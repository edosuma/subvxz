Hey, you two, be careful in
there.

00:51.641 --> 00:53.843
We're gonna find
the old telescope, Lilly.

00:53.876 --> 00:56.546

treasure hunting, too!

Braved the stormy seas
with a young fisherman named Fitz.

01:20.736 --> 01:23.172
Suddenly they
came upon a gigantic rock

01:23.206 --> 01:25.175
And the sea became so rough

01:25.208 --> 01:26.611
The little boat crashed!

01:27.578 --> 01:28.579
Breaking in half

01:28.611 --> 01:30.080
Oh No!

11:54.203 --> 11:55.439
Chin up, Daniel.

11:56.539 --> 11:59.543
When a door closes, a window
opens.

12:00.175 --> 12:01.710
What are you looking at Lilly?

12:01.743 --> 12:03.345

14:52.482 --> 14:54.318
I'll be back soon, amigo.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.694
Max,
your sister made your bed, again

15:05.727 --> 15:06.662
Thanks, Sis.

15:07.697 --> 15:08.665
Allen wrench, please.

15:08.698 --> 15:09.466
Which one's Allen?

15:09.498 --> 15:11.734
It's the anodized dark metal
one,

15:11.968 --> 15:13.670
1/4" in diameter

15:13.703 --> 15:15.872
and approximately
six inches in length

15:15.905 --> 15:17.973
with a 90 degree
angle four inches from...

15:18.006 --> 15:19.976
It's like a small boomerang,
Lilly.

15:20.343 --> 15:20.943
Oh, got it.

15:20.977 --> 15:22.444
Toss it on up, Katie Lynn.

15:22.477 --> 15:23.979
Here you go, Will.

15:24.012 --> 15:26.415
I hope it doesn't take too
long to fix that cockamamy cuckoo.

15:26.449 --> 15:27.983
Oooh...

15:28.016 --> 15:28.818
Oh, just need to juggle
around a few things, first.

15:28.851 --> 15:29.819
But no worries...

15:29.852 --> 15:30.821
Will Patchitt!

15:33.054 --> 15:35.024
Huh? What's so funny?

15:35.056 --> 15:36.456
Yeah?

15:36.458 --> 15:37.626
. - Oh.
- Did we miss something?

15:37.660 --> 15:39.094
Oh, it has to do with the
first time Lilly and I met.

15:39.127 --> 15:40.463
Really? What Happened?

15:40.496 --> 15:41.631
You don't know the story?

15:41.664 --> 15:42.899
. - No..
- Come on. . Fill us in.

15:42.931 --> 15:43.766
Tell us.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.601
You tell em, Lilly.

15:44.633 --> 15:45.968
Oh no no, I want to hear you
tell it.

15:46.001 --> 15:47.270
You tell em.

15:47.304 --> 15:49.105
You know If I tell the story,
you're going to interrupt me.

15:49.137 --> 15:50.574
I promise I won't, I promise, I promise.
Please.....

15:51.040 --> 15:51.675
Go ahead.

15:51.940 --> 15:52.608
All right.

15:52.641 --> 15:54.544
It was a dark and dreary day.

15:56.846 --> 15:57.679
Hello....

15:57.713 --> 15:58.848
No no no no no, it wasn't,

15:58.881 --> 16:00.650
It was a bright and sun... I'm

16:01.617 --> 16:02.586
Very sorry

16:04.987 --> 16:05.554
Hello?

16:05.588 --> 16:06.488
Watch the leak.

16:06.521 --> 16:07.523
Will Patchitt

16:07.556 --> 16:09.091
Really? You think you can?

16:09.357 --> 16:11.428
Hi... I'm Lilly Ann Beacon.

16:11.460 --> 16:12.060
Will Patchitt

16:12.093 --> 16:13.061
Oh, that's great.

16:13.094 --> 16:15.531
It's going to be a really hard
job ‘cause

16:15.564 --> 16:16.532
there's a leak over here

16:17.500 --> 16:18.702
and then there's another one
over here,

16:19.669 --> 16:21.938
and... as far as I can see there's
areally big one right there.

16:22.137 --> 16:23.607
I didn't get your name.

16:23.872 --> 16:26.542
Don't worry... Will Patchitt.

16:26.575 --> 16:28.010
That's wonderful.

16:28.410 --> 16:30.546
So, when can you start,
Mr....uh... Mr...?

16:30.579 --> 16:32.714
The name is... Will Patchitt.

16:32.747 --> 16:34.717
Oh...

16:34.750 --> 16:38.221
. AAH!!

16:38.253 --> 16:40.589
How 'bout I startright
now!

16:43.925 --> 16:46.195
...and that's exactly how it
happened!

16:46.228 --> 16:47.830
Ay yi yi

16:48.131 --> 16:49.165
It is!

16:59.909 --> 17:01.578
Checking for monsters, again?

17:02.944 --> 17:04.981
You don't understand, Max.

17:05.246 --> 17:08.983
What if I told you, I was afraid of
monsters when I was your age, too.

17:09.018 --> 17:10.854
Get out of here!

17:10.886 --> 17:15.023
It's true. I even drew the scariest
one on my computer. Wanna' see?

17:19.560 --> 17:23.500
That's not scary at all.
Mine are real scary.

17:23.531 --> 17:26.069
Well, describe yours and I'll
draw them.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.502
Okay.

17:27.971 --> 17:30.839
One's got these really huge bug
eyes,

17:30.873 --> 17:34.511
a big nose... with bumps all
over it.

17:34.777 --> 17:37.514
The other
one's got this pointy chin

17:37.547 --> 17:39.583
with really sharp teeth

17:40.282 --> 17:41.617
and wolf ears.

17:41.651 --> 17:45.589
And they're both an ugly green
color.

17:46.088 --> 17:47.223
How's that?

17:47.255 --> 17:48.257
Pretty close.

17:48.491 --> 17:49.925
They are kinda' scary.

17:49.959 --> 17:53.296
But, what if... every time you thought
of them, they looked like this.

17:56.799 --> 17:58.702
They're not scary at all.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.303
If you get scared again, just
remember....

18:01.337 --> 18:03.973
you have the power to change
the way you see things.

18:04.507 --> 18:07.243
A little lighthouse philosophy,
huh, Max?

18:07.276 --> 18:08.245
You're very wise.

18:08.911 --> 18:09.880
Thanks, Max.

18:11.246 --> 18:12.047
Tikka tikka tikka

18:18.087 --> 18:20.723
So that's how
Crum and Mudge came to be.

18:20.755 --> 18:22.324
Several years ago

18:22.357 --> 18:24.594
Katie Lynn's silly monsters.

18:24.926 --> 18:27.263
We sure have
changed a lot since then.

18:27.998 --> 18:30.567
I can't wait to meet Max and
Ashley!

18:30.599 --> 18:31.934
They'll be home for the
holidays.

18:31.967 --> 18:34.336
I'm glad you're still here,
Katie-Lynn!

18:34.369 --> 18:36.939
Me too, but I'll be off
to college next year.

18:36.973 --> 18:39.608
Are all of the lighthouse
adventures in this book?

18:39.642 --> 18:41.678
Every adventure of the heart!

18:41.711 --> 18:45.315
How come it's down here
and we've never seen it before?

18:45.348 --> 18:48.885
It only appears when we're ready
to discover what's inside!

18:49.251 --> 18:50.153
How true!

18:50.586 --> 18:51.220
Awesome!

18:51.253 --> 18:51.887

crooked when you found it, Uncle Fitz?

19:12.808 --> 19:16.112
Yeah, it must have fallen out of
their suitcase and onto the rocks.

Hmm, mm

20:49.739 --> 20:50.273
Hey, Fitz

20:51.840 --> 20:52.841
Hey, Daniel

21:01.349 --> 21:03.086
Had a big catch today.

21:03.118 --> 21:04.953
Take this to your grandmother.

21:05.820 --> 21:06.355
Thanks.

21:06.387 --> 21:07.357
Yeah

21:12.360 --> 21:13.929
What do you say, Fitz?

21:13.963 --> 21:14.497
Hi.

21:14.530 --> 21:15.364
Hey, you know that boy?

21:15.396 --> 21:16.465
Daniel? Sure.

21:16.499 --> 21:17.934
I been looking for him

21:17.966 --> 21:20.802
He just left home a couple of days ago.
His grandmother passed away.

21:20.836 --> 21:22.405
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

21:22.437 --> 21:24.139
Yeah, He doesn't have any other
family.

21:24.173 --> 21:27.210
I been trying to get him up to
Lilly's Foster home.

21:27.609 --> 21:29.511
Officer Newelly,
I'm headed up there myself.

21:29.544 --> 21:32.047
I'd appreciate it if you'd
let me take care of it.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.283
His grandmother was a friend of
mine.

21:34.550 --> 21:35.818
Yeah? You got it.

21:35.850 --> 21:36.718
All right.

21:36.751 --> 21:38.421
Heh, heh, Glad to have you back
on land.

21:38.453 --> 21:39.222
Thank You

21:39.254 --> 21:39.988
Heard you had a good catch.
I did.

21:40.021 --> 21:41.456
See you later.

21:41.490 --> 21:42.125
Ok

21:46.995 --> 21:48.830
Hey Daniel, You hungry?

21:48.864 --> 21:49.833
Mmm

22:10.418 --> 22:13.255
Ladies... could you set another
place at the table, please?

22:16.058 --> 22:18.560
Rah Rah Coo Coo

22:18.594 --> 22:20.163
Hey, the old bird works!

22:20.195 --> 22:22.231
I knew Will could patch it.

22:22.263 --> 22:24.433
Repairman extraordinaire

22:24.465 --> 22:25.333
Impressive.

22:25.367 --> 22:26.568
Oh, nothing to it.

22:26.601 --> 22:29.104
It was merely the sprocket
spring needing some tinkering.

22:29.504 --> 22:30.305
Genius

22:30.338 --> 22:33.275
Whaaa Whoa...!

22:33.309 --> 22:34.242
Be careful!

22:34.276 --> 22:36.813
Whoa... whoa, whoa!

22:37.413 --> 22:38.848
He's gonna fall! Yeow!

22:38.880 --> 22:39.815
Watch out!

22:41.050 --> 22:43.552
Don't worry, he used to be a
circus performer. Remember?

22:43.586 --> 22:46.856
Woah woah woah woah

22:46.888 --> 22:47.857
Woooo!

22:51.424 --> 22:52.261
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

22:52.293 --> 22:53.461
Bravo, Bravo

22:53.494 --> 22:55.363
How I do miss the smell of
greasepaint.

22:55.396 --> 22:57.532
And elephant poop?

22:57.566 --> 23:01.571
But, I'd stay away from clock
repair, if I were you.

23:01.604 --> 23:02.538
I agree.

23:02.570 --> 23:03.805
Sorry, Will.

23:03.838 --> 23:06.274
You better ask Professor Crabbe
to tinker with this contraption.

23:06.308 --> 23:07.475
That's a good idea.

23:07.509 --> 23:10.046
A wacky clock might need a wacky
inventor.

23:10.078 --> 23:12.882
But, you'll still be our
repairman extraordinaire.

23:12.915 --> 23:13.549
Aw, shucks

23:13.581 --> 23:14.550
Heh heh.

23:14.783 --> 23:15.984
Well, catch you in a few, crew.

23:16.251 --> 23:18.187
Well, here... There you go.

23:19.355 --> 23:20.356
Bye, Thank You

23:21.056 --> 23:22.058
Oh!

23:23.524 --> 23:25.160
It's Peaches and Dee

23:25.194 --> 23:28.263
Dee and Peaches
... Oh...

23:29.964 --> 23:30.966
Oh.....

23:31.300 --> 23:32.033
Will...

23:32.067 --> 23:33.001
Will....

23:33.034 --> 23:33.935
Ladies.

23:33.969 --> 23:34.971
Bye, Will.

23:35.203 --> 23:36.004
Ciao

23:36.405 --> 23:37.339
What's all this?

23:37.373 --> 23:39.175
Well, we brought treats!

23:39.207 --> 23:42.077
My homemade Peaches pie!

23:42.110 --> 23:43.145
Mmmm
My Favorite!

23:43.177 --> 23:45.982
And I don't know what possessed
me,

23:46.014 --> 23:49.618
but wait til you
try my special recipe-

23:49.652 --> 23:52.088
A la Casa Deevarella-

23:52.120 --> 23:57.092
My Muchos........ Grandes....
Quay-sah-dillas.

23:57.559 --> 23:57.960
Yum

23:57.992 --> 23:59.595
Just perfect.

23:59.627 --> 24:02.564
For the last time... it's
Kay-suh-deeya.

24:02.865 --> 24:04.901
What makes you the expert.

24:05.367 --> 24:06.335
They both smell terrific.

24:06.367 --> 24:07.669
Well, like I told you,

24:07.703 --> 24:11.641
the double L in Spanish makes a
"YA" sound.

24:11.674 --> 24:13.341
"Dee-Ya"! "Dee-Ya"!

24:13.375 --> 24:16.311
I'm gonna "Dee-You" if you don't
be quiet. Ugh!

24:16.345 --> 24:17.280
Huh!

24:18.379 --> 24:20.982
Dee-ya, see-ya, wouldn't wanna'
be-ya.

24:21.015 --> 24:24.152
Huh.. Lilly.
Argh.

24:25.253 --> 24:26.088
Bye, Kids!

24:26.121 --> 24:27.890
.- Lilly...
- . Thank You

24:31.626 --> 24:34.297
A day's not complete without
Peaches and Dee.

24:34.329 --> 24:35.298
Dee and Peaches!

24:36.464 --> 24:37.466
You're right!

24:41.703 --> 24:42.638
Knock, Knock

24:44.405 --> 24:46.575
Hi, Uncle Fitz!

24:46.607 --> 24:48.109
Wow!

24:48.143 --> 24:49.112
Fresh fish.

24:49.544 --> 24:50.545
Look at that!

24:51.746 --> 24:53.415
Welcome Back
Thank You

24:53.448 --> 24:55.383
That is an enormous fish!

24:55.416 --> 24:58.021
Max, why don't you take the fish
from Uncle Fitz?

24:58.587 --> 25:00.056
AAAGH

25:00.088 --> 25:01.123
I guess that you get to gut 'em.

25:01.155 --> 25:02.959
I decline the offer, thank
you.

25:03.692 --> 25:05.027
Don't look at me.

25:06.395 --> 25:08.964
So, I take it you got my lunch
invitation via carrier pelican.

25:08.998 --> 25:09.598
I sure did.

25:09.630 --> 25:10.431
Good

25:10.464 --> 25:12.467
A peligram from the infamous Pel
Mel.

25:13.769 --> 25:15.671
By the way, I hope you don't
mind, I invited someone else.

25:15.703 --> 25:16.973
Oh, I was hoping you would.

25:17.005 --> 25:17.973
All right.

25:18.540 --> 25:19.708
I'd like you all to meet...

25:19.742 --> 25:21.543
Hi Daniel. I'm Lilly.

25:21.577 --> 25:22.545
Nice to meet you.

25:22.810 --> 25:24.012
...and that's Max and Ashley...

25:24.413 --> 25:24.980
Hi

25:25.013 --> 25:25.947
and Katie Lynn.

25:25.981 --> 25:27.316
Hi Hey

25:27.348 --> 25:28.349
How'd you know my...

25:28.384 --> 25:28.916
Come on in, you two.
I hope you're hungry?

25:28.951 --> 25:30.353
Right

25:34.490 --> 25:38.327
Mmm, everything smells divine,
Lilly, and we're starvin'.

25:38.359 --> 25:41.229
You certainly were out to sea
for a long time, Uncle Fitz.

25:41.696 --> 25:42.698
That's the life of a fisherman.

25:42.898 --> 25:44.099
And I love it.

25:45.367 --> 25:48.570
Seems like a lot of strenuous
physical activity if you ask me.

25:48.870 --> 25:49.973
Ya think?

25:50.839 --> 25:51.808
Well, It can be demanding on the
body,

25:51.840 --> 25:55.610
but it sure feeds my soul and
clears my mind.

25:55.644 --> 25:58.080
Does it ever make you seasick?

25:59.014 --> 26:00.682
The first couple of times
my Pop took me out,

26:00.715 --> 26:03.386
but then I was a little
tyke....like you.

26:04.386 --> 26:06.388
Well, looks like
from the size of that catch

26:06.422 --> 26:09.025
you must have netted in a
pretty big haul this time.

26:10.526 --> 26:12.128
The biggest ever.

26:12.161 --> 26:15.298
Being a fisherman sure sounds
intriguing.

26:16.298 --> 26:18.300
Maybe that's the career for me.

26:19.034 --> 26:21.803
Hello! It's an outdoor
life.

26:21.837 --> 26:24.640
Not what I would suggest for
a computer nerd.

26:25.406 --> 26:27.609
Now, for me, it could be the
ticket.

26:28.444 --> 26:29.678
I can see it, now.

26:29.944 --> 26:31.146
All hands on deck.

26:31.513 --> 26:33.148
Aye aye, Captain.

26:33.182 --> 26:34.150
Real cute, guys.

26:35.349 --> 26:36.785
Am I really that bossy?

26:36.819 --> 26:37.819
No comment.

26:37.853 --> 26:39.055
Max.

26:39.088 --> 26:40.088
Sometimes.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.760
But I'll still be your first
mate.

26:46.194 --> 26:48.798
What about you, Daniel?
Are you a fisherman, too?

26:49.330 --> 26:51.767
Nah. I grew up on a farm.

26:52.768 --> 26:54.336
Never had the chance to try it.

26:54.368 --> 26:55.437
Uncle Fitz can show you how.

26:55.471 --> 26:55.972
Uh huh

26:56.004 --> 26:56.838
He taught all of us.

26:56.873 --> 26:59.208
You might even acquire a taste
for it.

27:00.442 --> 27:01.809
Well, in the mean time,

27:01.844 --> 27:04.246
I think Daniel could use some
more Quay-sah-dillas, Uncle Fitz.

27:06.482 --> 27:07.250
It's a joke.

27:08.384 --> 27:11.153
So I'm confused...
Whose uncle are you, anyways?

27:11.185 --> 27:13.422
He's..... everybody's.

27:13.454 --> 27:15.223
But not in a biological way.

27:15.857 --> 27:17.460
They adopted me.

27:17.492 --> 27:18.426
That's right.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.661
Except for Max and Ashley,

27:19.694 --> 27:22.064
we're all a little short on
biological family around here.

27:22.898 --> 27:29.171
Well, I'd be, too... If I
didn't have... a real abuelita

27:30.138 --> 27:31.139
What's that?

27:32.206 --> 27:34.576
That's spanish for grandmother,
right?

27:35.310 --> 27:38.747
Yeah... It's just that..My
grandma's...

27:40.682 --> 27:42.418
...well, she's...

27:43.519 --> 27:44.520
Never mind.

27:45.753 --> 27:47.389
Is your farm around here?

27:48.723 --> 27:52.794
Yeah, it was, but
I'm looking to move on.

27:53.796 --> 27:56.632
Well, Daniel, we hope you find
what you're looking for.

27:57.432 --> 28:00.769
Now, who wants some homemade
Peaches pie?

28:00.801 --> 28:01.435
Mmm

28:01.470 --> 28:03.573
No thanks, I'm on a budget.

28:03.873 --> 28:04.874
I mean a diet.

28:05.073 --> 28:05.974
Diet

28:06.008 --> 28:07.876
So, are you really the
lighthouse keeper?

28:07.909 --> 28:10.678
Oh, I am ever since I
restored this old place.

28:10.712 --> 28:12.581
But that's not all she does.

28:12.781 --> 28:13.949
Lilly and the kids get together

28:13.982 --> 28:17.352
and create marvelous storybooks
based on their adventures.

28:17.386 --> 28:17.953
Mmm Hmm

28:17.986 --> 28:19.220
Adventures?

28:19.254 --> 28:21.589
What kind of adventures could
you possibly find around here?

28:21.623 --> 28:23.192
Oh, you'd be surprised.

28:23.224 --> 28:24.760
With a little imagination...

28:24.792 --> 28:27.495
...the possibilities are
limitless.

28:27.529 --> 28:28.864
Can we show him, Lilly?

28:28.896 --> 28:29.831
Yeah!

28:29.865 --> 28:30.633
Why not?!

28:30.665 --> 28:31.666
Okay...

28:32.067 --> 28:33.636
Well, first, we start with an
idea

28:34.336 --> 28:35.371
Any idea.

28:35.404 --> 28:37.607
And everyone's imagination adds
to it.

28:38.107 --> 28:41.476
If we see it clear enough,
our beacon will illuminate it for us.

Do we wake him?

31:53.934 --> 31:55.503
Aw, hmm, umm..

31:56.405 --> 31:58.473
Ah,
Hello, Peasants!

31:58.507 --> 31:59.375
Hello

31:59.407 --> 32:01.876
Welcome to Hamelot!
My name is Moylin.

32:01.909 --> 32:03.678
I am the Wizard of Hog.

32:03.712 --> 32:05.881
Pleased to meet you Moylin.
I'm Li......

32:05.914 --> 32:10.453
I once served the legendary King Arthog.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

32:10.685 --> 32:12.120
There's a King Pig?

32:12.320 --> 32:13.521
Oh, that's dumb.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.123
Not in a pig kingdom!

32:15.156 --> 32:16.357
What?

32:16.392 --> 32:19.027
You've never heard of King
Arthog and his Round Trough?

32:19.059 --> 32:21.597
King Arthur and the round table,
maybe,

32:21.629 --> 32:23.732
but we're all a little
in the dark on this one.

32:23.764 --> 32:25.566
Ah, you poor peasants...

32:25.599 --> 32:29.804
Well, allow me to enlighten you,
my friends, Ha Ha

32:29.838 --> 32:33.442
You have just entered the land
of a most noble king.

32:33.474 --> 32:35.610
My Royal subjects

32:36.011 --> 32:38.113
Oooh

32:38.146 --> 32:41.750
There was a time... not too long
ago,

32:41.782 --> 32:46.488
when Hamelot was the place that
every pig in the world wanted to be.

32:46.922 --> 32:50.092
It truly was... Hog Heaven!

32:50.125 --> 32:51.760
Aaah!

32:54.963 --> 32:55.731
We're all ears.

32:55.763 --> 32:57.165
Come on, don't leave us hangin'!

32:58.165 --> 32:59.134
Moylin.

32:59.166 --> 33:01.436
Moylin

33:01.470 --> 33:03.137
Oh, Moylin...

33:04.606 --> 33:05.140
MOYLIN!

33:05.173 --> 33:06.942
What? yes, yes, yes.

33:06.974 --> 33:08.810
Ahem, where was I?

33:08.844 --> 33:09.645
Hog Heaven.

33:09.677 --> 33:10.712
...And it truly was.

33:10.744 --> 33:12.481
Yeah, right...

33:12.513 --> 33:14.015
King Arthog was married
to the

33:14.049 --> 33:14.750
...fair Lady Swine-avere
Excuse me.

33:14.782 --> 33:15.917
Oh Nice!

33:15.951 --> 33:18.153
He built the finest pig kingdom
in alF the land for her.

33:19.053 --> 33:20.855
Why, pigs came from all over the
world...

33:20.888 --> 33:23.458
to feast on his famous Round
Trough.

33:23.492 --> 33:24.593
Das hay is good, ya?

33:24.626 --> 33:27.061
Hay, This is for knights
only, you Cochon!

33:27.095 --> 33:29.598
All
knights to the jousting field.

33:29.630 --> 33:31.867
It IS the pig version of
Camelot.

33:31.899 --> 33:32.367
Mmm Hmm

33:32.401 --> 33:33.902
Shhh! Just listen.

33:33.935 --> 33:37.939
Among his loyal subjects was a most
trusted knight named, Sir Oinks-a-Lot.

33:37.973 --> 33:40.742
Sir Oinks-a-Lot,
also being the m-

33:41.710 --> 33:43.879
Also being the
m-

33:43.912 --> 33:46.682
handsomest knight in all the
land

33:46.714 --> 33:49.617
Caused all the pig maidens to
swoon.

33:53.053 --> 33:56.124
Unfortunately for the King,
so did Lady Swine-avere.

33:56.724 --> 34:00.529
Sir Oinks-a-Lot, I Love You!

34:03.232 --> 34:03.898
Uh, oh.

34:03.932 --> 34:04.732
Wait for me!

34:04.765 --> 34:06.100
Don't go, my queen!

34:06.134 --> 34:10.138
She fell so madly in love with
Sir Oinks-a-Lot, that she fled...

34:10.170 --> 34:11.005
I'm outta here.

34:12.172 --> 34:14.876
from the kingdom and has
not returned ...to this day.

34:14.909 --> 34:15.877
Uh... what?

34:20.281 --> 34:21.150
Here you go.

34:23.083 --> 34:24.985
Ppffffffffff...

34:25.018 --> 34:25.953
Eww..

34:25.985 --> 34:26.987
Uhhh

34:27.388 --> 34:28.556
Aww....Thank You.

34:28.589 --> 34:29.824
Oh, you keep it.

34:29.857 --> 34:30.757
Uhhhh

34:30.792 --> 34:33.027
Sir Oinks-a-Lot must have felt
terrible.

34:33.060 --> 34:34.196
It wasn't his fault.

34:34.228 --> 34:35.330
You're right.

34:35.362 --> 34:38.632
He couldn't help his good looks,
personality and charm,

34:38.667 --> 34:40.902
captivated the fair lady,

34:40.935 --> 34:42.771
...but feeling responsible
anyway

34:42.803 --> 34:46.908
he swore to use all his power
to keep the King's spirits up.

34:46.940 --> 34:47.876
What'd he do?

34:47.908 --> 34:49.777
He took to the stage!

34:50.043 --> 34:51.980
Let's welcome, Sir Oinks-A-Lot

34:52.013 --> 34:52.981
Uh, uh

34:53.013 --> 34:53.981
Thank you.

34:54.014 --> 34:55.551
Now, Thank you.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.319
Now.... For my first joke,

34:57.352 --> 35:00.622
Why did it take the pig so
many hours to cross the road?

35:00.655 --> 35:01.589
Why?

35:01.622 --> 35:02.590
Because he was a slow pork!

35:04.292 --> 35:05.260
Get it?

35:05.292 --> 35:06.294
Anybody?

35:06.794 --> 35:07.997
Is this thing on?

35:08.196 --> 35:09.030
Uh,

35:10.097 --> 35:11.099
Testing...

35:12.334 --> 35:15.638
Night after night he entertained
the King with all his might.

35:15.903 --> 35:17.705
Know what you call a pig in a
bathtub?

35:17.738 --> 35:18.973
Hog wash.

35:19.006 --> 35:20.608
What do you call a pig that does
Karate?

35:20.642 --> 35:22.044
Pork Chop!

35:22.377 --> 35:25.614
He became the wittiest headliner
at the palace.

35:25.647 --> 35:28.817
What do you call a giant hog
with wings and yellow feathers?

35:28.850 --> 35:29.785
PIG BIRD

35:29.818 --> 35:30.819
Thank you very much.

35:31.819 --> 35:33.955
And why should you never tell
a pig a secret?

35:33.988 --> 35:34.956
Why?

35:34.990 --> 35:35.991
Because they squeal!

35:37.057 --> 35:38.225
Sounds like a real "ham".

35:38.258 --> 35:39.961
Huh, now that's funny.

35:40.461 --> 35:42.229
I'd like to meet this Sir
Oinks-a-lot?

35:42.263 --> 35:43.865
You can catch him at the castle.

35:43.897 --> 35:45.633
He's doing eight shows a day.

35:45.667 --> 35:46.669
Grueling.

35:47.035 --> 35:47.903
Not anymore!

35:47.935 --> 35:50.271
Well, Hello Dilly and Dally!

35:50.472 --> 35:54.743
I haven't seen you two since the King
pulled the sword out of the stone.

35:54.776 --> 35:57.646
Sir Oinks-A-Lot has been banned
from the castle!

35:57.678 --> 36:00.081
What? He's missing!!?

36:00.115 --> 36:01.917
And he's distraught!

36:01.950 --> 36:03.352
He's got no home now.

36:03.385 --> 36:06.254
Sounds like he's having a real
identity crisis.

36:06.287 --> 36:08.022
But he's a star

36:08.055 --> 36:10.191
It happens to celebrities.

36:10.392 --> 36:12.794
Well... We want to help him.

36:12.827 --> 36:14.629
Then let's go find him.

36:14.662 --> 36:15.830
What does he look like?

36:15.863 --> 36:16.831
A pig...

36:16.865 --> 36:19.001
...in shining armor.

36:19.033 --> 36:23.705
I think I saw him earlier.
And he didn't seem very happy.

36:25.339 --> 36:27.977
You're right! I'm not.

36:29.044 --> 36:30.045
I think we found him.

36:30.511 --> 36:31.812
Oink!

36:31.845 --> 36:34.048
That's Sir Oinks-a-lot to you.

36:34.082 --> 36:35.084
Oh, Oh, Sir.

36:37.352 --> 36:40.288
I can't be a stand-up comedi-ham
anymore!

36:40.321 --> 36:43.992
Oh, Sir, May we have your
autograph?

36:44.024 --> 36:46.694
We're big fans, from
Peasantville.

36:46.727 --> 36:47.762
Peasantville?

36:47.796 --> 36:51.133
What? Peasantville,
it's a suburb of Hamelot.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.100
Oh!

36:52.133 --> 36:53.135
Ugh

36:53.535 --> 36:57.339
Oh, You have been our
inspiration.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.141
Knock, knock.

37:00.175 --> 37:01.142
Who's there?

37:01.176 --> 37:02.144
Dilly.

37:02.176 --> 37:04.680
Dilly whooo?

37:05.479 --> 37:07.281
I didn't know you could yodel,
Dally.

37:08.982 --> 37:09.984
Knock Knock! Oh!

37:10.785 --> 37:11.618
That's funny

37:11.653 --> 37:13.789
Oh, brother... What ham I going
to do?

37:13.821 --> 37:15.823
Sounds like you're really
stuck in the mud.

37:16.024 --> 37:19.461
You have no idea. I've lost everything.
My job... my home... I'm nothing.

37:19.493 --> 37:20.796
I know that feeling

37:20.828 --> 37:22.229
Wait a minute, both of you.

37:22.263 --> 37:24.033
That's simply not true.

37:24.932 --> 37:26.834
You always have you.

37:27.202 --> 37:31.073
And everything you'll ever need
is right inside of you.

37:31.439 --> 37:32.374
It is?

37:32.406 --> 37:33.774
Even if you can't change
your circumstances,

37:33.807 --> 37:37.245
you always have the power to
change the way you feel about them.

37:37.511 --> 37:38.180
I do?

37:38.213 --> 37:39.113
Will you try something for me?

37:39.147 --> 37:41.383
At this point, I'm open for
suggestions.

37:41.883 --> 37:44.386
Good.
Now, repeat after me.

37:44.718 --> 37:46.155
I am what I am

37:47.555 --> 37:51.359
..and I know inside me I will
find everything I was meant to be.

37:52.060 --> 37:53.195
Now you try.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.829
I ham what I ham...

37:56.698 --> 37:59.100
Oh... This is ridiculous.

37:59.133 --> 38:02.269
Stop your squealing. Crew.....
need a little assistance.

38:02.303 --> 38:03.305
Try it again.

38:04.171 --> 38:05.906
Maybe this will help.

38:05.941 --> 38:09.944
Nice music you got here.

38:10.312 --> 38:11.313

38:18.385 --> 38:19.353

Well, Sir Oinks-a-lot,
how do you feel now?

39:40.435 --> 39:41.536
Ready to start a new life?

39:41.569 --> 39:44.205
I'm ready! It doesn't get better
than the skin you're in.

39:44.238 --> 39:45.973
The piggy skin you're in.
The piggy skin you're in.

39:46.006 --> 39:48.075
What you see is what you get.
Yeah!

39:49.644 --> 39:52.347
You really tickle my ham bone.

39:52.647 --> 39:54.850
We've been following your act
for years.

39:54.883 --> 39:56.551
We know your whole routine!

39:56.752 --> 39:57.719
You do?

39:57.752 --> 40:00.021
Why, enough jokes to fill
the Round Trough.

40:00.053 --> 40:00.588
Ha ha

40:00.620 --> 40:02.191
You're so silly, Dilly!

40:02.423 --> 40:04.391
Dilly and Dally, show him what
you got.

40:09.196 --> 40:11.432
How do you catch a unique pig?

40:11.665 --> 40:13.001
Unique up on it.

40:13.033 --> 40:14.869
Ha, ha, ha, ha!!!

40:15.269 --> 40:18.505
Did you hear about the new ride
at Piggyland?

40:18.539 --> 40:23.410
Yeah, it's called
Sueeee-wheeeeet!

40:24.444 --> 40:25.345
What?

40:25.379 --> 40:29.251
What do you call a pig with
laryngitis?

40:29.283 --> 40:31.519
Disgruntled.

40:34.488 --> 40:38.926
What's invisible and smells like
corn?

40:39.227 --> 40:41.062
Pig breath.

40:42.397 --> 40:43.632
Well, that's really funny!

40:43.664 --> 40:45.599
Wow! You really do know my
routine.

40:45.633 --> 40:47.401
It's a real show stopper, all
right.

40:47.435 --> 40:48.503
I really ham a ham....

40:48.535 --> 40:50.571
Dilly, Dally, I think we should
do an act together.

40:50.604 --> 40:52.439
...And take it on the road?

40:52.472 --> 40:53.407

41:40.655 --> 41:41.622
How fun!

41:43.256 --> 41:46.126
We've had a lot of adventures
since then!

41:46.160 --> 41:47.562
We sure have!

41:47.595 --> 41:50.497
How would you know?
We're always stuck in these pipes!

41:50.531 --> 41:53.668
I wanna see more.
Stop your crummy interruptions.

41:54.669 --> 41:56.437
Well, open the book Charlie.

41:56.470 --> 41:57.705
Yay!

41:59.106 --> 42:01.041
Well, Thanks for the wonderful
adventure.

42:01.075 --> 42:03.243
But I'd better get the rest of
my catch on ice

42:03.276 --> 42:05.579
or it'll be the smallest haul
I've ever had.

42:05.613 --> 42:07.582
We wouldn't want to be
responsible for that.

42:08.214 --> 42:09.751
Hope to see you around, Daniel.

42:09.783 --> 42:12.019
Later.
Bye, Uncle Fitz Bye

42:13.053 --> 42:14.322
Thanks for the fish.

42:15.390 --> 42:16.124
Hey crew

42:16.990 --> 42:18.392
Why don't you show Daniel your
rooms?

42:19.493 --> 42:20.729
Aye Aye, Captain!

42:20.928 --> 42:22.396
Let's start over here.

42:22.430 --> 42:24.132
This is where you sleep?

42:24.164 --> 42:26.166
Yeah. Isn't it neat?

42:26.200 --> 42:28.002
My bed's over there.

42:28.035 --> 42:31.106
We have an extra bunk,
if you ever need a place to stay.

42:31.138 --> 42:34.309
Ah, thanks, but like I said,
I'm moving on.

42:34.341 --> 42:36.979
Besides, I really don't fit in
here.

42:37.678 --> 42:40.180
Well, thanks for everything you
guys.

42:40.214 --> 42:41.216
It was a first.

42:42.517 --> 42:42.984
Adios, guys.

42:43.017 --> 42:44.986
Adios... Bye... Bye.

42:47.354 --> 42:48.889
Why'd he leave?

42:48.923 --> 42:53.361
Yeah, I was just about to give him my
lucky shell to make him feel welcome.

42:54.194 --> 42:55.196
I had the same idea.

42:55.397 --> 42:57.399
I was going to give him my sand
dollar.

42:59.466 --> 43:00.535
I was in the midst of
contemplating

43:00.568 --> 43:03.504
just how to set him up
with his own email address.

43:04.338 --> 43:05.540
I wish he'd stayed.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.274
He's so lonely.

43:07.508 --> 43:08.810
He needs us.

43:08.843 --> 43:10.278
He'll be back.

43:39.640 --> 43:40.607
Aahhh

43:40.640 --> 43:42.443
Sorry to be gone so long, Oink.

43:43.644 --> 43:44.611
You hungry?

43:45.446 --> 43:46.414
Try these.

43:46.446 --> 43:48.182
Quay-sa-dillas

43:49.316 --> 43:51.752
Yeah yeah... quesadillas, I know.

43:53.821 --> 43:55.257
They're not bad.

43:57.591 --> 43:59.493
I met some really interesting
people today.

44:00.193 --> 44:01.595
They live up in the old
lighthouse.

44:03.363 --> 44:04.365
It's pretty cool inside.

44:07.267 --> 44:09.603
They said I could stay there if
I don't have a place to sleep.

44:11.339 --> 44:13.308
Don't worry. I'm not leaving
you buddy.

44:13.941 --> 44:16.310
Besides, I don't want any new
friends.

44:19.379 --> 44:22.249
Aw, great... I left my backpack
up there.

44:24.218 --> 44:25.654
Better go and get it.

44:26.086 --> 44:27.289
I'll be right back, all right?

44:31.492 --> 44:32.493
I have to go.

44:33.461 --> 44:34.463
I have to go, I have to go.

44:40.767 --> 44:43.170
Here's a little something I
crafted for the occasion.

44:43.470 --> 44:46.273
Friends together, friends apart,
friends forever in the heart.

44:46.307 --> 44:47.908
Oh, it's so neat!

44:47.941 --> 44:49.510
Gee, I thought you made that
for me.

44:49.544 --> 44:51.746
How could I, we're hardly ever
apart.

44:51.778 --> 44:54.715
Hey, I thought ..
how 'bout we hang it up on the wall?

44:54.749 --> 44:56.417
That's a great idea.

44:56.450 --> 44:57.919
Oh, don't worry about any supplies.
We've got you covered.

44:57.952 --> 45:00.354
Oh, thanks, you two. I hope
he'll like the surprise.

45:00.388 --> 45:01.356
I'm sure he will.

45:01.622 --> 45:02.624
See ya.

45:17.238 --> 45:18.740
Let's see, Professor Crabbe.

45:18.939 --> 45:22.476
Here you go, Max.
At your request.

45:22.910 --> 45:25.413
All right!
Thanks, professor.

45:25.446 --> 45:28.415
I have to say,
it's my most ingenious invention yet.

45:28.448 --> 45:31.251
I call it... the
Illuminating-Imaginator.

45:31.285 --> 45:32.254
Oh, cool.

45:32.586 --> 45:33.588
Fascinating...

45:34.921 --> 45:38.559
That's a long name.
Could we call it the "Illiator" for short?

45:38.593 --> 45:40.728
I like the sound of that.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.963
The "Illiator". How's it work?

45:42.997 --> 45:46.434
Well, let's start with an image
on your computer. Anything.

45:48.002 --> 45:49.437
How 'bout these?

45:51.339 --> 45:52.574
My silly monsters.

45:52.606 --> 45:54.341
Cute little curmudgeons.
Perfect.

45:54.975 --> 45:56.678
What's a cu-jer-mudgeon?

45:56.711 --> 45:58.745
That's curmudgeon.

45:58.778 --> 46:01.949
And it usually means someone
ill-tempered, crusty and...

46:01.982 --> 46:03.984
Oh... crabby!

46:04.017 --> 46:05.218
Oh.

46:05.252 --> 46:07.622
Good,
now to download the images from the

46:07.655 --> 46:09.390
screen you press this button,
here.

46:09.423 --> 46:10.959
..and this button, here.

46:13.595 --> 46:17.665
The images are now transferred
into the device and the fun begins.

46:17.698 --> 46:18.232
Brilliant!

46:18.265 --> 46:19.401
Oh, but there's more.

46:20.234 --> 46:21.803
I'll teach you how to operate
it.

46:21.836 --> 46:26.441
...but first, I promised Will I'd
take a look at that old Cuckcoo clock.

46:26.473 --> 46:27.742
Oh yeah! That's right.

46:27.776 --> 46:30.645
Can you explain it to
us while you work, Professor?

46:30.678 --> 46:32.948
Why not?
Shall we?

46:46.894 --> 46:48.562
You must be the famous, Pel Mel.

46:49.597 --> 46:51.232
Nice to meet you.

46:52.332 --> 46:54.903
So, are you really a carrier
pelican?

46:55.569 --> 46:57.004
Are you sending a Peligram?

46:57.037 --> 47:00.641
No, I, uh... I left my backpack
here.

47:00.675 --> 47:01.642
Oh.

47:01.943 --> 47:03.912
Does he really deliver messages?

47:04.211 --> 47:06.347
Yeah. He's pretty amazing.

47:06.781 --> 47:11.620
Uh, you need to, uh, use the phone?
You can always do that, you know.

47:12.120 --> 47:14.756
No, there's no point.

47:15.455 --> 47:16.223
Besides,

47:16.256 --> 47:18.992
I don't
talk to that many people.

47:19.026 --> 47:19.993
Then, I'm honored.

47:20.026 --> 47:24.031
Well, I mean,
I used to talk to my grandma.

47:24.698 --> 47:27.769
but, now that she's not here
anymore...

47:28.035 --> 47:30.504
and, well, my other friends...

47:31.138 --> 47:32.707
I had to leave them behind.

47:33.374 --> 47:35.644
That must have been so
hard for you, Daniel.

47:36.510 --> 47:37.778
Now you're on your own?

47:39.780 --> 47:41.283
You know, I grew up an orphan.

47:41.915 --> 47:44.285
So, I learned to make a family
out of my friends.

47:44.952 --> 47:49.489
I think you'll find that you can make some
new friends here, if you give 'em a chance.

47:49.522 --> 47:50.858
I don't want any new friends.

47:51.758 --> 47:53.294
The minute you love someone,

47:53.694 --> 47:54.696
either you lose them...

47:55.629 --> 47:56.631
or they lose you.

47:57.631 --> 47:59.533
That's a pretty tough
philosophy to live by.

47:59.566 --> 48:00.534
Yeah, I'm used to it.

48:01.035 --> 48:03.805
Don't care, don't cry, don't
feel,

48:03.838 --> 48:04.805
No shame.

48:05.238 --> 48:07.641
Courage.... is my middle name.

48:08.908 --> 48:10.010
Muy Bueno!

48:10.343 --> 48:12.079
You come up with that yourself?

48:13.381 --> 48:14.415
You know, Daniel,

48:14.448 --> 48:17.751
Circumstances are sometimes
beyond your control.

48:18.486 --> 48:20.821
But nothing is beyond your
heart.

48:21.823 --> 48:25.660
I know it took a lot of courage for
you to say goodbye to someone you love.

48:25.693 --> 48:27.861
But it takes a lot more
courage...

48:27.894 --> 48:32.566
...to let yourself feel all the
things life throws your way.

48:33.501 --> 48:34.636
Yeah, well...

48:35.135 --> 48:36.338
Thanks for the advice..

48:36.970 --> 48:39.807
...but this heart is beyond
feeling.

So-

51:17.664 --> 51:19.032
Did we knock down any walls?

51:19.732 --> 51:20.602
To the ground.

51:21.734 --> 51:23.537
Why don't you stay with us,
Daniel?

51:23.970 --> 51:25.572
I can contact the proper
authorities

51:25.606 --> 51:27.242
And arrange everything, if you
like.

51:27.874 --> 51:28.842
Really?

51:28.876 --> 51:30.912
Yes, I think your new friends
would like that.

51:31.979 --> 51:32.981
So would I.

51:35.582 --> 51:37.885
Do you think he'll like it?
Yeah.... Shhh... it's a secret.

51:38.486 --> 51:40.054
Aye yi yi. What's all the
ruckus?

51:40.620 --> 51:42.189
Maybe you should go check it
out.

51:44.691 --> 51:46.093
Pel Mel, ole buddy...

51:46.794 --> 51:47.795
We did good.

51:49.763 --> 51:51.299
Raaahhh. You go girl!

51:52.633 --> 51:53.600
Here's the hammer, Will.

51:53.633 --> 51:54.635
Here he is.

51:55.002 --> 51:56.571
Oink! You're here!

51:56.604 --> 51:58.071
I can't believe it!

51:59.205 --> 52:00.240
Surprised?

52:00.274 --> 52:01.742
Yeah!
Come here, Oink.

52:01.774 --> 52:02.876
How'd you know?

52:02.910 --> 52:04.045
A little birdy told me.

52:04.077 --> 52:05.345
Are we keeping him, Lilly?

52:05.379 --> 52:06.180
Uh, huh.

52:06.213 --> 52:07.180
Cool.

52:07.214 --> 52:08.182
Thanks, Lilly.

52:08.214 --> 52:09.649
You sure got a swell pig there.

52:09.682 --> 52:10.917
I know.

52:10.950 --> 52:13.086
Well, now that the secret's out,
it's nice to meet you, Daniel.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.690
I'm.....Woah...

52:16.289 --> 52:17.291
Away he goes....

52:20.160 --> 52:21.162
Here, little piggy.

52:22.261 --> 52:24.332
He's gone hog wild.

52:26.633 --> 52:27.601
Come back here, little piggy!

52:27.635 --> 52:28.636
Oink!

52:30.269 --> 52:31.238
He's going under the sink.

52:31.705 --> 52:32.906
Oops!

52:33.774 --> 52:34.742
Al Patchitt.

52:34.774 --> 52:36.310
No, Will Patchitt.

52:36.678 --> 52:37.879
That's funny.

52:38.278 --> 52:39.946
OInk. Come on out of there.

52:39.979 --> 52:42.849
Daniel, I'm Will Patchitt and
this is my nephew...

52:42.883 --> 52:45.185
No, Let me guess. Al... Patchitt.

52:46.386 --> 52:47.321
Nice to meet you both.

52:47.354 --> 52:49.790
And Daniel,
That would be Professor Crabbe.

52:52.626 --> 52:53.828
Oh, ho!

52:54.827 --> 52:55.829
Good job.

52:56.763 --> 52:57.765
Hey, Oink.

53:04.238 --> 53:05.740
It's good to see you again,
amigo.

53:06.406 --> 53:07.709
I think you'll like it here.

53:08.709 --> 53:10.711
I've never seen hair like that
on a farm pig.

53:10.743 --> 53:13.347
He's not a farm pig. He's a
Vietnamese pot-bellied pig.

53:13.379 --> 53:14.381
Where'd you get him?

53:16.015 --> 53:18.785
Our neighbors owned him, but they had to
move to the city and couldn't keep him.

53:18.818 --> 53:20.053
So, you adopted him.

53:20.386 --> 53:21.421
I guess you could say that.

53:21.455 --> 53:24.659
Oink's been Daniel's friend
for a long time now.

53:24.691 --> 53:25.492
Yeah.

53:25.526 --> 53:27.395
And we thought pelicans were
cool.

53:27.428 --> 53:28.396
Ha ha ha

53:28.629 --> 53:30.431
Has anyone seen my illiator?

53:30.464 --> 53:31.198
Nope.

53:31.231 --> 53:32.232
It'll turn up.

53:33.334 --> 53:34.868
Well,
I think it's time for bed, everyone.

53:36.803 --> 53:38.006
Good night, Oink.

53:39.073 --> 53:40.074
Night.

53:42.008 --> 53:44.310
I thought you'd might like the
top bunk since you're the oldest.

53:44.343 --> 53:45.713
Thanks, bro.

53:48.214 --> 53:48.848
Ready?

53:48.881 --> 53:50.017
Oopsie-daisy

53:50.783 --> 53:51.785
There we go.

53:54.053 --> 53:57.425
I'm glad Oink and Daniel are
part of the family now.

53:57.457 --> 53:58.660
Me, too.

53:59.792 --> 54:02.329
Thank you for a wonderful day,
today.

54:02.729 --> 54:04.330
And may your next adventure...

54:04.363 --> 54:06.367
Start in your dreams.

54:06.399 --> 54:08.769
Can you sing us a song, Lilly?

54:08.801 --> 54:09.771
- Please?
- Yeah.

56:38.318 --> 56:40.120
We're in the book.
There's two of us.

56:40.153 --> 56:42.555
That means... I'm all heart!

56:42.589 --> 56:47.094
Well, I'm all heart, Crum,

heart, too.

56:51.198 --> 56:52.399
Anybody home?

56:52.432 --> 56:54.435
I came by to
fix the old telescope.

56:54.468 --> 56:56.036
We're down here, Will.

56:56.068 --> 56:57.271
There you are.

56:57.303 --> 56:58.905
HI.
Got a hand?

56:59.138 --> 56:59.573
Hi.

56:59.606 --> 57:00.573
Who are you?

57:00.606 --> 57:01.607
I'm Kenny.

57:01.642 --> 57:03.544
Kenny's my cousin
visiting from the mainland.

57:04.278 --> 57:05.412
Kenny Patchitt?

57:05.444 --> 57:06.412
Oh, yeah.

57:06.446 --> 57:08.049
I can, indeed.

57:08.281 --> 57:09.249
And guess what, crew...

57:09.283 --> 57:12.386
he loves to make music,
just like you, Lilly.

57:12.419 --> 57:12.920
Nice.

57:12.952 --> 57:13.419
Oh, yeah.

57:13.453 --> 57:14.588
Any chance I get.

57:14.620 --> 57:17.657
It's lovely to meet you, Kenny.
Welcome to Beacon's Bay.

57:17.691 --> 57:18.524
Thank you.

57:18.559 --> 57:20.093
Hey, did you find that old
telescope?

57:20.127 --> 57:21.095
Not yet.

57:21.127 --> 57:23.963
But we found the
Big Book of Little Adventures.

57:23.997 --> 57:26.300
Hey, did anybody else see that
spark?

57:26.600 --> 57:27.568
Oh, yeah.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.602
It's the light of creativity.

57:29.635 --> 57:30.604
Oh.Okay.

57:31.604 --> 57:32.572
You'll get use to it.

57:32.606 --> 57:34.607
The lighthouse has a way of....

57:34.640 --> 57:36.109
Shining a light on things?

57:36.142 --> 57:38.077
You took the words right outta
my mouth...

57:38.111 --> 57:38.944
As usual.

57:38.979 --> 57:40.915
Well, maybe that's why they call
it...

57:40.948 --> 57:42.016
A light-house!

57:43.383 --> 57:45.453
You're gonna fit right in here.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.388
Hey, whose guitars are these?

57:47.421 --> 57:49.623
They belong to Uncle Fitz and
Daniel.

57:49.656 --> 57:52.693
But they're away having fish and
chips.

57:52.725 --> 57:55.428
She means, on a fishing trip.

57:56.530 --> 57:59.198
When they're in town, we have
a lighthouse jam.

57:59.231 --> 58:00.533
- Oh.
- We sure do.

58:00.566 --> 58:02.335
You'll have to join us sometime.

58:02.368 --> 58:02.970
I'd love it.

58:03.002 --> 58:04.037
Do you play guitar, Kenny?

58:04.071 --> 58:05.506
Oh, I know a chord or two.

58:07.307 --> 58:10.044
Well, Charlie really wants to learn.
Maybe we found him a tutor?

58:10.077 --> 58:11.245
I'd be honored.

58:11.278 --> 58:12.312
Yes.

58:12.345 --> 58:14.080
Hey, Crew! Look what I found!

58:14.381 --> 58:16.083
Yeah.....Woo hoo

58:16.115 --> 58:18.217
Yay!
Will....Patchitt??

58:18.251 --> 58:19.252
Yep! Sure will!!

58:20.220 --> 58:22.455
Lilly,
which lens was not working?

58:22.488 --> 58:25.591
Imagination and power.

58:25.624 --> 58:28.628
That's the sky blue and
the purple lens, Will!

58:28.662 --> 58:29.629
Ha ha!

58:29.662 --> 58:30.463
Wait a minute,

58:30.497 --> 58:32.399
Your telescope has multiple
lenses?

58:32.432 --> 58:34.301
And they change color, too.

58:34.334 --> 58:36.604
The better to see things with,
my dears.

58:37.037 --> 58:38.539
Are they rainbow colors?

58:38.571 --> 58:40.240
Like our beacon?

58:40.272 --> 58:41.242
Twelve, to be exact.

58:41.542 --> 58:42.509
Cool.

58:42.542 --> 58:43.410
Ha ha.

58:43.443 --> 58:44.678
You know...

58:44.711 --> 58:46.747
The colors of the rainbow
are the basic spectrum

58:46.780 --> 58:48.515
From which all the
light we see is composed.

58:48.548 --> 58:49.350
Cool.

58:49.383 --> 58:50.518
And it was the rainbow

58:50.551 --> 58:53.120
That inspired scientists to
further explore the nature

58:53.153 --> 58:54.321
Of color and light.

58:54.354 --> 58:55.723
Drawing the conclusion-

58:55.756 --> 58:57.625
That color is connected to
light.

58:58.325 --> 58:59.426
Glad I asked.

59:00.292 --> 59:01.260
Pretty sharp, huh?

59:01.294 --> 59:02.095
Oh, Yeah.

59:02.127 --> 59:03.696
I thought I was gonna be the
tutor!

59:04.964 --> 59:07.100
So Charlie, let's see what you
got.

59:07.133 --> 59:10.570
Awesome!
Uncle Fitz showed me a C chord.

59:10.604 --> 59:11.605
All right!

59:13.640 --> 59:14.508
Nice.

59:14.540 --> 59:16.343
What's a chord?

59:16.376 --> 59:17.410
A chord is a...

59:17.443 --> 59:20.347
group of notes played together
to form a harmony.

59:20.714 --> 59:21.682
Jinx!!

59:22.716 --> 59:24.551
Two peas in a pod.

59:24.584 --> 59:25.652
Jinx!

59:25.685 --> 59:28.522
Oh, I get it....like the colors
that form a rainbow?

59:28.555 --> 59:31.058
I like the way you think,
Jacara!

59:31.091 --> 59:33.627
If notes were colors,

59:34.461 --> 59:36.729
A group of notes
would form a rainbow!

59:36.763 --> 59:38.065
Ha ha

59:38.097 --> 59:40.066
What colors are those, Mudge?

59:40.100 --> 59:42.603
All shades of green, Crum.

59:45.638 --> 59:49.209
You have a serious problem
with your piping!

59:49.743 --> 59:53.414
I'm sorry, Kenny, meet the
Curmudgeons.

59:53.446 --> 59:54.414
Hi.

59:55.548 --> 59:56.550
Hi.

59:57.017 --> 59:59.252
I should have made 'em pink.

59:59.285 --> 01:00:00.253
Mm hmm.

01:00:01.488 --> 01:00:05.091
Ok... uh... So can I show you a
couple more chords, Charlie?

01:00:05.124 --> 01:00:06.292
You rock, Kenny!

01:00:06.325 --> 01:00:08.261
All right.

01:00:08.294 --> 01:00:08.796
- Yeah! I'll get the maracas!
- Okay, play a C like this.

01:00:08.828 --> 01:00:10.363
I'll get the bongos.

01:00:11.798 --> 01:00:12.366
And then an F.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.769
Okay, try it.

01:00:17.136 --> 01:00:18.071
Heh heh heh

01:00:19.772 --> 01:00:20.740
Perfect. Let's go!

01:00:25.444 --> 01:00:26.847

me!

Tell me again, Charlie, what's a
spark?

01:04:02.428 --> 01:04:06.066
Well, a "spark" is a driving
force in some activity.

01:04:06.098 --> 01:04:09.403
It ignites, animates or
inspires.

01:04:09.435 --> 01:04:10.771
Nice definition.

01:04:10.803 --> 01:04:13.639
So, there could be a spark of
"light" in anything.

01:04:13.673 --> 01:04:16.709
There's a spark of light in
every one of us.

01:04:16.743 --> 01:04:18.545

01:04:18.577 --> 01:04:20.546
