Two weeks ago, an invisible dome

00:04.338 --> 00:06.374

Why did you dO that?
He was about tO give in.

27:31.024 --> 27:34.152
- Signal's getting stronger.
-Joe.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.036
The source is coming
from down there.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.664
You don't have to gO.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.047
It's coming from here.

28:01.221 --> 28:04.179
Joe, don't be frightened.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.260
How about you don't tell him
how tO be?

28:06.935 --> 28:07.970
You're not his girlfriend,

28:08.145 --> 28:10.010
and as far as I know
you're not anyone.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.023
Let's just go.

28:22.284 --> 28:25.071
That locker was the last thing
that she touched.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.486
She died right here.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.950
And maybe
we Should just leave it alone.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.662
I have a bad feeling about this.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.710
GIRL:
Eight.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.464
Seventeen.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.261
One.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.424
[LOCK CLICKS]

29:23.262 --> 29:24.798
It's empty.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.258
Now the signal's gone.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.342
How did you know
that combination?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.931
Who the hell are you?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.035
REBECCA:
All right.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.945
It's Okay. Easy now.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.318
All right.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.527
Are you Okay?

30:28.702 --> 30:30.317
I'm fine.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.698
- Lyle?
- He's in jail.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.539
Trust me, he looks a lot worse
than we dO.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.038
The rain stopped.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.589
I stopped it.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.880
Not the dome. Me.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.715
How?

30:49.890 --> 30:52.222
A mixture Of salination
with some high-pH compounds.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.217
It's pretty science-y.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.057
I thought that stuff
didn't interest you.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.398
- It interests me.
- Good.

31:01.568 --> 31:05.402
Because I tOOk a tour Of the town
after the rain stopped.

31:07.324 --> 31:10.066
Our situation has only gotten worse.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.241
Some tough decisions
need to be made.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.033
What kind Of decisions?

31:18.627 --> 31:19.662
Listen, bitch,

31:19.836 --> 31:22.748
I am SO over this Little Miss Innocent
scam you're running.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.504
And we are not leaving

31:24.674 --> 31:27.416
until you come clean
about how you knew that combination,

31:27.594 --> 31:28.834
and why the Signal got blocked.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.172
I don't know.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.838
What are you, a safecracker?
A magician'S assistant?

31:33.016 --> 31:34.222
Because when we got here

31:34.768 --> 31:37.100
the locker was locked,
and then presto, change-O,

31:37.270 --> 31:38.305
you Opened it right up.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.811
Norrie, she doesn't know.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.223
It wasjust like I saw it in my head.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.064
In your head? In here?

31:46.238 --> 31:48.399
What else is in there?
IS your name in there?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.234
- Norrie, stop.
- NO!

31:50.409 --> 31:52.149
She just Shows up here
without any explanation

31:52.327 --> 31:54.864
on the day your Sister gets killed
in front Of that locker,

31:55.038 --> 31:57.495
and just happens to know
the combination?

31:57.666 --> 31:59.622
How did you know?

31:59.793 --> 32:01.749
- How did you know?
- Leave me alone!

32:01.920 --> 32:04.127
I'm telling the truth.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.084
- Why don't you trust her?
- She just saw it?

32:07.259 --> 32:10.592
That doesn't even make sense.
How do you see a combination?

32:10.762 --> 32:14.846
Actually, I think I might know.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.141
As I've been telling Jim,

32:18.311 --> 32:21.178
we have a serious resource crisis
tO deal with.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.267
I thought that that's what this whole

32:23.442 --> 32:25.307
registration drive
was about in the first place,

32:25.485 --> 32:26.895
is about how tO better allocate
them.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.187
Yes, but it's the lack Of resources
themselves

32:30.365 --> 32:31.480
that I'm most worried about.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.274
Even before today,
there were acute shortages.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.818
And after the rain?

32:35.996 --> 32:37.827
Far fewer medical supplies,

32:37.998 --> 32:39.329
crops destroyed,

32:39.499 --> 32:41.364
a considerable amount Of livestock
decimated,

32:41.543 --> 32:44.285
especially in the pig population.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.998
Day's coming when there won't be
enough food tO sustain us.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.509
SO we Should
have a contingency plan

32:56.683 --> 32:58.548
in case we run out Of Options.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.392
What kind Of contingency plan?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.975
It may become necessary--

33:05.525 --> 33:08.016
Selectively, I'm saying.

33:08.195 --> 33:09.184
--tO thin the herd.

33:10.447 --> 33:12.028
Selectively?

33:24.878 --> 33:26.368
The questions on your form:

33:26.880 --> 33:30.043
family background,
history Of illness.

33:30.217 --> 33:35.507
This is a census to help you decide
who lives and who dies.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.715
Let's get out Of here.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.057

about a contingency.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.664
NO,nO,nO.
I'm not taking anyone's side here.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.578

every possible Option.

You said, "When things fall apart,
people Show their true colors."

34:13.760 --> 34:14.875
Are these yours?

34:15.595 --> 34:17.881
I need tO know that you will stand
with me against them,

34:18.056 --> 34:19.557
against that.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.885

anybody out of the life boat.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.598

- I believe we will find a way.

Long as I remember

34:43.123 --> 34:48.834
The rain '3 been coming down

34:49.004 --> 34:54.465
Clouds of mystery pouring confusion

34:54.634 --> 34:57.296
On the ground

34:58.138 --> 35:01.471
Getting through the ages

35:01.641 --> 35:05.475
Trying to ﬁnd the sun

35:06.688 --> 35:09.475

35:09.649 --> 35:13.141
Who'll stop the rain

35:20.785 --> 35:22.446
I was wondering
when you'd Show up.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.946
Aren't you afraid
Of people seeing us together?

35:27.709 --> 35:29.574
Building's empty.

35:30.712 --> 35:33.169
I could kill you and nobody'd know.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.339
Nobody'd care.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.295
Maybe.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.630
But you won't.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.298
When this thing came down,

35:44.768 --> 35:46.850
I told you to lay low.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.218
Follow my lead.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.307
I got a new leader.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.688
You made a promise,

35:51.858 --> 35:55.976
25 years ago, tO make sure
that what we buried stayed buried.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.853
You've heard Of force majeure,
yeah?

36:01.826 --> 36:06.320
Extraordinary circumstance
that frees both parties from a contract.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.159
But you know what?

36:08.333 --> 36:12.042
This dome is about as majeure a force
as it gets.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.255
But it's gonna deliver us
tO a better place.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.837
I'm afraid you got that
exactly backward, pal.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.966

I read about a tribe in Borneo.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.367
I can't remember
what they're called.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.244
But they had this ritual,

36:48.415 --> 36:50.451
something that they would do
every year.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.368
They'd put all their elderly,
their infirm, up into a tree

36:54.546 --> 36:55.911
and they would Shake it.

36:56.089 --> 36:59.957
And whoever held on
was considered strong enough,

37:00.135 --> 37:02.547
useful enough,
tO make it tO the next year.

37:04.431 --> 37:05.967

37:07.517 --> 37:08.882
LOOk.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.928
the day was coming
we wouldn't have provisions

37:14.107 --> 37:16.644
enough to sustain the population,
that was a bit Of a cheat.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.445
It's now.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.774
The way I calculate it,
we can all starve,

37:25.952 --> 37:27.943
or with proper rationing
and cultivation,

37:28.121 --> 37:30.112
three-quarters of us can survive.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.873
And how do you propose tO do that?

37:34.794 --> 37:36.079
Shake the tree?

37:37.464 --> 37:39.671
You could use the information
we gathered today

37:39.841 --> 37:42.583
tO determine who's an asset
and who's a burden.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.668
Those hard choices could be made,
but not by me.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.089
