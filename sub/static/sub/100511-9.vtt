00:00.500 --> 00:02.480
Previously on When <i>Calls the Heart...</i>

00:02.505 --> 00:05.038
I have the final say over the
operations of this company.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.341
Are you gonna show me the ledger or not?

00:07.777 --> 00:09.092
Emily ran off for something.

00:09.117 --> 00:10.206
I have to go back for her.

00:10.231 --> 00:11.795
No, you stay with the kids in the cabin.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.663
- I'll get Emily.
- I'm scared.

00:13.688 --> 00:14.840
<i>Mrs. Thornton!</i>

00:14.865 --> 00:15.991
<i>Emily!</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:17.016
- Hey!
- Nathan!

00:17.041 --> 00:18.041
What's wrong?

00:18.066 --> 00:19.903
How about today you put
both our lives in danger?

00:19.928 --> 00:21.685
If I hadn't have gotten to
her she might have died.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.108
You both could have died!

00:24.255 --> 00:25.905
<i>We need to get to the infirmary.</i>

00:25.930 --> 00:27.897
<i>It should be me lying in there, not Lee.</i>

00:27.922 --> 00:29.948
Don't say that.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.981
Good morning, Clara.

00:34.095 --> 00:35.647
Have you heard any more about Lee?

00:35.672 --> 00:37.913
Nothing yet. Still waiting.

00:44.843 --> 00:46.210
There you are.

00:46.277 --> 00:48.510
I didn't even hear you
leave this morning.

00:48.546 --> 00:50.062
I had a lot of work to do.

00:50.388 --> 00:51.787
Is there any word?

00:55.936 --> 00:57.892
Bill is serving breakfast.

00:58.090 --> 01:00.187
Maybe you should take a break.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.926
I can't.

01:01.951 --> 01:04.310
We have a big order
shipping out tomorrow.

01:04.334 --> 01:06.984
I just need to make sure
everything goes out right.

01:08.529 --> 01:10.489
I know what you're doing.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.832
I'm working.

01:11.915 --> 01:13.248
It wasn't your fault.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.306
Clara-

01:14.331 --> 01:15.637
It was an accident.

01:15.662 --> 01:17.593
I shouldn't have stayed
out there so long.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.288
If I had just left a little earlier

01:20.313 --> 01:21.711
when the wind started picking up-

01:21.736 --> 01:24.960
Stop. You couldn't have known
that this was going to happen.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.593
Are you sure you don't
want some breakfast?

01:33.636 --> 01:35.253
Maybe later.

01:47.685 --> 01:49.642
You're all more than welcome to stay,

01:49.667 --> 01:51.353
but some of you have been up all night

01:51.378 --> 01:53.135
so you may want to think of going home

01:53.160 --> 01:54.667
and getting some shut eye.

01:54.692 --> 01:56.451
We'll let you know if we hear anything.

01:56.721 --> 01:59.204
Thanks. I'll be opening
the store soon, anyway.

01:59.461 --> 02:01.665
I'm not going anywhere
until we hear something.

02:07.772 --> 02:09.088
Anything?

02:09.740 --> 02:11.008
No.

02:11.877 --> 02:13.969
I can't believe this happened.

02:14.105 --> 02:15.845
Neither can I.

02:17.251 --> 02:18.913
I'd like to bring them some food.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.433
Sure.

02:25.820 --> 02:29.067
Carson, what's happened? Is Lee alright?

02:29.463 --> 02:30.986
See for yourself.

02:33.406 --> 02:34.823
Hi, Elizabeth.

03:04.957 --> 03:09.316
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

03:11.156 --> 03:13.343
You took a really good
rap to the head, Lee,

03:13.368 --> 03:14.868
so you might have a headache

03:14.893 --> 03:16.593
or maybe even some nausea.

03:16.742 --> 03:19.243
Here is an aspirin for the
pain just in case you need it.

03:19.312 --> 03:20.661
Thank you.

03:20.770 --> 03:22.871
How did I hit my head, anyway?

03:24.702 --> 03:27.359
It's quite normal to not
remember what happened

03:27.384 --> 03:29.068
after an accident like that.

03:29.193 --> 03:34.216
Uh, Jesse was stuck up on the
mountain, you went after him.

03:34.302 --> 03:37.044
You were sawing a tree
that had blown over

03:37.135 --> 03:38.929
and the tree fell on you.

03:39.297 --> 03:40.994
- Jesse's OK though, right?
- Yes.

03:41.019 --> 03:42.634
- Good. Good.
- Jesse's fine.

03:42.696 --> 03:44.962
I think it goes without saying
I want you to take it easy

03:44.987 --> 03:46.080
for a couple of weeks.

03:46.105 --> 03:47.838
Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it.

03:49.173 --> 03:50.455
Oh!

03:50.480 --> 03:51.713
Hey!

03:51.871 --> 03:53.971
<i>He looks good.</i>

03:54.218 --> 03:55.987
They've been here all night.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.672
Thank you, everybody.

03:57.697 --> 03:59.398
You gave us quite a scare.

03:59.423 --> 04:00.595
Sorry.

04:00.853 --> 04:02.463
Glad you're up and around, Lee.

04:02.488 --> 04:03.958
Thanks, Henry.

04:05.466 --> 04:06.966
I could get used to this.

04:06.991 --> 04:08.157
Lee.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.556
Thanks, Bill.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.502
Thank you.

04:12.066 --> 04:13.838
<i>Thank you, Bill.</i>

04:36.080 --> 04:37.983
- Oooh.
- Oh, oh, oh.

04:38.063 --> 04:39.781
- There you go.
- Thank you.

04:41.317 --> 04:47.039
Woo, it's good to finally be home.

04:48.225 --> 04:51.376
OK, go ahead. Let's have it.

04:52.086 --> 04:53.503
Have what?

04:54.253 --> 04:55.286
The speech.

04:55.322 --> 04:57.171
<i>About how I put myself in danger,</i>

04:57.196 --> 04:58.841
almost got myself killed,

04:58.866 --> 05:01.135
shouldn't have been out
in the wind storm.

05:01.939 --> 05:03.395
No.

05:03.943 --> 05:08.184
Lee, that speech went
right out the window.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.980
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.739
I'm just so glad to have you home.

05:27.978 --> 05:30.423
_

05:33.723 --> 05:35.571
Is this a bad time?

05:35.968 --> 05:38.381
I was just about to head
to the train station.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.066
You're going somewhere?

05:40.091 --> 05:42.916
No. Mounties are looking for someone.

05:43.020 --> 05:46.140
He got on a train in Union City,
he's heading in this direction.

05:46.415 --> 05:48.517
Red serge would give you away?

05:48.719 --> 05:50.719
That's the idea, yeah.

05:53.931 --> 05:55.607
So what can I help you with?

05:59.937 --> 06:02.072
I was thinking we should talk.

06:02.485 --> 06:03.596
About yesterday.

06:03.621 --> 06:05.328
Yeah, I don't really think
there's much to talk about.

06:05.353 --> 06:06.386
Well, I do.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.732
<i>What was that?</i>

06:10.213 --> 06:12.040
A lot of stuff happened up there, OK?

06:12.065 --> 06:14.403
And if you don't mind that's
just where I'd like to leave it.

06:14.428 --> 06:16.169
That's not what I want.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.174
I have to get to the train station.

06:21.283 --> 06:23.368
You are entitled to feel
whatever it is you're feeling

06:23.393 --> 06:24.792
but please stop shutting me out.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.042
I'm not shutting you out.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.467
Really?

06:30.790 --> 06:32.641
This is clearly about so much more

06:32.666 --> 06:34.901
than just me running after Emily.

06:35.274 --> 06:37.338
I really have to get going, OK? I don't-

06:37.363 --> 06:38.462
Nathan.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.322
Do you wanna know how I ended
up in Union City with Lucas?

06:45.774 --> 06:47.346
How?

06:48.832 --> 06:50.299
He asked.

06:54.368 --> 06:55.958
Be safe.

07:04.473 --> 07:05.773
Gentlemen.

07:05.798 --> 07:07.053
Lucas.

07:07.607 --> 07:09.340
Mike, would you mind giving us a moment?

07:09.365 --> 07:10.690
Sure thing.

07:14.182 --> 07:17.438
I would gather you're here
for the company financials.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.701
It's taking me a little bit
longer to pull it together

07:20.726 --> 07:22.359
than I expected.

07:23.285 --> 07:26.611
Either you're very unorganized
or you're stalling.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.041
My guess is the latter.

07:29.192 --> 07:31.092
<i>I just need to know where we stand.</i>

07:31.225 --> 07:33.997
Our men haven't been paid.
Our bills are behind.

07:34.251 --> 07:36.319
Talking to you won't
speed up the process,

07:36.344 --> 07:37.958
of that I'm certain.

07:38.914 --> 07:40.869
Just don't do anything foolish, Henry.

07:41.056 --> 07:42.604
Such as?

07:42.864 --> 07:44.663
Such as covering your tracks.

07:44.688 --> 07:46.254
Right now this is just a disagreement

07:46.279 --> 07:47.518
between partners.

07:47.650 --> 07:49.049
I don't think either of us want it

07:49.074 --> 07:50.846
to become anything more than that.

08:00.284 --> 08:02.668
You've been awfully quiet
since we got home.

08:02.693 --> 08:04.616
- Oh yeah?
- Mmmhmm.

08:05.212 --> 08:09.532
Well, I guess I'm just
thinking, that's all.

08:09.985 --> 08:13.869
Well, a close call like that

08:16.702 --> 08:18.666
could give you a lot to think about.

08:18.878 --> 08:20.378
I guess you're right.

08:20.547 --> 08:22.836
Puts a lot of things into perspective.

08:23.557 --> 08:25.130
Such as?

08:30.231 --> 08:32.416
I've been very lucky in my life.

08:32.655 --> 08:37.269
You, this town, my career.
Now my health.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.856
Life is a gift, Rosie.

08:42.885 --> 08:45.776
I'd be a fool to live
it with any regrets.

08:50.338 --> 08:52.197
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

08:52.269 --> 08:55.191
I just wanted to say before
we begin how proud I am

08:55.216 --> 08:57.346
of those of you who were in
the wind storm yesterday.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.502
But where's Emily?

08:58.527 --> 09:00.130
Oh, she's just staying home for the day.

09:00.155 --> 09:01.822
We thought it best after yesterday.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.798
- Is she OK?
- Mmmhmm.

09:03.823 --> 09:05.596
She just needed some time.

09:06.090 --> 09:11.970
Now then, we will begin with arithmetic.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.869
<i>Do you think we can still
fill tomorrow's order?</i>

09:14.894 --> 09:16.361
OK, thank you.

09:20.678 --> 09:22.689
Hard at work I see.

09:22.766 --> 09:24.158
Yeah.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.519
I'm sure Lee really appreciates
you holding down the fort

09:26.544 --> 09:27.612
while he's gone.

09:27.757 --> 09:29.174
It's been really busy around here.

09:29.199 --> 09:31.244
You know, you've been
through a lot, too, Jesse.

09:31.365 --> 09:33.491
You don't wanna run yourself too hard.

09:34.402 --> 09:35.952
I'm fine.

09:36.101 --> 09:37.700
It's Lee who got hurt.

09:37.837 --> 09:39.336
That's not what I mean.

09:39.402 --> 09:41.369
It's been a stressful couple of days.

09:41.436 --> 09:43.166
You don't wanna burn yourself out.

09:43.559 --> 09:44.858
I won't.

09:44.939 --> 09:46.295
OK.

09:53.962 --> 09:55.555
What's that?

09:56.215 --> 10:00.060
Oh, just some things I've
kept over the years.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.721
I haven't opened this box
in I don't know how long.

10:04.746 --> 10:07.927
Well, where have you been hiding this?

10:07.952 --> 10:10.252
I snuck it into the attic
when we first moved in.

10:10.335 --> 10:11.568
You.

10:11.593 --> 10:12.988
Aww.

10:13.131 --> 10:15.534
That's me when I was about 10, I think.

10:15.559 --> 10:17.076
Mmm, so handsome.

10:17.101 --> 10:18.911
I don't know about that.

10:19.117 --> 10:21.122
And that's my little brother, Patrick.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.713
He hated getting his photo taken.

10:23.738 --> 10:25.135
My mom had to bribe him with candy

10:25.160 --> 10:27.336
just to get him to sit still.

10:27.766 --> 10:29.518
And what about this pretty little girl?

10:29.543 --> 10:31.229
Is she a cousin?

10:33.054 --> 10:34.635
No.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.679
That's my sister.

10:37.722 --> 10:39.391
Lee.

10:40.545 --> 10:42.560
You don't have a sister.

10:43.224 --> 10:45.104
Yes, Rosemary, I do.

10:48.594 --> 10:50.813
What do you mean, you have a sister?

10:50.838 --> 10:52.569
Her name is Susannah.

10:52.888 --> 10:54.989
She's one year older than I am.

10:56.549 --> 10:59.368
How have I never heard
about this before?

11:00.268 --> 11:05.142
We haven't talked in... years now.

11:05.426 --> 11:07.043
What happened?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.923
Sweetheart.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.762
After Patrick died...

11:20.968 --> 11:23.767
things were just never the same again.

11:25.421 --> 11:30.463
And then my mom passed
and it just got worse.

11:30.706 --> 11:33.440
So much pain and so much anger.

11:33.491 --> 11:37.491
As soon as I turned 18 I left.

11:42.152 --> 11:45.330
I found out a couple years
later that my father had died.

11:52.925 --> 11:55.132
I missed my father's funeral.

12:04.229 --> 12:05.428
<i>Alright, Allie.</i>

12:05.463 --> 12:08.088
What is 21 divided by 7?

12:08.113 --> 12:09.127
3.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.815
Very good.

12:11.283 --> 12:13.283
Excellent work, everyone.

12:13.308 --> 12:14.986
Now go enjoy your recess.

12:22.023 --> 12:24.023
Opal, don't you wanna go outside?

12:24.048 --> 12:26.206
I'm just gonna read my book.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.748
But you love recess.

12:28.895 --> 12:30.968
Don't you wanna go skip
rope with your friends?

12:30.993 --> 12:32.462
Not really.

12:32.997 --> 12:35.655
Is this about what happened
in the wind yesterday?

12:35.829 --> 12:37.829
That was very scary, wasn't it?

12:37.976 --> 12:39.242
You weren't scared?

12:39.319 --> 12:40.517
Yes, I was.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.710
But you were really brave.

12:41.735 --> 12:43.472
The way you went back for Emily.

12:44.549 --> 12:46.476
I don't know about that.

12:46.625 --> 12:51.936
But the important thing is
that we're all safe now.

12:52.055 --> 12:53.621
Mr. Coulter got hurt.

12:53.681 --> 12:57.147
Yes, and that was very
frightening for everyone,

12:57.273 --> 12:59.155
but he's going to be fine.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.367
Is it okay if I read my book in here?

13:03.332 --> 13:04.828
Of course.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.702
Refreshing and real.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.650
A unique and underrepresented voice

13:14.685 --> 13:16.463
that leaves me wanting to read more.

13:16.817 --> 13:18.683
Am I supposed to know what that means?

13:18.708 --> 13:20.041
My mother.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.132
She's a fan.

13:21.157 --> 13:22.702
A fan of what, exactly?

13:22.727 --> 13:24.055
Your work.

13:24.379 --> 13:25.778
And you.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.820
How has she read my work?

13:27.845 --> 13:30.519
I may have sent her a
few of your chapters.

13:30.903 --> 13:34.774
You sent them to your
mother without asking me?

13:35.263 --> 13:37.235
I was worried that you would say no.

13:38.141 --> 13:40.237
All the more reason for you to ask.

13:40.996 --> 13:42.382
They're not ready, Lucas.

13:42.407 --> 13:44.125
I'm still working on them.

13:44.431 --> 13:46.531
She's willing to send
them to a publisher.

13:46.733 --> 13:48.488
She thinks that your
writing is that good.

13:48.513 --> 13:51.763
Lucas, you can't just
take someone's writing

13:51.788 --> 13:53.876
and send it to whomever you please.

13:54.691 --> 13:56.358
I trust her opinion.

13:56.401 --> 13:57.433
Do you trust mine?

13:57.458 --> 13:58.536
Yes, of course.

13:58.561 --> 14:00.554
But that's not the point here.

14:01.011 --> 14:03.426
But this is what you wanted, isn't it?

14:06.305 --> 14:08.357
I guess I shouldn't have
sent it without asking,

14:08.382 --> 14:11.812
but just take a look.

14:12.062 --> 14:13.854
Think about it.

14:21.548 --> 14:22.679
Excuse me.

14:22.704 --> 14:24.343
Is there anywhere I
can grab a quick bite

14:24.368 --> 14:26.468
before the train leaves
for the next station?

14:26.493 --> 14:28.559
Yeah, there's a sandwich shop outside.

14:28.584 --> 14:30.051
Thank you.

14:33.631 --> 14:34.647
Nathan?

14:34.672 --> 14:35.726
Fiona.

14:35.751 --> 14:36.905
Hi.

14:37.411 --> 14:38.491
Welcome back.

14:38.516 --> 14:41.323
Thank you. Are you going on a trip?

14:44.648 --> 14:45.714
Are you alright?

14:45.739 --> 14:47.430
Yeah, um...

14:48.093 --> 14:49.758
Listen, I can't really talk right now.

14:49.783 --> 14:51.725
This is, um, police business.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.782
Oh.

14:52.807 --> 14:55.521
The guy behind me, was he in your train?

14:56.154 --> 14:58.565
Yeah, he got on during one of our stops.

15:02.592 --> 15:03.905
I have to um...

15:04.068 --> 15:06.046
Oh. Say no more.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.450
I'll see you in town.

15:12.850 --> 15:14.873
<i>Well, hello, Constable.</i>

15:19.527 --> 15:21.226
Mounted police.

15:21.397 --> 15:23.382
Elias O'Rourke, you're under arrest.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.192
There you go.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.269
I can't believe he has a sister.

15:36.572 --> 15:38.438
I know.

15:39.621 --> 15:42.088
Well, why hasn't he ever
mentioned her before?

15:42.113 --> 15:45.513
Well, they had a falling out.

15:45.592 --> 15:46.924
Oh, how awful.

15:46.949 --> 15:48.028
Mmmhmm.

15:48.053 --> 15:50.809
I can't imagine not talking
to my sisters for six months

15:50.834 --> 15:52.744
let alone 20 years.

15:52.769 --> 15:55.090
I can't help but feel...

15:55.413 --> 15:59.334
a little hurt he's never
told me about her.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.410
Well, we all know Lee.

16:02.435 --> 16:03.933
For him to have held on to this

16:03.958 --> 16:05.925
it must have been something
very painful for him.

16:06.018 --> 16:07.843
I suppose.

16:08.687 --> 16:12.514
Now he's looking at pictures
of her and thinking of her.

16:13.566 --> 16:16.185
I think this accident
has made him very aware

16:16.210 --> 16:18.144
of how fleeting life can be.

16:18.169 --> 16:19.397
Mmm.

16:19.558 --> 16:21.856
Yesterday did that for all of us.

16:22.358 --> 16:24.651
Opal didn't even wanna go
outside at recess today,

16:24.676 --> 16:26.945
she's so afraid of another storm.

16:28.091 --> 16:29.395
The poor dear.

16:29.483 --> 16:32.284
So much anxiety has been stirred up.

16:32.890 --> 16:35.204
Nathan and I had some words today.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.290
Not pleasant ones I take it?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.336
And then there's Lucas.

16:42.882 --> 16:44.797
What's going on with him?

16:45.606 --> 16:48.551
He sent the first three chapters
of my novel to his mother.

16:48.801 --> 16:50.066
The book editor?

16:50.132 --> 16:53.055
The point is he didn't
ask my permission first.

16:54.483 --> 16:56.058
That was wrong.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.046
But what did she say?

16:58.113 --> 16:59.249
She said she liked them

16:59.274 --> 17:00.945
and she wants to send
them to a publisher.

17:00.970 --> 17:03.554
Elizabeth! This is fantastic!

17:03.579 --> 17:05.443
It is, but...

17:06.142 --> 17:08.153
But what?

17:09.728 --> 17:12.742
But I'm left wondering how
much I can trust him.

17:13.660 --> 17:14.952
Oh.

17:16.127 --> 17:17.954
Well, that's not good.

17:20.010 --> 17:23.954
And the irony is Nathan
seems to be wondering

17:23.980 --> 17:26.172
how much he can trust me.

17:28.152 --> 17:30.717
Well, so suddenly

17:30.742 --> 17:35.513
both of them have gone from
eligible to questionable.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.936
Cookie?

17:44.718 --> 17:46.618
Oh, you're back!

17:48.653 --> 17:50.364
It's so good to see you.

17:50.389 --> 17:52.399
I need to hear all about your honeymoon.

17:52.424 --> 17:53.779
Oh, it couldn't have been better,

17:53.804 --> 17:55.208
but we're glad to be home.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.665
And Jesse's all moved in.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.329
I'm so happy for you two.

17:58.354 --> 18:00.206
Oh, sit, sit.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.849
So what took you to San Francisco?

18:03.298 --> 18:09.715
Oh, family stuff and work.
Nothing exciting.

18:10.253 --> 18:12.686
Well, you must be starving
after that long trip.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.258
I'll get you a plate.

18:14.387 --> 18:16.930
And then I'll fill you in
on everything you missed.

18:19.962 --> 18:21.811
This looks delicious.

18:21.863 --> 18:24.350
Well, I thought you would enjoy
having all your favourites.

18:24.390 --> 18:25.456
Mmmhmm.

18:28.515 --> 18:32.343
Lee, I've been thinking
about your sister-

18:32.491 --> 18:34.532
OK, stop right there.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.713
I'm so sorry.

18:36.738 --> 18:38.970
I should have told you, I
don't know why I didn't-

18:38.995 --> 18:40.729
Lee, there's no need
to keep apologizing.

18:40.759 --> 18:44.210
You had your reasons for not
telling me and I understand.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.002
But now I wanna help.

18:46.271 --> 18:48.211
Do you have any idea where she is?

18:49.122 --> 18:51.291
No.

18:51.316 --> 18:53.280
For all I know is she
could be back in Ohio.

18:53.305 --> 18:55.386
It has been a long time.

18:56.058 --> 18:58.556
The Lee I know doesn't
give up so easily.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.848
<i>What's stopping you from finding her?</i>

19:00.972 --> 19:03.973
You can tell me. I want to help.

19:08.039 --> 19:10.525
Maybe she doesn't want to hear from me.

19:14.584 --> 19:15.740
Well...

19:22.748 --> 19:24.950
*** in General Store.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.234
Oh, good.

19:26.259 --> 19:28.178
<i>My name is Leland Coulter</i>

19:28.203 --> 19:31.129
and, well, I actually grew up
just a few doors down the-

19:31.436 --> 19:33.115
Oh, that's right. That's right.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.810
You remember the Coulters. That's great.

19:34.835 --> 19:36.006
They do!

19:36.031 --> 19:38.568
Um, thank you.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.006
Uh, yes. My mother was
a very sweet lady.

19:42.031 --> 19:43.046
Yes.

19:43.071 --> 19:44.529
Listen, the reason I'm calling is

19:44.554 --> 19:46.811
because I'm trying to
track down my sister,

19:46.899 --> 19:48.303
Susannah Coulter.

19:48.328 --> 19:49.795
And I was just wondering if-

19:50.099 --> 19:52.026
Oh, right.

19:52.302 --> 19:55.028
Uh, well thank you very
much for your time, anyway.

19:55.467 --> 19:56.832
Bye.

19:57.712 --> 19:58.845
What happened?

19:58.911 --> 20:01.743
She moved away shortly
after my father died.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.823
They don't know where she went.

20:03.873 --> 20:06.164
Somebody else is now
living in the house.

20:06.711 --> 20:08.812
Well, don't get discouraged.
We'll find her.

20:08.837 --> 20:11.565
How? I don't even know if her
last name is still Coulter.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.297
She's probably married.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.718
Did she have any suitors
that you remember?

20:17.360 --> 20:18.719
Hmm.

20:20.060 --> 20:22.849
She was seeing this one
fellow, what was his name?

20:23.196 --> 20:25.560
Uh... it's Jake.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.892
But I can't remember his last name.

20:30.036 --> 20:31.773
Maybe it'll come to you.

20:31.948 --> 20:34.281
Yeah, maybe.

20:36.715 --> 20:38.405
Hi, Henry.

20:38.692 --> 20:40.032
Henry?

20:40.682 --> 20:42.651
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.642
You were a million miles away.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.204
I apologize.

20:46.363 --> 20:47.998
Good afternoon.

20:50.643 --> 20:52.043
Bill.

20:52.216 --> 20:53.629
Henry.

20:58.152 --> 20:59.538
What was that all about?

20:59.563 --> 21:00.629
You haven't heard?

21:00.654 --> 21:01.686
Heard what?

21:01.711 --> 21:03.381
It looks like Bouchard and Gowen

21:03.406 --> 21:05.599
may be getting into a legal tangle.

21:05.802 --> 21:07.433
What kind of tangle?

21:07.785 --> 21:10.562
Well, it's not something
I can really talk about.

21:11.522 --> 21:12.690
Have a good day.

21:12.715 --> 21:13.983
You too.

21:19.273 --> 21:21.197
Grub's not bad.

21:21.650 --> 21:24.368
You seem awfully happy for a man
who spent the night in jail.

21:24.393 --> 21:27.579
You know, I believe in
the justice system.

21:27.835 --> 21:29.321
Listen, I hate to break it to you

21:29.346 --> 21:31.678
but the justice system doesn't
really work in your favour

21:31.703 --> 21:33.044
if you're guilty.

21:33.216 --> 21:35.216
Can I help it if I was born with a gift?

21:35.306 --> 21:38.106
If only your gift was carpentry
instead of safe cracking

21:38.563 --> 21:40.976
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

21:42.446 --> 21:45.180
Well, tell the guys they
did great yesterday.

21:45.205 --> 21:46.354
Yeah.

21:48.677 --> 21:49.977
He actually just walked in.

21:50.002 --> 21:51.486
I'll talk to you later.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.844
Was that the mill?

21:53.028 --> 21:55.938
Yeah. Uh, shouldn't you
be at home resting?

21:55.963 --> 21:57.796
Oh, don't you start with me now.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.483
Look, I'm meeting Rosemary in a minute

21:59.508 --> 22:01.473
I just wanted to swing
by here and let you know

22:01.498 --> 22:03.114
I'm gonna be another couple of days.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.452
Does that mean you're not OK?

22:05.477 --> 22:06.836
That's not what I said.

22:06.861 --> 22:08.274
I just need another couple of days

22:08.299 --> 22:10.247
of rest and relaxation, that's all.

22:10.347 --> 22:11.665
You sure?

22:12.200 --> 22:14.835
Jesse, what's it gonna
take to convince you?

22:16.412 --> 22:21.015
It's just... when I saw you
lying there on the ground

22:21.112 --> 22:22.212
for a minute I thought that-

22:22.237 --> 22:24.887
I know. I know.

22:25.140 --> 22:27.765
And I'm here, and I'm fine.

22:28.324 --> 22:29.517
I'm sorry, Lee.

22:29.735 --> 22:31.462
The only reason you were
up on that mountain

22:31.487 --> 22:32.891
was because you were looking for me.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.835
The only reason you were
up on that mountain

22:34.860 --> 22:36.397
is because I sent you there.

22:37.246 --> 22:39.013
Nobody blames you, Jesse.

22:39.038 --> 22:40.383
Least of all me.

22:40.408 --> 22:42.403
You're like a brother to me, Lee.

22:47.376 --> 22:48.702
Thank you.

22:48.979 --> 22:51.580
That means more than you
could possibly know.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.282
Now, as your brother,

22:54.307 --> 22:56.209
there is something I
need you to do for me.

22:56.459 --> 22:57.835
Anything.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.963
Let it go.

23:00.948 --> 23:02.632
- OK.
- Good.

23:04.171 --> 23:07.329
Yeah. Uh, you know, the
guys, they've been uh,

23:07.354 --> 23:08.805
going all out for you up at the mill.

23:08.830 --> 23:09.863
Happy to hear it.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.268
Actually, the sawyers beat
their best day yesterday.

23:14.297 --> 23:15.479
Tom.

23:15.776 --> 23:17.064
Sorry?

23:17.208 --> 23:18.392
That's it.

23:18.417 --> 23:20.485
Uh, I'll be back in a couple of days.

23:20.510 --> 23:22.277
You're doing great.

23:24.972 --> 23:27.399
Rosemary, you know, I've been wondering

23:27.424 --> 23:29.805
what that call Lee had me
place to Loveland, Ohio,

23:29.830 --> 23:30.907
was all about.

23:30.932 --> 23:33.126
Oh, uh, well...

23:34.071 --> 23:36.238
We're looking for his sister.

23:36.263 --> 23:38.130
The two of them have lost touch.

23:38.216 --> 23:39.585
Oh.

23:39.610 --> 23:40.936
- Rosie.
- Oh.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.215
- Hi, Fiona.
- Hi.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.602
- I think I remember his name.
- Oh.

23:43.627 --> 23:46.173
It's Jake Tom, as in Tom Sawyer.

23:46.198 --> 23:47.922
Only it's spelled Thom.

23:47.947 --> 23:50.932
Alright, so her name
could be Susannah Thom.

23:50.957 --> 23:52.265
Yes.

23:52.506 --> 23:53.771
Anything else?

23:53.796 --> 23:55.730
I think he was from Olympia.

23:55.755 --> 23:57.251
Olympia, Washington?

23:57.276 --> 23:58.719
Yeah. He was a really good athlete.

23:58.744 --> 24:01.657
My dad used to say he was
the Olympian from Olympia.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.401
Well, that's a good place to start.

24:04.457 --> 24:05.820
Where are you going?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.655
To ask the exchange in
Olympia, Washington,

24:07.680 --> 24:09.532
to check their listings.

24:10.634 --> 24:12.369
It's worth a shot.

24:13.390 --> 24:15.291
Enjoy your recess, everyone.

24:24.301 --> 24:26.166
Opal. Come play with us.

24:26.249 --> 24:27.802
No, it's okay.

24:38.468 --> 24:40.940
I'd like to stay inside, please.

24:41.396 --> 24:44.150
Don't you wish you were outside
playing with your friends?

24:44.393 --> 24:48.429
Kind of, but it's OK.
Emily's not here, anyway.

24:48.495 --> 24:49.661
Hmm.

24:49.715 --> 24:52.826
Well, I hope she will be back soon.

24:54.725 --> 24:57.748
Opal, what exactly are you afraid of?

24:59.622 --> 25:01.518
I think you're imagining all the things

25:01.543 --> 25:04.170
that could possibly go
wrong if you go outside.

25:04.914 --> 25:06.214
But if you do that,

25:06.239 --> 25:09.422
you'll spend your whole life
hiding from everything.

25:09.712 --> 25:11.803
That can't be very much fun.

25:13.695 --> 25:15.661
You know, it can actually
make you feel good

25:15.686 --> 25:18.268
to face your fears and overcome them.

25:20.310 --> 25:24.899
What about you and I try
going outside together?

25:31.321 --> 25:33.200
Atta girl.

25:44.567 --> 25:46.128
Elizabeth.

25:47.294 --> 25:49.466
About those chapters.

25:49.970 --> 25:52.135
I'm really very sorry.

25:52.591 --> 25:54.366
I see now that sending them

25:54.401 --> 25:56.723
should have been completely your choice.

25:56.839 --> 25:59.643
I suppose your heart was
in the right place.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.685
Still, I was very much out of line.

26:02.788 --> 26:07.484
In the future please just...
just ask me first.

26:07.670 --> 26:09.945
Believe me, I've learned my lesson.

26:20.572 --> 26:22.405
Bill told me there's trouble.

26:22.466 --> 26:23.935
Is it serious?

26:24.018 --> 26:26.086
It's becoming so.

26:26.664 --> 26:29.162
Henry's refusing to
show me the accounts.

26:29.318 --> 26:31.179
Lucas, you've been partners
in Gowan Petroleum

26:31.204 --> 26:32.904
for over a year now.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.553
You don't trust Henry?

26:35.483 --> 26:37.150
I wish I could.

26:37.355 --> 26:39.402
But the longer he refuses
to show me the books

26:39.427 --> 26:41.117
the more reason I have to suspect

26:41.142 --> 26:42.601
that he's hiding something.

26:51.951 --> 26:53.947
To what do I owe the pleasure?

26:54.456 --> 26:56.463
Henry, forgive me for prying

26:56.488 --> 27:00.161
but I hear things aren't going so well.

27:00.446 --> 27:02.748
It's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

27:03.569 --> 27:05.291
Lucas is concerned.

27:05.459 --> 27:07.084
Well, he needn't be, either.

27:07.109 --> 27:08.628
Henry.

27:09.308 --> 27:10.941
He put you up to this?

27:11.063 --> 27:14.130
Lucas may have spoken to
me but I can assure you

27:14.155 --> 27:17.095
whatever you share with
me will stay between us.

27:19.515 --> 27:22.355
Well, I made a mess of things.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.185
That's the long and short of it.

27:24.437 --> 27:25.863
I thought that I was a mile ahead

27:25.888 --> 27:28.315
but clearly I was a mile behind.

27:28.742 --> 27:30.566
How bad is it?

27:32.383 --> 27:35.530
I haven't taken a salary
in quite some time.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.908
And now I can't afford to pay the men.

27:38.278 --> 27:42.221
And I keep hoping that the next
big shipment will help us out

27:42.246 --> 27:44.519
but then I get hit with something else,

27:44.544 --> 27:46.792
whether it's rig repairs

27:46.817 --> 27:49.584
or a drop in oil price or
a rise in freight costs.

27:49.609 --> 27:53.175
Henry, you don't have
to face this alone.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.551
This is on me and I will
find a way out of it.

27:57.239 --> 27:59.555
Why are you making this so personal?

28:01.669 --> 28:05.602
In my life people have feared me,

28:06.350 --> 28:11.358
hated me, scorned me,
not without reason.

28:13.898 --> 28:19.490
But since I discovered oil
they've respected me.

28:21.758 --> 28:24.015
Gowen Petroleum is the only
thing I have done in my life

28:24.040 --> 28:26.832
that I think I've ever been proud of.

28:27.689 --> 28:31.670
Henry, you have so much
more to be proud of.

28:32.689 --> 28:36.549
You have friends, including Lucas.

28:36.831 --> 28:39.426
Why don't you just tell
him what you told me?

28:41.328 --> 28:43.039
It's my mess.

28:45.699 --> 28:48.145
Maybe he could help
you clean it up then.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.487
I got a new case for you, Bill.

28:59.842 --> 29:01.696
Ah, you nabbed him.

29:01.769 --> 29:02.834
Well done.

29:02.859 --> 29:03.925
Elias O'Rourke.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.483
Hails from Buxton.

29:05.508 --> 29:07.581
Should be pretty cut and dry
from what I understand.

29:07.606 --> 29:08.623
Good.

29:08.648 --> 29:09.923
My schedule's a little tight.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.649
I have a hearing in
Hope Valley Wednesday.

29:12.674 --> 29:14.046
Let's aim for that.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.516
Great. Good.

29:15.541 --> 29:18.475
I'll just enjoy his charming
company until then.

29:18.658 --> 29:19.958
How's Lee doing, by the way?

29:19.983 --> 29:21.807
He's good. He's up and about.

29:21.832 --> 29:23.711
That's good. That's good.

29:23.736 --> 29:25.282
Could have been a lot worse for him.

29:25.310 --> 29:26.609
And a few others.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.251
Like who?

29:29.703 --> 29:31.625
Uh, just um...

29:31.710 --> 29:34.411
Elizabeth and the kids also
got caught in the storm.

29:34.487 --> 29:37.694
She um, she kind of put
herself in the thick of it.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.703
What do you mean?

29:39.871 --> 29:42.949
She took a personal risk trying
to save one of her students.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.013
I don't know.

29:46.167 --> 29:48.034
Sounds like something she'd do.

29:48.076 --> 29:49.415
Was it a problem?

29:49.440 --> 29:51.974
No, but it could have been.

29:52.173 --> 29:53.573
Nathan.

29:53.687 --> 29:55.687
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you

29:55.763 --> 29:57.663
but Elizabeth's tougher than she looks.

29:57.706 --> 29:59.338
She's been through a lot.

29:59.437 --> 30:02.385
It's taught her to
look before she leaps.

30:03.583 --> 30:05.679
Are we still talking
about the storm here?

30:06.289 --> 30:08.182
I don't think so.

30:10.653 --> 30:11.894
Thanks.

30:18.285 --> 30:20.219
How long are you staying in Hope Valley?

30:20.371 --> 30:21.905
I'm just passing through.

30:22.134 --> 30:23.667
It seems like a nice town, though.

30:23.692 --> 30:24.908
It is.

30:25.182 --> 30:26.243
Afternoon.

30:26.268 --> 30:27.828
Afternoon.

30:29.092 --> 30:30.204
<i>The usual?</i>

30:30.229 --> 30:32.081
Nothing for me, thanks.

30:32.756 --> 30:34.751
I just wanted to check.

30:35.021 --> 30:36.919
Has Gowen produced those books yet?

30:37.414 --> 30:38.680
No.

30:38.705 --> 30:40.907
You let me know when you
wanna sign that subpoena.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.008
Thanks, Judge.

30:42.033 --> 30:44.332
<i>I just think I'm gonna
wait a little longer.</i>

30:44.641 --> 30:46.207
<i>You're taking a chance here.</i>

30:46.232 --> 30:48.222
The longer you wait the
more he's gonna be tempted

30:48.247 --> 30:49.808
<i>to find a way out of this.</i>

30:49.971 --> 30:51.935
He has some people who believe in him.

30:52.402 --> 30:53.769
Really?

30:54.579 --> 30:57.023
I guess we're talking about Elizabeth?

30:58.897 --> 31:00.778
I trust her judgement.

31:01.905 --> 31:03.113
OK.

31:08.258 --> 31:09.462
Woah.

31:09.487 --> 31:12.041
There you go. There you go.

31:12.066 --> 31:14.019
What do you think? One more?

31:14.044 --> 31:16.080
I thought you were
supposed to be resting.

31:16.105 --> 31:18.473
Well, Laura said he had an
extra long nap so I was-

31:18.498 --> 31:19.564
we are just playing.

31:19.589 --> 31:20.813
I was talking about you.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.341
Oh. Me?

31:22.366 --> 31:24.087
Oh, I'm fine.

31:24.419 --> 31:25.918
There you go.

31:25.943 --> 31:27.159
Oh, almost!

31:27.184 --> 31:29.585
So how is the search
for your sister going?

31:29.610 --> 31:31.127
Well, I was just telling Jack here

31:31.152 --> 31:33.873
that I feel really good
about it, actually.

31:33.898 --> 31:36.232
Oh, that's wonderful!

31:36.257 --> 31:37.272
Oh.

31:37.301 --> 31:38.534
Yeah.

31:38.559 --> 31:39.691
Where's the ball?

31:39.716 --> 31:42.377
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

31:42.402 --> 31:45.406
<i>Lee, I think it's time
for you to have a rest.</i>

31:45.431 --> 31:47.220
How about just ten more minutes, huh?

31:47.245 --> 31:50.284
You are incorrigible.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.869
Elizabeth.

31:52.193 --> 31:53.459
Are you alright with him?

31:53.492 --> 31:55.104
Oh yeah, of course. We're
having a great time.

31:55.129 --> 31:56.333
- OK.
- You guys go ahead.

31:56.358 --> 31:57.758
OK. I'll see you soon, sweetheart.

31:57.783 --> 31:58.846
OK, see you guys.

31:58.871 --> 32:00.003
Bye.

32:00.028 --> 32:01.046
Here.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.464
You ready for the big kick?

32:25.766 --> 32:28.067
<i>What if we never find her?</i>

32:28.236 --> 32:31.284
Naturally, I'm encouraging Lee,

32:31.338 --> 32:34.470
but he's really getting his hopes up.

32:34.834 --> 32:37.581
Well, it is a risk well worth taking.

32:37.606 --> 32:39.418
I suppose.

32:39.941 --> 32:42.921
Oh, what did you decide
to do about your novel?

32:43.652 --> 32:45.118
Nothing yet.

32:45.143 --> 32:47.424
Oh. Still haven't forgiven Lucas?

32:47.449 --> 32:49.718
No, I have. I just...

32:51.601 --> 32:53.728
I remember how awful
it felt the last time

32:53.753 --> 32:55.361
my short stories were rejected and-

32:55.386 --> 32:56.994
and I'm not quite sure

32:57.019 --> 32:58.811
I'm ready to put myself
through that again.

32:58.836 --> 33:02.607
Sounds to me like another
risk well worth taking.

33:03.809 --> 33:05.643
It's not the same.

33:05.668 --> 33:07.112
Isn't it?

33:10.598 --> 33:12.075
Hold on. We're coming.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.620
We're coming. We're coming.

33:13.645 --> 33:15.013
Here we go. Here we go.

33:15.038 --> 33:16.287
Oh, and down we go.

33:16.312 --> 33:17.812
OK.

33:17.837 --> 33:18.888
Hello?

33:18.913 --> 33:20.995
I have a number for you
in Washington state.

33:21.020 --> 33:23.420
It's Bellingham 2442.

33:23.445 --> 33:26.255
<i>It only took me 18 tries to find her.</i>

33:26.442 --> 33:27.876
<i>Lee? Are you there?</i>

33:27.901 --> 33:29.734
Yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here.

33:29.867 --> 33:30.999
Thank you, Fiona.

33:31.024 --> 33:33.117
That's... that's great. You're amazing.

33:33.142 --> 33:35.389
Just call back when you're
ready for me or Florence

33:35.414 --> 33:36.913
to place the call.

33:43.614 --> 33:45.357
Hope Valley Central.

33:45.713 --> 33:47.818
Yes, this is Fiona Miller.

33:48.811 --> 33:50.738
Hello, Mr. Nichols.

33:55.090 --> 33:57.371
I understand, but...

34:02.925 --> 34:05.086
I do like my job.

34:15.030 --> 34:16.530
OK.

34:22.177 --> 34:23.576
Fiona, hi.

34:23.601 --> 34:27.773
Um... could you place that
call for me now, please?

34:28.009 --> 34:29.652
Right away, Lee.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.034
Hello?

34:38.922 --> 34:40.222
Susannah?

34:40.246 --> 34:41.380
Yes?

34:44.678 --> 34:46.210
It's me.

34:46.672 --> 34:47.835
<i>Lee.</i>

34:56.279 --> 34:57.971
What happened?

34:58.880 --> 35:00.308
She hung up.

35:00.748 --> 35:02.046
No.

35:02.246 --> 35:03.546
I'm sure it's a bad connection.

35:03.571 --> 35:04.896
Rosie.

35:05.998 --> 35:07.566
It's not the connection.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.492
I know.

35:23.863 --> 35:25.430
I'm alright.

35:27.602 --> 35:29.133
Hi, Carson.

35:29.158 --> 35:32.444
Fiona, is Florence OK?

35:32.469 --> 35:34.259
Yeah, she'll be fine.

35:42.418 --> 35:43.613
Florence?

35:43.638 --> 35:44.952
Are you alright?

35:44.977 --> 35:48.940
Oh... I suppose you haven't heard?

35:49.513 --> 35:50.900
<i>Fiona!</i>

35:52.693 --> 35:54.779
Florence told me you're leaving?

35:55.035 --> 35:57.769
Yeah. I'm-I'm being transferred
to Powell Springs.

35:58.048 --> 35:59.381
Did you put in for this?

35:59.502 --> 36:01.703
No. In fact, I tried to get out of it

36:01.728 --> 36:04.455
but I found out today
they won't let me, so...

36:05.456 --> 36:06.685
How soon?

36:06.710 --> 36:08.042
Next week.

36:09.887 --> 36:11.920
Have a good night.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.589
You too.

36:30.487 --> 36:33.643
Lee. Please come inside.

36:33.668 --> 36:35.078
Yeah, in a minute.

36:38.639 --> 36:39.991
Look.

36:41.109 --> 36:42.542
You tried.

36:42.608 --> 36:44.078
That's all you could do.

36:44.566 --> 36:46.334
It's up to her to make the next move.

36:46.359 --> 36:47.731
You don't understand, Rosemary.

36:47.756 --> 36:49.710
What don't I understand?

36:49.823 --> 36:51.357
It's too late.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.975
It's too late. We're like
strangers to each other.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.421
I don't believe for one second
that you think it's too late,

36:56.446 --> 37:00.511
and if she does then she's
the one who's losing out.

37:01.387 --> 37:04.684
I told Elizabeth I would
stay with little Jack

37:04.709 --> 37:06.016
for a few minutes.

37:06.271 --> 37:08.979
When I come back we'll
talk about this some more.

37:09.161 --> 37:10.605
OK.

37:13.701 --> 37:15.484
I love you, Lee Coulter.

37:16.019 --> 37:17.618
I love you, too.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.374
Here you are, gentlemen.

37:32.719 --> 37:36.172
Well, there's nine more
where these came from.

37:36.442 --> 37:37.798
Happy?

37:37.823 --> 37:39.675
I am happy you've seen reason.

37:39.861 --> 37:41.803
Is that what I've seen?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.033
Hi.

38:03.380 --> 38:04.613
Hi.

38:04.744 --> 38:05.952
Are those...?

38:06.330 --> 38:07.410
Yes.

38:07.477 --> 38:08.662
Just got them.

38:08.974 --> 38:10.072
I can come back.

38:10.097 --> 38:13.500
No, no, no, no. Please, have a seat.

38:19.192 --> 38:21.176
I came to say yes.

38:22.235 --> 38:23.467
Yes?

38:25.340 --> 38:27.182
To go publisher.

38:27.843 --> 38:29.660
Of course, yes!

38:29.816 --> 38:30.883
This is such a good idea.

38:30.908 --> 38:32.770
You are not gonna regret this.

38:32.795 --> 38:34.199
<i>You'll see.</i>

38:41.053 --> 38:45.491
Florence, can you um, connect
me to Bellingham 2442 please?

38:46.075 --> 38:47.952
Connecting you now, Lee.

38:54.549 --> 38:55.581
Hello?

38:55.606 --> 38:57.212
<i>Susannah, please don't hang up.</i>

38:57.237 --> 38:59.046
I have to come see you.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.881
We have to talk.

39:01.602 --> 39:03.969
Whatever has happened between us,

39:03.994 --> 39:05.553
<i>we're still family.</i>

39:06.564 --> 39:08.848
I'm going to have to think
about this, Leland.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.851
I understand.

39:33.513 --> 39:34.707
Hi.

39:35.454 --> 39:37.167
Hi.

39:38.487 --> 39:40.588
Um, I'm sorry to bother you so late.

39:41.153 --> 39:42.251
It's alright.

39:42.412 --> 39:44.008
Little Jack just fell asleep.

39:46.997 --> 39:48.763
Would you like to come in?

39:51.282 --> 39:52.600
Thanks.

40:00.329 --> 40:04.460
I feel like um... about the other night,

40:04.485 --> 40:07.322
I owe you an apology.

40:09.414 --> 40:12.078
I overreacted about a few things.

40:14.198 --> 40:19.001
Nathan, the last thing I
want is to hurt anyone.

40:20.866 --> 40:23.923
And I can see how things
looked from your perspective.

40:25.243 --> 40:27.176
You mean in the woods.

40:28.865 --> 40:30.442
That too.

40:34.431 --> 40:37.165
I just-I wanted to let you know
that I appreciate your courage.

40:37.273 --> 40:39.813
Going out there after Emily.

40:40.835 --> 40:42.858
You followed your instincts.

40:43.299 --> 40:48.363
And if you can't do that
then you're in real trouble.

40:49.991 --> 40:53.745
I guess I'm just following
my instincts then.

40:55.222 --> 40:57.749
About what?

40:59.325 --> 41:01.002
Everything.

41:06.217 --> 41:08.300
Elizabeth, I um...

41:09.450 --> 41:15.390
I just want you to be safe because...

41:17.866 --> 41:19.853
Because you matter to me.

41:25.502 --> 41:26.903
Goodnight.

41:32.586 --> 41:33.951
Goodnight.
