Okay, go! Lets go!

02:48.707 --> 02:50.335
Red light.

02:50.410 --> 02:51.900
Green light.

03:02.589 --> 03:04.751
Did you hear that?

03:04.825 --> 03:08.055
It came from over there.

03:10.597 --> 03:13.761
Locked.

03:17.505 --> 03:19.096
Freeze!

03:19.172 --> 03:22.040
Oh, hi, fellas.

03:32.119 --> 03:33.381
Hi.

03:33.454 --> 03:36.322
Ernest, how many times
do I have to tell you

03:36.391 --> 03:37.790
about bank procedure?

03:39.261 --> 03:40.694
Do you realize
you could've caused

03:40.762 --> 03:43.458
a serious accident here,
perhaps even a blood bath?

03:44.833 --> 03:47.859
This man is a coiled cobra
ready to strike

03:47.936 --> 03:49.335
at the slightest
irregularity.

03:49.404 --> 03:51.270
I'm sorry, fellas.

03:51.341 --> 03:53.934
I-I just got to workin' on
this old polisher switch,

03:54.009 --> 03:55.943
and I just forgot.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.479
<i>Okay.</i>

03:58.547 --> 04:00.038
I'm gonna
let you off this time

04:00.116 --> 04:02.346
because you're one of us
and you work at the bank.

04:02.418 --> 04:04.682
Yeah.

04:04.754 --> 04:07.052
But I won't always have
this job.

04:07.123 --> 04:11.719
Someday I'll be able to wield
the financial muscle

04:11.794 --> 04:13.056
of this institution.

04:13.129 --> 04:15.064
I'll be able to
move assets around

04:15.132 --> 04:18.156
like chessmen
on a financial chessboard.

04:18.233 --> 04:22.262
Someday corporate managers will
shudder in their wingtips

04:22.339 --> 04:26.435
at my approach,
for I will be... a bank clerk.

04:26.510 --> 04:28.102
Aah!

04:31.682 --> 04:33.274

04:43.027 --> 04:44.494
Bob, I'm sick of this
police band.

04:44.561 --> 04:46.530
Lets listen to something
with kick to it!

04:47.932 --> 04:49.194
Yeah!

04:49.267 --> 04:50.666
Help! Chuck!

04:50.735 --> 04:52.635

04:54.539 --> 04:55.539

04:59.744 --> 05:02.873

05:19.231 --> 05:20.391
<i>Whoa!</i>

05:20.466 --> 05:24.961

07:18.355 --> 07:19.823
What?

07:19.891 --> 07:20.891
Uh!

07:22.727 --> 07:24.319
<i>My hands are stuck!
I'm doomed!</i>

07:26.330 --> 07:27.330
Aah!

07:35.942 --> 07:37.738
Security check five.

07:37.809 --> 07:38.935
No problem.

07:44.183 --> 07:46.981
<i>Man: There has been a breach
in security.</i>

07:47.053 --> 07:50.022
<i>All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.</i>

07:55.561 --> 07:57.324
Hey, you!

08:09.877 --> 08:12.573
Mr. Nash,
you got to help me.

08:12.646 --> 08:14.409
I just killed a guy.

08:16.116 --> 08:17.913
What about it?
You got to help me!

08:21.589 --> 08:23.819
I help no one who
can't help me.

08:23.892 --> 08:25.756
<i>Its your mess, Rubin.</i>

08:25.826 --> 08:27.316
You clean it up.

08:27.394 --> 08:29.625
Mr. Nash, you...

08:29.697 --> 08:31.130
you got to do something!

08:32.734 --> 08:34.224
<i>Help me!</i>

08:40.140 --> 08:41.972
Good morning, Frank.

08:51.854 --> 08:53.287
Morning, Chuck.

08:53.355 --> 08:55.687
Did you have a problem
last night?

08:55.758 --> 08:58.192
N-Nothing we couldn't handle.

08:58.260 --> 09:00.125
Oh.

09:00.996 --> 09:03.055
Not again today.

09:03.132 --> 09:06.329
You might as well go ahead and, uh, show
him some kind of I.D., Miss Sparrow.

09:06.402 --> 09:07.893
I have to,
and I'm his brother.

09:21.117 --> 09:24.609
What in the Sam Hill
do you think you're doin'?

09:28.325 --> 09:29.758
Ernest?

09:29.826 --> 09:30.987
Ernest!

09:31.062 --> 09:31.994
Oh.

09:32.063 --> 09:33.462
What happened?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.192
Uh... uh, I-I was just
guardin' the money...

09:36.266 --> 09:39.998
you know, bein' extra careful,
uh, walkin' that extra mile.

09:40.071 --> 09:42.437
Ernest, this is the biggest
mess you've ever made.

09:42.506 --> 09:44.098
If Mr. Pendlesmythe
sees this...

09:44.175 --> 09:45.301
It wasn't my fault.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.469
They followed me in here.
It was awful.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.809
You can't imagine...
especially these two.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.476
Ernest, whatever happened, you've got to
clean it up now. Come on. I'll help you.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.611
Did you read those books
that I gave you?

09:55.687 --> 09:58.622
<i>I tried, but
they were real tough.</i>

09:58.690 --> 10:02.421
There weren't any pictures,
and the print was real small.

10:02.494 --> 10:05.429
Ernest, you've got to work hard
if you want to get ahead.

10:05.497 --> 10:07.829
I know,
but I get discouraged.

10:07.899 --> 10:11.858
And besides, Mr. Pendlesmythe's
not gonna give me a chance.

10:11.937 --> 10:14.770
Ernest, you got to
believe in yourself.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.106
Y-You've got to have
faith in the system.

10:18.177 --> 10:21.271
You're right, Charlotte.

10:21.347 --> 10:24.316
After all,
I am Ernest P. Worrell,

10:24.384 --> 10:27.785
an upwardly mobile American
at his best,

10:27.854 --> 10:30.755
and I know that
if I pay my taxes, bathe,

10:30.823 --> 10:32.257
and floss regularly,

10:32.326 --> 10:36.625
I will ascend the ladder
of success, hand over foot.

10:36.696 --> 10:39.860
Ernest, do you think
the floor needs a polish?

10:43.170 --> 10:45.035
Come on. Walk this way.
Come on.

10:45.105 --> 10:47.869
Two minutes for me,
man.

10:52.413 --> 10:54.608
<i>Man:
Attention to cellblock...</i>

10:54.681 --> 10:58.117
<i>exercise time is over
in five minutes.</i>

11:02.322 --> 11:04.587
Today's your deadline,
Eddie.

11:04.659 --> 11:06.991
I want that money
you owe me.

11:07.062 --> 11:09.155
I'm sorry, Mr. Nash.

11:09.230 --> 11:10.891
I just need
a little more time.

11:10.965 --> 11:12.125
<i>Not good enough,
Eddie.</i>

11:12.200 --> 11:13.724
<i>Lyle...</i>

11:13.802 --> 11:16.737
<i>See if you can help Eddie
with his attitude.</i>

11:20.443 --> 11:22.672
I'll get it for you.
I swear.

11:22.744 --> 11:24.109
<i>Oh, I know that, Eddie.</i>

11:24.179 --> 11:26.080
<i>The question is when.</i>

11:26.148 --> 11:29.379
Tomorrow...
I'll get it for you tomorrow.

11:29.452 --> 11:33.479
Today's your deadline.
I hate to encourage tardiness.

11:36.592 --> 11:40.187
Please...
I'll get it for you tonight.

11:40.262 --> 11:41.525
I swear.

11:41.598 --> 11:43.395
<i>See that you do, Eddie.</i>

11:43.467 --> 11:45.957
See that you do.

11:52.976 --> 11:55.240
There.
All cleaned up.

11:55.312 --> 11:57.803
That should pass
Mr. Pendlesmythe's inspection.

11:57.881 --> 11:59.644
Right you are, Charlotte.

11:59.716 --> 12:03.345
And Mr. Poodlesmurf is lucky
to have me on his team.

12:03.420 --> 12:06.117
As a matter of fact,
one of these days,

12:06.190 --> 12:10.455
I'm gonna walk into that
office, and I'm gonna say...

12:11.528 --> 12:13.929
- "Oscar, babe..."
- What?

12:13.998 --> 12:15.898
Uh, good morning,
Mr. Puddlesmoot...

12:15.967 --> 12:17.935
Smiddlepit...
Smooglepoot...

12:18.002 --> 12:19.732
Pendlesmythe,
you idiot!

12:19.805 --> 12:21.669
Uh, yes, sir.

12:23.541 --> 12:26.806
Can't you get anything
right?

12:26.878 --> 12:28.938
Why are you
such a screw-up?

12:35.086 --> 12:37.555
Ernest, you've got to be
more careful.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.523
I know.

12:39.591 --> 12:41.752
I'll never get to be
a clerk.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.318
I'll be lucky if they let me
stay on as a janitor,

12:44.396 --> 12:45.658
know what I mean?

12:45.731 --> 12:47.926
<i>Hey, maybe I can help you
with that promotion.</i>

12:48.000 --> 12:50.834
All you need is a little
more self-confidence.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.601
You're right, Charlotte. I
need to think more positive.

12:54.674 --> 12:58.268
I need to think...
I'll get that job.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.780
Why, that man is putty
in my fingers.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.873
I'm just toyin' with him
now,

13:03.950 --> 13:06.044
like a kitten
with a June bug.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.814
I was just thinking
that, uh,

13:07.887 --> 13:09.565
<i>Yeah, like a... - since
you're not working tomorrow</i>

13:09.589 --> 13:10.886
that maybe we could get
together,

13:10.957 --> 13:12.822
talk about the job,
maybe have dinner.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.828
Dinner?

13:15.896 --> 13:18.990
Did you say "dinner"...
like just the two of us

13:19.066 --> 13:21.557
in the same town on the same
day in the same restaurant,

13:21.635 --> 13:23.227
possibly
at the same table?

13:23.304 --> 13:26.034
Well, yes, but...
just as friends, right?

13:26.106 --> 13:29.474
I mean just as friends. I mean, we'll
get together, we'll talk about the job.

13:29.544 --> 13:31.033
<i>I can give you
some, uh, insights</i>

13:31.111 --> 13:32.635
based upon my experience.

13:32.713 --> 13:34.112
Experience.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.773
Oh, yeah.

13:35.849 --> 13:39.047
Well, I suggest you bring
your willpower, young woman.

13:39.120 --> 13:43.215
<i>Be forewarned... the
Worrell charm is merciless.</i>

13:49.297 --> 13:51.731
Oh, sure, Charlotte.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.963
You just want to show me...
the ropes.

13:55.036 --> 13:58.767
You just want to give me
a leg up to the bottom rung

13:58.840 --> 14:02.038
of that little ladder
called "success."

14:02.111 --> 14:03.373
Oh, yeah.

14:03.446 --> 14:04.913
<i>Come on, Rimshot.</i>

14:04.981 --> 14:07.711
We have to choose
just the right ensemble.

14:07.783 --> 14:09.876
No.
Too formal for dinner.

14:11.454 --> 14:14.048
Ah, the perfect choice...

14:14.123 --> 14:19.618
European styling with
a decidedly American flair.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.897
Charlotte has more
than a professional interest

14:26.970 --> 14:28.562
in yours truly.

14:28.639 --> 14:30.663
And who can blame her?

14:30.740 --> 14:32.208
I've never understood

14:32.276 --> 14:34.801
<i>why I have such a profound
effect on women,</i>

14:34.878 --> 14:37.403
<i>but why argue with success?</i>

14:51.062 --> 14:54.088
Yeah, I'm a man who has just
found his parking space

14:54.165 --> 14:56.258
in the fast lane.

14:58.303 --> 15:00.897
Who knows what lies ahead
for such a man?

15:02.675 --> 15:05.007
<i>Aah-aah-aah-aah!</i>

15:05.077 --> 15:07.840
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah-aah!

15:07.912 --> 15:10.347
<i>Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah-aah!</i>

15:10.416 --> 15:12.008
Aah-aah-aah!

15:12.084 --> 15:18.080
<i>Ahhhhhh...</i>

15:21.827 --> 15:25.161
Wh-o-o-o-oa! Uh!

15:47.354 --> 15:50.688
Well, there's my problem
right there.

15:50.758 --> 15:53.248
Looks like this little wire's
got a little sh...

15:53.326 --> 15:56.091
...hhhhhhhhhhhhh...

15:56.163 --> 15:57.255
...ort in it.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.300
Gosh! Not again.

16:04.372 --> 16:06.465
<i>Woman:
Oh!</i>

16:09.377 --> 16:11.312
<i>Bonsoir.
Dinner for two?</i>

16:11.380 --> 16:12.540
Right.

16:12.614 --> 16:14.138
I'll be your waiter
this evening.

16:14.216 --> 16:15.740
You may call me Philippe.

16:15.817 --> 16:18.148
<i>I'll just give you a moment
to look over your menu.</i>

16:18.219 --> 16:20.688
I had a long talk
with Mr. Pendlesmythe today.

16:20.756 --> 16:22.519
<i>It took a lot of convincing,</i>

16:22.591 --> 16:24.491
<i>but he agreed to accept
your application</i>

16:24.559 --> 16:25.685
for the clerk's job.

16:25.761 --> 16:26.956
<i>He did?</i>

16:27.029 --> 16:29.155
But the thing is...

16:29.231 --> 16:30.994
y-you've got to be
more careful.

16:31.066 --> 16:33.193
I just know
I can win him over.

16:33.268 --> 16:35.999
We'll have that little talk
around the old water cooler

16:36.072 --> 16:39.598
about... team sports
and transmissions,

16:39.674 --> 16:42.235
jock itch... things that just guys
talk about, know what I mean?

16:42.311 --> 16:43.903
I'll have him eatin'

16:43.980 --> 16:45.607
Right out of
the palm of my hand.

16:45.681 --> 16:47.581
<i>I know that its hard,
Ernest,</i>

16:47.650 --> 16:50.449
But Mr. Pendlesmythe
can't stand mistakes.

16:50.521 --> 16:53.065
And between you and I, I don't
think he can stand people, either.

16:53.089 --> 16:55.717
Oh, thats okay. I'm not like
other people, know what I mean?

16:56.826 --> 16:58.158
<i>Frankly, Ernest,</i>

16:58.228 --> 16:59.923
<i>I don't even know
why you want the job.</i>

16:59.997 --> 17:01.828
<i>I mean, he's a horrible man
to work for.</i>

17:01.899 --> 17:03.263
<i>At least
where you are now,</i>

17:03.332 --> 17:05.061
<i>you only have to see him
once a day.</i>

17:05.135 --> 17:06.829
Want to hear something
really funny?

17:06.904 --> 17:08.598
<i>I thought I was gonna
get promoted</i>

17:08.672 --> 17:11.367
<i>to branch manager
this time last year.</i>

17:11.442 --> 17:12.773
What a laugh, huh?

17:12.844 --> 17:15.505
Y-Yeah, but did you hear the one
about the 3-legged dog.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.205
That walked
into the saloon and said,

17:17.281 --> 17:19.943
"I'm lookin' for the guy
that shot my 'paw"'?

17:20.017 --> 17:21.017
Ah heh heh heh heh.

17:22.186 --> 17:24.519
<i>Ernest, this is fun.</i>

17:25.790 --> 17:26.965
I mean, you're pretty
good company.

17:26.990 --> 17:29.221
I come from a long line
of bon vivants.

17:29.294 --> 17:31.194
We're known for
our charm, wit,

17:31.262 --> 17:33.526
and sparkling dinner
conversation, know what I mean?

17:34.666 --> 17:36.294
Ernest?

17:36.368 --> 17:37.960
<i>Ernest,
are you all right?</i>

17:42.807 --> 17:46.005
I recommend the lobster.
Ah heh heh. Ah heh heh heh.

17:46.078 --> 17:47.170
Sir.

17:47.246 --> 17:49.271
<i>Man: There he is.</i>

17:49.348 --> 17:52.317
<i>Hey, warden,
we don't come to your house.</i>

17:56.522 --> 17:58.114
Open C-12.

18:00.527 --> 18:03.086
Well, well, well.

18:03.162 --> 18:06.188
If it isn't the infamous
Mr. Nash.

18:06.265 --> 18:08.496
My sources tell me
that you and your guard dog

18:08.568 --> 18:11.093
got in some trouble yesterday
down in the weight room.

18:11.171 --> 18:13.605
Just mindin'
my own business, warden,

18:13.673 --> 18:16.301
somethin' you might want
to try sometime.

18:20.380 --> 18:23.350
Now, you can make things
easy on yourself,

18:23.417 --> 18:25.647
or you can make 'em hard.

18:25.719 --> 18:27.983
Its up to you.

18:28.054 --> 18:29.783
You hear me, Nash?!

18:29.857 --> 18:31.620
Yeah, I hear you, warden.

18:31.692 --> 18:33.489
Now you hear me.

18:33.561 --> 18:36.121
When you step out
of that cozy little office,

18:36.197 --> 18:37.391
you're on my turf.

18:37.464 --> 18:40.559
And if I were you,
I would watch my step.

18:41.802 --> 18:45.033
If thats a threat,
its a weak one.

18:45.106 --> 18:48.201
<i>Your day's comin'
real soon, Nash...</i>

18:48.277 --> 18:50.938
and we both know it.

18:55.584 --> 18:57.176
<i>Man: Close C-12.</i>

18:57.252 --> 18:59.720
I've got to get out
of this place.

18:59.788 --> 19:02.120
Chuck:
Ernest, you wouldn't believe

19:02.190 --> 19:05.159
the new security system
we have for the van...

19:05.227 --> 19:07.354
maximum protection
and minimum carnage...

19:08.765 --> 19:10.790
And three levels of power!

19:10.867 --> 19:11.799
Ernest, I...

19:11.868 --> 19:13.357
Thanks, Chuck.
Thanks, Bobby.

19:13.435 --> 19:15.494
I'm not finished talkin'
to you about this!

19:15.571 --> 19:16.834
<i>This is really neat!</i>

19:21.077 --> 19:22.101
<i>Here, Rimshot.</i>

19:22.178 --> 19:23.304
Here, boy.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.971
Thats a good boy.
How you been?

19:25.048 --> 19:26.048
Miss your daddy?

19:26.115 --> 19:27.605
Good boy.

19:27.684 --> 19:29.777
Lets see what we got
in the mail.

19:29.852 --> 19:32.117
All right!

19:32.189 --> 19:33.315
Down you go.

19:58.149 --> 20:00.412
Wow!

20:00.484 --> 20:03.215
This is great!
I don't believe it!

20:03.288 --> 20:04.687
Jury duty!

20:04.756 --> 20:09.591
Look, Rimshot!
I've been chosen for jury duty!

20:11.896 --> 20:14.729
This is great!

20:14.799 --> 20:16.562
<i>Chuck!</i>

20:16.635 --> 20:17.830
Bobby!

20:21.307 --> 20:22.831
Chuck! Bobby!

20:22.908 --> 20:24.465
Alley-oop.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.542
Uh-oh.

20:30.082 --> 20:31.709
I hate this minefield.

20:33.119 --> 20:35.179
Its a miracle!
I'm so happy! I'm ecstatic!

20:35.255 --> 20:38.587
Uh, uh,
its a dream come true!

20:38.658 --> 20:40.148
Chuck, Bobby, guess what!

20:41.728 --> 20:44.026
<i>Ernest, you're in the line
of fire! Move it!</i>

20:44.097 --> 20:46.964
<i>Go! Pick 'em up, put 'em down!
Go! Go! Go!</i>

20:47.034 --> 20:48.261
I hate this part!

20:48.334 --> 20:50.166
Ow!

20:51.571 --> 20:53.505
I'm the luckiest guy
in the whole world.

20:53.573 --> 20:54.699
They chose me.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.971
Out of hundreds of thousands
of other people,

20:57.045 --> 20:59.103
they chose me for
United States jury duty.

20:59.179 --> 21:00.441
Isn't that great?

21:00.514 --> 21:01.845
<i>Yeah, great.</i>

21:01.915 --> 21:03.940
Bobby, soup's on!

21:04.018 --> 21:06.043
<i>I mean, the
opportunity to decide...</i>

21:06.120 --> 21:09.851
right or wrong,
good or evil,

21:09.924 --> 21:12.188
regular or unleaded,

21:12.260 --> 21:15.957
to hold a man's life in the
palm of my hand and decide,

21:16.030 --> 21:18.965
"Should I crush it...
or allow it to go free

21:19.033 --> 21:21.559
like a bird
on the wings of time?"

21:26.307 --> 21:27.400
Burn him.

21:33.148 --> 21:35.946
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,</i>

21:36.018 --> 21:39.920
one of the most precious
guarantees in our Constitution

21:39.988 --> 21:41.649
is that of a fair trial.

21:41.724 --> 21:45.957
<i>Every defendant has the right
to one.</i>

21:46.028 --> 21:49.225
<i>This defendant is no exception.</i>

21:49.298 --> 21:53.463
It is you who must decide
his case, not I.

21:53.536 --> 21:57.996
<i>You must weigh the evidence
carefully.</i>

21:59.976 --> 22:01.637
Counselor, you may proceed.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.303
Thank you, your honor.

22:03.379 --> 22:04.937
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:05.014 --> 22:08.542
the state will prove that
the defendant, Rubin Bartlett,

22:08.619 --> 22:11.519
who is a known henchman
of the notorious crime czar

22:11.588 --> 22:13.921
<i>and bank robber
Felix Nash,</i>

22:13.991 --> 22:16.391
did, in fact, murder.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.759
<i>A fellow prisoner
while in jail.</i>

22:19.830 --> 22:22.856
<i>And for this,
the state asks that you extend</i>

22:22.933 --> 22:24.901
<i>his remaining time
of five months</i>

22:24.969 --> 22:29.066
into a sentence of life
without parole.

22:32.210 --> 22:35.144
Ladies and gentlemen,
the defense will show

22:35.212 --> 22:38.148
<i>that the deceased was not
killed by my client.</i>

22:38.216 --> 22:42.050
<i>In fact,
he wasn't killed by anyone.</i>

22:42.120 --> 22:45.112
He died as the result
of a tragic accident,

22:45.190 --> 22:48.557
<i>when,
in a poorly lit stairwell,</i>

22:48.627 --> 22:51.721
<i>he tripped over
an inadequately placed railing</i>

22:51.797 --> 22:57.064
<i>and plunged, regrettably,
to his death.</i>

22:57.135 --> 22:59.569
<i>If there is a guilty party
in this case,</i>

22:59.638 --> 23:02.267
it must surely be
the system,

23:02.341 --> 23:06.744
<i>to allow such unsafe
conditions to exist.</i>

23:08.881 --> 23:11.441
<i>Once you've heard the evidence,
I'm sure you'll agree with me</i>

23:11.517 --> 23:15.147
<i>that the charges against
my client, Mr. Bartlett,</i>

23:15.222 --> 23:16.985
are completely spurious,

23:17.057 --> 23:21.356
and that you will find him...
not guilty.

23:31.906 --> 23:33.167
Ah heh heh heh.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.265
Excuse me, sir.
Are you all right?

23:35.342 --> 23:37.833
Uh, just fine, thank you.

23:45.185 --> 23:47.245
This guy looks
exactly the same as Nash.

23:47.322 --> 23:48.448
Are you crazy?
I...

23:48.523 --> 23:51.981
look, the guy's perfect.
Its downright uncanny.

23:52.060 --> 23:53.722
We can't just...

23:53.796 --> 23:55.263
<i>Itll work.
It will.</i>

23:55.331 --> 23:58.197
<i>Your honor... to allow the jury</i>

23:58.266 --> 24:01.030
to fully understand
the case for the defense,

24:01.102 --> 24:02.832
we feel as though
its imperative

24:02.905 --> 24:04.668
that they see
the environment

24:04.740 --> 24:07.674
within which this
unfortunate accident occurred.

24:07.742 --> 24:10.405
Therefore, we move that
these proceedings be continued

24:10.479 --> 24:13.141
to the site
of the alleged crime.

24:13.215 --> 24:16.343
Well, I find this request
highly irregular.

24:16.418 --> 24:19.149
However, if the prosecution
has no objections...

24:19.221 --> 24:21.815
<i>Prosecutor: Uh,
no objections, your honor.</i>

24:21.891 --> 24:24.018
So be it.

24:24.093 --> 24:28.428
These proceedings will reconvene tomorrow at
10:00 a.m. At the Dracup Correctional Facility.

24:29.499 --> 24:31.625
Oh, boy!

24:31.700 --> 24:33.896
A field trip!

24:35.972 --> 24:40.205
I'm telling you... this guy
is right on the numbers.

24:40.278 --> 24:41.540
Its so simple.

24:41.612 --> 24:42.544
Towel.

24:42.613 --> 24:43.874
We make the switch,

24:43.947 --> 24:45.847
you get in on the jury
and find me innocent,

24:45.916 --> 24:47.942
then you walk away
a free man,

24:48.019 --> 24:51.386
and I make sure this guy Ernest
gets whats coming to you.

24:51.455 --> 24:52.717
In and out...

24:52.790 --> 24:55.623
wham, bam...
and its over.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.061
Yeah.

24:59.130 --> 25:02.725
I'm a real big fan
of the early release program.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.255
<i>Attorney: I would like to thank
the members of the jury</i>

25:24.323 --> 25:26.292
<i>for bearing with us.</i>

25:26.359 --> 25:27.917
<i>Dracup Prison is...</i>

25:27.994 --> 25:31.724
Okay, Lyle, we got one shot
at this, so make it count.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.822
<i>...there are those
that must endure its reality.</i>

25:33.900 --> 25:38.496
<i>So, what we are here
to talk about today...</i>

25:38.571 --> 25:40.766
<i>is death... horrible...</i>

25:40.840 --> 25:44.298
frightening,
something to be avoided.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.436
<i>But is death murder?</i>

25:46.512 --> 25:48.810
Is murder death?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.747
I think not.

25:50.818 --> 25:53.980
<i>And yet, though we must feel
some sympathy for the victim,</i>

25:54.053 --> 25:56.180
we cannot...

25:56.255 --> 25:57.746
Psst!

25:57.825 --> 25:59.258
By wrongfully accusing...

25:59.326 --> 26:02.124
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is exactly what...

26:02.196 --> 26:03.754
<i>The state has made no case.</i>

26:03.831 --> 26:04.856
Psst!

26:04.933 --> 26:06.476
They've presented
no compelling evidence.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.592
Come here, you.

26:07.668 --> 26:10.432
Why? Because there is none...

26:10.504 --> 26:11.835
Am I me?

26:11.905 --> 26:13.771
<i>Nash: Come here.</i>

26:13.842 --> 26:15.241
Huh?

26:15.310 --> 26:16.868
We don't dispute that.

26:16.945 --> 26:21.382
Of course, all of us,
as reasonable human beings,

26:21.449 --> 26:23.246
mourn them...

26:26.588 --> 26:27.954
Ugh!

26:29.924 --> 26:33.018
<i>Attorney: Certainly...</i>

26:34.295 --> 26:36.958
<i>Hurry up, Lyle.</i>

26:37.033 --> 26:39.263
And keeping this in mind,

26:39.335 --> 26:43.669
I would like to move these
proceedings to the staircase...

26:43.739 --> 26:46.003
<i>Man: Right this way,
please.</i>

26:46.075 --> 26:47.508
Heh heh heh.

26:51.415 --> 26:54.076
All right, Rubin,
lets go.

27:00.157 --> 27:03.217
Nash! Wake up!

27:03.293 --> 27:07.024
No napping
during exercise period.

27:09.099 --> 27:10.498
<i>No talking.</i>

27:10.567 --> 27:14.197
Yes, sir, officer,
whatever you say.

27:14.272 --> 27:17.604
<i>Boy, this is great!</i>

27:17.674 --> 27:20.165
A brief workout
to gather our thoughts,

27:20.243 --> 27:22.974
then its off to
the jury room to decide...

27:23.047 --> 27:24.412
very ingenious.

27:24.482 --> 27:27.110
And they even gave us
these nifty workout clothes.

27:27.185 --> 27:29.118
Boy, I love jury duty,
don't you?

27:29.186 --> 27:30.552
Whatever you say,
Mr. Nash.

27:30.621 --> 27:32.282
Oh, you don't have to be
so formal.

27:32.356 --> 27:34.483
You can just call me Ernest,
Ernest P. Worrell.

27:34.559 --> 27:36.254
Hey! You know the rules.
No talking.

27:36.327 --> 27:37.852
Yes, sir.

27:37.930 --> 27:40.955
Kind of strict,
aren't they?

27:42.733 --> 27:44.894
<i>Man: Cellblock B-29,
move to the left.</i>

27:44.970 --> 27:46.267
<i>The rest of you, move...</i>

27:46.338 --> 27:48.670
<i>Man ♪2: "C" to the left,
"D" to the right.</i>

27:48.740 --> 27:50.708
Ah, lunch...
how thoughtful.

27:50.776 --> 27:53.745
For the mind to work,
the body must have fuel.

27:53.812 --> 27:55.473
A lot of jurors here today.

27:55.547 --> 27:58.243
There must be
a lot of trials going on...

27:58.317 --> 28:01.310
a sad commentary
on our disintegrating society,

28:01.387 --> 28:02.649
know what I mean?

28:04.523 --> 28:06.286
<i>Man: All right,
brace it up.</i>

28:23.777 --> 28:27.234
Oh, uh, I don't think
our table has any steak sauce.

28:27.313 --> 28:28.575
Get up!

28:28.648 --> 28:30.411
I-I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

28:30.483 --> 28:32.315
I should have waited
for the others.

28:33.721 --> 28:35.120
Eat, greaseball!

28:37.258 --> 28:39.954
I didn't order greaseball.

28:40.027 --> 28:41.790
Wrap it up.
Wrap it up.

28:41.862 --> 28:44.387
<i>Man: All right,
stand to the back.</i>

28:44.465 --> 28:46.433
Backs against the wall.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.196
<i>Open up "C" block.</i>

28:48.270 --> 28:51.067
All right,
lets move it!

28:51.138 --> 28:53.368
Come on, come on,
come on, lets go.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.931
<i>Ernest: We're sequestered,</i>

28:55.010 --> 28:57.535
<i>a- and on top of that,
we can't even leave.</i>

28:57.612 --> 29:01.309
Oh, this is great.
This is just great.

29:01.383 --> 29:02.680
Uh!

29:02.751 --> 29:05.549
I hope you've got a good
story to tell my boss.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.952
After all, I do have
a living to earn.

29:08.023 --> 29:09.320
Now, look, Nash...

29:09.391 --> 29:11.758
My name is Worrell,
Ernest P. Worrell.

29:11.827 --> 29:13.260
Oh, Mr. Funny Man, huh?

29:13.329 --> 29:15.853
Yeah, Mr. Funny Man,
you'll think funny

29:15.931 --> 29:18.730
when you're tapping
to the tune of 220, son!

29:20.603 --> 29:22.298
That is
the rudest bailiff

29:22.371 --> 29:24.202
I have ever seen
in my life.

29:24.273 --> 29:25.206
Ugh!

29:25.275 --> 29:28.801
Oh!

29:28.878 --> 29:31.642
Wait a minute.

29:31.714 --> 29:34.047
Ooh! Oh!

29:34.117 --> 29:36.312
<i>Man: Hey, come on,
knock it off!</i>

29:36.386 --> 29:38.649
You're that guy.

29:38.721 --> 29:41.122
Bailiff! Bailiff!

29:41.191 --> 29:43.250
You're in big trouble
now, pal.

29:43.327 --> 29:44.327
Bailiff!

29:44.394 --> 29:45.656
What is it, Nash?

29:45.729 --> 29:46.991
You see that guy?

29:47.064 --> 29:48.190
Yeah. So?

29:48.265 --> 29:50.256
No, I mean look...
look at him.

29:50.334 --> 29:51.460
Come closer. Look.

29:51.535 --> 29:53.935
You see that guy?
He's not on the jury.

29:54.004 --> 29:55.904
This man is a prisoner.

29:55.973 --> 29:59.000
I ought to throw you in
the hole for that, Nash!

29:59.077 --> 30:01.738
- The hole?
- Yeah, the hole!

30:01.812 --> 30:05.806
The hole, like...
like in solitary, the hole...

30:05.883 --> 30:08.943
like in real prison,
like in real,

30:09.020 --> 30:11.546
really, really, really,
really, really real prison?

30:11.624 --> 30:13.523
The hoosegow, the slammer,
the joint,

30:13.591 --> 30:16.355
alcatraz, San Quentin,
Sing Sing...

30:16.427 --> 30:19.295
Oh, no, I... I'm in...
I'm in...

30:19.365 --> 30:25.894
jai-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-I!

30:25.970 --> 30:27.905
Jail!

30:28.841 --> 30:30.741
Ha ha ha ha ha.

30:30.809 --> 30:33.471
Your honor, we have
reached a decision.

30:35.148 --> 30:38.446
We find the defendant,
Rubin Bartlett, not guilty.

30:40.953 --> 30:44.549
Have you... carefully weighed
the evidence?

30:47.661 --> 30:49.287
Yes, we have,
your honor.

30:49.361 --> 30:52.422
<i>The defendant,
found not guilty,</i>

30:52.499 --> 30:55.468
will return
to the state penitentiary,

30:55.535 --> 30:58.994
<i>where he will complete
his previous sentence.</i>

31:01.241 --> 31:02.333
Mm-hmm.

31:02.409 --> 31:03.876
Good night.

31:14.588 --> 31:16.180
Lets go!

31:16.257 --> 31:18.418
Ernest,
we're late for work,

31:18.492 --> 31:21.428
and Mr. P. Does not
appreciate tardiness.

31:21.496 --> 31:23.487
<i>So, how'd it go,
Mr. Juror?</i>

31:30.439 --> 31:33.704
<i>Now, on to the real
important question...</i>

31:33.775 --> 31:35.503
<i>how did your date go?</i>

31:35.576 --> 31:38.239
Oh, we had a nice time.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.712
Nice time?

31:39.781 --> 31:41.715
Now, whats the deal
with the hair?

31:41.783 --> 31:44.082
You bringing
the wet look back?

31:44.153 --> 31:45.848
I'm just trying
something new.

31:45.922 --> 31:49.322
Oh. Where's your, uh,
where's your sky piece,

31:49.391 --> 31:51.450
you know, your lid,
your brown cap?

31:51.526 --> 31:53.495
<i>I never see you
without that brown cap.</i>

31:53.563 --> 31:55.053
I must've lost it
somewhere.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.667
Bobby...

32:00.236 --> 32:03.728
...there's something
bad wrong here.

32:10.414 --> 32:14.008
This guy...

32:14.083 --> 32:16.746
<i>This guy...</i>

32:16.820 --> 32:19.812
is in love... L-U-V!

32:19.890 --> 32:21.323
<i>Ernest is in love!
Ha ha ha ha!</i>

32:21.392 --> 32:24.190
<i>♪ Ernest and Charlotte,
sittin' in a tree ♪</i>

32:24.261 --> 32:26.923
<i>♪ K-I-S-S-l-N-G ♪</i>

32:26.997 --> 32:28.931
<i>♪ First comes love
and then comes marriage ♪</i>

32:28.999 --> 32:31.594
<i>♪ Then comes Ernest

32:31.669 --> 32:33.261
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

32:48.653 --> 32:51.781
<i>Chuck: Ernest, you're not
gonna believe this,</i>

32:51.856 --> 32:55.020
<i>but we have a new security
system at the bank.</i>

32:57.763 --> 33:01.358
A bank?
I work in a bank?

33:03.936 --> 33:05.801
Lets go!

33:08.541 --> 33:09.803
<i>Man: Close "C" block.</i>

33:09.875 --> 33:12.605
Look, look, I tell you...
I'm not this guy Nash.

33:12.678 --> 33:15.545
If you're not Mr. Nash,
how come you look like him?

33:15.614 --> 33:18.448
Because he's obviously
a very attractive criminal.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.611
Yeah,
thats right, too.

33:20.687 --> 33:23.052
Lyle, tell him who I am.

33:23.122 --> 33:25.216
<i>Man: Hey, Mr. Nash,
did he fall for it?</i>

33:25.292 --> 33:29.126
Thats real funny,
Mr. Nash.

33:31.198 --> 33:32.689
Open up C-12.

33:34.768 --> 33:37.202
Did you miss me,
Mr. Nash?

33:37.270 --> 33:38.703
Close it up.

33:38.772 --> 33:42.231
You! You know
I'm not Nash.

33:42.310 --> 33:44.710
Of course you are...

33:44.779 --> 33:47.646
Ernest.

33:50.485 --> 33:52.214
You've got nothing
to worry about.

33:52.286 --> 33:53.878
I'll make sure
this thing plays

33:53.955 --> 33:55.446
just the way
we laid it out.

33:55.524 --> 33:59.118
Just make sure everything
stays in line on your end.

33:59.193 --> 34:01.627
I've got another deal
working here,

34:01.696 --> 34:04.165
and there'll be
a cut in it for you.

34:04.233 --> 34:06.360
That idiot
you switched me for

34:06.435 --> 34:07.766
has a job in a bank.

34:07.836 --> 34:09.166
I don't believe it.

34:09.237 --> 34:11.763
Sometimes the cards
just fall your way.

34:11.840 --> 34:13.637
Yeah.

34:13.708 --> 34:17.304
You just make sure nobody figures
out that idiot isn't me.

34:17.379 --> 34:18.710
Listen, little man,

34:18.781 --> 34:21.715
you've pushed me
as far as you're going to.

34:21.783 --> 34:24.081
I've got
some big things riding,

34:24.152 --> 34:26.678
and if you know
whats good for you,

34:26.755 --> 34:28.087
you'll play ball.

34:28.157 --> 34:30.420
O-Oh, great!
What position?

34:30.493 --> 34:33.085
You do like we say,

34:33.161 --> 34:35.687
or Lyle here
will break your back...

34:35.764 --> 34:37.665
Like that.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.864
Well, then he'll just
have to break my back

34:41.938 --> 34:44.565
like... like that thing
you guys did.

34:44.641 --> 34:46.370
Real men
are not intimidated

34:46.442 --> 34:49.241
by physical threats against
their personal selves,

34:49.313 --> 34:51.645
and ironically,
neither am I.

34:51.715 --> 34:54.809
What about violence
against other people?

34:54.885 --> 34:56.146
What do you mean?

34:56.219 --> 34:59.781
I mean, while you're being
Mr. Nash in here,

34:59.857 --> 35:02.621
Mr. Nash is being you
out there.

35:02.693 --> 35:05.390
Yeah,
he's living your life,

35:05.463 --> 35:08.454
working at your job
at the bank,

35:08.532 --> 35:10.932
hanging out
with your friends,

35:11.001 --> 35:12.765
and if you don't behave,

35:12.837 --> 35:15.670
he may have to get
very strict

35:15.740 --> 35:18.937
with someone
you really care about.

35:19.010 --> 35:20.671
Charlotte? No!

35:20.745 --> 35:23.009
That your girl?

35:23.081 --> 35:24.446
Well, sort of.

35:24.516 --> 35:27.611
Well, she's gonna
"sort of" be dead

35:27.687 --> 35:29.780
if you don't play along.

35:29.855 --> 35:32.049
You lay one finger
on her, and I'll...

35:32.123 --> 35:33.488
Hey, relax.

35:33.558 --> 35:37.325
<i>She'll be all right
as long as you behave.</i>

35:39.799 --> 35:42.233
Okay,
what do I have to do?

35:42.301 --> 35:46.169
You've got to be Nash.

35:49.709 --> 35:52.235
Okay, Lyle, this guy Nash,
he's a tough guy, right,

35:52.312 --> 35:53.643
he's a gangster.

35:53.714 --> 35:55.180
Okay, how about this?

35:55.247 --> 35:56.839
You dirty rat,

35:56.916 --> 35:58.908
you're the guy
that shot my brother,

35:58.986 --> 36:01.648
and I'm the guy
thats gonna shoot you.

36:03.090 --> 36:04.990
Y-You dirty rat,

36:05.058 --> 36:07.117
y-you're the guy
that, eh, eh, shot my brother,

36:07.194 --> 36:09.662
and I'm the guy
thats gonna shoot you...

36:09.730 --> 36:11.595
every goddang one of you.

36:11.665 --> 36:13.189
Too old, huh?

36:14.002 --> 36:16.971
Hey, yo, Murdock,

36:17.038 --> 36:19.631
you're the guy
that shot my brother, right,

36:19.706 --> 36:22.301
and I'm the guy
thats gonna shoot you, eh?

36:22.377 --> 36:23.776
All right.

36:23.845 --> 36:25.278
Of all the gin joints

36:25.346 --> 36:27.143
in all the cities
in all the world,

36:27.215 --> 36:30.946
you've got to waltz into
my place and shoot my brother.

36:31.019 --> 36:32.281
Play it, Sam.

36:32.353 --> 36:34.344
The piano
will cover up the shot.

36:34.422 --> 36:36.185
Why, you dirty rat,

36:36.257 --> 36:38.021
you're the guy
that shot my brother,

36:38.093 --> 36:41.721
and I'm the guy
thats gonna shoot you.

36:42.697 --> 36:45.394
Why, you're the dirty,
scum-suckin' pig dog

36:45.467 --> 36:46.798
that shot my brother...

36:46.869 --> 36:48.962
And I'm the man

36:49.038 --> 36:50.471
who's going to destroy you...

36:50.539 --> 36:52.405
'Cause
I'm just that kind of guy.

36:52.475 --> 36:53.736
How 'bout that?

37:03.319 --> 37:05.377
<i>Hey, what are you
doing here?</i>

37:05.454 --> 37:07.081
Uh, oh, I was just, uh...

37:07.156 --> 37:09.785
Well, at least
you're not in the vault.

37:09.859 --> 37:12.259
What would I be doing
in the vault?

37:12.328 --> 37:14.956
Who knows why you're there
every morning?

37:15.031 --> 37:16.226
Yeah, right.

37:16.300 --> 37:19.234
Well, how do I get in there,
you suppose?

37:19.302 --> 37:20.997
I don't know.

37:21.071 --> 37:23.383
Hey, whats the matter with your voice?
You sound different.

37:23.407 --> 37:26.205
Oh,
I've got a little laryngitis.

37:26.277 --> 37:27.403
<i>Hmm, I'm sorry.</i>

37:27.478 --> 37:29.138
Hey, I wouldn't let
Mr. Pendlesmythe

37:29.212 --> 37:30.839
catch me in his chair
if I were you,

37:30.914 --> 37:32.576
and I'd get my feet
off his desk

37:32.650 --> 37:34.970
because you know how he feels
about his famous golf trophy.

37:35.019 --> 37:36.748
Yeah.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.152
You know, by the way,

37:38.222 --> 37:40.747
I had a real nice time
the other night.

37:40.825 --> 37:43.020
I think it was
really good for me

37:43.094 --> 37:46.690
to just get away from work
and just have some fun.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.098
Yeah, I had a nice time,
too, baby.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.726
"Baby"?

37:51.803 --> 37:55.364
Ernest, sometimes
you can be so weird.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.209
Good morning,
Miss Sparrow.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.574
Good morning.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.045
And what are we doing

38:02.115 --> 38:04.639
<i>behind the bank
presidents desk?</i>

38:04.716 --> 38:07.184
I was just gonna
leave you a note.

38:07.252 --> 38:09.049
About what?

38:09.121 --> 38:10.817
About, um...

38:10.890 --> 38:12.983
Uh, Ernest wants to
formally apply

38:13.059 --> 38:14.390
for that clerk's job.

38:15.528 --> 38:16.994
Yeah, yeah, thats it.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.294
Ha. I see...
Ernest the clerk.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.731
Hmm. What a great idea.

38:22.802 --> 38:25.397
<i>Well, now you don't have to
leave a note, do you?</i>

38:25.472 --> 38:26.632
So get out from there!

38:26.707 --> 38:28.901
Whats the matter
with your hair?

38:28.975 --> 38:31.375
<i>Is that some sort
of punk thing, huh?</i>

38:31.444 --> 38:33.504
I was just trying
something new.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.013
Just look at you.

38:35.082 --> 38:37.516
You are a poor excuse for
a member of the human race.

38:37.584 --> 38:39.313
You and that big nose
and ugly face

38:39.386 --> 38:40.797
<i>have caused so much trouble
around here,</i>

38:40.821 --> 38:43.312
I should be given a medal
for tolerating you.

38:45.392 --> 38:48.385
I would choose my words
differently if I were you.

38:48.463 --> 38:51.227
Oh? Should I use
smaller ones?

38:51.299 --> 38:52.663
How 'bout this?

38:52.733 --> 38:53.825
No!

38:53.901 --> 38:57.497
Now get out of my office,
both of you!

39:06.781 --> 39:08.715
Oh, I'm sorry, Ernest.

39:08.783 --> 39:10.751
He promised he wasn't
gonna do that.

39:10.819 --> 39:13.220
Well... well, who cares
what he thinks anyway?

39:13.289 --> 39:15.222
I'm really proud of you
for trying.

39:15.290 --> 39:17.850
I mean, you're starting
to take stock of yourself.

39:17.926 --> 39:20.794
When you were in there
talking to Mr. Pendlesmythe,

39:20.863 --> 39:23.331
it was as if you were
a whole different person.

39:23.399 --> 39:24.730
What do you mean?

39:24.800 --> 39:27.394
Well, I-I mean
that I'm proud of you.

39:31.407 --> 39:33.602
Ernest,
do you have any idea

39:33.676 --> 39:37.272
how long you've made
me and Bobby wait in that van?

39:38.848 --> 39:40.338
7.5 minutes.

39:40.416 --> 39:42.351
I want to tell you
something about time.

39:42.419 --> 39:43.818
My time is worth money,

39:43.887 --> 39:47.220
<i>and I don't think you
make that kind of money</i>

39:47.290 --> 39:50.158
<i>to pay me for my time.</i>

39:50.228 --> 39:53.219
Now, lets put
the hammer down.

39:56.032 --> 40:01.369
Okay, today will be
your first test as Mr. Nash.

40:01.439 --> 40:02.769
Don't worry, fellas,

40:02.839 --> 40:05.400
you are talking
to a consummate actor,

40:05.476 --> 40:08.570
a brilliant interpreter
of character and nuance,

40:08.646 --> 40:10.375
a professional practitioner

40:10.448 --> 40:15.476
in the style and method
of the great Stradivarius.

40:15.553 --> 40:17.987
<i>Man: Bring the sheets
back over in the corner.</i>

40:18.055 --> 40:19.283
<i>Just pile them up.</i>

40:19.357 --> 40:20.985
<i>Yeah, just throw 'em
anywhere.</i>

40:21.059 --> 40:24.119
<i>Man ♪2: Hey, Jesus, don't
overstuff the machine again.</i>

40:24.196 --> 40:27.062
<i>Man ♪3: Hey, Bill, we need
more starch over here.</i>

40:27.131 --> 40:28.929
<i>Man ♪4: All right,
come on.</i>

40:29.001 --> 40:31.401
You got something
on your shirt?

40:31.470 --> 40:32.869
Ah heh heh heh heh.

40:36.476 --> 40:39.103
Today's the day, Nash.
My boy's ready.

40:39.177 --> 40:40.439
Not now, Vinny.

40:40.512 --> 40:43.072
Mr. Nash doesn't have
anything to prove.

40:43.148 --> 40:44.514
Everybody's waiting.

40:44.584 --> 40:47.451
You're not gonna
chicken out now, are you?

40:47.520 --> 40:50.647
I don't know the meaning
of the word "chicken."

40:50.722 --> 40:53.658
<i>Man: If you lose
this one, Nash,</i>

40:53.726 --> 40:56.217
<i>we're gonna run things.</i>

40:56.296 --> 41:00.165
I know you've
never lost, Nash... yet,

41:00.234 --> 41:03.999
but my man Spider here
is gonna change all that.

41:05.104 --> 41:07.505
<i>Okay?</i>

41:07.574 --> 41:09.132
- Go!
- Grrr!

41:09.209 --> 41:11.177
<i>Ernest: Wait a minute!</i>

41:11.245 --> 41:13.872
I wasn't even ready!
Thats not fair!

41:13.947 --> 41:16.439
Listen,
where I come from, mister,

41:16.517 --> 41:19.384
you're supposed to say,
"Ready, set, go."

41:19.453 --> 41:23.220
<i>Thats the official way,
and I want a rematch.</i>

41:23.291 --> 41:25.485
Nash, you're a glutton
for punishment.

41:25.559 --> 41:27.618
You're in
way over your head, man.

41:27.695 --> 41:29.526
They're gonna
figure you out.

41:29.596 --> 41:31.895
He was just lucky.
I can take this guy.

41:35.236 --> 41:38.672
<i>Man: Okay, here we go.</i>

41:38.740 --> 41:41.402
<i>Ready... set...</i>

41:42.777 --> 41:43.777
<i>go!</i>

41:44.879 --> 41:46.438
<i>Come on, man!
Come on, baby!</i>

41:46.515 --> 41:47.675
Come on, Spider!

41:47.750 --> 41:48.909
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

41:48.984 --> 41:51.077
<i>Come on, Spider!
Come on, man!</i>

41:51.152 --> 41:53.052
Right there, right there,
right there!

41:54.156 --> 41:57.557
<i>Come on, Spider.
Come on, baby.</i>

42:00.362 --> 42:01.091
Smoke?

42:01.163 --> 42:02.027
<i>Man: Aw, man!</i>

42:02.098 --> 42:03.565
That was close.

42:03.632 --> 42:05.759
Next case.

42:07.837 --> 42:09.897
Man, why don't you
shut your mouth?

42:09.973 --> 42:11.940
The real Mr. Nash
don't say much.

42:12.008 --> 42:13.873
Well, maybe
he ought to, right?

42:13.943 --> 42:17.004
I mean, after all, I'm just
reaching for the character.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.945
What do you know
about the pain

42:19.016 --> 42:20.677
an actor
must go through...

42:20.751 --> 42:23.117
You straighten up,
or I'll show you pain,

42:23.186 --> 42:24.448
and don't you forget

42:24.521 --> 42:27.456
your loved ones
on the outside.

42:33.664 --> 42:36.063
<i>Chuck: Ernest, Ernest,
we're sorry.</i>

42:36.133 --> 42:38.897
<i>Bobby didn't know
the mace can was loaded.</i>

42:38.969 --> 42:41.962
<i>Bobby, how many times
do I have to tell you...</i>

42:42.040 --> 42:43.974
Yuh! Get off me,
you mutt!

42:44.042 --> 42:46.272
<i>Get out of here!</i>

43:04.363 --> 43:05.728
This is pathetic.

43:05.798 --> 43:08.232
This guy's better off
in jail.

43:09.535 --> 43:11.162
Whoa! Ugh!

43:12.204 --> 43:13.296
Ugh!

43:22.414 --> 43:23.540
Oof!

43:23.615 --> 43:24.809
Eee!

43:27.620 --> 43:31.078
I will effect my escape
using a bar of soap,

43:31.157 --> 43:34.059
a common, ordinary
household spoon,

43:34.128 --> 43:36.061
and a tin of shoe polish.

43:36.129 --> 43:39.656
Thank goodness
I paid attention in art class.

43:39.732 --> 43:43.134
Don't worry, Charlotte,
I'll save you.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.331
Your hero is on his way.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.014
Hey, screw!

43:55.082 --> 43:56.675
<i>Yeah, you!</i>

43:56.751 --> 43:57.751
Come here!

43:57.818 --> 43:59.183
<i>What now, Nash?</i>

43:59.253 --> 44:02.814
Open the door
or I'll waste ya.

44:04.058 --> 44:05.321
Ah heh heh heh heh.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.691
Assault rifle on a rope,
the perfect gift

44:07.762 --> 44:09.888
for the mercenary
who has everything.

44:09.964 --> 44:11.956
Ah ha ha ha ha.
Ah ha.

44:12.033 --> 44:13.762
<i>Man: Shut up!</i>

44:13.835 --> 44:15.769
<i>Chuck: Mr. P.!</i>

44:15.837 --> 44:18.704
<i>Mr. P., could I have
just one moment</i>

44:18.773 --> 44:20.901
of your time, sir,
please?

44:20.977 --> 44:23.706
I want to introduce you
to our latest arsenal

44:23.778 --> 44:25.245
in the war against crime.

44:25.313 --> 44:26.371
Look...

44:26.448 --> 44:29.680
Eh! Mr. P.,
its very, very special.

44:29.752 --> 44:33.346
Well... all right,
but I'm late for dinner.

44:33.421 --> 44:35.049
Great. You'll eat.

44:35.124 --> 44:38.252
Just follow me,
please, sir.

44:38.327 --> 44:41.194
Okay, can I have you
here, please? Thank you.

44:41.264 --> 44:43.199
You won't be needing this.
Lets... lets go.

44:43.267 --> 44:46.030
<i>Lets open up.
Open up. Thank you.</i>

44:46.102 --> 44:47.763
Bobby...

44:48.371 --> 44:49.599
Please.

44:54.378 --> 44:57.141
Mr. P., do you have
that funny, little acidy taste

44:57.213 --> 44:59.478
in the back of your throat...
like that?

44:59.550 --> 45:01.142
Uh-huh.

45:01.218 --> 45:02.862
Can you taste it?
Do you know what that is?

45:02.886 --> 45:03.978
Unh-unh.

45:04.054 --> 45:05.180
Fear.

45:05.255 --> 45:07.451
Thats what your common,
class-X criminal

45:07.525 --> 45:09.253
would be feeling
at this moment

45:09.326 --> 45:10.953
if he were in your situation.

45:11.028 --> 45:13.019
<i>- Oh.
- Bobby...</i>

45:13.096 --> 45:14.792
its only a simulation.

45:16.968 --> 45:19.698
<i>I don't think I'd touch
those bars, Mr. P.,</i>

45:19.771 --> 45:22.239
unless you want
200,000 volts of electricity

45:22.307 --> 45:23.797
jolting through your body.

45:23.875 --> 45:25.137
Think about that.

45:26.644 --> 45:27.736
<i>Bobby...</i>

45:33.785 --> 45:36.310
Mr. P., uh, have a nice dinner

45:36.387 --> 45:42.190
and a... and a good
nights sleep... sir.

45:42.261 --> 45:45.594
Eh, he's had
a real hard day.

45:51.036 --> 45:52.629
<i>Ernest:
Don't worry, Charlotte,</i>

45:52.706 --> 45:54.401
<i>I'll soon be flying
into your arms</i>

45:54.474 --> 45:56.998
<i>with my superior knowledge
of mathematics and geometry.</i>

45:57.076 --> 45:59.978
<i>The square root and angle
of your lower hypotenuse</i>

46:00.046 --> 46:03.174
times the angle of your pi...
and that sort of thing.

46:03.250 --> 46:05.514
<i>Let the countdown begin.</i>

46:05.585 --> 46:09.112
3... 2... 11/2...

46:09.189 --> 46:11.589
<i>1... 3/4...</i>

46:11.658 --> 46:13.683
zero... fire!

46:15.529 --> 46:16.996
Whaaaaa!

47:27.071 --> 47:31.598
<i>You see, casting
is all in the wrist.</i>

47:31.674 --> 47:33.768
<i>Its a sport of kings,</i>

47:33.844 --> 47:35.471
a game of inches.

47:38.949 --> 47:41.884
<i>And as soon as your game fish
takes the bait,</i>

47:41.952 --> 47:47.515
'tis important to give the line a
sharp tug in order to set the hook,

47:47.591 --> 47:49.389
and then quickly reel it in.

47:51.463 --> 47:54.056
Ha ha ha ha!

47:59.137 --> 48:00.468
Ah heh heh heh heh heh.

48:00.505 --> 48:02.496
I was gonna throw it back,
honest.

48:03.876 --> 48:05.002
Nooo!

48:05.077 --> 48:06.805
That ought to hold ya.

48:06.878 --> 48:09.676
Don't you have anything
in a pastel blue?

48:10.916 --> 48:13.146
Accessories
are so important.

48:14.420 --> 48:17.820
Accessories!

48:27.634 --> 48:31.569
The way they run
this institution is an outrage

48:31.637 --> 48:34.937
for a poor, tired, old,
lonely woman like me,

48:35.008 --> 48:36.600
her only son a felon,

48:36.676 --> 48:39.543
though not a terribly
successful one.

48:39.613 --> 48:42.605
Young man...

48:42.682 --> 48:44.274
<i>Young man.</i>

48:44.351 --> 48:46.876
Young man, could you please
open that gate?

48:46.953 --> 48:48.853
I left my car running
outside.

48:48.922 --> 48:51.949
Ma'am, can you tell me how
you got through this gate?

48:52.026 --> 48:54.357
The visitors' area is on
the other side of the prison.

48:54.428 --> 48:56.623
I brought him up
as best I could,

48:56.696 --> 48:58.426
but sometimes a bad seed

48:58.499 --> 49:01.059
falls from even
the most fragile flower.

49:01.135 --> 49:02.775
Ma'am, you're not going
through this gate.

49:02.804 --> 49:05.204
<i>Is this the way you treat
your mother?</i>

49:05.273 --> 49:06.763
Is this the kind of abuse

49:06.841 --> 49:08.741
<i>that poor woman
must endure?</i>

49:08.810 --> 49:10.903
Well, I guess my mother
is a little bit mad...

49:10.978 --> 49:12.913
Mm-hmm. You ought to be
in the slammer

49:12.981 --> 49:15.415
with the rest
of these misfits.

49:15.484 --> 49:18.748
If you had any remorse
at all for the horror

49:18.820 --> 49:20.311
<i>you put your own mother
through,</i>

49:20.389 --> 49:21.981
you'd open that gate.

49:22.057 --> 49:24.992
I have a car overheating
as we speak.

49:27.895 --> 49:30.456
Okay, okay!

49:30.532 --> 49:32.864
<i>Lets open the east gate!</i>

49:32.935 --> 49:34.800
There,
now are you satisfied?

49:34.870 --> 49:38.034
I'll tell your mother
how her son has improved

49:38.107 --> 49:41.303
despite his shaded and
somewhat checkered past.

49:44.581 --> 49:49.041
The doctor told me I'd
only have to wear these

49:49.118 --> 49:50.710
until after the surgery.

49:50.787 --> 49:51.913
Oh! Oh! Oh!

49:55.391 --> 49:59.021
Ernest, since you're part
of the night family

49:59.096 --> 50:00.256
here at the bank,

50:00.331 --> 50:04.130
I'm gonna show you
something new.

50:05.768 --> 50:07.634
<i>You see that?</i>

50:07.705 --> 50:12.404
That is only to be used during an
officer-in-distress situation.

50:12.476 --> 50:14.068
Do you understand?

50:14.144 --> 50:15.577
Which, I might add,

50:15.646 --> 50:18.342
we hope will be
few and far between.

50:19.950 --> 50:23.717
What could happen in a quiet,
little bank like this?

50:23.788 --> 50:26.382
Eh... will you take
the edge off, Bobby?

50:26.458 --> 50:29.757
I mean... Hey, Bobby! If
I was going by the book,

50:29.828 --> 50:31.887
I wouldn't have said
anything,

50:31.963 --> 50:33.294
but its only Ernest!

50:33.365 --> 50:35.731
Ha ha ha!
He... Bobby!

50:37.296 --> 50:39.730
Well, Mr. Nash,
how's our special prisoner?

50:39.799 --> 50:40.959
Just fine, thanks.

50:41.033 --> 50:43.763
Of course, the place
could be a little homier.

50:43.836 --> 50:45.168
Maybe some curtains...

50:45.239 --> 50:47.707
I don't
need nothin' from nobody.

50:47.774 --> 50:50.106
I especially
don't need nothin'

50:50.177 --> 50:51.666
from no lousy screws.

50:51.744 --> 50:54.509
Tough guy... right to the end,
huh, Nash?

50:54.581 --> 50:56.674
<i>Just about 24 hours to go.</i>

50:56.750 --> 50:59.776
Well, yeah, whats it
to you, warden?

50:59.853 --> 51:03.186
Besides, I'll be getting
out of here soon.

51:03.257 --> 51:05.589
<i>Yeah, you'll be getting out
all right...</i>

51:05.659 --> 51:07.957
horizontally.

51:11.299 --> 51:14.699
<i>Man: Close cellblock "C."</i>

51:14.768 --> 51:17.499
Did you hear that? I'll be
getting out in 24 hours.

51:17.572 --> 51:20.063
You just have to know
how to talk to these people.

51:20.141 --> 51:25.512
Don't worry, Rubin, I'll put
in a good word for you, too.

51:25.581 --> 51:26.808
Mr. P.
Mr. P.

51:26.881 --> 51:29.281
Can I talk...
wait, wait.

51:29.350 --> 51:32.684
Hey, can I... can I talk
to you for just one second?

51:32.755 --> 51:34.120
What is it now?

51:34.189 --> 51:36.214
Lets go this way,
please.

51:38.126 --> 51:42.826
Mr. P., I want to talk
to you about laser beams...

51:42.898 --> 51:46.334
<i>little bundles of light
that can actually trigger</i>

51:46.402 --> 51:49.929
a high-tech, state-of-the-art
security device.

51:50.005 --> 51:53.031
Bobby... please.

51:54.711 --> 51:55.711
So?

51:55.745 --> 51:58.145
Whats the matter
with it?

51:58.214 --> 52:00.114
Pbht! Nothin'!
Thats the beauty of it.

52:00.183 --> 52:03.243
Now, Mr. P., could I just have your
attention this way, please, sir?

52:04.421 --> 52:06.582
Please, Mr. P.,
come this way.

52:09.559 --> 52:11.960
Ohh.

52:12.029 --> 52:13.359
Oooh.

52:13.430 --> 52:16.058
Space-age plastics
at work for you, Mr. P.

52:16.132 --> 52:19.000
Its invisible, tasteless,
odorless, colorless.

52:19.070 --> 52:23.632
And the best news yet, sir...
its bulletproof.

52:23.708 --> 52:25.869
Bobby, if you... please!

52:28.412 --> 52:29.572
No!

52:43.095 --> 52:46.223
Uhhhh.

52:46.298 --> 52:47.390
Uh, y...

52:47.466 --> 52:49.058
Its got a few bugs
there, Mr. P.,

52:49.134 --> 52:50.761
but you get
the basic idea, right?

52:53.372 --> 52:54.930
Help me get this off
of him.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.804
Mr. P.'s a very rich
and busy man.

52:58.644 --> 53:00.270
<i>Ernest: 24 hours, Lyle.</i>

53:00.345 --> 53:04.282
I'm outta here in 24 hours,
and, boy, am I ever glad.

53:04.350 --> 53:08.013
This hasn't been
a really bad experience, though.

53:08.087 --> 53:09.918
I mean, the food's good,

53:09.989 --> 53:12.480
and I met a lot
of new friends.

53:12.558 --> 53:16.221
<i>But now I'm ready to go back
to my job and my dog.</i>

53:16.295 --> 53:18.058
You know, I got a feeling

53:18.131 --> 53:21.727
everything's gonna turn out
all right from now on.

53:23.536 --> 53:27.667
You know, Lyle, its really
good to be alive.

53:33.614 --> 53:36.981
Whats bothering him?

53:39.720 --> 53:41.813
Ernest,
I can't believe this.

53:41.889 --> 53:43.619
This place is spotless.

53:43.691 --> 53:45.283
I am so proud of you.

53:45.360 --> 53:48.021
Has the value of pride
diminished?

53:48.095 --> 53:49.392
What?

53:49.463 --> 53:52.433
Well, the last time
you were proud of me,

53:52.500 --> 53:53.831
I got a kiss.

53:58.040 --> 54:03.477
<i>Mr. Pendlesmythe: Ernest, I
want to see you in my office.</i>

54:08.717 --> 54:11.014
Well, Ernest, you've made
a drastic improvement

54:11.085 --> 54:12.712
in your job performance.

54:12.787 --> 54:15.222
And so I've decided to take
Miss Sparrow's recommendation.

54:15.291 --> 54:17.691
You'll be joining us
working days as a bank clerk.

54:17.760 --> 54:21.356
<i>So, Ernest, do you have
anything to say?</i>

54:23.232 --> 54:26.690
<i>Mr. Pendlesmythe: You idiot!
You smashed my golf trophy!</i>

54:26.769 --> 54:27.861
<i>Get out of here!</i>

54:27.937 --> 54:29.166
Gosh, Mr. Pendlesmythe,

54:29.239 --> 54:31.230
does this mean
I don't get the job?

54:31.308 --> 54:35.334
"Don't get the job"?
I may have you shot!

54:39.449 --> 54:40.381
Ernest...

54:40.450 --> 54:41.678
Did you see his face?

54:41.751 --> 54:43.946
You didn't do that
on purpose?

54:44.020 --> 54:45.283
He'll get over it.

54:45.356 --> 54:47.721
Ernest, what has gotten
into you?

54:47.791 --> 54:49.224
Look, we got to talk.

54:49.292 --> 54:52.126
Okay.
How 'bout tonight?

54:52.196 --> 54:55.256
But itll have to be
early.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.392
Why?
You have a lot to clean?

54:57.468 --> 54:58.661
Yeah.

54:58.735 --> 55:02.001
Tonight I'm gonna clean out
the whole place.

55:06.644 --> 55:10.239
<i>Man: Open C-12.</i>

55:16.021 --> 55:19.388
<i>Warden: Nash, your lawyer's
got something to tell you.</i>

55:19.458 --> 55:21.652
I'm afraid I've got
some bad news, Mr. Nash.

55:21.726 --> 55:23.388
Our last appeal
was turned down.

55:23.462 --> 55:25.225
<i>It was our final hope.</i>

55:25.297 --> 55:28.733
<i>I'm afraid there's nothing
more we can do.</i>

55:28.800 --> 55:30.894
Come on, Nash.
Lets go.

55:30.970 --> 55:32.096
Go? Go where?

55:32.171 --> 55:33.467
You're going to the row.

55:33.539 --> 55:35.234
The row?
Well, whats that?

55:35.307 --> 55:38.641
As in death.
You know, death row.

55:38.711 --> 55:40.804
Oh, well...
death row?!

55:40.880 --> 55:43.849
You mean like the chair?
The hot seat?

55:43.917 --> 55:45.908
Dead meat, deep six,
its over, pal,

55:45.985 --> 55:47.282
you're outta here, bub,

55:47.353 --> 55:49.344
the groundhogs are bringing
your mail,

55:49.422 --> 55:51.356
you're picking turnips
with a stepladder,

55:51.424 --> 55:54.588
like the no-tomorrow row,
that kind of row?

55:54.662 --> 55:57.391
Oh, no. The row?!
Uh, but, uh...

55:57.463 --> 55:59.556
You've got to tell them
who I am, fellas.

55:59.632 --> 56:01.999
<i>I'm Ernest P. Worrell.
I'm not Nash.</i>

56:02.069 --> 56:03.195
I'm Ernest.

56:03.270 --> 56:05.830
<i>Zip it up, Nash.
Get him outta here.</i>

56:05.906 --> 56:07.806
Warden, you're gonna feel
terrible

56:07.875 --> 56:09.319
<i>when you find out what
a big mistake you made.</i>

56:09.343 --> 56:12.210
And, you, pal, you're not
getting any more of my business.

56:12.279 --> 56:14.110
I'm not Nash, I tell you.
I'm Ernest.

56:14.181 --> 56:17.174
<i>I'm Ernest P. Worrell.</i>

56:17.252 --> 56:19.447
<i>Close "C" block.</i>

56:20.988 --> 56:22.979
Come in.

56:23.057 --> 56:27.051
<i>♪ Two hearts
racing toward love... ♪</i>

56:34.169 --> 56:37.366
<i>♪ Two lips trembling... ♪</i>

56:37.439 --> 56:39.498
Ernest, this
wasn't what I expected.

56:39.574 --> 56:42.476
Its, um,
I-its different.

56:42.545 --> 56:44.273
Have a drink.

56:44.346 --> 56:47.544
Oh. Okay, sure.
Why not?

56:47.617 --> 56:50.814
Uh, sit down. Make yourself
more comfortable.

56:50.886 --> 56:54.344
<i>♪... Burning in the night... ♪</i>

56:54.423 --> 56:57.881
A toast... to
the successful completion

56:57.960 --> 57:00.758
<i>of all
of tonights endeavors.</i>

57:00.830 --> 57:04.096
To a long and happy life.

57:04.167 --> 57:05.464
I'm up for that.

57:05.535 --> 57:07.264
Um, Ernest, I-I didn't
come here to have...

57:07.337 --> 57:09.270
I was... just wanted
to speak to you

57:09.338 --> 57:11.364
about what happened
at the bank today.

57:11.441 --> 57:13.170
We can talk later.

57:13.243 --> 57:14.175
Ernest.

57:14.244 --> 57:15.836
Ernest, stop it!

57:15.912 --> 57:17.174
<i>What has
gotten into you?!</i>

57:17.247 --> 57:18.408
<i>Stop it!</i>

57:18.483 --> 57:19.710
Get off me!

57:23.086 --> 57:27.023
<i>Get away from me,
you mangy little mutt!</i>

57:27.091 --> 57:31.823
You are slimers,
P. Worrell!

57:37.635 --> 57:40.035
Here,
you little rat ball.

57:53.619 --> 57:57.578
So its come to this.

57:57.656 --> 58:04.357
A pointless, miserable end
to a shallow, meaningless life.

58:04.430 --> 58:07.263
But its as it should be.

58:07.332 --> 58:10.631
Its the hand I've been dealt,

58:10.703 --> 58:14.697
and I have to play it
as it lays.

58:14.774 --> 58:16.071
Oh, I'm not going to cry

58:16.142 --> 58:18.042
because life's thrown me
a curve.

58:18.110 --> 58:23.014
I'm... I'm not going to whine
because I got mashed potatoes

58:23.083 --> 58:27.144
when French fries
is what I really wanted.

58:27.220 --> 58:32.248
Its time for me to...
step up to the plate,

58:32.325 --> 58:34.816
belly up to the bar!

58:34.894 --> 58:40.663
Its time for me to look fate
square in the eye,

58:40.735 --> 58:45.365
flare my nostrils,
breathe life's last breath!

58:45.439 --> 58:49.500
Its time for me to lie down
with lions

58:49.577 --> 58:52.513
so I can soar with the eagles!

58:52.581 --> 58:53.842
All right!

58:53.914 --> 58:55.211
I'm ready!

58:55.282 --> 58:57.079
Come and get me!

58:57.151 --> 58:58.619
Lets do it!

58:58.687 --> 59:01.656
Come on, Nash.
Its time.

59:01.723 --> 59:07.593
I don't wanna die.

59:36.859 --> 59:38.020
Is it fixed yet?

59:38.095 --> 59:39.095
No.

59:39.129 --> 59:40.391
Would you like
a cigarette

59:40.464 --> 59:42.454
or a blindfold
or something?

59:42.532 --> 59:47.061
No, I'm afraid of the dark,
and cigarettes will kill you.

59:49.173 --> 59:51.141
Maybe a few last words.

59:51.208 --> 59:53.972
<i>Nash,
take it like a man.</i>

59:54.044 --> 59:57.343
But I'm not Nash.
I'm Ernest.

01:00:00.117 --> 01:00:04.054
"And what is an Ernest?"
You might ask.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:09.185
A man with a past rich in both
history and tradition.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:14.664
<i>Should we punish this man
for crimes he did not commit?</i>

01:00:14.732 --> 01:00:17.030
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00:17.101 --> 01:00:18.659
Can't you
speed things up?

01:00:18.736 --> 01:00:20.101
Okay, okay.

01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:23.835
Such a man should be
set... free.

01:00:47.634 --> 01:00:48.634
Oh!

01:00:55.942 --> 01:00:57.034
Hit the alarm!

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:58.236
<i>Run for it!</i>

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:00.913
<i>Lets go!</i>

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:09.449
<i>Whats wrong
with the door?!</i>

01:01:09.522 --> 01:01:11.957
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:01:12.026 --> 01:01:13.926
<i>Thanks, Nash!</i>

01:01:20.368 --> 01:01:22.199
<i>Man: There's been a breach
in security.</i>

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.898
<i>All guards
to your emergency stations.</i>

01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:28.408
Hey, whats going on
here?!

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:31.707
<i>All prisoners,
return to your cells.</i>

01:01:31.779 --> 01:01:33.179
<i>Return to your...</i>

01:01:33.248 --> 01:01:35.842
Lets go, Lyle.

01:01:35.918 --> 01:01:38.818
Get outta my way!

01:01:38.886 --> 01:01:39.944
There he is!

01:01:40.021 --> 01:01:42.456
<i>Stop him! Fire!</i>

01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:44.617
All: Aaahhhhh!

01:01:44.693 --> 01:01:45.751
<i>Come on!
Get outta here!</i>

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.795
Come on!
Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!

01:02:08.084 --> 01:02:09.517
Cut him down now!

01:02:09.585 --> 01:02:12.487
It worked before.

01:02:12.556 --> 01:02:15.149
All: Aaahh!

01:02:19.129 --> 01:02:20.790
Ahh!

01:02:23.467 --> 01:02:25.730
Diii-ha!

01:02:26.971 --> 01:02:28.336
Yihaw! Yihaw!

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.970
Yiiiihaww!
Yihaw!

01:02:32.042 --> 01:02:33.134
Ahh!

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.974
Open sesame.

01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:41.583
Not so fast.

01:02:41.652 --> 01:02:43.553
You better watch out,
Rubin.

01:02:43.621 --> 01:02:44.553
I'll zot you.

01:02:44.622 --> 01:02:46.590
You're a dead man,
Worrell.

01:02:46.658 --> 01:02:48.922
Very well.
You asked for it.

01:02:48.994 --> 01:02:54.159
After all, I am
Ernest P. Worrell, Electroman.

01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:13.214
Did I ever tell you

01:03:13.285 --> 01:03:16.277
that you have a really
classic Greek profile?

01:03:16.355 --> 01:03:17.686
Shut up.

01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:20.122
Let him go.

01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:24.061
Lyle, you talk.
Thats great.

01:03:24.131 --> 01:03:25.825
Have you flipped?
Come on.

01:03:25.898 --> 01:03:29.096
We got to get rid of this guy
before he blows the whole thing.

01:03:29.169 --> 01:03:31.034
No, he's different
than us.

01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:33.971
Shut up and get out
of my way.

01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:35.474
You better go.

01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:39.478
Mr. Nash is probably
robbing the bank right now.

01:03:39.546 --> 01:03:40.808
Nash?

01:03:40.881 --> 01:03:42.906
Well, come with me.

01:03:42.983 --> 01:03:45.009
I don't belong out there.

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:46.883
I got a place in here.

01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:49.945
Well, I'm gonna miss you,
good buddy.

01:03:50.023 --> 01:03:53.289
Ernest, things won't be
the same without you,

01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:54.885
you know what I mean?

01:03:54.962 --> 01:03:57.487
If anybody does...

01:03:58.866 --> 01:04:02.632
So long, Lyle!
I'll send you a cake!

01:04:02.703 --> 01:04:04.102
<i>There he is!</i>

01:04:05.973 --> 01:04:06.973
Come on!

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:09.442
All right!
We got ya!

01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:11.502
<i>Come on, Lyle.
Back inside.</i>

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.137
Don't let him get away.

01:04:13.214 --> 01:04:14.944
<i>Get the dogs!
Come on!</i>

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.416
<i>Move it!</i>

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.079
Nobody has ever escaped
from this facility

01:04:19.154 --> 01:04:20.519
since I've been warden,

01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:22.649
and they're not gonna
start now.

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:24.214
All right, lets go, men.

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:26.955
Consider the prisoner
extremely dangerous.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:38.134
What are you doing now,
Ernest?

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.338
Thats it.

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:48.441
Is everyone who works here
a moron?

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:51.112
<i>Can't you see
what I'm doing?</i>

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.620
I'm robbing the bank.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:56.592
I'm gonna blow the safe,
take the money, and leave.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.287
I'm robbing the bank.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:02.355
I'm stealing the money
that you are paid to protect.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:06.065
I'm robbing the bank.

01:05:06.137 --> 01:05:09.972
Ppbbhhtt!

01:05:33.466 --> 01:05:36.730
<i>I've been vandalized...</i>

01:05:36.801 --> 01:05:39.429
by Elvis.

01:05:39.505 --> 01:05:42.099
<i>I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!</i>

01:05:42.175 --> 01:05:43.836
First Ernest and now this!

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:47.003
I am acting like
the victim again.

01:05:47.078 --> 01:05:50.173
I need to tell Ernest
exactly how I feel,

01:05:50.249 --> 01:05:53.946
<i>and I need to do it right now
while I'm still mad!</i>

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.215
Ah.

01:05:55.289 --> 01:05:57.848
Thats better.

01:05:59.091 --> 01:06:01.423
Rimshot. Rimshot.
Here, boy.

01:06:02.663 --> 01:06:04.130
Rimshot? Rimshot.

01:06:04.198 --> 01:06:06.291
Rimshot?

01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:14.206
Rimshot?

01:06:16.043 --> 01:06:17.772
Rimshot?

01:06:17.844 --> 01:06:19.403
<i>Rimshot.</i>

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.777
Rimshot!

01:06:20.848 --> 01:06:23.907
How did you get in there?

01:06:23.984 --> 01:06:29.480
What kind of a person would
throw away a perfectly good dog?

01:06:29.557 --> 01:06:32.390
Come on, Rimshot.
Lets go.

01:06:53.983 --> 01:06:56.474
<i>Don't you worry
about your diet, chubby.</i>

01:06:59.655 --> 01:07:01.145
As soon as I set this fuse,

01:07:01.223 --> 01:07:04.215
<i>you're gonna lose
all that weight.</i>

01:07:12.802 --> 01:07:14.963
Mr. Pendlesmythe,
its Charlotte.

01:07:15.038 --> 01:07:16.869
I-I know
you won't believe this,

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.739
but it looks like Ernest
is robbing the bank.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:22.004
I know,
but I am here right now.

01:07:34.224 --> 01:07:36.216
Look, I don't know
whats gotten into you,

01:07:36.294 --> 01:07:38.023
but you can't go through
with this!

01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:39.027
Ernest! Ernest!

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:40.222
Look...

01:07:40.298 --> 01:07:41.925
I am not this Ernest guy.

01:07:41.999 --> 01:07:44.194
I just happen
to look like him.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:46.498
I switched with him,
you get it?

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.832
You what?

01:07:47.905 --> 01:07:49.304
Look,
would the real Ernest

01:07:49.373 --> 01:07:51.274
have been able
to knock out Chuck

01:07:51.343 --> 01:07:54.039
or set a time bomb without it
going off in his face?

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:55.340
And look at the floors.

01:07:55.414 --> 01:07:57.847
Did you notice how clean
they've been lately?

01:07:57.915 --> 01:07:59.747
<i>You are an imposter.</i>

01:07:59.818 --> 01:08:03.254
What did you do
with the real Ernest?

01:08:03.322 --> 01:08:04.550
Where is he?

01:08:04.623 --> 01:08:05.681
He's dead by now.

01:08:05.757 --> 01:08:07.350
<i>What do you mean
he's dead?</i>

01:08:07.426 --> 01:08:09.792
I don't believe you!
What have you done with him?!

01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:11.522
I haven't done anything
with him.

01:08:11.596 --> 01:08:14.157
Your dedicated public servants
down in the state pen

01:08:14.233 --> 01:08:16.029
put him in the chair
hours ago.

01:08:16.102 --> 01:08:20.401
Well, I'll be seeing you,
sweetheart.

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:24.238
<i>Or rather, I'll be seeing
parts of you.</i>

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:25.537
<i>Ha ha ha ha.</i>

01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:29.776
<i>Parts of you...
ha ha ha ha ha!</i>

01:08:42.595 --> 01:08:45.656
Shh. Rimshot,
don't say a word.

01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:56.609
Uh... uh.

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:58.474
Charlie!

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:03.314
Ow!

01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:04.528
<i>Chuck: Thats it.
Get him in position.</i>

01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:06.484
<i>Ow! Chuck!</i>

01:09:06.553 --> 01:09:08.283
Ow!

01:09:08.356 --> 01:09:10.881
Whats gotten into you,
Chuck? Its me! Ow!

01:09:10.959 --> 01:09:14.122
You sure have a funny way
of saying hello.

01:09:14.194 --> 01:09:15.857
Do you think I'd let you
get near me

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.398
after what you did
to Ernest...

01:09:17.466 --> 01:09:19.591
one of the sweetest,
kindest men who ever lived?

01:09:21.403 --> 01:09:24.134
Gosh, Charlotte,
I-I'm touched.

01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:29.307
Okay, now, listen to me.

01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:30.777
When I give the signal,

01:09:30.845 --> 01:09:33.337
I want you to hit him
with everything we've got.

01:09:33.416 --> 01:09:34.348
What?

01:09:34.417 --> 01:09:35.975
Sir, we got civilians
in there.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:41.680
Worrell.

01:09:41.756 --> 01:09:44.020
Nash.

01:09:47.063 --> 01:09:50.624
Now, Nash, this is Warden Carmichael.
Now, we've got you surrounded.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.600
Come on out with your hands up.

01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:55.968
Nash, let the hostages go.

01:09:56.039 --> 01:09:58.906
Looks like I got myself
another hostage.

01:09:58.975 --> 01:10:02.969
Too bad.
I thought you were dead.

01:10:03.047 --> 01:10:04.309
Not yet.

01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:07.179
So... it comes to this.

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:10.982
Man to man,
mano a mano,

01:10:11.055 --> 01:10:13.319
<i>toe to toe,
nose to nose,</i>

01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:18.385
<i>shirts and skins,
eggs over medium.</i>

01:10:18.463 --> 01:10:19.862
Be careful, Ernest!

01:10:20.398 --> 01:10:21.456
Ohh!

01:10:22.066 --> 01:10:23.124
<i>Chuck:
He should've ducked.</i>

01:10:23.201 --> 01:10:24.691
Here, let me help you up.

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:26.965
I want to show you
your new desk.

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.571
Stop it!

01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:33.133
<i>- Get up.
- Chuck: Yeah, stop it!</i>

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:37.213
I can't believe I was
fooled by that man.

01:10:37.282 --> 01:10:38.715
I sensed it immediately.

01:10:40.886 --> 01:10:43.150
<i>Freeze, punk.</i>

01:10:43.222 --> 01:10:45.383
Make your play.

01:10:45.457 --> 01:10:47.425
<i>Chuck: All right, Bobby!
Burn him!</i>

01:11:06.312 --> 01:11:09.076
<i>What are you waiting for?!
Burn him!</i>

01:11:13.254 --> 01:11:14.915
<i>Bobby!</i>

01:11:14.989 --> 01:11:16.512
<i>Bobby!</i>

01:11:16.589 --> 01:11:17.613
<i>The gun!</i>

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:22.286
Get away from there.

01:11:26.033 --> 01:11:29.298
<i>Nash: Give me that gun
or I'll rip your lungs out.</i>

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.564
<i>Give it here!</i>

01:11:30.638 --> 01:11:32.037
<i>Chuck:
Bobby, go to plan 12!</i>

01:11:32.106 --> 01:11:34.974
<i>Let go!</i>

01:11:35.443 --> 01:11:36.569
Let go.

01:11:36.645 --> 01:11:38.613
<i>Ohhh.</i>

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.477
<i>Warden: You haven't got
a prayer, Nash.</i>

01:11:41.549 --> 01:11:43.313
<i>You're completely surrounded.
Give it up.</i>

01:11:43.385 --> 01:11:45.683
<i>Chuck: Bobby!</i>

01:11:47.556 --> 01:11:48.784
What do you want me
to do now?

01:11:48.857 --> 01:11:50.155
Deploy them around
to the back.

01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:51.453
Okay, second team,
lets move.

01:11:51.526 --> 01:11:52.618
<i>You heard him!
Lets go!</i>

01:11:53.795 --> 01:11:54.795
Toast time.

01:12:09.712 --> 01:12:12.180
It looks like one way
or another,

01:12:12.248 --> 01:12:14.444
this was just his night to fry.

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:31.998
<i>I'm floating.</i>

01:12:32.069 --> 01:12:33.195
<i>I'm lighter than air.</i>

01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:35.363
Whats happening to me?

01:12:35.439 --> 01:12:38.000
He's polarized.
He... he's weightless.

01:12:38.076 --> 01:12:39.633
<i>Gravity's lost its grip.</i>

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:42.042
I'll show you polarized.

01:12:42.112 --> 01:12:43.671
Ahhhhhhhh!

01:12:43.748 --> 01:12:46.683
<i>- Time to put your butt on spin cycle.
- Ahhhhhhh!</i>

01:12:48.987 --> 01:12:51.113
<i>Ahhhhhhhhhh!</i>

01:12:51.188 --> 01:12:53.316
<i>Right down the middle.</i>

01:12:58.196 --> 01:12:59.664
Ahhhhh!

01:13:00.299 --> 01:13:03.392
Ahhhhhhh!
Oh, no! No! No! No!

01:13:03.468 --> 01:13:04.468
Ugh!

01:13:05.436 --> 01:13:06.436
Ugh!

01:13:06.504 --> 01:13:07.699
Chuck! Bob...!
Chuck! Bob...!

01:13:07.773 --> 01:13:09.172
<i>- Stop it!
- Doh!</i>

01:13:11.477 --> 01:13:12.876
Uhhhhh!

01:13:12.945 --> 01:13:13.945
Oh!

01:13:15.514 --> 01:13:16.514
Uhhhhh!

01:13:18.784 --> 01:13:19.784
Oh!

01:13:20.285 --> 01:13:21.285
Oh!

01:13:21.587 --> 01:13:22.587
Ow!

01:13:22.989 --> 01:13:23.989
Oh!

01:13:24.724 --> 01:13:26.315
<i>Nash: To the moon,
bozo!</i>

01:13:26.392 --> 01:13:27.757
Leave him alone!

01:13:27.826 --> 01:13:29.054
Uh!

01:13:29.128 --> 01:13:30.892
<i>Chuck:
Ernest, you're in control!</i>

01:13:30.964 --> 01:13:32.932
<i>Thats it!</i>

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.528
Nash, listen to me.
Let the hostages go.

01:13:36.603 --> 01:13:39.367
Yeah, right, warden.
This'll take care of him.

01:13:39.439 --> 01:13:40.906
<i>Ernest, incoming.</i>

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:45.742
<i>3:00. Maybe 2:30.</i>

01:13:46.447 --> 01:13:48.108
<i>50... 3/4...</i>

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:52.551
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:13:52.619 --> 01:13:55.953
Ahhhhhhh!

01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:02.190
<i>Wa-ahhhhhhhh!</i>

01:14:03.664 --> 01:14:05.291
Get this thing
off of me.

01:14:05.366 --> 01:14:07.027
Watch out, Ernest!
He's getting up!

01:14:07.101 --> 01:14:09.434
<i>Aaaahhhhhh!</i>

01:14:09.504 --> 01:14:11.404
<i>Chuck:
Ernest, grab the lamp!</i>

01:14:11.473 --> 01:14:13.838
<i>Be careful.
Those lamps are expensive.</i>

01:14:16.611 --> 01:14:18.442
<i>Go back to plan "B."</i>

01:14:19.514 --> 01:14:21.277
I'm gonna kill him.

01:14:21.349 --> 01:14:22.349
Ahh!

01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:24.575
Huh?

01:14:24.653 --> 01:14:26.143
W-Whats going on
in there?

01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:28.212
Get your head down!
Who is this guy?

01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:29.450
Its my bank.

01:14:29.524 --> 01:14:32.221
Peter Pan,
eat your heart out.

01:14:35.965 --> 01:14:38.558
Here. Have a seat.

01:14:40.002 --> 01:14:41.002
Ahhhhhh!

01:14:45.708 --> 01:14:46.903
Ugh!

01:14:47.678 --> 01:14:49.668
Ahhhhhhhhh!

01:14:51.414 --> 01:14:54.406
<i>Ernest: Let go of me!</i>

01:14:54.484 --> 01:14:55.543
Pull on it!

01:14:55.619 --> 01:14:57.143
Pull on it! Chuck!

01:14:57.221 --> 01:14:58.153
I am.

01:14:58.222 --> 01:15:00.655
My wrist is beginning
to chafe.

01:15:00.723 --> 01:15:02.247
<i>Ernest!</i>

01:15:03.227 --> 01:15:05.695
Stop this thing!
Somebody, stop...

01:15:09.233 --> 01:15:12.202
<i>Nash: Come on, get me
off of this thing!</i>

01:15:14.204 --> 01:15:17.196
<i>Hey, Nash, you'll never get him
now.</i>

01:15:17.274 --> 01:15:20.244
Please be sure that your
seat backs and tray tables

01:15:20.311 --> 01:15:23.711
are in their full, upright, and
locked positions before landing.

01:15:23.781 --> 01:15:25.180
<i>Let me
off of this thing!</i>

01:15:25.249 --> 01:15:27.128
Thanks for shopping with us.
Ah heh heh heh heh.

01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:29.313
<i>No, don't touch
that button.</i>

01:15:29.387 --> 01:15:30.149
No!

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.848
Aaaahhhhh!

01:15:33.057 --> 01:15:34.057
All right!

01:15:35.593 --> 01:15:38.153
E-e-e-e-e-w.

01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:41.393
15 seconds, Chuck!

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:48.806
Bobby, unlock me!

01:15:48.874 --> 01:15:50.501
Ernest, the bomb!

01:15:50.576 --> 01:15:52.510
I'm coming.

01:15:52.578 --> 01:15:54.055
<i>Don't worry, Charlotte.
I'll save you.</i>

01:15:54.079 --> 01:15:55.478
<i>Give me that.</i>

01:15:55.548 --> 01:15:59.746
<i>Up, up, and away-y-y-y-y-y!</i>

01:16:07.661 --> 01:16:09.891
He's getting away.

01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:15.226
Whoa!

01:16:15.302 --> 01:16:16.530
Wow!

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:31.945
Oh... my buddy's gone.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.391
<i>He's been here all right.</i>

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.195
I recognize his work.

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:49.429
Ernest saved us,
Mr. Pendlesmythe.

01:16:49.503 --> 01:16:52.564
<i>He saved your stupid bank
and all your stupid money.</i>

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.233
Ernest wasn't a thief.
He was a hero.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.079
Well, maybe you're right.

01:16:58.146 --> 01:16:59.146
Stick a sock in it.

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:00.273
Unh.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:03.682
Put 'em down, boys.
Nice and easy.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:07.621
And all of you, move over there.
Come on, move.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:09.055
Nash...

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.092
you'll never get away
with this.

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:13.286
Oh, yeah, warden?
I think so.

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:16.799
She's my ticket outta here.
Come over here, sweetie.

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:18.390
<i>Ahhhhhhh!</i>

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:25.797
Uhhhh. Uh-oh.

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:28.804
Ernest, you're alive.

01:17:33.283 --> 01:17:37.277
I came. I saw.

01:17:37.354 --> 01:17:40.551
I got blowed up.

01:18:02.113 --> 01:18:04.104
Play it, Sam.

01:18:04.182 --> 01:18:06.150
The piano will cover up
the shot.
