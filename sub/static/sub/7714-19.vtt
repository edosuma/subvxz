19:44.266 --> 19:47.560
Dwight recently entered

Angela.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.355
Did he not tell you that?
What?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.691
You're really putting me
in an awkward position here.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.610
Do you plan on
raising a child with me,

19:55.694 --> 19:57.361
or do you plan on
breaking this contract?

19:57.446 --> 19:59.030

and they wouldn't give
me a refill.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.054

20:23.138 --> 20:24.388

20:28.393 --> 20:30.895
Sort of did okay
with a new young lady.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.146
Actually you didn't.
Not at all.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.774
l think l did,
but l can't take
all the credit.

20:34.858 --> 20:38.819
Some of the credit is due,
in fact, to my good friend
Date Mike.
