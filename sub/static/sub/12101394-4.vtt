04:53.544 --> 04:55.546
she sent me videos

04:55.629 --> 04:57.881
of what's really going on
outside our homes.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.802
-ZEN: Sasha, those videos
are from 20 years ago.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.514
-No, I remember.
I was 23 when it invaded.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.934
I was young with
so many plans.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.353
And there was no end in sight.

05:11.437 --> 05:14.565
Every day was a nightmare
you couldn't wake up from.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.316
Day and night,
night and day.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.444
The same horror,

05:18.527 --> 05:22.656
just less people alive
to agonize over it.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.784
Friends and
friends of friends gone.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.623
Family. Enemies.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.250
Gone.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.544
And all anybody could think
was the same thought:

05:35.627 --> 05:38.881
Oh, thank God it wasn't me.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.717
I hope I'm not next.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.260
And I knew...

05:43.343 --> 05:47.765
I knew my life as I had
once enjoyed it was over.

05:47.848 --> 05:52.144
My existence was divided into
two chapters now:

05:52.227 --> 05:56.648
Before the Stay and
everything that happened after.

05:56.732 --> 06:02.529
Two chapters divided by
one noiseless disaster,

06:02.613 --> 06:04.656
and I changed.

06:04.740 --> 06:09.286
I no longer, in your words,
longed for the outside world.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.456
I no longer desired my life
be returned to me

06:12.539 --> 06:14.750
in the mint condition
in which I'd used it.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.543
I knew that was
an impossibility.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.671
So, I emptied my bank account,
I paid the powers that be,

06:19.755 --> 06:22.800
I got back on that bus
and I was delivered here

06:22.883 --> 06:25.928
to my Stay Home
to wait it out.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.890
And I made
the perfect dream home.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.643
Open floor plan.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.522
Washable furniture,
huge farm house kitchen,

06:36.605 --> 06:39.191
and light.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.652
Floor to ceiling windows.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.446
And you, of course,
my Zen companion,

06:44.530 --> 06:46.406
as mandated.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.035
But there's no pool.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.872
I always wanted a pool.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.874
I was gonna build one.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.085
Now, Nia...

06:58.168 --> 07:00.003
she had a pool
when we were growing up.

07:00.087 --> 07:04.091
It was above ground,
but still nice.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.468
Her parents would invite
all the kids

07:06.552 --> 07:10.347
in the neighborhood over
to swim in it any time.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.810
We could just lift the latch
on the backyard gates

07:14.893 --> 07:17.855
and go in even if
they weren't home,

07:17.938 --> 07:21.733
made it feel like a...
community pool.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.360
Which is nice of them,
I guess.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.486
No.

07:25.737 --> 07:26.780
It was.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.159
It was.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.831
Me and Nia.

and her knowing I was there,

07:55.517 --> 07:57.352

07:57.436 --> 08:00.397
like it was okay in space
to be alone.

You're gonna say,
"Oh, we would never do that."

Your bosses have the capability

08:39.019 --> 08:41.813
every financial
and political motive.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.857
I read, Zen.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.986
A lot.

08:48.070 --> 08:51.365
And the powers that be

08:51.448 --> 08:52.824

they call them.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.454
[scoffs]
Survival of the fittest.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.830
Ever heard of herd immunity?

08:58.914 --> 09:00.290

you're going to say.

09:00.374 --> 09:04.086
"Oh, that's in the past.
We would never do that today."

09:04.169 --> 09:06.046
Right.
-We wouldn't.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.381
Our only commitment

09:07.464 --> 09:08.632
is to bettering
the lives of our users.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.051
You can trust me, Sasha.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.469
-The way you talk.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.179
The level of your...

09:16.932 --> 09:18.809
You don't have
an anxious voice.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.896
No paranoia in your cadence.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.439
Those of us who...

09:26.817 --> 09:28.360
We have...

09:31.530 --> 09:34.241
You can't know
what we've been through.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.492
How it all started.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.203
The day your bosses
locked us all in.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.539
-They locked you in to
protect you from the virus.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.374
Sasha, please.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.501
It can be traumatic
to recall that day.

09:45.836 --> 09:50.590
-That day, I wake up
I do my hygiene,

09:50.674 --> 09:53.385
and I try the door.

09:53.468 --> 09:57.806
I turn it, twist it, yank it,
pull it, nothing works.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.559
And trying not to panic,
I go to the windows,

10:00.642 --> 10:02.644
and all of them are sealed,

10:02.728 --> 10:04.521
and I immediately
think of Nia,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.523
and I wonder if
she's locked in, too.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.942
And all I did was
think about her.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.862
I thought about her smile,
and the pool, and us floating,

10:11.945 --> 10:13.947
and us...

10:14.031 --> 10:19.328
And she appeared
on that screen.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.082
Screaming.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.293
I couldn't even hear
my own shrieks anymore,

10:26.376 --> 10:27.794
just hers.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.047
And-And I tried to calm her,

10:30.130 --> 10:33.550
I-I tried to remind her of...
of the sprinkler and the pool,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.011
and the summer days
and the light, and us,

10:36.094 --> 10:40.098
and my heart is breaking.

10:40.182 --> 10:44.728
And I... I just want to
pull her into me, you know,

10:44.811 --> 10:46.730
because that's home,
isn't it?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.524
It is for me.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.319
In my friend.

10:54.946 --> 10:58.617
And I... I just want to
try and c... calm her

10:58.700 --> 11:00.285
and pull her in

11:00.369 --> 11:04.289
but instead I start to
synchronize my cries to hers.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.008
Do you know Nia and I
share a birthday?

11:17.344 --> 11:18.387
We do.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.226
Today's her birthday, too.

11:27.062 --> 11:31.441
Yeah, one year
for our ninth one,

11:31.525 --> 11:33.610
she, uh...

11:33.693 --> 11:36.696
she wanted to
teach me how to swim.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.616
I didn't care, I was...

11:39.699 --> 11:41.618

green garden hose.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.412
I didn't want to learn

11:43.495 --> 11:46.623
and, uh...

11:46.706 --> 11:52.629
we were standing there,
her chlorine wrinkled hands

11:52.712 --> 11:57.175
balanced on my nervous body,
and she says,

11:57.259 --> 12:00.971
"To swim...

12:01.054 --> 12:03.181
is to surrender, Sasha."

on that screen...

12:11.773 --> 12:14.359

12:17.070 --> 12:20.991
the last thing I wanted
either of us to do.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.744

the door,

full fist, hard.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.668

irate now and I'm confused,

newly claustrophobic,

12:34.504 --> 12:37.424

to get close to Nia.

12:37.507 --> 12:42.304

in my home!

we can arrange for this.

including James,

14:14.980 --> 14:18.817

left and right,

14:22.153 --> 14:24.489

released to the public

14:24.573 --> 14:26.533

shorter and shorter,

14:26.616 --> 14:28.827
my whole family,
we agreed and said,

14:28.910 --> 14:32.831
okay, we are being lied to.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.376
And your bosses
unlocked all the doors

14:36.459 --> 14:38.837
and said it was safe to
come outside the house

14:38.920 --> 14:40.797
and we believed them.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.175
So my family, we said, okay,
no one leaves their Stay

14:44.259 --> 14:47.178

like, we know,

14:47.262 --> 14:50.932

James' house was on fire.

out of there as fast as you can,

15:25.550 --> 15:29.721
which James did,
but guess what?

15:29.804 --> 15:31.431
It was a mirage.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.935
When he was
three feet off the curb,

15:36.019 --> 15:39.648
all the doors on James' house
locked behind him.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.444
Fire dismissed itself.

When James turned around,
his house was fully intact.

his Stay counselor

15:55.872 --> 15:58.375

16:02.837 --> 16:07.717
He used James' biggest fear,
dying slowly, against him.
