00:23.940 --> 00:26.140
Can I have your attention, please?

00:27.980 --> 00:31.699
We're fortunate to be living
in a time of great progress,

00:31.700 --> 00:34.819
but all too often, advancement comes
at the expense of our heritage.

00:34.820 --> 00:38.899
My brother and I believe the past
is something to be cherished,

00:38.900 --> 00:42.339
Ballarat's past captured forever
for future generations.

00:42.340 --> 00:46.339
I'm delighted to announce Council has
approved the site for development.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.099
You used me!

00:48.100 --> 00:50.459
You bloody Fosters are all the same.

00:50.460 --> 00:53.459
Join us for a drink.
Yeah, I don't want a drink!

00:53.460 --> 00:54.939
Can someone show Mr Young out?

00:54.940 --> 00:57.899
She used me, and you all know it!

00:57.900 --> 01:00.659
This is your fault,
isn't it, Foster?

01:00.660 --> 01:04.138
I'm not finished with you.
Get your hands off me!

01:04.140 --> 01:07.139
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Young's personal issues

01:07.140 --> 01:09.379
have nothing to do with
this glorious development.

01:09.380 --> 01:14.099
So please join me in celebrating
something that is truly historic.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.659
I give you the Foster family's
legacy - Goldrush Park.

02:56.580 --> 02:59.659
Fluids - that's what you need.
You're dehydrated.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.859
Do spirits count?

03:01.860 --> 03:04.099
Only if they're top-shelf.
Always.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.299
Well, nearly always.

03:06.300 --> 03:10.259
Now, any existing conditions
or injuries I need to know about?

03:10.260 --> 03:15.619
No, nothing exciting,
except this old war wound back here.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.379
And where were you serving?

03:17.380 --> 03:18.979
North Africa, 6th Division.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.779
I was in Singapore.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.859
Oh. You would have seen some action,
then.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.739
We both did, by the looks of things.

03:24.740 --> 03:29.699
Yes, well, my wife used to say that
I got shot running the wrong way.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.459
Is that right? She sounds like
a woman of good humour.

03:33.460 --> 03:36.299
She was.
She died nearly two years ago.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.699
I am sorry. Well, part of the reason
for the move here.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.059
Fresh start and all.
Quite.

03:44.060 --> 03:47.899
Do you, um, have any family
or friends in Ballarat?

03:47.900 --> 03:50.819
Not a soul. Not yet, anyway.

03:50.820 --> 03:54.139
There are worse places
for a fresh start.

03:54.140 --> 03:56.379
Now, what is it you do, Mr Carlyle?

03:56.380 --> 03:59.779
Oh, please - call me Frank.
Frank. What is it you do, Frank?

04:01.740 --> 04:04.299
Oh, sorry, Lucien.
That was the police station.

04:04.300 --> 04:07.739
You're wanted at the swimming baths.
Right. Thank you, Jean.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.619
Jean, Mr Frank Carlyle.
Just moved to the area.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.979
Mr Carlyle.
Pleased to meet you, Jean.

04:12.980 --> 04:14.900
Well, we best get going.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.339
Where?
Oh, the swimming baths.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.899
I'm not sure I follow you, Frank.

04:20.899 --> 04:25.180
Well, the truth is,
I'm your new chief superintendent.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.219
Reg Foster.
Yeah. Who's your friend?

04:37.220 --> 04:41.499
Your new boss.
It's Bill Hobart, isn't it?

04:41.500 --> 04:43.779
Frank.
Frank Carlyle?

04:43.780 --> 04:47.619
Yes. Whatever you've heard, it's
a lie, unless it's complimentary.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.139
And you must be...
Simmons, sir.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.500
I fell in, trying to get him out.

04:55.180 --> 04:57.299
So, what have we got?

04:57.300 --> 05:00.499
Ah, Reg Foster's a widower,
big into property.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.779
He's on the front page of the paper
this morning.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.579
Found about two hours ago
by younger brother Noel.

05:05.580 --> 05:08.299
We only got him out to...
Yeah, yeah - to identify him.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.340
It's fine. You did the right thing.

05:11.660 --> 05:15.380
So... where's his brother?

05:17.740 --> 05:20.259
We swam together most mornings.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.900
Was Reg a strong swimmer?

05:24.100 --> 05:27.499
But it helped with his spine.

05:27.500 --> 05:31.260
He had an injury
from when we were young.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.099
It's my fault.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.819
Why would you say that, Noel?

05:35.820 --> 05:40.099
We meet every morning at 6am,
and I was ten minutes late.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.980
I... I could have saved him.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.420
Noel...

05:47.540 --> 05:51.179
...are these Reg's clothes?
Yes.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.700
Right.

05:53.540 --> 05:56.780
We'll need to take them to the morgue
with the body.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.259
His watch stopped.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.780
Right.

06:04.420 --> 06:06.580
'To my sons.'

06:08.100 --> 06:10.779
There's a lot of water in his lungs.

06:10.780 --> 06:12.619
Mm.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.059
Anything else?
The spinal injury.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.539
Yes, but anything else?

06:16.540 --> 06:19.619
Evidence of testicular atrophy.

06:19.620 --> 06:22.780
Duly noted. And what else?

06:24.300 --> 06:26.460
I give up.

06:28.340 --> 06:30.739
His swimming trunks are on
inside out.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.460
Perhaps he dressed in the dark.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.339
There's no external
cranial injuries. I already checked.

06:37.340 --> 06:41.499
Very good. Alice, would you mind
passing me the magnifying glass?

06:41.500 --> 06:43.540
Hands are full.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.940
Right you are.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.740
Now...

06:55.580 --> 06:58.619
...several tufts of hair missing,

06:58.620 --> 07:02.260
and what appears to be dried blood
around the follicles.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.419
Could have happened
when they dragged him out.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.939
True.

07:08.940 --> 07:12.580
Bill Hobart can be
somewhat enthusiastic.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.019
What?

07:23.020 --> 07:25.779
This water's not chlorinated.

07:25.780 --> 07:28.299
So our man didn't drown
at the baths?

07:28.300 --> 07:30.659
He was killed somewhere else
and moved post-mortem.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.419
Alice is testing the diatoms
as we speak.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.779
Diatoms being?
A microorganism present in water.

07:36.780 --> 07:40.539
In theory, it's possible
to confirm the drowning site

07:40.540 --> 07:44.019
by finding a match
with the water in his lungs.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.899
But only in theory?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.579
We'd need...

07:47.580 --> 07:50.219
We'd need samples
from every body of water, every tap,

07:50.220 --> 07:52.419
every damn puddle in Ballarat.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.619
Well, best we requisition
some bottles, then.

07:54.620 --> 07:58.299
Yes. I'll start at the baths -
test the sinks and...

07:58.300 --> 08:00.779
No, no, no.
You're far more valuable with me.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.979
Get one of these blokes
to do the legwork.

08:02.980 --> 08:06.499
Constable Simmons -
you have an affinity for water.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.579
Dr Blake here has a job for you.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.419
We, on the other hand,
will start here -

08:11.420 --> 08:14.260
the last place Reg was seen alive.

08:23.380 --> 08:27.579
Norma, how long have you been
Mr Foster's secretary?

08:27.580 --> 08:29.899
Three years.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.899
He was a gentleman.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.899
I don't know why
anyone would hurt him.

08:34.900 --> 08:38.379
Very organised.
Certainly loved a right angle.

08:38.380 --> 08:43.299
He said that's how he made
his fortune - routine and order.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.619
Were you at the presentation
last night?

08:46.620 --> 08:49.019
No. I'd gone home.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.739
So you weren't there
for Reg's big announcement?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.939
I wasn't feeling well.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.180
If you'll excuse me.

09:00.060 --> 09:03.220
That reminds me - we'll need
a water sample from the bathroom.

09:05.340 --> 09:09.379
How's he financing this
Goldrush Park?

09:09.380 --> 09:12.899
The Fosters are, um,
independently wealthy.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.859
Ah. Get a copy of the will,
see who stands to benefit, then.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.860
There's something not right here,
Frank.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.619
Don't mind me.
Rose Anderson, The Courier.

09:24.620 --> 09:27.059
Chief Superintendent Carlyle.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.819
I'm just taking a few snaps
for Reg Foster's obituary.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.659
How did you hear about all this?

09:31.660 --> 09:33.259
Welcome to Ballarat.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.939
No photographs.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.899
I heard he drowned
in the swimming baths.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.819
Is there more to the story?
There is, isn't there?

09:39.820 --> 09:42.419
Miss Anderson, did you
take this photograph last night?

09:42.420 --> 09:44.419
Valerie Foster called up first thing

09:44.420 --> 09:46.539
to complain about
being cut out of picture.

09:46.540 --> 09:48.739
Reg's wife?
Sister.

09:48.740 --> 09:51.059
I'll need a copy of
all your photographs, if I may,

09:51.060 --> 09:53.299
thank you, Miss Anderson.
Why?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.219
What are you investigating?
Is this a homicide?

09:55.220 --> 09:58.019
I'll need you to leave now,
Miss Anderson. I will do you a deal.

09:58.020 --> 10:01.339
Give me a statement, and I'll tell
you who made a kerfuffle last night.

10:01.340 --> 10:05.699
I'll do YOU a deal -
you tell me everything you know,

10:05.700 --> 10:10.140
and I won't arrest you for
obstructing a police investigation.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.380
Ah, Mr Young?

10:18.940 --> 10:20.580
Yes.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.460
Quick word?

10:24.300 --> 10:26.899
Um, yes. Indeed. Just through here.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.339
Come in.

10:29.340 --> 10:33.060
Look, we just wanted to have a quick
chat about the death of Reg Foster.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.340
OK. Um...

10:37.500 --> 10:40.499
I couldn't hurt anyone - look at me.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.379
Reg Foster was physically impaired.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.539
It wouldn't take much
to do some harm.

10:44.540 --> 10:47.539
And you did threaten him last night
in front of a roomful of people.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.139
First of all, I was angry.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.219
And-And maybe a little plastered.

10:52.220 --> 10:54.780
Why don't you tell us
what he did to you, Lionel?

10:57.780 --> 11:03.020
Valerie Foster and I were together,
at least we tried to be.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.660
Reg was possessive.

11:07.980 --> 11:11.739
He wanted his sister to stay
a spinster, at his beck and call.

11:11.740 --> 11:14.539
He insisted that she ended it.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.219
And he thought I wasn't worthy.

11:16.220 --> 11:17.940
Right. And she did what he wanted?

11:19.540 --> 11:21.180
Go on.

11:22.020 --> 11:24.819
The Fosters were planning
the Goldrush Park development,

11:24.820 --> 11:26.419
and they wanted someone
from the Council onside.

11:26.420 --> 11:29.059
Valerie asked me
to push the approval through -

11:29.060 --> 11:32.619
said that if I did it,
we would win Reg over.

11:32.620 --> 11:35.340
But it didn't work?

11:39.980 --> 11:44.099
As soon as the park was approved,
she ditched me again.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.500
I know Reg was behind it.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.540
They used me.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.019
I fell for it.

11:55.020 --> 11:57.540
Lionel, where's your nearest sink?

11:58.780 --> 12:01.059
You certainly have a way with people.

12:01.060 --> 12:04.659
I have never seen a suspect
offer up his house keys before.

12:04.660 --> 12:08.059
I'll drop you at the morgue so you
can have someone test that sample.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.019
That sink big enough to drown in,
though?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.900
Well, it only takes
a few inches of water.

12:14.140 --> 12:15.899
Oh, while I'm at Lionel's place,

12:15.900 --> 12:18.019
I might send Bill Hobart round
to the Foster house.

12:18.020 --> 12:20.619
He can question Valerie.
I wouldn't mind joining him.

12:20.620 --> 12:26.619
I've heard this is the way you
like to work, which is fine by me.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.580
You keep getting results, I'll keep
letting you do what you want.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.859
Doc? Can we get a move on?

13:09.860 --> 13:11.900
Right you are, Bill.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.260
Oh! Bloody hell.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.380
Murder?

13:26.460 --> 13:30.020
It appears your brother didn't
drown at the pool, Miss Foster.

13:31.820 --> 13:37.180
Yes. Whoever committed the crime
wanted it to look like an accident.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.379
Valerie,
perhaps you should have a seat.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.219
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.180
Are you sure about this?

13:47.300 --> 13:50.819
Is it just you and your brother
who live here, Miss Foster?

13:50.820 --> 13:53.019
What about your younger brother Noel?

13:53.020 --> 13:54.539
Noel has his own house.

13:54.540 --> 13:59.059
I was only staying here temporarily
when I returned from America.

13:59.060 --> 14:02.619
Reg insisted I stay. He got lonely.

14:02.620 --> 14:04.739
Right.

14:04.740 --> 14:07.099
When did you last see Reg?

14:07.100 --> 14:11.259
In his office, after the party.
I stayed to help him clean up.

14:11.260 --> 14:13.539
He couldn't rest until the place
was completely spotless.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.459
Was there anyone else with you?

14:16.460 --> 14:18.739
Did you return home together?
Yes.

14:18.740 --> 14:21.059
And did you notice anyone
following you at any stage

14:21.060 --> 14:23.179
or anyone loitering
outside the office?

14:23.180 --> 14:24.700
No.

14:25.540 --> 14:29.660
And what time did you arrive
back here?

14:30.700 --> 14:34.379
Around 9:00, 9:30.

14:34.380 --> 14:38.099
Reg stayed up to do some reading.
I went straight to bed.

14:38.100 --> 14:43.300
When I woke up this morning,
I received the phone call from Noel.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.380
Reg's bed wasn't even slept in.

14:48.340 --> 14:52.539
Valerie, would you mind terribly
if I had a look around?

14:52.540 --> 14:54.019
No.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.540
Thank you.

15:28.140 --> 15:29.979
What are you doing?

15:29.980 --> 15:31.580
What happened here?

15:34.260 --> 15:36.460
The bath has started leaking.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.540
What a nuisance.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.420
Bill, look here.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.420
Just like his office.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.899
That's why it felt so wrong.

15:55.900 --> 15:59.179
Do you recall how Reg's clothes
were left at the pool?

15:59.180 --> 16:02.339
They were just shoved in the locker.
Yes.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.619
But here, just like his office,

16:04.620 --> 16:08.539
everything is stored and arranged
neatly, impeccably.

16:08.540 --> 16:13.499
So either the killer didn't know Reg
very well, which is doubtful,

16:13.500 --> 16:17.300
or they were in a panic
and not thinking.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.860
Valerie...

16:22.980 --> 16:29.339
...I couldn't help but notice that,
uh... snow globe in the living room.

16:29.340 --> 16:31.419
It's a boule a neige.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.899
Yes.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.979
Statue of Liberty. Is it yours?

16:34.980 --> 16:39.259
Yes, actually. It's a souvenir. I
lived in New York for several years.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.339
Ah.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.340
Wonderful city, New York.

16:44.180 --> 16:46.459
What brought you back to Ballarat?

16:46.460 --> 16:47.980
The weather.

16:50.980 --> 16:53.420
I'll go have a look
at the other rooms, shall I?

17:06.180 --> 17:07.859
One of yours?

17:08.980 --> 17:11.819
Unlike some,
I don't believe in decorating myself

17:11.819 --> 17:14.260
to impress the opposite sex.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.659
Perfume.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.259
Quite strong.

17:24.260 --> 17:28.138
Mm. Sometimes I think
the woman bathes in it.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.299
And what woman might that be?

17:30.300 --> 17:33.019
I told Reg to stay away from her.
She's nothing but a gold-digger.

17:33.020 --> 17:35.900
But she'd flutter her eyelashes, and
he'd be enchanted all over again.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.819
What woman?

17:38.820 --> 17:42.259
She's a vicious,
bitter old spinster.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.579
She's jealous of me.

17:44.580 --> 17:48.059
She's jealous of anyone
who draws attention from her.

17:48.060 --> 17:50.339
Why didn't you tell us
about the relationship before?

17:50.340 --> 17:54.899
Because it was private.
That's how Reg wanted it.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.139
Reg cared more about his
public image than he did about me.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.739
Did that make you angry?

17:59.740 --> 18:01.819
It made me disappointed.

18:01.820 --> 18:04.019
Why weren't you at the party
last night?

18:04.020 --> 18:07.419
I've already told your boss.
I was ill!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.299
And did you see Mr Foster
after that?

18:09.300 --> 18:10.820
No.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.459
Did you part on good terms?

18:13.460 --> 18:14.980
Yes. I...

18:16.940 --> 18:19.859
You're lying. What are you hiding?

18:19.860 --> 18:21.380
Nothing!

18:23.340 --> 18:27.859
You're looking flushed, Norma.
Why don't you sit down for a minute?

18:27.860 --> 18:30.979
Take a couple of good breaths, eh?

18:30.980 --> 18:33.099
How long have you been
feeling unwell?

18:33.100 --> 18:35.580
It's the shock. I'll be fine.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.380
Really?

18:39.500 --> 18:42.300
It's not the shock, though, is it?

18:43.300 --> 18:47.380
Nausea, flushes, slippery pulse?

18:48.980 --> 18:54.220
Old Chinese-medicine technique
for diagnosing pregnancy.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.540
How far gone are you, Norma?

19:01.260 --> 19:03.060
A few months.

19:03.940 --> 19:06.620
Reg Foster's the father, isn't he?

19:08.300 --> 19:10.899
I told him just before the party.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.139
And how did he react?

19:13.140 --> 19:18.220
He just went quiet,
and then he told Valerie.

19:19.220 --> 19:23.419
She accused me
of trying to trap him into marriage,

19:23.420 --> 19:26.459
said he'd never marry
the likes of me.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.899
I tried to talk to him,
but she wouldn't let me near him.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.140
She just sent me home.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.339
Don't go anywhere.

19:37.340 --> 19:40.259
We might need to speak to you again.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.419
A woman scorned.
Bit of a cliche, isn't it?

19:43.420 --> 19:45.979
Norma Emerson is ambitious
and opportunistic.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.899
I wouldn't rule her out just yet.

19:47.900 --> 19:51.299
And I've requested Reg's
medical records from his GP.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.899
There's something I want to check
before we speak with Norma again.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.579
We didn't find anything
incriminating

19:56.580 --> 20:00.459
at Lionel Young's place,
but I managed to get you this.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.460
Excellent.
I'll get that tested first thing.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.459
Ah, Ned.

20:06.460 --> 20:08.579
Here we go, Doc. Got these two.

20:08.580 --> 20:11.899
Oh, Ned. Well done. I've left a few
more at the charge counter as well.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.099
Have them all sent to the morgue
for me, would you?

20:14.100 --> 20:19.099
Ah - and there's this,
from the front of the Foster house.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.379
I hope you didn't waste a good drop.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.819
Which reminds me - having a bit of
a lock-in with the boys.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.539
First day on the job and all that.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.379
You'll be joining us?
Yes.

20:27.380 --> 20:28.899
Yes, I, um...

20:28.900 --> 20:32.379
I'll just phone home first.
Right. Check with the boss.

20:32.380 --> 20:35.499
Oh, and, um, tell Charlie Davis
to show his face.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.739
Ned tells me that he lives with you.

20:37.740 --> 20:40.460
I know he's on sick leave,
but I would like to meet him.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.260
Right you are.

20:48.420 --> 20:51.859
To teamwork, and to solving
this Reg Foster business quickly.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.860
Cheers.
Hear, hear.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.219
So, Davis?

20:58.220 --> 21:01.419
Ah, yes. He's in Melbourne,
visiting his mother.

21:01.420 --> 21:04.139
I think being stuck in a house
on sick leave

21:04.140 --> 21:05.859
has been driving him slightly mad.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.139
That's alright.
There's always next time.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.899
So the wife was OK with you
staying out past your bedtime, then?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.739
Jean's not my wife.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.500
She's... Well, let's just say she...

21:17.540 --> 21:20.659
...she's a great support to me.

21:20.660 --> 21:22.499
I miss that.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.899
Miranda and I were together
nearly 20 years.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.979
Met as teenagers.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.899
Took me a long time
to get my act together.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.900
My one regret was
not marrying her sooner.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.140
Right.

21:41.940 --> 21:44.020
Excuse me, Frank.

21:59.660 --> 22:01.300
Noel?

22:03.580 --> 22:05.820
Mind if I join you?

22:11.740 --> 22:13.900
Tough day, eh?

22:16.220 --> 22:18.660
Do you have anyone
who can help you through this?

22:19.980 --> 22:23.980
Reg and I supported each other
through everything.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.500
He was five when I was born.

22:32.100 --> 22:37.219
My earliest memory is Reg,
always there,

22:37.220 --> 22:39.780
looking after me, protecting me.

22:40.940 --> 22:43.659
What about your sister Valerie?

22:43.660 --> 22:45.139
Mm, Valerie.

22:45.140 --> 22:47.580
Are you close to her?

22:48.580 --> 22:50.979
Valerie's always been independent.

22:50.980 --> 22:52.499
Ah.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.979
She resented us, I suppose,
how close we were.

22:55.980 --> 23:00.979
Reg and I would spend
entire summers together

23:00.980 --> 23:04.299
in the parklands,
out past Wendouree,

23:04.300 --> 23:09.579
building forts,
playing soldiers and miners,

23:09.580 --> 23:11.500
panning for gold.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.979
We never found any.

23:14.980 --> 23:18.820
Is that where the inspiration
came from for Goldrush Park?

23:19.740 --> 23:24.699
We just wanted to capture
those golden days, that magic -

23:24.700 --> 23:29.499
unspoiled parkland, adventure,
history, education.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.019
It would have made
a wonderful legacy.

23:32.020 --> 23:35.459
No reason why it still can't happen.

23:35.460 --> 23:37.500
No. It's tainted now.

23:42.980 --> 23:47.620
I must get going soon. I have to
make arrangements for the funeral.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.899
I am sorry, Noel.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.899
Have you got the time?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.379
Yes.

23:56.380 --> 23:59.900
I think it's time for one last round.

24:32.940 --> 24:35.659
Are you sure about this?

24:35.660 --> 24:38.219
I think so. Yes.

24:38.220 --> 24:40.699
It's all very sudden, Mattie.

24:40.700 --> 24:44.259
Well, you know that
I love living here, Jean,

24:44.260 --> 24:47.699
but it's a job offer
and it's an amazing opportunity

24:47.700 --> 24:49.939
and I have to take it.

24:49.940 --> 24:52.139
And to do that...
You have to leave Ballarat.

24:52.140 --> 24:56.579
Oh, it's wonderful news, Mattie.
Are you happy?

24:56.580 --> 24:59.300
I'm a little scared.

25:01.460 --> 25:05.419
And I want you to know that
I'm really happy for you and Lucien.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.299
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.020
Why? You deserve this. You both do.

25:35.740 --> 25:39.780
What did Lucien say
when you told him the big news?

25:42.300 --> 25:44.379
You haven't told him.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.900
I don't know.

25:47.420 --> 25:52.260
I don't want to disappoint him.
He'll be fine, Mattie. Trust me.

25:54.780 --> 25:57.459
Ah! Bacon and eggs?

25:57.460 --> 26:00.579
I expect you need a hearty breakfast
after last night.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.459
I wasn't home that late, was I?

26:02.460 --> 26:04.579
It was after midnight when someone
fell over the wheelbarrow

26:04.580 --> 26:06.099
and woke me up.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.259
I'm sure that wasn't me. And then
dropped their keys in the hallway.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.219
That may have been me.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.059
Oh, Jean.
You make it all sound so seedy.

26:13.060 --> 26:16.539
Last night
was a simple ceremonial gathering

26:16.540 --> 26:19.099
of the Ballarat Police Force
and associated parties.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.859
Oh, and Charlie just rang,
by the way.

26:21.860 --> 26:23.619
He's on a train now.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.259
Apparently,
your new Chief Superintendent's

26:25.260 --> 26:28.179
given him the go-ahead
to go back to work.

26:28.180 --> 26:32.659
I see. Well, he should be fine,
as long as he's confined to his desk.

26:32.660 --> 26:35.619
Good luck telling that to Charlie.
Yes.

26:35.620 --> 26:37.499
Eat.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.739
Now, when did you get back
from Melbourne?

26:39.740 --> 26:42.699
Ah, last night. I've been spending
some more time there.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.219
So I've heard.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.379
As long as you don't spend
too much time away.

26:46.380 --> 26:49.099
The place feels very empty
without you.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.659
Ah!

26:50.660 --> 26:52.139
These!

26:52.140 --> 26:54.060
These will be perfect.

26:55.060 --> 26:58.019
Jean's making jam.
She's going to need those.

26:58.020 --> 27:01.660
And she'll get them back,
if I don't break them first.

27:03.980 --> 27:07.219
We need to examine the diatoms
in all these samples,

27:07.220 --> 27:09.859
see if we can find a match
with the water in Reg's lungs.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.140
I can think of nothing better to do
with my day.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.139
I've started with the ones
from his house and office.

27:16.140 --> 27:17.699
They're the most likely.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.579
Reg Foster's
medical records arrived.

27:20.580 --> 27:22.219
They're on my desk.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.139
Right.
And his brother Noel's requested

27:24.140 --> 27:26.099
the body be released for burial.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.859
Fine by me.

27:27.860 --> 27:31.299
You'll have to check with
the new Chief Superintendent.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.100
Dr Harvey.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.500
Speak of the devil.

27:49.180 --> 27:53.539
Miss Foster reported a break-in this
morning - various personal effects

27:53.540 --> 27:56.779
are missing, presumed stolen,
from Reg's bedroom.

27:56.780 --> 27:59.579
I told you she was after our money.
That's all she cared about.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.859
I presume you're talking about
Norma Emerson.

28:01.860 --> 28:04.579
Of course it's her.
Who else would it be?

28:04.580 --> 28:06.779
I want her punished,
and Reg's possessions recovered.

28:06.780 --> 28:09.379
Senior Sergeant Hobart?

28:09.380 --> 28:11.779
Would you mind
escorting Miss Foster downstairs?

28:11.780 --> 28:13.660
I don't need an escort.

28:19.020 --> 28:20.979
What was taken?

28:20.980 --> 28:24.339
Antique fob watch, their deceased
father's diamond cufflinks,

28:24.340 --> 28:25.939
several gold tiepins.

28:25.940 --> 28:28.459
How did they get in?
There's no sign of forced entry.

28:28.460 --> 28:31.299
Valerie says she heard an intruder.

28:31.300 --> 28:34.539
She believes that Norma Emerson
was given a key by Reg

28:34.540 --> 28:37.539
so she could pay him
the occasional late-night visit.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.499
Right. I see.

28:40.500 --> 28:44.379
Well, we know she needs the money,
what with the child on the way,

28:44.380 --> 28:46.739
and she did have it in for Valerie.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.419
Yes. I'll talk to her.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.139
Hobart can check the jewellery
in pawn shops,

28:51.140 --> 28:52.740
see if anything turns up.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.219
Frank?

28:55.220 --> 28:58.259
I'd be happy to go on ahead
to the jewellers', if you like.

28:58.260 --> 29:02.100
My, um... my watch needs repairing.

29:04.180 --> 29:09.059
Yes. I'm afraid I managed to get some
water in the mechanism yesterday,

29:09.060 --> 29:10.739
and of course, it stopped.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.259
I'll take a look.

29:12.260 --> 29:14.179
As long as nothing rusted,
you should be fine.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.979
Ah. Thank you, Sam.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.019
There was something else. Um...

29:19.020 --> 29:24.419
...I'd like to have the size
of this ring adjusted

29:24.420 --> 29:26.419
to match this one.

29:26.420 --> 29:29.540
Oh. This is beautiful workmanship.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.339
Yes. It's very precious to me.

29:32.340 --> 29:34.099
I'll take extra care of it.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.539
Much appreciated.

29:36.540 --> 29:40.779
Sam, tell me, do you purchase
second-hand jewellery, by any chance?

29:40.780 --> 29:42.499
If it's good quality.

29:42.500 --> 29:47.539
Have you bought anything
in the last, say, 24 hours?

29:47.540 --> 29:49.659
I'll check the logbook.

29:49.660 --> 29:51.460
Thank you so much.

29:58.220 --> 30:01.059
Norma Emerson hasn't shown up
to work this morning.

30:01.060 --> 30:04.219
Ah.
And she's not at home either.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.939
You checked the pawn shop?

30:05.940 --> 30:07.979
Nothing. Any luck here?

30:07.980 --> 30:09.820
He's just checking now.

30:21.940 --> 30:23.939
Sam won't be a moment.

30:23.940 --> 30:26.460
Now, let me see...

30:27.980 --> 30:30.220
Oi!
Bloody hell!

30:35.580 --> 30:38.060
Stick with him, Bill!

30:38.980 --> 30:41.460
Stop! Police!

30:42.780 --> 30:46.100
Get off me, you bloody mongrel!

30:55.340 --> 30:57.099
What a surprise.

30:57.100 --> 31:01.819
Ah - fob watch, cufflinks, tiepins.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.459
Reg's, I'd say.

31:03.460 --> 31:06.739
What's your name?
None of your bloody business.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.740
Next time, I'll put you through
the window. What's your name?

31:10.980 --> 31:13.459
Murray Butcher.
He's a local labourer.

31:13.460 --> 31:18.019
We've seen him before for assault,
disturbing the peace and vandalism.

31:18.020 --> 31:20.979
Right. What's his relationship
with Norma Emerson?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.859
We're not sure, sir.

31:22.860 --> 31:26.139
Well, I think I might be able
to shed some light on that.

31:26.140 --> 31:28.779
What do you have there?
Reg Foster's medical history.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.059
Confirms my suspicions.
Chief Superintendent.

31:31.060 --> 31:34.379
I came as soon as I could.
Miss Foster. Yes, thank you.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.797
Just wondering if you wouldn't mind
taking a look at these.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.260
That's Reg's property.

31:44.420 --> 31:48.339
It was her, wasn't it -
the gold-digger secretary?

31:48.340 --> 31:51.059
We have Norma Emerson
and an associate in custody.

31:51.060 --> 31:52.579
They'll be questioned shortly.

31:52.580 --> 31:55.180
A man by the name of Murray Butcher.
You heard of him?

31:56.540 --> 31:59.419
Bill,
would you check on Miss Emerson?

31:59.420 --> 32:01.579
Make sure she's got some tea
and biscuits.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.899
I thought this was a police station,
not a hotel.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.459
Miss Emerson's pregnant.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.979
So she claims.
Have you actually checked?

32:08.980 --> 32:11.099
She's liable to be
making the whole thing up.

32:11.100 --> 32:14.019
If the Doc says she's pregnant,
I'll take his word for it.

32:14.020 --> 32:18.339
She's claiming the baby's Reg's,

32:18.340 --> 32:21.979
but you and I both know that's
not possible, don't we, Valerie?

32:21.980 --> 32:27.099
Testicular atrophy,
a side effect of mumps,

32:27.100 --> 32:29.579
something Reg contracted
when he was a child.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.940
He was infertile.

32:35.740 --> 32:38.780
I won't ask you again,
Murray. Sit down.

32:40.820 --> 32:45.180
I'm not talking
till I know Norma's OK. Alright?

32:50.780 --> 32:52.420
Last chance.

32:58.620 --> 33:01.219
Did you have a grudge
against Mr Foster,

33:01.220 --> 33:03.940
is that why you stole from him?

33:07.220 --> 33:11.660
Miss Emerson, if you don't speak up,
you'll be charged.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.699
I didn't hurt Reg.

33:15.700 --> 33:18.379
Well,
why should we take your word for it?

33:18.380 --> 33:21.260
You've already lied
about your baby's father.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.339
Yes.

33:24.340 --> 33:26.740
Reg Foster couldn't have children.

33:30.620 --> 33:34.900
Murray Butcher is the father
of your baby, isn't he?

33:36.180 --> 33:38.980
Norma's obviously important to you.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.419
I promise you that
she'll be well looked after.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.780
In fact, we've even got a doctor
with her right now.

33:48.740 --> 33:51.659
So, you can do me a favour -

33:51.660 --> 33:55.940
tell me why you were trying to sell
Mr Foster's stolen jewellery.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.660
Norma deserved it.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.339
Compensation.
Right.

34:02.340 --> 34:06.219
For what?
Putting up with a boss like that.

34:06.220 --> 34:09.018
He wouldn't leave her alone, mate.
Kept trying it on.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.619
Hm.

34:10.620 --> 34:15.219
As if she'd be interested
in someone like him.

34:15.219 --> 34:18.300
You wanted
to get your hands on his money.

34:20.820 --> 34:24.139
It wasn't just money, though, was it?

34:24.139 --> 34:28.780
You wanted respect, being on
Reg Foster's arm. Goodness me.

34:29.980 --> 34:33.620
That would have given you the status
you've longed for.

34:35.980 --> 34:40.139
That cow Valerie was right
all along.

34:40.139 --> 34:42.938
He was never serious about me.

34:42.940 --> 34:45.540
I was just a trinket.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.300
He'd never share his life with me.

34:53.179 --> 34:59.820
The pregnancy was your last-ditch
attempt to change that, wasn't it?

35:01.420 --> 35:05.340
I'd have given him
the best years of his life.

35:15.300 --> 35:19.699
Yeah, that's right -
that's her perfume on Reg's pillow.

35:19.700 --> 35:24.059
You see, Norma told Reg
that your baby was his.

35:24.060 --> 35:26.139
Why would she do that?

35:26.140 --> 35:28.180
She wanted more than
you could offer, clearly.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.180
But do you really think
she's worth your loyalty?

35:34.100 --> 35:36.700
Was the break-in her idea or yours?

35:40.220 --> 35:42.779
Did you go in together?

35:42.780 --> 35:46.019
I kept lookout
while she went upstairs.

35:46.020 --> 35:50.059
And you were skipping town today,
was that the plan?

35:50.060 --> 35:54.460
She wanted us to start a new life,
together.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.179
So you had no idea
about her relationship with Reg?

35:59.180 --> 36:02.740
She called him a dirty old man.
We used to laugh about him.

36:04.420 --> 36:07.780
What, why? Is she laughing at me too?

36:11.980 --> 36:14.379
She's a piece of work.
Yes.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.539
Do we have water samples
from their houses?

36:16.540 --> 36:18.539
Yeah. Ned's collecting one
from Butcher's place right now.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.899
Good.
Is she in there?

36:20.900 --> 36:22.900
Norma, Norma!

36:27.140 --> 36:28.940
Easy!
Alright.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.380
Cuffs.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.819
You alright?

36:40.820 --> 36:42.340
Yeah.

36:51.180 --> 36:53.979
If we find a match with the water,
I'll let you know.

36:53.980 --> 36:56.099
Also,
if you're holding Norma overnight,

36:56.100 --> 36:58.539
let's at least
make her comfortable, eh?

36:58.540 --> 37:00.459
Good afternoon.
Ah, Miss Anderson.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.459
Photographs.

37:02.460 --> 37:05.300
Wonderful. Let's have a look, eh?

37:07.620 --> 37:10.499
You certainly have quite the eye.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.419
So can I have a statement?

37:12.420 --> 37:14.979
I've been doing some research
on you, Miss Anderson.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.740
I really do enjoy your horoscopes.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.659
Why so evasive, Superintendent?

37:20.660 --> 37:23.659
Well,
you may be Matthew Lawson's niece,

37:23.660 --> 37:26.099
but you're still
a very junior reporter.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.139
Why are you so interested in
this case?

37:28.140 --> 37:31.980
What are you implying?
Nothing. I'm just curious.

37:32.820 --> 37:36.339
It might turn some heads
at the paper, help me prove myself.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.859
I'll give you a statement,
exclusively.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.539
Really?
Yes.

37:39.540 --> 37:42.820
Once the case is closed, not before.

37:44.140 --> 37:46.700
And thank you for these.

37:51.260 --> 37:55.339
Now, this was the last one?
From Lake Wendouree.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.939
And you're quite sure
none of them are a match?

37:57.940 --> 38:00.059
See for yourself!
I've checked them twice.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.659
Yes?

38:02.660 --> 38:05.899
Dr Blake?
Ned. Come in.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.699
This is from Murray Butcher's place.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.739
Ah, thank you.

38:10.740 --> 38:15.059
Now, this is from the house of a
suspect we currently have in custody.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.820
Let's keep our bloody fingers
crossed, shall we?

38:21.180 --> 38:23.020
Thank you, Alice.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.900
Now, with a bit of luck...

38:38.820 --> 38:40.900
No. They're not a match.

38:47.580 --> 38:49.219
Lucien?
Mm?

38:49.220 --> 38:52.699
My engagement ring...
What about it?

38:52.700 --> 38:57.259
Well, I was clearing out
my jewellery box, and it's vanished.

38:57.260 --> 38:58.979
Oh, the old one.

38:58.980 --> 39:02.139
I've only got one,
and I can't find it.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.739
I'm sure it'll turn up.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.259
Oh. That's a lot of help.

39:06.260 --> 39:10.060
Oh. What's going to happen
to their park development now?

39:11.060 --> 39:13.539
I'm not sure.

39:13.540 --> 39:17.099
Jean, these photographs,
do you notice anything unusual?

39:17.100 --> 39:18.619
No. Do you?

39:18.620 --> 39:22.659
Yes, something. I just can't quite
put my finger on it.

39:22.660 --> 39:25.099
Be a shame
if the park falls through.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.819
Sounded like Reg was doing something
really worthwhile.

39:28.820 --> 39:30.019
The park...

39:30.020 --> 39:32.739
Be nice to have something new
to do on the weekends.

39:32.740 --> 39:36.299
Jean, this photo here...
Yes, this one.

39:36.300 --> 39:40.339
Now, this creek,
this little stream -

39:40.340 --> 39:42.819
does it already exist?

39:42.820 --> 39:45.299
No, not the way they show it here.
Oh.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.579
Well, there was a stream
at the back of the plot. Yes?

39:48.580 --> 39:51.019
I used to pick blackberries there
when I was a girl.

39:51.020 --> 39:54.180
Well, maybe they're planning on
redirecting it.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.940
You are a gem.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.339
Oh, Mattie! I didn't see you there.

40:04.340 --> 40:06.219
Lucien,
I needed to talk to you about...

40:06.220 --> 40:08.779
I am so sorry.
I'm right in the middle of something.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.300
Of course.

40:27.660 --> 40:29.420
What kept you?

40:30.660 --> 40:34.579
I checked the ordnance survey map.
What about you?

40:34.580 --> 40:36.820
I spoke to Jean.

40:38.420 --> 40:41.940
So, will you do the honours
or shall I?

40:51.740 --> 40:54.099
So, what's that thing telling us?

40:54.100 --> 40:55.579
Well, this...

40:55.580 --> 40:57.979
Here - have a look.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.979
This slide is the water sample
we just took from the stream.

41:00.980 --> 41:05.180
Right.
Now, bear with me one second.

41:06.060 --> 41:11.540
This one is the water we found in
Reg's lungs. Have a look at that.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.579
Well, they look the same to me.

41:14.580 --> 41:16.619
Exactly.

41:16.620 --> 41:20.499
Reg Foster was drowned
in that stream.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.379
Which was Council land.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.299
You had motive,
you threatened the victim,

41:27.300 --> 41:30.419
plus you have a professional
connection to the murder site.

41:30.420 --> 41:34.019
Lionel, look at me.

41:34.020 --> 41:36.420
Start telling me what you know, now.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.460
I'll be ruined.

41:42.340 --> 41:45.340
You're a sensitive man.
I can see that.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.139
Whatever's happened
is obviously taking its toll.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.460
Don't you want to get that
off your chest?

41:52.980 --> 41:55.460
Lionel?
Alright, alright.

42:01.180 --> 42:04.699
After I left the Fosters' offices
that night,

42:04.700 --> 42:07.339
I got a phone call from Reg.

42:07.340 --> 42:10.739
He said he had money for me
if I stopped causing trouble.

42:10.740 --> 42:13.659
So he offered you a bribe?

42:13.660 --> 42:16.859
He wanted to pay me
to stop hassling Valerie

42:16.860 --> 42:18.819
and to keep my mouth shut

42:18.820 --> 42:21.179
about pushing the Council approval
through.

42:21.180 --> 42:22.900
What did you say?

42:28.540 --> 42:30.860
I told him to up the offer.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.140
Did he?

42:36.620 --> 42:39.420
He told me to meet him
at the development site.

42:41.980 --> 42:44.740
So you went?
Yeah, just after ten.

42:47.980 --> 42:51.660
Got out of my car, I walked over...

42:54.180 --> 42:56.220
...and I took the money.

43:00.420 --> 43:03.619
I've never taken a bribe before,
I swear.

43:03.620 --> 43:06.939
Please don't tell the Council.
I didn't even spend the money.

43:06.940 --> 43:09.860
I didn't know what to do with it.
I was just angry.

43:11.660 --> 43:13.300
Lionel...

43:14.820 --> 43:18.419
...are you saying Reg Foster
was alive the last time you saw him?

43:18.420 --> 43:22.420
Yes. I got in my car
and I saw them leave.

43:24.540 --> 43:26.579
Them?

43:26.580 --> 43:30.459
You lied to us.
You did see Reg after the party.

43:30.460 --> 43:34.019
What happened with Lionel
was a private business transaction

43:34.020 --> 43:37.099
that had no bearing on
your investigation.

43:37.100 --> 43:40.619
Well, that transaction puts you
with Reg near the site of the murder

43:40.620 --> 43:43.500
and confirms you were probably
the last person to see him alive.

43:45.940 --> 43:47.940
I have nothing else to hide.

43:56.340 --> 43:59.380
Tell us about the councilman,
Lionel.

44:02.660 --> 44:05.659
It suited my purposes
to make him think we were involved.

44:05.660 --> 44:07.819
So it was your idea
to pay off Lionel?

44:07.820 --> 44:09.659
Everything was my idea.

44:09.660 --> 44:12.099
Did I get the credit for it? No.
Mm.

44:12.100 --> 44:14.460
You're talking about
the park development.

44:16.460 --> 44:18.859
Reg had no vision.

44:18.860 --> 44:22.499
He would have been happy
with a rotunda.

44:22.500 --> 44:25.539
I gave it scale and ambition.

44:25.540 --> 44:27.299
There's a theme park in California.

44:27.300 --> 44:30.579
That's where the inspiration
came from, not from Reg.

44:30.580 --> 44:34.139
He stood up at that party,
taking all the glory.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.780
Barely even mentioned me.

44:36.780 --> 44:41.140
It was all about the brothers.
It was always about the brothers.

44:48.820 --> 44:51.179
You struck gold.

44:51.180 --> 44:53.379
Yes, I think I have.

44:53.380 --> 44:58.539
The only reason I exist is because
my father wanted a second son.

44:58.540 --> 45:00.579
I was only ever a disappointment.

45:00.580 --> 45:05.739
If you resented your brothers,
why would you come back and help?

45:05.740 --> 45:08.300
I didn't come back to help.

45:36.980 --> 45:39.939
Charlie, Reg Foster's secretary -
is she still in custody?

45:39.940 --> 45:41.739
Yeah. She's being charged
this morning.

45:41.740 --> 45:43.699
I need her office keys.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.620
What for?
A theory.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.379
Alright, let's hear it, then.

46:13.380 --> 46:19.419
Ah, Frank. The Foster house
and offices - thoroughly searched?

46:19.420 --> 46:21.739
Yes, of course they were. Why?

46:21.740 --> 46:25.259
Look here.
I found that in the stream.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.659
It matches the lettering
on the Goldrush Park model,

46:27.660 --> 46:31.059
except the model's intact.

46:31.060 --> 46:32.579
How is that possible?

46:32.580 --> 46:35.819
In my opinion,
there's a second model.

46:35.820 --> 46:37.380
So where is it?

46:39.460 --> 46:41.939
Reg Foster's car - where is it?

46:41.940 --> 46:45.620
It's out the back. We impounded it
since we found it at the pool.

47:00.060 --> 47:03.939
Miss Foster, tell us -
why is there a second diorama?

47:03.940 --> 47:06.899
That's the development
as I envisaged it.

47:06.900 --> 47:11.899
Open spaces and history lectures?
Families today need escapism.

47:11.900 --> 47:15.620
They want to forget their troubles
and have fun.

47:16.460 --> 47:18.579
What did Reg think about that?

47:18.580 --> 47:22.459
When I showed him how successful
amusement parks were in America,

47:22.460 --> 47:24.900
he agreed,
he was completely on board.

47:26.220 --> 47:31.499
Then why sell this version
to the press and the public?

47:31.500 --> 47:33.539
We knew we'd meet with resistance.

47:33.540 --> 47:38.099
We wanted to start work before
we publicly announced the revisions.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.539
And who knew about this plan?

47:40.540 --> 47:42.619
Just us.

47:42.620 --> 47:44.099
The Foster family?

47:44.100 --> 47:45.700
No - Reg and me.

47:46.540 --> 47:48.940
Well, why wasn't Noel involved?

47:50.260 --> 47:54.339
Reg wanted to tell him,
but I insisted we wait.

47:54.340 --> 47:56.739
Noel's no visionary.

47:56.740 --> 48:02.380
He wanted the park to reflect the
way things used to be 40 years ago.

48:03.780 --> 48:06.700
All he ever wants to do
is live in the past.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.220
The funeral's tomorrow.

48:25.140 --> 48:27.940
Just wanted to be with him.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.180
One last night together,
like the old days.

48:34.020 --> 48:38.220
They mean everything to you,
don't they, those golden days?

48:39.940 --> 48:42.219
There's no harm in sentimentality.

48:42.220 --> 48:44.660
There is when it ends like this.

48:46.740 --> 48:48.620
What time is it, Noel?

48:49.820 --> 48:51.459
I'm not sure.

48:51.460 --> 48:54.539
You asked me that very question
in the pub that night,

48:54.540 --> 48:59.340
which was odd, because you own
a watch identical to Reg's.

49:01.300 --> 49:04.659
For someone so attached to the past,

49:04.660 --> 49:06.980
it seems strange
you're no longer wearing it.

49:08.420 --> 49:11.179
Your watch stopped too, didn't it?

49:11.180 --> 49:14.540
And you were going to bury
both watches with your brother.

49:16.700 --> 49:19.540
I don't know what you mean.

49:27.780 --> 49:30.619
Ah, Noel.

49:30.620 --> 49:34.340
You can bury the evidence,
it won't relieve the guilt.

49:35.620 --> 49:39.179
He told you the truth about the park,
didn't he?

49:39.180 --> 49:42.139
He... he telephoned me.

49:42.140 --> 49:43.660
He said, uh...

49:44.980 --> 49:48.099
He said he wanted to meet me
down by the stream.

49:48.100 --> 49:50.219
He had something to show me.

49:50.220 --> 49:51.979
The second diorama.

49:51.980 --> 49:53.699
He said he felt guilty.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.779
He insisted it was Valerie's idea,
but he wanted it.

49:56.780 --> 49:59.139
He agreed with her.

49:59.140 --> 50:05.179
I tried to talk sense into him but
he just wouldn't change his mind.

50:05.180 --> 50:07.740
And we fought, and I lashed out.

50:09.540 --> 50:14.659
The best years of our lives,
razed to the ground for what?

50:14.660 --> 50:21.419
For this cheap, gaudy funfair,
for more money?

50:21.420 --> 50:23.820
How could that be our legacy?

50:29.980 --> 50:32.820
The tree was the final straw,
wasn't it?

50:44.780 --> 50:50.059
40 years of memories,
and he was going to knock it down

50:50.060 --> 50:52.059
like it was nothing.

50:52.060 --> 50:57.500
Next thing I knew,
I was holding his head under water.

50:59.740 --> 51:03.299
I was angry. I was just so angry,

51:03.300 --> 51:06.980
and I wanted to shake some sense
into him.

51:10.140 --> 51:12.659
Then he stopped moving.

51:12.660 --> 51:15.139
So you took him to the pool.

51:15.140 --> 51:17.180
You changed him.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.899
You put him in the water.

51:20.900 --> 51:23.259
You left some fresh clothes
from his car in the locker,

51:23.260 --> 51:27.180
but you didn't fold them
like Reg would have.

51:29.060 --> 51:33.580
I walked all the way back
to the park to collect the car.

51:34.700 --> 51:38.180
I can barely even remember doing it.

51:39.820 --> 51:44.259
Part of me hoped that
it was just a bad dream,

51:44.260 --> 51:47.180
that he wouldn't be there,
and then...

51:48.660 --> 51:50.300
...I saw him...

51:52.180 --> 51:55.700
...and realised what I'd done
to my own brother.

52:04.460 --> 52:07.980
You'll have to come with us now,
Mr Foster.

52:50.140 --> 52:51.780
Jean!

52:53.660 --> 52:55.580
They're mine, Lucien.

52:58.260 --> 53:02.700
It was never really
the right moment, and now I'm going.

53:06.340 --> 53:07.939
You're leaving Ballarat?

53:07.940 --> 53:10.980
For work, for an amazing job.

53:12.620 --> 53:15.619
Well, that's wonderful news, Mattie!

53:15.620 --> 53:18.339
And of course,
Melbourne's only a train ride away.

53:18.340 --> 53:21.180
Well, actually... it's in London.

53:22.420 --> 53:24.539
I have a placement at St Bart's.

53:24.540 --> 53:26.979
You always spoke so highly of it,

53:26.980 --> 53:29.100
and I've always dreamt
of working there.

53:30.620 --> 53:32.260
Right.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.740
Well, they're very lucky to have you.

53:38.380 --> 53:40.740
I don't want to go.

53:41.740 --> 53:44.900
I never thought
I would leave this place.

53:47.660 --> 53:50.500
We have to follow our hearts,
don't we?

54:00.820 --> 54:04.219
I'm going to miss you, you know.

54:04.220 --> 54:06.500
We're ever so proud of you.

54:07.540 --> 54:10.700
We'll always be proud of you, Mattie.

54:11.940 --> 54:13.540
Come here.

54:15.660 --> 54:17.300
Ah...

54:18.620 --> 54:21.180
Alright, then. Off you go.

54:50.380 --> 54:52.020
Lucien!

54:53.940 --> 54:55.539
Dinner's on the table.

54:55.540 --> 54:58.580
Ah! Lovely. Thank you, Jean.

54:59.420 --> 55:04.939
Do you think she'll be alright?
Yes. Yes, she'll be fine. She's...

55:04.940 --> 55:07.979
She's got a big heart
and even bigger dreams.

55:07.980 --> 55:11.139
I wonder who
she picked that up from.

55:11.140 --> 55:13.339
Oh - I found that ring.

55:13.340 --> 55:16.820
It was on the floor,
near the dresser.

55:18.340 --> 55:20.179
Oh.

55:20.180 --> 55:22.140
That IS a relief.

56:05.460 --> 56:08.220
Check the pubs, the boarding houses,
any vacant blocks...

56:13.020 --> 56:15.020
