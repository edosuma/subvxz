00:01.201 --> 00:02.634
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:02.636 --> 00:04.136
What are you doing?
It's a binding ritual.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.237
Marcel:
<i>I don't feel like myself.</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:07.139
That's because
you're not yourself.

00:07.141 --> 00:10.609
Should I feel mistreated,

00:10.611 --> 00:13.379
My response will be
a hell of a lot worse

00:13.381 --> 00:14.580
Than a grisly piece of meat.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.281
The royal family
will be evacuated.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.416
Francis:
I want john to
have something.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.618
Tell him, every day,

00:19.620 --> 00:21.253
How much his
father loved him.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.588
These may be
my last hours on earth.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.456
I'd like to use them
in service

00:24.458 --> 00:26.191
To my sovereign king.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.027
It's condÃ©'s army.
He doesn't only have his

00:28.029 --> 00:31.096
<i>Elizabeth's gold and support,</i>
<i>he has the armies of hundreds</i>

00:31.098 --> 00:33.399
<i>Of french protestant lords</i>
<i>at his command.</i>

00:33.401 --> 00:35.134
Surrender now
and mary will live.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.668
There can't be two kings.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.437
CondÃ©'s still in love
with you, mary.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.439
And he probably justifies
this whole thing

00:40.441 --> 00:41.774
By clinging to the idea

00:41.776 --> 00:43.208
That he can
somehow save your life.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.677
And come tomorrow,
barring a miracle,

00:45.679 --> 00:47.146
We will
both be dead.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.680
Mary.
Louis, I am pregnant.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.382
I am carrying
your child.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.784
Please, save me.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.792
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

01:02.295 --> 01:04.129
Ugly business,

01:04.131 --> 01:06.231
But I can't begrudge
my men their whores.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.301
Many of them might
be dead by tomorrow.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.770
They're not
the only ones.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.379
You're safe now, mary.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.214
You know,
you made the right decision,

01:22.216 --> 01:23.482
Coming to me.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.717
I will protect you

01:25.719 --> 01:27.519
And our child.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.787
We will...

01:28.789 --> 01:30.355
Survive this...

01:30.357 --> 01:32.224
This coup?
War, you mean.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.525
I know there's little
joy even in that,

01:33.527 --> 01:35.494
As it means francis must die.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.729
Don't count francis out
so quickly, louis.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.231
His men at the castle
are outnumbered

01:39.233 --> 01:40.365
And we have him surrounded.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.635
What is it, mary?

01:44.871 --> 01:46.371
Francis has cannons now.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.240
Cannons?
They arrived
two days ago,

01:48.242 --> 01:50.109
Under the cover of night.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.546
I feel as though
I am betraying

01:54.548 --> 01:55.814
Everyone I know and love
in the castle.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.816
Can we please
just leave here?

01:57.818 --> 02:00.419
I've gone too far to turn back.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.755
No, no, it's francis
who must accept defeat

02:03.757 --> 02:05.824
And the people you love
will be spared.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.727
Captain.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.629
Bring forward our siege guns.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.831
But my lord, they're at
the rear of the column.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.766
It would delay our attack
by hours, perhaps more.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.201
Bring them.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.336
Yes, my lord.

02:21.407 --> 02:22.908
This changes nothing.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.409
When my guns are ready,

02:24.411 --> 02:26.311
If francis does not offer up
his life, I will attack.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.515
And by tomorrow night,
either he or I will be dead.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.356
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

02:39.826 --> 02:42.327
â™ª they all need something

02:42.329 --> 02:47.466
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

02:47.468 --> 02:50.669
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

02:50.671 --> 02:54.540
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

02:54.542 --> 02:57.376
â™ª

03:03.750 --> 03:06.585
Catherine:
Mary has gone to condÃ©.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.220
No, it's not possible.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.555
Of course it's possible!

03:09.557 --> 03:11.557
Your own men saw her riding
towards condÃ©'s camp.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.525
Alone, of her own volition.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.395
Are you really
so surprised?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.463
You told her of condÃ©'s offer

03:18.465 --> 03:19.898
To protect her
if you gave up the crown,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.433
Trusting her loyalty,

03:21.435 --> 03:22.901
And once again,
she has betrayed you.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.403
She might even assume

03:24.405 --> 03:25.804
That you will
take this offer,

03:25.806 --> 03:27.873
Thinking it will avoid
the bloodshed of your people

03:27.875 --> 03:29.408
And save her,

03:29.410 --> 03:31.710
Because she knows
in your heart you are merciful.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.478
Too merciful, you think.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.913
Too merciful to <i>her!</i>

03:34.915 --> 03:36.481
Her selfishness,

03:36.483 --> 03:38.550
Her betrayals--
you have looked past them all.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.486
Even when the stress of it
has nearly killed you.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.488
But this act of hers

03:43.490 --> 03:45.490
Will not just
cost you your life.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.792
We won't be spared,

03:46.794 --> 03:48.260
Your brothers and I,

03:48.262 --> 03:49.461
If condÃ© is king,

03:49.463 --> 03:50.729
Whether you forfeit
the crown

03:50.731 --> 03:51.997
Willingly or not.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.733
If we die, it is at her hands.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.270
And if we live, I will <i>never</i>
<i>forgive her for this!</i>

04:03.843 --> 04:05.844
(knocking on door)

04:05.846 --> 04:07.446
Maidservant:
Madame delphine?

04:07.448 --> 04:08.513
Are you here?

04:08.515 --> 04:10.415
I brought blankets.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.318
Madame delphine?

04:24.731 --> 04:27.266
(creaking)

04:31.771 --> 04:33.038
(screeching, wings fluttering)

04:33.040 --> 04:34.539
(anxious gasp)

04:41.581 --> 04:43.749
(creaking)

04:46.753 --> 04:49.921
(gasps, screams)

04:51.891 --> 04:53.959
What are you doing down here?

04:53.961 --> 04:56.595
Haven't you heard?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.030
That creature I saw
in the passages--

04:58.032 --> 05:00.432
It nearly attacked a maid
in delphine's chambers.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.634
You shouldn't be here.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.503
It's just the
sort of horrid,

05:04.505 --> 05:05.971
Dank hole
a monster would hide in.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.506
Well, if a monster
should come down here,

05:07.508 --> 05:08.974
I have plenty of arrows to shoot
it with.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.042
They're saying the creature

05:10.044 --> 05:11.710
Might even be delphine herself.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.679
Maybe she can transform,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.814
Shift into other beings.
You're telling me

05:15.816 --> 05:17.449
To worry about
some make-believe monster

05:17.451 --> 05:18.984
When thousands
of actual soldiers

05:18.986 --> 05:20.652
Outside the castle--
where I should be--

05:20.654 --> 05:22.654
Are waiting to kill us?
I'm telling you

05:22.656 --> 05:24.723
I know what I saw.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.558
The danger is not only
outside the walls.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.627
It's inside as well.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.831
When did this happen to you?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.466
In the middle of the
night, your grace.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.736
I had a bit of wine and
some fun with them whores.

05:37.738 --> 05:41.540
(groaning) and then I woke up
in my own blood and vomit.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.841
Well, get some rest.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.644
Captain.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.612
My lord.

05:47.614 --> 05:48.814
Tell me my cannons are near.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.515
We need to attack
before this spreads.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.018
Field guns and mortars
are minutes away, majesty.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.820
Let's begin to
form lines for...
Woman: Plague!

05:54.822 --> 05:58.623
It's a plague!
Soldiers gave me the plague!

05:58.625 --> 06:00.559
It's a plague!
Fall in!

06:00.561 --> 06:02.361
Report to your units!
Plague! Plague!

06:02.363 --> 06:04.663
Fall in!
The plague is here!

06:04.665 --> 06:07.032
It's a pl...!
Stop screaming,
you're causing a panic.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.371
Ashes. There is no plague.
It's a hoax.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.973
Man:
Fall in!

06:19.912 --> 06:21.046
Mary...

06:30.923 --> 06:33.558
(gasping)

06:44.404 --> 06:46.872
Your whores.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.641
The imaginary plague.
(grunts)

06:49.643 --> 06:52.978
You planned it all to
scatter my men, didn't you?

06:52.980 --> 06:55.013
Francis doesn't
have cannons, does he?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.016
And our baby...

06:59.685 --> 07:01.653
Was that a lie, as well?

07:01.655 --> 07:02.721
Yes.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.623
(grunts)

07:04.625 --> 07:07.459
No, mary...

07:09.896 --> 07:12.597
Hats off to you, then.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.634
You crushed the rebellion
all by yourself.

07:15.636 --> 07:19.204
Louis, I never
wanted to hurt you.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.506
But I had to stop you.
I had to...

07:24.610 --> 07:26.745
What's going on?
I don't know, but I thought
you should see for yourself.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.747
CondÃ©'s men
are running everywhere.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.781
It's chaos.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.116
Are they forming up for attack?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.584
There's no formation.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.585
They're scattering.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.520
Do you hear the screaming?

07:35.522 --> 07:36.655
(men shouting, screaming)

07:36.657 --> 07:38.723
Francis, I never
told you this--

07:38.725 --> 07:40.992
I didn't think it was relevant--
but right before she left,

07:40.994 --> 07:42.461
Mary gave me
a package for greer.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.962
Said it was very important.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.832
There may be more to mary's
departure than we know.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.734
Now is the time to attack.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.537
Attack? Even if half
his army runs, condÃ© still

07:52.539 --> 07:54.172
Outnumbers us.
Our men will balk.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.208
Which is why
I'm going to lead the charge.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.513
(yelling)

08:05.218 --> 08:08.220
(men shouting, swords clashing)

08:10.857 --> 08:12.257
And don't let them
form up again.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.525
Keep them on the run.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.635
Where is condÃ©?
Find him!

08:38.751 --> 08:40.252
Did you...?

08:40.254 --> 08:42.821
A physician is coming
to bind his wound.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.762
When you left last night,
you had all this in mind.

08:50.764 --> 08:54.633
Didn't you? The plague
and then the whores...

08:54.635 --> 08:56.101
One of you
was going to die.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.837
I couldn't
let it be you.
Why not?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.305
His armies were stronger.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.841
You could have had everything:
CondÃ©, your freedom...

09:02.843 --> 09:04.142
Your crown.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.778
You are my husband and my king.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.314
Mary, we're alone.
There's no need...

09:09.316 --> 09:10.815
He is a traitor.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.251
And I love you, francis.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.055
I always have.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.791
Always.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.297
The king.

09:25.299 --> 09:28.199
Stephan.
What is it?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.135
The coup is over.
We're safe.
(women gasping)

09:30.137 --> 09:32.704
Oh, most merciful god.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.307
I'm sure you all want
to return to your chambers.

09:35.309 --> 09:38.677
Thank you for sharing
your strength with the queen.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.318
You're shaking.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.220
(door thuds shut)
the thought of dying and
leaving my children alone

09:49.222 --> 09:51.856
In this world, unprotected,

09:51.858 --> 09:53.358
Likely to suffer my fate.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.728
Each of them hunted
down, slaughtered--

09:56.730 --> 09:59.698
I couldn't bear it.
Right, you-you...
You're all right.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.833
And so are your children.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.869
Everyone's all right.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.773
Please.
I want to feel your arms.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.842
Of course.

10:14.213 --> 10:15.747
Stephan...

10:15.749 --> 10:17.282
I don't want to lose you.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.284
I know there's
resentment between us.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.753
But it's clear
to me now.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.188
I want us to be together.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.857
To go forward. Together.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.097
(fanfare playing)

10:32.099 --> 10:34.799
Guard:
His majesty king francis!

10:34.801 --> 10:37.102
(courtiers cheering)

10:38.904 --> 10:41.973
Man:
Long live king francis!

10:43.776 --> 10:46.111
Woman:
Long live the king!

10:46.113 --> 10:48.880
It's been a long time
since I've seen you smile.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.782
Well, I've never gotten
so close to losing everything.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.686
And then gotten
almost all of it back.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.054
"almost all"?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.956
I can't help wondering.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.958
When you rode off
to condÃ©'s camp,

10:59.960 --> 11:01.693
How did you get
him to trust you?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.828
I took advantage
of his love for me.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.964
Well, that must have been
difficult for you.

11:08.868 --> 11:09.934
Uh... There's greer.

11:09.936 --> 11:10.869
Excuse me.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.373
I don't know
how to thank you, greer.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.409
If not for you and your
ladies, we would've

11:17.411 --> 11:20.078
Lost countless lives,
and my husband his crown.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.147
It was all your idea.
I simply obeyed.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.882
I just wish my ladies
could be here,

11:23.884 --> 11:25.016
If only to hear their queen

11:25.018 --> 11:26.351
Use such a word to name them.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.886
I will name them my friends

11:27.888 --> 11:29.821
When I come
to thank them in person.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.691
What happened to condÃ©?
Where is he?

11:32.693 --> 11:34.025
Catherine:
In the dungeon

11:34.027 --> 11:35.760
Recovering from his
wounds, thankfully.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.263
And now he can live
long enough to feel

11:38.265 --> 11:39.831
The axe split his liar's head

11:39.833 --> 11:42.867
From his traitor's body.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.937
Would you both excuse us?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.972
Of course.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.177
CondÃ© may indeed one day
lose his head, but...

11:52.179 --> 11:53.411
Not for this.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.446
I've made my decision.

11:54.448 --> 11:55.714
Francis, no...

11:55.716 --> 11:56.881
I-I want vengeance

11:56.883 --> 11:59.918
But condÃ© is worth
more to this country

11:59.920 --> 12:00.885
In one piece.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.787
We can offer him
to his brother

12:02.789 --> 12:04.422
In exchange for a formal
agreement that he will surrender

12:04.424 --> 12:06.791
His family's claim
to this throne forever.

12:06.793 --> 12:09.260
You spare a usurper,
you embolden others!

12:09.262 --> 12:12.897
You make yourself look weak
in appearances and in fact!

12:12.899 --> 12:14.999
Am I stronger by taking condÃ©'s
head and making him a martyr?

12:15.001 --> 12:17.001
His memory would rally
protestants

12:17.003 --> 12:18.937
All over this country
against us, rather than

12:18.939 --> 12:21.005
A few hundred mercenaries
paid for by elizabeth.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.807
His death would enrage

12:22.809 --> 12:24.809
His already vengeful brother,
the king of navarre;

12:24.811 --> 12:26.845
The man with the most
potent claim to my throne.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.813
Francis, how many times
will you pay the price

12:28.815 --> 12:30.281
For ignoring my counsel?

12:30.283 --> 12:33.485
I have already sent for lola
and my son to come home.

12:33.487 --> 12:36.955
I am ending this struggle
with diplomacy, not war.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.924
Now, have you more to say?

12:39.926 --> 12:40.959
You say that
I ignore your counsel.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.894
Well, let's hear it.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.096
I believe
I've made myself clear.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.502
Kenna, I'm so sorry.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.970
If there was anything
I could do to remove

12:51.972 --> 12:54.839
Suspicion from you...
It wouldn't matter.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.174
I'll carry our relationship
with me, no matter what.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.076
You don't have to.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.845
Say whatever you want
about my memory.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.313
I'll be dead.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.948
You need to protect your future.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.284
You and all of your friends.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.952
What do you mean?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.921
Mary bested elizabeth today.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.923
But the english queen's
ruthlessness,

13:11.925 --> 13:13.258
It'll cost many more lives

13:13.260 --> 13:16.094
Than mine and my son's
before she's done.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.429
I heard bold threats
in condÃ©'s camp.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.032
Warnings from elizabeth's
mercenaries.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.867
Warnings? What warnings?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.969
Elizabeth's campaign
against mary.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.237
It's more than politics.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.505
It's personal.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.942
She'll never give up
till mary's finished.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.010
Never.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.511
(screams)

13:33.513 --> 13:35.180
(gagging, choking)

13:40.886 --> 13:41.152
Oh!

13:45.357 --> 13:47.158
So, delphine is
a shape-shifting demon?

13:47.160 --> 13:50.028
Claude, this is fear
and superstition run amok.

13:50.030 --> 13:54.833
Marcel, tell the deputy
what she did to you.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.068
(groans)
it's disturbing.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.903
Delphine seduced me,

13:58.905 --> 14:00.471
During the siege.

14:00.473 --> 14:04.375
Uh, she made me lie
on a bloody shirt, and as we...

14:04.377 --> 14:06.177
(stammers quietly)

14:06.179 --> 14:08.546
...She worked a spell on me.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.983
You claim to have had
carnal relations with delphine

14:11.985 --> 14:13.051
On someone
else's blood.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.186
I didn't feel
like myself,

14:15.188 --> 14:16.921
And-and she said
I wasn't anymore.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.990
Gibberish started coming out
of my mouth, and...

14:18.992 --> 14:20.558
Delphine said
it was pagan.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.626
She bewitched him.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.161
All right, I'll look into it.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.929
In the meantime,
hold your tongues.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.165
The last thing we need
is panic after the siege.

14:30.569 --> 14:33.104
Bash, I need
to talk to you.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.106
Can it wait?
I have to find delphine.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.208
Please, just hear me out.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.878
When I saw you with
delphine, I panicked.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.282
I grabbed at renaude because I
was lonely and felt desperate.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.284
I miss you, bash.

14:46.286 --> 14:50.655
If there is any part of you
that still feels for me,

14:50.657 --> 14:53.124
I'm asking for you
to give us another chance.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.660
Is it because you don't want
to be alone again,

14:55.662 --> 14:57.662
After watching
your lover hang?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.664
I knew before.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.666
During the siege, when
the swords were flying,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.301
I called out to you.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.436
I saved your life,
not renaude's.

15:05.438 --> 15:10.174
I know you're with delphine,
and tell me if I'm wrong, but...

15:10.176 --> 15:12.377
You don't seem happy.

15:14.446 --> 15:18.216
We are still
husband and wife.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.452
We haven't undone anything yet.

15:21.454 --> 15:25.189
â™ª once I hear them
clearly say, who â™ª

15:25.191 --> 15:28.293
â™ª who are you, really?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.228
â™ª and where

15:30.230 --> 15:33.231
â™ª where are you going?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.233
â™ª I've got nothing left
to prove â™ª

15:35.235 --> 15:39.170
â™ª 'cause I've got nothing left
to lose â™ª

15:39.172 --> 15:41.706
â™ª see me bare
my teeth for you, who â™ª

15:41.708 --> 15:44.075
â™ª who are you?

15:46.345 --> 15:48.513
You will sign away
your claim then?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.514
Yes.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.615
(grunts)
I didn't want

15:50.617 --> 15:52.317
To be king.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.219
Not at first.
(exhales)

15:55.221 --> 15:57.455
I tried... (moans)

15:57.457 --> 15:59.490
To leave France...
Louis, please rest.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.225
But when francis had me
captured,

16:01.227 --> 16:03.728
It was elizabeth who saved me.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.730
And she would only
continue to protect me

16:05.732 --> 16:08.599
If I made my claim
on the crown.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.234
I came to want it,

16:10.236 --> 16:12.303
To believe a new...

16:12.305 --> 16:15.306
France under my rule
would be better.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.308
(sighs)

16:17.310 --> 16:19.477
And I wanted you.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.412
You put a knife in me,

16:21.414 --> 16:23.614
And I still want you.
Is that madness?

16:23.616 --> 16:25.383
Louis, I did love you. I did.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.617
But when it
came to francis

16:26.619 --> 16:29.654
And me, you saved him.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.424
Not because he's your king but
because your love for him is...

16:33.426 --> 16:35.426
Deeper.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.395
Stronger.

16:37.397 --> 16:41.232
I wish
you hadn't made me choose.

16:41.234 --> 16:44.502
You'll never know
how sorry I am.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.172
Your majesty, there's news
of your son and lady lola.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.408
No. What happened
to them?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.516
You killed my son.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.018
He had them kidnapped,
lola and john,

17:00.020 --> 17:01.252
To trade for his life
no.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.354
If the coup failed.
What?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.722
No.
But the kidnapping
was botched,

17:04.724 --> 17:08.092
And john...

17:08.094 --> 17:12.497
My son, my infant son,
was killed

17:12.499 --> 17:13.564
During the attempt.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.134
You murdered my son!

17:16.136 --> 17:17.201
That can't be right.
There must be a mistake.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.436
There's no mistake!

17:18.438 --> 17:21.039
I held john's blood
in my hands.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.377
We captured one of his men
and he confessed to everything.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.047
Louis, what have you done?
Nothing! I've done nothing!

17:29.049 --> 17:30.548
I should have killed you
a long time ago.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.616
Francis!

17:31.618 --> 17:33.451
(shouts)

17:33.453 --> 17:35.119
I would never harm lola
or your son!

17:35.121 --> 17:37.522
Speak again and I will cut out
your heart!

17:37.524 --> 17:40.058
(grunting, shuddering)

17:40.060 --> 17:42.226
Even if you didn't order it,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.295
My son is dead because of you.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.330
(grunting)

17:46.332 --> 17:48.066
Oh, god, no...

17:48.068 --> 17:50.368
We will find lola,
and you will lose your head,

17:50.370 --> 17:53.638
Alone in this dungeon,
before the day is done.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.706
(grunting)

17:59.578 --> 18:01.512
I didn't harm your son!

18:07.553 --> 18:08.820
The kidnappers
took lola and john

18:08.822 --> 18:11.089
On their way back
to the castle.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.825
We found one of the men,

18:13.827 --> 18:17.095
Abandoned,
wounded during the fight,

18:17.097 --> 18:19.097
And he gave up the plan

18:19.099 --> 18:23.167
To trade lola and john
for condÃ©.

18:23.169 --> 18:27.171
But the plan
had already fallen apart.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.706
John...

18:28.708 --> 18:32.210
He fell...

18:32.212 --> 18:33.845
During the escape.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.680
His-his... His head...

18:35.682 --> 18:37.215
Francis.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.717
(crying)

18:41.687 --> 18:43.821
(sniffles)

18:45.791 --> 18:49.127
We can't find lola anywhere.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.899
The place where the kidnappers
were supposed to meet,

18:54.901 --> 18:57.268
There's no sign of them.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.538
I sent them away
to protect them.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.841
All I can see is his face,

19:03.843 --> 19:06.144
Everywhere.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.648
His smile.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.785
How-how could they...
(sniffles)

19:14.787 --> 19:16.821
Forgive me,
your majesties...

19:16.823 --> 19:19.323
Your majesty, I told lord
narcisse...
Francis, lola
is still out there.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.858
I know you don't
trust me,

19:20.860 --> 19:22.460
But trust that I care for her.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.761
Let me find her.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.229
Leave us.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.368
What do you need?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.469
Men?
Yes.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.171
But more than that,

19:33.173 --> 19:34.906
I think someone inside
the castle was involved.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.241
The kidnappers knew the route
that lola's carriage had taken.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.543
Do you know who it is?

19:38.545 --> 19:39.877
I have my suspicions.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.213
But to say anything further
might endanger lola.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.882
Give me a day,

19:44.884 --> 19:47.351
But no one outside this room
must know that I've left.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.656
Take whomever you need.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.958
And bring back lola.

20:00.832 --> 20:03.267
The servants are saying
the demon is you

20:03.269 --> 20:04.669
Or your familiar.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.437
They're painting me
as a witch.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.439
I should never
have left my home.

20:08.441 --> 20:12.343
Delphine, I brought you
here and I will protect you.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.780
But do you know why people
would be spreading such stories?

20:15.782 --> 20:17.481
A servant boy claims
you seduced him,

20:17.483 --> 20:19.650
Performed some kind of ritual
on him, with a shirt stained

20:19.652 --> 20:22.653
With blood.
My god.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.657
I told you, people are
superstitious and ignorant,

20:26.659 --> 20:29.994
And they fear me because
I'm a healer and a seer

20:29.996 --> 20:31.429
A woman without a husband.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.631
What else could I be
but a witch?

20:33.633 --> 20:36.634
I know what it's like to be
an outcast and misunderstood.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.502
I will quash these rumors.

20:38.504 --> 20:39.904
In the meantime,
there's something

20:39.906 --> 20:41.606
I need to talk
to you about.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.507
My situation has changed,

20:43.509 --> 20:46.444
And I have decided to reconcile
with my wife.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.980
I can't say I'm surprised.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.881
With a child on the way.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.517
What are you talking about?
There's no child.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.519
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.955
I touched kenna earlier
and got a glimpse.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.725
She's been pregnant for weeks.
I'm sure she knows.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.767
Are you pregnant
with renaude's child?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.369
How could you possibly
have guessed?

21:11.371 --> 21:13.004
I haven't told
a soul.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.805
Delphine has the
gift of sight.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.407
She thought I
already knew,

21:16.409 --> 21:18.042
Being the proud father.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.777
How long have you known?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.979
A few days.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.982
A few weeks.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.817
So that's why you
got me into bed,

21:26.819 --> 21:29.487
So suddenly,
so remorseful.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.489
You wanted me to believe
the child was mine.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.057
Surely I would
take you back.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.959
No, I wanted it
to be yours.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.627
To save you from ruin.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.963
To save you from having
a traitor's child,

21:38.965 --> 21:41.332
A man who was hanged for
trying to kill our king.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.334
Please, bash,
don't abandon me.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.835
I cannot have
this child without you.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.504
If you had come
to me in honesty,

21:46.506 --> 21:47.938
I might have
considered it.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.007
But you lied to me
and tried to trick me.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.009
Because I saw
no other way!

21:52.011 --> 21:54.011
Please claim this child.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.447
You know what it's like
to be born a bastard.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.449
Th-the shame
and the scorn.

21:58.451 --> 22:02.019
Stop using this child
only to save yourself.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.487
We are finished.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.873
Who are you working for?

22:22.875 --> 22:26.077
And we know it is not
the prince of condÃ©.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.645
Do you need
some persuasion?

22:28.613 --> 22:29.814
(shouts)

22:32.451 --> 22:33.951
Stephan!

22:34.920 --> 22:36.787
How did you find us?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.622
Your son, he's alive.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.858
They didn't harm him, thank god.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.026
(baby john fusses)

22:42.028 --> 22:43.527
It's all right,
my love.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.096
It soon will be.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.870
(whispering)

23:01.913 --> 23:03.381
(woman screams)

23:03.383 --> 23:04.615
Help!

23:04.617 --> 23:06.617
Someone's killed
the executioner!

23:06.619 --> 23:08.152
Guard:
It's a bloodbath, your majesty.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.421
Whoever did this,
killed the guards, too.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.161
An imposter.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.729
Lock down the castle.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.097
We must find condÃ©.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.041
The king's guards are
in pursuit of condÃ©.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.544
He fled through the woods to
the north, but we'll find him.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.112
The assassin who killed,

23:35.114 --> 23:39.650
Then took the place
of the executioner, has died.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.486
But we did get this much
from him-- he's english.

23:42.488 --> 23:45.489
Did the assassin infiltrate the
castle, or was he here already?

23:45.491 --> 23:46.857
I don't think
elizabeth has yet managed

23:46.859 --> 23:48.526
To place a spy at court.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.860
It was a daring rescue.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.530
Elizabeth protects condÃ© still.

23:52.532 --> 23:55.065
I wonder if he's
on his way to her.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.569
Or to navarre for his brother's
protection.
Hm.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.137
I've sent men to the border.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.639
With your permission,
I'd like to dispatch

24:01.641 --> 24:03.040
Additional soldiers
to the nearest ports.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.442
Of course.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.076
Lord narcisse.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.878
I need to speak
with the king.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.480
The king is indisposed.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.748
It is a matter

24:10.750 --> 24:12.183
Of the utmost secrecy.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.219
Regarding his son.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.121
Please leave us.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.523
(all murmur acknowledgment)

24:22.494 --> 24:23.627
What is it, narcisse?

24:23.629 --> 24:25.996
I know you want to
speak to francis,

24:25.998 --> 24:29.467
But he is in isolation,
grieving for his poor child.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.636
If you know anything of john's
death, or lola's whereabouts,

24:32.638 --> 24:34.605
Please...
Lady lola is alive, unharmed,

24:34.607 --> 24:38.909
As is her son, the king's son.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.745
Alive? Are you sure?

24:43.615 --> 24:45.149
How?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.618
I believe
the child's death was a ruse

24:47.620 --> 24:49.954
Meant to motivate
condÃ©'s execution.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.856
Catherine.

24:51.858 --> 24:54.525
Yes. Did it not occur to you

24:54.527 --> 24:56.026
That she folded far too easily

24:56.028 --> 24:57.595
In the argument
over condÃ©'s death?

24:57.597 --> 24:59.630
I simply thought
she had grown weary

24:59.632 --> 25:01.031
Of making the same argument.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.533
She was.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.602
More than you realized.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.104
I know catherine--
her gestures, her mind.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.741
Amongst other pursuits, the two
of us spent a great deal of time

25:10.743 --> 25:13.043
Constructing ways
to destroy condÃ©,

25:13.045 --> 25:17.615
So, when she backed down easily,
I... I had her followed.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.017
She dispatched men.
I had my men track

25:20.019 --> 25:21.685
Their journey, which led
directly to the house

25:21.687 --> 25:23.554
Where lola
and the infant were held.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.724
Francis is in an abbey,

25:26.726 --> 25:29.593
Praying to the saints
for the strength to go on,

25:29.595 --> 25:31.896
To face his people, his court.

25:31.898 --> 25:35.199
How could she
do this to him?

25:35.201 --> 25:37.535
In catherine's mind,
his grief would be short,

25:37.537 --> 25:39.036
His child
miraculously returned...

25:39.038 --> 25:42.072
And the usurper,
condÃ©, finally dead.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.807
Yes.

25:43.809 --> 25:48.045
Why turn
on your co-conspirator now?

25:48.047 --> 25:51.582
Catherine is your lover,
your key to power at court.

25:51.584 --> 25:52.950
Because, as it turns out,

25:52.952 --> 25:55.219
There is one thing worse
than being hated

25:55.221 --> 25:56.720
By catherine de medici.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.024
That is being loved by her.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.093
Do with the information
as you will.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.968
(man and woman gasping eerily)

26:12.604 --> 26:14.905
(moaning and gasping continue)

26:16.875 --> 26:20.244
(moaning and gasping continue)

26:22.581 --> 26:24.114
(screaming)

26:29.621 --> 26:31.589
You are a heartless woman.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.190
Abducting your son's child,

26:33.192 --> 26:35.859
Putting him through hell,
believing that he was dead.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.361
I...
Don't bother lying,
catherine.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.862
We have proof.

26:38.864 --> 26:41.732
Narcisse had your men followed.

26:41.734 --> 26:44.668
They were caught.
We have a confession.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.370
Why would you do this?!

26:46.372 --> 26:48.772
Defy your son, your king,

26:48.774 --> 26:51.241
When you knew
that condÃ©'s fate was decided?

26:51.243 --> 26:55.045
Francis's plan was faulty.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.214
Diplomacy takes
weeks, months.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.083
What if condÃ©
and antoine stalled?

26:59.085 --> 27:01.218
Never signing away
their claim to the throne

27:01.220 --> 27:03.687
While another coup is mounted?

27:05.023 --> 27:07.024
You feel no remorse, do you?

27:07.026 --> 27:10.394
The moment condÃ© became
your lover, he needed to die.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.096
Even he understood that.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.732
He understood it
when you plotted against him.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.267
Knowing he was a target is
what drove him to elizabeth!

27:17.269 --> 27:20.938
It was a choice, and he should
have been executed for it.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.674
You do realize
that we could all be dead,

27:23.676 --> 27:26.410
My children slaughtered.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.847
And all because you couldn't
stand being lonely in your role

27:29.849 --> 27:31.749
As queen, as wife.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.684
That's the job, mary.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.019
Get used to it.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.655
I have made mistakes,

27:37.657 --> 27:40.758
But it doesn't change the wrongs
you have done, the grief

27:40.760 --> 27:43.127
You have caused your son,
your <i>son,</i> catherine.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.129
I did it <i>for</i> my son!

27:45.131 --> 27:46.797
And for you!

27:46.799 --> 27:48.232
And for France!

27:48.234 --> 27:50.034
Sweep away the usurper,

27:50.036 --> 27:52.836
Show elizabeth that her agents
will be found and murdered.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.973
I did this for the good of your
realm, here, and in scotland.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.709
I have stood by you, mary.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.711
I have kept your secrets,

28:00.713 --> 28:03.247
I have helped you navigate
through the terrors

28:03.249 --> 28:05.449
Of your position.
When you were raped...

28:05.451 --> 28:07.284
Stop, I warn you.

28:07.286 --> 28:11.755
Francis does not need
to know about this.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.991
It will destroy him.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.893
More secrets?

28:15.895 --> 28:17.828
Is that what we really need?

28:17.830 --> 28:20.097
I don't understand how
you can justify it,

28:20.099 --> 28:23.801
In your heart, in your soul,
these terrible shortcuts.

28:23.803 --> 28:27.004
Ruling requires that your hands
be drenched in blood.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.940
You... Who have led so many

28:29.942 --> 28:32.342
To their destruction, know it.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.011
And francis, who killed

28:34.013 --> 28:35.979
His own father, knows it.

28:35.981 --> 28:39.283
You are no better than me,
either one of you.

28:39.285 --> 28:42.720
And I am sick to death
of you pretending otherwise!

28:42.722 --> 28:45.489
The difference
between us is this.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.157
For us,

28:47.159 --> 28:51.729
Bloodshed is a gruesome
last resort, but for you...

28:51.731 --> 28:55.933
For you, it is as easy as
drawing your next breath.

28:57.502 --> 29:02.339
I have sent someone to inform
francis that his child lives.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.908
And he will know
of your treachery.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.244
And god save you
from his wrath.

29:09.814 --> 29:12.216
Delphine:
Bash.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.818
You have to help me.
I didn't do it.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.120
I tried to save him.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.222
She was pressing
the life out of him,

29:18.224 --> 29:20.124
Keening and wailing
in pleasure.
Leave us!

29:20.126 --> 29:21.925
She's evil!
Now!

29:25.930 --> 29:28.398
How did this boy end up
murdered in your chambers?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.934
I don't know.
I could only feel his pain,

29:30.936 --> 29:33.270
A knife going in
again and again.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.039
You have no idea how bad
this looks, do you?

29:41.146 --> 29:44.882
(panting) bash...
You have to believe me.

29:44.884 --> 29:47.951
I didn't murder anyone,
or draw that pentagram.

29:47.953 --> 29:51.121
You are suspected of
ungodly acts, pagan rites,

29:51.123 --> 29:52.556
And the boy who
says you involved him

29:52.558 --> 29:54.224
Ends up murdered
in your chambers.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.826
What are people
supposed to think?

29:55.828 --> 29:57.961
My god, I'll die for this.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.097
You are the king's brother.
Talk to him, save me.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.866
Devil worship is an
act against god.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.234
It is the
church's purview.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.569
(gasping)

30:05.571 --> 30:07.905
Don't let them drown me.

30:07.907 --> 30:11.809
Please, just don't
let them drown me. Promise.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.177
Don't let
them drown me.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.344
Promise, bash?

30:24.255 --> 30:25.956
Leave us.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.125
She won't run.
Where would she go?

30:28.127 --> 30:30.127
Francis, please, listen to...
Don't speak.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.996
I've always thought,
the one redeeming quality

30:32.998 --> 30:36.166
About you was your love
for your family.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.903
Your son was never harmed.
Lola was never harmed.

30:39.905 --> 30:44.007
You sent armed men with swords
drawn to take them by force.

30:44.009 --> 30:47.110
They could have
been killed easily.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.612
But that means
nothing to you.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.514
Family means nothing to you,

30:50.516 --> 30:52.616
Except a means to an end.

30:52.618 --> 30:55.385
If you had birthed peasants
instead of kings,

30:55.387 --> 30:57.855
And someone offered you
a monarchy,

30:57.857 --> 30:59.389
If only you were free of us,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.058
You'd slit our throats
in an instant.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.893
That is not true.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.228
You are my son, my life...

31:04.230 --> 31:06.597
And now you mean nothing to me.

31:08.032 --> 31:11.101
Not a mother, certainly
not a queen mother,

31:11.103 --> 31:14.972
As I strip you of your title,
your income and your home.

31:16.241 --> 31:18.542
Oh, this is your doing.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.278
No. All mary did was
tell me the truth.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.380
And betray you!

31:23.382 --> 31:26.149
And turn England's
anger against us.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.585
And bleed our country dry
for her own cause.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.121
She will destroy
this family.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.589
I don't need
a prophecy

31:32.591 --> 31:34.658
From nostradamus to know,

31:34.660 --> 31:37.060
She will be the death of you.

31:38.263 --> 31:39.930
Guards.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.499
Return to the decaying
bosom of your true family,

31:42.501 --> 31:44.902
The medicis or flee
to the new lands.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.970
Catherine: Exile?
I don't care, but you
will never be welcome

31:46.972 --> 31:49.940
At this court
ever again.

31:56.681 --> 31:58.916
(courtiers murmuring)

32:04.322 --> 32:05.555
Judas.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.125
I really do love this story

32:42.127 --> 32:43.260
Of me traveling abroad

32:43.262 --> 32:44.628
To set up a royal retreat.

32:44.630 --> 32:48.231
I only wish I really was
decorating a small palace.

32:48.233 --> 32:51.101
I hear it's beautiful
and they throw

32:51.103 --> 32:54.237
The most marvelous
summer's end parties in norway.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.107
Dear kenna, you'll be

32:57.109 --> 32:58.742
Out to here by then.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.677
Perhaps if I stay on
with your friends,

33:00.679 --> 33:03.313
After the baby's adopted
by that couple in sweden.

33:04.582 --> 33:05.983
I'm doing the right thing--

33:05.985 --> 33:07.517
The only thing I can do--

33:07.519 --> 33:09.353
Is giving up the child.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.690
Thank you for finding me

33:13.692 --> 33:16.360
A loving home and family
to hide out with.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.996
And as long as bash
doesn't say anything...

33:18.998 --> 33:20.197
He won't.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.765
Then my reputation is salvaged.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.734
Lady kenna,
your carriage awaits.

33:23.736 --> 33:27.070
Let us walk you down.
No, no.

33:27.072 --> 33:29.639
I want to remember
you all like this--

33:29.641 --> 33:31.241
As the girls
we once were.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.711
I hope you'll remember
me that way, too.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.614
Oh, such dreams we had.

33:37.616 --> 33:41.084
I believe they can
still come true.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.087
Greer.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.555
Mary.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.060
Lola.

33:57.668 --> 33:59.636
I hope you don't mind.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.671
I thought we should talk.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.175
No, I don't mind at all.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.577
You asked me
if I could ever forgive you.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.212
For condÃ©.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.415
For everything
that's happened.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.483
And at the time,
I couldn't

34:13.485 --> 34:15.419
Even conceive of it.
I thought, if anything,

34:15.421 --> 34:17.054
It would take years.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.057
I'll wait.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.525
Even if it takes that long.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.193
Not because we're wed

34:23.195 --> 34:26.396
Or because I have
nowhere else to go.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.098
But because I love you.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.803
Well, you've proven that.

34:32.805 --> 34:35.439
And more. (chuckles)

34:35.441 --> 34:38.508
Your mother would say we are
stained by such choices.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.845
Such brutal and difficult
choices we've made,

34:41.847 --> 34:43.680
But we can only
do our best.

34:43.682 --> 34:47.384
Can we not make
another choice,

34:47.386 --> 34:48.819
One equally hard,

34:48.821 --> 34:52.722
But so important?

34:52.724 --> 34:56.093
To commit our hearts
to each other, no matter what?

34:57.528 --> 34:59.796
If only it were that easy.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.364
It isn't.

35:01.366 --> 35:04.367
It's terrifying
and nearly impossible.

35:04.369 --> 35:07.804
Especially if we think
we can save each other.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.873
We can't.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.210
We can only
love each other.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.248
Francis...

35:36.234 --> 35:38.301
â™ª

36:04.162 --> 36:06.296
â™ª

36:27.451 --> 36:30.687
The last ship I took was made
from over 600 oak trees.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.490
And the one we're waiting on
will be staffed by 311 men.

36:33.492 --> 36:36.359
You certainly
love boats, don't you?
Love them.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.962
Completely.
Ours has 75 cabins,

36:38.964 --> 36:40.931
With mine being the most
ornate, of course, as king.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.465
Seven gun ports,

36:42.467 --> 36:43.667
82 guns, including--

36:43.669 --> 36:45.335
W... I'm-I'm sorry.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.204
Did you say you're a king?

36:47.206 --> 36:48.805
From the kingdom of imereti,

36:48.807 --> 36:50.473
Uh, near russia
and the black sea.

36:50.475 --> 36:52.609
I've been studying abroad,
but I'm making my way

36:52.611 --> 36:54.611
Back home,
because my father just died.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.980
You should attend
the coronation.

36:56.982 --> 37:00.383
Well, I can't, at the moment.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.652
But, uh, perhaps

37:02.654 --> 37:04.721
You and I could
write to one another,

37:04.723 --> 37:06.856
Be pen pals?
And...

37:06.858 --> 37:10.260
Sometime in the next
few months, say...

37:10.262 --> 37:12.762
This winter, maybe I could

37:12.764 --> 37:15.365
Come and visit you.
I could use a pal.

37:15.367 --> 37:18.235
They say it's lonely
being king.
Well, it doesn't have to be.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.502
Not in my experience.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.539
Or at least
not for long, anyway.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.775
So you'll be a man
soon enough, won't you?

37:25.777 --> 37:27.877
I hope so.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.913
Listen, when I come
to visit you,

37:29.915 --> 37:32.616
Would it be all right if brought
my sister's baby with me?

37:32.618 --> 37:34.751
Sure.
Wonderful.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.954
And in the meantime, we have
a whole journey across the sea

37:37.956 --> 37:41.491
To become very good friends.

37:57.308 --> 37:58.908
Delphine...

37:58.910 --> 38:00.577
But they took you away.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.845
How are you here?

38:01.847 --> 38:02.979
That murdered boy--

38:02.981 --> 38:04.314
I never harmed him,

38:04.316 --> 38:06.716
But I did have sex with him.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.485
Cold passion
mixed with your

38:08.487 --> 38:09.686
Warm blood.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.354
It was to bind you to me.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.057
A spell, you mean?

38:14.059 --> 38:16.559
Black magic?

38:16.561 --> 38:17.961
It was to nurture
what was growing

38:17.963 --> 38:19.362
Between us.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.864
The bond we have

38:20.866 --> 38:22.766
And the future
I saw for us.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.501
And it worked.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.404
Without harming
another, it worked.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.039
We are linked.
My spirit is inside you now,

38:29.041 --> 38:31.841
As yours is in mine.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.543
What do you mean?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.945
(echoing):
They're burning me.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.748
Cardinal:
For the charges of murder,

38:38.750 --> 38:40.450
Ritual sacrifice,

38:40.452 --> 38:42.485
Transformation
and devil worship,

38:42.487 --> 38:44.421
I condemn you, witch,

38:44.423 --> 38:45.989
To death by fire.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.926
(screaming)

38:51.329 --> 38:52.495
(screaming)

38:56.701 --> 38:57.767
Aah!

38:58.669 --> 39:00.036
My lord, are you unwell?

39:00.038 --> 39:01.771
I feel like I'm on fire.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.344
(hissing)
get back, witch!

39:07.346 --> 39:08.411
Man:
She's getting away!

39:09.580 --> 39:11.081
Man:
Get her!

39:21.692 --> 39:24.127
I will love you
for the rest of my life.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.396
And I will never
let you go again.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.808
Francis:
<i>I hope she's pregnant soon.</i>

39:38.810 --> 39:40.710
A child is vital,
and it will help

39:40.712 --> 39:42.779
Protect her in France as well.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.849
(groans quietly)

39:45.851 --> 39:49.018
The pain of your illness
never relented?

39:49.020 --> 39:52.555
Your herbs have helped a great
deal, nostradamus, but...

39:54.558 --> 39:56.626
I'm dying.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.398
Yes.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.466
You are.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.938
â™ª

40:21.018 --> 40:23.953
Man: Her majesty
queen elizabeth.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.026
Catherine de medici.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.929
What a pleasure
to meet one so legendary.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.831
Ah, thank you, your majes...
Common lore is that your

40:34.833 --> 40:36.099
Teeth are filed into points

40:36.101 --> 40:38.067
And your eyes
are black with rage.

40:38.069 --> 40:40.870
And yet here you are,
as lovely as a sunny day.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.440
You radiate warmth
and beauty yourself.

40:43.442 --> 40:46.042
Though I know that you are
personally responsible

40:46.044 --> 40:48.678
For the death of nearly
a thousand men in France,

40:48.680 --> 40:50.580
Just this month alone.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.482
My son was nearly one of them.

40:52.484 --> 40:53.783
Oh, you mustn't
listen to gossip.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.453
I was told you'd come
to ask something of us.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.087
Ask? No.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.156
I've come to offer
you something.

41:03.761 --> 41:09.532
The destruction of our mutual
enemy: Mary, queen of scots.
