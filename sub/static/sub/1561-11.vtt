04:06.705 --> 04:08.548
Never the dull moment, eh?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.925
Well, if I was you, I wouldn't
have much to say to me, either.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.968
Wow, self-pity parade.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.974
Is this what you do when
you're left to your own devices?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.772
Well, what's the point in having
a mirror that shows you the past

04:23.972 --> 04:25.394
if you can't wallow in it?

04:25.599 --> 04:28.899
Now, Zed's on bed rest,
and Chas is playing family man

You know, even God rested.

of his dorm.

Stopped breathing.

Well, listen, you-you just,
you take whatever time you need.

Don't worry about your

09:13.678 --> 09:15.021
It's okay, there's no one here.

No one but me.

- Alright.
- Get out of here!

09:27.108 --> 09:28.075
Cool. Alright.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.869
Your towering respect for law

09:30.070 --> 09:32.368
Is just astounding
as always, John.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.576
Oh, I see you managed to steal
from the cop as well.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.003
It's a campus cop, mate,
big difference.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.377

and extremities.

Says here that's consistent with
a sudden loss of circulation.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.424
- Hmm.
- So you know this bloke?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.723
He was friends with Adam,
my teaching assistant.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.800
Alright, we'll need to
talk to Adam.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.476
Okay, so does that would be

09:53.676 --> 09:55.599
talking meaning talking, right?

09:55.804 --> 09:57.477
- Not harassing..
- Oh, yeah. Well, you know me.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.682
I'm well-versed in the art of
pretending to be a gentleman.

09:59.891 --> 10:03.486

that is debatable, here we go.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.990
He was there in the mirror.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.491
Did Adam see him?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.447
No, but he looked like
the man you described

10:14.656 --> 10:16.499
in that house last night.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.337
There was no man, Lily.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.542
And there was no house,
either, it wasn't real.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.628
Wait, wait, last night you said
you saw something, we all did.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.344
We wanted to see something.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.766
It's called group hysteria.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.096
My cognitive psych professor
taught us about it.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.475
When you're just
trying to make sense

10:38.680 --> 10:42.105
out of things that just don't.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.686
I didn't come here
to talk about make-believe.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.397
I came here for Carter.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.778
I need to go clear my head.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.156
(Ritchie) Lily, hi.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.365
You got a sec?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.288
Oh, hi, Professor Simpson.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.831
Hey, have you seen Adam?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.374
I've been trying to
call him all day.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.168
Um, I left him in my dorm room.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.540
His phone's probably off.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.621
So, this, uh, chap Carter

11:03.830 --> 11:05.707
he a mate of yours as well?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.132
Oh, it's okay, Lily.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.960
This is my..

11:09.169 --> 11:12.048
[chuckles] ...colleague, of
sorts, John Constantine.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.427
I'm just trying
to piece together

11:13.631 --> 11:15.929
what happened to your mate
last night.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.977
It's alright.
You can answer his questions.

11:18.178 --> 11:22.354
I'm confident my associate
is not gonna get you in trouble.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.900
We were at the cemetery.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.523
Look, we were just trying
to have some fun.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.696
Any others with you?

11:28.897 --> 11:30.774
My friend Miranda.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.700
And Adam.
I should get back to him.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.869
He felt terrible
about missing office hours.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.071
He's been taking this project
of yours very seriously...

11:37.280 --> 11:39.123
That's fine, you just
tell him we'll pick back up

11:39.324 --> 11:40.541
when he's ready, alright?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.702
You take care
and have a good night.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.163
Thank you.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.675
(John) So. The cemetery, eh?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.628
- Got what you need, John?
- No, I don't.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.962
She's hiding something

11:53.171 --> 11:54.548
and so are you.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.850
But at least I know
where to start.

[dramatic music]

12:14.817 --> 12:17.195
[wings flapping]

12:22.992 --> 12:24.744
Huh. Ha ha.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.047
- Nice landing.
- How's your old friend?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.215
Not very friendly,
to be honest with you.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.962
Maybe that's because
you'd rather wallow in

12:31.167 --> 12:33.590
the dead friends than deal
with them when they're alive.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.843
Uh, you're a bit late
to the party, mate.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.049
Ritchie used to be my ace.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.931
True partner in crime.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.512
All the others were
too easily dazzled, you know?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.064
Used to worship the bloody
ground I walked on.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.141
Modesty.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.852
I thought to myself
here's someone

12:49.060 --> 12:50.357
with a sense of purpose

12:50.561 --> 12:52.780
and twisted enough to face
the darkest forces

12:52.981 --> 12:54.858
that evil has to offer.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.956
Sounds like an interesting basis
for a friendship.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.958
Ah, it's a requirement
with me, mate.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.789
Newcastle left a mark
on our crew.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.672
We all shut down in some way,
but Ritchie's fall..

13:14.252 --> 13:16.129
That was the greatest.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.926
He sounds like he could be
useful to us.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.478
Maybe you can
guide him back into action.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.897
[chuckles]

13:27.598 --> 13:31.023
Oh, I'm not exactly a
guiding light, now, am I?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.524
Oh, bollocks.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.946
[sucks teeth]

13:34.147 --> 13:36.946
Really get on
my nerves sometimes.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.906
Alright.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.493
Folde sela levego

13:48.703 --> 13:51.252
hogy igaz legyen reveal

13:51.456 --> 13:53.709
E-te-titok.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.544
[intense music]

14:07.847 --> 14:10.441
[switches click]

14:20.360 --> 14:22.613
[dramatic music]

14:43.549 --> 14:45.768
[gasps]

14:50.890 --> 14:53.439
[breathing heavily]

14:53.643 --> 14:55.395
- Who's there?
- 'Open the door.'

14:57.230 --> 14:59.403
You have to open the door,
quick, before he comes back.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.701
What? Why? Why can't you do it?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.658
[music continues]

15:04.862 --> 15:06.956
Aah!

15:12.495 --> 15:15.044
(John) 'Beeswax candle,
hieroglyphics and residual ash.'

15:15.248 --> 15:16.340
Now, you put those three
together, Ritchie

15:16.541 --> 15:18.293
and what do you get?

15:18.501 --> 15:21.220
- An Egyptian ritual.
- Hm-hm-hmm.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.890
Well, I'm glad to see it's just
your courage that's wavering.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.717
Now, I found those things
in the cemetery

15:25.925 --> 15:27.552
where your, uh, assistant

15:27.760 --> 15:29.182
'was having
a skinful last night.'

15:29.387 --> 15:30.809
And by the looks of the glyphs,
I'd say it was a ritual

15:31.013 --> 15:32.640
'for out-of-body travel.'

15:32.849 --> 15:36.023
Now, where do you think that
a bunch of college students

15:36.227 --> 15:37.649
would get that balmy idea, eh?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.231
[chuckles]
No. No, no. No, that's..

15:39.439 --> 15:41.783
- Oh, it's gone.
- What's gone, Ritchie?

15:41.983 --> 15:42.905
It was, uh,
it was a private journal.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.531
It was the private journal

15:44.735 --> 15:47.033
of Jacob Shaw.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.706
Jacob Shaw.
I remember that name.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.203
'He was the bloke
who fancied himself'

15:50.408 --> 15:51.785
a traveler to
alternative realms, right?

15:51.993 --> 15:54.166
Right, right, right, the-the
journal records his success

15:54.370 --> 15:56.873
with the Egyptian
dream temple technique

15:57.081 --> 15:59.800
but Shaw stopped writing

16:00.001 --> 16:02.174
after he shot his protege.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.800
Ooh. Well, you know,
in my opinion

16:04.005 --> 16:05.302
the best ones are always
a little bit cracked.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.179
And Shaw, he said
it was a hunting accident.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.600
He was awaiting trial for murder

16:08.801 --> 16:10.474
when he fell into

16:10.678 --> 16:13.306
get this, a catatonic state.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.142
Catatonic. Like, uh, Carter.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.852
Yeah. Like Carter.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.734
And Shaw died
a few weeks later, and..

16:20.938 --> 16:23.441
[chuckles] there was a theory.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.743
What theory?
An "Elvis lives" kind of theory?

16:25.943 --> 16:30.494
[chuckles] They say Shaw's consciousness
traveled to another dimension

16:30.698 --> 16:33.076
and stayed there
to escape his fate.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.501
Well, that does make
for a better story.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.706
One that... sparked
the imagination

16:37.914 --> 16:40.838
of your young teaching student.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.425
Well, if Adam's tried it once,
he'll try it again.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.802
And it's up to us
to beat him to it.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.054
- Us.
- But..

16:49.258 --> 16:51.977
[door opens]

16:54.305 --> 16:57.605
[sighs] Still not picking up.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.105
Miranda was really upset.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.812
I think we should
go look for her.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.613
Hmm.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.689
What?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.906
I just have this... feeling.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.448
What feeling?

17:11.656 --> 17:13.657
What if Miranda's..

17:16.035 --> 17:17.332
Back there?

17:17.537 --> 17:18.753
You mean at that house?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.957
- If her consciousness travel..
- No, Adam.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.839
If it did, if it did...

17:24.042 --> 17:26.465
then we have to go
back there and get her.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.174
You just want to go back there
because it's exciting for you.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.431
No. 'Cause if Miranda's
back there, it is my fault.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.683
I need to find her.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.561
You can try finding her your way

17:37.723 --> 17:40.226
and I'll try mine.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.526
Where you going?

17:41.727 --> 17:43.695
Miranda dances to clear
her head.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.194
- I'll be at the gym.
- 0h..

17:46.399 --> 17:48.493
If those kids actually made it
into another realm

17:48.693 --> 17:50.741
then they've opened gates
that won't be easy to close.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.037
In current conditions

17:52.238 --> 17:53.785
anyone can be pulled in
through that gate

17:53.990 --> 17:55.116
not just the four
that took part in the ritual.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.746
Well, it's worse
than that, John.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.168
Uh, Shaw had a theory.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.871
If-if you're killed
in another dimension

18:00.079 --> 18:02.081
your body here suffers
the same form of death.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.292
Ah. That would explain Carter.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.343
How the bloody hell did Adam
know about Shaw's journal?

18:06.544 --> 18:08.171
Uh, well, we were using..

18:08.379 --> 18:10.302
We've been using Shaw's
research, just..

18:10.506 --> 18:13.009
Ha, ha, ha, yeah. For your new
pet project, I presume.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.514
And what, exactly, would that

18:14.719 --> 18:16.346
Nobel Prize-worthy
effort be, eh?

18:16.554 --> 18:17.771
I don't believe
you would understand.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.440
No? Well, you know,
for idiots, then.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.143
Singularity. Do you
understand it? Didn't think so.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.978
Singularity's the idea that

18:24.186 --> 18:25.984
when humanity
and technology merge

18:26.188 --> 18:28.486
a person's consciousness
can find immortality

18:28.691 --> 18:29.988
inside a computer network.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.819
Oh, it's like a bomb shelter
for your brain.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.575
That would be
the idiot version, yes.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.032
Well, you're practically living
in one now, aren't you, Ritchie?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.867
You've done a great job of
making your world really small.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.875
Hey, listen. You really think
I stopped data-mining by choice?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.252
No, no, no. I got tired of
crashing hard drives, man.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.633
[chuckles] Way too many paranormal
uprisings to keep track of.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.056
The darkness
is almost here, John.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.805
If we don't find Adam
and close that portal now

18:55.009 --> 18:57.387
who knows how many more
are gonna fall through?

18:57.595 --> 18:59.438
And ljust..

18:59.639 --> 19:01.687
Can't have that
on my hands, John.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.403
We'll find him.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.481
We'll find him.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.410
[dramatic music]

19:12.610 --> 19:14.988
(Adam) 'Doo-wat ak-em'

19:15.196 --> 19:17.244
'ka ren el-bee'

19:17.448 --> 19:20.201
ak-em ma-at.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.295
Miranda. I knew you'd be here.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.843
He's after me. We have to hide.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.926
- Miranda, I am so sorry...
- Shh.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.761
[footsteps]

19:40.638 --> 19:42.436
(Lily) 'Miranda?'

19:51.440 --> 19:53.863
[breathing heavily] Aah!

19:54.694 --> 19:55.946
Aah!

20:00.116 --> 20:02.835
[dramatic music]

20:06.747 --> 20:08.249
[sighs]
Looks like Alice has already

20:08.457 --> 20:09.925
slipped through
the looking glass.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.719
(Ritchie) 'Yeah.'

20:23.097 --> 20:25.191
[gasping]

20:25.391 --> 20:27.064
- Jacob Shaw.
- That's right.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.362
- What do you want?
- Exactly this, young lady.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.859
Thank you for asking.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.782
- No, no, please! Stop!
- No!

20:33.983 --> 20:36.236
[Miranda crying]

20:39.864 --> 20:42.242
Defensive wounds.
We need to wake him up now.

20:42.450 --> 20:45.078
Wake up! Ah. No, no, no!

20:46.287 --> 20:48.631
Not now. Ah, I got you. Come on.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.010
[indistinct chatter]

20:59.759 --> 21:02.478
[dramatic music]

21:10.227 --> 21:11.649
It's Miranda.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.864
They found her..

21:14.940 --> 21:17.659
Dead in the dance studio.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.158
They'll be shutting down
the campus, next.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.831
This, right here,
this is, this is all my fault.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.750
Oh, spare me, will you?

21:24.950 --> 21:26.327
You didn't make Adam
do the ritual.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.038
Gary, he unleashed
that hunger demon..

21:29.246 --> 21:30.498
You are not Gary.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.458
And I brought this
into Adam's life.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.385
You see what we are, John?

21:35.586 --> 21:40.092
[chuckles] To other people,
we are what you call cancer.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.597
And we're just
spreading our disease.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.021
[chuckles]
You know, when you're done

21:45.221 --> 21:46.518
sitting on your bloody pity pot

21:46.722 --> 21:48.520
we got work to do, alright?

21:50.434 --> 21:51.902
Pity pot, that's..

21:52.102 --> 21:54.355
That's good, John.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.157
'Yeah, laugh it up,
tell your jokes'

21:57.358 --> 21:59.110
but I'll tell you something.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.033
You don't fool me, man.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.740
Not anymore.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.950
I know your secret.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.128
I know what you pretend
not to feel?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.126
You know why?

22:11.330 --> 22:12.422
'Cause..

22:12.623 --> 22:14.625
I'm feeling it right now.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.472
[dramatic music]

22:21.215 --> 22:22.592
Let's go.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.475
There's still one life left
we might be able to save.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.152
Bollocks.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.856
[gasping]

22:37.064 --> 22:38.987
[knock on door]

22:39.191 --> 22:41.694
[dramatic music]

22:46.156 --> 22:47.999
Professor Simpson, thank God,
please, please come in.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.874
Where's Adam? I need to
tell him about Miranda.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.752
- Did you hear what happened?
- We just came from the gym.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.424
I-I found her body.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.592
There was so much blood.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.171
And I-I can't reach Adam. So..

23:03.007 --> 23:04.805
Lily.

23:05.009 --> 23:05.851
No.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.769
No, n-n-no, please no.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.723
We tried to save him, but he
was trapped in another world.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.935
No, I told him not to
g-go back to that house.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.237
[crying]

23:17.479 --> 23:19.857
Wait. What house?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.446
I never saw him coming.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.201
I just felt the plastic
over my face

23:27.406 --> 23:28.578
and I just..

23:28.782 --> 23:29.999
I just couldn't breathe.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.373
[grunting]

23:36.165 --> 23:39.760
We died, so why are we
still alive here?

23:42.171 --> 23:44.094
Is this hell?

23:45.716 --> 23:47.559
(Adam) If we're still here

23:47.760 --> 23:49.762
it's because Shaw wants us here.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.724
[door opens]

23:52.932 --> 23:54.309
[gasps]

24:00.272 --> 24:03.993
Allow me to apologize for not
giving you a proper welcome.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.572
'It has been a very long time
since I've had any houseguests.'

24:07.780 --> 24:11.159
And I've completely
forgotten my manners.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.710
Forgive me.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.709
Polite.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.666
Respectful.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.797
You young people
remind me of home.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.127
My old home.

24:22.336 --> 24:25.636
So... so restrictive.

24:27.508 --> 24:30.261
It's different in this house.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.471
And I've always
been a sportsman.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.308
So that's what we do here.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.359
We play-

24:37.559 --> 24:40.278
Now, I'm going to
choose a weapon

24:40.479 --> 24:42.447
and you..

24:43.524 --> 24:45.117
Run along.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.364
'You have free reign'

24:46.568 --> 24:48.741
just know that I will find you.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.198
Okay, come on.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.330
Come on, let's go.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.040
[grunts]

24:59.248 --> 25:01.376
(Adam) 'You control this place.'

25:01.583 --> 25:03.460
Which means you built it.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.637
Hmm, you're smarter
than your friends.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.967
Smart enough to know
that this is your reality

25:09.174 --> 25:11.017
and not mine.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.686
And that you can't hurt me here.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.890
[chuckles]
Interesting hypothesis.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.192
Of course, there is
only one true way

25:18.392 --> 25:21.191
for a hypothesis to become
a scientific theory.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.023
Do you know what that is?

25:24.231 --> 25:25.483
'Of course.'

25:25.691 --> 25:26.692
It means you got to
test it, right?

25:26.900 --> 25:29.198
Test the hypothesis.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.163
That's exactly right.

25:36.744 --> 25:37.961
$0..

25:38.162 --> 25:39.630
Shall we?

25:40.664 --> 25:42.962
[grunts]

25:45.127 --> 25:46.424
Where are we?

25:46.628 --> 25:50.383
Oh, think of it
as a spiritual safe house.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.556
This place is amazing, John.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.638
Jasper did alright, didn't he?

25:55.846 --> 25:56.847
Now, based on what you told us

25:57.056 --> 25:58.308
Shaw's drawing your friends back

25:58.515 --> 26:01.610
into his realm through
reflective surfaces.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.187
In Egyptian magic

26:03.395 --> 26:05.773
mirrors are doorways
to other spiritual planes.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.028
But lucky enough, our mate

26:07.232 --> 26:08.779
'He put protections on any'

26:08.984 --> 26:11.407
and all reflective surfaces
in this house.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.447
I don't know what to make
of any of this

26:13.655 --> 26:15.123
but thank you.

26:15.324 --> 26:18.954
Ah, the best thing you can do is
take a seat and have a rest.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.084
What do you two want to drink?

26:25.292 --> 26:27.260
- Whiskey would be great.
- Yes, please.

26:27.461 --> 26:30.385
And my kingdom
to make mine a double.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.808
My mom was supposed to pick me
up from the train station.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.851
I'm just gonna
give her a quick call.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.439
- Uh, n-n-no. Wait.
- No, don't look at the phone!

26:39.640 --> 26:42.109
[dramatic music]

26:50.901 --> 26:52.744
[Lily gasps]

26:54.321 --> 26:56.574
[panting]

27:01.078 --> 27:03.797
[intense music]

27:13.590 --> 27:15.809
[dramatic music]

27:16.009 --> 27:18.011
[panting]

27:19.346 --> 27:21.849
- 'Lily.'
- Oh, my God, Adam!

27:22.057 --> 27:24.276
What are you doing here?
No, you can't stay here.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.069
You-you have to go back,
it's not safe here.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.614
- It's Shaw, isn't it?
- Look, he's a lunatic.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.782
He hunts us, and then he brings
us right back to life.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.906
It is a game
that just never ends.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.454
But you can still
get out of here.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.624
As long as he doesn't
get to you, okay?

27:38.824 --> 27:40.451
' Qkay. Okay.
- Alright?

27:45.747 --> 27:47.624
Her pulse is racing, John.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.176
Which means two things.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.721
That she's alive
and she's scared.

27:52.921 --> 27:53.968
We need to get to her.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.390
No, John. Oh, no. no!

27:55.591 --> 27:56.717
Ritchie, Ritchie, Ritchie.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.142
Listen to me. We're going.
Alright?

27:58.343 --> 28:01.438
We are going.
I can't do it without you.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.016
Can't do it without you,
Ritchie.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.726
Uh, okay.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.857
There's only one way
Shaw could pull Lily

28:08.061 --> 28:10.063
back into another world
without a proper ritual.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.115
It's a creation
of his own design, right?

28:12.316 --> 28:13.158
- He built it.
- Right.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.701
So we need a, we need a plan.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.279
Uh, Lily,
she said they all ended up

28:16.486 --> 28:17.863
in different rooms of a house

28:18.071 --> 28:20.415
a-a-and we can't help her
if we get killed

28:20.616 --> 28:22.084
John, before we can find her.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.252
Alright, so the first order
of business is

28:24.453 --> 28:26.797
we find each other
on the other side.

28:26.997 --> 28:27.919
That way,
we got a better chance.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.295
Right, but what
about our bodies?

28:29.499 --> 28:30.671
John, you don't even
want to know

28:30.876 --> 28:33.004
the dimensional mayhem
it would cause

28:33.212 --> 28:34.805
if anything happened
to our bodies here

28:35.005 --> 28:36.507
'while we're on another plane,
alright?'

28:36.715 --> 28:39.059
'Can we just discuss that
a little bit?'

28:39.259 --> 28:40.385
Just a little.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.056
You know, I think
we'll be all right here.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.766
- Now, come on, let's get to it.
- John, John, John.

28:45.974 --> 28:49.353
You got to understand. We are
flying blind into his domain.

28:49.561 --> 28:50.403
He controls it all.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.277
The only rule there

28:52.481 --> 28:55.451
is Shaw... is God.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.699
And it wouldn't be the first one
I've dealt with.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.281
So, shall we?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.243
Ugh! Huh!

29:08.664 --> 29:11.543
[dramatic music]

29:16.380 --> 29:17.848
Just like back in the day, eh?

29:18.048 --> 29:20.767
Yeah, a little too much like it.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.939
(both) Doo-wat ak-em
ka ren el-bee shoit.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.444
Doo-wat ak-em ma-at.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.619
Doo-wat ak-em
ka ren el-bee shoit.

29:38.819 --> 29:41.368
Doo-wat ak-em ma-at.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.209

30:48.847 --> 30:50.941

- Aah!

30:53.352 --> 30:55.275
[exhales]

31:01.777 --> 31:03.245
That's the real bogeyman.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.788
Come on.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.164
[dramatic music]

31:10.535 --> 31:12.458
We need to find Lily now.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.171
- Oh, God..
- Of course, a dead end.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.677
A fitting choice
for our mad architect.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.679
Uh, John, wait.

31:26.510 --> 31:27.762
I can do this.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.438
I studied the principles
of other planes.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.899
'I can do this, John.'

31:33.100 --> 31:35.398
'I can overwrite his world.'

31:36.395 --> 31:38.113
I know it.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.196
[exhales]

31:47.572 --> 31:49.415
[dramatic music]

31:49.616 --> 31:51.960
(John)
'You're bloody doing it, mate.'

31:57.833 --> 32:00.382
[chuckles]

32:00.585 --> 32:02.053
Nifty.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.972
Very nifty.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.934
[door opens]

32:25.360 --> 32:27.112
John.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.456
[music continues]

32:46.047 --> 32:47.640
(male #3) 'Please.'

32:47.841 --> 32:48.967
Hide me.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.678
He's watching.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.014
Who are you?

32:54.222 --> 32:55.940
(John) Where's Shaw?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.567
[Shaw chuckles]

33:08.528 --> 33:09.871
I'm Jacob Shaw.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.119
And who are you?

33:13.366 --> 33:15.789
[intense music]

33:20.540 --> 33:22.292
[dramatic music]

33:22.501 --> 33:24.799
So the legend's true.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.971
You did come here to escape.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.220
[chuckles] I came here to live.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.768
You're an arrogant,
bloody sod, aren't you?

33:31.968 --> 33:33.641
You're here to
mutilate and murder.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.268
Beings of my own creation.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.100
Those students you butchered

33:38.308 --> 33:40.811
they didn't just leap out
of your imagination.

33:41.019 --> 33:41.861
They were flesh and blood.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.240
Yes, and they invaded my space.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.068
My world, my rules.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.448
It's a lesson
you're about to learn.

33:49.653 --> 33:53.328
Oh, boy, you are a waste, man.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.251
And you're just a psychopath,
hacking up..

33:56.451 --> 33:58.920
[grunts]

33:59.663 --> 34:02.462
Aah! Agh! Agh!

34:02.666 --> 34:04.088
A-agh!

34:04.292 --> 34:05.418
Ugh!

34:07.295 --> 34:09.263
These wounds, Ritchie,
they're his reality, not yours.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.761
'You're the greater mind here.'

34:10.966 --> 34:12.434
'You can beat this guy.'

34:12.634 --> 34:13.476
Ritchie.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.554
In this place, you..

34:16.679 --> 34:18.101
You decide.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.274
'Ritchie, look at me.
Look at me.'

34:20.475 --> 34:22.694
Ritchie, look at me. Look at me.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.275
I believe in you, old son.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.029
Now, bloody do it!

34:29.234 --> 34:31.157
- Unh!
- Do it!

34:33.530 --> 34:34.952
[grunts]

34:37.659 --> 34:40.208
[dramatic music]

34:46.251 --> 34:49.300
Some god you turned out
to be, Shaw.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.178
You forgot the sun.

34:53.382 --> 34:54.679
No..

34:59.639 --> 35:02.108
- No!
- Oh, yes.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.604
(Ritchie)
All this time you spent here

35:05.812 --> 35:08.065
you could've been
building worlds.

35:08.273 --> 35:11.948
'You could've been redefining
life and how we live it.'

35:12.110 --> 35:15.535
'And the day you gave into
your weakness, Shaw..'

35:15.739 --> 35:18.709
that was the day
you became obsolete.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.910
This is my world!

35:22.120 --> 35:23.963
(Ritchie) 'Not anymore.'

35:26.666 --> 35:28.964
[Shaw screams]

35:32.839 --> 35:34.136
We have to get out of here.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.888
This way, mate. come on.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.515
[rattling]

35:39.346 --> 35:40.268
Come on, Ritchie.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.439
(0K3)!-

35:45.435 --> 35:47.654
[dramatic music]

35:52.984 --> 35:55.328
[panting]

35:55.487 --> 35:57.785
[chuckles]

36:02.661 --> 36:04.334
Nice job, Ritchie.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.585
You even got
the temperature right.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.171
Lily.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.214
[rattling]

36:14.506 --> 36:15.632
What's happening?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.012
Shaw's world is collapsing.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.177
We need to get out of here
right now. Let's go!

36:21.388 --> 36:23.311
What are you doing?
We have to go!

36:24.265 --> 36:26.359
This is as far as we go.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.358
No. No! No! No!

36:29.562 --> 36:31.781
No! No! No!

36:31.981 --> 36:34.985
No! they're all still in there!
We have to do something!

36:35.193 --> 36:36.695
There's nothing we can do
for them.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.780
'Come on! it's too late!'

36:40.073 --> 36:42.701
[crashing]

36:49.374 --> 36:52.002
Nothing we could've done, Lily.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.508
They only existed
inside that house.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.215
(John) 'Shaw's gone forever.'

36:56.423 --> 36:58.391
Their souls are free now.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.810
On to the next journey.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.512
Look at me.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.154
[dramatic music]

37:11.354 --> 37:13.823
[gasping]

37:15.650 --> 37:18.119
[crying]

37:22.115 --> 37:24.459
[birds chirping]

37:36.129 --> 37:39.224
- It's your turn.
- Oh... hold on a minute, squire.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.768
And if I go back..

37:41.968 --> 37:43.766
What happens to you?

37:46.931 --> 37:48.933
I stay here.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.729
[chuckles]

37:55.815 --> 37:58.819
Here happens to be
an elaborate figment

37:59.027 --> 38:01.246
of your confused imagination.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.578
What was it
you said to me in there?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.836
I decide what's real.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.168
This is it.

38:11.372 --> 38:14.125
John, this is the reality
that I want.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.252
Simplicity.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.340
And... endless possibility.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.845
This, John, this is,
this is paradise.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.144
Oh, what makes you think
that after a decade

38:24.344 --> 38:26.517
you won't go off
your trolley like Shaw?

38:27.639 --> 38:29.892
Shaw was mad to begin with.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.476
I'll do it right.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.561
I'll build a world here.

38:33.770 --> 38:38.150
I'll invent
and create and thrive.

38:40.819 --> 38:44.699
You know what? I've already lost
one good friend to this fight.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.659
And I'm not losing another, so
I'm calling you on your rubbish

38:47.867 --> 38:49.835
Ritchie Simpson,
if you stay here..

38:51.037 --> 38:53.415
You will go balmy.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.627
Balmier than you already are,
if that's at all possible.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.514
Better here than back home.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.020
At least, in this world..

39:07.220 --> 39:08.722
I can forget about the darkness

39:08.930 --> 39:10.853
closing in on us, John.

39:13.142 --> 39:15.315
Look, I just don't..

39:15.520 --> 39:18.194
I don't want to be afraid
anymore, John.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.159
Fine.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.320
That's fine.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.906
Indulge yourself, Ritchie.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.832
Just like Shaw.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.660
You're two visionary peas
in a bloody pod.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.667
But do me a favor.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.296
Don't lie to yourself.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.003
This isn't about
you creating something new.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.432
This is about you running away.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.895
[dramatic music]

39:51.848 --> 39:53.850
[panting]

39:54.058 --> 39:56.481
[crying]

40:00.815 --> 40:02.283
(John) Ritchie?

40:02.483 --> 40:05.157
Ritchie, Ritchie, Ritchie,
Ritchie.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.113
Come on, come back to me.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.199
Come on, Ritchie,
come on, man, come on.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.035
Come on, come back to me.
Come back, Ritchie!

40:17.081 --> 40:19.960
[dramatic music]

40:37.393 --> 40:38.940
Ugh!

40:39.103 --> 40:41.606
[John laughs]

40:45.610 --> 40:47.612
Oh, you bugger.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.335
[instrumental music]

41:28.236 --> 41:31.866
In our last class, we touched on
the subject of nirvana.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.168
Achieving enlightenment.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.621
In order to do that..

41:37.829 --> 41:40.207
Certain truths must be accepted.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.380
First and foremost..

41:44.502 --> 41:46.880
Suffering is unavoidable.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.014
'Secondly'

41:49.173 --> 41:51.301
you must understand

41:51.509 --> 41:53.807
that suffering is caused
by craving.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.109
Humankind desires relief in ways

41:59.308 --> 42:02.437
that ultimately do not
satisfy the soul.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.486
The third and final truth

42:06.691 --> 42:10.241
is that inner peace is possible.

42:10.445 --> 42:14.120
But humankind's suffering
won't end

42:14.323 --> 42:17.372
until we learn
how to stop our desire.

42:20.955 --> 42:23.549
