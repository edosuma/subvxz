WEBVTT

00:33.783 --> 00:36.119
I guess late at night is
when the cockroaches come out.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.205
So sorry. Was this yours?

00:40.081 --> 00:42.459
I didn't know you was here, sir.
I thought these were just garbage.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.502
You think I eat garbage?

00:44.794 --> 00:46.504
Like some kind of a trash compactor?

00:46.588 --> 00:49.591
Like you?
-No, no, I...

00:49.966 --> 00:51.217
Relax, man,
I'm just having fun.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.345
-I'm Russ.
-Yeah.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.310
Oh, God!

01:01.770 --> 01:04.064
You broke my damn arm!

01:04.564 --> 01:07.400
I'm from Fillmore-Graves,
and we don't play.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.763
Look, Clive.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.890
My dinner has a hat on it.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.935
See, these brain rations aren't so bad.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.062
Nothing tastes as good as skinny...

01:46.523 --> 01:47.524
Feels?

01:51.319 --> 01:54.114
The incinerator is the only place
we know Bruce has been.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.406
Keep your eye on that door.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.329
<i>Dear Diary. </i>
<i>Some mid-year resolutions.</i>

02:01.704 --> 02:03.456
<i>Learn to love dieting.</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:05.291
<i>Stop flirting with the mailman.</i>

02:05.375 --> 02:07.127
<i>And catch Bruce Holtz,</i>

02:07.210 --> 02:09.129
<i>the serial-killing, human smuggler</i>

02:09.212 --> 02:11.840
<i>that Clive and I </i>
<i>have been staking out all week.</i>

02:12.423 --> 02:14.843
<i>Poor Clive keeps sifting</i>
<i>through the evidence,</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:16.761
<i>hoping to find something </i>
<i>more than my vision</i>

02:16.845 --> 02:18.471
<i>that can connect Bruce to the victims.</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:20.557
<i>But those odds seem bleaker</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:23.309
<i>than finding a pair</i>
<i>of size eight Manolo Blahniks</i>

02:23.393 --> 02:25.061
<i>at a Barney's Warehouse sale.</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:27.397
<i>And so, I couldn't help but wonder,</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:31.234
<i>had this hopeless romantic brain</i>
<i>just left me hopeless?</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:35.113
<i>Being hot-boxed by Carne Asada </i>
<i>here isn't helping.</i>

02:36.281 --> 02:40.076
<i>But Bruce isn't the only mystery man</i>
<i>keeping me up at night.</i>

02:41.661 --> 02:44.038
<i>Tim. My lobster.</i>

02:44.664 --> 02:45.874
<i>My Dawson.</i>

02:46.416 --> 02:48.001
<i>My soulmate.</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:49.752
<i>That dreamy smile.</i>

02:50.670 --> 02:53.506
<i> Liv?</i>
<i>-Those sexy, piercing eyes...</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:55.717
<i>Not this again.</i>

02:56.092 --> 02:59.262
<i> Lips so perfect,</i>
<i>I keep asking myself--</i>

03:03.808 --> 03:05.268
You're a secret mean girl.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.395
You don't even know his last name. Look. You wrote, "Mrs. Tim's wife."

03:09.772 --> 03:12.233
Clive, what's even in a last name?

03:12.859 --> 03:14.903
-Accountability.
-Overrated.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.363
All I need, is for Tim to come back

03:17.447 --> 03:20.450
to human-zombie night
so we can rekindle our flame.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.245
-Ugh!

03:25.997 --> 03:26.831
Here, Seattle.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.001
It's too easy.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.128
I'm glad something is.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.256
Since it's been three days,
and no one can find

03:35.340 --> 03:37.091
the camera phone video of Tucker Fritz

03:37.175 --> 03:40.720
getting called up to Team Z
by our very own cadet.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.183
What's the plan to
correct this situation, Lillywhite?

03:45.516 --> 03:48.102
We're gonna start hitting places
where zombies aren't exactly welcome.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.021
-Dead Ender territory.
-Good.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.942
Get it done before this video
bites us in the ass.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.693
We get it, bro.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.156
Do you, Gladwell?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.117
Then you also must get
that the only reason

04:03.201 --> 04:04.285
you're not a popsicle already

04:04.369 --> 04:05.912
is because those breeders
don't know what they have.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.706
They have a video of me
scratching a douchebag.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.210
They have a video
of a Fillmore-Graves soldier

04:12.293 --> 04:14.504
scratching an unarmed human civilian.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.673
That's America's worst nightmare.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.344
Find the video.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.304
Before Tucker and his friends
figure that out.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.821
Tucker.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.573
You can't be here anymore.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.993
-Yeah, but--
-Pop, easy does it.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.663
You can make an exception, can't you?
Just this once?

04:50.331 --> 04:51.165
One beer.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.335
For old times' sake.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.340
Rosie just walked out on me.

05:00.174 --> 05:03.303
Wasn't even a discussion.
Just, "Sayonara, dickweed."

05:06.472 --> 05:08.599
Sackman, where are you going? -I think he's giving Rosie a call.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.605
Hell yeah. I think he's heading
straight to her place.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.442
Thanks.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.527
You're not gonna put
hot sauce in it, are you?

05:19.610 --> 05:20.737
Because I think I'd puke.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.326
Let's get a refill.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.830
So, how's zombie life?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.498
It sucks.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.376
I'm kind of a mess, actually.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.463
You remember the first time
we got hammered?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
Yeah. Yeah.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.424
With those girls in the 10th grade?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.760
-Josie and...
-Mary Ann.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.928
Ooh, I love me some Mary Ann.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.515
So much, that when she took that
cheap-ass tequila out of her backpack,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.642
I tried to down
the whole thing in one rip--

05:51.726 --> 05:53.478
And then you chucked it right back up,

05:53.561 --> 05:57.065
all over that lacy-ass shirt
that she made you dry clean.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.943
That night, when I was a mess,
you made sure I got home safe.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.320
Took care of me.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.282
You've always done
the right thing, Tucker.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.959
Now shouldn't be any different.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.185
<i>Talk to me, all right...</i>

06:34.268 --> 06:35.144
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

06:35.978 --> 06:38.481
<i>I'm not gonna be a zombie.</i>
<i>We made a pact. So do it!</i>

06:39.524 --> 06:40.775
<i>Hey, no. No. Hey. Don't do that.</i>
<i>He doesn't mean it.</i>

06:40.858 --> 06:41.901
<i>Do it!</i>

06:52.787 --> 06:53.871
Come on.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.966
Tanner, Tanner, Tanner.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.010
When are you gonna get it
through your thick skull

07:08.094 --> 07:10.179
to lock the back door?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.181
It's these back-to-back night shifts.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.766
I get all scatterbrained.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.811
Yeah, I'm gonna scatter
your brains across the wall

07:16.894 --> 07:18.771
if I hear any more bitching.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.400
I know plenty of zombies
that would kill for your gig.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.112
I dunno, Blaine.
Maybe we should give one of them a call.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.238
Maybe.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.073
But then, of course,
we'd have to trick them into working full-time without benefits.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.786
And we never pay overtime,
which even I feel bad about.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.747
So, how about we just take
the path of least resistance?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.292
And, Tanner,
you learn how to lock the door.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.418
So, I'm...

07:41.377 --> 07:42.378
Underpaid?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.921
-Tremendously.
-No.

07:46.048 --> 07:49.594
Tan-man, why don't you go
fix yourself a club soda?

07:52.346 --> 07:54.474
Have you lost your damn mind?

07:54.557 --> 07:58.853
I'm sorry, I'm on these loose-lip brains,
hence, the loose lips.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.354
Do you know I sleep completely naked?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.149
-I'm not surprised.
-Yeah.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.985
Look, Chase Graves wants me
to track down this old lady

08:06.068 --> 08:08.404
who runs a coyote organization,
code name "Renegade,"

08:08.488 --> 08:10.990
so I took one of my 16 zombie cures,

08:11.073 --> 08:13.659
turned one of her old customers
back into a human

08:13.743 --> 08:16.037
so I could eat his brains,
so I could get his visions,

08:16.120 --> 08:19.165
so I could find this "Renegade."

08:19.248 --> 08:21.250
-Uh-huh.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.796
Oh, my God!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.299
We're gonna be billionaires!

08:28.382 --> 08:30.426
No, no. I am a potential billionaire.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.137
You are a man who's desperate
to prove his loyalty to me,

08:33.221 --> 08:34.764
so you can reap
the benefits of my success.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.932
That's fair.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.934
So here's your chance.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.020
I need all eyes on deck
for these Renegade visions.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.271
You have nothing to fear

08:42.355 --> 08:45.233
but perhaps spilling your
deepest and darkest secrets.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.362
Why not? I am a team player.

08:49.445 --> 08:53.241
After all, there is no "I" in billionaire.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.702
-There's two.
-There's three.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.037
The third is silent.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.289
-To life,

09:00.665 --> 09:03.459
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.546
You know, I've never been happy.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.131
Not even as a child.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
Oh, this is about to get real.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.974
So, I swear, I'm not making this up.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.644
Larry, Moe and Hurley.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.357
Their names are Larry Nunn, Moreece Dubois and Doug Hurley.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.404
Larry, Moe and Hurley. That's insane.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.073
It'd be insane if the last one was Curly.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.074
Like the Stooges.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.246
So, I cross-referenced these victims
with their missing persons reports

09:40.329 --> 09:41.497
and all of them were...

09:49.630 --> 09:52.800
All of them were from outside of Seattle,
all were from wealthy families

09:52.883 --> 09:57.263
and all contacted one Bruce Holtz
through the same message board.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.389
So, let me show you.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.145
-Ooh!
-"Liv from The Scratching Post.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.647
Tim, my blue crew twinsie.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.567
You stole a kiss, then stole my heart."

10:09.775 --> 10:10.651
Liv, you didn't.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.737
You did not post a Missed Connection...

10:12.987 --> 10:15.740
"I believe in feta"?

10:16.032 --> 10:16.949
Fate!

10:17.033 --> 10:18.284
I was very hungry.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.120
"And I know you felt our soulmate bond.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.165
I'll be at human-zombie night
again this Tuesday.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.333
Meet me there.

10:25.416 --> 10:29.670
I wanna spend the rest of my life
decomposing with you."

10:31.589 --> 10:32.673
What

10:32.757 --> 10:34.258
It's zombie romance.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.594
-No.
-No, no, no, no.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.763
It's desperate.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.723
It's what someone would point to

10:40.806 --> 10:44.268
if you decapitated a stranger
at the back of a bus

10:44.352 --> 10:46.228
and they were looking for warning signs.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.273
Speaking of,
if Bruce found all of his victims

10:49.357 --> 10:50.941
on this message board,

10:51.025 --> 10:52.568
we should try to contact him the same way.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.944
Way ahead of you.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.365
We should make
our potential mark sound rich.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.450
Still way ahead of you.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.497
"Dr. Alistair Manningham-Chabra.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.459
I rowed at Eton,
bowled for the Cambridge cricket team.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.713
I currently reside at a
1200-acre estate in Basingstoke,

11:12.797 --> 11:15.466
though, for my sins, I find myself here

11:15.549 --> 11:18.386
on what I presumed would be
a brief business trip.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.847
Please, you must help me
return to England,

11:21.931 --> 11:25.142
to my beloved wife,
now pregnant with child,

11:25.351 --> 11:26.852
no matter what cost."

11:27.269 --> 11:28.854
I love the new accent.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.564
Very Mark Darcy.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.608
-Hi.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.694
Hi.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.364
You texted me.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.326
Said you grabbed my coffee mug by mistake?

11:42.618 --> 11:43.869
No, I...

11:48.707 --> 11:49.834
Thought it was mine.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.255
I'm sorry about that.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.798
Okay.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.513
Was that your attempt
at orchestrating a meet cute?

12:02.596 --> 12:04.140
It was more of a mug cute.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.266
Or a meet cup.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.017
Do not pile onto this parent trap.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.857
You're really putting
the "no" in Babineaux!

12:22.324 --> 12:25.161
Excuse me. Is the art teacher brain local?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.163
Yes, she died right here
in the Rainier Valley.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.123
Screaming like a banshee.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.125
You don't wanna know. House fire.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.922
Uh, and this brain, the Organic Chemist?

12:37.089 --> 12:39.216
No, glorified intern.

12:39.925 --> 12:40.926
Don't wanna waste your money.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.724
Is that the guy
in charge of Fillmore

12:50.895 --> 12:52.813
Fillmore-Graves. Shh!

12:54.315 --> 12:55.649
Hello, officers.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.401
How are you?

13:01.071 --> 13:03.240
-It is.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.160
No, no, no. He blackmails me.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.167
That fell on the floor.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.251
Enjoy.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.091
If my sister was as hot as yours,
I'd be proud of it.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.220
I just had a vision, talking
to a couple I can barely stomach.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.472
Renegade is operating out of a laundromat.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.432
Nice. Which one?

13:28.724 --> 13:29.767
There's more than one?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.311
I don't know anything
about laundromats, I'm rich.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.855
My mom still does my laundry.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.900
Just one less thing for me
to have to worry about.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.610
And she really enjoys it.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.446
Hey, I forgot to tell you about
the other night at the Post.

13:42.530 --> 13:46.367
One of those Fillmore-Graves guys came in,
beat the hell out of some poor kid.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.369
I've got no problem with that.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.913
Yeah, those big-spending horny soldiers,

13:51.622 --> 13:52.831
they can do whatever they want.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.335
Fillmore-Graves loves humans
more than they love you.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.590
They want you to look like humans.
They don't want you eating humans.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.387
And look what they do to zombies.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.182
-They hate their own kind.
-Right you are, my child.

14:11.183 --> 14:15.563
Because they do not live by
the Good Word of Brother Love.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.023
-Amen.
Amen.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.693
Amen.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.162
Their God
goes by different names. Greed.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.165
-Power.
-Hell, no.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.167
Filthy, filthy lucre.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.211
No.
-Make them pay.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.262
Fillmore-Graves doesn't care about you.

14:50.389 --> 14:54.226
They left you to starve in the streets
while they stay fat in their ivory towers.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.274
We know they do,
and you all suffer for it.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.611
And every devil falls from grace.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.657
The time has come
for Fillmore-Graves to pay for their sins.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.659
And they will pay for them in blood.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.077
-Amen.
Amen.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.079
-I said, "Amen."
-Amen.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.415
-So God can hear you.
-Amen!

15:16.498 --> 15:19.877
-So I can hear you.
-Amen!

15:27.927 --> 15:28.928
Yes!

15:33.682 --> 15:37.519
<i>One cup sugar, two eggs,</i>
<i>two teaspoons of vanilla extract.</i>

15:37.895 --> 15:41.398
<i>If only the recipe for love </i>
<i>was as simple as a butter cream cake.</i>

15:42.942 --> 15:44.151
-Whoa.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.028
I remember this episode of <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

15:46.111 --> 15:48.948
I can't find Tim or the vanilla extract.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.367
What if he doesn't come
to The Scratching Post tomorrow night?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.537
And why did I make
all this food I can't eat?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.122
Oh, God.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.667
Oh!

16:02.086 --> 16:03.629
Remember what we talked about?

16:03.712 --> 16:06.632
Using police resources to find Tim
is an abuse of power? Yes. But also, fate, Liv.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.136
If Tim's a no-show, it's not meant to be,

16:11.220 --> 16:13.430
and you're meant to party
with your awesome friends.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.890
Like, me and Ravi.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.393
I knew it. You two are getting back--

16:17.476 --> 16:20.104
-Not even a little bit.
-Oh, please.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.690
I could cut the sexual tension
between you and Ravi

16:22.773 --> 16:24.900
with my artisanal cherrywood tomato knife.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.986
I know Nancy Meyers
is holding your brain hostage,

16:27.069 --> 16:28.320
so I'm gonna let one that slide.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.989
Speaking of triangles,

16:30.072 --> 16:32.533
how did Clive react
to his lady cheating on him?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.621
You got to tell him, Liv.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.582
You try telling Clive
that his forever person

16:40.666 --> 16:43.335
is looser than a bucket of fishing worms.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.265
I found it.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.851
Oh, brother.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.107
We're losing momentum on this.
I can feel it.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.192
I was hoping Ravi
would have heard something

17:07.276 --> 17:08.777
from our killer coyote by now.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.070
Me, too.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.072
Bruce must get dozens of emails a day

17:12.156 --> 17:14.533
from people wanting to get into
and out of Seattle.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.661
<i>Unfortunately, Ravi's email</i>
<i>got just as much love</i>

17:17.745 --> 17:19.246
<i>as my missed connection.</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:22.124
<i>None. Nada. Ixnay.</i>

17:22.499 --> 17:24.835
<i>What we needed was expert advice.</i>

17:25.335 --> 17:29.131
What those people are looking for
is different than what I'm looking for.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.800
I'm trying to find people with real need.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.386
Those criminal coyotes
that you're talking about?

17:34.470 --> 17:39.183
They're looking for wealth,
desperation, people easy to manipulate.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.477
Can you write that letter?

17:41.894 --> 17:45.689
Can I write a desperate letter,
begging for a man to notice me?

17:46.356 --> 17:47.941
-Shouldn't be a problem.
-Good.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.819
I'm glad to see you haven't given up.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.154
It's not your style.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.822
How do you know so much about me?

17:54.114 --> 17:56.825
Oh, I have been watching you for years.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.369
Almost as long as I've been undead.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.580
You weren't turned by Fillmore

18:01.663 --> 18:03.957
You know, I'm not really sure
how it happened.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.294
I just know I woke up one day
with the hunger.

18:08.462 --> 18:13.300
I got a call from a guy who said
he could keep me fed for a price.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.261
And then I had a vision.

18:17.846 --> 18:23.102
I was looking in a mirror,
and I was this homeless kid

18:23.185 --> 18:24.812
that I used to see out on the pier.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.064
Couldn't be more than 16.

18:28.732 --> 18:32.528
And that's when I realized that
this man that was "keeping me fed"

18:33.445 --> 18:34.947
was murdering people.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.825
Murdering kids.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.537
So, I tried to stop it.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.956
<i>I told the police everything.</i>

18:44.039 --> 18:47.417
<i>Zombies, brains, dead kids,</i>

18:47.501 --> 18:50.420
<i>but they laughed me out of the office.</i>

18:50.879 --> 18:55.676
<i>Three days later,</i>
<i>my husband Max was murdered.</i>

18:55.884 --> 18:57.803
<i>Somehow, they knew what I had done.</i>

18:58.679 --> 19:00.722
<i>That was the first time I saw you.</i>

19:01.265 --> 19:02.099
At the morgue.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.063
When they killed Max, I just...

19:09.106 --> 19:10.232
Shut down.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.568
Just like they wanted.

19:13.819 --> 19:18.824
Later, 10,000 people
were turned into zombies.

19:19.950 --> 19:23.954
And I didn't do anything else to stop it.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.748
Is that why you started doing this?

19:27.708 --> 19:30.586
I started this for the same reason

19:30.669 --> 19:33.172
you started eating
murdered people's brains.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.507
To feel needed.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.594
To feel of use.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.729
-Friendly bunch.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.070
Major.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.615
Isn't that our guy?

20:01.408 --> 20:02.242
Stay cool. Psst.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.916
-Hey, fellas.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.626
Where's the video?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.711
And don't pretend like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.258
You want to cherish the memory?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.678
You. Where's your phone?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.263
I'm prepared to give you $1,000 for it.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.140
It's your unlucky day, I guess.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.018
My phone was recently stolen.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.312
Stolen, huh?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.689
By a shiftless zombie, of course.
-Tucker.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.860
Probably didn't want the world to see him

20:36.944 --> 20:38.820
get his ass kicked
by a little zombie bitch.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.531
I wonder how tough you'd be
without that gun.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.451
Back off.

20:44.868 --> 20:45.827
Be cool.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.538
Listen to your girlfriend, man. Be cool.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.583
I'm gonna need your number
so I can track the phone down.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.168
I'll give you $500 for it.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.837
Yeah, but I know
you got 1,000 bucks on you.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.508
If you were gonna turn me into a zombie,
I'd want you to do it the fun way.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.759
You know what I'm saying?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.057
Way to go, pal.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.518
You just lost your friend $500.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.482
Give me the number
or you'll spend the next week

21:15.565 --> 21:17.567
in a Fillmore-Graves re-education camp.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.945
Or, for your dumb ass, an education camp.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.751
I can't believe he responded.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.628
-We're doing this.
-Well, it's almost time.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.880
-Yeah, we've been through this.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.341
I just need to get into character.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.846
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly on the plain.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.098
The rain in Spain..."

21:48.181 --> 21:50.017
"Hello, Ravi. I'm a good girl, I am."

21:50.309 --> 21:52.019
Liv, I'm trying to channel Prince William

21:52.102 --> 21:54.229
and you sound like a garbage disposal
with a vocal fry.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.023
I thought you were doing <i>My Fair Lady,</i>

21:56.106 --> 21:57.691
the OG makeover movie.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.321
Break a leg.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.826
Hello.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.039
<i>Dr. Manningham-Chabra,</i>
<i>thank you for contacting me.</i>

22:12.539 --> 22:15.500
<i>I'm so sorry you've been separated</i>
<i>from your loved ones.</i>

22:15.834 --> 22:16.835
Oh...

22:17.169 --> 22:21.214
I can't tell you what a relief it was
to hear back from you.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.260
<i>That sculpture, it's wonderful.</i>

22:28.972 --> 22:31.349
<i>Is that a Malayan or a Siberian?</i>

22:34.102 --> 22:36.188
It's Malayan, of course!

22:36.521 --> 22:39.107
You've got a good eye, sir.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.026
Oh, um...

22:41.401 --> 22:44.613
That piece is called "La Tigre d' Oro"

22:45.072 --> 22:48.366
and is a solid gold relic
from the Cinque Terre villages.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.620
It was gifted to me
by Prince Albert, Duke of Kent.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.457
Between us, he lost a bet.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.877
And that's why I never drink
Glenmorangie at the Grand Prix.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.130
<i>All right, then. Let's do this.</i>

23:02.339 --> 23:04.424
<i>I'll give you a time and a place to meet, </i>

23:04.758 --> 23:05.801
<i>you make sure you bring the cash.</i>

23:06.134 --> 23:09.221
<i>Within 72 hours, you'll be back</i>
<i>in Merry Olde England.</i>

23:09.513 --> 23:10.347
Superb.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.022
Ravi is a good liar.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.358
Like Sandra Bullock in
<i>While You Were Sleeping </i>good.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.026
You think so?

23:23.110 --> 23:24.820
I thought he was chewing too much scenery.

23:24.986 --> 23:28.406
You know, I'm so glad
that my soulmate is a zombie.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.408
Trying to date another human
would be a disaster.

23:30.492 --> 23:31.827
It was with Major.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.080
I'm gonna connect with SWAT. I'll...

23:35.163 --> 23:37.499
I think that you should
break up with Bozzio.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.752
Where the hell is this coming from?

23:40.836 --> 23:43.171
It's just... It's never gonna work.

23:48.135 --> 23:51.680
I know you're pretty used to saying
whatever you want without consequence,

23:51.888 --> 23:55.016
so let me draw a very clear
boundary for you right now.

23:56.351 --> 23:59.688
My relationship with Dale
is none of your business. And there's not a brain in the world
you could be on that would change that.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.572
Not that it matters,
because I suspect this is coming from you.

24:10.740 --> 24:11.741
So stop.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.588
According to this phone tracker app.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.174
What is this place?

24:28.717 --> 24:31.845
-That's what it looks like.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.847
Beats a church for humans.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.557
Let's check it out.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.394
Whoa.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.396
Is that the guy you scratched?

24:42.063 --> 24:43.398
Once a zealot...

24:43.899 --> 24:44.900
Hey, Tucker.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.194
Can we have a word?

24:52.991 --> 24:53.867
Hey, Tucker.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.832
We need the phone.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.209
The one you took.

25:02.542 --> 25:03.668
Don't tell me you don't have it.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.342
Okay.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.761
But it's not gonna do you much good.

25:14.095 --> 25:18.350
Brother Love says that the age
of Fillmore-Graves' greed

25:19.684 --> 25:20.518
is at an end.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.938
That's right.
True.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.022
Let's go.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.275
Our God is a vengeful God.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.739
Just keep walking.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.533
Every devil falls from grace.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.412
If you shoot, they'll tear us apart.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.666
I think they're planning
on tearing us apart regardless.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.336
Gorge yourselves while we starve.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.173
Fillmore-Graves steals our brains.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.800
-Repent for your sins.

25:54.469 --> 25:55.804
-Major.
-Hold tight.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.514
We're good.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.891
I don't think you know
what the word "good" means.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.978
All they that take the sword
shall perish with the sword.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.479
Behold.

26:05.105 --> 26:09.276
What devil is this in our midst
disturbing the house of God?

26:10.485 --> 26:11.695
Angus?

26:14.948 --> 26:16.199
And lo...

26:17.993 --> 26:19.995
My eyes have been deceived,

26:20.704 --> 26:25.500
for now we are witness to a miracle,
my children.

26:26.501 --> 26:31.298
Standing before us is the Angel of Chaos.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.925
Celebrate our guest,

26:34.009 --> 26:36.219
for he stormed the gates of hell,

26:36.386 --> 26:38.555
liberating tortured zombies
from their prisons.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.390
A reminder,

26:41.266 --> 26:44.269
that even the best of us
can lose his way...

26:45.562 --> 26:49.357
So, we will pray for you, Brother Major.

26:49.858 --> 26:53.278
That you find your way back
to your people.

26:53.611 --> 26:55.447
The chosen people.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.907
Mmm-hmm.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.492
But if I ever see you here again

26:59.576 --> 27:01.453
wearing that devil's cloth...

27:04.873 --> 27:07.709
I'll knock your skull clean off your body.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.641
You still mad?

27:25.143 --> 27:25.977
Yes.

27:28.563 --> 27:29.606
How about now?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.859
Can we focus on me, please?

27:33.109 --> 27:34.903
Whatever your little thing is
cannot possibly compare

27:34.986 --> 27:36.404
to my having to face a serial killer.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.198
I told you, you're gonna be fine.

27:38.281 --> 27:40.784
I'll be right there
with a full SWAT team, out of sight.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.118
Yeah?

27:42.202 --> 27:44.037
But what if things go wildly wrong?

27:44.412 --> 27:46.164
Shouldn't I have, like,
a code word or something

27:46.247 --> 27:47.457
to indicate distress?

27:48.124 --> 27:50.919
-"Pickles."

27:53.588 --> 27:54.881
It was the first thing that came to mind.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.050
Probably because I just saw
that guy walk by eating a pickle.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.844
Sure. "Pickles."

28:00.428 --> 28:01.388
But relax.

28:01.471 --> 28:04.182
We'll take him down the second
he shows up. I promise.

28:04.265 --> 28:08.061
So, um,  this place
he wants me to meet him, what's it like?

28:08.436 --> 28:11.231
You remember that adorable
French chocolate store

28:11.314 --> 28:13.274

-Yeah.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.734
It's not like that.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.530
Testing. Testing.

28:18.613 --> 28:22.033
He's still not here and this place makes
Freddy Krueger's basement

28:22.117 --> 28:23.910
look like the Wonka factory.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.872
-Stop talking to yourself.
I'm talking to you.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.624
Which is exactly what it looks
like you're doing.

28:29.707 --> 28:30.917
Relax. He'll be here.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.004
Isn't this romantic?

28:35.505 --> 28:38.425
-Romantic.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.176
Just look at Ravi.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.303
He's like Rick in <i>Casablanca,</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:44.389
putting his neck on the line
to save others.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.890
I could just die.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.517
I could just die...

28:47.600 --> 28:49.102
Hello, Doctor.

28:49.519 --> 28:52.188
Of excitement, waiting for you.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.565
And here you are.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.817
-Here I am.
-Get ready.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.195
So, you probably want your money.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.283
-There's no rush.
-Oh, pickle.

29:03.366 --> 29:06.369
-I'll get it off your corpse.
-I'm in quite a pickle.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.919
It's a G17.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.421
Use it for work.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.672
I'm a security guard.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.591
G17 is a weapon match for the gun

29:19.674 --> 29:21.885
that killed Annie Wallace. Let's go.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.971
So? That ain't enough to hold me.

29:25.513 --> 29:26.973
How about this?

29:28.224 --> 29:29.601
Is this enough?

29:29.809 --> 29:32.270
A direct connection between
you and the incinerator

29:32.353 --> 29:33.855
where you burned your victims.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.991
Nice work, Pickles.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.869
Let's agree that calling me that
isn't going to become a thing, okay?

29:47.952 --> 29:50.079
-And thank you.
-See you later.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.711
Ravi, do you have the keys to the van?

29:56.795 --> 29:57.879
You had them.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.798
I thought I gave them back to you.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.967
I don't have them.
Could they have fallen out of your pocket?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.219
Maybe.

30:04.552 --> 30:08.264
We gotta go look for these,
so we'll get the next one.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.614
Elevator's stuck.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.035
I'm not getting any service down here.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.120
You?

30:32.497 --> 30:33.456
Liv...

30:33.957 --> 30:35.667
<i>A soulmate is forever,</i>

30:36.000 --> 30:38.002
<i>and forever is a long time,</i>

30:38.169 --> 30:39.963
<i>especially when you're undead.</i>

30:40.213 --> 30:42.507
<i>And, so I couldn't help but wonder...</i> <i>Is all of New Seattle settling?</i>

30:45.468 --> 30:46.845
<i>Or just Clive?</i>

30:46.970 --> 30:48.096
Liv...

30:50.974 --> 30:52.058
Clive.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.768
I have something to confess.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.272
Good. Because that
"elevator meet cute" was too much.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.815
What elevator meet cute?

30:59.107 --> 31:00.275
What? I'm serious.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.443
You didn't stop the elevator
for me and Michelle

31:02.527 --> 31:04.362
-No.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.032
But that means fate willed you
to have an actual meet cute,

31:08.116 --> 31:09.742
which is actually adorable.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.744
Then what do you have to confess?

31:13.037 --> 31:14.914
All that weird Bozzio stuff...

31:15.665 --> 31:17.208
The reason that I said what I did...

31:18.918 --> 31:21.880
I saw Bozzio kissing another guy
at The Scratching Post.

31:30.096 --> 31:33.266
I'm so sorry, Clive, for everything.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.059
I thought you would want to know.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.145
We're in an open relationship.

31:37.937 --> 31:38.855
Oh.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.356
Yeah.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.651
You don't seem like
the open relationship type.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.236
I'm not.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.657
But I'm in love and I'm willing
to try anything to make it work.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.871
Hearing about the other guys though...

31:56.956 --> 31:57.957
Man.

32:00.209 --> 32:04.047
Maybe Michelle can help you
work through it...

32:05.423 --> 32:07.800
-Too soon.
-Okay.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.680
I can't believe you guys talked me
into bringing you here.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.141
Here are the rules. Two drink maximum.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.101
-No hookers.
-Aw.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.396
-But I want a hooker.
-Definitely no blue brains.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.816
And most definitely, an order
of nachos for Major.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.193
I'm hitting the head.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.070
Is that where they keep the hookers?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.991
Talk to me about your blue brains.
-They're all good.

32:34.410 --> 32:37.163
Do we not check IDs anymore?

32:38.081 --> 32:40.208
Let's see.
We've got a Jewish-American princess.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.544
A drag racer. A drag queen.
A pro wrestler.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.594
Sir?

32:51.886 --> 32:53.012
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.515
This is my first time here.
I'm not sure how it works...

32:55.723 --> 32:58.643
Well, might I suggest
one of our "Brains of the Night"?

32:58.726 --> 33:01.771
We still have a few slices
of Architect brain available.

33:01.854 --> 33:04.148
And our Young Love brain
has been very popular.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.985
"This mid-Western belle
with a heart of gold

33:07.068 --> 33:09.654
will transport you
to a more innocent time."

33:10.780 --> 33:12.323
That sounds perfect
after the week I've had.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.241
Thank you.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.624
There. Now say goodbye to Parkinson's.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.920
Detergent Care Laundry.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.631
-I've had a... I'm sorry.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.634
I just had a vision of a laundromat.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.262
And I think my life is about
to change for the better.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.097
Oh. Good for you.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.183
Tell me, where do you
get all these brains?

33:39.267 --> 33:42.437
Well, I'm the head
of a huge criminal enterprise.

33:47.316 --> 33:50.194
Now, I have to go do a terrible
thing to a nice old lady.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.529
Enjoy your meal.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.281
That's great.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.415
Greg.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.752
Boy, if you keep eating like that,
it's gonna kill you.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.128
I have a good metabolism.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.548
Hide, Mama.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.273
Renegade, I presume?

34:36.449 --> 34:37.658
Ho, ho, ho!

34:38.076 --> 34:39.494
Merry Christmas!

34:43.956 --> 34:46.793
Why don't you show this youngster
what he gets for being so good this year?

34:48.961 --> 34:50.963
Renegade, meet Chase Graves.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.633
He's been looking for you.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.471
Good work.

34:59.889 --> 35:00.890
Great work.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.976
We'll always have Paris.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.580
Sweater Ravi versus Make-over Ravi.

35:24.664 --> 35:25.957
Who will win

35:26.040 --> 35:27.667
Or are we living in a computer simulation?

35:27.750 --> 35:31.087
Ugh, I forgot that Sweater Ravi
came with Simulation theory.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.421
Where's Tim?

35:32.505 --> 35:34.841
-You gave me wrestler brain!

35:35.091 --> 35:37.844
Well, that makes me so angry!

35:37.969 --> 35:39.303
Oh!

35:41.389 --> 35:44.725
-Um...
-I got dosed with wrestler brain!

35:44.809 --> 35:47.895
We heard you.
All of New Seattle heard you.

35:48.604 --> 35:49.647
Hey, Liv.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.066
How is it going with the new boyfriend?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.776
I'm sorry, Major.

35:53.943 --> 35:55.945
But it's only right that you should know.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.197
I have a new-new boyfriend.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.367
And if there's such a thing as love,
he's in there.

36:01.701 --> 36:02.910
And I must go to him.

36:04.537 --> 36:05.913
That's cool.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.957
You sound like a maniac.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.045
<i>Here it is, the moment of truth.</i>

37:03.221 --> 37:04.263
-Ugh.
-Oh.

37:04.639 --> 37:05.890
Hell, not again.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.517
That is not an easy thing to see!

37:09.018 --> 37:11.854
But I am glad she's happy!

37:11.938 --> 37:16.776
It makes me happy!

37:17.693 --> 37:18.903
That's very mature.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.450
-Thanks.
-You got it.

37:26.661 --> 37:31.249
Liv, I know this
is a weird thing to scream in your face,

37:31.499 --> 37:34.543
but I hate the way
we left things after our fight.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.923
And I want you to know
that no matter our politics,

37:39.006 --> 37:40.967
I care about you.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.804
And want us always to be friends.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.598
Thank you, Major!

37:48.933 --> 37:50.059
You're the best.

37:50.434 --> 37:54.563
So, tell me about this new

37:54.647 --> 37:56.190
What's he like?

37:56.524 --> 37:58.109
His name is Tim.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.278
He likes The Scratching Post.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.489
He's tall. Uh... Tall-ish.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.117
Or maybe he's more medium height...

38:07.994 --> 38:10.204
I actually don't know that much about him.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.747
I should probably fix that.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.624
You do you, girl!

38:17.128 --> 38:18.504
Sorry. Sorry.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.256
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.757
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.141
Why don't we just chat a little first?

38:30.558 --> 38:32.351
-Okay.

38:32.768 --> 38:36.188
-Life changing. Mind blowing.
-Oh, do tell.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.357
Sunday, my friend took me
to this cool new church.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.693
The preacher, he's so intense
but brilliant.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.570
He really understands the role
that humans should play

38:42.653 --> 38:44.613
-in the new world order.

38:44.780 --> 38:47.950
Food. Humans are
our evolutionary inferiors.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.744
<i>And just like that,</i>

38:49.952 --> 38:52.621
<i>my Prince Charming turned into a horrible,</i> <i>wart-covered, zombie-supremacist frog.</i>

39:06.093 --> 39:08.554
-To be with my friends.

39:09.055 --> 39:12.308
My human friends who are more
evolved than you will ever be.

39:12.975 --> 39:14.393
Goodbye, Tim.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.979
I guess I didn't need to know
your last name after all.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.066
-It's Timmerson.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.817
No, thank you.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.786
Did you find out what he's like?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.580
Yeah. He was a creep.

39:37.500 --> 39:42.588
Time for the human-zombie dance-off!

39:45.383 --> 39:48.135
Zombies, you get the side
closest to the exit.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.805
Humans to the side closest to the kitchen.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.515
It's go time!

39:53.641 --> 39:56.227
<i>Maybe looking </i>
<i>for soulmates is overrated.</i>

39:56.644 --> 39:59.397
<i>Or maybe we're looking</i>
<i>in the wrong places.</i>

40:26.006 --> 40:27.633
Sweater Ravi!

40:31.053 --> 40:33.764
I heard about your adventures
with the Dutch Oven Killer.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.182
Very brave.

40:36.559 --> 40:40.146
<i>Maybe our soulmates</i>
<i>are the people who are already there,</i>

40:40.604 --> 40:43.899
<i>standing by our sides,</i>
<i>while romances come and go.</i>

41:02.835 --> 41:04.712
<i>And if these are my soulmates,</i>

41:05.129 --> 41:08.591
<i>I just might be the luckiest girl</i>
<i>in the world.</i>
