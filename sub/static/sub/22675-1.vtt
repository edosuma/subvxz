♪ Oh, honey ♪

01:46.080 --> 01:48.348
A confession.

01:48.350 --> 01:50.283
Is that what they call it?

02:05.533 --> 02:10.870
Billy Lyons was thrown in jail
for three days

02:10.872 --> 02:12.272
without cause.

02:16.043 --> 02:20.080
In the case of Inez Washington
v. the CR&L Bus Company,

02:20.082 --> 02:23.950
gentlemen, I have reviewed
all the papers and briefs in my chambers

02:23.952 --> 02:26.086
and I am prepared to rule.

02:26.088 --> 02:28.386
The court finds that
service of the complaint

02:28.398 --> 02:30.356
was in fact made at
the wrong address,

02:30.358 --> 02:32.592
as Attorney Friedman has argued.

02:32.594 --> 02:35.595
Therefore, the defendant's
motion to dismiss

02:35.597 --> 02:36.963
is granted.

02:36.965 --> 02:39.399
Thank you, Your Honor.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.367
Great work, Friedman.

02:44.406 --> 02:45.772
And to get their confession,

02:45.774 --> 02:47.373
Special Agent Cheatwood,

02:47.375 --> 02:49.742
sent by the governor himself,

02:49.744 --> 02:51.244
took this club...

02:51.246 --> 02:54.481
his "nigger beater,"
he called it.

02:54.483 --> 02:56.349
He tied Billy Lyons
to a chair...

02:58.285 --> 03:01.221
and he pounded Billy Lyons
in the head with it.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.723
And still Billy Lyons insisted

03:03.725 --> 03:05.725
he had not committed
these murders.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.628
We had this one
pegged as a loser.

03:08.630 --> 03:10.930
You've got a real knack
for spotting technicalities.

03:10.932 --> 03:12.499
Thank you,
Mr. Sprague.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.905
I'll be sending some more files your way,
if you've got the time.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.341
I will make the time.
Good.

03:24.178 --> 03:26.246
They forced him into their car

03:26.248 --> 03:28.548
and hauled him off
to the murder scene.

03:30.818 --> 03:34.187
The bodies had been burned
and were decomposing.

03:34.189 --> 03:36.789
They took some of the bones
of these dead bodies,

03:36.791 --> 03:40.460
put them in a pan and placed them
in Billy Lyons' hands.

03:40.462 --> 03:42.295
They admitted this.

03:42.297 --> 03:44.964
Delirious
with exhaustion and pain,

03:44.966 --> 03:48.868
Billy Lyons confessed to a crime
he did not commit.

03:48.870 --> 03:51.604
And it is based upon
that confession alone

03:51.606 --> 03:55.441
that they now seek to hang
Billy Lyons by the neck...

03:56.510 --> 03:57.944
until he is dead.

04:00.648 --> 04:04.384
You'll get them the next time, baby.
There may not be a next time.

04:04.386 --> 04:06.886
We needed this one.
All right.

04:06.888 --> 04:09.789
When you coming home?
I'll be on the next train to Knoxville.

04:09.791 --> 04:13.293
I should be home
by midday Wednesday.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.629
Okay. Be safe. I love you.
I love you too.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.430
Bye, baby.
See you soon.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.608
Hey, boy.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.118
Boy, what do you think
you're doing here?

04:44.259 --> 04:46.726
What you gonna do, nigger?

04:46.728 --> 04:49.596
All aboard.

04:49.598 --> 04:51.798
I'll see you boys another time.

04:53.267 --> 04:56.135
That son of a bitch.
Let's go scare him.

05:00.441 --> 05:01.908
Shoot him.

05:21.629 --> 05:24.030
NAACP.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.299
Please hold.

05:26.301 --> 05:28.701
Good morning, Mr. Marshall.
Good morning.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.603
Welcome back.
Thank you.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.746
Thurgood,
you're going to Bridgeport.

05:39.748 --> 05:42.282
What? Now?

05:42.284 --> 05:44.284
No, I swore to Buster
I would...

05:44.286 --> 05:47.153
How many Thurgoods are there?
Five or 10? There's only one.

05:47.155 --> 05:49.889
And that one is gonna get his ass
on the train tomorrow.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.225
Why?
Why?

05:52.227 --> 05:54.827
"Nightmare in Greenwich."
That's why, Thurgood.

05:54.829 --> 05:58.965
"Wife Attacked by Negro Driver."
That's why, Thurgood.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.833
How about,
"Fear Grips Connecticut"?

06:00.835 --> 06:02.502
What's the reaction?
Fear.

06:02.504 --> 06:05.805
Getting calls from all over the country.
Negroes getting fired.

06:05.807 --> 06:08.308
White families afraid
to have us in their home.

06:08.310 --> 06:11.778
If we can't work as domestics,
Negro families are going to starve.

06:11.780 --> 06:15.181
And this is a hell of a time
to lose half of our staff.

06:16.483 --> 06:18.885
It's got everything, doesn't it?

06:20.020 --> 06:22.655
"Eleanor Strubing,

06:22.657 --> 06:24.857
fair-haired
Greenwich socialite,

06:24.859 --> 06:28.194
was the victim of a beastly attack
in her own bedroom."

06:28.196 --> 06:32.832
Yes, and the boy that they're holding
is straight out of Native Son.

06:32.834 --> 06:34.767
Look at that.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.202
Wow.

06:37.338 --> 06:39.005
"Joseph Spell.

06:40.307 --> 06:43.443
Uneducated Negro servant
with a criminal past."

06:43.445 --> 06:47.613
A fable that the New York City press
is gonna feed on to the last morsel.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.483
Yeah. They're starving for this one.
So are we.

06:50.485 --> 06:54.087
We win this thing, our big donors
are coming right back, Thurgood.

06:55.789 --> 06:58.791
There's only 13 million Negroes
depending on you.

07:15.175 --> 07:17.677
Irwin said
I would find you here.

07:17.679 --> 07:19.545
What?

07:19.547 --> 07:22.982
Your brother said I would find you here.
You know, swimming.

07:24.051 --> 07:26.519
Nice swimsuit.

07:26.521 --> 07:29.689
Who the hell are you?
Tad Lancaster.

07:29.691 --> 07:31.090
Bridgeport High.
Remember?

07:31.092 --> 07:33.693
Trombone?
Yeah!

07:33.695 --> 07:36.763
Still blowin' it too, man.
What are you doing here, Tad?

07:36.765 --> 07:41.901
Oh, I am, uh, working
with the Bridgeport NAACP.

07:41.903 --> 07:45.271
Actually, I am the Bridgeport NAACP,
and I need a little favor.

07:45.273 --> 07:47.206
Do you know that Spell case?

07:47.208 --> 07:51.077
The guy who attacked the
girl from Greenwich? Yeah.

07:51.079 --> 07:55.047
Now, National is sending a lawyer from
the city to handle his defense,

07:55.049 --> 07:57.517
and we need a local guy
to get him admitted.

08:02.856 --> 08:04.924
Uh, sorry, no.
I'm not gonna do that.

08:04.926 --> 08:07.593
- There's nothing else required.
- I'm not interested.

08:07.595 --> 08:10.596
Think about the publicity.
That's exactly what I'm thinking of.

08:10.598 --> 08:13.199
- Your brother seems to think...
- My brother is an absolute idiot.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.269
Listen, Tad, thank you so much
for thinking of me.

08:16.271 --> 08:18.471
Honestly, I'm grateful.

08:18.473 --> 08:20.807
But I don't handle
criminal cases. Okay?

08:20.809 --> 08:23.176
Find someone who wants
that kind of attention.

08:24.912 --> 08:26.846
Irwin already filed the papers
with the court.

08:29.116 --> 08:31.284
He did what?

08:31.286 --> 08:33.753
...scattered
over many parts of the country.

08:33.755 --> 08:38.558
Nazi aircraft were reported over the
south coast, the midlands... Paper, please.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.460
As well as over the London area.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.595
Thurgood Marshall.

08:42.597 --> 08:45.097
National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.

08:45.099 --> 08:48.267
Sam Friedman.
Um, Friedman and Friedman.

08:48.269 --> 08:49.735
Good to meet you, Sam.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.138
Give me a hand with these, would you?
Sure.

08:54.741 --> 08:56.609
What have you got in here?
Cement?

08:56.611 --> 08:58.211
Guns.

08:59.112 --> 09:00.613
Books, Mr. Friedman.

09:00.615 --> 09:02.982
My law library.

09:02.984 --> 09:04.984
It goes where I go.

09:04.986 --> 09:08.488
Look, I told Tad Lancaster
I'll get you admitted, as a favor.

09:08.490 --> 09:11.791
But I can't get involved with a
case like this. Yeah? Why not?

09:11.793 --> 09:15.528
Well, I do insurance defense.
You know, accident cases.

09:15.530 --> 09:17.530
I've got a reputation
to think of.

09:17.532 --> 09:19.699
Ah.

09:19.701 --> 09:22.368
That must be difficult.
What?

09:22.370 --> 09:25.938
Having a reputation to think of.

09:25.940 --> 09:29.275
You meet our client yet?
Your client. And no, I was waiting...

09:29.277 --> 09:31.544
Well, come on then.
Let's get to it.

09:36.984 --> 09:38.784
Got another one coming in.
Okay.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.853
University of Maryland
Law School.

09:40.855 --> 09:42.722
Was walking distance from home.

09:42.724 --> 09:46.459
But they didn't accept colored,
so I had to go to Howard.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.494
An hour and a half
each way by bus,

09:48.496 --> 09:50.796
and well-known
as a school for failures.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.665
That's too bad.

09:52.667 --> 09:57.203
No. No, it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

09:57.205 --> 10:00.506
They'd just brought in a new dean,
Charles Hamilton Houston.

10:00.508 --> 10:03.709
Turned that place around,
taught me everything I know,

10:03.711 --> 10:06.045
including how to sue
the University of Maryland.

10:06.047 --> 10:08.080
You sued them?

10:08.082 --> 10:11.551
You bet your ass I did.
Soon as I passed the bar.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.086
And?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.958
Supreme Court ordered the bastards
to integrate.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.698
You argued in the United States
Supreme Court?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.600
What?

10:27.602 --> 10:29.969
No, the Maryland Supreme Court.

10:32.739 --> 10:35.259
I didn't argue in front
of the US Supreme Court until last year.

10:36.276 --> 10:37.777
Your boy is ready for you.

10:54.127 --> 10:57.129
Spell.
Lawyer's here to see you.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.915
Mr. Spell, I'm Thurgood Marshall
with the NAACP.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.817
You heard of us?

11:20.087 --> 11:22.922
- You a lawyer?
- I am.

11:22.924 --> 11:25.424
This is Sam Friedman.
He's a lawyer too.

11:25.426 --> 11:28.661
You can go.
Got no money for lawyers.

11:28.663 --> 11:30.630
Anybody ask you for money?

11:32.165 --> 11:34.133
Did you rape that woman, Joseph?

11:34.135 --> 11:35.768
No.

11:35.770 --> 11:38.337
Why does she say you did?
I don't know.

11:38.339 --> 11:40.503
She says you raped her
and tried to kill her.

11:40.515 --> 11:41.515
She's lying.

11:42.409 --> 11:44.510
I was up in White Plains,
at a club.

11:44.512 --> 11:47.313
Come on, Joseph.
All night long?

11:47.315 --> 11:50.016
No, not all night.

11:50.018 --> 11:53.519
I was at the house but couldn't sleep,
so I went to play cards.

11:53.521 --> 11:56.522
Got back
maybe 6:00, 6:30.

11:56.524 --> 11:58.758
Anybody see you at the club?

11:58.760 --> 12:01.827
Yeah, but I don't know
their names or nothin'.

12:01.829 --> 12:05.264
For an alibi defense,
you need witnesses, Joseph.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.933
Otherwise it's her word
against yours.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.403
And who do you think
they're gonna believe?

12:11.171 --> 12:13.105
There was a cop.

12:15.275 --> 12:18.811
A cop? Stopped me in Port Chester
on the way to the club.

12:18.813 --> 12:21.514
Looked at my license, then let me go.
What time was that?

12:21.516 --> 12:25.084
I don't know.
Maybe 3:00 in the morning.

12:26.887 --> 12:29.955
I'm telling you this up front.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.392
The NAACP,
we're not like most lawyers.

12:33.394 --> 12:35.461
We only represent
innocent people,

12:35.463 --> 12:37.463
people accused
because of their race.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.932
That's our mission.
You understand?

12:41.468 --> 12:43.703
So I need to know this...
Look at me now.

12:45.138 --> 12:46.972
Did you do
what they said you did?

12:49.009 --> 12:51.444
I never touched that woman.

12:54.147 --> 12:56.415
Okay, Joseph.

12:56.417 --> 12:57.417
You got lawyers now.

13:13.067 --> 13:15.034
Go ahead.
Change the station.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.172
What do you know
about the prosecutor?

13:20.174 --> 13:22.174
Lorin Willis.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.777
Graduated Yale
the day he was born.

13:24.779 --> 13:27.379
Unless you came over on the Mayflower,
you're nothing to him.

13:27.381 --> 13:30.382
They're grooming him
to be senator, I hear.

13:30.384 --> 13:33.285
What do you know about the judge?
Judge Foster?

13:35.088 --> 13:37.156
Former law partner
of Willis's father.

13:46.466 --> 13:49.368
I'll move
your admission Monday morning, and then...

13:49.370 --> 13:52.238
Back to fighting off
those insurance claims.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.006
Yeah, I know.

14:08.588 --> 14:11.824
Ah. So you like
Langston Hughes, huh?

14:11.826 --> 14:13.559
Of course.
Don't you?

14:13.561 --> 14:16.428
I don't give a damn
about no poetry.

14:16.430 --> 14:18.998
Come on.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.801
I actually went to school
with Langston.

14:21.803 --> 14:24.937
I just wish he'd do something
more worthwhile with his time.

14:24.939 --> 14:28.140
Another bourbon, Mr. Marshall?
Sure.

14:28.142 --> 14:31.944
You know, Tad's got a law degree too.
From Fordham.

14:31.946 --> 14:35.080
You told me you were a driver.
Yep.

14:35.082 --> 14:39.952
The state of Connecticut decided to
not allow me a license to practice law.

14:39.954 --> 14:43.155
They were generous enough
to give me a driver's license, however.

14:43.957 --> 14:46.792
I see.

14:46.794 --> 14:48.928
What about you, Irene?

14:48.930 --> 14:51.797
What are you gonna be when you grow up?
A nurse like your mother?

14:51.799 --> 14:54.366
No.
A lawyer then?

14:54.368 --> 14:57.837
No.
A fighter pilot.

14:57.839 --> 14:59.939
A fighter pilot?

15:01.341 --> 15:04.677
Well, I feel a whole lot
more safe knowing that.

15:04.679 --> 15:08.080
All right, say good night
to Mr. Marshall, Renie.

15:09.316 --> 15:11.283
Good night.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.886
You got kids?

15:13.888 --> 15:17.223
Uh, Buster and I have been trying
for a while.

15:17.225 --> 15:21.160
Buster is my wife. Sometimes people
think I'm talking about my dog.

15:21.162 --> 15:24.797
You should get a dog and name it "Mrs.
Marshall." Ah!

15:24.799 --> 15:27.733
So, you think this boy did it?

15:29.069 --> 15:31.036
Hey, whose side you on?

15:31.038 --> 15:34.807
Women don't just go around
lying about being raped, Mr. Marshall.

15:34.809 --> 15:37.710
You're going to have to figure out
why she'd do such a thing.

15:37.712 --> 15:40.212
Burden of proof is on the State.
Is it now?

15:40.214 --> 15:42.848
Hey there.

15:42.850 --> 15:45.751
So what can you tell me
about this Friedman guy anyway?

15:45.753 --> 15:48.921
Sam and me played trombone together
in the high school band.

15:48.923 --> 15:51.490
You trust him? Sam? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

15:51.492 --> 15:55.594
If you dropped a nickel while kicking him
in the balls, he'd return it to you.

15:55.596 --> 15:57.663
Mmm.

15:59.232 --> 16:01.767
Couldn't play trombone
for shit though.

16:01.769 --> 16:04.737
Gentlemen! Can I have a minute, please?

16:04.739 --> 16:07.373
Just a minute!
Who is this, a relative of Spell?

16:07.375 --> 16:09.842
I'm Mr. Spell's attorney.
Thurgood Marshall.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.410
I thought you were
Spell's lawyer, Mr. Freeman.

16:11.412 --> 16:15.414
It's Friedman.
Sam Friedman.

16:15.416 --> 16:18.083
Of Friedman and Friedman.
Local counsel. That is all.

16:18.085 --> 16:20.552
- The defense team, huh?
- Is your boy innocent, Mr. Friedman?

16:20.554 --> 16:25.057
He is not my... Let me state this to
you all clearly and unequivocally.

16:25.059 --> 16:28.961
Our client, Joseph Spell,
is an innocent man.

16:28.963 --> 16:31.497
Well, let's get
a picture of you two.

17:00.593 --> 17:02.027
All rise.

17:03.396 --> 17:05.631
Superior Court
is now in session.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.733
The Honorable Carl Foster
presiding.

17:13.306 --> 17:16.075
You may be seated.

17:18.478 --> 17:22.181
The State of Connecticut
v. Joseph Spell.

17:22.183 --> 17:24.116
Are the parties
ready to proceed?

17:24.117 --> 17:26.318
The State is ready,
Your Honor.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.988
Ah, Mr. Willis.
Good morning.

17:28.990 --> 17:30.956
How's your father doing?

17:30.958 --> 17:33.759
He's better. Thank you.
That's kind of you to ask.

17:35.295 --> 17:38.330
Uh, the defense is ready as well,
Your Honor.

17:38.332 --> 17:40.232
Well then, let's get on with it.

17:41.301 --> 17:43.435
Mr., uh...

17:43.437 --> 17:45.537
Mr. Friedman.

17:45.539 --> 17:48.707
You filed an application to admit
an out-of-state attorney?

17:48.709 --> 17:52.544
Yes, Your Honor. Attorney Thurgood
Marshall of the Maryland Bar.

17:52.546 --> 17:55.681
I have the application
in front of me, Mr. Friedman.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.083
Uh-huh.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.856
Why do we need to admit this lawyer,
Mr. Friedman?

18:03.858 --> 18:06.558
Does he have a long-standing relationship
with the defendant?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.694
Uh, no, Your Honor,
uh, but...

18:08.696 --> 18:11.630
- How long has he known him?
- Not long, Your Honor, but...

18:11.632 --> 18:13.232
Exactly how long?

18:14.701 --> 18:18.370
Well, he met him for the first time
a few days ago.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.339
However...

18:20.341 --> 18:22.574
A few days ago?

18:22.576 --> 18:26.578
Well, then what possible reason
could there be to admit him?

18:26.580 --> 18:30.382
You're a perfectly capable attorney,
are you not, Mr. Friedman?

18:30.384 --> 18:32.818
You have tried cases before,
haven't you?

18:32.820 --> 18:36.221
Only civil cases, Your Honor.
But Mr. Marshall is with the NAACP.

18:36.223 --> 18:39.491
And they are concerned that their defendant
receive a fair trial.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.261
So are we all,
Attorney Friedman.

18:42.263 --> 18:43.896
So are we all.

18:43.898 --> 18:45.864
But he's not a member
of our bar, is he?

18:45.866 --> 18:47.766
No, he's not.

18:47.768 --> 18:50.769
However, Your Honor,
Mr. Marshall is a respected attorney.

18:50.771 --> 18:52.938
He argued in the United States
Supreme Court.

18:52.940 --> 18:54.840
That has no bearing
on this case.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.742
Your Honor, may I be heard?

18:56.744 --> 18:58.944
No, you may not.

19:00.213 --> 19:02.014
The court has heard enough
and will rule.

19:06.419 --> 19:08.454
The court sees
no legal requirement

19:08.456 --> 19:10.722
to admit out-of-state counsel
in this case.

19:10.724 --> 19:13.025
But, Your Honor...
However,

19:13.027 --> 19:16.095
the court not only wishes to be fair
to all of the parties,

19:16.097 --> 19:19.531
but to maintain the appearance of fairness
as well.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.601
Therefore, the court
will allow Mr. Marshall

19:22.603 --> 19:24.636
to enter his appearance
for the defense...

19:24.638 --> 19:26.038
Respectfully...

19:26.040 --> 19:29.308
His written appearance,
Mr. Willis.

19:29.310 --> 19:32.111
Mr. Marshall
may sit at counsel table.

19:32.113 --> 19:35.447
However, he may not speak.

19:35.449 --> 19:38.083
Your Honor,
I must speak for the client.

19:38.085 --> 19:41.620
He may not speak, argue,
or examine witnesses.

19:41.622 --> 19:45.757
If he violates this ruling,
he will be held in contempt of court.

19:45.759 --> 19:48.093
And you as well,
Mr. Friedman.

19:48.095 --> 19:50.462
You will conduct this case.

19:50.464 --> 19:52.798
Me?
Yes, you.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.901
The trial will begin
a month from today

19:55.903 --> 19:57.002
at 10:00 a.m.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.471
Court adjourned.

19:59.473 --> 20:02.007
All rise.

20:02.009 --> 20:03.509
What the...

20:03.511 --> 20:05.911
What the hell just happened?

20:05.913 --> 20:09.114
What just happened here?
Shut up and be quiet. Let me think.

20:09.116 --> 20:11.016
I can't do this. You know that.
Shut up.

20:11.018 --> 20:12.584
Excuse me?

20:15.622 --> 20:17.222
That son of a bitch.

20:19.259 --> 20:23.095
I've tried cases before judges
who were Grand Dragons of the Ku Klux Klan,

20:23.097 --> 20:25.764
who forced me to enter
through the back door,

20:25.766 --> 20:27.799
but this horseshit is a first.

20:27.801 --> 20:30.269
I cannot get involved
in a case like this.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.838
Are you listening to me?
It would destroy my practice.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.873
This is not my problem.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.241
The hell it isn't.

20:38.311 --> 20:41.380
No, you heard the judge.

20:41.382 --> 20:45.050
Until we can find somebody better,
it's you and me.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.955
It's our problem now.

20:51.024 --> 20:52.858
Uh, Mr. Marshall...

21:09.342 --> 21:11.243
According to
Eleanor Strubing's account,

21:11.245 --> 21:16.215
Spell rapes her at home,
ties and gags her, then drives up here.

21:16.217 --> 21:19.985
He stops approximately 60 feet
onto the bridge, like so...

21:19.987 --> 21:23.322
Joseph! Please!

21:23.324 --> 21:25.290
Takes her out of the car...

21:26.426 --> 21:28.794
No! No!

21:30.330 --> 21:32.197
then pushes her
over the guardrail,

21:32.199 --> 21:34.333
into the reservoir,
right about here.

21:38.871 --> 21:42.774
He throws rocks at her,
then drives away.

21:42.776 --> 21:44.676
Somehow she gets to shore.

21:46.212 --> 21:48.447
Dripping wet.

21:48.449 --> 21:50.782
Then climbs up to the road.

22:00.893 --> 22:02.361
Ah.

22:03.796 --> 22:05.931
Awfully scary down there though.

22:09.702 --> 22:11.670
Go take a look
where she climbed out.

22:13.039 --> 22:15.173
Me? These are
my best shoes.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.145
Please try to
make yourself useful.

23:06.492 --> 23:08.627
Stop. Stop!

23:10.531 --> 23:12.097
Stop.

23:13.966 --> 23:16.935
This is where
the truck driver found her.

23:28.548 --> 23:30.282
What do you want with those?

23:30.284 --> 23:33.852
It's an old Negro superstition.

23:33.854 --> 23:36.455
Always take a little piece
of the earth with you.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.357
Really?

23:49.636 --> 23:52.771
Mr. Friedman, your picture's
on the front page with Mr. Marshall.

23:56.476 --> 23:59.678
Oh.
Not a bad picture.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.680
Of me, anyway.

24:01.682 --> 24:05.016
- Also, your wife called.
- Oh, Sam. Perfect.

24:05.018 --> 24:05.765
Where you been?

24:05.777 --> 24:08.053
Out getting the cutlery
I need to castrate you.

24:08.055 --> 24:10.555
You must be Irwin.
I am.

24:10.557 --> 24:12.491
Mr. Marshall. Pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.559
Sam, listen, I have great news.

24:14.561 --> 24:16.928
I made some calls.
Harry Gruber, he wants the case.

24:16.930 --> 24:19.531
Harry Gruber.
The Communist.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.733
Sam, at least he handles
criminal defense.

24:28.274 --> 24:30.375
Can you get Gruber
on the line, Ruth?

24:30.377 --> 24:31.910
Sure thing.
Thank you.

24:31.912 --> 24:34.579
This is not
a cut-and-dry case.

24:34.581 --> 24:38.917
You should really consider whether or not
this is something you want to commit to.

24:38.919 --> 24:41.186
You want the Communist Party
taking over?

24:41.188 --> 24:43.355
They'll martyr Spell
for their own cause.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.624
Not my problem.

24:45.626 --> 24:48.727
You think he did it.
That's for a jury to decide.

24:48.729 --> 24:53.131
You think he raped this woman
and drove her to the reservoir to kill her?

24:53.133 --> 24:55.801
People have done
stranger things.

24:55.803 --> 24:59.438
That's right. People do all sorts
of strange things, horrible things.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.974
But throw a woman over the bridge, into the
water, not check to see if she's dead,

25:02.976 --> 25:05.143
then drive back to her house?

25:05.145 --> 25:07.612
You've gotta have a pretty dim view
of Negroes

25:07.614 --> 25:10.782
to think any one of us would do anything
so goddamn stupid.

25:16.756 --> 25:19.991
The papers say he was dishonorably
discharged from the army.

25:19.993 --> 25:22.561
This isn't
a court-martial.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.629
He was fired from his last job
for stealing.

25:24.631 --> 25:26.598
No charges were brought.

25:26.600 --> 25:30.302
He left behind a wife
and two kids in Louisiana, Thurgood.

25:30.304 --> 25:33.505
Yes, he's got baggage.
Criminal defendants usually do.

25:33.507 --> 25:36.741
They're not perfect citizens
like you and me.

25:36.743 --> 25:39.478
But none of that makes him guilty
of this crime.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.614
I got Gruber on the phone.
What do you want me to tell him?

25:42.616 --> 25:44.649
I don't know.
Tell him he's a schmuck.

25:44.651 --> 25:47.486
- Sam, come on.
- Irwin! Genug, huh?

25:49.790 --> 25:52.457
Why me?

25:52.459 --> 25:54.793
I need someone who will do
as I say.

25:54.795 --> 25:57.329
What makes you think
I will do as you say?

25:57.331 --> 26:00.131
You have no choice.
You don't know what you're doing.

26:00.133 --> 26:02.501
You're quite a salesman.

26:02.503 --> 26:04.169
There's no time for that.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.974
You want me to try this case.

26:08.976 --> 26:12.277
No, I need you to try this case.

26:13.946 --> 26:17.649
"And the Lord commanded Moses
to enlist his brother's help.

26:17.651 --> 26:19.885
He shall speak for you
to the people."

26:19.887 --> 26:21.853
"He shall be your mouth,

26:21.855 --> 26:24.189
and you shall be
as God to him."

26:32.231 --> 26:34.099
Tell Gruber to go fuck himself.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.501
All right.

26:36.503 --> 26:39.137
And find the cop who stopped Spell.
We need a witness.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.072
Okay. I'm on it.

26:44.744 --> 26:46.711
What is this?

26:46.713 --> 26:50.181
You say you've never tried
a criminal case before, right?

26:50.183 --> 26:52.083
Yeah, that's right.

26:52.085 --> 26:53.365
You'd better start reading then.

26:56.556 --> 26:58.156
You've got one month.

27:09.435 --> 27:12.737
Hey, look who's back.
You coming tonight?

27:12.739 --> 27:14.906
No, not tonight.

27:14.908 --> 27:18.009
Oh, man, I was really looking forward
to catching up with you.

27:20.780 --> 27:24.516
All right, you need to stop feeling sorry
for yourself.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.885
I am the one who's been sick...

27:26.887 --> 27:28.320
every morning...

27:29.555 --> 27:30.956
for the past month.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.857
What?

27:32.859 --> 27:35.927
You better not be lying.
Look at the bump.

27:35.929 --> 27:38.430
Oh! I see it.

27:38.432 --> 27:40.198
You see it?
Mmm!

27:41.434 --> 27:43.635
Mmm, mmm.

27:43.637 --> 27:45.604
I'm not going anywhere
after this.

27:45.606 --> 27:47.138
Hmm.

27:47.140 --> 27:48.873
What?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.543
You don't believe me.
No, I don't.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.478
I swear.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.080
You swear.

27:55.082 --> 27:57.649
I swear I swear.
Nowhere, nowhere.

27:57.651 --> 27:59.551
I swear.
Mmm!

28:07.226 --> 28:09.995
♪ Trouble in mind ♪

28:09.997 --> 28:11.830
♪ Guess I'm blue ♪

28:14.166 --> 28:16.735
♪ But I won't be blue always ♪

28:16.737 --> 28:19.237

28:19.239 --> 28:21.206
♪ In my back door someday ♪

28:22.942 --> 28:25.477
Langston, he swore
on his mother's life

28:25.479 --> 28:28.113
that he wouldn't be going
anywhere anytime soon.

28:28.115 --> 28:31.483
My mother's name was never mentioned.

28:31.485 --> 28:35.086
Well, this case is all anybody in this city
is talking about.

28:35.088 --> 28:38.823
Which only means that the inevitable loss
will be that much more devastating.

28:38.825 --> 28:41.826
Don't bet against me.
You're not even trying the case, baby.

28:41.828 --> 28:45.030
Every single word that man
utters in that courtroom will be mine.

28:45.032 --> 28:47.999
I'm just making the point
that a Negro charged with ravishment

28:48.001 --> 28:49.868
by the Greenwich gentility

28:49.870 --> 28:53.271
should probably save himself the time
and unpleasantness of a trial.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.640
Langston, maybe you should
just go back to Spain.

28:55.642 --> 28:58.009
Or back to Russia.

28:58.011 --> 29:02.047
Write your little poems,
explore big ideas with your comrades.

29:02.049 --> 29:04.683
I was fighting Fascists
in Spain.

29:04.685 --> 29:07.652
Well, you were writing about
fighting Fascists in Spain.

29:07.654 --> 29:10.355
Listen, by the time the baby comes,

29:10.357 --> 29:13.058
Thurgood's gonna be
out of a job.

29:13.060 --> 29:16.294
Do none of you
have any confidence in me?

29:16.296 --> 29:19.064
I'd say you have enough confidence
for us all,

29:19.066 --> 29:21.066
misplaced as it may be.

29:23.070 --> 29:25.970
Great to see you!

29:25.972 --> 29:28.206
God, here comes Zora.

29:28.208 --> 29:30.208
Probably leaving dinner
with Charles Lindbergh.

29:30.210 --> 29:32.343
- Don't you dare...
- Zora!

29:32.345 --> 29:34.045
Sit down!

29:34.047 --> 29:36.047
Come on over here.

29:36.049 --> 29:38.650
Zora Neale Hurston!
Hi!

29:38.652 --> 29:39.951
How y'all doin'?

29:41.253 --> 29:43.588
Langston Hughes.
Zora.

29:44.423 --> 29:45.657
Mmm.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.997
- And who is this?
- I'm August.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.200
- I've heard so much about you.
- Huh.

29:55.202 --> 29:58.336
That's funny, 'cause I haven't heard
a thing about you.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.205
Huh, Langston?

30:00.207 --> 30:02.574
♪ Oh, trouble in mind ♪

30:10.951 --> 30:12.484
You had it now, girl!

30:17.923 --> 30:20.325
Okay, guys.
We ready to go?

30:25.865 --> 30:28.433
You're still not talking to me.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.802
It's...
It's not my fault.

30:30.804 --> 30:34.105
You have no idea how persuasive
this guy can be.

30:51.624 --> 30:53.625
Shh.
Stella.

30:53.627 --> 30:55.727
What on earth is Sam thinking?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.996
With all that's going on
in the world today,

30:57.998 --> 31:00.298
we don't need this kind of attention
focused on us.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.668
Well, he wasn't looking for it, Rose.
Irwin got him involved.

31:03.670 --> 31:09.073
Well, you tell him that everybody
is terrified by what this man did.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.342
Sophie Gittelson
fired her girl today.

31:11.344 --> 31:14.412
She's been with them
for 11 years.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.148
They fired Gladys?
Why? She's lovely.

31:17.150 --> 31:19.784
Yeah, she's lovely.

31:19.786 --> 31:22.353
But what if one of her relatives
comes to visit?

31:22.355 --> 31:24.088
They have their daughter
to think of.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.025
I would've done the same thing.

31:38.771 --> 31:41.172
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Friedlansky.

31:41.174 --> 31:42.974
Mr. Weisman.

31:42.976 --> 31:46.778
Dora and I couldn't remember.
Were you born here or in Minsk?

31:46.780 --> 31:49.948
We, uh... We came over
when I was one.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.583
That's what I thought.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.856
So you feel like a really big shot, I bet,
defending that schvartze.

31:59.391 --> 32:02.227
What do you think
your father would say?

32:02.229 --> 32:04.128
I could not tell you.

32:07.466 --> 32:10.101
I think he'd say he was proud.

32:12.304 --> 32:13.771
For the defense.

32:15.207 --> 32:16.641
Don't mention it.

32:18.677 --> 32:20.211
To anyone.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.335
Eew!

32:53.779 --> 32:55.914
Jury selection, gentlemen.

32:55.916 --> 32:58.116
Clerk, call the first
venire person.

32:58.118 --> 33:00.485
Lester Gilman of Norwalk.

33:01.420 --> 33:03.688
Mr. Gilman.

33:10.062 --> 33:12.463
Mr., uh, Gilman,

33:12.465 --> 33:17.368
um, in this case a colored man is accused
of raping a white woman.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.938
Could you be fair
in deciding such a case?

33:21.206 --> 33:22.874
I think so.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.208
No further questions.

33:27.313 --> 33:29.280
Accepted by the defense.

33:29.282 --> 33:34.319
To tell you the truth, I don't know much
about them, the colored.

33:34.321 --> 33:36.688
We don't have too many
in Stratford.

33:47.399 --> 33:48.967
Excused.

33:54.073 --> 33:57.141
I'll be honest with you.
I don't like the colored.

33:57.143 --> 33:59.877
Seems to me they're always getting into
some sort of trouble.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.847
I don't think much
of Hebrews either.

34:04.116 --> 34:05.783
Excuse me?

34:05.785 --> 34:09.654
Well, you're one of them...
I figured.

34:11.357 --> 34:14.292
Thank you for your candor,
Mr. Wright.

34:14.293 --> 34:15.927
Uh, no further questions.

34:17.830 --> 34:19.197
Excuse for cause.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.132
Counselor?

34:21.134 --> 34:25.268
Your Honor, we move to have Mr. Wright
excused for cause.

34:25.271 --> 34:27.138
On what grounds?

34:27.139 --> 34:28.773
- Bias.
- I know.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.208
He just admitted he's biased.

34:31.643 --> 34:34.379
Mr. Wright, you are
a law-abiding citizen.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.647
Wouldn't you say?
That's right, Your Honor.

34:36.649 --> 34:41.886
If I instructed you that the law requires
that you set aside your bias,

34:41.888 --> 34:43.755
would you obey my instruction?

34:44.690 --> 34:46.157
Guess I'd have to.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.793
The challenge for cause
is overruled.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.527
You may use
the peremptory challenge.

34:50.530 --> 34:52.929
- Your Honor, with all due respect...
- I've made my ruling.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.237
Excused.

34:59.239 --> 35:01.406
Mr. Ellis,
you agree, do you not,

35:01.408 --> 35:05.176
that as a colored man you could not fairly
pass judgment on Mr. Spell.

35:05.178 --> 35:07.311
No, sir.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.747
You agree you could not be fair.

35:09.749 --> 35:13.117
No. What I mean is, yes, if he's guilty,
I'd have to convict him.

35:14.353 --> 35:16.721
I'll use a challenge.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.556
Object.

35:18.558 --> 35:20.491
On what basis?
Just do it.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.026
Uh, Your Honor, I object.

35:22.028 --> 35:23.995
Grounds?

35:23.997 --> 35:26.931
He can't use the challenge to discrim...

35:26.933 --> 35:28.766
I heard that,
Mr. Marshall.

35:28.768 --> 35:31.869
It's a peremptory challenge,
Mr. Friedman.

35:31.871 --> 35:34.005
The State may use it
for whatever reason it wants.

35:35.574 --> 35:38.042
Mr. Willis, you have four left.
The defense has one.

35:38.044 --> 35:40.111
What was the point of that?

35:40.113 --> 35:43.448
Every single time they discriminate,
we're going to object.

35:43.450 --> 35:45.883
Recognize it.
Now.

35:45.885 --> 35:48.519
Mrs. Richmond,
do you reside in Greenwich?

35:48.521 --> 35:50.655
Yes, Mr. Willis.
I do now.

35:51.924 --> 35:53.925
And if the State
proves its case,

35:53.927 --> 35:55.860
you could convict the defendant?

35:55.862 --> 35:58.329
Yes, of course I could.

36:00.065 --> 36:03.334
Thank you, Mrs. Richmond.
That's all I wanted to know.

36:09.741 --> 36:13.878
Mrs. Richmond, I notice you have
an accent.

36:13.880 --> 36:19.117
Really? Here I thought you were the one
with the accent, Mr. Friedman.

36:19.119 --> 36:20.351
Fair enough.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.387
Mrs. Richmond,

36:23.389 --> 36:25.289
where did you live
before moving here?

36:25.291 --> 36:27.225
Raleigh, North Carolina.

36:27.227 --> 36:30.294
But now you live in Greenwich.
Yes, that's right.

36:30.296 --> 36:33.164
So if you live in Greenwich,
you must have heard about this case.

36:33.166 --> 36:36.167
It's all anybody talks about.

36:36.169 --> 36:40.171
I assume, then, that you've come
to some sort of conclusion

36:40.173 --> 36:42.206
regarding the defendant's guilt
or innocence?

36:43.275 --> 36:45.276
You assume incorrectly.

36:45.278 --> 36:47.678
I don't have all the evidence,
now, do I?

36:47.680 --> 36:50.081
Have you met
Mrs. Strubing?

36:50.083 --> 36:53.618
In passing, at parties
and community events.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.120
I believe we belong
to the same club.

36:56.122 --> 36:58.956
Do you really think then,
Mrs. Richmond,

36:58.958 --> 37:02.860
that with all of these connections...
the club, the parties...

37:02.862 --> 37:05.463
that you could really
just set all of that aside?

37:05.465 --> 37:08.266
I don't see why not.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.402
Thank you.
No further questions.

37:14.873 --> 37:16.908
The State accepts
Mrs. Richmond.

37:18.377 --> 37:20.011
Your Honor...
What?

37:20.013 --> 37:21.512
No. Absolutely not.

37:21.514 --> 37:24.215
Mr. Friedman.

37:24.217 --> 37:28.119
Your Honor, may we have five minutes,
please?

37:30.956 --> 37:32.890
Fine with me, Your Honor.

37:32.892 --> 37:35.560
The court will recess
for exactly five minutes.

37:35.562 --> 37:37.962
But we're not gonna make a habit of this,
are we, counselor?

37:37.964 --> 37:40.531
No. No, of course not.
Thank you, Your Honor.

37:43.703 --> 37:46.571
We have one challenge left.
It was made for this woman.

37:46.573 --> 37:48.306
Just trust me on this.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.308
She's a Southerner.
Lives in the same town.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.076
Take her.
I'm not your goddamn puppet.

37:52.078 --> 37:53.711
I'm getting rid of her.

37:53.713 --> 37:57.048
She's smart, she's confident,
she resists authority.

37:57.050 --> 37:59.584
Did you see the way
she talked back to you?

37:59.586 --> 38:02.553
The other jurors will listen to her.
Which is exactly the problem.

38:02.555 --> 38:05.489
She knows Mrs. Strubing.
They run in the same social circles.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.425
And she doesn't
put her on a pedestal.

38:07.427 --> 38:10.428
Maybe Mrs. Strubing
is a drinker.

38:10.430 --> 38:14.265
Maybe she has a boyfriend in town.
This woman may know things.

38:14.267 --> 38:16.734
You are stabbing in the dark.

38:16.736 --> 38:19.670
Maybe, but this I do know.

38:19.672 --> 38:23.441
The one thing Southerners like her hate
more than the colored...

38:23.443 --> 38:25.309
arrogant Yankee pricks
like Willis.

38:26.612 --> 38:29.347
Were you watching her?

38:29.349 --> 38:32.583
She folded her arms and sat back
when Willis spoke.

38:32.585 --> 38:35.353
When you began, she opened up,

38:35.355 --> 38:38.889
leaned forward,
removed her glasses.

38:38.891 --> 38:41.125
These are signs.

38:41.127 --> 38:42.593
Signs of what?

38:43.695 --> 38:45.162
She likes you.

38:53.038 --> 38:55.072
No, my gl...
my glasses!

38:55.074 --> 38:56.841
I need my glasses.

39:02.247 --> 39:04.181
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah.

39:12.624 --> 39:14.692
Mr. Friedman?

39:16.561 --> 39:18.396
The defendant
accepts Mrs. Richmond.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.899
Am I missing something?

39:21.901 --> 39:25.736
Mrs. Richmond, you've been accepted
by both of the parties

39:25.738 --> 39:29.307
and will serve as
our 12th and final juror.

39:29.309 --> 39:32.310
The evidence will begin tomorrow
morning at 10:00.

39:32.312 --> 39:35.646
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Mr. Friedman!
Mr. Friedman.

39:35.648 --> 39:38.616
What do you have to say
about today's comments by the NAACP?

39:38.618 --> 39:41.585
- What comments?
- The press release by Walter White?

39:41.587 --> 39:43.954
He says that, "The Spell case
will show the world

39:43.956 --> 39:46.657
that a colored man cannot get a fair
trial in the United States of America."

39:46.659 --> 39:48.926
- Do you agree, Mr. Friedman?
- I have nothing to say about that.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.661
What about you,
Mr. Marshall?

39:50.663 --> 39:53.931
Hasn't it been proven
in this courtroom already?

39:56.536 --> 40:00.338
How can a man have a fair trial
when he's denied counsel of his choice?

40:00.340 --> 40:04.108
When the members of his race
are eliminated from service on his jury?

40:04.110 --> 40:08.179
When fear and bias against his race are the
central points of the case against him?

40:08.181 --> 40:10.348
In Europe right now,

40:11.817 --> 40:14.151
the forces of tyranny
have mobilized

40:14.153 --> 40:18.155
behind the vision
of a so-called master race.

40:18.157 --> 40:22.193
But here in America,
our differences aren't supposed to matter.

40:22.195 --> 40:26.297
Here we're promised
equal protection under the law.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.032
Separate but equal!

40:28.034 --> 40:30.134
Nothing complicated about that.

40:30.136 --> 40:34.739
That promise has not been realized,
not even close.

40:34.741 --> 40:39.076
Not in Birmingham, Alabama,
nor in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,

40:39.078 --> 40:41.645
and certainly not here
in Bridgeport, Connecticut...

40:43.850 --> 40:47.785
where your bigotry is simply covered
by a northern accent.

40:50.155 --> 40:53.491
But a fair jury can always
render a just verdict.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.593
That's what we're striving for
here today.

40:55.595 --> 40:59.063
The Constitution was not written for us.
We know that.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.499
But no matter what,
we're gonna make it work for us.

41:01.501 --> 41:05.202
From now on
we claim it as our own.

41:23.088 --> 41:24.422
What's bothering you?

41:24.424 --> 41:26.023
Sam.
Not now.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.958
What's bothering me?

41:27.960 --> 41:31.128
You insulting the judge on the courthouse
steps. That's what's bothering me.

41:31.130 --> 41:34.198
Just relax.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.467
Excuse me?

41:36.469 --> 41:39.036
I have to live in this city
after you're gone. Understand?

41:39.038 --> 41:41.639
No more public statements
until this trial is over, or I'm gone.

41:41.641 --> 41:43.541
Let me make this clear.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.544
My people will decide what to say
to the newspapers and when to say it.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.913
The newspapers should have
no place in this trial.

41:48.915 --> 41:51.582
But they already do. People are losing
their jobs because of these stories.

41:51.584 --> 41:53.751
- Those people are not my clients!
- Well, they are mine!

41:53.753 --> 41:58.622
My jury isn't just the 12 people in that
jury box. It's the whole goddamn nation.

41:58.624 --> 42:01.467
You just focus on this
case, try your best not

42:01.479 --> 42:04.395
to screw it up and leave
the big picture to me.

42:04.397 --> 42:07.064
Sam.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.667
What is it, Irwin?
Don't you have something to do?

42:11.102 --> 42:13.070
There's someone waiting for you
in my office.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.272
Yes?
And who is this someone?

42:15.274 --> 42:17.341
Uh, Officer McCoy.

42:17.343 --> 42:20.110
And who the hell
is Officer McCoy?

42:20.112 --> 42:22.913
The cop who pulled Spell over
that night.

42:33.492 --> 42:35.359
I just did what you said.

42:35.361 --> 42:39.830
I drove around Port Chester,
pulling over police cars, and I found him.

42:39.832 --> 42:42.199
Attaboy, Irwin.
Attaboy.

42:42.201 --> 42:44.268
What time did you pull over
Mr. Spell?

42:48.039 --> 42:50.174
Did you hear the question?

42:52.010 --> 42:55.613
3:37 a.m.,
according to my notes.

42:57.516 --> 42:59.083
Why'd you stop him?

43:00.819 --> 43:02.253
It didn't look like...

43:03.788 --> 43:06.123
a man like that
would drive that car.

43:08.059 --> 43:09.927
Was anyone with him in the car?

43:11.162 --> 43:13.964
No. He was alone.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.400
You're willing to
testify to that in court?

43:16.402 --> 43:19.036
If I have to.

43:19.038 --> 43:23.073
Irwin, get a sworn statement from
Officer McCoy, then escort him out.

43:23.075 --> 43:24.608
Officer.

43:31.483 --> 43:32.883
Wow.

43:33.718 --> 43:35.286
An honest policeman.

43:40.892 --> 43:43.260
See what your publicity
stirs up?

43:43.262 --> 43:46.096
No, it just brings 'em out
where you can see 'em.

43:47.699 --> 43:49.433
Give us justice!

43:49.435 --> 43:51.468
That doesn't look
anything like me.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.138
Does it?

44:04.382 --> 44:07.184
The State of Connecticut
v. Joseph Spell.

44:07.186 --> 44:08.919
Are counsel ready to proceed?

44:08.921 --> 44:11.088
Ready for the State.

44:11.090 --> 44:12.690
We are, Your Honor.

44:12.692 --> 44:15.526
Mr. Willis, you may call
your first witness.

44:15.528 --> 44:18.796
The State calls Greenwich Police
Captain Burke to the stand.

44:27.872 --> 44:30.407
Would you identify these photos,
Captain Burke?

44:30.409 --> 44:32.943
Yes, sir.
That's the Kensico Reservoir.

44:34.312 --> 44:36.647
Did you find any evidence
at the scene

44:36.649 --> 44:38.282
that pertains to this case?

44:38.284 --> 44:40.884
Yes, sir, we did.

44:40.886 --> 44:43.621
We found Mrs. Strubing's sealskin coat
floating in the reservoir,

44:43.623 --> 44:46.056
under the bridge, about here.

44:46.058 --> 44:49.927
Then about here, on the guardrail,
we found some strands of fabric.

44:49.929 --> 44:52.429
I believe they were stuck
to some bird droppings.

44:52.431 --> 44:55.432
Were you able to
identify the fabric?

44:55.434 --> 44:59.303
Yes, sir. It matched the fabric
from Mrs. Strubing's sealskin coat.

45:01.673 --> 45:03.974
Thank you.
Nothing further.

45:06.111 --> 45:07.978
Your witness,
Mr. Friedman.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.087
Bird droppings.

45:17.989 --> 45:19.256
Sorry?

45:19.258 --> 45:22.960
Uh, bird droppings,
Captain Burke?

45:22.962 --> 45:24.395
Yes, that's right.

45:25.697 --> 45:28.298
Were you able to
identify the bird?

45:30.935 --> 45:33.270
May I?

45:33.272 --> 45:34.972
Thank you.

45:34.974 --> 45:37.141
Now...

45:37.143 --> 45:41.679
on one side of the bridge is the reservoir,
placid as a lake.

45:41.681 --> 45:47.484
On the other side is a 30-foot drop
onto a jagged rock bed.

45:47.486 --> 45:49.787
- Is that correct?
- You could say that.

45:49.789 --> 45:53.057
And the fabric that you found
was on the lake side,

45:53.059 --> 45:55.459
right about here,

45:55.461 --> 45:57.528
around 60 feet onto the bridge.

45:57.530 --> 45:59.830
Sixty-seven feet,
four inches.

45:59.832 --> 46:01.865
Okay.

46:01.867 --> 46:07.638
Did you conclude, then, that Mrs. Strubing
fell or jumped off the bridge?

46:07.640 --> 46:11.075
- I concluded that she was pushed.
- Pushed?

46:11.077 --> 46:12.743
To murder her.

46:12.745 --> 46:14.578
That's right.

46:14.580 --> 46:19.149
As a trained
crime investigator, Captain,

46:19.151 --> 46:21.018
did you ever ask yourself,

46:21.020 --> 46:24.188
if someone wanted
Mrs. Strubing dead,

46:24.190 --> 46:28.525
why not push her onto the sharp, jagged
rock bed rather than the still lake water?

46:28.527 --> 46:31.395
Object.
Asking for speculation.

46:31.397 --> 46:34.932
Sustained. The jury will
disregard the question.

46:36.835 --> 46:39.870
Now...
Mrs. Strubing told you

46:39.872 --> 46:43.307
that after pushing her
into the water,

46:44.542 --> 46:46.777
Joseph threw rocks at her
from the bridge.

46:46.779 --> 46:48.712
Is that correct?
Yes.

46:48.714 --> 46:51.515
Mm-hmm.
Were there any rocks on the bridge?

46:52.617 --> 46:55.018
I don't know.
There may have been.

46:55.020 --> 46:57.921
But there were rocks in the area
around the bridge. Is that correct?

46:57.923 --> 46:59.590
Yes, there were.

46:59.592 --> 47:02.226
About how big were they?

47:02.228 --> 47:04.128
I really couldn't say.

47:09.367 --> 47:10.667
Were they...

47:12.570 --> 47:14.872
any bigger than this, Captain?

47:18.276 --> 47:20.177
I can't say they were.

47:28.553 --> 47:32.055
This... This is a pebble,
isn't it, Captain?

47:32.057 --> 47:33.857
You could call it that.

47:35.493 --> 47:36.794
What would you call it?

47:39.097 --> 47:40.631
A pebble.

47:43.469 --> 47:46.637
A pebble.

47:46.639 --> 47:50.808
So, in summary, Captain,

47:50.810 --> 47:53.610
it is your belief that this man

47:53.612 --> 47:57.848
threw Mrs. Strubing
into a placid lake,

47:57.850 --> 48:00.851
then gathered pebbles
to toss at her

48:00.853 --> 48:03.086
while she waited patiently
under the bridge.

48:03.088 --> 48:05.088
Object.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.191
Withdrawn.

48:07.193 --> 48:09.860
No further questions,
Your Honor.

48:09.862 --> 48:12.129
Captain Burke, you are excused.

48:12.131 --> 48:14.097
Court is adjourned.

48:14.099 --> 48:15.399
All rise.

48:19.337 --> 48:20.737
Mr. Friedman.

48:21.973 --> 48:24.074
Well done.

48:24.976 --> 48:27.277
Well done.
Let's go.

48:28.980 --> 48:31.114
Why are you smiling?

48:31.116 --> 48:33.951
I think we scored
some points there.

48:33.953 --> 48:36.386
This isn't a sporting event.

48:36.388 --> 48:38.722
A man's life is on the line.

48:38.724 --> 48:40.490
A word with you, Friedman.

48:40.492 --> 48:42.459
Yes, of course.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.861
Alone.

48:45.129 --> 48:47.331
Or to you both.

48:47.333 --> 48:50.734
The doctor who examined Ellie
is testifying tomorrow.

48:50.736 --> 48:53.570
It's rather personal, of course.

48:53.572 --> 48:54.872
These are private people...

48:54.874 --> 48:56.974
Please get to the point.

48:56.976 --> 48:58.308
Excuse me?

49:00.211 --> 49:03.213
I've spoken with John Strubing,
and he's willing to consider a plea.

49:03.215 --> 49:04.882
It's my decision, of course,

49:04.884 --> 49:07.551
but plead your boy and I'll recommend
a sentence of 20 years.

49:07.553 --> 49:09.453
- Otherwise, he gets life.
- No.

49:10.588 --> 49:12.489
No deals.

49:14.192 --> 49:16.126
Mr. Friedman?

49:17.395 --> 49:19.363
Not my call.

49:19.365 --> 49:21.832
Of course. You have to
speak to your client.

49:21.834 --> 49:24.301
I'll expect a different answer
in the morning.

49:28.773 --> 49:30.507
Even with good behavior,

49:30.509 --> 49:32.910
you'd be locked up
at least 14 years.

49:34.712 --> 49:36.647
I could maybe do that.

49:40.184 --> 49:42.352
They don't know we found the cop,
Joseph.

49:43.688 --> 49:45.756
We don't even know
if Strubing will show up.

49:45.758 --> 49:48.859
- You could walk out of here a free man.
- But if she does...

49:48.861 --> 49:50.360
- If you wrong...
- Listen.

49:50.362 --> 49:52.663
The decision is yours.
Sam.

49:54.132 --> 49:56.566
I need to talk to Joseph.

49:56.568 --> 49:59.770
- Are you asking me to leave?
- Of course not.

49:59.772 --> 50:01.939
He's your client.

50:01.941 --> 50:03.840
I'm asking you to listen.

50:08.780 --> 50:11.148
When we first met,

50:11.150 --> 50:13.175
I told you I'd only
defend you if you were

50:13.187 --> 50:15.319
innocent, and you told
me you were innocent.

50:15.321 --> 50:18.422
You remember?
I remember.

50:18.424 --> 50:21.391
Did you lie to me?
No, I didn't lie.

50:21.393 --> 50:25.195
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Did you commit this crime?

50:26.464 --> 50:29.633
No.
But you're willing to say you did.

50:29.635 --> 50:31.969
If I got to.
For the deal.

50:31.971 --> 50:33.837
If you "got to"?

50:39.243 --> 50:41.912
My great-granddaddy
was a slave.

50:44.182 --> 50:46.216
Were your people slaves, Joseph?

50:47.785 --> 50:50.854
When we were slaves we had to do
what the master said.

50:50.856 --> 50:53.824
But... we're not slaves now,
are we?

50:53.826 --> 50:56.159
No, we ain't slaves.

50:56.161 --> 50:58.295
You say that like it's nothin'.

50:58.297 --> 51:02.599
We ain't slaves because we rose up and
we fought and we fought and we fought

51:02.601 --> 51:04.234
till we got our freedom.

51:05.303 --> 51:07.204
Isn't that right?

51:09.107 --> 51:11.675
My granddaddy escaped
when he was 15.

51:13.177 --> 51:16.179
Fought off four men and an attack dog,
my mama said.

51:16.181 --> 51:19.649
Okay, then you tell me this.

51:19.651 --> 51:22.352
After what your granddaddy did
to get his freedom,

51:22.354 --> 51:25.889
you're just gonna give it right back
for nothing,

51:25.891 --> 51:27.758
for something
you didn't even do?

51:29.327 --> 51:31.194
Understand this.

51:31.196 --> 51:34.865
If you want your freedom,
you're gonna have to fight for it.

51:34.867 --> 51:37.634
But you don't have to fight alone.
That's why I'm here.

51:38.870 --> 51:41.138
We've got weapons now, Joseph.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.673
Our people do.

51:43.675 --> 51:45.575
Weapons we didn't have before.

51:48.546 --> 51:50.480
We've got the law.

51:51.649 --> 51:54.751
And you've got Sam,

51:54.753 --> 51:59.923
one of the finest young trial lawyers
in this country, on your side.

52:03.327 --> 52:05.162
You really think we can win?

52:07.365 --> 52:10.133
I wouldn't be here if I didn't think
we could win.

52:14.205 --> 52:16.973
Dr. Sayer, please tell the jury
your field of specialty.

52:18.209 --> 52:20.877
I specialize
in the field of gynecology,

52:20.879 --> 52:24.247
and I deliver babies.

52:24.249 --> 52:24.912
Aww!

52:24.924 --> 52:26.950
On the morning she was
discovered in the reservoir,

52:26.952 --> 52:30.887
did you have occasion to examine
Mrs. Eleanor Strubing?

52:30.889 --> 52:32.589
Yes.

52:32.591 --> 52:35.525
She was brought to my home
by the police at, uh...

52:36.694 --> 52:39.830
Let's see.
6:30 in the morning.

52:40.898 --> 52:42.666
Did she tell you
what had happened?

52:44.235 --> 52:45.969
Objection. Hearsay.

52:45.971 --> 52:47.938
Overruled.

52:47.940 --> 52:49.372
Doctor?

52:50.374 --> 52:52.642
I've forgotten the question.

52:52.644 --> 52:54.444
What did Mrs. Strubing
tell you?

52:55.713 --> 52:58.148
She told me
that she had been raped

52:58.150 --> 53:00.183
by a colored man
who worked for her.

53:02.153 --> 53:05.956
What was her mental state
during all of this?

53:05.958 --> 53:09.893
She was severely distraught,
weeping.

53:09.895 --> 53:13.463
She kept repeating, "Am I pregnant?
Am I pregnant?"

53:14.665 --> 53:17.834
- Did you then examine her?
- Yes.

53:17.836 --> 53:20.837
My wife assisted
by removing her clothing.

53:20.839 --> 53:23.673
It was torn, wet, and muddy.

53:24.909 --> 53:28.478
I noted bruises
on her arms and legs

53:28.480 --> 53:31.381
and numerous abrasions and contusions
on both extremities.

53:32.517 --> 53:34.851
I then performed
an internal exam.

53:34.853 --> 53:38.088
Do you have an opinion,
based upon reasonable medical certainty,

53:38.090 --> 53:40.257
as to whether or not
she had been raped?

53:41.759 --> 53:43.326
Beyond question,
Mr. Willis.

53:43.328 --> 53:46.730
It was all consistent with rape.

53:48.466 --> 53:49.900
Thank you.

53:51.002 --> 53:52.669
Your witness.

53:52.671 --> 53:54.604
Get the records.

53:56.207 --> 53:58.008
Medical records.
Get them.

53:58.010 --> 54:00.210
Your Honor, may we please see
the medical records of Dr. Sayer?

54:00.212 --> 54:02.379
Object.
These are personal.

54:04.115 --> 54:05.815
Overruled.

54:05.817 --> 54:08.885
I'm sorry, Mr. Willis,
but the witness referred to them.

54:08.887 --> 54:11.254
- They must be turned over.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

54:12.490 --> 54:14.424
May I?

54:33.744 --> 54:38.415
Abrasions and contusions. Those are
scrapes and cuts, aren't they, Doctor?

54:38.417 --> 54:41.017
Yes. Scrapes,
scratches, bruises.

54:41.019 --> 54:42.886
Right.

54:42.888 --> 54:45.655
Well, the fall from the bridge and
the climb through the pine forest

54:45.657 --> 54:47.958
could be responsible for cuts and bruises,
could it not?

54:48.993 --> 54:50.227
It's possible.

55:01.072 --> 55:03.974
You did an internal exam
and you found...

55:05.343 --> 55:08.745
"edema, swelling,
traces of blood."

55:08.747 --> 55:11.248
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

55:11.250 --> 55:14.784
And it was based on this that you
determined that she was raped?

55:14.786 --> 55:16.786
Indeed.

55:16.788 --> 55:18.321
But those same findings...

55:19.757 --> 55:22.359
are equally consistent
with a woman who took a lover

55:22.361 --> 55:25.528
and engaged in vigorous sexual intercourse
over the course of an evening.

55:25.530 --> 55:28.798
Objection. How dare you.
There is no evidence of any lover.

55:28.800 --> 55:30.400
Sustained.

55:30.402 --> 55:33.370
There's no place for that in my courtroom,
Mr. Friedman.

55:34.705 --> 55:37.240
Um, of course, Your Honor.

55:37.242 --> 55:39.843
I-I'm sorry.

55:49.153 --> 55:51.721
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

55:53.057 --> 55:55.325
No, they just pulled me
out of proceedings.

55:55.327 --> 55:56.860
The baby...

55:58.596 --> 56:00.196
didn't make it.

56:02.967 --> 56:06.536
And it was just so much worse this time.
The bleeding was just...

56:07.505 --> 56:08.938
It wouldn't stop.

56:08.940 --> 56:10.240
I'm so sorry.

56:12.811 --> 56:14.844
I should be there.

56:20.251 --> 56:21.584
Buster?

56:23.788 --> 56:25.255
Buster, are you there?

56:26.324 --> 56:27.724
Yeah, I'm...

56:29.293 --> 56:30.660
I'm here.

56:32.496 --> 56:33.897
Where are you?

56:37.802 --> 56:40.103
Do you have any further questions,
Mr. Friedman?

56:58.656 --> 57:01.458
Mrs. Strubing told you
that she resisted her assailant?

57:01.460 --> 57:03.360
Yes, she did.
Mm-hmm.

57:03.362 --> 57:05.829
And you looked under her fingernails
too, didn't you,

57:05.831 --> 57:07.897
to see if you could find
any traces of skin?

57:07.899 --> 57:09.399
I did.

57:09.401 --> 57:12.202
What did you find?

57:12.204 --> 57:14.371
Splinters, dirt in some...

57:14.373 --> 57:16.506
- Any skin, Doctor?
- No, Sam.

57:16.508 --> 57:19.342
Yes. I was just
about to get to that.

57:19.344 --> 57:21.311
Excuse me?

57:21.313 --> 57:22.779
There was skin.

57:26.217 --> 57:28.685
Wh-Where...

57:28.687 --> 57:32.756
Where in these records does it say anything
about finding traces of skin?

57:32.758 --> 57:35.892
It's not in the records.

57:35.894 --> 57:39.996
My wife took the notes. She did not
write down that bit of information.

57:42.099 --> 57:44.834
Why not, Doctor?
Why would she not record that?

57:46.437 --> 57:50.340
Out of respect for the patient's privacy,
Mr. Friedman.

57:51.842 --> 57:53.943
It was the skin
of a colored man.

57:59.417 --> 58:01.618
No further questions.

58:01.620 --> 58:05.088
It wasn't in the records.
They got a doctor to lie under oath.

58:05.090 --> 58:06.656
How do we fight against that?

58:07.758 --> 58:09.793
You asked the exact question

58:09.795 --> 58:11.728
Willis wanted you to ask.

58:11.730 --> 58:14.631
- What were you thinking?
- Where the hell were you? Hmm?

58:14.633 --> 58:16.533
Getting instructions
from Walter White?

58:16.535 --> 58:19.903
See what happens when I don't hold
your hand? You panic like an amateur.

58:19.905 --> 58:22.205
You should have let him
take the deal.

58:22.207 --> 58:26.042
Goddamn it, would you shut up about
the deal? We have an alibi witness.

58:26.044 --> 58:27.610
What don't you get?

58:27.612 --> 58:31.481
They will have McCoy change his testimony.
Just watch.

58:31.483 --> 58:35.084
Let them. We'll take his sworn statement
and shove it up his ass.

58:35.086 --> 58:39.055
No, tomorrow morning I'm asking Willis
if the offer is still on the table.

58:39.057 --> 58:42.225
The NAACP
isn't taking any deals.

58:42.227 --> 58:44.978
The NAACP isn't the one with
its life on the line here.

58:44.990 --> 58:46.229
Yes, it is, goddamn it.

58:50.134 --> 58:52.802
You're using him.

58:52.804 --> 58:54.737
That's all this is.

58:54.739 --> 58:56.840
Just like you said
the Communists would.

58:56.842 --> 59:00.677
We're giving him the best possible defense
under the circumstances.

59:00.679 --> 59:02.779
Mmm. Yeah.

59:02.781 --> 59:06.749
I'm sure he'll feel really lucky as
he sits in prison for the rest of his life.

59:06.751 --> 59:09.919
Let's not act like it's Joseph Spell you're
concerned for all of a sudden.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.422
What is that supposed to mean?

59:12.424 --> 59:15.758
From the moment you got involved in this,
you've been looking for a way out.

59:15.760 --> 59:18.628
Play nice with the DA,
earn yourself a favor,

59:18.630 --> 59:21.498
maybe they'll let you in their neighborhood
or their club one day.

59:21.500 --> 59:23.700
Well, get this
through your head.

59:23.702 --> 59:26.703
The only way to get through a bigot's door
is to break it down.

59:29.173 --> 59:32.308
Must be easy
for you to say, huh?

59:32.310 --> 59:35.111
See, it's my life
that is on the line here.

59:35.113 --> 59:38.014
My family, my practice,
my future.

59:38.016 --> 59:42.886
What do you have?
You have nothing to lose.

59:42.888 --> 59:47.524
No, you just sweep through town,
stirring up all kinds of ugliness,

59:47.526 --> 59:49.459
then move right on.

59:51.028 --> 59:54.931
No one will ever
even remember you were here.

59:57.034 --> 59:59.602
Oh, fuck you, Sam.

01:00:01.505 --> 01:00:03.439
Fuck you.

01:00:22.826 --> 01:00:25.562
Hey.
You two okay?

01:00:39.009 --> 01:00:41.444
Please take the stand,
Mrs. Strubing.

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:54.857
Mrs. Strubing,
you reside in Greenwich?

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:02.532
Yes. My husband John and I moved
from Philadelphia about a year ago.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:05.535
Is your husband here
in the courtroom today?

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.136
Of course.

01:01:07.138 --> 01:01:09.038
Sitting in the front.

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:16.646
Mrs. Strubing, do you remember the night
you were attacked?

01:01:16.648 --> 01:01:19.215
Mr. Willis, I assure you,
I will never forget it.

01:01:20.985 --> 01:01:22.685
Please tell the jury
what happened.

01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:29.592
My husband was away on business,

01:01:29.594 --> 01:01:33.162
as he is often, I'm afraid.

01:01:33.164 --> 01:01:36.399
I had dinner with friends...
the Moores.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:40.803
And I arrived home
around ten o'clock

01:01:40.805 --> 01:01:44.474
and then I decided
to shower before bed.

01:01:44.476 --> 01:01:47.977
And I was fixing my hair.

01:01:49.647 --> 01:01:52.649
And he came in the room.

01:01:52.651 --> 01:01:55.318
He came after me
and started chasing me.

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:01.424
He had a knife.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.593
The knife was pointed
at my throat,

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:05.995
and I...

01:02:05.997 --> 01:02:07.930
I thought of screaming, but...

01:02:09.199 --> 01:02:10.933
I couldn't.

01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:13.202
He... He penetrated me.

01:02:14.138 --> 01:02:15.772
I couldn't make him stop.

01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:19.208
His body was crushing me.

01:02:20.544 --> 01:02:22.445
What happened next,
Mrs. Strubing?

01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:28.151
He said he wasn't finished
with me.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:32.355
And then he did it again.

01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:34.691
Did what?

01:02:37.294 --> 01:02:38.795
Raped me, Mr. Willis.

01:02:40.197 --> 01:02:42.398
And then what happened?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.303
When it was over, he said,
"We're going for a ride, Mrs. Strubing."

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.572
After all that,

01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:52.041
he still called me
"Mrs. Strubing."

01:02:53.744 --> 01:02:55.945
Then he tore my dress
with his hands...

01:02:57.514 --> 01:02:59.449
and gagged me.

01:03:00.851 --> 01:03:04.420
I show you Exhibit "H."

01:03:04.422 --> 01:03:07.690
- Is this the dress?
- Yes. That's it.

01:03:07.692 --> 01:03:11.594
And is this, Exhibit "I,"
taken from that dress,

01:03:11.596 --> 01:03:14.263
similar to the gag
he used on you?

01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:16.733
- Identical.
- Then what happened?

01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:18.501
We started driving.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:23.906
I had to lay down on the floor
so that I wasn't seen.

01:03:23.908 --> 01:03:27.110
He came around,
pulled me out of the car.

01:03:27.112 --> 01:03:30.413
And I remember
feeling weightless.

01:03:33.584 --> 01:03:35.852
Suddenly I was freezing.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.488
Rocks were hitting around me.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.591
Mrs. Strubing,

01:03:41.593 --> 01:03:43.926
do you see the man who raped you

01:03:43.928 --> 01:03:46.729
in this courtroom today?

01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:48.164
Yes.

01:03:50.134 --> 01:03:51.934
He's right over there.

01:03:51.936 --> 01:03:54.103
The colored man.

01:03:55.472 --> 01:03:59.509
For the record, Mrs. Strubing,
which colored man?

01:04:01.145 --> 01:04:03.012
The one in the brown suit.

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:07.183
Thank you.

01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:13.322
One more question,
Mrs. Strubing.

01:04:13.324 --> 01:04:17.894
Did you encounter anybody else
during your time with Mr. Spell?

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:20.563
Yes, as we were driving
toward the reservoir,

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.598
the car suddenly filled
with red light.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.235
It was the police.
I thought, at last, I was saved.

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:28.504
And then Joseph said
to get down back there

01:04:28.506 --> 01:04:31.641
and if I made a sound,
that he would cut my throat.

01:04:31.643 --> 01:04:34.310
Then I heard the policeman.

01:04:34.312 --> 01:04:37.013
And I thought,
please, please, just look.

01:04:37.015 --> 01:04:39.182
But he didn't.

01:04:39.184 --> 01:04:41.150
He-He spoke with Joseph
and then he left.

01:04:43.154 --> 01:04:46.389
I'm so sorry.
I did not want to cry.

01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:48.825
I'm so sorry.

01:04:48.827 --> 01:04:51.861
You've been very strong,
Mrs. Strubing.

01:04:51.863 --> 01:04:54.163
She certainly has,
Your Honor.

01:04:54.165 --> 01:04:56.098
No more questions.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.567
Hi there.

01:05:31.569 --> 01:05:34.036
Name, sir?
Sam... Friedman.

01:05:34.038 --> 01:05:36.372
Sam Friedman.
Friedman.

01:05:36.374 --> 01:05:38.407
I don't seem to have
your name here, sir.

01:05:38.409 --> 01:05:40.910
Actually, I'm a friend of...

01:05:40.912 --> 01:05:42.912
Hold onto this for me.

01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:45.481
Sir, you can't go back there.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.350
Gentlemen, you must leave now!

01:05:47.352 --> 01:05:49.886
Marshall, this is not the kind of place
you want to make a scene.

01:05:49.888 --> 01:05:51.654
I know.
I used to work in a place just like this.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.856
That's exactly
what my father said.

01:05:53.858 --> 01:05:56.492
If we just let the Reds
and the Nazis fight it out,

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.227
they'll take care
of each other beautifully.

01:05:58.229 --> 01:06:02.031
This club is
for members only, boy.

01:06:02.033 --> 01:06:06.836
Lorin, it appears that you have
some rather unique admirers.

01:06:13.711 --> 01:06:17.213
- This is a private club.
- She wasn't in the car, Lorin.

01:06:17.215 --> 01:06:19.916
- Excuse me?
- You had her lie on the stand today.

01:06:20.918 --> 01:06:22.852
Are you accusing me of a crime?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:26.022
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm doing.

01:06:28.091 --> 01:06:30.192
Who do you think you are?

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:34.297
We have a sworn statement from an Officer
McCoy that Spell was alone that night.

01:06:34.299 --> 01:06:37.733
I don't care what you have.

01:06:37.735 --> 01:06:39.869
Ellie Strubing told the Greenwich
police everything

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:42.371
when she first recounted
the crime.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:45.141
If she wasn't in the car, how could she
have known the car had been stopped, hmm?

01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:47.343
Here.

01:06:49.913 --> 01:06:52.415
Read it.
What is this?

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:54.817
Another sworn statement.

01:06:54.819 --> 01:06:58.888
This from Ellie Strubing the morning
they found her. Dated, timed, notarized.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:02.058
Everything she told
the Greenwich police.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.995
This is fraudulent.

01:07:05.997 --> 01:07:08.030
Get out of my club.

01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:20.576
I've had better.

01:07:39.963 --> 01:07:42.231
Are you okay, sweetie?

01:07:44.267 --> 01:07:45.901
You look blue.

01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:51.073
And a man as good-looking as you
has no cause to be blue.

01:08:13.864 --> 01:08:15.631
Where is he?

01:08:20.002 --> 01:08:21.437
Attorney Friedman.

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.645
I'm not much of a conversationalist
tonight.

01:08:31.747 --> 01:08:34.450
It's okay. I am.
I'm Jen.

01:08:35.484 --> 01:08:37.486
Thurgood.
Pleasure.

01:08:38.921 --> 01:08:40.923
I've never
seen you here before...

01:08:45.562 --> 01:08:47.462
Attorney Friedman.

01:08:48.665 --> 01:08:51.667
Attorney Friedman,
hold on a minute.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:53.935
What do you want?

01:08:53.938 --> 01:08:56.072
We're just eager
to introduce ourselves.

01:08:57.506 --> 01:09:00.676
To you and the nigger lawyer.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:03.746
You don't want to have anything to do
with this man, miss.

01:09:07.884 --> 01:09:09.018
Excuse me.

01:09:11.888 --> 01:09:15.524
You gentlemen
are making a big mistake.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.694
There's no mistake.
We know who you are.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.035
Bet you wish you had
your nigger lawyer friend now.

01:09:34.444 --> 01:09:36.679
Get out of here. Get out of here.
Hey!

01:09:37.747 --> 01:09:39.348
Hold him up.

01:09:40.984 --> 01:09:42.751
Let him go! Hold on.

01:09:42.752 --> 01:09:45.020
You liking this?
You kike!

01:09:45.956 --> 01:09:48.224
Let him go!
Let him go!

01:09:49.326 --> 01:09:51.026
Let him go!

01:09:55.633 --> 01:09:57.466
- Go, go!
- Kike bastard!

01:09:57.468 --> 01:09:59.034
Sam!

01:10:12.849 --> 01:10:15.217
This here
is Mr. Thurgood Marshall.

01:10:17.087 --> 01:10:20.322
This man is an attorney.

01:10:20.324 --> 01:10:24.493
You'll be showing Mr. Marshall
all the respect he deserves.

01:10:24.495 --> 01:10:25.761
Understand?

01:10:36.506 --> 01:10:37.940
Sit down
and finish your bourbon.

01:10:38.875 --> 01:10:40.576
Say something!

01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:43.412
You're late.

01:10:48.718 --> 01:10:50.920
What happened?
Huh?

01:10:53.657 --> 01:10:55.491
I didn't mean to start trouble.

01:10:55.493 --> 01:10:57.259
It's not your fault.

01:10:58.228 --> 01:10:59.962
Here.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.530
It's okay.

01:11:12.075 --> 01:11:14.643
Listen.

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:16.212
Men are men...

01:11:18.848 --> 01:11:20.950
and women are women.

01:11:21.918 --> 01:11:23.519
Right?

01:11:25.889 --> 01:11:27.423
Right.

01:11:27.425 --> 01:11:29.825
The Nazi masters of Germany...

01:11:31.228 --> 01:11:34.363
have made it clear
that they intend

01:11:34.365 --> 01:11:38.033
not only to dominate all life
and thought...

01:11:38.035 --> 01:11:40.102
in their own country,

01:11:40.104 --> 01:11:42.905
but also to enslave
the whole of Europe.

01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:45.274
There's flanken.

01:11:45.276 --> 01:11:47.109
Why are you so...

01:11:48.445 --> 01:11:51.180
My God, Sam.
What happened to you?

01:11:52.549 --> 01:11:56.185
I... I could use some ice.

01:11:58.255 --> 01:12:00.356
Hey. What is it?
What's wrong?

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:02.658
I got in the first punch.

01:12:06.696 --> 01:12:08.264
Wh-What's wrong?
What is this?

01:12:08.266 --> 01:12:10.466
You've been crying.

01:12:11.601 --> 01:12:14.203
No. Not now. Let's...

01:12:15.138 --> 01:12:16.338
Tell me.

01:12:18.975 --> 01:12:21.176
My cousin Anna, in Kraków.

01:12:23.613 --> 01:12:25.514
They took her?

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:38.060
Who is that?
I don't know.

01:12:39.296 --> 01:12:40.829
Stand back.

01:12:45.602 --> 01:12:47.069
Yeah.

01:12:56.814 --> 01:12:59.748
Who is it?
It's me.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.985
Thurgood. Your co-counsel.
Open up!

01:13:08.525 --> 01:13:10.426
What happened to you?

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:13.862
Did I come at a bad time?
What do you want, Thurgood?

01:13:13.864 --> 01:13:16.799
I have thoughts about tomorrow.

01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:18.634
Tomorrow?
Get out of my house.

01:13:18.636 --> 01:13:20.369
No.

01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:22.237
Not until I tell you
why I'm here.

01:13:35.218 --> 01:13:37.119
Hear me out.

01:13:38.855 --> 01:13:40.622
You were right.

01:13:41.858 --> 01:13:44.259
I had it all wrong all along.

01:13:45.395 --> 01:13:47.629
Spell was with her all night.

01:13:47.631 --> 01:13:49.998
Spell lied.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.667
This is your big epiphany?

01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:54.670
Eleanor Strubing lied too.

01:13:54.672 --> 01:13:56.772
Neither of them have
been telling us the truth.

01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:03.912
Thurgood, you have just
broken this case wide open.

01:14:03.914 --> 01:14:07.583
My God, you really
are a legal genius.

01:14:08.718 --> 01:14:10.786
Men are men and women are women.

01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:16.291
Men are men
and women are women, Sam.

01:14:23.767 --> 01:14:25.534
You think it was consensual.

01:14:25.536 --> 01:14:28.270
It's the only explanation
that makes sense.

01:14:30.206 --> 01:14:32.341
How can we be certain?

01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:39.615
We need to talk.
Talk about what?

01:14:39.617 --> 01:14:43.419
Listen to me carefully now.

01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:45.854
Did you have sexual intercourse
with Eleanor Strubing?

01:14:46.923 --> 01:14:49.291
No. Why you
keep asking me that?

01:14:49.293 --> 01:14:51.860
I never asked you that before.

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:54.029
Did you have sex with her?

01:14:55.231 --> 01:14:57.599
Speak, goddamn it.
I told you I didn't.

01:14:57.601 --> 01:15:00.536
She says she was in that car
when it got stopped.

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.439
You hear her say that in court?
I heard, but she's lying.

01:15:03.441 --> 01:15:06.308
No, she's not lying.

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:11.046
- You're lying.
- Why are you taking her side?

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.215
The cop...
The cop never searched the car.

01:15:14.651 --> 01:15:16.485
She was in the back seat,
wasn't she?

01:15:16.487 --> 01:15:18.821
No. Look, I'm telling you...

01:15:18.823 --> 01:15:20.556
Get this through your head.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:22.958
She gave a statement to the police
early that morning.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.693
She knew then the car
had been stopped.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.002
Okay.
Okay, she was there.

01:15:35.438 --> 01:15:37.639
And did you have sex
with her that night?

01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:39.708
Mmm.

01:15:40.844 --> 01:15:42.678
Answer me.
Answer me now!

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.213
Yes.

01:15:45.248 --> 01:15:47.049
How many times?

01:15:48.284 --> 01:15:49.852
Two times.

01:15:49.854 --> 01:15:53.155
So, you're guilty.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:54.957
- You've been lying all along.
- No!

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:56.625
It wasn't rape.

01:15:56.627 --> 01:16:00.963
What about the skin under her nails?
The doctor lying too?

01:16:00.965 --> 01:16:03.665
When we got to the reservoir,
I parked the car.

01:16:03.667 --> 01:16:06.168
But she starts screaming,
opens the door to run out.

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:08.203
So I grabbed her
just to keep her there.

01:16:08.205 --> 01:16:10.372
That's when she scratches me.

01:16:11.941 --> 01:16:14.142
- You lying to me again?
- No.

01:16:14.144 --> 01:16:15.911
It's the truth.

01:16:17.847 --> 01:16:20.148
Why didn't you tell me the truth
in the first place?

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:22.551
Because I-I was confused.

01:16:22.553 --> 01:16:24.486
That's not good enough, Joseph.

01:16:24.488 --> 01:16:27.155
Willis is gonna ask you why you lied,
sure as you're standing here.

01:16:27.157 --> 01:16:28.957
He's gonna ask you
in front of everyone.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:31.059
The jury's gonna be studying you
with all 24 eyes.

01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:33.529
And you're just gonna say you were
confused? I couldn't think straight.

01:16:33.531 --> 01:16:35.497
That's not gonna swing it.

01:16:35.499 --> 01:16:37.799
You lied in a sworn statement.

01:16:37.801 --> 01:16:40.335
Why would you do that?

01:16:40.337 --> 01:16:43.805
Because I was scared.
All right?

01:16:45.742 --> 01:16:48.777
I was scared what they'd gonna do to me
if they find out.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.981
My father told me once,

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:30.352
"If anybody calls you nigger,

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:32.588
you not only got my permission
to fight him,

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.923
you got my orders
to fight him."

01:17:37.026 --> 01:17:41.663
Your father say anything
about being called a kike?

01:17:44.267 --> 01:17:47.302
No.

01:17:47.304 --> 01:17:49.271
Not to me anyway.

01:17:53.242 --> 01:17:55.677
You look like
a real fighter now, Sam.

01:17:58.481 --> 01:18:00.515
Like a Jewish Joe Louis.

01:18:01.451 --> 01:18:03.418
Nah.

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.687
Barney Ross is my guy.

01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:09.691
Barney Ross it is.

01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:22.704
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Friedman.

01:18:23.906 --> 01:18:25.807
Mrs. Strubing,

01:18:25.809 --> 01:18:28.176
you're originally from Philadelphia,
is that correct?

01:18:28.178 --> 01:18:29.578
Yes.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.480
College grad?

01:18:31.482 --> 01:18:33.849
Bryn Mawr,
Mr. Friedman.

01:18:33.851 --> 01:18:35.984
And you were an athlete,
I understand?

01:18:35.986 --> 01:18:39.021
Yes, I was on the swim team.

01:18:39.023 --> 01:18:41.657
Ah.

01:18:41.659 --> 01:18:44.326
You and your husband moved to your estate
in Greenwich

01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:45.994
last spring, is that correct?

01:18:45.996 --> 01:18:48.030
I don't know
if I'd call it an estate.

01:18:48.032 --> 01:18:51.033
I'm sorry. A mansion?

01:18:51.035 --> 01:18:54.436
John and I moved here, to Greenwich,
rather, last May.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:56.371
Mm-hmm.

01:18:56.373 --> 01:18:59.975
But your husband was away on the night
of this incident. Is that right?

01:18:59.977 --> 01:19:02.678
Yes, as I said, on business.

01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:08.950
You've testified that you went out
on the evening in question.

01:19:08.952 --> 01:19:12.387
That is correct.
To the Moores'.

01:19:12.389 --> 01:19:15.957
Did you, um... Did you drink
at the Moores' home?

01:19:17.193 --> 01:19:19.127
As I recall, I drank some wine.

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:20.962
How many glasses, would you say?

01:19:22.665 --> 01:19:24.533
I don't remember.

01:19:24.535 --> 01:19:25.934
But it was more than one.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.572
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't remember.

01:19:31.474 --> 01:19:32.808
Mm-hmm.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:36.578
When you drove home,
were you tipsy?

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.347
I never drink enough
to get tipsy.

01:19:39.349 --> 01:19:44.553
Okay. So you went straight up to your
room to shower. Is that correct?

01:19:44.555 --> 01:19:46.321
Yes.

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.757
And when you came out
of the shower,

01:19:48.759 --> 01:19:52.928
you say Joseph
was waiting for you.

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:55.764
I didn't see him at first.

01:19:55.766 --> 01:19:58.400
I had no reason to believe
that I wasn't alone.

01:19:58.402 --> 01:19:59.835
But then...

01:20:01.537 --> 01:20:02.971
he was there.

01:20:09.545 --> 01:20:12.080
You were attracted to Joseph,
weren't you, Mrs. Strubing?

01:20:12.082 --> 01:20:14.082
- Objection! That's an absurd accusation!
- What?

01:20:14.084 --> 01:20:15.847
You invited him into
your bed, didn't you?

01:20:15.859 --> 01:20:16.451
Your Honor!

01:20:16.453 --> 01:20:19.421
He attacked me! Strike the question
and answer from the record.

01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:23.425
Mr. Friedman, no more of this.
You understand me?

01:20:23.427 --> 01:20:25.494
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

01:20:27.263 --> 01:20:31.032
Now, your bedroom is just below the room
where the maid slept?

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.567
Yes.

01:20:32.569 --> 01:20:35.070
Did you scream for help?

01:20:35.072 --> 01:20:37.072
I couldn't.
He had a knife.

01:20:37.074 --> 01:20:39.775
Did he hold the knife
as he removed his clothing?

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.477
He must have.

01:20:42.479 --> 01:20:46.848
So he removed his pants, belt,
zipper, whatever, with one hand?

01:20:48.451 --> 01:20:49.985
Apparently so.

01:20:51.053 --> 01:20:52.754
You told Mr. Willis

01:20:52.756 --> 01:20:54.756
that you fought him,
but he overpowered you.

01:20:54.758 --> 01:20:57.092
- Is that right?
- Yes.

01:20:57.094 --> 01:21:00.729
There was a phone
right next to your bed.

01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:04.332
- Did you attempt to use it?
- No. I was terrified.

01:21:04.334 --> 01:21:08.670
Afraid to use the phone or scream for help,
but not afraid to fight back?

01:21:08.672 --> 01:21:11.373
You have no idea what it feels like
to be so afraid.

01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:14.976
But at no point...
at no point

01:21:14.978 --> 01:21:17.746
during the hours and hours
that the two of you were together

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:21.683
did you ever attempt to make any calls,
to escape, to raise your voice for help?

01:21:21.685 --> 01:21:24.686
- Object. This is argument.
- I was scared for my life!

01:21:24.688 --> 01:21:26.788
Sustained.
The jury will disregard the question.

01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:29.090
You knew you had been unfaithful
to your husband.

01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:31.459
You were terrified of what he would do
to you if he found out.

01:21:31.461 --> 01:21:33.528
And you wanted to get away.
He is badgering the witness!

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:36.631
That is not true! I was forced
to leave the house. He bound me!

01:21:36.633 --> 01:21:39.267
He gagged me
and he dragged me to the car.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.603
The police stopped the car?

01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:43.972
Yes.
But still you did not scream?

01:21:43.974 --> 01:21:48.476
- He had a knife!
- Right. Right. The knife.

01:21:48.478 --> 01:21:52.113
As you testified, you were afraid that
he was gonna slash your throat

01:21:52.115 --> 01:21:54.482
from the front seat
of the car, was it?

01:21:54.484 --> 01:21:56.618
I couldn't make a sound.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.855
- Because of the gag?
- Yes.

01:22:01.057 --> 01:22:03.692
Mrs. Strubing,

01:22:03.694 --> 01:22:06.394
this Exhibit "I" is identical to the gag
that he used?

01:22:06.396 --> 01:22:08.630
Yes.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:11.199
Let's just show the jury
what he did then.

01:22:11.201 --> 01:22:16.872
Mrs. Strubing, please, please instruct
Mr. Marshall, if you would.

01:22:20.042 --> 01:22:23.144
The gag was between your lips.
Is that correct, Mrs. Strubing?

01:22:23.146 --> 01:22:25.280
Yes. That's correct.

01:22:33.723 --> 01:22:37.158
Is this about right?

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.562
No, it was a bit tighter than that.

01:22:43.933 --> 01:22:45.934
How 'bout this, ma'am?

01:22:45.936 --> 01:22:47.469
Yes, that's about it.

01:23:00.416 --> 01:23:03.818
Now, you could have
done that, Mrs. Strubing.

01:23:05.054 --> 01:23:06.788
He would have killed me.

01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:10.392
- Who would have killed you? Your husband?
- Objection!

01:23:10.394 --> 01:23:12.560
- Quiet, Mr. Marshall.
- How dare you speak to me that way.

01:23:12.562 --> 01:23:14.501
There was a policeman
standing not three feet

01:23:14.513 --> 01:23:16.464
away from you. You did
not call out for help.

01:23:16.466 --> 01:23:18.149
Instead, Joseph drove
on to the reservoir.

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:19.367
I'm warning you. No speaking!

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:22.237
You bolted from the car because
you were ashamed of what you had done

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:24.439
- with another man, with a colored man!
- Objection!

01:23:24.441 --> 01:23:28.043
One more word out of you and
I will hold you in contempt!

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:31.046
You were afraid of what your husband
would do to you if he found out.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.214
Afraid that you were pregnant
with a colored child.

01:23:33.216 --> 01:23:35.317
- Objection! This is argument!
- Sustained.

01:23:35.319 --> 01:23:38.286
- Jury will disregard.
- You jumped into that water.

01:23:38.288 --> 01:23:40.822
- You wanted to end it all.
- Jumped? I was thrown.

01:23:40.824 --> 01:23:44.926
I was thrown. My hands were tied.
He tried to kill me!

01:23:44.928 --> 01:23:49.731
Your hands were not tied,
Mrs. Strubing.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:52.300
You were able
to remove your coat

01:23:52.302 --> 01:23:55.136
and let it float in the water
as you swam to shore.

01:23:55.138 --> 01:23:59.107
That's not true. That's a lie.
He gagged me. He tied me.

01:23:59.109 --> 01:24:00.375
Raped me.

01:24:04.513 --> 01:24:10.051
I am so... so sorry for your unhappiness,
Mrs. Strubing.

01:24:12.588 --> 01:24:13.989
No more questions.

01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:18.727
- Mr. Willis?
- I have no questions.

01:24:27.803 --> 01:24:30.538
How can we put Spell on the stand
with all this baggage?

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.707
The jury needs
to hear him deny it.

01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:35.143
And you bring out
all the bad stuff yourself.

01:24:35.145 --> 01:24:37.512
Don't leave anything for Willis.

01:24:37.514 --> 01:24:39.814
What happens to the organization
if we lose?

01:24:39.816 --> 01:24:41.950
I don't even want
to think about it.

01:24:43.853 --> 01:24:46.354
You could blame me.

01:24:46.356 --> 01:24:48.390
You're one of us now, Sam.

01:24:48.392 --> 01:24:50.792
Haven't you noticed?

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:55.296
In the papers they write, "Sam Friedman
and Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP."

01:25:01.337 --> 01:25:04.272
Joseph, please tell the jury
where you were raised.

01:25:05.341 --> 01:25:06.775
Louisiana.

01:25:08.677 --> 01:25:12.580
- You have a wife and two children, right?
- Uh-huh.

01:25:12.582 --> 01:25:16.651
Even though you have a wife, you have
another woman in White Plains, is it?

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:18.353
Yes.
What's he doing?

01:25:18.355 --> 01:25:20.688
- Ever served in the army, Joseph?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:23.758
Fort Benning, Georgia,
six years. Discharged.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.428
That was
a dishonorable discharge?

01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:28.329
Yes.

01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:31.199
Then you moved north?
That's right.

01:25:31.201 --> 01:25:34.702
Before working for the Strubings,
you worked for another family in Greenwich?

01:25:34.704 --> 01:25:35.904
Yes, sir.

01:25:35.906 --> 01:25:38.039
They accused you of stealing
and fired you.

01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:39.874
Yes, sir.

01:25:39.876 --> 01:25:41.609
And when you worked
for the Strubings,

01:25:41.611 --> 01:25:43.912
did you run into
any other difficulties?

01:25:43.914 --> 01:25:47.749
- No, sir.
- Did the Strubings treat you well, Joseph?

01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:50.118
She was always real nice to me.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.420
What about Mr. Strubing?

01:25:58.094 --> 01:25:59.494
Was he mean to you?

01:26:00.529 --> 01:26:02.564
He was mean to everybody.

01:26:02.566 --> 01:26:04.999
It is what you did.
Don't lie to me.

01:26:07.536 --> 01:26:10.205
- Watch where you're standing.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.349
Just a second, Joseph.
I'm sorry.

01:26:22.985 --> 01:26:24.853
That's quite all right, ma'am.

01:26:29.492 --> 01:26:32.260
On the night of this incident,

01:26:32.262 --> 01:26:34.796
why did you go into
Mrs. Strubing's room?

01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:38.733
To ask her for money. I had to pay
a man I'd been playing cards with.

01:26:40.002 --> 01:26:41.669
What happened
when you got to the room?

01:26:50.479 --> 01:26:52.714
I knocked on the door.

01:26:53.816 --> 01:26:55.650
Come in.

01:26:55.652 --> 01:26:58.820
I could tell she'd been sad.
She was crying.

01:26:58.822 --> 01:27:01.589
- Are you okay, ma'am?
- What do you want, Joseph?

01:27:02.925 --> 01:27:04.993
It can wait, Mrs. Strubing.

01:27:04.995 --> 01:27:07.162
But she told me to stay,
ask my question.

01:27:07.164 --> 01:27:09.764
I told her I needed some money.
She asked what for.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.734
There's a man I owe.

01:27:13.836 --> 01:27:15.570
Ah.

01:27:23.312 --> 01:27:25.613
So she went to the bureau.

01:27:28.551 --> 01:27:31.719
She said, "Is this enough for you, Joseph?"
I said, "Yes, ma'am. Thank you."

01:27:31.721 --> 01:27:33.888
But she didn't give it to me.
Then she asked me...

01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:37.959
I'm not awful like him,
am I, Joseph?

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:39.961
No, ma'am.

01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:51.339
Joseph.

01:27:51.341 --> 01:27:53.942
She asked me not to
leave her alone that night.

01:27:54.877 --> 01:27:58.112
And, uh... I didn't.

01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:23.371
Then what happened?

01:28:23.373 --> 01:28:25.773
Well, we went down to the living room,
me and her.

01:28:25.775 --> 01:28:28.910
- We had a drink together.
- What did the two of you talk about?

01:28:30.546 --> 01:28:32.313
She told me he beats her.

01:28:33.115 --> 01:28:34.582
Who beats her?

01:28:41.857 --> 01:28:43.791
Who did that?

01:28:46.862 --> 01:28:48.329
My husband.

01:29:13.622 --> 01:29:16.057
Did she ever resist you, Joseph?

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:19.027
No, she didn't.
Not at all.

01:29:21.563 --> 01:29:23.598
What happened next?

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.035
We were lying on the sofa.

01:29:39.348 --> 01:29:41.983
Oh, God.

01:29:41.985 --> 01:29:45.353
- And she heard some dogs barking.
- Joseph.

01:29:45.355 --> 01:29:48.656
She was convinced somebody was gonna
come to the house and find us together.

01:29:48.658 --> 01:29:51.225
Get up. Get up!

01:29:52.428 --> 01:29:54.595
Nobody gonna wake up.

01:29:54.597 --> 01:29:57.999
She started panicking. I told her
there's no one coming. Everything's fine.

01:29:58.001 --> 01:30:00.802
But she was insisting on,
"We gotta get out of here.

01:30:00.804 --> 01:30:04.305
We gotta get out of here right now."
So we left the house.

01:30:04.307 --> 01:30:08.276
We go down to the car,
and we drive around for a bit.

01:30:08.278 --> 01:30:11.946
She sat in the back,
so it don't look wrong.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:14.916
Then the cop car
come up from behind.

01:30:16.385 --> 01:30:18.152
She get real scared.

01:30:18.154 --> 01:30:20.154
She say...
Why don't you lie down and keep quiet?

01:30:20.156 --> 01:30:21.789
I can't be seen
with a colored man.

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:24.225
I say, "You lie down
and keep quiet then."

01:30:24.227 --> 01:30:26.461
Don't move. Shh. Shh.

01:30:27.663 --> 01:30:29.297
Oh.
Shh, shh.

01:30:33.869 --> 01:30:36.337
Where'd you get this car, boy?

01:30:36.339 --> 01:30:39.774
I'm a chauffeur, sir. Belongs to John
Strubing. Greenwich, Connecticut.

01:30:42.077 --> 01:30:43.945
Identification.
Yes, sir.

01:30:53.155 --> 01:30:54.989
Drive slower, boy.
Yes, sir.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.924
Get your ass
out of Port Chester.

01:30:56.926 --> 01:30:58.493
On my way right now, sir.
Thank you.

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:00.194
What happened next?

01:31:00.196 --> 01:31:04.132
We get to the reservoir,
and, uh, she scream at me.

01:31:05.267 --> 01:31:06.868
Joseph, stop the car.
Stop the car!

01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:09.036
Joseph, stop the car!

01:31:09.038 --> 01:31:11.105
What's the matter?

01:31:11.107 --> 01:31:13.508
She keeps shaking her head
and saying, "What have I done?"

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:15.710
Everything's gonna be fine,
Mrs. Strubing.

01:31:15.712 --> 01:31:18.012
Just take a deep breath,
okay? No, no, no, no.

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:21.048
No, you don't understand.

01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:24.452
Maybe we should just
go back to the house, huh?

01:31:24.454 --> 01:31:27.755
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

01:31:27.757 --> 01:31:31.759
She keeps saying, "I'm gonna get pregnant."
"No, you ain't," I said.

01:31:31.761 --> 01:31:34.395
- You're not gonna get pregnant.
- I can't have a colored child.

01:31:34.397 --> 01:31:36.798
You're not gonna have
no babies at all, okay?

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.767
I say,
"Just let me take you home."

01:31:40.736 --> 01:31:42.069
And she screamed at me.

01:31:42.071 --> 01:31:43.905
Let me out of the car!

01:31:43.907 --> 01:31:45.640
I'm gonna tell everybody
you raped me!

01:31:46.909 --> 01:31:48.576
She go to open the door,
and I grabbed her.

01:31:48.578 --> 01:31:50.711
Let me go!
Just to keep her there.

01:31:50.713 --> 01:31:53.915
That's when she scratches my arm.
Mrs. Strubing.

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:55.716
Hey. Hey!

01:31:57.052 --> 01:31:59.253
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:31:59.255 --> 01:32:02.223
Mrs. Strubing,
what you doing up there?

01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:04.258
I yell at her
to come back, but...

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.061
Come on down right now.
Let's get in the car and go home.

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:08.763
She just turned away.

01:32:08.765 --> 01:32:10.531
Mrs. Strub...

01:32:25.814 --> 01:32:30.384
Joseph, did you rape
Mrs. Strubing?

01:32:32.254 --> 01:32:35.823
No. I did not.

01:32:36.992 --> 01:32:38.926
Thank you, Joseph.

01:32:41.797 --> 01:32:43.231
Your witness.

01:32:46.602 --> 01:32:48.436
Not bad.

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:51.105
You wouldn't lie to the jury, would
you, Joseph? Not bad at all.

01:32:51.107 --> 01:32:52.773
No, sir, I wouldn't.

01:32:52.775 --> 01:32:54.675
But the fact is,
you are a liar, aren't you?

01:32:54.677 --> 01:32:56.611
Objection!
Argumentative.

01:32:56.613 --> 01:33:00.114
Overruled.
It's cross-examination.

01:33:01.717 --> 01:33:03.150
He's okay.

01:33:03.152 --> 01:33:06.187
When you married
your first wife, Hattie,

01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:09.490
you swore to God you'd be faithful to her,
did you not?

01:33:09.492 --> 01:33:13.427
- Yes, sir.
- But you weren't. It was a lie.

01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:16.631
You could say.

01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:19.300
You told her you'd take care
of your children, didn't you?

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:22.103
Yes, sir.
But you haven't, have you?

01:33:23.405 --> 01:33:25.806
Not so much as I should.

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:29.644
Then you were in the service
and you swore to honor your country.

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:31.679
But that was a lie too.
No.

01:33:31.681 --> 01:33:36.317
Then you came north and you stole from
your first employer?

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.112
When the police picked
you up, you lied to

01:33:38.124 --> 01:33:40.054
them about your whereabouts
the night before.

01:33:40.056 --> 01:33:42.723
- Didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

01:33:42.725 --> 01:33:46.394
You gave a statement under oath
that you were in a bar all night.

01:33:46.396 --> 01:33:48.396
Yes.

01:33:48.398 --> 01:33:51.232
So you lied to your wife,
you lied to the State of Louisiana,

01:33:51.234 --> 01:33:53.768
you lied to the police,
you lied to God.

01:33:53.770 --> 01:33:56.037
Why should anyone
believe you now?

01:33:56.039 --> 01:33:59.740
I don't know why they should,
except it's the truth.

01:33:59.742 --> 01:34:05.446
The truth? If it's the truth,
why not tell it from the beginning?

01:34:05.448 --> 01:34:08.683
If you're an innocent man,
why lie?

01:34:10.919 --> 01:34:13.688
Why lie, Mr. Spell? Answer the question.
Tell him, Joseph.

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:18.426
If you were an innocent man,
why would you lie?

01:34:18.428 --> 01:34:21.896
I tell the police I was with her,
it was what she wanted?

01:34:21.898 --> 01:34:24.031
If it's the truth.

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:28.202
In Louisiana, you know what they do to me
for being with a white woman like that?

01:34:28.204 --> 01:34:31.072
If they don't kill me
right then and there,

01:34:31.074 --> 01:34:35.142
soon enough the others come,
they drag me off, they tie me up,

01:34:35.144 --> 01:34:37.178
they cut off my manhood.

01:34:39.481 --> 01:34:42.216
And then I'd be swingin'
off the branch of some tree.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:46.287
So... why'd I lie,
Mr. Willis?

01:34:47.656 --> 01:34:50.057
Because the truth
gets me killed.

01:34:50.059 --> 01:34:52.026
That's why.

01:34:52.995 --> 01:34:54.528
I move the answer be stricken.

01:35:10.313 --> 01:35:12.213
The answer will stand.

01:35:19.788 --> 01:35:21.389
Mr. Willis?

01:35:24.626 --> 01:35:26.661
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:35:41.044 --> 01:35:43.010
You know what?

01:35:43.012 --> 01:35:45.780
It finally looks like a respectable
law office in here.

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:50.284
Come in.

01:35:52.054 --> 01:35:54.455
There's someone here
to see you, Mr. Marshall.

01:35:56.992 --> 01:35:58.426
Walter?

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:03.030
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?

01:36:04.366 --> 01:36:07.702
I'll just move
to Irwin's office.

01:36:11.574 --> 01:36:13.407
Come on, Walter.

01:36:13.409 --> 01:36:15.242
What is this?

01:36:15.244 --> 01:36:18.179
Fourteen-year-old boy in Mississippi.
They say he killed a cop.

01:36:18.181 --> 01:36:21.015
He needs a lawyer.

01:36:21.017 --> 01:36:24.018
- And I have to leave tonight?
- Uh-huh.

01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.187
He ready with the summation?

01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:29.023
Sam? He will be.

01:36:29.025 --> 01:36:32.293
Then there's no reason for you to stay.
I'll take care of everything.

01:36:47.175 --> 01:36:48.743
You get the picture
Renie left you?

01:36:49.344 --> 01:36:51.245
Ah, yes.

01:36:51.247 --> 01:36:54.982
Now, what kind of plane is this?

01:36:56.084 --> 01:37:00.020
She said
it's supposed to be you.

01:37:00.022 --> 01:37:02.289
Those are ears, not wings.
Ah!

01:37:03.759 --> 01:37:05.659
She's quite a talent.

01:37:07.796 --> 01:37:09.563
You were right, you know.

01:37:09.565 --> 01:37:12.933
About what?
"Why would she lie?"

01:37:12.935 --> 01:37:14.602
Mmm.

01:37:14.604 --> 01:37:16.670
That is the question
we needed to answer.

01:37:17.873 --> 01:37:19.340
Well...

01:37:21.143 --> 01:37:26.514
I'm thankful Renie got to see there's men
like you in the world.

01:37:30.318 --> 01:37:33.287
I don't understand how you can leave
before closing arguments.

01:37:33.289 --> 01:37:37.158
Doesn't do anyone any good having me
sit around waiting on a verdict.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.260
What if something comes up?

01:37:39.262 --> 01:37:41.929
The case is in, Sam.

01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:44.932
Walter will represent the NAACP.

01:37:44.934 --> 01:37:46.400
And you'll be there for Spell.

01:37:53.742 --> 01:37:56.777
Sam, did you know
I only have one testicle?

01:37:56.779 --> 01:37:59.814
Um... no.

01:37:59.816 --> 01:38:01.749
Yeah.

01:38:01.751 --> 01:38:06.120
In my college years, I found myself running
from a gang of bigots

01:38:06.122 --> 01:38:09.657
in a part of town they didn't believe
I should be in.

01:38:09.659 --> 01:38:11.859
My buddies, they're ahead of me
in a truck.

01:38:11.861 --> 01:38:14.161
I jump for the back,
and I'm pulling myself up,

01:38:14.163 --> 01:38:18.499
but there's a jagged spike
of metal I don't see.

01:38:18.501 --> 01:38:21.602
It slashes
right through my sack.

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:23.103
Yeah.

01:38:24.472 --> 01:38:26.774
Why am I telling you this?

01:38:26.776 --> 01:38:29.944
Well, I want you to know

01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:32.112
that even sitting
in the back of that pickup,

01:38:32.114 --> 01:38:33.948
my scrotum torn,

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:36.984
every bump sending shocks
of pain down my leg,

01:38:36.986 --> 01:38:40.054
even that wasn't as excruciating
as sitting there

01:38:40.056 --> 01:38:43.157
watching you argue this case
these past few weeks.

01:38:49.665 --> 01:38:52.132
- But I did learn something.
- Huh?

01:38:53.668 --> 01:38:57.471
I need an army of lawyers
just like you, Sam.

01:38:57.473 --> 01:39:01.041
Lawyers who don't even know
they want to make a difference,

01:39:01.043 --> 01:39:04.745
who with just a little bit of training
can be just as capable as me.

01:39:08.016 --> 01:39:10.951
Well, almost as capable.

01:39:13.688 --> 01:39:16.023
And until then what?

01:39:16.025 --> 01:39:20.094
You just travel around the country
on this crusade?

01:39:20.096 --> 01:39:23.364
Putting out fires
in Mississippi,

01:39:23.366 --> 01:39:26.934
Oklahoma, Bridgeport?

01:39:26.936 --> 01:39:30.170
It's not really fires
I'm after, Sam.

01:39:31.907 --> 01:39:33.674
It's fire itself.

01:39:36.945 --> 01:39:38.646
Get out your pen now.

01:39:40.715 --> 01:39:43.751
Here's the closing argument
you're gonna give.

01:39:43.753 --> 01:39:46.053
Who is telling the truth?

01:39:46.055 --> 01:39:50.858
A woman from a fine family
with an unblemished background,

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:53.193
or a depraved man,

01:39:53.195 --> 01:39:55.596
a repeat criminal
with no morals,

01:39:55.598 --> 01:39:59.934
a man whose whole life has been composed
of a series of lies?

01:40:01.569 --> 01:40:05.072
Did this decent, church-going,
intelligent woman,

01:40:05.074 --> 01:40:06.907
the graduate of a top college,

01:40:06.909 --> 01:40:10.945
engage in voluntary sexual relations
with her Negro servant

01:40:10.947 --> 01:40:13.247
and then jump
into the water, for what?

01:40:13.249 --> 01:40:16.650
For pleasure,
as the defense would have you believe?

01:40:16.652 --> 01:40:19.053
Of course not.

01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:22.723
Joseph Spell raped
Eleanor Strubing.

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:26.293
Then he hurled her over the bridge to kill
the only witness to his crime.

01:40:26.295 --> 01:40:30.664
Acquit him, and you will set
a wild panther loose in our midst

01:40:30.666 --> 01:40:32.633
to stalk more victims,

01:40:32.635 --> 01:40:34.835
to threaten the safety
and security

01:40:34.837 --> 01:40:37.638
of each and every woman
in the State of Connecticut.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.075
As a jury, you have been exposed

01:40:41.077 --> 01:40:44.311
to the darkness
of a sinister man's soul.

01:40:47.082 --> 01:40:50.451
But you're also in a position
of great privilege.

01:40:50.453 --> 01:40:53.020
Because you...

01:40:53.022 --> 01:40:55.656
you have the power

01:40:55.658 --> 01:40:59.226
to do justice
on behalf of all of us.

01:41:00.662 --> 01:41:02.563
Bullshit.
Thank you.

01:41:03.465 --> 01:41:05.399
And God bless.

01:41:13.141 --> 01:41:14.742
Mr. Friedman.

01:41:17.545 --> 01:41:21.849
Why would a woman
like Eleanor Strubing

01:41:21.851 --> 01:41:26.720
consent... no, encourage...
sexual relations

01:41:26.722 --> 01:41:29.023
with a man like Joseph Spell?

01:41:29.025 --> 01:41:31.358
Let me tell you why.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.397
Eleanor Strubing's story
is nothing less than tragic.

01:41:36.399 --> 01:41:39.333
She is a respectable woman
from a fine family.

01:41:39.335 --> 01:41:41.035
She attended the best schools.

01:41:41.037 --> 01:41:44.638
She went to church
each and every Sunday.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.242
As the good book says, she was "spotless
as the lamb of God."

01:41:48.244 --> 01:41:52.079
She was "spotless
as the lamb of God."

01:41:52.081 --> 01:41:54.848
She and her husband John
move to Greenwich.

01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:56.917
Oh, he travels frequently,

01:41:56.919 --> 01:42:00.054
leaving her alone in a new town,

01:42:00.056 --> 01:42:01.922
away from her friends
and family,

01:42:02.757 --> 01:42:04.925
in a vast, empty house.

01:42:04.927 --> 01:42:08.195
The pangs of loneliness
hit hard.

01:42:08.197 --> 01:42:10.631
She has some drinks.

01:42:11.566 --> 01:42:12.966
A knock at the door.

01:42:14.569 --> 01:42:16.837
- Joseph.
- Joseph.

01:42:16.839 --> 01:42:20.174
She was not expecting this.

01:42:20.176 --> 01:42:23.043
A young man, a handsome man.

01:42:23.045 --> 01:42:26.580
In a moment of weakness,
her judgment impaired

01:42:26.582 --> 01:42:28.248
by the alcohol
of the evening...

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:30.617
Consumed by loneliness,

01:42:30.619 --> 01:42:34.354
she invites him to share her bed
to ease her pain.

01:42:34.356 --> 01:42:37.591
As the evening goes on,
she becomes panicked

01:42:37.593 --> 01:42:39.460
that they will be discovered.

01:42:39.462 --> 01:42:43.097
She must leave the house,
must escape her sin.

01:42:44.532 --> 01:42:47.034
- What if she is pregnant...
- And with a colored child?

01:42:47.036 --> 01:42:50.604
What if her husband were to find out?
What would he do to her?

01:42:50.606 --> 01:42:54.408
She cannot live
with the fear, the shame.

01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:57.911
So then there they are,
at the reservoir.

01:42:57.913 --> 01:43:02.716
An opportunity to escape
her life, her despair.

01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:06.253
Joseph tries to hold her back,
but she wrangles free, runs from the car.

01:43:06.255 --> 01:43:10.257
And she plummets into the water.

01:43:10.259 --> 01:43:13.727
Only as soon
as she hits the surface,

01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:16.163
her years of training take over.

01:43:16.165 --> 01:43:18.632
See, she is a swimmer.

01:43:18.634 --> 01:43:21.602
And she simply cannot drown.

01:43:21.604 --> 01:43:24.104
With the zeal
to end her life gone,

01:43:24.106 --> 01:43:26.273
her only escape...

01:43:26.275 --> 01:43:27.841
She must accuse him.

01:43:27.843 --> 01:43:30.410
And so a story is created.

01:43:30.412 --> 01:43:31.745
A web of...

01:43:34.015 --> 01:43:36.283
desperate lies

01:43:36.285 --> 01:43:41.822
filled with inconsistencies,
absurdities,

01:43:42.657 --> 01:43:44.458
reasonable doubts.

01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.995
The State must prove its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

01:43:47.997 --> 01:43:50.364
It must be a clear case.

01:43:50.366 --> 01:43:54.234
No scream for help
all night long.

01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.970
Doubt.

01:43:56.972 --> 01:44:00.107
No call on
the four family phones.

01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:02.209
Doubt.

01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:05.112
No cry to the officer
just a few feet away.

01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:06.480
Doubt.

01:44:06.482 --> 01:44:09.316
No rocks on a bridge.

01:44:09.318 --> 01:44:10.517
Doubt.

01:44:10.519 --> 01:44:13.520
Doubt, doubt, doubt.

01:44:15.223 --> 01:44:17.824
The doubt, my friends,

01:44:17.826 --> 01:44:19.560
is overwhelming.

01:44:19.562 --> 01:44:24.631
This is why you must find
Joseph Spell not guilty.

01:44:24.633 --> 01:44:27.067
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:44:27.069 --> 01:44:29.536
you've heard the arguments
of counsel.

01:44:29.538 --> 01:44:33.273
You may now retire to the jury room
to begin your deliberations.

01:44:34.342 --> 01:44:35.776
Court is in recess.

01:44:47.155 --> 01:44:49.356
Who is it?

01:44:49.358 --> 01:44:50.891
It's me.

01:44:56.698 --> 01:44:58.165
Mmm!

01:45:01.336 --> 01:45:03.370
You're supposed
to be on a train.

01:45:03.372 --> 01:45:05.472
I have a little time.

01:45:12.513 --> 01:45:14.848
I heard you were looking for me.

01:45:16.384 --> 01:45:19.186
Well, Friedman, it seems you have
beginner's luck.

01:45:19.188 --> 01:45:21.622
John Strubing just called me.

01:45:21.624 --> 01:45:24.691
This whole thing has been a terrible
strain on Ellie, as you can imagine.

01:45:24.693 --> 01:45:27.194
They want it over, now.

01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:29.763
I'm prepared to offer
one final deal.

01:45:29.765 --> 01:45:32.299
What is it?
Five years.

01:45:32.301 --> 01:45:35.936
He'll have to enter a guilty plea right
away and admit he lied on the stand.

01:45:37.972 --> 01:45:40.374
I'll speak with him.
Do it now.

01:45:40.376 --> 01:45:42.843
If the jury comes back in,
the deal is off.

01:45:47.782 --> 01:45:51.451
You'd be out after three years,
with good behavior.

01:45:51.453 --> 01:45:55.322
Possibly sooner.
You think I should take it?

01:45:55.324 --> 01:45:57.324
I don't know
what the jury will do.

01:45:57.326 --> 01:46:00.227
It's a good deal.

01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:02.763
And if they convict me?

01:46:02.765 --> 01:46:05.632
Most likely you'll spend the rest
of your life in a prison cell.

01:46:07.902 --> 01:46:10.037
And I got to decide right away?

01:46:12.307 --> 01:46:14.207
What I gotta do for the deal?

01:46:17.111 --> 01:46:20.414
Admit that you raped her and that you lied
on the witness stand.

01:46:22.016 --> 01:46:24.284
Can I talk
to Mr. Marshall?

01:46:24.286 --> 01:46:27.487
He's on a train probably somewhere
in Tennessee by now.

01:46:27.489 --> 01:46:29.723
I would never be able
to reach him in time.

01:46:31.492 --> 01:46:33.393
What do you think he would say?

01:46:43.005 --> 01:46:44.538
Ah.

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:51.345
So, give me good news.

01:46:52.447 --> 01:46:54.247
No deal.

01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:58.051
You did advise him
to accept, hmm?

01:46:58.053 --> 01:47:00.687
I told him it was a good offer.

01:47:00.689 --> 01:47:02.622
I told him
what the alternative is.

01:47:02.624 --> 01:47:05.792
I told him if it was me,
I would take it.

01:47:07.995 --> 01:47:12.265
And I told him that no man should ever
confess to a crime he did not commit.

01:47:16.137 --> 01:47:19.239
I thought Jews were supposed
to be smart.

01:47:19.241 --> 01:47:21.241
But you sound
just like the Negro.

01:47:24.078 --> 01:47:26.713
Why, thank you, Lorin.

01:47:26.715 --> 01:47:29.616
That's possibly the greatest compliment
you could've given me.

01:47:56.377 --> 01:47:58.145
There's a verdict.

01:48:09.023 --> 01:48:10.457
Will the foreman
please rise.

01:48:10.459 --> 01:48:13.160
I'm the forewoman, Your Honor.

01:48:14.896 --> 01:48:16.630
Very well.

01:48:16.632 --> 01:48:18.465
Have you reached a verdict?

01:48:18.467 --> 01:48:20.033
We have, Your Honor.

01:48:21.202 --> 01:48:23.470
Mr. Spell.

01:48:23.472 --> 01:48:26.306
Rise and face the jury.
It's time.

01:48:31.379 --> 01:48:33.346
Madame Forewoman,
what is your verdict?

01:48:35.383 --> 01:48:38.318
We, the jury, find,
on the charge of rape,

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.420
that the defendant,
Joseph Spell,

01:48:40.422 --> 01:48:42.122
is not guilty.

01:48:55.003 --> 01:48:56.536
Order.

01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.675
Is this your verdict,
so say you all?

01:49:01.677 --> 01:49:03.777
We do, Your Honor.

01:49:03.779 --> 01:49:05.278
That's it, Joseph.

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.913
We did it.

01:49:06.915 --> 01:49:10.350
Mr. Spell, the jury
has found you not guilty.

01:49:10.352 --> 01:49:11.718
You are released from custody.

01:49:12.954 --> 01:49:15.755
Jury is dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

01:49:15.757 --> 01:49:18.158
All rise.

01:49:37.144 --> 01:49:39.446
- Congratulations, Mr. White.
- Thank you.

01:49:43.818 --> 01:49:46.520
Mr. Spell.

01:49:46.522 --> 01:49:48.855
Hi.
I'm Tad Lancaster.

01:49:48.857 --> 01:49:52.192
Mr. Marshall thought you might need a place
to sleep tonight.

01:49:52.194 --> 01:49:53.927
Oh, Mr. Marshall.

01:50:05.706 --> 01:50:07.107
Hello?
Hello.

01:50:08.409 --> 01:50:10.510
Sam.

01:50:10.512 --> 01:50:13.046
Sam, I can barely hear you.

01:50:13.048 --> 01:50:16.917
- Is there a verdict yet?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

01:50:16.919 --> 01:50:18.852
Sam, are you there?
Yeah.
