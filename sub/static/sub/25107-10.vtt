- Who is this guy?
- I don't know... inside...

00:25.775 --> 00:27.610
but I don't like
the looks of him... outside...

00:27.694 --> 00:29.738
He's a friend, just saying hi.
What do I do?

00:29.821 --> 00:31.448
Okay, no funny business. Inside...

00:31.531 --> 00:33.324
- Yeah, don't be a hero.
- Outside...

00:33.408 --> 00:37.078
- Do I say hi? What do I do?
- All right, acting natural and stopping

00:37.162 --> 00:39.456

00:40.248 --> 00:41.666
Hello.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.377
Ah. Hurt your hand?

00:45.128 --> 00:46.171
Tell him to off.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah, to F off,
twinkle toes. Tell him to F off.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.469
Let me handle this. Call the police. Ow!

00:52.552 --> 00:55.263
My son is coming in from Ojai
next Tuesday.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.015
- Ah.
- Leading with the inside.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.726
- Three, two, one.
- Goodbye.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.605
- Call the police.
- Inside, outside, inside, outside...

01:03.688 --> 01:05.899
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

01:05.982 --> 01:07.984

01:26.419 --> 01:27.921
<i>in seeing his business...</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:30.048
Which reminds me, I'm dying to see it.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.967
<i>- ...he was desperate for a way out.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Why don't you just tell Rebel</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:35.053
- she can't see the company?
- Then she's gonna know

01:35.136 --> 01:37.430
I'm not a tech entrepreneur
named George Maharis.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.225
<i>Fortunately,</i>
<i>his uncle inspired a solution.</i>

01:40.308 --> 01:42.310
- They're paid protestors, boy!
<i>- Unfortunately...</i>

01:42.393 --> 01:44.771
Do you think they could be Anonymous,
like Guy Fawkses?

01:44.854 --> 01:46.856
<i>...Gob had a different interpretation</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:50.151
<i>- of what a Guy Fawkes was.</i>
- Foxy guys.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.112
<i>And when he found</i>
<i>his deception falling apart,</i>

01:52.195 --> 01:54.489
<i>George Michael was in
for a pleasant surprise.</i>

01:54.572 --> 01:56.616
Fakeblock's incredible. Fakeblock is...

01:56.699 --> 01:59.828
- Yeah, Fakeblock is real. Yeah.
<i>- </i><i>And so, he went to thank a cousin</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:03.123
<i>- who was in the middle of a deception.</i>
<i>- I was this close</i>

02:03.206 --> 02:05.041
to telling Rebel the whole truth:
that you fired everyone

02:05.125 --> 02:06.501
months ago, and the thing is a fraud.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.961
Then we open the doors,
and the place is abuzz.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.256
She totally bought it.
She wants to invest now.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.258
I don't know how you did it,
but it was great.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.634
You got people there for the day.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.678
I didn't hire anybody for the day.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.807
Then where did those people come from?
The place was wall-to-wall nerds.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.308
Yeah, this is making sense.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.854
Those people that you saw didn't come in
for the day.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.397
They never left.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.024
Remember when I said I fired everybody?

02:30.191 --> 02:34.904
What I did was, I asked Joan
in HR to fire everybody for me.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.656
Then, so I didn't have to make
two phone calls,

02:36.739 --> 02:38.074
I fired her there on the spot.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.202
- So you fired the person in charge of...
- Firing.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.956
Yes. So, you know,
you fire the person in HR last.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.166
That's the lesson here.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.251
But, hey, this is how you learn
in business, am I right?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.253
We're still somehow paying these people?

02:50.336 --> 02:53.298
Well, we're not paying Joan in HR.
Gotta give me credit for that one.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.466
Well, we're not gonna have
any more credit at all.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.760
That explains why Maeby's
credit cards aren't working.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.137
Maeby's credit cards?

03:00.680 --> 03:03.641
Oh, sorry. The minute I put the teeth in,
I become...

03:03.725 --> 03:05.727
a completely different person.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.896
Speaking of which, there's your solution.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.189
We both have alter egos,

03:09.272 --> 03:11.649
and I think it's about time
we killed them off. What do you say?

03:11.941 --> 03:13.443
George Maharis can have a heart attack.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.362
- Maeby gets hit by a bus.
- Killing off Maeby?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.323
- Yup, see you.
- I know Annette can be forgetful,

03:18.406 --> 03:20.742
but she remembers Maeby
is the dominant personality, right?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.411
Hey, I got a pretty sweet setup here.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.039
Okay?
I finally got rid of my beloved Stan.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.416
He's in the hospital, massive head injury.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.711
Free rent.
New neighbors every six to eight months.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.797
Also, Maeby doesn't even have
a high school diploma.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.092
Not a good move, given the world
my generation is leaving hers.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.720
I'm glad it's easy for you, but me
and George Maharis have the same teeth.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.848
People are gonna figure it out.
If I'm not arrested for fraud,

03:43.932 --> 03:45.058
I'll be in debt for life.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.269
- I'm gonna end up in my old bedroom.
- Yeah. It's six o'clock.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.146
I'm already an hour and a half late
for dinner.

03:50.438 --> 03:54.150
And I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself,
but, uh... Annette,

03:55.026 --> 03:56.527
she like-a the pasta, hmm?

03:57.654 --> 04:00.949

04:13.211 --> 04:15.213
Playing a game

And then if I miss it, I...

04:21.344 --> 04:23.096
Uh, feel pretty bad
and beat myself up,

04:23.179 --> 04:25.390
and then I kind of try
and move past that

04:25.473 --> 04:27.141

<i>♪ Minor regression ♪</i>

04:37.318 --> 04:40.321
Well, I guess I was actually just trying
to go back to a simpler time.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.698
When I was a young boy and...

04:41.781 --> 04:43.491
all I cared about were simple things

04:43.574 --> 04:45.910
like what does it take
to be a good citizen

04:46.160 --> 04:47.912
and am I gonna be able
to fall asleep tonight,

04:47.996 --> 04:49.289
or am I getting too wound up

04:49.372 --> 04:51.416
- about this good citizen stuff?
- Well, George Michael,

04:51.499 --> 04:53.584
you've always been such
a funny little guy, you know.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.796
Of course it make sense now,
you being a computer genius.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.215
Speaking of which, question: I'm trying

04:59.299 --> 05:01.676
to gather as much capital
as possible to help out Dad,

05:01.759 --> 05:03.469
but I think that they're hiding something.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.680
I mean, they've got secret bookkeeping,
and, um,

05:05.888 --> 05:08.641
came across this file here
called "Gated Community."

05:09.017 --> 05:11.352
Each time I try to print it,
I get this root warning,

05:11.436 --> 05:12.812
- you know...
- Doesn't look

05:12.895 --> 05:14.981
like it came
from a normal printer, actually.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.817
It's not, no, I sent it
to the Smile Maker. It's a dental printer.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.862
Okay. That explains that toothbrush
next to the warning sign.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.156
And you see how they spelled
"byte" without a <i>y.</i>

05:23.448 --> 05:25.074
- No, this is for dentists.
- Listen to you.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.577
This is why you have
a billion-dollar software company

05:27.660 --> 05:29.537
and your old man has to hit "popcorn"
on the microwave

05:29.620 --> 05:31.122
any time I want to heat something up.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.125
- You hit "heat," then hit "time," then...
- Mine does not work that way.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.420
But popcorn sounds good.
Let's go make some of that. Come on.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.424
<i>Unbeknownst to the guys,</i>
<i>and directly over their heads,</i>

05:41.799 --> 05:45.345
<i>Tobias had just experienced
his own snack problems.</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:48.890
I knew it.
Okay. I had nine gummy bears

05:48.973 --> 05:50.141
wrapped in tinfoil here,

05:50.224 --> 05:52.518
and the tinfoil is still here,
but, uh, I'm super confused.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.480
Do we have magic gummy bears
that just get up and walk away?

05:55.563 --> 05:58.149
Yeah, one got up
and walked right into my mouth.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.525

06:05.823 --> 06:07.825
No! I'm the provider for this family.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.746
Yeah, you're good at that, Dad.
You're good at leaving.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.498
It... It's kind of your thing, actually.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.250
Hey, I don't have to crouch here
for this... Ow!

06:16.334 --> 06:18.169
I just don't understand
why we're still here.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.462
- Shh!
- Why are we hiding?

06:19.545 --> 06:22.465
Yeah, I thought you said
you were the sticky white glue

06:22.548 --> 06:24.634
that this family sniffs together.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.552
All right, look,
we're in a bad situation here.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.554
But, I've been jammed

06:28.638 --> 06:30.932
with bigger things
in tighter spots than this.

06:31.015 --> 06:31.933
Ah.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.102
We just need better living conditions.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.814

or just leave the lights on
so we can't see you?

07:14.767 --> 07:17.728
We can stay up late if you want
and watch it, or something.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.148
Thanks for dinner, Annette.

07:20.231 --> 07:24.152
- See you next time, Bev.
- I thought you said you lived here alone.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.987
It's my old lady.
Leave her out of it, please?

07:26.070 --> 07:27.488
She's a very sweet person.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.782
She's smiling all the time,
even when she sleeps.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.033
I always get the wrong key.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.910
- On my cue, rising.
- Mm...

07:34.996 --> 07:36.998

Your dreams. You know?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.997
What I meant was,
my dreams are your dreams.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.625
Have you ever noticed that dreams are hard
to remember?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.126
There's one I can't forget.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.170
The dream of us working together.
Do you remember

08:24.253 --> 08:27.089
how we wanted to make sure
we could hang out all day every day?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.091
- Like you and your dad.
- That was not a dream.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.968
Think I wanted to hang out with my father?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.554
That was a job.
No, but listen, I want you to know

08:33.638 --> 08:35.847
that I'm available to you 24 hours a day,

08:35.932 --> 08:37.892
any time you want,
to talk about business.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.727
And don't think
I can't handle the tech stuff.

08:39.808 --> 08:42.063
I spent those five and a half weeks
up at the Search campus.

08:42.145 --> 08:43.856

you've seen that.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.942
Well,
my problems are not that easily solved.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.152
- Oh, yeah?
- Turns out, we're way more in debt

08:48.236 --> 08:49.570
than I thought we were.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.113
- Same here.
- Yeah.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.449
I... I'm suddenly running
the Bluth Company,

08:53.533 --> 08:55.284

I don't know what it is,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.285
but we're broke.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.454
It's just, these offices
are just wiping us out.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.457
And same here.
Gob's got us on two floors now.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.418
Trying to get my employees to describe
what they're doing is like pulling teeth.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.546
I think there are
a couple of Two Hour Teeth guys

09:06.629 --> 09:10.091
still on the payroll. No one will confirm,
but I'm convinced that in the break room,

09:10.174 --> 09:12.426
there's still an active chair.
Anyway, despite all of this,

09:12.510 --> 09:14.929
you and I are gonna get through this.
You want to know why?

09:15.179 --> 09:16.847
The Bluth boys, we find a way.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.724
- We're winners.
- Agreed.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.228
Hey, so, non sequitur,
what do you know about bankruptcy?

09:22.478 --> 09:25.356
You know, I was just checking
into that. No, look.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.857
I don't know what else I can do.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.735
Dad said go in there
and save the company, find money.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.488
But despite all their shady bookkeeping,
there's nothing left.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.532
There's just... there's Sudden Valley.
That's it.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.659
The one thing that was mine.
Well, and whatever's

09:36.742 --> 09:39.996
in that file, that "Gated Community,"
but... but you're different.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.414
You're right at the beginning.

09:41.497 --> 09:45.042
You shouldn't be thinking
about bankruptcy at all, you know?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.295
Can't you get a loan?

09:47.503 --> 09:51.591
Well, I mean, Rebel offered
to buy the whole company outright.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.509
- Oh, you can't do that.
- No. I mean...

09:53.593 --> 09:55.469
- Forget about that.
- What if the software...

09:55.553 --> 09:57.179
- Is worth billions?
- ...never works?

09:58.514 --> 09:59.432
It doesn't seem likely.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.393
- These expenses are just killing us.
- Hey, hang on.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.688
Uh, I think I got a solution
for both of us.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.361
- And... open your eyes.
- Was I supposed to close them?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.739
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Well, anyway,

10:14.822 --> 10:16.866
these are the offices.
What do you think?

10:16.949 --> 10:18.868
Oh, 'cause you're
on the fourth floor now. I...

10:18.951 --> 10:21.579
Yeah, you set up Fakeblock here.
It's free rent.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.248
I don't know, I mean, you know,
this was your office.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.416
This was where you were president.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.628
Where decisions were made that you...

10:28.711 --> 10:30.171
Eventually found out about.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.298
But... but, look, you know,
this was our dream, right?

10:32.381 --> 10:33.758
To work together? Do you remember

10:33.841 --> 10:35.384
- all the dreaming we did?
- Yeah.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.094
Have lunch together.
Work out in the late afternoon.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.679
That's right,
we were gonna put a weight room

10:38.763 --> 10:40.139
- in the back office.
- You know it, yeah.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.308
Drive home together,
shower up, grab dinner,

10:42.391 --> 10:44.560
- PJs on, teeth brushed.
- A little TV.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.563
A little bit of TV, sure,
and then a little kiss good night

10:47.647 --> 10:49.690
and off to bed.
You know, I am just realizing

10:49.774 --> 10:51.651
that I'm still picturing you
as a ten-year-old.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.194
I think I was trying to engineer

10:53.277 --> 10:55.655
a way to stay up late
and watch <i>The Tom Green Show.</i>

10:55.738 --> 10:57.573
Mm, yeah, see,
I don't get the new guys.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.617
Anyway, it can be a new dream,
then, you know?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.953
I'll be able to come here all the time.
You'll be able to pop up whenever.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.122
I'm not sure it's a good idea, you know?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.707
- Yeah.
- I'm feeling anxious as it is.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.793
This is just gonna be great, isn't it?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.336
It's gonna be so much fun!

11:10.419 --> 11:14.090
<i>George Michael wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who felt shackled to his father.</i>

11:14.173 --> 11:16.425
Inside,
outside, inside, outside,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.052
inside, outside, inside...

11:18.135 --> 11:19.845
- Hello.
- Oh, no.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.765
- Ew!
- Waving with righty. We've discussed this.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.183
- Sorry.
- There's gotta be a way

11:24.266 --> 11:27.144
we can cover more ground
without attracting attention.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.231
Oh, I've got the perfect idea for that.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.529
Wet side, dry side,
wet side, dry side, wet side, dry side...

11:36.612 --> 11:38.406
Okay.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.282
Are you all right?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.951
We should have taken
the tandem bike.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.703
Nah.
Never would have fit in here.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.871
Oh, I see what you mean.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.542
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>was showing his cousin</i>

11:49.625 --> 11:51.544
<i>the new Fakeblock offices.</i>

11:51.627 --> 11:54.463
He wants me
to help him print things, and I...

11:54.547 --> 11:58.217
I will say the other place had
more of a tech start-up vibe.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.429
Yeah, but the fraud part
will be more at home here, you know?

12:01.512 --> 12:04.640
Yeah. If these walls could only testify,
huh?

12:05.933 --> 12:08.602
I don't understand the problem.
I thought Rebel said

12:08.728 --> 12:09.937
she was gonna buy the company.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.231
Well, I'm not gonna sell a bogus company
to my girlfriend.

12:12.314 --> 12:15.443
Why not? It's the perfect way
to end a terrible relationship.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.528
It's not terrible.
It's... it's a great relationship.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.156
Yes, but it won't be
once you sell her a shitty company.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.575
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You're more impossible

12:22.658 --> 12:23.826
to talk to than Annette.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.537
- You talk to Annette?
- No.

12:27.663 --> 12:28.706
But Stan does.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.000
And as much as we try to infuriate him,

12:31.083 --> 12:34.211
he won't get the hint.
What do I gotta do, hit him on the head?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.589
But, next thing you know,
he's back from the hospital.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.258
- So you actually did hit him?
- Yeah, just with a wine bottle,

12:39.341 --> 12:40.176
but it wasn't open.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.302
I guess I could do it again,

12:41.385 --> 12:43.929
but I just can't send him back
to the ER <i>again, </i> you know?

12:44.013 --> 12:45.055
Three times in one week.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.058
People are gonna start asking,
you know, elderly abuse?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.852
Which apparently is a real thing.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.604
I guess all old people
are this annoying.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.606
Well, so, I've looked into
selling the company

12:53.689 --> 12:55.524
to somebody else,
but the thing is that tech companies

12:55.608 --> 12:57.902
don't normally sell
without a whole lot of vetting.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.445
And anyone I've talked to will only do it

12:59.528 --> 13:02.198
if the president stays on,
so before we find a clueless buyer,

13:02.281 --> 13:03.866
we're gonna have to find
a clueless president.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.368
And it's not gonna be me.
Someone that's stupid

13:06.452 --> 13:08.412
and lazy enough
that he doesn't ask any questions

13:08.496 --> 13:09.955
- about the actual software.
- Oh, I love

13:10.039 --> 13:11.457
how you're assuming it's a he.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.958
I know what you're thinking!

13:13.042 --> 13:15.085
Look who's back.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.255
After your father
unceremoniously let me quit.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.591
Now I'm back down
on the third floor without so much

13:20.674 --> 13:22.802
as a "feel free
to use the third floor" joke.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.304
Anyway...

13:25.387 --> 13:28.057
what are you two doing down here
after a long mid-weekend?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.518
Well, Dad said we could use
the offices for Fakeblock.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.145
He actually said,
"Feel free to use the third floor."

13:33.354 --> 13:36.065
Mm. Now I'm glad I gave
one of those offices away.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.943
- You gave an office away?
- Well, just one of the smaller ones.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.778
You won't even know
it's being used.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.489
...because an actor's body
is his instrument.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.366
Come get my shower ready
and then take over

13:45.449 --> 13:47.117
- on the elliptical.
- I'm on it. I got it.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.161
No, you can't take another shower.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.456
I'm still in socks,
and I'm about to serve food.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.624
Well, what's for dinner?

13:53.707 --> 13:55.668
Turkey jerky, popcorn,

13:55.751 --> 13:59.380
- and leftover Jeff.
- Aw. There's no Linda left?

13:59.463 --> 14:00.881
You know, I don't want to jinx it,

14:00.965 --> 14:03.551
but this certainly is better
than living in that attic, yes?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.052
- Oh, definitely.
- It's so great, Dad.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.929
And what's our number one rule?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.472
Don't tell Michael.

14:08.556 --> 14:12.476
Well, yes, but I also meant, 88 more days,
and squatter's rights kick in.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.396
<i>♪ 88 days and squatter's rights kick in ♪</i>

14:15.479 --> 14:17.356
♪ <i>88 days and squatter's rights kick in</i> ♪

14:17.439 --> 14:18.691
♪ <i>88 days and squatter's rights...</i> ♪

14:18.774 --> 14:23.070
This is going too fast now.
Murphybrown, this is going too fast.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.656
- All right, sorry.
- Switch it back. Oh!

14:25.739 --> 14:28.534
Oh, God! Oh, God!

14:28.617 --> 14:31.871
Anyway, I'm just stopping by here
'cause this is where my e-mail comes.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.873
You could check
your e-mail anywhere.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.791
Uh, yeah, e-mail, but this is g-mail.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.459
Down here on the third floor
set it up for me,

14:37.751 --> 14:39.503
and then when we moved
to the fourth,

14:39.587 --> 14:41.839
I was like, screw it,
I'll just come down here to check it,

14:41.922 --> 14:43.757
'cause I don't want wires
going everywhere.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.175
You can use your phone for that.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.760
Yeah, and I could use a pigeon.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.472
But for this particular task,
I've chosen e-mail.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.475
Anyway, I sent my résumé out,

14:53.642 --> 14:56.061
and the only firm that's gotten back to me

14:56.145 --> 14:57.897
is the gang over at Mailer Daemon.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.524
Aw, damn it! God, missed him again.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.276
It seems like they write me back

15:02.359 --> 15:04.153
every time I step away
from this thing.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.071
Well, on the other hand,
this is on them,

15:06.155 --> 15:09.992
'cause I made it clear that I was looking
for a three-day-a-week president job,

15:10.075 --> 15:12.369
and why... why...

15:14.496 --> 15:18.500
Why-why... when...

15:18.584 --> 15:20.961
when... what kind of... when... what...?

15:21.837 --> 15:24.006
You're looking for a president job?

15:27.176 --> 15:30.304
- I'll be damned, it is a he.
- Who e-mails back...

15:30.387 --> 15:32.514
What? At Wednesday at nap?

15:32.598 --> 15:33.849
Hey, Gob, we want to beat

15:33.933 --> 15:35.267
Mailer Daemon to the punch.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.603
Come to Fakeblock. Be <i>our </i> president.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.730
You won't need
to get your e-mail redelivered.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.732
Yeah. You already know the lay
of the office.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.692
You won't have to learn new snacks.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.444
And everybody knows you,

15:45.527 --> 15:47.321
so there won't be
gaining everyone's respect.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.114
And the best part is,
you get paid in stock.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.492
Right. Money never has to change hands.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.912
I'm listening.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.374
- That's it. We're done talking.
- Mm-hmm.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.626
Can I get back to you?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.252
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.797
- Great!
- Well, looks like

16:04.880 --> 16:07.049
I'm gonna need
that office space after all.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.636
This is not gonna be
an easy conversation.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.055
But mostly thankful
for the one man

16:13.138 --> 16:14.098
who made this all possible.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.434
Who took this ragtag,
talented troupe of a family

16:17.518 --> 16:19.269
and... and put a roof
over their head,

16:19.728 --> 16:22.314
Jeff in their mouth,
and gave us the dignity

16:22.398 --> 16:25.109
to move as we will
after work hours.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.236
To my brother-in-law Gob.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.362
Long may...

16:29.488 --> 16:31.073
I need you guys out of here.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.741
And we're on the move again.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.076
I don't want to go back
to living in that attic.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.453
And the heat made me like,
"What's happening? Who are you?"

16:36.745 --> 16:38.414
- We'll figure something out, Murphybrown.
- Okay, I hate to be

16:38.497 --> 16:40.416
the one to suggest it,
but I know about a tent city.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.418
Well, there you go.
We're down a rung,

16:42.501 --> 16:44.086
but we're down a rung together.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.588
Thanks, guys.
My first day as president,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.424
and kicking people out makes it...

16:48.507 --> 16:50.884
- makes it seem real.
- Oh, Gob. Something came for you.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.261
Hmm.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.181
Powerful Gay Tastemakers?

16:56.682 --> 16:57.683
The Gay Mafia.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.269
- What?
- That's the Gay Mafia.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.770
Surely you've heard of them.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.981
Very flattering. That's the real deal.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.152
I wonder if this is from Tony.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.779
Maybe this is how
he's trying to reach out to me.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.365
Wow. So I guess...

17:13.866 --> 17:16.076
I guess sometimes
things do work out, after all.

17:17.117 --> 17:19.288
- So we can stay?
- No.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.622
For me.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.333
Things work out for me.

17:23.415 --> 17:25.711
<i>And while things</i>
<i>were working out for Gob,</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:28.672
<i>upstairs,
things were not working out so well</i>

17:28.756 --> 17:31.300
<i>- for Michael.</i>
- Remember, Mom doesn't want me

17:31.383 --> 17:33.510
to see the file, so I guess
this is what you'd call a...

17:33.677 --> 17:36.472
- Don't tell Gangee.
- You see the fun we have?

17:36.972 --> 17:39.141
I know you do.
Come on, the printer's in here.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.935
So, it is a three-dimensional printer,
but I've just let it go all day.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.606
What is this?

17:45.689 --> 17:47.149
Is this the printer
you sent the file to?

17:47.983 --> 17:50.027
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think so.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.237
The... the file that was labeled
"Gated Community."

17:55.074 --> 17:57.576
I think that this is

17:58.077 --> 18:01.038
a map that they did not want me to see.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.958
It looks like a wall on the border, but...

18:05.667 --> 18:07.044
made out of teeth?

18:07.920 --> 18:11.924
She's crazy. She's totally crazy.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.717
That might be a setting
in the printer.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.761
Let me see what we have here.
Yeah. See?

18:15.844 --> 18:17.930
Right here. You have to uncheck
"Presume Teeth."

18:18.013 --> 18:19.431
This is what they need me
to find money for.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.016
This is their secret project, huh?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.560
Well, there's only one way
to find out for sure.

18:23.727 --> 18:24.937
Uncheck "Presume Teeth."

18:25.020 --> 18:26.396
And print again.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.941
<i>And as they went to do so,</i>

18:29.149 --> 18:31.318
<i>Gob went to meet with the Gay Mafia,</i>

18:31.819 --> 18:35.197
<i>hoping to run into
his old friend Tony Wonder.</i>

18:35.697 --> 18:37.866
Are there any tastemakers?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.121
Tastemakers?

18:42.204 --> 18:45.916
You sold a French Regency armoire,
and you don't think I'm gonna hear?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.168
I want my taste. If not...

18:49.253 --> 18:50.420
Listen to this.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.975
- Mmm.
- That was me tap-dancing on your grave,

19:03.058 --> 19:04.059
all right?

19:04.601 --> 19:06.186
Yeah, I think I'm in the wrong place.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.480
- I was looking for a guy named Tony.
- No, Mr. Bluth.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.441
You're exactly in the right place.
Take a seat.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.569
No, yeah, you know what? I... I'm fine.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.029
We wanted to congratulate you
on your coming out.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.490
So brave.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.534
- So brave.
- So brave.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.952
So brave. But you know what?
Thank you. It's...

19:22.035 --> 19:23.495
- The struggle is...
- Oh, shut up.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.248
We know you're as straight
as an Oklahoma highway.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.749
They're straight, right?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.626
I wouldn't know.
I've never been in Oklahoma.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.211
You were in <i>Oklahoma!</i>

19:31.378 --> 19:33.338
You're right. In the bus and truck.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.050
♪ <i>You're doin' fine, Oklahoma</i> ♪

19:37.134 --> 19:42.306
♪ <i>Oklahoma, O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A</i> ♪

19:42.389 --> 19:45.392
♪ <i>Oklahoma</i> ♪

19:48.520 --> 19:50.147
Is that a song? I...

19:51.023 --> 19:52.232
You're straight.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.943
No, no, no. I'm... I'm gay.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.154
Yeah, sure, because of your trick.

19:57.237 --> 20:01.658
<i>Gob had recently performed</i>
<i>a sexuality switch illusion at a parade.</i>

20:01.742 --> 20:06.580
<i>It ended unexpectedly when his partner
had a premature emulsification.</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:09.499
<i>This left Gob
publicly out of the closet...</i>

20:09.833 --> 20:11.335
Who's straight now?

20:11.418 --> 20:12.669
<i>...with no way back in</i>

20:13.253 --> 20:15.005
<i>and a sexual identity</i>

20:15.088 --> 20:17.674
<i>the magician's code precluded him
from undoing.</i>

20:17.758 --> 20:19.843
Well, that son of a buck
gonna have to stay gay.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.970
Unfortunately for you,
we also caught your appearance

20:22.054 --> 20:23.889
on that religious program

20:23.972 --> 20:28.060
<i>And As It Is Such, So Also</i>
<i>As Such It Is...</i> what is it?

20:28.143 --> 20:29.937
- "Unto you," boss.
<i>- Unto You.</i>

20:30.312 --> 20:32.189
- Yes.
<i>- Where Gob announced</i>

20:32.272 --> 20:35.192
<i>he was seeking Christian
sexuality conversion...</i>

20:35.275 --> 20:36.235
To Christianity!

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
<i>...so he could find a plausible way...</i>

20:38.528 --> 20:41.156
To not being into guys, I guess.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.201
You are talking
about praying away the gay.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.452
<i>...to lead a public life</i>

20:45.535 --> 20:47.079
<i>- as a straight man.</i>
- Well, yeah, I...

20:47.162 --> 20:48.789
Sure, I guess it could get me off.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.958
- I mean, out.
- That sends a message

20:51.041 --> 20:54.336
that conversion therapy works,
which will hurt us.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.755
And we're the ones
doing the hurting.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.260
Oh, right, then there'd be less gays
that would suck the gays out.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.803
- No.
- I mean, off.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.097
Because it's a destructive sham
that thinks

21:05.180 --> 21:08.183
that homosexuality can be cured
through shame and fear,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.477
you pathetic little dipshit.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.688
You're right, I hear you.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.941
And I'll cancel my appointment.
I'll lose my deposit, but right is right.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.735
It's too late for that. You said on TV

21:18.819 --> 21:20.404
you're going into conversion therapy,

21:20.487 --> 21:21.947
so you are going to go.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.408
And then you're going
to announce it didn't work.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.537
So... I have to stay gay?

21:28.829 --> 21:31.373
Just for seven years.
Then we'll let you age out.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.959
It's a lot more generous than what I did

21:34.042 --> 21:35.502
to that last guy
who faked being gay.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.754
You know him. Your pal Tony Wonder.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.924
Don't worry. We took care of him.
Didn't we, boys?

21:41.174 --> 21:42.801
- We sure did.
- We sure did.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.262
Now, do as you're told,
and you will have made

21:45.345 --> 21:47.306
some very powerful friends.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.018
- In case you ever need a favor.
- Austero.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.812
Yes, I think I was shacking up
with your ex-wife.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.023
She was my sister.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.441
My apologies.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.901
Think I was shacking up with your sister.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.570
Maybe he is gay.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.780
You know,
I hope you don't think...

22:03.864 --> 22:05.449
I mean, I...
Listen, I want you to know,

22:05.532 --> 22:07.701
my brother probably
didn't have anything to do

22:07.784 --> 22:10.245
with your sister's disappearance.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.039
I'm not worried about it.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.833
To be honest, we fought all the time,

22:14.916 --> 22:17.419
so it's probably better
for our relationship

22:17.502 --> 22:19.504
that she's no longer around.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.090
Tell me about it.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.760
My sister and I
don't get along, either. She just left...

22:26.094 --> 22:28.638
Now that you know
about our organization,

22:28.722 --> 22:31.141
we're going to ask
for a little insurance to make sure

22:31.224 --> 22:33.226
you will always be loyal to us.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.065
Since you're so good at magic,

22:38.148 --> 22:40.067
why don't you
make that disappear.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.572
Is that what I think it is?

22:45.655 --> 22:47.616
- Yes, it's what you think it is.
- Yeah.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.576
We got as much of the cement off
as we could.

22:49.659 --> 22:51.620
Don't need it traced back to us.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.622
You mention this to anyone,

22:53.705 --> 22:55.916
and this is the last sound
you're going to hear.

22:55.999 --> 23:00.087
You're gonna... tap-dance on <i>my </i> grave?

23:01.880 --> 23:05.300
Oh, hell, you saw the matinee.
Out you go.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.803
Chop-chop. I want it off my floor

23:07.886 --> 23:09.346
and somewhere
no one will find it.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.889
I don't have all day.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.058
I've got to get out
of these work clothes.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.394
I have house seats
for Chita Rivera tonight.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.270
I don't know who he is.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.525
Stupid day to take an Uber.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.111
<i>On the next </i> Arrested Development.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.823
<i>Tobias's family settles in at a tent city.</i>

23:27.906 --> 23:30.409
Looks like your old man
came through with that camping trip.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.244
Although we should stay together

23:32.327 --> 23:33.745
- just to be safe.
- That's right.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.497
We need to keep
a low profile.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.707
Tent City is all about survival.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.919
So I say
we just hunker down, okay?

23:41.002 --> 23:42.879
I bet this place
gets a lot quieter after dark.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.217
Also, we could always go
to the food court.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.719
Oh, and maybe we can ask
them to turn down the birds.
