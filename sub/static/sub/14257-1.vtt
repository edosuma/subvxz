01:18.014 --> 01:19.028
Hey, dudes.

01:19.422 --> 01:22.151
Anyone for a slice of
granola and licorice pizza ?

01:22.463 --> 01:25.314
No, thanks, Michelangelo.
We're still stuffed

01:25.881 --> 01:28.206
from the peanut butter and
pickle pizza you made for lunch.

01:28.675 --> 01:31.761
Is something wrong,
master Splinter ?

01:32.383 --> 01:34.042
Indeed there is, Leonardo.

01:34.601 --> 01:35.969
Why are the four of you

01:36.315 --> 01:38.130
not doing your daily katas ?

01:38.858 --> 01:41.219
We thought we'd take
time off, and--oh !

01:41.885 --> 01:44.081
What Donatello is
trying to say, sensei,

01:44.456 --> 01:46.999
Is that we thought
we deserved a little vacation.

01:48.923 --> 01:50.981
Saka-ju-wee-ah !

01:54.975 --> 01:55.756
Master !

01:58.484 --> 02:01.244
You are losing your
fighting edge, my turtles.

02:01.697 --> 02:03.488
Were it Shredder
who attacked you,

02:03.851 --> 02:05.502
he would not be so lenient.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.469
Come on, master Splinter,

02:08.014 --> 02:10.107
we already sent
chrome-dome and Krang

02:10.467 --> 02:11.524
to the earth's core.

02:11.774 --> 02:14.722
Yeah, right. Those dudes
are totally dusted.

02:15.112 --> 02:16.630
Without positive proof,

02:16.935 --> 02:18.674
it would be unwise to assume

02:18.934 --> 02:21.104
that Shredder and Krang
have been vanquished.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.566
beyond that, may I remind you

02:23.894 --> 02:26.160
that you are still crime fighters,

02:26.453 --> 02:28.017
and that the streets of this city

02:28.308 --> 02:29.790
are still filled with crime.

02:30.230 --> 02:34.661
I suggest doing each ninja 
exercise twice.

02:35.126 --> 02:37.358
You obviously need the practice.

02:37.674 --> 02:39.400
Well, you heard master Splinter.

02:39.731 --> 02:40.996
Let's do it !

02:53.928 --> 02:54.899
Blast it, Krang !

02:55.360 --> 02:57.549
When will we be able
to return to the surface ?

02:57.940 --> 02:59.853
We are very low on power,

03:00.288 --> 03:01.340
and we need to replace

03:01.680 --> 03:04.407
a number of vital
electronic components.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.713
Also, the protein silicon brain

03:08.045 --> 03:10.369
of the main computer has an owee

03:10.869 --> 03:13.881
thanks to your bumbling
incompetence.

03:14.224 --> 03:16.485
The problem is, how are we
going to fix it ?

03:16.809 --> 03:19.562
I know of something that might help,

03:19.866 --> 03:21.833
but it's on the surface of the earth.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.755
You'll have to go get it.

03:24.255 --> 03:27.043
I've modified the antimatter cannons

03:27.375 --> 03:29.290
to bore holes to the surface.

03:29.555 --> 03:32.833
these pneumatic modules
will carry you there.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.452
It won't be a pleasant journey, but...

03:36.673 --> 03:38.134
nothing could be more unpleasant

03:38.369 --> 03:39.977
than being stuck here with you.

03:40.506 --> 03:44.344
Uh, what's up, boss ?

03:45.155 --> 03:46.574
We're going back to the surface.

03:46.954 --> 03:48.590
And if we're very lucky,

03:48.914 --> 03:50.854
we might get to
dispose of the turtles

03:51.101 --> 03:52.018
while we're there.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.998
A pleasure trip !

04:03.019 --> 04:05.626
Oh, man. I am one tired turtle.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.075
Yeah, tell me about it.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.992
Splinter's really
working us to the max.

04:12.065 --> 04:14.921
Six hours of exercises a day !

04:15.278 --> 04:17.478
And now we're out
patrolling the streets.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.348
The city seems pretty quiet tonight.

04:20.723 --> 04:21.829
It's a good thing.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.940
Right now I couldn't
fight a parking ticket.

04:24.687 --> 04:27.867
Dudes, scope out the all-night theater.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.144
All right !
A kung fu movie marathon !

04:31.771 --> 04:33.131
Let's go check it out.

04:33.568 --> 04:36.697
Master splinter might
not like that idea.

04:37.392 --> 04:39.912
Come on, Leonardo,
we deserve a night off.

04:40.275 --> 04:41.350
Well...

04:41.350 --> 04:42.568
Ok.

04:47.961 --> 04:49.306
4 tickets, please.

04:49.572 --> 04:51.211
Did you say 4 ?

04:51.586 --> 04:54.450
Yeah, that's right, lady--4, like this.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.901
And I thought what we had
on the screen was weird.

05:08.552 --> 05:10.632
Guys, let's turn off our turtlecoms.

05:11.301 --> 05:13.893
Wait a minute, Donatello. what if...

05:14.205 --> 05:15.232
Come on, bud,

05:15.510 --> 05:17.807
The world can live without us 
for one night.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.332
We deserve a break.

05:34.403 --> 05:37.431
I hated ridin' in that thing !

05:39.162 --> 05:42.316
Plays heck with my sinuses.

05:42.763 --> 05:44.889
Oh, stop complaining, you cretins,

05:45.182 --> 05:48.512
Or i'll send you back down
the shaft without the module !

05:52.892 --> 05:54.089
The turtles are late

05:54.360 --> 05:55.875
in returning from their patrol.

06:00.897 --> 06:01.877
No response.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.278
I hope nothing has happened to them.

06:18.630 --> 06:20.069
And where do you think
you're going ?

06:20.337 --> 06:22.078
The press conference is about to start.

06:22.551 --> 06:24.004
Right, vernon. I...

06:24.307 --> 06:26.215
I just have to powder my nose.

06:29.267 --> 06:31.428
Yes, Splinter ?
What is it ?

06:31.795 --> 06:34.276
April, have you seen
the turtles tonight ?

06:34.531 --> 06:36.570
No, I haven't. Are they all right ?

06:36.864 --> 06:38.832
That is what i'm trying
to determine.

06:39.145 --> 06:40.505
Let me know if i can be of help.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.218
I've got to sign off now.

06:42.481 --> 06:43.978
I'm covering a story at metro hospital.

06:44.455 --> 06:46.904
I don't care how shiny your nose is.

06:47.459 --> 06:49.641
They're about to start without us.

06:49.939 --> 06:51.642
Whatever you say, Vernon.

06:52.046 --> 06:53.574
Women reporters !

06:56.295 --> 06:57.771
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

06:58.133 --> 07:01.286
this is a prototype of the new 
medi-laser gun.

07:01.595 --> 07:04.961
It's the most advanced instrument
known to man for healing.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.082
And it's just what we need

07:07.394 --> 07:09.469
to heal the protein silicon computer.

07:10.004 --> 07:10.797
Take it !

07:11.640 --> 07:12.937
I'll take that.

07:13.837 --> 07:15.603
And you can take this.

07:20.624 --> 07:21.767
April to turtles !

07:22.418 --> 07:23.436
Come in, turtles !

07:26.320 --> 07:27.494
Yeah !

07:29.008 --> 07:30.037
Go get him !

07:30.284 --> 07:31.111
Yeah !

07:31.406 --> 07:33.732
They've stolen the
medi-laser prototype !

07:34.024 --> 07:35.087
It's the only one in the world !

07:35.415 --> 07:36.708
I can't reach the turtles.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.128
Splinter, come in.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.659
What is it, April ?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.236
Something terrible has happened.

07:42.946 --> 07:43.431
Man !

07:43.840 --> 07:46.536
<i>that was one
fabuloso flick.</i>

07:47.005 --> 07:50.562
Yeah ! You know, Somebody ought
to make A movie about us.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.138
<i>teenage mutant
ninja turtles.</i>

07:53.979 --> 07:55.460
it's got a nice
ring to it.

07:55.788 --> 07:57.861
we better check in
with master splinter.

07:58.425 --> 08:00.296
Hey, like,
What's the rush ?

08:00.559 --> 08:02.636
Let's scarf
Some pizza first, huh ?

08:03.617 --> 08:04.865
what do you think
might have happened

08:04.865 --> 08:06.227
to the turtles,
splinter ?

08:06.473 --> 08:07.771
Either their communicators
Are broken

08:08.064 --> 08:09.966
Or they've turned them off.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.109
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

08:11.358 --> 08:13.996
<i>strange mutants reported
in the downtown area--</i>

08:14.290 --> 08:16.971
<i>a rhino and a warthog.
investigate immediately.</i>

08:17.517 --> 08:20.311
that can only be bebop
and rock steady.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.403
Just as i feared
-- Shredder is alive And back on earth.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.219
We must find him
And stop him !

08:34.193 --> 08:35.149
someone
in that building

08:35.486 --> 08:37.111
has just come
from a hospital.

08:37.426 --> 08:38.347
How can you tell ?

08:38.640 --> 08:42.181
my keen sense of smell detects
the odor of disinfectant.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.696
also, that ambulance is
double-parked in front of it.

08:46.007 --> 08:47.079
It's got
To be shredder !

08:47.361 --> 08:48.265
come on !

08:48.547 --> 08:50.887
April, wait.
It will be dangerous.

08:51.202 --> 08:52.479
Stay here.

08:56.142 --> 08:59.783
oh, do we have to ride
in this thing, boss ?

09:00.417 --> 09:03.359
I'd use this medi-laser
On your brain

09:03.634 --> 09:05.861
If it weren't
Such a small target !

09:06.928 --> 09:10.822
i suggest you return that instrument
to its proper owners, shredder !

09:12.717 --> 09:13.692
get him !

09:19.893 --> 09:21.245
you are quick, old one,

09:21.733 --> 09:24.053
but a laser blast
is even quicker.

09:26.563 --> 09:28.984
reversing the polarity
of the medi-laser

09:29.234 --> 09:31.994
makes it as deadly
as it can be healing.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.171
rock steady !
bebop !

09:40.450 --> 09:42.756
Come on, you
Incompetent buffoons !

09:44.987 --> 09:47.770
We could've beat him,
But he fights fair.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.920
splinter !

10:08.656 --> 10:09.370
april.

10:09.978 --> 10:11.304
thank goodness
you're here.

10:11.854 --> 10:13.738
What's wrong
With master splinter ?

10:14.158 --> 10:15.647
shredder
did this.

10:15.952 --> 10:17.266
shredder ?
shredder ? Shredder ?

10:17.518 --> 10:19.307
with a new
medi-laser weapon.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.401
He's in a coma.

10:21.819 --> 10:23.004
It looks like
The medi-laser

10:23.294 --> 10:24.694
Short-circuited
His brain functions.

10:25.456 --> 10:26.299
If that's the case,

10:26.624 --> 10:29.571
Maybe another blast At reverse
frequency Will save him.

10:30.246 --> 10:31.802
oh, if only
we'd obeyed him

10:32.118 --> 10:33.776
instead
of goofing off !

10:34.271 --> 10:36.266
Yeah, we never should've
Gone to that movie.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.249
or stopped for a pizza.

10:38.854 --> 10:40.541
even though
it was delicious.

10:40.853 --> 10:43.367
there'll be plenty of time
to blame ourselves later.

10:43.692 --> 10:46.381
right now, we've got to
save splinter.

10:46.639 --> 10:47.951
for that, we'll need
the medi-laser.

10:48.386 --> 10:49.483
Shredder's got it.

10:49.746 --> 10:50.890
then
we'll find him--

10:51.138 --> 10:53.596
if we have to look under
every rock in the city !

11:02.866 --> 11:05.099
So, finally you're here ?

11:05.500 --> 11:08.000
And you've brought
The medi-laser.

11:08.277 --> 11:11.121
This will heal
The protein silicon brain

11:11.349 --> 11:13.284
Of the central computer
In no time !

11:13.757 --> 11:14.786
you're welcome.

11:22.886 --> 11:23.678
blast !

11:24.052 --> 11:25.780
Was that
Really necessary ?

11:26.207 --> 11:29.418
the directional control
module is missing.

11:29.791 --> 11:32.425
i can't aim the
medi-laser without it.

11:32.846 --> 11:34.051
oh, great !

11:34.343 --> 11:35.530
it must have
broken off

11:35.767 --> 11:37.331
during my battle
with splinter.

11:37.683 --> 11:39.149
we're returning
to the surface.

11:39.540 --> 11:41.852
Aw, gee, boss,
We're tired.

11:42.144 --> 11:45.045
yeah ! How come we got
to go with you again ?

11:45.654 --> 11:47.385
because
i love your company

11:48.329 --> 11:51.213
and because we might run
into the turtles this time !

11:53.007 --> 11:54.593
leonardo: well,
so far, no good.

11:54.958 --> 11:57.686
not a sign of shredder
or his mutants anywhere.

11:58.745 --> 12:01.160
Hey, don't look now,
Compadres,

12:01.524 --> 12:04.877
<i>but i think we've hit
el jackpot-o grande.</i>

12:05.669 --> 12:06.612
it's shredder !

12:06.873 --> 12:07.933
Let's do it !

12:11.129 --> 12:14.329
I say, what in blazes
Do you think you're doing ?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.027
oh, sorry, sir.

12:16.357 --> 12:18.339
we thought you were
someone else.

12:18.697 --> 12:22.362
Yeah. I guess it's that
funny cape you're wearing.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.659
what now,
fearless leader ?

12:24.919 --> 12:26.170
i don't know, raphael.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.108
i guess we head back
to the sewers

12:28.323 --> 12:29.903
and think of
a new strategy.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.004
any luck, guys ?

12:32.004 --> 12:33.070
zip.
zero.

12:33.070 --> 12:34.111
<i>nada.</i>

12:34.373 --> 12:36.032
if only we had
some kind of clue

12:36.573 --> 12:39.027
or something to use
as bait for shredder.

12:39.460 --> 12:40.664
hey, will this help ?

12:40.932 --> 12:42.969
i found it on the basement
floor where splinter was.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.800
will it ever ! it's a
directional control module.

12:47.056 --> 12:48.947
the medi-laser
is useless without it.

12:49.262 --> 12:51.458
That means Shredder's
got to Come back for it.

12:51.928 --> 12:54.560
exact-a-mundo !
and when he does,

12:54.997 --> 12:57.492
we'll be on him like
cheese on a pizza.

13:04.333 --> 13:08.011
how come we always
got to travel tourist ?

13:08.264 --> 13:10.727
Oh, will you shut up
And find the component !

13:11.023 --> 13:12.067
right, boss.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.532
watch it, dipstick !

13:16.532 --> 13:18.588
you watch it,
lame-o !

13:19.239 --> 13:21.879
why can't i find
competent help ?

13:22.203 --> 13:23.908
it ain't here,
boss.

13:25.551 --> 13:27.322
Splinter's body
is also missing,

13:27.712 --> 13:32.566
which means the turtles probably
found both him and the module.

13:32.811 --> 13:33.845
it'll take forever

13:34.126 --> 13:35.421
to search the sewers
for them,

13:35.838 --> 13:37.886
but perhaps
ther

13:38.324 --> 13:41.987
uh, what way's
that, boss ?

13:42.535 --> 13:45.323
it involves you two
doing what you do best--

13:45.621 --> 13:48.418
mindless violence
and destruction.

13:48.824 --> 13:51.396
ooh, i like
the sound of that.

13:51.396 --> 13:53.387
yeah.
me, too.

13:55.061 --> 13:56.478
will you fellas
calm down ?

13:56.713 --> 13:59.097
shredder's bound to
show up sooner or later.

13:59.317 --> 14:00.379
Yeah, but when ?

14:00.657 --> 14:01.612
It's been hours.

14:02.051 --> 14:03.231
Splinter
Might get worse.

14:03.629 --> 14:04.496
He might even...

14:07.896 --> 14:09.775
i read you, raphael.
what's up ?

14:10.149 --> 14:12.093
I am,
About 500 feet up,

14:12.406 --> 14:14.329
And i'm looking At trouble
right here In river city.

14:15.169 --> 14:18.166
Rock steady and bebop
Are on a r

14:18.631 --> 14:19.866
we're on our way.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.514
hey, michelangelo,

14:24.808 --> 14:28.135
how come you're not
shouting "cowabunga" ?

14:28.618 --> 14:31.453
well, to be honest, i'm
getting kind of bored with it.

14:31.686 --> 14:32.768
hey, how about this ?

14:32.999 --> 14:34.346
yabba dabba--

14:35.526 --> 14:37.599
nah. It's
just not you.

14:39.943 --> 14:43.513
This is The part of
our job I really love.

14:43.858 --> 14:44.744
yeah.

14:44.995 --> 14:47.465
now to break up
that little party.

14:50.817 --> 14:52.922
turtle power !

14:53.841 --> 14:54.685
Well, well.

14:55.148 --> 14:57.928
look what crawled out
from under a rock !

15:09.685 --> 15:11.269
heads up, guys.

15:11.269 --> 15:13.691
this sneezing powder
ought to blow them away.

15:19.572 --> 15:22.584
let's make mincemeat
out of these mutants !

15:23.219 --> 15:24.366
Come on. Let's--

15:27.899 --> 15:28.962
Get out of here !

15:30.355 --> 15:32.532
they dove into the bay.
after them !

15:33.282 --> 15:35.517
Dive into That
yuck ? Forget it.

15:35.889 --> 15:36.855
donatello's right.

15:37.152 --> 15:38.336
we won't be able
to tell them

15:38.602 --> 15:40.052
from the rest
of the garbage.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.473
i'm afraid you're right.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.187
we better go back
to the lair.

15:43.613 --> 15:46.932
My plan is
Working perfectly.

15:47.342 --> 15:49.182
We'll follow them
Back to their hideout

15:49.524 --> 15:51.486
And get
The missing module.

15:56.154 --> 15:57.451
And once i have it,

15:57.821 --> 16:00.223
This gas grenade
Will dispose of them

16:00.535 --> 16:02.269
Once and for all !

16:08.774 --> 16:10.011
Raphael:
We're almost home.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.486
hey ! Maybe splinter will
be feeling better, huh ?

16:14.264 --> 16:15.810
I doubt it,
Michelangelo.

16:16.091 --> 16:18.600
only the medi-laser
can help him recover.

16:23.331 --> 16:24.685
hold everything !

16:24.964 --> 16:27.407
shredder and his
goons are behind us.

16:27.886 --> 16:28.823
oh, boy,

16:29.052 --> 16:31.678
Just when you thought It was safe
to go Back in the sewers, huh ?

16:31.947 --> 16:33.363
they must be
after this.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.261
come out and
face us, shredder,

16:35.513 --> 16:37.370
man against turtle !

16:37.889 --> 16:39.116
the module !

16:39.747 --> 16:41.973
this should
do the trick.

16:43.918 --> 16:45.250
a gas
grenade !

16:47.585 --> 16:48.427
all right !

16:48.726 --> 16:50.071
home run,
my man.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.112
get them, you fools !

16:52.421 --> 16:53.787
i must have
that module.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.451
one module
coming up.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.005
boy, you guys
could use a bath.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.260
yo, shredder.

17:08.604 --> 17:11.252
<i>try one of these sais
on for size.</i>

17:12.595 --> 17:13.532
what ?

17:18.365 --> 17:19.256
I'll take that...

17:19.990 --> 17:21.275
And this, too !

17:21.923 --> 17:23.964
not so fast,
metal-mouth !

17:31.251 --> 17:33.059
I believe
You wanted this.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.430
great. Now we've
got the medi-laser,

17:35.966 --> 17:37.991
but shredder's
got the module.

17:38.346 --> 17:41.248
Boy, oh, boy. Some days,
It just doesn't pay

17:41.465 --> 17:42.839
To come out
Of your shell.

17:43.075 --> 17:45.951
donatello, can you rig
up some sort of substitute

17:45.951 --> 17:47.320
for the module ?

17:47.757 --> 17:49.193
I suppose i could try.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.187
well, let's hurry.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.730
master splinter
is running out of time !

17:54.929 --> 17:56.939
krang, i'll need
reinforcements.

17:57.158 --> 17:59.688
send me a dozen of
my foot soldiers.

18:00.033 --> 18:05.130
a dozen to handle
four adolescent amphibians ?

18:05.457 --> 18:08.427
Do you want The
medi-laser, Or don't you ?

18:08.912 --> 18:13.070
oh, very well, but
two foot soldiers

18:13.278 --> 18:15.972
are all i can spare.
krang out.

18:24.802 --> 18:27.882
what do we have to use
those robots for ?

18:28.155 --> 18:29.326
yeah.

18:29.326 --> 18:31.626
They're so ugly.

18:31.983 --> 18:33.386
wait. What's this ?

18:33.386 --> 18:34.789
they've built
a new medi-laser

18:34.789 --> 18:36.472
to replace the one i stole.

18:36.798 --> 18:39.052
perfect. I'll steal
the new medi-laser.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.435
That way, i won't have to deal
With those blasted turtles.

18:42.838 --> 18:46.833
...while the cost of living
index has increased 3.2%.

18:47.176 --> 18:48.298
Oh, it's no use.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.859
I can't get it to work.

18:50.173 --> 18:51.483
and in local news,

18:51.751 --> 18:54.788
metro hospital has just
completed a second medi-laser

18:55.004 --> 18:56.879
to replace
the stolen prototype.

18:57.207 --> 18:58.795
whoa ! You hear that,
bros ?

18:59.155 --> 19:01.217
maybe we could use
that one instead.

19:01.452 --> 19:03.899
and i'm betting that
shredder's got the same idea.

19:03.899 --> 19:04.742
come on !

19:04.974 --> 19:07.038
we'd better get to the
hospital before he does !

19:12.624 --> 19:14.421
the medi-laser is ours !

19:14.829 --> 19:16.653
now let's get it
back to krang

19:16.857 --> 19:18.622
before something else
goes wrong.

19:19.213 --> 19:20.990
Don't look now, boss,

19:21.303 --> 19:23.472
but i think
something just did.

19:23.952 --> 19:26.343
blast ! Back to the sewers,
quickly !

19:26.793 --> 19:28.099
What are they, nuts ?

19:28.356 --> 19:29.539
Hiding from us
In the sewers

19:29.771 --> 19:31.097
Is like trying
To hide a pizza

19:31.394 --> 19:33.061
Under michelangelo's nose.

19:33.467 --> 19:34.436
leonardo:
they must have

19:34.793 --> 19:36.203
some kind of getaway
craft down there.

19:36.203 --> 19:37.522
let's move !

19:41.500 --> 19:44.668
No place left to run,
Shredder. You're trapped.

19:45.137 --> 19:49.222
on the contrary, my
aggressive amphibians.

19:49.473 --> 19:51.270
<i>you're the ones
who are trapped.</i>

19:51.519 --> 19:52.723
attack !

19:52.998 --> 19:54.816
Let's kick some shell !

20:01.301 --> 20:02.515
oh, no, not again !

20:04.947 --> 20:07.290
say bye-bye,
shell-back.

20:08.645 --> 20:11.959
no fair !

20:13.331 --> 20:15.197
Give us the medi-laser,
Shredder.

20:15.541 --> 20:17.605
an excellent suggestion.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.330
Back at you,
Shredder.

20:25.951 --> 20:27.912
the medi-laser !
grab it !

20:28.269 --> 20:29.838
No problem-o.

20:30.456 --> 20:32.503
no !

20:33.017 --> 20:34.665
i'll be back !

20:35.055 --> 20:37.028
Nice save,
Michelangelo.

20:37.353 --> 20:39.142
Hey, let's get back
To master splinter

20:39.350 --> 20:40.581
On the double.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.213
ok, i've set it
on healing frequency.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.952
here goes.

20:51.342 --> 20:52.481
turtles.

20:52.953 --> 20:53.948
april.

20:54.290 --> 20:55.465
what has happened ?

20:55.807 --> 20:57.318
We'll tell you
Later.

20:57.552 --> 20:59.350
<i>welcome back,
sensei.</i>

20:59.815 --> 21:01.232
i'll return this
to the hospital

21:01.232 --> 21:03.026
on my way back
to file the story.

21:03.323 --> 21:06.879
meanwhile, i hope you
learned a lesson from this.

21:07.149 --> 21:10.006
We did, april.
One can never relax

21:10.006 --> 21:12.235
In the battle
Against evil.

21:12.235 --> 21:16.229
Yeah. Also,
one can't eat 12 pizzas

21:16.448 --> 21:18.598
without regretting it the next day.

21:19.181 --> 21:25.116
Shredder, you bungling idiot !

21:25.806 --> 21:30.344
I should have known better
than to listen to you.

21:30.779 --> 21:31.684
And another thing...

21:31.684 --> 21:32.626
Wait.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.044
What are you doing ?

21:34.044 --> 21:35.070
Stop !

21:35.584 --> 21:38.735
Sometimes I don't know
who I detest more...

21:38.735 --> 21:41.777
the turtles or you !
