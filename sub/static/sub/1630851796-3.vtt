WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.916
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:24.666 --> 00:26.625
WHEN ARE WE HAVING DINNER?

00:37.958 --> 00:40.000
Are you with us, Doni?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.708
Yeah. Sounds great. Whose song is that?

00:42.791 --> 00:46.000
It could be yours.
It's called "Who Can Take It?"

00:46.083 --> 00:48.875
I'm trying a collab with you
and Theo Ribeiro.

00:48.958 --> 00:50.041
What do you think?

00:51.041 --> 00:53.083
But Theo Ribeiro is an influencer.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.708
He does everything.

00:54.791 --> 00:56.250
What about Kevinho?

00:56.333 --> 00:58.166
Everything in its own time.

00:58.666 --> 01:00.583
Marcão, isn't the song great?

01:00.666 --> 01:02.000
Great. It's a hit.

01:04.708 --> 01:06.250
Check this out.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.666
Great marketing.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.666
Damn. He's a poster boy for many brands.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.541
You can get a sponsor too.

01:13.625 --> 01:16.375
He's one of the greatest
Tik-Tokers in Brazil.

01:16.458 --> 01:18.833
A collab with him will be a hit.

01:18.916 --> 01:20.458
Everyone wins.

01:20.541 --> 01:22.791
This one will top the charts.

01:26.625 --> 01:29.250
I have a song. It's almost ready.

01:29.333 --> 01:33.041
Doni, you're very talented.
But it's a partnership,

01:33.125 --> 01:34.500
not a competition.

01:34.583 --> 01:36.875
You don't need to fight each other.

01:36.958 --> 01:39.041
It's to showcase both of you.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.875
I know, but it's almost done.

01:41.791 --> 01:43.125
I'll bring it this week.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.750
Alright. I trust you.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.333
Deal.

01:55.291 --> 01:57.875
I'm fucked, man. I've got no song.

01:57.958 --> 02:00.875
You're unbelievable. Fuck.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.833
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL IDEA
BY KONDZILLA

02:07.916 --> 02:11.208
It'll be very roomy.
One row here, another one there.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.541
It'll be great, Pastor.

02:14.041 --> 02:16.041
I can see the church already.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.625
All the blessings.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.375
All the anointing, Pastor.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.500
Beautiful! Thank God!

02:23.583 --> 02:25.791
I'm seeing things I didn't before.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.291
Water damage, Rita!

02:27.375 --> 02:29.958
Pastor, problems can be fixed.

02:30.041 --> 02:33.208
Look at this church.
It's important to the community.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.208
I'd be lost without it.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.208
I hope we don't take five years

02:37.291 --> 02:39.083
to finish the remodel.

02:39.166 --> 02:43.166
Pastor, don't forget
you're talking to a true grinder.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.666
Doing God's work.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.875
I got approval from the city
and the head pastors.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.791
Now, the hardest part. Donations.

02:58.708 --> 02:59.958
Hey, brother.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.333
All cool?

03:01.416 --> 03:04.583
-What's with the bike?
-It's hard work.

03:04.666 --> 03:07.333
-He's here.
-The boss has arrived.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.708
How's it going, man?

03:12.791 --> 03:14.250
-You cool?
-What's up?

03:14.333 --> 03:16.375
-All good?
-Great.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.000
-Hey.
-What's up?

03:18.083 --> 03:20.833
Man, we sold almost half of the load.

03:20.916 --> 03:23.750
-It's going great.
-It's flowing, man.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.708
The mix is really working!

03:25.791 --> 03:29.208
We're very busy.
I think I'm hiring another person.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.166
Great, man.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.375
-You're the manager now.
-You got it.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.583
Bro, I did the math.

03:34.666 --> 03:36.791
If we buy and mix more,

03:36.875 --> 03:38.416
the profits will double.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.250
-Great, man.
-We'll be cool.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.166
I don't know if I can get it.

03:44.875 --> 03:46.916
Help us out, man.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.250
-We need you.
-Trust us.

03:48.750 --> 03:52.750
I will try to get a discount
with half upfront

03:53.250 --> 03:54.708
and pay the rest later.

03:55.416 --> 03:58.125
If we do that, can we pay in three months?

03:58.208 --> 04:00.916
So, based on my numbers…

04:03.916 --> 04:04.750
That's right.

04:04.833 --> 04:08.083
We'll pay it off in three months
with extra to spare.

04:08.166 --> 04:10.708
Trust me. It'll work.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.375
Good fucking recruiting, man.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.000
-He's a beast, huh?
-Awesome.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.250
I'll talk to Messinho.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.250
You got a deal.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.166
-Cool.
-Help us out.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.083
Alright.

04:23.166 --> 04:26.458
Gotta get the numbers right, man.

04:31.708 --> 04:35.458
She loves me and tries to control me

04:35.541 --> 04:38.458
Rivaldo, it's golden.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.583
I'm getting emotional.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.958
What are the boys going to do?

04:44.458 --> 04:48.375
Everyone from all sides
want to get a haircut from us.

04:48.458 --> 04:51.416
Shit is going to get real.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.375
What a crazy girl
Keeps trying to control me

04:55.458 --> 04:57.291
Then she walks away

04:57.375 --> 04:59.375
She walks away

04:59.458 --> 05:01.666
It's imported, man.

05:02.583 --> 05:06.458
This girl is annoying
She's always complaining

05:06.541 --> 05:08.458
Then she walks away

05:08.541 --> 05:10.583
She walks away

05:10.666 --> 05:12.458
Am I on the right path?

05:13.291 --> 05:15.916
Yeah, you totally are.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.666
And what about Theo?

05:22.958 --> 05:24.666
What? Theo Ribeiro?

05:25.333 --> 05:28.083
-You know him?
-He's got pictures with Neymar.

05:28.166 --> 05:30.625
Theozinho? No way!

05:30.708 --> 05:34.833
Man, the guy's a great fucking singer.

05:34.916 --> 05:36.625
And he's got presence.

05:36.708 --> 05:37.875
Show him.

05:40.291 --> 05:41.875
The guy's cool.

05:41.958 --> 05:45.250
I know a guy who works for him,
says he's cool.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.750
Very generous.

05:46.833 --> 05:50.791
But he's not a musician.
He's a TikToker. Get it?

05:52.958 --> 05:55.125
We could send him some clothes.

05:56.291 --> 05:57.541
What, man?

05:57.625 --> 06:00.041
Stop kissing his butt and let me write.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.875
Then she walks away

06:07.166 --> 06:08.833
No, wait.

06:08.916 --> 06:11.416
It's better if we turn it around.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.791
To get everything.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.541
Wow.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.791
You're a jack-of-all-trades, Rita.

06:19.083 --> 06:19.958
It's great.

06:20.666 --> 06:22.625
It's so great to see this moving along.

06:23.666 --> 06:24.500
Yeah.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.083
And speaking of which,

06:29.041 --> 06:33.041
you really think your father
wouldn't help the church?

06:35.458 --> 06:36.458
I don't know, Rita.

06:36.958 --> 06:40.083
I know my father.
I can imagine what he'll say.

06:40.583 --> 06:43.125
"Honey, I know it's for a noble cause,

06:43.208 --> 06:45.958
but we're already paying
the church's rent."

06:46.541 --> 06:50.125
"Do you know how many congregations
can't pay their bills?"

06:52.041 --> 06:53.583
What if I talk to him?

06:54.333 --> 06:55.333
Levi?

06:55.875 --> 06:57.208
Come down here, please.

06:58.375 --> 07:01.875
-You okay?
-We need more food. There's a lot to do.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.750
The donor owns the market.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.333
He told me we could call him.

07:06.416 --> 07:07.833
-I got it.
-Thanks.

07:08.416 --> 07:11.916
Levi, what if I contacted
the large donors directly

07:12.000 --> 07:13.916
about remodeling the church?

07:15.833 --> 07:17.291
God's really using you.

07:31.791 --> 07:32.750
Thanks, bud.

07:43.291 --> 07:46.416
Hey, Nando. All good?
I need to talk to you.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.416
All's good with me.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.875
Tell me what you need.

07:51.916 --> 07:55.416
It's about a song. I need your help.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.333
Do you have time now?

07:58.166 --> 08:02.000
I'm a bit busy, man. But sing it to me.

08:03.666 --> 08:05.666
Alright, I only got the chorus.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.458
She says she trusts me
But always with suspicion

08:09.541 --> 08:11.291
Then she walks away

08:11.375 --> 08:13.416
Then she walks away

08:13.500 --> 08:17.125
Possessive woman
She's always complaining

08:17.208 --> 08:18.791
Then she walks away

08:18.875 --> 08:20.875
Then she walks away

08:20.958 --> 08:22.458
What do you think?

08:22.541 --> 08:25.708
To be honest,
the melody is great, but the lyrics…

08:25.791 --> 08:28.041
It's not you, man. For real.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.166
I'm fucked. I need to submit something.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.125
I want them to believe in me.

08:33.833 --> 08:37.208
Bro, everyone believes in your potential.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.750
Do your own thing. It'll be fine.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.083
I'm kind of busy,

08:42.166 --> 08:44.375
but I'll call you when I'm done.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.125
Later, man.

08:58.708 --> 09:00.708
-Sup, Nando.
-Sup, bro.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.875
-All good?
-Good.

09:02.958 --> 09:05.291
How's the shop and the family?

09:05.375 --> 09:08.333
-All good, brother.
-What do you need?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.666
I have a proposal for you.

09:11.166 --> 09:14.416
Your product is great.
It sold like hot cakes.

09:14.916 --> 09:17.500
-I was crunching the numbers--
-Relax, man.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.875
Let me order a drink. Hey.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.416
Gin and tonic, please.

09:30.416 --> 09:32.500
What does Badá want now?

09:32.583 --> 09:34.166
He didn't send me today.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.458
I came on my own.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.833
That shop is mine now.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.000
Shoot.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.541
Business is great.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.666
We'll double the revenue soon.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.333
I want twice as much this time.

09:49.416 --> 09:52.041
I'll pay half now and the rest in a month.

09:53.416 --> 09:54.416
Deal?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.750
Let me ask you something.

10:00.916 --> 10:02.333
How big is your business?

10:02.875 --> 10:03.916
Just the shop.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.416
I'll give you some advice.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.416
Free of charge.

10:12.375 --> 10:13.875
Diversify it.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.458
Understand?

10:15.958 --> 10:17.125
Open a…

10:17.833 --> 10:19.625
restaurant,

10:20.166 --> 10:21.708
a nightclub.

10:22.375 --> 10:25.458
Open a gas station, a car wash,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.250
a hotel, something like that.

10:28.416 --> 10:30.458
How much does a gin and tonic cost?

10:31.375 --> 10:33.875
The gin, the tonic, the bartender…

10:34.708 --> 10:37.166
How much for the entertainment,

10:37.250 --> 10:38.416
the singers?

10:42.166 --> 10:43.833
As much as I want.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.625
It costs what the owner decides.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.458
I understand, bro.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.875
Like hotel tariffs and things like that.

10:52.958 --> 10:54.208
Exactly.

10:55.041 --> 10:56.500
You gotta diversify.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.666
But I was thinking and it's legit.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.583
If you give me some time to pay,

11:03.666 --> 11:05.500
you'll get the money, trust me.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.375
I made an exception for Badá.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.416
I can't do that for everyone.

11:15.625 --> 11:16.458
It's business.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.458
Think about what I said.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.708
Don't settle for just one little shop.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.458
But I'll help you.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.333
What I can do with the load

11:31.208 --> 11:34.500
is half upfront, half when you pay it off.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.625
Alright?

11:41.416 --> 11:42.708
Thanks, bro.

11:45.208 --> 11:46.583
I appreciate your trust.

11:51.458 --> 11:55.375
What a crazy girl
Keeps trying to control me

11:55.458 --> 11:57.375
Then she walks away

11:59.583 --> 12:01.833
-What?
-It's horrible.

12:01.916 --> 12:02.833
What's wrong?

12:04.750 --> 12:05.666
Nothing.

12:07.291 --> 12:11.000
This girl is annoying
She's always complaining

12:11.083 --> 12:13.125
Then she walks away

12:13.208 --> 12:14.958
She walks away…

12:22.750 --> 12:23.916
Hey, guys.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.791
I'm sorry if I was rude.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.083
I was tense.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.666
Do you want to tell me something?

12:33.083 --> 12:34.541
We have a cousin.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.875
That again?

12:36.958 --> 12:38.833
Yeah, man.

12:38.916 --> 12:40.666
A very cool cousin.

12:41.166 --> 12:44.750
We've been meaning to show you her music.

12:44.833 --> 12:47.125
I think that it's time, you know?

12:47.208 --> 12:48.916
But she's a bit touchy.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
She's insolent, Jaspion.

12:51.583 --> 12:52.500
Bold.

12:53.666 --> 12:56.833
The girl likes attention
and you want her here?

12:56.916 --> 12:59.083
I didn't say that. Her name's Luzia.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.000
-MC Luzi now.
-She's cool.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.500
Can I hear her music?

13:05.583 --> 13:08.041
Sure, of course. Here.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.458
Hear this.

13:13.541 --> 13:15.541
It's finally Friday

13:15.625 --> 13:18.916
I'm all ready to go out

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
It's cool!

13:20.083 --> 13:22.291
Saying stupid things

13:22.375 --> 13:24.666
Thinking you're the boss of me

13:25.708 --> 13:27.833
-Awesome.
-She wrote it.

13:27.916 --> 13:29.916
The beat's hers too.

13:33.666 --> 13:35.041
Hey, Luzi. It's Doni.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.458
Come over. Let's talk.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.083
You're crazy, man.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.250
-Hey, sister.
-Hey.

14:02.916 --> 14:03.833
How are you?

14:05.708 --> 14:08.041
Let's visit Mr. Leonel.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.125
He sells gutters in Santana.

14:10.208 --> 14:12.083
My gut tells me he'll help.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.583
Levi with his jokes.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.208
Sorry.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.416
Alright, let's go.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.541
-Let's.
-Yep.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.666
When are we having another cheeseburger?

14:20.750 --> 14:22.708
-You really liked it.
-I did.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.708
I was thinking,

14:24.791 --> 14:27.333
I need more gospel playlists.

14:27.416 --> 14:30.375
-Maybe rap, international songs.
-I have many.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.541
Really? Can you share them?

14:32.625 --> 14:35.458
-Awesome.
-We don't play them during service.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.166
I forgot. Eliseu and Raquel
are coming too.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.250
Okay.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.583
Hello, Eliseu. Hey, Raquel.

14:43.666 --> 14:46.875
We're here to watch today.
You are the leaders.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.083
My God, that's a big responsibility.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.041
And we have high expectations.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.958
-Shall we go?
-Let's.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.708
-The boy's flying.
-Man, he even bought an X5.

15:10.791 --> 15:12.916
Really? Fuck.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
He's flying.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.625
Open that.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.083
This?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.083
-What's this?
-A gift, fucker.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.666
-No way, man.
-Yeah, it's for you.

15:36.750 --> 15:39.541
-You didn't have to.
-You'll have your own shop.

15:40.708 --> 15:41.875
We're climbing.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.125
This is just the beginning.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.166
Like it?

15:50.333 --> 15:52.708
-Thanks, bro.
-I got your back, man.

16:03.916 --> 16:05.916
-You're losing it.
-You suck, man.

16:06.416 --> 16:08.375
-Another one?
-Forget it, Rivaldo.

16:10.166 --> 16:12.375
-Make the turn.
-Stop it, man.

16:14.583 --> 16:16.583
-She's here.
-Yeah, she's here.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.500
Sup, guys?

16:25.041 --> 16:26.708
-Missed you, bro.
-Cousin!

16:26.791 --> 16:28.500
Word. Excuse me.

16:28.583 --> 16:29.416
Hey.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.333
Hey, man.

16:31.416 --> 16:34.791
I was so glad you called me.
I'm a huge fan.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.708
-Cool.
-Thanks.

16:36.791 --> 16:39.625
-Won't you talk to me?
-I didn't want to.

16:39.708 --> 16:43.250
Cool? Fuck, do it right.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.458
All good?

16:44.541 --> 16:45.375
Fuck!

16:47.708 --> 16:51.166
You really made it, man.
Your place is awesome.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.666
It's huge.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.958
-Do you like it?
-What? Amazing!

16:55.041 --> 16:57.750
I heard your songs. Your stuff's great.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.375
I knew you'd like them.
I have many others.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.166
I'm always writing.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.750
Me too, but the game changes.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.541
I need new partnerships.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.333
So I thought about you.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.500
Awesome. Thanks, man.

17:12.583 --> 17:13.750
It's on.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.416
But, brother…

17:16.166 --> 17:18.875
Listen, brother,

17:19.375 --> 17:20.583
it's hard to get here.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.125
I took a bus, a train, and had to walk.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.541
-It's far.
-No worries.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.583
Do you have anything to drink?

17:28.291 --> 17:30.250
-Sure.
-Just to cool down.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.416
-Wet my whistle.
-I got water, soda…

17:33.375 --> 17:35.333
A shot of the green one?

17:38.208 --> 17:39.041
Alright.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.875
-Coconut water ice?
-Yep.

17:40.958 --> 17:43.833
Alright, excuse me. I'll get it.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.625
What about your contact
who'd discover the rats?

17:54.250 --> 17:57.125
Do you know who ratted us out?

17:57.208 --> 17:58.125
No, man.

17:58.208 --> 18:01.541
Don't worry. When I get him,
I'll crush him myself.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.916
Man, I already told you.
You can't mess up.

18:05.458 --> 18:08.333
When you get him, fuck him up.

18:08.416 --> 18:10.625
-Yeah, man. No talk.
-That's right.

18:10.708 --> 18:12.500
I hope so.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.666
Bro, I wanted to talk to you.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.583
-What's up?
-Talk to Messinho.

18:18.666 --> 18:21.958
I made him a proposal,
but he was suspicious.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.708
Man, Messinho is complicated.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.208
He's always suspicious.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.791
He's always on the lookout,
never lets his guard down.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.958
-I'm good for it.
-I know, man.

18:33.041 --> 18:36.875
You see him just hanging out.
He seems to be chill.

18:36.958 --> 18:39.000
But in reality, he don't play.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.791
Understand, bro? He don't play.

18:42.416 --> 18:43.250
Right.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.125
I owe you one.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.208
No, man. You'll owe him one.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.916
I'm just his partner.

18:51.416 --> 18:54.708
If you fuck with him, we're dead.

18:54.791 --> 18:57.541
So do what's right.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.208
That's the way we roll.

18:59.291 --> 19:03.375
But I trust you. That's why I'm here.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.541
Get it?

19:04.625 --> 19:05.666
That's all.

19:22.958 --> 19:26.083
BUILDING SUPPLIES

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Last stop, Josué.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
I'm hungry.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.500
We'll get something to eat.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.208
-Sure.
-God bless.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.000
-Amen.
-God bless.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.083
Thank you.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.041
Josué is a huge donor.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.666
He's got many other stores.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.416
He's a friend of the family.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.750
"I've known this boy
since he was this big."

19:51.791 --> 19:53.041
-Hello.
-Hello.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.666
Good afternoon.

19:55.166 --> 19:58.083
You don't know him,
but my impression was spot on.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.291
I'm a little nervous.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.083
C'mon, Rita.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.916
We got the wires,
the tiles, and the glass.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.458
We just need the paint.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.000
I don't know.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.041
You've done so much.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.333
You're great at this.

20:15.833 --> 20:16.958
You can do it.

20:18.291 --> 20:21.041
-We're already here, right?
-Praise the Lord.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.833
-Praise be.
-Have faith.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.250
Levi, come in!

20:24.333 --> 20:25.750
-Thank you.
-Have a seat.

20:29.416 --> 20:32.041
When I met this boy, he was this big.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.416
Same age as my niece.

20:34.958 --> 20:37.083
-He'll be the mayor.
-Really?

20:37.166 --> 20:39.541
I said to Leopoldo when he was a kid,

20:39.625 --> 20:41.458
"The boy was chosen by God."

20:42.041 --> 20:45.125
Josué, Rita is from the congregation.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.875
Vila Áurea doesn't have a church.

20:47.958 --> 20:52.958
Headquarters is helping with rent,
but, you know, remodeling is tough.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.833
That takes a long time.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.958
But it'll soon be ready.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.125
God's in charge.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.333
We already have many donations.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.333
But we don't have the paint.

21:05.125 --> 21:09.125
I remember my first tithe,
when I opened my business.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.333
According to Pastor Leopoldo,

21:11.875 --> 21:15.375
it helped gather a new congregation

21:15.458 --> 21:17.458
in a very poor neighborhood

21:17.541 --> 21:20.291
and saved many lost souls.

21:20.791 --> 21:22.750
Your cause is a noble one.

21:22.833 --> 21:27.208
But I already give money to headquarters

21:27.291 --> 21:31.416
and initiatives in the places
I have a shop, so…

21:32.875 --> 21:35.333
I understand, Mr. Josué.

21:35.875 --> 21:39.875
But I'm thinking about what you said
and why we are here today.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.458
I want to show you something.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.083
I grew up in that church.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.208
I can't say when it opened.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.416
But I know for a fact

21:56.916 --> 21:58.958
it was thanks to men like you

21:59.041 --> 22:02.625
that I had a place to be
with my family and friends.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.291
Remember how it felt

22:05.000 --> 22:09.500
when your hard-earned money
helped bring more souls to Jesus?

22:10.916 --> 22:14.958
That's how I and my brethren
in Vila Áurea will feel

22:15.041 --> 22:17.750
when we reopen our church

22:17.833 --> 22:19.916
and spread the word of God.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.041
It left an impression on me

22:23.875 --> 22:25.375
to see families together.

22:26.208 --> 22:31.375
To see how those parents
and kids were happy.

22:32.666 --> 22:35.125
I see that in your face today.

22:36.708 --> 22:39.291
Your parents did a great job, Rita.

22:41.041 --> 22:42.000
I'll help you.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.708
Praise the Lord, Mr. Josué.

22:43.791 --> 22:46.333
Let's have a beautiful service

22:46.416 --> 22:49.333
to show that God's blessing the church.

22:49.416 --> 22:50.458
Absolutely!

22:51.500 --> 22:52.833
Thank you, Mr. Josué.

22:52.916 --> 22:54.583
You started off quiet.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.666
I was just getting ready.

22:57.333 --> 22:59.208
You really got him.

22:59.708 --> 23:03.291
Everyone needs something,
even if you have everything.

23:03.375 --> 23:06.083
-A natural-born politician.
-I know, thanks.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.625
Congratulations.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.000
Now we must think of the opening service.

23:11.083 --> 23:14.208
Yeah, now you must think
of the opening service, Rita.

23:15.583 --> 23:17.041
I'll help you, okay?

23:17.583 --> 23:21.250
It'll be the most beautiful service
in the history of the Vila.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.083
Yeah? A promise is a promise.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.750
-Barbecue, anyone?
-No, thanks.

23:25.833 --> 23:26.791
Thanks, Eliseu.

23:31.375 --> 23:35.208
Jaspion, it's just a touch-up.
Don't get too creative.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.375
I know what I'm doing, man.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.666
Many years cutting hair.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.083
-I know what I'm doing.
-Damn.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.791
Awesome trimmer. Cool.

23:44.875 --> 23:46.625
-Golden, yeah!
-Golden.

23:46.708 --> 23:49.708
Cousin, we only buy imported shit.

23:49.791 --> 23:52.208
By the way, you guys could sponsor me.

23:52.291 --> 23:55.458
-Send me some stuff.
-Sure, I'll get you some stuff.

23:55.541 --> 23:57.875
-Post it on Instagram.
-Sure.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.791
Hang on, I got the chorus.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.000
It goes like this.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.500
She says she trusts
But she's always suspicious

24:06.583 --> 24:08.291
Then she walks away

24:08.375 --> 24:10.291
Then she walks away

24:10.375 --> 24:14.125
A possessive woman is not in my plans

24:14.208 --> 24:15.750
So walk away

24:15.833 --> 24:17.916
So walk away

24:20.166 --> 24:22.083
I like it. It's cool.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.000
But you need more.

24:31.291 --> 24:33.750
I'm kidding, man. Carry on.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.208
From the top.

24:35.291 --> 24:38.875
She says she trusts
But she's always suspicious

24:38.958 --> 24:41.000
Then she walks away

24:41.083 --> 24:42.583
Then she walks away

24:42.666 --> 24:46.416
A possessive woman is not in my plans

24:46.500 --> 24:48.041
So walk away

24:48.125 --> 24:49.958
So walk away

24:50.041 --> 24:51.375
Grab her and say that--

24:51.458 --> 24:53.083
No, I go on.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.875
-From that part.
-Sorry, man. Carry on.

24:55.958 --> 24:59.333
We can't work out with that much jealousy

24:59.416 --> 25:01.083
There you go again

25:01.166 --> 25:02.958
You're a real pain

25:03.041 --> 25:04.166
I think that's it.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.375
-That's all?
-It is.

25:11.875 --> 25:15.541
Man, you should be jumping.
Where's your enthusiasm?

25:15.625 --> 25:16.791
You're MC Doni.

25:16.875 --> 25:18.916
Cousin, give me that glass.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.708
-Give me some.
-Don't drink all of it.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.833
Something's missing.

25:23.916 --> 25:27.333
Man, didn't you say
you were submitting the song today?

25:27.416 --> 25:28.625
That's it, man.

25:29.208 --> 25:32.916
Call Marcão
Tell him it's ready

25:33.000 --> 25:34.958
Then you walk away

25:35.041 --> 25:38.250
Call Marcão
Tell him it's ready

25:42.166 --> 25:44.625
Guys! Family!

25:45.083 --> 25:46.333
Hey, guys!

25:46.416 --> 25:49.500
Seriously, we should do another song.

25:49.583 --> 25:52.625
Come up with something else.
I didn't like this one.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.750
I don't need to carry it around, right?

26:03.833 --> 26:05.541
Everywhere I go.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.333
The shop's doing great.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.875
Your call.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.833
You're not a brother yet.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.875
Yeah, exactly.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.750
I'll be cool, away from trouble.

26:27.375 --> 26:29.625
That's right. It's up to you, man.

26:45.958 --> 26:49.208
I was thinking of more of a pop vibe.

26:49.291 --> 26:52.333
Not my thing, but it could work.
Got any ideas?

26:52.416 --> 26:55.125
I think we could do something like this…

26:55.208 --> 26:57.166
Called her over to the house

26:58.208 --> 26:59.291
To go at it no pause

26:59.375 --> 27:01.916
She gon' be working that booty up and down

27:03.208 --> 27:04.416
Can you repeat that?

27:04.916 --> 27:06.708
Called her over to the house.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.625
To go at it no pause.

27:08.708 --> 27:10.583
I think that in pop today,

27:10.666 --> 27:14.375
it's cool to add some stuff in English.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.250
Something bilingual.
Gotta think international.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.166
How?

27:18.250 --> 27:21.000
You can replace "casa" with "house"

27:21.875 --> 27:23.000
and say "pause."

27:23.083 --> 27:24.250
-Pause.
-It's cool.

27:24.916 --> 27:26.041
Try that.

27:26.125 --> 27:26.958
Like…

27:27.458 --> 27:29.250
Called her over to the house

27:29.333 --> 27:30.916
To go at it no pause

27:31.000 --> 27:33.375
She gon' be working that booty up and down

27:33.458 --> 27:35.833
Great. Again, so I can create something.

27:35.916 --> 27:37.500
Then you take it away.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.541
Called her over to the house

27:39.625 --> 27:40.791
To go at it no pause

27:40.875 --> 27:43.500
She gon' be working that booty up and down

27:43.583 --> 27:44.791
Just got my tan on

27:44.875 --> 27:46.125
Feeling frisky

27:46.208 --> 27:48.500
If we get together, we gon' go kaboom

27:48.583 --> 27:51.000
Fuck, man. I told you she's awesome.

27:51.083 --> 27:53.208
-What did you say?
-I said that.

27:53.291 --> 27:54.125
I did.

27:54.208 --> 27:56.875
Alright, you both said that.
Let us do our thing.

27:57.583 --> 27:58.541
"Kaboom," right?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.500
-Yeah.
-Let's get to the chorus.

28:00.583 --> 28:01.416
Great.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.791
She likes to scratch, to lick, and to kiss

28:04.875 --> 28:07.666
Her ass is deadly
Leaves me out of breath

28:07.750 --> 28:09.666
-Going up? Great.
-To the chorus.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.958
I begin to grind ya
I know how to tease ya

28:13.916 --> 28:15.500
I can't hold on anymore

28:15.583 --> 28:16.416
The chorus.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.166
It's too late to stop

28:18.750 --> 28:19.708
And you answer.

28:19.791 --> 28:21.583
She starts to scream

28:22.250 --> 28:24.041
This feels so good

28:24.125 --> 28:25.041
You answer.

28:25.125 --> 28:26.041
So good?

28:29.333 --> 28:30.541
So good…

28:31.750 --> 28:33.875
The neighbors will call the cops

28:35.041 --> 28:36.583
-Wow!
-That's amazing!

28:36.666 --> 28:38.458
Let's try it.

28:38.541 --> 28:39.750
Alright, you start.

28:39.833 --> 28:42.541
Called her over to the house
To go at it no pause

28:42.625 --> 28:45.083
She gon' be working that booty up and down

28:45.166 --> 28:47.500
Just got my tan on, feeling frisky

28:47.583 --> 28:50.083
If we get together, we gon' go kaboom

28:50.166 --> 28:52.333
She likes to scratch, to lick, and to kiss

28:52.416 --> 28:54.541
Her ass is deadly
Leaves me out of breath

28:55.125 --> 28:57.166
I begin to grind ya
I know how to tease ya

28:57.250 --> 28:58.791
I can't hold on anymore

28:58.875 --> 29:00.250
It's too late to stop

29:02.083 --> 29:02.958
Come on!

29:03.458 --> 29:05.375
She won't stop screaming

29:07.125 --> 29:08.416
Go.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.208
This feels so good

29:10.708 --> 29:12.833
You know what's next.

29:12.916 --> 29:14.916
The neighbors will call the cops

29:16.250 --> 29:19.083
FAMILY GROUP
GREAT SONG, BROTHER!

29:20.125 --> 29:22.708
Guys, I want to tell you something.

29:22.791 --> 29:24.916
God has blessed my day.

29:25.541 --> 29:27.250
And get ready.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.583
I'm going to help remodel the church!

29:29.666 --> 29:31.375
Our church, brethren!

29:31.458 --> 29:34.500
I'm really happy,
and I want to share it with you.

29:34.583 --> 29:35.958
Let's meet tomorrow.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.791
Rita! If you need help, I'm here for you.

29:48.375 --> 29:50.583
Let's do it, but I'm busy tomorrow.

29:50.666 --> 29:52.500
Maybe next week.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.583
We're always in a rush, man.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.625
I'm really proud of you all.

30:02.708 --> 30:05.708
Rita, call me when you guys set it up.

30:05.791 --> 30:08.625
I'm kind of busy,
but I can do next week, okay?

30:08.708 --> 30:10.958
Just hit me up. Love you guys.

30:13.708 --> 30:16.708
GIRL, WANNA HELP ME
TO REMODEL THE CHURCH?

30:17.333 --> 30:18.458
YES!!!!

30:19.375 --> 30:21.375
NEW MESSAGE

30:24.791 --> 30:26.333
Hey, Rita. It's Levi.

30:26.416 --> 30:29.250
I wanted to thank you for today.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.250
It was great to have you with us.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.625
I know how to tease ya

30:36.708 --> 30:38.375
I can't hold on anymore

30:38.458 --> 30:40.000
It's too late to stop

30:43.375 --> 30:45.416
She won't stop screaming

30:48.125 --> 30:49.000
Stop it.

30:49.083 --> 30:50.416
This feels so good

30:55.666 --> 30:58.250
Holy fucking shit.

31:03.041 --> 31:05.291
Awesome song, Doni.

31:05.375 --> 31:06.333
Like it, Luan?

31:06.916 --> 31:08.875
I wrote it with Luzi.

31:08.958 --> 31:10.750
She's great. Right, Marcão?

31:10.833 --> 31:11.791
Fuck.

31:11.875 --> 31:14.916
Ágata, find out if this MC Luzi

31:15.000 --> 31:18.041
has a manager,
so we can discuss copyright, okay?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.666
One second.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.833
Call Portiolli's staff.

31:22.916 --> 31:25.958
Try and get us a spot for Doni.

31:26.625 --> 31:27.666
Yeah, man!

31:28.250 --> 31:30.166
Kick ass on that show.

31:34.208 --> 31:35.416
She's got talent.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.791
Luan, I need to speak with you.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.208
Tainá, I'm almost done here.

31:40.291 --> 31:42.250
Fifteen more minutes.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.666
Okay.

31:45.583 --> 31:47.416
Just one more thing.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.875
The more you try, the more you get it.

31:49.958 --> 31:54.041
Theo Ribeiro is a great guy.
He'd be good for you.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.791
Think about it carefully.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.333
Alright. Done.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.083
Good job, boy. You did great.

32:01.166 --> 32:02.125
Cool.

32:03.583 --> 32:06.916
Hey, Luzi. Get ready
'cause we'll be on TV.

32:50.791 --> 32:52.958
Fuck, the guy knows how to live.

32:53.041 --> 32:55.541
-He likes good things.
-Yeah.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.583
There he is.

33:02.083 --> 33:04.041
Let's go talk to him already.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.291
Yeah.

33:05.375 --> 33:06.291
Check this out.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.208
Fuck me, bro.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.041
Crazy shit. Don't be dragged into this.

33:26.375 --> 33:29.000
-What's up, partners?
-Hey, Caneta!

33:29.083 --> 33:31.208
-Sup, man?
-All good?

33:31.291 --> 33:32.458
Have a seat.

33:34.583 --> 33:37.083
Caneta, remember my nephew?

33:37.166 --> 33:40.125
Sure. The boy has grown, man.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.083
Fuck.

33:41.166 --> 33:43.125
How about this one, Uncle?

33:43.208 --> 33:44.500
It's sick.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.083
We're buying the boy a yacht.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.416
-Right?
-Cool.

33:48.500 --> 33:51.250
It's best to have
a friend who owns a yacht.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.958
That's why I'm your friend.

33:54.125 --> 33:55.208
Hilarious.

33:55.750 --> 33:56.875
Here.

33:56.958 --> 33:58.666
Alright, Messi.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.708
I have a proposal for you.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.291
I brought Nando.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.500
He wants to speak with you.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.875
Nando, ever been on a yacht?

34:11.166 --> 34:13.125
Not like that one.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.375
You're new at this.

34:14.875 --> 34:16.500
There's still time.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.458
We work our fucking asses off.

34:18.541 --> 34:20.875
We need to have some fucking fun, right?

34:20.958 --> 34:21.833
-Word.
-Yeah.

34:21.916 --> 34:24.541
-This one's sick.
-I want that one.

34:39.416 --> 34:41.291
-Hey, Nando! Everything--
-Fuck!

34:41.375 --> 34:43.875
-My bad, I was distracted.
-Watch it, boy.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.166
-Fuck!
-Sorry.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.375
Hey, playboy! You fucking with me?

35:02.958 --> 35:05.041
-You okay?
-I'm good.

35:05.125 --> 35:07.625
Cool. What a fucker.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.958
Brother, it's the same amount
I got from Badá.

35:11.041 --> 35:12.875
But I'll pay half in cash

35:12.958 --> 35:15.250
and the rest in three months.

35:15.333 --> 35:18.208
I'll pay the next shipment in cash.

35:18.291 --> 35:20.791
Get it? I'll do that monthly.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.000
You can trust me, brother.

35:28.833 --> 35:29.791
Every month.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.250
Our word is worth gold, brother.

35:38.333 --> 35:39.291
That's right.

35:40.291 --> 35:41.125
Hey,

35:41.958 --> 35:43.708
what happened over there?

35:44.500 --> 35:46.291
Some stupid shit.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.333
I politely asked him to leave.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.875
I'll introduce you
to some friends of mine.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.041
You've got to diversify it.

36:46.875 --> 36:47.875
Hey.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.500
How are you?

36:49.583 --> 36:50.708
Woke up early?

36:52.375 --> 36:54.583
I almost took your daughter
to the hospital.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.291
She was burning up.

36:56.375 --> 36:58.083
Do you need anything?

36:59.166 --> 37:00.250
I got the sitter.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.500
Is she feeling better now?

37:02.583 --> 37:05.791
She's fine now. Her fever broke.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.708
If you need anything, just ask.

37:20.750 --> 37:26.125
I'M VISITING OUR BOAT.
YOU'RE INVITED.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.000
Take a shower, Luiz Fernando.

37:40.416 --> 37:42.500
THANKS, BUT TONIGHT

37:42.583 --> 37:45.333
I NEED TO BE WITH MY PEOPLE

37:50.416 --> 37:54.875
ONLY FAIR. TAKE YOUR FAMILY
TO OUR RESTAURANT.

38:12.625 --> 38:15.916
Rita, why with my eyes closed?
What are you up to?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.875
Relax, Pastor. Watch the step.

38:18.416 --> 38:20.833
I talked to Mr. Joaquim and Freitas.

38:20.916 --> 38:22.833
Everyone wants to help.

38:22.916 --> 38:25.375
That's great, Pastor. Watch the step.

38:25.458 --> 38:29.333
Now it's the hardest part.
Building materials and money.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.208
Alright, Pastor.

38:32.041 --> 38:33.208
Open your eyes.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.833
Holy Father!

38:38.041 --> 38:39.416
What a blessing, Rita!

38:39.916 --> 38:42.833
Blessed be thy name, Jesus!

38:42.916 --> 38:46.041
-Thank you, Lord. Thanks, honey.
-My pleasure, Pastor.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.875
We won't take five years.

38:49.958 --> 38:52.041
-Of course not!
-No way.

38:52.125 --> 38:54.833
Soon, we'll be praying in a new temple.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.583
Amen, Pastor.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.416
STAFF

39:05.208 --> 39:07.000
-Hey, Marcão!
-Hey, man.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.125
Did you get the green apples?

39:09.750 --> 39:11.375
Man, I forgot.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.791
Green apples, Marcão.

39:13.875 --> 39:16.000
Can't forget the green apples.

39:16.625 --> 39:19.083
Marcão, you screwed up.

39:19.166 --> 39:20.875
Red apples are unacceptable.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.291
He needs green apples for his throat.

39:23.375 --> 39:26.583
I've got a cousin who's a producer.
He needs a job.

39:28.916 --> 39:31.708
Fuck, I never know
when you're screwing with me.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.583
They'll always do that.

39:36.666 --> 39:37.875
Fuck you.

39:41.583 --> 39:44.791
Hey, Marcão. Did you get upset?
It was a joke, man.

39:44.875 --> 39:47.125
What? It's cool, man.

39:50.791 --> 39:52.166
Tally is coming--

39:53.791 --> 39:55.458
What's up, guys?

39:55.541 --> 39:57.041
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:57.125 --> 39:59.125
-Hey, Doni!
-How's it going?

39:59.208 --> 40:00.125
Great.

40:00.208 --> 40:02.166
Fixing the look for TV?

40:02.250 --> 40:03.708
I heard you were coming.

40:04.416 --> 40:06.208
Such bullshit.

40:06.916 --> 40:07.916
I love it.

40:08.666 --> 40:10.458
Came to do a live with me?

40:10.541 --> 40:12.916
I'll be the influencer attraction.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.458
I'll interview Theo Ribeiro.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.916
Really? That's cool.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.291
I gotta go.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.375
Alright.

40:25.250 --> 40:28.083
-Later. Call me.
-Okay.

40:29.416 --> 40:32.541
Doni, I look so good,
they didn't do my makeup.

40:33.208 --> 40:34.250
They didn't?

40:45.041 --> 40:46.541
Marcão, what's going on?

40:48.583 --> 40:50.375
Luzi can't perform.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.500
-What do you mean?
-She can't.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.291
Luan only booked you.

40:54.375 --> 40:55.666
It's her song too.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.833
Yeah, but she's not with Bang Loko.

40:57.916 --> 40:58.791
But she can be.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.583
Man, Luan tried.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.291
He talked to her manager,

41:02.375 --> 41:04.208
he tried to level with him,

41:04.291 --> 41:05.458
but he refused.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.458
That's what her manager wants,
but what about what she wants?

41:09.541 --> 41:11.416
This always happens.

41:11.500 --> 41:15.041
He thinks the money from the song
will make him rich.

41:15.541 --> 41:16.791
What an idiot.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.333
She'll perform. Fuck it.

41:19.416 --> 41:20.541
Calm down, man.

41:20.625 --> 41:22.750
This fight is not worth having.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.583
Business comes before the show.

41:26.291 --> 41:27.458
Calm down.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.333
Who'll tell her?

41:32.458 --> 41:34.375
That's a good question, Doni.

41:41.541 --> 41:44.583
I'll post this one.
We'll take another outside.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.000
Awesome beef, Nando.

41:51.791 --> 41:53.875
It's had a better life than we did.

42:06.333 --> 42:07.208
Hang on.

42:11.083 --> 42:13.250
Hey, brother. All good?

42:13.333 --> 42:15.208
All good, thank the Lord.

42:15.291 --> 42:17.541
-We cool?
-We cool, thank the Lord.

42:18.083 --> 42:19.791
What's up, brother?

42:20.791 --> 42:22.291
I heard you went to Messinho.

42:22.375 --> 42:25.000
That you made a deal. Is that right?

42:25.083 --> 42:27.375
That's right. Gotta keep the business.

42:27.875 --> 42:29.125
Alright, cool.

42:29.208 --> 42:30.166
And my shop?

42:31.208 --> 42:33.625
You forgot your godfather?

42:34.125 --> 42:36.416
No, brother! We're in this together.

42:36.500 --> 42:40.666
If we were, you'd have found
the rat that took our load.

42:42.416 --> 42:43.958
We had another one, right?

42:45.041 --> 42:46.250
Same as before.

42:46.750 --> 42:49.458
If you can't find out
who's ratting us out soon,

42:49.958 --> 42:51.916
you risk losing your own load.

42:53.125 --> 42:54.250
I'm on it, brother.

42:54.333 --> 42:56.708
Brother, do better.

42:56.791 --> 43:00.500
It's time. You're the one in charge.
So make this happen.

43:00.583 --> 43:01.625
You're right.

43:02.291 --> 43:04.458
Don't worry. I won't screw this up.

43:04.958 --> 43:05.916
Got it?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.250
We've got the same appetite. Trust me.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.375
Alright, boy.

43:09.458 --> 43:12.875
You got my respect.
God be with you. Later, man.

43:12.958 --> 43:15.041
Alright, man. Later.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.291
Enjoying the meal?

43:24.708 --> 43:26.250
For two now.

43:27.375 --> 43:28.375
Right.

43:28.875 --> 43:30.000
Don't worry.

43:30.083 --> 43:32.250
I'll help you promote your song.

43:32.333 --> 43:33.958
You guys will help too.

43:34.041 --> 43:35.291
-Yep.
-Yep.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.750
Doni, we're ready for you.

43:38.458 --> 43:40.541
Don't give up. It'll work out.

43:41.041 --> 43:42.291
Doni, one minute.

43:42.791 --> 43:43.625
Let's go.

43:44.125 --> 43:45.583
I'll say your name.

43:46.083 --> 43:47.708
-Alright?
-Cool.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.208
Come on.

44:04.083 --> 44:08.250
Alright, I have the pleasure
of welcoming a very talented MC.

44:08.333 --> 44:11.083
Singing his latest single,

44:11.166 --> 44:13.416
MC Doni!

44:14.083 --> 44:18.208
MC Luzi, our song is on TV!

44:18.291 --> 44:20.750
It's our song! Come on!

44:20.833 --> 44:21.666
It's ours.

44:22.166 --> 44:23.875
Called her over to the house

44:23.958 --> 44:25.458
To go at it no pause

44:25.541 --> 44:27.708
She gon' be working that booty up and down

44:27.791 --> 44:30.375
Just got my tan on, feeling frisky

44:30.458 --> 44:33.000
If we get together, we gon' go kaboom

44:33.083 --> 44:35.416
She likes to scratch, to lick, and to kiss

44:35.500 --> 44:37.833
Her ass is deadly
Leaves me out of breath

44:37.916 --> 44:40.250
I begin to grind ya
I know how to tease ya

44:40.333 --> 44:42.375
I can't hold on anymore

44:42.458 --> 44:43.666
It's too late to stop

44:47.166 --> 44:48.916
She won't stop screaming

44:49.000 --> 44:51.208
Alright, MC Luzi!

44:57.666 --> 44:59.083
Hey, how are you?

44:59.583 --> 45:01.250
Hello, sisters. How are you?

45:02.291 --> 45:03.208
Thanks.

45:03.875 --> 45:07.125
-Where are the prayers?
-We like music too.

45:07.208 --> 45:09.916
-I liked it.
-You did? It's gospel.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.791
Thought you weren't coming.

45:12.875 --> 45:15.958
-You said I'd be your right-hand lady.
-That's better.

45:16.041 --> 45:17.125
Let's get to it.

45:17.208 --> 45:19.666
Please carry these cans over there,

45:19.750 --> 45:20.958
my right-hand lady.

45:22.750 --> 45:25.541
Boys, can you get the things
from the truck?

45:25.625 --> 45:26.875
-Sure.
-Thanks.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.208
Rita, this is heavy!

45:29.708 --> 45:31.666
I won't need to go to the gym.

45:33.125 --> 45:35.000
How do you think I work out?

45:35.083 --> 45:36.208
I can see that.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.708
When were you gonna tell me
about that stud?

45:43.458 --> 45:45.083
Awesome car, honey.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.791
-Here, buddy.
-Thank you.

45:50.083 --> 45:51.416
-Did you like it?
-Yep.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.666
-You drive.
-Why?

45:54.416 --> 45:57.000
-It's yours now.
-Nando, are you serious?

45:57.083 --> 45:59.458
-I'm serious.
-Really, love? For real?

46:00.708 --> 46:02.291
It's so me.

46:02.875 --> 46:05.083
It's so fancy!

46:05.166 --> 46:06.666
Check this out!

46:07.833 --> 46:10.416
-Isn't it me?
-Get used to it.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.583
Get in, honey.

46:15.333 --> 46:17.041
It's so smooth!

46:18.458 --> 46:20.666
I love this new car smell.

46:23.958 --> 46:26.125
You know I'm here for you, right?

46:31.166 --> 46:33.708
If you need anything, count on me.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.333
Now with a brand-new car.

46:36.166 --> 46:37.583
She's so badass.

46:38.916 --> 46:41.750
-Awesome performance, man.
-Amazing, bro.

46:41.833 --> 46:43.541
People were screaming!

46:43.625 --> 46:44.541
Check this out.

46:46.041 --> 46:47.333
You did it, Doni!

46:47.875 --> 46:49.708
Nice to meet you. Theo Ribeiro.

46:49.791 --> 46:50.625
-Hey.
-Cool?

46:50.708 --> 46:51.750
Great music, man.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.791
-Let's do a collab.
-Deal.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.500
Give me a call. Bye, guys.

46:55.583 --> 46:56.750
-Cool.
-Later, Theo.

46:58.666 --> 47:02.041
Man, the guy was all over you.

47:02.666 --> 47:04.833
He nearly kissed your ass.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.333
Yo, dude, your performance is trending.

47:09.416 --> 47:11.000
You broke the Internet.

47:11.666 --> 47:14.083
It's blowing up.

47:14.166 --> 47:15.250
Where's Luzi?

47:15.750 --> 47:18.041
Talking to her manager outside.

47:22.916 --> 47:24.416
Fucking idiot.

47:25.625 --> 47:28.125
No. Not you, we're cool.

47:28.625 --> 47:30.041
It's these people.

47:30.125 --> 47:32.125
We're just a cog in the wheel.

47:32.208 --> 47:35.250
These managers only see dollar signs.

47:35.333 --> 47:37.000
They play with our dreams.

47:37.583 --> 47:39.708
So many talented people in the hood.

47:39.791 --> 47:42.583
And these leeches screw us over.

47:43.791 --> 47:44.875
It's fucked up.

47:50.583 --> 47:54.666
But believe in yourself.
You've got talent. Believe in your dream.

47:54.750 --> 47:57.666
-I know, but…
-Hang on.

47:58.833 --> 47:59.833
Hello?

47:59.916 --> 48:02.833
It was amazing, honey! Congratulations!

48:03.333 --> 48:04.541
Glad you liked it.

48:04.625 --> 48:05.583
I loved it!

48:05.666 --> 48:10.041
I'll make that steak you love
to celebrate.

48:10.125 --> 48:12.833
Alright, make plenty.
I'm bringing some friends over.

48:18.458 --> 48:19.458
Okay.

48:20.250 --> 48:23.291
I have to go now. I'll see you later.

48:23.916 --> 48:25.041
Everything okay?

48:25.875 --> 48:27.833
I've got customers. Bye, Son.

48:27.916 --> 48:31.833
Hello. I've come
for my bread rolls, Lucrécia.
