NARRATOR: <i>It was the day</i>
<i>of Barney and Robin's wedding,</i>

00:02.800 --> 00:05.080
<i>and a surprise guest</i>
<i>had just arrived.</i>

00:05.081 --> 00:07.548
ROBIN: <i>Mom, I-I can't believe</i>
<i>you're here.</i>

00:07.550 --> 00:08.616
How did you get here?

00:08.618 --> 00:10.017
On a plane.

00:10.019 --> 00:12.887
With your fear of flying?
What, did the plane drive here?

00:12.889 --> 00:15.623
(laughs)
I've made enormous strides

00:15.625 --> 00:17.658
since you last saw me, dear.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.627
This is nice.
(chuckles)

00:19.629 --> 00:21.629
I don't love flying,
I must admit.

00:21.631 --> 00:24.064
I haven't been on a
plane in years, but...

00:24.066 --> 00:25.733
maybe this won't
be such a bad...

00:25.735 --> 00:27.735
PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are cleared for takeoff.

00:27.737 --> 00:30.704
(screams)
We're all gonna die!

00:30.706 --> 00:32.640
We're all gonna die!

00:32.642 --> 00:33.874
(screaming)

00:33.876 --> 00:36.510
During the flight, I'll admit,

00:36.512 --> 00:39.246
I-I had a few...
difficult moments,

00:39.248 --> 00:40.314
but, you know,

00:40.316 --> 00:41.882
by the time we'd landed...

00:41.884 --> 00:43.450
Here already.

00:43.452 --> 00:47.721
Well, I have to say,
it wasn't so dreadful after all.

00:47.723 --> 00:51.025
Oh, I do apologize if
I caused any distress.

00:51.027 --> 00:54.228
And, oh, I'm terribly
sorry about the door.

00:54.230 --> 00:57.698
I had no idea it would
fly off like that.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.667
Please, please
send me a bill,

00:59.669 --> 01:01.969
because I'd like
to replace it.

01:03.038 --> 01:05.573
I'll be taking the train home.

Well, it's official:
I'm gonna be

01:24.235 --> 01:26.201
Judge Marshall Eriksen.

01:26.203 --> 01:28.003
That is great.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.239
Can you help me get
a driver's license?

01:30.241 --> 01:32.174
A what?

01:32.176 --> 01:33.508
Marshall, you, uh,
you don't sound

01:33.510 --> 01:34.943
too excited to
become a judge.

01:34.945 --> 01:36.745
(sighs) I feel
kind of guilty about it.

01:36.747 --> 01:39.414
I mean, I know how badly
Lily wanted to move to Italy.

01:39.416 --> 01:40.782
Don't do this, bro.

01:40.784 --> 01:42.217
Classic mistake.

01:42.219 --> 01:43.785
You won-- enjoy it.

01:43.787 --> 01:47.189
Drink the blood of your
vanquished enemy and move on.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.424
You're gonna be
a great husband.

01:49.426 --> 01:50.993
No, no, wait,
he has a point.

01:50.995 --> 01:52.928
I mean, you said yourself,
it was her decision.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.663
Lily chose to
give up her job

01:54.665 --> 01:56.932
and not move to Rome
so you could be a judge.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.233
Yeah, but something
seemed off.

01:58.235 --> 02:00.636
We had this big fight
and she stormed out,

02:00.638 --> 02:03.639
and when she came back, she had
totally, like, changed her mind.

02:03.641 --> 02:04.773
Wait, what time
was this?

02:04.775 --> 02:07.476
A little after 3:00 a.m.,
Billy Zabka. Why?

02:07.478 --> 02:08.776
Well, last night,
I was out

02:08.779 --> 02:10.245
doing some late-night
dirt-biking in the sand.

02:10.247 --> 02:11.813
Naturally. Continue.
And I ended up

02:11.815 --> 02:14.216
at that EZ Pick a few
miles up the road.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.684
And, well...

02:23.192 --> 02:24.793
That's odd.

02:24.795 --> 02:27.062
SEVERAL PEOPLE:
Boo...!

02:27.064 --> 02:29.865
You saw Lily
getting into someone's car?

02:29.867 --> 02:31.066
I wonder who it was.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.068
What did
the license plate say?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.503
It said...

02:34.505 --> 02:36.371
<i>"AHOY!!!"</i>

02:36.373 --> 02:38.807
The Captain!
Lily's boss.

02:38.809 --> 02:40.175
He has a house out here.

02:40.177 --> 02:42.411
Wait, why was Lily getting
into the Captain's car

02:42.413 --> 02:43.912
at 3:00 in the morning?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.914
Guys...

02:45.916 --> 02:49.551
I hate to even say this, but...

02:49.553 --> 02:52.254
do you think it's possible...

02:53.189 --> 02:55.457
...that I could eat
six of these saltines

02:55.459 --> 02:56.925
in under a minute?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.261
Challenge accepted!

03:00.163 --> 03:02.764
Well, I can't wait
to meet this Barney.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.033
I haven't met him
already, have I?

03:05.035 --> 03:07.102
Because they said
after getting Tasered,

03:07.104 --> 03:10.672
I might suffer from
short-term memory loss.

03:10.674 --> 03:12.174
Oh, you'd remember
if you'd met Barney.

03:12.176 --> 03:15.711
Why don't I see what
he's doing right now?

03:15.713 --> 03:16.812
(phone ringing)

03:16.814 --> 03:19.014
Barney's phone.
Ted, where's Barney?

03:19.016 --> 03:19.948
He's trying to eat

03:19.950 --> 03:21.550
six saltines in
under a minute.

03:21.552 --> 03:24.386
Well, his future
mother-in-law is here.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.721
Robin's mom is here.

03:26.856 --> 03:28.190
And she wants to meet him.

03:28.192 --> 03:29.424
She wants to meet you.

03:31.928 --> 03:34.496
He's kind of in the middle of a
saltine challenge at the moment.

03:36.265 --> 03:38.834
But as soon as he's done,
he'll just, uh, pop right over.

03:38.836 --> 03:40.235
All right. Good-bye.

03:40.237 --> 03:41.670
ROBIN:
The saltine challenge?

03:41.672 --> 03:43.038
Now?
(Lily chuckles)

03:43.040 --> 03:44.673
It's his wedding day.

03:44.675 --> 03:46.341
Guys do weird things
on their wedding day.

03:46.343 --> 03:47.642
Well, on my wedding day,

03:47.644 --> 03:49.778
Robin's father
completely disappeared

03:49.780 --> 03:51.279
for about three hours.

03:51.281 --> 03:52.614
He just said,
"I've got to go

03:52.616 --> 03:55.517
and teach somebody some
manners," and off he went.

03:55.519 --> 03:56.385
And then

03:56.387 --> 03:57.552
three hours later,

03:57.554 --> 04:00.288
he emerged from the
woods with a dead elk

04:00.290 --> 04:02.024
slung across his shoulder.

04:02.026 --> 04:06.495
And I didn't even know that
there <i>were</i> elk in Bermuda.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.429
But this Barney--

04:07.431 --> 04:09.931
he sounds like a fine young man.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.333
Yes, he is.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.402
We're going again.

04:14.470 --> 04:15.537
Marshall, are you okay?

04:15.539 --> 04:16.904
Why did she get into
the Captain's car,

04:16.906 --> 04:18.206
and why didn't she
tell me about it?

04:18.208 --> 04:19.975
Well, maybe it was a work thing.
What? No.

04:19.976 --> 04:21.276
She has a big
fight with me,

04:21.278 --> 04:22.611
she goes down
to an EZ Pick,

04:22.613 --> 04:23.845
she gets into
the Captain's Mercedes,

04:23.847 --> 04:24.946
and then three
hours later,

04:24.948 --> 04:26.548
she doesn't want to go
to Italy anymore?

04:26.550 --> 04:28.116
I mean, do you
think this means...

04:28.118 --> 04:30.285
That the Captain moored
his dinghy in Lily's lagoon?

04:30.287 --> 04:31.253
Most definitely.

04:31.255 --> 04:32.554
That's crazy.

04:32.556 --> 04:34.256
You'd never moor a
dinghy in a lagoon.

04:34.258 --> 04:35.223
I don't know, Ted.

04:35.225 --> 04:36.491
In certain
tidal conditions,

04:36.493 --> 04:37.659
if you had a
protected inlet...

04:37.661 --> 04:39.127
Okay, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

04:39.129 --> 04:40.695
Today is
Barney's wedding.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.664
Let's just forget it.

04:42.666 --> 04:45.000
Marshall...

04:45.002 --> 04:47.269
do you want to go over to
the Captain's house right now,

04:47.271 --> 04:48.603
punch him in the face
really fast

04:48.605 --> 04:50.705
and then come back
and do this wedding?

04:53.276 --> 04:54.743
Would that be okay?

04:54.745 --> 04:56.111
Ranjit, get the car.

04:56.113 --> 04:57.879
Getting the car.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.082
Baby, I can't wait
to meet your mom,

05:00.084 --> 05:01.716
but I kind of got to go on

05:01.718 --> 05:03.518
a little excursion
with the boys right now.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.986
What?
Where are you going?

05:04.988 --> 05:08.423
Me and the boys have to go
teach someone some manners.

05:11.494 --> 05:13.895
Are there any elk
on Long Island?

05:18.134 --> 05:20.135
♪ My gallant
housekeeping crew ♪

05:20.137 --> 05:21.136
♪ Good morning.

05:21.138 --> 05:23.205

05:23.207 --> 05:25.207

(doorbell rings)

05:31.849 --> 05:33.615
Oh, bother it!

05:33.617 --> 05:34.816
I'll get it.

05:39.252 --> 05:40.585
Ahoy, Marshall!

05:40.731 --> 05:41.668
(Captain grunts)

05:42.016 --> 05:44.985
Are you okay, Robin?
No, I'm not okay,

05:44.986 --> 05:47.486
because apparently,
I am marrying my dad

05:47.488 --> 05:48.821
in a few hours.

05:48.823 --> 05:50.322
Oh, sweetie, no.

05:50.324 --> 05:52.358
I'm sure that's not true.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.692
I mean, th-there's
so much

05:53.694 --> 05:55.194
you don't know
about your father.

05:55.196 --> 05:57.363
There were... oh, there
were so many other

05:57.365 --> 05:59.031
red flags in our marriage.

05:59.033 --> 06:00.432
I mean, for instance,

06:00.434 --> 06:01.400
do you know that

06:01.402 --> 06:03.202
before he was engaged to me,

06:03.204 --> 06:06.172
<i>he was engaged to marry</i>
<i>an exotic dancer?</i>

06:06.174 --> 06:07.807
<i>Hello!</i>

06:07.809 --> 06:08.941
Red flag!

06:08.943 --> 06:10.476
LILY:
Oh, Genevieve,

06:10.478 --> 06:11.477
not good.

06:11.479 --> 06:13.646
And did you know
that one time,

06:13.648 --> 06:15.247
<i>to impress women,</i>

06:15.249 --> 06:17.683
<i>he dressed up like</i>
<i>a Prussian aristocrat,</i>

06:17.685 --> 06:19.251
had a painting of himself made,

06:19.253 --> 06:22.154
<i>and posed next to it</i>
<i>in an art gallery?</i>

06:22.156 --> 06:23.522
Can you imagine?

06:23.524 --> 06:25.891
Oh, that's a
rough one.

06:25.893 --> 06:28.360
Darling, darling,
the list goes on.

06:28.362 --> 06:31.530
<i>He would always take</i>
<i>his mother's side in arguments.</i>

06:31.532 --> 06:33.799
<i>He never checked with me</i>
<i>before making plans.</i>

06:33.801 --> 06:37.169
<i>And our rehearsal dinner...</i>
<i>oh, boy, did we have it out</i>

06:37.171 --> 06:39.972
<i>right before our</i>
<i>rehearsal dinner!</i>

06:42.709 --> 06:43.876
Thank you, Linus.

06:45.111 --> 06:46.145
GENEVIEVE:
For the first

06:46.147 --> 06:47.880
ten years I knew him,

06:47.882 --> 06:50.549
I didn't even know what
your father did for a living.

06:50.551 --> 06:51.817
Every time I used
to ask him,

06:51.819 --> 06:53.319
he'd just say...
Please!

06:53.321 --> 06:55.254
Yes, that's exactly
what he used to say.

06:55.256 --> 06:56.689
How did you know that?

06:58.225 --> 06:59.391
Heck of a jab,
Marshall.

06:59.393 --> 07:00.459
Well-placed.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.493
MARSHALL:
Captain,

07:01.495 --> 07:02.995
I know something happened

07:02.997 --> 07:04.864
between you and Lily last night.

07:04.866 --> 07:05.898
What?

07:05.900 --> 07:07.333
No. Nothing happened.

07:07.335 --> 07:08.567
Captain's honor.

07:08.569 --> 07:10.035
Well, you can ask my fiancée.

07:10.037 --> 07:11.904
Fiancée?
What-what fiancée?

07:11.906 --> 07:12.905
Captain.

07:12.907 --> 07:14.640
Permission to clear things up?
Granted.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.774
Me.

07:15.776 --> 07:16.909
We're engaged.

07:16.911 --> 07:18.544
It's "boats,
boats, boats"!

07:18.546 --> 07:20.713
Ted, look!
Uh, yeah.

07:20.715 --> 07:23.015
I mean, yeah, I know her
from that commercial.

07:23.017 --> 07:24.216
Boats, boats, boats!

07:24.218 --> 07:26.151
And only from
that commercial.

07:26.153 --> 07:28.053
No, you
banged her.

07:28.055 --> 07:29.088
Remember?

07:29.090 --> 07:30.289
Like, a bunch
of times.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.391
You knocked "boots,
boots, boots""

07:32.393 --> 07:33.859
MARSHALL: All right, Captain.
What the hell

07:33.861 --> 07:35.027
happened here
last night?

07:35.029 --> 07:37.229
Well, it was just
after four bells.

07:37.231 --> 07:38.130
(phone ringing)

07:38.132 --> 07:39.198
Ahoy!

07:39.200 --> 07:40.566
(choked up):
Hi, I-I know it's late,

07:40.568 --> 07:41.901
but I've got to get out of here.

07:41.903 --> 07:44.236
CAPTAIN: <i>So I sent the car.</i>
<i>When she got here...</i>

07:44.238 --> 07:45.371
Lily, what a lovely...

07:45.373 --> 07:46.972
Can I use your powder room?

07:46.974 --> 07:49.008
And then she went
to the powder room.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.542
She was in there
quite a while, actually.

07:50.544 --> 07:52.611
Probably a deuce.
Go on.

07:52.613 --> 07:53.813
CAPTAIN:
And when she came out,

07:53.814 --> 07:55.214
she had to leave right away.

07:55.216 --> 07:56.482
It was odd.

07:56.484 --> 07:58.751
But I assure you,
nothing inappropriate happened

07:58.753 --> 07:59.985
between me and your wife.

07:59.987 --> 08:01.954
Captain, I understand
what you're saying,

08:01.956 --> 08:04.390
but what you don't
understand is that

08:04.392 --> 08:05.624
Lily is my wife,

08:05.626 --> 08:07.092
and I love her
way too much

08:07.094 --> 08:08.260
to behave rationally
right now!

08:08.262 --> 08:09.528
En garde!

08:10.263 --> 08:13.332
This is the best
day of my life.

08:13.334 --> 08:16.101
Oh, darling,
come on, no, no.

08:16.103 --> 08:18.237
You're not marrying
your father.

08:18.239 --> 08:19.571
I mean,
your father...

08:19.573 --> 08:21.573
I mean, let's just
put it this way.

08:21.575 --> 08:23.542
Your father was
a sociopath.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.245
He slept with
over 20 women.

08:26.247 --> 08:28.247
And sure, you know,

08:28.249 --> 08:29.481
we were friends
for years first

08:29.483 --> 08:31.784
and it was entertaining
watching him lie

08:31.786 --> 08:34.486
to those poor girls
to get inside their snow pants,

08:34.488 --> 08:37.256
but I should have
known back then

08:37.258 --> 08:39.558
this was not
husband material.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.260
I mean, even your
Uncle Jim, you know,

08:41.261 --> 08:42.461
his gay black brother...

08:42.462 --> 08:43.929
Will you shut up!

08:46.099 --> 08:47.466
Go for Barney!

08:47.468 --> 08:49.835
Your bride is freaking
the crap out right now.

08:49.837 --> 08:51.136
Where the hell are you?

08:51.138 --> 08:52.871
I warn you,
Captain,

08:52.873 --> 08:57.943
I've pretended to have a duel
with actual swords twice.

08:57.945 --> 08:59.278
I warn you, Marshall,

08:59.280 --> 09:01.080
I was on the Olympic
fencing team.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.948
Won three gold medals.

09:02.950 --> 09:04.616
I warn you, Captain,

09:04.618 --> 09:06.986
I'm starting to feel like
this was a mistake.

09:06.988 --> 09:09.521
I think I'd better
not say where I am.

09:09.523 --> 09:11.156
I am not kidding around here!

09:11.158 --> 09:12.524
Tell me where you are!

09:12.526 --> 09:13.726
(sighs)

09:13.728 --> 09:15.794
We're at the Captain's house.

09:19.599 --> 09:21.166
What is it?
What's wrong?

09:22.035 --> 09:25.337
I am so busted.

09:28.308 --> 09:31.176
Thank you, Linus.

09:34.981 --> 09:36.982
You have another piece of gum?

09:41.221 --> 09:42.988
LILY:
<i>I can keep a secret.</i>

09:42.990 --> 09:45.157
I can keep a secret real good.

09:45.159 --> 09:46.959
Are you chewing gum?

09:46.961 --> 09:49.028
I can keep a secret
like nobody's business,

09:49.030 --> 09:51.730
'cause it is nobody's business.

09:51.732 --> 09:53.032
You never chew gum.

09:53.034 --> 09:54.767
You shouldn't
chew gum in here.

09:54.769 --> 09:57.069
'Cause it's a secret,
and I'm keeping it!

09:57.071 --> 09:58.904
Wait!

09:58.906 --> 10:00.039
Stop the duel!

10:00.041 --> 10:00.806
Oh, thank God.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.207
I mean, why?

10:02.209 --> 10:03.175
TED:
Why?

10:03.177 --> 10:04.843
Because I just solved
the mystery,

10:04.845 --> 10:05.878
that's why.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.480
Mosby Boys!

10:10.016 --> 10:12.251
We agreed you wouldn't
do that anymore.

10:13.019 --> 10:14.720
Mystery? What mystery?

10:14.722 --> 10:16.855
Lily has a secret.

10:18.258 --> 10:19.992
She's hiding something,

10:19.994 --> 10:22.694
and I know what it is.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:31.371 --> 10:33.872
Okay, what is she hiding?

10:33.874 --> 10:35.774
I'll tell you in a minute.

10:35.776 --> 10:39.344
I want to enjoy the suspense
a little bit first.

10:40.313 --> 10:42.481
Ooh.

10:49.927 --> 10:52.695
Oh, my God, will
you just tell us!

10:55.032 --> 10:56.699
Very well.

10:56.701 --> 10:57.934
Now, we can all agree

10:57.936 --> 11:00.537
that this is the first
time I've ever set foot

11:00.539 --> 11:02.005
in this house, correct?

11:02.007 --> 11:04.207
Oh, this is
going to be unbearable.

11:04.209 --> 11:06.142
Now, Captain, your powder room--

11:06.144 --> 11:08.778
does it face out
on the ocean?

11:08.780 --> 11:10.880
Of course, right over the cliff.

11:10.882 --> 11:12.048
Just as I suspected.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.449
And if I were to walk

11:13.451 --> 11:15.351
into this powder
room right now,

11:15.353 --> 11:17.854
I believe I'd see a
potted plant of some sort.

11:17.856 --> 11:19.055
Is that correct?

11:19.057 --> 11:21.057
Yes. There's a daisy.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.359
A daisy. Interesting.

11:23.361 --> 11:25.929
Uh, not traditionally
an indoor plant,

11:25.931 --> 11:29.032
but I suppose
it gets plenty of light

11:29.034 --> 11:30.833
with the southern exposure.

11:30.835 --> 11:32.569
That's right, it does.

11:32.571 --> 11:34.904
Will you please fetch the daisy?

11:34.906 --> 11:37.140
Aye-aye.

11:38.409 --> 11:39.809
I totally solved it.

11:39.811 --> 11:41.177
You didn't solve it.

11:41.946 --> 11:43.880
You didn't solve it.

11:43.882 --> 11:45.081
You didn't
solve it.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.583
You didn't solve it.

11:46.585 --> 11:48.585
Did you solve...?
No, you didn't solve it.

11:48.587 --> 11:50.386
I solved it!

11:50.388 --> 11:51.821
Ah.

11:51.823 --> 11:53.590
Thank you, Captain.

11:53.592 --> 11:55.625
Now...

11:55.627 --> 11:57.760
a simple question.

11:57.762 --> 12:01.230
When Lily and Marshall are apart
for an extended period of time,

12:01.232 --> 12:04.934
what is the one thing
Lily always does?

12:04.936 --> 12:05.935
Cry?

12:05.937 --> 12:07.170
Masturbate?

12:07.172 --> 12:08.037
Karate?

12:08.039 --> 12:09.105
Go sailing?

12:09.107 --> 12:11.107
No.

12:11.109 --> 12:13.376
When Lily and Marshall are apart

12:13.378 --> 12:16.879
for a long period of time,

12:16.881 --> 12:20.483
Lily... always...

12:28.292 --> 12:30.693
...starts smoking again.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.363
That's true, she does.

12:33.365 --> 12:35.398
Happened when she went
to Paris in college.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.501
It happened when she moved
to San Francisco, and last week,

12:38.503 --> 12:40.370
<i>it happened again.</i>

12:40.372 --> 12:42.705
<i>From the moment Marshall left</i>
<i>for Minnesota,</i>

12:42.707 --> 12:44.641
<i>Lily's been secretly</i>
<i>puffing down the ciggies</i>

12:44.643 --> 12:47.610
<i>like a 46-year-old grandma</i>
<i>at a Reno slot machine.</i>

12:47.612 --> 12:49.812
<i>Problem was,</i>
<i>come Friday morning,</i>

12:49.814 --> 12:53.049
<i>she knew she'd have</i>
<i>to quit again,cold turkey.</i>

12:53.051 --> 12:54.851
<i>And it wouldn't be easy.</i>

12:54.853 --> 12:56.886
<i>She tried to make it</i>
<i>a whole car ride</i>

12:56.888 --> 12:58.154
<i>without a fix, but couldn't.</i>

12:58.156 --> 12:59.822
So, she pretended to be annoyed

12:59.824 --> 13:02.759
by perfectly reasonable things,
<i>like my stylish driving gloves</i>

13:02.761 --> 13:06.396
<i>and my appreciation of the</i>
<i>historic van Otterloop manse.</i>

13:06.398 --> 13:11.934
<i>All so she could have</i>
<i>one last smoke on the train.</i>

13:11.936 --> 13:14.237
<i>But afterwards,</i>
<i>her breath told the tale.</i>

13:14.239 --> 13:17.573
<i>And that's why,</i>
<i>when she got to the hotel,</i>

13:17.575 --> 13:19.509
<i>Lily...</i>

13:19.511 --> 13:22.578
<i>was chewing... gum.</i>

13:22.580 --> 13:23.780
Lily never chews gum.

13:23.782 --> 13:24.681
What? Never?

13:24.683 --> 13:25.748
Well, hardly ever.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.283
Great job, Ted.

13:27.285 --> 13:29.986
That's some pretty
solid evidence. Gum.

13:29.988 --> 13:33.456
(laughing):
Oh, Barney, my dear boy.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.058
I'm just getting started.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.459
Getting started?

13:36.461 --> 13:37.593
TED:
<i>Lily knew that cigarette</i>

13:37.595 --> 13:38.995
<i>was probably her last</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

13:38.997 --> 13:41.097
<i>She needed something</i>
<i>to keep her nerves calm,</i>

13:41.099 --> 13:42.732
<i>so she headed to the bar.</i>

13:42.734 --> 13:45.301
Anytime you see me
without a drink in my hand,

13:45.303 --> 13:47.570
you put a drink in my hand.

13:47.572 --> 13:50.273
Are you my guy, Linus?

13:50.275 --> 13:53.443
TED: <i>What followed was</i>
<i>a long day and a half for Lily.</i>

13:53.445 --> 13:55.378
<i>A really long day and a half.</i>

13:55.380 --> 13:56.913
<i>Oh, it's kind of insane</i>

13:56.915 --> 13:59.148
<i>how much happened</i>
<i>in just a day and a half.</i>

13:59.150 --> 14:00.950
<i>Anyway, Marshall returned,</i>

14:00.952 --> 14:04.387
<i>they had a big fight,</i>
<i>Lily stormed out.</i>

14:04.389 --> 14:05.555
<i>And that's when she realized,</i>

14:05.557 --> 14:07.523
<i>if she was gonna sneak one</i>
<i>this weekend,</i>

14:07.525 --> 14:08.725
<i>this was her chance.</i>

14:08.727 --> 14:11.627
<i>And after that fight,</i>
<i>boy, did she need one.</i>

14:11.629 --> 14:14.731
Only problem: she was all out.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.032
<i>Now,</i>

14:16.034 --> 14:17.166
it's 3:00 a.m.,

14:17.168 --> 14:18.367
you need a cigarette,

14:18.369 --> 14:20.069
and the only place
that's open is an EZ Pick

14:20.071 --> 14:21.370
that's five miles down the road.

14:21.372 --> 14:22.538
You have no car.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.240
What do you do? Go.

14:24.242 --> 14:25.208
Dirt-bike it.

14:25.210 --> 14:26.309
I can walk that far.

14:26.311 --> 14:27.276
Masturbate.

14:27.278 --> 14:28.277
Take a boat.

14:28.279 --> 14:30.780
What? A boat? No.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.116
Dude, she got a ride
in your car, remember?

14:33.118 --> 14:34.650
(phone ringing)

14:34.652 --> 14:35.818
Ahoy.

14:35.820 --> 14:36.786
Hi. I-I know it's late,

14:36.788 --> 14:38.187
but I've got to get out of here.

14:38.189 --> 14:40.289
I want to make
one stop first.

14:41.658 --> 14:43.760
TED:
<i>The problem was,</i>

14:43.762 --> 14:46.662
<i>Lily didn't want to smoke</i>
<i>in front of her new employer.</i>

14:46.664 --> 14:47.930
<i>So, when she arrived</i>

14:47.932 --> 14:49.899
<i>at the Captain's house,</i>
<i>there was only one</i>

14:49.901 --> 14:51.100
<i>possible course of action.</i>

14:51.102 --> 14:52.635
Can I use your powder room?

14:54.705 --> 14:56.839
TED:
<i>Now,</i>

14:56.841 --> 14:57.707
you're Lily.

14:57.709 --> 14:58.975
You've just had a cigarette

14:58.977 --> 15:00.076
in your boss's powder room.

15:00.078 --> 15:01.844
What do you do
with the cigarette butt?

15:01.846 --> 15:03.446
Throw it out the window?
Flush it?

15:03.448 --> 15:05.081
No, she-she wouldn't do
either of those things.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.382
She's an environmentalist.

15:06.384 --> 15:07.383
Stick it in your purse?

15:07.385 --> 15:08.451
Marshall could find it there.

15:08.453 --> 15:09.819
Throw it in the trash can.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.287
The Captain would
find it there.

15:11.289 --> 15:13.022
Hide it in a boat.

15:13.024 --> 15:14.957
A boat? Wait.
How would that...

15:14.959 --> 15:16.125
I don't know.

15:16.127 --> 15:18.628
I just... I like boats.

15:19.797 --> 15:21.764
No.

15:21.766 --> 15:24.167
There's only one place
that she would put it.

15:24.169 --> 15:26.102
A place where, eventually,

15:26.104 --> 15:29.438
it would decompose and serve
as a natural mulch.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.341
It's in the daisy.

15:32.343 --> 15:34.277
And sure enough,

15:34.279 --> 15:36.379
if I dig around...

15:36.381 --> 15:40.316
I am all but guaranteed
to find...

15:42.119 --> 15:43.820
A pregnancy test.

15:46.056 --> 15:47.824
You could smoke those?

15:53.997 --> 15:56.165
(vomiting)

15:57.968 --> 16:00.136
(panting)

16:02.206 --> 16:03.506
Oh, no.

16:03.508 --> 16:04.974
So, you want
the Kennedy package?

16:04.976 --> 16:06.342
Bingo.

16:08.212 --> 16:10.613
One other little thing.

16:10.615 --> 16:12.782
When you do put a drink
in my hand,

16:12.784 --> 16:14.784
let's make it non-alcoholic.

16:14.786 --> 16:17.086
There's a chance
I might be pregnant.

16:17.088 --> 16:18.454
Okay, Linus,

16:18.456 --> 16:21.224
don't start popping
the sparkling cider just yet.

16:21.226 --> 16:23.359
I'm just being cautious.

16:23.361 --> 16:25.328
I'll take a test
when I get home.

16:25.330 --> 16:27.029
It can wait.

17:44.342 --> 17:46.175
There's just...
there's so much we have to do.

17:46.177 --> 17:48.878
You know, we have to, um...
we have to do research on...

17:48.880 --> 17:50.813
uh, hospitals in Italy,
and we have to, uh...

17:50.815 --> 17:52.715
We're not going to Italy.

17:52.717 --> 17:54.517
Of course we are.

17:55.319 --> 17:56.552
Lily, we have to do this.

17:56.554 --> 17:57.820
You're gonna live in Rome,

17:57.822 --> 18:00.056
and you're gonna get your dream,
because...

18:00.058 --> 18:02.425
because you're giving me mine.

18:03.293 --> 18:04.860
Again.

18:04.862 --> 18:06.696
But there's gonna be
all sorts of paperwork,

18:06.698 --> 18:08.931
and-and if she's born outside
of the U.S.,

18:08.933 --> 18:10.399
she could never
become president.

18:10.401 --> 18:12.735
It's a girl?

18:12.737 --> 18:15.871
Oh. I don't know, but...

18:15.873 --> 18:18.140
in my mind,
I kind of think she is.

18:18.142 --> 18:19.241
Oh.

18:19.243 --> 18:20.876
I love you so much.

18:20.878 --> 18:23.512
Mmm.

18:23.514 --> 18:25.715
We're gonna give you
some privacy.

18:27.884 --> 18:29.952
It's my room. Why
do I have to...?

18:29.954 --> 18:31.520
Just... come on.

18:34.424 --> 18:36.359
I thought this was an exit.
No, balcony.

18:36.361 --> 18:37.660
Ah. Oh.

18:37.662 --> 18:39.729
Well, we'll just give them
a few minutes, and then...

18:39.731 --> 18:42.198
Mm-hmm.
...we'll go back in and...

18:42.200 --> 18:43.666
Oh.

18:43.668 --> 18:45.868
Oh, they are both naked.

18:45.870 --> 18:47.103
Yeah, they work fast.

18:47.105 --> 18:49.138
Yes. (sighs)

18:49.140 --> 18:51.140
Oh, darling.

18:51.142 --> 18:53.142
Oh, you're going
to be fine.

18:53.144 --> 18:55.244
You know, for every marriage
in the world

18:55.246 --> 18:57.480
like I had with your dad,
you know, there's...

18:57.482 --> 19:00.216
there's a marriage
like those two in there.

19:00.218 --> 19:02.518
And, oh, marriage is...

19:02.520 --> 19:03.786
Oh, it's terrifying.

19:03.788 --> 19:05.287
It's-it's like flying.

19:05.289 --> 19:08.457
You know, you're-you're filled
with this mortal dread,

19:08.459 --> 19:11.060
but if you find someone
you feel safe with,

19:11.062 --> 19:14.263
it's like flying!

19:14.265 --> 19:18.367
But if you got someone that you
feel is really there for you,

19:18.369 --> 19:20.636
someone you can depend on,

19:20.638 --> 19:22.938
you're gonna be fine.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.840
Do you have someone
like that?
