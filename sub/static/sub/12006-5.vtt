<i>Toby: Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:01.919 --> 00:06.022
All right, let's begin with the long-awaited
unveiling of Tank's latest creation.

00:06.292 --> 00:08.259
Welcome back to the class.

00:08.294 --> 00:09.994
Bay, I am your coach.

00:10.029 --> 00:11.229
I don't even wanna be here!

00:11.263 --> 00:13.164
You tricked me into playing,
and now you're yelling at me.

00:13.198 --> 00:15.033
- So I'm done.
- I have talked to Nikki

00:15.067 --> 00:17.101
and Toby extensively, and they have been

00:17.136 --> 00:19.070
very clear about what they want.

00:19.104 --> 00:21.039
You think I don't know my own daughter?

00:21.073 --> 00:23.958
Seriously, Nik and I could put
our whole house in this room.

00:25.961 --> 00:27.078
I'm thinking about getting my own place.

00:27.112 --> 00:29.080
Well, I'm excited for you.

00:29.114 --> 00:32.083
So Toby and I were talking
about field hockey this morning,

00:32.116 --> 00:34.319
and let's face it, you and I
are gonna be carrying this team.

00:34.353 --> 00:35.386
Why aren't we moving?

00:35.421 --> 00:37.221
What would you say

00:37.256 --> 00:39.924
about going to Nashville,
just the two of us?

00:39.959 --> 00:41.359
That's when Renzo and I
are gonna go to New York

00:41.393 --> 00:43.311
<i>- to pitch my new book idea.
- I get it.</i>

00:43.362 --> 00:46.331
You wanna fly solo. Well, you know what?

00:46.365 --> 00:47.932
I can fly solo too.

00:51.303 --> 00:53.204
So, to scour a pan, you need to...

00:53.238 --> 00:54.339
Light it on fire.

00:54.373 --> 00:56.040
(Sighs) Toby.

00:56.075 --> 00:57.292
You soak it first and then you scrub it.

00:57.326 --> 00:58.309
Great. Otherwise,

00:58.344 --> 00:59.944
it'll ruin your pans.

00:59.979 --> 01:01.212
If he ever uses them.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.251
Okay. What is that? What's that look for?

01:07.285 --> 01:10.254
I just can't believe that
this is your last dinner here.

01:10.469 --> 01:13.404
Mom, come on, we're still
gonna be able to eat together

01:13.438 --> 01:15.406
after I move out.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.474
Why can't you wait a week?

01:17.493 --> 01:19.476
Until we're both in town to help you.

01:19.495 --> 01:21.329
I paid first and last month's rent.

01:21.363 --> 01:23.080
So I'm already paying for it.

01:23.115 --> 01:24.282
He wants to start his new life.

01:24.316 --> 01:25.416
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

01:25.450 --> 01:27.552
Oh. That would be Senator Rue.

01:27.586 --> 01:30.747
Gotta take that. Hey, Jack. Yep.

01:30.752 --> 01:33.291
Are you sure I shouldn't try
to move my trip to New York?

01:33.325 --> 01:35.459
Don't you have the meeting
with Renzo's publisher friend?

01:35.494 --> 01:37.195
I mean, you don't wanna flake out on her.

01:37.229 --> 01:38.262
Yeah, but I...

01:38.297 --> 01:40.131
you've been so excited about this.

01:40.165 --> 01:41.132
Yeah, you're right.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.433
I am excited.

01:42.467 --> 01:45.436
I think I finally have an idea with a hook.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.538
I can really see myself selling that book.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.440
And I could see it on
the shelves, and I...

01:49.474 --> 01:53.311
I can see I'm... I'm getting
ahead of myself, aren't I?

01:53.345 --> 01:55.213
No! That's called optimism.

01:55.247 --> 01:58.449
Now go over there, sell your
second book, then come back and...

01:58.483 --> 02:00.518
obsessively hang some
curtains in my new place.

02:00.552 --> 02:02.186
- (Laughs)
- You know what?

02:02.204 --> 02:03.187
I'm gonna skip this whole Nashville thing

02:03.222 --> 02:04.422
and help you move, young man.

02:04.456 --> 02:06.123
- Really?
- Yes!

02:06.158 --> 02:08.192
- That awesome.
- Yeah. It's just, you know...

02:08.210 --> 02:09.327
it's gonna be a dog and pony show.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.128
I'm not gonna miss anything.

02:11.163 --> 02:12.496
Well, great. Then, uh,

02:12.531 --> 02:15.499
I'm gonna go call Travis and
tell him that he's off the hook.

02:15.533 --> 02:17.401
And by call, I mean text.

02:17.436 --> 02:19.053
Because he's deaf. (Knocks on counter)

02:21.106 --> 02:23.441
Are you sure it's okay for
you to miss this trip, honey?

02:23.475 --> 02:26.427
Yeah yeah. There's gonna be a
lot of senators there already.

02:26.478 --> 02:28.412
I'll just be another guy in a Navy suit

02:28.447 --> 02:30.314
his wife picked out for him.

02:30.349 --> 02:31.315
You go to New York.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.117
Have fun.

02:33.151 --> 02:36.520
You know, you haven't asked
me yet what my book idea is.

02:36.555 --> 02:38.322
What is your new book idea?

02:38.357 --> 02:40.424
Well, now you're just
asking because I told you to.

02:40.459 --> 02:43.261
Kathryn, do you wanna
tell me the idea or not?

02:44.596 --> 02:46.330
I'll tell you later.

02:46.365 --> 02:47.431
I have to pack.

02:52.237 --> 02:54.455
Oh, you did not need to bring
these all the way up here.

02:54.506 --> 02:56.374
I could have gotten them
back from you on Wednesday.

02:56.408 --> 02:58.426
Oh, no, an artist needs her tools.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.045
(Softly chuckles)

03:01.079 --> 03:02.313
Wow, I don't even know what that is,

03:02.347 --> 03:05.216
- but it is dope.
- It's not really a thing.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.418
It's more of a... a feeling.

03:07.452 --> 03:09.487
Like, let's call it anger.

03:09.521 --> 03:12.556
I had a pretty rage-y junior year.

03:12.591 --> 03:15.192
Uh, it's... (Stammers)

03:15.227 --> 03:17.528
I don't know art words, but it rules.

03:17.562 --> 03:19.263
(Both chuckle)

03:19.298 --> 03:21.165
I can't believe you made all of these.

03:21.199 --> 03:23.367
Yeah, I'm actually feeling
a little overwhelmed

03:23.402 --> 03:26.103
by my, uh, prolificness right now.

03:26.138 --> 03:27.338
I'm supposed to pick some pieces

03:27.372 --> 03:30.374
to show this Pratt recruiter tomorrow.

03:30.409 --> 03:32.376
Oh. Well, let's see.

03:32.411 --> 03:34.345
Well, you should definitely
do the soccer ball one,

03:34.379 --> 03:36.547
<i>uh, the bathtub one.</i>

03:36.581 --> 03:37.548
<i>And...</i>

03:37.582 --> 03:39.483
Oh, the face thing.

03:39.518 --> 03:41.452
Now that thing rules.

03:41.470 --> 03:42.520
Oh. Hey, Daphne.

03:44.589 --> 03:47.258
This is my friend Tank.

03:47.292 --> 03:48.509
He's from my college life.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.177
And Tank, this is Daphne.

03:50.228 --> 03:51.178
Hey, nice to meet you.

03:51.229 --> 03:54.365
Hi, uh, nice to meet you too.

03:54.399 --> 03:57.234
(Chuckles nervously) Wow, that was bad.

03:57.269 --> 04:00.271
I'm sorry. I did a little signing in church

04:00.305 --> 04:02.273
when I was little, but I barely remember.

04:02.307 --> 04:03.474
Eh. "A" for effort.

04:03.508 --> 04:05.242
(Girls chuckle)

04:05.277 --> 04:07.078
Hey, where were you, by the way?

04:07.112 --> 04:09.380
You totally missed Toby's last supper.

04:09.414 --> 04:11.115
Oh, Sharee and I wanted to get in

04:11.149 --> 04:13.117
an extra practice before tomorrow.

04:13.151 --> 04:17.088
Toby's bringing in some girls from
another school to run defense drills.

04:17.122 --> 04:20.190
<i>- Wait, I thought you were on the team too.
- Nope.</i>

04:20.225 --> 04:21.358
Dodged that bullet. Chose my art.

04:21.392 --> 04:22.360
It was very noble.

04:22.394 --> 04:24.261
(Laughs)

04:24.296 --> 04:26.547
Hey, did you know your sister is like

04:26.598 --> 04:28.349
the Michael Phelps of art?

04:28.383 --> 04:30.368
Oh, yeah, I know. (Chuckles)

Uh, okay, seriously...

04:42.180 --> 04:44.515
you are like a genius.

04:51.423 --> 04:53.457
Well, I should, uh, head back to campus.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.359
But I'll see you Wednesday?

04:55.377 --> 04:56.360
Yeah.

04:56.378 --> 04:57.495
<i>Okay.</i>

04:57.529 --> 04:59.363
Good night.

05:05.070 --> 05:08.372
I swear I had no idea that he liked me.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.474
Well, he's cute. Do you like him?

05:10.509 --> 05:13.277
(Sighs) Not like that.

05:14.346 --> 05:16.313
(Gasps) You're a person

05:16.348 --> 05:19.083
who has people crushing
on you like all the time.

05:19.117 --> 05:21.085
- What do you do?
- That's not true.

05:22.154 --> 05:23.287
You just have to

05:23.321 --> 05:25.122
tell him how you feel.

05:25.157 --> 05:26.107
Or don't feel.

05:27.392 --> 05:29.160
Can't I just hope that it goes away?

05:29.194 --> 05:31.395
Usually it doesn't go away for a while.

05:31.430 --> 05:35.232
I've had my heart broken
like a zillion times,

05:35.267 --> 05:37.334
and I just don't wanna do that to him.

05:38.537 --> 05:41.288
Well, the longer you
wait, the harder it is.

05:41.339 --> 05:43.174
Trust me.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.076
You just have to rip off the band-aid.

05:45.110 --> 05:46.177
It's the right thing to do.

<i>Regina: Wait a sec.</i>

05:59.324 --> 06:01.492
You got into a fight with this girl,

06:01.526 --> 06:03.494
and you are still driving her to school?

06:03.528 --> 06:07.214
Well, it's not her fault. Sharee
just had a rough start at Carlton.

06:07.249 --> 06:09.333
You've got college apps due in a few weeks

06:09.367 --> 06:11.135
and a probation officer to keep happy.

06:11.169 --> 06:13.404
I met with him on Monday.
Everything's fine at the clinic.

06:13.438 --> 06:16.206
I'm a third through my
hours. And it's all good.

06:16.224 --> 06:18.375
Maybe it is now, but
if you keep hanging out

06:18.393 --> 06:20.261
with questionable kids with anger issues...

06:20.312 --> 06:21.428
You don't even know Sharee.

06:21.479 --> 06:22.546
She got you in detention.

06:22.581 --> 06:25.399
- That's all I need to know.
- (Sighs)

06:25.433 --> 06:27.184
<i>(Knocks on table)</i>

06:27.218 --> 06:29.220
I'm just trying to remind you

06:29.254 --> 06:31.288
that who you choose to hang out with

06:31.323 --> 06:33.290
is really important.

06:33.325 --> 06:35.159
They can either keep you on your path

06:35.193 --> 06:37.444
or drive you right off it.

06:37.495 --> 06:38.562
Like Jace.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.231
I messed up this summer.

06:40.265 --> 06:41.498
I know that. But I moved past it.

06:41.533 --> 06:44.401
And if you continue to
question everything I do...

06:44.419 --> 06:45.569
I just don't think you
should be driving her.

06:45.587 --> 06:46.570
That's all I'm saying.

06:46.605 --> 06:49.240
I made a promise, okay?

06:49.274 --> 06:50.507
Sharee is a good person.

06:50.542 --> 06:53.210
She just needs someone
to give her a chance.

06:53.245 --> 06:54.478
Here.

06:58.516 --> 07:00.351
And of course that someone has to be you.

07:00.385 --> 07:01.352
<i>(Door closes)</i>

07:03.421 --> 07:05.272
- Dad, you got that?
- Yeah, I got it. It's fine.

07:05.307 --> 07:06.557
Where do you want Nikki's photos?

07:06.591 --> 07:07.591
Oh. Just by the window.

07:11.262 --> 07:12.396
Thanks for bringing some
of Nikki's stuff over.

07:12.430 --> 07:13.664
Yeah, no problem.

07:13.698 --> 07:16.200
I really wanna set up a little
office area for her right here.

07:16.234 --> 07:18.235
- That'd be nice.
- Is there room for that?

07:18.270 --> 07:20.404
Well, yeah, if you know
how to maximize your space.

07:20.438 --> 07:24.141
I feel like this one room can
be like four different rooms.

07:24.175 --> 07:26.343
I sent some pictures to
Nikki. She loves the balcony.

07:26.378 --> 07:27.478
Yeah yeah, she said.

07:27.512 --> 07:29.580
I wanna set it up so
it's part hers, you know?

07:29.614 --> 07:31.582
So she has a home to come home to.

07:31.616 --> 07:34.335
I mean, I know she has your place, but...

07:34.386 --> 07:36.520
That's a really nice gesture,
and I'm sure she'll love it.

07:36.554 --> 07:38.188
And you too.

07:38.223 --> 07:39.456
I wa you to know, you're
always welcome here.

07:41.292 --> 07:43.260
Okay, I'm gonna grab the rest of the stuff.

07:43.294 --> 07:45.262
Uh, dad? No more heavy stuff.

07:45.297 --> 07:46.263
I got it.

07:46.298 --> 07:47.231
(Sighs deeply)

07:47.265 --> 07:49.149
Thanks.

07:49.184 --> 07:50.184
Is that like a thing?

07:50.235 --> 07:51.352
They get married, they start acting

07:51.403 --> 07:52.353
like they're your parents?

07:52.404 --> 07:54.321
I'm afraid so.

07:54.356 --> 07:57.241
Nikki sent me a link to one of those
"I've fallen and I can't get up" phones.

07:57.275 --> 07:58.242
(Laughs)

07:58.276 --> 08:01.312
She was kidding, but she wasn't.

08:01.346 --> 08:03.480
- So how you been?
- Uh, good.

08:03.515 --> 08:05.382
You know, good. Yeah, you know, good.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.451
Passing laws, taking names?

08:07.485 --> 08:10.387
Yeah... yeah.

08:10.422 --> 08:11.555
Uh, how about you?

08:11.589 --> 08:14.558
I miss Nikki.

08:14.592 --> 08:18.529
It's just so weird having
the whole house to myself.

08:20.498 --> 08:22.433
Well, you should come
over for dinner sometime.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.435
I'd really like that.

08:24.469 --> 08:26.169
And yeah, Toby's been so great.

08:26.187 --> 08:27.337
He's been checking up on me.

08:27.355 --> 08:30.307
Well, he's really happy
Nikki's coming home.

08:36.246 --> 08:39.183
Nikki hasn't discussed this with Toby yet,

08:39.217 --> 08:43.354
but they've asked her to stay
another six months in Peru.

08:43.388 --> 08:46.490
And, uh, what is she gonna do?

08:46.524 --> 08:48.409
She hasn't decided anything yet,

08:48.460 --> 08:51.462
but she's having an amazing time there,

08:51.496 --> 08:53.364
and she's not ready to come back.

08:53.398 --> 08:56.300
I see.

08:56.334 --> 08:57.634
(Clears throat)

08:57.669 --> 08:59.636
Oh, God. You know what?
I'm... I'm so sorry.

08:59.671 --> 09:02.106
I shouldn't have said anything. It's not...

09:02.140 --> 09:05.109
No. You know what? Um,
thank you for telling me.

09:13.518 --> 09:15.486
You leave us alone!

09:15.520 --> 09:17.220
We'll just do fine without you!

09:17.238 --> 09:19.356
You don't need me. You need help.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.391
Get out!

09:20.425 --> 09:22.493
Go!

09:24.396 --> 09:25.596
- Baby...
- Stop!

09:25.630 --> 09:28.265
<i>(Car starts)</i>

09:28.299 --> 09:30.250
<i>(Tires screeching)</i>

09:32.537 --> 09:34.471
Let's go.

09:34.506 --> 09:36.340
Is everything okay?

09:36.374 --> 09:38.425
Yeah.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.543
It's just drama. It's cool.

09:39.577 --> 09:41.512
<i>(Changing radio stations)</i>

09:41.546 --> 09:43.514
Is that a bruise?

09:43.548 --> 09:45.299
It's from field hockey.

09:49.587 --> 09:51.388
I forgot my damn lunch.

09:51.423 --> 09:55.426
Do you wanna go back and get it?

09:55.460 --> 09:59.363
No, it's cool. Just drive.

10:11.326 --> 10:13.627
- You do all these by hand?
- Yes.

10:13.661 --> 10:15.646
Sir.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.315
I've seen so much digital work,

10:18.349 --> 10:21.418
it's refreshing to see something handmade.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.637
Uh, my friend Tank...
he's a football player...

10:23.671 --> 10:25.322
I got really inspired by his playbook.

10:25.356 --> 10:27.658
You know, all the "X"s and "O"s.

10:27.692 --> 10:30.227
See, that's great.

10:30.306 --> 10:32.708
So many applicants have the same backstory.

10:32.742 --> 10:36.344
They were outsiders. They found
themselves through their art.

10:36.362 --> 10:41.517
Whatever can make you
stand out is valuable.

10:41.551 --> 10:42.651
I was switched at birth.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.720
- Were you, really?
- True story.

10:44.754 --> 10:47.539
Well, that's something
that happened to you.

10:47.574 --> 10:50.292
I'm talking about things you do.

10:50.326 --> 10:52.427
I know sign language.

10:52.428 --> 10:55.428
A lot of our applicants are bilingual.

10:56.366 --> 10:59.601
I also, uh...

10:59.636 --> 11:01.369
play field hockey.

11:01.387 --> 11:03.238
No kidding.

11:03.273 --> 11:05.440
An artist who's also an athlete.

11:05.475 --> 11:09.211
You should definitely include
that in your application.

11:09.245 --> 11:11.280
It's those sort of activities

11:11.314 --> 11:13.482
that will really make you stand out.

11:18.421 --> 11:20.222
Very nice.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.526
<i>John: So, Jennice went
out to grab some lunch.</i>

11:24.561 --> 11:27.496
- Cool.
- You know, I was thinking, uh...

11:27.530 --> 11:30.332
Since Nikki's not coming
home for a couple of months,

11:30.366 --> 11:31.667
why not make this place your own?

11:31.701 --> 11:34.419
Embrace the single life?

11:34.454 --> 11:35.621
I'm not single.

11:35.672 --> 11:38.290
I know, but, you know,
bring your guitars over,

11:38.341 --> 11:40.459
stay up too late playing video games,

11:40.510 --> 11:42.544
leave your underwear everywhere. All that.

11:42.578 --> 11:44.412
Dad, I can't believe you're
still trying to convince me

11:44.464 --> 11:46.248
that I made a mistake marrying Nikki.

11:46.282 --> 11:49.251
- That's not what...
- Nikki and Jennice are family now.

11:49.285 --> 11:51.420
I need you to respect that.

11:51.454 --> 11:52.721
I do respect that, Toby.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.723
It's been difficult sometimes, but I do.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.291
Well, then what's this about?

11:56.326 --> 12:00.329
Nikki might not be coming
home when you think she is.

12:00.363 --> 12:02.397
What?

12:03.633 --> 12:04.666
(Exhales)

12:04.701 --> 12:06.602
She told Jennice that she's been asked

12:06.636 --> 12:08.203
to extend her stay.

12:09.472 --> 12:11.573
Well, she didn't tell me that.

12:13.643 --> 12:15.644
I think you need to talk to your wife.

12:18.481 --> 12:20.666
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

12:27.557 --> 12:30.659
This was a two-actor
adaptation of "Titus Andronicus"

12:30.693 --> 12:31.660
with live snakes.

12:31.694 --> 12:34.262
I jumped out of a pie.

12:34.297 --> 12:35.530
I can't believe we actually did that.

12:35.565 --> 12:37.633
And we weren't even paid.

12:37.667 --> 12:40.235
Renzo had no room for misery, though.

12:40.269 --> 12:41.503
<i>He was getting busy</i>

12:41.537 --> 12:43.338
with a hot delivery boy.

12:43.373 --> 12:45.240
He was not a delivery boy.

12:45.274 --> 12:46.508
He was a novelist

12:46.542 --> 12:47.609
and a delivery boy.

12:47.644 --> 12:48.677
<i>(Phone vibrates)</i>

12:48.711 --> 12:50.379
I directed a version of Shakespeare's...

12:50.413 --> 12:51.446
Oh, hold that thought.

12:51.481 --> 12:54.333
<i>Hello?</i>

12:54.367 --> 12:56.618
- Yeah...
- We've been here for 20 minutes.

12:56.653 --> 12:58.253
We're catching up.

12:58.287 --> 13:00.355
Aren't I supposed to be pitching my idea?

13:00.390 --> 13:01.624
Yeah, we're gonna get there.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.365
But she hates it when I push
my friends' book ideas on her.

13:04.803 --> 13:05.493
What am I doing here?

13:05.511 --> 13:09.197
Your idea is brilliant.
I'm getting to it, trust me.

13:09.232 --> 13:10.382
Thanks.

13:10.433 --> 13:11.383
Sorry about that.

13:13.236 --> 13:15.187
Okay, so guess what. Kathy here's a writer.

13:15.221 --> 13:17.272
And her two daughters
were switched at birth,

13:17.306 --> 13:18.640
and she wrote this really
incredible book about it,

13:18.675 --> 13:21.610
and it did really well. And
now she's got a new book idea.

13:21.644 --> 13:23.378
And I know you hate it when I do this,

13:23.413 --> 13:25.414
but this is a really great
idea, and you gotta hear it.

13:25.448 --> 13:28.283
(Sighs) Okay. I'm listening.

13:28.317 --> 13:31.353
I get so sick of urban ennui.

13:31.387 --> 13:33.205
Let's hear something Kansas.

13:33.239 --> 13:37.359
Okay. (Chuckles)

13:37.393 --> 13:39.461
Well, I just started
taking tap dancing lessons

13:39.495 --> 13:42.431
a couple weeks ago. And
that's where I met Renzo.

13:42.465 --> 13:44.499
And it was so invigorating.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.634
So here's my idea...

13:45.668 --> 13:48.603
I try 40 new things and I write about them.

13:48.638 --> 13:50.639
Parasailing, trout fishing,

13:50.673 --> 13:52.274
turkish baths.

13:52.308 --> 13:53.675
All kinds of exciting things.

13:53.710 --> 13:56.278
I have written up a treatment

13:56.312 --> 13:57.312
and a few sample chapters.

13:57.346 --> 13:59.481
- So...
- Adorable, charmed, love it.

13:59.515 --> 14:01.283
Just bought it from someone else.

14:01.317 --> 14:03.185
Really?

14:03.219 --> 14:04.519
Yeah.

14:04.587 --> 14:06.354
"Sporty in your 40s."

14:06.389 --> 14:09.257
Oh...

14:09.292 --> 14:11.393
Mine was "40 in your 40s."

14:11.427 --> 14:13.295
You got any other ideas?

14:13.329 --> 14:14.429
Well, I...

14:16.566 --> 14:18.333
nothing fleshed out.

14:18.367 --> 14:21.336
So I guess, um...

14:21.370 --> 14:23.238
this is it.

14:35.908 --> 14:36.974
Hey, there.

14:36.992 --> 14:39.010
My mom went out of town for the weekend,

14:39.044 --> 14:40.978
and she made enough lasagna for a month.

14:40.996 --> 14:42.080
No, thanks.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.750
You think I could borrow your car?

14:45.784 --> 14:47.652
What? No. Why?

14:47.686 --> 14:48.920
My mom... she didn't show up for work.

14:48.954 --> 14:49.954
Is everything okay?

14:49.988 --> 14:51.022
She isn't answering the phone.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.957
I gotta go look for her.

14:52.992 --> 14:53.931
I'm a really good driver,

14:53.932 --> 14:56.040
and I promise I'll be back
for practice this afternoon.

14:56.045 --> 14:57.762
I promise. Please?

15:07.606 --> 15:08.806
Thank you.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.915
Hey, Nik, it's me, uh, again.

15:16.949 --> 15:22.020
So, I guess just call me
back whenever you get this.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.788
Hey!

15:23.822 --> 15:25.690
Cool pad, bro.

15:26.742 --> 15:27.959
A cactus?

15:27.993 --> 15:30.578
It's a succulent.

15:30.629 --> 15:31.913
I don't really know what that means.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.999
It was between this or place-mats.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.035
You don't have to water it, like, ever.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.803
Thanks.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.877
Okay, here's the thing. I need...

15:45.911 --> 15:47.745
to get back on the field hockey team.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.715
- But you quit.
- Yes, I know.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.851
But I had a meeting with
a Pratt recruiter today,

15:53.886 --> 15:57.755
and it turns out I need to
diversify my extra-currics.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.923
No.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.593
You already backed off the team.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.760
I can't just put you back on.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.563
Your decisions affect other people.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.898
What are we talking about?

16:06.932 --> 16:09.901
Your team needed you, and you flaked out.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.736
<i>I know, but... (Sighs)</i>

16:11.770 --> 16:15.039
I thought I had to be all "art
or nothing," and I was wrong.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.977
I shouldn't have dropped out, I'm sorry.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.982
Please, I really really need this.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.650
(Sighs)

16:25.684 --> 16:27.685
We're running some drills this afternoon.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.987
You can fill in for goalie.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.856
Goalie?

16:31.890 --> 16:33.858
Isn't that a pretty prominent position?

16:33.892 --> 16:34.926
You sure you want me doing that?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.661
Well, Mindy wants a break.

16:36.695 --> 16:40.832
And if you can prove to me
that your heart is still in it,

16:40.866 --> 16:42.667
then I might let you back on the team.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.602
Ohh!

16:44.620 --> 16:46.604
You're the best.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.773
I promise I'll bring the heat.

16:48.791 --> 16:49.958
Whatever that means.

16:49.992 --> 16:53.661
Hey, why doesn't Mindy
want to be goalie anymore?

16:53.712 --> 16:56.303
Uh, she's tired of getting hit by balls.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.916
Uh, I don't want that either.

16:59.451 --> 17:03.220
Well, then maybe you should put in a
little practice before this afternoon.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.222
(Indistinct chatter)

17:07.125 --> 17:09.326
Thanks again for helping me out today.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.528
You're a really good friend.

17:10.561 --> 17:12.296
No prob. It's gonna be fun.

17:12.314 --> 17:14.464
Okay, so, take your place in the net.

17:14.499 --> 17:15.532
Pardon?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.351
(Chuckles) Okay.

17:17.402 --> 17:19.185
Here's what you're gonna block.

17:19.237 --> 17:20.237
From there to there.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.271
And imagine like a foot

17:21.306 --> 17:23.207
- above your head too.
- Okay.

17:23.241 --> 17:25.159
I got it.

17:25.193 --> 17:26.410
Ready?

17:26.444 --> 17:28.412
Ha! As I'll ever be.

17:28.445 --> 17:30.281
Ay.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.282
Okay... oh, sorry.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.167
Bad dodgeball memories.

17:33.201 --> 17:35.085
All right, first things first:

17:35.120 --> 17:37.204
You can't be scared of the
ball, or the ball will know.

17:37.255 --> 17:38.455
How will the ball know?

17:38.490 --> 17:41.125
Trust me, it'll know. Okay?

17:41.159 --> 17:43.210
So, remove the fear.

17:43.261 --> 17:44.545
Plus, you're gonna be
covered in so much padding.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.514
Imagine that you're wrapped in a mattress.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.350
Face the ball with fury.

17:49.384 --> 17:51.185
Okay, yeah, all right.

17:51.219 --> 17:52.269
I got it.

17:55.307 --> 17:56.507
Dude! Trickery!

17:56.541 --> 17:58.442
That is so not fair.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.195
That's lesson number
two. Reverse psychology.

18:01.229 --> 18:03.063
The player's probably
gonna try to fake you out.

18:03.114 --> 18:04.315
You have to keep your eye on their stick.

18:04.349 --> 18:06.083
It'll help you predict
where they're gonna go.

18:06.117 --> 18:07.517
Know the future... got it. Go again.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.454
No! Ooh! (Screams)

18:10.488 --> 18:13.290
- (Laughing) Nice one!
- I almost got it!

18:13.325 --> 18:14.358
That was beautiful.

18:16.494 --> 18:20.130
Hey, so, um, after the drills...

18:20.165 --> 18:22.132
Do you want to, like,
grab a little barbecue?

18:22.167 --> 18:23.200
Yeah, let's do it.

18:23.218 --> 18:24.368
All right.

18:27.572 --> 18:30.174
Okay, so, get gussied up.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.443
And I'll meet you in 20 minutes, okay?

18:32.477 --> 18:34.094
You know what? I think
I'm just gonna stay in.

18:34.145 --> 18:35.545
- I'm really tired, so...
- Very funny.

18:37.415 --> 18:38.382
You okay?

18:39.551 --> 18:41.551
It's just that we came all the way here

18:41.570 --> 18:44.188
to New York, and it was over in 30 seconds.

18:44.222 --> 18:46.407
You had one brilliant idea.

18:46.441 --> 18:48.192
You'll have another.

18:48.226 --> 18:49.526
What if I don't?

18:49.560 --> 18:54.198
The girls are gonna be gone
next year, Toby's moving out.

18:54.232 --> 18:57.117
What am I gonna do, spend the
rest of my life redecorating?

18:57.168 --> 18:59.103
Oh, honey.

18:59.137 --> 19:02.072
Okay, so, here's the plan.

19:02.107 --> 19:03.340
We are gonna freshen up,

19:03.375 --> 19:05.409
then we're gonna go downtown,
get you some Marc Jacobs heels

19:05.443 --> 19:07.127
you can barely walk in.

19:07.178 --> 19:10.347
And then we're gonna find out
exactly what a "cronut" is.

19:10.382 --> 19:14.151
And we're gonna meet Lydia and her
girlfriend, we're gonna have drinks.

19:14.185 --> 19:16.387
We are here, and we're gonna have fun.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.090
Yeah?

19:20.125 --> 19:21.425
Yes.

she didn't even talk to me about it.

she didn't wanna ruin it with bad news.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.571
It doesn't matter.

27:39.605 --> 27:42.874

- Which one?

- Who decided that they wanted to swap.
- Okay.

28:04.563 --> 28:06.698
So, they're out on the road,

28:06.732 --> 28:08.984

$800 dinners. You know?

28:09.035 --> 28:10.986
With the lobster and a side of steak.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.672
And they drink, not three,

28:13.706 --> 28:15.840
<i>- but four bottles of Château Lafite.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.676
- Want.
- Of course.

28:17.710 --> 28:18.977
Then they go back to their hotel,

28:19.011 --> 28:21.779
where they conveniently have
rooms right next to each other.

28:21.797 --> 28:22.914
And they swap.

28:22.948 --> 28:25.784
- (Gasps )
- Mm-hmm...

28:25.818 --> 28:29.587
But one of the players had
been dabbling in steroids,

28:29.621 --> 28:31.990
so when it came time to seal the deal,

28:32.024 --> 28:34.926
let's just say he wasn't
exactly batter's up.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.846
(All laugh)

28:37.897 --> 28:42.767
So the disappointed wife goes
next door to join the other couple.

But lo and behold, it turns out

28:44.737 --> 28:47.038

- What do you think?</i>

29:33.986 --> 29:35.620
(Daphne sighs)

29:37.573 --> 29:39.557
(Exhales) I don't see your car.

29:41.627 --> 29:42.861
That's her mom.

29:50.803 --> 29:51.770
Hi.

29:51.804 --> 29:54.606
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

29:54.640 --> 29:56.741
No, no problem. Can I help you?

29:56.776 --> 29:59.644
I'm Sharee's friend,
Daphne. This is my mom.

29:59.678 --> 30:00.645
Hi.

30:00.679 --> 30:03.047
Oh, yes, Daphne.

30:03.082 --> 30:05.850
The girl's who's been
driving my baby to school.

30:05.885 --> 30:08.586
I really appreciate that.

30:08.621 --> 30:11.923
Um, Daphne was just a
little worried about Sharee.

30:11.957 --> 30:14.743
So she wanted us to check in.

30:14.777 --> 30:17.896
Um, she missed her field
hockey practice today.

30:17.930 --> 30:21.666
She should be home soon.

30:21.700 --> 30:22.901
Y'all hungry?

30:24.036 --> 30:25.770
I'm making gumbo.

30:25.805 --> 30:27.939
It was just gonna be the two of us,

30:27.973 --> 30:29.808
but it'd be so much nicer with guests.

30:29.842 --> 30:33.745
Um, we just wanted to check in.

30:33.779 --> 30:35.747
Sharee never brings her friends over,

30:35.781 --> 30:38.049
and I always tell her that
she should, so I insist.

30:38.083 --> 30:39.784
Come on in, please. Please.

30:39.819 --> 30:41.019
I'm just gonna get the rest of these.

30:42.121 --> 30:43.822
Oh, here. Let me help.

30:43.856 --> 30:45.957
Oh, thank you.

30:45.991 --> 30:46.958
You're a gem.

30:48.694 --> 30:50.645
Thank you.

30:52.114 --> 30:54.098
Come in.

30:54.133 --> 30:56.868
I'm a cat lover, as you can see.

30:56.902 --> 30:58.837
(Kisses, meows)

31:00.606 --> 31:02.824
They're probably hiding. (Laughs)

31:02.875 --> 31:03.908
Don't mind them.

31:16.989 --> 31:20.008
Oh, s... sorry about the mess.

31:20.059 --> 31:23.928
I was just so sick of looking at that wall.

31:23.963 --> 31:26.964
I... I just needed some more room.

31:26.982 --> 31:28.900
<i>You know?</i>

31:28.934 --> 31:30.034
(All chuckle lightly)

31:30.069 --> 31:31.870
Why don't you all make yourselves at home?

31:31.904 --> 31:33.838
And just push all this stuff
aside, and we're gonna eat.

31:33.873 --> 31:34.939
Is something burning?

31:34.974 --> 31:37.008
Ohh...

31:37.042 --> 31:39.944
I left the broth on when I
went to get some more shrimp.

31:39.979 --> 31:41.045
Let me go check.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.046
Excuse me.

31:46.652 --> 31:48.620
She left the stove on?

31:54.165 --> 31:56.035
So, it's like "Real
housewives of baseball."

31:56.168 --> 31:58.703
Glamour meets smut meets sports.

31:58.737 --> 32:00.938
I know! It's fantastic.

32:00.973 --> 32:03.708
"Nine Innings of Grey." Totally.

32:03.742 --> 32:06.077
This is so exciting.

32:06.111 --> 32:07.912
This could be huge.

32:07.946 --> 32:09.113
First a book, then a movie.

32:09.147 --> 32:10.882
There could be dolls.

32:10.916 --> 32:13.184
- I haven't even said yes yet.
- Shh.

32:15.821 --> 32:17.789
(Gasps)

32:28.801 --> 32:30.735
What should we do?

32:30.769 --> 32:32.003
I'm not sure.

32:34.139 --> 32:36.007
What are you doing here?

32:36.041 --> 32:38.042
<i>- Where have you been?
- I'm really sorry.</i>

32:38.076 --> 32:40.812
I was just about to call you.

32:40.846 --> 32:43.114
Hey, baby. Dinner's almost ready.

32:43.148 --> 32:45.750
Mom, what the hell? Where
have you been all day?

32:45.784 --> 32:47.151
<i>I am fine.</i>

32:47.186 --> 32:50.121
I am making your grandma's gumbo.

32:50.155 --> 32:52.123
You can't just not show up for work.

32:52.157 --> 32:53.858
Your boss is really pissed.

32:53.892 --> 32:55.059
(Exhales)

32:55.093 --> 32:56.127
We should go.

32:56.161 --> 32:57.895
No! No.

32:57.930 --> 32:59.864
Please stay.

32:59.898 --> 33:01.833
I invited them to stay.

33:05.003 --> 33:06.804
Gumbo's almost ready.

33:06.839 --> 33:08.739
I just gotta finish shelling the crabs.

33:08.774 --> 33:10.141
<i>You know?</i>

33:10.175 --> 33:12.844
Working as... as fast as I can here.

33:14.847 --> 33:19.050
Maybe I should help?

33:19.084 --> 33:21.052
(Exhales)

33:21.086 --> 33:22.887
The more the merrier.

33:22.905 --> 33:25.055
(Chuckling)

33:25.073 --> 33:26.791
It's not what you think it is.

33:26.825 --> 33:28.910
I'm not even sure what I think this is.

33:28.944 --> 33:30.761
It's not like she's on
drugs or anything like that.

33:30.796 --> 33:32.063
What was the fight this morning?

33:32.097 --> 33:34.098
Her boyfriend left.

33:34.132 --> 33:36.834
He's a really good guy. He
just can't take it anymore.

33:36.869 --> 33:38.769
Take what?

33:38.804 --> 33:41.772
Sometimes she's up, sometimes she's down.

33:41.807 --> 33:43.140
Sometimes she's so down,
she tries to hurt herself,

33:43.208 --> 33:45.810
and I... I have to stop her.

33:45.844 --> 33:47.879
We should talk to someone.
Someone at Carlton.

33:47.913 --> 33:49.013
Hell no.

33:49.047 --> 33:51.015
I got it.

33:51.049 --> 33:52.183
If you wanna be a friend to me,

33:52.217 --> 33:53.751
you'll leave this alone.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.821
Promise you'll leave this alone.

34:02.995 --> 34:04.729
Hey, mom.

34:04.763 --> 34:06.898
Um, I just remembered
we said we'd have dinner

34:06.932 --> 34:08.833
with the Kennishes.

34:08.867 --> 34:12.003
Right.

34:12.036 --> 34:14.155
Maybe a rain check.

34:14.206 --> 34:16.841
Y'all are welcome here anytime.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.809
<i>You know, just come by anytime.</i>

34:21.163 --> 34:23.147
Aw, Sharee.

34:26.051 --> 34:29.754
These are good people here, Sharee.

34:29.788 --> 34:31.755
Yeah.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.181
<i>(Rock music playing loudly)</i>

34:54.830 --> 34:55.813
Hey.

34:55.831 --> 34:57.081
Hey.

34:57.114 --> 34:59.116
What are they doing?

34:59.150 --> 35:01.752
Um, don't mind them. They're idiots.

35:01.787 --> 35:03.120
- The very definition.
- Yeah.

35:03.155 --> 35:04.839
Are you having fun?

35:04.873 --> 35:05.856
Yeah.

35:07.059 --> 35:08.092
Can I talk to you for a second?

35:08.126 --> 35:09.927
Yeah, sure. Aren't we talking now?

35:13.966 --> 35:15.016
I don't know how to say this.

35:15.050 --> 35:16.767
Uh...

35:16.802 --> 35:17.885
So I'm just gonna say it.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.973
I see you as a friend.

35:22.007 --> 35:23.908
And... and that's it.

35:23.942 --> 35:25.042
And I... I just

35:25.077 --> 35:27.712
wanna make sure that I'm being clear.

35:27.746 --> 35:29.146
Yeah.

35:29.181 --> 35:31.065
No, totally. I can respect that.

35:31.116 --> 35:33.851
I think you're so great.

35:33.885 --> 35:35.920
I really do. I'm not just saying that.

35:35.954 --> 35:37.054
And I've never had a guy friend before.

35:37.089 --> 35:38.089
And you are just so...

35:38.123 --> 35:40.891
That's cool.

35:42.861 --> 35:44.128
Uh. (Chuckles)

35:44.162 --> 35:45.162
I think I should head out.

35:45.197 --> 35:47.164
Oh, no no. You don't have to go.

35:47.198 --> 35:49.199
No, it's... I got an exam tomorrow.

35:49.217 --> 35:51.135
I haven't started
studying for it yet, so...

35:51.169 --> 35:53.754
Hey, thanks for the invite.

35:55.173 --> 35:56.707
Tank, wait.

35:59.011 --> 36:00.711
(Groans)

36:00.729 --> 36:01.712
<i>Tank: Oh, my God, Bay.</i>

36:06.718 --> 36:07.952
Somebody call 9-1-1.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.075
- Come on. That's just not fair.
- Did you or did you not

36:13.120 --> 36:16.289
let your wife run off to
New York with another man?

36:16.323 --> 36:19.041
- A man who wears festive bowties.
- (Laughs)

36:19.092 --> 36:21.260
And like you're doing any better,

36:21.295 --> 36:24.096
hanging out with a guy who
cancels on you at the last minute?

36:24.131 --> 36:26.182
Come on, we gotta find you someone better.

36:26.216 --> 36:27.199
Trust me,

36:27.234 --> 36:28.267
there's no one left.

36:28.302 --> 36:30.002
All the good ones are taken.

36:30.037 --> 36:32.004
I'm sure that's not true.

36:34.041 --> 36:36.275
- Guess what.
- What?

36:36.310 --> 36:39.111
I saw you play once back in the day.

36:39.146 --> 36:40.980
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

36:41.014 --> 36:44.016
This was '91?

36:44.034 --> 36:45.117
A Rangers game.

36:45.152 --> 36:47.203
I drove down to Texas to see a friend,

36:47.237 --> 36:50.423
and we caught a game.

36:50.457 --> 36:53.242
You were incredible.

36:55.195 --> 36:57.330
Yeah.

36:57.364 --> 36:59.999
Can't play like that anymore.

37:00.033 --> 37:02.001
I bet it's still in there somewhere.

37:04.137 --> 37:05.104
Ahh.

37:05.138 --> 37:06.205
Nope.

37:06.239 --> 37:07.273
All washed up.

37:07.307 --> 37:09.275
Oh, come on.

37:09.309 --> 37:10.943
Seriously.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.179
So washed up in fact,

37:13.213 --> 37:16.248
that the Republican committee

37:16.283 --> 37:18.351
decided in their infinite wisdom

37:18.385 --> 37:22.355
to disinvite me from
Nashville this weekend.

37:22.389 --> 37:26.092
Seems a wife needed a seat
on Senator Rue's plane.

37:26.126 --> 37:28.260
(Chuckles)

37:28.295 --> 37:31.430
"John, do you mind hopping
a commercial flight?

37:31.465 --> 37:34.066
Surely you understand."

37:35.369 --> 37:36.969
Well, screw them.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.305
Yeah.

37:42.092 --> 37:44.076
<i>(Phone rings)</i>

37:47.464 --> 37:49.131
Hey, Wes.

37:49.182 --> 37:50.983
No no, it's not too late.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.052
I'm here for you. What do you need?

37:53.086 --> 37:55.154
What's that quote? Uh...

37:55.188 --> 37:58.324
"I don't wanna be a part of any
club that would have me as a member."

37:58.358 --> 38:01.160
Who said that?

38:01.194 --> 38:03.262
Somebody definitely said that.

38:03.296 --> 38:04.263
(Both chuckling)

38:04.297 --> 38:06.098
Somebody?

38:06.133 --> 38:07.199
Well, that's real helpful.

38:07.234 --> 38:09.201
Well, you're very welcome.

38:13.974 --> 38:17.376
<i>Honestly, it makes sense
to me that they're...</i>

38:22.315 --> 38:24.417
Oh, no. I'm here.

38:29.306 --> 38:30.389
I'm... I'm so sorry.

38:30.424 --> 38:32.058
No, me too. I...

38:32.092 --> 38:33.309
uh.

38:33.343 --> 38:34.310
I should go.

38:37.013 --> 38:38.097
I'm...

38:38.131 --> 38:40.066
<i>- have a good night.
- Yeah, y...</i>

38:40.100 --> 38:42.068
I...

38:42.102 --> 38:44.070
<i>(door opens, closes)</i>

38:53.013 --> 38:54.046
<i>Hey.</i>

38:54.081 --> 38:55.347
I thought you were right behind me.

38:55.382 --> 38:57.950
Oh, uh, sorry.

38:57.984 --> 39:02.254
I had to take a call from Wes.

39:02.289 --> 39:06.092
I heated up some of Kathryn's
lasagna if you're hungry.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.160
I gotta go finish my civ paper.

39:08.195 --> 39:09.995
Daphne, wait.

39:10.058 --> 39:14.044
We need to talk about Sharee.

39:14.079 --> 39:17.264
But I promised I wouldn't say anything.

39:17.315 --> 39:19.266
I don't think that's an option.

39:22.087 --> 39:24.054
Well, you were right, okay?

39:24.089 --> 39:25.456
I should have kept my distance.

39:25.490 --> 39:28.092
You told me you saw a bruise.

39:28.126 --> 39:32.363
She said it was from trying to
stop her mom from hurting herself.

39:32.397 --> 39:35.299
Honey, no kid should ever have to deal

39:35.333 --> 39:36.433
with that all by herself.

39:36.468 --> 39:39.136
Her mom is mentally ill.

39:39.171 --> 39:41.071
I don't know with what.

39:41.106 --> 39:43.073
But she's not well.

39:44.476 --> 39:45.442
Sharee needs help.

39:47.445 --> 39:49.446
She said she could handle it.

39:51.283 --> 39:53.050
This is not our business.

39:53.084 --> 39:55.152
Uh, when you started drinking again,

39:55.187 --> 39:57.137
would you have wanted
other people to butt in?

39:57.189 --> 40:00.090
If you had asked me a few years back,

40:00.092 --> 40:01.058
I would say you're right.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.195
But honestly,

40:04.229 --> 40:07.198
when Bay didn't mind her own business,

40:07.232 --> 40:08.332
she saved my life.

40:14.306 --> 40:15.406
But I promised.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.292
I know, I know.

40:21.213 --> 40:25.049
You are trying to do.

40:25.083 --> 40:27.484
But sometimes...

40:27.519 --> 40:30.421
promises need to be broken.

40:35.293 --> 40:36.493
Will you help me make the call?

40:36.528 --> 40:38.362
Oh, of course.

40:38.396 --> 40:40.347
Of course.

40:43.168 --> 40:44.468
(Sighs)

40:44.502 --> 40:47.471
Oh, uh, nothing much.

40:47.489 --> 40:49.106
You know, uh, just,

40:49.140 --> 40:51.108
uh, hung out, watched the fight.

40:51.142 --> 40:53.077
What about you?

40:53.111 --> 40:54.178
<i>What did you do tonight?</i>

40:54.212 --> 40:55.479
I sold a book idea.

40:55.497 --> 40:58.198
<i>- We're here, uh, celebrating.
- Oh, great.</i>

40:58.250 --> 41:00.317
<i>- I wanna hear all about it.
- Okay.</i>

41:00.335 --> 41:03.170
Well, um, it's a... kind of a...

41:03.204 --> 41:04.171
Oh, sweetie, hold on.

41:06.258 --> 41:07.224
Oh, can I call you right back?

41:07.259 --> 41:08.225
That's Toby on the other line.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.226
<i>Sure.</i>

41:09.261 --> 41:11.328
Bye.

41:11.363 --> 41:14.048
Yeah.

41:14.099 --> 41:16.333
What? Where is she?

41:20.188 --> 41:22.273
<i>Toby: Okay, dad's on his way.</i>

41:25.110 --> 41:27.177
Just sit tight, okay? I got you.

41:27.212 --> 41:28.245
Want some water or anything?

41:28.280 --> 41:30.514
I... I don't know.

41:30.548 --> 41:33.150
You did some job on this, huh?

41:33.184 --> 41:36.287
Should I be, like, freaking out right now?

41:40.458 --> 41:43.127
Uh, once we get you stitched
up, you should be okay.

41:43.161 --> 41:45.129
Yeah, absolutely.

41:45.163 --> 41:46.430

41:51.169 --> 41:52.436
I'm really glad you're here.

41:52.470 --> 41:54.505
Yeah, of course.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.094
You sure you don't want
some water or anything?

42:00.145 --> 42:02.012
Or like a really sincere hug?

42:02.047 --> 42:04.014
(Chuckles) I think I'm good, thanks.

42:04.049 --> 42:05.082
Can I get a high five?

42:05.116 --> 42:06.150
(Laughs)

42:06.184 --> 42:07.318
Ow.

42:07.352 --> 42:09.019
Aw, look at you...

42:09.054 --> 42:10.154
