WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.546
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.630 --> 00:08.300
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.383 --> 00:11.470
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.553 --> 00:14.598
On which we used to rely?

00:14.681 --> 00:17.893
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:17.976 --> 00:21.480
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.563 --> 00:23.065
All the things
that make us

00:23.148 --> 00:24.608
Laugh and cry

00:24.691 --> 00:29.863
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:35.035 --> 00:37.120
-Peter, did you brush your teeth?
-Nah.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.997
-Peter, brush your teeth.
-I don't wanna.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.374
Peter, brush your teeth.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.750
No, it's stupid.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.961
Well, I guess
we're gonna have to do this the hard way.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.128
No!
Open your mouth.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.505
No! No!
Peter, open your mouth!

00:46.588 --> 00:48.215
-(screaming) Show me your teeth!
-Show me your teeth!

00:48.298 --> 00:50.592
(glass shattering)
Peter, did you hear that?

00:57.641 --> 01:00.269
Oh, my God, there are men
breaking into our house.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.895
Dad, what is it?
What's going on?

01:01.979 --> 01:03.105
I heard a noise.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.315
Is somebody downstairs?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.442
Oh, God, Meg, you startled me.
I'm sorry.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.570
What the hell's your problem,
you dumbass?

01:09.653 --> 01:11.154
What the deuce
is all the commotion?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.865
Quick,
everyone get in the attic.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.663
Peter, what is that?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.540
Well, I got the idea
to build a panic room

01:21.623 --> 01:24.042
after I saw that movie,
The Butterfly Effect.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.211
I thought,
"Wow, this is terrible.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.671
"I wish I could escape
to a place

01:27.754 --> 01:29.464
where this movie
couldn't find me,"

01:29.548 --> 01:31.842
-and then-- What the hell
-are we waiting for?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.638
These monitors
are for watching the house.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.391
See, there's
Stewie's room, Chris' room, Meg's room...

01:39.474 --> 01:40.601
Peter,
there's no phone in here.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.727
How are we
gonna call the police?

01:41.810 --> 01:43.312
Oh, my God.
We're all gonna die!

01:43.395 --> 01:44.646
That's not true.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.440
We'll survive by
eating each other.

01:46.523 --> 01:50.319
But I think it's important for the last
one of us left alive to know this story.

01:50.402 --> 01:53.447
The story
of the Griffin family history.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.823
Here's how it all began.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.367
Everything started
with the Big Bang.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.785
It was a Saturday night,

01:58.869 --> 02:01.205
and God
and his roommate Chugs were arm wrestling.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.707
(chuckling) You're
going down, man.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.125
(farts)

02:05.209 --> 02:07.377
Oh, dude, that is sick.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.421
Yeah! Undefeated!

02:09.505 --> 02:13.634
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Here--Here comes
another one. Quick, give me your lighter.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.885
(loud bang)

02:19.556 --> 02:23.519
Then, over millions of years,
evolution took its course.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.779
Of course, I'm obligated
by the state of Kansas

02:33.862 --> 02:37.574
to present the church's alternative
to the theory of evolution.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.869
(theme from
I Dream of Jeannie playing)

02:51.547 --> 02:53.465
After that,
a meteor hit the earth,

02:53.549 --> 02:55.717
turning it
into a block of ice for some reason.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.637
But then it thawed
and cavemen came.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.474
Why Peter look sad?

03:02.558 --> 03:05.978
Brian, Peter invent wheel.
Peter show wheel to people in town,

03:06.061 --> 03:07.271
but no one want wheel.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.314
Everyone excited
about trapezoid.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.524
No one buy wheel.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.067
Peter, you invent wheel?

03:12.150 --> 03:13.402
That big breakthrough.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.736
This maybe
make you millionaire.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.030
Then how come no
one buy Peter wheel?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.782
Maybe sales pitch
not good enough.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.033
Brian help.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.454
Okay, sell wheel
just like practice.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.706
Not sure can do it.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.749
You so money.
Don't know it.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.126
Hi, me Peter.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.961
Tired walking everyplace?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.296
Need something make you go?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.214
Peter wheel make you go.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.550
Maybe Joe
want try wheel on chair.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.594
For last time, Joe no want.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.470
(screaming)

03:42.222 --> 03:44.183
Brian, Peter fail again.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.436
Not so fast.
Brian have other idea.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.522
Anyone buy
wheel get dead bird.

03:50.606 --> 03:51.857
(all mumbling)

03:51.940 --> 03:54.026
Not working.
Try drastic measure.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.111
Brian, what hell?

03:56.195 --> 03:57.321
Hot lady next to wheel.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.864
Make me want wheel.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.409
Maybe if me buy wheel,
me get pretty lady, too. I buy wheel.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.536
(all clamoring)

04:04.620 --> 04:07.539
People want Peter wheel
thanks to sexy wife.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.459
Tonight you and me
party like it's 9.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.713
Damn all. What deuce?
Victory Stewie's.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.716
There have been
many great Griffins throughout history,

04:17.799 --> 04:20.969
including Moses Griffin,
who led the Jews out of Egypt.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.390
All right, it's gonna be
a long journey, everyone,

04:25.474 --> 04:27.309
but I will lead you
to freedom.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.770
Now, Jews, ho!

04:33.482 --> 04:35.400
Here we are, the Red Sea.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.319
Now, all we gotta do
is swim across.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.403
I didn't bring
my trunks.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.239
I don't want
to step on a shell.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.990
I can't get water
in my ears.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.200
I ate 20 minutes ago.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.328
You know, what they flush
in Cairo ends up right here.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.206
(sighs) All right,
I'll see what I can do.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.799
MAN #1: Oh,
I can part the Red Sea.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.677
You know he hasn't
talked to his brother in three years?

05:03.512 --> 05:04.972
All right, listen up.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.766
Before we go any further,
I'm gonna lay down a few rules, all right?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.977
Commandment Number One:
Shut the hell up.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.522
Commandment Number Two:
There's nothing I can do about the sun.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.815
Commandment Number Three:

05:14.898 --> 05:17.651
There are
no more Jolly Ranchers, they're all gone.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.194
Commandment Number Four:

05:19.278 --> 05:22.322
When we pass a billboard,
please don't read it out loud, all right?

05:22.406 --> 05:23.740
Now, come on,
let's get going.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.245
MAN #1:
Ooh, look at that.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.205
"Danny Gans,
Entertainer of the Year."

05:30.289 --> 05:31.665
What did I say?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
MAN #2: "Hassle-free checking."
MOSES: Damn it!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.587
-MAN #3: "Mancow in the morning."
-Shut up!

05:36.670 --> 05:38.714
Peter,
can we stop the stories for a minute?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.966
We need to figure out
how we're gonna survive.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.718
I mean, is there
even any food in here?

05:42.801 --> 05:44.219
Right, good thinking.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.554
Meg,
go get us some sandwiches.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.847
Wait a minute,
that's a great idea.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.432
If Meg
can get through the vent,

05:48.515 --> 05:49.558
she can sneak out
and go get help.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.351
Dad,
I can't go through the vent.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.104
Yeah, she's right. We need
to grease her up so she doesn't get stuck.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.480
Everybody, spit on Meg.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.567
Stop! Stop! Ah!
Stop! Okay, okay!

05:58.650 --> 06:01.570
I meant I can't do it
because there are burglars down there.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.113
Come on,
they're not gonna touch you.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.239
You're covered with spit.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.908
Be careful, Meg.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.243
(Meg screaming)

06:08.327 --> 06:09.745
I hate you all!

06:09.828 --> 06:11.413
Hey, I hate you too, bitch.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.624
Oh, no, no, I'm just kidding.
Can you imagine?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.589
You think Meg
made it through the vent?

06:20.672 --> 06:22.049
Well, let's find out.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.469
Oh, there she is.
She's in the kitchen.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.472
Hey, Meg. I see you
there in the kitchen.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.557
Put my sandwich
on whole wheat, please.

06:30.641 --> 06:31.975
No, no, no, no,
don't--don't use that mustard.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.435
Use the other mustard.

06:33.519 --> 06:34.895
Oh, God, Meg,
they know you're there.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.271
Quick,
scrape that mustard off.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.481
Use the other mustard!

06:37.564 --> 06:41.527
Oh, no.
The burglars got my baby.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.238
I think they're making a sign
to tell us something.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.574
Better not be
using my crayons, mixing them up.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.744
"We have your son."

06:50.827 --> 06:52.663
Meg's our daughter.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.376
Peter, do something!

06:57.459 --> 07:01.547
You know, Meg being captured
by evil men reminds me of another story.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.173
It's distracting.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.134
Um, this is the story
of my ancestor Nate Griffin.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.512
Of course,
Nate Griffin was his slave name.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.681
His real name
was Richard Bachman.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.433
And this
is the story of his roots.

07:13.517 --> 07:18.355
It all began in Africa
in the tiny village of Quahogswana

07:18.438 --> 07:21.942
where he was a proud member
of the tribe of Tootie-and-Blair.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.361
Hey, Quagdingo,
how was your date last night?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.114
Oh, it was awesome. You never feel
as big as you do with a pygmy.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.492
Hey, you guys
wanna go get a drink at Club 227?

07:30.576 --> 07:31.702
Not today, Joemama.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.912
I'm going off to find
a log to build a drum,

07:33.996 --> 07:36.206
so I can play
the opening part from Hot For Teacher.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.374
I'll see you guys later.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.584
Coming up in this half hour,

07:38.667 --> 07:41.420
flies on your face:
how many is too many?

07:41.503 --> 07:42.921
But first,
that orange thing in the sky

07:43.005 --> 07:44.882
and what you can do
to please it.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.638
You know, you shouldn't be
poking around out here.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.140
White men
have been spotted nearby,

07:53.223 --> 07:57.269
laying traps and forming
slo-pitch softball leagues.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.687
Well,
whatever makes them happy.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.731
Live and let live,
that's what I say.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.399
And I'm sure
that's what they say, too.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.694
Hello. I'm Cleveland
from South Carolina.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.487
Wow, you're
a different color than me.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.156
Would you like to be equals?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.415
-Hey, you wanna play I Spy again?
-No!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.459
I spy something beige.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.002
Wood.
Yeah.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.713
Hello and welcome to the news
at what I suspect is dawn.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.548
Our top story
continues to be,

08:26.632 --> 08:28.717
where is this
giant canoe heading?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.093
But first,
let's go to Ollie Williams

08:30.177 --> 08:32.137
with
the portside window report.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.514
Ollie?
I saw a fish!

08:33.597 --> 08:35.015
Thanks, Ollie.
And now, sleep.

08:35.098 --> 08:36.266
(both snoring)

08:42.689 --> 08:44.733
Hey, guys,
one of my cuffs is loose.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.027
If we can break out of here,
I've got an idea

08:47.110 --> 08:50.364
how to give
the captain of this boat what he deserves.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.491
(door creaking)

08:57.538 --> 08:58.789
Hey, where's the captain?

08:58.872 --> 09:01.542
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all morning.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.711
Are you ready
for the summer?

09:04.795 --> 09:07.589
Are you ready
for the sunshine?

09:07.673 --> 09:09.216
Are you ready for...

09:09.299 --> 09:10.509
(all cheering)

09:10.592 --> 09:11.718
You dirty...

09:12.886 --> 09:17.307
(laughing) This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.309
And it was.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.437
But Nate soon found himself
put to work on a Southern plantation.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.981
It was way down there.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.232
You know,
where you stop seeing Howard Johnsons

09:25.315 --> 09:26.733
and you start
seeing Stuckey's.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.360
Anyway,
it was a horrible place

09:28.443 --> 09:30.362
where they took away
everybody's African names

09:30.445 --> 09:32.406
and gave them new names.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.575
What's your name?

09:34.658 --> 09:35.993
Tobi with an "I."

09:36.076 --> 09:38.912
With an accent over the "I,"
and a little line over the "O,"

09:38.996 --> 09:42.040
so you know it's a long vowel sound
and not a short one.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.834
And sometimes
I like to dot the "I"

09:43.917 --> 09:46.670
with a little smiley face
or a heart or something.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.672
Something
to brighten the reader's day.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.174
I asked you
what your name was.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.677
Honey, you keep that up,
it's whatever you want it to be.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.053
Of course,
back then, the South

09:55.137 --> 09:57.723
was a very different place
than it is today.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.892
A backward place
where they didn't believe in science

09:59.975 --> 10:02.102
and hated others
just for being different.

10:02.186 --> 10:05.022
Time has a way
of changing a place and its people.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.524
Uh, excuse me.
Hi. Yeah, is--is there, like,

10:07.608 --> 10:09.902
a human resources guy
we could talk to?

10:09.985 --> 10:13.113
-Um, I have a work-related grievance.
-What?

10:13.197 --> 10:15.908
Yeah, the quarters are too crowded,
the hours are long,

10:15.991 --> 10:19.203
and, uh, you know,
I don't like to be "this guy,"

10:19.286 --> 10:23.874
but a couple of the overseers
have been making racial slurs.

10:26.919 --> 10:29.755
And then,
all of a sudden, he saw her.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.216
Lois Laura Bush
Lynne Cheney Pewterschmidt,

10:32.299 --> 10:34.259
the plantation
owner's daughter.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.638
Of course, ordinarily, black guys
aren'tattracted to white women,

10:37.721 --> 10:39.264
but she
was something different.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.100
As a poet might say,
she was the kind of woman

10:42.184 --> 10:44.645
you just want to have sex with
over and over.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.898
With the kind of breasts
you just wanna push together

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
so she looks
like a cross-eyed torso.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.611
He knew he had to have her.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.991
(stones tapping)

11:02.704 --> 11:04.081
(neighing)

11:09.294 --> 11:10.504
Is someone there?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.256
Lois!
Who are you?

11:12.339 --> 11:13.674
Hi. I'm Nate Griffin.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.175
I work against my will
for your dad.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.219
Oh, yeah?
Well, what do you do?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.638
Well, let's just say
I know my way around a hoe.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.057
(both chuckling)

11:22.140 --> 11:26.186
And from the moment that piece of
off-color blue comedy was uttered,

11:26.270 --> 11:28.355
their lives
were changed forever.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.567
-You wanna do it? You bet
-your sweet black ass I do.

11:31.650 --> 11:36.154
So for the next 15 years,
they raised a family in secrecy.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.074
Supper's ready!
Come and get it, kids!

11:39.157 --> 11:42.077
You know the best part
about being half-black and half-white?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.997
When I grow up, I'll be
accepted by everybody.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.415
A-ha!

11:46.498 --> 11:47.583
(gasps) Daddy!

11:47.666 --> 11:48.917
Just as I thought!

11:49.001 --> 11:51.920
Lois, how in God's name
could you embarrass the family like this?

11:52.004 --> 11:54.590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sitting right here.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.550
Daddy,
you're the embarrassment.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.759
Nate and I love each other!

11:57.843 --> 12:00.888
Tell it to the authorities,
because you're all going to jail!

12:01.805 --> 12:03.974
Run!

12:04.057 --> 12:06.476
And so they set off on
their escape to the North.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.438
Luckily, they were helped
by Nate's good friend, Al Cowlings,

12:09.521 --> 12:11.982
who showed up
on his trusty white bronco.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.276
But the law
was hot on their trail.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.741
Well, we're getting a good view
of the chase from up here, Tom.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.994
That's right, Diane. We're looking at
Nate Griffin and Al Cowlings,

12:24.077 --> 12:25.579
the man we believe
to be Al Cowlings.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.080
We'll stay with the chase.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.416
Um, it seems like
a futile effort on their part, Diane.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.211
At some point, that horse is going to have
to stop and eat some grain.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.879
But luck
was on their side

12:33.962 --> 12:36.256
and eventually,
they made it to the North.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.966
After that,
Nate devoted his life

12:38.050 --> 12:39.218
to getting back
at the white man

12:39.301 --> 12:41.053
for the injustice of slavery

12:41.136 --> 12:43.764
by inventing the
Department of Motor Vehicles.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.183
-Sir, did you fill out the 1170?
-I think I did.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.519
Did you fill out the 1170?
I filled this out.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.063
That's the 1190. You're gonna have
to go stand in the blue line.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.272
Look,
I was already in that line.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.398
Sir,
don't get snippy with me.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.858
What?
I've been here all morning.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.193
That is not my prerogative,
sir.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.778
I-I wait in one line,
they send me to another line...

12:57.861 --> 12:59.696
You know what? You can always call
to make an appointment.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.822
I tried to call!
I can't get through.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.074
The line's always busy!
It's ridiculous.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.408
You can go wait
in the appointment line, then.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.910
I know! I don't wanna wait!
Sir, I can't help you.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.161
(indistinct arguing)

13:06.245 --> 13:07.579
You're gonna have to take
that somewhere else.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.122
-It shouldn't be this hard!
-You know what? I'm on break.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.916
Peter, enough
with the storytelling.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.168
We gotta get outta here!
They're gonna kill Meg!

13:13.252 --> 13:16.088
Oh, yeah?
Over Meg's dead body.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.550
Hey! A flare gun.
Good idea, Peter.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.968
If we angle it
through the vent,

13:21.051 --> 13:22.719
we might be able
to alert the authorities.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.849
Oh, my God!
We're gonna drown!

13:26.932 --> 13:28.684
We'll be fine.
Here, put these on.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.102
Peter, these are parachutes.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.145
What are we
supposed to do with these?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.647
They're supposed
to distract you

13:33.730 --> 13:35.566
while I put on
the one scuba suit.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.994
(coughing)

13:47.077 --> 13:48.120
What's the matter?

13:48.203 --> 13:49.329
That wasn't oxygen.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.373
That was a tank
of Tony Danza's breath.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.292
I wonder
who got my oxygen tank.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.711
Kiss me, Tony.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.255
I want your breath inside me.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.841
(inhaling)

14:00.924 --> 14:01.967
Hey!

14:02.050 --> 14:04.178
Well, as long as death
is staring us in the face,

14:04.261 --> 14:06.680
I might as well tell you
about my great-grandfather,

14:06.763 --> 14:10.017
who was the greatest
silent movie star of the '20s.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.644
His name was
Willie "Black-Eye" Griffin,

14:12.728 --> 14:16.148
and his ocular misadventures
made him a star.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.153
(music playing)

15:19.503 --> 15:20.546
(no dialogue)

15:38.272 --> 15:39.690
"Black-Eye" Griffin
and his family

15:39.773 --> 15:41.733
were among
the wealthiest people in Hollywood.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.820
They spent their idle time
cavorting, doing the Charleston,

15:44.903 --> 15:48.073
and enjoying America's prosperity
following World War I,

15:48.156 --> 15:51.451
which, at that time,
was called International Civil War II.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.662
But the golden years
soon ended.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.581
Sadly,
"Black-Eye" Griffin's voice

15:55.664 --> 15:57.916
just wasn't right
for the talking pictures.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.463
Pardon me, madam.
I'm the truant officer.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.466
I found these two children of yours
playing hooky from school.

16:06.550 --> 16:10.387
Oh, my!
This will never do, will it, dear?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.556
(babbling) Chris, you gotta...
You gotta...

16:12.639 --> 16:14.892
It's important for you
to get an education!

16:14.975 --> 16:17.519
Get in there
and finish your homework!

16:17.603 --> 16:20.731
It was a simpler time.
It was a better time.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.526
Well, no matter what happens to us,
I just hope Meg's okay.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.946
So, is...
Is this, like, the part

16:28.030 --> 16:30.157
-where you guys have your way with me?
-What?

16:30.240 --> 16:31.992
You know,
where I'm, like, helpless,

16:32.075 --> 16:34.286
and you guys take turns.
You know?

16:34.369 --> 16:38.081
Oh, no!
Oh, God! Oh, no, no, no, no!

16:38.165 --> 16:39.333
BURGLAR: What did she say?

16:39.416 --> 16:41.293
She asked
if we were gonna have our way with her.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.837
-Ew!
-Seriously. I won't scream or anything.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.632
No!
No! I... I... No. No sale.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.883
Come on! I'm pretty!

16:47.966 --> 16:49.176
(screaming)

16:49.927 --> 16:51.094
(panting)

16:51.178 --> 16:52.346
Are you okay?

16:52.429 --> 16:54.264
Yeah. I was so scared.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.558
Well, it sure would suck
if you guys died

16:56.642 --> 16:59.186
without hearing the story
of my great-uncle, Peter Hitler,

16:59.269 --> 17:00.687
who was Adolf's
favorite brother.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.108
Hey, there you are.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.986
Hey, you ready to go check out that
new skin flick over at the Boobengarden?

17:08.070 --> 17:09.780
Peter,
can't you see I'm busy?

17:09.863 --> 17:11.156
Yeah? What are you doing?

17:11.240 --> 17:13.450
Stuff?
Yes.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.785
Nazi stuff?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.745
Yes, Peter. Nazi stuff.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.163
Can I help?

17:18.247 --> 17:19.998
No, Peter.
Just let me work, all right?

17:20.082 --> 17:22.334
All right, all right.
Okay. All right.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.170
(sputtering)

17:32.177 --> 17:33.846
Hey. Hey, Addy. Addy, look.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.097
Addy, I'm Tojo.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.766
Addy. Addy, look.
I'm... See, look. I'm Tojo.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.644
(humming)

17:40.727 --> 17:41.979
I am from Japan.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.230
(imitating gong)

17:43.313 --> 17:44.690
(groans)

17:44.982 --> 17:46.608
(exclaims)

17:46.692 --> 17:47.818
Sweet!

17:47.901 --> 17:51.655
(imitating gunfire)

17:53.115 --> 17:54.992
That's what
a gun sounds like.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.159
Will you stop that?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.744
Hey, can I borrow 50 Marks?

17:57.828 --> 18:00.455
Oh, what happened
to the 50 Marks I gave you last week?

18:00.539 --> 18:02.457
Oh, come on.
Your girlfriend's not cheap.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.501
Ooh! (chuckling)

18:04.585 --> 18:07.212
Just kidding.
Oh, look at your face.

18:07.296 --> 18:08.964
Hey, whatever happened
with that art school?

18:09.047 --> 18:10.507
You ever gonna
take another crack at that?

18:10.591 --> 18:12.050
Look,
I'm going to do a rally.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.927
I'll be back in an hour.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.221
A rally? Sweet.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.223
(crowd cheering)

18:18.307 --> 18:21.185
The days of despair
and hardship are over!

18:21.268 --> 18:23.854
Today begins a new order!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.898
All of Europe will tremble

18:25.981 --> 18:29.860
as Germany takes its rightful place
as ruler of the world!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.028
Oh, yeah!

18:31.111 --> 18:35.199
Yes. As I was saying,
the time for victory is upon us!

18:35.282 --> 18:37.659
Victory up the ass, baby!
Yeah, come on!

18:37.743 --> 18:41.038
A new-- A new world!
A better world!

18:41.121 --> 18:42.789
A German world!

18:42.873 --> 18:47.127
Yeah! Germanator!
I'll be back! Whoo! Yeah!

18:47.211 --> 18:49.671
We will emerge
as the dominant people!

18:49.755 --> 18:51.715
And it's all
'cause of you guys. You know what?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.593
You guys, with your marching,
and your letters, and your phone calls...

18:54.676 --> 18:56.595
This--This is
all thanks to you.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.722
You--You made this happen,
you guys.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.015
You know... My God.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.225
Give yourselves
a round of applause.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.685
Come on. You deserve it.
You deserve it.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.398
Hey, what do you say
we all head over to the Boozenpuken, eh?

19:08.482 --> 19:11.693
Free beer
on this motherfuhrer! Eh? Come on!

19:11.777 --> 19:13.529
(all cheering)

19:13.612 --> 19:16.240
Well, that's pretty much
all there is to tell, kids.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.368
The Griffin family history
is a rich tapestry.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.994
But since
we're all gonna die,

19:21.078 --> 19:24.456
there's one more secret
I feel I have to share with you.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.459
-I did not care for The Godfather.
-What?

19:27.543 --> 19:29.169
Did not care
for The Godfather.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.587
How can you
even say that, Dad?

19:30.671 --> 19:31.922
Didn't like...
Didn't like it.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.341
Peter, it's so good.
It--It's like the perfect movie.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.510
This is what everyone
always says whenever...

19:36.593 --> 19:38.554
Robert De Niro,
Al Pacino...

19:38.637 --> 19:41.348
I mean, you never see...
Robert Duvall!

19:41.431 --> 19:43.183
(stuttering) I know.
Fine, fine actor.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.393
Did not like the movie.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.228
-Why not? Did not...
-Couldn't get into it.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.230
Explain yourself.
What didn't you like about it?

19:48.313 --> 19:50.315
-It--It insists upon itself, Lois.
-What?

19:50.399 --> 19:52.401
It insists upon itself.
What does that even mean?

19:52.484 --> 19:55.028
'Cause it has
a valid point to make, it's insistent!

19:55.112 --> 19:57.406
It takes forever getting in,
and then you spend, you know,

19:57.489 --> 19:59.032
like six-and-a-half hours,
and then, you know,

19:59.116 --> 20:01.034
I can't even get through it.
I can't even finish the movie.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.453
-I've never even seen the ending.
-You've never seen the ending?

20:03.537 --> 20:04.663
Well, how can you say
you don't like it

20:04.746 --> 20:06.582
if you haven't
even given it a chance?

20:06.665 --> 20:08.917
-I agree with Stewie. It's not fair.
-It's outrageous.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.628
I have tried on three separate occasions
to get through it,

20:11.712 --> 20:12.796
and I... I get to the scene
where all the guys

20:12.880 --> 20:14.506
are sitting around
on the easy chairs...

20:14.590 --> 20:17.301
-That's a great scene. I love that scene.
-It's noted in every annal.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.844
I have no idea
what they're talking about.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.470
It's like they're speaking
a different language.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.098
-That's where I lose interest and go away.
-They're speaking Italian!

20:23.182 --> 20:25.309
The language they're speaking
is the language of subtlety,

20:25.392 --> 20:26.810
something
you don't understand.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.353
I love The Money Pit.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.230
That is my answer
to that statement.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.274
Exactly.
Well, there you go.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.526
Whatever.
I like that movie, too.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.280
Thank God
you guys are okay!

20:38.363 --> 20:41.033
Wow! You saved our lives,
Mr. Swanson!

20:41.116 --> 20:42.326
We've captured the burglars.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.744
Oh, thank God.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.914
Unfortunately,
they're pressing sexual harassment charges

20:46.997 --> 20:47.998
against your daughter.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.750
Well, that was a close call.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.834
You know...

20:50.918 --> 20:52.878
Meg should
probably get a lawyer.

20:52.961 --> 20:56.757
Oh, sweetie, thank you for keeping
our spirits up with your stories.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.383
Your daughter's
a sexual predator.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.345
If you don't do anything,
she could go to jail for a long time.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.263
Don't thank me, Lois.
Thank my ancestors

21:03.347 --> 21:05.516
for living
lives of greatness.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.267
All right, guys,
just take her away.

21:07.351 --> 21:08.477
Dad, help!

21:08.560 --> 21:09.603
(Meg screaming)

21:09.686 --> 21:12.397
Dad!
Have fun at the dance, Meg.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.900
I hope she does.
That kid really deserves it.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.531
(theme music playing)
