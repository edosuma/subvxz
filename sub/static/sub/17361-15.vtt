WEBVTT

00:03.712 --> 00:06.579
(walker growling)

00:14.723 --> 00:17.430
Tara:
They-- they have guns.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.057
A lot of them.
I saw it.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.640
- Daryl: What?
- Tara: That group.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.897
Um, the women I met.

00:26.067 --> 00:29.559
(Tara sighs)
They have an armory. They have guns.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.400
Rick: Why didn't you tell us
before now?

00:32.574 --> 00:34.530
I made a promise, Rick.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.114
(walkers growling)

00:40.373 --> 00:42.785
Do you ever think
about who you've killed?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.997
Yeah.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.008
(growling continues)

00:57.682 --> 01:00.059
Rick:
Are you ready if this goes south?

01:00.226 --> 01:01.762
Tara:
It won't.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.268
Rick: If it does,
you don't need to feel bad.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.804
Tara:
I do feel bad.

01:05.982 --> 01:06.971
|wi||.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.227
Rick: Tara...

01:08.401 --> 01:11.143
you don't have to.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.858
(growling continues)

01:23.333 --> 01:26.200
(music playing)

02:03.373 --> 02:04.738
(birds chirping, sheep bleating)

02:04.916 --> 02:06.747
Maggie: You need
to cover this with a tarp.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.284
- Eduardo: A tarp?
- Maggie: Tarp.

02:09.462 --> 02:10.497
Eduardo:
Why?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.537
Think about it.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.216
Okay. Just tell me.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.500
(sighs)

02:16.678 --> 02:18.134
They want warmth

02:18.304 --> 02:19.885
so they'll put out shoots
before the last freeze.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.763
That way, we pull back the tarp,
they die naturally,

02:22.934 --> 02:25.016
saves on all
the endless weeding.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.972
Get to tarping.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.603
You got it, boss lady.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.731
Uh, wait. (chuckles)
Where are you going?

02:31.901 --> 02:33.641
l, uh--
I'm not a farmer.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.185
I need some help here.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.864
No, you don't.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.817
I saw a wild blueberry bush
growing outside.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.277
If it's young enough,

02:40.451 --> 02:41.736
I'm gonna pull it up
and replant it here.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.448
Good one will produce
for over 40 years.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.999
We got to start acting
like we'll be around that long.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.577
(hammering)

02:48.751 --> 02:51.083
Cool. Yeah.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.415
Just tarp.
Don't touch.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.501
I'll see
how you do after.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.259
(grunts)

03:07.437 --> 03:10.270
Once you're up,
watch for the signal.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.646
(breathing heavily)

03:11.816 --> 03:13.647
What time
does the clock start?

03:13.818 --> 03:15.774
Soon as she's in.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.280
You good?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.863
I'm good enough.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.510
I'm glad you came.
I know it's been hard.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.515
- I know you don't want this.
- Didn't want this,

03:48.686 --> 03:50.392
but I'm starting to understand
what's on the menu now.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.803
We can hide
like these people,

03:51.981 --> 03:53.687
we can keep trying
to serve The Saviors,

03:53.858 --> 03:55.644
and I can watch you get
randomly beaten every so often,

03:55.818 --> 03:56.807
or else we can fight.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.518
So, here we are.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.687
(sighs)

04:00.865 --> 04:04.153
And being with you, well...

04:04.327 --> 04:06.659
it makes abject terror
tolerable.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.164
lshould've tried harder
to stop Rosita and Sasha.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.545
If they'd have just waited
one more day...

04:17.715 --> 04:19.421
Well,
Sasha's a good shot,

04:19.592 --> 04:23.176
and Rosita knows
how to take care of herself.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.634
Probably back at Hilltop
right now.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.515
Least I hope so.
We're gonna need 'em.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.517
There's a whole lot of people
still got to die.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.691
(lock disengages)

04:38.861 --> 04:41.022
(door creaks open)

04:47.662 --> 04:49.527
Hey, there.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.197
You okay?

04:52.375 --> 04:55.538
Can I get some water?

05:06.597 --> 05:09.179
I should introduce myself.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.887
l'm David.

05:12.061 --> 05:16.680
I wonder if you remember me
from last night.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.019
Do you?

05:19.193 --> 05:21.479
No.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.947
Well,
I can forgive that.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.403
Last night
was kind of a shitstorm.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.241
l was the guy that gave the rope
to the guys that tied you up.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.953
| always keep some close.

05:36.127 --> 05:39.039
There's just all kinds
of fun and interesting things

05:39.213 --> 05:43.627
you can do with rope.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.713
God, you're pretty.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.100
lfl give you some water,

05:55.271 --> 05:59.731
which is not something
I'm supposed to do,

05:59.901 --> 06:02.768
will you do something
for me?

06:02.945 --> 06:06.278
Something
you're not supposed to do?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.235
Will you?

06:11.829 --> 06:15.367
(breathing shakily)

06:20.630 --> 06:23.622
Tell me
how thirsty you are.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.962
Go to hell.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.176
(grunts)

06:33.351 --> 06:35.637
(chuckles)

06:35.812 --> 06:38.929
Oh, shit.
(chuckles)

06:42.610 --> 06:45.522
Fighting's just gonna
make it last longer.

06:48.032 --> 06:52.366
Which, for the record,
is fine by me.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.619
- (clangs)
- David!

06:56.165 --> 06:58.030
What the hell
are you doing in here?

06:58.209 --> 06:59.619
Negan, sir--

06:59.794 --> 07:02.160
Do you really think
I need you to answer that?

07:02.338 --> 07:04.829
I can see that you're trying
to rape this woman.

07:05.007 --> 07:09.467
You were trying to rape
this woman, weren't you?

07:17.228 --> 07:20.140
This is some
unacceptable behavior.

07:20.314 --> 07:23.056
Rape is against
the rules here.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.067
lwouldn't wanna be somewhere
where it wasn't.

07:26.237 --> 07:31.527
Someone in charge who let
something like that fly...

07:31.701 --> 07:34.488
Whew.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.119
(breathing quickly)

07:40.585 --> 07:43.042
David.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.295
You really
crossed a line here.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.586
I'm sorry, sir.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.795
(breathing shakily)

07:56.225 --> 07:58.557
You know what?

07:58.728 --> 08:00.684
I do not accept
your apology.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.844
(grunts lightly)

08:02.023 --> 08:03.513
ï¬‚huds)

08:05.443 --> 08:07.809
(Negan sighs)

08:09.405 --> 08:12.397
(whistles)
Hey!

08:12.575 --> 08:15.612
Get, uh...

08:15.786 --> 08:18.744
Sasha.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.078
That is a beautiful name.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.922
Get Sasha here
a new T-shirt.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.260
I'm sorry
you had to see that.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.547
Sorry 'bout the rope, too.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.431
Probably overkill,

08:39.602 --> 08:44.221
but you did cause
one hell of a fracas last night.

08:50.279 --> 08:53.021
(chucang)
Oh, shit.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.990
I remember you.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.493
Yeah.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.113
You were there.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.373
(clicks tongue twice)

09:04.544 --> 09:08.787
0h, hell.
I get it now.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.876
I got to hand it to you.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.167
You've got some beach-ball-sized
lady nuts on you,

09:14.345 --> 09:16.802
coming in all kamikaze
like that.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.338
Big question here,

09:18.516 --> 09:20.256
and I need the truth
on this one...

09:23.521 --> 09:26.809
did Rick
put you up to this?

09:26.983 --> 09:29.315
Rick?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.811
Your bitch?

09:32.989 --> 09:33.978
No.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.657
(chuckles)

09:35.825 --> 09:38.737
Either way, you must've thought
it was gonna be the end,

09:38.911 --> 09:41.823
coming in on your lonesome
like that.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.580
But that's not the way
it's got to go.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.206
Unh-unh.
Just the opposite.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.242
See, this...

09:48.421 --> 09:51.913
well, this could be
the beginning.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.837
(Lucille taps lightly)

10:00.016 --> 10:01.847
(sighs)

10:02.018 --> 10:06.182
This knife is yours now.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.347
You can try to use it,
take me out,

10:09.525 --> 10:12.517
but considering
lam standing above you,

10:12.695 --> 10:14.401
holding a baseball bat,

10:14.572 --> 10:17.609
that doesn't seem
real smart.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.399
Now, you can use it
to slit your wrists,

10:20.578 --> 10:23.194
which would be a damn shame,
but I get it.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.205
You're obviously not
on the shiny side of the street,

10:26.375 --> 10:28.206
given recent events.

10:28.377 --> 10:31.289
Now, you can sit there
and do nothin',

10:31.464 --> 10:35.628
wait for ol' David to come back
to life and eat your face,

10:35.801 --> 10:38.053
also a damn shame
and kinda nuts,

10:38.220 --> 10:40.597
but, hell,
to each their own.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.053
Or...

10:44.226 --> 10:48.139
you can use that blade
and stop ol' Rapey Davey

10:48.314 --> 10:52.102
from becoming
Dead-Alive Rapey Davey,

10:52.276 --> 10:57.111
save yourself, join the cause.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.157
I know what I'd do.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.661
What?

11:05.831 --> 11:08.288
I'm a man short.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.916
Hell, you can't really call
this piece of shit a man,

11:11.087 --> 11:12.452
but still, l'm short,

11:12.630 --> 11:15.167
and you got those
beach-ball-sized lady nuts,

11:15.341 --> 11:19.129
and I wanna harness
the heat comin' off of 'em.

11:19.303 --> 11:23.592
You can help me
run this place one day,

11:23.766 --> 11:27.759
all of us together,
following the rules,

11:27.937 --> 11:29.598
workin' on the same side
of things.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.013
That's all
this was ever about.

11:32.191 --> 11:36.525
And it still can be
for you.

11:36.696 --> 11:41.611
I know it's hard to picture,
considering what I did.

11:41.784 --> 11:46.778
But, Sasha,
we all got shit to get over.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.714
Take some time.
Think about it.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.623
Whatever you decide,
so it shall be.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.258
No pressure.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.966
And, again,
I am sorry you had to see that,

12:04.140 --> 12:09.180
even though I know
you have seen some things.

12:09.353 --> 12:12.516
ljust want you
to understand...

12:12.690 --> 12:15.227
we are not monsters.

12:30.875 --> 12:35.244
(door closes, lock engages)

12:38.674 --> 12:42.041
(lock disengages)

12:42.219 --> 12:45.177
(door creaks open)

12:49.852 --> 12:52.594
(door creaks)

12:52.772 --> 12:54.728
(lock engages)

12:57.234 --> 12:59.816
What did they do
to you?

13:03.032 --> 13:05.694
They're keepin' me safe.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.612
I brought you
some creature comforts.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.285
Full disclosure, the pillow
is not hypoallergenic.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.078
(sniffs)

13:19.256 --> 13:20.632
There was some debate

13:20.800 --> 13:22.711
as to whether or not
I should come in here.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.216
They said in the event
of a hostage situation

13:24.386 --> 13:25.592
with the pig sticker

13:25.763 --> 13:27.754
that I would fully be
on my own.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.844
Just wanted to share that.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.314
Negan relayed to me
his offer to you.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.770
It's my opinion that
you should accept said offer,

13:40.945 --> 13:42.560
just as I did.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.603
I know it's a hold-your-nose
situation,

13:44.782 --> 13:46.443
but taking up
with the management here

13:46.617 --> 13:49.108
was indeed
the correct select.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.833
You know, I believed
I could be brave,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.037
that I could be a survivor
like Abraham was,

13:58.212 --> 14:01.420
and ridin' that RV
into the sunset was...

14:01.590 --> 14:05.424
some of the greatest 37 minutes
of my existence.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.882
But I know now that
l was full-tilt delusional.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.512
l have never in my life
been as scared

14:14.687 --> 14:17.178
as l was
that night in the woods,

14:17.356 --> 14:19.438
kit to the grit,

14:19.608 --> 14:21.599
fully believing my number's
about to be called,

14:21.777 --> 14:24.189
then seeing it happen
to someone brave...

14:25.865 --> 14:29.107
to a survivor.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.274
And then
the pants-pissing terror

14:30.452 --> 14:32.989
of the rinse and repeat
of that very same event--

14:33.163 --> 14:34.744
ljust--

14:36.792 --> 14:38.498
I couldn't.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.539
Being here means
I'll never have to again.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.461
And neither will you
if you just say "yes."

14:49.638 --> 14:52.755
Please say "yes."

14:55.311 --> 14:57.176
He would want you to.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.442
He wouldn't.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.946
I do.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.823
We're still here.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.655
Things have changed.
We can change with 'em.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.740
We have to.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.917
Go.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.351
He's, uh, starting to...

15:36.518 --> 15:38.429
Please.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.725
Go.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.102
(knock on door)

15:48.280 --> 15:51.522
(lock disengages,
door creaks open)

15:59.875 --> 16:03.117
(door closes, lock engages)

16:11.553 --> 16:15.796
(growling)

16:21.313 --> 16:24.146
(birds chirping)

16:24.316 --> 16:26.557
(insects buzzing)

16:32.199 --> 16:35.566
Don't think I've seen you
outside the walls.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.907
Well, I built these walls
to use them.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.619
If I want greenery,
| eat a salad.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.203
Then why are you here?

16:44.378 --> 16:46.414
l was hoping
we could talk.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.249
Then I saw you
come out here alone.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.289
l was concerned.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.549
Where are your friends?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.513
They went out.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.220
They're looking
for something they need.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.225
Without you?

17:02.396 --> 17:07.732
NOW, I'm just wondering--
Why you still here, Maggie?

17:07.901 --> 17:09.186
Hmm?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.567
With Carson gone...

17:10.738 --> 17:13.980
I heard you were
gonna get him back.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.989
That not true?

17:17.411 --> 17:19.117
Was it just something
you said?

17:19.288 --> 17:21.199
Maggie, you've got to start
trusting me.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.489
You know, people are tense,
they're worried.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.079
Everybody'd be
a hell of a lot better

17:26.253 --> 17:30.246
if-- if we could present
a-a united front.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.382
It would be a lot easier if we
actually were a united front.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.543
You're right.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.339
I need to be more open
to working together.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.507
I apologize.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.471
I never intended
for things between us

17:43.645 --> 17:46.102
to come to this point.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.184
I appreciate that.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.858
It's never too late
to change.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.109
You know that?

17:58.660 --> 18:01.527
If you're serious, I'll come by
later and we can talk more.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.162
Fine. Great.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.662
(twig snaps)

18:11.090 --> 18:13.877
I thought this'd
just take a second.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.838
Would you mind keeping
an eye out while I finish up?

18:17.012 --> 18:18.218
Could you do that?

18:18.388 --> 18:19.798
Happyto.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.544
(sighs)

19:02.808 --> 19:04.469
(twig snaps)

19:05.978 --> 19:07.093
Oh!

19:07.271 --> 19:08.852
We got one.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.558
I'll do it.

19:10.732 --> 19:14.566
Uh, uh-- I'm here
to protect the pregnant lady.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.397
Don't need the pregnant lady
to protect me.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.733
Have you ever
killed one before?

19:19.908 --> 19:21.990
I wouldn't be here
ifl hadn't.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.663
It's fine.
I got it.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.244
No.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.626
(walker growling)

19:40.512 --> 19:42.924
Oh, Jesus.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.431
Fine. Do it.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.805
- (growling)
- (exclaims)

20:00.908 --> 20:03.024
Maggie!

20:06.205 --> 20:08.070
Please help me!

20:08.248 --> 20:09.909
(growling continues)

20:10.083 --> 20:11.994
- (growling stops)
- (groans)

20:12.169 --> 20:14.581
(breathing heavily)

20:18.634 --> 20:20.590
You okay?

20:20.761 --> 20:22.171
(breathing heavily)

20:22.346 --> 20:24.007
(retches)

20:24.181 --> 20:28.094
(coughs)

20:30.562 --> 20:33.304
He hasn't
killed one before.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.847
He's learning.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.016
That's not
what he told us.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.780
Thanks for the help.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.501
(sighs)

20:58.715 --> 21:02.082
Ooh. You catch that
yourself?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.876
- Shit, yeah.
- Rachel.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.045
I mean, yeah.
(chuckles)

21:06.223 --> 21:07.338
Gonna go clean it.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.596
Okay.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.632
(chuckles)

21:12.896 --> 21:14.932
(door creaks)

21:18.443 --> 21:20.024
Tara: Hi.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.156
Stay quiet

21:30.330 --> 21:32.241
and put your hands
on your head.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.828
We should've just killed you
in the village.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.290
You're gonna be glad
you didn't.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.840
You're not alone,
are you?

21:41.008 --> 21:41.997
Sit.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.123
What do you want?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.838
I want you to sit.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.426
(door opens)

21:50.600 --> 21:52.465
(door closes)

21:53.937 --> 21:55.928
Tara:
Hey, Cyndie.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.065
You promised.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.192
Yeah. I did.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.570
Putyourhands
on your head.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.364
I didn't have a choice.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.249
Why are you here?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.661
Tara: I said
I didn't have a choice.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.795
But you do,
both of you do.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.126
My friends
are out there right now,

22:24.301 --> 22:25.290
and they're
gonna take this place,

22:25.469 --> 22:26.834
hopefully
without firing a shot.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.094
What? You're-- you're gonna
"take this place"?

22:29.264 --> 22:30.253
What are you
talking about?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.886
- We need your guns.
- What?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.425
We're gonna fight
the Saviors.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.013
- You should join us.
- No.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.678
The Saviors killed
your fathers,

22:37.856 --> 22:40.347
your brothers, husbands, sons,
and you ran from them.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.981
I thought
we got rid of them.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.359
Beatrice said there was more
out there, and she was right.

22:44.529 --> 22:48.647
They came back.
They killed my friends.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.611
They killed
my girlfriend.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.027
They took us over.
They took everything from us.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.413
We do whatever
the Saviors tell us to do,

22:56.583 --> 22:58.198
and they think we're still
doing that, but we're not.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.617
We're gonna fight them.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.660
And we have
other communities beside us,

23:01.838 --> 23:03.624
and with Oceanside,
we would have an army.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.539
So, that's it?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.753
"Thanks for the guns.
You should join us"?

23:07.928 --> 23:10.135
If we fight them together,
we can beat them.

23:10.305 --> 23:11.590
We have to try.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.006
They'll win, Tara.
I've seen it. So have you.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.391
Just talk to the leader
of my group, Rick.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.142
Just talk, and we don't
have to take over this place.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.302
We don't want to.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.888
I can give them
the signal to stop this,

23:21.066 --> 23:23.148
but you have to tell me
right now.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.694
Listen. We're not
just hiding in the woods.

23:27.864 --> 23:30.446
We're doing something.
We're not giving up.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.074
I didn't want to break
my promise, Cyndie, okay?

23:33.245 --> 23:36.533
But the world can belong
to good people, to fair people,

23:36.706 --> 23:38.742
if we're
all just brave enough to try.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.952
We are not good,

23:40.127 --> 23:41.537
and we are not brave.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.871
Neither you nor me.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.206
She is.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.791
That's why
we're in this mess.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.081
(sighs)

23:47.259 --> 23:48.339
Look, Tara,
if you take our guns,

23:48.510 --> 23:49.716
you might as well
be killing us all.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.387
That's what
you'll be doing.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.045
We should talk to them.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.429
No.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.055
We can try to stop this.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.636
No, Cyndie.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.312
It doesn't matter.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.936
You can't.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.193
(screaming)

24:10.866 --> 24:13.107
Kathy: Go! Go!

24:13.285 --> 24:16.402
(indistinct shouting)

24:16.580 --> 24:18.286
The arsenal!

24:33.388 --> 24:35.549
Daryl:
On the ground. Now.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.716
Those hands--
put them on your head.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.686
Please.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.290
Your people
killing my people?

25:04.461 --> 25:06.167
The bombs
were outside the walls.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.374
You could've stopped this.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.754
Look,
I hope everyone is okay.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.916
- I do.
- They better be.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.594
Stand up.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.252
It's time to move.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.424
(inhales sharply)

25:20.602 --> 25:21.637
It's my legs.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.347
Stop, stop.
Back up. Back up.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.978
Cyndie, stop!

25:31.446 --> 25:32.811
- It's empty.
- What?

25:32.989 --> 25:34.820
It's unloaded.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.698
We didn't come here
to hurt anybody.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.485
Cyndie, give it here.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.700
Now.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.616
Natania,
just talk to Rick.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.250
Shut up.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.253
(panting)

25:50.423 --> 25:51.833
Everybody down!

25:52.008 --> 25:54.124
- Hands on your heads.
- Everybody stay calm.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.133
Carl: We don't want anyone
to get hurt.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.885
Stay down and listen
to what we say.

25:58.056 --> 26:01.548
We want this to go as simply
and as peacefully as possible.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.512
All of you
can make it that way.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.928
Get down over there.
Keep quiet.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.811
Now, we made
a lot of noise.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.602
We want to wrap this up quick
so you can send people

26:13.780 --> 26:15.896
to redirect
anything coming this way.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.360
Tara said your forests
are relatively clear,

26:18.535 --> 26:20.071
so we won't take
any chances.

26:20.245 --> 26:24.579
No one needs to get hurt.

26:24.749 --> 26:28.037
This is just about
what you have, what we need.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.917
Natania:
Nobody's taking anything.

26:30.088 --> 26:34.878
You need to let everyone go
and leave right now.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.042
Just walk away
or this one dies.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.087
Yeah,
we'll leave you alone.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.971
But we're taking your weapons
with us.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.222
That's not gonna change.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.510
It's Natania, right?

26:46.688 --> 26:51.352
Put the gun down, and let's talk
about what we can change.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.482
No.
Leave right now.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.695
Michonne, don't!

26:59.784 --> 27:01.320
We just
wanna be left alone.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.280
Yeah,
we'll leave you alone.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.946
Just let go of her.
Now.

27:06.124 --> 27:09.366
Or we'll kill you.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.000
None of us want that.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.162
They want us
to fight The Saviors.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.258
We tried that.
We lost. Too much.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.009
We're not gonna lose
anymore--

27:20.180 --> 27:22.842
not our guns,
not our safety,

27:23.016 --> 27:24.301
not after everything
we've done to get here.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.717
We're gonna win--

27:26.895 --> 27:29.887
with your guns,
with or without your help.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.937
Natania,
put the gun down.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.070
You kill me, and you die.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.074
And my people take the guns
and nothing changes.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.413
Maybe we should try.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.041
(hushed chatter)

27:52.212 --> 27:53.793
Grandma, stop.

27:53.963 --> 27:56.454
It's over.
Just talk to them, okay?

27:56.633 --> 27:59.170
It's not over!

27:59.344 --> 28:01.380
They've forgotten.

28:01.554 --> 28:02.964
You've all forgotten.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.926
Some of you actually want
to fight them?

28:06.101 --> 28:07.511
After everything?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.143
We can lose our guns,

28:10.313 --> 28:12.804
but us leaving this place
to fight?

28:12.982 --> 28:14.313
After everything?

28:14.484 --> 28:16.315
l have to remind you!

28:16.486 --> 28:17.475
Yes.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.020
lam gonna do this,
and then I'm gonna die.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.359
But it's that important.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.819
This is your life,
all of you.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.699
Remember
what it looks like.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.952
Remember
what they did to us!

28:28.123 --> 28:29.158
You need to see this.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.913
Open your eyes!

28:31.084 --> 28:32.369
Michonne:
Rick! Walkers!

28:32.544 --> 28:33.579
(grunts)

28:33.753 --> 28:35.618
ï¬‚huds)

28:38.591 --> 28:39.751
Rick: Everybody up!

28:39.926 --> 28:41.666
Get the children
behind us!

28:41.845 --> 28:42.960
They're coming.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.253
First shift,
join them on the line.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.592
Knives out.
Dead only. Dead only!

28:46.766 --> 28:48.347
Don't go anywhere.

28:48.518 --> 28:51.976
Everyone, shots
within 10 feet of the line.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.353
That's it.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.605
(walkers growling)

29:04.367 --> 29:05.573
Now!

29:05.744 --> 29:07.780
(gunfire)

29:37.317 --> 29:39.399
(grunts)

29:42.030 --> 29:43.816
(grunts)

29:45.325 --> 29:46.906
(gunfire)

29:55.293 --> 29:57.204
(gunfire stops)

30:12.727 --> 30:17.266
No. We're not
fighting them with you.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.773
So take your damn guns
and go.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.901
(lock disengages)

30:31.079 --> 30:33.491
(door creaks open)

30:48.388 --> 30:50.800
You win.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.805
No.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.809
You win.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.269
Get some people in here.
Clean this up.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.445
What?

31:15.623 --> 31:16.829
You didn't actually think

31:17.000 --> 31:19.912
l was gonna let you keep this,
did you?

31:21.754 --> 31:23.494
You still got a ways to go

31:23.673 --> 31:27.336
before I'll believe
you're fully on board here.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.842
Baby steps.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.050
It is absolutely
not personal.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.930
If the situation
was reversed,

31:35.101 --> 31:38.184
I'm sure you wouldn't
believe me, either.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.515
Still...

31:40.690 --> 31:43.898
the way
you saved yourself,

31:44.068 --> 31:47.481
the way you surrendered
to me just now--

31:47.655 --> 31:49.361
that is a damn good start.

31:49.532 --> 31:54.526
But we got to work
on some things, Sasha.

31:54.704 --> 32:00.199
But I promise you,
I will try to make it fun.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.493
Cards on the table...

32:03.671 --> 32:05.252
a little birdie told me

32:05.423 --> 32:09.541
that Rick and the rest of your
people are up to no good.

32:09.719 --> 32:12.506
And, well,
that needs to change,

32:12.680 --> 32:15.296
and you're
gonna help me change it.

32:15.475 --> 32:18.308
We're gonna find us
a win-win.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.513
How?

32:19.687 --> 32:20.767
What are you--

32:20.939 --> 32:22.224
Hey, I'm gonna get
you some stuff

32:22.398 --> 32:23.808
to make you
more comfortable,

32:23.983 --> 32:26.690
let you have a taste
of what it is we have to offer.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.271
Spend the night
enjoying it,

32:28.446 --> 32:30.778
'cause tomorrow...

32:30.949 --> 32:35.033
is gonna be a big day.
(stomps)

32:36.162 --> 32:38.403
(chuckles)

33:07.110 --> 33:09.021
(sighs)

33:42.228 --> 33:43.764
Kal!

33:52.363 --> 33:53.773
Yeah?

33:53.948 --> 33:56.781
I'm gonna need you
to drive me somewhere.

33:56.951 --> 33:59.033
You're gonna want
to pack a bag.

34:01.330 --> 34:03.946
(knocks on door)

34:04.125 --> 34:06.081
Hello?

34:06.252 --> 34:08.163
It's Eugene.

34:08.337 --> 34:12.080
Word in the halls is that
you're all-in with things here.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.873
It may not seem
like it now,

34:14.052 --> 34:15.212
but I assure you,

34:15.386 --> 34:17.763
you, too,
made the correct select.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.883
Sasha: l was wrong.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.436
I can't.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.317
I won't.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.569
I've been sitting here,

34:34.739 --> 34:38.152
trying to figure out
howl could,

34:38.326 --> 34:41.159
with what happened,

34:41.329 --> 34:42.819
with our friends
still out there,

34:42.997 --> 34:45.409
still being hurt
by them.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.950
I don't know
how I could've said that.

34:49.128 --> 34:54.088
And now I am trapped.

34:54.258 --> 34:55.668
You have to help me.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.049
lwill.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.710
I'll help you
get used to the idea

34:58.888 --> 35:02.096
and illustrate the equation
and demonstrate why--

35:02.266 --> 35:04.097
It was a mistake.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.678
l was ready.

35:05.853 --> 35:09.220
I knew, if I didn't
kill him last night,

35:09.398 --> 35:11.013
it'd be over.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.808
And I didn't, so it is.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.602
It has to be.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.030
You have to get me
something--

35:20.201 --> 35:23.864
a knife, a gun,
a razor blade.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.653
For Negan?

35:25.832 --> 35:26.992
No!

35:28.709 --> 35:32.748
One way or another, he is gonna
use me to hurt my friends--

35:32.922 --> 35:36.665
our friends.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.799
(Sasha's voice breaking)
And there is nothing I can do about it

35:38.970 --> 35:42.178
except make sure I'm not alive
to give him the chance.

35:42.348 --> 35:46.136
If he has me,
he will hurt them.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.426
l have to die.

35:48.604 --> 35:49.684
It's the only way.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.187
l-l don't--
I-I don't think that--

35:51.357 --> 35:53.143
I know you won't do anything
to stop them.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.397
I know that.

35:54.569 --> 35:58.482
But, please, Eugene...

35:58.656 --> 36:02.069
don't let them use me
to hurt our people.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.483
(Sasha crying)
Please, you have to give me

36:03.661 --> 36:09.247
something to stop this--
a gun, a knife, glass.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.657
I don't care.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.917
l have to die.

36:13.087 --> 36:14.702
Please.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.464
I will consider it.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.056
Thank you.

36:36.485 --> 36:38.646
(bells ringing)

36:51.709 --> 36:54.075
(ringing continues)

37:01.427 --> 37:03.588
We don't need all this,
do we?

37:04.764 --> 37:05.879
(sighs)

37:06.057 --> 37:08.890
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.769
It's notjust
the ones I killed.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.275
I think about the people
I didn't kill, too.

37:19.445 --> 37:21.811
(ringing continues)

37:21.989 --> 37:23.149
(ringing stops)

37:29.497 --> 37:34.082
We're gonna bring them back
when it's all over.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.413
l-l want to go with you.

37:36.587 --> 37:37.827
Some of us do,
but not all of us,

37:38.005 --> 37:39.791
and it has to be all of us.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.922
My grandmother thinks
you'll all be dead.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.550
Yeah, well, your grandmother's
wrong about a lot of things.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.926
Where is she?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.257
She didn't want
to see this.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.467
She's lying down.
I hit her pretty hard.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.974
Thanks for saving
my life before.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.805
And the other time.

37:53.980 --> 37:54.969
Oh, and then
the other time.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.271
(chuckles)
Maybe today.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.602
Thanks.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.143
Hey.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.982
Thank you.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.817
For what you're doing.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.575
You're
not leaving us any?

38:13.749 --> 38:15.580
Nope.
See ya later, Rachel.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.454
You okay?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.464
Yeah.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.466
You're right.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.049
I don't have to feel bad.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.106
(sighs)

38:48.492 --> 38:50.357
(knock on door)

38:50.536 --> 38:51.571
Eugene:Sasha?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.111
I'm here.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.828
(sighs)

38:58.002 --> 39:01.210
I've given our last exchange
a good, hard pro/con think.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.296
I've decided
to grant your request.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.304
(Sasha sighs)

39:11.474 --> 39:14.216
This will do it.

39:20.024 --> 39:24.484
It's a poison,
homemade by yours truly.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.154
It will bring
about certain death

39:26.322 --> 39:27.732
in approximately
20 to 30 minutes

39:27.907 --> 39:30.319
upon the moment
of ingestion.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.734
I would like to believe
that it's painless.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.448
I am not--
I'm not certain.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.954
I made it at the behest
of others for similar reasons,

39:37.124 --> 39:38.204
only it came to pass that

39:38.376 --> 39:39.411
they were feeding me
the bum's steer,

39:39.585 --> 39:40.995
so I cut bait.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.167
The difference here
is that

39:45.341 --> 39:47.252
you and l have been
long-time traveling companions,

39:47.426 --> 39:49.633
and you have proven yourself
to be honest, brave,

39:49.804 --> 39:51.590
and fully self-aware.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.471
I'm certain I owe you
for things.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.382
You asked me
for a way out.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.471
I had access to one.

40:01.023 --> 40:04.140
For the record, I absolutely
do not want you to go.

40:06.278 --> 40:09.816
But it sounds to me like you
happen to be already gone.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.546
(gate clangs, creaking)

40:34.723 --> 40:37.214
(engine revving)

40:49.029 --> 40:50.690
(insects chirping)

40:50.865 --> 40:53.106
(vehicle door closes)

40:55.077 --> 40:56.613
Hey, are you okay?

40:56.787 --> 40:58.573
Where's Sasha?

41:02.918 --> 41:05.000
There's someone here.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.543
(door creaks)

41:25.483 --> 41:26.893
(exclaims)

41:27.067 --> 41:28.978
Whoa. Whoa.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:31.697 --> 41:33.608
Slow down. Come on.
Whoa!

41:33.782 --> 41:35.773
He says
he wants to help us.

41:35.951 --> 41:38.442
(breathing heavily)

41:42.500 --> 41:46.413
That true?

41:46.587 --> 41:48.703
You want to help?

41:48.881 --> 41:50.462
I do.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.603
Okay.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.859
(gun cocks)

42:13.531 --> 42:15.772
Get on your knees.

42:21.247 --> 42:25.331
