01:28.546 --> 01:31.338
Marlon Butterpaws,

01:31.340 --> 01:35.137
we have contacted our
informant on Planet Skibbles.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.972
No trace of the Master Bone.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.433
Drat, my trusty Tinkaroo.

01:41.225 --> 01:44.017
Another planet and still no
Master Bone.

01:44.019 --> 01:46.395
We must find that bone at once.

01:46.397 --> 01:50.902
What's so special about a
bone anyway, Marlon Butterpaws?

01:52.153 --> 01:54.695
The Master Bone is a
bone of legend.

01:54.697 --> 01:57.657
A bone of an ancient and rare
dinosaur.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.991
A bone so incredible

01:58.993 --> 02:01.493
it can bestow upon those who
obtain it

02:01.495 --> 02:04.873
the ability to rule the entire
universe.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.666
But the top secret agents of
Star Paws

02:07.668 --> 02:10.586
are also looking for the bone.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.922
What if they find
it before we do?

02:12.924 --> 02:16.091
Never, I will take care
of those pesky agents.

02:16.093 --> 02:17.802
They will not stop me.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.596
We will find the bone first.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.556
Once you possess the bone,

02:22.558 --> 02:26.268
you'll be the most powerful
kitty in the cosmos,

02:26.270 --> 02:28.353
Marlon Butterpaws.

02:28.355 --> 02:30.106
As it should be.

02:30.108 --> 02:35.153
I will ride from universe to
universe, galaxy to galaxy,

02:35.155 --> 02:38.739
dimension to dimension,
completely unstoppable,

02:38.741 --> 02:43.287
wreaking kitty havoc
everywhere we go!

02:44.830 --> 02:49.835
That's downright evil,
Marlon Butterpaws.

02:51.837 --> 02:57.007
I will plunder every planet
and take all their treats.

02:57.009 --> 03:00.053
Sardines, kibble, tuna!

03:00.055 --> 03:04.643
Everything fishy will be mine!

03:06.853 --> 03:09.853
A million
megalons into the future,

03:09.855 --> 03:14.860
in a galaxy inside a nebula
to the right of a black hole,

03:15.111 --> 03:18.196
a secret elite group stands
alone

03:18.198 --> 03:20.989
to protect the universe from
evil.

03:20.991 --> 03:28.498
This elite group is known
simply as Star Paws.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.458
Cadet Tony Skyfetcher.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.544
Cadet Billy June Spaceslobber.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.506
Ready for pooper-scooper
assignment, Officer Rufflebuns.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.843
Dog speed.

03:39.885 --> 03:42.804
Greeting, Captain Fuzzface.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.266
Always a displeasure to see your
ugly mug.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.769
Marlon Butterpaws.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.229
In the furball, Captain
Fuzzface.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.607
It's me, your arch-nemesis.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.234
I've heard you are
training your best agents

03:57.236 --> 04:00.113
to get to the Master Bone.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.365
You better believe
it, Marlon Butterpaws.

04:03.367 --> 04:07.745
Well, too bad about
that, ugly mug.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.373
I've got a secret.

04:10.375 --> 04:14.001
What have you done
now, Marlon Butterpaws?

04:14.003 --> 04:16.796
I've dognapped all
your best agents.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.632
Now you have nobody to
go after the Master Bone.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.596
And I will get to it first!

04:23.846 --> 04:25.637
You must release them at once.

04:25.639 --> 04:29.558
Why, so they can find
the Master Bone before me?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.269
No way.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.440
The Master Bone will be
mine, and mine alone.

04:35.442 --> 04:40.197
And with it I will rule
the universe!

04:41.238 --> 04:43.322
See you later, bad breath.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.699
I need two agents, now.

04:45.701 --> 04:47.995
Or the universe is kitty toast.

05:05.387 --> 05:08.223
Whoa, Billy June, I never
knew space-poop scooping

05:08.225 --> 05:09.640
could be so much fun.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.974
I think that's cuz

05:10.976 --> 05:13.562
there ain't much much poop in
space, Tony.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.313
That's certainly a plus,
Billy June.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.983
I think you mean
a minus, Tony.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.820
You know, cuz there's no poop,
that's a negative number.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.947
Either way Billy June,

05:23.949 --> 05:26.031
I think just being in space is
amazing.

05:26.033 --> 05:28.409
Yep, I reckon it is.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.370
Whoa, look at that nebula!

05:30.372 --> 05:33.331
That's pretty nice.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.920
Cadets Skyfetcher,
Spaceslobber.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.337
Hey, Agent Big Boy.

05:40.339 --> 05:43.425
What's the 329, Agent Big Boy?

05:43.427 --> 05:47.344
You mean what's the 411,
Spaceslobber.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.557
No, I mean 329,

05:50.559 --> 05:54.310
given we're 25 degrees
east of space and time,

05:54.312 --> 05:57.856
in the third quadrant of
Fluffbutt Nebula.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.356
Which means we're 2,000
light-years

05:59.358 --> 06:00.983
from the Star Paws space
station.

06:00.985 --> 06:04.406
And out here, 411 is 329.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.240
Yeah.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.242
No, it's still 411.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.368
Now if I make...

06:10.370 --> 06:13.329
What's the 329, Agent Big Boy?

06:13.331 --> 06:16.585
Report to Captain Fuzzface
immediately.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.334
Whoa, did you hear that Billy
June?

06:19.336 --> 06:24.132
Captain Fuzzface wants to see
us.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.052
Slobbery space bones!

06:27.345 --> 06:28.385
You think it's about our Secret
Service training test, Tony?

06:28.387 --> 06:29.219
What else could it be?

06:29.221 --> 06:30.805
Skyfetcher, Spaceslobber.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.848
Yes sir.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.558
Sir, yes sir.

06:33.560 --> 06:38.312
I have the results of your
Star Paws agent training tests.

06:38.314 --> 06:41.315
Oh boy, oh boy, this
is gonna be awesome.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.402
How did we do, Captain
Fuzzface?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.779
Skyfetcher, Spaceslobber.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.656
You have failed all your tests.

06:49.658 --> 06:51.367
Whoa.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.911
Whoa.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.579
Both of you failed your IQ
test.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.082
Yeah, that was a tough one,
Captain.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.375
You failed your flea-and-tick
test.

07:00.377 --> 07:02.961
Yeah, been itching up a storm
lately.

07:02.963 --> 07:06.591
Those flea collars,
they don't work too good.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.675
You failed your fetch test.

07:08.677 --> 07:11.178
We didn't realize they
wanted us to fetch the paper.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.557
So we went for the trainer's
butt.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.601
A lot more to grab onto,
anyway.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.646
You failed your rollover test.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.606
Yeah, we rolled under instead.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.651
You definitely failed
your play dead test.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.985
Shucks.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.654
In fact, you two turned out to
be

07:28.656 --> 07:32.199
the worst canine recruits we've
ever had.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.618
Whoa.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.704
Incredible.

07:35.579 --> 07:37.790
We did achieve something.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.166
Despite the fact
that you two

07:41.168 --> 07:44.045
are utter canine recruit
failures,

07:44.047 --> 07:46.714
I welcome you to...

07:46.716 --> 07:49.341
The secret elite Star Paws
team?

07:49.343 --> 07:54.471
Alas, yes, we need two
new Star Paws agents, stat,

07:54.473 --> 07:56.515
and you're the only two
available.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.894
Wow, we're gonna be part
of the Star Paws team?

08:03.399 --> 08:07.444
You are sworn to protect
the universe from evil.

08:07.446 --> 08:11.156
Whoa, I hate evil so much.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.490
Me too.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.742
You must learn basic Star Paws
skills

08:14.744 --> 08:16.368
to complete your assigned
mission.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.413
I can't wait.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.249
Me too.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.916
Head to the elite
Star Paws command center

08:22.918 --> 08:24.752
to receive instructions.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.421
Oh, my space bacon strips.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.966
Our first mission, I just
can't wait.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.051
This is gonna be so cool.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.761
We're gonna complete
our first mission

08:34.764 --> 08:37.765
in flying frisbees,
Captain Fuzzface.

08:37.768 --> 08:43.020
I hope so, for the
sake of all the universe.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.898
Greetings, recruits
Skyfetcher and Spaceslobber,

08:45.900 --> 08:47.358
and congratulations.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.609
Thank you.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.945
Mighty space kibbles!

08:50.947 --> 08:54.199
I can't wait to receive
instructions for our mission.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.157
How's your sense of smell,

08:55.159 --> 08:57.368
recruits Skyfetcher and
Spaceslobber?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.369
We aced that test,
Agent Theodore.

08:59.371 --> 09:04.459
Yeah, we found that t-bone
steak in 15 seconds flat.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.044
Although our assignment
was to seek out

09:06.046 --> 09:07.462
an explosive meteorite.

09:07.464 --> 09:12.260
Yeah, but the t-bone smelled
way more deliciousnessness.

09:13.385 --> 09:16.512
Oh boy, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.223
What's our mission,
Agent Theodore?

09:18.225 --> 09:22.477
Your mission is to seek,
uncover, and retrieve a bone.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.853
If you can ever
find it, that is.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.397
A bone?

09:26.399 --> 09:30.109
Did you say bone?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.861
Do tell, Agent Theodore.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.323
Is this a t-bone we're
gonna be looking for?

09:35.325 --> 09:38.826
No, not a t-bone, you're
to seek, find, and retrieve

09:38.828 --> 09:43.498
a very special bone,
the Master Bone.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.917
Whoa, the Master Bone?

09:46.919 --> 09:50.463
Yeah, we're always
up for bones.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.549
Sounds like an
awesome first mission.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.759
Awesome yes, but
extremely dangerous too.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.430
Galactic treats,
we love danger.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.723
Not as much as we love treats.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.850
We're ready for
instructions, Agent Theodore.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.770
You will undergo Star Paws
canine development training

10:05.772 --> 10:08.647
and learn all you need to know
to succeed in your mission.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.109
Star Paws canine
development training?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.653
Yes, you two are not
quite ready for the mission,

10:14.655 --> 10:17.449
but you're the only two agents
we have.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.324
Total space hydrant.

10:19.326 --> 10:21.411
Where is everybody?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.539
They were dognapped by
the evil Marlon Butterpaws,

10:24.541 --> 10:26.833
our most demented arch-nemesis.

10:26.835 --> 10:27.751
Oh, right.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.631
Well, thankfully, you have us.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.382
More like unfortunately,
we have you.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.426
You're gonna need
much more training

10:37.428 --> 10:39.179
before you're ready
for your mission.

10:39.181 --> 10:42.431
Bones of Neptune, did
you hear that Billy June?

10:42.433 --> 10:46.685
We're like the best
agent duo in this place.

10:46.687 --> 10:50.898
Alas it is true, you're the
only agent duo in this place.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.233
Now without much ado,
you'll be appointed

10:53.235 --> 10:56.362
to our best secret
elite Star Paws agents.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.699
Cool kibbles,
sweet space treats.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.286
You'll receive lessons on how
to become a Star Paws agent.

11:03.288 --> 11:07.206
You will learn to sniff, spot,
and retrieve like the best.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.833
We'll be great retrievers.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.502
Yeah.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.878
Just remember, you're
training to retrieve

11:12.880 --> 11:18.050
the assigned mission object,
not random t-bone steaks.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.512
Oh yeah!

11:20.514 --> 11:21.720
We're on it.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.848
You will not be assigned
to the Master Bone mission

11:23.850 --> 11:26.684
until you finish your training.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.645
Is that clear?

11:28.647 --> 11:30.604
Super clear, Agent Theodore.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.358
Consider it done.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.526
Good.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.736
Now, I will assign
you your instructors.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.738
And if you thought your mission

11:38.740 --> 11:42.242
was extremely dangerous before,

11:42.244 --> 11:45.203
wait until you meet them.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.787
Whoa.

11:46.789 --> 11:51.584
Star Paws recruits, prepare
to meet your instructors.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.962
Whoa, Dr. Flatface McAdoo,

11:53.964 --> 11:56.296
the wildest daredevil in the
universe.

11:56.298 --> 12:00.676
The most amazing canine
pilot in the galaxy.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.887
And who are you
two kibble bags?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.348
I'm Star Paws
recruit Tony Skyfetcher.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.685
And I'm Star Paws recruit
Billy June Spaceslobber.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.397
I trust you two are here
on pooper-scooper duty?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.941
Oh no, Dr. Flatface McAdoo.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.234
We're here to prepare

12:17.236 --> 12:20.446
for our very first
Star Paws mission.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.489
We're here
for flight training.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.575
We need to be better pilots.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.118
Faster.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.954
In your dreams.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.415
I don't train cadets.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.417
Whoa, Dr. Flatface McAdoo.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.045
This is the coolest day my life.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.881
And mine.

12:37.883 --> 12:41.094
- It's like...
- A big bone.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.429
Sprinkled with kibbles.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.638
Covered in chocolate fudge!

12:46.640 --> 12:48.601
Instead, it's
Dr. Flatface McAdoo.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.145
In the pelt.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.228
Wolftastic meatballs.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.733
This is gonna be awesome.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.736
You two mutts think
you have what it takes

12:59.738 --> 13:03.781
to partner with the furrisome
Dr. McAdoo?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.868
- Yep!
- Totally!

13:06.870 --> 13:11.122
Very well, if you
truly have what it takes,

13:11.124 --> 13:12.709
you should be able to answer

13:13.749 --> 13:16.002
the following question
correctly.

13:16.004 --> 13:19.379
If you do, who knows?

13:19.381 --> 13:22.508
I might be impressed
enough to train you.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.676
Whoa, really?

13:24.678 --> 13:27.097
What's the question, Dr.
McAdoo?

13:27.099 --> 13:32.102
How many t-bone
steaks can you fit

13:32.104 --> 13:34.813
in a photospheric spiral
supernova?

13:34.815 --> 13:36.355
Oh, that's easy.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.316
Yeah, everybody knows
how many t-bone steaks

13:39.318 --> 13:43.195
you can fit in a photospheric
spiral supernova.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.406
Ha ha ha.

13:45.408 --> 13:50.413
Well, amaze me with
your acumen, recruits.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.747
Totally, Dr. McAdoo.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.873
The answer is: none.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.792
What?

13:56.794 --> 13:59.838
What do you mean, none?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.674
Yeah, the metric surface

14:02.676 --> 14:04.843
of a photospheric spiral
supernova

14:04.845 --> 14:07.055
is minus 90,000 megatrons.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.432
Therefore you can't fit
any t-bone steaks in it.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.435
Because it's not really there.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.645
Nope.

14:15.647 --> 14:20.525
But you can unfit 700,000
t-bone steaks.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.486
Yeah, or in other words,
if 700,000 t-bone steaks

14:23.488 --> 14:25.155
enter the photospheric
spiral supernova

14:25.157 --> 14:27.406
they become negatively charged.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.743
And they're immediately
transmuted to zero.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.954
Leaving behind a
stew-smelling stardust residue

14:33.956 --> 14:37.499
with a half-space-life
of 30 million trillion

14:37.501 --> 14:39.752
mega zillion ions.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.546
Which in dog years
is about three minutes.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.467
What about the
t-bone steak, Tony?

14:45.469 --> 14:47.218
No t-bone steaks.

14:47.220 --> 14:52.348
Wait, if that's correct...

14:52.350 --> 14:55.142
I must immediately call
Operating Officer Trixie.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.396
She's in charge of the
photospheric spiral supernova

14:58.398 --> 15:00.105
Star Paws station.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.735
All her coordinates must be
reprogrammed.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.874
Marlon Butterpaws
is at it again.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.584
Marlon Butterpaws?

15:20.586 --> 15:23.838
Whoa, who's Marlon Butterpaws?

15:23.840 --> 15:31.970
He's our archiest of
arch-nemesiseses.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.516
Greetings my canine nemesis.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.892
Here I am.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.811
The evilest of evils,

15:38.813 --> 15:41.730
the most powerful kitty in the
universe,

15:41.732 --> 15:43.109
Marlon Butterpaws.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.569
Whoa, we have an arch-nemesis?

15:46.571 --> 15:49.781
Cool bacon strips.

15:49.783 --> 15:54.370
I'm making great progress
on my ultimate evil plan.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.457
You will never succeed,
Marlon Butterpaws.

16:00.749 --> 16:03.085
We are training two
new great recruits

16:03.087 --> 16:06.424
to beat you at your own game.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.052
Who, those two fleabags?

16:11.096 --> 16:12.469
Don't make me laugh.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.013
Milk might start coming
out of my nose.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.267
I just had breakfast.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.102
That's funny.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.773
Milk always comes
out of my nose.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.900
Please don't waste your
time, Captain Fuzzface.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.362
No matter what you do, you
cannot stop me.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.282
We will.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.950
No you won't.

16:34.952 --> 16:40.290
Not with those two goofballs
as your best Star Paws agents.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.123
Ridiculous!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.877
Now the universe is mine.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.004
And you best get ready for it.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.550
Whoa, he's not kidding around.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.555
There is nothing you
can do to stop me now.

16:54.681 --> 16:59.892
The Master Bone will be mine!

16:59.894 --> 17:06.482
I'm gonna take over the galaxy.

17:06.483 --> 17:12.821
See ya later!

17:12.824 --> 17:15.616
Whoa, what are we gonna
do, Captain Fuzzface?

17:15.617 --> 17:19.161
It's about what you two are
going to do.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.412
Us?

17:20.414 --> 17:25.250
Unfortunately you two are our
only hope.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.337
Ah, right.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.380
Sweet.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.591
Report to Agent BLT at once.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.218
He will explain your mission.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.844
We haven't got much time.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.638
Greetings, recruits.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.016
Hey, Agent BLT.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.642
Woof to see ya.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.018
You must be briefed about
our archiest of arch-nemesis,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.230
Marlon Butterpaws.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.066
Cool.

17:46.900 --> 17:47.899
Do tell.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.359
He's a bonkers feline,

17:49.361 --> 17:51.276
hell-bent on taking
over the universe

17:51.278 --> 17:53.947
and destroying the
Star Paws forever.

17:53.949 --> 17:58.867
Uh, Agent BLT, why is Marlon
Butterpaws so bonkers anyway?

17:58.869 --> 18:00.620
His kind was created in a lab

18:00.622 --> 18:04.123
by combining all the
bonkers cat videos ever made

18:04.125 --> 18:05.876
into a single living cat.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.755
Whoa, he must be totally
bonkers then.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.966
Absolutely loony.

18:12.968 --> 18:16.260
So loony in fact he's been
known to ride cardboard boxes

18:16.262 --> 18:20.347
down slopes and play patty
cake at the same time.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.058
Whoa, totally crazy.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.103
Infinitely wacky.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.353
Incredibly weird.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.773
Danger to the universe.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.025
A total loose cannon.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.651
Whoa.

18:32.653 --> 18:36.989
And now he's looking
for the Master Bone.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.159
What is the
Master Bone, Agent BLT?

18:39.161 --> 18:42.036
The Master Bone is an
ancient bone of legend.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.413
It is so powerful
it can wipe out

18:44.415 --> 18:46.874
all of the galaxy's existence.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.250
Or create it.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.044
Whoever wields the Master Bone

18:50.046 --> 18:54.548
can make whatever
they desire just happen.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.885
Whoa, amazing chicken nuggets.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.764
Unfortunately, all our
best Star Paws agents

19:00.766 --> 19:03.432
have been dognapped
by Marlon Butterpaws.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.184
You are the only two left

19:05.186 --> 19:09.396
who can stand against that
powerful and very evil cat.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.399
Yeah, we'll get to
the bone first.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.276
Sure we will.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.904
Even though you failed
all your training tests

19:16.906 --> 19:19.990
we hope and pray that
deep down somewhere

19:19.992 --> 19:23.119
you have the capacity
to find the Master Bone

19:23.121 --> 19:28.040
and deliver us from the evil
claws of Marlon Butterpaws.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.124
Yep.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.085
The bone can only be found

19:31.087 --> 19:34.046
by amazing sniffers and
retrievers.

19:34.048 --> 19:38.093
For the universe is vast, and
the bone,

19:38.095 --> 19:42.596
even if it's a gig-enormous
dinosaur bone,

19:42.598 --> 19:45.682
it's well, it's just a bone.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.686
So you have to train
hard and quick.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.689
We will.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.190
We don't have much time.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.275
And Marlon Butterpaws is adamant

19:54.277 --> 19:57.194
about getting his
claws on that bone.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.363
Report to Agent Bumblety
at once.

19:59.365 --> 20:03.700
He will train your noses
to sniff out bones.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.497
Sir, yes sir, Agent BLT.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.873
So let's get started.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.044
I will fill the chamber
with different smells,

20:13.046 --> 20:15.587
and you will tell me
what you're smelling.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.631
Ready?

20:16.633 --> 20:17.841
Ready Freddy.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.594
What do you smell, recruits?

20:20.679 --> 20:23.306
Total farts.

20:26.017 --> 20:30.437
A delicious roast.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.729
Well, which one is it?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.731
Yeah, maybe it's roast.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.191
What do you say Billy June?

20:36.193 --> 20:41.199
No, on second thought I'm
gonna say totally farts.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.908
Oh boy.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.492
Well what was it, Agent BLT?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.872
Yeah, what was that smell?

20:48.874 --> 20:50.873
Bananas.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.542
That was pretty close.

20:52.544 --> 20:56.086
That wasn't close at all.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.632
How in all the galaxies
of the known universe

20:59.634 --> 21:03.637
am I going to train you in
time to beat Marlon Butterpaws?

21:04.847 --> 21:06.264
Oh, don't worry Agent BLT,

21:06.266 --> 21:08.391
we're confident we'll
beat him to the bone.

21:08.393 --> 21:12.144
Yeah, mountain-of-meatballs
confident.

21:12.146 --> 21:15.355
Goodie, I'm glad
you're confident.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.192
Nobody else around here is.

21:18.194 --> 21:22.113
Well, actually, there is one
canine in the whole universe

21:22.115 --> 21:23.823
that believes in you.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.533
Who is it, Agent BLT?

21:25.535 --> 21:28.830
A foolish canine by the
name of Zen Master Birdbutt.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.885
Like the smell of
bacon

21:44.887 --> 21:47.764
wafts into the morning breeze,

21:47.766 --> 21:52.352
so you have floated into my
energy field,

21:52.354 --> 21:54.813
Skyfetcher and Spaceslobber.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.146
Zen Master Birdbutt,

21:56.148 --> 21:58.982
the most incredible zen
master in the galaxy.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.442
Yes that's me.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.863
I am indeed he whom
you speak of.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.199
I am Zen Master Birdbutt.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.450
You he
really believe in us,

22:08.452 --> 22:10.327
Zen Master Birdbutt?

22:10.329 --> 22:14.582
You believe we can
accomplish this here mission

22:14.584 --> 22:18.085
and get to the Master Bone
before Marlon Butterpaws?

22:18.087 --> 22:19.423
Yes I do.

22:20.257 --> 22:23.674
You are the answer
to saving the universe

22:23.676 --> 22:26.009
from kitty domination.

22:26.011 --> 22:30.267
So it was written on the bacon
strips I had a for breakfast.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.892
And on my houndoscope page.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.353
Whoa.

22:35.355 --> 22:40.357
I will help you along
on your dangerous mission

22:40.359 --> 22:44.362
by teaching you the ancient
wisdoms of the yogi,

22:44.364 --> 22:49.324
the art of the ninjas, the
courage of the space samurai.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.162
Cool.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.496
Do we get to throw ninja stars?

22:53.498 --> 22:55.873
Wushu whip chains?

22:55.875 --> 22:56.874
No!

22:56.876 --> 22:58.625
Bummer.

22:58.627 --> 23:02.881
You are here to master
your dog senses.

23:02.883 --> 23:06.301
To become a true
Star Paws agent.

23:06.303 --> 23:09.261
You have a long way to go

23:09.263 --> 23:13.141
before you will reach
your full potential.

23:13.143 --> 23:17.812
I will train you in the
ways of the canine samurai.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.981
I believe you will
accomplish your mission

23:20.983 --> 23:22.401
in flying colors.

23:23.444 --> 23:27.029
You just need the
zen master lotus touch.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.157
What are you gonna teach
us, Zen Master Birdbutt?

23:29.159 --> 23:30.283
Front-paw kick?

23:30.285 --> 23:32.494
Paw-heel strike?

23:32.496 --> 23:35.162
Silly pups.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.917
Those are unnecessary for
accomplishing your mission.

23:38.919 --> 23:42.461
Instead you two
will need to sharpen

23:42.463 --> 23:45.340
your bone-retrieving noses.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.382
Oh yeah.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.052
You will use your mind

23:49.054 --> 23:53.389
to expand your olfactory
receptor in your brain.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.933
Oh, super cool.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.437
You will also use your mind

23:59.439 --> 24:03.650
to hopefully expand
your actual mind.

24:03.652 --> 24:05.943
Since your IQ tests have
revealed

24:05.945 --> 24:09.113
a lower-than-normal dog IQ.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.243
Actually you have more like
the IQ of a sea cucumber.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.663
I love sea cucumbers.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.334
I have met the recruits,
Captain Fuzzface.

24:22.336 --> 24:26.381
I believe in the power of
Skyfetcher and Spaceslobber.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.424
They are the chosen pups,

24:28.426 --> 24:32.386
the ones who can fetch the
Master Bone.

24:32.388 --> 24:36.391
For all the meatballs in the
galaxy, Zen Master Birdbutt,

24:36.393 --> 24:38.687
I sure hope you're right.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.563
You're playing with our lives.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.398
The destiny of the entire galaxy

24:43.400 --> 24:46.401
is in the hands of two
pooper-scooper pups

24:46.403 --> 24:51.363
who failed every single
Star Paws training test.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.533
They shall succeed.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.994
They will retrieve
the Master Bone

24:55.996 --> 24:58.997
before Marlon Butterpaws does.

24:58.999 --> 25:03.500
Are you absolutely,
positively sure?

25:03.502 --> 25:06.462
Sometimes the clouds
form over the river

25:06.464 --> 25:08.338
when it's still snowing.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.966
What does that mean,
Zen Master Birdbutt?

25:09.968 --> 25:11.510
It means...

25:14.638 --> 25:16.555
I have no idea.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.600
Oh boy, I hope
Officer Butterball

25:18.602 --> 25:20.267
can do something with these two.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.728
Time is of the essence.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.103
I fear what would happen

25:23.105 --> 25:26.442
if that feline gets his
paws on the Master Bone.

25:42.917 --> 25:47.923
Marlon Butterpaws, we have
located the Master Bone.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.592
Magnificent,
my trusty Tinkaroo,

25:51.425 --> 25:55.178
you are a bringer
of excellent news.

25:55.180 --> 25:59.099
Do tell, where is
the Master Bone?

25:59.101 --> 26:03.978
It's on a planet called
Location of the Master Bone,

26:03.980 --> 26:07.481
Alpha Centauri in
the Bubble Galaxy,

26:07.483 --> 26:12.152
and is reached by passing
through the Fizzle Black Hole.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.489
What, what did you say
the planet is called?

26:15.491 --> 26:18.409
It's called Location of the
Master Bone,

26:18.411 --> 26:21.206
Alpha Centauri, sir.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.959
Wait, are you saying the
Master Bone is on a planet

26:25.961 --> 26:28.838
called Location of the
Master Bone, Alpha Centauri?

26:29.839 --> 26:32.923
Yes, Marlon Butterpaws.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.508
Well why in the
whole wide universe

26:34.510 --> 26:38.054
we never thought of checking
there for the Master Bone?

26:38.056 --> 26:39.805
Oh, I did.

26:39.807 --> 26:40.642
You did?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.977
Wait, how long have you
known about the existence

26:43.979 --> 26:46.690
of Location of the Master
Bone, Alpha Centauri?

26:47.691 --> 26:52.028
Oh, about 7,000 trillion ions.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.489
And you just decided
to check it out now?

26:57.491 --> 26:58.991
No Marlon Butterpaws,

26:58.993 --> 27:03.537
I checked it out last
week and found the bone.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.539
But then I thought
you wanted to have fun

27:05.541 --> 27:08.375
looking for the bone
all over the universe.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.960
You know, being a cat and all.

27:09.962 --> 27:14.423
What, what's that got
to do with being a cat?

27:14.425 --> 27:17.384
I always see cats
on YouTube videos

27:17.386 --> 27:21.972
just chasing the same
laser light for hours,

27:21.974 --> 27:24.977
even though they totally
know they can't catch it.

27:25.979 --> 27:29.605
I imagine you find
that to be fun.

27:29.607 --> 27:31.775
Well, that is fun,

27:31.777 --> 27:35.027
but we are talking about
universe domination here.

27:35.029 --> 27:39.615
Of course, but a cat is a cat.

27:39.617 --> 27:43.577
I mean, you did have fun
scouring the universe

27:43.579 --> 27:47.039
looking for the
Master Bone, right?

27:47.041 --> 27:49.542
Well yes, of course I did.

27:49.544 --> 27:53.340
I'm just here to
serve, Marlon Butterpaws.

27:58.345 --> 28:00.469
Recruits Skyfetcher and
Spaceslobber,

28:00.471 --> 28:02.639
report to Officer Butterball.

28:02.641 --> 28:05.642
Intergalactic steaks,
Officer Butterball.

28:05.644 --> 28:08.353
This is the most
exciting day of my life.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.437
And mine.

28:09.439 --> 28:12.649
And my most underwhelming.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.691
Who are you two mongrels
supposed to be?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.236
We're recruits Tony Skyfetcher

28:16.238 --> 28:17.987
and Billy June Spaceslobber.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.530
We're here to be trained to...

28:19.532 --> 28:23.785
Oh yes, you are two runts
who don't know the first thing

28:23.787 --> 28:26.161
about being Star Paws agents.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.538
Yeah!

28:27.540 --> 28:29.373
Yeah, that's us.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.042
My assignment
is to train youse

28:31.044 --> 28:34.754
to be great agents in 17 hours.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.046
Whoa.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.216
You shall think like
a Star Paws agent.

28:38.218 --> 28:40.552
You shall live like
a Star Paws agent.

28:40.554 --> 28:42.636
Sniff like a Star Paws agent.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.430
Fetch like a Star Paws agent.

28:44.432 --> 28:48.267
And most importantly behave
like a Star Paws agent.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.393
Is that clear?

28:49.395 --> 28:50.853
Crystal,
Officer Butterball.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.980
Where
do we begin?

28:52.982 --> 28:57.945
We begin from
lesson one of 10,002.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.071
Dancing space daisies.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.948
I'll get the popcorn.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.824
Recruits Skyfetcher and
Spaceslobber,

29:03.826 --> 29:06.744
report to Agent Bumblety.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.414
The plan here is to
modify your cerebral cortex

29:10.416 --> 29:13.375
to match that of an
actual Star Paws agent.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.919
We can do that?

29:14.921 --> 29:18.338
We'll be turned into amazing
Star Paws agents in no time,

29:18.340 --> 29:19.716
Agent Bumblety?

29:19.718 --> 29:24.219
Alas, not even my
computers are that powerful.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.764
Shucks.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.515
But we'll do our best.

29:27.517 --> 29:31.145
Now recruits, pay
attention to your monitors.

29:32.271 --> 29:37.277
You will observe on the
computer screen a food item.

29:37.611 --> 29:38.985
A bone.

29:38.987 --> 29:41.821
- Lovely
- Succulent.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.698
Very good.

29:43.700 --> 29:48.705
Now, what would you do
if you found such a bone?

29:50.749 --> 29:51.706
Eat it of course.

29:51.708 --> 29:54.875
Devour it, obviously.

29:54.877 --> 29:55.709
W-what?

29:55.711 --> 29:58.755
What do you mean, devour it?

29:58.757 --> 30:01.757
What else would you do with
a bone if not gnaw on it good?

30:01.759 --> 30:05.678
Yeah, really, what else
is there to do with a bone?

30:05.680 --> 30:09.349
No no no no.

30:09.351 --> 30:14.356
You're supposed to retrieve
the bone, not eat it.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.480
Whoa.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.857
If something is to be
retrieved and not eaten,

30:18.859 --> 30:22.112
why would it be in the
shape of a bone?

30:22.114 --> 30:23.779
Coincidence?

30:23.781 --> 30:25.614
I don't think so.

30:25.616 --> 30:26.740
There!

30:26.742 --> 30:28.450
You're supposed
to rewire your brain

30:28.452 --> 30:30.786
to be able to find the bone

30:30.788 --> 30:33.789
and return it to Star Paws
headquarters.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.834
It's the Master Bone.

30:36.836 --> 30:40.880
A bone of incredible powers,

30:40.882 --> 30:43.674
beyond any other!

30:43.676 --> 30:45.259
It's not lunch.

30:45.261 --> 30:46.804
But it's gigantic.

30:48.682 --> 30:51.559
And
incrediblicious.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.728
For all the lasagna
in the universe.

30:55.730 --> 30:58.856
We got a lot more work to do

30:58.858 --> 31:02.528
if we want to beat Marlon
Butterpaws to the bone.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.488
Recruits Skyfetcher and
Spaceslobber,

31:05.490 --> 31:06.991
report to Dr. McAdoo.

31:07.826 --> 31:14.873
- Yes sir.
- Sir.

31:14.875 --> 31:19.669
We're back to get more
training, Dr. McAdoo.

31:19.671 --> 31:20.711
Did Operating Officer Trixie

31:20.713 --> 31:22.881
reprogram the photospheric
spiral supernova

31:22.883 --> 31:23.757
Star Paws stations coordinates

31:23.759 --> 31:26.008
according to our calculations,
Dr. McAdoo?

31:26.010 --> 31:28.886
She did, indeed.

31:28.888 --> 31:32.055
Oh, sweet potato
patties, how did that go?

31:32.057 --> 31:34.892
The photospheric spiral
supernova

31:34.894 --> 31:38.145
Star Paws station blew up.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.855
Oh, bummer.

31:39.857 --> 31:44.736
Agent Trixie lost all
her fur in the blast.

31:44.738 --> 31:48.907
She's floating in space,
completely bald.

31:48.909 --> 31:50.199
Totally toast.

31:50.201 --> 31:54.161
It will take us 70 ions to
rescue her.

31:54.163 --> 31:56.372
Oh, blasted tomatoes.

31:56.374 --> 32:01.376
And I suppose now I
have to train you two

32:01.378 --> 32:03.837
to save the universe.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.091
We're under attack!

32:06.093 --> 32:07.257
Awesome.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.802
This is the most fun I've had

32:08.804 --> 32:12.471
since our New Year's Eve
pooper-scooper party.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.307
Wa-hoo!

32:14.226 --> 32:16.726
Marlon Butterpaws
is back.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.103
He's pretty cool.

32:18.105 --> 32:20.354
Yeah, totally.

32:20.356 --> 32:25.362
May I remind you Marlon Butterpaws
is our enemy, recruits?

32:25.862 --> 32:27.112
Oh, right.

32:27.114 --> 32:31.949
Well well well, I got
news for you, Star Paws.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.826
Looks like I finally discovered

32:33.828 --> 32:36.328
the whereabouts
of the Master Bone.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.705
You have?

32:37.707 --> 32:38.998
It's not possible,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.209
we've had our best
agents on it for years,

32:41.211 --> 32:43.585
and they never
could find anything.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.380
That's because
Star Paws agents

32:45.382 --> 32:47.882
are dog-brained
fools, of course.

32:47.884 --> 32:51.135
I on the other hand
have a cat brain,

32:51.137 --> 32:54.805
therefore I am
much much smarter.

32:54.807 --> 33:00.228
You thought Marlon Butterpaws
couldn't find the Master Bone?

33:00.230 --> 33:04.023
It's a small universe when
you're a smart kitty like me.

33:04.025 --> 33:09.030
I'm going to take over
the universe.

33:12.451 --> 33:16.995
If I weren't
retired...

33:16.997 --> 33:19.998
Oh, I ought to...

33:20.000 --> 33:23.834
Oh, for for all the raw
deals in the universe,

33:23.836 --> 33:27.046
this feline makes me lose my Zen
cool.

33:27.048 --> 33:31.593
Oh, stop whining Star
Paws, it doesn't suit you.

33:31.595 --> 33:36.600
What does suit you is being
total losers.

33:38.769 --> 33:39.603
Whoa.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.520
Now if you fellows don't mind,

33:43.522 --> 33:47.234
I'm off getting my rapacious
little claws on the bone.

33:48.819 --> 33:53.864
Sayonara, dumb critters.

33:53.866 --> 34:02.998
We are in so much trouble.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.959
Tinkaroo, I trust
we are heading

34:04.961 --> 34:07.378
straight for the location
of the Master Bone,

34:07.380 --> 34:09.338
Alpha Centauri planet?

34:09.340 --> 34:14.094
Yes Marlon Butterpaws, but
we will not get to the planet,

34:14.096 --> 34:18.054
no matter how much we try.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.601
For all the stuffed mice in
the universe, why ever not?

34:21.603 --> 34:24.938
Well, because the
location of the Master Bone,

34:24.940 --> 34:29.027
Alpha Centauri is not there.

34:30.570 --> 34:31.693
What?

34:31.695 --> 34:33.402
What are you talking about,
Tinkaroo?

34:33.405 --> 34:36.989
The planet is not
where it should be.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.286
My little kitty brain is
about to explode, Tinkaroo.

34:40.288 --> 34:42.079
You must explain this to me.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.998
What do you mean the
Location of the Master Bone,

34:45.001 --> 34:46.960
Alpha Centauri
planet is not there?

34:47.920 --> 34:52.884
Simple, the Location of the
Master Bone, Alpha Centauri

34:53.385 --> 34:57.052
is an ancient planet that
has come into existence

34:57.054 --> 35:00.932
more than seven
trillion ions ago.

35:00.934 --> 35:05.269
And has since imploded, and
the Master Bone with it.

35:05.271 --> 35:09.106
What, you're telling me
there was a Master Bone

35:09.108 --> 35:12.401
and now there is no Master Bone?

35:12.403 --> 35:14.737
Precisely.

35:14.739 --> 35:19.744
There can be no bone since
there is no longer a planet

35:20.119 --> 35:24.165
named Location of the
Master Bone, Alpha Centauri.

35:26.460 --> 35:30.628
But you told me
there was a Master Bone.

35:30.630 --> 35:33.298
Yes, of course, as some point

35:33.300 --> 35:36.760
in the history of the cosmos
there was.

35:36.762 --> 35:41.097
Now, poof, it's gone.

35:41.099 --> 35:42.347
That's just great.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.391
How in the whole wide Milky Way

35:44.393 --> 35:47.061
am I gonna get my
claws on the Master Bone

35:47.063 --> 35:49.396
if the planet that
contained the Master Bone

35:49.398 --> 35:52.525
has been gone for
seven trillion ions?

35:52.527 --> 35:55.905
May I suggest a time machine?

36:04.331 --> 36:08.958
Captain Fuzzface, we have
finally located the Master Bone.

36:08.960 --> 36:12.545
Great, let's do it before
Marlon Butterpaws does.

36:12.547 --> 36:14.755
We cannot, Captain Fuzzface.

36:14.757 --> 36:17.175
Why ever not, Agent Theodore?

36:17.177 --> 36:21.932
Unfortunately that planet
is no longer in existence.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.391
What?

36:25.393 --> 36:28.269
Yes the bone was
on a planet called

36:28.271 --> 36:31.021
the Location of the Master
Bone, Alpha Centauri.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.858
It was an ancient planet
that has come into existence

36:33.860 --> 36:37.153
more than seven trillion ions
ago and has since imploded.

36:37.155 --> 36:39.363
And the Master Bone with it.

36:39.365 --> 36:44.077
Then it will be impossible
for Marlon Butterpaws

36:44.079 --> 36:45.119
to get to it.

36:45.121 --> 36:47.664
Never underestimate
a space kitty

36:47.666 --> 36:51.041
with universe
domination on his mind.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.711
I hear Marlon Butterpaws
is building a time machine

36:53.713 --> 36:55.921
to travel back
seven trillion ions

36:55.923 --> 36:58.133
and make it to the Location
of the Master Bone,

36:58.135 --> 37:00.092
Alpha Centauri.

37:00.094 --> 37:03.095
Oh boy, we must get
Skyfetcher and Spaceslobber

37:03.097 --> 37:06.266
in a time machine
as soon as possible.

37:06.268 --> 37:09.601
We have Dr. Henbrain
working on it right now.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.771
He's going to
retrofit your starship

37:11.773 --> 37:13.608
to travel back in time.

37:16.945 --> 37:20.070
You fetched us, Dr. Henbrain?

37:20.072 --> 37:23.782
Yes, we must
prepare you two to get to

37:23.784 --> 37:26.163
the Location of the Master
Bone, Alpha Centauri.

37:27.873 --> 37:30.414
The Location of the
Master Bone, Alpha Centauri?

37:30.416 --> 37:31.958
Where's that?

37:31.960 --> 37:33.918
Nowhere as of now.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.920
But we're about to
change all that.

37:35.922 --> 37:38.965
We're sending you
back seven trillion ions

37:38.967 --> 37:42.719
to retrieve a bone that
doesn't exist anymore.

37:42.721 --> 37:43.595
Awesome.

37:43.597 --> 37:44.429
Wait...

37:44.431 --> 37:45.387
What?

37:45.389 --> 37:47.389
We we are building a time pod

37:47.391 --> 37:50.226
which you will fly
across space and time,

37:50.228 --> 37:53.104
all the way to the Location
of the Master Bone,

37:53.106 --> 37:57.733
Alpha Centauri, that's where
you'll find the Master Bone.

37:57.735 --> 37:59.778
Milk bones and Milky Way.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.072
Oh that's amazing.

38:02.114 --> 38:06.034
Yes, you
will travel back in time,

38:06.036 --> 38:09.579
and you will arrive to the
Location of the Master Bone,

38:09.581 --> 38:15.084
Alpha Centauri during that
planet's Jurassic period.

38:15.086 --> 38:19.630
You mean a time of space
Tyrannosaurus, and...

38:19.632 --> 38:23.133
Galactic Triceratops, and...

38:23.135 --> 38:25.595
And Velociraptors, yes.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.929
Wowza.

38:26.931 --> 38:29.014
This is gonna be awesome.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.974
That's where the
Master Bone is.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.186
I mean was, before
the planet imploded

38:34.188 --> 38:36.563
seven trillion ions ago.

38:36.565 --> 38:39.775
Whoa, that's mine-bending
Dr. Henbrain.

38:39.777 --> 38:42.278
What Marlon Butterpaws
doesn't know

38:42.280 --> 38:44.447
is we can also build a time pod

38:44.449 --> 38:47.282
and beat him to the punch.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.911
I must figure out the
Master Bone Alpha Centauri's

38:49.913 --> 38:54.374
original coordinates then
teleport you to the past,

38:54.376 --> 38:57.251
where you'll sniff out,
snatch, fetch,

38:57.253 --> 38:58.836
and bring the bone back to us

38:58.838 --> 39:02.132
before Marlon Butterpaws
gets a chance to get it.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.675
Whoa, sounds like a plan.

39:04.677 --> 39:07.345
A meatball of a plan.

39:07.347 --> 39:08.720
We're so ready.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.932
In order to blast to the past

39:10.934 --> 39:13.392
you must first make it
to the Bubble Galaxy.

39:13.394 --> 39:17.354
Once there you will pass
through the Fizzle black hole.

39:17.356 --> 39:20.191
The black hole will
catapult you into the past,

39:20.193 --> 39:22.110
where you'll find the location

39:22.112 --> 39:24.820
of the Master Bone,
Alpha Centauri.

39:24.822 --> 39:26.113
All clear?

39:26.115 --> 39:28.117
- Sparkling.
- Darn tootin'.

39:31.288 --> 39:32.954
Captain Fuzzface.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.039
Admiral Squigglebuns.

39:35.041 --> 39:38.251
I heard that Marlon
Butterpaws is at it again.

39:38.253 --> 39:40.086
Is that true?

39:40.088 --> 39:41.545
Indeed he is.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.632
Marlon Butterpaws is always
up to something or other.

39:44.634 --> 39:47.635
He is a cat after all.

39:47.637 --> 39:52.432
Is it true he's trying to get
his paws on the Master Bone?

39:52.434 --> 39:56.436
Also Admiral Squigglebuns,
it is true.

39:56.438 --> 40:00.400
We cannot allow that pesky
feline to get to the bone.

40:01.275 --> 40:05.028
You hear me, Captain
Fuzzface, we cannot allow it.

40:05.030 --> 40:06.945
Yes sir, Admiral Squigglebuns.

40:06.947 --> 40:10.617
Well what is Star Paws
gonna do to prevent it?

40:10.619 --> 40:14.244
What are we gonna do, I'll
tell you what we're gonna do.

40:14.246 --> 40:18.416
We will beat Marlon
Butterpaws at his own game

40:18.418 --> 40:21.961
and retrieve the bone
before he does, that's what.

40:21.963 --> 40:26.382
Or my name is not Captain
Fuzzface IV.

40:26.384 --> 40:28.804
How exactly do you
intend to do that?

40:29.679 --> 40:31.970
I hear he's preparing
a time machine

40:31.972 --> 40:33.847
to get to the bone first.

40:33.849 --> 40:36.726
We will create a
time machine first.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.936
We will beat him to the bone.

40:38.938 --> 40:43.943
And who exactly is going to
go on such a risky mission?

40:44.568 --> 40:47.612
I hear Marlon Butterpaws
has pretty much dognapped

40:47.614 --> 40:51.157
all your best agents,
Captain Fuzzface.

40:51.159 --> 40:55.494
We're in the process of
training two great new agents

40:55.496 --> 40:57.956
as we speak, Admiral
Squigglebuns.

40:57.958 --> 41:01.918
Just incredible agents,
that they are.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.838
Are we talking about
Tony Skyfetcher

41:04.840 --> 41:06.965
and Billy June Spaceslobber?

41:06.967 --> 41:09.550
The pooper scoopers?

41:09.552 --> 41:13.429
Yes, Admiral Squigglebuns,
those are the ones.

41:13.431 --> 41:17.057
Oh, dog help us all.

41:17.059 --> 41:21.646
You cannot let that happen,
we must use our secret weapon.

41:21.648 --> 41:22.813
You mean?

41:22.815 --> 41:26.066
Yes, that's exactly
who I mean.

41:26.068 --> 41:29.445
But he, he's a loose cannon.

41:29.447 --> 41:32.158
He might be the only
chance we got, Captain.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.789
Skyfetcher, Spaceslobber.

41:39.791 --> 41:44.543
Despite the trust Zen Master
Birdbutt has placed in you two,

41:44.545 --> 41:49.423
I have my reservations.

41:49.425 --> 41:51.469
- Bummer.
- Ultimate drag.

41:52.429 --> 41:55.889
I just cannot entrust the
entire fate of the galaxy

41:55.891 --> 41:58.474
to two pooper-scooper recruits

41:58.476 --> 42:02.771
who failed every Star
Paws test ever created.

42:02.773 --> 42:07.358
And, I might add, who were
single-handedly responsible

42:07.360 --> 42:10.945
for the destruction of the
photospheric spiral supernova

42:10.947 --> 42:12.572
Star Paws station.

42:12.574 --> 42:15.365
I simply will not.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.075
Soggy kibbles.

42:17.077 --> 42:20.621
Well that just really
peed on my dog parade.

42:20.623 --> 42:24.458
Unfortunately I do not have
anybody who can replace you,

42:24.460 --> 42:26.376
given all our best active agents

42:26.378 --> 42:31.423
have been dognapped
by Marlon Butterpaws.

42:31.425 --> 42:33.133
Clue me.

42:33.135 --> 42:35.385
Therefore I have no option

42:35.387 --> 42:37.264
but to send you
two on the mission.

42:38.099 --> 42:42.519
But I have decided to
assign you a partner.

42:42.521 --> 42:43.811
A partner?

42:43.813 --> 42:44.647
Yes.

42:46.023 --> 42:49.191
I wouldn't dream of getting
him out of retirement

42:49.193 --> 42:51.735
if the situation were
not so critical

42:51.737 --> 42:55.322
as to command extreme remedy.

42:55.324 --> 43:00.202
He is a rough space
warrior of great repute.

43:00.204 --> 43:05.210
His name is Commander
Eugenius Calzone Tuffnut X.

43:07.378 --> 43:09.586
Wow, did you say...

43:09.588 --> 43:12.634
Commander Eugenius
Calzone Tuffnut X?

43:14.719 --> 43:17.554
The best Star Paws
agent that ever existed?

43:17.556 --> 43:18.720
Ever?

43:18.722 --> 43:20.472
The one.

43:20.474 --> 43:23.601
Liver sticks, Commander Tuffnut
fought every single battle

43:23.603 --> 43:26.146
ever fought since the beginning
of time.

43:26.148 --> 43:29.816
And before there was time he
fought outside time itself.

43:29.818 --> 43:31.985
He was at the Battle
of the Seven Planets

43:31.987 --> 43:34.278
against the mighty space hippos.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.990
He broke the space-time
barrier with a single burp.

43:37.992 --> 43:40.952
He is amazing.

43:40.954 --> 43:42.954
Well well well.

43:42.956 --> 43:45.248
Commander Tuffnut.

43:45.250 --> 43:48.501
- Commander Tuffnut.
- Commander Tuffnut.

43:48.503 --> 43:51.588
So Captain Fuzzface, these
are the pooper-scoopers

43:51.590 --> 43:53.255
you've seen fit partnering me
with

43:53.257 --> 43:55.883
for the most important
mission of my career.

43:55.885 --> 43:57.887
I apologize, Commander
Tuffnut, but...

43:59.014 --> 44:02.097
Very well, I hear
the galaxy is in peril

44:02.099 --> 44:04.057
and action must
be taken at once.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.813
Beggars can't be choosers,
they will do.

44:12.235 --> 44:15.528
Whoa, Commander Tuffnut.

44:15.530 --> 44:16.695
Whiskers and all.

44:16.697 --> 44:19.324
That's right,
I'm Commander Tuffnut.

44:19.326 --> 44:21.575
And never forget it.

44:21.577 --> 44:24.662
Are you ready to commence
space-time blast-off?

44:24.664 --> 44:26.079
- Ready.
- Ready.

44:26.081 --> 44:29.666
Now Skyfetcher, Spaceslobber,
Commander Tuffnut,

44:29.668 --> 44:34.088
upon blast-off you will travel
at 10,000 light-years speed

44:34.090 --> 44:35.507
towards Bubble Galaxy.

44:35.509 --> 44:39.219
Once there you will pass
through the Fizzle black hole.

44:39.221 --> 44:41.595
The black hole will catapult you

44:41.597 --> 44:44.307
seven trillion ions into the
past,

44:44.309 --> 44:46.851
where you will find the
Location of the Master Bone,

44:46.853 --> 44:48.436
Alpha Centauri.

44:48.438 --> 44:51.648
Remember to keep your nose
trained toward the Master Bone.

44:51.650 --> 44:54.483
Your mission is to find,
fetch, and retrieve it

44:54.485 --> 44:57.320
before Marlon Butterpaws gets to
it.

44:57.322 --> 44:58.530
That get through?

44:58.532 --> 44:59.697
Yes sir.

44:59.699 --> 45:01.115
Yes sir.

45:01.117 --> 45:03.494
Shut up you foolish
Dr. Simpleton.

45:04.746 --> 45:07.746
Don't you know who I am,
I am Commander Tuffnut.

45:07.748 --> 45:09.624
Don't tell me what to do.

45:09.626 --> 45:12.711
I was born with an internal
compass towards adventure.

45:13.547 --> 45:15.380
Let's get this puppy in the sky

45:15.382 --> 45:17.715
and let's kick some space butt.

45:17.717 --> 45:18.842
Whoa.

45:18.844 --> 45:21.427
Dog tootin'.

45:21.429 --> 45:23.472
Alrighty then.

45:36.610 --> 45:39.070
Whoa, Commander Tuffnut,
how did you ever defeat

45:39.072 --> 45:42.072
the invisible walrus army
in the Battle of Longtooth?

45:42.074 --> 45:45.577
I defeated them by doing
what I'm about to do to you,

45:45.579 --> 45:48.746
you puny little
pooper-scooping bag of fleas

45:48.748 --> 45:51.081
if you don't shut your muzzle.

45:51.083 --> 45:54.961
Whoa, Commander Tuffnut,
you're my hero.

45:54.963 --> 45:57.755
You bet your silly
little butt I'm a hero.

45:57.757 --> 46:00.675
I was fighting wars
before you were born.

46:00.677 --> 46:02.512
Now, let's get this
puppy speeding.

46:07.851 --> 46:10.267
Uh, Commander Tuffnut,
I think we're pushing

46:10.269 --> 46:12.269
10,000 light-years
per minute here.

46:12.271 --> 46:14.731
This craft can't go
any faster than that.

46:14.733 --> 46:17.441
Don't be a ridiculous
bag of treats.

46:17.443 --> 46:19.151
I've gone faster
riding a wheelchair

46:19.153 --> 46:20.695
down one of Saturn's rings.

46:20.697 --> 46:36.795
Let's push this baby to the max.

46:36.797 --> 46:39.046
What was that sound,
y'all reckon?

46:39.048 --> 46:40.632
Did we hit
space marbles?

46:40.634 --> 46:43.717
We are probably breaking
the speed of ultrasonic light.

46:43.719 --> 46:46.222
Yeah, now we are talking.

46:48.682 --> 46:50.141
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

46:50.143 --> 46:51.684
Uh-oh.

46:51.686 --> 46:55.729
Well well well, looks as if we
hit a snag.

46:55.731 --> 46:58.358
Yeah, the time machine is
stalled.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.318
We're stuck in space.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.860
Nothing a good jump won't fix.

47:01.862 --> 47:05.155
I eat stalled time machines
for breakfast.

47:05.157 --> 47:08.117
Yo, Sonny, what's
happening my friend?

47:08.119 --> 47:12.831
Yo Tuffnut, what solar winds
blow you around these parts?

47:12.833 --> 47:16.501
Eh, you know how it is, Sonny,
it's the wind of adventure,

47:16.503 --> 47:17.668
that's what it is.

47:17.670 --> 47:20.755
Blows this way and that, and...

47:20.757 --> 47:22.632
I thought you was retired.

47:22.634 --> 47:26.385
I was, I tried to leave the
life of peril and adventure,

47:26.387 --> 47:28.804
but these good-for-nothing
imbeciles

47:28.806 --> 47:30.597
can't get nothing
done without me.

47:30.599 --> 47:32.224
I hear you Tuffnut.

47:32.226 --> 47:34.269
Say, what can I do for you?

47:34.271 --> 47:35.436
I need a jump.

47:35.438 --> 47:37.438
A jump, where you at?

47:37.440 --> 47:40.191
Hey, you two dingle
brains, where are we at?

47:40.193 --> 47:41.693
According to our
calculations...

47:41.695 --> 47:44.028
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

47:44.030 --> 47:47.574
About to crash into the pits
of fire of Planet Lavatron.

47:47.576 --> 47:50.242
Right, uh, Sonny,
you heard him.

47:50.244 --> 47:51.577
We're in the middle of nowhere,

47:51.579 --> 47:54.789
about to crash into the pits
of fire of Planet Lavatron.

47:54.791 --> 47:57.333
So, you gonna give a good
friend a jump or what?

47:57.335 --> 48:00.043
Middle of nowhere, you say?

48:00.045 --> 48:03.298
Yeah I know that place of the
galaxy like the back of my paw

48:03.300 --> 48:04.758
but that's gonna cost you.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.633
Subatomic liquid nitrogen fuel

48:06.635 --> 48:08.762
doesn't come cheap these days.

48:08.764 --> 48:10.929
Uh, Commander Tuffnut?

48:10.931 --> 48:14.099
Just get me to Planet
Lavatron in one piece will you?

48:14.101 --> 48:17.519
I'll get this baby back in
tip-top shape in no time.

48:17.521 --> 48:19.773
I've got some
friends down there.

48:19.775 --> 48:21.651
Fine, but it's gonna cost you.

48:28.867 --> 48:31.867
Captain Fuzzface, where in
the world is the starship?

48:31.869 --> 48:34.748
They should have arrived
at the destination by now.

48:38.126 --> 48:40.796
I bring nefarious
news, Captain Fuzzface.

48:46.134 --> 48:49.094
What on Jupiter's
moons is going on?

48:49.096 --> 48:50.845
You three should have
made it back in time

48:50.847 --> 48:53.430
and to the Location of the
Master Bone Alpha Centauri

48:53.432 --> 48:54.599
by now.

48:54.601 --> 48:56.851
Just a minor setback,
Captain Fuzzface.

48:56.853 --> 49:00.521
Minor setback,
whatever do you mean?

49:00.523 --> 49:03.733
Uh, we're about to crash
onto Planet Lavatron,

49:03.735 --> 49:05.818
not a problem.

49:05.820 --> 49:07.778
Not a problem?

49:07.780 --> 49:10.782
Nah, nothing to worry
about, I've got this.

49:10.784 --> 49:14.452
The survival of the galaxy
depends on this mission,

49:14.454 --> 49:16.079
Commander Tuffnut.

49:16.081 --> 49:18.789
Uh, Commander Tuffnut?

49:18.791 --> 49:19.835
Five seconds to impact.

49:22.795 --> 49:24.420
What is
happening now?

49:24.422 --> 49:26.340
I think
we're crashing!

49:38.853 --> 49:43.188
Ah, here we are,
lovely as ever.

49:43.190 --> 49:49.612
Whoa, but now now
what Commander Tuffnut?

49:49.614 --> 49:50.863
Bugeyes, my friend.

49:50.865 --> 49:52.865
Commander Tuffnut.

49:52.867 --> 49:56.369
You look just like
you did 50 ions ago.

49:56.371 --> 49:58.746
Trying to keep up
with the times, Bugeyes.

49:58.748 --> 50:01.585
Now tell me, I'm on the market
for a nebulizatron 7000.

50:03.335 --> 50:05.171
A nebulizatron 7000,
they don't come cheap.

50:07.548 --> 50:09.590
Money is no problem.

50:09.592 --> 50:12.385
I got my Star Paws card with me,

50:12.387 --> 50:13.970
I'll put it on their tab.

50:13.972 --> 50:15.387
Just name your price.

50:15.389 --> 50:17.557
Uh, Commander Tuffnut?

50:17.559 --> 50:19.266
Captain Fuzzface
ain't gonna be

50:19.268 --> 50:21.519
none too pleased about that.

50:21.521 --> 50:24.521
Nonsense, we're saving
the galaxy aren't we?

50:24.523 --> 50:27.275
What's a few million bucks in
the grand scheme of things.

50:27.277 --> 50:31.070
Well, if that's the
case, say Beef,

50:31.072 --> 50:33.990
didn't we just get in some
top-of-the-line models?

50:33.992 --> 50:38.411
Oh yeah Hoss, I got some
stuff that'll get you flying

50:38.413 --> 50:42.373
like an overcharged photon.

50:42.375 --> 50:44.503
Magnificent, bring it on.

50:50.257 --> 50:54.302
Ah, sailing smoothly
once again.

50:54.304 --> 50:57.639
What did I tell you fellas,
I've got it covered.

50:57.641 --> 50:59.891
Whoa, you're the
best, Commander Tuffnut.

50:59.893 --> 51:02.769
We're on our way to the
Location of the Master Bone,

51:02.771 --> 51:04.354
Alpha Centauri.

51:04.356 --> 51:05.190
Wee-hoo!

51:08.025 --> 51:10.568
Way to go, Commander Tuffnut.

51:10.570 --> 51:13.947
That's right, you leave
it to me, you ain't seen...

51:13.949 --> 51:15.367
Hey, where did you go?

51:19.746 --> 51:23.123
Ah ha, I got you two
impossible fleabags.

51:23.125 --> 51:25.708
You were the
Star Paws last hope,

51:25.710 --> 51:29.003
and now you are in my claws.

51:29.005 --> 51:29.963
Whoa.

51:29.965 --> 51:32.173
For all the bacon
in the universe.

51:32.175 --> 51:34.508
Where are we?

51:34.510 --> 51:37.387
You are in my ship,
you goofy tailwaggers.

51:37.389 --> 51:39.472
You are my prisoners.

51:39.474 --> 51:41.724
Totally soggy buns.

51:41.726 --> 51:44.436
We've been dognapped.

51:44.438 --> 51:46.019
That's right.

51:46.021 --> 51:50.066
And now you will not be able
to continue your mission.

51:50.068 --> 51:54.612
And I, Marlon Butterpaws,
will find and snatch

51:54.614 --> 51:57.865
the master bomb
before anybody else.

51:57.867 --> 52:00.159
And nobody can stop me.

52:00.161 --> 52:04.956
Tuff luck, Star Paws!

52:04.958 --> 52:09.963
You're an evil genius,
Marlon Butterpaws.

52:11.088 --> 52:13.382
An evil genius indeed.

52:16.762 --> 52:19.137
Not so fast, milk breath.

52:19.139 --> 52:22.097
You have yet to meet
Commander Tuffnut.

52:45.831 --> 52:49.041
Hey, what in the Milk
Way is going on here?

52:49.043 --> 52:52.838
We've been hit, we're under
attack, Marlon Butterpaws.

52:54.423 --> 52:58.092
What, under attack,
who dares attack me?

52:58.094 --> 53:07.976
I dare, sardine brains,
Commander Tuffnut to the rescue.

53:07.978 --> 53:10.771
Hey, where did
my prisoners go?

53:10.773 --> 53:15.778
Meet my
Dematerialize 3000, goofball.

53:16.070 --> 53:17.655
Wait, what?

53:21.367 --> 53:23.284
Hey, we're back.

53:23.286 --> 53:24.827
Totally groovy.

53:24.829 --> 53:28.206
How was your stay,
kibble bags?

53:28.208 --> 53:29.874
They seem like nice folks.

53:29.876 --> 53:32.709
Didn't get a chance to
spend quality time though.

53:32.711 --> 53:37.548
Maybe next time fellas,
but now back to our mission.

53:37.550 --> 53:38.508
All right.

53:38.510 --> 53:40.217
Oh yeah!

53:40.219 --> 53:42.679
Yeah, Commander Tuffnut.

53:42.681 --> 53:43.764
Cool bones.

53:44.641 --> 53:47.266
Commander Tuffnut
leaves no one behind.

53:47.268 --> 53:50.228
Hey, who the furball are you?

53:50.230 --> 53:53.523
I'm your worst
nightmare, feline.

53:53.525 --> 53:54.358
Take this!

54:01.074 --> 54:02.615
Hey, quit that.

54:02.617 --> 54:04.117
Sorry, no can do.

54:04.119 --> 54:08.246
I'm having good of a time
ruffling your fur.

54:08.248 --> 54:10.914
Tinkaroo, arm the ionic
missiles.

54:10.916 --> 54:13.085
Engage the super sonic lasers.

54:14.963 --> 54:16.089
Catch me if you can.

54:42.449 --> 54:47.534
You are really getting on
my nerves now, buck teeth.

54:47.536 --> 54:51.456
Oh yeah, well you
ain't seen nothing yet.

54:51.458 --> 54:52.291
Whoa.

54:53.876 --> 54:57.170
That Commander Tuffnut,
he don't take no prisoners.

54:57.172 --> 54:59.296
Fire, fire Tinkaroo!

54:59.298 --> 55:03.550
Our warp fans have been
hit, Marlon Butterpaws.

55:03.552 --> 55:04.386
What?

55:07.056 --> 55:09.516
Engage the ionic lava lasers.

55:09.518 --> 55:13.269
Let's teach this wet nose
who he's dealing with.

55:13.271 --> 55:14.940
Yes, Marlon Butterpaws.

55:16.190 --> 55:19.025
I'm not done with
you, Marlon Butterpaws.

55:19.027 --> 55:20.318
Oh yeah?

55:20.320 --> 55:21.738
We'll take this.

55:46.137 --> 55:49.141
Missed me,
take that you ragged feline.

55:53.186 --> 55:54.394
Gotcha!

55:54.396 --> 55:56.438
Wow, it's like the most
exciting rollercoaster...

55:56.440 --> 55:57.648
Of our lives.

55:59.025 --> 56:03.778
You better quit your goofing
around rodent, all right?

56:03.780 --> 56:07.282
Quit, oh no I'm just getting
warmed up.

56:07.284 --> 56:11.869
I've got another trick up
my sleeve, you you cat.

56:11.871 --> 56:14.914
Oh yeah, I'd like to see that.

56:14.916 --> 56:19.668
Sayonara, anchovy breath,
see ya never.

56:19.670 --> 56:22.338
We're headed for the
Bubble Galaxy, guys.

56:22.340 --> 56:24.423
Warp speed engaged
at full power.

56:24.425 --> 56:26.342
Hold on to your butts.

56:26.344 --> 56:27.179
Wa-hoo!

56:28.304 --> 56:35.809
Weee-hoo!

56:35.811 --> 56:39.313
Here we are,
the Bubble Galaxy.

56:39.315 --> 56:41.648
Whoa, amazing.

56:41.650 --> 56:42.860
Super cool.

56:43.862 --> 56:45.360
Are we about to enter
the Fizzle black hole,

56:45.362 --> 56:46.862
Commander Tuffnut?

56:46.864 --> 56:48.822
I wouldn't dream of it.

56:48.824 --> 56:50.325
Why ever not?

56:50.327 --> 56:53.244
Cuz I ain't going
nowhere near a planet

56:53.246 --> 56:55.037
packed with gigantic
beasts without the help

56:55.039 --> 56:56.246
of somebody who can fight them.

56:56.248 --> 56:59.458
We need a guide.

56:59.460 --> 57:01.878
- A guide?
- Who is it?

57:01.880 --> 57:03.880
Take a left at that meteor
over there.

57:03.882 --> 57:26.443
Her home planet is three blocks
past the squishy supernova.

57:26.445 --> 57:28.570
Star Paws, where
have you been?

57:28.572 --> 57:31.657
Dognapped by Marlon
Butterpaws, Captain Fuzzface.

57:31.659 --> 57:34.452
Engaged in battle,
Captain Fuzzface.

57:34.454 --> 57:36.704
Just living the
rogue life, Captain.

57:36.706 --> 57:38.414
That is unacceptable.

57:38.416 --> 57:40.791
We're counting on you to
carry this mission out

57:40.793 --> 57:44.088
and beat Marlon Butterpaws
to the Master Bone.

57:44.965 --> 57:49.383
You cannot waste time engaging
in foolhardy skirmishes.

57:49.385 --> 57:52.429
Wish you'd been there
Captain, what a time we had.

57:52.431 --> 57:53.972
Right guys?

57:53.974 --> 57:55.347
Yeah.

57:55.349 --> 57:56.349
Total meatballs.

57:56.351 --> 57:59.894
Gotta go Captain,
not a moment to lose.

57:59.896 --> 58:01.563
Got a mission to accomplish.

58:01.565 --> 58:04.858
Hey wait just
a proto-second here.

58:04.860 --> 58:09.823
Adventure is in my blood.

58:11.032 --> 58:13.907
My blood is thick with thrills.

58:13.909 --> 58:15.702
Where are we heading,
Commander Tuffnut?

58:15.704 --> 58:19.204
Ah-ha, we are heading to
Planet Cornchip

58:19.206 --> 58:23.251
to pick up my great friend,
Princess Eugenia Marshmallow.

58:23.253 --> 58:25.420
Whoa, did you say...

58:25.422 --> 58:27.838
Princess Eugenia Marshmallow?

58:27.840 --> 58:30.467
The Princess Eugenia
Marshmallow?

58:30.469 --> 58:31.675
The very one.

58:31.677 --> 58:33.595
The hero of the war
of the Planet Verpal

58:33.597 --> 58:35.345
against the space rhinos?

58:35.347 --> 58:38.016
A war that raged
for ten trillion ions

58:38.018 --> 58:39.892
and saw three hundred battles?

58:39.894 --> 58:43.479
The Princess Eugenia
Marshmallow?

58:43.481 --> 58:45.442
Who won every single
one of them?

58:46.443 --> 58:47.483
Yep.

58:47.485 --> 58:48.319
Whoa.

58:49.820 --> 58:51.572
This is gonna be awesome.

58:59.414 --> 59:02.414
Commander Tuffnut,
nice to see you again.

59:02.416 --> 59:04.583
Ah, my princess.

59:04.585 --> 59:07.461
And who are these litter
runts you bring with you?

59:07.463 --> 59:09.505
I'm Tony Skyfetcher, Princess.

59:09.507 --> 59:12.300
And I'm Billy June
Spaceslobber.

59:12.302 --> 59:13.592
We're on a mission.

59:13.594 --> 59:15.135
A mission?

59:15.137 --> 59:18.807
Interesting, what kind
of mission?

59:18.809 --> 59:20.141
We're going to
fly our starship

59:20.143 --> 59:22.392
through the Fizzle black hole.

59:22.394 --> 59:24.354
In order to come out
the other side

59:24.356 --> 59:28.316
seven trillion ions
into the past.

59:28.318 --> 59:29.818
Where we will find

59:29.820 --> 59:32.320
the Location of the Master
Bone Alpha Centauri.

59:32.322 --> 59:36.699
Home of the ancient
and powerful Master Bone.

59:36.701 --> 59:38.659
Before evil space
cat Marlon Butterpaws

59:38.661 --> 59:40.119
can get his paws on it.

59:40.121 --> 59:43.373
And with it take
over the universe.

59:43.375 --> 59:46.876
Amazing, and what role are
you playing in all of this,

59:46.878 --> 59:48.378
Commander Tuffnut?

59:48.380 --> 59:50.088
I'm babysitting.

59:50.090 --> 59:52.465
Well I'm glad you
came by, Tuffnut.

59:52.467 --> 59:55.552
This sounds just like
my kind of adventure.

59:55.554 --> 59:58.929
I hope you will allow me
to join you in your quest.

59:58.931 --> 01:00:01.599
I was hoping you'd
say that, Princess.

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:04.644
With your warrior instincts
and fighting abilities

01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:06.019
you can help us

01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:09.566
come out of the Master
Bone, Alpha Centauri alive.

01:00:09.568 --> 01:00:11.066
What dangers await us

01:00:11.068 --> 01:00:14.112
on the Master Bone,
Alpha Centauri, Tuffnut?

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:16.363
Ravenous space Tyrannosaurus.

01:00:16.365 --> 01:00:19.575
Bloodthirsty galactic
Triceratops.

01:00:19.577 --> 01:00:23.537
All right, sounds just
like what the doctor ordered.

01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:24.833
Count me in.

01:00:27.126 --> 01:00:29.753
This is what I'm
talking about, guys.

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.963
This is what I was
trained to do.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.050
Adventure is what I do.

01:00:36.552 --> 01:00:41.389
You and I both,
princess, you and I both.

01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.932
This is totally awesome.

01:00:43.934 --> 01:00:47.561
Yeah, this beats
poop-scooping duty any day.

01:00:47.563 --> 01:00:50.440
Let's set course for the
Fizzle black hole crew,

01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:52.650
and let's get
blasted to the past.

01:00:52.652 --> 01:00:56.570
Fizzle black hole, no way.

01:00:56.572 --> 01:00:57.656
But Princess...

01:00:59.242 --> 01:01:03.494
I will not travel anywhere,
not the past, not the future,

01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:05.537
without first getting
my hair blow-dried

01:01:05.539 --> 01:01:07.539
and my claws manicured.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:11.503
I will not be seen in public
looking unprincess-like.

01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:22.764
Ah-ha, we meet again,
foolish canines.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.724
Guess what, I'm on my way to

01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:27.519
the Location of the Master
Bone, Alpha Centauri.

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:31.606
But before I do, I think
I'm gonna get rid of you

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.235
once and for all!

01:01:38.572 --> 01:01:42.159
Oh yeah, you seemed to
have a tough go last time.

01:01:43.369 --> 01:01:47.037
That's before I
installed my ultrapodic

01:01:47.039 --> 01:01:48.414
freezing gamma rays

01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:51.834
foolish quadrupeds!

01:01:51.836 --> 01:01:52.670
Marlon Butterpaws,
I'm not impressed.

01:01:56.550 --> 01:02:01.054
Oh yeah, then allow me to
impress you thoroughly then.

01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:03.807
Ultrapodic gamma rays, engage!

01:02:19.614 --> 01:02:21.030
We're hit!

01:02:21.032 --> 01:02:23.282
Oh, gloomy space bones.

01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:25.702
Engage the
atomic blasters, flea bags.

01:02:25.704 --> 01:02:27.744
Time to dive for the black hole

01:02:27.746 --> 01:02:30.623
and out of
Marlon Butterpaws' claws.

01:02:30.625 --> 01:02:32.416
No way.

01:02:32.418 --> 01:02:35.628
We're not going anywhere
near that black hole.

01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:37.130
But Princess.

01:02:37.132 --> 01:02:40.467
No buts, bones, or
barks, Commander Tuffnut.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:43.510
We're going to the
lower galactic quadrant.

01:02:43.512 --> 01:02:46.139
I know a little salon there
where they'll fluff me up

01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:48.182
in the wag of the puppy's tail.

01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:51.644
What in Uranus is
going on, crew?

01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:53.646
You should be back
in the Jurassic period

01:02:53.648 --> 01:02:55.733
looking for the
Master Bone by now.

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:59.360
Coordinates tell me you're
still in the present,

01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:02.112
just wandering aimlessly
from galaxy to galaxy

01:03:02.114 --> 01:03:03.907
like a pack of stray mongrels.

01:03:03.909 --> 01:03:05.909
And who in the woof are you?

01:03:05.911 --> 01:03:08.288
I'm Captain Fuzzface IV.

01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:10.954
Identify yourself.

01:03:10.956 --> 01:03:13.210
I'm Princess Eugenia
Marshmallow X,

01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:17.836
and I got you beat by six
generations of myself.

01:03:17.838 --> 01:03:22.008
And I'm not going anywhere
until I get my sass on.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.092
What?!

01:03:23.094 --> 01:03:25.552
You heard me right, Fuzzface.

01:03:25.554 --> 01:03:27.679
I don't care where
adventure takes me.

01:03:27.681 --> 01:03:32.645
What I care about is that I
look good when I get there.

01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.229
Any questions?

01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:36.648
But, but...

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:37.773
Ouch.

01:03:37.775 --> 01:03:40.111
Marlon Butterpaws
means business this time.

01:03:40.903 --> 01:03:43.530
Crew, what is going on here?

01:03:43.532 --> 01:03:46.365
The future of the
galaxy is in your paws,

01:03:46.367 --> 01:03:48.784
and you still haven't
made it to the past.

01:03:48.786 --> 01:03:51.787
Admiral Squigglebuns, the
past will have to wait.

01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:54.374
We've got a princess who
needs to get her sass on,

01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:56.583
and Marlon Butterpaws
has trained his

01:03:56.585 --> 01:03:59.128
ultrapodic gamma rays on us.

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:00.380
What?

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:03.300
That is absolutely
inconceivable.

01:04:04.844 --> 01:04:07.470
Conceived this, silly canines.

01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:09.722
Who is this ridiculous feline?

01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:12.851
trying to keep me from
getting my fur done?

01:04:12.853 --> 01:04:14.894
I'm Marlon Butterpaws,

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:18.525
and this is where you meet
your demise, kibble bags.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:26.575
This is unacceptable,
unthinkable, unconscionable.

01:04:26.867 --> 01:04:30.745
You must make it to the past
and fetch that bone now!

01:04:32.038 --> 01:04:33.912
No can do, Captain Fuzzface,

01:04:33.914 --> 01:04:36.749
got my paws quite full
at the moment.

01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:39.126
Wa-hoo!

01:04:39.128 --> 01:04:41.086
That was close.

01:04:41.088 --> 01:04:43.923
We're diving for that
black hole, Princess,

01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:46.050
your fur's going to
have to wait.

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:49.554
I protest, do you
realize what the humidity

01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:52.849
in the Jurassic will
do to my gorgeous pelt?

01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:56.519
Oh I wouldn't worry
about your pelt, princess.

01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:59.188
You're not going anywhere
near that black hole

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:02.941
or the Location of the
Master Bone, Alpha Centauri.

01:05:02.943 --> 01:05:07.155
Oh yeah, how are you
going to stop us?

01:05:07.157 --> 01:05:09.824
You will see soon
enough, silly creature.

01:05:09.826 --> 01:05:12.494
Engage the galactic freezatron.

01:05:12.496 --> 01:05:15.874
Galactic freezatron enraged.

01:05:37.228 --> 01:05:38.894
We're frozen in time.

01:05:38.896 --> 01:05:43.148
More like, we're frozen
in space.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:46.360
Let us go right now,
sardine breath.

01:05:46.362 --> 01:05:49.530
My pelt is frizzing as we speak.

01:05:49.532 --> 01:05:52.909
You're prisoners of
my galactic freezatron.

01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:53.829
How you like that?

01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:57.790
And now if you silly
goofballs don't mind,

01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:03.795
I'm on my merry way to
the past to get my bone.

01:06:03.797 --> 01:06:07.882
While you hang
there for eternity.

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:14.264
I hope you brought a snack.

01:06:14.266 --> 01:06:16.932
Not so fast, silly feline.

01:06:16.934 --> 01:06:20.353
Commander Tuffnut Has an old
dog's trick up his sleeve.

01:06:20.355 --> 01:06:22.813
- You do?
- Whoa!

01:06:22.815 --> 01:06:25.775
Super cool bacon strips.

01:06:25.777 --> 01:06:28.153
Ha ha, don't make me laugh,

01:06:28.155 --> 01:06:30.737
foolish bag of odiferous fur.

01:06:30.739 --> 01:06:35.034
Oh yeah, well laugh
at this, kibble brain.

01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:36.911
Engage beaming blasters.

01:06:36.913 --> 01:06:38.162
Oh yeah.

01:06:38.164 --> 01:06:40.541
Beaming blasters engaged.

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:45.128
Hey
wait just a proton minute.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:46.882
Where do you think you're going?

01:06:49.967 --> 01:06:52.427
Sayonara, loser.

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:55.974
This is starting to look like
my kind of adventure, guys.

01:06:56.974 --> 01:06:58.516
Cosmic.

01:06:58.518 --> 01:06:59.936
Totally cosmic.

01:07:01.813 --> 01:07:05.315
There she goes, the
goal is within our reach.

01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:08.233
Let's get the
show on the road, shall we?

01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:11.945
Yeah,
the bone is ours!

01:07:11.947 --> 01:07:12.988
Here we are, crew.

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.742
It's time to get our adventure
hats on.

01:07:15.744 --> 01:07:17.034
You know me.

01:07:17.036 --> 01:07:18.994
Which way is the bone?

01:07:18.996 --> 01:07:20.412
Hmm.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.668
Figure that way?

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:26.505
Hmm.

01:07:29.173 --> 01:07:31.550
- I'd say...
- We've got company!
