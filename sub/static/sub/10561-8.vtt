01:05.926 --> 01:08.828
Good morning, ladies. I trust
you are prepared for another day

01:08.895 --> 01:10.930
serving at Eaton and Company,

01:10.998 --> 01:14.833
Canada's Greatest Store.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.803
And remember, you are
ladies serving ladies.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.006
Which means, Miss Richardson,

01:21.073 --> 01:23.074
no loafing behind the counter,

01:23.143 --> 01:26.578
no engaging in idle
chatter. Isn't that right?

01:26.646 --> 01:28.380
Yes, Mr. Monk.

01:28.448 --> 01:31.849
Miss Richardson, the ladies of Rosedale

01:31.916 --> 01:33.951
do not want to be served
by a cow chewing her cud.

01:36.522 --> 01:39.823
And as for the rest of you,
I implore you to refrain

01:39.891 --> 01:43.628
from using common familiarities.
Our esteemed customers

01:43.695 --> 01:46.296
do not wish to be referred
to as 'dearie.' And, please,

01:46.364 --> 01:48.998
no "heaven help me" looks
exchanged while serving.

01:49.066 --> 01:52.269
- What do I expect at all times?
- Decorum, Mr. Monk.

01:52.336 --> 01:54.604
We are Mr. Timothy's ambassadors.

01:54.672 --> 01:58.741
Decor-um. Thank you, Miss Redmond.

02:00.844 --> 02:02.844
Miss Sykes.

02:02.912 --> 02:05.147
Your services will no longer be required.

02:05.215 --> 02:08.750
Sir... I can't afford not to
work. Why are you firing me?

02:08.818 --> 02:10.952
You know perfectly well.

02:11.020 --> 02:14.122
I do not make the rules,
I merely follow them.

02:14.191 --> 02:16.058
Collect your wages on your way out.

02:16.125 --> 02:19.160
Pompous prig.

02:19.228 --> 02:21.229
What are you staring at?

02:21.297 --> 02:23.431
- Flo, I'm very sorry...
- Save your sympathies, Helen.

02:23.499 --> 02:26.401
Monk'll get his one of these days.

02:26.468 --> 02:29.937
I can't fathom how Flo thought she
could pull one over on Mr. Monk.

02:30.005 --> 02:32.940
She was foolish to waste
the chance she was given.

02:33.008 --> 02:36.577
Good morning, ladies.

02:39.514 --> 02:42.649
- Oh, that looks beautiful, doesn't it?
- What do you think of this one?

02:42.717 --> 02:44.851
Oh, no. For you, Miss, these.

02:46.187 --> 02:48.955
You came back for the cream,
didn't you? I just knew you would.

02:55.295 --> 02:58.598
Did you see that Mrs. eyeing the hat
pins? She was about to help herself.

02:58.665 --> 03:00.866
Till Eva closed the case right smartly.

03:00.934 --> 03:03.502
She almost took off her finger!

03:45.776 --> 03:47.843
What are you doing here?

03:51.649 --> 03:55.284
Mr. Preston Monk, sir.

03:55.351 --> 03:58.487
He was the manager of The Eaton
Company's Ladies Wear Department.

03:58.554 --> 04:01.390
The stock boy found him
first thing this morning.

04:01.457 --> 04:05.827
- George, was this open like this?
- Yes.

04:05.895 --> 04:09.063
That's unusual. The safety
mechanism should have prevented that.

04:18.139 --> 04:21.608
- It was jammed.
- Also unusual.

04:21.677 --> 04:25.313
- Sabotage...
- Murder.

04:26.497 --> 04:30.719
- Awful business, Inspector.
- Had Preston Monk worked here long, Mr. Eaton?

04:30.717 --> 04:33.685
About a year. My father brought
him over from Harrods in London.

04:33.753 --> 04:36.255
He was helping to train the shop
girls, give them a bit of polish.

04:36.322 --> 04:40.359
Not an easy task, though they're
working hard to be more genteel.

04:40.426 --> 04:43.996
- What sort of man was Monk?
- An exemplary employee.

04:44.063 --> 04:47.199
- Always had the best interests of Eaton's at heart.
- A hard taskmaster?

04:47.267 --> 04:50.134
When he had to be. Most of
these girls came in lacking

04:50.202 --> 04:52.536
even basic social graces.

04:52.604 --> 04:55.572
Ladies, ladies, attention, please.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.109
- This is Inspector Blackenreid...
- Brackenreid.

04:58.176 --> 05:00.311
Brackenreid... he and his men

05:00.379 --> 05:02.713
will be conducting an investigation
into Mr. Monk's tragic death.

05:02.781 --> 05:04.714
You are to give him your full cooperation.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.716
Ladies.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.019
- Inspector.
- In the meantime,

05:09.086 --> 05:12.222
Ladies Wear will conduct business as usual.

05:12.290 --> 05:15.225
Miss Pearce, can I ask you
to act as interim manager?

05:15.293 --> 05:18.228
- Of course, Mr. Eaton.
- What a surprise.

05:18.296 --> 05:22.131
- I won't disappoint you, sir.
- Thank you, Miss Pearce.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.060
I know I can rely on your
discretion in this matter.

05:24.061 --> 05:25.161
Our customers need not know

05:25.162 --> 05:28.370
the details of Mr. Monk's sudden departure.

05:28.438 --> 05:31.807
- Inspector...
- Mr. Eaton.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.594
A moment, Miss...

05:36.662 --> 05:38.462
Helen Richardson.

05:38.530 --> 05:41.532
You don't think much of
Miss Pearce's promotion?

05:41.600 --> 05:44.535
Pearl should've been made manager.
She's been here the longest.

05:44.603 --> 05:47.638
Why did Mr. Eaton choose Miss Pearce?

05:47.706 --> 05:50.208
Whatever Eva wants, Eva gets,

05:50.275 --> 05:52.275
Inspector.

05:52.343 --> 05:54.578
Thank you.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.946
- Dr. Grace.
- Yes, Detective Murdoch.

05:57.014 --> 05:58.582
I'm finished here.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.351
- Can the body be taken to the morgue?
- Yes.

06:01.419 --> 06:03.886
Thank you, Doctor. Can I help you?

06:03.954 --> 06:06.590
You are?

06:06.657 --> 06:08.557
Jake Barker.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.593
Ah yes.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.861
- You operate this elevator.
- Yes.

06:12.929 --> 06:14.930
And you also care for its maintenance?

06:14.997 --> 06:16.765
Yes. Every night.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.935
Curious then. Perhaps you can tell me why

06:20.002 --> 06:22.137
I found the safety mechanism to be jammed.

06:22.205 --> 06:24.072
Monk...

06:24.140 --> 06:26.674
He could never leave the thing alone.

06:26.742 --> 06:30.044
Complained it made a racket,
disturbed his precious customers.

06:30.112 --> 06:32.647
I told him not to go messing with it.

06:32.715 --> 06:35.450
So you believe Mr. Monk opened the gate?

06:35.517 --> 06:37.852
He always thought that he
knew better than all of us.

06:37.919 --> 06:40.787
Does anyone else operate this elevator?

06:40.855 --> 06:43.089
No sir. Just me.

06:44.492 --> 06:46.760
I can't believe Mr. Monk's dead.

06:46.827 --> 06:49.296
It's so very, very horrible.

06:49.364 --> 06:52.766
So Mr. Monk was in the habit of
checking the department before he left?

06:52.833 --> 06:55.636
It seems he's turned out
the lights for the last time.

06:55.703 --> 06:58.904
You are taking his untimely
death rather calmly, Miss...

06:58.972 --> 07:02.708
I don't cry easily, sir.
But when I do, it's private.

07:02.776 --> 07:06.178
Certainly Mr. Monk wouldn't
approve of the public displays.

07:06.246 --> 07:09.448
Nevertheless, Miss Pearce,

07:09.516 --> 07:11.617
you may need this.

07:11.685 --> 07:14.118
You must have a quite a
collection of handkerchiefs,

07:14.186 --> 07:16.521
handing them to every woman in distress.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.825
Thank you anyway.

07:27.533 --> 07:30.200
Are you sure you don't want to read
these before they go to Darcy's lawyer?

07:30.268 --> 07:30.716
I'm quite sure.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.436
It's not every day
you're named co-respondent

07:33.438 --> 07:37.574
in a divorce proceeding.
It's your last chance.

07:37.642 --> 07:40.678
- Dr. Ogden!
- Dr. Grace.

07:40.745 --> 07:43.814
How fortuitous. I was about to share
my results with Detective Murdoch.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.350
- Why don't you join us?
- I'd be delighted.

07:47.418 --> 07:50.820
Multiple contusions, largely
to the left side of his torso,

07:50.887 --> 07:53.189
which received the brunt of the impact.

07:53.256 --> 07:55.625
His left arm was broken in two places,

07:55.693 --> 07:58.227
his hip and left ankle badly fractured.

07:58.295 --> 08:00.229
And this.

08:00.297 --> 08:03.932
- May I, Dr. Grace?
- Please.

08:03.999 --> 08:07.035
A most unusual wound.

08:07.102 --> 08:10.772
- I noted that.
- Whatever he came into contact with

08:10.840 --> 08:12.407
had a very specific shape.

08:12.475 --> 08:16.610
Hm. Have you a time of death, Doctor?

08:16.678 --> 08:19.347
Considering rigor mortis,
somewhere between 6 and 8 PM.

08:19.414 --> 08:21.281
Very good.

08:21.350 --> 08:23.551
This has been an illuminating visit,

08:23.618 --> 08:25.720
- but I must go.
- Do you miss the morgue,

08:25.787 --> 08:28.589
Dr. Ogden?

08:28.657 --> 08:31.225
I can't honestly say that I do.

08:31.292 --> 08:34.293
And I'm so happy to see
it in such capable hands.

08:34.361 --> 08:38.365
I'll leave you both to your corpse.

08:46.607 --> 08:51.943
You said Mr. Monk hit
something very specific?

08:52.011 --> 08:54.413
I did, Detective.

08:54.481 --> 08:55.981
Hmm.

08:56.048 --> 08:58.617
Right then, George.

08:58.685 --> 09:00.819
We're looking for something
five-sixteenths of an inch

09:00.887 --> 09:02.954
by one-and-an-eighth inch.

09:03.022 --> 09:05.923
Well, sir, there are all
sorts of nuts and bolts

09:05.991 --> 09:09.527
and this's and that's he could hit on
the way down, but not much blood evidence.

09:09.595 --> 09:13.197
With a head injury, as you know,
sir, you bleed like a stuck pig.

09:13.265 --> 09:17.034
That's a very good point, George.

09:17.102 --> 09:19.937
Perhaps we should expand our search.

09:41.224 --> 09:43.058
George.

09:43.126 --> 09:45.928
Sir?

09:47.898 --> 09:50.433
Blood.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.703
Monk was killed here,
by a blow to the head.

09:56.704 --> 09:58.354
Then thrown down the elevator shaft.

09:58.407 --> 10:00.708
An attempt to make it
look like an accident.

10:00.776 --> 10:03.778
- Seal off the area.
- Sir.

10:05.781 --> 10:07.749
I'm just a working girl
trying to hold down a job,

10:07.817 --> 10:09.817
I don't know anything about any murder.

10:09.884 --> 10:12.018
How long have you worked for Mr. Monk?

10:12.086 --> 10:15.188
Four months. Four long months.

10:15.256 --> 10:17.791
What do you mean?

10:17.859 --> 10:19.993
He has these ways.

10:20.061 --> 10:22.963
He wanted us to become 'ladies'.

10:23.030 --> 10:25.832
And I tried as hard as I could,
but he always found fault.

10:25.899 --> 10:29.134
And did he treat all of
the girls the same way?

10:29.202 --> 10:32.805
- All except Eva.
- I'm sorry?

10:32.873 --> 10:36.776
Eva Pearce. I'd never be
like Miss Perfect Pearce.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.345
Her flaunting herself the way she does.

10:39.412 --> 10:41.346
Well then, you must be relieved

10:41.413 --> 10:43.615
that Mr. Monk is no longer
alive to torment you.

10:43.683 --> 10:46.651
I lived in fear that he'd let
me go, but I didn't kill him.

10:46.719 --> 10:48.854
I wouldn't go near that elevator.

10:48.921 --> 10:51.289
Scares me to death, that thing.

10:51.357 --> 10:55.126
I see. Where were you
last night between 6 and 8?

10:55.194 --> 10:58.328
I went home. There's 6 of us there.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.698
I look after the youngsters
when Mam works the night shift.

11:00.765 --> 11:03.601
Thank you.

11:03.668 --> 11:07.037
Between 6 and 8? I was out with the girls.

11:07.105 --> 11:09.406
I understand Mr. Monk was demanding,

11:09.474 --> 11:11.441
sometimes even demeaning.

11:11.510 --> 11:13.376
Did you find him to be so?

11:13.443 --> 11:15.945
I appreciated what he
was trying to do for us.

11:16.013 --> 11:17.914
Mr. Monk was raising us up.

11:17.982 --> 11:20.483
Teaching us better ways of
talking, manners and such.

11:20.551 --> 11:25.054
He told me I had potential if I was
more like Eva. But no one's like Eva.

11:32.128 --> 11:34.462
- Oh, Miss Pearce?
- Yes.

11:34.531 --> 11:36.532
Detective Murdoch.

11:36.599 --> 11:38.967
I met Inspector Brackenreid.

11:39.035 --> 11:40.636
Your superior, I assume.

11:41.671 --> 11:45.006
Yes. Yes, he is.

11:45.073 --> 11:47.307
He seems an affable sort.

11:47.375 --> 11:50.645
I don't know how we
can help you, Detective.

11:50.712 --> 11:52.547
None of us would kill Mr. Monk.

11:52.614 --> 11:54.649
If you're looking for a suspect,

11:54.716 --> 11:58.318
Mr. Eaton can supply you with a
list of employees Mr. Monk dismissed.

11:58.386 --> 12:01.788
And may I ask where you were
last evening between 6 and 8?

12:01.856 --> 12:04.791
Do I need an alibi?

12:04.859 --> 12:07.027
It's just a routine question.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.329
I've watched you, Detective.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.699
You seem anything but routine.

12:14.669 --> 12:16.902
If you could please answer the question.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.972
I was with Pearl and the other girls.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.174
We arranged to have a consoling gin

12:22.241 --> 12:24.176
with Florence Sykes.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.879
And what was her mood last night?

12:26.947 --> 12:30.883
I don't know. She never showed up.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.055
Florence Sykes?

12:37.122 --> 12:40.091
- Who's asking?
- Detective William Murdoch,

12:40.158 --> 12:42.126
Toronto Constabulary.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.896
You were let go from the
Eaton's Department Store, yes?

12:44.964 --> 12:47.832
- When did that become a crime?
- It's not.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.833
But murder is.

12:49.901 --> 12:51.868
Mr. Monk was killed last night.

12:51.936 --> 12:55.239
Oh God.

12:55.307 --> 12:57.774
Miss Sykes, why were you dismissed?

12:57.842 --> 12:59.577
I tried to stop him. Really I did...

12:59.644 --> 13:02.379
- Stop whom?
- My husband, Jim.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.381
It's against Eaton company policy

13:04.449 --> 13:06.716
to hire married women, so he fired me.

13:06.783 --> 13:08.884
And your husband found out about it.

13:08.952 --> 13:11.488
He stormed off to give Monk a piece
of his mind. I tried to stop him.

13:11.555 --> 13:13.990
Where might I find Mr. Sykes?

13:16.760 --> 13:19.596
Mr. Sykes?

13:19.663 --> 13:23.532
- Mr. Sykes.
- Yeah?

13:23.600 --> 13:28.003
What business did you have
with Preston Monk last night?

13:28.070 --> 13:31.373
- Who the blazes are you?
- Detective Murdoch.

13:31.441 --> 13:34.109
Toronto Constabulary. Answer me.

13:36.446 --> 13:39.380
Yes, I went there. So what?

13:39.448 --> 13:42.150
That bastard treated my
Flo like a piece of dirt.

13:42.217 --> 13:44.585
He dismissed your wife, so you killed him.

13:44.653 --> 13:46.854
What do you mean?

13:46.921 --> 13:49.423
Preston Monk was murdered last night.

13:49.491 --> 13:52.126
I didn't do anything.

13:52.194 --> 13:54.194
You deny being there?

13:54.262 --> 13:57.197
No. I went there all
right, ready to do him harm,

13:57.265 --> 14:00.267
when I saw another man with him, a big man.

14:00.334 --> 14:04.003
- I couldn't take on both of them.
- What time was this?

14:04.071 --> 14:07.940
Between 6 and 7, I can't be right sure.

14:08.008 --> 14:10.142
Right, Mr. Sykes, come with me.

14:10.210 --> 14:13.512
- I didn't do anything.
- Then you have nothing to worry about, do you?

14:19.576 --> 14:23.228
- He had a moustache.
- This sort of a moustache?

14:23.229 --> 14:24.948
More of a moustache.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.414
More of a moustache.

14:27.482 --> 14:29.783
I can assure you, Mr. Eaton, I've
got my best men working on this.

14:29.850 --> 14:32.018
I appreciate your efforts,
Inspector Brackenreid.

14:32.086 --> 14:34.987
I don't want this morbid affair
to affect morale at the store.

14:35.055 --> 14:37.790
And you've got a reputation to protect.

14:37.857 --> 14:40.793
Eaton's is one of the biggest
department stores in the world,

14:40.860 --> 14:43.829
but that doesn't mean our competition
isn't nipping at our heels.

14:43.897 --> 14:47.233
We're investigating this
as discretely as possible.

14:47.301 --> 14:49.435
My father hopes to pass
on the store one day.

14:49.503 --> 14:52.237
He'd prefer I inherited an asset,

14:52.305 --> 14:54.606
not a liability. Good day.

14:54.674 --> 14:58.577
Mr. Eaton.

14:58.644 --> 15:01.580
What have you got, Murdoch? I've just
had my ear bent by Eaton the Younger,

15:01.647 --> 15:04.949
- so it better be good.
- Well, sir, we have the Identikit.

15:06.185 --> 15:07.456
Is that all he could come up with?

15:07.457 --> 15:09.154
That could be any one of a hundred men.

15:10.021 --> 15:12.923
Hardly worth the effort.

15:12.990 --> 15:15.759
Keep at it, George.

15:23.634 --> 15:26.436
- Are you quite ready?
- Yes, Eva.

15:26.503 --> 15:28.804
I am to be referred to as Miss Pearce.

15:28.872 --> 15:30.340
Sorry.

15:30.407 --> 15:33.243
Miss Pearce.

15:35.579 --> 15:38.480
Ladies, we can improve our sales

15:38.548 --> 15:42.150
by following a few simple tips.

15:42.218 --> 15:45.754
Remember to flatter your customers.

15:45.821 --> 15:48.523
They want to hear how
fetching they will look

15:48.591 --> 15:51.693
in their new tea gown.

15:51.761 --> 15:54.662
And touch the dress as you talk...

15:54.730 --> 15:58.165
the garment will seem more alluring.

16:00.969 --> 16:04.171
- Detective Murdoch.
- Good day, Miss Pearce. Ladies.

16:05.574 --> 16:09.377
- How can we help the Constabulary today?
- I wonder if any of you

16:09.444 --> 16:12.445
has seen this man before?

16:14.482 --> 16:16.783
Anyone?

16:20.621 --> 16:22.518
What is a stock boy doing,
presuming to be on the floor?

16:22.519 --> 16:24.354
Pearl, send him away.

16:24.659 --> 16:28.093
Customers are about to arrive.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.129
Come on, Mr. Barker. Let's go.

16:31.197 --> 16:33.265
How about you?

16:33.333 --> 16:35.367
I've never seen him.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.671
We'll talk about this later.

16:52.017 --> 16:54.619
- Darcy.
- Hello, Julia.

16:54.687 --> 16:58.488
Am I interrupting?

16:58.556 --> 17:01.458
I received these from my lawyer.

17:01.526 --> 17:05.494
It's all very... thorough.

17:05.563 --> 17:09.398
I'm sorry it's such a tawdry business,
Darcy. I know this isn't easy for you.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.535
Our outing last week...

17:11.602 --> 17:14.170
- I really enjoyed being with you again.
- Yes.

17:14.238 --> 17:16.505
I'm pleased that we can be friends.

17:16.573 --> 17:20.443
In the past I may not have expressed
the affection I have for you,

17:20.510 --> 17:22.811
but I... I really do feel it,

17:22.878 --> 17:25.079
and if you could give me another chance...

17:25.147 --> 17:27.148
Well... we've decided, Darcy.

17:30.953 --> 17:33.455
I'm not ready to let you go, Julia.

17:39.528 --> 17:43.130
That's how you really feel about me.

17:43.198 --> 17:44.833
I'm sorry.

17:48.837 --> 17:51.505
You walk arm in arm with him.

17:51.573 --> 17:54.941
You're seen kissing him in public.

17:57.679 --> 18:00.914
- What are you doing?
- If I can't have you for my wife, neither can he.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.922
Julia, is everything all right?

18:09.990 --> 18:12.191
I'm perfectly fine.

18:12.259 --> 18:16.028
I thoroughly enjoy being
stifled in this cocoon.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.063
What do you mean?

18:18.131 --> 18:21.933
Darcy ripped up the divorce papers.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.836
Oh. Why did he do that?

18:24.904 --> 18:26.838
I rejected his advances

18:26.906 --> 18:29.140
and wounded his male pride.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.011
I'm sure he'll come around in time.

18:33.078 --> 18:35.178
No, he won't.

18:35.246 --> 18:37.415
He's determined to punish me.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.553
What do we do?

18:42.621 --> 18:46.056
We live together.

18:46.124 --> 18:48.492
Openly.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.827
And suffer the scandal.

18:50.895 --> 18:53.362
No, we won't suffer.

18:53.431 --> 18:57.333
We'll shock everyone and
revel in the outrageousness!

18:59.369 --> 19:03.005
- Julia...
- What do you think, William?

19:03.073 --> 19:04.908
Can we really be that bold?

19:09.445 --> 19:12.815
I... I have to go.

19:15.618 --> 19:19.521
Sir, I collected the
pinch bars you requested.

19:19.589 --> 19:21.824
Very good.

19:21.891 --> 19:25.526
You may want to begin with this one, sir.

19:25.594 --> 19:27.929
It's from the Ladies' Wear stock room.

19:27.996 --> 19:31.499
Right. Can you fetch my
ultraviolet light, please?

19:36.071 --> 19:40.239
Perfect.

19:40.307 --> 19:42.041
Could you switch off the lights, please?

19:47.114 --> 19:50.183
- Blood.
- Even better

19:52.520 --> 19:56.355
A fingermark.

20:12.838 --> 20:16.340
- I hope this will wash off, Constable.
- It's just printing ink,

20:16.441 --> 20:19.677
- Miss Redmond.
- But how will printing ink help find the murderer?

20:19.712 --> 20:22.514
Well, Detective Murdoch, and
myself, have devised a way

20:22.581 --> 20:24.549
to raise fingermarks

20:24.617 --> 20:27.317
from surfaces or objects
connected to a crime scene.

20:27.385 --> 20:29.953
- You don't say.
- It's irrefutable evidence.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.422
A silent witness, if you will.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.124
Very interesting.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.627
Well, we're all done. Thank you.

20:41.232 --> 20:43.900
You're very knowledgeable, Constable.

20:43.967 --> 20:46.135
Well, I am the Detective's right-hand man.

20:46.202 --> 20:49.705
He's very lucky to have you.

20:57.781 --> 21:00.381
This idea of a store that sells
everything you need under one roof

21:00.449 --> 21:03.151
is quite clever, isn't it, sir?

21:03.218 --> 21:05.286
I mean, you could buy a
ham, a hammock and a hammer,

21:05.354 --> 21:07.622
all without getting wet.

21:07.690 --> 21:09.724
If it was raining, I suppose.

21:09.792 --> 21:12.293
Although if it were raining, you would
probably be disinclined to buy a hammock.

21:12.361 --> 21:15.495
You'd be better...

21:15.564 --> 21:17.565
Sir...

21:17.632 --> 21:20.868
- What is it, George?
- A match.

21:27.541 --> 21:31.744
The fingermark on the weapon

21:29.509 --> 21:31.744
is the stock boy,

21:31.812 --> 21:33.212
Jake Barker.

21:34.982 --> 21:37.416
Mr. Barker.

21:37.484 --> 21:40.552
Toronto Constabulary! Open up.

21:43.022 --> 21:45.090
All right, George. Have at it.

21:48.061 --> 21:50.963
We're too late.

21:59.599 --> 22:02.601
So it would appear Barker
shot himself, then, sir.

22:02.669 --> 22:05.570
Not so fast, George. Have a look around.

22:05.638 --> 22:08.906
Tell me what you see.

22:08.973 --> 22:11.609
Nothing unusual.

22:11.677 --> 22:13.811
There are two glasses on this table,

22:13.878 --> 22:16.514
which would suggest Mr.
Barker had a visitor.

22:16.581 --> 22:18.949
One of the glasses has his fingermarks,

22:19.017 --> 22:21.819
and the other has been wiped clean.

22:21.886 --> 22:25.889
Take a look at the stove.

22:27.391 --> 22:30.493
Ash. It's been used recently.

22:30.594 --> 22:33.030
And yet the last two nights were quite hot.

22:33.097 --> 22:35.365
Strange inconsistencies.

22:35.433 --> 22:38.202
Exactly.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.269
Bloody hell.

22:40.337 --> 22:42.771
Sir, it would appear he shot himself.

22:42.840 --> 22:45.107
I can see that, Crabtree.

22:45.175 --> 22:47.710
So Barker kills Monk and then offs himself.

22:47.777 --> 22:50.046
I'll go and tell Mr.
Eaton the case is closed.

22:50.113 --> 22:52.448
Inspector, I said

22:52.515 --> 22:55.150
'it would appear he shot himself'.

22:55.218 --> 22:58.153
- What are you talking about?
- Notice the two glasses on the table, sir.

22:58.221 --> 23:00.388
One covered in Barker's fingermarks.

23:00.456 --> 23:02.623
The other, none at all,

23:02.691 --> 23:04.592
which would suggest that
somebody else was here.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.562
Somebody who did not want
their identity revealed.

23:07.629 --> 23:11.365
- He still shot himself. He's holding the bloody gun.
- Actually, sir,

23:11.432 --> 23:14.201
I believe someone else shot
Barker and placed the gun

23:14.269 --> 23:16.403
in his hand. My thinking
as well, Detective.

23:16.471 --> 23:19.773
- In fact, it is my thinking...
- That's enough thinking from you, Crabtree. Don't push it.

23:19.841 --> 23:22.009
So what's the connection

23:22.077 --> 23:25.012
between Barker and Monk? Who's
got a grievance with both of them?

23:25.080 --> 23:27.613
Perhaps our mystery man who was with Monk

23:27.681 --> 23:29.815
also paid Mr. Barker a visit.

23:29.884 --> 23:33.086
Unfortunately, Mr. Sykes
doesn't seem to remember him.

23:33.153 --> 23:33.841
Right.

23:33.842 --> 23:37.425
Well, let's go and see if we can't
awaken Mr. Sykes' senses, shall we?

23:40.861 --> 23:43.996
It's a bit early for a drink. 

23:44.063 --> 23:48.800
How can I help Toronto's fine Constabulary?

23:48.868 --> 23:51.836
- Is this the man you saw with Monk?
- No.

23:51.905 --> 23:55.140
He was older than that. And what else?

23:55.208 --> 23:57.276
I described him as best I could.

23:57.343 --> 24:00.512
- Describe him better.
- I told you all I know.

24:00.579 --> 24:03.047
He was in the office spouting off,

24:03.115 --> 24:05.650
pointing at Monk with his big fat cigar.

24:05.718 --> 24:08.586
Hey!

24:08.654 --> 24:10.588
Get yourself a job

24:10.656 --> 24:12.924
and stop having the missus do your duty.

24:19.263 --> 24:21.765
It's not a very good likeness,

24:21.833 --> 24:23.901
but it could be a chap who shops here.

24:23.968 --> 24:27.471
- What's his name?
- Oh, I don't know. He just buys cigars from me.

24:27.539 --> 24:29.540
Cuban tobacco...

24:29.607 --> 24:32.041
from the Vuelta Abajo region to be exact.

24:32.108 --> 24:35.044
It's an expensive cigar
but worth every penny.

24:35.111 --> 24:38.013
- I bring them in specially.
- I don't suppose you know where he lives.

24:38.081 --> 24:40.249
- No.
- If he comes by again, would you let us know?

24:40.317 --> 24:42.652
Of course.

25:16.084 --> 25:18.686
I didn't know Jake Barker very well.

25:18.753 --> 25:20.553
When was this photograph taken?

25:20.621 --> 25:23.155
Last year at the Cabbagetown street fair.

25:23.223 --> 25:25.224
We were at the photograph
booth at the same time.

25:25.292 --> 25:27.259
At the exact same time?

25:27.327 --> 25:29.261
That's quite a coincidence.

25:29.329 --> 25:31.197
What do you mean?

25:31.264 --> 25:34.133
Miss Redmond, I believe you
knew Jake Barker quite well.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.301
I saw the way you spoke
to him in the store.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.470
I was helping him keep his job.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.840
Miss Redmond, if you are
withholding information,

25:41.908 --> 25:44.576
that's obstruction of
a murder investigation.

25:44.644 --> 25:47.779
Now, was he your beau?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.815
He wasn't interested in me.

25:49.883 --> 25:52.316
There are two girls in the photograph.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.987
Yes, I knew Jake Barker.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.322
Why did you not tell me?

25:58.390 --> 26:01.125
I didn't think it relevant
to your investigation.

26:01.192 --> 26:03.260
It was quite pertinent, Miss Pearce.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.630
Jake Barker murdered Preston Monk.

26:05.697 --> 26:09.065
No... that can't be.

26:09.133 --> 26:11.300
The evidence is conclusive.

26:13.303 --> 26:15.438
I didn't think he'd go that far.

26:15.506 --> 26:17.841
Do you know why he killed Monk?

26:17.909 --> 26:20.476
It was my fault.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.546
What do you mean?

26:22.613 --> 26:24.580
Jake and I were together for a brief time

26:24.648 --> 26:27.650
before I joined the Eaton company.

26:27.717 --> 26:29.451
But it wasn't easy, Detective Murdoch.

26:29.519 --> 26:31.820
If another man so much as glanced at me,

26:31.888 --> 26:33.989
Jake would fly into a fit of jealousy.

26:34.057 --> 26:38.226
He saw rivals for my attention
wherever we went. In the end,

26:38.294 --> 26:41.228
I had no choice but to run away from him.

26:42.364 --> 26:44.331
Miss Pearce,

26:44.399 --> 26:46.734
what does this have to
do with Preston Monk?

26:46.802 --> 26:49.170
Mr. Monk changed my life.

26:49.237 --> 26:52.206
He opened up new worlds
I didn't think possible.

26:52.274 --> 26:55.376
Do you know what that feels like
to a girl like me, Detective?

26:55.444 --> 26:59.112
A chance to make a new
start? A chance to be someone?

26:59.180 --> 27:01.949
And then Jake found me.

27:02.016 --> 27:04.517
- When was this?
- Two months ago.

27:04.586 --> 27:07.955
He saw how much time and attention

27:08.067 --> 27:11.402
Mr. Monk was spending on me.
It drove him mad with jealousy.

27:11.470 --> 27:14.438
He hounded me, begging
me to come back to him.

27:14.506 --> 27:16.607
I pleaded with him to let me go,

27:16.675 --> 27:18.809
but he was relentless.

27:18.877 --> 27:21.612
Did you know Jake was going to kill Monk?

27:21.680 --> 27:23.914
I never thought him a violent man.

27:23.982 --> 27:27.584
I didn't realize how far he'd go.

27:27.652 --> 27:30.219
Now two men are dead because of me.

27:32.990 --> 27:35.625
Miss Pearce, you now hold

27:35.693 --> 27:38.628
Mr. Monk's position in the Ladies
Wear Department, do you not?

27:38.696 --> 27:41.597
I am the interim manager.

27:41.666 --> 27:45.433
So it would seem that you benefited
greatly from Mr. Monk's demise.

27:45.501 --> 27:48.637
I suppose I did.

27:48.705 --> 27:51.140
I hadn't thought of it that way.

27:51.207 --> 27:53.909
That's all I have for
the moment, Miss Pearce.

27:57.814 --> 28:00.815
Detective, if I were to kill,

28:00.883 --> 28:03.651
it wouldn't be for a job at Eaton's.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.162
I just don't see her as a murderer.

28:15.229 --> 28:17.564
I'm not sure she is, sir. 

28:18.733 --> 28:20.366
You have an opinion, Doctor?

28:20.434 --> 28:22.535
Gentlemen, you are proof positive.

28:22.603 --> 28:25.337
Miss Pearce is a classic manipulator.

28:25.405 --> 28:28.174
A somewhat hasty conclusion.

28:28.241 --> 28:30.910
She controlled the entire interview.

28:30.977 --> 28:33.979
She uses provocative, distracting gestures.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.882
Her smile. The smoothing of her dress.

28:38.051 --> 28:40.852
Her choked tears.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.956
Would you like a more detailed analysis?

28:46.926 --> 28:49.260
Yes, I would.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.913
Miss Pearce was at her most vulnerable

28:50.914 --> 28:53.062
when you produced the
photograph of her with Barker.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.832
But she quickly used this to her advantage.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.701
From the moment she said
the murder was her fault,

28:57.769 --> 28:59.569
she was driving the interview.

28:59.637 --> 29:02.272
But I was asking the questions.

29:02.340 --> 29:05.308
Which she used to cleverly
portray herself as the victim,

29:05.376 --> 29:07.711
changing the rhythm of the interview,

29:07.779 --> 29:09.813
holding you in her gaze.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.781
That's how she disarmed you.

29:11.849 --> 29:14.383
I was hardly disarmed.

29:14.451 --> 29:16.418
Dr. Ogden has got a point, Murdoch.

29:16.486 --> 29:18.654
I felt it myself when I met Miss Pearce.

29:18.722 --> 29:20.723
She looked at me as she said...

29:20.791 --> 29:22.625
Inspector.

29:22.692 --> 29:26.262
Like I was someone she wanted to remember.

29:26.329 --> 29:29.131
As though you were special to her.

29:31.634 --> 29:34.369
Oh, it would appear you
aren't the only one, sir.

29:34.436 --> 29:35.904
John Craig Eaton.

29:35.972 --> 29:39.007
Heir to the Eaton family fortune.

29:49.179 --> 29:51.747
I understand you've
been courting Mr. Eaton.

29:51.814 --> 29:54.884
For now. He finds me quite charming.

29:54.951 --> 29:58.387
That's certainly a step up
from stock boy, Miss Pearce.

29:58.454 --> 30:00.588
I don't need a job at Eaton's.

30:00.655 --> 30:02.757
I have other plans.

30:06.396 --> 30:10.564
Plans that could involve you, Detective.

30:31.286 --> 30:33.219
Did you desire her?

30:33.287 --> 30:35.821
Yes, I did.

30:35.889 --> 30:38.857
What do you think?

30:38.926 --> 30:40.960
Well...

30:41.028 --> 30:42.945
you may never feel the same
way about shopping again.

30:43.665 --> 30:46.399
Julia, be serious.

30:46.466 --> 30:49.434
Your dream confirms my instincts.

30:49.501 --> 30:52.670
Miss Pearce uses her
erotic power to seduce men.

30:54.706 --> 30:58.243
- I wasn't seduced.
- Consciously, you were impervious.

30:58.311 --> 31:01.079
But Miss Pearce invaded your subconscious

31:01.147 --> 31:03.114
and emerged in your dreams.

31:03.182 --> 31:05.882
What do you mean, she's
a siren of some sort?

31:05.951 --> 31:08.118
No.

31:08.186 --> 31:10.587
But Dr. Freud suggests we are all ruled

31:10.655 --> 31:13.590
by our sexual urges,
consciously or unconsciously.

31:15.994 --> 31:18.662
What does this have to do

31:18.729 --> 31:21.998
with the deaths of Barker and Monk?

31:22.066 --> 31:24.667
Well, given her power over you,

31:24.734 --> 31:28.037
imagine her hold on a
man already in her thrall.

31:28.105 --> 31:32.208
Are you saying she enticed
Barker into killing Monk?

31:32.276 --> 31:34.577
Quite possibly.

31:34.644 --> 31:38.513
She told me that she
wouldn't kill for Monk's job.

31:38.581 --> 31:40.949
So why would Eva Pearce

31:41.017 --> 31:43.485
want Preston Monk dead?

31:43.552 --> 31:46.554
Mr. Bennett, we got your message.

31:46.622 --> 31:49.958
Oh, you missed your man. He picked
up his cigars not 5 minutes ago.

31:50.026 --> 31:53.427
- Did you see which way he went?
- Towards the Queen's Hotel.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.163
Thank you.

32:06.774 --> 32:09.175
Sir. Toronto Constabulary.

32:09.243 --> 32:12.412
What in God's name are you doing?

32:12.480 --> 32:15.815
- The Detective has a couple of questions for you, sir.
- You're making a mistake.

32:15.883 --> 32:19.052
I'm a private investigator. I'm
working on a matter of some delicacy.

32:21.855 --> 32:24.990
Thank you for calling attention to me.

32:25.058 --> 32:27.559
What is your name?

32:27.627 --> 32:29.828
Gerald

32:29.896 --> 32:33.032
Biskind. Mr. Biskind,

32:33.099 --> 32:35.498
did you have a meeting with
a Preston Monk on Monday last?

32:35.499 --> 32:36.499
Yes, I did.

32:37.037 --> 32:40.204
He had me looking into one of the
shop girls. She had quite the past...

32:40.272 --> 32:42.840
soliciting, procuring of other young women.

32:42.908 --> 32:46.110
I gave Monk a file full
of unsavoury details.

32:46.178 --> 32:48.679
Which girl was it?

32:48.747 --> 32:50.848
Eva Pearce.

32:50.916 --> 32:53.117
Quite the looker, isn't she?

32:54.170 --> 32:57.004
Eva knew that Monk made it his business
to check the backgrounds of the shop girls.

32:57.072 --> 32:59.574
And if Monk knew about her past,
Eva Pearce had to silence him.

32:59.642 --> 33:03.211
Right. He would ruin her chances
of marrying into the Eaton family.

33:03.279 --> 33:06.481
- She had the motive.
- And a patsy to do it for her.

33:06.549 --> 33:09.651
So when she saw Biskind arrive
that evening with a file in hand,

33:09.719 --> 33:12.186
she put two and two together.
He was working for Monk.

33:12.254 --> 33:14.455
But then, sir, we didn't find
anything in Monk's office.

33:14.522 --> 33:16.523
Barker burned the file.

33:16.591 --> 33:18.859
- The ashes in the fireplace.
- Exactly.

33:18.926 --> 33:22.229
So Murdoch, how are you going
to prove she was involved?

33:22.297 --> 33:25.633
Dr. Grace, have you toxicology
results on Jake Barker's post mortem?

33:25.700 --> 33:28.568
- I did discover something.
- Let me guess.

33:28.636 --> 33:31.103
- Large amounts of a sedative.
- Exactly, Detective.

33:31.171 --> 33:34.807
Laudanum to be precise. He was so
sedated at the time of his death,

33:34.875 --> 33:37.644
he couldn't have held a gun,
let alone pulled the trigger.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.979
He was definitely murdered.

34:02.401 --> 34:04.635
We meet again, Detective.

34:04.703 --> 34:08.773
Miss Pearce.

34:08.840 --> 34:12.176
I now believe that you know
far more about this matter

34:12.243 --> 34:14.344
- than you've been saying.
- I do?

34:14.413 --> 34:16.179
Enlighten me.

34:18.116 --> 34:20.050
Let's go back to the night

34:20.118 --> 34:22.319
that Preston Monk was murdered.

34:22.386 --> 34:25.956
As you were leaving
for home, you saw a man,

34:26.024 --> 34:28.192
Gerald Biskind,

34:28.259 --> 34:30.460
a private investigator,
arrive at the store.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.295
I don't know any Gerald Biskind.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.965
Oh, that's odd. Because he remembered you.

34:36.033 --> 34:38.134
Men have a habit of noticing me.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.335
You were no doubt worried

34:40.402 --> 34:42.972
that Mr. Monk was going to
find out about your past.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.242
- My past?
- Come now, Miss Pearce,

34:46.310 --> 34:48.311
we both know what you were.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.978
And you didn't want
anyone finding that out,

34:51.047 --> 34:53.348
certainly not Mr. Eaton.

34:53.415 --> 34:56.251
That's quite an insinuation, Detective.

34:56.319 --> 34:58.253
So you devised a plan.

34:58.321 --> 35:00.388
You turned to Jake Barker,

35:00.456 --> 35:03.825
your former beau.

35:03.893 --> 35:07.361
Jake was besotted.

35:07.428 --> 35:09.796
He would do anything to earn your...

35:09.865 --> 35:11.998
favours.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.368
You told him that Monk
was out to destroy you

35:14.435 --> 35:16.370
and had to be stopped.

35:16.437 --> 35:19.172
I don't know what to do. I need help.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.208
- Oh, it's going to be okay.
- Will you help me?

35:22.276 --> 35:24.478
Yes.

35:27.248 --> 35:30.416
Jake was in your thrall...

35:30.484 --> 35:33.218
until the Constabulary proved that Monk

35:33.286 --> 35:36.422
had indeed been murdered. Jake got nervous.

35:36.490 --> 35:39.458
He came looking for you.

35:39.526 --> 35:41.427
That's when you realized...

35:41.495 --> 35:45.129
that he was becoming a liability.
And you had to kill him.

35:45.197 --> 35:48.600
I did no such thing.

35:48.667 --> 35:51.035
The two of you met at Barker's room.

35:51.103 --> 35:52.937
You had drinks.

35:53.005 --> 35:54.972
Like old times.

36:01.546 --> 36:04.581
You poured a powerful
sedative in his drink.

36:10.388 --> 36:12.589
He didn't feel a thing, did he?

36:14.659 --> 36:18.528
You put the gun to his head
and pulled the trigger...

36:18.595 --> 36:22.131
Then wiped everything
that you had touched clean.

36:22.198 --> 36:24.667
As if you'd never been there.

36:24.735 --> 36:28.404
You knew about fingermark evidence

36:28.472 --> 36:31.940
because you had overheard Constable
Crabtree's helpful information.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.911
You killed Jake Barker, Miss Pearce.

36:35.978 --> 36:39.414
You have no evidence. Not one piece.

36:39.482 --> 36:43.151
I fully intend to prove your guilt.

36:43.218 --> 36:46.321
Take your time, Detective.

36:47.489 --> 36:49.289
Constable.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.694
Miss Pearce will wait for me in the cells.

36:53.762 --> 36:55.729
You have no right.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.765
In the cells.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.267
That's where we put your kind.

37:52.650 --> 37:55.585
I thought you couldn't get a fingermark

37:55.653 --> 37:58.321
- from such a small casing.
- I didn't get a whole fingermark, sir,

37:58.389 --> 38:00.624
just part of the outer rim.

38:00.691 --> 38:03.226
That's not a part,
that's a piece of a part.

38:03.293 --> 38:06.930
Even if I can match just a part of one...

38:06.998 --> 38:09.732
Then we've got her.

38:13.504 --> 38:16.939
I don't say this enough, Murdoch,
but you do have some brilliant ideas.

38:18.909 --> 38:23.012
Thank you, sir. Except
that this isn't a match.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.880
- It's not her.
- Bloody hell.

38:25.948 --> 38:29.251
So if it wasn't Eva who shot
Barker, who the hell did?

38:51.940 --> 38:55.609
He was your beau, Miss Redmond.

38:55.677 --> 38:57.944
She stole him from you.

38:58.011 --> 39:01.181
Eva has a way of getting
everything she wants.

39:03.117 --> 39:05.751
But you figured it out.

39:05.819 --> 39:07.853
You realized that Eva

39:07.921 --> 39:10.656
persuaded Jake to kill Monk.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.092
She seduced him.

39:13.159 --> 39:15.327
Promising they'd be together again.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.762
He was a fool to believe her.

39:17.830 --> 39:20.665
She had her sights set
higher than a stock boy.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.335
I gave him a chance.

39:23.403 --> 39:26.105
I told him I wouldn't tell a soul
what he'd done if he came back to me.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.309
He just laughed at me.

39:31.376 --> 39:33.777
And that's when you decided to kill him

39:33.845 --> 39:36.581
and to frame Eva for the murder.

39:36.648 --> 39:39.783
It was just desserts for
what they did to Mr. Monk.

39:39.851 --> 39:42.453
And to you, Miss Redmond.

39:59.170 --> 40:01.203
You are free to go, Miss Pearce.

40:03.306 --> 40:05.441
I told the Detective everything Jake said.

40:05.509 --> 40:07.743
How you put him up to killing Mr. Monk.

40:07.810 --> 40:09.945
Words from a dead man
carry very little weight.

40:10.013 --> 40:12.181
Am I right, Detective?

40:12.249 --> 40:14.316
You won't get away with it, Eva.

40:14.384 --> 40:17.619
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:31.700 --> 40:35.369
I'm very happy to see the
end of this sordid affair.

40:35.436 --> 40:37.404
The Eaton family is very grateful

40:37.472 --> 40:40.140
for your discretion, Inspector.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.176
A word of advice, son.

40:42.243 --> 40:45.679
Don't dip your pen in the company ink.

41:02.362 --> 41:04.362
So she gets to walk away, Murdoch?

41:04.430 --> 41:06.864
Even though she was the cause of all this?

41:06.932 --> 41:11.069
- I'm afraid so.
- You've got to give it to her,

41:11.136 --> 41:13.805
she's a survivor.

41:19.545 --> 41:23.615
Eva Pearce has enormous power.
Even you were attracted to her.

41:23.682 --> 41:26.917
It was a fleeting moment, Julia.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.121
A man throws away his life for
a woman. Even kills for her.

41:30.189 --> 41:32.089
He wants her that much.

41:32.158 --> 41:34.458
Apparently.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.627
What about me, William...

41:36.694 --> 41:40.897
have I asked too much of you
with my immodest proposal?

41:40.965 --> 41:44.067
You are so lovely to me, Julia,

41:44.135 --> 41:46.470
but we can only truly be together

41:46.538 --> 41:48.772
if we are married.

41:48.839 --> 41:52.208
I won't compromise you.

41:54.044 --> 41:55.944
Probably not the answer you wanted to hear.

41:56.012 --> 41:59.314
But you have principles.

41:59.382 --> 42:02.150
Yes, I do.

42:02.218 --> 42:05.820
And if you went against them, you
wouldn't be the man I want to marry.

42:05.888 --> 42:09.090
Really?

42:09.158 --> 42:11.092
Don't be silly.

42:11.160 --> 42:14.061
If anything, this makes me love you more.

42:20.635 --> 42:23.970
So what happens now?

42:24.038 --> 42:25.972
We wait.

42:26.040 --> 42:29.342
In time Darcy will give in.

42:31.278 --> 42:34.647
Perhaps.

42:34.715 --> 42:37.217
In the meantime,

42:37.284 --> 42:39.319
let's enjoy this beautiful day.

42:39.386 --> 42:42.388
Yes.

42:42.456 --> 42:44.723
So, Detective,

42:44.790 --> 42:48.627
have any other heavenly creatures
entered your dreams of late?

42:48.695 --> 42:52.297
Oh, no, no. Not at all. Just you.

42:55.568 --> 42:58.237
Excuse me, Miss.

42:58.304 --> 43:01.606
- You dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

43:01.673 --> 43:05.710
- Is everything all right?
- Yes... no.

43:07.679 --> 43:09.913
My sweetheart left me.

43:09.981 --> 43:11.949
I would say that man's a fool.
