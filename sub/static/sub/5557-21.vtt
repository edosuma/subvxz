Every season it seems we never
run out of this incredible

08:52.905 --> 08:57.776
Talent pool and our comments
last night, i think as coaches

08:57.910 --> 09:02.514
Sometimes if we look on twitter
or read social medias, it's like

09:02.648 --> 09:06.785
Why did you pick so and so?
This is why.

09:06.919 --> 09:11.656
We as coaches our job is to
figure out what artist we can

09:11.791 --> 09:14.859
Watch on this stage when we get
to the lives that are going to

09:14.994 --> 09:18.897

this season and the crop of

09:36.148 --> 09:38.883
Artists that we have so special
to you?

09:39.018 --> 09:41.453
>> it's hard to answer that
question.

09:41.587 --> 09:45.090
Every season you feel like the
people are getting progressively

09:45.224 --> 09:48.059
Better that come here.
But i think this particular

09:48.194 --> 09:51.630
Season everybody is taking the
notes like, the guys are taking

09:51.764 --> 09:55.233
The notes and they're coming
back and you're seeing the

09:55.368 --> 09:59.404
Improvement and they get better
and better and better.

09:59.538 --> 10:02.407

moments.

I feel like madi had a super
magical moment.

We have a quick question here to

10:39.445 --> 10:43.448
Jordan, last night you sang "who
you are" how important was it to

10:43.582 --> 10:47.686
Deliver the message of that song
to america last night?

10:47.820 --> 10:51.456
>> i'm really glad i got to sing
that song.

10:51.590 --> 10:55.026
It embodies who i am and such a
big part of what i believe.

10:55.161 --> 11:00.398
I think the message of it was so
important especially for us as

11:00.533 --> 11:04.135
Contestants and this process.
You are thrust out in front of

11:04.270 --> 11:07.105
America and you can get caught
up in the busyness and the

11:07.239 --> 11:11.743
Attention.
I think it was an important

11:11.877 --> 11:17.415
Reminder it is important to stay
true to who you are in all

11:17.550 --> 11:22.721
Situations.

We will always be bound together

18:51.637 --> 18:59.143
Reason we are here, music is the
thing that brought us here.

18:59.278 --> 19:01.646
¶ we all need someone to lean
on ¶

19:01.780 --> 19:04.849
>> everyone was a stranger at

19:04.983 --> 19:09.620
People around me would become
the people i leaned on.

19:09.755 --> 19:13.324

all of our artist and of course,

19:13.458 --> 19:17.795

Evan, pharrell said you really
introduced yourself to america

19:28.106 --> 19:31.809
Last night.
While here on our show what have

19:31.944 --> 19:33.578
You learned about yourself as an
artist?

19:33.712 --> 19:37.515
>> i learned you have to play to
your strengths and know what you

19:37.649 --> 19:43.287
Give best.
And pharrell has taught me what

19:43.422 --> 19:48.859
I do best is using music to
connect with people and speak to

19:48.994 --> 19:53.164
People on a grand scale and
us

19:53.298 --> 19:57.134
Using music to have an impact.
That is something powerful that

19:57.269 --> 19:59.403
Everybody can feel.

wait so long ¶

¶ and wouldn't it be nice
to live together

Changed you?
>> i don't see myself going back

To the job that i was working.
I see myself as a performer now

26:24.155 --> 26:27.958
And "the voice" has given me an
opportunity to live out a

26:28.093 --> 26:31.629
Passion and dream of mine.
I can't see myself doing

26:31.763 --> 26:35.432
Anything else because nothing
else has made me this happy.

Together, blake do you think
that is enough?

32:15.073 --> 32:18.742
>> man, you know, i'm a fan of
yours and i'll tell you the same

32:18.876 --> 32:23.947
Thing that i told the two last
week, you know, don't -- i hope

32:24.082 --> 32:29.186
Just the fact that you're in
this twitter save situation now

32:29.320 --> 32:34.691
Doesn't wear you out or upset
you.

32:34.826 --> 32:38.895
That is as good a singing as
anybody in this competition.

32:39.030 --> 32:42.966
Week to week, i swear i've seen
it so many times.

32:43.101 --> 32:46.603
I think it just comes down to a
week to week situation.

32:46.738 --> 32:53.377
So you did a great job there.
Let's see what happens.

32:53.511 --> 32:57.514
>> carson: Coach pharrell?
>> you know, at the end of the

32:57.648 --> 33:02.686
Day, evan, the coolest part
about what we get to do is when

33:02.820 --> 33:06.023
We get to work with people like
you with all that talent and

33:06.157 --> 33:10.761
Remind you that the thing you
love to do is what saved you in

33:10.895 --> 33:14.531
This life and that is your music
and your connection to god.

33:14.665 --> 33:20.370
And so you should just
understand that, even though you

33:20.505 --> 33:23.106
Are at the bottom and in a
twitter save moment, the most

33:23.241 --> 33:28.779
Important thing is your growth
and you realize you are only

33:28.913 --> 33:32.816
Running one race, your own.
Me, personally i'm super proud

33:32.950 --> 33:38.355
Of where you are and leading
yourself right now.

33:38.489 --> 33:42.159

36:22.553 --> 36:25.922
For obvious reasons.
Thank you for that.

36:26.057 --> 36:29.092
You know, i've never heard a
female vocalist on that song.

>> all my adolescence in one
song.

36:51.949 --> 36:54.251
>> carson: Gwen, korin has been
here before, the question really

36:54.385 --> 36:59.222
Is why should america save her
again?

36:59.357 --> 37:00.991
>> korin, i'm just so proud of
you.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.927
I think they should save her
again.

37:04.061 --> 37:10.900
That would be so awesome, right?
How amazing is that?

37:11.035 --> 37:14.838
Honestly, honestly, i feel like
the reason why is because she's

37:14.972 --> 37:20.076
Had so much growth.
She is so talented and such an

37:20.211 --> 37:22.612
Amazing singer and just her
personal growth has been

37:22.747 --> 37:26.583
Incredible to watch.

This is what i love to do and
the stage i want to be on for

38:53.537 --> 38:55.372
The rest of my life.
There is nothing i wanted to do

38:55.506 --> 38:59.943
More than this.
You helped me realize that and

39:00.077 --> 39:04.280
Find ways to do it in new ways
