WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.019 --> 00:19.987
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
Knicks inbound.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.988
Porzingis drives. And one!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.923
-Tie game! And the Knicks...
-Boom!

00:22.956 --> 00:24.592
Yeah, baby!
That's how we do!

00:24.625 --> 00:26.760
ANNOUNCER:
...on the clock and a chance...

00:26.794 --> 00:28.196
Porzingis for life, son.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.065
I swear to God
I'd take a bullet for that dude.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.333
All right, fellas, time's up.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.834
Why don't you run upstairs
and fight over

00:33.867 --> 00:35.569
-the last dollop of pomade.
-No, no, no, no, no.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.405
This is more important
than anything you've ever done

00:37.438 --> 00:38.906
-in your entire life.
-Yeah, please, just, like,

00:38.939 --> 00:40.708
one more minute? We've got a lot
riding on the line.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.177
Oh, yeah?
What's the action? I want in.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.545
Double or nothing
my man Porzin-god

00:44.578 --> 00:46.080
-just finishes it right now.
-No way.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.515
It's going to OT, dude.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.250
-How much time's left?
-Four seconds.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.784
Ah, nah, you're both wrong.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.786
Cavs put it away right here.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.122
-Doubt.
-You're on.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.523
ANNOUNCER:
Porzingis shoots. Off the rim.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.890
Rebound by Love.
He throws it downcourt

00:56.924 --> 00:58.058
to a wide-open J.R. Smith.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.693
And Smith jams it home!
Cavs win!

00:59.727 --> 01:01.729
Damn it, Porzingis!
Go back to Latvia,

01:01.762 --> 01:03.264
you Latvian freak!

01:03.297 --> 01:06.200
-Told ya. -That was amazing.
How-how'd you do that?

01:06.234 --> 01:07.701
Common sense.
You got Porzingis on the line,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.370
so there goes
your best rebounder.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.105
You know the Knicks
are gonna double up LeBron,

01:11.139 --> 01:12.640
so that leaves somebody
wide-open.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.375
So, how'd you know he'd miss it
in the first place?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.144
Uh, 'cause he's white,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.212
and he's on the Knicks,
and they suck.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.381
Anyway, pay up.
What'd I win?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.716
You don't have
to sniff Dylan's dog's butt.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.153
What? You guys are betting
butt sniffs?

01:25.186 --> 01:27.621
You should see Humphrey.
He's covered in tumors.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.891
I don't care if he's all tumor.
There's no juice in that bet.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.560
Juice? What's juice?

01:32.593 --> 01:35.163
The juice!
Come on, guys.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.630
The-the juice is what
you're supposed

01:36.664 --> 01:39.500
to feel when you gamble,
you know?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.402
It's this amazing combination
of excitement and terror

01:41.435 --> 01:44.071
when you've put everything
on the line, and you have zero

01:44.104 --> 01:46.607
-control over what happens.
-That sounds intense.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.642
-How do we get the juice?
-Well, you're not gonna find it

01:48.676 --> 01:50.744
in some cancerous dog's
festering butt,

01:50.778 --> 01:52.613
I'll tell you that much.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.421
Hey, have you guys
seen my box...?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.856
Whoa. Who's that?

02:04.124 --> 02:07.195
Oh, hi. I'm Alexis.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.664
She's my girlfriend.
Who are you?

02:16.069 --> 02:18.772
Ah. So, you're lez now?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.774
Oh, my God, Mickey.
That is wildly offensive.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.943
What are you talking about?
It-it's just short for lesbian.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.213
I know what it's short for,
okay? I'm not a lesbian.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.947
Of course.
How stupid of me.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.382
Uh, what are you?

02:28.416 --> 02:30.218
I'm not anything.
Just stop trying to label me,

02:30.251 --> 02:31.785
you ancient bag of sand.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.422
-Come on, Alexis. -Oh,
it was nice meeting you guys.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.360
Okay.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.862
Here we go, Colonel.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.999
It's a beautiful day
to have lunch outside.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.969
Okay.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.240
Let's see. Okay.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.642
Bon appÃ©tit.
(laughs)

02:54.675 --> 02:57.878
Now for the old switcheroo,
right? (laughs)

02:57.911 --> 03:01.081
Okay. Oh, big stuff.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.083
Aah! Whoa!

03:03.116 --> 03:04.385
Damn you, old man!

03:04.418 --> 03:06.420
It got in my mouth! Whoa!

03:06.454 --> 03:08.088
(spits)
Aah!

03:08.121 --> 03:10.758
(panting)

03:10.791 --> 03:12.393
God.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.161
Greatest generation, my ass.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.163
The man contributes nothing.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.999
Oh. Uh...

03:19.032 --> 03:21.335
Uh...

03:21.369 --> 03:24.672
Colonel, how-how did you
get in here?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.440
Um... Wait.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.243
Hey, hey, Sabrina,
did-did you move The Colonel?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.878
Ew. No.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.585
Ooh.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.852
Come on,
who cares about practice?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.421
You're already the best player
on the team.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.456
Coach is gonna kill me
if I'm late to another workout.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.692
So what? Tell him
that I'll give you a workout.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.360
I promise mine will be more fun.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.397
I wish.
I'll see you tonight.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.369
-JIMMY: Not cool, Sabrina.
-(door closes)

03:55.403 --> 03:56.870
Not cool at all.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.139
What the hell? How long
have you been perched up there

03:59.172 --> 04:00.474
like some perverted gargoyle?

04:00.508 --> 04:03.043
(laughs) Sabrina,
you're like my daughter.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.746
I could watch you have sex,
and I wouldn't feel a thing.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.247
Is that how you envision
a normal

04:07.281 --> 04:08.582
-father-daughter relationship?
-No.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.618
That's not how I envision
a normal fa...

04:10.651 --> 04:13.621
Listen, as a former
athlete myself, I can assure you

04:13.654 --> 04:16.890
that missing a practice is not
in Alexis's best interest.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.627
-She any good?
-She's Alexis Dara.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.330
Captain of the
Junior National Soccer Team.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.432
The Times did a whole write-up
on her

04:24.465 --> 04:27.335
-in the sports section
last weekend. -There it is.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.069
-What?
-You're in it for the celebrity.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.504
-You don't know what you're
talking about. -Yeah? Well,

04:30.538 --> 04:32.840
what I do know is that
you have nothing to offer her,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.409
-and she has everything to lose.
-Whatever, dude, all right?

04:35.443 --> 04:38.979
Just, as a rule, don't watch me.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.185
Hey. There you are.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.588
-What are you doing? -Oh,
nothing. It just occurred to me

04:47.621 --> 04:50.157
a lot of these old houses
have, like, um, hidden safes

04:50.190 --> 04:53.761
and secret passages and stuff,
so I was just, you know...

04:53.794 --> 04:55.095
That's idiotic.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.865
Don't you have a dog butt
to sniff or something?

04:57.898 --> 05:00.334
We need you to teach us
how to gamble, the real stuff.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.603
-We want the juice.
-(chuckles)

05:02.636 --> 05:05.773
No, you don't. You might think
you do, but you don't.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.108
-Okay, come on. Why not?
-Look, Chip,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.611
I have done a lot
of low-down things in my life,

05:10.644 --> 05:12.713
but I'm gonna go ahead and draw
the line at teaching children

05:12.746 --> 05:15.449
-how to gamble. -We'll cut you
in on the winnings.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.117
As your gambling teacher,
I'm gonna need you

05:17.150 --> 05:18.386
to do everything I say.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.957
-This website seems
kind of janky. -Yeah.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.459
-What language is this in?
-(mumbles): I don't know.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.794
Russian or something.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.295
Got to go overseas
with this kind of stuff,

05:28.328 --> 05:29.663
so they don't tax you
up the ass.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.999
-All right, who's feeling lucky?
-Right here.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.301
I bet Tom Brady hucks up
a 60-yard touchdown

05:34.334 --> 05:36.470
first play of the game.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.805
That's not a bet.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.973
That's the wishful thinking
of a stupid boy.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.342
First rule of gambling: you bet
with your head, not your heart.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.844
And my head likes the Bills.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.345
(scoffs)
You think the frickin' Bills

05:45.379 --> 05:46.714
are gonna beat
Tom frickin' Brady?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.582
I ought to slap you in the face.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.418
They don't have to beat them.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.852
They just have to lose
by less than 17.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.987
-That's the spread.
-But the Bills suck.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.890
Yeah, yeah, I know that.
You know who else knows it?

05:56.924 --> 05:59.393
Your boy Tom Brady,
so he's probably spending

05:59.427 --> 06:01.094
his bye week curled up
by the fire

06:01.128 --> 06:02.430
in his little slipper booties,

06:02.463 --> 06:03.831
eating way too many carbs,
but the Bills--

06:03.864 --> 06:05.399
they're gonna come correct.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.401
Kind of sounds like she knows
what she's talking about.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.702
Yeah, I do know
what I'm talking about.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.270
-Somebody give me a credit card.
-No way.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.672
I'm not betting
against the GOAT.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.407
-Coward. Dylan?
-Why can't we use yours?

06:13.441 --> 06:15.843
-'Cause I don't have one. -Okay,
well, I only have my dad's.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.511
Okay, I'm sorry.
Did I misunderstand,

06:17.545 --> 06:19.780
or did you want the juice?
Juice or no juice?

06:19.813 --> 06:22.049
-Okay. All right.
Okay, fine. -Great.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.518
But you know what?
I'm typing it in.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.353
Right. You type it in.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.788
If I wanted your dad's money,

06:27.821 --> 06:29.523
there are other ways
of getting it.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.059
(Mickey clears throat)

06:34.161 --> 06:36.196
Okay, how much should I bet?

06:36.229 --> 06:39.433
I don't know. You feeling bold?
Throw a hunny on it.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.535
-You're positive?
-No, I'm not positive.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.203
That's what gambling is.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.105
Just frickin' do it! Okay,
I'm thirsty. I want the juice.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.140
-(Mickey clears throat)
-Okay, okay, okay, fine.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.710
It's... it's in.
Now what?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.746
All right.
Now we leave it up to the gods.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.983
I feel kind of nervous,
like there's butterflies

06:56.016 --> 06:58.486
-in my stomach or something.
-Yeah. That feels good, right?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.053
I feel frickin' great.
I can't wait for TB

07:00.087 --> 07:03.123
to curb-stomp these fools
by less than 17 points.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.463
(indistinct shouting)

07:14.267 --> 07:15.736
What are you doing here?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.104
I came to watch you practice.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.405
Can't tell if you're amazing

07:18.438 --> 07:19.740
or if all these other chicks
just suck.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.910
Dara! Get your ass back
in the net!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.645
Got to run.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.582
Ooh, whew. Coach is right.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.017
You win the game in practice.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.819
What the hell
are you doing here?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.822
-Oh, did a little research
on your girl. -Gross.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.691
No, not that. Oh, listen to me.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.628
Looked up her stats.
It turns out these girls

07:40.661 --> 07:42.763
are favored to win the gold.
You're making her choose

07:42.796 --> 07:44.865
between her love for you
and her love for the game.

07:44.898 --> 07:45.999
That's not fair.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.636
Jimmy, this has nothing to do
with you.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.837
(scoffs) This has everything
to do with me.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.172
-I was that girl.
-Stop talking.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.507
I know the dedication it takes

07:53.541 --> 07:55.042
-to thrive as a student athlete.
-Oh, my God.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.443
That was 20 years ago!

07:56.476 --> 07:59.212
Are you kidding, Dara?

07:59.246 --> 08:02.449
-Don't think I won't bench
your ass! -(whistle blows)

08:02.482 --> 08:05.786
-He'll do it.
-All right.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.521
COACH:
Oh, God, Melissa, come on!

08:07.555 --> 08:09.056
Let's go, girls!

08:09.089 --> 08:12.325
Knees up! Knees up!

08:12.359 --> 08:14.294
(sighs) Wha...?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.130
What? Uh...

08:17.164 --> 08:19.733
Colonel, (stammers) how the hell
did you get up here?

08:21.168 --> 08:24.738
Ooh, uh, wha...?

08:26.574 --> 08:28.508
Okay.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.878
Well, I must be going.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.512
Good-bye.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.849
(screams)

08:40.621 --> 08:43.657
Okay. You listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.092
I am the only person that cares

08:45.125 --> 08:46.694
if you live or die
in this house.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.495
So if you can move,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.899
you better come clean right now.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.704
Very convincing.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.511
ANNOUNCER (on TV): Patriots
beat the Bills, 55 to 17.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.346
-I think I'm gonna throw up.
-Yeah.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.181
That's just the juice sloshing
around. It'll settle.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.850
I told you not to bet
against Brady.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.085
Dude snaked Gisele
from frickin' Leo.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.854
My dad is gonna kill me.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.089
Relax, it's 100 bucks.
We back in black by dinner.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.859
No. $100,000.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.360
W-What?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.962
The bet. I bet $100,000.

09:21.995 --> 09:25.633
Why?! Why would you do that?!

09:25.666 --> 09:27.534
-Because you told me to.
-I did not!

09:27.567 --> 09:30.103
I said 100.
I very clearly said 100.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.573
-Who bets $100,000?
-Who bets $100?

09:33.607 --> 09:36.409
I wouldn't blow my nose with
$100. We're looking for juice.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.545
Well, you got the juice now,
don't you, buddy?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.280
Oh, my... $100,000?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.215
Against the Buffalo Bills?
With the Russians?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.885
-You stupid, stupid boy.
-Okay, okay.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.586
-What are we gonna do?
-All right, shut up.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.888
That's what you do.
You just shut up

09:47.921 --> 09:50.157
and let me think
for a second, okay?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.962
Sorry, pal. This is a big mess,
and I can't be involved in it.

09:54.995 --> 09:55.829
Good luck.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.731
You can't just leave him
out there.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.566
Uh, yeah, I can. I just did.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.969
Listen to me. We don't want to
be anywhere near that kid

10:02.002 --> 10:03.671
when the Russians come calling.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.105
They are gonna cut him
to pieces.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.840
-DYLAN: Oh, my God!
-I'm s-sorry, buddy.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.642
I didn't realize you were still
hanging around.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.243
DYLAN: Listen, if you don't help
me, then I'm gonna tell my dad

10:10.277 --> 10:12.946
-this was all your idea.
-Okay, yeah.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.015
-Like he's gonna believe
some kid. -No, he's right.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.850
You were the one that made us
thirsty for juice.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.418
You're the one who made
the account.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.154
You're the one that
underestimated the Golden Boy.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.756
(groans)

10:22.790 --> 10:24.191
All right, fine.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.026
-Get in here. It's fine!
-Thank you.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.761
Been in-in deeper holes
than this.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.663
We just, we just got to pull
ourselves out.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.198
We just need a plan B.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.632
What do you got?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.167
JIMMY:
Numbers don't lie, Sabrina.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.936
All right? Ever since you two
have been hooking up,

10:35.969 --> 10:37.504
her save percentage
has plummeted.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.772
(groans) Stop following me!

10:38.806 --> 10:40.540
Ah, then do the right thing!

10:40.573 --> 10:41.942
U-S-A!

10:41.975 --> 10:43.944
-What the hell is your deal?
-U...

10:43.977 --> 10:45.612
Your sister
is committing high treason.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.148
Her girlfriend has the biggest
game of her life this weekend,

10:48.181 --> 10:49.983
and she's gonna get mopped up
because Sabrina

10:50.017 --> 10:52.119
is putting her own interests
above our nation's.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.221
H-Hold on a second.
What game are you talking about?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.455
USA versus Canada, Mick.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.557
I mean, these girls
have worked so hard.

10:57.590 --> 11:01.161
And now they're gonna be sucking
silver for the next four years.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.397
Oh, yeah?
Are-are you sure about that?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.033
Is that, like, a sure thing?

11:06.066 --> 11:09.837
-Yeah, it's a lock.
-Oh.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.475
I got to hand it to you, Mick,
you got balls.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.144
You disappear for months,
and then you call

11:17.177 --> 11:19.646
one day out of the blue,
and you want to bet 100 Gs

11:19.679 --> 11:21.548
on amateur women's soccer.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.150
Yep. Very popular sport.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.418
They're calling it the football
of Europe.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.854
You owe me three grand, Mick.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.421
Let's make it an even 103.

11:28.455 --> 11:32.359
I don't know how you fellas
got mixed up with her,

11:32.392 --> 11:34.094
but my advice to you?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.163
Get out before it's too late.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.098
All right. You're a loan shark.
Get off your high horse.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.668
Tell you what, Mick,
I'll take your bet.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.336
But now I've-I've seen
where you live.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.704
So if you decide to run,

11:44.738 --> 11:46.874
I'm gonna burn this house
to the ground.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.341
With these two guys in it.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.778
-Oh. -All right, relax.
It's an expression.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.881
I meant every word of it.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.418
Do we have a deal?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.056
-(hand cracks)
-(gasps) Ow.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.458
-Oh. Oh. -Oh, my.
-(Mickey squeals)

12:05.492 --> 12:07.027
Pay your debts, Mick.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.996
(Dylan and Chip gasp)

12:10.898 --> 12:12.699
Let's leave town.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.202
No, no, no, no.
No one's going anywhere.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.904
Okay. Well, uh, the juice
has gone bad.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.305
Dylan's pooping blood.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.573
Hey, I told you not to tell
anyone that.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.809
You might want to tell somebody

12:21.842 --> 12:23.110
because that sounds
like an ulcer.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.644
But don't worry, you guys.
This is good.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.979
This is all part of the ride.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.380
It's all part of the journey,
you know?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.716
-I got to go to the bathroom.
-Mm.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.418
I'm gonna get some ice.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.726
Hey. Where's Alexis?

12:39.759 --> 12:40.894
She dumped me.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.395
The bitch dumped me.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.565
What? No, no, no. No.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.067
-Why?
-I have no idea.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.568
She just called me
out of the blue and gave me

12:48.601 --> 12:50.938
some crap about needing to
commit to soccer.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.305
-No.
-JIMMY: Yeah.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.008
Looks like somebody finally
talked some sense into her.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.177
-You did this?
-Yeah, you're damn right.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.079
Somebody's got to
look out for that girl.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.413
Oh, Jimmy, what have you done?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.282
I broke it down for her,
athlete to athlete.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.584
I told her she's very talented,
I told her this is

13:04.617 --> 13:06.019
a great opportunity for her.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.354
And that Sabrina sees her
as a trophy

13:07.387 --> 13:08.788
and she deserves better.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.257
-I can't listen to this anymore.
-Okay, and-- no.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.925
-Their entire life is about...
-Shut up, Jimmy!

13:11.959 --> 13:13.260
I'm not gonna let her throw it

13:13.293 --> 13:16.163
all away on some spoiled
locker-room lizard!

13:16.196 --> 13:18.031
I hope you're happy.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.968
I'm very happy.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.102
(knocking on door)

13:22.135 --> 13:24.938
Hey. Can I come in?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.606
-No.
-Listen.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.375
I think you got to call Alexis.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.144
-Get the hell out of my room.
-She needs to hear your side.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.281
-Why do you care?
-I-I don't. I don't care.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.117
But if you love something,
you need to fight for it.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.685
Who said anything about love?

13:38.718 --> 13:41.288
Well, she loves you.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.656
-That's for sure.
-She dumped me.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.293
Because she was scared. Come on.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.295
Think this through. You know,
she spends her whole day

13:48.328 --> 13:51.031
rolling around in the dirt
with a bunch of meatheads,

13:51.064 --> 13:55.568
and along comes this beautiful,
sophisticated,

13:55.602 --> 13:57.637
intelligent young woman.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.174
Right? That's, that's pretty
intimidating, isn't it?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.310
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.046
So it's just, it's her natural
defense mechanism kicking in.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.714
(stammers) She panicked.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.383
-I mean, yeah, maybe you're
right, but... -Yup.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.353
If she loves me so much,
she can call me. (scoffs)

14:13.386 --> 14:14.988
She's testing you.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.823
She wants to see if you're
the real deal.

14:16.856 --> 14:21.161
Uh, I mean, it's pretty clear
she's begging to be wooed.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.430
All right, yeah, I'll talk
to her after her game tomorrow.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.000
No! No. It's got to be tonight.
It really should be tonight.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.169
She's got some stupid
team dinner tonight.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.339
Okay! Okay. Hey, what says
romance more than dinner?

14:32.372 --> 14:35.008
You know what I mean? You get
down to that romantic dinner,

14:35.042 --> 14:36.176
and you take it over.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.577
You make it about you two.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.846
Yes is the answer!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.681
Yeah! What are you waiting for?
Come on!

14:41.714 --> 14:43.917
-Love can't wait.
You get that girl. -I don't...

14:43.951 --> 14:46.586
(sighs)
Wha...

14:46.619 --> 14:48.455
Hey, what are you...

14:48.488 --> 14:50.290
(gasps)

14:50.323 --> 14:52.926
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Okay, that is it!

14:52.960 --> 14:55.095
Once? Sure. Twice?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.296
(high-pitched):
Yeah, it is possible.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.897
I have seen some crazy things.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.199
But three times?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.534
No. Not three times.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.304
You have been caught with
your hand in the cookie jar,

15:04.337 --> 15:06.139
my friend. I...

15:08.008 --> 15:09.876
Oh...

15:09.909 --> 15:11.644
Okay.

15:11.678 --> 15:15.148
The rules, they are simple.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.650
If you want me to stop,

15:17.684 --> 15:20.653
all you have to do is scream.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.655
(inhales sharply)

15:27.594 --> 15:29.229
(laughing):
Oh!

15:29.262 --> 15:32.232
Okay, Mr. Tough Guy
Military Man.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.567
They have trained you well.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.437
Let's find out how well.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.513
(phone rings)

15:50.017 --> 15:51.418
Jimmy.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.653
-Jimmy, you got to help me. I'm
stuck in a bathroom. -(pounding)

15:53.686 --> 15:57.024
Oh, uh, well,
if it's a female hygiene thing,

15:57.057 --> 15:58.791
I should probably elevate this
to your aunt.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.029
No! No, Mickey told me
to crash Alexis's team dinner,

16:02.062 --> 16:04.031
and now these
thunder-thighed bitches

16:04.064 --> 16:05.932
-are trying to kill me!
-What?

16:05.965 --> 16:06.933
Sabrina, why would you...

16:06.966 --> 16:08.668
Jimmy, just get your ass
down here!

16:08.701 --> 16:10.437
Fine! All right, stay put.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.105
I'm gonna come down there
and talk some sense into 'em,

16:12.139 --> 16:14.274
athlete to athlete.
It is very important

16:14.307 --> 16:16.843
that these girls stay focused,
so any buzzwor...

16:16.876 --> 16:18.711
-Jimmy!
-Yeah, 10-4.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.483
Hey. What's going on?
Where you going?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.818
Well, thanks to you, Sabrina's
about to get her ass smashed

16:25.852 --> 16:29.289
by 20 of the most elite
female athletes in the world.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.690
All right, I'll go with you.
Let's go.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.226
You've done enough.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.629
This is ridiculous, okay?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.331
I-I just came here
to talk to Alexis.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.699
-(tires screech)
-That's all.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.700
Sabrina, go home.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.469
Yeah. Walk away, bitch.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.371
Go back to Greenwich, Yoko.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.706
All right, you know what,
I'm not the reason you guys

16:46.739 --> 16:48.808
-have been sucking lately.
That's on you! -(all shouting)

16:48.841 --> 16:49.976
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.644
She did not mean that, okay?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.213
You guys got a big game
tomorrow.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.647
So-so, you-you go back inside,

16:54.681 --> 16:56.249
you carb up,
and you get some sleep.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.251
Eight hours, all right?

16:58.285 --> 16:59.919
We're gonna take off, all right?
Excuse us.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.189
All right, we'll go this way...
(groans)

17:03.056 --> 17:04.224
(exhales)

17:04.257 --> 17:06.159
-All right, who did that, huh?
-(spits)

17:06.193 --> 17:09.562
Oh, my God.
Darlene, that's disgusting.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.498
-How do you know my name?
-Because I did some research

17:11.531 --> 17:13.032
-on all you guy-- oh.
All right, you know what? -Ew.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.501
Natalie,
that's good physicality.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.269
Guys, let's save it
for tomorrow.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.571
-(grunts)
-This can't... Oh! All right.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.672
Guys... Oh!

17:19.706 --> 17:22.175
All right.
Guys, we're all athletes here.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.577
There's no... Oh!
Oh, please stop.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.580
Oh! You know what,
that really hurt.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.748
(grunts)

17:28.781 --> 17:30.350
(grunts) Oh!

17:30.383 --> 17:31.684
-Get out of here!
-Whoa, whoa!

17:31.718 --> 17:33.453
-I am sorry.
-Jimmy, what the hell, man?!

17:33.486 --> 17:36.189
-That's a reflex!
-(all shouting)

17:36.223 --> 17:38.958
(screaming)

17:38.991 --> 17:41.961
(all shouting)

17:41.994 --> 17:44.197
-(shouting)
-Come on!

17:44.231 --> 17:46.133
Let's go! Come on!

17:46.166 --> 17:48.135
Oh, I'm so sorry!

17:48.168 --> 17:50.237
(shouting)

17:50.270 --> 17:52.539
JIMMY:
I don't want to do this.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.741
(grunting)

17:58.911 --> 18:01.348
(grunting)

18:05.252 --> 18:07.086
(Jimmy shouts)

18:08.755 --> 18:10.690
(grunting)

18:17.930 --> 18:20.133
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

18:20.167 --> 18:23.303
No. Whoa. Oh, Officer,
Officer, these girls got

18:23.336 --> 18:26.005
a big game tomorrow.
I'm not pressing charges.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.840
Get off me, bitch!

18:27.874 --> 18:29.108
Hey, Vicky, don't resist, okay?

18:29.142 --> 18:32.111
You can still post bail
by game time.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.514
(gurgles)

18:34.547 --> 18:36.149
Hey, Alexis?

18:36.183 --> 18:38.218
Can I talk to you for a second?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.787
What do you want, Sabrina?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.489
Uh, I just want to clear
the air, you know?

18:42.522 --> 18:44.257
I-I don't know what
my aunt's boyfriend told you,

18:44.291 --> 18:45.825
but it's not true.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.660
-Sabrina...
-Let me just get this out, okay?

18:47.694 --> 18:50.197
I-I get that I'm different
from the girls

18:50.230 --> 18:51.698
you used to hang out with,
you know?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.167
I'm-I'm cultured
and sophisticated

18:54.201 --> 18:55.835
and petite.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.837
And I realize that
that can be intimidating.

18:57.870 --> 19:02.442
But here's the thing: you
don't need to be scared, okay?

19:02.475 --> 19:05.778
Because, well...
(chuckles)

19:05.812 --> 19:07.514
I love you, too.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.316
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.385
It wasn't
your weird uncle's phone call.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.722
You're shallow. And mean.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.191
And you think that you're better
than everyone, but you're not.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.659
I mean, you're hot.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.562
-(chuckles)
-But your insides are gross.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.897
Your life
is a collection of things

19:24.931 --> 19:27.834
that you think
make you seem interesting.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.536
Like me.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.307
I'm breaking up with you.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.476
You can't do this.
They've worked so hard.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.711
Then they shouldn't have put
a guy in the hospital.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.912
(coach sighs)

19:39.946 --> 19:41.581
What the hell happened here?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.850
Some maniac started a fight
with my girls.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.254
So, what does that mean
for the game tomorrow?

19:47.287 --> 19:49.889
There is no game!
Half my team is in jail!

19:49.922 --> 19:53.360
-So you lost? -Boom, bitch!
We won! We won! -(laughing)

19:53.393 --> 19:56.496
Yeah! The juice is loose!
(laughs)

19:56.529 --> 19:59.098
You certainly know how
to keep things exciting, Mick.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.667
Where the hell'd you come from?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.102
Well, I saw you jump in a car
and peel out.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.504
Raised a couple red flags.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.705
All right, well,
I'm glad it did,

20:05.738 --> 20:07.507
'cause it looks
like you owe me some money.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.609
Well, I suppose
even a blind squirrel

20:09.642 --> 20:12.078
-scores a nut from time to time.
-Yeah.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.880
That's right. It does.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.689
Minus the three you owe me.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.691
-Yeah. -I'm sure
I'll be seeing you soon enough.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.428
Yeah, I bet you will. 'Cause
Mama's got a real hot hand.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.631
(inhales)
Mmm...

20:31.664 --> 20:32.799
Okay.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.203
Here you go. That's...

20:37.236 --> 20:39.406
What do I do with all this?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.708
I-I paid
with my dad's credit card.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.377
That's not my problem, okay?
Stick it in his coat pocket.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.814
O-Or, guys, hold on,
hear me out.

20:47.847 --> 20:52.585
What do you guys know
about the Montreal Alouettes?

20:52.619 --> 20:53.986
I know you can move, Colonel.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.423
And I know you know
I know you can move.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.257
You are making me look
like an idiot,

20:58.291 --> 21:00.327
and I do not appreciate it.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.397
Come on, man!
Do the right thing.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.799
Very well.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.402
We do it my way.

21:09.436 --> 21:12.238
Ugh, I don't know, Colonel.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.341
I don't know
what troubles me more:

21:14.374 --> 21:16.576
that I have to do this

21:16.609 --> 21:19.512
or that I'm going to enjoy it.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.982
Hi, Alba.

21:43.202 --> 21:47.874
I would like to take
this opportunity to apologize.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.943
MICKEY:
Well, you got the juice now!

21:50.977 --> 21:53.012
