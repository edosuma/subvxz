Eight years ago,
I was lead prosecutor

00:04.100 --> 00:05.980
on a murder trial
that divided the country.

00:05.980 --> 00:08.350
When the jury found movie star
Sevvy Johnson

00:08.350 --> 00:10.440
not guilty of double homicide,

00:10.440 --> 00:11.640
I was devastated.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.850
You did everything
you could, Maya.

00:12.850 --> 00:14.190
I walked out of the courtroom

00:14.190 --> 00:16.810
and left that life
and everyone in it behind.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.600
But then the unthinkable
happened.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.600
He killed again.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.850
You have to come back, Maya.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.310
This time, we're gonna get him.

00:22.310 --> 00:24.850
I can't go back to jail.
You won't.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.350
The police know
who the killer is...

00:27.350 --> 00:29.440
Ben Mitchell.
Being back is complicated.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.520
You're supposed to be
ride or die.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.100

where you'd gone.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.350
Nothing and no one
is the same...

00:33.350 --> 00:35.440
You got married.
Yeah.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.480

00:36.480 --> 00:38.060

He gave me this.

on the inside.

00:49.900 --> 00:50.900
They got a search warrant.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.440

34:36.850 --> 34:38.810
I hit a dog when I was
driving home one night.

I should've stopped.

I was about to call 911,

34:53.230 --> 34:55.270
but then that guy
pulled up next to the beach.

34:55.270 --> 34:56.690
He started walking towards
the dead girl,

34:56.690 --> 34:57.850
and when he saw her,
he freaked out.

34:57.850 --> 34:59.230
Wait, Ben Mitchell arrived

34:59.230 --> 35:00.850

For sure.
So I got the hell out of there.

leave me out of it.
