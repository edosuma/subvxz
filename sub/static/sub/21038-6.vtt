WEBVTT

00:42.160 --> 00:44.139
(Birdsong)

01:04.840 --> 01:06.660
Do you really intend to leave us?

01:06.840 --> 01:08.819
As soon as my wound heals.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.984
There be nothin' here for me now, sister.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.141
I must find a new purpose.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.697
A brush with death can have that effect.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.063
And you, brother?

01:18.240 --> 01:21.186
Will our rescue of Dr Enys
be your last act of derrin'-do?

01:21.360 --> 01:24.818
Unless visiting Aunt Agatha
falls into that category!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.217
But, yes.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.259
That's the intention.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.219
Where have I heard that before?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.060
I wish you'd speak to Tom Harry.
He's so heaw—handed.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.867
Any more of it and I'll make him enlist!

02:00.040 --> 02:01.462
(Both chuckle)

02:05.360 --> 02:07.783
Will the war last long, do you think?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.939
With any luck, another 20 years!

02:10.120 --> 02:12.099
It's tripled our income.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.781
How? But...

02:13.960 --> 02:17.020
My dear, do not trouble yourself
to understand the business.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.259
The sun has risen. The day is fine.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.828
I've invited Osborne to visit.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.467
We promised Morwenna more time.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.144
Which she has had,
but there is now more urgency.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.343
Thanks to Ross's luclq rescue
of Lord Falmouth's nephew,

02:29.520 --> 02:32.500
he now has entre into the aristocracy.
And I do not.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.898
Until we're allied to the Godolphins.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.265
So Morvvenna will be wed to Osborne.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.657
And soon.

02:48.880 --> 02:53.579
Well, nephew, you've certainly
set the tongues wagging.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.387
Prison breaks!

02:55.560 --> 02:57.107
Roasting the Frenchies!

02:57.280 --> 02:58.861
Whatever next?

02:59.040 --> 03:01.417
A less perilous venture, Aunt.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.067
Clearing the long field at Nampara.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.457
Dull.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.097
Not for our starving miners.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.226
When George closed Wheal Leisure,
many lost everything.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.267
IfI can give them the land,
at least they can eat.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.419
George will be disappointed.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.503
Perhaps you should inform him
on your way out.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.464
- He's here?
- Returned last week.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.904
- And you didn't think to tell me?
- Why would I?

03:24.080 --> 03:27.538
You're a Poldark.
This is a Poldark house.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.221
Thank you, Aunt.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.346
But I fear I must now devise
another escape from enemy territory.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.499
(Knock at door)

03:36.680 --> 03:38.545
Come in.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.540
Oh. Captain Poldark.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.301
Miss Chynoweth.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.586
It appears my visits here must cease.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.905
Can I rely on you to see
my aunt is cared for?

03:49.080 --> 03:50.866
Of course.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.986
Is Drake...recovering?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.297
Slowly.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.459
He acquitted himself bravely.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.585
Would you like me to convey a message?

03:59.760 --> 04:01.466
Yes. I...

04:04.160 --> 04:05.821
Thank you.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.979
No.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.941
(Child cries)

04:20.120 --> 04:22.099
(Cries)

04:25.680 --> 04:28.342
- (Receding footsteps)
- (Croaking)

04:29.160 --> 04:31.720
What is that...sound?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.499
Surely not?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.020
(Croaking)

04:47.240 --> 04:49.583
I ordered them cleared.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.261
Where the deuce is Tom Harry?

04:52.440 --> 04:54.419
(Massed croaking)

04:58.120 --> 04:59.781
(Laughs)

05:06.880 --> 05:09.223
What is this place? Where am I?

05:10.240 --> 05:12.219
(Man cries out)

05:13.000 --> 05:14.103
(Footsteps approach)

05:14.280 --> 05:17.579
Will you take almond biscuits?
Or shall I send to Truro for marzipan?

05:19.160 --> 05:20.787
My love, I've no appetite.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.939
When I'm hungry, I'll eat.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.459
Shall we go for a drive in the carriage?

05:27.640 --> 05:30.541
- Or make a four at quadrille?
- Caroline, please.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.857
- I hope I'm not intruding?
- Not at all.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.100
You've saved Dwight
from his worst nightmare. Cards.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.665
- How does the patient?
- Very impatient.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.627
And often delirious.
Keeps babbling about rejoining the navy.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.859
That is my profession.
And when I'm recovered...

05:46.040 --> 05:47.302
Scold him, Demelza.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.698
As if he were not needed here by his wife.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.701
And has not earned a life of quiet luxury.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.543
To be enjoyed to the full
once our marriage becomes public.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.301
Is Drake recovering?

05:59.480 --> 06:00.583
Too quick.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.660
When he's mended, he means to leave us.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.057
I understand.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.800
His love is lost. _
A clean slate seems the only option.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.861
But in your case, my love,
it was a dreadful mistake.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.259
See what it led to.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.499
And hope is never as dead as one fears.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.057
Nor marriage between two classes impossible.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.937
You and Ross, Dwight and I,
are we not all proof of that?

06:29.400 --> 06:32.039
Gentlemen, ladies,

06:32.200 --> 06:33.588
I give you our new mine captain,

06:34.600 --> 06:36.340
Mr Zaclq Martin.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.385
Truly,

06:38.560 --> 06:40.664
I feel the honour keenly,

06:40.840 --> 06:43.024
knowin' who stood here before me.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.819
You'll miss it here.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.857
Yet I must go.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.383
When hope's gone, 'tis as well to know it.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.539
If it is gone.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.859
My suspicion, nothing's lost...

07:06.920 --> 07:08.342
...till we say so.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.659
She can't mean for I to try again?

07:17.840 --> 07:19.819
She'd give anythin' for 'ee to stay.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.789
In truth, so would I.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.539
Are the gardeners mistaken?

07:32.960 --> 07:37.579
Has Ross Poldark been making regular visits
in my absence?

07:37.760 --> 07:40.069
To see Aunt Agatha, yes.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.581
That woman has conspired with Ross
against me.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.079
And has clearly been abetted.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.867
By Whom?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.140
You surely don't suggest Geoffrey Charles
is to blame?

07:57.720 --> 08:01.065
But clearly someone must be held responsible.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.102
I did know of Captain Poldark's visits
to Miss Agatha

08:06.280 --> 08:08.703
but felt it was not my place
to question them.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.867
Did you ever meet him here?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.140
Aside from this morning?

08:17.280 --> 08:20.738
Do you mean to tell me he was here

08:20.920 --> 08:22.865
under my very nose?

08:26.960 --> 08:29.337
Am I master here or not?

08:31.280 --> 08:34.260
You will prepare yourself
to meet Mr Whitworth.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.182
I've invited him here and expect you
to give him a warm reception.

08:37.360 --> 08:41.182
Oh, but...I'd hoped for more time.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.740
Miss Chynoweth, if you had any idea of the
agony he suffers whilst awaiting your answer.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.697
He is quite distraught and hardly knows
what to do with himself.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.139
(Moans)

08:58.400 --> 08:59.867
I thought you'd be wed by now.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.019
The delay is deuced awkward.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.179
A man has needs.

09:04.360 --> 09:09.866
And if they remain unfulfilled by a wife,
he must satiate them elsewhere.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.982
And, er, your intended?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.184
Does she have a sturdy or a gentle nature?

09:18.920 --> 09:20.501
What's that to you?

09:20.680 --> 09:23.183
Or me for that matter...

09:23.360 --> 09:25.464
Oh.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.859
WOMAN: Good day, sir!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.181
Oh!

09:37.360 --> 09:38.497
Good day to you both.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.229
- Captain...
- You find me about God's holy work.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.507
I'm sure it's much needed hereabouts.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.459
Indeed.

09:48.640 --> 09:52.701
Yes. It is my mission
to bring fallen women to God.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.979
We all have our cross to bear.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.544
(George speaks angrily in background)

10:03.720 --> 10:07.065
Should 'ee be venturing downstairs, ma'am?
Let me help you back to your room.

10:07.240 --> 10:11.062
What, and have me miss the entertainment?

10:11.240 --> 10:15.939
GEORGE: Were you not instructed to clear
the pond, down to the very last specimen?

10:16.120 --> 10:17.826
And so we did.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.707
So I can't imagine how they came to return.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.666
You will set about the task again.

10:22.840 --> 10:27.186
And this time I want no trace
of the loathsome objects.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.944
When Francis and Ross were boys,
they loved toads.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.499
Ross especially.
He would never have had them killed.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.229
But then, he was not for mindless destruction.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.184
Much prefers a rescue mission.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.624
In France he beat 20 men single-handed.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.904
I believe the reports were exaggerated.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.063
And how do we know he didn't send
in his men while he himself waited outside?

10:52.240 --> 10:54.219
You're not a soldier, George.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.867
You wouldn't understand.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.499
Thank you.

11:05.800 --> 11:10.737
Such an honour, to be allowed to
walk along with such a man.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.138
To bask in his glory.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.904
What you did was no more lawful
than breakin' Jim Carter out of Bodmin

11:17.080 --> 11:20.709
but then you were a felon
and now you're a hero.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.979
The irony has not escaped me.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.225
And how was Caroline?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.823
- And Dwight?
- I don't know... There's something...

11:30.000 --> 11:32.309
It seems to me they're ill at ease.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.029
Dwight's far away
and Caroline just talks.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.425
I suspected as much.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.239
In some ways, bringing Dwight home
was the easy part.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.860
There! There!

11:46.040 --> 11:47.860
(Chuckling)

11:48.040 --> 11:50.497
Drake's toads from last summer
must have bred.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.749
I hope not.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.626
But he did it for us, Wenna.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.022
To make us laugh.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.337
You especially.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.623
L?

11:59.800 --> 12:02.542
He told me he thought
you looked sad sometimes.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.149
And that he'd do anything to make you smile.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.099
Did he really say that?

12:08.280 --> 12:10.020
Do 'ee doubt it?

12:10.200 --> 12:14.864
_ If we see a chance _
to gIve or take pleasure In this world,

12:16.440 --> 12:18.419
ought we not to seize it?

12:19.240 --> 12:23.586
But...surely
we've no right to expect happiness?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.939
All we can do is our duty.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.386
I believe 'tis our duty to find happiness.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.386
In great things, or small.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.539
Like toads.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.737
(Drake and Morwenna laugh)

12:38.320 --> 12:40.663
SERVANT: Master Geoffrey!

12:40.840 --> 12:42.819
I'll return directly.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.504
You shouldn't have done it.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.864
Did 'ee laugh when 'ee saw 'em?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.587
A little.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.739
Then it was worth it.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.220
Please don't attempt it again.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.345
Some things are not worth the risk.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.499
But some are.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.059
Why have you come?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.219
- I sent you away.
- And I went.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.939
Meaning to put you behind me.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.100
But all I could think of was you,

13:33.800 --> 13:36.542
day and night,

13:36.720 --> 13:37.903
sun and moon,

13:38.080 --> 13:40.901
sleepin', wakin', workin', dreamin'.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.299
My life is naught without you.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.899
I think you should go.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.939
Tell me ye wish me to go, then.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.380
For I cannot believe the words
till I know they come from the heart.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.462
Oh, Drake, why do you suppose this
has anything to do with the heart?!

13:59.640 --> 14:01.267
That is not how the world works.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.147
But we are in the world
and must keep to its rules.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.538
- Must we?
- Yes.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.826
- And if you don't know that by now...
- I don't know anythin', Morwenna,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.137
except for what you tell me.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.027
So look me in the eyes
and tell me you don't love me.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.939
I must go.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.859
Will I see 'ee soon?

14:43.520 --> 14:45.977
- I'll send word.
- And I'll send more toads.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.784
(Chuckles) If you were caught...

14:48.960 --> 14:50.302
I shan't be.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.459
Just to know it made 'ee smile...

15:05.840 --> 15:07.341
(Croaking)

15:07.520 --> 15:08.623
Whoa.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.739
(Chuckles)

15:39.160 --> 15:41.139
My love?

15:42.120 --> 15:44.099
Shall we to bed?

15:45.400 --> 15:48.665
Forgive me, I'm so accustomed to
being awake at all hours of the night,

15:48.840 --> 15:50.899
I barely know how to sleep these days.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.419
I was not suggesting sleep.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.543
I think I'll go downstairs and read awhile.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.779
There's much work to catch up on.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.664
Do you think Dwight and Caroline
are ill-suited?

16:25.360 --> 16:30.377
I think Caroline is in love with Dwight,
or rather, the idea of Dwight.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.864
But I don't think she'll ever know him.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.226
Especially now.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.719
Now?

16:37.880 --> 16:40.940
War takes a man places
where no-one can follow.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.421
But if a man's wife cannot help him,
who can?

16:58.640 --> 17:00.346
(Massed croaking)

17:01.360 --> 17:03.817
(Croaking continues)

17:06.400 --> 17:08.379
Where is Tom Harry?!

17:09.320 --> 17:11.299
He did it again, Wenna.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.459
He did it again. (Chuckles)

17:21.040 --> 17:22.462
Well, Ross, should we be off?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.619
I think I know who can help Dwight.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.660
Is there no end to your incompetence?

17:34.840 --> 17:38.662
Beggin' your pardon, sir,
these are not the toads we got rid of before.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.348
These are ordinary toads
as live in the ponds of Marazanvose.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.147
So?

17:45.320 --> 17:49.745
So...maybe they walked here.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.541
Or maybe they've been brought.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.747
Why would anyone do that?

17:55.920 --> 17:58.059
Aye. There's the mystery.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.824
The name of Warleggan
being so popular in the district.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.219
Of course.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.057
Who else knows of my aversion?

18:11.240 --> 18:14.903
Who else would take the trouble
to antagonise me In thIs way?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.027
Ross?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.861
But that's so childish.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.782
But typical of his scheming and malice.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.224
I want five men on guard from tonight.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.617
Cancel all other duties.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.701
The person responsible
will be caught red-handed.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.579
(Whispers)

18:36.160 --> 18:38.060
And did you laugh?

18:38.240 --> 18:39.741
We tried not to...

18:39.920 --> 18:41.421
(Chuckles)

18:41.600 --> 18:44.421
- ...but, really, the croaking was deafening.
- (Both laugh)

18:44.600 --> 18:46.579
Was Mr Warleggan angry?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.548
I left before he was up.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.699
But he will be furious.

18:51.440 --> 18:55.422
Cousin Elizabeth told me he's had
an aversion to toads ever since school.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.306
There was an incident...

18:57.480 --> 18:59.459
What, involvin' Cap'n Ross?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.619
I suspect so.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.627
Then I can't stop now.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.222
Drake, you must.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.379
'Tis not worth the risk.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.066
And did we not agree...

19:12.200 --> 19:14.179
...some things are worth it?

19:19.040 --> 19:21.019
(Whistles)

19:29.360 --> 19:31.339
(Flute plays)

19:38.160 --> 19:40.139
Shall we begin?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.747
The sooner we clear, the sooner we plant.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.383
Thank you, sir.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.299
'Tis a generous thought, Ross, but...

19:51.200 --> 19:53.839
should 'ee not better keep this meadow
for your children?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.787
How much land does a man need?

19:56.960 --> 19:59.986
And besides, people have to eat.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.707
No Drake?

20:02.880 --> 20:04.381
Alas. He be fall'n into sin.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.939
Nay, brother. I believe what he be feelin'
be more akin to love.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.621
But not holy love, sister.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.665
Carnal love be damned in the eyes of the Lord.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.140
Then mayhap the Lord should ope
his eyes wider and see the beauty of the thing.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.504
But the soul, sister?

20:18.680 --> 20:21.137
This so-called "love" may spoil it
for the life to come.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.821
And the life that's now?

20:23.000 --> 20:28.267
Where I stand, there's much
that's pure and good and beautiful,

20:28.440 --> 20:32.024
and I'd sooner worship that
than fret about the next life.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.379
And so, I venture, would Drake.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.186
- (Addresses man) See that line?
- Very good.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.699
Good boy.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.868
You seem feverish, Morwenna.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.065
- Are you unwell?
- Oh.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.982
No, sir, but the air was so bracing today.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.799
You _recollec_t Mr Whitworth
IS to VlSlt us soon?

21:20.960 --> 21:24.339
I know you'll consider the benefits of the match,
not only to yourself

21:24.520 --> 21:26.624
but also to your mother and sisters.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.860
A life of penury,
from which you yourself have been saved.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.109
Yes.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.100
Should I choose to wed Mr Whitworth.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.459
(Men ’5 anguished cries)

21:45.480 --> 21:47.345
Am I dead? Is this hell?

21:47.520 --> 21:48.737
Fire!

21:48.920 --> 21:50.342
DWIGHT: We ’re all in he// now.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.260
Caught you!

21:52.440 --> 21:53.987
(Panﬁng)

21:54.160 --> 21:56.139
What's the matter?

21:56.920 --> 21:58.899
Dwight?
(Sobs)

22:01.280 --> 22:03.259
What is it? Tell me.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.622
Come, my love,
you never used to be so girlish.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.859
Shall I be forced to prescribe hartshorn?

22:11.360 --> 22:13.817
Opium is more effective.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.379
For what?

22:17.280 --> 22:19.259
Inducing oblivion.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.420
What's happened to my husband?

22:35.600 --> 22:38.262
I've brought someone
who may help you find him.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.019
(Dog barks)

22:47.520 --> 22:50.023
Beg pardon, ma'am, is Drake Came here?

22:50.920 --> 22:52.501
I've a message for him.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.659
He may be in danger.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.302
But you're not a surgeon.
How can you help him?

23:03.640 --> 23:05.346
Armitage.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.025
- Excuse me.
- (Laughs)

23:11.760 --> 23:13.739
You have no idea how glad I am to see you.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.865
I don't understand.
He safely returned to his wife and home.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.019
Why is that not enough?

23:21.640 --> 23:23.619
Be patient with him.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.699
(Men talk)

23:49.080 --> 23:51.105
Crooked little mite, isn't he?

23:51.280 --> 23:53.419
Rickets is a cruel disease.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.420
No sign of it yet of course.

23:55.600 --> 24:00.025
It'll be later when he goes to school and
can't run fast enough to escape the bullies.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.861
Boys can be cruel, can't they?

24:02.040 --> 24:05.703
Especially to one that gives himself airs.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.781
Especially to one
whose grandfather was a blacksmith.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.463
As your nephews
never ceased to remind me.

24:11.640 --> 24:16.179
Georgie, it was not your grandfather
they mocked

24:16.360 --> 24:19.500
but your pitiful attempts to deny him.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.944
That's what you never understood.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.466
This time next year
we'll be harvestin' oats an' barley.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.059
By the grace of God.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.664
I'm away home to put the children to bed.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.979
Take my share of the vittles.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.060
In exchange for my share of ale?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.821
A proper day's work.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.423
Good ale, licky pie.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.579
What more could a man want for?

25:01.400 --> 25:03.140
(Signs)

25:03.320 --> 25:04.389
Oh...

25:04.560 --> 25:07.381
Note brought for Mr Drake.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.746
Master Geoffrey couldn't find him at the cottage,
so left it 'ere.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.899
Why would he write to Drake?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.899
What do it mean,
"George has set a trap"?

25:21.080 --> 25:23.662
"To catch whoever is
filling the pond with toads"?

25:25.920 --> 25:27.899
Do he think it's Drake?

25:29.800 --> 25:32.701
- Is it Drake?
- Very like.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.701
Judas! Then he's walkin' straight into it.
I must go and stop him.

25:35.880 --> 25:37.859
- Nay, maid!
- Not a word to Ross.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.979
(Toads croaking)

25:51.040 --> 25:53.019
(Urges horse on)

25:54.920 --> 25:56.899
(Croaking)

26:11.640 --> 26:13.858
(Croaking)

26:15.080 --> 26:16.399
(Twig snaps)

26:26.720 --> 26:28.699
(Gasps)

27:01.080 --> 27:03.457
TOM HARRY: That way! After 'em!

27:15.360 --> 27:17.066
(Cries out and groans)

27:30.360 --> 27:32.339
(Panﬁng)

27:46.800 --> 27:50.224
DEMELZA: Prudie shouldn't have told you.
ROSS: Of course she should.

27:50.400 --> 27:54.143
You young fool.
Suppose you'd been recognised?

27:54.320 --> 27:55.582
Or your sister?

27:55.760 --> 27:57.341
I wasn't thinkin'...

27:57.520 --> 28:03.186
You cannot imagine how delighted George
would be to have you, or me, in his power.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.827
What the hell were you playing at?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.979
Toads.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.345
Toads?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.499
I was fillin' his pond with 'em.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.579
Continuing a family tradition.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.899
How?

28:23.720 --> 28:26.382
When we were at school...

28:26.560 --> 28:28.346
I used to fill his breeches with 'em.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.339
(Both laugh)

28:37.240 --> 28:40.220
You let them escape
and failed even to identify them?

28:40.800 --> 28:43.018
But of course it was Ross.
I'm not an idiot.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.180
There's no-one else would go
out of their way to vex me in this manner.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.419
(Geoffrey Charles chuckles)

28:53.200 --> 28:55.577
Did I mention I've good news from Harrow?

28:55.760 --> 28:58.137
Geoffrey Charles is to start there next term.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.867
Oh...

29:05.040 --> 29:07.383
Fine thought, is it not?

29:07.560 --> 29:10.779
A new home and new friends?

29:19.240 --> 29:21.219
(Clears throat)

29:26.880 --> 29:28.859
Master Geoffrey.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.101
Agh. Ooh.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.707
Did I hurt you?

29:37.880 --> 29:39.984
My wound from the rescue of Dr Enys.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.980
Not from carrying toads, then?

29:42.160 --> 29:43.627
(Both chuckle)

29:43.800 --> 29:48.260
Uncle George had men on guard all night
and still they couldn't catch you.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.580
- Well, fancy that.
- It was you, wasn't it?

29:52.800 --> 29:53.983
Lord, I'll miss you.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.469
Uncle George is sending me away to school.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.179
Oh. Then I'll miss 'ee too.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.498
And Miss Morwenna... What'll
she do with herself when you've gone?

30:04.680 --> 30:07.945
Oh, she'll have no time to think of me
once she's wed.

30:08.120 --> 30:11.180
Wed? To who?

30:11.360 --> 30:14.466
Oh, a clergyman, I think.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.189
Uncle George arranged it.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.499
A Mr Whitworth?

30:19.680 --> 30:21.705
What do Morwenna say?

30:21.880 --> 30:23.984
Oh, I don't believe she's overly keen

30:24.160 --> 30:26.378
but Mama said it's a great match,

30:26.560 --> 30:29.427
so I expect
she'll come around soon enough.

30:34.200 --> 30:39.069
You've been a great friend to me, Drake,
sO...I've brought you a gift.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.346
Oh, no, Master Geoffrey,
'tis enough to have had your friendship.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.779
You can open it later if you'd rather.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.219
I'll be offended if you don't take it.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.779
On one condition.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.179
That you carry a message to Miss Morwenna.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.339
Of course.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.384
So the boy will go away to Harrow.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.265
Yes.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.659
And if it takes a fortnight there and back,
what of it?

31:21.200 --> 31:22.303
A fortnight?

31:22.480 --> 31:26.064
Two weeks travelling
means two weeks less at home.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.219
Which is surely the intention?

31:28.400 --> 31:33.337
The intention is to provide my stepson
with the best education money can buy.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.399
And there was I thinking it was to
get him away from his mother,

31:38.080 --> 31:41.106
so the crooked mite can take his place.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.699
Call Tom Harry.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.025
Is it your wound?

32:29.200 --> 32:32.897
Nay. That luggard Tom Harry
catch'd I such a clout.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.699
Let me see.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.299
So you know.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.386
I'm to be wed.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.067
Why have 'ee kept it from me?

33:40.240 --> 33:43.869
Oh, Drake,
for so long I've tried to keep it from myself.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.267
You must know I've no love
for any man except...

33:50.880 --> 33:52.859
What's the use in saying it?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.137
We can never be together.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.299
Why can't we?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.181
Cos I'm low-born?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.865
Cos I bring nothin'?

34:03.760 --> 34:06.263
Not money, not a home, not a good name...

34:06.440 --> 34:08.419
Do you think I care about that?

34:09.680 --> 34:11.500
S'pose I did ask 'ee to wait.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.984
Till I've made a goodly livin',
till I can provide for 'ee proper?

34:19.560 --> 34:21.539
Look. Say nothin' now.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.861
Go home...consider all I've said.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.617
Give me answer when you're ready.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.426
Soon, then. I will give it soon.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.066
(Grunts)

35:03.040 --> 35:04.462
(Exhales)

35:06.640 --> 35:10.622
Be it sacrilege to say so,
I believe there be miracles after all.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.149
Of what nature?

35:12.320 --> 35:15.300
Miss M0rwen_na's to refuse Mr Whitworth
an' gIve her hand to you?

35:15.480 --> 35:16.947
Can it be so?

35:17.120 --> 35:18.906
When I've earned enough to provide for her.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.502
Ross an' I could help you.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.660
Are you sure Miss Chynoweth
has the strength to stand up to George?

35:23.840 --> 35:25.182
She did say so.

35:25.360 --> 35:29.262
Well, I think if she truly love Drake,
there's naught that could sway her.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.826
- Are you out of your mind?
- I beg you will forgive me.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.260
I cannot accept Mr Whitworth's hand.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.385
It's not as if there's any urgency to be rid of her.

35:56.880 --> 36:00.020
Keeping her means we can delay
sending Geoffrey Charles away to school.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.417
My dear, you forget one thing.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.263
The desirability of aligning ourselves
with the Godolphins.

36:05.800 --> 36:10.146
And are we now to be thwarted by some
nonsensical ideas of girlish sentiment?

36:10.320 --> 36:11.867
(Door opens)

36:14.520 --> 36:16.499
Well?

36:24.400 --> 36:26.379
GEORGE: Morwenna!

36:26.560 --> 36:28.107
Perhaps you can clarify something?

36:28.280 --> 36:31.067
How long have you been meeting
with Drake Came?

36:34.720 --> 36:37.507
L...er...

36:37.920 --> 36:39.899
Six months? A year?

36:40.720 --> 36:43.359
I've questioned the servants.
It appears you've seen him regularly.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.626
And have embroiled Geoffrey Charles
in your deceit.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.109
It was Geoffrey Charles
who first took a liking to him.

36:49.280 --> 36:54.866
And I thought, because he was
a Poldark relative, what harm could there be?

36:55.040 --> 37:00.103
What harm in fraternising
with a relative of my sworn enemy?

37:00.280 --> 37:02.657
I was glad to see Geoffrey Charles so happy.

37:03.800 --> 37:07.099
And yes, I entered into that happiness

37:07.280 --> 37:10.420
and...a|lowed Drake to become fond of me

37:10.600 --> 37:12.465
and...l of him.

37:12.640 --> 37:16.189
And as a consequence, now refuse
the impeccable match we've arranged.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.386
Instead have given yourself
to an illiterate miner.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.902
I have not given myself...

37:21.080 --> 37:25.585
Nevertheless, it's plain that our family
is now tainted by its association with you.

37:25.760 --> 37:28.820
Mr Whitworth must, of course,
be released from his obligation.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.879
And you must be sent home to your mother,
as soon as it can be arranged.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.984
I understand.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.537
(Door opens and closes)

37:47.960 --> 37:50.622
She does not appear at all dismayed.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.179
I thought Caroline was different.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.339
I thought she'd have imagination.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.580
Yet she seems incapable of imagining
what it's like to come home...

38:18.640 --> 38:21.382
...to a life which is utterly vacuous.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.425
My mother's no different.

38:24.600 --> 38:28.058
She tries to tell me of the latest intrigues,
the newest fashions.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.141
DWIGHT: Does that not infuriate you?
- All the time.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.823
And then I remember that...

38:36.040 --> 38:40.818
...she's not lived as I_ have lived -
as we have lived.

38:47.120 --> 38:50.180
For my birthday I want a new gown.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.942
Let Mistress Trelask come
and take measurements.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.667
Preferably for your coffin.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.580
And have the date marked in the family Bible

39:00.760 --> 39:04.389
as proof that I outlasted

39:04.560 --> 39:07.779
any Poldark afore me.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.986
(Chuckles)

39:13.040 --> 39:14.302
Oh, Geoffrey, that reminds me:

39:14.480 --> 39:17.586
this morning I noticed your Bible
was not in its place beside the bed.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.739
Has it been moved?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.745
(Creaking)

39:34.400 --> 39:35.867
'Tis good of 'ee to help, sister.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.498
I must make the most of it.
Someone else may be here next year!

39:39.680 --> 39:41.659
(Clucking)

39:46.480 --> 39:48.186
What business have 'ee here?

39:48.360 --> 39:51.022
You stay here an' keep guard.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.100
You can't go in there. That's trespassing!

39:53.280 --> 39:55.942
You can't just... What do 'ee want?

39:56.640 --> 40:00.144
- What do 'ee think to find?
- This be a God-fearin', law-abidin' house.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.700
You can't take that.
'Twas a gift from a friend.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.658
Drake Came,
I have orders to take you to Truro Jail.

40:09.840 --> 40:10.943
On what charge?

40:11.120 --> 40:13.827
Theft of a valuable Bible
from the house of Mr George Warleggan.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.821
Bib_le? _
I never even open'd it to see what it was.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.384
Judas!
I'd no idea 'twas such a fine thing!

40:24.560 --> 40:26.346
Why would he give it to me?
Its worth must be...

40:26.520 --> 40:30.422
- Upwards of 40 shillings?
- This is a mistake.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.659
This Bible, 'twas a gift!

40:32.840 --> 40:34.819
Take him away!

40:35.120 --> 40:37.384
- Uh...
- 'Ee have no proof it were theft!

40:38.080 --> 40:39.707
I tell you, 'twas freely given!

40:51.560 --> 40:53.061
Describe it to me.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.265
Leather. Very ornate.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.226
With a silver clasp an' buckle.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.626
Tom Harry said its worth
could be upward of 40 shillings.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.186
(Groans) Damn it.

41:04.680 --> 41:05.749
What?

41:05.920 --> 41:09.344
Theft of goods worth 40 shillings or more
is a capital of fence.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.704
Capital?

41:11.880 --> 41:13.859
Well, you mean Drake could hang?

41:15.200 --> 41:16.906
We must tell them there's been a mistake!

41:17.080 --> 41:20.425
Drake's not the sort to _steal.
I'll go an' plead before the magistrate myself.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.579
A good plan but for one thing.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.020
The magistrate is George.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.829
What?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.503
Why else d'you think he's arranged it this way?

41:29.680 --> 41:33.502
Not only will your pleas fall on deaf ears,
he'll be all the more vicious with the sentencing.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.865
Judas, Ross!
Why could you not have been magistrate?

41:37.040 --> 41:39.258
Why did you turn down the chance
when 'twas offered?

41:39.440 --> 41:41.624
The thought has occurred to me.

41:43.320 --> 41:45.299
So what's to be done?

41:52.400 --> 41:53.981
(Keys jangle)

42:07.920 --> 42:09.785
(Cell doors clanging)

42:09.960 --> 42:11.939
(Keys jangling)

42:36.720 --> 42:38.699
(Muttering to himself)

42:50.200 --> 42:52.179
(George continues muttering)

43:01.360 --> 43:05.023
Ah! The hero of Quimper!

43:06.720 --> 43:08.381
How dull it must seem to be home.

43:09.520 --> 43:14.139
On the contrary - since your decision
to prosecute my brother-in-law.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.780
- You admit the connection?
- Should I be ashamed of it?

43:18.320 --> 43:22.905
- To be related to a thief?
- He's no such thing, as you well know.

43:23.440 --> 43:27.217
- Geoffrey Charles...
- Is a child whose emotions are easily played on.

43:27.400 --> 43:31.939
Your brother-in-law insinuated himself
into his affections - into this household -

43:32.120 --> 43:34.941
where he contrived _to steal
a valuable family item,

43:35.120 --> 43:37.384
hoping no doubt to turn it into ready money.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.903
He is a Methodist. How likely is that?

43:40.080 --> 43:43.823
Furthermore, he callously engaged
the affections of an impressionable young girl.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.346
And finally, deliberately polluted my grounds,
on several occasions this summer.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.106
With what?

43:54.440 --> 43:58.501
A type of...amphibian.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.942
That was wrong of him.

44:09.560 --> 44:14.179
George, my brother-in-law appears to have
a deep attachment

44:14.360 --> 44:16.817
for Geoffrey Charles and Morvvenna,
and they for him.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.461
His attempts to gain influence over two naive,
young gentlefolk is an intolerable presumption.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.421
Because of the disparity in station?

44:24.600 --> 44:26.977
But have you yourself not so presumed?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.469
In marrying Elizabeth?

44:30.640 --> 44:31.982
Get out of my house.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.139
One moment.

44:35.960 --> 44:40.340
I ask you to consider whether we
can achieve a settlement out of court?

44:40.760 --> 44:42.341
If only for the sake of our wives.

44:42.520 --> 44:46.342
Your wife is no concern of mine.
And Elizabeth has no interest in the matter.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.420
Nor her cousin, Miss Chynoweth?

44:48.600 --> 44:50.943
When this case comes to court
her involvement Will be known

44:51.120 --> 44:52.701
at considerable harm to her reputation.

44:52.880 --> 44:56.020
Miss Chynoweth has compromised
herself, so is being sent home to her mother.

44:56.200 --> 45:00.022
Her engagement to Mr Whitworth is at an end.
Likewise her association with this family.

45:00.200 --> 45:04.079
So you can dismiss any thoughts
of blackmailing me into submission.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.345
Let him go, George.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.067
The boy is charged.
There's nothing more to say.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.179
(Shuffles papers, clears throat)

45:21.280 --> 45:23.259
Very well.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.625
There's unrest in the district.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.819
- There's always unrest in the district.
- But more so...

45:39.920 --> 45:42.297
...since the fencing of common land...

45:43.840 --> 45:45.979
...taking back a meeting house...

45:47.400 --> 45:49.903
...shutting down a mine while still in profit.

45:52.080 --> 45:56.346
Only my influence has prevented
a repetition of the attack

45:56.520 --> 45:58.704
which occurred on your house last year.

46:00.120 --> 46:04.625
If Drake Came hangs, the people will rise up
and I will be powerless to stop them.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.860
Idle threats.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.544
Are you sure?

46:24.800 --> 46:26.779
(Door shuts)

46:32.360 --> 46:34.419
You make me ashamed, Armitage.

46:36.040 --> 46:41.057
You are the navigator, I the physician,
yet you have found the cure.

46:42.320 --> 46:47.587
Not the cure - but a direction -
by which we may come at a cure.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.898
And if that doesn't work,
there's always poetry!

46:55.000 --> 46:56.979
(Both laugh)

47:15.280 --> 47:16.668
(Horse whinnies)

47:20.320 --> 47:23.460
- So Drake will hang?
- Not ifI can help it.

47:23.640 --> 47:26.620
- Where are you goin'?
- To engage an attorney.

47:28.160 --> 47:32.347
To discover who else is on the bench
so I may throw myself on their mercy.

47:32.520 --> 47:36.297
And to ask Dwight Enys and Hugh Armitage
to plead on Drake's behalf.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.342
God forgive me. I've failed.

47:42.520 --> 47:43.589
No, Sam.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.399
All these years I spent tryin' to snatch souls
from the foul Fiend.

47:46.560 --> 47:49.142
I can't save my own brother
from the noose.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.785
Of course I'll testify.
But do you think it'll do any good?

47:56.960 --> 47:58.939
I've no idea.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.904
But I can't let him die without a fight.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.459
You're a good friend, Ross.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.019
I won't forget what you did for me.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.145
I wish there was a way to repay you.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.587
There is.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.580
Tell Caroline.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.307
What?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.219
- How it stands with you now.
- She'll never understand.

48:24.200 --> 48:25.519
Try her.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.640
I wonder, my clear, is there a better way?

48:42.800 --> 48:45.746
Of course, I endorse your right
to see the boy punished.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.787
But Ross was very clear
about the consequences.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.427
Are you afraid of him?

48:50.600 --> 48:55.583
I only mean that if there was a way
to compromise without seeming to yield.

48:55.760 --> 48:58.627
WHITWORTH:
I need no announcing! Of course they'll see me!

49:11.440 --> 49:14.819
I'm here to inform you
that there are now several other parties

49:15.000 --> 49:17.423
clamouring to become Mrs Whitworth.

49:17.600 --> 49:21.900
And since Miss Chynoweth seems blind
to the advantages of our proposed match,

49:22.080 --> 49:24.901
I must beg to be released from my obligation.

49:26.440 --> 49:28.465
Of course, if you wish.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.619
One moment, sir.

49:36.800 --> 49:39.439
Would you excuse us for five minutes?

49:39.600 --> 49:42.057
By all means. (Chuckles)

49:50.760 --> 49:52.546
Is this not good news?

49:52.720 --> 49:55.621
Now we need not_ tell him
of Morwenna's disgrace.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.177
It is excellent news.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.339
But not for that reason.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.179
Ah.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.220
(Door closes)

50:28.320 --> 50:31.460
You know, do you not,
that we wish only the best for you?

50:31.640 --> 50:34.985
'Tis a pity such kindness extends no further.

50:35.600 --> 50:39.582
- For then an innocent man would not lie in jail.
- You seem very sure he's innocent.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.102
I would stake my life on it.

50:42.480 --> 50:46.223
And what, I wonder,
would you stake to see him acquitted?

50:54.200 --> 50:56.065
GUARD: Come on, boy, let's be having you.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.219
(Distant shouting)

51:02.440 --> 51:06.217
I only hope my testimony will be as much use
to Drake as it was for Ross in Bodmin.

51:06.400 --> 51:10.348
You're an escaped prisoner-of—war and a hero!
If they don't heed you...

51:10.520 --> 51:13.705
Let us pray, sister. 'Tis all we can do.

51:15.360 --> 51:19.103
Save your breath.
It may not be needed after all.

51:27.040 --> 51:30.589
- I can't believe they let you go!
- The charge was just dropp'd.

51:30.760 --> 51:35.504
- Lord knows why!
- Truly He move in mysterious ways!

51:35.680 --> 51:38.057
What will 'ee do now, Master Drake?
How will 'ee celebrate?

51:38.240 --> 51:41.585
By accepting my offer to find him a share
in a profitable business.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.062
So he may go and ask
for the hand of a certain young lady.

51:45.240 --> 51:48.664
- Oh, is she free?
- Sent home to her mother in disgrace.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.460
- The engagement's off.
DRAKE: Ah!

51:52.600 --> 51:54.739
(Laughs happily)

52:32.760 --> 52:35.467
Ross told me I must tell you...

52:37.480 --> 52:39.425
You're leaving me.

52:40.560 --> 52:41.629
No.

52:44.080 --> 52:45.980
My desire to return to the Navy...

52:47.000 --> 52:49.218
...is not for want of love for you,

52:49.400 --> 52:52.540
but for want of knowing
how to live in this world.

52:54.360 --> 52:57.784
This place - lovely as it is -
now seems alien to me.

52:59.120 --> 53:04.501
Accustomed to the cries of wounded men,
the quiet...appals me.

53:06.720 --> 53:11.840
I have slept so long on filthy straw
that soft linen seems wanton luxury.

53:14.440 --> 53:19.707
Having lived in the shadow of the ﬁring squad,
the least noise makes me scream.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.747
And every breath I take makes me feel guilt...

53:27.360 --> 53:31.387
...that I am here and others are not.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.260
You think me...ungrateful...

53:37.440 --> 53:41.137
if I decline an invitation,
or some delicacy you've prepared.

53:41.320 --> 53:47.099
But, in truth, I've no appetite...
for food or society.

53:49.520 --> 53:53.945
All I wish is to hide away until the world
no longer seems strange to me.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.103
Is that why Ross sent for Hugh Armitage?

54:04.760 --> 54:06.546
There is a...

54:07.160 --> 54:12.280
There is a kind of bond between men
who have seen atrocities and survived.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.743
A need to talk,
until all the horror is talked away.

54:18.760 --> 54:20.227
I'll not have you hear such things.

54:20.400 --> 54:24.063
Till Hugh came,
I knew not how to be rid of them.

54:25.240 --> 54:27.219
And are you now rid of them?

54:34.200 --> 54:36.907
It's...it's a beginning.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.545
Can you bear with me?

54:46.160 --> 54:49.539
I can bear anything.
Now that I know I've not lost your love.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.499
(Door opens)

55:06.040 --> 55:08.941
I think congratulations are in order.

55:11.360 --> 55:14.579
One stone. Many birds.

55:27.320 --> 55:29.902
DEMELZA: A boat-yard, mebbe.
DRAKE: Or a smithy.

55:30.080 --> 55:32.025
- With its own cottage.
- Not as it need be grand.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.703
- Miss Morwenna have no airs an' graces.
- Nay.

55:34.880 --> 55:38.145
I believe she'd be content with a sty
if she have you alongside her!

55:38.320 --> 55:40.299
Note just come from Trenwith.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.547
It's Aunt Agatha's hand.
