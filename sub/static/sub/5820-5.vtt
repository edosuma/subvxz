WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.243
( Birds chirping )

00:51.760 --> 00:54.650
Michonne:
The town was overrun.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.087
He split off with Nicholas.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.568
He had this idea that...

01:00.720 --> 01:05.361
if he lit a fire, it would stop
the walkers from coming here.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.921
I tried to go instead.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.481
I wanted to.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.608
The fire never got lit.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.802
We had to keep going.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.928
I'm sorry.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.240
He said if he got stuck,

01:24.400 --> 01:26.243
he would find a way
to send us a signal.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.606
Maggie:
A Signal?

01:27.760 --> 01:29.762
Rick:
Open the gate!

01:35.320 --> 01:36.606
Rick:
Open the gate!

01:36.760 --> 01:39.764
(walkers growling )

01:55.840 --> 01:59.925
Open the gate now!

02:00.080 --> 02:02.242
( Metal clanks )

02:05.160 --> 02:06.810
( snarling )

02:06.960 --> 02:08.291
(grunts)

02:23.720 --> 02:27.281
( snarling )

02:39.480 --> 02:42.290
( theme music playing )

03:16.520 --> 03:20.002
(growling )

03:34.040 --> 03:37.044
( growling continues )

03:44.640 --> 03:45.801
You can hear it.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.171
Some of you saw it.

03:50.320 --> 03:54.006
They got back here,
half of them.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.209
Still enough
to surround us 20 deep.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.130
Look, I know you're scared.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.965
You haven't seen
anything like this.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.203
You haven't been through
anything like this.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.170
But we're safe for now.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.168
The panel the truck hit
seems intact.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.043
We reinforced it
just in case.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.488
Either way, the wall's
gonna hold together.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.444
Can you?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.845
Rick: The others,
they're gonna be back.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.610
They're gonna be back.

04:38.120 --> 04:43.524
Daryl, Abraham, Sasha,
they have vehicles.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.564
They're gonna lead 'em away,
just like the others.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.048
And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna
walk back through the front gate after.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.043
They know
what they're doing,

04:52.200 --> 04:56.524
and we know
what we need to do.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.921
We keep noise to a minimum.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.570
Pull our blinds at night.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.008
Even better, keep the lights out.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.484
We'll try to make this place
as quiet as a graveyard,

05:09.640 --> 05:10.880
see if they move on.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.128
This place
is a graveyard.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.329
( Banging, growling continue )

05:22.840 --> 05:25.491
The quarry broke open

05:25.640 --> 05:28.405
and those walkers
were heading this way.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.245
All of them.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.084
The plan that Rick
put into place

05:36.240 --> 05:38.481
stopped that
from happening.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.961
He got half of them away.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.522
I was out there
recruiting with Daryl.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.243
I wanted to try to get into a cannery
and scavenge,

05:54.400 --> 05:57.882
and Daryl wanted
to keep looking for people.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.209
We did what I wanted...

06:03.240 --> 06:05.766
...and we wound up in a trap
set by those people.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.161
And I lost my pack.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.051
They must've followed our tracks.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.328
Those people who attacked us...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.287
They found their way back here
because of me.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.162
There'll be more to talk about.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.484
Tobin:
Deanna?

06:45.920 --> 06:47.410
Deanna?

07:01.280 --> 07:03.521
( Sighs )

07:20.000 --> 07:23.004
(walkers growling,
thudding )

07:59.120 --> 08:00.804
Don't.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.650
(grunts)

08:04.800 --> 08:06.165
( panting )

08:06.320 --> 08:08.721
We don't bury killers
inside the walls.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.650
( Sighs )

08:14.320 --> 08:18.325
We aren't going out there.
So what do we do?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.569
We wait.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.169
I can't even make
two meals out of this.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.648
The soups and sauces can be stretched
out with some extra water.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.486
What difference does that make
if we'll be dead tomorrow?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.250
- We have to ration now--
- I can't.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.803
I can't spend whatever time
I have left watching my family starve.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.889
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.371
Sorry, Olivia.
I just don't see the point.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.890
Spencer:
Hey. Hey!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.530
Stop.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.728
Right now,
stop it.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.042
This stuff
is for everyone.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.407
We need to make it last
if we're gonna survive.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.370
Why don't you go make sure
the gate's closed, Spencer?

09:12.520 --> 09:15.126
Yeah.
That was me.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.731
I did that.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.127
But that truck
outside the walls,

09:22.280 --> 09:25.329
it'd be inside
if it wasn't for me.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.642
I did that, too.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.964
If I didn't, maybe we wouldn't
be talking right now.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.809
Where were you, Bruce?

09:39.480 --> 09:44.008
Doing this will start us down a road
where nothing matters.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.606
Where no one else
matters.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.803
And then we'll all look back
at this moment right now

09:51.960 --> 09:54.167
as when we destroyed
this place.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.851
( Distant walkers growling )

10:43.640 --> 10:46.644
( banging )

11:37.000 --> 11:38.843
You're going out?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.407
The flashlights,
the rebar, the rope.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.806
You lower them off the wall
a good distance apart,

11:51.960 --> 11:53.769
maybe spin them.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.844
That way, the walkers
are drawn to each one

11:57.000 --> 11:58.889
and you open up a path.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.324
Now you're gearing up.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.328
Just waiting for dark, right?

12:14.160 --> 12:19.849
What happens when you twist an ankle
jumping down?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.889
Hmm?

12:22.040 --> 12:24.168
Or you just get slowed down
by one of them

12:24.320 --> 12:26.129
and then you have to deal
with all of them?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.004
I can't let you do this.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.090
You can't stop me.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.604
( Sighs )

12:39.760 --> 12:41.569
I'm going to help you.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.204
And I know
a safer way out.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.249
( Glass breaks )

13:58.800 --> 14:00.689
( groans )

14:02.600 --> 14:04.887
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.361
L__
( chuckles )

14:07.520 --> 14:09.010
My bad.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.849
Are you drunk?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.525
Getting there.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.688
This came
from the pantry.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.522
You-- you stole it?

14:31.720 --> 14:33.370
I wouldn't call it that.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.728
So what you
told everyone...

14:44.040 --> 14:45.405
that was
just bullshit?

14:45.560 --> 14:48.723
No. If they all went in
and raided the pantry

14:48.880 --> 14:52.248
and everyone knew it, saw it,

14:52.400 --> 14:54.402
then that would be the end.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.131
But one person?

14:57.280 --> 15:00.443
One person, and no one ever
would know.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.644
So, why not me?

15:05.840 --> 15:07.524
I stopped that little run
at the bank.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.045
I deserve a reward.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.443
One last celebration.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.484
Because they were right, Mom,

15:15.680 --> 15:18.604
and you know it.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.808
We're all gonna
be dead real soon.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.325
Damn it, Spencer!

15:22.520 --> 15:25.524
Me? Now that is some bullshit!

15:25.680 --> 15:27.682
You're the reason
we're so screwed.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.285
You made us this way.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.124
We were never safe here.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.926
But you didn't want to see that,
you didn't want us to see that.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.287
You just wanted to dream.

15:36.440 --> 15:40.286
What happened
to Dad, to Aiden?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.885
That's all you.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.007
( Soft clattering )

16:14.720 --> 16:17.724
( distant walkers growling )

16:20.800 --> 16:22.768
( banging )

16:22.960 --> 16:24.849
Carl:
Hey.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.528
You okay?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.603
Ron:
Why wouldn't I be?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.163
Have you seen Enid?

16:36.320 --> 16:39.449
Not since I saw her with you.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.847
I think she went over the wall
just before the herd came

16:42.000 --> 16:44.321
and now she's
trapped out there.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.045
What makes you think
she isn't dead?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.531
Come on, man.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.010
( Scoffs )

16:55.120 --> 16:56.929
Look...

16:57.080 --> 17:00.209
I'll go find her.
I just need your help.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.569
- If you maybe climb up--
- I'm not helping you, Carl.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.484
This isn't for me.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.483
It's for Enid.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.290
- Your friend.
- My girlfriend.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.204
Or, I mean, 'cause she was
anyway, right?

17:13.359 --> 17:14.441
So you want to just
leave her out there?

17:14.599 --> 17:16.089
I told her to stop
going over the wall,

17:16.240 --> 17:17.890
I told her there's
bad people out there

17:18.040 --> 17:19.609
and that it's stupid
and dangerous.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.489
Not if you know
what you're doing.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.205
Well, I'm not gonna let you go.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.203
Carl.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.970
Carl, you're not going out there.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.043
Back off.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.969
All right.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.527
(coughs)

17:41.680 --> 17:42.761
( panting )

17:42.920 --> 17:45.002
I'll tell your dad.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.323
He'll go out there to find you,
then other people will, too.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.050
And then somebody's gonna die.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.848
Huh?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.647
You saved my life
and now I'm saving yours.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.722
( Steady beeping )

18:28.840 --> 18:30.444
( sniffles )

18:38.840 --> 18:41.810
Denise:
Sorry.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.450
Got away from me.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.325
- ( Sniffles )
- Tara: You're still here.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.409
Don't.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.523
'K33!-

18:50.680 --> 18:53.047
Won't tell you
you're being brave, either.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.326
He hasn't woken up.
His wound's infected.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.323
I don't know
what the hell to do,

19:02.480 --> 19:05.723
so it doesn't really
matter what I'm being.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.882
Yeah, but you're still here.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.043
- Why are you here?
- My head hurts.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.003
On a scale
of one to 10, how bad?

19:18.160 --> 19:19.969
I'm lying-

19:20.120 --> 19:22.691
I'm just checking on you.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.888
Well...

19:27.800 --> 19:28.847
here I am.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.482
( Chuckles )
Clueless on the floor.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.161
You patched people up.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.170
You're helping
make things better.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.125
I think he's gonna die.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.722
And I'm so scared about
what's happening in here

19:45.880 --> 19:49.327
that I can't think
about what's happening out there.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.608
And that's actually good.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.650
And I don't know
what to do with that.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.883
I just want him to live
and for the roamers to go away.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.407
And for a doctor
to show up at the gates

20:00.560 --> 20:02.130
so I can go back
to my apartment

20:02.280 --> 20:04.681
and keep reading
"War and Peace."

20:06.480 --> 20:10.280
But here comes
the end of the world.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.602
He's not dead yet.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.127
I don't know about that.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.448
It's not like I don't feel it.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.048
You know,
being afraid sucks.

20:30.240 --> 20:34.245
( Door opens, closes )

20:57.320 --> 21:00.324
( snarling )

21:07.080 --> 21:08.206
(woman screams )

21:10.440 --> 21:13.250
( snarling continues )

21:50.520 --> 21:54.047
I used to not want to see...

21:54.200 --> 21:56.168
...the way things are.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.522
It's not that I couldn't.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.927
It's that I--
I didn't want to.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.326
But this is what life
looks like now.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.363
We have to see it.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.528
We have to fight it.

22:24.360 --> 22:28.445
If we don't fight, we die.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.284
(walkers banging )

22:53.200 --> 22:54.964
Maggie: I thought you said
we weren't going over.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.248
We're not.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.209
We're going under.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.728
This leads to a sewer

23:03.880 --> 23:05.245
that was part of
the old neighborhood

23:05.440 --> 23:08.569
that was here before
they built this up.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.724
It'll take us
under the wall...

23:13.160 --> 23:14.161
(grunts)

23:14.320 --> 23:17.688
...and hopefully
past the walkers.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.604
Thanks...

23:19.760 --> 23:22.411
but I'm going
on my own from here.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.643
- Maggie...
- No.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.569
Please.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.287
I can't-- I can't watch more names
go up on that wall.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.049
(liquid sloshing)

23:38.200 --> 23:40.248
- Maggie: if he's alive--
- Aaron: If?

23:40.400 --> 23:42.607
He told Michonne he would've found
some way to signal us

23:42.760 --> 23:44.171
if he got out.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.961
If he's alive or he's hurt
or trapped, maybe taken.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.566
If he's alive, he needs my help.
That's why I'm doing this.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.927
And if he's dead,
I don't want to be waiting on him.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.927
None of this is your fault.
You don't need to do this.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.490
People are dead.
I was a part of that.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.364
And I have
to live with that.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.488
I haven't been down here
since the beginning.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.688
Ah.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.365
Oh.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.807
This ladder must've
fallen a long time ago.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.405
Let's try and get it out of here.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.801
- Yeah.
- On three, ready?

24:38.960 --> 24:41.281
One, two, three.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.283
(grunts)

24:43.440 --> 24:45.966
One, two, three.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.770
Aaron!

24:47.960 --> 24:49.644
Ah.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.649
(winces )

24:51.840 --> 24:54.127
I'm okay.
The ladder caught me.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.170
(walker growling )

25:00.320 --> 25:03.688
( snarling )

25:07.680 --> 25:09.603
( snarling )

25:12.840 --> 25:14.126
(grunting )

25:38.360 --> 25:41.170
( walker splashes )

25:41.320 --> 25:43.322
- You okay?
-( panting )

25:45.560 --> 25:48.404
Yeah. Thank you.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.882
Aaron... your head.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.522
- Come here.
- ( winces )

25:57.680 --> 25:59.569
This could need stitches.
Aaron, just go back.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.210
- No.
- Yes.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.250
- I was just there for you.
- I could have done it.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.406
Just lead the way.
Please?

26:23.680 --> 26:26.729
( Monitor beeping steadily )

26:29.320 --> 26:31.243
Hot damn.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.921
( Monitor beeping faster)

26:47.760 --> 26:50.331
( beeping slows )

26:53.080 --> 26:56.368
( monitor beeping steadily )

26:56.520 --> 26:58.807
Hot damn.

27:01.120 --> 27:05.045
- ( Growling )
- Daryl, Sasha, Abraham, you copy?

27:07.120 --> 27:09.361
Ron:
Rick?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.449
Can I come up?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.125
Yeah.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.883
You haven't seen it.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.491
No.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.649
Enid, she, uh...

27:33.800 --> 27:35.484
she used to sneak
over the walls,

27:35.640 --> 27:37.608
spend time out there.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.169
You know, I don't know why.
She just wanted to.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.209
But, um...

27:43.360 --> 27:45.089
I think she went out there
after the attack.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.969
What, she's still out there?

27:47.120 --> 27:49.327
Yeah.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.205
We don't know where she is.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.966
You know, but she knows
how to take care of herself.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.882
And we can't go out there.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.849
Carl wanted to try.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.002
I stopped him.
I told him I'd tell you if he did.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.611
And then, um--
I don't know.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.807
I just thought
I should tell you--

28:05.960 --> 28:07.485
Do you know where he is now?

28:07.640 --> 28:10.450
Yeah, he's back at the house.
I saw him on the porch with Judith.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.044
I can keep guard,
if you want.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.204
Down there,
they're guarding the place now.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.170
This is just about keeping an eye out
for the others that aren't back,

28:20.320 --> 28:23.722
looking for a sign from Glenn.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.723
All right.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.850
Thank you.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.082
Um...

28:32.240 --> 28:34.561
so I was thinking about what you said
back at the quarry.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.405
And, uh, I mean,
you're right.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.325
I need to know
how to protect myself

28:40.480 --> 28:42.369
and my mom and brother.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.969
This place.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.961
So can you teach me
how to shoot?

28:50.160 --> 28:52.162
( Growling,
pounding continue )

28:59.000 --> 29:01.162
There's your target.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.607
Just relax.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.567
How is he?

29:34.120 --> 29:36.043
Ahem.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.202
What is it?

29:39.960 --> 29:41.962
It's the end of the world.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.961
No, it's not.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.887
Yeah, being afraid sucks.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.569
( Water splashing )

30:20.360 --> 30:23.603
We're still too close.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.928
We just have to get through
a few of them, then we're gone.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.650
No.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.922
You ready?

30:30.080 --> 30:31.411
No, we can't.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.006
(walkers growling )

30:34.160 --> 30:36.322
You can stay.
I'll go.

30:36.520 --> 30:37.851
No.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.321
No!

30:40.520 --> 30:42.682
- Maggie.
- It's over!

30:42.840 --> 30:44.524
(growling )

30:50.600 --> 30:53.444
I burned his last picture of him

30:53.600 --> 30:55.807
because I said I wasn't
gonna need it anymore.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.849
Because I was never gonna be
away from him again.

30:58.040 --> 31:00.361
( Snarling )

31:02.680 --> 31:04.364
I'm pregnant.

31:06.680 --> 31:09.490
He didn't want me to go out there
and I said yes.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.120
And if I would've gone...

31:12.280 --> 31:15.045
if I was with him,
maybe I could've helped him.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.129
I don't know if he's alive.

31:21.360 --> 31:24.762
He would've shown me by now.
That's what Michonne said.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.249
I just want to see his face.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.607
I can't.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.084
I don't get to know
what will happen.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.685
I won't get to know
why it happened,

31:38.840 --> 31:41.047
what I did right or wrong.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.289
Not now.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.929
I have to live with that.
You do, too.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.767
Sam, I made you
some cookies.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.445
( Door opens )

32:10.480 --> 32:12.403
Could you bring them
up here, please?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.483
No, Sam.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.281
Why?

32:21.440 --> 32:24.171
Why don't you wanna
come downstairs?

32:24.320 --> 32:26.607
I just don't wanna go down there.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.124
Why?

32:31.440 --> 32:33.488
I just...

32:38.000 --> 32:40.651
It didn't change up here.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.445
( Sighs, clears throat )

32:45.600 --> 32:49.969
Well, I'm more
than halfway up,

32:50.120 --> 32:53.090
so technically I'm upstairs.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.090
You can come here
and you won't be downstairs.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.327
No, it's okay, then.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.923
- ( Sighs )
- ( door closes )

33:34.280 --> 33:37.284
Man: I'm going to talk that way
because that's how it is!

33:37.440 --> 33:39.204
Woman: It is now, I know,
but you can't--

33:39.360 --> 33:41.010
Man: It was a lie.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.283
The fact that we're alive--
it's a joke.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.444
All this...
(voices echo, fade )

33:50.320 --> 33:51.970
( snarling )

33:52.120 --> 33:53.804
( screams )

33:56.480 --> 33:58.050
(growling )

34:02.360 --> 34:04.567
Come on,
you son of a bitch.

34:04.720 --> 34:08.281
(grunting )

34:23.719 --> 34:27.327
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( snarling stops )

34:27.480 --> 34:29.447
( panting )

34:31.400 --> 34:33.641
Rick: Carol said she got
one of them,

34:33.840 --> 34:36.002
but she couldn't find the body.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.561
He must have been under there.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.242
I want to live.

34:55.320 --> 34:59.450
I want this place to stay standing.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.443
You need to lead them.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.204
( Chuckles )

35:03.360 --> 35:04.964
They don't need me, Rick.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.410
What they need is you.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.443
What I wanted for this place,

35:40.600 --> 35:43.683
was it really
just pie in the sky?

35:48.160 --> 35:50.128
No.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.284
(walkers growling,
banging )

36:42.160 --> 36:43.889
I'll be right back.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.644
( Banging continues )

37:20.840 --> 37:22.683
When he gets back,

37:22.880 --> 37:28.205
it's worth mentioning
that Aaron, Erin,

37:28.360 --> 37:31.603
works for a boy or a girl,

37:31.760 --> 37:33.762
depending on the spelling.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.725
Just saying.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.844
( Walkers snarling )

37:56.400 --> 37:58.289
( sniffles )

37:58.440 --> 38:00.761
What?

38:00.960 --> 38:02.803
I'm your relief.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.122
I thought Carol was up.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.966
She was.
I volunteered to take her place.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.166
You know, I never got
a chance to say it, but, um...

38:28.200 --> 38:31.522
you did good with the truck,
taking out the driver.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.442
You know,
if it weren't for you,

38:35.600 --> 38:37.682
this wall might not
be standing right now.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.325
I just got lucky-

38:42.520 --> 38:44.648
Good or lucky,
it doesn't really matter.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.808
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.640
( Distant clanging )

39:28.680 --> 39:31.889
Those bodies
by the graveyard...

39:32.040 --> 39:34.884
the reason I wanted
to wait was...

39:39.040 --> 39:40.804
was Glenn.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.048
We don't know
if he's still out there.

39:46.600 --> 39:50.400
And Daryl, Sasha, Abraham,

39:50.560 --> 39:52.688
I wanted them back by now.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.488
I wanted those things gone.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.449
I just wanted to wait.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.687
You said it could go on a while.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.487
I did and it could.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.921
Rick, it already has.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.643
They could still be alive.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.928
We're not moving past that.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.923
You know, it's just--

40:26.040 --> 40:27.849
right here, in this moment...

40:29.960 --> 40:32.088
this is it,
this is what it is.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.647
"This is what life
looks like now."

40:37.920 --> 40:39.160
You heard about that?

40:44.600 --> 40:47.251
I wasn't saying
there wasn't a future.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.965
There's gotta be.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.284
Tell me there's more.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.890
- ( Walkers growling )
- ( fence rattling )

42:13.040 --> 42:16.044
( walkers snarling )

42:22.000 --> 42:25.209
( theme music playing )
