00:31.031 --> 00:33.966
Excuse me, sir. I have an appointment
with Mr. Miles Holling.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.959
No, I have an appointment.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.597
But you don't seem to understand.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.674
- All right. Go ahead.
- Thank you so much.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.810
I don't care who you are.
No one gets in without a pass.

00:43.845 --> 00:45.846
You don't understand! I was promised
I could... - Call your office.

00:45.881 --> 00:46.794
Clear.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.848
Gin.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.510
- What are you doin' this weekend?
- Same as you. Workin' here.

00:52.585 --> 00:56.385
What? - Didn't you hear?
We all have to work. They just posted it.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.857
Oh, why? - You know why.
It's the old man's birthday.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.520
Oh, and don't you forget your I. D.
Or they will not let you in.

01:02.595 --> 01:05.860
So some geezer has a birthday,
and my whole weekend's shot.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.866
Miles Holling is not just
another geezer.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.926
We are talking about
the oldest man in the world here.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.268
It's big news! Didn't you see
all those reporters out there?

01:13.339 --> 01:16.399
Well, it's not big news to me. I made
plans. My whole family's coming over.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.467
Well, maybe you'll
get lucky and he won't wake up.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.775
Oh! Wouldn't that be great.

01:41.701 --> 01:45.501
Who are you? You're not George.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.040
Where's George?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.941
Fella? You better get outta here.
What the hell are you doing?

01:51.010 --> 01:53.376
Help! Turn me loose!

02:00.991 --> 02:03.916
MONK Season 2 Epi. 5
Mr. Monk and the Very, very old man

02:57.544 --> 02:59.842
Ma'am, even if I agreed with you...

02:59.913 --> 03:03.508
I do not have the authority
to take the billboard down.

03:05.251 --> 03:09.187
Look. Have you considered taking
a different road home?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.715
You have a nice day too.

03:12.792 --> 03:16.592
Captain? - Lieutenant, why am I fielding
calls about zoning regulations?

03:16.663 --> 03:19.029
Aren't you supposed to be
protecting the quarterback?

03:19.098 --> 03:23.000
- Your wife's here.
- Okay. Okay.

03:23.069 --> 03:27.472
Uh, look, I need a few minutes.
Could you stall her? - What should I do?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.906
- Uh, talk to her.
- About what?

03:29.976 --> 03:34.640
- I mean, what does she like to talk about?
- How I ruined her life.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.916
Okay. Cigars.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.890
He'll just be a minute.
He's on a call.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.360
Hmm. So, uh, you're workin'
on a new script?

03:49.429 --> 03:52.694
I make documentary films, Lieutenant.
I don't use scripts.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.311
- The world is my script.
- Neat.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.292
Big special crystal.

03:57.370 --> 04:01.363
And the magic dream catcher.
There we go.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.409
I want to show you something.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.344
They just issued these.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.347
It's a Beretta.
Nine-millimeter Centurion.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.816
It holds 15 in the mag,
one in the chamber.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.513
Mm. You know how
I feel about guns.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.284
I know you have strong feelings.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.382
I just... can't remember
what they are.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.394
I'm against them, Lieutenant.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.056
My husband doesn't carry a weapon.
I don't know why you need to.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.531
Sh...

04:36.276 --> 04:38.938
- What's he doing in there?
- He'll just be one more minute.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.579
And the waterfall.

04:43.650 --> 04:47.279
This is the holster.
It's calfskin. It's nice.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.220
- Water.
- I'm going in.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.282
Yes, ma'am. Let me just
get the door for you.

04:52.423 --> 04:56.089
Okay. Here we go.
That's it.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.294
Hi.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.357
- Hi.
- Come on in.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.336
Hi. What a nice surprise.

05:08.841 --> 05:12.834
Oh! The waterfall.
How do you like it?

05:15.715 --> 05:17.945
It's great. I love it.

05:18.017 --> 05:22.881
- Thank you, again.
- Is it calming you down? - Yes.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.557
- Is that coffee?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.424
It's a coffeefall.

05:29.495 --> 05:33.431
- H-How was, uh, art therapy?
- Art therapy is on Wednesday.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.024
Yes, I knew that.
U-Uh...

05:36.102 --> 05:38.297
How is, uh... - Leland?

05:38.371 --> 05:42.831
- Do you remember Miles Holling?
- Yes.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.969
- No.
- The oldest man in the world?

05:46.045 --> 05:47.979
I made a film about him?

05:48.047 --> 05:52.006
It won Honorable Mention
at the Monterey Festival?

05:52.085 --> 05:55.384
Of course, you wouldn't remember.
You didn't go!

05:55.455 --> 05:58.390
Anyway. He died last night.

05:58.458 --> 06:02.121
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.
Is that why you're here?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.858
In a way. You see,
I think he was murdered.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.868
Okay. - Now, I know
it sounds crazy, but...

06:11.938 --> 06:14.907
I went to the nursing home this morning
to wish him a happy birthday, and...

06:14.974 --> 06:16.874
- they had just found him.
- Uh-huh?

06:16.943 --> 06:19.138
The coroner was there.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.578
There was something... wrong.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.411
- Uh-huh?
- You see, they said he died in bed,

06:24.484 --> 06:26.418
but Leland, he never
used the bed.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.954
He slept in a chair.
He told me he was afraid...

06:29.021 --> 06:31.251
that if he ever laid down,
he would never get up again.

06:31.324 --> 06:35.658
- Well, Karen...
- Also, they found a book on his chest.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.630
Like he'd been reading. But he couldn't
read, because he was nearly blind.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.827
So. I told the head nurse
to lock down that room.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.666
- You what?
- So that you can investigate.

06:45.738 --> 06:50.109
Karen, you can't do that.
Wh-What are you, a homicide detective?

06:50.144 --> 06:52.600
I mean...
How old was this guy?

06:52.678 --> 06:55.340
115. - 115?

06:55.415 --> 06:59.613
People that old, they die!
It's... It's like their job.

06:59.685 --> 07:02.245
Be reasonable. Who would kill
the oldest man in the world?

07:02.321 --> 07:05.313
- I mean, why would they bother?
- It's a hunch.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.724
- You get hunches all the time.
- Yeah, well,

07:08.795 --> 07:11.161
that's my job,
I'm a professional.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.031
- So you're not going to investigate?
- Look, honey. I...

07:15.101 --> 07:16.660
Once again, I'm asking
too much. Is that it?

07:16.695 --> 07:20.702
I-I don't tell you how to
make... your little movies.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.764
They're documentaries, Leland.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.329
Is this what you meant when you told Dr.

07:24.330 --> 07:26.039
Mosely you were going
to be more supportive?

07:26.112 --> 07:28.273
You promised. You swore
you were going to try!

07:28.347 --> 07:30.315
All right, look.

07:31.651 --> 07:35.143
I'll call Monk.
He's the best detective I know.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.621
And if Monk thinks there's been
foul play, I'll look into it.

07:37.690 --> 07:41.990
- Promise?
- Yes. I promise.

07:42.061 --> 07:45.292
Yes, honey. We're at
the nursing home. Monk.!

07:46.499 --> 07:50.401
- I really appreciate this.
- It's no problem. Glad to do it.

07:50.470 --> 07:54.031
Yes. Monk's here.
Look. If you don't believe me, here.

07:54.106 --> 07:57.735
Here's Sharona.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.040
Hey, Karen. How are ya doin'?

08:01.614 --> 08:04.082
- The room hasn't been touched?
- No, sir.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.744
And you were the last nurse
to see him? - Yes, sir. I was.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.151
Was the walker...

08:09.222 --> 08:11.213
right here? - Yes.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.520
Yeah?

08:13.593 --> 08:16.756
- How tall would you say he was?
- Um, about 5 foot 1.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.194
- Oh, no.
- Okay, now. He's looking around the bed.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.599
Looking at the pillowcase...

08:25.972 --> 08:27.770
Did you lower those shades?

08:27.805 --> 08:29.874
No, Mr. Holling never
liked them down.

08:29.942 --> 08:31.596
- Give me the phone
- What? Okay, wait, wait.

08:31.631 --> 08:33.537
Hold on. Here's your husband.

08:33.613 --> 08:38.277
Honey? Okay, look. The next voice you
hear is going to be Adrian Monk's, okay?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.808
And whatever he says, we're going
to accept it, right? No questions asked.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.221
Okay. Adrian Monk.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.852
- Have you studied the room?
- Yes, I have.

08:48.928 --> 08:53.456
Have you formed an opinion about
the cause of Miles Holling's death?

08:53.533 --> 08:58.095
- Yes, I have.
- And what is your opinion, Adrian Monk?

08:58.170 --> 09:00.866
He... was murdered.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.705
- He was murdered, Karen.
- I knew it!

09:07.947 --> 09:11.678
The walker... is in the middle of the room.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.844
H-How could Mr. Holling
have made it to the bed?

09:13.920 --> 09:18.220
Plus, there's no way a man
of his height...

09:18.291 --> 09:21.988
could have reached over the dresser
to pull down those shades.

09:26.599 --> 09:30.535
Sweetheart, I'm gonna strangle Monk,
and then I'll call you right back.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.398
Welcome to Malden.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.465
- How can I help you?
- Mr. Mayor.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.738
- The reason I...
- Excuse me. I'm s... I'm sorry.

09:39.812 --> 09:44.374
Uh, could we switch chairs?
It's the tassels.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.851
Uh, my chair has tassels.
A lot of tassels here.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.911
Will you stop staying "tassels"?

09:56.228 --> 09:58.958
Dennis Gammill, my deputy mayor,
has just been filling me in.

09:59.031 --> 10:02.091
Are you, uh, seriously asking us
to exhume Miles Holling?

10:02.168 --> 10:06.832
- We'd like them to do an autopsy.
- Mr. Mayor. Um,

10:06.906 --> 10:11.673
I-I wouldn't be here, if uh...
Well, if some of us didn't feel that...

10:11.744 --> 10:14.804
there was a strong case
for probable cause. - Excuse me.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.610
What? - I'm so sorry.
Could you switch with Sharona?

10:17.683 --> 10:20.243
Why? - Then she'd be next to me.

10:20.319 --> 10:24.187
- And then...
- That's fine, Monk.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.690
- He's sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.284
Why do you do this?
Just sit down!

10:31.964 --> 10:33.110
Now, Mr. Mayor, the letter that I wrote...

10:33.145 --> 10:36.731
Which, by the way, Mr. Mayor,
is not a court order.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.929
It's an unofficial request.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.565
That's true.
It's an unofficial request.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.075
We've been talking to the
coroner's office for three days now,

10:44.143 --> 10:47.112
- And they won't issue us a subpoena.
- They said it was up to you.

10:47.179 --> 10:50.114
In other words, you can say "No."
And I strongly suggest that you do.

10:50.182 --> 10:54.141
Steve, if-if they're wrong about this,

10:54.220 --> 10:57.621
when the next election rolls around,
you're gonna be a punch line around here.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.625
Mr. Mayor. I'd consider it
a personal favor.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.254
My wife, as you know, knew Mr. Holling,
and she grew very fond of him...

11:04.330 --> 11:06.821
- during the course of the documentary...
- Excuse me.

11:06.899 --> 11:11.768
I am... I'm so sorry.
This one's so slippery.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.034
You know... - Why don't you...
Just stand up just for a minute.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.974
Stand up.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.672
It's a tough call. Captain,
I'm gonna grant your request.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.772
- Thank you.
- Just one favor. Don't be wrong.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.423
Captain? - Yeah?

11:40.499 --> 11:43.229
We're 'bout finished.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.998
- If you want to accompany the body...
- Be there in a minute.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.346
I remember that case.
It was a hit-and-run, right?

11:56.415 --> 12:00.044
Yeah. Seventeen years old.

12:00.119 --> 12:04.146
- He'd been accepted to Princeton.
- I dug that hole.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.487
I'll never forget it.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.255
The ground was frozen solid.
It was like the Earth didn't want him.

12:10.262 --> 12:14.198
- Did they ever catch the son of a bitch?
- No, I never did.

12:14.266 --> 12:17.997
It was your case? - Still is.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.566
Still is.

12:38.288 --> 12:41.457
Captain.
You all right?

12:41.527 --> 12:44.018
Miles Holling was murdered.
He was suffocated.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.588
It's on the "A" list. I made you a copy
of the medical examiner's report.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.964
Karen kicked you out.

12:52.204 --> 12:55.867
- How did you know that?
- You didn't eat dinner at home.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.775
- A receipt here from Happy Burger.
- Yeah.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.507
We're having some problems.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.049
I'm gonna crash down the street
at the Red Roof Inn again.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.553
Why don't you... stay here?

13:10.602 --> 13:12.421
Look, you were there for me.

13:12.491 --> 13:15.153
When I went through my rough patch,
remember? - Yeah.

13:15.227 --> 13:18.219
Yeah, I remember your rough patch.
It lasted three and a half years.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.874
I wouldn't mind the company.
Are you sure?

13:24.909 --> 13:27.234
It's the least I can do.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.332
- I insist.
- All right. Thanks.

13:30.409 --> 13:35.039
- Uh, come help me with my bags.
- Bags? You have more than one?

13:35.114 --> 13:38.208
Yeah, I got a suit bag,
and a few things in the car.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.650
Shouldn't be more than a
few weeks. It'll be fun.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.687
We'll be roommates.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.931
I always have a glass of milk before bed.
But that's not...

13:53.999 --> 13:55.933
Shut up.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.141
Hell of a thing,
the oldest man in the world.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.885
Randy had a theory.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.820
He thinks maybe the second oldest man
in the world did it, to claim the title.

14:15.888 --> 14:19.688
- He actually looked into it.
- How did the killer get in?

14:19.758 --> 14:23.660
There's only one entrance.
You need a valid I. D. To get in.

14:23.729 --> 14:27.130
Maybe somebody on staff?
Psycho nurse?

14:28.334 --> 14:31.132
Did the old man have any money?

14:31.203 --> 14:34.297
Oh, yeah. There was a small
insurance policy, under ten grand.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.432
What are you doing, Monk?
I have a coaster.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.068
I always put another one
underneath. It's, uh...

14:39.144 --> 14:41.135
It's like a backup.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.878
- Thank you.
- Who was the beneficiary?

14:45.951 --> 14:48.476
The old man's son, Hiram Holling.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.490
- We're gonna talk to him tomorrow.
- So, what do you think?

14:52.558 --> 14:57.655
Well, why ask me?
My hippie wife's a better cop than me.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.755
- Don't say that.
- Look.

14:59.832 --> 15:03.249
I don't mind living in your shadow,
Monk. You're a freak of nature.

15:03.284 --> 15:03.775
Thank you.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.862
But when Karen sees things that I miss,

15:06.939 --> 15:09.737
I might as well just hang it up.

15:14.346 --> 15:17.281
Guess where I was today.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.408
I was at the Leveroni gravesite.

15:19.485 --> 15:23.421
- Do you remember that?
- Oh, it was a hit and run, five years ago.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.821
Seventeen years old, valedictorian.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.327
Killed three blocks from his house.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.556
I always figured
somebody would confess.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.064
Well, me too.

15:38.237 --> 15:40.705
I mean, how-how-how can somebody
live with themselves, you know?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.934
I mean, you gotta tell somebody.

15:43.008 --> 15:47.138
- The urge to confess.
- Yeah, it's the cop's best friend.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.683
- What are you doing?
- I like it like this.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.242
It's crooked. - No.

15:56.422 --> 16:00.483
Monk. The whole house
is laid out at right angles.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.960
Everything.
Except this table.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.759
Do you want to tell me why?

16:06.832 --> 16:08.697
Uh-uh.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.268
Here. I found
an alarm clock, Captain.

16:14.473 --> 16:18.910
You can stop calling me Captain.
You might have noticed I'm out of uniform.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.310
Okay, uh...

16:21.380 --> 16:23.644
Leland.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.482
Do you, Leland...
need anything else?

16:27.553 --> 16:29.544
No. I'm fine.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.753
Thank you. Good night.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.226
7:53. - Uh-huh.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.991
Why don't...
Why don't you just say 8:00?

16:42.634 --> 16:46.661
- 8:00 is too late.
- But it's a nice, round number.

16:46.739 --> 16:50.038
"Eight-oh-oh."

16:52.578 --> 16:56.275
Monk, how important is this to you?
I mean, on a scale from one to ten?

16:56.348 --> 16:59.511
I'd say it's about an eight.
Eight-oh-oh.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.179
How about 7:00?
7:00... 7:00.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.188
Seven-oh-oh.

17:04.256 --> 17:07.623
- 7:00 is too early.
- You could use the snooze alarm.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.856
Six times. - Okay!

17:10.929 --> 17:12.512
This isn't working.
I'm gonna go to the hotel.

17:12.547 --> 17:16.428
No! No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
Look, just... You can't go.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.834
You were there for me.
I owe ya. All right?

17:18.904 --> 17:21.236
I'm gonna make this work.
Okay.

17:21.306 --> 17:24.742
7:53. Odd number.
No problem.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.836
Okay? I'm an adult.
All right? Odd number? - All right.

17:27.913 --> 17:29.938
- Good night.
- No big deal. Good night.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.431
Okay. I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

17:52.504 --> 17:56.873
I'm setting the alarm to 8:00.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.638
Eight-oh-oh.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.736
Are you happy? - Yeah.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.483
Now, I'm setting the clock...

18:04.518 --> 18:07.680
Ahead seven minutes,

18:07.753 --> 18:11.883
so really, I'll be
getting up at 7:53.

18:11.957 --> 18:14.551
Now we're both happy.

18:14.626 --> 18:18.892
Yeah, but... - You come in here again,
Monk, and I'll shoot ya.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.491
Good night.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.908
Did Leland send you?

18:29.975 --> 18:33.274
No. I swear.

18:33.345 --> 18:37.549
I didn't even tell Adrian I was coming.

18:37.638 --> 18:41.849
- You okay?
- It's called Bikram Yoga.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.048
- You should try it.
- Looks pretty painful.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.718
It's supposed to be.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.227
"No pain, no gain."

18:50.295 --> 18:54.129
I have a different motto.
"No pain? What's the catch?"

18:56.301 --> 18:59.634
Um, you know, I... I hope you
don't mind that I came over here.

18:59.705 --> 19:04.404
But... Your husband
is staying over at Adrian's house.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.637
And they're driving
each other crazy.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.943
Well, tell Adrian Monk
welcome to my world.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.609
You know, neither one of them
got any sleep last night.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.016
Adrian's back at my place,
taking a nap.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.248
Sharona, I don't know what
you want me to say here. I mean,

19:17.322 --> 19:19.950
Leland is impossible...
nobody could live with him.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.858
You know, the department
has counseling services.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.897
Well, we tried therapy.
It lasted for, uh, three weeks.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.524
You see, Leland does
not respect the process.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.125
He doesn't respect me.
That's the bottom line.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.763
Karen, that is not true.
He is so proud of you.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.603
He talks about you all the time!

19:35.638 --> 19:37.832
Do you know that he still
has not seen my movie,

19:37.910 --> 19:39.844
the one that I made
about Miles Holling,

19:39.912 --> 19:43.245
and it won "Best Documentary...
Honorable Mention"?

19:43.315 --> 19:45.643
- Well, he's busy!
- It's 65 minutes long.

19:45.678 --> 19:49.310
How busy could he be? Here.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.693
Would-Would you like to see it?

19:56.762 --> 19:59.026
Sure.

19:59.097 --> 20:02.032
And I promise you,
he's gonna see it too.

20:04.236 --> 20:07.000
Last night... midnight...

20:07.072 --> 20:09.666
I get up and use the bathroom.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.732
Five minutes later, I hear him.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.744
He's in there cleaning.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.576
An hour and a half. - Geez.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.809
Kind of makes a guy
self-conscious.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.409
Well, you could stay with me, sir.

20:21.486 --> 20:26.389
I have TiVo. - No. No, I couldn't
leave now. I'd hurt his feelings.

20:26.458 --> 20:31.088
He thinks he owes me because
I held his hand when Trudy died.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.621
That's my new, full-time job.
Not hurting people's feelings.

20:35.767 --> 20:39.464
My father was 114.

20:39.538 --> 20:44.202
Now, that is old, but
it is still too young...

20:44.276 --> 20:46.437
Do you understand? - Yes, sir.

20:46.511 --> 20:50.003
If you find that bastard,
do me one favor.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.677
I want five minutes alone
with him in the room.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.845
When was the last time
you saw your father?

20:55.921 --> 20:59.755
Two months.
U-Unless you mean, on the TV.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.385
Oh, they used him a lot on the TV.

21:02.461 --> 21:06.557
He wrote a book! They even
put it in a time capsule.

21:06.632 --> 21:10.193
- Did your father have any enemies?
- No, not unless you...

21:10.269 --> 21:12.703
you're talkin' about the phone calls.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.205
- Phone calls?
- Yeah, they started about...

21:15.274 --> 21:17.139
a few weeks ago.

21:17.209 --> 21:21.236
Somebody started callin' my daddy
in the middle of the night.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.781
- At all hours.!
- What did they say?

21:24.783 --> 21:28.742
"You're a dead man.
Oh, I'm gonna kill you."

21:28.820 --> 21:34.315
- Pull the phone records.
- Oh, I do hope you find that bastard.!

21:34.393 --> 21:37.885
114.

21:37.963 --> 21:42.423
Now that's old,
but it's still... too young.

21:42.501 --> 21:47.029
You know what I mean?
He was still my daddy.

21:48.407 --> 21:53.640
And I was still his baby.

21:56.081 --> 21:59.175
Captain. I'm home.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.242
Hi.

22:04.256 --> 22:08.590
- I was just cleaning up.
- I'll-I'll do that.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.594
- I got it.
- Please. Please. Le...

22:10.662 --> 22:13.790
- I-I-I'll do it. - I got it.
- No. Please.

22:13.865 --> 22:16.891
Please. - Okay.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.061
Thanks.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.469
- How was your day?
- My day was good.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.738
I picked the boys up from school,

22:26.812 --> 22:31.010
- bought 'em some pizza...
- Oh, and how are they?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.779
- They're doin' great. Thank you.
- Good.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.683
Randy and I tracked down Hiram Holling.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.813
The old man's 83-year-old baby boy.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.050
Yeah? Anything there?

22:40.125 --> 22:43.151
Apparently, Miles Holling
was receiving phone calls last week.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.492
Late at night. Somebody
was trying to scare him.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.272
- What's that?
- Oh, new shower head.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.671
This way, we both have our own.

23:02.314 --> 23:06.648
Oh, and, uh...
Sharona gave me this.

23:09.488 --> 23:12.787
- Karen's movie.
- Sharona says...

23:12.858 --> 23:15.258
you have to watch it. - I tried.

23:15.327 --> 23:19.354
Three times. When I watch it,
all I can think of is...

23:19.431 --> 23:22.298
it cost 45 grand.

23:22.367 --> 23:25.165
It was either this or a cabin cruiser.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.298
Thirty-two foot, fiberglass.
150 horsepower.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.342
Thank you.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.844
Well, we talked about it,
and we decided to make the movie.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.039
Yeah. The table!

23:37.249 --> 23:41.117
- What is with you and that table?
- It has to be like this.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.611
- These are the phone records?
- Yeah. Yeah, we traced those.

23:45.646 --> 23:48.356
They were made from a phone
booth at the Amtrak station.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.657
- It's a bust.
- What about these?

23:50.729 --> 23:53.632
They just sent those over Employment
records from the nursing home.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.396
We got time cards
and sign-in sheets.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.402
That's strange.

23:58.470 --> 24:01.667
- What is?
- Well, this-this security guard.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.335
George Rowe.
Look at the signatures.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.344
This is Monday,
the day of the murder. - Right.

24:07.412 --> 24:10.074
These two are from last week.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.781
Yeah, that's a pretty good match.

24:11.816 --> 24:13.777
Not the handwriting.
Look at Monday.

24:13.852 --> 24:17.481
- He misspelled his name.
- Son of a bitch.

24:18.757 --> 24:20.884
How did I miss that?

24:23.328 --> 24:25.319
What is wrong with me?

24:28.333 --> 24:30.358
I should just quit.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.098
I wonder if Home Depot's hiring.

24:32.133 --> 24:35.234
- It's just a slump. It happens.
- Not to you.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.832
I didn't leave my house
for three and a half years.!

24:37.909 --> 24:39.900
The slump of the century.

24:45.717 --> 24:48.083
You know when it started?

24:48.153 --> 24:50.587
That hit and run.
The Leveroni kid.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.854
That was the case.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.594
That's when I went off the tracks. After

24:55.595 --> 24:57.554
that, I was never really
able to focus again.

24:57.629 --> 25:01.087
You know it?
Of course you know it.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.225
You know every damn thing.

25:03.301 --> 25:05.701
Mr. Rowe, open up.
It's the police.

25:10.408 --> 25:13.866
It's kinda messy in there.
Coulda been a fight.

25:13.945 --> 25:16.812
- Is that "probable cause"?
- Probably.

25:16.882 --> 25:20.181
- Probably probable cause?
- It's good enough for me.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.177
George Rowe?

25:24.689 --> 25:26.953
Hello? Police!

25:28.126 --> 25:30.117
Mister Rowe.!

25:36.668 --> 25:39.501
Monk, don't touch anything.
This isn't our house.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.596
Jesus, did I just say "our house"?

25:45.877 --> 25:48.038
Oh! - What, what, what?

25:48.113 --> 25:50.138
- What, what, what, what?
- Snake, snake, snake, on the loose.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.412
- Snake. Over there. Snake. Snake.
- All right. Okay. Okay. Easy.

25:53.485 --> 25:56.215
It's all right. - Snake on the loose.
Out of the box. Out of the box.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.223
- He's on the prowl.
- It's all right. Come on, buddy.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.089
There you go.
There you go.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.720
He's heading uptown.
He's heading uptown!

26:04.796 --> 26:07.890
- All right. Come on, guy.
- Getting away. You're losing him.

26:07.966 --> 26:10.935
- Here you go, here you go. Whoa!
- You're losing him!

26:11.002 --> 26:13.163
Shut it, shut it, shut it.
Just shut it. Shut it.

26:13.238 --> 26:17.072
Shut, shut, shut!

26:17.142 --> 26:19.872
There. Don't soil your pants.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.209
- If you do, you're on your own.
- Look at this.

26:22.280 --> 26:27.183
- What?
- "Feeding schedule: Curly, Larry, Moe."

26:28.186 --> 26:30.848
Clever.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.913
There's Curly.

26:34.159 --> 26:37.253
Larry, and...

26:41.166 --> 26:43.225
What? What? What? - Oh.

26:43.301 --> 26:45.428
- What is wrong with you?
- Where's Moe?

26:45.503 --> 26:48.097
- Who's Moe?
- Moe the snake is loose. He's missing.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.869
How do you know it's Moe?
It might be Curly. - Fine, it's Curly.!

26:50.942 --> 26:52.876
- Where the hell is Curly?
- Maybe Curly's dead.!

26:52.944 --> 26:54.288
No, no. No, no, no. No.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.812
The feeding schedule
goes up to last Friday.

26:56.881 --> 26:59.281
He's-He's-He's loose.
He's somewhere in the house.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.944
Come-Come up...Come on up here.
It's plenty strong.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.513
I'm not getting on the table
with you, Monk.

27:06.591 --> 27:09.395
- I thought you were afraid of heights.
- Snakes trump heights.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.764
It goes germs, needles, milk, death,

27:11.799 --> 27:14.799
snakes, mushrooms,
heights, crowds, elevators...

27:14.834 --> 27:18.360
Okay, I don't need the entire list.
Why don't you wait outside? Come on.

27:18.436 --> 27:21.064
- Carry me?
- What?

27:21.139 --> 27:23.164
Carry me. Please!

27:23.241 --> 27:25.038
No. No. - Please. Please.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.876
- Monk, I'm not gonna carry you.
- Okay. I'll stay here, I'm fine.

27:28.947 --> 27:30.881
Can I have your gun? - No.

27:30.949 --> 27:34.385
Not unless you plan on
using it on yourself. - Maybe I will.

27:34.452 --> 27:37.148
Ho! I found him. - Kill it! Sh...

27:37.222 --> 27:40.453
Shoot it! Kill!
Shoot! Kill it!

27:40.525 --> 27:43.255
- It's not the snake.
- Kill it.! Just shoot it.! Kill it.!

27:43.328 --> 27:45.091
I found George Rowe.

27:48.867 --> 27:52.303
Adrian? You're just sitting here.

27:52.370 --> 27:55.454
You're on the job.
Crime scene's inside.

27:55.489 --> 27:57.939
Yeah. So's Curly.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.943
Who's Curly? - The snake!

28:00.011 --> 28:03.310
Curly or Moe...
We're not sure.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.749
Hey. There's your roommate. - Yeah.

28:07.819 --> 28:11.687
- How's that workin' out?
- I'm not sleeping. I'm...

28:11.756 --> 28:15.522
I'm all stressed out.
I'm thinkin' about going to a hotel.

28:15.593 --> 28:19.222
- Why don't you?
- I don't want to hurt his feelings.

28:19.297 --> 28:21.822
Hey, Monk! We got him.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.164
He was under the couch.
Come on. I need you in there.

28:24.235 --> 28:27.966
I can't figure out if the perp and
the victim knew each other or not.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.633
Show me the snake. - What?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.007
- The bag's empty.
- No, it's not.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.069
Show me the snake.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.055
All right. The bag's empty.
Come on. I need you in there.

28:45.123 --> 28:48.650
You don't need me inside.
The killer was a stranger.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.355
He'd never-never been
in this house before.

28:51.429 --> 28:54.694
- You can tell that from here?
- He broke three panels in that door.

28:54.766 --> 28:57.701
Yeah, right. Then he reached in and
he opened the lock. What does that prove?

28:57.769 --> 29:01.637
He broke three panels.
He wasn't sure where the lock was.

29:04.109 --> 29:06.407
We're lookin' for a stranger.
Pass it on.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.447
- Yes, sir.
- What time will you be home?

29:09.514 --> 29:12.950
Huh? - What time do you think
you'll be home?

29:13.017 --> 29:16.180
I don't know. - Because I was
thinking of making a pot roast.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.052
But I need an approximate time.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.593
- I don't know, Monk. I'll call you.
- Okay. Don't forget.

29:22.660 --> 29:26.494
- I won't forget.
- That's what you said yesterday.

29:26.564 --> 29:29.431
Shut up.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.638
Good morning...

29:34.706 --> 29:36.901
Sir, are you okay?

29:39.544 --> 29:41.842
He was cleaning again.

29:41.913 --> 29:44.939
Until 3:00 a. m. - Aw, Jesus.

29:48.586 --> 29:53.319
I love my wife. I have never
loved her, or missed her more.

29:57.916 --> 29:58.930
What have you got?

29:58.965 --> 30:01.125
- Uh... Maybe this is a bad time.
- Oh, no.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.793
No, no.
I need to work.

30:05.003 --> 30:07.870
It's all I have.
What have you got? - All right.

30:07.939 --> 30:11.875
Here's the question. Who would murder
the oldest man in the world?

30:11.943 --> 30:15.640
- I know what the question is, Randy.
- Okay. Look at this.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.704
Book of World Records.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.281
Enrico Palamo. He was Italian.

30:22.353 --> 30:27.256
He collected yarn. He made
the world's biggest ball of yarn.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.555
He was murdered three years ago,
still unsolved.

30:29.627 --> 30:32.221
Well, maybe the world's
biggest kitty cat did that.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.390
I think we might have
a serial killer on our hands.

30:34.465 --> 30:38.299
- Oh, God.
- Somebody is killing world record holders.

30:38.369 --> 30:43.068
One at a time. - You think we oughta warn
the fat twins on the motorcycles?

30:43.141 --> 30:45.357
Or, wait-wait-wait...
Maybe we ought to put a 24-hour guard

30:45.392 --> 30:47.134
on the guy with the beard of bees.

30:47.212 --> 30:50.477
I can never tell
when you're being sarcastic.

30:51.649 --> 30:55.016
I'm being sarcastic, Randy.
Get the book outta here.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.554
Yes, sir.

31:23.114 --> 31:25.105
What are you doing?

31:28.353 --> 31:30.344
Monk!

31:31.356 --> 31:33.256
I just vacuumed that.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.588
I know.

31:35.660 --> 31:39.653
I'm trying to help out.
I'm trying to do my share.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.495
I know! No problem!

31:42.567 --> 31:45.968
- Finishing up.
- It's finished! The rug is clean.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.699
I know.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.037
Then what's the problem?

31:52.744 --> 31:57.875
The lines in the carpet. See?
You went on a diagonal.

31:57.949 --> 32:01.112
I like to make a grid!
It's no big deal.

32:13.164 --> 32:16.429
- You win. I give up.
- Excuse me?

32:18.369 --> 32:21.099
You know what I'm gonna do?

32:22.874 --> 32:25.536
First thing in the morning,
I'm gonna call the Vatican...

32:25.610 --> 32:29.444
and I'm gonna nominate
your late wife Trudy for sainthood!

32:29.514 --> 32:31.675
Because you are impossible!

32:31.749 --> 32:36.618
The lines!
They're all... diagonal!

32:36.688 --> 32:39.816
- I have to live here!
- Forget about the rug!

32:39.891 --> 32:44.225
This is not about the rug!

32:44.295 --> 32:47.355
Do you know what you are?
Do you know what you are?

32:47.432 --> 32:50.299
You're the world's best
marriage counselor.

32:50.368 --> 32:52.996
You could save
every marriage in California!

32:53.071 --> 32:56.666
All people have to do
is live with you for two days!

32:56.741 --> 32:59.923
Two days! And they'd never
complain about their spouse again.

32:59.958 --> 33:01.007
What are you... What are you doing?

33:01.079 --> 33:05.641
I am going home! I am gonna
beg Karen to take me back.

33:05.717 --> 33:09.050
I'm gonna beg her to take me back.
I'm gonna tell her I am a different man,

33:09.120 --> 33:11.486
and I will not be lying.

33:11.556 --> 33:14.889
She won't take you back.
You haven't seen her movie yet.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.422
When I am dead,

33:20.498 --> 33:22.728
my dearest,

33:22.800 --> 33:26.566
sing no sad songs for me.

33:26.637 --> 33:30.095
Plant thou no roses at my head,

33:30.174 --> 33:32.802
And if thou wilt, remember,

33:32.877 --> 33:36.438
And if thou wilt, forget.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.215
How are you feeling today, Miles?

33:46.290 --> 33:51.159
Not bad for an old bastard.
Next week, I'll be 110 years old.

33:51.229 --> 33:55.757
I'm the oldest man in the world.
That means I win.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.667
I don't know what I win...but I win.

34:04.311 --> 34:07.278
This time capsule is
a message in a bottle

34:07.313 --> 34:12.773
A big, metallic, vacuum-packed bottle
for our children's children's children.

34:12.850 --> 34:16.752
Oh, I see our guest of honor is arriving.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.076
One hundred years from now,

34:18.110 --> 34:21.451
future generations will read
copies of the Malden Gazette.

34:22.693 --> 34:26.857
Oh. Aw, wait.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.449
I've written a letter
to future generations,

34:28.484 --> 34:31.129
and I've asked my family
and staff to do the same.

34:31.202 --> 34:33.762
Why don't we drop them in now?

34:33.838 --> 34:35.715
And finally, I have asked
Malden's most famous resident...

34:35.750 --> 34:37.208
Where's the remote? Give it to me.

34:37.243 --> 34:40.178
Miles Holling, to write his life story.

34:40.213 --> 34:43.581
I'm going to include a copy of it.
And I make you this promise:

34:43.616 --> 34:46.083
If you live another five years,
and I'm still in office,

34:46.119 --> 34:49.451
we're gonna dig this baby up and
add another chapter to your book.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.851
- What do you think? See you in five years?
- It's a date!

34:55.626 --> 34:58.652
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

34:58.729 --> 35:02.631
You're rewinding?
We were almost done!

35:07.171 --> 35:10.299
What do you think?
See you in five years? - It's a date.

35:10.374 --> 35:14.071
Monk, I'm gonna say something
I've wanted to say for a long time.

35:14.145 --> 35:17.444
What is it?

35:17.515 --> 35:19.506
I just solved the case.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.788
Hi, hello again.
The mayor will be right with you.

35:24.856 --> 35:27.654
Actually, Dennis,
we came to talk to you.

35:27.725 --> 35:31.058
Oh? - On December 10, 1998,

35:31.129 --> 35:33.927
the day that they buried
the time capsule,

35:33.998 --> 35:35.795
you were driving
a rental car, weren't you?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.926
Mm-hmm. - I think that's strange.

35:38.002 --> 35:39.423
You driving a rental car
in your own town.

35:39.458 --> 35:41.096
Oh, well, it was a special occasion.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.504
I wanted to arrive in something nice...
what's this about?

35:43.574 --> 35:46.407
It's about Darren Leveroni.
Do you remember him?

35:46.477 --> 35:48.274
Oh. Oh, yeah. Of course I do.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.943
Your car, the one you
didn't drive that day,

35:50.978 --> 35:53.750
was it a sky-blue
Oldsmobile Cutlass sedan?

35:53.818 --> 35:56.514
Oh. Well, that was a long time ago.
Uh, I think so.

35:56.587 --> 36:00.614
A witness saw a blue Oldsmobile
leaving the scene of the hit-and-run.

36:00.691 --> 36:04.320
Now, I remember. I requested a list
of registered owners from the D. M. V.

36:04.395 --> 36:07.364
That list came through your office,
but your name wasn't on it.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.662
- Can you explain that, sir?
- I don't know.

36:10.735 --> 36:14.364
- Oversight? Clerical error?
- Where is that car today, Mr. Gammill?

36:14.438 --> 36:18.067
- It was stolen. I reported it.
- Pretty convenient.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.610
A short time later you joined
Alcoholics Anonymous, didn't you?

36:20.678 --> 36:21.695
I can't believe this!

36:21.730 --> 36:23.112
I can't believe it either.
I can't believe I missed it.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.342
Do you have a warrant? - No.

36:25.416 --> 36:28.408
I didn't think so. You can't
prove any of this, can you?

36:28.486 --> 36:31.182
I'm not sayin' another word. Here.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.587
It's my lawyer. Talk to him.

36:33.658 --> 36:37.992
- Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?
- Nothing. Nothing. They were just leaving.

36:39.197 --> 36:43.293
- This isn't over.
- Bye-bye.

36:49.907 --> 36:52.569
What?

36:56.948 --> 37:00.679
Hi! Excuse me. You remember us.

37:00.751 --> 37:02.651
- What the hell do you want?
- Did you forget something?

37:02.720 --> 37:06.656
- Yes. I did. What happened to your wrist?
- What?

37:08.893 --> 37:11.361
Looks like a snakebite.

37:11.429 --> 37:14.523
There was a snake loose
when the security guard was killed.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.567
Good old Curly. - Or Moe.

37:16.634 --> 37:19.330
- It could have been Moe.
- Oh, th-this is insane.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.462
F-First you accuse me of
a five-year-old hit-and-run.

37:21.539 --> 37:24.007
Now, I gather, you're saying
I killed some security guard.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.872
Well, make up your mind,
boys, which is it?

37:25.943 --> 37:29.379
Both, actually. Mr. Mayor, uh, we...

37:29.447 --> 37:32.041
We would like your permission
to dig up the time capsule.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.584
- Dig up the what?
- The-The time capsule...

37:34.652 --> 37:37.177
that you buried five years ago.

37:37.255 --> 37:40.554
- We need to take a look inside.
- Oh, Jesus.

37:40.625 --> 37:44.288
Why? What, first the old man,
now the time capsule? What?

37:44.362 --> 37:46.193
Y-You plan on diggin' up
the whole county?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.926
Steve, they don't have the authority.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.128
That's true. But I do.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.776
They were right about
Miles Holling being murdered.

37:53.811 --> 37:56.003
I'm inclined to give
them the benefit of the doubt.

37:56.073 --> 37:58.371
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you.

38:03.814 --> 38:04.979
You can't keep me here.

38:05.014 --> 38:07.306
You're the primary suspect
in two homicides.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.216
We can detain you briefly.

38:10.688 --> 38:11.767
What do you think you're going to prove?

38:11.802 --> 38:15.148
First, we're gonna prove that you killed
George Rowe to get his security pass.

38:15.226 --> 38:19.094
- His security pass? - You needed
it to get into the nursing home,

38:19.163 --> 38:21.529
- in order to kill Miles Holling.
- Steve.

38:21.599 --> 38:23.430
No, no, no.
Care to tell me why?

38:23.501 --> 38:28.200
Because of something you said,
Mr. Mayor, five years ago.

38:28.272 --> 38:31.070
It was in Karen Stottlemeyer's
movie, which...

38:31.142 --> 38:32.939
which I thoroughly enjoyed,
by the way.

38:33.010 --> 38:36.241
Yeah. Me too.
I watched the whole thing.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.581
When you buried the capsule, you made
a promise to Miles Holling. Remember?

38:41.652 --> 38:44.348
You said that if he lived
another five years,

38:44.422 --> 38:46.176
that you'd dig it up again,

38:46.211 --> 38:49.792
so that he could add
a final chapter to his autobiography.

38:49.860 --> 38:50.831
That's right. I did.

38:50.866 --> 38:53.626
If Miles turned 115,
they would have dug it up.

38:53.698 --> 38:57.361
And in your paranoia, you couldn't
risk that happening, could you?

38:57.435 --> 38:59.903
So you tried to scare
the old man to death.

38:59.970 --> 39:03.303
Late night phone calls, death threats.

39:03.374 --> 39:06.866
When that didn't work,
you realized you had no choice.

39:06.944 --> 39:09.538
You had to kill him.

39:09.613 --> 39:10.714
There's something in there.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.777
Something you thought
no one would see for 100 years.

39:13.851 --> 39:17.719
I've written a letter
to future generations,

39:17.788 --> 39:20.154
and I've asked my family and staff
to do the same.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.124
Why don't we drop them in now?

39:32.069 --> 39:36.301
The mayor invited his family
and staff members...

39:36.374 --> 39:38.968
to add a personal note.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.511
Let's take a look...

39:43.347 --> 39:46.009
at what Mr. Gammill wrote.

39:46.083 --> 39:47.880
Captain?
Would you mind reading it?

40:00.331 --> 40:05.234
"On December 2, 1998,
I killed Darren Leveroni with my car.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.905
"May God forgive me, because
I will never forgive myself.

40:10.975 --> 40:13.705
Signed, Dennis Gammill."

40:15.646 --> 40:18.672
- The urge to confess.
- It's a cop's best friend.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.731
Steve, please.
How long have you known me?

40:20.766 --> 40:22.119
I don't know you at all.

40:22.154 --> 40:25.520
It was an accident! I swear!

40:26.657 --> 40:29.217
I was drinking!

40:29.293 --> 40:32.421
I don't remember hitting anybody.
I woke up...

40:32.496 --> 40:38.093
and the-the fender was dented and
there was some blood and some hair.

40:38.169 --> 40:41.866
And... I thought I hit an animal.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.971
I prayed to God I hit an animal.

40:46.043 --> 40:48.307
Lieutenant, take him away.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.504
Yes, sir.

40:54.919 --> 40:58.912
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Captain. Captain!

40:58.989 --> 41:01.480
This was in there too.

41:18.108 --> 41:22.204
Did you write that? - Well.

41:22.279 --> 41:26.648
You weren't supposed to read it.
At least, not for 100 years.

41:34.391 --> 41:36.382
Is it about me?

41:38.195 --> 41:41.756
What do you think?

41:41.832 --> 41:44.801
Did you really like my movie?

41:50.274 --> 41:52.970
Yeah. Two thumbs up.

41:55.212 --> 41:57.009
Though I'm not an objective critic.

41:57.081 --> 42:00.107
Because I'm insanely in love
with the filmmaker.

42:16.433 --> 42:19.402
Monk. Looks like
you're on your own again.

42:19.470 --> 42:22.956
- Glad to hear it.
- Thank you for looking after him.

42:22.991 --> 42:23.998
And-And thank you.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.372
- You're welcome.
- It was my pleasure.

42:26.443 --> 42:28.638
- No, it wasn't.
- No, it wasn't.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.875
I took the liberty of
packin' up your things,

42:31.949 --> 42:34.076
puttin' them in your car.

42:39.356 --> 42:42.348
Let's not do this again
real soon, okay? - You got it.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.632
It's great. It's great.

43:13.991 --> 43:16.516
- Are you tired?
- Mm-hmm.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.585
Come here.
