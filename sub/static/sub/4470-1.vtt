00:17.685 --> 00:21.303
A new school year, Blanche. A new era.

00:21.397 --> 00:23.934
If the Russians can put a man in space,

00:24.024 --> 00:29.610
just imagine what our
young American minds can do at Rydell.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.756
This is going to be
a wonderful year, Blanche.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.637
Wonderful.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.637
-Miss McGee!
-Blanchel

01:01.812 --> 01:05.100
Spendin’ my vacation in the summer sun

01:05.190 --> 01:08.307
Gettin’ lots of action and lots of fun

01:08.402 --> 01:11.610
Scorin’ like a bandit
till the bubble burst

01:11.697 --> 01:15.064
Suddenly it got to be September 1st

01:15.159 --> 01:17.616
Woe is me

01:18.620 --> 01:21.578
All summer long / was happy and free

01:21.790 --> 01:25.078
Save my soul

01:25.169 --> 01:27.706
The board of education
took away my parole

01:27.963 --> 01:34.505
I gotta go back, back
Back to school again

01:35.095 --> 01:38.428
You won ’t ﬁnd me
till the clock strikes 3:00

01:38.515 --> 01:41.222
I’m gonna be there till then

01:41.310 --> 01:47.727
I gotta go back, back
Back to school again

01:48.567 --> 01:55.359
Whoa, whoa, lgotta go
Back to school again

01:55.741 --> 01:57.197
She's late again.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.024
Personally, lthink that
being late demonstrates

01:59.119 --> 02:01.326
terrible leadership qualities.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.499
Well, I'm not waiting anymore.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.743
-Here she is.
-We||!

02:05.876 --> 02:08.162
We're gonna be late. Let's go.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.971
Geometry and History is just a pain

02:25.062 --> 02:28.395
Biology and Chemistry destroys my brain

02:28.482 --> 02:31.690
Well, don ’t they know
that I deserve a better fate?

02:31.777 --> 02:34.644
I’m really much too young to matriculate

02:34.738 --> 02:38.356
Well, Mama, please

02:38.450 --> 02:41.738
Your child’s come down
with a fatal disease

02:41.829 --> 02:47.950
Mama said, "Come on, you lazy bum
and get your butt out of bed

02:48.043 --> 02:53.834
"You gotta go back, back
Back to school again

02:55.300 --> 02:58.417
"It’s bye-bye, fun
Get your homework done

02:58.512 --> 03:01.424
"lt better be in by 10:00"

03:01.515 --> 03:07.055
I gotta go back, back
Back to school again

03:08.605 --> 03:11.472
Whoa, whoa, lgotta go

03:11.859 --> 03:15.852
Back to school again

03:16.488 --> 03:19.651
Senior year, the home stretch.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.733
My old man wants me
to go to junior college after grad.

03:22.828 --> 03:26.537
-Yeah? Nerd junior college.
-Hey, what are you gonna do, Johnny?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.120
Sleep.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.416
Nah. I mean, what are you gonna be
when you grow up?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.368
A burden on society.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.716
-Hello, Miss Mason.
-Hello, girls.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.301
Ready for a great new year?

03:42.347 --> 03:43.553
I love your hair, Miss Mason.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.215
Thanks.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.222
All 300 pounds of it.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.180
-Hello, boys.
-Good morning, Miss Mason.

03:53.275 --> 03:57.234
I would really love to see all of you
in Music Appreciation this year, okay?

03:57.487 --> 04:00.399
I'd like to see all of you
in Music Appreciation this year.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.317
You just might.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.406
I think I'm in love.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.415
My hair.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.254
-Excuse me. Let me through, please.
-What are you doing?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.221
-Hey, hey.
-Watch it!

04:28.185 --> 04:29.174
Nerd.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.191
-Michael?
-Frenchy?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.949
-Hi.
-Hello. Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.664
Listen, when your cousin Sandy told me
you were coming to school in America,

04:49.748 --> 04:52.956
I said, "Sandy, any cousin of yours
is a cousin of mine."

04:53.043 --> 04:55.750
Yes, she did say you're the one
who'd know the ropes around here.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.668
Ropes are my specialty.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.087
See, | used to go to Rydell

04:59.174 --> 05:01.039
before I dropped out
to go to beauty school,

05:01.134 --> 05:04.046
but then, I flunked tinting
when my hair turned pink.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.422
Pink?

05:06.139 --> 05:09.302
The Pink Ladies pledge to act cool

05:09.393 --> 05:12.510
To look cool and to be cool

05:12.646 --> 05:15.979
Till death do us part, think Pink!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.437
Hi, guys.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.812
Your mother.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.243
But now the most important thing
in my life is skin care.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.741
So tinting's out and skin care's in.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.323
Right. That's why I'm back at Rydell.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.876
To get my Chemistry
so I can mix my own cosmetics.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.169
Makes sense.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.915
I got my books together
and I dragged my feet

05:43.010 --> 05:46.127
And then / saw this angel
Boppin’ down the street

05:46.221 --> 05:49.554
lsaid, "Hey, pretty baby,
how’s about a date?"

05:49.641 --> 05:53.099
She said, "I’m goin’ to school
and I can’t be late... "

05:53.186 --> 05:54.175
Hey, basketball.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.978
Hey, you caught it.
How tall are you? Never mind.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.442
We'll put high heels on your sneakers
and we'll make you center.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.063
Hey, yeah? Go catch that. Oh, boy!

06:02.154 --> 06:03.439
Basketball, basketball, basketball.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.667
/ gotta go

06:21.423 --> 06:23.880
I gotta go back to school...

06:24.468 --> 06:26.675
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Give it back. Come on, give it back.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.127
Hey, have a nice trip.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.113
Yeah.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.579
Hold it, Birds.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.916
Comb.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.631
Door

07:10.347 --> 07:11.837
-Come on, we're late.
-Make way.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.929
Gentlemen, start your engines.

07:19.356 --> 07:25.818
I gotta go back, back
Back to school again

07:28.198 --> 07:29.779
/ gotta go

07:29.866 --> 07:33.108
Back to school...

07:35.413 --> 07:38.155
You're going to love Rydell.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.791
Again!

07:55.725 --> 07:57.977
From the front, this is a perfect nose.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.803
From the side,
this nose does not belong on this face.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.762
So dump the face and keep the nose.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.517
-What's the new look, Sharon?
-Jackie Kennedy.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.567
-It only landed her a president.
-Yeah?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.691
Well, the magazines say that JFK

08:10.782 --> 08:13.694
secretly prefers
the Marilyn Monroe look.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.283
-Hi, Johnny.
-Yeah?

08:15.912 --> 08:18.244
I really like your hair in the back.
It's really cool.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.787
Thanks.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.912
I still see you giving lube jobs
at the old man's service station.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.540
-Stuff it, Goose.
-So, what's the story, Stephanie?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.495
Yeah, what's the story?

08:27.966 --> 08:29.331
Sorry.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.337
You know the story, Johnny. It's over.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.460
Yeah? Yeah?

08:34.097 --> 08:35.428
Well, that's not good enough.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.466
-Don't make a scene, okay?
-What? There's no scene.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.176
-Hey, Johnny.
-Hey, what's the scene?

08:41.271 --> 08:43.887
-There's no scene, all right?
-Sorry.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.484
-Hi, Louis.
-Hello to you.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.698
What's this?
The Vince Fontaine National Library?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.775
Quiet, please.

08:56.870 --> 09:01.113
Laugh, you jerks, but just wait till
I turn up on National Bandstand.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.948
Yeah, you may turn up on the Bandstand,

09:03.043 --> 09:05.705
but your beak
will still be turning down.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.124
-You're mean.
-I gotta do it.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.879
The nose goes. Bandstand, here I come.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.673
Rhonda, I wouldn't fool around
with Mother Nature if I were you.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.595
You fooled around with
everyone else, Paulette.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.797
Shut up.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.935
Meet me at the homeroom.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.135
Fashionista. Pants.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.640
-Hi, Paulette.
-Hi, Willie.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.141
Hey, Frenchy.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.474
Excuse me.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.324
How long have you been in America?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.905
Just about a week.
I'm staying with my aunt and uncle.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.872
These are the lockers.
Take a locker and lock it.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.997
Yeah. Because these guys
will steal every thing.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.494
Thanks.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.002
What do you think you're doing?

09:53.093 --> 09:55.049
l was just putting a few things
in my locker.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.125
His locker!

09:56.221 --> 09:57.506
Excuse us.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.888
No one touches these lockers, okay, pal?

10:00.976 --> 10:03.388
What's the matter, you can't read that
that spells T-Bird?

10:03.478 --> 10:04.638
Which spells us.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.722
-And this is a protected landmark.
-A slice of American history.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.236
-Dig?
-I think I understand.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.440
Good. A real Einstein.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.577
By the way,
my name's Michael Carrington.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.655
I'm the Duke of Earl.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.126
Well, this is your new locker,
Shakespeare.

10:27.919 --> 10:31.127
-A perfect fit.
-We're being invaded by foreigners.

10:31.214 --> 10:34.251
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, fine, thanks.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.672
-Don't let these guys bug you.
-I won't, don't worry.

10:44.185 --> 10:49.771
-When are you guys going to grow up?
-Look, the nerd invaded our sacred turf.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.440
Hey, come on, I wanna talk to you.
Meet me for a smoke after class.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.143
I quit. It's bad for your health.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.522
Yeah? Well, standing me up is also bad.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.696
Says who?

10:59.784 --> 11:02.526
Says the Sturgeon General
of the United States, Stephanie.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.457
All right, all right,
everyone please take a seat.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.796
I got mine.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.247
You loved it.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.010
God, watch the nose.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.689
"Good morning, Rydell,

11:33.777 --> 11:36.814
"and welcome one and all
to a new school year.

11:36.905 --> 11:42.025
"I know this is going to be an exciting
and stimulating year for all of us.

11:42.327 --> 11:46.616
"First, I’d like to extend
a welcome back to our own Mr. Spears,

11:46.706 --> 11:51.075
"who made such a miraculous recovery
from the mental exhaustion

11:51.544 --> 11:54.286
"which sent him
to the hospital last spring.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.088
"Welcome back, Mr. Spears.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.211
"We’re all rooting for you.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.424
"Now, Rydell is very proud
of her extra-curricular activities,

12:07.519 --> 12:10.682
"so please come out for band try-outs.

12:10.939 --> 12:15.933
"If you play an instrument, it’s better
to play with a group than with yourself.

12:18.279 --> 12:23.023
"Auditions for the June Moon Talent Show
will be held next month.

12:23.284 --> 12:29.405
"Come out one and all.
You could win 100 long-playing records.

12:29.499 --> 12:34.334
"Last but not least, we are fortunate
to have a straight-'A' student

12:34.421 --> 12:38.835
"all the way from England,
by the name of Michael Carrington. "

12:39.092 --> 12:40.582
Stand up, Michael.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.431
All right, now, let's all say
hello to Michael Carrington.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.139
Hello, Michael Carrington.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.440
Let's have a wonderful year.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.433
Rydell High, beat the Cavaliers!

12:58.695 --> 13:01.937
Rydell High, beat the Cavaliers!

13:04.033 --> 13:06.069
So, what's the story
with you and Johnny?

13:06.161 --> 13:08.493
Let's just say
| outgrew him over the summer.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.912
Yeah, well, he hasn't
lost the hots for you.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.706
Johnnyjust hasn't learned
when you're dead, lie down.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.330
Besides, there's gotta be more to life
than making out.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.286
You know,
I never thought of it that way.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.166
Michael.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.514
Michael.

13:30.059 --> 13:34.223
-I heard you know how to play the piano.
-Yeah. Well, I can a bit.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.980
Then you must play
for the talent show audition.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.977
I will not take no for an answer.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.308
Michael.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.019
Well?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.942
Okay, I'll do it. Why not?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.233
I think he's kinda cute.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.903
-Virgin alert! Virgin alert!
-All male periscopes down.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.042
-So, how's your first week been?
-Great. Yours?

13:58.213 --> 14:01.250
Listen, there is such a fascinating
world of chemistry out there.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.922
Yeah, I know.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.751
Hey, how well do you know
that Stephanie Zinone?

14:07.222 --> 14:10.589
Stephanie Zinone
is one of my very best...

14:12.018 --> 14:15.101
Michael, I think there's something
you don't understand.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.304
See, Stephanie Zinone is a Pink Lady.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.935
Which means if you're not a T-Bird,
which you are not,

14:20.026 --> 14:22.563
you can look, but don't touch...

14:23.530 --> 14:26.647
Michael, I wouldn't even look.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.527
Well, then how do you
become one of these T-Birds then?

14:35.750 --> 14:36.739
Well...

14:36.834 --> 14:40.668
Like I told you before,
football is like life, you gotta push.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.667
You gotta push your way through life,
you gotta push and elbow. Come on.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.623
Push. I want you to push those men
out of the way.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.465
Elbow 'em, then bite 'em,
then rip 'em, then chew 'em up.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.178
Come on, push, push, push!

14:51.724 --> 14:53.385
Push,push!

14:53.810 --> 14:57.348
Attaboys! Pin 'em up. Chew 'em up.
Come on, come on! Don't you have any...

14:57.689 --> 14:59.554
Come on. You're a bunch of old turkeys.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.560
Come on, don't you know you gotta push?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.568
You said push.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.576
Check this out.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.033
What are they doing here?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.557
-Nogerelli.
-Balmudo.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.930
These cockroaches are gonna
invade our turf one time too many.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.481
We should take care of them tonight.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.900
Tonight, we bowl.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.784
Hey, you're lucky.
We're bowling tonight.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.529
I like that.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.374
You'd better write your will, boys.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.591
-Hey, baby, check your oil for you?
-Hi, hot stuff.

16:21.606 --> 16:25.770
-Hey, are we bowling tonight?
-That's right.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.605
-And Paulette...
-Yeah, Johnny.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.403
I want you to look special, dig?

16:31.783 --> 16:32.772
No problem.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.251
Go, go...

16:59.185 --> 17:02.052
-Hey, Johnny.
-Yeah, Johnny.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.762
Way to go, Johnny.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.142
Hey, hey, hey, Paulette,
do not mess the hair.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.599
I'm sorry.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.936
-Hey, Paulette. Whose side are you on?
-Our side.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.232
Then don't fraternize with the enemy.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.407
Mark that a strike.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.736
What are you talking about?
You hit two lousy pins.

17:19.914 --> 17:23.247
That is a technical strike due to
the fact that these chicks were late.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.619
Read your bowling rules!

17:24.711 --> 17:26.326
-That's right. Read 'em and weep.
-Yeah.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.036
That's not fair.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.498
-This bra's killing me.
-You wish.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.423
Paulette, you gotta
put your fingers in the holes.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.800
I'm not breaking my nails.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.978
You got something going with Paulette?

17:46.899 --> 17:50.232
Well, let's say,
I'm giving her therapy for her disease.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.399
What disease?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.573
Nymphoidmania.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.365
Yeah.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.838
-What's the final score?
-Final score happens later tonight.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.757
Last game coming up,
winner take all. Agreed?

18:15.178 --> 18:16.793
-Just shoot the ball!
-Shoot the ball!

18:16.888 --> 18:18.219
Shoot the ball!

when asking for a game.

22:23.843 --> 22:29.930
"Hi, want a game?
Howdy, fellas, let's bowl some balls.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.839
"Bowling, anyone?"

22:45.406 --> 22:50.275
-Another well-deserved victory, Johnny?
-Yeah, but where's the trophy?

22:52.038 --> 22:53.869
Right here, Johnny.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.163
Kissies.

23:05.843 --> 23:08.175
That's for best average.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.554
Now what about for best score?

23:11.640 --> 23:13.380
-God.
-Touchy.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.887
What about the trophy
for best score, Stephanie?

23:16.270 --> 23:18.056
I ain't no one's trophy, Goose.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.974
She ain't no one's trophy.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.522
So that's the way it's gonna be now,
Miss Independent?

23:26.864 --> 23:30.152
Yeah, independent.
I kiss who lwant, when lwant.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.524
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.361
I could kiss the next guy
who walks through that door if I want.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.740
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.406
Be my guest.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.102
Let's eat.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.775
| vote for pizza.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.944
You vote for bed. lt's past 10:00.

24:09.031 --> 24:11.738
Why don't you just go home
and leave me alone.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.660
Bed stinks.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.785
-Hi. Is it too late to join the game?
-You want something?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.367
-Food.
-Food.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.292
-Food.
-Food.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.433
-Life stinks.
-Are you talking to me?

24:40.104 --> 24:42.311
-Yeah, you'll do.
-Great.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.435
The name's Michael. Michael Carrington.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.233
The name's Dolores. Dolores Rebchuck.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.904
Some jerks call me Woodchuck or Upchuck,
but I prefer Dolores.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.652
-Got it?
-Got it.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.154
They think they're so cool
just 'cause they got wheels.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.951
Dolores, go home.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.118
Yeah, well, looks like
you and me don't make the grade.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.866
Yeah, with them it's all these

25:03.961 --> 25:06.543
weird codes, and rules,
and pledges about cycles.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.167
You gotta be a biker
or a biker's old lady.

25:09.258 --> 25:12.000
But without a cycle, forget it.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.086
-Pisses me off.
-We're both in the same boat.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.797
I sure can't afford a cycle
without a job.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.925
Yeah, but me, I'm willing to negotiate.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.636
I offered to be a Pink Lady mascot.

25:23.731 --> 25:26.393
It ain't the coolestjob,
but it's a start.

25:26.609 --> 25:27.894
Think they'd listen?

25:27.985 --> 25:30.818
Forget it. Pisses me off.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.279
Well, it's pretty late.
I think I'd better walk you home.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.237
I don't need a babysitter, okay?

25:37.661 --> 25:40.243
Why don't you think of it as a date,
okay?

25:40.998 --> 25:44.206
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

25:44.293 --> 25:46.579
Come on. You know,
when I'm in the 12th grade,

25:46.670 --> 25:48.376
I know I'm gonna be
the head of the Pink Ladies.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.922
My Pink Ladies will rule the school.
They'll be the best.

25:52.009 --> 25:54.045
We'll have the best-looking jackets.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.627
I once tried to put letters
on this jacket, you know.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.804
Didn't work. They fell right off.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.006
It was really embarrassing

26:00.100 --> 26:02.261
'cause it happened
in front of my sister Paulette.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.435
I didn't mean for it to happen,
but it did.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.729
-Good morning, Mr...
-Stuart.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.658
-God, you could've killed us, Rhonda.
-Good move, Rhonda.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.905
-Can you imagine dying a virgin?
-God.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.086
-Nosebleed.
-Nurse, room 11.

26:31.173 --> 26:34.461
Good morning, my name is Stuart,
I'm a substitute for Mr...

26:34.551 --> 26:35.927
Good morning, Miss McGee.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.256
Good morning, Miss...

26:39.098 --> 26:41.180
-Miss? Mason.
-Mason.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.550
-This is Mr... Mr. Stuart.
-Mr. Stuart.

26:44.895 --> 26:48.262
-Mr. Stuart.
-I love your hair, Miss Mason.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.477
Thank you, Mr. Stuart.

26:51.068 --> 26:54.435
Miss Mason will help you
while you're learning the ropes.

26:54.530 --> 26:58.773
-And it would be my pleasure, I'm sure.
-l'm sure you're sure.

26:59.451 --> 27:03.194
-l'm a substitute for Mr...
-Spears.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.242
Follow me.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.004
That's why we are gonna
win this talent show.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.298
One hundred long-playing albumens.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.091
But we got zero talent.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.716
Jeez, there must be
10 Roy Orbisons there.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.546
The greatest hits of Beethoven?

27:28.230 --> 27:34.271
Good morning. My name is Mr. Stuart
and I'm your substitute teacher.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.328
-Let's all have a cigarette.
-Yeah.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.074
Mr. Nogerelli.
I've been looking for you.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.920
Hello, Miss McGee.
You're looking lovely today.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.665
There has been a rumor, Mr. Nogerelli,

27:57.760 --> 28:01.173
that motorcycles have been
driven across our school lawn.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.473
Now, I know that
couldn't have been you, Mr. Nogerelli.

28:06.894 --> 28:11.479
I'm sure you have more respect
for grass than that. Right?

28:13.192 --> 28:17.151
Now hear this. No more!
Is that understood?

28:18.739 --> 28:19.899
Good.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.065
Do you smell something burning?

28:25.412 --> 28:27.368
Mr. Nogerelli...

28:28.290 --> 28:30.622
I guess you sure told her, Johnny?

28:32.419 --> 28:35.001
-Water.
-Sorry, I'm sorry, Johnny. I'm sorry.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.415
lWill kill you!

28:36.924 --> 28:39.006
-Okay, Michael, we're ready.
-Good luck, girls.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.004
The first day of try-outs
and we're the first.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.760
I hope I don't blank out. Now.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.182
His loafers were Weejuns

28:57.361 --> 28:59.898
His chinos were black

29:01.240 --> 29:04.277
With a cute little buckle

29:05.369 --> 29:07.735
That fastened in back

29:08.539 --> 29:12.748
These are my girls.
There's some good breeding up there.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.414
And that is so important.

29:19.633 --> 29:22.841
-Hey, what's happening?
-Hey, Woodchuck.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.761
Dolores, all right? What's happening?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.464
Brad.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.383
Does this song stink, or what?

29:33.313 --> 29:36.476
Don ’t know what possessed me

29:37.109 --> 29:39.771
But / gave him my address

29:40.237 --> 29:43.980
And my heart shook with fear

29:44.158 --> 29:46.945
As I prayed that I’d hear

29:48.120 --> 29:50.452
From Brad

29:50.622 --> 29:53.580
Hear from Brad

29:53.750 --> 29:55.081
There's 100 LPs at stake here

29:55.169 --> 29:58.252
and I won't let a little hard work
come between me and the prize.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.212
We're calendar girls.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.462
You have to get into your seasons,
become your season.

30:03.552 --> 30:07.591
Rhonda, you're fall.
Give me maturity, give me aging...

30:07.681 --> 30:09.672
-Give me a break.
-Lunchtime.

30:12.186 --> 30:16.054
Then at yesterday’s tea dance

30:16.148 --> 30:20.187
My day turned to night

30:20.277 --> 30:26.273
Muffy Rogers was wearing Brad’s pin

30:26.742 --> 30:28.698
I could just die

30:29.036 --> 30:31.743
Thank you, but we haven't got all day.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.621
-But these are my girls.
-I know, dear.

30:35.083 --> 30:39.372
-Next.
-Okay, okay, we're almost ready.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.542
Okay, listen, I want everybody
to sing their...

30:43.592 --> 30:45.878
-Would you take your music. Here.
-Let me out of this zoo.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.220
-l'm going for a smoke.
-Do l have to do everything myself?

30:47.304 --> 30:48.669
-Watch out, Chuck.
-Are you ready?

31:00.067 --> 31:03.275
I’ll be your girl for all seasons

31:03.445 --> 31:06.733
All the year through, your girl for...

31:06.865 --> 31:08.526
-Hello.
-Hi.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.824
I wanted to ask if you're free
after school today.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.443
Yeah, I'm free every day.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.156
It's in the Constitution.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.536
-Okay, we're ready now.
-"Sharon Cooper and the Seasons."

31:21.755 --> 31:26.499
If you fall in the fall you’ll see

31:27.219 --> 31:31.679
September can be heavenly

31:33.850 --> 31:35.886
Eugene, ready with the leaves
when l yell?

31:35.978 --> 31:36.967
Ready.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.019
When autumn leaves
are falling from the tree

31:43.110 --> 31:45.271
I'm sick of being a tree.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.193
That's enough for today. Thank you.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.238
No, wait a minute.
We still have three more seasons yet.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.283
I'm sorry, Sharon, I'm gonna
need the stage for my drama class.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.407
Sharon, what about tonight?

31:58.584 --> 32:01.997
-How about a hamburger later?
-l'm busy.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.424
-How about tomorrow?
-Busy.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.088
So maybe you can explain
about the bowling alley.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.383
I mean, you just don't kiss a guy and...

32:17.477 --> 32:19.388
Look, it was just a joke. Forget it.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.725
-Let me give you a hand.
-I can manage.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.101
Look, I said I can manage.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.854
-I think he's in love.
-I think he's kind of cute.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.856
I think you should shut your yaps.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.070
You forgot this one.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.780
-Thanks.
-How about the day after tomorrow?

32:48.800 --> 32:49.835
Stephanie?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.755
Look, when are you
gonna get the picture?

32:57.476 --> 33:00.263
If you really wanna know

33:00.354 --> 33:03.346
What / want in a guy

33:03.440 --> 33:06.773
Well, I’m lookin’ for a dream
on a mean machine

33:06.860 --> 33:09.397
With hell in his eyes

33:09.488 --> 33:12.980
/ want a devil in skin-tight leather

33:13.075 --> 33:16.067
He’s gonna be wild as the wind

33:16.161 --> 33:18.618
And one ﬁne night

33:18.997 --> 33:21.989
I’ll be holdin’ on tight

33:22.084 --> 33:25.201
To a cool rider

33:25.295 --> 33:28.162
A cool rider

33:28.256 --> 33:32.374
If he’s cool enough
he can burn me through and through

33:34.513 --> 33:37.300
If it takes forever

33:37.391 --> 33:40.758
Then I’ll wait forever

33:40.852 --> 33:44.515
No ordinary boy,
no ordinary boy is gonna do

33:45.023 --> 33:48.641
/ want a rider that’s cool

34:05.210 --> 34:07.952
That’s the way it’s gonna be

34:08.046 --> 34:11.083
And that’s the way that I feel

34:11.174 --> 34:14.211
/ want a whole lot more
than the boy next door

34:14.302 --> 34:17.465
/ want hell on wheels

34:17.556 --> 34:20.423
Just give me a black motorcycle

34:20.517 --> 34:23.759
With a man growin’ out of the seat

34:23.854 --> 34:26.971
Then move aside

34:27.065 --> 34:29.727
’Cause I’m gonna ride

34:29.818 --> 34:33.060
With a cool rider

34:33.155 --> 34:35.942
A cool rider

34:36.032 --> 34:40.150
If he’s cool enough
he can burn me through and through

34:42.289 --> 34:45.156
If it takes forever

34:45.250 --> 34:48.242
Then I’ll wait forever

34:48.628 --> 34:52.667
No ordinary boy,
no ordinary boy is gonna do

34:52.758 --> 34:56.376
/ want a rider that’s cool

35:06.855 --> 35:09.437
/ don ’t want no ordinary guys

35:09.524 --> 35:11.310
Comin’ on strong with me

35:13.779 --> 35:18.990
They don ’t know what I’m lookin’ for
They don ’t know what I need

35:19.743 --> 35:22.075
You’re gonna know it when he gets here

35:22.162 --> 35:25.575
’Cause the ground will be shakin’

35:25.665 --> 35:29.533
I’ll do anything
to let him know that I’m his

35:29.628 --> 35:31.368
His for the takin’

35:31.463 --> 35:34.751
/ want a cool rider

35:34.841 --> 35:37.503
A cool, cool, cool, cool rider

35:37.594 --> 35:40.427
/ want a cool rider

35:40.931 --> 35:43.593
A cool, cool, cool, cool rider

35:43.683 --> 35:49.019
I want a C-O-O-L R—l—D-E-R

35:51.024 --> 35:55.188
English, I got something
scholastic to discuss with you.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.361
What I'm saying is that, you know,
you're Mr. History, right?

35:58.448 --> 36:01.155
Like, I got this essay on
the fall of Rome.

36:01.243 --> 36:03.905
I didn't even know they were in trouble.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.158
-What are you driving at, DiMucci?
-Papers for paper.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.456
Essays for cash?

36:11.753 --> 36:13.789
-So that's it.
-What's what?

36:14.589 --> 36:20.425
-There's gonna have to be a motorcycle.
-Good idea. Invest in a cycle. So?

36:20.512 --> 36:23.094
-So you've got a deal.
-Hey. All right.

36:23.181 --> 36:27.390
Listen, when we make the drop,
not out here in the open like this.

36:27.477 --> 36:29.468
I got a rep to protect.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.991
lt's open.

36:46.371 --> 36:50.080
Your uncle said you was back out here.
What is this joint?

36:50.166 --> 36:52.657
-|t's his nuclear fallout shelter.
-Yeah?

36:53.628 --> 36:56.415
-You got that essay?
-You got the cash?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.259
This is a neatjoint.

37:07.350 --> 37:11.218
A nucleoid shelter.
lt's private, good for homework

37:11.313 --> 37:14.305
and other activities
involving student bodies.

37:26.828 --> 37:30.195
You can handle a couple
of history assignments also?

37:30.290 --> 37:33.908
-l'll try.
-Okay, and remember, this is between us.

37:34.502 --> 37:37.244
-I got a rep to protect here, okay?
-Yeah.

37:41.676 --> 37:45.260
William the Conqueror, by the Goose.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.725
God.

38:11.206 --> 38:15.199
Nobody, but nobody,
knows this happened, dig?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.494
Whatever you say.

38:20.048 --> 38:23.165
That's very nice. Nice penmanship.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.217
Remember. I got a rep to protect.
Okay, Shakespeare?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.308
Reproduction.

38:45.115 --> 38:48.152
It's very simple,
but yet, very important.

38:49.411 --> 38:53.404
Now, what is the best time of the month
for a woman to conceive?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.371
Mr...

39:01.840 --> 39:03.376
Jaworski.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.212
-What's "conceive"?
-Well, you know, to be fertile.

39:10.974 --> 39:11.963
What's the best time?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.019
Ask Nogerelli.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.220
Mr. Nogerelli?

39:21.609 --> 39:22.598
Ask Goose.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.021
Mr. Goose?

39:26.948 --> 39:28.028
Ask DiMucci.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.157
-Mr. DiMucci?
-What?

39:31.911 --> 39:35.039
Conceive. What is the best time?

39:35.165 --> 39:36.530
At night?

39:37.500 --> 39:40.458
You know, I can see that
we're not getting very far.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.331
I got the same problem.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.917
-Morning, everybody.
-Good morning.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.338
-Good morning, Mr. Stuart.
-Good morning.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.513
Why don't we just start
at the beginning?

39:54.017 --> 39:55.848
-Page one.
-Open your book.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.602
"Where do babies come from?"

39:59.731 --> 40:02.063
If you need me, I'll be right over here.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.318
Do we need this for the exam?

40:07.739 --> 40:11.197
The parts of a flower
are so constructed that

40:11.284 --> 40:16.153
Very, very often
the wind will cause pollination

40:16.706 --> 40:22.121
If not, then a bee or
any other nectar-gathering creature

40:22.212 --> 40:26.125
Can create the same situation

40:27.759 --> 40:32.594
Yes, anything that gets the pollen
to the pistil’s right on the list

40:32.972 --> 40:35.258
I’ll try to make it crystal clear

40:35.934 --> 40:38.300
A flower’s insatiable passion

40:38.394 --> 40:40.976
turns its life
into a circus of debauchery

40:43.191 --> 40:47.434
Now you see just how the stamen
gets its lusty dust on to the stigma

40:49.364 --> 40:54.575
And why this frenzied chlorophyllous
orgy starts each spring is no enigma

40:55.620 --> 40:58.908
We call this quest for satisfaction
a what, class?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.664
A photoperiodic reaction

41:01.751 --> 41:03.582
That’s good
That’s very good

41:03.670 --> 41:05.285
Hey, I’m lost. Where are we?

41:05.380 --> 41:07.291
-Chapter 2
-Page ﬁve

41:07.382 --> 41:10.499
-Reproduction

41:17.308 --> 41:20.345

41:22.605 --> 41:25.972
/ don ’t think they even know
what a pistil is

41:26.151 --> 41:27.687
I got your pistil right here

41:28.027 --> 41:30.018
Where does the pollen go?

41:30.113 --> 41:32.320
Get back here.
Would you get into your seats?

41:34.284 --> 41:36.024
-Sit down.
-Next chapter.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.485
How, in an abstract way,
the same thing applies

41:38.580 --> 41:41.788
to the reproductive organs
of the more complex life-forms.

41:41.875 --> 41:45.242
But we are now dealing
with sexual response.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.461
Are there any questions
before we begin reading?

41:48.548 --> 41:52.791
Is it possible the female member
of some sex on a couch

41:52.886 --> 41:57.801
Could, like, get this guy all hot
and she never even knew it?

41:58.474 --> 41:59.509
Negative

41:59.601 --> 42:02.638
When a warm-blooded mammal
in a tight little sweater

42:02.729 --> 42:07.143
Starts pulling that stuff
she’s saying that she wants to do it

42:07.942 --> 42:09.318
Can’t prove it by me

42:09.402 --> 42:12.894
’Cause they change their tune
when you got ’em in the back seat

42:12.989 --> 42:16.356
-With his heart beatin’ fast
-They make it sound like a track meet

42:16.451 --> 42:17.941
-Gross!
-Yeah

42:18.036 --> 42:19.742
Then all they can do is say,

42:19.829 --> 42:22.036
"No, no, no! "

42:22.540 --> 42:25.623
-Reproduction
-Reproduction

42:25.752 --> 42:28.664

42:32.508 --> 42:35.796

show me that you really love me so

42:41.476 --> 42:43.216
/ think I’m gonna throw up

42:43.311 --> 42:45.552
Where does the pollen go?

42:45.939 --> 42:48.146
Mr. Goose, please be seated.

42:51.611 --> 42:54.193
The human is the only being capable

42:54.280 --> 42:56.817
of consciously controlling
his number of offspring.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.198
Now, are there any comments on that?

42:59.285 --> 43:00.741
Yeah, I was wondering
if you could tell me where she lives.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.955
-Yeah. What is this?
-Mr. Stuart...

43:03.039 --> 43:06.497
Is it true that guys like you
You know, mature and all

43:06.584 --> 43:11.203
Carry some protection with them
for sexual occasions?

43:11.297 --> 43:12.582
-God.
-What's the big deal?

43:12.715 --> 43:15.878
Can a girl just do that thing in a book

43:15.969 --> 43:20.759
Where she adds up the days of her,
what do you call it, mentalstration?

43:20.848 --> 43:22.588
That's really neat!

43:22.684 --> 43:26.268
Yeah, and what if a guy says
the numbers don't add up right, huh?

43:26.646 --> 43:28.932
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

43:29.023 --> 43:30.103
Hey, hey...

-Stop.

44:12.942 --> 44:15.524
Hey, what's the rush?
You gotta take a pill?

44:16.362 --> 44:19.104
Try to remember, Mr. Stuart,

44:19.198 --> 44:22.326
that their bodies
are more developed than their minds.

44:22.410 --> 44:25.322
-I understand. I understand.
-They have drives, Mr. Stuart.

44:25.413 --> 44:27.995
-Lustfu| drives.
-I understand.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.413
Good.

44:30.335 --> 44:33.623
-Hi, Mr. Stuart.
-Hi, Mr. Stuart.

44:36.299 --> 44:38.961
-May I speak to you, Miss McGee?
-Yes, dear. What about?

44:39.052 --> 44:42.465
I'm a little worried.
I've missed my last two periods.

44:42.764 --> 44:45.881
That's all right, dear,
you can make them up after school.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.182
Where does the pollen go?

44:50.146 --> 44:51.386
Nice one, Davey.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.306
That does it.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.862
Yep. Follow me.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.532
Quite a selection here.

45:05.620 --> 45:09.283
All very, very serviceable machines,
young man.

45:09.374 --> 45:13.993
One or two of these were my personal
transportation a few spare parts ago.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.039
All it takes is a little elbow grease

45:16.130 --> 45:19.122
and any one of these beauties
is a fixer-upper.

45:20.009 --> 45:22.625
-Think you got yourself a bike.
-Great.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.382
-And you're gonna need these.
-Thanks.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.136
Good luck.

45:52.542 --> 45:55.158
Cool rider

45:55.420 --> 45:58.287
A cool rider

45:58.381 --> 46:02.294
If he’s cool enough
he can burn me through and through

46:04.595 --> 46:07.462
If it takes forever

46:07.557 --> 46:10.924
Then I’ll wait forever

46:34.876 --> 46:39.461
-Good to see you, French.
-What were you trying to do?

46:40.965 --> 46:44.878
I'm trying to ride that motorcycle
without bloody well killing myself.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.818
Wait a second. Michael.

47:13.039 --> 47:17.829
Michael, this isn't for Stephanie?

47:19.003 --> 47:21.039
I’ll be yours in winter

47:21.380 --> 47:24.508
When the snow is on the ground

47:24.592 --> 47:27.208
l’ll warm you through December

47:27.303 --> 47:30.170
And I’ll always be around

47:34.602 --> 47:37.639
-That will be all for today.
-Blanche!

47:37.939 --> 47:38.928
No, wait a minute,

47:39.023 --> 47:41.230
we still have some more seasons
we haven't done for you yet.

47:41.317 --> 47:44.809
We have to start with winter and fall
because Paulette's late and...

47:45.363 --> 47:46.569
Well, she was late again today,

47:46.656 --> 47:49.318
but she's here now and we'd like to do
summer and spring for you.

47:49.784 --> 47:52.025
Sharon, will you stop yelling?

47:52.119 --> 47:53.325
You're in the show.

47:55.081 --> 47:56.196
Next.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.372
The Preptones.

48:02.547 --> 48:06.039
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

48:06.300 --> 48:10.794
These are my boys. Look.
Good, clean-cut American boys.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.264
I know.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.807
Then tell her
that her lonesome nights are over

48:16.894 --> 48:20.557
Sandman, I’m so alone

48:20.648 --> 48:23.264
Don’t have nobody to call my own

48:23.901 --> 48:26.688
Please turn on your magic beam

48:27.113 --> 48:30.401
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

48:31.284 --> 48:33.900
-That was wonderful.
-Yes.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.070
The T-Bones.

48:38.457 --> 48:40.072
Birds. T-Birds.

48:46.257 --> 48:50.216
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird

48:50.303 --> 48:51.418
Pro w/in ’. . .

48:51.596 --> 48:53.427
These are my boys.

48:54.265 --> 48:58.099
Walk, talk like a T-Bird tonight

48:59.854 --> 49:00.843
Pro w/in ’. . .

49:00.938 --> 49:02.053
Thank you.

49:02.148 --> 49:04.639
That was just wonderful.

49:04.734 --> 49:06.520
Yeah. It was very nice.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.398
Yeah, we could work a little bit
on the harn-omies, you know.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.695
-Catch you later, Miss McGee.
-Thank you.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.402
My mom wants you to come over

49:14.493 --> 49:16.449
for a pasghetti
at your convenience, you know.

49:17.913 --> 49:19.073
Thank you, Nogerelli.

49:19.457 --> 49:22.369
-Talk of practice over mid-term break.
-Johnny, practice?

49:34.430 --> 49:39.800
I’ll be yours in springtime
When the flowers are in bloom

49:39.894 --> 49:45.389
We’ll wander through the meadows
In all their sweet perfume

49:50.279 --> 49:53.737
I’ll be your girl for all seasons

49:54.742 --> 49:57.984
-Disaster!
-What? We blew it?

49:58.079 --> 49:59.159
No, we made it.

49:59.246 --> 50:00.747
But we can't sing in public,
we're the worst.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.787
-We'll get unworst.
-Yeah, we'll get livenrvurst.

50:02.917 --> 50:03.906
We'll get knackwurst.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.332
How did we get in?

50:05.419 --> 50:06.920
Obviously they recognize natural talent.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.666
Everybody made it.
They didn't have enough acts.

50:09.924 --> 50:11.039
Get him!

50:19.016 --> 50:22.975
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

50:23.104 --> 50:26.562
Make her the cutest that I’ve ever seen

50:26.649 --> 50:29.732
Give her two lips like roses in clover

50:30.319 --> 50:34.608
If we are gonna win that grand prize,
we've got to get it together like that.

50:34.699 --> 50:36.109
But with class.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.158
-Remember, lwant the Roy Orbisons.
-You'll get 'em.

50:40.496 --> 50:46.583
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

50:46.669 --> 50:49.752
I'm talkin' a matter of only weeks
before the talent show.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.124
I'm talkin' winnin' albumens.

50:51.257 --> 50:53.589
-l'm talkin' progress.
-l'm not talkin'.

51:21.579 --> 51:22.659
Scum!

51:29.628 --> 51:32.244
Balmudo's out front and he's all alone.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.085
Tilt. My turn.

51:35.176 --> 51:39.590
Your turn after we tilt that
crater face, Balmudo. Come on.

51:42.391 --> 51:45.428
-Comb.
-Louis, be careful.

51:47.188 --> 51:48.803
Smoke.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.226
Light.

52:04.497 --> 52:05.657
Comb, again.

52:14.548 --> 52:15.754
Let's go, you guys.

52:19.053 --> 52:21.089
-Come on, action out front.
-What?

52:21.180 --> 52:23.216
Balmudo's gonna get his face mangled.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.719
-All right.
-My gosh.

52:28.312 --> 52:30.223
Hey, where is that rat-face...

52:30.856 --> 52:33.313
You lookin' for a rat-face, mouse-brain?

52:38.113 --> 52:41.526
Get that... Get that mutha!

52:48.833 --> 52:54.920
Who, who, who’s that guy?

52:56.215 --> 53:02.211
Who, who, who’s that guy?

53:03.389 --> 53:07.223
He came out of the darkness
in the middle of the night

53:07.309 --> 53:11.052
Blazin’ like a mutha
with a ﬁst of dynamite

53:11.397 --> 53:14.764
He ain't foolin’ no one
on that pile of chrome and steel

53:14.859 --> 53:18.477
Burnin’ up the pavement
like he was some kind of wheel

53:18.571 --> 53:22.314
He ’3 lookin’ for a rumble
and some heads are gonna bust

53:22.408 --> 53:25.900
He ’3 gonna take a tumble
with one solitary thrust

53:26.036 --> 53:31.872
The only thing you guys are gonna do
is eat his dust

53:33.794 --> 53:37.332
Who’s that guy? Where did he come from?

53:37.464 --> 53:41.298
-Who’s that guy?
-Hey, tell me someone

53:41.427 --> 53:46.342
/ never knew anyone could be so cool

53:48.851 --> 53:52.139
-Who’s that guy?
-What’s so amazin’?

53:52.396 --> 53:56.139
From headlight to tailpipe
His burners are blazin’

53:56.233 --> 54:01.478
Looks to me like he could really fly

54:01.822 --> 54:04.313
-Who’s that guy?
-Who’s that guy?

54:06.869 --> 54:09.281
Who’s that guy?

54:15.252 --> 54:17.629
Who’s that guy?

54:18.672 --> 54:21.709
He wears a pair of goggles
like a man from outer space

54:21.800 --> 54:22.926
Shut up!

54:23.052 --> 54:25.919
It really doesn’t matter
that I haven’t seen his face

54:26.388 --> 54:29.755
We’re gonna wrap those handlebars
around that neck of his

54:29.892 --> 54:33.384
-The punk is gonna get it
-When we ﬁnd out who he is

54:34.063 --> 54:37.430
Everybody wants you
when they don ’t know who you are

54:37.524 --> 54:40.891
If you’re a man of mystery
it really takes you far

54:41.278 --> 54:46.489
Everyone around you
thinks that you’re a star

54:48.827 --> 54:52.411
-Who’s that guy?
-Where did he come from?

54:52.581 --> 54:54.492
Who’s that guy?

54:54.625 --> 54:56.331
Where can I get one?

54:56.418 --> 55:01.958
They never knew that I could be so cool

55:03.926 --> 55:07.293
-Who’s that guy?
-On that motorcycle?

55:07.680 --> 55:11.218
What would they say
if they knew it was Michael?

55:11.350 --> 55:16.561
Looks to me like he could really fly

55:17.022 --> 55:19.889
Won ’t somebody tell me?

55:19.984 --> 55:22.475
-Who’s that guy?
-Who’s that guy?

55:29.368 --> 55:30.448
Pretty cool stuff.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.948
Everyone inside...

55:40.170 --> 55:41.159
We bowl.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.291
-All right!
-Yeah, we bowl.

55:46.051 --> 55:49.134
-Hey, DiMucci, did you see that?
-Yeah, I saw it.

55:51.682 --> 55:52.922
Hey, come on, Steph.

55:54.018 --> 55:55.804
l'll catch up with you guys
in a few minutes, okay.

55:55.894 --> 55:58.476
-Hey, what's eatin' you?
-Nothin'.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.741
You know, Steph. There's been talk.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.443
We haven't been talkin',

56:14.747 --> 56:18.365
but there has been talks that
question your loyalty to the Birds.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.166
Well, it doesn't mean
you gotta go steady with Johnny.

56:21.253 --> 56:24.290
In fact, I think it's better
for the both of you that it's over.

56:24.381 --> 56:28.715
Yeah, but the code does say
we're T-Bird chicks, at least till grad.

56:30.679 --> 56:31.885
Let's go, Louis.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.258
You know, maybe I'm tired
of being someone's chick.

56:34.558 --> 56:36.423
"Tired of being someone's chick"?

56:36.518 --> 56:37.894
Are you feeling okay?

56:39.730 --> 56:42.563
-Yo, Ritter.
-Yo, Goose.

56:43.525 --> 56:45.026
I don't know what I'm feeling.

56:46.153 --> 56:49.395
Here, have a ciggy.
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

56:51.617 --> 56:52.982
Those guys are show-offs.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.572
God, I hate those kind of matches.

56:56.663 --> 56:57.914
Did you get them from the liquor store
down the street?

56:57.998 --> 56:59.499
-No.
-Thanks.

57:20.479 --> 57:21.468
Want a ride?

57:31.573 --> 57:32.688
Some other time.

58:04.982 --> 58:08.315
I heard there was this motorcycle chase
outside the Bowl-a-Rama last night,

58:08.443 --> 58:11.526
and according to Paulette Rebchuck,

58:11.613 --> 58:15.481
this very mysterious and gorgeous guy

58:15.576 --> 58:19.285
knocked one Stephanie Zinone
right out of her bobby socks.

58:19.371 --> 58:21.157
-How do you plead?
-I am guilty.

58:22.749 --> 58:26.458
-Great. But now what?
-We've got a problem.

58:26.545 --> 58:28.752
On that motorcycle, in that gear,

58:28.839 --> 58:31.501
I knocked that girl
right out of her socks.

58:31.800 --> 58:34.587
-But like this...
-You'll knock her into her socks.

58:34.678 --> 58:37.215
Yeah, simple, I have to tell her.
Next time I see her...

58:37.931 --> 58:39.046
Come here.

58:41.018 --> 58:44.476
Next time I see her,
I'm going to walk up to her and say,

58:45.856 --> 58:47.346
"Steph..."

58:51.778 --> 58:52.813
Hiya, girls.

58:54.114 --> 58:55.775
Your boyfriend's here.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.616
-Having a facial?
-Yeah.

59:04.082 --> 59:05.538
Delish.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.330
-Steph.
-What?

59:15.010 --> 59:16.466
Do you...

59:17.596 --> 59:18.585
What?

59:19.056 --> 59:20.387
Have you...

59:23.060 --> 59:25.221
Ever read a Superman comic?

59:25.312 --> 59:26.893
Not in the last few hours.

59:29.650 --> 59:31.891
I was just checking. Right?

59:34.571 --> 59:35.811
Just checking.

59:37.574 --> 59:39.815
He needs the guidance counselor.

59:39.910 --> 59:42.276
Rhonda, you got a nose job.

59:42.621 --> 59:44.577
Forget it. I walked into a door.

59:44.706 --> 59:45.866
So she says.

59:46.166 --> 59:49.283
Attention, attention, please.

59:49.836 --> 59:53.374
This is a test.
I repeat, this is a test.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.254
Please do not panic.

59:55.342 --> 59:57.173
-This is a simulation...
-Nuclear war is like football,

59:57.261 --> 59:58.842
if the Russians throw the bomb,

59:58.929 --> 1:00:01.136
all we have to do isjump up,
intercept it,

1:00:01.223 --> 1:00:02.713
then ram it down their own end zone.

1:00:02.808 --> 1:00:04.548
You hear me? It's like life.

1:00:04.643 --> 1:00:06.634
Somebody throws something at you,
you throw it back.

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:09.682
Please proceed to your nearest shelter.

1:00:10.565 --> 1:00:13.728
Boys to one side, girls to the other.
Run, run, run!

1:00:13.902 --> 1:00:16.359
Blanche, please do not panic.

1:00:16.697 --> 1:00:19.655
Miss McGee, it's so loud.

1:00:21.994 --> 1:00:24.485
Please do not panic.

1:00:34.172 --> 1:00:35.912
I don't know how
you talked me into this, Louis.

1:00:36.008 --> 1:00:39.500
Hey, listen,
you trust President Kennedy?

1:00:39.594 --> 1:00:40.629
Of course.

1:00:40.721 --> 1:00:44.839
All right. Kennedy says we gotta
be prepared for a nucleoid war.

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:49.017
-|t's nuclear, Louis.
-Yeah. Nuclelar, nucular...

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:52.100
A bomb's a bomb.

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:35.101
Yeah.

1:01:45.744 --> 1:01:48.486
This is an official fallout shelter bed.

1:01:50.415 --> 1:01:52.246
Hey, you gotta be prepared,

1:01:52.334 --> 1:01:54.575
'cause some day,
when you least expect it...

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.373
Nucleoid war!

1:02:00.384 --> 1:02:01.840
-What's that?
-|t's started.

1:02:02.636 --> 1:02:05.844
America is calling

1:02:05.931 --> 1:02:09.344
Let’s care enough to give our very best

1:02:09.559 --> 1:02:11.140
What's started? What's happening, Louis?

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:13.264
The Russians are attacking. Get down.

1:02:14.606 --> 1:02:17.473
For if we give our very best

1:02:17.567 --> 1:02:21.560
/ know that
we will more than pass the test

1:02:21.738 --> 1:02:23.353
What are you doing, Louis?
Get off of me!

1:02:23.448 --> 1:02:24.483
Think about it.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:26.155
What if you and me was to die

1:02:26.243 --> 1:02:28.484
right here tonight
without ever doing it?

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:29.829
”It”?

1:02:30.539 --> 1:02:32.325
Oh, my God! Let me out of here, Louis!

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:34.498
Are you crazy?
They're dropping bombs out there.

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:38.042
Yeah, let’s do it for our country

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:40.917
The red, white and the blue

1:02:41.508 --> 1:02:46.593
It’s Uncle Sam who’s asking
So your mother will approve

1:02:47.305 --> 1:02:52.299
Tomorrow I’ll be ﬁghting
And I’ll win this war for you

1:02:52.853 --> 1:02:55.811
Let’s do it for our country

1:02:55.897 --> 1:02:58.855
Our country wants us to

1:03:00.193 --> 1:03:01.182
Louis.

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:03.143
Bullets are exploding

1:03:03.238 --> 1:03:06.196
They’ll soon be at the door

1:03:06.283 --> 1:03:11.073
Give something to America
you never gave before

1:03:11.538 --> 1:03:15.156
Yeah, let’s do it for our country

1:03:15.250 --> 1:03:17.286
The red, white, and the blue

1:03:18.253 --> 1:03:19.868
But are you sure
my mother would approve?

1:03:22.174 --> 1:03:25.132
Your mother don't even
have to know about it, Sharon.

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:27.004
And you think we're old enough to go?

1:03:31.183 --> 1:03:33.390
-All the way.
-Louis.

1:03:34.019 --> 1:03:36.180
-But, Louis, you might get hurt.
-I know.

1:03:37.939 --> 1:03:39.975
-God.
-Just think about it, Sharon.

1:03:40.066 --> 1:03:42.933
It would be like as if we were doing it
for the Statue of Liberty.

1:03:46.656 --> 1:03:47.816
It'll be like we're doing it for

1:03:47.908 --> 1:03:49.569
-for Disneyland!
-for Disneyland!

1:03:49.826 --> 1:03:53.865
Yeah, let’s do it for our country

1:03:53.955 --> 1:03:56.913
The red, white, and the blue

1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:02.415
It’s not a lot to ask of us
Our parents will approve

1:04:02.672 --> 1:04:08.042
-You’ll be a mighty soldier
-Before this night is through

1:04:08.220 --> 1:04:11.633
Let’s do it for our country

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:14.058
We owe it to our country

1:04:14.142 --> 1:04:17.305
Let’s do it for our country

1:04:17.395 --> 1:04:21.229
Our country wants us to

1:04:24.069 --> 1:04:25.730
-I'm ready, Louis.
-Me, too.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:28.482
-Hurry, come on, let's sign up.
-What? No, don't!

1:04:32.077 --> 1:04:34.489
Guess you didn't get any, Babooch?

1:04:35.330 --> 1:04:38.868
Louis DiMucci! God!

1:04:41.336 --> 1:04:42.826
How could you do this?

1:04:47.926 --> 1:04:50.383
Okay, that'll be about $1.60.

1:04:50.470 --> 1:04:51.880
Hey, will you get my windshield?

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:53.970
Yeah. Hold on. Just a second.

1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:02.596
Hey, miss, can I pay you
so I can get out of here?

1:05:02.691 --> 1:05:06.104
Yeah, look, hold on
just one minute, okay?

1:05:08.113 --> 1:05:09.649
-Sorry.
-|t's all right.

1:05:13.159 --> 1:05:15.445
Okay, that's two, three, four, five.

1:05:15.537 --> 1:05:16.697
Where are the maps?

1:05:18.456 --> 1:05:20.287
-What kind do you want?
-Street maps.

1:05:20.667 --> 1:05:21.656
Yeah?

1:05:30.677 --> 1:05:33.885
Hey, miss. What do I owe you?

1:05:37.017 --> 1:05:38.177
Fifty cents.

1:05:45.609 --> 1:05:46.769
How about that ride?

1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:48.396
Hey, how about my windshield?

1:05:51.072 --> 1:05:53.529
Excuse me, you forgot our green stamps.

1:05:53.617 --> 1:05:55.573
We're in a hurry. What about the maps?

1:05:57.203 --> 1:05:58.943
Are you going to get
this windshield or not?

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:00.658
Come on.

1:06:04.753 --> 1:06:07.210
Honk that horn
where the sun don't shine!

1:06:07.297 --> 1:06:08.833
Steph? Where are you going?

1:07:01.476 --> 1:07:03.216
I can't stop shivering.

1:07:04.020 --> 1:07:05.180
Then hold on.

1:07:06.564 --> 1:07:08.145
That's what's making me shiver.

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:24.533
-Great ride.
-We're home.

1:07:31.047 --> 1:07:32.082
Shoot

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:10.874
I'm the one
who can't stop shivering now.

1:08:12.547 --> 1:08:13.536
VVhy?

1:08:13.631 --> 1:08:14.666
Because”.

1:08:20.305 --> 1:08:24.924
-There's something I should tell you.
-What?

1:08:27.479 --> 1:08:28.514
No.

1:08:29.814 --> 1:08:31.429
We've got company.

1:08:33.943 --> 1:08:35.274
Check this out!

1:08:36.488 --> 1:08:37.773
I can handle these guys.

1:08:37.864 --> 1:08:41.152
-That's the dude who popped Balmudo.
-Yeah, and look who he's poppin' now.

1:08:41.785 --> 1:08:43.366
When am I gonna see you again?

1:08:44.621 --> 1:08:46.407
Friday night. The Talent Show.

1:08:46.498 --> 1:08:48.113
Let's go!

1:08:51.044 --> 1:08:52.784
Out front, you hear?

1:08:54.422 --> 1:08:56.128
"Talent Show"?

1:08:59.427 --> 1:09:01.008
How'd he know?

1:09:05.016 --> 1:09:06.005
Hi.

1:09:08.895 --> 1:09:09.884
What are you guys doin'?

1:09:15.318 --> 1:09:17.809
So, what's the story
with the creep on the bike, Zinone?

1:09:18.696 --> 1:09:20.732
-What do you mean?
-The story. The creep.

1:09:20.824 --> 1:09:24.362
-Yeah, the creep, the story, Stephanie.
-Shut up, Goose.

1:09:24.452 --> 1:09:27.615
-Why don't you just leave her alone?
-You shut up.

1:09:27.705 --> 1:09:29.741
-You. Let's have it.
-Have what?

1:09:29.833 --> 1:09:31.789
-The story.
-Personally, I think...

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:33.741
We don't care, Sharon!

1:09:33.837 --> 1:09:37.830
Look, Zinone, no chick of mine messes
with no other creep except this...

1:09:38.508 --> 1:09:40.669
-Except me.
-No chick of yours?

1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:42.045
Someone's jealous.

1:09:42.136 --> 1:09:44.092
Why don't you ever
getjealous like that over me, Johnny?

1:09:44.180 --> 1:09:45.169
Because I ain'tjealous!

1:09:45.265 --> 1:09:47.802
Why don't you just stay
out of my life, then, Johnny?

1:09:47.892 --> 1:09:48.972
I'm out!

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:53.519
I catch you with that punk
one more time, I'll rearrange his face.

1:09:53.606 --> 1:09:56.188
He's a dead man,
you know what I'm saying? D-E-D!

1:09:56.276 --> 1:09:58.267
Look, I think you better decide
once and for all

1:09:58.361 --> 1:09:59.692
just who belongs to who around here.

1:09:59.779 --> 1:10:01.986
-Pau|ette, you're making a scene.
-Because I'm getting all mixed up

1:10:02.073 --> 1:10:03.734
and I don't like how that feels
one little bit.

1:10:03.825 --> 1:10:05.440
You know, you're embarrassing me.

1:10:07.871 --> 1:10:10.157
I think you owe Paulette an apology.

1:10:11.416 --> 1:10:13.953
-Jerk!
-Where are you goin'?

1:10:14.669 --> 1:10:16.159
Forget about it.

1:10:16.629 --> 1:10:18.620
-Weirdos.
-Yeah, who needs broads, right?

1:10:18.715 --> 1:10:20.706
Me! I get to second base with Sharon,

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:23.462
keep getting called out
when I try to slide into third.

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:25.089
And the poor guy bombed out

1:10:25.179 --> 1:10:26.589
-in the bomb shelter.
-Hey.

1:10:26.681 --> 1:10:31.516
Yeah. I think we could all use
a little guaranteed...

1:10:31.603 --> 1:10:32.809
...all-the-way action.

1:10:33.938 --> 1:10:36.224
-And I knowjust the place.
-Yeah?

1:10:37.358 --> 1:10:39.940
Well, come on and tell us, Johnny

1:10:40.778 --> 1:10:42.905
What’s the secret of success?

1:10:42.989 --> 1:10:47.028
You gotta take a tip
From the King of Hip

1:10:47.118 --> 1:10:51.703
’Cause you know that he’s the best

1:10:54.125 --> 1:10:56.161
We ’re goin’ prowlin’

1:10:57.337 --> 1:10:59.328
We ’re goin’ prowlin’

1:11:00.924 --> 1:11:02.460
Tonight

1:11:10.767 --> 1:11:13.759
You say you’re hungry for a lover

1:11:13.853 --> 1:11:16.686
Gotta ﬁnd a chick who’ll give you more

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:20.189
Well, there ’3 a spot
That I’ve discovered

1:11:21.027 --> 1:11:23.564
Where a guy’s guaranteed to score

1:11:24.155 --> 1:11:27.397
I’m gonna show you cats some action

1:11:27.575 --> 1:11:30.362
Like you’ve never seen before

1:11:30.745 --> 1:11:34.408
We’re gonna get some satisfaction

1:11:34.791 --> 1:11:37.453
Down at the grocery store

1:11:37.543 --> 1:11:40.831
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird

1:11:40.922 --> 1:11:44.005
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird

1:11:44.092 --> 1:11:45.628
We ’re goin’ prowlin’

1:11:45.718 --> 1:11:50.007
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird tonight
-Tonight

1:11:51.099 --> 1:11:54.057
There ’s a female butcher

1:11:54.435 --> 1:11:57.643
-At the luncheon meat display
-Well, don’t you know?

1:11:57.730 --> 1:12:00.813
-Got the best tongue in town
-That’s right

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:04.017
She delivers both night and day

1:12:04.112 --> 1:12:07.445
You’ll see the apple of your eye

1:12:07.532 --> 1:12:10.774
Stacking peaches in a ﬁve-foot pile

1:12:11.119 --> 1:12:13.405
Just waitin’ for some guy to come

1:12:14.205 --> 1:12:17.572
And take her rollin’ down the aisle

1:12:17.667 --> 1:12:20.909
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-/ like a debutante who comes across

1:12:21.004 --> 1:12:23.666
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Now, that’s what I call class

1:12:24.132 --> 1:12:28.341
/ like a tall girl with long legs
that come right up to her...

1:12:28.428 --> 1:12:33.047
You know what / like?
/ like a girl who’s really smart

1:12:33.141 --> 1:12:36.304
Provided that she’s really stacked

1:12:36.394 --> 1:12:40.808
Yeah? Well, l/ove ’em all
And they love me

1:12:40.898 --> 1:12:44.766
’Cause I’m the leader of this here pack

1:12:44.861 --> 1:12:47.193
-Yeah!
-We're gonna ﬁnd ourselves some cuties

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:50.772
-Cuties gonna ﬁnd...
-Who are sad and all alone

1:12:50.867 --> 1:12:54.405
-We're gonna show them little beauties
-Little beauties

1:12:54.495 --> 1:12:57.532
That we’re T-Birds to the bone

1:12:57.623 --> 1:13:00.956
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird

1:13:01.044 --> 1:13:04.252
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:07.796
-We’re goin’ prowlin’
-Walk, talk like a T-Bird

1:13:07.884 --> 1:13:10.671
Tonight

1:13:10.762 --> 1:13:12.468
We ’re goin’ prowlin’

1:13:12.555 --> 1:13:14.762
Goose, go for the sales tax.

1:13:22.065 --> 1:13:25.808
Very nice. Very nice.
We could win those albumens yet.

1:13:25.902 --> 1:13:29.360
-We can win those albumens.
-We gotta get rid of the competition.

1:13:29.447 --> 1:13:30.436
Competition.

1:13:31.866 --> 1:13:34.073
Well, there is some very good work here,

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:39.029
and there is also
some very sloppy work here.

1:13:40.541 --> 1:13:44.955
Miss Zinone, I would like to see you
about your Shakespeare essay.

1:13:49.092 --> 1:13:53.836
Attention, please. A few reminders
of graduation activities.

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:58.765
The ﬁnal dress rehearsal for
the Talent Show is Thursday afternoon.

1:13:58.851 --> 1:14:02.309
Also, will all students
on the decoration committee

1:14:02.396 --> 1:14:05.308
for the Lani Kai Lani Luau on Saturday

1:14:05.399 --> 1:14:08.186
report to Coach Calhoun
after school today.

1:14:08.277 --> 1:14:10.393
Who asked him
to write all that stuff anyway?

1:14:10.947 --> 1:14:12.608
I guess she didn't like your paper.

1:14:12.698 --> 1:14:16.282
No kiddin'. I gotta write
the whole thing again.

1:14:16.369 --> 1:14:19.111
-Do you want some help?
-I don't know.

1:14:22.083 --> 1:14:25.701
Think it over.
It's not a difficult decision.

1:14:29.757 --> 1:14:32.669
-Steph, you comin'?
-Yeah.

1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:34.170
I'll think about it.

1:14:47.942 --> 1:14:50.024
You know, I don't usually do
this bad in English.

1:14:50.111 --> 1:14:52.978
It's just, I got other stuff on my mind
these days.

1:14:53.072 --> 1:14:55.984
-Anything I can help you with?
-No, it's not with school. Forget it.

1:14:56.075 --> 1:14:58.987
-Let's get this stuff over with.
-All right.

1:14:59.996 --> 1:15:01.486
Where do you want to start?

1:15:04.375 --> 1:15:06.957
-|t's this guy.
-What guy?

1:15:07.545 --> 1:15:08.705
Forget it.

1:15:08.796 --> 1:15:11.333
Well, I'm trying,
but you're not making it very easy.

1:15:11.424 --> 1:15:15.337
I had this idea of Mr. Right. Remember?
Which is a stupid idea, right?

1:15:16.095 --> 1:15:19.337
-Right.
-And then, out of nowhere, he shows up.

1:15:19.432 --> 1:15:22.674
-Like some dream or something.
-Who?

1:15:22.768 --> 1:15:25.305
-Mr. Right.
-Right.

1:15:25.897 --> 1:15:28.559
And then the crazy thing is
that I've seen him twice now,

1:15:28.649 --> 1:15:30.480
and both times,
he's wearing these goggles.

1:15:30.568 --> 1:15:31.933
I don't even know who he is.

1:15:32.028 --> 1:15:33.438
-Mr. Right? Right.
-Right.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:35.235
Don't you think that's kind of weird?

1:15:41.662 --> 1:15:42.697
So, what's the problem then?

1:15:44.624 --> 1:15:48.242
Well, the problem is that maybe
he's just not everything I imagined.

1:15:48.336 --> 1:15:51.123
What if behind those goggles
he's just, like, some ordinary guy?

1:15:51.797 --> 1:15:53.128
What if he is?

1:15:59.597 --> 1:16:03.055
What if maybe we should get back
to the Shakespeare essay?

1:16:03.142 --> 1:16:04.177
Stephanie.

1:16:04.268 --> 1:16:07.135
You know what, I figured out
what Hamlet's big problem is.

1:16:07.230 --> 1:16:08.219
No ketchup.

1:16:10.566 --> 1:16:12.272
He seemed to get along
pretty well without it.

1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:14.066
They never put ketchup on,
even when you ask for it.

1:16:14.153 --> 1:16:15.939
How can you eat a hamburger
with no ketchup?

1:16:16.030 --> 1:16:17.895
-I wouldn't know.
-Could you shoot that over here?

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:21.986
Where were we?

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.532
You'd figured out the problem
with their hamburgers. No ketchup.

1:16:25.623 --> 1:16:28.865
Right. And you know
what his big problem is?

1:16:30.002 --> 1:16:32.414
No laughs. I mean, the guy's
gotta lighten up, right?

1:16:32.546 --> 1:16:33.535
-Right.
-Bﬂe?

1:16:34.757 --> 1:16:36.338
No, thanks.

1:16:37.134 --> 1:16:38.340
Who are we talking about now?

1:16:40.429 --> 1:16:41.418
Hamlet.

1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:45.089
Right.

1:16:49.855 --> 1:16:51.436
"Hamlet went totally nuts

1:16:51.524 --> 1:16:53.731
"when he caught his mother doing it
in the sack with his uncle."

1:16:53.818 --> 1:16:57.231
-Not so great, right?
-Well, you seem to have the right idea,

1:16:57.321 --> 1:16:59.312
but you could've said something like,

1:16:59.407 --> 1:17:05.368
"Hamlet was tormented by his mother's
incestuous relationship with his uncle."

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:08.366
"Incestuous relationship"? God.

1:17:08.457 --> 1:17:10.618
Mason's gonna flip when she reads this.

1:17:11.127 --> 1:17:12.958
"Incestuous."

1:17:13.254 --> 1:17:15.711
You're a really smart guy,
you know that?

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.001
You must think I'm some kind of dummy?

1:17:20.011 --> 1:17:21.751
Actually, lthink
you're kind of terrific.

1:17:22.805 --> 1:17:24.545
Get outta here.

1:17:25.599 --> 1:17:26.588
You're the terrific one.

1:17:26.684 --> 1:17:28.675
I mean, you know all this deep junk
and everything.

1:17:29.353 --> 1:17:32.186
I don't understand that "deep junk"
any better than you do, really.

1:17:32.273 --> 1:17:35.390
I just seem to know a few big words
that impress English teachers,

1:17:35.484 --> 1:17:36.940
like our friend Miss Mason, that's all.

1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:39.276
Well, you impressed me.

1:17:39.947 --> 1:17:41.858
And I give credit to who I want, okay?

1:17:43.159 --> 1:17:47.619
-To whom.
-To who, to whom, to you, that's whom.

1:17:47.705 --> 1:17:49.661
So learn how to take a compliment,
all right?

1:17:51.292 --> 1:17:52.281
All right.

1:17:55.046 --> 1:17:58.209
Hey, how about a hamburger
for my friend here? Loaded.

1:17:58.299 --> 1:17:59.709
With ketchup.

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:01.210
Double ketchup.

1:18:03.387 --> 1:18:07.721
There are some very cool, very scoreable
broads who hang out at this joint.

1:18:07.808 --> 1:18:10.971
"Cool". "Scoreable". Whatnot.

1:18:11.062 --> 1:18:13.474
-Very nice.
-Very nice.

1:18:13.814 --> 1:18:14.803
I bet there's lots of girls at Rydell

1:18:14.899 --> 1:18:16.435
who'd love to go out
with a guy like you.

1:18:16.525 --> 1:18:18.732
-What about you?
-Me? Yeah, right.

1:18:18.819 --> 1:18:20.901
Are you kidding?
That's all I need right now.

1:18:20.988 --> 1:18:22.569
No, I wasn't.

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:26.486
God, look,
I didn't mean anything wrong, but...

1:18:26.577 --> 1:18:29.535
We're just different types, that's all.

1:18:29.622 --> 1:18:31.112
"Different types"?

1:18:31.791 --> 1:18:32.951
What do you mean?

1:18:34.085 --> 1:18:36.872
-Look, there's a Pink Lady code, okay?
-"Pink Lady code."

1:18:36.962 --> 1:18:39.669
Well, to quote Dolores,
"The code stinks."

1:18:48.224 --> 1:18:51.216
-Hi.
-So, what's this? Nerds' night out?

1:18:51.310 --> 1:18:53.266
What are you, a cop?

1:18:53.896 --> 1:18:56.137
Sure have picked up
a lot of new friends, Zinone.

1:18:56.816 --> 1:18:59.102
I guess the T-Birds
ain't the class act no more?

1:18:59.193 --> 1:19:01.149
Yeah, I guess we ain't
the class act no more?

1:19:01.237 --> 1:19:02.898
-Goose.
-Yo, Johnny.

1:19:02.988 --> 1:19:04.489
You wait for me inside.

1:19:04.573 --> 1:19:06.950
-Johnny, I don't want to eat alone.
-Will you go on?

1:19:07.034 --> 1:19:09.195
What do you want, Johnny?

1:19:11.789 --> 1:19:15.828
Yeah, well,
I just wanted to let you know that...

1:19:16.377 --> 1:19:18.959
I'm officially declaring us
as an item officially over.

1:19:20.589 --> 1:19:22.671
-You're declaring?
-That's correct.

1:19:24.468 --> 1:19:26.709
Okay, fine. Okay? You've declared it.

1:19:26.804 --> 1:19:28.965
It's over. Can I go now?

1:19:32.226 --> 1:19:33.762
Just like that?

1:19:38.274 --> 1:19:40.139
I got one more thing to say to you.

1:19:41.026 --> 1:19:43.608
That jacket you're wearing
is T-Bird property.

1:19:43.696 --> 1:19:45.232
You want to leave the party?

1:19:45.322 --> 1:19:47.278
Drop the jacket at the door
on your way out.

1:19:47.366 --> 1:19:49.231
I got a rep to protect.

1:19:49.326 --> 1:19:51.863
So don't damage the rep,
we don't damage new friends, dig?

1:20:05.009 --> 1:20:06.294
So, what happened?

1:20:06.385 --> 1:20:09.172
Did she take the nerd's brains
over your brawns?

1:20:09.513 --> 1:20:11.720
Look, I dumped her,
not versa-vice, got it?

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:13.183
Right. Sure, Johnny.

1:20:16.061 --> 1:20:17.392
Don't worry about it.

1:20:40.794 --> 1:20:43.171
-All right, cherry pie!
-God. Davey!

1:20:50.638 --> 1:20:53.129
I’m all dressed up

1:20:55.309 --> 1:20:58.346
In my ﬁnest attitude

1:20:59.104 --> 1:21:04.440
Pretending I don ’t care

1:21:06.195 --> 1:21:08.436
Guess I really messed up

1:21:10.032 --> 1:21:13.024
By trying to be two

1:21:13.285 --> 1:21:18.996
When only one heart can be there

1:21:19.959 --> 1:21:26.797
Why can’t I be just what I am

1:21:27.132 --> 1:21:34.049
And speak my love without any shame

1:21:34.515 --> 1:21:40.351
Why can’t she see what I am

1:21:42.648 --> 1:21:45.685
Is a costumed fool

1:21:45.818 --> 1:21:48.685
Trapped in a tragic game

1:21:50.322 --> 1:21:56.238
Charades and pretty lies

1:21:57.454 --> 1:22:04.326
They hide what’s deep inside me

1:22:04.712 --> 1:22:10.708
Charades conceal me

1:22:11.176 --> 1:22:15.260
But can’t you feel

1:22:16.098 --> 1:22:17.929
The real me

1:22:19.685 --> 1:22:21.721
The real me

1:22:25.065 --> 1:22:29.525
Behind my Charades

1:22:37.119 --> 1:22:39.952
Please don ’t mind me

1:22:41.790 --> 1:22:45.078
Performing at my hardest

1:22:45.169 --> 1:22:51.586
As lpaint upon the air

1:22:51.675 --> 1:22:55.293
You won ’t ﬁnd me

1:22:55.387 --> 1:23:01.383
’Cause it’s a portrait of the artist
As the man who isn’t there

1:23:01.518 --> 1:23:05.386
Look, the programs for the Talent Show.
We're gonna be on first.

1:23:07.316 --> 1:23:13.107
Charades and pretty lies

1:23:14.615 --> 1:23:21.532
They hide what’s deep inside me

1:23:21.622 --> 1:23:28.084
Charades conceal me

1:23:28.295 --> 1:23:34.632
But can’t you feel the real me?

1:23:36.679 --> 1:23:39.045
The real me

1:23:42.309 --> 1:23:45.722
Behind my Charades?

1:23:45.813 --> 1:23:49.351
Can’t you feel the real me

1:23:49.441 --> 1:23:53.059
Behind my Charades?

1:23:53.153 --> 1:23:57.146
Have I lost the real me

1:23:57.241 --> 1:24:04.158
Behind my Charades?

1:24:22.641 --> 1:24:25.633
Girls, girls, I'm so nervous.
How do I look?

1:24:25.728 --> 1:24:28.470
You look perfect. Just remember,
have lots of fun tonight.

1:24:29.314 --> 1:24:30.690
Okay. Thanks.

1:24:30.774 --> 1:24:32.685
-And good luck!
-Yeah, good luck!

1:24:32.776 --> 1:24:34.357
He said he'd meet her out front.

1:24:34.445 --> 1:24:37.482
How anyone can get so hot and bothered
over someone they don't even know

1:24:37.573 --> 1:24:39.154
is totally beyond me.

1:24:39.450 --> 1:24:40.986
Sharon.

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:42.941
-What?
-She's got a crush.

1:24:56.759 --> 1:24:57.794
I'll be back.

1:25:05.392 --> 1:25:09.305
-|t's that guy.
-This time we get him, Zinone!

1:25:09.396 --> 1:25:10.431
Johnny,no!

1:25:14.026 --> 1:25:15.015
Johnny!

1:25:20.365 --> 1:25:23.027
Rhonda! Rhonda. Rhonda, go.
They're going to kill him.

1:25:23.118 --> 1:25:27.361
-Who's killing who?
-Open the door. Move over.

1:25:27.456 --> 1:25:30.243
-Where are we going?
-I don't know, just go!

1:25:39.176 --> 1:25:41.041
-Rhonda!
-Oh, my God!

1:25:41.136 --> 1:25:43.468
We're gonna die and I'm wearing
my mother's undenNear!

1:25:43.555 --> 1:25:47.013
-Steph, where are we going?
-I don't know. Just follow 'em!

1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:48.089
Here they come!

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:21.791
I figured the guy to slow up.

1:26:22.886 --> 1:26:24.171
Right?

1:26:27.432 --> 1:26:33.723
Yeah, it ain't ourfault
the guy don't slow up, Johnny?

1:26:33.814 --> 1:26:35.850
It's gotta be at least 100 feet

1:26:35.941 --> 1:26:37.397
-to the other side.
-Johnny.

1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:41.648
Yeah, yeah, what can I say?

1:26:41.822 --> 1:26:45.565
If he didn't make it,
he ain't gonna look too pretty.

1:26:53.709 --> 1:26:54.915
Where is he?

1:26:58.130 --> 1:26:59.870
He ain't down there.

1:26:59.965 --> 1:27:02.672
What do you mean "he ain't down there"?
Where'd he go? Biker heaven?

1:27:03.969 --> 1:27:05.505
I know he's dead.

1:27:05.596 --> 1:27:07.302
Yeah, well, it's obvious.

1:27:07.389 --> 1:27:09.596
He made the jump. I could do that.

1:27:09.683 --> 1:27:13.267
-Yeah, you could jump that, Johnny.
-Let's go.

1:27:13.395 --> 1:27:15.681
-And I'll never see him again.
-Come on!

1:27:22.613 --> 1:27:24.649
-What have I done?
-Nothing, Steph.

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:27.231
-He'll be okay.
-Steph, nobody rides like him.

1:27:27.326 --> 1:27:28.611
There's nothing even down there.

1:27:28.702 --> 1:27:30.988
Come on, we gotta get outta here.
You can't stay here.

1:27:31.079 --> 1:27:32.364
Come on, we're gonna be late!

1:27:32.456 --> 1:27:33.571
Look, you saw him.

1:27:33.665 --> 1:27:35.656
He jumped over a cop car
at the Bowl-a-Rama

1:27:35.751 --> 1:27:36.991
and that was a really big jump!

1:27:37.085 --> 1:27:40.043
He'll show up, I know it.
| just know it.

1:27:50.182 --> 1:27:53.219
If your sweetheart

1:27:53.310 --> 1:27:59.476
Sends a letter of goodbye

1:28:01.485 --> 1:28:04.101
-If I stand over there...
-Don't worry about it. It looks fine.

1:28:04.196 --> 1:28:05.185
Just get out there.

1:28:05.948 --> 1:28:09.031
-Hi, Johnny.
-Hi... Hold it!

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:16.576
What are you, crazy?

1:28:17.834 --> 1:28:18.960
Come on, Paulette.

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:22.457
Look, I told you before, you are not
gonna go out there like that.

1:28:22.547 --> 1:28:25.289
I know, I gotta put
a little something on my face.

1:28:27.469 --> 1:28:29.710
You have got to put
a little something on your body.

1:28:29.805 --> 1:28:32.842
But I gotta dress like this, Johnny.
I'm summer.

1:28:32.933 --> 1:28:35.094
Look, now, get yourself
a pair of galoshes,

1:28:35.185 --> 1:28:38.677
a snowsuit, a scarf, and be winter.

1:28:38.772 --> 1:28:42.230
And that
is Johnny Nogerelli's final word.

1:28:42.317 --> 1:28:43.306
Yeah?

1:28:44.152 --> 1:28:48.486
Well, you want to hear my final word,
Mr. Push-Everyone-Around Nogerelli?

1:28:48.573 --> 1:28:50.074
Maybe you can bully

1:28:50.158 --> 1:28:51.898
-some of the chicks in this school...
-Be cool, Paulette.

1:28:51.994 --> 1:28:55.987
...but this chick has been bullied by
one Johnny Nogerelli for the last time.

1:28:56.081 --> 1:28:58.823
I may not be
the classiest chick in this school,

1:28:58.917 --> 1:29:02.751
but I'm the best you're ever gonna get,
so take it or leave it!

1:29:02.838 --> 1:29:05.204
...behind the cloudy sky

1:29:05.298 --> 1:29:09.507
So let your hair down

1:29:10.595 --> 1:29:15.055
And go on and cry

1:29:15.350 --> 1:29:16.806
Let go of me!

1:29:16.893 --> 1:29:19.179
Johnny!Johnny!

1:29:21.565 --> 1:29:22.850
Stop that!

1:29:25.027 --> 1:29:27.439
-Shut up!
-Quiet!

1:29:28.697 --> 1:29:33.282
And now, Martin Miesner
and his red-hot accordion.

1:29:33.368 --> 1:29:35.984
-Let's go practice up in the can.
-Johnny, we got nothing to worry about.

1:29:36.079 --> 1:29:37.660
Don't worry, Johnny, we're gonna have...

1:29:37.748 --> 1:29:38.737
Hey, the albumens are ours.

1:29:43.670 --> 1:29:47.879
-Hey, he's taking ourjackets.
-Hey, come on, guys.

1:29:48.133 --> 1:29:49.623
Hey, guys...

1:29:49.718 --> 1:29:51.208
Hey, Nogerelli!

1:29:53.513 --> 1:29:55.720
Don't do it. Okay, guys.

1:29:56.892 --> 1:30:01.056
Turn it off! Hey, Nogerelli!

1:30:18.789 --> 1:30:21.405
Thank you, Martin Miesner.

1:30:22.250 --> 1:30:28.837
And now, I have the great pleasure
to introduce the T-Bones.

1:30:37.349 --> 1:30:38.634
Come on, Steph.

1:30:38.725 --> 1:30:43.719
We ’re goin’ pro w/in ’, pro w/in’

1:30:43.814 --> 1:30:47.432
Tonight

1:30:47.526 --> 1:30:49.858
Tonight

1:31:01.456 --> 1:31:04.619
-The T-Bones.
-Birds! Birds.

1:31:06.211 --> 1:31:12.878
And now, the Calendar Girls
in A Girl For All Seasons.

1:31:40.370 --> 1:31:45.990
I’ll be yours in springtime
When the flowers are in bloom

1:31:46.084 --> 1:31:51.875
We’ll wander through the meadows
In all their sweet perfume

1:31:52.007 --> 1:31:58.674
And every night I’ll hold you tight
Beneath that April moon

1:32:01.850 --> 1:32:07.891
I ’I/ be your girl for all seasons
All the year through

1:32:07.981 --> 1:32:13.567
Your girl for all seasons
’Cause I ’d love

1:32:13.653 --> 1:32:18.943
Yes, I’d love to be everything to you

1:32:19.284 --> 1:32:22.242
Just you

1:32:22.913 --> 1:32:28.249
I’ll be yours in summer
When we’re playing in the sand

1:32:28.335 --> 1:32:34.171
We 7/ spend the day together
Making love and getting tanned

1:32:34.257 --> 1:32:41.004
And on the beach at sunset
When we’re walking hand in hand

1:32:44.142 --> 1:32:47.726
I ’I/ be your girl for all seasons

1:32:47.812 --> 1:32:50.064
All the year through

1:32:50.148 --> 1:32:53.390
Your girl for all seasons

1:32:53.485 --> 1:32:56.147
’Cause I ’d love

1:32:56.238 --> 1:33:01.574
’Cause I’d love to be everything to you

1:33:01.660 --> 1:33:03.901
Just you

1:33:04.829 --> 1:33:10.449
If you fall in the fall you’ll see

1:33:10.543 --> 1:33:16.038
September can be heavenly

1:33:16.675 --> 1:33:22.420
If you fall, say you’ll fall for me

1:33:22.514 --> 1:33:28.760
When autumn leaves
Are falling from the trees

1:33:28.853 --> 1:33:34.393
I’ll be yours in winter
When the snow is on the ground

1:33:34.484 --> 1:33:40.104
I ’I/ warm you through December
And I’ll always be around

1:33:40.699 --> 1:33:42.235
What's wrong with Stephanie?

1:33:42.325 --> 1:33:44.190
It looks like she forgot the words.

1:33:44.286 --> 1:33:46.322
Somebody help her with the words.

1:33:48.373 --> 1:33:49.488
Is she sick?

1:33:49.582 --> 1:33:52.369
-Johnny, it’s that guy!
-This time we get him, Zinone!

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:55.327
Johnny! Where is he?

1:33:55.463 --> 1:33:56.623
He ain't down there.

1:33:56.715 --> 1:33:59.377
What do you mean, "He ain't down there"?
Where’d he go?

1:33:59.467 --> 1:34:01.583
I know he’s dead.

1:34:01.970 --> 1:34:03.301
Louis, pull the curtain.

1:34:08.101 --> 1:34:09.716
I'll be back.

1:34:12.772 --> 1:34:13.887
What's the matter?

1:34:13.982 --> 1:34:16.064
No more midnight rides with you

1:34:16.693 --> 1:34:19.901
No more secret rendezvous

1:34:19.988 --> 1:34:21.444
Stephanie, what's wrong?

1:34:21.865 --> 1:34:28.782
I ’m gonna miss
All the things we’ll never do

1:34:30.957 --> 1:34:34.074
I just can’t believe

1:34:35.086 --> 1:34:38.920
You left me here alone

1:34:40.008 --> 1:34:43.375
How in this world

1:34:44.012 --> 1:34:49.052
Can I make it on my own?

1:34:57.942 --> 1:35:02.276
Remember, Ilove you

1:35:02.364 --> 1:35:07.028
I won ’t be far away

1:35:07.243 --> 1:35:11.532
Baby, close your eyes

1:35:11.623 --> 1:35:15.161
And think of yesterday

1:35:15.251 --> 1:35:20.746
And we’ll be there together

1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:27.712
Love will turn back the hands of time

1:35:27.806 --> 1:35:29.922
Turn back

1:35:30.016 --> 1:35:31.927
Turn back

1:35:32.018 --> 1:35:35.886
The hands of time

1:35:36.731 --> 1:35:39.848
Baby, don’t you know?

1:35:41.027 --> 1:35:44.940
It’s hard to let you go

1:35:45.740 --> 1:35:49.699
Save all your dreams

1:35:49.786 --> 1:35:54.371
And keep me in your heart

1:35:54.541 --> 1:35:58.204
It hurts to say goodbye

1:35:59.045 --> 1:36:03.084
No matter how I try

1:36:04.050 --> 1:36:07.838
Love will survive

1:36:07.929 --> 1:36:12.389
Even though we have to part

1:36:13.893 --> 1:36:15.884
Stephanie, please don ’t cry

1:36:16.855 --> 1:36:21.895
It all seems so unfair
Just when I found you, I lost you

1:36:22.735 --> 1:36:24.726
That doesn ’t matter now

1:36:24.821 --> 1:36:27.483
The only thing that matters
Is that I love you

1:36:27.574 --> 1:36:30.987
And you’re the only one
Who can keep our love alive

1:36:31.077 --> 1:36:33.113
So, Stephanie, don ’t forget me

1:36:33.705 --> 1:36:35.661
I promise

1:36:35.748 --> 1:36:37.534
Remember

1:36:37.625 --> 1:36:40.002
Ilove you

1:36:40.086 --> 1:36:44.955
You won ’t be far away

1:36:45.049 --> 1:36:47.882
I just close my eyes

1:36:49.053 --> 1:36:52.591
And bring back yesterday

1:36:52.891 --> 1:36:58.386
And we’ll be there together

1:36:58.521 --> 1:37:05.233
Love will turn back the hands of time

1:37:05.612 --> 1:37:07.648
Turn back

1:37:07.739 --> 1:37:11.698
Turn back the hands of time

1:37:11.784 --> 1:37:14.446
We 7/ turn back

1:37:14.537 --> 1:37:16.698
Turn back

1:37:16.789 --> 1:37:20.702
Turn back the hands of time

1:37:20.793 --> 1:37:23.751
We 7/ turn back

1:37:44.651 --> 1:37:47.939
And now,
the winners of the Talent Contest,

1:37:48.029 --> 1:37:53.774
and the King and Queen
of the Lani Kai Lani Luau, Mr. Nogerelli

1:37:55.662 --> 1:37:57.402
and Miss Zinone.

1:37:59.499 --> 1:38:02.457
Please, Miss Zinone,
remember you're a queen.

1:38:03.628 --> 1:38:04.743
Smile, Stephanie.

1:38:04.837 --> 1:38:07.089
Yeah. I think you won
the whole talent show.

1:38:07.173 --> 1:38:10.040
-The Girls' division, Paulette.
-That's not so bad.

1:38:10.134 --> 1:38:15.754
Everyone bow and we'll see you all

1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:23.099
I can't believe we won half the records.
All the Tichokski and Choppin.

1:39:55.406 --> 1:40:00.491
If only this feeling could go on forever

1:40:00.578 --> 1:40:05.572

Rock-a-hu/a luau
Rock-a-hu/a luau

1:40:38.157 --> 1:40:41.741
As the sun sets
on the Lani Kai Lani Luau,

1:40:41.828 --> 1:40:43.784
a reminder to our seniors,

1:40:43.871 --> 1:40:47.204
in the words of our very own
President Kennedy,

1:40:47.291 --> 1:40:50.328
"Think not what your country
can do for you,

1:40:50.420 --> 1:40:53.583
"but what you can do for your country.”

1:40:53.673 --> 1:40:56.585
Now, will the King and Queen of the Luau

1:40:56.676 --> 1:41:00.715
take their appointed positions
on the Pool of Enchantment?

1:41:31.586 --> 1:41:33.872
Come on, we're havin' a good time!
It's a luau.

1:41:33.963 --> 1:41:35.464
Will you stop it? What are you doing?

1:41:35.548 --> 1:41:37.413
I dropped a cigarette.
I'm burnin' myself.

1:41:37.508 --> 1:41:39.590
You're gonna burn us up with that
cigarette! Can't you put it out?

1:41:39.677 --> 1:41:42.009
-You're gonna knock us over.
-Will you cut it out?

1:41:42.096 --> 1:41:43.381
I'm tryin' to be cool here!

1:41:43.473 --> 1:41:46.010
-You get me out of here right now.
-Would you be quiet?

1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:48.807
Your doctor is quite right, Mr. Spears.

1:41:48.895 --> 1:41:53.138
The school environment is so much
better for you than the hospital.

1:41:53.232 --> 1:41:55.609
But I am encouraged... Hello, dear.

1:41:55.693 --> 1:41:58.275
...at the way
you've been looking lately.

1:41:58.362 --> 1:42:02.150
You look so... Mr Spears!

1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.156
Good heavens!

1:42:11.834 --> 1:42:13.870
Sit down, Stephanie. Before you fall in.

1:42:26.224 --> 1:42:29.933
-Will you help me row, Stephanie?
-Stop yelling at me!

1:42:30.019 --> 1:42:31.600
Get out of the way!

1:42:36.734 --> 1:42:38.315
You punk!

1:42:38.402 --> 1:42:41.064
Haul ass, shrimp!

1:42:41.155 --> 1:42:45.273
-Get off of me!
-Come on! Will you help me row?

1:42:46.410 --> 1:42:47.866
Get out of here!

1:42:47.954 --> 1:42:49.034
Punks!

1:42:49.121 --> 1:42:50.907
-Stuck in a pool with a chick!
-You're rowing the wrong way!

1:42:50.998 --> 1:42:51.987
Birds, get 'em!

1:42:52.083 --> 1:42:56.452
-I got one! I got one!
-Sorry!

1:42:58.089 --> 1:43:00.250
-Get off!
-I didn't mean it.

1:43:08.558 --> 1:43:10.014
Hey, Balmudo!

1:43:10.101 --> 1:43:11.932
Hey, man. That's the guy who decked me.

1:43:12.019 --> 1:43:13.304
It's him.

1:43:13.396 --> 1:43:15.057
-|t's him!
-|t's him!

1:43:46.095 --> 1:43:47.631
He's alive!

1:44:00.318 --> 1:44:02.684
-What's wrong with you guys, man?
-You've ruined our luau!

1:44:02.778 --> 1:44:03.813
You ruined everything!

1:44:11.162 --> 1:44:14.495
Michael! It's Michael!

1:44:21.964 --> 1:44:22.999
Michael.

1:44:31.057 --> 1:44:33.469
-You?
-You made thatjump?

1:44:33.559 --> 1:44:34.594
Shakespeare?

1:44:39.190 --> 1:44:40.771
I thought you were dead.

1:44:44.445 --> 1:44:46.106
-You?
-Move it! Move it!

1:44:46.238 --> 1:44:48.149

-Hey!

1:44:49.283 --> 1:44:50.659
-What?
-Nothing.

1:44:56.082 --> 1:44:59.870
-No.
-Yeah. Yeah, Johnny.

1:45:01.087 --> 1:45:02.998
Yeah, well, you got one more jump,

1:45:03.089 --> 1:45:07.708
Mr. Cool Rider, Shakespeare, Carrington.

1:45:07.802 --> 1:45:10.339
No, wait a second.
Haven't we had enough of this?

1:45:10.429 --> 1:45:11.760
She's got a point, Johnny.

1:45:11.847 --> 1:45:12.973
Hey, Davey's got a point, Johnny.

1:45:13.057 --> 1:45:16.140
-Hey, Lou's got a point about Davey's...
-Shut up, all of yous!

1:45:16.227 --> 1:45:18.183
I've got a point to make, too.

1:45:21.148 --> 1:45:23.013
-Jacket
-One T-Bird jacket.

1:45:29.073 --> 1:45:30.062
Jacket

1:45:33.369 --> 1:45:34.404
Jacket

1:45:39.917 --> 1:45:41.532
For starters, let's see how it looks.

1:45:49.927 --> 1:45:51.337
Very nice.

1:45:53.806 --> 1:45:54.841
Okay.

1:45:55.975 --> 1:45:57.465
Birds... Okay.

1:45:57.935 --> 1:46:00.017
-All right.
-All right.

1:46:03.149 --> 1:46:04.810
Listen, I gotta talk to you.

1:46:05.818 --> 1:46:08.184
We can't see each other anymore
because, you know,

1:46:08.279 --> 1:46:11.146
I've sorta got another man
on my hands now.

1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:12.320
Right.

1:46:19.206 --> 1:46:20.491
That's the breaks.

1:46:20.583 --> 1:46:21.572
Right.

1:46:24.587 --> 1:46:28.045
What's everybody lookin' at? Disperse!

1:46:50.821 --> 1:46:52.072
Stephanie.

1:46:59.121 --> 1:47:02.284
I never thought you'd kiss me
like that if you knew who I really was.

1:47:02.374 --> 1:47:03.705
Are you crazy?

1:47:04.585 --> 1:47:06.450
I got two for the price of one.

1:47:08.047 --> 1:47:12.006
-Are you certain?
-I've never been certainer.

1:47:12.718 --> 1:47:14.174
More certain.

1:47:15.888 --> 1:47:17.344
The certainest.

1:47:17.431 --> 1:47:21.049
The certainest. Yeah, I like that.

1:47:22.353 --> 1:47:24.344
I'd love to kiss you again.

1:47:39.453 --> 1:47:42.911
You were the one, the one in my dreams

1:47:42.998 --> 1:47:46.081
But I never knew it

1:47:46.585 --> 1:47:49.918
I wanted to tell you time and again

1:47:50.005 --> 1:47:53.088
But I couldn’t do it

1:47:54.135 --> 1:47:57.468
All that you are is all that I need

1:47:57.721 --> 1:48:00.383
No more pretending

1:48:01.100 --> 1:48:04.763
Now I can be me, you can be you

1:48:04.854 --> 1:48:08.813
And we’re never ending

1:48:08.899 --> 1:48:14.394
We’ll be together

1:48:16.115 --> 1:48:22.111
Always together

1:48:23.122 --> 1:48:28.458
Like birds of a feather

1:48:28.544 --> 1:48:32.537
Forever and ever

1:48:32.631 --> 1:48:37.295
We’ll be together

1:48:41.515 --> 1:48:45.007
I like what you got, I guess it’s okay

1:48:45.102 --> 1:48:48.060
If you want to show it

1:48:48.898 --> 1:48:52.436
I am what I am and I’m all for you

1:48:52.526 --> 1:48:55.984
Just want you to know it

1:48:56.071 --> 1:48:58.153
Will I ever score ?

1:48:58.407 --> 1:49:03.026
There’s nothin’ wrong
With just likin’ each other

1:49:03.704 --> 1:49:09.540
We all had our doubts
But it’s workin’ out with one another

1:49:11.170 --> 1:49:16.710
We’ll be together

1:49:18.552 --> 1:49:24.138
Always together

1:49:25.517 --> 1:49:30.853
Like birds of a feather

1:49:30.940 --> 1:49:35.104
Forever and ever

1:49:35.194 --> 1:49:39.403
We’ll be together

1:49:40.616 --> 1:49:46.987
We’ll be together

1:49:47.998 --> 1:49:53.459
Always together

1:49:54.713 --> 1:50:00.083
Like birds of a feather

1:50:00.177 --> 1:50:04.386
Forever and ever

1:50:20.739 --> 1:50:25.904
Like birds of a feather

1:50:26.203 --> 1:50:30.663
Forever and ever

1:50:32.001 --> 1:50:37.541
We’ll be together

1:50:39.258 --> 1:50:45.379
Always together

1:50:46.765 --> 1:50:52.601
We’ll be together

1:50:53.939 --> 1:50:58.228
Always together
