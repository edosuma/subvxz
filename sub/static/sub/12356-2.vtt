00:07.308 --> 00:10.142
<i>My name is Marty Kaan, and
I'm a management consultant.</i>

00:10.194 --> 00:13.229
I took the plea deal so I could
get back to work faster.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.897
So let's just go through
the financials...

00:14.899 --> 00:15.981
Marty, I'm pregnant.

00:16.033 --> 00:18.400
After everything between us,

00:18.402 --> 00:24.240
I rekindled something with
an old college beau, Edwin.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.575
What I'm getting from
Kaan and Associates is shit.

00:26.577 --> 00:28.210
Go fuck yourself
and your lousy business.

00:28.246 --> 00:29.829
You know we can't
afford to lose even

00:29.881 --> 00:31.413
this shitty account, right?
We're broke, completely broke.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.915
Are you nuts, dude? Haven't
you worked for him before?

00:32.967 --> 00:34.750
I never had a problem
with Monica.

00:36.554 --> 00:37.920
Is that Ellis Hightower?

00:37.922 --> 00:40.840
<i> Our boy,</i>
<i>Ellis Gage Hightower,</i>

00:40.892 --> 00:42.224
<i>godhead of electric cars.</i>

00:42.260 --> 00:44.560
<i>This guy's got a lot of money.</i>

00:44.595 --> 00:47.346
- Hey, brother. - <i> And I plan
to take a lot of his money.</i>

00:47.398 --> 00:48.514
<i>This piece of business is</i>

00:48.566 --> 00:50.182
our ticket out of the shit shed.

00:50.234 --> 00:51.934
We need to just get
through this transition,

00:51.936 --> 00:54.570
and then you should
leave... for good.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.608
<i>I just don't think that, uh...</i>

00:59.644 --> 01:01.026
Do we really want to do this?

01:01.078 --> 01:02.444
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:02.446 --> 01:03.746
We already talked about this.
Yeah, I know.

01:03.781 --> 01:05.414
I just think we may
have more perspective

01:05.449 --> 01:06.749
when you get back from
your sister's, don't you?

01:06.784 --> 01:08.200
Oh, speaking of which,
if you wanted

01:08.252 --> 01:09.952
to get a sandwich before
you make your flight.

01:09.954 --> 01:11.203
You are such a pussy sometimes.

01:11.255 --> 01:13.289
Well, I am what I eat.

01:13.341 --> 01:16.125
No, Doug, please, just ask her.
Okay.

01:16.127 --> 01:18.127
Please...

01:18.129 --> 01:20.129
Hey... there she is.

01:20.131 --> 01:21.714
Hi.

01:21.766 --> 01:22.715
Hi.

01:22.767 --> 01:25.301
So, uh, how's it going?

01:25.353 --> 01:27.136
How, uh, how, you know,
how you doing?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.805
It's Joey from <i> Friends.</i>
Do you remember that show?

01:29.807 --> 01:30.973
Good show.
Doug, just...

01:31.025 --> 01:32.391
Yeah, um...

01:32.443 --> 01:34.059
So, Jeannie, listen, uh...

01:34.111 --> 01:37.062
do you remember, uh, how Sarah
lost her job eight months ago?

01:37.114 --> 01:38.647
I know, fuck Obamacare, right?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.616
Didn't you work at
a veterinary clinic?

01:40.651 --> 01:42.117
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:42.153 --> 01:44.119
But regardless, um,
having her around more.

01:44.155 --> 01:46.121
Boy, oh, boy, it's been great.

01:46.157 --> 01:48.991
Just so great, lo, these...
these many, many months.

01:48.993 --> 01:50.326
Ow.

01:50.328 --> 01:52.161
And it gave her
a chance to nest.

01:52.163 --> 01:54.296
Filling the nest, however,
well, that has proved elusive.

01:54.332 --> 01:56.999
Fertility treatments,
countless specialists,

01:57.001 --> 01:58.550
and still you can hear
a big old echo

01:58.586 --> 02:00.002
in that uterus of hers, huh?

02:00.004 --> 02:01.420
Hello, hello, hello.

02:01.472 --> 02:03.255
Okay, also, you know,

02:03.307 --> 02:05.257
his little men are not exactly
Michael Phelps.

02:05.309 --> 02:06.842
Eh, inconclusive.
It's...

02:06.894 --> 02:09.094
Anyway, we were
wondering if, um...

02:09.145 --> 02:10.979
and we totally understand
i-if you don't want to,

02:11.014 --> 02:13.766
but if there was any chance
that you didn't want,

02:13.818 --> 02:15.684
or were thinking about...
Are you asking me for my baby?

02:15.736 --> 02:17.353
Oh... my God,
I think he is.

02:17.355 --> 02:18.821
No, he couldn't possibly.

02:18.856 --> 02:19.855
No offense to you and Edwin...

02:19.857 --> 02:21.357
Well, you've never
met Edwin, so...

02:21.409 --> 02:22.942
Mother and father
on opposite coasts.

02:22.994 --> 02:24.026
Yeah, it's not good.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.361
That's sad to me.
Yes, I'm...

02:25.413 --> 02:26.862
You know, I think
a baby needs stability.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.032
Which the baby would
get with you and Doug?

02:30.084 --> 02:31.533
I do. I think
that that's actually

02:31.535 --> 02:33.786
a very attractive offer.
Is it?

02:33.838 --> 02:36.705
Maybe you don't know this, but
babies come with many hassles.

02:36.707 --> 02:38.707
Oh, and you could come
visit at any time you wanted.

02:38.709 --> 02:40.509
No? Okay. Scheduled visits. That's...
No.

02:40.544 --> 02:42.725
Please never let
this moment end.

02:42.845 --> 02:43.805
- Do you have your video recording device?
- Yeah.

02:43.925 --> 02:45.195
- Yeah, I do.
- Let's get this happening.

02:45.315 --> 02:47.299
What we would love for you to do
is take time and think about it. - Yeah.

02:47.351 --> 02:48.717
I'm not giving you my baby.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.719
You are so fucking selfish.

02:50.721 --> 02:53.555
And you are so fucking
bat-shit crazy.

02:53.557 --> 02:54.556
Oh, Jeannie,
what's the big deal?

02:54.558 --> 02:55.691
Just give 'em the baby.

02:55.726 --> 02:57.559
- It's not like it's a baby.
- We all know

02:57.611 --> 03:00.646
that you are bound
to be a terrible mother.

03:00.698 --> 03:02.481
Oh, you do?
Yeah. Doug, back me up.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.650
Doug, back me up.
Uh...

03:04.702 --> 03:05.623
Ah...
Pick a side, Doug.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.736
I-I don't know if
you'll be great.

03:07.738 --> 03:08.871
Terrible!

03:08.906 --> 03:10.239
Terrible.
So, maybe be wise and

03:10.291 --> 03:11.740
think of us as like preemptive
Child Protective Services.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.042
- Ooh.
- All right,

03:13.077 --> 03:14.543
I'm gonna get some
work done now.

03:14.578 --> 03:16.412
This has been very interesting.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.880
She doesn't even want it.

03:17.915 --> 03:19.498
Yeah? I'll try that.

03:21.252 --> 03:22.918
Um, so, look, I mean,
you probably

03:22.970 --> 03:24.003
don't even want the baby.

03:24.055 --> 03:25.137
I want the baby, Doug.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.423
Okay, well, I know
you have to say that

03:27.425 --> 03:28.590
in front of people,

03:28.592 --> 03:30.059
but between you and me...
I want the baby.

03:30.094 --> 03:32.344
You do.
You've left a path of shattered lives.

03:32.396 --> 03:33.729
What's one more, right?
Oh, good.

03:33.764 --> 03:35.230
So we're on the same page.
Oh, oof!

03:35.266 --> 03:37.599
And that could be a good place
to edit our stuff together.

03:37.601 --> 03:39.401
I don't see how it could get
any better than that. - Yeah.

03:46.777 --> 03:50.079
We will find Doug's body chopped
up in a freezer one day, yeah?

03:50.114 --> 03:52.114
Hm. Fingers crossed.

03:54.585 --> 03:56.952
How's Roscoe?

03:58.172 --> 03:59.955
How's Roscoe?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.761
"He's good, Jeannie.
How's your mom?"

04:05.796 --> 04:07.713
"You know,
she's still a cunt."

04:07.765 --> 04:10.549
Oh, okay, so I'm
the asshole here.

04:10.601 --> 04:12.968
No, you...

04:15.106 --> 04:17.055
Look, you asked me
to leave, I'll leave.

04:17.108 --> 04:18.474
I just don't see the harm

04:18.476 --> 04:21.944
in us h-having
an innocuous conversation.

04:21.978 --> 04:24.730
You still don't think
I meant what I said, hmm?

04:28.486 --> 04:31.153
I just wanted
to know how Roscoe was.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.992
Um...

04:36.994 --> 04:42.247
Roscoe used to have
this book of fables.

04:42.299 --> 04:44.633
Now, he always wanted me
to read him this book

04:44.668 --> 04:47.336
about a girl who lost her
stuffed animal or some shit.

04:47.338 --> 04:49.671
But anyway, I liked the fables.

04:49.723 --> 04:54.309
And, uh, they had this one
about a scorpion and a frog.

04:54.345 --> 04:57.179
You familiar with it?

04:57.231 --> 04:59.014
Um...

04:59.016 --> 05:00.933
So, this scorpion asks this frog

05:00.985 --> 05:04.353
to carry it across a stream
or something, whatever.

05:04.355 --> 05:06.355
And, uh, the frog is, like,

05:06.357 --> 05:08.190
"No way, man.
You're gonna sting me."

05:08.242 --> 05:10.526
And the scorpion
assures the frog

05:10.578 --> 05:12.861
that this is in neither
of their best interests.

05:12.863 --> 05:15.164
"I mean, I kill you,
I drown, right?"

05:15.199 --> 05:17.950
So, the frog sees
the wisdom in this,

05:18.002 --> 05:21.036
and the scorpion hops on
his back, boom, off they go.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.172
Then midstream, sure enough.

05:24.708 --> 05:27.292
Scorpion stings the frog.

05:27.344 --> 05:29.845
And as they both start to sink,

05:29.880 --> 05:33.882
the dying frog
manages a weak, "Why?"

05:33.884 --> 05:36.468
And the scorpion says,

05:36.520 --> 05:39.471
"'Cause I'm a motherfucking
scorpion, that's why."

05:39.523 --> 05:43.942
I mean, I paraphrased
it slightly.

05:45.229 --> 05:47.729
You're a dishonest
person, Jeannie.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.316
And I get dishonesty.

05:51.368 --> 05:53.735
I mean, I do, of course, but...

05:53.787 --> 05:56.288
yours doesn't seem
to have an off switch.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.710
Now, I may end up drowning,

06:01.745 --> 06:03.912
but it's not gonna be
because of you.

06:10.221 --> 06:12.054
Okay, in the morning,
you have exactly 90 minutes

06:12.089 --> 06:14.389
to take a shower, get dressed,
make your bed, and then,

06:14.425 --> 06:17.426
you go to work, and you want to
make sure that you get ever...

06:17.428 --> 06:19.595
Listen, Gabe, I don't need you
to give me every goddamn detail.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.263
Marty, look, when
I first got here,

06:21.265 --> 06:23.065
I had this cellmate
who was a meth dealer.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.933
He was just a total dick.

06:24.935 --> 06:27.186
I kept thinking to myself,
"How'd this guy make any sales

06:27.238 --> 06:28.937
with that kind of
bedside manner?"

06:28.939 --> 06:30.819
Anyway, I told myself
when I got a new cellmate,

06:30.824 --> 06:32.608
I'd do things differently.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.660
So, new cellmate...

06:36.197 --> 06:37.613
...what's your work detail?

06:37.615 --> 06:39.114
Prison garden.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.866
Oh, man.

06:40.918 --> 06:42.534
Get out.

06:42.586 --> 06:44.870
That's where I work, too.
How awesome is that?

06:44.922 --> 06:46.455
It's pretty awesome.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.207
Yeah, it is pretty awesome.

06:48.259 --> 06:51.543
Oh, guess who also works
in the garden-- look.

06:51.595 --> 06:54.463
Am I supposed to know
who the fuck you're pointing at?

06:54.465 --> 06:56.632
The guy with the glasses.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.934
Oh. Okay.
Okay.

06:58.969 --> 07:00.769
That's Ellis Hightower.

07:00.804 --> 07:03.972
You know, we planted carrots
in the garden the other day.

07:03.974 --> 07:05.390
It's no biggie, it's whatever.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.143
Do you want to meet him?

07:08.145 --> 07:09.444
No, not really.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.979
It's Ellis Hightower.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.232
Wow. Rich businessman.

07:13.284 --> 07:16.151
You throw a stick, you fucking
hit ten of 'em in here.

07:16.153 --> 07:18.453
Okay, Ellis is not
a rich businessman.

07:18.489 --> 07:21.323
He's a preeminent genius
of our time.

07:21.325 --> 07:24.243
And I'm not just talking
about electric cars, okay?

07:24.295 --> 07:27.162
He's made amazing strides
in artificial intelligence.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.132
You know, ten years
from now, thanks to Ellis,

07:30.167 --> 07:32.134
your barber is going
to be a robot.

07:32.169 --> 07:35.137
The guy who makes your
coffee is gonna be a robot.

07:35.172 --> 07:37.172
The greeter at your
Gap is gonna...

07:37.224 --> 07:38.640
Don't tell me-- robot.

07:38.676 --> 07:40.676
You know what?
Can I ask you something?

07:40.678 --> 07:42.094
How long before all these, uh,

07:42.146 --> 07:43.979
baristas and barbers
rise up and kill everybody?

07:44.014 --> 07:48.016
People mock
what they don't understand.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.018
Okay. Oh.

07:50.020 --> 07:53.105
Hey, man. Uh...

07:53.157 --> 07:54.273
It's cool.

07:54.325 --> 07:55.691
All right, catch you later, pal.

07:57.161 --> 07:59.528
That was embarrassing.

08:03.701 --> 08:06.034
Hey, Marty?

08:07.538 --> 08:09.871
Marty, are you up?

08:11.875 --> 08:13.041
Marty, are you up?

08:13.093 --> 08:16.628
Ooh... God.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.382
I take full responsibility
for what I did.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.968
Performing unnecessary
root canals

08:23.020 --> 08:25.554
for the insurance
money is wrong,

08:25.606 --> 08:27.973
even if your practice
is struggling.

08:29.727 --> 08:33.028
Touching a boob while a patient
is under-- also, not okay,

08:33.063 --> 08:36.481
no matter how pretty she is.

08:36.533 --> 08:39.067
Still, getting sent to prison

08:39.068 --> 08:42.236
was a real kick in the
jellybeans, you know?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.905
Hey, Gabe?
Yeah?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.741
I'm trying to get
some sleep here, man.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.826
Oh, my God.
I am sorry.

08:47.878 --> 08:49.578
I'm so...

08:49.580 --> 08:52.080
Then I get here,
and there's Ellis.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.832
You know?

08:53.884 --> 08:55.751
Hello, silver lining.

08:55.803 --> 08:59.755
But, uh, the truth is,
the two of us--

08:59.757 --> 09:02.424
we haven't actually
gotten to know each other.

09:02.426 --> 09:04.559
As far as he's concerned,

09:04.595 --> 09:06.261
I'm invisible.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.096
He doesn't even know I exist.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.232
Yeah, well, hopefully,
he'll come around

09:10.267 --> 09:12.768
before the prison
homecoming dance.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.686
I don't think
that we have a prison...

09:14.738 --> 09:16.772
Okay, okay, I see
what you did there.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.190
That's funny.

09:18.242 --> 09:19.608
You're funny.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.360
I like girls...

09:21.412 --> 09:24.162
and so does Ellis.

09:24.198 --> 09:27.032
You know, apparently, he dated
a swimsuit model for a while.

09:27.084 --> 09:30.035
According to <i> Us Weekly,</i>
she wanted more commitment.

09:30.087 --> 09:32.454
But you can't hold a man
like Ellis Hightower down.

09:32.456 --> 09:35.374
Will you shut the fuck up,
please? Just stop.

09:35.426 --> 09:37.042
Stop talking?

09:37.094 --> 09:38.877
Yeah, stop talking.

09:38.929 --> 09:43.465
Especially about some washed-up
asshole like Ellis Hightower.

09:43.467 --> 09:46.968
Okay. Yeah.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.054
Ellis Hightower
is washed-up.

09:49.106 --> 09:51.106
He-He's gonna change the
world, but he's washed-up.

09:51.108 --> 09:52.391
Yeah, he's not gonna
change shit,

09:52.443 --> 09:54.142
especially sitting
on the sidelines

09:54.144 --> 09:55.777
of his own fucking company.

09:55.813 --> 09:57.112
What?

09:57.147 --> 09:59.815
Oh, f... Listen,

09:59.867 --> 10:02.284
we're gonna have a conversation
for a couple seconds

10:02.319 --> 10:03.785
and then we're going the fuck
to sleep, all right?

10:03.821 --> 10:06.738
Right. Conversation,
couple seconds, and F sleep.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.991
The chairman of the board
of Gage Motors...

10:09.993 --> 10:11.827
Dante Valerio.
Yeah, Dante Valerio.

10:11.829 --> 10:12.961
He wants Ellis out.

10:12.996 --> 10:15.247
He's got the votes, okay?

10:15.299 --> 10:18.083
Now, can we get
some sleep, please?

10:18.135 --> 10:20.919
What?

10:20.971 --> 10:25.757
I mean, Ellis must
be freaking out.

10:27.344 --> 10:28.844
That's probably why he's been

10:28.896 --> 10:32.514
so distant lately.
Yeah, that's definitely why.

10:36.186 --> 10:38.520
Right. Okay.
Yeah.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.856
<i> Jeannie, the founder</i>
<i>of your firm is in prison.</i>

10:40.908 --> 10:44.359
We'll only need five minutes.
Float it. What is the worst

10:44.411 --> 10:47.195
that can happen? I get laughed
out of his huge corner office.

10:47.197 --> 10:49.531
Yes, I know we're more
of a boutique firm...

10:49.533 --> 10:52.367
Boutique?
This place is a ghost town.

10:52.369 --> 10:54.503
The only reason
we're having this meeting here

10:54.538 --> 10:56.505
is you can't afford
to buy me lunch.

10:56.540 --> 10:59.174
Okay.

10:59.209 --> 11:02.544
Yes, we took a hit, but...

11:02.596 --> 11:05.847
trimming nonessential staff
and streamlining operations

11:05.883 --> 11:07.466
has actually made us m--

11:07.518 --> 11:09.017
Uh...

11:09.052 --> 11:10.685
sorry, Andrew,
give me one second.

11:14.224 --> 11:16.558
- What? This is important.
- Yeah.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.226
Sorry to interrupt.
Uh, we should really make a move

11:18.228 --> 11:19.978
if we're gonna catch that flight
to Cincinnati.

11:20.030 --> 11:23.031
- Holt Logistics is next week.
- No, we had to move it

11:23.066 --> 11:25.386
to accommodate the consult at
Star Trust Funding, remember?

11:25.402 --> 11:27.736
Oh, shit. Star Trust. Um...
Yeah.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.571
Okay, give me a few
minutes to wrap this up.

11:29.623 --> 11:32.040
Yeah. Course. All right.
Yeah. We'll be over here.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.710
Sorry.
Mm. Wow. Star Trust.

11:35.746 --> 11:38.079
That's the third largest
mortgage lender in the U.S.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.550
We're just doing a top-down
on their information systems.

11:41.585 --> 11:44.002
Obviously, we hope
to impress them to broaden

11:44.054 --> 11:45.670
the scope of the consult, but...
Mm.

11:45.722 --> 11:47.756
Uh, I'm beginning
to question now

11:47.758 --> 11:49.925
whether those orgasms were real.

11:49.977 --> 11:53.845
I'm not following you.
Should I call Star Trust?

11:53.897 --> 11:56.014
Are you accusing me of...
I'm not accusing you of lying.

11:56.066 --> 11:58.433
I'm just gonna call Star Trust
and ask if they've heard

11:58.435 --> 12:00.902
of your little boutique.
Great. Call 'em.

12:00.938 --> 12:04.322
Okay. Hang up. Hang up.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.610
So help me out here--
how did you

12:08.662 --> 12:10.912
finish first
in our business school class?

12:10.948 --> 12:14.115
I have exhausted every lead.

12:14.117 --> 12:16.251
If something doesn't
come through soon,

12:16.286 --> 12:18.920
the firm is gonna flatline.

12:18.956 --> 12:21.873
I just need five minutes.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.960
Sorry, Charlie.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.630
Having said that, I would gladly
have sex with you again.

12:28.632 --> 12:30.549
I'll be sure and pass
that on to your wife.

12:30.601 --> 12:32.133
Oh.

12:32.135 --> 12:34.803
And they weren't real,
by the way.

12:34.805 --> 12:36.855
Right.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:49.119 --> 12:51.069
Oh, hey. Here.

12:51.121 --> 12:54.322
Let-let me give you
a hand. It's... heavy.

12:54.324 --> 12:56.324
You know, for what it's worth,

12:56.376 --> 12:58.827
you know, I think what they're
doing to you is an outrage.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.829
I got it from here.

13:00.831 --> 13:03.331
You know, I-I don't usually
hate people I don't know,

13:03.333 --> 13:04.716
but I hate Dante Valerio.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.134
How can he not recognize
everything...

13:06.169 --> 13:07.502
What are you talking about?

13:07.504 --> 13:10.088
You know, the thing.
The coup.

13:10.140 --> 13:12.507
What coup?
Oh, God, you don't know.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.093
Know what? What fucking coup?
I'm...

13:15.145 --> 13:17.512
I'm probably not the one to...
Is Dante Valerio trying to push me out?

13:17.514 --> 13:20.482
There's no way he has the votes.
Does he have the goddamn votes?

13:20.517 --> 13:23.935
Maybe. I think so. I-I don't, um...
Who are you looking at?

13:23.987 --> 13:25.937
Who the fuck is that?

13:25.989 --> 13:27.522
Hey.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.524
You talking shit about me?

13:29.576 --> 13:31.993
Talking shit ab...

13:32.029 --> 13:33.495
Oh, no, man, I was just trying
to get him to shut up

13:33.530 --> 13:35.030
so I could get some sleep.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.998
I don't know where
you got your information,

13:37.034 --> 13:38.033
but you don't know jack.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.367
I'm calling the shots
from in here.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.202
Nothing happens without my
knowledge, you understand?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.671
Okay.

13:42.706 --> 13:44.673
Dante and I have had
our differences,

13:44.708 --> 13:46.174
but he's not stupid.

13:46.209 --> 13:48.043
He knows what I mean
to that company.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.344
This is fucking absurd.

13:49.379 --> 13:51.212
Okay.

13:51.214 --> 13:52.547
Well, you obviously have
an opinion.

13:52.549 --> 13:54.549
Why don't you quit saying okay,
like a fucking retard

13:54.551 --> 13:56.551
and spit it out?

13:56.553 --> 13:58.386
Okay.

13:58.388 --> 14:00.221
I don't know.
I mean, Dante Valerio,

14:00.223 --> 14:02.641
he's a mega-successful
billionaire, right?

14:02.693 --> 14:05.060
He's been with Gage
since the start...

14:05.062 --> 14:07.479
nobody knows his fucking name.

14:07.531 --> 14:09.864
I mean, all he ever hears
about is what a genius

14:09.900 --> 14:12.484
Ellis Hightower is.
Well...

14:12.536 --> 14:14.903
Eh, you know, you're
probably right, I mean...

14:14.905 --> 14:17.906
why would a guy like
Dante Valerio want to install

14:17.908 --> 14:21.242
an unthreatening,
low-profile CEO

14:21.244 --> 14:23.712
when he's got you?

14:31.555 --> 14:35.090
You know, when I spent $200,000
on business school,

14:35.092 --> 14:37.842
this is exactly
what I had in mind.

14:37.894 --> 14:40.345
Oh, my God,
have I thanked you yet?

14:40.397 --> 14:42.814
Jeannie, if I haven't, thank you
so much for supplying me

14:42.849 --> 14:45.183
with this priceless
life opportunity.

14:45.235 --> 14:46.735
I finished organizing the closet
Uh-huh.

14:46.770 --> 14:48.853
And made a pile for Goodwill. Um...
Okay.

14:48.905 --> 14:51.189
Oh, and I need you home by 7:00
because I'm making lamb chops.

14:51.241 --> 14:53.575
Lamb chops? Really?
Yeah. But I got them

14:53.610 --> 14:55.610
at the store that sells food
past the sell-by date.

14:55.612 --> 14:57.746
#IKnowMyHusband.

14:57.781 --> 14:59.864
Okay. Great. Well...

14:59.916 --> 15:03.918
I'll see you at 7:00.
#IGotPlansForYouAfterDinner.

15:03.954 --> 15:05.003
Ooh!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.621
#NotOvulating.

15:06.623 --> 15:08.790
#FinishWhereverYouWant.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.959
Hashtag...

15:11.011 --> 15:12.961
I gotta go. All right.
I love you, Sarah.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.929
I love you, too.
Bye.

15:14.965 --> 15:17.932
Whoa, so, when I was out there,
I did a little ground recon.

15:17.968 --> 15:21.136
No sign of the target, so...
This isn't a fucking stakeout, Doug.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.388
So, let's, uh, recon. Oh, yeah, right.
All right. Let's just sit here

15:23.440 --> 15:25.640
and scowl at each other.
God forgive me for trying

15:25.692 --> 15:27.475
to inject a little fun
into the proceedings.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.477
How is any of this
supposed to be fun?

15:29.529 --> 15:32.313
Are you k... Have you even tried
the binoculars?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.816
Look at them. They zoom. Give it a shot.
Put it down!

15:34.868 --> 15:37.952
Okay. Your loss. - You know, I don't even
now why I'm lashing out on you.

15:37.988 --> 15:39.654
None of this
is your fuckin' fault.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.490
Things seem to be good with
you and Sarah, huh, Doug?

15:42.492 --> 15:44.659
Yeah, yeah, you know,
Sarah losing her job

15:44.711 --> 15:46.461
has actually been a blessing
in disguise.

15:46.496 --> 15:49.464
She's been around and attentive
and relaxed.

15:49.499 --> 15:51.299
It's nice.
Great. I'm happy for you.

15:51.334 --> 15:52.667
Jeannie, can I actually
see your coffee?

15:52.669 --> 15:53.835
I think you have mine.

15:57.007 --> 15:57.972
No, this one was yours.

15:58.008 --> 15:59.369
The whole time,
this one was yours.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.176
I don't even know why I took it.
Oh, that's mature.

16:01.228 --> 16:05.346
I mean, not as mature as bringing
down your company and sending

16:05.398 --> 16:06.848
your partner to prison,
but I feel like it's good.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.149
I am so sick of your attitude.

16:08.185 --> 16:10.351
If working for me is such
an unspeakable misery,

16:10.353 --> 16:11.686
get another job.

16:11.688 --> 16:12.937
Oh, see, that's just the thing.

16:12.989 --> 16:14.606
I've tried and I can't.

16:14.658 --> 16:16.941
Now, Jeannie,
why do you think that is?

16:16.993 --> 16:20.028
I don't know. You're such a rock star.
Right.

16:20.030 --> 16:22.530
I'm shocked that every company
in the world aren't falling

16:22.532 --> 16:25.116
all over themselves
to put you on board.

16:25.168 --> 16:27.118
At least before you ruined
Marty's life,

16:27.170 --> 16:28.837
- he got to fuck you.
- Whoa.

16:28.872 --> 16:30.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second.

16:30.674 --> 16:32.340
Calm down. So what do we
think is a fair exchange then,

16:32.375 --> 16:33.541
for me having caused such damage

16:33.593 --> 16:35.376
to your stellar reputation?
I don't know.

16:35.378 --> 16:37.712
Is it... I mean, would it be,
like, an under-the-bra tit grab?

16:37.714 --> 16:40.882
We could... A stinky pinky?
I know you like those.

16:40.884 --> 16:42.634
You know what, I'll be generous.

16:42.686 --> 16:45.470
I will give you
a big, fat, juicy blow job

16:45.522 --> 16:48.306
if you would
just shut the fuck up

16:48.358 --> 16:51.059
and stop being such
a whiny little bitch about it.

16:51.061 --> 16:52.477
Okay, so I'm a whiny little bitch?
Yeah.

16:52.529 --> 16:54.395
Whiny little bitches
look at you and they go,

16:54.397 --> 16:56.397
"Ew, what a whiny little bitch."
You know, fuck you.

16:56.399 --> 16:57.899
- Fuck you.
- Eh, uh,

16:57.951 --> 16:59.734
I'm sorry,
um, if I could just...

16:59.786 --> 17:01.986
I-I'm pretty sure you weren't
being serious before,

17:02.038 --> 17:03.655
but I've also suffered
some damage

17:03.707 --> 17:05.490
to my reputation, so... What?
There they are.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.375
Oh, sh... Okay,
the rooster is in the nest.

17:07.410 --> 17:09.410
Repeat, the rooster
is in the nest.

17:14.885 --> 17:17.502
You've got quite a reputation.

17:17.554 --> 17:19.087
Oh, you asked about me.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.723
Wow, I feel like
such a pretty girl.

17:21.758 --> 17:25.093
I don't know how you knew,
but you knew.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.762
Dante Valerio's taking
the temperature

17:27.814 --> 17:29.898
of the other board members
about making a change.

17:29.933 --> 17:31.099
Imagine that.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.902
A fucking retard figured
that out before you.

17:33.937 --> 17:35.904
You can go out
the same way you came in, buddy.

17:37.274 --> 17:39.240
Is that your big close?

17:39.276 --> 17:41.609
The illustrious Marty Kaan sulks

17:41.611 --> 17:43.361
because I called him a name.
And then what?

17:43.413 --> 17:45.780
I-I hire him
out of guilt?

17:45.782 --> 17:47.949
Yeah, that's it.
You-you figured me out.

17:50.453 --> 17:53.872
Okay. I'm sorry, Marty,
for calling you a name.

17:53.924 --> 17:57.041
Okay?
I'm sorry.

17:57.093 --> 17:59.794
Now, will you help me fight my
way out of this pit of vipers?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.630
You don't hear
the word "no" a lot,

18:02.682 --> 18:05.466
- do you? - I only hear it when someone's
negotiating for higher fees,

18:05.518 --> 18:07.135
so, if this is
a question of money...

18:07.137 --> 18:09.387
Ellis, fuck, listen.

18:09.439 --> 18:12.724
My illustrious consulting career
landed me

18:12.776 --> 18:14.726
in this five-star shit hole.

18:14.778 --> 18:16.811
So forgive me if I don't jump
right back in

18:16.863 --> 18:18.184
because yet another
rich asshole's

18:18.198 --> 18:19.230
house is on fire.

18:19.282 --> 18:20.481
Whoa. Okay.

18:20.483 --> 18:21.983
My time here

18:22.035 --> 18:24.452
is about me trying to make
sense out of my future,

18:24.487 --> 18:26.654
not yours.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.489
I jump back in when I'm ready,
if I'm ready.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.625
So no consult for you.

18:30.660 --> 18:34.329
Because you're on some
masturbatory quest for Satori. - Look,

18:34.381 --> 18:36.497
hit me up in a couple months,
okay? I'll see how I feel.

18:36.499 --> 18:38.333
Well, in a few months,
I'll be worm food.

18:38.335 --> 18:40.501
- I was thinking about going to the...
- I don't give a fuck.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.086
Hi.

18:42.138 --> 18:43.338
Can you give us a minute?
We're in the middle of something.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.422
No, no, no.

18:44.474 --> 18:45.340
We're done.
You can come in.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.342
Do you mind, Gabe?

18:47.394 --> 18:50.979
He knows my name.

18:55.852 --> 18:57.852
Marty, I'm not gonna beg.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.356
Good. Then I can get back
to my book.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.692
This is weird.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.330
We have a meeting at Somerset Software.
Oh, what an amazing

19:09.366 --> 19:11.366
coincidence.
Yeah. Or is it fate?

19:11.368 --> 19:13.034
I was just telling
Andrew here that we saw

19:13.086 --> 19:14.286
some interesting flex potential

19:14.337 --> 19:16.704
for Celetech. Here we are
running into each other.

19:16.706 --> 19:18.339
I'm Jeannie van der Hooven.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.675
A very ambitious consultant
from Kaan & Associates.

19:20.710 --> 19:24.012
Ah. I understand your firm's
been through a rough patch.

19:24.047 --> 19:25.880
Well, bowed but not broken, sir.

19:25.882 --> 19:27.882
As you can see.

19:27.884 --> 19:30.218
And willing to work

19:30.270 --> 19:31.886
on a performance-tied
fee structure.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.055
You know, our experience
suggests that Celetech can

19:34.107 --> 19:35.690
maintain a science-based true
north while still adding to...

19:35.725 --> 19:37.392
Okay, I'm gonna
cut you off there.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.227
We've been with
Demark for years.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.728
And I'm not
gonna be dropping them

19:40.780 --> 19:43.698
just so I can go into
business with Marty Kaan.

19:43.733 --> 19:44.866
Well, you wouldn't be.

19:44.901 --> 19:46.818
Marty is no longer
a part of the company.

19:46.870 --> 19:48.870
In any case.

19:48.905 --> 19:50.405
You know...

19:50.457 --> 19:52.490
for a billionaire,
you're kind of a dumb shit.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.325
- Whoa.
- Whoa, Jeannie.

19:54.377 --> 19:56.411
It's fine-- they're not
gonna hire us anyway.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.629
I'm so tired of
kissing the ass of all these

19:58.665 --> 20:00.415
potential clients
who are total dumb shits.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.083
Can I close my door, please?

20:02.135 --> 20:03.718
Did you know we were a thing?

20:03.753 --> 20:06.421
Marty and I. Briefly.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.172
I fucked it up.

20:08.224 --> 20:09.757
And for a while,
I spent all my time

20:09.759 --> 20:11.259
trying to figure out
a way to make it right.

20:11.261 --> 20:12.894
Jeannie, you're
embarrassing yourself.

20:12.929 --> 20:15.179
Until one day, I thought:

20:15.231 --> 20:16.931
Wait a minute, why?

20:16.933 --> 20:20.401
Why am I pushing up
against this rock?

20:20.437 --> 20:22.937
'Cause it certainly wasn't
good for me professionally.

20:22.939 --> 20:24.522
And, you know,
Marty taught me a lot,

20:24.574 --> 20:26.240
he helped make me who I am.

20:26.276 --> 20:28.776
But even setting aside the
impact that a prison record

20:28.778 --> 20:32.113
would have on his future
prospects, I'd just gone

20:32.165 --> 20:34.615
as far as I could go with him.

20:34.617 --> 20:36.701
It made sense for me
to leave Marty behind.

20:36.753 --> 20:38.369
And that was someone I loved.

20:38.421 --> 20:40.288
Because I understand

20:40.340 --> 20:42.290
that in order to get ahead
and stay ahead,

20:42.342 --> 20:44.792
you have to cut ties.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.629
So I'm a dumb shit because
I won't cut ties with Demark?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.882
Wow, you must have
a big brain for science,

20:50.934 --> 20:53.217
because your people sense
isn't exactly top-notch.

20:53.269 --> 20:55.470
And you hired
a chief financial officer

20:55.522 --> 20:58.056
who cheated his way
through business school.

20:58.108 --> 20:59.524
Though I suppose

20:59.559 --> 21:00.641
you can't be blamed

21:00.693 --> 21:02.226
for not digging through
the official records

21:02.278 --> 21:04.112
of the Columbia University
judicial board.

21:04.147 --> 21:05.646
They were never able to prove...

21:05.698 --> 21:08.983
But even when someone's
profligacy and petulance

21:09.035 --> 21:12.487
is draining money from your
pocket, you still don't see it.

21:12.489 --> 21:14.956
Or maybe you do.

21:14.991 --> 21:17.492
And maybe you still
stubbornly insist on being

21:17.494 --> 21:19.460
Ellis Hightower's
slobbery lapdog

21:19.496 --> 21:21.829
because he's just such a genius.

21:21.831 --> 21:24.832
You're not a dumb shit
because you won't cut ties

21:24.884 --> 21:26.417
with Demark.

21:26.469 --> 21:28.169
You're a dumb shit
because you won't

21:28.221 --> 21:29.971
cut ties with anyone.

21:30.006 --> 21:31.973
Have a nice day.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.188
Not bad, Jeannie.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.690
Not bad.

21:49.692 --> 21:51.359
Oh, it'll be fucking beautiful.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.361
Living in a Van Nuys
apartment complex,

21:53.413 --> 21:54.996
swapping stories
with your 60-year-old

21:55.031 --> 21:56.831
actor neighbor who came

21:56.866 --> 21:59.784
this close to getting
a Doritos commercial in 1988.

21:59.836 --> 22:01.702
And you can tell him about
the time you traded in your

22:01.754 --> 22:03.538
bespoke suits for a closet
full of Hawaiian shirts

22:03.540 --> 22:05.840
while you led a fruitless search

22:05.875 --> 22:07.542
for the meaning of life,

22:07.594 --> 22:10.628
only to realize too late
that the meaning of life--

22:10.680 --> 22:14.048
the chance to be a foot soldier
in <i> the</i> revolution

22:14.100 --> 22:16.050
of our time-- was staring you right
Yeah, okay.

22:16.052 --> 22:18.719
in the fucking face.
El-Ellis. Okay. Okay.

22:18.721 --> 22:20.521
I get it. Uncle.

22:20.557 --> 22:22.557
Okay.
Okay.

22:24.894 --> 22:26.360
Okay.

22:32.902 --> 22:34.569
I don't know, I...

22:34.621 --> 22:37.071
It would just be
so much easier if...

22:37.123 --> 22:39.486
if she were dead, you know?

22:39.606 --> 22:42.550
Nice. Fantastic. No, I mean... I
don't mean I wish she were dead.

22:42.670 --> 22:43.585
That's a different thing.
I, it's...

22:43.705 --> 22:44.871
I love Sarah. You know that.
I've always loved Sarah.

22:44.991 --> 22:45.982
Right, right, right.

22:46.102 --> 22:46.914
But if she was dead, man,

22:46.916 --> 22:48.916
think about all that
widower pussy you would get.

22:48.918 --> 22:50.585
What? Pardon me?
God, you make...

22:50.587 --> 22:51.836
you make it sound sick.
Doug...

22:51.888 --> 22:53.337
you know, in Judaism,
there's this thing

22:53.389 --> 22:54.922
called the <i> Chamesh Godol.</i>

22:54.924 --> 22:57.592
It loosely translates
to "Shiva House blow job."

22:57.644 --> 23:00.595
Now, it's considered a mitzvah
when a woman provides oral sex

23:00.647 --> 23:02.513
to a man whose wife
just passed away.

23:03.312 --> 23:04.849
Really?
No. What the fuck

23:04.901 --> 23:07.867
is wrong with you? Really?
You were thinking about it.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.353
How many people you think
want to hear

23:09.405 --> 23:10.855
this fucking conversation?
You know how much

23:10.907 --> 23:12.823
I like blow jobs.
That's not...Listen, I'm not the one asking

23:12.859 --> 23:14.775
for a co-worker's baby
on behalf of a wife

23:14.827 --> 23:16.986
who I wish were dead, so I feel fucking amazing
right now.

23:17.235 --> 23:18.661
No, out of context, Clyde.

23:18.781 --> 23:19.947
Out of context?
Oh, you need to go now?

23:19.949 --> 23:20.948
I... I wish you would...
That's what I'm saying.

23:20.950 --> 23:22.450
Go, go, go.
Excuse me.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.168
I have to go to the bathroom.
Just move by. Just go by.

23:24.204 --> 23:25.786
Fine, I'm doing it.
Be a man. Go by.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.088
Will?

23:27.123 --> 23:29.757
Hey.

23:29.792 --> 23:31.292
Hey.
 It is you. Get over here.

23:31.344 --> 23:32.760
Good to see you.

23:32.795 --> 23:34.128
Guys, it's Will.

23:34.130 --> 23:35.630
Who gives a shit?

23:35.682 --> 23:36.797
Good to see you too, Clyde.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.799
Well, look at you, huh?
Fancypants.

23:38.801 --> 23:40.885
It looks like you
found life after K&A.

23:40.937 --> 23:41.886
Where'd you end up?

23:41.938 --> 23:43.221
Uh, it's not that...

23:43.273 --> 23:44.639
Come on.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.057
I'm at ...I'm at Demark.

23:46.109 --> 23:47.892
- Demark. Sure.
- Demark. I feel like I was

23:47.944 --> 23:49.424
just talking about that.
Clyde, who...

23:49.445 --> 23:50.811
- Didn't someone else just end up there?
Uh-huh.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.813
Who was that?
It's probably Monica.

23:52.815 --> 23:55.650
She's the one who hired me.
You know, coming from

23:55.652 --> 23:57.735
K&A, it wasn't easy
getting new work,

23:57.787 --> 23:59.987
and I had already worked with
her, so I just... William...

23:59.989 --> 24:01.656
Oh, God.
What did I tell you about fraternizing

24:01.658 --> 24:03.791
with the enemy?

24:03.826 --> 24:05.576
I'm just kidding.

24:05.628 --> 24:07.495
I'm just kidding.

24:07.497 --> 24:10.414
As if a rapidly shrinking speck
in the consulting universe

24:10.466 --> 24:13.467
like Kaan & Associates could
ever be considered an enemy.

24:13.503 --> 24:15.636
Well, I mean, even
a single-celled parasite

24:15.672 --> 24:17.388
can take down a lion.

24:17.423 --> 24:18.889
Strong rebuttal.
Thank you.

24:18.925 --> 24:19.974
Ugh.

24:20.009 --> 24:21.509
Hi, Marty.

24:21.511 --> 24:24.645
Whoa, hey, Fatso.
So where

24:24.681 --> 24:26.264
you guys headed
on this glorious day?

24:26.316 --> 24:28.015
Oh, I'm just

24:28.017 --> 24:29.817
taking the kids to Napa,
you know,

24:29.852 --> 24:31.485
so we can sample
the season's new rosés.

24:31.521 --> 24:33.321
Mm. I know you're
going to Gage.

24:33.356 --> 24:34.822
Dante Valerio's a client.

24:34.857 --> 24:36.991
But don't worry, I am
headed to an unrelated

24:37.026 --> 24:39.777
consult, because I am
not a cruel person.

24:39.829 --> 24:42.863
And it would be cruel
to steal your one big fish.

24:42.865 --> 24:44.615
Even after how hard
you fucked me over

24:44.667 --> 24:46.617
last year.
What? No.

24:46.669 --> 24:49.036
- That was an accident.
- Oops.

24:49.088 --> 24:52.173
You know, a lot of men would
have just laid down and died

24:52.208 --> 24:53.374
in your situation,

24:53.426 --> 24:55.176
but you really seized
that moment, didn't you?

24:55.211 --> 24:57.795
I even heard a rumor
that you had your lawyer

24:57.847 --> 25:00.014
petition the board
of prisons to get you

25:00.049 --> 25:01.716
sent to Worthy when you could have
Come on.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.217
landed somewhere more cush,

25:03.269 --> 25:05.853
just to get close to Hightower.

25:07.223 --> 25:08.856
So what if I did?
Mm-hmm.

25:08.891 --> 25:11.392
And I heard you took
a load in the face

25:11.444 --> 25:14.312
from Dante Valerio in the
parking lot of Celetech.

25:14.364 --> 25:16.564
Ooh, ugh. I started

25:16.616 --> 25:18.566
that one. But the fact that
a lot I don't give a fuck.

25:18.568 --> 25:20.151
of people are believing it--

25:20.203 --> 25:22.036
that should come
as a warning sign to you.

25:22.071 --> 25:24.488
Yeah, I didn't believe it, but I...
William...

25:24.540 --> 25:26.123
I should just...
I'll go...

25:27.627 --> 25:29.210
Hey, Jeannie,

25:29.245 --> 25:30.711
how's Edwin?

25:30.747 --> 25:32.580
He's fine.
Yeah?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.048
Mm-hmm.
I can't wait to

25:34.083 --> 25:36.584
meet him.
The father of your child.

25:36.586 --> 25:38.803
Aah!

25:38.838 --> 25:40.254
Where did you say
he worked again?

25:40.256 --> 25:42.390
Skadden Arps.

25:42.425 --> 25:44.091
Skadden Arps, that's right.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.344
I do a lot of business
with Skadden Arps.

25:46.396 --> 25:48.729
I should look him up
next time I'm in New York.

25:48.765 --> 25:51.265
I will be sure to warn him.

25:54.103 --> 25:56.070
So this is coach, huh?

25:56.105 --> 25:57.154
Charming.

25:57.190 --> 25:59.190
Bye, Mo.

25:59.242 --> 26:01.242
Oh, bye.

26:02.912 --> 26:05.913
She was hitting that Edwin
shit pretty hard, right?

26:05.948 --> 26:07.915
What was that about?
Yeah, well, it's Monica, so,

26:07.950 --> 26:10.751
I mean, what could
we... expect?

26:10.787 --> 26:12.787
Okay.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.463
I'm not an honest person, Marty.

26:22.465 --> 26:24.215
You're... you're right.

26:24.267 --> 26:27.301
Because when a situation
feels difficult or complicated,

26:27.303 --> 26:29.553
even though I know, objectively,

26:29.605 --> 26:31.222
that the lie
will exacerbate things,

26:31.274 --> 26:34.809
I... I always seem
to choose to lie.

26:34.811 --> 26:36.977
Eh, it's...
And...

26:37.029 --> 26:39.313
I need to tell you
something serious,

26:39.315 --> 26:42.149
and I need you to believe me,

26:42.201 --> 26:44.568
or you don't...

26:44.620 --> 26:46.620
have to, I don't know.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.990
I just...
I want you to know that

26:50.042 --> 26:54.128
I never intended to leave you...

26:54.163 --> 26:56.747
W... We were just in a th...

26:56.799 --> 26:58.799
of... I... and I panicked.

27:01.337 --> 27:04.171
And I... said Edwin.

27:07.643 --> 27:10.177
And then I waited, and...

27:10.229 --> 27:12.430
there wasn't a right time,

27:12.482 --> 27:15.850
or at least, it wasn't the time

27:15.902 --> 27:17.351
that I wanted it to be.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.403
It's yours.

27:30.533 --> 27:31.999
Okay...

27:32.034 --> 27:33.534
Hey, so,

27:33.536 --> 27:35.836
uh, listen, I actually
did a little recon here,

27:35.872 --> 27:37.371
and turns out Monica is in fact

27:37.423 --> 27:40.875
headed to an unrelated
consult, so...  phew.

27:40.877 --> 27:44.879
Yeah. Phew.

27:44.881 --> 27:47.515
Yeah.

27:47.550 --> 27:50.518
? What'll it be, now ?

27:50.553 --> 27:53.304
? Mr. Moe ?

27:53.356 --> 27:56.140
? Whisper slow within ?

27:56.192 --> 27:58.559
? Curls of smoke ?

27:58.611 --> 28:01.312
? Take a back seat ?

28:01.364 --> 28:03.731
? Or play fair on ?

28:03.851 --> 28:14.014
