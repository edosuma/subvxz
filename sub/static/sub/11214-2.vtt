WEBVTT

00:32.300 --> 00:34.702
(baby crying)

00:34.702 --> 00:36.904
WOMAN:
Can you remove
the clothes?

00:36.904 --> 00:39.207
I need to take a
picture of his body.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.611
(baby crying)

00:48.849 --> 00:50.784
(crying continues)

00:55.623 --> 00:57.625
MAN:
Detective Lydia Adams,

00:57.625 --> 01:00.561
at the end of a very long day,
had to give up a baby.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.296
It wasn't the first time.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.564
You know what
a Mozambique is?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.166
BEN:
Uh, Failure drill, right?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.201
Two the body,
one to the head?
Yeah.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.669
Used to be called
the Mozambique.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.772
PC crap-- nothing can
be called what it is.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.941
You know why they call it
the Mozambique?

01:13.941 --> 01:15.509
Nah.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.411
Those crazy revolutionary
dudes over there

01:17.411 --> 01:19.447
used to chew this drug
called "khat."

01:19.447 --> 01:20.848
Mm-hmm.
Hits the nervous system.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.250
It's like amphetamine.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.185
You chew the leaves,
you're impervious.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.519
Hey, hey!
Hey.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.887
I told my wife
about you.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.888
Good job, son.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.223
(chuckles)
Thank you.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.292
Dewey's an asshole,
but he's one of us.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.293
Yeah. All right.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.561
Thanks.
Have a good one.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.595
Yeah.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.165
All right, anyway,
1974-- this soldier,

01:37.165 --> 01:38.366
he's defending the
airport there, right?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.633
Got a sidearm.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.569
This khat-chewing
crazy-ass fucker,

01:41.569 --> 01:43.971
he comes running at him
with an AK-47, firing bullets.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.374
They were just spraying
bullets everywhere.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.708
He's missing him, right?
Yeah.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.477
So the soldier fires two
to the center mass.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.911
The khat-chewin' bastard,
he doesn't feel it.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.381
They don't put you up
for the Medal for this,

01:53.381 --> 01:54.348
something's wrong.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.916
(laughs)
Thank you.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.519
JOHN: Yeah. For the whole
30 seconds he's been on the job,

01:58.519 --> 02:01.722
he definitely deserves
the Medal of Valor.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.090
You done us proud.
Thank you.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.725
CHICKIE: Six-eight-47,
show us clear.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.861
So, after the double-tap,
soldier fires one to the head--

02:07.861 --> 02:08.962
right between the eyes.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.431
You know why?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.166
Yeah, there's no bone
to deflect the bullet.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.735
Bang! He goes down.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.271
So, seriously--
where'd you learn to shoot?

02:17.271 --> 02:18.172
Beverly Hills Gun Club.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.807
Thought you knew.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.842
You're fucking with me.
CHICKIE:
I don't think so.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.044
Get in the back, Spago.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.180
Sorry.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.298
(dog barking)

02:44.298 --> 02:46.734
I think your wife's
been blogging my wife.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.970
She's been getting
all pissy with me suddenly.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.541
(barking continues)

02:53.541 --> 02:55.075
I'm gonna kill that
fucking dog.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.877
(barking continues)

02:58.479 --> 03:00.914
MAN (slurring):
He owes me money...
ANDY: Okay.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.350
and he said he wasn't,

03:02.350 --> 03:05.819
he said he wasn't gonna
pay me back, no, sir.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.754
That's not right at all.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.722
ANDY: How much money
he owe you, sir?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.324
How much does
he owe you, sir?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.059
Three dollars.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.527
Are you kidding me?
Three dollars?

03:13.527 --> 03:14.762
That's what he owes you?

03:14.762 --> 03:17.665
You're missing
the point here.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.867
He said he wasn't
gonna pay me back!

03:19.867 --> 03:21.001
This is
a bad economy.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.803
All right.
We're done here.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.738
Uh, guy says he did it;
we have witnesses.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.939
It's a ground ball.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.075
Kenny and I will--
we'll wait for S.I.D.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.042
KENNY:
We're good. Go ahead.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.278
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.645
Sammy, you need
a ride back?
Yeah.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.646
Janila?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.516
Sweetheart,
what are you doing?

03:35.516 --> 03:37.885
I live down the street.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.152
Really?

03:39.152 --> 03:40.721
Yeah.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.923
They haven't
moved you yet?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.024
No.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.159
(sighs)

03:46.159 --> 03:47.728
(clears throat)
So how are you?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.497
Okay.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.699
I heard
from this boy at our school

03:51.699 --> 03:53.734
that you guys, like,
have junior police kids

03:53.734 --> 03:54.702
work for y'all.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.037
What we have
is the Explorers program.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.007
And, actually,
Detective Moretta helps run it.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.108
Remember him?

04:01.108 --> 04:02.476
Hi.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.445
You want to be
an Explorer?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.246
What all does
it consist of?

04:06.246 --> 04:08.048
Well, it's, uh, it's
basically for kids

04:08.048 --> 04:10.318
who think they might want
to go into law enforcement.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.985
We'll meet up once a week;
we train you;

04:11.985 --> 04:14.254
you'll move through the ranks,
just like in the academy,

04:14.254 --> 04:15.923
and, uh, you get
to train other kids.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.924
I'll join.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.258
(detectives chuckling)

04:18.258 --> 04:20.060
NATE:
That was easy.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.162
SAMMY:
You know, you're already
helping us out by testifying.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.331
You know that, right?
Yeah.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.698
But it's very important

04:24.698 --> 04:26.734
that you don't go
telling people about it.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.302
Remember?
We talked about that.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.805
So, what are you gonna
say about Dewey?

04:31.805 --> 04:36.944
I know it's really weird...
I kinda like the guy.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.012
He's kind of a turd.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.148
(Chickie laughs)

04:41.148 --> 04:43.451
Whoa! Whoa!
211 in progress!

04:43.451 --> 04:45.886
Gun! Gun!

04:45.886 --> 04:47.788
(tires screech)

04:47.788 --> 04:49.990
JOHN: Hey, hey, wait!
Hey! Where you going?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.693
(man shouting
in Arabic inside)

04:58.766 --> 05:01.435
(shouting in Arabic
continues)

05:02.570 --> 05:04.872
(panting rapidly)

05:05.873 --> 05:06.740
Drop the gun!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.709
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun now!

05:08.709 --> 05:10.010
(shouting in Arabic continues)
Drop the gun!

05:10.010 --> 05:12.480
Drop the gun! Drop the gun
or I will shoot you!

05:12.480 --> 05:13.514
(shouting continues)
Drop the gun!

05:13.514 --> 05:15.383
Put it down!

05:15.383 --> 05:16.950
Put it down! Turn around!

05:16.950 --> 05:18.786
Turn around,
put your hands on the glass!

05:18.786 --> 05:21.655
(man speaking Arabic)
Hands on the case!
Hands on the case!

05:21.655 --> 05:22.656
Shut up!

05:22.656 --> 05:24.024
(man speaking Arabic)

05:24.024 --> 05:25.258
You! Outside now!

05:25.258 --> 05:27.027
Go! Go!

05:27.027 --> 05:29.830
(man shouting in Arabic)
Go now! Shut up!

05:29.830 --> 05:32.032
Shut up! Shut up now!
Shut up!

05:32.032 --> 05:35.035
Down. Stay down!

05:35.035 --> 05:38.406
(speaking Arabic)

05:38.406 --> 05:40.007
Shut up. Shut up!

05:42.643 --> 05:44.678
(speaking Arabic)
Yeah, shut up.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.483
About a hundred things
you did wrong.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.486
This man,
he works at this market.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.721
He was being robbed
by this gentleman,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.556
who may or may not
have a gun.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.124
Do you have a gun, sir?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.959
Dude got it off me.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.060
Yeah.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.462
You may be a great shot,

06:01.462 --> 06:03.864
but you still know shit
about being a cop.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.733
CHICKIE:
Sit up. Sit up!

06:05.733 --> 06:09.470
Number one: things aren't
always what they seem.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.571
CHICKIE:
Sit up.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.739
The victim can be
the suspect;

06:11.739 --> 06:13.541
suspect can be the victim.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.708
Unhook him.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.812
Number two:
you wait for us.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.481
You do not take
action by yourself.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.949
Yes, sir.
We work as partners.

06:21.949 --> 06:22.916
Yes, sir.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.285
Now you apologize to him.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.954
I'm very sorry, sir.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.956
You okay?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.223
He's new.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.492
You get his info.
Yes, sir.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.793
CHICKIE:
Let's go.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.629
(car alarm wailing in distance)

06:44.037 --> 06:45.038
Move over.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.674
Move over!

06:46.674 --> 06:48.776
Come on. That's good.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.746
CHICKIE:
Six-eight-47,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.583
show us en route
to the station with
one in custody.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.784
DISPATCH (over radio):
Six-eight-47, copy.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.386
Got caught up in the
John Wayne syndrome.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.855
You lost your position
of advantage.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.156
Yes, sir.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.693
Could've been a second,
third suspect.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.761
Could've been a layoff man
waiting to shoot at you.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.498
John... John!
Stop the car!

07:10.498 --> 07:12.032
(tires screech)

07:12.032 --> 07:12.833
(horns blare)

07:12.833 --> 07:14.602
JOHN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:14.602 --> 07:15.769
Hold it! Stop!

07:15.769 --> 07:18.105
JOHN:
Stop!
Okay. Hi.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.172
JOHN:
I got it.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.474
What the heck?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.213
(horns honking)

07:31.018 --> 07:32.085
(baby fussing)

07:32.085 --> 07:33.587
LYDIA:
Hey, there...

07:33.587 --> 07:35.155
(baby fusses)

07:35.155 --> 07:38.325
I don't know, maybe the mom
ran to the store or something,

07:38.325 --> 07:40.928
got picked up; didn't tell
the cops about the baby?

07:40.928 --> 07:43.764
RUSSELL:
Maybe it was a carjacking.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.799
They look in the backseat,
they see the baby,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.835
and they freak out
and they dump it...

07:47.835 --> 07:50.604
Or maybe God
dropped it down.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.106
You know, from Heaven.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.342
We're gonna stay here
and keep canvassing the area.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.444
RUSSELL:
Let us know if you
have any answers,

07:57.444 --> 07:59.580
and we'll call
Media Relations.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.615
Thank you.
All right.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.688
Oh, man, Russell,
we didn't bring a car seat.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.990
It's four blocks.
You can just hold him.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.793
Look, just, you know,

08:12.793 --> 08:16.096
sit in the backseat,
I'll drive real slow.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.599
Promise.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.600
Okay.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.635
He's a big man.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.503
Handsome little man.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.772
Isn't he?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.840
Let's go for a ride.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.543
SAMMY:
This is our star witness
in a gang trial.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.911
When was
the last time you had

08:30.911 --> 08:32.479
a witness come forward
like this, huh?

08:32.479 --> 08:33.981
Detective...
How about never?

08:33.981 --> 08:35.783
There's a budget crisis.
Maybe you've noticed?

08:35.783 --> 08:37.284
Okay? I'm sorry, we're
not relocating them.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.619
This is bullshit.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.087
No, they're Hispanic
gang members.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.589
She doesn't even live
in their neighborhood.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.890
I don't see
the threat here.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.157
Hello? They have
these things called cars.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.693
Yeah, and so they're
gonna go across town

08:45.693 --> 08:46.860
and try to find her
in a black neighborhood.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.361
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.998
No, I don't think so.
I'm late for court.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.703
(sighs)

08:56.770 --> 08:58.639
Just get her
into the Explorers.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.840
You know she has
to apply, right?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.374
I know, but no
bullshit.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.243
I don't care
if she's got D's in school.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.645
Just let her in.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.513
Don't worry about it, man.
She's in.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.583
Hey, does my ass
look big in these?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.384
RUSSELL:
Okay, that was DCFS.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.320
They're sending over
an emergency response worker.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.556
(baby crying)
Media Relations hasn't even
put out a bulletin.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.891
And you know what's
gonna happen--

09:17.891 --> 09:19.927
they're just gonna
dump him in the system,

09:19.927 --> 09:22.495
just like they do
with all of the other cases.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.298
(baby crying)

09:25.298 --> 09:28.201
LYDIA: Hey, buddy, let's
get this diaper changed.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.570
(crying)
Come on...

09:35.709 --> 09:37.244
(crying stops)

09:39.012 --> 09:41.682
(gently):
Ooh...
Man!
What the hell!

09:41.682 --> 09:43.651
(baby crying)

09:43.651 --> 09:45.585
LYDIA (gently):
Okay. Okay.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.155
Okay. Okay.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.692
Ooh-wee!
A big load right there!

09:52.693 --> 09:54.427
Russ...
Yeah.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.163
Look at this.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.099
FEMALE REPORTER:
Today, in the Southland,

09:59.099 --> 10:02.169
a baby boy believed
to be about ten months old,

10:02.169 --> 10:05.305
was found crawling
across this street in Hollywood,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.841
according to
the Los Angeles Police.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.078
Let me try that
one more time.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.313
Hey! Anything else
you can tell me?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.715
Nope.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.784
MAN:
Officer! Officer...

10:16.784 --> 10:19.119
Is that baby okay?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.654
Yeah, it's fine.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.457
How you doing, shitbird?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.193
I'm a little high right now.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.027
Yeah?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.128
(both laughing)
Yeah.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.463
So, uh, anything
you can tell me?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.799
Maybe drug deal
gone bad?

10:31.799 --> 10:33.366
Somebody tried
to sell the kid?

10:33.366 --> 10:34.367
Something like that?

10:34.367 --> 10:35.502
No?

10:35.502 --> 10:36.804
Yeah?
No.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.106
Okay. All right.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.508
Thanks.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.411
Hey, I just got off the phone
with, uh, Riverside.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.679
There've got a mother who filed

10:45.679 --> 10:47.815
a missing baby report
two days ago.

10:47.815 --> 10:51.451
So she's coming over here
to see if it's hers.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.920
What?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.622
Well, she might have done
something to her kid,

10:55.622 --> 10:57.290
'cause her story's
kind of hinky.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.893
And we're supposed to just
hand this baby to her?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.461
Come on, Lyd.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.630
What if it's
really her kid?

11:03.630 --> 11:06.266
So, uh, about Dewey's party...

11:06.266 --> 11:08.869
Wait, w-why do I have
to go to this thing?

11:08.869 --> 11:09.837
N-Nobody liked him, right?

11:09.837 --> 11:11.404
I never even met the guy.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.775
It's a chance for you
to meet some of my friends.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.710
Oh, y-you mean the wives?

11:16.710 --> 11:18.478
Yeah, what's wrong
with that? Huh?

11:18.478 --> 11:20.781
I-I have nothing in common
with these women!

11:20.781 --> 11:21.749
Nothing!

11:21.749 --> 11:22.750
You don't know that.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.117
They probably all belong to

11:24.117 --> 11:26.119
a nice little book club,
read Ann Rice novels.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.921
You're being ridiculous, Tammi.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.057
I found this guy.

11:30.057 --> 11:34.527
Um, he's a retired cop
out in Thousand Oaks.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.164
And he said he'd meet us there,
take Richter.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.500
Tammi,

11:40.500 --> 11:41.902
it's better for the dog.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.670
He can run around,
work off that energy.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.405
Fine.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.108
He's my only friend, and you
want to take him away from me.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.477
You know that this is
the right thing for him.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.345
The guy has goats.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.413
He can herd goats.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.815
(scoffs)

11:54.815 --> 11:56.950
Tam...

11:58.718 --> 12:02.155
You honestly think it's
a good idea if she comes?

12:02.155 --> 12:03.656
No.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.958
She's gonna
freak, bro.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.526
Dewey of all people.
Come on, seriously.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.995
Can you imagine the
freakin' speeches?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.963
There won't be any.
(laughter)

12:09.963 --> 12:11.231
You coming, Kenny?

12:11.231 --> 12:13.767
Coming where?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.735
(laughter)

12:15.735 --> 12:17.470
Retirement party, man.
You got to go.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.738
You didn't get the e-mail,
seriously?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.639
No.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.774
(laughter)

12:20.774 --> 12:22.209
Hey, Janila.
Hey, Janila!

12:22.209 --> 12:24.044
Hey, sweetheart,
uh, come with me.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.246
I'll show you my friend
who runs the Explorers.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.816
They said I had
to get a sponsor.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.917
Will you sponsor me?

12:29.917 --> 12:30.784
Of course.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.152
Are you kidding?

12:32.152 --> 12:35.055
Um, they said that I had
to have a parent sign it.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.158
But my dad's in jail,
and my mom's on drugs.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.893
I live with my grandmother.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.328
You mean she's
your guardian, yeah?

12:41.328 --> 12:42.329
Yeah.
Perfect.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.031
Yeah, no problem.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.298
Come on.
Have fun.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.038
You better be kidding me.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.273
No, no, I don't think
it's a good idea.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.775
Come on, Sal.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.745
You don't think about me?

12:58.745 --> 12:59.980
Hmm?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.148
Don't you miss me?

13:01.148 --> 13:03.050
Of course I still
think about you.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.619
A lot, all right?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.555
Way more than I should.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.724
Mia, that's my kid calling.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.493
I got to take this, all right?

13:13.493 --> 13:14.661
All right.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.063
Okay.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.034
Hey, Peanut, what's up?

13:21.034 --> 13:24.872
No, no, you cannot go
to Hollywood Boulevard.

13:24.872 --> 13:28.475
Because I said so.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.913
Because it's filled with creeps
trying to get over, that's why.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.382
I'm not gonna argue about this--

13:35.382 --> 13:36.616
Hello?

13:36.616 --> 13:37.750
(knocking)

13:37.750 --> 13:39.619
Police!

13:39.619 --> 13:40.753
Yeah?
How you doing?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.522
Have you seen this kid?
What?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.623
No?
No.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.092
Okay.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.561
You, uh, if you hear anything,
give us a holler.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.567
It's police!

13:59.772 --> 14:01.074
What?

14:01.074 --> 14:04.077
I saw the baby
climb out of a box.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.545
The baby?
Yeah.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.647
It tipped over the box
and just climbed out.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.217
(laughs):
I mean...

14:10.217 --> 14:11.684
I thought I was
hallucinating.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.053
(both laugh)

14:13.053 --> 14:16.089
And then you just let it
crawl into traffic, right?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.757
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

14:17.757 --> 14:18.959
I-I had split
by then.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.560
I had to get
some breakfast.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.529
You know, they serve this French
toast over at the church...

14:22.529 --> 14:24.764
Barry, I need you to show me
where the box was.
Yeah.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.732
Okay?
Yeah.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.900
All right, let's go.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.109
(indistinct radio chatter)

14:39.947 --> 14:41.648
Oh, I also got
a partial plate.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.552
I'm gonna fucking
kill you.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.722
So you saw a car
drop off the box?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.758
No, I saw it drive away.

14:51.758 --> 14:56.029
The part that I saw read...
"3D24."

14:56.029 --> 14:57.965
Of course, I need glasses.

14:57.965 --> 14:58.865
(chuckles)
Want me to run it?

14:58.865 --> 15:00.300
I got it.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.503
CHICKIE:
Well, do you know
what kind of car it was?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.438
Yep.

15:09.176 --> 15:12.112
Oh, uh, it was a, um...

15:13.981 --> 15:15.748
El Camino.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.350
Red, '87, '88.

15:18.685 --> 15:23.490
The El Camino's registered
to a Christi Cummings.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.758
C-H-R-I-S-T-Y?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.594
S-T-I.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.199
Okay, she's a 647b.

15:32.199 --> 15:36.169
Been arrested about ten
times-- prostitution, drugs.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.638
I'm gonna call Vice and
see if she's active.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.477
Any updates
on Baby Doe?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.946
Yeah, someone saw
a car drop him off.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.248
It's registered to a woman.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.816
We're gonna see
if we can find her.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.251
Well, I need
to open a case

15:51.251 --> 15:52.385
on the baby in
the next 72 hours.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.853
I'm gonna
put him in

15:53.853 --> 15:56.656
foster care tonight unless
you tell me otherwise.

15:56.656 --> 15:57.924
Okay.

15:57.924 --> 16:02.229
Um, you got a card with
a direct number I can call you?

16:06.766 --> 16:07.767
The baby?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.702
Oh, yeah, sorry.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.713
(crying)

16:27.920 --> 16:29.956
Gonna be all right.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.158
All right.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.162
Okay.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.610
I can't believe this scumbag.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.080
It's so over.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.215
He told me that he
had to take the baby

16:55.215 --> 16:56.449
to the doctor,
on account of

16:56.449 --> 16:58.851
his ex, Brianna,
couldn't do it today.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.520
She's the mom.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.654
(chuckles)

17:01.654 --> 17:03.956
I wouldn't have lent him
the car otherwise.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.393
He's such an asshole!

17:06.393 --> 17:07.494
We're gonna need
scumbag's name.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.529
Skylar Joel.
I'll run it.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.505
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:18.505 --> 17:21.608
OFFICER:
Left, right, left, right, left,

17:21.608 --> 17:23.643
left.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.745
Left, right.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.979
Ready.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.616
Halt.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.318
Left face.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.488
About face.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.190
Perez!

17:37.190 --> 17:40.460
How big are you?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.828
What did you
just say to me?!

17:41.828 --> 17:44.063
Big enough to knock you
on your ass, sir!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.032
That's what I want to hear!

17:46.032 --> 17:47.534
Now, what are we gonna do?

17:47.534 --> 17:49.402
KIDS:
Take back the
neighborhoods, sir!

17:49.402 --> 17:50.570
I can't hear you!

17:50.570 --> 17:53.206
Take back
the neighborhoods, sir!

17:53.206 --> 17:55.475
MORETTA:
That's what I'm
talking about!

17:55.475 --> 17:57.144
Kimmy, you've got to calm down.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.578
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.513
(siren, emergency horn
in distance)

18:00.513 --> 18:02.349
Dad, they towed Mom's car!

18:02.349 --> 18:04.617
Kimmy, I told you
not to take that car.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.485
Where are you?

18:05.485 --> 18:07.053
I'm on Hollywood Boulevard!

18:07.053 --> 18:08.054
You stay there.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.322
I'm coming to get you.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.557
Don't go anywhere.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.224
Fine.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.725
Just stay there.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.767
(rap music playing)

18:20.767 --> 18:24.471
This guy's got a, uh,
ten-page rap sheet.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.773
Spousal abuse, drug
possession, 211.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.608
Great.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.643
Hey.
(door buzzer sounds)

18:36.449 --> 18:38.485
(TV playing muffled)

18:51.130 --> 18:52.098
SKYLAR:
Who's there?

18:52.098 --> 18:53.266
Open the door, Skylar.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.640
(lock clicking)

19:00.640 --> 19:02.342
Hands! Hands!

19:02.342 --> 19:04.411
Get your hands in the air!
Bathroom! Bathroom!

19:04.411 --> 19:05.478
You're under arrest.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.247
Clear!
No way, man!

19:16.223 --> 19:17.357
Stop!

19:17.357 --> 19:18.858
RUSSELL:
Gun! Gun! Gun!

19:18.858 --> 19:20.527
Stop!

19:20.527 --> 19:22.662
Suspect dropped
their gun.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.630
I got it.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.770
All right, hold it
right there, Skylar.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.938
Hold it.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.540
Stop!

19:33.540 --> 19:37.477
Requesting assistance
at Westlake and 7th.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.447
Westside alley, eyes on suspect.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.682
(indistinct radio chatter)

19:42.682 --> 19:43.650
(siren whoops)

19:47.720 --> 19:49.756
RUSSELL:
Hold it right there.
Come on, Skylar.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.190
Turn around, put your
hands above your head!

19:51.190 --> 19:52.259
I'm not going back
to prison, man.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.426
No way!
Drop your weapon!

19:53.426 --> 19:54.794
No way, man!
You're going back.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.128
Drop! Stay where you are!
Hold it right there.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.330
Drop the
knife, Skylar.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.265
SKYLAR:
No way, I'm not going back!

19:58.265 --> 19:59.399
Russell!

19:59.399 --> 20:00.633
You want to
shoot him?
Yeah!

20:00.633 --> 20:02.435
Hand me the
less lethal.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.603
CHICKIE:
Stay right where you are!

20:03.603 --> 20:04.971
Drop the weapon.
Drop it right now.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.306
SKYLAR:
Go away, man!
I told you,

20:06.306 --> 20:07.340
I'm not dropping
the knife!

20:07.340 --> 20:09.276
Right now, Skylar!
No way, man!

20:09.276 --> 20:10.943
No way!

20:10.943 --> 20:13.680
(pounding on door)

20:14.847 --> 20:15.848
(grunts)

20:15.848 --> 20:17.550
Ow! God, man, no!

20:17.550 --> 20:18.951
Let's go!
It hurt, man!

20:18.951 --> 20:20.119
Get up
and spread your legs.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.288
SKYLAR:
Oh, sh...

20:21.288 --> 20:22.489
COOPER:
You got anything else on you?

20:22.489 --> 20:23.556
SKYLAR:
No! (screams)

20:23.556 --> 20:24.691
CHICKIE:
Six-Adam-four-seven.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.926
Show us how we forward
our location.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.061
Suspect is in custody.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.363
What the hell was that?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.731
Bean bag.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.633
Please, don't shoot me
with that again.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.902
COOPER:
Don't go pulling knives
on cops, asshole.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.439
I been shot, I been stabbed,
and that hurt, man.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.041
(speaking Spanish)

20:42.041 --> 20:45.345
You gonna take care
of my little girl?

20:45.345 --> 20:46.879
Consider it already be done.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.215
I'll take care of
what need to be done out here.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.850
Gracias.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.918
I appreciate it.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.253
All right, my boy.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.489
She need to
go to church.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.325
She needs structure.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.659
Well, Ms. Johnson,
this is, uh,

20:59.659 --> 21:01.894
this is kind of like church.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.667
You smile like that,
the girls just fall over, huh?

21:09.569 --> 21:12.305
I-I don't like her
hanging around

21:12.305 --> 21:14.240
with you people
all the time.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.343
Bad enough she testifying.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.181
I bought this house,
this was a good neighborhood.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.651
Now look at it.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.787
Oh, you have no idea
how bad it gets.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.489
Which is why she
should do this.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.491
I promise, it's
a good thing.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.092
I broke up with Marquece.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.361
That little fool.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.396
You should've done that
a long time ago.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.769
That was fun.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.047
MAN:
Newton turban!

21:55.047 --> 21:57.283
I don't understand
why you're arresting me

21:57.283 --> 21:58.985
for trying to do
the right thing.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.187
I mean, you're allowed
to give up a baby.

22:01.187 --> 22:04.491
You know how many people
tried to buy it off of me?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.926
I could've sold it,
which I did not do.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.729
You can give up a baby
within three days of birth

22:09.729 --> 22:11.564
to a hospital
or a fire station.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.533
The building looked
official, okay?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.535
It had converters and stuff.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.604
It was a power
substation, you idiot.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.138
Where's the mother?

22:19.138 --> 22:21.107
That bitch broke
up with me.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.475
Does she know what you did?

22:22.475 --> 22:26.112
I need to talk
to the mother, Skylar.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.915
She tells me she wants
to go straight.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.883
Then she gets some
dumb-ass job,

22:30.883 --> 22:33.185
and every time
she has a problem,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.287
she dumps the baby on me.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.156
And I don't even know
if it's mine.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.927
I mean, she was screwing about
ten guys at the same time.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.532
Her name.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.100
I need her name.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.336
Do you know why they
towed the car, Kimmy?

22:50.336 --> 22:51.871
'Cause it was
in a tow-away zone.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.939
I'm sorry!

22:52.939 --> 22:54.907
You guys have got
a way home, right?

22:54.907 --> 22:56.509
I'm gonna call
your parents tonight,

22:56.509 --> 22:58.711
so the numbers you gave me
better be right.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.282
You just humiliated me!

23:03.282 --> 23:05.885
Too bad.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.354
(phone rings)
Is that Mommy?

23:08.354 --> 23:09.789
No.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.067
Who is Brianna?

23:21.067 --> 23:25.404
Could you tell her
I need to talk to
her about her son?

23:33.012 --> 23:35.548
Is this about Jimmy?

23:38.718 --> 23:41.588
Your ex, Skylar, decided
to give him away.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.155
He thought it was
for the best.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.692
We found him crawling down
the street on his own.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.427
Oh, my God, is he okay?
He's safe.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.562
Where is he?

23:49.562 --> 23:51.130
Children's Services
has him.

23:51.130 --> 23:55.167
No. Once they get them,
you can't get them back!

23:55.167 --> 23:56.769
I want to see my son now!

23:56.769 --> 23:58.771
Can I see him?
No, not right now.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.575
DCFS has him,
and he's safe.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.176
How did this
happen, Brianna?

24:04.176 --> 24:07.013
I leave him with this woman
while I work--

24:07.013 --> 24:09.882
she's really good--
but she had an emergency

24:09.882 --> 24:11.951
with her own son at school,

24:11.951 --> 24:14.987
and so I told her
to leave him with Skylar.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.724
I usually don't,
but this was an emergency.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.125
According to Skylar,

24:19.125 --> 24:21.594
you leave the baby
with him all the time.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.095
No. That's a lie.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.364
He hates me
because I went straight.

24:25.364 --> 24:29.435
I... The minute I found out
that I was pregnant with Jimmy,

24:29.435 --> 24:31.103
I stopped using.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.739
I got a job right away.

24:32.739 --> 24:35.207
I've never done
anything to hurt him.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.809
I've been trying so hard.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.545
How'd he get the
scar on his leg?

24:38.545 --> 24:40.212
He's like Houdini!

24:40.212 --> 24:41.614
He gets out of everything.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.551
He-he got out of his high chair
and scraped his leg

24:44.551 --> 24:47.286
on the screw that
was holding it together.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.555
I got it secondhand.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.157
I took him to get
a tetanus shot right away.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.393
He has all his shots.
So, we take him
to the E.R.,

24:54.393 --> 24:58.565
get some X rays--
we gonna find anything else?

24:58.565 --> 25:01.568
Some old broken bones,
more scars?

25:01.568 --> 25:05.237
No! I love my son!

25:05.237 --> 25:07.473
He's all that I have.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.677
Please, please can I see him?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.382
MAN:
Now, Dewey graduated
from the academy in 1986.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.551
He wasn't the top of his class,

25:18.551 --> 25:20.252
but he wasn't the bottom--
but close.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.754
(laughter)
Yeah.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.390
No-No Child Left Behind,
you know what I'm saying?

25:24.390 --> 25:27.459
(laughter)
His first assignment
was South Central,

25:27.459 --> 25:29.028
where he did his probation.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.564
Now, he worked there
from '86 to '88,

25:31.564 --> 25:33.600
when he was asked to leave.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.134
(laughter)
Huh? I mean, that's something.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.269
He had 20 mouth-beefs
at the time.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.638
That was a record back then.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.472
21!
Very nice, very nice.

25:40.472 --> 25:43.876
Now, in '98, he went over
to Venice, beach patrol.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.512
Some say he learned
how to drink there.

25:46.512 --> 25:49.281
I think he was working
on his tan the whole time.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.718
(laughter)
Riding around on a bicycle

25:51.718 --> 25:54.654
in a T-shirt and shorts...
(continues indistinctly)

25:54.654 --> 25:57.056
That your
BSS shrink?
Uh-huh.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.694
How much longer
do you have to do that?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.963
Uh, not much longer,
I think.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.734
He uncovering all your deep,
dark Beverly Hills secrets?

26:10.937 --> 26:12.171
Like what?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.942
You know who
my father is, right?

26:15.942 --> 26:18.510
Scumbag defense lawyer,
Ben Sherman?

26:18.510 --> 26:19.946
Yeah.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.681
Yeah.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.684
My father represented
this drug dealer.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.418
Guy's brother went to jail.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.288
Dealer was pissed, thought
it was my dad's fault.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.058
Had some people over
to, uh, visit our house.

26:32.058 --> 26:36.328
Only problem was,
that my dad had already
walked out and left us.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.433
They were pretty pissed off.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.002
I was ten.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.105
After that,

26:46.105 --> 26:49.241
this kid I was in school with,
his, uh, his dad thought

26:49.241 --> 26:51.878
I should learn
to defend myself, so...

26:51.878 --> 26:55.347
he took me and his son
to the gun club every Saturday.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.684
Taught us both to shoot.

26:57.684 --> 26:59.719
(people cheering,
whistling in distance)

26:59.719 --> 27:01.654
You want another?

27:01.654 --> 27:03.489
No.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.757
I'm good.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.759
MAN:
Just one tiny correction
to make.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.361
Uh, in '98,
when I went to Venice,

27:09.361 --> 27:10.730
I already knew how to drink,

27:10.730 --> 27:12.064
I just perfected it!

27:12.064 --> 27:14.166
(people shouting, clapping)
Yeah!

27:14.166 --> 27:15.735
Venice rocked, man,
Venice rocked.

27:15.735 --> 27:19.238
Everybody went around
sporting bikinis...

27:19.238 --> 27:21.240
(whispers):
Hey.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.441
Mia, hi.

27:22.441 --> 27:23.542
Hi, Sal.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.844
How you doing?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.045
I'm doing great.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.580
Great. This is
my daughter Kimmy.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.549
Oh, hi, Kimmy.
Nice to meet you.

27:30.549 --> 27:33.753
Can I talk to you
for a second?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.421
Yeah.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.655
Yeah, sure.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.525
(laughter)
Whoa!
Hey. Hey!

27:39.525 --> 27:42.762
Let me tell you something,
if those guys saw me coming,

27:42.762 --> 27:45.164
they ran the other way! Aah!

27:45.164 --> 27:48.300
Why did you let him
take the baby?

27:48.300 --> 27:50.136
I already told you,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.271
the woman I leave him with
had an emergency.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.707
I'm trying
to work with you here,

27:54.707 --> 27:57.043
but I have some
very serious concerns.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.811
Can I see him, please?

27:58.811 --> 28:00.146
Not right now.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.949
Can I speak with you
for a moment, privately?

28:02.949 --> 28:06.418
Brianna,
give us a second?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.128
What's the problem?
I'm gonna
open a case,

28:16.128 --> 28:18.097
and she's very likely
gonna lose this baby.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.766
I've worked
with you people before,

28:19.766 --> 28:21.533
and this is not
how you do things.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.003
You're not baby stealers;
you keep the families together.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.438
She has a history
of prostitution,
she's a drug addict,

28:26.438 --> 28:28.340
and she gave the baby to
a meth-addicted father.

28:28.340 --> 28:31.177
I think she...
She's endangering
the child.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.380
What if she's clean?
What if I give her
back the baby

28:34.380 --> 28:36.515
and it winds up
dead in a week?

28:36.515 --> 28:38.017
You do your job,

28:38.017 --> 28:40.019
let me do mine.
But you're not
doing your job,

28:40.019 --> 28:41.453
you're judging her.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.791
The baby deserves a chance
to grow up with his mother.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.359
Yes, she screwed up,
but she's asking

28:47.359 --> 28:49.829
for another chance.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.730
Give it to her.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.438
Yes, can you send in
Ms. Smith, please?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.286
Honey, this is my buddy Tom
I was telling you about.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.755
He's gonna take Richter.
Hi. How are you?

29:19.325 --> 29:21.260
Let's get this
over with, all right?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.561
Okay, sure.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.798
We're gonna go put him
in Tom's truck now, okay?

29:25.798 --> 29:27.766
Fine.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.609
So, Sammy said
you have goats.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.978
300 goats.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.312
It's a business,
honey.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.581
Rent-a-Rumanant--
they clear brush.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.316
Fire prevention.
No kidding?

29:44.316 --> 29:46.252
They clear brush
faster than a crew.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.754
They never call in sick,
no chemicals,

29:48.754 --> 29:51.057
no waste--
they're green as hell.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.893
Never thought I'd be one
of those ecological do-gooders.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.895
Open up.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.400
Hey there, big fella.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.302
You want to help me
herd some goats?

30:03.302 --> 30:05.404
(barking)
Huh? You're
confused, ain't ya?

30:05.404 --> 30:07.339
Bring him out.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.441
Come on, Tammi,
let's do this.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.676
All right, all right.

30:10.676 --> 30:13.245
Come on!
Give me a second!

30:13.245 --> 30:14.780
Come on.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.949
I know. Me, too.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.784
I miss you.

30:18.784 --> 30:19.952
I miss you.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.921
I miss you a lot.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.656
Not here, not here.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.526
Come on, Sal, one kiss.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.835
Sal.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.177
(groans)

30:45.177 --> 30:46.678
Most of all, I...

30:46.678 --> 30:48.915
(man whistles)

30:48.915 --> 30:51.283
wish you luck,
Dewey, with...

30:51.283 --> 30:54.053
whatever you do
in retirement.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.688
(scattered chuckles)
Wow!

30:56.688 --> 30:58.257
(man shouts indistinctly)

30:58.257 --> 31:00.459
(chatter, whooping)
My God, hey....

31:00.459 --> 31:03.629
Hey, wait, did... did you
write that speech yourself?

31:03.629 --> 31:04.964
(laughter)
My God!

31:04.964 --> 31:06.565
DEWEY:
What the hell
do you mean

31:06.565 --> 31:08.867
you don't know what I'm
gonna do in retirement?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.836
In case you
haven't noticed

31:10.836 --> 31:12.304
this beautiful
new uniform of mine,

31:12.304 --> 31:14.673
I'm gonna go to work
on movie sets.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.475
(rowdy shouts, whooping)

31:16.475 --> 31:19.611
Hey, hey, they're gonna take
one look at my ass

31:19.611 --> 31:22.281
on my motorcycle,
and they're gonna make me

31:22.281 --> 31:23.815
(whooping)
a star, baby! Yeah!

31:23.815 --> 31:26.685
Hey, and I got my boys
in the back to thank for that.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.021
You guys just tell me
how much I owe...

31:29.021 --> 31:31.023
Dad, she's so cool.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.158
What?!

31:32.158 --> 31:33.359
She's so beautiful.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.161
I've seen her
on the news.

31:35.161 --> 31:37.763
You're being disrespectful
towards your mother.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.598
Mom's a bitch.
Shh!

31:39.598 --> 31:43.669
You will never talk that way
about your mother, you hear me?

31:43.669 --> 31:45.237
Kimmy?

31:45.237 --> 31:46.973
Kimmy!

31:51.777 --> 31:53.812
You think he'll
go back to prison?

31:53.812 --> 31:55.814
Yeah. Three strikes law.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.549
And he's got about eight.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.152
Child endangerment,
child abandonment.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.821
He violated his parole
with the drugs.

32:02.821 --> 32:04.991
Attempted murder
on an officer.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.692
Good.

32:09.261 --> 32:13.399
They're not gonna let me
have my baby back, are they?

32:17.803 --> 32:20.039
Probably not.

32:23.675 --> 32:27.513
I'm begging you
to help me get Jimmy back.

32:27.513 --> 32:28.814
I'm begging you.

32:28.814 --> 32:31.283
Please.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.685
I need another chance.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.155
He's all I've got.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.103
(whimpers)

32:51.103 --> 32:52.638
(screaming):
Stop!

33:01.780 --> 33:04.883
DEWEY:
For those of you that don't
know-- my beautiful wife.

33:04.883 --> 33:07.386
(cheers and whistles)

33:07.386 --> 33:09.255
I can't thank you enough
for coming back to me.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.689
I'm sure it had absolutely

33:10.689 --> 33:13.859
nothing to do with
my tax-free medical pension.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.461
(laughter)

33:15.461 --> 33:16.728
Where the hell's my shrink?

33:16.728 --> 33:18.030
My shrink is here somewhere.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.398
And my sponsor.

33:19.398 --> 33:20.866
In the back-- beautiful ladies.

33:20.866 --> 33:21.833
I want to bang you both!

33:21.833 --> 33:23.135
(laughter)

33:23.135 --> 33:25.371
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, sweetheart.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.039
Uh, you know, in
all seriousness,

33:27.039 --> 33:29.675
you know, I-I know
I messed up.

33:29.675 --> 33:33.512
They say I've got a disease
called addiction.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.148
Personally, I just think
I'm an asshole.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.884
But, uh, you know,
I just want to say,

33:38.884 --> 33:43.989
that there hasn't been a day
that's gone by-- drunk, sober--

33:43.989 --> 33:46.792
that I haven't loved this job.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.995
I love this job.
I love you guys.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.164
(phone rings,
applause, cheers)

33:52.164 --> 33:53.532
(ringing continues)

33:53.532 --> 33:57.669
Let's have a couple
drinks, all right?

33:57.669 --> 33:58.804
What is it, Janila?

33:58.804 --> 33:59.905
They shot up our house.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.107
What?!

34:01.107 --> 34:03.909
(tearfully):
They shot up our house.

34:03.909 --> 34:04.910
Are you all right?

34:04.910 --> 34:07.313
We're okay.

34:07.313 --> 34:08.647
We'll be right there.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.283
Okay?
I'm sending a squad car over.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.518
(rock music playing)

34:14.019 --> 34:16.622
(growling, fabric ripping)

34:19.258 --> 34:22.328
Were there ever drugs
in the glove compartment?

34:22.328 --> 34:24.263
Come here.
It's okay.

34:24.263 --> 34:28.100
Fucking kid.
He borrowed it last week.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.902
(sighs)

34:30.902 --> 34:32.704
I can't take this dog.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.106
He could go nuts.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.607
Hurt a goat.

34:35.607 --> 34:39.878
It's okay.
I-I totally understand.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.248
Don't worry about it.

34:42.248 --> 34:45.551
(helicopter circling overhead)

34:47.353 --> 34:48.554
She break up with the fool,

34:48.554 --> 34:50.456
you think he gonna
take that lying down?

34:50.456 --> 34:52.258
Ms. Johnson, I
realize you're upset.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.792
But I need you to calm down.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.527
SAMMY:
Are you gonna help
me out here or not?

34:55.527 --> 34:57.563
D.A.: I told you,
we don't have the funds.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.331
The girl's an associate
of Grape St.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.432
Who cares who it was!

35:00.432 --> 35:02.234
They're in real danger here.

35:02.234 --> 35:03.969
I'm sorry,
we don't have the money.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.504
You're sorry.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.474
You wonder why we can't get
anybody to testify?

35:09.808 --> 35:12.678
That was kinda sad.

35:12.678 --> 35:17.015
Yeah.

35:17.015 --> 35:21.587
Oh, my speech sucked.

35:21.587 --> 35:26.192
It was, uh, kind of
anemic, I have to say.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.727
(chuckling)

35:35.201 --> 35:36.668
Uh, this is me.

35:42.574 --> 35:46.278
So, there's a lot more
to that story, isn't there?

35:46.278 --> 35:48.714
People were in your house?

35:48.714 --> 35:50.249
Yeah.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.484
Where were you?

35:57.323 --> 35:59.758
I gotta go.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.560
Oka-Okay.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.462
See you.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.597
See you.
Yeah.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.272
You aren't connected
with your family?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.073
I was abused
by my father.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.842
My mother looked
the other way.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.678
Have you been in therapy
to deal with all this?

36:19.678 --> 36:22.881
Yes. I saw someone
from "Children of the Night"

36:22.881 --> 36:24.516
when I first got clean.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.185
Are you affiliated
with a church?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.621
I mostly go to MCC in Hollywood.

36:29.621 --> 36:33.359
They're kind of gay,
but they're really nice

36:33.359 --> 36:34.860
and I can bring Jimmy.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.896
Do you have a sponsor?

36:37.896 --> 36:42.268
There's this woman I talk to.
She's really nice.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.142
It hurts!

36:51.142 --> 36:53.879
What hurts?

36:56.482 --> 36:58.517
Kimmy, what hurts?!

37:00.852 --> 37:04.356
I got my bellybutton pierced
on Hollywood Blvd.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.492
You did what?

37:06.492 --> 37:08.594
Do you know
how dangerous that is?

37:08.594 --> 37:11.563
Do you know you can catch HIV
from that?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.632
Hep C!

37:13.632 --> 37:15.467
I want the name
of the person who did it

37:15.467 --> 37:16.568
'cause I'm shutting them down!

37:16.568 --> 37:18.504
Dad, will you
stop yelling at me?!

37:18.504 --> 37:19.838
All you do is yell at me.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.607
I'm not yelling at you!
Yes, you are!

37:24.543 --> 37:27.546
All right, look, I can
start a file for her

37:27.546 --> 37:29.648
in the voluntary
reunification program.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.451
Get her the support
she needs.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.785
You can't parent
in a vacuum.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.153
Thank you.

37:35.153 --> 37:38.390
Get her into a parenting group,
appropriate day care.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.759
I need to take
a picture of Jimmy,

37:40.759 --> 37:42.828
and then I need to see
where she's living.

37:42.828 --> 37:43.829
Now? Tonight?

37:43.829 --> 37:45.764
That's right.

37:45.764 --> 37:46.832
Okay.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.571
(crying)

37:52.571 --> 37:54.906
Can you remove
the clothes?

37:54.906 --> 37:57.609
I need to take a
picture of his body.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.497
Seventy bucks.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.302
Change.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.805
I really appreciate
what y'all are doing

38:26.805 --> 38:28.540
for me and my
granddaughter.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.408
It's no problem.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.076
They have a pool.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.714
I'm a really good swimmer.

38:39.485 --> 38:43.389
My ass is on the line
here and so is yours.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.690
I know.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.006
Thank you.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.741
Take care.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.620
(rings doorbell)

39:58.997 --> 40:00.866
Is he home?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.314
You called me.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.584
That was four months ago.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.922
You look good.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.995
What are you doing?

40:29.995 --> 40:31.630
I don't know.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.832
This mother lost
her baby and...

40:33.832 --> 40:37.402
we found the baby crawling
down the street by himself.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.837
One year old.

40:38.837 --> 40:42.140
Yeah, I heard about it
on the news.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.110
The baby's back
with his mom.

40:45.110 --> 40:48.847
I think they're
gonna be fine.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.048
You okay?

40:53.785 --> 40:56.555
I think I made a mistake.

40:56.555 --> 40:59.891
You know? With you.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.229
I really do want a kid.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.570
I gotta... I gotta go inside.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.772
Yeah, I know. I know.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.579
You take care.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.522
(door closes)

41:31.790 --> 41:33.792
* All I can ever be to you

41:33.792 --> 41:35.994
* Is a darkness that we knew

41:35.994 --> 41:39.531
* And this regret I've got
accustomed to *

41:39.531 --> 41:40.732
* It's my responsibility

41:40.732 --> 41:43.368
* You don't owe nothing to me

41:43.368 --> 41:47.505
* But, to walk away,
I have no capacity *

41:47.505 --> 41:52.010
* He walks away,
the sun goes down *

41:52.010 --> 41:54.345
* He takes the day,
but I'm grown *

41:54.345 --> 41:58.316
* And in your way,
in this blue shade *

41:58.316 --> 42:02.153
* My tears dry on their own.
