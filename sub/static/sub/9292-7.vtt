00:14.200 --> 00:17.237
- Has Bauer arrived at CTU?
- No, not yet.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.675
<i>I need you to clear an entrance.</i>

00:19.760 --> 00:21.876
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

00:21.960 --> 00:25.430
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer,
they have a reason.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.509
This man is a
professional assassin.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.196
He killed Dr Paulson.
Did you let him into CTU?!

00:30.280 --> 00:34.353
They told me he was here to place a tap
on one of the servers. That's all I knew.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.795
- Who told you?
- The White House.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.711
Mr Cummings.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.755
Palmer was murdered because
he was about to expose Cummings' link.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.593
You want the gas,
Cummings is your connection.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.831
Cummings is the president's chief advisor.
How do we get to him?

00:48.920 --> 00:50.558
I secretly meet Mike Novick.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.669
- Who did you tell? Who did you tell?
- I didn't tell anybody, Jack.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.754
- Tell your men to stand down!
- Sorry, sir, we can't do that.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.834
The gas is being smuggled out by separatists

01:02.920 --> 01:05.559
who think they're going to use it
against Russians.

01:05.640 --> 01:09.349
- However, it will never reach Russian soil.
- And you know this how?

01:09.440 --> 01:12.159
We control the remote detonators
on those canisters.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.153
As soon as they reach the terrorist base,
we'll trigger the canisters.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.913
- You're a traitor.
- Let things play out as they are.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.154
Otherwise, your administration will be
implicated, and your presidency destroyed.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.388
Mr President, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm sorry to confront you like this.

01:28.480 --> 01:34.032
But your chief of staff is withholding
information vital to this nation's security.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.352
Stop this!

01:36.440 --> 01:39.319
I'm done talking
with you, understand?

01:39.404 --> 01:42.788
So, for the last time,
where is the nerve gas?

01:42.880 --> 01:45.599
Stop. Stop! Stop! I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.513
It's on a freighter
leaving the port of Long Beach at 2:30.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.515
CTU, we have located the target container.
No hostiles present.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.955
<i>You have a green light.</i>

01:55.040 --> 01:56.917
<i>Open 'em up. Open 'em all up.</i>

01:57.000 --> 02:00.390
Moving on, moving on.
What have we got? Nothing?

02:00.480 --> 02:04.314
<i>There are no gas canisters here, CTU.
The nerve gas is not here.</i>

02:04.400 --> 02:07.153
- Where are the canisters?
- I've told you everything.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.949
We know you've altered the arming codes.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.554
Erwich, listen. We can negotiate something.

02:13.640 --> 02:17.155
I don't negotiate with my enemies.
I eliminate them.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.030
Your country is about to pay
a very steep price for betraying us.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.957
I was approached six months ago by a man
named James Nathanson. He was my contact.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.190
- Who is he?
- Former ClA.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.989
Said he was recruiting like-minded
individuals for this initiative.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.277
Initiative? Is that what you call this?

02:43.360 --> 02:46.557
You helped terrorists
acquire weaponised nerve gas!

02:46.640 --> 02:51.031
We were going to trigger the canisters
once they reached their base in central Asia.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.680
- This was not supposed to happen.
- It happened!

02:53.760 --> 02:57.833
You got into bed with them and they're
threatening to use the gas on US citizens.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.309
You say it like our goal
was to kill Americans.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.995
What the hell was your goal, Walt?
Explain that to me.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.512
We're patriots, Mr President. We were
acting in the best interests of this country.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.869
How is any of this in our best interest?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.520
Shoring up a strategic partner
in the war on terror.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.673
Ensuring a stable flow of oil. How is
any of that not in the national interest?

03:21.760 --> 03:24.593
I have Chloe O'Brian
on the line for Jack Bauer,

03:24.680 --> 03:28.195
- Chloe, are you set up for the trace?
- All set, Jack.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.272
- We're ready to call Nathanson.
- How long do I keep him on?

03:31.360 --> 03:35.353
Until I give you a signal.
Chloe, dial the number.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.277
The line's disconnected.
There's nothing to grab onto.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.989
- He must know something went wrong.
- Dammit, Walt!

03:46.080 --> 03:49.436
I don't want this weapon deployed
on US soil any more than you do,

03:49.520 --> 03:52.876
but Nathanson cannot help you now
and neither can l.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.918
These terrorists are operating on their own.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.591
Mr President, I think he's telling the truth.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.558
He can't help us, not any more.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.230
Aaron.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.914
- Get him out of here.
- Yes, sir.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.432
Jack.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.923
What do we do now?

04:27.008 --> 04:29.992
I need to be debriefed.
After that I'm leaving.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.038
Given the situation,
things are more complicated.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.795
CTU is gonna have to be responsible
for retrieval of the canisters.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.518
Why are you leaving?

04:38.600 --> 04:42.388
Sir, I have a daughter
that doesn't know that I'm still alive.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.552
If I have to disappear again,
in all fairness to her,

04:45.640 --> 04:48.473
I don't think she should know.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.759
Jack, terrorists just threatened
to deploy chemical weapons on US soil.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.071
- They have the ability to kill millions.
- I understand that.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.037
I believe that CTU can handle this.

04:59.120 --> 05:03.989
Jack, your experience could make
a crucial difference in stopping them.

05:04.080 --> 05:09.234
Look, you and I have a complicated history,
I realise that.

05:09.320 --> 05:15.031
And I'm not naive enough to expect
any special personal allegiance from you.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.554
But I know your respect for this office

05:17.640 --> 05:21.918
is just as strong as it was
when you served under David Palmer.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.151
I'm asking for your help,
just until this crisis is over.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.676
I will reinstate you.
I will give you all the support you need.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.673
- Mr President, you and l...
- Jack, please! For God's sake!

05:32.760 --> 05:37.231
We need to recover this nerve gas
before it's too late.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.754
The microcircuitry on this
has been tampered with.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.674
As far as I can tell, unless we can
repair it, we can't arm the canisters.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.469
Rossler will have a way.
He should have called by now.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.872
Our real enemy is Russia. We should
be figuring out another way to get back home,

05:57.960 --> 06:02.909
not wasting time
trying to use the gas against the Americans.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.831
Question my orders again and I will kill you.
You understand?

06:08.920 --> 06:13.391
They've closed the ports.
They will hunt us until they find us.

06:13.480 --> 06:18.998
So if we cannot use the gas against Russia,
we will use it against America.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.631
Get up.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.954
<i>- Hello.
- Lynn.</i>

06:35.040 --> 06:40.353
- Jenny, now is a really bad time.
- I know you're busy, but I need to see you.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.352
- What is it?
- I need some help.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.352
- You mean money.
- Lynn, I'm clean.

06:46.880 --> 06:52.113
I'm working two jobs and busting my ass
to put my life back together.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.476
<i>- How much?
- 500.</i>

06:55.560 --> 06:57.755
Can l... can I come over there?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.478
Absolutely not.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.996
Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?

07:03.080 --> 07:05.116
Yeah, I am.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.351
Lynn, I got nobody else to turn to. I just...

07:08.440 --> 07:11.910
You know, I can't go
back on the street again.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.754
If you don't help me, I swear l...
I'm gonna hurt myself.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.990
For God's sake, Lynn, I'm your sister,

07:18.080 --> 07:20.116
Listen.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.792
Jenny, listen.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.078
There's a parking lot across from CTU.
I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.479
OK.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.437
Thank you, Lynn.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.990
- The numbers we...
- Sorry I'm late.

07:40.080 --> 07:45.871
I was explaining that Cummings provided us
with a schematic of one of the canisters.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.795
Triggering mechanisms on the canisters
can only be activated via satellite relay.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.997
Cummings says the terrorists
have invalid detonation codes.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.419
The canisters are useless.

07:55.504 --> 07:57.993
Unless they find a way
to control the trigger.

07:58.080 --> 08:03.791
- Are we running evacuation scenarios?
- Not without a time frame or a target.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.269
Erwich's threat was intentionally vague.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.033
<i>- What are we doing to track them?
- Chloe.</i>

08:09.120 --> 08:13.477
I pulled a voiceprint from Erwich's call
and I'm doing a scan of all Satcom chatter.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.872
If he is in contact with anyone, we should
be able to intercept and trace the call.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.714
We'd better get lucky cos we just got
an assessment from Civil Defense.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.234
They estimate
the nerve gas from each canister

08:24.320 --> 08:27.312
will create kill zones
between one and three square miles.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.039
The terrorists
are in possession of 20 canisters.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.955
We're talking about potential casualties in
the hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.839
<i>- Yeah.
- Ivan Erwich?</i>

08:41.919 --> 08:44.593
- Go ahead.
- Jacob Rossler.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.035
I was asked to call you
by a friend in Moscow.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.156
You've been briefed on our situation?

08:49.240 --> 08:55.076
You need to reconfigure the remote trigger
for an A-tox chemical delivery system, right?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.913
- Yes.
- You have the canisters with you?

08:58.000 --> 08:58.989
<i>Yes.</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:03.835
<i>You'll need to start by cutting into them.
I'll give you the specifications.</i>

09:05.600 --> 09:07.636
<i>- O'Brian.
- We got a pattern.</i>

09:07.720 --> 09:10.359
Send me the hit.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.069
All interagency search protocols
are being run through CTU.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.515
Ken, no one is going around you.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.994
We'll make sure you're
apprised in real time.

09:19.079 --> 09:21.071
Audrey, I thought
you should know.

09:21.160 --> 09:25.119
Logan asked for Jack to be reinstated
provisionally with full autonomy.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.795
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.
This just happened.

09:28.880 --> 09:33.032
<i>On the inner casing, you will find
a display with a seven-digit readout.</i>

09:33.120 --> 09:36.556
<i>- I'll need that.
- Then what?</i>

09:36.640 --> 09:40.394
<i>Then I will program a new
chip for your remote tracker.</i>

09:40.480 --> 09:44.553
- Put me through to Jack Bauer.
- Voiceprint is a 95% match. It's Erwich.

09:44.640 --> 09:49.077
He was on a sat phone. I can't trace it,
but it originated from a land line downtown.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.153
<i>- I have Jack Bauer for you, sir.
- This is Bauer.</i>

09:53.240 --> 09:56.232
<i>- Jack, we may have a lead on Erwich.
- I'm listening.</i>

09:56.320 --> 09:59.630
We intercepted a call
between Erwich and an unknown associate.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.190
We weren't able to trace Erwich,
but may have the associate.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.714
22 North Figueroa, a penthouse.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.792
- Chloe, bring up the building manifest.
- On it.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.270
From what we heard, Erwich is
trying to acquire an activation code.

10:12.360 --> 10:18.151
He's reconfiguring the trigger to disperse
the Sentox. We're running out of time.

10:18.240 --> 10:22.791
OK, the penthouse is leased to a man
named Jacob Rossler. Cross-checking.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.715
He's a software programmer indicted for
security code infiltration, identity theft.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.110
I need schematics on the building
and vectors for every entrance.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.111
We'll have it for you.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.988
We're gonna need to go in covertly.
Have Curtis meet me with a small team,

10:37.080 --> 10:41.039
but tell them to stay out of sight
until I get there. We'll be in touch.

10:41.120 --> 10:46.558
This is our new destination.
They'll clear a landing zone for you.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.789
This building's security system
uses proprietary technology.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.270
It's a high-end platform
that's a bitch to hack into.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.828
- So get Edgar to help you.
- Spenser is better.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.530
Chloe, out of the question.

10:58.615 --> 11:01.391
Spenser can do this
faster than Edgar and l.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.075
<i>- He wrote a code that took months to hack.
- That's a bad idea.</i>

11:05.160 --> 11:09.517
Stay out of this! He didn't know Cummings
was dirty. His polygraph proved that.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.990
He was spying on us.
He was spying on you. He lied to you.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.039
Sir, if you don't let
Spenser help us do this,

11:16.124 --> 11:18.518
we're not gonna
get it done in time.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.836
He has to wear a security wristband
and be under supervision.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.911
Fine.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.709
<i>- Audrey Raines.
- Audrey, it's Jack.</i>

11:33.280 --> 11:36.410
I wanted to tell you
the president asked me

11:36.495 --> 11:39.753
to stay on until the
canisters were retrieved.

11:39.840 --> 11:44.038
Jack, you know what this means.
You'll be exposed. CTU can handle the crisis.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.272
<i>- The president thinks I can help.
- Jack, you don't owe them this.</i>

11:48.840 --> 11:51.638
The reason I called,
I need to ask you to do me a favour.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.119
What?

11:53.200 --> 11:57.910
- Kim doesn't know I'm alive yet.
- Do you want me to tell her?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.788
No, I want you to call and bring her
into CTU. I'll see her when I get back.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.838
<i>- All right.
- Are you sure you're comfortable doing this?</i>

12:04.920 --> 12:08.071
<i>- Of course.
- Thank you.</i>

12:08.160 --> 12:09.479
Sure.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.229
Your swing arm needs to be replaced.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.792
Yeah, we're open till five. Okey-doke.
Can I help you?

12:39.880 --> 12:44.271
Do you have some kind of precision tool
for cutting metal?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.635
- Sure.
- Where is everyone else?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.711
Lunch. Why?

12:50.240 --> 12:53.198
I need you to do some work for us
and we need it done fast.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.826
If you do it, you'll
live, do you understand?

12:55.911 --> 12:57.796
Yeah. Yeah. Just take it easy.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.871
Get the canisters.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.313
Why haven't I gotten an update?
Bauer left here on some sort of lead.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.119
Find out if CTU is any closer
to recovering the gas.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.191
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

13:28.040 --> 13:30.474
How are you feeling?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.118
Remarkably well...

13:32.200 --> 13:36.193
for someone whose husband tried
to have her committed without a goodbye.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.396
I'm sorry.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.040
I didn't come here to fight with you.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.750
You have every right to.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.830
The two of us used to be a pretty good team.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.115
Do you remember?

13:55.920 --> 14:00.391
I was the one you would
always come to first for advice.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.030
- I remember.
- We've got to get back to that relationship.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.314
You're right.
Things are gonna get rough for you.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.793
And you are gonna need me
and everything that I can give you.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.873
I don't know what to say, Marty.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.918
Don't you ever do that to me again.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.398
Mike, please, come in.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.230
- Mr President. Mrs Logan.
- Mike.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.880
Mike, I owe you a profound apology.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.430
You were in an impossible situation.
I understand what you did.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.115
No. I panicked, Mike. That's it.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.589
Plain and simple.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.194
I'm not proud of how I handled myself.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.397
I intend to make it right from this point on.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.150
- I would like you to resume your duties.
- Of course, sir.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.117
Thank you, Mike.

15:08.560 --> 15:15.113
CTU is tracking down the canisters, but we
have to deal with the issue of Cummings.

15:15.640 --> 15:20.111
It's all right, Mike.
I would like Martha's input on this.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.557
So, what do we do about Walt?
We can't detain him indefinitely.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.315
We keep him out of sight long enough
to construct a credible narrative.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.038
Mike,

15:30.120 --> 15:32.714
are you talking about a cover-up?

15:32.800 --> 15:38.079
I mean exercising discretion to spare
this country unnecessary humiliation.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.517
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.000
He has allowed terrorists
to get their hands

15:45.043 --> 15:47.720
on gas that is, at this
point, a very real threat.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.995
With respect, Mrs Logan,

15:50.080 --> 15:54.949
if we go public, the president's reputation
won't be the only casualty.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.999
The credibility of this
office will be destroyed.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.834
Charles, you are going to take a hit on this,
but it won't destroy you.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.799
You did nothing wrong
except to trust someone who betrayed you.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.075
You are human.

16:09.160 --> 16:13.039
You might be overestimating
the public's capacity for forgiveness.

16:13.120 --> 16:18.478
I'm not. The only thing
they won't forgive is being lied to.

16:18.560 --> 16:24.556
I think you should issue a statement
to the press. And the sooner the better.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.192
I agree.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.478
Why don't you and I work on it together
and see what we come up with?

16:32.560 --> 16:33.754
OK.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.719
Chloe.

16:41.800 --> 16:46.078
- Station three. We don't have much time.
- Thanks for getting me reinstated.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.118
I did it cos I need help
getting Jack through the building,

16:49.200 --> 16:51.509
not because I forgive you, because I don't.

16:51.600 --> 16:56.230
Have a seat. We need to gain access
to the security server at 22 North Figueroa.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.790
It's a proprietary network so get to work.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.690
Chloe, I swear, I
thought I was following...

17:07.775 --> 17:09.869
I don't care, Spenser.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.833
CTU. They've got eyes and ears
on the building.

17:44.920 --> 17:49.232
We've got two units.
One east, one west of the building.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.992
Chloe, do you copy?

17:52.080 --> 17:55.993
We're here. Spenser's countervailing
the building's security protocol.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.719
What? Spenser's under arrest.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.839
- Buchanan released him from Holding.
- Fine. Give me Rossler's position.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.830
I've hacked into the building's motion
sensors. Rossler is still in the penthouse.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.718
I have two guards on the penthouse level.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.509
<i>- What about the ground-level entrance?
- One guard, three cameras.</i>

18:15.600 --> 18:20.037
Stand by to take out all security cameras
covering the front desk and the elevators.

18:20.120 --> 18:24.796
I can only shut them down for 60 seconds,
then they reboot. That's as long as you have.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.190
Copy that. Teams A and B,
remain in position till you get a go.

18:28.280 --> 18:34.276
We are one minute out. We have to cross
the street to get to Rossler's building.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.154
We are ready to cut into the canisters.

18:41.240 --> 18:46.314
You have to cut precisely ten centimetres
from the bottom of the casing

18:46.400 --> 18:48.391
to reveal the trigger.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.436
How thick is the outer casing?

18:50.520 --> 18:55.799
<i>Five millimetres. Call me with
the ID numbers when you're done.</i>

19:12.360 --> 19:15.716
We're in position.
We're set. We're ready to go.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.910
<i>Just a few more seconds.</i>

19:21.200 --> 19:23.077
OK. Here we go, Jack.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.311
On my mark, cameras dark.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.276
Federal agent. Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

19:32.360 --> 19:34.430
Elevator code, let's have it.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.239
Four, zero, seven, three, pound.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.756
Unit one, status check. Lost cameras A and C.

19:40.840 --> 19:46.517
Tell him you don't know why the cameras
went down, but everything is OK.

19:46.600 --> 19:51.355
Base, status check blue. Don't know why the
cameras are out. Everything's fine down here.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.271
Turn around.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.920
Back up to me. Back up to me.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.993
- Where are the elevators?
- Almost there. You have two floors to go.

20:00.080 --> 20:04.358
The camera reboots in ten seconds.
Then you'll be visible.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.517
Move. Move.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.389
Unit one, status check. Where are you?

20:21.640 --> 20:24.279
You tell him you had to use the men's room.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.275
Base, headed to the men's room.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.271
Something's wrong.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.278
- Yes.
- Mr Rossler, we may have a situation.

20:47.360 --> 20:51.751
- What kind of situation?
- I'm not sure. Please remain in your office.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.916
The guards look suspicious.
One has an automatic weapon.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.479
Copy that.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.991
Federal agent!

21:07.680 --> 21:10.990
- You OK?
- Yeah. Go ahead. It hit my vest.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.398
- Rossler's on the move.
- Where?

21:14.480 --> 21:16.755
Nine o'clock.

21:23.680 --> 21:28.117
Federal agent.
Drop the weapon. Drop the weapon!

21:28.200 --> 21:31.078
Put your hands behind your head.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.832
Do it!

21:32.920 --> 21:34.990
Interlock your fingers.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.393
Rossler is in custody.
Repeat, Rossler is in custody.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.234
<i>- Move in. I need a medic.
- Patching you to situation room.</i>

21:46.320 --> 21:52.316
- Someone else is in the penthouse, Jack.
- In the bedroom. To your right. North side.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.713
- Curtis, cover him.
- I got him.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.314
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands!

22:08.120 --> 22:10.395
Don't shoot.

22:12.560 --> 22:16.473
- Who are you?
- I'm lnessa.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.313
Who did that to you?

22:19.400 --> 22:23.632
- You are the police?
- Counter Terrorist Unit, Los Angeles.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.913
He is holding me here.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.868
I want to go home.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.470
You need to cut into the outer casing
exactly ten centimetres from the bottom.

22:57.560 --> 23:02.793
The casing is five millimetres thick.
You cannot puncture the inner lining.

23:02.880 --> 23:07.237
- What's in these things?
- Do not worry. Just do what I say.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.279
Just... Can't you tell
me what this is all about?

23:11.360 --> 23:13.555
Do you have a family, Cal?

23:13.640 --> 23:15.153
A wife.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.279
My wife is in prison.
She's been there for seven years.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.598
Her only crime was to support me
while I fought for my country.

23:25.680 --> 23:30.310
My son lives in a state-run facility.
He does not even remember what I look like.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.868
You want to know what this is about?

23:32.960 --> 23:36.475
It's about justice.
It's about ending tyranny.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.272
When you're finished, we will leave.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.190
- You won't hurt me?
- You're not my enemy.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.033
Your government is my enemy.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.111
Hey.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.395
You have my word.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.071
Begin.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.558
It's all right. You're all right.

24:29.560 --> 24:33.712
<i>All right, alpha team,
the building is secure.</i>

24:35.080 --> 24:37.071
Take a seat.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.840
You're safe now.

24:44.360 --> 24:49.275
Get a medic to have a look at her.
I want CTU to run a full background check.

24:49.360 --> 24:55.356
I don't mind that they've dressed his wound,
but don't give him anything for the pain.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.596
Curtis, put him in a chair.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.274
All right, let's go. Get him up.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.071
Easy on my leg.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.433
My name is Jack Bauer. I'm with CTU.

25:20.520 --> 25:25.150
25 minutes ago, you contacted a man named
lvan Erwich. What did he want you to do?

25:25.240 --> 25:29.119
- I want my lawyer.
- You'll get a lawyer when I get what I need.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.988
Mr Erwich is in possession
of 20 canisters of Sentox VX nerve gas,

25:33.080 --> 25:36.675
which he has threatened to deploy
here in the United States.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.354
I guess you have a problem.

25:41.920 --> 25:46.232
No, you have a problem. You've been
conspiring with and aiding a known terrorist,

25:46.320 --> 25:49.551
which means I get to hold you
for as long as I want.

25:49.640 --> 25:54.191
Mr Erwich can't deploy the canisters unless
he reconfigures the trigger mechanism.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.510
Is that what he wanted you to do?

25:58.360 --> 26:03.036
Trust me. You don't want
to go down this road with me.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.759
Go to hell.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.231
Agh!

26:12.320 --> 26:17.030
That is exactly where I'm going to send you
unless you start to cooperate.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.073
You like hurting girls?

26:22.160 --> 26:24.594
Curtis.

26:26.120 --> 26:31.035
<i>By the time I'm finished with you,
you're gonna wish you felt this good again.</i>

26:31.120 --> 26:33.111
Where is Erwich?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.709
I want full immunity,

26:44.800 --> 26:47.314
unfreezing of all my assets,

26:47.400 --> 26:51.029
and transport
to a foreign country of my choosing.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.711
No.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.391
And lnessa.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.550
She comes with me.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.029
That's the deal.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.795
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
We're not making a deal.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.314
Curtis.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.909
- Jack, it's Lynn.
- Go ahead.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.673
We don't have the luxury
to engage in brinkmanship.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.833
- He's gonna tell us what we want to know.
- We're not gonna wait to find out.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.559
Accept the deal. That's an order.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.357
Fine. It's your call.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.670
We're signing off.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.832
Make sure he follows through.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.152
I've been instructed to accept your proposal.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.714
A certified agreement,

27:58.800 --> 28:01.234
signed by the attorney general.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.676
When I see that, I'll tell you what you want.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.638
And remember, I want lnessa.

28:23.200 --> 28:26.272
Your agreement's being drawn up.
Now I want something.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.999
Where's Erwich?

28:29.080 --> 28:31.594
I have no idea.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.194
I don't know the man.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.430
Not even what he looks like.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.432
I first spoke with him 30 minutes ago.

28:39.520 --> 28:43.399
We were put in contact
through a mutual associate in Russia.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.711
- Who?
- Sergei Voronov.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.950
A commander in the resistance movement.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.352
- What does Erwich want?
- To reprogram the chip of that trigger.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.000
He's calling back
with the identification keys.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.072
- What's your time frame?
- Within the hour.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.833
How is he going to receive the package?

29:02.840 --> 29:07.675
I was going to deliver it.
We haven't agreed on the meeting place.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.551
I want that chip.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.076
It's in a safe place.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.436
Once I see some paperwork,

29:17.520 --> 29:19.670
I'll show it to you.

29:22.280 --> 29:28.276
I want you to be ready to fit that chip
with a transponder so we can track him.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.911
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.070
Where are we with Rossler's agreement?

29:38.160 --> 29:42.233
We have the attorney general's sanction.
You should have it in a few minutes.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.950
- Did we get any information on the girl?
- There isn't much. Inessa Kovalesky.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.395
Reported missing 19 months ago from Kiev.

29:49.480 --> 29:53.519
The assumption is she was kidnapped
by traffickers in the sex-slave trade.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.670
She's 15, Jack.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.955
15?

30:01.160 --> 30:04.118
OK, thanks, Bill. I'll get back to you.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.754
- You can't take the girl.
- Then no deal.

30:22.840 --> 30:28.198
You'll have your immunity, your freedom.
Leave the girl out of this.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.919
Inessa is all I care about.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.673
She comes with me,

30:34.760 --> 30:37.228
or you lose Erwich.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.310
I've almost finished the protocols.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.233
Whatever you have,
port it over to Edgar's station.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.754
- Why?
- He'll be finishing that task.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.434
Fine.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.876
- Chloe, don't you understand?
- I know.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.798
I'll bet you do.

31:08.880 --> 31:13.556
You don't work here any more, Spenser.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.155
Your reinstatement was just until
we got Rossler into custody.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.279
- There's still stuff that has to be done.
- We pulled people from Division.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.590
These men will escort you out.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.909
I know that was hard.
You did the right thing.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.991
Shut up, Edgar.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.835
You're right, we don't need that part.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.399
OK.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.597
"I promise a full and open inquiry
into this matter."

31:57.680 --> 32:02.515
"I will not rest until I've restored the
faith that you have placed in this office."

32:02.600 --> 32:05.442
"And I can demonstrate to
you, the American people,

32:05.527 --> 32:07.833
that I bear its mantle
of responsibility

32:07.920 --> 32:11.515
with respect and deep humility."

32:11.600 --> 32:15.070
This way, you're assuming responsibility
for WaIt's actions,

32:15.160 --> 32:20.996
but you're also personally taking the
initiative to bring him to justice.

32:21.080 --> 32:24.709
Well, I'd like to run it by Mike,
but I think it works.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.678
I think it's the right move, Charles.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.916
Thank you for letting me help you.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.434
I'm glad to have your help.

32:33.519 --> 32:36.994
It's been a long time since you
and I worked together like this.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.794
Yes.

32:41.880 --> 32:45.077
<i>- Mr President, Mike.
- What is it, Mike?</i>

32:45.600 --> 32:48.717
<i>I think you should come here,
I'm in the west hallway.</i>

32:48.800 --> 32:51.837
- What's going on?
- Just come here, sir.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.911
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

33:41.800 --> 33:43.950
Cut him down.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.757
Thanks for meeting me. You got the money?

34:32.840 --> 34:35.274
Jenny, I'm not here to bring you money.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.987
Here's the name of a doctor. He's a good man.

34:40.080 --> 34:44.790
I want you to call him. I'll pay all
the expenses. It won't cost you a cent.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.348
- We'll call him together.
- I can't.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.952
- Oh, God!
- Don't hurt him!

34:51.040 --> 34:54.112
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:59.640 --> 35:01.278
Hurry up.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.272
Let's go.

35:05.360 --> 35:08.079
- I'm so sorry, Lynn.
- Come on!

35:25.000 --> 35:28.709
Rossler's been given a shot for the pain.
We have pursuit units on stand-by.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.836
As soon as he moves out, we'll be ready.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.469
No one's going anywhere unless Erwich calls.
Stand by the phones.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.551
Excuse me.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.232
<i>- Audrey Raines.
- It's me. Did you get a hold of Kim?</i>

35:49.320 --> 35:53.279
No. I tried her, but she wasn't in.
I left a message.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.113
- Would you mind trying again for me?
- Of course.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.191
OK, thanks.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.879
I want to contact my family.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.679
They must be so worried about me.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.515
I need to explain something to you first.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.151
Please, sit down.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.109
For now...

36:37.200 --> 36:40.909
we need you to go with Mr Rossler.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.434
Just for now.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.752
Men like me - agents -
are going to follow you.

36:47.840 --> 36:50.229
And when we get
what we need from Mr Rossler,

36:50.320 --> 36:54.916
they're going to move in
and they're going to take you away from him.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.912
You don't know what he does to me
when we are alone.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.355
I promise I won't let him be alone with you.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.034
- I don't believe you.
- Please.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.509
- I won't do it.
- Please.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.279
Let me go.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.954
- Please.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.677
Then you are no different than Rossler.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.069
I am not Rossler.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.754
Look at me.

37:25.840 --> 37:29.469
I won't let anything happen to you.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.551
I promise.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.038
We need you to get dressed, please.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.911
Thank you.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.589
Good job.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.674
That's it.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.036
Load the canisters. Get rid of the body.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.231
Pick it up.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.955
Yes.

38:59.040 --> 39:04.114
We have the identification keys.
I'm messaging them to you now.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.519
I've got them.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.797
How long will it take
to reprogram the chip and deliver it?

39:08.880 --> 39:10.677
<i>I'll be ready in ten minutes.</i>

39:10.760 --> 39:13.718
<i>- We need a place we can meet.
- You're coming personally?</i>

39:13.800 --> 39:17.839
Unless you have someone who can install
and program an encoded binary chip.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.070
I'll call you back with the location.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.151
<i>I'll be here.</i>

39:26.000 --> 39:29.117
Get him set up for a wire. I'll get the girl.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.679
Yes, sir.

39:30.760 --> 39:35.834
Mr Rossler, in a minute
we're gonna be implanting a transmitter.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.353
We're ready to go.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.435
It's going to be fine.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.672
Let's go.

40:05.160 --> 40:11.156
We couldn't complete the trace, but we
have it narrowed down to a ten-block radius.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.515
<i>No! No!</i>

40:13.600 --> 40:15.556
No! Hold your fire.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.069
Get a medic in here now.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.389
Inessa, give me the gun.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.075
I know you don't want to hurt anybody else.

40:31.440 --> 40:34.477
Is he gonna make it?

40:35.400 --> 40:37.960
No. He's dead.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.395
He was our only link to those canisters.

40:40.480 --> 40:45.838
Erwich's gonna call here any minute
and he's gonna expect to talk to him.
