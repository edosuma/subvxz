01:03.897 --> 01:05.465
- It doesn't make
any sense at all.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.001
You think it's a lot of money
so your mind's telling you

01:08.001 --> 01:10.271
oh, don't spend any more,
it's just for kicks.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.006
This pissweak little
voice inside your head

01:14.442 --> 01:16.344
is telling you to accept
lesser quality.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.213
Like even though you're willing

01:19.213 --> 01:20.714
to spend your hard earned cash

01:20.714 --> 01:22.816
on what is already an
expensive purchase,

01:22.816 --> 01:25.219
this little voice is telling you

01:25.219 --> 01:28.489
to accept poor quality
on your investment.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.091
But any way you look at it
that's third world economics.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.094
Invest more, I say, go for gold.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.129
Compared to your
initial purchase,

01:35.129 --> 01:36.664
percentage wise, it's low.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.167
And your friends are
going to be happier.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.168
It's a gift.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.077
And now you're happy.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.213
- Thank you.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.916
- I've got some people
you need to meet.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.429
- Your house is huge!

03:16.764 --> 03:18.632
- You like it?
- I like it a lot.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.601
- I love my house.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.371
- This is yours?
- This is my house.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.605
After you.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.400
I'm ready.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.122
It's awfully quiet.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.793
- Sounds like bliss.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.096
- Domestic bliss?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.434
- Relax.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.968
- Well I would.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.070
But I see things
that need to be done.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.573
Can't help wanting to be the
one to do them now, can I?

06:12.573 --> 06:13.874
- You're a saint.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.375
- I am what I am.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.777
- I'm not listening.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.951
- Yet you still hear me.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.498
- The Charlington
Estate is huge.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.299
It's like a maze.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.601
You literally have
to get there by boat.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.035
They have their own wharf.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.339
We hunt them in pairs.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.643
We give them a 90-second head
start and then we head off.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.712
Most guys, they run.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.580
Sweating, creaming their pants,

07:26.580 --> 07:27.981
but no, no, no, no, not us.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.883
See they only hide
from the ugly ones.

07:34.021 --> 07:38.358
You know they, have their
own nine-hole golf course?

07:40.193 --> 07:43.030
- I'd kill for my
own golf course.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.508
Be my guest.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.044
Wouldn't be the first time.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.230
- Bit much, don't you think?

08:19.700 --> 08:20.534
- I agree.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.462
- Sweet!

08:54.902 --> 08:57.571
- You're good, you're very good.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.982
The floor's warped.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.785
- Oh yeah, yeah, there's
a lot of width in here.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.589
Man, I am getting
sick of winnings!

09:29.302 --> 09:30.971
- I don't feel well.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.609
- Shy will get you nowhere.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.992
You're beautiful.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.051
- To your god-awful rich parents

10:18.051 --> 10:19.820
and their snooty
little country club.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.721
- To mummy!

10:24.424 --> 10:26.359
Now, to the winner
go the spoils.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.162
Pour it yourself, Richie Rich.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.919
- You have to be such a cunt?

10:53.420 --> 10:54.621
- Takes one to know one.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.825
- Indeed it does.

11:22.716 --> 11:23.550
- Hi.

11:26.419 --> 11:31.424
I'm Lewis Henry Robinson
, at your service.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.729
I'm Lewis, Lewis Henry Robinson.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.431
I'm Lewis Henry Robinson.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.834
Hi, I'm Lewis Henry Robinson.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.704
At your service.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.563
I'm Lewis Henry Robinson
at your service.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.636
A whisky neat, thank you.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.711
I used to sneak into a joint
like this when I was 15.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.380
With my brother's ID.

13:33.380 --> 13:38.385
And now, here we are stuck
in this miniature time warp,

13:39.786 --> 13:41.388
just 15 years too late
for the party.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.428
To time travel,

13:49.863 --> 13:52.232
and for those who aren't
afraid to get a little dizzy.

13:55.768 --> 13:59.606
- Warp speed.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.283
Technically speaking,

14:10.283 --> 14:11.751
warp speed isn't time travel.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.121
- Is that so?

14:14.121 --> 14:16.389
- Well, you know, it's
more like hyper drive.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.690
You see, matter
doesn't just disappear

14:17.690 --> 14:19.192
and reappear someplace else.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.329
You just get to where you're
going a hell of a lot faster.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.763
- And where's that?

14:23.763 --> 14:25.966
- Well if I knew that it
wouldn't be near as much fun.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.435
Sorry.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.937
I'm such an idiot.

14:44.417 --> 14:48.788
- If you could time
travel, where would you?

14:48.788 --> 14:49.622
- Back.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.726
- Reason?
- Fix my fuck ups.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.965
You?

14:57.965 --> 14:58.798
- Fast forward.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.501
- But that'd be cheating.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.111
- Do you really
need to be in here?

15:45.312 --> 15:46.646
- He's handsome.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.689
- I should go home.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.160
- No way, I'm not let
letting you run away.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.161
He's perfect.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.065
- I'm not you.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.901
- He likes you.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.872
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.208
Okay then, let's leave.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.709
And then what?

16:16.709 --> 16:20.280
Sit around at home, trying
not to think about him?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.116
Others?

16:26.886 --> 16:27.787
- I could do that.

16:56.015 --> 16:56.849
- You're back.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.754
I thought you might have fast
forwarded to somewhere better.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.656
- Evidently not.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.824
- Lewis Henry Robinson.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.327
At your service.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.730
But you probably
already knew that.

17:12.964 --> 17:16.303
- Nice to meet you again,
Lewis Henry Robinson.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.482
- You're forever
pushing me away.

17:34.987 --> 17:35.855
See-saw,

17:37.290 --> 17:38.158
she saw.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.362
Buckle up, kiddos.

17:43.863 --> 17:47.567
- The key to survival is the
end of this sad, deluded idea

17:47.567 --> 17:50.337
that we actually
possess a soul.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.972
- And here I was
thinking it was food and shelter.

17:52.972 --> 17:57.977
- Well no, the end of fatalism
religion, magic, rebirth,

17:59.446 --> 18:01.914
all of these delusions that
have crept into our psyches

18:01.914 --> 18:03.916
without our even being
aware of them, gone.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
All those smart enough
to accept everything

18:05.918 --> 18:09.622
that's unchangeable,
life, death, randomness,

18:10.957 --> 18:12.959
they're going to be the winners.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.095
Or it could be nothing,
nothing at all.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.267
- My money's on nothing.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.001
- So you're a gambler?

18:22.001 --> 18:23.603
- Oh, everyone gambles.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.205
Most people just
aren't awake enough

18:25.205 --> 18:27.039
to realize that's
what they're doing.

18:28.675 --> 18:33.680
So, in this unique brand
of anarchy you subscribe to

18:35.748 --> 18:36.916
what's off limits?

24:51.991 --> 24:52.825
- Hey!

24:54.393 --> 24:56.262
That is no way to treat a host.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.434
Come back!

25:02.434 --> 25:03.636
You are fun!

25:07.907 --> 25:09.842
Come back!

25:09.842 --> 25:11.310
- Oi.

25:50.817 --> 25:55.822
- Kenny, where's the party at?

25:56.823 --> 25:57.657
Kenny?

26:05.832 --> 26:06.666
Kenneth?

26:41.300 --> 26:42.301
Bloody hell.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.969
I can explain.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.344
Kenneth is a monster.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.306
Can we talk this through?

29:20.292 --> 29:22.628
Sarah Rachel Montrose.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.499
34 Clauson Parade, Lillyvale.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.570
You came a hell of a
long way to get laid.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.417
- You come any closer and
I'll slice your balls off.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.685
I'll do it, fucker.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.487
- Yes, you're quite capable.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.356
- Give me my bag.
- Come on Sarah,

29:50.356 --> 29:52.859
let's just talk about this--
- Now!

29:54.126 --> 29:55.761
- Come and get it.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.029
- You can't
leave without it.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.598
- Just give me bag
and then I'm leaving.

29:59.598 --> 30:00.967
I should call the cops.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.469
- Oh, you wanna call the cops?

30:04.871 --> 30:05.704
Call the cops.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.977
He raped me.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.211
You raped me.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.712
You set me up to be
raped by your friend.

30:13.712 --> 30:16.248
- Rape is such an ugly word.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.349
- There's a reason for that.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.484
- Yeah well, you just got

30:18.484 --> 30:19.618
more than you bargained
for, didn't you?

30:19.618 --> 30:22.021
It's hardly an
excuse to kill a man.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.489
And let's say you
did go to the police,

30:23.489 --> 30:25.724
I'm positive there
would be CCTV footage

30:25.724 --> 30:27.559
of you and me leaving
the club together.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.062
And if pushed, I would have
to tell the police the truth,

30:30.062 --> 30:32.531
that you were simply a horny
pick-up who wanted to party.

30:32.531 --> 30:37.536
Officer, it was
just me and my friend.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.839
We were just having a good time
and she fuckin' killed him,

30:40.839 --> 30:43.542
she killed him with
a fucking golf club.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.244
Jesus!

30:45.244 --> 30:47.446
Maybe I should call the police.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.115
- What if you couldn't
call the police?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.384
- That's interesting.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.619
But there's no guarantee.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.789
It would just get messy,

30:57.789 --> 31:00.792
and it's already pretty
messy, wouldn't you say?

31:00.792 --> 31:01.627
- He's right.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.431
- Listen, neither of us wants
this to follow us around

31:05.431 --> 31:07.133
for the rest of
our lives, do we?

31:07.133 --> 31:09.301
We need to work
together on this.

31:09.301 --> 31:12.471
We bury the body
someplace far away.

31:12.471 --> 31:15.707
We do it together and we
are bound to eternal secrecy

31:15.707 --> 31:17.009
because of our complicity.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.081
- And then what?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.382
- If anyone asks,
we'll just say Kenneth

31:23.382 --> 31:25.317
wasn't in when we got
back from the club.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.220
He'll just become
another missing persons stat.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.526
Sarah.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.730
- I keep the knife.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.332
- Good girl.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.069
- Better yet, I'll
give you a shovel.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.133
We need time to work this out.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.434
Just keep your distance.

32:17.069 --> 32:17.936
- I killed him.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.573
- You were amazing.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.377
We're good together.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.049
- He knows where
we fucking live.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.386
- You were saying?

32:35.587 --> 32:37.289
- You look like you've
done this before.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.034
- I won't stop you.
- Oh, you couldn't.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.904
- Did you get bullied at school?

32:52.904 --> 32:55.741
- Don't try and
justify what you did.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.513
- Don't cut yourself.

33:22.501 --> 33:27.506
Okay.

33:31.277 --> 33:32.111
Ready, Kenny?

33:35.013 --> 33:35.847
Oh, shit.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.339
Just going to wash up.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.337
He's not going to
jump in by himself.

35:07.406 --> 35:10.209
I get it, I really do,
but I'm not interested

35:10.209 --> 35:12.411
in having two dead
bodies to dispose of.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.945
- Neither am I.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.447
- Then grab a leg.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.753
One, two, three!

36:15.274 --> 36:16.808
Why didn't you call the police?

36:21.313 --> 36:24.483
It's too late now,
but you could have.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.894
- He thinks you're
hiding something.

36:45.237 --> 36:48.840
- That fucked up vanishing
trick, you played that before?

36:50.376 --> 36:51.943
- Not with the same result.

36:53.111 --> 36:55.080
- He ever
line one up for you?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.215
- I don't need help.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.786
So that's your thing,

37:00.786 --> 37:03.389
you bait women into being
fucked by your friend.

37:06.091 --> 37:06.925
How charitable?

37:10.829 --> 37:11.930
- I lost at golf.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.165
- What?

37:14.165 --> 37:15.934
- I let Kenny win, of course,

37:15.934 --> 37:20.071
makes him feel better about
himself, his pathetic life.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.474
And he doesn't charge me rent.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.876
- You lose a game on purpose.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.545
You bring home somebody to rape.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.920
You think you're special.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.697
- What'd it feel
like to kill him?

37:45.697 --> 37:48.133
- It felt
like someone else.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.401
- What about when
Kenny entered you,

37:49.401 --> 37:50.536
did that feel like
someone else too?

37:50.536 --> 37:52.070
- You're a piece of shit.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.672
- Oh, you get what you
deserve in this life.

37:53.672 --> 37:54.873
- More two-bit philosophy.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.075
- Think of it like
reverse karma.

37:57.075 --> 37:59.110
Whatever happens to you
is kind of zen, you know?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.779
Kenneth, he deserved to die.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.713
- Told you.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.181
- And I deserved to be raped?

38:03.181 --> 38:04.850
- I don't believe any victim
has a right to complain.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.051
You either get what you deserve

38:06.051 --> 38:07.853
or you learn a
valuable life lesson.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.288
- So where
does that leave you?

38:10.288 --> 38:12.958
- Me, I'm merely the
provider, a fixer.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.563
- And what's the
valuable life lesson

38:17.563 --> 38:19.498
I'm meant to have
learnt from all this?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.534
- Well, you're
really the only one

38:22.534 --> 38:23.735
who knows the answer to that.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.137
- Hmm, well, how
convenient for you?

38:26.137 --> 38:28.273
- But if I was to hazard a
guess, perhaps it would be

38:28.273 --> 38:30.075
something about
understanding your power.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.977
- She's got one hell of a swing.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.579
- Your power over men.

38:33.579 --> 38:38.016
See, males are inherently
weak, well, most males.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.852
That's why some men insist
women cover their faces,

38:40.852 --> 38:42.087
their bodies.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.989
You know, it lessens
the female power.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.758
But you walk into a bar
dressed like you are tonight

38:46.758 --> 38:48.727
and you have incredible power.

38:51.363 --> 38:52.698
You're a beautiful woman.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.332
- If you're looking
for a sympathy fuck,

38:54.332 --> 38:56.001
you're talking to
the wrong girl.

38:57.536 --> 39:00.338
- The value of things is random.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.073
Take my car for example.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.711
I buy it for X amount of
dollars and it seems like a lot

39:05.711 --> 39:07.245
but one could argue

39:07.245 --> 39:09.448
that now it makes for
a pretty cheap hearse.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.250
But there's an
exception to the rule.

39:12.250 --> 39:17.255
There is one thing in this
life whose value is not random

39:18.524 --> 39:21.326
but biologically predetermined
and in fact vital

39:21.326 --> 39:23.161
for our continuation
as a species.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.032
- Her pussy.
- Your pussy.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.635
Maybe this has all been about

39:29.635 --> 39:33.939
you acknowledging how your
pussy has affected your life.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.707
And you know, it'll take
time for you to understand.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.909
Your mind's been
programmed since childhood.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.177
You imagine things
that aren't real.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.378
- Fuck you, Lewis.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.980
- Things
that you think you want

39:41.980 --> 39:46.552
and then something like
this, random happens.

39:50.422 --> 39:51.957
And it changes everything.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.097
- There's nothing random
about what you did.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.904
- Well, could have been anyone
sitting on that bar stool.

41:13.505 --> 41:16.542
- As fucked up as he is,
you've got to admit he's hot.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.244
- He's sick.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.046
- Exactly.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.116
- Yeah, you're not helping.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.518
- Okay.

41:26.518 --> 41:29.454
I'm just not sure what
I'm supposed to do here.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.289
Sneak up behind him?

41:31.289 --> 41:33.424
- You're full of shit
ideas, just like him.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.421
- Straight to the grave.

42:03.421 --> 42:04.956
No drags marks, hmm?

42:42.027 --> 42:43.361
Three, two, one!

43:08.086 --> 43:09.254
- My knickers,

43:17.495 --> 43:18.596
if you don't mind.

45:43.508 --> 45:44.509
- I'm sorry.

48:04.015 --> 48:07.818
- I need you
to say you're sorry.

48:07.818 --> 48:10.288
- It wouldn't
change a thing.

48:11.689 --> 48:14.993
- I need you to say you're
sorry for what you did to me.

48:14.993 --> 48:16.661
- It would be a
hollow statement.

48:17.762 --> 48:19.564
It's important, for me.

48:21.967 --> 48:22.934
In words,

48:23.868 --> 48:24.702
written.

48:26.337 --> 48:27.838
I know you don't understand

48:27.838 --> 48:30.508
but I need to be able to
look at that one day and--

48:30.508 --> 48:31.409
- What's it worth?

48:32.777 --> 48:36.481
- This is no
longer a game, Lewis.

48:41.519 --> 48:42.520
- How about a drink?

48:53.398 --> 48:54.232
This is

48:56.501 --> 48:58.503
a lot harder than I
thought it would be.

49:06.644 --> 49:07.445
- Happy now?

49:10.781 --> 49:12.984
- You have no idea what
you've done, do you?

49:14.385 --> 49:15.686
- What I've done?

49:18.556 --> 49:19.824
What I've done.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.362
What about what you've done?

49:24.362 --> 49:26.264
You have a short term
memory, don't you?

50:09.940 --> 50:11.309
- I presume you're Lewis.

50:12.310 --> 50:13.444
- Correct.

50:13.444 --> 50:14.945
- Oh, thank goodness.

50:14.945 --> 50:16.914
I thought we were going to
be stuck out here all night.

50:16.914 --> 50:18.183
- The flight from hell.

50:20.818 --> 50:22.487
We're Kenneth's parents.

50:22.487 --> 50:26.091
- Oh.

50:36.701 --> 50:37.702
- Do you mind?

50:40.771 --> 50:45.076
- Of course.

50:45.076 --> 50:46.244
Please, come in.

50:47.412 --> 50:48.379
- Thank you.

50:53.784 --> 50:54.552
- I'm Michael.

50:56.421 --> 50:58.823
- Great.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.591
- Grab the other
bag, would you Louie?

51:13.371 --> 51:14.705
- He's not here.

51:16.907 --> 51:18.609
Where's my boy?

51:18.609 --> 51:20.378
- We were hoping
you could tell us.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.014
- This is Sarah,

51:25.015 --> 51:26.517
my girlfriend.

51:29.254 --> 51:33.558
- Sarah, this is Kenny,
Kenneth's folks, Michael and--

51:33.558 --> 51:35.326
- You're wearing
Kenneth's clothes.

51:37.862 --> 51:40.030
- It's nice to meet you.

51:41.966 --> 51:43.234
- Big night?

51:43.234 --> 51:46.337
- We um, actually,
we just got home.

51:47.872 --> 51:49.174
- And Kenneth?

51:49.174 --> 51:52.710
- Well mean, he wasn't
here when we got back.

51:52.710 --> 51:55.346
- I spoke to him from Dubai.

51:55.346 --> 51:57.782
- And he knew you were
getting in this late?

51:57.782 --> 51:58.816
- Yes.

51:59.817 --> 52:01.018
- He never mentioned it.

52:01.018 --> 52:03.388
He loves his
surprises, does Kenny.

52:05.356 --> 52:06.991
- Would have been a
surprise if he had shown up.

52:06.991 --> 52:09.794
- Oh well if it wasn't for
that rubbish airline you booked

52:09.794 --> 52:11.596
I'd be home relaxing already.

52:15.433 --> 52:16.867
- And where is home?

52:17.902 --> 52:19.637
- Sanctuary Heights.

52:19.637 --> 52:20.638
- Great golf course.

52:21.672 --> 52:23.508
- I don't understand.

52:23.508 --> 52:25.710
I've called him a dozen times
and he doesn't call back.

52:25.710 --> 52:27.978
- I have exactly the
same problem with Kenny.

52:27.978 --> 52:30.681
He never answers his
phone.

52:30.681 --> 52:32.383
Look, I'm sure he's fine.

52:32.383 --> 52:34.285
Probably just holed
up with friends.

52:34.285 --> 52:35.520
He'll be here any minute.

52:37.054 --> 52:38.656
- I need a hot shower.

52:38.656 --> 52:39.557
- Of course.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.927
- Oh yes, go and
look after your back.

52:42.927 --> 52:46.130
- You, ah, obviously
know where everything is.

52:47.298 --> 52:49.934
- I ought to, I built it.

52:49.934 --> 52:52.503
- Oh, very beautiful.

52:52.503 --> 52:55.005
- As much as Kenneth
likes to think it's his.

53:03.481 --> 53:04.349
- Cup of tea?

53:14.492 --> 53:15.326
- Well.

53:36.481 --> 53:38.182
- Still feeling
bad about Kenneth?

53:42.687 --> 53:43.688
- Not so much.

53:57.167 --> 53:59.504
- Kenneth never really
told me much about you.

54:01.939 --> 54:05.976
He did say he's enjoying
the extra company.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.745
- Oh, that
makes two of us.

54:09.280 --> 54:10.648
- So, how did you meet?

54:12.783 --> 54:13.784
- Funny thing,

54:15.185 --> 54:18.656
we actually met right
there in the lounge room.

54:26.331 --> 54:28.165
Through a mutual friend.

54:28.165 --> 54:31.502
- He is a social creature.
- Yes he is.

54:31.502 --> 54:32.803
- Who's a creature?

54:32.803 --> 54:33.971
- Ah, Kenny.

54:33.971 --> 54:36.441
I was just telling Mrs Hanson--

54:36.441 --> 54:37.908
- Oh, Sophia.

54:37.908 --> 54:42.146
- Oh, I was just telling
Sophia how Kenny and I met.

54:42.146 --> 54:45.316
- Hmm, well maybe if
Sophia would like to hear

54:45.316 --> 54:46.917
how I met Kenny too.

54:48.018 --> 54:48.853
- You think?

54:50.688 --> 54:54.425
- Oh, this is not like him,
not to be here when we arrive.

55:00.965 --> 55:02.700
Why are you sorry, Lewis?

55:05.336 --> 55:06.971
- That's um.

55:08.573 --> 55:11.876
- Darn, it's part of this
silly housekeeping system

55:11.876 --> 55:13.478
the boys came up with. - Yeah.

55:14.779 --> 55:16.481
- Whenever one of them
leaves a dirty plate

55:16.481 --> 55:18.783
laying around the house
or a takeaway container,

55:18.783 --> 55:21.386
or whatever, the other person
has to write a sorry note.

55:21.386 --> 55:24.489
- The first
person to write five

55:24.489 --> 55:26.491
gives the other
person 50 dollars.

55:26.491 --> 55:27.392
- Oh ,

55:29.827 --> 55:31.696
well someone's making a fortune.

55:31.696 --> 55:33.364
- I'm afraid it's not me.

55:33.364 --> 55:36.867
- Persistence
is the key

55:36.867 --> 55:38.503
to good housekeeping, Lewis.

55:38.503 --> 55:40.405
- Very true.
- Very true.

55:41.472 --> 55:44.074
- That, and good appliances.

55:44.074 --> 55:45.209
You know, we bought Kenneth

55:45.209 --> 55:47.077
the best vacuum cleaner
money could buy.

55:48.579 --> 55:50.415
Perhaps we should
have got him a maid.

55:52.149 --> 55:53.651
- Kenny would love a maid.

56:30.354 --> 56:33.724
- If you fuck this up,
then we are both done for.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.826
- So boy genius, come morning

56:35.826 --> 56:38.028
and Kenneth still
isn't here, what then?

56:39.430 --> 56:42.232
- He knew they were coming
tonight and never said a word.

56:42.232 --> 56:43.868
- He's laughing
his arse off now.

56:45.302 --> 56:47.738
- Little cunt.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.607
It's in the genes.

56:59.650 --> 57:00.885
- What the fuck?

57:01.886 --> 57:03.120
Do you have any idea

57:03.120 --> 57:05.456
what this is doing in
the boot of my car?

57:06.757 --> 57:07.658
- Your car?

57:09.426 --> 57:10.360
- Yes.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.195
- Oh those?

57:11.195 --> 57:12.029
They're um.

57:13.698 --> 57:15.232
- They're props.

57:15.232 --> 57:16.767
- Yeah.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.504
- Kenneth offered to drive
me to rehearsal tomorrow.

57:20.738 --> 57:22.339
- Sarah's a performer.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.808
- Actress.

57:23.808 --> 57:26.477
Just amateur stuff you
know, local theater group.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.848
Kenny said to put
them in the boot.

57:34.652 --> 57:35.486
- Props?

57:36.721 --> 57:37.822
- Mm-hmm.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.191
- Yeah, we're doing
The Firewalkers.

57:41.191 --> 57:43.293
- Oh, it's great.

57:43.293 --> 57:48.298
- The El Boging Secundo
laundered his bloody underpants

57:49.767 --> 57:52.002
and handkerchief stiff and
crackly with black sputum.

57:52.002 --> 57:54.371
- This is crap!

57:54.371 --> 57:55.640
Where is Kenneth?

57:55.640 --> 57:57.875
What the fuck are
you talking about?

57:57.875 --> 58:02.179
- Sophia, what
she's talking about

58:02.179 --> 58:05.349
is a pair
of bloody underpants.

58:07.652 --> 58:09.520
Why don't you try them on?

58:09.520 --> 58:11.421
- What?

58:11.421 --> 58:13.057
- Well, it might bring
back fond memories

58:13.057 --> 58:15.059
of you being young
enough to menstruate.

58:16.193 --> 58:17.795
- You little prick!

58:25.402 --> 58:26.236
Oh.

59:56.827 --> 59:57.662
- Sophie?

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:08.605
Sophia!

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:13.243
Sophie.

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:16.546
Where are you darling?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.449
Sophie!

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:25.122
Oh my God!

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.234
- Maybe we should just leave.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.972
Leave everything.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.270
- I see things that
need to be done.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:08.718
- Thank you.

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:13.090
- To getting a little dizzy.

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.675
- Kenny have
any brothers or sisters

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:33.210
likely to pop in?

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:36.713
- Only child.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:37.547
- Hmm,

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:40.284
clean sweep.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.153
- Thanks to you.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:54.698
- I can feel everything.

01:03:59.203 --> 01:04:02.106
- You're more like
me than you know.

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.178
- Maybe I am.

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.768
Maybe we're all a bit like you.

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:49.920
- No, no wait, wait!

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.488
No, no, no, no, no!

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:27.224
- What the fuck?

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.495
Sarah!

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:33.597
Fuck!

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:35.399
Sarah.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.603
Sarah.

01:05:41.005 --> 01:05:41.838
No, no, no.

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:43.073
Sarah, you do not!

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.541
You do not have to do this.

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.212
Sarah, please, please.

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:51.948
You do not, you do
not have to do this.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.882
- Don't talk.

01:06:07.431 --> 01:06:09.866
- Hi, we're in this together.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.237
Remember?

01:06:13.237 --> 01:06:16.906
- Look, it's okay that you
don't give a shit about me,

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:18.675
or anyone else.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.277
It actually makes this easier.

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:21.111
- No.

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:23.613
We were wrong.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.716
I, I see that now.

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.685
- Words Lewis,

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:31.788
they're just words.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.723
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:35.525
It's a bad habit
of mine but please,

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:38.462
I just have a lot on
my mind right now.

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.130
Is that really

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.399
what you want your
last words to be?

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.300
- Fuck you!

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.936
You think you can
walk away from this?

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:52.142
I'm, I'm truly sorry.

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:55.045
Sarah I'm, I'm truly sorry.

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:56.446
- You don't want to do this.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:58.415
Why?

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.587
- Because I hurt you.

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:04.821
- Let's just leave.

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:06.690
- You keep trying
to ruin my life.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.857
- Is that all I'm doing?

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.259
- That's what it feels like.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.162
- You're fucking crazy.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.397
You're fucking insane.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.769
Sarah, Sarah,
please listen to me.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.705
I can access Kenneth's
bank account.

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:25.875
I can access his account.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.616
I can access his account.

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:36.052
Okay?

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:39.823
Sarah, please. Please,
please, please.

01:11:01.157 --> 01:11:02.926
- Mummy, look!

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:03.993
- Hey rabbit!

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:08.064
Oh, it's magnificent.

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:11.668
- An owl gave it to me.
- Did he?

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:12.502
Come here.

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:16.172
Hey you.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.741
- I found
it in the garden.

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:18.908
- Oh, did you?

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:23.279
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, is it tickly?

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.113
- Yeah!

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:27.917
- How'd you go?
- Yeah, great.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.185
We had a really good weekend,

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.254
didn't we? - Good.

01:11:31.254 --> 01:11:33.590
- We played all weekend,
and we collected the eggs.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.224
- Did you collect eggs?

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:36.793
Were you good for Dadda?

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:37.861
- Yes.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:03.319
- The sounds of birds
chirping made them smile.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.289
Deer walked off with
Tiger by her side.

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:08.257
They didn't say anything.

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:11.227
The setting sun
warmed their faces.

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:13.963
The wind rustled their fur.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.264
It was time for quiet.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.536
And anyway, they knew what
the other was thinking.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:22.338
- The end!
