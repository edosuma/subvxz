00:01.262 --> 00:03.238
<i>Previously on</i>
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.477 --> 00:05.579
For us making it to senior year.

00:05.614 --> 00:07.248
Not all of us made it.

00:07.282 --> 00:08.582
Can you see, or not?
No.

00:08.617 --> 00:11.485
The surgery didn't--
No, it didn't.

00:11.519 --> 00:13.587
Garrett Reynolds, you're under arrest.
For what?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.489
The murder of
Alison Dilaurentis.

00:15.523 --> 00:17.591
Is miss Rivers available?
<i>How did you get my number?</i>

00:17.626 --> 00:20.194
Hey. Everything okay

00:20.228 --> 00:23.230
I need a lawyer, and your mom's
one of the best in the state.

00:23.265 --> 00:24.431
I'm not going to help you.

00:24.466 --> 00:27.401
I think I remember
leaving your house,

00:27.435 --> 00:29.536
and the next thing I know,
I'm here.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.605
You guys, this is a set-up.
It's not "A."

00:31.640 --> 00:34.675
Mona is drooling in her bed
at a nut hospital.

00:34.709 --> 00:36.243
We don't know that for sure.

00:36.278 --> 00:37.578
- I've been visiting her.
- What?!

00:37.612 --> 00:40.514
"Mona played with dolls--
I play with body parts."

00:40.548 --> 00:42.283
"Game on, bitches."

00:42.317 --> 00:43.550
"A."

00:47.389 --> 00:51.225
The author goes to great
lengths to establish Hedda Gabler

00:51.259 --> 00:52.726
as a strong, proud woman,

00:52.761 --> 00:56.730
someone who could never live with
the threat of being blackmailed.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.634
But Hedda was pushed
to take a desperate action.

01:00.669 --> 01:03.404
And while she may have
seen it as brave,

01:03.438 --> 01:05.406
we see it as tragic.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.441
What might really be tragic

01:07.475 --> 01:10.444
is if some of you
don't start taking some notes.

01:10.478 --> 01:13.514
Sorry. Senior year is not
all about skipping classes

01:13.548 --> 01:16.350
and dancing for the security
cameras at Walmart.

01:16.384 --> 01:18.585
That's what
your weekends are for.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.557
You might also want to research
some of his other plays

01:23.591 --> 01:26.493
and see how they were
received at that time...

01:29.297 --> 01:32.232
Emily, is everything all right?

01:32.267 --> 01:33.600
C-can I be excused?

01:41.276 --> 01:42.476
Emily--

01:42.510 --> 01:45.346
What's going on?
No, no. Just come on.

01:46.581 --> 01:49.283
Em, what's the matter?
Talk to us.

01:51.619 --> 01:53.420
What is that?

01:53.455 --> 01:55.689
Are those <i>teeth?</i>

01:55.724 --> 01:58.292
Please just get rid of it.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.327
Are they Alison's?
My God, I can't breathe.

02:00.362 --> 02:01.562
It wasn't enough
to steal her bones,

02:01.596 --> 02:04.231
now we're gonna get
pieces of her delivered to us?

02:04.265 --> 02:06.500
Guys, there probably aren't even human.
They're totally human!

02:06.534 --> 02:09.235
How do you know? Because I
worked at a dentist's office.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.272
For two days, answering phones. Yeah,
and there were teeth everywhere.

02:12.307 --> 02:15.642
Even the friggin' bathroom key
was shaped like a cuspid.

02:22.550 --> 02:25.419
Guys, real or not, this "A" is
working overtime to frame us.

02:25.453 --> 02:27.488
First the call to Emily
from Spencer's phone,

02:27.522 --> 02:30.257
then the cemetery photo, and now--
It's all my fault.

02:30.291 --> 02:33.193
Em, stop. No. That whole
night is like a black hole.

02:33.228 --> 02:35.229
I still can't figure out
how I got to Ali's grave.

02:35.263 --> 02:37.264
We need to give this
to the police.

02:37.298 --> 02:39.666
We can't. We already lied
to them about the lake house.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.201
Yeah. That was
a huge mistake.

02:41.236 --> 02:43.237
We keep digging ourselves
in deeper.

02:43.271 --> 02:45.272
Burning those photos
was one thing--

02:45.306 --> 02:47.241
These are teeth. Okay?

02:47.275 --> 02:49.376
We should at least tell our parents.
Tell them what?

02:49.411 --> 02:51.378
We have no idea
what this "A" knows.

02:51.413 --> 02:54.581
Are you ready to explain every lie
we've ever told since Ali died?

02:54.616 --> 02:56.316
You don't have to
protect me, okay?

02:56.351 --> 02:57.584
I can take the blame
for all of this.

02:57.619 --> 02:59.219
Emily, stop.

02:59.254 --> 03:00.554
You're not in this by yourself.

03:00.588 --> 03:02.222
But if you could
remember something else

03:02.257 --> 03:04.358
from that black hole
besides an old car,

03:04.392 --> 03:06.160
that'd be nice.
Hanna.

03:06.194 --> 03:07.561
I'm just saying,
it'd be helpful.

03:07.595 --> 03:09.363
Can we please
just get rid of that?

03:09.397 --> 03:11.231
We can't toss this.
This is evidence.

03:11.266 --> 03:13.333
I'll put it in my locker
until we figure out what to do.

03:13.368 --> 03:15.335
Like your locker
is safe from "A"?

03:15.370 --> 03:16.637
Just give it to me.
I'll put it in my purse--

03:19.207 --> 03:20.507
Hanna.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.242
I will get it.
No, wait!

03:22.277 --> 03:24.244
You can't just dive in there.
These things have sensors.

03:24.279 --> 03:26.280
Excuse me? You just have
to be really careful.

03:26.314 --> 03:28.415
Well, if <i>you would like to. No.</i>

I can't believe we've lost it.

It wasn't like we were
gonna hand it over to the cops.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.355
I wanted to. We could have
found out who sent it to us.

04:08.389 --> 04:11.225
There were fingerprints on that necklace.
Yeah, mine.

04:11.259 --> 04:13.393
Hanna, you have to go back to Radley. 
What?

04:13.428 --> 04:15.529
You need to make Mona talk.
Spencer's right.

04:15.563 --> 04:17.297
Mona has never
been working alone,

04:17.332 --> 04:19.266
and she's probably still
giving people orders.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.500
Find out who else has seen her.

04:20.535 --> 04:23.270
You guys just ripped me a new
one last week for visiting her.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.472
Now you want me to
go back there with cupcakes?

04:25.507 --> 04:28.442
If we want answers,
focusing on Garrett.

04:28.476 --> 04:32.279
I will go back to Garrett,
if you will work on Mona.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.581
Will you go today?
After school?

04:49.397 --> 04:52.499
Has anyone spoken to her
since school started?

04:52.534 --> 04:56.436
No. I still think
it's really shady

04:56.471 --> 05:00.374
that she didn't get back from Music Camp
until the first day of school.

05:00.408 --> 05:03.310
It's no shadier than Lucas
strolling around

05:03.344 --> 05:05.245
on Saturday
at four in the morning.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.247
Well, maybe that's
their witching house.

05:07.282 --> 05:09.349
So now we think
they're definitely connected?

05:09.384 --> 05:11.418
Jenna <i>and</i> Lucas?

05:11.452 --> 05:15.155
Em, you saw them talking to that <i>Black Swan person</i>
at the masquerade party.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.524
Mona could have an entire
outfield playing for her.

05:17.559 --> 05:19.560
Hey, watch it.

05:19.594 --> 05:23.230
Here you go, man. That's okay,
Jenna, don't worry about it.

05:23.264 --> 05:26.567
Is it just me or is she blinder
than she was last year?

05:31.172 --> 05:33.140
Hey. Still working on this?

05:33.174 --> 05:35.409
Yeah, but I can fix it.

05:35.443 --> 05:37.544
The school should be paying you.
A lot.

05:40.248 --> 05:42.583
What's up?
You okay?

05:42.617 --> 05:45.485
Um, I do have to
meet my mom after school.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.522
She wants me to help
pick out an outfit

05:48.556 --> 05:50.624
for this bank thingie,

05:50.658 --> 05:53.460
so can we do dinner
tomorrow night instead?

05:55.597 --> 05:58.332
Yeah.
Tomorrow night's fine.

05:58.366 --> 06:00.534
Great. Well,
see you later, sweetie.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.274
Your mom thinks
I'm a basket case.

06:07.308 --> 06:08.542
My mom loves you, em.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.377
She knows everything
that you've been through.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.113
Can she spread the love
around the faculty lounge?

06:13.147 --> 06:14.448
I have to take
four make-up exams

06:14.482 --> 06:16.450
or they're gonna make me
repeat eleventh grade.

06:16.484 --> 06:18.218
They can't hold you back.
Yes, they can.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.486
I was absent all of April.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.154
You're gonna get through this.

06:21.189 --> 06:22.222
Maybe.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.524
You just need
a study partner. A tutor.

06:24.559 --> 06:28.295
Wait!
Why don't you just call Ezra?

06:28.329 --> 06:31.198
If your first make-up test is an
English he could be your tutor.

06:31.232 --> 06:33.567
awkward.
No, it's not.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.270
Aria, I can't think of him
as "Mr. Fitz" anymore.

06:36.304 --> 06:37.638
Okay? I've seen
his underwear drawer.

06:37.672 --> 06:40.307
Those were his socks. Why would his
socks have a flap in the middle?

06:40.341 --> 06:42.142
I'm texting you his number.
Aria, I don't--

06:42.176 --> 06:44.378
He's not teaching right now,
and it's killing him.

06:44.412 --> 06:47.180
You'd be helping
each other out.

06:49.317 --> 06:52.386
Who is that?

06:55.390 --> 06:57.357
Meredith.

06:57.392 --> 07:00.193
Wait. That's
your <i>dad</i>'s Meredith?

07:00.228 --> 07:03.330
That's the skank you and Ali
caught lip-locking in the car?

07:03.364 --> 07:06.199
If my mom sees her here...
What's she doing here?

07:08.536 --> 07:09.569
Excuse me.

07:09.604 --> 07:12.172
Are you looking for someone?

07:12.206 --> 07:15.242
Hello, Aria. I forgot
you were still a student here.

07:15.276 --> 07:17.344
Yeah, I am.
What are you doing here?

07:17.378 --> 07:20.514
I'm applying for
an open teaching position.

07:20.548 --> 07:23.517
Oh, don't worry, hon. I won't
put you down as a reference.

07:29.424 --> 07:31.158
<i>I don't get it.</i>

07:31.192 --> 07:33.160
Why would she want
to work at a school

07:33.194 --> 07:35.462
where she's gonna bump into
my mother every single day?

07:35.496 --> 07:37.564
And why should my mom
have to go through this?

07:37.598 --> 07:39.533
She's been divorced
for, like, 20 minutes.

07:39.567 --> 07:42.502
Aria, <i>breathe. Meredith
applied for the job,</i>

07:42.537 --> 07:44.471
it doesn't mean she got it.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.406
There's no reason
to tell your mom.

07:46.441 --> 07:50.110
Seriously, though, who is giving
<i>that</i> woman a reference--my dad?

07:50.144 --> 07:51.511
Ooh, yeah, I wouldn't
tell him either.

07:51.546 --> 07:53.513
Why? You think he has
something to do with this?

07:53.548 --> 07:55.415
I didn't say that,
I just think you're still

07:55.450 --> 07:57.384
walking on bit of scorched
earth when it comes to us,

07:57.418 --> 07:59.486
and if you put him on the defensive--
He's not in that place anymore.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.189
Then why am I dropping you off
three blocks from your house?

08:02.223 --> 08:04.358
Because he's still
in that place.

08:04.392 --> 08:07.361
I hate this. I hate
having to sneak around

08:07.395 --> 08:10.063
and avoid saying your name...

08:10.098 --> 08:13.100
It's like
we're going backwards.

08:13.134 --> 08:15.068
One battle at a time.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.504
We just had a nice dinner--
with your mom.

08:17.538 --> 08:21.341
Okay? Let's celebrate
what <i>is</i> working.

08:25.146 --> 08:27.547
It's Emily. Has she
called you yet? No.

08:27.582 --> 08:30.183
Why haven't you
called Ezra yet?

08:30.218 --> 08:32.385
Call him now.
He's free.

08:32.419 --> 08:34.554
Emily's gonna be calling you.
I might not answer.

08:34.589 --> 08:37.224
Ezra, she's sinking.

08:37.258 --> 08:38.357
Please?

08:54.575 --> 08:57.344
So, um...

08:57.378 --> 09:00.580
Did you talk to your mom?

09:00.615 --> 09:04.384
No. I need you to give me
a better reason.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.319
Other than being innocent?

09:06.354 --> 09:09.089
Look, you said you knew
who dug up Ali's grave.

09:09.123 --> 09:11.525
How do I know that the person
didn't just do that for you?

09:11.559 --> 09:14.461
I didn't touch your friend Maya,
and I didn't kill Alison,

09:14.495 --> 09:17.464
and guess what, what was snatched
from her grave that night

09:17.498 --> 09:20.267
would have actually proved it.
How?

09:20.301 --> 09:22.436
Is your mom
defending me or not?

09:22.470 --> 09:27.274
Why would she or anyone else in this
town believe that you're innocent?

09:27.308 --> 09:32.412
Spencer, somebody you know well
has you completely fooled.

09:32.447 --> 09:38.185
People lie, but...
Medical records don't.

09:38.219 --> 09:41.221
Whose medical records?

09:41.255 --> 09:43.490
Who are you talking about?
Alison?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.462
Jenna's?

09:48.496 --> 09:50.497
Wait.

09:50.531 --> 09:53.200
Are you talking about Jenna?

09:59.834 --> 10:02.534
So it turns out ***

10:02.698 --> 10:04.594
that frizzy-haired girl
who dates the quarterback.

10:04.714 --> 10:07.279
You know, the one
who transferred from Ohio?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.443
Well, Noel Kahn thinks
this dude is a genius

10:10.477 --> 10:13.579
because he can burp
<i>the star-spangled banner.</i>

10:19.553 --> 10:22.388
Have you...
Heard from Noel?

10:24.558 --> 10:26.692
Does he ever come visit you?

10:34.234 --> 10:38.304
Has anyone... Been to
visit you besides me?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.512
You know what, Mona?
If I told the police

10:46.546 --> 10:48.547
that you mowed me down
with your car,

10:48.582 --> 10:52.451
you would not be here getting a slice of
peach pie every day to wash down your meds.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.454
You'd be sharing a jail cell with
someone calling <i>you</i> "Peach Pie"

10:55.489 --> 10:57.423
while you braid her back hair!

10:58.558 --> 11:00.393
God, Mona, you owe me!

11:00.427 --> 11:03.596
All right? You have made my
life a nightmare! You owe me!

11:07.334 --> 11:09.602
What's going on?

11:09.636 --> 11:13.239
This visit's over.
<i>Now.</i>

11:30.323 --> 11:31.490
Hey there.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.625
Hi.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.528
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.197
No, I'm okay.
Thanks, Mr. Fitz.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.366
You can call me Ezra.
No, I can't.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.436
But I can try.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.306
Have a seat.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.679
So...Aria mentioned

11:53.714 --> 11:57.349
you're taking the English
make-up exam this Thursday.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.253
Yeah, and then chem and history
next week, and Spanish after that.

12:01.288 --> 12:06.225
Great. Well, I'm glad we can start
with a language I actually speak...in.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.361
But not always so well.
Did you like the novel?

12:09.396 --> 12:13.232
Yeah, it was okay.
Ending was kind of sad.

12:15.302 --> 12:19.238
Emily, um...

12:19.272 --> 12:22.274
I'm so sorry about Maya.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.477
We don't have to
talk about that.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.245
No. I know.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.381
But it's just, I--
I wanted you to know that.

12:31.485 --> 12:34.487
I'm just...Sorry.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.639
Your friend Mona deserves
to be drawn and quartered.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.675
And given what she's done, I
understand you want to punish her.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.645
That's not why I came here.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.181
I just lost it.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.415
I've done worse.

13:05.652 --> 13:09.321
I once threw a bowl of soup
across the room

13:09.356 --> 13:10.623
when visiting my dad.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.192
In a place much like this.
Worse.

13:13.226 --> 13:17.296
Your dad was in the nut house?
For years.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.532
He checked out of my life
when I was ten,

13:19.566 --> 13:23.202
traded our family room
for the chaos inside his head.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.572
He made your friend down the
hall seem downright chatty.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.407
She won't even apologize.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.643
Then you have to
accept that, Hanna.

13:30.677 --> 13:34.547
You've lost someone
whom you trusted.

13:34.581 --> 13:39.351
And then you might be grieving for the Mona you
<i>didn't</i> know as much as for the one you did.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.455
I'm getting really tired
of losing people.

13:43.490 --> 13:47.259
And this is particularly hard because
Mona's right in front of you.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.662
In clinical terms,
we call it "ambiguous loss."

13:49.696 --> 13:53.666
What? There's been a death, but
it doesn't involve a body.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.602
Like when a soldier
goes missing,

13:56.636 --> 14:00.439
or a relative
slips into dementia.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.609
They're gone,
but yet, still here.

14:10.584 --> 14:12.418
Here.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.601
Where did Jenna go
when music camp ended?

14:28.635 --> 14:31.203
Did your parents pick her up?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.172
I have no idea. Why?

14:33.206 --> 14:36.242
Well, that camp ended
on August 23rd.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.344
I looked it up online.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.180
Did she just stay up
in the Poconos?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.415
Honestly, I don't know.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.419
I was packing up my stuff
before she even went to camp.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.656
Just eating breakfast there was weird.
How come?

14:50.690 --> 14:53.559
My parents were treating Jenna
like one of her snow-globes.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.461
After the surgery didn't work,

14:55.495 --> 14:58.631
it was like they thought she'd crack
if they asked the wrong question.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.338
Hey.
Hmm?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.374
Come here.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.516
You're a little tense.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.452
Yeah.
I was born that way.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.655
Maybe I can help.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.428
<i>♪ ...just a lie</i>

15:29.462 --> 15:33.365
<i>♪ but I found you out</i>

15:33.400 --> 15:37.403
<i>♪ and said my last goodbye</i>

15:37.437 --> 15:41.473
<i>♪ so what happened to you,</i>
<i>darling.... ♪</i>

15:46.313 --> 15:48.247
Spencer?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.549
Yeah! In here!

15:51.584 --> 15:53.352
Oh.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.220
Hello, Toby.
Hey, Mrs. Hastings,

15:55.255 --> 15:59.491
how's it goin'?
I've had better days.

15:59.526 --> 16:03.162
Did your sister call? I've left
three messages for her.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.164
Uh, no, is Melissa okay?

16:05.198 --> 16:10.135
I don't think "okay" really applies
in her situation, does it?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.137
Will you be joining us
for dinner, Toby?

16:12.172 --> 16:15.307
Uh...Well, I was--

16:15.342 --> 16:17.209
Sure.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.613
<i>It was weird,</i>
<i>but we got past it.</i>

16:21.648 --> 16:24.350
So you're calling him "Ezra,"
or "Mr. Fitz"?

16:24.384 --> 16:26.518
Neither. It's a lot easier
not to call him anything.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.487
Oh. That's what your
dad does, right, Aria?

16:28.521 --> 16:32.324
Just about. This whole "don't ask,
don't tell" thing is not working.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.360
I did that with my mom forever.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.328
But she finally came around.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.163
By the time
I brought Tamara over,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.299
they were bonding
over arts and crafts.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.669
I don't think my dad is gonna be
scrapbookin' with Ezra anytime soon.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.339
What's that?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.517
Is that yours?

17:01.254 --> 17:03.188
What's going on?
Whose is that?

17:05.191 --> 17:08.227
Do you want to save your
parents' marriage, or not?

17:08.261 --> 17:10.128
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.598
If my dad said that Meredith's
history, I believe him.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.402
Oh, grow up. They probably
do it on that couch. Daily.

17:17.537 --> 17:21.272
Do you smell cheap perfume?

17:21.307 --> 17:24.209
Ali, there <i>are other students
that come in here, okay?</i>

17:24.243 --> 17:25.544
Yeah,
and how many of them

17:25.578 --> 17:28.146
like to roll around
and sweat on his couch?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.284
Is that someone coming?

17:39.192 --> 17:42.428
Which student
does this belong to?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.365
You found that in his couch?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.333
Honey, I'm sure she's shed
a lot more than that.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.370
Probably find her panties
in the mini-fridge.

17:56.342 --> 18:00.512
Oh. So they have been
spending quality time together.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.183
I hear break-up sex
is the best.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.519
Why would he lie? He told
me that he ended it.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.190
Maybe he did, sweetie.
But people make up.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.292
They backslide.

18:15.295 --> 18:19.331
Aria, if you really want
to get rid of this bitch,

18:19.365 --> 18:22.501
you're gonna have to help daddy
figure out what she really is--

18:22.535 --> 18:27.473
a vindictive,
homewrecking bunny-boiler.

18:27.507 --> 18:32.344
Don't look now, but mere-death
is having a meltdown.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.237
How come you never told us about that?
Why would I?

18:58.271 --> 19:01.273
I felt like complete crap
by the time I got home,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.408
and I made Alison promise
to never tell a soul.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.512
So why is it in your locker? You've
been hiding it this whole time?

19:06.546 --> 19:10.382
No. No. It's just that
you guys...

19:10.416 --> 19:14.353
Don't you remember when Ali's mom
called us before her funeral

19:14.387 --> 19:19.158
and she asked all of us if we
each wanted to put something....

19:19.192 --> 19:20.526
A keepsake in her casket?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.561
And that's what
you put in there?

19:25.431 --> 19:29.434
So real teeth or not, that was
<i>definitely</i> stolen from Ali's grave.

19:37.363 --> 19:41.080
So next, cite an example of
how the author uses symbolism.

19:42.544 --> 19:44.257
Emily?

19:46.275 --> 19:47.609
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

19:47.643 --> 19:50.345
Wharton's use of symbolism?

19:52.581 --> 19:54.382
The cat.

19:54.416 --> 19:56.417
The broken dish.

19:59.522 --> 20:01.456
Emily...

20:01.490 --> 20:03.391
You know this material,

20:03.425 --> 20:06.327
and you've been in
high-pressure situations before.

20:06.362 --> 20:08.630
When you were swimming,
you thrived on them, right?

20:08.664 --> 20:11.432
So how did you
prepare for a race?

20:11.467 --> 20:15.403
What did you do minutes
before you jumped in that pool?

20:15.437 --> 20:18.540
Um, I...
Listened to music.

20:18.574 --> 20:21.676
Then that's what you'll do
before you take these exams.

20:21.710 --> 20:25.680
Everything you need to know
is already in your head.

20:38.427 --> 20:40.662
Aria? Is that you?

20:42.498 --> 20:43.665
Jenna.

20:43.699 --> 20:46.601
I thought I recognized
the ringtone.

20:46.635 --> 20:49.404
I was going to
call you tonight.

20:49.438 --> 20:52.240
Why?

20:52.274 --> 20:54.475
I lost my accompanist
for next week's assembly,

20:54.510 --> 20:58.279
and I thought of asking <i>you</i>
to play with me.

20:59.381 --> 21:01.449
Oh. Uh...

21:01.483 --> 21:03.351
I'm a little rusty.

21:03.385 --> 21:05.220
Oh, it's an easy piece.

21:05.254 --> 21:09.524
Just a couple of rehearsals
and we'd be good to go.

21:09.558 --> 21:11.426
So you want to come over
tomorrow?

21:11.460 --> 21:13.528
Gee, uh--uh--

21:13.562 --> 21:15.430
I'd really love to, Jenna,

21:15.464 --> 21:19.500
but I'm helping my dad with
this project he's doing, and--

21:19.568 --> 21:23.371
He's actually waving at me from across
the street, so I really gotta go.

21:33.415 --> 21:37.151
<i>She invited
you to that house?</i>

21:37.186 --> 21:41.522
- What'd you say?
<i>- I said no freakin' way. To myself.</i>

21:41.557 --> 21:44.292
But to her I just said
that I was busy.

21:44.326 --> 21:48.162
Did you ever find a note? Are we
sure that earring came from "A"?

21:48.197 --> 21:50.198
<i>I'd be a lot more sure</i>

21:50.232 --> 21:52.233
if you could squeeze
something out of Mona.

21:52.268 --> 21:54.535
<i>Please tell me that</i>
<i>you're going back there.</i>

21:54.570 --> 21:57.372
<i>Are you? Uh, I don't know.
I'll call you back.</i>

21:58.540 --> 22:00.541
Hey. Took long enough.

22:00.576 --> 22:03.478
They messed up. Gave our
order to someone else.

22:03.512 --> 22:05.380
Didn't you get my text?

22:05.414 --> 22:08.549
Uh, no. I was
on the phone with Aria.

22:08.584 --> 22:11.386
I'm starving.
Me too.

22:16.258 --> 22:18.559
You got somewhere else
you need to be?

22:18.594 --> 22:20.395
No. No.

22:20.429 --> 22:22.297
Of course not.

22:27.569 --> 22:30.338
Ask whoever that is
to call you back, please.

22:30.372 --> 22:32.540
I-- I won't
answer it.

22:32.574 --> 22:35.410
Everything okay?

22:35.444 --> 22:41.249
No. Clearly it's not if my daughter's
making secret trips to the county jail.

22:44.219 --> 22:47.188
There's still a lot of things
that I don't understand.

22:47.222 --> 22:49.190
Yeah, me too, like why would
you have anything to do with

22:49.224 --> 22:51.326
a man who's accused of murdering
two teenage girls?

22:51.360 --> 22:53.161
Mom, Emily is really hurting,

22:53.195 --> 22:55.263
and I just wanted some answers.

22:55.297 --> 22:57.332
Did this happen to Maya
because she knew too much?

22:57.366 --> 22:59.600
Did the D.A.'s office send you
there to ask that question?

23:01.537 --> 23:03.237
I didn't think so.

23:03.272 --> 23:06.240
I'm guessing it'll be
answered at his trial.

23:06.275 --> 23:10.111
Why are you talking to me like I'm a hostile witness?
Maya was my friend, too.

23:10.145 --> 23:12.480
This is a dangerous man,
Spencer.

23:12.514 --> 23:16.484
He wouldn't be locked up if there
weren't damaging evidence against him.

23:16.518 --> 23:19.320
Don't you ever go there again.

23:19.355 --> 23:23.291
So is rosewood safe now that one
dangerous man is locked up?

23:23.325 --> 23:25.526
Because garret was already in
jail when Ali's grave was dug up.

23:25.561 --> 23:28.429
If you're implying that he's got
helpful friends on the outside,

23:28.464 --> 23:30.498
that's even more of
a reason not to see him.

23:30.532 --> 23:32.567
People might think that's you.

23:32.601 --> 23:35.536
Don't you <i>ever</i> go there again.

23:35.571 --> 23:37.238
Am I clear?

23:45.481 --> 23:49.183
I thought you were starved.

23:49.218 --> 23:50.551
Guess I'm not.

23:52.388 --> 23:56.290
Okay, where do you
need to be right now?

23:56.325 --> 23:59.160
Hanna, we stopped lying to
each other a long time ago,

23:59.194 --> 24:01.229
didn't we?

24:02.431 --> 24:06.200
I was thinking of
visiting Mona at Radley.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.241
Why now?
Just curious.

24:13.275 --> 24:15.476
It's complicated.

24:15.511 --> 24:18.546
No, it's more than complicated.
It is completely whacked.

24:18.580 --> 24:20.581
Look, she was my best friend
in tenth grade. Yeah,

24:20.616 --> 24:23.317
and she threw you a few
poisoned apples in the eleventh.

24:23.352 --> 24:26.487
I don't expect you to understand, all right?
I know you hate her.

24:26.522 --> 24:29.390
I feel sorry for her, okay? But not
enough to send her a get well card.

24:29.425 --> 24:32.126
- Caleb-- - I don't care if she spends the
rest of her life in a paper gown

24:32.161 --> 24:35.196
making ash trays and pooping
in a stall without a door

24:35.230 --> 24:38.199
as long as she can't get
anywhere near you, or hurt you--

24:38.233 --> 24:41.269
It <i>hurt</i> me to
see her like this, okay?

24:41.303 --> 24:43.404
I'm having an ambiguous loss.

24:43.439 --> 24:45.473
You're what?

24:45.507 --> 24:48.342
That's what it's called. Someone
dies but they're still here.

24:48.377 --> 24:50.478
Where did you pick that up?

24:50.512 --> 24:53.281
I googled it, okay?

24:54.349 --> 24:56.484
I'm not gonna have this fight.

25:02.224 --> 25:05.526
Fine.
I'll go with you.

25:05.561 --> 25:08.129
What?
To Radley.

25:08.163 --> 25:10.064
I'll drive you there.

25:10.099 --> 25:13.101
By the time we get there
visiting hours will be over.

25:13.135 --> 25:15.436
Then we'll go tomorrow.

25:18.507 --> 25:21.309
Why would you do that?

25:21.343 --> 25:23.511
Because I love you.

25:23.545 --> 25:27.548
And I don't want us
sneaking around each other.

26:17.477 --> 26:20.510
Dad?

26:22.930 --> 26:24.135
Can I talk to you?

26:24.255 --> 26:25.832
Yeah. What's wrong?

26:27.935 --> 26:30.937
Will you sit down? I--
I need to tell you something.

26:38.835 --> 26:40.409
Um...

26:41.059 --> 26:45.718
I know that your office was
trashed a couple years ago.

26:47.888 --> 26:50.723
And I know that
I'm not supposed to know that

26:50.758 --> 26:53.526
because you thought that
it was Meredith who did it.

26:58.966 --> 27:01.935
But it wasn't her, it was me.

27:06.016 --> 27:08.908
Why are you
telling me this now?

27:11.679 --> 27:15.481
Did seeing Meredith yesterday
bring this on?

27:17.651 --> 27:21.454
I guess. Maybe.

27:21.488 --> 27:24.891
Do you have any idea how close
I came to calling the police?

27:24.925 --> 27:28.561
I thought she wanted to hurt my family.
She already <i>had.</i>

27:30.965 --> 27:32.932
So I did it.

27:32.967 --> 27:36.769
I said a lot of harsh things
to her at the time.

27:36.804 --> 27:41.674
And now you're telling me that I
accused her of something that...

27:41.709 --> 27:43.643
You did.

27:59.727 --> 28:01.628
We both owe her an apology.

28:01.662 --> 28:03.896
And I'm not doing that for you.

28:11.505 --> 28:14.841
<i>♪ ...yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

28:14.875 --> 28:19.779
<i>♪ jump in,</i>
<i>floating like a feather-- ♪</i>

28:21.582 --> 28:23.483
You ready?

28:25.586 --> 28:28.521
Okay, guys, you have 45 minutes.

28:28.555 --> 28:31.624
I'll give you a five-minute warning
before I collect the tests.

28:31.659 --> 28:32.759
Good luck.

28:48.809 --> 28:52.945
So...
This won't be long.

28:52.980 --> 28:56.516
If you need me,
I'll be right here, okay?

29:08.829 --> 29:10.797
Hey, Mona.

29:13.734 --> 29:15.501
I'm back.

29:20.574 --> 29:23.743
I didn't come here
to throw any more chairs.

29:23.777 --> 29:26.646
I just...

29:26.680 --> 29:28.848
Wanted to return the favor.

29:38.892 --> 29:41.594
I brought the good stuff.

29:41.628 --> 29:44.497
<i>How did you</i>
<i>get your hands on these?</i>

29:44.531 --> 29:47.734
Nobody was home. I found them
in Jenna's bathroom.

29:47.768 --> 29:50.603
So what are they?
They're eye drops?

29:50.637 --> 29:52.839
The doctor prescribed
the first bottle to Jenna

29:52.873 --> 29:55.908
last spring after the surgery.
So?

29:56.944 --> 29:58.745
Thank you.
Thanks.

29:58.779 --> 29:59.879
You're welcome.

30:03.784 --> 30:06.819
Check out the expiration date
on the other bottle.

30:06.854 --> 30:12.525
If the surgery didn't work, why is she
still renewing that prescription?

30:12.559 --> 30:15.862
Wait. What are you saying?
You think Jenna can <i>see?</i>

30:47.928 --> 30:49.762
Emily?

30:49.797 --> 30:50.963
Are you okay?

30:57.805 --> 30:59.739
Five minutes, guys.

31:17.691 --> 31:19.992
Okay, time is up.

31:26.934 --> 31:29.969
Emily...
It's not a take-home test.

31:30.003 --> 31:32.605
Oh, right.
Sorry.

31:32.639 --> 31:35.808
Did you need more time?
No, I'm done.

31:35.843 --> 31:37.510
Emily, wait.

31:37.544 --> 31:38.978
Did you study for this?

31:39.012 --> 31:40.913
Yeah, I did. But I--

31:40.948 --> 31:43.583
I did the best I could.
I really have to go.

32:00.033 --> 32:01.667
Hello.

32:03.503 --> 32:04.737
Hi.

32:04.771 --> 32:06.672
Do you want to sit?

32:09.810 --> 32:12.845
I'd...really rather not
do this here, if that's okay.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.481
Well, here is where we are.

32:15.515 --> 32:16.616
Sit.

32:23.590 --> 32:26.726
Look, I-- I know that
this is ancient history,

32:26.760 --> 32:30.830
but I just needed
to clarify something.

32:30.864 --> 32:36.569
After I found out about you and
my dad, I was really upset.

32:36.603 --> 32:38.638
And I broke into his office--

32:38.672 --> 32:40.806
You don't have to recount
all the gory details.

32:40.841 --> 32:44.677
I spoke to your father
this morning.

32:44.711 --> 32:48.948
I remember his threats on my
voicemail like it was yesterday.

32:48.982 --> 32:50.983
Right.

32:54.855 --> 32:56.722
Well, I'm sorry.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.724
Thank you.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.828
Maybe I'll hear that from
your father tomorrow, too.

33:02.863 --> 33:05.932
You're seeing him?
We made lunch plans.

33:05.966 --> 33:08.935
And I guess I have you
to thank for that.

33:12.506 --> 33:15.775
Is there something else
you want to say?

33:15.809 --> 33:17.543
Yeah.

33:19.646 --> 33:23.616
I didn't go to his office with the
intention of stealing anything,

33:23.650 --> 33:26.719
I just took the earrings because--
Wait.

33:26.753 --> 33:29.021
Go back. Earrings?

33:32.960 --> 33:37.530
I don't have the other one, but as soon as
I find it I'll make sure that you get it.

33:41.668 --> 33:44.637
What made you think
this belonged to me?

33:44.671 --> 33:46.772
That's not my earring.

34:00.831 --> 34:01.965
Can I help you?

34:01.999 --> 34:04.834
Yeah, I'm just here
to visit Garrett Reynolds.

34:04.868 --> 34:07.804
He's meeting with his lawyer.
It could be a while.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.081
Oh. May I wait?

34:09.369 --> 34:11.808
Suit yourself.
Thank you.

34:27.925 --> 34:31.828
Can you give me a list of all
previous visitors, please?

34:34.130 --> 34:36.766
Thanks.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.937
No, no, no. I want something
compiled for the last five months.

34:40.971 --> 34:44.907
I'll need a little
time to put that together.

34:44.942 --> 34:46.976
Okay. Tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow works.

34:47.011 --> 34:49.012
Okay, thanks.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.068
Pardon me.
You're with Hanna?

35:13.871 --> 35:16.873
I'm Dr. Kingston.
Hanna knows me as wren.

35:16.907 --> 35:19.709
And you are?

35:19.743 --> 35:20.977
Caleb.

35:21.011 --> 35:22.745
Her boyfriend.

35:22.780 --> 35:26.716
Very good. So you decided
to join her this time.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.084
Yeah.

35:28.118 --> 35:30.687
Yeah, Hanna pretty much does
whatever she wants,

35:30.721 --> 35:32.855
so I figured
I would get onboard.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.724
Indeed. Well,
from what I've gathered,

35:34.758 --> 35:36.959
coming here has been a great
source of conflict for her.

35:36.994 --> 35:39.729
She's spoken to you about this?

35:39.763 --> 35:42.699
She has. We talked about
patience and compassion.

35:42.733 --> 35:45.068
It seems like the other day was a
bit of a turning point for her.

35:45.102 --> 35:47.070
She's just starting to
come to terms with

35:47.104 --> 35:50.139
all the anger that's tied
to ambiguous loss.

35:54.912 --> 35:56.779
Well, then, best press on.

35:56.814 --> 35:59.749
But please give Hanna
my best. Nice meeting you.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.751
Yeah. Same here.

36:18.035 --> 36:20.636
What was my mother doing here?

36:21.839 --> 36:23.773
Sorry. I can't talk.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.908
My new attorney
made me promise.

36:25.943 --> 36:28.778
What-- what are you saying?

36:28.812 --> 36:30.713
Is my mother your lawyer now?

36:32.683 --> 36:34.917
No. There's--
there's no way--

36:34.952 --> 36:37.720
I never even asked her
to help you.

36:37.755 --> 36:40.757
I couldn't, she still
thinks you're guilty.

36:40.791 --> 36:42.024
What did you say that
made her change her mind?

36:42.059 --> 36:43.893
I gotta go.
Wait.

36:43.927 --> 36:46.796
- What about Jenna, though?
Could you at least tell me-- - I'm done.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.592
Okay,
so the lighting in here sucks.

37:49.626 --> 37:51.928
But at least you're starting to
look like someone I recognize.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.937
Look, Mona,

38:00.971 --> 38:03.773
I didn't come here
to play beauty shop.

38:03.807 --> 38:08.811
I came here because I know there
is a person still in there.

38:08.846 --> 38:11.781
I know you've been hurt,
but so have I.

38:11.815 --> 38:13.716
And I still am.

38:18.522 --> 38:21.624
Trust me, you're not the first
person to hurt me, Mona.

38:23.527 --> 38:25.695
And you're certainly
not the last.

38:28.699 --> 38:32.568
You're getting them
again, aren't you?

38:32.603 --> 38:33.870
The texts.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.843
Hey, Hanna. The nurse said
that visiting hours are over.

38:40.878 --> 38:43.746
Um, yeah, can you, uh,
can you give me a minute?

38:43.780 --> 38:46.549
Just tell the nurse
that I have to pack up.

38:50.754 --> 38:52.555
Mona, what texts
are you talking about?

38:55.859 --> 38:58.761
What texts are you
talking about?

39:01.531 --> 39:02.732
Mona.

39:04.635 --> 39:05.935
Hanna, come on.

39:07.838 --> 39:10.606
We're not done with this.

39:10.641 --> 39:11.908
Okay? Do you hear me?

39:16.713 --> 39:18.648
I'm coming back, Mona.

39:51.613 --> 39:55.197
Sorry to disturb you.
Do you have a minute?

39:56.172 --> 39:59.539
Sure. But if
this is about Aria--

39:59.652 --> 40:02.588
It's Emily.
What about her?

40:02.622 --> 40:05.724
Well, I saw her after
the makeup exam yesterday,

40:05.758 --> 40:09.428
and she was...distraught.
She thought she did poorly.

40:09.462 --> 40:10.662
I don't know
if Aria's motioned it,

40:10.697 --> 40:12.731
but I've been helping her
prep for these exams, and--

40:12.765 --> 40:14.566
What is your question?

40:14.601 --> 40:18.370
I just wanted to know
how she did.

40:19.672 --> 40:21.773
She did...fine.

40:23.343 --> 40:26.345
There's a lot riding
on this for her.

40:26.379 --> 40:27.546
Now, maybe if she could
take it again--

40:27.580 --> 40:30.616
There's no need for her
to take it again, Ezra.

40:30.650 --> 40:34.353
I understand
what she's gone through.

40:34.387 --> 40:37.356
Emily did very well.

40:37.390 --> 40:40.492
We're all rooting
for her to succeed.

40:43.663 --> 40:44.763
Great.

40:44.797 --> 40:47.299
<i>That's all she said?</i>

40:47.333 --> 40:49.501
Isn't that enough?
No. That is <i>not</i> enough.

40:49.535 --> 40:51.637
You have to go back
to Radley, Han. Alone.

40:51.671 --> 40:54.706
It's not so easy. Caleb is all over me.
I don't need to know that.

40:54.741 --> 40:57.476
Well, Caleb's not finding
dug-up jewelry in his locker.

40:57.510 --> 41:00.545
Whose earring did Ali find in my dad's couch?
One question at a time.

41:00.580 --> 41:03.382
You're not gonna ask your mom why
she's suddenly defending Garrett?

41:03.416 --> 41:04.683
I mean, seriously, Spencer,
what is that?

41:04.717 --> 41:07.452
He probably told her
it's time to lock Jenna up.

41:07.487 --> 41:10.422
She was driving that night,
guys. I remembered. Clearly.

41:10.456 --> 41:12.424
We believe you, okay?

41:12.458 --> 41:16.361
But honestly, I don't think that you
remember anything clearly from that night.

41:16.396 --> 41:18.563
When we picked you up
you kept calling me "Arlene."

41:18.598 --> 41:21.667
Guys, she can see. She's
probably on Mona's payroll.

41:21.701 --> 41:24.536
Mona does not have any cash. They
won't even let her have floss.

41:26.439 --> 41:28.473
Okay, let's just
do this at lunch.

41:28.508 --> 41:30.409
I can't be late again.

41:31.611 --> 41:33.612
I'll be right back.

41:33.646 --> 41:36.515
I just need to rinse
my water bottle.

41:36.549 --> 41:39.318
Jenna's coming in here.
Where's the earring?

41:40.486 --> 41:42.421
What? Give me the earring.
I have an idea.

41:42.455 --> 41:44.690
What are we doing?
Do I get to slap her again?

41:44.724 --> 41:46.291
No!

41:48.461 --> 41:50.529
Okay, get in the stalls.
Go! Go!

42:47.653 --> 42:50.655
I knew it. That is it. I'm going
for <i>way</i> more than a slap.

42:50.690 --> 42:53.258
Hanna, stop.
Stop why?!

42:53.292 --> 42:56.395
Don't look at me. I'm ready to hang a sign--
"Bitch can see."

42:56.429 --> 42:58.430
She doesn't know that we know.
She will in a minute.

42:58.464 --> 43:01.266
No. We don't let her know
that we know. Not <i>yet.</i>

43:01.300 --> 43:03.335
We can <i>use</i> this...

43:03.369 --> 43:05.270
And we will.

43:18.384 --> 43:20.318
This is all we got.

43:20.353 --> 43:22.387
Season hasn't
really started yet.

43:22.422 --> 43:25.657
We usually don't get
our shipment till next month.

43:29.328 --> 43:31.463
You want all these hoodies too?

43:31.583 --> 43:32.607
You got it.

43:36.342 --> 43:37.292
So...

43:38.354 --> 43:40.304
You buy all these for a team?

43:41.085 --> 43:52.059
