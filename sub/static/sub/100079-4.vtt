00:01.960 --> 00:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">What is it?</font>

00:02.961 --> 00:05.566
A technological innovation that will
revolutionise our business.

00:05.568 --> 00:06.959
Introducing...

00:06.960 --> 00:08.959
the ice cube.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.478
<font color="#FFFF00">Sure.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, I have seen ice before.</font>

00:11.480 --> 00:12.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Like in winter, in puddles.</font>

00:12.840 --> 00:15.479
Yeah. But how about in summer
in drinks?

00:15.480 --> 00:18.319
It cools them down fast.
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm.</font>

00:18.320 --> 00:19.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Sort of bonks against your teeth,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">don't it?</font>

00:19.840 --> 00:22.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean, it is cold.</font>
Exactly.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.479
Sweaty punters will be queueing up
for these babies.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.479
I honestly think
it could be the new lemon slice.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.479
Maybe we should combine them.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.479
Have you seen the fruit bowl?
<font color="#00FFFF">Afternoon.</font>

00:31.480 --> 00:34.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh. Here it comes now,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on Grumio's head.</font>

00:34.480 --> 00:37.479
Can we have that back, please,
Grumio? Washed first, ideally.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.479
<font color="#00FFFF">No chance. Along with the bin lid,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it's a key part of my sunshade.</font>

00:40.480 --> 00:43.319
<font color="#00FFFF">That big yellow bastard's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bloody throbbing out there.</font>

00:43.320 --> 00:45.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Just wear a hat, you weirdo.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Not big enough, mate.</font>

00:45.480 --> 00:49.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I want the coverage of a parasol</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with my hands free for wafting.</font>

00:49.480 --> 00:51.679
Sounds like someone
would like an ice cube,

00:51.680 --> 00:55.479
Rome's hottest new garnish.
Or should I say coldest?

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
<font color="#FFFF00">No, you definitely shouldn't.</font>

00:56.481 --> 00:58.479
CRUNCHING
Well, don't eat it.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.519
I've only got three of those.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.679
MUSIC: When In Rome
Do As The Romans Do by Oli Julian

01:01.680 --> 01:05.480
# When in Rome, do as the Romans do

01:08.840 --> 01:10.479
# Far from home

01:10.480 --> 01:14.480
# All I got is you... #

01:16.480 --> 01:18.479
As soon as word gets out
about the ice, we'll be rammed.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.839
We'll be doing pay rises,
uniforms, the lot.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Amazing. Can't wait.</font>
Me neither.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.679
Until then, however, we're empty
so we're doing pay cuts.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.319
And shift cuts.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.479
Yours, mainly.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.519
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, look, no wozzas, boss.</font>

01:29.520 --> 01:32.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I've actually got a cheeky little</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">side hustle on the go right now</font>

01:32.480 --> 01:35.479
<font color="#00FFFF">so I'm as flush as a brush.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Side hustle? What side hustle?</font>

01:35.480 --> 01:38.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I've become a Knight of Eros</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if you must know. Nosy.</font>

01:38.480 --> 01:40.479
<font color="#FFFF00">A what? What the fuck is that?</font>

01:40.480 --> 01:44.479
<font color="#00FFFF">It's basically Rome's premier escort</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">agency for the discerning woman.</font>

01:44.480 --> 01:46.479
<font color="#FFFF00">She can't be that discerning</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if she's hiring you.</font>

01:46.480 --> 01:48.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Au contraire, mon frere.</font>

01:48.160 --> 01:52.319
<font color="#00FFFF">My penchant for neoteric verse</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">made me the ideal companion</font>

01:52.320 --> 01:53.479
<font color="#00FFFF">to the poetry recital last night.</font>

01:53.480 --> 01:55.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd have happily gone for free,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but as it was,</font>

01:55.480 --> 01:58.479
<font color="#00FFFF">the lady in question</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">give me 200 big ones.</font>

01:58.480 --> 02:01.479
<font color="#FFFF00">But you look like a dog's arse.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">With 200 big ones stuffed up it.</font>

02:01.480 --> 02:04.479
<font color="#11FF11">Water, barkeep, water, please.</font>

02:04.480 --> 02:05.480
Certainly, sir. Coming right up.

02:05.481 --> 02:07.479
<font color="#11FF11">Quick as you can,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm late for a meeting.</font>

02:07.480 --> 02:09.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Rampant out there, innit?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">And the rest.</font>

02:09.479 --> 02:11.479
<font color="#11FF11">I'm sweating like a priest</font>
<font color="#11FF11">at an orgy here.</font>

02:11.480 --> 02:14.319
In which case,
you're bound to enjoy an ice cube.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.479
A brand-new product guaranteed to
keep you and your drink supercool.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.479
<font color="#11FF11">Uh-huh. Fill her up, son. And don't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">let me forget this parasol.</font>

02:21.480 --> 02:23.479
<font color="#11FF11">I've lost two of the sodding things</font>
<font color="#11FF11">this week alone.</font>

02:23.480 --> 02:26.479
Of course. And how was that
ice for you? Refreshing, I bet.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Tell you what you need, mate...</font>
Would you recommend it to a friend?

02:29.480 --> 02:31.479
<font color="#00FFFF">A hands-free parasol.</font>
Grumio, please...

02:31.480 --> 02:35.479
<font color="#00FFFF">All the convenience of a hat,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">all the coverage of a brolly.</font>

02:35.480 --> 02:37.479
And going back to the ice...
<font color="#11FF11">Where did you get that from?</font>

02:37.480 --> 02:38.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I made it. It's mine.</font>

02:39.000 --> 02:43.479
<font color="#11FF11">Come and see me tomorrow.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Severus Galba. Businessman.</font>

02:43.480 --> 02:45.679
<font color="#11FF11">I'm always on the hunt</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for new ideas.</font>

02:45.680 --> 02:47.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Grumio. Ideas man.</font>

02:47.480 --> 02:50.479
<font color="#11FF11">Don't forget to come and see me.</font>

02:50.480 --> 02:51.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't forget your parasol.</font>

02:58.480 --> 03:01.479
So, Jason, what makes you think
you've got what it takes

03:01.480 --> 03:03.479
to become a Knight of Eros?

03:03.480 --> 03:06.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, for a start off,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my dating game is on point.</font>

03:06.520 --> 03:07.839
Is it really?

03:07.840 --> 03:09.479
How so?
<font color="#FFFF00">I look good,</font>

03:09.480 --> 03:10.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I smell good,</font>

03:10.481 --> 03:12.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I always keep a lady's wine glass</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">full to the brim.</font>

03:12.480 --> 03:14.479
OK, that's too full.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm a great listener.</font>

03:15.481 --> 03:17.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Or, like, I'm great at looking like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm listening,</font>

03:17.480 --> 03:20.159
<font color="#FFFF00">but really, I'm zoning out.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like this.</font>

03:20.160 --> 03:22.479
Right.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.479
Impressive. But I'm afraid our books
are full.

03:25.480 --> 03:28.479
<font color="#FFFF00">As if! You took Aurelius</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and he's a massive dweeby douche.</font>

03:28.480 --> 03:31.479
Aurelius, Aurelius...
Oh, yes. Him.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.519
<font color="#FFFF00">If that gimp's getting dates,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I should be, too.</font>

03:33.520 --> 03:35.479
I agree, he's quite niche.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Niche ain't it. He's a disgrace.</font>

03:38.480 --> 03:40.479
<font color="#FFFF00">You're giving a lonely lady</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the worst night ever.</font>

03:40.480 --> 03:43.480
<font color="#FFFF00">When she could be getting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the night of her life.</font>

03:45.480 --> 03:47.999
Look out for number 42.
He didn't give us a time, did he?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Didn't give US anything, mate.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm the one he wanted to see.</font>

03:50.480 --> 03:53.479
No, I know, but guys like this
can be sharks, Grumio.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.479
And you're some deformed
little seal pup.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.480
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get eaten alive.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.479
<font color="#11FF11">Well, I've run it past my backroom</font>
<font color="#11FF11">bods and they think it's a goer.</font>

04:02.480 --> 04:04.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Boom-ting.</font>
Boom-ting indeed.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.479
And did you happen to mention
the ice as well?

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
<font color="#11FF11">You what?</font>
From your drink?

04:07.481 --> 04:09.479
<font color="#00FFFF">What are you doing?</font>
Cos with a bit of seed money

04:09.480 --> 04:11.479
I could buy
a huge block of the stuff.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.479
<font color="#11FF11">OK, listen, I'm not</font>
<font color="#11FF11">one to fuck about with foreplay,</font>

04:13.480 --> 04:15.999
<font color="#11FF11">so I'll cut to the chase.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I like your idea, Grumio.</font>

04:16.000 --> 04:17.478
<font color="#11FF11">I want to develop it.</font>

04:17.480 --> 04:20.478
Fantastic. So maybe we could develop
both ideas in tandem.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
<font color="#11FF11">Why are you still talking?</font>

04:21.481 --> 04:25.319
<font color="#11FF11">In fact, why are you even here?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">This is between me and Grumio.</font>

04:25.320 --> 04:28.479
<font color="#00FFFF">He won't be told. </font>It's not just
between the two of you, I'm afraid.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.479
You see,
I happen to be Grumio's owner.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.679
<font color="#11FF11">Are you now?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Suddenly it all makes sense.</font>

04:32.680 --> 04:37.159
So, I also own all his intellectual
property. If you can call it that.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.839
<font color="#11FF11">I had an owner once myself.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Really?</font>

04:38.840 --> 04:42.159
<font color="#00FFFF">You were a slave?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Back in the day, yes, I was.</font>

04:42.160 --> 04:43.479
<font color="#11FF11">To another whiny little tit.</font>

04:43.480 --> 04:46.479
<font color="#00FFFF">But you've got your own desk</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and door and everything.</font>

04:46.480 --> 04:48.479
<font color="#11FF11">Well, I had some smart ideas.</font>

04:48.480 --> 04:50.519
<font color="#11FF11">Seized my opportunities,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">made myself some moolah.</font>

04:50.520 --> 04:52.479
<font color="#11FF11">And you can do the same, son.</font>
MARCUS SNORTS

04:52.480 --> 04:54.319
<font color="#11FF11">How's 200?</font>

04:54.320 --> 04:56.159
For what, sorry?
<font color="#11FF11">For Grumio.</font>

04:56.160 --> 04:58.159
<font color="#11FF11">I'll buy him off you,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">cut out the middle prick.</font>

04:58.160 --> 05:01.479
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not developing his ideas</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to make you rich, bozo.</font>

05:01.480 --> 05:03.479
Well, the two of us,
we need to discuss it...

05:03.480 --> 05:04.679
<font color="#00FFFF">No, we don't. He'll take it.</font>

05:04.680 --> 05:07.479
What, really?
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to go with him.</font>

05:07.480 --> 05:08.480
<font color="#00FFFF">And get some moolah</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and a big fat desk.</font>

05:08.481 --> 05:11.479
<font color="#00FFFF">He's a proper businessman,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">not some beaky numpty.</font>

05:11.480 --> 05:13.159
<font color="#11FF11">Atta boy, Grumio.</font>

05:13.160 --> 05:16.320
<font color="#11FF11">So, what do we say then, "master"?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Have we got a deal?</font>

05:19.480 --> 05:22.479
<font color="#FFFF00">What? You sold our mate</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for a block of ice?</font>

05:22.480 --> 05:23.519
Yeah.
Bought it off landlord.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.479
It's a fair exchange, really.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
One big lump for another.

05:26.481 --> 05:28.479
<font color="#11FF11">I must say, I'm a huge fan.</font>

05:28.480 --> 05:30.479
<font color="#11FF11">It has a frosty beauty,</font>

05:30.480 --> 05:33.479
<font color="#11FF11">a glimmering elegance,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">almost a sadness about it.</font>

05:33.480 --> 05:36.479
And it makes drinks colder.
That's the thing to tell people.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.999
In fact,
you two should get out there now

05:38.000 --> 05:39.839
and start handing out these flyers.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Er, no, sorry, I can't.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got a theatre date in a bit.</font>

05:42.480 --> 05:44.479
<font color="#11FF11">What, do you really? That's curious.</font>

05:44.480 --> 05:46.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Is it? Don't think so.</font>

05:46.480 --> 05:49.479
<font color="#11FF11">No, it's just that I had a theatre</font>
<font color="#11FF11">date myself through the agency,</font>

05:49.480 --> 05:51.319
<font color="#11FF11">which was then cancelled.</font>

05:51.320 --> 05:52.479
<font color="#11FF11">And now here you are, a buffoon,</font>

05:52.480 --> 05:54.839
<font color="#11FF11">with a theatre date</font>
<font color="#11FF11">all of your own.</font>

05:54.840 --> 05:56.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow. What a coincidence.</font>

05:56.480 --> 05:59.319
<font color="#11FF11">Let's see. Is your date</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with someone called Jocasta?</font>

05:59.320 --> 06:02.480
<font color="#FFFF00">No, it's with someone called</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">something else.</font>

06:04.480 --> 06:06.479
<font color="#11FF11">Come.</font>

06:06.480 --> 06:08.479
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, boss?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Got some doodles to show you.</font>

06:08.480 --> 06:10.479
<font color="#11FF11">Good lad. Let's have a squiz.</font>

06:10.480 --> 06:13.479
<font color="#00FFFF">So, we swap the fruit bowl</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for a headband</font>

06:13.480 --> 06:15.479
<font color="#00FFFF">and put a sunshade</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in place of the bin lid.</font>

06:15.480 --> 06:17.479
<font color="#11FF11">This is top drawer, Grumio.</font>

06:17.480 --> 06:19.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I got one of the grown-ups</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in product design to help me.</font>

06:19.840 --> 06:23.999
<font color="#11FF11">So, go on, what are we calling it?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I were thinking the para-hat-asol.</font>

06:24.000 --> 06:26.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Or the hands-free shady boy.</font>

06:26.480 --> 06:28.479
<font color="#11FF11">Good effort, but they're both shit.</font>

06:28.480 --> 06:31.479
<font color="#11FF11">How about we name it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">after its creator?</font>

06:31.480 --> 06:33.479
<font color="#11FF11">Let's call it the Grumbrella.</font>

06:33.480 --> 06:36.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know what to say, boss.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I love it.</font>

06:36.480 --> 06:38.479
<font color="#11FF11">You can stop calling me boss</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for one thing.</font>

06:38.480 --> 06:40.479
<font color="#11FF11">We're partners in this.</font>

06:40.480 --> 06:43.679
<font color="#11FF11">In fact, I'm gonna get a partnership</font>
<font color="#11FF11">agreement drawn up for you to sign.</font>

06:43.680 --> 06:46.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Wicked. I mean,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd have to draw up a signature</font>

06:46.480 --> 06:48.479
<font color="#00FFFF">cos I don't actually have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">one of them. </font><font color="#11FF11">You do that.</font>

06:48.480 --> 06:50.479
<font color="#11FF11">In the meantime,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">work on these designs.</font>

06:50.480 --> 06:52.519
<font color="#11FF11">We've got a Grumbrella to launch.</font>

06:52.520 --> 06:54.479
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, boss. All over it.</font>

06:54.480 --> 06:56.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Sorry, not boss.</font>

06:56.480 --> 06:58.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Partner.</font>

06:58.160 --> 07:00.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Mate. Severus.</font>

07:03.480 --> 07:07.479
<font color="#FFFF00">We give all we have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to our husbands,</font>

07:07.480 --> 07:11.480
<font color="#FFFF00">throwing ourselves</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on the mercy of his lust!</font>

07:12.480 --> 07:15.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I think that was the finest</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">production of Medea I've seen.</font>

07:15.480 --> 07:19.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I mean, that is true for me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">too, as it goes.</font>

07:19.320 --> 07:20.479
<font color="#00FFFF">You enjoyed it, then?</font>

07:20.480 --> 07:22.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I liked the costumes. And the blood.</font>

07:22.480 --> 07:24.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought it could have done</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with a couple of songs, you know,</font>

07:24.480 --> 07:27.479
<font color="#FFFF00">to lighten the mood. I mean,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that main lady, what's her name?</font>

07:27.480 --> 07:29.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Medea.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah,</font>

07:29.480 --> 07:30.999
<font color="#FFFF00">she was a bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of a Debbie Downer, weren't she?</font>

07:31.000 --> 07:33.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, you could say that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">given that she kills her children</font>

07:33.480 --> 07:34.480
<font color="#00FFFF">to spite her cheating husband.</font>

07:34.481 --> 07:36.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Hang on, did you say</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her name was Medea?</font>

07:36.480 --> 07:38.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos I just thought everyone</font>

07:38.480 --> 07:40.480
<font color="#FFFF00">was calling her "my dear"</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the whole time.</font>

07:42.320 --> 07:44.480
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm gonna go and powder my nose.</font>

07:48.480 --> 07:51.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa! Where did you come from?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I knew it wasn't a coincidence.</font>

07:51.480 --> 07:54.319
<font color="#11FF11">You stole my date, you devious dog.</font>

07:54.320 --> 07:55.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you follow us here?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Via the play, yes.</font>

07:55.480 --> 07:56.519
<font color="#11FF11">Though I'm glad I did.</font>

07:56.520 --> 07:59.479
<font color="#11FF11">That was genuinely the best</font>
<font color="#11FF11">production of Medea I've ever seen.</font>

07:59.480 --> 08:01.479
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, well, piss off before Jocasta</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">gets back.</font>

08:01.480 --> 08:03.479
<font color="#11FF11">Uh, no. You piss off,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you interloping shit!</font>

08:03.480 --> 08:05.479
<font color="#11FF11">She should be here with me.</font>

08:05.480 --> 08:08.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not leaving now, mate.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've not had my chicken burger yet.</font>

08:08.160 --> 08:09.479
<font color="#11FF11">Chicken burger (!)</font>

08:09.480 --> 08:12.479
<font color="#11FF11">I mean, you are so unsuitable</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for Jocasta, it's absurd.</font>

08:12.480 --> 08:14.479
<font color="#11FF11">I insist that you let me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">take over.</font>

08:14.480 --> 08:15.480
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, fine.</font>

08:15.481 --> 08:17.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Tomorrow, we'll go and see that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">snooty bloke from the agency</font>

08:18.000 --> 08:20.319
<font color="#FFFF00">and he can decide</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who's the best man for the job.</font>

08:20.320 --> 08:22.479
<font color="#FFFF00">All right?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Bring it on.</font>

08:22.480 --> 08:23.480
<font color="#11FF11">Your funeral, fucko.</font>

08:26.480 --> 08:28.479
Ta-da!

08:28.480 --> 08:30.479
Amazing, right?
<font color="#00FFFF">Mm.</font>

08:30.480 --> 08:32.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, it's a huge block of ice,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">yes.</font>

08:32.480 --> 08:35.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Still not quite sure why I had to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">come all the way down here, though.</font>

08:35.480 --> 08:39.479
So you could stroke it.
Go on. It's so cold and hard.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Ooh (!) Ooh (!)</font>

08:41.480 --> 08:43.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean, I hate to pour cold water</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on it, Marcus,</font>

08:43.840 --> 08:46.479
<font color="#00FFFF">but there is a growing pool</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of cold water on the floor.</font>

08:46.480 --> 08:48.479
There was a bit of run-off, sure.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.479
But you've got to try it.
See what you think.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm happy with room temperature</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">water, to be honest. </font>Right.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.479
Well, I guess your generation are
pretty resistant to new technology.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Excuse me, "My generation"?</font>

08:59.480 --> 09:01.999
Well, you are a fair bit older
than me, aren't you? <font color="#00FFFF">Charming (!)</font>

09:02.000 --> 09:04.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you point out the age</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of all your customers?</font>

09:04.480 --> 09:06.479
<font color="#00FFFF">It may explain why you are empty.</font>

09:06.480 --> 09:07.480
The customers will come.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.479
Just as soon as word spreads
about the ice.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.479
<font color="#00FFFF">And if they don't, you can just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stand here stroking it all day.</font>

09:12.480 --> 09:14.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Ooh...</font>

09:14.480 --> 09:16.679
Maybe stop doing that, actually.
You're making it melt faster. Hey!

09:16.680 --> 09:18.480
SHE LAUGHS

09:19.680 --> 09:22.479
<font color="#11FF11">We had a rapport...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You cannot send her back to him!</font>

09:22.480 --> 09:25.479
<font color="#11FF11">And frankly, I saw her first.</font>
OK, enough!

09:25.480 --> 09:28.479
Shush now. What exactly
do you want me to do about this?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I want you to put him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">out of his misery.</font>

09:30.480 --> 09:32.479
<font color="#11FF11">Choose one of us</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to continue dating Jocasta.</font>

09:32.480 --> 09:35.159
Well, maybe Jocasta
could choose for herself.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.479
As it happens, she came in
with her feedback form this morning.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Perfect. What's she got to say?</font>

09:40.480 --> 09:41.480
Well, starting with you, Jason.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.479
While she admits
you were easy on the eye,

09:43.480 --> 09:47.479
she describes your date as stilted
and intellectually arid.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.479
<font color="#11FF11">Yes! In your face! Arid.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You, sir, are arid.</font>

09:50.480 --> 09:54.479
As for you, Aurelius, she praises
your wit and sophistication,

09:54.480 --> 09:57.839
but found you visually challenging
and compares you to a greased goat.

09:57.840 --> 10:01.159
JASON LAUGHS
<font color="#FFFF00">See? I told you you was butters.</font>

10:01.160 --> 10:02.679
<font color="#11FF11">OK, so which one of us</font>
<font color="#11FF11">does she want to see again?</font>

10:02.680 --> 10:04.479
<font color="#11FF11">It's not completely clear.</font>

10:04.480 --> 10:05.679
Neither of you. Obviously.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.479
Nor will I be keeping you
on our books

10:08.480 --> 10:10.839
as it is evident
that both of you fall short

10:10.840 --> 10:14.000
of the Knights of Eros standards.
Goodbye.

10:18.680 --> 10:22.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my days. This is huge.</font>

10:22.480 --> 10:23.480
So huge.

10:23.481 --> 10:24.839
This can't all be for Grumio,
surely?

10:24.840 --> 10:26.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Easy, lads. Thanks for coming.</font>

10:26.480 --> 10:28.479
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, chilli-dog,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what's going on here?</font>

10:28.480 --> 10:29.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Who are all the togas?</font>

10:29.481 --> 10:32.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Just some influencers,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a few journos, the odd celeb.</font>

10:32.480 --> 10:35.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Severus likes to push the boat out</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for a product launch.</font>

10:35.480 --> 10:38.479
Yeah...
Grumio, it is quite a weird product.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.679
So don't expect them all to love it.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.479
Hope for the best, prepare
for the worst. Know what I mean?

10:42.480 --> 10:45.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers, Marcus. I knew I could trust</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you to bring the good vibes.</font>

10:45.480 --> 10:48.479
I also brought some flyers
about our ice.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.479
Do you think I could maybe
hand them to the influencers?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Definitely not, no.</font>

10:51.481 --> 10:53.479
<font color="#11FF11">Right, listen up, everyone.</font>

10:53.480 --> 10:56.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, here we go. Show time.</font>

10:56.480 --> 10:58.479
I'm just gonna pop them down here.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.839
<font color="#11FF11">When I first clapped eyes</font>
<font color="#11FF11">on the inventor of this product,</font>

11:00.840 --> 11:02.479
<font color="#11FF11">he reminded me a bit of myself.</font>

11:02.480 --> 11:05.479
<font color="#11FF11">A little slave with big ideas.</font>

11:05.480 --> 11:07.479
<font color="#11FF11">An idiot master holding him back.</font>

11:07.480 --> 11:09.479
<font color="#11FF11">All he needed was someone</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to give him a chance.</font>

11:09.480 --> 11:12.839
<font color="#11FF11">Grumio, come up here, son.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Introduce your idea.</font>

11:12.840 --> 11:15.160
SCATTERED APPLAUSE

11:17.000 --> 11:20.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Hiya. So all it is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">basically is a big brolly.</font>

11:20.480 --> 11:23.000
<font color="#00FFFF">But you don't have to hold it,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">cos it sits on your head.</font>

11:24.480 --> 11:27.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, and it's called the Grumbrella.</font>

11:27.480 --> 11:29.479
APPLAUSE, WHOOPING

11:29.480 --> 11:33.480
WHISTLING

11:35.480 --> 11:36.519
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah...</font>

11:36.520 --> 11:38.480
<font color="#00FFFF">One for the lads.</font>

11:46.480 --> 11:48.480
Oh, no, mate...

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes...</font>

11:53.460 --> 11:55.140
# Lucky seven! #

11:57.440 --> 12:01.440
For subtitling services, contatct:
waqas.zahoor89@gmail.com

12:08.043 --> 12:11.042
<font color="#00FFFF">So, I was thinking, maybe we should</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">kick on and expand the range?</font>

12:11.043 --> 12:12.921
<font color="#11FF11">Very sensible. What are we talking?</font>

12:12.923 --> 12:15.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, I wanna do a big one</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with sparkly ends like a crown</font>

12:15.923 --> 12:16.923
<font color="#00FFFF">called a Maxigrum,</font>

12:16.924 --> 12:19.762
<font color="#00FFFF">and a double one you can wear</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with your mate called a Chumgrum.</font>

12:19.763 --> 12:21.922
<font color="#11FF11">I love it! You're on fire, Grumio.</font>

12:21.923 --> 12:22.923
<font color="#00FFFF">I know I am.</font>

12:22.924 --> 12:24.922
<font color="#00FFFF">So I've also invented</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a fancy new signature</font>

12:24.923 --> 12:26.922
<font color="#00FFFF">so that we can finish</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the partnership thingy.</font>

12:26.923 --> 12:28.922
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, that, yeah.</font>

12:28.923 --> 12:31.922
<font color="#11FF11">My lawyer is just putting</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the finishing touches to that</font>

12:31.923 --> 12:32.923
<font color="#11FF11">so it's all nice and official.</font>

12:32.924 --> 12:34.922
<font color="#11FF11">But don't you worry about that.</font>

12:34.923 --> 12:37.923
<font color="#11FF11">You crack on with these new ideas,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your little legend!</font>

12:38.923 --> 12:39.923
<font color="#00FFFF">Will do!</font>

12:39.924 --> 12:42.923
<font color="#00FFFF">Oi! Small stitches, dickhead,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this is a quality product.</font>

12:44.923 --> 12:47.922
<font color="#11FF11">I mean, I got a one out of ten</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for appearance!</font>

12:47.923 --> 12:49.922
<font color="#11FF11">One!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That is harsh.</font>

12:49.923 --> 12:51.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Even I'd give you a two.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What did I get?</font>

12:51.923 --> 12:54.602
<font color="#00FFFF">Eight. But you got a nought for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">conversation, whereas I got a nine.</font>

12:54.603 --> 12:56.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Between us,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we'd have a near-perfect score.</font>

12:56.923 --> 12:58.922
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a shame we're not one person.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Ooh.</font>

12:58.923 --> 13:01.922
<font color="#00FFFF">What if we could be?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Hmm? How would that work?</font>

13:01.923 --> 13:03.762
<font color="#00FFFF">We go on dates together.</font>

13:03.763 --> 13:05.922
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not dating a one out of ten.</font>

13:05.923 --> 13:09.762
<font color="#00FFFF">No, I mean, we pool our resources,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">take ladies out as a pair.</font>

13:09.763 --> 13:11.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, shit, yeah!</font>

13:11.923 --> 13:14.922
<font color="#FFFF00">So I do the looking good</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and you do the talking good.</font>

13:14.923 --> 13:16.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Talking well.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Right. This is what I mean.</font>

13:16.923 --> 13:18.922
<font color="#11FF11">Glass of water please, barkeep.</font>

13:18.923 --> 13:20.442
Ah, hello Grumio.

13:20.443 --> 13:22.762
I see success has literally
gone to your head.

13:22.763 --> 13:24.922
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, this?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's just a Maxigrum, mate,</font>

13:24.923 --> 13:26.922
<font color="#11FF11">a big ballsy bastard</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for fans of the brand.</font>

13:26.923 --> 13:29.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah man, congrats,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the Grumbrellas are everywhere.</font>

13:29.923 --> 13:31.922
<font color="#11FF11">We are shifting stock, it's true.</font>

13:31.923 --> 13:33.922
<font color="#11FF11">How's it going with the ice?</font>
Great, thanks.

13:33.923 --> 13:35.922
Our stock is also shifting.
<font color="#11FF11">Oh yeah?</font>

13:35.923 --> 13:38.922
<font color="#11FF11">Cos people are buying it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">or cos it's melting onto the floor?</font>

13:38.923 --> 13:39.923
Bit of both.

13:39.924 --> 13:42.922
<font color="#11FF11">Mainly melting though, ain't it?</font>
What do you actually want, Grumio?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.922
Why are you here?
<font color="#11FF11">Just came to say hi.</font>

13:44.923 --> 13:46.922
<font color="#11FF11">And to let you know</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that I'm hiring a PA.</font>

13:46.923 --> 13:47.923
<font color="#11FF11">Thought I'd give you first refusal.</font>

13:47.924 --> 13:49.962
And I refuse, thanks.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.922
I've got bigger career ambitions

13:51.923 --> 13:53.922
than being
my former slave's secretary.

13:53.923 --> 13:56.923
<font color="#11FF11">Oh well, hope for the best,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">prepare for the worst, eh?</font>

13:57.923 --> 13:59.443
CRUNCH

14:05.923 --> 14:06.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you sure this is the one?</font>

14:06.924 --> 14:08.922
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, I stalked her home</font>
<font color="#11FF11">after our date.</font>

14:08.923 --> 14:09.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Stalked?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Walked.</font>

14:09.924 --> 14:11.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Which one was it?</font>

14:11.123 --> 14:12.922
<font color="#11FF11">Well, both actually.</font>

14:12.923 --> 14:15.122
<font color="#11FF11">I walked her some of the way</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and then stalked her the rest.</font>

14:15.123 --> 14:17.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Jocasta, hey! Remember us?</font>

14:17.923 --> 14:20.922
Oh, yes, hello.
You two know each other.

14:20.923 --> 14:21.923
How odd.
<font color="#11FF11">We do indeed.</font>

14:21.924 --> 14:23.922
We're great buds.

14:23.923 --> 14:25.922
What a charming story.
Now, I'm late for my chiropractor.

14:25.923 --> 14:26.923
<font color="#11FF11">We won't keep you.</font>

14:26.924 --> 14:28.922
<font color="#11FF11">We're just here to pitch you</font>

14:28.923 --> 14:30.922
<font color="#11FF11">a bold new take</font>
<font color="#11FF11">on the escorting industry.</font>

14:30.923 --> 14:32.442
Right, which is...?

14:32.443 --> 14:35.762
<font color="#FFFF00">Say hello to your favourite</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">new agency, the Candy Boys.</font>

14:35.763 --> 14:37.922
<font color="#FFFF00">I bring the eye candy, you see this.</font>

14:37.923 --> 14:39.922
<font color="#FFFF00">He brings the ear candy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you hear that.</font>

14:39.923 --> 14:41.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Two for the price of one.</font>

14:41.923 --> 14:42.923
Right.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.282
But I still have to look at that.
as in him?

14:45.283 --> 14:47.122
<font color="#11FF11">I could stay out of your eyeline</font>
<font color="#11FF11">if you'd prefer.</font>

14:47.123 --> 14:48.282
I'd insist.

14:48.283 --> 14:49.922
And you'd stay silent?

14:49.923 --> 14:50.923
<font color="#11FF11">He would.</font>

14:50.924 --> 14:52.602
<font color="#11FF11">And as our first client,</font>

14:52.603 --> 14:54.762
<font color="#11FF11">we could give you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the initial date half price.</font>

14:54.763 --> 14:56.763
<font color="#FFFF00">Two for the price of ha...</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Shush!</font>

14:59.923 --> 15:02.442
<font color="#00FFFF">Secretary!</font>

15:02.443 --> 15:04.922
All right, all right,
keep your brolly on.

15:04.923 --> 15:05.923
What is it now?

15:05.923 --> 15:06.923
<font color="#00FFFF">Anything in the in-tray?</font>

15:06.924 --> 15:09.762
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm waiting for a partnership thingy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from Severus.</font>

15:09.763 --> 15:10.922
Well, we got a shitload more

15:10.923 --> 15:13.922
of these customer complaint letters
in, yeah.

15:13.923 --> 15:15.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh. frigging hell, what now?</font>

15:15.923 --> 15:18.922
Some dopey bastard got a spoke
in his eye from the Megagrum.

15:18.923 --> 15:20.922
<font color="#00FFFF">The Maxigrum.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">If you're gonna be my secretary,</font>

15:20.923 --> 15:22.922
<font color="#00FFFF">you've got to learn</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the product names.</font>

15:22.923 --> 15:23.923
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.922
And then two more injured
on the Mateygrum.

15:26.923 --> 15:28.922
<font color="#00FFFF">The Chumgrum.</font>
Ha!

15:28.923 --> 15:31.922
Twisted their necks
trying to go in opposite directions.

15:31.923 --> 15:33.922
Numpties.

15:33.923 --> 15:36.922
Oh yeah,
this one says he's gonna sue.

15:36.923 --> 15:38.602
<font color="#00FFFF">Stupid bloody public fools.</font>

15:38.603 --> 15:40.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Can't see genius</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">when it pokes them in the eye.</font>

15:40.923 --> 15:43.922
So it's their fault, is it?
Is that how we're gonna respond?

15:43.923 --> 15:45.922
<font color="#00FFFF">No. We're not responding at all.</font>

15:45.923 --> 15:48.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Bin 'em. Bin all the bad ones.</font>
Lovely.

15:48.923 --> 15:50.602
That is so much better.

15:50.603 --> 15:53.923
<font color="#00FFFF">And find me some fan mail, dammit,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it's what I bloody well deserve.</font>

15:55.923 --> 15:57.922
It's getting smaller by the day.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I mean it will do that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it's like an inbuilt design feature.</font>

16:00.923 --> 16:03.922
No, I know. But there's gotta be
a way to slow it down.

16:03.923 --> 16:05.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, pack it in ice.</font>

16:05.123 --> 16:06.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Keep the ice nice and icy.</font>

16:06.923 --> 16:09.122
Right, and how about that ice?
How do I keep that cold?

16:09.123 --> 16:11.442
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, again, more ice</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and on it goes.</font>

16:11.443 --> 16:14.122
<font color="#00FFFF">It takes ice to keep ice.</font>
No, sorry, this is ridiculous.

16:14.123 --> 16:15.922
New plan.

16:15.923 --> 16:16.923
If the people won't come to the ice,

16:16.924 --> 16:18.922
the ice will have to come
to the people.

16:18.923 --> 16:20.762
Let's go, boys,
we're hitting the streets.

16:20.763 --> 16:22.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no, sorry, we can't.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We've got a hot date.</font>

16:22.923 --> 16:23.923
What? Both of you?

16:23.924 --> 16:26.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Big times. I bring the looks.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">And I bring the noise.</font>

16:26.923 --> 16:29.602
<font color="#FFFF00">And together we are...</font>
BOTH: <font color="#11FF11">The Candy Boys.</font>

16:29.603 --> 16:30.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Bit weird.</font>

16:30.923 --> 16:31.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Good luck with it, though.</font>

16:31.924 --> 16:33.922
Oi! Stop melting my ice.

16:33.923 --> 16:35.923
<font color="#FFFF00">She's not gonna be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">looking at you, anyway.</font>

16:37.923 --> 16:38.923
I love this piece.

16:38.924 --> 16:40.922
It's so vivid, static,

16:40.923 --> 16:42.922
yet somehow full of life.

16:42.923 --> 16:43.923
<font color="#11FF11">Absolutely.</font>

16:43.924 --> 16:45.922
<font color="#11FF11">The blue veins</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of the Carrara marble</font>

16:45.923 --> 16:47.922
<font color="#11FF11">seem to evoke the very blood</font>
<font color="#11FF11">pulsing through him.</font>

16:47.923 --> 16:48.923
Mmm.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.762
You can almost hear the shrill hoot
of his pipe being blown.

16:52.763 --> 16:53.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh-er!</font>

16:55.123 --> 16:56.923
<font color="#11FF11">Ooh, sorry.</font>

16:58.283 --> 16:59.922
Now, what do you know of this one?

16:59.923 --> 17:00.923
<font color="#11FF11">Erm... Ionian.</font>

17:00.924 --> 17:02.922
<font color="#11FF11">Maybe 500 years old,</font>

17:02.923 --> 17:05.923
<font color="#11FF11">a classic depiction of Ulysses</font>
<font color="#11FF11">beating off the one-eyed monster.</font>

17:08.603 --> 17:10.922
What would you stay
is your favourite style of column?

17:10.923 --> 17:12.922
<font color="#11FF11">I like an Ionian -</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of course, who doesn't?</font>

17:12.923 --> 17:14.962
<font color="#11FF11">But really, for me,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's fluted Corinthian,</font>

17:14.963 --> 17:16.922
<font color="#11FF11">every day of the week.</font>
Ah.

17:16.923 --> 17:18.922
Ice!

17:18.923 --> 17:20.922
Ice cube.

17:20.923 --> 17:23.922
How many species of tree do you
think you could name in this grove?

17:23.923 --> 17:25.922
<font color="#11FF11">I think I could manage</font>
<font color="#11FF11">all 48 of them.</font>

17:25.923 --> 17:26.923
Ice?

17:26.923 --> 17:27.923
Right you are.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.282
Here you go.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.922
THUNDER

17:31.923 --> 17:32.963
Ah.

17:38.923 --> 17:40.922
<font color="#11FF11">Oi, I want a word with you.</font>

17:40.923 --> 17:43.922
<font color="#00FFFF">'Ey up, Severus, I'm working</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on a new Grumbrella for kids.</font>

17:43.923 --> 17:45.922
<font color="#00FFFF">It's called</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the Can-I-Have-One-Mum-Grum.</font>

17:45.923 --> 17:46.923
<font color="#00FFFF">What do you reckon?</font>

17:46.924 --> 17:49.762
<font color="#11FF11">I reckon you should wear</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a Bloody Prize Plumgrum,</font>

17:49.763 --> 17:50.922
<font color="#11FF11">that's what I reckon.</font>

17:50.923 --> 17:52.922
<font color="#11FF11">Have you had any</font>
<font color="#11FF11">letters from lawyers recently?</font>

17:52.923 --> 17:55.282
<font color="#00FFFF">Er, might have done, yeah, why?</font>

17:55.283 --> 17:56.922
<font color="#11FF11">About 40 of the flesh eating fuckers</font>

17:56.923 --> 17:58.922
<font color="#11FF11">are threatening to sue me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a new arsehole, that's why.</font>

17:58.923 --> 18:01.922
<font color="#11FF11">Punters keep getting skewered</font>
<font color="#11FF11">by your products.</font>

18:01.923 --> 18:04.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, the moaning minnies</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">aren't still bleating on, are they?</font>

18:04.923 --> 18:06.922
<font color="#11FF11">Not all of them, no.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">One of them died.</font>

18:06.923 --> 18:08.922
<font color="#11FF11">Couldn't see past</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the massive spokes,</font>

18:08.923 --> 18:10.122
<font color="#11FF11">got hit by a wagon!</font>

18:10.123 --> 18:11.922
<font color="#11FF11">So he's not bleating on,</font>

18:11.923 --> 18:14.602
<font color="#11FF11">but his family are bleating on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">very loudly.</font>

18:14.603 --> 18:16.762
<font color="#00FFFF">Just get your lawyer to tell them</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to naff off.</font>

18:16.763 --> 18:18.922
<font color="#00FFFF">He must have finished our</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">partnership thingy by now, surely?</font>

18:18.923 --> 18:21.922
<font color="#11FF11">No, he's...</font>

18:21.923 --> 18:23.922
<font color="#11FF11">I tell you what.</font>

18:23.923 --> 18:25.962
<font color="#11FF11">Why don't we forget about</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the partnership thingy</font>

18:25.963 --> 18:27.922
<font color="#11FF11">and put the Grumbrella</font>
<font color="#11FF11">part of the business</font>

18:27.923 --> 18:29.922
<font color="#11FF11">entirely in your name?</font>

18:29.923 --> 18:32.602
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah? Really?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Why not?</font>

18:32.603 --> 18:35.922
<font color="#11FF11">It's your baby after all,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I just helped yank it out of you.</font>

18:35.923 --> 18:38.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Right. So when my ideas</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are raking it in,</font>

18:38.923 --> 18:39.923
<font color="#00FFFF">you can't be arsed,</font>

18:39.924 --> 18:43.762
<font color="#00FFFF">but when they're making people mardy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">or, you know, dead,</font>

18:43.763 --> 18:45.922
<font color="#00FFFF">suddenly you want me to go it alone,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is that right?</font>

18:45.923 --> 18:48.922
<font color="#11FF11">I just want you to forge ahead,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Grumio, be your own man.</font>

18:48.923 --> 18:50.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Hmm. Ta.</font>

18:50.123 --> 18:53.922
<font color="#00FFFF">But I reckon I'd rather</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be your man right now, boss.</font>

Oh, goodness me, what a downpour.

19:12.123 --> 19:14.922
<font color="#11FF11">Well, all that humidity</font>
<font color="#11FF11">had to break sooner or later.</font>

19:14.923 --> 19:15.923
Yes.

19:15.924 --> 19:18.443
Let's get you out of those
wet clothes.

19:21.923 --> 19:22.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Mmm.</font>

19:22.924 --> 19:25.602
<font color="#FFFF00">Mmm!</font>
No, not you.

19:25.603 --> 19:28.922
God, you plebeian oinking
is a real passion killer.

19:28.923 --> 19:30.762
That's your department back there.

19:30.763 --> 19:33.122
<font color="#11FF11">Including, you want me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to make pleasure noises as well?</font>

19:33.123 --> 19:35.283
All the noises, that was the deal.

19:36.923 --> 19:37.923
<font color="#11FF11">Ooh, mmm.</font>

19:37.924 --> 19:39.922
<font color="#11FF11">Oh. ooh, lovely.</font>

19:39.923 --> 19:42.923

19:44.923 --> 19:45.923
<font color="#11FF11">Argh!</font>

19:45.924 --> 19:50.442
Oh, Jason, you are sexy.

19:50.443 --> 19:52.282
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, thank you. I work out.</font>

19:52.283 --> 19:53.922
Talk dirty to me.

19:53.923 --> 19:55.602
<font color="#11FF11">All right, yep.</font>

19:55.603 --> 19:56.922
<font color="#11FF11">Erm...</font>

19:56.923 --> 20:00.442
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, I'm gonna wreck you,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you filthy lady.</font>

20:00.443 --> 20:02.922
<font color="#11FF11">Do your worst.</font>
I plan to.

20:02.923 --> 20:05.922
Are you cool if we get a bit kinky?

20:05.923 --> 20:09.763
<font color="#11FF11">Er, yeah, of course, I'd love that.</font>

20:10.923 --> 20:14.922
<font color="#11FF11">You're gonna need a safe word</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in case things get a bit much.</font>

20:14.923 --> 20:17.922
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, right, like 'stop' or 'don't'?</font>

20:17.923 --> 20:19.922
Just pick one!

20:19.923 --> 20:21.763
<font color="#11FF11">Mummy. Let's, let's go with 'mummy'.</font>

20:23.923 --> 20:24.923
Oh yeah.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.602
Here it comes.

20:27.603 --> 20:28.922
<font color="#11FF11">Ooh.</font>

20:28.923 --> 20:30.922
<font color="#11FF11">Mmm. Wow.</font>

five Chumgrums,

20:45.924 --> 20:49.923
a large mahogany desk,
three ink pots and one small slave.

20:50.923 --> 20:52.922
Poor old Severus.

20:52.923 --> 20:54.922
Spends 25 years
building up his business,

20:54.923 --> 20:56.922
meets you and then loses it
all in a couple of weeks.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Might've known you'd sniff out</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a closing down sale, you tightwad.</font>

20:59.923 --> 21:02.923
Well, I thought I might buy a few
Grumbrellas at a knockdown price.

21:04.923 --> 21:06.922
I'm sorry for doubting you, Grumio.

21:06.923 --> 21:08.922
It was actually quite a good idea,
it turns out,

21:08.923 --> 21:10.922
until it killed people.

21:10.923 --> 21:12.602
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers.</font>

21:12.603 --> 21:14.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't suppose you fancy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">buying the inventor, do you?</font>

21:14.923 --> 21:16.602
LAUGHS

21:16.603 --> 21:18.922
55 dinari! Bloody hell.

21:18.923 --> 21:20.923
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll do you a discount.</font>

21:25.923 --> 21:29.922
<font color="#11FF11">I was stuck behind the sofa,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">how could I see what she was doing?</font>

21:29.923 --> 21:32.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I've got wax burns</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on my ballbag now, thanks to you.</font>

21:32.923 --> 21:34.922
<font color="#FFFF00">And who has 'mummy'</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as their safe word, you sicko?</font>

21:34.923 --> 21:38.922
Ha! So I take it the Candy Boys
have ceased operations?

21:38.923 --> 21:39.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, well, I can't sit down.</font>

21:39.924 --> 21:41.922
<font color="#FFFF00">That makes dinner dates</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit trickier.</font>

21:41.923 --> 21:43.922
<font color="#FFFF00">Actually, have you got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">any more ice left?</font>

21:43.923 --> 21:46.922
Yes. There's, like,
one tiny cube around somewhere.

21:46.923 --> 21:48.922
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, I think I might have got it.</font>

21:48.923 --> 21:50.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't bite it!</font>

21:53.923 --> 21:56.923
<font color="#FFFF00">Ahhh, that is well soothing.</font>
