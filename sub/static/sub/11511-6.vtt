Well,

12:29.563 --> 12:31.907
we had to help clean up
the oil spill last year.

12:32.398 --> 12:34.235

Okay, Nate,

12:43.326 --> 12:44.355
if there's anything illegal

12:44.380 --> 12:46.379
happening in those warehouses,

12:46.849 --> 12:48.448
Christina and I
might be able to use that

12:48.481 --> 12:50.295
to get you out of here.

12:51.258 --> 12:52.959
We just unload boxes.

12:53.638 --> 12:54.957
Shirts and shoes.

12:55.044 --> 12:55.990
Junk like that.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.101
What about the Bausch Nursery trucks?

12:58.837 --> 13:00.028
I don't work on those.

13:00.062 --> 13:01.029
Why not?

13:01.062 --> 13:02.298
The trustees handle them.

13:02.378 --> 13:04.480
And why are the trustees allowed
to touch them and not you?

13:04.513 --> 13:06.958
I don't know! Ask the guards.

13:06.991 --> 13:08.518
All right, I want you to listen to me.

13:09.454 --> 13:11.594
That nursery's owned by a drug dealer.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.535
And we suspect that those warehouses

13:14.560 --> 13:16.976
are tied to his business,
but what I can't do

13:17.009 --> 13:18.745
with a suspicion
is take it to the police

13:18.770 --> 13:22.380
and use that as probable cause
to look into those shipments.

13:22.412 --> 13:24.192
So I need something specific.

13:24.225 --> 13:25.936
Something you've actually seen.

13:26.724 --> 13:28.181
I don't want to get in trouble.

13:29.419 --> 13:31.172
You don't know what it's like in here.

13:32.539 --> 13:34.307
Actually, Nate, I do.

13:36.203 --> 13:37.947
You don't have to be afraid.

13:38.395 --> 13:39.715
Everything you tell me is confidential.

13:39.748 --> 13:41.884
It's all attorney/client privilege

13:41.917 --> 13:45.250

13:47.036 --> 13:49.296

13:51.837 --> 13:53.492
There was this one time.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.731
The train came in
and they were moving the bags,

13:58.577 --> 14:00.003
and... and one got dropped.

14:00.698 --> 14:02.884
It spilled and the stuff that came out,

14:02.917 --> 14:04.760
it, it wasn't fertilizer.

14:05.326 --> 14:06.709
It was bricks

14:07.520 --> 14:08.858
wrapped up like...

14:10.146 --> 14:11.354
like cocaine.

14:12.026 --> 14:13.749
How often do these shipments come in?

14:14.243 --> 14:15.119
Twice a week.

14:15.806 --> 14:16.987
Mondays and Wednesdays.

14:17.019 --> 14:19.124
Wednesdays as in today?

14:19.157 --> 14:20.157
Yeah.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.393
Usually late afternoon.

MARINA: <i>So, I was in Dallas yesterday</i>

14:28.637 --> 14:30.636

14:30.661 --> 14:32.027
You worked with Kurt Hayley, correct?

14:32.101 --> 14:34.169
Oh, no, we're not here
to answer more questions.

14:34.203 --> 14:35.938
You said you wanted to talk settlement.

14:35.971 --> 14:37.485
So, is there an offer or not?

14:37.517 --> 14:38.510
Yes.

14:39.533 --> 14:42.543
We're offering not to pursue our
defense if you drop your case.

14:42.576 --> 14:44.597
We drove all the way over here for this?

14:44.630 --> 14:46.147
We know about David Such, Ms. Holden.

14:47.290 --> 14:47.984
Who?

14:48.166 --> 14:49.637
Married father of four.

14:49.684 --> 14:51.185
Deacon in his church.

14:51.218 --> 14:52.899
Resident of Plano, Texas.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.393
Your client is having
an affair with him.

14:56.223 --> 14:57.759
You bitch.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.235
Tammy, don't say anything.

14:59.496 --> 15:01.899
Even if it's true,
it's absolutely irrelevant

15:01.932 --> 15:03.100
- to the claims in this case.
- Not true.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.603
We have eight instances so far

15:05.635 --> 15:07.038
where your client claims
she was at work,

15:07.071 --> 15:09.540
when she was apparently with Mr. Such.

15:09.572 --> 15:11.808
If she lied about her whereabouts,

15:11.841 --> 15:14.611
we're entitled to explore that
by taking Mr. Such's deposition.

15:15.287 --> 15:17.118
Or you can drop the case.

15:17.779 --> 15:18.780
We will sign

15:18.814 --> 15:20.812
this release form,
keeping it all confidential.

15:21.119 --> 15:23.155
No one will ever have to know.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.838
GIL: I'll tell you what, she better

15:38.871 --> 15:41.608
be charging a premium for all
that effort she's putting in.

15:42.211 --> 15:44.410
It's got to be Dooley's, right?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.920
I mean, unless she's
turnin' tricks with Bigfoot,

15:46.945 --> 15:48.195
I'd say it's a lock.

15:49.791 --> 15:51.151

15:59.238 --> 16:00.526
We got him.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.430
(door closes)

16:04.463 --> 16:06.606
(exhales)
Still got the gun in the truck?

16:08.030 --> 16:09.269
You sure you want to know?

16:10.039 --> 16:11.070
G...

16:11.103 --> 16:12.891
the guy in that house killed Boots.

16:12.924 --> 16:14.107
Well, what is it?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.442
You telling me
you want to do something here,

16:15.474 --> 16:17.109
with Stripper-gram still inside?

16:17.142 --> 16:19.112
(sighs)

16:19.145 --> 16:21.514
All right, you know what? We wait.

16:22.238 --> 16:24.084
Hang back until she leaves.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.419
(phone rings)

16:26.452 --> 16:28.421
- (phone beeps on)
- What's up, Jackie?

16:28.454 --> 16:30.390
We were right. It's all connected.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.159
The warehouses, prison labor, Terry.

16:33.191 --> 16:34.838
That's how he gets his coke
into the country.

16:34.872 --> 16:36.228
How-how do you know?

16:36.261 --> 16:38.126
I talked to a kid inside.
He saw it for himself.

16:38.159 --> 16:40.432
He brings it in by train
in fertilizer bags,

16:40.465 --> 16:42.701
and there is a huge shipment
coming in today.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.504
I had to go ten rounds with
the DEA, but I got 'em on board.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.239
They're fast-tracking a move
as we speak.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.108
I'm on my way now to be there
when it happens.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.542
Slow down. When what happens?

16:50.575 --> 16:52.579
The DEA's raiding the warehouse.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.338
When that shipment comes in,
we have Terry dead to rights.

16:55.370 --> 16:57.442
This is huge.
We're about to put Terry away.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.337
This is everything
we've been working towards.

16:59.369 --> 17:01.233
Not-not everything.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.289
We found Dooley.

17:03.321 --> 17:04.020
Who?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.259
The redheaded prick who shanked Boots.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.894
We got eyes on him right now.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.530
Well done.
But, no, you have to stand down.

17:10.561 --> 17:11.630
Why? For... What for?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.133
We can't risk him seeing you.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.467
It might alert Terry
that he's being watched.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.402
SHAWN: Jackie,

17:16.714 --> 17:18.471
it took some doing
to find this guy, man.

17:18.502 --> 17:20.540
- We might lose him again.
- Doesn't matter, Shawnie.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.608
Not when we're this close
to blindsiding Terry.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.210
So we're supposed to just let him walk?

17:24.242 --> 17:25.444
No one's walking.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.445
When Terry falls, Dooley goes with him.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.216
We just have to sit back
and watch it happen.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.684
It's out of our hands now.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.129
Congrats, boys. That's one down.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.556
All right, copy that.

17:37.023 --> 17:37.857
All right, I'm gonna call you

17:37.889 --> 17:39.805
when the dust settles. See you later.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.162
(phone beeps off)

17:43.195 --> 17:45.112
Hey, listen.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.599
Whatever you want to do,
just know I'm with you.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.071
Let's get out of here.

17:53.438 --> 17:55.441
(starts engine)

18:06.351 --> 18:08.540
MAN (on TV): That's why he called
me over to the hospital.

18:09.313 --> 18:10.589
Alice Ann!

18:10.623 --> 18:13.560
(chuckles) Oh, hell.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.562
Oh, good. I see you found the bourbon.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.965
Mm. And I see you are getting
a little soft in the middle.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.769
Oh, well, what can I say,
life's been good.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.803
- I see you're keeping it tight though.
- (whoops)

18:24.837 --> 18:26.306
Wh-What's the secret?

18:26.338 --> 18:28.120
Cigarettes and Kegels.

18:28.154 --> 18:29.309
I should write a book.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.642
(both chuckle)

18:30.675 --> 18:31.610
Hey, so, where's Jessie?

18:31.644 --> 18:34.480
Said she was going to work,
last I saw her.

18:34.512 --> 18:35.682
Oh, yeah?

18:35.714 --> 18:36.983
I just stopped by the cafe.

18:37.015 --> 18:38.650
They said they hadn't seen her all day.

18:39.377 --> 18:41.453
Maybe she's running out on your ass.

18:41.486 --> 18:43.489
(chuckles)

18:48.219 --> 18:49.561
RAY: Hopper's playing hard to get.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.365
He agrees with me on policy,
but he's stalling.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.832
He's always slow to write a check.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.835
That's why we're bringing Jessie here.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.370
- (chuckles)
- Can't catch bear with a bulldog.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.440
- Hang on. We're flying to Austin?
- Yep.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.508
The mayor's hosting
a little get-together.

19:02.540 --> 19:03.909
It's a short hop.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.945
(phone ringing)

19:09.014 --> 19:10.515
- (beeps)
- You need to take that?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.066
Sorry. No.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.322
Here we go.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.823
How'd my assistant do?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.891
Well, I was wondering
where all those donations

19:18.924 --> 19:21.493
- I've been raising go.
- (laughs)

19:21.977 --> 19:23.563
All right, come on.

19:23.907 --> 19:25.031
If we hurry, we might have time

19:25.063 --> 19:27.699
to hit my favorite barbecue
place before the party.

19:28.331 --> 19:29.915
Have a good trip.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.771
Wait a minute, you're
not coming with us?

19:32.804 --> 19:34.873
No, the boss wants you all to himself.

19:39.544 --> 19:42.715
Don't worry. I'll get
you home before bedtime.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.666
(indistinct chatter, phones ringing)

19:47.698 --> 19:49.128
I'm looking for Jessie West.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.092
And you are?

19:51.222 --> 19:52.590
Her boyfriend. I need to talk to her.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.997
She's with the candidate right now.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.225
Come again?

19:56.259 --> 19:58.667
At a fund-raiser in Austin.
They'll be back

19:58.692 --> 20:00.119
- later tonight.
- Hang on.

20:00.259 --> 20:02.681
Jessie's in Austin with Ray Carroll?

20:02.713 --> 20:04.264
- Are they alone?
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.298 --> 20:05.932
He really likes her.

20:05.965 --> 20:07.267
That's quite a gal you have there.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.068
Uh, here's
what's gonna happen... Martha.

20:09.102 --> 20:10.721
You need to tell me
exactly where this thing

20:10.754 --> 20:12.506
- is taking place right now.
- Well, it's a private event,

20:12.538 --> 20:13.941
and I'm not sure...

20:13.973 --> 20:15.475
Martha, come on, listen,
if you can't tell me,

20:15.509 --> 20:17.310
then just point me in the
direction of someone who can.

20:17.344 --> 20:19.179
Uh, I-I don't even know...

20:19.211 --> 20:21.115
Hey! Hey, hey! Who can tell
me where this fund-raiser's

20:21.147 --> 20:22.415
- taking place?
- Excuse me, sir.

20:22.449 --> 20:24.269
Some kind of problem here?

20:28.154 --> 20:29.294
There's no problem.

Jessie here is the reason we're gonna

22:14.917 --> 22:16.653
win this thing. She is our finest

22:16.686 --> 22:18.260

22:18.454 --> 22:21.209
Committed, passionate, smart as a whip.

22:21.957 --> 22:24.028
So, you must really
be into Ray's policies.

22:24.062 --> 22:26.078
Oh, when there's an open bar, of course.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.564
- (laughs)
- Ah.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.086
You know, Roland's daddy was one of

22:29.119 --> 22:31.074
the first men to pull natural gas out of

22:31.099 --> 22:33.936
the Pecos fields. Now they have
a string of shopping centers

22:33.969 --> 22:35.990
and car dealerships all over the state.

22:36.357 --> 22:38.594
You're burying the lead.
If I'm not mistaken,

22:38.626 --> 22:40.495
you underwrote the new
cancer clinic at Tech, right?

22:40.529 --> 22:42.565
Oh, was that us?

22:42.597 --> 22:44.014

22:44.047 --> 22:45.840
I can never track of what buildings

22:45.873 --> 22:48.270
have our name on 'em in this world.

22:48.302 --> 22:50.827
So... where are you from, Jessie?

22:52.253 --> 22:54.422
To an excellent settlement.

22:54.447 --> 22:55.865
To many more.

22:58.843 --> 23:01.012
Look, um, we have a slick

23:01.045 --> 23:02.247
PowerPoint presentation ready and we're

23:02.279 --> 23:03.947
more than prepared to give you a full

23:03.981 --> 23:06.084
dog and pony show, but I feel like

23:06.116 --> 23:08.430
we're friendly enough
to drop the pretense.

23:09.623 --> 23:11.015
We want your business.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.967
All of it.

23:14.208 --> 23:15.912
I have to ask...

23:16.788 --> 23:18.811
if Tammy hadn't dropped the case,

23:19.029 --> 23:21.055
were you really going
to depose her lover?

23:21.684 --> 23:23.653
Honestly, I doubt
it would have come to that.

23:23.678 --> 23:24.746
It could have.

23:24.815 --> 23:26.607
Were you really willing to go that far?

23:27.270 --> 23:29.931
To damage two innocent families?

23:29.956 --> 23:32.376
Well, obviously, I would have
discussed it with you first

23:32.401 --> 23:34.425
and decided how
we wanted to move forward.

23:34.892 --> 23:36.031
But, bottom line,

23:36.298 --> 23:37.599
our priority lies with the client

23:37.631 --> 23:40.235
and doing whatever it takes
to win their case.

23:46.407 --> 23:47.442
What's this?

23:47.475 --> 23:49.778
Closing documents on an A building

23:49.811 --> 23:51.346
that we're buying in Phoenix.

23:51.379 --> 23:53.415
Litigation's one thing,
but I'm looking for

23:53.447 --> 23:54.586
a full-service firm.

23:54.949 --> 23:57.351
(sighs) This is one long audition.

23:57.385 --> 23:58.754
(laughs)

23:58.786 --> 24:00.577
Well, it's an important hire.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.497
Can you stay for dinner?

24:04.851 --> 24:05.991
You mean now?

24:06.025 --> 24:07.056
Yes.

24:07.395 --> 24:08.601
I hate to eat alone.

24:08.971 --> 24:11.433
I can have my guy whip up something.

24:11.465 --> 24:15.369
- Unless...
- No, that... that sounds great.

24:15.402 --> 24:16.667
Let's do it.

24:17.871 --> 24:18.955
Good.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.154
I'm sorry, sir, we're closing down.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.712
Oh, I'm sure we could
squeeze in a couple more.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.961
How about two of whatever you
got in that bottle right there?

24:31.102 --> 24:32.404
Thank you.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.057
Why stop now, right?

24:36.574 --> 24:38.577
Thank you.

24:39.415 --> 24:41.474
I've seen you making your
rounds, and you can relax.

24:41.641 --> 24:43.074
Ray already has my check.

24:43.354 --> 24:45.528
Wow, if only everybody was this easy.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.924
Yeah.

24:48.293 --> 24:50.260
But don't confuse me
with these other suckers.

24:50.670 --> 24:53.797
Unlike them,
I know what my money's buying.

24:55.370 --> 24:57.635
So... long-time supporter?

24:57.667 --> 24:59.436
25 years.

24:59.997 --> 25:01.338
He likes you.

25:01.940 --> 25:03.118
Pardon?

25:03.406 --> 25:05.309
I can tell by the way he looks at you.

25:05.613 --> 25:08.345
He's, uh, how we say... invested.

25:08.870 --> 25:10.580
I'm not really sure
what you mean by that,

25:10.614 --> 25:13.294
but to be clear: I am just a volunteer.

25:14.257 --> 25:15.689
And you seem like a nice girl,

25:16.386 --> 25:17.711
but do yourself a favor,

25:18.055 --> 25:19.591
don't get too comfortable.

25:20.023 --> 25:22.459
You make one mistake around Ray Carroll,

25:22.492 --> 25:24.361
he never lets you forget.

25:25.038 --> 25:26.830
(footsteps approach)

25:26.864 --> 25:30.182
You don't mind me stealing her
away for a minute, do you, Jud?

25:30.701 --> 25:32.278
Whatever you say, Ray.

25:34.830 --> 25:35.962
It's your night.

25:46.072 --> 25:48.073
We got this. Wait back here.

26:12.164 --> 26:14.400
DEA! Everybody on the ground!

26:14.433 --> 26:17.270
- DEA! On the ground!
- On the ground, now!

26:17.303 --> 26:18.303
- Hands!
- Right there!

26:18.337 --> 26:20.339
Just like that!

26:20.371 --> 26:21.440
Back, get back.

26:21.474 --> 26:23.341
Move away, move away!

26:23.374 --> 26:26.144
Don't move.

26:26.178 --> 26:27.847
Go ahead, start another.

26:34.186 --> 26:37.023
Code 4. Code 4, nothing here.

26:38.991 --> 26:40.216
What happened?

26:40.847 --> 26:42.980
Your informant sucks is what happened.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.281
Either he lied
or somebody knew we were coming.

26:45.313 --> 26:46.473
No, that's not possible.

26:46.506 --> 26:48.048
Yeah? Take a look around.

26:54.093 --> 26:56.429
(car approaches)

26:57.998 --> 26:59.266
That's him.

27:10.069 --> 27:11.605
What you want with Galvan?

27:11.637 --> 27:13.272
I need a face-to-face.

27:13.306 --> 27:15.242
He don't do appointments.

27:15.274 --> 27:18.311
What about Cesar Cruz? Ramon Delgado?

27:18.345 --> 27:20.165
How them names ringing out to you?

27:20.614 --> 27:23.150
Cesar... big homey's cousin, right?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.385
<i>Eso familia.</i>

27:24.717 --> 27:26.498
Well, I know who murked him out.

27:26.532 --> 27:28.015
And I know where to find him.

27:28.187 --> 27:29.032
Find who?

27:29.226 --> 27:31.896
Terry Bausch's goon. Guy named Dooley.

27:31.930 --> 27:35.468
Look, the rest I say to Galvan,
and Galvan only, you feel me?

27:39.971 --> 27:41.507
(grunting)

27:43.541 --> 27:45.543
(tires squealing)

27:49.708 --> 27:52.745
You come to my territory,
throw my name around.

27:52.777 --> 27:54.546
I don't even know you.

27:55.093 --> 27:57.552
And you expected... what?

27:57.586 --> 27:59.584
- Hmm?
- True.

28:00.085 --> 28:02.854
You're right. Respect.

28:03.533 --> 28:04.524
Look, I get who you are

28:04.556 --> 28:06.692
and I ain't trying
to come at you sideways, man.

28:06.726 --> 28:09.094
I-I ain't a part of your war.
And I ain't po-po,

28:09.128 --> 28:11.363
I'm just trying to tell you
what you need to know.

28:11.537 --> 28:13.099
Other than that, I'm nothing to you.

28:13.131 --> 28:14.801
Exactly,

28:14.833 --> 28:18.337
which is why it means nothing
if you die.

28:21.072 --> 28:23.109
You can't say the same thing for Dooley.

28:23.495 --> 28:26.078
He's hiding at a house
about 20 miles from here.

28:26.111 --> 28:27.426
Middle of nowhere.

28:27.459 --> 28:29.584
Got nobody with him...
no goons, nothing.

28:29.618 --> 28:31.784
How do I know I'm not
walking into anything, huh?

28:31.816 --> 28:33.118
Honestly, you don't.

28:33.151 --> 28:34.786
But y'all the ones with the guns.

28:35.144 --> 28:37.423
You believe what you want.
All I'm saying is

28:37.456 --> 28:39.805
- I want him dead just as much as you do.
- Why?

28:40.126 --> 28:41.694
'Cause he killed my homey.

28:41.726 --> 28:43.729
And I'm gonna pay him back for that.

28:48.534 --> 28:49.968
Take him to the house.

28:50.002 --> 28:51.738
If he's lying... (clicks tongue)

28:51.771 --> 28:52.853
...kill him.

28:52.886 --> 28:54.355
Hold on, like, now?

28:55.073 --> 28:58.111
I-I... I can't guarantee
that he's there right now.

28:58.143 --> 28:59.548

No.

30:17.110 --> 30:17.918

31:00.662 --> 31:01.849

31:02.255 --> 31:03.134
What?

31:03.631 --> 31:06.436
My name's Jermaine and
I'm one Jehovah's Witnesses,

31:06.468 --> 31:08.337

some good news, brother...

31:08.371 --> 31:10.305
- How did you get out here?
- Well, if this is a bad time,

31:10.339 --> 31:11.573
I can always come back another time.

31:11.607 --> 31:13.009
Get in the house.

31:14.509 --> 31:15.544

you was messing with, did you?

(moaning)

32:29.875 --> 32:31.276
Something you should know.

32:32.143 --> 32:35.131
The guy you shanked in prison,
his name was Boots.

32:36.492 --> 32:37.882
He was my best friend.

32:38.843 --> 32:40.931
Hundred times the man you ever were.

32:41.731 --> 32:42.832
Yeah.

32:43.235 --> 32:44.700
Now go ahead and die.

32:44.734 --> 32:45.914
(grunting)

32:54.888 --> 32:56.104
(crickets chirping)

33:00.716 --> 33:02.685
MARINA: Hi. Sorry.

33:02.717 --> 33:03.771
Is Jessie here?

33:04.719 --> 33:05.821
You a friend?

33:05.854 --> 33:07.756
Yeah, I'm Marina. Is she inside?

33:07.790 --> 33:09.781
No, but she'll be home soon.

33:09.814 --> 33:11.661
You're welcome to wait if you want.

33:12.261 --> 33:13.732
I could use the company.

33:14.696 --> 33:16.030
I'm her mama.

33:16.218 --> 33:17.200
Alice Ann.

33:17.747 --> 33:19.071
Sit, have a drink.

33:25.574 --> 33:27.880
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that.
- It's okay.

33:30.478 --> 33:32.521
Who's the lucky fella?

33:33.482 --> 33:34.688
I'm sorry?

33:34.890 --> 33:36.451
That rock on your finger.

33:37.179 --> 33:39.556
You gettin' married
or did the divorce go well?

33:40.689 --> 33:42.173
No. Um...

33:43.225 --> 33:44.990
Yeah, I'm engaged.

33:45.695 --> 33:47.990
To a lawyer. His name is Jackson Brooks.

33:48.831 --> 33:50.615
Jackson Brooks?

33:52.388 --> 33:54.131
Son of a bitch.

33:55.438 --> 33:56.708
You know him.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.369
He's a lawyer?

33:58.523 --> 34:00.089
Yeah. We both are.

34:00.437 --> 34:01.740
(scoffs)

34:01.960 --> 34:03.795
Well... (chuckles)

34:03.829 --> 34:05.729
that's a long way from Quitman.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.659
Quitman?

34:09.065 --> 34:10.635
Juvenile detention.

34:10.936 --> 34:13.458
Yeah. I, um... I know what it is.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.938
You didn't know he went there.

34:18.943 --> 34:21.050
(chuckles) Figures.

34:21.478 --> 34:22.944
You wouldn't have slid
that ring on your finger

34:22.969 --> 34:24.998
if you knew half the things I do.

34:28.152 --> 34:29.723
What things?

34:32.045 --> 34:34.248
(crickets chirping)

34:36.827 --> 34:38.676
Good God.

34:39.670 --> 34:40.587
I told you.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.699
You had it coming.

34:47.905 --> 34:48.942
Yeah, he did.

34:49.806 --> 34:51.755
And I made sure he knew it, too.

34:54.143 --> 34:55.442
(exhales)

34:55.887 --> 34:57.894
This is crazy.
We should probably get going.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.281
Yeah.

34:59.804 --> 35:01.673
Hey, you okay?

35:02.853 --> 35:04.386
How much you think that is?

35:08.353 --> 35:10.150
That's more than Boots made in a year.

35:12.076 --> 35:13.311
Reparations.

35:13.336 --> 35:14.678
Damn straight. Get it all.

35:14.703 --> 35:15.778
Come on.

35:16.667 --> 35:17.585
I got you.

35:18.363 --> 35:19.576
Twice.

35:23.949 --> 35:25.951
(dog barking in distance)

35:28.514 --> 35:29.840
Where the hell have you been?

35:30.194 --> 35:32.530
- That's funny. I could ask you the same thing.
- Well, I heard

35:32.564 --> 35:34.763
about what you did down at the
campaign. Are you kidding me?

35:34.788 --> 35:36.376
I went down there looking
for you, Jessie!

35:36.408 --> 35:37.936
You didn't tell me
you were gonna be in Austin

35:37.969 --> 35:39.044
with Ray Carroll, alone!

35:39.069 --> 35:40.614
Because I didn't know!

35:40.906 --> 35:41.993
It was last minute.

35:42.025 --> 35:44.307
All right, well, we talked
about this, and I told you

35:44.332 --> 35:45.960
I don't want you working there.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.993
Did we? Because I just remember

35:49.026 --> 35:50.808
you telling me what I can and can't do.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.234
Jessie, you don't understand.
I know this guy!

35:52.583 --> 35:54.922
Do you seriously think he's
not gonna find out who you are?!

35:54.956 --> 35:55.924
No, I don't.

35:55.958 --> 35:57.031
He's the warden!

35:58.059 --> 36:00.395
He finds out everything!

36:00.429 --> 36:02.965
And what happens when he does?

36:02.998 --> 36:05.181
What happens when I'm not there
to protect you?

36:05.381 --> 36:07.996
I get that you are trying
to protect me, okay?

36:08.070 --> 36:09.311
And I love you for that.

36:09.343 --> 36:11.302
But you can't tell me
everything that happened

36:11.336 --> 36:13.971
and then not let me
help you. It's not fair.

36:14.004 --> 36:16.265
- You think this is helping?
- Yes, I do.

36:16.525 --> 36:18.728
And I'm not gonna sit around
and do nothing.

36:23.418 --> 36:26.654
I'm-I'm on your side, Gil.

36:26.688 --> 36:28.693
So wh-why are you pushing me away?

36:31.783 --> 36:32.951
I love you, Jessie,

36:32.984 --> 36:34.465
but you have no idea
what I'm going through.

36:35.219 --> 36:36.654
How can you even say that?

36:36.687 --> 36:39.290
I have stood by you through all of this.

36:39.324 --> 36:40.859
You seriously don't think

36:40.891 --> 36:42.290
I understand what you're going through?

36:42.322 --> 36:44.141
If you understood, then you would stop.

36:45.715 --> 36:47.282
'Cause that's what I need.

36:47.316 --> 36:50.285
To not worry
about what he might do to you.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.980
If you don't get that,

36:53.005 --> 36:54.487
- then you don't understand me at all.
- Right.

36:54.512 --> 36:56.845
Because I never, ever have
to worry about you.

36:59.194 --> 37:00.547
- What is that?
- It's nothing.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.820
- Gil!
- I don't want to talk to you!

37:11.406 --> 37:13.410
(turns off engine)

37:23.451 --> 37:25.455
(exhales)

37:31.093 --> 37:32.954
BOOTS: <i>That was a hell of a party.</i>

37:33.714 --> 37:35.032
(Boots chuckles)

37:35.064 --> 37:37.135
Yeah, well, you know me. It's what I do.

37:41.337 --> 37:43.439
You know I've got to ask, right?

37:43.471 --> 37:45.535
Oh, man. It was just a
little Molly, all right?

37:45.841 --> 37:47.834
Nothin' to worry about.

37:49.004 --> 37:51.516
Well, it started off at Quitman
as nothing, too.

37:52.580 --> 37:54.171
Quitman was Quitman.

37:54.583 --> 37:55.821
That was about surviving.

37:56.819 --> 37:58.321
I ain't hurting nobody out here.

37:58.675 --> 38:00.442
Just doing a little something to get by.

38:02.758 --> 38:03.925
Maybe...

38:04.760 --> 38:06.729
maybe it's time to start thinking

38:06.761 --> 38:07.909
about more than just getting by.

38:08.763 --> 38:10.081
What, like you do?

38:10.872 --> 38:13.842
Settle for taking whatever crap
jobs just 'cause they're hiring?

38:13.896 --> 38:16.199
Settle for some girl
just 'cause she's there?

38:18.460 --> 38:21.069
Um, I didn't... I didn't
mean that. All right?

38:24.245 --> 38:26.846
Look, I'm not saying
that my way's the only way.

38:29.023 --> 38:30.378
But I love Annie.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.584
I'm lucky to have her.

38:34.162 --> 38:35.560
At some point,

38:37.459 --> 38:38.720
I just want you to have something

38:38.752 --> 38:39.984
that you can come home to.

38:42.043 --> 38:45.570
Something that stops you
from going to that place.

38:46.468 --> 38:47.179
What place?

38:47.212 --> 38:49.795
The place where you think
that you got nothing to lose.

38:50.485 --> 38:51.697
You want to go back to jail?

38:51.722 --> 38:53.902
Come on, Boots. Man, you know me.

38:54.207 --> 38:55.575
You know me better than that. I...

38:55.898 --> 38:57.260
never stepped into
something I can't handle.

38:57.285 --> 38:58.539
You're getting damn close.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.118
This comes easy to me, all right?

39:01.143 --> 39:02.984
That's just an excuse.

39:05.266 --> 39:06.876
You're not a drug dealer, Shawnie.

39:07.863 --> 39:08.922
Look at me.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.031
<i>Cut it out.</i>

39:28.873 --> 39:29.974
(alarm beeps, lock clicks)

39:30.007 --> 39:31.790
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:32.177 --> 39:34.662
- (door closes)
- So, listen, I've been thinkin'.

39:34.820 --> 39:36.354
I want to help out.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.543
What?

39:37.743 --> 39:39.912
I know Boots would've wanted
you to be happy and safe,

39:39.937 --> 39:41.973
so... (exhales)

39:42.581 --> 39:44.483
I'm helping out.

39:44.903 --> 39:47.642
Don't know exactly how yet but...

39:49.049 --> 39:50.445
you don't have to sell.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.126
This is your home.

39:55.446 --> 39:57.149
MARINA: <i>Nothing more that you
want to add to that?</i>

39:57.174 --> 39:59.009
JACKSON: <i>I am telling you everything.</i>

39:59.236 --> 40:00.972
I was 14 when we were sentenced.

40:00.997 --> 40:02.566
We each got nine months,

40:02.591 --> 40:04.497
we did our time,
and then we got out. That is it.

40:04.745 --> 40:06.991
All right? What-what else
do you want to know?

40:07.016 --> 40:08.763
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
- Because it was

40:08.788 --> 40:11.257
25 years ago. That...
Because that has nothing

40:11.282 --> 40:13.418
- to do with who I am today!
- Well, how would I know?!

40:14.445 --> 40:17.750
Do you know how stupid I felt
hearing this for the first time

40:17.775 --> 40:19.641
- from a complete stranger?
- Screw Alice Ann.

40:19.666 --> 40:21.135
- She's just a drunk!
- Who knows

40:21.160 --> 40:22.995
more about you than I do!

40:23.121 --> 40:25.059
Why don't we just add her
to the list, huh?

40:25.084 --> 40:26.679
- Marina...
- No, I mean it. When we were

40:26.704 --> 40:28.570
in Brennan,
everybody knew except me, right?

40:28.920 --> 40:31.023
"Poor Marina.
But we can't tell her the truth,

40:31.048 --> 40:32.751
because she's not one of us."

40:32.776 --> 40:35.329
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I don't walk around

40:35.354 --> 40:38.006
- just telling people about...
- I am not people!

40:38.031 --> 40:40.644
I am gonna be your wife, for God's sake!

40:41.432 --> 40:44.341
So what else are you keeping from me?!

40:45.726 --> 40:46.854
Nothing.

40:48.305 --> 40:49.423
Yeah?

41:00.318 --> 41:03.014
10:17, two nights ago.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.423
I was at the office, and you
said that you turned in early.

41:06.457 --> 41:09.027
So why didn't you tell
me that she came here?

41:09.059 --> 41:11.361
She just... she wanted to talk.

41:11.394 --> 41:12.466
About what?

41:12.930 --> 41:15.300
About... nothing.

41:16.050 --> 41:17.267
About... stupid

41:17.300 --> 41:19.136
childhood stuff. It's-it's...

41:19.169 --> 41:21.138
This is... not a big deal.

41:21.171 --> 41:22.475
You need to get out.

41:25.276 --> 41:26.822
Wh-What?

41:27.085 --> 41:29.041
I am done with the fighting!

41:29.066 --> 41:31.895
I am done with this lying!

41:32.843 --> 41:34.612
- Okay, Marina, don't...
- I deserve the truth,

41:34.711 --> 41:37.514
and until you can give that
to me, we can't be together.

41:39.019 --> 41:39.980
M-Marina...

41:40.011 --> 41:42.623
Just get out!
