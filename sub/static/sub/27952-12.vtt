he thinks Schneider fell off the wagon.

You know, my cousin Miguel
fell off the wagon once.

00:29.487 --> 00:32.032
And he rolled down a hill
into a cave of bats

00:32.115 --> 00:34.200

00:34.284 --> 00:36.953

-Mami, this is serious.
-Okay.

-Well, what are the signs?
-Not showing up for work.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.261
So he has been drunk
for the last 20 years?

is another sign.

he will be a hungover mess today.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.215
Oh, my God.

I'm fine. Addicts always think
everyone's an addict,

12:30.499 --> 12:32.084
and I know she'll love.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.420
It's perfect.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.589
Oh, I...

12:36.672 --> 12:39.175
I can't let you see it.
It has to be a surprise.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.011
Great. Because I don't care.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.514
I just want my phone back.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.391
Oh.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.476
Thank you.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.280
Okay, let us know if you hear from him.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.158
You're the person
he's most likely to call in a crisis.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.118
Okay, thank you. Bye.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.205
Avery hasn't seen him?

13:09.288 --> 13:10.623
That was his almond milker.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.752
But Avery hasn't seen him, either.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.045
She says they broke up.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.798
iAi, que triste!

13:19.840 --> 13:23.594
Well, I-I-I checked with
all our neighbors. Nada.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.595
[door opening]

13:24.678 --> 13:27.723
Mami, that's the kids. Don't say anything.
I don't want them to get freaked out.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.808
Okay.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.102
So?

13:32.186 --> 13:35.231
What has two thumbs
and a provisional driver's license

13:35.314 --> 13:38.025
to be used only between the times
of 5:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.860
with no passengers under the age of 20

13:39.944 --> 13:43.030
without a licensed driver
aged 25 or higher present?

13:43.113 --> 13:44.782
This guy!

13:44.865 --> 13:46.867
[laughter]

13:48.118 --> 13:51.497
Yay. Congratulations.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.833
I am so proud of you.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.169
It was pretty intense. I actually
started to have an anxiety attack,

13:57.253 --> 13:59.171
but Alex helped me through it.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.256
Really?

14:00.339 --> 14:03.592
It was nothing. I knew what to do
because of everything we talked about.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.845
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Ah, sorry.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.265
My phone's blowing up with crying girls
who didn't get their licenses.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.227
Wait. How are they gonna get to me?

14:14.603 --> 14:17.106
No! I didn't think this through.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.984
Don't worry. I will find you an Uber.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.027
Elena, your name is now Uber.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.033
So much to celebrate.

14:28.951 --> 14:29.869
Sparkling cider?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.745
Yep, and I sprung for the good stuff.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.372
Ahh. Martinelli's?

14:33.455 --> 14:36.208
Ooh, we're gonna party
like slightly rebellious Mormons.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.253
Thank you, Alex.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.715
I knew you would pass.
Why do you think it's chilled?

14:43.924 --> 14:48.846
[grunts] Alex. No, I really couldn't have
done this without you.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.015
You were there for me and-- Ow!

14:51.098 --> 14:52.433
Oh, my God!

14:52.516 --> 14:54.018
Oh, don't worry. It's okay.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.770
No, my shirt!
I need to wash it before it stains.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.529
[man] Ow!

15:06.989 --> 15:07.823
[groans]

15:10.534 --> 15:11.744
Schneider?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.372
Alex, hey, man.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.543
Are you doing a load? 'Cause...

15:20.794 --> 15:22.963
I think I threw up on my pants.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
Oh.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.927
Dude, what happened?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.095
Uh...

15:31.722 --> 15:35.017
I think I ate something
that didn't agree with me.

15:39.855 --> 15:40.981
Are you drunk?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.483
What? No.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.862
-I thought you quit a long time ago.
-[sighs]

15:48.822 --> 15:53.077
Yeah, well, I recently... quit quitting.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.667
It's all right. I'm just gonna...

16:00.876 --> 16:02.086
go upstairs...

16:03.003 --> 16:05.339
take a hot shower,
and I'll be good as new.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.261
Are you sure you're okay?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.724
-I think we should call somebody.
-No!

16:22.731 --> 16:24.692
I'm sorry. I just...

16:25.317 --> 16:26.527
It's not a big deal.

16:27.736 --> 16:32.366
It's not gonna happen again, so don't
tell your mom you found me down here.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.369
Come on!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.417
She's just gonna freak out and overreact

16:41.500 --> 16:44.128
like she did with you
'cause you smoked a little weed.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.213
How long did she ground you for?

16:48.549 --> 16:49.800
Four months and counting.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.637
So you get it?

16:55.347 --> 16:56.348
Yeah.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
I do.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.063
You did the right thing calling us.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.693
Here, Schneider,
I made you sopa de pollo.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.321
And, uh, I got you a wet towel
for your head.

17:11.947 --> 17:15.576
I don't know if it actually works.
They just always did it on Nurse Jackie.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.539
Thanks, guys.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.750
[sighs]

17:22.833 --> 17:27.296
They say while you're staying sober,
your disease is doing push-ups.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.300
Thought I could drink like I used to,
but, uh...

17:33.218 --> 17:34.762
guess I'm out of practice.

17:37.431 --> 17:41.101
We love you.
And you're gonna get through this.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.647
Thank you.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.735
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and try to clean up.

17:49.818 --> 17:53.113
Okay, Schneider, but you need a hug.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.116
Heh heh.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.663
Okay, he's clean.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.171
Alex, I, uh...

18:09.254 --> 18:10.255
It's all good.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.555
-Come here. I wanna talk to you.
-[door closes]

18:21.016 --> 18:24.186
Mom, I get it.
Cautionary tale. Scared straight.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.188
No, that's not what I wanted to say.

18:26.271 --> 18:30.109
I am really proud
of how you handled everything today.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.570
You helped Elena
through an anxiety attack.

18:34.238 --> 18:38.867
Dr. Berkowitz called me and said
you helped solve his biggest problem.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.495
I couldn't even narrow that down.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.500
Plus Schneider.

18:48.043 --> 18:51.839
It takes a mature kid to know what to do
when faced with something like that.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.674
I guess I just realized he needed help

18:53.757 --> 18:56.802
more than he needed someone
to keep his secret.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.011
Well, you were right.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.724
And that's why, as of...

19:04.601 --> 19:06.228
ironically, 4:20...

19:06.311 --> 19:07.396
[chuckles]

19:10.524 --> 19:13.861
you are officially ungrounded.

19:13.944 --> 19:14.987
Really?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.655
-Yeah.
-Yes!

19:20.617 --> 19:23.328
Now go out, have some fun...

19:24.163 --> 19:27.124
and in an added plot twist...

19:27.207 --> 19:28.667
ba-bam!

19:29.251 --> 19:31.837
Whoa. A twenty-dollar bill?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.715
I saw these in a rap video once.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.137
Thanks, Mom.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.725
Hey, Uber, bring the car around.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.022
I can't drive you unless we have someone
25 or older in the car.

19:50.105 --> 19:53.233
You're in luck. I just squeaked by.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.450
-[door closes]
-[door opens]

20:02.034 --> 20:04.369
Thanks, you guys, for the soup
and for understanding--

20:04.453 --> 20:06.121
They're gone, so enough of the b.s.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.584
My son has to find you passed out
in a laundry room?

20:11.752 --> 20:15.923
How long has this been going on?
And tell me the fricking truth this time.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.346
It actually did start
when my dad was here.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.768
You been lying to us for that long?
What the hell, Schneider?

20:27.851 --> 20:28.852
I know.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.898
It's just... ahh.

20:33.398 --> 20:37.986
Seeing him again reminded me of how
he always said I was bad at everything.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.280
But it's not true.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.951
I was really good at one thing--

20:44.034 --> 20:45.035
drinking.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.956
I could always drink
way more than everybody else.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.042
It made me interesting...

20:53.043 --> 20:54.044
and fun.

20:56.338 --> 21:00.050
And when he was here, I had one drink.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.428
And I actually managed to stand up to him.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.768
So I started thinking,
"Why does it have to be all or nothing?

21:09.851 --> 21:11.520
I can handle a drink now and then."

21:15.732 --> 21:17.234
But obviously, I can't.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.488
What are you doing?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.659
I'm removing my eight-year chip.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.829
I don't deserve to be
in the Alvarez Museum anymore.

21:28.912 --> 21:29.913
I blew it.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.500
You're never gonna trust me again.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.212
You know the first time...

21:38.213 --> 21:40.716
you asked me to take Alex
to his baseball game

21:42.634 --> 21:44.970
was one of the proudest moments
of my life.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.142
Nobody ever asks the addict
to do that kind of stuff.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.854
But you did.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.902
You're the only one
who's ever trusted me, Pen.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.533
All that goes away now.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.953
It doesn't go away.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.790
It's just gonna be hard to get back.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.505
Eight years.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.341
Gone.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.306
And now the thought
of going back to a meeting...

22:30.932 --> 22:32.392
and starting over?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.936
I can't do it.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.189
Yes, of course you can.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.150
And you will.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.988
I'm not giving up on you.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.907
None of us are.

22:48.867 --> 22:52.662
If you don't start going back to meetings,
you're just gonna keep slipping.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.708
You want to be a good role model
for the kids, right?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.211
This is your chance.

23:04.216 --> 23:09.054
Someone once told me,
"Don't quit before the miracle happens."

23:11.515 --> 23:13.934
That's pretty smart. Who said that?

23:14.017 --> 23:16.353
Ha ha. You did, dummy.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.486
I just don't know
if I can face those guys.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.284
You don't have to do that alone.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.798
Hi. My name is Pat,

23:44.881 --> 23:47.759
and... I'm an alcoholic.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.261
-Hey, Pat.
-Hi, Pat.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.973
Today is day one for me.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.061
[mouths]

23:59.896 --> 24:01.648
Okay, 10-minute break.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.944
-I'm glad you're back, dude.
-Thanks, man.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.446
I'm always here for you,

24:07.529 --> 24:09.865
even if I'm putting up
500 pounds on the bench

24:09.948 --> 24:11.575
or out with some model

24:11.658 --> 24:15.454
or on my yacht
playing D&amp;D with the homies.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.249
But next time, call your sponsor.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.461
Before.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.008
Yeah. And I might call you, too.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.888
For other reasons.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.434
[closing theme music playing]
