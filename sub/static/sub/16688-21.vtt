00:11.200 --> 00:13.600
( Wind whistling )

00:17.320 --> 00:19.100
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

00:19.200 --> 00:20.700
Nice! Customers!

00:20.800 --> 00:22.540
Can I help you?!
No!
<i>Iwant to help you!</i>

00:22.640 --> 00:24.340
Guys, guys,
it's <i>myturn.</i>

00:24.440 --> 00:26.900
What are you looking for?
Action? Comedy? Action comedy?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.460
Sorry, we actually don't know
what we're looking for,

00:29.560 --> 00:31.580
but this map
that Mary Stone gave us

00:31.680 --> 00:34.580
says that whatever it is,
it's somewhere in this store.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.140
It's gonna be
a little hard to know

00:36.240 --> 00:38.240
what kind of action comedy
to recommend

00:37.960 --> 00:39.960
if you don't know
what you're looking for.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.220
( All gasp )

00:41.320 --> 00:42.220
The Chosen One.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.640
The Chosen One?
Where?

00:47.200 --> 00:48.620
Oh, my.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.720
We have something
to show you.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.220
Duh!
What are they doing?

00:56.320 --> 00:58.020
They're gonna put Pops' head
in that hole

00:58.120 --> 00:59.220
to open a secret door.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.320
It's pretty obvious,
Benson.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.860
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:06.960 --> 01:07.860
Told you!

01:07.960 --> 01:09.820
What's behind
the door?

01:09.920 --> 01:11.920
Key to your past.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.180
It's...for me.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.500
It's probably
a sweet Pops origin story.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.380
Maybe it'll tell us
what we're supposed to do next.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.020
Plus, that tape's made
out of ice!

01:26.120 --> 01:28.120
We totally
gotta watch it!

01:27.360 --> 01:28.940
Can we use
one of your VCRs upstairs?

01:29.040 --> 01:31.260
The tape won't work
in any normal VCR.

01:31.360 --> 01:34.340
You must take the tape
to the Forbidden Mountain.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.740
There, and only there,

01:35.840 --> 01:37.760
may the contents of the tape
be revealed to you.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.220
It'll be
pretty dangerous,

01:39.320 --> 01:41.320
but we'll gladly die
to make sure you get there

01:41.200 --> 01:42.220
to watch that tape.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.180
Not sure
that will be necessary.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.280
Let's roll.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.620
All this Pops "Chosen One" stuff
is crazy!

01:52.720 --> 01:54.720
I mean, I always thought
he was just an old guy.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.680
A <i>niceold guy,</i>
but, you know?

01:55.960 --> 01:58.020
Yeah. I wonder
what he <i>reallyis.</i>

01:58.120 --> 02:00.500
Like, what if Pops
isn't Pops at all!

02:00.600 --> 02:03.180
What if
Pops is a robot?!

02:03.280 --> 02:06.560
Oh! Or what if he's actually
a smaller guy <i>pilotinga robot?</i>

02:09.320 --> 02:11.320
Yeah,
that sounds about right.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.180
We're almost to the mountain,
but to get there,

02:14.280 --> 02:16.280
we must first cross
this frozen lake.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.220
That looks pretty dangerous.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.780
Is there another way?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.780
Well, sure ââ if you wanna
go through Magma Lake

02:22.880 --> 02:24.420
or Lightning Lake,
be my guest.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.340
Those names
feel pretty on the nose.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.220
All right. Guess we'll go across
the frozen lake.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.540
That's what I thought.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.640
We must make haste ââ
<i>carefulhaste.</i>

02:39.200 --> 02:41.200
Uh...guys?

02:42.560 --> 02:43.740
Ditch the snowmobiles!

02:43.840 --> 02:44.740
Run!

02:44.840 --> 02:46.840
( All panting )

02:49.880 --> 02:51.420
( Gasps )

02:51.520 --> 02:52.740
I'm not gonna make it!

02:52.840 --> 02:53.940
( Grunts )

02:54.040 --> 02:55.980
No, Joel!

02:56.080 --> 02:57.260
It's too late for me!

02:57.360 --> 02:58.500
Rigby:
Just jump it!

02:58.600 --> 03:00.260
Eileen: I really think
you can make it!

03:00.360 --> 03:02.580
Uh...I'm not much
of a jumper.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.260
You sure you don't wanna
at least try?

03:04.360 --> 03:07.460
Well, uh...I could...
give it a try.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.540
Whoa!

03:08.640 --> 03:10.780
Oh, man!
I forgot to jump!

03:10.880 --> 03:11.900
Joel!

03:12.000 --> 03:14.580
Now I'm for sure a goner!
Just go!

03:14.680 --> 03:17.380
Maybe we could make
a human chain and pull you out?

03:17.480 --> 03:19.260
But you guys'll be
really cold!

03:19.360 --> 03:21.220
It really won't be
that bad!

03:21.320 --> 03:22.180
( Whimpers )

03:22.280 --> 03:23.900
Okay, that sounds good!

03:24.000 --> 03:25.180
LâLet's try that!

03:25.280 --> 03:26.740
Aah!

03:26.840 --> 03:28.180
Well...we tried.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.280
Let's keep moving.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.700
It was very brave
of...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.500
JâJoel?
Joel.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.300
...Joel to sacrifice himself
like that.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.980
What do you think
is on that tape?

03:43.080 --> 03:46.060
I have no idea,
but I'm eager to find out.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.980
I know so little about myself,
about my past.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.180
I can't even remember anything
from before I was 2 years old.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.900
Uh, <i>nobodycan remember</i>
that far back, Pops.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.500
Yeah, 2?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.780
I can hardly remember anything
before I was <i>22.</i>

03:59.880 --> 04:01.880
Perhaps you're right.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.040
( Doorbell rings )

04:07.480 --> 04:09.840
Skips:
Hey! Take a look at this!

04:12.760 --> 04:13.900
It's bones.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.820
UâUâUh...I don't think
we should stay here.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.860
Agreed. This is definitely
a snow mammoth's den.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.960
And from the looks
of it...

04:20.000 --> 04:21.300
( Roars )

04:21.400 --> 04:22.380
He's right there!

04:22.480 --> 04:24.260
Everyone, run!

04:24.360 --> 04:26.500
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Over here!

04:26.600 --> 04:27.540
Go get it!

04:27.640 --> 04:28.420
( Roars )

04:28.520 --> 04:29.460
Aah!

04:29.560 --> 04:30.500
( Scream echoes )

04:30.600 --> 04:32.420
Fi! No!

04:32.520 --> 04:35.020
I'm not worth it!
Go on without me!

04:35.120 --> 04:37.260
You should really have
some more selfârespect!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.540
You deserve to live
as much as any of us!

04:39.640 --> 04:41.620
You know...
maybe you're right!

04:41.720 --> 04:43.780
Oh, no!
Now it's really too late!

04:43.880 --> 04:45.700
Fi! No!!

04:45.800 --> 04:48.180
There's a hole over here
we can go through!

04:48.280 --> 04:50.280
Don't let her death
be in vain.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.520
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

04:55.120 --> 04:55.940
Aaaah!

04:56.040 --> 04:56.900
Aaaah!

04:57.000 --> 04:57.780
Aaaah!

04:57.880 --> 05:01.000
( Laughing )

05:03.040 --> 05:05.120
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

05:06.120 --> 05:08.260
Greetings, travelers.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.820
Mordecai: Aw, what!
The Eggscellent Knight?

05:10.920 --> 05:12.220
How are <i>youup here?!</i>

05:12.320 --> 05:13.660
Yeah, we're not even
on Earth!

05:13.760 --> 05:16.540
I posted my rÃ©sumÃ©
on one of those job websites,

05:16.640 --> 05:19.260
and bingo ââ
I got some relic guarding work

05:19.360 --> 05:21.180
outside
the Andromeda Galaxy.

05:21.280 --> 05:25.540
Anyways, I'm here to tell you
of these three VCRs.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.900
One of fire...one of ice...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.540
one that's seemingly normal.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.820
Choose incorrectly,

05:31.920 --> 05:34.800
and the information
will be lost forever!

05:36.240 --> 05:37.740
So, which one
do we choose?

05:37.840 --> 05:41.000
Well, that seemingly
normal one's definitely a trap.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.520
( Gun cocks )

05:45.920 --> 05:47.860
I can't say.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.780
I don't know ââ
ice tape, ice VCR?

05:49.880 --> 05:50.980
Am I crazy here?

05:51.080 --> 05:52.380
Makes sense to me.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.480
What do <i>yousay, Pops?</i>

05:57.600 --> 06:00.100
( Doorbell rings )

06:00.200 --> 06:01.620
Delivery
for Mr. Maellard, see.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.540
Careful, sir.
It seems to be quite hot, see.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.140
Don't tell me how to handle

06:05.240 --> 06:07.220
my highly futuristic
equipment, see!

06:07.320 --> 06:08.340
Whatever you say, see.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.900
Say, is this thing
made well?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.860
I need it to last
a while, see.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.880
Well, sir, you could upgrade
to a lifetime warranty

06:13.960 --> 06:15.060
for 25 cents, see.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.700
Sounds like a scam, see.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.380
Get outta my house,
ya crook!

06:18.480 --> 06:19.420
( Door slams )

06:19.520 --> 06:21.380
( Gasps )
It's the fire one!

06:21.480 --> 06:23.780
Really?
Won't it just melt
if we put it in there?

06:23.880 --> 06:25.420
And then we'd never know
what's on it!

06:25.520 --> 06:27.520
You won't be able to learn
about your destiny!

06:27.440 --> 06:29.260
Just trust me.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.360
Good luck, Chosen One.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.060
( Crashing )
( Roars )

06:35.160 --> 06:36.220
( All screaming )

06:36.320 --> 06:38.320
Hold it off!
Pops must see the tape!

06:39.080 --> 06:40.580
( Growls )

06:40.680 --> 06:42.800
It's just making the place
smell like burnt wigs!

06:44.000 --> 06:47.160
It's all we got!
Keep shooting!

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
( Roars )
( All gasp )

06:54.000 --> 06:55.260
No!

06:55.360 --> 06:58.340
We didn't come this far
to not get answers!

06:58.440 --> 07:00.840
( Grunting, groaning )

07:08.760 --> 07:10.780
I got it!

07:10.880 --> 07:12.220
Aah!

07:12.320 --> 07:14.020
( Laser fire )

07:14.120 --> 07:15.420
For Pops!

07:15.520 --> 07:16.380
( Panting )

07:16.480 --> 07:18.740
Kai! No!!

07:18.840 --> 07:20.840
We could just
keep shooting rocks at him!

07:20.280 --> 07:21.860
It was working
really well!

07:21.960 --> 07:22.940
( Grunts ) What?

07:23.040 --> 07:23.980
( Gasps )

07:24.080 --> 07:27.000
( Both screaming )

07:28.080 --> 07:29.700
( Cellphone rings )
Hello?

07:29.800 --> 07:31.340
I knew my time
would come!

07:31.440 --> 07:33.740
And it was totally worth it
to die for Pops!

07:33.840 --> 07:37.020
I gotta goooooooooo!

07:37.120 --> 07:39.100
Kai? Kai? Hello?

07:39.200 --> 07:40.540
She said
it was worth it.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.060
Those three.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.060
If nothing else,
they had a calling.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.660
Ahem.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.880
It is time
to make your choice.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.480
Oooh!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Oooh!

07:53.760 --> 07:56.180
You have chosen wisely.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.020
<i>You did it, Pops!</i>
<i>You found the tape!</i>

07:59.120 --> 08:00.340
All: Mr. Maellard?

08:00.440 --> 08:01.420
Poppa?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.380
<i>I couldn't be more proud.</i>

08:03.480 --> 08:05.060
<i>Now, I think it's high time</i>

08:05.160 --> 08:06.980
<i>that I explain some things</i>
<i>to you.</i>

08:07.080 --> 08:09.580
<i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>I was on an expedition</i>

08:09.680 --> 08:11.500
<i>for recently fallen meteorites.</i>

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
<i>People at the time</i>
<i>liked the look of them,</i>

08:13.200 --> 08:14.620
<i>so they'd pay a pretty penny.</i>

08:14.720 --> 08:18.660
<i>Then, one day,</i>
<i>a brandânew meteor fell.</i>

08:18.760 --> 08:20.740
<i>It was my lucky day!</i>

08:20.840 --> 08:24.200
<i>But when we went to inspect it,</i>
<i>we found something else.</i>

08:25.120 --> 08:26.300
<i>It was you!</i>

08:26.400 --> 08:28.220
<i>Baby you, but you!</i>

08:28.320 --> 08:30.140
<i>My Pops.</i>

08:30.240 --> 08:32.860
<i>I called you that 'cause you</i>
<i>looked superâold. ( Chuckles )</i>

08:32.960 --> 08:35.740
<i>But then...</i>
<i>I found something else.</i>

08:35.840 --> 08:38.900
<i>With you, I found a scroll.</i>

08:39.000 --> 08:41.620
<i>The scroll explained</i>
<i>that you are special,</i>

08:41.720 --> 08:43.500
<i>not of this Earth.</i>

08:43.600 --> 08:45.420
<i>It told the tale</i>
<i>of two brothers ââ</i>

08:45.520 --> 08:48.140
<i>one, the embodiment</i>
<i>of pure good</i>

08:48.240 --> 08:51.300
<i>and the other,</i>
<i>filled with pure evil,</i>

08:51.400 --> 08:53.900
<i>destined to be at war</i>
<i>with one another.</i>

08:54.000 --> 08:56.740
<i>I hoped I'd found the good one.</i>
<i>( Laughs )</i>

08:56.840 --> 08:58.060
<i>I hate returning things.</i>

08:58.160 --> 08:59.740
<i>So I decided to hide you</i>

08:59.840 --> 09:03.420
<i>in the most ordinary place</i>
<i>I could find.</i>

09:03.520 --> 09:05.520
<i>All I wanted</i>
<i>is for you to live out</i>

09:05.040 --> 09:07.180
<i>the rest of your days</i>
<i>safely on Earth</i>

09:07.280 --> 09:09.460
<i>but that isn't your destiny.</i>

09:09.560 --> 09:12.580
<i>The universe</i>
<i>is beginning to unravel.</i>

09:12.680 --> 09:16.140
<i>And it can only be the work</i>
<i>of that brother of yours,</i>

09:16.240 --> 09:20.140
<i>out there somewhere,</i>
<i>his instinct, only to destroy.</i>

09:20.240 --> 09:23.420
<i>You, Pops,</i>
<i>have the power to stop him.</i>

09:23.520 --> 09:26.060
<i>You're the only thing</i>
<i>standing between him</i>

09:26.160 --> 09:28.620
<i>and the destruction</i>
<i>of the universe!</i>

09:28.720 --> 09:30.820
<i>Pops, I'm sure by now</i>

09:30.920 --> 09:34.020
<i>you've started to notice</i>
<i>your body's changing.</i>

09:34.120 --> 09:37.780
<i>You're finding powers where</i>
<i>there were no powers before.</i>

09:37.880 --> 09:40.100
<i>These are</i>
<i>the beginning manifestations</i>

09:40.200 --> 09:41.980
<i>of your true form.</i>

09:42.080 --> 09:44.580
<i>You must learn</i>
<i>to harness your powers</i>

09:44.680 --> 09:45.980
<i>if you are to survive.</i>

09:46.080 --> 09:48.740
<i>The scroll</i>
<i>speaks of the strongest,</i>

09:48.840 --> 09:52.180
<i>most powerful trainer ââ Earl,</i>

09:52.280 --> 09:55.180
<i>who will teach you</i>
<i>how to use your powers.</i>

09:55.280 --> 09:59.100
<i>I know it's a lot to take in,</i>
<i>but I believe in you.</i>

09:59.200 --> 10:02.380
<i>And, Pops...</i>
<i>I may not be your real father,</i>

10:02.480 --> 10:06.260
<i>but you were always</i>
<i>my real son.</i>

10:06.360 --> 10:08.600
<i>Should we do another one?</i>
<i>Did we get that?</i>

10:13.480 --> 10:15.460
Ohhhhhh, boy.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.740
Guess Pops isn't a robot.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.540
So...how do we
find this trainer?

10:19.640 --> 10:22.040
Looking for me?

10:23.400 --> 10:24.380
Uhh?
Uhh?
Uhh?
Uhh?

10:24.480 --> 10:27.140
I am Earl ââ
from the tape.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.940
Now,
who's ready to train?

10:30.040 --> 10:32.040
Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhh!

10:31.040 --> 10:33.640
Yes, of course!
He's old!
