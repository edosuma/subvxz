ain't nobody gonna give no roster spot
to no fool with no green elf shoes on.

00:07.530 --> 00:09.680
What are the chances of another
heart becoming available?

00:09.810 --> 00:11.210
This time when it goes off,call uS.

00:11.310 --> 00:14.040
I'm taking that last
shot,or I'm taking a seat.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.900
Take a seat.

00:16.030 --> 00:18.220
Child services keeps
showing up,looking for me.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.530
I probably won't see you for a while.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.170
I never had a letterman jacket.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.330
Now you do.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.870
I want you to have thiS.

00:24.930 --> 00:26.890
It means we're going steady.

00:26.940 --> 00:31.180
I want a director who can make
the little thingsthe big things

00:31.250 --> 00:33.200
and you are just not the guy to do that.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.140
Pick one -- if you don't,I'm
gonna choose your director for yoU.

00:37.260 --> 00:38.700
Appreciate you meeting me.

00:38.780 --> 00:39.710
What do you want,reese?

00:39.780 --> 00:41.630
I'm directing the movie.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.020

You can work your whole "I'm

00:52.800 --> 00:55.940
- scoring my touchdowns" on somebody
else,because -- I don't even play football.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.630
Whatever -- the point is,at the end
of the day,all your bluster and B.S.

00:59.720 --> 01:04.440
Don't mean anything to math,because
math don't care,and neither do I.

01:04.510 --> 01:05.830
Well,does english care?

01:05.950 --> 01:08.050
'Cause I pretty much suck at that,too.

01:12.220 --> 01:13.570
I like her ponchO.

01:13.660 --> 01:15.470
Why am I shirtless?

01:15.660 --> 01:18.560
Yeah,let's do one where he wears
a poncho and she's shirtless.

01:23.390 --> 01:24.680
He was kidd...

01:24.790 --> 01:26.430
You guys were great.Thank yoU.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.160
so,what'd you guys think?

01:30.240 --> 01:33.680
Reese: Really?Didn't realize julian had
given creative control to all four of uS.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.710
They're the real people.Don't you
think their opinions may be valuable?

01:38.860 --> 01:40.290
They seemed fine.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.600
Yeah.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.720
I stand corrected.Let's get the
studio on the phone right now.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.800
Tell them we found two
actors who seem fine.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.930
Why don't you tell them their
director's a jackass while you're at it?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.430
Okay,we should go,and I will stop
by later toee how you're doing.

01:55.410 --> 01:59.130
You know,even when he talks back
to me,I still find him likable.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.840
All right,lose the shirt,buddY.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.789
The simple things in life are
not small always and forever.

02:12.510 --> 02:14.160
It sucks I can't stick around for thiS.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.910
It sucks even more you're
gonna be gone for two weeks.

02:18.230 --> 02:20.930
At least I'll have all these
shirtless nathans to keep me company.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.860

02:50.320 --> 02:52.510
Were you allowed to date in prison?

02:54.070 --> 02:57.500
Some people did.I opted not to.Why?

02:57.700 --> 02:59.520
Well,there's a girl at school -

02:59.600 --> 03:00.930
- oh,you like her?
- No.

03:01.030 --> 03:01.860
- Yes,you do.
- no

03:01.940 --> 03:02.790
You like her a lot.

03:02.860 --> 03:04.910
No,no.No,no,no,no,no.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.590
Anyway,I was wondering if maybe I could
invite her over to your beach house someday.

03:09.670 --> 03:10.830
Sure.

03:10.910 --> 03:12.710
Why not today?I'll
clear it with your mom.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.000
Well,I never asked a
girl over to play before.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.410
What do I say?

03:16.470 --> 03:19.670
Well,lucky for you,women have never
been able to turn a scott man down.

03:19.740 --> 03:24.640
So you just flash your million-dollar smile,say a few
nice words,and pfft -- it's like putty in your handS.

03:25.820 --> 03:27.440
Yeah,that's the one.

03:27.530 --> 03:29.580
Just smile and say something nice?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.260
That really works?

03:31.360 --> 03:32.810
Every time.

03:37.030 --> 03:38.530
What are you smiling about?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.570
I-I can't help it.That was amazing.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.410
No wonder you were so
popular in high school.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.240
Excuse me?

03:44.310 --> 03:45.920
Sex did not make me popular.

03:46.010 --> 03:47.830
I made it popular.

03:48.580 --> 03:51.900
Well,either way,I'm just happy to
be a part of that crowd for a change.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.190
Please.

03:53.250 --> 03:57.920
With this face,you were
probably mr.Popular.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.850
You might be surprised.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.310
Anyway,I wish I could stay,but
I'm already late for castinG.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.780
For which character?

04:05.920 --> 04:07.370
Don't
-- oh!

04:16.620 --> 04:17.589
peyton sawyer?

04:17.660 --> 04:18.870
Yeah.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.899
Go have a seat with the other peytons,and
we'll call you when it's your turn.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.870
Oh,no,no,no.I'm sorry.You
don't understand.

04:23.950 --> 04:26.160
I -- i am
peyton sawyer.

04:26.250 --> 04:30.750
I really appreciate your confidence,but
you still have to wait your turn.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.860
What's your name?

04:33.980 --> 04:36.030
Peyton sawyeR.

04:36.350 --> 04:38.380
Actresses.

04:48.390 --> 04:51.450
why do people always leave?

04:52.120 --> 04:54.280
Oh,god.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.910
I'm here to read for the
part of peyton first of all

05:01.000 --> 05:04.790
,you don't know m second
of all,you don't know me.

05:04.890 --> 05:07.380
God,why are guys such jerks?

05:09.220 --> 05:11.940
Too old,but she would make a great deb.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.450
she's the real peyton.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.490
Did you come to watch?

05:21.640 --> 05:22.450
No.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.930
The baby-proofer's coming to the house,and
ve got to go register for our wedding

05:26.010 --> 05:30.240
and baby gifts,and your mother sent us a
crib,but the instructions are all in italian.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.400
You're stewed,buttwad.

05:34.050 --> 05:35.720
"Weird science.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.620
" I really wish I could
help,but I'm kind of slammed.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.470
No,it's okay.

05:40.530 --> 05:42.770
I just came by to wish you good
luck and to bring you lunch.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.490
Why are you so good to me?

05:44.560 --> 05:45.330
I don't know.

05:45.380 --> 05:50.120
Maybe because I am a riddle
wrapped in a mystery inside a bitch.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.230
What woman isn't?

05:57.650 --> 05:59.390
Bye.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.510
You wanted to see me?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.880
Yes.Take a seat,pleasE.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.470
Do you know why I called you here?

06:11.570 --> 06:13.000
No.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.220
I guess I'm in trouble,but
I don't know what for.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.950
And I'm sure as hell not
gonna start admitting stuff.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.530
I think you know exactly what you did.

06:21.440 --> 06:26.760
You won the essay contest,and,as promised,you're
gonna be published in the school paper tomorrow.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.180
You suck.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.210
Congratulations,samantha.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.460
Oh,you're gonna be a published writer!

06:35.100 --> 06:36.570
That is,if that's okay with you.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.340
Hell,yes.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.230
- She said yes!
- That's great.

06:40.330 --> 06:41.710
What time's she coming over?

06:41.770 --> 06:42.740
I don't know.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.580
What kind of food does she like?

06:44.630 --> 06:45.610
I don't know.

06:45.660 --> 06:46.470
What do you know?

06:46.560 --> 06:47.580
She said yes!

06:47.650 --> 06:49.580
Well,that is the most important thing.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.460
Now,how do I get her to like me?

06:51.530 --> 06:54.000
Well,if she's coming over,she
probably already does like you.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.960
Now all you have to do is make sure you're
dressed nice and tell her how good she looks.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.160
Is that how you got nanny deb?

07:00.370 --> 07:01.760
That and gin.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.120
Got any gin?

07:03.170 --> 07:05.970
Don't worry.I'll be there
the whole time if you need me.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.640
Still I'm working now
is that your heart again?

07:13.770 --> 07:15.290
Yeah.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.570
I'll be fine.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.880
I wish that beeper would beep already.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.700
Me too,buddy.

07:33.510 --> 07:37.350
Lucas is casting his movie in here
today,so the studio's off-limits.

07:38.190 --> 07:39.130
Sweet.

07:39.220 --> 07:40.640
Snow day.Later,teach.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.990
Oh,no,no.Not so fast.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.770
We still have work to dO.

07:44.850 --> 07:46.900
You're kidding,right?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.890
You're italian,right?

08:10.050 --> 08:11.150
Easy,girl.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.570
- I saw that.
- What?

08:14.310 --> 08:16.240
Did you greet all the
other brookes that way?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.280
No,ma'am.That I saved just for you.

08:18.380 --> 08:21.520
And the guy playing
whitey,who is just so cute.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.430
So,do you want to meet brooke dav?

08:25.180 --> 08:26.520
Shut up.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.200
She's here?

08:27.300 --> 08:28.940
Yeah.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.210
I just got butterflies a little bit.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.460
Now I know how people must feel when
they're meeting me for the first time.

08:38.409 --> 08:39.220
missy,this is.

08:39.289 --> 08:40.350
- brooke davis!
- Yep.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.340
Brooke,this is.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.559
Missy me!

08:42.620 --> 08:45.350
I guess we made the right choice.

08:46.710 --> 08:49.300
Okay,I want my part in
the movie to be the best.

08:49.370 --> 08:50.760
So anything that you need,you just ask.

08:50.820 --> 08:55.420
Okay,great,because I'm a method actor,so I'm gonna
need to know your likes,dislikes,mannerisms --

08:55.500 --> 08:58.540
basically be glued to you until
the movie starts.What do you think?

08:58.740 --> 09:00.970
Sounds.great.

09:04.550 --> 09:05.790
You wantnted to see me,coach?

09:05.850 --> 09:07.180
I diD.

09:11.190 --> 09:13.460
I want to ask you
something in confidence.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.660
What do you think of devon?

09:16.470 --> 09:18.460
In confidence.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.300
I think he puts up big numbers,but
he won't win you any gameS.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.180
He doesn't care abt the team.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.370
He only cares about
getting himself to the nba.

09:27.430 --> 09:29.130
And you don't want to get to the nba?

09:29.190 --> 09:30.510
No,I do.

09:30.570 --> 09:35.200
But you're the only reason I have a shot at
it,so I owe you,and I'm gonna play my heart out.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.450
Look.

09:37.700 --> 09:43.040
If you started me,you'd be replacing your star player
with a player that gives you wins instead of headaches.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.210
You sound like a salesman,nate.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.040
I believe in what I'm sellinG.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.960
So do I.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.520
You're starting next game.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.710
Be ready.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.290
I want to draw something that
means something to someone.

10:02.450 --> 10:05.280
You're always saving me,lucas.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.070
I love you,luke.

10:08.180 --> 10:10.750
But I've chosen darkness.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.110
That was great.Thank yoU.

10:12.190 --> 10:13.610
Thanks.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.410
I loved "trouser hound," by the way.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.210
He loves you,too.

10:19.580 --> 10:20.670
Thanks.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.010
There's something about that one.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.410
She wants to sleep with you?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.760
There it is.So,we done?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.240
I liked the first girl.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.150
I'm just not sure.

10:33.230 --> 10:35.390
Two things -- number
one,big wedding ring.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.240
Number two,even bigger nose.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.460
She can lose the ring,but the
schnoz is gonna need its own trailer.

10:40.510 --> 10:41.640
Okay,there's nothing
wrong with her nose.

10:41.710 --> 10:46.000
Besides,I'm not casting this movie
based on who I want to sleep with.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.510
He has no idea what he's doinG.

10:50.460 --> 10:51.840
It's called having integrity.

10:51.930 --> 10:53.240
It's called being naivE.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.840
Look,you have decision to make,okay?

10:54.980 --> 10:57.050
Audiences like boobs.I
didn't make that uP.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.360
It's just -- it's
the way it is.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.540
Sex sells.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.710
So I say go with the
girl with the nice rack.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.060
Now,if you want to disagree
with me,fine,go ahead.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.120
But just make a damn decision,man.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.880
Adam,maybe you should take a break.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.180
You're right.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.410
This place is dead anywaY.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.180
"Swingers.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.660
" Julian,I didn't get to
choose a director I like.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.250
I'm not making the same
mistake with peyton.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.130
Okay,that's fine.But reese is right.

11:23.230 --> 11:25.550
You ed to come to a decision
you can both live with,okay?

11:25.570 --> 11:29.160
Like it or not,we have a
deadline,and you have a job to do.

11:30.430 --> 11:31.800
This job sucks.

11:31.860 --> 11:33.660
I don't think this is righT.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.480
Itit looks fine to me.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.450
Done and done.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.810
Okay,well,then,what is that for?

11:41.350 --> 11:43.220
I don't know -- to keep
the baby from moving?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.440
Why don't you just have lucas do it?

11:44.520 --> 11:47.730
Because he's busy,and we
are two strong,capable women.

11:47.810 --> 11:49.900
We can do this.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.670
- what's chase doing?
- Uh,no.

11:51.740 --> 11:52.990
He's busy.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.440
with me.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.670
So,I'll see yA.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.710
I mean,arrivederci.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.330
I got it when I was 12,but I
don't know why you need to know.

12:06.430 --> 12:09.040
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day
to get your voice to sound like this?

12:09.110 --> 12:11.450
I don't smoke,and my voice
doesn't sound like that.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.090
How many guys did you
sleep with in high school?

12:14.170 --> 12:15.320
Gee,I don't know.

12:15.370 --> 12:16.900
I was never very good at math.

12:16.990 --> 12:18.700
Dumb at math.Got it.

12:18.790 --> 12:20.680
Both: What do you think of this outfit?

12:20.770 --> 12:22.880
I don't think that brooke
would wear something like this.

12:22.930 --> 12:24.900
I am brooke,and i did
wear something like that.

12:24.940 --> 12:28.870
But don't you think it should be a little
more revealing or easy to strip off at least --

12:28.920 --> 12:30.310
you know,brooke-ish?

12:30.340 --> 12:32.640
I don't strip things off.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.940
The outfit is fine.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.000
Julian,what do you think?

12:36.030 --> 12:38.770
Um,it could be a little sexier.

12:38.950 --> 12:41.570
Should I just go ahead
and put her in pasties?

12:41.620 --> 12:43.540
Come on,brooke.Did you really
wear that in high school?

12:43.590 --> 12:44.700
Yes,I did.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.650
Maybe during your "clean teen" days.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.750
Just make it a little sexier,you know?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.280
Brooke-ish.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.050
Oh,you totally have a type.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.490
He looks a lot like lucas.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.620
That's another thing you should
know about me for the movie.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.450
I lash out sometimes.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.900
SorrY.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.780
"Part of me is glad that jack's gone.

13:08.860 --> 13:14.890
"Gone is a place I dreamed of when I was hiding in a
closet "from whatever drunk parent I had that month.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.080
But
--"

13:18.560 --> 13:20.430
Whose phone is that?

13:24.030 --> 13:25.420
YourS.

13:30.150 --> 13:31.730
Is everything okay?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.900
I just wanted you to
be the first to knoW.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.340
I'm starting next game.

13:37.890 --> 13:39.890
I couldn't have done
this without you,hales.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.310
I love you.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.090
Tell jamie I'll call him later,okay?

13:43.160 --> 13:44.550
I love you,too.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.570
He's -- he's
starting!

13:53.510 --> 13:54.720
Sorry,sam.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.350
"But I got lucky.

14:05.130 --> 14:06.830
" You must be lauren's mom.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.990
You must not talk to many women.

14:09.070 --> 14:11.310
I'm lauren,jamie's teacher.

14:11.390 --> 14:13.510
He invited me to his
grandpa's house after school,.

14:13.590 --> 14:17.650
and I just couldn't turn down an afternoon
with a cute boy and a little old man

14:19.570 --> 14:20.960
You're not a little old man.

14:21.010 --> 14:22.370
No.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.070
Grandpa dan,aren't you
gonna invite her in?

14:26.380 --> 14:28.390
You look very nice,miss lauren.

14:28.470 --> 14:31.840
Thank you.It's what I was
wearing at school earlier.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.290
Well,it's very becoming.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.780
Shall we?

14:34.860 --> 14:36.430
Thank you.

14:44.790 --> 14:46.310
so,what did you do?

14:46.430 --> 14:48.700
Nothing.The principal just
wanted to meet with mE.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.360
You're probably in trouble.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.800
With the new
principal,everyone's in trouble.

14:59.810 --> 15:02.430
Mrs.Scott,could you come in,please?s?

15:07.430 --> 15:09.900
Am I in trouble,principal rimkus?

15:14.650 --> 15:16.340
Do you know why I wanted to see you?

15:16.420 --> 15:17.900
No.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.350
And I'm not gonna start admitting stuff.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.880
I have a problem with the essay
you selected for the school paper.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.030
Oh,sam's essay?What's wrong with it?

15:30.150 --> 15:33.280
What,you mean besides all the
references to sex and drugs?

15:33.530 --> 15:36.150
She's witnessed some really
horrible things growing up.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.600
I think that's what makes
the essay so important.

15:38.650 --> 15:39.970
Well,that may be.

15:40.050 --> 15:42.700
But I have the students and
their parents to worry about.

15:44.320 --> 15:49.930
I-I understand,but with all due respect,I thought I was in
charge of the school paper and had final say on what went in it.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.550
You do.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.060
And I have final say on
whether or not you work here.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.460
Pick another essay.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.820
So,when you stop to think about
it,where does the sidewalk end?

16:05.910 --> 16:07.860
You know,I never
really thought about it.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.510
Jamie's always been
advanced for his age.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.510
Right now he's reading
the "time traveler's wife.

16:11.530 --> 16:13.900
" Oh,that's one of my favorite books.

16:13.990 --> 16:15.440
Mine too.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.010
That's great.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.670
How about I refill your kool-aid?

16:18.770 --> 16:21.300
Well,thank you,jamie.That
is very gentlemanly of yoU.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.050
We have wine,if you prefer.

16:23.100 --> 16:28.010
Kool-aid will be fine.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.060
Hey,skills.You looking for luke?

16:34.150 --> 16:35.080
No.

16:35.150 --> 16:36.810
I'm the baby-proofer.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.440
Why didn't I know that?

16:38.490 --> 16:40.330
Who brags about being a baby-proofer?

16:40.410 --> 16:43.870
Oh,okay.I mean,I think
our house is pretty safe.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.610
I can spot at least 20 pbis already.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.920
Huh?

16:48.980 --> 16:50.600
Possible baby injuries.

16:51.430 --> 16:52.050
Like what?

16:52.160 --> 16:53.810
Well,for one,lamp cord strangles.

16:53.850 --> 16:56.110
- Okay.
- OutletelectrocutE.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.610
And I'm guessing you probably don't
have a lock on the toilet seat.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.160
Luke barely remembers to put it down.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.240
Funny.

17:02.290 --> 17:04.040
But you know what's not so funny?

17:04.160 --> 17:08.380
When junk was a kid,he fell
in a toilet --almost drowned.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.730
He was dead for 40 seconds.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.240
I'm -- no,I'm sorry.You're
right.That's totally not funny.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.890
Um,I have a lot of work to do,huh?

17:19.970 --> 17:21.150
YeP.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.650
But you got lucas to help you,right?

17:22.700 --> 17:25.109
No,I mean,he's over at
tric casting his moviE.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.950
But I ha--
I have it.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.350
It's fine.That's not done,by the way.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.600
I hope not.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.000
I can see at least 30 pbis already.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.680
If you need help putting that
thing back together,give me a call.

17:50.780 --> 17:52.840
I'm also a handyman.

18:04.190 --> 18:07.060
Heard any word from jack yet?

18:10.410 --> 18:11.090
no.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.510
That's kind of why I hang here.

18:13.610 --> 18:16.640
I figure this is where he'll
show when he decides to come back.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.190
if he decides to.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.920
I'm sure he will.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.140
Yeah.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.530
I hope so.

18:25.850 --> 18:28.700
could you really get fired
for publishing my paper?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.410
Where did you hear that?

18:30.480 --> 18:35.020
I've already lost jack.I really don't
want to lose you to some stupid paper.

18:35.210 --> 18:38.690
You -- you're
not gonna lose me.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.320
And your paper's
anything but stupid,saM.

18:44.060 --> 18:45.130
Well,I better get going.

18:45.210 --> 18:46.920
Don't want brooke to worry.

18:50.650 --> 18:52.110
Listen,haley.

18:52.210 --> 18:53.630
I appreciate it.I do.

18:53.790 --> 18:57.450
But if I were you,I would
just choose a different paper.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.580
It's not worth it.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.700
Looks like 12's the new 23.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.380
what's up?

19:28.490 --> 19:29.970
Like you don't knoW.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.330
Coach cut his best player
to start his best friend.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.010
I didn't know he was cutting you.

19:36.120 --> 19:40.220
I thought
--I'm sorrY.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.580
Don't be.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.490
I'm going to the nba anyway.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.860
- Somehow
--girl: Daddy!

19:49.260 --> 19:52.080
Hey,boo.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.430
There's my teaM.

19:56.430 --> 19:58.450
daddy's gonna be okay.

19:59.890 --> 20:01.940
What you looking at,12?

20:02.010 --> 20:04.500
You're not the only one with a family.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.660
Wedding.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.160
Wedding.Wedding.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.510
Baby.

20:20.380 --> 20:24.010
Is there a reason that we're registering for
the wedding and the baby at the same time?

20:24.080 --> 20:27.290
Well,they're happening at the same
time,so why not register them together?

20:27.360 --> 20:31.170
Because I may have registered
the baby for a boning knife.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.050
That's got to be a pbi,right?

20:34.060 --> 20:37.860
I swear,I love you,but are you sure you
would not rather be doing this with lucas?

20:37.920 --> 20:38.720
No.

20:38.770 --> 20:44.550
He is busy and there is no one I would rather do
this with than my best friend and my maid of honor.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.800
Maid of honor?Really?

20:46.970 --> 20:48.520
Well,it shouldn't be a surprise.

20:48.610 --> 20:50.200
But it's so nice to hear!

20:50.270 --> 20:51.860
Okay!

20:53.290 --> 20:54.710
Want to know what I think?

20:54.800 --> 20:59.800
I think that nathan likes tutor girl,but tutor girl likes lucas,and
I know I like lucas,and I don't know who the hell you like anymore.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.870
This is all turning into one big love
rectangle plus one,whatever that is.

21:04.060 --> 21:05.280
Pretty good,right?

21:05.330 --> 21:06.910
Yeah.AwesomE.

21:08.110 --> 21:09.500
Dude,she sounds like yoU.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.610
I was never that annoyinG.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.690
I know how you feeL.

21:11.790 --> 21:14.910
I was in tric earlier today,and there were
10 peyton sawyers bitching and moaning.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.860
Oh,so there were 11 of
you bitching and moaning?

21:18.390 --> 21:20.070
I think I like that other one better.

21:23.010 --> 21:27.730
So,I'm driving jamie home from school,and he suddenly yells
at me to stop the car because orval got out of the bag.

21:27.810 --> 21:30.280
- Oh,and who's orval?
- My question exactlY.

21:30.340 --> 21:32.740
Orval is his pet
rabbit's imaginary friend.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.040
Oh,that's so cute.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.580
And he insists that orval has
gone into a chuck E.Cheese.

21:36.660 --> 21:39.490
So,since we're already
there,why not grab some pizza?

21:39.590 --> 21:41.380
Oh,he's crafty.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.570
You're making fun of me?

21:43.660 --> 21:44.620
,NoI wasn't.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.530
You're trying to embarrass me so
miss lauren will like you better.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.610
JamiE.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.480
He was in prison!

21:59.610 --> 22:00.810
hey,yo,man.

22:00.910 --> 22:02.530
I heard you was castg today.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.500
Hey,who's gonna play fergie?

22:04.690 --> 22:07.450
Uh,man,uh.

22:07.520 --> 22:12.820
you know,when I turned the book into a
movie,I had to omit some of the characters.

22:13.380 --> 22:14.730
Look,I'm really sorry,fergie.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.100
I didn'T.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.470
then who did luke hang
with on the river court?

22:18.520 --> 22:20.320
Mouth.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.980
and skills.

22:22.010 --> 22:24.200
You gonna play me like that?

22:24.290 --> 22:26.400
That's cold,dawg.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.300
Look,fergie.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.570
which do you like better?

22:30.570 --> 22:31.720
They look the same,man.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.470
We're gonna need you to sign off on
a few locations before we can move on.

22:34.530 --> 22:35.120
Okay.

22:35.180 --> 22:37.660
hey,man,I am trying to wrap my
head around this dan character.

22:37.710 --> 22:39.720
I don't get why he's got
all this hatred for keith.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.770
Reese wants to sign off
on peyton number three.

22:41.810 --> 22:42.570
Are you okay with that?

22:42.630 --> 22:44.070
No!I like the first one.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.840
Antouc sam?

22:45.890 --> 22:47.020
Peyton's a love interest.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.080
Think about it with your other head.

22:48.150 --> 22:51.820
I know you have a vision,lucas,but maybe you
need to trust reese's experience on this one.

22:51.890 --> 22:53.800
Our table read is tomorrow,and
we can't do it without a peyton.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.020
I know,all right!I just
need to think about it!

22:56.070 --> 22:56.820
We don't have time for that.

22:56.860 --> 22:58.010
Well,make.

22:58.050 --> 22:59.810
time!

23:03.760 --> 23:06.130
And.scenE.

23:11.210 --> 23:13.580
so,which ones do you
think lucas will like?

23:13.970 --> 23:16.380
Whichever ones you're naked iN.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.510
Speaking of nakeD.

23:21.340 --> 23:23.630
I slept with juliaN.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.080
Come again?

23:25.170 --> 23:27.140
That's what she said.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.390
She being me
-- it's a joke.

23:29.470 --> 23:30.680
I-I know.I get it.

23:30.790 --> 23:34.390
Um,god,why am I just
finding out about this now?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.980
'Cause I've been really
scared to tell you.

23:37.060 --> 23:42.370
I know that you said it's fine,but I kind of
still feel like it violates girl code somehow,

23:42.480 --> 23:48.400
and I know you're happy and engaged
and pregnant,and -- and he's charming.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.390
Brooke,hey,really.

23:50.570 --> 23:51.850
it's fine.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.240
We talked about this,all right?

23:53.320 --> 23:55.810
Girl code was shattered years ago.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.350
You promise?

23:57.350 --> 23:59.700
You're not gonna revoke
my maid-of-honor car god.

23:59.770 --> 24:01.740
Of course I promise.

24:01.830 --> 24:03.310
Come here.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.000
I mean,you know that's like
three guys we've shared,right?

24:08.550 --> 24:10.820
Lucas,juliaN.

24:11.010 --> 24:12.930
Um,sex tape?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.350
Sex tape.I forgot about that,and
i kind of wish that you had,too.

24:17.510 --> 24:18.490
Oh,no,no,no.

24:18.580 --> 24:23.630
Um,so just how did it go
from being a non-date to sex?

24:23.730 --> 24:24.870
It was the grin,right?

24:24.930 --> 24:26.620
That didn't hurt.

24:26.660 --> 24:30.930
And then he threw in a touch
of sweet and so much sincerity.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.780
And then he threw in the
letterman jacket I made him.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.830
Oh,well,letterman
jacket.That's a good touch.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.860
High-school brooke did letter in sex.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.080
how's the movie biz?

24:47.200 --> 24:50.110
Well,I had my first diva moment
-- threw a temper tantrum.

24:50.190 --> 24:51.690
No way.Damn.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.830
Wish I'd have been here to see it.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.210
Uh,stick around.

24:54.290 --> 24:55.580
I'm sure I'll have another.

24:55.630 --> 24:57.200
Is it really that bad?

24:57.270 --> 25:01.130
I can't even pick a basketball much less a peyton
without feeling like I'm making the wrong decision.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.240
My gut says one thing,and
everybody else says something else.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.750
Who cares what everybody else says?

25:05.810 --> 25:07.390
Go with your gut.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.720
Just likhuthat,h?

25:08.750 --> 25:10.600
Lucas,this was your
book,and now it's your movie.

25:10.650 --> 25:12.850
You know the characters,and you
know tree hill better than anybody.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.980
You should have some faith in
yourself,for crying out louD.

25:15.030 --> 25:15.740
I love you.I love you.

25:15.810 --> 25:16.870
- i know
- You know that?

25:16.940 --> 25:18.610
You know,they should name
an antidepressant after you.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.860
Yeah.

25:19.910 --> 25:21.200
Great with everybody else's proemS.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.370
It's my own I'm a basket case with.

25:23.840 --> 25:24.770
All right,well.

25:24.820 --> 25:26.190
psychotherapist luke.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.420
Can I help you with anything?

25:28.520 --> 25:30.720
Sam wrote this paper for my class.

25:30.780 --> 25:36.690
It was gritty and harsh and honest and really
beautiful,and I want to publish it in the school papeR.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.020
And principal rimkus won't let me.

25:39.970 --> 25:42.190
Well,what else can you do?

25:42.350 --> 25:44.230
I could publish it anyway.

25:44.530 --> 25:47.510
Kids like sam,they -- sometimes
all they have is a voice,

25:47.630 --> 25:51.180
and if you take that away from them,especially
after everything that she's been through,

25:51.260 --> 25:54.310
then what's the point of me even
calling myself a teacher anymore?

25:54.420 --> 25:57.080
Well,it sounds to me like you've
already made your decision.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.290
I'm just not sure it's the right one.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.330
Man,you got to have some
faith in yourself sometimes.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.880
No,go with your gut.Come on.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.110
What's the worst that can happen?

26:04.130 --> 26:07.120
I could get fired,or at least suspended.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.420
I've been suspended
-- not that bad.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.900
You're pretty good
at cheering me up,too.

26:21.610 --> 26:22.890
Go away!You're mean!

26:22.960 --> 26:25.780
That's why daddy and
uncle lucas don't like you.

26:28.590 --> 26:30.610
That's true.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.570
S I wamean.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.960
And they have every
reason not to like me.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.600
But ever since I got sick,I've tried
real hard to be a better person.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.670
Then why were you making fun of me?

26:43.750 --> 26:46.070
I would never make fun of you.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.220
You're my best
friend.Don't you know that?

26:50.820 --> 26:51.740
Actually,you're my only friend.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.100
I don't even have an imaginary one.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.420
Miss lauren doesn't think I'm a joke?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.830
Of course not.You're
her favorite studenT.

26:59.260 --> 27:01.970
She told me this is one of the
best dates she's ever been oN.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.600
She said that?

27:03.660 --> 27:05.420
She sure did.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.170
You should go back in
there and finish the date.

27:09.780 --> 27:12.060
And if I hurt your feelings,I'm sorry.

27:12.220 --> 27:14.810
I would never do anything
to hurt my best friend.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.130
I forgive you.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.620
Well,aren't you coming?

27:24.060 --> 27:26.130
You'll be fine without me.

27:42.910 --> 27:45.330
I just wanted to make sure I
got your signature move righT.

27:45.390 --> 27:46.990
What is with you idiots?

27:47.050 --> 27:49.530
This is not my signature move.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.830
And fyi,I did a lot more in high
school than just have sex,okay?

27:52.900 --> 27:54.150
I was student-body president.

27:54.230 --> 27:55.690
I was the captain of
the cheerleading squad.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.870
I started a clothing line.

27:56.930 --> 27:59.130
It is amazing that I
even had time for sex!

27:59.190 --> 28:00.570
Sorry.I didn't mean to offend you.

28:00.650 --> 28:03.180
I was just following the breakdown.

28:06.840 --> 28:11.250
"Brooke davis -- gorgeous brunette
"with an amazing energy and smile.

28:12.250 --> 28:17.520
"Her three favorite
things --sex,sex,and sex.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.030
" Coach.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.130
Ntedi wa to talk to you about devon.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.810
I didn't mean for you to cut him.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.310
Well,good,because it wasn't your calL.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.180
I cut devon because he
wouldn't play for me.

28:31.250 --> 28:34.540
And that crap he pulled the other
night -- that's the last straw.

28:34.610 --> 28:37.420
Okay,well,maybe you could talk
to him about it or something.

28:37.730 --> 28:39.320
Coach,the guy has a family.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.250
So do you,nathan.So do I.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.620
Look,this is a business.

28:42.690 --> 28:45.570
You two aren't the only ones
whose end game is the nba.

28:45.630 --> 28:47.670
I'm certainly not gonna get
there coaching a losing team.

28:47.710 --> 28:50.140
I understand.Okay,maybe
devon and I can work together.

28:50.510 --> 28:52.210
It's done,nathan.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.690
You're my starter now.I need
for you to focus on thaT.

28:55.580 --> 28:58.120
Who's more important
here -- you or devon?

29:00.530 --> 29:02.470
My family is more important.

29:02.580 --> 29:03.540
All right,then.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.180
We're done herE.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.330
I'll see you in practice tomorrow.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.860
Stop it!

29:22.380 --> 29:23.920
He already cast me.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.000
Excuse me.

29:28.110 --> 29:30.160
It's like "the twilight zone" in here!

29:30.660 --> 29:31.630
You!

29:31.710 --> 29:34.140
How could you write such
horrible things about me?

29:34.200 --> 29:38.200
You,who called me your pretty girl and said
that I was gonna change the world someday?

29:38.710 --> 29:39.570
What are you talking about?

29:39.660 --> 29:41.710
Tell me that you didn't write that!

29:43.520 --> 29:44.770
I didn't write this.

29:44.830 --> 29:46.180
Then who did?

29:46.230 --> 29:52.050
I'll take the third haley's legs,the first
brooke's fun bags,and the last peyton's ass.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.010
I take the real brooke daviS.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.120
Here's your stupid jacket.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.490
I should have seen this coming.

30:02.590 --> 30:08.060
You related to my character in the book,and you wanted all my
wardrobe to be sexier,and you gave me your letterman jackeT.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.310
You want high-school brooke?

30:09.360 --> 30:12.680
I have news for you.I
am not that girl anymore.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.190
There is a lot more to me than just sex.

30:15.270 --> 30:17.350
Brooke -- high-school
brooke graduated!

30:17.430 --> 30:19.250
Hey,brooke!

30:22.070 --> 30:25.370
Don't worry.I know where you can
find five more who look just like heR.

30:37.000 --> 30:37.780
Oh,hey.

30:37.890 --> 30:39.290
You're baby-proofing.

30:39.410 --> 30:41.950
Don't forget the laundry rooM.Jamie
used to take naps in the dryer.

30:42.030 --> 30:43.970
Yeah,I got it.

30:44.250 --> 30:49.150
The toilet,the cupboards,fridge.What
else does a baby get into?

30:49.230 --> 30:50.770
Your heart.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.520
I love iT.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.590
Good.Thanks.

31:00.660 --> 31:04.690
I saw you registered for a ning knife,but I
figured that was more practical for a newborn.

31:06.450 --> 31:07.920
How you holding up?

31:07.980 --> 31:09.590
I don't know.

31:10.780 --> 31:14.790
One minute,I'm shopping,and the
next,I feel like I'm gonna cry.

31:14.890 --> 31:16.700
Tell me that's normal.

31:16.780 --> 31:21.640
Just remember,things are never as bad as you think they are,even
though your hormones are trying to convince you otherwisE.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.080
I know,I know.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.700
Um,I just -- I keep telling
everybody that I'm okaY.

31:27.180 --> 31:30.990
But doing all this baby stuff just
really makes me wish that lucas was herE.

31:31.120 --> 31:36.610
I've got this doctor's appointment tomorrow that I
really want him to go to,but he's so busy with the movie.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.920
Well,if you want him to
go,why don't you just tell him?

31:39.220 --> 31:41.060
I did.I told him last week.

31:41.140 --> 31:44.690
But with everything that's going
on,he's -- you know,he's swamped,

31:44.820 --> 31:47.370
and I don't want to be a nag.

31:47.490 --> 31:50.150
I think you should nag him
anyway.That boy needs iT.

31:51.460 --> 31:53.050
Thanks.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.950
And thanks for being so good with luke.

31:55.050 --> 31:56.980
You make everything better for us.

32:01.370 --> 32:03.230
Sorry I'm late.I'll start dinneR.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.110
Or we can order pizza.

32:05.130 --> 32:07.180
Sam,I am not in high school anymore.

32:07.230 --> 32:12.660
I can make you a grown-up
dinner,like a salad or A.

32:12.740 --> 32:14.340
roast.

32:14.830 --> 32:17.790
Okay,I was just thinking
maybe we could celebrate?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.240
Okay.

32:19.310 --> 32:20.650
What should we celebrate?

32:20.720 --> 32:25.220
The fact that I filly ditched my clone or that
julian thinks that I am a teenage nymphomaniac?

32:25.270 --> 32:31.700
Um,I was just kind of thinking maybe we could
celebrate me winning the school essay contest.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.300
Really?

32:36.740 --> 32:39.270
Sam,that's amazing.

32:40.670 --> 32:42.850
"Homeless in high school.

32:42.960 --> 32:47.270
" It's about me and jack --
how rough fe can be on your own.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.480
All that fun stuff.

32:51.620 --> 32:54.400
I am so proud of you.

32:56.150 --> 32:57.860
Thank yoU.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.410
Can I put it on the fridge?

33:00.990 --> 33:02.960
Yeah.

33:04.470 --> 33:05.670
Brooke.

33:06.220 --> 33:10.370
I don't know why you're so mad at
julian,but at least he's still arounD.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.080
I would give anything to have jack bacK.

33:13.140 --> 33:14.720
Yeah.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.150
But we should be celebrating that.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.890
So,what do you want to do?

33:19.980 --> 33:22.180
I want to eat pizzA.

33:22.290 --> 33:24.230
Seriously?

33:25.060 --> 33:26.650
Okay.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.270
So thanks for tonight,jamie.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.030
I'll see you in school tomorrow?

33:30.370 --> 33:31.880
ByE.

33:48.850 --> 33:51.730
So,how did the rest of your evening go?

33:51.860 --> 33:52.950
So-sO.

33:53.010 --> 33:57.540
She just wanted to talk about adult
stuff like a new car and maroon 5.

33:57.650 --> 34:00.430
Next time,I think I should
date someone my own age.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.720
Or younger.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.270
I'm sorry I called you mean.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.159
Next time,we should
just do a guys' nighT.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.300
So,uh.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.350
we still friends?

34:15.060 --> 34:16.889
Best.

34:19.980 --> 34:21.810
Hey,it's me.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.449
Um,god,I'm sorry.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.630
I know you're busy.

34:24.690 --> 34:27.010
Just today has been.

34:28.139 --> 34:30.360
I tried putting the crib togetheR.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.270
I did.It just totally sucked.

34:32.340 --> 34:37.900
And every squarench of our house needs to be
baby-proofed,or our kid's gonna end up like junk.

34:38.239 --> 34:41.239
And I don't even know
what we're registered for.

34:41.429 --> 34:43.610
I really just wish you
could have been there.

34:43.690 --> 34:50.510
Um,and I wish you could be there for my doctor's
appointment tomorrow,but I know you're busy,and I just --

If you would like to erase and
re-record your message,press 2.

35:00.270 --> 35:01.490
Hi!

35:01.560 --> 35:02.930
It's me.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.170
Um,I put the crib together.

35:04.220 --> 35:05.360
It's awesome.

35:05.410 --> 35:09.710
So,I just want to call and say hi and
I miss you and come home soon,okay?

35:09.790 --> 35:11.070
Bye.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.040
You want to know what I think?

35:24.100 --> 35:25.820
I know what you thinK.

35:25.900 --> 35:28.240
You want the girl with the big breasts.

35:28.480 --> 35:32.540
Look,when I was casting "trouser hound,"

35:32.800 --> 35:36.060
I had a really tough time trying to
decide who should play miss kittingtoN.

35:36.140 --> 35:39.250
A director friend of mine told me to
close my eyes during the auditions.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.470
He said that was the best way to be able to
hear the actress and not just see a hot girL.

35:43.470 --> 35:44.600
Is that what you do?

35:44.650 --> 35:46.780
No!I picked the actss
with the best rack.

35:46.830 --> 35:48.790
You just looked like
you needed some advice.

35:51.150 --> 35:53.690
Well,hellO.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.810
Leave us.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.730
Actually,I-I want to
speak to both of you.

36:00.310 --> 36:02.350
I really want to play peyton.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.740
I feel that I identify with her.

36:04.850 --> 36:09.970
We were both in the popular crowd in
school even though we felt like outcasts,

36:10.060 --> 36:16.020
and we both feel that the first song you hear
in the morning can affect your entire daY.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.360
And I'll totally sleep with you.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.150
You too.

36:23.210 --> 36:25.060
Well,look at you go.

36:25.180 --> 36:28.600
You just made my
decision very,very easy.

36:30.310 --> 36:32.030
Mine,too.

36:32.130 --> 36:36.190
Playing the role of peyton
sawyer is miss heidi jay.

36:38.310 --> 36:39.840
Sorry,but the other
girl just wasn't peyton.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.290
I had to go with my gut.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.450
No worries.She was peyton
last night -- and I was lucas.

36:44.570 --> 36:47.500
Everyone,welcome to the table
read for "an unkindness of ravens.

36:47.550 --> 36:48.800

Oh,that's right.

37:17.110 --> 37:20.340
You only 6'2",so I guess
that'd make you sprout.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.030
What are you doing here,nino?

37:22.090 --> 37:23.720
Playing point guard.

37:23.770 --> 37:26.500
Or at least I will be as soon as
you get the hell up out of my spot.

37:28.070 --> 37:29.990

38:26.460 --> 38:29.770
I know you're not the person you were
in high school,'cause I'm not,either.

38:30.500 --> 38:34.530
And I'm glad,because that kid never
would have stood a chance with you.

38:39.340 --> 38:42.030
were you really a mathlete?

38:42.060 --> 38:44.190
I was the mathlete.

38:45.450 --> 38:49.610

don't want high-school brooke.

38:49.970 --> 38:51.510
I'm sorry the breakdown
hurt your feelings.

38:51.560 --> 38:56.520
It was meant to describe who the character
was before anyone got to know the real person.

That's a breakdown describing
the brooke davis I'm looking for.
