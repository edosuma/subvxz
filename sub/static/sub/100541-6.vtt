WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.470
(Muzak playing)

00:03.871 --> 00:08.376
"Total protection
from the sun."

00:08.976 --> 00:12.146
(up-tempo folk music)

00:14.348 --> 00:15.816
-VOCALIST: Hey!
-(bat squeaks)

00:25.025 --> 00:28.596
You should play the drums.
I feel like no one knows.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.198
On that musty-ass kit?

00:30.231 --> 00:32.133
Dude, I'm too good
for this talent show.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.534
Foo...

00:33.567 --> 00:36.270
-ALL: Foo...
-JAKE: Tuna,

00:36.304 --> 00:37.971
you need to stop lying.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.208
-There was candy.
-Why would I lie about that?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.876
If there was candy in my pubes,
that would be awesome.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.846
So your bush is just green
and looks like Pop Rocks?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.848
You just saw a straight bush.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.217
Hey, he's just mad
'cause he's got

00:49.250 --> 00:50.818
the smallest dick in the bunk.

00:50.851 --> 00:51.885
-(laughter)
-No, I don't.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.554
We haven't even seen
everyone's anyways.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.824
Well, considering Burd showers
with a bathing suit on,

00:56.857 --> 00:58.426
my money's on him.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.494
(laughter)

01:00.528 --> 01:02.530
I feel like dropping
a Burd Bomb.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.831
-Oh, no way.
-Okay.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.499
-You guys want one?
-OTHERS: Yeah.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.602
Make this the funniest shit
I've ever saw.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.604
(exhales sharply)

01:13.040 --> 01:15.376
What did the Chinese
restaurant owner do

01:15.409 --> 01:17.010
on Christmas Day, when he knew

01:17.044 --> 01:19.747
every single Jew would be
coming in for his foo?

01:19.780 --> 01:20.881
OTHERS:
What?

01:22.183 --> 01:25.153
He got ahead of it.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.020
(laughter)

01:30.057 --> 01:33.761
You got something... you got
something on your glasses.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.464
-Is that a booger I see?
-You got a little...

01:36.497 --> 01:37.998
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* I'm Lil Dicky *

01:38.031 --> 01:39.267
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* Who's Dave? *

01:39.300 --> 01:40.568
* Hi, I'm Dave. *

01:40.601 --> 01:43.537
DAVE: Oh, my God, the
anticipation. Please, please,

01:43.571 --> 01:45.373
-please, please...
-CAROL: Company chicken

01:45.406 --> 01:48.342
and company noodles
for my little boy.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.245
Mmm! This looks like
a very strong batch.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.580
Thanks, sweet'ums.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.047
Why do y'all call it
company chicken?

01:54.081 --> 01:56.016
Uh, it's what I made whenever
company came over.

01:56.049 --> 01:59.253
Elliot was company quite often.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.021
Oh, that's so cute, Elliot.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.423
(whispers):
Burn in hell.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.925
Oh, David,
I used more of the gift card.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.228
I love that spa,

02:07.261 --> 02:10.531
and I think of you every time
I get facials.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.532
GATA:
Y'all got any more of these
crackers?

02:11.565 --> 02:14.101
Oh, you like the matzah?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.070
Like the cheese? This
mozzarella and cheese crackers?

02:17.104 --> 02:20.474
-No, that's unleavened bread.
-Bad bite. Ow. Sorry.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.075
-Bad bite.
-So, uh, Gator,

02:22.109 --> 02:24.645
is this your first time
in Philadelphia?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.280
Nah, I been here a few times,
like, you know,

02:26.314 --> 02:27.948
when my boy used to open up
for Tyga.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.517
-Uh-huh.
-Gator, Tiger.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.219
Who's next, Armadillo?

02:31.252 --> 02:32.620
(both laugh)

02:32.653 --> 02:34.788
G-A-T-A, you know, it stands for
Going Against the Average.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.690
You know what I mean? I'm trying
to be way above average.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.991
I love that.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.793
It's an acronym,
it's not reptilian.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.695
-CAROL: Oh.
-Wait, speaking of reptiles,

02:41.729 --> 02:43.831
what ever happened
to Lenny and Lenny?

02:43.864 --> 02:46.600
They died years ago.
We had two turtles,

02:46.634 --> 02:49.737
but we couldn't tell them apart,
so Lenny, Lenny.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.772
Actually, they drowned in their
own "feshus."

02:51.805 --> 02:55.142
Yeah. It was an allergic
reaction to the bacteria...

02:55.175 --> 02:58.746
-(mutters)
-It's-it's feces, Don.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.448
That's what I said, feshus.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.615
No. F...

03:01.649 --> 03:03.217
-I just...
-Feces.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.852
That's what-- I said "feshus."

03:04.885 --> 03:07.120
-Don-Don, are you saying
"feshus"?
-"Feshus." Yes.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.122
Fesh-- Yeah, that's right.
That's right. Feshus.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.123
-Th-Thank you, Michael.
-Feshus?

03:10.157 --> 03:11.359
CAROL:
It's feces.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.026
All right, I feel like I'm being
punk'd right now.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.629
-Okay, Michael, Michael...
-Feshus, yeah, feshus. Mm-hmm?

03:15.663 --> 03:19.300
Um, how are ticket sales
being handled

03:19.333 --> 03:21.134
for Dave's concert?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.170
They're-- What are you--
I don't-- What do you mean?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.005
-What does that--
What do you mean?
-Well, I mean, how...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.640
Hey, honey, they just got in,
you know?

03:26.674 --> 03:29.310
You don't have to ask every
question right now.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.078
-Okay.
-He has a lot to do.

03:31.111 --> 03:34.582
Fine. Perfect. So, I don't want
to take up your time tomorrow.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.084
She's farshtunken.
What-what can I say?

03:37.117 --> 03:38.886
MIKE:
I get it. We're all excited.
No, I know, we're--

03:38.919 --> 03:40.053
-Oh, there's a list.
-CAROL: Okay, hang on.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.989
-Okay.
-What is that?

03:42.022 --> 03:44.692
So, I have some questions.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.527
Uh, is it assigned seating?

03:46.560 --> 03:51.665
Oh, God, is there seating or-or
is this like a mash pit?

03:51.699 --> 03:53.934
Because we have invited
friends...

03:53.967 --> 03:56.270
-They can't stand.
-DAVE: Speaking of friends...
-Yeah.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.707
You got to get all of my camp
friends on the backstage list.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.575
Not just G.A.
I need all my early adopters

04:01.609 --> 04:04.345
-right there with me.
-Bro, why?

04:04.378 --> 04:05.746
What do you mean, why?

04:05.779 --> 04:10.050
Oh, can we take photos
or videos during the show?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.286
Yeah. I mean, yeah,

04:12.320 --> 04:14.922
-if you have your phone on you,
you certainly can.
-Oh, wait.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.890
This is a good-- Well, I'm not
gonna ask this. Don...

04:16.924 --> 04:18.592
-How long is this list?
-This is...

04:18.626 --> 04:20.060
-Don has a question.
That's your question.
-Thank you, thank you.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.296
Mike, Mike, will there--
will there be any situations

04:22.330 --> 04:23.997
that involve tipping?

04:24.031 --> 04:27.200
-Because maybe we need to bring
some small bills.
-(phone chimes)

04:27.234 --> 04:28.536
I don't think there's
a lot of tipping that goes on

04:28.569 --> 04:30.037
at concerts,
but that being said,

04:30.070 --> 04:32.840
I just have cash as just like
a kind of a-a rule of thumb.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.708
-CAROL: David... please.
-DON: That's very good.
-MIKE: Yeah, just in case.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.410
At the table, bro?
Come on, man.

04:36.444 --> 04:40.280
And, Gota, Gata, Gota...

04:40.314 --> 04:42.683
Yeah. My name is Davionte,
if that's easier,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.284
but you could just call me Gata.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.220
Okay. Gata,

04:47.254 --> 04:49.056
-what do you do?
-I'm the hype man.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.858
I remember all your son's songs
front to back,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.460
you know what I mean? Make sure
he doesn't miss a beat.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.728
Every other word, I'm there.
Hype! You know what I'm saying?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.129
-Oh, wow. (laughs)
-Know what I mean?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.765
-Get the crowd all hyped.
-Yeah.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.368
Left, right, hands in the air,
like you don't care type shit.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.703
Oops. I didn't mean
to cuss like that.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.772
You can curse in this house.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.807
Wait, we can curse
in this house now?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.942
Well, you're not ten.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.578
Nigga, what the fuck?

05:10.611 --> 05:12.380
(laughter)

05:12.413 --> 05:14.415
CAROL:
Okay.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.886
Welcome to the basement,
Mr. Gata.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.654
Damn, the basement, bro?
Come on, man.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.690
I know y'all got an attic, bro.
Put me at the top, bro.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.991
This shit sounds like
it's about to be

05:24.024 --> 05:25.626
dusty and crusty down here.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.062
-Damn! This shit is
hard as hell, bro.
-Mm-hmm.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.331
GATA:
Look at the decor, you got it
laid out for a peep.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.667
Best room in the whole house.
So many memories down here.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.335
So many memories. I see, bro.

05:35.369 --> 05:38.138
What's up with all the overnight
camp stuff, though?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.573
Did you lose your virginity
there or what?

05:39.607 --> 05:41.008
Uh, no, far from it.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.510
I actually never even kissed
a girl there.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.344
-Man.
-But it was, like, very--

05:44.378 --> 05:45.813
It's probably my favorite part
of life, to be honest.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.282
Like, that's where I really felt
like a star for the first time

05:49.316 --> 05:52.019
and developed as a performer.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.187
Like, there was this one
talent show in particular

05:54.221 --> 05:56.557
where I was not supposed to go
onstage at all,

05:56.590 --> 05:58.125
and the whole camp
just started chanting

05:58.158 --> 05:59.226
"We want Burd, we want Burd,"

05:59.259 --> 06:01.161
because I was so funny,
and everyone knew it.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.130
And I went onstage with, like,
no idea what I was going to do,

06:03.163 --> 06:04.364
and I killed it.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.866
And I feel like
from that point on,

06:05.899 --> 06:07.334
I just knew that I was

06:07.367 --> 06:10.337
destined to be, like, a star.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.972
Look at us now.
You in your hometown.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.173
We got to turn the fuck up,
my nigga.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.508
I got the hookup at a club,
baby.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.709
We got to go out and T up.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.445
To-- Out to the clu--

06:17.478 --> 06:19.847
I don't know. How do you know
someone in Philadelphia?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.314
You've been here for, like,
two hours.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.884
The dude at the airport, man.
He said, "Yo, come,

06:23.917 --> 06:26.687
bring LD, bitches, bottles,
table." (grunts)

06:26.720 --> 06:28.989
-I got a lot on my mind.
Let's take it one day at a time.
-All right. Bet.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.591
Are you good? Do you have
everything you need?

06:30.624 --> 06:33.360
-I'm a player, bro.
-What's that you're doing
with your hands?

06:33.393 --> 06:36.296
-Just makes me fall asleep
faster. I'm good, bro.
-Okay.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.865
Previously on
Tucking Gata In...

06:37.898 --> 06:39.299
Ah, I'm cool, bro.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.802
All right, last week, Gata
didn't want to get tucked in.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.237
-You tucking a grown-ass man
in, bro.
-That's right.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.906
Standard tucking, no big deal.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.140
Just getting the legs right.
Everything good.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.542
You know house rules.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.843
Are you, uh, good?
You're poofed, everything's...

06:49.877 --> 06:51.912
-Man, I'm good.
-All right, and one kiss

06:51.945 --> 06:53.380
on the cheek
and I am out of here.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.015
Ah, I'm cool on all that
funny shit, bro.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.250
Just one kiss and I'm gone.
Come.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.620
Nah, player. You know I ain't
rocking like that. I'm good.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.254
-Play on, player.
-All right, bro.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.690
-See you in the a.m.
-You, too, bro.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.958
-I love you, dude.
-Man, I love me, too.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.026
Good night.

07:13.033 --> 07:16.036
Hey, Care Bear, did you guys
change the WiFi password?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.671
Because I can't connect,
and I have to download

07:17.705 --> 07:19.640
this huge video file
for Dave's set.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.942
Yeah, it's out.
We need someone to fix it.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.712
-Jesus Christ.
-What?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.380
Well, I can't believe him.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.617
MIKE:
Well, I mean, a man should
wash his own car.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.553
-Those things are so expensive
for no re...
-Michael, that's not his car.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.388
His is in the garage.
He's washing the wrong car.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.858
MIKE:
Oh, my God. That's--

07:37.891 --> 07:40.994
I mean, that's embarrassing.
Oh, my-- Look at that.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.063
He's getting in the wheels.
What should we--

07:43.096 --> 07:45.232
-Do you want me to tell him?
I can go stop him.
-No.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.900
Let him waste his fucking time.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.938
-He's making somebody happy.
-(car alarm chirping)

07:50.971 --> 07:53.674
Jesus Christ.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.509
-Michael.
-Yeah.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.579
Where... where did we leave off?

07:58.612 --> 08:00.447
Nineteen.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.916
How do we prevent people

08:02.950 --> 08:05.886
from being scalped
for Dave's tickets?

08:05.919 --> 08:08.121
I promise you

08:08.155 --> 08:11.424
nobody is gonna get scalped
for Dave's tickets.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.994
-Good. That's great.
-Okay? Mm-hmm.

08:14.027 --> 08:18.832
Will-will other rapper artists'
parents be there?

08:18.866 --> 08:21.134
And if so,
do you know their names?

08:21.168 --> 08:26.073
Uh, yeah. Actually, yes, Meek
Mill's parents will be there.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.641
-Meek Mill's?
-Mm-hmm.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.342
Uh, it's Bob and Sharon Mill.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.545
-Bob and Sharon?
-Bob and Sharon Mill.
Yeah, very nice.

08:31.579 --> 08:36.183
All right.
Uh... What is HubStub?

08:37.551 --> 08:39.653
* Walk in the club
with a cape... *

08:39.687 --> 08:41.221
Yo, Philly, how y'all feeling?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.690
(cheering)

08:42.723 --> 08:45.826
Oh, man, I fucking hate this.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.428
Tour manager's got to be with
the artist. You got to be here.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.564
-I'm gonna do work.
-Work?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.566
-Huh?
-You're gonna work in here?

08:52.600 --> 08:53.834
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.835
(whooping)

08:54.868 --> 08:56.236
DAVE:
Oh!

08:56.269 --> 08:59.940
Hi. Cool.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.475
Thank you. You don't have to
keep-- We don't have to--

09:02.509 --> 09:04.211
You're good.
You can just put it down.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.080
ELZ:
Hey, you look like a rapper
right now, low-key.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.650
You don't need to keep dancing.
It's fine. Thank you, though.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.784
ELZ:
This is their job.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.653
They're really gonna just
keep doing this.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.855
-Burd!
-Tuna!

09:14.888 --> 09:17.490
The bunk! The whole camp
is here. Yeah, come in.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.558
Wha...

09:18.592 --> 09:19.993
DAVE:
Ah, man.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.796
-Goddamn. (laughs)
-Hey! Good to see you.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.199
-Looking good, as always.
-Hey, get drinks, get drinks.
Get in here.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.668
Elz, Elz, shift.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.469
Bro, there's no fucking space.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.706
-Just shift.
-Do you think we can fit
more guys in here?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.207
I can't hear you.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.776
Hey, you guys want drinks?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.377
Camp Lebec.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.246
One roof. We're back, baby.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.149
-The bunk is back together.
-(whooping, laughter)

09:42.182 --> 09:43.651
* Came a long way
from a motherfucking O.Z. *

09:43.684 --> 09:45.118
* Hyphy women here talk
to the police *

09:45.152 --> 09:46.987
* Try and move fast,
your shit got it slowly *

09:47.020 --> 09:48.722
* I tell her don't start, B,
don't go at me *

09:48.756 --> 09:50.457
* Ain't never back down
or ran from no beef *

09:50.490 --> 09:52.425
* Nigga, I'm the teacher, how
the hell you gonna coach me? *

09:52.459 --> 09:53.994
* Tell me what you'd do
if I tossed you a ho piece *

09:54.027 --> 09:55.462
* Distract that bitch,
we don't need no bouncer *

09:55.495 --> 09:57.564
* Walk in the club
and stand on the couches *

09:57.597 --> 09:58.899
* You keep on dissing
that fanny pack... *

09:58.932 --> 10:01.534
(gasps)
I'm very drunk.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.271
-I got to move you
to another section.
-What?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.906
BOUNCER:
I have to move you

10:05.939 --> 10:07.440
-to another section.
-Why?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.877
Lil Uzi's coming in.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.613
Okay, where?
Where do you want us to go?

10:13.647 --> 10:15.248
All right.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.884
Nah, fuck that, bro. We ain't
going nowhere, my nigga.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.251
We staying right here, bro.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.787
You supposed to be watching
our back.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.254
Why you got to move us now
when we got comped for bottles

10:21.288 --> 10:22.589
-and shit?
-I ain't even want to talk, man.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.792
We either move now or I'll pick
you up and move you.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.526
You ain't about
to pick nobody up.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.796
Where your fucking owner at?
Where the manager at, bro?

10:28.829 --> 10:31.198
It don't matter where he's at.
I'm doing my job.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.700
Don't be speaking to me like
that, bro. What the fuck

10:32.733 --> 10:33.967
-you talking about?
-I'll talk to him. It's okay,

10:34.001 --> 10:35.602
it's okay, it's okay.
Dude, calm down. Relax.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.470
I can't relax.
Just like you said,

10:37.504 --> 10:39.072
-I'm having fun...
-Uh-- All right,

10:39.106 --> 10:40.808
well, this is a business trip.
You represent me.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.142
All my friends would
love the way I represent.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.777
Nigga, I go hard for my homies.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.713
Are you gonna let him bully us
up out of this section?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.715
-It's not that big of a deal.
-It's that big to me, my nigga.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.950
We in Philly. Nigga,
this is your first show.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.584
-We in the club,
popping bottles, bitches...
-DAVE: All right! All right.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.820
-GATA: What the fuck, bro?
-DAVE: Relax. Relax.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.254
Bro, anybody else
would appreciate

10:54.287 --> 10:55.455
that I'm going this hard
for them.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.656
You acting like a pussy.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.228
All right, we got to go
to a different section.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.630
-Gata's super hood, huh?
-Yeah.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.165
You're fucking white, huh?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.367
-What?
-Yeah, I'll see you in a second.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.635
-Okay?
-Cool.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.639
(chuckles):
I got the Wi-Fi password.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.407
I could care less.
I really have to leave.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.076
I'm so sorry, this is
the worst place on Earth.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.711
Wait, where are they going?
Where's everyone going?

11:17.745 --> 11:19.079
-I don't know.
-Hey, guy, where are you going?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.481
Great.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.683
Do you guys have outlets?
Do you have plugs?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.652
* Smokin' dope and you know... *

11:25.685 --> 11:27.855
I'm telling you,
you've never seen it.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.589
You've never seen a horse
fuck another thing,

11:29.622 --> 11:30.791
like a man?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.125
(exhales):
Ah...

11:32.159 --> 11:35.195
(shouts, coughs)

11:35.228 --> 11:37.697
Yo, you remember when you told
me to put peanut butter

11:37.731 --> 11:40.000
all over Horowitz's bed,
and I did it

11:40.033 --> 11:42.770
not knowing he was allergic
and he almost fucking died?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.772
It was so cool, though.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.540
Man, my fault, Horowitz. I
didn't mean to do it like that.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.309
I forgot how funny you are, bro.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.511
-Why would you do that?
-I didn't mean to.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.946
No reason to do that.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.348
-You are a fucking legend.
-Oh!

11:55.382 --> 11:57.885
-Just say it again in my ear.
-Fucking legend.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.719
-I know. I know.
-TUNA: Yo. Yo.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.189
You should do a Burd Bomb.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.723
-Oh, yes.
-Dude, you've got to.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.359
-You got to.
You got to do it, Burd.
-Dude. Come on!

12:06.393 --> 12:08.528
-Been 15 years.
-In here, though?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.363
-Yes!
-Right here!

12:10.397 --> 12:13.333
-Burd Bomb, dude. Burd Bomb.
-I think so, man.
15 years. You owe us.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.435
-Okay.
-JOSH: You own this place.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.905
Let me get my footing.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.040
-You still got it.
-Okay! Let me look around

12:20.073 --> 12:22.575
and see what's going on
in the club. Let me evaluate.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.377
-Scout everything...
-Okay, come on, man.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.213
-Burd Bomb!
-Well, fuck, all right.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.015
You cool, man?
You good?

12:28.048 --> 12:29.216
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

12:29.249 --> 12:31.651
-Here he goes!
-Yeah.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.187
All right. Fuck it.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.755
It's all you, man.
All you, baby.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.258
-All right. Three...
-GROUP: Two...

12:38.291 --> 12:39.459
One...

12:42.295 --> 12:44.597
-(shouting, excited chatter)
-He's pissing...

12:44.631 --> 12:46.834
(cheering)

12:46.867 --> 12:50.303
-JOSH: He's actually pissing.
-JAKE: Yes.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.439
-Yeah!
-(cheering, laughter)

12:52.472 --> 12:54.207
You...

12:54.241 --> 12:56.709
You guys want me to come?
I'll do it.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.711
-That's okay.
-I'm sending this
to everyone, dude.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.548
-Fuck a bathroom.
-Man, you chilling, bro?

13:01.581 --> 13:04.885
-My man.
-(laughter)

13:04.918 --> 13:06.954
(coughs)

13:06.987 --> 13:08.989
(snoring)

13:11.591 --> 13:12.792
(grunts)

13:15.495 --> 13:17.497
(panting)

13:26.173 --> 13:28.175
(moans softly)

13:34.181 --> 13:36.216
MIKE:
Gata, this is
an $1,800 bill, man.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.985
You better call your guy.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.321
I never said the bottles was
free. I said the table was free.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.755
Well, you can't mention that
after the fact, dude.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.157
That's so shady.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.926
You said the situation
was taken care of.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.962
What do, what do you think
that means?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.964
Uh...

13:50.998 --> 13:53.366
-What the fuck?
-(laughs softly)

13:53.400 --> 13:56.136
If it isn't the guy
who pees on himself.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.406
Oh, I pissed myself at the club.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.941
Oh, my God, I'm still wearing
the same underwear.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.343
That's fucking epic.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.112
Do you have video of it?

14:05.145 --> 14:07.214
Nah, dude, I left. I had to get
away from all those people.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.983
-You left? Why?
-Why?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.885
Bro, I couldn't be around
those dudes for another second.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.320
They're such assholes.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.022
-Who was an asshole to you?
-To me, no one.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.357
But to you, every single person

14:17.390 --> 14:18.959
that we went
to fucking camp with.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.860
Bro, I'm dead serious.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.562
You think I'm joking?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.131
Think about everything
that we've ever done

14:24.164 --> 14:25.132
and been through.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.866
They never fucked with you.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.637
I think you're, like, really
misremembering, like, childhood,

14:30.670 --> 14:31.838
to be quite frank.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.840
They literally idolized me.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.277
-They idolized you?
-Idolized me, yeah.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.546
I'm, like, the most
legendary camper at that camp.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.214
You realize last night
at the club, they made you

14:41.248 --> 14:43.350
pee your pants for their own
personal amusement.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.652
They use you like
a Jackass human, bro.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.188
You're like Steve-O,
but in this shitty form

14:48.221 --> 14:49.889
with no cool tattoos.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.326
I love Steve-O.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.195
Dawg, and the talent show?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.864
You act like that's, like, the
root of your fucking stardom.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.233
No, it's not.
They were making fun of you.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.903
You weren't funny,
you were funny. You get it?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.839
Uh, okay. I don't need a lec--

15:06.873 --> 15:08.041
Like, what are you even
talking about?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.442
DON:
Hey. Morning.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.777
-Wow, Big Don.
-Hey. Hey.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.412
You always look like a million
bucks when I see you.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.780
-Thank you.
-Of course.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.015
Big day.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.683
-Hey.
-Big day. Yeah.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.917
CAROL:
Don?

15:17.951 --> 15:19.219
-Uh-huh?
-What the hell are you wearing?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.721
You're not, you're not
wearing that to the concert.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.892
Well, it's not just any concert,
I'm the father of the rapper.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.427
CAROL (fading):
I've laid out
some clothes for you.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.728
DON:
You laid out what?

15:28.761 --> 15:29.862
CAROL:
I put clothes out on the bed

15:29.896 --> 15:30.930
that I thought would be...

15:30.964 --> 15:32.599
There's no way.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.134
Yeah, it's true.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.536
Your cousin did not
get fingered by bin Laden.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.206
-Yes, she did.
-Isn't he, like, six-five?

15:39.239 --> 15:43.043
-So?
-Yeah, whatever.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.845
JAKE:
Hey, Burd, Kari's coming.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.881
Do a Burd Bomb.
Tell her how much you love her.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.850
-For Kari?
-JOSH: What, you think

15:50.883 --> 15:52.219
she's gonna like you
because you're hot?

15:52.252 --> 15:53.553
(laughter)

15:53.586 --> 15:56.589
Yeah, okay, um,
uh, where are the eggs?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.897
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

16:05.932 --> 16:07.034
Hey, Dave.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.538
Are you okay?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.240
(screams)

16:13.273 --> 16:14.607
(gasps)

16:14.641 --> 16:17.444
(laughter)

16:17.477 --> 16:19.479
Ooh...

16:28.221 --> 16:30.290
All right,
Dicky, you got your, uh,

16:30.323 --> 16:31.691
rider laid out
right here for you.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.327
Wow. Oh, lo mein.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.762
Cool.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.964
Why do you have Lunchables
on your rider?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.399
Why wouldn't I have
Lunchables on my rider?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.034
He-he always loved those.
(chuckles)

16:41.068 --> 16:42.269
Great.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.271
Oh, w-wow. They got tuna fish.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.374
-DAVE: Yeah.
-But, oh,
but there's no can opener.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.842
Hey-hey, Mike, if-if you ask
for something like tuna fish,

16:49.876 --> 16:52.112
do you have to put
something like a can opener

16:52.145 --> 16:53.746
on the rider, as well?
Because,

16:53.780 --> 16:55.882
otherwise, how is
he gonna open the tuna fish?

16:55.915 --> 16:58.151
Yeah, and, uh, I hate
to say this out loud--

16:58.185 --> 16:59.819
I'm a little embarrassed--
but we're not at a level

16:59.852 --> 17:02.389
where we would get
that kind of accommodation.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.292
The big dogs, they get a tuna
guy. We're just not there yet.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.993
Well, I don't know.
I-I don't think it's asking

17:07.026 --> 17:08.628
-too much, really.
-What the hell are you guys
talking about?

17:08.661 --> 17:11.131
-Tuna.
-There's no can opener
for the tuna.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.100
-Well, shit, there should be.
-MIKE: We could do what we do

17:13.133 --> 17:15.202
at home, which is throw it
against the wall until one pops.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.604
Nah, I don't want
to trash the room.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.639
You guys got catering
out the door to the right,

17:19.672 --> 17:21.374
and you have the meet and greet
in half an hour.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.009
-You good?
-Meet and greet. Okay,

17:23.042 --> 17:25.011
I've never done one of those,
but should be easy.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.548
Hey, you want me to bring
any sluts back here?

17:28.581 --> 17:30.550
-You know?
-N-No.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.252
(scoffs)
All good.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.753
All right,
holler if you need me.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.021
-Thanks, man.
-DON: Thank you, sir.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.723
I think we're here really early.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.091
-Don't steal them.
-(stammers)

17:38.125 --> 17:40.727
I'm not steal--
They're here for us to take.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.262
-To eat here.
-I'm gonna run out

17:42.295 --> 17:45.098
to the car and get my thank you
notes and Dave's gift.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.435
-I'll be back.
-Oh, right, right.
Yeah, all right.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.205
So, Elliot,

17:52.239 --> 17:56.008
what made you move out to L.A.?

17:56.042 --> 17:58.211
I mean, what's the story there?

17:58.245 --> 18:01.414
Well, you know me, born
and raised in West Philadelphia.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.916
-Sure.
-Spent most of my days
on the playground,

18:03.950 --> 18:08.054
you know,
chilling, relaxing, cool,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.357
shooting basketball
after school.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.425
You boys love basketball.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.061
But then a couple of guys
who were up to no good

18:15.094 --> 18:17.897
started making trouble all
in my neighborhood and stuff.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.301
I got in one little eensy-weensy
fight and my mom got all scared,

18:21.334 --> 18:25.572
so she moved me out to L.A.
with my uncle in Bel Air.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.208
Oh, I thought you lived
in West Hollywood?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.742
(Dave hacking)

18:33.546 --> 18:34.747
(cheering, applause)

18:35.782 --> 18:37.584
Hey.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.853
How you guys doing? All right,
I'm here to meet and greet.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.522
-Get in here. Yeah.
-Uh, oh, oh, okay.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.757
-Give me a hug. How you doing?
-Okay.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.227
-Uh, uh, can-can
you sign my cast?
-Oh, yeah.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.562
I have a Sharpie, actually,
for this very thing.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.963
Hmm. My signature.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.833
I haven't even figured out
my sig yet.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.268
Let me just...

18:55.302 --> 18:56.903
You know what?

18:56.936 --> 18:58.738
I'm gonna "Command-Z" this
and start over.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.407
That's actually my sister.
She loves you, man.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.041
-Okay, cool.
-Yeah, if you, like,

19:02.074 --> 19:03.610
brought her back
to your trailer,

19:03.643 --> 19:05.912
you could do whatever
you want to her probably.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.247
-(chuckles)
-That's the weirdest...

19:07.280 --> 19:09.316
T-There's, uh,
no need to even...

19:09.349 --> 19:11.651
-Hey, bro. How are you?
-Nice to meet you. Good.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.853
-All right. Yeah?
-No lie, I've killed
to your shit, bro.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.123
-What did you say?
-I've killed to your shit.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.559
What-what the fuck does that
mean? You've killed to my shit?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.494
I'm a sniper in Afghanistan.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.630
-Hey. Hi.
-Why are you guys in this line?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.832
-What the hell are you doing?
-Well, we've met Dave,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.468
-but we haven't met Lil Dicky.
-Here.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.503
What is this?
You brought me a plant? Why?

19:30.537 --> 19:33.139
-It's for good luck.
-It doesn't flower.
-Okay.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.407
Uh, 2-5-6, uh...

19:34.441 --> 19:35.842
-What are you-- I don't...
-3-5, uh...

19:35.875 --> 19:37.109
-9...
-Your cell phone number?

19:37.143 --> 19:39.145
-Y-Yeah.
-Oh, that's of no use to me.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.913
I'm not gonna

19:40.947 --> 19:43.149
-reach out and...
-Yeah...

19:43.182 --> 19:44.284
-Hey, not to be creepy...
-Yeah?

19:44.317 --> 19:45.985
But I think my girlfriend

19:46.018 --> 19:47.854
would like it if you'd sign
my dick. Can you do that?

19:47.887 --> 19:50.089
-What the fuck?
-Will you sign my dick?
Like draw even, like,

19:50.122 --> 19:51.891
-a dick on my dick.
-Definitely not.
Dude, there are so many...

19:51.924 --> 19:53.560
What are you doing?
Pull your fucking pants up.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.295
-What the hell
is wrong with you?
-Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.297
Definitely not gonna sign
your dick right now. No way.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.965
Oh. After?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.167
If you want to stick around
after, meet me in, like,

20:01.200 --> 20:03.470
-where the parking lot area is,
uh, yeah...
-That'd be awesome.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.037
Oh, do the-- do this,
with the-the...

20:05.071 --> 20:07.039
-Mom, really?
It's a small penis.
-Yeah.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.309
-Oh, is that what it is?
-No. No.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.677
I'm a day one Dickhead.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.845
I'm talking
the "Banana Cream Pudding" era.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.147
Oh, my God, you like that song?
That song sucks.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.417
Really? It's just like
all your shit to me, man.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.851
It's just funny.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.227
-Yo, Mike.
-Yo.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.297
-What is this tweet?
-What?

20:30.330 --> 20:32.064
"Hitting the stage soon,
gonna get litty"?

20:32.098 --> 20:34.534
-(chuckles) Yeah, cool.
Is that cool?
-No.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.702
It's, like,
why would you take the liberty

20:35.735 --> 20:37.337
to tweet
before my first concert ever?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.406
I had an entire thing planned.
You just ruined it.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.873
Well, you'd said we can't
let social go dark.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.409
I totally agree with that.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.377
I would have loved
to have had the opportunity

20:44.411 --> 20:46.779
to tweet about
my concert myself.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.416
It's my first concert. Like, I
need to do these things myself.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.850
-Okay.
-And, like, you clearly

20:50.883 --> 20:52.419
don't even have a grasp
of my social voice.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.986
I would never say
anything like that.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.755
I mean, I-- I don't know,
I mean, we do say

20:55.788 --> 20:57.189
some of the same stuff
sometimes, you know?

20:57.223 --> 20:58.691
Like, I--
Well-well, you say "litty."

20:58.725 --> 20:59.892
No, I never say "litty."

20:59.926 --> 21:01.528
-Okay. I...
-And if you ever

21:01.561 --> 21:03.830
want to do something like that,
just check in with me.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.031
-Just be more
communicative. Like...
-Okay.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.033
-Yeah, I had a whole plan.
-Okay.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.568
I will ask permission.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.602
-Okay, thank you.
-Okay.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.103
What is the attitude about?

21:11.137 --> 21:13.806
I don't ha-- Dave,
I don't have an attitude.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.442
You're really hot
right now, so...

21:15.475 --> 21:17.577
-Where are my parents?
-I don't know where your mom is,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.946
but your dad is roaming
the building looking for cake.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.948
-Okay...
-Yo, ho, ho!

21:21.981 --> 21:24.451
-Yo, what up, Burd?
-What's up, dude?

21:24.484 --> 21:26.386
-This is awesome.
-What's up?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.555
-Man, look at this spread.
-What's up, guys?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.789
TUNA:
What? (laughs)

21:29.822 --> 21:30.990
Hey, man. What's going on? Mm.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.692
-Yeah, looks good.
-What's up? Fresh.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.394
-Man, thank you.
-Oof.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.262
What up, Elliot? You too
big-time to say hi to us now?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.898
Pretty much.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.967
-(stifled laugh) My man.
-TUNA: Yo.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.736
Rob's down at will call,
says his name's not on the list.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.838
-Really? Mike. Mike.
-Yeah.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.107
-Yeah.
-Rob?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.642
His name's not
on the list or something?

21:49.676 --> 21:51.277
-He's at will call.
-Yeah, he's not on.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.580
-His name's not
on the list? Okay.
-DAVE: No.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.815
So, can you go deal with that?
Grab him?

21:55.848 --> 21:57.817
I don't know, it's probably
faster, just go grab him.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.352
-You want me to go get him in?
-Yeah, well, yeah. Of course.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.253
-Like...
-Dave, I have, like,
a million things to do

22:01.287 --> 22:03.289
-before the show.
I haven't eaten in, like, a day.
-It's like, I wouldn't

22:03.322 --> 22:05.291
ask you to do this if it was
already, like, properly handled.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.660
-It's part of the job.
Can you just...?
-Okay. I'll-I'll go get him.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.028
-TUNA: Thanks, man.
-Yeah, no doubt, dude.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.498
Hey, uh, you guys
got any Stella here?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.199
I don't know, man.

22:13.232 --> 22:15.001
Like, whatever you see
is what we have.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.603
Well, can you get some?

22:16.636 --> 22:18.037
JOSH:
Dude, it's his show.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.239
He can get us whatever we want.
Come on, Dave.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.641
You can whatever we want.
Are you kidding me?

22:21.674 --> 22:23.075
-Look at this.
-ELZ: Yeah,

22:23.109 --> 22:24.343
Dave will do whatever you want.

22:24.377 --> 22:27.346
(overlapping chatter)

22:27.380 --> 22:29.749
Okay, I need everybody to just
leave the room right now.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.751
Everybody leave.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.420
-Really?
-Us?
-Yeah, I need you guys to leave.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.654
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I need sp-- You came too late.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.923
I need space. Everyone,
please just go. Please go.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.491
All right... Y-You know what,
absolutely. That's right.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.092
You guys-- E-Everyone, get out.
You guys got to get out.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.360
-Let's go.
-I need you to go.
You came too late.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.795
-Like, it's too much.
-JAKE: Okay, we'll handle...

22:42.829 --> 22:44.464
-Please, yeah.
-Well, hey, can I still
get some Stella?

22:44.497 --> 22:45.532
Yeah, I don't know, man.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.933
What the fuck
kind of question is that?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.167
I was just...

22:49.402 --> 22:50.503
MIKE:
Guys, uh, everyone's out.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.571
Let's go.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.205
JAKE:
Can I take the snacks with me?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.842
Hey. Thank you.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.111
Yeah, I-I do need you guys
to go, too, though.

22:59.145 --> 23:02.715
I just, like,
need a minute to myself.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.824
(sighs)

23:15.027 --> 23:17.664
(door closes)

23:17.697 --> 23:22.234
* The sun will explode
and engulf the whole globe *

23:22.268 --> 23:24.871
* We won't even feel it *

23:24.904 --> 23:28.407
* Burn us. *

23:30.409 --> 23:31.911
(applause)

23:31.944 --> 23:34.013
HOST:
Okay.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.749
Thank you everybody
who participated. (chuckles)

23:36.783 --> 23:39.686
(chanting):
We want Burd! We want Burd!

23:39.719 --> 23:42.822
We want Burd! We want Burd!

23:42.855 --> 23:46.258
We want Burd! We want Burd!
We want Burd!

23:46.292 --> 23:48.528
HOST:
All right, well,

23:48.561 --> 23:51.030
whoever this Burd is,
come on up!

23:51.063 --> 23:54.667
We want Burd! We want Burd!
We want Burd!

23:54.701 --> 23:56.402
-Burd is such an idiot.
-He looks so stupid.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.271
-Burd.
-(cheering, applause)

24:04.310 --> 24:05.478
(sighs)

24:05.512 --> 24:07.547
(sighing)

24:13.085 --> 24:15.121
Hey. You got this.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.589
This is what we do.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.191
You seem stressed.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.227
Let me take your mind
off things.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.448
Nothing?

24:42.481 --> 24:46.385
Well, lucky for you, you're just
in time for the 8:15 fart.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.789
All aboard!

24:49.822 --> 24:50.990
(inhales sharply)

24:51.023 --> 24:52.959
Geez, tough crowd.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.461
Playing hardball tonight, I see.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.598
Well, how about this?

25:03.369 --> 25:04.804
(exhales)

25:07.173 --> 25:09.108
That was amazing.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.677
-You liked it?
-Liked it? I loved it.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.746
You put your head in a vat
of lo mein. I was so stressed

25:13.780 --> 25:14.947
before you showed up.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.716
I forgot you're the funniest kid
on the planet.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.585
Would you do it
one more time for me,

25:18.618 --> 25:21.287
just to get my mind off things?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.089
Yeah.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.124

-* Hi, I'm Dave *

28:10.790 --> 28:12.258
* Hi, I'm Dave *

28:15.361 --> 28:16.863
* I am Dave *

28:18.898 --> 28:20.199
-Mom.
-Yes?

28:20.232 --> 28:22.634
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

28:22.668 --> 28:24.871
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

28:24.904 --> 28:28.307
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.049
-(shouting)
-(screaming)

28:38.050 --> 28:40.386
What the hell
is going on out here?

28:41.921 --> 28:43.122
Ta-da!

28:43.155 --> 28:45.724
-Whoo-hoo!
-(splashes)

28:45.758 --> 28:48.660
-(roars)
-You've got 20 seconds
to decide-- arms or legs?

28:48.694 --> 28:50.362
Decide. Decide!

28:50.396 --> 28:52.531

28:59.071 --> 29:00.306
Ow.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.048
Pulling hair is wrong, mate.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.351
I mean, all violence is wrong,
but at least punching's a sport.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.920
-Is it?
-Yes, boxing.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.055
Boxing's in the Olympics.
Hair pulling isn't.

29:17.256 --> 29:17.289
-It would be funny if it was.
-It really would be.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.169
MAN: This is your station.

29:30.202 --> 29:33.272
But... what am I
actually doing here?

29:33.305 --> 29:35.107
I'm not gonna tell you.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.609
Don't worry.
You're gonna figure it out.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.624
Did you call
the speaker of the house
a four-letter word?

29:52.658 --> 29:54.026
-No.
-Are you sure?

29:54.060 --> 29:56.628
Yes, I'm sure.
"Ass" is a three-letter word.
