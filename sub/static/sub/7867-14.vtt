01:11.841 --> 01:13.543
A home and garden show?

01:14.919 --> 01:17.802
Mom, you said we were
going to a video game expo!

01:17.922 --> 01:20.940
You told me we were gonna
pick up trash by the freeway!

01:21.060 --> 01:23.251
You told me something,
but I wasn't listening!

01:23.286 --> 01:24.690
I'm sorry for fibbing.

01:26.275 --> 01:29.998
Tell you what. If you don't like it,
you can complain all the way home.

01:30.118 --> 01:30.886
Fair enough.

01:31.131 --> 01:32.666
Kids, let's practice.

01:34.118 --> 01:35.702
Mi, mi, mi, mi.

01:35.822 --> 01:36.542
Well that's a...

01:36.577 --> 01:38.951
- There's a day we'll never get back.
- I was so bored.

01:39.071 --> 01:42.753
That was good, but Lisa, you're still
complaining from your throat.

01:42.788 --> 01:44.225
Not your diaphragm.

01:44.448 --> 01:47.744
<i>I was so bored</i>

01:51.549 --> 01:55.092
Look! A welcome mat that
tells you you're weight.

01:55.456 --> 01:56.961
<i>Your weight is...</i>

01:57.081 --> 01:58.606
<i>Warranty voided.</i>

01:59.462 --> 02:01.376
Oh, my God! Look over there!

02:01.928 --> 02:04.456
The Sprinkle King, Sprinkle Queen,
and Deluxe Sprinkle King

02:04.491 --> 02:08.600
are the Simon and Garfunkel plus one
of hose nozzle dispersal arrays.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.600
Observe.

02:14.951 --> 02:16.360
Classic hose play.

02:16.606 --> 02:19.492
What is that soothing sound?

02:19.764 --> 02:21.291
Maybe it's beef stew!

02:23.323 --> 02:24.639
Hot tubs!

02:24.759 --> 02:26.402
Guys, what's it like?

02:26.930 --> 02:29.000
Getting a back rub from an orgasm.

02:30.195 --> 02:32.302
I want to buy your fanciest hot tub.

02:32.422 --> 02:35.022
You mean the U-Soup 5000!

02:36.020 --> 02:37.787
Please, can I get it, Marge? Please, please?

02:37.907 --> 02:39.361
I can have all my birthday parties in it!

02:39.481 --> 02:43.000
I'll be less stressed!
And I'm really friggin' stressed!

02:46.665 --> 02:48.874
If I'm more relaxed, I'll be a better mom.

02:49.215 --> 02:50.929
Can we? Can we?

02:51.164 --> 02:52.839
Wait a minute. Who am I pleading with?

02:52.959 --> 02:53.654
- Beats me.
- I don't know.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.405
Please, please, please?

02:58.410 --> 03:02.473
Now I know why lobsters let out that joyful
squeal when they're dropped in the pot.

03:04.237 --> 03:06.644
We're starting to attract swingers.

03:09.811 --> 03:10.557
Yes!

03:12.595 --> 03:13.226
I'm on it.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.140
Go back to your day spas!

03:19.446 --> 03:21.081
Maybe we should get out now.

03:21.116 --> 03:22.664
Interesting proposal.

03:22.699 --> 03:25.645
Now with an opposing point of view, bubbles!

03:31.578 --> 03:33.831
Hey, cool your jets!
We're trying to get to sleep!

03:33.866 --> 03:35.889
Hey, Flanders. Why don't you join us?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.951
Afraid you'll get your mustache wet?

03:38.986 --> 03:39.942
Well, yes.

03:39.977 --> 03:42.158
Come on, man. Baptise your buns.

03:58.153 --> 04:01.302
I feel like we're forgetting something.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.746
There was a note on
the fridge marked urgent.

04:04.866 --> 04:09.572
Funny word, urgent. Urgent. Urgent.

04:09.692 --> 04:11.520
One of us should go look at it.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.485
Probably a reminder to relax more.

04:16.415 --> 04:18.344
- Yeah.
- That's it.

04:28.146 --> 04:29.085
I'm sorry, Abe.

04:29.205 --> 04:31.226
We just can't wait
for your family any longer.

04:31.261 --> 04:35.092
But they're coming. My son even put
a note on his refrigerator.

04:35.127 --> 04:36.105
Please wait.

04:36.225 --> 04:37.444
I'm afraid it's too late.

04:37.763 --> 04:39.303
On your mark, get set.

04:39.585 --> 04:43.038
No!

04:46.647 --> 04:47.524
They're blanks, Abe.

04:56.455 --> 04:57.913
Hey, what happened to the bubbles?

04:58.033 --> 05:00.012
You good-for-nothing jellyfish!

05:00.132 --> 05:03.123
While you were lying here
soaking like a bunch of dirty dishes,

05:03.243 --> 05:07.997
I was lonelier than Estes Kefauver
at a meeting of Murder Incorporated!

05:09.438 --> 05:11.419
That actually makes sense. Look it up!

05:27.721 --> 05:29.730
Sorry we missed your special day, Grampa.

05:29.765 --> 05:31.523
We'll definitely go next year.

05:31.643 --> 05:34.865
The thing is,
I ain't got much life left to live.

05:34.985 --> 05:38.988
And a wasted daylight today
is what I know I'll never get back.

05:39.330 --> 05:43.772
Oh, Dad! I never knew
you had dreams or emotions.

05:43.807 --> 05:45.261
We'll make it up to you.

05:45.381 --> 05:49.359
We'll do something you've always
wanted to do, but never got the chance.

05:49.479 --> 05:54.273
Well, there are a few things I was
hoping to do before I become dust in a jar.

05:54.308 --> 05:56.373
Who said anything about a jar?

05:56.607 --> 05:57.939
Anyway, I made a list.

05:58.888 --> 06:00.015
Okay.

06:00.285 --> 06:01.840
"Things I want to do before I die."

06:01.960 --> 06:03.404
"Pitch in a negro league."

06:03.524 --> 06:05.707
I can at least think of
at least two problems with that.

06:05.942 --> 06:08.346
Can't read that one. My thumb's over it.

06:08.381 --> 06:10.724
"Have one more beer at O'Flanagan's Pub."

06:11.201 --> 06:12.129
We'll do that one.

06:13.426 --> 06:15.281
This place is in Ireland?

06:15.515 --> 06:18.476
That's right.
Now let's make our reservations.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.762
Lousy old man making me
look up at an airplane!

06:26.820 --> 06:30.960
Welcome to Ireland. Also known as
the Emerald Isle, Potatoville, East Boston,

06:31.080 --> 06:34.666
Freckled Bog, the Land of Poetry,
and the Land of Bad Poetry.

06:34.915 --> 06:37.526
And on your left,
you'll see Western Ireland.

06:37.646 --> 06:39.648
On your right, you'll see Kathy Ireland.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.043
Hi, everyone!

06:46.063 --> 06:47.742
I'm finally back.

06:49.154 --> 06:53.617
The days I spent in O'Flanagan's Pub
were the happiest ones of my life.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.291
<i>We drink all day
With all our guilt</i>

06:56.411 --> 06:58.711
<i>We never got *
'Cos we don't wear a kilt</i>

07:01.143 --> 07:03.336
<i>We toss our darts
With a beer in our hand</i>

07:03.456 --> 07:05.837
<i>We boil our food
'Til it tastes really bad</i>

07:06.429 --> 07:13.468
<i>This is the life in Ireland</i>

07:14.335 --> 07:15.320
<i>Ireland</i>

07:37.663 --> 07:42.103
<i>Oh, this is the life in Ireland</i>

07:44.086 --> 07:48.761
Dunkilderry is so quaint. It looks like
the puzzle at the pediatrician's office.

07:50.214 --> 07:52.753
Get ready to step back to a simpler age

07:52.873 --> 07:57.115
filled with tweet calves,
cheerful sheep and unending troubles.

08:01.509 --> 08:02.120
What the--

08:02.742 --> 08:04.552
Upscale boutiques?

08:04.881 --> 08:06.790
Lephrecauns!

08:07.694 --> 08:08.964
...Plasma screen TV.

08:10.693 --> 08:11.353
...Tuscany.

08:11.388 --> 08:14.594
Well Ireland is at the forefront
of Europe's tech boom.

08:19.528 --> 08:21.205
In your face, Belgium!

08:21.325 --> 08:25.196
Bart, if you hate Belgium so much,
maybe I should take your Tintins away!

08:25.432 --> 08:26.665
No, I'll be good!

08:29.287 --> 08:31.847
But my favorite pub is still there.

08:36.888 --> 08:38.645
This isn't the way I remember it!

08:38.990 --> 08:41.073
Where's the customers? Where's the singing?

08:41.193 --> 08:42.900
Where's twenty-year-old me?

08:43.275 --> 08:45.648
Run! Run you big sack of glue!

08:45.683 --> 08:46.957
Tom O'Flanagan?

08:47.349 --> 08:49.162
Quiet! They're in the home stretch now.

08:49.197 --> 08:51.958
Come on, come on. Move your fetlocks!

08:52.915 --> 08:54.829
Dammit! Will you ever win this race?

08:55.135 --> 08:57.605
This broadcast is from 1979.

08:57.725 --> 09:01.365
Yes, I'm just an old man
yelling at me tapes.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.644
I've got lots of time for that now.
No one comes into me bar anymore.

09:06.764 --> 09:10.346
It's been years since
I've sold so much as a "pint."

09:10.381 --> 09:11.553
Don't you mean pint?

09:11.777 --> 09:13.763
It's been so long,
I've forgotten how to say it!

09:13.883 --> 09:17.054
It's a joke to even call
this place a "pube."

09:17.710 --> 09:19.140
What happened, Tom?

09:19.260 --> 09:22.058
Everyone got jobs. That's what happened.

09:22.289 --> 09:26.781
Sir, I brought my father thousands
of miles just to drink at your bar.

09:27.023 --> 09:30.649
Do you mean it? Look, don't toy
with an old man's heart, now.

09:30.769 --> 09:32.398
Give me a beer and a shot of whiskey.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.944
I'll have one drink,
one cocktail and one booze, please.

09:37.983 --> 09:42.095
While your father and your grandfather
have a drink, we're gonna see sites.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.831
Hey, I just spent ten hours on a plane.
I'm staying in here.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.476
They've got German Krusty on TV!

09:57.393 --> 09:59.211
Such a beautiful language.

09:59.331 --> 10:02.004
That's not how a family vacation works!

10:02.232 --> 10:05.747
We do things together while
your father has fun without us.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.842
All right, Tom. Poor me a drink.

10:07.877 --> 10:09.986
We have this delicious Australian shiraz.

10:11.517 --> 10:13.111
An Irish drink!

10:13.231 --> 10:20.452
Oh, fine. Here's some Bushmills whiskey,
served in a potato, floating in a Guinness stout.

10:20.933 --> 10:24.694
Why, you-- I said an Irish drink!

10:25.848 --> 10:27.116
That's better!

10:28.748 --> 10:32.868
"The Giant's Causeway
is a result of a volcanic eruption."

10:33.236 --> 10:36.125
Well, kids.
Isn't that an informational fact?

10:36.536 --> 10:37.545
Kids?

10:39.447 --> 10:40.716
Come back here!

10:54.356 --> 10:57.012
Guinness has been brewed since 1759.

10:57.132 --> 10:58.768
Who would like to know our secret recipe?

10:59.320 --> 11:00.580
I'm not going to tell you.

11:01.868 --> 11:03.834
Sure, if I did, it wouldn't be a secret.

11:05.571 --> 11:06.803
That concludes our tour.

11:15.351 --> 11:19.221
Well. You may know the ingredients,
but you don't know the ratio.

11:19.256 --> 11:20.152
50-50?

11:27.481 --> 11:30.105
At Nick Ellis Island, returning immigrants

11:30.225 --> 11:33.620
who are sick of America
are processed by Irish authorities.

11:33.740 --> 11:34.252
Name.

11:34.372 --> 11:35.130
Frank Smith.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.710
From now on, you're Francis *. Next.

11:37.745 --> 11:40.425
Bill Jones. Seamus Fitzpatrick. Next.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.926
You're Liam Fitzpatrick,
and you're brothers with him.

11:45.363 --> 11:48.204
I said you're brothers!
I didn't say you got along!

11:53.508 --> 11:56.361
They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone,
you get the gift of gab.

11:56.396 --> 11:58.163
Which is great. But I'm not sure I like

11:58.198 --> 12:00.552
the idea of getting
a gift in return for kissing.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.900
What kind of a message
is that for Lisa and Maggie?

12:02.935 --> 12:03.619
Those are my daughters.

12:03.654 --> 12:07.160
But on the other hand, America doesn't
have any stones worth kissing.

12:07.195 --> 12:09.596
Except for Stone Phillips.
Do you have one of him here?

12:09.716 --> 12:11.971
If so, he's our your him.

12:17.687 --> 12:22.027
K-I-S-S M-Y A-S-S spells kiss my ass.

12:26.267 --> 12:26.875
Fresh!

12:28.936 --> 12:31.060
I'm gonna carve me initials in it!

12:33.362 --> 12:34.547
Har, har!

12:35.499 --> 12:42.646
<i>This is the life in Ireland</i>

12:43.944 --> 12:44.787
You okay, Dad?

12:44.907 --> 12:48.343
I just had a nightmare!
That I was back with your mother!

12:51.200 --> 12:53.060
Oh, how I miss her.

12:58.326 --> 12:59.963
Ah, there they are.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.250
Duncle Deli's newest haven keepers.

13:03.109 --> 13:05.413
Last night, you said you never
wanted to leave this pub.

13:05.448 --> 13:07.058
So, you bought it from me.

13:07.290 --> 13:08.191
We what?

13:08.311 --> 13:10.531
All these pictures tell no lies.

13:11.740 --> 13:15.101
There's you meeting with the loan officer,
and the title insurance company.

13:15.136 --> 13:17.253
Here's me replacing the window sashes

13:17.288 --> 13:20.891
that had the termite damage
as per the escrow agreement.

13:21.011 --> 13:23.498
I have to say, for blind drunks,

13:23.533 --> 13:26.634
you had a excellent knowledge
of Irish real estate law.

13:26.962 --> 13:28.653
We bought this dump?

13:28.994 --> 13:31.440
You most certainly did.

13:32.602 --> 13:33.496
What the--

13:39.711 --> 13:41.473
So long, suckers!

13:43.620 --> 13:47.842
Well, Dad. Was there anything on your
list about being cheated by an Irishman?

13:47.877 --> 13:49.232
First one from the bottom.

13:50.979 --> 13:51.502
D'oh!

13:51.537 --> 13:53.027
That takes care of my next one.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.717
Never heard of half this stuff.

14:00.128 --> 14:02.136
This brandy is fifty years old!

14:02.371 --> 14:03.439
Better toss it.

14:04.414 --> 14:07.814
Hey, boy-o! How 'bout a tall cool one?

14:08.754 --> 14:09.971
How 'bout you, green sleeves?

14:10.091 --> 14:11.291
Irishmen love to get drunk.

14:11.411 --> 14:14.166
- I'm in AA.
- Who are you? Stuttering Fonzie?

14:15.539 --> 14:16.887
What about you, bicycle pants?

14:17.007 --> 14:19.638
I'm late for a teleconference
in Hong Kong, you fat gob!

14:25.237 --> 14:26.576
Our first sale.

14:27.609 --> 14:28.932
Our first refund.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.574
Find any customers?

14:31.694 --> 14:33.932
Yeah! Look at them crowding the bar.

14:33.967 --> 14:37.053
There's Sully and Mac, Jimmy D and Jimmy B.

14:37.173 --> 14:39.685
What can I get you boys? The usual?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.243
We are so screwed.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.341
Oh, it must be Bloomsday!

14:47.461 --> 14:48.076
Huh?

14:48.196 --> 14:51.105
Every June 16th, lovers of
James Joyce follow the route

14:51.225 --> 14:53.692
travelled by the Leopold Bloom
in the novel <i>Ulysses</i>.

14:54.638 --> 14:55.851
Let me make a note of that.

14:59.207 --> 15:02.178
What you're saying is,
we've run out of fun things to do.

15:02.298 --> 15:03.162
Pretty much, yep.

15:03.282 --> 15:04.695
There's always something to do in Ireland.

15:04.918 --> 15:07.135
I'm trying to will back a girl
that I met in a music shop.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.095
Watch this, kids.

15:10.532 --> 15:16.797
<i>I don't know you
But I want you</i>

15:17.231 --> 15:18.960
<i>All the mo--</i>

15:19.080 --> 15:21.193
Leave me alone! I have a husband!

15:21.461 --> 15:23.745
And quit sending her pianos!

15:28.461 --> 15:30.770
Ireland doesn't like pubs anymore.

15:31.049 --> 15:35.209
It's as if Danish people stopped
liking sleek modern design.

15:35.329 --> 15:38.133
Bite your tongue!
That will never ever happen!

15:38.405 --> 15:39.390
Well, we need help!

15:39.510 --> 15:45.164
Someone who can make money with a bar
that has no customers and zero charm.

15:48.309 --> 15:51.042
Moe! You shipped yourself here?

15:51.162 --> 15:53.240
No. It's how you fly coach on Delta now.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.916
Moe, something terrible has happened.

15:55.036 --> 15:57.346
The Irish have become
hard-working and sober!

15:57.466 --> 15:59.093
Here's how you turn this place around.

15:59.213 --> 16:03.600
I let people do things in my bar
they can't do nowhere else.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.307
You wanna drink on a Sunday morning,
no problem.

16:06.554 --> 16:07.986
You wanna slow dance with a goat,

16:08.233 --> 16:10.889
I'll be doing a lot of things,
but judging ain't one of them.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.633
Are you saying we should break the law?

16:14.008 --> 16:15.585
The law? That jerk!

16:18.083 --> 16:20.656
What can't people do in modern Ireland?

16:23.837 --> 16:26.785
Well, they're certainly liberal
when it comes to romance.

16:29.776 --> 16:32.458
Sorry, but smoking in pubs
ain't part of the new Ireland.

16:32.493 --> 16:34.094
Also, you can't text while driving.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.995
What has happened to the ways of old?

16:37.289 --> 16:40.127
People can't smoke indoors in Ireland!

16:40.162 --> 16:42.495
Then you let them. Open a smokeasy.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.684
Gentlemen, we have a lot of work to do.

17:00.762 --> 17:02.498
Moe, you were right!

17:02.533 --> 17:06.977
Thanks. Now I'm gonna look for my
grandfather based on this childhood photo.

17:07.012 --> 17:10.223
All I remember about him is he
was part of a complete breakfast.

17:12.472 --> 17:16.903
The day they banned smoking
from pubs, a little bit of Ireland died.

17:16.938 --> 17:21.421
But thanks to these two sweet Yanks,
our lungs are black with joy.

17:21.455 --> 17:23.194
To Homer and his da!

17:23.315 --> 17:25.086
Homer and his da!

17:25.205 --> 17:29.823
Well, Da. It looks like
all your "dur" have come "ter."

17:30.199 --> 17:32.794
My son's first stroke!

17:37.900 --> 17:42.283
Look at all this Euro dough.
These shamrock sure love their tobaccy.

17:43.677 --> 17:46.063
So, it's a smokeasy you're running, then.

17:47.281 --> 17:49.152
So, it's escaping you're thinking of, then.

17:49.187 --> 17:51.356
I can't tell if those
are questions or statements.

17:51.391 --> 17:54.459
So, it's our syntax
you're criticizing, then.

17:54.753 --> 17:56.288
Close her down, boys.

18:10.011 --> 18:11.362
Throw them in the potty wagon.

18:12.695 --> 18:14.098
I mean the us wagon.

18:23.126 --> 18:27.832
Son, this was all my fault. You were
just trying to make an old man happy.

18:27.952 --> 18:30.450
Don't worry, Dad. We'll get out.

18:30.570 --> 18:33.209
America is the New York Yankees
of countries.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.771
Powerful and respected until the year 2000.

18:36.070 --> 18:39.904
Oh, Son. You know how I love a good analogy.

18:40.986 --> 18:41.987
It was apt.

18:42.340 --> 18:44.977
Let me say, I've always admired the Irish.

18:45.012 --> 18:49.331
Knute Rockne, Larry Bird
and especially Mr. Potato Head.

18:49.966 --> 18:50.629
Go on.

18:50.861 --> 18:54.650
But I ask you.
Who does smoking actually hurt?

18:54.770 --> 18:58.854
Except the smokers, those around them,
and the unborn children

18:58.889 --> 19:02.820
of the pregnant women we let in free
on "expecting mothers drink free" night.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.396
So I hope you'll forgive
two well-meaning Americans

19:07.516 --> 19:12.493
for trying to take Ireland back
to the good old days of <i>Angela's Ashes</i>.

19:12.745 --> 19:13.433
Thank you.

19:14.953 --> 19:18.561
That was absolutely terrible.
But fortunately for you,

19:18.596 --> 19:21.809
the policemen fear offences.
Deportation and a small fine.

19:22.197 --> 19:23.362
Thank you, your honor.

19:23.482 --> 19:27.022
And may I say,
I'm glad I could see Ireland again.

19:27.142 --> 19:29.084
Even if it isn't what I remembered.

19:29.388 --> 19:33.531
It got a lot nicer since we sent
all our incompetent half-wits to America.

19:33.651 --> 19:36.135
Where you, for some reason,
made them police officers.

19:37.034 --> 19:38.358
Top of the morning to you.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.915
Chief Clancy Wiggum here to pick up
the Simpsons and take them back to the--

19:42.666 --> 19:43.734
Oh, Jesus.

19:44.145 --> 19:45.888
Better put a little ouchy spray on it.

19:50.736 --> 19:53.294
Boy! I better call for some backup.

19:54.212 --> 19:55.934
This is unit 19--
