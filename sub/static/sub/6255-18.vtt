WEBVTT

00:00.397 --> 00:02.438
I got it, why don't
we rent a bouncy house

00:02.439 --> 00:04.187
for Christine's birthday party?
She'll love that.

00:04.188 --> 00:05.789
Kids love to bounce
up and down.

00:05.823 --> 00:08.492
A recent study showed
that over the past 10 years,

00:08.526 --> 00:12.162
approximately 65,000 children
were treated for injuries

00:12.196 --> 00:14.197
received on bouncy houses.

00:14.232 --> 00:16.433
Listen, you've already put the
kibosh on the kickball party,

00:16.467 --> 00:19.169
the glow-stick party
and the reptile guy.

00:19.203 --> 00:21.605
Who doesn't like reptiles?
I don't see why she needs a party.

00:21.639 --> 00:25.876
Kids just get cake all over
themselves and fight over toy[.

00:25.910 --> 00:27.711
They're little kids;
what could be better?

00:27.745 --> 00:29.045
I mean, don't you remember
your birthday party (sighs)

00:29.080 --> 00:29.980
when you were a little girl?

00:30.014 --> 00:32.314
I never had one.
What?!

00:32.350 --> 00:35.185
Wait a second, you-you never
had a birthday party?

00:35.219 --> 00:37.787
That is correct and
I didn't miss anything.

00:37.822 --> 00:40.457
Okay. Christine is dressed.

00:40.491 --> 00:42.692
I'll drop her off at preschool
on my way to the market.

00:42.727 --> 00:43.693
Thanks, Dad.

00:43.728 --> 00:45.328
Uh, no party, huh?

00:45.363 --> 00:46.530
What?

00:46.564 --> 00:49.466
Booth thinks I was deprived,

00:49.500 --> 00:50.634
because you never gave me

00:50.668 --> 00:52.669
any birthday parties
as a child.

00:52.703 --> 00:54.838
Well, you didn't have
birthday parties,

00:54.872 --> 00:56.673
because that would draw
attention to us

00:56.707 --> 00:59.067
and with the police looking
for us, that's not a good thing.

00:59.076 --> 01:00.043
Right. Unbelievable.

01:00.077 --> 01:01.311
I forgot-- fugitive.

01:01.345 --> 01:02.379
Listen, if I had it
to do over again,

01:02.413 --> 01:03.847
you would have
birthday parties,

01:03.881 --> 01:06.583
but I ca--
I-I can't turn the clock back.

01:06.617 --> 01:09.019
He's right, Booth;
the arrow of time--

01:09.053 --> 01:10.353
(phone ringing)

01:11.756 --> 01:13.189
Brennan.

01:13.224 --> 01:15.025
Oh, okay.

01:15.059 --> 01:16.960
It's coming into the lab?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.128
Dot touch it
until I get there.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.229
(phone beeps)

01:19.263 --> 01:20.830
Dad's taking my car.

01:20.865 --> 01:21.998
I need a ride to the lab.

01:22.033 --> 01:24.334
Remains are coming in.
Sure. I got you.

01:25.903 --> 01:28.238
No party, huh?

01:28.272 --> 01:29.906
W-W-What do you want me to do?

01:29.941 --> 01:32.742
Make a balloon animal
for her now?

01:38.549 --> 01:39.916
A book?!

01:39.951 --> 01:41.818
Yeah. 364 pages.

01:41.852 --> 01:42.886
I never thought I could do it.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.254
And it's a mystery?
Yeah.

01:44.288 --> 01:45.688
Like Dr. B writes?
Yeah. Same genre.

01:45.690 --> 01:46.890
You know,
write what you know.

01:46.924 --> 01:47.824
Wow.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.092
(laughs):
Oh...

01:49.126 --> 01:50.760
The victim is in <i>there?</i>
Mm-hmm.

01:50.795 --> 01:52.929
Okay, that, is awesome.

01:52.964 --> 01:54.230
Wow, it's like
the root system

01:54.265 --> 01:57.167
is pulling apart
the bones.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.802
And there's very little
tissue remaining,

01:58.803 --> 02:01.638
but there should be enough
for a tox screen.

02:01.672 --> 02:02.939
I thought Dr. Brennan
said not to touch it.

02:02.974 --> 02:05.308
But... since
you're the boss,

02:05.343 --> 02:06.343
it doesn't really matter
what she wants.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.711
HODGINS:
Kudzu. Hey, man,

02:07.745 --> 02:09.012
this stuff grows
about a foot a day,

02:09.045 --> 02:10.513
so I should be able
to tell how long

02:10.548 --> 02:12.248
the victim's been in here.
There's staining

02:12.283 --> 02:13.583
and pitting on the bones.
HODGINS: Yeah.

02:13.618 --> 02:14.651
Kudzu excretes

02:14.685 --> 02:15.919
isoflavone aglycones

02:15.953 --> 02:17.754
to break down
the surface of the bone

02:17.788 --> 02:19.589
so the roots can attach.
Hmm.

02:19.624 --> 02:21.758
(leaves rustling)

02:21.792 --> 02:22.726
What was that?

02:22.760 --> 02:24.027
It's still growing.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.696
It's feeding off
the remaining tissue.

02:26.731 --> 02:27.998
I've seen this movie.

02:28.032 --> 02:29.833
It doesn't end well
for humanity.

02:33.571 --> 02:36.439
(leaves rustling)

02:36.474 --> 02:40.543
Look, you shouldn't be upset
with Max is Dr. Brennan isn't...

02:41.646 --> 02:42.979
Oh, God.
It's encased.

02:43.014 --> 02:44.881
It's like the
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

02:44.915 --> 02:46.883
Yeah. The squints are going
to have a field day with that.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.184
But when you're
a little girl,

02:48.219 --> 02:49.486
you should be treated
like a princess,

02:49.520 --> 02:52.055
not some criminal
on the run.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.923
Max was a criminal on the run,

02:53.958 --> 02:55.625
so Dr. Brennan's probably just
sublimated those feelings

02:55.660 --> 02:57.160
as a way to cope.

02:57.194 --> 02:58.995
And now she's just trying to
justify it all by saying

02:59.030 --> 03:00.597
that a kid's birthday party
isn't important.

03:00.631 --> 03:02.365
But it is.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.000
I would imagine so.

03:04.035 --> 03:07.370
I've never been thrown
a party either, so...

03:07.405 --> 03:09.539
You too?

03:09.573 --> 03:11.975
No.

03:12.009 --> 03:12.976
Wow. Yeah.

03:13.010 --> 03:16.513
My dad was a drunk,

03:16.547 --> 03:19.215
and he threw me
a birthday party every year.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.451
The only time I ever
saw him really sober.

03:23.587 --> 03:26.856
It's probably why birthdays
are so meaningful to you.

03:26.891 --> 03:29.092
Tell you what,
why don't you just, you know,

03:29.126 --> 03:30.093
shrink the photos.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.228
Just focus on
what you do best

03:32.263 --> 03:34.064
and I'll get the techs
to go out to the crime scene

03:34.098 --> 03:37.834
and see if they can find any,
uh, tire tracks and footprints.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.703
When we get time of death,

03:39.737 --> 03:41.337
we might be able to
match them up.

03:41.372 --> 03:43.573
Okay.

03:48.846 --> 03:51.748
MONTENEGRO: Okay, this plant is covering
too much of the skull

03:51.782 --> 03:53.283
for me to do
a reconstruction.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.118
Are you going to be able to
remove the vegetation

03:55.152 --> 03:57.520
without compromising
the remains, Dr. Hodgins?

03:57.555 --> 03:59.322
Sort of my thing.

04:00.524 --> 04:02.692
The size of the
second cervical vertebra

04:02.727 --> 04:05.328
indicates the victim was male.

04:05.362 --> 04:07.130
Animal predation appears
to account for

04:07.164 --> 04:08.264
most of the tissue loss.

04:08.299 --> 04:09.966
Yeah, the kudzu
fed on the rest.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.535
Guys, I, I don't even
see the skull.

04:12.570 --> 04:13.970
He's peeking through here,

04:14.004 --> 04:15.905
like an apparition

04:15.940 --> 04:18.475
appearing through a leafy fog.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.709
I beg your pardon,
Dr. Edison?

04:19.744 --> 04:21.978
HODGINS: Clark just finished
writing a book.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.281
It's a mystery,
so you better watch out, Dr. B.

04:25.316 --> 04:27.450
Why? I doubt it will
impact my sales.

04:27.485 --> 04:29.652
Good for you, Clark.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.688
I wouldn't have
thought of you as a writer.

04:31.722 --> 04:34.057
Well, after Nora and I broke up,
I had a lot of free time.

04:34.091 --> 04:35.725
I found, in the evenings,

04:35.760 --> 04:36.860
the words just poured out, so...

04:36.894 --> 04:39.362
Your time is not
free now, Dr. Edison.

04:39.396 --> 04:41.931
Why are you even here,
rather than an intern?

04:41.966 --> 04:43.299
Forensic conference in Buffalo.

04:43.334 --> 04:45.535
The interns got
extra credit if they went.

04:45.569 --> 04:47.070
Yeah, well, everyone
should get extra credit

04:47.104 --> 04:48.304
for going to Buffalo.

04:49.406 --> 04:51.407
Okay, then.

04:51.442 --> 04:52.876
Which I will interpret as,
"Welcome aboard."

04:52.910 --> 04:54.043
Thank you.

04:54.078 --> 04:55.311
The angular eye orbit

04:55.346 --> 04:56.446
indicates the victim

04:56.480 --> 04:57.914
is Caucasian.

04:57.948 --> 04:59.249
The root system seems to have

04:59.283 --> 05:01.584
snaked its way
through every opening.

05:02.586 --> 05:05.188
(leaves rustling)

05:05.222 --> 05:07.323
We need
to remove the skull

05:07.358 --> 05:09.659
before it's damaged.
No problem.

05:09.693 --> 05:12.228
Severing the roots
around the orifices

05:12.263 --> 05:15.431
loosens the kudzu's hold.

05:15.466 --> 05:17.734
See that?

05:17.768 --> 05:20.236
SAROYAN:
Delicate work.

05:20.271 --> 05:23.173
Yeah. Very.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.711
Hey, so are you going to do
Christine's birthday party

05:28.746 --> 05:29.779
at the house, Dr. B?

05:29.814 --> 05:31.748
Please concentrate, Dr. Hodgins.

05:31.782 --> 05:33.216
HODGINS:
Ye of little faith.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.422
The skull is free.

05:39.456 --> 05:40.857
(leaves rustling)

05:42.259 --> 05:43.927
Oh!

05:43.961 --> 05:48.398
That is why I put
no stock in faith!

06:27.825 --> 06:30.727
The root system has crushed
the bones, Dr. Hodgins.

06:30.761 --> 06:32.495
Yeah, and it is still growing.

06:32.529 --> 06:33.930
Well, it might stop,

06:33.964 --> 06:36.199
if we can get out
the remaining tissue and organs

06:36.233 --> 06:37.333
that it's feeding on.

06:37.367 --> 06:38.701
I'm cutting as fast as I can,

06:38.736 --> 06:40.570
but the backseat driving
isn't helping.

06:40.604 --> 06:42.839
Dr. Edison is going to
have a very difficult time

06:42.873 --> 06:45.108
reassembling the remains.

06:45.142 --> 06:46.542
I've already asked for help
from my department.

06:46.577 --> 06:47.844
Here you go.

06:47.878 --> 06:50.880
Ah, a portion of the liver.

06:50.914 --> 06:52.915
The kudzu seemed to love it.

06:52.950 --> 06:55.084
The roots have grown
through the endosteum.

06:55.423 --> 06:57.190
I don't even know what this is.

06:57.224 --> 06:58.825
His prostate.

06:58.859 --> 07:00.927
And it's still
relatively intact.

07:00.961 --> 07:03.530
It is always
the last organ to go.

07:03.564 --> 07:05.799
Does that mean that you can
determine time of death?

07:05.833 --> 07:07.634
Well, if the body's
been outside since death,

07:07.668 --> 07:09.636
decomp would indicate
at least six days.

07:09.670 --> 07:11.951
Well, given the rate of growth
of the kudzu, I'd say nine.

07:11.972 --> 07:13.706
Eight?
Yeah. Deal.

07:13.741 --> 07:16.976
I'm gonna run this tissue
for DNA and run a tox screen.

07:23.017 --> 07:25.385
According
to these pictures,

07:25.419 --> 07:27.687
looks like he pulled
right up the embankment, huh?

07:27.721 --> 07:30.523
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and look,
there are no footprints

07:30.558 --> 07:33.193
between where the car pulled up
and where the body was found.

07:33.227 --> 07:34.794
So, what-what,
he got out of his car, right?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.396
His feet didn't
leave the asphalt,

07:36.430 --> 07:38.631
probably because he was afraid
he was gonna be seen

07:38.666 --> 07:40.467
and he dumps the body
as quickly as possible.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.862
We're dealing with
an amateur here.

07:41.869 --> 07:43.603
He would have picked
a more secluded spot.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.573
Chances are, the killer
was horrified by what he did.

07:46.607 --> 07:48.775
Yeah. Mm.

07:48.809 --> 07:50.276
So you gonna...

07:50.311 --> 07:53.046
you gonna let Dr. Brennan
help plan the party?

07:53.080 --> 07:54.781
(tapping on table)

07:54.815 --> 07:56.349
I will.

07:56.383 --> 07:58.485
It would make her feel like
a princess if she did.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.886
(groans quietly)

07:59.920 --> 08:02.055
Right.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.924
That didn't go over well.

08:08.129 --> 08:09.929
Here are a few more
clean bones for you.

08:09.964 --> 08:11.297
Oh, thank you.

08:11.332 --> 08:14.434
These clean bones
are really  making

08:14.468 --> 08:16.236
reconstruction a lot easier.

08:16.270 --> 08:18.338
So far, I know that
the victim suffered

08:18.372 --> 08:20.273
sharp force trauma
to the parietal;

08:20.307 --> 08:22.609
the cross-shaped fractures
indicative of someone

08:22.643 --> 08:23.943
that was struck from the left

08:23.978 --> 08:25.378
with a hard-shaped object.

08:25.412 --> 08:27.247
So, a fight with a lefty
before he was killed?

08:27.281 --> 08:28.982
Yeah.
Looks that way.

08:29.016 --> 08:32.085
You know, this might end up
being a very exciting case.

08:32.119 --> 08:33.453
Perhaps it was about love,

08:33.486 --> 08:34.921
or money,

08:34.955 --> 08:36.289
or love <i>and</i> money, or--

08:36.323 --> 08:37.756
Easy does it there,
Mr. Dickens.

08:37.791 --> 08:39.058
Sure. You know,
I would love

08:39.092 --> 08:40.894
for you to read
what I just finished.

08:40.928 --> 08:43.062
I mean, I've already
submitted to a publisher,

08:43.097 --> 08:45.398
but of course,
I can make changes.

08:45.432 --> 08:47.600
Yeah. Sure.

08:54.508 --> 08:57.010
BOOTH: <i>DNA said the victim</i>
<i>is Joe Starkel.</i>

08:57.044 --> 08:59.546
So the victim's brother works
for Merryvale Productions--

08:59.580 --> 09:01.014
they make TV shows.

09:01.048 --> 09:02.448
Apparently, the victim
used to work there too.

09:02.483 --> 09:05.451
What about a storyteller
for the children?

09:05.486 --> 09:07.487
I have the number of an
excellent one to call.

09:07.521 --> 09:08.821
That sounds promising.

09:08.856 --> 09:10.456
I know!
Yeah.

09:10.491 --> 09:12.859
He tells environmental tales

09:12.893 --> 09:15.228
about species who are dying

09:15.262 --> 09:16.696
on the Great Barrier Reef.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.331
What? No. No. No. No. No.

09:18.365 --> 09:20.466
That sounds awful.
It's educational and poignant.

09:20.501 --> 09:22.335
What's awful about that?
The words

09:22.369 --> 09:24.237
"educational" and "poignant."

09:24.271 --> 09:25.605
Just leave it to me, Bones.

09:25.639 --> 09:27.740
I'm going for fun
and more fun.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.610
A lot of fun. Trust me.

09:36.383 --> 09:38.017
Mr. Starkel
and the other performers

09:38.052 --> 09:39.452
are about to start
shooting a scene.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.753
He's the actor in green.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.255
Thanks.

who they are?

10:13.087 --> 10:14.954
These are the
Veggie-Ta-Bills.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.357
Christine <i>loves</i> these guys.
Loves the show.

10:17.391 --> 10:17.825
She does?

10:17.850 --> 10:19.359
What, do you really think
that she's eating broccoli

10:19.360 --> 10:20.994
'cause you told her
there's a pint of fiber in it?

10:21.028 --> 10:22.428
3.8 grams, as well as

10:22.463 --> 10:25.131
20 percent of her
vitamin A requirements.

10:25.165 --> 10:27.200
Not to mention,
an abundance of--

10:27.234 --> 10:28.935
These are the Veg-Ta-Bills.

10:28.969 --> 10:30.470
They're vegetables
that are all named "Bill."

10:30.504 --> 10:32.305
Corn is a fruit,
not a vegetable.

10:32.339 --> 10:33.906
That's not true,
that's not true.

10:33.941 --> 10:35.541

We can do better.

11:02.603 --> 11:04.037
That was great.
It was great, great.

11:04.071 --> 11:06.272
Carrots, corn
and broccoli-- my man.

11:06.307 --> 11:08.241
Who are you?

11:08.275 --> 11:10.043
We're with the FBI.
Show him your badge.

11:10.077 --> 11:11.110
Bones, wait till we...

11:11.145 --> 11:12.445
We're here to
inform you

11:12.479 --> 11:14.013
that your brother has
been murdered.

11:15.783 --> 11:18.151
And that corn is
not a vegetable.

11:20.387 --> 11:21.387
Oh, my God.

11:21.422 --> 11:22.588
I'm just talking...

11:22.971 --> 11:24.485
I can't believe Joe is dead.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.014
Do you know how
it happened?

11:26.048 --> 11:27.682
We don't know
all the details yet.

11:27.716 --> 11:30.785
He was discovered being devoured
by a patch of kudzu

11:30.820 --> 11:32.620
along the side
of State Route 32.

11:32.655 --> 11:34.189
Really?

11:34.223 --> 11:35.890
What?
You don't follow the...?

11:35.925 --> 11:37.776
Oh, God!
This is awful.

11:37.777 --> 11:39.689
Can you think of anyone who'd want
to hurt your brother?

11:39.728 --> 11:41.229
No. He was a wonderful guy.

11:41.263 --> 11:43.131
He was the best man
at our wedding.

11:43.165 --> 11:44.799
Wait a second--
if your brother

11:44.834 --> 11:46.901
was Carrot Bill,
who-who's that?

11:46.936 --> 11:49.704
That's Tommy. When Joe left,
we had to find a replacement.

11:49.738 --> 11:51.840
If Joe created the show,
why did he leave?

11:51.874 --> 11:53.408
He was working on developing
a new show--

11:53.442 --> 11:55.009
<i>Mirthquake Village.</i>

11:55.044 --> 11:57.045
So you weren't upset
that your brother left?

11:57.079 --> 12:00.281
Sure-Sure, I was, at first.
They're brothers.

12:00.316 --> 12:01.883
Brothers fight, right?

12:01.917 --> 12:04.586
When was the last time
either one of you saw him?

12:04.620 --> 12:05.887
It's been a couple months.

12:05.921 --> 12:07.388
He's pretty busy
with his new show.

12:07.423 --> 12:09.224
Look, we may have
some more questions for you.

12:09.258 --> 12:10.792
If you're thinking about
leaving town,

12:10.826 --> 12:13.328
I suggest you call that number first--
that's me.

12:13.362 --> 12:15.563
Okay.

12:19.368 --> 12:21.769
You have something
for me, Dr. Edison?

12:21.804 --> 12:24.105
Yes.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.407
I would like you
to read my book.

12:26.442 --> 12:28.309
Dr. Hodgins is,
and I would, uh, like

12:28.344 --> 12:30.211
to give you
the chance as well.

12:30.246 --> 12:32.313
You know what? I am very busy.

12:32.348 --> 12:34.816
Wouldn't Dr. Brennan be
a better judge of your work?

12:34.850 --> 12:36.417
I mean, she's a writer, too.

12:36.452 --> 12:39.053
Mm, I'd rather get feedback
from readers.

12:39.088 --> 12:41.923
After all,
that's who I wrote it for.

12:41.957 --> 12:44.392
We should probably finish
the case first,

12:44.426 --> 12:46.761
and then I'll try to get to it.

12:46.795 --> 12:48.630
Great. Now speaking of which,

12:48.664 --> 12:51.533
I found remodeled fractures on
the radius and ulna of both arms

12:51.567 --> 12:54.102
as well as the right fifth
and eighth ribs.

12:54.136 --> 12:56.671
Remodeling suggests that it was
sustained about eight weeks ago.

12:56.705 --> 12:58.873
A fight?
Yes.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.608
His brother said
everybody loved Joe.

13:00.643 --> 13:02.043
I guess that wasn't the case.

13:02.077 --> 13:04.312
Anything on cause of death yet?
No, not yet.

13:04.346 --> 13:05.547
Okay.

13:05.581 --> 13:07.081
Dr. Saroyan...

13:07.116 --> 13:10.318
you... forgot my book.

13:11.353 --> 13:14.522
I look forward
to your thoughts.

13:16.725 --> 13:18.526
Of course.

13:20.396 --> 13:22.430
Okay, check this out.
I found the perfect thing

13:22.464 --> 13:23.565
for Christine's birthday party.

13:23.599 --> 13:25.900
Ronnie the One-Man Band?

13:25.935 --> 13:27.735
Yes! The one-man band!

13:27.770 --> 13:30.772
Show me one person that doesn't
like a one-man band.

13:30.806 --> 13:32.006
I'm sure many
don't like them,

13:32.041 --> 13:33.675
which is why
they're such a rarity.

13:33.709 --> 13:36.544
Help me out here, Sweets.
You like the one-man band?

13:37.880 --> 13:40.048
I think this is really
between the two of you.

13:40.082 --> 13:41.783
Come on. You know how hard
Christine laughs

13:41.817 --> 13:43.051
when she watches <i>Mary Poppins</i>

13:43.085 --> 13:44.686
and Dick Van Dyke,

13:44.720 --> 13:46.955
you know,
doing the one-man band.

13:46.989 --> 13:50.124
(mimics percussion)

13:50.159 --> 13:52.193
That is true.
True.

13:52.228 --> 13:53.595
(text alert sounds)

13:53.629 --> 13:55.663
Oh, you got a text here
from Cam.

13:55.698 --> 13:58.266
"Joe Starkel was in a serious
fight about eight weeks ago."

13:58.300 --> 13:59.968
That's when he was doing
his new show.

14:00.002 --> 14:03.471
Maybe someone on that show knows
who fought with him.

14:05.274 --> 14:06.941
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>
<i>You're saying</i>

14:06.976 --> 14:08.243
Joe Starkel is dead?

14:08.277 --> 14:09.957
Well, he got into a fight
a few months ago,

14:09.979 --> 14:11.946
when he was working here.
Do you know anything about that?

14:11.981 --> 14:13.848
No. Uh, he was
pretty irritable, though,

14:13.882 --> 14:16.651
because <i>Mirthquake Village</i>
didn't turn out to be very good.

14:16.685 --> 14:18.052
Look, I told Joe,
real nice,

14:18.087 --> 14:19.721
I was pulling the plug.

14:19.755 --> 14:21.623
It's tough for a one-hit wonder
to accept the truth,

14:21.657 --> 14:24.959
you know what I mean?
Jake, we need to talk.

14:24.994 --> 14:28.363
I'm a little busy.
These nice people are with the FBI.

14:28.397 --> 14:30.164
It'll just be a minute.

14:30.199 --> 14:32.233
My character would never
wear a crocodile belt.

14:32.268 --> 14:33.434
Why the hell not?

14:33.469 --> 14:34.769
You're a crocodile cowboy.

14:34.803 --> 14:37.038
It's sick,
a croc wearing croc.

14:37.072 --> 14:38.973
Would you wear
a human belt?

14:39.008 --> 14:41.169
I agree with the crocodile.
Okay, Bones, that's enough.

14:41.176 --> 14:43.544
Listen, you wouldn't happen
to know a Joe Starkel?

14:43.579 --> 14:44.946
Oh. Oh, is that
what this is about?

14:44.980 --> 14:47.248
Yeah.
Is he finally filing charges, Jake?

14:47.283 --> 14:48.349
Wear whatever the hell you want.

14:48.384 --> 14:49.864
Just let me finish up here.
I'm sorry.

14:49.885 --> 14:50.885
Charges? What charges?
I don't know

14:50.919 --> 14:52.253
what he's babbling about.

14:52.288 --> 14:53.554
CROCODILE COWBOY: Well, it's
no great secret, Jake.

14:53.589 --> 14:55.223
Jake here and Joe,
they got into it

14:55.257 --> 14:57.134
when Jake pulled the plug
on <i>Mirthquake.</i>

14:57.159 --> 14:57.859
Really?

14:57.860 --> 15:00.028
A little tiff.
BRENNAN: His injuries were extensive.

15:00.062 --> 15:02.597
You fractured his ribs,
mandible, zygomatic.

15:02.631 --> 15:03.931
Funny how that slipped
your mind.

15:03.966 --> 15:05.166
Joe started it.
He freaked when

15:05.167 --> 15:06.734
I told him I didn't
want to do his show.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.303
He came at me swinging.
I defended myself.

15:08.337 --> 15:09.904
I was standing my ground.

15:15.077 --> 15:16.711
SAROYAN:
So, how's it coming?

15:16.745 --> 15:19.280
Actually, the detergent
I used to loosen the vines

15:19.315 --> 15:21.949
from the bones cleaned off a ton
of very interesting stuff.

15:21.984 --> 15:23.818
And what did you find?

15:23.852 --> 15:26.212
Well, so far, I found some motor oil
that was on the victim.

15:26.221 --> 15:28.256
And I'll try to match that
to a specific car.

15:28.290 --> 15:31.392
I also found a mixture
of limestone, clay,

15:31.427 --> 15:32.994
fly ash, and gypsum.

15:33.028 --> 15:34.529
Oh, uh, Portland cement.

15:34.563 --> 15:36.331
It's my job to determine that,

15:36.365 --> 15:37.999
but you are absolutely right.

15:38.033 --> 15:39.567
And I'm thoroughly impressed.

15:39.601 --> 15:41.302
So what does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.

15:41.337 --> 15:42.570
Could be a construction site.

15:42.604 --> 15:44.472
But I believe
the answer is in the runoff.

15:48.243 --> 15:50.812
Have you, uh, started
the book yet?

15:50.846 --> 15:52.313
No. I am so nervous.

15:52.348 --> 15:54.982
I mean, what if it stinks?

15:55.017 --> 15:57.151
But it could be great, right?

16:00.923 --> 16:03.124
MONTENEGRO
<i>I just found out that</i>

16:03.158 --> 16:04.592
the producer Starkel
fought with

16:04.626 --> 16:06.561
was out of the country
when he was killed.

16:06.595 --> 16:08.663
But I think that I have
a new suspect.

16:08.697 --> 16:10.698
So, this is Carrot Bill's
Twitter account.

16:10.733 --> 16:12.600
SWEETS:
You mean Joe Starkel.

16:12.634 --> 16:14.402
No. This is the carrot's.

16:14.436 --> 16:15.837
You'd be surprised about

16:15.871 --> 16:17.972
how many adult fans
there are of the show.

16:18.006 --> 16:19.507
Like this woman,
Debra Ann Volker.

16:19.541 --> 16:24.879
Her Twitter handle is
SuperVeggieFanXOXO.

16:24.913 --> 16:27.382
Carrot Bill was blocking her
direct messages.

16:27.416 --> 16:29.283
"I rely on you to guide my life.

16:29.318 --> 16:32.186
"I trust in you. Everything I am
is because of you."

16:32.221 --> 16:33.621
Okay, this is a woman

16:33.655 --> 16:34.956
that's showing signs
of being obsessed.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.891
Well, that's just
the beginning.

16:36.925 --> 16:38.593
Flash forward to just after
Starkel left the Veg-Ta-Bills.

16:38.627 --> 16:40.828
"I gave you everything.
You let me down.

16:43.799 --> 16:47.034
"You will rot in hell,
and I will make it happen." Wow.

16:47.069 --> 16:50.171
She sent over 50 tweets
in a 48-hour period,

16:50.205 --> 16:53.241
and this was the week
before Starkel was killed.

16:53.275 --> 16:55.076
Look at this picture
she posted.

16:56.278 --> 16:58.513
What, she Photoshopped
herself into that?

16:58.547 --> 17:00.148
It's crazy, right?

17:00.182 --> 17:01.449
Uh, a grown woman

17:01.483 --> 17:03.251
obsessed with a giant orange
phallic symbol?

17:03.285 --> 17:06.753
Yeah, I'm comfortable
calling her crazy.

<i>Carrot Bill dead?</i>

17:17.992 --> 17:18.763
I can't believe it.

17:18.765 --> 17:20.332
He was the best
vegetable.

17:20.367 --> 17:21.834
Okay, you do realize

17:21.867 --> 17:23.636
that Carrot Bill is
a fictional character?

17:23.670 --> 17:26.638
Joe Starkel is the man that died.
I know.

17:26.673 --> 17:28.574
I'm not insane, Dr. Sweets.

17:28.608 --> 17:30.543
Shrinks always look for
the crazy in everything.

17:30.577 --> 17:33.712
I watch the Veg-Ta-Bills
with my six-year-old son.

17:33.747 --> 17:36.448
To him, the carrot is real.

17:36.483 --> 17:39.285
Right. Did you send these
to Joe Starkel?

17:39.319 --> 17:43.656
I'm kind of a
Twitter freak, I guess.

17:43.690 --> 17:45.291
That's a bit
of an understatement.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.860
Uh, "I want to peel you
out of your carrot suit

17:47.894 --> 17:49.328
and eat you raw."
Okay, okay,

17:49.362 --> 17:51.564
my son wasn't the only one
who liked the show.

17:51.598 --> 17:53.399
But you know what
happens online.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.534
You're anonymous,
so you say things

17:55.569 --> 17:56.869
that you wouldn't face-to-face,
right?

17:56.903 --> 17:58.938
There are hundreds
of these messages.

17:58.972 --> 18:00.506
I mean, it starts

18:00.540 --> 18:02.474
with autograph requests
and it moves on

18:02.509 --> 18:04.109
to wanting to meet,

18:04.144 --> 18:07.313
and then the stuff about
eating his carrot.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.481
I mean, that's-that's,
cyberstalking, Ms. Volker.

18:09.516 --> 18:11.417
Maybe I went a little overboard,

18:11.451 --> 18:14.153
but that show changed
my life as much as my son's.

18:14.187 --> 18:16.488
I was overweight,
eating junk,

18:16.523 --> 18:20.159
I had high blood pressure,
and-and sleep apnea...

18:20.193 --> 18:23.762
but because of Carrot Bill,

18:23.797 --> 18:26.899
I went from this,
to what you see now.

18:26.933 --> 18:29.468
He saved my life
and my career.

18:29.502 --> 18:33.138
I sell beauty products,
which is very hard to do

18:33.173 --> 18:34.840
when you're 80 pounds
overweight.

18:34.874 --> 18:36.375
That is quite a change.
Well, I was

18:36.409 --> 18:39.111
terrified of putting this weight
back on when he left the show.

18:39.145 --> 18:40.879
So you saw the group
as kind of a talisman

18:40.914 --> 18:42.481
for your good fortune then.

18:42.515 --> 18:45.184
I've always been a little
superstitious, I guess.

18:45.218 --> 18:46.685
Have you always threatened
people?

18:48.455 --> 18:51.223
Why would I kill him?

18:51.257 --> 18:54.727
Why? He changed my life.

18:56.997 --> 19:00.766
How are you doing with
Joe Starkel's e-mails?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.635
He deleted
most of them using

19:02.669 --> 19:04.937
a multi-pass system
used by the DoD.

19:04.971 --> 19:07.339
Sounds like he was
hiding something.

19:07.374 --> 19:09.008
I guess we'll never know.

19:09.042 --> 19:11.377
Well, maybe not.
I might be able to use

19:11.411 --> 19:13.490
a magnetic force microscopy

19:13.515 --> 19:15.848
to recover film fragments
and piece them together.

19:15.849 --> 19:17.891
Did you get anything else
from the tox screens?

19:17.916 --> 19:18.584
Nope.

19:18.585 --> 19:21.854
He was one
clean-living carrot.

19:21.888 --> 19:23.022
Clark's book?

19:23.056 --> 19:26.125
I only got through
two chapters.

19:26.159 --> 19:27.359
Pretty painful stuff.

19:27.394 --> 19:29.728
Two pages of the sun setting
over the remains

19:29.763 --> 19:31.063
of an itinerant stock broker.

19:31.097 --> 19:34.566
So I found traces of asphalt
with the concrete and oil.

19:34.601 --> 19:37.136
I think the injuries might have
taken place in a parking lot.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.637
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, great.

19:38.672 --> 19:40.739
So that narrows down
the murder site

19:40.774 --> 19:42.408
to, like, a million places.
HODGINS: Wow.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.542
Snarky.

19:43.576 --> 19:46.011
Oh, the book got you down?

19:46.046 --> 19:49.048
Ooh... (clears throat)

19:49.082 --> 19:52.451
"Death had never looked so dead
as the death

19:52.485 --> 19:53.852
"now in front of them,

19:53.887 --> 19:55.754
"all life drained,

19:55.789 --> 19:58.390
only death covering
the dead."

19:58.425 --> 20:00.693
You think the victim
was dead?

20:00.727 --> 20:02.494
Please, I couldn't
even get past chapter one.

20:02.529 --> 20:03.929
Remember this?

20:03.963 --> 20:07.433
"McDonald's farm was
nestled in a glen,

20:07.467 --> 20:09.868
perfect for the final days
of an old man."

20:09.903 --> 20:13.439
Old McDonald had a farm?
Really? Seriously?

20:13.473 --> 20:14.506
What are we gonna tell him?

20:14.541 --> 20:15.541
We're gonna
tell him the truth.

20:15.575 --> 20:17.242
That I've never read anything
like it.

20:17.277 --> 20:19.778
MONTENEGRO: Oh, that's good.
Yeah.

20:19.813 --> 20:22.181
It's, uh, one of a kind.

20:22.215 --> 20:24.516
HODGINS: Absolutely.
What's one of a kind?

20:24.551 --> 20:26.685
Oh, uh, your book.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.555
I've never read
anything like it.

20:29.589 --> 20:31.123
HODGINS:
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.157 --> 20:33.726
You know, I've been very busy
with the case,

20:33.760 --> 20:37.129
so I've only gotten
through chapter one,

20:37.163 --> 20:39.098
but so far,
it is just...

20:39.132 --> 20:41.700
(laughs) I mean...

20:41.735 --> 20:43.035
Whew!

20:43.069 --> 20:44.770
Well, you know, my feeling is,

20:44.804 --> 20:47.206
if the writer doesn't hook
a reader in chapter one,

20:47.240 --> 20:48.507
he's not doing his job.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.576
Look, I just don't
want compliments.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.544
I can take criticism.

20:52.579 --> 20:53.879
Of-Of course.

20:53.913 --> 20:54.680
Sure.

20:54.714 --> 20:55.814
You-you got it.

20:55.849 --> 20:57.182
Okay, great. Now, um... oh.

20:57.217 --> 21:00.319
I found some additional
remodeled injuries,

21:00.353 --> 21:02.154
uh, this time to
the sternum and lower ribs.

21:02.188 --> 21:03.989
More recent than from
the fight with the producer.

21:04.023 --> 21:05.891
You know,

21:05.925 --> 21:07.359
I hope we solve this soon

21:07.393 --> 21:09.094
so you can all finish reading.

21:09.129 --> 21:10.229
Me, too.
Can't wait!

21:11.231 --> 21:12.397
Chapter two awaits.

21:12.432 --> 21:14.700
Right, right.
(laughs)

21:16.469 --> 21:19.204
MAX: It's so nice
to have coffee with you.

21:19.239 --> 21:20.439
We never to do this.

21:20.473 --> 21:21.974
BRENNAN:
I know.

21:22.008 --> 21:24.910
(Max sighs happily)

21:24.944 --> 21:27.880
But something tells me this
is about more than coffee.

21:30.383 --> 21:31.884
It's Christine's party.

21:31.918 --> 21:33.185
Booth is taking
care of it

21:33.219 --> 21:35.020
and that makes me
uncomfortable,

21:35.054 --> 21:37.489
because I have no
frame of reference

21:37.524 --> 21:40.025
for an important event
in my daughter's life.

21:40.059 --> 21:41.360
Oh, honey...

21:41.394 --> 21:42.861
it wasn't that bad.

21:42.896 --> 21:45.931
I mean, your mother
and I did all we could.

21:45.965 --> 21:48.167
You could have lived
an honest life, Dad.

21:49.202 --> 21:51.904
You know, sometimes
circumstances

21:51.938 --> 21:53.872
move your life
in a direction

21:53.907 --> 21:56.041
you never thought
it would go.

21:58.611 --> 22:01.113
What are you implying?

22:01.147 --> 22:03.549
Well, your mother and I,

22:03.583 --> 22:06.218
we never intended
to live outside the law.

22:07.754 --> 22:09.388
I don't understand.

22:09.422 --> 22:10.789
Then why did you?

22:18.131 --> 22:20.265
I can't tell you why.

22:21.501 --> 22:24.069
Not yet.

22:24.103 --> 22:26.939
Certain people are out there...

22:26.973 --> 22:29.107
still alive...

22:29.142 --> 22:31.076
could get hurt.

22:34.347 --> 22:36.348
And after all I've done,

22:36.382 --> 22:38.951
I don't want
to hurt anyone else.

22:42.922 --> 22:45.457
That's not a real answer.

22:46.492 --> 22:48.894
I... I know,

22:48.928 --> 22:51.797
but you're just going
to have to trust me.

22:53.299 --> 22:56.134
It's not easy, Dad.

22:59.505 --> 23:01.306
I'm sure it isn't.

23:02.942 --> 23:05.577
But when all is
said and done, honey,

23:05.612 --> 23:07.880
your childhood
wasn't so bad.

23:07.914 --> 23:10.983
You used to love playing tag
when you were a kid.

23:12.185 --> 23:14.086
Think back.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.188
Come on.
You loved it.

23:16.222 --> 23:18.190
And you... and you
always got me.

23:18.224 --> 23:19.491
(laughs)

23:19.525 --> 23:20.893
I mean, you could...

23:20.927 --> 23:22.794
you-you would fade to your right

23:22.829 --> 23:25.898
and then, suddenly, you would
slash through to your left...

23:25.932 --> 23:27.866
Y-You could've played football.

23:29.002 --> 23:31.236
I can still
hear you laughing

23:31.271 --> 23:33.472
and squealing with joy

23:33.506 --> 23:35.607
every time you got me.

23:40.213 --> 23:41.313
Isn't that

23:41.347 --> 23:45.117
reference enough
for you to...

23:45.151 --> 23:47.786
to give Christine
a good birthday?

24:06.105 --> 24:07.572
BOOTH:
<i>So what is the verdict?</i>

24:07.607 --> 24:09.641
Okay? Is Debra Ann Volker
capable of murder?

24:09.676 --> 24:11.843
Well, she definitely
suffers from

24:11.878 --> 24:13.345
celebrity
worship syndrome.

24:13.379 --> 24:14.713
Celebrity worship syndrome?
What is that?

24:14.747 --> 24:16.548
Is that even a real thing?
Yeah.

24:16.582 --> 24:18.750
It's an obsessive-addictive
disorder. I'll get you

24:18.785 --> 24:20.619
the literature on it, if you want.
Nah, I'll take your word for it.

24:20.653 --> 24:22.721
So is she a killer?
Volker's tweets definitely

24:22.755 --> 24:24.356
place her at the borderline

24:24.390 --> 24:25.624
of pathological behavior.

24:25.658 --> 24:26.825
And since there's

24:26.859 --> 24:28.293
no cause of death,
we have nothing

24:28.328 --> 24:31.029
to link her,
except that she's a wacko.

24:31.064 --> 24:32.931
Well, wackos are kind of my thing.
Yeah, well,

24:32.966 --> 24:34.666
evidence is my thing, Sweets.
You know that. (phone ringing)

24:34.701 --> 24:36.868
Hold on.
Ooh! It's Ronnie!

24:36.903 --> 24:39.204
Who's Ronnie?
Hey!

24:39.238 --> 24:40.672
Ronnie! Yeah!
Who's Ronnie?

24:40.707 --> 24:41.974
Thanks, bud, for
getting back to me.

24:42.008 --> 24:43.408
He's a one-man-band.
Oh...

24:43.443 --> 24:44.743
Okay. Now? Great.

24:44.777 --> 24:46.111
He's going to play
a song for us.

24:46.145 --> 24:47.879
Now?
Yeah, li...

24:47.914 --> 24:50.282
(whimsical music playing)
Huh?

24:50.316 --> 24:52.851
It's pretty cool.

24:54.654 --> 24:56.455
Right?

24:56.489 --> 24:57.723
(laughs)

24:57.757 --> 24:59.324
This guy's a genius.

24:59.359 --> 25:01.126
The fractures to
the body of the sternum,

25:01.160 --> 25:03.695
the xiphoid process
and the surrounding ribs

25:03.730 --> 25:05.564
appear to be related
to chest compressions.

25:05.598 --> 25:07.265
CLARK: Which were sustained
about five months ago.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.867
Now, what's odd is that
for someone who appears

25:08.901 --> 25:10.535
to have been assaulted
at time of death,

25:10.570 --> 25:12.471
there are no Colles fractures
to the distal radius,

25:12.505 --> 25:13.772
or humeral
head breaks.

25:13.806 --> 25:15.040
Which suggests
the victim

25:15.074 --> 25:16.341
didn't try to
break his fall.

25:16.376 --> 25:17.676
Hmm.

25:17.710 --> 25:19.044
Because he lost
consciousness.

25:19.078 --> 25:20.445
But none of the
injuries he sustained

25:20.480 --> 25:22.347
would have be enough to
render him unconscious.

25:22.382 --> 25:23.548
Yeah, and
Dr. Saroyan

25:23.583 --> 25:25.283
said his tox screens
came back clear,

25:25.318 --> 25:26.885
so no drugs or alcohol.

25:26.919 --> 25:28.687
Which means there's a cause
we're not seeing.

25:28.721 --> 25:31.957
And that calls for
imagination.

25:31.991 --> 25:34.626
Well, it's what
we writers do, isn't it?

25:34.660 --> 25:37.295
But scientists require facts,
not flights of fancy.

25:37.330 --> 25:38.563
True.

25:38.598 --> 25:41.066
Of course.

25:42.902 --> 25:45.937
Congratulations on finishing
your novel, Clark.

25:45.972 --> 25:48.473
I know what
an achievement that is.

25:48.508 --> 25:49.841
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.

25:53.246 --> 25:55.013
Booth.

25:55.048 --> 25:56.782
MONTENEGRO: I reconstructed Joe Starkel's
deleted e-mails.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.918
Apparently, he wanted to be
Carrot Bill again.

25:59.952 --> 26:01.186
His brother never

26:01.220 --> 26:02.454
mentioned anything about that.

26:02.488 --> 26:03.789
Well, these weren't
to his brother.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.724
They were to the head
of the company

26:05.758 --> 26:08.126
that produced the Veg-Ta-Bills,
Henry Munson.

26:08.161 --> 26:10.462
"Munson"?
Whoa, wait a second.

26:10.496 --> 26:12.631
The new Carrot Bill
is Tommy Munson.

26:12.665 --> 26:14.166
I know.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.835
Tommy is Henry Munson's son.

26:23.961 --> 26:25.945
Look, I didn't have
any problems with Joe.

26:25.946 --> 26:27.880
He was a great guy.
No? No problems at all?

26:27.915 --> 26:30.116
Okay, Daddy didn't tell you
that Joe wanted his job back?

26:30.150 --> 26:33.152
Yeah. Sure he did. What about it?
Okay, and that didn't make you upset,

26:33.187 --> 26:35.388
that you were probably going to be replaced?
That's what I thought at first.

26:35.422 --> 26:37.023
But then Joe called me
and told me

26:37.057 --> 26:39.058
he was coming up with a whole
new character for me.

26:39.093 --> 26:40.994
Wait a second-- Joe called you,
not his brother?

26:41.028 --> 26:42.729
Yeah, he and his brother
fought all the time.

26:42.763 --> 26:44.530
They're both
artist types.

26:44.565 --> 26:45.665
He wanted to work it out
with me first.

26:45.699 --> 26:46.899
I was either
going to be

26:46.934 --> 26:49.168
an asparagus or
a Brussels sprout.

26:49.203 --> 26:51.104
But I was pushing for
the asparagus, so...

26:51.138 --> 26:52.672
so I wouldn't lose
the phallic thing.

26:52.706 --> 26:54.707
Right. Got it. Okay.
But the overall deal

26:54.742 --> 26:57.443
would be if Joe
rejoins the group,

26:57.478 --> 26:59.312
you would be getting
a pay cut.

26:59.346 --> 27:00.613
Oh, I was never
in it for the money.

27:00.648 --> 27:02.615
Why, because your daddy's rich?
No.

27:02.650 --> 27:03.883
Because of the moms.

27:03.917 --> 27:05.051
I was in it for them.

27:05.085 --> 27:07.587
The moms...?

27:07.621 --> 27:09.022
Joe cleaned up for years.

27:09.056 --> 27:11.157
A few moms would slip him
their phone numbers

27:11.191 --> 27:12.425
after every show.

27:12.459 --> 27:13.726
Then, when I got
into the carrot suit,

27:13.761 --> 27:15.128
it worked for me, too.

27:15.162 --> 27:16.462
That's why I wanted
to be an asparagus.

27:16.497 --> 27:17.764
Right. Okay.

27:17.798 --> 27:19.632
When was the last time
you saw Joe?

27:19.667 --> 27:21.034
A week ago Tuesday.

27:21.068 --> 27:22.602
I was supposed to meet up
with him after the show

27:22.636 --> 27:24.037
to talk through some concepts,
but he never showed up.

27:24.071 --> 27:25.672
Right, let
me guess...

27:25.706 --> 27:26.939
uh, no one knew

27:26.974 --> 27:28.441
that you were going to meet Joe.

27:28.475 --> 27:30.610
Well, yeah, of course.

27:30.644 --> 27:31.744
Look-look,
like I said,

27:31.779 --> 27:33.913
Joe wanted this
to be just between us

27:33.947 --> 27:35.548
until we worked out
all the details.

27:35.582 --> 27:36.783
So you don't have an alibi

27:36.817 --> 27:38.451
the day that Joe disappeared.

27:39.987 --> 27:41.621
I didn't kill Joe.

27:41.655 --> 27:44.223
Okay? You...
you have to believe me.

27:44.258 --> 27:46.259
I'm just trying to get the facts
here, Mr. Carrot,

27:46.293 --> 27:49.262
and it's not looking
too good for you.

27:49.296 --> 27:50.797
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT:
We're ready!

27:50.831 --> 27:53.099
We need the carrot!

28:01.675 --> 28:03.109
Hey.

28:03.143 --> 28:04.310
I found traces of

28:04.345 --> 28:05.978
castoreum, ambergris,

28:06.013 --> 28:08.014
musk... which
is perfume.

28:08.048 --> 28:10.550
I also found tartrazine
and glycol distearate,

28:10.584 --> 28:12.719
which is found in lipstick.
Oh.

28:12.753 --> 28:14.020
Well, that
makes sense.

28:14.054 --> 28:16.222
Apparently, he slept
with a lot of women.

28:16.256 --> 28:18.458
Listen, honey, um...

28:18.492 --> 28:19.659
we have a problem.

28:19.693 --> 28:21.928
What?

28:21.962 --> 28:23.162
Clark's book.

28:23.197 --> 28:24.897
We have to be honest with him.

28:24.932 --> 28:26.999
I mean, nobody is ever
gonna publish it.

28:27.034 --> 28:28.534
Well, it's not up to us, Angie.

28:28.569 --> 28:29.836
We don't have
a choice.

28:29.870 --> 28:31.104
He asked to see us

28:31.138 --> 28:32.638
so that we could
talk about the book.

28:32.673 --> 28:34.040
Oh, no.
Yeah.

28:34.074 --> 28:35.308
After we finish
the case.

28:35.342 --> 28:36.776
I don't suppose
it's ethical

28:36.810 --> 28:38.611
to take a lot more time
to catch a killer.

28:38.645 --> 28:40.480
We're his friends.

28:40.514 --> 28:42.615
I... I just think we should
be straight with him.

28:42.649 --> 28:43.916
Man...

28:43.951 --> 28:46.552
I hate it when you
act like an adult.

28:51.024 --> 28:52.725
What'd you find?

28:52.760 --> 28:54.827
Dr. Brennan told me
to take another look

28:54.862 --> 28:56.896
at the fractures on
the body of the sternum.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.331
Another fight?

28:58.365 --> 29:00.900
No, these are three months
before the fight.

29:00.934 --> 29:03.403
I've heard of people hating
their vegetables before,

29:03.437 --> 29:05.438
but this was one
despised carrot.

29:05.472 --> 29:06.872
These injuries
weren't from a fight.

29:06.874 --> 29:10.042
The fracturing to
the ribs and sternum,

29:10.077 --> 29:11.778
these fractures run laterally,

29:11.812 --> 29:14.580
caused by repeated forceful
compression of the rib cage.

29:14.615 --> 29:16.315
CPR?
Almost certainly.

29:16.350 --> 29:17.683
So he might
have had

29:17.718 --> 29:19.018
a heart attack
five months ago.

29:19.052 --> 29:20.253
And if he still had
a heart condition,

29:20.287 --> 29:21.687
it would explain him dropping

29:21.722 --> 29:23.289
without breaking his fall.

29:23.323 --> 29:25.158
But it wouldn't explain
why someone would dump him

29:25.192 --> 29:26.793
into a pile of kudzu.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.436
Starkel was admitted to
Mountview General two years ago,

29:36.470 --> 29:38.738
with a rare heart condition
called Long QT Syndrome.

29:38.772 --> 29:40.873
Sounds like a dude ranch.
It's a condition

29:40.908 --> 29:42.708
which increases the risk

29:42.743 --> 29:44.510
of episodes of
torsades de pointes.

29:44.545 --> 29:45.745
Wow. What's that?

29:45.779 --> 29:46.946
It's potentially
fatal arrhythmia

29:46.980 --> 29:49.749
provoked by
various stimuli.

29:49.783 --> 29:51.017
Like what?

29:51.051 --> 29:52.251
Anything that could
startle you--

29:52.286 --> 29:54.921
a loud noise or
a sudden shock.

29:54.955 --> 29:56.595
That's a hell of a way
to go through life.

29:56.623 --> 29:58.524
I'm surprised he lasted
as long as he did.

29:58.559 --> 29:59.759
Well, beta blockers
are used

29:59.793 --> 30:00.893
to treat the condition
quite effectively.

30:00.928 --> 30:02.195
All right, then
what killed him?

30:02.229 --> 30:04.430
He wasn't taking
his medication.

30:04.465 --> 30:07.433
Cam's tox screen came back
negative for all drugs,

30:07.468 --> 30:09.368
even the beta blockers.
Why would a guy with

30:09.403 --> 30:11.304
a deadly condition
not take his medication?

30:11.338 --> 30:12.772
Men have
been known

30:12.806 --> 30:14.040
to stop taking
beta blockers

30:14.074 --> 30:16.409
because of a strong...
side effect.

30:16.443 --> 30:19.111
Oh.
Impotence.

30:19.146 --> 30:21.447
Munson said that Starkel

30:21.482 --> 30:22.882
was sleeping around.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.017
So obviously,
I guess he decided that sex

30:25.052 --> 30:27.053
was more important
than staying alive.

30:27.087 --> 30:28.488
Someone could have known
his condition and figured

30:28.522 --> 30:29.822
it was a perfect way
to kill him.

30:29.857 --> 30:32.458
Oh, wow, that is just cold.

30:34.127 --> 30:36.162
Oh, oh, oh, I...
oh, I almost forgot.

30:36.196 --> 30:37.463
I almost forgot.

30:37.498 --> 30:40.132
I set up the whole,
uh, one man band

30:40.167 --> 30:42.802
ready to go for
Christine's birthday party.

30:42.836 --> 30:44.103
He's going to kill it!

30:44.137 --> 30:46.105
(imitates drums, horn)

30:46.139 --> 30:47.340
I was thinking,
Booth...

30:47.374 --> 30:49.275
Since we'll be in the park,

30:49.309 --> 30:52.144
I thought we could play tag.

30:53.146 --> 30:54.714
Sure.

30:54.748 --> 30:55.915
Tag is fun.

30:55.949 --> 30:58.851
See, you know
how to have fun.

30:58.886 --> 31:01.254
You're not gonna catch me, though.
Oh, I wouldn't

31:01.288 --> 31:03.623
be so sure.
I am quite good at tag.

31:03.657 --> 31:04.857
Come on.

31:04.892 --> 31:06.125
I used to be
a Ranger, okay?

31:06.159 --> 31:07.560
You're never
gonna catch me.

31:07.594 --> 31:10.162
We'll see.

31:11.231 --> 31:13.266
HODGINS:
<i>Hey. So I found</i>

31:13.300 --> 31:15.101
duck poo, pig bristle
and goat hairs

31:15.135 --> 31:16.335
in the kudzu run-off.

31:16.370 --> 31:18.170
Why do you get to
have all the fun?

31:18.205 --> 31:19.405
The animal particles,

31:19.439 --> 31:20.907
as well as
everything else we found,

31:20.941 --> 31:22.074
suggest that Starkel
could have been killed

31:22.109 --> 31:23.676
in a parking lot near a farm.

31:23.710 --> 31:26.012
But there are no farms close
to where the body was dumped.

31:26.046 --> 31:27.880
What are you up to?

31:27.915 --> 31:29.916
Well, I decided to search

31:29.950 --> 31:32.184
Starkel's credit card charges,
to see if it's possible

31:32.219 --> 31:34.921
to track his movements
on the day he died.

31:34.955 --> 31:36.989
Nailed it, I'm sure.
Well, no.

31:37.024 --> 31:38.457
He didn't charge
anything that day.

31:38.492 --> 31:40.426
But it did give me an idea.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.995
I expanded the search
to include all of Starkel's

31:43.030 --> 31:45.110
credit card activity
over the past two months, right?

31:45.132 --> 31:47.133
Then I cross-referenced
those charges

31:47.167 --> 31:49.302
against the credit card activity
of all of our suspects.

31:49.336 --> 31:51.604
I have married Big Brother.

31:51.638 --> 31:52.772
Interesting result.

31:52.806 --> 31:54.507
Credit card
and debit card purchases

31:54.541 --> 31:55.908
of the victim

31:55.943 --> 31:57.677
and of Marilyn Starkel

31:57.711 --> 31:59.111
intersect several times.

31:59.146 --> 32:00.513
Look.

32:00.547 --> 32:02.381
Joe Starkel rents a room
at the Tidefront Motel.

32:02.416 --> 32:03.916
And here

32:03.951 --> 32:07.219
Marilyn buys gas the following
morning, next-door.

32:07.254 --> 32:09.155
Okay.
Here's another one.

32:09.189 --> 32:11.857
A hotel stay on Joe's card.

32:11.892 --> 32:14.694
And then a trip to the closest
drug store by Marilyn

32:14.728 --> 32:16.829
that same night.

32:16.863 --> 32:19.332
Now, these two don't live
anywhere near each other.

32:19.366 --> 32:21.434
So, Carrot Bill is having an
affair with his brother's wife.

32:21.468 --> 32:24.337
And his brother would definitely
know about his heart condition.

32:28.813 --> 32:31.697
We talked to your wife, okay?
She claims that you knew, okay?

32:31.698 --> 32:34.066
That she was having an
affair with your brother.

32:35.435 --> 32:38.203
Marilyn and I are
both artists, Agent Booth.

32:38.238 --> 32:41.707
We believe in letting
our creative side out to play.

32:41.741 --> 32:43.142
"Letting your creative
side out to play."

32:43.176 --> 32:44.910
What does that have
to do with anything?

32:44.945 --> 32:46.579
She was following
her feelings,

32:46.613 --> 32:47.613
which I support.

32:47.647 --> 32:49.415
We have an open relationship.

32:49.449 --> 32:50.849
You have an open relationship?

32:50.884 --> 32:52.284
Really?
That's really convenient

32:52.319 --> 32:54.019
for you to say right now.

32:54.054 --> 32:55.854
The fact is that you knew
that your brother had

32:55.889 --> 32:58.050
a medical condition, so you
thought you could scare him

32:58.058 --> 33:00.025
so you can get away with murder.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.194
I couldn't do that
even if I wanted to.

33:02.228 --> 33:04.263
Joe was on medication.
He had it under control.

33:04.297 --> 33:05.497
You're saying you didn't
know that your brother

33:05.532 --> 33:06.812
stopped taking the
beta blockers?

33:06.833 --> 33:08.467
That's-that's crazy.

33:08.501 --> 33:09.702
Why would he do that?

33:09.736 --> 33:11.537
So he could sleep
with your wife.

33:11.571 --> 33:14.039
Look... look, I loved Joe.

33:14.074 --> 33:15.240
He was my brother.

33:15.275 --> 33:16.842
I would never kill him.

33:16.876 --> 33:19.511
Brothers kill brothers
all the time, Ken.

33:22.349 --> 33:24.249
Booth wants anything
that could possibly link

33:24.284 --> 33:26.752
Joe's brother to the murder.

33:26.786 --> 33:28.520
Well, Hodgins might be
leading us there.

33:28.555 --> 33:30.189
With ducks and pigs?

33:30.223 --> 33:31.523
Well, particulates
from an Ancona duck,

33:31.558 --> 33:32.725
Nigerian dwarf goat

33:32.759 --> 33:34.960
or a pot-bellied pig,
to be exact.

33:34.995 --> 33:37.129
MONTENEGRO:
But there are 322

33:37.163 --> 33:39.098
farms and petting zoos
and veterinary clinics

33:39.132 --> 33:41.333
in the area, which might
have those breeds.

33:41.368 --> 33:43.936
Well, Booth is not going
to 322 farms.

33:43.970 --> 33:46.438
Which is why I found a way
to narrow it down even further.

33:46.473 --> 33:48.040
Check this out.

33:48.074 --> 33:50.109
<i>Charlie's Barnyard.</i>

33:50.143 --> 33:52.177
The children's television show?

33:52.212 --> 33:54.847
Now, look at
the location.

33:54.881 --> 33:57.716
HODGINS: See, the animals
are kept in pens

33:57.751 --> 33:59.885
next to the parking lot
at the same studios

33:59.919 --> 34:01.920
the Veg-Ta-Bills use.

34:01.955 --> 34:03.656
Where his brother works.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.735
There's oil spots all
over in all these places.

34:16.770 --> 34:17.803
I hope your little
magic stick can

34:17.837 --> 34:19.004
find out where he was killed.

34:19.039 --> 34:20.272
It's not a magic stick, Booth.

34:20.306 --> 34:22.940
It's an alternative
light source.

34:22.976 --> 34:24.076
Okay, well, we need
a little magic right now.

34:24.110 --> 34:25.411
Found something.

34:28.014 --> 34:30.014
Okay, what do we got?

34:30.050 --> 34:32.985
This is definitely blood.

34:33.018 --> 34:34.453
Well, the angle matches

34:34.487 --> 34:37.188
the fracture
on the victim's parietal.

34:37.223 --> 34:39.391
This where he fell
and conked his head.

34:39.426 --> 34:40.759
Yeah, and there's
more blood here.

34:40.793 --> 34:42.527
BOOTH:
Oh! We got a trail.

34:42.562 --> 34:46.130
BRENNAN:
And it keeps going.

34:46.166 --> 34:47.498
And it stops here.

34:47.534 --> 34:48.801
Look at that.

34:48.835 --> 34:50.135
Right up to the skid marks.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.603
So, he was hit there;

34:52.639 --> 34:54.639
his body was dragged here,

34:54.674 --> 34:55.541
up to these skid marks,

34:55.574 --> 34:56.641
which are...
(chuckles)

34:56.676 --> 34:58.310
tires marks of a smaller car.

34:58.344 --> 35:00.446
Well, we can match
these tires to the ones found

35:00.480 --> 35:02.648
(phone ringing)
at the scene of the body dump.

35:02.682 --> 35:04.149
Dr. Saroyan.

35:04.184 --> 35:05.424
I don't think it's the brother.

35:05.452 --> 35:07.953
I found a compound
of propylene glycol,

35:07.987 --> 35:10.389
glyceryl stearate
and hydrolyzed lupine protein

35:10.423 --> 35:12.257
from the kudzu runoff.

35:12.292 --> 35:13.792
Those are cosmetic ingredients.

35:13.827 --> 35:14.860
You already found those.

35:14.894 --> 35:15.928
No, these are different.

35:15.962 --> 35:16.842
And the concentrations

35:16.863 --> 35:18.397
are extremely high.

35:18.431 --> 35:21.133
There's no way that Starkel
got that much on him

35:21.167 --> 35:22.968
from being with one woman.

35:23.002 --> 35:25.304
HODGINS:
I ran the compound

35:25.338 --> 35:26.705
through an FDA database.

35:26.740 --> 35:28.373
Turns out that it's unique

35:28.408 --> 35:32.311
to a moisturizer made
by a Suzy James Cosmetics.

35:32.345 --> 35:33.378
Wait a second,
that's the company

35:33.413 --> 35:35.781
that Debra Ann Volker works for.

35:41.421 --> 35:42.855
I already told you.

35:42.889 --> 35:44.923
I respected Mr. Starkel.

35:44.958 --> 35:46.925
I was grateful to him.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.961
I'd never hurt him.

35:48.995 --> 35:50.329
You didn't mean to.

35:50.363 --> 35:51.930
He had a heart condition

35:51.965 --> 35:53.031
you couldn't
have known about.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.466
But he was so healthy.

35:54.501 --> 35:56.168
No, he wasn't.
And the trunk of your car

35:56.202 --> 35:58.337
has Starkel's DNA and blood.

35:58.371 --> 36:01.774
BRENNAN: As well as cosmetics
that were found on his clothing.

36:01.808 --> 36:03.342
Plus your tires match
the tires

36:03.376 --> 36:04.376
that were found at the site

36:04.410 --> 36:06.411
where the body was dumped.

36:12.018 --> 36:15.053
(voice breaking):
He slept with so many women.

36:16.256 --> 36:17.823
Why not me?

36:17.857 --> 36:18.891
And you just, what,

36:18.925 --> 36:20.125
you wanted to
get close to him?

36:20.126 --> 36:22.261
I-I drove up behind him.

36:22.295 --> 36:25.063
And I have an electric car,

36:25.098 --> 36:27.933
so I guess he didn't,
he didn't hear me.

36:27.967 --> 36:31.370
And I got right up
to him, you know?

36:31.404 --> 36:34.072
I just wanted to surprise him.

36:34.107 --> 36:36.141
So I honked my horn.

36:36.176 --> 36:38.744
You startled him.
But he just dropped.

36:38.778 --> 36:42.648
And-and-and he hit his head
on-on the parking block.

36:42.682 --> 36:44.550
So I got out and
I-I ran to him

36:44.584 --> 36:45.617
and I tried to help him.

36:45.652 --> 36:48.554
But... he was just...

36:48.588 --> 36:50.489
I...

36:50.523 --> 36:52.257
I just wanted

36:52.292 --> 36:54.393
to get his attention, okay?

36:54.427 --> 36:56.728
I-I just wanted him
to see how good I look.

36:56.763 --> 36:59.064
'Cause that was all
because of him.

36:59.098 --> 37:01.400
He died the instant
you honked your horn.

37:01.434 --> 37:03.335
So you put him in your car
and you dumped his body.

37:03.369 --> 37:06.171
You dumped his body.

37:06.206 --> 37:08.907
I didn't know what else to do.

37:08.942 --> 37:13.445
I didn't want anybody
to think it was my fault.

37:13.479 --> 37:16.348
But it was, Debra.

Ah, since the case

38:04.330 --> 38:06.098
is over, Dr. Saroyan,
I thought it be okay

38:06.132 --> 38:08.367
for us to share a little wine.

38:08.401 --> 38:09.835
Certainly make
our conversation a lot easier.

38:09.869 --> 38:11.036
I agree.

38:11.070 --> 38:12.271
Okay, if we run out,

38:12.305 --> 38:13.739
I have more in my office.

38:13.773 --> 38:14.706
Really?

38:14.741 --> 38:16.675
Yeah. Doing what we do,

38:16.709 --> 38:18.410
I'm surprised
we all don't.

38:18.444 --> 38:20.345
Please, sit.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.080
O-Okay.

38:22.115 --> 38:23.215
(clears throat)

38:24.584 --> 38:26.985
(sighs)

38:27.020 --> 38:30.422
(exhales)
So, you-you want to...

38:30.456 --> 38:31.823
uh, to talk,

38:31.858 --> 38:34.359
um, about your book.
Yes.

38:34.394 --> 38:36.495
I can't tell you
how much it's meant to me

38:36.529 --> 38:39.898
that you guys all read my book.

38:39.933 --> 38:42.968
As your friends, we-we want
to be honest with you.

38:43.002 --> 38:44.369
Of course.

38:44.404 --> 38:46.705
But, uh, first,
I would like if we could all

38:46.739 --> 38:48.774
raise our paper cups.

38:51.477 --> 38:54.246
I can't imagine a more
wonderful group of friends

38:54.280 --> 38:56.748
to share this good news with.

38:58.551 --> 39:00.619
I'm being published.

39:00.653 --> 39:01.887
What?

39:01.921 --> 39:04.723
The same publishers
who published Dr. Brennan.

39:04.757 --> 39:06.291
They think my book
is perfect for them.

39:06.326 --> 39:08.827
They're promising
a big release.

39:08.861 --> 39:10.195
We-we... we should drink!

39:10.229 --> 39:12.631
To-to <i>Murder Made Me Do It.</i>

39:12.665 --> 39:15.233
Down the old hatch.

39:16.903 --> 39:18.737
Now, look, I-I know
that I'm published now,

39:18.771 --> 39:20.491
but I would really still like
your feedback.

39:20.506 --> 39:23.742
So, uh...
MONTENEGRO: Well, I...

39:23.776 --> 39:25.377
for one, I-I loved it.

39:25.411 --> 39:27.045
SAROYAN:
Me, too.

39:27.080 --> 39:31.283
This is... the best book
I've read in a long time.

39:33.386 --> 39:35.420
It was riveting.

39:38.725 --> 39:40.325
I gotta tell you,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.894
I can't believe
you all loved it.

39:42.929 --> 39:44.129
I know.

39:44.163 --> 39:45.864
Neither can I.

39:51.904 --> 39:53.872
Published.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.074
Yeah.

39:56.109 --> 39:58.276
BRENNAN (laughing):
Oh, no.

39:59.445 --> 40:02.547
Hello.
Hey. Where's Booth?

40:02.582 --> 40:05.484
Oh, he's dealing with Ronnie
the one-man band.

40:05.518 --> 40:08.353
(drumming, clanging)

40:08.388 --> 40:09.721
Bones.

40:09.756 --> 40:10.989
Bones!
Bones, Bones, Bones!

40:11.024 --> 40:13.592
Come here, come here.
(squeaking)

40:13.626 --> 40:15.260
Why are you wearing that?

40:15.294 --> 40:17.229
What do you mean?
Well, Ronnie, Ronnie. Look at him.

40:17.263 --> 40:18.764
He's passed out,
and I don't want him drooling

40:18.798 --> 40:20.232
all over the kids.

40:20.266 --> 40:21.700
Well, you can't
play that.

40:21.734 --> 40:23.235
What-what do you mean I can't?

40:23.269 --> 40:24.569
What? You just do this.
(cymbal clangs)

40:24.604 --> 40:26.304
One of these.
(plays accordion, squeaks)

40:26.339 --> 40:28.807
And Pops, you know, he taught me
how to play the harmonica.

40:28.841 --> 40:30.175
Listen.
(plays harmonica)

40:30.209 --> 40:31.610
(chuckles) Right?
(plays accordion)

40:31.644 --> 40:33.178
Right. So come on.
Help me in the back.

40:33.212 --> 40:34.780
Make sure everything's
all hooked up.

40:34.814 --> 40:37.082
(plays accordion)

40:37.116 --> 40:39.017
Christine is happy just playing
with her friends, Booth.

40:39.052 --> 40:41.319
Look, all right, I don't want
to disappoint Christine.

40:41.354 --> 40:44.256
I promised my little girl that I
would get her the one-man band.

40:44.290 --> 40:46.491
(plays accordion) And that's what
she's gonna get.

40:46.526 --> 40:48.093
(plays harmonica)
Okay.

40:48.127 --> 40:51.830
(Booth playing lively song)
What's happening?

41:18.524 --> 41:20.325
I want to play tag.
BOOTH: No, no.

41:20.359 --> 41:22.094
Let-let me just finish here,
honey, okay?

41:22.128 --> 41:23.728
No, Mommy said tag.

41:23.763 --> 41:25.230
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm kind of

41:25.264 --> 41:26.898
at a disadvantage here. Okay.

41:26.933 --> 41:28.300
And Mommy always won.
Want to go?

41:28.334 --> 41:29.935
I told her
it was my favorite game.

41:29.969 --> 41:32.938
Tag, you're it! Tag, tag, tag!
(drum thumping)

41:32.972 --> 41:35.674
Tempe always won.
Go get 'em! Go get 'em!

41:35.708 --> 41:38.443
(cheering, whooping)

41:38.478 --> 41:39.377
(horn honking)

41:39.412 --> 41:40.479
(laughing)

41:40.513 --> 41:44.049
Oh, no! Don't get me!

41:44.083 --> 41:46.585
Oh, did he get you?

41:46.619 --> 41:48.954
(laughing, yelling happily)

41:48.988 --> 41:51.756
Oh, you got me! I'm It!
(laughs)

41:51.791 --> 41:54.459
Oh, I'm at a serious
disadvantage here, Bones.

41:54.494 --> 41:56.337
Well, that's because
you're playing me.

41:56.362 --> 41:57.095
Ah!

41:57.096 --> 41:59.331
Ha-ha! You're It!

41:59.365 --> 42:01.066
Fade to the left!

42:01.100 --> 42:02.134
Go!

42:02.168 --> 42:04.035
