00:04.120 --> 00:07.960
<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.480
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.530
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.160 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:56.420 --> 02:00.170
<b>The Hunter Exam will now begin!</b>

02:00.170 --> 02:04.130
<b>I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.</b>

02:04.470 --> 02:08.290
<b>You must follow me to Phase Two.</b>

02:08.290 --> 02:12.560
<b>This is the exam's First Phase.</b>

02:12.560 --> 02:17.570
<b>Hope x And x Ambition</b>

02:21.070 --> 02:23.310
<b>Two hours have passed since 
the start of the exam.</b>

02:23.310 --> 02:25.330
<b>The applicants have traveled</b>

02:25.330 --> 02:28.000
<b>over thirty kilometers from the start.</b>

02:28.750 --> 02:31.420
<b>None of them knows how far they must go.</b>

02:31.420 --> 02:35.000
<b>They are forced to run at the leader's pace, 
with no goal specified.</b>

02:35.850 --> 02:38.270
<b>It's a monotonous course with no end in sight.</b>

02:38.820 --> 02:42.440
<b>And many applicants have 
already dropped out.</b>

02:50.900 --> 02:53.750
<b><i>Extrapolating from historical data, 
this exam type usually</i></b>

02:53.750 --> 02:56.150
<b><i>involves a forty-kilometer course.</i></b>

02:56.550 --> 02:57.980
<b><i>My calculations suggest that</i></b>

02:57.980 --> 03:01.160
<b><i>we are nearing the goal...</i></b>

03:10.470 --> 03:13.190
<b><i>I underestimated the Hunter Exam.</i></b>

03:13.190 --> 03:15.460
<b><i>Every person here is a monster.</i></b>

03:15.460 --> 03:17.650
<b><i>It's a gathering of monsters...</i></b>

03:20.170 --> 03:21.890
<b>Hey! Wait up, kid!</b>

03:21.890 --> 03:22.590
<b>Hmm?</b>

03:22.590 --> 03:25.000
<b>You should show the 
Hunter Exam some respect!</b>

03:25.000 --> 03:26.070
<b>What do you mean?</b>

03:26.070 --> 03:27.890
<b>Why are you using a skateboard?</b>

03:27.890 --> 03:29.430
<b>That's cheating!</b>

03:29.940 --> 03:30.710
<b>Why?</b>

03:30.710 --> 03:31.650
<b>Why...</b>

03:31.650 --> 03:33.800
<b>This is an endurance test!</b>

03:33.800 --> 03:34.810
<b>No, it isn't.</b>

03:34.810 --> 03:35.940
<b>Huh?</b>

03:37.270 --> 03:39.190
<b>Gon, what are you saying?</b>

03:39.600 --> 03:42.450
<b>The examiner only told us to follow him.</b>

03:42.450 --> 03:45.040
<b>Whose side are you on, eh?</b>

03:46.880 --> 03:48.740
<b>Hey, how old are you?</b>

03:48.740 --> 03:49.830
<b>I'm twelve years old.</b>

03:49.830 --> 03:51.300
<b>Hmm...</b>

03:51.300 --> 03:52.830
<b><i>We're the same age.</i></b>

03:52.830 --> 03:53.830
<b>Huh?</b>

03:57.070 --> 03:58.770
<b>Guess I'll run too.</b>

03:58.770 --> 04:00.020
<b>Wow!</b>

04:00.020 --> 04:01.550
<b>That was cool!</b>

04:01.930 --> 04:03.050
<b>I'm Killua.</b>

04:03.050 --> 04:04.550
<b>I'm Gon.</b>

04:05.940 --> 04:07.950
<b><i>Damn it...</i></b>

04:07.950 --> 04:10.430
<b><i>Making a fool out of me...</i></b>

04:16.710 --> 04:17.770
<b><i>Impossible.</i></b>

04:17.770 --> 04:19.860
<b><i>It's impossible!</i></b>

04:19.860 --> 04:22.080
<b><i>My calculations are never wrong!</i></b>

04:22.660 --> 04:24.150
<b><i>So why...</i></b>

04:25.130 --> 04:28.340
<b><i>Am I... going to fail?</i></b>

04:28.830 --> 04:31.060
<b><i>For me to fail...</i></b>

04:31.060 --> 04:32.020
<b><i>That's absurd.</i></b>

04:32.020 --> 04:33.080
<b><i>Unthinkable!</i></b>

04:33.080 --> 04:35.580
<b>I won't accept that!</b>

04:49.100 --> 04:50.300
<b>Hey, rookie!</b>

04:52.580 --> 04:54.620
<b>You're a mess.</b>

04:54.620 --> 04:57.860
<b>It's rare to see someone 
out of steam so early.</b>

04:57.860 --> 05:01.480
<b>You must be a hell of an incompetent.</b>

05:01.480 --> 05:05.530
<b>People like you are doomed 
to fail the Hunter Exam.</b>

05:05.530 --> 05:07.840
<b>So don't come back, snotrag!</b>

05:14.870 --> 05:17.310
<b>Here. Thanks.</b>

05:17.730 --> 05:18.830
<b>Great work.</b>

05:19.460 --> 05:22.830
<b>He won't recover from the abuse 
we just dished out.</b>

05:23.330 --> 05:26.560
<b>I doubt he'll ever take the 
Hunter Exam again.</b>

05:26.560 --> 05:28.470
<b>Anyway, Tonpa...</b>

05:28.470 --> 05:31.540
<b>You really do love crushing rookies.</b>

05:33.190 --> 05:35.590
<b>I live for it.</b>

05:50.070 --> 05:53.030
<b><i>It's been about four hours since the exam began.</i></b>

05:53.030 --> 05:55.950
<b><i>We must have traveled at least sixty kilometers.</i></b>

05:56.560 --> 05:59.130
<b><i>How much farther do we need to go?</i></b>

06:08.610 --> 06:13.760
<b><i>Only one rookie, every three years, 
passes the Hunter Exam.</i></b>

06:15.410 --> 06:17.740
<b><i>So for a normal human like me,</i></b>

06:17.740 --> 06:20.900
<b><i>it isn't even worth dreaming about...</i></b>

06:21.880 --> 06:23.730
<b><i>Damn it.</i></b>

06:49.270 --> 06:50.880
<b>Hey, forget him.</b>

06:50.880 --> 06:51.890
<b>Let's get going.</b>

07:12.050 --> 07:13.870
<b>Screw that...</b>

07:14.910 --> 07:18.870
<b>I'm gonna become a Hunter!</b>

07:19.500 --> 07:23.210
<b>Damn it all!</b>

07:34.900 --> 07:36.310
<b>Cool!</b>

07:37.360 --> 07:39.190
<b>Let me try that later.</b>

07:39.190 --> 07:41.300
<b>If you let me try your skateboard, okay?</b>

07:51.990 --> 07:54.450
<b><i>We've reached the eighty-kilometer mark.</i></b>

07:54.850 --> 07:58.200
<b><i>It is now time to pick up the pace a bit.</i></b>

08:03.210 --> 08:04.940
<b>Wait, are you serious?</b>

08:04.940 --> 08:06.290
<b>That guy's insane.</b>

08:06.290 --> 08:10.460
<b>He's prancing up the stairs, 
as if they're not even there.</b>

08:10.460 --> 08:12.080
<b>If he keeps up this pace,</b>

08:12.080 --> 08:14.200
<b>tons of people will fail.</b>

08:14.970 --> 08:18.970
<b>Gon, wanna race to see who finishes first?</b>

08:18.970 --> 08:20.040
<b>Sure.</b>

08:20.040 --> 08:22.130
<b>The loser has to buy dinner.</b>

08:22.130 --> 08:23.600
<b>Okay, you're on!</b>

08:23.980 --> 08:25.120
<b>Ready...</b>

08:25.120 --> 08:25.980
<b>Go!</b>

08:32.190 --> 08:34.150
<b>Leorio, are you okay?</b>

08:34.150 --> 08:35.070
<b>Sure!</b>

08:35.070 --> 08:36.600
<b>Just look at me.</b>

08:37.070 --> 08:39.410
<b>I realized that I can keep going</b>

08:39.410 --> 08:41.500
<b>if I don't worry about how stupid I look!</b>

08:44.450 --> 08:47.000
<b><i>I should probably follow his example.</i></b>

08:52.380 --> 08:53.380
<b>Leorio...</b>

08:53.380 --> 08:54.720
<b>I have a question.</b>

08:55.100 --> 08:56.180
<b>What?</b>

08:56.180 --> 08:58.120
<b>Is this too easy for you, Kurapika?</b>

08:58.820 --> 09:01.720
<b>Talking just wastes energy!</b>

09:02.140 --> 09:05.730
<b>Are you really trying to become 
a Hunter for the money?</b>

09:07.060 --> 09:08.400
<b>You aren't, right?</b>

09:08.400 --> 09:10.390
<b>We've only been together for a few days,</b>

09:10.390 --> 09:12.140
<b>but I know you better than that.</b>

09:13.690 --> 09:17.490
<b>Sure, you have a nasty attitude, 
and you aren't very bright.</b>

09:18.990 --> 09:22.240
<b>But you're not a shallow person.</b>

09:22.800 --> 09:26.360
<b>I've seen many who live for money.</b>

09:26.360 --> 09:28.330
<b>You're nothing like them.</b>

09:29.430 --> 09:31.250
<b>You and your logic...</b>

09:37.300 --> 09:38.010
<b>Scarlet eyes.</b>

09:39.220 --> 09:42.260
<b>That's why the Kurta were targeted.</b>

09:45.730 --> 09:50.150
<b>We Kurta are known for 
our unique scarlet eyes.</b>

09:50.150 --> 09:52.630
<b>When our emotions are heightened,</b>

09:52.630 --> 09:55.980
<b>our eyes turn scarlet, as though on fire.</b>

09:57.910 --> 10:00.120
<b>The eyes in that scarlet state</b>

10:00.120 --> 10:03.530
<b>are considered one of the seven most 
beautiful colors in the world.</b>

10:03.530 --> 10:06.520
<b>They command high prices 
on the black market.</b>

10:07.700 --> 10:11.300
<b>That's why the Phantom Troupe 
attacked you?</b>

10:13.020 --> 10:18.250
<b>They took every single eye from 
my brethren's corpses.</b>

10:19.420 --> 10:24.140
<b>I can still hear their darkened eyes 
crying out in anguish...</b>

10:26.610 --> 10:29.880
<b>I swear I will capture the Phantom Troupe!</b>

10:30.430 --> 10:34.570
<b>And I will reclaim the eyes of my clan!</b>

10:35.230 --> 10:37.280
<b>That's why you want to be a Hunter?</b>

10:37.280 --> 10:40.880
<b>Yeah, if I become a Hunter with rich clients,</b>

10:40.880 --> 10:44.540
<b>I'll gain access to black market information.</b>

10:44.540 --> 10:47.380
<b>But you'll have to swallow your pride</b>

10:47.380 --> 10:50.460
<b>and become the kind of Hunter you despise!</b>

10:50.840 --> 10:53.060
<b>The blow to my pride is nothing,</b>

10:53.060 --> 10:55.960
<b>measured against the suffering 
my clan endured.</b>

11:02.210 --> 11:05.930
<b>Sorry, but I have no noble cause.</b>

11:06.350 --> 11:07.210
<b>Huh?</b>

11:07.210 --> 11:09.760
<b>I'm just after money.</b>

11:09.760 --> 11:11.230
<b>Don't lie!</b>

11:11.230 --> 11:12.490
<b>I'm not lying!</b>

11:12.490 --> 11:17.360
<b>You really believe you can buy 
everything with money?</b>

11:17.360 --> 11:18.760
<b>You bet!</b>

11:18.760 --> 11:21.950
<b>For the right price, you can buy not only 
treasures, but dreams, hearts,</b>

11:21.950 --> 11:23.530
<b>and even people's lives!</b>

11:24.530 --> 11:26.520
<b>Take that back, Leorio!</b>

11:26.520 --> 11:29.120
<b>If you're insulting the Kurta, 
I won't forgive you.</b>

11:29.120 --> 11:31.670
<b>Why? I'm telling the truth.</b>

11:31.670 --> 11:34.340
<b>If I'd had money, my friend 
wouldn't have died!</b>

11:42.070 --> 11:43.270
<b>An illness?</b>

11:43.760 --> 11:46.890
<b>It was a treatable disease...</b>

12:06.410 --> 12:08.910
<b>The problem was that the 
operation costs a fortune.</b>

12:09.580 --> 12:11.580
<b>I was na√Øve!</b>

12:11.580 --> 12:12.920
<b>I thought I could become a doctor...</b>

12:13.780 --> 12:16.110
<b>I wanted to cure kids who have 
the same disease,</b>

12:16.110 --> 12:18.420
<b>and be able to tell them 
it was free of charge!</b>

12:19.150 --> 12:21.250
<b>Then I could have told his parents, too.</b>

12:21.250 --> 12:22.790
<b>That was my dream...</b>

12:25.840 --> 12:27.590
<b>What a joke.</b>

12:28.270 --> 12:30.230
<b>Turns out that to become a doctor,</b>

12:30.230 --> 12:32.810
<b>you need even more money!</b>

12:33.230 --> 12:34.330
<b>Got it?</b>

12:34.330 --> 12:35.840
<b>The world runs on money...</b>

12:35.840 --> 12:38.320
<b>So I want money!</b>

12:42.320 --> 12:44.020
<b>See you at the goal, Kurapika.</b>

12:44.020 --> 12:45.730
<b>Catch you later, old timer.</b>

12:45.730 --> 12:47.140
<b>I'm not old!</b>

12:47.140 --> 12:49.580
<b>I'm a teenager, just like you guys!</b>

12:51.400 --> 12:52.120
<b>Huh?</b>

12:52.120 --> 12:53.180
<b>No way!</b>

12:55.040 --> 13:05.130
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

13:01.090 --> 13:05.130
<b>Killua</b>

13:10.390 --> 13:13.180
<b>Can't take another step...</b>

13:13.740 --> 13:15.750
<b>Th-This is it...</b>

13:21.650 --> 13:25.060
<b>I'm impressed that you 
can keep up with me.</b>

13:25.060 --> 13:25.880
<b>Really?</b>

13:28.040 --> 13:30.910
<b>Or maybe it's just that 
everyone else is too slow.</b>

13:31.780 --> 13:33.200
<b>Man...</b>

13:33.200 --> 13:35.930
<b>The Hunter Exam is gonna be a breeze.</b>

13:35.930 --> 13:37.030
<b>That's no fun.</b>

13:37.030 --> 13:39.670
<b>Hey, why do you want to 
become a Hunter?</b>

13:40.330 --> 13:41.430
<b>Me?</b>

13:41.430 --> 13:43.490
<b>I'm not really interested in 
becoming a Hunter.</b>

13:43.490 --> 13:43.920
<b>Huh?</b>

13:44.600 --> 13:47.170
<b>I heard the exam was supposed 
to be really hard,</b>

13:47.170 --> 13:49.340
<b>so I thought it'd be fun.</b>

13:49.810 --> 13:51.430
<b>But this is disappointing.</b>

13:52.960 --> 13:53.990
<b>What about you?</b>

13:53.990 --> 13:57.210
<b>Well, my dad's a Hunter.</b>

13:57.210 --> 14:00.910
<b>So I want to become a Hunter, like my dad.</b>

14:00.910 --> 14:02.060
<b>Hmm...</b>

14:02.060 --> 14:03.680
<b>What kind of Hunter is he?</b>

14:03.680 --> 14:04.890
<b>I don't know.</b>

14:06.690 --> 14:08.650
<b>That's kinda weird.</b>

14:08.650 --> 14:09.590
<b>Really?</b>

14:09.590 --> 14:11.280
<b>You want to be like your dad,</b>

14:11.280 --> 14:13.910
<b>but you don't know anything about him?</b>

14:14.410 --> 14:17.750
<b>I was raised by Mito-san,</b>

14:17.750 --> 14:20.160
<b>so I've only seen my dad in pictures.</b>

14:20.160 --> 14:22.020
<b>Who's Mito-san?</b>

14:22.020 --> 14:22.920
<b>Aunt Mito.</b>

14:23.470 --> 14:24.170
<b>Oh...</b>

14:24.490 --> 14:28.190
<b>When he was twelve, 
my dad took the Hunter Exam.</b>

14:28.890 --> 14:31.180
<b>He passed and became a Hunter.</b>

14:31.180 --> 14:32.890
<b>Then he left the island.</b>

14:33.880 --> 14:36.290
<b>I want to find out why he 
chose to be a Hunter</b>

14:36.290 --> 14:37.940
<b>over being with me.</b>

14:41.260 --> 14:42.530
<b>The exit!</b>

14:42.530 --> 14:43.810
<b>Whew...</b>

14:43.810 --> 14:46.190
<b>Finally, I can get out of this dark tunnel!</b>

14:51.610 --> 14:55.700
<b><i>Now, let's see how many made it this far.</i></b>

15:00.280 --> 15:02.920
<b>Goal!</b>

15:06.210 --> 15:08.190
<b>Yay! I win.</b>

15:08.190 --> 15:09.320
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

15:09.320 --> 15:11.020
<b>I was faster...</b>

15:11.020 --> 15:12.120
<b>I was.</b>

15:12.120 --> 15:13.240
<b>No, I was!</b>

15:13.240 --> 15:15.930
<b>I was faster, so you have to buy dinner!</b>

15:15.930 --> 15:17.000
<b>Nope!</b>

15:17.000 --> 15:18.270
<b>I was faster.</b>

15:18.270 --> 15:19.710
<b>So you buy me dinner.</b>

15:19.710 --> 15:21.900
<b>But I was faster.</b>

15:22.330 --> 15:24.590
<b>Hey, who was faster?</b>

15:24.590 --> 15:27.210
<b>I believe that you crossed the 
finish line simultaneously.</b>

15:27.660 --> 15:29.220
<b>Oh...</b>

15:29.220 --> 15:31.860
<b>Then I'll buy you dinner.</b>

15:31.860 --> 15:32.420
<b>Huh?</b>

15:32.420 --> 15:35.130
<b>Then you buy me dinner!</b>

15:35.130 --> 15:36.410
<b>I don't get it.</b>

15:37.420 --> 15:39.240
<b>Hey, Satotz-san.</b>

15:39.240 --> 15:40.790
<b>Is this where the Second Phase 
of the exam takes place?</b>

15:41.290 --> 15:44.130
<b>No, we still have quite a way to go.</b>

15:44.130 --> 15:45.790
<b>Oh...</b>

16:07.170 --> 16:08.570
<b>Hey, Kurapika!</b>

16:10.110 --> 16:11.590
<b>Is this our destination?</b>

16:11.590 --> 16:13.030
<b>No, it isn't.</b>

16:13.030 --> 16:14.060
<b>I see.</b>

16:15.000 --> 16:16.350
<b>The fog is fading.</b>

16:17.190 --> 16:18.080
<b>Really?</b>

16:37.380 --> 16:38.810
<b>The Numere Wetlands,</b>

16:38.810 --> 16:41.230
<b>also known as Swindlers Swamp.</b>

16:41.230 --> 16:45.190
<b>We must cross these wetlands to 
reach Phase Two of the exam.</b>

16:45.190 --> 16:48.150
<b>This place is home to many bizarre animals,</b>

16:48.610 --> 16:52.680
<b>many of them being cunning, insatiable creatures</b>

16:52.680 --> 16:55.360
<b>who deceive humans and prey upon them.</b>

16:56.350 --> 16:58.870
<b>Be very careful.</b>

17:01.490 --> 17:03.790
<b>If you let them fool you...</b>

17:03.790 --> 17:05.120
<b>...you're dead.</b>

17:11.530 --> 17:12.480
<b>Wait for me!</b>

17:18.240 --> 17:20.150
<b>These wetland creatures will use</b>

17:20.150 --> 17:24.540
<b>every trick in the book to fool their prey.</b>

17:25.660 --> 17:29.820
<b>An ecosystem in which creatures 
obtain food through deceit...</b>

17:31.210 --> 17:33.950
<b>Hence the name Swindlers Swamp.</b>

17:35.320 --> 17:39.990
<b>Stay very close to me so you won't be deceived.</b>

17:43.460 --> 17:45.190
<b>What a joke.</b>

17:45.190 --> 17:48.600
<b>How can they fool us, 
when we're expecting it?</b>

17:48.600 --> 17:49.750
<b>Don't let them fool you!</b>

17:50.770 --> 17:52.500
<b>I just said that they can't.</b>

17:54.360 --> 17:57.260
<b>D-Don't fall for it...</b>

17:58.830 --> 18:02.010
<b>He's lying to you!</b>

18:05.370 --> 18:07.020
<b>He's an impostor!</b>

18:07.020 --> 18:08.720
<b>He isn't an examiner...</b>

18:08.720 --> 18:10.270
<b>I'm the real examiner.</b>

18:11.270 --> 18:12.570
<b>An impostor?</b>

18:12.570 --> 18:13.530
<b>What's going on?</b>

18:13.530 --> 18:16.030
<b>Then who is he?</b>

18:17.030 --> 18:19.220
<b>Look at this...</b>

18:23.830 --> 18:25.410
<b>He looks just like Satotz-san!</b>

18:25.410 --> 18:28.920
<b>It's a Man-Faced Ape, one of the creatures 
that dwell in the Numere Wetlands!</b>

18:28.920 --> 18:30.420
<b>A Man-Faced Ape?</b>

18:31.050 --> 18:33.920
<b>Man-Faced Apes love the taste 
of fresh human flesh.</b>

18:34.580 --> 18:38.990
<b>However, their limbs are long and thin, 
so they're quite weak.</b>

18:38.990 --> 18:41.220
<b>That's why they disguise themselves as humans.</b>

18:41.220 --> 18:44.600
<b>They trick humans into following them 
into these wetlands,</b>

18:44.600 --> 18:47.510
<b>where they team up with other animals 
to kill and devour them.</b>

18:48.080 --> 18:53.020
<b>He intends to trap every single applicant!</b>

18:55.030 --> 18:56.530
<b>Bastard...</b>

18:56.760 --> 19:01.530
<b>He certainly doesn't walk like a human...</b>

19:04.830 --> 19:05.580
<b>Huh?</b>

19:20.000 --> 19:22.350
<b>I see, I see...</b>

19:22.920 --> 19:24.810
<b>That settles it...</b>

19:24.810 --> 19:26.720
<b>You're the real one.</b>

19:32.310 --> 19:35.570
<b><i>What? He's the real examiner?</i></b>

19:36.820 --> 19:37.570
<b>Huh?</b>

19:40.070 --> 19:42.430
<b>Examiners are Hunters</b>

19:42.430 --> 19:47.080
<b>selected by the committee to perform 
this duty without pay.</b>

19:47.590 --> 19:51.080
<b>Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,</b>

19:51.360 --> 19:55.340
<b>would have been able to block that attack.</b>

19:55.870 --> 19:58.380
<b>I shall take that as a compliment.</b>

19:59.270 --> 20:04.120
<b>However, should you attack me again, 
for any reason,</b>

20:04.120 --> 20:06.760
<b>I will report you for turning 
on an examiner.</b>

20:06.760 --> 20:09.360
<b>And you will be immediately disqualified.</b>

20:09.360 --> 20:10.230
<b>Are we clear?</b>

20:10.590 --> 20:11.680
<b>Sure.</b>

20:17.560 --> 20:21.170
<b>Nature really can be brutal to watch...</b>

20:21.170 --> 20:23.490
<b>So he was a Man-Faced Ape, as well.</b>

20:23.490 --> 20:27.800
<b>He was attempting to confuse 
the applicants,</b>

20:27.800 --> 20:30.000
<b>to lure some of them away.</b>

20:31.330 --> 20:33.100
<b>We cannot relax our guard.</b>

20:33.100 --> 20:33.870
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:34.290 --> 20:38.880
<b>You will be encountering such 
deception on a regular basis.</b>

20:40.770 --> 20:43.280
<b>I believe that a number of you</b>

20:43.280 --> 20:45.890
<b>were fooled into suspecting my identity?</b>

20:49.990 --> 20:51.750
<b>Do you understand?</b>

20:51.750 --> 20:57.860
<b>If you lose sight of me in 
the Numere Wetlands fog,</b>

20:57.860 --> 21:02.140
<b>you will never reach the exam's Second Phase.</b>

21:02.140 --> 21:03.150
<b>Do bear that in mind.</b>

21:04.440 --> 21:06.000
<b>Then let us be on our way.</b>

21:06.000 --> 21:07.160
<b>Please follow me.</b>

21:29.210 --> 21:31.530
<b>Tsk, another marathon.</b>

21:31.530 --> 21:33.870
<b>And we're running through marsh this time.</b>

21:33.870 --> 21:36.850
<b>Running on wet ground requires more energy.</b>

21:37.990 --> 21:42.610
<b>The applicants have finally escaped 
the long, dark tunnel.</b>

21:42.610 --> 21:46.520
<b>Thus far, 36 candidates have 
withdrawn from the exam,</b>

21:46.520 --> 21:49.380
<b>leaving 368 remaining applicants.</b>

21:49.380 --> 21:52.680
<b>Their next challenge is the Numere Wetlands,</b>

21:52.680 --> 21:55.660
<b>also known as Swindlers Swamp.</b>

21:56.200 --> 21:59.710
<b>The brutal Hunter Exam continues.</b>

23:30.050 --> 23:32.390
<b>Next time: Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!</b>

23:32.560 --> 23:34.040
<b>Okey-dokey!</b>
