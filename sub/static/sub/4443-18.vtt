00:00.326 --> 00:01.593
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.604 --> 00:03.243
- What about Lexi?
- She's in Honduras.

00:03.328 --> 00:04.461
But I don't do cheating.

00:04.496 --> 00:06.430
Maybe we shouldn't go with
an anonymous sperm donor.

00:06.544 --> 00:09.146
Maybe we should ask Timothy.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.282
If you're interested in using
me as a sperm donor, I'm in.

00:12.317 --> 00:13.550
- I kept the money.
- I owe it to my dad.

00:13.675 --> 00:15.442
I used it for something else.

00:15.476 --> 00:18.244
You're concerned about my
sobriety. I know I saw you.

00:18.263 --> 00:19.630
- It was a one time thing.
- It was for me, too.

00:19.681 --> 00:21.415
It won't ever happen again.

00:21.449 --> 00:23.350
Kids with ADHD, it actually
helps them to focus.

00:23.384 --> 00:25.586
I don't wanna take this stuff.
If I can get off of it...

00:25.620 --> 00:27.437
What about getting into a contact sport?

00:27.472 --> 00:29.606
Someone got into the
administrative office last night.

00:29.641 --> 00:32.308
And a number of Kindle
Paperwhites are now missing.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.461
- You didn't give my keys to anyone, did you?
- No.

00:34.495 --> 00:36.663
You didn't come by school
last night, did you?

00:36.698 --> 00:40.367
- No, I was at the house having dinner. Why?
- Daphne said she saw you.

00:40.401 --> 00:42.536
When you were in the office
last night, making the IDs,

00:42.570 --> 00:43.704
- did you steal some stuff, too?
- So what?

00:43.738 --> 00:45.372
Whatever you took, put it back.

00:45.406 --> 00:46.673
- What's that?
- It's Brandon's car.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.575
He was there last night.

00:59.666 --> 01:02.567
Morning.

01:04.370 --> 01:06.505
- How did you sleep?
- Ok.

01:06.539 --> 01:09.608
Did you make a list of everyone
who was there at your photo shoot?

01:09.642 --> 01:11.443
Yeah.

01:16.649 --> 01:20.385
Are you going to tell
Principal Sanchez about Daphne?

01:22.288 --> 01:23.655
I think I have to, honey.

01:25.291 --> 01:26.692
She's trying to get her daughter back.

01:26.726 --> 01:32.397
Well, we have to file a police
report for the insurance.

01:32.432 --> 01:36.401
She's almost eighteen. They
could send her to prison.

01:38.337 --> 01:40.372
There were other people there.

01:41.541 --> 01:44.276
Not people who had keys to the office.

01:47.714 --> 01:49.748
I shouldn't have told you.

01:49.782 --> 01:55.320
Honey, if Daphne didn't take anything
then she's got nothing to worry about.

01:56.556 --> 01:59.691
I know it was really hard but
you did the right thing. Ok?

02:39.732 --> 02:42.634
Jesus, breakfast! Let's go!

03:12.515 --> 03:14.266
Seriously, we're out of milk?

03:15.268 --> 03:16.434
Guess I drank it all.

03:17.469 --> 03:19.337
Surprise!

03:19.372 --> 03:21.273
You're back?

03:22.408 --> 03:24.576
- Are you surprised?!
- Are you kidding?

03:24.610 --> 03:28.613
Oh, I missed you so much.

03:28.648 --> 03:30.348
Me, too.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.738
You should've seen your face,
Jesus, totally priceless.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.474
No one tipped you off?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.644
No. I can honestly say I
was blind-sided by this one.

04:22.546 --> 04:24.347
So, how long are you here?

04:24.382 --> 04:28.351
- For a week. Isn't that great?
- Great!

04:28.386 --> 04:31.454
But no closed doors in this house.
She's staying in Mariana's room.

04:31.489 --> 04:35.525
We promised Lexi's parents, there
will be no... funny business.

04:35.559 --> 04:39.529
- I know what funny business is.
- Hey, you be careful, young man.

04:39.563 --> 04:41.233
Lexi, these pictures are really beautiful.

04:41.234 --> 04:43.416
I had no idea Honduras was so...

04:43.668 --> 04:47.370
Tropical? You live in, like, paradise.

04:47.405 --> 04:47.923
I know, right?

04:47.924 --> 04:51.384
I move over 2,000 miles away and I'm
still going to school by the beach.

04:51.475 --> 04:53.609
Oh, speaking of school,
we gotta roll you guys.

04:53.628 --> 04:55.662
- Oh, yeah.
- Like now. Let's go.

04:55.713 --> 04:56.663
You're coming with us?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.300
I thought I'd surprise some of my girls.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.652
When I'm not spending every free
second I have with you, that is.

05:04.422 --> 05:06.656
Oh, Lexi! You forgot
your phone, sweetheart.

05:06.691 --> 05:08.491
I'll take it to her.

05:08.526 --> 05:09.559
Thanks, Jesus.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.437
Hey you, plenty of time for photos later.

05:20.471 --> 05:22.372
Sorry, just wanted to see for myself.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.442
Well, maybe we'll just
take a few of our own then.

05:25.476 --> 05:27.510
Say... tonight?

05:29.547 --> 05:31.514
By the way, where's Brandon?

05:34.518 --> 05:35.685
Hot, hot. Ow!

05:35.720 --> 05:37.721
You know, I'm sure Dad has
a spatula somewhere for that.

05:37.755 --> 05:42.425
Spatulas are for wusses. I
hope you like French Toast.

05:42.460 --> 05:45.428
I do, but I'm actually
running late. So, thanks.

05:45.463 --> 05:47.497
- Brandon.
- Yeah.

05:47.515 --> 05:50.333
I don't want things to be weird between us.

05:50.368 --> 05:52.302
Yeah, no, I mean...

05:52.336 --> 05:55.505
We both made mistakes.
We're gonna fix it, right?

05:55.539 --> 05:57.340
Right.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.409
Which means you gotta
get rid of that fake ID

05:59.443 --> 06:01.411
I'm not going to tell your dad,

06:01.445 --> 06:03.646
but if you got caught using it
you can get in a lot of trouble.

06:03.681 --> 06:06.282
I'm not going to use it
again. I'm getting rid of it.

06:06.317 --> 06:07.650
Good.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.455
- Good morning, son.
- Goodbye, Father.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.459
- Good talkin' to ya.
- He's late.

06:16.494 --> 06:18.361
What do we have here?

06:18.379 --> 06:22.365
Breakfast. I don't like you and
Brandon having cereal every morning.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.585
And with you working nights, I thought I'd
at least get one good meal in him today.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.722
I know. I've been trying to
get back to days, but no luck.

06:28.756 --> 06:32.509
Well, until you do, Brandon's gonna
keep coming home to an empty house,

06:32.543 --> 06:35.311
and, uh... I worry.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.349
What? That he's not eating right?

06:39.383 --> 06:41.317
And other things.

06:41.352 --> 06:42.718
Other things? Like what?

06:42.737 --> 06:46.523
I don't know, getting in trouble?

06:47.491 --> 06:49.392
Brandon's never been in trouble.

06:49.427 --> 06:52.328
I mean, other than this Callie business...

06:52.363 --> 06:55.565
Besides, it's temporary, him being here.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.367
Are you sure?

06:57.401 --> 06:58.585
I mean, do you really think

06:58.619 --> 07:02.405
he's gonna be able to live
under the same roof as Callie?

07:02.440 --> 07:06.593
I dunno. I mean, don't get me wrong,

07:06.627 --> 07:10.346
I'd love to have him here long term,

07:10.381 --> 07:12.599
but he's so used to a full house.

07:15.519 --> 07:16.719
What if I moved in?

07:19.423 --> 07:23.626
Wouldn't be a full house, but
at least it wouldn't be empty.

07:27.398 --> 07:29.632
Don't you think it's a little soon?

07:29.667 --> 07:31.734
Come on, Mike, we're not kids.

07:31.768 --> 07:36.372
We know when it's right.
And this is right. Why wait?

07:36.407 --> 07:41.344
Why not, ya know... lean in?

07:50.304 --> 07:52.422
Hey, I need to talk to you.

07:52.456 --> 07:54.340
Are you ok?

07:55.626 --> 07:58.328
Did you... break up with Lexi?

07:58.362 --> 08:02.532
No. I tried, I did, but
I couldn't because...

08:06.337 --> 08:07.403
She's here.

08:07.438 --> 08:09.639
I had no idea she was coming back.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.640
Bye.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.609
Hey.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.496
You're Emma. We met online.

08:17.498 --> 08:21.317
Yeah, I crashed your "Jesus time."

08:21.352 --> 08:22.552
My what?

08:22.586 --> 08:24.370
She's just joking.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.689
Lexi's staying with us for a whole week!

08:26.724 --> 08:29.259
I totally surprised him. You
should have seen his face.

08:29.293 --> 08:31.544
I would have loved to.

08:31.595 --> 08:35.431
Well, since you're here, we'll
see you at the meet later.

08:35.466 --> 08:38.735
Oh, to watch me ride the bench?
You don't need to do that.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.636
I wanna be wherever you are today, silly.

08:40.671 --> 08:43.339
Yeah... silly.

08:46.677 --> 08:48.645
- Oh, my God!
- Ow!

08:48.679 --> 08:51.514
- You need to see the nurse.
- I'm fine.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.733
No, you're really not
fine. I'll see you at lunch.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.388
Should I be worried?

08:58.422 --> 09:01.541
Not at all. She's totally
in the friend-zone.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.626
Trust me, I've been all over that.

09:03.661 --> 09:06.429
If anything was going on, I'd know.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.251
Zac. This is Lexi.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.419
Best friend. Meet my best new friend.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.637
Only new friend.

09:14.672 --> 09:16.506
Hey!

09:16.540 --> 09:19.375
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.
She talks about you all the time.

09:19.410 --> 09:20.510
Yeah, you too.

09:20.544 --> 09:21.578
Really?

09:23.480 --> 09:26.249
Well, I'm glad to know
someone else on Team Mariana.

09:26.283 --> 09:28.618
Again, it's a team of one, so
we could use a few more bodies.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.441
Ok, you can not be friends with that guy.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.694
What? Why not? You don't like him?

09:37.728 --> 09:41.564
I mean, he's adorable,
but he's not your friend.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.400
He's your crush.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.403
Oh, right. He was into me for awhile but...

09:47.421 --> 09:48.738
No, you're into him.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.340
What?

09:50.374 --> 09:52.342
Girl, you like, like him.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.510
I have never thought about him that way.

09:54.545 --> 09:57.380
Ok, well, your mind better
catch up with your body

09:57.414 --> 10:00.266
because your body kinda wants
to have his babies right now.

10:00.301 --> 10:02.552
You have sex on the brain.

10:02.586 --> 10:06.556
I didn't fly across the world
to have another video chat. Ok?

10:21.805 --> 10:23.406
Did you do it?

10:23.440 --> 10:26.309
Relax. The Kindles are back, ok?

10:26.343 --> 10:28.611
And you'll have your 900
bucks this afternoon. So chill.

10:28.646 --> 10:32.515
I can't believe you stole them in
the first place. What an idiot move.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.319
You know what's an idiot move?
Making this a one time thing.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.720
All I'm sayin' is after
you pay back your dad,

10:37.755 --> 10:39.589
you could make some real bank for yourself.

10:39.623 --> 10:41.724
Money equals freedom, bro. Think about it.

10:41.759 --> 10:44.394
Yeah, well, I don't need to. I'm done.

10:46.764 --> 10:48.564
I've gotta take this.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.675
Whoa, slow your roll, tiger.

11:04.005 --> 11:05.255
Thanks.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.011
Didn't know you could read.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.865
I like the pictures. What can I do for you?

11:14.899 --> 11:16.867
I want in.

11:16.901 --> 11:17.901
On what?

11:17.936 --> 11:20.004
You know what I'm talking about.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.217
Really?

11:22.307 --> 11:25.876
I just assumed a girl like
you already had a fake.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.861
Fake ID?

11:27.896 --> 11:32.249
Hey, no judgment. It's just,
you know, you are juvie girl.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.285
Well, I don't have one.

11:36.955 --> 11:40.290
- I'll need a photo.
- Ok.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.826
Stand over here, by the wall.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.266
So, where do you make them? The IDs?

11:49.300 --> 11:53.137
Afraid that's classified information.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.972
Here at school?

11:57.942 --> 11:59.176
Say, happy-hour!

12:07.185 --> 12:08.252
What's going on?

12:08.286 --> 12:12.022
Oh, nothing bad, honey.
We... Stef came by for lunch

12:12.057 --> 12:15.259
and we thought this might be a
good time to talk to you two alone.

12:21.082 --> 12:24.935
Uh, so, it's about the adoption.

12:24.969 --> 12:30.140
But before we start I wanted to let you know
that the Kindles were returned last night.

12:30.175 --> 12:31.942
They were?

12:31.976 --> 12:37.081
Yes. So we don't need to talk to
Principal Sanchez about... anything.

12:39.317 --> 12:45.022
So, anyway, as you know we've
started the adoption process,

12:45.056 --> 12:47.291
but before we can petition the court we...

12:47.325 --> 12:51.128
we have to ask permission from your father.

12:52.163 --> 12:53.263
What does that mean?

12:53.298 --> 12:56.300
He has to sign away his parental rights.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.869
Why does he have any rights?

12:58.903 --> 13:02.239
He hasn't written us or
tried to contact us in years.

13:02.273 --> 13:06.977
Well, legally, he's still
your biological parent.

13:07.011 --> 13:08.979
- Could he say no?
- He won't.

13:09.013 --> 13:10.247
What if he does?

13:10.281 --> 13:12.783
Then, we will petition the
court to take away his rights,

13:12.817 --> 13:15.819
but hopefully that won't be necessary.

13:15.854 --> 13:17.921
We just need to know from you guys

13:17.956 --> 13:22.025
if it's all right if we ask
him to let us be your parents.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.128
It's fine.

13:25.897 --> 13:28.198
Do you have to ask him in person?

13:28.233 --> 13:31.168
- No, no, the lawyer will do that.
- In jail?

13:32.937 --> 13:37.007
He's not in jail... prison anymore.

13:41.212 --> 13:44.148
After I ran away, I tried to call him.

13:45.183 --> 13:49.853
And they said he got out a year ago.

13:49.888 --> 13:51.255
Why didn't you tell me?

13:51.289 --> 13:56.827
Because, obviously, he doesn't
care about us anymore and...

13:56.861 --> 13:58.228
And you were trying to protect me again?

14:01.232 --> 14:04.101
- Can I go eat lunch?
- Sure.

14:05.236 --> 14:07.104
- Jude.
- Honey.

14:07.138 --> 14:11.108
You've had time to process
this. He just needs some, too.

14:19.050 --> 14:22.019
That is why I want to go
with an anonymous donor.

14:23.221 --> 14:27.090
Well, what if Timothy
would agree to be anonymous?

14:27.125 --> 14:28.192
There are contracts.

14:28.226 --> 14:31.929
We don't even know if
Timothy is interested.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.968
Or do we?

14:38.002 --> 14:41.805
He, uh... he mentioned
it, after that dinner.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.007
That's great.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.210
Tell you what, why don't you give me a ring

14:46.244 --> 14:49.079
when the baby is born and I'll swing
by the hospital and pick you up.

14:49.113 --> 14:51.181
- Unless you already have a ride?
- Honey.

14:51.216 --> 14:53.884
- I have to get to work.
- Stef!

14:59.240 --> 15:01.909
What, you don't trust
your business partner?

15:01.943 --> 15:03.827
- We're not business partners.
- We could be.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.996
We've already got ten new clients lined up

15:06.030 --> 15:07.965
ready to fork over twice
what the first batch paid.

15:07.999 --> 15:10.200
If you don't do it, I'm going into
business with my buddy at Coronado Springs.

15:10.235 --> 15:13.237
Just go for it. I'm out.

15:13.271 --> 15:17.774
Ok, but, I don't trust
him as much as I trust you.

15:17.809 --> 15:19.142
Not my problem.

15:21.179 --> 15:23.046
It could be.

15:23.080 --> 15:28.018
Considering one of my new clients is her.

15:33.258 --> 15:35.258
Hey, man, I need your help.

15:35.276 --> 15:36.894
Hey, dude, have you seen Callie?

15:36.928 --> 15:39.229
- Lexi's here.
- I thought she was back in Honduras.

15:39.263 --> 15:42.098
So did I. And I kissed
Emma, and I liked it.

15:42.116 --> 15:44.795
And I was going to break up
with Lexi, but now I'm not sure.

15:44.804 --> 15:46.054
And Lexi totally wants to
have sex, like, tonight...

15:46.089 --> 15:47.923
Yeah, that's fine. My dad's at work,

15:47.974 --> 15:49.040
I'm not home 'til after six.

15:49.058 --> 15:51.093
Just don't do it on my bed.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.050
A fake ID? Really?

16:00.720 --> 16:01.820
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:01.855 --> 16:03.922
- Don't lie to me.
- Wow!

16:03.957 --> 16:06.859
That is rich coming from you.

16:06.893 --> 16:08.026
What?

16:08.061 --> 16:11.830
I know you were at school
the night of my photo shoot.

16:11.865 --> 16:14.099
And now I know why you were here.

16:14.133 --> 16:16.802
Making fake IDs in the office.

16:16.836 --> 16:20.005
Look... I didn't want to get you involved.

16:20.039 --> 16:21.907
Did you steal the e-readers, too?

16:21.941 --> 16:25.711
Vico did. I didn't know anything.

16:25.745 --> 16:27.779
I accused Daphne of taking them!

16:27.814 --> 16:28.847
I made him bring 'em back.

16:28.882 --> 16:30.716
Too late. I told Stef and Lena,

16:30.750 --> 16:33.886
- and now they think she did it.
- I'm sorry.

16:35.138 --> 16:37.756
I lost a friend because of you.

16:37.774 --> 16:38.974
What am I supposed to do?

16:39.025 --> 16:41.109
Why are you selling fake IDs?

16:41.144 --> 16:43.161
- I needed the money.
- What for?

16:46.933 --> 16:48.901
I can't tell you that.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.905
I'm sorry.

16:52.939 --> 16:56.008
No, I am.

16:58.011 --> 17:00.879
I don't even know who you are anymore.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.181
Hey, did you get my text?

17:12.232 --> 17:14.316
Yup, emojis and all.

17:14.351 --> 17:16.402
I had no idea you had such school spirit.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.487
Yeah, well, it's my brother's
first time competing.

17:18.521 --> 17:21.357
Um, I kinda got a little carried away.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.325
But, can you come? Lexi
and I are gonna make

17:23.359 --> 17:26.194
giant cards that spell out his
name, and we need you to hold one.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.347
I'm supposed to go
straight home after school.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.648
Please, he needs all
the support he can get.

17:29.683 --> 17:32.518
Emma broke her finger,
and now he's gotta wrestle.

17:32.552 --> 17:38.323
And, um... after I was thinking
maybe we could all go out.

17:38.341 --> 17:44.330
You, me, Lexi, Jesus. Just
four people. Hangin' out.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.664
In a totally non-weird way.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.335
Yeah, so I just got this in today.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.686
It looks totally legit, right?

17:52.472 --> 17:54.506
Hey.

17:54.524 --> 17:55.607
I need to talk to you.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.558
Vigo sent me.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.277
Yeah, it sucks, but I guess

17:58.344 --> 18:00.412
one of the fakes got
confiscated last night at a bar.

18:00.447 --> 18:04.350
Bouncer called the kid's parents and
everything so we're gonna need to get 'em back.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.236
- Seriously?
- Yeah, they're totally a bust.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.622
But, uh, don't worry I'll
get you your money back.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.541
Here you go.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.192
No, spread the word, ok?

18:14.210 --> 18:16.428
We don't want anyone else
getting caught, right?

18:24.587 --> 18:26.505
All right, let's count it out...

18:26.539 --> 18:29.558
One, two, three, four,

18:29.592 --> 18:33.228
five, six, seven, eight...

18:37.517 --> 18:40.269
Don't worry, you're not wrestling that guy.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.404
Whew, thank God.

18:42.439 --> 18:45.657
You... are wrestling him.

18:47.444 --> 18:49.227
The human pretzel?

18:49.245 --> 18:51.530
He's slippery, but you can take him.

18:51.564 --> 18:55.584
- I'm sorry about...
- Yeah, whatcha gonna do?

18:55.618 --> 19:00.205
But hey, big day, your
first time competing.

19:00.239 --> 19:02.508
- How do you feel?
- Nauseous.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.575
Eh...

19:04.611 --> 19:08.547
- Listen, about Lexi...
- Lexi who?

19:10.216 --> 19:14.269
Out here, I'm not a girl. Remember?

19:15.305 --> 19:18.257
I was gonna break up with her, but...

19:18.291 --> 19:19.425
But what?

19:19.459 --> 19:21.426
She came all the way from Honduras.

19:21.444 --> 19:23.195
Maybe that's a good thing.

19:23.229 --> 19:29.201
I mean, if it were me, I'd rather
be broken up with in person.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.656
Who are you texting?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.576
Oh. Um... Daphne.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.577
_

19:38.710 --> 19:41.930
Telling her that the Kindles were returned.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.583
She didn't take them.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.670
Don't you think it's a
little suspicious, honey?

19:48.721 --> 19:53.291
That you confronted her and the
very next day they reappeared?

19:53.309 --> 19:56.595
Our concern is that you're
in a vulnerable position.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.647
We all are.

19:58.681 --> 20:02.601
The court was hesitant to
let you come home so soon.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.370
And we... we're all on probation.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.674
Principal Sanchez has to fill out
your progress reports at school,

20:08.708 --> 20:12.311
and we can't control the way
she perceives certain things.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.279
Like the company you keep.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.615
What are you saying?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.685
I can't be friends with Daphne and Kiara?

20:19.719 --> 20:24.323
No, of course you can,
just at a distance for now.

20:24.357 --> 20:28.627
At least until your adoption goes
through and we're your legal parents.

20:28.661 --> 20:33.348
So I have to make nice
with the privileged kids

20:33.383 --> 20:36.435
because they're the right kind of company.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.637
Even though they're probably
the ones who stole the stuff.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.673
We understand this is confusing, Callie...

20:41.708 --> 20:46.311
No, I'm not confused. This is
exactly how the system works.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.648
Can I go sit with Mariana?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.750
- Callie...
- Sure, honey.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.225
- She's not wrong.
- No. But neither are we.

21:02.579 --> 21:04.413
- Hey.
- Hey!

21:04.464 --> 21:05.714
- Hi.
- Hey.

21:05.748 --> 21:08.634
Oh, my God, I can't wait to see
his butt in that little leotard.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.253
Ok, A: it's called a singlet.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.705
And B: may have just thrown
up a little bit in my mouth.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.717
- Nervous?
- A little bit.

21:25.752 --> 21:30.589
Good. Harness that energy, and
focus. Focus is key. Got it?

21:30.623 --> 21:33.358
- I got it.
- All right.

22:07.752 --> 22:09.586
Come on...

22:11.722 --> 22:13.423
- Come on!
- Get up!

22:13.457 --> 22:14.758
Ok, so there's an escape, that's one point,

22:14.792 --> 22:16.826
a reversal, which is worth two,

22:16.861 --> 22:18.795
and then there's something
called a near fall,

22:18.829 --> 22:21.498
which varies points-wise,
and as far as I can tell,

22:21.532 --> 22:23.833
kinda just looks like
sitting on someone's head.

22:23.868 --> 22:26.770
So, basically, we still have
no idea how the scoring works.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.438
Yeah, not a clue.

22:36.684 --> 22:37.684
_

22:42.385 --> 22:44.685
_

22:51.679 --> 22:52.796
Two points!

22:56.200 --> 22:59.257
_

22:59.687 --> 23:00.770
Hey, am I too late?

23:00.805 --> 23:02.839
No, thank God. Here you go.

23:02.857 --> 23:04.641
What is it?

23:04.675 --> 23:07.777
- A "J." Sit next to Callie.
- Ok.

23:11.615 --> 23:13.516
Ok, so everybody has their cards,

23:13.551 --> 23:16.586
so when it's Jesus's turn we're
all gonna hold them up. Ok?

23:22.877 --> 23:24.861
Take down!

23:31.502 --> 23:33.470
Oh!

23:33.504 --> 23:35.422
Should we be worried?
Why am I suddenly worried?

23:35.473 --> 23:38.808
Because our son's about
to go into mortal combat.

23:38.843 --> 23:40.760
Did we make a mistake, letting him do this?

23:40.811 --> 23:42.812
No, it's been good for him.

23:42.847 --> 23:44.848
He was just so jumpy this morning.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.883
- Was he?
- Yeah, I mean...

23:46.901 --> 23:48.651
He would come to us, right?

23:48.686 --> 23:50.854
If he wanted to get back on his medication.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.439
There's no shame in that.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.624
Not for us. But... for him?

24:03.434 --> 24:06.536
He has a... certain charisma.

24:08.456 --> 24:10.440
He's really popular with the students.

24:10.474 --> 24:13.743
He's certainly attractive.

24:13.778 --> 24:16.646
- He's a Rhodes Scholar.
- Scholar, I remember that.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.815
And he's an animal lover, too.

24:21.469 --> 24:25.422
He also published a novel when
he was 29, and he plays the sitar.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.558
What is that?

24:29.693 --> 24:31.795
It's like an Indian guitar, or something.

24:31.829 --> 24:33.430
Honestly, I have no idea what it is.

24:33.464 --> 24:34.898
But it's really cool, don't you think?

24:44.742 --> 24:47.911
- And he's kind?
- Very.

24:54.552 --> 24:56.753
And... takes the match.

25:05.813 --> 25:07.564
Alright, Jesus, you're up.

25:07.598 --> 25:10.483
All you gotta do is keep Palomar
off the board and we've got this.

25:10.518 --> 25:11.634
The board?

25:11.652 --> 25:13.436
Scoreboard, Foster.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.737
I just put us in the lead.

25:15.773 --> 25:18.525
So don't blow it.

25:18.576 --> 25:22.445
Just stay off your back and you'll be fine.

25:33.858 --> 25:36.526
Go get 'em, Jesus.

25:40.564 --> 25:41.898
Ok, now! Ready?

25:41.932 --> 25:44.500
Whoo!

25:44.935 --> 25:46.836
Jesus!

26:09.743 --> 26:11.661
What's he doing out there?

26:11.695 --> 26:14.547
Come on, focus up, Foster,
we're running out of time.

26:39.523 --> 26:41.658
no points.

26:41.692 --> 26:45.561
Hey, kid. You ok? You hurt?

26:50.534 --> 26:51.568
Hey, coach?

26:53.671 --> 26:55.571
We'll take an injury time-out.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.458
Foster, what gives? You good?

26:59.543 --> 27:01.377
Listen to me, you gotta make a choice,

27:01.412 --> 27:02.512
you gotta make it now.

27:02.546 --> 27:05.515
It's win or lose. It's up to you, Foster.

27:05.549 --> 27:07.383
So what do you want?

27:07.418 --> 27:10.687
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...

27:12.422 --> 27:14.624
Whoo!

27:14.658 --> 27:16.809
Let's go get 'em.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.531
Jesus, Jesus...

27:26.436 --> 27:27.620
One! Escape!

27:27.655 --> 27:29.405
Yes!

27:37.748 --> 27:40.617
- Nice!
- Two points.

27:40.651 --> 27:42.502
That a boy!

27:54.631 --> 27:55.798
Get out of there!

28:01.488 --> 28:02.638
Pin!

28:02.656 --> 28:05.358
- Yes!
- Match to Anchor Beach.

28:23.427 --> 28:26.496
Anchor Beach takes the meet, 27-20.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.116
_

28:47.216 --> 28:51.109
_

29:24.027 --> 29:25.394
What's wrong? Are you ok?

29:26.463 --> 29:28.130
Yeah.

29:34.137 --> 29:38.991
So, I wanted you to know,
I bought back all the IDs.

29:39.025 --> 29:42.311
Well, as many as I could.
And I destroyed them.

29:44.281 --> 29:46.115
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

29:47.417 --> 29:50.152
I stopped going to piano for a few weeks,

29:50.187 --> 29:53.222
but I kept my dad's money.
And I need to pay it back.

29:53.256 --> 29:56.292
- Why did you do that?
- For you.

29:57.494 --> 30:00.129
For your apartment.

30:00.163 --> 30:01.997
When you were going
into independent living.

30:02.032 --> 30:06.135
I... wanted to make sure you
had everything you needed.

30:06.169 --> 30:08.037
You shouldn't have done that.

30:08.071 --> 30:10.172
I would've done anything to help you.

30:11.341 --> 30:13.108
And I still will.

30:14.110 --> 30:17.446
Because you do know who I am.

30:20.183 --> 30:24.019
- How exciting was that?!
- That was amazing!

30:24.037 --> 30:25.187
It was.

30:25.205 --> 30:27.323
Oh, my gosh.

30:29.209 --> 30:32.027
You were really great out there, Foster.

30:32.045 --> 30:33.462
Thanks, that means a lot.

30:36.466 --> 30:39.068
Listen, um...

30:39.102 --> 30:40.202
I know.

30:42.072 --> 30:43.506
You're not gonna break up with Lexi.

30:45.342 --> 30:51.080
I may be benched... but I'm not blind.

30:51.114 --> 30:53.048
I really like you.

30:53.450 --> 30:55.284
But I love Lexi.

30:57.053 --> 31:00.322
- And I told her I'd wait.
- I get it.

31:21.461 --> 31:23.345
Let's go get the car, you guys, come on.

31:23.380 --> 31:27.082
I've, um... I've got
somewhere we can be alone.

31:37.277 --> 31:39.395
- Ok, see ya.
- Hey, wait. Why the rush?

31:39.429 --> 31:43.115
Sorry, I just... I gotta get home.

31:43.149 --> 31:47.069
Oh, ok. I just, I thought, you know...

31:47.103 --> 31:50.239
Maybe we could all... you know?

31:51.508 --> 31:56.078
Is this... are we, like, on a date?

31:57.180 --> 32:00.983
Well, no, I mean...

32:01.017 --> 32:02.384
unless you want it to be a date.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.189
What're you doing?

32:07.223 --> 32:10.192
Just... looking through
my pockets, for panties.

32:10.226 --> 32:12.461
Oh, very funny. You know, forget it.

32:23.490 --> 32:26.158
Ok, so...

32:26.192 --> 32:28.277
Do you wanna go on a real date?

32:28.311 --> 32:30.479
One we both know we're on?

32:31.364 --> 32:33.048
Uh-huh.

32:38.505 --> 32:40.155
Zachary!

32:40.190 --> 32:43.125
Get in the car, right now.

32:44.327 --> 32:46.462
- I... I gotta go.
- Who is that?

32:46.496 --> 32:50.499
- My mom. Sorry.
- Now!

32:59.142 --> 33:00.442
You're telling people our IDs don't work?

33:00.477 --> 33:03.278
- I changed my mind.
- Well, I didn't change mine!

33:03.313 --> 33:06.065
It's a felony, Vico. I did us both a favor.

33:06.116 --> 33:08.150
Oh, yeah? Well, now I'm
gonna return the favor.

33:08.184 --> 33:10.285
- What does that mean?
- Nobody screws me over.

33:47.407 --> 33:51.393
Uh, wait, wait. I think we need to talk.

33:51.428 --> 33:53.112
About what?

33:56.332 --> 33:59.368
I kissed someone. Back in Honduras.

34:00.303 --> 34:04.139
You... who?

34:04.174 --> 34:08.277
This... boy.

34:08.311 --> 34:14.049
I don't even know if it... it'll turn
into anything, but I wanted you to know.

34:15.485 --> 34:19.154
- So what does this mean?
- Maybe it's just too hard.

34:23.092 --> 34:27.262
You know? To wait.

34:27.297 --> 34:31.132
- But I love you.
- I love you, too.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.270
But I really think we need to break up.

34:51.103 --> 34:53.871
Lexi, come on, you don't have to do this.

34:53.907 --> 34:57.109
What, I'm gonna stay here? I just
broke up with your brother, Mariana.

34:57.143 --> 35:00.946
Ok, fine, but you don't have
to go all the way to Honduras.

35:00.964 --> 35:03.165
I mean, we were supposed
to have a whole week to...

35:03.216 --> 35:06.785
I can't... I'm sorry.

35:07.921 --> 35:09.922
I just need to go home.

35:11.124 --> 35:13.092
Can I just ask...

35:14.294 --> 35:16.095
Is there really a boy in Honduras?

35:19.833 --> 35:21.033
There will be.

35:34.214 --> 35:38.117
Oh, hey! Sorry to just barge in like this.

35:38.151 --> 35:41.220
Your dad gave me a key so
I could get dinner started.

35:41.254 --> 35:44.056
Lasagna! Your favorite, right?

35:44.090 --> 35:48.961
That's really nice, um, but I kinda
need to talk to my dad when he gets home.

35:51.164 --> 35:53.799
Alone.

35:53.833 --> 35:59.138
Ok... sounds serious.
Anything you wanna tell me?

36:00.273 --> 36:02.841
I think you know you can
trust me with a secret.

36:02.876 --> 36:04.043
Maybe I can help.

36:07.914 --> 36:09.915
I owe my dad 900 dollars.

36:11.885 --> 36:13.986
He hasn't mentioned that.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.954
Because he doesn't know.

36:21.961 --> 36:24.129
Hey. Why didn't you just ring the doorbell?

36:25.098 --> 36:27.166
I just... I can't stay long.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.969
Oh, well, based on your lack of emojis,
I'm assuming it's something serious.

36:31.004 --> 36:32.805
Yeah...

36:33.173 --> 36:35.274
I, um...

36:35.308 --> 36:39.144
I just... I think that
we should just be friends.

36:41.915 --> 36:43.282
Why?

36:43.316 --> 36:46.819
I just, I have a lot of
commitments right now and...

36:46.853 --> 36:48.153
I just don't think...

36:48.188 --> 36:49.988
Is this because of your mom, or something?

36:50.023 --> 36:51.824
- Was she mad?
- No!

36:51.858 --> 36:55.828
No, it doesn't have anything
to do with her. It's me.

36:55.862 --> 36:59.231
I just... I don't have time
for a girlfriend right now.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.968
So I'm... I'm sorry.

37:13.279 --> 37:14.963
Hey.

37:15.014 --> 37:17.082
How come it says "T.J.?"

37:18.284 --> 37:22.087
Dad's name is Donald.

37:22.138 --> 37:25.257
Those are grandpa's initials: Thomas Jacob.

37:28.027 --> 37:30.129
Did I ever meet him?

37:30.163 --> 37:35.000
When you were really little.
He died pretty young though.

37:38.872 --> 37:40.839
Hey, um...

37:40.874 --> 37:44.243
I should have told you
that Dad's out of prison.

37:45.945 --> 37:48.080
I'm sorry.

37:48.114 --> 37:51.950
I just thought, the more
you know, the more it hurts.

37:53.987 --> 37:56.955
Yeah, well, not knowing sucks.

38:00.026 --> 38:02.194
We're better off without him.

38:02.228 --> 38:04.029
I know.

38:08.234 --> 38:11.803
- Hey there.
- Everything ok?

38:11.821 --> 38:14.806
- Yeah. We're ok.
- Good.

38:14.841 --> 38:20.012
So, listen, the adoption
lawyer has found your father.

38:20.046 --> 38:21.947
Where?

38:21.981 --> 38:24.883
Not far from here, actually. North Park.

38:26.052 --> 38:27.853
Now the lawyer spoke to your father,

38:27.887 --> 38:31.823
and he has agreed to sign
away his parental rights.

38:32.926 --> 38:34.159
That's good.

38:34.194 --> 38:36.195
But the lawyer would like to know

38:36.229 --> 38:38.931
if you two would like
to see your father first.

38:38.965 --> 38:40.999
Oh, we don't.

38:43.203 --> 38:44.236
I do.

38:46.839 --> 38:48.106
Jude...

38:48.141 --> 38:51.109
You don't have to. But I wanna see my dad.

38:55.782 --> 38:58.083
You're probably gonna
ground me, or whatever.

38:59.152 --> 39:01.119
But I just wanted to tell you the truth.

39:02.889 --> 39:04.856
I'm glad you told me.

39:06.125 --> 39:08.160
So, what did you do with the money,

39:08.194 --> 39:10.829
since you didn't give it to Callie?

39:24.010 --> 39:25.210
Thanks.

39:30.183 --> 39:31.817
I'm sorry, Dad.

39:42.028 --> 39:46.265
I can't believe he did
this. It's so not like him.

39:48.134 --> 39:51.103
Frankly, I'm surprised he
hasn't acted out before now.

39:53.906 --> 39:55.007
What's that supposed mean?

39:55.041 --> 39:57.175
Imagine how he must have felt

39:57.210 --> 39:58.977
when Stef and Lena moved in the twins.

39:59.012 --> 40:02.848
He went from being an only child
to having two instant siblings.

40:02.882 --> 40:05.083
And now they've done it again
with and Callie and Jude.

40:05.118 --> 40:08.120
It's just another reason
why he needs to be with us.

40:08.154 --> 40:10.222
Before he makes another bad decision.

40:12.191 --> 40:13.925
Should we be worried?

40:14.894 --> 40:18.163
About... Jude seeing his father?

40:20.266 --> 40:23.969
He just needs closure. I
think it's a good thing.

40:24.003 --> 40:26.204
I think Callie could use some, too.

40:26.239 --> 40:29.007
You think she'll change
her mind about seeing him?

40:31.110 --> 40:33.078
She's pretty angry.

40:42.021 --> 40:43.955
Am I crazy?

40:45.224 --> 40:47.159
Is this a trick question?

40:48.995 --> 40:52.864
To want to have a baby when
we've got all these kids?

40:55.301 --> 41:01.106
All these kids... are
gonna be off to college,

41:01.140 --> 41:03.942
hopefully, in a few years.

41:03.976 --> 41:06.044
The house is gonna seem
awfully empty, I think.

41:11.250 --> 41:14.019
If you want to use Timothy,

41:14.087 --> 41:17.189
I think we should...

41:17.223 --> 41:21.893
get together, all three
of us, and talk about it.

41:24.097 --> 41:25.931
Really?

41:30.069 --> 41:31.303
Yeah, really.

41:44.183 --> 41:47.018
What time do we have to
pick Callie up from group?

41:48.204 --> 41:50.088
About an hour. We've got time.

41:50.123 --> 41:53.925
Time for what... Mrs. Adams Foster?

42:26.058 --> 42:28.126
You look just like your mother.
