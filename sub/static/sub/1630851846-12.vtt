for the Smith family picnic.

If we want to picnic
on the family gravesite,

00:17.669 --> 00:19.584
we need butts on blankets
by sunset,

00:19.628 --> 00:20.803

00:20.846 --> 00:24.502

00:24.546 --> 00:26.243

how people do that.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.681
Wow!
The view up here is amazing.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.553
It better be.

00:31.596 --> 00:34.556
It's the swankiest neighborhood
in the whole cemetery.

00:34.599 --> 00:38.081
Can you imagine being buried
down there by the restrooms?

00:38.125 --> 00:40.997
That's where the runoff
from our bodies ends up.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.087

01:02.192 --> 01:04.542
All right, I think I may know
what happened here.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.502
Little while ago, I sold
our plots for some quick cash.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.939
I was planning to buy them back
before we needed them,

01:09.982 --> 01:12.115
but apparently, someone's family

01:12.159 --> 01:13.943
had to go and walk
into a mass tragedy.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.119
Yeah, <i>our</i> family!

01:16.163 --> 01:19.122
Dad, my grave was
the one nice thing I owned.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.732
How could you do this?

01:20.776 --> 01:23.561
To buy the sweet Sea-Doos
we'll all be enjoying.

01:23.605 --> 01:26.129
Soon as I sell a few things, get
some quick cash for a trailer.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.262
But who wants Jet Skis?!

01:28.305 --> 01:30.133
We want our graves!

that comes

01:31.613 --> 01:33.658

Not every one of them
is gonna be a home run.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.271
Stan, fix it.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.316

This looks like a done deal.

Deep Danger.</i>

07:17.045 --> 07:18.525
Then it's settled.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.223
We need NBA Hall of Famer
Scottie Pippen

- to save our cemetery.
- Do we, though?

Scottie Pippen instead.

to save the cemetery?

a really good choice.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.044

thought of that.

Maybe they're right about me.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.923
that without the family around
to doubt you,

yourself a little?

08:10.794 --> 08:13.580
No way.
Then again, what do I know?

of <i>your</i> ideas, and I meant it.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.299
I mean, that's gotta be
a red flag, right?

08:18.323 --> 08:20.151

that everything can ride on.

[deep voice] How did you
get to that one?

18:10.393 --> 18:12.874
What'll you have?
I'll take a cranberry juice.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.790
So, any skeletons in the closet
I should know about?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.487
[laughs]

18:19.272 --> 18:21.012
Oh. Hello.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.058
[gasps]

18:23.102 --> 18:25.408
Janeane!
Who the hell is this?

18:25.452 --> 18:27.454
You know I hate it
when you flirt with other men.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.369
Now, shut up forever
and kiss me.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.370
[exhales]

18:30.413 --> 18:31.719
[inhales deeply]

18:34.678 --> 18:36.332
[gulping]

18:36.376 --> 18:37.681
- Whoo-hoo!
- [glass shatters]

18:37.725 --> 18:39.640
Your club is sick,

18:39.683 --> 18:42.425
and I mean that in the way
I think my son means it.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.123
A-plus inspection.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.342
That's great news.
Thank you for coming.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.952
Ooh, and I'd love
to get the number

18:47.996 --> 18:49.539
of that little lady
I met in the cabana.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.521
I didn't catch her name,

18:51.565 --> 18:55.569
but we didn't exactly do much
talking if yaknowwhaddamean.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.659
Yes!
We pulled it off!

18:58.702 --> 19:00.182
I don't understand.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.315
I succeeded, but I don't
have my confidence back.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.491
Well, Stan, it was more
of <i>my</i> success.

19:04.534 --> 19:09.278
Stan, why did you try
to torpedo our cemetery?

19:09.322 --> 19:12.412
Torpedo is a underwater gun.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.328
You said we could decide things
for ourselves,

19:15.371 --> 19:17.678
but when we did, you hated
that we were succeeding.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.288
Of course I did!

19:19.332 --> 19:21.290
You were all doing so well
without me, and...

19:21.334 --> 19:23.292
I got scared.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.686
I started thinking maybe you
don't need Ol' Stanny-Two-Puns

19:25.729 --> 19:28.384
and his dumb decisions
to kick around anymore.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.995
But I swear, I wasn't
trying to sabotage you.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.606
Aww, Stan.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.435
You're more than just
your decisions to us.

19:35.478 --> 19:38.394
You're also the guy we get
to blame when they go wrong.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.048
We need that.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.398
Yeah, honestly,
that was a way easier system.

19:42.442 --> 19:46.010
Dad, we were sorta hoping maybe
you'd take the reins again.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.491
But it seemed like things
were going so well for you.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.077
You don't want to keep
doing your cemetery?

19:50.101 --> 19:51.494
- We hated it!
- So many guts!

19:51.538 --> 19:53.453
I think it's affecting
our groundwater.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.151
Well, I don't want to run
a club, especially with Klaus.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.459
Because you don't want business
to ruin our friendship?

19:59.502 --> 20:00.503
Was that an option?

20:00.547 --> 20:02.940
Baby, we want you back.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.205
But of course,
it's your decision.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.858
I'll do it.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.862
Now, what are you gonna do
with all these bodies?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.299
Yeah, Dad, what the hell?

20:13.342 --> 20:14.256
Don't worry.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.300
I got this.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.305
You sure you're okay with this,
Scottie Pippen?

20:19.348 --> 20:22.133
You bet.
The sea will take care of me.

20:22.177 --> 20:25.311
That's why they always
call me The Admiral.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.704
- Wasn't that David Robinson?
- Who knows?

20:27.748 --> 20:31.186
I will return when I have
written my next masterpiece.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.845
See?
Not all my ideas are bad.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.368
I got rid of the bodies,

20:39.412 --> 20:41.588
and we can be buried
in our own backyard.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.242
Two birds, one stone.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.505
More like one <i>tombstone!</i>

20:45.548 --> 20:47.637
[laughter]

20:47.681 --> 20:50.161
Another all-timer, Roger!

20:50.205 --> 20:51.728
Where do you come up with these?

20:51.772 --> 20:54.122
My spectacular imagination!

20:54.165 --> 20:56.298
What the ffff...

20:56.342 --> 20:58.300
Have a great night!
