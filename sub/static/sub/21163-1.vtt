a little bit about your girlfriend,

Well, let's see. She's a bold woman.
She's very strong, very passionate.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.809
She's refined. She sort of enjoys
the finer things in life.

12:45.890 --> 12:46.890
Oh.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.805

She's worldly.

We custom-make these.

You can do:
"Hey, sweetie, I love your style,"

"Ooh, mama, you're really
turning me on over here,"

13:09.747 --> 13:13.077
"Yo, hit me up online,
I'll shoot you an email sometime, honey."

13:13.167 --> 13:18.087
Every example I've given is too big to fit
on a little candy like this,

13:18.172 --> 13:19.672

"Hey, sweetie. Happy Valentine's Day."

-Another service we have here is,

14:22.945 --> 14:25.155

47:33.976 --> 47:37.936
<i>♪ I know exactly how it feels ♪</i>

47:39.440 --> 47:42.230
<i>♪ 'Cause, baby ♪</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:46.280

47:46.363 --> 47:48.743
[holding note]

47:48.824 --> 47:50.794
He's doing it!

47:50.868 --> 47:53.038
[rumbling, wind whistling]

47:53.120 --> 47:55.210
[man] It's so close.
I think we're gonna make it.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.011
[coughs weakly]

48:07.343 --> 48:08.343
[rumbling stops]

48:09.178 --> 48:10.968
Did we make it?

48:11.055 --> 48:13.095
Michael, you did all you could.

48:13.182 --> 48:15.232
We just ran out of fertile women.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.650
[whispers] I'm sorry, Michael.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.114
[woman]
I think you're forgetting someone.

48:23.818 --> 48:27.818
Carmela. But what are you doing here?
I thought you'd left me.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.155
No!

48:29.240 --> 48:34.410
Why would I leave the father
of our new baby boy?

48:35.454 --> 48:37.294
That's what your text meant?

48:37.373 --> 48:40.133
There's a new man in your life
and he's inside you?

48:40.209 --> 48:44.299
Yes! I can think of no better way
to phrase that.

48:45.923 --> 48:46.923
[Carmela] Mwah!

48:47.007 --> 48:48.967
[alarm ringing]

48:49.051 --> 48:51.471
Holy shit, Michael! We did it!

48:51.554 --> 48:53.684
[all cheering]

48:53.764 --> 48:55.984
Whatever this is, we saved it!

48:56.559 --> 48:58.099
Unbelievable!

48:58.936 --> 49:02.896
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to kill Santa Claus.

49:02.982 --> 49:05.482
I meant to kill you-- Michael Bolton.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.697
[rumbling]

49:09.989 --> 49:10.989
[grunts]

49:11.073 --> 49:13.953
Ho ho... whoa!

49:14.034 --> 49:16.124
Of course. <i>The Santa Clause!</i>

49:16.203 --> 49:18.213
-What?
-I don't understand any of this.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.709
Tim Allen. Disney. 1994.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.671
Wally killed Santa. Now he <i>is </i> Santa.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.302
That's right.
And, Michael, you've done it.

49:26.380 --> 49:27.920
You've saved Christmas.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.967
I'm so happy this happened.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.300
[all cheering]

49:31.385 --> 49:32.385
Rock on, Bolton.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.139
[laughing]

49:34.221 --> 49:38.391
All hail Lord Boltron,
the king of Valentine's Day.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.596
[cheering and applauding]

49:41.604 --> 49:42.694
[laughing]

49:42.771 --> 49:43.981
You're free to go.

50:00.080 --> 50:01.460
[music playing]

52:44.036 --> 52:47.956
Oh, hello. You just caught me looking
at my little black book.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.580
A lot of names and memories in this.

52:51.543 --> 52:53.673
Yes. Carrie.

52:53.754 --> 52:56.224
Oh. Rebecca.

52:56.298 --> 53:00.048
Amelie. You're so sweet and innocent.

53:00.135 --> 53:02.005
Princess Mononoke.

53:02.679 --> 53:04.259
Unforgettable.

53:04.973 --> 53:07.183
And, of course, <i>The French Connection.</i>

53:07.267 --> 53:09.187
What a car chase.

53:09.269 --> 53:12.059
Yes, this is my little black book
of movies.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.187
[clown horn blows]

53:13.273 --> 53:16.153
Oh, boy!
That sound can only mean one thing:

53:16.235 --> 53:18.065
The Dancing Cupids!

53:18.153 --> 53:19.453
[jazz music playing]

53:28.914 --> 53:30.584
So fucking good.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.335
This is my favorite part. Watch this part.

53:44.179 --> 53:46.309
I actually had to talk to the execs
about keeping them.

53:46.390 --> 53:47.810
They were thinking of cutting them.

53:48.475 --> 53:50.805
I said, "You cut them, you cut me,
'cause I'm gone."

53:58.193 --> 53:59.653
[song ends]

53:59.736 --> 54:01.106
