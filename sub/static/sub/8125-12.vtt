From television city

00:04.904 --> 00:08.473
¶ Boy, the way
Glenn Miller played ¶

00:08.540 --> 00:12.210
¶ songs that made
the hit parade ¶

00:12.277 --> 00:15.981

01:02.928 --> 01:05.930
you know,
my lips are starting
to stick together.

01:05.998 --> 01:07.932
This glue
tastes terrible.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.702
Mmm, these cherry-flavored
envelopes taste great.
Yeah ?

01:10.770 --> 01:12.704
Yeah.
Let me have a taste.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.373
Here.
Not that way.

01:16.508 --> 01:19.343
Mmm, yeah.
I can taste the cherry.

01:20.612 --> 01:24.115
Yeah, and I can taste
the post office.
Let go.

01:24.183 --> 01:26.584
I can't. I'm stuck.

01:26.652 --> 01:28.586
Michael,
I can't breathe.

01:28.654 --> 01:32.157
That's all right.
This is a great way to go.
We'll just stay like this.

01:32.224 --> 01:35.393
Don't mind me.
Just go right on talkin'.

01:36.628 --> 01:39.463
I got the stew on,
so I can help you now.

01:39.531 --> 01:43.101
Good.
I'm a very good
licker and stamper.

01:43.169 --> 01:47.371
When I worked for
the Hercules plumbing company
before I got married,

01:47.439 --> 01:52.077
I used to lick all
the first-of-the-month
envelopes myself.

01:52.144 --> 01:55.246
And then they changed
their billing date
to the 15th,

01:55.314 --> 01:58.083
and they asked
somebody else to do it.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.252
Why didn't you do it
on the 15th, ma ?

02:01.320 --> 02:04.288
Because I only worked there
two weeks.

02:06.992 --> 02:10.561
Oh, hi, Archie.

02:10.628 --> 02:12.864
You got home early.
[ Gloria ]
Hi, daddy.

02:12.932 --> 02:15.433
[ Mike ] Hi, arch.
Gee, that's
some greeting I get.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.635
Don't all of youse
jump up at once.

02:17.703 --> 02:21.039
Is something wrong,
Archie ?

02:21.107 --> 02:25.009
I tell you,
the milk of human kindness
is dryin' up out there.

02:25.077 --> 02:28.279
I get off the subway,
and I'm crossin' Pearson
street near the park.

02:28.347 --> 02:30.749
A big, dumb cop
comes up to me,

02:30.816 --> 02:33.618
talks to me
about jaywalking,
you know ?

02:33.685 --> 02:37.455
So I put my hand here,
and I tell him I got
a stinging pain here...

02:37.522 --> 02:40.191
Like I'm havin'
a heart attack and I'm
runnin' to the doctor.

02:40.259 --> 02:43.594
What does he do ?
Laughs, gives me a ticket.

02:43.662 --> 02:46.965
But, Archie,
you wasn't havin'
a heart attack.

02:47.032 --> 02:50.135
But, Edith,
he didn't know that.

02:50.202 --> 02:53.471
In today's world,
the milk of human kindness
is curdling.

02:53.538 --> 02:55.473
Ohh.

02:55.540 --> 03:00.578
Poor dear.
Well, now you're home
in the bosom of your family.

03:00.646 --> 03:05.049
All right, all right.
You don't have to maul me.

03:07.386 --> 03:09.320
What are youse two
doing here ?

03:09.388 --> 03:12.623
Don't tell me it's real work
or I'll have a heart attack.

03:12.691 --> 03:15.459
Consider your life spared.
We're not getting paid
for this.

03:15.527 --> 03:17.996
That's right.
This happens to be
something we believe in.

03:18.063 --> 03:23.001
- Man does not live
by bread alone.
- You sure don't.

03:23.068 --> 03:27.172
Not unless the bread's
wrapped around ham, baloney,
liverwurst or salami.

03:27.239 --> 03:30.308
No wonder you're a meathead.
[ Chuckling ]

03:31.911 --> 03:34.946
Let's see
what new subversion
you're fermenting here.

03:35.014 --> 03:38.283
That's my pop,
always there
with an open mind.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.685
Listen, little girl,
my mind's just as open
as yours is,

03:40.752 --> 03:45.190
except when it's closed
'cause the facts of the case
is already known to me.

03:45.257 --> 03:49.294
- Edith, do you know what you're
stuffin' them envelopes with ?
- No, I didn't read it.

03:49.361 --> 03:52.964
Well, you're stuffin'
them envelopes with radical,
liberal garbage.

03:53.032 --> 03:56.201
Why don't you stop
putting labels on things
you don't understand ?

03:56.268 --> 03:58.402
I understand this,
all right.

03:58.470 --> 04:02.874
"Queens free clinic, a place
for the high school dropout,
the teenage runaway,

04:02.942 --> 04:05.944
"that will provide free food,
free medical attention,

04:06.011 --> 04:09.047
free treatment for v.D."

04:09.114 --> 04:12.650
V.D.
You know what that
means, Edith ?

04:12.718 --> 04:17.055
V.D. No, wait.
Don't tell me.

04:19.725 --> 04:23.862
I know it's
someone's initials.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.070
Well, you ask
a dingbat a question,
you get a dingbat answer.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.007
I better go look
at the stew.

04:36.075 --> 04:40.078
I don't know what all this fuss
is about. They have clinics
like this all over the country.

04:40.145 --> 04:42.580
Why should them dropouts
get anything free, huh ?

04:42.647 --> 04:46.985
When I was a kid,
you had to be in the army
to get free shots for v.D.

04:47.052 --> 04:48.987
Don't worry, arch.

04:49.054 --> 04:51.789
I'm sure the army
still gets its share
of the action.

04:51.857 --> 04:55.093
I keep thinking
it had something to do...

04:55.160 --> 04:58.829
With flags and parades
and things.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.831
What did, ma ?

05:00.900 --> 05:05.003
I know !
V.D. Day !

05:10.242 --> 05:12.277
No, Edith.

05:12.344 --> 05:14.845
That was v.E. Day.

05:14.914 --> 05:18.283
Come on, ma.
I'll help you
with supper.

05:18.350 --> 05:21.286
I'll tell you
the "basical" problem
with your dropouts today...

05:21.353 --> 05:24.289
Is they ain't got
no gratitude.

05:24.356 --> 05:26.791
What do you mean ?
No gratitude for what ?

05:26.858 --> 05:28.793
For what they got here.

05:28.860 --> 05:32.363
What do they got here ?
They got the greatest
country in the world here.

05:32.431 --> 05:34.365
Highest standard
of living.

05:34.433 --> 05:37.302
The grossest
national product.

05:37.369 --> 05:41.372
What more do they want
from us anyhow ?
Peace.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.411
One thing they ain't got,
and right away they drop out.

05:46.478 --> 05:49.480
How 'bout pure air ?
How 'bout clean water,
non-contaminated food ?

05:49.548 --> 05:51.849
All right.
How 'bout confidence
in their government ?

05:51.917 --> 05:55.153
All right, will ya ?
We ain't perfect.

05:55.220 --> 05:59.657
This is the United States
of America. It ain't the
perfect states of America.

05:59.724 --> 06:03.394
Dropouts are all
for tearing things down.
Where are their solutions ?

06:03.462 --> 06:05.830
They don't have
any solutions.
You're telling me.

06:05.897 --> 06:08.499
Why should they ?
Archie.

06:08.567 --> 06:12.236
Look at the United States
as a house on fire.

06:12.304 --> 06:15.974
Now, those kids
see the fire,

06:16.041 --> 06:18.843
but they don't have
the equipment
to put it out.

06:18.910 --> 06:22.680
Does that mean
that they shouldn't yell,
"help, fire ! Help, fire !"

06:23.983 --> 06:27.685
You know,
I think you're dead
from the neck up.

06:32.591 --> 06:34.692
Let me tell you
something.

06:34.759 --> 06:39.364
You gotta get these dropouts
and welfare incipients
off the public money.

06:39.431 --> 06:42.200
You'd see how fast
this country
would turn around.

06:42.267 --> 06:45.336
You'd have pure air
and clean water
coming out of your ears.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.473
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>
<i>Okay, fine. I'll get</i>
<i>everyone off of welfare.</i>

06:48.540 --> 06:52.377
I want you to save the taxpayers
a hundred times as much.
Get us out of Vietnam.

06:52.444 --> 06:54.912
Listen, I could settle
Vietnam for you.

06:54.980 --> 06:59.150
First you take delivery
of this package, and then
you settle Vietnam.

06:59.218 --> 07:01.152
Your name bunker ?

07:01.220 --> 07:03.388
That's right.
Archie bunker.

07:03.455 --> 07:07.325
I changed it from lipschitz
for business reasons.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.229
Five years,
I kid one customer,

07:11.296 --> 07:13.831
and it's gotta be him.

07:13.899 --> 07:16.901
What's in the package ?
Let me open it,
will ya ?

07:16.968 --> 07:20.405
Gee, you want me to stop
the war, clean the water,
purify the air...

07:20.472 --> 07:23.141
And see through
wrapping paper.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.976
Oh, who was that
at the door, Archie ?

07:26.045 --> 07:28.979
<i>Just a package</i>
<i>for me, Edith.</i>
<i>Oh, what is it ?</i>

07:29.048 --> 07:32.917
Oh, cigars.
Oh, hey, hey.
These ain't just cigars.

07:32.984 --> 07:35.753
Wait a minute.
These are macanudos.

07:35.820 --> 07:39.690
Gee, these babies cost
a buck a piece.

07:39.758 --> 07:42.260
Gee, Edith.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.595
I ain't had
a dollar cigar since--

07:44.663 --> 07:48.433
you never had
a dollar cigar.
That's right.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.169
Gee, I don't know
who sent them.
There's no card.

07:51.236 --> 07:54.205
I guess whoever sent 'em
wants to remain unanimous
about it.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.541
<i>[ Doorbell rings ]</i>

07:56.608 --> 08:00.211
<i>Edith, these cigars</i>
<i>are the nectarines</i>
<i>of the gods.</i>

08:01.680 --> 08:04.115
My luck.
I got all the way
down to the truck,

08:04.183 --> 08:06.784
and I remembered I had
another package for you.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.454
Oh, Archie !
Hold it, hold it,
everybody.

08:09.521 --> 08:12.223
Don't nobody touch it now
till I sign for it.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.225
There we go.

08:15.694 --> 08:17.628
There.

08:22.267 --> 08:25.669
Heaviest package
I carried all day.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.007
I'll bet you were glad
to put it down then, huh ?

08:36.181 --> 08:38.982
All right.
Go on. Open it up.
See who it's from.

08:39.049 --> 08:40.985
See what it is.
Yeah.

08:41.052 --> 08:43.321
Oh, look !
[ Mike ]
Hey, look at this !

08:43.388 --> 08:45.656
Gee, this is fantastic.
It's beautiful !

08:45.724 --> 08:48.659
Look at the booze in there.
Fois gras, strassburg
and camembert cheese.

08:48.727 --> 08:51.162
Smoked oysters.
Here's a card, daddy.

08:51.230 --> 08:55.566
Beluga caviar, scotch,
bourbon, vodka. There's
nothing but the best here.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.569
The very best.
Look, wheat thins !

09:02.407 --> 09:06.810
Who's it from, Archie ?
I mean, who do we know
could afford this ?

09:06.878 --> 09:09.180
Only one man
in the world, Edith.

09:09.248 --> 09:12.016
Twenty-five years ago,
when I first knew this guy,

09:12.083 --> 09:14.352
he didn't have two nickels
to rub together.

09:14.419 --> 09:17.021
Now he's worth
five million bucks.
Archie, don't tell me.

09:17.088 --> 09:20.591
Eddie Frazier !
Look at the
jilt-edged card.

<i> </i> <i> about Eddie Frazier ?</i>
<i> - A hundred times, daddy.</i>

Good old Eddie Frazier.

09:31.936 --> 09:34.539
[ Both ]
Even way back then I knew
he'd make it big some day.

09:34.606 --> 09:37.642
A real go-getter.
Yes !

automobile dealer west
of the Mississippi,

09:40.111 --> 09:42.213
or maybe
in the whole country.

09:42.281 --> 09:45.049
No matter how big he is,
he still remembers me
at christmastime.

09:45.116 --> 09:48.653
- Always a card.
- The last one was nice.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.191
The three wise men
were riding in
a blue convertible.

Someday you two might be
lucky enough to meet him,
see what America's all about.

10:01.132 --> 10:04.335
He started selling
with nothing but
a secondhand studebaker.

And no conscience.

<i>What's he done except</i>
<i>become a millionaire ?</i>
<i>Ain't that enough ?</i>

10:09.441 --> 10:13.644
No, that ain't enough,
and therein lies the gap
between our generations.

10:13.712 --> 10:17.648
Therein lies the gap
between your ears.

10:20.619 --> 10:24.088

at a man like Eddie Frazier,

10:24.155 --> 10:27.525

your whole generation ?

10:27.593 --> 10:30.695
Okay, so he's rich.
Now, what is he doing
for his fellow man ?

10:31.830 --> 10:34.098
He's paying his taxes.

10:34.165 --> 10:38.035

It's for Mr. Archie bunker.

That's what it sounds like.

Yeah, I'm holding.

We're going to the movies
tomorrow night.
What do you mean ?

13:44.890 --> 13:48.125
Hey, what's the matter ?
You're scared you're gonna
find out you're wrong ?

13:48.192 --> 13:51.962
Are you scared you might
have to admire a guy
with 50 million bucks ?

13:52.030 --> 13:54.732
No movie. You stay here.
Let's get this place cleaned up.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.535
I don't want
my old army buddies to think
we're living like slobs.

13:57.602 --> 14:00.471
And get rid of all this
pinko propaganda, huh ?

14:00.539 --> 14:03.273
Let's clear the decks
for some real Americans.

14:03.341 --> 14:07.277
Listen, Eddie Frazier
is gonna have you eating
out of his hand.

14:07.345 --> 14:09.279

Come on, you guys.
Let's get a little life
in the party.

14:25.396 --> 14:28.332
This ain't like the old

Go on, Billy.

14:28.399 --> 14:31.836
Help yourself
to another drink there.
Have some pretzels, Joe.

14:31.903 --> 14:34.338
I'm Fred.
Fred ! That's right.

14:34.405 --> 14:38.141
There's Joe over there.
Always got these guys
mixed up.

14:38.209 --> 14:41.946
We called them the frouge twins
because they both had
the same last name.

14:42.013 --> 14:44.615
It was Joe frouge
and Fred frouge.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.817
But they ain't related
and they never was.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.819
They don't look alike
and they never did.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.022
But we always got 'em
mixed up just like they
was real twins. Funny ?

14:52.090 --> 14:54.358
[ Forced laughing ]
That's funny !

14:57.061 --> 14:59.830

You know what I
want you to do ?
Edith, come out here.

Edith, this is the funniest

Go ahead, go ahead.

15:13.712 --> 15:16.714
Well, there was
this blind date...

15:16.781 --> 15:19.783
That big John kapawana
fixed me up on.

15:19.851 --> 15:23.286
I went to this girl's house
which I never met.

15:23.354 --> 15:26.624
<i>And her mother</i>
<i>or her sister</i>
<i>come to the door--</i>

15:26.691 --> 15:28.626

15:28.693 --> 15:33.230
And she yelled,
"hey, Josephine,
your date's here !"

15:33.297 --> 15:35.699
And then this girl,
Josephine, come out.

15:42.407 --> 15:44.942
Four months later,
we was married.

15:47.078 --> 15:49.880
What an unusual story.

15:51.482 --> 15:54.418
That ain't the story.
That ain't the way you
met your wife, Billy.

15:54.485 --> 15:57.588
- You didn't tell it right.
- Wait a minute, arch.
You got 'em mixed up.

16:07.231 --> 16:09.833
You see why I get
everything mixed up ?

16:09.901 --> 16:12.102
There was so many stories
about these guys.

16:12.170 --> 16:15.673
They was always
doing something.

- When's Eddie gettin' here ?
- Yeah, when's he comin' ?

16:21.112 --> 16:23.681
- Where's he at ?
- Take it easy. He'll show.

16:23.748 --> 16:26.584
He probably got held up
with some big deal,
you know.

16:26.651 --> 16:29.587
He's a doer.
He's probably doing
something right now.

16:29.654 --> 16:32.122
You remember that time
outside of naples...

16:32.190 --> 16:34.458
When Eddie got a hold
of that Italian printin' press,

16:34.525 --> 16:37.127
and he printed us all up
them three-day passes ?

16:37.195 --> 16:40.130
Hey, he sold so many
of them passes,

16:40.198 --> 16:43.601

who fell out for reveille
was the colonel !

Gee, what a success he is.
And he deserves it.
I'll tell you why.

16:54.012 --> 16:57.982
He's the kind of a guy that
don't lay around waiting
for conditions to get good.

16:58.049 --> 17:02.319
You listen to this, Mike.
He's the kind of a guy that
makes his own conditions.

17:02.386 --> 17:04.821
Yeah, but sometimes
you can't do that,
arch.

17:04.888 --> 17:07.657
We got
a little business--
gravestones.

17:07.726 --> 17:10.493

there's no money around.

You show me a chimpanzee
that can drive,

17:21.740 --> 17:24.508

22:48.299 --> 22:52.336
Now, Greg, listen.
Don't hang up. Greg.
Don't hang up on me.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.307
Oh.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.243
I was just
talkin' to my son.
Great kid.

23:00.311 --> 23:03.646
Great kid.
That boy could have
anything he wants from me.

23:04.949 --> 23:06.883
What does he want
from you ?

23:06.951 --> 23:11.254
Kids today, you know,
they're all this sort of--

23:12.923 --> 23:17.227
he wants me to stay
the hell away from him.

23:17.295 --> 23:19.329
Hey !
<i>Eddie,</i>
<i>come on over here !</i>

23:19.397 --> 23:22.199
We were havin' an argument
about that watch
you're wearin'.

23:22.266 --> 23:24.701
Is that one of them
fancy foreign jobs ?
Nah, that's an old watch.

23:24.768 --> 23:27.704
I had it a long time.
I got it off a dead jap.
A dead jap ?

23:27.771 --> 23:30.307
- You was in Italy with us.
- I didn't get it in the war.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.309
My gardener died.

23:36.047 --> 23:39.383
Hey, you guys.
You know Eddie sprung
for this party, huh ?

23:39.450 --> 23:42.285
So let's have
a little toast to Eddie.
What do you say ?

23:42.353 --> 23:44.721
Hey, what do you say ?
"He's a jolly good fellow" ?

23:44.788 --> 23:48.358
¶ For he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow ¶

23:48.426 --> 23:51.461
¶ for he's a jolly
good fellow ¶

23:51.529 --> 23:53.563
¶ which nobody can deny ¶

23:53.631 --> 23:57.767
¶ which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny ¶

23:57.835 --> 24:01.571
¶ for he's a jolly good fellow
for he's a jolly good fellow ¶

24:01.639 --> 24:04.674
¶ for he's a jolly
good fellow ¶

24:04.742 --> 24:08.245
<i>¶ which nobody can deny ¶</i>

24:21.059 --> 24:23.760
yeah.

24:23.827 --> 24:27.597
I bet you're glad
you didn't go to
no movies tonight.

24:27.665 --> 24:30.767
Oh, yeah.

24:30.834 --> 24:34.438
You met four
of the greatest guys
in the world.

24:36.006 --> 24:38.608
I hope you remember
everything you've seen
tonight.

24:40.611 --> 24:44.081
Don't worry, arch.
I'll never forget it.

24:44.148 --> 24:46.083
Yeah.

24:46.150 --> 24:49.286
¶ Bless them all ¶

24:49.353 --> 24:51.621
¶ the long
and the short ¶

24:51.689 --> 24:54.791
¶ and the tall ¶

24:54.858 --> 24:58.462
¶ there'll be
no promotion ¶

24:58.529 --> 25:02.199
¶ this side of the ocean ¶

25:02.266 --> 25:06.236
¶ so cheer up, my lads ¶

25:06.304 --> 25:08.305
¶ bless them all ¶

All in the family
