There's this alliance

in the world.
-Wow.

28:43.895 --> 28:45.723
-And we need him for challenges,
obviously.
-Yeah.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.240
-But he came here.
-Yeah.

28:47.275 --> 28:49.481
-So, you know,
he might have an extra vote.
-Yeah, for sure.

28:49.517 --> 28:51.136
So I think, honestly,

28:51.172 --> 28:53.758
-I think it's p-probably
going that way.
-Probably gonna be Xander.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.172
Which, everyone is gonna be
like, "You dummies.

28:55.205 --> 28:57.067
-You need to win something."
-Right. "You need to win."

28:57.103 --> 29:00.481
EVVIE:
I want Deshawn to know that
I'm someone he can work with,

29:00.517 --> 29:02.931
and I want to try to give
him something to prove that.

29:02.964 --> 29:04.862
But I don't really
want to give anything away

29:04.895 --> 29:06.172
that matters too much to me.

29:06.205 --> 29:08.964
Ready for me to solidify
our alliance even more?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.792
Do you know anything about
how the idols work this season?

29:12.758 --> 29:13.931
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

29:13.964 --> 29:15.481
But I know how they work,
and it's crazy.

29:15.517 --> 29:16.654
-Okay. Tell me, please.
-Okay.

29:16.689 --> 29:18.240
Basically,
on each of our beaches...

29:18.275 --> 29:22.103
I'll reveal some things but
mostly other people's secrets.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.895
That's basically my strategy.

29:23.931 --> 29:25.136
So I think it's probably okay

29:25.172 --> 29:27.309
to reveal some
of Xander's secrets,

29:27.344 --> 29:29.136
'cause it probably
won't even matter tomorrow.

29:29.172 --> 29:30.448
I know who has it on mine.

29:30.481 --> 29:32.758
-Xander? Yeah, okay.
-Xander. That's the other reason

29:32.792 --> 29:34.448
why Xander's in trouble
on our tribe.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.067
-So be careful,
'cause it's a big risk.
-Yeah. No, I'm careful.

29:36.103 --> 29:38.000
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you for telling me that.

29:38.034 --> 29:40.792
-Yeah, no, I got. I got you.
-You're-you're all good? Okay.

29:42.758 --> 29:44.792
♪

29:50.000 --> 29:51.758
All right.

29:51.792 --> 29:54.517
"Risk your vote
or protect your vote."

29:56.309 --> 29:59.758
EVVIE: My vote tonight
is extremely essential.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.826
I've been gone from camp
all day,

30:01.862 --> 30:03.172
and I need my vote tonight.

30:03.205 --> 30:05.862
So I know, no matter what,
I'm gonna protect my vote.

30:05.895 --> 30:09.067
And I also hope
that by protecting my vote,

30:09.103 --> 30:11.172
I build some trust with Deshawn,

30:11.205 --> 30:13.172
so that he could risk
his safely.

30:13.205 --> 30:15.413
And I want to prove to him
that I do what I say,

30:15.448 --> 30:17.689
and hopefully we are going
to be an alliance

30:17.723 --> 30:19.654
moving forward in the game,

30:19.689 --> 30:20.758
and that we can use
that extra vote together.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.344
All right.

30:35.136 --> 30:37.723
[birds squawking]

30:50.448 --> 30:53.275
Yeah.

30:54.448 --> 30:56.862
-LIANA: Evvie!
-VOCE: What's up?

30:58.309 --> 31:00.792
...that thing is brutal.

31:00.826 --> 31:03.172
Okay, let me fill you in.

31:03.205 --> 31:04.378
And we did the decision thing.
It was...

31:04.413 --> 31:05.758
XANDER:
Is it still "risk your vote"?

31:05.792 --> 31:07.309
It was the exact same
that you said.

31:07.344 --> 31:09.826
I was pretty confident
that he was gonna risk his,

31:09.862 --> 31:12.723
so I protected mine.
So that's it.

31:12.758 --> 31:14.275
I need to fill up my water
bottle if anyone wants to come.

31:14.309 --> 31:15.758
-TIFFANY: I'm coming.
-Okay.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.826
Coming back into camp,

31:17.862 --> 31:20.240
I had no idea what to expect

31:20.275 --> 31:22.689
because being away
from everyone else at camp,

31:22.723 --> 31:24.344
you never know
what's going to happen.

31:24.378 --> 31:25.862
-TIFFANY: Voce is scrambling.
-EVVIE: Yup.

31:27.964 --> 31:29.000
EVVIE:
But whatever. It doesn't matter.

31:29.034 --> 31:30.103
-Right?
-But wait a minute.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.275
I know. I...

31:37.586 --> 31:40.067
I... That's what I think. Right?

31:42.378 --> 31:43.895
The only thing. We haven't...
We haven't won

31:43.931 --> 31:45.619
-a freaking challenge anyway.
-Okay. Good. I'm down.

31:45.654 --> 31:47.862
-Okay. And then we'll deal
with the fallout later. Okay.
-Yup.

31:47.895 --> 31:49.826
EVVIE:
Us three girls are secretly

31:49.862 --> 31:51.619
gonna blindside Xander.

31:51.654 --> 31:53.689
He's vulnerable.
We could get that idol out,

31:53.723 --> 31:55.275
we could get
that extra vote out

31:55.309 --> 31:57.862
and have three women
in charge of this game.

31:57.895 --> 31:59.413
And I just have to try
to make sure that the boys

31:59.448 --> 32:01.448
believe that I'm with them.

32:05.448 --> 32:06.758
VOCE:
Yeah.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.378
-We've got to win. Yeah.
-I know.

32:09.413 --> 32:11.103
So you guys are thinking Tiff?

32:12.550 --> 32:16.413
I'm fine with that.
So Tiff? Okay.

32:29.689 --> 32:31.034
And that protects me.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.517
Hold on. It's-it's
whether or not he has the idol.

32:33.550 --> 32:38.792
No, it's not. What keeps us here
today, tomorrow, no matter what?

32:38.826 --> 32:41.136
-Just... just...
-The only way to protect me.
Listen.

32:41.172 --> 32:43.136
If he has the idol,
the only way to protect me

32:43.172 --> 32:46.000
is to put Voce's name down.

32:46.034 --> 32:48.103
What does that tell you? I...
Listen, I know you want him out,

32:48.136 --> 32:49.103
-but it has to be Voce.
-I know.

32:49.136 --> 32:50.448
That's what I think.

32:50.481 --> 32:52.172
There's a lot of things
going on right now

32:52.205 --> 32:54.964
that I can't even
keep it all straight. Xander has

32:55.000 --> 32:58.067
some sort of idol that he has to
come together with other people,

32:58.103 --> 33:00.619
and I still am unclear if he has
one or doesn't have one.

33:00.654 --> 33:02.413
Listen, he's savvy.

33:02.448 --> 33:05.172
He might even be lying to Evvie,

33:05.205 --> 33:07.964
unless I'm being one of those
stupid Survivorplayers,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
which I really hope I'm not.

33:15.172 --> 33:17.931
EVVIE:
Okay. Okay.

33:17.964 --> 33:20.034
...butterflies in purple...

33:20.067 --> 33:21.586
I read the note, dude.
I read the note.

33:21.619 --> 33:23.034
It said that he had to say
"butterflies in purple"?

33:23.067 --> 33:24.550
Yes. Yes. I read the note.

33:29.689 --> 33:32.309
Because his idol doesn't work
yet, remember? His idol...

33:35.309 --> 33:37.309
-Remember?
-Okay, because here's the thing.

33:42.205 --> 33:43.862
EVVIE:
I don't think he has an idol.

33:43.895 --> 33:45.309
Just in case, even...
'Cause...

33:45.344 --> 33:47.586
EVVIE: Out of nowhere,
Tiff starts panicking.

33:47.619 --> 33:49.136
She got a vote last time.

33:49.172 --> 33:50.895
She knows
she might get a vote this time.

33:50.931 --> 33:54.309
But I know for a fact that
Xander really can't do anything,

33:54.344 --> 33:56.309
but Tiffany wants to vote Voce.

33:58.103 --> 33:59.550
Liana, are you okay with it?

33:59.586 --> 34:01.000
I know. I know you're not.

34:01.034 --> 34:02.378
-I know you're...
I know you're...
-No.

34:04.067 --> 34:06.758
EVVIE:
Now I'm having second thoughts
on who I really want

34:06.792 --> 34:09.034
to work with in this game,
and the thing is,

34:09.068 --> 34:11.275
Xander really, really,
really trusts me,

34:11.309 --> 34:12.862
and that's huge.

34:23.275 --> 34:26.103
Hmm. Yeah.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.206
-LIANA: No.
-EVVIE: On this group of five,

34:31.240 --> 34:34.931
I'm in the middle and will be
deciding who goes home tonight.

34:34.965 --> 34:37.275
This is the craziest day
of my life, like, for real.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.137
And no matter what happens,

34:39.172 --> 34:41.206
Tribal's going to be insane.

34:50.309 --> 34:52.275
[quietly]:
The players are about
to walk in.

34:52.309 --> 34:53.827
It could be a crazy Tribal.

34:53.862 --> 34:56.413
It's either tribe strength
or alliance loyalty,

34:56.447 --> 34:57.827
but somebody's going home.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.413
♪

35:07.068 --> 35:10.965
All right, so before
we get into it, I just want

35:11.000 --> 35:13.378
to commend you guys because
you're vulnerable out here,

35:13.413 --> 35:15.000
and you let us see you
at your best

35:15.034 --> 35:17.619
and sometimes
your not best moments,

35:17.655 --> 35:19.137
and that's what makes it
so compelling.

35:19.172 --> 35:20.724
Starting with you, Tiffany,
because you had

35:20.757 --> 35:22.000
a tough day in the challenge.

35:22.034 --> 35:23.724
-I did.
-What is it like

35:23.757 --> 35:25.550
just being vulnerable?

35:25.585 --> 35:27.447
TIFFANY:
I'm not good at that.
I like to do my best.

35:27.481 --> 35:30.931
I like to give 100%,
and I like to win.

35:30.965 --> 35:33.344
But out here,
I've learned that

35:33.378 --> 35:37.931
I can't be happy and social
and play this game on zero food

35:37.965 --> 35:40.034
and no sleep.
And when it comes

35:40.068 --> 35:42.206
to the challenge,
I think I can do it, but

35:42.240 --> 35:43.965
I, at one moment, thought,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.413
"I'm just gonna lay down

35:45.447 --> 35:47.378
and I just hope nobody sees me."

35:47.413 --> 35:50.447
And so, you want to give up,
but you can't.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.585
-PROBST: Really,
the lesson is...
-TIFFANY: Yeah.

35:52.619 --> 35:54.619
...Survivorwill humble you.

35:54.655 --> 35:56.793
Xander, you're a young guy,
you're physical,

35:56.827 --> 35:59.550
you should be athletic,
but I'm sure

35:59.585 --> 36:02.034
you've been humbled
out here already in five days.

36:02.068 --> 36:05.034
XANDER:
Yeah, this is all raw,
this is all

36:05.068 --> 36:07.413
real, and it's happening live,
you know?

36:07.447 --> 36:10.481
I'm not sitting at home on
the couch watching and thinking,

36:10.516 --> 36:12.344
"Oh, Xander's making
a great move."

36:12.378 --> 36:15.516
No, I'm here, and
I have no idea what I'm doing.

36:15.550 --> 36:18.068
Voce, how about for you?

36:18.103 --> 36:20.481
Yeah, part of this experience
has been super humbling

36:20.516 --> 36:22.137
because I'm used
to being in an environment

36:22.172 --> 36:23.585
where you have to succeed.

36:23.619 --> 36:26.275
In the operating room,
if you make a mistake

36:26.309 --> 36:29.068
where you cut an artery,
that is devastating.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.550
But one of the most
important things in surgery

36:31.585 --> 36:33.068
is that you review your error

36:33.103 --> 36:34.862
so that never happens again.

36:34.896 --> 36:37.240
And we're, right now,
a tribe that's on life support,

36:37.275 --> 36:40.481
and somehow we have got
to figure out where all

36:40.516 --> 36:42.793
the bleeding is coming from,
because it's not stopping.

36:42.827 --> 36:44.896
PROBST:
I have a question for you.

36:44.931 --> 36:46.619
When we were talking
about Shot in the Dark,

36:46.655 --> 36:48.172
and I said, "One in six,
roughly 17%,"

36:48.206 --> 36:51.103
-and you said, "16 point..."
-16.66667.

36:51.137 --> 36:53.655
PROBST:
Okay, did you know that already,

36:53.688 --> 36:55.103
or were you doing that
in your head?

36:55.137 --> 36:57.137
I knew the answers
to the fraction already.

36:57.172 --> 36:58.206
Where does that come from?

36:58.240 --> 36:59.965
As a kid, were you smart?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.103
-What was your story?
-I actually was not smart

37:02.137 --> 37:03.827
growing up as a kid.

37:03.862 --> 37:06.378
My mother instilled in me
this mantra of,

37:06.413 --> 37:08.068
"Whatever you do, work hard

37:08.103 --> 37:09.724
and work to the best
of your ability."

37:09.757 --> 37:12.000
She was a single mom
after my dad died.

37:12.034 --> 37:14.103
She was raising me
and my sister.

37:14.137 --> 37:16.896
She had to get up,
get us ready for school,

37:16.931 --> 37:19.378
go to work, provide for us
as best as she could,

37:19.413 --> 37:21.447
come home
and do it all over again.

37:21.481 --> 37:24.344
And so it's all credit
to my mom for giving me that,

37:24.378 --> 37:27.137
just that drive
where I want to succeed.

37:27.172 --> 37:29.619
PROBST:
So, Liana, how do you

37:29.655 --> 37:31.240
manage that
when you're at camp

37:31.275 --> 37:33.034
going, "Well, we lost,
and we lost.

37:33.068 --> 37:35.034
Therefore..." blank?

37:35.068 --> 37:36.862
Yeah, you know,
like Voce was saying, like,

37:36.896 --> 37:39.103
we're trying to find that
artery, where are we bleeding?

37:39.137 --> 37:41.931
And everyone's version of where
we're bleeding is different.

37:41.965 --> 37:44.481
That's what's so beautiful about
this game. We're a microcosm

37:44.516 --> 37:48.481
of the real world, and we all
think about things differently.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.103
But you just don't know
until you're up there voting

37:51.137 --> 37:53.378
-what's going to happen.
-PROBST: So, Tiffany,

37:53.413 --> 37:56.481
it would be very easy
for these four to say,

37:56.516 --> 37:58.862
"Love you,
but you killed us today."

37:58.896 --> 38:00.240
That had to go
through your head.

38:00.275 --> 38:01.481
This is not
some shocking revelation.

38:01.516 --> 38:03.585
Not at all. Not at all.
I absolutely

38:03.619 --> 38:05.447
expected my tribe to think that.

38:05.481 --> 38:08.034
But Survivoris not just
about challenges.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.585
It's a social game,
and I'm really

38:10.619 --> 38:12.240
banking on the fact tonight

38:12.275 --> 38:15.344
that I've created bonds
and spoken to people enough

38:15.378 --> 38:17.688
to know they're not going
to blame just me

38:17.724 --> 38:19.585
on this one vote.

38:19.619 --> 38:21.378
PROBST:
So, Evvie, Tiffany

38:21.413 --> 38:24.344
is pitching the alliance portion
of this.

38:24.378 --> 38:26.931
Give me the reason why
that makes sense in this game.

38:26.965 --> 38:29.068
EVVIE:
Obviously, we'd want
this remaining

38:29.103 --> 38:30.516
group of people
to win a challenge,

38:30.550 --> 38:32.240
but we don't even know
that we're gonna be

38:32.275 --> 38:35.000
in a challenge with this group
of people ever again.

38:35.034 --> 38:36.309
You know, we could very well
swap tomorrow,

38:36.344 --> 38:38.619
and then it would be
almost irrelevant

38:38.655 --> 38:40.965
what everyone's individual
challenge strengths are,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.275
and it would matter much more

38:42.309 --> 38:44.206
what everyone's
individual relationships are.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.378
On the other hand, if we do have
another challenge tomorrow,

38:47.413 --> 38:50.034
none of us want to go down
to three people and enter,

38:50.068 --> 38:52.034
you know, a merge
that far down in the numbers.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.585
So it's really a balancing act
between those two things.

38:54.619 --> 38:58.240
PROBST:
Xander, there's never a right
or wrong answer of,

38:58.275 --> 39:02.137
should you be tribe strength
for challenges, or

39:02.172 --> 39:04.585
loyalty strength for alliances?
It's just,

39:04.619 --> 39:07.172
where is it going to go based
on the group of people?

39:07.206 --> 39:09.309
XANDER:
I mean, you're totally right.

39:09.344 --> 39:10.827
It's juggling chain saws,

39:10.862 --> 39:13.481
whether you want to focus
on loyalty,

39:13.516 --> 39:17.757
or is it someone who can help
get you further? I mean,

39:17.793 --> 39:19.378
every person in this game

39:19.413 --> 39:21.965
should be trying
to just get to the next day.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.447
Because this game is
unpredictable,

39:23.481 --> 39:26.034
and that's what makes it
so beautiful is that

39:26.068 --> 39:27.240
you never know what's coming.

39:27.275 --> 39:28.965
Like, there could be no swap.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.378
This is truly
"drop the four, keep the one."

39:32.413 --> 39:34.688
We should start fresh
and just consider

39:34.724 --> 39:37.447
that, you know,
whatever gets us to the next day

39:37.481 --> 39:40.585
is something
that's good enough.

It's a big letdown

42:33.447 --> 42:35.034
to be out this early
in the game.

42:35.068 --> 42:38.757
I think I came into this game
with a mistrust of people,

42:38.793 --> 42:41.240
and I instantly put my trust
in a couple of people

42:41.275 --> 42:43.757
and didn't make sure
that my relationship-building

42:43.793 --> 42:45.793
was going well
with the entire tribe,

42:45.827 --> 42:48.172
and ultimately
that was my downfall.

42:48.206 --> 42:50.688
No regrets. This was
an adventure of a lifetime.
