WEBVTT

01:16.076 --> 01:16.910
Jin-myung.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.413
If you want to win back an ex-boyfriend...

01:24.125 --> 01:26.294
A way to win your ex-boyfriend back?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.797
Yes, there is definitely a way.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.715
Jump him.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.802
What's this punk whining about?

01:34.969 --> 01:37.847
Stop whining. Just leave tomorrow open.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.329
Ye-eun. I need to ask you something.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.039
Shoot.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.457
Quietly.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.000
What is it?

02:06.459 --> 02:07.919
What? Nothing.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.087
Ask me.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.589
Politics. Economics. Society. Culture.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.299
What do I lack that she has?

02:13.883 --> 02:14.801
It's nothing.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.387
There is one.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.722
Boy problems?

02:21.558 --> 02:25.103
"How do I win back my ex-boyfriend?"

02:25.186 --> 02:26.312
Right?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.106
How did you know?

02:28.189 --> 02:31.109
Given how you have been lately,
it's impossible not to know.

02:47.292 --> 02:53.006
EPISODE 6
I'M A MIRACLE #InSearchofLostTime

02:53.089 --> 02:57.010
How to win your ex-boyfriend back.

02:57.677 --> 02:58.803
Is there a way?

03:00.805 --> 03:04.350
You're the most popular with guys
among all of us.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.520
No, not really.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.355
Not as much as Yi-na, of course.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.774
Then go ask her.

03:12.025 --> 03:12.901
No.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.863
I feel like you might know more
about this than Yi-na does.

03:18.364 --> 03:22.035
-Really?
-She had a lot of boyfriends,

03:22.118 --> 03:24.537
but I doubt she ever stuck with one.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.747
And I have?

03:26.247 --> 03:29.417
No one compares to you when it comes to
getting back together with an ex.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.336
How many times was it?

03:33.338 --> 03:34.964
But you said you broke up with him.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.053
-Yeah.
-Why did you break up with him then?

03:42.722 --> 03:45.099
She expected him
to refuse to break up with her.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.810
"We should just break up then," means

03:47.894 --> 03:49.562
"Like me more."

03:50.563 --> 03:53.942
Why is it so complicated? It's as twisted
as an herbivore's intestines.

03:54.525 --> 03:58.404
How did you get your ex-boyfriends
to get back together with you?

04:02.116 --> 04:04.410
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

04:08.623 --> 04:13.753
I can't guarantee that what worked for me
will work for you as well.

04:15.630 --> 04:20.468
What's important is that it isn't any guy,
but an ex-boyfriend.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.886
Yes, that's right.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.389
Show him a side of you
that he didn't see before.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.892
Not something he's used to,
but something new.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.811
Like what?

04:30.311 --> 04:32.230
Something you don't have?

04:33.231 --> 04:35.149
What don't I have?

04:39.737 --> 04:41.406
Several things.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.370
-Being cutesy?
-Cutesy?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.414
You had no pet names for him, did you?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.294
You never did baby talk, did you?

04:56.838 --> 05:01.259
Even Jin-myung does baby talk
when talking to her boyfriend.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.385
"Even"?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.137
Jin-myung!

05:05.096 --> 05:06.764
You have a boyfriend?

05:07.932 --> 05:10.268
Is it that shocking
that I have a boyfriend?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.563
No, but it's kind of...

05:13.646 --> 05:14.981
I know how you feel.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.859
You don't have to say it.
We get you, so calm down.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.153
It's okay.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.322
She has a boyfriend.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.284
Baby talk. Being cutesy.
I'm terrible at those things.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.244
That's why you should practice.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.499
Okay, gather round.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.842
Okay. Let's all learn

05:42.925 --> 05:45.303
"Ye-eun Jung's First Steps
of Being Cutesy."

05:45.386 --> 05:46.929
The three-step process.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.683
A flower.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.020
Blink blink.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.026
You go.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.414
Can you be any stiffer?
Lightly, like this.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.301
What?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.428
Look.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.013
Not this,

06:31.432 --> 06:32.391
but this.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.520
Oh my gosh.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.915
Aren't you curious? I know you are.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.250
I am not.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.171
A surprising twist. A shocking truth.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.755
You find it yourself.

07:45.506 --> 07:49.177
Let's look for my lost memory together,
my friend.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.985
What is that crap?

08:06.527 --> 08:08.029
Sung-min.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.871
You'll go with me, right?

08:16.954 --> 08:19.040
Stop it.

08:21.542 --> 08:25.171
This is the schedule for events abroad
during the first half of the next year.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.715
I would like each department to be careful

08:28.007 --> 08:31.344
and not make the types of mistakes
like last time.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.180
Also,

08:35.223 --> 08:37.433
we have the voting results

08:37.642 --> 08:39.936
regarding the artist
with the highest loss.

08:41.103 --> 08:45.650
With the approval of 82%, it's been
decided that Asgard will be disbanded.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.570
As for the vote
on the continued investment

08:49.654 --> 08:54.575
on the individual members,
we'll keep Odin and Freyr on,

08:54.659 --> 08:58.079
but for the remaining five,
their contracts will be canceled.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.040
Management team.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.460
There is talk about the FTC
investigating companies

09:04.669 --> 09:06.754
for unfair contracts.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.717
Let's avoid any problems
and make it clean.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.052
Yes, sir.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.347
Now, please be careful
that word doesn't get out

09:16.430 --> 09:19.016
until the paperwork is completed.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.935
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.938
Poor kids.

09:24.689 --> 09:28.109
They probably thought they'd be
the next Big Bang or EXO.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.527
They were dreaming.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.029
Everyone has a dream when they come here.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.656
That's true, but...

09:34.282 --> 09:36.033
What will they do now?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.952
They sacrificed their youth.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.275
Look.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.027
This is my alma mater.

10:12.069 --> 10:12.903
Hey. Here.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.242
I had big dreams
while attending this small school.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.244
I, Ji-won Song.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.746
I said to take this.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.709
On the grounds that inherited

10:26.917 --> 10:29.170
The spirit of the mountains

10:29.253 --> 10:30.630
I said to take this.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.216
-The soldiers of tomorrow
-Hey. Take this.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.468
SMALL SCHOOL, BIG DREAMS

10:35.551 --> 10:37.928
-Grow up bravely
-Why you...

10:39.138 --> 10:40.097
Hey, you.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.976
Did you really run in this heat
to avoid carrying this?

10:44.101 --> 10:46.437
You're the doofus
who ran after me with it.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.438
Seriously.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.731
You made it!

10:49.231 --> 10:51.150
-This way.
-Sorry?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.904
This way. You're late.
Everyone else is here.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.865
What are you doing?

10:58.115 --> 10:59.158
Come on in.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.536
-Me too?
-Of course.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.498
Don't worry too much.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.835
You didn't have to bring that.
We can't accept gifts anymore.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.088
You know, the new anti-bribery law.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.757
Please come in. This way.

11:16.008 --> 11:16.884
Come in.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.849
This way. Here.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.311
Have a seat.

11:36.153 --> 11:40.282
Ma'am. We'll get started now.

11:42.493 --> 11:46.163
Let's have everyone
introduce themselves again.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.873
Sir, you first.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.714
I'm Dae-hyun Sung's father.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.636
I'm sorry to meet you
under these circumstances.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.645
I am...

12:10.813 --> 12:12.731
So-min Yoon's mom.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.401
I'm so...

12:17.361 --> 12:20.114
I'm sorry.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.158
I'm sorry.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.508
Well, I...

12:40.676 --> 12:42.386
I'm Ji-won Song.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.143
We're in the wrong room.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.030
It's your fault.
It's because you look old.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.573
Look at your hair before you talk.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.866
Ji-won Song?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.620
Are you really Ji-won Song?

13:09.413 --> 13:10.331
Yes.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.999
My gosh.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.626
Don't you recognize me?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.880
My fifth-grade homeroom teacher?

13:18.255 --> 13:19.089
No.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.967
That's right. Sixth grade.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.302
No.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.138
Then... Fourth grade...

13:26.222 --> 13:27.932
I was never your homeroom teacher.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.850
I was next door
when you were in third grade.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.101
You were in 3-2,

13:31.727 --> 13:32.853
I taught homeroom for 3-3.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.066
I see. Hello.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.901
Hi. It's been a while.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.695
What brings you to the school?

13:42.738 --> 13:45.157
I just wanted to look into something.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.118
Into what?
What would you look into at school?

13:48.869 --> 13:49.870
Is something wrong?

13:51.455 --> 13:54.041
No. It's nothing bad. I just...

13:55.626 --> 13:56.627
Who is this?

13:57.628 --> 13:58.837
Boyfriend?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.341
He's a boy and he is a friend.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.594
He's good looking.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.263
And normal.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.349
-Are you marrying him?
-What?

14:12.434 --> 14:16.522
No, we're not like that.
We haven't even graduated yet.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.606
Graduate?

14:18.607 --> 14:19.984
You're in school?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.194
You got into college?

14:22.319 --> 14:23.571
You?

14:23.779 --> 14:24.697
Ji-won Song?

14:25.364 --> 14:26.866
Oh my gosh.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.786
That's the biggest shock
after 30 years of teaching.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.163
What was she like?

14:33.539 --> 14:36.208
Don't even get me started.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.503
She'd suddenly scream
in the middle of class,

14:39.587 --> 14:42.006
say there's an alligator in the plant,

14:42.089 --> 14:45.759
say there's a large snake in the art room.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.095
-Me?
-Yes, you.

14:49.430 --> 14:53.017
You were so quiet and unnoticeable before,

14:53.601 --> 14:55.936
but you changed after the summer.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.523
You became so talkative,
and lied whenever you opened your mouth.

15:00.232 --> 15:04.612
-Was that during third grade?
-That's right. Third grade.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.989
Ms. Kang was so worried about you.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.994
But what did you say you are here for?

15:15.456 --> 15:19.627
I'm looking for a friend Hyo-jin Moon,
who had transferred out.

15:19.877 --> 15:23.797
She transferred out during third grade.
I wondered where she went.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.300
Hyo-jin Moon?

15:27.509 --> 15:28.719
Hyo-jin Moon?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.347
Come with me.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.147
How infamous were you
that the teacher next door remembers you?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.024
I talk a lot? Look who's talking.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.819
-Hyo-jin transferred during third grade?
-Yeah.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.030
That was also when my personality changed.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
Which means something happened that year.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.494
Let's go.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.828
Where?

15:55.412 --> 15:57.873
Sangduk Grade School,
where Hyo-jin transferred to.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.375
That's in Okcheon.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.585
It's not far from here.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.628
What...

16:05.005 --> 16:07.007
It's over 100km. It's 130km!

16:07.091 --> 16:09.718
In this global era,
100km is just one step.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.845
Take that step by bus.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.890
I'll be nice and drop you off
at the terminal for old time's sake.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.476
Sung-min.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.523
Stop it.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.026
I said to stop.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.740
Stop it! Stop.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.160
Why is that so hard?

16:40.708 --> 16:41.625
You're good.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.544
It's easy.

16:44.294 --> 16:47.172
I can even seduce the Buddha statue.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.425
Then why don't you get a boyfriend?

16:49.800 --> 16:52.386
Why should I? You're all I need.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.764
But I'm not enough for you.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.058
It's so unfair.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.813
I should've stopped you
from moving in because of that letter.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.108
You don't talk about it anymore.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.071
You said you would get revenge
for that person. What happened?

17:11.864 --> 17:12.740
I will.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.491
Yeah, right.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.535
You're becoming friends
with your housemates.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.162
I'm going to tell on you.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.499
Then... You'll be all mine again.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.711
No, that's right.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.254
You have a boyfriend.

17:29.506 --> 17:32.134
How many people must I eliminate
to claim you all for myself?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.053
Wait here.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.054
Why?

17:35.304 --> 17:38.015
I told you. I can't bring people over
anytime I want.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.601
I'll get my bag, so wait here.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.894
Here?

17:43.187 --> 17:44.229
It's hot.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.822
It's fine. Come in.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.701
Why did you make her wait in the heat?

17:58.202 --> 17:59.036
But...

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
Belle Epoque's rule...

18:01.580 --> 18:02.706
It's only for a minute.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.833
He says it's okay.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.295
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes, something cold.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.713
Okay.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.174
He's so nice.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.134
Naturally.
You're my girlfriend's best friend.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.224
Here.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.523
How long have you two been dating?

18:34.071 --> 18:36.115
What? Why are you looking at each other?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.284
-Two weeks...
-One week...

18:43.288 --> 18:44.623
The thing is,

18:44.915 --> 18:47.000
I liked her first.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.295
She didn't like me back,
so we started dating just a week ago.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.173
It hasn't been long, then.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.676
No. But it's the most passionate time.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.471
What did you like about Eun?

19:00.389 --> 19:03.308
-What?
-There are four other girls here.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.269
Why do you like Eun?

19:05.352 --> 19:07.521
-Hey. Come on.
-What?

19:11.191 --> 19:13.068
What do I like about my Eun?

19:16.405 --> 19:17.447
She's cute.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.453
You have a good eye.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.373
You noticed that my Eun is cute.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.376
-Where do you go on dates?
-What?

19:30.210 --> 19:31.211
Well, we...

19:31.295 --> 19:32.296
That's enough.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.964
Let's go. I'll see you off.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.051
Don't tell me...

19:38.677 --> 19:40.762
you hang out at home.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.014
What?

19:42.097 --> 19:44.766
Don't you dare, okay?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.937
-You had better not.
-Just come.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.734
At home?

19:58.739 --> 20:01.116
You said downstairs is empty.
He lives there alone.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.660
You can't be alone with him, okay?

20:04.870 --> 20:06.663
Answer me. Hurry.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.498
Okay.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.335
You don't know guys at all.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.046
And you do?

20:15.547 --> 20:16.381
Well I...

20:17.049 --> 20:18.550
Anyway.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.064
WELCOME

20:40.864 --> 20:46.662
A SCHOOL THAT GROWS WITH THE COMMUNITY

20:49.373 --> 20:51.875
It's your fault,
because you drove so slowly.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.212
Are you really giving me crap
for not speeding?

20:55.545 --> 20:57.631
Since when did you obey the law so well?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.467
It's four minutes past, and they're gone?

21:00.801 --> 21:02.844
-What now?
-Do you want to go and come back?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.683
Let's eat first. Let's go.

21:08.016 --> 21:08.850
Let's eat.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.396
Eat.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.653
Zero people?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.822
How many does that mean?

21:22.406 --> 21:23.740
One person or nine?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.201
It means they'll do as they please.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.668
What's wrong? Does your head hurt?

21:35.961 --> 21:36.962
No.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.050
Actually, Yoo-kyung...

21:42.259 --> 21:43.677
What the heck?

21:46.388 --> 21:47.597
Isn't that him?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.225
The one who wanted your number.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.228
Why? Did it not go well?

21:53.603 --> 21:55.063
Whatever. He is not my type.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.069
True. You like sexy guys.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.195
I do not.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.407
I need to eat quickly.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.456
-Oh no.
-Hurry. Hurry.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.457
I'm sorry!

22:14.499 --> 22:16.960
-Bye!
-Go in! Bye!

22:18.086 --> 22:19.880
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.382
I'm so tired.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.509
Good job.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.325
Hi, Mom.

22:48.825 --> 22:50.702
Where are you? Are you home?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.413
Of course, I'm home.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.248
-You are, right?
-Yes.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.585
Hello.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.170
Here.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.547
When did you get home?

23:03.131 --> 23:04.424
I got home a while ago.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.009
About...

23:06.635 --> 23:08.762
About 8 p.m.? Yes.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.138
Is everything okay?

23:10.347 --> 23:11.681
Yes, everything is fine.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.726
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.647
-Good night.
-You too.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.872
Sweetie, am I the cutest?

23:46.967 --> 23:49.219
Sweetie, am I the cutest?

23:49.845 --> 23:50.720
What?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.182
You approach dating like a class.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.067
Deal with it.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.946
I can't. I can't handle it anymore.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.701
Shoot. Look how many mosquito bites I got.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.370
How many is it? Dang it.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.330
I didn't get bit much.

24:17.747 --> 24:18.999
Was it just me?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.168
Those mosquito bastards.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.129
They got in because
you opened the window earlier.

24:24.212 --> 24:26.631
Just sleep.
How much blood could they suck?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.969
Let's go to a motel. I want to wash up.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.305
No. I don't have money.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.348
I have 50,000 won.

24:35.932 --> 24:36.892
Still. No.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.022
I won't jump you. I swear.

24:44.024 --> 24:47.402
You won't spread rumors
about going to a motel with me, will you?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.196
Never.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.369
Enjoy yourselves.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.537
We plan to.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.081
-Plan to what?
-That way.

25:18.558 --> 25:19.601
Want to wash up first?

25:20.852 --> 25:22.062
Will you say that again?

25:22.646 --> 25:23.647
What?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.607
"Do you want to wash up first?"

25:25.815 --> 25:26.900
"Should I wash first?"

25:28.360 --> 25:30.278
How long have I waited
to hear those words?

25:31.446 --> 25:35.533
But hearing them from you, I feel nothing.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.627
Okay. Let's think about everything
we have learned so far.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.923
Hyo-jin transferred before summer vacation
during third grade.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.716
I still don't know

25:51.800 --> 25:54.678
if the strange rumors
with the art teacher was the reason.

25:55.929 --> 26:00.350
Regardless, Okcheon was
where her mother's family lived.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.436
-Why are you lying down there?
-What?

26:06.481 --> 26:07.440
Sleep on the floor.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.650
Me?

26:09.359 --> 26:10.610
I drove.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.696
I can't do that.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.740
My body is like that of royalty.
I can't sleep on the floor.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.575
Whose fault is it that I'm even here?

26:18.910 --> 26:20.453
-Let's shoot for it.
-Forget it.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.372
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.959
No. I won't go.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.337
-Get down. Go.
-Hey.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.423
Let's sleep together. That will solve it.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.967
The bed is nice and big, don't you think?

26:35.135 --> 26:38.054
It's been a while
since I laid down with you.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.018
Fine. Why not?

26:53.486 --> 26:54.404
Sometimes,

26:56.031 --> 26:58.199
you cross the line.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.963
This is nice. Sleep down there.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.131
My back.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.759
You mean jerk.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.719
You virgin...

28:23.159 --> 28:24.661
What are you doing at this hour?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.997
I'm glad you're here.
Come scratch my back.

28:28.581 --> 28:30.750
-No.
-Come on. Scratch my back.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.920
-Stop being so gross.
-Why do you always say I'm gross?

28:34.003 --> 28:35.171
Gosh.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.923
Punk.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.553
What are you doing tomorrow?

28:42.345 --> 28:43.930
-Why?
-It's just...

28:44.431 --> 28:45.974
Ye-ji wants to meet.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.393
She does? Why?

28:49.644 --> 28:51.563
She wants to get to know you more.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.690
I can't. I'm busy.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.943
Busy with what? You're always napping.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.280
What? How did you know that I nap?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.074
Have you been watching me?

29:03.908 --> 29:04.743
Whatever.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.163
Okay. Now come here and scratch my back.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.622
Darn it.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.258
-Just above the shoulder blade.
- Here?

29:20.341 --> 29:21.760
Yeah, that's it. Higher.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.511
-Yeah. No.
-Happy?

29:25.722 --> 29:27.182
Is she kidding me or what?

29:38.109 --> 29:38.943
Wait here!

29:47.535 --> 29:50.288
Hello. Hi.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.501
I wanted to ask you something.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.045
No.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.255
Why not?

29:59.422 --> 30:00.965
According to privacy laws,

30:01.049 --> 30:03.551
I cannot give you
a student's contact information.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.928
She's my friend.

30:05.011 --> 30:08.348
Even if you were family,
I cannot without her consent.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.684
The previous school
gave me the information.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.064
Which school? What was the person's name?

30:16.648 --> 30:19.692
I know. Privacy laws. I know.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.195
I'm not some weirdo.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.614
Here's my ID card.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.492
As you can see,
I attend a top university...

30:27.617 --> 30:29.202
Come back with her consent.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.790
If I could get her consent,
why would I be here? Are you stupid?

30:40.046 --> 30:43.341
I was very close to Hyo-jin.
We have a picture together too.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.636
I just want to see her.
Don't you have friends?

30:46.719 --> 30:48.096
You must have a friend you miss.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.098
-I do not.
-Were you an outcast then?

30:55.979 --> 30:56.813
Ma'am?

30:58.439 --> 30:59.274
No.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.442
Ma'am.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.603
I miss you, my friend.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.564
Where are you, my friend?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.151
I miss you so much.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.280
I miss you.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.605
That's how you dress for a date?

32:22.398 --> 32:23.358
Look who's talking.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.041
What?

32:40.833 --> 32:43.211
Hi. Are you ready?

32:45.463 --> 32:46.339
I'm glad.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.424
About what?

32:48.591 --> 32:53.096
If you got dolled up for your date,
I was going to kill you.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.307
Wow. How scary.

32:57.892 --> 33:00.103
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

33:00.311 --> 33:02.897
You'll see. Did you bring your clothes?

33:18.454 --> 33:19.539
What?

33:21.165 --> 33:22.709
Why are you yelling at my Eun?

33:25.294 --> 33:26.129
Let's go.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.638
Get over here.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.558
Hey.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.564
Hey! Stop it!

34:19.223 --> 34:20.391
Okay, truce.

34:21.934 --> 34:22.852
Fine.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.776
I heard you're going to the army. When?

34:31.152 --> 34:32.528
In October.

34:33.529 --> 34:34.781
It's coming up.

34:35.823 --> 34:36.908
What about it?

34:37.492 --> 34:38.659
I'll tell her to dump you.

34:39.410 --> 34:40.286
Why you...

34:42.205 --> 34:43.164
Fine.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.751
Did Eun tell you about her dad?

34:48.711 --> 34:52.799
I guess she didn't.
Then, you aren't that close yet.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.176
I know everything.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.388
You don't know that, do you?

35:01.099 --> 35:05.269
Girls want to show their guys
only good things.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.688
Have you never dated, kid?

35:12.401 --> 35:14.821
That's cheating. Stop it!

35:15.071 --> 35:16.114
Come here!

35:16.489 --> 35:18.866
-Get over here.
-No!

35:25.957 --> 35:28.084
Let's move on to the chapter ten.

35:28.876 --> 35:32.296
We'll look at Julie,
who was abused as a child

35:32.380 --> 35:34.423
sexually and psychologically.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.927
Her memories from when she was six
still haunt her,

35:38.094 --> 35:40.179
making it difficult to lead a normal life,

35:40.263 --> 35:42.306
and she avoided personal relationships
as a result.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.143
She thus goes to see a psychiatrist.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.166
Have a nice day.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.834
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.435
-Hey.
-Yes?

36:29.395 --> 36:30.438
Here.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.989
It looks serious. You should see a doctor.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.036
Okay.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.756
-Let's go home.
-Okay.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.222
-I'm leaving first.
-Have a nice day.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.684
I need to go home too.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.937
Your boyfriend came with you, right?

37:11.520 --> 37:12.438
Please go.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.482
NO VEHICLES ALLOWED IN THE SCHOOL

37:37.880 --> 37:40.591
My granddaughter's name
is Suh-ah Cho-choi.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.677
My daughter-in-law's last name is Choi.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.889
It was their choice,
so I was fine with it,

37:47.431 --> 37:49.809
but what happens
if the mom has a two-part last name?

37:50.601 --> 37:54.146
What if my daughter-in-law's last name
was Sunwoo?

37:54.563 --> 37:56.941
Suh-ah Cho-Sunwoo? It's weird.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.611
Hyo-jin Moon-Namgoong. That's weird.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.907
Hyo-jin's mom's last name was Namgoong?

38:04.991 --> 38:06.993
I don't know about that.

38:07.410 --> 38:11.163
I think there is a Namgoong
in our town, too.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.041
Thank you.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.878
For what? I didn't say anything.

38:19.046 --> 38:19.964
Exactly.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.471
Come on. This way.

38:34.603 --> 38:35.855
Hey! Sung-min!

38:39.692 --> 38:43.279
-Did you see my Ronaldo kick?
-Whatever. I have to find a "Namgoong."

38:43.404 --> 38:45.323
That's Hyo-jin's mom's last name.

38:45.406 --> 38:46.699
Namgoong.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.452
How do I find a Namgoong?
Do I go to the town hall?

38:49.660 --> 38:52.663
-He's a Namgoong. Chul Namgoong.
-Okay. Go play.

38:52.747 --> 38:56.584
It'll be quicker to meet the town chief,
or parents' association president.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.961
Do you kids know the chief of the town?

38:59.045 --> 39:00.129
-No.
-No.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.922
Useless kids.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.632
He's a Namgoong too, right?

39:03.716 --> 39:06.135
Let's just go. We will go

39:06.385 --> 39:08.471
and ask anyone we see
if they know any Namgoongs.

39:08.637 --> 39:10.306
At least she wasn't a Kim.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.516
He's Chul Namgoong.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.395
Okay, I get it. So what?
If he's Chul Namgoong...

39:18.022 --> 39:19.774
I would be ever grateful.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.111
You're Chul Namgoong?

39:25.446 --> 39:29.492
-Then your dad is also a Namgoong?
-Yes. My grandpa, too.

39:29.575 --> 39:32.119
Of course, he should be.
It would be terrible otherwise.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.664
Where do you live? Let's go there.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.333
We'll drive you, okay?

39:38.793 --> 39:40.544
-Why not?
-Our teacher said

39:40.628 --> 39:42.755
not to get into a stranger's car.

39:42.838 --> 39:45.674
-Right. You shouldn't go with strangers.
-They'll kidnap you.

39:46.258 --> 39:47.676
Wretched safety training.

39:48.844 --> 39:49.762
Do something.

40:18.999 --> 40:19.875
That must be it.

40:23.587 --> 40:24.713
Who's there?

40:33.180 --> 40:35.474
-Hello.
-Who are you?

40:36.267 --> 40:39.770
My name is Ji-won Song. I'm a journalist.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.021
Well, that is,

40:41.647 --> 40:43.691
for our college paper.

40:46.235 --> 40:49.071
You're a reporter? With whom?

40:49.321 --> 40:52.199
Well, I'm not a real reporter.
I'm a student journalist.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.785
Are you a reporter or not?

40:57.705 --> 40:59.957
So? What about it?

41:00.875 --> 41:02.334
Do you know Hyo-jin Moon?

41:05.504 --> 41:08.841
Well, I heard her mom's last name
was Namgoong.

41:08.966 --> 41:10.801
I thought maybe you knew her.

41:12.052 --> 41:15.264
Since he's Chul Namgoong,
I thought maybe...

41:16.932 --> 41:18.267
Crap.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.438
So? What happened to Hyo-jin?

41:23.022 --> 41:24.398
Did she get herself in trouble?

41:25.858 --> 41:28.861
We have nothing to do with it.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.197
Even your own child is like a stranger
when they grow up.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.990
She's just a niece.

41:33.574 --> 41:38.245
And what does her running away
during junior high have to do with us?

41:38.579 --> 41:41.499
-She ran away? Why?
-How should I know?

41:42.208 --> 41:47.087
After her mom died, she pouted
like a duck for a while, then left.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.131
Her mom died? Why?

41:49.215 --> 41:52.176
She died because she didn't want to live.

41:54.929 --> 41:59.099
Whatever happened to Hyo-jin,
it has nothing to do with me,

41:59.642 --> 42:00.726
so just go.

42:00.809 --> 42:04.188
I'm not saying we're going to do anything.

42:04.563 --> 42:05.773
Just give me her address.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.817
She ran away during junior high.
How would I know her address?

42:08.984 --> 42:11.487
Did you hear me or not?

42:12.571 --> 42:15.824
Get inside. Go in and stuff your face.

42:15.908 --> 42:16.742
Damn it.

42:47.648 --> 42:49.525
Everyone has a dream when they come here.

42:49.775 --> 42:51.068
That's true, but...

42:52.152 --> 42:53.862
What will they do now?

42:54.113 --> 42:55.573
They sacrificed their youth.

42:56.365 --> 42:57.700
They should've quit sooner.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.160
They probably thought
they would make it someday.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.621
If they passed our auditions,

43:02.705 --> 43:05.040
they were probably local stars
back at home.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.667
They have the talent,

43:07.710 --> 43:08.836
but not enough.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.089
But that kind of talent is a curse.

43:12.172 --> 43:16.510
But at times, even those without talent
suddenly make it big.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.555
Maybe one in a thousand?
Yes, that happens to some,

43:20.222 --> 43:23.058
but you can't plan your life
banking on a miracle like that.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.160
Heimdallr!

43:42.286 --> 43:43.245
Coming.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.086
You just had a call.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.047
I left you a note.

43:54.673 --> 43:56.800
What's "Number One Girl"?

43:58.093 --> 43:59.261
-Good night.
-Night.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.189
Number One Girl. Roof at 7:00 p.m.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.631
-What is it?
-What do you mean?

44:35.923 --> 44:38.926
A celebrity is meeting his fan,
so it's like a fan meeting.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.307
Are you stressed about something?

44:46.475 --> 44:49.561
-What?
-But then again, nothing's easy.

44:49.645 --> 44:52.356
Trying to survive is tiring, am I right?

44:53.565 --> 44:57.361
Still, a new employee
shouldn't look so dejected.

44:57.486 --> 44:58.987
What if the CEO sees you like that?

45:01.407 --> 45:03.409
Whatever it is, chin up.

45:03.742 --> 45:06.495
I have had a lot of hardships
over the past nine years.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.081
It's so degrading and annoying.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.250
So I used to come here and...

45:15.754 --> 45:17.131
Sit down. Sit.

45:19.675 --> 45:22.803
It's cooler when you do this
on the 32nd floor roof,

45:23.429 --> 45:24.638
but it was locked.

45:30.727 --> 45:31.645
Okay. Get up.

45:39.903 --> 45:42.531
I'm telling you this
only because you're my number one fan.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.743
When I messed up
during our first performance,

45:47.619 --> 45:50.747
I was so upset
that I considered killing myself.

45:53.333 --> 45:55.294
It's okay. It was very brief.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.631
But even if I died,

45:59.923 --> 46:01.800
I wouldn't make it
on the entertainment news.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.552
So I didn't die.

46:03.844 --> 46:06.138
It would be senseless
if I died and no one knew.

46:10.225 --> 46:13.812
When I succeed later,
I'm going to tell this story on TV.

46:14.354 --> 46:15.439
I'll talk about you too.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.109
Do you really think you'll succeed?

46:19.193 --> 46:21.153
There you go. There you go again.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.864
Why are you so pessimistic?
What kind of a fan are you?

46:26.909 --> 46:29.578
Don't you worry. I will succeed for sure.

46:30.704 --> 46:33.499
I haven't succeeded yet
because I haven't worked hard enough.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.175
Wow.

46:49.806 --> 46:50.974
Wasn't that line cool?

46:51.308 --> 46:54.269
"I haven't succeeded yet
because I haven't worked hard enough."

46:55.020 --> 46:56.063
Wow, this line...

46:56.813 --> 46:58.899
I'm going to use this
during an interview later.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.735
This is my book of quotes.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.489
Look. "A person is nothing
without a dream."

47:06.073 --> 47:08.325
"A person who dreams does not age."

47:08.408 --> 47:10.911
"If you try hard, life won't betray you."

47:18.502 --> 47:21.046
Okay. I should get going.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.096
Hey.

47:36.436 --> 47:37.688
Eat this and cheer up.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.076
Chin up, my number one fan!

47:53.745 --> 47:54.580
Later.

48:16.768 --> 48:19.896
Don't take so much.
You'll bankrupt the place.

48:23.483 --> 48:25.277
I won't take everything.

48:25.861 --> 48:28.947
Eun likes this, so we need a lot.

48:32.075 --> 48:33.785
You sure brought a lot.

48:34.411 --> 48:35.579
She says she'll eat it all.

48:36.246 --> 48:37.289
Be careful.

48:37.831 --> 48:40.917
Let's put all of them. And then this.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.301
That was good.

48:50.510 --> 48:52.137
Thank you.

48:54.473 --> 48:55.807
Let's go to the bathroom.

49:01.688 --> 49:02.898
What funny girls.

49:04.316 --> 49:05.150
Funny.

49:11.031 --> 49:12.199
Take her home safely.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.118
Even if I don't want to, we live together.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.373
Get home safely. I'll call you.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.919
-Bye.
-Go already. Go.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.390
This isn't what you promised.

49:37.599 --> 49:39.226
-What?
-The check.

49:40.936 --> 49:42.646
You are such a pain.

49:43.605 --> 49:44.815
How much was it?

49:44.898 --> 49:46.191
It was 42,500 won.

49:51.321 --> 49:54.324
Fine. You have such a temper.

49:54.908 --> 49:58.161
Buy dinner sometime. For 32,500 won,
after netting out my portion.

49:58.662 --> 49:59.871
It doesn't have to be at once.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.207
You are so cheap.

50:07.003 --> 50:09.089
Ye-ji's really cute, isn't she?

50:12.676 --> 50:15.887
You regret not taking my offer
to set you two up, right?

50:20.517 --> 50:21.727
Poor you.

50:21.810 --> 50:23.228
Things got complicated,

50:23.311 --> 50:25.856
and now that possibility
is out the window.

50:26.481 --> 50:27.774
See? Why did you do that?

50:31.945 --> 50:33.196
You're cute, too.

50:52.632 --> 50:53.633
Are you mad?

50:54.676 --> 50:55.510
No.

50:57.304 --> 50:58.764
You look mad.

51:03.977 --> 51:05.687
-Sit down.
-No.

51:05.771 --> 51:08.148
I said to sit. Sit.

51:08.231 --> 51:09.149
I'm fine.

51:14.488 --> 51:15.572
Seriously.

52:06.873 --> 52:08.041
Ye-eun!

52:10.502 --> 52:13.588
I'm sorry. Did you wait long?
It took a while to clean up.

52:14.089 --> 52:15.257
It's okay. Let's go.

52:15.340 --> 52:16.716
He's there again.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.472
Yes, from before.

52:23.056 --> 52:24.266
What's wrong with him?

52:24.474 --> 52:25.976
-I'll talk to him.
-Wait.

52:26.852 --> 52:27.894
Wait a minute.

52:53.378 --> 52:56.256
Why are you staring at me like that?

52:56.923 --> 52:57.757
What?

52:59.509 --> 53:00.343
I wasn't.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.304
Yes, you were.

53:06.933 --> 53:08.852
Do you have something to say to me?

53:14.900 --> 53:18.028
I'm sorry if I sounded mean last time,

53:18.820 --> 53:23.033
but you shouldn't give me
strange looks like that.

53:29.456 --> 53:31.499
Wait. Just a minute.

53:41.051 --> 53:41.885
Be careful.

53:43.803 --> 53:44.971
So...

53:48.016 --> 53:49.059
Be careful at night.

53:50.685 --> 53:52.103
Don't go anywhere deserted.

53:54.022 --> 53:54.981
Don't go anywhere alone.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.415
Nice, Ye-eun.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.251
She's completely cured.

54:16.294 --> 54:17.128
You're right.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.631
Are you okay?

54:23.802 --> 54:24.719
Yes.

54:26.137 --> 54:27.681
My heart is racing,

54:29.516 --> 54:30.475
but I'm okay.

54:35.438 --> 54:36.564
Thank goodness.

54:37.315 --> 54:40.193
I was kind of reaching my limit
being your guardian.

54:40.276 --> 54:42.404
Like you did anything.

54:42.988 --> 54:44.239
Yoo-kyung did it all.

54:44.948 --> 54:47.409
-That's true.
-Still, be careful.

54:47.659 --> 54:50.829
You were getting better,
but got worse last time, too.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.209
Hey.

54:58.336 --> 54:59.713
What happened to your hair?

55:01.089 --> 55:02.298
This is nothing.

55:02.966 --> 55:04.843
It doesn't look like nothing.

55:05.427 --> 55:08.847
-Let me see.
-It's nothing. It really is.

55:11.725 --> 55:14.227
-Did you see her hair?
-You notice that now?

55:14.686 --> 55:16.563
She got that bald spot over a month ago.

55:16.646 --> 55:17.564
Really?

55:19.566 --> 55:22.736
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you go see a doctor?

55:23.653 --> 55:24.988
It's obviously from stress.

55:26.698 --> 55:27.699
Oh, no.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.659
Did you take medicine for it?

55:30.201 --> 55:31.036
Yeah.

55:32.954 --> 55:34.914
What's good for bald spots?

55:35.915 --> 55:37.208
It's okay.

55:57.353 --> 55:58.188
Are you sleeping?

55:59.773 --> 56:00.607
No.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.360
Ramble on about something. I'm bored.

56:07.739 --> 56:09.616
I guess there is no way to find her.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.870
Not unless you hire
a private investigator.

56:16.831 --> 56:21.127
Will this be the end
of the pretty shoes mystery?

56:22.754 --> 56:23.797
Pretty shoes.

56:25.215 --> 56:27.008
Maybe the shoes were just pretty.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.260
Right?

56:30.470 --> 56:34.140
That memory of her saying, "pretty shoes"
may have been distorted too.

56:36.184 --> 56:37.393
Perhaps.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.941
If you had to remember it,
I'm sure you would.

56:43.733 --> 56:44.692
Forget it.

56:46.778 --> 56:47.612
Forget.

56:47.987 --> 56:49.280
Red sun.

57:07.215 --> 57:09.300
-Are you cold?
-Yeah.

57:25.984 --> 57:27.569
The truth is, I was scared.

57:31.614 --> 57:33.199
The two children are alike.

57:34.409 --> 57:37.620
They look alike, are of similar height,

57:38.204 --> 57:39.706
dressed alike,

57:40.540 --> 57:43.877
and even have similar smiles.

57:48.965 --> 57:50.717
-Let's go, girls.
-Let's go.

57:52.177 --> 57:55.805
One of them experienced something
she never should have.

57:56.556 --> 57:57.932
Rumors got out about it,

57:58.433 --> 57:59.893
and she was practically chased out.

58:01.019 --> 58:02.770
That probably was the trigger,

58:02.979 --> 58:04.981
and she lost her mom and became an orphan.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.316
Pretty shoes.

58:06.816 --> 58:09.694
She lived with relatives
and was mistreated.

58:10.195 --> 58:13.198
She ran away from home,
and was never heard from again.

58:14.741 --> 58:15.992
I bet that child

58:16.826 --> 58:19.370
still has a hard life.

58:20.955 --> 58:22.373
And the other child

58:22.999 --> 58:25.793
graduated from grade school, junior high,

58:26.586 --> 58:29.214
and high school,
and became a college student.

58:30.715 --> 58:35.094
That child will live an average,
easy life.

58:36.971 --> 58:38.348
The two similar children.

58:38.973 --> 58:41.267
The same time, different lives.

58:42.143 --> 58:43.561
What's the difference?

58:44.479 --> 58:48.358
What reason made their fates split up?

58:50.318 --> 58:52.529
I do not know what that reason may be,

58:53.321 --> 58:55.657
but I felt like it was something petty.

58:56.658 --> 58:59.244
Something very minor.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.997
The thought that because
of a very minor, unnoticeable reason,

59:03.957 --> 59:07.961
my life could have been
completely different from what it was

59:09.003 --> 59:10.046
scared me.

59:11.881 --> 59:14.467
And I'm relieved.

59:16.553 --> 59:17.929
It's a relief

59:18.763 --> 59:20.890
that the minor reason wasn't mine.

59:23.434 --> 59:25.144
I was relieved,

59:25.687 --> 59:27.021
and I felt bad

59:27.814 --> 59:29.023
for the other child.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.416
Hi.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.043
Hello.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.211
Isn't it a great day?

59:51.212 --> 59:52.046
Yes.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.265
Come out!

1:00:03.349 --> 1:00:04.726
Where did you go?

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:09.105
-The supermarket.
-The supermarket?

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:10.982
Alone?

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:12.984
Really? Alone?

1:00:13.359 --> 1:00:16.696
I'm going to do things alone now.
It wasn't so bad once I tried.

1:00:17.530 --> 1:00:19.115
I'll cook something delicious today.

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:22.619
It's been a pain because of me, hasn't it?

1:00:23.870 --> 1:00:26.372
Madame Jung! That's so great!

1:00:26.956 --> 1:00:29.083
The hard times are over.

1:00:31.794 --> 1:00:34.088
-Let's have a party. A party.
-Okay.

1:00:34.505 --> 1:00:37.550
-You need help?
-No. Just sit back and enjoy today.

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:39.302
I'll do everything.

1:00:40.345 --> 1:00:41.346
It's cold.

1:00:42.930 --> 1:00:45.892
We'll have pizza and pasta today.

1:00:46.476 --> 1:00:47.685
Sounds great.

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:53.483
Creamy or tomato sauce?

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:56.486
-Tomato sauce. That's better, right?
-Yes.

1:00:58.863 --> 1:01:01.407
-She doesn't need therapy anymore?
-I think not.

1:01:02.742 --> 1:01:03.576
That's great.

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:22.845
Madame Jung. What is it?

1:01:34.857 --> 1:01:35.858
Madame Jung.

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:24.866
Have you heard any about Doo-young?

1:02:24.949 --> 1:02:26.159
Doo-young still lives here.

1:02:26.242 --> 1:02:28.703
In 2015, someone was electrocuted
in the lab.

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:31.122
Some say it was done by Ho-chang Kwon.

1:02:31.205 --> 1:02:34.959
You are now free to sign
with other agencies.

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:36.043
Like who?

1:02:36.127 --> 1:02:38.379
Will you be okay? They must be very upset.

1:02:38.463 --> 1:02:39.714
Let's talk.

1:02:39.797 --> 1:02:43.760
It's a skill to know
what you can and cannot do.

1:02:43.843 --> 1:02:45.678
Will you be happy if you get him
to date you?

1:02:45.762 --> 1:02:48.181
You weren't being yourself.

1:02:48.264 --> 1:02:49.849
-Will you date her?
-Do you want me to?

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:54.353
I thought I could control
liking or disliking someone.

1:02:54.437 --> 1:02:59.984
-What did she do? What was it, that...
-Someone hates me.

1:03:00.067 --> 1:03:00.902
Eun-jae!

1:03:05.907 --> 1:03:07.366
-Sung-shin Kim.
-Yes.

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:11.621
Someone in our class is receiving
an achievement award.

1:03:11.704 --> 1:03:13.372
-Jin-myung Yoon.
-Yes.

1:03:14.582 --> 1:03:19.837
She's cheerful and bubbly
with great social skills.

1:03:22.548 --> 1:03:24.926
-Eat this.
-Thanks.

1:03:25.009 --> 1:03:27.428
You're really cute.

1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:28.596
Really?

1:03:29.847 --> 1:03:31.849
-Hey, Eun.
-What?

1:03:31.933 --> 1:03:33.518
Want to come over tomorrow?

1:03:34.101 --> 1:03:36.562
-It's my birthday.
-Who else is going?

1:03:37.605 --> 1:03:38.689
Did you ask Seung-yeon?

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:41.025
I will.

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:43.569
Shy and quiet, few friends.

1:03:43.653 --> 1:03:45.446
She is shy because she takes after you.

1:03:52.119 --> 1:03:53.120
Ji-won.

1:03:53.871 --> 1:03:55.289
Want to take a speech class?

1:03:58.793 --> 1:04:00.628
Okay, you don't have to. Don't cry.

1:04:00.711 --> 1:04:03.631
-Why are you crying?
-What's wrong with her?

1:04:04.799 --> 1:04:05.675
EVALUATION

1:04:05.842 --> 1:04:07.051
Won the Spelling Bee.

1:04:08.719 --> 1:04:11.389
Overweight. Needs family guidance.

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:14.475
Seriously.

1:04:17.812 --> 1:04:18.813
Ye-eun!

1:04:19.397 --> 1:04:20.565
Stop eating!

1:04:20.648 --> 1:04:23.192
You can't keep eating sweets
just because they taste good!

1:04:26.946 --> 1:04:28.573
Unmotivated, can't relate to others.

1:04:31.576 --> 1:04:32.535
Eun-jae Yoo.

1:04:34.287 --> 1:04:35.288
Eun-jae Yoo!

1:04:41.919 --> 1:04:44.505
