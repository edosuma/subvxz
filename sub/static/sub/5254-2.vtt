- Previously on "Faking It"... 
- Both: [Bleep].

00:03.425 --> 00:05.126
From now on, I'll just
stay out of your life.

00:05.194 --> 00:06.427
Maybe that's for the best.

00:06.495 --> 00:08.061
What it would do to Karma if she found out

00:08.129 --> 00:09.330
that her soul mate slept with you?

00:09.398 --> 00:10.865
I was born intersex.

00:10.932 --> 00:12.700
The pills I take are hormone replacements.

00:12.768 --> 00:14.168
I'm worried you're pulling away.

00:14.236 --> 00:15.269
I could never hate you.

00:15.337 --> 00:16.937
I could never hate you, either.

00:20.743 --> 00:22.510
♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪

00:22.578 --> 00:25.079
♪ scraped my knees, whatever ♪

00:25.446 --> 00:26.580
Karma.

00:28.483 --> 00:29.583
Hi...

00:29.651 --> 00:31.485
Hey...

00:31.553 --> 00:33.453
I thought you might want
your work shirt back.

00:33.521 --> 00:34.521
I washed it.

00:34.589 --> 00:36.022
And ironed it.

00:36.090 --> 00:37.658
If it smells like weed, it's because it's been

00:37.725 --> 00:39.059
within ten feet of my parents.

00:48.969 --> 00:51.004
Thanks.

00:51.072 --> 00:52.538
So what are you working on?

00:52.606 --> 00:54.574
Oh, uh... oh, it's nothin'.

00:54.641 --> 00:55.675
Mr. Humble.

00:55.743 --> 00:58.544
I'm sure it's brilliant.

00:58.612 --> 01:01.747
Wow, a heart.

01:01.815 --> 01:02.815
Karma...

01:02.882 --> 01:05.184
- You really nailed it.
- Karma...

01:05.251 --> 01:06.285
I should go.

01:06.353 --> 01:07.653
I have trig with Mr. Hanley,

01:07.721 --> 01:09.422
and if I'm late, I'm
gonna have to sit up front

01:09.489 --> 01:11.790
and get a spittle shower.

01:22.168 --> 01:24.469
You and Karma are having a girls' weekend?

01:24.537 --> 01:25.971
Sure that's a good idea?

01:26.039 --> 01:27.239
Why wouldn't it be?

01:27.376 --> 01:29.044
Oh, I don't know, maybe because last week

01:29.112 --> 01:30.445
you told her you were in love with her?

01:30.513 --> 01:32.180
She doesn't feel the same way,

01:32.247 --> 01:34.382
and that's okay, but
I'm so glad I told her.

01:34.450 --> 01:35.750
I'm living my truth.

01:35.818 --> 01:37.084
Nice try, Oprah.

01:37.152 --> 01:38.620
I know you're lying.

01:38.688 --> 01:41.022
I've been celibate for six days,
and my senses are heightened.

01:41.089 --> 01:42.256
I'm not.

01:42.325 --> 01:43.658
Look, I told you my, my biggest fear

01:43.726 --> 01:45.960
was losing my best friend,
and that didn't happen.

01:46.028 --> 01:48.562
So there's no weirdness
between you two at all?

01:48.630 --> 01:50.164
It's only weird if we make things weird,

01:50.232 --> 01:51.833
and we're not making it weird.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.434
That's weird.

01:53.501 --> 01:55.569
Amy, you just handed Karma your heart,

01:55.637 --> 01:57.738
and she chopped it up
like a spicy tuna roll.

01:57.806 --> 01:59.373
Hey, she's not the enemy.

01:59.441 --> 02:01.675
We both did some pretty messed up things.

02:01.743 --> 02:03.744
She lied about being a lesbian

02:03.812 --> 02:05.546
to be popular and sleep with Liam.

02:05.613 --> 02:06.980
What do you have to feel guilty about?

02:07.048 --> 02:10.317
There you are.

02:10.384 --> 02:14.355
Oh... Hey... You.

02:14.422 --> 02:16.757
Hey... Oh...

02:16.825 --> 02:19.759
Oh, gosh, look at the time.

02:19.827 --> 02:23.897
I... I'm late for...

02:23.965 --> 02:25.431
stuff.

02:25.499 --> 02:29.702
Call ya later, weirdo.

02:29.770 --> 02:31.271
What were you guys, uh, talkin' about?

02:31.339 --> 02:33.740
Nothin', just gay stuff.
You know how it is.

02:33.807 --> 02:35.575
Great, more secrets.

02:35.642 --> 02:37.744
I promise they're not about you.

02:37.811 --> 02:40.946
<i>Hey, we still on for crashing
sing-along frozen tonight?</i>

02:41.014 --> 02:43.649
I was up all night workin' on our costumes.

02:43.717 --> 02:46.719
Yeah, sure.

02:46.787 --> 02:49.622
Pick me up at 8:00?

02:49.690 --> 02:52.124
"5:00 to 5:30, bake snickerdoodles."

02:52.192 --> 02:53.859
Startin' out strong, I like it.

02:53.927 --> 02:56.095
"5:30 to 5:45, eat snickerdoodles."

02:56.162 --> 02:57.396
Hmm.

02:57.463 --> 03:00.266
"5:45 to 6:00, regret
eating snickerdoodles."

03:00.333 --> 03:01.333
Sounds like a lot.

03:01.401 --> 03:02.834
We could dial it back,

03:02.903 --> 03:05.371
which will give us more time
for the trashy magazine quizzes.

03:05.438 --> 03:07.572
"How well do you really know Beyonce?"

03:07.640 --> 03:08.807
Hmm.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.743
"Are you good-girl hot or bad-girl hot?"

03:11.811 --> 03:15.881
And "do you secretly have
a crush on your b-f... "

03:15.948 --> 03:18.884
Maybe not that one.

03:18.951 --> 03:20.752
What's the big black box at 6:30?

03:20.820 --> 03:22.521
<i>Our Twilight hate-watch black hole.</i>

03:22.588 --> 03:24.523
We're gonna lose all
concept of space and time.

03:24.590 --> 03:25.856
Sign me up for all of it.

03:25.925 --> 03:27.792
Perfect, now let's get out of our clothes

03:27.859 --> 03:28.993
and into some sweats.

03:32.197 --> 03:33.764
I'm sorry.

03:33.832 --> 03:35.833
Is this weird? I... I'm
just tryin' to act normal.

03:35.901 --> 03:37.868
What? Oh, yeah, no, yeah, totally.

03:37.937 --> 03:39.170
It just...

03:39.238 --> 03:42.172
My face is doin' this, because...

03:42.240 --> 03:44.642
I really need to pee.

03:48.647 --> 03:50.047
- Occupied.
- Oh.

03:50.114 --> 03:51.515
I'll just wait until you're
through. Don't mind me.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.083
Get out of here.

03:53.151 --> 03:54.652
Not until we talk.

03:54.719 --> 03:56.186
Whatever it is you want to say can wait

03:56.254 --> 03:57.621
till I'm not on the toilet.

03:57.689 --> 03:59.356
No, it can't.

03:59.424 --> 04:01.624
Fine. What is it?

04:01.692 --> 04:06.163
Uh... I... I was...

04:06.230 --> 04:10.334
I was wondering if you...

04:10.401 --> 04:12.469
If you wanted to hang out
with me and Karma this weekend.

04:12.536 --> 04:14.537
Why? We hate each other.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.656
We do not.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.057
Turn around. I need to wipe.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.328
We just got started on the wrong foot.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.630
And now that we're sisters,

04:23.697 --> 04:26.098
we should really give it another shot.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.467
Lucky for you, my plans canceled.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.080
Looks like I'm not the only
one havin' a crappy day.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.614
I'm havin' a crappy week.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.650
Man, I hate to brag, but
mine was the crappiest.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.818
I just moved here from Decatur
to live with my grandma,

04:46.886 --> 04:48.386
'cause my pops went to prison for sleepin'

04:48.454 --> 04:49.655
with one of his patients.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.389
- That sucks.
- Yeah,

04:51.457 --> 04:53.559
and he's a veterinarian.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.561
I'm just [Bleep] with
ya. He's a pediatrician.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.033
- Really?
- No, not really.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.068
Wow, you're gullible.

05:03.135 --> 05:05.303
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- He's a mortician.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.139
But leadin' with the other two
doesn't make it sound as bad.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.575
Okay, you win; you definitely
had the crappiest week.

05:10.642 --> 05:12.077
Thank you.

05:12.144 --> 05:14.612
If I help you change that flat,
can my prize be a ride home?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.847
- Got a deal.
- All right.

05:16.915 --> 05:20.585
While we work, will you explain
to me what the deal is here?

05:20.652 --> 05:24.823
Today in the cafeteria, they served tempeh.

05:25.691 --> 05:27.858
- What the hell is that?
- Soybean cake.

05:27.926 --> 05:31.295
If you marinate it the right
way, it tastes just like...

05:31.362 --> 05:33.497
Feet.

05:33.565 --> 05:34.465
That's nasty.

05:38.503 --> 05:40.404
I'm so full I look pregnant.

05:40.472 --> 05:42.906
When I think about how many
calories I just ingested,

05:42.974 --> 05:44.408
I want to cry.

05:44.476 --> 05:46.743
Yeah, that was disgusting.

05:46.811 --> 05:49.513
It was like watching two hyenas feeding.

05:49.581 --> 05:52.282
You're not allowed to
participate in cookie remorse

05:52.350 --> 05:53.950
unless you ate one.

05:54.018 --> 05:56.552
Hey, I are half of one,

05:56.621 --> 06:00.356
and instead of complaining,
I'm gonna work it off tomorrow.

06:00.424 --> 06:02.659
Hmm, is it cold in here, or is it just me?

06:02.727 --> 06:05.461
Both: It's you.

06:05.529 --> 06:10.233
I'm gonna go grab my fuzzy socks.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.369
Okay, what's going on?

06:13.437 --> 06:14.604
Is she blackmailing you again?

06:14.671 --> 06:16.105
Because if so, we should call the cops.

06:16.173 --> 06:17.806
No, why do you ask?

06:17.874 --> 06:21.377
Because you invited her
to be our third wheel,

06:21.445 --> 06:23.946
unless you want to have a third wheel,

06:24.014 --> 06:25.848
because you feel weird
about being alone with me.

06:25.915 --> 06:27.449
What?

06:27.517 --> 06:30.218
Stop smoking crack. I
just feel bad for her.

06:30.286 --> 06:33.255
This whole intersex thing
really humanized her.

06:33.322 --> 06:34.389
Poor thing.

06:34.457 --> 06:38.927
[Sighs] Yeah, it is really sad.

06:38.995 --> 06:43.365
Oh, it was just so much easier
when we could just hate her.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.069
♪ She was the first penitentiary... ♪

06:48.137 --> 06:51.105
Okay, Sven, check out your antlers.

06:51.174 --> 06:52.407
Oh, hello.

06:52.475 --> 06:54.008
Shane, meet Theo.

06:54.076 --> 06:56.211
He's new at school, so I
invited him out with us tonight.

06:56.279 --> 06:57.979
Oh, you can be Elsa. I have the dress.

06:58.047 --> 07:00.715
I was gonna wear it,
but it felt... expected.

07:00.783 --> 07:02.116
Nah, I'm good.

07:02.184 --> 07:04.185
Actually, we were talkin'
about a change of plans.

07:04.252 --> 07:06.654
Theo knows this great
dive bar just outside town.

07:06.722 --> 07:08.289
The police are too scared to go in there.

07:08.356 --> 07:09.724
And that's a good thing?

07:09.792 --> 07:11.025
Yeah, they don't card.

07:11.093 --> 07:13.061
I'm not exactly dressed for that.

07:13.128 --> 07:16.097
I know, I'm sorry, I just
think is my speed tonight.

07:16.165 --> 07:17.398
If you don't want to go, I get it.

07:17.465 --> 07:18.832
We'll just drop you off on the way.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.601
No, it's fine.

07:20.669 --> 07:23.136
I'll just... "Let it go."

07:23.205 --> 07:24.771
"Let it go."

07:24.839 --> 07:27.708
But I'm gonna change first.

07:27.775 --> 07:31.212
He must go all out for Halloween.

07:31.279 --> 07:34.715
It is epic.

07:36.050 --> 07:37.884
You gonna watch the whole movie on mute?

07:37.952 --> 07:40.754
Yeah, so we could add our commentary.

07:40.822 --> 07:42.689
Why do vampires glisten in the sun?

07:42.757 --> 07:45.225
What evolutionary purpose
could that possibly serve?

07:45.292 --> 07:46.760
It makes Edward more dreamy.

07:46.828 --> 07:47.894
Mm. Mm-mm.

07:47.962 --> 07:49.395
He's a paler than a marshmallow,

07:49.463 --> 07:51.564
you could watch a movie off his forehead.

07:54.935 --> 07:58.137
Back me up, Lauren.

07:58.205 --> 08:00.005
Well, he's 200 years old

08:00.073 --> 08:01.907
and hitting on a 16-year-old girl.

08:01.975 --> 08:04.110
- That's kind of gross.
- Thank you.

08:04.177 --> 08:05.945
Then again, there's something irresistible

08:06.012 --> 08:07.813
about a rich, brooding bad boy.

08:07.881 --> 08:09.715
Totally.

08:09.783 --> 08:11.617
And they're always scowling at each other.

08:11.684 --> 08:13.552
They don't look like
they're having a good time.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.187
Of course they are. He's her O.T.P.

08:15.255 --> 08:17.056
- O.T.P.?
- One true pairing.

08:17.124 --> 08:18.290
She means they're soul mates.

08:18.358 --> 08:20.325
Exactly.

08:20.393 --> 08:22.927
But then again, maybe
Jacob's her soul mate?

08:22.995 --> 08:26.298
After all, he's been her loyal
friend for her whole life.

08:26.366 --> 08:27.899
So loyal.

08:27.967 --> 08:30.702
Maybe she's been too dazzled
by Edward's disco ball skin

08:30.770 --> 08:32.304
to see that they'd be perfect together.

08:32.371 --> 08:34.038
But she doesn't feel that way about Jacob,

08:34.106 --> 08:36.107
even if part of her wishes she did.

08:36.174 --> 08:37.376
Maybe if she tried...

08:37.443 --> 08:39.144
she's in love with Edward.

08:39.211 --> 08:42.179
<i>Jeez, are we still talking about Twilight?</i>

08:49.532 --> 08:51.367
Oh, I can't believe we're here.

08:51.434 --> 08:53.001
But I shouldn't be watching this.

08:53.069 --> 08:55.103
My parents would call this sorcery.

08:55.171 --> 08:58.106
Can I take a selfie?

08:58.174 --> 08:59.674
Oh, I should move.

08:59.742 --> 09:02.944
You guys probably want to hold hands.

09:03.012 --> 09:04.512
Lauren, can I speak to you for a moment?

09:04.580 --> 09:06.214
But Bella's about to
give birth to Renesmee.

09:06.282 --> 09:07.648
It's important.

09:07.716 --> 09:10.951
And that is the stupidest
character name ever.

09:11.019 --> 09:13.220
- I love your braid...
- What's wrong, sis?

09:13.288 --> 09:15.155
- You seem upset.
- I was nice enough to invite

09:15.223 --> 09:17.091
you to hang out with us.
And you invite those two.

09:17.158 --> 09:18.926
Please. You weren't being nice.

09:18.994 --> 09:21.128
I overheard everything you and Karma said.

09:21.196 --> 09:25.132
Of course you did, that's
your signature move.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.001
- Look, about that...
- Karma was right.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.869
You only invited me
because things are so weird

09:28.937 --> 09:30.204
between you two.

09:30.272 --> 09:32.539
So I thought I'd make them weirder.

09:32.607 --> 09:34.141
Things aren't weird between us.

09:34.209 --> 09:38.245
Really? So there are no
more secrets between you?

09:38.313 --> 09:39.346
Nope.

09:39.414 --> 09:42.016
Everything's out in the open.

09:42.083 --> 09:46.553
Let's put that to the test.

09:46.621 --> 09:49.355
Who's up for some truth or date?

09:49.424 --> 09:51.124
What? Seriously?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.261
Welcome to bait and tackle.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.763
This place is awesome.

09:56.831 --> 09:59.065
It smells like pee.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.499
Uh, just in this corner.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.101
- Who's up for a game of pool?
- Yeah, I'm in.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.669
Shane, you got the winner.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.344
Oh, that's right.

10:11.412 --> 10:14.147
I live in Texas.

10:15.816 --> 10:21.620
Ketchup, chocolate sauce, vinegar, and...

10:21.688 --> 10:23.155
2 cups of Mayo.

10:23.222 --> 10:26.224
Oh, plus...

10:26.292 --> 10:27.760
[Hacks]

10:29.930 --> 10:32.230
It's not fair you get to go first.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.400
I rolled a six. You can always chose truth.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.103
Give your friends a chance
to get to know you better.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.122
My turn.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.924
- Come on. Please?
- Oh, please.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.225
Me, me, me, me, me.

11:01.293 --> 11:02.627
Pick me. Pick me. Pick me. Pick me.

11:02.695 --> 11:03.761
- Karma.
- Aww.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.963
Oh...

11:05.030 --> 11:06.930
Truth or dare?

11:06.999 --> 11:10.901
Uh...

11:10.969 --> 11:12.636
Dare?

11:12.704 --> 11:14.905
I dare you to kiss Amy

11:14.973 --> 11:19.043
for 60 seconds...

11:19.111 --> 11:20.011
with tongue.

11:24.749 --> 11:26.950
- Nice shot.
- [Bleep] You, you monkey butt.

11:27.018 --> 11:29.352
Oh, well [Bleep] you
too, you [Bleep] [Bleep].

11:29.420 --> 11:32.088
I hate you and your
[Bleep] face [Bleep]wad.

11:32.156 --> 11:33.957
Whoa. Hey, you okay?

11:34.025 --> 11:36.426
Finally a guy who cares about me,

11:36.494 --> 11:38.094
unlike that piece of [Bleep].

11:38.162 --> 11:40.463
Never should have gotten his
named tattooed on my back...

11:40.531 --> 11:42.198
Uh, can I please see it?

11:42.266 --> 11:44.467
It would really turn my evening around.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.104
Whoa.

11:48.172 --> 11:51.341
Uh... maybe you could change
it into a flower or a dolphin

11:51.409 --> 11:52.342
or something?

11:52.410 --> 11:56.311
Hey, you hittin' on my girl?

11:56.379 --> 11:58.047
I'm guessing you're Bubba.

11:58.114 --> 12:00.416
But don't worry. She's not really my type.

12:00.483 --> 12:03.019
Not your type? Are you a homo?

12:03.086 --> 12:05.421
I am a homo... a homo sapien.

12:05.488 --> 12:07.122
What species are you?

12:07.190 --> 12:09.091
I'm a heterosexual.

12:09.159 --> 12:10.426
Really?

12:10.493 --> 12:11.994
'Cause you're standing awfully close,

12:12.062 --> 12:14.063
but you should know I'm not into back hair,

12:14.130 --> 12:15.630
and I'm guessing you've got a lot.

12:15.698 --> 12:16.965
Uh, we were just leaving.

12:17.033 --> 12:18.767
It's time for his seizure medication.

12:18.834 --> 12:21.136
I got this.

12:21.204 --> 12:25.006
Ugh!

12:25.075 --> 12:26.808
That seemed like a much
better idea in my head.

12:30.713 --> 12:32.080
Let's roll.

12:36.072 --> 12:38.373
Time starts when your tongues touch.

12:53.922 --> 12:56.323
Actually, you know what?
I'm... I'm gonna go with truth.

12:58.093 --> 12:59.827
Both: Boo.

12:59.895 --> 13:01.629
How was sex with Liam Booker?

13:01.697 --> 13:02.997
Ooh, good one.

13:03.064 --> 13:05.032
I'm curious about that myself.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.503
Um...

13:09.570 --> 13:10.905
It was fine.

13:10.972 --> 13:13.840
Nothing to write home about.

13:13.909 --> 13:17.544
Amy, do you agree?

13:17.612 --> 13:19.880
What? Excuse me?

13:19.948 --> 13:23.017
Didn't you guys have a threesome?

13:23.084 --> 13:27.186
O... oh... Yeah, we didn't
go through with it, though,

13:27.254 --> 13:28.522
and, Lisbeth, it's not your turn.

13:28.589 --> 13:31.758
There are rules for a reason, people.

13:31.826 --> 13:34.461
Okay.

13:34.529 --> 13:37.631
I chose... Lauren.

13:37.698 --> 13:39.132
Truth or dare?

13:39.199 --> 13:41.200
Dare.

13:45.105 --> 13:46.639
And then, Liam, you punched that guy

13:46.706 --> 13:48.174
with the bottle when he tried to hit me.

13:48.242 --> 13:50.009
And then, Shane... but,
Shane, oh, my goodness,

13:50.077 --> 13:52.345
those were some crazy-ass
Tarantino moves back there.

13:52.413 --> 13:53.646
Where'd you learn how to do that?

13:53.713 --> 13:54.914
Nepal.

13:54.982 --> 13:56.916
I was raised by a group of Shaolin monks.

13:56.983 --> 13:59.284
- No way.
- Of course not.

13:59.352 --> 14:00.886
When you grow up gay in Texas,

14:00.954 --> 14:02.588
you sign up for tae kwon do early.

14:02.656 --> 14:03.956
Okay, Shane, here you go, man.

14:04.023 --> 14:06.124
Nighty-night.

14:06.192 --> 14:07.660
What's gotten into you?

14:07.727 --> 14:09.061
I don't want to talk about it.

14:09.128 --> 14:10.629
If you have something to say, say it.

14:10.697 --> 14:12.264
Fine.

14:12.332 --> 14:14.032
I think you picked that fight tonight.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.234
- Why would I do that?
- Because you were jealous.

14:16.302 --> 14:18.636
Of Theo? Of course not.

14:18.704 --> 14:19.771
Don't be ridiculous.

14:19.839 --> 14:21.139
Besides, I like him.

14:21.207 --> 14:22.574
You know, he had my back.

14:22.641 --> 14:24.242
You're the one who tried to
pull me away when that guy

14:24.310 --> 14:25.743
was being a total dickwad.

14:25.811 --> 14:27.079
I was just tryin' to protect you,

14:27.146 --> 14:29.581
which is more than you did for me.

14:29.648 --> 14:30.815
What are you talking about?

14:30.883 --> 14:32.750
You kept Amy's secret at my expense.

14:32.818 --> 14:35.052
You basically chose her over me.

14:38.724 --> 14:40.324
That's not what happened.

14:40.392 --> 14:42.594
Well, that's what it feels like.

14:42.661 --> 14:43.995
- Liam...
- I'm done talking about it.

14:44.062 --> 14:45.997
Please, go.

14:55.073 --> 14:57.875
Um... should I move to the front?

14:59.244 --> 15:01.945
I'm ready. Just do it.

15:02.014 --> 15:04.280
[Electric shaver buzzing]

15:11.890 --> 15:14.090
- I can't do it.
- Oh, thank God. My turn.

15:14.158 --> 15:16.527
Oh.

15:16.594 --> 15:18.829
Hand it over. I'll do it.

15:18.897 --> 15:19.996
Truth. Truth. I choose truth.

15:20.064 --> 15:22.798
Just shut that thing off.

15:22.866 --> 15:26.102
Hmm...

15:26.170 --> 15:27.570
What to ask...

15:27.638 --> 15:29.639
Hmm.

15:29.706 --> 15:34.377
How about, were you born
different than the rest of us?

15:34.445 --> 15:39.448
Are you in love with Liam Booker?

15:39.516 --> 15:44.654
Are you taking hormones?

15:44.721 --> 15:47.389
Have you ever masturbated
thinking about Karma?

15:53.096 --> 15:54.163
I don't want to play anymore.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.201
Is green really your favorite color?

16:02.300 --> 16:03.800
Amy? Can I come in?

16:03.868 --> 16:06.736
I don't want to talk about it.

16:06.804 --> 16:09.773
Since when has that stopped me before?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.674
Ugh, I wish I never told you.

16:11.742 --> 16:13.443
It changed everything.

16:13.511 --> 16:15.144
No, it didn't.

16:15.212 --> 16:16.846
Karma, when our hands touched,

16:16.914 --> 16:18.782
you pulled yours away like I had ebola.

16:18.849 --> 16:20.617
And that kiss...

16:20.684 --> 16:22.886
Admit it; you're grossed out
that I'm attracted to you.

16:22.953 --> 16:25.854
No, I'm not.

16:25.923 --> 16:27.957
I swear I'm not grossed out.

16:28.025 --> 16:29.591
I'm flattered.

16:29.659 --> 16:31.327
Yeah, right.

16:31.395 --> 16:34.363
I just wish that I felt the same way.

16:34.431 --> 16:35.798
I know how painful it must be,

16:35.865 --> 16:38.234
and I don't want to make it worse.

16:38.302 --> 16:41.137
It's not like I know how
to stop being irresistible.

16:43.706 --> 16:47.375
Wow, did you really just say that?

16:47.444 --> 16:48.977
Yeah, I really did.

16:49.045 --> 16:50.846
I'm sorry.

16:50.914 --> 16:54.450
I'm doing this all wrong; I just
don't know what the rules are.

16:54.517 --> 16:56.852
I don't know, either.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.787
Well, we can't figure it out
if we don't talk about it,

16:59.855 --> 17:03.091
no matter how uncomfortable it is.

17:03.159 --> 17:06.027
Yeah, I know.

17:06.095 --> 17:10.365
Like, can we sleep in
the same bed together?

17:10.433 --> 17:13.201
'Cause if not, I'm happy
to sleep on the couch.

17:13.269 --> 17:14.836
Okay, well...

17:14.903 --> 17:17.037
I'm not "happy," but I'll do it.

17:20.075 --> 17:22.209
I think I can handle that.

17:22.277 --> 17:24.078
Yay.

17:24.145 --> 17:27.047
And how do you feel about back rubs?

17:27.115 --> 17:29.684
I think we have to work up to that.

17:29.751 --> 17:31.452
Got it, no worries.

17:31.519 --> 17:34.421
I'm patient.

17:34.489 --> 17:35.990
No, don't... stop.

17:36.057 --> 17:38.725
Don't do it. No. Stop it.

17:38.793 --> 17:42.196
Sure I feel bad but not that bad.

17:42.263 --> 17:44.764
Amy was really struggling. She needed me.

17:44.832 --> 17:46.500
Liam's straight; He doesn't understand

17:46.567 --> 17:49.268
how confusing it is to
question your sexuality.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.437
That's true, but have
you thought about things

17:51.506 --> 17:53.507
from Liam's point of view?

17:53.574 --> 17:54.941
I don't want to think about things

17:55.009 --> 17:56.209
from Liam's point of view.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.378
I want to bitch to my boyfriend.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.847
Honey, I hear you're in pain,

18:00.915 --> 18:02.849
but this is one of those
times when you have to decide

18:02.917 --> 18:04.950
whether to feed the good
wolf or the bad wolf.

18:05.019 --> 18:07.053
Not the [Bleep] wolves again.

18:07.121 --> 18:09.322
That's it. I can't. We're done.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.427
If you expect me to apologize,
don't hold your breath.

18:14.495 --> 18:16.896
Come to think of it, hold it.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.398
Look, I'm sorry. You were right.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.599
I did invite you because
I wanted a third wheel.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.734
Thank you.

18:21.801 --> 18:22.968
But I feel really bad about it,

18:23.036 --> 18:24.737
especially after what you shared with us...

18:24.804 --> 18:26.338
Okay, zip it. I don't need your pity.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.541
In fact, I'm the one that
should be pitying you.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.076
For what?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.310
I think you slept with Liam,

18:32.378 --> 18:36.248
and now you have to live
with the crushing guilt.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.816
What? That's insane. Why would you even...

18:38.884 --> 18:40.718
I found the empty box for
your morning-after pill

18:40.786 --> 18:44.622
in the bathroom.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.824
Don't worry. I won't tell Karma.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.427
And I'm supposed to trust you?

18:48.494 --> 18:50.162
I had my chance last night,

18:50.229 --> 18:54.098
but as much as I wanted
to, we're sisters now,

18:54.166 --> 18:55.700
and there's a code.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.636
Besides, even I'm not that cruel.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.605
It would kill her.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.873
I know.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.243
It's hard to keep secrets that big.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.212
Trust me, I know.

19:10.715 --> 19:14.452
Well, I don't pity you.

19:14.519 --> 19:16.587
Actually, I feel closer to you.

19:16.654 --> 19:19.356
That's what happens when you let people in.

19:19.424 --> 19:20.757
I should write that down.

19:20.825 --> 19:24.128
"Life lessons from my
sexually confused stepsister."

19:24.196 --> 19:27.163
♪ I smell waffles ♪

19:27.231 --> 19:30.266
What are you guys talking about?

19:30.334 --> 19:32.535
Oh, you know, just sister stuff.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.042
I have a medical condition

19:39.110 --> 19:41.044
called androgen insensitivity syndrome,

19:41.112 --> 19:44.046
and the side effects include
good hair, great skin,

19:44.115 --> 19:46.048
and no body odor.

19:46.117 --> 19:49.051
Oh, cool. Can we get it too?

19:57.361 --> 19:59.762
It's not something you can get.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.331
I was born with XY chromosomes,

20:02.398 --> 20:04.600
but I developed as a female, okay?

20:04.668 --> 20:06.568
The pills I take are
estrogen, because my body

20:06.637 --> 20:08.203
doesn't make any.

20:08.271 --> 20:10.506
There.

20:10.573 --> 20:12.742
Now you know.

20:12.809 --> 20:14.343
Can you have kids?

20:24.720 --> 20:27.922
If it makes you feel better, I have eczema.
