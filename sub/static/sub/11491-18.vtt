WEBVTT

00:04.701 --> 00:07.135
from your child support
check this month.

00:07.136 --> 00:11.406
Because I paid
for Jake's haircut.

00:11.407 --> 00:12.841
Yes, it is usually nine dollars,

00:12.842 --> 00:15.043
but he wanted to go someplace
without hobbyhorses.

00:16.979 --> 00:19.514
I know he's never gonna win
any beauty contests,

00:19.515 --> 00:22.050
but he is our son.

00:22.051 --> 00:24.519
Look, I've got a patient.
I got to go.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.522
Sorry you had to hear that.

00:29.058 --> 00:30.958
That's, uh, that's my ex-wife.

00:32.295 --> 00:34.195
Bee-yatch.

00:38.568 --> 00:40.469
Hello, Mrs. Honeycutt.
I'm Dr. Harper.

00:40.470 --> 00:41.636
Doctor.

00:41.637 --> 00:44.639
Okay, so you are having
spasms in your lower back?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.108
Yeah, it's awful.

00:46.109 --> 00:48.176
Some days I can't
even get out of bed.

00:48.177 --> 00:49.377
Oh, I know how that is.

00:49.378 --> 00:51.079
You have back problems, too?

00:51.080 --> 00:53.548
No.

00:53.549 --> 00:55.450
Anyway, why don't
you lie face down,

00:55.451 --> 00:57.352
and we'll see if we
can locate the problem.

00:57.353 --> 00:58.720
I've tried everything.

00:58.721 --> 01:00.655
Acupuncture,

01:00.656 --> 01:02.224
yoga, shiatsu.

01:02.225 --> 01:03.925
Nothing seems to work.

01:03.926 --> 01:05.260
Not surprised.

01:05.260 --> 01:08.096
Those Eastern practices
are mostly hooey.

01:08.097 --> 01:09.831
Modern chiropractic,
on the other hand,

01:09.832 --> 01:12.434
is built on over 50 years
of solid science.

01:12.435 --> 01:17.405
Okay, let's take a look
at what we've got here.

01:17.406 --> 01:19.341
Okay, now is this
too much pressure?

01:19.342 --> 01:21.343
No.

01:21.344 --> 01:22.611
Okay, how about this?

01:22.612 --> 01:24.012
No.

01:24.013 --> 01:26.314
Okay, now is this
where the spasms occur?

01:26.315 --> 01:27.482
A little lower.

01:27.483 --> 01:28.750
Okay.

01:28.751 --> 01:29.818
Here?

01:29.819 --> 01:30.952
Lower.

01:30.953 --> 01:32.053
Here?

01:33.156 --> 01:34.289
Am I hurting you?

01:34.290 --> 01:36.958
No! God, no!

01:38.528 --> 01:41.763
Nobody's touched me like this
since my husband died.

01:41.764 --> 01:44.332
Oh, um, I'm so sorry.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.001
Um, how long has
it been since...?

01:46.002 --> 01:48.136
That long, huh?

01:50.473 --> 01:53.975
Oh, my, it's, uh, pretty...
pretty sensitive here.

01:53.976 --> 01:55.043
Harder!

01:55.044 --> 01:58.180
Oh, okay, no problem. Um...

01:58.181 --> 02:01.149
So, just out of curiosity,
how did you find me?

02:01.150 --> 02:03.218
Uh, referral?
Uh, my Web site?

02:03.219 --> 02:05.120
Or the fliers
on the counter

02:05.121 --> 02:07.122
of the Mongolian barbecue
across the street?

02:07.123 --> 02:08.657
Shut up and rub!

02:08.657 --> 02:11.560
Uh, I'm not technically rubbing.

02:11.561 --> 02:13.428
Whoa!
Whoa, Nellie. Whoa!

02:13.429 --> 02:15.831
Don't stop!
I'm not stopping.

02:15.832 --> 02:16.798
Oh, spank me!

02:16.799 --> 02:18.867
I'm-m sorry?

02:18.868 --> 02:21.169
Spank my lonely ass!

02:21.170 --> 02:23.705
What?!
Do it, bitch!

02:23.706 --> 02:26.441
Yes, Doctor, harder!

02:26.442 --> 02:27.676
Yes!

02:27.677 --> 02:32.747
Oh, God, yes!

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.664 --> 02:51.233
Okay, let's take a look
at the schedule.

02:51.234 --> 02:54.836
See what the, uh, rest of
the afternoon looks like.

02:54.837 --> 02:57.038
Oh, that's not too bad.

02:58.107 --> 03:00.709
So, how are you liking
your first day at work here?

03:03.679 --> 03:05.313
Thank you, Dr. Harper.

03:05.314 --> 03:07.282
Uh, you are most welcome.

03:07.283 --> 03:11.119
A- And remember, alternating
an ice pack with a heating pad

03:11.120 --> 03:13.054
is, uh, very helpful
for spasming.

03:13.055 --> 03:15.290
I'd like to make
another appointment.

03:15.291 --> 03:16.524
Oh, sure, sure. Uh...

03:16.525 --> 03:18.627
What were you thinking?
Maybe next week, or...?

03:18.628 --> 03:19.895
Tonight.

03:19.896 --> 03:20.996
Uh, tonight?

03:20.997 --> 03:23.431
Oh, oh, gloriosky.

03:23.432 --> 03:26.968
Uh, uh... well, we, uh...
we close up at 5:00, so...

03:26.969 --> 03:29.170
So I can expect you
at my place at 9:00.

03:29.171 --> 03:32.641
Oh, gee. Uh, I-I don't
do house calls.

03:33.409 --> 03:35.877
Per se.

03:35.878 --> 03:37.778
See you at 9:00.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.189
Uh, some patients pay in cash.

03:49.659 --> 03:52.894
Uh, uh, their insurance, uh,
won't cover chiropractic.

03:52.895 --> 03:56.932
Uh, part of our ongoing
health care crisis.

03:56.933 --> 03:58.833
Tragic, really.

04:00.836 --> 04:04.406
Uh, by the way, you are doing
one heck of a job.

04:05.841 --> 04:08.043
In fact, here's a little
something for you.

04:09.245 --> 04:11.846
Just 'cause your smile
lights up the place.

04:12.815 --> 04:15.250
You know what?
Let's sweeten the pot.

04:16.084 --> 04:18.353
Um, can you give me ten back?

04:19.422 --> 04:21.189
Not a problem.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.425
Can't put a price on a smile.

04:24.860 --> 04:30.932
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

04:54.796 --> 04:56.163
I like the new look.

04:56.164 --> 04:57.197
Thanks.

04:57.198 --> 04:58.932
It's fashion forward.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.200
What does that mean?

05:00.201 --> 05:01.335
I don't know.

05:01.336 --> 05:03.137
It's what the guy
who cut my hair said.

05:03.138 --> 05:05.773
He also said
it was "fun and fabulous."

05:05.774 --> 05:06.940
Really?

05:06.941 --> 05:08.909
Yeah, and he invited Dad
to a party.

05:11.713 --> 05:13.714
I didn't go.

05:13.715 --> 05:15.416
It's just nice to be asked.

05:15.417 --> 05:20.020
So, why'd you decide to abandon
your classic cereal bowl coif?

05:20.021 --> 05:21.722
What's a "coif"?

05:21.723 --> 05:23.557
You can't glean it
from the context?

05:23.558 --> 05:25.392
What's "glean"?

05:25.393 --> 05:27.628
Why'd you change
your freakin' hair?

05:27.629 --> 05:29.530
My new girlfriend
wanted me to.

05:29.531 --> 05:30.798
If your new girlfriend
wanted you

05:30.799 --> 05:32.700
to jump off a bridge,
would you do that?

05:32.701 --> 05:36.070
If she put her tongue in my
mouth when she asked me, yeah.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.539
Well, I can't blame you.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.507
I once bought a woman a car
for the same reason.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.409
She put her tongue
in your mouth?

05:43.511 --> 05:46.547
Sure, let's say mouth.

05:46.548 --> 05:49.249
Can we get
the check, please?

05:49.250 --> 05:51.752
Hey, why don't you let
me get this one?

05:51.753 --> 05:54.121
Really? You're not going
to go for the world record?

05:54.122 --> 05:55.155
What are you talking about?

05:55.156 --> 05:58.125
1,647 meals in a row

05:58.126 --> 06:00.294
where you haven't taken out
your stupid Velcro wallet.

06:00.295 --> 06:01.729
You were counting?

06:01.730 --> 06:02.696
Am I close?

06:02.697 --> 06:06.734
Nevertheless, I'm paying.

06:07.836 --> 06:09.103
You smell that, Jake?

06:09.104 --> 06:10.838
The air coming out
of your father's wallet

06:10.839 --> 06:13.307
has been in there since
before you were born.

06:13.308 --> 06:14.675
Very funny.

06:14.676 --> 06:16.343
Thank you.

06:16.344 --> 06:17.678
Wait, wait, wait.

06:17.679 --> 06:19.613
Nobody is going to believe this.

06:19.614 --> 06:21.682
For God's sake.

06:28.089 --> 06:30.624
Hey, isn't that
Chelsea's friend, Gail?

06:31.426 --> 06:33.060
Oh, yeah.

06:33.061 --> 06:34.995
I wonder if I should
say hello.

06:34.996 --> 06:36.196
I wouldn't mind
saying hello.

06:36.197 --> 06:39.733
Finish paying the
check, you weasel.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.935
Hey, Dad, as long as you
got your wallet out,

06:41.936 --> 06:43.470
I could use
some new sneaks.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.972
Hmm. Oh...

06:44.973 --> 06:46.873
Sure.

06:47.275 --> 06:49.175
Are you dying?

06:51.679 --> 06:52.780
Charlie.

06:52.781 --> 06:54.481
Oh, hi, Gail.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.984
Great to see you.

06:56.985 --> 06:58.118
How've you been?

06:58.119 --> 06:59.620
Pretty good. You?

06:59.621 --> 07:01.889
Well, you know...

07:01.890 --> 07:04.358
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear
about you and Chelsea.

07:04.359 --> 07:05.626
The way it goes.

07:05.627 --> 07:07.094
Win some, lose some.

07:07.095 --> 07:09.163
Start having liquor delivered
straight to your house-

07:09.164 --> 07:10.731
you don't have
to put on pants.

07:10.732 --> 07:13.400
Well, if it's any consolation,
I know how you feel.

07:13.401 --> 07:15.769
I'm still not over
my breakup.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.238
But I'm not much
of a drinker, so...

07:18.239 --> 07:19.940
Cheers.

07:19.941 --> 07:23.644
Have you, uh...
have you seen Chelsea?

07:23.645 --> 07:25.612
Yeah, actually I had
dinner with her, and...

07:26.381 --> 07:27.848
We had dinner
just the other night.

07:27.849 --> 07:29.349
Her and Brad?

07:29.350 --> 07:31.718
Yeah, come to think
of it, he was there.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.453
Looks like they're
an item now.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.688
I guess.

07:34.689 --> 07:35.823
You guess?

07:35.824 --> 07:37.825
What do you want
from me, Charlie?

07:37.826 --> 07:39.226
They're in Mexico
for the weekend.

07:39.227 --> 07:41.161
Mexico. Nice.

07:41.162 --> 07:42.896
I went there with
her once.

07:42.897 --> 07:43.897
I'm sorry.

07:43.898 --> 07:44.998
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.099
We had a great time.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.502
In fact, when we got
back, I bought her a car.

07:49.871 --> 07:51.772
Yeah, she told me.

07:51.773 --> 07:54.107
Ooh...

07:54.108 --> 07:57.010
Listen, I got to go, but...

07:57.011 --> 07:58.612
if you ever want to talk.

07:58.613 --> 08:00.247
Oh, thank you.

08:00.248 --> 08:02.249
Bye.
Bye-bye.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.652
For the last time, I am not
dying and I'm not sick.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.254
Everything's fine.

08:07.255 --> 08:08.689
Okay, I got it.

08:08.690 --> 08:11.558
But you can understand
my skepticism, right?

08:13.628 --> 08:15.863
âª Men. âª

08:18.333 --> 08:20.801
I really don't see why
I shouldn't ask her out.

08:20.802 --> 08:23.470
Seriously? The woman is
Chelsea's best friend.

08:23.471 --> 08:25.005
So?

08:25.006 --> 08:27.507
She's single, I'm single.
She's lonely, I'm lonely.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.277
She's gorgeous,
I'm well above average.

08:30.278 --> 08:32.446
I'm just saying it's a bad idea.

08:32.447 --> 08:34.881
<i>I never said
it wasn't a bad idea.</i>

08:34.883 --> 08:37.451
I said I don't know why
I shouldn't do it.

08:39.254 --> 08:40.320
What's that?

08:40.321 --> 08:42.054
That's a portable massage table.

08:42.056 --> 08:44.458
So, what, you're givin'
rub-and-tugs on the pier now?

08:44.459 --> 08:46.293
No.

08:46.294 --> 08:47.895
No, I am a licensed
professional,

08:47.896 --> 08:50.130
and-and I will not stand here

08:50.131 --> 08:52.766
and be accused
of unethical behavior.

08:52.767 --> 08:55.135
I mean, just because you have
no moral compass

08:55.136 --> 08:56.637
doesn't mean I don't.

08:56.638 --> 08:58.705
And while, yes,
that's a triple negative,

08:58.706 --> 09:00.240
it nevertheless defines me

09:00.241 --> 09:03.076
as the man for whom
I am aiming to be!

09:03.077 --> 09:05.612
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:05.613 --> 09:08.482
I am just trying
to augment my income

09:08.483 --> 09:11.018
by seeing clients
in their homes,

09:11.019 --> 09:14.421
thus alleviating them of the
added stress of commuting,

09:14.422 --> 09:16.924
not to mention speed bumps
and potholes, of which,

09:16.925 --> 09:19.126
as you know,
can jostle the spine!

09:22.263 --> 09:27.234
Wow, guy picks up one $30 check
and he has a brain aneurysm.

09:28.903 --> 09:32.072
âª Men. âª

09:37.779 --> 09:39.479
Yeah?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.715
Chelsea?

09:41.716 --> 09:43.617
Hey! How are ya?

09:43.618 --> 09:46.820
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
slow down, slow down.

09:46.821 --> 09:49.356
Why are you crying?

09:49.357 --> 09:51.258
Wait a minute.

09:51.259 --> 09:54.127
You're in Mexico?

09:54.128 --> 09:57.197
Why on Earth are you in Mexico?

09:57.198 --> 10:01.568
Oh, sure, Brad.

10:01.569 --> 10:06.707
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry
it's not working out.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.309
Well, I love you
and I miss you, too.

10:09.310 --> 10:11.345
When are you gonna be back?

10:11.346 --> 10:14.348
Okay, okay,
I'll-I'll see you tomorrow.

10:14.349 --> 10:16.083
I... can't wait.

10:16.084 --> 10:17.984
All right, bye-bye, sweetie.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.092
I hope that smile's
for me.

10:28.763 --> 10:32.666
Uh, who else
would it be for?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.802
âª Men. âª

10:38.158 --> 10:39.692
âª Men. âª

10:39.693 --> 10:42.161
You ready for round two?

10:42.162 --> 10:45.698
Well, um...
yes and no.

10:45.699 --> 10:47.867
Something wrong?

10:47.868 --> 10:49.769
Yeah.

10:49.770 --> 10:51.571
While you were in
the bathroom,

10:51.572 --> 10:53.172
uh, Chelsea called.

10:53.173 --> 10:55.074
Really?

10:55.075 --> 10:58.110
Apparently, things didn't
go well in Mexico,

10:58.111 --> 10:59.512
and she's coming home.

10:59.513 --> 11:00.880
Well, that's a shame.

11:00.881 --> 11:02.548
Yeah.

11:02.549 --> 11:04.951
Anyway, she wants
to see me.

11:04.952 --> 11:07.486
Said she loves me
and misses me.

11:07.487 --> 11:10.990
So, one call and you're just
gonna go running back?

11:10.991 --> 11:14.060
Um, yeah.

11:16.463 --> 11:20.466
Well... this is awkward.

11:20.467 --> 11:23.002
Come on. You know how
I feel about her.

11:23.003 --> 11:24.737
I do.

11:24.738 --> 11:28.641
So, we should probably keep
what happened tonight

11:28.642 --> 11:30.176
just between us, right?

11:30.177 --> 11:31.978
Mum's the word?

11:31.979 --> 11:33.279
Zip the lip?

11:33.280 --> 11:35.915
Ixnay on the oggie day
aisle stay?

11:35.916 --> 11:38.985
Of course.

11:41.455 --> 11:44.557
You know,
we could just pretend

11:44.558 --> 11:46.892
that you didn't get
the phone call

11:46.893 --> 11:49.495
for, like, another hour.

11:49.496 --> 11:51.597
We could, couldn't we?

11:53.033 --> 11:56.869
But wouldn't that
be... wrong?

11:56.870 --> 11:59.805
I won't tell
if you don't.

11:59.806 --> 12:03.109
Uh, I'm sorry, Gail.

12:03.110 --> 12:05.244
I can't, I can't
justify it to myself.

12:05.245 --> 12:06.946
Okay.

12:06.947 --> 12:09.749
Well, can I at least kiss
you good night?

12:09.750 --> 12:11.650
Sure.

12:19.626 --> 12:21.560
On the other hand,

12:21.561 --> 12:24.063
there's no arguing
with a boner.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.101
âª Men. âª

12:29.102 --> 12:30.469
Let's see.

12:30.470 --> 12:32.304
When Gail came over,

12:32.305 --> 12:35.941
it was 11:00 here
and midnight in Cabo.

12:35.942 --> 12:37.510
When Chelsea called,

12:37.511 --> 12:40.546
it was midnight here
and 1:00 in Cabo.

12:40.547 --> 12:43.349
So when I did Gail at 12:10,

12:43.350 --> 12:46.819
Chelsea technically
hadn't called yet.

12:48.255 --> 12:51.190
Not my best work,
but I can live with it.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.929
Hey.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.970
Tough night, Bunky?

13:04.971 --> 13:07.239
I'm a whore, Charlie.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.974
Don't be so hard on yourself.

13:08.975 --> 13:11.243
Jake needed a haircut,
and you had no money.

13:11.244 --> 13:13.312
What? No, no!

13:13.313 --> 13:16.749
I took money
to give a woman pleasure.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.317
Wait a minute.

13:18.318 --> 13:21.554
<i>You... gave a woman pleasure?</i>

13:21.555 --> 13:24.623
Oh, you have no idea what
powerful orgasms

13:24.624 --> 13:26.959
these hands are capable
of delivering.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.561
No, no, no.
I've always known that.

13:28.562 --> 13:29.895
I just find it hard to believe

13:29.896 --> 13:31.864
<i>they could give them
to other people.</i>

13:34.568 --> 13:38.537
Yeah, well, maybe this'll
convince you.

13:40.841 --> 13:42.074
A woman gave you this?

13:42.075 --> 13:43.876
Uh-huh, right before she told me

13:43.877 --> 13:46.846
she was done with me and I could
show myself out.

13:46.847 --> 13:48.614
Sounds like a dream date to me.

13:48.615 --> 13:49.949
So what's the problem?

13:49.950 --> 13:51.751
How do I live with myself?

13:51.752 --> 13:53.452
How did you live with yourself
before?

13:53.453 --> 13:56.021
By thinking I was better
than you.

13:56.022 --> 13:59.225
Now after all these years, I've
finally descended to your level.

13:59.226 --> 14:00.459
Oh, no-no-no, no, no.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.528
I may have done some
questionable things in my life,

14:02.529 --> 14:04.897
but I have never taken money
for it.

14:05.899 --> 14:08.000
That's not to say
it wasn't offered.

14:08.735 --> 14:10.803
Deservedly so.

14:10.804 --> 14:12.304
Fine, I'm worse than you.

14:12.305 --> 14:14.740
That's all I'm saying.

14:14.741 --> 14:16.575
Well, I am going
to take a shower

14:16.576 --> 14:18.310
and try to wash
the cheapness off me.

14:18.311 --> 14:21.147
Better take some steel wool
and a cheese grater.

14:22.682 --> 14:24.316
Hey, Alan.

14:24.317 --> 14:26.652
Oh, Gail...

14:26.653 --> 14:29.188
Hi.

14:29.189 --> 14:31.690
Don't judge me, Pretty Woman.

14:34.661 --> 14:36.495
Charlie, I better
get going.

14:36.496 --> 14:37.596
Right, right.

14:37.597 --> 14:39.431
So, uh, you and I are okay?

14:39.432 --> 14:41.567
Yeah. I'm just sorry
it has to end.

14:41.568 --> 14:42.902
Yeah, me, too.

14:42.903 --> 14:44.103
Chelsea's a lucky girl.

14:44.104 --> 14:45.871
You think so?
You should tell her.

14:45.872 --> 14:47.406
I mean, don't tell her.

14:47.407 --> 14:49.141
Bye.

14:49.142 --> 14:51.076
Bye-bye.

14:53.713 --> 14:55.581
Thank you, Charlie.

14:55.582 --> 14:57.082
For what?

14:57.083 --> 15:00.419
<i>Proving once again that
I am better than you.</i>

15:01.087 --> 15:03.255
Hey, hey, I'm just a rascal!

15:03.256 --> 15:06.025
You are a male prostitute!

15:09.296 --> 15:11.897
That is a terribly hurtful thing
to say.

15:18.939 --> 15:20.773
âª Men. âª

15:20.774 --> 15:23.275
So there we are in this
beautiful hotel room

15:23.276 --> 15:24.476
overlooking the ocean,

15:24.477 --> 15:26.512
and he's on the phone
with his mother trying

15:26.513 --> 15:28.581
to help her download music
to her iPod.

15:28.582 --> 15:29.582
You're kidding!

15:29.583 --> 15:31.350
And I just sat there thinking,

15:31.351 --> 15:32.885
"Charlie would never do this.

15:32.886 --> 15:35.287
Charlie hates his mother
with a blind passion!"

15:35.288 --> 15:38.557
Remember when you used to think
that was a bad thing?

15:38.558 --> 15:41.293
<i>And when Brad's not on the phone
with his mother,</i>

15:41.294 --> 15:43.996
he's telling me how much
I remind him of his mother.

15:43.997 --> 15:45.898
I hope not while
you were in bed,

15:45.899 --> 15:48.667
'cause that would reflect badly
on everybody.

15:48.668 --> 15:49.969
You don't wanna know.

15:49.970 --> 15:51.704
<i>There's nothing to know.</i>

15:51.705 --> 15:53.372
You went to Mexico
with another man,

15:53.373 --> 15:54.974
he talked about his mother
in bed,

15:54.975 --> 15:56.508
and you didn't have sex
with him.

15:56.509 --> 15:57.776
Charlie...

15:57.777 --> 15:59.879
Nope! That's what happened.
End of story.

16:01.381 --> 16:03.582
I should never have let zou go.

16:03.583 --> 16:06.819
Well, sometimes you can't
appreciate what you've got

16:06.820 --> 16:10.689
until you go to Mexico and don't
have sex with a mama's boy.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.259
I'm sorry about Brad.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.960
I know that hurt you.

16:14.961 --> 16:16.896
Ah, it's water under the bridge.

16:16.897 --> 16:19.064
What you did, what I did,
doesn't matter.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.065
What did you do?

16:20.066 --> 16:22.034
Doesn't matter.

16:22.035 --> 16:24.203
Charlie, no secrets.

16:24.204 --> 16:26.005
Please, can't I just have one?

16:26.006 --> 16:27.706
Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter.

16:27.707 --> 16:29.607
We were separated.

16:31.177 --> 16:33.279
All right, here goes.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.948
I was having pizza with Alan
and Jake the other day.

16:35.949 --> 16:37.816
By the way,
Jake got a new haircut.

16:37.817 --> 16:39.717
It's just fabulous.

16:40.287 --> 16:44.523
Okay, well, you'll never guess
who was there getting takeout.

16:45.558 --> 16:47.326
Your old buddy Gail.

16:47.327 --> 16:49.628
Oh, my God, you didn't.

16:49.629 --> 16:52.464
I didn't say I did,
but good guess.

16:52.465 --> 16:55.834
I don't believe you!

16:55.835 --> 16:57.503
What?! We were separated.

16:57.504 --> 16:59.038
You were in Mexico
with another man.

16:59.039 --> 17:00.539
But she's my best friend!

17:00.540 --> 17:03.509
Yeah, well, I'd have to say
the jury's still out on that.

17:03.510 --> 17:05.544
You are such a pig!

17:05.545 --> 17:08.380
A- A-A pig who hates his mother.

17:08.381 --> 17:09.647
Go to hell!

17:09.648 --> 17:12.117
Oh, come on!

17:12.117 --> 17:14.954
It was 1:00 in Cabo!

17:14.954 --> 17:16.255
âª Men. âª

17:16.256 --> 17:19.892
Oh! Lower.

17:19.893 --> 17:22.027
How about here?

17:22.028 --> 17:25.531
Oh, yeah...

17:25.531 --> 17:29.068
that's how
Mommy likes it.

17:29.069 --> 17:30.135
Okay, you know what?

17:30.136 --> 17:31.637
I'm sorry.
I- I can't do this.

17:31.638 --> 17:33.172
What's wrong?

17:33.173 --> 17:34.540
I am a professional.

17:34.541 --> 17:36.308
I studied chiropractic

17:36.309 --> 17:37.876
for three years
in Guadalajara.

17:37.877 --> 17:40.646
And that was with almost no
Spanish language skills

17:40.647 --> 17:43.716
and a family of parasites
living in my colon.

17:43.717 --> 17:45.551
And I did not go through
all of that

17:45.552 --> 17:48.954
to become some sort
of G-spot Johnny.

17:48.955 --> 17:51.123
Is that what you think you are?

17:51.124 --> 17:54.026
Well, you're giving me money,
and I'm giving you...

17:54.027 --> 17:55.694
what I'm giving you.

17:55.695 --> 17:57.296
It just, it makes me feel cheap.

17:57.297 --> 17:59.598
So it's too much
like a business transaction.

17:59.599 --> 18:00.599
Exactly.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.368
Well, how about
we forget the money,

18:02.369 --> 18:05.204
<i>and I'll show you something
I learned in Guadalajara?</i>

18:05.205 --> 18:07.840
What?

18:10.110 --> 18:14.313
âª Ai, yi, yi, yi! âª

18:14.314 --> 18:18.450
âª Canta y no llores... âª

18:18.451 --> 18:19.852
âª Men. âª

18:24.824 --> 18:27.426
Oh, hey, hi.

18:27.427 --> 18:28.727
I'm sorry.

18:28.728 --> 18:30.029
I overreacted.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.297
Yeah, you kinda did.

18:32.298 --> 18:34.900
You're both single,
you're both adults,

18:34.901 --> 18:36.568
and you and I were separated.

18:36.569 --> 18:40.706
Plus you were honest with me, so
I'm willing to put it behind us.

18:40.707 --> 18:42.941
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

18:42.942 --> 18:44.176
I love you so much.

18:44.177 --> 18:45.611
I love you, too.

18:45.612 --> 18:48.414
Why don't I take you out

18:48.415 --> 18:51.316
for a nice lunch
and we'll catch up?

18:51.317 --> 18:52.651
You wanna go out?

18:52.652 --> 18:53.819
I'm a little hungry.

18:53.820 --> 18:54.987
Aren't you a little hungry?

18:54.988 --> 18:57.956
Gail's upstairs, isn't she?

18:59.159 --> 19:02.528
Once again, we were separated
and I was vulnerable!

19:03.363 --> 19:05.130
Just so we're on the same page,

19:05.131 --> 19:08.767
are we still together or am I
allowed to go back upstairs?!

19:08.768 --> 19:12.104
Oh, damn!

19:18.912 --> 19:22.247
Oh, how much madder
could she get?

19:22.248 --> 19:24.216
âª Men. âª

19:26.039 --> 19:27.740
Okay, well, I think
we're making good progress

19:27.741 --> 19:28.874
with the back spasms.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.509
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll see you on Wednesday.

19:30.510 --> 19:31.677
Looking forward to it.

19:31.678 --> 19:33.246
Uh, and Mrs. Honeycutt?
Yes?

19:33.247 --> 19:34.780
Uh, if
it's okay with you,

19:34.781 --> 19:36.882
I think I'd like to go back
to our original arrangement.

19:36.883 --> 19:38.884
But you said
it made you feel cheap.

19:38.885 --> 19:41.921
<i>What can I say?
Turns out I am cheap.</i>

19:41.922 --> 19:43.789
Your call. Bye-bye.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.690
Bye.

19:53.467 --> 19:57.003
Have I told you lately that you
are doin' a great job?

19:58.038 --> 20:00.206
'Cause you are doin'
a great job!

20:01.642 --> 20:05.945
In fact, I am going to make you
employee of the month.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.849
I want an adjustment.

20:11.952 --> 20:13.052
Uh, I'm sorry.

20:13.053 --> 20:14.487
Are-Are you having
back problems?

20:14.488 --> 20:18.524
No, I want an adjustment
like you give her.

20:20.827 --> 20:24.263
Oh, gee, I-I don't think
that would be appropriate.

20:24.264 --> 20:28.434
All right, then I want a raise
and dental insurance.
