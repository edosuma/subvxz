WEBVTT

00:06.041 --> 00:09.250
I had all these arcade games
shipped from Hachmachistan.

00:09.291 --> 00:12.583
There's Smack-A-Genie, Yak-Man,
and Mule King Junior.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.709
Oh, dude, I'll play Mule King Junior.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.041
So, how do I play?

00:25.166 --> 00:26.625
That is how you play.

00:26.709 --> 00:27.709
You won, baby!

00:27.792 --> 00:28.834
What?

00:28.917 --> 00:29.917
Oh, I don't believe it.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.750
That was my first time playing.

00:32.291 --> 00:33.625
Hey, how do I get more tokens?

00:33.709 --> 00:36.333
Ah. You put your dollar
in the Chi Chi Change Machine

00:36.417 --> 00:38.000
and then you will get your tokens.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.750
Oh, all right.

00:44.083 --> 00:45.375
What the heck was that?

00:45.458 --> 00:46.792
That was the Chi Chi.

00:59.083 --> 01:01.083
Jerry, dude, why aren't you training?

01:01.166 --> 01:02.959
Your black belt test
is in a couple of days.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.834
You know how important this is to Rudy.

01:04.917 --> 01:06.500
There isn't anywhere he'd rather be.

01:06.583 --> 01:09.417
I am outta here!

01:10.917 --> 01:13.166
Headed to Beijing for two weeks.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.667
<i>Karate Magazine</i> just named me
Sensei of the Year.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.125
What about our test?

01:18.208 --> 01:19.375
What test?

01:19.458 --> 01:20.917
Our belt ranking test.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.917
Oh! Oh, that test.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.041
Of course.
I take belt ranking very seriously.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.375
Milton's going for his blue--

01:27.500 --> 01:28.458
- Brown.
- Brown.

01:28.542 --> 01:29.709
And Jerry's going for his green--

01:29.792 --> 01:30.667
- Black.
- Black.

01:30.750 --> 01:31.959
- And that's why Jeff --
- Jack!

01:32.041 --> 01:34.542
Jack will be giving you your test
while I'm in Japan.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.417
China!
- Whatever!

01:38.291 --> 01:40.125
Hey, guys, you know what
the best part about

01:40.208 --> 01:41.625
being named Sensei of the Year is?

01:41.709 --> 01:44.125
You finally get the recognition
you deserve.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.709
No.

01:46.291 --> 01:48.125
I get to rub it in Ty's face.

01:49.125 --> 01:51.583
I just called him
at his new job at Roll-A-Rubs

01:51.667 --> 01:52.875
and he's on his way over now.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.792
Roll-A-Rubs, mobile massage!

01:57.667 --> 01:59.625
I'm looking for, uh, "Harry Bunz."

02:00.792 --> 02:01.792
Harry Bunz?

02:02.875 --> 02:04.375
I need Harry Bunz.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.542
What's so funny? I want Harry Bunz!

02:56.667 --> 02:57.792
Whew.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.917
Counting is hard, man. Here's your tip.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.250
I can't believe you.

03:05.291 --> 03:07.166
Jack told us that we had to do
a hundred push-ups

03:07.250 --> 03:08.417
before he got back.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.750
You see, that's the difference
between you and I, Milton.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.834
I'm not worried about what Jack thinks.

03:13.750 --> 03:14.875
He's coming.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Nine hundred ninety-nine...

03:22.083 --> 03:23.458
One thousand!

03:23.542 --> 03:25.250
Whoo!

03:25.333 --> 03:26.667
Try to keep up, Milton.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.667
I know you just did your
fake sweat spray bottle thing.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.875
I can't believe you think that.

03:33.375 --> 03:36.667
Jerry, you're the most
physically gifted guy in the dojo.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.834
I'm right here.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.750
Sorry.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.000
But you also need discipline and focus
if you want to get your black belt.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.875
Dude, before I came to this dojo,
I was just a skate punk

03:48.959 --> 03:50.417
who didn't take karate seriously.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.750
You may not remember this,

03:52.834 --> 03:54.709
but before I came to the dojo,

03:54.792 --> 03:56.500
I was kind of a nerd.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.041
You have a real shot here.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.375
I'm not gonna let you blow it.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.583
So, to help personally train you
for your test,

04:05.667 --> 04:08.834
I brought in one of the best
and best-looking black belts I know.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.625
Gary from Super Kicks?

04:12.291 --> 04:13.792
Surprise!

04:16.500 --> 04:19.500
I know, you were hoping
for Gary from Super Kicks.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.875
Yeah.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.000
I can't believe you came here
for our belt tests.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.792
I wouldn't miss it.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.917
Okay, Jerry. For your black belt test

04:31.000 --> 04:33.041
you're gonna fight off
three attackers at once.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.792
Here, I'll show you how it's done.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.583
All right, come at me, you guys!

04:53.625 --> 04:54.875
Wow.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.500
If I have to do that to get my black belt

04:56.583 --> 04:59.083
I'm gonna have to train harder
than I've ever trained before.

05:00.709 --> 05:03.291
Whew, I am beat.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.709
I don't know if I have another one in me.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.875
But we won't know until we try.

05:09.542 --> 05:10.792
Hit it, Petey!

05:17.583 --> 05:20.875
Uh, excuse me, ladies.
Training for my brown belt here.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.333
Yeah. This is a dojo, not a disco!

05:26.583 --> 05:28.417
Oh, okay, you wanna dance?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.959
Fine! Let's go, Shakira!

05:37.959 --> 05:40.667
Oh, too much man for you, huh?

05:42.291 --> 05:44.750
Always too much man.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.959
Yo, yo, yo.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.417
What it do, girl?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.583
-
- What?

05:54.583 --> 05:56.417
How can you have a party
when you're supposed to be

05:56.500 --> 05:57.917
training with Kim in the park?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.458
If you keep acting this way,
you're gonna fail your test.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.083
Oh, Milton.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.125
Lighten up, man.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.917
Rudy's gone, Jack's giving us the test.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.291
He's not gonna fail us, he's our boy!

06:10.375 --> 06:13.458
So let's crank up the music and...

06:13.542 --> 06:16.208
Crank it right back down, people.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.709
I had nothing to do with this.

06:22.792 --> 06:24.000
I was sucked into this

06:24.083 --> 06:25.709
tawdry shuffle that was a nightmare

06:25.792 --> 06:28.291
of flailing arms and swaying hips.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.959
Oh, and mother help me,

06:31.041 --> 06:32.750
I liked it.

06:34.709 --> 06:37.667
Jerry, you're wasting my time and Kim's.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.083
Uh, where is Kim?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.291
There you are!

06:40.417 --> 06:43.083
You left me waiting in the park
for the past two hours.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.417
I thought maybe you got attacked
by that crazy lady.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.458
- What crazy lady?
- Me!

06:48.542 --> 06:50.750
You left me waiting in the park
for the past two hours!

06:50.834 --> 06:51.792
Hey.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.917
It's clear you're not ready.

06:55.542 --> 06:58.041
I'm cancelling your test
and suspending you from the dojo.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.291
- What?
- You don't deserve to wear a black belt.

07:05.709 --> 07:08.583
You may be able to shut this party down
and kick me out,

07:08.667 --> 07:10.750
but you will not take my dignity.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.625
I will walk out of here
with my head held high!

07:21.417 --> 07:23.959
Hey, why is the Jerry sad?

07:24.333 --> 07:27.458
Is it because no girls like you
or because you're bad in the schoolyard,

07:27.542 --> 07:28.834
or because no girls like you?

07:28.917 --> 07:29.917
No!

07:31.083 --> 07:32.417
No, it's Jack.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.667
Dude, he used to be my best friend.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.709
Now he's just a big jerk
who thinks he better than everyone.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.792
Oh, I hear you, brochacho.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.709
Jack is the worst.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.166
Always coming in late,
messing up the orders,

07:45.250 --> 07:47.250
and bragging about his new pony.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.625
Phil, who're you talking about?

07:50.709 --> 07:52.792
Jack, Jack Anderson.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.208
I hate you, Jack Anderson!

08:02.375 --> 08:04.208
No, I meant Jack Brewer.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.000
Oh, Jack Brewer!

08:06.083 --> 08:08.166
Jack Brewer is the best.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.875
He even signed a picture
of himself for my wall of Jacks.

08:13.917 --> 08:17.125
Notice who's not up there, Jack Anderson!

08:21.959 --> 08:24.500
Oh, no, Ty is back.

08:24.792 --> 08:28.041
Ever since I got the Smack-A-Genie,
he's in here playing all day.

08:31.208 --> 08:34.291
<i>You lose! No wish for you!</i>

08:35.875 --> 08:37.417
There goes this month's rent.

08:39.834 --> 08:40.917
Hey, man.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.291
I'll rub your feet for a token.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.709
I don't think so.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.333
Oh, come on bro, I need this.
I gotta smack the genie.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.125
Smack it bad, I tell you!

08:52.458 --> 08:53.709
I said no.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.417
Kid!

08:58.834 --> 09:00.083
Give me a token!

09:01.417 --> 09:02.625
Come back!

09:17.917 --> 09:19.417
Jack thinks he's all that.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.041
'Cause he's in charge.

09:22.125 --> 09:25.250
Well, if it wasn't for him,
I'd already have my black belt.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.458
You don't deserve to wear a black belt.

09:32.709 --> 09:34.959
Oh, really? Well, take this, Jack!

09:37.875 --> 09:40.417
<i>Winner! New high score!</i>

09:40.500 --> 09:42.583
<i>What is your wish, master?</i>

09:42.667 --> 09:45.333
Oh, my wish? Oh, you wanna know my wish?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.208
I wish Jack had never come to the dojo.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.458
<i>Your wish is my command.</i>

09:58.250 --> 10:00.291
<i>Jerry? Jerry?</i>

10:01.375 --> 10:02.375
You okay?

10:02.458 --> 10:04.834
I think so.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.875
Phew.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.375
Can't have anything bad happen
to my favorite black belt.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.458
Did you say, "black belt"?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.917
This is my favorite photo of you.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.542
I love you, Jack Anderson.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.709
Wait, wait, wait, what?

10:32.417 --> 10:33.792
Jack's picture is gone?

10:35.166 --> 10:36.792
And I'm a black belt?

10:38.041 --> 10:39.208
It worked.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.375
Everything's changed!

10:42.709 --> 10:44.792
Oh... Hey, hey, hey.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.542
What it do, girl?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.875
Well, almost everything's changed.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.917
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

11:03.208 --> 11:05.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.667
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pick that paper up.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.208
See, I'm a black belt.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.458
And these hands are weapons.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.291
You... you do realize you're not
actually a black belt?

11:21.792 --> 11:24.750
This is your uniform.
You work at Rudy's black belt massage.

11:30.458 --> 11:33.709
Weapons of relaxation.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.375
Yo, why is there a Black Dragon
sign on your dojo?

11:44.458 --> 11:46.333
You know that I lost my dojo
three years ago

11:46.417 --> 11:48.583
when we didn't win that tournament
against the Black Dragons.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.875
What is wrong with you?

11:51.959 --> 11:53.709
You must've really hit
your head when you fell.

11:53.792 --> 11:54.917
Wait.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.417
So the Black Dragons own the dojo
and I'm a masseuse?

12:00.041 --> 12:02.166
Dude, this isn't how
I imagined this life would be.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.750
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:03.834 --> 12:05.709
I should be running
a chain of beauty salons

12:05.792 --> 12:07.375
called "Uncle Scissors."

12:08.542 --> 12:10.542
Really? That's your dream?

12:10.625 --> 12:11.583
No.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.792
No, I just started talking
before I realized I didn't have a dream,

12:14.875 --> 12:16.083
and that's what came out.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.417
Chop, chop, Rudy.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.291
These shoulders aren't
gonna rub themselves.

12:27.792 --> 12:31.208
Get to work, Jerry.
I want all my piggies taken to the market.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.083
Ugh! Dude!

12:37.166 --> 12:38.875
How many toes do you have?

12:40.583 --> 12:41.750
None of your business.

12:41.834 --> 12:43.792
Just take all 17 of them to the market.

13:01.709 --> 13:02.875
Milton?

13:06.709 --> 13:07.792
Milton?

13:09.125 --> 13:10.375
Dude, that is you.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.208
What happened?

13:12.291 --> 13:16.041
Uh, I woke up, drove into work...

13:16.125 --> 13:17.834
Then you asked me that question.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.417
Whew. Busy day.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.959
Dude, please tell me
you don't wear that to school.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.583
I don't do school, man. Remember?

13:28.667 --> 13:30.834
I dropped out 'cause
I couldn't handle the bullies.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.875
But I did get this sweet job.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.291
Hey.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.458
So because Jack
wasn't there to protect you,

13:43.959 --> 13:47.709
you got picked on, dropped out, gave up,
and now you're a token jockey?

13:47.792 --> 13:49.834
Dude, I'm a lot more than that.

13:49.917 --> 13:53.125
Uh... I refill the token machines.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.667
I take the tokens out of the games,

13:54.750 --> 13:56.125
I give tokens to the kids.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.500
Dude!

13:57.583 --> 14:00.291
I'm a token jockey! Sweet!

14:06.208 --> 14:08.417
No, the Black Dragons are coming.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.208
I must blow the horn of warning.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.792
Ah, forget it.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.917
The Black Dragons are coming!

14:18.000 --> 14:19.917
The Black Dragons are coming!

14:21.500 --> 14:23.333
Make room for the Phil.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.333
<i>Not cool, dude.</i>

14:28.417 --> 14:29.959
<i>I told you to make room.</i>

14:34.083 --> 14:35.709
It's three o'clock, where's our food?

14:35.750 --> 14:38.000
You know I hate waiting for my burger!

14:38.083 --> 14:40.417
You know I hate it
when he hates waiting for his burger.

14:41.709 --> 14:44.208
Wait, Jack? Kim?

14:45.166 --> 14:47.041
Dude, why are you guys
dressed like Black Dragons?

14:50.250 --> 14:52.291
Dude, why are you guys
acting like Black Dragons?

14:54.542 --> 14:57.125
Yeah, I'm beginning to think you guys
are Black Dragons.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.375
Yo, thanks for getting me down.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.583
Oh, I had to, man.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.917
That kid just bought you for 500 tickets.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.000
Five hundred tickets?

15:12.083 --> 15:14.166
The plastic whistle was 3,000!

15:14.250 --> 15:16.500
You want this, you better ticket up, brah.

15:20.709 --> 15:23.375
So Kim must have convinced Jack
to join the Black Dragons,

15:23.458 --> 15:24.917
and now they're both bullies.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.417
What's your bag, man?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.792
It's like you made some kind of
trippy wish in an alternate universe,

15:31.875 --> 15:33.542
and now you're like stuck in one of those

15:33.625 --> 15:35.875
be-careful-what-you-wish-for
type situations.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.875
I've been there, bro'.

15:38.834 --> 15:42.125
It's all because I made a wish
on that stupid Smack-A-Genie machine.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.500
Oh...

15:44.583 --> 15:46.250
We used to have one of those,

15:46.333 --> 15:48.542
but Ty took it to his dojo.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.834
Yo Milton, I have a plan.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.542
Look, you're gonna help me sneak

15:55.625 --> 15:58.000
into the Black Dragons' Dojo
and distract them.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.375
Then I'll get the high score
and wish things back.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.959
I'm in, but we need a plan, dude.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.375
But I just told you the...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.125
Okay, I know we're in trouble
when I'm the smart one.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.709
We gotta get out of here, quick.

16:10.792 --> 16:12.083
Why, the Black Dragons are here?

16:12.166 --> 16:15.000
No, Billy's coming back
and he's got enough tickets to own you.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.291
-
- Go, run!

16:23.333 --> 16:24.792
You want to get a good grip,

16:24.875 --> 16:26.750
and in one movement, rip up.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.375
That, my friend, is a black belt wedgie!

16:32.875 --> 16:35.166
You know what the worst part
about picking on a nerd is?

16:35.500 --> 16:37.166
Nothing.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.500
Hey, what are you two freaks doing here?

16:42.583 --> 16:45.375
Uh, we're just running
a very special promotion.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.917
Free massages to a very
select group of clientele.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.917
Yeah, teachers, soldiers,
ice skaters, bullies, and evil senseis.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Yes! I'm an ice skater!

16:56.709 --> 16:58.250
And an evil sensei.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.166
So, uh, just remain calm,

17:08.250 --> 17:09.667
relax,

17:09.750 --> 17:11.417
and no matter what you hear...

17:11.500 --> 17:13.208
keep looking down.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.834
- Hey, what is that pounding noise?
- Uh...

17:27.750 --> 17:29.041
That's...

17:29.125 --> 17:32.250
the sound of relaxation
knocking at your doors.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.250
So just let it in, hon.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.750
-
- Thank you, Seaford!

17:55.166 --> 17:57.250
Hey, that loser's playing our game.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.417
Whoa!

18:02.458 --> 18:05.041
<i>Five more genies to high score.</i>

18:17.583 --> 18:20.125
<i>Winner! New high score!</i>

18:20.208 --> 18:21.792
<i>What is your wish, master?</i>

18:21.875 --> 18:23.834
I wish things were back
to the way they were!

18:24.834 --> 18:27.250
<i>Jerry? Hey, Jerry, get up, man.</i>

18:27.750 --> 18:29.166
Jerry? Jerry--

18:29.250 --> 18:31.041
No, no, no, please don't!

18:32.250 --> 18:33.375
Wait...

18:33.750 --> 18:35.000
Wait, wait, wait.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.542
Jack's picture is on the wall.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.000
And I'm not a black belt.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.291
And Milton...

18:43.375 --> 18:45.041
Milton, you don't have a lame haircut.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.083
Well, no, you do,
but it's a different lame haircut.

18:48.667 --> 18:49.667
I'm home.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.458
Jerry. Jerry, take it easy.

18:51.542 --> 18:52.875
Yeah, dude, you were out for a while.

18:52.959 --> 18:55.083
And how is my haircut lame?

18:58.083 --> 18:59.166
Jack...

19:00.709 --> 19:02.458
Dude, I'm sorry I took you for granted.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.208
Look, from this moment on,

19:04.291 --> 19:06.375
I'm gonna take this
black belt test seriously.

19:07.417 --> 19:08.417
You know...

19:09.417 --> 19:11.458
because of you,
all of our lives are a lot better.

19:12.667 --> 19:13.959
Speak for yourself.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.500
You haven't been
massaging Harry Bunz all day.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.208
Jerry, you've trained hard
these past two weeks.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.625
You can do this, I believe in you.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.208
Hey, hey!

19:50.875 --> 19:51.959
Oh!

19:52.041 --> 19:54.000
Hey, I was just watching.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.166
Congratulations, Jerry.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.834
You're now a black belt.

20:02.542 --> 20:04.125
Thank you, sensei.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.917
Look at you, man. I'm so proud.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.959
Hey, there's only one thing left to do...

20:09.417 --> 20:11.792
Black belt party!

20:16.375 --> 20:19.417
Oh, yeah, that's my jam.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.792
I can't believe I'm actually
saying this, but uh...

20:25.875 --> 20:27.625
I even missed her dance.

20:40.166 --> 20:42.583
<i>Winner! New high score!</i>

20:42.667 --> 20:44.750
<i>What is your wish, master?</i>

20:54.208 --> 20:56.417
<i>Winner! New high score!</i>

20:56.500 --> 20:58.667
<i>What is your wish, master?</i>

21:07.583 --> 21:10.125
<i>Winner! New high score!</i>

21:10.208 --> 21:12.208
<i>What is your wish, master?</i>

21:14.208 --> 21:15.542
There's my wish.

21:15.625 --> 21:17.667
Jack, that's so sweet.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.041
I was your wish?

21:19.500 --> 21:21.917
Yeah, no, actually,
it was my burger, so...

21:22.000 --> 21:23.333
Just gonna...

21:23.417 --> 21:25.208
That's, it's good stuff, you know.

21:26.959 --> 21:28.667
Thanks, hon, I was starving.

21:30.792 --> 21:31.834
Yes!

21:56.875 --> 21:57.792
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:02.834
<i>Yes!</i>
