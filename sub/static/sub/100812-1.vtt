WEBVTT

00:18.510 --> 00:20.847
The islands
have always been a mystery.

00:22.214 --> 00:26.753
Since the beginning,
over 1500 years ago

00:26.786 --> 00:28.821
when the first
Polynesians arrived.

00:29.889 --> 00:33.760
Following the light of the
eastern star called Nanamua.

00:35.728 --> 00:38.631
With only the stars to
guide them they sailed

00:38.665 --> 00:42.735
2,000 miles in canoes to
migrate to the islands

00:42.769 --> 00:46.371
and they believed that they
had finally found paradise.

00:47.572 --> 00:49.876
But paradise is
an elusive thing.

00:50.777 --> 00:53.612
As long as men exist.

00:56.683 --> 00:59.484
But this time new
foreigners came.

00:59.518 --> 01:02.922
Perhaps seeking this
elusive peace or bringing us

01:02.955 --> 01:04.388
a new peace.

01:05.524 --> 01:09.428
In 1820 the Thornton's
and Hiram Bingham

01:09.461 --> 01:12.865
came to the islands to
bring us the good news.

01:20.605 --> 01:21.440
Well, Reverend.

01:23.009 --> 01:25.444
I hope it's what you expected.

01:25.477 --> 01:26.378
It's more.

01:26.411 --> 01:27.312
What are you looking

01:27.345 --> 01:29.314
to do here with these savages?

01:29.347 --> 01:30.817
They're people, Skipper Jack.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.417
They're naked!

01:32.451 --> 01:33.351
It's all right, dear.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.821
Tell that to Captain Cook.

01:36.621 --> 01:39.391
They were not warmly
received when they arrived

01:39.424 --> 01:40.827
in the village.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.362
Our people have long
memories and they remembered

01:44.396 --> 01:46.565
the ghost of Captain Cook.

01:47.599 --> 01:52.270
They also despised the whalers
who preyed upon our women.

01:52.304 --> 01:53.840
All was not well.

01:53.873 --> 01:56.508
What do you want with Olani?

01:56.541 --> 01:59.411
I have a letter of
intent from Papua Akia

02:01.681 --> 02:03.983
in Boston he arranged a meeting

02:04.016 --> 02:07.486
for both myself and Chiefess.

02:07.519 --> 02:08.821
We should go this is not safe.

02:08.854 --> 02:10.322
They don't want us.

02:10.354 --> 02:11.724
Leave them be, Kanoa

02:11.758 --> 02:12.792
Ah.

02:14.459 --> 02:15.895
I am Chiefess Kapiolani.

02:17.496 --> 02:20.398
Ah, it's a pleasure to
finally meet you, Chiefess.

02:21.533 --> 02:22.869
We didn't expect
you to be so young.

02:24.771 --> 02:26.304
It is rank that matters here

02:26.338 --> 02:29.976
in the islands, Reverend
Thornton, not age.

02:30.009 --> 02:33.512
It is a pleasure to
meet all of you, come.

02:33.545 --> 02:36.816
Makana, Kapu help them
with their luggage.

02:40.418 --> 02:42.521
You have a beautiful country.

02:42.554 --> 02:44.724
And you speak English so well.

02:45.858 --> 02:47.894
The British
sailors taught us.

02:47.927 --> 02:50.462
Starting with Captain
Cook's men 50 years ago.

02:50.495 --> 02:52.932
Ah, uh-huh, well.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.003
Henry,
don't provoke them.

02:58.938 --> 03:01.741
The Chiefess has
everything under control, right?

03:01.774 --> 03:03.743
They're gesturing
towards us and pointing.

03:03.776 --> 03:05.878
Come,
come, stay with us.

03:06.646 --> 03:07.312
We didn't know what

03:07.345 --> 03:08.948
to make of these new visitors.

03:10.016 --> 03:11.984
They were not like the others.

03:12.018 --> 03:14.486
The whalers who only
wanted to drink rum

03:14.519 --> 03:16.588
and possess our women.

03:16.621 --> 03:19.524
These people were here
for something else

03:19.558 --> 03:21.560
and it made all of us uneasy.

03:22.929 --> 03:25.530
The woman you encountered
earlier in the village

03:25.564 --> 03:28.835
who was alarming anyone,
that is Priestess Kanoa.

03:28.868 --> 03:30.569
Yeah, I saw.

03:30.602 --> 03:31.938
Not everyone is like her.

03:32.604 --> 03:34.974
The gods are extremely
angry with us.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.509
I don't believe in God.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.845
Only believe in myself.

03:38.878 --> 03:40.612
Yeah, we can
see that, Skipper.

03:40.646 --> 03:41.479
The gods?

03:42.682 --> 03:45.918
Yes, Pele, she is
god of the volcano.

03:45.952 --> 03:48.353
It is she who shaped
the sacred land.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.957
We fear her greatly.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.859
Henry,
where are we going?

03:52.892 --> 03:54.961
I'm so tired, I need to rest.

03:54.994 --> 03:56.629
Why are you here?

03:56.662 --> 03:59.431
We are
just here to help.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.870
Are you
here to convert us?

04:03.903 --> 04:06.038
No, only
God can do that.

04:06.072 --> 04:07.472
Why are you here then?

04:09.108 --> 04:13.112
To help, we want to
help you in anyway we can.

04:13.145 --> 04:15.815
Why do foreigners always
think they can help?

04:15.848 --> 04:17.884
You brought guns to
our islands, remember?

04:17.916 --> 04:19.952
Hey, those guns are
here to protect you, too.

04:19.986 --> 04:20.887
From what?

04:22.520 --> 04:23.455
Other guns.

04:28.928 --> 04:30.863
Is there
something wrong?

04:30.897 --> 04:33.733
The
goddess is very angry.

04:33.766 --> 04:34.867
War is prevalent.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.743
Please correct me if I'm
wrong, but your goddess

04:43.776 --> 04:45.144
is an angry goddess?

04:46.779 --> 04:48.446
Pele is temperamental.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.917
She devours the land.

04:50.950 --> 04:53.953
She is a goddess of
citron, Halema'uma'u

04:53.986 --> 04:55.821
along with her husband Lohiahu.

04:56.656 --> 04:59.025
It was when Lohiahu
kissed another woman,

04:59.058 --> 05:02.795
her own sister, that
she covered him in lava.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.967
And how do you appease her?

05:08.968 --> 05:10.435
By sacrificing.

05:11.771 --> 05:12.872
Sacrificing what?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.841
Humans.

05:19.946 --> 05:21.948
We didn't always practice
human sacrificing.

05:23.082 --> 05:24.917
There has been a
priest from Tahiti,

05:24.951 --> 05:26.652
who brought the practice in.

05:26.686 --> 05:29.922
His name was Paow
almost 900 years ago.

05:29.956 --> 05:32.758
But it was abolished by
King Kamehameha the second

05:32.792 --> 05:34.760
only a few years ago.

05:34.794 --> 05:37.595
But some are trying
to bring it back.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.231
Who on earth would
try and bring back such

05:39.265 --> 05:40.766
a barbaric practice?

05:41.934 --> 05:43.903
Your Pele sounds like
a very jealous god.

05:45.671 --> 05:47.873
Does it not say
in your holy book

05:47.907 --> 05:49.642
that I am a jealous god?

05:50.810 --> 05:52.878
That only means,
that only means

05:52.912 --> 05:55.214
that we shall have no
other gods before him.

05:56.614 --> 05:59.018
How dare you judge us
when your culture has

05:59.051 --> 06:00.686
the same practice.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.821
I am not judging you.

06:01.854 --> 06:04.190
If I were to judge
you, you would know it.

06:04.223 --> 06:08.560
I would just suggest, we
are not trying to fool you.

06:09.628 --> 06:11.931
So what truly
is your purpose here then?

06:12.732 --> 06:16.002
We spoke with one of
your people in Boston.

06:16.035 --> 06:19.571
He came to us and shared
that there was struggle

06:19.604 --> 06:21.573
and suffering among your people

06:21.606 --> 06:23.876
and our faith moved
us to go forward

06:23.909 --> 06:26.245
and travel 10 months
in hard conditions

06:26.278 --> 06:27.980
on a broken down ship.

06:28.014 --> 06:29.915
We came here to assist you.

06:29.949 --> 06:33.819
To build, to help
you with planting

06:33.853 --> 06:35.520
and caring for the sick.

06:36.756 --> 06:37.923
And for sharing good news.

06:41.927 --> 06:42.862
Good news?

06:43.996 --> 06:45.530
So, the truth comes out.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.235
Over there is your hut.

06:49.268 --> 06:51.603
Kapu, Makana, take them.

06:57.676 --> 07:00.279
Okay, I'm going to
head back to the ship

07:00.312 --> 07:02.848
and I hope they don't have
too much ketchup here.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.283
Why?

07:04.316 --> 07:06.919
Well, to put on you
after they cook you.

07:06.952 --> 07:08.620
Good luck, farewell.

07:10.022 --> 07:10.856
Walk.

07:17.063 --> 07:19.698
I knew that
was why they had come.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.901
Our ancestor Henry Okaheo went

07:21.934 --> 07:24.937
to their land several
years ago and died.

07:24.970 --> 07:28.174
But his spirit brought
back this good news.

07:28.207 --> 07:30.042
It was about their god,

07:30.076 --> 07:32.878
but we already had
gods, many of them.

07:33.979 --> 07:36.015
Why would we need one more?

07:36.048 --> 07:38.818
What would compel them
to travel all this way

07:38.851 --> 07:40.686
to tell us about their one god?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.262
Our enemies have arrived.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.933
This is not good.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.353
Where are they from?

07:59.271 --> 08:00.772
How can you be certain

08:01.190 --> 08:03.400
they are our enemies?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.653
Because they come from the land

08:06.695 --> 08:08.322
that cursed dog Opukahaia went to.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.199
A place called America.

08:10.783 --> 08:11.917
So the
ship is leaving?

08:11.951 --> 08:13.853
Yes, it's
going back to England.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.822
And you and your
friends have stayed behind?

08:17.990 --> 08:19.158
Yes.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.960
What do they want?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.796
What do you think they want?

08:25.547 --> 08:29.801
They want to force us to
worship their God.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.471
The god of Captain Cook?

08:32.721 --> 08:35.807
Yes Captain Cook’s god.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.645
The foreign man brought guns and canons

08:41.270 --> 08:43.273
to our lands and nothing more.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.527
But these people don’t have guns.

08:47.277 --> 08:51.031
To me, it seems they are here to help.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.409
Don’t be a fool Mele!

08:54.826 --> 08:56.495
We must get them off our island.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.123
Let’s ask Pele first.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.086
We don't want to die.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.008
We will not die.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.262
They will die first.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.014
Be careful.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.476
Maybe these foreign people
are some foreign gods?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.437
Never. That’s legend.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.480
I sense fear in them.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.191
Their god has no power.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.111
Their god will not protect them from ME.

09:30.329 --> 09:31.830
What do you mean by that?

09:32.998 --> 09:36.802
Pele is angry, but her
anger will subside.

09:36.835 --> 09:38.103
I'm not talking about Pele.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.308
All due respect, Chiefess,
I'm talking about

09:42.341 --> 09:44.176
the god who created
heaven and earth.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.246
The god through which
all things were made.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.049
Nothing exists without him.

09:53.052 --> 09:55.321
May I introduce
you to Akira Endo.

09:58.357 --> 09:59.325
Nice to meet you.

10:00.492 --> 10:02.461
He is a samurai
warrior from Japan.

10:03.429 --> 10:05.965
My pleasure, how did
you end up here Mr. Endo?

10:07.299 --> 10:09.501
I was the Japanese
ambassador to Holland under

10:09.535 --> 10:13.906
the Tokugawa, but pirates
over took our ship

10:13.939 --> 10:15.241
and I was taken hostage.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.945
Incredible tale, sir.

10:21.914 --> 10:22.915
Where are you from?

10:25.818 --> 10:27.219
America.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.535
Would you look at that,
bloody missionaries.

10:45.004 --> 10:46.205
If they keep this up,
they're gonna convert

10:46.238 --> 10:47.539
the entire bloody island.

10:47.573 --> 10:49.408
Aye, that's right they will.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.543
Well I'm not gonna
let that happen.

10:51.577 --> 10:53.512
Without whiskey, without
rum, without women,

10:53.545 --> 10:55.080
what left is there?

10:55.114 --> 10:56.115
Nothing!

10:56.148 --> 10:58.050
Nothing, it's an outrage!

10:59.051 --> 10:59.918
Let's go, boys.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.641
We are all cursed.

11:23.308 --> 11:28.814
The gods are angry we have
let these foreign people into our land.

11:29.857 --> 11:34.069
They are infidels!

11:35.320 --> 11:39.950
They must die by tomorrow night.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.412
The gods are angry

11:44.580 --> 11:49.126
Kanoa has spoken with Pele

11:50.752 --> 11:53.922
so we know she is right.

11:56.008 --> 12:00.721
They must die by tomorrow night.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.348
No...

12:03.599 --> 12:07.311
Anyone who lays a hand
on them will be put to death.

12:07.811 --> 12:14.067
Then command them to LEAVE, Chiefess

12:14.526 --> 12:16.445
They’re helping us.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.405
I will not force them to leave.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.450
They are our guests.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.664
Chiefess, if the goddess demands it,

12:28.457 --> 12:31.293
we must obey. Let us sacrifice them!

12:32.419 --> 12:35.631
We cannot sacrifice the foreign man.

12:36.882 --> 12:41.261
They are defiled like women.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.809
You know human sacrifice was abolished.

12:48.227 --> 12:52.439
You will not touch anyone

12:52.981 --> 12:57.277
Mere humans cannot abolish
what the great goddess requires.

12:57.736 --> 12:58.904
Our king did.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.113
And he's human.

13:01.156 --> 13:05.410
Besides, he only issued a Kanalaa.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.497
It can be broken, Chiefess.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.334
Kamehameha is Ali’i nui

13:12.918 --> 13:15.671
because he is a descendant of the celestials!

13:16.213 --> 13:17.422
ENOUGH.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.800
I have heard from Pele.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.929
She wants to destroy us all

13:24.263 --> 13:27.499
This man does not
believe in Pele.

13:28.534 --> 13:30.002
Do you, Mr. Thornton?

13:31.303 --> 13:32.104
Answer me.

13:33.071 --> 13:35.040
I believe in god, that's all.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.110
Henry, what is going on, come.

13:42.782 --> 13:43.716
What is going on?

13:45.050 --> 13:46.552
It's all under control.

13:46.585 --> 13:47.986
- Control?
- Yes.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.055
I heard them, they
want to kill us.

13:50.088 --> 13:54.727
That's Kanoa, she
has some kind of a.

13:54.761 --> 13:56.995
This is insanity,
we must leave.

13:57.029 --> 13:57.897
God will protect us, Mary.

13:57.931 --> 13:59.131
How can you be so
sure, Brother Hiram?

13:59.164 --> 14:00.432
Psalm 91.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.304
Words will not stop a spear
from piercing your heart.

14:07.272 --> 14:09.541
God is in control
brother Henry.

14:09.575 --> 14:11.711
Yes, God is in control.

14:11.744 --> 14:14.980
This is insane,
we must leave here.

14:15.715 --> 14:18.150
I'm sorry for
what has happened.

14:19.618 --> 14:23.121
I will do everything in my
power to protect you, but.

14:23.155 --> 14:23.989
But what?

14:25.692 --> 14:27.059
You must be careful.

14:27.092 --> 14:30.162
The priestess Kanoa,
she's very powerful

14:30.195 --> 14:32.297
and she has great
influence on the people.

14:42.241 --> 14:43.743
Shoo, shoo!

14:43.776 --> 14:45.444
The foreign woman.

14:45.477 --> 14:46.646
Shoo!

14:46.679 --> 14:48.413
I don't
know why she came here.

14:48.447 --> 14:49.716
She is so miserable.

14:50.650 --> 14:51.784
Oh, I can't stand it.

14:51.818 --> 14:52.785
- I
- feel sorry for her.

14:53.753 --> 14:56.121
I don't know how much
longer they intend to stay.

14:57.724 --> 15:00.359
Oh Henry, the mosquitoes
are everywhere here.

15:00.392 --> 15:02.494
Yeah, just blame
it on Captain Cook.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.640
KAPU! COME HERE.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.772
Hurry!

15:49.074 --> 15:51.201
Kapu. Approach.

15:56.623 --> 16:02.129
I'm sorry but we must make a
sacrifice to Pele.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.714
Kipa! Nalau!

16:04.173 --> 16:05.340
Take him to the altar!

16:11.388 --> 16:12.389
Alika!

16:13.182 --> 16:15.350
Please don't do this.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.144
Enough.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.396
Take Kapu to the altar -
he will be sacrificed today.

16:19.771 --> 16:20.522
WAIT!

16:32.217 --> 16:33.753
Blame it on Captain Cook.

16:35.755 --> 16:37.155
What, what does that mean?

16:37.189 --> 16:39.558
He brought mosquitoes
to the islands.

16:39.591 --> 16:40.660
Or should I say mosquito larvae.

16:40.693 --> 16:42.829
They were in the water they
brought aboard the ships.

16:44.229 --> 16:46.398
Did he bring anything good?

16:46.431 --> 16:48.600
Yeah, towels, coats.

16:49.936 --> 16:50.903
Good morning, Reverend Henry.

16:50.937 --> 16:52.204
Good morning, Makana.

16:52.237 --> 16:53.271
Miss Mary.

16:56.341 --> 16:57.609
What's going on here?

16:58.945 --> 16:59.879
Our sacrifice has escaped.

16:59.912 --> 17:01.146
What sacrifice?

17:01.881 --> 17:02.715
Kapu.

18:23.796 --> 18:25.732
Why did they choose him?

18:25.765 --> 18:28.901
They claimed he stole from
them, but it's not true.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.818
If Kanoa and Alika get their way

18:45.852 --> 18:48.921
he will be drowned
or sacrificed.

18:48.955 --> 18:52.424
I thought they abandoned
the sacrifice of humans?

18:52.457 --> 18:54.961
We did, but Alika
and Kanoa wish

18:54.994 --> 18:56.929
to return to the
ways of the past.

19:13.378 --> 19:14.546
This is madness.

19:15.681 --> 19:16.515
Mary!

19:22.021 --> 19:25.457
Mary, Mary where are you going?

19:25.490 --> 19:26.759
Stop, stop!

19:27.894 --> 19:29.394
How could you bring me here?

19:30.763 --> 19:32.832
I mean, you wanted to come.

19:32.865 --> 19:37.469
No, you told me that these
were a peaceful loving people.

19:38.704 --> 19:40.106
Well, I hate them.

19:40.139 --> 19:43.943
I hate every last one of these
filthy, worthless savages!

19:43.976 --> 19:45.778
Mary, please.

19:47.445 --> 19:50.448
Your words are
accountable to God.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.551
These filthy, worthless
savages they are

19:52.584 --> 19:54.452
God's creation just like us.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.388
They have a soul just like us.

19:57.522 --> 19:59.692
Why should I care
what God thinks?

20:00.559 --> 20:01.994
God cares nothing for me.

20:02.028 --> 20:04.897
If he cared one wit about
my welfare I would be

20:04.931 --> 20:08.366
in Boston instead of on
this wretched island.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.569
You brought me to this
god forsaken land,

20:10.602 --> 20:12.071
half a world away
from everything

20:12.104 --> 20:13.806
and everyone I have ever loved

20:13.840 --> 20:15.842
and you expect me to be gracious

20:15.875 --> 20:17.844
as they prepare to
sacrifice a man!

20:19.679 --> 20:22.447
How are you going
to share your faith

20:22.480 --> 20:23.716
when you despise them?

20:27.887 --> 20:30.890
If you think that
they want your faith

20:30.923 --> 20:33.391
then you are a fool, Henry.

20:33.425 --> 20:35.962
They want nothing from
you and yet you continue

20:35.995 --> 20:38.764
to try ingratiate
yourself with them.

20:38.798 --> 20:40.565
What is it that you want?

20:40.599 --> 20:43.468
Maybe you'd like one of these
Hawaiian women for yourself?

20:44.737 --> 20:45.537
Oh, my god.

20:46.873 --> 20:48.708
I'm so sorry, Mary.

20:48.741 --> 20:49.541
Please.

20:51.177 --> 20:52.444
God, what have I done?

20:53.813 --> 20:54.814
I hate you.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.917
I curse the day that we met.

20:59.584 --> 21:01.754
You will never lay
a hand on me again.

21:02.788 --> 21:03.789
Mary.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.902
Be careful, Chiefess.

21:15.935 --> 21:16.836
What do you mean?

21:16.869 --> 21:19.672
We don't know what
their intentions are.

21:19.705 --> 21:22.875
They have come to Japan
to force us to trade.

21:22.909 --> 21:24.076
We refused.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.510
And?

21:25.543 --> 21:27.847
They threatened to
take over our country.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.881
Be careful.

21:47.967 --> 21:51.503
Well, how are you on this
fine evening, good sir?

21:53.139 --> 21:54.506
May I help you gentlemen?

21:54.539 --> 21:55.841
Gentlemen!

21:57.143 --> 21:59.912
No gents here, just
us boozing, whoring,

21:59.946 --> 22:02.580
good for nothing
sinners, right preacher?

22:03.683 --> 22:05.051
I'm not here to judge you.

22:05.084 --> 22:06.852
Oh you're not?

22:06.886 --> 22:08.821
What if I did this, huh?

22:08.854 --> 22:10.022
Huh!

22:10.056 --> 22:12.858
Am I a sinner now, huh?

22:12.892 --> 22:13.926
Am I a sinner now?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.628
Stop it.

22:15.661 --> 22:17.797
Stay out of this, old man.

22:17.830 --> 22:18.831
This doesn't concern you.

22:18.864 --> 22:20.532
I said, that's enough.

22:30.042 --> 22:32.278
What, who are you?

22:32.311 --> 22:33.511
Go in peace.

22:34.847 --> 22:36.548
Boys, let's go.

22:38.017 --> 22:39.085
Let's get out of here, come on.

22:43.089 --> 22:45.725
You are not well
received, Mr. Bingham.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.729
I guess not.

22:49.762 --> 22:51.831
So, why are you here?

22:58.037 --> 22:59.705
To tell people about God.

23:00.740 --> 23:05.111
I can't believe you travel
this long a journey for that.

23:05.144 --> 23:07.579
There must be another reason.

23:07.612 --> 23:08.981
Like what?

23:09.015 --> 23:11.817
Like you want to force these
people to trade with you.

23:13.285 --> 23:17.089
I assure you, I have
no such intentions.

23:17.123 --> 23:19.225
Americans came to
Japan to force us

23:19.258 --> 23:21.894
to trade with you, remember?

23:21.927 --> 23:23.262
That's not why I'm here.

23:24.997 --> 23:27.800
I'm here for something
more valuable.

23:29.101 --> 23:34.106
And what is that?

23:35.841 --> 23:36.909
I'm hoping to find out.

23:39.178 --> 23:40.012
Excuse me.

24:04.403 --> 24:05.571
Let's go.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.366
I can't take this....

24:10.033 --> 24:11.034
I did nothing wrong

24:13.287 --> 24:15.038
What a coward

24:15.998 --> 24:18.316
You're such a great warrior

24:21.044 --> 24:22.045
Kapu

24:22.880 --> 24:25.465
You should be honored to
sacrifice yourself

24:31.555 --> 24:32.556
Stop crying!

24:33.140 --> 24:34.308
You filthy coward!

24:34.641 --> 24:36.268
I don't deserve to die!

24:51.917 --> 24:53.752
Oh that poor man.

24:57.890 --> 24:59.325
Chiefess, can't
you do something?

25:11.370 --> 25:13.639
I don't agree with
this, Mrs. Thornton.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.409
But I cannot go against
what the priestesses say

25:17.443 --> 25:18.744
in regards to Pele.

25:19.879 --> 25:21.180
There must be a sacrifice.

25:32.458 --> 25:33.959
But aren't you their leader?

25:35.194 --> 25:38.264
What would happen if they were
not to go through with this?

25:38.297 --> 25:42.801
The volcano might erupt and
completely cover this island.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.904
You truly believe that?

25:44.937 --> 25:49.008
Pele was exiled by her
father because of her anger.

25:49.041 --> 25:51.844
The last straw was between
her and her sister.

25:51.877 --> 25:54.847
Namakaokahai who's
husband Pele had seduced.

25:56.081 --> 25:57.883
Pagan barbarism!

26:08.928 --> 26:10.229
Hiram!

26:10.262 --> 26:11.697
Hiram, what happened?

26:12.331 --> 26:13.766
Nothing, I'm okay.

26:15.034 --> 26:16.335
Did someone attack you?

26:17.269 --> 26:18.103
Yes.

26:18.137 --> 26:19.438
Who?

26:19.471 --> 26:20.906
Who did this to you?

26:21.907 --> 26:22.942
The sailors.

26:24.977 --> 26:27.947
Why does God allow all
of these worthless beasts

26:27.980 --> 26:29.181
to roam the earth?

26:29.215 --> 26:32.384
Mary, we must
love our enemies.

26:33.285 --> 26:36.522
And even pray for those
that persecute us.

26:36.555 --> 26:40.960
Otherwise, what difference
is there between us and them?

26:42.027 --> 26:43.495
Sometimes it is not possible

26:43.529 --> 26:45.931
or practical to
live out God's word.

26:47.833 --> 26:50.869
Mary, keep the faith, Mary.

26:55.441 --> 26:58.210
I have
known Kapu for many years.

26:58.244 --> 26:59.445
He was a good man.

27:00.813 --> 27:03.115
He does not deserve
to die like this.

27:04.316 --> 27:06.252
I watched them put
him on the altar.

27:07.186 --> 27:09.021
I became filled with rage.

27:10.456 --> 27:13.993
What god requires a man to
die for it's appeasement

27:14.026 --> 27:15.861
and if it isn't
appeased will erupt

27:15.894 --> 27:17.997
and destroy more innocent lives?

27:18.732 --> 27:20.933
These foreigners
speak of a just god.

27:21.867 --> 27:22.935
Who is right?

27:42.913 --> 27:46.959
It is a great honor to die
for your god, Kapu.

27:49.378 --> 27:51.964
Pele will be appeased.

27:52.339 --> 27:55.551
Your spirit will be released
so you can be free!

27:58.595 --> 28:00.556
With the sword of Captain Cook

28:01.723 --> 28:05.060
Goddess, we offer this sacrifice to you.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.788
It is a great day!

28:25.122 --> 28:28.250
Pele has been appeased.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.171
What is the matter with all of you?

28:32.671 --> 28:34.798
We are saved!

28:38.243 --> 28:39.945
I know that is wrong.

28:39.978 --> 28:41.013
It is.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.950
I knew Kapu, he
is not a bad man.

28:47.052 --> 28:48.120
I'm sure he wasn't.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.317
Take him to the volcano

28:53.358 --> 28:54.902
as a sacrifice to Pele

28:55.694 --> 28:57.112
And throw him in.

29:06.305 --> 29:07.606
Mary, are you all right?

29:12.010 --> 29:16.548
Mary, please, talk to me.

29:17.950 --> 29:20.085
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:21.453 --> 29:23.989
They sacrificed a human
life just to appease

29:24.022 --> 29:25.023
some pagan god.

29:26.959 --> 29:29.595
Henry, please take me back home.

29:29.629 --> 29:30.764
I don't want to stay here.

29:30.797 --> 29:33.966
We don't belong here, for the
love of God, Henry please.

29:33.999 --> 29:36.235
I should
have said something.

29:36.268 --> 29:39.672
No, no, we can't.

29:39.706 --> 29:42.675
This is their land, not ours.

29:44.510 --> 29:47.346
We can't forget that.

29:47.379 --> 29:49.148
We can't forget that.

30:07.533 --> 30:08.567
And so two months went by

30:08.600 --> 30:12.104
and we watched these
missionaries from a distance.

30:12.137 --> 30:13.972
Unsure of what to make of them.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.975
They continued to persevere.

30:56.816 --> 31:00.753
Meanwhile, the foreign woman
becomes more frail by the day.

31:00.787 --> 31:03.155
I fear she may not
live much longer she

31:03.188 --> 31:04.990
is so weak and fearful.

31:05.991 --> 31:10.996
Mary, I may never have
said this to you before.

31:14.299 --> 31:15.133
I love you.

31:19.739 --> 31:22.709
I'm so sorry for what
you had to go through

31:22.742 --> 31:23.776
while you're here.

31:29.147 --> 31:33.085
I promise to have you
on the first boat home.

31:35.387 --> 31:36.622
You have my word on this.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.361
I promise, Mary.

32:02.114 --> 32:02.715
Woo!

32:10.657 --> 32:12.324
That was incredible.

32:13.492 --> 32:15.561
You did pretty good
for your first time.

32:16.696 --> 32:17.730
Thank you.

32:20.733 --> 32:22.735
Do you have any
children, Mr. Bingham?

32:27.840 --> 32:28.675
I did.

32:33.211 --> 32:35.447
But my son passed.

32:39.151 --> 32:41.119
And shortly afterwards
my wife died.

32:44.724 --> 32:46.091
We're sorry, Mr. Bingham.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.294
How you overcome such a loss?

32:51.396 --> 32:54.801
God, he helped me through it.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.604
Is the woman doing OK?

33:00.707 --> 33:02.709
She's not adjusting
well, unfortunately.

33:05.510 --> 33:07.613
Is there anything
we can do to help her?

33:08.781 --> 33:10.783
I don't know what
to do, honestly.

33:12.517 --> 33:15.621
Except pray.

33:15.655 --> 33:18.523
You pray, to god?

33:21.661 --> 33:22.494
Yes.

33:43.215 --> 33:45.384
Are you all right, dear?

33:50.857 --> 33:52.692
We're going to
die here, Henry.

33:52.725 --> 33:53.793
No, God will protect us.

33:54.961 --> 33:58.397
If there is a
god, he's not here.

33:59.264 --> 34:00.265
We need to go home.

34:05.004 --> 34:07.372
I will take care of you.

34:14.914 --> 34:17.784
Get me off this savage island.

34:22.688 --> 34:24.757
I made a promise to you

34:24.791 --> 34:27.694
and I'll have you on
the next boat home.

34:29.795 --> 34:34.331
And I'll be with you, I promise.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.402
I'll never leave
your side, I promise.

34:49.347 --> 34:50.614
God help me!

34:54.954 --> 34:56.989
Help me know what
you want me to do.

34:59.926 --> 35:04.229
Oh, I've utterly
failed in everyway.

35:06.899 --> 35:08.935
My wife despises me, Lord.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.270
She'll never forgive me.

35:15.074 --> 35:19.444
God, did you just send
all of us here to die?

35:20.947 --> 35:23.716
It seems neither of
us can sleep tonight.

35:23.750 --> 35:28.654
Uh, no, it's true, it's true.

35:30.957 --> 35:32.024
How is your wife?

35:34.060 --> 35:34.894
She's not well.

35:37.329 --> 35:38.664
I'm afraid she's not well.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.001
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:43.335 --> 35:44.469
Is there anything I can do?

35:44.503 --> 35:48.941
No, no she's being
ferociously attacked by

35:49.809 --> 35:51.510
a terrible, terrible enemy.

35:53.846 --> 35:55.313
Enemy?

35:55.347 --> 35:55.982
Yes.

35:56.015 --> 35:56.816
What enemy?

35:58.517 --> 36:01.419
Satan, the devil.

36:01.453 --> 36:06.058
Ah, yes, the enemy of all.

36:07.392 --> 36:08.393
Tell me something.

36:09.528 --> 36:12.799
Why does our god
require a sacrifice

36:12.832 --> 36:14.332
and yours does not?

36:14.366 --> 36:15.902
There was a human sacrifice

36:15.935 --> 36:18.570
and his name was Jesus Christ.

36:19.639 --> 36:24.543
Wait a minute, you said
this Jesus was God's son.

36:24.576 --> 36:26.879
How did he become
a human sacrifice?

36:26.913 --> 36:28.380
For what reason?

36:28.413 --> 36:32.384
He let himself be killed
as a final sacrifice

36:32.417 --> 36:35.755
to appease the wrath of
God for all of our sins.

36:37.790 --> 36:39.659
Now I'm really confused.

36:40.860 --> 36:44.130
You and Hiram spoke
of this god of love

36:44.163 --> 36:46.565
now he is a god of wrath?

36:46.598 --> 36:48.100
Which one is it?

36:48.134 --> 36:49.969
It's hard to believe in a god

36:50.002 --> 36:53.072
that could have so many
facets to his personality

36:53.105 --> 36:55.808
that he could love his
children, bring the grace

36:55.842 --> 36:57.877
of forgiveness to
the whole world,

36:59.745 --> 37:02.915
and still have such anger against
those who sin against him.

37:05.084 --> 37:09.121
But why would God want
to sacrifice his only son?

37:09.155 --> 37:11.791
Why not an evil person
who deserves it?

37:11.824 --> 37:15.127
Because it was a
perfect sacrifice.

37:17.163 --> 37:20.365
The only acceptable
sacrifice to God.

37:22.168 --> 37:26.371
A god who sacrifices
himself for humans.

37:27.106 --> 37:28.473
That intrigues me.

37:30.475 --> 37:32.678
Have a good night, Mr. Thornton.

37:33.946 --> 37:36.716
Good night, your highness.

37:36.749 --> 37:37.850
Good night, Chiefess.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.937
Father God, please help us.

37:59.105 --> 38:01.741
We came to bring the
good news about your son

38:01.774 --> 38:04.877
to these people but it's been
anything but good for us.

38:10.016 --> 38:12.484
Please dear God, bless my wife.

38:14.552 --> 38:18.024
Help her recover,
if it is your will.

38:22.494 --> 38:23.829
Please dear God.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.702
If it is your will.

38:35.641 --> 38:36.242
The next ship arrives

38:36.275 --> 38:37.843
in less than two weeks.

38:37.877 --> 38:39.178
The missionaries have now been

38:39.211 --> 38:41.814
on our island for three months.

38:41.847 --> 38:44.183
The woman missionary
is doing poorly.

38:44.216 --> 38:48.854
We offered her meat, poi, but
she cannot eat what we eat.

38:48.888 --> 38:51.891
Perhaps their holiday celebration
will lift her spirits.

38:55.695 --> 38:57.129
For you.

38:57.163 --> 39:00.532
Would love to,
thank you, thank you.

39:04.904 --> 39:06.872
Very good, mahalo.

39:06.906 --> 39:07.907
You're welcome.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.175
Mahalo, mahalo.

39:30.329 --> 39:35.876
Chiefess, I understand they will
all leave on the next ship.

39:36.877 --> 39:39.630
Mr. Thornton and his wife will leave,

39:40.172 --> 39:42.257
but Mr. Bingham will stay.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.760
They must all be gone.

39:45.135 --> 39:47.679
I’m the Chiefess of this tribe.

39:48.472 --> 39:51.892
It’s by my orders who may
stay and who must leave.

39:52.976 --> 39:55.229
They are a danger to our tribe.

39:56.021 --> 39:57.314
Like Cook they will attempt

39:57.564 --> 40:00.567
to make everyone forget our gods.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.362
They’re infidels.

40:03.612 --> 40:04.613
How?

40:05.155 --> 40:08.784
They must all be aboard
the next ship.

40:17.643 --> 40:19.211
Kanoa has the entire islands

40:19.245 --> 40:20.612
in the grip of fear.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.682
No one wishes to listen.

40:23.716 --> 40:25.051
Even to possible truth.

40:32.925 --> 40:34.760
Look at all of them.

40:34.794 --> 40:36.929
Look at all the stars.

40:38.664 --> 40:39.597
How many are there?

40:40.666 --> 40:41.267
A billion?

40:43.636 --> 40:44.569
A trillion?

40:46.839 --> 40:49.875
We come here, some of us
away from our families

40:49.909 --> 40:50.843
and our homes.

40:55.347 --> 40:57.883
But to spend
Christmas with others

41:00.386 --> 41:05.324
and any sacrifice for
the sake of Jesus Christ

41:07.927 --> 41:11.831
is rewarded much more.

41:13.899 --> 41:16.735
Reverend Henry, Makana to you.

41:18.037 --> 41:18.871
Merry Christmas.

41:20.106 --> 41:21.407
Oh, thank you, Makana.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.842
And merry Christmas for you.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.911
May I join you guys?

41:26.712 --> 41:29.715
Yes please, it's so
nice to see you came.

41:29.748 --> 41:30.950
Akira, yes?

41:35.121 --> 41:37.156
Can we sing "Silent
Night" for you?

41:37.189 --> 41:38.290
Yes, please.

41:39.859 --> 41:41.827
Bless us with your
beautiful voices, young men.

41:42.928 --> 41:43.929
Ready?

41:53.339 --> 41:58.310

Let's sing it again.

42:40.219 --> 42:45.224
♪ Silent night, holy night ♪

42:54.491 --> 42:56.743
The leaders were looking for you.

42:57.828 --> 43:00.789
I was at gathering with
the missionaries.

43:02.165 --> 43:04.543
I don’t understand...

43:05.127 --> 43:07.629
It was unlike anything....

43:08.380 --> 43:10.507
I’ve ever heard...

43:11.008 --> 43:12.551
What happened?

43:13.719 --> 43:14.803
I felt....

43:15.429 --> 43:16.430
Peace

43:17.639 --> 43:18.640
Love

43:19.558 --> 43:20.559
Joy.

43:22.728 --> 43:24.104
What are you saying?

43:24.855 --> 43:25.856
You’re not...

43:27.649 --> 43:28.650
What if...

43:29.693 --> 43:31.236
it really is true?

43:31.570 --> 43:33.071
This God took the form

43:33.113 --> 43:34.781
of a human being and sacrificed
Himself

43:35.032 --> 43:36.825
for the redemption of the entire
world...

43:37.868 --> 43:40.537
That is unfathomable.

43:43.081 --> 43:48.629
Our villager Opukaha’ia believed.

43:49.588 --> 43:53.467
He wrote about this Jesus.

43:54.218 --> 43:58.096
But I didn’t understand.

44:11.068 --> 44:14.905
Chiefess, there will be another
sacrifice in three days.

44:15.989 --> 44:17.324
Who?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.451
Makana

44:21.203 --> 44:22.454
Makana

44:23.664 --> 44:24.665
Are you kidding?

44:25.290 --> 44:28.544
No. We must end this.

44:29.503 --> 44:31.380
We cannot Chiefess.

44:31.922 --> 44:33.674
The god Ku demands it.

44:34.299 --> 44:38.428
Do you have no regard for
our King Kamehameha II?

44:39.096 --> 44:41.807
He commanded the end of
human sacrificing.

44:42.516 --> 44:44.643
He ended sacrifice because
of the foreign man

44:45.394 --> 44:49.064
Captain Cook and the British
sailors who wanted our goods.

44:49.773 --> 44:53.861
You want us to stop worshipping
our god?

44:54.778 --> 44:59.616
What if our god is not
what we think he is?

45:00.284 --> 45:02.911
What if there is another path?

45:04.037 --> 45:09.126
You are allowing the foreign man’s
beliefs to infiltrate your mind.

45:09.585 --> 45:13.380
What kind of god requires
a human sacrifice?

45:14.089 --> 45:15.966
Makana is a good man and

45:16.675 --> 45:19.511
we’re going to kill him
because Kanoa commands it?

45:20.137 --> 45:22.723
She is only a woman.

45:23.140 --> 45:24.391
Only a woman?

45:24.975 --> 45:27.269
Kanoa is very powerful.

45:27.769 --> 45:29.479
Do not cross her.

45:29.813 --> 45:32.191
The decision is made.

45:33.066 --> 45:36.486
He will be sacrificed.

45:52.878 --> 45:54.129
God...please...

45:54.505 --> 45:55.923
if you are out there....
I want to know the truth.

46:03.013 --> 46:06.350
Who are you?
Who are you really?

46:09.186 --> 46:10.979
Please show me the truth...

46:11.021 --> 46:13.232
I NEED to know!!
I cannot go on like this!

46:17.035 --> 46:19.037
If you exist, show me!

46:22.341 --> 46:23.175
Show me!

46:32.484 --> 46:37.089
Mary, Mary this is the freshest
food you will ever find.

46:37.990 --> 46:39.992
Much fresher than in Boston.

46:43.028 --> 46:45.297
And look here, they were just.

46:45.330 --> 46:46.465
They gave you a gift.

46:55.174 --> 46:59.044
I'm so sorry what you're
going through here.

47:05.117 --> 47:06.218
Merry Christmas, Mary.

47:09.021 --> 47:09.689
Merry Christmas.

47:35.782 --> 47:38.450
Is she okay, Hiram?

47:38.484 --> 47:41.053
She's suffering from
some sort of break down.

47:41.821 --> 47:43.656
I don't know what
to do, honestly.

47:45.825 --> 47:47.125
Henry is with her now.

47:48.460 --> 47:50.763
Well, what about prayer?

47:54.333 --> 47:55.167
Yes.

47:57.536 --> 47:58.370
Prayer.

48:01.406 --> 48:02.574
Deep prayer.

48:08.146 --> 48:12.451
He who dwells in the
secret place of the most high

48:12.484 --> 48:14.754
shall abide under the
shadow of the almighty.

48:16.488 --> 48:19.157
I will say of the
Lord, he is my refuge

48:19.191 --> 48:22.494
and my fortress, my God.

48:23.830 --> 48:25.130
In him I will trust.

48:26.799 --> 48:28.735
Surely he shall deliver
you from the snare

48:28.768 --> 48:31.403
of the foul and from
the perilous pestilence.

48:32.604 --> 48:34.674
He shall cover you
with his feathers

48:35.842 --> 48:38.544
and under his wings
you shall take refuge.

48:39.812 --> 48:43.783
His truth shall be your
shield and buckler.

48:44.751 --> 48:48.655
You shall not be afraid
of the terror by night

48:48.688 --> 48:52.057
nor of the arrow
that flies by day.

48:52.992 --> 48:56.194
Nor of the pestilence
that walks in darkness.

48:57.563 --> 49:01.066
Nor of the destruction that
lays waste at noon day.

49:02.200 --> 49:07.406
A 1,000 may fall at your side
and 10,000 at your right hand

49:09.575 --> 49:11.443
but it shall not come near you.

49:12.912 --> 49:15.080
Only with your
eyes shall you look

49:15.748 --> 49:17.717
and see the reward of the wicked

49:18.718 --> 49:23.856
because you have made the
Lord who is my refuge,

49:24.657 --> 49:27.827
even the most high,
your dwelling place.

49:27.860 --> 49:30.228
No evil shall befall you.

49:32.531 --> 49:35.100
No evil shall befall you.

49:36.803 --> 49:41.373
No evil shall befall you.

49:45.652 --> 49:47.821
Did you want to see me?

49:48.822 --> 49:51.366
I have heard some
distressing news.

49:53.744 --> 49:54.870
What?

49:57.456 --> 50:00.959
Has Chiefess Kapiolani
accepted this new God?

50:01.919 --> 50:03.212
I don’t know the answer
to that question.

50:04.296 --> 50:05.547
Don’t lie to me!

50:05.839 --> 50:07.758
Pele punishes ALL liars!

50:09.676 --> 50:15.807
She loves and respects
Pele, you know that.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.393
We will get it out of her.

50:19.228 --> 50:22.731
Pray to Pele it’s not true.

50:23.690 --> 50:26.610
Gather the elders and
other priestesses.

50:41.968 --> 50:43.268
Henry.

51:17.502 --> 51:19.337
Heave, heave, heave!

51:23.275 --> 51:26.344
Heave, give it all
you've got, heave!

51:28.380 --> 51:29.581
Heave!

51:34.887 --> 51:37.757
Give it all you've
got, heave, heave!

51:40.893 --> 51:42.461
Come on, come on.

52:02.048 --> 52:04.583
I'm so happy you survived.

52:08.955 --> 52:11.490
Mary, Mary are you okay?

52:11.523 --> 52:12.324
Yes.

52:12.357 --> 52:13.059
Huh?

52:13.092 --> 52:14.827
I'm just glad he survived.

52:14.861 --> 52:15.862
Oh me too, me too.

52:19.464 --> 52:20.565
I'm so sorry.

52:20.599 --> 52:22.735
I've behaved so terribly.

52:22.769 --> 52:24.469
I made a fool of myself
and I brought shame

52:24.503 --> 52:25.504
on our entire group.

52:25.537 --> 52:26.438
No, you didn't, Mary.

52:26.471 --> 52:27.372
I can see it in their eyes.

52:27.405 --> 52:28.841
You were so brave to come here

52:28.875 --> 52:29.642
in the first place.

52:29.675 --> 52:32.712
I should have seen,
before we came,

52:32.745 --> 52:35.681
how difficult it
would be here for you.

52:35.715 --> 52:39.484
Oh Mary, I'm so proud.

52:39.518 --> 52:40.987
I'm so proud of you.

52:44.957 --> 52:47.425
Thank you, thank you.

53:00.807 --> 53:04.110
And just like
that Mary became a new person.

53:04.143 --> 53:07.079
The heavy veil of
oppression lifted from her.

53:07.113 --> 53:09.949
It was the beginning
of a new day.

53:25.031 --> 53:26.933
So beautiful.

53:28.768 --> 53:30.937
Yes, it is so beautiful.

53:31.838 --> 53:34.006
I was talking about you.

53:35.074 --> 53:36.075
Me, Henry.

53:38.811 --> 53:40.847
You find me beautiful?

53:41.781 --> 53:43.816
Yes.

54:02.367 --> 54:03.785
Stay strong my brothers.

54:06.413 --> 54:10.334
Our god demands a sacrifice...

54:12.211 --> 54:14.338
we’ve picked a man

54:16.465 --> 54:19.259
This man fulfills the
requirements of Pele.

54:22.763 --> 54:24.765
We have picked Makana.

54:26.192 --> 54:27.693
What's going on?

54:29.161 --> 54:31.998
They are sacrificing
another of us.

54:32.031 --> 54:33.531
Again?

54:33.565 --> 54:34.399
Who?

54:35.567 --> 54:36.568
Makana.

54:38.871 --> 54:40.006
Why?

54:40.039 --> 54:43.042
Because his father
was an enemy of our king.

54:46.212 --> 54:47.847
God give us strength.

54:48.163 --> 54:54.294
I’m sorry brother.
You have been chosen.

54:54.628 --> 54:56.338
Your father served King Kalikele
and therefore was an enemy

54:56.672 --> 54:58.131
You would have me pay
for the sins of my father?

54:58.507 --> 54:59.508
I’m sorry.

54:59.842 --> 55:01.552
You will be sacrificed
tomorrow morning

55:01.885 --> 55:03.762
to Ku and Pele.

55:04.263 --> 55:05.472
This is madness.

55:06.306 --> 55:08.600
Utter madness!

55:28.154 --> 55:29.255
Hiram, what's wrong?

55:29.288 --> 55:30.056
They're sacrificing again.

55:30.089 --> 55:30.890
A human?

55:30.923 --> 55:32.692
Yes, Makana.

55:32.725 --> 55:34.660
Not Makana, this can't be.

55:34.694 --> 55:35.795
We have to stop this.

55:35.828 --> 55:37.495
I don't know how we can.

55:40.674 --> 55:42.676
I pity you Makana.

55:46.763 --> 55:49.808
You should have gone
like a man.

55:59.885 --> 56:01.854
Henry always says
that we shouldn't interfere.

56:01.887 --> 56:03.823
Look what good
that did last time.

56:03.856 --> 56:04.924
I'm not gonna stand by and watch

56:04.957 --> 56:06.759
an innocent man be put to death.

56:06.792 --> 56:08.627
It's only one of you, Hiram,

56:08.661 --> 56:11.230
with no weapons against
all of these warriors.

56:11.263 --> 56:12.298
I'm sorry, Mary.

56:12.331 --> 56:13.833
I have to try.

56:13.866 --> 56:16.635
Makana is my friend, my brother!

56:16.669 --> 56:17.870
He's our friend, too

56:17.903 --> 56:19.905
but I'm afraid there's
nothing you can do.

56:19.939 --> 56:20.773
I'm sorry, Mary.

56:20.806 --> 56:21.974
I have to try.

56:38.315 --> 56:43.779
The gods are not happy.

57:07.761 --> 57:09.096
Let him go.

57:12.391 --> 57:13.767
We captured him.

57:15.686 --> 57:17.062
He will be sacrificed.

57:17.604 --> 57:20.649
You do not lead this tribe,
Alika.

57:22.526 --> 57:26.530
I answer to Pele and Ku.

57:27.322 --> 57:28.323
They require a human sacrifice.

57:28.365 --> 57:29.491
Kanoa said-

57:30.450 --> 57:32.870
-Kanoa does not lead our tribe.

57:33.954 --> 57:37.708
I will not tolerate our
gods being defiled.

57:39.376 --> 57:41.753
Our entire village could die

57:42.421 --> 57:44.673
if we do not appease them.

57:46.049 --> 57:47.050
Look up

57:48.010 --> 57:49.720
the volcano is already angry.

57:51.889 --> 57:55.058
I am trying to save our
village from destruction.

57:55.601 --> 57:56.727
If you care about your people,

57:57.394 --> 57:59.188
you will hold your tongue
against me

58:07.880 --> 58:09.949
Are you gonna let
them sacrifice Makana?

58:09.982 --> 58:12.218
What choice do I
have, Mr. Bingham?

58:12.251 --> 58:14.153
I cannot go against
what Pele asks.

58:15.287 --> 58:17.656
Tell them to stop.

58:17.690 --> 58:19.125
But it is up to the gods.

58:55.577 --> 58:56.954
Alika says ‘no one’ may enter.

58:57.329 --> 58:58.747
Under strict orders

59:00.082 --> 59:01.416
I am your Chiefess

59:02.042 --> 59:03.752
I command you let him in.

59:06.739 --> 59:07.439
Be quick, Hiram.

59:08.307 --> 59:09.842
Yes, Chiefess.

59:24.323 --> 59:25.891
How are you Makana, my brother?

59:35.367 --> 59:38.137
I'm so sorry for the trouble
we got you in, my friend.

59:39.338 --> 59:40.839
I am to die tomorrow.

59:43.475 --> 59:46.745
I need to know the
truth about your god.

59:46.779 --> 59:47.846
He's not my god.

59:48.847 --> 59:50.082
He's everyone's god.

59:51.050 --> 59:52.751
He can be your god too.

59:53.886 --> 59:55.120
It's too late now.

59:56.055 --> 59:57.189
It's never too late.

59:58.991 --> 01:00:00.893
As long as there is
breath in your body

01:00:00.926 --> 01:00:02.795
the Bible says he who
calls upon the Lord

01:00:02.828 --> 01:00:03.829
will be saved.

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:05.831
Is it possible?

01:00:05.864 --> 01:00:06.899
Yes.

01:00:09.368 --> 01:00:10.869
It is a wonderful
thing for a god

01:00:10.903 --> 01:00:12.504
to sacrifice himself for us.

01:00:15.841 --> 01:00:20.846
Brother Hiram, please,
my wife and children.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.949
Make sure they are
taken care of, please.

01:00:27.953 --> 01:00:30.990
Yes, of course I will.

01:00:33.092 --> 01:00:35.894
What I wouldn't give
to go surfing again.

01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:52.778
It is time, Makana!

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:07.376
What is this?

01:01:08.377 --> 01:01:10.128
Where is Makana?

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:12.164
I am taking his place.

01:01:17.536 --> 01:01:20.472
I said, I am taking his place.

01:01:20.506 --> 01:01:22.308
You can sacrifice me instead.

01:02:14.426 --> 01:02:17.196
Why is Hiram with them?

01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:18.931
He must have done
something wrong.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.968
Hiram,
what are you doing?

01:02:23.001 --> 01:02:24.036
What is going on?

01:02:26.372 --> 01:02:28.073
What's going on?

01:02:28.107 --> 01:02:29.208
Stay back!

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:31.960
Alika!

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:33.921
Don't do this

01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:35.380
GET OUT!

01:02:35.381 --> 01:02:37.249
Why are you
holding Mr. Bingham?

01:02:39.251 --> 01:02:41.353
He said he would
be sacrificed.

01:02:41.387 --> 01:02:42.254
What?

01:02:42.287 --> 01:02:44.356
What, no!

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:47.627
I don't have a
family, Makana does.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:48.728
Hiram, this is not our affair!

01:02:48.762 --> 01:02:52.097
Hiram this is
madness, please tell them no.

Please, don't!

01:04:28.577 --> 01:04:29.578
What are you doing?

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.580
We cannot wait another minute!

01:04:31.731 --> 01:04:33.398
Henry, do something!

01:04:33.432 --> 01:04:34.883
Chiefess, please.

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:36.960
He must be sacrificed!

01:04:41.924 --> 01:04:42.925
STOP!

01:04:44.092 --> 01:04:45.969
PUT YOUR KNIFE DOWN!

01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:49.223
I SAID STOP!

01:04:54.228 --> 01:04:55.187
People!

01:04:56.772 --> 01:04:58.315
Listen to me!

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.527
Give me your ears!

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.447
I have been your Chiefess
for two years.

01:05:05.864 --> 01:05:08.200
You know I have served
you faithfully and with integrity.

01:05:09.409 --> 01:05:10.536
Everything I have done

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:17.793
has always been for
the good of the community.

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:27.928
We should never be afraid
of the truth. No matter how it hurts.

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:31.306
I’ve made a decision.

01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:34.643
You no longer have to
worship Pele.

01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:38.146
You have the freedom to
worship

01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:40.232
whomever you choose.

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:42.693
What are you saying?

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.195
You heard me.

01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:47.990
They may choose to worship
whomever they want.

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:50.450
PELE WILL KILL US ALL
FOR YOUR INSOLENT WORDS!

01:05:50.826 --> 01:05:52.661
She will rain fire and
brimstone on us

01:05:52.703 --> 01:05:54.496
How dare you speak
against her

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.832
I believe God is bigger

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.795
You don’t believe in Pele
anymore?

01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:03.714
No.

01:06:05.174 --> 01:06:09.303
Is she not also a foreign
deity from Borabora?

01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:13.432
Chiefess, have you lost
your mind?

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:16.351
You are still free to worship
your god.

01:06:19.855 --> 01:06:24.484
Prove your God is real.

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:26.862
How?

01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:30.949
Go to the volcano

01:06:31.283 --> 01:06:34.203
and see if Pele will
allow you to live.

01:06:40.727 --> 01:06:44.664
I shall do that tomorrow,
when the sun rises.

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:49.736
In the meantime, release
Mr. Bingham to me.

01:06:50.903 --> 01:06:52.672
Oh thank
god, thank god.

01:07:03.448 --> 01:07:04.616
Come, come.

01:07:04.651 --> 01:07:07.386
You're safe now,
you're safe now.

01:07:08.855 --> 01:07:11.791
Hiram,
please, please, Hiram.

01:07:20.499 --> 01:07:23.126
Once Kapiolani dies tomorrow
morning

01:07:24.044 --> 01:07:26.421
kill the foreigners

01:07:27.965 --> 01:07:28.966
Which ones?

01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:30.384
All of them.

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:34.888
Let's make sure no one
comes to our island again

01:07:35.973 --> 01:07:37.766
Is this necessary?

01:07:39.434 --> 01:07:44.773
Just send them back
to their country.

01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:49.778
You DARE to challenge me
Alika?

01:07:50.279 --> 01:07:51.905
No

01:07:51.964 --> 01:07:54.366
You are the only one
that wants them dead.

01:07:54.867 --> 01:07:56.994
So what?

01:07:57.369 --> 01:08:00.163
When Kapiolani dies,
I will then become your Chiefess.

01:08:01.373 --> 01:08:04.459
Pele will be merciful to us

01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:06.587
after Kapiolani is gone

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:16.763
You aren’t really doing this
to appease Pele are you?

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.183
What do you mean?

01:08:19.558 --> 01:08:21.393
This is about power.

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:24.645
You want to be the Chiefess.

01:08:25.564 --> 01:08:27.274
Don't you ever speak that
way to me again

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:39.879
You must leave now
before the villagers arise.

01:08:39.912 --> 01:08:41.881
I have a boat waiting
to take you to Oahu.

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:43.348
Why?

01:08:43.381 --> 01:08:45.417
If I do not return
you will be killed.

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:46.551
You will return.

01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:48.487
Either way you should leave.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.691
If we leave now then
our faith means nothing.

01:08:52.992 --> 01:08:56.895
The priestesses,
they're very powerful.

01:08:58.698 --> 01:09:02.835
They may have us killed
before this all plays out.

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:07.807
No one has ever returned
from the volcano.

01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:23.956
Sweetie, that was so
beautiful, you were wonderful.

01:09:24.991 --> 01:09:25.925
Yeah.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:26.926
It's a good boy.

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:27.827
- Come here.
- Good boy.

01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:31.363
Listen, she's arranged for us

01:09:31.395 --> 01:09:33.430
to leave tomorrow
morning on a boat.

01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:34.634
Why?

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:37.602
Because they're gonna kill
us if she does not come back.

01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:38.738
I believe she will return.

01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:41.774
No, I know, but
we can't be certain.

01:09:41.808 --> 01:09:43.709
I'm not concerned about myself

01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:45.544
but I cannot let
anything happen to you.

01:09:45.577 --> 01:09:48.313
I am not afraid to die
as long as I am with you.

01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:49.881
Good, thank god.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:52.885
I know, I know.

01:09:54.586 --> 01:09:56.122
It will be all right,
we're in God's hands.

01:09:56.155 --> 01:09:57.924
Just come with me, come on.

01:09:57.957 --> 01:09:59.491
Okay, come on.

01:10:13.572 --> 01:10:15.641
Jesus, I love you.

01:10:16.876 --> 01:10:19.511
I know you are the son of God.

01:10:19.544 --> 01:10:21.914
I know you are the
savior of the world.

01:10:22.715 --> 01:10:25.685
Please be with me as
I go to the volcano.

01:10:26.618 --> 01:10:31.489
And if I die, I look
forward to seeing you.

01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:43.243
Farewell.

01:10:43.827 --> 01:10:46.496
I am going but I
will be back.

01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:48.957
Don’t be a fool, Chiefess

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:52.836
I'm asking you not
to do this

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.088
We have had our differences

01:10:55.631 --> 01:10:58.425
but I don’t want you to
sacrifice yourself.

01:11:00.052 --> 01:11:02.513
We beg of you

01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:04.598
not to do such a foolish
thing.

01:11:08.101 --> 01:11:09.770
Chiefess, you have been
good to all of us!

01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:13.148
If you do this,
you will never come back.

01:11:14.399 --> 01:11:17.945
What was lost shall be found.

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:21.615
All of the prophecies say
you will die

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:28.664
if you go to the Halema’uma’u
without a sacrifice.

01:11:29.665 --> 01:11:32.459
Then I shall die.

01:11:33.252 --> 01:11:34.670
Shame on you.

01:11:35.337 --> 01:11:38.841
You are an infidel like them.

01:11:39.524 --> 01:11:42.094
No one touches
them while I am gone.

01:11:42.128 --> 01:11:43.629
That is a direct order.

01:11:46.899 --> 01:11:47.867
They will be unharmed.

01:11:48.968 --> 01:11:50.202
But if you do not return

01:11:50.236 --> 01:11:51.904
by the end of the
day, they will die.

01:11:55.074 --> 01:11:56.574
Leave them be.

01:11:57.509 --> 01:11:59.812
Alika, it is me that you want.

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.851
Kapiolani, I am
willing to die today.

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:08.520
We will kill you both!

01:12:12.124 --> 01:12:13.092
Will she be safe?

01:12:13.993 --> 01:12:14.827
Yes.

01:12:17.063 --> 01:12:18.864
Should I accompany her?

01:12:18.898 --> 01:12:19.899
No.

01:12:22.234 --> 01:12:24.904
I have heard that no
one ever comes back alive.

01:12:25.805 --> 01:12:26.973
She's in God's hands now.

01:13:07.046 --> 01:13:08.981
You will stay, why?

01:13:10.716 --> 01:13:12.752
You knew the
consequences if I fail.

01:13:12.785 --> 01:13:13.886
We won't desert you.

01:13:14.787 --> 01:13:16.889
Your faith is our faith.

01:13:16.922 --> 01:13:18.324
You're our sister in Christ.

01:13:18.357 --> 01:13:21.927
We will stand with
you until death.

01:13:23.696 --> 01:13:27.033
You are truly my
brothers and sisters then.

01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:28.300
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:13:28.334 --> 01:13:30.936
Yes, we are one family now.

01:13:33.906 --> 01:13:35.975
Chiefess, please.

01:13:37.877 --> 01:13:38.911
Please forgive me.

01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:43.115
I behaved so despicably
when I first arrived here.

01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:45.284
I treated you with
such contempt.

01:13:47.253 --> 01:13:51.090
I was a poor example of
a Christian and a woman.

01:13:52.725 --> 01:13:54.894
And yet you embraced our faith.

01:13:57.263 --> 01:13:59.899
I know now that I am no
better than anyone here

01:13:59.932 --> 01:14:01.934
on this island and
in fact far worse

01:14:01.967 --> 01:14:04.602
than you with your
extraordinary courage.

01:14:05.838 --> 01:14:08.674
I know you do not have
any reason to forgive me

01:14:08.707 --> 01:14:12.812
but please understand that
my bigotry was only mine.

01:14:12.845 --> 01:14:14.880
It had nothing to do with them.

01:14:14.914 --> 01:14:17.216
Please forgive them,
please forgive all of us.

01:14:19.652 --> 01:14:23.022
Mary, we have
all been lost once.

01:14:23.989 --> 01:14:25.357
But now we are found.

01:14:26.992 --> 01:14:29.261
We are all children of our God.

01:14:30.663 --> 01:14:32.398
Be at peace, my sister.

01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:33.332
I love you.

01:14:33.365 --> 01:14:35.067
I love you, too, courage.

01:15:05.965 --> 01:15:07.900
The Lord is my shepherd

01:15:07.933 --> 01:15:08.834
I shall not want.

01:15:10.136 --> 01:15:13.005
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

01:15:13.772 --> 01:15:16.041
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

01:15:17.309 --> 01:15:19.912
He restoreth my soul.

01:15:19.945 --> 01:15:22.281
He leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness

01:15:22.314 --> 01:15:23.682
for his namesake.

01:15:26.152 --> 01:15:28.954
Ye, though I walk
through the valley

01:15:28.988 --> 01:15:32.892
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil

01:15:32.925 --> 01:15:34.426
for thou art with me.

01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:38.397
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:15:39.999 --> 01:15:41.901
Thou preparest a table before me

01:15:41.934 --> 01:15:43.769
in the presence of my name.

01:15:44.837 --> 01:15:50.042
Thou anointest my head with
oil, my cup runeth over.

01:15:59.318 --> 01:16:02.721
Surely, goodness and
mercy shall follow me all

01:16:02.755 --> 01:16:06.825
the days of my life
and I will dwell

01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:08.194
in the house of the Lord.

01:16:12.865 --> 01:16:14.099
God is with us.

01:16:15.167 --> 01:16:16.702
God be with her.

01:16:24.143 --> 01:16:27.012
Prove yourself, show yourself!

01:16:28.814 --> 01:16:30.783
Prove yourself to me.

01:16:30.816 --> 01:16:32.017
Are you asleep?

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:36.597
Take cover!

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:48.200
Kill them, kill them!

01:16:48.234 --> 01:16:49.501
Kill them all!

01:16:49.535 --> 01:16:51.370
All of them?

01:16:51.403 --> 01:16:53.005
Yes!

01:16:53.038 --> 01:16:56.976
He who dwells in the secret
place of the most high.

01:16:57.009 --> 01:17:01.180
I will sayeth the Lord, he
is my refuge and my strength.

01:17:02.248 --> 01:17:03.515
In him I trust.

01:17:06.485 --> 01:17:10.889
It is unfortunate it
had to come to this.

01:17:10.923 --> 01:17:13.459
You have sung great chords.

01:17:13.492 --> 01:17:15.394
But we must follow orders.

01:17:15.427 --> 01:17:16.829
Prepare to die!

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:33.028
Is she going into the volcano?

01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:36.949
Impossible....

01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:40.285
Are you sure?

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:18.115
She wants all of us to die!

01:19:14.922 --> 01:19:18.091
WAIT! She's coming out!

01:19:24.957 --> 01:19:27.192
She's alive, she's alive.

01:19:28.661 --> 01:19:29.662
She's alive.

01:20:33.693 --> 01:20:34.694
Let them go.

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:41.768
They are free to worship the
volcano god if they choose

01:20:41.801 --> 01:20:44.436
and we are free to
worship our god.

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.473
The truth shall set you free.

01:20:47.506 --> 01:20:49.709
You can worship
any god you choose.

01:20:50.576 --> 01:20:53.278
As for me and my
household, we will serve

01:20:53.312 --> 01:20:54.379
the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:20:59.618 --> 01:21:03.989
There will be no more
killing, no more sacrifices.

01:21:04.724 --> 01:21:06.258
No more religion.

01:21:07.426 --> 01:21:09.294
You are set free
from this bondage.

01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:12.531
No!

01:21:14.767 --> 01:21:15.601
Enough!

01:21:16.502 --> 01:21:17.603
Did you hear?

01:21:17.637 --> 01:21:19.137
There will be no more killing.

01:21:20.572 --> 01:21:24.076
This is our Chiefess and you
will obey her command, go!

01:21:25.745 --> 01:21:26.779
Mahalo.

01:21:34.978 --> 01:21:36.605
I am sorry I misjudged you.

01:21:37.356 --> 01:21:40.484
My allegiance is to Pele

01:21:40.901 --> 01:21:44.404
but perhaps I will consider
your god too

01:21:57.744 --> 01:22:01.714
That was the most courageous
act that I've ever seen.

01:22:03.282 --> 01:22:06.753
It was not my doing,
I was led by God.

01:22:09.454 --> 01:22:10.422
It was a miracle.

01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:13.793
We were afraid you
wouldn't come back.

01:22:15.561 --> 01:22:16.495
I had my doubts.

01:22:17.864 --> 01:22:20.098
It is a cause for celebration.

01:22:52.732 --> 01:22:53.866
Who are you?

01:22:54.834 --> 01:22:58.671
A man, just like you.

01:23:09.181 --> 01:23:11.684
It
was a cause for celebration.

01:23:11.718 --> 01:23:14.821
I felt something on that
mountain I cannot describe.

01:23:15.621 --> 01:23:18.624
A hand of someone
who protected me.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.330
And so it was, I
finally understood what

01:23:25.364 --> 01:23:26.531
the good news meant.

01:23:27.634 --> 01:23:29.869
We found a new freedom
we hadn't known

01:23:29.902 --> 01:23:32.872
and a god who deeply loved us.

01:23:32.905 --> 01:23:34.741
People tell me what
a courageous act

01:23:34.774 --> 01:23:36.709
it was to challenge the volcano

01:23:37.644 --> 01:23:41.613
but it was courage born
from the love of God.

01:23:41.648 --> 01:23:44.784
The love I had been
searching for all my life.
