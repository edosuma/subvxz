00:27.169 --> 00:28.409
Not bad.

00:29.769 --> 00:31.809
You, come with me.

00:45.209 --> 00:47.169
Now jump.

01:04.688 --> 01:06.129
Listen to my voice.

01:08.249 --> 01:10.609
I said...jump.

01:38.769 --> 01:41.129
Death means nothing to you, does it?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.129
You're lucky.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.529
I've always liked modern art.
So uncompromising.

02:35.529 --> 02:38.289
It's a very complex model
of the exact locations -

02:38.289 --> 02:41.809
Of anomaly appearances
throughout recorded history. I know.

02:41.809 --> 02:43.849
Don't touch it.

02:50.609 --> 02:53.369
Ah. Any news of Helen Cutter?

02:53.369 --> 02:55.409
I've started a review of security.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.209
You're sure the intruder
was her doing?

02:58.209 --> 03:01.129
Can anybody else create
an exact replica of a dead man?

03:02.609 --> 03:04.809
Keep everyone on high alert.

03:04.809 --> 03:08.089
If Helen's back,
we should all be very worried.

03:11.489 --> 03:13.529
Mick, I am running out of patience.

03:13.529 --> 03:15.449
I'm this close, Katherine.

03:15.449 --> 03:18.049
I just need something
that nobody could fake.

03:18.049 --> 03:21.489
I can't run a worldwide media story
based on pure speculation.

03:21.489 --> 03:23.209
You do it all the time.

03:24.889 --> 03:27.289
The mammoth on the M25
didn't come to much.

03:27.289 --> 03:30.529
We can say what we like about
footballers and politicians.

03:30.529 --> 03:32.729
But dinosaurs are different.

03:32.729 --> 03:36.529
No-one believes they exist in the
21st century. I don't believe it.

03:36.529 --> 03:38.569
Let me convince you.
One week.

03:39.689 --> 03:42.209
If you've no hard evidence,
clear your desk.

03:42.209 --> 03:43.249
Right.

03:49.409 --> 03:51.729
Miss Lewis...
I just need five minutes.

03:51.729 --> 03:54.009
How did you find out where I live?

03:54.009 --> 03:56.049
Tell me about the ARC and I'll go.

03:56.049 --> 03:57.609
What are you talking about?

03:57.729 --> 03:59.009
The creatures.

03:59.009 --> 04:01.609
Haven't you got a drunken pop star
to harass?

04:01.609 --> 04:04.889
I'm giving you a chance to comment
before I write the story.

04:04.889 --> 04:07.409
Go into print and you'll be
laughed out of town.

04:08.369 --> 04:10.409
Not if I er...have the proof.

04:10.409 --> 04:12.689
But you don't. And you never will.

04:14.289 --> 04:16.649
This is the biggest cover-up
since Roswell.

04:17.689 --> 04:19.449
I'm going to tear the lid off it.

04:21.608 --> 04:24.249
Come near me again
and I'll have you arrested.

04:34.609 --> 04:38.529
So, this contraption is going to seal
the anomalies, is it?

04:39.569 --> 04:41.049
Er...

04:41.049 --> 04:43.009
in theory.

04:43.969 --> 04:45.329
Yeah.

04:46.969 --> 04:50.129
You want a million pounds for
research and development.

04:50.129 --> 04:52.449
I want something more
than theoretical.

04:52.449 --> 04:57.369
You'll get it. In simple terms,
this machine will reverse
the polarity of the anomalies,

04:57.369 --> 04:59.649
so nothing gets in
and nothing gets out.

04:59.649 --> 05:01.609
James...

05:08.849 --> 05:10.809
Are you sure about this?

05:13.009 --> 05:14.969
Pretty sure.

05:25.249 --> 05:26.809
OK. It's in the city.

05:31.089 --> 05:32.969
It's a hospital.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.609
The new anomaly. Perfect.

06:02.169 --> 06:04.889
Get rid of him.
We've got important things to do.

06:18.209 --> 06:21.289
Becker, take your men.
Look for any creature activity.

06:21.289 --> 06:23.089
Come on.

06:25.649 --> 06:27.129
Power cut.

06:33.129 --> 06:35.369
The back-up generator
should kick in now.

06:36.489 --> 06:37.889
I'm having a baby.
When?

06:37.889 --> 06:38.889
Now.

06:49.569 --> 06:51.529
It's come right through the floor.

06:52.849 --> 06:55.489
So...so, if you walked through,

06:55.489 --> 06:57.649
would you keep on falling?

06:57.649 --> 06:59.769
I don't know.

06:59.769 --> 07:05.089
But the anomaly itself wouldn't be
enough to cause a power outage,
so something's come through it.

07:09.889 --> 07:11.849
Abby.

07:20.409 --> 07:22.369
Teeth marks.

07:23.329 --> 07:25.089
Hyperactive mice?

07:32.249 --> 07:34.609
Your Gran embroidered this blanket
for you.

07:36.649 --> 07:38.449
You'll like her. She's...

07:38.449 --> 07:41.449
she's a smart woman,
but she's wrong about your daddy.

07:41.449 --> 07:43.409
He's a good guy, he just...

07:44.489 --> 07:46.809
just needs a little bit of time,
that's all.

08:13.169 --> 08:15.289
It went through a hole in the wall
there.

08:19.449 --> 08:20.809
What did?
I don't know.

08:20.809 --> 08:23.449
A ratty, chipmunk,
beaver kind of thing.

08:25.329 --> 08:26.849
Well, that narrows it down.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.329
Cutter.

08:29.329 --> 08:31.289
We might have a problem.

08:32.649 --> 08:34.808
A...ratty, chipmunk...

08:34.808 --> 08:35.849
Beaver.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.969
..beaver kind of problem.

08:39.529 --> 08:43.649
How did she describe this creature,
apart from the ratty,
chipmunk thing?

08:43.649 --> 08:45.569
Right. Er...about so big.

08:45.569 --> 08:48.449
Protruding teeth, large,
and some claws.

08:48.449 --> 08:50.769
We've had three other
reported sightings.

08:52.369 --> 08:54.449
We've got dozens of them in here.

08:54.449 --> 08:56.969
I need you both to get this place
evacuated now.

08:59.529 --> 09:02.009
Hi. Er...we have to evacuate
the building.

09:02.009 --> 09:06.569
Sarah, if you see this man
within a mile of the ARC,
you've got to let me know.

09:06.569 --> 09:07.689
Why?

09:07.689 --> 09:09.729
He thinks he knows something.

09:09.729 --> 09:11.089
And does he?

09:12.129 --> 09:14.089
Rather a lot, unfortunately.

09:16.649 --> 09:18.609
What do you think about Cutter?

09:18.609 --> 09:20.049
Erm...Cutter?

09:20.049 --> 09:21.449
I think he's a great guy.

09:25.409 --> 09:27.689
Oh. You mean, what do I think?

09:27.689 --> 09:29.129
Cutter.

09:29.129 --> 09:31.209
OK. I think that he is...

09:31.209 --> 09:33.169
pretty hot,

09:33.169 --> 09:34.809
in an emotionally toxic,

09:34.809 --> 09:38.249
don't-come-near-me,
I'm-a-romantic-disaster kind of way.

09:38.249 --> 09:39.849
Just my type, then.

09:39.849 --> 09:42.569
Is there something going on
between you two?

09:42.569 --> 09:44.329
It's complicated.

09:48.529 --> 09:51.729
Apparently, he used to like
some girl that looked like me.

09:51.729 --> 09:53.729
According to him, actually was me,

09:53.729 --> 09:56.129
in a different evolutionary
timeline.

09:56.129 --> 09:59.769
So, now I don't know if he likes her
or me or the version of her in me,

09:59.769 --> 10:01.689
or whether
it's just the same thing.

10:02.609 --> 10:04.329
No baggage, then?

10:08.649 --> 10:14.209
They're on red alert. Infiltration
is impossible without security
clearance and retina scanners.

10:14.209 --> 10:16.169
That depends on who you know.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.922
Sh!
What?

10:30.922 --> 10:32.202
Sh!

10:41.802 --> 10:43.802
What is it?

10:43.802 --> 10:45.802
A diictodon.

10:45.802 --> 10:47.522
Male.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.842
Permian era.

10:48.842 --> 10:50.562
Herbivores and burrowers.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.482
Chew their way through anything.

10:52.482 --> 10:54.842
You are an electrician's nightmare.

11:00.322 --> 11:02.002
Come on. That's cute.

11:02.002 --> 11:04.162
Yeah, I mean,
they're social creatures.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.042
Wait. Stay.

11:10.042 --> 11:11.362
Wait.

11:13.282 --> 11:15.162
And quick, too.

11:15.162 --> 11:16.322
Yes.

11:31.162 --> 11:33.082
Let go. Get off it!

11:38.202 --> 11:39.922
You can't have that. It's mine!

11:47.202 --> 11:48.362
(Cutter!)

11:54.482 --> 11:55.922
(Oh, no, no, no, no.)

12:12.522 --> 12:13.562
Hey!

12:13.562 --> 12:15.522
Open the door!

12:22.522 --> 12:25.442
"Final call for everyone
to evacuate the building."

12:25.442 --> 12:26.602
Anything?

12:26.602 --> 12:28.722
No.
"Proceed to your nearest exit."

12:28.722 --> 12:29.802
Cutter?

12:29.802 --> 12:33.242
We're trapped in the operating
theatre with the anomaly and...

12:34.322 --> 12:38.042
a woman who's about to give birth.
I need you here as quick as you can.

12:38.042 --> 12:39.362
"We're on our way."

12:39.362 --> 12:40.922
Where are the theatres?

12:40.922 --> 12:43.362
No idea.
Let's find someone who works here.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.642
I'm a trained soldier.
I can find my way around a hospital.

13:10.042 --> 13:13.202
That's it, little fellow. You're
my ticket to the big time.

13:20.562 --> 13:23.282
Just hold it right there.

13:23.282 --> 13:24.362
No!

13:42.602 --> 13:44.562
What are you doing here?

13:52.442 --> 13:53.642
I work here.

13:54.522 --> 13:56.602
Yes, but what are you doing here now?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.122
I work here.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.762
Are you feeling all right?

14:02.762 --> 14:03.802
Yes.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.882
You don't seem quite yourself.

14:06.842 --> 14:08.362
I'm Professor Nick Cutter.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.482
Strangely enough,
I hadn't actually forgotten that.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.042
Cutter.

14:14.042 --> 14:16.162
You're back. Great.

14:16.162 --> 14:18.322
Erm...I've verified another date,

14:18.322 --> 14:21.642
so I need you to check it
before I add it to the model. Yeah?

14:24.642 --> 14:29.322
Memo to self. Arrange regular mental
health check-ups for all staff.

14:34.242 --> 14:35.962
What is that thing?

14:35.962 --> 14:39.402
The power cuts have caused
a temporary atmospheric overload.

14:39.402 --> 14:41.642
It's kind of like a hurricane,

14:41.642 --> 14:44.082
only made up of electricity.

14:45.922 --> 14:47.722
Do I look daft?

14:47.722 --> 14:50.362
Oh! Ohh!

14:50.362 --> 14:52.362
Oh, I think this is it.

14:52.362 --> 14:54.882
No, you're not having a baby now.

14:54.882 --> 14:56.922
Yeah. Right now.

14:57.962 --> 15:01.962
How difficult can it be to find
an operating theatre in a hospital?

15:01.962 --> 15:04.322
What was that
about being a trained soldier?

15:09.122 --> 15:10.282
Catch it.

15:10.282 --> 15:11.882
What do you mean, catch it?

15:11.882 --> 15:13.082
Catch it!

15:13.082 --> 15:14.562
All right.

15:14.562 --> 15:16.762
OK. Catch it. Get under it.

15:20.042 --> 15:22.162
This.

15:22.162 --> 15:24.202
Maybe we could.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.682
Hello, mate.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.442
My name's Connor. This is...

15:36.402 --> 15:38.362
My name's Connor. How are you?

15:38.362 --> 15:41.282
If I'm not mistaken,
you're a diictodon, right?

15:43.202 --> 15:44.642
Cutter.

15:46.002 --> 15:49.722
This woman is a trained
health professional.

15:49.722 --> 15:51.562
She doesn't look like a nurse.

15:51.562 --> 15:53.162
She's a zookeeper.

15:53.162 --> 15:53.882
What?

15:53.882 --> 15:56.602
How many babies have you delivered?
Dozens.

15:56.602 --> 15:57.802
What kind of babies?

15:58.722 --> 15:59.802
Zebras,

15:59.802 --> 16:01.882
lions,

16:01.882 --> 16:04.082
antelopes...

16:04.082 --> 16:05.642
I delivered a giraffe once.

16:05.642 --> 16:06.802
Ohh!

16:06.802 --> 16:11.962
So, don't worry. The principle
is the same, only hopefully your
baby will have a shorter neck.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.882
I need you to take a look
at these calculations,

16:18.882 --> 16:21.522
but I think that they're as accurate
as possible.

16:23.762 --> 16:25.722
I'm busy now.

16:28.042 --> 16:29.642
You carry on with your work.

16:29.642 --> 16:31.002
I'm trying.

16:31.002 --> 16:33.762
If we feed these figures into
the model, I think -

16:33.762 --> 16:34.722
Be quiet.

16:37.922 --> 16:39.242
Hello.

16:39.242 --> 16:43.362
You've changed. Your clothes.
You weren't wearing that before.

16:43.362 --> 16:45.722
Did something happen
at the hospital?

16:45.722 --> 16:47.602
Yes.

16:50.122 --> 16:53.282
If you're busy right now,
it's not a problem.

16:53.282 --> 16:55.162
I've got things to do too.

17:03.842 --> 17:04.962
I'm leaving now.

17:04.962 --> 17:07.122
You're going back to the hospital?
Yes.

17:08.002 --> 17:09.762
Don't let me hold you up.

17:10.682 --> 17:12.162
Cutter?

17:12.162 --> 17:14.482
Do you remember that drink
we talked about?

17:15.162 --> 17:16.842
How about tonight?

17:16.842 --> 17:18.162
I'm leaving now.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.321
Yeah, I got that.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.722
OK. Bad idea. Forget it.
Maybe another time.

17:26.722 --> 17:28.642
No. There won't be another time.

17:31.602 --> 17:32.842
OK.

17:32.842 --> 17:34.322
Fair enough.

17:34.322 --> 17:36.562
I can handle that.

17:36.562 --> 17:38.522
I appreciate your honesty.

17:39.602 --> 17:41.562
I think.

17:42.602 --> 17:44.242
I'm an idiot.

17:44.242 --> 17:46.682
I'm...an idiot.

17:46.682 --> 17:48.122
Ohh!

17:48.122 --> 17:50.162
I didn't want it to be like this!

17:50.162 --> 17:52.242
I wanted it to be beautiful.

17:52.242 --> 17:54.082
Breathe.
It hurts!

17:54.082 --> 17:57.682
You'll get through this.
You'll soon have a beautiful baby.

17:57.682 --> 17:59.122
It's a girl.

17:59.122 --> 18:03.242
A girl. Ahh! Don't actually
think I'd want to know, but -

18:03.242 --> 18:05.282
I just know it will be.

18:05.282 --> 18:06.882
What's your name?

18:06.882 --> 18:07.922
Nick.

18:07.922 --> 18:09.362
You're a nice man.

18:09.362 --> 18:10.642
Sometimes.

18:14.922 --> 18:16.082
Abby.

18:19.082 --> 18:21.202
(Stick him back
through the anomaly.)

18:23.402 --> 18:25.002
What are you waiting for?

18:25.002 --> 18:26.682
It's a distress call.

18:26.682 --> 18:28.122
It's all right.

18:28.122 --> 18:30.682
Just a hunch.
Maybe it'll attract the others.

18:30.682 --> 18:32.362
It's all right.

18:46.722 --> 18:48.762
They're not here.

18:52.002 --> 18:53.562
What is it, mate?

18:54.642 --> 18:57.042
Hey? What are you trying to tell me?

18:57.042 --> 18:59.162
Oh, fantastic.
Now he's Dr Doolittle.

18:59.162 --> 19:01.202
Sh!

19:01.202 --> 19:03.242
He wasn't making that noise before.

19:04.682 --> 19:06.202
Can you hear that?

19:09.042 --> 19:10.442
Follow me.

19:11.762 --> 19:13.762
Oh, God!

19:13.762 --> 19:15.602
Abby, you're needed here.

19:15.602 --> 19:16.802
It's coming!

19:16.802 --> 19:18.842
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

19:18.842 --> 19:20.882
All right. All right. Push.

19:20.882 --> 19:22.682
Oh, God!

19:22.682 --> 19:24.722
I'm not sure this is working, Abby.

19:33.202 --> 19:34.922
It's coming.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.202
That's it.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.282
Ha! It worked.

19:46.362 --> 19:48.282
The distress call attracts them.

19:48.282 --> 19:49.562
What's going on?

19:49.562 --> 19:51.922
It's just the drugs.
I haven't had any drugs.

20:03.962 --> 20:05.922
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

20:13.882 --> 20:16.042
What are we going to do about her?

20:16.042 --> 20:18.162
I don't know.

20:18.162 --> 20:19.642
She's stuck here now.

20:19.642 --> 20:21.442
Because I'm having a baby!

20:22.522 --> 20:24.562
Sorry.

20:24.562 --> 20:27.322
All right. OK. One last push.

20:27.322 --> 20:29.002
Uuurrgghhh!

20:42.882 --> 20:44.242
Listen to my voice.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.602
"Open the main security gate."

20:59.962 --> 21:01.402
You wanted to see me?

21:01.402 --> 21:03.362
Take a seat.

21:06.362 --> 21:08.042
Have you noticed anything...

21:09.282 --> 21:11.842
..strange about Cutter recently?

21:11.842 --> 21:13.882
How long have you got?

21:13.882 --> 21:15.922
Stranger than normal, I mean.

21:15.922 --> 21:18.002
Well he's not saying much,

21:18.002 --> 21:21.802
and he's suddenly decided to change
his clothes twice today, so...

21:24.122 --> 21:26.082
I'm worried he might be erm...

21:27.962 --> 21:30.162
..unravelling.

21:47.922 --> 21:49.882
I hear you've been looking for me.

21:54.562 --> 21:56.482
Thought I'd save you the trouble.

22:00.348 --> 22:01.588
Get off me!

22:01.588 --> 22:03.588
You should be more careful, Dr Page.

22:04.548 --> 22:05.508
Cutter!

22:06.348 --> 22:07.788
What the hell is going on?

22:12.188 --> 22:13.868
You are so fired.

22:15.908 --> 22:17.348
Don't kill him yet.

22:17.348 --> 22:18.308
Yet?

22:20.228 --> 22:21.948
What have you done?

22:35.148 --> 22:37.108
Guard this door.

22:37.108 --> 22:39.148
Shoot anyone
who tries to get in or out.

22:40.868 --> 22:42.948
Obey no-one else.

22:42.948 --> 22:46.228
My voice is the only voice
you recognise.

22:55.308 --> 22:57.348
So, Cutter's finally gone native.

22:57.348 --> 22:59.628
He would never betray us.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.788
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
he just did.

23:02.788 --> 23:06.468
I know him. And I know he wouldn't
do this of his own free will.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.028
Excellent. No signal.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.308
Did you see the way
she spoke to him?

23:13.308 --> 23:14.588
It was...

23:15.628 --> 23:17.348
pretty weird.

23:31.948 --> 23:33.228
She's beautiful.

23:35.068 --> 23:36.308
It's a boy.

23:38.348 --> 23:39.508
A boy?

23:48.308 --> 23:49.868
Hello, you.

23:52.028 --> 23:53.228
Sorry, we -

23:53.228 --> 23:54.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:57.668 --> 23:59.748
(OK. I'm going to have to go.

23:59.748 --> 24:02.228
The nurse will look after you now.
OK?)

24:02.228 --> 24:04.348
Thank you, for everything.

24:06.188 --> 24:08.588
Do you know
what you're going to call him?

24:10.468 --> 24:12.508
I don't know.

24:12.508 --> 24:14.508
I only had girls' names ready.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.668
Do you think erm...

24:19.948 --> 24:22.748
Do you think he'd be OK
if I called him erm...

24:22.748 --> 24:24.788
..Stanley?

24:26.748 --> 24:29.348
I know it's old-fashioned.
It was my dad's name.

24:30.028 --> 24:31.788
See you around, Stanley.

24:38.828 --> 24:40.868
So, who locked you in?

24:40.868 --> 24:42.868
I don't know.

24:49.548 --> 24:51.508
Yeah.

25:01.028 --> 25:03.268
Looks like they missed
the last bus home.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.948
What shall we do with them?

25:06.508 --> 25:07.988
We keep 'em.

25:07.988 --> 25:09.548
Yeah.

25:09.548 --> 25:11.508
For now.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.868
Come on, guys.

25:14.748 --> 25:16.708
You asked for evidence.

25:16.708 --> 25:19.508
Brilliant.
Tell them to hold the front page.

25:19.508 --> 25:20.628
Really?

25:20.628 --> 25:26.588
No. Not really. You bring me a blurry
photo of a gopher with comedy plastic
teeth and you call this evidence?

25:26.588 --> 25:28.628
A child of ten could have faked that.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.628
This is a prehistoric creature!

25:30.628 --> 25:32.548
Get out of my sight.

25:32.548 --> 25:34.228
Give me one last chance.
Why?

25:34.228 --> 25:36.708
Because it's the biggest story
in history.

25:36.708 --> 25:39.588
Do you really want it to go to
one of your competitors?

25:59.588 --> 26:01.588
It's brilliant, Nick.

26:02.668 --> 26:04.148
Beautiful.

26:07.508 --> 26:09.628
We should have worked on it
together.

26:14.828 --> 26:16.788
What am I talking to you for?

26:21.508 --> 26:25.788
It's as if he had no will
of his own. He just responded
to everything she told him.

26:26.748 --> 26:29.908
You're right. Like he was programmed
to obey her voice.

26:29.908 --> 26:31.188
Exactly.

26:31.188 --> 26:33.348
He didn't even seem to hear
the rest of us.

26:34.348 --> 26:36.308
So, what we have to do...

26:37.388 --> 26:39.428
is get her to change
her instructions.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.668
Why would she do that?

26:43.788 --> 26:46.348
Maybe we can do it for her.

26:54.548 --> 26:56.668
Are you all right in there, guys?
Comfy?

26:59.148 --> 27:01.108
He should have checked our passes.

27:01.108 --> 27:03.108
Yeah. Your men are getting slack.

27:03.108 --> 27:06.228
You go on ahead. I want to have
a little word with security.

27:17.628 --> 27:19.268
Something's not right.

27:19.268 --> 27:21.228
Where is everyone?

27:45.228 --> 27:47.068
It's...it's you.

27:54.588 --> 27:56.588
Put Connor and Abby with the others.

28:10.268 --> 28:12.508
"Is there anything in my voice,
Lester,

28:12.508 --> 28:14.588
anything at all,

28:14.588 --> 28:18.228
that's telling you there's nothing
you can do to make me obey you?

28:18.228 --> 28:20.588
Nothing will stop me doing
what I have to do.

28:21.668 --> 28:23.388
Nothing will stop me...

28:27.948 --> 28:30.788
I just need to paste this
into a new file.

28:32.148 --> 28:34.628
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

28:34.628 --> 28:38.228
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

28:43.748 --> 28:45.068
What is going on?

28:45.068 --> 28:49.228
I was just about to
ask you the same question.
What the hell's got into Cutter?

28:51.668 --> 28:53.588
That's not him.

28:53.588 --> 28:56.108
There's two of him.

28:56.108 --> 28:58.348
Two versions of Cutter.
What a nightmare.

28:59.428 --> 29:01.188
We've got to do something.

29:01.188 --> 29:03.228
Connor, er...

29:03.228 --> 29:05.828
we have to play this audio file

29:05.828 --> 29:07.788
over the internal sound system.

29:08.908 --> 29:10.428
We can't do that from here.

29:21.668 --> 29:23.628
You created this.

29:24.948 --> 29:27.028
I er...

29:27.028 --> 29:29.268
borrowed the technology
from the future.

29:31.028 --> 29:32.988
It's made from your DNA.

29:34.308 --> 29:36.268
Perfect in every physical detail.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.668
Physical.

29:41.668 --> 29:43.668
Hm. It has er...

29:43.668 --> 29:45.388
limited intelligence.

29:45.388 --> 29:48.788
Enough to follow basic instruction.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.308
It's a human being, though?

29:51.388 --> 29:53.348
Free will is what makes us human.

29:54.548 --> 29:56.428
This...

29:57.468 --> 29:59.548
creature has er...

29:59.548 --> 30:02.228
It's nothing more
than a living photocopy.

30:06.508 --> 30:09.028
Please tell me
you didn't do this to Stephen.

30:09.028 --> 30:12.588
No matter what they look like,
they can never be the original.

30:16.828 --> 30:18.788
Why are you doing this, Helen?

30:22.988 --> 30:25.348
Because I have seen
the final destruction

30:25.348 --> 30:28.868
of almost every living creature
on this once-beautiful planet.

30:44.508 --> 30:46.428
I can stop it, Nick.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.988
I can save us from that.

30:47.988 --> 30:50.628
Whatever's going to happen
is going to happen.

30:50.628 --> 30:53.548
We must leave it alone.
Look what happened last time.

30:53.548 --> 30:55.308
You killed Stephen.

30:55.308 --> 30:57.348
I didn't kill Stephen.

30:57.348 --> 30:58.508
You did.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.348
The course of evolution
can be changed.

31:02.348 --> 31:04.388
I can...

31:04.388 --> 31:06.028
restore balance.

31:06.028 --> 31:07.868
You still don't get it, do you?

31:07.868 --> 31:10.068
No matter how many times
you interfere,

31:10.068 --> 31:12.028
you can't get the result you want,

31:12.028 --> 31:14.508
because evolution can't be bent
to your will.

31:15.548 --> 31:17.508
I really hope you're wrong.

31:31.148 --> 31:33.068
Everyone er...OK?

31:33.068 --> 31:34.948
Helen's taken over the ARC.

31:34.948 --> 31:37.628
I know. Her men are crawling
all over the place.

31:37.628 --> 31:40.548
How many men have you got?
Just me. Should be enough.

31:41.748 --> 31:44.868
Becker, we need to get this
to the PA system.

31:44.868 --> 31:46.588
What is it? Doesn't matter.

31:46.588 --> 31:48.708
Come with me.
The rest of you stay here.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.908
You see, you don't know it yet,

31:50.908 --> 31:52.028
but I do.

31:53.468 --> 31:55.108
Know what?

31:55.108 --> 31:59.068
Your work will lead to
predators being created
here in this ARC of yours.

31:59.068 --> 32:00.588
I'd never sanction that.

32:00.588 --> 32:03.628
I've seen them...in the future.

32:03.628 --> 32:04.948
Troops from the ARC.

32:04.948 --> 32:06.428
No. You've got it wrong.

32:06.428 --> 32:09.388
You haven't done it yet.
But sooner or later you will.

32:09.388 --> 32:11.428
And it has to be stopped. You.

32:11.428 --> 32:13.428
You have to be stopped now.

32:14.588 --> 32:16.628
Before it begins.

32:16.628 --> 32:18.668
If you're so sure of this,

32:18.668 --> 32:21.068
then why didn't you get your...

32:21.068 --> 32:24.028
creature to kill me
when he had the chance?

32:24.028 --> 32:26.468
Why don't you just shoot me now?

32:26.468 --> 32:28.988
Because there is something

32:28.988 --> 32:31.148
I still don't understand.

32:40.308 --> 32:41.868
Tell me what this is.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.428
Well?

32:55.428 --> 32:57.428
Do you know or not, Professor?

33:01.268 --> 33:03.228
Of course I do.

33:13.428 --> 33:14.708
Tell me.

33:14.708 --> 33:16.668
No.

33:18.228 --> 33:19.468
You can go to hell.

33:20.908 --> 33:23.628
Give him ten seconds, then shoot him.

33:31.828 --> 33:32.908
All right?

33:40.868 --> 33:42.188
I can't...

33:42.188 --> 33:44.148
Come on, Temple. Hurry up!

33:45.508 --> 33:46.508
Quick.

33:48.948 --> 33:50.588
One.

33:50.588 --> 33:52.068
Two.

33:52.068 --> 33:53.148
Don't do it.

33:53.148 --> 33:54.268
Three.

33:54.268 --> 33:56.748
You can't appeal
to his finer feelings.

33:56.748 --> 33:59.108
Five. Six.
Tell me what this is.

33:59.108 --> 34:01.828
You don't have to do as she says.
Seven.

34:02.868 --> 34:05.188
You have a choice.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.308
Eight.
OK.

34:16.308 --> 34:17.507
Nine.

34:17.507 --> 34:18.947
OK.

34:18.947 --> 34:21.068
I'll tell you.

34:27.467 --> 34:28.947
Put the gun down.

34:38.668 --> 34:40.708
Do you think they made it?

34:40.708 --> 34:42.507
We'll soon find out.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.507
Get off!

34:46.507 --> 34:47.507
Get off!

34:49.388 --> 34:50.748
Abby!

34:57.308 --> 34:58.748
Argh! Argh!

35:00.868 --> 35:02.508
My fingers!

35:27.228 --> 35:28.908
I can handle this, Temple.

35:29.948 --> 35:31.428
I can't.

35:33.188 --> 35:35.788
I can't reach.

35:41.028 --> 35:42.388
Punch him!

35:58.428 --> 36:00.508
"Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:00.508 --> 36:03.588
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:03.588 --> 36:05.588
"Stop. Do nothing."

36:05.588 --> 36:07.228
No! Stop! That's not me!

36:07.228 --> 36:10.308
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:10.308 --> 36:12.868
Stop! That's not me! That's not me!

36:12.868 --> 36:15.308
"Obey my voice."

36:15.308 --> 36:18.388
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:18.388 --> 36:21.188
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:22.868 --> 36:24.268
They did it.

36:25.668 --> 36:28.588
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:30.228 --> 36:32.428
"Obey my voice."

36:32.428 --> 36:34.068
Insurance.

36:34.068 --> 36:35.588
"Obey my voice."

36:35.588 --> 36:36.788
It's over.

36:36.788 --> 36:38.788
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:39.668 --> 36:41.788
Listen to my voice.

36:41.788 --> 36:43.468
Complete your mission.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.748
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:47.028 --> 36:50.228
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

36:52.948 --> 36:54.948
Look, I know that you can hear me.

36:54.948 --> 36:57.108
I know you can understand.

36:57.108 --> 36:58.948
You don't have to obey her.

36:58.948 --> 37:00.868
She made me.

37:00.868 --> 37:03.508
You're a human being.
You have a choice.

37:03.508 --> 37:06.348
Don't listen to him.
Follow your instructions.

37:08.308 --> 37:09.788
You're not a machine.

37:09.788 --> 37:11.908
You're a free man.

37:13.428 --> 37:15.588
You don't want to die.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.228
I don't know what death is.

37:18.228 --> 37:19.868
Trust me,

37:19.868 --> 37:21.548
life's better.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.268
Don't listen to him!

37:35.228 --> 37:36.748
Save yourself.

37:54.456 --> 37:56.496
Guys! Come on.

37:56.496 --> 37:58.456
Come on. Everyone out.

37:59.256 --> 38:00.296
Now!

38:29.576 --> 38:31.136
Cutter?

38:31.296 --> 38:33.296
He's in here!

38:36.496 --> 38:38.096
Cutter.

38:38.096 --> 38:40.096
We've got to get out of here now.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.256
Connor?
Are you OK?

38:47.624 --> 38:49.224
Abby?

38:49.224 --> 38:50.584
What's going on?

38:50.584 --> 38:52.104
It's some sort of bomb.

38:54.024 --> 38:57.944
Right, we've got to prioritise
the casualties.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.264
Where's Helen?

39:00.264 --> 39:01.784
She must be still inside.

39:06.104 --> 39:07.224
Nick.

39:08.704 --> 39:10.984
She wouldn't lift a finger
to save you.

39:11.864 --> 39:13.824
Yeah, I know.

39:13.824 --> 39:15.344
Don't go.

39:15.344 --> 39:16.824
This is a mistake.

39:19.624 --> 39:20.944
I'll be fine.

39:22.384 --> 39:23.544
Cutter!

39:25.024 --> 39:27.064
Where the hell's he going?

39:27.064 --> 39:28.904
Cutter!

40:17.584 --> 40:19.624
Helen.

40:25.184 --> 40:26.464
You came back for me?

40:26.464 --> 40:27.744
Yeah.

40:27.744 --> 40:29.744
You always were sentimental.

40:32.744 --> 40:35.224
Where's the artefact?

40:35.224 --> 40:36.944
It'll be wherever you left it.

40:36.944 --> 40:38.984
What does it do, Nick?

40:38.984 --> 40:41.064
Why is it so important?

40:41.064 --> 40:43.664
I have no idea.
Now, are you coming or aren't you?

40:48.344 --> 40:50.384
I'm sorry, Nick. I can't let you go.

40:50.384 --> 40:52.704
What the hell
are you talking about now?

40:58.104 --> 40:59.704
Oh, for God's sake.

41:01.024 --> 41:02.944
You see, nothing's changed, Nick.

41:04.104 --> 41:06.824
The future is more important
than either of us.

41:06.824 --> 41:09.464
You really know how to pick
your moments.

41:09.464 --> 41:12.224
If you'd seen what I'd seen,
you'd understand.

41:15.824 --> 41:17.784
I'm sorry, Nick.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.504
I wish there was another way.

41:29.424 --> 41:31.224
Know what, Helen?

41:32.624 --> 41:35.344
You're not as smart
as I thought you were.

41:44.264 --> 41:46.104
Get round back there.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.064
Fast!

41:51.664 --> 41:53.864
He's been gone too long.

41:55.224 --> 41:57.144
Be careful.

41:57.144 --> 41:58.824
Connor! Connor!

42:04.224 --> 42:06.184
Cutter!

42:15.824 --> 42:17.784
Cutter!

42:19.304 --> 42:20.344
Cutter?

42:21.784 --> 42:23.744
Cutter?

42:28.104 --> 42:30.064
Cutter.

42:37.384 --> 42:39.384
Connor.

42:39.384 --> 42:41.464
Good man.

42:41.464 --> 42:43.704
You hold on.
I'm going to take you out.

42:43.704 --> 42:44.984
Argh!

42:44.984 --> 42:46.904
Sorry.
Don't.

42:47.784 --> 42:50.104
Don't...do that.

42:51.424 --> 42:53.664
Sorry.

42:53.664 --> 42:55.424
It's OK.

42:55.424 --> 42:57.384
Just sit with me.

42:59.624 --> 43:01.464
All right?

43:01.464 --> 43:03.424
OK.

43:14.064 --> 43:16.024
This...

43:22.624 --> 43:24.584
This matters.

43:26.144 --> 43:28.104
I don't know why.

43:29.264 --> 43:31.224
But it does, so...

43:32.464 --> 43:35.144
You have to find out what it means,
OK?

43:35.144 --> 43:37.104
OK.

43:38.904 --> 43:41.704
It's on you now.

43:41.704 --> 43:43.744
No.

43:43.744 --> 43:45.664
No.

43:45.664 --> 43:49.064
We can do this together.
We've always done it together.

43:49.064 --> 43:51.024
No.

43:51.024 --> 43:52.984
Not this time.

43:57.224 --> 43:58.704
Tell...

44:00.104 --> 44:02.064
Tell Claudia Brown...

44:06.504 --> 44:08.464
Never mind.

44:09.504 --> 44:10.944
It doesn't matter.

44:34.504 --> 44:36.064
Get an ambulance. Quickly.

44:36.064 --> 44:37.504
Nick.

44:38.504 --> 44:39.984
It's too late.

44:46.064 --> 44:47.384
What?

44:55.744 --> 44:57.704
He can't be.

44:58.824 --> 45:00.664
Oh, God.

45:00.664 --> 45:02.624
There was something
I had to tell him.

45:19.424 --> 45:21.504
I won't let you down, Professor.

45:21.504 --> 45:23.984
We should get this man
in an ambulance now!

45:44.664 --> 45:47.504
Two minutes. I can have this thing
up and running.

45:47.504 --> 45:50.304
It's a velociraptor. A young one.

45:55.184 --> 45:56.984
You need all the help you can get.

45:58.544 --> 46:00.344
Let's turn and burn.
