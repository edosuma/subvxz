01:10.236 --> 01:12.614
Coran, you've got incoming.

01:26.669 --> 01:27.629
Shield!

01:34.511 --> 01:38.139
- Hunk, form cannon.
- You got it!

01:58.159 --> 01:59.410
He's too fast!

02:00.578 --> 02:03.998
Then we'll have to get in close.
Form sword!

02:23.309 --> 02:28.690
Now we will see how Alfor's legacy stands
against the new Altean defender.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.531
Move!

02:52.422 --> 02:53.506
Shield up!

02:55.466 --> 02:56.885
Attack!

03:19.741 --> 03:21.534
We can't touch him. He's too fast.

03:21.618 --> 03:25.413
We need to stop him moving around,
back him into a corner or something.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.125
Hunk is right. We have to eliminate
his speed advantage.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.543
Limit his movements.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.545
There!

03:36.633 --> 03:38.301
Now we lure him in close.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.045
Wait for him.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.048
Let him build up speed.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.718
Now!

04:42.490 --> 04:43.533
Where'd he go?

04:45.660 --> 04:46.995
He's behind us.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.205
Hunk, hit him
with the shoulder cannon.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.123
On it.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.335
Fire!

05:01.509 --> 05:03.177
Did we get him?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.638
-I don't know.
-I think we got him.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.682
It looked like he just disappeared.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.685
-Yeah! We got him.
-I'm not so sure.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.755
Is everyone okay?

05:38.838 --> 05:42.091
-How is he moving so fast?
-We've gotta get up and attack.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.266
Okay, so that time
we definitely did not get him.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.498
How can he just disappear like that?

06:13.581 --> 06:16.834
He's entering
the quintessence field at will.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.296
-Didn't we blow up the gate?
-How is he entering without it?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.674
Because I gave his ships the ability.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.473
Unlimited power is mine.

06:30.556 --> 06:34.060
All realities will fall
to the new Altean Empire.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.469
We have to go in after him.

07:08.553 --> 07:12.390
Getting power from the quintessence
is the only way we can match his strength.

07:12.473 --> 07:16.853
-Can we do that?
-If he can do it, Voltron can. Can't we?

07:17.854 --> 07:22.150
My father did it once before,
but it's extremely dangerous.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.235
Do we have a choice?

07:24.318 --> 07:25.653
We need your help, Allura.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.074
- We have to try.
- I may be able to guide us in,

07:30.158 --> 07:32.827
but I'll need you all
to focus your energy.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.659
Form sword.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.116
Huh?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.118
Whoa.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.755
I underestimated you, Princess.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.368
We took a major shot, but I feel fine.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.121
All this quintessence is keeping us
at full power.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.499
It's more than that.
Can you hear your Lions talking to you?

09:44.208 --> 09:47.128
Voltron is capable
of more than we ever imagined.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.686
Attack!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.254
See if you can dodge this!

10:34.925 --> 10:36.093
Come and get some!

10:44.644 --> 10:46.771
- Let's end this!
- Finish him!

10:46.854 --> 10:48.230
Let's destroy that guy!

10:49.482 --> 10:52.234
-We have to get out of here.
-What are you talking about?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.695
This is exactly what happened
to Zarkon.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.823
Exposure to all this quintessence
turned him into a monster!

11:01.077 --> 11:02.203
Poor Allura!

11:02.286 --> 11:04.914
All the power in the universe
at your fingertips

11:04.997 --> 11:08.167
and you still fear using it.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.047
Allura's right. We're out of control!

11:13.130 --> 11:14.965
All our systems are overloaded.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.759
Here comes Lotor.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.937
How do we stop this?

11:30.189 --> 11:33.359
We give Lotor all the power he wants.

13:02.781 --> 13:07.620
-Let's grab Lotor and get out of here.
-No, we can't. We have to leave now.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.372
-We must try.
-Pidge is right.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.917
We stay in here much longer
and Voltron is done for.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.712
But we can't just leave him.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.883
Allura, we gotta go now.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.012
Lotor's made his choice.
Let's get out of here, Allura.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.698
If we'd stayed in the quintessence field,

13:44.782 --> 13:47.368
we would've kept fighting
until we destroyed ourselves.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.286
Just like Lotor.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.997
What did you do in there?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.208
I transferred the excess power
from Voltron.

13:55.125 --> 13:59.547
It's a technique I learned on Oriande.
Thanks to Lotor.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.885
Thank you, Allura. You saved us.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.973
Not just us. The entire universe.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.892
Oh, you're back!

14:11.976 --> 14:13.811
Lotor is no longer a threat.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.772
Right. I'm afraid
we face a bigger threat now.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.525
Lotor's jumping in and out
of the quintessence field

14:19.608 --> 14:23.195
created multiple growing rifts
in the fabric of time and space.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.488
What does that mean?

14:24.572 --> 14:29.034
It means unless we do something fast,
those tears will continue to expand

14:29.118 --> 14:32.538
until all of existence
as we know it has been destroyed.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.124
There has to be something
we can do.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.419
Scanning the rift for any strand
refabrication possibilities.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.753
I'm running models to see

14:39.837 --> 14:42.006
if there's any chance it can close
on its own.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.884
Nothing.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.760
Nope. Me neither.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.512
How long do we have?

14:48.596 --> 14:52.516
Based on the way those rifts
are expanding, about 15 doboshes.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.394
Allura, you have to have a way
to close it.

14:55.477 --> 14:59.189
Voltron opened it up, maybe we can...
I don't know! There's gotta be a way!

14:59.273 --> 15:03.402
I'm sorry, but I just don't possess
that level of alchemic knowledge.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.363
The only thing that could possibly
pull that rift closed

15:06.447 --> 15:09.992
would be a source of gravity more powerful
than a supermassive black hole.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.746
Any chance we can find one
and tow it over here in 15 doboshes?

15:14.538 --> 15:16.498
Wait a tick. The teludav.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.293
- What about it?
- To make wormhole jumps,

15:19.376 --> 15:21.962
the teludav creates a brief flash
of infinite mass.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.925
There might be a way I can overload
the teludav reactor and seal the rift.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.094
If one of the flashes went off
in the rift, it could do the job.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.973
But that would mean
sacrificing the Castle of Lions.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.894
What choice do we have? The Castle
will be wiped out with the rest of us.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.771
But still...

15:38.854 --> 15:39.939
it's been our home.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.776
Oh, I hate to say goodbye
to my grandfather's creation,

15:43.859 --> 15:45.945
the last piece of the real Altea.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.490
Coran, begin preparations.

15:49.573 --> 15:53.702
Everyone else, start unloading the Castle.
We need to evacuate immediately.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.849
Goodbye, old friend.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.641
It worked.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.393
You did it, Coran.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.020
And look.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.485
What is it?

18:33.070 --> 18:34.363
It's a diamond.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.700
The pressure crushed the Castle of Lions
into this little diamond.

18:47.334 --> 18:51.255
Well, we saved all realities everywhere.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.923
What do you guys want to do now?

18:53.549 --> 18:55.843
We need
to find some place to land

18:55.926 --> 18:58.178
and see if there's some way
we can help Shiro.

19:15.362 --> 19:19.074
This body is barely living,
but Shiro's spirit is alive.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.828
It's inside the Black Lion.
I've heard him talking to me.

19:23.954 --> 19:28.834
He... he tried to tell me,
but I didn't realize.

19:32.379 --> 19:37.050
I'm so sorry, Shiro.
I-- I didn't know. I could've...

22:12.914 --> 22:14.166
You found me.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.627
We're glad you're back, Shiro.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.504
Rest.

22:26.094 --> 22:29.222
So what are we gonna do?
The Castle is destroyed.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.768
There's only one place
that has the plans necessary

22:32.851 --> 22:35.187
to build a replacement
for the Castle of Lions.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.731
Coran gave them to my dad.

22:42.402 --> 22:43.612
We're going home.
