WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.620
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.869
The FBI conducted a drone strike.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.293
| can now confirm that Patrick Lloyd
has been neutralized.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.042
[Hannah] Lloyd's on the run for six
months, and the last thing he does

00:11.178 --> 00:12.760
is trash the First Lady's mother's house?

00:12.888 --> 00:15.596
He wasn't looking for something.
He was leaving us something.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.306
[Alex] Is this really necessary?

00:17.434 --> 00:19.266
We have to vet everything
that Patrick Lloyd touched.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.307
It's the insurance form
for my dad's heart transplant.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.431
Let's head around back.
| cut a hole in the fence.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.649
-Hannah!
-[explosion]

00:28.737 --> 00:32.275
Do you guys want to tell me what you're
doing on private property after hours?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.315
That supposed to impress me, Agent Wells?

00:34.451 --> 00:37.159
No, it's just to show you that we're
working a federal investigation

00:37.287 --> 00:39.324
and that I don't have to answer
any of your questions.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.322
The First Lady's mother gives inside info

00:41.458 --> 00:43.995
to a government contractor
in order to win a bid.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.744
So the First Lady's father
could move up the transplant list?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.588
-A bribe? And which employee signed this?
-Eric Little.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.969
Eric Little.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.835
[siren walls in distance]

00:54.972 --> 00:57.179
[Blakey] So, this is
your complete statement?

00:57.307 --> 00:58.638
Yes.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.386
You noticed the door had been pushed in.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.980
You entered the premises because
you suspected a crime was ongoing.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.974
You found a dead body. You called it in.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.441
That's right.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.856
-And you didn't know Eric Little?
-No.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.485
-You'd never been to his house before?
-Nope.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.827
You mind telling me what you were doing
in his neighborhood?

01:20.956 --> 01:23.323
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.327
[clears throat]
A warehouse burns down, you're there.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.373
A dead body turns up, you're there.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.373
Now, why are you at the epicenter
of every crime in Reston?

01:32.509 --> 01:36.093
Look, Detective. You're just trying
to do your job. I understand that.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.303
If I were you, I would be frustrated, too,

01:38.432 --> 01:40.799
but some things are just...
above your pay grade.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.641
You get to play that card once, not twice.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.557
It's not a card. It's a reality check.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.556
Well, let me give you one:

01:48.692 --> 01:50.023
whatever you're mixed up in,

01:50.152 --> 01:53.611
your hands better be clean, or even
this place can't protect you.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.860
You and I go way back, John.
| didn't know who else to turn to.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.702
So no one in the White House knows?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.412
Well, no one in a position of power.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.202
| didn't want to set off any alarm bells
unless I had to.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.747
-You already have.
-By keeping a lid on it?

02:08.878 --> 02:12.213
By stonewalling a police investigation
into the murder of a contractor

02:12.341 --> 02:13.581
who allegedly bribed
the First Lady's mother?

02:13.717 --> 02:16.049
Allegedly, John. This is Lloyd.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.421
This is his last desperate act
to bring down the presidency.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.388
Yeah, it doesn't mean
that there's nothing here.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.020
So what now?

02:26.855 --> 02:29.017
If it's cancer,
you have to tell the patient.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.395
[scoffs]
But what if it's not?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.438
| need time to... to dig into this.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.063
| need time to disprove this,
and if I can do that,

02:37.199 --> 02:39.406
then I don't have to bring
the President into the loop.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.698
Okay, but if you can't disprove it,
you've impeded an investigation.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.366
| don't think I have
a better option right now.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.294
[sighs]

02:52.422 --> 02:54.629
Look, there may be a way
to give yourself some cover

02:54.758 --> 02:57.420
so the whole weight of this
doesn't fall on you if things go south.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.713
I'm listening.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.466
You want to protect the President,

03:01.598 --> 03:03.100
bring the White House Counsel
into the loop.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.220
Kendra Daynes has got
the President's back, right?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.593
Yes.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.222
Yes, but will she have mine?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.820
[theme music]

03:21.118 --> 03:24.611
[chanting] Hell no, Mexico!
Your lousy junk has got to go!...

03:25.789 --> 03:28.952
[reporter] Tensions continue to rise
on both sides of the border

03:29.084 --> 03:31.325
as American truckers enter
the sixth day of their blockade.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.873
[reporter #2] The truckers are
protesting trade negotiations,

03:34.005 --> 03:37.293
which have dragged on for two months now
without signs of a breakthrough.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.042
[reporter #3] Jake from Laredo,
you're on the air.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.135
[Jake] I'm sick and tired of Mexico
Stealing our jobs and taking our money.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.504
Give 'em hell, truckers!

03:43.640 --> 03:47.133
[man] This blockade is totally illegal!
It's a racist move against all Mexicans!

03:47.269 --> 03:48.600
[woman] Apparently, the White House

03:48.729 --> 03:50.686
believes doing nothing
will make the problem go away.

03:50.814 --> 03:54.148
[man] They couldn't be more wrong.
Make no mistake about it:

03:54.276 --> 03:57.109
this situation is a powder keg
just waiting to explode.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.855
[engine starts]

04:00.991 --> 04:03.358
[conversing in Spanish]

04:03.493 --> 04:04.870
[shouting indistinctly]

04:07.831 --> 04:08.821
[truck horn blows]

04:08.957 --> 04:13.542
[guards shouting in Spanish]

04:13.670 --> 04:16.002
[horn blares]

04:17.173 --> 04:19.836
[gunshots]

04:19.968 --> 04:21.629
[indistinct shouting]

04:24.514 --> 04:25.629
Move!

04:28.602 --> 04:30.559
[gunshots]

04:33.064 --> 04:34.225
[in Spanish]

04:40.322 --> 04:41.403
-Gracias.
-[cellphone beeps]

04:41.531 --> 04:43.909
[reporter] The slain trucker has
been identified as José Menez,

04:44.034 --> 04:46.526
a Mexican national.
An autopsy has been ordered.

04:46.912 --> 04:50.371
More than $2 billion a day; that's what
the blockade's costing our economy.

04:50.499 --> 04:54.333
$10 billion so far, and the meter keeps
ticking until we get this trade deal done.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.327
Aaron, what'd the Mexican ambassador
have to say?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.249
Not a lot I'd like to translate, sir.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.759
So, Mexico is our most important
trading partner,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.716
Americans are worried
about their jobs

05:02.844 --> 05:04.926
and will hold you responsible
if you don't protect them,

05:05.055 --> 05:07.217
and the administration
needs this trade deal

05:07.349 --> 05:09.431
to prove itself
on the international stage.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.220
But after the shooting,
the coordinated blockade

05:11.353 --> 05:13.936
at every U.S. point of entry's
just gonna get harder to break.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.931
Where are we at with the Mexican trade
rep and our favorite union leader?

05:17.067 --> 05:19.354
They both walked, but we're trying
to get them back to the table.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.693
We all know what we need to do.
Let's get it done.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.740
You want us to cook your food,
cut your grass,

05:25.867 --> 05:29.030
raise your children,
but treating us justly?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.904
The United States is already the largest
market for Mexican goods.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.577
-A reasonable excise tax--
-Oh, here comes the tariff pitch.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.576
The offer that is on the table
will help reduce many of those tariffs,

05:37.712 --> 05:39.214
but you have to meet us halfway.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.754
This blockade...

05:45.595 --> 05:47.211
hurts both countries.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.095
Exactly.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.842
But my people have
a different pain threshold.

05:52.978 --> 05:56.471
See, we're willing to suffer
for better opportunities,

05:56.606 --> 05:58.062
a better manana...

05:59.776 --> 06:01.278
...a better deal.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.153
[door opens]

06:08.285 --> 06:12.074
Businesses are moving their factories
to Mexico to exploit cheap labor.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.448
And the President's policies
of low tariffs and free trade--

06:15.584 --> 06:17.666
-Paul, you're a dinosaur.
-I'm sorry?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.455
You're not familiar
with the whole Jurassic thing?

06:19.588 --> 06:20.794
| know what a dinosaur is.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.333
They're extinct,
which is where you're headed.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.332
50 years ago, a third of U.S. workers
were unionized.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.846
-Now it's 1 in 10.
-Okay, so if I'm a dying breed,

06:27.971 --> 06:31.384
-why do I have a seat at the table?
-Because organized labor still matters.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.759
Where you lead, they follow,
but Paul, you need to face facts.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.930
Enlighten me.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.269
Undocumented workers
take jobs Americans won't.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.935
Cheap Mexican goods
force us to innovate.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.650
Oh, Mexicans crashing the border
and trying to run down Americans--

06:43.778 --> 06:46.941
-He was driving on the shoulder.
-It's symbolic, Lyor.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.906
You want symbolism?

06:50.035 --> 06:53.323
It's a dead Mexican on the spin cycle,
not a dead American.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.196
They walk away, they're justified.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.448
You walk away,
well, you're unreasonable.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.871
Yes, we're concerned
that Mexico's voided the pact,

07:01.004 --> 07:02.995
but we've made solid progress
towards a new agreement.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.338
And with Labor's backing,
the U.S. has been able

07:05.467 --> 07:07.504
to lower tariffs on select Mexican goods,

07:07.636 --> 07:10.128
and the Mexican government
has responded positively.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.549
[indistinct shouting]

07:11.681 --> 07:14.343
Do you expect the Mexican position
to change now that we know

07:14.476 --> 07:16.968
the bullet that killed Mr. Menez
came from an American gun?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.390
| don't, um...

07:19.522 --> 07:22.810
The only information I have is that
Mr. Menez was hit multiple times.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.401
The M.E. has just confirmed the kill shot
was an American one

07:25.528 --> 07:26.563
based on the angle of entry.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.734
Okay, I mean, even if that's true,
the truckers have a self-defense claim.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.573
Mr. Menez was driving
on the side of the road.

07:31.701 --> 07:35.365
Okay, well, they may have had every reason
to suspect that he was going to swerve.

07:35.497 --> 07:39.491
Uh, and if that's true, then, uh, they
had every right to stand their ground.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.991
Will the shooting be investigated?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.913
Sounds like that's a question
for local authorities.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.504
Is the President going
to condemn American gun violence?

07:46.508 --> 07:49.591
Um, I'm sorry, guys.
| can sidebar on that with you later.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.710
[indistinct shouting]

07:54.349 --> 07:57.558
So, is this shooting a referendum
on American gun violence?

07:57.686 --> 08:01.224
No, it's a referendum on the dangers of
running the border at 90 miles an hour.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.390
Mr. Shore, do you have
a position on this?

08:04.526 --> 08:06.858
Uh, no, I do not,
but the administration does,

08:06.987 --> 08:09.228
which is that this sad situation
reinforces the need

08:09.364 --> 08:10.946
for the parties to get back to the table.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.236
But as the only Mexican-American
on the President's senior staff--

08:13.368 --> 08:15.359
| don't serve the President
as a Mexican-American.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.576
What do you serve him as?

08:16.705 --> 08:19.242
As a National Security Advisor.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.409
[in Spanish]

08:27.757 --> 08:28.918
[door opens]

08:30.552 --> 08:32.042
This latest news
has further jeopardized

08:32.178 --> 08:34.635
the stalled trade agreement
between the United States and Mexico.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.630
Mexican-American leaders
in the United States

08:36.765 --> 08:38.472
are calling for rallies
across the country

08:38.601 --> 08:41.558
to protest the fatal shooting
of trucker José Mene-z.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.308
Everybody was shooting;

08:43.440 --> 08:46.273
Mexicans, Americans,
civilians, law enforcement.

08:46.401 --> 08:50.645
This tragedy is the very definition
of collective responsibility.

08:50.780 --> 08:54.023
But it was an American
who fired the fatal shot.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.277
Yes, and it shifts
the negotiation equilibrium.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.450
-Mexico is gonna up its demands now.
-[Emily] That's already happened.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.994
Arronte's asking for expanded
rights for undocumented workers

09:03.126 --> 09:05.037
and rollbacks on agricultural tariffs.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.502
Both of which will go over like
a lead balloon with Zalesky.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.587
-So we're back to square one.
-I'm afraid so, sir.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.957
We need to mobilize
the Hispanic-American community.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.051
They're the honest brokers in this. They
can bring both sides back to the table.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.342
| reached out to the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.806
-Senator Flores is en route.
-Okay, good.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.675
We need a political solution and fast.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.017
Yes, sir.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.078
We have a broken vase.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.543
That's not a sentence I've heard
since my babysitting days.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.083
-A broken vase in the West Wing.
-Okay.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.049
A gift from the Imperial Chinese Court
to Rutherford B. Hayes.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.544
-This isn't getting more interesting.
-There's paperwork.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.341
Stuff breaks. Have the Office of
Management and Budget file a claim.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.680
-Done.
-Thanks.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.012
Dax, I am so sorry.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.384
Oh, that's all right, sir.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.432
| understand you have
a few items on your plate.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.896
<i>Unfortunately, the trade
agreement is the entree.</i>

10:09.025 --> 10:11.232
-I'm gonna have to push our dinner.
-No problem.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.817
| brought you something, by the way.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.529
-The new electric car?
-Yes, sir.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.898
Wow.

10:18.034 --> 10:22.403
Zero to 60 in 3 flat, carbon-neutral,
400 miles to a charge,

10:22.539 --> 10:24.906
rolling off the assembly lines
this spring.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.372
Which assembly lines?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.913
We have plants in Tijuana and Flint.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.582
Well, that explains why you haven't
called me about the trade deal.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.920
Correct.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.211
I'm the human version of carbon-neutral.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.211
Plus, in three years, my factories
will be completely automated.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.596
So labor's not your concern.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.056
No, sir. It's cadmium.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.348
Impressive. I owe you a meal.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.141
-Oh.
-Come on, let me walk you out.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.060
-Sure.
-[Kendra] Here's the good news:

10:51.192 --> 10:53.524
there's no legal jeopardy
for the First Lady's mother.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.859
Even if she took a bribe?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.104
Yes. The statute of limitations
is long past.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.481
It's the contractor's death
that's the problem.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.281
Well, only if you're a conspiracy
theorist. Doesn't lead anywhere.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.826
Before we worry about where it leads,
let's worry about where you're leading it.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.950
You're a White House employee.
Your actions are imputed to the President.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.420
Why is everyone confusing
investigating with obstructing?

11:13.548 --> 11:14.959
Because there's a fine line
between the two.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.423
And if you want to stay
on the right side of it,

11:17.552 --> 11:19.384
you have to jump through
certain hoops.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.968
You mean speak
to the First Lady's mother?

11:21.097 --> 11:24.215
Yes. The case against her
is highly circumstantial.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.468
You get her denial on record,
the contractor's death,

11:27.604 --> 11:30.437
anything else Lloyd may have dug up,
becomes immaterial.

11:30.565 --> 11:34.103
| am not asking a 70-year-old woman whose
daughter is married to the President

11:34.235 --> 11:36.897
-whether she committed a crime.
-No, that would be imprudent.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.862
-Exactly.
-You have to ask the First Lady.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.323
[sighs]

11:43.244 --> 11:45.952
Senator Flores, the President wants
to bring both sides back to the table.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.616
How can we work together to...

11:49.584 --> 11:50.699
Nadia?

11:50.835 --> 11:52.451
El primo!
[laughs]

11:52.587 --> 11:53.668
[chuckles]

11:53.796 --> 11:56.538
-So great to see you!
-Well, it's great to see you, too.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.631
Look, I-I'm meeting with
Senator Flores right now--

11:58.760 --> 12:00.216
No, you're not.
[chuckles]

12:00.345 --> 12:01.631
She sent me.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.801
Uh, you work
with Representative Yoshida.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.389
| did, until about two weeks ago.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.649
-I sent you like two messages about it.
-I'm... I'm sorry, I--

12:12.774 --> 12:14.856
Anyway, I know
how busy you are, so...

12:14.984 --> 12:16.315
why don't we jump in?

12:20.657 --> 12:21.988
Okay.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.859
The first item of business is amnesty.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.532
Wait, th-the CBO estimates
that would cost the U.S. economy

12:28.665 --> 12:30.872
$2.6 trillion in the first year alone.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.252
That doesn't take into account

12:32.377 --> 12:34.038
the taxes people
living in the shadows would pay.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.003
It's a non-starter, Nadia.
We don't have bipartisan support.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.671
Let's put a pin in that
and talk about remittance provision.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.007
Nadia, I think it best for me

12:45.139 --> 12:47.426
to interface with the senator
directly on all these things.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.177
[chatter]

12:54.357 --> 12:56.894
Ms. Rhodes. Maya Dunning, OMB.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.528
[sighs]
The vase, right?

12:58.653 --> 13:01.020
It's only a covered event
if the breakage is accidental,

13:01.155 --> 13:02.691
-not deliberate.
-It was accidental.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.531
Well, I don't know that.
[chuckles]

13:04.659 --> 13:07.367
The White House hasn't declared war
on Chinese ceramics, Mrs. Dunning.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.362
I'm still required
to conduct an investigation.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.206
If you leave me out of it,
you can wheel in Hercule Poirot.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.660
Thank you.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.296
[Alex] Well, thank you
for bringing this to my attention.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.541
-Of course.
-I don't need to tell you what I think

13:22.677 --> 13:24.759
about the prospect
of involving my mother

13:24.887 --> 13:28.596
in any of this, um, but I guess sometimes,
it's better to head things off

13:28.725 --> 13:30.215
-at the pass.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.602
Which makes Agent Wells' deception
even more difficult to understand.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.308
Ma'am?

13:36.441 --> 13:39.729
You had me poring through documents,
hundreds of them,

13:39.861 --> 13:41.602
when you were only
interested in this one.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.354
| believe that Agent Wells--

13:43.489 --> 13:45.105
Can speak for herself,
thank you, Kendra.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.409
| didn't know
if there was anything to this,

13:50.538 --> 13:52.654
and if there wasn't,
| didn't want to trouble you.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.373
So you decided to insult me
with some ruse,

13:55.501 --> 13:58.118
-playing me for a fool?
-That was never my intention.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.915
So, now that everything's
on the table,

14:00.048 --> 14:04.042
| hope you can see how absurd
this bribery suggestion really is.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.303
At this stage, there's no indication
whether it's credible or not.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.468
Of course there isn't.
My mom was a secretary.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.090
She was not
an administrator, okay?

14:12.226 --> 14:16.060
She didn't deal with executives
or hand out contracts.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.100
-She got coffee.
-I understand that, but --

14:18.232 --> 14:21.020
So you still find it plausible
that a contractor,

14:21.152 --> 14:23.519
who was looking
for a big piece of business,

14:23.654 --> 14:26.692
would think that my mother
was the right person to bribe?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.861
I'm not saying
that it's plausible, ma'am.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.609
I'm saying that we have
circumstantial evidence--

14:30.745 --> 14:32.656
That my mother is a criminal.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.161
Ma'am, the intention
is not to upset you.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.795
Hannah is here at my urging.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.786
And she should know,
more than anyone,

14:40.922 --> 14:43.630
how crazy Lloyd was
and how much he hated my husband

14:43.758 --> 14:46.967
and how no smear was beneath that man.
Right, Agent Wells?

14:47.762 --> 14:49.173
Yes, ma'am.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.012
So maybe you should have
considered all of this

14:51.140 --> 14:53.518
before you came to me
with this manufactured nonsense.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.475
Sorry to trouble you, Mrs. Kirkman.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.609
-As you can see, some very upset...
-[knocking]

15:08.741 --> 15:10.197
Yeah, come in.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.819
...protesting the death of Mexican
citizen José Menez in the--

15:13.955 --> 15:16.947
Well, Mexico's winning
the PR battle at home and abroad.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.417
-They're hardening their stance.
-Meanwhile, we are turning on each other.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.912
There's been an upsurge of violence
at the border crossings.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.629
Where are we with the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus?

15:24.757 --> 15:28.045
| had a productive meeting
with, uh, Senator Flores' aide.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.793
Aide?
Aaron, that's not good enough.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.842
She's sitting on her hands. We need her
out there defending our position.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.181
-I'll tell her, sir.
-Where are we at with Labor?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.266
-[knock on door]
-Mr. President...

15:38.187 --> 15:39.894
You need to see this.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.569
This White House
is worried about globalism.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.402
Well, hey, I'm worried
about our country.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.020
Mr. President, the American worker

15:49.157 --> 15:53.242
won't support your agenda
if you don't support him.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.202
You tell Mr. Zalesky
if he keeps trying to undercut me,

15:56.330 --> 15:58.788
-he's gonna regret it.
-Yes, sir.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.953
You've got to give them
their jobs back.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.416
That's how this works.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.957
You have to roll back everything
you've been doing for the past...

16:05.089 --> 16:07.205
Damn Stegosaurus.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.881
[Maya] It's a simple questionnaire.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.095
It's 12 pages.
I'm not having the White House staff

16:14.223 --> 16:16.305
answer a 12-page questionnaire
about broken pottery.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.550
The comprehensive one is 26.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.519
This is officially a covered event,
the result of an accident.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.684
| think that that conclusion
is premature.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.398
Okay, then, you can take it up
with my boss.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.608
He's in the office down the hall,
the big oval one.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.399
[indistinct conversations]

16:39.040 --> 16:40.906
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.248
You good?

16:42.627 --> 16:44.243
Oh, semi-good.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.995
You know, you ever get
a feeling like you...

16:47.131 --> 16:48.667
just can't make anyone happy?

16:48.799 --> 16:50.381
That would be my childhood.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.251
-[laughs]
-Thanks a lot.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.511
Yeah, you know, this trade deal...

16:55.640 --> 16:58.758
everyone's wondering if
I'm doing enough for their side.

16:58.893 --> 16:59.928
[stammers]

17:00.061 --> 17:01.677
The only side I'm on
is the President's.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.974
Yeah, I know what it's like
to be stuck in the middle.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.561
You want to know when that ends?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.897
-When?
-Never!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.438
[scoffs]

17:12.906 --> 17:17.902
6.2 million undocumented Mexican workers
in the United States, Aaron.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.538
-It's a national emergency.
-We're aware, Senator Flores,

17:21.665 --> 17:23.998
which is why the President
is committed to working with you

17:24.126 --> 17:25.627
to ease their path to citizenship.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.618
Then why is that not reflected
in the agreement?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.792
Because it should focus
on trade. I-It's economics.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.289
Both of which are tied to people.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.551
The President believes in people,

17:32.677 --> 17:34.884
and he believes in honoring his word,
which you have.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.471
You endorse this agreement, the
White House will be extremely grateful.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.217
[sighs]

17:42.353 --> 17:45.391
Well, this is not ideal, but...

17:45.523 --> 17:48.060
| suppose very little is in this world.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.524
Meaning you'll come out publicly
in support of the President?

17:50.653 --> 17:51.518
You have my word.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.986
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:58.286 --> 18:02.826
Senator... may I address
a personal matter?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.831
| didn't appreciate you
deploying my cousin

18:05.960 --> 18:07.997
to manipulate me on a legislative matter.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.917
Um, Aaron, I think you misunderstand.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.505
No, no, I don't think I do.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.500
| sent Nadia to the White House

18:15.636 --> 18:18.845
because she is a highly prized
and capable aide.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.714
Who happens to be related to me.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.598
Look, trying to leverage that

18:22.727 --> 18:25.014
isn't going to open doors for you, ma'am.
It's gonna close them.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.141
[camera shutters clicking]

18:31.861 --> 18:34.353
My husband loved America.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.733
He hoped to join me
and our children here one day.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.155
But I'm still not a citizen...

18:46.167 --> 18:47.749
so he couldn't.

18:49.170 --> 18:53.004
He was killed by the people
he dreamed one day...

18:54.550 --> 18:56.166
...would be his neighbors.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.212
[Aaron] I just got off the phone
with President Moreno's office,

19:01.349 --> 19:02.760
and they're saying
he won't intervene.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.053
Of course not.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.643
He can't put his personal prestige
on the line for something like this.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.432
Why not? I've put mine on the line.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.305
Yes, but you're not up
for re-election in four months.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.103
[sighs]
Where are we at with Paul Zalesky?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.613
| had a "come to Lyor" talk
with him last night.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.445
-He'll stand down.
-[Emily] For now.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.280
The Congressional
Hispanic Caucus' support

19:19.408 --> 19:20.819
gained us some ground domestically,

19:20.951 --> 19:23.079
but Arronte's still insisting
on rollbacks.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.946
If Zalesky responds, we're back
where we started again.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.073
All of this is happening
because of the shooting, right?

19:28.209 --> 19:28.949
Yes, sir.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.918
It's hard to talk substance
when emotions are running high.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.378
Well, of course, and now there's
a human cost to the debate.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.714
Meanwhile, on both sides of the border,

19:36.842 --> 19:38.799
families are struggling
to eke out a living.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.168
Like José Menez.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.176
-[Aaron] We can reach out to his widow.
-Yes.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.515
She's a legal U.S. resident from Mexico.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.931
Maybe she can help us bridge the divide.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.645
That's actually pretty good.

19:50.773 --> 19:54.107
We could stop talking substance,
put a human face on the tragedy.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.475
Yeah, a photo op would show Mexico

19:55.611 --> 19:58.023
that America cares about the plight
of the undocumented immigrant.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.657
And it'll soften Arronte up.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.898
He blinks first, Labor will fall in line.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.992
He'd end the blockade, open up
the borders, and close this deal.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.953
Let's try it. Seth, please, set it up.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.540
Mom, I-I'm embarrassed
to even ask you this,

20:15.673 --> 20:18.210
but it's just something I...
| have to put to bed, okay?

20:18.342 --> 20:21.334
So, this is a purchase order

20:21.470 --> 20:25.634
for helicopters
that Icarus Astrotech won.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.803
| know what it is.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.178
Okay, s-so, there's this allegation -

20:31.313 --> 20:33.475
it's a crazy allegation -

20:33.607 --> 20:36.349
that you helped Icarus
in exchange--

20:36.485 --> 20:39.568
You know, even hearing myself
say this out loud, I--

20:39.697 --> 20:41.984
Alex, ask me the question.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.824
Did you accept a bribe?

20:45.870 --> 20:46.905
Yes.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.199
What?

20:49.331 --> 20:51.072
Oh, you knew that already, right?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.710
No, I didn't.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.245
-Y-You were a secretary.
-With access to the bid specs.

20:57.715 --> 21:00.878
When you're a contractor and you know
what the government's looking for,

21:01.010 --> 21:02.500
you have the inside track.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.013
So you broke the law?

21:05.890 --> 21:07.676
To save your father's life.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.678
Absolutely.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.727
He was gonna die.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.898
Alex, if he got his heart transplant,

21:17.526 --> 21:22.066
you think I cared about who got
to build the stupid helicopter?

21:22.198 --> 21:25.441
-Mom, why didn't you tell me this?!
-Why would 1?

21:25.576 --> 21:28.193
Because my husband is president!

21:28.871 --> 21:31.158
And had he been running for office...

21:32.666 --> 21:36.159
yes, I probably would have come forward,
but come on, we all...

21:36.545 --> 21:38.957
all woke up one day
and he was in charge!

21:39.340 --> 21:42.207
What possible good
could it have done for me

21:42.343 --> 21:46.086
to confess something that...
that... it happened so long ago?

21:46.222 --> 21:49.886
Mom, you committed
a federal crime.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.555
It bought me 15 more years
with a wonderful man

21:54.563 --> 21:56.816
and gave my daughter her father.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.558
I'd do it again, 10 times over...

22:01.362 --> 22:04.354
because my family matters
more to me than anything else.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.157
[chatter]

22:13.207 --> 22:15.619
[Seth] The President will make some
remarks, and then introduce you.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.833
You'll read from
your prepared statement, okay?

22:17.962 --> 22:18.918
Okay.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.918
Don't be scared. I'll be
standing there right by your side.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.085
Yes, sir.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.424
Mike, stop.

22:34.728 --> 22:38.016
Change of plans. I would like you to
escort Mrs. Menez back to the Oval Office.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.809
I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.023
Yes, sir.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.313
-Sir?
-I can't do this. I'm sorry.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.856
Sir, the press is waiting for you.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.105
-She is mourning her dead husband.
-Sir...

22:47.241 --> 22:49.949
| am not gonna milk human tragedy
for political gain.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.239
| am not doing this. Handle it.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.620
| have 40 reporters out there.
What am I supposed to say?

22:59.628 --> 23:01.790
Don't ask me.
I'm the big-picture guy.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.629
There are so many connections
between our two countries,

23:08.846 --> 23:11.304
but the most important
is the human one.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.257
On behalf of the American people,

23:15.144 --> 23:17.636
| am so sorry for your tragic loss.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.685
-Thank you.
-I also want you to know

23:21.817 --> 23:23.728
that I am not gonna ask
anything else of you.

23:23.861 --> 23:27.024
There will be no press conference
and no expectations.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.818
You can say whatever you want
to whomever you want.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.908
That's what our country is about.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.863
If you don't mind,

23:36.999 --> 23:38.910
could you tell me something
about your husband?

23:40.044 --> 23:41.876
He was a good man.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.003
He cared about his family...

23:47.301 --> 23:49.338
-...and baseball.
-[chuckles]

23:49.470 --> 23:50.835
[chuckles]

23:50.971 --> 23:52.382
And tequila.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.504
[chuckles]

23:57.478 --> 23:59.060
You'd have liked him.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.929
It sounds like it.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.305
But, uh...

24:03.859 --> 24:08.319
the last three years,
there was no work,

24:08.447 --> 24:10.984
and he was so desperate.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.359
And then, last month,
he got that job as a driver,

24:15.704 --> 24:17.490
a very good job.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.074
So he just started working there?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.457
[voice breaking]
And he was so happy.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.748
It doesn't make any sense, you know?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.875
Oh, I'm sorry.
[sniffles]

24:31.887 --> 24:35.096
Mike, would you please escort
Mrs. Menez to the ladies room?

24:35.224 --> 24:36.385
[Mike] Yes, sir.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.884
Ma'am, could you
come with me, please?

24:43.899 --> 24:45.105
Thank you.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.770
-Mr. President?
-Emily, I want you to get me the name

24:50.906 --> 24:53.022
of the trucking company
that Mr. Menez worked for.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.023
Why, sir?

24:54.159 --> 24:56.901
I've got a feeling, and if I'm right,

24:57.037 --> 24:58.778
we might finally
have the leverage we need.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.656
Will do. There's someone from
the OMB here to talk to you.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.409
-Please get someone else to deal with it.
- I think you should, sir.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.503
It's about Penny, but I think you might
want to talk to your daughter first.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.666
Okay.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.585
Have someone bring her down.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.134
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.640
Thank you, Clive.
Little Pea, take a seat.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.855
You know that I trust you, right?

25:26.608 --> 25:27.769
Yeah.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.153
And you know that I think
honesty is the most important thing.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.442
Yeah.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.693
| need to ask you a question,

25:35.826 --> 25:38.534
and I want you to know
I'm not gonna be angry,

25:38.662 --> 25:39.948
no matter what your answer is.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.949
I'm sorry I broke your watch.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.955
You broke my watch?

25:48.172 --> 25:49.412
Yeah.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.294
Did you break this, too?

25:57.181 --> 25:58.592
No.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.431
You're absolutely sure?

26:00.559 --> 26:01.674
Yeah.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.802
Just your watch. Sorry.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.599
[chuckles]

26:08.984 --> 26:10.600
Come here.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.982
It's all right.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.154
Come on.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.991
Could you please take her
back up to the residency?

26:19.661 --> 26:21.993
-Bye, Little Pea.
-Bye, Daddy.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.706
-Mrs. Dunning.
-Mr. President.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.212
It's very nice to meet you.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.548
| want you to know that we take

26:38.680 --> 26:41.217
the destruction of property
very seriously around here.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.216
After all, we are simply caretakers

26:43.352 --> 26:45.969
obligated to protect what
belongs to the American people.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.436
| couldn't agree more, sir.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.894
Right. I talked to my daughter
about the vase,

26:51.026 --> 26:53.518
and she assured me
that she did not break it.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.531
| see.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.732
Respectfully, sir,

26:59.868 --> 27:04.658
it is my experience that children
tend to gild the lily.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.155
[chuckles]
Gild the lily.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.909
You know, fudge, and parents
want to believe the best.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.036
But sometimes,
we need to be a bit skeptical.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.962
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Dunning.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.384
[door opens, closes]

27:26.103 --> 27:27.889
Hey, sweetie. What did Daddy want?

27:28.021 --> 27:29.932
To talk. I didn't break a vase,

27:30.065 --> 27:32.477
but I'm not allowed to play
with his watches anymore.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.192
Oh. Okay.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.278
Mrs. Kirkman, do you have
a moment for Kendra Daynes?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.064
Sure.

27:42.870 --> 27:43.905
Sorry for intruding, ma'am,

27:44.037 --> 27:46.244
but I need to bring something
urgent to your attention.

27:46.373 --> 27:47.124
Okay.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.913
And I apologize for upsetting you
earlier. That was never our intention--

27:51.044 --> 27:52.455
No, no, no.
Kendra, please, just tell me.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.136
It's an FBI subpoena, ma'am.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.507
It's for your mother.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.731
Foerstel wants to question my mom.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.272
Closed-door hearing, penalty of perjury.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.314
We'll handle it.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.937
She won't.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.199
Tom, my mom didn't sign up for this.

28:23.327 --> 28:26.490
She's a very private person.
This will destroy her,

28:26.622 --> 28:30.035
not to mention what this kind of scandal
could do to the White House.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.498
Alex, Alex, stop.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.915
In the past year,
we were almost blown up,

28:35.047 --> 28:37.960
we survived a major conspiracy,
and I was shot.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.126
This is nothing.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.841
But, Tom, it's not nothing.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.222
It's a 30-year-old transgression
that your mom made

28:43.347 --> 28:46.806
in an effort to save her husband.
People will understand that.

28:46.934 --> 28:48.766
The rest is innuendo.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.137
We have weathered so much together.
We will weather this.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.933
[knock on door, door opens]

28:54.066 --> 28:56.603
Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but he's waiting in the Roosevelt Room.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.147
Alex, this is going to be okay.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.563
It's going to be okay.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.542
-Mr. Arronte.
-Mr. President. Ms. Rhodes.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.081
Transport Transnacional
is your company?

29:16.213 --> 29:17.578
One of them, yes.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.456
And you hired José Menez
just over three weeks ago?

29:20.592 --> 29:23.050
Uh, personally, no.
My head of human resources has--

29:23.178 --> 29:25.010
Mr. Arronte,
you're in the White House now.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.391
You don't get to come here
and insult my intelligence.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.677
Yes, I approved his hiring,
Mr. President.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.144
To run the border blockade,

29:34.273 --> 29:36.685
so you would have the upper hand
in negotiations,

29:36.817 --> 29:38.524
making you complicit in his death.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.861
The intention was not
for Mr. Menez to die.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.356
Right, because running
a blockade of truckers with guns

29:44.491 --> 29:46.107
is a smart way to ensure longevity.

29:46.243 --> 29:49.656
For the record, I didn't come
to Mr. Menez. He came to me.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.244
Dozens of my employees did.

29:51.373 --> 29:55.287
They wanted to fight your country's
unfair trade practices.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.537
A sacrifice for which I'm sure his family
will be handsomely rewarded.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.881
He did a patriotic act. I'll do mine
by supporting his loved ones.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.545
You signed his death warrant!

30:03.677 --> 30:04.712
No, sir!

30:04.845 --> 30:07.132
The American who killed him did that.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.221
Mr. Arronte, let me tell you
what's gonna happen here.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.306
You're gonna call your president
and you're gonna tell him

30:11.435 --> 30:14.268
that the deal we have here on the table
is fair and reasonable

30:14.396 --> 30:16.603
and he needs to sell it
to the Mexican people.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.689
-The American propo--
-I'm not finished yet.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.275
After he signs the deal,
you're gonna resign as trade envoy,

30:21.403 --> 30:23.110
or I'm gonna call
the Texas State Attorney

30:23.238 --> 30:26.230
and have you charged with manslaughter.
Do you understand that?

30:30.871 --> 30:32.737
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.910
Then you can show yourself out.

30:38.879 --> 30:42.122
-[door opens, closes]
-That gets us halfway there, sir.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.090
Get me Zalesky.
He'll take us the rest of the way.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.508
-Nadia, you can't let people use you.
-Use me?

30:50.640 --> 30:53.598
What, you didn't find it suspicious
that Senator Flores hired you

30:53.727 --> 30:56.139
just after the trade
negotiations were heating up?

30:56.271 --> 30:57.807
No, I didn't.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.270
Well, you should've.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.561
You need a little cynicism
to survive in this town.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.479
Aaron, the senator didn't recruit me.

31:03.612 --> 31:07.401
There was an opening, and I applied for
the job because I wanted to work for her.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.990
| don't care. Sending you
just to twist my arm like that--

31:10.118 --> 31:11.199
Was my idea!

31:11.328 --> 31:13.569
The senator didn't even know
| was related to you.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.571
I-1 find that very hard to believe.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.620
Well, it's true,
and if you had asked me,

31:18.752 --> 31:20.163
| would've told you.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.536
But instead, you assumed the worst.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.333
You went to my boss.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.459
You humiliated me.

31:32.140 --> 31:37.010
All right, I'm sorry, but the fact remains
you used our relationship

31:37.145 --> 31:39.432
to seek concessions
that make this deal harder to broker.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.272
"Concessions"?
Whose side do you think I'm on?

31:42.401 --> 31:43.311
Well, y-you tell me.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.435
Those concessions are for
36 million Mexican-Americans

31:46.571 --> 31:48.733
who don't see this
as a zero-sum game,

31:48.865 --> 31:51.857
people who have family
on the other side of the border.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.371
We have family
on the other side of the border!

31:54.496 --> 31:57.238
I'm aware of that. I'm as connected
to my heritage as anyone.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.583
Really? When was the last time
you were home?

32:00.710 --> 32:02.496
I've been a little busy, Nadia,
all right?

32:02.629 --> 32:03.790
| know!

32:04.965 --> 32:07.502
And we're all so proud.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.675
Look at you.

32:10.804 --> 32:14.342
Everything you've accomplished...
our Aaron...

32:14.975 --> 32:16.966
you've climbed
to the top of the ladder.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.677
But maybe you've forgotten

32:19.813 --> 32:21.770
who helped you build it.

32:25.527 --> 32:26.642
[door opens]

32:27.404 --> 32:28.610
[door closes]

32:28.738 --> 32:30.354
Paul, we're done haggling.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.653
The pendulum stops here.
Yes, Arronte was guilty,

32:33.785 --> 32:35.492
but there was plenty of guilt
to go around.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.453
We can't treat our neighbors as enemies.
We need to make deals with them.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.823
-Bad deals.
-Imperfect ones.

32:40.959 --> 32:45.453
But if everybody is so afraid of losing,
how on earth can anyone ever win?

32:47.048 --> 32:49.085
| will back you, sir...

32:50.719 --> 32:51.925
but you still have a problem.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.669
Okay, I'm listening.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.762
This thing is so compromised,

32:55.891 --> 32:57.882
neither side can embrace it.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.929
You can make this deal, yes,

33:00.061 --> 33:02.723
but it's eventually
gonna be unmade.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.564
What if I was able
to give both parties something

33:06.693 --> 33:08.400
without either side losing anything?

33:08.528 --> 33:10.235
Well, then, you'd have
a deal that might last,

33:10.363 --> 33:12.320
but how are you gonna do that?

33:12.449 --> 33:14.736
I'm gonna buy a friend dinner.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.514
-Are you live streaming?
-Excuse me?

33:39.643 --> 33:42.101
Your computer seems to have
a perfect view to the hallway.

33:42.229 --> 33:45.347
Yes, my nephew in Saginaw's
recovering from a broken leg,

33:45.482 --> 33:47.314
but Sammy's fascinated
with the White House,

33:47.442 --> 33:49.649
-so I like to do this for him.
-Is it always on?

33:49.778 --> 33:50.859
Yes.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.193
And how long
does the computer store video?

33:52.322 --> 33:54.438
| don't know.
A week, I guess?

33:54.574 --> 33:55.780
Am I in trouble?

33:57.953 --> 33:59.694
Not at all.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.158
How is it you're treating me to dinner,

34:06.294 --> 34:07.546
but I still feel like

34:07.671 --> 34:09.833
everyone's gonna wind up
dining out on me?

34:09.965 --> 34:12.002
[laughs]
For a smart guy,

34:12.132 --> 34:13.998
that's a pretty simple way
of looking at things.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.341
It is simple.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.007
You're asking me to slow the rollout
of my automated plants.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.516
To save jobs.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.007
You employ 50,000 people
on both sides of the border.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.306
Who get to stave off unemployment
for a few more years.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.849
How does that break your log jam?

34:26.982 --> 34:30.350
It helps both sides back the deal
without losing anything in the bargain.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.192
It nudges us across the finish line.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.822
And it costs me a fortune.

34:35.322 --> 34:38.657
I'll push for tax breaks, and you'll be
a hero south of the border.

34:38.784 --> 34:42.995
Mexico walked into the 21st century
as one of the world's greatest polluters.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.739
They want to change that record.

34:44.873 --> 34:47.161
It'd be a huge market
for your electric cars.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.284
[scoffs]
None of this will make me whole.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.583
In the short term, no,
but you're a privately owned company.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.706
You don't have to answer
to shareholders,

34:54.842 --> 34:56.299
and we both know you can afford it.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.045
Oh, I need a better reason than that.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.513
How about your president asked you?

35:03.977 --> 35:05.684
That's a better reason.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.519
The future's coming
whether you're ready or not, Tom.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.689
Now, you can try to hold back
the rushing water,

35:14.821 --> 35:17.779
but one day, the dam is gonna burst.

35:17.907 --> 35:19.159
| know.

35:20.994 --> 35:25.534
I'm just trying to buy time,
make sure everybody can swim.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.717
[Maya] Is this you?

35:43.850 --> 35:47.059
Uh, the camera adds 10 pounds,
but yes, yes.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.643
And why were you running?

35:48.772 --> 35:50.308
Well, it was almost midnight.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.101
| realized my exercise monitor

35:52.233 --> 35:53.894
showed 9,200 steps for the day.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.519
| had barely two minutes
to make 10,000.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.608
Our insurance covers negligence.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.452
It doesn't cover intentional
destruction of property.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.491
But your behavior here was reckless,

36:07.624 --> 36:09.331
which puts us squarely in a gray area.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.497
-How gray?
-It's a discretionary determination.

36:12.629 --> 36:13.960
| see.

36:14.089 --> 36:18.208
Is there anything I can do
to inform that discretion?

36:18.343 --> 36:19.299
Meaning what?

36:19.427 --> 36:24.263
How can I help you understand
that this was, in fact, an accident?

36:24.391 --> 36:27.349
-Are you trying to bribe me?
-Of course not. I'm--

36:29.437 --> 36:30.768
Right?

36:35.235 --> 36:39.194
| suppose further investigation could
shed some light on the incident.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.653
It would.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.693
A secondary questionnaire,
deposition, perhaps.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.658
You'll find me very forthcoming.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.447
Good.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.989
Let's discuss this further over dinner.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.832
-Dinner?
-Yes.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.507
-How much?
-For what?

37:01.636 --> 37:02.671
The vase. How much?

37:02.804 --> 37:04.795
It was last appraised
at $1.2 million.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.464
-[pen clatters]
-I'm gluten-free.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.682
-Great.
-[chuckles]

37:11.062 --> 37:11.972
Let's face the facts.

37:12.105 --> 37:14.688
This deal's the Kirkman compromise.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.523
Not a win-win. It's a lose-lose.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.358
[man] Well, maybe he should, uh...

37:18.486 --> 37:19.647
[Tom] Seth.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.191
Grab a beer. You deserve one.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.155
Oh, I'm good, thank you.

37:24.284 --> 37:27.447
And does anybody think the United States
won anything here?

37:27.579 --> 37:29.240
What's the temperature out there?

37:29.372 --> 37:30.783
[sighs]
Lukewarm, sir.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.748
| don't think that's a fair assessment.
The blockade's over,

37:33.877 --> 37:35.709
the country's not
hemorrhaging money anymore,

37:35.837 --> 37:37.703
and we hammered out
a crucial trade agreement.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.705
Despite incentives for both sides,

37:39.841 --> 37:42.879
this thing fell far short
of anything anyone wanted.

37:43.511 --> 37:47.254
Well, if no one's happy,
that's the mark of a good deal, sir.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.141
Then this was a great deal, Lyor.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.307
[indistinct conversations]

38:11.206 --> 38:13.538
[indistinct conversations]

38:20.548 --> 38:22.755
-Aaron!
-Sophia.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.251
Como estas?
Como estas?

38:27.931 --> 38:29.262
I'm glad you made it.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.094
I'm glad I made it.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.809
[man] Miralo!
Just in time for dinner!

38:33.937 --> 38:35.052
[laughs]

38:35.188 --> 38:36.929
[woman speaking Spanish]

38:39.692 --> 38:42.070
[speaking Spanish]

38:42.195 --> 38:43.356
Aaron.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.946
[chatter]

38:58.586 --> 39:01.078
You subpoenaed the First Lady's
mother after we spoke?

39:01.214 --> 39:02.545
-Hannah--
-Why did you do it?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.915
- I had to do it.
-You're such a bastard, John.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.633
I'm gonna give you a pass on that,

39:06.761 --> 39:09.924
"cause you and I go back a long way,
but it's a one-time pass.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.298
I'm the director of the FBI.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.641
You cross a line with me,
it's gonna stay crossed.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.558
| came to you in friendship
and in confidence!

39:18.690 --> 39:20.101
And I intended to honor
that confidence--

39:20.233 --> 39:22.349
Till when? Till your ambition
got the better of you?

39:22.485 --> 39:24.977
No. This did.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.325
Icarus Astrotech contract
with the Defense Department.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.284
For $3 billion.

39:33.413 --> 39:36.951
They landed it six months ago,
right after Lloyd's Pentagon hack,

39:37.083 --> 39:39.290
and the Icarus signatory is Eric Little,

39:39.419 --> 39:42.286
the guy who bribed
the First Lady's mother back in '87,

39:42.422 --> 39:43.662
the guy who just turned up dead.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.835
So I don't think I have
to tell you what this looks like,

39:45.967 --> 39:48.504
but I can tell you that I have
an obligation to investigate it,

39:48.636 --> 39:50.172
and I intend to do my job.
