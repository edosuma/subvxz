[man] Crow of Elysium, we honor thee!

00:47.798 --> 00:52.344
[all chanting] We honor thee!
We honor thee! We honor thee!

00:53.011 --> 00:56.181
[Crow] No mortal flame can
destroy common woe.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.767
Just one fire can conquer.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.605
Fire that burns in the fields of Elysium.

01:02.688 --> 01:06.024
[all chanting] Hail, brothers!
Many brothers!

01:07.067 --> 01:10.112
[man] Brothers many, make brothers one.

01:10.195 --> 01:14.742
Hail, fellowship!
Hail Crow in his verdant kingdom.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.410
Common woe, be done!

01:18.536 --> 01:21.539
[all chanting] Hail, brothers!
Common woe, be done!

01:21.624 --> 01:24.918
Set us free! Set us free!

01:25.002 --> 01:28.338
Set us free! Set us free! Set us free!

01:28.421 --> 01:29.547
[all applauding]

01:29.632 --> 01:30.966
[chanting continues]

01:40.475 --> 01:44.146
Yeah... look around.

01:44.229 --> 01:48.233
Some of the most powerful men in the world
are gathered in this clearing.

01:48.316 --> 01:52.237
Members of one of our country's
most exclusive clubs.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.699
Invitation only, unless, of course,
you invite yourself.

01:55.783 --> 02:00.913
They gather here to seek God between
the branches of these magnificent trees.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.874
They eat together,
they piss next to each other,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.669
and they carve up the world
like a Sunday roast.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.128
This is where the real power is.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.840
No women or presidents allowed.

02:11.924 --> 02:15.177
The former, I am not.
The latter, I will be again,

02:15.260 --> 02:21.016
because I have managed to reduce
a national election down to one state.

02:21.099 --> 02:26.021
And while these men here can't swing
the votes of an entire nation...

02:26.104 --> 02:27.981
one measly state?

02:29.066 --> 02:33.320
Well, that they can do.
And that's why I'm here.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.579
So welcome to Elysian Fields.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.726
[theme music playing]

04:38.445 --> 04:41.614
It's strange for you, isn't it?
Without him here.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.159
It's not strange, ma'am.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.372
LeAnn's in Cincinnati,
trying to close the deal for the debate.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.708
The president will make
a series of appearances across the state

04:51.792 --> 04:53.251
as soon as he gets back.

04:53.335 --> 04:56.463
If he survives the weekend. Anything?

04:56.546 --> 04:57.672
No phones allowed.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.508
Well, we're dividing and conquering.

05:00.592 --> 05:04.679
This Chinese trade agreement is going
to make Ohio voters very happy.

05:04.762 --> 05:05.889
It could help us win.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.766
-I didn't know the deal had closed.
-Well, we're on the verge.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.270
The president can make the announcement
in Canton when he appears.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.231
Oh, no, I'll be announcing myself...

05:14.314 --> 05:15.899
since I did the deal.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.278
Doug, you are very sincere...

05:20.946 --> 05:23.698
-and very loyal to Francis.
-And loyal to you, ma'am.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.158
I hope you know that.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.954
I don't mind it
if you call me Claire, you know.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.789
I'll show Ms. Davis in.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.839
Hi, Jane.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.176
Would you mind going over these numbers
with me before we meet with the minister?

05:43.260 --> 05:47.430
I have what China says they'll settle for,
and what I know they'll settle for.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.183
And listen, I want to thank you so much
for helping us with this.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.311
I'd like to see
an Underwood administration.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.897
Doug, that's all for now.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.150
Yes, ma'am.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.595
-You can show me.
-I don't want to.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.431
You don't have to protect me.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.186
Each of them has a story.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.480
Even if they got lost somewhere.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.153
It's harder to disappear
than you would think.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.531
But Rachel...

06:47.490 --> 06:48.783
is nowhere.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.706
[sighs]

06:59.002 --> 07:01.296
[Frank] I recognize that neck.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.925
Frank Underwood, as I live and breathe.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.555
Well, I owe you this.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.764
Oh.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.519
-He didn't expect you to show up.
-I'm always happy to see old friends.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.688
And make new ones. Frank Underwood.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.025
-Benjamin Grant.
-Oh, of Pollyhop. Of course.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.194
You're a big supporter of my opponent.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.948
He's a forward-thinking guy and a friend,
who should be president right now.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.617
There's no talking politics or business
while we're here, gentlemen.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.286
Yes, we don't want to poison
all this nature with words.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.371
[Raymond] You know the motto.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.041
Yes, "Buzzing bees, sting not here."
It's hard to miss.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.542
[Raymond] Ted, I think you know everybody.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.005
Common woe never stood a chance.
Mr. President.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.507
First time you've been invited,
I understand.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.469
I'm almost sure there's an insult
in there somewhere, General.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.847
You know, Ted and I just had
the most remarkable piece of red meat

07:52.930 --> 07:54.975
at a steak house out in Canton.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.727
I can't remember, do you like prime rib?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.522
-In the right company.
-[Raymond] Uh-huh.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.649
If you'll excuse us,

08:02.732 --> 08:06.778
Ted and I promised young Benjamin here
we'd find him an adult beverage.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.364
-Drink?
-I'd rather not.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.579
You know, everybody was looking forward
to spending some time with the general.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.248
And now you're here as well.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.043
After this weekend, who knows?

08:21.126 --> 08:24.629
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election
will get itself resolved.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.048
[chuckles]

08:26.131 --> 08:28.050
Oh, one little piece of advice

08:28.133 --> 08:30.218
that I could give you
as long as you're out here.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.764
If you don't bother the yellow jackets,
they won't bother you.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.690
So why didn't you invite Conway?

08:44.607 --> 08:47.194
Brockhart was invited instead.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.821
So there's not going to be
a debate next week, is there?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.531
Not a presidential one, no.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
I should really be in Ohio, shaking hands.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.370
Yeah, you bargained
to get in here, Francis,

08:57.454 --> 08:58.996
and now you're here.
So let me suggest something.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.207
Fuck Ohio.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.043
This is the campaign.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.672
The general is a traitor, you know that.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.841
The general is trying to be a politician.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.761
You would have done the same.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.515
Yeah, but better.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.145
-[knocking on door]
-[woman] <i>President Underwood?</i>

09:23.480 --> 09:27.024
President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am,
but you're needed in the Situation Room.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.702
[Claire] Cathy.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.081
I wanted a moment with you
before we join the rest of the team.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.708
-Oh, I was briefed on the way over.
-Not fully.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.128
A Russian research vessel
is stuck and sinking--

09:46.211 --> 09:49.089
Yes, they claim they were
taking core samples,

09:49.172 --> 09:50.923
some global warming nonsense.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.925
But they were looking for oil.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.221
There was a distress signal
and then all communication just shut down.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.767
We're the only country in position
to rescue. So, 20 minutes ago, we offered.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.561
-They declined?
-And denied.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.398
Petrov does not want us
to see what's on board.

10:08.191 --> 10:12.320
I understand this is a difficult decision,
but there are human lives at stake,

10:12.404 --> 10:13.905
and if help arrives,

10:13.988 --> 10:16.658
-Petrov will be forced to take it.
-Okay.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.827
Well, thank you. I need to speak
with President Petrov directly.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.708
A rescue at sea
and a chance to embarrass us?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.381
Just before your second Election Day?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.846
Sounds like I would be helping you, hmm?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.766
The boat sinks, your crew dies.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.601
How is that going to look at home?

10:43.685 --> 10:47.230
<i>I tell my people how things look,</i>
<i>and that's how they look.</i>

10:48.273 --> 10:49.982
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

10:50.733 --> 10:54.111
Wait a minute. Hmm.

10:54.196 --> 10:57.657
<i>-There. Do you like my face?</i>
-A beard doesn't suit you.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.033
[chuckles]

11:00.618 --> 11:03.663
I wonder how your citizens would feel
about what you've done.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.541
I could return your crew
to Russia, Viktor.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.710
You could return Aidan Macallan.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.214
Ah, I don't like to quantify
human worth...

11:14.299 --> 11:16.050
but Macallan's is higher.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.096
Social media is a powerful tool.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.890
<i>If there is any rescue attempt</i>
<i>by the United States,</i>

11:22.974 --> 11:26.394
<i>I will tell the people of Ohio</i>
<i>exactly how you look to them.</i>

11:26.478 --> 11:29.647
<i>Exactly how you disrupted</i>
<i>their state's vote.</i>

11:32.734 --> 11:34.486
<i>And they will believe me.</i>

11:36.863 --> 11:38.448
-Oppenheimer was a member.
-[urinating]

11:38.531 --> 11:39.574
That tree right over there,

11:39.657 --> 11:42.827
right under that tree,
Manhattan Project was born.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.080
And right under this one,
I'm relieving myself.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.835
I hope you're not equating me
to the atom bomb.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.923
What do you want? Cabinet position?

11:56.007 --> 11:57.759
-Frank Underwood--
-Judicial appointments?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.303
-Legislative support?
-Ah, buzzing bees, buzzing bees.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.431
Oh, right. Because the Manhattan Project
had absolutely nothing to do

12:03.515 --> 12:06.142
-with business or politics.
-I want you to breathe.

12:06.893 --> 12:11.188
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts
through the trees.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.694
Take this time, Francis,
to know your other attendees.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.614
Think about what kind of president
you really want to be.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.908
What am I supposed to do with that?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.702
Just... [breathes deeply]

12:26.329 --> 12:27.955
Oh, is that what you told the general?

12:28.665 --> 12:30.249
Insubordination.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.251
Clandestine coup.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.837
Oh, yes, that's the stuff
of real leadership.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.966
-People with money like uniforms.
-Mark, just tell me what they want.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.137
[indistinct chatter]

12:43.930 --> 12:44.931
They're waiting for you.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.955
[Raymond] You're up early, Mr. President.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.749
Always.

13:11.833 --> 13:17.589
Are you hungry? I have, uh, eggs,
and orange juice, mountain oysters.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.009
You mean bull's testicles, don't you?

13:22.093 --> 13:24.721
I prefer to call things what they are.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.933
Ah. [chuckles]
This is unexpected.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.938
I thought you'd stay out there campaigning
till your dying breath.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.524
What, and leave you out here all alone
in the wilderness

13:36.608 --> 13:38.776
to make all these important decisions?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.237
[chuckles]

13:41.320 --> 13:44.115
You've done well by me, Raymond.
I'd like your support.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.658
I've done well by your wife.

13:45.742 --> 13:50.121
Who happens, at this moment,
to rule the White House.

13:50.204 --> 13:54.083
Tell me you're not peddling influence
with your wife?

13:54.166 --> 13:58.295
Who, you mean the current
acting President of the United States?

13:58.380 --> 14:00.131
For the next two weeks.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.636
A little restraint?
Now, that... that would be unexpected.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.013
-[chuckles]
-How do you like your eggs?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.265
-In the afternoon.
-[chuckles]

14:09.348 --> 14:10.475
Good morning, Mr. President.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.395
Oh, no presidents here at Elysian Fields,
isn't that right?

14:14.562 --> 14:18.274
Only former ones...
[sighs] or future.

14:19.692 --> 14:24.489
Well, I won't call this politics, then.
Just current affairs.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.866
We had a real chance to get Ahmadi.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.701
Our campaign was briefed.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.746
I think a little more than just briefed.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.041
Do you have
an extra pair of socks, Raymond?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.709
After 30 years of military service,

14:36.793 --> 14:38.795
-you'd think I'd arrive prepared.
-[chuckles]

14:38.878 --> 14:41.923
Oh, I'm sure someone around here
could find you a pair.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.468
-Under my bunk.
-Thank you.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.308
He's a good man.

14:53.685 --> 14:58.523
Hard to find anybody
who distrusts or dislikes him.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.691
Hmm.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.361
So do you want eggs or not?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.544
With this rate of tariff, I'm confident
it'll have a mitigating effect

15:19.627 --> 15:21.212
on the anti-dumping cases.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.881
I think this is going to work.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.551
I'll need to run this by
my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.554
I think this is a very good day
for both of our countries.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.805
Yes, it is.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.390
There's an American on the boat.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.186
The Russian research vessel.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.356
-And how do you know that?
-Mr. Xu told me before you came in.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.236
I will need proof of that fact.

15:45.319 --> 15:49.991
Of course, but we are only telling you
because we know you'll want to rescue him.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.453
And China is willing to help
in any way we can.

15:55.287 --> 15:59.917
I'm just curious, Mr. Xu,
why are you so focused on this situation?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.630
For humanitarian reasons.

16:07.174 --> 16:11.721
Thank you for your time and cooperation,
Madam Acting President.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.268
[Davis sighs]

16:19.061 --> 16:21.105
[speaking Mandarin]

16:28.029 --> 16:29.280
It's contingent.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.117
The minister won't proceed
with our tariff deal

16:33.200 --> 16:36.245
if we don't give him assurances
that the rescue is underway.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.415
Why do the Chinese care so much
about what's on this Russian boat?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.085
I don't know. I was just informed myself.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.504
Are they working together?

16:44.587 --> 16:46.422
Again, I don't know.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.134
Are you working with them?

16:51.135 --> 16:53.220
I work with everybody.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.683
But that's beside the point.
There is an American on board.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.184
And you believe that?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.688
Well, you wouldn't want to make
the wrong call.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.984
Bull's balls.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.112
A giant crow.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.866
And billionaires chanting, "Set me free."

17:13.950 --> 17:17.453
Well, this place says everything I feel,
but can't express.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.166
He can't be your friend.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.837
Tusk doesn't have any friends.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.591
He's, uh, an associate.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.594
-Really?
-Mmm.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.929
And how does he associate with you?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.435
Oh, to hell with the buzzing bees.
No one else is heeding it.

17:41.518 --> 17:45.106
A network president, a telecom CEO,
the vice presidential candidate.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.149
What do you think
they're all talking about,

17:47.233 --> 17:49.944
-the last book they read?
-What are you reading?

17:52.363 --> 17:53.615
Your face...

17:54.531 --> 17:57.159
which tells me how much
you don't want to be here.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.999
Mr. Tusk was a major donor
on Will's campaign.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.502
Yes, so it's interesting
that he wasn't invited.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.923
We're partnering on a project.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.802
Large-scale data storage centers
in the desert.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.470
Solar-powered.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.722
[footsteps approaching]

18:19.015 --> 18:20.725
I need to get ready for my talk.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.728
"The Life After: What We Leave Behind."

18:25.062 --> 18:26.063
Hope you'll be there.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.112
Smell that.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.531
Cohiba.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.284
I know you're a fan.

18:39.410 --> 18:42.371
Even though I don't smoke anymore,
doesn't mean I can't--

18:42.454 --> 18:44.540
Who called this weekend's gathering? You?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.168
No. Tusk did.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.547
-Why?
-Hmm.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.260
[Morrison] We think the Chinese are right.
There is an American on board.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.722
This is Thad Peterson.
Retired two years ago.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.475
Director of geophysics research for
some of the country's top oil companies.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.394
[Dale] We strongly suspect
he's on board the boat.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.104
[Catherine] Working with the Russians.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.275
Where's the proof?

19:11.358 --> 19:13.277
This was sent
from a Russian sailor's cell phone

19:13.360 --> 19:15.237
before communications were cut off.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.073
[men yelling in Russian]

19:18.658 --> 19:21.285
[Peterson] <i>Get on the radio</i>
<i>and call for help!</i>

19:22.244 --> 19:25.998
[Dale] His wife confirmed that this is
Thad Peterson's voice on the recording.

19:26.082 --> 19:30.795
[Morrison] In 24, 36 hours tops,
that boat's gone.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.716
Yes, but that doesn't prove
that Thad Peterson was on the ship.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.471
[Morrison] But, ma'am...
he is an American--

19:40.554 --> 19:43.599
No, we can't be sure until
we have a passenger manifest.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.893
Let's reconvene when you know more.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.653
-What is it, Cathy?
-Your decision not to intervene.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.992
If an American is working illegally,
he will not be on the manifest--

20:01.075 --> 20:04.203
I haven't made a decision.
I'm waiting for more information.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.707
This is about Aidan Macallan.

20:09.083 --> 20:13.254
I am very confident China is lying
about an American being on board.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.506
There is something on that boat they want

20:15.589 --> 20:17.967
and I can't proceed
until I know what it is.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.262
They say they're motivated
by saving human lives.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.930
But that's not what's driving them.

20:23.848 --> 20:29.311
And I just find it so frustrating when
human life is treated with such disregard.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.898
[automated voice] <i>We're sorry.</i>

20:31.981 --> 20:35.943
[sighs] The proverbial walk in the woods
is not for me.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.738
Navel-gazing on some forest path.

20:38.821 --> 20:42.533
Contemplating mortality. Immortality.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.953
No. History is earned.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.455
You win the day,
and then you win the day after,

20:48.539 --> 20:51.000
and you do the same thing
every day until you're dead.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.921
And you're remembered not for the winning,
but because you never lost.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.173
Now...

20:58.841 --> 21:02.011
-[phone beeps]
-[line connects]

21:02.094 --> 21:03.262
Doug?

21:04.305 --> 21:05.722
Doug, can you hear me?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.350
I need some leverage out here right now.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.771
-What's going on?
-[Frank] <i>Conway is finished.</i>

21:11.854 --> 21:12.897
<i>If they win,</i>

21:12.980 --> 21:15.900
Brockhart will do all the heavy lifting.
He'll essentially be the president.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.526
<i>We should have used the oppo.</i>

21:17.609 --> 21:20.446
<i>Listen, Brockhart is Tusk's pick.</i>

21:20.529 --> 21:23.365
<i>I need to find a way to force</i>
<i>that old man to support me.</i>

21:23.449 --> 21:26.285
-Sir? Mr. President?
<i>-Do you hear me?</i>

21:26.368 --> 21:28.204
-[line clicks]
-[dial tone hums]

21:32.499 --> 21:34.543
-[phone vibrates]
-I'm here.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.589
Tusk has some deal with Pollyhop.
I need to find a way to stop that.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.174
An executive order--

21:40.257 --> 21:41.968
[grunts] Ah!

21:42.051 --> 21:43.677
[panting]

21:45.721 --> 21:46.722
<i>Sir?</i>

21:49.934 --> 21:51.352
A little restraint...

21:52.895 --> 21:54.521
would be unexpected.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.276
<i>Mr. President?</i>

21:59.360 --> 22:01.070
-Doug.
<i>-Sir?</i>

22:01.153 --> 22:02.321
<i>Don't do anything.</i>

22:03.239 --> 22:04.656
I don't understand.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.951
<i>Don't do anything until you hear from me.</i>

22:07.034 --> 22:10.454
-Sir, what about the Pollyhop deal?
<i>-Do you hear me?</i>

22:10.537 --> 22:12.832
<i>-Don't do anything--</i>
-Mr. President, I--

22:24.218 --> 22:27.763
-[Claire] Have you tried calling him back?
-There's no answer. What should we do?

22:27.846 --> 22:30.599
Nothing. That's what the president said,
so that's what we'll do.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.060
-Should we have his team pull him out?
-No. We wait.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.148
Ma'am... if we don't handle
this rescue correctly--

22:37.231 --> 22:38.065
Doug.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.526
Let me find a way to get the president
on the phone with Petrov.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.653
No. Francis doesn't need this distraction.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.779
I disagree.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.281
I know you do.

22:46.282 --> 22:49.368
[Benjamin] They say we're only
remembered for three generations.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.871
What would one have to do
not to be forgotten?

22:54.331 --> 22:56.292
Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.461
Who cares if he's never
heard of Johnny Carson?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.588
[all laugh]

23:01.672 --> 23:06.093
Poor old Tusk. He wears that game face,
but he doesn't fool me.

23:06.177 --> 23:10.139
The future terrifies him
because he knows it's short.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.766
For the record,
I have heard of Johnny Carson.

23:12.849 --> 23:13.684
Ah.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.436
[Benjamin] He tucked my parents
into bed every night.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.603
[all laugh]

23:20.607 --> 23:25.446
I've been given special permission
to show you what we've been working on.

23:25.529 --> 23:30.242
Imagine the possibility of your brain,
your consciousness,

23:30.326 --> 23:32.453
stored digitally in real time.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.663
I mean, what is immortality?

23:34.746 --> 23:38.292
In time, even Grant's vision will get old.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.296
It will happen, as it does for all of us.

23:42.379 --> 23:46.883
Now this is still in the early stages,
but we've been collecting and storing

23:46.968 --> 23:50.679
Raymond's memories,
thoughts, quirks and tics.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.475
This is a mock-up. But eventually...

23:58.312 --> 24:03.317
this Raymond... will feel as real
as the one standing before you.

24:04.235 --> 24:07.363
I like dirt and rocks...

24:09.698 --> 24:10.699
and facts.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.578
[Brockhart] No argument here.

24:14.661 --> 24:18.040
I trust only what I can hold in my hand
or see on my horizon.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.627
Well, but you can't just sit back
and admire the view.

24:21.710 --> 24:25.339
I've learned you've got to grab
the present by the balls.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.424
That's where the American people live.

24:27.508 --> 24:30.511
You sound more like a salesman
than a president, Mr. President.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.305
Well, if we're Americans,
then we are salesmen, right?

24:33.389 --> 24:37.684
That's our birthright.
Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.436
That's not how I see America.

24:40.354 --> 24:41.897
I'm a patriot. I serve.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.401
Well, then, we salute you, General.
But you serve to what purpose?

24:46.027 --> 24:48.237
So the rest of America can sell.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.906
I mean, you and I,
right now, this weekend,

24:50.989 --> 24:53.575
we're here at this camp selling ourselves.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.663
Character speaks for itself.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.415
People want a president they can trust.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.126
No, they don't.
They want a president they know.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.670
And I know them.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.632
The only future I'm interested in
is the next four years.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.677
So, yes, I'm selling tomorrow
and the day after that

25:11.760 --> 25:13.304
and the day after that.

25:13.387 --> 25:16.223
I'm selling a boy
who used to live on a peach farm

25:16.307 --> 25:18.350
who now lives in the White House.

25:18.434 --> 25:24.398
I'm selling a tomorrow that you can see
and touch and feel.

25:25.107 --> 25:29.111
Now, you take that away, and I don't know
what this country has left.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.613
Except a group of grown men

25:31.697 --> 25:35.659
standing around in a circle,
all staring at a small screen.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.911
Looking in instead of looking out.

25:37.994 --> 25:41.290
Heck, give me a peck of dirt
any day of the week.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.919
Hear, hear. To a peck of dirt.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.004
-[group] Hear, hear.
-I will drink to that,

25:48.089 --> 25:52.968
but I will also drink to the general,
a good servant.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.511
[all] To the general.

25:56.763 --> 26:00.351
[Davis] I promise you, this deal is
on the verge of falling apart.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.561
Right before your revote.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.896
I... I'm only the messenger, by the way.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.150
We can't let this deal fall apart.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.820
Agreed.
But the rescue has to happen immediately.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.740
You seem personally invested in this.

26:14.823 --> 26:18.119
Oh, no, no.
I'm just looking for a solution.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.623
I had a thought.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.752
I would be willing
to allow the Chinese sailors

26:26.835 --> 26:30.964
that are stationed on King George Island
to board our icebreaker.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.384
Then, purely for the in-house cameras,

26:33.467 --> 26:36.387
we let it appear as though
the Chinese led the rescue.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.472
Now, of course, the whole time,
the Americans

26:38.555 --> 26:40.224
would remain in charge of the boat,

26:40.307 --> 26:43.185
but the Russians don't need to know
our involvement.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.771
I imagine that would be acceptable.

26:47.523 --> 26:50.066
I'll relay this scenario
to Mr. Xu immediately.

26:50.151 --> 26:53.529
But I'd also like to round up
the tariff to 20%.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.366
We have a firm deal at 19.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.702
I know. But suddenly,
it just doesn't seem high enough.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.456
I think they'll be okay with it.

27:06.082 --> 27:09.044
Fingers crossed. I'll do my best.

27:09.127 --> 27:13.089
-That went rather well, I think.
-It did. It went very well.

27:13.174 --> 27:14.925
You've exceeded everyone's expectations,

27:15.008 --> 27:17.428
the way you handled yourself
all weekend, but...

27:17.511 --> 27:18.512
[inhales deeply]

27:22.558 --> 27:25.143
Brockhart's someone they can predict.

27:25.227 --> 27:28.939
Don't get ahead of yourself.
This is not over.

27:29.022 --> 27:31.483
What are you gonna do, Francis?
Are you gonna use the oppo?

27:31.567 --> 27:34.403
Well, it seems to have worried you enough.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.655
He's still only
the vice presidential candidate.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.241
[chuckles dryly] I'm leaving.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.536
-You don't have to go.
-No, I know. I don't have to do anything.

27:44.371 --> 27:48.417
Do you remember when we first met?
You almost joined my second campaign.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.044
We sat down at that little greasy spoon
in Gaffney.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.797
Yeah, if you'd signed me on,
you would have won by a landslide.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.301
I won anyway, because I never lose.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.387
You know why I didn't hire you back then?

28:00.471 --> 28:02.264
Because when you went
to pick up the check,

28:02.348 --> 28:04.850
you told me I didn't have to pay you.

28:04.933 --> 28:08.937
That you would work for free.
I don't trust that.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.022
Because no one works for free.

28:13.609 --> 28:17.321
[Xu over phone] <i>Madam President,</i>
<i>I'm afraid I can't agree to 20%.</i>

28:17.404 --> 28:20.324
<i>-The economic implications--</i>
-We're at an impasse.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.577
<i>I'm willing to keep</i>
<i>the conversation going,</i>

28:23.660 --> 28:26.788
<i>-but in the meantime--</i>
-We'll do nothing until you agree.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.000
<i>Madam President, people will die.</i>

28:30.083 --> 28:32.794
Which is why I'm surprised
you won't agree to my terms.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.755
<i>I can't agree to the terms</i>
<i>without the approval</i>

28:34.838 --> 28:37.424
<i>of my State Councillor</i>
<i>for Foreign Affairs.</i>

28:40.010 --> 28:43.889
There are 112 people aboard the vessel.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.225
113 if you count Mr. Peterson.

28:47.434 --> 28:51.021
Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.

28:51.104 --> 28:55.484
The temperature of the Southern Ocean
right now is 28 degrees Fahrenheit.

28:55.567 --> 29:01.282
A body will freeze to death
within 45 minutes in water that cold.

29:01.365 --> 29:04.743
And, of course, one loses
the ability to swim long before that.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.499
Minister Xu, are you still there?

29:13.252 --> 29:16.880
Collaborating with President Petrov
is always a mistake.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.841
The 20% tariff will help you
keep that in mind.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.177
I'm waiting.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.389
It's up to you if they live or die.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.982
-The crew?
-All rescued.

29:37.984 --> 29:41.029
-And Thad Peterson?
-You were right. The Chinese were lying.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.657
He's the only one still unaccounted for.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.912
The admiral says there's still a chance
to save the boat.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.585
Let it go down.

29:55.627 --> 29:59.465
-And whatever Petrov has on it?
-We're doing the right thing, Cathy.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.344
[Claire] <i>You got what you wanted, Viktor.</i>

30:03.427 --> 30:06.513
<i>The boat is gone.</i>
<i>Now let's get back to where we left off.</i>

30:07.013 --> 30:10.684
What will it take to get Aidan Macallan
back on American soil?

30:14.229 --> 30:15.564
He likes it here.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.705
[Benjamin] Leaving, Mr. President?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.168
You can put that in the car, thank you.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.257
-Are you all right?
-Better now.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.218
Are you drunk?

30:45.301 --> 30:48.138
-You want a pull?
-No.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.224
I hate this place.

30:51.808 --> 30:52.976
These men.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.855
Their privilege, their presumption.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.025
The deal with Tusk was a mistake.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.986
Do you know...

31:03.069 --> 31:06.322
[chuckles] Raymond wants to be frozen?

31:06.407 --> 31:09.451
Put on ice until a later date.

31:09.535 --> 31:13.079
-I have to get going.
-Will Conway's my friend. But...

31:13.163 --> 31:16.124
this won't end well for him if he wins.

31:16.207 --> 31:19.169
-You take care of yourself, Ben.
-[sighs]

31:19.753 --> 31:21.547
They have a recording of him.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.510
I'll be right there in a minute.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.897
You have to promise me

31:38.980 --> 31:42.401
Will Conway never finds out
this came from me.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.628
[Conway over recording] <i>You know</i>
<i>I'm gonna be the president, right?</i>

32:01.712 --> 32:04.339
[captain] <i>I hope so, sir.</i>
[Conway] <i>You hope so?</i>

32:04.423 --> 32:06.467
[captain] <i>I just mean</i>
<i>I'm pulling for you, sir.</i>

32:06.550 --> 32:07.843
[Conway] <i>I'm gonna be the president,</i>

32:07.926 --> 32:10.471
<i>and you're gonna flip me</i>
<i>those motherfucking controls--</i>

32:10.554 --> 32:11.555
[captain] <i>Sir!</i>

32:11.638 --> 32:13.890
I think this must have been
recorded by the pilot.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.101
[Doug on phone] <i>We should go</i>
<i>to MSNBC and CNN first.</i>

32:16.184 --> 32:18.479
-[Claire on phone] <i>We can go wide.</i>
-No, let's wait.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.108
Francis, you heard what I heard.

32:23.734 --> 32:25.611
And it'll be just as good tomorrow.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.071
Have Doyle confirm it.
I'll see you in the morning.

32:32.743 --> 32:35.203
-[sighs]
-Why not do it now?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.706
We need to wait for the president.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.584
[newscaster] <i>Stories are still swirling</i>

32:40.667 --> 32:43.962
<i>around the events leading up</i>
<i>to a daring Chinese-led rescue</i>

32:44.045 --> 32:45.547
<i>of the crew of a Russian research ship</i>

32:45.631 --> 32:49.510
<i>stuck in ice for almost four days</i>
<i>off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.</i>

32:49.593 --> 32:52.387
<i>Although the ship was lost,</i>
<i>every crew member was saved.</i>

32:52.471 --> 32:53.972
<i>Russian President Viktor Petrov</i>

32:54.055 --> 32:57.559
<i>expressed his gratitude</i>
<i>to the Chinese government this morning.</i>

32:59.728 --> 33:02.313
[newscaster] <i>Exhaustion must be</i>
<i>catching up with the candidates,</i>

33:02.397 --> 33:05.776
<i>as President Underwood</i>
<i>and his running mate took the weekend off.</i>

33:05.859 --> 33:09.237
<i>General Brockhart was nowhere to be seen,</i>
<i>while only Governor Conway</i>

33:09.320 --> 33:10.781
<i>-made a pair of quick appearances...</i>
-Hey.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.407
<i>...in the Cleveland area.</i>

33:16.537 --> 33:20.582
-That tap water is gonna kill you.
-[chuckles] There are worse ways to go.

33:23.794 --> 33:24.795
I have a confession.

33:28.882 --> 33:29.966
What'd you do?

33:33.094 --> 33:37.683
I've had somebody watch you sometimes
when you go to New York.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.397
Her name's Karen.

33:48.569 --> 33:49.778
Who is she?

33:52.405 --> 33:54.365
I don't know you get to ask that.

33:57.493 --> 33:58.787
She was my teacher.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.542
Theology, among other things.

34:06.461 --> 34:11.174
I don't know why I did that.
It's not... about jealousy.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.136
She saved my life, actually.

34:16.804 --> 34:17.889
I'm glad.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.063
Well, we won't be seeing Karen
for a while.

34:27.608 --> 34:31.277
She knows me.
She could see how I feel about you.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.786
Ma'am, an initialed agreement.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.876
What exactly was on that boat, Jane?

34:47.460 --> 34:51.922
Uh, the Chinese and the Russians had
access to technology they shouldn't have

34:52.007 --> 34:53.800
and didn't want to lose.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.342
And now they've lost it.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.096
What aren't you telling me?

35:01.057 --> 35:03.727
[sighs] What did you want
out of all of this?

35:04.645 --> 35:06.688
I told you what I wanted.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.440
I wanted that American off the boat.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.946
He was the technology.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.121
Here, give me that.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.457
Go.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.552
[phone rings]

35:39.971 --> 35:41.765
[into telephone] Tom Hammerschmidt.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.647
Detective, I got the drive.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.776
Uh, no, I just put it in.

35:54.402 --> 36:01.367
And... the time stamp says
November 3rd, 2013, 8:13 p.m.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.870
Hold on a second. You all right?

36:04.495 --> 36:07.290
Yeah. I just need to get out for a minute.

36:11.502 --> 36:12.503
I'm here.

36:13.421 --> 36:18.384
[stammering] I know. I know you're busy.
And I can't thank you enough, I...

36:20.261 --> 36:21.722
Let me back you up a bit.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.687
Okay, so this is two days before she died.

36:29.645 --> 36:32.482
The governor sounds unhinged.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.986
It bothers me, though.
It came too easy, don't you think?

36:36.069 --> 36:38.446
Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.782
I don't know, Claire.
You know these types of people.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.242
You should have been there.

36:42.325 --> 36:45.620
Why would they hand me--
He just handed me this. Why?

36:45.704 --> 36:47.789
When they've never wanted me,
not from the beginning,

36:47.873 --> 36:49.332
no matter what I do!

36:52.377 --> 36:55.213
-Fuck 'em.
-I intend to.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.759
And how do you intend to do that?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.888
I'm going back to work.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.767
I'm going back to work.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.730
We're glad you came.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.649
I hear those weekends can,
uh, take some recovery time.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.901
[chuckles]

37:15.984 --> 37:18.987
I must say, I didn't expect
to be back here so soon.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.449
Well, Mark, we asked you
back here because...

37:24.743 --> 37:27.913
we've come into possession
of a second audio recording

37:27.996 --> 37:30.165
of your candidate on an airplane.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.085
-He's been recorded saying--
-I know what he said.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.586
I was there.

37:39.632 --> 37:40.716
[scoffs]

37:41.717 --> 37:44.888
So, we were wondering
if we can discuss how...

37:46.431 --> 37:48.308
we might be able to work together.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.561
We can accomplish a great deal.
The three of us.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.063
Now, before you say anything,

37:53.146 --> 37:55.398
let me tell you
how this conversation's going to go.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.483
You're going to talk about party loyalty,

37:57.567 --> 38:00.611
and I'm going to talk about
how weak your candidates are

38:00.695 --> 38:02.280
and that you really have no choice.

38:02.363 --> 38:06.451
And then you're going to say
that your ticket can still win Ohio.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.871
And I'm going to say, "No, they can't."

38:09.955 --> 38:13.499
But what's going to go unsaid
in this conversation

38:13.583 --> 38:15.751
is that Claire and I...

38:16.377 --> 38:20.590
are willing... to do anything.

38:21.842 --> 38:26.762
And we know... that you are no different.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.194
[sighs]

38:45.490 --> 38:48.701
Okay, I can start by setting up
some meetings for both of you.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.870
I can't do that publicly, of course.

38:51.913 --> 38:56.667
I suggest you release
whatever you have slowly. One at a time.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.795
Let's make this build.

39:01.256 --> 39:02.257
Once it gets out,

39:02.340 --> 39:05.844
I'll make sure the Republicans don't come
to my candidate's defense.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.476
I was in a really bad place.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.314
I couldn't do anything.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.235
I couldn't leave my apartment.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.529
[Claire] Why?

39:25.530 --> 39:29.910
It's mysterious, isn't it,
when these things happen?

39:29.993 --> 39:31.953
Or maybe it never happened to you.

39:32.037 --> 39:35.206
But I woke up one day and it felt like...

39:36.917 --> 39:40.003
everything I contemplated doing,
everything,

39:40.086 --> 39:42.797
from going to the coffee shop...

39:42.881 --> 39:47.385
to... reading a book,
writing a chapter, it was just...

39:49.137 --> 39:50.555
laughable.

39:53.183 --> 39:54.225
[Claire] As in?

39:55.560 --> 39:58.479
As in... pointless.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.234
And Karen, bless her...

40:04.319 --> 40:07.488
she helped me find a point.
Or, not find one.

40:08.573 --> 40:11.659
Realize the possibility of one.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.664
Were you together?

40:16.747 --> 40:19.375
[chuckling] Yeah. We were married.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.504
For about three years.
A million years ago.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.133
She's a good person.

40:27.217 --> 40:31.262
She's just... having a hard time.
So I'm trying to help her.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.312
-Find a point?
-Mmm-hmm.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.315
[sighs]

40:43.274 --> 40:45.193
You ever been that dark?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.199
I wanna be with you.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.830
I love you.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.585
[whispers] I think I might love you, too.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.928
That's the script for the 30-second spot.

41:13.013 --> 41:14.180
We don't wanna hit him too hard.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.641
There's a risk of kicking him
while he's down.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.143
Who's doing the morning shows?

41:18.226 --> 41:22.105
Friends. They'll respectfully question
Conway's ability to serve.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.606
And then in the nightly news,

41:23.689 --> 41:26.526
we'll have veteran rights activists
arguing for better care.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.735
Good.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.571
Sir, the plan is
to go after the governor first,

41:30.655 --> 41:32.865
and when the general comes to his defense,

41:32.948 --> 41:35.660
we use his hot mic comments
to take him down, too.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.081
Congratulations, sir.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.042
I wanted to be the first to say it.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.086
We still have to campaign.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.798
Yeah, but you're going to win.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.218
We are, Doug.

41:54.304 --> 41:55.305
We are.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.718
Common woe, be done.
