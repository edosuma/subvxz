one thing.

03:10.258 --> 03:15.763
One thing for sure is that...

03:15.829 --> 03:17.865
I'm scared and you're not.

David put his hand in the bag,

I wish to report

04:29.870 --> 04:32.340
that I witnessed
a hit-and-run accident.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.742
The incident occurred at 1400.

04:34.808 --> 04:40.080
The victim was a white female,
approximately 30 years old.

04:40.147 --> 04:45.252
The vehicle which struck her
was a black Chevrolet cargo van.

04:45.353 --> 04:49.790
The license plate was 3JRQ158.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.859

- May I talk to you
one second?

05:42.543 --> 05:43.711
Yeah, what's up?

05:46.947 --> 05:50.584
This is a bit delicate,
but I've been advised
by the family,

05:50.651 --> 05:52.419
they'd prefer you not be here.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.721
I don't think
she had any family.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.789
Well,
her sister-in-law.

05:55.856 --> 06:00.494
Well, listen, we were really
close friends with her, so...

06:00.561 --> 06:01.838
- I'm very sorry.
- Well, we just...

06:01.862 --> 06:03.230
We just want to pay our respect.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.798
I've asked you both to leave.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.200
But, you know, I mean,
we were every bit as close...

06:07.267 --> 06:08.612
probably closer than
her sister there.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.638
I'd be happy to
escort you off personally.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.440
Please don't be fooled
by the collar.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.175
The problem is
you're asking too nicely.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.577
Get the fuck out of here.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.546
You make a practice
out of threatening people

06:18.612 --> 06:19.613
at your funerals?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.248
Hang on a second.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.316
You come see me sometime.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.118
It's my card.
It's a bar.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.621
A lot better place to
whip my ass than here,
okay?

06:27.688 --> 06:28.956
I want to talk to you.

06:31.525 --> 06:35.195
Hey.
Your Aunt Rachel
was a great person,

06:35.262 --> 06:36.797
and I'm sure your dad was, too.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.667
I didn't know him,
but I just want to say
I'm sorry.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.733
Please.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.536
Yeah, I get it.
Okay?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.081
He got held in contempt
on purpose.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.315
Yeah.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.662
I'm assuming
after what happened,

06:56.717 --> 06:59.086
that the contempt thing
will go away.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.287
Uh, don't count on it.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.122
The gnome is vindictive.

07:02.189 --> 07:06.126
And if Donald wants to
twist the knife into Billy...

07:06.193 --> 07:09.497
and believe me,
he wants to twist
the knife hard...

07:09.530 --> 07:10.931
then the gnome will let him.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.000
But if Mr. Cooperman
twists the knife,

07:13.066 --> 07:14.401
it's at his own peril,

07:14.502 --> 07:20.173
because the case
isn't quashed until
the contempt is vacated.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.944
Maybe I could, um...

07:24.011 --> 07:27.515
I could walk Mr. Cooperman
through the risks.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.818
If that would help.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.587
Ambitious girl.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.524
Good for you.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.893
Careful what you wish for.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.331
No, I enjoyed my time
as chief judge.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.933
It was no picnic, believe me.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.301
You're in a good place.
Don't worry.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.203
You're still young.
You've got time.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.073
I don't feel it most mornings.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.876
It's the state court.
Has some advantages.

07:55.943 --> 07:59.246
They assigned me
a beautiful, beautiful
renovated courtroom.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.321
Do you know my former law clerk,

08:08.388 --> 08:09.556
Judge Keller?

08:09.557 --> 08:10.924
Hello, Rosten.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.794
Your name came up the other day.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.764
Let me think, let me think.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.999
The Borns Tech case perhaps?

08:19.066 --> 08:21.569
No, it wasn't that.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.671
Let's see.

08:23.737 --> 08:27.975
It was the Senator Judiciary
Nomination Committee.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.310
Federal bench.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.312
So many positions.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.246
Shame congress won't fill them.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.854
One day.
[chuckling]

08:40.921 --> 08:42.255
Good to see you, Alex.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.457
Always a pleasure.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.760
Judge Keller.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.827
Sir.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.700
Not very subtle.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.037
You think I should
tell someone about that?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.472
Lawyers run into judges
all the time.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.741
It's not that unusual.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.275
But I heard he
never left his office.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.277
Rumors.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.346
Brilliant lawyer, that one.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.849
Odd man.

09:08.916 --> 09:12.419
Good one to know,
though, if you want to
move up in the world.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.754
Hm.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.925
Woman: All rise.

Rosten Keller presiding.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.765

09:26.266 --> 09:28.001
- Good morning, counsel.
- Good morning.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.305
Here we are again

09:32.372 --> 09:35.809
to determine if
Mr. McBride's behavior
toward this court,

09:35.876 --> 09:37.644
and specifically toward me,

09:37.645 --> 09:40.380
rises to the level of
criminal contempt.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.049
Mr. McBride,
please rise.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.185
To sentencing?
That's efficient.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.287
The court is aware of
the tragedy that occurred

09:47.354 --> 09:48.956
after our last proceeding.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.626
My sincere condolences
to both you and
your client's family.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.094
Thank you so much.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.996
The court is also
mindful of the fact

09:56.063 --> 09:59.066
that Mr. McBride
faces charges of drunk driving,

09:59.132 --> 10:00.968
and resisting arrest
in another courtroom.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.569
Yeah, good news travels fast.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.072
Would you like to
contribute to my
defense fund?

10:05.138 --> 10:08.008
In light of the circumstances,

10:08.075 --> 10:10.944
I've decided to vacate
my contempt finding.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.280
Well, that's very
compassionate of you,
your honor,

10:13.346 --> 10:16.516
but I'd like to have
my hearing just the same.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.319
I'd like to call
Donald Cooperman
to the stand, please.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.088
Hm.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.555
The contempt order is vacated.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.524
Any hearing would therefore
would be moot.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.626
Sorry, Mr. McBride.

10:26.694 --> 10:27.771
We're not playing
any games today.

10:27.795 --> 10:28.962
I don't have time.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.064
I... I think
you should make time.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.966
I'd like to redeem my good name

10:33.033 --> 10:35.903
in the same forum
where is was so
radically impugned.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.105
That's very clever.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.606
Seeking to use this proceeding

10:39.673 --> 10:41.574
as a means to dig up evidence

10:41.641 --> 10:43.576
in support of a baseless claim.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.445
The matter is adjourned.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.714
Don't be an asshole.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.454
The case is dismissed.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.190
I do wish you health,

10:57.257 --> 10:58.892
and happiness.

11:01.762 --> 11:04.998
I hope your nuts fall off,
you prick.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.108
What's up, Jason?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.477
Hey, I called your office
after the funeral.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.047
And the lady said that
you'd be here,

11:20.113 --> 11:22.015
or at the bar.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.951
Yeah. What's up, man?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.053
Well, my dad
didn't kill himself.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.822
And my Aunt Rachel said
that you knew that.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.757
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm not for sure,

11:30.758 --> 11:33.060
but I got my suspicions.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.627
Your Aunt Rachel
was pretty convinced

11:34.762 --> 11:36.229
he wouldn't
kill himself, either.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.899
What did... What did
your mom tell you?

11:38.966 --> 11:41.768
She won't talk about it.

11:41.769 --> 11:45.305
And if he was planning on
killing himself,

11:45.372 --> 11:46.907
he would have said goodbye.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.575
Or something.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.211
Is there any way
that we could
talk to you sometime,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.646
and your mother
wouldn't know about it?

11:53.781 --> 11:55.515
Yes.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.484
Yeah.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.786
Look, that's my card.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.790
There's a number on there.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.657
It's my number,
it's in handwriting.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.794
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.361
Don't show that card to anybody.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.105
What are you doing?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.941
You cannot talk to a child
without his mother present.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.710
No, you were talking to him.
I wasn't talking to him.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.046
And if anybody asks you,
that's the deal, okay?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.347
What?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.282
Trust me,
it's a good thing.
Come on.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.027
Patty: He's a kid.
He doesn't even
have capacity

12:31.051 --> 12:32.252
to bring a lawsuit.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.720
Billy: We'll file
an application

12:33.821 --> 12:35.455
for appointment as
guardian ad litem.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.724
You can be his lawyer
and get appointed by
the court.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.626
Oh, right, the mother's
gonna let that happen.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.061
It's not up to her.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.096
The court is never gonna
appoint me guardian,

12:43.163 --> 12:44.965
I have a conflict of interest.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.234
No, I have
a conflict of interest.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.168
You don't.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.837
And remember, we're not a firm.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.214
Yeah, but it doesn't matter
if we're...

12:51.238 --> 12:53.106
You know what?
You want to keep
arguing with me

12:53.173 --> 12:55.275
- all fuckin' day long,
because I can do it.
- Whoa.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.744
I am so goddamn tired
of you yappin',

12:57.845 --> 12:59.079
and fuckin' openin' your trap

12:59.146 --> 13:00.623
every fuckin' time
I have anything to say.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.083
- Take it easy.
- I'm not gonna
take it easy.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.193
I actually know what I'm doing.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.153
When are you gonna realize that?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.655
I'm gonna find out
what kind of dark ass shit's
goin' on here.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.558
We do have a dead friend.
Remember that?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.493
So you in or out?

13:27.607 --> 13:28.909
Hey, asshole.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.980
Remember me?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.983
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.326
Why don't you take
a swing at me?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.286
I'd love to sue you
for something.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.197
You're lucky
I didn't shoot you and
your fuckin' daughter.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.892
Hey, watch your goddamn
mouth about my daughter.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.560
Who put you up to that shit?

13:47.627 --> 13:48.895
Take a walk.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.330
You may be a fuckin' tough guy,

13:50.397 --> 13:51.598
but I'm a crazy guy.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.034
The difference is
crazy guys don't give up.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.768
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.370
So keep that in mind.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.906
I'll be waiting.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.373
I don't give up.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.505
[water running]

14:41.681 --> 14:43.616
Esperanza?

14:43.683 --> 14:46.486
Esperanza?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.787
What the hell?

14:47.854 --> 14:51.091
How'd you get in here?

14:51.158 --> 14:53.360
I told her I had permission.
Don't be mad at her.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.963
You look like shit.
What's goin' on?

14:55.996 --> 14:59.766
I went to a party, um, in Vegas.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.434
Private jet.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.003
I just got back.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.642
I did too much...
too much shit.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.448
- [groans]
- Sit down, sit down.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.484
I don't feel good.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.152
Yeah, I guess not.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.595
[sighs]
Goddamnit.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.936
Brittany, get up.
Come on, let's get up.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.771
- Brittany.
- Get off me.

16:11.838 --> 16:12.915
Don't be goin' to sleep, okay?

16:12.939 --> 16:14.707
I'm not sleeping.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.044
Well, get up.
Here, we're gonna
walk around a little bit.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.878
- Billy, get off of me.
- Come here, sweetie.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.413
Get up.
Goddamnit, get up.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.782
Get off.
Stop yelling at me.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.493
- [sighs]
- Just walk around
a minute, okay?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.519
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.054
Come on, let's go.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.256
Are you mad at me?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.757
No, I'm not mad at you, sweetie,

16:30.823 --> 16:32.292
I'm tryin' to help you, this...

16:32.359 --> 16:33.826
Please don't be mad at me.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.928
Just eat it all.
It'll help you.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.164
[sighs]

16:43.070 --> 16:44.204
[belching]

16:46.773 --> 16:49.742
Uh...

16:49.809 --> 16:52.745
Well, we almost got married.

16:52.812 --> 16:53.980
[chuckling]

16:54.081 --> 16:56.083
You what?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.285
- You got married?
- Forget it.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.089
Oh, shit.
Where's my purse?

17:02.122 --> 17:03.423
It's at the motel.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.625
Oh, God, I have, like,
$10,000 in there.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.960
Got it right here.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.896
You have the rest of my stuff?

17:09.962 --> 17:11.397
- Your stuff?
- The...

17:11.464 --> 17:12.974
- With the rest of my stuff?
- What, your lipstick?

17:12.999 --> 17:14.310
Yeah, I know what
you're talkin' about.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.694
There's not very much
of that left.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.770
That's why you're
in this shape. Remember?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.106
Like you're so perfect.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.508
You have a drink at this bar
three times a day.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.411
Well, how many times
have you had to fuckin',

17:24.477 --> 17:26.846
you know,
walk me over here to
eat a loaf of bread?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.915
I mean, I remember that.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.350
I can take care of myself.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.320
I'm just trying to make it work.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.688
All right,
like everybody does.
All right?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.126
Yeah, look,
I can maybe get some money,

17:39.192 --> 17:42.129
you know,
start someplace fresh, maybe.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.398
Why do you care anyway?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.600
I'm doing my job, right?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.237
Yeah, you're doin' your job.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.838
I'm not worried about your work,

17:51.904 --> 17:53.140
your work's fine.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.578
It's your personal life
I'm worried about,

17:58.645 --> 18:00.513
'cause I actually do care,
just so you know.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.683
I don't have
a personal life, Billy.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.156
I can't afford one.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.594
[clicker clicking]

18:14.661 --> 18:17.830
Callie:
Jason Larsen individually
and as successor and heir

18:17.897 --> 18:20.633
of Ryan Larsen versus
Borns Technology

18:20.700 --> 18:23.503
- complaint for damage...
- Okay, we can make this
go away

18:23.570 --> 18:25.972
for low six figures,
but you won't do it.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.174
Do you and I have an issue?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.741
I'm not aware of one.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.211
Then what is it going to take
for you to do your job,

18:31.278 --> 18:33.913
- and do what I say
about this case?
- [clicker clicking]

18:33.980 --> 18:35.548
Don't click at me!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.984
Continue, please.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.188
Jason Larsen, a minor,
herein alleges
the wrongful death

18:41.221 --> 18:43.290
of the decedent,
Ryan Larsen, his father,

18:43.356 --> 18:46.058
- as previously alleged...
- [clicker clicking]

18:46.193 --> 18:50.230
Blah, blah.
After that, it's basically
the same complaint.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.200
Old wine in a new bottle.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.203
The guy just keeps coming.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.904
You gotta admire his balls.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.906
Maybe you can do that.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.108
After hours.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.476
Enough of this bullshit.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.246
Where we are is...
and correct me if I'm wrong...

19:06.313 --> 19:08.381
we do not have to settle,

19:08.448 --> 19:11.351
because the statute of
limitations has expired.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.486
McBride is barred from
re-filing this at court.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.222
- Correct?
- [clicker clicking]

19:15.288 --> 19:17.290
[sighs]
Tell him.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.827
Statute of limitations
wouldn't apply to a minor.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.932
Fuck!

19:25.998 --> 19:28.935
♫♫

19:40.447 --> 19:42.315
- Behind you.
- Uh-huh.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.816
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.818
[indistinct chatter]

20:08.007 --> 20:09.476
Mr. McBride.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.121
You said I could
beat the shit out of you here

20:13.145 --> 20:15.482
without breaking decorum.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.250
This seems like an
orderly establishment.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.651
Sometimes.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.322
You complained to
the bishop about me.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.625
You said I was
preaching against
the virgin birth,

20:25.692 --> 20:29.596
that I called for
a crusade against Islam.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.498
Was that supposed to be funny?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.132
No.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.734
Got your attention, though.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.717
You know,
that wasn't cool of you

20:38.771 --> 20:42.309
to kick us out of
the funeral like that.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.011
I have a pretty good idea
as to what you're about.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.080
[chuckles]
Is that right?

20:48.147 --> 20:51.851
Well, I'm a far cry from you,
that's for sure.

20:51.918 --> 20:56.689
You're not just a priest.
You're one of the strict kind.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.425
At least that's what
Rachel said.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.837
She said her brother
went to your church

21:01.861 --> 21:04.464
because you're as
religious as it comes.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.770
Did he come to you
to confess his sins?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.574
That would be
none of your business.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.509
No priest would give
a Catholic burial

21:16.576 --> 21:18.845
to someone who'd
taken his own life.

21:21.848 --> 21:26.018
And the word is that
you've turned down
parishioners before.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.822
That you've denied funeral rites

21:29.889 --> 21:32.659
to people who have
committed suicide.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.727
But you buried Ryan Larsen.

21:36.162 --> 21:39.098
You gave him the whole big show.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.667
Would a good priest do that?

21:43.002 --> 21:46.539
A good priest
would never break
the confessional seal.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.241
So he did come to you
to confess.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.877
Have a good evening.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.112
Listen, Father,
I don't mean to be
an asshole,

21:53.179 --> 21:54.881
but it's part of my business.

21:56.583 --> 22:00.119
I'll sue you and
the Catholic Church
tomorrow.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.454
On what grounds?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.423
On the grounds that
I'm an asshole.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.558
And I'll depose
your bishop, too.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.738
As a matter of fact,
I'll track his girlfriend down,

22:09.762 --> 22:11.464
and fuck her if I have to.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.467
And I saw her picture
on Facebook, it's not good.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.704
Please don't make me fuck
the bishop's girlfriend.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.639
You are a despicable
human being.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.674
[chuckles]
Oh, given that,

22:21.741 --> 22:24.911
don't make me stoop to
what I'm capable of.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.722
None of this has to happen
if you just give me

22:26.746 --> 22:30.550
an honest and humble opinion.
Is that too much to ask?

22:30.617 --> 22:33.420
Can we not rely on our priests
to be honest anymore?

22:39.291 --> 22:42.294
You are what's wrong
with the world.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.432
You are greed and cynicism,

22:45.498 --> 22:49.936
and the mocking of
all that is good and just.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.471
I pity you.

22:59.278 --> 23:03.249
Man: What?!
California's bullshit.

23:03.315 --> 23:06.052
The only good thing
about California is
that shit.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.687
I'll put it to you this way.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.990
I always knew
I was comin' here,
and you know why?

23:11.057 --> 23:13.793
- Because you see
that shit right there?
- Yeah, I get that.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.463
That's the last
fuckin' frontier, dude.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.165
Right there.
California, man.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.534
California, buddy.

23:21.601 --> 23:25.538
Fuckin' Panorama City.
Fuckin' Downey.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.908
Fuckin' San Bernardino.
Fontana.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.177
Hell's Angels.
Where did the
Hell's Angels start?

23:31.243 --> 23:35.381
Not in fuckin' Oakland.
Fontana, California,
motherfucker.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.817
[laughing]

23:37.884 --> 23:39.919
That's good.
That's good.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.654
If a cat...
if a cat don't know ya,

23:41.721 --> 23:44.056
you throw a sinker
on the first pitch,

23:44.123 --> 23:47.927
- fuckin' thing's comin'
right down the fuckin' gut.
- Yep.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.930
It'll dip, but you throw it
for a strike, see.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.665
You got the motherfucker, okay?

23:52.732 --> 23:54.500
You know what Bob Gibson said?

23:54.501 --> 23:56.736
Bob Gibson, the greatest
fuckin' pitcher in history,

23:56.803 --> 23:58.571
you know what he said?

23:58.638 --> 24:02.074
He said,
"You know what my most
important pitch is?"

24:02.141 --> 24:03.576
"Strike one."

24:03.643 --> 24:05.812
- [laughing]
- Strike one.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.914
- [laughing]
- Right?

24:07.980 --> 24:11.150
Anyway, that's what I do,
I hide the ball pretty well.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.086
I look over at
this motherfucker again,
I come up...

24:14.153 --> 24:15.187
- Yep.
- Right?

24:15.254 --> 24:16.288
Yep.

24:16.355 --> 24:18.090
- Hell, yeah!
- Fuck, yes!

24:18.157 --> 24:20.102
- Did you see that catch,
fucker?
- Hell, yeah, man.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.294
- You saw that, didn't ya?
- Goddamn right.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.530
Goddamn right.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.766
The last fuckin' frontier, man.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.835
The last fuckin' frontier.

24:28.901 --> 24:31.804
Hey, where you goin', man?

24:31.871 --> 24:36.275
Hey, you better respect
fuckin' Mother Nature, man.

24:36.342 --> 24:38.578
She will bite you in the ass.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.046
Where are you goin'?

24:48.555 --> 24:50.657
[waves crashing]

24:53.225 --> 24:55.562
[distant siren]

25:02.401 --> 25:03.703
Seriously?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.675
What happened to you?

25:08.741 --> 25:11.010
I just needed a little exercise.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.260
What did I forget to do?

25:28.327 --> 25:29.962
I don't know.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.632
Help me with my history paper.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.601
Talk about colleges.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.869
Grab dinner.

25:38.805 --> 25:39.805
Hey.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.610
[sniffling]

25:45.444 --> 25:47.079
Come on in, sweetie.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.536
[knocking]

26:10.637 --> 26:12.138
Okay, come on.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.740
I'm so...
I didn't know that...

26:13.806 --> 26:15.407
- Hi.
- Yeah.

26:15.474 --> 26:16.709
- Is he breathing?
- Shh, shh.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.377
- Step outside.
- I'm so... no, no.

26:18.444 --> 26:19.946
You don't shush me, Lolita.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.281
Okay, look, look,
I don't know who you are,

26:22.348 --> 26:23.683
I don't know how old you are.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.652
Do not say the number.
Keep that to yourself.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.187
I have a real job, okay?

26:28.254 --> 26:30.422
I need him to do my job, okay?

26:30.489 --> 26:33.125
So whatever sex charades
you guys are playin'...

26:33.192 --> 26:34.794
I'm his daughter.

26:34.861 --> 26:38.264
- Man.
- I'm Billy's daughter
Denise.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.099
[sighs]

26:40.166 --> 26:41.433
Hi.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.170
I'm... I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.236
I work with your dad.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.472
Are you Brittany?

26:46.538 --> 26:48.340
I'm absolutely not Brittany, no.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.342
I'm Patty.
I'm the... I'm the...

26:50.409 --> 26:51.678
I'm the actual lawyer.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.245
Um, which is why I'm here,

26:53.312 --> 26:55.481
uh, because we have
a very big day tomorrow.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.918
I don't know if your...
if your daddy, uh,
told you about it,

26:58.985 --> 27:01.087
but we have a very big
court day tomorrow,

27:01.153 --> 27:03.589
in which I have to talk.
[chuckles]

27:03.690 --> 27:06.358
Uh, so, I... I'm not...
Two seconds.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.670
- I will go two...
- Oh, you know what?

27:07.694 --> 27:09.695
Actually, he mentioned you.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.206
- No, he...
- He did, he mentioned you.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.165
- Oh, great.
- He said you were great.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.301
Actually, he said
you were a natural.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.303
And that you were gonna
kill it tomorrow.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.374
Kill it in a bad...
Kill it in a bad way or
kill it in a good way?

27:22.441 --> 27:23.843
No, he just said kill it.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.378
- Right.
- Which is a good thing.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.445
Swear to God.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.418
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna be great.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.853
Tomorrow.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.390
It was a pleasure to meet you.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.092
- You, too.
- Yes.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.260
Okay.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.864
- Take care.
- You take care.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.198
You take care twice,

27:46.265 --> 27:48.334
because you made my night.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.337
♫♫

28:13.392 --> 28:15.962
You know what?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.930
I'm really proud of you.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.632
Standing up for
what you believe in.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.335
No matter what.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.771
Dad didn't kill himself.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.408
I wish he hadn't.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.044
But he did.

28:32.111 --> 28:36.215
And I would not
lie to you about that.

28:36.282 --> 28:40.519
He was so sad
for so long, and...

28:40.586 --> 28:43.923
just hated what he did.

28:46.258 --> 28:49.128
Hated what he was.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.897
And he didn't want to get help.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.474
If I ask you to drop this case,

29:02.541 --> 29:03.810
would you?

29:06.813 --> 29:08.180
Would you, for me?

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
No.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.293
It's repulsive, your honor,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.830
for Mr. McBride to be
saddling up a child

29:23.863 --> 29:26.698
for the purpose of
end-running standing, it's...

29:26.833 --> 29:28.500
Oh, bullshit,
the child came to us.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.567
And that makes it okay?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.838
Uh, no, but it makes it legal

29:31.871 --> 29:33.372
because the child
has standing to sue,

29:33.439 --> 29:36.742
and that's the law.
I didn't make that up.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.177
The California Supreme Court

29:38.244 --> 29:41.080
has expressly held that
parental choice

29:41.147 --> 29:42.648
is the foundation of family law,

29:42.714 --> 29:45.217
and that parents have
the right to protect
their children

29:45.284 --> 29:47.019
from the unscrupulous behavior

29:47.086 --> 29:48.854
of predatory attorneys.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.923
Oh, objection.
Come on.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.059
I mean, it ain't ironclad,

29:53.125 --> 29:54.861
and there are
plenty of exceptions.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.898
Yes, if the child
is being abused or neglected,

29:58.965 --> 30:00.199
and this is not that.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.168
No, this involves
a conflict of interest

30:02.234 --> 30:04.170
between a mother and her child.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.073
The mother has
made a settlement and
doesn't want to sue,

30:07.139 --> 30:08.683
and the child wants to
find out the truth

30:08.707 --> 30:10.242
about what happened
to his father.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.279
Now, the court has said
that in a case like this,

30:13.345 --> 30:16.182
a guardian ad litem lawyer
has to be appointed

30:16.248 --> 30:18.117
to represent
the best interest
of the child,

30:18.184 --> 30:21.287
and again, not making this up.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.023
Ms. Papalian,

30:24.090 --> 30:26.926
have you ever served as
a guardian ad litem before?

30:26.993 --> 30:29.361
Papagian.
Uh, no, your honor,

30:29.428 --> 30:32.164
but code section 3-7-2
is pretty clear

30:32.231 --> 30:36.002
that if appointed,
I would hire Mr. McBride
to pursue the case

30:36.068 --> 30:37.669
which he's already started.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.906
Your honor, if I may.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.708
Ms. Papagian is
a recent graduate

30:42.774 --> 30:45.144
of LaVerne Law School
evening track,

30:45.211 --> 30:48.714
and a friend of the late
Rachel Kennedy,

30:48.780 --> 30:51.050
and I believe she introduced

30:51.117 --> 30:52.919
the initial case
to Mr. McBride.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.922
The conflict of interest
is astonishing.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.657
Your honor,
if she says my name,
may I respond, please?

30:58.724 --> 30:59.458
No.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.927
Okay. I see.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.929
Young man, please rise.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.102
You met Ms. Papagian...
[clears throat]

31:10.169 --> 31:13.605
and it is your wish
that she be appointed

31:13.672 --> 31:16.008
as your guardian?

31:16.075 --> 31:17.609
Yes, your honor.

31:17.676 --> 31:18.676
What grade are you in?

31:18.710 --> 31:19.745
Ninth.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.447
Ninth.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.016
You a good student?
Get good report cards?

31:24.083 --> 31:26.018
Yeah. Straight A's.

31:26.085 --> 31:29.755
My dad was an engineer,
and I do really well in math.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.090
Who do you want for president?

31:35.361 --> 31:39.731
Well, who do you want
for president?

31:39.798 --> 31:41.333
'Cause I think they all suck.

31:50.276 --> 31:54.046
Ms. Papagian is
appointed guardian.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.015
A guardian may choose
the lawyer she believes

31:56.082 --> 31:57.883
has the best interest
of the child in mind,

31:57.984 --> 32:01.988
therefore, Mr. McBride
is appointed to handle
Jason's lawsuit.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.090
And we are adjourned.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.993
I'll see counsel
in chambers, please.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.999
I'm assuming we are all here.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.102
First of all,
well done, Mr. McBride.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.303
Thank you, your honor.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.571
You're nothing if not dogged.

32:19.638 --> 32:23.809
I'm hereby designating
this matter as complex.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.445
So, we will be dispensing with

32:26.512 --> 32:27.913
conventional rules of discovery.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.181
What are you talking about?

32:29.248 --> 32:30.682
The complex case program.

32:30.749 --> 32:33.119
It's been around since 1996.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.687
When a case is considered
too complicated

32:35.754 --> 32:37.256
for a lay jury to understand,

32:37.323 --> 32:40.892
it is deferred to a
complex litigation manager,

32:41.027 --> 32:42.661
which I happen to be.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.296
Oh.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.565
The matter is expedited,
and you won't have to wait

32:46.632 --> 32:49.501
the five plus years
to see this through.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.670
Well, the fact that
they're not objecting

32:51.737 --> 32:53.039
kind of gives me pause.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.807
Streamlined.
It doesn't appeal to you?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.876
Oh, yeah, streamline
appeals to me.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.945
Uh, ramrodded, not so much.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.448
Give me your bottom line figure.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.050
What will it take
to make it go away?

33:05.051 --> 33:07.486
And, look, don't be stupid.

33:07.553 --> 33:11.157
Okay. $5 million.

33:12.958 --> 33:16.595
Miss Senate.
I'll chip that to 1.2.
What say you?

33:16.662 --> 33:21.233
We're not settling.
Borns Tech neither caused
Mr. Larsen's death,

33:21.300 --> 33:22.401
nor lied about it so...

33:22.468 --> 33:24.236
That is really terrific news.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.138
If this thing goes
the trial route,

33:26.205 --> 33:28.807
you're looking at defense costs
in excess of $3 million,

33:28.874 --> 33:30.742
why not be done today
for half the price?

33:30.809 --> 33:33.745
We offer nothing.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.447
Nothing. Really?

33:36.615 --> 33:39.118
How do you feel
about that, Mr. Letts?

33:39.185 --> 33:40.786
Listen, I'd imagine
you enjoy being

33:40.852 --> 33:42.488
general counsel at Borns Tech.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.123
- Mm-hm.
- You make, what,

33:44.190 --> 33:45.430
with stock options, $2 million?

33:45.457 --> 33:47.526
You might consider
doing your job

33:47.593 --> 33:50.262
should you be inclined
to keep it.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.103
He has a dead man and his son.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.408
- 300,000.
- Your honor,

34:02.474 --> 34:04.086
can I have a moment
to speak to my client,
please?

34:04.110 --> 34:07.479
Payable today.
Waivers on all claims.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.681
Confidentiality agreement
with penalties.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.683
- Leonard.
- Nah.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.753
- Wait, no, no.
- No, don't talk.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.422
Okay, I'll up it to 500.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.125
Five's acceptable.
I can do five.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.859
So you can make that decision?

34:20.926 --> 34:24.130
You can go up that high
without running it past
anybody or anything?

34:24.163 --> 34:26.331
- Yes.
- Wow.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.600
Well, that's a whole different
kettle of fish there.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.001
Fuck no.

34:30.136 --> 34:33.438
Your honor, I'm sorry,
can I have a moment with
my colleague?

34:33.505 --> 34:36.842
- Please.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

34:36.908 --> 34:41.480
[whispering]
Um, take the
motherfucking deal.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.150
- No.
- Yes.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.585
So you're working freelance now?

34:47.652 --> 34:50.621
Because Wendell Corey
and Cooperman made it
very clear

34:50.688 --> 34:51.556
that we're not settling.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.659
I'm the fucking general counsel.

34:56.395 --> 35:00.366
- The offer's 500,000.
- And the offer is rejected.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.672
I am offering both sides
the opportunity to blink.

35:13.078 --> 35:15.181
Okay.

35:15.214 --> 35:18.083
Here's how it's
gonna go from here.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.685
We'll reconvene tomorrow.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.287
Yet again.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.688
You make me an offer of proof

35:22.754 --> 35:24.656
that rises considerably above

35:24.723 --> 35:26.692
this piece of shit complaint

35:26.758 --> 35:29.995
or I dismiss your
cause of action altogether.

35:30.061 --> 35:33.299
Now, I suppose you think
I can't do that.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.635
Jesus, you blew off
half a million dollars.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.946
- A half a million dollars...
- I mean, do you know
how fucked up that is?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.090
That's not shit to these guys.
Do you understand that?

35:41.207 --> 35:42.073
They're flippin' us a nickel.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.342
God.

35:43.409 --> 35:44.419
There's a hell of a lot
more to it

35:44.443 --> 35:45.577
than a half million dollars.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.214
They're hiding
something big here.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.482
There's no fucking
question about it.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.659
Don't you want to do this
for Rachel and the kid?

35:51.683 --> 35:53.219
You want to find out the truth?

35:53.285 --> 35:54.853
Oh, like you're so
fucking principled.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.499
I got a whole bag
full of tricks,

37:13.565 --> 37:16.201
extortion, blackmail,
all kinds of shit.

37:16.302 --> 37:17.569
Whatever it takes.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.740
Why don't you just
tell me what you know,

37:21.807 --> 37:23.442
and I'll be nice.

37:23.509 --> 37:26.378
I might even help you
with your immigration issues.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.179
What immigration issues?

37:28.314 --> 37:30.315
The ones that'll come up
if I tell the police

37:30.316 --> 37:32.318
that Gabriel's
blowing seals up again.

37:36.688 --> 37:40.692
Man. I ain't sayin' shit
'cause I don't know shit.

37:41.527 --> 37:44.496
All I know is what I saw.

37:51.069 --> 37:52.604
[explosions]

37:52.671 --> 37:55.907
Shit.
He took that
with his phone?

37:55.974 --> 37:57.343
Yeah, from a distance.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.177
Are they terrorists?

37:59.244 --> 38:01.747
I read once they
clamped down on
the Somali pirates,

38:01.813 --> 38:04.349
a lot of them ended up
here as fishermen.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.918
Marva, could you give us
a minute, please?

38:06.985 --> 38:08.554
Certainly.

38:08.620 --> 38:11.957
The Marquez boys told me
that this rained down on them
after the explosion,

38:12.023 --> 38:14.860
but, uh, it's not
the same kind of plastic
you'd get from a boat.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.628
Where's it from?

38:16.695 --> 38:19.431
I don't know.
We're gonna have to hire
an explosives expert.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.999
Who pays for that?

38:21.066 --> 38:24.536
How's that list of ex
Borns Tech employees going?

38:24.603 --> 38:27.573
Here is a list of former
Borns Tech engineers,

38:27.639 --> 38:30.376
who are registered
for the job expo.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.777
What job expo is that?

38:31.843 --> 38:34.045
Oh, the one I advertised online.

38:34.112 --> 38:37.683
It's totally free.
You just say that you're
a start up sub contractor

38:37.749 --> 38:39.217
interested in hiring somebody

38:39.284 --> 38:41.487
who has a background
in aerospace

38:41.553 --> 38:43.021
or military projects,

38:43.088 --> 38:45.457
preferably somebody with
experience at Borns Tech,

38:45.524 --> 38:47.058
and they send you
a list of names.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.560
Oh, I highlighted the ones there

38:48.627 --> 38:50.862
that left under
questionable circumstances.

38:50.929 --> 38:54.566
You know how
grumpy former employees
tend to be Chatty Cathys.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.668
- And you came up with this.
- I did.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.269
That's pretty impressive.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.105
Thank you.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.574
Okay. So, Brittany,
get an IT guy

39:02.641 --> 39:03.909
to blow these images up,

39:03.975 --> 39:05.687
and then all three of you
go through this list,

39:05.711 --> 39:07.979
and find somebody that
knows what this shit is.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.657
You don't think the video
would be enough?

39:09.681 --> 39:11.950
With this judge?
No, I don't.

39:13.318 --> 39:16.087
Letts: Look, I did what
any good lawyer would do.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.689
We can afford to settle this.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.458
No, Leonard, we cannot.

39:19.525 --> 39:23.028
You know what
the biggest lie in
American history is?

39:23.094 --> 39:26.598
That if Richard Nixon
had just admitted
what he did,

39:26.665 --> 39:29.768
he wouldn't have had to resign.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.603
That's bullshit.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.805
If he'd told the truth
about Watergate,

39:33.872 --> 39:36.608
they'd have just
kept on digging.

39:36.675 --> 39:40.546
He'd have gone
to prison or worse.

39:40.612 --> 39:42.714
What are you
not telling me, Wendell?

39:42.781 --> 39:44.516
What the hell is going on here?

39:46.818 --> 39:48.162
Now, I took this job
on the promise that

39:48.186 --> 39:49.855
there were no issues here.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.925
I moved my family here.
Now you're telling me
there are issues.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.498
Leonard, there are
always issues.

39:59.565 --> 40:03.101
And I've been trying to
protect you from them,
but you won't let me.

40:03.168 --> 40:06.171
And there's not
enough money in the world

40:06.237 --> 40:09.174
to settle this case.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.744
So just make sure
it goes the hell away.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.692
Hey.
Case over?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.326
No.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.562
Judge designated it complex.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.932
[chuckles]
Billy needs to make a
compelling offer of proof

40:33.999 --> 40:36.568
by tomorrow,
which should be difficult.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.136
It'll probably go away.

40:38.203 --> 40:41.607
Although, clearly,
your ex husband
is not about to.

40:41.673 --> 40:42.874
I tried to tell you that.

40:44.109 --> 40:47.278
Listen, if this case
survives tomorrow,

40:47.345 --> 40:50.181
and it shouldn't,
but if it does,

40:50.248 --> 40:53.985
my marching orders
are not gonna be to
merely argue the case.

40:54.052 --> 40:57.523
They are going to be to
destroy the man bringing it.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.290
And I...

40:59.357 --> 41:00.792
I don't want to pretend to you

41:00.859 --> 41:03.762
that it's not gonna get ugly.

41:03.829 --> 41:07.232
I hear ya,
but has it not
gotten ugly already?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.400
The last plaintiff is dead.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.536
Don't be ridiculous.

41:11.537 --> 41:13.539
That was an accident.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.306
I know.
I checked with the LAPD,

41:15.373 --> 41:17.843
they said they had
a couple of tips,
but no real leads.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.678
You checked?

41:20.311 --> 41:21.613
I was curious.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.982
Billy's making you crazy again.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.551
- Come on.
- This is what happens.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.253
Whenever you spend
any length of time with him,

41:28.319 --> 41:30.121
you catch his crazy.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.657
It's true.

41:31.723 --> 41:34.993
Can I ask you a question?

41:35.060 --> 41:38.229
Why do you think
that you were selected
for this case?

41:39.598 --> 41:41.032
You'd have to ask Cooperman.

41:41.099 --> 41:43.802
No, I'm asking you.

41:43.869 --> 41:48.840
Donald clearly thinks you
match up well against Billy.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.876
Do you two match up well?

41:50.942 --> 41:52.177
What?

41:52.243 --> 41:54.179
Well, I didn't fuck him,
if that's what you mean.

41:54.245 --> 41:57.115
No, that's not... What?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.284
Jesus Christ.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.752
You know, after all these years,

42:00.819 --> 42:02.854
after everything
he put you through,

42:02.921 --> 42:05.791
you are still obsessed with him.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.325
- Hey...
- It's just sad.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.760
I did not mean to offend you.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.696
- [sighs]
- Callie...

42:10.762 --> 42:13.298
You know, not everyone
who meets him

42:13.364 --> 42:14.600
wants to fuck him.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.067
That's your problem, Michelle.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.303
And I tell you this
as your friend.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.905
Get over it.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.477
We're... we're seeking out
Borns Tech personnel,

42:26.612 --> 42:31.016
because they
pre-qualify for, uh...
for security clearances.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.084
Yes, we manufacture components

42:33.151 --> 42:35.954
for small private
weapons companies.

42:36.021 --> 42:39.524
Uh, lasers.
Directional components.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.059
It is for a management position.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.494
It's for a
senior management
mid level.

42:43.629 --> 42:44.839
Well, I know it's a big company,

42:44.863 --> 42:46.183
but, uh, the older
white engineers

42:46.231 --> 42:48.466
tend to stick together
in cliques, right?

42:48.533 --> 42:52.738
We're looking for people
specialized in flight based
classified patents.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.472
Yes, health insurance
is included.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.007
Yep, we have dental.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.985
You want to bring your pet,
you can bring your pet.

42:58.009 --> 43:02.313
Oh, I love a missile man.
[chuckles]

43:02.380 --> 43:05.751
♫♫[rock]

43:07.085 --> 43:09.220
- Hey, guess what.
- What's up? What?

43:09.287 --> 43:10.321
I think we found our guy.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.157
- Really?
- Yep.

43:12.223 --> 43:15.460
He lives out in Reseda,
and he sounds really good
on the phone.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.028
Well, let's go.

43:17.095 --> 43:17.929
Now?

43:17.996 --> 43:19.698
Of course now.
You heard the judge.

43:19.765 --> 43:21.275
If we don't have
something tomorrow,
we're fucked,

43:21.299 --> 43:23.534
so let's go.
Come on.

43:23.669 --> 43:26.071
Man.

43:26.137 --> 43:28.306
I inherited the place
from my folks,

43:28.373 --> 43:30.842
so there's no mortgage,
but there's upkeep,

43:30.909 --> 43:32.349
so there's cost.
Kind of a money pit.

43:32.377 --> 43:33.737
Did you want ice?
I don't have any.

43:33.779 --> 43:36.047
- No, I'm good.
- Thank you.

43:44.455 --> 43:48.293
So, I'm getting that
this isn't really about
a job interview.

43:48.359 --> 43:49.728
I'm an intuitive person.

43:49.795 --> 43:52.363
You're not really here
to hire me, are you?

43:52.430 --> 43:53.699
- Well...
- No.

43:53.765 --> 43:57.903
Uh, we're liars by trade,
we practice law.

43:59.370 --> 44:01.506
- This about Borns Tech?
- Billy: Yes, sir.

44:01.572 --> 44:03.441
Patty:
Which... which I said
over the phone.

44:03.508 --> 44:05.977
Remember, I wanted to
talk to you about your
employment?

44:06.044 --> 44:08.346
Yes, for the purposes
of hiring me.

44:08.413 --> 44:12.617
Yeah, and also to identify
some plastic materials.

44:12.718 --> 44:14.552
Why'd you leave there?

44:14.619 --> 44:17.122
Partly downsizing.

44:17.188 --> 44:19.758
Military cuts,
fewer weapons development,

44:19.825 --> 44:22.593
and then I had some issues
with management.

44:22.728 --> 44:23.594
What kind of issues?

44:23.729 --> 44:25.363
Psychiatric, caused by them.

44:25.430 --> 44:28.166
I am not a crazy person.
That is a stressful place.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.235
- They induce things.
- Right.

44:30.301 --> 44:31.302
I hear ya.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.406
Why don't you just
show me this plastic.

44:35.473 --> 44:36.473
Yeah.

44:47.085 --> 44:50.055
I saw your kiddie pool
out front there.

44:50.121 --> 44:51.957
Do you got some children
around here?

44:52.023 --> 44:54.760
No. Mine from when
I was a kid.

44:54.793 --> 44:56.137
Now I just use it
to catch rain water.

44:56.161 --> 44:57.362
You know, there's a drought.

44:57.428 --> 44:58.764
Right.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.202
I know what this is.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.304
What is it?

45:06.371 --> 45:07.505
I can't tell you.

45:07.572 --> 45:08.807
Patty: Why not?

45:08.874 --> 45:11.442
This is part of
a classified project.

45:11.509 --> 45:12.978
You shouldn't have it.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.080
It is a crime
for you to have this.

45:15.146 --> 45:17.682
Well, we didn't
steal it or anything,
we found it in the ocean.

45:17.783 --> 45:20.027
Well, if that's the case,
somebody at Borns Tech
is in a lot of trouble.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.987
You see, that plastic's
part of a program

45:22.053 --> 45:24.198
to test something that
isn't supposed to be
near anyplace

45:24.222 --> 45:26.224
where there are people or
really any living thing.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.059
Okay?

45:28.126 --> 45:30.796
I know.
I worked on that project.

45:30.862 --> 45:31.797
What project?

45:31.863 --> 45:35.133
I can't tell you that.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.402
Right, you keep saying that.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.871
You know, Ned,
we can pay you as
an expert witness,

45:39.938 --> 45:44.142
and maybe help you defray
some of these upkeep costs
you were talking about.

45:44.209 --> 45:46.477
- How much?
- We'll talk about that
later.

45:46.544 --> 45:50.715
Why don't you just tell us
exactly what this stuff is.

45:50.816 --> 45:51.983
It's casing.

45:52.050 --> 45:53.852
For ignition housing.

45:53.919 --> 45:55.186
Ignition housing.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.555
Bombs.

45:57.622 --> 45:59.324
Very big bombs.

45:59.390 --> 46:02.393
Rocket fueled,
laser guided
badass bombs.

46:02.460 --> 46:06.832
That shit
should never have been
near any fishing boat.

46:06.898 --> 46:09.334
Can I get you to say that
in affidavit form?

46:09.400 --> 46:11.937
Absolutely not.
This is a very big company.

46:12.003 --> 46:13.304
They can hurt people.

46:13.371 --> 46:17.042
We have legal mechanisms
to conceal your identity.

46:17.108 --> 46:18.820
If you're worried about
your personal safety,

46:18.844 --> 46:19.844
don't worry about that.

46:19.845 --> 46:22.213
[groans]

46:22.280 --> 46:24.115
[stammering]

46:24.182 --> 46:25.984
Could you stop that, please?

46:27.485 --> 46:30.088
I'm... I'm sorry,
what did... what did I do?

46:30.155 --> 46:31.933
You know what you're doing.
I want you to stop.

46:31.957 --> 46:33.624
What did she do?

46:33.691 --> 46:35.326
She's putting thoughts
into my head.

46:35.393 --> 46:36.862
She's sending them
through her eyes.

46:36.928 --> 46:39.197
And I want you to stop.

46:40.966 --> 46:42.500
Stop it, Patty, okay?

46:45.036 --> 46:47.105
She won't do it again,
Ned, don't worry.

46:53.011 --> 46:55.746
So, what's the plan?

46:55.881 --> 46:57.682
Is there a plan?
What are we going to do?

46:57.748 --> 46:58.984
'Cause if the case goes on...

46:59.050 --> 47:02.753
Judge Keller is
sympathetic to us.

47:02.888 --> 47:06.391
He will close them down
for good.

47:06.457 --> 47:07.457
Trust me.

47:10.228 --> 47:13.631
Is it so difficult
to trust me, Leonard?

47:13.698 --> 47:15.433
[clicker clicking]

47:16.935 --> 47:18.769
[sighs]
Whether or not I trust you,

47:18.904 --> 47:20.905
letting Billy McBride
rattle cages

47:20.906 --> 47:23.374
is... is like giving
a lunatic a hammer,

47:23.441 --> 47:25.043
and letting him
run through Tiffany's.

47:25.110 --> 47:26.444
That man is dangerous.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.148
But I'm more so.

47:31.950 --> 47:33.118
[clicker clicking]

47:42.928 --> 47:44.595
You asleep?

47:44.662 --> 47:46.131
Not even close.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.301
Nervous?

47:53.939 --> 47:55.941
Yeah, yeah, I'm nervous.

48:05.583 --> 48:06.583
Hey.

48:08.686 --> 48:10.989
It's like riding a bike.

48:11.056 --> 48:13.624
You walk into that
judge's chamber,

48:13.691 --> 48:17.028
you become Billy McBride again.

48:17.095 --> 48:19.164
You wait and see.

48:28.539 --> 48:29.975
How about I relax you?

48:35.446 --> 48:36.446
No.

48:36.481 --> 48:38.116
You sure?

48:43.254 --> 48:45.790
One of these days.

48:45.856 --> 48:47.492
[chuckles]

48:54.465 --> 48:55.465
Come here.

49:04.509 --> 49:05.576
[sighs]

49:09.580 --> 49:11.516
[seagulls squawking]

49:14.185 --> 49:16.321
[traffic noise]

49:25.563 --> 49:28.433
Jeez.
Join the crowd, honey.

49:32.037 --> 49:33.138
Excuse me.

49:33.204 --> 49:35.673
I'm going to court, sweetie.

49:35.740 --> 49:37.508
It's no place you want to be.

49:37.575 --> 49:40.645
No place you want to be.
I'll see you later. Okay?

49:46.251 --> 49:47.618
What's wrong, Billy?

49:49.054 --> 49:50.588
You look nervous.

49:50.655 --> 49:52.423
Oh, I'm not nervous,
I'm just tired.

49:52.490 --> 49:55.360
I was up all night
preparing to whip your ass.

49:56.694 --> 49:57.995
[door opens]

49:59.530 --> 50:03.068
Okay, Mr. McBride.
This is your show.

50:03.134 --> 50:04.735
What have you got?

50:04.802 --> 50:06.771
No idle chitchat first?

50:06.837 --> 50:08.506
You have 20 minutes, sir.

50:08.573 --> 50:11.342
Okay. I'll try to do it
in about five.

50:17.748 --> 50:20.751
This is the affidavit
of Ryan Larsen's son,

50:20.818 --> 50:23.788
declaring his opinion
that this was no suicide.

50:23.854 --> 50:28.326
This is my personal affidavit
of conversations I had
with eyewitnesses

50:28.393 --> 50:31.028
who say that this explosion
was a helluva lot bigger,

50:31.096 --> 50:32.673
and a helluva lot worse
than what would happen

50:32.697 --> 50:35.533
if you dropped a match
into a fuel tank of a boat.

50:35.600 --> 50:39.237
Now, this one right here
contains all of the anecdotal

50:39.304 --> 50:41.439
physical and
testimonial evidence

50:41.506 --> 50:44.375
introduced or alleged
by anyone who supports

50:44.442 --> 50:46.777
the notion that
Ryan Larsen was suicidal.

50:46.844 --> 50:49.114
And as you can see, it's blank.

50:49.180 --> 50:50.781
Because there ain't nobody.

50:50.848 --> 50:54.085
This is the video footage
of the actual explosion.

50:54.152 --> 50:56.454
[explosions]

50:58.123 --> 51:00.625
Match in a fuel tank.

51:00.691 --> 51:03.694
This is the declaration
of one Alejandro Marquez

51:03.761 --> 51:06.764
authenticating that he
captured this video footage,

51:06.831 --> 51:10.135
and that it's a fair and
accurate representation
of what happened

51:10.168 --> 51:12.537
the night that
Ryan Larsen was killed.

51:12.603 --> 51:15.940
These are remnants of
the debris that rained down
on the Marquez boat

51:16.006 --> 51:17.408
immediately following
the explosion.

51:17.475 --> 51:19.944
They can be confirmed
in his declaration there.

51:20.010 --> 51:22.280
And this is the affidavit
of John Doe,

51:22.347 --> 51:24.315
an ex-employee
of Borns Tech.

51:24.382 --> 51:28.419
He has conducted
a preliminary analysis
of this debris here,

51:28.486 --> 51:31.522
and he's determined that
it's plastic shell casing
material,

51:31.589 --> 51:34.992
material that's used in
the weaponry of Borns Tech.

51:35.059 --> 51:38.363
More specifically,
ignition housing
used only on weapons

51:38.429 --> 51:40.898
that are inherently dangerous.

51:40.965 --> 51:43.468
And not allowed
outside a war zone.

51:43.534 --> 51:45.636
Or a weapons testing facility.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.905
I think if you
examine this evidence,

51:47.972 --> 51:49.674
you could safely make a finding.

51:52.243 --> 51:54.879
I rest my case.

51:56.714 --> 51:59.784
This would be a good time
for one of you to talk.

52:01.352 --> 52:04.989
Uh, first of all,
all any of this,
uh, shows

52:05.055 --> 52:06.591
is that a boat blew up.

52:06.657 --> 52:09.760
None of it unearths any new
evidence of wrongdoing

52:09.827 --> 52:11.862
or confirms it.

52:13.231 --> 52:14.665
Nothing new was unearthed.

52:14.732 --> 52:19.304
Is... Is that what you mean
to tell me, Miss Senate?

52:19.370 --> 52:22.039
This is smoke and mirrors,
your honor.

52:22.106 --> 52:23.674
I'd also ask you to
take judicial note

52:23.741 --> 52:25.776
of Mr. McBride's reputation
for truthfulness.

52:30.215 --> 52:31.449
Well.

52:34.018 --> 52:36.854
Well, well, well, folks.

52:38.289 --> 52:40.691
We have ourselves a lawsuit.

52:40.758 --> 52:43.761
♫♫

52:55.240 --> 52:56.641
[elevator dings]

53:01.812 --> 53:03.481
I got a question.

53:03.548 --> 53:05.516
What the fuck happened
on the boat?

53:05.583 --> 53:09.420
♫♫ [indistinct blues singing]

54:32.136 --> 54:33.804
You stinker!
