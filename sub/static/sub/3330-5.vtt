00:04.771 --> 00:06.505
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:10.776
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:12.644
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:15.180
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.616
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:20.019
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:21.487
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.489 --> 00:22.755
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:22.757 --> 00:24.690
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:26.558
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.727
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.729 --> 00:31.163
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.165 --> 00:33.365
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:35.634
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:38.437
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.439 --> 00:40.372
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:01.160
â™ª

01:28.388 --> 01:29.388
Now!

01:29.390 --> 01:30.823
On the ground!

01:30.825 --> 01:32.157
Do it right now!

01:34.461 --> 01:38.197
I want to talk
to walter o'brien!

01:43.269 --> 01:45.604
I said we could come in for
an hour before school started.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.439
That ended
five minutes ago, bud.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.343
Ralph, did you even
touch your breakfast?

01:51.345 --> 01:55.214
Hey, I gave you your own set
of allen wrenches for a reason.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.417
(chuckles)

01:58.419 --> 02:00.752
I have them set
by lens strength.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.720
Ah, well done.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.489
First optics test
is you check

02:03.491 --> 02:04.490
For spherical
aberration.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.491
Actually, the first test

02:05.493 --> 02:06.825
He needs to do is long division.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.229
Do you really think
we need a test to determine

02:10.231 --> 02:11.730
If he knows
long division?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.399
Point taken, but he still needs
to be at school on time.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.201
Go downstairs and get
your backpack. Come on.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.370
Can we run the test
together after school?

02:18.372 --> 02:19.738
Can't wait.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.843
I'll be back in 20...
What... What is that?

02:24.845 --> 02:26.512
It's a centrifuge.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.846
So, you guys have been
up here for hours,

02:27.848 --> 02:29.848
No breaks, and I'll assume
you skipped breakfast.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.816
We're working here.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.151
Ralph does the same thing.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.619
Well, focus is normal

02:33.621 --> 02:35.154
When someone...

02:35.156 --> 02:36.288
"goes down the
rabbit hole."

02:36.290 --> 02:37.456
You'll know.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.757
What's a rabbit hole?

02:38.759 --> 02:40.926
Dehydration,
loss of sense of time,

02:40.928 --> 02:42.694
Antisocial behavior.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.530
And how do you avoid that?

02:44.532 --> 02:46.765
You avoid it by starting
a team like scorpion.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.301
Come, here.

02:51.804 --> 02:55.541
Toby:
I'm seeing... Ace of spades.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.909
Wait a minute.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.877
You think you're sneaky, huh?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.879
I've never seen him happier.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.848
He's in the right place.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.616
This isn't
your card?!

03:04.618 --> 03:05.484
Is this your card?

03:05.486 --> 03:06.952
Car, now.

03:06.954 --> 03:07.953
Ralph.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.556
And don't listen
to any of your teachers.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.627
Pick one-- 20 bucks says I can
guess it in under five seconds.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.663
Is this your way
of asking for a loan?

03:18.798 --> 03:20.933
You blew your money, didn't you?

03:20.935 --> 03:23.635
Your ex-fiancÃ©e told you
to never call her again,

03:23.637 --> 03:25.537
And you licked your wounds
at a card table?

03:25.539 --> 03:26.605
Wrong.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.873
Cleaned up at a card table.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.641
I got killed at craps.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.743
Perhaps next time
I should just call you.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.811
Absolutely wrong.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.247
Not that I would, but if I did,

03:35.249 --> 03:37.649
What exactly would be
so wrong about that?

03:37.651 --> 03:40.886
We don't have the time.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.721
See, that's why I gamble.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.857
Walter! Why the hell aren't you
answering your phone?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.659
(groans)
I was working!

03:47.661 --> 03:49.228
I need you to come with me.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.462
Just you. Urgent.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.563
What is it?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.233
You know the name mark collins?

03:55.001 --> 03:56.702
Yeah.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.006
Let's keep this quiet.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.276
Cabe: Collins breached
the unmarked perimeter

04:04.278 --> 04:07.679
At the military-controlled
montero nuclear reactor,

04:07.681 --> 04:09.281
About five miles from here.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.716
Did he say
why he did it?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.851
All he's said so far
is your name.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.486
Wonder why that is.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.656
I haven't talked
to him in years.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.258
Cabe:
General ned walker.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.759
The reactor's
under his command.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.929
Anything you can do
to determine his intent

04:23.931 --> 04:25.897
And threat level
would be a huge help.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.866
I'd like to get this buttoned up
as soon as possible.

04:27.868 --> 04:28.934
How active is the reactor?

04:28.936 --> 04:32.371
It's been decommissioned
and scheduled to be dismantled.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.806
Basically,
all we do is security.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.308
Now, how do you know
mr. Collins?

04:37.644 --> 04:40.879
Mark used to work
at my company, scorpion.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.288
(whispering indistinctly)

04:57.030 --> 04:58.864
Collins:
Hi, walter.
Mark.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.432
Walter: So, what's
going on here?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.401
782.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.869
Cabe:
What's that supposed to mean?

05:03.871 --> 05:06.038
You have the second sharpest
brain in the room, use it.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.306
782.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.373
What, is that
some kind of code?

05:08.375 --> 05:09.875
Walter: No, it's not
code, it's days.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.510
782 days
since we saw each other.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.078
Mark, these people
aren't messing about.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.547
Please, tell me-- why did you
trespass at the reactor?

05:15.549 --> 05:17.549
And why did you ask for me?

05:17.551 --> 05:18.984
You're working
with the feds now.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.819
I also heard about
that close call you had

05:20.821 --> 05:22.721
With the governor
on that biohacking thing.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.722
That wasn't reported.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.956
How'd you hear about that?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.559
No, he means,
literally he heard it.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.795
Mark's a radio... Expert.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.664
It's okay, you can say "hacker."

05:32.666 --> 05:35.734
He monitors nearly every signal
that passes through the air.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.869
From truckers on cbs,
to cell phone calls,

05:37.871 --> 05:40.572
To military communications.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.075
How long have you been
spying on us?

05:43.077 --> 05:45.377
Yes, please, mr. Government,

05:45.379 --> 05:48.347
Go ahead and tell me again
how bad spying is.

05:49.749 --> 05:50.782
(whispering):
Mark.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.618
How's your head?

05:54.921 --> 05:56.688
Are we on solid ground now?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.490
I could ask you
the same thing, walter.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.660
But, yes,
I'm as clear as a bell.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.663
And I'm 100% sure
that there's a problem.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.765
I mean, come on, I wouldn't
expect these normals

06:06.767 --> 06:08.633
To understand--

06:08.635 --> 06:12.704
851.67, 851.69.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.742
With a moderate isolation scheme
I achieved a ten to the second,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.677
Ten to the fifth uptick in ber.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.913
Cabe:
What is he babbling about?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.749
632, black.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.118
646, green.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.886
March 25.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.421
You with me, walter?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.824
I knew I could
count on you.

06:32.826 --> 06:37.129
Need you to get to my house,
and open the notebooks.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.764
Inside, you'll find
everything you need

06:38.766 --> 06:39.865
To make sense of it all.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.866
Make sense of what?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.868
Something big is happening.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.703
That's not gonna suffice, son.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.971
Come on, what is it they say

06:45.973 --> 06:47.806
About time and being
of the essence?!

06:47.808 --> 06:48.874
Take him back
to the cell.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.776
Walter.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.911
It's something big,
walter.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.886
Guy says something big's coming,
then clams up.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.854
Why is it you geniuses
are such a pain in the ass?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.022
He's not to me.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.124
He knows I understand
his expertise,

07:06.126 --> 07:09.961
But I won't know for sure
exactly what he's going on about

07:09.963 --> 07:11.730
Until I see his notes.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.964
So, I'm gonna have
to call my team,

07:12.966 --> 07:14.800
Get them to meet us
at mark's house.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.769
Gentlemen, we have zero interest
in opening the circle on this.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.071
I will ensure
their discretion, sir.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.744
What was that about earlier,

07:25.746 --> 07:27.813
About you keeping your head
on solid ground?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.548
Mark's always had
the wrong idea about me,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.550
It's best to leave it at that.

07:31.552 --> 07:35.987
Also, best not to tell the team
whose house we're going to.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.804
You know how much we love
a good mystery, walter.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.606
What exactly are
we doing here?

07:54.608 --> 07:55.640
Working.

08:01.514 --> 08:05.150
Paige:
Whoa, I bet this picks up the
country station nice and clear.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.586
That is quite a fence.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.854
Half-inch diameter rebar,

08:08.856 --> 08:11.223
Reinforced steel
chain-link mesh.

08:11.225 --> 08:12.791
Pure paranoia.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.759
Toby: When I rotated
through bellevue psychiatric,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.828
I treated a patient who wore
a diaper on his head

08:16.830 --> 08:18.063
And called himself
"king poo poo."

08:18.065 --> 08:19.831
This is crazier.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.068
There can't be more than
a few people in california

08:23.070 --> 08:24.703
With this much
listening equipment.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.804
Whose house is this, walter?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.872
Keep an open mind.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.039
Mark collins?!

08:28.041 --> 08:29.741
Are you insane?

08:29.743 --> 08:30.742
No, but collins is.

08:30.744 --> 08:34.079
He was a member of the team,
it didn't work out.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.082
With collins, "didn't work out"
is an understatement.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.183
You lured us here.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.651
Would you have come if you knew?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.619
No.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.555
We're looking for.
All we need is data.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.556
Where's collins?

08:44.558 --> 08:46.091
He was arrested.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.726
Of course he is.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.895
All right, let's get
a move on, come on.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.631
Paige:
My god, was he always like this?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.666
Walter: Looks like he had
a lonely few years.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.568
Oh, tough for him.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.870
What's the story
with this collins?

08:58.872 --> 09:01.840
Well, if you didn't
agree with him,

09:01.842 --> 09:04.643
He'd argue with
you until you did,

09:04.645 --> 09:06.044
And he knew
his mind games.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.647
The worst of it was
how he affected walter.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.983
Erase his good judgment
and forget we existed.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.818
Guys.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.253
We're supposed
to be working here.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.822
They really don't like this guy.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.891
Maybe you should have
told them up front?

09:21.193 --> 09:25.263
Just saying,
secrets breed mistrust.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.165
2004, 2005 through 2014.

09:27.167 --> 09:31.269
Playing all the hits
from the obsessive top 40.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.904
Got the tape from March 25.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.873
Cue up 6:32 a.M.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.010
It's incredible work.

09:39.012 --> 09:42.614
So, this guy was like you guys,
and then... This?

09:42.616 --> 09:43.782
It happens sometimes.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.183
With mark,
it was intense, though.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.885
Like, if you played chess
with him,

09:46.887 --> 09:48.253
He'd make you doubt
your every move.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.589
And then "blammo"-- checkmate.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.223
Against you?

09:52.225 --> 09:54.326
Cabe:
Walter.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.860
Walter.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.863
Walter.

09:58.865 --> 09:59.864
Walter!

09:59.866 --> 10:00.865
What?

10:00.867 --> 10:03.868
I said your name
four times.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.136
I'm good.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.005
Play the tape.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.874
6:32 a.M.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.109
Man:
But, sir, I'm almost certain

10:11.111 --> 10:12.844
There will be a major problem

10:12.846 --> 10:15.013
Unless we find a way
to run the scada update.

10:17.984 --> 10:21.653
Nothing until 6:46.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.154
Channel went dark
for 14 minutes.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.156
Who is that on tape?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.892
A scientist at the reactor,
talking over an internal radio.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.294
And "scada"?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.896
These old reactors run on
ancient 1980s technology.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.733
Scada is the brain that controls
the rest of the system.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.635
And it needs to be kept
up to date.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.836
What are they covering up?

10:38.904 --> 10:41.072
Collins has been down here
for years

10:41.074 --> 10:43.274
Capturing everything he could
about his neighbor,

10:43.276 --> 10:45.377
The montero nuclear power plant.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.646
Rising ocean temperatures,

10:47.648 --> 10:50.115
Radiation levels near the plant.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.883
Right, so the water's
getting warmer,

10:51.885 --> 10:53.818
More radioactive,
and then someone

10:53.820 --> 10:55.253
At the power plant
says there's a problem.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.921
Poof, communications went blank.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.957
Collins is alerting us
to a major problem

10:58.959 --> 11:00.759
At the reactor
that's being actively ignored.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.993
Why on earth would
someone do that?

11:01.995 --> 11:05.997
Shocking to think that would
extend to nuclear materials,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.432
But it does.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.833
Okay, so we pass this on

11:08.835 --> 11:10.869
To the army,
and we are done here, right?

11:10.871 --> 11:12.003
Walter:
No.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.739
Unless he thought it needed
our expertise.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.341
Since when does he call us?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.243
General walker said
he needs our help.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.278
Who knows how dangerous
this situation is?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.781
Exactly.
Guys, what's happening here?

11:24.917 --> 11:27.886
We just took a job upgrading
an ancient nuclear power plant.

11:27.888 --> 11:31.022
End of story.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.125
Want to know what's
really happening here?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.760
Mark collins is
back in our lives.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.063
If this nuclear power plant
doesn't melt down,

11:38.065 --> 11:39.230
The team might.

12:02.755 --> 12:03.822
Oh, oh, this is wonderful.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.223
The creepiest place
on earth.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.491
We'll upgrade the system.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.892
We'll be gone in two hours.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.462
Without speaking
to collins, correct?

12:10.464 --> 12:11.896
General's coming.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.031
General.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.299
All right.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.467
Somebody educate me.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.736
You guys wait here.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.475
Now, collins
intercepted discussions

12:23.477 --> 12:25.343
About the reactor's
software and computers.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.811
Now, the ones that regulate

12:26.813 --> 12:28.246
The nuclear
core temperatures

12:28.248 --> 12:30.348
Were installed
in the late 1980s.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.983
Walter believes
that the software

12:31.985 --> 12:34.419
Should've been completely
updated 15 years ago.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.420
Walter:
Standard bureaucratic mentality

12:35.422 --> 12:36.788
Is to go cheap,

12:36.790 --> 12:38.056
Patches on patches.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.024
This whole system becomes
a house of cards.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.060
But I'm looking at
a core temperature gauge

12:42.062 --> 12:45.830
There are shoddy indicators
all around this place.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.332
Mind if I try something?

12:47.334 --> 12:48.833
Thank you.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.001
The plant's got
time-worn fail-safes,

12:50.003 --> 12:51.202
But we're supposed to believe

12:51.204 --> 12:52.904
Some rambling lunatic

12:52.906 --> 12:57.342
Well, a brilliant mind
with a likely 190 iq.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.545
(whirring)

13:04.183 --> 13:06.785
General, you had a loose fuse.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.052
Oh, no.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.187
Why don't you play the tape?

13:09.189 --> 13:11.256
General, let me
show you something.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.428
Man: The problem is,
it stopped regulating

13:17.430 --> 13:19.864
And a scada update
is risky as hell.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.065
God help us if it fails.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.233
That's dr. Fitzsimmons,

13:22.235 --> 13:26.404
Yeah, on a cell call to his wife
saying that the reactor software

13:26.406 --> 13:28.306
Is failing to regulate
the nuclear core temperatures,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.008
And he's too scared
to say anything.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.177
Now, he's the one that runs
your safety checks, correct?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.412
And he just moved
to pennsylvania six weeks ago.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.014
His replacement
hasn't been hired.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.315
The only regular traffic here

13:37.317 --> 13:39.384
Are the mps guarding
the perimeter.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.186
The reactor's inoperative.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.188
It's in cool-down mode
for the next eight years

13:43.190 --> 13:46.591
Walter: Except it's not
being properly regulated.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.227
So it's not cooling down,
it's overheating.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.030
Now, the system needs
scada updates.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.599
Supervisory control
and data acquisition.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.868
You know, I confess
to a basic knowledge

13:56.870 --> 13:57.936
Of the technology here,

13:57.938 --> 13:59.437
So if we're facing
the next fukishima,

13:59.439 --> 14:01.105
Tell me that.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.141
General, I can fix this,

14:03.143 --> 14:06.010
And as soon as collins
gets here, we begin.
Collins?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.446
So the guy in the tin foil hat
is gonna walk us out of this?

14:08.448 --> 14:09.480
Look.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.183
From listening to chatter,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.551
Collins diagramed this exactly.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.454
Patches on patches.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.122
Now, if we try to upgrade

14:18.124 --> 14:19.991
Using the wrong
building blocks,

14:19.993 --> 14:21.092
It could fry the whole system.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.160
Collins' knowledge

14:22.162 --> 14:23.494
Of this mess

14:23.496 --> 14:24.863
Could help prevent that,

14:24.865 --> 14:28.967
I'd say we have 18 hours
before it starts to overheat.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.602
Don't even say
the word "meltdown."

14:30.604 --> 14:34.138
Keep him in handcuffs with a gun
at his back for all I care.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.340
We need him.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.343
Toby:
A little more on collins?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.911
He's what my teachers used
to call me,

14:39.913 --> 14:43.181
Would push each other
and just get lost in the work.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.149
Theoretical algorithms
for days.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.252
No breaks, no food, no sleep.
They'd barely speak.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.087
Sometimes we'd lose
walter for weeks.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.055
It's called
a savant dissociative state.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.991
Not pretty.
Then what?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.292
Mark just disappeared.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.560
Thin air.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.961
Walter was pretty affected.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.030
Simply put,
mark is disruptive.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.131
So, project manager,

15:00.133 --> 15:02.066
Does today strike you
as a good day

15:02.068 --> 15:03.635
For disruptive?

15:08.073 --> 15:10.074
Cabe:
You going to talk to our man?

15:10.076 --> 15:14.312
Good. I may not know
that much about geniuses,

15:14.314 --> 15:16.614
But I do know when
someone's keeping a secret.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.683
Okay.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.655
You're making a lot
of unilateral decisions

15:23.657 --> 15:25.390
To include a guy
no one else wants.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.925
They'll have to deal with it.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.094
And four million people
from getting cooked.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.396
You obviously have
a very different relationship

15:31.398 --> 15:32.931
With collins than the others,

15:32.933 --> 15:34.966
And you miss it
since he left?

15:34.968 --> 15:36.668
Yes, exactly.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.503
Or is it that he's now alone
living in squalor,

15:38.505 --> 15:39.671
And you feel bad for him?

15:39.673 --> 15:41.005
You know I don't think
emotionally.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.242
Which you're certainly
not making it easy to do.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.110
A little insight

15:46.112 --> 15:48.079
Would help everyone.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.416
(whooping)

15:51.418 --> 15:54.218
(grunting)
wise choice,

15:54.220 --> 15:55.653
My friend.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.055
Come on, let's get to work.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.023
(sighs)
the gang's all here.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.124
I love it!

16:00.126 --> 16:02.327
Sylvester, my brother!
Come on.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.529
Well, come on!

16:05.698 --> 16:08.232
Now, this is
a two-pronged attack.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.600
There's two computers
that need our attention.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.169
First there's this one.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.370
It runs the reactor.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.439
Exactly whom are we
taking orders from?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.240
Both of us.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.743
We need to download the reactor
calibrations from here.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.445
For the civilians?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.146
Reactor calibrations
tell the computer

16:22.148 --> 16:25.350
So it knows what's an alarm
and what's normal.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.318
Can't update the system
without getting that information

16:27.320 --> 16:28.553
Here first.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.355
Did you get smarter, sylvester?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.290
I think I've always been
this smart.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.291
Right.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.659
Second thing we need to do

16:34.661 --> 16:36.761
Is to prep the system
for the scada update.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.163
Otherwise, it would be
like putting a new v12

16:39.165 --> 16:41.265
In an old model t.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.400
Happy,

16:42.402 --> 16:43.701
You and toby can handle that.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.004
I do not like him
handing out assignments.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.405
It's efficient, happy.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.241
We're here to do a job.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.676
Now, the main computer,
that's near here?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.011
We're at the reactor.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.746
The mainframe is

16:54.748 --> 16:58.783
About a quarter mile
across the campus, max.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.151
All right.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.319
Come on.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.121
Get a move on, people.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.656
We have a job to do.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.063
Remember what I said.

17:16.502 --> 17:17.802
Oh, my god.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.038
This technology
predates my birth.

17:22.274 --> 17:24.675
Well, hello. We come to you

17:24.677 --> 17:25.743
From the distant past.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.378
(computers whirring)

17:28.647 --> 17:29.680
Are we seriously

17:29.682 --> 17:31.749
Supposed to stop
a nuclear meltdown

17:31.751 --> 17:32.784
With this junk?

17:32.786 --> 17:34.652
You are and you will.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.755
He really tests my nerves.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.824
Prepare the scada
system upgrade.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.726
We'll be there in ten minutes.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.464
Hey.
Mm-hmm?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.199
Thanks for letting me
help with this.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.435
It was efficient.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.271
Some things never change.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.107
Except now you're getting paid.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.709
Team's coming together.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.079
You got a girl.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.114
You've been spending
too much time in your basement.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.116
You could've called

18:05.118 --> 18:07.785
The cops or the military,
but you-you chose us.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.620
Why?

18:09.622 --> 18:12.523
Do you ever think
about any of our old projects?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.559
We were making a lot of progress

18:14.561 --> 18:16.761
On our super symmetry theory.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.864
Maybe when we wrap up here,
you could show me the new data?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.868
Maybe you owe me one?

18:23.870 --> 18:28.840
I wasn't pleased with the way
that things turned out.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.442
Was that "eq" walter?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.177
Maybe you could reminisce later?

18:33.179 --> 18:34.879
Focus on the work right now.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.781
Boss man's right.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.184
Okay, uh, for this
section of code,

18:40.186 --> 18:41.486
You're gonna need
rpl and paradox.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.187
Walter:
This os isn't corrupt?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.156
It's like they have
their own language.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.592
Imagine that kind of intensity
for three weeks straight.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.127
And he just disappeared,
no trace?

18:49.129 --> 18:51.496
Walter wouldn't discuss it.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.164
Collins:
Okay.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.133
We're good to download
the reactor calibrations.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.135
Sylvester, you're on.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.169
Wait.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.171
We have not run
a full diagnostic.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.405
If we don't stress-test

19:01.407 --> 19:02.807
The system circuitry,

19:02.809 --> 19:04.842
It could be us melting
this place down.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.412
When we upgrade, it will pump
a lot of electricity

19:08.414 --> 19:09.714
Through this junk pile.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.182
If this system has flaws--

19:11.184 --> 19:13.384
Old wiring,
rat-chewed insulation--

19:13.386 --> 19:16.154
We want to know now and where
so we can fortify.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.189
No, that's a waste of time.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.891
We're not rebuilding
a motorcycle engine.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.227
Look, that test alone
could overload the system.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.929
Walter, I know
what I'm talking about.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.531
Not more than I do.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.599
Would someone make
the call here?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.904
Happy, we've only
got one shot.

19:32.906 --> 19:35.606
If your diagnostic
crashes the system,

19:35.608 --> 19:37.842
Then we have a meltdown
in 17 hours,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.777
And we might not have
enough time

19:39.779 --> 19:41.379
To rebuild the system
from scratch.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.680
If collins runs the download

19:42.682 --> 19:44.182
Before the system's
ready for it,

19:44.184 --> 19:45.516
We have a meltdown now.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.918
Happy's never liked me.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.786
Her opposition is personal.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.555
It's not based on knowledge.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.891
Knowledge that I have of
this reactor that she doesn't.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.893
Trust me.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.762
I have complete confidence
in this.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.597
Well, you'd better be
right, son.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.866
Because there's no do-over.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.401
Don't do it, walter.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.383
Sylvester:
Okay.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.753
We are downloading
the reactor calibrations.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.989
Four-minute eta.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.824
Walt, a minute outside.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.459
Yeah.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.394
You might have just bought
yourself some good will

20:30.396 --> 20:31.996
For that trespassing charge.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.365
I'm just glad
to be of service, general.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.609
Don't ever take

20:44.611 --> 20:46.911
Someone else's side over me
in public again, walter,

20:46.913 --> 20:49.947
Or I will disappear on you
faster than collins did.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.015
You're taking this personal.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.383
It was business.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.951
I was trying to avoid
a meltdown.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.421
I already stopped
a meltdown-- yours.

20:57.423 --> 21:01.959
Ten-day bender with collins,
and who pulled you out of it?

21:01.961 --> 21:04.562
You were damn near starved,
muttering to yourself.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.031
I practically had
to force-feed you.

21:07.033 --> 21:10.701
When he bailed,
it was the best thing for us.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.571
And him being back is the worst.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.673
And if he stays,

21:15.675 --> 21:17.842
And you take another trip
down the rabbit hole with him,

21:17.844 --> 21:20.544
You are on your own.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.380
I am not going
through that again.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.682
Happy...

21:24.684 --> 21:25.716
Happy!

21:33.725 --> 21:34.725
What is this?

21:34.727 --> 21:38.763
The note expresses a few things
that might make you smile.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.564
Are you kidding?
I'm going toe-to-toe with walter

21:40.566 --> 21:41.999
And you hand me a mash note?

21:42.001 --> 21:44.335
When you feel the time is right,
read it,

21:44.337 --> 21:46.337
And you will understand
why I gave it to you.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.005
Pretend I know a little
about the human psyche.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.374
"rebuilding
a motorcycle engine."

21:50.376 --> 21:51.876
Collins always loved
digging that knife in.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.745
You love rebuilding
motorcycle engines.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.681
It's hardly the breadth
of my ability.

21:59.351 --> 22:02.019
Screw him. This computer
could still use a circuit test.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.355
We can at least do
half this job safely.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.824
(typing)

22:07.826 --> 22:09.493
Sylvester?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.495
Almost done downloading
the old reactor configuration.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.030
Okay.

22:13.032 --> 22:16.667
The others were always
very sharp, walter,

22:16.669 --> 22:19.837
But they were never us.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.376
(explosion)

22:25.378 --> 22:27.812
(alarm blaring)

22:27.814 --> 22:29.513
Oh, no.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.017
Happy, what do you see?

22:33.019 --> 22:35.519
The backup generator
in chamber one blew out.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.622
Walter, I think it's my fault.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.825
It happened right after
I-I ran the system check.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.493
Happy, I told you not to!

22:42.495 --> 22:45.096
Before all
the containment doors close.

22:45.098 --> 22:47.832
Why am I thinking
this isn't a drill?

22:47.834 --> 22:48.966
No, this is what you get

22:48.968 --> 22:50.668
When an aging system
is held together

22:50.670 --> 22:52.837
With duct tape and a hail mary
for 30 years.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.106
(beeping, hissing)

22:55.108 --> 22:56.807
Cooling system! Radiation leak!

22:57.943 --> 22:59.443
Get out of here now!

22:59.445 --> 23:01.746
(alarm continues blaring)

23:01.748 --> 23:03.948
O'brien, get
your ass in gear!

23:03.950 --> 23:04.949
No, we're still downloading.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.117
If I leave now, we're all dead.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.785
I can still fix this.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.521
Give me an eta.

23:11.690 --> 23:12.623
(beeps)

23:12.625 --> 23:16.660
We can upgrade the system
in the computer room.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.062
If we get out alive.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.930
(alarm continues blaring)

23:23.001 --> 23:24.802
The containment doors
are closing!

23:24.804 --> 23:27.004
Should we tell them that if
the core temp keeps rising

23:27.006 --> 23:29.740
At this rate, we're less than
60 minutes from full meltdown?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.510
Maybe hold that off
until they're out.

23:36.681 --> 23:37.481
Hurry!

23:37.483 --> 23:38.816
Come on, cabe, come on!

23:39.851 --> 23:40.851
Go, go, go!

23:40.853 --> 23:41.919
Get to the door,
get to the door!

23:41.921 --> 23:43.154
Paige:
Walter!

23:43.156 --> 23:44.989
Paige, get to the door!
Walter!

23:44.991 --> 23:48.459
(shouts)

23:48.461 --> 23:51.195
There's got to be a way
to get them out of here.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.030
(grunts)
guys, there's a door

23:53.032 --> 23:55.900
At the end of the walkway
over the cooling room.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.836
It must be defective 'cause it's
closing slower than the others.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.438
But you'd better move
your asses.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.874
(alarm continues blaring)

24:12.184 --> 24:13.951
Over there, the door!

24:15.787 --> 24:16.921
(grunts)

24:16.923 --> 24:17.822
Cabe!

24:18.557 --> 24:19.490
Cabe!

24:19.492 --> 24:20.791
Hurry.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.893
Cabe! Cabe! It's not gonna hold!

24:22.895 --> 24:23.894
Go now!

24:23.896 --> 24:25.529
Cabe, it's not gonna...

24:29.568 --> 24:31.669
There's got to be an override
here somewhere.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.939
Ah, damn it!

24:34.941 --> 24:37.808
How much time
to get me out of here?

24:37.810 --> 24:40.244
You hold on tight.
I'm gonna figure this out.

24:50.555 --> 24:51.922
What's going on?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.591
Walter's safe.
Cabe's trapped in there.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.092
(alarm blaring in distance)

24:55.094 --> 24:56.093
Thanks to you.

24:56.095 --> 24:57.728
Hey, how about
you settle down?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.196
Oh, that's cute.

24:59.198 --> 25:03.267
The tell-it-like-it-is shrink
making up for his pal's mistake.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.970
All right, I got it-- layout
of the entire power plant.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.571
There's got to be
an escape route

25:07.573 --> 25:08.672
For cabe in here somewhere.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.575
No. No!

25:11.577 --> 25:14.111
The monitor won't let me
see the full size.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.846
Print it.
Okay, good idea.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.216
(printer whirring)

25:20.185 --> 25:23.120
Are you kidding me?

25:23.122 --> 25:25.189
Come on, you slow bastard!

25:25.191 --> 25:27.024
(printer buzzes)

25:27.026 --> 25:29.226
Okay, I'm sorry I yelled.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.996
Guys, where are we?

25:31.998 --> 25:34.064
The reactor blueprints won't
print, the monitor's frozen.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.833
This is bad.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.902
(explosion in distance)

25:40.005 --> 25:41.805
Happy:
It just got worse.

25:41.807 --> 25:43.741
That's radioactive steam
escaping.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.209
Walter?

25:45.211 --> 25:46.911
Cabe?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.879
A pipe just broke.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.582
I need to know
if that steam's contaminated.

25:51.584 --> 25:52.850
The structural integrity

25:52.852 --> 25:54.718
Of the building you're
in may be compromised.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.721
It's a large room;
if you're out in ten minutes,

25:57.723 --> 25:59.290
It won't be worse than
a couple of x rays.

25:59.292 --> 26:02.126
What's the likelihood I'm gonna
get out of here in ten minutes?

26:02.128 --> 26:03.260
(microphone beeps)

26:03.262 --> 26:05.262
He knows the greater good
would be to

26:05.264 --> 26:07.765
Forget about him and concentrate
on stopping the meltdown.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.966
We can't let him die.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.568
You're actually worried
about a man's life?

26:10.570 --> 26:12.770
That's not the walter o'brien
I remember.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.738
You can help him.
Doesn't need all of us

26:14.740 --> 26:15.940
To upgrade the system.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.908
We could solve
two problems at once.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.211
The effluent pipe.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.080
Pumps water out of the reactor
and into the ocean.

26:23.082 --> 26:27.685
He could get in it and ride it
out away from the power plant.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.588
I don't remember
off the top of my head.

26:30.590 --> 26:34.058
I recorded radio chatter about
it last cooling system check.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.060
June of '04.
It's back at my house.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.094
It's five minutes away.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.063
Take him.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.998
Under guard.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.067
Happy, go with him,

26:43.069 --> 26:44.134
Translate the schematics.

26:46.237 --> 26:47.938
Toby:
Hey, collins,

26:47.940 --> 26:50.341
You lay off her,
or we have an issue.

26:52.377 --> 26:55.079
Happy and collins might not
play nice together. Can you...

26:55.081 --> 26:56.180
I'll go with them.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.348
Walter, do I want to hear

26:57.350 --> 26:59.850
The stats on
how this might turn out?

26:59.852 --> 27:00.851
Cabe.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.720
Walter?

27:02.722 --> 27:06.757
I'd say, best guess,
you have a one-in-three chance.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.694
Walter, if my life
is in the hands

27:10.696 --> 27:12.329
Of this collins guy,

27:12.331 --> 27:15.766
I need to know
if you're hiding something.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.905
Three years ago, I had him
committed to an asylum.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.675
Fantastic.

27:27.912 --> 27:30.714
(panting)

27:30.716 --> 27:33.317
June 2004.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.826
(tape rewinding)

27:44.062 --> 27:46.764
Three minutes until cabe gets
radiation poisoning.

27:48.734 --> 27:55.039
Man: Effluent channel, outbound
to ocean, pipe 6, chamber 19-a.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.774
Paige:
Walter,

27:56.776 --> 27:58.409
Pipe 6, chamber 19-a.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.710
How certain are we?

27:59.712 --> 28:01.011
Totally certain.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.846
Unless they changed it
in the last ten years,

28:02.848 --> 28:04.715
Which is possible.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.216
Cabe, we found the one pipe

28:06.218 --> 28:07.951
That's gonna get you
out to safety.

28:07.953 --> 28:09.420
Cabe:
What'll the other pipes do?

28:09.422 --> 28:11.221
Don't think about that
right now.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.824
Okay. But for the record, if
you're wrong and I get killed,

28:13.826 --> 28:15.859
I'm gonna be very pissed off.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.762
Yeah, I'll be pissed off
if you don't start running now.

28:18.764 --> 28:22.266
Cabe, chamber 19-a is
down the hall ahead of you.

28:25.336 --> 28:27.171
And the pipes have
access hatches.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.407
You drop in it, it should
carry you out to safety

28:30.409 --> 28:33.744
About a hundred yards
from shore.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.279
Okay, I'm ready.

28:36.848 --> 28:41.051
Hey, listen, kid,
if this doesn't work out...

28:41.053 --> 28:43.053
I'm glad I got to know you.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.089
Okay.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.493
A man gives you what could be
his last good-bye,

28:49.495 --> 28:51.261
And you say "okay"?

28:51.263 --> 28:53.197
You could use some
time on the couch.

28:56.935 --> 28:59.002
I may be seeing you soon,
sweetheart.

29:06.811 --> 29:07.811
He's in.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.784
Gonna say a little prayer
for him right now.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.385
I don't really believe in death.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.888
First rule of physics: Energy
can't be created or destroyed;

29:17.890 --> 29:19.123
It just changes shape.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.360
But still.

29:36.975 --> 29:37.808
Ladies.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.176
Mister, are you okay?

29:39.178 --> 29:40.844
Never better.

29:52.858 --> 29:55.259
Less than 30 minutes
to stop the meltdown.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.794
Now, step one was
the reactor calibrations,

29:56.796 --> 29:58.162
Which we downloaded.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.464
This is step two--
we're programming scada update.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.866
When we're finished, we can
send it to the reactor remotely.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.902
The moment this update
hits the reactor,

30:04.904 --> 30:07.204
It's programmed to drop
all of the core temperatures

30:07.206 --> 30:08.172
To a normal level.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.406
Which means
the meltdown is

30:09.408 --> 30:11.441
100% no longer a
threat, correct?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.143
Correct.
And then I get hammered.

30:14.445 --> 30:16.346
What if this doesn't work?

30:16.348 --> 30:18.182
You got roughly 45 minutes.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.483
Take your car, get ralph,

30:19.485 --> 30:22.052
Drive like hell
past the santa monica mountains.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.121
Radiation cloud should pool up

30:24.123 --> 30:25.389
In the san fernando valley
basin.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.224
You might be okay.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.893
No one would blame you
if you wanted a head start.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.528
If it doesn't work,
I'll go get ralph.

30:33.231 --> 30:34.832
But it will.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.166
I believe in us.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.970
Yeah, well, us is all I've got.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.252
(phone ringing)

30:55.254 --> 30:56.954
Tell me it's done.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.256
The reactor's safe?

30:59.258 --> 31:01.225
Yeah, I can talk you
through the reboot. Hold on.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.930
Collins:
Numbers are my photo albums.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.166
Days elapsed since
significant occurrences.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.868
I change them every morning.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.937
That's my birthday.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.272
My mother's birthday.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.140
So, I'm still
trying to piece out

31:17.142 --> 31:18.208
Your role here.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.145
No offense, but you're
clearly not a genius.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.180
No.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.415
But my son is enabled, like you.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.483
Oh.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.352
Walter's trying
to repair his youth

31:28.354 --> 31:29.353
Through your son.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.388
No, he cares about ralph,

31:31.390 --> 31:33.056
And ralph is crazy about walter.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.125
Of course
he is.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.127
Walter's the pied piper
of geniuses.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.929
We all worship him.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.430
What he's capable of,
how he makes us

31:40.432 --> 31:43.567
Feel special
for being special.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.602
That's why it hurts so much

31:45.604 --> 31:47.537
When he throws you away
when he's done with you.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.206
Walter would never do
something like that.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.608
I was his experiment, once.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.176
The highest iq

31:53.178 --> 31:55.245
That he'd ever seen,
other than his own.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.182
Until I couldn't color
in the lines

31:59.184 --> 32:00.684
The way that he wanted me to,

32:00.686 --> 32:01.685
And then I was gone.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.254
How many times

32:04.256 --> 32:06.690
Has he avoided conflict

32:06.692 --> 32:09.192
By telling you he's fine?

32:09.194 --> 32:11.595
You get about
1,000 "I'm fines"

32:11.597 --> 32:14.464
Before you realize
that nothing is fine

32:14.466 --> 32:16.300
And you are getting
shown the door.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.435
And then you realize

32:18.437 --> 32:20.437
That you're an experiment, too.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.073
You...

32:23.075 --> 32:25.142
And your son.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.477
Update's complete.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.979
Now we just need
to compress the file,

32:28.981 --> 32:30.213
Send it from here
to the reactor computer

32:30.215 --> 32:31.415
And no more nuclear meltdown.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.716
Sylvester, can you start
the compression?

32:32.718 --> 32:34.051
I can do that, yeah.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.355
This is like <i>war games.</i>

32:38.357 --> 32:39.589
When matthew broderick
avoided nuclear calamity

32:39.591 --> 32:40.691
With minutes to spare?

32:40.693 --> 32:43.360
That film had
a grouchy general, too.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.664
Not a movie guy, huh?

32:47.666 --> 32:50.300
Good work.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.003
Usually saving millions of lives
gets a bigger response.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.705
Just thinking.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.606
Yeah, well, you're
always thinking.

32:57.977 --> 33:02.579
I'll make sure the authorities
know that he was cooperative.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.680
No...

33:03.682 --> 33:04.982
That's not it.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.551
When I had him committed,

33:07.553 --> 33:09.653
I did it because he needed help,

33:09.655 --> 33:11.555
And for the team.

33:11.557 --> 33:14.358
But there's a part
of me that knows...

33:14.360 --> 33:16.426
That I did it for myself.
How's that?

33:16.428 --> 33:18.362
When he and I would
get into that state,

33:18.364 --> 33:20.764
Where nothing exists
but thought...

33:20.766 --> 33:22.332
It can be a wonderful place,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.601
But it can be terrifying.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.070
Because you don't know
if you can come out of it.

33:27.072 --> 33:29.706
Part of me knows that
I had collins committed

33:29.708 --> 33:33.243
To see if other people could
pull him from that place...

33:33.245 --> 33:35.245
In case I ever got to the point

33:35.247 --> 33:37.681
Where I couldn't
be pulled out on my own.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.383
Bull.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.318
You did the
right thing.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.753
This collins fella?

33:42.755 --> 33:44.287
He's got you
questioning yourself,

33:44.289 --> 33:45.455
Making you think you
did the wrong thing,

33:45.457 --> 33:46.690
But you didn't.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.759
He does have
a long history of that.

33:52.630 --> 33:53.697
Oh, no.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.539
This override was just switched
to manual 20 minutes ago.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.207
He knew happy would
run the diagnostics,

34:04.209 --> 34:06.276
He made her think
that she did something wrong

34:06.278 --> 34:07.310
When she didn't...

34:07.312 --> 34:09.279
Just like he does in chess.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.347
Makes you doubt your every move.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.082
He wanted to show up the team.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.383
Yeah, to prove his worth.

34:15.086 --> 34:16.286
Mark... No.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.487
What the hell's he done now?

34:17.489 --> 34:19.556
There's a piece of gear
called an rf dac.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.225
It converts digital signals
into analog

34:22.227 --> 34:24.294
And we need it to send
the update from this computer

34:24.296 --> 34:25.328
To the control room.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.663
Collins set this all up.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.165
Walter:
It's how collins
structured it.

34:28.167 --> 34:32.135
He knew would be triggered
once happy ran the system test.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.204
General, I'm sorry to say
there's a third step.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.672
We need analog antennas.

34:35.674 --> 34:36.740
We've got them at the base.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.141
But that's a half an hour away.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.810
We need to get to mark's house.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.344
Good god, how many times

34:41.346 --> 34:43.146
Are you going to play
right into his hands?

34:43.148 --> 34:44.281
We should figure
something out here.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.615
I do not want to go to him.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.284
I know I shoved him
down your throats,

34:47.286 --> 34:48.819
But please trust me.

34:52.323 --> 34:54.424
I'm gonna need a sidearm.

35:01.732 --> 35:04.101
(alarm whooping, tires squeal)

35:04.103 --> 35:07.170
Warning system!
Three minutes till a meltdown!

35:07.172 --> 35:08.805
It's two minutes and 12 seconds,
actually!

35:12.844 --> 35:15.145
Walker:
What the hell is this?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.613
This is our
only chance.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.815
Paige:
Walter!
Happy:
Why is an alarm going off?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.884
Because we have two minutes
to avoid a meltdown.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.122
I need your
access codes

35:25.124 --> 35:26.890
For the antennas
to send an analog signal.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.194
(typing)

35:34.599 --> 35:37.267
Didn't work, mark.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.735
Mark, it didn't work.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.670
Why you looking at me
like that, walter?

35:40.672 --> 35:42.405
I need the code.
That's all we need.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.274
That's the same look
you gave me the day

35:44.276 --> 35:47.444
That the ambulance came
to take me away for two years.

35:47.446 --> 35:48.612
The code, collins.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.614
Nine-five-one.

35:53.451 --> 35:54.551
No, that's not it.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.419
Could've sworn it was 951.

35:56.421 --> 35:57.587
Walter:
951 days ago,

35:57.589 --> 35:58.688
Mark and I
disproved

35:58.690 --> 36:00.724
A section of
the higgs boson theory.

36:00.726 --> 36:01.858
Collins:
Excellent work!

36:01.860 --> 36:03.426
It's 1199.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.295
What is happening here?

36:08.566 --> 36:10.400
Collins:
I know walter found out
that I set this whole thing up.

36:10.402 --> 36:11.601
I was listening
to your conversation

36:11.603 --> 36:12.602
At the reactor base.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.870
The whole place
is mic'd.

36:13.872 --> 36:14.905
Just over a minute left!

36:14.907 --> 36:15.906
What the hell's the holdup?

36:15.908 --> 36:17.574
Just give us
the damn code!

36:17.576 --> 36:19.676
Or what?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.278
You'll shoot me?

36:22.446 --> 36:25.448
That only guarantees
you'll fail.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.485
Walter, how do you stand
for such intellectual inferiors?

36:28.487 --> 36:30.420
The code!
Collins:
I told you.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.289
It's 1199.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.456
Walter :
One-one-nine-nine.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.358
1,199 days ago--

36:35.360 --> 36:37.460
It was may 20,
it was a Thursday--

36:37.462 --> 36:39.429
We stayed up
all night in a diner

36:39.431 --> 36:42.432
Discussing the quantum mechanics
of time travel.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.867
We could have accomplished
anything together,

36:43.869 --> 36:45.268
But you ruined that.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.503
You hate me for what I did.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.572
I get it.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.740
And I always debate my decision,

36:50.742 --> 36:52.275
But this isn't the
right solution.

36:52.277 --> 36:55.212
And having me locked up was?

36:55.214 --> 36:57.581
Do you have any idea
how badly that hurt me?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.817
(alarm whooping sharply)

37:00.819 --> 37:02.352
There's less than a minute.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.820
Do you think
I'm afraid to die, walter?

37:03.822 --> 37:05.889
I'm not afraid to die.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.658
My life ended
the day that you destroyed

37:08.660 --> 37:10.460
Our partnership, our friendship.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.929
I just wanted to show you
that I could save everyone.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.631
I just wanted back on the team.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.534
The day his life ended,
the day he lost you.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.002
Seven hundred
and eighty-two days.

37:19.004 --> 37:19.903
What's the date?!

37:19.905 --> 37:21.871
August 22, 2012!

37:21.873 --> 37:23.673
No!
(gunshot)

37:23.675 --> 37:25.942
(collins groaning)

37:25.944 --> 37:27.577
Look out,
sylvester!

37:27.579 --> 37:29.279
Come on, come on...

37:30.581 --> 37:32.415
All right,
code's in, signal's up.

37:34.552 --> 37:35.852
Did it work?

37:35.854 --> 37:36.853
Walter?

37:36.855 --> 37:39.022
(alarm whooping)

37:45.396 --> 37:47.397
(alarm fades away)

37:47.399 --> 37:48.632
We're good.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.867
(exhales)
oh...

37:50.869 --> 37:52.535
I know this might be awkward,

37:52.537 --> 37:55.005
But I, for one, am against
mark rejoining the team.

37:57.575 --> 37:59.042
The wound was
through and through.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.645
They just brought him back
from the hospital.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.580
I should have kept a
closer eye on collins.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.814
Well, why didn't you?

38:04.816 --> 38:06.716
I was focused
on the upgrade.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.885
You were focused
on a friend.

38:08.887 --> 38:12.389
You were trying to make right
what happened between you guys.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.890
So you trusted him.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.659
That implies I feel guilt.

38:15.661 --> 38:19.929
Acting like a human being
is never a mistake.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.698
Means you're evolving.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.868
It's nice to see that
you're capable of that.

38:34.945 --> 38:36.946
Collins:
This is pretty
ironic, isn't it?

38:36.948 --> 38:39.316
First day I see you in years...

38:41.986 --> 38:44.020
...I'm back to lockup.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.461
I showed you the outer limits
of your intelligence

38:51.463 --> 38:53.330
And you couldn't handle it.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.700
You couldn't risk me,
or anybody else,

38:56.702 --> 38:59.336
Jeopardizing your team,
your precious cyclone.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.104
They are worth it.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.640
Why them?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.875
Toby, happy,
sylvester...

39:05.877 --> 39:07.944
They can't touch
my abilities.

39:07.946 --> 39:11.014
So why wasn't there room
for one more?

39:11.016 --> 39:12.482
But there was.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.883
Paige.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.385
She binds us.

39:18.589 --> 39:20.757
I'm going away.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.460
But I'll get out...

39:26.497 --> 39:29.532
Maybe I'll see you back
down the rabbit hole, walter.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.869
I... Hope not.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.877
â™ª

39:49.720 --> 39:51.087
Hey.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.622
Hey.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.825
I never... Thanked you

39:55.827 --> 39:58.061
For what you did for me
back then, with collins.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.698
Pulling me away
from that darkness.

40:01.700 --> 40:05.435
I didn't do it for a thank you.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.837
I did it because you're...

40:07.839 --> 40:08.838
My friend.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.174
I won't let you down again.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.710
So, um...

40:13.712 --> 40:16.045
Toby going after collins

40:16.047 --> 40:18.648
To protect your honor?

40:18.650 --> 40:19.849
What was all that about?

40:19.851 --> 40:22.118
The shrink's crazier
than all of us.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.153
What a surprise.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.622
â™ª

40:37.134 --> 40:39.169
Hey, everyone.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.137
Walter:
Hey. Uh, did we have, uh,

40:41.139 --> 40:42.739
A meeting scheduled? I...

40:42.741 --> 40:43.973
No. No, we just

40:43.975 --> 40:45.508
Dropped by.

40:45.510 --> 40:46.776
Because even after you

40:46.778 --> 40:48.678
Save the world, you're still
all lost in thought,

40:48.680 --> 40:50.814
Doing your own
separate projects.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.482
Tonight we have
a group project.

40:52.484 --> 40:53.716
Chicken piccata.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.785
I don't think we have
a chicken thermometer.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.854
Well, pizza would be
more efficient.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.156
We're all going to get out
of our own heads for a while

41:00.158 --> 41:01.724
And cook italian.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.793
Sounds fine.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.966
Um, can you just...

41:11.902 --> 41:13.870
Okay.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.707
If you're trying me out to see
if I work with this team...

41:17.709 --> 41:19.676
Paige...
If that's what's happening,
and that it could

41:19.678 --> 41:21.511
End up being a failure
and I could get

41:21.513 --> 41:23.746
Discarded one day,
just tell me.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.648
I can handle it.
But don't do it to ralph.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.852
He's grown attached to the
team-- especially you-- and I

41:28.854 --> 41:31.688
Don't want to see him hurt.
You are one of us.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.157
We can't do this without you.

41:35.593 --> 41:36.793
Good?

41:37.761 --> 41:40.663
Let's go cook
some chicken piccata.

41:41.765 --> 41:44.234
Measure twice,
cut once.

41:44.236 --> 41:47.237
Can we talk about the so-called
extra virgin olive oil industry?

41:47.239 --> 41:48.905
Beaucoup fraud.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.276
(chuckles)
kid's a natural.

41:53.278 --> 41:56.279
