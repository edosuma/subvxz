01:32.126 --> 01:33.859
Confession.

01:33.861 --> 01:37.296
The reconciliation of the
penitent.

01:39.867 --> 01:43.535
It is one of the greatest gifts
the Church has to offer,

01:43.537 --> 01:45.771
and must never be entered into
lightly.

01:45.773 --> 01:52.277
To do so is to participate in the
pernicious sin of contempt of the holy.

01:52.279 --> 01:57.716
As a priest, we are privileged
to minister this sacrament

01:57.718 --> 02:00.586
this profound act of...

02:00.588 --> 02:06.191
blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.631
I hate it.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.368
I mean in practice not in
theory. In theory...

02:16.370 --> 02:20.839
it is a beautiful act of
contrition and redemption

02:20.841 --> 02:25.711
in reality, I am trapped inside
this tiny box for hours

02:25.713 --> 02:28.948
sitting on a hard wooden chair

02:28.949 --> 02:32.184
listening to the inane
regurgitation of rote sins till

02:32.186 --> 02:36.221
my butt is numb and my mind
mush.

02:36.223 --> 02:40.859
So... when the bishop decides
that every perish in the diocese

02:40.861 --> 02:44.897
will have an extended three
hour session of confession every

02:44.899 --> 02:48.634
Friday night my first reaction--

02:48.636 --> 02:50.502
heck my secondary

02:50.504 --> 02:53.338
my tertiary reaction

02:53.340 --> 02:57.309
isn't yaaaay.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.746
It's not that I find confession
boring.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.481
It's not boredom,

03:02.483 --> 03:04.349
it's hate.

03:04.351 --> 03:08.887
I hate it. Hate. A genuine hate.

03:08.889 --> 03:14.259
And it's not that I don't care about the
spiritual well-being of my parishioners.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.428
I do.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.596
That's partially why I hate it.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.301
Of course I didn't always feel
like this.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.571
In my early days I was excited
about confession.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.941
In fact, I used to worry that I
was too excited

03:28.943 --> 03:34.446
that I would derive some sort of
sick pleasure in hearing confession

03:34.448 --> 03:40.619
that it'd be titillating in some way
listening to people bare their souls.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.954
That I'd revel in it

03:41.956 --> 03:46.858
That I'd chew on those morsel
bits of gossip.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.394
I don't worry about that any
more.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.497
Turns out I'm not a thirteen
year old girl

03:52.499 --> 03:57.002
and gossip is not genuine
gossip when it's firsthand.

03:57.004 --> 04:01.223
It's sterile, clinical.

04:01.224 --> 04:05.443
It's the difference between a striptease and
dropping your pants in front of a doctor.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.480
I assume.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.954
I suppose it just starts to
wear on you.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.390
Confess, confess, confess,

04:18.392 --> 04:20.791
and then they're back the next
week.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.861
And the week after that.

04:22.863 --> 04:28.834
And the week after that. And
the week after that until...

04:28.836 --> 04:33.872
You start to wonder, did they
even mean it?

04:34.942 --> 04:40.279
And that makes you wonder a lot
of things...

04:40.981 --> 04:46.685
Well at least confession is
still good for self-reflection.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.900
Honestly, what is the appeal of
the new atheists?

05:01.902 --> 05:07.506
Just a retreading of old arguments,
only less eloquently stated.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.292
Try Sartre,

05:10.293 --> 05:13.077
the arguments are still wobbly,
but it makes for a better read.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.516
Father

05:17.518 --> 05:18.917
Rupert Finnegan.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.519
Successful businessman.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.688
Well respected by those who
know him least.

05:22.690 --> 05:27.359
Always the first to confession,
always opts for face to face confession --

05:27.361 --> 05:29.961
a type of confession that is
actually somewhat common

05:29.963 --> 05:37.969
a fact you may be oblivious to if your
sole source of Catholicism was the movies.

05:37.971 --> 05:42.607
O God, who by your Holy Spirit
make perfect the elect,

05:42.609 --> 05:46.712
pour your heavenly light into the
hearts of these your penitent servants,

05:46.714 --> 05:50.015
that they may know and
acknowledge all -- all,

05:50.017 --> 05:54.052
their sins -- every single one
of them...

05:54.054 --> 05:55.687
...every sin against you,

05:55.689 --> 05:59.891
and, confessing and forsaking
them, may obtain mercy

05:59.893 --> 06:02.461
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.829
Amen

06:03.831 --> 06:08.200
Bless me Father for I have
sinned,

06:08.201 --> 06:12.570
it has been one week since my last confession,
I accuse myself of the following sins.

06:12.573 --> 06:16.541
I lost my temper at another
driver.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.977
He was merging and almost--

06:18.979 --> 06:24.649
Not a mortal sin, no need to
give me the details.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.684
Um...

06:25.686 --> 06:29.521
Well... I broke the law.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.390
I - I sped.

06:31.392 --> 06:35.427
All week... to and from work.

06:35.429 --> 06:40.932
Maybe five miles, perhaps ten
miles over the speed limit.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.102
He also cheats on his wife.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.606
I know this because his
mistress confesses it to me.

06:47.608 --> 06:53.111
Not explicitly, but it doesn't take
Father Brown to put it together.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.580
I was uncharitable.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.151
Father Brown is a fictional
character by G.K. Chesterton.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.570
He solved mysteries --

07:01.571 --> 07:03.988
sorry -- I just thought that
reference was a bit obscure.

07:03.991 --> 07:12.164
I didn't want you to think that Father Brown was some
highly intuitive priest in the diocese or something.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.700
I saw a homeless man on the
street

07:15.702 --> 07:24.643
and I thought I should give him
my spare change. But I didn't.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.745
Um...

07:26.747 --> 07:30.933
I also lied.

07:30.934 --> 07:35.120
My friend asked me to help him tear
out his deck, and I said I couldn't...

07:35.122 --> 07:37.522
I guess that's about it.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.890
-That's it?

07:38.892 --> 07:41.293
Yeah.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.695
No more sins you might want to
unburden yourself with?

07:46.934 --> 07:47.966
No.

07:47.968 --> 07:53.905
So speeding, lying,
and not giving change to a homeless man?

07:53.907 --> 07:57.676
Well that's all I can think of
at the moment.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.711
Well, there may be some others.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.546
-But those are the biggies?

08:01.548 --> 08:05.517
Yeah, those are the ones I can
think of at the moment.

08:05.519 --> 08:09.721
Well... I'll give you a minute.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.962
Nothing comes to mind.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.197
Maybe something sexual, perhaps.

08:19.199 --> 08:23.935
Pornography for instance is a
problem in our society.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.004
Are you, you know...

08:26.006 --> 08:27.806
Click, click, click?

08:27.808 --> 08:30.509
I have a content blocker on the
internet.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.078
-Oh.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.645
Well, who needs the internet with the way
women are dressing these days, am I right?

08:35.649 --> 08:41.152
With their high skirts, low cut
shirts, you can see their whole...

08:41.154 --> 08:42.187
regions.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.056
Is that a problem for you?

08:46.693 --> 08:50.762
Sounds like it might be a
problem for you Father.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
I'm sorry Father.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.903
It just that description was...

08:58.539 --> 09:01.006
very vivid.

09:03.176 --> 09:08.647
But no, I don't have a problem
with that.

09:08.649 --> 09:14.219
I suppose I'm... just -- I'm
just blessed that way.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.255
Right. Blessed.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.790
But if it were a problem--

09:18.792 --> 09:21.493
It's not.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.195
- But if it were a problem you should confess
it, because lust is a serious issue.

09:24.197 --> 09:30.769
You know, Jesus said anyone who lusts after
a woman in his heart commits adultery.

09:30.771 --> 09:34.606
And we all know how serious
adultery is.

09:37.177 --> 09:41.046
That's so true Father.

09:42.015 --> 09:47.252
Now if you could make an
act of contrition

09:48.589 --> 09:53.725
O dear God, I'm heartily sorry
for having offended Thee

09:53.727 --> 09:57.329
And I detest all my sins because
I dread the loss of heaven

09:57.331 --> 10:02.901
and the pains of hell; but most
of all, for having offended Thee

10:02.903 --> 10:06.989
Massive prick

10:06.990 --> 10:11.076
And his wife is such a beautiful
woman, so tender nad love, and...

10:11.078 --> 10:12.844
Well, she doesn't deserve this.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.981
- I firmly resolve with the help
of thy grace

10:15.983 --> 10:20.752
to sin no more and to avoid the
near occasions of sin.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.621
Amen

10:24.124 --> 10:24.990
Father?

10:24.992 --> 10:25.890
Hmm?

10:25.892 --> 10:27.025
My penance?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.944
-Ah. Right.

10:28.945 --> 10:30.862
Three Hail Mary's, and three
Our Father's--

10:30.864 --> 10:33.965
Three Hail Mary's and three Our
Fathers?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.101
-You're right--

10:36.102 --> 10:38.236
three Hail Mary's, six Our
Father's, a decade of the Rosary.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.306
And shove it up your anus.

11:41.435 --> 11:42.901
Oh, shit.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.938
You uh... you here for
confession?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.577
Um...

11:52.578 --> 11:54.144
isn't this supposed to be
anonymous?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.147
Door number two.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.349
You can go around if you want.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.485
What would be the point of that
now?

12:00.487 --> 12:03.922
If it makes you more
comfortable.

12:05.158 --> 12:10.395
Nah, I'm not really...

12:10.397 --> 12:13.098
Take a seat.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.437
Or don't.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.475
Alright.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.187
So...

12:36.189 --> 12:38.323
Like, how does this work?

12:38.325 --> 12:44.829
Well, it's customary to begin with
"Bless me Father for I have sinned."

12:44.831 --> 12:46.798
But you have like rules though,
right?

12:46.800 --> 12:50.401
Like you can't tell anyone about
what is said during this, right?

12:50.403 --> 12:51.736
Right.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.070
Like no matter what, right?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.506
No matter what.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.940
Like, even if it's really bad?

12:55.942 --> 12:57.142
Even then.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.810
Like, even if it's like
illegal?

12:58.812 --> 13:01.813
Even then.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.815
Like nothing? Like not at all?
Like even if it's super illegal?

13:04.818 --> 13:08.787
Infractions, misdemeanors,
felonies, you're covered.

13:08.789 --> 13:17.095
Okay, even if I was like Hitler and I was telling you,
"yeah, I've been killing like a lot of Jews lately?

13:17.097 --> 13:23.067
Like, shoving them into ovens and
shit." You wouldn't tell anyone?

13:24.004 --> 13:28.039
The seal of confession is
absolute.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.762
That's messed up.

13:33.763 --> 13:36.514
And have you been,
"like killing a lot of Jews" lately?

13:38.285 --> 13:40.769
No.

13:40.770 --> 13:43.254
Then maybe we should stick to
your confession.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.558
Alright.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.596
I killed someone.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.533
No you didn't.
- What do you mean, "no I didn't?"

13:56.536 --> 13:59.404
I mean precisely that.
- Yeah, I did.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.438
No you didn't.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.940
Yes. I did.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.442
Do you want to make a real
confession? Or not?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.579
You cannot tell me what my
confessions are.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.181
You could start with the sin of
lying.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.316
What kind of priest are you?

14:11.318 --> 14:13.418
I'm telling you, I killed a
guy.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.020
Fine. Alright. Who'd you kill?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.407
A man.

14:19.408 --> 14:20.524
Just a man? Just a random man?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.861
Yeah, like a homeless
guy.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.462
What'd he look like?

14:24.464 --> 14:25.563
Homeless.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.098
How tall?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.767
Like normal height.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.435
Uh-huh. And why'd you kill him?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.036
He was giving me shit.

14:32.038 --> 14:32.937
Literally?

14:32.939 --> 14:34.272
He was hassling me.

14:34.274 --> 14:38.109
Ah, well that seems equitable.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.245
How'd you kill him?

14:40.247 --> 14:41.946
I stabbed him.

14:41.948 --> 14:45.450
Ouch. With a knife?

14:45.451 --> 14:48.953
Yeah, of course with a knife. What the
fuck else do you think I stabbed him with?

14:48.955 --> 14:50.421
What kind of knife was it?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.522
I don't know. A knife.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.425
Was it his knife or your knife?

14:54.427 --> 14:55.760
His.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.094
How'd you get the knife from
him?

14:57.097 --> 15:00.465
Just took it from him.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.018
Wow.

15:03.019 --> 15:05.570
Yeah. He was coming at me, so I
just--

15:08.174 --> 15:09.407
Where?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.575
On the street.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.678
No, I mean where on his body.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.031
In the throat.

15:16.032 --> 15:18.383
Ah because you were mime
stabbing below his throat.

15:18.385 --> 15:23.054
Are you sure that he was normal
height?

15:26.459 --> 15:30.061
Must have been a lot of blood.

15:30.062 --> 15:33.664
Yeah, pretty nasty stuff.
You wouldn't want to know about that.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.068
Fair enough. So you killed him,
then what?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.971
Then I thought I should
confess, and here I am.

15:39.973 --> 15:46.110
And here you are. Curiously
without a drop of blood on you.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.379
Well I washed up.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.516
Pretty thoroughly it would seem,

15:51.518 --> 15:55.036
and yet oddly

15:55.037 --> 15:58.555
not well enough to remove that
club stamp from your hand.

16:00.427 --> 16:07.298
Alright, I confess, I didn't
kill anyone.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.418
You're pretty good.

16:10.419 --> 16:12.469
Yeah, I'm a regular Father
Brown.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.504
Who?

16:13.506 --> 16:17.575
I need to ask you to leave now.

16:17.577 --> 16:21.412
What?

16:21.413 --> 16:25.248
This may be a joke to you, but we take the
sacrament of confession very seriously.

16:29.456 --> 16:33.491
Well are you going to leave?

16:34.995 --> 16:40.765
I don't think so.

16:40.766 --> 16:46.536
Other people who actually want to participate
in this sacrament need to use the confessional.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.273
Hello? Hello?

16:49.275 --> 16:51.476
Is anyone there?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.347
No one's there

16:56.349 --> 16:58.216
-Even so.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.286
You need to leave.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.054
No.

17:03.056 --> 17:03.521
-No?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.756
No.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.392
You're refusing to leave?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.560
-Looks that way.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.664
Well, this is a new one

17:13.665 --> 17:17.068
You're just going to sit there?

17:18.070 --> 17:19.737
Guess so.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.574
Alright

17:24.577 --> 17:31.082
I give her about five minutes
before she's bored out of her mind.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.651
Doesn't that hurt?

18:40.653 --> 18:41.686
Huh?

18:41.688 --> 18:44.555
Your wrist. Doesn't that hurt?

18:44.557 --> 18:45.456
Kinda.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.725
Then why do you do it?

18:48.228 --> 18:54.365
I don't know. I like it. A
little pain can be nice.

18:54.367 --> 18:59.270
-Mmm. Present company excluded.

19:10.917 --> 19:14.318
Okay. You need to leave now.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.003
No.

19:16.004 --> 19:17.687
There's somebody else here for
confession.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.157
So?

19:19.159 --> 19:21.292
So you need to leave.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.860
You leave.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.762
This is my confessional.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.863
So?

19:25.865 --> 19:28.766
In my head that was a stronger
point.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.201
Get out.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.636
No.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.070
I mean it. Get out.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.504
You get out. Take the
confession out there.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.375
I can't. What if they're here
anonymously?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.756
That side's open.

19:40.757 --> 19:44.136
They're not gonna come in, if
you're in here --

19:44.137 --> 19:47.516
I'm not arguing this with you. This is not a debate. You
are going to get up, right now, and you are going to exit.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.452
Or what?

19:48.454 --> 19:49.720
-Or what?

19:49.722 --> 19:51.789
Yeah, what are you gonna do
about it?

19:51.791 --> 19:54.692
You're gonna put a hex on me?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.661
A hex? I'm not a voodoo priest.

19:56.663 --> 20:00.831
Then what are you gonna do
about it?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.901
Okay, young lady.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.637
Oh yeah

20:07.674 --> 20:09.473
Oh Father, yes!

20:09.475 --> 20:10.641
-Are you insane!

20:10.643 --> 20:11.943
Say you're sorry

20:11.945 --> 20:14.763
What?

20:14.764 --> 20:17.582
Oh -- oh yeah on the floor or
in the confessional

20:17.584 --> 20:19.317
you dirty boy

20:19.319 --> 20:21.719
You were mean to me. Say you're
sorry

20:21.721 --> 20:24.288
Never

20:24.289 --> 20:26.856
Oh yes. Harder. Yes! Down
sideways all over pound me!

20:26.859 --> 20:30.528
Okay -- okay, I say I'm sorry
and you'll leave?

20:30.530 --> 20:33.231
Yes. YES!

20:33.233 --> 20:37.535
Okay, I'm sorry.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.451
Father Whelan.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.986
-Wh--what are you doing here?

20:54.988 --> 20:58.422
Confession. What do you think?

20:59.559 --> 21:03.327
That... that was just a prank.
A bit of a--

21:03.329 --> 21:06.364
It's my confession Father, not
yours.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.667
Really it is just a prank.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.569
I believe you.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.740
Shall we?

21:15.742 --> 21:17.642
Father

21:17.644 --> 21:19.944
- Bless me Father, for I have
sinned.

21:19.946 --> 21:25.416
It has been three days since my
last confession.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.753
And these are my sins.

21:29.589 --> 21:34.492
Father Whelan is one of the oldest and
most respected priests in the diocese.

21:34.494 --> 21:38.029
I've taken his confession
before and he's taken mine.

21:38.031 --> 21:41.699
Priests confess to one another,
that's normal

21:41.701 --> 21:43.968
though... not usually at this
hour.

21:43.970 --> 21:50.641
We don't generally want to take away the
allotted confession time from the laity.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.678
Recently I've had a very heavy
temptation

21:53.680 --> 21:59.083
Deep and penetrating like it's
been gnawing at my bones.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.819
A few months ago, a member of
my church

22:01.821 --> 22:07.558
a very, very lovely, devout
lady -- lost a child.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.279
A little boy.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.699
Terrible accident and so naturally I
went to her, I tried to strengthen her

22:14.701 --> 22:20.037
I tried to give her comfort as
best I could.

22:21.107 --> 22:26.944
But her reception was always
just very, very cold.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.547
That's to be expected.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.416
Yes. Expected.

22:32.418 --> 22:36.887
But still I prayed for her, I
prayed with her.

22:36.889 --> 22:42.660
I prayed for peace. I prayed for
her strength and understanding

22:42.662 --> 22:48.432
I spoke with her about the
glories of suffering

22:48.434 --> 22:50.434
about...

22:50.436 --> 22:53.938
all of the treasures in heaven,

22:53.940 --> 22:58.042
and about the perseverance of
the saints.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.878
And then eventually on one
visit...

23:00.880 --> 23:04.648
She turned and she looked at me.

23:05.518 --> 23:10.788
Straight in my eye and she said

23:10.790 --> 23:14.024
You could never understand

23:14.627 --> 23:17.061
-You've never had a child

23:17.063 --> 23:21.966
you could never understand my
loss

23:23.102 --> 23:25.669
She didn't just speak it

23:25.671 --> 23:27.638
she snarled it

23:28.674 --> 23:30.641
She was in pain

23:31.844 --> 23:34.111
Don't misunderstand me, I
didn't begrudge her.

23:34.113 --> 23:39.817
Even as she began to drift from
the church I didn't begrudge her.

23:39.819 --> 23:48.659
You know, it's been fifty-two
years since my ordination.

23:48.661 --> 23:53.597
I've given a great deal for the
cause.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.833
I never had wealth.

23:55.835 --> 24:01.138
I never had a fancy car, or a
fancy house.

24:02.008 --> 24:06.444
I never took exotic vacations.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.447
Never got married.

24:09.449 --> 24:15.753
Never had children, and... and
never had grandchildren.

24:15.755 --> 24:22.760
And for the huge deep sacrifice I
considered for the sake of Christ

24:22.762 --> 24:27.565
my parishioner considered it a
deficit in me.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.867
My sacrifice.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.969
And it is a sacrifice.

24:31.971 --> 24:36.073
We choose a life of sacrifice,
you and I.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.043
And now as I...

24:39.045 --> 24:46.217
near the end of my race and...
the end of my time here on earth

24:46.219 --> 24:49.220
I'm beginning to wonder

24:49.222 --> 24:52.022
Was it all worth it?

24:53.926 --> 24:56.260
Well, Father...

24:56.262 --> 24:58.195
Was it?

24:58.931 --> 25:03.601
Of course. Immeasurably.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.536
-Immeasurably?

25:07.874 --> 25:10.140
I have my doubts.

25:10.142 --> 25:15.579
And that Father, is my sin.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.751
Your act of contrition.

25:20.753 --> 25:24.588
I've prayed it all week.

25:27.994 --> 25:32.296
God the Father of mercies,
through the death and resurrection

25:32.298 --> 25:35.266
of his Son, has reconciled the
world to himself

25:35.268 --> 25:39.770
and sent the Holy Spirit among
us for the forgiveness of sins.

25:39.772 --> 25:45.876
Through the ministry of the church,
may God grant you pardon and peace.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.546
And I absolve you of your sins,

25:48.548 --> 25:56.887
in the name of the Father, and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.665
Father Whelan...

26:09.268 --> 26:10.968
Your penance.

26:12.004 --> 26:16.340
I know my penance.

26:33.826 --> 26:34.825
Okay, look...

26:35.928 --> 26:37.128
Out.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.329
That was not cool, I know that.

26:38.331 --> 26:40.581
Out.

26:40.582 --> 26:42.832
- Hey! Fucksake, I'm trying to
say I'm sorry, okay?

26:42.835 --> 26:48.105
Aren't you supposed to be forgiving?
Isn't that like, the point?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.641
Okay, I forgive you. Now get
out.

26:50.643 --> 26:53.177
Did you see the look on that
old guy's face?

26:53.179 --> 26:56.680
Yes. As a matter of fact, I
did.

26:56.682 --> 26:59.116
Almost as priceless as yours.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.953
You religious types are so
uptight about sex.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.656
Why are you sitting?

27:05.657 --> 27:08.358
I mean, it's just sex. It's not
a big deal.

27:08.361 --> 27:11.045
Have you ever had sex?

27:11.046 --> 27:13.730
You're not leaving. Why aren't
you leaving?

27:13.733 --> 27:17.167
- I mean, other than teenage
boys?

27:17.169 --> 27:21.021
Here we go...

27:21.022 --> 27:24.874
Yes, of course, every priest is a pedophile. I choose
my altar boys based on their little head shots.

27:24.877 --> 27:29.179
Do you know, the number of pedophile
priests is infinitesimally small,

27:29.181 --> 27:32.316
but hey, let's not let facts or reason
get in the way of knocking the Church.

27:32.318 --> 27:38.355
And I'm not minimizing what happened -- it was terrible,
it was horrible, inexcusable -- but my goodness

27:38.357 --> 27:45.329
by that standard you must think that every college football
coach is a pedophile, or every Hollywood film director

27:45.331 --> 27:50.234
and at least we do not give our
pedophiles awards!

27:52.238 --> 27:54.672
It was a joke.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.408
Sorry. You touched a nerve.

27:57.410 --> 28:00.944
Like the way you touch little
boys?

28:03.849 --> 28:08.352
Okay. Alright, alright, you
don't touch little boys.

28:08.354 --> 28:17.227
But... have you ever touched a woman -- and
I don't mean recently, I mean like ever?

28:17.229 --> 28:19.463
Have you ever had sex?

28:19.465 --> 28:22.433
I'm not discussing this with
you.

28:22.435 --> 28:25.202
Ugh, see? So uptight.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.037
This is not uptight

28:27.039 --> 28:28.439
Are you embarrassed?

28:28.441 --> 28:29.306
No--

28:29.308 --> 28:30.407
I won't laugh.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.142
Why aren't you leaving!?

28:32.144 --> 28:34.812
I'm interested.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.980
Have you had sex?

28:36.982 --> 28:38.866
Please leave.

28:38.867 --> 28:40.751
Why won't you answer the question?
I promise I will not laugh.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.420
I have asked you nicely to
leave.

28:43.422 --> 28:47.958
And I've asked you nicely if
you've ever had sex.

28:50.329 --> 28:55.933
No. Okay? No, I haven't had sex.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.040
That's so weird.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.658
-Uh-huh.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.275
You're so old. That's so crazy.

29:06.278 --> 29:12.516
Oh, so it's "just sex", no big deal. But it's
somehow a big deal that I haven't had it?

29:12.518 --> 29:16.854
Well, which is it? Is sex a big
deal or isn't it a big deal?

29:16.856 --> 29:22.159
Because if it isn't a big deal, then why
is it a big deal that I haven't had it?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.762
I dunno. It just is.

29:24.764 --> 29:28.132
I don't know what I'd do
without sex. I love sex.

29:28.134 --> 29:32.136
- You shouldn't even be having sex.
You look like a child. How old are you?

29:32.138 --> 29:34.838
Screw you, I'm twenty-one.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.041
Yeah, let me see a license.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.877
Does your father know you're
having sex?

29:39.879 --> 29:42.663
No.

29:42.664 --> 29:45.448
Well you should stop. Wait till you're married.
It's the right thing to do and it's better for you.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.417
Married people have better sex
anyway.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.787
-Yeah? Says who? You?

29:49.789 --> 29:50.954
-Studies.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.289
Bullshit.

29:52.291 --> 29:56.126
Numerous studies.

29:56.127 --> 29:59.962
Married people have more sex than those who
aren't, and are more sexually fulfilled.

29:59.965 --> 30:04.518
Bullshit.

30:04.519 --> 30:09.072
It's true. All of those sexual liberation
things -- it's a joke. Causes nothing but pain.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.225
And pleasure.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.377
- A little pleasure, followed by
a lot of pain.

30:13.379 --> 30:16.697
Then you're doing it wrong.

30:16.698 --> 30:20.016
Well not you, obviously, but
those studies are.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.286
What about oral?

30:22.288 --> 30:23.487
What?

30:23.489 --> 30:24.855
Have you ever had oral?

30:24.856 --> 30:26.222
I already told you, I haven't
had sex.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.058
Oral's not sex.

30:28.059 --> 30:29.892
Oh? What you're referring to...
oral hygiene?

30:29.895 --> 30:35.299
Yes, oral sex, is sex, it's right there
in the title. It's part of the definition.

30:35.301 --> 30:38.969
Okay. What about a hand jibber?

30:38.971 --> 30:42.239
A what?

30:42.240 --> 30:45.508
You know, a handjob. Stroking
the pope hat.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.179
Stop doing that.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.547
No.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.084
Slight lie.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.286
Jennifer Conner in the eleventh
grade.

30:56.288 --> 31:03.994
I... still think about it -- her,
I still think about her from time to time.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.997
Have you ever even kissed a
girl?

31:06.999 --> 31:08.198
Yes.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.300
And not just your mom?

31:10.302 --> 31:11.201
Yes.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.637
Awww. Who'd you kiss?

31:13.639 --> 31:16.173
I had a girlfriend in high
school.

31:16.175 --> 31:21.545
Awww. She dump you, is that why
you became a priest?

31:21.547 --> 31:26.450
That's what you think isn't it?

31:26.451 --> 31:31.354
The only way you could fathom how anyone could possibly
choose a life of celibacy and dedication to God

31:31.357 --> 31:35.893
is in a state of crippling
emotional despair.

31:35.895 --> 31:39.263
Well, let me enlighten you,

31:39.264 --> 31:42.632
there is far more to life than the
shallow interrelations of boys and girls

31:42.635 --> 31:48.505
or the world's juvenile,
insatiate obsession with carnal lust.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.275
The very notion that the
mashing of genitals

31:51.277 --> 31:56.046
can hold a candle to the richness that
is found in relationship to Christ

31:56.048 --> 32:00.284
or the eternal significance of
service to his calling

32:00.286 --> 32:04.454
is absurd and obscene, and
frankly, offensive.

32:04.456 --> 32:12.329
I chose this life from a fullness of
heart, not a broken one.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.333
Okay. So, she dumped you.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.270
Yes.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.674
But that is not why I'm a
priest.

32:29.515 --> 32:34.084
Yeah, I dumped my boyfriend too.

32:34.086 --> 32:37.988
He didn't really seem to care
how I felt or... you know.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.490
Yeah. Well, it's probably for
the best.

32:40.492 --> 32:44.161
Yeah, well he was being a real
asshole.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.229
Is that really necessary?

32:46.231 --> 32:46.997
-What?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.599
Your language.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.200
What? He was being an asshole.

32:50.202 --> 32:53.437
We're in the house of the Lord.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.673
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure God knows
he was being an asshole too.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.543
Even so.

33:06.385 --> 33:10.721
So, do just plan on sitting
here all night?

33:10.723 --> 33:14.224
What? You got somewhere you got
to be?

33:14.727 --> 33:16.393
No.

33:17.262 --> 33:22.132
Relax, if somebody comes in
I'll leave. Alright?

33:22.134 --> 33:24.167
You said that last time.

33:24.169 --> 33:28.138
Yeah, and I did leave...
eventually.

33:28.674 --> 33:34.077
I swear okay? I swear to God.
Okay?

33:34.079 --> 33:35.445
To God even.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.249
Okay.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.020
You know, you're not very
welcoming.

33:43.022 --> 33:47.057
This is why people don't like
religion.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.492
This is why?

33:48.494 --> 33:49.226
Yeah.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.293
This?

33:50.295 --> 33:52.796
Yeah.

33:52.797 --> 33:55.298
This? This scenario here is why
people don't like religion?

33:55.300 --> 33:58.835
Yeah.

33:58.836 --> 34:02.371
A priest being curt to an individual who
intentionally and maliciously tried to

34:02.374 --> 34:05.709
falsely portray said priest as
a sexual deviant

34:05.711 --> 34:11.481
is the reason people don't like religion? That's
what you're saying? That's your argument?

34:11.483 --> 34:15.252
Well, I'm saying it's in the
top ten at least.

34:15.254 --> 34:19.322
I see. So you actually liked
religion prior to this?

34:19.324 --> 34:23.592
I'm a spiritual person.
I just don't care for organized religion.

34:23.594 --> 34:28.098
So you're for disorganized
religion?

34:28.099 --> 34:32.601
You dislike that we meet at a designated time,
at a designated place in a coordinated fashion?

34:32.603 --> 34:36.739
No. What you mean is, you don't
favor doctrine.

34:36.742 --> 34:41.911
You dislike that we make truth
claims,

34:41.913 --> 34:47.083
that we say things about the nature of God and man,
and worse, that we make claims about right and wrong.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.205
Because God forbid that
morality were objective,

34:51.206 --> 34:55.324
and we actually find judgment to be a good and
useful tool for right living and a just society.

34:55.327 --> 35:03.700
Because if that were true you might actually
have a need for this box and this place.

35:03.702 --> 35:12.142
The empty-headed happiness of
vague spirituality is that way.

35:12.144 --> 35:17.181
I have no idea what you just
said.

35:17.182 --> 35:22.219
All I'm saying is that if you have no need for my
religion and my confessional, then you are free to leave.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.726
In fact, I encourage it.

35:37.603 --> 35:38.668
-Who's that?

35:38.670 --> 35:40.437
My mom.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.838
She know you're here?

35:41.840 --> 35:44.841
Yeah. It's fine.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.843
You fighting with her?

35:46.845 --> 35:47.844
No.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.686
What the hell do you want?

35:59.791 --> 36:01.258
Is everything alright in there?

36:01.260 --> 36:04.928
Yeah, yeah, I just missed the
kneeler thing.

36:04.930 --> 36:09.866
Alright. There we go. Bless me
Father, yadda, yadda...

36:09.868 --> 36:14.271
- Let me stop you right there son.
How much have you had to drink?

36:14.273 --> 36:17.374
Two beers officer and that is
it.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.310
You wish to be absolved of your
drunkenness?

36:20.312 --> 36:24.381
Hells yea. You know what --
my... my friend --

36:24.383 --> 36:30.787
I have a friend, and he says that
confession gets rid of hangovers.

36:30.789 --> 36:40.530
And I could really use that right about now,
because I got a job interview in the AM.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.769
Do you have any other mortal
sins you'd like to confess?

36:45.771 --> 36:47.504
Ugh, I don't know.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.973
Well listen, I'm going to call
you a cab.

36:49.975 --> 36:55.946
And when you're sober you can
come back to confession. Soon.

36:55.948 --> 37:00.750
Your penance is do without
alcohol for two weeks.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.219
What about my penis?

37:02.221 --> 37:04.554
Penance! Penance.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.457
Yes, hello, I'd like a cab...

37:09.494 --> 37:14.531
-Oh god.

37:14.533 --> 37:15.732
-Nevermind

37:26.945 --> 37:28.578
Oh, holy shit

37:28.580 --> 37:32.816
You're still here? Good. You
can give me a hand.

37:32.818 --> 37:36.887
I am not touching that.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.957
Of course, far be it for someone of your
generation to get their hands dirty.

37:40.959 --> 37:46.830
There's a drug store across the street.
Would you get me an air freshener?

37:46.832 --> 37:48.598
You can keep the change.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.735
All of it?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.303
What's gotten you so wound up?

37:53.305 --> 37:56.506
Are you going to do this for me
or not?

37:56.508 --> 37:58.642
Fine.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.944
I'll be your errand bitch.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.747
You're not my erra--

38:03.749 --> 38:08.385
And hurry. Please. Thank you.

38:31.576 --> 38:33.677
Here's your air freshener.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.046
Thank you.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.094
What?

38:51.095 --> 38:52.795
I dunno. You're acting funny.

38:52.798 --> 38:53.630
-Huh?

38:53.631 --> 38:54.463
-You're all jittery.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.333
I'm not jittery.

38:56.335 --> 38:59.169
You are jittery.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.004
I'm jittery because I want my
confessional to not smell like vomit?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.573
-No.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.711
Are we done here?

39:07.713 --> 39:10.547
Are you expecting someone?

39:10.549 --> 39:13.016
Yes. Parishioners.

39:13.018 --> 39:16.019
I think you should be on your
way now shouldn't you?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.455
I mean you've had your fun

39:18.456 --> 39:20.890
you've made your jokes, you've
had your kick

39:20.892 --> 39:22.726
that's enough right?

39:22.728 --> 39:28.932
Unless of course there's some
actual reason why you came here.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.770
Well?

39:37.909 --> 39:42.145
Thanks for the change Padre

39:57.896 --> 39:59.129
Mary.

39:59.131 --> 39:59.763
Hey.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.663
How are you?

40:00.665 --> 40:02.298
Good.

40:02.299 --> 40:03.932
Come in, come in, have a seat.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.602
Thanks.

40:05.604 --> 40:06.870
How are you?

40:06.872 --> 40:08.004
Good.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.839
Good.

40:18.083 --> 40:22.352
Mary Finnegan

40:22.353 --> 40:26.622
the only real fault in her, is who
she chose to marry -- massive prick.

40:27.426 --> 40:31.027
So... light traffic today?

40:31.029 --> 40:32.095
-Mmm?

40:32.097 --> 40:34.097
You're a bit early.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.098
Oh goodness, am I really that
boring and predictable?

40:36.101 --> 40:39.002
-No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

40:39.004 --> 40:40.770
No, no, it's fine--

40:40.772 --> 40:44.891
I don't think you're boring--

40:44.892 --> 40:49.011
Certainly seems boring. Isn't variety
supposed to be the spice of life?

40:49.014 --> 40:54.184
Well, you can substitute with
oregano.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.920
I suppose it's not the worst
thing to be boring.

40:56.922 --> 41:00.857
- Predictable. Not boring. Never
boring.

41:00.859 --> 41:05.128
Can anything be predictable,
and not boring?

41:05.130 --> 41:06.796
Of course.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.565
-Like what?

41:08.567 --> 41:10.800
The sunrise.

41:10.802 --> 41:16.473
Predictable. Not boring. Never
boring.

41:16.475 --> 41:20.210
You're just the sunrise.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.516
So... shall we get started?

41:27.085 --> 41:34.257
Bless me Father for I have sinned. It
has been a week since my last confession.

41:34.259 --> 41:37.827
These are my sins.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.128
I gossiped.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.199
I spoke poorly about a family
member of mine.

41:43.201 --> 41:47.570
And I enjoyed doing it.

41:47.572 --> 41:54.544
I had feelings of jealousy over
a friend of mine. Her life...

41:54.546 --> 41:59.249
it just... it just seems so
perfect,

41:59.251 --> 42:02.151
I can be resentful of it.

42:03.021 --> 42:06.723
Nobody has a perfect life.
Believe me.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.993
-Yeah, I suppose you would know.

42:09.995 --> 42:17.000
And uh... we all want things
that we don't have.

42:21.773 --> 42:24.941
What is it?

42:24.943 --> 42:28.278
I didn't want to come today.

42:28.280 --> 42:35.718
I've been struggling with
something, and I'm...

42:35.720 --> 42:38.555
well, I'm embarrassed.

42:38.557 --> 42:42.442
Don't be.

42:42.443 --> 42:46.328
I thought about confessing anonymously, but
seeing as how I'm such a creature of habit...

42:46.331 --> 42:53.269
I'm sure you would have noticed my
absence, or recognized my voice.

42:53.271 --> 42:56.039
Mary, this is a safe place.

42:56.041 --> 43:00.677
You can tell me anything. It
won't leave here.

43:02.147 --> 43:05.882
I've been having impure
thoughts about a man.

43:05.884 --> 43:13.356
And uh... do you immediately pray to
banish these thoughts and temptations?

43:13.992 --> 43:16.626
I enjoy them.

43:16.628 --> 43:20.630
Often times I don't even feel
guilty.

43:20.632 --> 43:23.032
What should I do Father?

43:23.034 --> 43:31.307
Well uh, this man is he a -- a fantasy figure,
that you're having these thoughts about?

43:31.309 --> 43:38.147
Is he a model or an actor,
or... someone in your life?

43:39.117 --> 43:42.118
He's someone in my life.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.287
I see.

43:44.289 --> 43:51.728
Well then it would be prudent
to banish those temptations.

43:51.730 --> 43:56.065
Don't be around him, if you
can.

43:58.403 --> 44:02.105
I'm obliged to be around him.

44:02.107 --> 44:07.177
I see.

44:07.178 --> 44:12.248
Well, it's going to be very important
then to avoid any compromising situations.

44:12.250 --> 44:16.386
Don't be alone with him.

44:16.388 --> 44:20.223
That also, might be problematic.

44:22.861 --> 44:26.729
- There's no temptation to act on
these thoughts.

44:26.731 --> 44:33.970
I mean, it's really ridiculous,
and I would never cheat on my husband.

44:33.972 --> 44:40.109
It's just that... I can't seem
to stop the thoughts.

44:40.779 --> 44:44.681
We all struggle with forbidden
thoughts.

44:46.384 --> 44:50.820
How are things with your
husband?

44:50.822 --> 44:53.056
They're fine.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.993
No they're not. I don't know
why I said that.

44:56.995 --> 45:04.133
We haven't been good in a long time.
Rupert, he's been very busy. And...

45:04.135 --> 45:12.975
it seems, it sort of seems like
he's uninterested in me.

45:12.977 --> 45:17.180
I mean we haven't...
connected...

45:17.182 --> 45:21.918
we haven't -- we haven't felt
connected in a long time.

45:21.920 --> 45:27.990
And I just can't change it...
I...

45:27.992 --> 45:31.461
Has he said anything to you?

45:33.965 --> 45:37.917
Mary, your husband--

45:37.918 --> 45:41.870
I'm sorry I shouldn't have asked.
That's completely inappropriate.

45:41.873 --> 45:46.776
It's just that, I don't feel like
I know what's going on anymore.

45:46.778 --> 45:51.414
And what is it, that you think
I would know?

45:53.084 --> 45:54.417
I don't know.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.487
Yes you do.

45:59.858 --> 46:02.925
That he's having an affair.

46:04.262 --> 46:07.063
And why would you think that?

46:07.065 --> 46:11.834
Because I'm insecure, and
silly.

46:15.540 --> 46:19.859
No you're not.

46:19.860 --> 46:24.179
I mean -- I mean it's not silly
to be jealous about your husband.

46:24.182 --> 46:27.350
It means that you care.

46:28.286 --> 46:34.524
Thank you Father. You always know
exactly what to say to help me.

46:37.428 --> 46:41.030
Well, about these thoughts, we
should keep them in line.

46:41.032 --> 46:50.339
We should not allow them to take root.
To fester. To grow. Lest we... stumble.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.576
Okay

46:53.578 --> 46:56.078
Anything else?

46:58.416 --> 47:00.149
No.

47:02.020 --> 47:06.389
Well then let me pray for you.

47:08.827 --> 47:14.096
I recommend to your most Sacred
Heart who have now confessed to me,

47:14.098 --> 47:16.599
asking that you guard her from
relapse.

47:16.601 --> 47:27.510
After the misery of this life lead her with
me into the joys of eternal life. Amen.

47:30.048 --> 47:35.484
A Hail Mary, and a decade of
the rosary.

47:35.486 --> 47:37.887
Thank you Father.

47:54.572 --> 47:59.075
What are you doing?

48:00.111 --> 48:02.044
Good confession Father?

48:02.046 --> 48:03.279
What are you doing?

48:03.281 --> 48:06.349
- I saw her as she came in. Oh my
god!

48:06.351 --> 48:07.149
What?

48:07.151 --> 48:08.851
You dirty little rascal.

48:08.852 --> 48:10.552
- What are you blathering--
- You like her

48:10.555 --> 48:11.971
What?

48:11.972 --> 48:13.388
That woman that was just in
here.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.657
What are you talking about--

48:14.659 --> 48:17.059
You were counting down till she
got here.

48:17.061 --> 48:19.095
You're out of your mind.

48:19.096 --> 48:21.130
- You were fixing your hair.
- Would you keep it down?

48:21.132 --> 48:24.400
- You like her!
- She's a married woman.

48:24.402 --> 48:28.271
Oh my god! You like a married
woman!?

48:28.273 --> 48:29.839
Stop saying that.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.406
You have the hots for a married
woman!?

48:31.407 --> 48:32.973
You're being ridiculous, I'm a
priest.

48:32.977 --> 48:34.510
Dirty priest.

48:34.512 --> 48:37.079
You're being ridiculous.

48:37.081 --> 48:39.181
So what's it about her that does
it for you?

48:39.183 --> 48:41.234
Nothing.

48:41.235 --> 48:43.286
It looked like she had a pretty
nice bod for an old lady.

48:43.288 --> 48:45.288
Does she now?

48:45.289 --> 48:47.289
Oh, don't pretend like you
didn't notice.

48:47.290 --> 48:49.290
Commenting on the physique of one of
my parishioners is not appropriate.

48:49.294 --> 48:56.332
Yeah, well fantasying about screwing them is probably
even less appropriate, and I bet you do that.

48:56.334 --> 49:00.670
I do not.

49:00.671 --> 49:05.007
Hey, look, I get it. Like I
said sex isn't a big deal.

49:05.009 --> 49:11.047
Yeah, well it would be a big deal. It
would be a very big deal. If it were true.

49:11.049 --> 49:15.217
So you don't fantasize about
fucking her?

49:15.219 --> 49:18.521
Don't talk about her like that.

49:18.523 --> 49:23.059
-Sorry. Must be true love.

49:23.061 --> 49:26.095
Or maybe your spank bank is
just rated PG-13.

49:26.097 --> 49:36.339
You fantasize about kissing her? Holding her
hand, whispering sweet Bible verses in her ear?

49:36.341 --> 49:38.474
Absolutely not.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.109
- You know it's a sin to lie.
- I'm aware.

49:40.111 --> 49:43.212
It's like, one of the ten
commandments, I'm pretty sure.

49:43.214 --> 49:46.048
- And you're under oath.
- Not true.

49:46.050 --> 49:49.452
And the big man is listening.

49:50.421 --> 49:53.522
Telling the truth. It's like
really important.

49:53.524 --> 49:58.661
It's probably one of the most
important things. Honesty.

49:59.998 --> 50:02.064
Oh really? Okay so...

50:02.066 --> 50:05.234
truth is important to you?

50:05.236 --> 50:08.004
It's important to God, Father.

50:08.006 --> 50:11.440
Well then God must be very
disappointed in you.

50:11.442 --> 50:15.378
Just in the time you've been
here you've fabricated stories--

50:15.380 --> 50:17.146
-That was a joke--

50:17.148 --> 50:19.048
You have outright lied.

50:19.050 --> 50:19.715
-When!?

50:23.021 --> 50:26.789
Alright. Fine.

50:28.059 --> 50:29.625
You're right.

50:30.228 --> 50:34.530
So I'll tell you what -- you
can ask me any question, I swear

50:34.532 --> 50:38.768
I'll answer honestly, if you
do the same.

50:38.770 --> 50:40.536
It'll be like truth or dare.

50:40.538 --> 50:43.039
I never much cared for that
game.

50:43.041 --> 50:48.244
You know you just can't have
truth without trust.

50:49.147 --> 50:54.183
That's the only way this works.

50:55.353 --> 50:58.387
How do you know you can trust
someone?

50:59.257 --> 51:03.459
You can't know for sure. You
just have to try first.

51:03.461 --> 51:09.398
Okay. So let's try. Truth or
dare Father.

51:11.502 --> 51:16.238
Okay just truth, but I get to
go first.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.706
Fine.

51:18.543 --> 51:20.776
Why did you come to confession
tonight?

51:20.778 --> 51:24.447
Because I wasn't ready to go
home.

51:24.449 --> 51:26.299
That's it?

51:26.300 --> 51:28.150
Your question is
up. My turn.

51:28.152 --> 51:32.288
Do you like that lady that was
just in here?

51:32.290 --> 51:33.756
Yes.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.141
I knew it!

51:35.142 --> 51:36.525
I like most of the people in my
parish.

51:36.527 --> 51:41.147
No -- no do you "like" her like
her?

51:41.148 --> 51:45.768
Your time is up.
My question: Why don't you want to go home?

51:45.770 --> 51:48.582
Cause.

51:48.583 --> 51:51.395
That's not an answer. Why?

51:51.396 --> 51:54.208
Cause I don't really wanna see
my mom, or her boyfriend.

51:54.212 --> 51:56.278
So do you like her, like her?

51:56.280 --> 52:02.284
And don't act like you don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

52:02.286 --> 52:05.337
Yes. I do.

52:05.338 --> 52:08.389
But I'm not proud of that fact,
and I would never act on it.

52:08.392 --> 52:09.925
I think it's sweet.

52:09.926 --> 52:11.459
It is not sweet. It's not
appropriate.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.630
That is like your favorite word
or something.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.682
What?

52:16.683 --> 52:18.733
Appropriate. Everything is either
appropriate or not appropriate.

52:18.736 --> 52:21.437
Or appropriate this,
appropriate that.

52:21.439 --> 52:25.308
Inappropriate.

52:25.309 --> 52:29.178
You like the girl, so why can't you just like
the girl? Why do you have be ashamed about it?

52:29.180 --> 52:32.248
Because it's inappro-- it's not
right.

52:32.250 --> 52:33.916
You don't believe that.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.551
-No?

52:35.553 --> 52:38.588
No.

52:38.589 --> 52:41.624
Because if you thought it was a shit thing, you'd
call it a "shit thing." Not "inappropriate".

52:41.626 --> 52:46.395
You're right, unless of course I had a moderate
vocabulary, in which case I just might use those terms.

52:46.397 --> 52:56.172
If someone does something I think is wrong, that
pisses me off, because it's wrong -- you know?

52:56.174 --> 52:58.458
Your point being?

52:58.459 --> 53:00.743
You don't seem bothered by it,
so it can't be wrong.

53:00.745 --> 53:03.212
I see.

53:03.213 --> 53:05.680
Well, the Church has moved past
flagellation.

53:05.683 --> 53:08.450
Like farts and shit?

53:10.388 --> 53:11.654
-What?

53:11.656 --> 53:12.521
-Nothing.

53:12.523 --> 53:13.389
-What?

53:13.391 --> 53:17.326
-Nothing. Nevermind.

53:17.327 --> 53:21.262
So all I'm saying is there's no shame in
sexual desire. The heart wants what it wants.

53:21.265 --> 53:24.967
"And the heart is deceitful above
all things and beyond cure."

53:24.969 --> 53:26.602
-What the hell does that mean?

53:26.604 --> 53:28.738
It means it's my turn.

53:28.739 --> 53:30.873
Your mother's boyfriend, do you
dislike him?

53:30.875 --> 53:34.310
No it's not like that. I like
him.

53:34.312 --> 53:36.429
He's cool.

53:36.430 --> 53:38.547
So what do you fantasize about
when you think about your lady?

53:38.549 --> 53:41.517
Is this going to be your only
line of questioning?

53:41.519 --> 53:42.785
Yup.

53:44.555 --> 53:45.955
I try not to.

53:45.957 --> 53:47.890
That's not my question.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.960
But if I do dwell on such
impulses

53:50.962 --> 53:59.735
then a thought that keeps recurring deals primarily with
punching her husband in the face and running away with her.

53:59.737 --> 54:04.573
It centers on some desire to
rescue her.

54:04.575 --> 54:08.978
She's a sweet woman, and her
husband is...

54:08.980 --> 54:10.846
He's just not a very good man.

54:10.848 --> 54:14.583
Why don't you want to see your
mother?

54:16.287 --> 54:17.886
Because I hate her.

54:17.888 --> 54:21.323
What's wrong with this lady's
husband? Is he cheating on her?

54:21.325 --> 54:24.893
You are entitled to honest answers
about my life, not someone else's.

54:24.895 --> 54:26.695
Got it. He's cheating on her.

54:26.697 --> 54:27.796
I didn't say that.

54:27.798 --> 54:29.148
-Didn't have to.

54:29.149 --> 54:30.499
Why do you hate your mother?

54:30.501 --> 54:31.934
-I dunno.

54:31.936 --> 54:34.937
She doesn't even deserve it
really

54:34.939 --> 54:40.509
she's been alright, like she's
not gonna win awards or anything,

54:40.511 --> 54:42.845
but she lets me do what I want
I guess.

54:42.847 --> 54:50.819
And she's been dealt a pretty shit hand too.
So, all things considered, it's fine.

54:50.821 --> 54:55.991
It's just... when she's happy I
can't be.

54:55.993 --> 54:59.328
What do you mean by that?

55:00.031 --> 55:03.799
Does the lady know you like her?

55:03.800 --> 55:07.568
No. What did you mean by that,
if your mother is happy then you can't be?

55:07.571 --> 55:13.475
That's just the way it works
out. Does the lady like you?

55:13.477 --> 55:14.910
She might.

55:14.912 --> 55:18.047
Why are you at odds with your
mother?

55:18.049 --> 55:22.718
You think she actually likes
you?

55:24.622 --> 55:27.890
I can't discuss that.

55:27.892 --> 55:29.858
What do you mean you can't
discu--

55:31.095 --> 55:34.063
She told you in confession!?

55:34.065 --> 55:35.731
I didn't say that.

55:35.733 --> 55:36.732
Holy shit.

55:36.734 --> 55:38.967
Again, I did not say that.

55:38.969 --> 55:41.704
Why does she like you?

55:41.706 --> 55:44.473
I mean, you're a priest.

55:44.475 --> 55:45.641
I'm also a man.

55:45.643 --> 55:46.909
Yeah that can't even fuck.

55:46.911 --> 55:50.946
I can. I have the parts. I
choose to abstain.

55:50.948 --> 55:58.454
Oh. Oh okay so she wants to ride your parts because
you're hard to get. That's the attraction.

55:58.456 --> 56:02.891
I wouldn't say that,
and I certainly wouldn't use those words.

56:02.893 --> 56:08.864
There might be some forbidden
fruit kind of attraction.

56:08.866 --> 56:13.285
Also, I'm an authority figure...

56:13.286 --> 56:17.705
...of sorts. The relationship between priest
and parishioner can be somewhat intimate.

56:17.708 --> 56:22.010
Lots of people fall in love with their
psychiatrists, it's much the same.

56:22.012 --> 56:25.781
Hearing their troubles, helping
them.

56:25.783 --> 56:30.486
Yeah, makes me wet.

56:30.488 --> 56:36.959
Okay so you like her, she likes you, she's
married to a dirt bag, so what's the problem?

56:36.961 --> 56:40.529
Vows, for one. Mine to the
Church, her's to her husband.

56:40.531 --> 56:51.940
So you would rather be in this box
everyday than be out there with that girl?

56:55.146 --> 56:58.480
I'd be lying if I said I
haven't thought about it.

56:58.482 --> 57:05.821
I've thought about it.
Increasingly.

57:05.823 --> 57:08.791
It's not that simple.

57:08.793 --> 57:14.847
Yes it is.

57:14.848 --> 57:20.902
You know you're so lucky. What you want is right
there, all you have to do is reach out and grab it.

57:20.905 --> 57:23.672
Not everybody has that.

57:23.674 --> 57:26.742
- At what cost? Do you even
consider such things?

57:26.744 --> 57:31.547
Like what? Like their marriage?
He's cheating on her. It's over.

57:31.549 --> 57:35.751
Not just that. The cost to the
Church, the cost to Christ.

57:35.753 --> 57:41.790
The cost to everything I've dedicated
my life to and lived in service of.

57:41.792 --> 57:45.894
So you're saying no priest has
ever quit before?

57:45.896 --> 57:49.381
-No good priest.

57:49.382 --> 57:52.867
So what? You're not a good priest,
that doesn't make you a bad man.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.903
You can still believe in God or
whatever.

57:54.905 --> 58:00.843
It's not giving up everything.
Just this box.

58:00.845 --> 58:05.614
And maybe a few other things.

58:07.918 --> 58:11.553
You're a pretty sharp kid.

58:11.555 --> 58:16.859
You're intuitive.

58:16.860 --> 58:22.164
Yeah. Ricky -- that's my mom's boyfriend
-- he says that I'm very mature for my age.

58:24.702 --> 58:28.821
Oh, someone's coming.

58:28.822 --> 58:32.941
Ah, could you stick around for a while?
I want to talk to you some more.

58:32.943 --> 58:35.844
Oh. Really?

58:35.846 --> 58:38.497
Yeah.

58:38.498 --> 58:41.149
Okay. Glad this session was
helpful for you Father.

59:02.273 --> 59:04.172
Let me help you, here.

59:04.174 --> 59:07.676
There you go, there you go

59:07.678 --> 59:09.778
Thank you.

59:14.652 --> 59:21.189
Okay.. Just give me a minute...
to catch my breath...

59:21.592 --> 59:24.293
And this is what I mean.

59:24.295 --> 59:26.728
This is why I don't hang it all
up.

59:26.730 --> 59:34.102
Because every once in a while some lost soul
at the end of his days reflects on his life

59:34.104 --> 59:41.009
and realizes how desperately he
needs forgiveness and a Savior.

59:41.011 --> 59:51.620
And that's how I can stomach this box, because
in those moments, this is a place of redemption.

59:51.622 --> 59:56.058
And that's worth seeing.

59:56.060 --> 01:00:01.597
It makes everything else seem
silly and trite.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.233
I'm so glad you have chairs in
here.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:09.972
I don't think I could've done
those kneelers.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:13.642
I thought this was suppose to
be anonymous.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:16.912
Oh, we have another booth for
that.

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:21.183
We really should mark them
better, shouldn't we?

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.184
Yeah.

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:25.687
But it has kneelers, so...

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.657
This is a safe place.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:34.196
Do you want me to say a pray
for you?

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:35.764
No, no, no.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:39.368
Forgive me Father, uh, for I
have sinned, uh

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:46.875
It's been... thirty, thirty some
odd years since I've done this.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:48.043
Long time.

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.980
Yeah, it just never really
suited me.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.815
Things change.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:56.018
Yeah, they do.

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:58.887
The doctors they uh...

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:01.857
told me I got a month.

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:08.730
Maybe less -- in case you're wondering.
I know people usually tend to wonder.

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:15.203
So I just figured I'd get my
house in order. You know?

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:19.808
That's a very common sentiment,
I've heard it many times.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:28.050
Facing our mortality does tend to help us
understand our need to get right with the Lord.

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:32.888
Yeah, well that's what I'm doing,
just trying to cover my bases.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.607
-Your bases?

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:38.325
Yeah. Like you said, just
getting right.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:41.063
Right.

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:45.033
So... your sins are?

01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.187
Many.

01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:50.439
I guess I should just start
with my favorite.

01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:56.044
Prostitutes.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:02:01.383
I just can't get enough of
them. I mean... I just

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:06.288
I got a taste, you know what I
mean?

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.377
Drugs.

01:02:12.378 --> 01:02:14.795
Prostitutes and drugs kinda go
together. You know what I mean?

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:16.765
I've done them all.

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:21.737
Peyote, weed, mescaline, coke,
heroin, tar heroin, meth.

01:02:21.739 --> 01:02:28.009
I mean you name it, I've done it. If I ain't
done it, it probably ain't worth doing.

01:02:28.011 --> 01:02:29.010
Light adultery.

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:31.246
"Light adultery" what is that?

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:35.817
- Heavy petting. I was drunk,
she was drunk.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:41.990
Several occasions.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:48.162
Petty felonies... theft -- mostly theft. You know it's the
kind of stuff when you're exploring. Kid stuff, you know.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:52.134
Strip clubs. You guys got a
problem with that too right?

01:02:52.136 --> 01:02:55.137
That reminds me, I always
wondered about that.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:03:02.444
You know if lusting after a woman and
wanting to fuck her -- excuse me, screw her

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:09.050
Well I mean, if that's the same,
if it's going to cost against me the same

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:13.054
Then I might as well get my
dick wet right?

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.195
-Um...

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:22.531
-Street fights. Mostly.

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:27.435
With a few people that deserved
it.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:30.038
Spent a couple of nights in
jail.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:37.179
I don't suppose that's a sin,
but maybe what landed me in jail was.

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:42.251
Got to do what you got to do.

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:47.322
I read my neighbors mail. I mean I'm out
here I'm done. I think that's about it.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.392
Yeah.

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:54.162
Pretty full life huh?

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:59.835
Well.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:02.604
Oh.

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:07.726
And I lied.

01:04:07.727 --> 01:04:12.847
Oh sure everybody lies, but
some are worse than others.

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:17.285
And what was the worst one?

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:21.957
Probably about my cousin.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:27.929
And what was the lie that you
told to your cousin?

01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:30.866
Not to her.

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.903
She said I molested her.

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:41.443
I would not have said that.
I would not have called it molesting.

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:46.581
But she was a drama queen.
And she went running and told the family,

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:52.120
they confronted me and I told them she
was lying, that she was full of shit,

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:55.323
and that she was batshit crazy.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.125
And now...

01:04:57.127 --> 01:05:05.100
well I wasn't entirely,
completely truthful.

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:10.972
But they believed me, and she
was a drama queen.

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:18.513
She was always playing the victim. She
just needed to be the victim. She just...

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:24.286
Was always pulling shit like,
so they didn't believe her.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:31.159
Well, maybe some of the family
members did. But...

01:05:32.963 --> 01:05:35.430
She was always a drama queen
though.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:41.569
Killed herself like ten, twelve years ago, which
is just the kind of person she is. You know?

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:44.539
Always needed to be the center
of attention.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:49.678
Just drama, drama, drama,
drama, drama

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.980
Always drama.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:58.153
So, what can you do, right?

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.959
So do your thing.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.629
My thing?

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:12.334
Yeah, absolve me.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:17.205
There is no absolution without
contrition.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.207
- Huh?

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:25.647
You don't seem like you regret
the choices that you've made.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:32.454
Uh, well, uh, I'm just trying
to cover my bases here padre.

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.622
You know I...

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:39.377
I don't know what else to do.

01:06:39.378 --> 01:06:44.131
So you just, do whatever it is you got
to do to absolve me if there's a God.

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:47.402
If?

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:51.239
If there's a God?

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:53.174
I don't know.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:58.213
You asking me?

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:03.251
Yet you're deeply, profoundly, sorry for all
of the wrongs you have caused to this person

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:07.722
who may or may not exist?

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:10.892
Yeah. Sure.

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:14.061
Whatever, I'm just trying to make things
right between me and the man upstairs. So...

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:16.097
Let's do that.

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:20.668
I can't help you if there is no
contrition.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.070
- I'm sorry. Okay?

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:23.638
- Genuine contrition.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.809
I'm very sorry. Okay? I will do
some Hail Mary's.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:33.214
I will cross myself, I'll drink the
wine, I'll bathe in the holy water.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:34.649
Get out.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.151
What?

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:37.352
GET OUT!

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:38.552
-You've got to be kidding me.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.089
Get the hell out of my
confessional.

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:43.124
You can't do that.

01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:44.225
HEY! HEY!

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:02.377
-Not now!

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:06.848
-Gees, what's up your butt?

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:24.365
What did I say to you!

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:26.801
Excuse me?

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.638
Uh... sorry.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.707
I--

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.215
Please proceed.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:44.486
Bless me Father for I have
sinned.

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:48.590
It has been a month since my
last confession

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:53.461
- and I accuse myself of the
following sins.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.265
I've committed adultery Father.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:09:02.670
I slept with a married man.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.572
No kidding.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:07.509
I'm a home wrecker.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:11.513
- Well, you certainly seem
distraught over it.

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:13.881
I am Father, I am.

01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:18.319
- And I'd believe that, and have
hope for you,

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:26.594
if for a single minute you would
actually stop screwing Rupert Finnegan.

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:35.303
You still in there Charlotte?

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:40.675
Charlotte. I asked you a question.
Are you still in there?

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.510
Yes Father.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:46.648
-Good.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:50.785
- Now listen to me closely Charlotte, you have
been playing this little game far too long

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:53.421
-and I'm getting sick of it.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:58.359
You come here all contrite,
on your knees pleading for forgiveness

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:04.832
only to turn around, drop to your
knees and service Rupert Finnegan.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:10.905
I don't know, do you just like being
on your knees, Charlotte? Is that it?

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.241
You like being on your knees?

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:13.775
-No.

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:15.243
-What's that?

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:17.579
No.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.914
- See, now then the only alternative
is that this is a big joke to you.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:21.216
It isn't.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.785
- No?
- No.

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:26.353
You slander the sacrament, you treat
it like a get out of jail free card.

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:33.661
Shed a few crocodile tears,
make yourself feel better between trysts.

01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:40.001
- Your sins are not forgiven
Charlotte.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:44.672
- You are not absolved. You're
a bad actress.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:47.842
- Did you even considered Mary
in any of this?

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:52.880
Yes Father, that's why I'm
asking her forgiveness.

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:54.916
-Not the Holy Virgin.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.985
Finnegan. Mary Finnegan.

01:10:56.987 --> 01:11:02.174
The one you're stabbing in the
back.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:07.362
A beautiful, wonderful, lovely woman,
who has done absolutely nothing to you.

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:12.900
-You're going to hell Charlotte.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.869
Help me Father. Help me.

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.638
-You want absolution?

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.806
Yes Father.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:18.973
-Then you prove it with action.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:22.844
I'll end it. I swear I'll end
it.

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:24.545
-That's not enough.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:29.350
And what should her penance be?

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:34.822
Can I just allow myself to do
this?

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.859
Yes. I think I will.

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:41.896
This is what you're going to do.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:46.000
You're going to go to Mary.
Now.

01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:31.646
It's out of my hands now.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:58.840
What the hell has been going on
in here?

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:02.643
I'm quitting the priesthood.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:03.878
What?

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:07.115
I quit.

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.084
No shit?

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.487
No shit.

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:17.625
Okay.

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:21.996
So what now?

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:26.901
I could use a drink.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:48.423
There's nothing cheaper.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:51.459
What the hell?

01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:53.561
I'm twenty-one.

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:56.197
You got ID?

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:57.965
Fine.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:06.240
-See?

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.974
- Pretty good. Give me a couples
hours, it'll start looking real.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:11.479
- What, are you auditioning for a
job as a bouncer or something?

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:14.682
- Not a bad idea. I need the
work.

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:21.756
My old guidance counselor says you
need skills in this marketplace.

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.825
You have any skills?

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:26.060
Nope.

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.796
Well I work at SafeWay.

01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:30.965
I could put in a recommendation.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.100
You could work as bag boy.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:39.874
I don't know what I'm going to
do.

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:43.945
I guess I didn't really think
this through.

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:45.513
Think what through?

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:47.849
The cost.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.184
What about her? You're still
going to go for her, right?

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:55.556
Well you better.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:58.992
You can't chicken out now, that's what
this whole thing was about. Right?

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.864
No.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.668
Not just that. It's more than
that.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:10.705
I don't see the point of this
anymore.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:17.645
I'm not helping anybody, and
nobody wants to be helped. So..

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:22.517
Why should I sacrifice? Why
should I be alone?

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:29.624
Well... it's not all bullshit,
is it?

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.894
I mean, some people might need
confession, right?

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:35.029
Do you?

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.832
-No. But that's me.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:41.903
It's not like everyone.

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:46.674
If you don't think you're a sinner,
then you don't need a Savior,

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:51.579
and you don't need this box,
and you certainly don't need me.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:57.018
So, this isn't exactly a
celebration?

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:01.722
No. It's not.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.660
Sorry.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.231
Thanks.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:16.737
Really?

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.806
Well alright.

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:26.247
Is that how it normally tastes?

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:30.651
Yuck, no wonder people don't go
to church.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.959
So why'd you want me to stick
around?

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:39.360
Huh?

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:41.796
Well you asked me stay.

01:16:42.732 --> 01:16:43.864
Oh. Yeah.

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:45.032
-What did you want?

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:46.701
Ah...

01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:49.136
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.617
- I'm sorry Father, I didn't
see--

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.953
-No, no, no.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.623
It's fine. We were just
finishing our session.

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:10.725
Don't forget your penance.

01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:15.096
Thank you, Father... sir.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.140
- I uh...

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.343
I needed to talk to you.

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:31.178
-Of course.

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:35.116
Charlotte came to see me.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.285
Did you know?

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:42.657
Mary, the sacrament of confe--

01:17:42.659 --> 01:17:44.792
Did you know?

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:48.062
Yes.

01:17:48.064 --> 01:17:51.365
I must look like a complete
idiot to you.

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:53.167
No. Of course not.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:57.071
I'm so embarrassed. I'm so
ashamed.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:17:58.172
Don't be.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:02.109
It's not your shame. It's his.

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:09.083
Have you talked to him?

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:12.153
I called him.

01:18:13.056 --> 01:18:15.056
Screaming.

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:22.163
He denied the whole thing. He said
she was crazy, and that I was crazy.

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:25.232
He just kept lying

01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:28.436
one big lie.

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:34.175
My marriage... my marriage.

01:18:44.487 --> 01:18:49.023
What do I do Father? What do I
do?

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.464
Divorce him.

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:00.901
Divorce him?

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:03.270
Mary, you deserve someone
better than him.

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:07.208
You deserve someone who can love
you the way you should be loved.

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:12.513
Who won't hurt you. Who won't
lie to you.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:21.989
You're an amazing woman. And anyone who
doesn't see that isn't worthy of you.

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.094
What are you doing?

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:28.529
I--

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:29.963
What did you think you were
doing?

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:31.165
-Mary--

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.067
I thought -- your confession--

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:35.269
My confession?

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:39.340
Mary I -- I love you.

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:41.542
You love me?

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:42.843
-Yes.

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:48.082
I have for a while now.

01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:49.483
Mary--

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:51.435
-Please don't touch me.

01:19:51.436 --> 01:19:53.386
- I'm sorry, it shouldn't have
happened like this--

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:54.789
-I need to leave now.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.190
- No please, please, please,
just listen to me

01:19:56.192 --> 01:19:57.892
- Please just let me go
- I'm sorry.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.193
- Please just listen to me and I
can explain.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:00.795
-Please get out of the way.

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:03.931
- Let me explain.
- I just want to go.

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:07.066
Mary I'm leaving the priesthood, okay,
I am not a priest anymore? I'm quitting.

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:08.469
What?

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:09.870
We can do something. We can be
together.

01:20:09.872 --> 01:20:11.906
- Please stop. I just--
- Listen, listen

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.141
If you don't let me go, I'm
going to scream--

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.209
-I don't understand

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:16.977
you like me, I know you do.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.547
Mary, Mary, please

01:20:19.549 --> 01:20:20.815
-What the hell is going on here?

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.683
-What are you doing here?

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.284
I came to have a word with the
Father.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:27.454
He's putting ideas in people's
heads.

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:29.323
-Mary please listen to me--

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:32.860
What the hell is going on?

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.462
Mary?

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:37.932
Answer me right now.

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:40.534
-He tried to kiss me.

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:44.171
He what?

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:47.308
-He's in love with me.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.611
You tried to kiss my wife?

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:52.213
What do you care?

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:53.848
Did he tell you?

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.482
he sent Charlotte to say those
things to you?

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:58.519
He told her she'd burn in hell
if she didn't.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:02.590
He manipulated that poor woman
into lying to you.

01:21:02.592 --> 01:21:08.262
- Oh come on Rupert. How about for
just once you confess your sins?

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:14.101
Rupert! Rupert!

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:16.637
Hey!

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.476
-Rupert! Rupert!

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.412
He's lying to you Mary.

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:27.281
You're full of crap.

01:21:27.283 --> 01:21:29.950
Mary! Mary!

01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:34.889
You're through buddy, you know
that?

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:36.991
I'm gonna get your ass
defrocked.

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:39.927
Get the fuck out of here.

01:21:39.929 --> 01:21:41.295
Dick bag.

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:51.372
Get out.

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:55.309
Let me help you up.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:22:00.915
I don't want your help. Just
leave me.

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:02.216
Look I think that what--

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:03.517
-Get out!

01:22:03.986 --> 01:22:08.055
Are you deaf! Are you stupid!
Just get out!

01:22:08.057 --> 01:22:11.058
This whole night you haven't
listened to a word I've said!

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.294
You've just been sitting here,
pestering me,

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:19.667
bugging me with your goddamn stupid
made-up stories and your niggling questions

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:24.472
and your idiotic advice!

01:22:24.473 --> 01:22:29.276
And I must be a goddamn fucking idiot, to even remotely
consider listening to whatever insipid inanity

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:33.347
spewing forth from your stupid
mouth, and stupid lips!

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:38.252
You don't know anything about
anything!

01:22:38.254 --> 01:22:41.588
You're a fucking teenager, with
teenager problems.

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:47.661
You have a silly crush on your mother's boyfriend and you
think understand everything about real love and loss!

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:54.201
Yeah, that's right! I pieced that retarded puzzle
together, I'm a regular Father fucking Brown!

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:57.638
Oh Ricky, yeah he's cool. Ricky
says I'm very mature for my age.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:02.476
I can't be happy if my mom is
happy.

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:05.329
Grow up!

01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:08.181
You treat your mother like garbage because
you have a childish crush on her boy toy?

01:23:08.184 --> 01:23:10.150
You think that gives you depth?

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:15.456
You think that gives you a deep
understanding of the human condition?

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:21.195
Get out.

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:28.168
You think you know me?

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.070
You don't know shit.

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:33.640
Fine. Now get out.

01:23:36.412 --> 01:23:40.581
You're wrong about me. You were
wrong from the start.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:47.221
Fine. Whatever. Just get out
now before I throw your ass out.

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:59.400
I did kill some one.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:02.603
Yeah, that's right, the
homeless guy.

01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:04.304
No.

01:24:07.309 --> 01:24:09.276
My kid.

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:16.316
- And you're wrong about another
thing too.

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:18.519
Me and Rick.

01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:23.590
It's not a childish crush.

01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:26.293
I love him.

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:28.595
And he loves me.

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:31.532
And I slept with him.

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:35.436
Did you hear that Father?

01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:37.805
I fucked him.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.707
And not just once.

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:47.147
I slept with him... I slept
with him, many times.

01:24:48.317 --> 01:24:50.617
And then I got pregnant.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:56.623
And I wanted to keep it.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:25:01.095
I wanted to have a family. But
Ricky...

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:07.601
Ricky couldn't have that.
Couldn't let me mom find out.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:13.440
So he took me down, he helped
me fill out the paperwork.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:16.543
He even paid for it.

01:25:16.812 --> 01:25:22.549
And I didn't want him to be
unhappy. So I did it.

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:30.324
I did it.

01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:40.667
And I wish to God I could take
it back and...

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:43.237
And you know what?

01:25:43.239 --> 01:25:47.425
You know what?

01:25:47.426 --> 01:25:51.612
The bitch is, now, Ricky won't even
look at me in the fucking face.

01:25:52.882 --> 01:25:56.817
I can't even look at myself in
the face.

01:26:14.937 --> 01:26:22.643
I feel like I'm such a -- I'm
such a fuck up.

01:26:56.946 --> 01:26:58.779
I'm sorry.

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:01.281
I'm sorry. I'm sorry Father.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:03.450
-No, no

01:27:06.522 --> 01:27:09.590
Your sins are forgiven.

01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:19.700
Now go, and sin no more.

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:33.247
Good luck.

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.951
-Thanks. You too.

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:43.724
-Come by any time.

01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:07.774
Forgive me Father for I have
sinned...
