00:51.180 --> 00:52.470
Stay down.

01:05.090 --> 01:07.180
Freeze! Just freeze.

01:48.530 --> 01:50.730
Your hands ever shake, Frank?

01:51.140 --> 01:52.470
Sometimes.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.130
It's just adrenaline.

02:01.380 --> 02:02.470
Of course.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.380
How did you know?

02:04.880 --> 02:07.150
-I saw him washing the car.
-So did I.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.650
They don't wash cars
on the parking levels.

02:19.060 --> 02:20.330
Frank...

02:20.560 --> 02:22.400
...I'd like you to stay on.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.260
I'm no good in a permanent position.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.570
My feet go to sleep.

03:53.090 --> 03:55.850
You're turning down $2,000 a week?

03:58.430 --> 04:02.420
So you won't protect Rachel Marron
because she's in show business?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.160
I don't do celebrities.

04:04.770 --> 04:05.760
2500.

04:05.940 --> 04:08.170
There's many good men for that much.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.670
Have you talked to...

04:09.940 --> 04:11.930
...Racine, Fitzgerald...

04:12.510 --> 04:13.670
...Portman?

04:13.880 --> 04:15.440
Portman's interested.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.370
But we heard you were the best.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.950
There's no such thing.

04:21.450 --> 04:25.950
We're talking about a very frightened
lady with an 8-year-old son.

04:26.190 --> 04:29.020
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't think this was real.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.790
Farmer, she begged me to get you.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.130
Please.

04:36.530 --> 04:38.520
Okay, I'll come.

04:39.470 --> 04:41.630
I'll look the situation over.

04:43.540 --> 04:44.800
If I take it...

04:45.410 --> 04:47.040
...it's 3000 a week.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.910
You must be very deadly
for 3 grand a week.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.210
Watch and see.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.040
Shit.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.660
It's something.

05:05.460 --> 05:06.190
Sorry.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.230
Don't stand there, either.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.790
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.

06:07.490 --> 06:08.720
What?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.220
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.790
Got an appointment?

06:21.740 --> 06:24.570
The atomic number of zinc is thirty.

06:25.310 --> 06:26.400
All right.

07:33.380 --> 07:34.970
Can I help you?

07:37.580 --> 07:39.210
You the man on the intercom?

07:41.820 --> 07:43.220
Can I help you?

07:43.490 --> 07:45.720
My name's Edison.
I have an appointment.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.090
Arranged by...?

07:49.660 --> 07:51.060
Mr. Devaney.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.220
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.

07:56.730 --> 07:57.890
What happened?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.100
A doll.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.220
Henry Ford to see Mr. Devaney.

08:19.820 --> 08:20.650
Who?

08:20.890 --> 08:22.050
Henry Ford.

08:22.990 --> 08:23.980
Come in.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.790
Playback, everybody.

09:43.970 --> 09:46.070
That's what I want.

09:47.140 --> 09:50.310
Glad you came. Come on.
I'll introduce you to Rachel.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.570
I bet you loved it.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.080
-He doesn't know great art.
-Frank Farmer's here.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.980
-Do you think this is me?
-It's terrific.

10:00.420 --> 10:01.760
-Frank Farmer's here.
-Who?

10:01.930 --> 10:03.650
Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.160
I think Rory should be my bodyguard.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.820
Raise your butt and come meet him.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.940
All right. I'm up.

10:17.770 --> 10:19.170
Frank Farmer...

10:19.610 --> 10:20.670
...Rachel Marron.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.510
You don't look like a bodyguard.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.780
What'd you expect?

10:32.360 --> 10:34.190
Maybe a tough guy.

10:35.690 --> 10:37.180
This is my disguise.

10:39.630 --> 10:40.960
His timing's good.

10:41.530 --> 10:45.190
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
and personal secretary.

10:45.370 --> 10:46.800
Nice to meet you.

10:46.970 --> 10:47.870
Tony Scibelli.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.040
Sy Spector, publicist.

10:53.310 --> 10:54.710
Can we get you a drink?

10:55.380 --> 10:56.710
An orange juice.

10:57.380 --> 10:58.370
Straight?

11:06.720 --> 11:08.320
This is Bill's idea.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.990
A sudden obsession with protecting me.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.490
Tony's always done my security
and we've done just fine.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.150
Is this what we talked about?

11:16.330 --> 11:19.230
Bill's right. It's time
you took more precautions.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.560
I'm sure they'll say the number of
nuts writing fan letters jumps...

11:23.740 --> 11:25.730
...whenever Rachel's on a magazine.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.240
Not like this.

11:27.410 --> 11:29.000
Relax, guys.

11:29.180 --> 11:32.740
I said I'll do it, so I will.
See what I'm dealing with?

11:33.580 --> 11:36.350
I'll do this as long as
we understand each other.

11:36.690 --> 11:39.250
I won't let this thing alter my life.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.580
Honey, that won't be a problem.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.590
Rachel's household is informal.
We're all on a first-name basis.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.350
You'll fit in fine.

11:47.530 --> 11:50.520
Choose whatever alarm system
you want for the house.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.430
Improved security for the gate.
What else?

11:54.100 --> 11:55.440
What else?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.700
I think I'm safe when I'm at the house.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.440
-So the main thing is when I go out.
-Exactly.

12:01.610 --> 12:05.710
Tony will fill you in. I don't want you
falling all over me everywhere I go.

12:06.120 --> 12:10.110
Fletcher cannot be affected.

12:10.290 --> 12:13.720
I'll cover that. We'll tell him
you've got some other function.

12:13.890 --> 12:17.880
I don't want him to think he's in prison.
So the estate must not be altered.

12:18.060 --> 12:20.620
He shouldn't even know you're here.

12:22.230 --> 12:24.630
There's been a misunderstanding.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.630
So if you'll show me the way out,
I'll save us both trouble.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.770
By the pool.

12:32.140 --> 12:33.730
It was nice meeting you.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.140
Or the entry door.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.740
Shut up. Wait a minute!

12:37.910 --> 12:39.810
We shouldn't beg this guy.

12:40.420 --> 12:43.750
I'm handling this. Farmer,
would you wait a minute?

12:46.420 --> 12:50.260
I should have told you more.
I was afraid she wouldn't do it.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.920
I thought I'd let you two work it out.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.150
We did.

12:54.330 --> 12:58.320
She's not a bad person and whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.

12:59.170 --> 13:03.500
You've come this far, wait a moment.
I must show you something.

13:05.180 --> 13:06.610
Please, Farmer.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.530
How are you today?

13:34.970 --> 13:36.630
Fine. And you?

13:37.140 --> 13:39.700
Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?

13:42.380 --> 13:44.370
No, I don't like boats.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.240
Why not?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.540
I don't know.

13:48.050 --> 13:51.320
Sure you do. But you
don't want to tell me.

13:52.220 --> 13:53.810
You're a smart kid.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.050
One time I was...

13:58.660 --> 14:01.390
...stuck on a boat with
some people for 4 months.

14:01.670 --> 14:02.720
A lifeboat?

14:03.070 --> 14:04.560
No, it was a...

14:04.830 --> 14:06.670
...big, white yacht.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.900
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?

14:10.070 --> 14:11.560
What do you know about it?

14:12.010 --> 14:13.500
I've got ears.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.670
I'll remember that.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.080
This is just in the last 6 months.

14:23.850 --> 14:26.750
Have you ever had these
professionally assessed?

14:27.690 --> 14:31.020
-I heard you were in the Secret Service.
-That's right.

14:32.260 --> 14:33.590
You guard the main man?

14:34.700 --> 14:37.360
I was 2 years with
Carter, 4 with Reagan.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.030
Reagan got shot.

14:41.370 --> 14:42.860
Not on my shift.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.630
Good.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.540
This could be something.

14:49.780 --> 14:53.370
Do you think it could be the
same guy who rigged the doll?

14:53.950 --> 14:55.710
Did you tell Miss Marron?

14:58.390 --> 14:59.550
About the doll?

14:59.720 --> 15:04.130
We said there'd been an electrical
problem, like a short circuit.

15:05.730 --> 15:09.390
She doesn't need this kind of worry.
It'd really upset her.

15:10.130 --> 15:11.620
What about the police?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.790
No need. No one got hurt.

15:13.970 --> 15:15.460
The chauffeur got hurt.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.410
That was nothing.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.800
It was just our people there.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.910
I think we should show him the room.

15:40.660 --> 15:42.150
Is this her bedroom?

15:44.430 --> 15:47.490
She sleeps in the room next
to Fletcher's down the hall.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.260
Sy had this done for a magazine layout.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.170
Superstars in their boudoirs.

15:52.340 --> 15:53.430
Did you see it?

15:56.510 --> 15:58.110
We found the letter here.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.480
Someone was in here?

16:03.690 --> 16:06.780
Someone broke in and
masturbated on the bed.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.620
-And she doesn't know?
-Are you kidding?

16:12.800 --> 16:14.530
It'd really freak her out.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.130
What do you think?

16:19.370 --> 16:21.700
Someone penetrates the house...

16:21.970 --> 16:25.130
...gets upstairs, jerks off on the bed.
I'd say...

16:25.540 --> 16:27.200
...that qualifies as a problem.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.870
We don't need this.

16:29.110 --> 16:30.010
What kind?

16:30.310 --> 16:33.310
-The house is wide open.
-Excuse me?

16:33.980 --> 16:35.810
The house is wide open.

16:36.050 --> 16:39.820
You people have no clue what
security is or how to achieve it.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.320
I'll accommodate your work.

16:42.490 --> 16:43.890
I can't protect her like this.

16:44.060 --> 16:44.990
Like what?

16:46.560 --> 16:50.060
I won't be responsible for her safety
if she doesn't know what's going on.

16:50.330 --> 16:51.320
I'll make her understand.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.670
I'll talk to her.

17:04.910 --> 17:07.849
She won't give you any static.
You have my word.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.079
Sure she will.

17:10.750 --> 17:14.520
So what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard, aren't you?

17:42.550 --> 17:45.210
Guess what? It's Oscar time again.

17:45.390 --> 17:48.290
This year the money's on Rachel
Marron for best actress.

17:48.630 --> 17:51.960
And with the theme song
of " I Have Nothing"...

17:52.230 --> 17:53.790
...still big on the charts...

17:53.960 --> 17:58.800
...the versatile actress/singer
might end up having everything.

18:24.430 --> 18:25.920
Why'd you say your name was Edison?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.660
To see how difficult it was to get in.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.760
And it wasn't.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.110
-Put it on your arm.
-What's this?

18:46.620 --> 18:48.020
It'll stop the ache.

18:54.020 --> 18:58.620
I bet you can fill up a whole day
washing cars and driving Miss Marron.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.360
That's my job.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.860
We're adding to your duties.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.390
You're my new assistant.

19:08.810 --> 19:09.700
Says who?

19:11.710 --> 19:16.370
I've spent a lot of time guarding people
and I've found one thing to be true.

19:17.150 --> 19:21.480
No matter how incompetent the assassins,
or how much they miss their target...

19:22.150 --> 19:24.140
...one person always gets hit.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.540
Who?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.890
The cocky black chauffeur.

19:32.660 --> 19:34.220
Put this in the pool.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.740
This gate will be replaced next week.
I'll have 2 cameras here.

19:49.910 --> 19:52.010
A face camera by the call box...

19:52.920 --> 19:55.910
...and a scene camera on top
of this pillar, looking down.

19:56.190 --> 20:00.750
I want these trees to be cut back so
the lights can shine onto the property.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.190
And the people who come into the
property, make sure who they are.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.590
I want these all cut back, okay?

20:10.770 --> 20:14.360
She paid a lot for the estate,
she ought to be able to see it.

20:16.870 --> 20:19.430
-What're you looking at?
-Frank.

20:19.940 --> 20:24.040
This fence is going to come around
this area and end by the gate.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.040
Come on. Let's go.

20:30.890 --> 20:34.220
Not yet, not yet, not yet. Now brake!

20:38.460 --> 20:39.450
Power.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.290
Stop.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.320
Come here!

21:09.160 --> 21:10.320
Come here.

21:12.500 --> 21:16.990
That's an unusual tactic for a
guard dog. But it's effective.

21:17.670 --> 21:20.160
You can look around if you want.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.000
Sorry to disturb you.

21:22.170 --> 21:24.770
It's okay. It's an excuse to rest.

21:25.510 --> 21:28.940
This is my personal place.
I'm the only one who works out here.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.190
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.450
This is you and Rachel?

21:44.360 --> 21:47.520
When I was a kid, I put
together this little band.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.360
We played school dances
and stuff like that.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.860
Rachel joined the act
and as you can imagine...

21:55.140 --> 21:57.370
...she was quite an entertainer.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.140
Even then she could stop the show.

22:02.710 --> 22:03.800
So....

22:04.050 --> 22:05.040
I quit.

22:05.210 --> 22:06.880
Professionally, anyway.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.540
You never went back?

22:08.820 --> 22:12.050
It was pretty obvious who
the star in our family was.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.230
Lot of work went into this.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.490
Lot of work.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.720
No fingerprints, though.

22:23.330 --> 22:25.660
You think this is tied to the doll?

22:25.900 --> 22:27.560
Her manager does.

22:29.110 --> 22:32.040
" I have nothing" is natural,
given the record, the movie.

22:38.010 --> 22:40.570
I lost track of you after Washington.

22:43.350 --> 22:45.180
How's the private stuff?

22:46.020 --> 22:47.350
It's fine.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.920
Big money?

22:50.690 --> 22:52.680
It's big money, right?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.100
You wouldn't want this job.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.540
It is big money! Fuck! I knew it!
You need an assistant?

23:00.700 --> 23:04.540
I'm due to get out of here and l
have had it with assholic behavior.

23:04.710 --> 23:07.040
What a scumbag we're covering now.

23:07.210 --> 23:10.540
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.

23:10.710 --> 23:13.110
Hellfire Henry Kent.

23:13.620 --> 23:14.950
Someone wants to pop him.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.950
No surprise, with what the
shithead's been saying.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.110
Do everyone a favor.

23:20.290 --> 23:23.120
As you know, we're
non-political these days.

23:24.730 --> 23:29.130
I'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
I'll have an answer in a few days.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.290
Thanks.

23:32.070 --> 23:34.800
Why am I getting all this cooperation?

23:35.240 --> 23:36.400
Are you kidding?

23:36.570 --> 23:39.470
She's a big star.
Important people care about her.

23:40.310 --> 23:44.080
Politics and showbiz, it's
the same thing these days.

23:44.310 --> 23:45.140
Thanks.

23:51.820 --> 23:52.980
There she is.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.150
Can I have your autograph?

23:56.160 --> 23:57.420
Sure you can.

23:57.590 --> 23:59.930
We're big fans. Can we get a photo?

24:00.100 --> 24:05.000
She'll be thrilled. You're her favorite
actress. We've seen all your movies.

24:05.170 --> 24:06.500
Take a good one.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.600
Thank you so much.

24:11.770 --> 24:13.500
She'll appreciate it.

24:16.850 --> 24:19.110
I'm surprised you didn't plug them.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.360
Help me with this stuff.
You sign "much love, Rachel"...

24:40.640 --> 24:42.870
...you sign, "peace and love, Rachel."

24:43.040 --> 24:45.700
Let me set you straight on a few things.

24:48.140 --> 24:50.540
For starters, I love this lady.

24:51.710 --> 24:54.050
What I do for her, I do out of love.

24:54.550 --> 24:58.880
I'm not some hired fucking gun who's
here to make her life miserable.

24:59.220 --> 25:00.980
I do things the way she likes.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.820
Her happiness is everything to me.

25:04.890 --> 25:08.060
No problem. I'd like to
know how you handle things.

25:08.330 --> 25:10.060
I handle things fine.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.500
Watch me and learn.

25:13.000 --> 25:13.870
Turn right.

25:16.070 --> 25:17.160
Is that him?

25:17.340 --> 25:18.400
What's going on?

25:18.840 --> 25:20.170
Short cut.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.170
Want me to do a 180?

25:23.410 --> 25:24.400
Slow down.

25:35.930 --> 25:37.420
Go up to the house!

26:46.930 --> 26:49.920
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!

26:51.830 --> 26:53.430
He's through messing with my life.

26:53.600 --> 26:57.940
I'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.

26:59.510 --> 27:01.170
Farmer, come in here.

27:04.610 --> 27:07.780
-He's nuts!
-Guess who couldn't get in yesterday?

27:09.290 --> 27:10.680
Robin Leach.

27:12.290 --> 27:15.620
That's funny?! He speaks to 20 million
people and he can't get in here!

27:15.790 --> 27:16.950
He had an appointment?

27:17.130 --> 27:18.960
What about brunch at Charlie's?

27:19.130 --> 27:21.460
Rachel goes there every Sunday.

27:21.630 --> 27:24.290
She's not to do things
she's always done.

27:24.470 --> 27:27.700
" Not to do things she's always done."
He's a fanatic!

27:27.870 --> 27:29.860
So're the guys he's protecting you from.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.700
Excuse me if I don't faint.

27:31.870 --> 27:33.540
Then think about your son.

27:38.980 --> 27:40.380
What do you want?

27:40.550 --> 27:42.140
I want some peace around here!

27:42.320 --> 27:43.480
That's right.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.320
We're almost done.

27:48.220 --> 27:51.160
And I want to be able to
eat brunch with my friends.

27:51.330 --> 27:52.660
So go on Tuesdays.

27:54.060 --> 27:57.500
Tuesday morning brunch.
Where'd you get him?

28:05.010 --> 28:07.340
Louise, you have great stuff.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.170
Take it all.

28:10.010 --> 28:11.500
Try this on.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.250
Hey, Farmer...

28:14.750 --> 28:16.580
...want to come in with me?

28:16.920 --> 28:18.680
Just to be safe?

28:29.030 --> 28:30.430
You won't believe this...

28:32.370 --> 28:35.270
...but I have a reputation
for being a bitch.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.370
I didn't use to be.

28:42.610 --> 28:46.600
But you get known for being a certain
way, a way people think you are...

28:47.380 --> 28:50.220
...and pretty soon, you get like that.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.620
Guess you can't help it.

28:58.230 --> 28:59.630
You don't think so?

29:00.560 --> 29:02.720
You're an expert on famous people.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.230
I've seen a few.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.800
And you disagree?

29:07.140 --> 29:09.230
You can be as you choose to be.

29:09.570 --> 29:12.300
It's an act of discipline,
but it can be done.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.980
Is that why you never stay with your
clients? They too undisciplined for you?

29:18.580 --> 29:21.070
Or maybe you start caring about them?

29:21.320 --> 29:22.150
Right.

29:22.590 --> 29:24.490
Can't you answer straight once?

29:25.650 --> 29:28.820
You're too clever for me.
I can't keep up.

29:29.430 --> 29:30.980
Look at me, Farmer!

29:37.600 --> 29:39.430
You don't approve of me.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.660
Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford.

29:43.840 --> 29:47.430
It gets in the way? Don't like
your emotions getting to you?

29:47.610 --> 29:49.670
Never mix business with pleasure?

29:50.850 --> 29:51.940
That's right.

29:53.450 --> 29:55.610
Will you grab that red jacket?

29:57.450 --> 30:00.290
I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.690
Thanks.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.140
-Two minutes.
-Three.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.150
Wait. I want to make it really full.

31:26.210 --> 31:27.540
Put it straight up.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.530
Right there.

31:31.380 --> 31:32.870
You must hold it still.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.380
What're we looking for?

31:34.950 --> 31:36.040
Bomb.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.950
Don't worry, I already checked.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.450
Put it back here a little deeper.

31:43.630 --> 31:44.720
Hold it.

31:44.890 --> 31:48.120
Okay, now turn it. Good.
There, right there.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.890
Pull up there for a second.

31:52.070 --> 31:52.970
Son-of-a...

31:58.570 --> 32:00.130
I thought it was dinner.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.130
Are we going somewhere else?

32:03.310 --> 32:04.400
The Mayan.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.080
What's that?

32:06.250 --> 32:07.910
It's a club. Let's go.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.140
You must tell me about these things.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.750
I just did.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.150
Nice suit, Frank.

32:18.490 --> 32:20.260
I want you to keep this.

32:22.660 --> 32:24.260
It's beautiful.

32:24.770 --> 32:27.330
It's fitted with a radio transmitter.

32:27.500 --> 32:31.840
The clasp sends a signal.
If there's ever a problem, press it.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.500
I'll know you need me.

32:34.180 --> 32:35.610
She knows how it works.

32:35.780 --> 32:37.110
Let's go.

32:43.690 --> 32:45.280
Come on, let's go.

32:49.530 --> 32:50.510
Look!

32:51.960 --> 32:55.290
Look at this great show.
They don't forget.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.530
Get inside. The show's inside.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.870
Henry, just keep driving.

33:25.730 --> 33:26.820
How're you doing?

33:39.510 --> 33:42.070
He's from Paris, an amazing director.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.240
A performance artist. This is
his first video. Rachel loves it.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.250
This is Sy's idea.

33:49.420 --> 33:52.410
-I thought she'd talk to you.
-You said I had an exclusive.

33:52.590 --> 33:55.680
Maybe later. What can I say?
Laurie! How are you?

33:55.920 --> 33:58.690
You know Paul. I'll speak to you later.

33:58.860 --> 34:02.260
She doesn't do these places.
He thinks it'll help the video.

34:16.210 --> 34:18.199
He sent another one.

34:19.949 --> 34:21.940
What do you mean, another one?

34:25.790 --> 34:27.219
What do you mean?

34:27.389 --> 34:29.719
-They didn't tell you.
-Tell me what?

34:30.790 --> 34:33.889
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threat.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.889
We didn't want to worry you.

34:37.070 --> 34:39.120
And somebody got into the house.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.730
In my house?

34:40.900 --> 34:42.889
-Let's not get hysterical.
-We should go.

34:43.070 --> 34:45.630
While Fletcher was there?!

34:45.810 --> 34:47.570
The house is like Fort Knox.

34:47.739 --> 34:49.300
-Right?
-We should go.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.810
No one could...

34:51.080 --> 34:52.909
-Could what?!
-Calm down.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.480
Everyone calm down.

34:54.650 --> 34:56.310
Let's just see how she is.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.070
How are you?

35:07.260 --> 35:10.660
"Watch the door" means
no candy, no flowers.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.500
Is he out there?

35:14.940 --> 35:16.270
He's here, isn't he?

35:16.510 --> 35:17.300
Maybe.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.270
We don't know that.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.170
You know he was in my house!

35:21.340 --> 35:24.280
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.510
Fine, fine. Bill, you make it!

35:26.680 --> 35:27.670
Tell them!

35:27.850 --> 35:30.110
They'll tear the place apart!

35:37.530 --> 35:38.520
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:39.130 --> 35:41.030
...I'm sorry but...

35:41.200 --> 35:44.190
...due to circumstances
beyond our control...

35:47.870 --> 35:49.630
Wait!

35:49.810 --> 35:52.140
Don't do it. It's not worth it.

35:52.310 --> 35:55.040
No fucking freak will run me off stage.

35:57.650 --> 35:59.550
Give it up front.

36:00.150 --> 36:01.550
Let's go. We're on.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.050
We're not coming.

36:08.220 --> 36:11.320
I'm afraid Rachel will not
be able to appear tonight.

36:19.070 --> 36:21.730
Just a minute. Give me a chance.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.670
Bill Devaney, everybody!

36:32.350 --> 36:33.340
Hello!

36:36.520 --> 36:39.750
Just wanted to stop by
and maybe sing a song.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.750
I hope you don't mind.

36:44.590 --> 36:47.190
All right. Thank you so much!

36:47.360 --> 36:50.850
Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest?
Let's give him a hand.

36:51.030 --> 36:53.190
Go for it, Rachel.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.430
Want to see my new video?

37:32.140 --> 37:34.730
Are we having a communication problem?

37:35.480 --> 37:36.410
What?

37:36.580 --> 37:38.640
Are we having a communication problem?

37:40.250 --> 37:42.080
Keep this aisle clear.

37:42.250 --> 37:44.080
I know what you're saying.

37:44.250 --> 37:48.420
You've got a job to do. But you
must understand Rachel does too.

37:48.990 --> 37:50.980
And that's what she's doing.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.490
Out there.

37:52.660 --> 37:55.100
Look, she's so hot now.

37:55.260 --> 37:58.100
If she doesn't get out there...

37:58.330 --> 37:59.320
...she's dead.

37:59.940 --> 38:03.170
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...

38:03.340 --> 38:05.100
...she's dead anyway.

38:09.610 --> 38:13.780
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.

38:13.980 --> 38:14.640
No.

38:14.850 --> 38:18.950
-It could clinch the nomination.
-One word in print about this...

39:39.400 --> 39:40.730
Out of the way!

39:48.610 --> 39:49.700
I'll get it.

39:51.110 --> 39:52.270
Follow me!

39:55.450 --> 39:56.880
-Let us through!
-Fuck you!

40:01.890 --> 40:03.790
Where's the fucking limo?

40:17.140 --> 40:19.800
Henry! It's me, Sy!

40:20.810 --> 40:23.240
Stop it! Fuck!

40:28.250 --> 40:29.650
Keep driving.

40:53.510 --> 40:55.100
Never done that before.

40:57.850 --> 40:59.540
It's been a long night.

41:48.330 --> 41:51.270
Don't you want to know
why I behave that way?

41:52.600 --> 41:53.590
I know why.

43:59.890 --> 44:02.090
I don't want to talk about this again.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.060
Got you, didn't I?

44:39.670 --> 44:41.830
Bet you wonder what I'm doing.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.230
You didn't know I jog?

44:49.840 --> 44:52.780
Afraid I might get picked
off in my running suit?

44:53.080 --> 44:56.450
No. I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to jog with you.

45:00.860 --> 45:02.520
Will you walk with me?

45:07.630 --> 45:09.790
I know this is kind of late...

45:10.270 --> 45:11.700
...but thank you.

45:12.270 --> 45:14.170
I'm glad you're here.

45:14.970 --> 45:17.700
And I'm going to try to cooperate.

45:19.110 --> 45:20.630
That would be good.

45:24.810 --> 45:27.480
Farmer, I have this problem.

45:28.180 --> 45:30.480
This minor little problem.

45:30.990 --> 45:33.390
I'd like to go out for an evening.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.120
With a guy. Like a date.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.550
But...

45:40.060 --> 45:41.890
...I can't go out...

45:42.060 --> 45:45.060
...on a date because you must
be with me every minute.

45:45.400 --> 45:49.840
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?

45:52.670 --> 45:53.730
So...

45:54.740 --> 45:56.840
...the only thing I can figure...

45:57.510 --> 45:59.500
...is for you to take me out.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.020
That's what I was wondering.

46:06.020 --> 46:07.150
You know?

46:07.320 --> 46:08.690
What do you think?

46:09.220 --> 46:10.850
Only if you want to.

46:12.090 --> 46:13.690
Only if you want to.

46:16.700 --> 46:19.100
God, this is so embarrassing.

46:20.030 --> 46:21.700
You decide, okay?

46:22.770 --> 46:24.430
Sandy Harris is on the phone.

46:24.610 --> 46:28.540
Tell her I'll call her back.
I'm getting fixed up.

48:02.970 --> 48:05.700
He didn't look like he wanted to die.

48:06.710 --> 48:08.800
There's a big difference between...

48:09.040 --> 48:11.640
...wanting to die and not fearing death.

48:14.150 --> 48:17.710
And so because he had no fear
of death, he was invincible?

48:18.450 --> 48:19.820
What do you think?

48:20.890 --> 48:23.450
He sure creamed them all in the end.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.450
That was a good movie.

48:28.060 --> 48:30.290
How many times have you seen it?

48:32.570 --> 48:34.230
62 times.

48:37.010 --> 48:39.670
-I've seen it a lot.
-You can say that!

48:39.840 --> 48:41.240
I've seen it a lot.

48:59.190 --> 49:00.750
Your kind of place?

49:02.700 --> 49:04.030
Your kind of music?

49:05.100 --> 49:06.590
Absolutely.

49:08.200 --> 49:10.690
You figure no one can get by you here.

49:10.870 --> 49:15.100
If someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.

49:17.350 --> 49:19.340
What do I need you for?

49:19.780 --> 49:21.720
He might get me instead.

49:22.950 --> 49:25.110
You're ready to die for me?

49:25.790 --> 49:27.220
That's the job.

49:28.290 --> 49:29.720
And you'd do it?

49:31.890 --> 49:32.950
Why?

49:35.300 --> 49:36.730
I can't sing.

49:39.430 --> 49:43.000
Maybe there is some glory in saving a
president or somebody but...

49:43.100 --> 49:44.230
...just anybody?

49:44.640 --> 49:45.800
Like you?

49:45.970 --> 49:47.630
Yeah, like me.

49:49.140 --> 49:51.300
It's a matter of discipline.

49:52.150 --> 49:53.980
I don't trust discipline.

49:54.320 --> 49:57.150
I know at that crucial
moment I'd cop out.

49:58.090 --> 49:59.550
It happens.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.450
But not to you, fierce Frank.

50:02.820 --> 50:04.260
It happens.

50:07.830 --> 50:09.990
So have you ever liked anybody?

50:12.470 --> 50:13.460
What do you mean?

50:15.270 --> 50:17.330
Like me, a girl?

50:19.470 --> 50:21.410
Yeah, a long time ago.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.010
What happened?

50:23.340 --> 50:24.680
Do you mind if I ask?

50:24.850 --> 50:26.280
You mind if I don't answer?

50:29.350 --> 50:30.840
I don't want to pry.

50:31.020 --> 50:33.180
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

50:36.790 --> 50:37.780
What?

50:38.490 --> 50:40.690
She didn't die, did she?

50:42.600 --> 50:45.590
While you were protecting
her she got killed, right?

50:51.040 --> 50:53.370
God! That's not it, is it?

50:58.610 --> 51:00.210
That's it, isn't it?

51:02.150 --> 51:03.880
Nobody's perfect.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.390
I'm sorry, Frank.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.830
I'm sorry.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.530
Nice try, though.

51:29.010 --> 51:31.340
It was less dramatic than that.

51:32.410 --> 51:34.350
She didn't love me anymore.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.180
Can you imagine that?

51:39.920 --> 51:41.910
No, not really.

51:57.770 --> 51:58.860
So...

51:59.210 --> 52:01.770
...is this a full-service date?

52:08.050 --> 52:10.280
I'm just asking you to dance.

52:13.790 --> 52:14.950
Come on.

52:17.530 --> 52:19.290
You can dance, can't you?

52:54.500 --> 52:56.990
This is kind of a cowboy song?

53:10.110 --> 53:11.840
Nothing. It's nothing.

53:17.350 --> 53:21.340
I mean, it's so depressing.
Have you listened to the words?

53:28.960 --> 53:31.760
-It is kind of depressing.
-Yes, it is.

53:33.030 --> 53:37.300
It's one of those somebody's-
always-leaving-somebody songs.

53:48.150 --> 53:49.380
Don't worry.

53:51.220 --> 53:52.550
Don't worry.

53:52.790 --> 53:54.220
I'll protect you.

54:21.350 --> 54:23.180
It's very quiet here.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.420
You ever going to hang these up?

54:35.930 --> 54:38.020
Maybe when I'm here long enough.

54:38.430 --> 54:41.600
West Virginia University Football.

54:42.570 --> 54:43.400
God!

54:43.940 --> 54:45.530
Take a look at you.

54:46.610 --> 54:47.840
What'd you play?

54:48.110 --> 54:49.270
The end.

54:49.940 --> 54:51.430
Were you tough?

54:52.610 --> 54:54.600
No, I was fast.

55:03.690 --> 55:05.960
So you were in the Secret Service?

55:06.460 --> 55:07.760
What made you get out?

55:10.560 --> 55:11.760
Money.

55:14.140 --> 55:16.870
I can see your tastes are extravagant.

55:17.940 --> 55:18.800
May l?

55:45.070 --> 55:46.500
Be careful.

56:22.270 --> 56:24.600
You're a hard one to figure out.

56:30.610 --> 56:33.270
A bodyguard must know very little peace.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.130
Watch this.

57:42.650 --> 57:45.380
I've never felt this safe before.

57:48.490 --> 57:50.390
No one could get by you.

57:53.590 --> 57:56.150
Right now it might not be too difficult.

58:32.700 --> 58:34.220
What are you doing?

58:40.870 --> 58:44.040
I don't want to get confused
about what I'm doing here.

58:44.780 --> 58:46.610
I'm not confused.

58:47.050 --> 58:49.780
You pay me to protect you.
That's what I do.

58:53.250 --> 58:54.880
Did I do something wrong?

58:56.720 --> 58:57.710
Nothing.

58:58.990 --> 59:00.480
Then what is it?

59:03.160 --> 59:05.150
Do you want me to beg?

59:17.510 --> 59:19.450
What's going on, Frank?

59:20.650 --> 59:23.340
I want to keep straight what my job is.

59:23.520 --> 59:26.580
And what is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?

59:29.520 --> 59:31.080
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

59:31.360 --> 59:35.090
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what I did. I'm a big girl.

59:35.300 --> 59:36.820
You didn't do anything.

59:37.300 --> 59:38.660
It was me.

59:39.770 --> 59:41.460
I got involved with my client.

59:41.600 --> 59:42.660
Your client?!

59:43.100 --> 59:44.660
I made a mistake.

59:45.610 --> 59:48.300
So you're not attracted
to your client anymore?

59:48.480 --> 59:50.530
Christ, I told you why!

59:51.550 --> 59:53.600
I can't protect you like this.

59:57.320 --> 59:59.110
So that's it for me?

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.480
That's it?

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.790
I don't believe it!

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.490
Accept it, or fire me.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.390
But I can't fuck you.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.410
She's real mad at you, isn't she?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.150
She said she doesn't know why
you're being so shitty to her.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.820
I don't like you to use that language.

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:49.670
I spent a lot of time learning not to
react to things like other people.

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:51.830
That's my job.

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.600
It doesn't always work.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.540
It doesn't always work.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.170
I don't think I understand.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.620
I'm an old man compared to you
and I don't understand either.

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:08.610
I'm starting to get the feeling...

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.450
...that I never will.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.930
I thought you'd like to know.

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:23.630
Everyone said she was a sure thing.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.460
But you already knew that.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:37.210
Sorry. It's completely out of line.
It was none of my business.

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:55.070
It's off to Miami today for Best
Actress nominee Rachel Marron.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.730
She'll give two AlDS charity concerts
at the Fontainebleau Hilton.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:01.430
$1,000 a plate, no less.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:05.340
And it's a brave man who'd
deny she's worth every cent.

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:16.280
This is Mobile 1 to Station 2.
Zero 2, engineering.

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:20.320
Have them do a 14 reference to
presidential suite balcony.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:27.090
It's okay. They're cleared.

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:32.640
Mobile 2 to Catering. Security
says to clear kitchen aisle...

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:36.470
...of all obstructions and traffic,
effective immediately.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.800
Mobile 2 to front of house.

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:43.180
Security requests updated list of
all ticket holders for concert.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.120
Please fax copies of any names which are
added to the list to Security Office.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.720
What a silly job this is.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.430
Okay, we're rolling!

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.720
-Showtime, everybody!
-ls this necessary?

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.030
Yes, it is. Let's go.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.500
Quit bitching. You get paid for this.

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.510
Rachel, can you give us
a couple of minutes?

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.300
-How do you like our city?
-I love it! I love Miami!

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.860
Did you arrange all this?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.800
Hey, that's me!

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.710
Hello, Frank.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.710
It's been a long time.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.280
You working?

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.490
Not technically, but
the Governor may come...

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.290
...so I thought I'd give a light check.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.500
Someone else is covering him now.

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:31.560
How old's she?

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.130
Maybe 18.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.200
Thank you.

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:46.680
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.320
I want you all to have a good time...

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.750
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as you possibly can.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.320
Thank you.

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:00.860
I'd call that a step
up from the President.

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.860
Probably sings better too.

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:06.720
Handful.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.940
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.700
Wasn't your fault.

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:20.010
You weren't even there.

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.350
I need a drink.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.790
Orange juice.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:38.890
Who're you?

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.360
Greg Portman.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.900
I take it you've met my bodyguard.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.910
We used to work together.

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:50.740
Well, well, well.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.110
What do you do now?

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.910
Same thing as Farmer.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.980
Two samurai, huh?

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.990
So are you working now?

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.590
Not right now.

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.120
Good.

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:11.230
Because I'm the only person in
this room that needs protection.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.770
Let's get a drink. A real one.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.850
Orange juice, sir?

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:45.630
I've been watching you all
night from across the room.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.860
Why don't you go back and watch?

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.130
No, I'm not doing this.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.140
You are.

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:38.609
Please go now.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.390
Not right now.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.160
Mr. Portman was just leaving.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.920
Good night, Rachel.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.510
Shit.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.100
What are you looking at?

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.110
You probably never had a heavy night
in your whole disciplined life.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.410
Coffee?

01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:25.190
You're a self-righteous bastard.

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:29.430
Don't laugh! Don't dare judge me!

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.120
Give me a break. I didn't tell
you to fuck everyone in the hotel!

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.130
Fuck this. I don't need this shit.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.480
Industrial detergent.
It matches the traces in the glue.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.110
We'll nail this sucker.

01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:51.480
Don't take too long.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.950
It's good money, isn't it?

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.430
It's good money.

01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:31.290
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.160
-Where's Tony?
-I thought you were with her.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.540
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:48.700
The door to the suite! Where is he?

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:52.010
Get someone up here, now!

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.300
He doesn't know.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.850
Where're you going?

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.490
Where in the hell have you been?

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.100
I went to Bal Harbor to shop.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.730
You want these in the bedroom?

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:13.090
Leave them so I can look at them.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:16.400
You had us worried. You know
you're not supposed to do that.

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:19.670
I'll do what I want when I want.

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:21.870
Besides...

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.210
...I'm tired of hanging
around deadbeats.

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.110
No offense Tony.

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.220
Once more and I'm gone.

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.950
You remember something.
You work here. You work for me!

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:40.960
Where're you going?

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:43.220
To check the route, as usual.

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:47.930
Did Fletcher call?

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:13.990
Gomez!

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.270
What are you doing?

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:31.400
None of your fucking business.

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:33.440
Move!

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.950
Stick it up your ass!

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:55.770
Stop! Don't hurt my husband, mister!

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:59.430
Please, don't hurt my husband.
He not up to nothing.

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.320
I'm sorry.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.530
Hello.

01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:31.800
Mommy?

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:34.870
Fletcher, is that you?

01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:44.340
Listen.

01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:46.550
I'm through, Bill.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.710
I'm through. I'll get you
back to L.A. and that's it.

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:52.020
Fletcher's guard'll cover you.

01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.350
She got another call.

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:56.890
-I don't care.
-It was him. Same guy.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.090
I don't care!

01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:02.730
It really shook her up. She thought
it was Fletcher calling from L.A.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.670
I know she'll be reasonable now.
Come on.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.430
Save it, Devaney!

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:11.570
Those who hire me don't have to be
convinced to save their own lives!

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.510
Call me when she's ready.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.090
Nothing that's happened
between us matters.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.260
I understand now.

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.100
You must believe me because
I'm not going to beg.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.510
It wasn't what he said...

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.510
...it was the way he said it.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.970
Frank, I need you. I'm afraid.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.580
And I hate my fear.

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.660
Please protect me. Protect Fletcher.

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:35.190
If anything happened to him....

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.130
I can't.

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.460
I can't.

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:42.200
I can't protect you like this.

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.840
It's impossible.
The odds are all on his side.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:51.210
I will do whatever you say.

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:02.950
I'd want to take you away from here.

01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:05.690
I can do that.

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:14.330
It'd mean cancelling your concerts.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.400
All right.

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:22.340
No more Sy.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.180
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.810
Okay.

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:37.710
You cross me up this time, l
swear I'll kill you myself.

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:39.480
Lake's low.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.910
It'll rise when it thaws.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.690
They all in trouble?

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.070
Just one.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.770
He likes you.

01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:08.200
So is that going to protect us?

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.620
He's a trained noisemaker.

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:13.290
Come here, Foster.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.020
Just what we need.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:19.220
I don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.850
And this one does?

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:23.460
Yeah, this one does.

01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:37.140
Excuse me.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.250
Katherine had this place
organized the way she wanted it.

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.640
That's Frank's mama.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.160
Fletcher can't swim very well.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.660
He better stay in the boat then.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.680
Frank says you're a singer.

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.410
That's right.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.920
We're kind of out of things up here.
I'm sorry.

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:21.420
That's okay.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.590
You must be very successful if
you need someone like Frank.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:31.690
It's quiet here.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.930
Frank spent 6 months here
after that Reagan thing.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.300
Reagan thing?

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.880
Frank was gone when Reagan was shot.
He never got over it.

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:51.550
That's the day we buried Katherine.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.310
He's a rascal now.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.450
Tell us.

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:00.550
I never hit him.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.130
-Ever.
-You should have.

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.630
That's unusual for my people.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:07.830
So what happens is, he's
about 10 years old...

01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:10.460
...and he starts complaining to me.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.900
How about that.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:15.470
Dad, I'll tell them about the
time you stripped in court.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.580
I want to hear this.

01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:20.900
I'm proud of that!

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.910
So, anyway, he starts
playing tackle football...

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:29.850
...when he's 10 and one day he comes to
me and says he's afraid of being hit.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.350
Says it's my fault. "How come
you never hit me?" he says to me.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.160
How about that? He got over it.

01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:40.600
Turned into one hell of a wide receiver.

01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:45.260
He was always like that, my son.
Couldn't stand being afraid.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.100
Something scared him, he'd just keep
doing it until the fear went away.

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:53.950
His mama was the same way.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.950
You have a beautiful family.

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.950
-You had enough to eat?
-Fletcher, wipe your mouth.

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.950
-Save some for dessert.
-You through, bucket mouth?

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.460
I won't tell about when you
were 13 and discovered girls.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.290
Come on.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:15.630
You can run but you can't hide.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.540
I'm black, right?

01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.200
You know you're white. Your move!

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:27.400
My move? You're sure?

01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:30.210
The last move, I took your rook.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.720
That's right.

01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:46.060
How long has this been going on?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:49.990
3 years.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.930
First year he had me on the run.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:59.840
What do you think?

01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:02.750
Knight to king-four.

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:04.840
City kid.

01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:24.600
Son, you come here and sit with me.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.770
Well, that's it for me, guys.
I'm going to bed.

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:34.880
You're in trouble.

01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:49.490
Foster, right here. Turn around.

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:07.580
Good night, Rachel.

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:10.410
Good night, Frank.

01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:13.140
Good night, Foster. Good night.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.420
It's good to hear you laugh.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.820
Stay.

01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:47.350
You're very thorough.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.460
What's happening with you and Rachel?

01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:02.970
One minute she has magnetic
hands and the next she hates you.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.470
I don't know what's going on now.

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:08.140
You follow all her moves this closely?

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.570
It's a living.

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:14.980
No, it's not.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.820
You must think my life's pretty sick.

01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:29.230
You must. I do.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.730
Then why don't you change it?

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.230
Is it that easy?

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.180
You're a lovely woman.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.620
But you don't want me?

01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:04.260
I'm surprised. Thorough fellow like you.

01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.130
Why stop at one sister when
you can fuck them both?

01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.130
I make my mistakes.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.770
But you didn't say no to the boss.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.290
Is this elk?

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.660
- A dear?
- Yes

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.730
Big.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.300
First time I've heard church
music in the middle of the week.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.420
Jesus loves me, oh, yes, he does.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:15.430
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:25.210
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.610
For the Bible...

01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:35.850
...tells me so.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.450
-Hi, kiddo.
-Hi, honey.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.580
Where's Fletcher?

01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:33.880
Help!

01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.240
He can't swim!

01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:46.620
Help!

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:49.230
Help!

01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:52.160
Let me have him!

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.640
What were you doing?

01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:08.410
You're crazy!

01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:09.710
You are out of your mind!

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.720
You could have drowned him!
You could have drowned him!

01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:15.420
I'm sorry.

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.360
I got careless.

01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:23.720
How will we get the boat back?

01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:35.560
Put them in there.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:49.750
Someone's cut the phone lines. Could
be anywhere between here and town.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.750
Both cars are dead. I don't see how.

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.590
Who knows you're here?

01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:59.890
I don't know. This place
has nothing to do with her.

01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:02.590
Maybe it has to do with you.

01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:07.230
And we can't walk out of here at night.

01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:08.470
I know.

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.870
We'll stay and walk out at first light.

01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:32.550
I was an idiot last night.

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.560
What'd you think about today?

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:50.000
I think this is no maniac.

01:31:51.810 --> 01:31:53.340
He knows what he's doing.

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.880
You're right. He does.

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:02.020
Tell me about it.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.590
-Who is it?
-He almost got Fletcher...

01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:07.090
How do we stop him?

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:09.820
-He almost got the baby!
-Who is it?

01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:11.520
I don't know.

01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:12.830
Call it off.

01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:15.830
He doesn't even know who hired him.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.530
I don't know who he is and
he doesn't know who I am.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.200
How did you do it?

01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:25.270
How?

01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:27.740
I went to a bar in East L.A.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.680
I asked around. And there was this guy.

01:32:32.850 --> 01:32:33.840
Name?

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.850
-Armando.
-Give me his name!

01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:37.920
Armando.

01:32:43.130 --> 01:32:45.560
He arranged it, that's all I know.

01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:47.860
It's all paid?

01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:52.870
Is it paid for?

01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:55.940
And then some, okay? Till it's done.

01:32:58.310 --> 01:33:00.640
He keeps going until he kills her?

01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:07.880
-What's the name of the bar?
-I'm not sure.

01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:09.250
I was stoned.

01:33:12.330 --> 01:33:15.260
All right. How about the letters?

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.600
The letters came first. I don't
know who's writing the letters.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:22.500
Shit, but they're reading my mind.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.970
Those are my thoughts. I hate her.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.970
It made me think I could do it.

01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:37.110
But I would never hurt the baby.
I would never hurt Fletcher!

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.270
I know.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:42.450
You must stop it.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.610
We will.

01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:45.460
You and me.

01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:56.460
Don't you want to know why?

01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.470
You told me.

01:33:58.570 --> 01:33:59.800
She has everything.

01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:07.700
What if we can't find him?

01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:15.950
Stay here and don't move.

01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:34.030
-It's me!
-God!

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.170
What's happening?

01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:37.800
Stay with her!

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.410
-Where's Nicki?
-No! No, stop! I'm the one--

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.830
-Dad?
-We're okay.

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:20.680
-Doesn't make sense.
-What do you mean?

01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:21.910
We got him.

01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:24.140
What do you mean? Where?

01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:27.840
Here. Last night. In L.A.
You should see this guy's locker.

01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:29.680
He's obsessed with her.

01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.150
You sure it's him?

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.690
Forensics say a 100% positive lD.

01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:36.290
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:37.990
We know you did it.

01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:40.100
Ray's with him now.

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:45.700
It's you that sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.

01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:46.930
We know!

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.170
We know it!

01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:54.010
Whoever you got down there wasn't here
last night. This was a professional.

01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:55.940
This is crazy.

01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.710
What do you want to do?

01:36:59.890 --> 01:37:01.110
How long can you keep him?

01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.190
All he's done is write some letters.

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.320
48 hours maximum. You know the deal.

01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:10.320
I know.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:21.060
Strict security surrounded the funeral
of music executive Nicki Marron...

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.870
...who was shot at a lakeside
retreat by an unknown intruder.

01:37:26.010 --> 01:37:29.000
Nicki was the eldest
sister of Rachel Marron.

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:33.550
A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated
actress said she was devastated...

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.020
...and added that naturally it cast a
pall over the upcoming award ceremony.

01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:54.790
You okay?

01:38:56.470 --> 01:39:00.100
Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.
How about yourself?

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.710
I couldn't sleep.

01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:08.650
It was so scary, just thinking about it.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.710
Are you scared?

01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:15.580
Everybody's afraid of something.

01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.490
That's how we know we
care about things...

01:39:21.490 --> 01:39:23.120
...when we're scared to lose them.

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.670
What are you afraid of?

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.140
I think you should try
to go back to sleep.

01:39:35.210 --> 01:39:37.680
Is it the man who killed Nicki?

01:39:39.850 --> 01:39:41.750
Are you afraid of him?

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.220
Then what?

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:49.620
What are you afraid of?

01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:58.220
I'm afraid of not...

01:39:59.870 --> 01:40:01.160
...being there.

01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:10.700
It's late. Want me to
take you up to your room?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.470
May I sit down?

01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:22.840
It isn't over yet, is it?

01:41:26.490 --> 01:41:28.010
So he'll come again?

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.720
It's possible.

01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:33.150
At the Oscars?

01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:36.190
Maybe.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.500
Back in Squirrel Hill...

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.640
...I started betting my friends 50 bucks
each that someday I'd win an Oscar.

01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:54.340
So it's very important for them
to see me up there if I win.

01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:00.280
If every one of those pikers comes
through, it'd add up to a lot of money.

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.890
I don't know, Rachel.

01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:10.220
I think it's still dangerous.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:13.890
I didn't get here by doing
the smart thing every time.

01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:18.830
How about you?

01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.670
Out there on the edge.

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.180
Haven't you done something
that didn't make sense...

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.910
...except inside you? In your stomach?

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.390
I know you have.

01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:40.490
Because no one gets good without it.

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:42.690
And I know you're good.

01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:49.560
Look...

01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:53.100
...I don't know why this is happening...

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.410
...but I know it's not your fault.

01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.940
And I hope you can hear me because
this is the way I say I'm sorry.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.880
So...

01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:08.510
...I'm going to the
Oscars and see if I win.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:12.510
And I won't worry about
it at all, because...

01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:15.280
...I have you to protect me.

01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:18.530
That's right.

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.730
That's right.

01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:12.410
We'll go straight back to the Green Room.
Got that, Tony?

01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:14.280
Tony knows what he's doing.

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:19.290
I wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.

01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:20.880
Right?

01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:23.590
Unless I lose the award.

01:44:26.970 --> 01:44:28.370
Jesus, what a crew!

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.200
Screw it.

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.370
I'm tired of worrying.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.300
When your time is up...

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:39.500
...it's up.

01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:41.980
Right, Frank?

01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:08.470
-Rachel Marron, how are you?
-Fine. And you?

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.010
Good. You look lovely.

01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.240
-Thank you.
-And they love you, don't they?

01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:13.640
They're going wild!

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:16.340
So are you the queen of this night?

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.710
Let's hope so.

01:45:18.650 --> 01:45:22.640
Good luck. Everybody's pulling for you.
Rachel Marron, everybody.

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:32.660
And the award for best
achievement in sound...

01:45:33.370 --> 01:45:34.860
...goes to...

01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:36.660
...Kay Colvin...

01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:39.860
...and Mychal Smith for "Hot and Cold."

01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:02.990
Thank you so much.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.590
I want to thank our producers.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:12.300
There is a gap, house left, rows EE FF.
Get me some fillers.

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:18.470
You look beautiful. I just need to
tell you your responsibilities.

01:46:20.610 --> 01:46:23.310
Now it's Best Sound.
Then a song, then you.

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.780
At 8:07, you will be
presenting with Clive Healy.

01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:28.920
Your lines.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.490
The TelePrompTer is straight ahead
and, we pray, working perfectly.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.930
I understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.

01:46:39.170 --> 01:46:43.330
That's right and I don't like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.730
I wish.

01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:47.740
How's the Hollywood cricket scene?

01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:52.810
Coming out of commercial. Five,
four, three, two. Cue music.

01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:55.580
Cue Robert.

01:46:58.450 --> 01:47:00.510
Welcome back to the Academy Awards.

01:47:00.650 --> 01:47:02.120
Stand by, dancers.

01:47:02.290 --> 01:47:05.660
I just heard that in New York
the economy is so bad...

01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:08.950
...that the Mafia has
laid off five judges.

01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:14.960
I'm going to look around,
then come back for her.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.300
No more carrots.

01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:21.070
Did you like the couple that just won?

01:47:21.210 --> 01:47:24.140
Did you ever see a woman on
sound that looked like that?

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:26.600
She must have been the boom girl.

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:30.140
Looked like the bada-bing-bada-boom
girl right there.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.680
If she's working sound, who's listening?

01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:34.210
Lighting change.

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:37.980
And he was eloquent: "It's the
most happiest day of my life."

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.790
Bet his mother was very
most proudest of him then.

01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:43.150
20 seconds.

01:47:46.630 --> 01:47:48.330
Hi, Frank. How are you?

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:49.790
Why're you here?

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.340
-On the job.
-Who?

01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:55.160
Him.

01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:57.240
Short-term gig, but...

01:47:58.110 --> 01:47:59.340
...profitable.

01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:04.720
Frank, I'm sorry about Miami.

01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:08.650
Cue music.

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.550
Cue dancers.

01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:21.130
Back to work.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.690
See you at the Governor's ball.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.870
She sounds great.

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.610
I want her run out of town.

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.080
She must go!

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.420
Tony, you there?

01:48:46.130 --> 01:48:47.180
Tony?

01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:52.590
I have a feeling this is the night.
He'll go for her on camera.

01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:54.030
That's crazy!

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.140
That's how he wants it to look;
but he's not crazy, he's very clever.

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.860
Listen, I need you to help me tonight.

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:04.440
You can't use that thing.
There's bad breakthrough.

01:49:04.610 --> 01:49:06.310
I must disconnect you.

01:49:07.450 --> 01:49:08.440
I'll do it.

01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:12.510
You get it back after the show.

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:25.650
What's wrong?

01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:27.130
Ready to go?

01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:29.460
Shall we go?

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.530
Gentlemen, is this necessary?
Must we have everyone?

01:49:32.710 --> 01:49:35.170
We have our own man at the door!

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.700
Please.

01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:39.400
No, I want him.

01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:43.470
Fine.

01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:47.480
Stay alert.

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:51.650
Let us brighten this firmament.

01:50:08.670 --> 01:50:12.440
Coming through, please.
How much time do we have?

01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:14.500
Resetting staircases.

01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:17.380
Scenery coming in.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.110
30 seconds to lighting change.

01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:27.760
30 seconds. Don't panic.
Clear this area, please.

01:50:33.130 --> 01:50:35.760
Rachel, up, to the right and through.

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:41.130
Clive, up, to the left and through.
You'll meet on the landing.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.030
Watch your step going down.
Somebody spilled water.

01:50:49.050 --> 01:50:50.140
Shall we?

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:01.890
Do try to relax. I know
you must be very excited.

01:51:02.490 --> 01:51:03.620
Thank you.

01:51:08.430 --> 01:51:10.730
Presenting the Best Song award are...

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:12.560
...Hollywood's newest couple.

01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:15.000
He's England's knight in shining armor.

01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:18.000
She's America's queen of the night.

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:21.700
Please welcome Clive
Healy and Rachel Marron.

01:51:49.810 --> 01:51:51.170
Well, Rachel....

01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:55.800
I know you only came to present this
award and you'll leave when we're done.

01:52:05.190 --> 01:52:09.090
No, I'm very interested in
one of the awards tonight.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.550
Best Actor.

01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:17.600
Tonight we heard 5 songs and
the names of their creators.

01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:28.950
No matter what anyone thinks.
I know you have no personal favorites.

01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:32.480
The Best Song nominees are...

01:52:32.690 --> 01:52:37.380

01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:02.410

01:53:07.650 --> 01:53:10.590
All right, Clive, let's find out...

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.890
...who the winner is.

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.990
The envelope. Rachel,
shall I do the honors?

01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:30.210
And the winner is:
" I Have Nothing"...

01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:33.370
...from "Queen of the Night"

01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:41.680
She's good, Frank.

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:46.620
I'm okay.

01:53:47.290 --> 01:53:48.780
I always said she was nuts.

01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:50.850
I'm okay, all right?

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:54.300
You're making me
into a raving lunatic!

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:56.890
God!

01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:59.290
You okay?

01:53:59.470 --> 01:54:00.700
Yes!

01:54:01.710 --> 01:54:03.200
Fucking actresses!

01:54:04.710 --> 01:54:06.470
-Where's Portman?
-Who?

01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:08.580
-Portman.
-Never heard of him.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.650
I'm sorry, but if you want to be in your
seat for Best Actress, you must go now.

01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:23.790
I'm going as fast as I can. Why don't
you go twitch somewhere else?

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:26.430
Everything's fine. No one noticed.

01:54:26.730 --> 01:54:30.130
-Everyone's jumping out of their skins.
-Bullshit.

01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:32.670
Farmer's making me into a lunatic!

01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:35.140
-You should know--
-You're driving her crazy!

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:37.070
I know who it is.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.140
-Shut up!
-He's here tonight!

01:54:39.610 --> 01:54:43.980
You're a maniac! You've embarrassed
me in front of billions of people.

01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:49.080
-Wait for Frank. Honey, please.
-Three minutes!

01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:50.810
Calm the fuck down!

01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:52.510
Is he coming?

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.360
I know who it is.

01:54:59.530 --> 01:55:00.520
Portman.

01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.170
Remember? The guy in Miami.

01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.690
-Oh, yeah, the pencil neck!
-ls anyone coming with me?

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:10.840
After tonight, you're in charge.
He knows nothing about show business.

01:55:11.010 --> 01:55:13.000
Two minutes to Best Actress.

01:55:14.710 --> 01:55:16.540
You're an asshole.

01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:20.280
To present the Best Actress award...

01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:25.650
...we have the man who last year, won
for his performance in "South of Waco"...

01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:28.780
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Mr. Tom Winston.

01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.500
Thank you, Academy.

01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:43.670
Did you see him?

01:55:44.410 --> 01:55:47.740
-Go to the other side of the stage.
-What do I do?

01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.040
See those people?

01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.980
They don't need to be there.

01:55:52.150 --> 01:55:54.140
That guy with the camera too.

01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:56.520
I'll take care of it.

01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:02.160
Rachel Marron for "Queen of the Night."

01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:16.330
You!

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:21.340
Rachel Marron!

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:23.610
"Queen of the Night."

01:57:40.690 --> 01:57:42.160
Go to commercial.

01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:43.920
He's got a gun!

01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:45.130
He's got a gun!

01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:48.260
Get the gun!

01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:16.190
-She's bleeding!
-It's not me!

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:19.820
He's my bodyguard!

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.570
Frank! Stay with me!

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:35.470
Stay with me! Come on.

01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:38.480
God, hurry up!

01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:56.350
How's it going?

01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.730
It's under control.

01:59:59.730 --> 02:00:01.720
It won't be the same without you.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.830
How you doing?

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.980
You shouldn't be here.

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:25.150
So you're quitting show business?

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.850
Too bad. You had talent.

02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:35.560
Fletcher, go to the plane.

02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:40.940
How's the new guy?

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.110
He's got white hair.

02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:50.410
-He's very good.
-But did you have to get me an old man?

02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:53.150
I don't trust you.

02:01:07.130 --> 02:01:10.300
Let's get this over with,
okay? Give me a kiss.

02:01:17.210 --> 02:01:18.510
Goodbye, Rachel.

02:01:20.210 --> 02:01:21.800
'Bye, Frank.

02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:33.050
If I should stay

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:40.530
I would only...

02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:42.690
...be in...

02:01:44.170 --> 02:01:45.690
...your way

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.470
So I'll go.

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:52.010
You okay?

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:54.640
But I know...

02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:58.540
...I'll think of you.

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.550
Every step of...

02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:03.850
...the way

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:11.480
Wait!

02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:23.370
And I will always love you

02:02:40.690 --> 02:02:42.680
You, my darling you

02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:49.290
Bittersweet...

02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:52.760
...memories

02:02:54.910 --> 02:02:56.900
That is all...

02:02:57.140 --> 02:02:59.770
...I'm taking with me

02:03:02.010 --> 02:03:03.780
So goodbye.

02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:07.620
Please don't cry.

02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:10.920
We both know...

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:14.090
...I'm not what you need

02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:24.930
And I will always love you

02:03:36.450 --> 02:03:40.350
Our speaker this evening has
been a lone courageous voice.

02:03:40.650 --> 02:03:45.110
He alone has challenged those
who have linked organized crime...

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:48.520
...with legitimate business
throughout our state.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.660
Welcome, Congressman.

02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:02.610
First our benediction will be delivered
by the Reverend Phillip Hardy...

02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:06.540
...of the First Presbyterian
Church of lowa Rapids.

02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:12.610
Heavenly Father...

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:16.780
...please bless us today as we
meet in friendship and duty.

02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:21.490
And, Lord, whatever dangerous
endeavors those among us may take...

02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:24.560
...Iet them never be
without Your sanctuary.

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.220
We know in our hearts...

02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.800
...that though we may pass through
the valley of the shadow of death...

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.700
...You are with us...

02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.500
...guiding and protecting us.

02:04:36.570 --> 02:04:37.800
Amen.
