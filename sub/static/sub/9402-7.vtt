00:00.498 --> 00:01.927
Previously on One Tree Hill...

00:02.522 --> 00:04.072
Trick or treat!

00:04.140 --> 00:05.407
Can I help you?

00:05.474 --> 00:07.659
Is my son here?

00:07.727 --> 00:10.195
Oh, please, God, no.

00:10.279 --> 00:11.813
Hey.

00:11.864 --> 00:15.283
I just wanted to say that I'm
really sorry Alex left town.

00:15.334 --> 00:17.919
Look, we both know you wanted her gone.

00:17.987 --> 00:19.254
And now she's gone.

00:19.321 --> 00:23.075
Just do me a favor... don't
pretend you care, okay?

00:23.142 --> 00:25.293
I was thinking about what you said...

00:25.344 --> 00:28.547
about that quarterback, Troy Jameson.

00:28.631 --> 00:30.165
Yeah? You gonna talk to him?

00:30.216 --> 00:31.933
No. But you are.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.501
I can't do that. I'm not an agent.

00:33.553 --> 00:35.470
Look, if you want to help
me out with the agency,

00:35.521 --> 00:36.855
this is where you can start.

00:38.674 --> 00:41.610
So the reason that I
came a few weeks early

00:41.677 --> 00:43.645
is that I want to help with the wedding.

00:43.696 --> 00:45.346
Financially.

00:45.398 --> 00:47.282
Mom, what are you talking about?

00:47.349 --> 00:48.516
I'm gonna pay for everything.

00:48.568 --> 00:50.452
I'm gonna make this

00:50.519 --> 00:53.455
the wedding that you
both always dreamed of.

00:56.459 --> 00:57.793
Crisis intervention.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.244
Hi. Haley?

00:59.328 --> 01:01.396
Hi. You haven't called in a while.

01:01.464 --> 01:03.364
I wanted to call, but...

01:03.416 --> 01:05.967
I figured I shouldn't
be wasting all your time.

01:06.035 --> 01:07.886
I'm not the only person with problems.

01:07.970 --> 01:11.256
Trust me. You're not
wasting a second of my time.

01:11.340 --> 01:12.607
Slainte, Haley.

01:12.675 --> 01:14.643
Sorry?

01:14.710 --> 01:16.728
It means "cheers."

01:16.813 --> 01:18.847
Slainte, Erin.

01:18.898 --> 01:21.516
Hey. You were great...
I mean really great.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.018
Thanks very much.

01:23.069 --> 01:24.269
Slainte.

01:26.522 --> 01:28.073
Cheers.

01:33.946 --> 01:35.247
I can't...

01:36.899 --> 01:39.451
Ooh!

01:39.535 --> 01:41.286
Dude.

01:49.295 --> 01:51.296
I wonder if they'd all be smiling

01:51.380 --> 01:54.049
if they knew you were
filming them from the bushes.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.433
I was just thinking about the wedding,

01:55.518 --> 01:57.686
and I realized I don't have a best man.

01:57.753 --> 01:59.471
Since I moved to Tree Hill,

01:59.589 --> 02:01.439
I've lived in this Brooke bubble,

02:01.524 --> 02:03.608
and I haven't gotten close to anyone else.

02:07.947 --> 02:09.531
- Brooke?
- Sorry.

02:09.598 --> 02:13.368
I was just trying to
envision a Brooke bubble.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.120
Who was your best friend growing up?

02:15.204 --> 02:16.321
Um...

02:16.405 --> 02:18.439
I was!

02:18.491 --> 02:20.542
Isn't that right?

02:20.609 --> 02:22.944
Ju-ju bee?

02:22.995 --> 02:24.612
10-4, big mama.

02:26.048 --> 02:28.783
Okay, maybe it wouldn't hurt

02:28.834 --> 02:30.552
for you to have some male friends here.

02:30.619 --> 02:32.220
Why don't you bond with the guys today

02:32.288 --> 02:33.972
while I take your mom to the bridal expo?

02:34.056 --> 02:35.957
I can't go?

02:37.426 --> 02:38.927
Not that I want to. It's just...

02:38.978 --> 02:40.595
Are you sure you're gonna be okay

02:40.646 --> 02:43.348
spending the whole day
alone with my mom today?

02:43.432 --> 02:46.101
Yeah. It beats spending the
day with my mom in prison.

02:46.152 --> 02:50.138
Besides, she's almost as excited
about our wedding as I am.

02:50.189 --> 02:51.239
- Ready?
- Mm.

02:51.307 --> 02:52.274
Okay.

02:52.325 --> 02:54.492
Over and out, mama's boy.

02:56.362 --> 02:57.812
You look pretty.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074

03:09.542 --> 03:11.793
I thought you two could
use a coffee break.

03:11.844 --> 03:13.011
Hey!

03:13.095 --> 03:14.713
Thanks, Chase.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.551
Oh. I heard pregnant
ladies can't drink coffee.

03:19.635 --> 03:22.337
Oh. Yeah. We can't.

03:22.388 --> 03:23.805
Juice would've been fine...

03:23.856 --> 03:25.807
that was really nice of
you... glass of water.

03:25.858 --> 03:28.343
No problem. Let me know
if you need anything else.

03:30.012 --> 03:31.396
Chase, out.

03:33.015 --> 03:34.482
Sorry.

03:34.533 --> 03:36.201
See you, buddy.

03:36.285 --> 03:39.154
So, things seem to be going
really well with you guys.

03:39.205 --> 03:41.456
Yeah, now that Alex is out of the way,

03:41.523 --> 03:43.408
I can finally talk to him again.

03:43.492 --> 03:45.193
Yeah.

03:45.244 --> 03:47.362
Oh, look... "knuckle-puss."

03:49.298 --> 03:51.249
Let's put that in the pre-hate file.

03:51.334 --> 03:53.385
We're never gonna find another artist.

03:53.469 --> 03:55.203
Yes, we will.

03:56.505 --> 03:58.039
Okay.

03:58.090 --> 04:01.009
What about the girl from open-Mike night?

04:01.060 --> 04:03.411
She was awesome. Why? Do you know her?

04:04.764 --> 04:06.398
Sort of. Her name's Erin.

04:06.482 --> 04:08.183
Great. So get her in here.

04:08.234 --> 04:10.551
I would love to, but the
only reason I know her

04:10.603 --> 04:13.571
is that she's been calling
into the crisis center hotline.

04:13.656 --> 04:15.407
It's supposed to be anonymous.

04:15.491 --> 04:16.940
But you know as well as I do

04:17.026 --> 04:19.160
that artists love to
hear how great they are.

04:19.228 --> 04:22.079
Yeah. That's true.

04:22.164 --> 04:23.782
- I think you're great.
- You're so awesome.

04:53.979 --> 04:56.281
Quinn's out of town,
man. What'd you expect?

04:56.365 --> 04:58.116
Literally, anything else.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.951
Yeah.

05:00.036 --> 05:02.120
Hey, I got an interesting
phone call this morning.

05:02.204 --> 05:03.955
Yeah. Sorry about that.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.608
Jamie's been calling everybody
about this frog he found.

05:06.676 --> 05:08.276
No, I...

05:08.327 --> 05:11.212
Jamie found a frog? That's awesome.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.964
No, but, uh...

05:13.049 --> 05:15.917
I just heard that Troy
Jameson fired his agents.

05:15.968 --> 05:18.920
So if we want to sign
him, we got to act fast.

05:18.971 --> 05:20.822
Great. What can I do to help?

05:20.890 --> 05:22.107
I need you to fly to Atlanta

05:22.174 --> 05:23.758
and talk to the falcons' management.

05:23.809 --> 05:25.210
I was thinking more along the lines

05:25.277 --> 05:26.627
of getting you something for lunch.

05:26.679 --> 05:28.646
There's no way I'm ready
for something like that.

05:28.731 --> 05:30.398
Nate, all you got to do is go there

05:30.466 --> 05:32.633
and find out what's
holding up Troy's contract.

05:32.685 --> 05:35.270
You'll be back in time for dinner.

05:35.321 --> 05:37.155
I mean, look, I would do it myself,

05:37.239 --> 05:39.441
but I'm under strict
doctor's orders not to fly.

05:39.492 --> 05:40.975
Yeah. You feeling any better?

05:41.026 --> 05:42.911
Yeah, you know, a little.

05:42.978 --> 05:45.530
You know, but it's still
hard to move my right arm.

05:45.614 --> 05:47.999
So, that and the fact
that Quinn's out of town

05:48.084 --> 05:49.701
is really killing my sex life.

05:49.785 --> 05:53.121
Well, that's why I learned
how to dribble with both hands.

06:07.837 --> 06:11.439
Oh, quiet, Mouth. Lucas had a rough night.

06:14.310 --> 06:15.676
Alex, what are you doing here?

06:15.728 --> 06:17.312
I had a few days off, and
I wanted to come visit.

06:17.363 --> 06:18.480
What are you up to today?

06:18.531 --> 06:20.181
I was just gonna hang with the guys today.

06:20.232 --> 06:22.567
Yeah, right. In your dreams, buddy.

06:22.651 --> 06:24.352
W...

06:28.007 --> 06:31.192
Yes, it was all just a dream.

06:31.243 --> 06:35.246
Mm-hmm. That's why the top kept spinning.

06:35.331 --> 06:38.032
Yes, it was a little long.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.001
Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.

06:40.052 --> 06:41.219
Crisis intervention.

06:41.303 --> 06:42.587
Haley?

06:42.671 --> 06:45.557
Erin?

06:45.641 --> 06:48.560
Hi. I'm so glad you called.

06:48.644 --> 06:51.045
How... how have you been?

06:51.096 --> 06:54.315
Uh, have you had any
luck finding inspiration?

06:54.383 --> 06:55.817
Actually, yeah.

06:55.884 --> 06:57.485
I, uh...

06:57.553 --> 07:00.855
I got up and I sang at an
open mike the other night.

07:00.906 --> 07:02.574
It felt great.

07:04.410 --> 07:06.727
Good. Um...

07:06.779 --> 07:08.713
Can I tell you something?

07:08.781 --> 07:10.398
Yeah.

07:10.449 --> 07:12.834
I was there.

07:12.901 --> 07:15.987
You said "slainte" to me before you left.

07:16.055 --> 07:17.755
What do you mean you were there?

07:17.823 --> 07:20.741
Well, Red Bedroom Records is my label.

07:20.793 --> 07:23.344
I own it. And I think you're great.

07:23.412 --> 07:26.514
I would love to meet
with you sometime. I...

07:27.800 --> 07:29.801
Erin?

08:11.612 --> 08:14.412

... for <font color=#00ffff>www.addic7ed.com</font>...

08:14.569 --> 08:16.569
Hi! My name is Alex Dupree.

08:16.785 --> 08:18.102
You might recognize me

08:18.153 --> 08:20.705
from tabloids, rehab, and Internet porn.

08:20.772 --> 08:23.241
But I also do an occasional movie.

08:23.292 --> 08:25.326
Okay. Come on, Alex. Be serious.

08:26.995 --> 08:28.162
Um...

08:29.748 --> 08:32.299
not long ago, I...

08:32.417 --> 08:34.919
I tried to commit suicide.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.453
Uh, okay, maybe not that serious.

08:36.505 --> 08:38.506
Okay. What do you want from me?

08:38.573 --> 08:41.292
I didn't come to town to be
videotaped for your perv collection.

08:41.342 --> 08:42.677
Okay, it's a documentary

08:42.760 --> 08:44.795
about what comes next
for the people in my life.

08:44.847 --> 08:45.980
That sounds really boring,

08:46.064 --> 08:47.348
but that's not why I came back, either.

08:47.432 --> 08:48.850
So why did you come back?

08:50.769 --> 08:52.436
To talk to Chase.

08:52.487 --> 08:55.306
I didn't like the way
things ended with him.

08:55.357 --> 08:57.641
Okay. Perfect.

08:57.693 --> 08:59.660
How did things end with Chase?

09:01.663 --> 09:03.247
Let's see how you like it.

09:03.315 --> 09:04.498
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.284
I'm n... I'm not a
part of the documentary.

09:06.335 --> 09:07.618
You are now.

09:07.669 --> 09:10.087
So, what's up with this
need for sudden male bonding?

09:11.757 --> 09:14.175
Come on, Clarice. Quid pro quo.

09:15.493 --> 09:17.345
Uh...

09:17.429 --> 09:20.097
I need to find a best man for my wedding.

09:25.137 --> 09:28.773
Ohh!

09:28.857 --> 09:30.474
Well, what do you think?

09:30.525 --> 09:32.226
I feel like bridezilla,

09:32.311 --> 09:34.979
and this is my little,
unsuspecting Japanese village.

09:35.030 --> 09:36.647
Ah. Thank you.

09:38.016 --> 09:39.317
To you...

09:39.368 --> 09:40.985
and your wedding.

09:41.036 --> 09:42.954
Two of my favorite things.

09:44.373 --> 09:46.791
Ooh! Matt McGraw photography.

09:46.858 --> 09:49.744
They would be perfect for your wedding.

09:49.828 --> 09:52.463
I'm sure, but I'm actually
gonna ask my friend Quinn.

09:52.530 --> 09:54.632
She is an amazing photographer.

09:54.699 --> 09:57.051
Quinn? Quinn who?

09:57.135 --> 09:58.469
Quinn James.

09:58.536 --> 10:00.922
I've never heard of it.

10:03.058 --> 10:05.092
Okay, um...

10:05.177 --> 10:07.395
Hello.

10:07.479 --> 10:09.096
This is beautiful.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.651
"It"?

10:13.719 --> 10:16.153
Now, is that any way to talk
about one of your oldest friends?

10:16.221 --> 10:17.554
Sorry.

10:17.606 --> 10:19.723
Where did you get... Lucas?

10:19.775 --> 10:21.892
We needed a stunt
mannequin down at the job,

10:21.944 --> 10:24.028
so I had one made that look just like him.

10:24.079 --> 10:26.030
You don't have one of me, do you?

10:26.081 --> 10:28.616
Hell no. That would be weird.

10:33.405 --> 10:35.990
So, what's been up, man? You good?

10:36.058 --> 10:39.076
I was kind of hoping Millie
would be here right now

10:39.144 --> 10:41.679
because Lucas wanted a three-way.

10:41.746 --> 10:44.348
No, that ended when she
went home with a gladiator.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.633
It was Halloween.

10:45.717 --> 10:47.301
At least it wasn't the crow.

10:48.553 --> 10:49.603
You want to talk about it?

10:49.688 --> 10:51.522
Not really.

10:51.590 --> 10:53.057
You want to talk to Lucas about it?

10:53.108 --> 10:54.875
No.

10:54.943 --> 10:56.560
That's cold, man.

10:56.611 --> 10:58.863
Hey, look, at least we're
here to cheer you up.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.115
We're going out, man, so
go ahead and get dressed.

11:02.868 --> 11:04.702
But first, Lucas needs a bath.

11:07.873 --> 11:09.790
Ugh.

11:16.114 --> 11:17.248
Thanks again for the coffee.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.385
It was a peace offering for
the way I've been acting lately.

11:21.453 --> 11:24.305
Guilt coffee, huh? Yum!

11:25.640 --> 11:27.475
Excuse me, bar manager.

11:27.559 --> 11:29.427
When you're done helping that
little boy, can I get a drink?

11:32.931 --> 11:35.733
Can I talk to you? Alone.

11:39.104 --> 11:40.404
I don't think so.

11:40.472 --> 11:42.490
We're in the middle of something.

11:45.577 --> 11:47.862
Fine. Next time, I'll just text you.

11:49.781 --> 11:51.615
Don't bother.

11:51.666 --> 11:54.352
Sorry.

11:54.419 --> 11:56.170
I know that was hard for you.

11:56.254 --> 11:58.055
But...

11:58.123 --> 12:01.125
if you ever need to make
that bitch jealous...

12:01.176 --> 12:03.044
I'm your girl.

12:03.128 --> 12:05.846
Thanks.

12:12.354 --> 12:14.805
Now, there are three things to consider

12:14.856 --> 12:16.357
when selecting a church.

12:16.441 --> 12:17.858
First is pew size.

12:17.943 --> 12:22.063
Um, we are actually gonna
have an outdoor wedding.

12:22.147 --> 12:25.349
Oh. No. No, no, no. What if it rains?

12:25.400 --> 12:27.368
No, my son and
beautiful daughter-in-law

12:27.452 --> 12:29.703
will not be married in
a tent like circus folk.

12:29.788 --> 12:32.490
You can't control mother nature.

12:32.541 --> 12:35.209
Or mother Baker.

12:35.293 --> 12:38.245
And even if it's sunny,
there will be bees.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.631
Well...

12:40.698 --> 12:42.800
But I guess you could always hang salami.

12:42.867 --> 12:45.719
That's what he said.

12:45.804 --> 12:47.088
Wait. What?

12:47.172 --> 12:50.374
Salami keeps away the bees.

12:50.425 --> 12:52.309
But wouldn't that look awful?

12:52.377 --> 12:54.645
You're right.

12:54.712 --> 12:57.648
That's why we should have it inside.

12:59.050 --> 13:00.717
But...

13:05.857 --> 13:07.658
Hey!

13:07.725 --> 13:10.027
Hey.

13:13.165 --> 13:14.949
Hey, you'll never guess who came in today.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.333
Erin?

13:16.401 --> 13:17.751
Alex.

13:17.836 --> 13:19.336
Ohh. Yeah.

13:19.404 --> 13:21.755
She wanted to talk to
Chase, and he blew her off.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.040
Nice.

13:23.091 --> 13:25.242
I think you should talk to Chase

13:25.293 --> 13:29.280
and see if you can convince
him to give her another chance.

13:29.347 --> 13:30.881
Hello? Why would I do that? I don't know.

13:30.932 --> 13:32.800
I'm just trying to give
you the same quality advice

13:32.884 --> 13:34.084
that you gave me earlier.

13:34.136 --> 13:36.753
Open-mike night? Crisis center girl?

13:36.805 --> 13:38.389
Is any of that ringing a bell?

13:38.440 --> 13:39.857
- Okay.
- Yeah, I talked to her today.

13:39.924 --> 13:42.109
I took your advice and told
her how great I thought she was.

13:42.194 --> 13:44.261
And she hung up on me.

13:44.312 --> 13:47.097
Ohh. Whoops.

13:47.149 --> 13:49.766
- "Whoops" is right.
- Well, Haley, you're the counselor.

13:49.818 --> 13:51.569
I mean, you should never
listen to a musician

13:51.620 --> 13:52.903
for help out of a crisis.

13:52.954 --> 13:55.156
We're usually the ones in a crisis.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.107
I'm a musician, too.

13:57.159 --> 13:59.877
Probably part of the problem.

14:10.138 --> 14:12.223
Nathan Scott.

14:12.290 --> 14:13.957
I got to say it's strange discussing

14:14.009 --> 14:16.093
a football player's deal
with a basketball player.

14:16.144 --> 14:18.395
Retired basketball player.

14:18.463 --> 14:19.780
Yeah, I was sorry to hear that,

14:19.848 --> 14:21.465
but I can't say I was sorry to see you go.

14:22.784 --> 14:24.768
You gave our hawks a bit
of trouble last season.

14:24.819 --> 14:26.804
Well, hopefully I can make that up to you

14:26.872 --> 14:29.023
- by getting Troy onto the field.
- That'd be nice.

14:29.107 --> 14:30.441
We're trying hard on our end,

14:30.509 --> 14:32.976
but his former agents didn't
exactly help his situation.

14:33.028 --> 14:35.412
And that's why they're his former agents.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.865
So, can you tell me
where things broke down?

14:37.949 --> 14:40.751
We agreed on everything except
for one-timers and escalators.

14:42.220 --> 14:44.922
What did you have in mind
in terms of escalators?

14:46.174 --> 14:48.158
What do you think I said, Clay?

14:48.210 --> 14:49.793
The only escalator I know about is the one

14:49.844 --> 14:52.096
I'm riding down from the office
where I looked like an idiot!

14:52.163 --> 14:54.548
Whatever. I'm coming home.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.136
Ohh. Here we go!

15:06.293 --> 15:07.927
Oh, we can skip this section.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.212
I'm gonna make the
bridesmaids dresses myself.

15:10.330 --> 15:11.681
I think all my girlfriends

15:11.765 --> 15:14.267
deserve a sexy Brooke Davis original.

15:14.334 --> 15:16.168
Sexy bridesmaid?

15:16.219 --> 15:17.470
Ohh.

15:17.521 --> 15:19.188
Those two don't go together.

15:19.273 --> 15:21.557
No, honey, the whole point
is for them to look ugly

15:21.642 --> 15:24.393
so that you look pretty, right?

15:24.478 --> 15:27.930
Well, I'm gonna look fine regardless.

15:27.998 --> 15:31.117
Sylvia, ugly bridesmaids
dresses make me sad.

15:31.184 --> 15:34.870
They get one night out where
they just get made fun of.

15:34.955 --> 15:37.073
And then it's off to
the back of the closet,

15:37.157 --> 15:39.325
where they emerge as a
bad joke on Halloween.

15:39.376 --> 15:41.627
Oh, g...

15:41.695 --> 15:44.413
look how ugly this one is.

15:44.498 --> 15:47.416
You're gonna look so beautiful.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.306
And there are no messages?

15:55.175 --> 15:58.427
Oh, okay. Yeah. Thanks. Bye.

16:00.013 --> 16:02.481
Maybe she's just busy. You know?

16:02.549 --> 16:04.266
I'm sure she'll call again.

16:04.351 --> 16:05.735
I'm sure she will...

16:05.819 --> 16:08.788
to tell my supervisor I violated
the one rule that they have.

16:08.855 --> 16:10.439
Haley, I'm so sorry.

16:10.524 --> 16:12.158
You shouldn't listen to me. I'm an idiot.

16:12.225 --> 16:15.661
It's not your fault. I just...

16:15.729 --> 16:17.780
I should've listened to that monkey.

16:17.864 --> 16:19.181
I'm the idiot.

16:21.585 --> 16:24.370
I looked like an idiot.

16:24.421 --> 16:26.071
I doubt you looked that bad.

16:26.123 --> 16:27.573
Trust me. I did.

16:27.624 --> 16:29.575
I am never going to Tric again.

16:29.626 --> 16:31.877
And why does Mia always have to be there?

16:31.928 --> 16:33.512
Uh, isn't her label there?

16:35.182 --> 16:37.916
Chase just flirted with
her right in front of me.

16:37.968 --> 16:40.302
I mean, why do guys do stuff
like that? I have no idea.

16:40.387 --> 16:41.920
I'll ask the guys later today

16:41.972 --> 16:44.240
if I can figure out a
way to bond with them.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.359
Guys aren't that tough
to figure out, Julian.

16:46.426 --> 16:48.894
They like sex and poker.

16:48.962 --> 16:51.647
I go with sex, but I'd
suggest you go with poker.

16:51.732 --> 16:52.931
Hmm.

16:52.983 --> 16:54.650
Isn't it a little late for a poker game?

16:54.735 --> 16:55.951
So tell them it's for Clay.

16:56.036 --> 16:58.537
I mean, who'd turn that
down? The guy almost died.

16:58.605 --> 17:00.956
That's genius. You're really
good at trapping people.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.208
I know, right?

17:02.275 --> 17:04.460
Oh, and invite Chase
and let me be the dealer.

17:04.544 --> 17:06.494
That will give me a chance to corner him

17:06.563 --> 17:07.963
without that troll lurking around.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.784
Like, really good at trapping people.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.722
You should've seen the
way he looked at me.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.957
I haven't felt that
stupid since high school.

17:19.009 --> 17:21.794
And at least then I could beat
somebody up to feel better.

17:21.845 --> 17:25.431
Well, don't beat yourself up.
It was just your first try.

17:25.482 --> 17:27.566
Did you make the first
basket you ever shot?

17:27.634 --> 17:29.635
- Yeah.
- Oh.

17:29.686 --> 17:30.903
To be fair, I was 2,

17:30.970 --> 17:32.638
and the basket came up to my waist.

17:32.689 --> 17:34.940
But stats is stats.

17:36.777 --> 17:38.644
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

17:38.695 --> 17:40.663
I screwed up pretty bad with Erin today.

17:40.747 --> 17:43.332
She called in, and I told her
I had seen her perform live,

17:43.417 --> 17:44.667
and she hung up on me.

17:44.751 --> 17:46.952
I'm sorry, babe.

17:47.003 --> 17:48.838
So we're both a couple
of screw-ups, then.

17:48.922 --> 17:50.673
Always and forever.

17:52.626 --> 17:55.044
Ohh.

17:56.996 --> 17:58.214
Ah.

17:58.298 --> 17:59.932
Brooke. Julian.

17:59.999 --> 18:02.668
Hello?

18:04.554 --> 18:07.223
Get your prego ass to
the wedding expo, pronto!

18:07.307 --> 18:08.841
Hi, Brooke. Love you too.

18:08.892 --> 18:11.227
I'm serious. Julian's
mom is out of control.

18:11.311 --> 18:13.446
She's making me try on
tiaras and wedding dresses.

18:13.513 --> 18:15.064
I thought you were making your own.

18:15.148 --> 18:17.283
Well, so did I, but
apparently Sylvia doesn't care.

18:17.350 --> 18:19.401
She's even picking out
the bridesmaids dresses.

18:19.486 --> 18:21.019
And she wants them to be ugly, Haley!

18:21.071 --> 18:22.354
On purpose!

18:22.405 --> 18:24.039
I'm on my way.

18:24.124 --> 18:28.043
Ohh, you know what that dress is missing?

18:28.128 --> 18:29.462
Style?

18:29.529 --> 18:32.381
That's right. A smile.

18:35.669 --> 18:37.470
Well, I have another crisis to deal with,

18:37.537 --> 18:39.338
and if it's anything like this morning,

18:39.389 --> 18:41.557
Brooke's gonna cancel the
wedding before tonight.

18:41.641 --> 18:42.892
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

18:42.976 --> 18:45.344
I'm gonna gamble all our
money away in a poker game.

18:45.395 --> 18:47.980
Rad! Screw-up superpowers activate.

18:51.050 --> 18:53.269
Am I gonna have to give you
a pep talk before every call?

18:53.353 --> 18:56.188
You act like you're
asking these guys to prom.

18:56.239 --> 18:58.240
I should've called Clay
first. What if he says no?

18:58.325 --> 19:00.109
Then I have to call Nathan back.

19:00.193 --> 19:02.528
Wow, Julian, I haven't
seen you this nervous

19:02.579 --> 19:04.663
since I took my clothes
off in front of you.

19:04.731 --> 19:07.199
Just call, you wuss.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.285
Okay.

19:11.738 --> 19:14.957
Hey, Clay. It's "J." J-man.

19:15.041 --> 19:17.226
Jamie. What's up, little man?

19:17.294 --> 19:18.544
I heard you found a frog.

19:18.595 --> 19:20.245
Um, no. It's Julian.

19:20.297 --> 19:22.882
Uh, Baker. Brooke's fiancé. The movie guy.

19:22.933 --> 19:25.301
We hung out in Utah.

19:25.385 --> 19:27.136
Wait. Jamie found a frog?

19:27.220 --> 19:29.138
Um, anyway, uh, never mind.

19:29.222 --> 19:33.142
Um, I'm just having some
guys over for poker tonight.

19:33.226 --> 19:35.427
You know, poker night. You busy?

19:37.063 --> 19:39.782
No. Uh, not busy.

19:39.866 --> 19:43.485
Okay, well, I... I'll see you later, then.

19:43.570 --> 19:45.788
Yes! He said yes! Yes!

19:45.872 --> 19:47.239
Whew! Nice!

19:47.290 --> 19:48.707
Okay. Great.

19:48.775 --> 19:50.108
Good job.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.878
Oh, no. It's a text from
Nathan. He's probably canceling.

19:52.946 --> 19:55.965
Okay, take it easy, sensitive Julian.

19:56.049 --> 19:58.217
He wants to have the
game at his house instead.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.418
Oh.

20:04.474 --> 20:06.425
Probably for the best.

20:15.891 --> 20:17.105
Hey, Julian's here.

20:17.143 --> 20:18.493
Hey!

20:18.561 --> 20:19.878
Come sit next to me, J-man.

20:19.945 --> 20:21.296
No, he's sitting next to his best man.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.447
- I'm his best man.
- No, no, I'm his best man.

20:23.499 --> 20:25.166
No, no, no, no. I'm his best man.

20:25.251 --> 20:26.718
I'm bar manager!

20:26.785 --> 20:29.453
Guys, guys, you can all be my best men.

20:32.925 --> 20:34.008
Yeah!

20:36.178 --> 20:38.096
Okay. Okay.

20:38.147 --> 20:39.714
Be cool, Julian. Just... just be cool.

20:39.782 --> 20:41.015
Be yourself.

20:45.020 --> 20:46.237
Hey, guys.

20:49.358 --> 20:51.192
W... what's wrong?

20:53.529 --> 20:54.829
Julian's here!

20:54.914 --> 20:59.751
Hmm. A girl. At poker night.

20:59.818 --> 21:01.319
Good going, Julian!

21:04.440 --> 21:07.175
Ohh.

21:11.997 --> 21:14.098
Please, Sylvia, no more dresses.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.633
You're right.

21:15.684 --> 21:17.051
This is the one.

21:19.438 --> 21:20.688
Hey!

21:20.773 --> 21:23.892
What a random and...

21:23.976 --> 21:26.477
total coincidence.

21:26.529 --> 21:28.196
My best friend Haley is here!

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
- Oh?
- Unexpectedly.

21:29.348 --> 21:31.015
- Where?
- Let's see what she thinks.

21:31.066 --> 21:31.983
Hales!

21:35.704 --> 21:38.039
Oh, my God.

21:38.123 --> 21:41.543
You look so beautiful.

21:43.028 --> 21:44.195
Hi.

21:44.246 --> 21:46.047
Hi.

21:46.131 --> 21:48.917
Well, I told her this is the one.

21:49.001 --> 21:51.419
I'm gonna put these two back.

21:51.503 --> 21:53.704
Okay.

21:53.756 --> 21:56.090
Are you kidding me, Haley?!
I called you here to help me!

21:56.175 --> 21:57.592
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I... you're right.

21:57.676 --> 21:59.561
I forgot how much my hormones
act up when I'm pregnant.

21:59.645 --> 22:00.762
Sorry.

22:00.846 --> 22:02.513
I'm so excited you're getting married!

22:13.158 --> 22:15.193
If this impresses you,
I can also cut the deck

22:15.261 --> 22:17.245
- with my tongue.
- Hmm.

22:17.329 --> 22:19.730
You ladies know how to
play hold 'em, right?

22:19.782 --> 22:21.532
No-limit. When you're out, you're out.

22:21.584 --> 22:23.251
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold
on. Those are Lucas' chips.

22:23.335 --> 22:25.569
Sorry, Lucas.

22:25.621 --> 22:27.755
- There you go.
- Thanks.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.625
Oh, yeah. I'm in.

22:30.709 --> 22:33.244
So, how's the documentary
coming along, Julian?

22:33.295 --> 22:36.464
Wow. I'm surprised you
didn't send me to ask him.

22:36.548 --> 22:38.099
Uh, really well, actually.

22:38.183 --> 22:40.218
Oh, word? What's it about poker?

22:40.269 --> 22:41.519
No, it's about the people around me

22:41.586 --> 22:43.104
as they enter the next
chapter of their lives.

22:43.188 --> 22:46.107
Ahh. Poker sounds better.

22:46.191 --> 22:48.359
Which people?

22:48.427 --> 22:50.278
Actually, I've spent the
last few days filming Mouth.

22:50.362 --> 22:52.096
So you're following up
your successful indie

22:52.147 --> 22:53.398
with a documentary about Mouth?

22:54.599 --> 22:55.733
What's wrong with that?

22:55.784 --> 22:57.235
It's just weird.

22:57.286 --> 22:59.203
I mean, he hasn't even filmed
me yet, and I'm your boss.

22:59.271 --> 23:02.156
Which reminds me, who said
you could have the night off?

23:02.241 --> 23:03.725
Uh, Lucas did.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.877
You know, and since he
owns Tric, he's your boss.

23:05.944 --> 23:07.378
Ha ha! My dawg!

23:09.999 --> 23:11.466
So, Clay, how you feeling?

23:11.550 --> 23:13.551
A hell of a lot better
since I got out of the house.

23:13.618 --> 23:15.119
I was going a little bit stir-crazy.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.088
Are you kidding me? I could never get sick

23:17.139 --> 23:19.424
of a house where you can
see the ocean from your bed.

23:25.064 --> 23:26.914
How do you know that?

23:28.801 --> 23:31.635
So, who needs a snack?

23:33.489 --> 23:34.656
Ooh!

23:34.740 --> 23:36.524
You two are just in time.

23:36.608 --> 23:38.976
Steve over here gave us a deal

23:39.028 --> 23:42.313
on the last baby angel made of pÃ¢te.

23:44.649 --> 23:45.983
Okay.

23:46.035 --> 23:48.619
Can... can we just slow down a bit?

23:48.671 --> 23:50.505
I... I wanted to come here to get ideas.

23:50.589 --> 23:54.709
But I don't really want to
commit to everything right away.

23:54.793 --> 23:56.461
Well, regardless,

23:56.512 --> 23:59.347
- you are gonna have to pick a
caterer at some point.
- Mm-hmm.

23:59.431 --> 24:02.633
Unless your friend "Quint" can cook, too.

24:02.685 --> 24:06.354
Quinn. Quinn. She's Haley's older sister.

24:06.438 --> 24:08.523
Oh, Quinn can't cook to
save her life, mnh-mnh.

24:08.607 --> 24:09.857
- Well...
- No.

24:09.942 --> 24:11.859
Actually, we were thinking,

24:11.944 --> 24:13.728
rather than a traditional dinner,

24:13.812 --> 24:15.179
we might have a constant flow

24:15.230 --> 24:17.181
of appetizers throughout the night

24:17.232 --> 24:19.984
so people can mingle and dance,

24:20.035 --> 24:21.352
and there's always new food.

24:21.403 --> 24:24.688
No, no, no. People come to
a wedding expecting dinner.

24:24.740 --> 24:27.191
Can't just pass around snacks
like a backyard hootenanny.

24:28.693 --> 24:31.195
How about a tuscan feast
with a carving station?

24:32.631 --> 24:34.248
I think that's a bit much for me.

24:35.700 --> 24:38.636
Don't you think, Haley?

24:38.703 --> 24:40.755
That sounds awesome.

24:42.057 --> 24:43.891
Right.

24:43.976 --> 24:45.476
Of course you slept with Clay.

24:45.544 --> 24:47.595
Were you researching to
be an agent or a slut?

24:47.679 --> 24:49.147
That was before I even knew you.

24:49.214 --> 24:51.432
You act like I'd sleep with... anyone.

24:51.517 --> 24:52.700
Hey.

24:52.768 --> 24:54.602
No offense, Fergie.

24:54.686 --> 24:56.738
I'm Junk.

24:56.822 --> 24:59.723
Everybody always mixes them up.

24:59.775 --> 25:00.942
Lauren didn't.

25:01.026 --> 25:03.327
Right. She got you and Mouth mixed up.

25:03.395 --> 25:06.030
Hey, why you got to bring me into this?

25:06.081 --> 25:08.866
Hear that, Alex? Mouth's available if
you need to study more on bartending.

25:08.917 --> 25:11.586
But this time, at least
try being honest about it.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.404
I never lied to you.

25:13.455 --> 25:16.424
No. You just conveniently left
out the part about using me.

25:16.508 --> 25:19.961
I guess it was easier to let
me figure it out for myself.

25:20.045 --> 25:21.712
There's a lot of that going around.

25:21.764 --> 25:24.932
Oh, dude, come on. How long
are you gonna stay mad at me?

25:25.017 --> 25:27.051
I'm just saying, if I wanted
to look stupid, I would've

25:27.102 --> 25:29.270
stayed at home and played
trivial pursuit against Haley.

25:29.354 --> 25:30.555
I didn't have to go to Atlanta.

25:30.606 --> 25:31.973
What were you doing there?

25:32.057 --> 25:33.858
I don't know.

25:33.925 --> 25:35.726
Clay, what was I doing in Atlanta?

25:35.778 --> 25:37.645
I mean, besides making an ass of myself?

25:40.149 --> 25:42.567
Uh, full house.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.487
I'm beat.

25:46.572 --> 25:48.539
Nice call, Julian. Poker night.

25:59.763 --> 26:02.581
Two bucks.

26:02.633 --> 26:05.518
Clay, please, tell everybody
here what I was doing in Atlanta.

26:05.585 --> 26:08.054
Well, I sent him to Atlanta
so that he could talk

26:08.105 --> 26:09.639
to the Falcons' management,

26:09.723 --> 26:11.590
but he got stuck on an escalator.

26:11.642 --> 26:13.476
I always hated escalators
when I was little.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.594
I thought the teeth at the
bottom were gonna eat my feet.

26:18.732 --> 26:20.032
I'm glad you think it's funny.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.534
You know what... if being an agent

26:21.601 --> 26:23.119
means setting up your friends to fail,

26:23.203 --> 26:24.570
I don't want to be a part of fortitude.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.374
Two more.

26:28.441 --> 26:30.877
What's fortitude?

26:30.944 --> 26:32.712
It's my agency.

26:32.779 --> 26:34.797
Sounds like it belongs on one
of them inspirational posters

26:34.882 --> 26:37.166
with a dude paddling a canoe.

26:37.251 --> 26:39.085
I have one of those hanging in my office.

26:39.136 --> 26:41.087
You mean above the bar?

26:41.138 --> 26:42.922
You should name it adobe.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.224
Aw, hell.

26:45.292 --> 26:47.059
Adobe is bricks made out of clay.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.011
So it would be like the
agency built from clay.

26:49.096 --> 26:50.296
All right, now, that's cool.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.764
The name of the agency is fortitude.

26:51.815 --> 26:53.349
I like adobe better.

26:53.433 --> 26:54.967
Whatever, "Skills."

26:55.018 --> 26:56.819
Okay. I'll play.

26:59.773 --> 27:01.774
Two pair.

27:01.825 --> 27:04.243
Uh, three aces.

27:07.497 --> 27:08.981
Who needs another drink?

27:11.251 --> 27:12.952
Champagne!

27:13.003 --> 27:14.704
Listen to me... unless you want your baby

27:14.788 --> 27:17.089
to be born with a dent in
its head the size of my fist,

27:17.157 --> 27:19.091
you had better start agreeing with me.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.260
Hear that, baby? That's
auntie Brooke's way

27:21.328 --> 27:24.096
of saying she can't wait to meet you. Hmm!

27:24.164 --> 27:25.765
Oh, wouldn't this champagne fountain

27:25.832 --> 27:28.000
look beautiful at your reception?

27:28.051 --> 27:29.185
It's...

27:29.269 --> 27:31.053
not really my taste.

27:31.138 --> 27:32.671
Well, what kind of wedding

27:32.723 --> 27:34.523
doesn't have a champagne fountain?

27:34.608 --> 27:36.776
- Mine.
- Mine, either.

27:38.729 --> 27:40.229
I wish it did, though.

27:40.314 --> 27:42.031
I do. Brooke, it's so cool. Come on.

27:42.115 --> 27:44.533
This is like a fountain of happiness.

27:44.618 --> 27:46.852
Ahh. That's what I thought, too.

27:46.903 --> 27:49.071
I know. You know, just
excuse us for one second.

27:49.156 --> 27:50.406
I want to show Haley something.

27:50.490 --> 27:51.690
What did you want to show me?

27:51.742 --> 27:53.192
- The exit.
- Why?

27:53.243 --> 27:55.027
I love you, but your hormones

27:55.078 --> 27:56.495
are not helping me right now.

27:56.546 --> 27:59.198
Fine. But go easy on her, okay?

27:59.249 --> 28:01.050
She's so excited for you!

28:01.134 --> 28:03.002
You're doing it again! Go.

28:08.875 --> 28:11.177
Mm-hmm.

28:11.244 --> 28:13.062
What's wrong with my name?

28:13.146 --> 28:14.764
Well, it's not even a real name.

28:14.848 --> 28:16.649
I mean, what is it you're so skilled at?

28:16.716 --> 28:18.401
Everything.

28:18.485 --> 28:22.388
I think nicknames are cool.
You never had one, Clay?

28:22.439 --> 28:24.774
Oh, no, he don't need one,
remember? He has "fortitude."

28:25.993 --> 28:27.610
So, how'd you get yours, Fergie?

28:27.678 --> 28:29.211
My name's Ferguson.

28:29.279 --> 28:29.996
Oh.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.285
Uh, my parents own a junkyard.

28:36.370 --> 28:38.754
Bet you want to sleep with me now.

28:38.839 --> 28:42.091
She would if they did a
remake of "Sanford and son."

28:43.243 --> 28:44.877
Oh, so, Mouth...

28:44.928 --> 28:47.546
uh, there's got to be a great
story behind that nickname.

28:47.597 --> 28:49.882
- I have a few guesses.
- When we were kids,

28:49.933 --> 28:53.269
I used to do commentary for
games at the river court.

28:53.353 --> 28:55.421
Then one day, Nathan came up to me,

28:55.472 --> 28:57.690
said I had a big mouth,
and punched me in it.

28:57.757 --> 28:59.308
After that, it kind of stuck.

29:00.644 --> 29:01.760
No, I didn't.

29:01.812 --> 29:03.979
Yes, you did. You hit him hard, too.

29:04.064 --> 29:06.399
Damn it. I...

29:06.450 --> 29:08.818
I was a jerk back then. I'm sorry, Mouth.

29:08.902 --> 29:10.286
It's okay. It was a long time ago.

29:10.370 --> 29:12.271
And besides, I like "Mouth"
better than "Marvin."

29:12.322 --> 29:14.457
You see that, Clay?

29:14.541 --> 29:16.775
That's how friends
apologize to each other.

29:16.827 --> 29:19.128
I'm glad I never had a nickname.

29:20.414 --> 29:21.630
Yeah, you did.

29:21.715 --> 29:23.165
What was it?

29:27.454 --> 29:29.121
"Chaste."

29:37.130 --> 29:40.399
Okay. Hey... oh, she's...

29:43.437 --> 29:45.137
Hey, Haley. Isn't your shift over?

29:45.188 --> 29:46.489
Uh, yeah, I just came by

29:46.573 --> 29:49.475
to see if anybody called
or left me a message.

29:49.526 --> 29:50.826
Oh.

29:50.911 --> 29:52.745
No. Were you expecting someone?

29:52.812 --> 29:55.364
No. I guess not.

29:58.001 --> 30:01.287
Shut up, monkey.

30:01.338 --> 30:03.255
Why Chaste?

30:03.323 --> 30:07.042
Because he was in the
virgin club in high school.

30:07.127 --> 30:08.878
Uh, I'm all-in.

30:08.962 --> 30:11.497
It was called the Clean Teens.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.849
I'm all-in, too.

30:13.934 --> 30:16.519
- Yeah, yeah, that's better.
- At least I was a virgin by choice.

30:16.603 --> 30:19.805
I think that's sweet. We didn't have
anything like that in my high school.

30:19.856 --> 30:21.140
Of course not. You went there.

30:21.191 --> 30:22.674
I'm all-in, too.

30:26.012 --> 30:28.614
Okay. Trip jacks.

30:28.681 --> 30:30.015
Straight.

30:30.066 --> 30:31.984
- Flush.
- Full house.

30:32.035 --> 30:35.404
Royal flush.

30:35.489 --> 30:37.206
- Great.
- Well, that's everything.

30:37.274 --> 30:39.909
No money, no job. Thanks, Julian.

30:39.993 --> 30:41.076
Thanks, Clay.

30:41.161 --> 30:42.628
- Thanks, Julian.
- Thanks, Julian.

30:42.695 --> 30:44.180
Thanks a lot. Great party. Good time.

30:57.668 --> 31:00.569
So, who wants to be my best man?

31:06.093 --> 31:07.876
Excuse me.

31:07.928 --> 31:10.262
Have you seen a middle-aged
woman with short hair

31:10.347 --> 31:12.315
running around here like she's the bride?

31:12.382 --> 31:15.434
Uh, you just described every mom here.

31:15.519 --> 31:17.403
Right.

31:17.487 --> 31:20.556
She's probably stuffing
the champagne fountain

31:20.607 --> 31:23.109
with bee-repellent salami
into the back of my car.

31:23.193 --> 31:24.560
"Come down to the expo.

31:24.611 --> 31:26.779
We'll have a good time,
have a few laughs."

31:26.863 --> 31:29.615
Yippee-ki-yay, mother Baker.

31:29.700 --> 31:34.203
I've been hanging around Julian too long.

31:34.254 --> 31:36.672
Come on, Sylvia!

31:50.712 --> 31:52.079
Oh. I'll take that.

31:52.130 --> 31:53.748
Ahh.

31:53.799 --> 31:56.050
You guys want to grab a drink at Tric?

31:56.117 --> 31:58.002
Uh, that would've been a great idea

31:58.086 --> 31:59.337
about, what, an hour ago,

31:59.421 --> 32:01.305
before Julian cleaned everybody out.

32:01.390 --> 32:02.757
No, I'm buying. See, I'm bar...

32:02.808 --> 32:06.427
Manager. Yeah, we know.

32:06.478 --> 32:08.846
Hey, man. Can I talk to you for a second?

32:08.930 --> 32:11.198
Yeah.

32:21.476 --> 32:23.194
10 bucks for your thoughts.

32:23.278 --> 32:25.946
I had a big night.

32:27.449 --> 32:29.033
Are you okay?

32:32.003 --> 32:33.821
I never got to talk to Chase.

32:33.872 --> 32:35.623
He was just so mean all night.

32:36.925 --> 32:39.260
Wow. I... I... I didn't
think it was bothering you.

32:39.327 --> 32:40.378
You seemed fine.

32:41.930 --> 32:43.431
I'm an actress, Julian.

32:46.718 --> 32:49.053
The whole reason I flew
back was to apologize to him,

32:49.137 --> 32:51.856
and I never got the chance.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.508
Now it's worse than when I last left.

32:54.559 --> 32:57.344
Then fix it. Everyone's over at Tric.

32:57.396 --> 33:00.848
You can go over there
and apologize to him now.

33:00.899 --> 33:03.534
But when you do, just be yourself.

33:03.618 --> 33:05.319
Don't act.

33:06.705 --> 33:10.023
Why not? I'm a great actress.

33:10.075 --> 33:12.743
Yes, you are, but you're
an even better person.

33:12.828 --> 33:14.462
Let him see that.

33:14.529 --> 33:17.415
Ah. I'm not that good of a person.

33:17.499 --> 33:19.049
I've been dealing you cards

33:19.134 --> 33:20.918
from the bottom of the deck all night.

33:21.002 --> 33:23.504
That wasn't luck?

33:23.555 --> 33:25.372
Nope.

33:25.424 --> 33:28.876
It's probably why your male
bonding didn't go so well.

33:28.927 --> 33:31.228
I forgot that guys hate to lose money

33:31.313 --> 33:33.431
more than they like sex and poker.

33:33.515 --> 33:35.099
I'm sorry.

33:35.183 --> 33:36.684
That's okay.

33:36.735 --> 33:39.854
I've always been better friends
with girls anyway. Come on.

33:42.407 --> 33:44.057
You're right.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.244
Well, that's the best start to
a conversation I've ever heard.

33:48.997 --> 33:53.284
I... I'm sorry I didn't
prepare you for Atlanta.

33:53.368 --> 33:55.619
It's fine.

33:55.704 --> 33:58.088
I don't think I'm cut
out to be an agent anyway.

34:00.008 --> 34:02.910
I never studied in school 'cause
I could shoot a basketball.

34:03.011 --> 34:05.679
That's exactly why you
should become an agent.

34:05.747 --> 34:07.381
Why? Because I never studied?

34:07.432 --> 34:09.632
No, because you could shoot a basketball.

34:09.717 --> 34:11.619
Look, not many of us on this side

34:11.686 --> 34:13.888
ever played or understand
what that's like.

34:13.955 --> 34:15.556
You know, but you do.

34:15.607 --> 34:17.358
And the rest of the stuff you can learn.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.110
I don't know.

34:20.195 --> 34:21.896
Yeah, but I do.

34:21.947 --> 34:24.447
Look, man, I know you struggled today.

34:24.533 --> 34:27.935
But my instincts tell me that
you're gonna be great at this.

34:29.771 --> 34:32.239
And Troy must agree with me

34:32.290 --> 34:35.108
because he wants you to be his agent.

34:38.112 --> 34:41.114
Congratulations, you
signed your first client...

34:41.166 --> 34:43.050
who happens to be a first-round pick.

34:43.117 --> 34:45.219
Not a bad start.

34:48.507 --> 34:49.924
I...

34:49.975 --> 34:52.560
I've never had a business card before.

34:52.627 --> 34:54.395
Oh. Thanks, man.

34:54.462 --> 34:56.263
And, uh, by the way,
an escalator clause...

34:56.313 --> 34:59.633
it's just an incentive based
on playing time and performance.

34:59.684 --> 35:02.436
So, basically, it's a
fancy word for a bonus?

35:02.487 --> 35:03.771
See? Look at that.

35:03.822 --> 35:05.940
You're already talking like an agent.

35:05.991 --> 35:08.275
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:08.326 --> 35:11.028
Hey, Clay.

35:12.747 --> 35:15.683
Fortitude. Strong name.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.835
It is, right?

35:24.659 --> 35:25.993
Thank you, Brooke.

35:26.044 --> 35:27.211
Mm.

35:27.295 --> 35:29.430
You are wonderful.

35:29.497 --> 35:30.848
And you are drunk.

35:32.217 --> 35:35.102
And thank you for loving my Julian.

35:35.169 --> 35:37.388
He makes it easy.

35:37.472 --> 35:41.141
He is so happy.

35:41.192 --> 35:43.861
And that means the world to me.

35:47.866 --> 35:50.317
Ohh.

35:50.368 --> 35:52.403
I always wanted a daughter.

35:54.072 --> 35:55.656
And today was...

35:55.707 --> 35:58.876
well, it was just everything
that I dreamed it would be.

36:00.462 --> 36:03.581
I had fun, too.

36:03.665 --> 36:04.698
Get some sleep.

36:04.749 --> 36:05.716
Mm-hmm.

36:08.369 --> 36:12.723
Please don't tell Julian
that I was drinking.

36:12.807 --> 36:16.226
He worries.

36:35.396 --> 36:36.697
Nice studio.

36:40.068 --> 36:41.902
I was kind of expecting a bedroom.

36:44.405 --> 36:47.091
Um, j... listen, Erin.

36:47.175 --> 36:50.744
About earlier, I'm... I'm so sorry.

36:50.795 --> 36:53.013
I should never have betrayed your trust.

36:55.350 --> 36:58.719
Let me ask you a question.

36:58.770 --> 37:00.638
Did you really like my music?

37:00.722 --> 37:04.558
Or did you just not want
a suicide on your hands?

37:06.394 --> 37:08.395
I really liked it.

37:26.631 --> 37:29.249
I'm sorry about the way I left things.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.669
And I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about the movie.

37:31.753 --> 37:35.172
I just... I knew if I did,
it would ruin what we had.

37:35.256 --> 37:39.226
And I loved what we had.

37:39.293 --> 37:41.145
I should have told you that.

37:42.931 --> 37:45.983
Huh. That's a good speech. Who wrote it?

37:46.067 --> 37:48.602
No one. It's the truth.

38:00.281 --> 38:02.416
I guess the truth hurts, huh?

38:10.324 --> 38:13.177
Sorry. I just...

38:16.965 --> 38:19.466
You're in the movie now, boss.

38:19.517 --> 38:22.102
Thanks, Skills. This did cheer me up.

38:36.968 --> 38:38.902
So, how was the expo?

38:38.987 --> 38:41.121
Your mom had a good time.

38:41.189 --> 38:43.540
Ah. What about you?

38:45.293 --> 38:47.494
We had a good time.

38:47.545 --> 38:49.379
How'd bonding go?

38:49.464 --> 38:50.831
Oh, guys are mean.

38:50.882 --> 38:53.834
I missed being in the Brooke bubble.

38:53.885 --> 38:56.303
Well, yeah.

38:56.370 --> 38:58.538
'Cause it's the best place ever.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.724
Not that I've ever really been out of it.

39:00.809 --> 39:02.226
Mm.

39:02.310 --> 39:03.594
It wasn't a total loss, though.

39:03.678 --> 39:06.730
I won 200 bucks, and I found my best man.

39:06.815 --> 39:09.099
Oh, yeah?

39:13.655 --> 39:15.889
Oh... No.

39:15.940 --> 39:19.026
I won him from Skills. What do you think?

39:19.077 --> 39:21.528
I think you are never allowed

39:21.579 --> 39:23.497
out of the Brooke bubble again.

39:23.564 --> 39:27.117
It's either him or junk/Fergie.

39:27.202 --> 39:29.703
Okay.

39:29.754 --> 39:32.673
"Best mannequin" it is.
Make sure he gets a tux.

39:35.877 --> 39:38.345
Put that thing...

39:38.412 --> 39:40.881
why is there salami hanging from the lamp?

39:40.932 --> 39:42.683
I saw a bee.

39:51.976 --> 39:54.427
- So, guess what?
- What?

39:54.479 --> 39:57.114
Erin is gonna come back tomorrow.

39:57.198 --> 39:59.783
I guess I didn't mess up
as bad as I thought I did.

39:59.868 --> 40:02.152
You never do.

40:02.237 --> 40:04.437
Turns out I didn't, either.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.957
Troy Jameson wants me to be his agent.

40:07.041 --> 40:09.076
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

40:09.127 --> 40:11.044
Oh, my God! That's amazing!

40:11.112 --> 40:13.413
See? I'm so proud of you.
I knew you could do it.

40:13.464 --> 40:15.916
I haven't really done anything yet.

40:15.967 --> 40:18.669
You signed the first
client that you talked to.

40:18.753 --> 40:19.920
That's one for one.

40:19.971 --> 40:22.005
It was luck, Hales.

40:22.090 --> 40:23.590
Stats are stats. You said so yourself.

40:25.059 --> 40:26.894
Well, I guess neither of
us are screw-ups after all.

40:26.961 --> 40:29.062
I guess not.

40:32.183 --> 40:35.135
You picked up Jamie from
Chuck's house, right?

40:35.186 --> 40:36.937
I thought you did. Ohh.

40:36.988 --> 40:39.022
- Screw-ups.
- Screw-ups.
