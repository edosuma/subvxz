01:16.240 --> 01:18.240
All right, so you got your
visiting room over here,

01:18.320 --> 01:21.120
which is where your mommy or
daddy will come and visit you.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.600
You gotta put their names on the list.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.720
This area, down here, out of bounds,

01:24.800 --> 01:26.480
okay, guys, until you
get assigned down here...

01:26.560 --> 01:30.160
Ooh! They must've locked
you up for your own good.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.600
Hey, don't be afraid, little girl.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.160
Daddy can protect you
from the criminal element.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.320
All right, Boo, keep
it in your pants, okay?

01:39.480 --> 01:41.320
Come on. Forget about them.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.920
Oh, my God.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.600
Oh, shit, she is risen!

02:20.120 --> 02:21.360
Shit.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.360
Shit.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.280
Oh, shit!

03:06.560 --> 03:09.280
Five, four, three, two, one, go!

03:10.560 --> 03:12.360
Man, I don't know who
the fuck this is. Pass.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.000
- Uh! No passing.
- But I don't know...

03:14.080 --> 03:17.160
Man, time's running out! Say, like,
"it sounds like," or something.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.240
Uh, all right, rhymes with Bleve Blerwin.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.040
Man, she's cheating! You
can't do no "rhymes with"!

03:22.120 --> 03:23.360
What the fuck I was supposed to do?

03:23.440 --> 03:24.920
Stupid ass people ain't
nobody ever heard of.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.960
- Time!
- I know!

03:28.640 --> 03:30.640
Man, Steve Irwin. The Crocodile Hunter?

03:30.720 --> 03:32.120
Rest in peace, B-T-dubs.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.720
All right, my turn! Ready, P?

03:33.800 --> 03:36.520
Whoo! We got this.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.200
And... three, two, one, go!

03:40.160 --> 03:42.760
- Uh, crazy dude who believes in aliens?
- Tom Cruise.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.840
Yes, ma'am. Okay, okay. Um...

03:44.920 --> 03:47.920
- Basketball. Uh, nerd glasses.
- LeBron.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.200
- Other one.
- D-Wade.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.800
- Yes, ma'am.
- Man, what the fuck?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.600
Yo, chick whose husband died real young.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.240
- The white Michelle Williams!
- Yes, yes.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.160
Time! You're outta time!

03:58.880 --> 04:01.320
Uh-uh, now, see, as long as
y'all two playing, I quit.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.080
Yo, yo, ain't our fault you
ain't current on your Us Weekly.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.320
Stars, they're just like us, Mackenzie!

04:08.800 --> 04:10.960
Yo, you think I could try?

04:11.040 --> 04:14.360
Man, how many times I got to tell
you we need you on clock duty?

04:14.440 --> 04:16.200
And I like clock duty.

04:16.280 --> 04:19.160
Yeah, watching the clock
and smelling the clock.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.000
But, you know, I was thinking, with
my dramatic skills, I could play...

04:22.080 --> 04:24.720
Yo, son, you straight up
lost your mind last time.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.400
All hitting yourself in the head and shit.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.600
Yeah, we still can't
play Jenga 'cause of you.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.120
Yo, well, look, thing is,
we already got a even number.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.320
- So, come on, J, you up.
- Clock duty.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.920
- All right, come on, J.
- Okay.

04:44.160 --> 04:50.160
And... five, four, three,

04:50.240 --> 04:52.600
two, one.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.360
Blastoff!

05:00.160 --> 05:02.800
I dressed myself, Mama!

05:03.920 --> 05:07.000
She's so pretty.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
Isn't she?

05:08.160 --> 05:10.720
She looks like you and Daddy.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.240
Mommy and Daddy made her, honey.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.440
She's our miracle.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.200
Can I hold the miracle?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.920
Here, sit back right here.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.240
Now, just be extra careful.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.120
Make sure to support her head.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.880
What's she called?

05:37.680 --> 05:38.920
Grace.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.120
Hello, Grace.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.280
I'm your best friend and
your big sister, Suzanne.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.960
Just me and you. You and me. You and I.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.080
Okay, honey, that's enough for now.

05:48.160 --> 05:52.000
She's had quite a journey today.
You can hold her again later.

05:52.080 --> 05:55.600
No! She's my baby! You give her back!

05:55.680 --> 05:58.960
You told me she was mine! She's
mine! Give her back! Give her back!

05:59.040 --> 06:00.920
Suzanne, stop it, be a big girl.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Do something.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.400
- But I have the baby!
- Give her to me.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.600
No! No! No!

06:04.680 --> 06:06.320
Hey! Hey!

06:06.400 --> 06:08.640
It's pretty exciting being
a big sister, isn't it?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.800
You know, I couldn't wait to meet
my little brother when he was born.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.280
But you know what? That
kid cried for a whole year.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.840
I even asked my mommy if she
could put him back in her tummy.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.840
Hey, would you like me to fix your hair up?

06:24.920 --> 06:27.840
It seems you should have a fancy
do to go with that fancy outfit.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.200
Ooh! I love, love your wings.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.480
Thank you, pink's my favorite color.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.760
Oh, I can see that.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.640
Nice.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.560
All right, there, Chapman. Well,
looks like it's your lucky day, hun.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.240
Oh.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.880
Ah!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.200
Come on.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.600
It's like family.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.880
Oh, I never thought I'd be
so happy to be back here.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.600
Blondie!

07:06.680 --> 07:08.480
I thought they'd shipped you away for good.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.800
I heard you gave what's-her-boobs
a pretty good beatdown.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.160
Didn't know you had it in you.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.280
You beat someone up?

07:20.160 --> 07:22.440
Yes, I did.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.600
- What's your name again, hun?
- Soso.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.400
No, no, no, I said what's your name?

07:31.480 --> 07:34.240
Yeah, that's my name. Brook Soso.

07:35.480 --> 07:41.720
Oh. Um, funny story, my parents named me
Brook after Brooke Shields, the actress.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.920
Um, but except without the "e,"

07:44.000 --> 07:45.760
'cause they thought it
would be a bit more original.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.000
But sometime around my 10th birthday,

07:48.080 --> 07:51.280
they started saying I was
named after a brook instead.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.880
Um, like the babbling kind.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.360
That's funny.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.040
Proving once again, you can
either be pretty or smart.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.760
Yeah, chemo makes her cranky.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.760
Why don't you take the
bunk above Chapman, okay?

08:08.840 --> 08:12.520
Oh, I got something for
you. We got a toothbrush...

08:14.240 --> 08:16.040
and soap.

08:16.120 --> 08:21.200
I don't normally bend the rules like
this, but you don't look full... Asia.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.040
Well, thank you.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.520
- Seriously, for everything.
- Bah!

08:26.600 --> 08:29.400
This is not how I imagined
prison to be at all.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.400
Hey.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.120
What happened to her?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.360
Oh!

08:35.440 --> 08:37.000
Well, she got burned.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.400
Anyway, I got a van run
in a couple of minutes.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.160
Rosa, I will see you
tomorrow for your appointment.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.000
Oh! I almost forgot.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.760
Chapman, brushy brush and soapy soap.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.240
We didn't know if you were coming back.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.360
Yeah.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.080
Me, either.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.400
You have another one of those?

09:11.400 --> 09:14.480
Oh. I'm real sorry, hun, I don't.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.840
One of the black girls didn't
come round when you got in?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.800
That's a shame.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.120
Leanne, I feel free as a bird.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.240
No, like, not even a bird,
like a snake! More like a snake.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.760
Like an anaconda.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.280
Like, I had to, like, shed that scaly skin

09:35.360 --> 09:37.880
'cause it just didn't
suit me anymore, you know?

09:37.960 --> 09:41.080
Why are you talking like one of
those puppets with a hand up its butt?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.840
I'm not.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.560
I'm just smiling. See?

09:48.640 --> 09:49.960
I don't care what you say,

09:50.040 --> 09:51.960
they did something funny
to you up in that hospital.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.000
Exactly!

09:54.080 --> 09:56.560
What do you think is different
about me? How do I look?

09:56.640 --> 09:59.560
I don't know, you're acting
a little, like, retarded.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.240
I'm not retarded, I got new teeth!

10:07.560 --> 10:08.960
Oh.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.640
"Oh."

10:13.360 --> 10:14.440
You're jealous.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.680
No.

10:17.320 --> 10:22.000
Are you jealous that I'm kind
of pretty now and you're not?

10:23.960 --> 10:26.720
Mama says pretty's for
flowers and movie stars,

10:26.800 --> 10:28.680
'cause neither one's got a brain.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.160
So, what are you saying? I'm not smart?

10:34.280 --> 10:35.920
Well, I'm saying...

10:37.640 --> 10:40.240
I'm saying you're acting
like you're better than us,

10:40.320 --> 10:42.480
and we don't like it.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.600
Okay...

10:47.680 --> 10:49.520
You know what, Leanne, maybe you
are onto something, all right?

10:49.600 --> 10:54.720
Maybe I am tired of being down here,
folding y'all's dirty panties, all right?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.520
You wanna know the goddamn truth?

10:57.080 --> 10:59.680
Maybe I wanna aim higher...

10:59.760 --> 11:02.600
for myself.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.600
Yeah, you do that, Tucky. You aim
as high as the ceilings in here.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.600
You might even be able
to lick all the boogers

11:17.680 --> 11:19.880
people have flicked up there.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.880
Ah!

11:32.960 --> 11:36.880
Do you have anywhere else to be? Anywhere?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.640
Nope! Exactly nowhere to be.

11:38.720 --> 11:43.440
Then I'll find somewhere else to
be because you are annoying as shit.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.200
I was adopted, you know.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.440
Good for you. I wasn't.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.520
Weren't you?

11:52.480 --> 11:53.440
No.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.400
I'm sorry to hear you feel that way.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.160
You're not even supposed to be in here.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.080
I got my ways.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.560
There's so much blood rushin' to my head,

12:01.640 --> 12:03.920
I'm starting to feel like a tick!

12:04.000 --> 12:05.960
You know how they bite a
deer and then it's like...

12:06.040 --> 12:07.360
Don't interrupt.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.800
Taystee...

12:15.760 --> 12:17.600
I had to go into hiding.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.280
I needed you when I was out...

12:22.640 --> 12:24.240
and you was nowhere to be found.

12:24.320 --> 12:29.400
Couldn't even be bothered enough
to leave a note or nothing.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.840
Baby, that wasn't personal.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.640
I had every cop above
125th Street looking for me.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.880
I couldn't tell anybody
where I was. It was too risky.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.280
'Course not.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.120
'Cause you ain't too good at
risky when it comes to yourself.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.080
Where I come from, we
call that "chicken shit."

12:47.720 --> 12:49.040
I had my reasons.

12:49.120 --> 12:53.680
You know, I'm feeling like I
already gave you too much of my time.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.840
And I don't need your explaining,
and I don't need you...

12:57.920 --> 12:59.320
especially in here.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.720
Ooh!

13:07.000 --> 13:09.080
Thanks for being patient,
letting me finish.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.360
Taystee mad at you?

13:11.520 --> 13:12.520
Seems that way.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.760
Don't take it personal.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.040
I try not to.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.680
Now, I know what you gonna say.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.600
"But Suzanne, my heart hurts!"

13:21.680 --> 13:25.640
And I hear you, I do. A lot.

13:25.720 --> 13:30.400
But you gotta put your head down,
keep on buffing those floors.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.800
Clockwise... and counter-clockwise.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.240
'Cause sometimes people just
don't wanna play with you,

13:40.320 --> 13:41.880
and that's okay.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.400
You work on the maintenance crew?

13:45.480 --> 13:47.760
I do. I do.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.240
Um...

13:50.320 --> 13:52.800
My specialty is buffing, though.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.840
That's an impressive skill.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.280
Thank you, thank you.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.160
And, uh...

14:04.960 --> 14:07.040
by the way, who are you?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.360
I'm Vee.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.240
It's nice to meet you, Suzanne.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.680
Hey...

14:23.760 --> 14:24.880
you in orange.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.560
You're out of bounds.

14:26.640 --> 14:29.520
Don't let me see you in here
till you're wearing beige.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.560
Remember, only one piece of cake.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.200
And, Suzanne, don't forget
to wear your night guard!

14:54.280 --> 14:55.920
Hi, Grace! The girls are in the game room.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.080
They're just getting
ready to watch a movie.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.640
Why don't you girls go on
down and join the party?

15:01.720 --> 15:03.200
- Have a great time.
- Bye. Mom!

15:04.280 --> 15:05.640
I hope you don't mind.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.280
We just feel it's important for Suzanne

15:07.360 --> 15:09.400
to have the same social
development as Grace.

15:09.480 --> 15:14.280
I don't think it's appropriate
for Suzanne to be here.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.840
Fine. Let's cut the bullshit,
then, is this because she's black?

15:21.160 --> 15:23.920
She's 10 years old and it's a
birthday party for 6-year-olds.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.160
You know which kids suffer
in this world, Melanie?

15:26.240 --> 15:27.920
The ones who are told they're different.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.160
The ones who aren't given
the opportunity to succeed

15:30.240 --> 15:32.040
alongside every other kid their age.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.400
And I'll be damned if I
label my child "less than"

15:35.480 --> 15:37.560
so that the rest of the
world can put her in a box

15:37.640 --> 15:41.360
and dismiss her before she's
had a chance to succeed in life.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.000
I'm sure she'll have a great time tonight.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.120
Daya.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.160
Oh, hey.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.040
No, just stay there.
You... Can you hear me okay?

16:10.120 --> 16:11.760
Yeah, I can hear you.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.960
I couldn't find you. I
didn't think you came here.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.240
What, are you saying I don't read?

16:16.320 --> 16:20.280
What? No, of course not. I was
just saying that I didn't...

16:20.360 --> 16:22.520
This isn't one of your typical...

16:22.600 --> 16:25.160
I'm sorry, it's the hormones.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.920
I'm real sensitive right now.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.560
It's okay.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.920
So, um, how's your day?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.720
Well, it's fine.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.760
I had some special enchiladas
for lunch. That was good.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.560
Mmm? Yeah.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.920
How are you?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.160
Uh, tired,

16:51.240 --> 16:54.280
stayed up real late last
night watching the game.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.000
What you reading there?

16:56.080 --> 17:00.320
They got pregnancy
magazines and stuff in here.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.960
Look, this whole article is on folic acid.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.360
That sounds dangerous.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.520
No, it's actually good
for the baby and shit.

17:10.080 --> 17:13.040
It says we have better chances of not
having a retarded kid if I take it.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.520
Daya... Daya, you don't need
to worry about stuff like that.

17:17.600 --> 17:22.360
Look... my mom didn't
take vitamins or whatever,

17:22.440 --> 17:25.280
and I think it's safe to say
that yours didn't, either.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.800
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. No, I just meant...

17:30.080 --> 17:31.040
Never mind.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.480
- I wanna be better than my mom.
- I know...

17:34.560 --> 17:37.000
I want this baby to have everything.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.440
I'm gonna tell them that I'm pregnant.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.480
What?

17:44.920 --> 17:46.360
Daya, you can't do that.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.400
What if there's something
wrong with the baby, John?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.120
Daya, we have been over this.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.440
Half of the girls know
anyway. I don't get...

17:52.520 --> 17:53.720
But not the administration.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.920
So what? I can't...

17:55.000 --> 17:56.760
Looking to edumacate
yourself there, Bennett?

17:57.640 --> 18:00.040
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.080
Seventy-three hundred.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.480
Careful, no one likes a,
uh, well-read beefcake.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.520
I want to look fierce.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.440
Fierce? Fierce.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.680
Second one.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.320
Tired of throwing them pity
parties for yourself, huh?

18:18.400 --> 18:19.720
I don't do pity.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.720
Honey, those roots are saying otherwise.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.040
Dmitri coming to visit this weekend?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.080
No.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.040
- Somebody inside?
- Don't be ridiculous.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.480
If it ain't sex, what's got you
crawling out of that gutter of bad hair?

18:37.720 --> 18:41.640
Ever look at yourself and realize
how other people must see you?

18:41.720 --> 18:43.920
You caught the whole
used-to-be-a-man thing, right?

18:47.880 --> 18:52.120
A woman I knew a long time
ago came back in yesterday.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.000
Oh!

18:54.080 --> 18:55.840
So you wanna impress her?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.880
More like intimidate her.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.640
"Don't fuck with me."

19:01.760 --> 19:03.360
I got just the color for that.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.280
And then these.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.800
I'm sorry, Franny, your
reception's not so good.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.920
It sounded like you said that
Christopher's getting married.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.560
He's gettin' married?

19:19.880 --> 19:21.240
Why would he?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.440
He's movin' to Albany?

19:25.560 --> 19:28.800
I don't... But... Oh, my God.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.360
It's her.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.280
He's movin' into her house.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.200
But that's less than an hour from here.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.560
He's tryin' to rub it in my face!

19:42.200 --> 19:45.600
I will fuckin' strangle that fuckin' cooze.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.120
I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, Franny. No, no, I'm sorry.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.840
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'.
I really am. Uh-huh.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.640
Now, honey, real quick, just before I go,

20:00.720 --> 20:03.440
why don't you tell me when is it?

20:05.720 --> 20:08.760
I can find a fuckin'
newspaper if I want to.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.160
Just tell me when it is.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.840
I'm your sister, for cryin' out loud.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.840
My poor baby, he's so confused.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.960
He doesn't realize she's a whore.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.160
You don't go Jessica
Simpson when you got Rihanna.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.080
Yes. Yes. Yes, I know that
Rihanna is black, thank you.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.080
But... I know that, too.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.640
Okay. All right.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.320
Yes. Yes, I understand.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.840
I'll be a good girl. Okay.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.800
I love you. I love you, too. Okay, bye.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.200
God!

20:57.760 --> 20:59.040
Everything okay?

21:00.200 --> 21:02.000
I'm great!

21:06.240 --> 21:08.880
Hey, Andrew? Hey, Larry.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.480
- Of course.
- Yeah, yeah, thanks for meeting me.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.920
Oh, yeah.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.960
Uh, so, like I said in my
email, loved your NPR piece.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.200
Oh, well, thanks.

21:17.280 --> 21:20.760
Well, um, I read City Post religiously.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.160
I was really excited to get your email.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.800
I'm hoping you can put
me in touch with Piper.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.040
Oh. Uh...

21:29.680 --> 21:31.320
Wait, what? Why?

21:31.400 --> 21:34.400
I'm doing a story on
Litchfield. She's my way in.

21:35.880 --> 21:36.880
What's your angle?

21:36.960 --> 21:39.120
Fraud, embezzling.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.320
They filed plans for a gym that
supposedly broke ground two years ago.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.840
We're talking 6,000 square
feet. Hard to hide, right?

21:45.920 --> 21:48.560
But when you look on Google
Earth, no new structures.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.320
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, man.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.560
I just need someone in there
who can help corroborate

21:52.640 --> 21:54.560
and maybe, you know, sniff around for me.

21:54.640 --> 21:55.800
Well, uh...

21:56.760 --> 21:58.680
you know, I'm, uh...

21:58.760 --> 22:02.160
I'm pretty deep into, uh... journalism

22:02.240 --> 22:04.880
with the prison story.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.000
Um, you know, and it's not just Piper.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.080
I mean, her counselor
and I? We talk regularly,

22:10.160 --> 22:13.760
so, yeah, I mean, I'd
be a really great asset.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.880
Great.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.200
You tell Denise I don't care what
her mother heard on The Today Show.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.720
I got nothing here gluten-free.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.120
So if she dies from a
gluten overdose or whatever,

22:31.200 --> 22:32.880
then who am I to stand in the way of fate?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.960
Prison is gluten.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.640
Don't commit the crime if you
can't fuckin' have flour, got it?

22:41.280 --> 22:42.800
Here, I'll tell her myself.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.520
Hey, you gettin' any
more greens up in here?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.280
Yo, I miss that creamed corn, man.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.640
- Word!
- Yeah.

22:48.720 --> 22:52.400
Yeah, well, I'd give my left tit
for a piña colada and a smoke,

22:52.480 --> 22:55.040
but you don't see that on the menu, right?

22:57.760 --> 22:58.840
Mmm.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.640
Piña colada do sound good, though.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.480
All right.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.720
So you and me, we're, like,
snatch sisters now, right?

23:11.800 --> 23:14.320
Can we not talk about my
ex-girlfriend's vagina?

23:14.400 --> 23:15.480
I hate to be a stickler here,

23:15.560 --> 23:19.880
but isn't it more like
ex-girlfriend-mistress-life-ruiner?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.800
Is everybody...

23:23.880 --> 23:26.160
Is everybody staring at me right now?

23:26.240 --> 23:28.720
Because I really feel like
everyone's staring at me.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.640
It's great to see you evolving, Chapman.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.040
And getting past the whole

23:32.120 --> 23:34.640
"I'm the star of my own movie
and everyone else's, too" complex.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.760
Do I do that?

23:37.600 --> 23:40.080
You know, you really hurt her.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.400
I don't wanna talk about that.

23:41.480 --> 23:45.520
She came running to me
like an injured lamb.

23:45.600 --> 23:51.280
Yes, a lamb with great, sexy glasses and
giant pillowy tits inside of my mouth.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.520
Alex Vause was never a lamb.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.440
She is the wolf that eats the lamb.

23:59.520 --> 24:03.320
You can't blame the wolf. Lamb's
delicious, that's smart eating.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.080
Watch yourself, Chapman.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.520
Oh, I can't believe she got out.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.040
System's fucked.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.640
They got your number now, honey.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.840
What are you looking at?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.160
I knew them bitches was lying

24:19.240 --> 24:22.000
when they said you left here
looking like Omar from The Wire.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.440
See, I told you everybody's
talking about me.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.840
Relax, Omar.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.640
Oh.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.320
What, you gonna beat the
shit out of me now, too?

24:35.400 --> 24:36.800
Just tell me the safe word.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.120
I missed you.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.040
Yeah, I missed you, too.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.320
You okay?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.240
Fine, fine.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.600
Just a little antsy lately.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.360
Oh, not me. This place is a
spa compared to where I've been

24:53.440 --> 24:54.560
for the past few weeks.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.120
I thought the water tasted like cucumbers.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.360
Man, it sounds like it
was a fucking nightmare.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.880
I spent a lot of time wondering
if it would matter if I died.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.440
In the macro sense, no.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.280
You're one Cheerio in the bulk box of life,

25:14.400 --> 25:19.000
but... you fuckin' tickle me,
so I think it would matter.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.080
Cindy, right?

25:33.040 --> 25:34.560
Depends.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.120
I'm told you work in the warehouse.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.120
Nah, got a real sweet gig
as a Rockette right now.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.880
Would you be willing
to do an errand for me?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.080
Mmm!

25:47.360 --> 25:48.400
Well, ain't you real polite,

25:48.480 --> 25:51.080
using your white folks'
words to get free work.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.240
I have something hidden in
one of the electrical sockets

25:56.320 --> 25:59.000
behind where they stack
the broken down boxes.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.720
I'd be very grateful if you
could retrieve it for me.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.440
Bitch...

26:05.520 --> 26:08.800
if grateful paid the bills,
we'd all be Bill Gates.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.480
Know what I'm sayin'?

26:19.680 --> 26:20.920
Missed a spot, right there.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.080
Here.

26:38.040 --> 26:42.160
Suzie, you want the Chipmunks or the
Muppet Babies sleeping bag this time?

26:42.240 --> 26:45.200
- Get out of here, I'm changing.
- So?

26:45.280 --> 26:46.640
I'm starting to become a woman,

26:46.720 --> 26:49.920
and Mom says I shouldn't let
people see my bathing suit parts.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.440
I'll take the Muppets tonight.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.160
Please don't be weird.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.440
I'm not weird.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.360
I'm just like everyone else.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.520
"Once upon a time, there
was an extra pretty girl... "

27:01.600 --> 27:04.640
And then, Grace, you go,
make up the next part,

27:04.720 --> 27:07.400
- and then we'll go around the circle.
- Okay.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.560
Once upon a time... there
was an extra pretty girl

27:12.640 --> 27:16.920
who lived in a huge house on
top of a hill with her family.

27:20.840 --> 27:25.200
But then a dragon came swooping in,

27:25.280 --> 27:29.200
breathing fire out of its dragon
nostrils and lights the house on fire.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.120
Some of her family runs outside,

27:31.200 --> 27:34.240
but the little girl gets
trapped inside by herself.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.200
She screams for help,

27:37.280 --> 27:39.480
but no one wants to come back and save her,

27:39.560 --> 27:42.720
so she sits and she cries by herself...

27:44.640 --> 27:48.200
and gets burned up by
the fire and dies alone.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.960
That's not how it goes.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.560
But now it's more interesting.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.600
No! That's stupid.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.720
You're stupid.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.960
But dragons are cool.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.080
Huh?

28:26.440 --> 28:29.760
Hey, hey, hey, Brook. Brook? Brook?

28:30.840 --> 28:32.800
I thought everyone goes
by their last names.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.280
They do, but I can't say yours with
a straight face right now, so...

28:37.840 --> 28:39.240
Try to take some deep breaths.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.400
Deep breaths. Deep breaths, okay.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.120
Do you wanna take some
breaths with me, Chapman?

28:45.200 --> 28:46.160
No.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.320
You know, when I was WWOOFing
on a walnut farm in Xenia...

28:49.400 --> 28:50.920
While you were what-ing?

28:51.000 --> 28:55.080
WWOOFing. Willing Workers On Organic Farms.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.280
Where is Xenia?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.640
It's in Ohio.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.840
You should probably just say
"volunteering in Ohio" from now on.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.680
It's pretty misleading otherwise.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.320
Okay, well...

29:05.200 --> 29:09.520
Meadow said this really amazing thing...

29:09.600 --> 29:10.560
Meadow?

29:12.040 --> 29:13.160
Is that a person?

29:13.720 --> 29:16.000
Yeah, she's my best friend.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.200
Oh.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.920
Was my best friend.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.320
Anyway, she said...

29:25.280 --> 29:28.720
"Brook, be a grasshopper."

29:30.080 --> 29:32.520
And it just made so much sense, you know?

29:32.600 --> 29:34.120
No, I don't.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.360
It's about the synchronicity
of life, Chapman.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.080
I miss her so much.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.760
- Meadow.
- It's fine. It's gonna be fine.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.880
You seem so calm.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.960
Are you a murderer?

29:50.040 --> 29:51.320
No, I'm not a murderer!

29:51.400 --> 29:53.560
Don't yell at me! I'm
really scared right now!

29:53.640 --> 29:56.040
- Shut up!
- Hey, hey, hey. Okay, I know, I know.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.320
You know, I cried my
whole first night, too.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.640
It gets easier. You'll adjust.

30:05.720 --> 30:10.720
You'll find friends, and pretty soon
the food is not gonna make you dry-heave

30:10.800 --> 30:12.560
and, you know, you'll even
get the hang of pooping

30:12.640 --> 30:14.640
while making eye contact with somebody.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.440
Everything ends, Brook.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.000
Even prison.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.040
Try to focus on that.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.560
Here are some tissues.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.320
I think I'm finding friends already.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.760
Okay, all right.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.280
Should I go check on the
table? It's been 45 minutes.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.520
I'm sure the hostess is good at her job.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.160
Right.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.240
- Do you want another drink?
- I'm good.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.280
So how's Piper doing?

31:08.440 --> 31:11.960
- Pardon?
- Piper? Your ex-fiancée who's in prison?

31:12.040 --> 31:13.600
It's...

31:13.680 --> 31:17.760
It feels... weird that
you're asking me about her.

31:17.840 --> 31:21.480
Well, would it be weirder if I
pretended not to know about you?

31:21.560 --> 31:23.560
Because, you know, even
if your dad hadn't told me,

31:23.640 --> 31:25.440
it is the 21st century

31:25.520 --> 31:28.640
and a quick click on Google can give
me any information that I need, so...

31:30.000 --> 31:32.880
I like efficiency. Let's
just skip the small talk.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.880
I don't... I don't know how Piper is.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.160
- We're not speaking at the moment.
- Smart.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.360
Uh, I'm sorry, my dad said you
were a pediatrician of some sort?

31:42.440 --> 31:43.680
Pediatric neurologist.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.200
Here I am, 29 years old and
really impressive to parents.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.160
- Do you live with them?
- Who?

31:51.240 --> 31:52.520
Your parents.

31:53.800 --> 31:54.880
What? No.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.080
No, did he say that?

31:58.160 --> 32:00.880
What, no, it's just, they seem
pretty involved in your life.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.000
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

32:07.840 --> 32:09.120
So you working on anything right now?

32:09.200 --> 32:11.360
Oh. Uh...

32:11.440 --> 32:14.160
Yeah, you know, I mean...

32:14.240 --> 32:17.880
I'm considering some options. I'm
trying to figure out what's next.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.360
Oh, no, that's great.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.280
I... You know, I am just
so tired of going on dates

32:22.360 --> 32:24.400
where I have to listen to guys go on and on

32:24.480 --> 32:26.000
about how they're turning
their Twitter feeds into blogs,

32:26.080 --> 32:27.960
their blogs into books, and
their books into Twitter feeds.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.360
It's exhausting.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.520
Stop pretending that your
podcast is work, right?

32:31.600 --> 32:32.880
Right.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.720
No, it's just...

32:34.800 --> 32:37.480
it's really refreshing that
you're not doing anything.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.560
Yeah?

32:39.640 --> 32:41.160
No, it's great.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.480
A guy without ambition
is at the top of my list.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.560
Someone who's happy to stay
at home with our three kids

32:46.640 --> 32:48.000
while I take care of other people's.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.400
Did you want kids, because your
Facebook profile didn't say?

33:00.320 --> 33:01.320
Shut up.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.880
Hello?

33:44.360 --> 33:46.800
Whoa! Ow!

34:34.720 --> 34:36.840
Diaz, your side of the
bunk is looking dirty.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.440
I suggest you take a maxi
pad to that floor, stat,

34:39.520 --> 34:40.840
if you wanna pass inspection.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.920
Did you get my gift?

34:46.760 --> 34:47.720
Yeah.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.760
What's wrong? I... I
thought you'd be excited.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.000
Yeah, I've been dreaming
about meeting a man

34:53.080 --> 34:55.920
who will leave a bag of raw
spinach underneath my pillow

34:56.000 --> 34:57.760
with a note that says, "For my baby."

34:58.320 --> 34:59.800
You're a real Prince Charming.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.680
Fuck diamonds, I got spinach!

35:01.760 --> 35:05.320
Spinach has folic acid in it. A lot.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.880
And... I even got the organic kind.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.440
The guys up front are
calling me Popeye now.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.200
They think it's my lunch!

35:12.280 --> 35:14.360
John, I ain't gonna eat a
whole bag of spinach every day.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.920
I'm not a fucking rabbit.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.040
Yep.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.080
The pre-natal vitamins have all
kinds of other stuff in them, anyway.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.680
Look, I...

35:21.760 --> 35:24.040
I can't get the pills in, Daya, I'm sorry.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.120
Look, we're not even allowed to
have vitamins in our bags now.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.120
I'll reinspect tomorrow at 7:00 a.m., Diaz.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.000
If you're not gonna be concerned
about the health of our child,

35:38.080 --> 35:39.120
and you don't wanna figure this out,

35:39.200 --> 35:40.360
- then you know what?
- Oh, my God...

35:40.440 --> 35:41.960
- I'm done.
- ... please do not talk like your mother.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.360
It's...

35:44.440 --> 35:45.760
it scares me.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.160
Hey, can we, uh...

35:53.200 --> 35:54.800
Can we meet at our spot later?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.880
I miss touching you.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.400
Go.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.720
What are you doing?

36:37.880 --> 36:39.560
I saw Dandelion.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.080
Try again. What... what
are you trying to say?

36:44.720 --> 36:46.240
Piper.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.040
She hates me.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.920
She's dangerous,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.240
but so am I.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.680
Who? That white girl?

36:56.800 --> 36:58.600
Oh, man, Suzanne.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.680
Listen to me, okay?

37:01.760 --> 37:06.160
In my day, the black women ran this place.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.240
And I say women, because
that's what we were.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.640
Women.

37:10.720 --> 37:14.280
Not a bunch of little girls running
around here with bad attitudes.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.600
Now, I see you, you understand? I see you.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.520
You're a smart, strong, black woman.

37:36.480 --> 37:40.480
Everybody else around here
underestimates you, but not me.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.240
You remember that the next
time you run into Dandelion,

37:44.320 --> 37:46.280
or whatever the hell you wanna call her.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.160
You hold your head up high, you hear me?

37:50.240 --> 37:54.960
Because at the end of the
day, you are a garden rose,

37:55.960 --> 37:57.440
and that bitch is a weed.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.880
Thank you for these.

38:03.800 --> 38:04.920
It's...

38:05.000 --> 38:07.040
it's good to know I have a friend in here.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.600
Jesus fucking Christ, Nichols,
you gotta work on your technique.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.520
No babe ever takes this
long when I'm doing her.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.800
You know, some nuts are
tougher to crack than others.

38:25.880 --> 38:30.040
Oh, please, two in the pink, one in
the stink. It ain't rocket science.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.680
Hey, I'll be out in a second!

38:32.760 --> 38:36.520
Yes! Oh, my God! Yeah!

38:36.600 --> 38:38.560
We have a touchdown.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.040
We're no longer accommodating
any bullshit allergy requests.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.440
Listen, I'm just here to tell you that...

38:47.520 --> 38:51.200
the habanero sauce last night at
dinner was almost as good as La Rica's.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.680
How you know La Rica?

38:53.760 --> 38:56.320
Spiciest salsa in New York.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.480
Best salsa in New York.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.080
Oh, yeah, you're a good imitator.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.040
I'll take that as a compliment.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.400
It was meant as such.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.600
I'm Vee.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.280
Welcome to prison.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.320
Welcome back, actually.

39:19.640 --> 39:21.480
I was just wondering, if we could...

39:23.040 --> 39:24.000
make a trade.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.320
Flip the top.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.840
Well, the gang's all here,
huh? Chapman, welcome back.

39:47.520 --> 39:51.840
Miss Doggett, you're looking... rested.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.520
Uh? No? Really?

40:02.800 --> 40:04.240
You didn't notice my teeth?

40:05.480 --> 40:06.960
Dang it.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.600
Well, I got new teeth, 'cause
she knocked my old ones out.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.920
I think we can all agree there were some...

40:13.000 --> 40:16.160
dental issues before
the fight, Miss Doggett.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.120
Mr. Caputo, I would just like to say

40:19.200 --> 40:21.360
that I am prepared to
behave like a model inmate

40:21.440 --> 40:23.120
and I feel I no longer pose a threat.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.480
Spare us, Chapman, this
isn't a beauty pageant.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.760
I wanted to see you both so
we can put this all behind us.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.480
Bury the hatchet...

40:31.560 --> 40:33.880
or something with a
little less violent history

40:33.960 --> 40:35.360
than that particular idiom.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.200
From an administration perspective,
you're both found at fault.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.680
Case closed.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.040
But she didn't hit me.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.840
While I admire your incessant
need to be special, Chapman...

40:49.640 --> 40:50.600
she did.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.240
No, no, no, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

40:52.320 --> 40:54.960
Unless you'd like to explain
how else you wound up in the snow

40:55.040 --> 40:57.120
with your face bashed in...

40:59.720 --> 41:00.920
Ah, I didn't think so.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.480
I presume your ego will be all right

41:02.560 --> 41:04.840
with Miss Doggett getting a few punches in,

41:04.920 --> 41:08.400
seeing as how you're both enjoying
the cozy comforts of minimum security

41:08.480 --> 41:10.880
instead of rotting away in the SHU.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.760
I'd like to assume we're all
squared away here, ladies.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.560
Well? Can I?

41:20.680 --> 41:21.640
Assume that, huh?

41:22.720 --> 41:24.040
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.680
Good.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.640
Perhaps you'd like to, uh...

41:28.720 --> 41:29.760
hug?

41:31.840 --> 41:35.000
To help assure me of your new friendship?

41:35.080 --> 41:36.480
Are you serious?

41:52.800 --> 41:55.360
Good, okay, you may go.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.760
Peace be with you.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.080
Close the door behind you.

42:20.640 --> 42:21.640
No.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.280
Well, you haven't changed a bit.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.200
Oh! I'm sure there are a few differences.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.040
You've been well?

43:04.120 --> 43:06.800
Never better, till I landed back in here.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.440
- All the new drug laws these days.
- Nasty business.

43:10.520 --> 43:12.520
You didn't say hello to me
in the bathroom yesterday.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.920
I didn't see you in the
bathroom. You're mistaken.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
I must be.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.720
I'm sorry to see that
you're not in the kitchen.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.240
The food now is... no bueno.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.440
Perhaps that will help with your weight.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.040
Yeah, well, at least black don't crack.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.560
You're right, nothing has changed.

43:38.480 --> 43:42.080
Oh, Red, I'm getting too old for this shit.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.600
I've been back here two days and
already I can see the game has changed.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.400
It has.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.000
Yeah.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.840
I think this time I'm just
gonna keep my head down,

43:53.920 --> 43:57.080
read my books, do my time
like the good Lord intended.

43:57.640 --> 44:01.880
These old bones just need a
little bit of peace and quiet.

44:01.960 --> 44:03.920
That sounds nice.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.600
Ambitious, and bullshit, but nice.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.880
You're gonna be great, honey.
You did your scale warm-ups?

44:29.960 --> 44:33.080
And now I'd like to
introduce Suzanne Warren,

44:33.160 --> 44:35.920
who will be singing a
special graduation song.

44:46.120 --> 44:50.160
Come on, sweetie, this is your
chance. Go show them how great you are.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.280
No, I can't!

45:24.360 --> 45:29.240
I can't do it, Mom! No! Mom, I can't do it!

45:29.320 --> 45:33.440
I can't! I can't! I can't!

45:34.440 --> 45:36.120
I can't!

45:40.240 --> 45:45.240
♪ Praise the Lord ♪

45:45.320 --> 45:51.720
♪ I saw the light ♪

45:51.800 --> 45:56.720
♪ Now I'm so happy,
no sorrow in sight ♪

45:56.800 --> 46:01.280
♪ Praise the Lord, I saw the light ♪

46:08.480 --> 46:12.240
Hee! Hey! Ooh! Hey!

46:12.320 --> 46:15.440
Ooh, I felt alive with the spirit!

46:15.520 --> 46:18.400
Like baby Jesus in the bear suit!

46:18.480 --> 46:19.800
Yeah.

46:19.880 --> 46:21.520
I felt his presence.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.520
You felt his presence...

46:23.600 --> 46:25.680
or did you feel pee running down your leg?

46:28.320 --> 46:31.520
Yo, you know shit is bad
when the mute has to save you.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.040
The mute.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.480
Go ahead, how's it go?
How does it go? Like this?

46:39.560 --> 46:40.920
Am I doing it right?

46:52.800 --> 46:54.520
No, Mommy!

46:54.600 --> 46:55.720
Oh!

46:58.680 --> 47:00.040
I don't want to!

47:00.120 --> 47:02.000
You're always pushing
me to do these things!

47:02.080 --> 47:03.360
Pushing me!

47:03.440 --> 47:06.240
No more, Mommy!

47:08.440 --> 47:09.800
No more.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.080
Can I talk to you?

47:32.040 --> 47:35.800
I'm real sorry for what I
did. Please don't be mad at me.

47:35.880 --> 47:39.600
No, no, Suzanne...

47:41.920 --> 47:43.680
Suzanne, you saved me.

47:44.800 --> 47:48.320
No, I hit you.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.360
In your face.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.200
Like, wham, bam, slam!

47:52.280 --> 47:53.520
Yes, I... But you...

47:54.720 --> 47:57.280
You made it look like it was a fair fight.

47:58.880 --> 48:02.000
You are the whole reason I am back here.

48:02.080 --> 48:05.120
I am so grateful to you.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.720
Do you wanna go see the
movie tonight together?

48:16.160 --> 48:19.720
No, I don't think so, Dandelion.

48:22.080 --> 48:23.800
I'm a garden rose.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.440
Hey, hey.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.120
What's going on, kid?

49:15.200 --> 49:16.960
Did you have another
dream about Mr. Snuffles?

49:18.680 --> 49:21.400
That whore is stealing my date!

49:21.480 --> 49:23.560
What? Are you getting out?

49:23.640 --> 49:26.640
No, no, my wedding date!

49:28.640 --> 49:32.880
Christopher's getting married on my date.

49:32.960 --> 49:35.600
Just like we were supposed to.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.920
Hey, it's... I'm sorry.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.920
Oh, I know he's doing it just to hurt me.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.920
What kind of a woman doesn't
wanna pick her own date?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.560
Someone who doesn't get excited
by the wedding industrial complex

49:49.640 --> 49:52.880
and society's bullshit need
to infantilize grown women.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.560
And she's fat!

49:58.560 --> 50:00.200
Yeah, that's a slut.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.560
Come here.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.720
Fuck Christopher.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.040
I bet he sucks dicks.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.760
What are you doing?

50:15.840 --> 50:17.360
I'm really good, Chapman.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.400
No, I said "what" are you doing.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.880
Just setting my intention for the day.

50:22.960 --> 50:25.120
Well, set your intention on your own bed.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.560
You are so much like Meadow, it kills me.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.680
You know, traditionally, women
are much more communal than men.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.400
That's why most women are less violent.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.840
I read that in a book about
matriarchy in Papua New Guinea.

50:41.760 --> 50:44.720
Anyway, I think that if you
shared a bit more easily,

50:44.800 --> 50:47.040
maybe you wouldn't have
beat that girl up, you know?

50:48.800 --> 50:49.960
No, Soso,

50:51.120 --> 50:53.200
I don't know.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.720
No one has a fucking clue what
you are talking about, ever,

50:56.800 --> 50:59.920
and I definitely do not need your advice.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.160
Ever.

51:01.240 --> 51:05.600
We are not friends, I am
not your new safety blanket,

51:05.680 --> 51:08.640
and I am definitely not
going to be your new Meadow.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.640
I am a lone wolf, Brook.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.000
And a vicious one.

51:18.600 --> 51:21.560
Don't make me rip your
throat out with my teeth.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.000
- Weezy.
- Lil Wayne!

51:36.080 --> 51:37.040
Yeah!

51:37.120 --> 51:38.640
Nah! You can't be all
sayin' their names like that!

51:38.720 --> 51:40.960
- Time!
- Yo, I ain't say shit.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.320
That's his nickname.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.760
And it could've just as easy
been a George Jefferson reference.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.040
Oh, shh...

51:51.040 --> 51:52.560
Yo, what's the deal
with that bitch, anyway?

51:52.640 --> 51:53.800
I don't like her.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.400
Asking favors already,
like she own the damn place.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.720
She used to. That's what
some of the girls were saying.

51:59.800 --> 52:03.120
I don't care 'bout no "used
to." I live in the present.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.760
Namaste and shit.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.560
That's Vee.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.080
Hold up, like... like "Vee," Vee?

52:11.120 --> 52:12.320
Yep.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.200
Why you ain't say nothing?

52:16.120 --> 52:18.080
Uh, who the fuck is Vee?

52:19.080 --> 52:20.920
Basically, like T's mom.

52:32.960 --> 52:33.920
Gracias.

52:39.240 --> 52:42.920
Suzanne! Come get you some cake.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.400
Why she get some cake?

52:58.480 --> 53:00.760
Why can't we get no cake?
Who she think she is?

53:13.280 --> 53:14.800
That is messed up.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.200
Hey, Taystee Girl.

53:17.960 --> 53:18.920
Peace offering.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.120
Funfetti with chocolate icing.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.240
How did you... like, what did you...

53:31.320 --> 53:33.320
I get by with a little help.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.480
Suzanne here played a big part.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.400
Forgive me.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.960
I promise I will never let you down again.

53:54.040 --> 53:56.720
Wasn't I there for you all those years?

53:58.200 --> 54:00.320
Didn't I take care of you?

54:02.480 --> 54:04.480
Let me do the same here.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.040
Why don't you, uh...

54:23.000 --> 54:24.800
invite your friends to join us?

54:24.880 --> 54:27.200
Be a shame to waste all this cake.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.120
Hey!

54:34.880 --> 54:37.040
This is Vee. Vee, this is...

54:37.160 --> 54:38.680
Yeah, yeah, I know.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.760
Janae, Cindy,

54:42.040 --> 54:43.040
Poussey.

54:44.480 --> 54:45.680
Ladies...

54:46.600 --> 54:48.880
- are you hungry?
- Yep.

54:56.240 --> 54:59.240
So, what was that game
y'all were just playing?

54:59.320 --> 55:02.480
Don't work with an
uneven number. No offense.

55:02.560 --> 55:04.120
Well, I count six of us.

55:04.200 --> 55:06.160
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.880
Someone needs to keep time.

55:08.960 --> 55:12.440
Well, everybody can
take turns keeping time.

55:13.920 --> 55:16.280
You think, maybe,

55:16.360 --> 55:18.880
we should mix up them teams,
right? Don't you think?

55:19.880 --> 55:22.040
I don't see why not.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.360
You know, I had a feeling about you.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.480
Knew we would get along.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.240
Man, you so full of shit, your eyes brown.

55:32.320 --> 55:34.520
Duh!

55:34.600 --> 55:37.080
Here, let me help you with that, baby.

55:39.200 --> 55:42.320
You know, I think it's time
we found you a new look, Suzie.

55:42.400 --> 55:45.560
Oh, but this is how I've always done it.

55:47.520 --> 55:51.200
Maybe it's time to just, you
know, air it out a little bit.

56:02.440 --> 56:05.240
These are stale as fuck!
Where'd you get these, 1983?

56:07.840 --> 56:09.720
Motherfucker.
