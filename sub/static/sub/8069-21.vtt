WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:07.275
[theme music]

00:56.757 --> 00:58.759
That'll be $15.

00:58.792 --> 01:02.630
And give me two for Iris.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.697
Oh, that's all right.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.166
You don't have to
tip me, Mrs. Wellman.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.468
After all, I only
shampooed your hair,

01:07.501 --> 01:09.570
brought you coffee, put
quarters in your meter,

01:09.603 --> 01:11.071
and walked your little dog.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.742
Oh, and don't think
I don't appreciate it.

01:14.775 --> 01:18.412
Now, could you just get my
coat and carry Jacques out

01:18.446 --> 01:19.380
to my car?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.581
I'm parked right
around the corner

01:20.614 --> 01:22.183
in front of that Korean market.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.652
I hope they haven't
watered my car.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.720
I don't want to spoil
Debbie's lovely work.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.860
I'm gonna go ahead
and go on to the bank.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.228
Here, allow me.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.497
Oh, thank you, Roxanne.

01:36.530 --> 01:41.001
Come on, Jacques,
you little mutt.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.337
I think that's disgusting.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.372
You mean Meg?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.573
Yeah, I mean Meg.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.808
That woman walked all over
Roseanne for 11 years,

01:47.841 --> 01:49.109
and she's still doing it.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.010
She's rich.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.712
She doesn't know any better.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.813
[tires squealing]

01:52.846 --> 01:53.714
[crashing noise]

01:53.747 --> 01:54.715
Oh!

01:54.748 --> 01:55.849
Oh!

01:55.883 --> 01:57.951
Sounds like that seven
pin's still standing.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.387
I can't see anything.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.354
Oh, Meg!

02:00.388 --> 02:01.355
What happened?

02:01.389 --> 02:03.056
Oh, Crystal, I can't talk now.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.392
Oh, oh, this is trouble.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.196
Liz?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.397
Liz!

02:09.430 --> 02:10.798
It's Meg.

02:10.831 --> 02:14.001
I've had an accident, and I'm
going to have to miss the game.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.670
Well, I've got to take Jacques
straight to the hospital.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.773
He seems shaken.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.074
What?

02:21.108 --> 02:23.711
Oh, I rear-ended
that shampoo girl.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.678
R--Roseanne!

02:24.712 --> 02:27.515
[music playing]

02:31.018 --> 02:33.721
Now, everything's
going to be just fine.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.825
Your mom wasn't hurt and
neither was Mrs. Wellman.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.394
That's what your dad told me,
and I know that your father

02:40.428 --> 02:42.330
wouldn't lie to me.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.631
You know, I don't
believe in sparing

02:43.664 --> 02:45.499
people the truth, especially
not when she's my sister,

02:45.533 --> 02:46.900
but I just--

02:46.934 --> 02:48.536
I don't think that your father
would do something like that,

02:48.569 --> 02:49.870
you know?
Becky?

02:49.903 --> 02:51.239
What?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.873
I don't think that your father
would keep anything from me,

02:52.906 --> 02:53.774
do you?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.376
Aunt Jackie, just relax, OK?

02:55.409 --> 02:56.277
Yeah.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.479
Mom's not dead.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.315
No, she's not
dead, of course not.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.550
No, everything's fine.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
Huh?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.486
Everything's fine,
just like what we said.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.787
Everything's just fine.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.688
[door opening]

03:07.721 --> 03:08.522
They're home!

03:11.792 --> 03:12.826
Oh, my God.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.794
Roseanne?

03:13.827 --> 03:14.628
She's a little spacey.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.300
Mom, that neck thing's neat.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.268
Can I have it?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.870
[giggling]

03:23.871 --> 03:25.172
How's Meg again?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.774
Meg's fine.

03:26.807 --> 03:27.975
Hmm.

03:28.008 --> 03:28.809
Wa-boom.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.914
God, she's blasted!

03:33.947 --> 03:35.683
They got her on
muscle relaxers.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.617
She'll sleep it off.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.719
I'm gonna turn down the bed.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.187
Look at this!

03:40.220 --> 03:43.056
[giggling]

03:47.027 --> 03:49.497
Oh, this room's nice.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.198
It needs to be cleaned up.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.032
Mmm!

03:58.472 --> 04:00.774
Oh, no, no, Roseanne.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.142
No, we don't do that.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.277
No, no.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.313
She's really out of it.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.348
Mom, you didn't fly through
the windshield or anything,

04:07.381 --> 04:08.416
did you?

04:08.449 --> 04:11.319
No, but I'd like
to try that sometime.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.153
She had her seat belt on.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.789
I'll get it.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.757
Oh, well.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.725
Hello?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.827
Ah, they said
they'd call back.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.732
I think the station
wagon may be totaled.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.633
Yes!

04:25.666 --> 04:26.534
Finally!

04:26.567 --> 04:29.036
Yeah!

04:29.069 --> 04:31.004
I hope you know
a good attorney.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.105
I know an attorney.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.240
Good.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.743
And I want to see a copy
of that accident report.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.245
[laughter]

04:38.278 --> 04:39.212
DAN: Come on, honey.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.614
No!
No--

04:40.648 --> 04:41.782
Oh, get Chi-Chi!

04:41.815 --> 04:42.683
No!

04:42.716 --> 04:44.385
No, no, no!

04:44.418 --> 04:48.722
Well, I hope that we have
all learned a very, very

04:48.756 --> 04:51.224
important lesson here today.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.460
What?

04:52.493 --> 04:57.965
That is exactly the reason
why we always wear our--

04:57.998 --> 05:00.768
ALL: Seat belts.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.204
You know, cops got a saying.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.140
You never pull a dead
man out of a seat belt.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.676
What, do you just
leave him there?

05:14.748 --> 05:15.616
Some cops do.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.551
I don't.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.754
[music playing]

05:22.255 --> 05:24.525
Now, Mom, I don't want
you to move or anything, OK?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.494
Just tell me how to work
your sewing machine.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.395
What are you sewing?

05:27.428 --> 05:28.496
Just a hem.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.163
Uh, OK.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.331
You know the power switch?

05:31.365 --> 05:32.232
Yeah?

05:32.265 --> 05:34.535
Turn it off.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.904
Put it back in the case and
then bring your mother a needle

05:36.937 --> 05:38.472
and a thread and she'll do it.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.708
Great.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.943
Mom, do you want anything
from the drugstore?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.277
ROSEANNE: Yeah.

05:44.311 --> 05:47.648
Bring me back a "Woman's World"
and a big bag of Cheetos.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.417
DJ: Bring me something!

05:49.450 --> 05:50.851
I'm gonna need money.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.853
ROSEANNE: Well,
go find my purse.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.854
Oh, look, here it is.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.660
Uh, this five's good.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.462
Yeah, I want you to
bring me back change.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.362
Bye!

06:02.396 --> 06:03.797
Keeping your mommy company?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.198
We're reading.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.867
Why don't you take a walk with
Darlene down to the drugstore?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.135
I'm broke.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.036
Darlene's got bread.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.037
I just gave her $5.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
Got you some lunch.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.945
I don't feel like
eating right now, honey.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.447
Where'd you get them flowers?

06:19.480 --> 06:23.417
Oh, the girls at the
beauty shop had them sent by.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.885
Oh, that was nice.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.386
Yeah.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.556
How are you feeling?

06:28.589 --> 06:31.058
- How do I look?
- How are you feeling?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.630
I finally get some
time off from work,

06:36.664 --> 06:38.265
and I can't do a damn thing.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.400
The kids are in there
eating canned spaghetti.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.902
Hey, they like
canned spaghetti.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.071
Well, not for breakfast.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.372
Nah, don't you worry about it.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.307
You just worry about
getting yourself better.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.275
I can't!

06:48.308 --> 06:49.543
I got too much
other stuff to worry

06:49.577 --> 06:51.144
about, like bills
and the mortgage

06:51.178 --> 06:52.546
and all that kind of stuff.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.583
And what if I miss another week
off of work or another month?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.085
You know, I can lose my job.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.119
OK, Tallulah.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.455
Drama hour's over.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.224
You know what bugs me the
worst with this whole thing?

07:04.257 --> 07:07.227
That old cow Mrs. Wellman can't
even call to see if I'm OK.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.361
Yeah?

07:08.395 --> 07:11.064
Well, we're going to hit
Bossy where it hurts.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.133
Remember Peter
Lundy, the attorney?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.201
He's an attorney?

07:14.234 --> 07:15.402
Of course he's an attorney.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.770
Heh.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.839
Does he have any clients?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.007
Yep.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.342
ALL: Us.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.911
Yeah, I got him on retainer.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.714
Oh, you got him on retainer?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.616
Well, he stiffed me on
a driveway job last year.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.283
Anyway, he's coming
by tomorrow night.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.451
ROSEANNE: For what?

07:31.485 --> 07:33.286
Well, I told
him you were hurt,

07:33.320 --> 07:35.856
and he said if the injury
was serious enough,

07:35.889 --> 07:38.526
a lawsuit may be
worth talking about.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.560
A lawsuit?

07:39.593 --> 07:40.628
Yeah.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.262
You want to get Meg
Wellman, don't you?

07:42.295 --> 07:46.867
Well, yeah, of course, but
I mean, I ain't hurt that bad.

07:46.900 --> 07:51.004
I'm just-- you know, I'm
just a little stiff, is all.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.773
Oh, God!

07:52.806 --> 07:53.674
Honey.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.575
Help me!

07:54.608 --> 07:55.509
Honey, honey, honey.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.977
[groaning]
- Oh, it hurts.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.278
It hurts!
It hurts!

07:58.311 --> 07:59.547
It hurts!
It hurts!

07:59.580 --> 08:00.514
Ow, ow, ow!

08:00.548 --> 08:01.515
You all right?

08:01.549 --> 08:03.984
Oh, it hurts!

08:04.017 --> 08:05.753
Think you could
do that in court?

08:05.786 --> 08:08.756
[music playing]

08:11.258 --> 08:12.192
Honey?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.261
You remember Peter Lundy?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.162
Uh, yeah.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.597
Hi, Peter.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.231
How's the law
business treating you?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.232
Oh, it's good, Roseanne.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.500
It's good.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.136
I'm, uh, I'm sorry to hear
about your little mishap.

08:23.170 --> 08:27.641
So tell us how we can
own the Wellman ranch.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.009
You could, uh-- let's see.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.912
We-- we can make an offer and
see if she wants to sell it.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.647
Ha!

08:33.681 --> 08:36.383
Probably not what
you meant, huh?

08:36.416 --> 08:40.387
My husband is interested
in a lawsuit, you know, if--

08:40.420 --> 08:42.623
if you think that's
the thing we should do.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.058
Well, like I said
over the phone, I'd be--

08:45.092 --> 08:47.961
I'd be happy to give whatever
advice I can, maybe even write

08:47.995 --> 08:50.931
a threatening letter, though
the last one of those I wrote,

08:50.964 --> 08:54.101
I nearly got sued.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.736
Well, that's encouraging.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.339
You know, if, uh, this thing
gets to where you actually, uh,

08:59.372 --> 09:03.844
want to file suit,
I'd like to, uh--

09:03.877 --> 09:07.615
I'd like to recommend another
attorney, one that specializes

09:07.648 --> 09:10.317
in, uh, personal injury actions.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.819
You don't think
you can handle this?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.020
Oh, trust me.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.790
I'm-- I'm not your guy,
especially, uh, especially

09:16.824 --> 09:17.991
if it means going to court.

09:18.025 --> 09:18.992
Whew.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.594
Not-- not-- not--
not good in court.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.203
Well, are you any
good at referrals?

09:30.237 --> 09:33.173
Oh, best in the business.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.509
Yeah, if, uh, I recommend
another lawyer to you,

09:36.543 --> 09:38.311
you'll do great.

09:38.345 --> 09:42.249
If I handle it, nope.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.417
Well, we appreciate
your honesty.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.087
Yeah, well, hopefully
this lady's counsel will

09:47.120 --> 09:48.188
get her to settle out of court.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.256
Save us a lot of time and money.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.157
Well, yeah?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.659
You think we can do that?

09:51.692 --> 09:56.329
Oh, probably not, but, uh,
well, we can give it a try.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.832
Uh, would it be
unethical for us to refer

09:58.866 --> 10:02.302
him to represent Mrs. Wellman?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.203
Yes.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.705
Let me, uh--

10:04.738 --> 10:07.374
let me just go over a few
things with you, Mrs. Conner,

10:07.407 --> 10:10.177
make sure I got
everything straight.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.278
I just need a--

10:11.311 --> 10:13.080
need a-- need to
take a few notes.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.684
Do you, uh-- do you have a pen?

10:16.717 --> 10:20.053
Uh, yeah.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.956
[dishes rattling]

10:22.990 --> 10:24.825
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.694
Eureka.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.997
Found it.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.932
First of all, if,
uh, you're going

10:31.965 --> 10:36.036
to be involved in a personal
injury type of situation,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.706
you can't keep taking
that neck brace off.

10:38.739 --> 10:43.176
No, you have to stay in bed,
suspend normal activity,

10:43.210 --> 10:48.381
and uh, you know, don't drive
'cause one good jolt, and bop!

10:48.415 --> 10:50.984
There goes mister spine.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.721
[music playing]

10:55.689 --> 10:59.126
So Your Honor, how much actual
cash do you think we'll see out

10:59.159 --> 11:01.795
of this if we sue Mrs. Wellman?

11:01.829 --> 11:03.697
Well, uh, let's see.

11:03.731 --> 11:07.400
That's-- that's if we actually
sue Mrs. Wellman and win.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.301
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.602
Assuming we win.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.371
PETER: Oh, well, then you
could be entitled to as much

11:11.404 --> 11:14.341
as, say, oh, three times
the medical bills and,

11:14.374 --> 11:16.043
uh, the lost income.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.310
I'll see ya.
- Yeah.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.211
Thanks for stopping by.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.313
Uh-huh.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.214
BECKY: Three times?

11:21.248 --> 11:22.783
This is great!

11:22.816 --> 11:25.052
So look, if the doctor bill
was like, $500, we'd get--

11:25.085 --> 11:27.921
$14,000-- We'd get $3,000--

11:27.955 --> 11:30.290
[interposing voices]

11:30.323 --> 11:31.759
We'd get like, a
million, billion dollars!

11:31.792 --> 11:35.562
We'd get $3 million
billion jillion!

11:35.595 --> 11:37.297
Dad, we have to
buy a new house.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.967
We got to clean
this one first.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.269
They're building some real
nice ones around Elm Ridge.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.271
Yeah, we can get a cleaning
lady to come in a couple times

11:44.304 --> 11:45.672
a week.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.574
We're not buying a new house,
and we're not getting a maid.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.408
Well, how about a VCR?

11:50.443 --> 11:51.311
Maybe.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.212
Yes!

11:52.245 --> 11:53.413
We're getting the tape--

11:53.446 --> 11:56.183
[music playing]

11:56.216 --> 11:58.585
DEBBIE: Mrs. Wellman
said she was running late

11:58.618 --> 12:00.988
and was in a hurry.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.522
So she could
have been speeding

12:02.555 --> 12:04.958
or possibly
distracted because she

12:04.992 --> 12:06.093
was thinking of something else.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.227
Thank you, ma'am.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.695
Know that the department
appreciates the help.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.801
So now Jackie, excuse
me for interfering,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.335
but is this really
police business?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.805
Or is this personal
because it's your sister?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.874
This is police business,
Crystal, that happens

12:20.908 --> 12:23.543
to affect me personally.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.979
So, uh, Roseanne
decided to sue Meg.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.816
I am not at liberty
to discuss that.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.983
Oh, come on, Jackie.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.352
Don't play cop with me.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.455
You know, Crystal, if I wanted
to, I could give you a summons.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.790
What?

12:36.824 --> 12:40.727
You know, if I wanted to, I
could give you a makeover.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.628
Why?

12:41.661 --> 12:43.230
You think I need a makeover?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.899
Well, I think you could
use some new colors.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.968
You know, I got a new blue
that would look great--

12:48.001 --> 12:49.602
Hi, Meg.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.872
MEG: Oh, what's going on here?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.573
You weren't robbed, were you?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.375
Are you Margaret Wellman?

12:55.408 --> 12:56.343
Yes.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.477
Yes, I am.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.914
You were involved in
an automobile accident

13:00.948 --> 13:03.984
in the number two
lane of Palmer Avenue

13:04.017 --> 13:08.255
at approximately 2:48 PM
last Tuesday, in which you,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.524
as the driver of a 1987
El Dorado Cadillac,

13:11.558 --> 13:14.727
slammed into the rear end
of a 1974 station wagon

13:14.761 --> 13:17.664
of one Roseanne Harris Conner.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.565
Yes.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.833
Yes, I did.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.903
Say, didn't you
used to work for me?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.204
Yes, I did.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.739
And if it's all right, I'll
ask the questions, ma'am.

13:26.773 --> 13:29.009
You're Roxanne's
sister, aren't you?

13:29.042 --> 13:29.843
Janet.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.947
It's Jackie.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.484
Oh, actually, he's called
Jacques, but a lot of people

13:37.517 --> 13:40.120
mispronounce it.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.991
You know what's real easy
to pronounce, Mrs. Wellman?

13:44.024 --> 13:48.828
Cop, because that's
what I am-- cop.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.563
And I'm here
investigating an accident

13:50.597 --> 13:51.564
in which a person was injured.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.632
Does this dog have a license?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.700
[dog growling]

13:53.733 --> 13:56.103
And said person is
still at home, in bed,

13:56.136 --> 13:57.905
unable to support
her family, barely

13:57.938 --> 13:59.306
able to talk to her lawyers.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.840
Roxanne called an attorney.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.443
You bet she called an
attorney, a good one,

14:03.476 --> 14:07.347
with offices in big cities.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.281
Jackie.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.984
Talking about a
big lawsuit here.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.485
Lawsuit?

14:12.519 --> 14:15.255
Well, I guess I'd
better call my attorney.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.656
You better call
somebody, lady.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.925
You're not getting
away with this one.

14:17.958 --> 14:18.892
I've checked the records.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.393
You've had some
pretty busy bumpers.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.294
Come on, Jackie.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.262
[dog barking]

14:22.295 --> 14:25.132
Come on.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.867
MEG: I didn't know
Roxanne was still at home.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.770
She hasn't been in
for the whole week.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.072
Well, my attorney
didn't tell me

14:32.105 --> 14:34.174
she was so seriously injured.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.809
Well, did you even call
her up and see how she was?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.546
Well, my attorney
advised me not to.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.414
He said it would be
an admission of guilt.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.516
Well, you are guilty, Meg!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.285
You smashed her car!

14:45.318 --> 14:49.322
And you gotta take
responsibility for that.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.757
Remember one thing, Wellman--

14:50.790 --> 14:54.594
I'm your worst nightmare.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.497
[music playing]

15:01.534 --> 15:05.538
Mom, there's a
Cadillac in our driveway.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.374
What color Cadillac?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.342
Uh, ear wax gold.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.947
And the front
end is smashed in.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.683
Holy cow, it's Mrs. Wellman.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.018
DJ, give me that neck brace.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.119
Quick!

15:19.152 --> 15:20.954
Oh, I knew she'd show
up sooner or later.

15:20.988 --> 15:21.989
No, Mom, you're a vegetable.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.323
Ow, ow, ow!

15:23.356 --> 15:26.126
Here, put this on.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.460
Now, she's coming
by to see me.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.962
I'm sure she feels bad enough.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.863
You always say how you
want better things for us.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.799
Yeah, but I was talking
about me and your dad.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.135
You kids already
got it too good.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.036
[doorbell ringing]

15:36.069 --> 15:37.304
Mom, make your arm limp!

15:37.337 --> 15:38.571
Make your arm limp!

15:38.605 --> 15:40.107
You know what's good?
Talk with water in your mouth!

15:40.140 --> 15:41.008
[doorbell ringing]

15:41.041 --> 15:42.042
- Do I have to get--
- No!

15:42.075 --> 15:42.942
Mom, sit down!

15:42.976 --> 15:44.444
DJ, get the door.
- Sick.

15:44.477 --> 15:44.877
Sick.

15:44.911 --> 15:45.745
Sick.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.381
Remember, Mom,
you're broccoli.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.282
Hello.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.684
Oh, hello, little man.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.986
Is your mommy home?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.021
Hi, Meg.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.322
Oh.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.258
The doctor says she really
shouldn't have visitors.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.928
Yeah, especially young ones.

16:01.961 --> 16:02.929
You guys go play.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.572
[door shutting]

16:12.605 --> 16:16.643
Well, I guess Jacques doesn't
get to play much 9 ball.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.644
[chuckling]

16:17.677 --> 16:20.347
Oh, Roxanne, you
do make me laugh.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.415
Have a seat.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.252
Well, thank you, Roxanne.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.320
I brought you some treats.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.190
Oh, well, that was very nice.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.125
Uh, by the way,
I'm glad you didn't

16:32.159 --> 16:33.393
get racked up or nothing.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.995
Oh, I'm fine.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.666
Well, it was very nice
of you to, uh, stop by.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.301
Don't be silly.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.636
We were in the neighborhood.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.837
What, were you
getting an estimate

16:44.871 --> 16:46.973
on body damage or something?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.808
Actually, yes.

16:48.841 --> 16:53.280
Roxanne, I didn't know you were
so seriously injured until I

16:53.313 --> 16:55.782
spoke to Janet at the salon.

16:55.815 --> 16:56.716
Janet?

16:56.749 --> 16:59.319
Your sister.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.687
Oh.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.855
Well, no offense,
Meg, but you know,

17:02.889 --> 17:05.458
if you would have called
me, I could have told

17:05.492 --> 17:07.294
you that I was seriously hurt.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.696
Well, I would have
called, Roxanne,

17:09.729 --> 17:12.199
but my attorney
advised me not to.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.934
Well, how very legal of you.

17:14.967 --> 17:18.571
Roxanne, I want you to know
that even though you no longer

17:18.605 --> 17:20.873
work for the company,
we still think of you

17:20.907 --> 17:23.410
as part of the Wellman family.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.379
I don't suppose my health
insurance is still good.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.182
[chuckling]

17:30.283 --> 17:32.152
You-- you just
stopped by because you

17:32.185 --> 17:33.653
were in the neighborhood.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.122
Well, yes.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.257
And because you wanted
to see how I was doing

17:37.290 --> 17:39.426
and to bring me a gift?

17:39.459 --> 17:42.028
Oh, it's nothing.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.864
Yes, it is.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.634
It's very nice of
you to come by.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.539
Well, actually, there was just
one other, teensy little thing,

17:52.572 --> 17:53.973
just while I'm here.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.775
Uh, you need a shampoo.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.045
Oh, nothing that complicated.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.116
No, I wanted you to
endorse this check.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.050
A check?

18:04.083 --> 18:04.951
For what?

18:04.984 --> 18:08.288
For you, Roxanne, and--

18:08.321 --> 18:10.590
and for your little family.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.926
Uh, honey?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.328
I don't know what to say.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.397
MEG: Well, now, if
you just sign that,

18:17.430 --> 18:19.866
Jacques and I will run it
right over to your bank,

18:19.899 --> 18:21.568
and you will have your money.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.071
Uh, Meg, I'm sure you
know my husband, Don.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.973
Trust me.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.541
Oh, of course.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.709
It's nice to see you, Dan.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.014
Pleasure, Mrs. Wellman.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.048
Could I fix you a drink?

18:36.082 --> 18:37.450
Oh, no, I'll
only stay a moment.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.886
And you must call me Meg.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.188
Right now?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.021
Meg?

18:45.192 --> 18:47.294
Meg, why are you
giving us all this money?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.361
Why?

18:48.395 --> 18:51.564
Well, because it's
the right thing to do,

18:51.598 --> 18:53.200
and I'm a nice person.

18:53.233 --> 18:57.103
But what is this
little tiny writing here?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.071
Endorsement
constitutes acceptance

18:59.105 --> 19:00.873
of payment for total liability.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.810
Oh, that's just a bunch
of legal mumbo jumbo.

19:03.843 --> 19:04.944
Yeah.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.046
We wouldn't want to get
legal, now, would we?

19:07.079 --> 19:08.080
Oh, of course not.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.449
No, of course not,
'cause our lawyer

19:09.482 --> 19:12.685
tells us we can get three
or four times that amount.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.655
People get so
silly about money.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.590
Here.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.159
Thanks for dropping by, Meg,
and making me feel stupid.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.128
Roseanne, she's our guest.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.297
Now, why would
you feel stupid?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.999
Because for some
dumb reason, I actually

19:27.033 --> 19:29.001
thought that you dropped
by to see how I was doing,

19:29.035 --> 19:31.070
but you only came
by to buy me off.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.339
Buy you off?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.274
Yeah, but you bought
yourself a huge lawsuit, lady,

19:34.307 --> 19:35.642
because I'm going to
haul you into court,

19:35.675 --> 19:36.876
and I'm going to
squeeze you dry.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.982
Well, I hope you have
a very good attorney.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.002
Let me rephrase that, Meg.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.405
Um, I think what I
really meant to say

20:05.438 --> 20:07.374
was that if, uh-- you know,
if I-- if I would have

20:07.407 --> 20:09.409
bumped into you, I mean, I
would have called a lawyer too,

20:09.442 --> 20:10.810
you know?

20:10.843 --> 20:12.412
But first, I would have maybe
called you to see if you were

20:12.445 --> 20:15.548
OK and-- and to say I'm sorry.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.817
But I am sorry, Roxanne.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.852
There you go.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.821
Well, that's all
I needed to hear.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.290
That's all you want?

20:23.323 --> 20:24.457
That, and your
word that I never

20:24.491 --> 20:25.792
have to walk your dog again.

20:25.825 --> 20:26.726
[dog growling]

20:26.759 --> 20:28.060
And that's it?

20:28.094 --> 20:30.697
And the check.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.531
Of course.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.471
Oh, Don?

20:38.505 --> 20:40.740
Could you walk me to my car?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.074
Of course.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.009
Neighborhood.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.849
Roxanne, I am so glad
we got this straightened

20:49.882 --> 20:51.618
out just between us.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.953
And we are friends
again, aren't we?

20:53.986 --> 20:58.224
Oh, I'd say we're about as
close as we ever were, Meg.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.130
[music playing]

21:06.198 --> 21:09.068
My lawyer got me $25,000.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.837
Got me $25,000.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.505
Got me $60,000.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.840
Took care of
everything for me.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.942
He got me a $20,000 settlement.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.644
[car crashing]

21:17.677 --> 21:24.351
I broke my leg, and Larry
Parker got me $80,000.

21:24.384 --> 21:29.088
After the accident, my car
got fixed, my medical was paid,

21:29.121 --> 21:30.423
and I got a good settlement.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.358
I was in a crosswalk.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.892
I got hit by a car.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.927
I got my knee and
my back messed up.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.496
I went through the
windshield of a car.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.897
I shattered my wrist.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.633
So I went to Larry H. Parker,
and they got me some big money.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.636
[car crashing]
