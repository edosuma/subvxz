<i>They say loss is
the real measure of love.</i>

00:24.166 --> 00:27.580
<i>This story took place
during a bit of April,</i>

00:27.666 --> 00:31.000
<i>a tad of May
and all through September.</i>

00:31.333 --> 00:36.374
<i>For a fistful of kisses,</i>

00:36.500 --> 00:42.326
<i>I went out of my mind one day.</i>

00:42.500 --> 00:46.995
<i>For a fistful of kisses,</i>

00:47.083 --> 00:53.159
<i>I found my downfall.</i>

00:53.583 --> 00:58.157
<i>For a fistful of kisses,</i>

00:58.250 --> 01:04.247
<i>I experienced betrayal.</i>

01:04.333 --> 01:09.579
<i>I just have memories left now.</i>

01:10.125 --> 01:15.075
<i>For a fistful of kisses,</i>

01:15.166 --> 01:21.083
<i>I don't talk about love anymore.</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:28.825
<i>Every time I try to forget</i>

01:32.333 --> 01:37.328
<i>I get drunk
and regret everything.</i>

01:37.833 --> 01:43.579
<i>Every time I try to forget,</i>

01:46.250 --> 01:51.325
<i>I get drunk
and regret everything.</i>

01:51.666 --> 01:55.740
<i>I wasn't able to forget him</i>

01:55.833 --> 01:58.746
<i>and he comes back to me,</i>

01:58.833 --> 02:02.747
<i>and he comes back here.</i>

02:02.833 --> 02:06.747
<i>I loved no one else since then.</i>

02:06.833 --> 02:13.250
<i>No one else.</i>

02:32.916 --> 02:37.035
FOR A FISTFUL OF KISSES

02:40.500 --> 02:44.244
A BIT OF APRIL...

02:57.833 --> 03:03.329
<i>The sun rises again. Yesterday,
your heart went to bed feeling down,</i>

03:03.416 --> 03:06.659
<i>but, today, you woke up</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:10.744
<i>and that's what matters now.</i>

03:10.916 --> 03:16.412
<i>Fear, anxiety, ghosts of the past
and ghosts of reason.</i>

03:16.500 --> 03:19.743
<i>Your giants' fight,</i>

03:19.833 --> 03:23.907
<i>your Art Histories.</i>

03:24.083 --> 03:30.489
<i>As long as I have any voice left,
I will keep on singing for you.</i>

03:30.666 --> 03:33.579
<i>As long as I have
any voice left...</i>

03:34.000 --> 03:38.165
THINGS I WILL DO
WITH HIM

03:38.166 --> 03:39.577
<i>As long as I have
any blood left.</i>

03:39.583 --> 03:41.324
<i>How are you today?</i>

03:41.416 --> 03:46.081
<i>There's a nice view of the sea
from the window of your big city.</i>

03:46.166 --> 03:49.330
<i>Looking for a flower
to stop and have a rest.</i>

03:49.416 --> 03:55.413
<i>Even if we don't play together,
if you drown one day, I'll rescue you.</i>

03:56.000 --> 03:59.914
<i>I'll rescue you.</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:15.579
<i>I know that your heart
has put and ad on TV.</i>

04:15.666 --> 04:18.829
<i>You're not asking
that much after all.</i>

04:18.916 --> 04:24.742
<i>Just an ordinary guy who would
take you by the hand and say "yes",</i>

04:25.166 --> 04:28.830
<i>who would go with you
to see that exhibition</i>

04:28.916 --> 04:32.080
<i>in your imagination,</i>

04:32.166 --> 04:33.998
<i>who would enjoy...</i>

04:34.125 --> 04:35.832
Dani?

04:36.208 --> 04:38.074
<i>- Yes?</i>
- I'm Sol.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.994
- May I sit down?
- Yes, sure. Sorry.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.907
What would you like to have?

04:52.916 --> 04:54.657
One beer, please.

04:59.541 --> 05:01.407
Do I look like you expected?

05:01.583 --> 05:04.246
That's not really important,
don't you think?

05:04.333 --> 05:06.325
Yes, it is.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.825
I don't know, I think...

05:10.416 --> 05:12.032
Thanks.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.829
I think your letter was the key.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.665
- It was beautiful.
- Thanks.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.413
- You're a good writer.
- It comes easy to me.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.243
- Have you written something?
- Just as a hobby.

05:24.333 --> 05:28.327
- I'd like to read it. I mean if you...
- Yeah, sure.

05:30.916 --> 05:32.828
Listen...

05:33.083 --> 05:35.905
This is new for me.
I don't even know if...

05:37.250 --> 05:39.833
Well, I do know...

05:39.875 --> 05:42.162
- But I don't want to rush into things.
- Me neither.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.742
- This is important.
- I know.

05:46.416 --> 05:48.499
Do you know why I chose you?

05:49.250 --> 05:51.663
In your letter, you said that...

05:51.916 --> 05:55.000
time is just our way
of spending our life.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.158
And why did you write me?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.574
I'm not totally sure yet, to be honest,
but your ad was revealing.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.826
I don't mean to sound rude,
but may I see a certificate

06:17.916 --> 06:19.999
- or something?
- Yes, yes.

06:33.666 --> 06:36.249
- I brought mine too.
- It's not necessary.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.245
Read it, please.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.832
Shall we go for a walk?

07:02.833 --> 07:05.746
- Do you live downtown?
- No, I don't.

07:06.666 --> 07:10.410
- We could have met somewhere else.
- Don't worry.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.743
- Do you feel like something sweet? Hurry!
- Not now...

07:17.750 --> 07:19.412
<i>Come on!</i>

07:27.833 --> 07:29.745
<i>Defining Sol?</i>

07:30.333 --> 07:31.915
<i>That's impossible.</i>

07:32.416 --> 07:34.408
<i>I don't know...</i>

07:34.500 --> 07:38.073
What does she like?
She likes...

07:38.166 --> 07:40.499
walking by the sea,

07:40.583 --> 07:43.576
Saturday nights
and taking photos.

07:43.666 --> 07:46.409
"Life bites", as she calls them.

07:46.750 --> 07:51.074
She also likes songs with a story,
peach jam...

07:51.166 --> 07:56.082
She hates waking up early,
gray days, arguing for no reason

07:56.416 --> 07:58.908
and lies in all their forms.

07:59.166 --> 08:03.991
But, above all, she loves dusting with
confectioners' sugar her high moments.

08:51.750 --> 08:54.993
So this is it.
This is where I live.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.322
- OK.
- I had a great time.

08:59.791 --> 09:03.375
We could have a second date,
to get to know each other better.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.789
And, if it goes well, another one.
What do you say?

09:06.833 --> 09:08.415
Fine.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.325
Dani, don't think
there's someone else.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.163
- It doesn't matter.
- There isn't.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.241
Bye.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.657
Bye.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.870
<i>Hi, Sol.</i>

10:02.000 --> 10:04.583
<i>In real life,
love is a dream for two people,</i>

10:04.666 --> 10:08.410
<i>where very often one dreams while
the other one lets themselves be dreamed.</i>

10:08.750 --> 10:13.495
<i>For those who love, time is an eternity,
it's just their way of spending life.</i>

10:15.833 --> 10:19.406
<i>We, on the other hand,
will dream and let ourselves be dreamed</i>

10:19.500 --> 10:22.322
<i>at the same time, together.</i>

10:22.750 --> 10:25.663
<i>Even if you don't choose me,
I'd like to meet you.</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:28.413
<i>We could create a bubble
and live inside it.</i>

10:28.666 --> 10:31.454
<i>And, of course,
forgetting about shrinks.</i>

10:31.666 --> 10:33.407
<i>Dani.</i>

10:45.833 --> 10:49.326
DON'T HATE
THE ONE YOU LOVED

11:46.166 --> 11:48.078
Spit it out!

11:51.250 --> 11:53.742
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

11:53.833 --> 11:55.574
- What?
- Is that all?

11:55.666 --> 11:59.330
We talked to get to know
each other a bit, and that's it.

11:59.916 --> 12:02.829
Alright.
What's his job?

12:02.916 --> 12:05.329
- I don't know.
- You didn't ask him?

12:05.416 --> 12:10.161
No. Well, I don't want to go too fast
and overwhelm him.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.906
We talked to get to know
each other a bit, and that's it.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.822
That's all.
He's like me.

12:17.916 --> 12:21.330
Yeah, but it was him who answered your ad,
and not the other way around.

12:21.416 --> 12:25.581
- He didn't look like a serial killer.
- Right, they never do.

12:25.666 --> 12:30.240
- Did he at least prove that...?
- Yes. I saw his medical certificate.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.165
Describe him.

12:35.666 --> 12:39.489
He's attractive.
Very attractive.

12:39.750 --> 12:44.666
He likes the same songs I like.
He's an awesome writer.

12:46.416 --> 12:50.080
<i>I don't know, he has this mixture
of shyness and mystery.</i>

12:50.166 --> 12:52.909
And he walks too fast!
I can't keep up with him!

12:53.000 --> 12:55.413
Well, that makes two of us.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.664
<i>He has these deep green eyes.</i>

12:58.833 --> 13:02.247
<i>And he has these beautiful lips
and an open smile.</i>

13:02.333 --> 13:05.246
<i>He has these strong big hands.</i>

13:05.666 --> 13:10.491
<i>I don't know... It went well.
That's all I can say so far.</i>

13:10.583 --> 13:13.326
So you're taking the chance.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.499
It was just about time,
don't you think?

13:17.666 --> 13:20.659
<i>It's been a long time
since I last got close to a guy.</i>

13:24.833 --> 13:26.916
You're a bastard.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.662
What's up, neighbor?

13:33.583 --> 13:36.166
I can't get these slices in!

13:36.250 --> 13:39.994
That's the problem of online shopping.
You don't get to see the product, so...

13:40.083 --> 13:43.747
- Who'd have thought they'd be so thick?
- Let me try. May I?

13:43.833 --> 13:45.665
Yes, here.

13:47.833 --> 13:49.916
Why are you so nervous?

13:50.250 --> 13:54.324
- I'm late to work. I have so much to do.
- Relax, you're gonna have a heart attack.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.659
You know?
I washed my teeth with a face mask!

13:58.833 --> 14:02.747
- All the tubes look the same.
- Your teeth must be moisturized now.

14:02.833 --> 14:05.166
- Hey, this is impossible.
- Yeah.

14:05.416 --> 14:08.659
So tell me.
How was your date?

14:08.750 --> 14:13.245
Fine. We talked a bit
and agreed to meet again, that's all.

14:13.916 --> 14:19.241
- Describe her.
- 1,65 m tall. Beautiful lips and eyes.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.666
- An angelic face.
- Age?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.745
She's 21.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.656
- Shit, Dani.
- Did you expect her to be 30 or 40?

14:27.750 --> 14:32.825
The ad talked about "rebuilding her life".
That involves having a past.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.163
- Well, you see.
- So you're going on?

14:36.250 --> 14:38.492
I'm thinking about it, yes.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.495
- Don't tell me you liked her.
- Yes, she's gorgeous. But...

14:43.583 --> 14:46.496
As usual, you meet a girl
and your brain just turns upside down.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.405
- Come on, Lidia, I'm not that crazy.
- Yes, you are.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.243
And the worst thing is you drag
everyone else into your madness.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.576
Nothing will happen.
We agreed to meet again.

14:55.666 --> 14:58.750
Next time I see her, I'll tell her
or I'll break up with her. I don't know.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.166
Yeah, "I don't know".
I do know.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.155
You're gonna mess up.
We're off!

15:08.500 --> 15:09.991
Just one thing.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.996
- Is she OK or...?
- Yes, she's fine.

15:14.916 --> 15:16.407
What about you?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.996
- Did she like you?
- I think she did.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.993
- Well, that's dynamite!
- But it'll burst on me, don't worry.

15:23.083 --> 15:26.747
- You're wrong. It'll burst on her.
- I won't tell you anything else.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.905
- And don't tell Sandro.
- Dani, listen to me.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.993
Mamen left, it's over.
You can go out with someone else asap,

15:33.083 --> 15:36.656
but don't play the romantic hero
or look for a substitute.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.497
- Or mix work with love.
- I won't!

15:46.583 --> 15:48.825
Runner <i>magazine, hello!</i>

15:49.750 --> 15:52.493
<i>If you're calling
about the front page, yes...</i>

15:59.833 --> 16:01.495
<i>Dani!</i>

16:03.500 --> 16:05.583
Your cellphone just rang.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.415
Thanks.

16:31.916 --> 16:33.828
Hi, Dani!

16:34.250 --> 16:37.823
<i>- How are you?</i>
- I'm fine. You got ahead of me.

16:37.916 --> 16:41.080
<i>Yes. Tonight I'm having
dinner at my parents' house.</i>

16:41.166 --> 16:45.740
They don't know, so I didn't want you
to call me while I was there.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.324
<i>Sure.</i>

16:48.333 --> 16:50.074
How are you?

16:50.416 --> 16:52.078
I'm fine.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.747
- A bit surprised, to be honest.
<i>- Me too.</i>

16:56.500 --> 17:00.323
I wasn't sure
if you'd want to...

17:01.666 --> 17:03.498
- Go on?
<i>- Yes.</i>

17:03.833 --> 17:05.415
Why not?

17:06.500 --> 17:09.321
<i>- Are you still there?</i>
- Yes, sorry.

17:09.665 --> 17:13.910
<i>- What is it? You're not sure, right?</i>
- Yes, I want to see you again.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.744
I want to see you too.

17:15.833 --> 17:18.165
<i>So when are we meeting up?</i>

17:18.915 --> 17:20.999
Tomorrow.

17:21.750 --> 17:27.656
I can't. Why don't we meet next Saturday
and spend all day together?

17:27.750 --> 17:31.915
Next Saturday then. Will you pick me up
where we met the other day?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.743
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Great.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.743
- Dani, can I ask you a question now?
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

17:39.833 --> 17:41.665
What's your job?

17:43.333 --> 17:45.325
I'm a web designer.

17:45.583 --> 17:49.873
<i>- Well, that's interesting.</i>
- I've got to go now, OK?

17:49.916 --> 17:51.999
OK. OK.

17:52.083 --> 17:54.746
- Bye. Take care.
<i>- You too.</i>

17:54.833 --> 17:56.495
Bye.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.743
Dani!
Sorry I'm late!

18:20.833 --> 18:22.574
It's OK.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.245
- So?
- You look beautiful.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.120
Really?

18:28.916 --> 18:30.578
What do you want to do?

18:30.666 --> 18:33.329
- Shall we walk and...?
- OK.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.993
<i>- What are you thinking about?
- You said your parents didn't know.</i>

18:42.083 --> 18:44.996
<i>No. When I found out,
I left home.</i>

18:45.083 --> 18:48.497
<i>To live with Gloria.
She's an awesome friend.</i>

18:48.583 --> 18:51.166
<i>She took me in
when I was fucked-up.</i>

18:53.916 --> 18:55.498
What about you?

18:56.583 --> 18:58.620
I have my own apartment.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.741
Wow!

19:05.500 --> 19:06.991
How did it happen?

19:08.250 --> 19:10.242
I fell in love with a musician.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.495
Dario.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.076
Everyone told me
I shouldn't trust him...

19:17.833 --> 19:22.248
he was trouble, singers don't fall in love
with their fans, they just fuck them...

19:22.833 --> 19:25.075
But I was blind.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.743
They say silly girls give their hearts
to guys who don't deserve it.

19:32.833 --> 19:38.329
To me, there was nothing else but him.
He knew how to make me feel special.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.491
I was in love.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.574
Do you know what that's like?

19:45.750 --> 19:47.161
<i>Go on.</i>

19:53.500 --> 19:57.164
We used to take precautions,
until...

19:57.250 --> 20:00.493
one night, he asked me to do it
without a condom, and I said yes.

20:00.583 --> 20:03.246
Because I loved him
and trusted him.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.744
Then, I took a morning-after pill,
but I didn't think of anything else.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.747
It didn't even cross my mind.
Shortly after, he went on tour.

20:11.833 --> 20:16.828
He called me and said he didn't want any
strings attached, that it wouldn't work.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.415
And he forgot about me.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.325
He was a bastard.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.073
The day he told me he had AIDS
and I should take the test

20:27.166 --> 20:29.658
was the second worst day
of my life.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.453
Was the first
the day you got the results?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.082
Yes.

20:36.833 --> 20:38.665
Seropositive.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.333
But I was lucky.

20:43.666 --> 20:46.830
It's worse to find out
when it's too late, like he did.

20:46.958 --> 20:50.747
At least for the moment,
we have another chance.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.040
We're just that.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.742
Seropositive.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.574
What about you?

21:24.291 --> 21:25.827
What about me?

21:26.833 --> 21:28.995
How did you get infected?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.412
It was a stupid mistake.

21:38.833 --> 21:42.998
I guess you feel the same way,
but I don't like to talk about it, either.

21:45.916 --> 21:49.080
I slept with a girl
and didn't use a condom.

21:50.750 --> 21:54.073
- Are you still seeing her?
- No. It was in Santo Domingo.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.324
Something unexpected.

21:58.916 --> 22:01.249
But it happened and that's it.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.953
How do you manage
to be so strong?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.036
Strong?

22:11.416 --> 22:12.907
What do you mean?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.745
I'm shit-scared.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.495
You don't seem to.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.332
What do you want me to do?

22:23.083 --> 22:25.496
You've been
through the same things.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.666
First, you break down
and get mad at yourself.

22:28.750 --> 22:31.663
Your plans vanish,
just like your future and everything else.

22:34.666 --> 22:37.158
Dani, you and I are just time.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.492
And, if there's no time,

22:41.833 --> 22:43.574
what else do we have left?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.992
Play along with me!

23:23.916 --> 23:26.499
Hello!
We're here for the apartment.

23:26.583 --> 23:29.997
You almost missed it. I was closing.
But come in, please.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.078
<i>I'll turn the power on.</i>

23:37.833 --> 23:39.415
Come on!

23:41.000 --> 23:46.325
It's perfect for a couple like you.
It needs a coat of paint and that's it.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.492
We love it.

23:52.916 --> 23:55.909
- Could you leave us alone for a minute?
- Yeah...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.492
- He's a bit shy.
- Don't worry.

23:58.583 --> 24:03.658
Once you're done, turn the power off and
close the door. Don't think for too long!

24:07.166 --> 24:08.998
What do you think?

24:09.250 --> 24:12.163
Do you always do this
to be left alone with a guy?

24:12.916 --> 24:17.581
I like to do things without knowing what's
gonna happen. To let fate surprise me.

24:17.666 --> 24:20.158
Hey! You didn't tell me
if you like it!

24:20.416 --> 24:23.830
- It's OK.
- It's OK? You didn't see it all!

24:23.916 --> 24:26.829
You didn't see the kitchen,
the bathroom, the bedroom...

24:27.833 --> 24:29.495
Dani...

24:30.250 --> 24:32.583
If this works out well...

24:35.416 --> 24:37.578
Would we move in together?

24:43.833 --> 24:48.157
- Am I going too fast?
- It's just that I wasn't expecting that.

24:49.833 --> 24:52.075
Am I scaring you,
being this direct?

24:53.083 --> 24:54.665
A little bit.

25:19.583 --> 25:21.245
Are you hungry?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.082
Yes.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.164
Hi, good evening.
Do you have home delivery?

25:50.250 --> 25:51.832
<i>You do?</i>

25:52.583 --> 25:55.747
- But, when a guy comes to you, what?
- I just pass.

25:55.833 --> 25:57.495
Just like that?

25:57.583 --> 26:00.655
People run away
when you tell them you're seropositive.

26:00.750 --> 26:04.073
If you don't tell them, you're deceiving
them. If you do, you lose them.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.159
But they might think you're playing
the tough girl or the prude girl.

26:09.583 --> 26:13.076
- That's their problem.
- What if you would have liked someone?

26:13.166 --> 26:15.579
- That didn't happen.
- But what if it did?

26:15.666 --> 26:17.578
I don't know.

26:18.833 --> 26:23.248
I don't know. I closed my mind to it.
I was vulnerable.

26:23.583 --> 26:29.409
When I realized I had to go on
with my life, I put the ad.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.823
- What if no one had answered?
- I knew someone would.

26:32.916 --> 26:34.578
Why?

26:34.916 --> 26:38.000
There's always someone on the other side,
no matter what's your situation.

26:38.583 --> 26:43.328
- You trust humans too much.
- No, I trust life.

26:44.750 --> 26:47.663
What about you?
What were your plans?

26:48.583 --> 26:51.576
- I've never made any plans.
- I believe you.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.912
One can tell.

26:54.833 --> 26:56.995
You live relentlessly.

26:57.083 --> 27:00.155
- Are you a psychologist?
- No.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.833
I'm a woman and I'm not stupid.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.332
You are who you are.

27:05.666 --> 27:11.913
I put the ad, I called you... Many men get
bothered by women taking the initiative.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.575
What if I'm afraid
of falling in love with you?

27:18.166 --> 27:20.499
You're already in love with me.

27:23.166 --> 27:25.749
And I'm not being pretentious.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.242
I've noticed
the way you look at me.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.076
I've noticed you're blushing!

27:35.500 --> 27:38.572
But let me tell you one thing,
you haven't made me laugh yet.

27:39.333 --> 27:41.074
Oh, Dani!

27:41.583 --> 27:45.998
- I'm trivializing it because I'm nervous.
- No, but you're right.

27:47.750 --> 27:52.324
Anyone would fall in love with you
straight away. Anyone who has feelings.

27:52.416 --> 27:55.409
- Maybe I don't have them.
<i>- That's not true.</i>

27:55.750 --> 27:57.332
You don't know me.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.493
We're all made
of truths, lies and...

28:01.583 --> 28:04.906
in the end,
there's always the same left.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.162
one look, one touch...

28:07.500 --> 28:09.742
You're a romantic, just like me.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.833
Maybe we're the last ones.

28:13.416 --> 28:15.078
Wanna dance?

28:15.166 --> 28:18.159
- There's no music.
- Just imagine it.

28:19.083 --> 28:23.407
<i>Her arms have entangled me again,
they have tricked me and wheedled me,</i>

28:23.500 --> 28:26.664
<i>leaving me incapable
of even speaking.</i>

28:26.916 --> 28:29.329
<i>Her body is like a magnet.</i>

28:29.416 --> 28:34.241
<i>If I come near it to play,
it leaves me completely stunned.</i>

28:34.916 --> 28:37.408
<i>Her eyes tell the truth</i>

28:37.500 --> 28:42.575
<i>and sometimes lie without mercy,
wandering about.</i>

28:43.583 --> 28:46.246
<i>She's like that,</i>

28:47.083 --> 28:50.827
<i>a woman for me.</i>

28:51.000 --> 28:55.825
<i>And her waist is like a yo-yo
she and I play with,</i>

28:55.916 --> 28:58.909
<i>turning it around and around.</i>

28:59.000 --> 29:01.663
<i>Kissing her lips means to live,</i>

29:01.750 --> 29:06.575
<i>to devour this moment.</i>

29:06.916 --> 29:11.411
<i>My arms move slowly now,
flying like a cormorant,</i>

29:11.500 --> 29:14.743
<i>swinging with the wind,</i>

29:15.416 --> 29:18.500
<i>changing the tides</i>

29:19.333 --> 29:22.576
<i>with gentle movements.</i>

29:24.416 --> 29:27.909
<i>She appears
and disappears again...</i>

29:28.416 --> 29:32.160
<i>She slips between my fingers
like a fish.</i>

29:32.750 --> 29:35.993
<i>I want her
as if I was about to lose her.</i>

29:36.083 --> 29:38.325
<i>She's like that,</i>

29:39.000 --> 29:42.323
<i>a woman for me.</i>

29:50.916 --> 29:55.331
<i>Her arms are like a place
to run away to and forget everything,</i>

29:55.416 --> 29:58.580
<i>a home, an eternity...</i>

29:59.750 --> 30:02.413
<i>an infinite sea</i>

30:03.500 --> 30:06.914
<i>- to navigate.</i>
- Yes, let's go.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.663
It was a very special night.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.074
It was to me too.

30:13.583 --> 30:16.906
- Do you want us to meet tomorrow?
- Yes.

30:17.833 --> 30:21.326
Would you mind picking me up here,
like a date and all that?

30:21.750 --> 30:23.412
Sure.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.574
Alright, then.

30:28.666 --> 30:32.410
<i>She slips between my fingers
like a fish.</i>

30:32.500 --> 30:35.993
<i>I want her
as if I was about to lose her.</i>

30:36.083 --> 30:38.666
<i>She's like that,</i>

30:39.083 --> 30:42.906
<i>a woman for me.</i>

30:44.416 --> 30:47.909
<i>She appears
and disappears again...</i>

30:48.250 --> 30:52.164
<i>She slips between my fingers
like a fish.</i>

30:52.500 --> 30:55.914
<i>I want her
as if I was about to lose her.</i>

30:56.000 --> 30:58.913
<i>She's like that,</i>

30:59.000 --> 31:02.744
<i>a woman for me.</i>

31:03.166 --> 31:05.749
<i>She's like that...</i>

31:05.833 --> 31:08.075
See you tomorrow.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.409
<i>A woman for me.</i>

31:11.500 --> 31:15.244
<i>For me.</i>

31:19.166 --> 31:20.828
What?

31:24.500 --> 31:26.332
See you tomorrow.

32:10.666 --> 32:13.750
Good morning!
<i>Ensaimada</i>! Great!

32:13.833 --> 32:17.406
- That is so cool of you!
<i>- It's Sunday.</i>

32:22.833 --> 32:26.656
- And you've woken up early.
- I just got home. I didn't go to bed yet.

32:26.750 --> 32:29.822
- You don't look like that.
- Yeah...

32:29.916 --> 32:34.331
That's because it wasn't
really an exhausting night.

32:34.416 --> 32:38.660
I've spent the night arguing with Ismael.
What about your night?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.657
Good.

32:43.333 --> 32:46.155
- I like him?
- Seriously?

32:46.250 --> 32:47.912
Yes.

32:48.250 --> 32:51.664
- He's so cute.
- You said you were taking it slow.

32:51.750 --> 32:56.495
I know, Gloria! But now I see there's
no such thing as being totally sure.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.326
You always have
to take some kind of risk.

32:59.500 --> 33:04.416
Alright. Someone has to play
the devil's advocate and that's me.

33:04.833 --> 33:09.578
A one-night stand is one thing.
I would encourage you to do it myself!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.162
But this...

33:12.833 --> 33:15.416
What makes you see things
so clearly so soon?

33:16.666 --> 33:18.828
He's transparent.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.744
He looks at me
as if he hadn't seen a girl before.

33:23.833 --> 33:26.997
- Like a scared cat.
- Just what I needed to hear!

33:28.166 --> 33:30.579
I don't know...
There's something about him...

33:35.166 --> 33:38.250
- Delicious.
- You mean the <i>ensaimada</i> or him?

33:39.250 --> 33:43.665
- Don't take your bad night out on me!
- Leave my night alone and keep talking.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.163
- What about him?
- What?

33:47.166 --> 33:50.250
- He likes me.
- What if he does want a one-night stand?

33:50.333 --> 33:52.165
- He's not that type.
- How do you know?

33:52.250 --> 33:54.742
- He's not!
- Just because he's seropositive

33:54.833 --> 33:57.416
he has to be a good guy?

33:57.666 --> 34:00.750
- How did he get infected?
- Shit, Gloria.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.746
- He had unprotected sex.
- Just like that?

34:04.833 --> 34:08.156
What do you mean...? It happened
in Santo Domingo and it was a crazy thing.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.913
- So he put it where he shouldn't have.
- Come on!

34:11.000 --> 34:15.916
- Well, that's not a point in his favor.
- Fine. Are you sure about Ismael?

34:16.250 --> 34:17.991
Alright, touché.

34:18.083 --> 34:22.908
But that's different. I didn't put an ad
and I know what he's up to.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.074
Look, Gloria.
We all carry an ad around.

34:27.166 --> 34:32.581
They say: "Help", "I want to get laid"
or "I believe in everlasting love".

34:32.666 --> 34:35.579
- You're ready to be with him forever!
- I don't know!

34:35.666 --> 34:39.409
That's not love, Sol!
That's desperation!

35:02.333 --> 35:03.744
- What?
- Nothing.

35:03.833 --> 35:06.075
Sandro is sleeping, be quiet.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.322
- Do you want to talk?
- Yes, but I'm in a hurry.

35:16.750 --> 35:18.332
What is it?

35:20.333 --> 35:22.245
I like her.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.743
- You like her.
- More than that.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.326
- How many times have you seen her?
- Twice.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.708
- And you have a crush on her already?
- Yes.

35:33.833 --> 35:35.790
Even if she has AIDS?

35:35.833 --> 35:38.496
- She's seropositive.
- Call it whatever you want.

35:38.583 --> 35:41.246
<i>What do you think
she'll say when she finds out?</i>

35:41.333 --> 35:43.245
That's the question.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.492
As long as she doesn't know...

35:45.583 --> 35:50.749
- As long as she doesn't know, it's OK.
- What do you think this is? Great love?

35:51.166 --> 35:56.912
Apart from the fear that you should have
to have sex with her, even using a condom,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.573
<i>I can think of a dozen reasons
to ask you not to go on with this.</i>

36:00.791 --> 36:04.740
<i>For her, because you're gonna fuck her up,
but also for yourself.</i>

36:05.166 --> 36:08.079
Don't you see
she can develop a deadly illness?

36:08.333 --> 36:12.077
- And don't you see I can help her?
- Do you think it's that easy?

36:12.750 --> 36:15.163
I've been living with Sandro
for three months.

36:15.500 --> 36:19.915
And I swear it's complicated.
It's damn hard!

36:20.666 --> 36:23.079
- I'm not convincing you, am I?
- No.

36:23.458 --> 36:27.122
No. Since Mamen left me,
I see things differently.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.826
Either you tell her
or forget about her.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.539
- Hey, Dani!
- What's up, dude? I was leaving.

36:37.833 --> 36:40.576
Don't worry.
How are you doing?

36:40.666 --> 36:42.328
Just getting by.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.994
- I can see that.
- I'll leave you alone. We'll talk later.

36:47.083 --> 36:48.995
Hey, call me.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.741
Are you gonna tell me?

36:59.500 --> 37:01.833
It's a complicated story.

37:01.916 --> 37:03.657
Yeah, I figure.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.575
Knowing Dani,
anything is possible.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.533
Yes, but this time
it's different.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.082
Shoot.

37:14.416 --> 37:17.500
- Come on.
- Later.

37:22.666 --> 37:26.740
A TAD OF MAY...

37:27.250 --> 37:28.832
Mamen!

37:29.416 --> 37:31.248
How are you?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.040
What do you want?

37:34.416 --> 37:37.159
Nothing, just see you and talk to you.
Five minutes.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.912
<i>No.</i>

37:39.000 --> 37:43.415
- Please, it's important.
- I won't get back with you, forget it.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.493
- It's not about that.
- Fuck you, Dani.

37:46.541 --> 37:49.249
Mamen, I swear I won't ask you
to get back with me.

37:50.166 --> 37:51.748
Really?

37:51.833 --> 37:53.825
No, this time it's about me.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.824
- I'm not interested.
- Can't we go to the bar and talk?

37:58.916 --> 38:02.159
- No way, Dani!
- OK.

38:03.458 --> 38:07.748
Then, please, answer me a question.
Just one question.

38:09.708 --> 38:11.745
Mamen, did I make you laugh?

38:12.333 --> 38:16.657
- What?
- I know it's more complicated than that,

38:17.083 --> 38:19.621
but please answer.
Did I make you laugh?

38:21.416 --> 38:24.033
Yes. You did
at the beginning.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.832
You were funny.

38:27.250 --> 38:32.075
You were witty and always found a way
for us to have fun.

38:34.166 --> 38:36.749
It didn't last long,
but it was the best part of it.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.866
What happened next?

38:39.250 --> 38:44.075
- Next, your real self showed up.
- Come on. Did I treat you that bad?

38:44.250 --> 38:46.913
Dani, there was
always an article,

38:47.333 --> 38:52.158
a report, a fascinating subject. Always
something or someone more important.

38:52.250 --> 38:55.664
- No, that's not true.
- Yes, it is true, Dani!

38:55.833 --> 38:57.995
At least, that's how I felt.

39:00.750 --> 39:03.242
I loved the Dani
who knew how to move me.

39:04.083 --> 39:06.746
The one that made me feel
like a goddess.

39:07.416 --> 39:09.078
That one...

39:09.166 --> 39:11.328
That one did make me laugh.

39:14.416 --> 39:16.749
Is this what you wanted to hear?

39:23.833 --> 39:25.574
What's wrong?

39:27.166 --> 39:28.873
I don't know.

39:30.458 --> 39:32.165
Are you OK?

39:34.416 --> 39:35.907
No.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.324
Who is she?

39:38.666 --> 39:41.909
- Why does it have to be someone?
- I know it does.

39:42.416 --> 39:46.831
I hope you're looking
at your heart for the first time.

39:47.375 --> 39:50.493
- Why do you say that?
- Your eyes.

39:51.916 --> 39:53.999
They look different.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.078
Well, this is my house.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.074
This way.

40:49.083 --> 40:51.575
It has nothing to do with mine.

40:54.416 --> 40:56.829
Would you show me your room?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.332
Sure.

41:09.666 --> 41:13.740
THINGS I LIKE ABOUT DANI

41:17.333 --> 41:20.497
Stop peeking!
That's private! Dani!

41:20.583 --> 41:24.247
OK, I'll stop. But just because
you wrote that you like my butt.

41:24.333 --> 41:25.995
You're such an idiot!

41:32.583 --> 41:34.916
Shaggy Japanese chicks?

41:35.416 --> 41:39.990
- You have good taste in movies.
- I don't like it. I used to work in this.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.742
- Were you a porn star?
- No!

41:43.250 --> 41:47.164
I used to dubbed them.
I specialized in Japanese movies.

41:47.250 --> 41:49.412
- Holy shit!
- What?

41:49.500 --> 41:52.823
Hey, when I left home,
any job was a luxury.

41:52.875 --> 41:55.663
Except working as a Playboy bunny,
I did all kinds of things.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.245
And what do you do now?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.243
In the summer, I work
as a waitress in a sidewalk café.

42:06.333 --> 42:10.498
In the future, I'd like to find a job
related to photography.

42:10.583 --> 42:13.576
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

42:13.916 --> 42:15.532
They're good.

42:15.833 --> 42:17.495
Thanks.

42:20.416 --> 42:23.159
Let's have some dinner.
I bought Japanese food.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.583
So it's Japanese night today?

42:27.416 --> 42:29.328
I finally made you laugh.

42:30.083 --> 42:32.200
Yes, you did.
Come on.

42:47.916 --> 42:51.500
- What is it?
- I could never handle these.

42:51.583 --> 42:53.415
Let me help you.

42:54.166 --> 42:55.828
<i>Look.</i>

42:56.333 --> 42:57.995
Like this.

42:59.750 --> 43:01.742
You're terrible!

43:02.333 --> 43:03.744
Let's see...

43:08.333 --> 43:09.824
Better?

43:11.833 --> 43:13.495
<i>That's it!</i>

43:15.000 --> 43:17.413
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

43:19.000 --> 43:21.947
<i>- Hold on! Hold on!</i>
- It's like...

43:22.083 --> 43:26.498
It's as if I was looking at you,
you know?

43:26.625 --> 43:30.323
- It's mind-blowing!
- OK! Give me that! You've seen enough!

43:30.416 --> 43:33.909
<i>- Oh! I'm coming!</i>
- No! I want to hear you coming!

43:34.000 --> 43:36.162
What?
You're gross!

43:36.500 --> 43:38.082
<i>Yes!</i>

44:10.750 --> 44:12.912
Wait.
Give me some.

44:14.291 --> 44:16.123
I can't believe it!

44:27.833 --> 44:29.324
Shit.

44:43.333 --> 44:45.165
It burns, doesn't it?

44:54.416 --> 44:56.328
What are you thinking about?

44:56.833 --> 44:58.495
Nothing.

44:59.166 --> 45:01.704
Don't you ever talk about
what's happening to you?

45:02.166 --> 45:03.657
No.

45:03.750 --> 45:05.867
Denial or caution?

45:07.416 --> 45:09.328
Both, I guess.

45:14.208 --> 45:17.326
- Tell me what you were thinking about!
- Nothing, really!

45:20.083 --> 45:23.030
Have you made love with anyone
since you found out?

45:24.625 --> 45:26.241
No.

45:26.708 --> 45:28.324
Me neither.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.332
Do you miss it?

45:34.333 --> 45:37.405
Not the physical part,
but I do miss the emotional part.

45:43.083 --> 45:45.496
What?
It's there again!

45:45.583 --> 45:48.075
- What?
- That look!

45:52.416 --> 45:55.159
I guess I wasn't ready for this.

46:05.583 --> 46:09.657
- What is it? You still don't trust me?
- I do trust you, Sol.

46:10.500 --> 46:13.322
- I don't trust myself.
- But if you don't try things,

46:13.416 --> 46:16.079
you'll never know
if they'd work out fine.

46:23.250 --> 46:27.164
- Sol...
- Look, forget it! Really. We...

46:28.833 --> 46:31.905
We have plenty of time for this.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.914
I know I overwhelmed you when I talked
about moving in together if it worked out.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.119
But we could keep getting to know
each other better and then decide.

46:41.250 --> 46:43.333
There's no hurry.

46:43.541 --> 46:46.375
Inevitable things are
good and bad at the same time.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.207
Maybe.

46:52.458 --> 46:54.165
Oh, God!

46:54.750 --> 46:58.448
I'm gonna fetch some towels,
or we'll get cold.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.333
- Do you want to have one last drink?
- Yes.

47:17.833 --> 47:20.496
This was our third date.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.916
The turning point.

47:24.250 --> 47:25.957
What do you mean?

47:27.083 --> 47:30.781
Well... I mean
we know each other...

47:31.291 --> 47:35.205
a bit more. We know what we want
and what we expect.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.072
But I still see fear

47:39.750 --> 47:41.742
in your eyes.

47:42.083 --> 47:45.497
- And that something that puzzles me.
- Do you see puzzlement in my eyes?

47:45.583 --> 47:50.123
Yes. Not even what we're feeling now
can wipe it off?

47:51.708 --> 47:54.655
- You're incredible.
- No, I'm not.

47:55.083 --> 47:57.621
But I don't want
to look like I'm stupid either.

47:58.250 --> 48:01.914
Dani, I didn't know
what I was going to find.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.947
I had set the bar low.
Very low.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.826
You've been more
than I expected to get.

48:09.708 --> 48:14.624
And it makes me so happy. So much so
that I'm terrified that it could go wrong.

48:28.541 --> 48:30.123
Sol...

48:32.791 --> 48:35.750
- I need to tell you one thing.
- Dani, wait.

48:35.833 --> 48:38.200
Don't say anything tonight.

48:39.916 --> 48:43.455
Let's give ourselves two days.

48:43.541 --> 48:46.033
Two days to be more sure.

48:51.625 --> 48:53.241
Yes?

49:29.500 --> 49:32.038
- Will you call me?
- Sure.

49:56.041 --> 50:00.206
<i>No, you can leave a message.
When he's back...</i>

50:00.958 --> 50:03.871
- Elias, do you have a minute?
- Yes, come in.

50:05.750 --> 50:07.207
Well...

50:07.500 --> 50:09.207
How is it going?

50:09.458 --> 50:11.120
Bad.

50:11.916 --> 50:15.125
It's going bad. I don't think
I will be able to write that article.

50:15.208 --> 50:18.121
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

50:18.208 --> 50:21.531
You said you'd do a deep research.
Something different, original,

50:21.625 --> 50:25.744
with a personal, straightforward approach.
About a forgotten, taboo subject.

50:25.833 --> 50:28.576
- Yes, I know what I said.
- So?

50:29.458 --> 50:32.530
Well, I've changed my mind
and...

50:32.833 --> 50:38.033
I can't write it. Give it to someone else,
do what you have to do, but I just can't.

50:38.416 --> 50:40.203
Listen, Dani.

50:40.291 --> 50:44.160
You're good. You've done
some fairly decent things here.

50:44.250 --> 50:47.573
You've got ideas and style.
It's in your blood.

50:47.666 --> 50:50.659
But that's all. You can't afford
to do something like this yet.

50:50.750 --> 50:53.037
- I know, I'm sorry.
- No, you don't know.

50:53.125 --> 50:58.450
And I don't give a shit that you're sorry!
It'd be our special report in two weeks!

50:58.541 --> 51:02.410
And on the front page!
Your first front page, for fuck's sake!

51:03.875 --> 51:05.537
What's wrong with you?

51:07.791 --> 51:10.704
- It's personal.
- Shit, Dani!

51:10.791 --> 51:15.661
It's just a report on AIDS in Spain today.
The way they live, the things they feel...

51:16.541 --> 51:19.124
- What's going on?
- Elias, please, it's personal.

51:19.208 --> 51:24.374
Don't give me that bullshit.
Where do you think you are? College?

51:25.291 --> 51:27.624
I thought you'd kill
to write that report.

51:28.708 --> 51:30.449
And I would have.

51:31.208 --> 51:32.915
Have you got involved?

51:33.833 --> 51:35.415
Dani!

51:37.125 --> 51:39.993
Give me this week.
OK?

51:40.083 --> 51:43.201
- You're not gonna tell me?
- Not now. I can't.

51:44.708 --> 51:46.165
Fine.

51:46.250 --> 51:50.699
Aguirre got sick.
Maxi will give you his notes.

51:50.791 --> 51:52.327
You write it.

52:02.208 --> 52:04.291
- Elias...
- I've got work to do.

52:16.541 --> 52:18.203
How did it go?

52:19.958 --> 52:22.120
I think I need a drink.

52:32.833 --> 52:35.120
I think I need a drink too.

52:39.500 --> 52:42.538
In the three months I've been
working here, we'd never talked.

52:42.625 --> 52:45.333
Sorry, I'm not going
through a good time.

52:45.416 --> 52:46.952
I know.

52:47.041 --> 52:48.907
- You do?
- Well,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.492
people in the office say
your girlfriend left you.

52:51.541 --> 52:53.954
- Those bigmouths!
- It's OK.

52:54.041 --> 52:58.911
When you think you have something serious
and it ends, you feel like you're naked.

52:59.708 --> 53:02.746
Do you by chance know something
about the extinction of whales?

53:03.625 --> 53:07.244
He gave you Aguirre's report, didn't he?
If it makes you feel any better,

53:07.333 --> 53:11.452
I've been writing all the shit
no one wants to write since I arrived.

53:11.833 --> 53:14.997
- So you'll end up doing alright.
- Yeah, I guess.

53:15.083 --> 53:17.575
But it sucks anyway.

53:24.041 --> 53:26.533
Hey, do you believe in aliens?

53:26.625 --> 53:31.950
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. Silences make feel uncomfortable.

53:33.041 --> 53:34.577
But do you?

53:35.541 --> 53:37.828
I only believe
in the Rolling Stones.

53:37.916 --> 53:41.080
The eternal question.
Beatles versus Rolling Stones.

53:41.166 --> 53:44.204
- Which do you prefer?
- Debunking myths.

53:44.291 --> 53:45.623
What?

53:45.708 --> 53:49.952
I mean the Beatles-Rolling Stones rivalry
is full of myths and legends.

53:50.041 --> 53:51.748
- Really?
- Really.

53:51.833 --> 53:55.372
The Beatles want to hold your hand and
the Rolling Stones want to burn your city.

53:55.916 --> 53:58.909
- You're a know-it-all.
- That line is not mine.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.324
- But which do you prefer?
- The Beatles. They were the first ones.

54:03.416 --> 54:05.658
The Rolling Stones came after.

54:05.750 --> 54:09.118
I wouldn't mind having an affair
with one of them, though.

54:09.708 --> 54:12.371
- What about you?
- Which do I prefer...?

54:12.458 --> 54:14.791
No.
Not that.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.742
Who would you have
an affair with?

54:18.500 --> 54:21.618
Listen...
I'm sorry, it's not you...

54:21.708 --> 54:24.655
No, no!
I didn't mean it like that.

54:24.750 --> 54:28.539
I just wanted to know
your type of girl, that's all.

54:29.333 --> 54:31.620
So you know
nothing about whales.

54:36.666 --> 54:38.123
No!

54:42.541 --> 54:46.160
- OK! Stop it!
- Say it! Say it!

54:48.291 --> 54:51.875
<i>- You scare me.
- Me? Why?</i>

54:51.958 --> 54:56.032
Dreams hardly ever come true. I'd like you
to have your feet on the ground.

54:56.125 --> 55:00.620
My feet are already on the ground.
I feel so good, so happy...

55:01.291 --> 55:04.989
- You've seen him three times, God!
- So?

55:05.166 --> 55:10.116
You haven't even slept together yet,
so you don't know if you really like him.

55:10.208 --> 55:13.121
Look, even if I took
the best of my orgasms

55:13.458 --> 55:15.700
and multiplied it by ten,

55:16.166 --> 55:19.580
it wouldn't be even close
to what I feel when he looks at me.

55:22.708 --> 55:25.451
But he's not even sure about it!

55:26.000 --> 55:27.616
He loves me.

55:27.708 --> 55:29.870
Really?
He loves you?

55:31.666 --> 55:35.910
Look, the circumstances
made it different.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.415
We are different.

55:38.541 --> 55:43.457
No, sweetheart, no. Everybody loves you.
You're sweet, you're a magnet.

55:43.541 --> 55:47.205
Sure! But if they found out,
they'd run away. So?

55:48.541 --> 55:51.534
- I'm just saying that maybe...
- Look, Gloria.

55:51.625 --> 55:53.992
Dani doesn't run away
because he's like me.

55:54.083 --> 55:55.619
He's like me.

55:55.708 --> 56:01.329
Yes, maybe we're living in a dream
or trapped in an illusion, whatever.

56:01.541 --> 56:06.332
But this made us have hope again.
The problem is...

56:07.291 --> 56:11.786
He refuses to face up to reality,
he's confused...

56:12.416 --> 56:15.159
as if he didn't understand
what's happening to him.

56:15.375 --> 56:17.708
What if he's desperate?

56:18.625 --> 56:20.787
Why don't you help me?

56:20.875 --> 56:24.949
Shit, all the couples start dating even if
they're not sure if it'll last forever.

56:25.041 --> 56:28.455
It still sounds to me
like an impossible love.

56:31.458 --> 56:35.532
Well, I don't think there's such thing
as impossible love, just bigoted idiots.

56:39.541 --> 56:41.407
It's ringing.

56:45.833 --> 56:47.995
- Won't you answer it?
- No.

56:48.541 --> 56:52.615
- He's been calling for days.
- I know, but I don't want to.

56:52.708 --> 56:55.325
No...
I'm not ready for it.

56:57.250 --> 57:01.415
Maybe when you're ready
it'll be too late and you'll regret it.

57:03.375 --> 57:06.914
Gloria, I don't like goodbyes.

58:26.083 --> 58:27.824
<i>Mrs. Amalia...</i>

58:28.041 --> 58:29.828
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

58:30.916 --> 58:32.498
<i>How is he?</i>

58:32.625 --> 58:34.036
<i>Bad.</i>

58:34.416 --> 58:36.282
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

58:40.166 --> 58:41.998
<i>I'll leave you alone.</i>

58:50.333 --> 58:51.869
Sol!

59:03.000 --> 59:04.741
Hi, Dario.

59:06.125 --> 59:07.991
Come in, please.

59:24.583 --> 59:26.620
Thanks for coming.

59:32.916 --> 59:34.532
Sit down.

59:43.041 --> 59:45.203
I needed to see you.

59:47.750 --> 59:50.458
I've had a lot of time
to think and...

59:51.791 --> 59:53.999
And I never said I was sorry.

59:56.041 --> 59:57.782
I'm sorry.

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:01.866
Me too.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.540
Do you hate me?

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:09.289
Yes, but not because
of what you think.

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:12.708
I loved you blindly
and I trusted you.

01:00:12.916 --> 01:00:15.249
There's just one way to hate.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:21.243
And that word should be removed
from the dictionary.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:29.656
- If I could...
- It's OK, Dario. It's alright.

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.997
It's useless to think
about what could have happened.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:35.949
Everything is different.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.700
But not necessarily worse.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.787
I look at life differently.

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:46.833
It hurts so much to go.

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.916
Maybe you were never here.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.287
My love...

01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:04.250
Thanks for your apology,
I needed it.

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:06.700
And thanks
for making me come here.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.999
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:15.579
Because now I want
to live to the fullest.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.992
You've always been so special.

01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:26.828
You made me feel special.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.538
You were the best thing
in my life.

01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:35.620
The best thing.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:44.749
- I don't know what else to say.
- Don't say anything.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:50.371
I'd like to see you smile.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.574
For the last time.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.707
Please.

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:09.491
Goodbye, Dario.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:12.449
Goodbye.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.366
Come here.

01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:55.325
Bye.

01:03:58.375 --> 01:04:03.621
BOYS
I WILL NEVER FORGET

01:05:00.875 --> 01:05:04.039
<i>Hi, I'm Dani.
Leave your message after the beep.</i>

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:08.078
Dani.

01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:12.782
I love you.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.661
<i>Sol!</i>

01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:53.248
Hey! Hi!

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:02.492
It seems
like the end of the world.

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:06.117
- You're soaked!
- I know.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:09.447
I needed to get wet.
To feel alive.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.453
What are you doing here
this early?

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:15.165
Come here.

01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:17.699
What's wrong?

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:19.699
<i>Sol...</i>

01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:21.745
Your Dani...

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:26.242
- What did he tell you?
- He's not "my" Dani.

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:29.280
- Sol, what did he tell you?
- About what?

01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:31.623
About his job.

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:34.408
- That he's a web designer.
- Just that?

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.662
- Yes.
- Daniel Torras.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.241
Yes!

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:48.031
WHALES

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.208
- I don't get it.
- Look at the signature.

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:57.158
<i>He's a journalist.</i>

01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:02.082
But Dani...

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:04.624
I called the magazine...

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:08.530
He is...
He's writing a report

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:12.448
about AIDS today.

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:17.708
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm only asking you three questions
and I want the truth.

01:08:29.166 --> 01:08:32.033
Are you the Daniel Torras
who writes for the newspaper?

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:37.082
Answer me, will you?

01:08:38.375 --> 01:08:42.038
- Sol, listen...
- No! No! Is that you?

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.707
Yes.

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:48.290
So you're a journalist.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.991
Yes.

01:08:56.125 --> 01:08:58.332
Are you seropositive?

01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:04.282
No.

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:09.287
- Come on, honey.
- Sol! Sol, listen!

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:13.368
- You've got your report.
- Sol! Wait! Take this!

01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:17.075
Sol, open the door, please!

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.241
She won't answer.

01:09:38.457 --> 01:09:40.825
This time, I really screwed up.

01:09:43.707 --> 01:09:45.243
Does it hurt?

01:09:45.707 --> 01:09:48.325
I think I'm immune
to everything except her.

01:09:51.707 --> 01:09:53.825
Then disappear.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:57.038
Take a few days off.
Summer is almost here.

01:09:57.125 --> 01:10:02.120
As Napoleon said:
"The only victory over love is flight."

01:10:02.458 --> 01:10:05.075
- Just don't go to London.
- Why?

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:09.285
What do you mean why?
Because all our idols died there.

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:11.412
And at 27 too.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:15.790
Shit, Lidia.
You and your sense of humor!

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.538
I don't want you
to turn this into a tragedy.

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.412
Stop it.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.742
Dani, time flies.

01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:46.951
Keep the good memories
and turn this page in your life.

01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:50.412
I swear I don't know how.

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:55.910
I like this page so much
that I don't know how to move on.

01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:02.375
Then maybe you should change
the whole book.

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:08.245
Are you a journalist?

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.157
Yes.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:17.787
Are you seropositive?

01:11:18.791 --> 01:11:20.157
No.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:29.291
All the songs remind me of you.

01:11:34.416 --> 01:11:36.874
<i>Songs always lie.</i>

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:48.541
But I love you all the same.

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:19.916
ALL THROUGH SEPTEMBER.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.413
Thanks for helping me out
with the report.

01:13:22.958 --> 01:13:26.076
That's the normal thing to do
between colleagues, right?

01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:29.125
- What's normal and what's not?
- Why do you say that now?

01:13:29.208 --> 01:13:32.952
Half the world seems to have gone crazy
and the other half was already crazy.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:36.125
- And where do we fit in?
- I was already crazy.

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:37.744
Me too.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:40.621
- Do you miss her?
- Who?

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.951
Your ex.
Mamen, right?

01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:46.374
Do you know what she said
to ditch me?

01:13:47.083 --> 01:13:51.077
Only groupies, dealers and members
of the band can stay in the dressing room.

01:13:55.541 --> 01:13:57.328
<i>"Una sola notte".</i>

01:13:58.125 --> 01:13:59.957
Do you speak Italian?

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:03.250
The song they're playing.
<i>"Una sola notte".</i>

01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:07.498
Just one night.
And, yes, I speak Italian.

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.996
- Cool, huh?
- Very cool.

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:35.121
<i>Well, everything is perfect, Sol.</i>

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.908
- What?
- You're strong as an ox.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.868
You lost weight though.
Aren't you eating well?

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:44.622
- Yes.
- Well, something happened to you.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.572
- A few things, yes.
- Like what?

01:15:50.416 --> 01:15:54.740
- The guy who passed it to me died.
- Don't let negative things get into you.

01:15:54.833 --> 01:15:57.871
Right now,
your mind is the best medicine.

01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:01.827
- You know I try to be positive. But...
<i>- Sometimes we hit rock bottom, I know.</i>

01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:05.375
<i>But, when that happens, we must
get back on our feet no matter what.</i>

01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:09.281
- Yes.
- Why did you went to see that guy?

01:16:09.708 --> 01:16:12.621
He called me.
He wanted to apologize.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:16.494
- Maybe you shouldn't have gone.
<i>- I know.</i>

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:20.242
But maybe I needed it too.

01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:26.782
Well, Sol. There's not much I can do,
but you can. Take care and eat well.

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:30.869
Go out! Have fun! You're going
to live many years, trust me.

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:33.200
- Are you dating anyone?
- No.

01:16:33.291 --> 01:16:36.580
<i>- Well, do it.</i>
- Right, like it's that easy!

01:16:36.708 --> 01:16:41.123
You're young and attractive. You have
something special and you know it.

01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:43.871
<i>- Use it.</i>
- Who would want to date me?

01:16:43.958 --> 01:16:46.120
<i>- Give it a try.</i>
- I did. It didn't work.

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:48.450
Was he seropositive?
Did he know you...?

01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:49.998
Yes!

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:53.746
Well, you're not the type
that gives up.

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:59.040
If I date someone and tell them
that I'm seropositive, they run off.

01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:03.074
- If I don't tell them, I'm lying to them.
- There's always a middle way.

01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:06.409
Look for it.
Not everyone is an idiot out there.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.073
As a matter of fact,
do you want to go out with me?

01:17:13.916 --> 01:17:17.455
- Not even you would dare to do that.
- Says who? I'm a free man!

01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:20.579
My wife died
last year from cancer.

01:17:20.666 --> 01:17:24.125
- I'm sorry.
- Do you know how it feels to be a doctor

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:29.078
and not being able to do anything
for the person you love the most?

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:32.989
But I'm here.
And I'm going to live.

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:36.076
Not just for myself,
but also for her.

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:40.282
Don't go through this alone, Sol.
Share it with someone.

01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:02.663
- Long time no see.
- I know.

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:05.288
Too much work.
I spend all day at the office.

01:19:06.125 --> 01:19:07.957
<i>How are things with Marta?</i>

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:11.000
- Just fine.
- Good!

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:12.540
Right?

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:18.782
- I miss Sol.
- Do you really see yourself with a girl

01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:22.949
you wouldn't be able to make love with
without all the precautions in the world?

01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:25.033
I've been thinking about that.

01:19:25.166 --> 01:19:28.455
- The pros and cons.
- You mean the few pros and the many cons.

01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:32.160
Well, I've been thinking about it and
the only thing I know is that I miss her.

01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:37.122
I think that was kind of like a rush
which made you mistake love for...

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:41.202
- necessity, work... I don't know.
- No, Lidia.

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:44.079
You didn't get to know her.
She was special.

01:19:44.166 --> 01:19:46.453
- Alright, so what?
- So what?

01:19:46.541 --> 01:19:48.954
- Yeah!
- I fell in love, Lidia!

01:19:49.041 --> 01:19:52.250
And I screwed up because
I did everything wrong from minute one!

01:19:52.333 --> 01:19:55.701
- I don't like to see you like this.
- Everything can be overcome.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.575
What if come over for dinner
tonight with Marta?

01:19:58.666 --> 01:20:02.125
I'll go. I swear.
But when I'm in a better mood.

01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:05.747
Good.
I have to go home now.

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:30.036
How is he?

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.242
Not well.
He misses her.

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:35.620
I thought he was with that girl.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.412
I don't know.
I'm worried.

01:20:38.666 --> 01:20:41.830
- He should go and see her, then.
- It's complicated.

01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:46.456
- I had never seen him like this.
- You must go through it to get over it.

01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:48.369
I don't know...

01:20:50.416 --> 01:20:52.282
You and I...

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:54.286
What?

01:20:56.666 --> 01:20:58.658
Will things go well for us?

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.870
Who knows that?
Huh?

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.249
So?
What did the doctor say?

01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:25.413
No news. I'm fine.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.492
Do you want to go out
and celebrate?

01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:34.750
Why don't we order some pizza
and celebrate here?

01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:37.325
Because it's not the same, Sol.
Listen.

01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:40.454
There's a world out there
that you don't see!

01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:44.160
- Come on.
- I'm not in the mood. I'm really not.

01:21:46.666 --> 01:21:48.498
Do you miss him?

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:56.825
- In spite of everything?
- Yes.

01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:01.697
He acted as a real jerk.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.664
Yes, he acted like a jerk,
but I don't know if he was a jerk.

01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:10.117
Because
I didn't let him explain.

01:22:17.875 --> 01:22:19.958
Gloria, what's wrong?

01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.624
I thought
you were getting over him.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:31.449
Well, step by step.
I still miss him, but...

01:22:34.041 --> 01:22:35.953
Don't worry.

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:43.120
- Gloria.
- I'll be right back.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.120
What's wrong?

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.036
Gloria!

01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:57.249
- Take it.
- What's this?

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:05.165
He must...

01:23:05.916 --> 01:23:10.365
He must have left it in the mailbox.
I saw it the following day.

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:14.577
- What?
- He brought it when he came to see you.

01:23:14.666 --> 01:23:17.830
- Why didn't you give it to me then?
- I don't know. I guess I...

01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:21.535
- I wanted to protect you.
- To protect me? From what?

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:25.621
- It was my decision!
- Sol! Forgive me!

01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:29.702
- You had no right!
- I know!

01:23:37.375 --> 01:23:39.332
Maybe now...

01:23:39.458 --> 01:23:41.575
that things have quieten down...

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:45.573
Right? Maybe it will be easier
for you to make a decision.

01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:02.537
It's OK.

01:24:26.375 --> 01:24:29.618
<i>Sol, I don't even know
how to start this letter.</i>

01:24:29.708 --> 01:24:34.533
<i>Maybe I'll start by telling you the truth.
Just promise me you won't stop reading.</i>

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:36.241
<i>Will you?</i>

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:38.537
<i>I'm a journalist.</i>

01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:43.625
<i>My boss asked me to write
a deep analysis about AIDS in Spain.</i>

01:24:43.708 --> 01:24:48.533
<i>To me, being a journalist is everything.
Or at least it was before I met you.</i>

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:54.661
<i>Your ad was just what I was looking for.
The intimate side of it.</i>

01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:58.207
<i>You know the rest.</i>

01:24:58.416 --> 01:25:01.659
<i>That afternoon, as soon as I saw you,
I fell in love with you.</i>

01:25:02.625 --> 01:25:06.949
<i>Then, when I realized what I had done,
lying to you, my life turned into hell.</i>

01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:10.246
<i>Something changed in me
since I met you.</i>

01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:14.873
<i>I'd never experienced anything like this.
I can't write that article now.</i>

01:25:15.083 --> 01:25:18.326
<i>I might get fired,
so, on top of all, we'll be poor.</i>

01:25:19.416 --> 01:25:22.830
<i>Among all the impossible loves,
I chose you.</i>

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.163
<i>I don't know what happened to us,
but it happened.</i>

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.788
<i>I don't know what came up,
but it came up.</i>

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:33.202
<i>Love is strange.
I don't want to waste even a second.</i>

01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:36.329
<i>I would die
for a fistful of your kisses.</i>

01:25:37.208 --> 01:25:39.450
<i>Would you give me
another chance?</i>

01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:41.498
<i>Dani.</i>

01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:01.283
This isn't working, is it?

01:26:01.375 --> 01:26:03.037
No.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:06.118
- Is it me?
<i>- No.</i>

01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:09.748
Then, I don't get it.

01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:13.623
Say something, I don't know...

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.282
Is there another woman?

01:26:18.208 --> 01:26:19.870
Was there another woman?

01:26:22.541 --> 01:26:24.203
And it's not your ex.

01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:26.082
No.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.162
You're a bastard, you know.

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:38.165
Was she good?

01:26:40.875 --> 01:26:42.537
What do you mean?

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.116
Sex.

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:48.157
I didn't get to touch her.

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.913
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:58.039
I can't picture you as the romantic guy
living the impossible love story.

01:26:58.541 --> 01:27:01.204
- You're not that type.
- It wasn't impossible.

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:06.372
- So what happened?
- I was an idiot.

01:27:08.666 --> 01:27:10.908
You had her, but you let her go.

01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:13.082
Yes.

01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:15.157
Did you love her?

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:18.369
Very much.

01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:24.953
Then, yes...

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.037
You are a romantic.

01:27:28.916 --> 01:27:31.374
I guess
that's what I liked about you.

01:27:32.666 --> 01:27:35.079
I would have liked this to work.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.241
Me too.

01:27:39.041 --> 01:27:40.577
Take care.

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:07.039
- Hello, Lidia, what's up?
- Hey, you don't answer my calls!

01:28:07.125 --> 01:28:10.118
<i>Yeah, I was in a meeting, sorry.
What's up?</i>

01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:13.155
- What about dinner next Saturday?
- OK.

01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:16.414
<i>- If you have a date...</i>
- No, I don't have a date.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.208
<i>I mean if you have a "date",
you can bring her too.</i>

01:28:19.291 --> 01:28:22.159
Right. No, I don't have
any date of that kind either.

01:28:24.041 --> 01:28:26.078
Hey, listen...

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:36.332
I'm pregnant.

01:28:37.125 --> 01:28:38.332
What?

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:43.290
You heard well.

01:28:45.125 --> 01:28:46.707
<i>But...</i>

01:28:47.166 --> 01:28:49.783
<i>But did you go for it?</i>

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.743
No, not at all.
The pill failed and...

01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:56.745
But it's OK.

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.742
Well, I'm a bit scared.

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:05.701
Shit! You're pregnant!
I can't believe it!

01:29:07.666 --> 01:29:10.875
I've been thinking
about many things and...

01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:14.492
I think you should talk to her.

01:29:18.083 --> 01:29:20.450
Did you hear what I told you?

01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:23.750
Yes, I heard.
I always do.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.789
- See you on Saturday at home, then.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:29:27.875 --> 01:29:29.491
<i>See you on Saturday.</i>

01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:12.873
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:18.199
- Yes?
<i>- He waited for hours. He just left.</i>

01:32:19.958 --> 01:32:23.201
- How do you know...?
<i>- Does it matter?</i>

01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:27.535
<i>Every time I saw you together,
I felt love was in the air.</i>

01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:31.538
<i>Hurry up
and you'll catch up with him.</i>

01:32:54.708 --> 01:32:56.165
Dani!

01:33:00.916 --> 01:33:03.624
- I love you.
- That's enough.
