[Chuck] You've been
with him longer than

00:10.803 --> 00:12.346
you've been with me.
You and Axe --

00:12.346 --> 00:16.475
that's deep,
and I fucking hate it.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.936
[Hall]
I've got a source, a janitor.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.147
That's as high as I can
nail down so far,

00:21.147 --> 00:22.648
but he's already coming through.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
I'm gonna get you back from
Eastern and make you happy.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.319
-I'd like to be happy.
-[Bryan] Got this made

00:27.319 --> 00:29.697
'cause I was
so fucking proud of Chuck

00:29.697 --> 00:31.740
for pushing back.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.159
You know I didn't drive
all the way up here to Westport

00:33.159 --> 00:35.161
to give out "attaboys."

00:35.161 --> 00:37.997
Had to bring the kick ass...
with love.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.125
Bad day. Something happened.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.543
-But I'll fix it.
-Wendy?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.795
-You can't trust her.
-I need an adjustment.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.755
You're finally ready
for a real session.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.091
-I take care of my people...
[gunshots]

00:48.091 --> 00:50.593
same as when Mick Danzig
gets tackled on his lawn

00:50.593 --> 00:52.428
with a machine gun
in his fucking hands.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.180
I'm the one
who pays off the cops

00:54.180 --> 00:58.143
to make the problem go away.
That's what I do here.

00:58.143 --> 01:00.228
Took me apart,
put me together again.

Mm. [gasps] Red!

01:08.903 --> 01:11.197
You didn't get permission
from Wendy?

01:11.197 --> 01:13.032
She's intractable.

-â™ª Sometimes I'm right â™ª
[door closes]

01:57.284 --> 01:59.912
â™ª And I can be wrong â™ª

01:59.912 --> 02:03.165
â™ª My own beliefs
are in my song â™ª

02:03.165 --> 02:07.086
I woke your assistant and made
her tell me where you were.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.129
I need to have her fired.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.299
That's what I'd do,
but you're nicer than me.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.341
That I am.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.717
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:13.717 --> 02:17.179
Our comp meeting
will happen as scheduled.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.597
Your bonus will reflect

02:18.597 --> 02:21.058
your overall contribution
to the firm, as always.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.351
â™ª I... â™ª

02:22.351 --> 02:24.853
But I needed to do
something else for you...

02:24.853 --> 02:26.231
â™ª Everyday people â™ª

02:26.231 --> 02:27.773
...after what you did
for me the other night.

02:27.773 --> 02:31.068
[inhales sharply]
Something special.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.153
-That's for you.
-Axe.

This is

â™ª We got to live together â™ª

â™ª We are the same... â™ª

03:00.472 --> 03:02.225
After our session,

03:02.225 --> 03:05.269
I had the sudden clarity
that we were ready,

03:05.269 --> 03:06.812
that I was ready.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.023
-â™ª You can't figure out... â™ª
-Go get 'em.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.233

â™ª Yeah, yeah â™ª

03:18.241 --> 03:20.659
...looking at you,
that you're ready.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.537

At least...not yet.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.318
-Ah.
-Welcome back, Lonnie.

03:53.318 --> 03:55.027
-Can't thank you enough. [sighs]
-Mm-hmm.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.112

03:57.112 --> 03:58.739
-Please.
-Excellent.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.412
[door creaks]
-[Chuck] Uh...

04:04.412 --> 04:05.329
Don't even unpack.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.956
I've got an assignment
that has to happen now.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.249
I'm listening.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.543
There's a tip that I need you
to bird dog for me.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.253
Well, I'm birdy as
a springer spaniel.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.254
What is it?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.925
Criminal behavior perpetrated
by Bobby Axelrod.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.927
I thought the office got
that case pulled.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.429
Well, this case
would be different.

04:21.429 --> 04:25.265
It's not white collar.
Uh, federal firearms.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.350
Bribery.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.352
[exhales deeply]
That's a monster.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.396
Yeah.
It can't be tied to me.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.316
-Ah. [exhales deeply]
-Yeah.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.109
Start in Greenwich.

but again...

04:42.783 --> 04:45.703
[pen clatters]
-...leave me out of it, Lonnie.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.287
[pen cap clicks]
-Yeah. I'll jump right in,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.540
keep your involvement

04:49.540 --> 04:51.959
[paper rustles]
-Very good.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.419
[vehicles passing]

04:53.419 --> 04:55.087
[Wags] Why do I have
to carry this shit?

04:55.087 --> 04:58.006
[Bobby] I'm not gonna carry it.
You know the drill.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.633
Principal comes in
unburdened,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.760
free but for
his brilliant ideas.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.846
And the COO -- he lugs the books
like a schoolboy with a crush.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.806
There's no reason to
even have these books.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.058
This info can fit
on the flash drive.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.643
Do you know
why we wear ties?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.353
To signify seriousness
of purpose.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.813
-[sighs]
-Ours is not to question why,

05:12.813 --> 05:13.981
-...but to do, if...
[horn honks ]

05:13.981 --> 05:17.192
...like the schoolboy,
we want our kiss.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.531
Roller coasters are great
at an amusement park.

05:21.531 --> 05:23.031
-I love 'em.
[horns honking in distance]

05:23.031 --> 05:25.117
The ups and downs are what
make it worth riding.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.785
Not so much in
an investment vehicle.

05:26.785 --> 05:31.331
Unlike a roller coaster,
our returns only go up.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.542
[binder thudding]

05:33.542 --> 05:37.838
But your life, Axe...
[chuckles] The fund's profile.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.423
You went from managing
10 billion in outside money

05:39.423 --> 05:40.674
to half that.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.553
-[man] All of it yours.
-That's true.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.929
A year like that makes you
question everything.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.598
Makes you find new answers, too.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.892
What'd you figure out?

05:49.892 --> 05:51.977
That it's all about my why.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.812
[clatter]
-[sighs] I don't get to think

05:53.812 --> 05:56.899
about business
in such an esoteric manner.

05:56.899 --> 06:00.486
I have to evaluate risk,
reward, return. That's it.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.572
And to that end...
[sighs]

06:02.572 --> 06:03.906
my people have
a few questions.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.532
Your Sharpe Ratio's very low.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.452
How does an idea turn into
an investment at your shop?

06:08.452 --> 06:10.871
[man] What's your
mosaic theory at Axe Capital?

06:10.871 --> 06:14.374
Fees from funds like ours
used to pay your overhead.

06:14.374 --> 06:18.629
How are you dealing with
floating it all yourself?

06:18.629 --> 06:21.840
I can't allow myself
to care about that.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.468
What I do care about

06:23.468 --> 06:27.846
is making decisions to benefit
a greater number of people.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.600
Now when I'm only working
for myself or my staff,

06:30.600 --> 06:32.726
I'm sharp enough.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.230
[pops lips] But when I'm making
decisions for you  as well as me,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.732
that's when I'm twice
as careful, twice as focused,

06:38.732 --> 06:43.278
because I cannot live with
losing somebody else's money.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.863
That's my why.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.740
Have you had your Carter Staley
meeting yet?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.116
Is he allocating to you?

06:48.116 --> 06:50.035
[horn honks, vehicles passing]

06:50.035 --> 06:51.370
He's a lemming.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.497
soon as you net one major
allocator, he'll be in.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.249
He was supposed to be
the major allocator

06:55.249 --> 06:56.667
that would make the others
comfortable.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.544
We just one need domino.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.546
[siren wailing in distance]

07:00.546 --> 07:02.130
[man] Yeah. Greenwich PD.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.509
[indistinct conversations,
door squeaks]

07:04.509 --> 07:06.636
Thank you for bringing
that in, Robin.

07:06.636 --> 07:07.761
[Robin] My pleasure, sir.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.429
Duty rosters for
the last several months,

07:09.429 --> 07:12.391
along with vacations times
and radio call log.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.433
[pages rustling]

07:13.433 --> 07:14.685
If your subpoenas
are in order,

07:14.685 --> 07:16.228
would you mind telling me
what you're looking for?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.855
[pages continue rustling]
-Yes.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.483
[paper flutters]
-Yes, I mind telling you.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.359
[papers continue rustling]

07:22.359 --> 07:25.028
[woman] So you are that
confident you can get back

07:25.028 --> 07:26.656
to the numbers you were at.

07:26.656 --> 07:29.157
[Bobby] No doubt. I have
meetings lined up all week.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.450
Terrific.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.036
-[woman] Is Staley aboard yet?
-Not yet.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.121
Doesn't matter.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.498
I'd be thrilled
to be first money in.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.458
Wunderbar.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.752
[clatter]

07:40.752 --> 07:43.130
-[Wags] Another whiff.
-[Bobby] Yep.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.090
If it's that's easy,
you know they're not coming in.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.301
Nope.
Just there for the story.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.762
"Axe pitched me.
How the mighty have fallen."

07:50.762 --> 07:53.098
We gotta close Carter Staley.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.933
[door handle clicks]

07:54.933 --> 07:56.518
[feet thud]

08:01.315 --> 08:03.901
[man] Officer Salter responded
to a disturbance call

08:03.901 --> 08:05.402
at the Danzig residence

08:05.402 --> 08:08.488
but found no reason to pursue
matters with Mr. Danzig.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.616
My client has
nothing further to say.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.409
We're going to be interviewing
the rest of the shift

08:12.409 --> 08:13.744
that was on that night.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.705
I'm gonna make it very clear
to them.

08:15.705 --> 08:18.165
Cooperation
results in candy canes.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.083
Obfuscation will get you coal.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.545
Now let's talk about
this vacation

08:22.545 --> 08:25.590
your client took
to Vanuatu in early September.

08:25.590 --> 08:28.133
-What was the purpose --
-Recreation.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.010
If you want to lodge
formal charges,

08:30.010 --> 08:31.511
let's rock and roll.
Otherwise, you --

08:31.511 --> 08:34.723
Don't you worry. We're about
to rock like Cameo in '86.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.521
-...when they fucking ask them.
[horns honking in distance]

08:41.521 --> 08:44.358
Like Agassi in his prime.
The dam is gonna break soon.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.234
I don't need the Coach K
bullshit right now.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.111
Well, what do you need?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.947
Not sure. Something.

08:49.947 --> 08:53.450
[engines rumbling]

08:53.450 --> 08:57.621
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

08:57.621 --> 08:59.581
Throw those books aside.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.542
No, take those books,
go back to the office,

09:02.542 --> 09:03.961
and I'll see you after.

[jacket rustles and thuds]

09:21.770 --> 09:24.231
Here's how simple it is.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.652
I've outperformed the S&P
by 38.7%

09:27.652 --> 09:29.444
over the past 15 years.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.989
But that's not at issue here.

09:31.989 --> 09:36.576
The issue is the turmoil,

09:36.576 --> 09:40.790
the aspersions cast
on my fund and me.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.833
I'm talking about 9/11,

09:42.833 --> 09:44.794
arrests,

09:44.794 --> 09:47.504
whether I run a clean shop.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.881
And I understand that.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.467
In your shoes,

09:52.467 --> 09:54.094
I'd factor it in, too.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.387
But I'd also factor in

09:55.387 --> 09:57.973
the true cost
of missed opportunity.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.475
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

10:00.475 --> 10:02.978
In the span of...say, what?
A year?

10:02.978 --> 10:06.273
Nobody's gonna give a shit
about any of that.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.984
But the growth that you will
have missed out on?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.944
That's gonna eat you
from the inside.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.322
In a year's time,
I'd be happy to revisit.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.574
In a year's time,

10:15.574 --> 10:17.617
you're not gonna be able
to get me on the phone.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.953
When I walk out that door today,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.997
we are friends for life,

10:21.997 --> 10:25.250
or you don't exist to me
ever again.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.462
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

10:28.462 --> 10:31.465
I'm about to go on

10:31.465 --> 10:33.801
I am aligned. I feel it.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.762
And I know you can see it.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.765
I'm here,
but in ten seconds,

10:39.765 --> 10:42.100

11:00.827 --> 11:02.704
Can't imagine how the bonus

11:02.704 --> 11:04.247
if it went the other way.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.582
-[Bryan] Welcome back.
-[Lonnie] Good to see you.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.958
Good to see you, man.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.877
So...[exhales] wanted to hit
the ground running,

11:08.877 --> 11:12.422
but wanted you guys looped in
on what I'm working -- Axelrod.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.300

extracurricular crimes.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.593

11:17.928 --> 11:19.764
[exhales deeply]

11:19.764 --> 11:21.723
Yeah, I got a pair of,
uh, Greenwich cops

11:21.723 --> 11:23.183
with links to an Axelrod PM

11:23.183 --> 11:25.894
taking a vacation to Vanuatu
a little while back.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.938
Yeah, you know who
vacations there? No one.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.941
Oh, that place is a haven
for offshore banking.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.277
Wait, you think these cops went
to visit their payoff money?

11:34.277 --> 11:35.779
Set up their accounts?

11:35.779 --> 11:37.322
Yeah, I had 'em turn
their heads and cough,

11:37.322 --> 11:38.866
and they didn't give
anything up,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.951
but... [inhales sharply]
once the money's been tracked,

11:40.951 --> 11:42.744
they won't have a choice.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.412
I'll e-mail you guys
what I have.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.872
-This could really be something.
-[Lonnie] Yeah.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.874
-How'd you step into it?
-On a hunch. [sighs]

11:47.874 --> 11:49.459
I reviewed arrest records
of all Axe Capital --

11:49.459 --> 11:51.211
There were no arrests.
We checked.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.673
Right. So then I looked into
the suspicious activity reports

11:54.673 --> 11:56.716
in the Greenwich PD's
dispatch log.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.927
Found a few that raised
a red flag that hadn't gone

11:58.927 --> 12:00.053
all the way through
the system.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.097
Huh. [inhales deeply]

12:02.097 --> 12:04.349
That's some fucking hunch.

Okay, you went this far,

12:49.269 --> 12:51.771
You have a problem.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.484
I do.

And it worked.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.369

about it, would you?

and can trace it...

14:03.551 --> 14:06.680
They cannot trace the funds
back to us. Yet.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.473

then one of the cops

Yes.

15:22.088 --> 15:26.301
It would be best if you
continue on with her as is,

takes away any middle ground
between right and wrong

Just so you know, and...

18:59.055 --> 19:00.390
[lock turns]

19:00.390 --> 19:02.475
I wanna be clear

I have your web traffic
on our server here,

19:17.115 --> 19:18.741
and from your laptop.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.618
You got quite a dark side,
don't you?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.996
I would imagine this
would make

19:22.996 --> 19:25.957
Dr. Wendy Rhoades
look very unprofessional.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.834
And, of course,
the whole world,

19:27.834 --> 19:30.212
including the office
of the US Attorney

19:30.212 --> 19:33.006
for the Southern District,
and the Attorney General,

19:33.006 --> 19:34.591
would see it, too.

19:34.591 --> 19:38.052
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

19:38.052 --> 19:39.512
It's funny.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.223
[file rustles]

19:41.223 --> 19:43.016
I never instructed my man
to take these

when he set up the baths,
but...

19:45.394 --> 19:47.228
[paper rustles]
-I suppose on, uh,

19:47.228 --> 19:51.399
on some deep level,
I knew he would.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.775
[picture rustles]

19:52.775 --> 19:54.068
And you,

19:54.068 --> 19:57.196
being such a master
of the subconscious...

19:57.196 --> 19:59.032
or is that mistress?

19:59.032 --> 20:00.700
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

20:00.700 --> 20:03.411
I suppose you
would've known, too.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

20:04.787 --> 20:08.333
[inhales sharply]

20:08.333 --> 20:11.085
-Polygraph me, motherfucker.
[papers thud]

20:11.085 --> 20:13.046
I tell you about my issues
with Danzig,

20:13.046 --> 20:16.424
and then in, ooh,
the space of, what, 48 hours,

20:16.424 --> 20:19.385
there's a fucking investigation
underway!

20:35.277 --> 20:37.820
It's lovely.
[inhales sharply]

20:37.820 --> 20:40.948
For people in our...
situation,

20:40.948 --> 20:42.367
which would you recommend?

20:42.367 --> 20:43.993
Well, you can pick a school
based on the villa

20:43.993 --> 20:45.329
or vice versa.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.457
I have a packet of
all those options for you.

20:48.457 --> 20:50.166
And the timing can work
as we've planned?

20:50.166 --> 20:53.044
Yes. These particular
schools are used

20:53.044 --> 20:55.254
to business people's children
coming and going

20:55.254 --> 20:56.798
for a variety of reasons.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.758
Will you be enrolling them
under their real names?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.303
What?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.596
Some don't. The stigma.

21:03.596 --> 21:07.308
They want their kids to have
a clean run at their new lives.

21:07.308 --> 21:12.021
We can provide fresh passports
for all of you.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.564
No.

aren't always yours.

You and the children,

21:28.579 --> 21:30.832
you don't have to go.

21:30.832 --> 21:33.376
But are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

21:33.376 --> 21:35.294
Because you know
you can't come back.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.548
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

21:38.548 --> 21:41.551

22:09.912 --> 22:13.583
I'm just saying I miss
the burger, Bryan.

22:13.583 --> 22:17.003
It's what you're not saying

22:17.003 --> 22:19.255

-[sighs]
-Dude.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.968
Are you okay?

22:23.968 --> 22:26.179
Uh, I'm kind of...

22:26.179 --> 22:28.765
fucked up, honestly.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.767
That makes sense.

22:30.767 --> 22:34.479
Here's what makes sense.
You didn't...stumble upon

22:34.479 --> 22:36.439
this Danzig-Axelrod thing.

22:36.439 --> 22:39.776
Someone fed it to you.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.404
I've developed sources.
One came through. Yes.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.698

22:49.952 --> 22:53.080
[scoffs] At exactly
the right time for you

22:55.374 --> 22:57.168
Look...

22:57.168 --> 22:59.128
[smacks lips] I understand
how you're feeling

22:59.128 --> 23:01.214
with everything
you've put into this.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.299
But we can work together.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.842
We can share the win.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.886
â™ª Well, I'm down on my luck â™ª

23:06.886 --> 23:09.597
[inhales sharply] Chuck's
the one who gave it to you.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.684
He got it somehow, and he's
using you as his shill.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.521
All right, check yourself,
right now,

23:16.521 --> 23:18.064
before you come at me
with some bullshit

23:18.064 --> 23:20.691

from happening,

one look into my eyes

23:40.462 --> 23:44.632

that I had it any easier.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.656
I know what you did.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.119
I don't believe this.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.663
Everything I've done,
no matter what,

24:57.663 --> 24:59.415
is for us.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.751
I don't believe that,
not anymore.

25:01.751 --> 25:04.003
Not after you broke
into my computer,

25:04.003 --> 25:07.089
opened my files,
and read my session notes.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.883
You stole the evidence
you needed.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.552
I had no choice.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.347
We all have choices.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.514
That's right.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.392
That's right,
and I'd do it again.

25:18.392 --> 25:19.644
[footsteps]

Because even if you
can't put together

25:20.978 --> 25:23.105
what he's done to us,
I can.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.191
And that gives you the right
to break into my computer?

25:25.191 --> 25:26.484
If you give someone
your password, is it really

25:26.484 --> 25:27.818
-...breaking in?
-Yes, it is.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.820
Do not come at me with another
word of lawyer bullshit.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.156
You can talk yourself into
any kind of justification.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.659
Sure. Yeah.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.535
But, you know, it's no worse
than you and your,

25:36.535 --> 25:39.163
"I'm there for my patients"
bullshit,

25:39.163 --> 25:41.916
because these patients
that you see are criminals.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.417
That's the point.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.544
[chair creaks]

25:45.544 --> 25:48.881
And all the proof I could ever
need is in that computer.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.883
In my own house.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.052
I know this much

25:53.052 --> 25:55.096
You can't use
what you found there.

25:55.096 --> 25:57.056
It's privileged
and inadmissible.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.599
And if you do
and you're caught,

25:58.599 --> 26:00.476
I won't lie

No. I wasn't there to spy.

Uh, it was to talk to you.

'Cause I'm desperate, Wendy.

I wasn't up there
because of the case.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.148
It was personal.

This man, this motherfucker,

26:49.358 --> 26:52.779
is destroying our lives.

deliberately.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.617
-No.
-[scoffs]

26:58.617 --> 27:01.788
You are.
He is an outside factor.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.957
This problem  is here.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.168
You could've walked away
from this a million times.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.836
-You told me you had.
-I can't.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.213
It's not that simple.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.883
Even this, uh, the reason
we're here right now

27:13.883 --> 27:15.551
having this conversation,

27:15.551 --> 27:17.846
he knew that I was acting
on the bribery

27:17.846 --> 27:19.555
before anyone could've
known it.

27:19.555 --> 27:23.810
He  will not let  me
just walk away.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.771
He will not stop
until he ruins me.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.230
Now you sound like
a crazy person.

27:28.230 --> 27:32.193
He had me followed,
all right?

27:32.193 --> 27:34.528
'Cause he's trying to trip me
up, he's trying to trap me.

27:34.528 --> 27:37.031
So I had to play dirty
right back at him.

27:37.031 --> 27:38.783
[inhales deeply]
Followed? Where?

27:38.783 --> 27:41.118

saw you and Axe together,

27:55.883 --> 27:59.220
I got very worked up,

27:59.220 --> 28:01.847
past the point of, uh...
[scoffs]

28:04.016 --> 28:05.769
[clicks teeth]
I went to see Troy.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.856
â™ª tense music â™ª

28:09.856 --> 28:13.735
And like I said, he had
someone on me and, uh...

28:13.735 --> 28:15.903
well, if I didn't get lucky,
there would be pictures

28:15.903 --> 28:19.240

of today's Post.  [sniffles]

28:19.240 --> 28:22.326
[scoffs]

28:22.326 --> 28:24.954
You went to see her
without fucking tell me.

28:24.954 --> 28:28.499
-Nothing happened.
-[scoffs and laughs]

28:28.499 --> 28:31.252
And I couldn't go through with
anything anyway because, uh...

28:31.252 --> 28:32.503
[hand thuds]

28:32.503 --> 28:34.547
[sighs]
Because you weren't there.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.923
[scoffs] How touching.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.299
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

28:37.299 --> 28:39.844
I'm cut off.

28:39.844 --> 28:44.808
I'm cut off from you,
from us. [inhales sharply]

28:44.808 --> 28:47.143
And you sit there and you try
to claim moral high ground.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.477
Oh, oh, oh, oh. I claim  it?

28:48.477 --> 28:50.814
While you go on working
at a criminal organization,

28:50.814 --> 28:54.525
and you can't even fucking
admit it to yourself, Wendy.

28:54.525 --> 28:57.153
[exhales sharply]

28:57.153 --> 28:58.946
And you prop it up

28:58.946 --> 29:01.783
and you suck in
all that it gives you --

29:01.783 --> 29:04.410
status, money, control.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.870
You know what? It gives me
a hell of a lot more

29:05.870 --> 29:08.706
than you do,
including  honesty!

29:08.706 --> 29:10.916
[laughs] Really?

29:10.916 --> 29:13.419
[chair creaks, footsteps]

29:13.419 --> 29:16.130
What? Like this? [whistles]

29:16.130 --> 29:17.506
-How'd you earn...
[keys clatter]

29:17.506 --> 29:19.383
...that new hunk of metal
that's parked outside?

29:19.383 --> 29:20.885
What's that worth?
A quarter mil?

29:20.885 --> 29:22.428
I don't know.
I didn't have it appraised.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.221
[laughs] You know,
what you should be appraising

29:24.221 --> 29:27.183
is your conscience.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.101
'Cause you can lie to me
about how it makes you feel,

29:29.101 --> 29:31.270
but you can't lie
to yourself.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.773
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

29:34.773 --> 29:37.067
And if you're right there
in the middle of it

29:37.067 --> 29:39.320
with a bunch of criminals,

29:39.320 --> 29:42.198
what do you think
that makes you?

29:42.198 --> 29:45.201
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

29:46.410 --> 29:47.745
[keys clatter]

29:47.745 --> 29:49.496
You don't get to ask me
that question anymore.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.208
I am going to take a walk.
Pack your shit.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.376
[clatter]
-When I get back,

29:54.376 --> 29:56.462
be gone.

[bag thuds]

30:54.062 --> 30:55.646
[door closes]

30:57.439 --> 30:58.691
Good news, boss.

30:58.691 --> 31:01.110
Uh, banking authorities
in Vanuatu have revealed

31:01.110 --> 31:03.487
that our cops have
significant holdings there.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.863
It's gonna take some time --

31:04.863 --> 31:06.573
these fuckers are not
cooperative --

31:06.573 --> 31:08.534
before we find that source
of the funds,

31:08.534 --> 31:10.327
but we know what
we're going to find.

31:10.327 --> 31:13.247
[sighs] Case is terminated.
[fingers tapping chair]

31:16.959 --> 31:19.962

31:21.422 --> 31:23.215
What the fuck is going on?

31:27.636 --> 31:31.598
[clicks teeth] Looked like
a winner, but it's not.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.560
[clicks teeth]
'Cause there is no gun.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.103
Uh, there will never be a gun.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.355
[scoffs]

31:38.355 --> 31:39.606
[sighs]

31:39.606 --> 31:41.984
That's good legwork, Lonnie.
Thank you.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.820
But I don't want you
burning out your legs

31:44.820 --> 31:46.780
chasing another ghost.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

31:58.876 --> 32:00.294
[clicks teeth] Okay.

32:02.964 --> 32:05.215

It's Chinatown, Jake.

Been here a while?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.127
Yes.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.008
I didn't expect you back
so soon after how you left.

[Wendy] I don't believe that,
not anymore,

32:53.430 --> 32:57.185
not after you broke into
my computer, opened my files,

32:57.185 --> 32:59.187
-...read my session notes...
-Jesus.

32:59.187 --> 33:00.229
You stole the evidence
you needed.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.022
[Chuck] I had no choice.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.485
[touchscreen clicks]

33:06.485 --> 33:08.070
[Chuck]
'Cause you can lie to me

33:08.070 --> 33:10.864
about how it makes you feel,
but you can't lie to yourself.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.408
And if you're right there
in the middle of it,

33:12.408 --> 33:14.326
with a bunch of criminals,

33:14.326 --> 33:16.912
what do you think
that makes you?

33:18.455 --> 33:21.500
That's a hell of a question
to have to answer.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.212
I know.

33:26.047 --> 33:29.967
[footsteps scuffle]

33:29.967 --> 33:33.179
I am so sorry
to have doubted you.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.388
This is the part where you
tell me you're gonna destroy

33:34.388 --> 33:36.306
everything you showed me,
right?

33:36.306 --> 33:38.475
I will destroy
all copies of it,

33:38.475 --> 33:40.477
whether you believe me
or not.

33:40.477 --> 33:43.021
What else are you
prepared to do?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.068
[feet shuffle]

33:47.068 --> 33:48.777
Your bonus.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.239
I was planning to
give you two million.

33:51.239 --> 33:52.489
It just went up to five.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.033
How do I know you mean it,

33:55.033 --> 33:56.160
that I won't walk down
to my office

33:56.160 --> 33:57.536
and find it's one million

33:57.536 --> 34:00.038
and another four you're keeping
invested here for me?

34:00.038 --> 34:03.041
I'll wire it to you now,
to your own account.

34:17.265 --> 34:18.348
I will.

34:18.348 --> 34:20.517
[clicks teeth] I'll triple it
for that recording

34:20.517 --> 34:22.144
you played me just now.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.312
[exhales]

34:23.312 --> 34:26.107
It's worth that much to you?

34:26.107 --> 34:28.901
Consider that
my opening offer.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.491
He's still the father
of my kids.

[cell phone buzzes]

34:47.253 --> 34:52.216
I quit, Bobby. Chuck was
right about one thing.

-I can't be in denial about...
[clatter]

34:54.218 --> 34:58.096
...what this place is,
what you are, any longer.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.850
Not after
what you showed me.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.311
I know you trade
on inside information

35:04.311 --> 35:07.606
and by other illegal means.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.316
Or you let it be done
for you.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.567
You encourage it.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.361
Are you taping me  now?

35:12.361 --> 35:14.821
No.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.325
I just need to hear
myself say it.

35:17.325 --> 35:19.117
Look, I can explain --

35:19.117 --> 35:21.411
Good luck with that...

35:21.411 --> 35:24.165

I get it. But let's
channel that, shall we?

37:16.818 --> 37:21.448
How did you know that Tara Mohr
was leaking information?

37:21.448 --> 37:23.241
She just felt wrong.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.620
She was always just around,

Gone.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.379
For good, I think.

39:03.551 --> 39:05.553
Well, it's for the best,
you know.

39:05.553 --> 39:08.388
She outlived her utility
as a weather vane

39:08.388 --> 39:10.474
of what her husband
was gonna do.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.393

[rustling]

39:21.109 --> 39:22.611
Look at this.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.404
There was a time
when this was more than

39:24.404 --> 39:28.700
we ever could've imagined
having, you know?

39:28.700 --> 39:33.246
We'd always talk about
doing without, living simple.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.790
Hard to think about
going back.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.042
[chuckles] Yeah.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.461
Really is.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.514

39:50.514 --> 39:51.598
You never know.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.239
[Kate] That's him.

40:07.239 --> 40:11.076
African-American gentlemen,
Jefferies, Clement. Age 62.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.830
Okay. Let's see if we can
Tinker Tailor his ass.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.081
[telephone ringing in distance]

40:16.081 --> 40:17.458
[door closes]

40:19.000 --> 40:20.669
-[Chuck] Dale.
-Sir?

40:20.669 --> 40:22.754
The team needs the latest
on our Axe Capital wire.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.048
I need the latest on
the wire myself bec--

40:25.048 --> 40:27.425
Don't answer me back.
Conveying the intel is your job.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.593
The FBI can't put
those wires up

40:28.593 --> 40:29.970
and then not share
on the comeback.

40:29.970 --> 40:33.056
Sir, all due respect,
I'm awfully confused.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.891
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll straighten it all out.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.644
I'll book a meeting
with you and Terri.

40:37.644 --> 40:40.772
[pats back]
-[Chuck sighs heavily]

[lid clatters]

40:47.612 --> 40:50.240
[indistinct conversations]

40:53.285 --> 40:55.621
What are you eating?

40:55.621 --> 40:56.496
[door closes]
-Nothing.

40:56.496 --> 40:58.957
Not here.
Too good to pass up.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.208
Bruno, what's hot?

41:00.208 --> 41:02.419
I got a fresh nonna pie
and a hot pepperoni.

41:02.419 --> 41:03.587
Nonna pie.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.131
[footsteps]

41:06.131 --> 41:08.633
-Hey.
[pan clatters]

41:08.633 --> 41:10.844
[rubs palms]
-Enjoy, eh?

41:10.844 --> 41:12.470
[keys jingle]

41:12.470 --> 41:14.472
And lock up
when youse are done.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.765
Good night, Bruno.

41:18.768 --> 41:20.228
[door bells jingle]

41:31.698 --> 41:32.949
[plate thuds]

41:32.949 --> 41:34.534
Okay. Now what?

41:34.534 --> 41:36.119
[napkin rustles]

41:36.119 --> 41:39.623
I don't wanna ruin your appetite
just as you started digging in,

41:39.623 --> 41:42.668
but... [sighs] I need to
tell you that your boss got

41:42.668 --> 41:46.547
that bogus information
on Axe and the cops

41:46.547 --> 41:49.592
by accessing
his wife's private notes.

41:53.470 --> 41:54.597
Fuck!

41:54.597 --> 41:56.264
Right.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.683
[sighs heavily]

41:57.683 --> 42:00.018
I'm sure by now
he's dropped it.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.439
He has.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.525
[inhales deeply]
Then my part is done for now.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.532
Oh, what the fuck? Come on.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.785
Hang for a minute, Bryan.

42:16.785 --> 42:21.289
Listen to what Bobby
has to say.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.667
[keys jingle]

42:23.667 --> 42:25.085
I can't sit with you.

42:25.085 --> 42:27.545
-Sure, you can.
[keys clatter, door closes]

42:27.545 --> 42:30.298
-You want to.
[chair clatters]

42:30.298 --> 42:32.676
Same way you want to stare
at the lions at the zoo.

42:35.011 --> 42:36.930
[clicks teeth]
Bach walks around thinking

42:36.930 --> 42:39.265
he's better and smarter
than everyone.

42:39.265 --> 42:42.227
-And you know why?
-'Cause he is.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.561
That's right,

42:43.561 --> 42:47.357
only he says
you're just as smart.

42:47.357 --> 42:51.027
Even more focused,
younger, hungrier.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.404
Dangerous.

42:52.404 --> 42:54.280
[inhales deeply]

42:54.280 --> 42:56.491
I don't know
about any of that.

42:56.491 --> 42:57.701
I know hard work.

42:57.701 --> 43:00.704
Yeah, you work hard.

43:00.704 --> 43:03.957
But it's much more
than that.

43:03.957 --> 43:07.585
You're driven the way only
someone brought up from nothing,

43:07.585 --> 43:09.796
the way we were, can be.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.757
Chuck Rhoades,
for all his ambition,

43:12.757 --> 43:14.801
he can never need it
the way we do.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.345
But the guy's had
a safety net all his life.

43:17.345 --> 43:20.140
You and me?
We never had a fucking net.

43:22.892 --> 43:26.438
That's why
it can never work,

43:26.438 --> 43:30.400
in the long-term,
you under him...

43:31.776 --> 43:33.361
Because he can't understand

43:33.361 --> 43:35.280
what matters to you
the way I can.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.073
Hmm.

43:37.073 --> 43:39.993
[inhales deeply]

43:39.993 --> 43:43.496
I spend every minute
of my day

43:43.496 --> 43:45.123
going after guys like you.

43:45.123 --> 43:49.294
That attitude, that focus,
that ability --

43:49.294 --> 43:52.422
it's not being fostered
where you're at, is it?

43:52.422 --> 43:54.758
It's being thwarted,
in fact.

43:54.758 --> 43:57.302
And eventually...
[clicks teeth]

43:57.302 --> 43:58.678
what you're feeling

43:58.678 --> 44:01.765
will turn to disgust
and self-hatred,

44:01.765 --> 44:04.726
and in the end, apathy,

44:04.726 --> 44:05.977
if it hasn't already.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.229
Oh, that's your diagnosis?

44:08.229 --> 44:10.398
What's your cure?

44:10.398 --> 44:13.610
You know what it is.

44:13.610 --> 44:17.655
Come work for Bach's firm
on my account.

44:17.655 --> 44:21.618
â™ª pensive music â™ª

44:21.618 --> 44:22.827
It's a different kind
of integrity

44:22.827 --> 44:25.997
where at least you know
you're never lying to yourself.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.750
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

44:27.750 --> 44:30.043
I'm offering
challenging work.

44:30.043 --> 44:31.461
You'll be allowed to win --

44:31.461 --> 44:35.507
expected to,
on your own terms.

44:35.507 --> 44:38.093
And, of course,
you'll be rewarded.

44:38.093 --> 44:40.929
Seven figures, starting.

44:40.929 --> 44:44.891
And an ability to help
your family, really  help them.

44:44.891 --> 44:49.145
Your mom -- she won't have to
work so hard, not at all,

44:49.145 --> 44:52.733
unless she wants to.

44:52.733 --> 44:56.402
Time to take your seat
at the grown-ups' table.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.864
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

44:58.864 --> 45:00.323
[inhales deeply]

45:00.323 --> 45:02.742
That's not who I am.

45:02.742 --> 45:04.285
I can't picture it.

45:04.285 --> 45:06.704
Oh, I think you can
picture it now.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.748
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

45:08.748 --> 45:11.251
The Bryan Connerty at
the settlement conference --

45:11.251 --> 45:15.213
he would've stormed out of here
the moment I walked in.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.923
But you stayed,

45:16.923 --> 45:18.591
and you listened.

45:18.591 --> 45:21.302
Hmm.

45:21.302 --> 45:23.847
And like you said...
[inhales deeply]

45:23.847 --> 45:27.810
I stare at the lions
at the zoo, too.

45:27.810 --> 45:29.227
Doesn't mean
I wanna be one.

45:29.227 --> 45:33.898
Sure, it does.
Everyone wants to be a lion.

45:33.898 --> 45:38.027
Most people just never
get the chance.

45:38.027 --> 45:40.822
I'm offering you one now.

46:39.088 --> 46:40.715
Okay, get a sweep going now.

Already in progress.

Welcome to the club, sir.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.894
Chuck Rhoades.
We spoke earlier.

46:52.894 --> 46:55.438
As I said, I'm sorry, we don't
have any suites available

46:55.438 --> 46:56.857
on short notice.

46:56.857 --> 46:58.650
I'll let you know
as soon as one opens up.

48:18.438 --> 48:20.356
were thorough?

48:20.356 --> 48:22.985

every inch of the place.

48:22.985 --> 48:24.945
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

48:24.945 --> 48:26.279
So what do we do now?

48:26.279 --> 48:29.115
There's nothing more
we can  do on this level.

48:29.115 --> 48:31.701
[inhales sharply]
We can only go deeper.

48:31.701 --> 48:33.870
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

48:33.870 --> 48:36.956
Then go deeper.

We've gone
down to the rivets.

49:51.073 --> 49:54.033
I say there's nothing here.

Look at what you did
to this fucking place.

50:45.293 --> 50:49.464
I wonder what would've made you
feel you needed to do this.

50:49.464 --> 50:52.134
But you do know we were never
able to get a warrant to bug it.

50:52.134 --> 50:54.552
Oh, not having a warrant
wouldn't stop you.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.221
Or maybe there is one buried
in the ceiling somewhere.

50:57.221 --> 51:00.975
I can't --
I can't really remember.

51:37.386 --> 51:38.971
Oh, you should.

does more to contribute

51:40.890 --> 51:43.518
to a general sense of well-being
than almost anything else.

51:43.518 --> 51:45.394
Oh, yeah. No, of course.
I love to laugh.

51:45.394 --> 51:48.606
I'm not laughing now
is what I should've said.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.275
Oh, why is that?

51:50.275 --> 51:53.027
Because my wife
kicked me out.

51:53.027 --> 51:55.280
[clothes rustle]
-Good for her!

51:55.280 --> 51:57.156
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

51:57.156 --> 51:59.617
But she's not here either,

51:59.617 --> 52:01.285
if you're trying
to find her.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.287
[sighs]

52:03.287 --> 52:06.082
We've both lost her.

52:07.292 --> 52:09.211
Oh.

52:09.211 --> 52:12.463
Well, then maybe you have
a sliver of my pain,

52:12.463 --> 52:15.007
because you stripped away
everything that matters to me.

52:15.007 --> 52:17.134
You  came at  me!

52:17.134 --> 52:19.804
Because you're
a criminal, Bob.

52:19.804 --> 52:21.264
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

52:21.264 --> 52:25.227
And it's my job to shut 'em down
and put 'em in jail.

52:25.227 --> 52:28.688
Well, if that's true,
you're not very good at it.

52:28.688 --> 52:30.189
You're also full of shit.

52:30.189 --> 52:32.900
[footsteps scuffle]

52:32.900 --> 52:36.445
What have I done wrong?
Really?

52:36.445 --> 52:40.283
Except make money, succeed.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.076
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

52:42.076 --> 52:45.329
All these rules
and regulations -- arbitrary,

52:45.329 --> 52:48.249
chalked up by politicians
for their own ends.

52:48.249 --> 52:51.836
And these fines you're
always going after --

52:51.836 --> 52:55.339
Where do they go?
Who gets them? The poor? No.

52:55.339 --> 52:57.800
-The Treasury, the government.
-[sighs]

52:57.800 --> 53:00.720
It's taxation by other means.

53:00.720 --> 53:05.225
Save the civics lesson
and the Ayn Rand bullshit.

53:05.225 --> 53:08.019
The fines are the minimum of
what you should have to pay.

53:08.019 --> 53:09.396
Oh, you decide
what cases to take,

53:09.396 --> 53:12.064
and you only take
the cases you won't lose.

53:12.064 --> 53:14.275
But you got it wrong
with me,

53:14.275 --> 53:16.278
-...because this country...
-[sighs]

53:16.278 --> 53:19.071
...was built on industry
and competition.

53:19.071 --> 53:21.699
So they will always  have
a place for me.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.618
Oh.

53:23.618 --> 53:26.287
And maybe a few generations
from now,

53:26.287 --> 53:29.040
they'll tell stories
about you,

53:29.040 --> 53:30.417
-...like they do Jesse James...
-[chuckles]

53:30.417 --> 53:32.252
....or Billy the Kid.

53:32.252 --> 53:35.422
Oh, the myth is
so fuckin' romantic.

53:35.422 --> 53:37.131
The rugged individual
who won't back down

53:37.131 --> 53:41.303
to the unimaginative,
do-gooder authorities.

53:41.303 --> 53:43.888
Only in reality,
those guys stole and hurt

53:43.888 --> 53:45.264
and destroyed lives.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.476
Now you say you don't think
you've harmed anyone.

53:48.476 --> 53:50.645
I say that the effect
is the same, worse even,

53:50.645 --> 53:53.856
because you infect
the entire world.

53:53.856 --> 53:56.901
You throw the whole system
off balance,

53:56.901 --> 53:59.570
leaving chaos and poverty
in your wake.

53:59.570 --> 54:02.281
I make the system run.

54:02.281 --> 54:04.326
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

54:04.326 --> 54:07.662
I have contributed
hundreds of millions of dollars

54:07.662 --> 54:09.955
in taxes and philanthropy.

54:09.955 --> 54:13.376
[laughs]

54:13.376 --> 54:16.379
I am employ hundreds
of people directly,

54:16.379 --> 54:19.256
thousands indirectly.

54:19.256 --> 54:23.052
What do you do?

54:23.052 --> 54:25.096
Nothing...

54:25.096 --> 54:27.598
besides suck from
the municipality,

54:27.598 --> 54:29.642
feed off of it.

54:29.642 --> 54:33.104
And in exchange, you what?
Keep order?

54:33.104 --> 54:36.190
You're a traffic cop
hiding in federal robes.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.317
[pats chest]

54:38.317 --> 54:41.237
I'm moved.

54:41.237 --> 54:44.907
I am -- that is gonna play
huge to the other guys

54:44.907 --> 54:47.452
-...on your cell block.
-[chuckling]

54:47.452 --> 54:49.454
Oh, you're sure to become
President of the, uh,

54:49.454 --> 54:52.540
Libertarian Club
of Danbury Federal Prison.

54:52.540 --> 54:56.461
'Cause no matter what you say,
that's where you're ending up.

54:56.461 --> 54:58.713
Keep that as a memento.

54:58.713 --> 55:00.256
And every time
you look at it,

55:00.256 --> 55:02.550
know that deal is as good as
it is ever gonna get for you.

55:02.550 --> 55:04.927
And one day, you are gonna
wish like fucking hell

55:04.927 --> 55:06.470
that it was still
on the table.

55:06.470 --> 55:11.142
Then you should've kept
half of that for yourself, too.

55:11.142 --> 55:14.396
Because when I pull a deal
off the table,

55:14.396 --> 55:17.314
I leave Nagasaki behind.

55:17.314 --> 55:20.317
â™ª dramatic music â™ª

55:28.535 --> 55:29.577
[footsteps scuffle]

55:29.577 --> 55:31.829
You know the only enemy
more dangerous

55:31.829 --> 55:35.291
than a man
with unlimited resources...

55:37.377 --> 55:39.462
...is one
with nothing to lose.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.842
And that is what
you are looking at

55:44.842 --> 55:46.802
right here.

55:46.802 --> 55:49.805
[Titus Andronicus' "Dimed Out"

55:53.476 --> 55:56.479
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

55:59.482 --> 56:01.567
â™ª I used to like walking
with my eyes down â™ª

56:01.567 --> 56:04.403
â™ª I'd sleep all day and fret
away the night hours â™ª

56:04.403 --> 56:06.697
â™ª But then I saw the sun
and felt its light's power â™ª

56:06.697 --> 56:08.657
â™ª And I found out the planet
ain't no private house â™ª

56:08.657 --> 56:11.827
â™ª Now I turn a brave bully
to a shy coward â™ª

56:11.827 --> 56:14.121
â™ª I make a loud lout silent
as a quiet mouse â™ª

56:14.121 --> 56:16.791
â™ª Then I make them hand over
the white cloud â™ª

56:16.791 --> 56:19.293
â™ª And then they're leaving me
with a polite bow â™ª

â™ª And I've got plans
I haven't time to write down â™ª

56:21.879 --> 56:24.466
