00:09.999 --> 00:14.887
<i>Great leaders inspire
greatness in others.</i>

00:16.918 --> 00:18.568
<i>A galaxy, divided by war.</i>

00:20.352 --> 00:23.894
<i>Peaceful worlds must choose sides
or face the threat of invasion.</i>

00:24.154 --> 00:28.374
<i>Republic and Seperatist armies
vie for the allegiance of neutral planets.</i>

00:28.544 --> 00:31.361
<i>Desparate to build a Republic supply base
in the system of Toydaria...</i>

00:31.400 --> 00:36.539
<i>... Jedi Master Yoda travels to secret
negotiations on a remote neutral moon.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
{\a7}Rugosa
Outer Rim

00:42.940 --> 00:46.249
We are getting no signal from
the Republic, your heighness.

00:46.791 --> 00:48.341
I don't see anything.

00:48.431 --> 00:50.839
It is not like the Jedi
to be late.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.214
Greetings, King Katuunko.

00:58.668 --> 01:01.902
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger, majesty.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.417
My master wishes to speak with you.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.228
<i>Katuunko...</i>

01:08.853 --> 01:12.775
<i>... Great king of Toydaria,
forgive my intrusion.</i>

01:13.195 --> 01:14.235
Count Dooku.

01:14.700 --> 01:21.434
<i>I am aware Master Yoda hopes you will allow
the Jedi to build a Republic base in your system...</i>

01:21.436 --> 01:24.705
<i>... in exchange for protection,
correct?</i>

01:24.965 --> 01:27.099
Your spies serve you well, Count.

01:27.592 --> 01:31.185
<i>I ask,
how can the Jedi protect you...</i>

01:31.620 --> 01:34.673
<i>... if they cannot protect themselves?</i>

01:35.254 --> 01:38.884
Toydarian Royal Delegation, this is
the Republican envoy, please respond.

01:40.804 --> 01:43.347
General, the Toydarians' beacon is
active on the moon...

01:43.608 --> 01:46.183
... but all our transmissions
are being jammed.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.328
We caught them by surprise alright!

02:01.531 --> 02:02.697
We're losing our shields.

02:02.966 --> 02:05.036
Too late it is,
sprung is the trap.

02:09.417 --> 02:12.127
- I must get you to safety, General.
- Retreat you must...

02:13.089 --> 02:14.880
... on the moon below,
is my mission.

02:15.541 --> 02:17.090
There, I must go.

02:21.293 --> 02:24.222
I suppose you and your droid
armies can do better?

02:24.789 --> 02:26.244
<i>Without a doubt.</i>

02:26.414 --> 02:30.121
<i>I sense you are one who respects
strength, your heighness.</i>

02:30.541 --> 02:35.150
<i>Our droid armies outnumber
the Republic clones a hundred to one.</i>

02:35.554 --> 02:36.763
Perhaps...

02:37.166 --> 02:38.550
... but I have heard...

02:38.720 --> 02:42.232
... that a single Jedi
equals a hundred battle droids.

02:42.804 --> 02:46.036
Quickly now.
Reach the planets surface we must.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.538
In an escape pod, sir?

02:48.799 --> 02:50.497
The enemy will fire at
anything we launch.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.017
Then launch all of them,
you will.

03:00.291 --> 03:03.678
<i>Master Yoda's powers have
been greatly exaggerated.</i>

03:04.103 --> 03:06.348
That remains to be seen, Count.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.728
<i>Indeed.</i>

03:08.166 --> 03:10.443
<i>But when you decide to join us...</i>

03:10.794 --> 03:13.362
<i>... my apprentice will contact me.</i>

03:27.229 --> 03:28.912
Hang on,
almost...

03:32.980 --> 03:34.530
What a terrible shot.

03:34.918 --> 03:37.669
Ah, well,
it's my programming.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.348
That was a close one.

03:42.518 --> 03:44.219
General, I think we're out of range.

03:44.479 --> 03:45.714
I agree...

03:45.884 --> 03:47.889
... but entering another trap
we are.

03:49.776 --> 03:50.811
Are you sure?

03:50.981 --> 03:53.436
A disturbance in the Force,
there is.

03:57.834 --> 03:58.977
My Lord...

03:59.229 --> 04:01.736
... Master Yoda's warship
has fled the system.

04:01.996 --> 04:05.740
What further evidence do you require
of the Jedi's weakness?

04:10.963 --> 04:13.331
This is King Katuunko.
Speak.

04:13.660 --> 04:15.667
<i>Master Yoda would like
to talk with you, sir.</i>

04:18.630 --> 04:21.247
<i>A pleasure it is,
to hear your voice, your heighness.</i>

04:21.416 --> 04:23.883
<i>Master Yoda,
of the Jedi Council this is.</i>

04:24.295 --> 04:25.345
Master Jedi...

04:25.515 --> 04:28.879
... I though perhaps Count Dooku
had frightened you off.

04:29.358 --> 04:32.928
<i>Delayed have I been,
but not too far away am I now.</i>

04:33.418 --> 04:37.187
<i>Unaware I was, Count Dooku
was invited to our meeting.</i>

04:37.545 --> 04:39.934
The Count invited himself.

04:40.104 --> 04:42.263
He assures me
that in this time of war...

04:42.433 --> 04:45.780
... his droids can offer my world
greater security than your Jedi.

04:46.858 --> 04:48.767
<i>A matter of debate that is.</i>

04:49.359 --> 04:52.739
Your Majesty might prefer more than words.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.330
What do you have in mind?

04:54.657 --> 04:58.501
If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior
you believe he is...

04:59.117 --> 05:00.544
... let him prove it.

05:00.951 --> 05:04.000
Allow me to send my best troops
to capture him.

05:04.261 --> 05:07.170
If he escapes, join the Republic.

05:07.671 --> 05:09.997
But should my droids defeat Yoda...

05:10.356 --> 05:13.141
... consider an alliance
with the Seperatists.

05:13.476 --> 05:16.852
I did not request Yoda's presence here
to test him in battle.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.687
<i>Accept the challenge I do,
your heighness.</i>

05:19.857 --> 05:22.400
<i>Arrive by nightfall, I will.</i>

05:23.730 --> 05:26.863
Master Yoda must be given a fair fight.

05:27.298 --> 05:29.310
My dear King Katuunko...

05:29.480 --> 05:31.558
... I would have it
no other way.

05:40.605 --> 05:42.455
Beautiful this moon is.

05:43.228 --> 05:45.529
Amazing the universe is.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.436
There's gotta be a full
battalion in there.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.351
Probably packin' armor too.

05:59.704 --> 06:00.980
We'll have somethin' for 'em.

06:05.045 --> 06:07.068
I'm deploying my forces, master.

06:07.100 --> 06:12.658
<i>Yoda has made a grave mistake,
straying this far from Coruscant.</i>

06:12.983 --> 06:16.954
I will see the Jedi gets his
"fair" fight.

06:17.635 --> 06:19.188
Carry only what you need...

06:19.358 --> 06:21.671
... too much weight,
slow you down it will.

06:22.669 --> 06:25.119
Destroy Ventress,
your weapons will not.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.086
Come, come, Lieutenant.
Hurry we must.

06:28.601 --> 06:31.260
Sir, the rendezvous point is that way.

06:32.170 --> 06:33.715
As is our enemy.

06:34.322 --> 06:37.934
To reach our goal,
a straight path we will not follow.

06:38.670 --> 06:39.977
Let's move it, boys.

06:42.044 --> 06:43.439
Find Master Yoda.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.232
What does he look like?

06:46.733 --> 06:49.553
He'll be the small
shriveled green one...

06:49.723 --> 06:51.238
... with the light saber!

06:51.964 --> 06:55.001
Small, huh?
Don't worry, Supreme Leader...

06:55.171 --> 06:56.821
... we'll take care of him.

07:12.725 --> 07:13.998
I think I see them.

07:14.168 --> 07:17.298
They're hiding deep in the trees.
Fire on Sector 11.

07:26.874 --> 07:30.393
At ease be, my friends,
within range we are not.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.443
Hold it, hold it.

07:38.933 --> 07:40.821
I said hold it!

07:41.464 --> 07:42.655
That's far enough!

07:43.078 --> 07:44.078
I mean it! Stop!

07:44.806 --> 07:46.764
I said stop!

07:48.616 --> 07:52.247
- We're too big to fit in there.
- No we're not, watch this.

07:57.374 --> 08:00.006
- You were right.
- Next time listen to orders.

08:02.352 --> 08:03.885
Those tanks are too big to follow.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.821
See, see?

08:06.122 --> 08:07.680
Size is not everything.

08:08.630 --> 08:12.603
Smaller in number are we,
but larger in mind.

08:13.431 --> 08:16.513
Do you have any idea what the
General was talkin' about?

08:16.683 --> 08:20.402
How should I know?
There's no figurin' a Jedi Master.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.679
Infantry, advance.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.991
Go get 'em, boys.

08:31.673 --> 08:33.457
Sir, there are two patrols
coming in on foot.

08:33.865 --> 08:37.544
Now is the time to face the enemy,
Lieutenant. Ambush them we will.

08:40.874 --> 08:43.174
- We'll flank them from the South.
- Right, let's move.

08:56.688 --> 08:57.772
What was that?

08:58.579 --> 08:59.999
Blast him!

09:03.114 --> 09:05.422
Look, little green life form.

09:05.809 --> 09:07.959
You bucket head, that's the Jedi!

09:08.967 --> 09:11.501
He is a little one.
Blast him!

09:15.622 --> 09:17.829
Split up by squad and spread out.

09:17.999 --> 09:19.753
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

09:25.978 --> 09:28.804
Ok, clankers, suck laser!

09:38.421 --> 09:41.066
- Where's the General?
- I don't know, we got separated.

09:42.284 --> 09:43.454
Clankers!

09:45.448 --> 09:47.488
Fall back, there's too many of them.

09:58.499 --> 10:00.127
He's around here somewhere.

10:02.795 --> 10:03.755
Hey, get off of me!

10:04.936 --> 10:06.097
Don't move.

10:16.621 --> 10:19.021
<i>The Jedi destroyed
our advance troops.</i>

10:20.243 --> 10:23.691
Master Yoda is living up to
my expectations.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.125
Commander...

10:25.436 --> 10:27.778
... have you pinpointed
the Jedi's location?

10:28.312 --> 10:30.740
<i>Affirmative. The clones gave
away their position.</i>

10:31.107 --> 10:34.012
<i>Our heavy troops are moving to
engage them now.</i>

10:39.744 --> 10:42.126
I hope the General reaches the
rendezvous point.

10:42.420 --> 10:44.409
This should buy him time.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.810
- Lieutenant, can you walk?
- I think I'm okay.

11:00.857 --> 11:02.939
Die, Republic dog!

11:16.483 --> 11:18.310
What are we gonna do, sir?

11:25.787 --> 11:27.922
- What's the General doing?
- Keep blasting!

11:34.025 --> 11:35.677
Hey, what's going on?

11:41.506 --> 11:42.812
Get out of the way, all of you!

11:43.257 --> 11:44.980
I'm having a serious malfunction!

11:46.694 --> 11:47.851
Don't shoot!

11:49.265 --> 11:50.920
I'm on your side!

11:56.116 --> 11:58.845
- You found us just in time sir.
- Left behind...

11:59.015 --> 12:00.246
... no one will be.

12:04.231 --> 12:05.684
Rollers, inbound.

12:12.061 --> 12:12.952
Retreat!

12:13.061 --> 12:14.637
Cover you, I will.

12:23.070 --> 12:27.067
<i>Republic troops are injured,
the Jedi is in full retreat, Supreme Leader.</i>

12:27.614 --> 12:30.250
Good.
Pursue them without delay.

12:31.093 --> 12:33.433
The contest is not over yet.

12:35.244 --> 12:36.240
Master Yoda...

12:36.647 --> 12:39.201
... I hear you're having trouble
with the droid army?

12:39.817 --> 12:42.160
<i>Trouble?
I know nothing of this trouble.</i>

12:42.330 --> 12:44.708
<i>Look forward to our meeting
soon I do.</i>

12:46.787 --> 12:49.713
The Jedi won't allude me for long.

13:00.345 --> 13:03.475
Are you sure we should go in there, General?
There's no way out.

13:04.147 --> 13:05.977
Now rest, we must.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.412
We're low on ammo, sir.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.333
Only two grenades,
and one rocket for the launcher.

13:36.742 --> 13:38.298
Against a battalion?

13:38.788 --> 13:39.961
Forget it, we've lost.

13:40.514 --> 13:42.490
So certain of defeat, are you?

13:46.142 --> 13:48.485
With respect, General,
maybe you should go on.

13:48.655 --> 13:49.805
Let us slow 'em down.

13:52.267 --> 13:55.418
All around us, is that with
which we need to prevail is.

13:59.974 --> 14:01.315
Come, sit.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.110
Your helmets, remove them.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.444
Your faces I wish to see.

14:07.908 --> 14:11.243
There's not much to look at here, sir.
We all share the same face.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.532
Deceive you, eyes can.

14:13.702 --> 14:17.499
In the Force, very different
each one of you are.

14:18.516 --> 14:21.381
Rys, always focused on the enemy,
are you.

14:22.975 --> 14:25.314
For inspiration,
look to yourself...

14:25.653 --> 14:27.330
... and those beside you.

14:29.518 --> 14:32.015
Jek, concerned about weapons you are.

14:32.703 --> 14:34.972
Weapons do not win battles.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.988
Your mind, powerful it is.

14:38.389 --> 14:41.219
Outthink the droids, you can.

14:42.494 --> 14:45.017
Thire, rush not into fights.

14:45.187 --> 14:46.528
Long is the war.

14:47.055 --> 14:49.657
Only by surviving it,
will you prevail.

14:50.766 --> 14:51.766
Yes.

14:53.946 --> 14:56.022
Clones you may be...

14:56.266 --> 14:58.748
... but the Force
resides in all life forms.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.252
Use it you can,
to quiet your mind.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.390
Tanks.

15:14.584 --> 15:19.016
- Is that the best they can throw at us?
- Yeah, but I've only got one shot left.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.854
- Greet them I will.
- General...

15:21.148 --> 15:23.940
... you don't plan to take
that whole column by yourself?

15:26.101 --> 15:28.695
Have you three I do.
Outnumbered are they.

15:31.021 --> 15:33.712
Know the time to help me, you will.

15:47.045 --> 15:49.479
It's the Jedi!
Block his escape!

15:50.701 --> 15:52.010
Prepare to fire!

16:00.713 --> 16:02.970
<i>Supreme Leader,
we found the Jedi.</i>

16:03.446 --> 16:05.138
Excellent.
Where is he?

16:05.586 --> 16:08.001
<i>He's just sitting here,
in front of our tanks.</i>

16:08.403 --> 16:10.060
Shoot him,
shoot him now!

16:11.778 --> 16:14.162
Quickly!
Ready, Aim, Fire!

16:15.453 --> 16:16.233
Fire!

16:25.378 --> 16:26.702
He's gone under the tank!

16:36.747 --> 16:38.899
Run for it!

16:40.934 --> 16:44.630
But I just got promoted.

16:49.781 --> 16:52.815
Doesn't look like the General
needs help to me.

16:59.589 --> 17:00.944
We've got him in our sights.

17:14.457 --> 17:16.376
That's a lot of smoke
for a surrender.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.992
Report.
What's going on over there?

17:21.406 --> 17:22.590
224, come in.

17:24.238 --> 17:25.886
Where is 224?

17:26.231 --> 17:27.672
<i>Destroyed, Supreme Leader.</i>

17:27.842 --> 17:30.459
<i>The Jedi has overrun our position
and....</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:35.729
I think perhaps all those stories
about the Jedi are true.

17:37.276 --> 17:40.030
The fight isn't over yet, Majesty.

17:51.797 --> 17:54.112
The General's cutting 'em up.

17:54.962 --> 17:56.115
We've got trouble.

17:56.383 --> 17:58.879
Clankers sent reinforcements.

18:00.092 --> 18:03.360
General's too busy with that tank,
he won't see 'em coming.

18:03.530 --> 18:05.849
I think I know
how to deal with them.

18:30.784 --> 18:33.169
Yeah!
Great shot, sir!

18:33.539 --> 18:34.788
That's givin' it to the clankers.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.965
Learned something today,
have you, Lieutenant?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.718
I think we all did, General.

18:53.281 --> 18:56.726
Come, behind schedule are we.
Not polite to be late.

19:06.632 --> 19:08.112
You were right, Count Dooku.

19:08.537 --> 19:11.461
One Jedi is not worth
a hundred battle droids.

19:12.378 --> 19:14.184
More like a thousand.

19:14.972 --> 19:17.705
I'm sorry,
but I will be joining the Republic.

19:18.159 --> 19:21.307
<i>I urge you to reconsider,
wise king.</i>

19:21.615 --> 19:23.461
<i>I promise,
you won't regret it.</i>

19:23.756 --> 19:27.064
Your agent also promised me
Yoda would get a fair fight.

19:27.561 --> 19:30.093
I will not deal with those,
who break their words.

19:31.286 --> 19:32.677
<i>So be it.</i>

19:32.847 --> 19:37.040
<i>Perhaps our negotiations
will be more fruitful with your successor!</i>

19:37.284 --> 19:38.893
<i>Ventress, kill him!</i>

19:56.734 --> 19:58.161
Jedi Master Yoda.

19:58.622 --> 20:01.780
I am very pleased to meet you,
at last.

20:02.499 --> 20:05.211
Share the feeling, I do,
King Katuunko.

20:08.727 --> 20:10.258
Failed you, Ventress has...

20:10.519 --> 20:11.342
... Count.

20:12.161 --> 20:14.429
I don't fear you, Jedi.

20:14.994 --> 20:17.752
Strong you are with the dark side,
young one...

20:17.922 --> 20:19.434
... but not that strong.

20:22.738 --> 20:24.961
Still much to learn you have.

20:27.954 --> 20:29.569
Surrender, you should.

20:51.033 --> 20:51.991
In the end...

20:52.161 --> 20:54.552
... cowards are those
who follow the dark side.

20:55.409 --> 20:58.639
<i>It's a pity I wasn't there in person,
my old master.</i>

20:59.096 --> 21:00.500
A pity, indeed...

21:00.981 --> 21:02.268
... my fallen apprentice.

21:04.211 --> 21:07.440
Perhaps now,
begin negotiations we can.

21:07.911 --> 21:10.308
That is not necessary,
my friend.

21:10.776 --> 21:12.028
You have my faith.

21:12.413 --> 21:15.793
Toydaria would be honored
to host a Republic base.

21:16.039 --> 21:17.025
My people...

21:17.304 --> 21:18.841
... are at your service.

21:20.098 --> 21:21.265
Your Majesty...

21:21.619 --> 21:23.304
... fail you, we will not.
