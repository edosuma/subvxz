00:33.030 --> 00:34.020
>> John: HELLO THERE,

00:34.039 --> 00:36.070
AND WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

00:36.090 --> 00:37.189
AND LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:37.210 --> 00:38.159
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:38.179 --> 00:39.189
TONIGHT.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.250
OUR WHOLE SHOW IS ACTUALLY GOING

00:40.270 --> 00:42.000
TO BE ABOUT ONE THING,

00:42.020 --> 00:43.119
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT,

00:43.140 --> 00:44.170
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHY.

00:44.189 --> 00:45.270
BECAUSE ALL WEEK LONG,

00:45.289 --> 00:46.240
PROTESTERS HAVE CONTINUED

00:46.259 --> 00:48.079
TO FILL THE STREETS IN ALL

00:48.100 --> 00:49.159
50 STATES IN THE WAKE OF

00:49.179 --> 00:50.259
THE HORRIFIC MURDER OF

00:50.280 --> 00:52.049
GEORGE FLOYD BY THE POLICE.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.030
AND IN RESPONSE TO THOSE

00:54.049 --> 00:54.240
PROTESTS -- WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:54.259 --> 00:55.289
A STIRRING PUSH BACK AGAINST

00:56.009 --> 00:57.119
INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND

00:57.140 --> 00:59.219
BRUTALITY -- IT'S BEEN FRANKLY

00:59.240 --> 01:00.179
SICKENING TO SEE THEM MET WITH

01:00.200 --> 01:01.270
THIS.

01:01.289 --> 01:03.250
>> ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PEACEFUL

01:03.270 --> 01:05.129
PROTESTS HAVE TOO OFTEN DEVOLVED

01:05.150 --> 01:06.219
INTO STANDOFFS WITH HEAVILY

01:06.239 --> 01:08.000
ARMED POLICE USING

01:08.019 --> 01:10.030
MILITARY-STYLE TACTICS.

01:10.049 --> 01:11.200
FLASH BANGS, TEAR GAS,

01:11.219 --> 01:13.019
RUBBER BULLETS, HELICOPTERS,

01:13.039 --> 01:14.230
ARMORED VEHICLES.

01:14.250 --> 01:15.269
>> WE'RE OUT HERE PEACEFULLY

01:15.289 --> 01:17.060
PROTESTING.

01:17.079 --> 01:17.239
BUT THEY'RE ARMED LIKE THEY'RE

01:17.260 --> 01:19.129
GOING TO WAR.

01:19.150 --> 01:21.039
>> John: YEAH, THEY ARE.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.099
AND LOOK, IF POLICE ARE TRYING

01:22.120 --> 01:23.150
TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC THEY'RE

01:23.170 --> 01:25.079
NOT GUILTY OF DISPLAYING

01:25.099 --> 01:26.170
EXCESSIVE FORCE, IT'S PROBABLY

01:26.189 --> 01:28.069
NOT A GOOD IDEA TO REPEATEDLY

01:28.090 --> 01:31.210
DISPLAY EXCESSIVE FORCE ON

01:31.230 --> 01:32.289
NATIONAL TELEVISION, INCLUDING

01:33.009 --> 01:34.030
IN THIS CITY, WHERE

01:34.049 --> 01:35.060
MAYOR DE BLASIO PRAISED THEM FOR

01:35.079 --> 01:36.099
THEIR "TREMENDOUS RESTRAINT,"

01:36.120 --> 01:37.270
AND GOVERNOR CUOMO THREATENED TO

01:37.289 --> 01:39.049
SEND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD.

01:39.069 --> 01:40.170
AND I WILL SAY: HAVING RECENTLY

01:40.189 --> 01:41.289
SAID THAT I COULDN'T WAIT TO GO

01:42.009 --> 01:43.170
BACK TO HATING ANDREW CUOMO

01:43.189 --> 01:44.170
AGAIN, I DIDN'T THINK THE

01:44.189 --> 01:45.159
OPPORTUNITY WOULD COME QUITE

01:45.180 --> 01:49.009
THIS SOON.

01:49.030 --> 01:50.069
AND THESE PROTESTS HAVE RECEIVED

01:50.090 --> 01:51.079
A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT, WITH

01:51.099 --> 01:52.090
MASSIVE MARCHES TAKING PLACE

01:52.109 --> 01:57.090
AROUND THE WORLD.

01:57.109 --> 01:58.090
AND THE PROTESTORS' MESSAGE HAS

01:58.109 --> 01:59.210
TAKEN MANY FORMS, FROM CHANTS,

01:59.229 --> 02:01.280
TO SIGNS, TO A MAN WHO CALLED IN

02:02.000 --> 02:02.150
TO AN L.A. POLICE COMMISSION

02:02.170 --> 02:03.019
MEETING, HELD OVER ZOOM.

02:03.040 --> 02:03.290
HE HAD BEEN GIVEN 30 SECONDS,

02:04.010 --> 02:06.099
WHICH HE USED WITH MAXIMUM

02:06.120 --> 02:07.099
EFFICIENCY TO DELIVER A MESSAGE

02:07.120 --> 02:08.270
FOR POLICE CHIEF MICHEL MOORE:

02:08.289 --> 02:10.069
>> I FIND IT DISGUSTING THAT

02:10.090 --> 02:11.039
THE LAPD IS SLAUGHTERING

02:11.060 --> 02:11.229
PEACEFUL PROTESTERS

02:11.250 --> 02:13.009
ON THE STREET.

02:13.030 --> 02:14.060
I HAD TWO FRIENDS GO TO THE

02:14.080 --> 02:15.250
PROTESTS IN BEVERLY HILLS

02:15.270 --> 02:16.289
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, AND THE

02:17.009 --> 02:18.079
PROTEST WAS PEACEFUL UNTIL THE

02:18.099 --> 02:21.129
POLICE SHOWED UP WITH THEIR

02:21.150 --> 02:22.060
EXCESSIVE, VIOLENT FORCE,

02:22.079 --> 02:22.250
SHOOTING RUBBER BULLETS AND

02:22.270 --> 02:23.150
THROWING TEAR GAS.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.069
IS THIS WHAT YOU THINK IS

02:24.090 --> 02:25.090
PROTECTING AND SERVING?

02:25.110 --> 02:26.099
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BULLSHIT.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.079
FUCK YOU, MICHEL MOORE!

02:27.099 --> 02:28.079
I REFUSE TO CALL YOU AN OFFICER

02:28.099 --> 02:30.120
OR A CHIEF BECAUSE YOU DON'T

02:30.139 --> 02:30.259
DESERVE THOSE TITLES.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.039
YOU ARE A DISGRACE.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.050
SUCK MY DICK AND CHOKE ON IT.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.000
I YIELD MY TIME.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.170
FUCK YOU!

02:36.189 --> 02:39.110
>> John: IF THE PRESIDENT IS

02:39.129 --> 02:40.000
TAKING NOTES, THAT IS WHAT

02:40.020 --> 02:41.050
A PERFECT CALL LOOKS LIKE.

02:41.069 --> 02:43.050
MY FAVORITE PART IS THAT, AFTER

02:43.069 --> 02:44.079
HE'S FINISHED UNLOADING ON THAT

02:44.099 --> 02:45.199
POLICE CHIEF, HE YIELDS HIS

02:45.219 --> 02:46.250
TIME, REALIZES HE STILL HAS

02:46.270 --> 02:48.090
A COUPLE OF SECONDS LEFT,

02:48.110 --> 02:49.219
SO UN-YIELDS IT, AND THROWS

02:49.240 --> 02:52.060
IN A BONUS "FUCK YOU."

02:52.079 --> 02:52.289
NOW AS FOR THE PRESIDENT

02:53.009 --> 02:53.159
HIMSELF,

02:53.180 --> 02:54.270
HE INITIALLY HID FROM THE

02:54.289 --> 02:56.030
PROTESTERS IN A BUNKER, LATER

02:56.050 --> 02:57.090
CLAIMING HE WASN'T HIDING, HE

02:57.110 --> 02:58.180
WAS ACTUALLY JUST "INSPECTING

02:58.199 --> 02:59.229
IT," THEN HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL

02:59.250 --> 03:01.169
HAD POLICE GAS PROTESTORS

03:01.189 --> 03:03.090
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE SO TRUMP

03:03.110 --> 03:04.229
COULD HAVE AN INEXPLICABLE PHOTO

03:04.250 --> 03:06.090
OP AT A NEARBY CHURCH, WHILE

03:06.110 --> 03:07.159
HOLDING UP A BIBLE LIKE IT'S

03:07.180 --> 03:08.120
THE TICKET FOR HIS SANDWICH

03:08.139 --> 03:10.009
ORDER THAT WAS JUST CALLED.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.110
HE ALSO, IN ANNOUNCING JOB

03:11.129 --> 03:13.039
NUMBERS ON FRIDAY, INVOKED

03:13.060 --> 03:14.240
GEORGE FLOYD'S NAME, SAYING,

03:14.259 --> 03:16.090
"THIS WAS A GREAT DAY FOR HIM,"

03:16.110 --> 03:19.250
WHICH IS UTTERLY FUCKING

03:19.270 --> 03:21.069
DISGUSTING.

03:21.090 --> 03:21.259
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO

03:21.280 --> 03:22.189
FOCUS ON TRUMP TONIGHT.

03:22.210 --> 03:24.039
NOR ARE WE -- UNLIKE SOME IN

03:24.060 --> 03:25.210
CABLE NEWS -- GOING TO DWELL ON

03:25.229 --> 03:27.039
THE INCIDENTS OF LOOTING THAT

03:27.060 --> 03:28.189
OCCURRED, EXCEPT TO SAY: IF

03:28.210 --> 03:30.060
YOU'VE SAID THE NAME "MACY'S"

03:30.079 --> 03:31.000
MORE THAN YOU'VE SAID THE NAME

03:31.020 --> 03:32.150
"BREONNA TAYLOR" THIS WEEK, YOU

03:32.170 --> 03:34.150
CAN VERY MUCH FUCK OFF.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.219
LIKEWISE, IF YOU'RE ASKING WHY

03:35.240 --> 03:36.210
A SPONTANEOUS, DECENTRALIZED

03:36.229 --> 03:37.210
PROTEST CAN'T CONTROL EVERY ONE

03:37.229 --> 03:39.039
OF ITS PARTICIPANTS MORE THAN

03:39.060 --> 03:40.229
YOU'RE ASKING THE SAME ABOUT

03:40.250 --> 03:42.270
A TAXPAYER-FUNDED,

03:42.289 --> 03:43.219
HEAVILY-REGIMENTED,

03:43.240 --> 03:45.150
PAID WORKFORCE, YOU CAN ALSO,

03:45.170 --> 03:46.060
IN THE WORDS OF THIS

03:46.079 --> 03:47.199
GENERATION'S ROBERT FROST:

03:47.219 --> 03:50.120
SUCK MY DICK AND CHOKE ON IT,

03:50.139 --> 03:51.000
FUCK YOU.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.030
INSTEAD, TONIGHT, LET'S TALK

03:52.050 --> 03:53.229
ABOUT THE POLICE.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.120
BECAUSE ALL WEEK, WE'VE SEEN

03:55.139 --> 03:56.270
GRAPHIC VIDEOS -- WHICH ARE

03:56.289 --> 03:58.060
GOING TO BE HARD TO WATCH --

03:58.079 --> 03:59.229
OF THEM DRIVING DIRECTLY INTO

03:59.250 --> 04:01.099
CROWDS, BEATING PEOPLE WITH

04:01.120 --> 04:02.139
STICKS, AND SOMETIMES ASSAULTING

04:02.159 --> 04:03.180
THE RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE, WITH

04:03.199 --> 04:05.020
SHOCKING SPEED AND BARBARITY.

04:05.039 --> 04:08.159
>> PREMATURELY SHOOTING PEOPLE?

04:08.180 --> 04:09.240
PREMATURELY USING EXCESSIVE

04:09.259 --> 04:11.199
FORCE?

04:11.219 --> 04:12.219
GET YOUR SCARY ASS HOME

04:12.240 --> 04:17.009
SOMEWHERE.

04:17.029 --> 04:21.230
>> WHOA.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.139
>> OH, NO.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.199
>> [SCREAMING]

04:24.220 --> 04:26.160
>> WHAT THE FUCK?

04:26.180 --> 04:29.230
WHAT THE FUCK?

04:29.250 --> 04:32.079
WHAT THE FUCK?

04:32.100 --> 04:33.290
>> John: IT'S GENUINELY

04:34.009 --> 04:34.290
IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE HOW

04:35.009 --> 04:36.199
ENRAGING THAT IS.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.060
THEY'RE PROTESTING EXCESSIVE

04:38.079 --> 04:39.079
FORCE BY POLICE AND THE POLICE

04:39.100 --> 04:40.129
JUST START PEPPER SPRAYING THEM

04:40.149 --> 04:42.180
LIKE IT'S FUCKING SUNSCREEN.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.209
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF HUNDREDS

04:43.230 --> 04:45.079
AND HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.159
AND WE'RE TAPING THIS SATURDAY

04:46.180 --> 04:47.290
MORNING -- WHO KNOWS WHAT'LL

04:48.009 --> 04:49.009
HAVE HAPPENED BY SUNDAY NIGHT?

04:49.029 --> 04:50.139
MAYBE THEY'LL BE USING GRENADES,

04:50.159 --> 04:51.269
EVEN AS "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

04:51.290 --> 04:53.290
WEIGHS IN WITH AN OP-ED TITLED,

04:54.009 --> 04:54.269
"WHY WE NEED TO BRING HITLER

04:54.290 --> 04:55.279
BACK TO LIFE AS A ROBOT RIGHT

04:56.000 --> 04:56.269
NOW."

04:56.290 --> 04:58.120
THEY JUST THINK IT'S VALUABLE

04:58.139 --> 04:59.220
YOU READ THAT POINT OF VIEW.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.079
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T, BUT THEY

05:01.100 --> 05:03.009
THINK THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD.

05:03.029 --> 05:04.129
AND LOOK, FOR ANY VIEWERS

05:04.149 --> 05:06.060
SITTING AT HOME, SHOCKED BY

05:06.079 --> 05:07.040
THE SCENES OF POLICE BRUTALITY,

05:07.060 --> 05:08.040
I GET IT.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.139
I'M WHITE, TOO.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.089
BUT IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING,

05:10.110 --> 05:11.089
THAT'S THE TIP OF A VERY LARGE

05:11.110 --> 05:13.120
ICEBERG.

05:13.139 --> 05:15.000
IT DIDN'T START THIS WEEK, OR

05:15.019 --> 05:16.139
WITH THIS PRESIDENT, AND IT

05:16.160 --> 05:18.120
ALWAYS DISPROPORTIONATELY FALLS

05:18.139 --> 05:19.089
ON BLACK COMMUNITIES.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.230
BECAUSE HERE ARE SOME HARD

05:21.250 --> 05:23.029
FACTS: IN MINNEAPOLIS, WHERE

05:23.050 --> 05:24.269
GEORGE FLOYD WAS MURDERED,

05:24.290 --> 05:26.040
POLICE USE FORCE AGAINST

05:26.060 --> 05:27.129
BLACK PEOPLE AT 7 TIMES THE RATE

05:27.149 --> 05:28.220
OF WHITES.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.040
BLACK AMERICANS ARE 2.5 TIMES

05:30.060 --> 05:31.209
MORE LIKELY THAN WHITES TO BE

05:31.230 --> 05:34.259
KILLED BY POLICE.

05:34.279 --> 05:38.120
AND ABOUT ONE AND EVERY THOUSAND

05:38.139 --> 05:39.040
BLACK MEN CAN EXPECT TO BE

05:39.060 --> 05:41.120
KILLED BY POLICE.

05:41.139 --> 05:42.170
IF YOU ARE BLACK IN AMERICA,

05:42.189 --> 05:43.139
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE

05:43.159 --> 05:44.120
HOW SCARED, ANGRY, AND EXHAUSTED

05:44.139 --> 05:44.279
YOU MUST FEEL.

05:45.000 --> 05:45.180
NOT ONLY THIS WEEK,

05:45.199 --> 05:47.060
BUT CONSTANTLY.

05:47.079 --> 05:48.279
MEDICAL GROUPS SAY POLICE

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
VIOLENCE AGAINST BLACK AND BROWN

05:50.019 --> 05:51.040
AMERICANS IS JUST ONE OF MANY

05:51.060 --> 05:52.110
PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL

05:52.129 --> 05:53.170
FACTORS THAT MAKE RACISM

05:53.189 --> 05:55.139
A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.

05:55.159 --> 05:57.050
AND LOOK: CLEARLY, THE POLICE

05:57.069 --> 05:58.199
ARE JUST ONE PART OF A MUCH

05:58.220 --> 05:59.240
LARGER SYSTEM OF RACIAL

05:59.259 --> 06:01.189
INEQUALITY.

06:01.209 --> 06:03.139
BUT FOR TONIGHT, WE ARE GOING

06:03.160 --> 06:05.029
TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THEM,

06:05.050 --> 06:06.110
AND TRY TO ADDRESS THREE BASIC

06:06.129 --> 06:08.000
QUESTIONS: HOW THE FUCK WE GOT

06:08.019 --> 06:10.129
TO THIS POINT, WHAT THE

06:10.149 --> 06:12.019
OBSTACLES TO REFORM HAVE BEEN,

06:12.040 --> 06:12.290
AND WHAT WE CAN DO GOING

06:13.009 --> 06:14.149
FORWARD.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.050
AND LET'S START BY ACKNOWLEDGING

06:16.069 --> 06:17.110
THE POLICE HAVE LONG ENJOYED

06:17.129 --> 06:18.100
AN EXALTED ROLE IN AMERICAN

06:18.120 --> 06:19.230
SOCIETY.

06:19.250 --> 06:23.029
IN POP CULTURE, THEY'RE THE

06:23.050 --> 06:24.269
HEROES OF BELOVED MOVIES AND

06:24.290 --> 06:25.259
TV SHOWS LIKE, "CRANKY GUN

06:25.279 --> 06:26.189
GRANDPA," AND "COCAINE COPS WHO

06:26.209 --> 06:27.279
FUCK," AND "MANIC BIGOT AND HIS

06:28.000 --> 06:29.139
ONE BLACK FRIEND."

06:29.160 --> 06:31.089
AMERICA LOVES NOTHING MORE THAN

06:31.110 --> 06:32.139
A RENEGADE COP WHO DOESN'T PLAY

06:32.159 --> 06:36.180
BY THE RULES.

06:36.199 --> 06:37.240
BUT, OF COURSE, THE REALITY OF

06:37.259 --> 06:38.180
POLICING IS -- AND HAS ALWAYS

06:38.199 --> 06:39.199
BEEN -- VERY DIFFERENT.

06:39.220 --> 06:41.009
AND IT MIGHT BE WORTH GOING

06:41.029 --> 06:42.209
THROUGH SOME OF THE HISTORY

06:42.230 --> 06:43.269
HERE, BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

06:43.290 --> 06:44.269
UNDERSTAND HOW DEEPLY POLICING

06:44.290 --> 06:46.139
IN THIS COUNTRY IS ENTANGLED

06:46.159 --> 06:48.009
WITH WHITE SUPREMACY.

06:48.029 --> 06:52.279
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE

06:53.000 --> 06:53.230
THINKING: WELL, JOIN THE CLUB,

06:53.250 --> 06:54.100
POLICING.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.069
THIS IS AMERICA.

06:55.090 --> 06:56.060
THE ONLY INSTITUTION NOT DEEPLY

06:56.079 --> 06:57.290
ENTANGLED WITH THE HISTORY OF

06:58.009 --> 06:58.180
WHITE SUPREMACY IS OLIVE GARDEN.

06:58.199 --> 06:59.100
AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE IT'S

06:59.120 --> 07:00.050
ALWAYS BEEN A POWERFUL SYMBOL OF

07:00.069 --> 07:01.050
WHITE INFERIORITY.

07:01.069 --> 07:02.110
BUT THE POLICE HAVE NOT JUST

07:02.129 --> 07:03.040
BEEN INCIDENTALLY TAINTED BY

07:03.060 --> 07:04.290
RACISM.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.269
FOR MUCH OF U.S. HISTORY,

07:06.290 --> 07:07.269
"LAW ENFORCEMENT" MEANT

07:07.290 --> 07:09.050
ENFORCING LAWS THAT WERE

07:09.069 --> 07:10.029
EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO SUBJUGATE

07:10.050 --> 07:12.000
BLACK PEOPLE.

07:12.019 --> 07:14.110
SOME OF AMERICA'S FIRST

07:14.129 --> 07:15.069
LAW ENFORCEMENT UNITS WERE

07:15.089 --> 07:16.120
THE SLAVE PATROLS TASKED WITH

07:16.139 --> 07:17.089
CAPTURING AND RETURNING PEOPLE

07:17.110 --> 07:18.149
WHO'D ESCAPED FROM SLAVERY.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.110
AND WHEN SLAVERY ENDED,

07:20.129 --> 07:22.060
WHITE PEOPLE HAD NO INTENTION OF

07:22.079 --> 07:23.149
LETTING THAT BE THE END

07:23.170 --> 07:24.269
OF WHITE POWER.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.120
AS ONE ALABAMA PLANTER SAID IN

07:26.139 --> 07:28.069
THE WAKE OF EMANCIPATION:

07:28.089 --> 07:30.110
"WE HAVE THE POWER TO PASS

07:30.129 --> 07:32.090
STRINGENT POLICE LAWS TO GOVERN

07:32.110 --> 07:33.180
THE NEGROES -- THIS IS A

07:33.199 --> 07:34.259
BLESSING -- FOR THEY MUST BE

07:34.279 --> 07:35.290
CONTROLLED IN SOME WAY OR WHITE

07:36.009 --> 07:37.050
PEOPLE CANNOT LIVE AMONG THEM."

07:37.069 --> 07:38.000
AND I KNOW THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE

07:38.019 --> 07:39.029
TO HEAR.

07:39.050 --> 07:40.129
IT'S CERTAINLY UNCOMFORTABLE

07:40.149 --> 07:42.060
FOR ME TO SAY.

07:42.079 --> 07:43.259
BUT IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW

07:43.279 --> 07:45.120
WE GOT HERE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO

07:45.139 --> 07:46.290
REMEMBER THAT WE GOT HERE ON

07:47.009 --> 07:48.240
PURPOSE.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.100
NOW, FOR A CENTURY AFTER THAT,

07:50.120 --> 07:51.090
POLICE IN THE SOUTH WERE

07:51.110 --> 07:52.230
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING

07:52.250 --> 07:53.269
SEGREGATION, WHILE ALLOWING --

07:53.290 --> 07:55.129
AND SOMETIMES PARTICIPATING IN

07:55.149 --> 07:56.129
-- LYNCHINGS AND ANTI-BLACK

07:56.149 --> 07:57.180
TERRORISM.

07:57.199 --> 07:58.290
AND AS BLACK PEOPLE MIGRATED

07:59.009 --> 08:00.110
TO THE NORTH BY THE MILLIONS,

08:00.129 --> 08:01.259
THEY WERE MET THERE, YET AGAIN,

08:01.279 --> 08:03.040
BY BRUTALITY.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.250
AND ALL OF THIS -- COUPLED WITH

08:04.269 --> 08:06.079
THE CONTINUED DENIAL OF ECONOMIC

08:06.100 --> 08:07.220
AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES, NOT

08:07.240 --> 08:09.220
ALWAYS PARTICULARLY SUBTLE, BY

08:09.240 --> 08:11.209
THE WAY -- MEANT THAT, BY THE

08:11.230 --> 08:13.079
SUMMER OF 1967, THERE WERE A

08:13.100 --> 08:14.149
SERIES OF HIGH-PROFILE UPRISINGS

08:14.170 --> 08:16.199
AGAINST RACIAL INJUSTICE ACROSS

08:16.220 --> 08:20.189
THE UNITED STATES -- OR AS

08:20.209 --> 08:21.149
WHITE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DESCRIBE

08:21.170 --> 08:22.149
THAT EXACT TIME:

08:22.170 --> 08:24.129
>> THE SUMMER OF 1967.

08:24.149 --> 08:25.170
IT IS KNOWN AS THE

08:25.189 --> 08:27.029
"SUMMER OF LOVE."

08:27.050 --> 08:29.269
>> John: YEAH, IT IS.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.040
AND THAT'S A PRETTY BIG

08:31.060 --> 08:32.220
DISCONNECT.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.120
AND IT HONESTLY MAKES ME

08:34.139 --> 08:35.210
SLIGHTLY WORRY THAT WHAT'S

08:35.230 --> 08:37.210
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WILL BE

08:37.230 --> 08:39.049
REMEMBERED BY WHITE HISTORIANS

08:39.070 --> 08:40.059
AS "THE SUMMER OF CHROMATICA."

08:40.080 --> 08:41.179
AND LOOK, THINGS DID NOT IMPROVE

08:41.200 --> 08:42.259
FROM THE '60s ONWARD.

08:42.279 --> 08:44.029
NIXON PLEDGED FEALTY TO

08:44.049 --> 08:45.090
LAW AND ORDER AND STARTED THE

08:45.110 --> 08:46.279
WAR ON DRUGS, WHICH REAGAN LATER

08:47.000 --> 08:49.019
TURBO-CHARGED, AND, BY THE TIME

08:49.039 --> 08:49.210
WE GOT TO THE '90s, A SCHOOL OF

08:49.230 --> 08:51.070
THOUGHT CALLED "BROKEN WINDOWS"

08:51.090 --> 08:53.139
OR "ZERO TOLERANCE" POLICING HAD

08:53.159 --> 08:54.250
STARTED TO TAKE ROOT, WHICH HELD

08:54.269 --> 08:56.009
THAT, IF MINOR CRIMES ARE LEFT

08:56.029 --> 08:57.139
UNATTENDED, IT WILL LEAD TO MORE

08:57.159 --> 08:58.159
SERIOUS CRIMES.

08:58.179 --> 08:59.159
THEREFORE, POLICE HAD BETTER

08:59.179 --> 09:02.120
CRACK DOWN ON THOSE MINOR

09:02.139 --> 09:02.200
OFFENSES.

09:02.220 --> 09:04.080
THAT FUELED THE SATURATION OF

09:04.100 --> 09:06.190
POLICE IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES

09:06.210 --> 09:08.049
OF COLOR, AND GAVE WAY TO

09:08.070 --> 09:09.190
POLICIES LIKE STOP-AND-FRISK,

09:09.210 --> 09:10.179
WHICH ESSENTIALLY ALLOWED

09:10.200 --> 09:11.190
POLICE OFFICERS TO SEARCH PEOPLE

09:11.210 --> 09:12.190
AT RANDOM.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.259
AT THAT POLICY'S PEAK, IN 2011,

09:14.279 --> 09:17.059
OF THE NEARLY 700,000 STOPS

09:17.080 --> 09:19.100
RECORDED IN NEW YORK,

09:19.120 --> 09:20.289
THE VAST MAJORITY WERE OF BLACK

09:21.009 --> 09:24.129
AND LATINO PEOPLE.

09:24.149 --> 09:25.159
OR, TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY,

09:25.179 --> 09:26.090
THOSE POLICIES, TOO OFTEN,

09:26.110 --> 09:27.210
BASICALLY AMOUNTED TO THIS

09:27.230 --> 09:29.149
FUCKING BULLSHIT, JUST UNDER

09:29.169 --> 09:31.070
A DIFFERENT NAME.

09:31.090 --> 09:33.000
AND THAT SORT OF AGGRESSIVE

09:33.019 --> 09:34.129
POLICING WAS ACCOMPANIED BY

09:34.149 --> 09:35.279
CONSTANT CALLS TO INCREASE

09:36.000 --> 09:39.230
THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS

09:39.250 --> 09:40.039
ON THE STREETS.

09:40.059 --> 09:40.269
AND LET'S BE CLEAR: DEMOCRATS

09:40.289 --> 09:43.029
WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THAT,

09:43.049 --> 09:44.090
FROM BIG-CITY MAYORS ALL THE WAY

09:44.110 --> 09:46.000
ON UP TO THIS GUY:

09:46.019 --> 09:48.059
>> AN INITIATIVE TO PUT 100,000

09:48.080 --> 09:49.049
MORE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE

09:49.070 --> 09:49.269
STREET.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.289
>> MORE PRISONS, MORE

09:53.009 --> 09:54.110
PREVENTION, 100,000 MORE POLICE.

09:54.129 --> 09:56.159
>> 100,000 NEW POLICE IN

09:56.179 --> 09:59.059
COMMUNITIES OF ALL SIZES.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.259
>> WE NEED TO FINISH THE JOB OF

10:00.279 --> 10:02.139
PUTTING 100,000 MORE POLICE ON

10:02.159 --> 10:02.250
OUR STREETS.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.250
>> LAST FALL, CONGRESS SUPPORTED

10:04.269 --> 10:06.289
MY PLAN TO HIRE, IN ADDITION TO

10:07.009 --> 10:08.240
THE 100,000 COMMUNITY POLICE

10:08.259 --> 10:10.210
WE'VE ALREADY FUNDED, 50,000

10:10.230 --> 10:11.110
MORE, CONCENTRATED IN HIGH-CRIME

10:11.129 --> 10:12.149
NEIGHBORHOODS.

10:12.169 --> 10:13.200
>> John: YEAH, THANKS VERY MUCH,

10:13.220 --> 10:15.289
CONGRESS.

10:16.009 --> 10:16.210
100,000 POLICE OFFICERS ISN'T

10:16.230 --> 10:17.139
COOL.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.190
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL?

10:18.210 --> 10:19.190
MASSIVELY EXPANDING A BROKEN

10:19.210 --> 10:20.210
INSTITUTION TO SCORE CHEAP

10:20.230 --> 10:22.039
POLITICAL POINTS.

10:22.059 --> 10:23.070
AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT WHILE

10:23.090 --> 10:25.259
PLAYING THE SAXOPHONE, WELL,

10:25.279 --> 10:28.110
THAT JUST GETS EVEN COOLER.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.169
AND ALL THE WHILE, AS WE WERE

10:29.190 --> 10:30.240
CONTINUING TO BOOST FUNDING FOR

10:30.259 --> 10:31.269
POLICE AND GIVE THEM MORE

10:31.289 --> 10:32.289
AUTHORITY, WE WERE

10:33.009 --> 10:34.039
SIMULTANEOUSLY SLASHING SPENDING

10:34.059 --> 10:36.200
ON KEY SOCIAL SERVICES.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.009
THAT MEANT THAT, IN MANY

10:38.029 --> 10:39.059
COMMUNITIES, THE POLICE WERE

10:39.080 --> 10:40.169
THE ONLY ONES LEFT TO HANDLE

10:40.190 --> 10:42.049
ALMOST ANY ISSUE PEOPLE HAD.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.149
WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM, AS THIS

10:43.169 --> 10:45.110
FORMER DALLAS POLICE CHIEF

10:45.129 --> 10:46.250
READILY ADMITS.

10:46.269 --> 10:47.269
>> WE'RE ASKING COPS TO DO TOO

10:47.289 --> 10:50.100
MUCH IN THIS COUNTRY.

10:50.120 --> 10:50.169
WE ARE.

10:50.190 --> 10:51.039
WE'RE JUST ASKING US TO DO

10:51.059 --> 10:52.159
TOO MUCH.

10:52.179 --> 10:54.279
EVERY SOCIETAL FAILURE, WE PUT

10:55.000 --> 10:56.129
IT OFF ON THE COPS TO SOLVE.

10:56.149 --> 10:59.230
NOT ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH

10:59.250 --> 11:02.149
FUNDING, "LET THE COP HANDLE

11:02.169 --> 11:02.200
IT."

11:02.220 --> 11:03.129
NOT ENOUGH DRUG ADDICTION

11:03.149 --> 11:04.080
FUNDING, "LET'S GIVE IT TO THE

11:04.100 --> 11:05.279
COPS."

11:06.000 --> 11:06.259
HERE IN DALLAS, WE GOT A LOOSE

11:06.279 --> 11:08.009
DOG PROBLEM.

11:08.029 --> 11:09.129
"LET'S HAVE THE COPS CHASE LOOSE

11:09.149 --> 11:11.000
DOGS."

11:11.019 --> 11:12.080
>> John: AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:12.100 --> 11:14.000
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

11:14.019 --> 11:15.009
WE ARE ASKING POLICE TO DO FAR

11:15.029 --> 11:16.169
TOO MUCH.

11:16.190 --> 11:18.019
THEY HAVE A MASSIVE ARRAY OF

11:18.039 --> 11:19.090
COMPLICATED DUTIES THAT, IN MANY

11:19.110 --> 11:20.289
CASES, THEY JUST AREN'T EQUIPPED

11:21.009 --> 11:22.129
TO HANDLE -- MAKING THEM VERY

11:22.149 --> 11:23.139
MUCH THE JARED KUSHNERS OF LOCAL

11:23.159 --> 11:24.120
OFFICIALS.

11:24.139 --> 11:25.100
WITHOUT, OF COURSE,

11:25.120 --> 11:26.070
THE EXPRESSION, COMPLEXION,

11:26.090 --> 11:27.059
AND GENERAL DEMEANOR OF

11:27.080 --> 11:29.000
A HAUNTED BABY.

11:29.019 --> 11:30.269
SO WHILE WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

11:30.289 --> 11:32.259
ANGRY AT THE POLICE RIGHT NOW,

11:32.279 --> 11:34.110
LET'S ALSO BE ANGRY AT

11:34.129 --> 11:36.019
THE SERIES OF CHOICES THAT

11:36.039 --> 11:37.179
LEFT THEM AS ESSENTIALLY

11:37.200 --> 11:38.129
THE ONLY PUBLIC RESOURCE

11:38.149 --> 11:43.149
IN SOME COMMUNITIES.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.149
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, WE'VE

11:44.169 --> 11:45.269
MADE THOSE BAD CHOICES EVEN MORE

11:45.289 --> 11:46.149
DANGEROUS IN RECENT YEARS

11:46.169 --> 11:47.149
BY NEEDLESSLY ARMING POLICE

11:47.169 --> 11:48.269
TO THE FUCKING TEETH.

11:48.289 --> 11:50.230
AS WE DISCUSSED SIX YEARS AGO,

11:50.250 --> 11:52.220
WE'VE ISSUED THE POLICE LITERAL

11:52.240 --> 11:55.000
MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT, SOME

11:55.019 --> 11:55.179
OF WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN USED TO

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
CONTROL AND INTIMIDATE

11:56.220 --> 11:57.259
PROTESTORS THIS WEEK.

11:57.279 --> 11:58.269
AND IT'S FRANKLY NOT JUST THE

11:58.289 --> 12:00.129
HARDWARE THAT'S A PROBLEM HERE.

12:00.149 --> 12:03.049
BECAUSE A WHOLE SUB-INDUSTRY OF

12:03.070 --> 12:04.059
POLICE TRAINING HAS ALSO CROPPED

12:04.080 --> 12:05.190
UP TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE THAT

12:05.210 --> 12:07.029
COPS ARE AT WAR.

12:07.049 --> 12:09.120
AND PERHAPS NO ONE TAKES THAT

12:09.139 --> 12:11.169
IDEA FURTHER THAN THIS GUY.

12:11.190 --> 12:15.059
>> ONCE YOU'VE MADE THE DECISION

12:15.080 --> 12:16.149
TO TAKE A HUMAN LIFE, YOU'RE A

12:16.169 --> 12:17.269
TRANSFORMED CREATURE, YOU'RE A

12:17.289 --> 12:20.049
PREDATOR.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.029
WHAT DOES A PREDATOR DO?

12:22.049 --> 12:23.269
THEY KILL.

12:23.289 --> 12:29.159
ONLY A KILLER CAN HUNT A KILLER.

12:29.179 --> 12:31.279
ARE YOU EMOTIONALLY,

12:32.000 --> 12:33.250
SPIRITUALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY

12:33.269 --> 12:34.129
PREPARED TO SNUFF OUT A HUMAN

12:34.149 --> 12:35.240
LIFE IN DEFENSE OF INNOCENT

12:35.259 --> 12:38.259
LIVES?

12:38.279 --> 12:43.230
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION,

12:43.250 --> 12:46.080
YOU NEED TO FIND ANOTHER JOB.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.250
>> John: WOW.

12:48.269 --> 12:50.210
THE PROBLEM WITH TELLING SOMEONE

12:50.230 --> 12:51.230
THEY'RE A PREDATOR IS THAT IT

12:51.250 --> 12:53.019
PRIMES THEM TO SEE THE REST OF

12:53.039 --> 12:55.009
THE WORLD AS POTENTIAL PREY.

12:55.029 --> 12:56.139
OF COURSE COPS WHO WENT THROUGH

12:56.159 --> 12:57.120
THIS TRAINING COULD WIND UP ON

12:57.139 --> 12:58.169
EDGE.

12:58.190 --> 13:00.039
YOU WOULDN'T TRAIN A BARBER BY

13:00.059 --> 13:01.190
SAYING, "HERE ARE YOUR SCISSORS,

13:01.210 --> 13:02.190
SNIP LIKE THIS, AND OH, YEAH,

13:02.210 --> 13:03.110
THIS IS HOW TO PUNCTURE

13:03.129 --> 13:06.019
THE CAROTID ARTERY.

13:06.039 --> 13:07.230
NOW, YOU WON'T NEED TO USE THIS

13:07.250 --> 13:08.289
99% OF THE TIME, BUT IF YOU

13:09.009 --> 13:09.279
DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE THAT

13:10.000 --> 13:10.279
DECISION, YOU NEED TO FIND

13:11.000 --> 13:12.019
ANOTHER JOB."

13:12.039 --> 13:14.120
THAT GROSS MAN IS ACTUALLY

13:14.139 --> 13:15.120
CALLED DAVE GROSSMAN, AND HE

13:15.139 --> 13:17.000
CALLS HIMSELF AN EXPERT IN

13:17.019 --> 13:20.200
"KILLOLOGY," A TERM HE INVENTED,

13:20.220 --> 13:22.049
AND DEFINES AS THE SCHOLARLY

13:22.070 --> 13:23.100
STUDY OF THE DESTRUCTIVE ACT,

13:23.120 --> 13:24.039
JUST AS SEXOLOGY IS THE

13:24.059 --> 13:24.259
SCHOLARLY STUDY OF THE

13:24.279 --> 13:27.169
PROCREATIVE ACT.

13:27.190 --> 13:29.070
WHICH: UGH.

13:29.090 --> 13:31.059
AND ALSO: I'M PRETTY SURE THE

13:31.080 --> 13:32.259
FIRST LESSON IN SEXOLOGY IS

13:32.279 --> 13:34.289
"NEVER CALL SEX THE PROCREATIVE

13:35.009 --> 13:36.029
ACT, IF YOU WANT ANYONE TO

13:36.049 --> 13:37.029
PROCREATIVELY ACT WITH YOU EVER

13:37.049 --> 13:38.110
AGAIN."

13:38.129 --> 13:39.240
AND AS BATSHIT AS GROSSMAN IS,

13:39.259 --> 13:41.080
HE'S BY NO MEANS A FRINGE FIGURE

13:41.100 --> 13:42.190
IN POLICE CULTURE.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.240
HE'S ON THE ROAD GIVING

13:43.259 --> 13:45.269
TRAININGS 200 DAYS A YEAR.

13:45.289 --> 13:46.220
THE OFFICER WHO SHOT

13:46.240 --> 13:49.009
PHILANDO CASTILE HAD TAKEN

13:49.029 --> 13:50.149
A CLASS BASED ON GROSSMAN'S

13:50.169 --> 13:51.110
THEORIES.

13:51.129 --> 13:52.080
AND WHEN, IN THE WAKE OF THAT

13:52.100 --> 13:54.169
SHOOTING, THE MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR

13:54.190 --> 13:55.240
BANNED OFFICERS FROM

13:55.259 --> 13:57.120
PARTICIPATING IN WARRIOR-STYLE

13:57.139 --> 13:58.000
TRAINING, THE HEAD OF

13:58.019 --> 13:59.100
THE POLICE UNION THERE,

13:59.120 --> 14:00.159
BOB KROLL, ANNOUNCED PLANS

14:00.179 --> 14:02.179
TO DEFY THAT DECISION.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.100
>> IF THEY DEEM THAT THIS

14:04.120 --> 14:06.049
TRAINING IS IN VIOLATION AND

14:06.070 --> 14:07.129
THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN TIME AND

14:07.149 --> 14:09.230
THEY WANT TO ATTEND IT, I'M

14:09.250 --> 14:10.159
GONNA ENCOURAGE OFFICERS TO

14:10.179 --> 14:11.120
DO IT.

14:11.139 --> 14:12.059
I MYSELF WILL BE THE FIRST ONE

14:12.080 --> 14:13.009
TO DO IT.

14:13.029 --> 14:14.070
IF I WOULD BE DISCIPLINED,

14:14.090 --> 14:17.090
IT WOULD NEVER BE UPHELD.

14:17.110 --> 14:19.070
>> John: I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

14:19.090 --> 14:20.179
WHAT'S MORE ALARMING THERE: HIS

14:20.200 --> 14:21.059
DETERMINATION TO TRAIN POLICE

14:21.080 --> 14:22.159
OFFICERS TO BE PREDATORS, HIS

14:22.179 --> 14:23.080
AIR OF CASUAL IMPUNITY, OR THE

14:23.100 --> 14:25.139
FACT THAT HE HAS A SIGN IN HIS

14:25.159 --> 14:26.139
OFFICE THAT SAYS "LET ME DROP

14:26.159 --> 14:27.080
"EVERYTHING" AND WORK ON YOUR

14:27.100 --> 14:28.059
PROBLEM."

14:28.080 --> 14:30.070
WHICH IS ALWAYS THE OFFICE DECOR

14:30.090 --> 14:31.110
CHOICE OF A GRADE-A ASSHOLE, BUT

14:31.129 --> 14:33.159
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMEONE WHOSE

14:33.179 --> 14:34.149
ACTUAL JOB IS TO WORK ON OTHER

14:34.169 --> 14:36.129
PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS.

14:36.149 --> 14:37.240
AND THAT CONFIDENCE THAT HE'S

14:37.259 --> 14:42.039
ABOVE PUNISHMENT ACTUALLY BRINGS

14:42.059 --> 14:43.139
US TO THE SECOND POINT WE WANT

14:43.159 --> 14:44.009
TO LOOK AT TONIGHT: WHAT THE

14:44.029 --> 14:44.200
MAJOR OBSTACLES TO REFORM HAVE

14:44.220 --> 14:45.080
BEEN.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.269
BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

14:46.289 --> 14:48.210
ISSUES IS POLICE UNIONS.

14:48.230 --> 14:50.039
EVEN IN CITIES WHERE THE MAYOR

14:50.059 --> 14:50.259
AND POLICE CHIEF SAY ALL THE

14:50.279 --> 14:52.210
RIGHT THINGS, IT'S IMPORTANT

14:52.230 --> 14:56.190
TO KNOW THAT THE UNION CAN STOP

14:56.210 --> 14:57.159
WHATEVER THEY ARE PROPOSING

14:57.179 --> 14:58.110
DEAD IN ITS TRACKS.

14:58.129 --> 14:59.090
AND UNIONS CAN MAKE IT

14:59.110 --> 15:00.039
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

15:00.059 --> 15:01.179
TO DISCIPLINE OFFICERS,

15:01.200 --> 15:03.100
EVEN FOR EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.240
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED IN

15:04.259 --> 15:06.179
MINNEAPOLIS, WITH TWO OFFICERS

15:06.200 --> 15:07.139
WHO BELONG TO OUR FRIEND BOB'S

15:07.159 --> 15:08.080
UNION.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.009
>> TWO MINNEAPOLIS POLICE

15:10.029 --> 15:12.070
OFFICERS ARE ON PAID LEAVE FOR

15:12.090 --> 15:14.000
ALLEGEDLY DECORATING A CHRISTMAS

15:14.019 --> 15:15.149
TREE AT THE 4TH PRECINCT WITH

15:15.169 --> 15:16.110
A BUNCH OF ITEMS THAT ARE VIEWED

15:16.129 --> 15:18.009
AS RACIST.

15:18.029 --> 15:20.240
BAGS OF HOT TAKI CHIPS, A CUP

15:20.259 --> 15:22.240
FROM POPEYES FRIED CHICKEN,

15:22.259 --> 15:24.240
MENTHOL CIGARETTES AND CANS OF

15:24.259 --> 15:28.159
MALT LIQUOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

15:28.179 --> 15:29.120
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

15:29.139 --> 15:30.159
THAT IS NOT JUST DISGUSTING, IT

15:30.179 --> 15:31.129
IS ALSO ARGUABLY THE MOST RACIST

15:31.149 --> 15:32.100
THING TO HAPPEN TO CHRISTMAS

15:32.120 --> 15:33.149
SINCE PEOPLE DECIDED THIS CHILD

15:33.169 --> 15:34.149
BORN IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS

15:34.169 --> 15:36.139
WHITE.

15:36.159 --> 15:38.149
AND NOT ONLY DOES THAT INCIDENT

15:38.169 --> 15:39.159
RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT

15:39.179 --> 15:41.009
THOSE OFFICERS, IT ALSO

15:41.029 --> 15:42.190
IMPLICATES THE ENTIRE PRECINCT,

15:42.210 --> 15:44.009
BECAUSE THEY PRESUMABLY THOUGHT

15:44.029 --> 15:45.129
NONE OF THEIR COWORKERS WOULD

15:45.149 --> 15:46.080
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT THEY

15:46.100 --> 15:46.220
DID.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.250
AND TO HIS CREDIT,

15:47.269 --> 15:49.090
WHEN THAT STORY BROKE,

15:49.110 --> 15:50.169
THE MAYOR OF MINNEAPOLIS

15:50.190 --> 15:53.070
ANNOUNCED THE OFFICERS

15:53.090 --> 15:56.049
RESPONSIBLE WOULD

15:56.070 --> 15:58.039
BE FIRED BY THE END OF THE DAY

15:58.059 --> 15:59.009
ONLY TO ALMOST HAVE TO

15:59.029 --> 16:00.110
IMMEDIATELY WALK THAT STATEMENT

16:00.129 --> 16:01.169
BACK, SAYING THERE WAS A PROCESS

16:01.190 --> 16:02.169
THEY WERE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH

16:02.190 --> 16:04.000
BY LAW.

16:04.019 --> 16:04.230
WE ACTUALLY CHECKED.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.059
DESPITE THE FACT IT'S NOW BEEN A

16:06.080 --> 16:08.190
YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THAT

16:08.210 --> 16:10.110
HAPPENED, ONE OF THOSE

16:10.129 --> 16:10.190
OFFICERS'

16:10.210 --> 16:11.059
CASES IS STILL UNDER

16:11.080 --> 16:11.250
ARBITRATION.

16:11.269 --> 16:12.240
AND, LOOK, I GET UNIONS FIGHTING

16:12.259 --> 16:14.009
FOR THEIR WORKERS -- THAT IS

16:14.029 --> 16:15.029
WHAT THEY DO.

16:15.049 --> 16:16.149
BUT POLICE UNIONS TAKE THAT

16:16.169 --> 16:18.159
TO A DANGEROUS EXTREME,

16:18.179 --> 16:19.129
AND NEGOTIATE LANGUAGE INTO

16:19.149 --> 16:20.149
CONTRACTS THAT MAKES REMOVING

16:20.169 --> 16:22.269
A PROBLEM OFFICER INCREDIBLY

16:22.289 --> 16:23.049
DIFFICULT.

16:23.070 --> 16:24.090
A "WASHINGTON POST" ANALYSIS OF

16:24.110 --> 16:26.080
SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST

16:26.100 --> 16:30.269
POLICE DEPARTMENTS FOUND THAT

16:30.289 --> 16:32.110
THEY'D FIRED AT LEAST 1881

16:32.129 --> 16:33.100
OFFICERS FOR MISCONDUCT, BUT

16:33.120 --> 16:35.029
WERE FORCED TO REINSTATE MORE

16:35.049 --> 16:36.039
THAN 450 OF THEM -- ALMOST 25%

16:36.059 --> 16:37.120
-- AFTER APPEALS REQUIRED BY

16:37.139 --> 16:39.149
THEIR UNION CONTRACTS.

16:39.169 --> 16:40.169
AND POLICE UNIONS CAN ALSO

16:40.190 --> 16:42.029
OPPOSE EVEN THE MOST BASIC,

16:42.049 --> 16:43.149
COMMON-SENSE REFORM.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.220
A FEW YEARS BACK, THE CLEVELAND

16:45.240 --> 16:46.240
POLICE STARTED BEING REQUIRED

16:46.259 --> 16:48.029
TO FILE A REPORT EVERY TIME THEY

16:48.049 --> 16:50.259
UNHOLSTERED AND POINTED THEIR

16:50.279 --> 16:52.139
GUN AT SOMEONE, AND THEIR UNION

16:52.159 --> 16:54.159
HEAD WAS ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.230
>> I'M AFRAID THAT OFFICERS ARE

16:55.250 --> 16:57.250
GONNA BE HESITANT TO PULL THEIR

16:57.269 --> 16:59.279
GUN IN AN APPROPRIATE SITUATION

17:00.000 --> 17:01.120
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANNA DO THE

17:01.139 --> 17:02.250
PAPERWORK THAT'S GONNA BE

17:02.269 --> 17:03.139
ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING TO PULL

17:03.159 --> 17:04.019
YOUR GUN.

17:04.039 --> 17:05.289
>> John: OKAY, FIRST:

17:06.009 --> 17:07.240
THE IDEA THAT THE RISK OF

17:07.259 --> 17:10.029
PAPERWORK IS A GREATER DETERRENT

17:10.049 --> 17:10.269
TO POLICE OFFICERS DRAWING THEIR

17:10.289 --> 17:11.210
GUN THAN THE RISK OF KILLING

17:11.230 --> 17:12.210
SOMEONE IS LEGITIMATELY

17:12.230 --> 17:14.000
TERRIFYING.

17:14.019 --> 17:15.140
AND IT'S HARD TO TAKE THAT GLIB

17:15.160 --> 17:17.069
DISMISSAL FROM ANYONE, LET ALONE

17:17.089 --> 17:19.069
SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE A BOILED

17:19.089 --> 17:20.069
MR. POTATO HEAD, OR AN ANGRY EGG

17:20.089 --> 17:22.059
WITH A MUSTACHE.

17:22.079 --> 17:22.279
AND I KNOW THOSE COMPARISONS

17:23.000 --> 17:23.170
PROBABLY MAKE HIM MAD, BUT

17:23.190 --> 17:24.190
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO, SHOOT ME?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.059
I DON'T THINK SO!

17:26.079 --> 17:27.269
THINK OF THE PAPERWORK INVOLVED.

17:27.289 --> 17:29.089
AND THAT ATTITUDE IS

17:29.109 --> 17:31.039
PARTICULARLY HARD TO TAKE,

17:31.059 --> 17:32.279
CONSIDERING THAT JUST SIX MONTHS

17:33.000 --> 17:34.180
PREVIOUSLY, TAMIR RICE HAD BEEN

17:34.200 --> 17:35.210
KILLED BY A CLEVELAND POLICE

17:35.230 --> 17:37.109
OFFICER.

17:37.130 --> 17:38.200
AND WHEN FACED WITH

17:38.220 --> 17:40.089
ACCOUNTABILITY THEY DON'T LIKE,

17:40.109 --> 17:42.079
UNIONS WILL OFTEN ISSUE THE

17:42.099 --> 17:43.180
ULTIMATE THREAT: TO SIMPLY PULL

17:43.200 --> 17:44.259
BACK AND LET CRIME RISE.

17:44.279 --> 17:47.130
FOR INSTANCE, LISTEN TO HOW

17:47.150 --> 17:49.019
THE HEAD OF NEW YORK CITY'S

17:49.039 --> 17:50.240
LARGEST POLICE UNION REACTED

17:50.259 --> 17:52.009
WHEN A JUDGE RECOMMENDED FIRING

17:52.029 --> 17:52.269
THE OFFICER WHOSE CHOKEHOLD LED

17:52.289 --> 17:54.200
TO THE DEATH OF ERIC GARNER.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.019
>> THE CRIMINAL ADVOCATES HAVE

17:56.039 --> 17:58.130
GOTTEN WHAT THEY WANT.

17:58.150 --> 18:01.049
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS FROZEN.

18:01.069 --> 18:03.130
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN'T STOP

18:03.150 --> 18:04.200
THE KILLERS, THEY CAN'T STOP

18:04.220 --> 18:07.079
THE CRIMINALS, THEY CAN'T

18:07.099 --> 18:10.049
EFFECTIVELY DO THEIR JOB.

18:10.069 --> 18:11.190
I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO

18:11.210 --> 18:12.269
TELL OUR POLICE OFFICERS, "TAKE

18:12.289 --> 18:14.170
IT A STEP SLOWER."

18:14.190 --> 18:15.140
>> John: "TAKE IT A STEP

18:15.160 --> 18:17.119
SLOWER."

18:17.140 --> 18:19.079
HE JUST BASICALLY THREATENED

18:19.099 --> 18:20.289
INACTION AGAINST "THE KILLERS"

18:21.009 --> 18:22.130
AS A BARGAINING CHIP.

18:22.150 --> 18:24.009
AND BESIDES THAT BEING MORALLY

18:24.029 --> 18:30.119
REPREHENSIBLE, IT'S A TOOL MOST

18:30.140 --> 18:32.019
LABOR UNIONS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE

18:32.039 --> 18:34.200
AT THEIR DISPOSAL.

18:34.220 --> 18:35.250
WHEN THE UNIONS REPRESENTING TV

18:35.269 --> 18:36.210
WRITERS FIGHT FOR THEIR MEMBERS,

18:36.230 --> 18:37.240
THE WORST THING THEY CAN

18:37.259 --> 18:38.140
THREATEN THE PUBLIC WITH IS

18:38.160 --> 18:39.150
FEWER EPISODES OF "BULL," OR

18:39.170 --> 18:40.269
"THE BLACKLIST," OR THIS SHOW.

18:40.289 --> 18:41.259
AND THAT'S JUST NOT A COMPELLING

18:41.279 --> 18:42.210
ARGUMENT.

18:42.230 --> 18:44.140
AND THAT WASN'T EVEN AN EMPTY

18:44.160 --> 18:45.190
THREAT, BECAUSE FOLLOWING THAT

18:45.210 --> 18:46.170
STATEMENT, POLICING DID SLOW

18:46.190 --> 18:47.089
DOWN IN NEW YORK FOR A BIT

18:47.109 --> 18:47.279
LAST YEAR.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.099
THERE WAS AN 11% DROP IN

18:49.119 --> 18:51.009
FELONY ARRESTS, AN 18% DROP

18:51.029 --> 18:53.220
IN MISDEMEANOR ARRESTS, AND

18:53.240 --> 18:56.019
A 32% DROP IN MOVING VIOLATIONS.

18:56.039 --> 18:58.160
BUT THE THING IS: IF YOU LIVED

18:58.180 --> 19:00.019
IN NEW YORK THEN, YOU PROBABLY

19:00.039 --> 19:03.170
DON'T REMEMBER IT AS THE TIME

19:03.190 --> 19:04.119
THAT THE CITY DEVOLVED INTO

19:04.140 --> 19:04.289
CHAOS.

19:05.009 --> 19:06.000
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.069
PEOPLE STILL WENT ABOUT THEIR

19:07.089 --> 19:08.240
LIVES, SUBWAYS WERE STILL AS

19:08.259 --> 19:09.130
DELAYED AS THEY USUALLY WERE,

19:09.150 --> 19:11.009
AND RATS STILL DRAGGED SLICES OF

19:11.029 --> 19:12.019
PIZZA UP STAIRS TO FEED THEIR

19:12.039 --> 19:13.130
RAT FAMILIES AFTER A HARD DAY OF

19:13.150 --> 19:15.029
RAT WORK.

19:15.049 --> 19:16.039
MAKING YOU WONDER WHETHER ALL

19:16.059 --> 19:17.099
THOSE ARRESTS WERE REALLY

19:17.119 --> 19:18.200
IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY

19:18.220 --> 19:20.089
AT ALL.

19:20.109 --> 19:23.000
NOW, ONE GOOD WAY TO ATTEMPT TO

19:23.019 --> 19:25.039
GET REFORMS PAST A UNION'S

19:25.059 --> 19:28.009
RESISTANCE IS IF THE FEDERAL

19:28.029 --> 19:29.019
GOVERNMENT STEPS IN, WHICH IT

19:29.039 --> 19:29.289
ACTUALLY CAN.

19:30.009 --> 19:31.210
IT HAS THE POWER TO INVESTIGATE

19:31.230 --> 19:32.160
POLICE DEPARTMENTS FOR A PATTERN

19:32.180 --> 19:36.049
OF CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND

19:36.069 --> 19:37.099
ENTER WHAT IS CALLED A "CONSENT

19:37.119 --> 19:38.029
DECREE," IN WHICH THE POLICE

19:38.049 --> 19:39.009
DEPARTMENT AGREES TO MAKE

19:39.029 --> 19:40.029
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT

19:40.049 --> 19:41.000
ARE THEN OVERSEEN BY

19:41.019 --> 19:42.240
A FEDERAL COURT.

19:42.259 --> 19:44.099
THAT CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL

19:44.119 --> 19:45.150
TO FORCE CHANGE.

19:45.170 --> 19:46.180
IN FACT, THAT PAPERWORK

19:46.200 --> 19:48.190
REQUIREMENT IN CLEVELAND THAT

19:48.210 --> 19:50.039
PISSED OFF THIS EGG?

19:50.059 --> 19:52.049
THAT CAME FROM A CONSENT DECREE.

19:52.069 --> 19:54.279
THE PROBLEM IS, HOW OR EVEN

19:55.000 --> 19:58.089
WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT DOES THAT

19:58.109 --> 19:59.009
DEPENDS ON WHO IS RUNNING IT.

19:59.029 --> 20:00.029
AND RIGHT NOW, IT'S THIS WILDLY

20:00.049 --> 20:01.200
UNSUCCESSFUL BIBLE SALESMAN.

20:01.220 --> 20:03.039
AND HE CLEARLY HAS NO INTEREST

20:03.059 --> 20:04.190
IN POLICE REFORM.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.240
IN GEORGE W. BUSH'S FIRST TERM,

20:06.259 --> 20:08.059
HIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAUNCHED

20:08.079 --> 20:09.140
12 SUCH INVESTIGATIONS INTO

20:09.160 --> 20:10.119
POLICE DEPARTMENTS.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.119
IN OBAMA'S FIRST TERM, IT WAS

20:11.140 --> 20:14.009
15.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.160
TRUMP'S D.O.J. HAS LAUNCHED JUST

20:15.180 --> 20:17.079
A SINGLE INVESTIGATION, AND HAS

20:17.099 --> 20:18.279
ENTERED ZERO CONSENT DECREES.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.279
MEANWHILE, TRUMP HIMSELF HAS

20:21.000 --> 20:22.009
MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR WHERE

20:22.029 --> 20:23.059
HE STANDS ON THE POLICE USE OF

20:23.079 --> 20:24.150
FORCE.

20:24.170 --> 20:26.039
HE NOT ONLY ROLLED BACK OBAMA'S

20:26.059 --> 20:26.279
RESTRICTIONS ON GIVING THE

20:27.000 --> 20:28.049
POLICE MILITARY EQUIPMENT,

20:28.069 --> 20:29.109
JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID TO

20:29.130 --> 20:30.200
AN AUDIENCE FILLED WITH

20:30.220 --> 20:32.130
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

20:32.150 --> 20:35.140
>> PLEASE DON'T BE TOO NICE.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.250
LIKE WHEN YOU GUYS PUT SOMEBODY

20:37.269 --> 20:39.190
IN THE CAR AND YOU'RE PROTECTING

20:39.210 --> 20:41.059
THEIR HEAD, YOU KNOW, THE WAY

20:41.079 --> 20:43.220
YOU PUT YOUR HAND OVER IT.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.140
LIKE, DON'T HIT THEIR HEAD, AND

20:45.160 --> 20:46.190
THEY'VE JUST KILLED SOMEBODY.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.029
DON'T HIT THEIR HEAD.

20:47.049 --> 20:47.210
I SAID, YOU CAN TAKE THE HAND

20:47.230 --> 20:53.259
AWAY, OKAY?

20:53.279 --> 20:54.269
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

20:54.289 --> 20:59.180
>> John: WOW.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.200
YOU KNOW, IT'S BAD ENOUGH WHEN

21:01.220 --> 21:03.109
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF RANDOM

21:03.130 --> 21:07.069
SHITHEADS CHEERING ON TRUMP'S

21:07.089 --> 21:08.069
LAWLESS RHETORIC,

21:08.089 --> 21:09.089
IT'S A LOT MORE

21:09.109 --> 21:10.150
ALARMING WHEN THE APPLAUSE IS

21:10.170 --> 21:11.059
COMING FROM THE PEOPLE WHOSE

21:11.079 --> 21:12.109
SOLE JOB IS TO SEE LAWLESSNESS

21:12.130 --> 21:13.079
AND STOP IT.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.140
SO IF THE UNIONS WON'T ACT, AND

21:14.160 --> 21:15.130
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T

21:15.150 --> 21:16.089
ACT, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO,

21:16.109 --> 21:17.059
AS A CIVILIAN, TO GET

21:17.079 --> 21:18.000
ACCOUNTABILITY IF THE POLICE

21:18.019 --> 21:19.000
VIOLATED YOUR RIGHTS?

21:19.019 --> 21:20.089
WELL, YOU COULD TRY AND SUE THE

21:20.109 --> 21:21.210
CITY, OR THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICER

21:21.230 --> 21:22.210
IN QUESTION.

21:22.230 --> 21:23.210
AND IN HIGH-PROFILE CASES

21:23.230 --> 21:24.200
ESPECIALLY, THEY CAN BE

21:24.220 --> 21:25.140
INCENTIVIZED TO SETTLE FOR

21:25.160 --> 21:26.130
ASTONISHING AMOUNTS.

21:26.150 --> 21:29.150
IN FACT, OVER A PERIOD OF

21:29.170 --> 21:31.059
FIVE YEARS, THE TEN CITIES WITH

21:31.079 --> 21:33.059
THE LARGEST POLICE DEPARTMENTS

21:33.079 --> 21:35.099
PAID OUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN

21:35.119 --> 21:36.150
SETTLEMENTS AND COURT JUDGMENTS.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.180
AND LISTEN, I'M NO COMPTROLLER.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.109
BELIEVE ME -- I WISH I WERE.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.079
A HARD-TO-EXPLAIN, LETHALLY

21:42.099 --> 21:44.049
BORING, ELECTED ACCOUNTANT WHOSE

21:44.069 --> 21:45.000
TITLE INEXPLICABLY TOOK A REAL

21:45.019 --> 21:45.220
WORD AND STUCK AN "MP" IN THE

21:45.240 --> 21:46.039
MIDDLE OF IT?

21:46.059 --> 21:48.099
COME ON!

21:48.119 --> 21:50.000
THAT'S MY DREAM JOMPB.

21:50.019 --> 21:51.089
BUT EVEN I CAN TELL YOU:

21:51.109 --> 21:52.140
IF YOU'RE SPENDING A BILLION

21:52.160 --> 21:53.170
DOLLARS ON MISCONDUCT

21:53.190 --> 21:54.259
SETTLEMENTS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO

21:54.279 --> 21:55.170
SERIOUSLY EXAMINE WHAT CONDUCT

21:55.190 --> 21:56.230
LOOKS LIKE.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.150
AND IF A CITY DOESN'T FEEL IT

21:58.170 --> 22:00.170
HAS TO SETTLE WITH YOU, YOU'RE

22:00.190 --> 22:03.009
IN REAL TROUBLE, BECAUSE CIVIL

22:03.029 --> 22:03.190
SUITS AGAINST COPS ARE NEARLY

22:03.210 --> 22:04.130
IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.160
JUST LISTEN TO A DEFENSE

22:05.180 --> 22:07.089
ATTORNEY EXPLAIN ONE REASON IT

22:07.109 --> 22:08.259
WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR

22:08.279 --> 22:10.019
MICHAEL BROWN'S FAMILY TO SUE

22:10.039 --> 22:10.259
THE FERGUSON OFFICER WHO KILLED

22:10.279 --> 22:11.240
HIM.

22:11.259 --> 22:12.170
>> CIVILLY, SURE, THEY COULD GO

22:12.190 --> 22:14.039
AFTER HIM CIVILLY.

22:14.059 --> 22:14.269
THE PROBLEM IS HE HAS QUALIFIED

22:15.000 --> 22:15.259
IMMUNITY.

22:15.279 --> 22:17.099
HE'S GONNA SAY THAT "I WAS

22:17.119 --> 22:18.140
ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF MY

22:18.160 --> 22:19.119
EMPLOYMENT, THIS IS WHAT I WAS

22:19.140 --> 22:24.190
DOING."

22:24.210 --> 22:27.039
>> John: YEAH, AND HE'S RIGHT

22:27.059 --> 22:27.130
ABOUT THAT.

22:27.150 --> 22:28.069
POLICE OFFICERS ARE OFTEN

22:28.089 --> 22:29.059
PROTECTED FROM CONSEQUENCES

22:29.079 --> 22:30.250
DUE TO SOMETHING CALLED

22:30.269 --> 22:31.079
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.

22:31.099 --> 22:31.269
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU

22:31.289 --> 22:32.160
GET FROM A HORRIFYING CHEAT CODE

22:32.180 --> 22:33.089
IN "GRAND THEFT AUTO."

22:33.109 --> 22:34.019
"GUESS WHAT?

22:34.039 --> 22:35.039
I TURNED ON QUALIFIED IMMUNITY

22:35.059 --> 22:36.019
AND NOW MY CAR RUNS ON

22:36.039 --> 22:36.289
PROSTITUTES!"

22:37.009 --> 22:38.039
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH TAKING A

22:38.059 --> 22:39.119
MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THAT TERM.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.029
VERY BASICALLY, QUALIFIED

22:41.049 --> 22:42.269
IMMUNITY MEANS THAT A PUBLIC

22:42.289 --> 22:43.240
OFFICIAL IS IMMUNE FROM

22:43.259 --> 22:45.140
LAWSUITS, UNLESS THEIR EXACT

22:45.160 --> 22:47.039
CONDUCT HAS ALREADY BEEN RULED

22:47.059 --> 22:50.269
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN A PREVIOUS

22:50.289 --> 22:53.029
CASE.

22:53.049 --> 22:57.250
AND I DO MEAN EXACT.

22:57.269 --> 22:59.279
BECAUSE SMALL, TINY VARIATIONS

23:00.000 --> 23:00.250
THROWN OUT.

23:00.269 --> 23:01.259
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

23:01.279 --> 23:02.190
FOR INSTANCE, ONE CASE WAS

23:02.210 --> 23:03.180
THROWN OUT BECAUSE OF THE

23:03.200 --> 23:04.210
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNLEASHING

23:04.230 --> 23:05.250
A POLICE DOG TO BITE A

23:05.269 --> 23:06.250
MOTIONLESS SUSPECT IN A BUSHY

23:06.269 --> 23:08.019
RAVINE, AND UNLEASHING A POLICE

23:08.039 --> 23:09.059
DOG TO BITE A COMPLIANT SUSPECT

23:09.079 --> 23:10.230
IN A CANAL IN THE WOODS.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.160
WHICH I TOTALLY GET -- THOSE ARE

23:12.180 --> 23:13.250
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KINDS

23:13.269 --> 23:15.170
OF OUTDOOR HOLES.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.099
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS CASE:

23:17.119 --> 23:19.019
>> A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT HAS

23:19.039 --> 23:20.059
RULED SEATTLE POLICE USED

23:20.079 --> 23:21.099
EXCESSIVE FORCE WHEN THEY

23:21.119 --> 23:22.190
TASERED A PREGNANT WOMAN DURING

23:22.210 --> 23:25.009
A TRAFFIC STOP IN 2004.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.200
SHE WAS SHOCKED THREE TIMES WITH

23:26.220 --> 23:28.130
A STUN GUN FOR REFUSING TO SIGN

23:28.150 --> 23:30.059
A SPEEDING TICKET.

23:30.079 --> 23:31.210
ALTHOUGH THE RULING WAS IN

23:31.230 --> 23:33.019
BROOKS' FAVOR, THE OFFICER WHO

23:33.039 --> 23:36.059
FIRED THE TASER WAS GIVEN

23:36.079 --> 23:37.089
IMMUNITY BECAUSE THE LAW ON STUN

23:37.109 --> 23:38.170
GUN USE WAS NOT CLEAR YET.

23:38.190 --> 23:39.190
>> John: THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

23:39.210 --> 23:41.289
RIDICULOUS.

23:42.009 --> 23:43.079
THE METHOD THE OFFICER USED TO

23:43.099 --> 23:44.099
ASSAULT THAT WOMAN CLEARLY

23:44.119 --> 23:45.259
SHOULDN'T MATTER.

23:45.279 --> 23:47.009
IT'S LIKE IF JEFFREY DAHMER WAS

23:47.029 --> 23:48.009
DECLARED INNOCENT BECAUSE

23:48.029 --> 23:48.240
HE COOKED HIS VICTIMS

23:48.259 --> 23:51.190
IN AN INSTANT POT.

23:51.210 --> 23:52.160
THE CRIME IS THE KILLING, NOT

23:52.180 --> 23:56.099
WHAT FUCKING APPLIANCE HE USED.

23:56.119 --> 23:58.089
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THERE'S

23:58.109 --> 23:59.160
A CHANCE THE SUPREME COURT WILL

23:59.180 --> 24:00.140
SOON DECIDE TO RECONSIDER

24:00.160 --> 24:01.109
QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.

24:01.130 --> 24:02.240
THERE'S ACTUALLY A BILL IN

24:02.259 --> 24:03.119
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW TO ABOLISH

24:03.140 --> 24:04.200
IT.

24:04.220 --> 24:06.099
ALTHOUGH, EVEN IF IT PASSES,

24:06.119 --> 24:07.130
IT MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR

24:07.150 --> 24:08.190
A NEW PRESIDENT TO SIGN IT.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.039
AND WE MAY NOT GET ONE OF THOSE

24:10.059 --> 24:11.049
ANYWHERE FROM THE NEXT FOUR

24:11.069 --> 24:12.119
YEARS TO NEVER.

24:12.140 --> 24:14.250
BUT WHILE ENDING QUALIFIED

24:14.269 --> 24:18.039
IMMUNITY WOULD BE GREAT, THAT

24:18.059 --> 24:19.069
ALONE ISN'T GONNA BE NEARLY

24:19.089 --> 24:19.140
ENOUGH.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.180
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

24:20.200 --> 24:22.160
POINT: WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

24:22.180 --> 24:24.039
THERE ARE A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS

24:24.059 --> 24:27.000
TO LOOK AT HERE.

24:27.019 --> 24:28.049
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME PROMINENT

24:28.069 --> 24:29.150
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN SPITBALLING

24:29.170 --> 24:31.119
IDEAS THAT ARE EMBARRASSINGLY

24:31.140 --> 24:32.089
SMALL, PERHAPS NONE MORE

24:32.109 --> 24:34.200
RIDICULOUS THAN THIS:

24:34.220 --> 24:36.140
>> AND THE IDEA THAT OF INSTEAD

24:36.160 --> 24:38.259
OF STANDING THERE AND TEACHING

24:38.279 --> 24:40.200
A COP WHEN THERE'S AN UNARMED

24:40.220 --> 24:41.279
PERSON COMIN' AT 'EM WITH A

24:42.000 --> 24:43.140
KNIFE OR SOMETHING, TO SHOOT 'EM

24:43.160 --> 24:44.079
IN THE LEG INSTEAD OF THE HEART

24:44.099 --> 24:45.119
IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING.

24:45.140 --> 24:46.170
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

24:46.190 --> 24:47.220
THINGS THAT CAN CHANGE.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.190
>> John: WOW.

24:50.210 --> 24:52.119
THAT LACK OF IMAGINATION IS

24:52.140 --> 24:53.140
NOT PARTICULARLY INSPIRING,

24:53.160 --> 24:54.279
BUT ALSO: NOT PARTICULARLY

24:55.000 --> 24:55.250
SURPRISING COMING FROM

24:55.269 --> 24:56.289
JOE BIDEN, WHO IS TRULY THE

24:57.009 --> 24:58.130
"GETTING SHOT IN THE LEG INSTEAD

24:58.150 --> 24:59.049
OF THE HEART" CANDIDATE

24:59.069 --> 25:03.279
RIGHT NOW.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.079
AND WHILE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

25:07.099 --> 25:07.269
ABSURD, THE INSTINCT BIDEN JUST

25:07.289 --> 25:08.180
DISPLAYED --

25:08.200 --> 25:09.190
THAT THE KEY QUESTION IS NOT IF

25:09.210 --> 25:10.220
AN OFFICER SHOULD SHOOT SOMEONE,

25:10.240 --> 25:11.200
BUT WHERE -- IS SHARED BY MANY

25:11.220 --> 25:12.210
POLITICIANS.

25:12.230 --> 25:14.000
IN NEW YORK, BILL DE BLASIO HAS

25:14.019 --> 25:15.069
BALKED AT MAKING IT ILLEGAL FOR

25:15.089 --> 25:16.140
POLICE TO USE CHOKEHOLDS,

25:16.160 --> 25:17.150
DESPITE THE FACT THAT

25:17.170 --> 25:19.140
A CHOKEHOLD IS PRECISELY WHAT

25:19.160 --> 25:20.289
LED TO THE DEATH OF ERIC GARNER.

25:21.009 --> 25:23.109
BUT THE FACT IS, THE INCREMENTAL

25:23.130 --> 25:25.190
REFORMS WE'VE TRIED -- LIKE THE

25:25.210 --> 25:27.089
WIDER USE OF BODY CAMERAS, AND

25:27.109 --> 25:28.049
IMPLICIT BIAS AND USE-OF-FORCE

25:28.069 --> 25:29.150
TRAINING -- ARE NOT, ON THEIR

25:29.170 --> 25:32.000
OWN, GOING TO CUT IT.

25:32.019 --> 25:33.289
AND I'M NOT SAYING WE SHOULDN'T

25:34.009 --> 25:35.250
STILL TRY THEM, BUT IN MANY

25:35.269 --> 25:38.119
CASES, YOU'RE CONTENDING WITH

25:38.140 --> 25:39.119
AN ENTRENCHED POLICE CULTURE

25:39.140 --> 25:43.119
RESISTANT TO ANY EFFORT TO

25:43.140 --> 25:43.220
COMPEL REFORM.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.150
THAT IS WHY MANY ARE ADVOCATING

25:44.170 --> 25:45.140
THAT WE RETHINK POLICE FROM

25:45.160 --> 25:46.119
THE GROUND UP.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.109
ONE SMALL EXAMPLE OF THIS IS

25:47.130 --> 25:48.200
CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, WHICH,

25:48.220 --> 25:50.160
TEN YEARS AGO WAS POLICED

25:50.180 --> 25:51.089
BY A DEEPLY TROUBLED,

25:51.109 --> 25:53.069
CORRUPTION-RIDDEN FORCE.

25:53.089 --> 25:55.200
BUT IN 2013, THEY DISSOLVED

25:55.220 --> 25:57.180
THEIR CITY POLICE FORCE

25:57.200 --> 25:59.000
ENTIRELY, WITH OFFICERS HAVING

25:59.019 --> 26:00.210
TO REAPPLY FOR THEIR JOBS.

26:00.230 --> 26:02.109
AND IN DOING THAT, THEY'VE BEEN

26:02.130 --> 26:03.130
ABLE TO MEANINGFULLY SHIFT THE

26:03.150 --> 26:05.130
CULTURE, WHILE ALSO INSTITUTING

26:05.150 --> 26:07.069
POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE LED TO

26:07.089 --> 26:10.019
BOTH A DROP IN EXCESSIVE-FORCE

26:10.039 --> 26:10.259
COMPLAINTS, AND SOME REBUILDING

26:10.279 --> 26:14.019
OF COMMUNITY TRUST.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.039
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT

26:15.059 --> 26:17.000
IT'S BEEN EASY, PERFECT, OR EVEN

26:17.019 --> 26:18.200
THAT IT WOULD WORK EVERYWHERE.

26:18.220 --> 26:19.279
BUT IT SHOULD EXPAND OUR IDEA OF

26:20.000 --> 26:21.119
WHAT'S POSSIBLE.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.220
ONE EVEN BROADER IDEA THAT'S

26:22.240 --> 26:24.029
GAINING MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW IS

26:24.049 --> 26:26.130
DEFUNDING THE POLICE -- A PHRASE

26:26.150 --> 26:27.180
THAT, ON ITS FACE, MAY SOUND

26:27.200 --> 26:29.000
ALARMING TO SOME.

26:29.019 --> 26:31.000
IN FACT, JUST WATCH THIS

26:31.019 --> 26:33.009
PROFESSIONAL ALARMIST BE

26:33.029 --> 26:34.250
ALARMED, ON HIS VERY BAD FACE:

26:34.269 --> 26:35.200
>> DEFUND THE POLICE.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.259
NO MORE COPS.

26:36.279 --> 26:37.269
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING

26:37.289 --> 26:39.059
FOR.

26:39.079 --> 26:40.190
THAT SEEMS LIKE A FRINGE

26:40.210 --> 26:41.099
POSITION, BUT IN THE DEMOCRATIC

26:41.119 --> 26:43.039
PARTY, IT ISN'T ANYMORE.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.019
IF YOU LIVE IN A GATED

26:44.039 --> 26:45.039
COMMUNITY, IT MIGHT SOUND

26:45.059 --> 26:47.009
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

26:47.029 --> 26:47.220
YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN POLICE

26:47.240 --> 26:49.049
FORCE.

26:49.069 --> 26:51.130
YOU HAVE NO PLANS TO REPLACE

26:51.150 --> 26:52.200
THEM WITH RAPID RESPONSE

26:52.220 --> 26:53.250
SOCIAL WORKERS.

26:53.269 --> 26:55.170
SO YOU'RE SET NO MATTER WHAT

26:55.190 --> 26:55.240
HAPPENS.

26:55.259 --> 26:56.170
THERE AREN'T GOING TO BE ANY

26:56.190 --> 26:58.069
RAPES ON YOUR STREET.

26:58.089 --> 27:00.000
BUT WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE?

27:00.019 --> 27:04.279
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.250
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL --

27:06.269 --> 27:08.029
IN ALL SINCERITY -- TUCKER, YOU

27:08.049 --> 27:08.220
SEEM NERVOUS.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.210
THIS IS A DIFFICULT MOMENT, AND

27:09.230 --> 27:10.279
I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE TAKING TIME

27:11.000 --> 27:12.019
FOR YOURSELF, WHETHER IT'S

27:12.039 --> 27:13.230
THROUGH MEDITATION, YOGA, OR

27:13.250 --> 27:15.150
JUST KIDDING, FUCK YOU FOREVER,

27:15.170 --> 27:18.279
TUCKER CARLSON, YOU SENTIENT

27:19.000 --> 27:20.220
POLO MALLET!

27:20.240 --> 27:22.059
SECOND: GIVEN THE SHOCKINGLY

27:22.079 --> 27:23.069
LOW NUMBER OF RAPE CASES THAT

27:23.089 --> 27:24.000
ACTUALLY RESULT IN CHARGES,

27:24.019 --> 27:25.069
MUCH LESS CONVICTIONS, I REALLY

27:25.089 --> 27:28.009
WOULDN'T BE HOLDING THAT UP AS

27:28.029 --> 27:29.109
PROOF THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS

27:29.130 --> 27:30.099
WORKING WELL.

27:30.119 --> 27:32.210
AND FINALLY: DEFUNDING THE

27:32.230 --> 27:35.029
POLICE ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT MEAN

27:35.049 --> 27:36.259
THAT WE ELIMINATE ALL COPS AND

27:36.279 --> 27:38.259
JUST SUCCUMB TO "THE PURGE."

27:38.279 --> 27:40.039
INSTEAD, IT'S ABOUT MOVING AWAY

27:40.059 --> 27:41.250
FROM A NARROW CONCEPTION OF

27:41.269 --> 27:43.009
"PUBLIC SAFETY" THAT RELIES ON

27:43.029 --> 27:44.140
POLICING AND PUNISHMENT, AND

27:44.160 --> 27:46.099
INVESTING IN A COMMUNITY'S

27:46.119 --> 27:47.079
ACTUAL "SAFETY NET" -- THINGS

27:47.099 --> 27:48.250
LIKE STABLE HOUSING,

27:48.269 --> 27:50.029
MENTAL-HEALTH SERVICES, AND

27:50.049 --> 27:51.269
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.

27:51.289 --> 27:53.109
THE CONCEPT IS THAT THE ROLE OF

27:53.130 --> 27:54.289
THE POLICE CAN THEN

27:55.009 --> 27:58.119
SIGNIFICANTLY SHRINK, BECAUSE

27:58.140 --> 27:59.039
THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING TO THE

27:59.059 --> 28:00.240
HOMELESS, OR TO MENTAL-HEALTH

28:00.259 --> 28:02.259
CALLS, OR ARRESTING CHILDREN IN

28:02.279 --> 28:03.150
SCHOOLS, OR ANY OTHER SITUATION

28:03.170 --> 28:05.059
WHERE THE BEST SOLUTION ISN'T

28:05.079 --> 28:09.269
SOMEONE SHOWING UP WITH A GUN.

28:09.289 --> 28:11.029
THAT IS THE IDEA BEHIND "DEFUND

28:11.049 --> 28:13.039
THE POLICE," IF YOU ACTUALLY

28:13.059 --> 28:14.000
LISTEN TO IT.

28:14.019 --> 28:14.289
WHICH SUGGESTS TUCKER CARLSON

28:15.009 --> 28:15.210
HAS THE EXACT LEVEL OF

28:15.230 --> 28:16.220
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT

28:16.240 --> 28:18.130
THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT

28:18.150 --> 28:19.099
THAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM A MAN WHO

28:19.119 --> 28:20.180
ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE HE JUST SAW

28:20.200 --> 28:21.180
HIS FIRST BLACK BARBIE AND FEELS

28:21.200 --> 28:24.250
CONFUSED, BUT MOSTLY SCARED.

28:24.269 --> 28:26.160
AND LOOK, AS WE KNOW, MANY

28:26.180 --> 28:27.200
POLICE WILL LIKELY RESIST ANY

28:27.220 --> 28:29.170
REDISTRIBUTION, HARD.

28:29.190 --> 28:31.029
POLICE UNIONS OFTEN PAINT

28:31.049 --> 28:32.069
THEMSELVES AS ESSENTIAL,

28:32.089 --> 28:35.130
AND EVERYTHING ELSE AS SOMEHOW

28:35.150 --> 28:35.210
FRIVOLOUS.

28:35.230 --> 28:37.019
IN FACT, REMEMBER BOB KROLL?

28:37.039 --> 28:38.150
WHEN MINNEAPOLIS ASKED HIS UNION

28:38.170 --> 28:44.089
TO ACCEPT A PAY FREEZE DUE TO

28:44.109 --> 28:44.259
COVID-19, HERE IS HOW HE

28:44.279 --> 28:45.220
REACTED:

28:45.240 --> 28:46.190
>> THE FIRST THING WE SAID WAS,

28:46.210 --> 28:47.119
OKAY, LET'S SEE THE BUDGET,

28:47.140 --> 28:51.029
LET'S SEE THE CITY BUDGET.

28:51.049 --> 28:51.210
AND GUYS, THEY'RE PISSING AWAY

28:51.230 --> 28:52.099
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

28:52.119 --> 28:53.039
TO PROJECTS.

28:53.059 --> 28:54.029
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GIVING

28:54.049 --> 28:54.289
$15,000 A YEAR TO THE

28:55.009 --> 28:56.009
TRANSGENDER COORDINATOR

28:56.029 --> 29:00.130
FOR THE CITY.

29:00.150 --> 29:02.089
>> John: ALL RIGHT.

29:02.109 --> 29:03.059
SO, LET'S SET ASIDE

29:03.079 --> 29:04.119
THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE

29:04.140 --> 29:06.279
OFTEN HARASSED -- AND MORE THAN

29:07.000 --> 29:07.160
HALF REPORT SPECIFICALLY BEING

29:07.180 --> 29:08.180
MISTREATED BY THE POLICE.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.190
AND INSTEAD, CONSIDER THAT

29:09.210 --> 29:11.029
THE BUDGET FOR THE MINNEAPOLIS

29:11.049 --> 29:12.029
POLICE DEPARTMENT IS

29:12.049 --> 29:12.269
$193 MILLION, MEANING THAT

29:12.289 --> 29:14.170
$15,000 AMOUNTS TO 0.008% OF

29:14.190 --> 29:16.269
THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET.

29:16.289 --> 29:18.269
AND IF THAT'S PISSING MONEY

29:18.289 --> 29:19.289
AWAY, THE CITY SHOULD SEE A

29:20.009 --> 29:21.099
FUCKING UROLOGIST.

29:21.119 --> 29:22.220
BUT GUYS LIKE BOB ROLLING HIS

29:22.240 --> 29:23.240
EYES AT ANYTHING

29:23.259 --> 29:26.240
TRANSGENDER-RELATED IS EXACTLY

29:26.259 --> 29:27.079
WHY IT'S TIME FOR OUR

29:27.099 --> 29:28.160
CONVERSATION TO GO BEYOND

29:28.180 --> 29:29.130
"HOW SHOULD THE POLICE DO THEIR

29:29.150 --> 29:29.240
JOBS?"

29:29.259 --> 29:31.089
TO "WHAT, REALLY, DO WE WANT

29:31.109 --> 29:34.289
THE ROLE OF THE POLICE TO BE?"

29:35.009 --> 29:36.119
AND TOO MANY STILL SEEM TO THINK

29:36.140 --> 29:37.160
THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF A FEW

29:37.180 --> 29:39.130
BAD ACTORS.

29:39.150 --> 29:41.009
IN FACT, JUST LISTEN TO ONE

29:41.029 --> 29:42.000
OFFICER UNSUCCESSFULLY TO TRY TO

29:42.019 --> 29:46.000
MAKE THAT ARGUMENT TO SOME

29:46.019 --> 29:46.230
PROTESTORS JUST THIS WEEK.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.140
>> ONE BAD HAMBURGER AT

29:47.160 --> 29:48.089
McDONALD'S DOES NOT MAKE

29:48.109 --> 29:50.259
McDONALD'S BAD.

29:50.279 --> 29:53.250
>> WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?

29:53.269 --> 29:55.009
>> John: YEAH, THAT

29:55.029 --> 29:56.000
PROTESTOR'S RIGHT:

29:56.019 --> 29:57.039
WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?

29:57.059 --> 29:58.029
BECAUSE ONE BAD HAMBURGER SHOULD

29:58.049 --> 29:59.099
MEAN A HEALTH INSPECTION.

29:59.119 --> 30:00.210
A FEW BAD HAMBURGERS MIGHT MEAN

30:00.230 --> 30:01.150
THAT McDONALD'S IS GETTING SHUT

30:01.170 --> 30:02.200
DOWN.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.289
AND BAD HAMBURGERS REGULARLY

30:04.009 --> 30:05.049
KILLING PEOPLE ON THE STREET

30:05.069 --> 30:06.250
WOULD MEAN THAT WE'D ALL MAYBE

30:06.269 --> 30:08.180
CONSIDER GOING FUCKING VEGAN.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.289
THIS CLEARLY ISN'T ABOUT

30:11.009 --> 30:12.200
INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS; IT'S ABOUT

30:12.220 --> 30:16.069
A STRUCTURE, BUILT ON SYSTEMIC

30:16.089 --> 30:17.059
RACISM THAT THIS COUNTRY CREATED

30:17.079 --> 30:18.119
INTENTIONALLY AND NOW NEEDS TO

30:18.140 --> 30:22.210
DISMANTLE INTENTIONALLY.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.000
AND REPLACE WITH ONE THAT TAKES

30:24.019 --> 30:25.190
INTO THE ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF

30:25.210 --> 30:26.079
THE PEOPLE THAT IT ACTUALLY

30:26.099 --> 30:26.200
SERVES.

30:26.220 --> 30:27.220
AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE

30:27.240 --> 30:29.000
SUSTAINED PRESSURE AND

30:29.019 --> 30:30.079
ATTENTION OVER A LONG PERIOD OF

30:30.099 --> 30:31.029
TIME FROM ALL OF US.

30:31.049 --> 30:33.019
BLACK COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD TO BE

30:33.039 --> 30:34.140
PERPETUAL ACTIVISTS WHILE ALSO

30:34.160 --> 30:36.279
ROUTINELY BEING DISENFRANCHISED.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.059
IT'S LONG PAST TIME THE REST OF

30:38.079 --> 30:39.079
US JOINED TO MAKE SURE THEIR

30:39.099 --> 30:43.180
VOICES ARE HEARD.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.109
AND ACTED UPON.

30:44.130 --> 30:45.140
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE FAR TOO

30:45.160 --> 30:46.160
EASY FOR NOTHING TO MEANINGFULLY

30:46.180 --> 30:52.000
CHANGE HERE.

30:52.019 --> 30:52.269
THAT IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS HAPPENED

30:52.289 --> 30:53.200
BEFORE.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.190
AFTER THE UNREST IN THE LATE

30:54.210 --> 30:55.079
'60S, A COMMISSION WAS SET UP TO

30:55.099 --> 30:56.269
INVESTIGATE AND ISSUE ADVICE.

30:56.289 --> 30:59.170
MANY OF ITS CONCLUSIONS RESEMBLE

30:59.190 --> 31:00.119
IDEAS -- LIKE POLICE

31:00.140 --> 31:02.059
DEMILITARIZATION AND BROAD

31:02.079 --> 31:02.230
REINVESTMENT IN MARGINALIZED

31:02.250 --> 31:03.119
COMMUNITIES -- THAT ARE STILL

31:03.140 --> 31:04.259
BEING PUSHED TODAY.

31:04.279 --> 31:08.210
TESTIFYING BEFORE THAT

31:08.230 --> 31:09.220
COMMISSION WAS

31:09.240 --> 31:10.269
THE SOCIAL SCIENTIST

31:10.289 --> 31:11.220
KENNETH CLARK, MADE THIS

31:11.240 --> 31:12.190
OBSERVATION, WHICH REMAINS

31:12.210 --> 31:13.049
DEPRESSINGLY TRUE.

31:13.069 --> 31:15.069
HE SAID, "I READ THE REPORT OF

31:15.089 --> 31:16.240
THE 1919 RIOT IN CHICAGO, AND IT

31:16.259 --> 31:17.150
IS AS IF I WERE READING THE

31:17.170 --> 31:19.000
REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATING

31:19.019 --> 31:20.069
COMMITTEE OF THE HARLEM RIOT OF

31:20.089 --> 31:21.119
1935, THE REPORT OF THE

31:21.140 --> 31:22.259
INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE OF THE

31:22.279 --> 31:24.089
HARLEM RIOT OF 1943, THE REPORT

31:24.109 --> 31:26.029
OF THE McCONE COMMISSION OF THE

31:26.049 --> 31:27.130
WATTS RIOT OF 1965.

31:27.150 --> 31:29.230
I MUST AGAIN IN CANDOR SAY TO

31:29.250 --> 31:31.119
YOU, IT IS A KIND OF "ALICE IN

31:31.140 --> 31:32.259
WONDERLAND" WITH THE SAME MOVING

31:32.279 --> 31:35.069
PICTURE RESHOWN OVER AND OVER

31:35.089 --> 31:36.259
AGAIN, THE SAME ANALYSIS, THE

31:36.279 --> 31:38.069
SAME RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE

31:38.089 --> 31:42.039
SAME INACTION."

31:42.059 --> 31:43.089
WE'RE IN THE SAME SHIT NOW THAT

31:43.109 --> 31:44.140
WE WERE IN BACK THEN.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.119
AND IF YOU ARE NOT DIRECTLY

31:46.140 --> 31:47.240
IMPACTED BY IT, IT IS TEMPTING

31:47.259 --> 31:48.220
TO LOOK FOR A REASON TO FEEL

31:48.240 --> 31:50.039
BETTER ABOUT THE WORLD.

31:50.059 --> 31:51.130
TO LOOK AT SOME COPS KNEELING

31:51.150 --> 31:52.049
AND THINK, "OH, WELL, WE JUST

31:52.069 --> 31:54.049
NEED MORE OF THAT!"

31:54.069 --> 31:55.259
BUT WE NEED SO MUCH MORE THAN

31:55.279 --> 31:56.259
THAT.

31:56.279 --> 31:59.250
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A FIRMLY

31:59.269 --> 32:02.029
ENTRENCHED SYSTEM, IN WHICH

32:02.049 --> 32:08.200
THE ROOTS OF WHITE SUPREMACY RUN

32:08.220 --> 32:10.150
ALL GRAB A FUCKING SHOVEL.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.029
TO DO ANYTHING LESS WOULD BE

32:11.049 --> 32:11.250
ABSOLUTELY UNFORGIVABLE.

32:11.269 --> 32:17.049
AND ACTUALLY, TO THAT POINT,

32:17.069 --> 32:18.019
THERE IS ONE PERSON I SAW THIS

32:18.039 --> 32:18.269
WEEK WHOSE WORDS HAVE BEEN

32:18.289 --> 32:19.170
ECHOING AROUND MY HEAD.

32:19.190 --> 32:23.089
AND YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO ME

32:23.109 --> 32:24.079
TALK FOR A WHILE NOW, SO NOW I'M

32:24.099 --> 32:25.000
GOING TO GIVE HER THE LAST WORD

32:25.019 --> 32:25.170
TONIGHT:

32:25.190 --> 32:26.250
>> SO, WHEN THEY SAY, "WHY DO

32:26.269 --> 32:27.170
YOU BURN DOWN THE COMMUNITY?

32:27.190 --> 32:28.200
WHY DO YOU BURN DOWN YOUR OWN

32:28.220 --> 32:29.119
NEIGHBORHOOD?"

32:29.140 --> 32:32.130
IT'S NOT OURS!

32:32.150 --> 32:34.269
WE DON'T OWN ANYTHING!

32:34.289 --> 32:37.009
WE DON'T OWN ANYTHING.

32:37.029 --> 32:39.009
THERE IS -- TREVOR NOAH SAID IT

32:39.029 --> 32:39.259
SO BEAUTIFULLY LAST NIGHT --

32:39.279 --> 32:41.230
THERE'S A SOCIAL CONTRACT THAT

32:41.250 --> 32:44.059
WE ALL HAVE, THAT IF YOU STEAL

32:44.079 --> 32:46.150
OR IF I STEAL, THEN THE PERSON

32:46.170 --> 32:47.150
WHO IS THE AUTHORITY COMES IN

32:47.170 --> 32:48.279
AND THEY FIX THE SITUATION.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.170
BUT THE PERSON WHO FIXES THE

32:50.190 --> 32:52.089
SITUATION IS KILLING US.

32:52.109 --> 32:53.200
SO THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IS

32:53.220 --> 32:55.240
BROKEN.

32:55.259 --> 32:57.220
AND IF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IS

32:57.240 --> 32:59.160
BROKEN, WHY THE FUCK DO I GIVE

32:59.180 --> 33:01.180
A SHIT ABOUT BURNING THE FUCKING

33:01.200 --> 33:02.190
FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME, ABOUT

33:02.210 --> 33:04.059
BURNING A FUCKING TARGET?

33:04.079 --> 33:05.279
YOU BROKE THE CONTRACT WHEN YOU

33:06.000 --> 33:07.059
KILLED US IN THE STREETS AND

33:07.079 --> 33:08.190
DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK!

33:08.210 --> 33:10.220
YOU BROKE THE CONTRACT

33:10.240 --> 33:12.009
FOR 400 YEARS.

33:12.029 --> 33:12.190
WE PLAYED YOUR GAME AND BUILT

33:12.210 --> 33:14.019
YOUR WEALTH.

33:14.039 --> 33:15.160
YOU BROKE THE CONTRACT WHEN WE

33:15.180 --> 33:17.200
BUILT OUR WEALTH, AGAIN, ON OUR

33:17.220 --> 33:20.039
OWN BY OUR BOOTSTRAPS IN TULSA

33:20.059 --> 33:23.009
AND YOU DROPPED BOMBS ON US.

33:23.029 --> 33:23.279
WHEN WE BUILT IT IN ROSEWOOD AND

33:24.000 --> 33:25.019
YOU CAME IN AND YOU SLAUGHTERED

33:25.039 --> 33:27.130
US.

33:27.150 --> 33:29.039
YOU BROKE THE CONTRACT,

33:29.059 --> 33:30.269
SO FUCK YOUR TARGET.

33:30.289 --> 33:34.269
FUCK YOUR HALL OF FAME.

33:34.289 --> 33:35.230
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

33:35.250 --> 33:37.279
THEY CAN BURN THIS BITCH

33:38.000 --> 33:39.200
TO THE GROUND AND IT STILL

33:39.220 --> 33:41.109
WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH.

33:41.130 --> 33:42.180
AND THEY ARE LUCKY THAT WHAT

33:42.200 --> 33:44.039
BLACK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS

33:44.059 --> 33:46.119
EQUALITY AND NOT REVENGE.

33:46.140 --> 33:50.180
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.029
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

33:51.049 --> 33:53.250
GOOD NIGHT.
