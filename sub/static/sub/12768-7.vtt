♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.625 --> 00:09.583
(Addison) YOU KNOW
WHAT GETS ON MY NERVES?

00:09.625 --> 00:13.041
(Sam) HMM?
THIS ASSERTION THAT WE ARE
SUPPOSED TO PAIR UP,

00:13.083 --> 00:15.542
YOU KNOW, THAT WE
HAVE TO BE IN COUPLES.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.041
AND LOVE, MARRIAGE--YOU KNOW,
MARRIAGE WAS INVENTED

00:18.083 --> 00:20.041
AS A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION,

00:20.083 --> 00:22.041
AND IT DOES NOT
MAKE YOU WHOLE.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.417
YEAH, AND A LOT OF MARRIAGES
END IN DIVORCE.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.750
YES, MOST MARRIAGES
END IN DIVORCE.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.750
I'M DIVORCED.
YOU'RE DIVORCED.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.375
MARRIAGE IS STUPID.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.750
MY LIFE IS MINE.
RIGHT?

00:32.792 --> 00:34.750
IT'S A GOOD LIFE.
RIGHT.

00:34.792 --> 00:37.041
LAST NIGHT
I STAYED HOME WITH MY CAT.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.583
WE ORDERED SUSHI

00:38.625 --> 00:41.041
AND LEARNED ABOUT THE KOMBAI
TRIBES OF NEW GUINEA.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.583
MM. GOOD TIMES.

00:42.625 --> 00:46.000
OH, I NEED SEX, SAM,
LIKE I NEED WATER.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.375
I'M IN A DESERT.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.375
AND IT'S NOT ACTUALLY
THE SEX THAT I MISS,

00:49.417 --> 00:51.375
WHICH I WOULD BE
VERY GRATEFUL FOR,

00:51.417 --> 00:53.166
LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

00:53.208 --> 00:56.166
IT'S JUST THAT FEELING,
YOU KNOW, OF BEING ALIVE.

00:56.208 --> 00:59.166
I MEAN, THE FLUTTER
THAT YOU GET IN YOUR STOMACH

00:59.208 --> 01:02.166
WHEN YOU FIRST KISS SOMEONE
AND--AND YOUR LIPS PART

01:02.208 --> 01:04.041
YOUR TONGUES--
UGH! STOP!

01:04.083 --> 01:06.667
JUST STOP.

01:06.709 --> 01:08.709
(exhales)
OH, I GOTTA SIT.

01:11.083 --> 01:13.041
AHH.

01:13.083 --> 01:16.792
OKAY, I NEED IT, TOO, BUT IF
YOU TELL ANYBODY, I S--

01:16.834 --> 01:19.000
I WON'T.

01:24.291 --> 01:27.709
WHAT IF YOU HAD SAID YES?

01:27.750 --> 01:30.834
YES TO WHAT?
IN MED SCHOOL
WHEN I ASKED YOU OUT

01:30.875 --> 01:32.208
AND--RIGHT.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.959
(chuckles) SAM.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.417
WHAT IF YOU HAD SAID YES?
WELL, I MEAN, I COULDN'T.
I MEAN, NAI WAS--

01:37.458 --> 01:39.083
IS--WAS MY BEST FRIEND,

01:39.125 --> 01:42.083
AND SHE HAD
A HUGE CRUSH ON YOU.
I KNOW,
AND SO I ASKED HER OUT

01:42.125 --> 01:45.083
AND THEN WE GOT MARRIED,
AND THEN WE GOT DIVORCED.

01:45.125 --> 01:48.625
DEREK ASKED YOU OUT. YOU GOT
MARRIED AND YOU GOT DIVORCED.

01:48.667 --> 01:52.208
SO I'M ASKING YOU NOW...
WHAT IF YOU HAD SAID YES?

01:52.250 --> 01:56.208
DO YOU THINK THAT
WE WOULD'VE HAD A SHOT

01:56.250 --> 01:59.917
AT--AT MAKING IT?

01:59.959 --> 02:01.333
ME AND YOU?

02:01.375 --> 02:03.250
ME AND YOU.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.041
(man) HELP ME!

02:05.083 --> 02:07.125
HELP ME!

02:07.166 --> 02:09.041
OVER HERE.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.041
(strained breathing)

02:11.083 --> 02:13.083
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:13.125 --> 02:16.041
MY WIFE...
ALL RIGHT, PULSE
AND RESPIRATORY RATE ARE RAPID.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.500
(grunts)

02:17.542 --> 02:20.750
I HAVE NO SIGNAL
THIS DEEP IN THE CANYON.
OKAY.

02:20.792 --> 02:24.041
USE MINE. ALL RIGHT,
TENDER ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

02:24.083 --> 02:26.250
HE'S LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD.
MY WIFE...

02:26.291 --> 02:30.500
WE'RE GONNA CALL HER
JUST AS SOON AS WE CAN, SIR.
NO. OUR CAR CRASHED.

02:30.542 --> 02:33.542
(breathing raspily)
I TRIED TO GET--GET HELP.

02:33.583 --> 02:36.625
KARA, SHE--
SHE'S OVER THERE.

02:36.667 --> 02:39.041
HELP MY--HELP MY WIFE.

02:39.083 --> 02:41.000
(coughs and groans)

03:04.875 --> 03:07.375
OH, THANK GOD YOU CAME.

03:07.417 --> 03:10.041
KARA, MY NAME'S ADDISON.
I'M A DOCTOR.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.667
WHERE DOES IT HURT?
EVERYWHERE.

03:11.709 --> 03:13.834
AND--AND WE'RE STUCK.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.417
CAN YOU--COULD YOU
GET US OUT?

03:16.458 --> 03:19.417
WHERE'S--WHERE'S JAKE? DID THEY
GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL?

03:19.458 --> 03:21.417
JAKE'S WITH MY FRIEND SAM.
HE'S A DOCTOR.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.625
UH, LET'S TRY TO GET YOU
OUT OF THIS CAR, OKAY?
I CAN'T. MY A--

03:24.667 --> 03:27.041
ARM IS STUCK.

03:27.083 --> 03:30.458
(whimpering)

03:30.500 --> 03:33.041
OKAY. C-CAN YOU--
CAN YOU FEEL YOUR FINGERS?

03:33.083 --> 03:36.041
I COULD--I COULD YES-YESTERDAY.
NOW THEY'RE--THEY'RE TINGLY.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.875
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE BABY.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.875
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE YESTERDAY?

03:39.917 --> 03:43.041
YEAH, IT WAS GETTING DARK
WHEN WE CRASHED,

03:43.083 --> 03:44.875
AND JAKE LEFT BEFORE SUNSET.

03:44.917 --> 03:47.041
WHEN HE DIDN'T COME BACK,
I WAS AFRAID.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.041
THANK GOD HE MADE IT OUT.

03:49.083 --> 03:53.041
WE FOUND HIM ABOUT
50 FEET UP ON THE HILL.

03:53.083 --> 03:56.250
HE WAS OUT THERE...
ALL NIGHT?

03:56.291 --> 03:59.834
BUT... I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE
TO GET ME OUT.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.250
IT'S JUST YOU AND--
IT'S JUST YOU AND YOUR FRIEND?

04:02.291 --> 04:05.792
OKAY, KARA--
(crying) YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T GET ME OUT.

04:05.834 --> 04:09.041
KARA, LISTEN TO ME. JAKE IS
ALIVE. SAM IS HELPING HIM.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.834
BUT I NEED
TO CHECK THE BABY. OKAY?
OKAY.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.875
NOW WHEN'S YOUR DUE DATE?

04:14.917 --> 04:18.709
UM...
(voice breaks) TODAY.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.667
I'M DUE TODAY.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.291
(sobs)

04:30.125 --> 04:31.709
(elevator bell dings)

04:31.750 --> 04:33.041
(laughter)

04:33.083 --> 04:35.917
OH, UH, YEAH. HEY, GUYS.
WE CLOSE EARLY ON SATURDAYS.

04:35.959 --> 04:37.917
BRENDON GOT MARRIED
TODAY, DUDE.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.750
MAZEL TOV, BRENDON.
(men) MAZEL TOV!

04:40.792 --> 04:42.750
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T DRINK
IN HERE, YOU GUYS.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.917
YOU, UH... HEY, YOUR
WEDDING DAY'S A BIG DAY.

04:44.959 --> 04:48.041
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE
SO DRUNK THAT YOU FORGET IT.

04:48.083 --> 04:51.125
I'M NOT DRUNK.
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.959
IT'S MY WEDDING NIGHT,
AND MELISSA AND I,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.041
TONIGHT WILL BE
THE... FIRST TIME.
OKAY.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE VIRGINS?

04:57.083 --> 04:59.917
WE FIGURED IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO MAKE THE FIRST TIME,

04:59.959 --> 05:01.917
YOU KNOW, SPECIAL.
THAT'S SWEET.

05:01.959 --> 05:05.041
UH... I'M SORRY.
DID YOU NEED SOMETHING?

05:05.083 --> 05:07.041
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO TAKE A CHANCE,

05:07.083 --> 05:10.083
SO I TOOK THESE PILLS
RIGHT AFTER WE SAID "I DO."

05:10.125 --> 05:12.709
I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD
KICK IN BY TONIGHT,

05:12.750 --> 05:14.709
AND THEY DID.

05:14.750 --> 05:19.083
BUT IT'S--IT'S BEEN UP
FOR, LIKE, THREE HOURS.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.500
AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
TRIED TO HUG ME--
OH. OH.

05:21.542 --> 05:24.333
(laughing)
OKAY, OKAY.
HOW MANY DID YOU TAKE?

05:24.375 --> 05:27.375
FOUR, MAYBE FIVE.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.583
MM-HMM.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.041
THIS IS THE SEXOLOGY PLACE,
RIGHT?

05:31.083 --> 05:33.041
SHE'S DEHYDRATED. I'M AFRAID
OF VASCULAR COLLAPSE.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.542
THE BABY'S OKAY?
SHE SAYS
SHE CAN FEEL MOVEMENT,

05:35.583 --> 05:38.041
BUT I CAN'T ANGLE IN
TO HEAR THE FETAL HEARTBEAT.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.041
I MEAN, THERE COULD BE
A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION.

05:40.083 --> 05:43.000
I-I-I DON'T KNOW.
HOW'S HE DOING?
BROKEN RIB, HE'S GOT
A DEEP GASH TO HIS THIGH,

05:43.041 --> 05:45.959
BLEEDING INTERNALLY--HE'S BAD.
I GOTTA GET HELP FAST.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.959
YOU THINK YOU CAN
GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE DARK?
IF I RUN, MAYBE.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.166
I MEAN, IT TOOK US
THREE HOURS TO GET IN.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL JUST GO
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 'EM,

05:53.208 --> 05:56.208
TRY TO KEEP THEM BOTH STABLE
UNTIL YOU COME BACK WITH HELP.

05:56.250 --> 05:59.041
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT
A PRESSURE DRESSING ON HIM

05:59.083 --> 06:02.875
SO HE DOESN'T BLEED OUT,
THEN I'LL GO.
OKAY. GO FAST, SAM.

06:04.667 --> 06:08.125
WHOO.
HELLO.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.125
WHICH ONE OF YOU
HAS THE ERECTION?

06:11.166 --> 06:14.041
PRIAPISM'S NO JOKE, FELLAS.
IF I DON'T GET THAT MAST DOWN,

06:14.083 --> 06:17.208
THIS BOAT MIGHT NEVER
SAIL AGAIN.
WELL, YOU WANNA WALK
MY PLANK, CAPTAIN?

06:17.250 --> 06:19.041
HEY.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.417
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

06:20.458 --> 06:21.834
DAN.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.834
WELL, DAN, LET ME TELL YOU

06:23.875 --> 06:26.041
THE PROCEDURE
FOR REVERSING PRIAPISM.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.041
FIRST I TAKE
A LONG-GAUGE NEEDLE,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.667
AND I PUSH IT DOWN
THE HEAD OF THE PENIS,

06:30.709 --> 06:33.667
THEN I SLOWLY DRAW OUT BLOOD,
FLUSH IT WITH SALINE AND REPEAT.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.500
STILL THE MAN, DAN?
NOW WHO HAS THE ERECTION?

06:38.083 --> 06:40.417
NICE TO MEET YOU.
FOLLOW ME.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.250
AAH! OH, GOD.
OKAY. SORRY. SORRY, MAN.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.667
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
(grunts)

06:47.709 --> 06:51.041
AS LONG AS YOU'RE TAKING CARE
OF KARA, IT'S OKAY.
WELL, YOU BOTH SURVIVED
A REALLY HORRIBLE CRASH.

06:51.083 --> 06:54.041
THE BABY SEEMS OKAY.
(breathing raspily) I THOUGHT
I COULD MAKE IT OUT.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.792
I THOUGHT I COULD DO IT,
YOU KNOW?

06:56.834 --> 07:00.375
ALL RIGHT. ADDISON WILL BE BACK
TO CHECK UP ON YOU.
(gasping)

07:00.417 --> 07:02.208
WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG?

07:02.250 --> 07:05.041
I-I CAN'T BREATHE.
(gasping)

07:05.083 --> 07:08.667
DAMN IT. YOU'VE GOT
A COLLAPSED LUNG.
(chokes)

07:08.709 --> 07:10.542
OKAY, UM...
(gasping continues)

07:10.583 --> 07:13.500
OKAY, I'M...
(gasping continues)

07:13.542 --> 07:16.125
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE AN INCISION IN YOUR CHEST

07:16.166 --> 07:18.542
TO RELIEVE
SOME OF THIS PRESSURE.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.041
THIS IS GONNA HURT.
HERE WE GO.
AAH!

07:21.083 --> 07:24.041
(coughing)

07:24.083 --> 07:28.041
(groaning)

07:28.083 --> 07:30.875
(gasping)

07:30.917 --> 07:34.041
OKAY. STAY WITH ME, JAKE.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.041
STAY WITH ME JAKE.
(gasps)

07:36.083 --> 07:37.000
(gasps)
JAKE!

07:40.625 --> 07:42.667
YOU NEED TO DROP 'EM,
BRENDON.
I CAN'T.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.667
WE'RE DEALING WITH
A TICKING CLOCK HERE.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.959
THE LONGER YOU WAIT,
THE GREATER THE CHANCE

07:47.000 --> 07:49.458
OF PERMANENT VASCULAR
AND NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.250
DO YOU WANT YOUR JOHNSON
TO FALL OFF?

07:52.291 --> 07:55.291
NO.
WELL, HE'S A VIRGIN,
AND IT'S HIS WEDDING NIGHT.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.041
WHAT'S THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?
I THINK STANDING IN FRONT OF
MARIA SHARAPOVA

07:58.083 --> 08:00.083
WITH A PITCHED TENT

08:00.125 --> 08:03.250
IS A LITTLE LIKE
CHEATING ON HIS BRIDE.
THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

08:03.291 --> 08:06.250
I'M A PHYSICIAN, AND WE HAVE
A TENNIS COURT RESERVED.
OKAY, WHAT IF--
WHAT IF I CAME IN,

08:06.291 --> 08:08.959
IF I WAS THERE,
SORT OF LIKE A CHAPERONE?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.834
FOR HIS PENIS?

08:10.875 --> 08:14.041
FINE.
JUST GET HIS PANTS OFF.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.041
(clears throat)
UH, CHARLOTTE...

08:16.083 --> 08:20.041
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO,
UH, CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.500
DOES THAT HURT?

08:21.542 --> 08:24.041
MM. NO.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.709
(groans)
THIS IS MY FAULT...

08:26.750 --> 08:28.709
THE CRASH.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.709
A BEE FLEW IN THE CAR,
AND I GRABBED JAKE'S ARM.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.041
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:34.083 --> 08:36.125
AH! THAT HURTS.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.709
THAT'S YOUR RIB.
IT'S PROBABLY BROKEN.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.750
THAT OUGHT TO MAKE DELIVERY
REALLY FUN, HUH?

08:40.792 --> 08:44.125
MM. WELL, MY VOTE
IS FOR A C-SECTION

08:44.166 --> 08:45.959
IN A HOSPITAL.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.041
I SECOND THAT VOTE.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.041
JAKE WANTED A HOME BIRTH.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.041
I TOLD HIM THAT'S FINE

08:52.083 --> 08:55.125
AS LONG AS THE BABY
COME OUTTA HIM. (chuckles)
OOH.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.667
(Sam) ADDISON!

08:56.709 --> 08:58.041
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

08:58.083 --> 09:00.458
(grunts) ALMOST.
COLLAPSED LUNG.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.000
EASY.
OH!

09:02.041 --> 09:04.792
THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.
I HAD TO IMPROVISE A CHEST TUBE.

09:04.834 --> 09:07.792
HE'S STABLE, BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP
OPENING THE TUBE

09:07.834 --> 09:10.333
EVERY HALF AN HOUR...
(lowered voice) OR HE'LL ARREST.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.333
(normal voice)
I BROUGHT HIM HERE

09:12.375 --> 09:16.041
SO YOU COULD WATCH BOTH OF 'EM.
WHAT'S HAPPENING? JAKE!

09:16.083 --> 09:19.709
(Kara) JAKE!
(breathing raspily) TELL HER...
TELL HER I'M OKAY, PLEASE.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.041
HE'S OKAY, KARA.
OH.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.083
SAM, IT'S GONNA BE DARK SOON.
I-I KNOW, I KNOW.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.041
WE HAD A HARD ENOUGH TIME
FINDING THE TRAIL

09:26.083 --> 09:28.875
DURING THE DAYLIGHT.
YEAH, WELL, THE CAR
CAME FROM SOMEWHERE.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.875
I'M--I'M GONNA TRY TO FIND
THE ROAD. I'LL BE FINE.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.458
ALL RIGHT.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.792
(Jake breathing raspily)

09:37.834 --> 09:39.375
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:39.417 --> 09:42.041
NOTHING. IT'S JUST,
UH, JAKE'S HAVING--
AAH!

09:42.083 --> 09:43.917
AAH!

09:43.959 --> 09:46.417
HIT THE BRAKES!

09:46.458 --> 09:49.750
(Kara and Addison screaming)

09:53.083 --> 09:54.917
(Addison) SAM!

09:54.959 --> 09:56.542
(metal crunches)

09:56.583 --> 09:59.875
DID HE DROP HIS DRAWERS?
GOWNED AND WAITING.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.250
THANK YOU.

10:01.291 --> 10:04.709
OH! YOU SCARED ME.
YOU SCARED ME.

10:04.750 --> 10:07.500
I THOUGHT EVERYBODY HAD LEFT.
CHARLOTTE AND I HAD
A LATE WALK-IN.

10:07.542 --> 10:10.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I HAD SOME WORK TO DO.

10:10.083 --> 10:13.041
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
A LOT HAPPENING AT HOME.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.041
TRUE.
(woman)
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.125
(man) IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.
DON'T LIE TO ME.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.125
HAVE A BEER.
I DON'T WANT A BEER.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.542
OKAY, EVERYBODY JUST CALM DOWN.
NO, NO. DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.333
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE,

10:26.375 --> 10:28.333
AND THEY'VE RUINED IT.
MY WEDDING RECEPTION

10:28.375 --> 10:30.959
IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW,
AND THERE IS NO GROOM!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.041
YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM
VERY UPSET RIGHT NOW.

10:33.083 --> 10:36.041
MAYBE WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE
AND HAVE A TALK?
(crying) IS IT TRUE
ABOUT... HIS THING?

10:36.083 --> 10:39.000
(men laugh)
IT'S NOT FUNNY!
IT'S MY WEDDING NIGHT.

10:39.041 --> 10:42.500
COME ON. I'LL--I'LL
TAKE YOU TO YOUR HUSBAND.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.041
ADDISON!

10:44.083 --> 10:47.041
(grunting)

10:50.834 --> 10:52.041
ADDISON!

10:52.083 --> 10:53.500
(coughs) I'M OKAY. KARA?

10:53.542 --> 10:55.625
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M STILL HERE.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.083
ARE YOU OKAY?
YES.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.959
IS SHE OKAY?
YEAH.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.500
OKAY, OKAY. UM...
YOU'RE--YOU'RE BLEEDING.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.041
WHAT?
(grunts)

11:03.083 --> 11:05.041
OH, I HIT MY HEAD.
ALL RIGHT.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.709
IT'S NOTHING. I'M OKAY.
LET ME
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.166
I CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR.
WHAT?

11:11.208 --> 11:14.083
I CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR.
HERE, SAM. HELP ME.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.291
THE ROCK IS BLOCKING
THE DOOR.
HELP ME!

11:17.333 --> 11:19.291
(grunts)

11:19.333 --> 11:21.834
OKAY. OKAY.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.834
LOOK, CAN YOU GET OUT
THAT WINDOW?

11:23.875 --> 11:25.542
NO.

11:27.083 --> 11:30.000
SAM.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.750
(lowered voice)
IF YOU CAN'T GET OUT,

11:35.792 --> 11:38.041
I CAN'T LEAVE.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.333
JAKE--HIS TUBING--
IT'LL CLOG...

11:40.375 --> 11:43.125
(whispers)
AND HE WILL DIE.
WHAT?

11:43.166 --> 11:45.875
(normal voice) OKAY.
WHAT IS IT?

11:45.917 --> 11:47.875
NOTHING. ALL RIGHT?
THE, UH... KARA...

11:47.917 --> 11:49.875
TRYING TO
FIGURE THIS OUT.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.875
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO, UH,

11:51.917 --> 11:53.875
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO
STAY HERE THROUGH--

11:53.917 --> 11:55.959
WAIT OUT THE NIGHT.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.583
WHAT? (cries)

12:04.667 --> 12:06.792
BOURBON, NEAT.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.792
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

12:08.834 --> 12:10.792
THANKS,
BUT I'VE GOT ONE COMING.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.166
SORRY
THAT TOOK SO LONG.

12:12.208 --> 12:14.792
THAT BARTENDER
WAS A TOTAL...

12:14.834 --> 12:17.041
PETE. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

12:17.083 --> 12:19.792
HAVING A DRINK.
NO, I CAN SEE THAT.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:19.834 --> 12:23.000
JUST LIKE YOU,
TRYING TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN.
MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.583
N-NO, NO. WAIT.
THANKS FOR THE DRINK,
SHELLY.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.583
♪♪♪

12:27.625 --> 12:29.792
SHELLY?
SHE CAME UP WITH THAT
ON HER OWN.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.875
HOPE I DIDN'T RUIN
YOUR GAME.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.917
(laughs) DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I WASN'T THAT INTERESTED.

12:34.959 --> 12:37.667
SO YOU TRYING OUT
THE SINGLE LIFE?
I AM SINGLE.

12:37.709 --> 12:40.458
RIGHT. RIGHT. OF COURSE.
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.208
NOTHING. NOTHING.
YOU AND VIOLET--

12:42.250 --> 12:44.208
OH, OKAY, STOP.
I AM NOT GOING THERE.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.625
TONIGHT IS ABOUT GOOD BOOZE
AND SINGLE WOMEN, PERIOD.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.625
ON THE PROWL, ARE YOU?
YOU KNOW...

12:48.667 --> 12:51.625
TRYING TO PROVE A POINT?
SHELDON,
IT'S A BIG BAR. I--

12:51.667 --> 12:54.250
OKAY, BUT LOOK,
WE'RE COLLEAGUES NOW.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.250
ASIDE FROM THAT THING
THAT ONCE CAME BETWEEN US,

12:57.291 --> 12:59.250
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

12:59.291 --> 13:01.333
MAYBE WE WOULD'VE BEEN
FRIENDS

13:01.375 --> 13:04.250
IF NOT FOR THAT THING
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.458
I DOUBT IT.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.875
YOU STUCK A NEEDLE
IN HIS--
IT'S OKAY, BABY.
IT DIDN'T HURT.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.291
SHE FROZE IT FIRST.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.792
AND SO OUR NEXT OPTION
IS TO INSERT A SHUNT

13:13.834 --> 13:16.166
TO REDIRECT THE BLOOD FLOW.
A SHUNT?

13:16.208 --> 13:17.792
THAT SOUNDS BIG.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.792
IT IS,
BUT IT'S WHAT I GOT.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.709
OTHERWISE I'LL HAVE TO
DEGLOVE THE PENIS.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.667
DEGLOVE?
I MAKE A CIRCULAR INCISION
AROUND THE GLANDS,

13:25.709 --> 13:28.041
ROLL BACK THE SKIN
AND SQUEEZE OUT THE BLOOD.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.166
OH, GOD!

13:38.834 --> 13:41.834
(vomiting)

13:46.083 --> 13:48.583
(toilet flushes)

13:58.417 --> 14:00.458
FEELING BETTER?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.750
YEAH, A LITTLE.

14:02.792 --> 14:06.041
SO... HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN PREGNANT?

14:11.959 --> 14:14.208
THIS WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.250
WHEN WE MADE
OUR VIRGINITY PLEDGE,

14:16.291 --> 14:18.333
EVERYONE MADE FUN OF US,

14:18.375 --> 14:21.041
SAID WE WERE FREAKS.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.000
BUT WE LIKED BEING DIFFERENT.

14:23.041 --> 14:26.000
IT WAS OUR WAY OF SAYING WHAT
WE HAD TOGETHER WAS SPECIAL.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.041
WELL, THE FACT THAT YOU
COULDN'T KEEP YOUR PROMISE

14:28.083 --> 14:30.667
IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T GET IT.

14:30.709 --> 14:33.667
WE--WE MADE A PLEDGE.
IT'S A BIG COMMITMENT.
ONE THAT'S DIFFICULT TO KEEP.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.333
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT JENNY SAID
AT MY BACHELORETTE PARTY.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.959
WHO--WHO'S JENNY?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.750
MY SISTER.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.959
SHE AND HER FRIENDS
WERE TELLING STORIES

14:42.000 --> 14:44.333
ABOUT THEIR FIRST TIME,
HOW MUCH IT HURT.

14:44.375 --> 14:49.375
THEY SAID I SHOULD JUST DO IT,
JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

14:49.417 --> 14:52.500
THAT WAY, IT WOULD BE GREAT
WHEN I WAS WITH BRENDON.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.417
IT'S NOT BRENDON'S?

14:54.458 --> 14:57.083
I THOUGHT IF THE WEDDING NIGHT
WERE CLOSE ENOUGH,

14:57.125 --> 15:00.041
BRENDON WOULD THINK IT WAS.
IS THAT THE KIND
OF MARRIAGE YOU WANT,

15:00.083 --> 15:01.917
A RELATIONSHIP BASED ON A LIE?

15:01.959 --> 15:04.625
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TELL HIM.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.041
OKAY, UH,
I'M GONNA GO GET JAKE.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
THAT WAY I CAN HELP YOU
AND HIM.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.208
WILL HE MAKE IT
THROUGH THE NIGHT?

15:14.250 --> 15:16.709
MM. (exhales)

15:16.750 --> 15:18.834
W--

15:18.875 --> 15:21.125
Y-YES. IF THE--
IF THE TUBE HOLDS, YEAH.

15:21.166 --> 15:24.041
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.333
(groans)

15:27.375 --> 15:29.834
OKAY.
ADDISON... OOH.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.709
IT HURTS.
SOMETHING HURTS.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.125
OH.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.750
I THINK I'M BLEEDING.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.667
(groans)

15:37.709 --> 15:40.041
AH!
IT'S NOT BLOOD.

15:40.083 --> 15:43.041
YOUR WATER BROKE.
YOU'RE IN LABOR.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.875
OH.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.000
OHH.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.291
OH, YOU'VE PLAYED BEFORE.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.291
I LIVED FOR A WHILE
ON AN ARMY POST.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.125
THERE WASN'T MUCH
TO DO AT NIGHT

15:55.166 --> 15:57.875
EXCEPT GO TO THE BAR,
DRINK AND PLAY DARTS.
YOU WERE IN THE ARMY?

15:57.917 --> 16:00.458
NATIONAL GUARD. I WAS CALLED UP
AS A RESERVE DOCTOR

16:00.500 --> 16:02.000
WHEN WE INVADED IRAQ.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.375
SEE ANY ACTION?

16:03.417 --> 16:05.375
STATIONED
AT A VETERAN'S HOSPITAL

16:05.417 --> 16:06.959
IN LANDSTHUL, GERMANY.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.959
I SAW SOME ACTION IN BOSNIA--
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.959
HAD SOME PRETTY CLOSE CALLS
IN THE FIELD.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.959
I'M SURE BURNING SAGE
IN A WAR ZONE'S

16:14.000 --> 16:16.959
QUITE DANGEROUS.
OKAY, IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY

16:17.000 --> 16:20.792
ABOUT THE TYPE OF MEDICINE
I PRACTICE?
I THINK I JUST DID.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.250
OH, LOOK. YOU LOSE.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.959
LET'S GO AGAIN.
I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY
ALL NIGHT.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.041
(man)
♪ BABY, JUST LOSE CONTROL ♪

16:28.083 --> 16:30.041
♪ GIRL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT ♪

16:30.083 --> 16:33.417
UH, HEY. YOU'RE WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE ON THIS ONE.
HEY.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.709
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.792
VODKA, NO ICE.
THANK YOU.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.834
(speaking indistinctly)

16:44.542 --> 16:46.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.041
WELL, I'M HOPING
THAT VIOLET GETS MELISSA

16:48.083 --> 16:49.500
TO COME CLEAN WITH BRENDON.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.417
SHE'S PREGNANT
BY SOMEONE ELSE.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.291
AND VIOLET IS INVOLVED WHY?

16:53.333 --> 16:57.041
BECAUSE BRENDON NEEDS TO KNOW.
VIOLET SHOULD MIND
HER OWN BUSINESS.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.959
CHARLOTTE.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.083
IT WAS JUST--

17:02.125 --> 17:04.125
GOOD. THIS IS GOOD.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.500
THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.
THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY GOOD.

17:06.542 --> 17:09.166
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?
TALKING TO A PATIENT.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.333
SHE'S NOT YOUR PATIENT.
EXCUSE ME?

17:11.375 --> 17:13.041
SHE'S MY PATIENT'S WIFE.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.959
HE CAME IN FOR A STUCK PENIS
NOT A RELATIONSHIP-ECTOMY.
CHARLOTTE--

17:16.000 --> 17:18.208
NO ONE ASKED US
TO INSERT OURSELVES

17:18.250 --> 17:20.625
IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE.
MELISSA IS UPSET.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.542
I AM HELPING HER
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT--
NO, YOU ARE DOING NOTHING.

17:23.583 --> 17:26.041
CHARLOTTE--
NO ONE IS SAYING ANYTHING
TO ANYONE.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.000
IT'S MY PATIENT
AND MY PENIS.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.041
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

17:33.083 --> 17:36.417
(chuckles) THAT'S FUNNY.
EVERYTHING'S WRONG.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.083
THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT
SHIFTED THE BABY.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.000
HE'S IN A BREECH POSITION.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.208
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IS HE OKAY?

17:43.250 --> 17:45.208
IT MEANS THAT HIS LEGS
ARE POINTING DOWN.

17:45.250 --> 17:48.583
I-I CAN'T DELIVER HIM IN THIS
POSITION WITHOUT TURNING HIM.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.291
DON'T MOVE. HOLD STILL.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.875
I'M GONNA TRY TO FLIP
THE BABY. IT'S GONNA HURT.

17:53.917 --> 17:55.625
OKAY.

17:55.667 --> 17:58.291
OKAY.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.041
OHH!

18:00.083 --> 18:01.917
OH-OH!

18:01.959 --> 18:03.917
(cries)

18:03.959 --> 18:05.041
AH!

18:05.083 --> 18:07.417
OH!

18:07.458 --> 18:10.041
(cries) STOP.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.417
(inhales sharply)

18:11.458 --> 18:13.041
(cries)

18:13.083 --> 18:15.083
DID IT... DID IT WORK?

18:15.125 --> 18:17.959
I'M SORRY.
ADDISON.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.917
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

18:19.959 --> 18:22.291
(lowered voice) THE BABY...
IT'S A FOOTLING BREECH.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.625
I CAN'T MOVE HIM,
AND HE'S COMING.
HOW LONG?

18:25.667 --> 18:27.417
SOON.

18:27.458 --> 18:30.041
AND EVEN IF I DO MANAGE
TO TURN HIM,

18:30.083 --> 18:33.291
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DELIVER
IN THIS POSITION.
(whispers) WE CAN'T WAIT
TILL SUNRISE.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.000
I KNOW. I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA
LOSE ALL THREE OF THEM.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
(Addison and Kara
inhale deeply)

18:45.041 --> 18:47.375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY TACKLE BOX?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.000
I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU

18:49.041 --> 18:51.000
AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE
WHILE I'M GONE.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.458
(breathing raspily)

18:52.500 --> 18:54.041
THE TUBING'S LOOSE.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.041
IF I CAN SEW IT INTO YOUR SKIN,

18:56.083 --> 18:59.000
IT WON'T
GET PULLED OUT OF PLACE.
WHICH WOULD KILL ME?

18:59.041 --> 19:01.041
I THINK IT'LL GIVE YOU
MORE TIME.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.875
YOU PROMISE ME YOU'LL,
UH, COME BACK, RIGHT,

19:03.917 --> 19:05.583
AND BRING HELP FOR KARA?

19:05.625 --> 19:07.375
(breathes raspily)

19:07.417 --> 19:09.000
I PROMISE.

19:09.041 --> 19:12.000
LET'S GET IT OVER WITH THEN,
SO YOU CAN GO.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.333
(breathes raspily)

19:14.375 --> 19:16.375
OKAY, EVERYONE.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.000
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.625
LET'S GO, MELISSA.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.834
I WANT HER TO STAY.
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.792
OKAY. I'LL BE OUTSIDE
IF YOU NEED ME.
WILL YOU STAY?

19:25.834 --> 19:28.417
PLEASE,
SO I DON'T FREAK OUT.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.417
GREAT. PARTY
IN PROCEDURE ROOM ONE.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.041
I KNOW THIS MIGHT SOUND
A LITTLE FORWARD,

19:35.083 --> 19:37.041
BUT I-I SAW YOU
FROM OVER THERE,

19:37.083 --> 19:40.041
AND--AND I THINK YOU ARE...
STUNNING.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.083
YOU HAVE THIS
UNSTOPPABLE SEX APPEAL.

19:42.125 --> 19:46.000
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE--YOU'RE LIKE
THE NIAGARA FALLS OF SEXY.

19:46.041 --> 19:49.083
WOW. THAT WAS... TERRIBLE.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.041
HORRIFIC.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.625
WELL, UH, I'M SHELDON.
DAWN.

19:52.667 --> 19:55.208
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK, DAWN?
I'D LIKE THAT.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.542
UM, A MARGARITA.
A BEER AND A MARGARITA,
PLEASE?

19:57.583 --> 19:59.750
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, I'LL TAKE
A BOURBON STRAIGHT UP.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.041
THANKS, SHELDON.
OH, YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

20:02.083 --> 20:04.041
WE'RE COLLEAGUES.
DOCTORS, ACTUALLY.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.834
WELL, I'M A DOCTOR.
SHELDON'S A SHRINK.
A PSYCHIATRIST,

20:07.875 --> 20:10.667
WHICH MEANS I HAVE MEDICAL
TRAINING AND EMOTIONAL DEPTH.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.959
I BET YOU'RE VERY EASY
TO TALK TO.
OH, HE IS. IT'S KINDA LIKE
TALKING TO YOUR DAD.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.041
GEE. LOOK WHAT TIME
IT IS, PETE.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.542
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING HOME
TO YOUR BABY?
OH, YOU HAVE A BABY?

20:19.583 --> 20:22.000
YEAH, I'M A SINGLE PARENT.
AND AT HIS AGE...
(laughs)

20:22.041 --> 20:23.709
OH, I-I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.041
NO, SHELDON. I'VE GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.083
SHELDON, PUT YOUR MONEY AWAY.
I GOT IT.

20:28.125 --> 20:31.083
I'M GONNA LET YOU TWO
WORK THIS OUT. EXCUSE ME.
IF YOU INSIST.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.250
GREAT. THANK YOU.

20:34.291 --> 20:38.041
BRINGING UP LUCAS...
LOW BLOW.
YOU DREW FIRST BLOOD.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.667
IF YOU CAN'T STAND
THE HEAT, GET--
SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

20:40.709 --> 20:43.041
THIS ISN'T A GAME TO ME.
I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS GIRL.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.041
I THINK SHE'S NICE AND FUNNY
AND SMART.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.709
AND YOU'D TAKE HER HOME
JUST TO PROVE A POINT.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.166
EXCUSE ME?
WELL, IF I'M ALLOWED
TO USE THE NAME,

20:50.208 --> 20:53.166
I THINK YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE
WITH VIOLET.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK YOU'RE PROJECTING.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.208
YOU'RE THE SHRINK,
BUT I THINK MAYBE IT'S YOU

20:55.250 --> 20:58.208
WHO'S STILL HUNG UP ON HER.
I AM A SHRINK,
AND CLINICALLY SPEAKING,

20:58.250 --> 21:01.458
WE WOULD CALL
WHAT YOU JUST SAID AN EVASION.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.834
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,
YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU LOVE HER.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.208
AND WHEN SHE COMES AROUND,
YOU'LL REGRET THIS.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.208

FOR MORE ♪

21:11.709 --> 21:14.625
THE SHUNT'S ALMOST IN.
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.041
THIS IS OUR WEDDING NIGHT,
AND I'VE RUINED IT FOR YOU.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.875
DON'T SAY THAT.

21:19.917 --> 21:22.875
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.500
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.500
I JUST WANTED YOU TO THINK

21:26.542 --> 21:29.041
THAT I WAS SOME KIND
OF ROCK STAR IN BED.

21:29.083 --> 21:33.041
I WANTED YOU TO THINK
I WAS WORTH WAITING FOR.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.041
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.291
MAYBE NOW IS NOT THE TIME.
NOW IS DEFINITELY
NOT THE TIME.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.250
I'M PREGNANT.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.083
WH--BUT...
WE HAD A PLEDGE.

21:43.125 --> 21:47.041
WE AGREED... WAIT. YOU--
YOU DID IT WITH SOMEONE ELSE?!

21:47.083 --> 21:49.458
I HAVE A SHARP INSTRUMENT
INSIDE YOU. IF YOU EVER WANT

21:49.500 --> 21:52.000
TO USE IT AGAIN,
I SUGGEST YOU STOP SQUIRMING.
HOW COULD YOU?!

21:52.041 --> 21:54.583
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.
THIS MARRIAGE IS OVER.

21:54.625 --> 21:59.000
BRENDON, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THIS BUT--
EVERYONE GET OUT NOW.

21:59.041 --> 22:01.542
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, LET'S GO.

22:04.458 --> 22:09.041
(both breathing rhythmically)

22:11.083 --> 22:13.041
HEY.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.041
SO I, UH...

22:16.083 --> 22:19.750
I SEWED THE TUBE IN.
UH, HE'S EXHAUSTED BUT STABLE.

22:19.792 --> 22:21.417
OKAY.

22:21.458 --> 22:24.041
HOW'S THE LABOR?

22:24.083 --> 22:26.041
IT'S PROGRESSING QUICKLY.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.375
OKAY.

22:29.417 --> 22:32.750
OKAY, DON'T FALL
OR GET HURT

22:32.792 --> 22:38.041
OR DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT
CAUSE YOU TO DIE IN THIS CANYON.

22:38.083 --> 22:41.041
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.875
OKAY. BE CAREFUL.

22:43.917 --> 22:45.583
I WILL BE CAREFUL.

23:05.041 --> 23:07.041
(exhales deeply)

23:07.083 --> 23:08.917
(inhales)

23:08.959 --> 23:09.959
(exhales)

23:12.667 --> 23:14.667
(Kara) AAH!
I FEEL SOMETHING!

23:14.709 --> 23:17.250
OH, MY GOD.
I FEEL SOMETHING.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.458
(Jake) WHAT IS IT?

23:19.500 --> 23:22.458
(Addison) IT'S NOTHING.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.458
TELL ME. JUST TELL ME.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.041
IT'S BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU
NOT SAYING THINGS.

23:27.083 --> 23:30.208
THE BABY'S FOOT--IT'S COME OUT
THROUGH THE CERVIX.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.834
HIS FOOT?

23:31.875 --> 23:34.041
OH, NO. I CAN'T--
I CAN'T DELIVER HIM LIKE THIS.

23:34.083 --> 23:36.041
HE'LL DIE.
HE'S NOT FULLY ENGAGED,

23:36.083 --> 23:39.041
SO I NEED TO PUSH HIM BACK UP
THROUGH THE BIRTH CANAL

23:39.083 --> 23:41.500
AND TRY TO INVERT HIM
FROM THE INSIDE.

23:41.542 --> 23:45.291
WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
IT'S BAD, BUT YOU CAN
DO THIS, KARA, OKAY?

23:45.333 --> 23:47.750
JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

23:47.792 --> 23:50.125
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT HERE
WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT?

23:50.166 --> 23:53.125
AND WE'RE BOTH JUST...
WE'RE BOTH JUST GONNA BREATHE.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.041
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.041
OKAY, READY?
(whimpers) UH-HUH.

23:58.083 --> 24:01.834
(inhales deeply)
AAH! NO, NO!

24:01.875 --> 24:04.125
NO, I CAN'T! I CAN'T!

24:04.166 --> 24:08.250
STOP! STOP! OW! STOP IT!

24:08.291 --> 24:10.750
STOP. (crying)
KARA, KARA,
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

24:10.792 --> 24:13.834
I NEED YOU TO TRY.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.250
YOU CAN DO IT, BABY.
YOU CAN DO IT.

24:16.291 --> 24:20.041
(crying) NO, I CAN'T.
OH, YES, YOU CAN. YOU'RE
THE MOST STUBBORN WOMAN I KNOW.

24:20.083 --> 24:23.041
IT'S NOT TOO HARD FOR YOU.
WE CAN DO THIS.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.041
NO, I DON'T WANT TO.
PLEASE.

24:25.083 --> 24:26.709
KARA, LISTEN TO ME.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.709
YOU KNOW HOW MOST TIMES...
(gasps)

24:28.750 --> 24:31.709
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ALWAYS
IN CHARGE OF US, RIGHT?

24:31.750 --> 24:33.917
(gasps)
YOU DECIDE WHERE WE EAT,

24:33.959 --> 24:35.917
WHAT COLOR
THE BABY'S ROOM'S GONNA BE,

24:35.959 --> 24:38.750
WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO
ON VACATION.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.750
AND IT WORKS
'CAUSE I TRUST YOU

24:40.792 --> 24:43.750
AND I KNOW YOU WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR US.

24:43.792 --> 24:46.500
(gasps)
WELL, NOW IT'S MY TURN.

24:46.542 --> 24:48.500
I'M THE ONE WHO'S IN CHARGE.

24:48.542 --> 24:51.583
I'M IN CHARGE OF US,
AND I SAY YOU CAN DO THIS.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.041
(crying)
SO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.041
(gasps)
IT'S MY TURN, OKAY?

24:56.083 --> 24:59.959
(gasps) I KNOW WHAT'S BEST.
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.041
KARA... YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

25:03.083 --> 25:06.000
(crying)
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

25:06.041 --> 25:08.041
JUST DO IT.
ALL RIGHT?

25:08.083 --> 25:10.959
(crying)
LET'S TRY AGAIN.
OKAY? YOU READY?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.542
UH-HUH.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

25:12.583 --> 25:15.750
OKAY. AAH!

25:15.792 --> 25:18.000
COME ON.
OH, GOD!

25:18.041 --> 25:20.000
COME ON.
A LITTLE BIT MORE. ALMOST.

25:20.041 --> 25:22.041
OW! GOD!

25:22.083 --> 25:23.250
OW!

25:23.291 --> 25:25.041
YES!

25:25.083 --> 25:26.041
OH!

25:26.083 --> 25:29.041
WH-WHAT JUST--WHAT HAPPENED?
DID SHE DO IT?

25:29.083 --> 25:31.583
(whimpers)
WE DID IT!

25:31.625 --> 25:33.583
(cries)

25:33.625 --> 25:35.041
(exhales)

25:35.083 --> 25:36.792
I LOVE YOU, KARA.

25:36.834 --> 25:38.792
(crying)
OH, I LOVE YOU, TOO.

25:38.834 --> 25:42.583
(breathing deeply)

25:45.458 --> 25:48.458
HEY, MELISSA'S IN MY OFFICE
CRYING HER EYES OUT.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.458
SHE SAYS SHE WON'T LEAVE
UNTIL SHE TALKS TO BRENDON.

25:51.500 --> 25:56.041
HE DOESN'T
WANT TO SPEAK TO HER.
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GET HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

25:56.083 --> 25:58.083
I GET IT.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.500
YOU'RE A MEDDLER.
YOU LIKE TO MEDDLE.

26:00.542 --> 26:02.166
MEDDLING MAKES YOU HAPPY.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.291
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO MY PATIENTS,

26:04.333 --> 26:08.041
I'D PREFER YOU STAYED AWAY.
OKAY, WE USE A TEAM APPROACH
HERE, CHARLOTTE.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.417
THAT MEANS WE SHARE ADVICE
OR SUGGESTIONS

26:10.458 --> 26:12.667
OR ANYTHING
THAT MIGHT HELP THE PATIENT.

26:12.709 --> 26:14.667
BRENDON CAME HERE
FOR A CASE OF PRIAPISM.

26:14.709 --> 26:16.709
NOW LOOK WHERE HE'S AT.
YEAH, WELL, LOOK WHERE
THEY'RE BOTH AT.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.709
THEY START THE DAY,
THEIR WHOLE LIVES AHEAD OF THEM,

26:19.750 --> 26:23.250
HAPPINESS WITHIN THEIR REACH,
AND... THEN IT'S SHATTERED.

26:23.291 --> 26:26.542
AND WHO SHATTERED IT, VIOLET?
WHO GOT HER TO OPEN HER YAP?

26:29.250 --> 26:30.834
I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID.

26:30.875 --> 26:33.834
I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID OF
GETTING TO KNOW YOUR PATIENTS.

26:33.875 --> 26:38.041
SO YOU PUT ON
THE TOUGH SOUTHERN GIRL ACT,

26:38.083 --> 26:41.125
BECAUSE TO FEEL
WHAT THEY'RE FEELING...

26:41.166 --> 26:43.291
WELL, THAT WOULD MEAN
FEELING SOMETHING.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.417
IS THIS THE PART WHERE I
BREAK OUT THE KLEENEX

26:46.458 --> 26:49.709
BECAUSE YOU THINK MY HEART'S
DARKER THAN TEXAS COAL?

26:53.375 --> 26:56.750
YOU KNOW, OUR PATIENTS COME HERE
FOR HEALING, CHARLOTTE.

26:56.792 --> 26:59.458
SO... WHETHER THAT MEANS
A PILL

26:59.500 --> 27:02.041
OR A BANDAGE OR A NEEDLE
OR A CONVERSATION,

27:02.083 --> 27:03.667
IT'S THE SAME.

27:03.709 --> 27:07.291
WE LISTEN, AND WHEN WE CAN,
WE RESPOND.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.250
THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE.

27:09.291 --> 27:11.917
NO. IT'S WHAT YOU DO HERE.

27:11.959 --> 27:13.917

STAND THERE ALL NIGHT?

27:21.625 --> 27:23.583
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE

29:15.458 --> 29:17.667
I WAS MARRIED...

29:17.709 --> 29:20.041
ONCE.

29:20.083 --> 29:23.250
I MARRIED THE FIRST MAN
I TRULY LOVED.

FAIRY-TALE THING GOING ON.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.625

HE WAS... AMAZING.

29:32.542 --> 29:36.250
WE WERE AMAZING.

29:36.291 --> 29:39.041
AND THEN HE DID SOMETHING...

SO I LEFT HIM.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.750
I LEFT HIM BEHIND
AND I WENT ON

29:50.792 --> 29:53.917
AND I LIVE
THIS WHOLE OTHER LIFE NOW.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.291

30:04.542 --> 30:06.917
I THINK ABOUT THAT GUY

30:06.959 --> 30:08.917
AND THE FAIRY-TALE THING
WE HAD

30:08.959 --> 30:11.500
AND... I WONDER
IF WE'D STILL BE AMAZING

30:11.542 --> 30:15.083
IF WE WERE TOGETHER NOW.

30:15.125 --> 30:18.041
AND I'LL NEVER KNOW...

30:18.083 --> 30:20.041
'CAUSE THE MINUTE IT GOT HARD,

30:20.083 --> 30:23.125
THE MINUTE IT STOPPED BEING
A FAIRY TALE...

30:23.166 --> 30:24.792
I CUT AND RAN.

30:24.834 --> 30:28.750
REAL LIFE IS HARD.
REAL STUFF TAKES WORK.

30:28.792 --> 30:33.041
REAL LIFE IS SOMETIMES
THOUGHTLESS AND MEAN.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.583
BUT THAT DOESN'T
CANCEL OUT THE LOVE.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.542
SO IF YOU DON'T LOVE
THIS GIRL,

30:38.583 --> 30:41.291
WALK AWAY.

30:41.333 --> 30:43.417
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT HER

30:43.458 --> 30:46.959
AND YOU KNOW SHE'S THE ONE...

30:47.000 --> 30:50.667
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF
TO GIVE HER A SECOND CHANCE.

30:54.208 --> 30:57.792
LIFT YOUR BUTT THEN PUSH.
NO! I CAN'T MOVE.

30:57.834 --> 31:01.458
THE BABY CAN'T COME OUT, KARA,
UNTIL YOU PUSH. NOW LIFT.
YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU CAN DO IT, BABY.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.333
(crying) I CAN'T!

31:03.375 --> 31:05.208
KARA, LOOK AT ME.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.291
KARA, LOOK AT ME.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.375
ALL RIGHT, WE ARE BOTH
TRAPPED IN THIS CAR.

31:09.417 --> 31:11.375
WE ARE BOTH SCARED--
TERRIFIED--ALL RIGHT?

31:11.417 --> 31:15.041
BUT YOU HAVE A GUY OUTSIDE
THIS CAR WHO IS WAITING FOR YOU.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.041
YOU HAVE A GUY WHO LOVES YOU.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.041
NOW IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT I
TELL YOU TO DO, YOU WILL DIE.

31:20.083 --> 31:21.542
YOU WILL DIE ON HIM.

31:21.583 --> 31:23.542
NOW IF I DIE,
NOBODY'S REALLY GONNA CARE.

31:23.583 --> 31:26.041
W--THEY'LL CARE,
BUT THEY WON'T BE BROKEN.

31:26.083 --> 31:29.041
IF YOU DIE, YOU WILL BREAK HIM.
JAKE WILL BE BROKEN.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.041
SOMEONE LOVES YOU.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.417
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND DEBATE THIS.

31:33.458 --> 31:37.041
WHEN I TELL YOU TO PUSH, YOU ARE
DAMN WELL GOING TO PUSH! RIGHT?

31:37.083 --> 31:39.041
SO PUSH!
(screams)

31:39.083 --> 31:41.000
PUSH!

31:41.041 --> 31:43.417
(continues screaming)
GOOD. ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

31:43.458 --> 31:45.834
BABY'S OUT. THE BABY'S OUT.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.041
(chuckles) HOW IS HE?

31:48.083 --> 31:52.041
(whimpers) IS HE OKAY?
IS HE OKAY?

31:52.083 --> 31:55.625
OH... NO. HE CAN'T BE...
YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM.

31:55.667 --> 31:59.083
(crying)
YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.375
(sobs) HELP HIM.

32:01.417 --> 32:03.291
YOU HAVE TO HELP HIM.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.041
(baby cries)

32:05.083 --> 32:07.125
AH!

32:07.166 --> 32:08.750
(laughs)

32:08.792 --> 32:10.750
(laughs)

32:10.792 --> 32:12.083
(sobs)

32:12.125 --> 32:15.041
HE'S OKAY?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

32:15.083 --> 32:17.041
SOMEONE MISSED SOMETHING
ON THE ULTRASOUND,

32:17.083 --> 32:20.083
BECAUSE HE IS A SHE.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.834
AND, YES... (laughs)

32:22.875 --> 32:25.542
SHE'S OKAY. YES.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.041
YES.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.542
HI.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.250
(gasps) SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

32:30.291 --> 32:31.750
(laughs)

32:31.792 --> 32:34.625
AND EVERYTHING'S...
TEN FINGERS, TEN TOES.

32:34.667 --> 32:36.041
(laughs)

32:36.083 --> 32:38.458
JAKE, WE HAD A GIRL.
JAKE, IT'S A GIRL.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.166
(laughs)
HI.

32:41.208 --> 32:45.792
JAKE, YOUR DAUGHTER
IS GORGEOUS!
(gasping)

32:45.834 --> 32:48.000
HUH?

32:49.959 --> 32:51.792
JAKE?

32:51.834 --> 32:54.000
(baby cries)
JAKE!

32:54.041 --> 32:55.875
JAKE!
JAKE!

32:55.917 --> 32:58.083
(crying continues)
I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

32:58.125 --> 32:59.917
JAKE!

32:59.959 --> 33:01.041
JAKE!

33:01.083 --> 33:02.041
(crying continues)

33:04.542 --> 33:07.041
(baby crying)
JAKE! JAKE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

33:07.083 --> 33:09.959
DO YOU SEE HIM?
IS HE MOVING?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.750
(crying continues)

33:12.792 --> 33:14.625
(helicopter blades whirring)

33:14.667 --> 33:17.041
(baby continues crying)

33:17.083 --> 33:18.542
SAM.

33:18.583 --> 33:20.041
SAM!

33:20.083 --> 33:22.041
(helicopter blades whirring)

33:22.083 --> 33:24.041
(man) GET THE REPELLING TEAM!

33:24.083 --> 33:27.041
(man shouts indistinctly)

33:27.083 --> 33:30.000
(blades continue whirring)

33:37.583 --> 33:40.834
SAM! WE HAD THE BABY.
BUT JAKE--HOW'S JAKE?

33:40.875 --> 33:43.792
TELL ME HE'S ALIVE.
TELL ME!

33:43.834 --> 33:46.041
HE'S STILL ALIVE!
OH!

33:46.083 --> 33:47.458
(man) E.M.T.'s ALMOST THERE.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.583
(man) WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
PULL HIM UP IN THE HELICOPTER.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.583
ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME A BACKBOARD,

33:52.625 --> 33:56.041
I.V. OF NORMAL SALINE
AND 0-2 ON A REBREATHER.
(man) YOU GOT IT.

33:56.083 --> 33:59.041
WAY TO HANG IN THERE.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUTTA HERE.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.000
(cries)

34:05.250 --> 34:08.208
(Sam) ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA
BE IN GOOD HANDS, MAN.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.208
WELL DONE.
(man) CAREFUL. CAREFUL.

34:10.250 --> 34:12.583
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT--
I DON'T WANT TO GO, OKAY?

34:12.625 --> 34:14.583
I DON'T WANT TO GO--
SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

34:14.625 --> 34:17.709
I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITHOUT KARA.
SHE'S GONNA CATCH UP WITH YOU
AT THE HOSPITAL.

34:17.750 --> 34:21.041
TAKE CARE OF KARA. PROMISE ME.
YES, I GOT YOU.
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.917
(man) ONE, TWO, THREE.
(grunts and groans)

34:22.959 --> 34:24.208
HEY.

34:24.250 --> 34:26.625
HEY. SAM.
SO THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE YOU GUYS OUTTA HERE

34:26.667 --> 34:28.625
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
HOW IS HE?

34:28.667 --> 34:31.458
HE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD, BUT I
THINK HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
AND THE BABY?

34:31.500 --> 34:34.458
PARAMEDICS HAVE HER ON 0-2.
SHE'S NICE AND PINK.
(Kara and Addison laugh)

34:34.500 --> 34:37.250
YOU GUYS DID GOOD.
ALL RIGHT,
DOOR'S COMING OFF NOW.

34:37.291 --> 34:40.208
(Sam) YEAH.
WE NEED YOU TO STAND CLEAR.

34:40.250 --> 34:44.000
(Kara) THANK YOU.
JUST, UH, THANK YOU.
OH, NO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

34:44.041 --> 34:46.250
I DO. AND I SWEAR,
WHEN WE GET OUTTA HERE,

34:46.291 --> 34:49.875
I AM NAMING THAT BABY ADDISON.
(laughs)

34:49.917 --> 34:52.959
(man) THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
I'M BRINGING 'EM IN.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.333
(man) ALL RIGHT.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.041
(inhales sharply)

34:56.083 --> 34:58.041
(gasps) AAH!

34:58.083 --> 35:00.041
(groans)
STOP! STOP! STOP!

35:00.083 --> 35:02.208
(man) HOLD UP! HOLD UP!

35:02.250 --> 35:04.959
SAM! SHE'S CRASHING.
(man) SHE'S LOSING BLOOD!

35:05.000 --> 35:08.875
THE PRESSURE FROM THE DOOR
MUST HAVE TAMPONADED THE WOUND.
GET ME AN I.V.!

35:08.917 --> 35:11.583
SHE'S CRASHING!
SHE'S CRASHING!

35:18.083 --> 35:20.125
BRENDON, I KNOW
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY.

35:20.166 --> 35:23.041
DAMN RIGHT, I'M ANGRY.
I'M PISSED...

35:23.083 --> 35:25.333
AND HUMILIATED.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.041
(sniffles) I'M SO SORRY.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.583
I NEVER WANTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

35:31.125 --> 35:32.750
BUT?

35:38.083 --> 35:40.083
BUT...

35:40.125 --> 35:44.667
I-I LOOK AT YOU, AND...

35:44.709 --> 35:46.834
I'M NOT READY
TO W-WALK AWAY.

35:48.917 --> 35:50.542
I LOVE YOU.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.917
(cries)

35:51.959 --> 35:53.291
BRENDON.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.291
OH!

35:55.333 --> 35:57.959
KEEP OFF IT
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.458
(elevator bell dings)

36:06.583 --> 36:10.333
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?
GUESS HE DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE UP ON HER.

36:10.375 --> 36:13.166
NOW THAT WAS A LONG NIGHT.
WHO'S UP FOR SOME FOOD?

36:13.208 --> 36:16.834
MY TREAT.
I'LL GO GET MY STUFF.

36:18.542 --> 36:20.500
SO THAT WAS
A GOOD THING YOU DID,

36:20.542 --> 36:23.041
CONVINCING BRENDON
TO GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE.

36:23.083 --> 36:26.375
IS THERE ANY PRIVACY
IN THIS OFFICE?

36:26.417 --> 36:29.125
DOES COOPER KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED?

36:29.166 --> 36:32.417
I WASN'T.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.417
BRENDON AND MELISSA
ARE BACK TOGETHER.

36:34.458 --> 36:37.166
THEY'RE HAPPY. THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS, RIGHT?

36:37.208 --> 36:39.625
W-WHY DON'T I BELIEVE YOU?

36:39.667 --> 36:42.375
LET IT GO, VIOLET.
WERE YOU LYING?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.542
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY MORNING,

36:44.583 --> 36:46.542
BUT I THINK I'M HAVING PANCAKES.

36:46.583 --> 36:49.583
YEAH, I'M HAVING
BANANA PANCAKES.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
O-ON SECOND THOUGHT, I THINK,

36:49.625 --> 36:53.458
UH, I-I GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO FINISH UP, SO...

36:56.083 --> 36:59.458
(men shouting indistinctly)

37:02.375 --> 37:05.208
CHARGE THE PADDLES.

37:05.250 --> 37:08.875
YOU HEARD ME.
CHARGE THE PADDLES.

37:08.917 --> 37:11.041
ADDISON,
IT'S BEEN 20 MINUTES.
NO.

37:14.208 --> 37:16.500
SHE'S GONE.

37:16.542 --> 37:18.166
SHE...

37:18.208 --> 37:22.166
SHE'S GONE.
ADDISON. ADDISON!

37:22.208 --> 37:24.834
SHE'S GONE.

37:36.542 --> 37:40.041

37:40.083 --> 37:43.041

37:43.083 --> 37:45.208

37:45.250 --> 37:47.875

37:47.917 --> 37:50.041
