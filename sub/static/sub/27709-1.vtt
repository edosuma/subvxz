01:29.671 --> 01:33.941
Good evening,
vertebrates and invertebrates.

01:33.943 --> 01:38.445
I'd like to officially welcome
one and all

01:38.447 --> 01:44.383
to tonight's event, the hotly
anticipated Monster Burping Contest.

01:44.385 --> 01:48.254
Now I know many of you
out there, were waiting

01:48.256 --> 01:50.623
with acidic bellies
for this one.

01:50.625 --> 01:54.695
Some of you may even have
designs on competing.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.730
Right, Squatty?
Think it over, buddy.

01:56.732 --> 01:59.865
I've seen you keep that
undertow swirling at the party

01:59.867 --> 02:04.338
and now's your chance
to do it on the grand stage.

02:06.741 --> 02:11.444
But seriously folks, our contest
is open to all comers.

02:11.446 --> 02:14.615
If you've got the desire,
if you've got the talent,

02:14.617 --> 02:18.517
if you're a regular swimming
sub-woofer ,

02:18.519 --> 02:22.622
we want to see you up here,
on this very stage,

02:22.624 --> 02:24.624
showing the ocean
what you've got.

02:24.626 --> 02:28.027
Now's the time.
Our winner will be crowned

02:28.029 --> 02:32.966
the sea's very first
best burping monster.

02:32.968 --> 02:37.371
And without further ado, let me
introduce our contestants.

02:37.373 --> 02:40.674
This school represents some
of the best burping hopefuls

02:40.676 --> 02:45.312
the Sea of Schmerk has to offer,
so far.

02:45.314 --> 02:47.948
Remember,
it's not too late to sign up.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.983
If you've got
the rumble in your belly,

02:49.985 --> 02:52.586
and you can belch
some bubble trouble,

02:52.588 --> 02:54.454
what are you waiting for?

02:54.456 --> 02:56.890
Swim on up here and enter now.

03:00.495 --> 03:04.397
Ho-ho. Alright. First up tonight
is a guy we all know,

03:04.399 --> 03:08.568
the winner of last year's
Speed Fin Flapping Contest,

03:08.570 --> 03:12.475
Charlie Chapfin.

03:27.890 --> 03:32.759
And next up, give a warm sea
welcome to that sticky star

03:32.761 --> 03:34.995
Mucus.

03:47.775 --> 03:51.110
All right, we're expecting
big things from Mucus.

03:51.112 --> 03:53.779
Can't wait to see
how he does in this competition.

03:53.781 --> 03:57.116
Now, you fish in the front row
might want to move back a bit,

03:57.118 --> 03:59.453
and give this next guy
some room.

03:59.455 --> 04:02.122
His reputation precedes him.

04:02.124 --> 04:04.991
Make way for Barf.

04:22.643 --> 04:26.846
Well, there you have him, sea creatures.
Put your fins together.

04:26.848 --> 04:30.016
One of these talented
contestants is going to be

04:30.018 --> 04:33.786
this year's
best burping monster.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.471
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

04:52.473 --> 04:56.175
Yes, excuse you.
This is a private session.

04:56.177 --> 04:58.947
Oh. I'm sorry.
I can come back another time.

04:59.915 --> 05:05.050
Nonsense. You've already
interrupted Squirtlips' exercises.

05:05.052 --> 05:08.622
He'll have to warm up
all over again.

05:08.624 --> 05:10.423
Take a break, Squirt.

05:10.425 --> 05:13.026
But, but, but
I'm feeling it, Maestro.

05:13.028 --> 05:15.661
I, I don't wanna lose momentum.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.531
Oh, chump, you'll learn
to adapt and deal

05:18.533 --> 05:21.935
with circumstances
as they arise, Squirt.

05:21.937 --> 05:25.805
Things will rarely go
exactly as we plan.

05:25.807 --> 05:29.141
So long as we put
the time in the training,

05:29.143 --> 05:31.211
you'll be prepared.

05:31.213 --> 05:33.646
Now, take five while I see

05:33.648 --> 05:37.016
what this young larva
of a sea monster wants.

05:40.521 --> 05:43.723
I really didn't mean
to interrupt, Mr. Maestro.

05:45.126 --> 05:50.030
Ah, just Maestro,
and you have interrupted,

05:50.032 --> 05:53.533
but I'm actually glad you did.

05:53.535 --> 05:55.735
Squirtlips could use a break.

05:55.737 --> 06:00.673
He wants to win the upcoming
burping contest so badly,

06:00.675 --> 06:03.509
he runs a risk of over trying.

06:03.511 --> 06:06.512
Oh, is that a thing?

06:06.514 --> 06:08.682
I'm afraid so.

06:08.684 --> 06:13.987
I've seen many a talented sea
creature undermine their own potential

06:13.989 --> 06:17.591
by pushing themselves so hard

06:17.593 --> 06:22.795
they had nothing left to give
when their time came to shine.

06:22.797 --> 06:27.132
Tell me, Miss, what's your name?

06:27.134 --> 06:28.869
I'm Corallina.

06:28.871 --> 06:32.906
Oh well, hello, Corallina.

06:32.908 --> 06:36.976
What brings you
to my garden today?

06:36.978 --> 06:39.579
I am...

06:39.581 --> 06:42.915
Yes?

06:42.917 --> 06:46.819
I want to participate
in the Monster Burping Contest.

06:46.821 --> 06:49.723
Ah!

06:49.725 --> 06:52.959
I, I expected as much.

06:52.961 --> 06:55.728
You did? How?

06:55.730 --> 07:01.102
I recognize the desire
to compete in your eye.

07:02.103 --> 07:05.507
You do? Oh, no.

07:06.307 --> 07:09.978
Why do you say, oh no, my dear?

07:10.978 --> 07:13.579
Well, it's my father.

07:13.581 --> 07:18.151
I know he wants nothing more than to
have a well-behaved little monster girl

07:18.153 --> 07:20.586
and I love him so much,

07:20.588 --> 07:23.023
but I want to show
the sea what I'm made of.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.158
I want to compete.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.060
And?

07:27.062 --> 07:28.728
And?

07:28.730 --> 07:31.865
You want to compete,
and, and what?

07:31.867 --> 07:34.701
Complete the sentence, my dear.

07:34.703 --> 07:36.735
And win.

07:36.737 --> 07:40.240
There we go.

07:40.242 --> 07:44.610
Have you ever said it
out loud before, Corallina?

07:44.612 --> 07:47.112
No. No, I haven't.

07:47.114 --> 07:50.983
It's been bottled up
inside of you, hasn't it?

07:50.985 --> 07:53.153
Just like your burps,

07:53.155 --> 07:57.891
or fear of disappointing
your father?

07:57.893 --> 07:59.692
Yes.

07:59.694 --> 08:02.728
The power of visualization is

08:02.730 --> 08:06.800
the first step to achieving
your dreams, you know.

08:06.802 --> 08:08.268
It is?

08:08.270 --> 08:14.074
Yes, it is.
Would you like to learn?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.042
Yes, I would.

08:16.044 --> 08:20.146
Alright, then. I never turned
down a willing student.

08:20.148 --> 08:22.781
Well, but let me ask you,

08:22.783 --> 08:26.886
if your father found out
about your training,

08:26.888 --> 08:28.954
how would he react?

08:28.956 --> 08:31.624
I honestly don't know.

08:31.626 --> 08:34.763
But he wouldn't be happy?

08:35.796 --> 08:38.265
No, I don't think he would be.

08:39.232 --> 08:41.668
I see.

08:41.669 --> 08:45.639
I wanna thank you
for your honesty, Corallina.

08:45.641 --> 08:51.213
You must want it terribly bad
to risk defying your family.

08:52.113 --> 08:55.315
I do, Maestro. I want
to compete more than anything

08:55.317 --> 08:58.051
and burp my way to victory.

08:58.053 --> 08:59.753
That's the spirit.

08:59.755 --> 09:02.655
Then, what are we waiting for?

09:02.657 --> 09:04.857
Let's begin.

09:04.859 --> 09:09.699
- Really?
- Really.

09:11.766 --> 09:13.866
I'm ready to continue
my training, Maestro.

09:13.868 --> 09:17.269
Oh, ow. She's still here?

09:17.271 --> 09:20.673
Yes, she is Squirtlips.

09:20.675 --> 09:25.311
Meet your new training partner,
Corallina.

09:25.313 --> 09:27.913
Hmm. Can you burp?

09:39.960 --> 09:43.328
Oh, my, oh.

09:43.330 --> 09:45.465
Was that okay?

09:45.467 --> 09:50.773
Corallina, it would be
an honor to hone your talent.

09:51.906 --> 09:52.807
Really?

09:53.875 --> 09:59.345
You have talent to spare,
but have you got control?

09:59.347 --> 10:01.280
I don't think so.

10:01.282 --> 10:03.416
But with a proper instruction

10:03.418 --> 10:07.256
there's no telling
how far you can go.

10:10.125 --> 10:13.893
Oh, Maestro, thank you.
Thank you so much.

10:13.895 --> 10:15.861
Eh, don't thank me yet.

10:15.863 --> 10:20.066
And please, don't miss class.

10:20.068 --> 10:25.205
It's the cardinal sin
I see in many talented students.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.374
If you wish your skills
to be there for you,

10:28.376 --> 10:32.982
you, you must first
dedicate yourself to them.

10:34.149 --> 10:35.948
I won't
miss class ever, Maestro.

10:35.950 --> 10:38.053
I'll be early always. I promise.

10:38.953 --> 10:40.820
Oh boy.

10:40.822 --> 10:46.326
Excellent. Oh and
one more question, Corallina.

10:46.328 --> 10:51.199
May I ask who is your father?

10:52.166 --> 10:54.803
My father's name is
Foamy Twofins.

10:55.503 --> 10:58.538
Foamy Twofins?

10:58.540 --> 11:01.140
That's him. You know him?

11:01.142 --> 11:04.144
Er, not personally, er, hmm,

11:04.146 --> 11:09.385
but I think I know your mother,
Priscilla Clackerfish.

11:10.385 --> 11:13.153
That's her.

11:13.155 --> 11:17.056
Wow, how do you know
my mom, Maestro?

11:17.058 --> 11:21.394
We trained together
way back when...

11:21.396 --> 11:24.062
Did you know
that your mother was

11:24.064 --> 11:29.536
one of the all-time great
burping monsters of the sea?

11:29.538 --> 11:32.404
I know she competed
once upon a time.

11:32.406 --> 11:35.408
She doesn't talk much
about it really.

11:35.410 --> 11:40.913
Well, she's one
of the very best I've ever seen.

11:40.915 --> 11:44.984
Much less had
the pleasure to work with.

11:44.986 --> 11:48.988
Oh my. I'll never stack up
to that kind of talent.

11:48.990 --> 11:52.225
Ah, you'll never match
Priscilla Clackerfish's talent.

11:53.828 --> 11:56.428
Not so fast, Squirtlips.

11:56.430 --> 12:01.433
There's raw burping potential in
this little one. I'm sure of it.

12:01.435 --> 12:06.876
Corallina, I'd like to start
your training immediately.

12:19.554 --> 12:23.255
Wow, hey there, big thug.

12:23.257 --> 12:26.491
Hey, who, who goes there?

12:26.493 --> 12:29.262
It's just me, your pal Barf.

12:29.264 --> 12:32.599
Barf?
Never heard of no Barf.

12:32.601 --> 12:38.337
Leave my volcano path
before I turn you into sushi.

12:38.339 --> 12:41.039
Now is that any way
to greet an old friend?

12:41.041 --> 12:45.144
We aren't friends, plankton.
Don't know you.

12:45.146 --> 12:49.315
Hey, I know, plankton. Now, you
better watch yourself, right?

12:49.317 --> 12:54.019
Or what? You're gonna pick a
fight with the great Bigsnot?

12:54.021 --> 12:56.389
Oh, foolish seasquirt.

12:56.391 --> 12:58.457
You're dumber than you look.

12:58.459 --> 13:00.894
Oh, really?

13:00.896 --> 13:03.962
I'll give you one chance
to take that back, Bigsnot,

13:03.964 --> 13:06.065
before you come work for me.

13:06.067 --> 13:08.167
Work for you?

13:08.169 --> 13:11.571
You've lost your brain,
coral barnacle.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.206
And you've lost your free will.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.145
What ever do you mean?

13:21.181 --> 13:25.350
Wow. Where am I?
What just happened?

13:25.352 --> 13:28.120
Hey, who, who are you?

13:28.122 --> 13:32.591
I'm Barf,
and in case you are wondering

13:32.593 --> 13:35.561
you've just
fallen victim

13:35.563 --> 13:39.331
to my great
and magical burp power.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.235
Under its control

13:42.237 --> 13:46.405
you'll do as I say
whenever I command.

13:46.407 --> 13:50.610
I'll do as you say
whenever you command.

13:50.612 --> 13:53.479
Excellent.

13:53.481 --> 13:56.249
Now, I'll finish my preparations

13:56.251 --> 13:59.318
to win that Burping
Monster Contest

13:59.320 --> 14:02.221
and with your help, Bigsnot,

14:02.223 --> 14:07.663
no one will dare stop me.

14:12.434 --> 14:16.005
Argh!

14:19.641 --> 14:24.009
Mucus, have you ever been
outside the Sea of Schmerk?

14:24.011 --> 14:27.379
- Why would I leave the sea of Schmerk, Charlie?
- Why not?

14:27.381 --> 14:29.648
Well, everything I need is here.

14:29.650 --> 14:33.619
I got my coral, my riptides,
my sucker fish pies.

14:33.621 --> 14:37.756
- I can go on and on.
- Kind of like the ocean itself, huh?

14:37.758 --> 14:40.326
It just goes on and on.

14:40.328 --> 14:43.462
What's up, Charlie.
Do you need a vacation?

14:43.464 --> 14:46.599
Something like that. A change of
scenery would be nice.

14:46.601 --> 14:49.001
If you say so. Right about now

14:49.003 --> 14:53.038
I think a big bucket of spores
and molds sounds nice.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.606
You would, Mucus.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.542
You know,
I really thought after I won

14:56.544 --> 14:59.012
the Speed Fin Flapping
Contest last year

14:59.014 --> 15:01.246
that things would change for me.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.249
I'd get to travel
and see the great blue sea

15:04.251 --> 15:06.485
from all corners of the globe,

15:06.487 --> 15:09.054
but nothing really changed.

15:09.056 --> 15:11.057
Nothing happened at all.

15:11.059 --> 15:15.461
Oh, that's not true, Char.
You got a cool trophy.

15:15.463 --> 15:18.230
That, I haven't looked at
in a year.

15:18.232 --> 15:20.198
I don't even know
where I put it.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.567
If you don't mind me asking,

15:21.569 --> 15:23.369
why did you enter
this year's contest

15:23.371 --> 15:25.671
if last year's
is still stuck in your gills?

15:25.673 --> 15:28.341
Because I'm doing it for...

15:28.343 --> 15:30.342
Oh, Mucus.

15:30.344 --> 15:33.678
I must confess. I'm in love.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.082
Well, with who?

15:37.084 --> 15:40.419
With Corallina.

15:40.421 --> 15:45.825
Corallina? No way.
When? How? Uhm...

15:45.827 --> 15:49.695
It just happened, Mucus.
I don't know what to say.

15:49.697 --> 15:52.264
We've known each other since
we were little tiny larva

15:52.266 --> 15:56.302
and then one day
she just glowed.

15:56.304 --> 15:59.337
She glowed?
It could be radiation.

15:59.339 --> 16:02.374
It could have been the radioactive
spores from outer space

16:02.376 --> 16:05.745
that rained into the ocean
of Schmerk 10,000 years ago.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.647
- It could have been...
- Mucus.

16:07.649 --> 16:10.817
Quarantine her.
Maybe we should be quarantined.

16:10.819 --> 16:12.085
What if we're sick?

16:12.087 --> 16:13.485
Mucus.

16:13.487 --> 16:16.489
- What?
- We're not sick.

16:16.491 --> 16:18.794
I didn't mean she was
literally glowing. I mean...

16:19.828 --> 16:22.260
She glows to me.

16:22.262 --> 16:25.264
Your eyes might be going bad.

16:25.266 --> 16:27.799
My uncle Richie had
cataracts for three weeks

16:27.801 --> 16:29.368
or it could be surface simmer.

16:29.370 --> 16:31.403
I've seen guppies
in triple effects.

16:31.405 --> 16:33.206
When the light reflects
just right,

16:33.208 --> 16:35.240
I always seek the middle ones.

16:35.242 --> 16:37.176
It works every time.

16:37.178 --> 16:39.544
I appreciate
the suggestions, Mucus,

16:39.546 --> 16:41.346
but my eyes are fine.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.182
It's my heart
that's causing all the trouble.

16:44.184 --> 16:47.220
Your heart?
This could be serious.

16:47.222 --> 16:48.855
Mucus.

16:48.857 --> 16:51.423
We're fish, Charlie.
Simple creatures.

16:51.425 --> 16:54.460
Our hearts only have
one atrium and one ventricle.

16:54.462 --> 16:56.562
There's no room for error.

16:56.564 --> 16:59.698
Okay look, Mucus.
My heart is fine.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.734
I'm still lost.

17:01.736 --> 17:03.369
I know you are.

17:03.371 --> 17:05.872
Listen, I'm just
head over tail wild

17:05.874 --> 17:08.374
as a salmon about Corallina.

17:08.376 --> 17:11.309
I only entered the contest
again this year for her.

17:11.310 --> 17:14.247
But, Charlie, but why?

17:14.249 --> 17:16.481
Corallina is not even competing.

17:16.483 --> 17:19.285
Because I got the crazy idea

17:19.287 --> 17:22.154
that I could impress her
by winning back-to-back titles.

17:22.156 --> 17:26.790
- Well, I mean, that is pretty impressive.
- You think?

17:26.792 --> 17:29.828
Yeah. I mean I'd sure like
to win something for once,

17:29.830 --> 17:32.865
but hey, if you want me
to drop out of the contest

17:32.867 --> 17:35.734
I will, Charlie. I don't wanna
stand in your way or nothing.

17:35.736 --> 17:39.538
Don't sweat it, Mucus. This
year's competition is stiff.

17:39.540 --> 17:42.374
If you think you have a shot
to win it, go for it, buddy.

17:42.376 --> 17:46.244
Really? You're
a heck of a pal, Char.

17:46.246 --> 17:51.884
I know. Besides, I think I'm crazy for
even trying to make Corallina notice me.

17:51.886 --> 17:54.353
I'm just a friend to her.

17:54.355 --> 17:57.355
That's probably
all I'll ever be.

17:58.826 --> 18:01.193
Come on. Let's get
a bucket of spores.

18:09.337 --> 18:11.971
Guys, we have a big problem.

18:11.973 --> 18:14.941
Oh, no. Are we out of spores?

18:14.943 --> 18:16.741
- What?
- What?

18:16.743 --> 18:19.644
It could be ecological,
it's a domino effect.

18:19.646 --> 18:22.582
Once one thing goes, we all go.

18:22.584 --> 18:25.750
It was bound to happen,
we're all doomed.

18:25.752 --> 18:27.886
Mucus, calm down.

18:27.888 --> 18:30.655
Go ahead, Slimybuns,
what's the problem?

18:30.657 --> 18:34.727
It's Barf, he's recruited
Bigsnot as his minion

18:34.729 --> 18:36.528
and they're up to no good.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.998
They're planning bad things.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.269
Barf and Bigsnot? That's the
absolute worst pair I can think of.

18:43.271 --> 18:47.240
How in the ocean did Barf convince
the big monster to join him?

18:47.242 --> 18:50.809
- He burped.
- He what?

18:50.811 --> 18:54.247
Barf exercised the great
and magical burp power.

18:54.249 --> 18:59.018
He let one rip and it took
control of Bigsnot's mind.

18:59.020 --> 19:03.355
The great and magical burp power?
Oh, this is bad. This is real bad.

19:03.357 --> 19:04.923
What do we do, Char?

19:04.925 --> 19:08.027
I don't know, Mucus.
I don't know.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.434
Now that we're
in league together, Bigsnot

19:16.436 --> 19:21.339
the Sea of Schmerk
will feel my wrath.

19:21.341 --> 19:23.909
I may not be the biggest monster
in the ocean...

19:26.513 --> 19:30.383
...but the kraken has
nothing on me.

19:30.385 --> 19:34.787
Oh, preach it, boss.
What will be our first act?

19:34.789 --> 19:38.024
I'm glad you asked, Bigsnot.

19:38.026 --> 19:42.728
As you may know, a fish is
defined by his aspirations.

19:42.730 --> 19:45.564
And I don't dream small.

19:45.566 --> 19:47.599
With your colossal help

19:47.601 --> 19:51.971
we are going to gain access
to the kingdom of Goo.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.472
The kingdom of Goo!

19:54.474 --> 19:56.575
What will we do there?

19:56.577 --> 20:02.080
Well, I will strike a deal
with the kingdom's leader,

20:02.082 --> 20:03.816
the Great Gurglegut.

20:03.818 --> 20:07.886
A deal? What kind of deal?

20:07.888 --> 20:09.989
I'm going to have
the Great Gurglegut

20:09.991 --> 20:13.358
imprison the Maestro
in the kingdom of Goo

20:13.360 --> 20:18.698
and hold him until after that
Burping Monster Contest has ended.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.465
What for?

20:20.467 --> 20:23.736
Oh! Think about it,
you big dumb monster.

20:23.738 --> 20:27.339
The Maestro trains
students all the time.

20:27.341 --> 20:31.042
Once he's out of the way,
his trainees will flounder

20:31.044 --> 20:33.378
and withdraw from competition,

20:33.380 --> 20:37.883
leaving me, Barf, to win
the Burping Monster Contest

20:37.885 --> 20:39.785
without so much as a challenge.

20:43.090 --> 20:46.358
Huh, I like your style, boss.

20:46.360 --> 20:50.695
So do I, Bigsnot, so do I.

20:50.697 --> 20:52.631
Now we must move fast.

20:52.633 --> 20:55.734
The contest is right
around the coral,

20:55.736 --> 20:59.672
and the sooner we eliminate the
Maestro and his students, the better.

20:59.674 --> 21:02.978
Got you. Away we go.

21:07.115 --> 21:10.015
Then Barf ripped a burp unlike
anything you've ever heard

21:10.017 --> 21:12.817
and Bigsnot looked stunned.

21:12.819 --> 21:16.020
At first I thought that Bigsnot
was just as surprised as I was,

21:16.022 --> 21:18.457
but when
he didn't snap out of it,

21:18.459 --> 21:22.795
- I knew something was wrong.
- This is real bad news.

21:22.797 --> 21:25.798
I'm not sure what Barf's up to,
but I bet scallops to seaweed

21:25.800 --> 21:27.400
that the Maestro's in danger.

21:27.402 --> 21:28.968
I was thinking the same thing.

21:28.970 --> 21:31.403
Barf's always wanted
nothing more than

21:31.405 --> 21:33.638
to be the best burper
in the Sea of Schmerk,

21:33.640 --> 21:37.108
and the Maestro is the one fish
who stands in his way.

21:37.110 --> 21:39.711
We need to warn him.

21:39.713 --> 21:42.882
Yeah, but how? No one gets in
to see the Maestro

21:42.884 --> 21:44.749
unless they're
enrolled as students.

21:44.751 --> 21:47.452
I know someone
who might be able to help.

21:47.454 --> 21:50.955
You guys should seek out
the great and wise Bellyrumble.

21:50.957 --> 21:52.590
The great and what?

21:52.592 --> 21:54.527
Where can we find him,
Slimybuns?

21:54.529 --> 21:56.628
He lives in the Bay
of Runny Snot.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.431
A fortnight from here.

21:58.433 --> 22:01.200
A fortnight? We can't fight
knights in a fort.

22:01.202 --> 22:03.201
I don't even have hard scales.

22:03.203 --> 22:06.605
Easy, Mucus. A fortnight is
a measure of time.

22:06.607 --> 22:09.909
It's about 3,000 fin slaps away.

22:09.911 --> 22:12.877
Wow! That sounds far.

22:12.879 --> 22:15.114
I've never even been out of
the Sea of Schmerk.

22:15.116 --> 22:17.950
Now's your chance.
You want adventure, don't you?

22:17.952 --> 22:20.819
No, <i>you</i> want adventure, Charlie.

22:20.821 --> 22:23.689
I want a big bucket
of spores and mold.

22:23.691 --> 22:25.223
That's a big difference.

22:25.225 --> 22:28.626
Hey, we only live once.
We'll leave tonight.

22:28.628 --> 22:31.630
Oh, it's nice
to see I have a say.

22:31.632 --> 22:34.133
Mucus, we both grew up
with the Maestro.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.167
We both took his classes.

22:36.169 --> 22:39.140
The least we can do is warn him
of the possibility of an attack.

22:41.975 --> 22:44.210
I can't do this
without you, buddy.

22:44.212 --> 22:47.246
Oh, all right.

22:47.248 --> 22:49.214
That's my boy.

22:49.216 --> 22:51.549
I'll definitely need
a bucket of spores

22:51.551 --> 22:53.219
if we're gonna be swimming
that far, though.

22:53.221 --> 22:56.087
- I got to keep up my energy.
- Deal.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.233
I need a break, Squirtlips.

23:08.235 --> 23:10.970
These exercises are harder
than they look.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.538
Oh, welcome to competition, kid.

23:13.540 --> 23:16.942
It takes dedication
and sacrifice to be a champion.

23:16.944 --> 23:21.814
We can take a break, but it's a
good thing the Maestro isn't here.

23:21.816 --> 23:23.883
He'd never, he'd never allow it.

23:23.885 --> 23:25.220
I know he wouldn't.

23:26.220 --> 23:29.989
Squirtlips, do you think
I have what it takes?

23:29.991 --> 23:32.958
Do I think you have
what it takes to compete?

23:32.960 --> 23:37.128
Yes. Do I think you have
what it takes to win?

23:37.130 --> 23:40.766
Don't know. Those are
two different things, Corallina.

23:40.768 --> 23:46.271
Like the Maestro says, "Anyone can
train to compete, but only one can win."

23:46.273 --> 23:47.873
So let me ask you,

23:47.875 --> 23:49.807
are you here to compete

23:49.809 --> 23:52.310
or are you here to win?

23:52.312 --> 23:54.212
I don't know.

23:54.214 --> 23:57.816
Well, if you don't know,
who does?

23:57.818 --> 24:00.085
My father thinks he does.

24:00.087 --> 24:04.155
- And is your father here with us?
- No.

24:04.157 --> 24:07.326
- Does he even know where you are?
- No.

24:07.328 --> 24:09.595
What would he do if he did?

24:09.597 --> 24:11.599
He'd be so mad.

24:12.300 --> 24:17.102
- So, you're defying him?
- Yes.

24:17.104 --> 24:20.873
Don't you see? You've already
made your choice, Corallina.

24:20.875 --> 24:25.009
But I don't want to disappoint him.
I want to make him proud.

24:25.011 --> 24:28.747
And you think winning the Monster
Burping Contest will achieve that?

24:28.749 --> 24:30.214
Maybe.

24:30.216 --> 24:34.619
No. No, maybe. Yes or no.
Which is it?

24:34.621 --> 24:39.024
Well, my mother was a champion
burper before I was hatched.

24:39.026 --> 24:40.692
So I heard.

24:40.694 --> 24:44.063
And does she approve
of your plans?

24:44.065 --> 24:45.864
I haven't told her either.

24:45.866 --> 24:48.968
I think she'd be even more
surprised than my father,

24:48.970 --> 24:52.270
but not disappointed.
I know she'd be proud of me.

24:52.272 --> 24:56.942
Why do you think your father's so
reluctant to see you follow the stream?

24:56.944 --> 24:58.844
I don't know, Squirtlips.

24:58.846 --> 25:01.713
I know he hated seeing
how the negative remarks

25:01.715 --> 25:03.682
and naysayers affected my mother

25:03.684 --> 25:06.652
once she achieved
some notoriety.

25:06.654 --> 25:08.653
No dreams come easy, Corallina.

25:08.655 --> 25:11.089
Anytime our fins break
the surface,

25:11.091 --> 25:13.659
we risk becoming
a target of other creatures

25:13.661 --> 25:15.661
who don't know
how to build anything,

25:15.663 --> 25:20.665
so spend their time tearing down
the accomplishments of others.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.867
I never thought of it that way.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.804
You should start.
Once we get up on that stage,

25:25.806 --> 25:29.307
every move we make is fair game.

25:29.309 --> 25:31.644
You need a thick skin.

25:31.646 --> 25:34.012
Thanks for the advice,
Squirtlips.

25:34.014 --> 25:36.181
Don't mention it, kid.
I mean it.

25:36.183 --> 25:37.849
Don't tell the Maestro
we talked, okay?

25:37.851 --> 25:40.051
He'll think
I'm stepping on his fins,

25:40.053 --> 25:45.324
but he gave me the same talk
one time and I never forgot it.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.693
Okay, break's over.
Let's get back to work.

25:52.933 --> 25:55.267
It feels like
we've been swimming forever.

25:55.269 --> 25:59.003
I sure do hope this great and wise
Bellyrumble can help us, Char.

25:59.005 --> 26:01.306
It's not us
I'm worried about, Mucus.

26:01.308 --> 26:05.309
It's the Maestro. He needs us,
and he doesn't even know it.

26:05.311 --> 26:08.747
Hey look, we're here.
The bay of Runny Snot.

26:08.749 --> 26:11.720
Swimming straight through
sure has saved us a lot of time.

26:24.397 --> 26:29.101
Visitors,
what brings you to see me?

26:29.103 --> 26:32.471
Autographs? Photos? What?

26:32.473 --> 26:35.106
Uh, no, Mr. Bellyrumble.

26:35.108 --> 26:37.276
Although it's
an honor to meet you,

26:37.278 --> 26:40.913
a friend of ours is in a lot of
trouble and we were told you might...

26:40.915 --> 26:43.949
Ah, you were told?

26:43.951 --> 26:48.753
- Yes. We...
- Were told I might be

26:48.755 --> 26:52.924
of service to your needs.

26:52.926 --> 26:55.993
Uh, something like that.

26:55.995 --> 27:00.231
What kind of trouble
is your friend in?

27:00.233 --> 27:04.001
We think a couple of real bad
sea monsters are looking for him.

27:04.003 --> 27:06.038
You think?

27:06.040 --> 27:08.173
Ordinarily,
we wouldn't bother you

27:08.175 --> 27:10.241
with something like this,
Mr. Bellyrumble,

27:10.243 --> 27:13.479
but they have the power
of The Great and Magical Burp.

27:13.481 --> 27:18.217
Ah! The Great and Magical Burp.

27:18.219 --> 27:23.521
It's emptied seas, folded
plains, flattened mountains.

27:23.523 --> 27:27.459
I haven't seen it used in years.

27:27.461 --> 27:32.131
Tell me, who's been fool
enough to use it now?

27:32.133 --> 27:34.232
A sea monster named Barf.

27:34.234 --> 27:37.836
And he's brainwashed
sidekick, Bigsnot.

27:37.838 --> 27:41.006
Did you say Bigsnot?

27:41.008 --> 27:42.874
I'm afraid so, Mr. Bellyrumble.

27:42.876 --> 27:45.144
But he's really not
a bad monster.

27:45.146 --> 27:49.248
He's been put under a spell
by that foul sea cucumber, Barf.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.151
Um-hum.

27:52.153 --> 27:58.524
The Great and Magical Burp
can also damage minds.

27:58.526 --> 28:02.260
Especially big monster minds

28:02.262 --> 28:04.496
who, let's face it,

28:04.498 --> 28:08.834
aren't the sharpest fangs
in the maw.

28:08.836 --> 28:11.435
I think Bigsnot's fangs
are pretty sharp though.

28:11.437 --> 28:13.872
I saw him chew up
this coral reef one time.

28:13.874 --> 28:16.211
- He took it and he...
- Mucus.

28:18.345 --> 28:20.278
You two should know,

28:20.280 --> 28:23.481
environmental destruction
and mind control

28:23.483 --> 28:28.953
are only two of The Great
and Magical Burp's capabilities.

28:28.955 --> 28:31.022
You mean it gets worse?

28:31.024 --> 28:34.926
Oh, yeah. It gets much worse.

28:34.928 --> 28:41.465
Not only can The Great Burp cause anyone to
fall under its spell and become a minion,

28:41.467 --> 28:48.105
it also has the power to transport
monster fish across dimensions.

28:48.107 --> 28:52.277
Oh, fantastic.

28:52.279 --> 28:56.181
Really? That sounds
pretty bad to me, Char.

28:56.183 --> 28:59.183
What can we do to stop it,
Mr. Bellyrumble?

28:59.185 --> 29:02.421
I've never seen anyone stop it.

29:02.423 --> 29:04.522
There has to be a way.

29:04.524 --> 29:07.625
Maybe. If you find it,
let me know.

29:07.627 --> 29:10.261
I'm curious.

29:10.263 --> 29:14.168
Oh boy. This isn't what I was
hoping to hear at all.

29:15.135 --> 29:20.505
Me neither. I was hoping you
two were my pizza delivery.

29:20.507 --> 29:23.642
Pizza? You get pizza
delivered here?

29:23.644 --> 29:27.913
Mhm. Yes. Extra anchovy.

29:27.915 --> 29:34.219
One of the perks of being
the great and wise Bellyrumble.

29:34.221 --> 29:35.921
Wow.

29:35.923 --> 29:38.957
Mr. Bellyrumble,
if you were us and you cared

29:38.959 --> 29:42.227
about your friend's safety,
what would you do?

29:42.229 --> 29:44.997
That's easy.
I wouldn't hang out here.

29:44.999 --> 29:48.099
I'd go warn my friend
and be quick about it.

29:48.101 --> 29:50.469
One rip of The Great
and Magical Burp

29:50.471 --> 29:53.905
and you might never see
your friend again.

29:53.907 --> 29:58.509
Thanks, Mr. Bellyrumble.
Let's go, Mucus.

29:58.511 --> 30:02.614
- We have a long swim back.
- Argh. Don't remind me.

30:02.616 --> 30:07.251
Hey, Mr. Bellyrumble, you don't happen
to have any pizza slices left, do you?

30:07.253 --> 30:09.453
Only in here kid.

30:15.995 --> 30:20.699
Hey, that's a nice burp.
You ever think about competing?

30:20.701 --> 30:24.469
- Let's go, Mucus.
- Okay, okay.

30:36.149 --> 30:38.616
Did you hear
Bellyrumble's burp back there?

30:38.618 --> 30:42.421
It's a good thing he's not in
the competition. He might win.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.057
If there even is a competition.

30:45.059 --> 30:48.693
Oh no, are you talking about
another?

30:48.695 --> 30:52.631
No, Mucus. I'm talking about
the maniac swimming around

30:52.633 --> 30:54.967
with the magical burping power.

30:54.969 --> 30:58.569
There's no telling what he might
do before all this is over.

30:58.571 --> 31:03.107
Oh, he-he. Right. Well,
Bellyrumble had a good point.

31:03.109 --> 31:05.042
Let's find the Maestro,
and warn him.

31:05.044 --> 31:06.979
Maybe he'll have an idea.

31:06.981 --> 31:08.512
We'd have to figure out
a way to see him

31:08.514 --> 31:11.118
- without an appointment.
- I got it.

31:12.152 --> 31:16.153
- How?
- Let's pretend we're the pizza delivery guys.

31:26.367 --> 31:29.701
Remember, Bigsnot,
these skeleton fish are

31:29.703 --> 31:33.538
the only ones who can grant us
access to the Sea of Goo.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.607
When we get there,
you let me do the talking.

31:36.609 --> 31:40.578
You just hover
and look threatening.

31:40.580 --> 31:43.582
I can do that, Barf.

31:43.584 --> 31:47.419
You certainly can.
That's why I recruited you.

31:47.421 --> 31:52.524
These fools definitely have no
idea what's coming.

31:52.526 --> 31:55.697
I can't wait.

32:07.107 --> 32:12.176
Hey, hey there.
Could I help you two?

32:12.178 --> 32:15.713
I don't know, bones. Can you?

32:15.715 --> 32:20.751
Are you here
to see, see someone?

32:20.753 --> 32:23.755
What's your name, skeleton fish?

32:23.757 --> 32:29.428
I'm Gutless,
and, and, and you are?

32:29.430 --> 32:34.766
Here on business. We want to
enter the Sea of Goo immediately.

32:34.768 --> 32:39.471
Do, do, do, do you have
an, an appointment?

32:39.473 --> 32:44.544
An appointment?
No, we don't. But you do.

32:45.511 --> 32:48.646
Pa, pa, pa, pardon me?

32:48.648 --> 32:50.150
With Bigsnot here.

32:51.251 --> 32:55.252
Unless you grant us entry
and get out of our way.

32:55.254 --> 32:57.489
Understand?

32:57.491 --> 33:00.558
No, no, no pro, pro, problem.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.627
Go, go, go ri, ri, right ahead.

33:03.629 --> 33:05.465
En, enjoy your stay.

33:06.399 --> 33:08.636
Wise move, Gutless.

33:19.480 --> 33:23.381
What a cesspool
the Sea of Goo is.

33:23.383 --> 33:25.817
Excuse me?

33:25.819 --> 33:30.855
And who are you, ugly monsters?

33:30.857 --> 33:36.661
Oh, why I'm Barf, from the clear
waters of the Sea of Schmerk.

33:36.663 --> 33:40.332
And this is my friend, Bigsnot.

33:40.334 --> 33:43.434
Who might you be?

33:43.436 --> 33:48.405
Me? I'm the Great Gurgle Gut.

33:48.407 --> 33:55.480
These are my waters
you swim in, trespassers.

33:55.482 --> 34:01.685
And, if you don't like it,
you're free to leave.

34:01.687 --> 34:07.761
In fact I strongly suggest it.

34:08.728 --> 34:10.860
I have a better idea.

34:10.862 --> 34:14.165
How about we stick around
as long as we feel like it,

34:14.167 --> 34:17.502
and you do exactly as I say

34:17.504 --> 34:22.239
or I destroy you and your crummy
little lagoon along with you.

34:22.242 --> 34:24.676
Why you little...

34:26.612 --> 34:29.714
You think that scares me?

34:29.716 --> 34:34.217
I've defeated monsters
twice your size

34:34.219 --> 34:37.922
you overblown bottom-feeder.

34:37.925 --> 34:40.792
I'm sure you have, Gurglegut.

34:40.793 --> 34:45.929
But have you ever faced the raw
power of the Great and Magical Burp.

34:45.931 --> 34:49.935
Your bluffs won't
work on me, coward.

34:49.937 --> 34:53.536
You aren't
strong enough to wrangle

34:53.539 --> 34:59.243
the Great
and Magical Burp Power.

34:59.245 --> 35:01.182
Oh, no?

35:05.586 --> 35:09.321
I, I'm duly impressed.

35:09.323 --> 35:13.892
Oh, fine. I'll listen to you.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.727
What do you want?

35:16.729 --> 35:19.296
That's more like it.

35:19.298 --> 35:22.366
Now that we all know
our places here,

35:22.368 --> 35:26.270
I have a proposition
for you, Gurglegut.

35:26.272 --> 35:29.774
Why would I make any deal

35:29.776 --> 35:36.281
with the likes of you,
little barnacle of a thing?

35:36.283 --> 35:42.720
It's simple, great one.
If you refuse, I'll destroy you.

35:42.722 --> 35:47.392
I see, uhm, fine.
What do you propose?

35:47.394 --> 35:49.627
I thought you'd never ask.

35:49.629 --> 35:54.031
I was even prepared to hit you
with another magical burp,

35:54.033 --> 35:58.703
but the indigestion after two
is out of this world.

35:58.705 --> 36:04.475
I'm glad to see you're a
sensible, uh, whatever you are.

36:04.477 --> 36:07.845
My proposition is
a little barter, if you will.

36:07.847 --> 36:10.881
Make room in the stinkiest
part of your sea

36:10.883 --> 36:15.620
for the famous Maestro,
and keep him in there forever.

36:15.622 --> 36:19.357
In return
I will deliver you a bride

36:19.359 --> 36:22.861
to rule your sea by your side.

36:22.863 --> 36:25.729
A bride?

36:25.731 --> 36:29.868
Yeah. A beautiful one.

36:29.870 --> 36:34.004
Who might this bride be?

36:34.006 --> 36:36.975
Her name is Corallina.

36:36.977 --> 36:40.912
And she is a super cute
burping sea slug.

36:40.914 --> 36:44.015
A burping sea slug.

36:44.017 --> 36:46.484
Indeed.

36:46.486 --> 36:50.654
And all I have to do is

36:50.656 --> 36:53.957
imprison the Maestro?

36:53.959 --> 36:55.926
That's it. Just lock him up

36:55.928 --> 36:59.064
and any students
that might come after him.

36:59.066 --> 37:01.332
Hm.

37:01.334 --> 37:05.069
You have a deal.

37:05.071 --> 37:08.006
Splendid.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.941
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Gurglegut.

37:10.943 --> 37:15.846
That remains
to be seen, monster.

37:15.848 --> 37:21.720
When can I expect
this new bride?

37:21.722 --> 37:25.493
Just as soon as the Maestro
is out of circulation.

37:26.459 --> 37:30.830
Then he'll be found
and locked up immediately.

37:34.901 --> 37:37.736
How long before the
Sewage Run-Off Bay, Charlie?

37:37.738 --> 37:39.937
I'm tired and I'm starving.

37:39.939 --> 37:41.508
We're almost there, Muc.

37:50.883 --> 37:52.950
Hello, gentlemen.

37:52.952 --> 37:55.053
Can I help you with something?

37:55.055 --> 37:57.555
Hey, Squirtlips.
We need to see the Maestro.

37:57.557 --> 37:59.390
You and everybody else.

37:59.392 --> 38:01.091
The Maestro is
very busy, as you know.

38:01.093 --> 38:02.560
But it's important.

38:02.562 --> 38:04.662
I know. It always is.

38:04.664 --> 38:07.499
The Maestro conducts alumni
meet and greets every month.

38:07.501 --> 38:11.502
If you like to catch up with him
or any old classmates...

38:11.504 --> 38:15.874
It's not that, Squirtlips. The Maestro is
in grave danger. We've come to warn him.

38:15.876 --> 38:21.078
Ah, ooh. That's a new approach.
I haven't heard that one before.

38:21.080 --> 38:25.519
If you could just tell him Charlie Chapfin
and Mucus are here. It's very important.

38:31.191 --> 38:34.725
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Corallina.

38:34.727 --> 38:37.162
Hey, it isn't
break-time, Corallina.

38:37.164 --> 38:39.798
Keep practicing
your gill exercises.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.433
We're burping
for the Maestro in an hour.

38:42.435 --> 38:46.937
Burping? Are you entering the
Burping Monster Contest, Corallina?

38:46.939 --> 38:51.475
I'm, I'm, I'm, thinking
about it. Kind of.

38:51.477 --> 38:55.879
Thinking about it? Well, if you're
still just thinking about it, Corallina,

38:55.881 --> 38:59.551
why are we spending
all this time training?

38:59.553 --> 39:02.520
I can just work with the Maestro
like I've been doing,

39:02.522 --> 39:06.558
and get myself ready,
because I plan to win.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.826
Hey, you know what, Squirtlips?

39:08.828 --> 39:11.930
Corallina wasn't speaking to you. So
you can just butt right out of it.

39:11.932 --> 39:15.165
Ah! Oh! Well, I never...

39:15.167 --> 39:19.037
I'll take you to the Maestro, if
you really need to see him, Charlie.

39:19.039 --> 39:20.872
That'd be great, Corallina.

39:20.874 --> 39:23.207
Someone's looking to make
trouble for the burping contest,

39:23.209 --> 39:25.810
and the Maestro needs
to know about it right away.

39:25.812 --> 39:27.647
Oh no, follow me.

39:29.982 --> 39:31.915
Excuse me, Maestro?

39:31.917 --> 39:33.718
Yes.

39:33.720 --> 39:39.122
Charlie, Mucus!
It's been so long.

39:39.124 --> 39:41.725
How, how have you two been?

39:41.727 --> 39:47.999
We're well, Maestro, but I wish we were
visiting under better circumstances.

39:48.001 --> 39:49.933
Oh?

39:49.935 --> 39:52.069
What's the matter?

39:52.071 --> 39:55.973
It's Barf. Somehow he's mastered
the Great and Magical Burp.

39:55.975 --> 39:58.709
He's going to use it on you.

39:58.711 --> 40:00.980
On me?

40:03.249 --> 40:05.582
Nonsense!

40:05.584 --> 40:09.821
How did you two hear
about this wild sea story?

40:09.823 --> 40:12.756
We heard from a reliable friend.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.526
Aha-ha. Oh, yes.

40:15.528 --> 40:20.031
These reliable friends uh-huh,

40:20.033 --> 40:24.868
always seem to create
trouble out of thin water.

40:24.870 --> 40:27.238
I know it sounds
a bit wild, Maestro,

40:27.240 --> 40:29.941
but isn't it better
to be safe than sorry?

40:29.943 --> 40:34.044
Charlie, if you knew
how many sea monsters

40:34.046 --> 40:38.249
have attempted to hijack
our contests over the years,

40:38.251 --> 40:40.785
you'd be surprised.

40:40.787 --> 40:43.821
I'm going to carry on
as we have been,

40:43.823 --> 40:47.792
and let that chum fall
where it may.

40:47.794 --> 40:49.560
Chum? Where?

40:49.562 --> 40:52.629
I'm starving.
I sure could go for some chum.

40:52.631 --> 40:55.332
It's a figure of speech, Mucus.

40:55.334 --> 41:00.073
Maestro, I know this is all
far-fetched and out of Left Bay,

41:02.309 --> 41:04.308
but if you must go ahead
with the contest,

41:04.310 --> 41:07.645
could you do us a favor
and keep an eye out for Bigsnot?

41:07.647 --> 41:10.718
He's in league with Barf and if
he shows up, trouble's guaranteed.

41:11.618 --> 41:15.752
All right, Charlie.
If it'll make you feel better,

41:15.754 --> 41:18.089
I'll stay vigilant.

41:18.091 --> 41:23.026
After all, you're one of the
sharpest stings I've ever taught.

41:23.028 --> 41:24.831
Unlike some.

41:28.734 --> 41:33.604
Thank you, Maestro. And if you need any
help, don't hesitate to let us know.

41:33.606 --> 41:35.275
We'll do everything we can.

41:38.243 --> 41:41.979
And I still plan to win
that Burping Monster Contest.

41:41.981 --> 41:43.680
So do I.

41:46.218 --> 41:51.723
Yes, well,
bring your best burps.

41:51.725 --> 41:55.696
This year we'll see
some strong competition.

41:57.631 --> 42:01.665
Bigsnot, teaming up
with you has been more rewarding

42:01.667 --> 42:04.067
than I ever thought it would be.

42:11.176 --> 42:16.980
Thanks, Barf. I think it's been
rewarding for me too.

42:16.982 --> 42:18.816
You think?

42:18.818 --> 42:23.187
Well, I'm not really
in charge of my faculties.

42:23.189 --> 42:27.959
Ah, right. But I mean
you feel stronger, right?

42:27.961 --> 42:30.294
Mightier, more ferocious?

42:30.296 --> 42:34.332
Well, I am... Not really.

42:34.334 --> 42:38.035
More dazed and sleepwalking.

42:38.037 --> 42:40.705
I know I look savage and all,

42:40.707 --> 42:45.109
uh, but it's, it's like I think
about turning right

42:45.111 --> 42:47.211
but something compels me left.

42:47.213 --> 42:49.180
That kind of thing.

42:49.182 --> 42:51.182
Well, the Great and Magical Burp

42:51.184 --> 42:53.917
works in mysterious ways,
Bigsnot.

42:53.919 --> 42:58.756
Get used to it because once that
phony Maestro is eliminated,

42:58.758 --> 43:03.026
and I claim the title
of Best Burping Monster,

43:03.028 --> 43:05.095
the sea will be ours.

43:08.267 --> 43:11.169
Bah.

43:11.171 --> 43:12.970
Okay, ready?

43:12.972 --> 43:16.073
I'm now going to unleash
the burp that will knock

43:16.075 --> 43:18.743
the Maestro
right out of his fins.

43:23.348 --> 43:26.283
Well, thanks for giving us
your time, Maestro.

43:26.285 --> 43:32.022
Hopefully everything works out and we can
meet again soon, under better circumstances.

43:32.024 --> 43:36.727
And, Corallina, it, it was nice
seeing you again.

43:36.729 --> 43:38.863
Nice seeing you too, Charlie.

43:38.865 --> 43:40.932
Good luck in the contest.

43:40.934 --> 43:43.834
I'll, I'll see you,
see you out there.

43:43.836 --> 43:46.738
Mhm-hmm, yes, you will.

43:46.740 --> 43:49.173
Be well, Charlie.

43:49.175 --> 43:55.379
From the time you were a hatchling,
you've always shown such great potential,

43:55.381 --> 43:58.783
and you too, Mucus.

43:58.785 --> 44:01.986
Will you keep your eyes peeled
for Barf and Bigsnot, Maestro?

44:01.988 --> 44:05.959
For you two? Sure.

44:08.928 --> 44:15.433
I seriously doubt Barf's capacity
to cause even a minor inconvenience.

44:15.435 --> 44:19.069
Much less derail
the Burping Monster Contest.

44:19.071 --> 44:22.839
He simply does not
have the gravitas.

44:42.327 --> 44:45.095
What in the ocean
just happened back there?

44:45.097 --> 44:48.198
Yeah, where did the Maestro go?

44:48.200 --> 44:51.169
One second, he was there
and then the next...

44:51.171 --> 44:53.236
We tried to warn him, you guys.

44:53.238 --> 44:54.805
This is what
I was talking about.

44:54.807 --> 44:56.841
Barf's obviously behind this.

44:56.843 --> 45:00.178
Oh, no. What are we
going to do now?

45:00.180 --> 45:02.846
I don't know, Mucus.
I don't know.

45:02.848 --> 45:05.082
We can't just give up.

45:05.084 --> 45:07.450
Nobody said anything
about giving up.

45:07.452 --> 45:10.289
Yeah. Oh, oh, yes?

45:16.129 --> 45:20.198
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

45:20.200 --> 45:22.933
Looks like
a loser's party, Bigsnot.

45:22.935 --> 45:25.903
Sure does, Barf.

45:25.905 --> 45:29.105
Eat barnacles, you ugly mug.
We know what you did.

45:29.107 --> 45:30.508
You're not gonna
get away with it.

45:30.510 --> 45:34.544
No? Who's going to stop me, you?

45:34.546 --> 45:36.848
- Yeah.
- And me.

45:36.850 --> 45:37.848
And me.

45:37.850 --> 45:40.417
Ha! Three nobodies.

45:40.419 --> 45:43.354
Well, take your best shots,
clown fish.

45:43.356 --> 45:46.357
Bigsnot and I rule
the See of Schmerk now.

45:46.359 --> 45:50.194
And if you know what's good
for you, you'll migrate.

45:50.196 --> 45:53.029
If you know what's good for you,
you'll return the Maestro.

45:53.031 --> 45:55.299
That's right.
Don't make us find him.

45:55.301 --> 45:57.267
You won't like us,
if we have to find him.

45:57.269 --> 46:01.305
I don't like you now,
pickled sea cucumber.

46:01.307 --> 46:04.508
Alright, look, I don't know
why you hate us so much, Barf,

46:04.510 --> 46:07.078
but kidnapping the Maestro
won't get you anywhere?

46:07.080 --> 46:09.580
Au contraire, Chapfin.

46:09.582 --> 46:12.515
It already has gotten me
what I want.

46:12.517 --> 46:16.319
That old jellyfish is out of
the way, and the path is clear

46:16.321 --> 46:19.457
for me to win
the Burping Monster Contest.

46:19.459 --> 46:23.928
And not just that, but any of you
losers, who try to find the Maestro

46:23.930 --> 46:29.633
will end up just like him, gone.

46:29.635 --> 46:32.069
You're despicable, Barf.

46:32.071 --> 46:37.475
And you had better get
your white scales ready, Corallina.

46:37.477 --> 46:39.343
What's that supposed to mean?

46:39.345 --> 46:41.312
You'll see soon enough.

46:42.515 --> 46:44.415
Give up the chase, fools.

46:44.417 --> 46:47.285
Your precious Maestro is
a prisoner of none other

46:47.287 --> 46:51.988
than the Great Gurglegut in the
dreaded Sea of Goo.

46:51.990 --> 46:54.625
He's a memory never to return.

46:54.627 --> 46:59.397
And I would drop out of that burping
contest, if I were you.

46:59.399 --> 47:06.037
Anyone who opposes me will
incur Bigsnot's full wrath.

47:06.039 --> 47:08.138
Guys, this is worse
than I thought.

47:08.140 --> 47:09.439
What are we going to do now?

47:09.441 --> 47:11.107
We should split up.

47:11.109 --> 47:13.511
Squirtlips and I will
go to the Sea of Goo.

47:13.513 --> 47:16.113
Uh-huh, we will?

47:16.115 --> 47:19.049
Charlie, you and Mucus
head to Blister Bay

47:19.051 --> 47:22.520
and find the all-knowing
Abalone. He can help us.

47:22.522 --> 47:26.589
The all-knowing Abalone.
He is one mean mollusk.

47:26.591 --> 47:28.258
What do we tell him?

47:28.260 --> 47:30.995
Tell him
the Maestro needs his help.

47:30.997 --> 47:35.366
- Uh-huh. They go way back.
- They do?

47:35.368 --> 47:39.136
There's lots about the Maestro
that you guys don't know.

47:39.138 --> 47:43.473
Sounds like it. That Abalone is
one bad character, but we'll do it.

47:43.475 --> 47:45.979
- We will?
- Yes, we will.

47:47.046 --> 47:51.482
But Corallina, are you sure
about going to the Sea of Goo?

47:51.484 --> 47:53.620
- It can be dangerous.
- I'm sure, Charlie.

47:55.021 --> 47:57.421
Don't worry,
Squirtlips will look out for me.

47:57.423 --> 47:59.656
- I will?
- Yes.

47:59.658 --> 48:01.327
Right.

48:03.595 --> 48:09.265
Well, if it isn't
my old nemesis.

48:09.267 --> 48:13.537
Hello again, Maestro.

48:13.539 --> 48:17.441
Gurglegut,
you icky sewage runoff.

48:17.443 --> 48:22.379
I should've known you had
your fins in this slimy plot.

48:22.381 --> 48:25.249
Should have, could have,
would have, relic.

48:25.251 --> 48:32.522
But you didn't
and now you belong to me.

48:32.524 --> 48:38.095
Belong? You're as batty
as you've always been.

48:38.097 --> 48:43.700
Barf will win
the Burping Monster Title.

48:43.702 --> 48:48.406
Ha! Barf's never won
anything in his life,

48:48.408 --> 48:50.473
and it'll stay that way.

48:50.475 --> 48:54.511
And my faithful students
will soon find me,

48:54.513 --> 48:57.580
don't you worry about that.

48:57.582 --> 49:04.587
Yes, and when they are
foolish enough to come looking,

49:04.589 --> 49:09.125
the rest of Barf's plan
will be fulfilled.

49:09.127 --> 49:12.629
And I will marry

49:12.631 --> 49:17.267
the lovely Corallina.

49:19.539 --> 49:23.073
You what?
You've gone completely mad

49:23.075 --> 49:26.713
if you think
sweet Corallina will marry you.

49:27.613 --> 49:29.814
She will, I tell you.

49:29.816 --> 49:33.850
I'm a cute monster too.

49:33.852 --> 49:39.522
You'll see.
She will rule by my side

49:39.524 --> 49:42.593
for the rest of our days.

49:52.671 --> 49:55.673
Uh, er... Corallina, uh...

49:55.675 --> 49:58.676
How, how do we... Where do we...

49:58.678 --> 50:00.343
What do we...

50:00.345 --> 50:02.245
It's gonna be okay, Squirt.

50:02.247 --> 50:04.848
If we stick together,
we'll find the Maestro soon.

50:04.850 --> 50:06.450
We have to.

50:06.452 --> 50:09.153
Where do we start?

50:09.155 --> 50:12.591
The only place we can start,
Fish Stew Lagoon.

50:13.626 --> 50:16.660
Its waters aren't guarded, and
its skeleton fish can grant us

50:16.662 --> 50:18.796
quick entry to the Sea of Goo.

50:18.798 --> 50:20.430
You're sure about this?

50:20.432 --> 50:22.433
I'm not sure about anything
right now,

50:22.435 --> 50:25.703
except that Maestro needs us,
and it's the best idea I've got.

50:25.705 --> 50:27.638
Let's go.

50:33.513 --> 50:35.879
Charlie,
are you sure about this?

50:35.881 --> 50:38.549
I'm not sure
about anything right now, Mucus.

50:38.551 --> 50:43.620
- You have a better idea?
- No, but the all-knowing Abalone's notorious

50:43.622 --> 50:46.423
for his bad temper.
What if he refuses,

50:46.425 --> 50:48.392
or what if he attacks us?

50:48.394 --> 50:50.493
If he refuses, we'll leave.

50:50.495 --> 50:53.363
I plan to plead
our case as best as I can.

50:53.365 --> 50:55.165
So if he wants nothing
to do with us,

50:55.167 --> 50:57.667
and if he attacks us,
we'll fight.

50:57.669 --> 51:03.374
Gulp. But I'm a terrible fighter
and soft and slow.

51:03.376 --> 51:08.245
I won't be any good to you
in battle like, like, at all.

51:08.247 --> 51:11.182
Believing in yourself
is half the battle, Mucus.

51:11.184 --> 51:13.350
When we get there,
let me do the talking.

51:13.352 --> 51:16.654
Whatever happens,
just do your best.

51:16.656 --> 51:20.591
Okay.

51:20.593 --> 51:25.696
I think I'm gonna be sick. I need a big
bucket of sea spores to get my strength back.

51:25.698 --> 51:30.267
You know, I was all geared up for
a tough fight in this contest.

51:30.269 --> 51:34.305
And I was kinda looking forward
to it. And now... Argh.

51:34.307 --> 51:36.674
Now what, Barf?

51:36.676 --> 51:40.243
Now that my victory is
a foregone conclusion,

51:40.245 --> 51:44.415
there's no tension,
no anticipation, no mystery.

51:44.417 --> 51:50.287
I think I preferred it before when I thought
monsters might put up a good burping fight.

51:50.289 --> 51:55.325
You could always not use
the Great Magical Burping Power

51:55.327 --> 51:57.794
and make it a fair fight.

51:57.796 --> 52:01.265
That's preposterous.
Don't be silly, Bigsnot.

52:01.267 --> 52:05.669
The Great Magical Burping Power
is too fun not to use.

52:05.671 --> 52:10.841
Besides, the looks on those ugly
monsters' faces, will be well worth it.

52:10.843 --> 52:14.778
When they realize they don't
stand a chance against me,

52:14.780 --> 52:17.647
it'll be just golden.

52:17.649 --> 52:23.486
As golden as the trophy
I'll be awarded when it's over.

52:23.488 --> 52:26.857
If you say so.

52:26.859 --> 52:28.859
I do say so.

52:28.861 --> 52:32.562
Say, you're still on board,
aren't you, Bigsnot?

52:36.468 --> 52:41.337
Sure, Barf. Whatever you say.

52:41.339 --> 52:43.573
All right. Just making sure.

52:43.575 --> 52:46.776
I'd hate to use another
magical burp on you.

52:46.778 --> 52:48.812
Its power is so great.

52:48.814 --> 52:53.683
There are only so many burps one
monster can unleash, you know.

52:53.685 --> 52:57.955
And I'm saving my best and most
mighty burp ever for the stage.

53:06.064 --> 53:08.564
Are we almost there, Corallina?
It feels like

53:08.566 --> 53:11.634
we've been swimming
against the tide for hours.

53:11.636 --> 53:14.537
Yes. I think it's right up here,

53:14.539 --> 53:19.810
just around the... Oh,
Squirtlips, I've gotten us lost.

53:19.812 --> 53:22.879
I swear I thought I knew
where Fish Stew Lagoon was.

53:22.881 --> 53:25.948
It's okay. It's okay.
It can't be far.

53:25.950 --> 53:27.884
We'll find it, I hope.

53:27.886 --> 53:30.520
- I have an idea.
- Another one?

53:30.522 --> 53:32.723
No, really. My friend Moldspot

53:32.725 --> 53:34.857
can tell us how to get
to Fish Stew Lagoon.

53:34.859 --> 53:36.959
His reef isn't far.
Let's go see him.

53:38.497 --> 53:40.631
What did I get myself into?

53:40.633 --> 53:42.332
The adventure of a lifetime.

53:42.334 --> 53:43.834
And once we get
the Maestro back,

53:43.836 --> 53:46.602
it'll all be worth it.
You'll see.

53:46.604 --> 53:47.706
I hope you're right.

53:52.977 --> 53:54.578
Look, there he is.

53:54.580 --> 53:55.882
Where?

53:58.350 --> 53:59.950
There, it's Moldspot.

53:59.952 --> 54:03.520
That's your friend? Ew?

54:03.522 --> 54:05.723
Hey Moldy, remember me?

54:05.725 --> 54:07.725
Corallina? Wow.

54:07.727 --> 54:11.127
What brings you to the wrong
side of the reef, little one?

54:11.129 --> 54:13.863
Nothing good, I'm afraid.
I need your help.

54:13.865 --> 54:17.600
Ooh, who's the clownfish?

54:17.602 --> 54:21.571
- Clownfish? I'm not...
- This is my friend and classmate, Squirtlips.

54:21.573 --> 54:24.441
Say, what do you need help with?

54:24.443 --> 54:28.011
I was wondering if you can
guide us to Fish Stew Lagoon.

54:28.013 --> 54:32.082
I thought I knew where I was
swimming, but I only got us lost.

54:32.084 --> 54:35.651
Fish Stew Lagoon?
You don't want nothing to do

54:35.653 --> 54:38.020
with Fish Stew Lagoon
right now, little one.

54:38.022 --> 54:40.691
Trust me, it's a turmoil.

54:40.693 --> 54:42.493
But Moldy, I have to go.

54:42.495 --> 54:44.560
Our instructor, the Maestro,
has been kidnapped

54:44.562 --> 54:47.531
by a sea monster with the Great
and Magical Burping Power

54:47.533 --> 54:50.167
and he's being held captive
in the Sea of Goo.

54:50.169 --> 54:54.705
The fastest way to the Sea of Goo is through
the skeleton fish of Fish Stew Lagoon.

54:54.707 --> 54:57.808
Kriscoot, Corallina.
The skeleton fish have been

54:57.810 --> 55:00.410
in particularly
foul moods for weeks,

55:00.412 --> 55:05.549
ever since the great Gurglegut stole
their bones to build his new sea mansion.

55:05.551 --> 55:10.053
Is it just me, or does the news
just seem to get worse and worse?

55:10.055 --> 55:11.721
Moldy, please understand.

55:11.723 --> 55:14.057
We can't just turn
our gills on the Maestro.

55:14.059 --> 55:16.794
He's helped so many of us
for so long.

55:16.796 --> 55:19.763
We can't abandon him now.
We just can't.

55:19.765 --> 55:23.933
Uh... If I know you
like I think I do, Corallina,

55:23.935 --> 55:27.870
you'll never take
no for an answer.

55:27.872 --> 55:30.075
I know a shortcut
to Fish Stew Lagoon.

55:32.877 --> 55:37.180
But it takes you right past
Foul Fiord, home of Bluelips.

55:37.182 --> 55:39.649
Bluelips? Who's that?

55:39.651 --> 55:42.752
A dangerous
and unpredictable creature.

55:42.754 --> 55:44.988
He's not to be trifled with,
in these waters.

55:44.990 --> 55:49.826
The closer he is to home, the
more territorial and ornery he is.

55:49.828 --> 55:53.497
And my shortcut will take you
right through his lair.

55:53.499 --> 55:55.131
Oh, great.

55:55.133 --> 55:57.200
Thank you so much
for the tip, Moldy.

55:57.202 --> 55:59.770
We'll be extra careful,
I promise.

55:59.772 --> 56:03.105
If there's anything I can do
to dissuade you from going, I...

56:03.107 --> 56:06.810
We have to, Moldy. We care
too much about our Maestro.

56:06.812 --> 56:10.049
I understand,
but, but Corallina, if I may,

56:10.982 --> 56:14.250
your mother's side
of the family were all renowned

56:14.252 --> 56:17.187
and great burping monsters
of the sea.

56:17.189 --> 56:19.055
You may or may not know it yet

56:19.057 --> 56:22.926
but you posses
Great Burping Power of your own.

56:22.928 --> 56:25.828
It's all rumbling inside of you.

56:25.830 --> 56:28.966
You just have to realize it
and believe in yourself.

56:28.968 --> 56:33.136
Thank You, Moldy. We should shove
off, but I'll see you soon, okay?

56:33.138 --> 56:37.810
Okay. Be well, Corallina,
and Godspeed.

56:44.149 --> 56:46.216
How're you doing, Mucus?
You've been quiet.

56:46.218 --> 56:50.287
I'm worried, Charlie.
I don't know about this Abalone.

56:50.289 --> 56:52.555
The whole thing seems risky.

56:52.557 --> 56:53.656
I know. I know.

56:53.658 --> 56:56.026
But look at it this way,

56:56.028 --> 56:57.961
we don't have
anywhere else to turn.

56:57.963 --> 57:00.763
Corallina and Squirtlips are
taking chances on their end,

57:00.765 --> 57:03.901
we're doing the same on ours.
It's all we can do.

57:03.903 --> 57:06.537
And it's either us,
or abandon the Maestro.

57:06.539 --> 57:10.173
I don't think he'd abandon any of us
if the scales were on the other fish.

57:10.175 --> 57:12.875
Er, what other fish?

57:12.877 --> 57:14.711
Never mind, Mucus.

57:14.713 --> 57:17.714
Hey, here we are. Stay cool,

57:17.716 --> 57:21.151
and remember,
I'll do the talking.

57:21.153 --> 57:22.921
Sure, okay.

57:30.763 --> 57:33.330
What have we here? Two fish.

57:33.332 --> 57:36.732
And look at the time, lunchtime.

57:36.734 --> 57:41.805
Do yourselves a favor, fishies,
and hop right into my mug here.

57:41.807 --> 57:44.174
Save yourselves
a lot of trouble.

57:44.176 --> 57:47.778
- That sounds nice, Mr. Abalone.
- It does?

57:47.780 --> 57:49.645
But we're here on business.

57:49.647 --> 57:52.115
We have an emergency,
and a heck of a story to tell.

57:52.117 --> 57:56.986
Oh, yeah? I can't hear you.
Come closer, fishy.

57:56.988 --> 57:59.355
Don't do it, Char,
he wants to eat us.

57:59.357 --> 58:03.326
If it's all the same to you,
we'll stay over here, Mr. Abalone.

58:03.328 --> 58:07.196
I see.

58:07.198 --> 58:10.968
Maybe I'll come over there then.
Would that be better?

58:10.970 --> 58:12.368
Hm.

58:12.370 --> 58:14.604
Let's get out of here, Char.

58:14.606 --> 58:17.040
Let's just go.
We'll figure something else out.

58:17.042 --> 58:19.241
No, this is why we came, Mucus.

58:19.243 --> 58:21.981
And we're at least going
to explain our situation.

58:24.216 --> 58:29.720
Mr. Abalone, a terrible thing has befallen
our good friend and mentor, the Maestro.

58:29.722 --> 58:35.325
The Maestro. My old friend.
I hope everything's all right.

58:35.327 --> 58:38.662
Tell me, fishies,
what's the problem?

58:38.664 --> 58:42.765
So, you wait a minute,
you're not hungry anymore?

58:42.767 --> 58:45.267
No, I'm starving actually,

58:45.269 --> 58:49.673
and you two morsels
make my taste buds tingle.

58:49.675 --> 58:51.941
But I can put
that aside for a moment

58:51.943 --> 58:55.345
while your friend tells me
what he's talking about.

58:55.347 --> 58:57.980
Then, we can talk about lunch.

58:57.982 --> 59:00.917
Gulp. Nah. That's okay.

59:00.919 --> 59:04.053
A sea monster named Barf
used the Great and Magical Burp

59:04.055 --> 59:06.689
on the Maestro, banishing him
to the Sea of Goo

59:06.691 --> 59:09.926
where he's being held prisoner
by the great Gurglegut.

59:09.928 --> 59:13.196
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

59:13.198 --> 59:16.265
Trust me, it's the craziest
thing we've ever heard too.

59:16.267 --> 59:20.102
So, what brings you here?
Why have you sought me out?

59:20.104 --> 59:25.207
Our friend Corallina, who's also one of the
Maestro's new trainees, told us to come.

59:25.209 --> 59:29.379
You must really trust this
Corallina, little fishy.

59:29.381 --> 59:33.783
She's, she's the most
trustworthy sea monster I know.

59:33.785 --> 59:35.685
How touching.

59:35.687 --> 59:39.189
You must know the power
of the Great and Magical Burp

59:39.191 --> 59:42.993
is almost unbeatable
in all the ocean. Right?

59:42.995 --> 59:44.895
"Almost" means there's a chance.

59:44.897 --> 59:47.730
Yes, it does.

59:47.732 --> 59:52.334
And since it's
for my old friend, the Maestro,

59:52.336 --> 59:57.707
I'll give you fishies a tip. Find
the stink-crabs of Flatulating Lock,

59:57.709 --> 01:00:00.276
and procure their powerful vapor

01:00:00.278 --> 01:00:03.814
to reverse the spell
of the Great and Magical Burp.

01:00:03.816 --> 01:00:07.783
Only then can you free
the Maestro from his hold.

01:00:07.785 --> 01:00:10.120
Will do. Thanks,
all-knowing Abalone.

01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:14.323
Yes. Thanks.
We'll be going now.

01:00:14.325 --> 01:00:16.125
Hold on, chum.

01:00:16.127 --> 01:00:19.328
Why don't you come here
and pat my scales

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:23.299
for good luck on your way
to the Flatulating Lock.

01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:28.270
Uh-huh, that's okay. We have all
the luck we need, Mr. Abalone.

01:00:28.272 --> 01:00:31.410
We really should be...
Swim, Charlie, swim.

01:00:33.444 --> 01:00:39.950
Well, what in all the oceans
are you supposed to be?

01:00:39.952 --> 01:00:44.354
I see. Well, I'm supposed to be
the King of the Sea of Goo.

01:00:44.356 --> 01:00:46.990
But ever since
the Great Gurglegut turned me

01:00:46.992 --> 01:00:50.526
into a blasted sea donkey,
I've looked like this.

01:00:50.528 --> 01:00:54.196
The King of the Sea of Goo?

01:00:54.198 --> 01:00:57.500
I heard you were fish fry.

01:00:57.502 --> 01:01:03.006
Well I'm not, and no one will
ever take me seriously again.

01:01:03.008 --> 01:01:07.944
Gurglegut's behind this?
Why did he do it?

01:01:07.946 --> 01:01:10.080
Jealous of my position,
I assume.

01:01:10.082 --> 01:01:12.982
Probably the same reason
you're here.

01:01:12.984 --> 01:01:15.986
Oh, I was betrayed
by a sea monster

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:19.823
who never had the talent
to be one of my students.

01:01:19.825 --> 01:01:23.392
He struck a deal
with Gurglegut to trap me here

01:01:23.394 --> 01:01:29.267
and steal the Burping Monster
Contest, back in the Sea of Schmerk.

01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:35.004
Ah, conspiracy.
That age old popper of kingdoms.

01:01:35.006 --> 01:01:38.941
Gurglegut plans
to force my student,

01:01:38.943 --> 01:01:42.979
Corallina,
into marriage against her will.

01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:44.881
Great oceans!

01:01:44.883 --> 01:01:48.218
They are taking everything
they can from you, Maestro.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.589
Yes, it, it will appear so.

01:01:52.591 --> 01:01:57.459
Look on the bright side, you haven't
been turned into a sea-donkey.

01:01:57.461 --> 01:02:04.466
Well, if there is a bright side,
King, I suppose that will be it.

01:02:04.468 --> 01:02:06.303
I'll tell you what, Maestro,

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:10.473
how about you and I strike
a little deal of our own?

01:02:10.475 --> 01:02:16.145
You help me overthrow Gurglegut, and I'll
help you return to the Sea of Schmerk.

01:02:16.147 --> 01:02:19.482
It looks like we're
each other's best out.

01:02:19.484 --> 01:02:23.620
You have a deal.

01:02:23.622 --> 01:02:27.624
I see. Excellent.
You won't regret it, Maestro.

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:31.962
For now, we'll keep our mouths
shut and our eyes open.

01:02:31.964 --> 01:02:35.265
No one even needs
to know we've met.

01:02:35.267 --> 01:02:36.535
Agreed.

01:02:41.006 --> 01:02:44.307
It's near dark.
We just began our journey

01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:47.877
and already we almost got eaten
for lunch by a sea monster.

01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:52.515
And add insult to injury,
I haven't eaten my lunch yet.

01:02:52.517 --> 01:02:56.285
Like I told that Abalone, Mucus,
almost means we're still in the game.

01:02:56.287 --> 01:03:01.057
I'm sorry, Char, but this is no
game. This is serious.

01:03:01.059 --> 01:03:04.160
It was just
a figure of speech, Mucus.

01:03:04.162 --> 01:03:06.595
Stay the course with me, buddy.

01:03:06.597 --> 01:03:12.002
If we swim fast and get the right help,
we can save the Maestro and Corallina.

01:03:12.004 --> 01:03:14.537
Do you really think
she's in danger?

01:03:14.539 --> 01:03:17.073
Did you hear what Barf said
about her earlier?

01:03:17.075 --> 01:03:19.209
That white scales' remark?

01:03:19.211 --> 01:03:21.611
I think he's going to try
to force her into marriage.

01:03:21.613 --> 01:03:25.582
Probably to Gurglegut in exchange
for keeping the Maestro locked up.

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:29.218
This whole thing just stinks
worse and worse, Charlie.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:33.423
And now, we got to bring more magic
into the mix with these vapors.

01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:35.625
I just don't know
if this is a good idea.

01:03:35.627 --> 01:03:37.993
Mucus, if there's
anything in the sea

01:03:37.995 --> 01:03:40.330
we can do to save the Maestro,
I'm going to do it.

01:03:40.332 --> 01:03:44.167
And if there's anyone who can do
it, it's the four of us.

01:03:44.169 --> 01:03:47.437
You sure know how to make
a sea slug feel better, Char.

01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:50.609
I wonder how Corallina and
Squirtlips are doing out there.

01:03:56.381 --> 01:03:59.015
Corallina, my life was
a lot easier

01:03:59.017 --> 01:04:01.685
before you came into
the picture. You know that?

01:04:01.687 --> 01:04:04.453
I'm not sure how to take that,
Squirtlips.

01:04:04.455 --> 01:04:09.491
Take it at face value. You're
a royal pain in the dorsal fin.

01:04:09.493 --> 01:04:13.330
Well, you are no surface float
on a sunny day yourself, Squirt.

01:04:13.332 --> 01:04:16.602
Coming from you,
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:04:17.568 --> 01:04:20.038
Hey, where are we anyway?

01:04:26.577 --> 01:04:30.145
Didn't you see the sign?

01:04:30.147 --> 01:04:33.582
No, I didn't see a... What sign?

01:04:33.584 --> 01:04:38.254
No trespassing.

01:04:38.256 --> 01:04:41.390
Well, sue me. Here we are.

01:04:41.392 --> 01:04:45.395
Please let me apologize
for my friend Mr... uh...

01:04:45.397 --> 01:04:47.497
Bluelips.

01:04:47.499 --> 01:04:52.201
Bluelips! My name's Corallina,
and this is Squirtlips.

01:04:52.203 --> 01:04:54.671
He's a bit high strung lately.

01:04:54.673 --> 01:05:00.642
We were just passing through.
Uh, lovely den you have here.

01:05:00.644 --> 01:05:05.147
I hear that all the time.

01:05:05.149 --> 01:05:08.084
- You do?
- Mhm.

01:05:08.086 --> 01:05:11.787
I could charge admission.

01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:14.024
Yeah, right.

01:05:14.026 --> 01:05:19.261
Starting now.
Five Schmerk dollars.

01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:24.299
- Excuse me?
- Hey, we're not paying you just to swim by.

01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:28.303
Oh, but you didn't swim by,
clownfish.

01:05:28.305 --> 01:05:32.341
You swam in.

01:05:32.343 --> 01:05:37.147
I'm gonna say it one more time:
I'm not a clownfish.

01:05:37.149 --> 01:05:40.216
Could have fooled me.

01:05:40.218 --> 01:05:43.153
Mr. Bluelips,
maybe you could help us.

01:05:43.155 --> 01:05:46.555
We seem to have gotten lost
on our way to Fish Stew Lagoon.

01:05:46.557 --> 01:05:50.459
Oh, so first we trespass,

01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:53.830
then we want
something for nothing.

01:05:53.832 --> 01:05:56.265
We don't mean any harm.
We just...

01:05:56.267 --> 01:05:59.134
Our teacher is in a lot of
trouble and we're trying to help.

01:05:59.136 --> 01:06:03.406
But it seems like we keep getting the
run-around and we don't have much time.

01:06:03.408 --> 01:06:05.607
If I had a shrimp-kebab

01:06:05.609 --> 01:06:10.712
for every time I heard
an excuse around here,

01:06:10.714 --> 01:06:13.515
you know what I'd be?

01:06:13.517 --> 01:06:16.618
Morbidly obese.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:23.158
No. I was going to say
I'd be King of Schmerk.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.095
A fat king of Schmerk.

01:06:25.097 --> 01:06:28.564
Okay, wise guy.
I'll tell you what,

01:06:28.566 --> 01:06:33.470
I know how to get
to Fish Stew Lagoon.

01:06:33.472 --> 01:06:37.506
You do? Oh, we'd be
so grateful, Mr. Bluelips.

01:06:37.508 --> 01:06:39.741
Save it, sea monster.

01:06:39.743 --> 01:06:42.178
I'll show you to the way,

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.484
if you do something
for me first.

01:06:47.419 --> 01:06:49.419
Uhm, what is that?

01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:51.620
I want you to solve

01:06:51.622 --> 01:06:54.390
a riddle.

01:06:54.392 --> 01:06:56.792
A riddle given to me

01:06:56.794 --> 01:07:01.631
2000 Schmerk years ago.

01:07:01.633 --> 01:07:06.569
And I can't seem to solve it.
It's driving me batty.

01:07:06.571 --> 01:07:09.205
And if we don't?

01:07:09.207 --> 01:07:12.674
Then you're on your own.

01:07:12.676 --> 01:07:14.743
And be forewarned,

01:07:14.745 --> 01:07:18.584
there are killer whales
in these waters.

01:07:19.484 --> 01:07:25.254
If you don't know exactly how to
navigate your way out of here,

01:07:25.256 --> 01:07:28.258
you're as good as chum.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.530
The both of you.

01:07:34.598 --> 01:07:37.167
What is the riddle,
Mr. Bluelips?

01:07:37.169 --> 01:07:41.303
Oh, that's the spirit.
Here it goes.

01:07:41.305 --> 01:07:47.178
How do you communicate with a
monster that lives on the seabed?

01:07:49.948 --> 01:07:53.616
- Hmm. Umm...
- Pshaw.

01:07:53.618 --> 01:07:57.787
I get a feeling the sea cucumber
has a line for every occasion.

01:07:57.789 --> 01:08:00.723
- Yes, that's it.
- What is?

01:08:00.725 --> 01:08:03.692
Yeah, what is?

01:08:03.694 --> 01:08:07.133
How do you communicate with a
monster that lives on the seabed?

01:08:08.365 --> 01:08:12.602
Drop him a line.
Get it? Huh? Yeah?

01:08:12.604 --> 01:08:14.604
Ah...

01:08:14.606 --> 01:08:15.971
Is that it?

01:08:15.973 --> 01:08:19.908
Wow, you solved it.

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:24.345
My poor brain feels
better already.

01:08:24.348 --> 01:08:26.349
Woo-hoo.

01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:30.219
Really? That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.555
Oh, shush, Squirtlips.

01:08:32.555 --> 01:08:34.357
There you have it, Mr. Bluelips.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.759
Now, could you uphold
your end of the bargain?

01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:39.661
I could.

01:08:39.662 --> 01:08:41.867
But I'm not gonna.

01:08:42.867 --> 01:08:48.270
- What? But...
- Welcome to the big blue sea, monsters.

01:08:49.673 --> 01:08:53.877
Consider this
a learning experience.

01:08:54.812 --> 01:08:57.714
Don't trust
any old fish you meet.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:01.584
Good luck, suckers.

01:09:06.357 --> 01:09:07.857
Why, you little...

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:10.425
Don't waste your time,
Squirt, he's gone.

01:09:10.426 --> 01:09:12.327
It's probably for the best.

01:09:12.328 --> 01:09:14.930
Yeah, but now we,
we're apparently

01:09:14.932 --> 01:09:17.032
surrounded by killer whales.

01:09:17.033 --> 01:09:19.469
What a mess we've gotten
ourselves into.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.572
Shh, keep your voice down.
Remember that riddle?

01:09:22.573 --> 01:09:26.309
We'll crawl along the ocean
floor until we're in the clear.

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:29.312
No predators will ever
spot us down here.

01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:31.581
I hope you're right.

01:09:31.582 --> 01:09:35.617
So do I. My track record
hasn't been great today.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:36.854
Come on, stay close.

01:09:42.459 --> 01:09:46.662
Ugh, we must be getting close.
It stinks out here.

01:09:49.066 --> 01:09:51.667
Use mind over matter, Mucus.

01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:54.770
You mean like, uh,
breathe through my gills?

01:09:54.772 --> 01:09:56.906
Well, we do that anyway.

01:09:56.908 --> 01:09:59.408
All right.

01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:02.077
It smells even worse.
Are we there yet?

01:10:02.079 --> 01:10:05.682
If this isn't that...
What's it called again?

01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:08.017
The Flatulating Lock.

01:10:08.019 --> 01:10:10.486
Yeah, that. If this isn't it,

01:10:10.488 --> 01:10:12.955
I don't know
if we should even continue.

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:17.460
I think we've arrived.

01:10:17.462 --> 01:10:22.365
Where do you think we can
find one of those stink-crabs, Char?

01:10:22.367 --> 01:10:27.437
Well, judging by the smell emanating
from this volcano, they can't be far.

01:10:27.439 --> 01:10:30.005
You called?

01:10:30.007 --> 01:10:33.009
Whoa. Yes.

01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:34.743
That's going to take
some getting used to.

01:10:34.745 --> 01:10:36.078
Wow.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.648
I got this, Char.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:42.684
Hiya, Mr. Stink Crab.

01:10:42.686 --> 01:10:46.022
Call me Tickle-Tickle.

01:10:46.024 --> 01:10:49.826
Okay. Let's get right
to the point, yeah?

01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:55.665
Because, you know,
I think I might pass out.

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:59.035
Tickle-Tickle, we've come all the
way from the Sea of Schmerk, and...

01:10:59.037 --> 01:11:00.836
The Sea of Schmerk?

01:11:00.838 --> 01:11:02.904
Ah, I visited once.

01:11:02.906 --> 01:11:05.608
It smells kind of funny there.

01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:08.777
If you say so.
The reason we're here is,

01:11:08.779 --> 01:11:11.813
ugh, our friend is in trouble.

01:11:14.418 --> 01:11:16.521
And we need this stuff to save him.

01:11:17.454 --> 01:11:18.821
What's it called again?

01:11:18.823 --> 01:11:20.889
The all...

01:11:20.891 --> 01:11:25.761
The all-powerful vapor
of the Flatulating Lock.

01:11:25.763 --> 01:11:29.131
Is that so?
And how would you like it?

01:11:29.133 --> 01:11:34.136
Bottled, canned, injected
straight into your nostrils?

01:11:34.138 --> 01:11:36.438
Gross.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.876
Please, no.
I don't want it in my nostrils.

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.947
You silly fish. The vapor
cannot treat it like that.

01:11:45.949 --> 01:11:48.417
It's our natural resource.

01:11:48.419 --> 01:11:52.554
It sounds like you're seeking
some magical talisman,

01:11:52.556 --> 01:11:55.057
but you don't understand
what you're after.

01:11:55.059 --> 01:11:57.960
We were told the vapor
can undo the power of...

01:11:57.962 --> 01:12:01.096
The...

01:12:01.098 --> 01:12:03.899
The Great and Magical Burp
that hurt our friend.

01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:06.969
Oh, it can.

01:12:06.971 --> 01:12:11.840
- Then, how can we...
- Utilize it?

01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:17.546
There are ways, but the vapor's
power is not to be taken lightly.

01:12:17.548 --> 01:12:19.782
It's not like
uncorking a bottle.

01:12:19.784 --> 01:12:27.089
Misuse it, and you might find
yourselves lost at sea forever.

01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:28.624
Forever?

01:12:28.626 --> 01:12:32.627
Forever, and you'll stink so bad

01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:37.834
no sea creature will want to get
close enough to help you, ever.

01:12:37.836 --> 01:12:40.836
Oh, no, Char.

01:12:40.838 --> 01:12:42.004
It's not worth it.

01:12:42.006 --> 01:12:43.872
I think we should turn back.

01:12:43.874 --> 01:12:45.707
We can't turn back now, Mucus,

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:48.544
we have to see it through,
for the Maestro,

01:12:48.546 --> 01:12:49.748
and for Corallina.

01:13:04.995 --> 01:13:07.529
Ooh, whoa.

01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:09.732
Are, are you all right?

01:13:22.513 --> 01:13:25.814
Are you having an allergic
reaction or something?

01:13:25.816 --> 01:13:29.285
The only thing I'm allergic to
is failure, Bigsnot.

01:13:29.287 --> 01:13:33.089
And I don't know failure,
because I win.

01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:35.992
I win big.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:38.160
Oh. I see.

01:13:38.162 --> 01:13:42.631
Bigsnot, after my now assured
victory in the burping contest,

01:13:42.633 --> 01:13:47.303
I'm gonna take some of my sponsorship
money and treat you to a vacation.

01:13:48.739 --> 01:13:50.105
Where would you like to go, pal?

01:13:50.107 --> 01:13:52.541
You, you just name it.

01:13:52.543 --> 01:13:57.712
Oh, you know, I'd like to just
float on the surface a while.

01:13:57.714 --> 01:14:02.184
It's hard to deal with what with
people pointing and screaming.

01:14:02.186 --> 01:14:07.723
Well, when I win the
contest, I'll send you to float far away

01:14:07.725 --> 01:14:10.626
where nobody will see you,
Bigsnot.

01:14:10.628 --> 01:14:12.594
I sure hope so.

01:14:12.596 --> 01:14:14.729
Eh! Speaking of people laughing,

01:14:14.731 --> 01:14:17.567
you are aware, aren't you,

01:14:17.569 --> 01:14:23.305
that there is one power that can override
the power of the Great and Magical Burp?

01:14:23.307 --> 01:14:25.107
There is?

01:14:25.109 --> 01:14:29.010
Sure is.
It's the all-powerful vapor

01:14:29.012 --> 01:14:31.714
of the Flatulating Lock.

01:14:31.716 --> 01:14:35.117
Your burp stands
no chance against it.

01:14:35.119 --> 01:14:38.888
- There you go again.
- What, what?

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.290
Pointing out
how my plans can go awry.

01:14:41.292 --> 01:14:46.094
What is it with you, you big
lug? You're under mind control.

01:14:46.096 --> 01:14:49.165
That means you should agree
with everything I say or do.

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:50.899
That's the whole point.

01:14:50.901 --> 01:14:53.301
It is? Why?

01:14:53.303 --> 01:14:56.037
Because I'm the boss.

01:14:56.039 --> 01:14:58.741
Sure you are.

01:14:58.743 --> 01:15:01.743
And I call the shots.

01:15:01.745 --> 01:15:03.645
Sure. You do.

01:15:03.647 --> 01:15:07.716
All right.
Help me run some gill exercises.

01:15:07.718 --> 01:15:10.385
And not another mention
of the vapor.

01:15:10.387 --> 01:15:13.188
All is good
in the Sea of Schmerk,

01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:17.660
and I will win the contest.
Repeat after me, Bigsnot.

01:15:17.662 --> 01:15:22.732
All is good in the Sea of Schmerk
and you will win the contest.

01:15:22.734 --> 01:15:25.134
- Good.
- Unless, of course, somebody gets a hold

01:15:25.136 --> 01:15:29.037
of the all-powerful vapor of the
Flatulating Lock, that is.

01:15:29.039 --> 01:15:30.206
Argh.

01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:33.709
Here you are, monsters.

01:15:33.711 --> 01:15:37.145
The entrance to the center
of the Flatulating Lock.

01:15:37.147 --> 01:15:40.182
Wow.

01:15:40.184 --> 01:15:41.951
Impressive, eh?

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:46.287
Sure is.

01:15:46.289 --> 01:15:52.294
You can smell the power.

01:15:52.296 --> 01:15:59.402
- Sure, can.
- It's like gazing deep into the bowels of a great Megalodon.

01:15:59.404 --> 01:16:02.871
Yep, deep into the bowels.

01:16:02.873 --> 01:16:06.308
Not everyone
is granted this entry.

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:08.376
Uh, lucky us.

01:16:08.378 --> 01:16:14.149
Indeed.
Inside, you will meet Tiptoes,

01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:20.723
our stink-crab guardian of the
all-powerful vapor of the Flatulating Lock.

01:16:20.725 --> 01:16:24.059
He will either assist you
in your mission,

01:16:24.061 --> 01:16:28.029
or curse you with the stink
of the vapor for all eternity.

01:16:28.031 --> 01:16:33.202
This is where you can win
or lose it all, travelers.

01:16:33.204 --> 01:16:35.938
So, the stakes
aren't very high then.

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:40.843
Char, the stakes have never
been higher. Pay attention.

01:16:40.845 --> 01:16:42.310
Oh, Mucus.

01:16:42.312 --> 01:16:45.880
Be careful, monsters.

01:16:45.882 --> 01:16:49.919
And good luck. I mean it.

01:16:49.921 --> 01:16:52.888
Thanks, Tickle-Tickle.
You've really done us a solid.

01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:54.756
I hope so.

01:16:54.758 --> 01:16:57.425
Solid waste is always
greatly appreciated

01:16:57.427 --> 01:16:59.929
in the Flatulating Lock.

01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:02.163
In you go, monsters.

01:17:16.314 --> 01:17:20.416
Char, I don't know if I can
make it. This is wretched.

01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:24.786
Stay strong, Mucus.
Think of the Maestro.

01:17:24.788 --> 01:17:28.491
Yuck. All I'm thinking of
right now, is smelling-salt.

01:17:30.861 --> 01:17:34.362
Visualize a bucket of fragrant
delicious, mutant spores, Mucus.

01:17:34.364 --> 01:17:35.997
That should help.

01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:39.434
Hmm. Mutant spores? Yum!

01:17:39.436 --> 01:17:42.339
Hold onto that vision,
Mucus, and push on.

01:17:45.776 --> 01:17:48.010
Freeze, sea slugs.

01:17:48.012 --> 01:17:50.880
Slugs? We're monsters, you know.

01:17:50.882 --> 01:17:53.249
Hey. I am Googly-Brow.

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:57.219
And whatever you are,
this is where you stop.

01:17:57.221 --> 01:17:59.788
But Tickle-Tickle sent us.
We're on official business

01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:02.524
from the Sea of Schmerk,
to meet Tiptoes the stink-crab.

01:18:02.526 --> 01:18:05.126
Official business, huh?

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:07.129
The officialest.

01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:10.832
Well then, I'll grant you
monsters an official out.

01:18:10.834 --> 01:18:13.568
But if you can't solve
my official riddle,

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:18.072
you will be officially up
Schmerk Creek without a paddle.

01:18:18.074 --> 01:18:20.108
Gee, wow.

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:23.379
If that's the way
we have to do it, let's do it.

01:18:23.381 --> 01:18:26.982
That's the spirit.
Okay now, answer this

01:18:26.984 --> 01:18:31.187
and you may proceed
to Tiptoes' lair.

01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:34.189
Fail and wail.

01:18:34.191 --> 01:18:37.593
I wouldn't fail if I were you.

01:18:37.595 --> 01:18:39.527
Understood. Let's have it.

01:18:41.364 --> 01:18:45.901
What lays on the bottom
of the sea and shakes?

01:18:45.903 --> 01:18:50.406
What lies on the bottom
of the sea and shakes?

01:18:57.181 --> 01:19:02.117
Oh, Char, I can't solve it.
I just can't.

01:19:02.119 --> 01:19:05.019
Pull yourself together,
Mucus, you're a wreck.

01:19:05.021 --> 01:19:07.255
- That's it.
- What's it?

01:19:07.257 --> 01:19:10.425
What lies on the bottom
of the sea floor and shakes?

01:19:10.427 --> 01:19:12.995
A nervous wreck.

01:19:18.202 --> 01:19:20.236
Is that right, Mr. Googly-Brow?

01:19:20.238 --> 01:19:24.974
How, argh, how could these two
rogues solve my riddle?

01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:27.242
It was one of my best ones.

01:19:27.244 --> 01:19:29.010
Yeah!

01:19:29.012 --> 01:19:33.115
Well, good for you.
Enjoy your stay, monsters.

01:19:33.117 --> 01:19:35.520
Oh. Which way to Tiptoes' lair?

01:19:36.454 --> 01:19:40.421
Keep swimming. You won't find
him, he'll find you.

01:19:40.423 --> 01:19:43.658
And if you're considering
lying to him,

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.832
good, he can read your minds.

01:19:51.202 --> 01:19:53.902
I think we're clear of killer
whales, Corallina.

01:19:53.904 --> 01:19:56.604
I can't believe your plan works.

01:19:56.606 --> 01:20:00.041
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Squirt.
And I think you're right.

01:20:00.043 --> 01:20:02.277
Let's spread our fins
and get off the ocean floor.

01:20:02.279 --> 01:20:03.881
My gills are muddy.

01:20:10.421 --> 01:20:14.156
This is it, Squirtlips.
We're in the Fish Stew Lagoon.

01:20:14.158 --> 01:20:20.030
Uh... I'd love a postcard or a snail
glow or something, while we're here.

01:20:24.568 --> 01:20:31.307
Billy-up, creatures. Who are you and
why have you entered this revered space?

01:20:31.309 --> 01:20:36.679
We mean no harm, fish. We're trying to help
a dear friend and teacher, the Maestro.

01:20:36.681 --> 01:20:41.082
You may have heard of him.
And our journey has led us here.

01:20:41.084 --> 01:20:45.286
The Maestro?
And, and who are you?

01:20:45.288 --> 01:20:49.692
We're his students. I'm Corallina,
and this is my colleague, Squirtlips.

01:20:49.694 --> 01:20:53.127
- And you are?
- In charge.

01:20:53.129 --> 01:20:57.198
I am Gutless, the gatekeeper
of Fish Stew Lagoon.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.103
And I'm sorry to hear
the Maestro's got problems

01:21:01.105 --> 01:21:03.438
but we can't help you.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.407
- Oh. But...
- No buts.

01:21:06.409 --> 01:21:11.080
We don't just allow any old fish
to enter our waters.

01:21:11.082 --> 01:21:15.718
Oh, wait. Did you say
your name was Corallina?

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.118
Yes.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.721
Say, is your mother

01:21:19.723 --> 01:21:23.192
the great Burping Monster,

01:21:23.194 --> 01:21:25.995
Priscilla Cracker Fish?

01:21:25.997 --> 01:21:28.730
- Yes. Yes, she is.
- Oh, my god.

01:21:28.732 --> 01:21:35.237
Oh! My sisters had her picture on our
cave wall when we were just hatchlings.

01:21:35.239 --> 01:21:39.308
Really? Oh, wow.
She'd love to know that.

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:43.644
Tell her Gutless from Fish
Stew Lagoon says hello.

01:21:43.646 --> 01:21:50.219
And if she ever like
to visit, she has carte blanche.

01:21:50.221 --> 01:21:54.023
Uhm-uhm, Mr. Gutless,
if Corallina's famous mom

01:21:54.025 --> 01:21:58.493
has a standing invitation,
does that mean we do too?

01:21:58.495 --> 01:22:02.764
Yes, it does.
Swim on, me friends.

01:22:02.766 --> 01:22:05.401
And if you need help,

01:22:05.403 --> 01:22:10.406
you need to talk to our leader,
Wishbone The Mighty.

01:22:10.408 --> 01:22:14.175
Thank you so much, Gutless. I'll be
sure to tell my mom all about this.

01:22:14.177 --> 01:22:18.679
Make my heart go pitter-patter,
why don't you?

01:22:18.681 --> 01:22:20.314
Oh, just between us,

01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:22.550
Wishbone The Mighty
has been more like

01:22:22.552 --> 01:22:24.786
Wishbone The Crabby today.

01:22:24.788 --> 01:22:29.491
If he gives you a hard time,
take it with a grain of sea salt.

01:22:29.493 --> 01:22:33.194
He and the Maestro go way back.

01:22:33.196 --> 01:22:40.669
And he's also a big fan of your mom's.
Remember, Gutless says hi.

01:22:40.671 --> 01:22:43.738
Let's hurry
before fanboy changes his mind.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.375
Right. Thank you, Gutless.

01:22:46.377 --> 01:22:50.078
Bigsnot, I've been thinking
about what you said earlier.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.447
About the buttered scallops?

01:22:52.449 --> 01:22:56.218
It's all true.
They're to die for.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.389
No, no, no. About the all-powerful
vapor of the Flatulating Lock.

01:23:00.391 --> 01:23:03.224
- Oh, that.
- Yes, that.

01:23:03.226 --> 01:23:06.127
I want you to find
that vapor and bring it to me

01:23:06.129 --> 01:23:09.398
so that I can destroy it
once and for all.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:16.671
If it can impede my new power, I don't
want it out there for any old fish to find.

01:23:16.673 --> 01:23:22.277
It's not that easy to find,
Barf. Besides, it stinks.

01:23:22.279 --> 01:23:24.880
Bigsnot, I command you.

01:23:24.882 --> 01:23:27.585
All right.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.121
How did I let myself
get into this mess?

01:23:33.123 --> 01:23:35.724
And why in the sea
do I listen to that little runt?

01:23:35.726 --> 01:23:38.794
That magical burp
really packs a punch.

01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:41.496
I even know
that what I'm doing is wrong,

01:23:41.498 --> 01:23:44.233
but I, I just can't stop myself.

01:23:45.636 --> 01:23:48.469
I'd give anything
to be back in my cave

01:23:48.471 --> 01:23:51.572
eating buckets of rotten fish

01:23:51.574 --> 01:23:54.710
and watching the larva roll by.

01:23:54.712 --> 01:23:56.815
Ah, maybe someday.

01:23:58.848 --> 01:24:03.120
We've got to be close, Mucus. Tiptoes
has to be around here, somewhere.

01:24:04.288 --> 01:24:09.323
Ah, I'm scared, Char. What if
he's mad we forced our way in?

01:24:09.325 --> 01:24:12.529
We didn't force our way anywhere.
We won a bet, fair and square.

01:24:17.501 --> 01:24:20.736
Trespassers!

01:24:22.839 --> 01:24:27.145
Why do you bother me,
little creatures?

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:33.348
We are, we are trying to save
our teacher, the Maestro.

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:36.518
He means more to us
than anything in the sea.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.252
Mucus, I must interrupt you.

01:24:38.254 --> 01:24:41.389
What are you doing, Char,
I'm telling the truth.

01:24:41.391 --> 01:24:44.660
But not the whole truth.
Mr. Tiptoes,

01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:47.662
it's true that we're trying to save
our kidnapped teacher, the Maestro.

01:24:47.664 --> 01:24:52.634
But whereas that's my friend's main
motivation, I have a different one.

01:24:52.636 --> 01:24:54.870
Go on.

01:24:54.872 --> 01:24:59.741
Oh, Mr. Tiptoes, I'm in love
with the Maestro's newest pupil

01:24:59.743 --> 01:25:04.278
who is out on a mission of her own
and I'm worried sick about her safety.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.381
Her name's Corallina,
and I think

01:25:07.383 --> 01:25:11.452
she's the most beautiful
sea monster I've ever seen.

01:25:11.454 --> 01:25:15.890
So, it's true I want to save our
teacher and friend more than anything,

01:25:15.892 --> 01:25:19.363
but I also want to show
Corallina how brave I am.

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:24.299
Wow, way to lay it all
out there, buddy.

01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:28.603
Your mission is a true one,
sea creature,

01:25:28.605 --> 01:25:31.939
and I commend you
on your honesty.

01:25:31.941 --> 01:25:35.743
Despite your care
and hardship, take heart.

01:25:35.745 --> 01:25:39.915
There comes a time
in every sea monster's life

01:25:39.917 --> 01:25:45.423
when he must realize his relationship
with honor and with love.

01:25:46.623 --> 01:25:51.993
And in those rarest instances
they are one and the same.

01:25:51.995 --> 01:25:55.529
And while I already
know you've come

01:25:55.531 --> 01:26:00.535
for the all-powerful vapor
of our Flatulating Lock,

01:26:00.537 --> 01:26:07.041
know this: the power you seek
is already within you.

01:26:07.043 --> 01:26:09.678
- It is?
- Wow.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.048
He says it's the flatulent
vapor's inside you, Char.

01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:15.651
Hey, is it in me too?

01:26:15.653 --> 01:26:21.423
We all come to the power
in our own time, creature.

01:26:21.425 --> 01:26:26.428
Some sooner, some later.

01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:30.599
So, is, is, is that a yes or...?

01:26:30.601 --> 01:26:33.238
Don't press our luck, Mucus.

01:26:34.637 --> 01:26:38.372
Forgive me, Master Tiptoes,
we've got an emergency.

01:26:38.374 --> 01:26:44.813
The monster Bigsnot has breached our borders
at a high speed of 14 knots and climbing.

01:26:44.815 --> 01:26:46.715
His arrival is imminent.

01:26:46.717 --> 01:26:49.384
Back in the hatches,
Googly-Brow.

01:26:49.386 --> 01:26:52.520
Everyone on full
flatulating alert.

01:26:52.522 --> 01:26:56.394
The beast mustn't
reach our center.

01:26:57.093 --> 01:27:01.632
- Excuse us, creatures, but duty calls.
- Understood.

01:27:05.836 --> 01:27:09.470
Why do you think Bigsnot
is here, Char?

01:27:09.472 --> 01:27:10.675
I don't know, Mucus.

01:27:12.043 --> 01:27:14.943
But I'll bet it's got something
to do with the all-powerful vapor.

01:27:14.945 --> 01:27:16.748
Oh boy.

01:27:18.781 --> 01:27:21.750
And now,
here I am in this smelly lock,

01:27:21.752 --> 01:27:25.586
putting myself in danger,
making a bunch of new enemies.

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:28.590
All for that
little monster, Barf.

01:27:28.592 --> 01:27:31.893
I swear, sometimes I wish
I'd been born a barnacle.

01:27:31.895 --> 01:27:34.062
No one even knows they're there.

01:27:34.064 --> 01:27:37.366
Maybe I can find a spell
that shrinks me down.

01:27:37.368 --> 01:27:40.004
I'm sick of being a sea monster.

01:27:42.373 --> 01:27:45.506
I know what Tiptoes said back
there, Mucus, but I just don't know

01:27:45.508 --> 01:27:47.979
if I can do this
without some kind of magic.

01:27:49.879 --> 01:27:55.015
But, Char, if you really meant what
you said about Corallina, you have to.

01:27:55.017 --> 01:27:58.053
Besides, this place reeks so bad

01:27:58.055 --> 01:28:02.060
I just want to get this over
with and get out of here.

01:28:05.395 --> 01:28:08.397
We have to find Wishbone
The Mighty fast, Squirtlips.

01:28:08.399 --> 01:28:12.067
There's no telling how the Maestro
is doing or even where he is.

01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:16.537
He could be Schmerk miles away on
the other side of the world by now.

01:28:16.539 --> 01:28:19.109
We've come this far,
Corallina, we'll find him.

01:28:25.516 --> 01:28:31.519
Eh, what's this? Hey, dinner?

01:28:31.521 --> 01:28:32.920
Certainly not.

01:28:32.922 --> 01:28:34.889
We're on a mission.

01:28:34.891 --> 01:28:37.091
Dinners don't go on missions.

01:28:37.093 --> 01:28:39.960
Forgive us for intruding,
Mr. Wishbone,

01:28:39.962 --> 01:28:43.465
but we're doing our level best to
rescue our teacher, the Maestro.

01:28:43.467 --> 01:28:46.568
And the only place we can do
that is in the Sea of Goo,

01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:50.639
where he's being held prisoner,
by that dastardly Great Gurglegut.

01:28:50.641 --> 01:28:55.844
The Maestro's still getting
himself in trouble, eh?

01:28:55.846 --> 01:28:58.712
Not surprising.

01:28:58.714 --> 01:29:02.216
However, I do like

01:29:02.218 --> 01:29:06.020
a little sea creature
who knows what she wants.

01:29:06.022 --> 01:29:09.858
I know what I want,
just not how to get it.

01:29:11.561 --> 01:29:14.496
Hm, if I may, Mr. Mighty,

01:29:14.498 --> 01:29:18.934
I understand the Great Gurglegut
recently stole your bones.

01:29:18.936 --> 01:29:20.868
Is that correct?

01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:26.675
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:29:26.677 --> 01:29:29.947
Well, let's say we make a deal.

01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:39.019
Grant us entry to the Sea of Goo,
and we'll get your bones back.

01:29:39.021 --> 01:29:42.193
You can do this,
little creatures?

01:29:43.092 --> 01:29:45.227
We can try.

01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:49.965
I didn't ask if you could try.

01:29:49.967 --> 01:29:53.068
I asked if you could do it.

01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:57.738
Yes, we can, Wishbone. Just get
us there, we won't let you down.

01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:59.840
Very well.

01:29:59.842 --> 01:30:03.978
You two are headed
for the Sea of Goo.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:09.984
And, little creatures,
don't disappoint me.

01:30:17.561 --> 01:30:21.563
Maestro, my plankton lookouts
have delivered news.

01:30:21.565 --> 01:30:26.568
Your students, Corallina
and some peculiar lippy thing.

01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:28.135
Squirtlips?

01:30:28.137 --> 01:30:32.107
If you say so.
They are here in the Sea of Goo.

01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:35.710
They are? But, but how did...

01:30:35.712 --> 01:30:39.548
I've no idea.
But they are headed our way.

01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:43.186
Aw, goodness gracious,
they're in danger.

01:30:45.689 --> 01:30:48.557
We've come a long way,
Gurglegut.

01:30:48.559 --> 01:30:54.763
I see that,
my dear little sea cuteness.

01:30:54.765 --> 01:30:57.866
And I thank you.

01:30:57.868 --> 01:31:01.870
We shall marry in haste.

01:31:01.872 --> 01:31:06.907
Marry? You must have me
confused with someone else.

01:31:06.909 --> 01:31:10.344
I definitely do not, Corallina.

01:31:10.346 --> 01:31:13.682
We shall marry at once

01:31:13.684 --> 01:31:19.987
and you will rule
the Sea of Goo with me.

01:31:19.989 --> 01:31:22.890
How does that sound?

01:31:22.892 --> 01:31:25.794
You've gone sea bananas.

01:31:25.796 --> 01:31:32.600
Bananas about you, my super cute
little sea monster.

01:31:32.602 --> 01:31:38.005
Now, why don't we just say,
"I do"?

01:31:38.007 --> 01:31:42.978
Why don't you release the Maestro and
forget this whole crazy scheme of yours?

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:48.750
Because that would defy
my deal with Barf, of course.

01:31:48.752 --> 01:31:50.318
Your deal?

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:54.022
Yes. The Maestro for you,

01:31:54.024 --> 01:31:59.327
my adorable future bubbly bride.

01:31:59.329 --> 01:32:00.862
Bah!

01:32:00.864 --> 01:32:02.997
Easier said than done,
you beast.

01:32:02.999 --> 01:32:05.800
I have burping powers of my own.

01:32:05.802 --> 01:32:11.406
Ooh, I'd love to hear them,

01:32:11.408 --> 01:32:15.743
my adored little sea bubble.

01:32:15.745 --> 01:32:17.679
Oh, yeah? And how would you like

01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:20.618
to live out the rest
of your days as a jelly squid?

01:32:30.894 --> 01:32:35.929
I don't get it.
Should something have happened?

01:32:35.931 --> 01:32:38.034
Hum. Not sure.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:48.745
Charlie, help!

01:33:00.457 --> 01:33:03.124
What just happened?

01:33:03.126 --> 01:33:04.693
I'm not sure.

01:33:04.695 --> 01:33:05.960
Whoa!

01:33:05.962 --> 01:33:09.330
Oh, all of a sudden, I, I feel

01:33:09.332 --> 01:33:14.805
as if I must obey your every
command, my master monster fish.

01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:22.777
Enough fighting,
my little monstrous sea bubble.

01:33:22.779 --> 01:33:25.112
Oh, let's get hitched.

01:33:25.114 --> 01:33:28.183
Let us rule the Sea of Goo

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:33.087
as the monster and his bride.

01:33:33.089 --> 01:33:35.924
Corallina, no!

01:33:35.926 --> 01:33:39.393
Never. I'll never marry you.
Take this.

01:33:44.801 --> 01:33:49.073
Whoa, that, that look suits you,
Gurglegut.

01:33:58.781 --> 01:34:01.049
- Corallina.
- Hi, Maestro.

01:34:01.051 --> 01:34:05.286
Oh, my dear. How in this sea
did you ever get...

01:34:05.288 --> 01:34:07.855
I found my burping power,
Maestro.

01:34:07.857 --> 01:34:10.892
The strength
that was inside me all along.

01:34:10.894 --> 01:34:17.098
Corallina, I knew your mother
and I'm proud to know you.

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:22.303
Well, I've never seen
such power in all my days.

01:34:22.305 --> 01:34:24.339
I have you to thank, Maestro.

01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:28.475
You made me see that it's possible.
That no matter who my mother is

01:34:28.477 --> 01:34:32.412
or what my dreams are, all I
have to do is believe in myself.

01:34:32.414 --> 01:34:36.251
You're quite the sea monster,
Corallina.

01:34:36.253 --> 01:34:39.957
Quite the monster indeed.

01:34:44.093 --> 01:34:46.094
Barf will never see this coming.

01:34:46.096 --> 01:34:49.063
With you on our side, Bigsnot,
we can thwart that little runt

01:34:49.065 --> 01:34:51.899
and his crazy plans
once and for all.

01:34:51.901 --> 01:34:55.303
I appreciate the sentiment,
guys, I really do,

01:34:55.305 --> 01:34:59.407
but, uh, I just hoped
to relax and dig

01:34:59.409 --> 01:35:03.077
into a nice big bucket of rotten
fish after all this is over.

01:35:03.079 --> 01:35:07.816
But if we pull this off, Bigsnot,
we'll get you two buckets.

01:35:07.818 --> 01:35:09.951
And, and maybe one for me?

01:35:09.953 --> 01:35:13.388
All this talk of food
is making me hungry.

01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:15.359
Deal, Mucus.

01:35:27.037 --> 01:35:30.470
Welcome back, sea monsters.

01:35:30.472 --> 01:35:34.876
Maestro, it's good
to see you again.

01:35:34.878 --> 01:35:36.844
Thanks, Wishbone.

01:35:36.846 --> 01:35:40.615
And thanks for allowing
my apprising students here

01:35:40.617 --> 01:35:46.422
to pass through your territory
on their way to save my scales.

01:35:47.356 --> 01:35:50.191
Anytime, Maestro.

01:35:50.193 --> 01:35:55.129
And I must thank you
for returning my stolen bones

01:35:55.131 --> 01:35:56.867
as you promised.

01:35:57.566 --> 01:35:59.634
You're welcome indeed.

01:35:59.636 --> 01:36:02.636
Oh, ho-ho, brave sea monsters,

01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:08.376
accept my eternal gratitude.

01:36:08.378 --> 01:36:10.444
No need, we made a deal.

01:36:10.446 --> 01:36:13.046
You granted this passage
and we found your bones.

01:36:13.048 --> 01:36:15.183
We're happy to be of service.

01:36:15.185 --> 01:36:20.188
Well, it looks like
we all win today.

01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:24.461
And now,
I'd like to ask you a favor.

01:36:28.198 --> 01:36:33.367
You returned my most
prized possessions to me,

01:36:33.369 --> 01:36:39.072
and I understand you have
a big contest coming up.

01:36:39.074 --> 01:36:44.312
Corallina, I'd like
to ask your permission

01:36:44.314 --> 01:36:48.582
to attend and cheer you on.

01:36:48.584 --> 01:36:53.254
Well, I mean, I'm competing
in the contest too, you know.

01:36:54.958 --> 01:36:57.925
Well, Squirtlips.

01:36:57.927 --> 01:37:01.562
We'd be honored
to have you, Wishbone.

01:37:01.564 --> 01:37:03.133
Absolutely.

01:37:06.503 --> 01:37:10.004
Hey, where'd Bigsnot go?

01:37:10.006 --> 01:37:13.644
Huh? That's strange.
I don't know.

01:37:19.615 --> 01:37:22.149
Well, well, well.

01:37:22.151 --> 01:37:24.952
Thought you could subvert
the Great and Magical Burp

01:37:24.954 --> 01:37:28.555
with silly magic
of your own, eh?

01:37:28.557 --> 01:37:32.460
Give it up, Barf. You'll never
win. Bigsnot, tell him.

01:37:33.696 --> 01:37:37.064
You are mistaken, Charlie.

01:37:37.066 --> 01:37:41.202
Barf and I run
the Sea of Schmerk now.

01:37:41.204 --> 01:37:45.605
Oh no, Char, Bigsnot's back
under Barf's spell.

01:37:45.607 --> 01:37:48.242
That's right, twits.

01:37:48.244 --> 01:37:51.511
Now, you're gonna
pay the price for crossing Barf.

01:37:51.513 --> 01:37:55.118
You'll wish you were
in an aquarium after I'm done.

01:38:08.765 --> 01:38:12.000
Eh, eh, see?

01:38:12.002 --> 01:38:17.341
Ooh. What happened?
Hey, where is Barf?

01:38:28.584 --> 01:38:32.319
I'm so glad you guys are okay, and
it's great to see you again, Maestro.

01:38:32.321 --> 01:38:35.089
You did it, Corallina.
You're a hero.

01:38:35.091 --> 01:38:36.758
We did it, Charlie.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.794
Yeah. We may have
rescued the Maestro

01:38:39.796 --> 01:38:42.162
but you defeated Barf.

01:38:42.164 --> 01:38:44.331
Yeah, I, I guess that's fair.

01:38:44.333 --> 01:38:48.568
It's more than fair, Charlie.
Today we're all heroes.

01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:53.273
She's right, Charlie.
Without the help of all of you

01:38:53.275 --> 01:38:56.077
I might have been lost forever.

01:38:56.079 --> 01:38:59.479
My soul pupils.

01:39:02.252 --> 01:39:04.989
Guys, I have
an announcement to make.

01:39:07.423 --> 01:39:11.761
After much thought, I've decided to
drop out of the Burping Monster Contest.

01:39:15.498 --> 01:39:19.332
But why, Charlie?

01:39:19.334 --> 01:39:23.203
Because Corallina
deserves to win.

01:39:23.205 --> 01:39:26.506
And I don't want
another championship title.

01:39:26.508 --> 01:39:30.077
I want your heart, Corallina.

01:39:30.079 --> 01:39:31.645
I love you.

01:39:31.647 --> 01:39:35.550
Oh, Charlie, I love you too.

01:39:35.552 --> 01:39:37.588
What am I? Chopped tuna?

01:39:47.262 --> 01:39:51.334
- What the...
- Hey there, trespasser.

01:39:54.369 --> 01:39:56.804
Watch your lips, bottom feeder.

01:39:56.806 --> 01:39:59.439
I was hit by
the all-powerful vapor.

01:39:59.441 --> 01:40:03.877
And just as soon as I regain
my senses, I'll get out of here.

01:40:03.879 --> 01:40:10.751
Uh-huh? The key phrase there,
pukey ism get out of here.

01:40:10.753 --> 01:40:12.620
And if you want to,

01:40:12.622 --> 01:40:16.224
you'll have to solve
a little riddle

01:40:16.226 --> 01:40:17.294
first.

01:40:18.227 --> 01:40:20.594
And if I refuse?

01:40:20.596 --> 01:40:24.131
You'll spend
the rest of your days

01:40:24.133 --> 01:40:27.801
in this place with me.

01:40:27.803 --> 01:40:31.339
Ha. I can get out of here
in a spore second.

01:40:31.341 --> 01:40:32.807
Have it your way.

01:40:32.809 --> 01:40:35.408
I'm going to hang right here

01:40:35.410 --> 01:40:38.312
and watch the show.

01:40:42.784 --> 01:40:47.455
Hey! Wa, wa, wait just
a Schmerk minute here.

01:40:47.457 --> 01:40:50.494
Where am I? Uh, uh...
How do I get out of here?

01:41:06.575 --> 01:41:09.943
Welcome,
vertebrates and invertebrates.

01:41:09.945 --> 01:41:15.448
One and all to the long awaited
Monster Burping Contest.

01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:20.353
Remember, your cheers can put a
competitor over the top tonight.

01:41:20.355 --> 01:41:23.558
So, don't hold back.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:27.627
Without further ado,
this year's contestants:

01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:34.468
First up, Squirtlips.

01:41:48.952 --> 01:41:54.290
Woo-hoo.

01:42:07.003 --> 01:42:13.674
Next, give a warm contest
welcome to Mucus.

01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:31.461
Yippy.

01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:39.934
Do we
have a contender.

01:42:39.936 --> 01:42:43.536
And now, last but not least,

01:42:43.538 --> 01:42:46.506
give it up for Maestro's
newest <i>protégé,</i>

01:42:46.508 --> 01:42:50.745
the lovely Corallina.

01:43:06.561 --> 01:43:11.365
My swordfish,
throw a shrimp on the Barbie.

01:43:11.367 --> 01:43:16.839
That was utterly unbelievable.

01:43:21.577 --> 01:43:24.778
And our winner

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.919
and new Burping
Monster Champion of the sea is

01:43:34.489 --> 01:43:37.992
Corallina!
