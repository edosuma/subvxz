WEBVTT

00:07.632 --> 00:09.551
Da Vinci experimented
with vibrations.

00:09.592 --> 00:12.012
A dagger touched by the heavens.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.722
Previously on
The Lost Symbol...

00:13.763 --> 00:15.724
We got to figure out
what Blake's been up to.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.892
He's been on the phone
with Istanbul.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.562
A long-range
antipersonnel technology.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.439
He could wipe out our accounts.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.065
All those in favor

00:24.107 --> 00:25.567
of turning the device over?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.402
I'm his mother.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.571
-You're my mother, too.
-Then you need to leave.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.489
He's hidden something
in the barn.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.658
My boy.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.089
-Hey.
-Hey, are you there yet?

01:29.130 --> 01:30.548
I still got a half hour left.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.842
Some bridge closed,
and I got rerouted.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.650
She's still not answering.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.110
You said she never answers.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.570
Yeah, uh, I did. I did say that.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.502
Call me when you get there,
and be careful.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.797
-Will do.
-Okay. Bye.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.760
This muffle furnace tops out
at 1,400 degrees Celsius.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.595
Hot enough to turn anything
to dust.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.014
Including the pyramid,
whatever it's made of.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.392
What? W-Wait a minute.
That would destroy it.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.436
-Exactly.
-I thought we were here
to do X-rays on it

03:48.478 --> 03:50.146
or run it through
the mass spectrometer.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.899
No. I'm done.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.401
He's done.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.612
We are going to stop him
by obliterating the path

03:57.654 --> 04:00.615
to the only thing
he seems to care about.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.703
What about what you care about?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.541
Since this started,
you've been talking

04:09.582 --> 04:11.167
about the wisdom
as if it was real.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.294
I mean, God, l-look around.
Everything you've built.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.714
If this could, on some level,
validate your theories,

04:15.755 --> 04:17.549
then wouldn't you want to know?

04:19.843 --> 04:21.678
You need to get
your own material.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.054
What?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.764
I used that line on Warren
to get him to help us.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.559
Okay. Regardless,
uh, the point is...

04:27.600 --> 04:29.019
The point is,
this isn't about me.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.980
Admit it, it's you.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.565
You've changed.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.859
Now you're the one
who needs to know.

04:38.945 --> 04:43.074
I-I study history,
I don't destroy it.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.661
S-Sure, if there's something
buried out there,

04:46.703 --> 04:50.832
a-an ancient instruction manual,
a psychic lesson plan,

04:50.874 --> 04:54.002
h-however is it that this wisdom
actually, tangibly presents,

04:54.044 --> 04:55.962
then, yeah,
I-I would like to see it.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.007
So this is purely
an academic pursuit for you.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.675
Basically, yeah.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.802
Then you'll get over it.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.766
-Your dad's gonna be here soon.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.562
He's got ten minutes.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.750
What?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.253
Oh, no, it was nothing.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.963
What?

06:20.005 --> 06:22.215
I was just thinking
this isn't the type

06:22.257 --> 06:27.137
of "morning after" ritual
couples usually engage in.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.638
"Couples"?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.641
Oh, you know what I mean.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.981
We could not talk about it,
if...

06:38.023 --> 06:40.275
I mean, maybe not,
like, right now.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.110
Yeah, exactly. With-- Yeah.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.196
Whenever. Or not, even.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.364
Uh...

06:51.244 --> 06:52.746
Dad...

06:52.787 --> 06:54.914
I don't understand.
It was at your mother's?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.459
-He hid it there.
-What?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.461
Dad.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.505
Mom knew he was alive.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.800
She's the one who's been
giving him money.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.970
She's... she's known all along.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.639
That can't be.
She would never...

07:11.681 --> 07:13.141
He's been manipulating her,

07:13.183 --> 07:15.143
and she doesn't understand
what he's become.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.357
So now, we are going
to destroy that pyramid,

07:20.398 --> 07:22.817
and end this once and for all.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.362
No.

07:25.403 --> 07:29.532
I fear his plan is far
more complex than we knew.

07:33.536 --> 07:37.123
He has something.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.848
So you handed over
this device to him.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.558
-I was outvoted.
-Outvoted.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.642
From what you've told us,
this thing

10:42.684 --> 10:44.352
could cause serious damage.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.813
And if that comes to pass, I
will be forced to live with it.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.898
I think there may be
another reason he wants it.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.026
A device that creates
vibrations,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.694
I have to believe
it's about resonance.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.113
Exactly. He was writing
about it in his journals.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
-PETER: Yes.
-Vibrational phenomena,

10:57.032 --> 10:58.533
cymatics, how sound can
create patterns and...

10:58.575 --> 10:59.826
And symbols.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.703
The Leviathan Cross,
the circumpunct.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.371
Symbols have been
opening doors all along.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.082
It makes sense that the final
door would be the same.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.129
It's Nuñez.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.089
Hey, you there yet?

11:20.055 --> 11:21.431
Yeah.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.602
Yeah, okay.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.355
What's going on?
Did he talk to your mom?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.440
No, he never made it.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.568
He saw...

11:33.610 --> 11:36.988
Zach testing
the device, I think.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.782
And it did something to him,
to Nuñez.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.992
He was bleeding from his ears
and he blacked out.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.119
-Is he all right?
-He says he is. I don't know.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.632
We can't destroy
the pyramid now,

11:55.674 --> 11:57.133
it gives him nothing to lose.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.512
So what do we do next?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.180
We get there first.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.599
We find the ancient wisdom.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.101
That is the way we stop him.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.268
He's right.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.728
Langdon, you have been
trying to find it.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.230
Over and over again.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.607
Never with the three
of us together.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.568
Okay.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.988
What was the last clue
you guys figured out?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.699
It was a pseudonym.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.242
Uh, Isaacus Neutonuus.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.619
-Newton. He was a Freemason?
-PETER: A Rosicrucian.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.162
An alchemist.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.249
Alchemy.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.132
You said there was a clue
about the 33rd degree?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.676
"All will be revealed
at the 33rd degree."

12:39.718 --> 12:41.970
We used my 33rd degree ring
to open the box

12:42.012 --> 12:43.722
that revealed the Rose cross.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.516
What if there's another meaning?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.560
Temperature, on an older scale.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.061
Not Fahrenheit or Celsius.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.896
-The Newton scale.
-And on the Newtonian scale,

12:51.938 --> 12:53.481
the boiling point of water,
which is the quintessential

12:53.523 --> 12:55.442
alchemical process, occurs at...

12:55.483 --> 12:58.862
33 degrees. Brilliant.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.031
It's telling us to boil it.

13:20.383 --> 13:24.137
Look, the capstone.
Something's happening.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.852
"Eight Franklin Square."

13:30.894 --> 13:34.272
The pyramid has its alchemy,
and we three, it appears,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.691
have our own.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.693
Let's look up the address.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.260
I think I know how to end this.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.015
So, your son's
gone from kidnapper

14:09.057 --> 14:11.768
to murderer
to domestic terrorist.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.604
And now, thanks
to this Leviathan group,

14:14.646 --> 14:16.940
he has classified
government technology.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.733
So you understand, Mr. Solomon,

14:18.775 --> 14:20.860
every one of your members will
be held accountable for this.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.487
-Even you.
-PETER: So be it.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.698
But right now, I am just here
to help you apprehend

14:24.739 --> 14:26.700
-the real threat.
-TOWNSEND: Don't take this
the wrong way,

14:26.741 --> 14:29.577
but you don't look like you're
in a position to help anyone.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.122
I assume you know
why he's doing this.

14:32.163 --> 14:35.750
The portal. It's been a topic
of curiosity here for years.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.003
Never put any stock in it,
personally.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.546
Others have developed
a bit of a fetish.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.631
It doesn't matter
if you think it's real.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.133
-Mal'akh does.
-And how is it

14:43.174 --> 14:45.093
you're going
to help us catch him?

14:47.762 --> 14:50.640
They figured out where it is.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.270
We'll give you the location.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.648
You'll use it to lure him
and, uh, take him out.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.192
Okay. Where is it?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.445
-KATHERINE: We have a condition.
-Hmm?

15:03.486 --> 15:07.073
If we unearth this wisdom,
whatever form it takes,

15:07.115 --> 15:08.992
-we share it.
-With whom?

15:09.034 --> 15:10.744
-Everyone.
-PETER: We go public.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.203
Demystify it.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.122
You'd be acting
against your sacred oath.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.375
If we make it public,
then no one will ever again

15:17.417 --> 15:20.003
mount such a destructive mission
to find it.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.381
If you truly believe
there's a power in this wisdom,

15:23.423 --> 15:26.051
what's to prevent others
using it for evil?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.553
I have to believe
that, in the end,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.764
the good in us will triumph.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.724
You're being naïve.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.476
-Deal.
-Charlene.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.769
Oh, let's face it, Ellison,

15:35.810 --> 15:37.270
you've become
obsessed with this.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.855
In some ways you're no better
than this Mal'akh.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.273
I need to focus
on what's real here,

15:40.315 --> 15:42.484
and in this case,
it's eliminating the threat.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.362
So how do we tip him off
about the location?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.238
Don't suppose
you have his number?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.823
No.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.867
But he has ours.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.669
Sounds nice.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.379
Kind of like a cosmic cowbell.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.549
This is
the vibration written of

16:06.591 --> 16:08.551
in the Vedic Brahmanas.

16:08.593 --> 16:11.721
The frequency of creation.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.475
That'll work, too.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.105
Okay. The frequency
is locked and loaded.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.941
Chatter on the network.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.867
The Almas Temple.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.286
8 Franklin Square.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.374
Where are you going?

16:39.416 --> 16:41.292
To end it.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.021
Hero 1 to Sandman,
what is your status?

17:01.062 --> 17:03.565
Sandman Actual,
in position and ready.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.692
Copy.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.028
Langley?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.989
Langley sees you.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.699
Now we wait.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.631
Can't even see
the temple from here.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.718
Safer that way. Just be patient.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.680
Do you think
he's even gonna show?

17:35.722 --> 17:39.392
How would I know?
It's your plan.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.821
Hey. You okay?

17:54.074 --> 17:58.578
Do you think, if they catch him,
we'll be allowed to see him?

17:58.620 --> 18:01.706
I have no idea.
Would you want to?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.501
I feel like I owe it to him,

18:04.542 --> 18:06.336
maybe to myself,

18:06.378 --> 18:09.923
just to see if there's any
of him left in there, you know?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.385
God, is that crazy?

18:13.426 --> 18:16.179
No. It's not crazy.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.691
I might have something.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.908
Possible target,
heading up the temple steps.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.914
Sandman Actual.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.958
I have eyes on the target.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.921
It's him.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.673
-Weapons hot.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.852
Go on my signal.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.275
Go.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.237
Get down!

19:33.340 --> 19:35.175
Sandman Actual to Hero 1.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.885
Target secure.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.595
Nice work.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.180
Let's get him to his new home.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.768
You're welcome.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.982
Understood.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.609
They got him.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.077
-Y-You're sure?
-I'm sure. This is what we do.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.538
Oh, my God.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.999
What are you doing?

20:08.041 --> 20:10.043
-Calling Sato.
-No calls.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.294
Give it to me.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.093
I'm not giving you my phone.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.138
Hand it over.

20:26.142 --> 20:29.270
Wow. So that's the state of
civil liberties in this country.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.690
You know, I don't even know
why I'm surprised.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.400
Just following orders.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.693
What orders?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.027
We're supposed to be
partners on this.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.696
Is there something
you're not telling us?

20:43.159 --> 20:44.661
Site's secure.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.664
-We can bring them in.
-Who?

20:47.706 --> 20:50.417
Langdon. The Solomons.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.711
That's no longer happening.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.262
What the hell is going on?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.731
Who's that?

21:15.817 --> 21:17.068
Is that...

21:17.110 --> 21:19.821
Benjamin York.
You know him as Samyaza.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.573
What the hell is he doing here?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.242
Blake tracked him down
off the intel you collected.

21:24.284 --> 21:28.121
Found him in a Chechen prison.
Real shithole.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.262
Clear the room.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.638
Yes, sir.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.584
You're making a mistake.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.545
You must have known that
we'd want first crack at this.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.631
And if there's wisdom
in the temple, Mr. York

22:19.673 --> 22:21.424
is going to help us find it.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.293
It's not here.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.891
Anything down there?

23:11.933 --> 23:13.810
The foundation
is on solid bedrock.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.437
Nothing is buried here.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.105
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

23:17.147 --> 23:20.066
I saw the capstone
with my own damn eyes.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.861
It said "Eight Franklin Square."

23:34.122 --> 23:36.207
Briggs, put Langdon on.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.129
-Briggs?
-NUÑEZ Sorry.

23:41.171 --> 23:43.673
Briggs can't come
to the phone right now.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.051
Who the hell is this?

23:49.888 --> 23:51.306
They played you.

23:54.184 --> 23:57.312
"Eight Franklin Square."

23:57.354 --> 23:59.981
The pyramid has
its alchemy, and we three,

24:00.023 --> 24:02.400
it appears, have our own.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.028
Let's look up the address.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.000
I think I know how to end this.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.836
Here, look at this.

24:29.552 --> 24:35.183
There was some kind of wax
hiding this grid.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.523
Here, I'll-I'll draw it.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.818
No, no, um, I have
a better idea. Hang on.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.910
It's a blend

24:53.952 --> 24:57.539
of astrological, Masonic
and alchemical symbols,

24:57.580 --> 25:00.917
all of which seem to connect
to the ancient mysteries.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.877
It's an eight by eight grid.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.254
Franklin Square.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.547
The secret hides
within the Order.

25:05.588 --> 25:06.881
It's not a religious order.

25:06.923 --> 25:09.467
It's the "Order Eight
Franklin Square."

25:09.509 --> 25:11.720
-Which is what?
-It's a magic square.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.096
Just like
in the Dürer engraving.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.056
But created by Ben Franklin.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.808
The secret hides

25:16.850 --> 25:19.978
within the Order Eight

25:20.020 --> 25:22.772
Franklin Square.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.777
So we arrange these symbols

25:27.819 --> 25:28.945
according to these
numbers, right?

25:28.987 --> 25:31.281
-Yeah, exactly.
-Great, hang on.

25:32.657 --> 25:35.535
Masons and their math, huh?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.662
Well, math is the language
in which God wrote the universe.

25:37.704 --> 25:38.872
If you go by the Bible,

25:38.913 --> 25:41.166
His math is pretty bad,
actually.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.216
All right.

25:50.258 --> 25:53.261
-Done.
-So, what do you see?

25:53.303 --> 25:54.304
A pictogram.

25:54.346 --> 25:56.014
-An allegory.
-PETER: That's all,

25:56.056 --> 25:57.349
from the symbologist?

25:58.808 --> 26:03.271
I'd interpret it as a picture
of heaven and Earth.

26:03.313 --> 26:07.108
Heredom, the holy house sitting
above the visible planets.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.402
Moon, Sun, the circumpunct,

26:09.444 --> 26:12.364
also the universal symbol
for God.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.033
The arrow pointing down
indicates

26:15.075 --> 26:17.702
that it is above Earth,

26:17.744 --> 26:19.287
where we see,

26:19.329 --> 26:22.457
filled with the representations
of modern religion,

26:22.499 --> 26:25.377
a pyramid stretching
toward heaven,

26:25.418 --> 26:27.671
the enduring symbol
of lost wisdom.

26:27.712 --> 26:31.675
And below that, the Winding
Staircase of Freemasonry.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.051
Very good.

26:33.093 --> 26:34.636
But we have to look
beyond the allegory

26:34.678 --> 26:36.012
to get a location.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.640
Right. It's a map. Of course.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.642
There are two spaces
on the third line.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.894
Is that deliberate
or are there symbols missing?

26:42.936 --> 26:45.188
Could be.
Uh, "Au" from the Latin aurum.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.481
The symbol for gold.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.400
Sigma, delta.
Sum and difference.

26:48.441 --> 26:51.027
And that E is one of the
alchemical symbols for mercury.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.570
So it's describing
the alchemical process,

26:52.612 --> 26:54.781
-but how does that help us?
-Yeah, I have no idea.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.533
The symbols that are missing
could be telling us

26:56.574 --> 26:58.827
where to look,
or maybe how to look.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.329
Heredom, a holy house, yes,

27:01.371 --> 27:04.374
but what is missing
is that it is also the code name

27:04.416 --> 27:08.003
that we use
for our grandest building,

27:08.044 --> 27:11.131
the House of the Temple.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.174
So,

27:13.216 --> 27:15.885
8 Franklin Square
isn't the right address.

27:15.927 --> 27:17.887
We know that,
but Mal'akh doesn't.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.681
-So we can use that to trap him.
-Yeah.

27:19.723 --> 27:22.642
And we're gonna need
Sato's help to do it.

27:24.644 --> 27:28.606
We realized this address,
it points to the Almas Temple.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.484
If Mal'akh is led to believe
that's where the portal is,

27:31.526 --> 27:33.278
he'll come for it.

27:33.319 --> 27:37.657
We have your people waiting,
and this time, we do it right.

27:38.658 --> 27:42.495
If it's there,
Blake won't let you near it.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.750
It won't be.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.835
There's another location.

27:48.877 --> 27:52.130
It's probably best
you don't know where it is.

27:53.465 --> 27:56.426
As for Blake,
we need to go over his head.

27:56.468 --> 27:59.512
Can you get us in
to see the director?

28:09.022 --> 28:10.482
We'll give you the location.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.693
You'll use it to lure him
and, uh, take him out.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.278
-Deal.
-Go.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.574
They got him.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.327
Hand it over.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.262
Stay put.

28:48.478 --> 28:51.189
Hey, what's going on, Officer?

28:51.231 --> 28:53.566
Got a complaint
of a Peeping Tom.

28:53.608 --> 28:54.984
You look like a Tom.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.445
I'm with the management company.

28:57.487 --> 28:58.530
You got ID?

29:02.158 --> 29:04.452
Check my pocket. I'm CIA.

29:04.494 --> 29:07.163
Yeah, I know. Now don't move.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.333
-LANGDON: We good?
-Yep.

29:10.375 --> 29:13.461
-What do you think you're doing?
-Shut up, Tom.

29:13.503 --> 29:14.921
Figure you got about 15 minutes

29:14.963 --> 29:17.298
till the rest of the CIA
gets wise.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.761
Don't worry about me. Go.

29:48.872 --> 29:51.833
There she is.
House of the Temple.

29:51.875 --> 29:54.627
Modeled on the great tomb
of King Mausolus

29:54.669 --> 29:56.212
-at Halic...
-KATHERINE: Halicarnassus.

29:56.254 --> 29:58.256
One of the Seven Wonders
of the Ancient World.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.759
Literally, every time
we drive past it.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.385
Do we just knock
on the front door?

30:02.427 --> 30:05.221
Pull around the north side.
I have a way in.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.645
Guess they haven't revoked
your access code.

30:12.687 --> 30:16.775
Leviathans be damned.
I'm still a Master Mason.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.736
They can't take that from me.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.529
Follow me.

30:39.547 --> 30:41.091
This must be the Temple Room.

30:41.132 --> 30:43.968
The beating heart of Heredom.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.012
This is where
33rd degree Masons

30:46.054 --> 30:48.181
hold our most sacred rituals.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.477
Incredible.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.525
There's nothing
at the Almas Temple.

30:58.566 --> 31:02.570
So either Langdon got it wrong,
or he duped us.

31:02.612 --> 31:04.531
Thoughts?

31:09.703 --> 31:14.666
Like I said: you had to know
we wanted first crack.

31:14.708 --> 31:16.334
So I guess you did.

31:16.376 --> 31:19.129
I don't know whether to have you
renditioned or buy you a beer.

31:20.964 --> 31:23.508
Where's the actual location?

31:23.550 --> 31:25.051
He didn't tell me.

31:25.093 --> 31:27.262
He knew you'd ask me that,

31:27.303 --> 31:29.139
and he knew
I'd have to tell you.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.057
So you let Langdon
keep you in the dark?

31:31.099 --> 31:33.059
-I trust him.
-Trust?

31:33.101 --> 31:36.229
Yeah. You should try it
some time.

31:52.328 --> 31:55.331
Listen up. The tranqs
will be wearing off by now.

31:55.373 --> 31:57.459
-Don't take any chances.
-Copy.

32:10.388 --> 32:12.307
Oh, shit.

32:15.226 --> 32:17.645
Now look up.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.609
It's the inside of a pyramid.

32:24.152 --> 32:26.613
And we're directly
underneath it.

32:27.530 --> 32:30.283
Stairway out the front,
pyramid above,

32:30.325 --> 32:34.204
and the eye of God looking down.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.663
It could be here.

32:37.624 --> 32:39.167
Where?

32:47.926 --> 32:50.095
"From the light

32:50.136 --> 32:53.014
of the divine word,
the Logos..."

32:53.056 --> 32:54.557
"Comes the wisdom of Life."

32:54.599 --> 32:56.685
Well, I've never seen
a portal to godhood before,

32:56.726 --> 32:58.269
but I'm gonna take a wild stab
and say it's the giant altar

32:58.311 --> 32:59.646
in the middle of the room.

32:59.688 --> 33:01.940
The altar,
symbolic of the Masons' quest

33:01.981 --> 33:04.401
to commune with the Creator.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.277
Dad, does it open somehow?

33:06.319 --> 33:08.238
It's solid marble.

33:08.279 --> 33:09.989
Well, maybe it's under
the altar, then?

33:10.031 --> 33:12.158
No. This isn't right.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.743
Here? The altar?

33:13.785 --> 33:16.705
It's too easy.
We're missing something.

33:16.746 --> 33:18.498
Show me the grid.

33:23.461 --> 33:25.797
There. To the right of Heredom.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.341
What's that symbol?

33:28.383 --> 33:30.427
-KATHERINE: A down arrow.
-I don't think so.

33:30.468 --> 33:31.928
I was wrong.
It's-it's not an arrow

33:31.970 --> 33:36.141
pointing down, it's...
it's a sword pointing up.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.684
So now we're looking
for a sword?

33:37.726 --> 33:39.853
And not just any sword.
The Tyler sword.

33:39.894 --> 33:41.271
The Tyler sword.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.189
It's kept it in a display case
downstairs,

33:43.231 --> 33:45.108
but that is just a replica.

33:45.150 --> 33:49.362
The real one
is behind that throne.

34:10.633 --> 34:13.386
Look. On the hilt,
a Mason's square.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.347
What about the other side?

34:16.848 --> 34:18.058
An ouroboros.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.559
It's another Masonic symbol.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.519
Yes, but no.
They don't belong together.

34:21.561 --> 34:23.396
The square is normally paired
with the compass.

34:23.438 --> 34:24.898
So maybe these are
our missing symbols, then.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.900
Possibly, yes.

34:26.941 --> 34:28.276
Pen.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.450
What's the order, though?

34:36.242 --> 34:38.453
The Square is an L.

34:46.086 --> 34:47.504
Laus Deo.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.298
-"Praise be to God."
-The map is complete.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.593
This tells us
the final location.

34:55.303 --> 34:59.349
A staircase under a pyramid,

34:59.391 --> 35:01.685
inside an Egyptian obelisk

35:01.726 --> 35:05.772
rising 555 feet above the city.

35:08.942 --> 35:10.402
Security guard.

35:10.443 --> 35:13.613
Stay here. I'll deal with this.

35:18.493 --> 35:21.413
Good evening. Would you mind?

35:21.454 --> 35:23.790
Oh, Mr. Solomon.
Didn't recognize you.

35:23.832 --> 35:26.209
I know, I-I've lost
a bit of weight recently.

35:26.251 --> 35:27.544
You shouldn't have come here.

35:27.585 --> 35:29.295
I'm sorry, I know
it's after hours.

35:29.337 --> 35:32.173
No, there's a federal alert
out on you.

35:32.215 --> 35:33.425
I'm going to have
to detain you, sir.

35:33.466 --> 35:35.093
You're joking, right?

35:35.135 --> 35:36.428
Is there anyone else with you?

35:36.469 --> 35:38.138
-I heard voices.
-No. No, no, I'm sorry.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.639
I was praying.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.808
Come on, l-let's get this
sorted out, shall we?

35:41.850 --> 35:43.810
Thank you
for understanding, sir.

35:43.852 --> 35:45.437
That's quite all right.

35:48.690 --> 35:52.986
"Laus Deo" is inscribed
on the pyramidion

35:53.028 --> 35:56.197
atop the Washington Monument.

35:56.239 --> 35:58.825
That's where we need to go.

35:59.826 --> 36:02.162
So it all comes back
to George Washington.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.622
Full circle.

36:04.664 --> 36:07.334
The father of Freemasonry
in America,

36:07.375 --> 36:10.003
and they buried the wisdom
under the monument

36:10.045 --> 36:11.921
that immortalizes his memory.

36:13.798 --> 36:15.383
We're so close.

36:27.687 --> 36:29.898
Okay.

36:31.816 --> 36:35.987
Maybe it isn't just
an academic pursuit.

36:37.655 --> 36:39.491
I know.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.961
I'm gonna go check on your dad.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.330
Langdon?

38:23.011 --> 38:23.136
Hey, sis.
