WEBVTT

00:07.396 --> 00:08.739
What time is it, Charlie?

00:12.735 --> 00:14.045
You stole my watch?

00:14.069 --> 00:16.506
I found it in my
medicine cabinet.

00:16.530 --> 00:18.967
Let's try to keep these
little clues to a minimum

00:18.991 --> 00:19.884
while my mom's in town.

00:19.908 --> 00:22.011
She's an old-fashioned girl.

00:22.035 --> 00:24.514
Oh, and I made a reservation for
dinner tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.,

00:24.538 --> 00:25.682
just the three of us.

00:25.706 --> 00:28.727
Tomorrow? I can't. I
told you I couldn't.

00:28.751 --> 00:30.854
- No, you didn't. -Yes, I
told you a while ago.

00:30.878 --> 00:32.731
I've got these old
friends, Mike and Rebecca.

00:32.755 --> 00:35.358
They're in town for a couple
of days visiting her folks.

00:35.382 --> 00:38.695
Mike and Rebecca.
This is news to me.

00:38.719 --> 00:39.946
I'm sure I told you.

00:39.970 --> 00:41.271
You told me, Charlie.

00:41.889 --> 00:43.690
Rebecca's in town.

00:44.099 --> 00:45.358
Rebecca Shea.

00:46.018 --> 00:47.954
Rebecca Norton. She got married.

00:47.978 --> 00:49.456
I thought she was
gonna marry you.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.292
Oh, no. No, that's right.
She dumped you.

00:52.316 --> 00:54.169
Don't you hate
when that happens?

00:54.193 --> 00:55.420
I wasn't gonna marry her.

00:55.444 --> 00:57.088
We had, like, five
dates in high school.

00:57.112 --> 00:58.506
And now she's back.

00:58.530 --> 00:59.883
I meant to tell you, really.

00:59.907 --> 01:01.718
Yes. Just a little too late

01:01.742 --> 01:03.678
for me to change my
plans to join you.

01:03.702 --> 01:06.264
Give me a break. It's not a big deal.
It's just dinner.

01:06.288 --> 01:08.600
You know, I was wondering why
you've been experimenting

01:08.624 --> 01:11.144
with the aftershaves
the past few days.

01:11.168 --> 01:12.761
The one that got away, huh?

01:18.759 --> 01:21.853
Oh, let's see.

01:23.388 --> 01:26.159
Chips, granola bars...

01:26.183 --> 01:28.411
There's a thermos
in here somewhere

01:28.435 --> 01:30.403
with hot chocolate in it.

01:30.979 --> 01:33.532
What's the matter? You
don't like hot chocolate?

01:33.565 --> 01:35.710
I've also got bottled water

01:35.734 --> 01:37.661
and magazines.

01:39.029 --> 01:40.799
Have you read the new
<i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

01:40.823 --> 01:42.759
It's the college
basketball edition.

01:42.783 --> 01:44.501
You probably brought stuff.

01:45.035 --> 01:46.920
What'd you bring, Barley?

01:50.999 --> 01:54.177
- Cards.
- Cards. What a great idea.

01:54.378 --> 01:56.096
We can play poker all night.

01:57.589 --> 01:59.692
I'm so excited we're gonna
get tickets for this.

01:59.716 --> 02:01.152
I'm really glad you called me.

02:01.176 --> 02:03.363
I just wish it wasn't
so cold out here.

02:03.387 --> 02:04.697
It's probably gonna
be a long night.

02:04.721 --> 02:06.241
It's okay.

02:06.265 --> 02:08.033
We'll just play cards and talk.

02:08.058 --> 02:09.494
We'll stay warm.

02:09.518 --> 02:12.413
I am very good at poker,
I should warn you.

02:12.437 --> 02:13.748
What do you want to play?

02:13.772 --> 02:16.960
Five-Card Stud,
Five-Card Draw, 21?

02:16.984 --> 02:18.869
Maybe strip poker?

02:19.987 --> 02:22.330
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

02:22.614 --> 02:24.249
Hi.

02:27.870 --> 02:30.046
This is a great idea, Bailey.

02:30.622 --> 02:33.425
So, who's winning?

02:34.793 --> 02:36.094
Nobody.

02:44.178 --> 02:47.699
Okay, so I hire two big
guys to kidnap him

02:47.723 --> 02:51.327
and take him off to some
remote island, or Hawaii.

02:51.351 --> 02:53.538
Someplace, just so Kate
doesn't see him for a while,

02:53.562 --> 02:56.573
and then eventually, she
forgets all about him.

02:57.024 --> 02:59.752
Hmm. I don't know, Bay.

02:59.776 --> 03:02.255
Kidnapping? I don't think they let
you graduate from high school

03:02.279 --> 03:04.048
if you've kidnapped someone.

03:04.072 --> 03:05.790
You know, I was in
something like this.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.760
I was in love with
this girl, Carol.

03:07.784 --> 03:09.554
She was great.

03:09.578 --> 03:11.379
She could stand on her hands.

03:11.914 --> 03:13.641
But she had this
boyfriend named Artie,

03:13.665 --> 03:15.351
and I wanted to get rid
of him, only I couldn't,

03:15.375 --> 03:17.437
because he lifted weights, and
his father was a policeman.

03:17.461 --> 03:19.105
So what did you do?

03:19.129 --> 03:20.565
I just waited.

03:20.589 --> 03:21.816
That's key.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.192
I didn't do anything,

03:23.216 --> 03:24.944
and sure enough, one day,
Artie moved out of town.

03:24.968 --> 03:25.904
So you got her?

03:25.928 --> 03:27.739
No, because Carol got mono

03:27.763 --> 03:29.115
and couldn't see anybody
for like a month,

03:29.139 --> 03:31.367
and by that time, I had
a crush on Robin Brown,

03:31.391 --> 03:33.026
but the point is...

03:33.936 --> 03:35.788
The point is...

03:35.812 --> 03:38.281
Kidnapping's looking
better and better, Will.

03:42.527 --> 03:44.756
- Do it. Do it, Charlie. -I'm
gonna move to another table.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.090
Do it. No, do it.

03:46.114 --> 03:47.425
You don't have to do this.

03:47.449 --> 03:49.427
- Sure, I will. I will.
- Do it, do it.

03:49.451 --> 03:51.095
Oh! I lose!

03:51.119 --> 03:53.338
Oh. Oh...

03:53.372 --> 03:54.849
Wow.

03:54.873 --> 03:56.309
I didn't want to
see that, Charlie.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.310
That is really disappointing.

03:57.334 --> 03:58.311
Dinner was on me anyway.

03:58.335 --> 03:59.604
What happened, Charlie? Come on.

03:59.628 --> 04:01.022
Where is your sense
of adventure?

04:01.046 --> 04:02.482
You burned me once, Mike.

04:02.506 --> 04:04.192
You think I'm gonna fall
for the same thing again?

04:04.216 --> 04:06.903
Yes, I do. What was that?
Was that a pineapple?

04:06.927 --> 04:07.820
Watermelon.

04:07.844 --> 04:09.239
A watermelon.

04:09.263 --> 04:11.032
Hey, we were all pretty drunk.

04:11.056 --> 04:12.075
You won 20 bucks.

04:12.099 --> 04:13.368
Yeah, but you got together

04:13.392 --> 04:14.702
waiting around the
emergency room

04:14.726 --> 04:15.954
while I got my stomach pumped.

04:15.978 --> 04:17.862
Bad timing, right, Charlie?

04:18.146 --> 04:19.791
You have no idea.

04:19.815 --> 04:21.209
I was getting the nerve up

04:21.233 --> 04:22.752
to ask you to go to Lake
Tahoe that weekend.

04:22.776 --> 04:25.296
Oh, right. I waited
around for you forever.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.714
You were never
gonna make a move.

04:26.738 --> 04:30.009
You were seeing that girl...
That, uh, Tina...

04:30.033 --> 04:31.386
Tina Van Dyke!

04:31.410 --> 04:32.387
Oh, man!

04:32.411 --> 04:33.763
I was over her!

04:33.787 --> 04:35.390
- I'm telling you.
- You were not over her.

04:35.414 --> 04:38.226
I'm telling you. By the time
I got out of the hospital,

04:38.250 --> 04:39.686
you guys were
practically engaged.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.562
You gave us the keys to Tahoe.

04:41.586 --> 04:42.772
I was delirious.

04:42.796 --> 04:44.274
We, uh... we named it

04:44.298 --> 04:46.641
the "Charlie Salinger
Memorial Lodge."

04:48.468 --> 04:50.238
It's funny how things work out.

04:50.262 --> 04:52.272
Hysterical.

04:53.098 --> 04:54.826
So, Charlie, you seeing anybody?

04:54.850 --> 04:57.485
- Yeah.
- Mm. Lucky boy.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.864
You always were a
lucky boy, Charlie.

05:01.565 --> 05:03.408
One time I got luckier.

05:08.488 --> 05:10.758
...Admit it. It's a
brilliant idea.

05:10.782 --> 05:12.385
Stage 18?

05:12.409 --> 05:14.721
Come on. You would make
more tips in one night

05:14.745 --> 05:17.255
than you would flipping
burgers an entire week.

05:17.456 --> 05:20.050
Besides, it wouldn't
be, like, a "job" job.

05:22.919 --> 05:24.596
Doesn't that make you insane?

05:26.423 --> 05:27.849
Yes.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:37.601 --> 05:39.579
- Claudia!
- Oh.

05:39.603 --> 05:41.696
I just thought I'd try out
the acoustics in here.

05:41.938 --> 05:43.750
Really cool. Listen.

05:43.774 --> 05:45.334
I don't want to listen.

05:45.358 --> 05:47.086
You've been playing the
same piece over and over,

05:47.110 --> 05:48.755
day and night, for,
like, the last month.

05:48.779 --> 05:50.423
Well, I'm having trouble
with the bowing.

05:50.447 --> 05:53.342
For God's sakes, Claudia.
You're 11 years old.

05:53.366 --> 05:56.137
You're not supposed to be standing
in the shower playing Paganini.

05:56.161 --> 05:57.346
Saint-Saens.

05:57.370 --> 05:58.306
Whatever.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.599
You should be doing
your homework

05:59.623 --> 06:01.100
or watching crap on TV or...

06:01.124 --> 06:03.102
I don't know, playing
dress-up or something.

06:03.126 --> 06:05.104
Dress-up. Yeah, right.

06:05.128 --> 06:07.430
Look, I think you should give
this a rest for a while, okay?

06:07.798 --> 06:09.650
Why don't you try
acting your age?

06:09.674 --> 06:12.519
Yeah? Why don't you
try acting your age?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.367
- You know what else, Jule?
- Mm-hmm.

06:18.391 --> 06:20.286
It's easier to meet
musicians after hours.

06:20.310 --> 06:22.445
That's when they like to
kick back and have a beer.

06:22.687 --> 06:24.114
Musicians, huh?

06:24.314 --> 06:26.241
Yeah. You'll be
fighting them off.

06:29.653 --> 06:30.912
Mike looks terrific.

06:31.029 --> 06:32.090
Yeah.

06:32.114 --> 06:33.466
You, too.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.083
How about this one?

06:35.492 --> 06:37.512
Excellent choice if you
want a sweet dessert wine.

06:37.536 --> 06:39.838
Ooh. No.

06:40.789 --> 06:42.850
You're just in town
for a couple days?

06:42.874 --> 06:44.393
Yeah. We've both gotta
be back at work

06:44.417 --> 06:46.219
first thing Monday morning.

06:46.336 --> 06:48.481
It's nice getting
back, isn't it?

06:48.505 --> 06:50.056
Mm-hmm.

06:51.424 --> 06:53.935
Charlie, I'm really glad things
are working out for you.

06:55.679 --> 06:57.865
I know how it's been,

06:57.889 --> 07:00.316
with your parents, and...

07:00.642 --> 07:02.286
I just think it's great
that you're happy,

07:02.310 --> 07:06.582
and you're working
and dating somebody

07:06.606 --> 07:08.042
and all that.

07:08.066 --> 07:09.701
Thanks.

07:10.402 --> 07:11.963
You and, uh...

07:11.987 --> 07:13.339
You and Mike, you seem good.

07:13.363 --> 07:14.914
Do we?

07:15.657 --> 07:18.084
That's pretty funny.

07:18.743 --> 07:20.096
Funny?

07:20.120 --> 07:22.723
Oh, because, um,
we're not so good.

07:22.747 --> 07:24.257
We're, um...

07:25.375 --> 07:27.260
We're closer to
rotten, actually.

07:28.336 --> 07:29.397
I'm sorry.

07:29.421 --> 07:30.648
No, it's just...

07:30.672 --> 07:32.275
Mike and I are...

07:32.299 --> 07:35.069
We're having a lot of problems,

07:35.093 --> 07:37.812
and, um, our marriage is...

07:40.432 --> 07:43.568
Well, I just don't think
it's gonna work out.

07:45.937 --> 07:47.614
How about this one?

07:51.109 --> 07:53.296
Hey! Did I tell you, this
guy on Tom's tennis team,

07:53.320 --> 07:56.122
he offered him 100 bucks
for his concert ticket.

07:56.490 --> 07:57.425
He's gonna sell it?

07:57.449 --> 07:58.718
Are you kidding?

07:58.742 --> 08:00.710
He wouldn't miss
it for anything.

08:01.369 --> 08:03.806
It'll be great. He is so funny.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.049
You know, he's taking
Italian as an elective,

08:06.333 --> 08:09.061
and he started keeping this
list of all these crazy phrases

08:09.085 --> 08:11.721
from his textbook, like, like...

08:12.464 --> 08:15.026
"I regret my car needs
a new coat of paint."

08:15.050 --> 08:16.194
Or...

08:16.218 --> 08:18.269
Oh, what was the other one?

08:19.054 --> 08:21.824
"Is there a hospital nearby,
as I have been shot."

08:21.848 --> 08:23.659
I mean, isn't that
totally ridiculous?

08:23.683 --> 08:25.610
When are you ever gonna
need to know how to say...

08:39.823 --> 08:41.458
Good night.

08:53.672 --> 08:56.317
And the magic fairy says
to the little mermaid,

08:56.341 --> 08:58.059
"You have a choice.

08:58.176 --> 09:00.404
You can have a beautiful
singing voice

09:00.428 --> 09:03.523
or marry the handsome prince,"

09:03.974 --> 09:05.743
and the little mermaid says,

09:05.767 --> 09:07.495
"I choose the singing voice."

09:07.519 --> 09:08.862
Hey.

09:09.104 --> 09:10.289
How's your mother?

09:10.313 --> 09:12.083
She went to Muir Woods today.

09:12.107 --> 09:14.033
She wants to drive
through a Redwood.

09:15.318 --> 09:16.911
How was last night?

09:17.487 --> 09:19.038
Uh, fine.

09:19.531 --> 09:20.800
How are your friends?

09:20.824 --> 09:23.302
Fine. I wish you'd been there.

09:23.326 --> 09:26.129
Uh-huh. How was Rebecca?

09:26.246 --> 09:27.755
Okay.

09:27.998 --> 09:30.049
How many dates did you
say you had with her?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.260
I told you. Six.

09:33.378 --> 09:35.013
You said five.

09:36.756 --> 09:38.182
What about you?

09:38.383 --> 09:40.319
How many guys did you date
when you were in high school?

09:40.343 --> 09:42.353
Some. A couple.

09:42.804 --> 09:45.199
And if they showed up and
wanted to have dinner with you,

09:45.223 --> 09:46.941
you think I'd give you
the third degree?

09:47.058 --> 09:48.443
Uh-huh.

09:51.563 --> 09:52.864
Maybe.

09:55.108 --> 09:56.576
How'd she look?

09:56.776 --> 09:58.129
Gained about 50 pounds,

09:58.153 --> 10:00.788
bad dye job, plastic
surgery didn't take...

10:01.906 --> 10:03.499
You've got nothing
to worry about.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.469
I'd like to meet her.

10:05.493 --> 10:06.971
I'd like to meet both of them.

10:06.995 --> 10:08.848
Maybe we could all have
lunch this afternoon.

10:08.872 --> 10:11.299
Um, I think they've got plans.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.301
Maybe next time.

10:21.343 --> 10:22.894
Come in!

10:25.138 --> 10:26.981
Oh, hi.

10:28.016 --> 10:29.201
Come on in.

10:29.225 --> 10:30.443
No.

10:30.602 --> 10:32.070
Okay.

10:33.521 --> 10:35.499
I was, uh, picking up.

10:35.523 --> 10:37.126
I don't think you should
go to the concert tonight.

10:37.150 --> 10:38.294
What?

10:38.318 --> 10:40.671
It'd just be too awkward, the
three of us there. Okay?

10:40.695 --> 10:42.798
Yeah, I agree. We've got to
do something about that.

10:42.822 --> 10:44.040
You stay home.

10:44.115 --> 10:45.343
I don't want to stay home.

10:45.367 --> 10:46.594
It was my idea.

10:46.618 --> 10:47.511
I'm the one who invited you.

10:47.535 --> 10:49.764
- Tell Tom to stay home.
- Why should Tom stay home?

10:49.788 --> 10:51.515
- Why should I stay home?
- Would you cut it out?

10:51.539 --> 10:53.267
The three of us cannot
go to this thing.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.477
It would just be too weird.

10:54.501 --> 10:56.646
- Fine, then I'll call Tom
and I'll... -No, you won't.

10:56.670 --> 10:59.732
The thing is, he wants to go with you.
He likes you.

10:59.756 --> 11:02.902
Oh, great. He likes me? We
spend all this time together,

11:02.926 --> 11:04.236
he doesn't even see
me as competition?

11:04.260 --> 11:06.238
I guess he should, huh?
After last night.

11:06.262 --> 11:07.239
I mean, what was that?

11:07.263 --> 11:08.783
- That was a kiss.
- Don't be a smart-ass.

11:08.807 --> 11:09.742
Look, why do you think

11:09.766 --> 11:11.160
I've been hanging around
you all these weeks?

11:11.184 --> 11:12.495
Because I like being
the best friend?

11:12.519 --> 11:16.030
I don't know. I guess...
I don't know.

11:16.439 --> 11:17.990
Well, now you do.

11:18.525 --> 11:20.086
I'm going to the
concert tonight.

11:20.110 --> 11:21.670
You're kidding. A license?

11:21.694 --> 11:23.413
She doesn't even have
a learner's permit.

11:24.155 --> 11:25.998
Did he give her a ticket?

11:26.449 --> 11:28.835
Oh, my God. Her
mom's gonna freak.

11:29.035 --> 11:30.763
Could you just sign
this really quick?

11:30.787 --> 11:32.765
It's my application
for the competition.

11:32.789 --> 11:34.392
I'm on the phone, Claud.

11:34.416 --> 11:35.893
If you're gonna steal
your mom's car,

11:35.917 --> 11:37.686
you should at least check
the gas gauge, right?

11:37.710 --> 11:38.687
Just sign it.

11:38.711 --> 11:39.855
Here's a pen.

11:39.879 --> 11:41.556
Now you're really
getting on my nerves.

11:42.674 --> 11:44.735
You do? Oh, sure.

11:44.759 --> 11:46.487
Okay, I'll see you there.

11:46.511 --> 11:47.979
Bye.

11:48.096 --> 11:49.939
Hang it up.

11:51.057 --> 11:53.276
See...

11:53.393 --> 11:55.653
right here.

12:00.233 --> 12:01.877
You wrote your age down wrong.

12:01.901 --> 12:03.745
You wrote nine instead of 11.

12:04.028 --> 12:05.747
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

12:05.947 --> 12:07.457
Oops.

12:07.615 --> 12:09.208
I'll cross that out.

12:10.743 --> 12:12.336
What's going on with you?

12:13.329 --> 12:16.434
Nothing. I just wanted
you to sign this,

12:16.458 --> 12:18.227
but if you're gonna make
such a big deal out of it...

12:18.251 --> 12:20.479
Did you think that the judges
would go easier on you

12:20.503 --> 12:21.971
if they thought
you were younger?

12:22.672 --> 12:23.973
Never mind.

12:24.591 --> 12:25.484
I'll ask Bailey,

12:25.508 --> 12:27.570
since he's got to write the
check for the entry fee anyway.

12:27.594 --> 12:29.155
No, you won't. Claudia,

12:29.179 --> 12:31.147
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

12:31.514 --> 12:32.940
What?

12:33.516 --> 12:34.827
What are you talking about?

12:34.851 --> 12:37.320
About you being in
the competition.

12:37.896 --> 12:40.624
If winning is so important to you
that you're willing to cheat...

12:40.648 --> 12:42.293
I'll just ask Bailey.

12:42.317 --> 12:43.502
He'll let me.

12:43.526 --> 12:45.995
Not if I tell him what
you did, he won't.

12:46.404 --> 12:49.749
I've worked really hard for this.
This matters to me.

12:49.824 --> 12:51.876
Well, maybe it should
matter a little less.

12:52.660 --> 12:54.430
You should play because
you love it, Claudia,

12:54.454 --> 12:57.006
not because you're some psycho
case who just has to win.

12:58.791 --> 13:00.510
Maybe next year you'll be ready.

13:00.668 --> 13:02.104
I'm ready now!

13:02.128 --> 13:03.846
I don't think so.

13:04.797 --> 13:06.150
What's the deal
with you and Mike?

13:06.174 --> 13:07.401
I mean, you guys just...

13:07.425 --> 13:08.810
Oh, don't say it.

13:09.010 --> 13:11.155
I'm sorry about all this.

13:11.179 --> 13:13.157
Oh, no, it's not terrible.

13:13.181 --> 13:15.233
We don't hate each other.
It's just...

13:16.434 --> 13:20.238
it's not good enough
to tolerate someone.

13:20.313 --> 13:22.114
You know what I mean?

13:22.899 --> 13:24.492
It's like...

13:25.360 --> 13:27.078
when Mike and I
go out to dinner,

13:27.487 --> 13:30.122
I have this feeling he's always
looking over my shoulder,

13:30.698 --> 13:33.802
waiting to see if some other
more-interesting woman

13:33.826 --> 13:35.920
will walk in the room.

13:39.123 --> 13:40.967
But I don't blame him.

13:42.126 --> 13:43.771
I know how he feels.

13:43.795 --> 13:46.774
I... I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

13:46.798 --> 13:48.817
wondering what...

13:48.841 --> 13:52.061
What doors I might
have closed too soon.

14:00.019 --> 14:01.247
Now, my cousin, Stephanie

14:01.271 --> 14:02.957
worked here for a while,

14:02.981 --> 14:04.250
but she had to quit.

14:04.274 --> 14:06.284
- Why'd she quit?
- They fired her.

14:06.818 --> 14:08.911
We're not open, girls.

14:09.153 --> 14:10.714
Oh, yeah, well, we know,

14:10.738 --> 14:13.300
but, uh... we heard
you were hiring

14:13.324 --> 14:14.468
a new waitress.

14:14.492 --> 14:15.553
Oh, yeah?

14:15.577 --> 14:17.012
You ever waitressed before?

14:17.036 --> 14:19.014
Oh, not me. My friend here.

14:19.038 --> 14:20.715
Oh. Hmm.

14:21.124 --> 14:22.768
You 21? Nah.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.186
I don't think so.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.429
Um, sure she is.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.107
Sure I am.

14:28.131 --> 14:31.184
Oh, yeah? Got any,
like, ID or anything?

14:31.217 --> 14:32.570
ID?

14:32.594 --> 14:36.198
Yeah, well, let's go
with a driver's license?

14:36.222 --> 14:40.776
I don't drive... anymore.

14:41.811 --> 14:44.373
There was kind of
this dumb accident.

14:44.397 --> 14:46.782
Oh, so dumb.

14:47.108 --> 14:49.962
This woman, she was backing
out of her driveway,

14:49.986 --> 14:52.423
and I just kind of tapped her.

14:52.447 --> 14:54.832
Yeah. It wasn't her fault.

14:54.908 --> 14:56.542
And it turns out...

14:57.285 --> 14:59.305
Well, it turns out
that she just...

14:59.329 --> 15:01.339
She was married to an attorney

15:01.623 --> 15:05.144
who just happened to know
someone down at the DMV, so...

15:05.168 --> 15:07.386
That's amazing. Oh, man.

15:08.171 --> 15:09.972
You ever waitressed before?

15:10.757 --> 15:12.308
Sure. Lots.

15:13.217 --> 15:14.737
Keep up the practice, kid.

15:14.761 --> 15:17.647
Come back when you're 21. Bye.

15:34.238 --> 15:35.873
What are you doing?

15:36.240 --> 15:39.543
That was funny, you not
showing up at the concert.

15:39.744 --> 15:41.513
I told you I wasn't gonna go.

15:41.537 --> 15:43.256
Tommy and me had
a terrific time.

15:43.331 --> 15:45.059
He wants to take
me to a Cal game.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.602
I think we're going steady.

15:46.626 --> 15:49.021
You shouldn't be here, Bailey.

15:49.045 --> 15:52.056
I know. I know I shouldn't.

15:53.466 --> 15:54.818
I know that...

15:54.842 --> 15:56.278
That moving in on
another guy's girl

15:56.302 --> 15:57.738
isn't the nice thing to do,

15:57.762 --> 16:00.115
and I know that it's
particularly sleazy

16:00.139 --> 16:02.775
when the guy happens to be okay,

16:03.059 --> 16:04.694
and Tom is.

16:05.019 --> 16:06.737
He's okay.

16:06.854 --> 16:08.656
But you...

16:09.357 --> 16:10.950
You know what?

16:11.734 --> 16:13.411
I don't care.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.872
I really don't care about
doing the right thing,

16:17.115 --> 16:20.511
and in case you see this as a
real flaw in my character,

16:20.535 --> 16:21.971
you should probably know that...

16:21.995 --> 16:24.046
that I'm usually a
pretty good guy.

16:24.414 --> 16:28.551
You know, I always hold the
elevator door for people,

16:28.668 --> 16:30.386
no matter how late I am.

16:32.296 --> 16:34.483
And I always use my
signal when I'm driving.

16:34.507 --> 16:36.475
You know, a lot of people
don't do that. Me...

16:36.592 --> 16:38.519
that blinker's always going.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.646
Never cheated on my income tax.

16:42.348 --> 16:44.702
Of course, I've never
done any income tax,

16:44.726 --> 16:47.037
but you can bet when
it's time to do it,

16:47.061 --> 16:48.612
I'm gonna do it right.

16:49.647 --> 16:52.658
So... so that's it.

16:53.192 --> 16:54.785
I want you to marry me.

16:55.611 --> 16:57.204
Take it or leave it.

16:57.822 --> 16:59.883
It's gonna be a little tight
in my house at first.

16:59.907 --> 17:02.710
You know, we're gonna have to share
a room with my baby brother Owen.

17:04.787 --> 17:06.422
What do you think?

17:07.749 --> 17:09.759
Oh, Barley.

17:11.461 --> 17:13.095
Just try me.

17:13.628 --> 17:15.263
Marry you?

17:15.548 --> 17:18.684
One date. Tomorrow afternoon.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.686
You can think of it as
kind of a taste test.

17:25.474 --> 17:28.486
Okay. Okay.

17:30.730 --> 17:32.198
Good night.

17:36.527 --> 17:37.912
Yes.

17:43.993 --> 17:46.420
Mike went up to Mendocino.
He, um...

17:47.121 --> 17:49.173
He won't be back till
tomorrow afternoon.

17:49.457 --> 17:51.133
I, um...

17:52.126 --> 17:54.303
I don't know what to say.

17:55.379 --> 17:57.107
I think I should
just keep talking,

17:57.131 --> 17:58.609
because I'm...

17:58.633 --> 18:00.434
If I don't, I'm afraid...

18:11.312 --> 18:12.748
What are we gonna do?

18:12.772 --> 18:14.573
Where are we gonna go?

18:15.066 --> 18:16.659
We could go inside.

18:16.901 --> 18:19.745
No, Charlie, it's
my parents' house.

18:20.029 --> 18:22.132
We can't do it inside.

18:22.156 --> 18:24.593
We can't do it in there.

18:24.617 --> 18:26.460
I feel like I'm 16.

18:29.539 --> 18:31.090
We could go to your house.

18:31.415 --> 18:35.052
No. My family's there.
It's not...

18:35.628 --> 18:37.471
It wouldn't work.

18:40.633 --> 18:43.144
Well, all grown up
and nowhere to go.

19:16.836 --> 19:19.231
No, no. Put your leg...

19:19.255 --> 19:21.015
That's good.

19:40.151 --> 19:42.995
- Late night, huh?
- Yeah.

19:43.821 --> 19:46.457
You look beat. How'd you sleep?

19:47.158 --> 19:49.585
Okay. I slept okay.

19:54.790 --> 19:58.020
My mom decided she wanted
to stop by the restaurant

19:58.044 --> 19:59.595
and surprise you last night.

20:00.755 --> 20:01.815
She did?

20:01.839 --> 20:03.984
Yeah, only I was
rapidly approaching

20:04.008 --> 20:06.111
my mother quotient for the day.

20:06.135 --> 20:07.237
If we'd stayed for dinner,

20:07.261 --> 20:08.739
I probably would've
leaned across the table

20:08.763 --> 20:10.439
and stabbed her with
my steak knife.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.736
Anyway, we just ended up going
back to her hotel and watching TV.

20:16.979 --> 20:19.448
I think she thinks
I've made you up,

20:19.774 --> 20:22.493
my scruffy boyfriend
who's never around.

20:23.402 --> 20:24.922
We'll... we'll hook up.

20:24.946 --> 20:26.539
What about today?

20:26.572 --> 20:28.499
She's touring wine country.

20:28.824 --> 20:31.210
I can't wait till she leaves.

20:31.869 --> 20:35.297
Hey... I miss you.

20:36.582 --> 20:38.050
Same here.

20:48.219 --> 20:50.145
Are you having second thoughts?

20:51.806 --> 20:55.118
Okay, look, Claud, that's fine.

20:55.142 --> 20:57.204
I'm sorry. This is
probably a really bad...

20:57.228 --> 20:58.862
It's not me.

20:59.981 --> 21:01.532
It's my family.

21:01.607 --> 21:03.085
They don't want you to compete?

21:03.109 --> 21:06.412
Well, Julia says it's too much
money for the application.

21:06.487 --> 21:07.839
You want me to call her?

21:07.863 --> 21:11.250
No. She'd just be embarrassed.

21:11.993 --> 21:15.222
Okay. How about I pay
the application fee?

21:15.246 --> 21:18.267
You don't have to. There's
always next year.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.893
It's not a big deal.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.144
I couldn't ask you to do that.

21:21.168 --> 21:23.470
- Claudia...
- I'll pay you back.

21:26.549 --> 21:28.475
Could you just sign
the application?

21:28.843 --> 21:30.561
I need an adult.

21:30.761 --> 21:32.438
Sure.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.747
What do you think?

21:50.156 --> 21:52.291
How many guys do you
think you'll meet?

21:52.950 --> 21:54.845
Thousands, probably.

21:54.869 --> 21:57.212
This could be so great, Julia.

21:58.247 --> 22:00.225
I would go crazy to
work at Stage 18,

22:00.249 --> 22:02.269
but my mom would find
out in a second.

22:02.293 --> 22:04.553
You're so lucky.

22:06.297 --> 22:07.848
Um...

22:08.382 --> 22:10.152
You know what I mean.

22:10.176 --> 22:11.769
Yeah.

22:15.014 --> 22:17.733
So, um... smile,

22:18.225 --> 22:20.120
and think about...

22:20.144 --> 22:21.330
- Keanu Reeves.
- Keanu Reeves.

22:21.354 --> 22:22.863
Exactly.

22:45.044 --> 22:46.428
Dry.

22:48.589 --> 22:51.860
Okay, so now we type
in your new birthdate

22:51.884 --> 22:54.478
right here, like this...

22:57.932 --> 23:00.317
And congratulations. You're 21.

23:06.357 --> 23:08.242
A Rob Roy, please.

23:11.779 --> 23:13.799
- A Rob Roy?
- Mm-hmm.

23:13.823 --> 23:15.749
I've always wanted to order one.

23:16.033 --> 23:17.469
What is it?

23:17.493 --> 23:21.056
Um, scotch, vermouth, bitters.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.297
Ugh.

23:22.373 --> 23:23.715
Diet soda.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.844
- You got it.
- I, um...

23:27.002 --> 23:29.564
I think I have a gearshift
impression in my back.

23:29.588 --> 23:31.306
Maybe I should
take a look at it.

23:32.925 --> 23:37.187
And, um... my left arm
is still a little numb.

23:38.430 --> 23:40.232
My right arm.

23:40.975 --> 23:43.193
I had the weirdest
dream last night.

23:43.727 --> 23:46.905
Pots on the stove, boiling over.

23:48.190 --> 23:49.783
It's gotta be Freudian.

23:55.573 --> 23:57.332
I think I'm gonna tell Mike...

23:58.492 --> 24:00.043
that it's over.

24:01.871 --> 24:03.589
That I'm leaving him.

24:10.546 --> 24:12.806
I thought I ought to tell you.

24:16.385 --> 24:17.696
See, that's the thing

24:17.720 --> 24:18.905
about living in a
big tourist town

24:18.929 --> 24:20.157
is that you never end up doing

24:20.181 --> 24:21.950
any of the fun tourist stuff,

24:21.974 --> 24:23.233
like, for example,

24:23.309 --> 24:25.486
have you ever actually
ridden on a cable car?

24:25.769 --> 24:28.071
Sure, of course.
Hasn't everyone?

24:29.690 --> 24:31.950
Have you ever walked
across Golden Gate Bridge?

24:32.151 --> 24:34.828
I jog it all the time.

24:35.362 --> 24:37.382
Ever taken in a nudie
show in North Beach?

24:37.406 --> 24:39.041
You got me.

24:40.117 --> 24:41.219
All right, then that's the plan

24:41.243 --> 24:43.086
for the second half
of the afternoon.

24:43.204 --> 24:45.640
I promise you, by the end
of today, it's going to be

24:45.664 --> 24:48.342
like you're seeing everything in
this town for the first time.

24:48.918 --> 24:50.594
Everything.

24:51.545 --> 24:53.388
That's the plan, huh?

24:53.672 --> 24:54.816
That's the plan.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.735
<i>The next ferry to Alcatraz</i>

24:56.759 --> 24:58.685
<i>leaves in eight minutes.</i>

24:59.053 --> 25:00.854
That's us.

25:02.932 --> 25:04.858
I think you are so
incredibly beautiful.

25:05.851 --> 25:07.287
Bailey, God...

25:07.311 --> 25:08.654
You are.

25:10.397 --> 25:11.990
No, I'm not.

25:12.233 --> 25:14.002
I've got this funny nose

25:14.026 --> 25:15.670
and my ears kind of stick out

25:15.694 --> 25:17.088
and I'm too thin.

25:17.112 --> 25:18.256
You're beautiful.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.581
Stop.

25:20.616 --> 25:22.385
I don't know what
to say to that.

25:22.409 --> 25:24.638
Don't say anything.

25:24.662 --> 25:26.004
Just...

25:27.289 --> 25:28.799
Just know that I think it.

25:32.628 --> 25:34.137
Okay?

25:36.674 --> 25:38.225
Don't pick it up.

25:39.134 --> 25:40.978
You fall into a
Maybelline display?

25:45.474 --> 25:47.025
Hello?

25:47.434 --> 25:48.787
Yes, he is.

25:48.811 --> 25:50.612
Just a second.

25:50.729 --> 25:51.831
Rebecca.

25:51.855 --> 25:53.198
I'm not here, okay?

25:53.691 --> 25:55.418
Charlie, I just said...

25:55.442 --> 25:58.620
Tell her I'm not here. I
don't wanna talk to her.

25:59.071 --> 26:01.540
I'm sorry. He was here.

26:01.699 --> 26:04.543
I guess he went out to
the market or something.

26:05.286 --> 26:08.380
Oh, really? Okay.

26:09.081 --> 26:12.092
I'll tell him when he gets back.
Bye.

26:12.793 --> 26:14.854
Says she's called here
four times already.

26:14.878 --> 26:16.356
I'll call her back.

26:16.380 --> 26:18.942
Mm-hmm. What's going on?

26:18.966 --> 26:21.027
Nothing. I just don't feel
like talking to her right now.

26:21.051 --> 26:23.488
Yeah, right. You're
avoiding her.

26:23.512 --> 26:25.240
I'm not avoiding.

26:25.264 --> 26:27.232
Look, just cut it
out, would you?

26:27.349 --> 26:29.286
You and she have a thing
going or something.

26:29.310 --> 26:31.037
Shut up. We do not
have a "thing."

26:31.061 --> 26:32.571
What is this?

26:34.148 --> 26:36.241
Business as usual, huh, Charlie?

26:38.485 --> 26:41.288
She calls back, I'm going to tell
her you're sitting right here.

26:45.159 --> 26:46.761
The second group
competes in the morning,

26:46.785 --> 26:49.671
so we should have the
results by noon, I'd say.

26:49.913 --> 26:51.725
You did a great job today.

26:51.749 --> 26:52.934
You think?

26:52.958 --> 26:54.561
I mean, the bowing in the
third movement was...

26:54.585 --> 26:55.729
It was great.

26:55.753 --> 26:56.771
Where have you been?

26:56.795 --> 26:58.023
Uh, well...

26:58.047 --> 26:59.316
You would have been
proud of her, Julia.

26:59.340 --> 27:00.557
She did very well.

27:00.924 --> 27:02.110
Really?

27:02.134 --> 27:03.486
At what?

27:03.510 --> 27:05.155
Well, it doesn't matter.

27:05.179 --> 27:07.105
Of course, it does.
At the competition.

27:07.264 --> 27:09.483
Wait a second. You
let her compete?

27:09.767 --> 27:11.077
What is going on here?

27:11.101 --> 27:12.120
Julia, you don't have...

27:12.144 --> 27:13.528
Claudia, be quiet.

27:13.729 --> 27:15.457
Where do you get off?

27:15.481 --> 27:17.709
You're her teacher,
not her parent.

27:17.733 --> 27:19.502
I mean, if I say that
she's not competing,

27:19.526 --> 27:21.129
then that's the
end of the story.

27:21.153 --> 27:25.290
Whoa. Julia, maybe you should
just cool down a little, okay?

27:25.574 --> 27:28.094
All I did was pay the application
fee that you didn't want to pay.

27:28.118 --> 27:30.889
- Ross... -That's right. I
didn't want to pay it.

27:30.913 --> 27:34.142
I don't believe in 11-year-olds
practicing 24 hours a day

27:34.166 --> 27:36.144
and claiming to be nine
on an application.

27:36.168 --> 27:37.771
- Julia, stop...
- What?

27:37.795 --> 27:39.471
What, you didn't read it?

27:39.546 --> 27:42.849
You haven't noticed how obsessed
she's been with this competition?

27:43.008 --> 27:44.486
Would you like to explain this?

27:44.510 --> 27:46.738
You seem to be doing
a pretty good job.

27:46.762 --> 27:48.146
I'm sorry.

27:48.389 --> 27:50.732
Maybe I should have
paid more attention.

27:50.766 --> 27:52.327
You should have asked me.

27:52.351 --> 27:55.497
Why? Why does Ross have
to ask you anything?

27:55.521 --> 27:57.707
- Claudia... - Because someone's
got to look after you.

27:57.731 --> 27:59.574
And that's you?

28:00.526 --> 28:01.669
Who are you kidding?

28:01.693 --> 28:04.663
Listen, maybe the two
of you should talk.

28:05.489 --> 28:07.008
I'll see you in the morning.

28:07.032 --> 28:08.343
Bye, Julia.

28:08.367 --> 28:09.761
Don't you walk away from me.

28:09.785 --> 28:11.262
I don't have to listen to you.

28:11.286 --> 28:12.639
You want to bet?

28:12.663 --> 28:15.016
You don't have to listen to anybody.
How come I do?

28:15.040 --> 28:16.518
Because you're 11,
and I'm older.

28:16.542 --> 28:17.894
You're not that much older.

28:17.918 --> 28:19.687
Old enough. You disobeyed me.

28:19.711 --> 28:20.647
Yeah.

28:20.671 --> 28:22.440
So what are you going to do?
Ground me?

28:22.464 --> 28:24.651
Maybe. You think the only one

28:24.675 --> 28:26.569
you have to listen to in
this house is Bailey.

28:26.593 --> 28:28.311
At least he cares about me.

28:29.054 --> 28:30.981
What are you talking about?

28:33.058 --> 28:36.653
Why do you think I've been concerned
about you doing this competition?

28:37.813 --> 28:40.083
- Because I care.
- Right.

28:40.107 --> 28:42.617
And that's why you're
acting like such a bitch.

28:42.735 --> 28:44.504
Don't say "bitch."

28:44.528 --> 28:46.872
I don't want you using
language like that.

28:48.115 --> 28:49.666
You know what?

28:50.117 --> 28:53.179
Maybe you could just try and
come and hear me play for once

28:53.203 --> 28:56.131
instead of just telling me
what not to do all the time.

28:58.041 --> 28:59.519
Okay, Claudia, look...

28:59.543 --> 29:01.720
Don't walk away. We're
not finished talking.

29:02.171 --> 29:03.680
You're not my mother.

29:10.345 --> 29:11.730
Hey.

29:12.306 --> 29:13.690
It's a bicycle.

29:14.641 --> 29:16.234
Bailey...

29:16.518 --> 29:18.361
Hey, Bailey.

29:19.855 --> 29:21.291
What's going on?

29:21.315 --> 29:23.283
I didn't miss your
birthday, did I?

29:24.610 --> 29:26.713
Is there something
I don't get here?

29:26.737 --> 29:29.174
There's... It's...

29:29.198 --> 29:30.842
Bailey, this isn't a good time.

29:30.866 --> 29:32.584
Wait a second. I thought...

29:33.076 --> 29:35.545
Help me out here a little, Kate.
What's he doing here?

29:35.662 --> 29:37.098
We had a date, Bailey.

29:37.122 --> 29:38.924
Is there a problem?

29:39.082 --> 29:41.060
That's funny, Tom,
because Kate and I...

29:41.084 --> 29:42.719
Bailey, please.

29:48.884 --> 29:50.477
Forget it.

29:51.094 --> 29:52.687
Kate and you what?

29:56.099 --> 29:57.734
What's going on here?

29:58.143 --> 30:00.570
- What are you trying to pull, Bailey?
- You tell me.

30:00.771 --> 30:02.665
What are you gonna do, pound
me with your killer serve?

30:02.689 --> 30:03.625
Bailey!

30:03.649 --> 30:05.126
Listen, why don't you
just get out of here?

30:05.150 --> 30:06.419
I'm not going anywhere.

30:06.443 --> 30:07.670
Did you hear what I said?

30:07.694 --> 30:10.163
- You talking to me?
- Go home, Bailey.

30:10.405 --> 30:11.508
What?

30:11.532 --> 30:13.166
Just go home.

30:13.742 --> 30:15.335
Get out of here. I mean it.

30:39.977 --> 30:41.862
Thanks for returning
my phone calls.

30:44.439 --> 30:46.241
I'm sorry.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.836
Charlie, what is going on?

30:47.860 --> 30:49.629
I got busy. I had work stuff.

30:49.653 --> 30:51.172
I had things to do, you know?
I...

30:51.196 --> 30:53.623
No, I don't know. You tell me.

30:54.741 --> 30:57.210
All you had to do was
pick up a phone.

30:57.494 --> 30:59.462
I really needed to talk to you.

31:00.539 --> 31:02.090
I know.

31:03.041 --> 31:05.093
I know. We need to talk.

31:05.294 --> 31:07.730
Um... I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

31:07.754 --> 31:11.568
and I just... I
just have to say,

31:11.592 --> 31:13.736
I think you're making
a big mistake.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.113
What?

31:15.137 --> 31:16.938
Leaving Mike.

31:17.014 --> 31:18.815
Oh, you do? Really?

31:19.391 --> 31:22.360
Because you and me, I mean...

31:22.811 --> 31:25.748
Let's be honest. What are the
chances of that working, huh?

31:25.772 --> 31:28.793
I mean, you guys have been
together a long time.

31:28.817 --> 31:30.461
It's worth trying
to work it out.

31:30.485 --> 31:32.412
Isn't it? I mean...

31:32.529 --> 31:34.206
Maybe if...

31:34.531 --> 31:36.175
you and Mike got...

31:36.199 --> 31:38.168
some kind of counseling.

31:39.536 --> 31:43.632
I just don't want you
to do anything hasty.

31:44.374 --> 31:47.135
- Like leave him for you?
- Yeah.

31:48.295 --> 31:50.180
Yes.

31:52.382 --> 31:54.559
Oh, my God, Charlie.

31:54.927 --> 31:57.103
You're really incredible.

31:58.972 --> 32:01.983
You thought all
this was about you?

32:04.186 --> 32:06.331
Our marriage is over.

32:06.355 --> 32:08.073
It's over,

32:08.607 --> 32:10.992
and it's not because
I slept with you.

32:11.610 --> 32:16.623
It's over because I am so...
unhappy.

32:18.450 --> 32:20.585
And that's why I needed you,

32:21.203 --> 32:23.056
but you're so damned
scared of obligation,

32:23.080 --> 32:26.758
and you're so scared of
what all this means to you.

32:28.585 --> 32:30.095
God.

32:30.712 --> 32:33.098
You are a stupid bastard.

32:42.975 --> 32:46.319
Play dead. Dead.

32:47.354 --> 32:49.582
No, not living and breathing.

32:49.606 --> 32:50.833
Dead.

32:50.857 --> 32:52.585
Just look at me, Thurber.

32:52.609 --> 32:54.244
Act like this.

32:56.613 --> 32:59.708
I wanted to give
this back to you.

33:00.242 --> 33:02.919
Tom sort of kicked it
around a couple of times.

33:03.745 --> 33:05.380
I can't keep it.

33:08.375 --> 33:10.969
It's probably broken anyway.

33:12.546 --> 33:14.806
I wish you hadn't
come by last night.

33:15.549 --> 33:17.986
That's funny. I could
say the same thing.

33:18.010 --> 33:20.520
Bailey, this is
really hard for me.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.316
I didn't know what was going
to happen with any of this.

33:24.683 --> 33:26.818
I met you, I was dating Tom.

33:27.019 --> 33:28.778
I mean, did I lead you on?

33:29.187 --> 33:30.832
I guess I did,

33:30.856 --> 33:32.657
but I don't know.

33:34.151 --> 33:36.077
I really like you.

33:36.653 --> 33:38.246
You're great,

33:38.447 --> 33:40.591
and I like Tom, too. He's great,

33:40.615 --> 33:42.584
and what am I supposed to do?

33:42.743 --> 33:44.929
I mean, you asked me for
a date, and I said yes,

33:44.953 --> 33:46.723
and maybe that was
incredibly dumb,

33:46.747 --> 33:47.974
or maybe it would
have been great

33:47.998 --> 33:50.467
if we'd had a terrible
time, but we didn't.

33:51.001 --> 33:53.136
And that just made
things weirder.

33:55.255 --> 33:56.941
Tom's a good guy,

33:56.965 --> 33:58.683
and I've known him forever.

33:59.718 --> 34:01.644
Well, you can know me forever.

34:07.434 --> 34:11.571
Okay, look, I don't want
to do this anymore.

34:12.147 --> 34:13.708
I mean, if I were
a different guy,

34:13.732 --> 34:15.460
I would probably
look you in the eye

34:15.484 --> 34:17.420
and say, "It's either him or me.

34:17.444 --> 34:19.079
Choose."

34:20.030 --> 34:22.884
But since we've only
been out on one date,

34:22.908 --> 34:25.627
that seems a little premature.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.507
The point is...

34:32.375 --> 34:35.261
if you're gonna keep
seeing Tom, then I just...

34:36.670 --> 34:38.264
I have to walk away.

34:38.632 --> 34:40.100
Because...

34:41.760 --> 34:43.978
Because I like you way too much,

34:44.929 --> 34:48.400
and it's just too damn hard,

34:49.059 --> 34:51.319
and I feel pretty damn stupid.

34:52.687 --> 34:55.989
So I guess what I'm saying is...

34:57.567 --> 34:59.536
it's him or me.

34:59.694 --> 35:01.621
Choose.

35:07.327 --> 35:09.587
Congratulations.

35:12.541 --> 35:13.976
Second place goes

35:14.000 --> 35:16.261
to Richard Hamrick.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.893
Congratulations.

35:25.345 --> 35:28.699
And the 1994 winner

35:28.723 --> 35:32.036
of the San Francisco
Conservatory Award

35:32.060 --> 35:33.611
goes to...

35:33.979 --> 35:36.531
Lisa Dabney.

35:41.862 --> 35:44.330
It was a great experience,
though, don't you think?

35:44.990 --> 35:46.458
I liked your piece.

35:47.033 --> 35:48.543
Thanks.

35:49.244 --> 35:51.264
- I liked yours, too.
- Oh, thanks.

35:51.288 --> 35:52.265
Congratulations.

35:52.289 --> 35:54.090
It's just second place.

35:56.668 --> 35:59.179
My mom came in second
in this competition.

36:01.006 --> 36:03.141
A long time ago.

36:09.806 --> 36:11.649
I'm such a moron.

36:11.683 --> 36:13.735
I can't believe
what a moron I am.

36:13.894 --> 36:15.705
You are a moron.

36:15.729 --> 36:16.706
I just...

36:16.730 --> 36:18.531
I kind of forced the issue.

36:19.316 --> 36:22.879
- The issue?
- With Kate, about Tom.

36:22.903 --> 36:23.880
The boyfriend?

36:23.904 --> 36:25.455
Yep.

36:25.530 --> 36:26.841
You said him or you?

36:26.865 --> 36:27.842
Pretty much.

36:27.866 --> 36:29.635
- Wow.
- Yeah.

36:29.659 --> 36:31.721
- And?
- And what?

36:31.745 --> 36:34.088
Would I be a moron if
everything had worked out?

36:34.831 --> 36:36.716
Good point by you.

36:39.294 --> 36:41.355
Where are you going?

36:41.379 --> 36:42.565
Running.

36:42.589 --> 36:44.275
Running? You hate running.

36:44.299 --> 36:46.100
You were only running
to be with Kate.

36:52.766 --> 36:56.152
The thing is, I made her choose.

36:56.228 --> 36:58.905
I said it's all or nothing,
but the truth is...

37:00.357 --> 37:02.033
The truth is...

37:04.319 --> 37:06.371
I would have settled
for a lot less.

37:09.783 --> 37:11.417
I'm going running.

37:21.711 --> 37:23.731
<i>Check. Check.</i>

37:23.755 --> 37:25.399
Still looking for a waitress?

37:25.423 --> 37:27.318
Aw. No.

37:27.342 --> 37:30.019
I'm still looking for
a waitress who's 21.

37:32.931 --> 37:35.034
Birth certificate. ID card.

37:35.058 --> 37:36.985
Mm-hmm.

37:42.983 --> 37:45.044
You really want this
job, don't you?

37:45.068 --> 37:46.545
You bet.

37:46.569 --> 37:48.547
Oh, God.

37:48.571 --> 37:51.499
You know, you're very...
persuasive, but I...

37:52.242 --> 37:53.960
Ah...

37:54.202 --> 37:55.763
Be here at 7:00, all right?

37:55.787 --> 37:57.598
Look, just... Don't go crazy.

37:57.622 --> 37:59.141
We'll start you out
one night a week.

37:59.165 --> 38:01.102
We'll see how you
work out, okay?

38:01.126 --> 38:02.979
You can date anybody you want,

38:03.003 --> 38:05.273
only not on the job,
you understand?

38:05.297 --> 38:06.274
- Mm-hmm.
- You hearing me?

38:06.298 --> 38:08.276
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, any problems,

38:08.300 --> 38:10.027
anybody, like, I don't know,

38:10.051 --> 38:11.779
slaps you on the ass, whatever,

38:11.803 --> 38:13.948
just take a self-defense course.

38:13.972 --> 38:15.408
It'll come in handy.

38:15.432 --> 38:18.202
Um, ask one of the other
girls about tips.

38:18.226 --> 38:19.662
Got it?

38:19.686 --> 38:20.663
Got it.

38:20.687 --> 38:22.280
Good.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.241
Yes.

38:35.076 --> 38:36.878
My parents are
starting to worry.

38:37.037 --> 38:39.047
They think you're
casing the house.

38:39.664 --> 38:41.090
What do you want, Charlie?

38:41.833 --> 38:43.593
Doesn't this look
like an apology?

38:43.752 --> 38:45.178
No.

38:46.338 --> 38:49.599
Well, I never was very good at those.
That's what it's supposed to be.

38:57.515 --> 38:59.359
What's the point?

38:59.392 --> 39:01.903
You kind of showed
your true colors, huh?

39:02.896 --> 39:04.373
Oh, come on.

39:04.397 --> 39:07.200
No. At the very least, I
thought you were a friend.

39:07.233 --> 39:09.744
Hey, give me a break.
You slept with me, too.

39:10.403 --> 39:12.757
Right. You're right.

39:12.781 --> 39:14.957
It's just as much my
fault as it is yours.

39:17.410 --> 39:20.838
The thing is, I did need you.

39:22.123 --> 39:23.559
You needed someone.

39:23.583 --> 39:24.926
No.

39:25.085 --> 39:26.761
I needed you.

39:27.962 --> 39:30.775
I really needed you
to care about me,

39:30.799 --> 39:32.318
to look at me

39:32.342 --> 39:34.977
like there was no one
else in all the world.

39:39.599 --> 39:41.776
I thought that's
what I was doing.

39:43.019 --> 39:46.155
You just run scared so fast
from anything that matters.

39:48.733 --> 39:50.952
I have this image of you

39:51.236 --> 39:53.871
making love with your
fingers crossed.

39:55.865 --> 39:57.542
I don't think that's true.

39:58.368 --> 40:00.086
Charlie...

40:00.787 --> 40:03.172
you're the same guy you
were in high school.

40:03.873 --> 40:07.009
As soon as you got what you wanted,
you didn't want it anymore.

40:10.505 --> 40:11.848
This, um...

40:12.132 --> 40:13.901
This relationship
that you're in now,

40:13.925 --> 40:15.476
she, uh...

40:16.928 --> 40:19.313
She probably does mean
something to you.

40:20.807 --> 40:22.275
Doesn't she?

40:35.238 --> 40:36.873
Why are you dressed like that?

40:37.323 --> 40:38.634
I got a job.

40:38.658 --> 40:40.302
Where? Vegas?

40:40.326 --> 40:41.554
Just a burger place.

40:41.578 --> 40:43.097
They let you dress like that?

40:43.121 --> 40:44.547
Bigger tips.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.427
I wanted to show you something.

40:58.261 --> 41:00.438
It's when Mom got second...

41:01.764 --> 41:03.399
in the competition.

41:07.812 --> 41:10.239
I kind of thought if I won...

41:12.358 --> 41:14.452
it would make Mom proud.

41:21.451 --> 41:24.378
Mom's proud of you just
playing the violin, Claud.

41:36.466 --> 41:38.559
You think she's watching us?

41:44.349 --> 41:46.317
Sure she is.

41:50.772 --> 41:52.615
She looks so young.

41:53.942 --> 41:55.785
She was 19.

42:00.448 --> 42:02.583
I think she looks
kind of like you.

42:06.162 --> 42:08.214
Without all the makeup.

42:31.145 --> 42:32.748
What are these for?

42:32.772 --> 42:34.490
No reason.

43:24.949 --> 43:27.793
I needed somebody to
help me with my taxes.
