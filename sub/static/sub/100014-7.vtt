01:04.022 --> 01:05.566
You know I didn't do this.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.067
What I know

01:07.109 --> 01:10.154
is you withheld facts
material to this case.

01:10.196 --> 01:13.115
Looked me straight in the eye
and fucking lied.

01:16.035 --> 01:19.997
Because I knew what would happen
if I didn't.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.040
Don't put this on me,

01:21.081 --> 01:22.521
you fucking half-blood
piece of shit.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.507
- Take him downstairs.
- Right.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.154
Log him in.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.157
Former Inspector
Rycroft Philostrate.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.994
Where should I put him?

01:59.036 --> 02:01.205
With the fucking Critch,
where he belongs.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.708
On second thought...

02:04.750 --> 02:07.503
put him in here

02:07.545 --> 02:09.547
with these fine gents.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.520
Too good for us, now, is he?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.319
What's this, then?

02:14.343 --> 02:15.928
Half-blood.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.680
Been passing himself off
as one of us.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.057
You don't say.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.939
Right, then.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.816
Let's us go and have a smoke,
shall we?

02:28.858 --> 02:31.443
- What about them?
- They'll be fine.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.563
Philo! Behind you!

03:18.073 --> 03:20.451
Fuck you!

03:22.494 --> 03:25.122
Ouch.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.973
- Curtis.
- Sir.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.017
Thank you.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.815
This way.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.109
Well, Miss Imogen,

05:17.151 --> 05:21.280
it has been, for me,
a most memorable evening.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.283
It has been for me, too.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.911
I realized today I don't
much like Louisa Pembroke.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.540
In fact, I don't think
I like most anyone I know.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.253
Thank the Martyr you're back.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.464
Afissa, I'm fine.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.466
Afissa.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.764
What has got into you?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.265
The police were here.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.225
- What?
- Your brother is in quite a state.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.435
What?

05:51.477 --> 05:52.895
Everywhere I turn

05:52.936 --> 05:54.980
is scandal.
Now, if it weren't bad enough

05:55.022 --> 05:58.442
that my sister was out in public
on the arm of a Puck,

05:58.484 --> 06:01.737
I now come to learn
that my father gave refuge

06:01.779 --> 06:05.157
to a pregnant Pix tart
in this very house.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.826
Now, I can do nothing
about the latter,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.578
as it is mercifully in the past.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.455
- Oh...
- But as to your predicament, dear,

06:11.497 --> 06:14.083
I can and I will intercede.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.251
Must we go over this again?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.253
Our fate is in his hands.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.255
The price is that I be seen
on his arm.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.051
There must be a limit
to what he can ask of you!

06:27.596 --> 06:31.725
Tomorrow, I intend to negotiate
an end to this madness

06:31.767 --> 06:33.185
on your behalf, dear.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.438
Of course.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.608
And for that,
I would be most grateful.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.236
I'm glad to hear it.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.905
If I didn't know any better,
I'd start to wonder

06:44.947 --> 06:47.574
if you didn't actually enjoy
his company.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.164
What?

06:54.206 --> 06:55.916
Nothing, Miss.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.751
Let's get you up these stairs.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.795
Get you out of that dress.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.551
...think you're gonna fucking
love this, right here.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.177
Come here, then.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.698
Get in there
with your own kind.

07:27.739 --> 07:31.118
Now.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.915
Get him out of here.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.959
Lads.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.885
Well done, mate.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.605
Thanks...

07:59.646 --> 08:04.401
for looking out
for me back there.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.613
I didn't want to see you dead
just yet.

08:11.116 --> 08:14.411
What the hell are you
doing here?

08:14.453 --> 08:16.413
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.056
I have some news.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.366
There's a rumor that someone's
been arrested for the murders.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.645
Is that so?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.981
I thought you'd be pleased.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.441
You're safe now.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.153
Am I?

08:48.195 --> 08:52.032
Well, unless he can control
the Darkasher from prison.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.993
Or they have the wrong man.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.913
What makes you say that?

08:59.498 --> 09:02.251
All I know is I saw it
come for me.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.922
And that at the moment
of my death,

09:06.964 --> 09:09.675
I'll understand who summoned it.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.513
W-Well, then we...
we must both pray that

09:14.554 --> 09:17.266
your vision was...

09:17.307 --> 09:19.434
was mistaken.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.437
I should go.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.022
Aioffe?

09:27.276 --> 09:30.070
Your husband will be
back home soon.

09:32.364 --> 09:35.117
Be careful.

10:01.935 --> 10:06.857
Uh, sir, 47 stivers, how far
will that take me from the city?

10:06.898 --> 10:11.069
Only to Keranganz,
if you had five more.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.835
Runyon?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.712
Runyon Millworthy?

10:28.754 --> 10:32.632
Horatius Symes, you old rascal.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.676
How long has it been?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.803
I don't know, but it's an age.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.680
Look at you.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.366
Tell me, are you still singing
for your supper?

10:40.390 --> 10:42.893
The stage? Gracious no.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.937
- I'm far more respectable these days.
- Oh.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.939
Educating the Chancellor's son
at Balefire.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.941
Good God.
So what are you doing here?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.485
I'm just back from Hullsbay;

10:51.526 --> 10:55.614
a futile attempt to hire
an Arts & Letters scholar.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.908
- Hang on a mo...
- What?

10:57.949 --> 11:01.620
Didn't you get a rather good
degree from Oppidian?

11:01.661 --> 11:04.915
Horatius, that was
a very long time ago, and I hear

11:04.956 --> 11:08.418
the Breakspear boy
is a nightmare.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.714
Runyon... it's a lot of money.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.652
If they only knew
the mischief unfolding

11:33.693 --> 11:35.320
under their very noses.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.031
Between a Longerbane
and a Breakspear, no less.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.284
The city would spontaneously
burst into flame.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.329
And we would decide
what rose from the ashes.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.375
More talk of an alliance?

11:48.417 --> 11:51.169
My advisors are pressing me to
call for a vote of no confidence

11:51.211 --> 11:53.547
against your father
within the fortnight.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.216
And what?

11:56.258 --> 11:59.052
- You wish me to warn him?
- I wish to warn you.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.012
Your father's regime is waning.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
There's nothing you can do
about that.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.850
You must see to your future now.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.521
And what would you have me be?
A spy?

12:09.563 --> 12:11.690
What would you like to be?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.109
I have no interest in politics.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.819
But politics is the price.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.362
Of what?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.532
Of moments like this.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.456
As lovely as you are,
I can have moments like this

12:27.497 --> 12:29.916
with anyone I please.

12:29.958 --> 12:33.462
Do you even know what this is?

12:33.503 --> 12:37.090
Do you have any idea
what I'm offering you?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.719
Moments like this
are the moments

12:40.760 --> 12:44.473
that change everything.

12:44.514 --> 12:49.144
If you're not careful,
they'll pass you by.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.564
Good day, Master Jonah.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.678
Your mother, I'm so sorry.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.823
And I know how much that library
meant to you. I just...

13:25.847 --> 13:27.849
I can't imagine.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.983
They can't really think
you killed her.

13:40.445 --> 13:44.908
To cover up my secret.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.577
Can't say I blame them, it all
adds up if you think about it.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.205
The headmaster,
the doctor who sheared me,

13:50.247 --> 13:51.706
they all knew the truth
about me.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.833
Still, working with you
all this time,

13:53.875 --> 13:57.796
they should know you.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.340
They thought they did.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.843
I lied to them.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.805
Sometimes there's
no coming back from that.

14:17.566 --> 14:22.070
The Swan. I like it.

14:22.112 --> 14:26.908
And she can do...
"ten knots at full steam."

14:26.950 --> 14:29.244
Yes, and as you can see,
the hold is quite spacious.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.831
At 50 guilders a head,
she'll pay for herself.

14:32.872 --> 14:38.169
After three crossings,
the rest will be profit.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.633
May I ask you something,
Mr. Agreus?

14:43.675 --> 14:45.969
By all means.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.806
Uh, were you yourself
indentured?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.391
For five years.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.352
To a foundry owner
in New Freehold.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.272
The work was hard,
but he was a fair man.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.899
And how did you make
your fortune

14:59.941 --> 15:04.154
from such humble beginnings?

15:04.195 --> 15:06.364
Guilder by guilder...

15:06.406 --> 15:09.909
like anyone else.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.788
You know the saying, "The first
guilder is always the hardest."

15:13.830 --> 15:17.542
Especially for...

15:17.584 --> 15:19.127
Oh, um...

15:19.169 --> 15:21.755
A Puck.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.842
Especially for a Puck.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.811
Tell me,

15:36.853 --> 15:40.565
what does a skipjack
do, exactly?

15:43.985 --> 15:46.071
Oh, I see you've made
some inquiries.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.115
One must always know who one is

15:49.157 --> 15:52.285
entering business with.

15:52.327 --> 15:56.122
Well, a skipjack is one
who tracks workers

15:56.164 --> 15:57.374
that have run away.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.002
Are you saying you...

16:01.044 --> 16:03.672
you hunted your own kind?

16:03.713 --> 16:07.217
Well, they signed the same
contracts that I did.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.135
Even so.

16:09.177 --> 16:13.181
Your own kind.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.392
I won't deny, Mr. Spurnrose,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.352
that in all the years
I plied the trade,

16:17.394 --> 16:19.938
I never came across
another skipjack that wasn't

16:19.979 --> 16:22.732
your own kind.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.947
But you see, I realized
a long time ago

16:28.988 --> 16:33.118
that if I was to find my way
in the world of men,

16:33.159 --> 16:36.871
I'd have to play
by the rules of men.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.959
Mm.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.757
Um...

16:47.799 --> 16:51.052
there's another matter
I'd discuss with you

16:51.094 --> 16:53.304
concerning my sister,

16:53.346 --> 16:58.101
and the terms
of your arrangement with her.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.523
Well, what did he say?

17:03.565 --> 17:06.901
It is as you surmised
the other day.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.445
That is, not until
you've helped him establish

17:09.487 --> 17:12.615
a foothold
in our social circle will...

17:12.656 --> 17:15.535
will you be free
of your obligation to him.

17:18.121 --> 17:21.458
Well...

17:21.499 --> 17:25.170
judging from the reaction
to his presence at the auction,

17:25.211 --> 17:27.922
that could be a very
long time indeed.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.843
Actually,
you'll be happy to hear

17:31.885 --> 17:35.180
Mr. Agreus has received
an invitation to take tea

17:35.221 --> 17:39.058
at the Tripplethorns'
this very afternoon.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.977
- Really?
- Mm.

17:41.019 --> 17:44.981
Apparently, they insisted
on turning over the painting

17:45.023 --> 17:47.233
he bid on personally.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.278
It seems they're
very curious to know more

17:50.320 --> 17:53.156
about our mysterious
Puck neighbor.

17:53.198 --> 17:56.659
It could very well be
that your services

17:56.701 --> 17:59.454
are no longer be required
soon enough,

17:59.496 --> 18:02.707
if at all again, dear.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.543
Well, we can only hope.

18:05.585 --> 18:10.048
We can. We truly can.

18:22.477 --> 18:27.023
Oi, Fleury,
have you seen Vignette?

18:28.191 --> 18:29.275
Something the matter?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.778
She didn't come home last night.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.655
Hmm.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.662
So she is in custody?

18:40.703 --> 18:42.080
That's what I just said,
isn't it?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.998
She in a lot of trouble?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.084
Well, that's up
to the magistrate.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.669
If he's in a bad mood,

18:47.710 --> 18:49.504
she'll get sent
back where she came from.

18:49.546 --> 18:53.508
But if she's lucky,
she'll just have to pay a fine.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.011
How big a fine?
I'll pay.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.893
That way you won't have to
trouble the magistrate at all.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.689
Come back tomorrow
with 50 guilders.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.232
Fifty?

19:11.234 --> 19:13.611
I'll see what I can do.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.946
Well, there you go.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.202
- Sarge, I'm gonna have a smoke.
- Yeah, all right.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.288
Oh.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.623
Good afternoon, Mrs. Fyfe.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.208
I've come to see about Philo.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.460
Ah. Over here.

19:32.005 --> 19:35.675
Well, be assured
Inspector Philostrate

19:35.717 --> 19:38.928
has been arrested and charged.

19:38.970 --> 19:42.098
You didn't say anything about
charging him when we spoke.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.017
Well, passing is a crime.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.102
You're not the first
decent citizen

19:46.144 --> 19:47.687
to have been deceived like that.

19:47.729 --> 19:51.941
Besides, that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.818
We've got him
for the killings, too.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.363
What?

19:57.405 --> 19:58.781
No.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.659
M-Mr. Philostrate
isn't a murderer.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.328
I don't need to tell you that.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.121
You've worked alongside him
for years.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.707
How much does one really know
about a Critch, eh?

20:13.212 --> 20:16.966
Yours was the piece
that made the puzzle.

20:17.008 --> 20:21.054
It all fell into place once you
put us onto him

20:21.095 --> 20:23.097
being a half-blood.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.102
It was a lie.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.898
- Come again?
- We had a quarrel.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.026
I made it all up to hurt him.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.933
Philo.

21:06.975 --> 21:09.644
Your landlady just filed
a statement

21:09.686 --> 21:12.605
that could potentially
see you clear of this mess.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.166
You said you didn't
do these killings.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.210
You know I didn't.

21:34.252 --> 21:37.046
- Not Morange?
- No.

21:37.088 --> 21:40.758
- Not the headmaster?
- No.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.510
Or the Pix, Aisling Querelle?

21:44.595 --> 21:46.222
No.

21:46.264 --> 21:50.351
So it's not true
that you're her son, then?

21:50.393 --> 21:52.270
That was just something
the Fyfe woman made up

21:52.311 --> 21:54.230
because of a quarrel?

22:18.629 --> 22:22.425
I need to hear it
from your own mouth

22:22.467 --> 22:25.428
that you're a man...

22:25.470 --> 22:28.681
not some lying half-blood.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.772
Go on, then.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.732
Answer me.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.997
Aisling Querelle was my mother.

22:56.459 --> 23:00.129
I am what I am.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.470
The Darkasher's
still out there.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.681
Enough of your half-blood shit!

23:10.723 --> 23:13.851
I trusted you!

23:13.893 --> 23:16.145
I believed in you!

23:58.980 --> 24:02.859
I understand
Master Symes left you

24:02.900 --> 24:06.279
at Chapter 39 of Elomia.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.073
Open it and let's begin.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.284
No. I don't think
I'm in the mood.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.702
Be that as it may,

24:12.743 --> 24:14.412
I've been brought in
to tutor you,

24:14.453 --> 24:18.457
and I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to insist.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.419
You're in no position
to insist on anything.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.088
I can tell from your shoes.

24:27.175 --> 24:31.637
You need this job. Hmm? Badly.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.724
Which means you'll confirm
my attendance to Master Symes,

24:34.765 --> 24:36.525
and report that I'm making
splendid progress.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.521
And if I don't?

24:40.563 --> 24:42.940
Well, I'll tell Symes
you're a shite tutor

24:42.982 --> 24:44.567
and to get me someone else.

24:44.609 --> 24:47.570
Are we clear?

24:49.197 --> 24:51.866
Good.
I'll see you here tomorrow.

24:53.201 --> 24:56.329
Oh, don't look so glum.

24:56.370 --> 25:00.416
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.462
I know your type.

25:04.503 --> 25:08.925
Skating along on Daddy's wealth

25:08.966 --> 25:10.635
and good name
without a thought as to how

25:10.676 --> 25:13.304
that story would end.

25:13.346 --> 25:17.183
I've been brought in to
equip you with a little wisdom

25:17.225 --> 25:20.645
so you might vaguely become
a more tolerable human being.

25:20.686 --> 25:25.024
Take it or leave it,
but don't think

25:25.066 --> 25:30.488
you can pay me to lie for you.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.531
Because I don't care
about your father.

25:32.573 --> 25:37.453
And I'm not afraid
of destitution.

25:37.495 --> 25:41.457
But I think you are.

25:41.499 --> 25:47.171
So, it's time to look
to your own future, boy,

25:47.213 --> 25:49.590
if you're to have one at all.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.387
You're not like my other tutors,
are you?

25:54.428 --> 25:57.473
If only you knew

25:57.515 --> 26:02.270
what I'd seen and done.

26:12.071 --> 26:16.117
Good. Chapter 39.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.287
All I'm saying is
it makes us look bad.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.830
One of us a killer.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.707
Well, imagine the trial.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.309
They're gonna drag us all
through the mud

26:24.333 --> 26:26.711
- for not catching onto him sooner.
- Exactly.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.755
Don't know about you boys,
but I've worked too long

26:29.797 --> 26:31.566
and too fucking hard
to see my reputation undone

26:31.590 --> 26:32.758
by one bad apple.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.469
Well, there's nothing
to be done, is there?

26:35.511 --> 26:37.805
- Man has to have his day in court.
- Does he?

26:37.847 --> 26:40.433
What are you getting at?

26:40.474 --> 26:43.561
Well, what if, say,

26:43.602 --> 26:46.063
he tries to escape,
and gets shot for his troubles?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.982
- Oh...
- All right, all right, all right.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.655
Maybe...

26:54.697 --> 26:57.992
the horror of what he has done
gets to him,

26:58.034 --> 26:59.785
and he hangs himself
in his cell.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.454
It could happen.

27:01.495 --> 27:04.623
Now, either way, no messy trial.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.500
Let it percolate.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.545
Let it percolate.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.976
Philo.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.660
I just wanted to say

27:41.702 --> 27:44.872
you did your mother proud
back there.

27:50.378 --> 27:52.880
I just wish I could have
given her justice.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.383
I was getting so close.

27:59.387 --> 28:01.305
I always wondered
who my father was.

28:02.973 --> 28:04.600
If he was soldier, a poet.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.227
Now I know he was
just a piece of shit.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.689
You think it was your father
who did these killings?

28:10.731 --> 28:13.401
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.114
They all knew about me.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.366
His half-fae bastard.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.618
Don't say that.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.120
He's the bastard.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.622
One with a fuck lot to lose
to go as far as to kill

28:26.664 --> 28:31.001
three innocent people just
to protect his own reputation.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.338
What I can't understand is why

28:34.380 --> 28:36.966
he didn't come after me first.

28:37.007 --> 28:40.219
Why didn't that thing kill me
in the tunnel the other night?

28:43.889 --> 28:45.850
Unless...

28:45.891 --> 28:47.893
Unless what?

28:51.564 --> 28:55.526
Unless he didn't know who I was.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.654
That's why he needed
their livers.

28:58.696 --> 29:03.075
So he could read their secrets
and follow them to me.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.745
Then it's not over.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.791
Sooner or later, he's gonna send
that thing after you, too.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.670
Unless they hang me first.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.130
Philo.

29:19.842 --> 29:20.801
Berwick.

29:20.843 --> 29:23.137
Watch yourself.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.514
Dombey's out to make sure
you don't see a trial.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.558
He's gonna try something.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.270
You're a good man.

29:33.147 --> 29:36.025
Sorry I couldn't do more
for you, mate.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.110
I know.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.685
The Rising.

30:21.445 --> 30:24.615
Well, what do you think, Fergus?

30:24.657 --> 30:28.369
Well, it's not how
I'd spend 300,000 guilder.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.539
But then you're
the master here, not I.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.376
Right.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.671
Where to hang it?

30:38.712 --> 30:40.756
Perhaps a woman's eye
would be of some help.

30:44.343 --> 30:49.056
I was out for a stroll,
and I saw you bringing it in.

30:49.098 --> 30:52.851
A woman's eye would be
most welcome.

30:54.937 --> 30:56.897
Just up a little on the right.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.859
Perfect.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.338
Thank you. It's perfect there.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.382
I think so.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.971
What was he trying to say,
I wonder?

31:29.013 --> 31:31.390
The painter.

31:31.432 --> 31:37.021
That we're all poised somewhere
between heaven and hell,

31:37.062 --> 31:39.732
I suppose.

31:39.773 --> 31:42.651
Do you think she's meant
to be an angel, then?

31:42.693 --> 31:45.863
Well, she's got the wings
for it.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.865
And he a demon?

31:47.906 --> 31:50.117
He's certainly
got the horns for it.

31:54.413 --> 31:58.876
But he's an odd sort of demon,
though, isn't he?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.878
You know, pulling heavenward.

32:00.919 --> 32:05.090
Yes, it is
topsy-turvy, isn't it?

32:05.132 --> 32:07.551
Maybe he's not a demon
after all.

32:09.762 --> 32:14.350
But those horns.
What else could he be?

32:17.478 --> 32:19.938
A rescuer.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.656
From what?

32:28.697 --> 32:31.325
The ordinary.

32:36.538 --> 32:39.375
As if you, Miss Spurnrose,
would know the first thing

32:39.416 --> 32:42.169
about being ordinary.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.224
What's that?

32:56.934 --> 32:59.812
This...
This is another

32:59.853 --> 33:03.148
of my prized possessions.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.192
An electric lamp.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.197
How does it work?

33:10.239 --> 33:12.408
Allow me.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.250
What are you doing?

33:21.291 --> 33:23.460
It's called a battery.

33:23.502 --> 33:27.881
Now, that's just water that's
been distilled from steam.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.843
But this is the magic
ingredient.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.094
Huh.

33:34.388 --> 33:35.848
Copper sulfate.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.057
Huh.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.567
And now what?

33:46.608 --> 33:48.736
Patience.

34:11.467 --> 34:16.138
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

34:16.179 --> 34:20.350
You know, I told myself you
were just another conquest,

34:20.391 --> 34:22.018
like any other...

34:23.603 --> 34:24.831
...but I walked away
feeling as though

34:24.855 --> 34:27.065
it was I who had been conquered.

34:28.859 --> 34:32.612
I've spent all day
asking myself why.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.618
Something's changed in me.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.953
You've taken me
to the edge of something

34:39.995 --> 34:41.413
I can no longer ignore.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.792
What's that?

34:44.833 --> 34:48.212
The future.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.255
I-I'd never bothered
to imagine it before.

34:50.297 --> 34:53.717
It... it didn't belong to me.
It belonged to...

34:53.759 --> 34:58.055
prophecies
and broken promises and...

35:00.098 --> 35:03.060
Until the day a stranger
came to Parliament.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.688
She was nothing
when she walked in.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.691
No one expected anything of her.

35:09.733 --> 35:13.946
But within five minutes,
she brought my father,

35:13.987 --> 35:19.535
the Chancellor of the Burgue,
to his knees.

35:21.829 --> 35:23.789
And?

35:23.831 --> 35:26.250
Aren't you going to ask?

35:26.291 --> 35:28.502
Ask what?

35:28.544 --> 35:31.839
The question
you came here to ask me.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.175
Why?

35:37.219 --> 35:41.139
- Chaos.
- Chaos?

35:41.181 --> 35:42.766
Oh, yes.

35:42.808 --> 35:47.229
Chaos is the great hope
of those in the shadows.

35:47.271 --> 35:50.482
Chaos to a man like your father
creates opportunity

35:50.524 --> 35:52.568
for people like you and me.

35:52.609 --> 35:55.028
Regimes fall,

35:55.070 --> 35:59.241
old worlds burn.

35:59.283 --> 36:02.244
And we decide what rises
from the ashes.

36:04.288 --> 36:06.498
One step at a time.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.632
It's very pretty.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.927
But, honestly,
doesn't a gas lamp

36:18.969 --> 36:21.179
do much the same
but with less fuss?

36:23.015 --> 36:25.726
Well, that may be
the case now, but,

36:25.767 --> 36:29.521
I mean, someday, the streets
will be lined with wires

36:29.563 --> 36:32.065
bringing electricity
from distant steam plants.

36:32.107 --> 36:35.319
There will be no smoke,
no accidental fires.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.154
You'll just throw a switch,

36:37.195 --> 36:40.073
and the light will chase away
the darkness.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.077
Or at least
that's how I like to think

36:44.119 --> 36:47.915
that things will someday be.

36:47.956 --> 36:52.002
Being forward-thinking
is a good thing.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.255
Sometimes it's
a necessary thing.

36:58.091 --> 37:01.345
Is that how you do it?

37:01.386 --> 37:05.098
Ignore the looks
and the slights?

37:05.140 --> 37:07.476
By imagining the day

37:07.517 --> 37:09.203
when the sight of a Puck
on Finistere Crossing

37:09.227 --> 37:13.815
attracts notice
not for the cut of his coat

37:13.857 --> 37:15.901
but for that of his heart?

37:21.323 --> 37:24.910
And I thought
you deemed me vain.

37:24.952 --> 37:26.536
Ridiculous, even.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.704
No.

37:33.710 --> 37:37.631
I did at first, I admit.

37:38.882 --> 37:42.594
But now I see how wrong I was.

37:42.636 --> 37:48.475
You are quite unlike anyone
I have ever met, Mr. Agreus.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.846
This was brought
here from Puyan

41:12.888 --> 41:15.432
by the prior
who founded this place.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.646
He salvaged it
from the Great Hoff...

41:21.688 --> 41:23.398
when the Burguish Army razed it.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.786
He wanted to
make sure the old ways

41:36.828 --> 41:39.789
would never be forgotten here.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.875
The Hidden One brought you
to this place

41:41.917 --> 41:45.170
because He has
a purpose for you.

41:45.212 --> 41:47.172
Tell me.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.509
Well, first, you must
prove yourself to Him.

42:01.436 --> 42:02.896
Oh!

42:10.820 --> 42:12.781
Oh, no. No.

42:16.159 --> 42:18.387
They've raised their
hands against us for too long.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.372
Now it's our turn.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.541
Blood for blood.

42:31.258 --> 42:32.759
No, please.

42:32.801 --> 42:34.636
I... Please.

42:34.678 --> 42:37.681
Please. I've got a family.

42:39.057 --> 42:42.102
Please.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.568
Oh. Oh, no...

42:50.610 --> 42:51.653
Oh.

42:53.405 --> 42:54.823
Oh.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.743
Please.

42:58.785 --> 43:01.579
I've got a wife.
I've got, I've got chil...

43:16.928 --> 43:19.389
The farm workers in
Allora have gone on strike.

43:19.431 --> 43:20.849
Send in the Guard, what else?

43:20.890 --> 43:22.767
Polls from the third ward
show Wootenvale

43:22.809 --> 43:24.352
within striking distance.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.063
Oh, schedule me an appearance
at his next rally.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.940
See if we can't
close the gap. What else?

43:28.982 --> 43:32.068
- Longerbane's coalition...
- Good news, Winetrout.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.654
If there is any.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.257
The constabulary
has a suspect in custody

43:36.281 --> 43:37.741
for the recent spate of murders.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.909
There we are. See?
That wasn't that hard.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.704
Culprit is a half-blood,
it turns out.

43:42.746 --> 43:44.414
The killings
were to keep his secret.

43:44.456 --> 43:47.167
The murdered Pix
was his own mother, I'm told.

43:47.208 --> 43:49.502
- Sordid business.
- Aisling somebody...

43:49.544 --> 43:51.046
A songstress of some sort.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.383
That's the first I've heard
of a murdered Pix.

43:55.425 --> 43:56.843
Well, why would you have?

43:56.885 --> 43:58.386
Uh... Yes, indeed.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.847
When does he hang?

44:00.889 --> 44:02.807
Sooner the better, I'd say.

44:09.314 --> 44:12.275
I was feeling like I'd finally
found a place in this city.

44:14.194 --> 44:15.737
That's when I saw the sign.

44:15.779 --> 44:17.447
Treasures of Tirnanoc.

44:20.492 --> 44:23.495
Everything I'd lived
and breathed for,

44:23.536 --> 44:26.706
that I'd spent my entire life
trying so hard to protect...

44:26.748 --> 44:29.209
put into glass boxes

44:29.250 --> 44:31.836
for a bunch of idiots
to gawk at.

44:31.878 --> 44:34.756
Like some fucking
circus sideshow.

44:51.481 --> 44:53.733
Do you ever
think about Tirnanoc?

44:57.779 --> 44:59.739
All the time.

45:03.076 --> 45:05.495
I wish I'd never left you.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.416
Oh, Philo...

45:11.709 --> 45:14.087
...how did we get so lost?

45:15.130 --> 45:17.048
We're not.

45:19.509 --> 45:22.470
We're found.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.389
Transfer order...

45:24.431 --> 45:26.558
for Rycroft Philostrate.

45:28.685 --> 45:30.437
- They're coming for you.
- I know.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.481
- No, what...
- Stay with me.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.694
- Stay with me.
- Philo...

45:37.735 --> 45:39.529
Stay with me.

45:39.571 --> 45:42.490
- Stay with me.
- Get off him.

45:42.532 --> 45:44.468
- Get off him. Get off him.
- Stay with me.

45:44.492 --> 45:46.953
Let go of him. Let go of him!

45:46.995 --> 45:48.913
- Please, Philo.
- I love you.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.001
Wait.

45:53.042 --> 45:55.295
Get your hands off him.
Come back.

45:55.336 --> 45:57.088
Wait. Wait.

45:57.130 --> 45:58.715
Please.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.551
Where are you taking him?
Philo...

46:03.720 --> 46:05.597
Philo.

46:10.059 --> 46:12.020
No...

46:13.305 --> 46:19.511
