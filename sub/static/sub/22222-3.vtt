WEBVTT

00:04.755 --> 00:08.623
D'Argo:
Why the hezmana don't we just
jettison this thing into frelling space?

00:08.718 --> 00:11.676
Crichton. First he wants to
question these creatures,

00:11.762 --> 00:14.219
then he wants to bury them.

00:14.307 --> 00:18.175
I mean, why don't we just open
the last chamber and ask them
where Earth is?

00:18.269 --> 00:22.182
And then he'll die in the
first thirty microts like
this one did.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.185
Well, death isn't always
a bad thing, Aeryn.

00:25.276 --> 00:29.269
Who wants to live when your
place in the universe
has been suspended?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.103
Jothee and Chiana are
just kids, D'Argo.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.236
I don't want to discuss it.

00:34.327 --> 00:36.113
They were rebelling,
they weren't trying to...

00:36.204 --> 00:38.115
Rebelling?

00:38.206 --> 00:41.118
Rebelling is smoking some galla
root. Rebelling is not
sleeping with...

00:41.209 --> 00:43.120
Aghhl Aghh!

00:43.211 --> 00:46.294
Aghh! Trasta jutu das!

00:48.132 --> 00:51.374
Look, D'Argo, if you
want to talk...

00:53.304 --> 00:55.340
I'm not ready.

01:00.061 --> 01:02.268
Now that ship, I'd like
to jettison.

01:02.355 --> 01:04.311
What if there's some weapon
aboard that we could use?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.810
What if the next system we
set off destroys us all?

01:06.901 --> 01:08.687
We're already destroyed, Aeryn.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.520
It's just that some of us
don't know it yet.

01:45.106 --> 01:50.317
Pilot:
I am as concerned about Zhaan's
welfare as you, Commander. However...

01:50.403 --> 01:53.270
Crichton:
Stark says we've got to get her
in the ground soon.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.525
How long?

01:55.616 --> 02:02.363
A planet meeting Zhaan's
atmospheric requirements is
less than an am away.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.412
So hetch it up, baby.
Come on, let's go.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.994
I simply thought you'd like to
see this before it went away.

02:09.088 --> 02:10.248
What?

02:19.265 --> 02:21.426
Holy...

02:22.393 --> 02:24.349
Pilot, take readings.

02:24.437 --> 02:27.600
Complete spectrum roll, diffuse
electron analysis across the
electromagnetic range.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.727
It's only theoretical but look
for a dimensional bend in
the halo effect.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.433
Commander?
-I know, I know. Zhaan.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.610
Look, scan on the
parabolic curve.

02:34.697 --> 02:37.279
Give me a chance to dip in for
some readings. Prepare to
launch my module.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.526
Commander.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.279
Pilot! My call.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.988
There's a ship approaching,
I... lthink.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.071
Where?

02:46.167 --> 02:48.203
Not sure. These readings
can't be.

02:48.294 --> 02:50.831
Pilot, save the golly-gee-whiz
for later. Just tell me
where it is.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.422
It's traveling too fast.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.292
Too... impossible.

02:54.383 --> 02:58.046
All right, so far I've got "not
sure", "can't be" and
"impossible".

02:58.137 --> 02:59.343
Where the hell is it?

02:59.430 --> 03:01.421
Up there!

03:04.393 --> 03:07.100
Pilot, Starburst!

03:12.818 --> 03:15.150
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

03:15.237 --> 03:19.196
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

03:19.283 --> 03:20.614
I'm trying to stay alive...

03:20.701 --> 03:22.612
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

03:22.703 --> 03:25.410
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.204
If you can hear me...
Beware.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.282
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

03:29.377 --> 03:32.084
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

03:32.171 --> 03:36.380
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.799
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

03:38.886 --> 03:41.377
Not show them...
You exist...

03:41.472 --> 03:45.431
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.138
Pilot?

04:31.439 --> 04:33.054
Pilot!

04:34.525 --> 04:37.267
That ain't part of Moya.
What the hell!

04:37.361 --> 04:40.194
Aeryn! D'Argol Zhaan! Pilot!

04:40.281 --> 04:43.398
Pilot:
Commander! What did we...

04:43.492 --> 04:46.575
I don't know, some kind of
collision. You okay?

04:46.662 --> 04:49.119
Moya and l are...

04:49.206 --> 04:51.322
hard to think.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.282
Aghhh...

04:53.377 --> 04:55.413
Kreetago:
Neeyala!

04:55.504 --> 04:58.337
We have extensive damage...

05:00.885 --> 05:03.092
Alien penetration of
our vessel!

05:03.179 --> 05:05.340
Neeyala:
An impact during
phase resolution.

05:05.431 --> 05:07.467
What the hell did you
do to Moya?

05:07.558 --> 05:09.423
We must maintain integrity
as prescribed.

05:09.518 --> 05:14.182
Aeryn:
Crichton, my comms aren't
work... What did you do?!

05:14.273 --> 05:16.264
Get down on the ground now!
Get down on the ground!
-Aeryn! Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it!

05:16.358 --> 05:19.100
I don't think they understand
what we're saying.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.902
Zhaan:
Dear goddess, help!
Moya's in agony!

05:21.989 --> 05:23.104
Someone answer!

05:23.199 --> 05:25.736
Tier Three is dark!
Ruptures everywhere!

05:25.826 --> 05:27.327
Zhaan, D'Argo, you guys okay?

05:27.411 --> 05:29.072
lam, but Moya is frelled.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.653
Anyone hear from Aeryn?

05:30.748 --> 05:33.364
What about me?
No one asks about me.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.324
(warbling roar)
-Oh.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.125
Crichton:
Listen, Pilot's not in
too good a shape.

05:37.213 --> 05:38.453
Is anybody nearby?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.457
I'm on my way.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.879
I'll meet you.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.582
So many different tongues,
yet they communicate.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.168
Pip, you still there?
-Tier Six is a total loss.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.514
A Consortium.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.088
Sparky, go help her.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.845
Doesn't simply shooting them
dead strike you as viable?

05:51.936 --> 05:52.641
Just go!

05:52.728 --> 05:53.934
(grunts)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.057
DRD, Translator Microbes.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.268
They've injected me
with something!

06:02.363 --> 06:04.479
Fight while you have strength!

06:04.573 --> 06:06.985
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Stop, please!

06:07.076 --> 06:08.156
Just wait!

06:08.244 --> 06:10.405
Wait... just...

06:12.081 --> 06:14.618
My name is John Crichton,
can you understand me?

06:17.795 --> 06:21.253
He speaks and l comprehend...

06:22.341 --> 06:24.548
They have altered your mind.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.757
I am Pathfinder Neeyala,

06:28.847 --> 06:33.341
commanding research vessel
Rado Slana.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.680
I don't know what's wrong.

06:39.775 --> 06:42.107
I don't know what's
happening to us.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.061
All right, just calm down Pilot,
and tell us how you feel.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.020
Well, | feel... aghh!

06:47.116 --> 06:49.858
Ohh! Ohh!

06:49.952 --> 06:52.284
D'Argo:
I had no idea that
he could do that.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.784
I had no idea anyone
could do that!

06:55.874 --> 06:57.956
I apologize.

06:58.043 --> 07:02.662
Colors, lights, sensations.
This region of space...

07:02.756 --> 07:06.248
I cannot function under
the bombardments.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.880
Can we isolate you from
the stimuli?

07:08.971 --> 07:10.256
Neural clusters...

07:10.347 --> 07:12.804
containment nexus circuitry...

07:12.891 --> 07:14.097
Reroute it?

07:14.184 --> 07:15.344
Dis...

07:15.436 --> 07:16.221
Buffer the leads?

07:16.312 --> 07:17.051
Dis...

07:17.146 --> 07:18.226
Both:
What?!

07:18.314 --> 07:20.179
Disconnect!
-Right!

07:25.362 --> 07:28.604
Neeyala:
We were regaining dimensionality
when our ships collided

07:28.699 --> 07:34.069
and must've been subjected to
a massive burst of
photonic distortion.

07:34.163 --> 07:37.326
Once the Phaztillon Generator is
repaired, we'll dose ourselves

07:37.416 --> 07:43.002
and hope your living ship
doesn't interfere with
non-thermal dimensional forces.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.828
Do you understand any
of those words?

07:44.923 --> 07:48.256
Yeah, I watched all kinds of
Star Trek. It's just the order
that they're in.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.961
You said you studied wormholes?

07:52.056 --> 07:55.014
More trickery, Neeyala.
Of course they would say...

07:55.100 --> 07:57.091
You can shut the frell up,
I think.

07:57.186 --> 08:00.974
Because if you're not going to
take the Translator Microbes,
you don't participate.

08:01.065 --> 08:02.771
Tell him that.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.689
Neeyala:
You have seen our
research vessel.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.768
If we are to trust
each other...

08:06.862 --> 08:09.399
Yes, I'll take him
around our ship.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.605
Right.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.609
Come on.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.156
Crichton:
So, keep it simple.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.744
How do we get the ships apart?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.284
Neeyala:
Display.

08:16.372 --> 08:20.991
Wormholes always gravitate
toward each other in
segmented loops.

08:21.085 --> 08:23.667
(low rumbling)

08:23.754 --> 08:27.838
First jolts mean we've exited
one fragment of wormhole...

08:29.259 --> 08:31.671
...and then quickly
into another.

08:31.762 --> 08:35.380
Only this gap is large enough
to permit escape.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.180
And how often do we pass it?

08:37.267 --> 08:38.848
Every third of an arn.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.393
Right. So we'll activate
your phase...

08:41.480 --> 08:42.515
Phaztillon.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.597
...Generator and then
we'll separate.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.648
In theory.

08:46.735 --> 08:51.900
However, we're not even sure
how far into the turbulence
zone this collision threw us.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.776
Say that again?

08:53.867 --> 08:58.782
We've ricocheted into the
distorted region that divides a
wormhole from normal space time.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.157
What?

09:00.249 --> 09:05.243
We... I mean, we're not even
on the fairway?

09:05.337 --> 09:07.168
We're in the rough?

09:36.827 --> 09:38.317
(gasps )

09:38.412 --> 09:40.368
Oh, I didn't mean to startle.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.328
I am to die soon.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.911
The goddess has chosen
my harbinger.

09:49.006 --> 09:54.251
A magnificent planet lies just
out there to rejuvenate and
sustain you.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.926
A serpent lies between.

09:59.475 --> 10:02.182
You're ill. Hallucinations.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.853
Oh, my Stark.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.806
My wonderful Stark.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.483
So afraid to let go.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.990
l have a darkness which
frightens lovers away.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.287
Whenever I assist the dying,

10:23.373 --> 10:28.709
I cannot help but absorb a tiny
spillet of their existence.

10:28.796 --> 10:34.007
Over the cycles, the endless
parade of death,

10:34.092 --> 10:39.086
l have accumulated a vast
reservoir of evil.

10:41.934 --> 10:49.056
I cannot bear to lose the one
thing that mitigates this
twisted core of my existence.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.370
None of what you said
makes any sense.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.869
Stark:
I think he said we're in the
wall of the wormhole.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.667
Well, that's kinda what she
said. Look, we've got
to wake Pilot up.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.120
He has to give a Starburst when
we hit this particular gap.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.376
But can we do that while
joined to another ship?

11:15.467 --> 11:18.800
I'm not sure, but they're dead
in the water, so Moya's gotta
pop us free.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.297
How do we get the
ships separated?

11:20.389 --> 11:21.299
Save that for later.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.676
Colonel Klink, yo,
inspection is over.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.349
Aeryn, I need you to take
Neeyala's countdown.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.143
The rest of us are going to seal
the breaches before Starburst.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.641
l have the Oxillary conduits.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.893
I'll check the Hamman side
hatches on the way to Command.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.771
Move it. Now. Go.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.068
I'll go to Pilot.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.405
I'm close to the
Selticore vents.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.275
And I'll take the cargo bays.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.324
Well, I'm going to need someone
up here with another
pair of hands.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.114
What can I do to help?

11:46.123 --> 11:47.909
Two tiers down,
four chambers across.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.661
Moya's external
pressure senses.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.332
Yank 'em all.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.752
I mean, what can I do about us?

11:53.839 --> 11:57.206
That relationship does
not exist.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.792
We could die. It exists for me.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.345
If you did not want to marry
me, you could have found some
other way to tell me.

12:04.850 --> 12:08.513
When I'm cornered, l... I don't
think clearly.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.517
At least now you're speaking
the truth.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.854
External pressure senses?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.154
Yank 'em all.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.618
I'm kind of in the mood
to be destructive.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.117
(coughing)

12:26.204 --> 12:27.785
What did you do?!

12:27.873 --> 12:30.740
l was checking the hangar.
This started leaking.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.166
It regulates with self-venting!

12:33.253 --> 12:36.211
I tried to close the valve,
but it wouldn't turn.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.289
Because it was already sealed!

12:38.383 --> 12:40.123
Mmm. Then I twisted
the other way.

12:40.218 --> 12:44.257
Rygel, you opened it,
opened it, opened it!

12:44.348 --> 12:46.384
( both gasping )

12:46.475 --> 12:48.466
(grunting)

12:48.560 --> 12:54.726
I'll bet 40 mesots she gurgles
and dies before she can tell
you where Earth is.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.570
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.402
Wake up and die.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.411
Who are you?

13:13.502 --> 13:17.165
My name is John.
Listen, we don't have
much time.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.244
Correct.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.047
Yours is up.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.630
Get...! Don't touch me.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.178
Do you know me? My race?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.178
Sebacean.

13:31.269 --> 13:35.103
Intellectually suited to carry
weapons and die marching
in formation.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.396
Human.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.599
Your species and mine
might be related.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.854
( sarcastic chuckle )

13:39.945 --> 13:41.185
Of course they are.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.191
I have a brother who's a
Stenerian lizard.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.318
Have you ever heard of Earth?

13:46.410 --> 13:52.121
On Trintika Major, the
predorian fly transmits a fatal
rheumatoid disease called Arth.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.744
Uh. Very similar.

13:54.835 --> 13:55.620
(grunts)

13:55.711 --> 13:56.621
The animal speaks?

13:56.712 --> 13:58.998
(angry growl)
Whoa.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.580
What's your name?

14:03.260 --> 14:05.797
Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.799
What do they call you
for short?

14:09.307 --> 14:11.923
My whole name.

14:12.019 --> 14:16.183
Listen, Jool, what's the last
thing you remember?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.772
How long have I been
in this chamber?

14:22.863 --> 14:26.230
Manifest says 22 cycles.

14:26.324 --> 14:30.533
( piercing scream )

14:32.289 --> 14:36.032
Crichton:
Whoa. Whoa. Hey, lady,
dial it down!

14:36.126 --> 14:41.587
We're ready, Crichton. Prepare
to Starburst in five microts.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.415
Aeryn, I can't hear a thing
you're saying.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.000
Aeryn:
Three microts.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.336
One...

14:49.431 --> 14:50.591
It is time.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.843
Starburst.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.641
You die later. Starburst now!

15:04.613 --> 15:06.194
Crichton:
Kill Starburst!

15:06.281 --> 15:08.397
Kill Starburst!

15:20.670 --> 15:22.376
Bad?

15:22.464 --> 15:24.250
Is two of you bad?

15:24.341 --> 15:26.377
That so depends.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.424
Well, it's not bad enough.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.252
You should let Zhaan have
a look at it.

15:30.347 --> 15:34.090
Zhaan does not have much
respect for my head.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.768
You know, it's okay to
be in pain, D'Argo.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.596
But since you're all right,
I'll get back to work.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.305
(grunts)

15:43.443 --> 15:44.979
It's all r...

15:45.070 --> 15:46.731
Crichton:
We're going to have to separate
before we do anything.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.279
Suggestions. Zhaan, you
ought to hear this.

15:49.366 --> 15:53.905
Um, am I wrong or is your
Phaztillon Generator the key?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.781
Correct pronunciation, and yes.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.290
The belief is so.

16:00.377 --> 16:05.462
However, circumstances, you will
attest, are less than conducive.

16:05.549 --> 16:09.918
Zhaan:
Pathfinder Neeyala, if your
crew will not accept Translator Microbes

16:10.011 --> 16:11.797
then I cannot communicate.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.095
If I cannot communicate,
I cannot heal.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.924
Uh, we have rules against
alien exposure.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.555
It is sufficient l have
broken them.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.477
I understand, but under
these extreme...

16:21.565 --> 16:23.021
Shreena:
Pathfinder!

16:23.108 --> 16:25.190
Pathfinder! Help him, please.

16:25.277 --> 16:26.562
His leg. We need help.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.938
Zhaan:
Tell her to follow me.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.566
My lab is the only place
I might heal him.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.154
Besides my people healthy,

16:35.245 --> 16:40.956
I need empirical information
about our position in the
wormhole.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.374
Despite the danger,
would you help?

16:45.755 --> 16:49.088
Can you hear me?

16:49.176 --> 16:53.169
Crichton, stopping Starburst
midway through took everything
out of him.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.128
We need him to get the
hangar doors open.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.135
Right now he can't even
open his eyes.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.968
There's not much else
I can do, Crichton.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.677
Does this negate our plan?

17:02.772 --> 17:05.935
No, it doesn't. I can open the
doors from Pilot's console.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.357
Yes.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.980
May we have a moment?

17:09.070 --> 17:11.231
Oh. Mmm.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.022
Insane.

17:14.117 --> 17:14.981
Since birth.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.031
Suicidal.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.859
Test pilot.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.206
Do you trust her?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.996
If we don't do something,
we're gonna die.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.244
I'm worried you're a little
too excited by all this.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.418
It's wormholes.
That's what Scorpius wants.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.211
Scorpius is dead.
That's what you want.

17:29.299 --> 17:32.336
Aeryn, it could be a tool or a
weapon. Let's get there first.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.464
Let's get there alive, first.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.471
She doesn't like you.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.769
Nah, it's a phase.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.266
It's part of her charm.

17:46.358 --> 17:50.101
I admit to some
skepticism myself.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.651
This way.

17:53.698 --> 17:57.065
My module jams in wormholes.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.368
If this is some kind ofjest...

18:00.455 --> 18:02.867
Just give me the gizmo and
tell me what to do.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.540
Without this data our
assumptions would be
worse, and...

18:05.627 --> 18:09.415
than guesswork.
-Flight times and vectors.
That's all I need.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.167
Zhaan:
Crichton, is Neeyala with you?

18:11.258 --> 18:12.964
Yes, Blue.

18:13.051 --> 18:16.339
Please tell her I couldn't
save Cresto. I'm sorry.

18:19.933 --> 18:25.553
I do appreciate the risk you
take for us, and our families.

18:25.647 --> 18:31.688
We shall return that effort
in selfless kind.

18:31.778 --> 18:37.364
Use this to record as much
positional data inside the
wormhole as you can.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.611
Vharishta...

18:42.706 --> 18:46.494
gailin... gailin...

18:48.378 --> 18:51.120
(wind whooshing)

19:02.350 --> 19:04.181
It's no use.

19:04.269 --> 19:09.138
Even with the isolation D'Argo's
providing, we're traveling too
fast for Pilot to cope.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.223
It's all right.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.401
I know the hangar door
configuration.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.523
( beeping )

19:22.537 --> 19:24.323
Something wrong?

19:25.457 --> 19:27.698
You're very pretty.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.082
But I'm not Zhaan, right?

19:33.173 --> 19:35.164
Never be her.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.214
It's all right, Stark. We're
going to get her out of here

19:37.302 --> 19:40.635
and we're going to put her in
the soil she needs to heal.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.482
( beeping )

19:55.528 --> 20:00.864
Despite your fears,
this must be accomplished.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.113
The generator's leaking
phasic reston ions.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.365
Lethal, Kreetago.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.994
I know what they are,
Researcher.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.087
Expose yourself briefly
as possible.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.669
Accomplish the task Pathfinder
has laid out for you.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.129
May | interdict, Kreetago?

20:24.224 --> 20:26.215
No.

20:26.309 --> 20:30.393
The knowledge this ship has
amassed must be saved.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.974
Even if we die in the process.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.778
I can't believe my
cousins are dead.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.580
Rygel:
They didn't suffer. Much.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.751
Animal, how did they die?

20:54.838 --> 21:00.799
Oh, if you must know, we were
at a surgical facility where
you were all frozen.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.625
Crichton needed a brain...

21:02.720 --> 21:06.008
...storm on how he could
rescue you.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.966
We saved two pods.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.561
One of my cousins survived?

21:10.645 --> 21:12.727
Yeah. For 30 microts.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.146
Then he oozed this...
this black gunk.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.645
We don't know how the other
one died do we, Ryg?

21:17.735 --> 21:18.861
( chuckles )

21:18.945 --> 21:21.231
What is it you're not
telling me?

21:21.322 --> 21:22.653
Well that we're in a
crisis, hairdo,

21:22.740 --> 21:25.402
so you can either help, shut
up, or go back to sleep.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.995
lwon't be spoken to like that
by some... alley whore.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.117
( Rygel laughs)

21:32.208 --> 21:33.789
How could she know
that about you?

21:33.877 --> 21:35.242
(grunts)

21:35.336 --> 21:38.169
Did you know she had a fiance
till she slept with his son?

21:38.256 --> 21:40.713
Buckwheat. You still want to
get off this boat, man?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.132
More than ever.
This creature sheds...

21:43.219 --> 21:46.382
Good, 'cause your Uncle Sam
needs you.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.098
( beeps and trills)

21:51.186 --> 21:54.053
We enter conventional space
within 30 microts.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.765
Once clear, spiral hard,
71 degrees, vector briko.

21:57.859 --> 22:01.067
Crichton:
Roger, copy that.
Thanks for the intel.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.145
This is Farscape One.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.321
Y'all leave the light
on for us.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.252
Wh Rygel:
ats happening?

22:20.340 --> 22:24.583
It's your basic ass-kicking
wormhole, Ryg.
How you doing back there?

22:24.677 --> 22:25.792
Lousy!

22:25.887 --> 22:27.343
Excellent.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.931
Turn on that alien gizmo.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.383
Maximum power.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.068
Are we dead?

22:43.488 --> 22:45.444
Oh, no.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.485
Rygel, you know
what this is?

22:52.580 --> 22:54.195
No.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.407
The Holy Grail.

22:58.503 --> 23:03.998
The zone. We are in the
effin' zone, man.

23:04.092 --> 23:08.131
This is the dirty little secret
of the universe. It all works
if you know how to use it.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.588
Can these things take us home?

23:11.683 --> 23:15.301
In a heartbeat, if you know
where you're going.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.059
(grunts)

23:27.532 --> 23:28.942
Aeryn:
D'Argo.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.323
D'Argo!

23:33.288 --> 23:37.702
Pilot has been unconscious
for over an am now.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.657
Well, why didn't you
stop me earlier?

23:39.752 --> 23:43.119
Well, somehow I have a feeling
this isn't about him anymore.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.923
I'm sorry.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.255
I'm angry with myself because
I could almost forgive her.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.146
Why don't you?

24:04.819 --> 24:07.276
How can I trust Chiana
with my heart?

24:08.656 --> 24:11.068
Can you trust Crichton again?

24:14.746 --> 24:16.782
He trusts these aliens.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.080
We know nothing about them.

24:19.167 --> 24:22.034
I think wormholes blind him.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.996
Well, at least he has a hobby.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.376
Help me keep an eye on it?

24:30.345 --> 24:31.460
Awwwm

24:34.223 --> 24:35.804
What the frell was that?

24:35.892 --> 24:38.634
Zhaan told Stark she
saw a serpent.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.468
She said that it was
an omen for her.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.430
Did it look like that was
aiming for Zhaan?

24:48.529 --> 24:50.440
Wormhole.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.694
Normal space.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.909
Wormhole.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.237
Oh, what are we doing here?

24:59.332 --> 25:01.118
Making 17 loops to their one.

25:01.209 --> 25:04.997
Each time we lap 'em, it
calibrates their position in the
slower wall of the wormhole.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.123
Engrossing.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.795
Who cares?

25:07.882 --> 25:11.795
It's only collecting images,
none of which mean anything.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.298
Well, you got to know how deep
the doo-doo is, Ryg,

25:14.389 --> 25:16.220
if you're gonna dig
your way out.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.263
Next gap is the big one, right?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.181
Yep.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.600
Why don't we just escape?

25:22.855 --> 25:25.267
Does it ever bother you
being selfish?

25:25.358 --> 25:26.313
( laughs )

25:26.401 --> 25:29.814
It's self-preservation, and no.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.405
What about our friends?

25:31.489 --> 25:33.025
What friends?

25:33.116 --> 25:35.072
We were thrown together
against our will,

25:35.159 --> 25:37.070
and we're all just trying
to make the best of it

25:37.161 --> 25:40.653
until we can get the chance
to screw the others and
get what we want.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.830
| vote out at the next gap.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.248
( chuckles )

25:45.253 --> 25:47.369
(sighs)

25:47.463 --> 25:50.455
Pa'u Zotoh...

25:51.509 --> 25:54.091
Hello, Pilot.

25:54.178 --> 25:59.138
Soon you must deploy the
docking web to rescue
Crichton and Rygel.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.261
You are masterful with him.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.809
Zhaan:
I am but a servant.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.148
This you will learn.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.268
I could never replace you.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.941
Stark, you must.

26:11.028 --> 26:15.362
For me, you must remain here,
and minister these souls.

26:15.450 --> 26:18.157
I'm relying on it.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.826
But I love you.

26:20.913 --> 26:27.534
If I did not feel the same, and
more, could I ask this
sacrifice of you?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.664
Aeryn:
Zhaan, I need you to meet
me in Command.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.292
It must wait, Aeryn.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.792
We're about to deploy the
docking web.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.715
No, your omen, the serpent.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.339
Is anyone else meant to see it?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.925
And the big gap.

26:41.017 --> 26:43.099
X clearly marked normal space.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.892
( explosion )
Hey, whoa, whoa!

26:44.979 --> 26:46.344
Get your hands off
those controls.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.351
You have no right to make
decisions for me.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.103
( snarls )

26:51.194 --> 26:52.479
Aghh!

26:52.570 --> 26:54.606
Rygel:
We're free!

26:54.697 --> 26:56.562
Escape! Save our lives!

26:56.657 --> 26:59.034
Crichton:
Guido, we are going back!

26:59.118 --> 27:00.358
Oh!

27:01.412 --> 27:02.948
(groaning)

27:11.964 --> 27:14.046
Son of a bitch.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.124
You broke my nose.

27:16.219 --> 27:19.211
You ain't got a nose, Guido.
You got slits.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.098
Oh!

27:24.185 --> 27:25.391
Farscape One to Moya.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.720
Positive contact with
the docking web.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.101
Hey, nice catch, guys.

27:31.192 --> 27:32.352
(groaning)

27:32.443 --> 27:34.354
I won't forget this, Crichton.

27:34.445 --> 27:37.061
I swear you've attacked me
for the last time.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.488
You brought it on
yourself, Rugrat.

27:39.575 --> 27:43.284
You delay my preparations
for Crichton's data.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.111
The serpent is harmless.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.197
Less than convincing.
Try again.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.156
I never imagined that you would
encounter this beast,

27:49.252 --> 27:51.789
otherwise, I would have issued
warning. You must believe me.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.336
How can we, Neeyala?
Look at what you've done
to our ship.

27:54.423 --> 27:57.335
Oh, what I have done?

28:01.764 --> 28:04.881
It is you who have destroyed
my life's endeavor

28:04.976 --> 28:10.391
whilst I have suffered your
probing, your confusions
and your smell.

28:10.481 --> 28:15.521
Do you not think that my
bristles contain enough poison
to dispatch you all?

28:15.611 --> 28:20.105
Yet when I fail to overload
what are clearly inferior
intellects

28:20.199 --> 28:26.115
with a drist of needless
information, you bring
weapons to bear.

28:26.205 --> 28:30.323
Kill me, if you will.
See how you fare on your own.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.289
Do you feel better?

28:35.339 --> 28:38.331
Now, about the serpent.

28:38.426 --> 28:45.764
The creature you have seen
exists exclusively inside
wormholes.

28:45.850 --> 28:49.968
Corporeal only when the
generator shifts our
phase presence.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.144
Which one would have to
do to repair it.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.313
I doubt it even senses us.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.142
Be less alarmed.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.613
(Jool screaming)
-Shut up! Would you shut up!

28:59.697 --> 29:00.777
Zhaan:
What happened?

29:00.865 --> 29:01.854
There's something really
weird and...

29:01.949 --> 29:03.610
and I tried to shoot when...

29:03.701 --> 29:05.692
Shut up!
-Shut up!

29:05.786 --> 29:08.994
Zhaan:
Neeyala said that the serpent
doesn't even know we're here.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.325
( screaming )
( high-pitched squeal )

29:36.025 --> 29:37.265
I thought you were with Pilot.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.941
I thought you were in
the Neural Cluster.

29:39.028 --> 29:41.269
Filtration's down on Tier One.
You can't even breathe
in there.

29:41.364 --> 29:45.027
Junctions are frying everywhere.
Pilot can't stop it.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.369
Well, you had better tell that
four-armed, bug-eyed,

29:47.453 --> 29:49.739
whiny little slijot to get
his dren together.

29:49.830 --> 29:53.994
It's not him. The stresses on
Moya are frying junctions
everywhere.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.290
She's dying, D'Argo.

29:59.382 --> 30:01.794
The wormhole is killing her.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.265
Do you hope someday to
be Dominar, Rygel?

30:11.352 --> 30:13.308
lam is still Dominar.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.261
Always Dominar.

30:15.356 --> 30:18.689
I mean, ruling from a throne
instead of a throne sled.

30:18.776 --> 30:21.939
They'll never know if
I kill Crichton.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.191
But you will...

30:25.282 --> 30:26.818
( groans )

30:30.121 --> 30:31.861
Fool the others if you like,

30:31.956 --> 30:36.325
but I see the larger goodness
in a small Hynerian.

30:36.419 --> 30:40.287
Separating this alien ship from
Moya must be your first
priority, Rygel.

30:40.381 --> 30:45.216
Have I ever told you that I
appreciate your counsel?

30:48.931 --> 30:51.798
Continuously, by accepting it.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.094
(sighs)

31:06.282 --> 31:10.742
It's amazing the number of
species picked up by
Neeyala's gizmo.

31:14.415 --> 31:17.498
Thousands of cultures spread
out across the galaxy.

31:17.585 --> 31:21.294
I resent you calling me
here at a whim.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.586
That's the way it works, Harvey.

31:25.259 --> 31:27.841
(animal growling)

31:30.014 --> 31:32.300
You think Scorpy's still alive?

31:34.518 --> 31:37.601
Do you think Scorpius
is still alive?

31:37.688 --> 31:39.224
Without doubt.

31:39.315 --> 31:42.148
What's he doing with the
information he stole
from my brain?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.270
The knowledge placed there by
the ancients is by now

31:44.361 --> 31:47.319
centerpiece of a sprawling
new research facility.

31:47.406 --> 31:51.240
If he masters wormhole
technology, what will
he use it for?

31:51.327 --> 31:53.568
Faster delivery of pizzas.

31:55.122 --> 32:00.287
Neeyala thinks it's possible
we can separate the ships.

32:00.377 --> 32:03.084
But only one will survive.
We have to pick which one.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.122
Yes, it's a shame about Moya.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.670
She'll be fondly remembered.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.547
It's not a done deal.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.515
Did you call me here to talk
you out of your guilt?

32:21.607 --> 32:24.349
No.

32:24.443 --> 32:28.152
It's just the information
amassed inside their ship.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.900
No contest.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.981
I sit here inside your
feeble brain

32:32.076 --> 32:34.112
listen to the arguments bounce
off the hollow spaces.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.740
How could you not chose science
over a beast of burden?

32:36.831 --> 32:39.243
You disgust me, John.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.335
I long for the dumpster.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.136
(sighs)

32:52.304 --> 32:54.215
Scorpius:
Pilot and Moya are to die, John.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.844
Take the wormhole knowledge
that's fallen in your lap and
call it a day!

33:05.317 --> 33:07.899
I cannot believe what
I am hearing.
-Facts, D'Argo, that's all.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.318
Zhaan:
How is this even a choice?

33:09.405 --> 33:11.361
Because some of us
want to live!

33:11.448 --> 33:13.109
If we use Starburst to...

33:13.200 --> 33:15.111
What, you didn't get slammed
against the wall hard enough
last time?

33:15.202 --> 33:19.241
So, we recover the data from
the precious ship and
leave in Moya.

33:19.331 --> 33:23.290
Neeyala:
Our craft itself is the
knowledge base repository.

33:23.377 --> 33:26.460
The ship is one giant computer
chip. It's all or nothing.

33:26.547 --> 33:30.335
Zhaan:
Then nothing. We will never
abandon Moya while lam still alive.

33:30.426 --> 33:32.212
Rygel:
Frelling martyr.

33:32.303 --> 33:34.259
(rumbling)

33:34.346 --> 33:36.428
Why not separate in one
of these gaps?

33:36.515 --> 33:41.009
We need the density of the
wormhole wall to help
pull us apart.

33:41.103 --> 33:44.971
Do you have only one
good ear, also?

33:45.065 --> 33:47.397
I'm not dying just because the
ship can eat and crap.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.816
(rumbling)

33:50.779 --> 33:54.772
Okay. So we separate.
What then?

33:54.867 --> 34:01.659
One vessel slides into the
wormhole core, maintaining a
chance of enduring.

34:01.749 --> 34:07.790
The other tumbles uncontrolled
through the wormhole wall
into normal space,

34:07.880 --> 34:12.169
to be atomized by differentials
in speed and density.

34:12.259 --> 34:14.045
Zhaan:
It is still not a choice.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.468
Moya and Pilot are
living beings.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.932
They must be afforded
every opportunity.

34:19.016 --> 34:23.259
Crichton:
Zhaan, the bio-mechanoid parts
on my ship were fried.

34:23.354 --> 34:30.317
Neeyala:
Calculations indicate that your
Leviathan's design will work against her survival.

34:30.402 --> 34:35.362
Forgive me, Pathfinder Neeyala,
but I do not count you
as unbiased.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.155
Hal Like you are.

34:37.243 --> 34:40.735
You know what you and Pilot have
in common besides big eyes?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.239
You're both dying.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.447
And now you want to take us
with you.

34:44.541 --> 34:45.496
Ow!

34:45.584 --> 34:47.324
Can it, F. Lee.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.796
Zhaan, Pilot is unconscious.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.714
Moya's nexus system is so
backed up, the Roto-Rooter man
couldn't get it...

34:53.801 --> 34:55.837
I know the litany, John.

34:55.928 --> 34:59.136
How desperate you must be for
this wormhole knowledge.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.679
Unfair.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.257
You place your obsession above
the lives of your friends.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.683
What?!

35:04.770 --> 35:07.386
What have these strangers done
to so earn your trust?

35:07.481 --> 35:10.097
Zhaan:
We must check for
backup systems.

35:11.443 --> 35:16.904
I need to know that Pilot and
Moya are truly beyond hope.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.365
Let's go.

35:33.299 --> 35:36.917
You want to know what really
happened to your cousin?

35:37.011 --> 35:39.878
What Crichton won't tell you?

35:39.972 --> 35:42.008
(Chiana sobbing)

35:47.438 --> 35:49.394
How you feeling?

35:50.065 --> 35:52.272
You missed the debate.

35:52.359 --> 35:55.442
But that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

35:56.572 --> 35:58.858
| feel guilty.

35:58.949 --> 36:01.235
What possibly for?

36:01.327 --> 36:03.989
l... I love Pilot, and l...

36:04.079 --> 36:09.039
and I love Moya, but I don't
wanna die here.

36:09.126 --> 36:12.118
There's nothing wrong with a
decision of the heart, child.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.499
In the time that is left,

36:15.591 --> 36:19.960
use your mind to satisfy your
soul that it is correct.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.812
Hey, how'd you go?

36:32.900 --> 36:35.642
Well, if it wasn't Moya we
wouldn't be having this
conversation.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.567
Yeah, it's the same everywhere.
Total meltdown.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.360
I'm going to make a run through
the ion-backwash chambers,

36:39.448 --> 36:41.109
see if there's anything
I can do.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.486
Hey. You all right?

36:44.244 --> 36:45.154
No.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.327
(banging)

37:04.223 --> 37:06.134
(electronic wheezing )

37:06.225 --> 37:07.886
What the hell are you doing?

37:07.976 --> 37:09.557
And what happened to your hair?

37:09.645 --> 37:11.306
It's red.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.888
You're not planning to...

37:14.983 --> 37:16.359
(gasps )

37:17.778 --> 37:18.813
Yes.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.519
What the hell are you
trying to do?

37:20.614 --> 37:22.400
You lied to me.

37:22.491 --> 37:28.953
You butchered my cousin's brain
so you could steal a wellot
of his neural fluid?

37:31.792 --> 37:34.625
A member of the
intellectual elite.

37:34.711 --> 37:38.249
Sixteen advanced degrees.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.292
Traded for the likes of you?

37:48.434 --> 37:50.299
Cut it out, lady.

37:50.394 --> 37:55.013
If we're to perish, then
at least you'll die first.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.356
I thought you were good
with women.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.782
lam.

38:06.869 --> 38:08.951
Did you see what happened
when she fired at the ship?

38:09.037 --> 38:12.325
Actually, no. l was looking
at the pulse rifle.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.667
There's a small gap in
the forcefield.

38:20.466 --> 38:24.800
Which, unsurprisingly,
is the key to its access.

38:26.305 --> 38:31.550
Now, John, we're trapped in
this vawn of a wormhole,

38:31.643 --> 38:35.010
Pilot's unconscious,
Moya is dying,

38:35.105 --> 38:38.268
and my son has slept with
my betrothed.

38:39.276 --> 38:42.894
Lock this woman up!

38:50.162 --> 38:51.948
Entreaties, Pathfinder.

38:52.039 --> 38:53.745
Mmmmm

38:53.832 --> 38:58.872
I do not enjoy sending you
to your death, youngling,

38:58.962 --> 39:02.625
but options are depleted.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.089
I want to live.

39:05.177 --> 39:08.510
More important, do you want
your family to live?

39:08.597 --> 39:13.387
You know what happens to ours
should this ship fail
to return.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.358
Will you tell them...

39:20.442 --> 39:23.684
That you thought of them
to the end.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.446
Attention now, Shreena.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.490
Time is limited.

39:30.577 --> 39:34.695
These creatures, I will
distract them.

39:34.790 --> 39:38.408
They must not know your
true mission.

40:05.279 --> 40:06.894
Frell!

40:13.704 --> 40:15.945
Chiana:
I checked this panel,
and it was fine.

40:16.039 --> 40:19.657
But before I had a chance to
close it, it shorted out.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.288
There are dozens more just
like this on this tier.

40:22.379 --> 40:24.335
Rygel:
Then why are we standing here?

40:24.423 --> 40:25.959
That hatch could blow.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.505
Chiana:
He's right.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.925
Functioning DRDs are
overmatched.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.215
There's no way we can
repair all the damage.

40:33.307 --> 40:37.425
Let us not forsake our friends
until we are undeniably
clear that...

40:47.738 --> 40:49.979
Well that settles it then.

40:52.868 --> 40:57.862
We will go with Neeyala and
we will abandon Moya.

41:09.509 --> 41:12.376
I have failed my purpose,
Stark.

41:12.471 --> 41:17.340
You protect, heal, give hope.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.847
This ship and her pilot
are to die.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.429
As do all things.

41:27.527 --> 41:33.147
Once out of the wormhole, you
will heal in the soil of the
fertile planet,

41:33.241 --> 41:38.235
and one day, your gifts will
again help others.

42:02.229 --> 42:04.845
I cannot take you back, Chiana.

42:06.525 --> 42:09.767
But I won't leave you
alone in pain.

42:27.212 --> 42:33.674
Have you ever been responsible
for another's death,
Officer Sun?

42:38.557 --> 42:40.388
Yes, l have.

42:43.437 --> 42:46.053
This is my first time.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.439
Did you know your crew well?

42:54.865 --> 42:58.858
Enough to steel my
determination.

42:58.952 --> 43:02.536
On their memory,
I will not fail.

43:14.259 --> 43:20.300
Crichton:
