08:53.212 --> 08:55.346
Eh-eh-eh-eh-
that's exactly what you said

08:55.381 --> 08:57.182
about "Fucking and Punching,"
word for word.

08:57.216 --> 08:59.483
- And I meant it, Hank.
- Aw!

08:59.518 --> 09:00.585
No, I did.
I did.

09:00.619 --> 09:02.053
It doesn't make it any less true.

09:02.087 --> 09:03.855
All right, well, here's
to bending over and taking it.

09:03.889 --> 09:06.024
- Hollywood style.
- Oh, my God.

09:06.058 --> 09:09.527
And this from the 19th writer
on <i>Santa Monica Cop.</i>

09:09.561 --> 09:12.463
Aah, douche, my friend, douche.

09:12.498 --> 09:14.332
Kiss me, you supercilious fuck.

09:14.367 --> 09:17.035
- So Carrie, I have to ask.
- Yes, Karen.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.905
How did you manage
to nail down Hank for--

09:19.939 --> 09:21.240
- It's a year, right?
- Almost a year, yeah.

09:21.274 --> 09:22.474
Yeah, well, I would
love to say it was me,

09:22.509 --> 09:23.842
but I think it was the sex.

09:23.876 --> 09:24.977
Ahem.

09:25.011 --> 09:27.079
He unleashed
something in me, you know?

09:27.113 --> 09:28.513
Something primal.

09:28.548 --> 09:30.649
Before Hank, it was just me
and that little pink rabbit.

09:30.683 --> 09:32.384
Yeah, where is that pink rabbit today?

09:32.418 --> 09:33.986
Sex toys.

09:34.020 --> 09:35.153
- What's the consensus?
- Oh, my God.

09:35.188 --> 09:36.355
I love them.

09:36.389 --> 09:39.291
Could we just pretend
to talk about politics

09:39.326 --> 09:42.061
or the environment or--
and then, maybe, you know,

09:42.095 --> 09:43.696
end up with sex?

09:43.730 --> 09:44.930
Karen, Karen,
we're all grown-ups here.

09:44.964 --> 09:46.665
- No, we're not.
- Karen hates talking about sex.

09:46.699 --> 09:49.034
- She ain't gonna do it.
- I do not.

09:49.068 --> 09:51.036
Okay, you guys wanna see something?

09:51.070 --> 09:52.170
Here we go.

09:52.205 --> 09:53.171
Sex.

09:53.206 --> 09:54.172
No.

09:54.207 --> 09:55.607
Vagina.
Pussy.

09:55.642 --> 09:57.609
- Aah!
- Big hairy pussy!

09:57.644 --> 09:59.344
[Laughter]

09:59.378 --> 10:01.346
You know what?
I used to be that way.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.848
I did.
I was really closed off.

10:02.882 --> 10:05.317
I was borderline frigid, actually.

10:05.351 --> 10:06.785
- Oh.
- [Groans]

10:06.820 --> 10:09.355
No, no, no, I'm not saying--
but Hank, he opened me up.

10:09.389 --> 10:10.923
- He does--yes, yeah.
- He did.

10:10.958 --> 10:14.493
- Emotionally and creatively.
- Yup, yeah, that's me.

10:14.528 --> 10:16.228
The emotional safecracker.

10:16.263 --> 10:17.563
Well, for what it's worth,

10:17.597 --> 10:18.597
I find Karen to be...

10:18.632 --> 10:20.066
[Whispers] Shut up.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.233
Easily the most sexual woman
I've ever had

10:21.268 --> 10:22.568
the good fortune to copulate with.

10:22.602 --> 10:24.503
- Holy crap.
- Wow, well, that's--

10:24.538 --> 10:25.871
She's quite ferocious, actually.

10:25.906 --> 10:27.172
Like a lioness.

10:27.207 --> 10:29.241
I wanna go and put my head
in the oven.

10:29.276 --> 10:30.642
Will you save room for me?

10:30.677 --> 10:32.211
[Laughter]

10:32.245 --> 10:36.081
The reason I brought this up
was because I like the toys.

10:36.115 --> 10:37.616
- Mm.
- Marcie not so much.

10:37.650 --> 10:38.751
Oh.

10:38.785 --> 10:40.553
It's not that I don't like them, okay?

10:40.587 --> 10:42.889
It's just that the noise
takes me out of the game.

10:42.923 --> 10:44.857
It's that...
[Imitates buzzing]

10:44.892 --> 10:45.858
Or...
[Humming]

10:45.893 --> 10:47.126
Whatever.
[Laughs]

10:47.161 --> 10:51.498
Okay, so I tried
to control the noise factor

10:51.532 --> 10:54.968
by suggesting that perhaps we
incorporate something quieter.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.636
Dildo, perhaps.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.538
Uh, she balks.

10:58.572 --> 11:01.641
Baby, why would I need a dildo
when I have you?

11:01.675 --> 11:03.710
- Well, that's nice.
- That's crazy.

11:03.744 --> 11:06.446
I mean, back
in the Runkle era, however...

11:06.480 --> 11:08.815
[Laughter]

11:08.849 --> 11:11.651
I really could have probably
benefitted from something

11:11.685 --> 11:14.320
with some girth, some--
just fold it over

11:14.354 --> 11:16.155
a couple of times, something!

11:16.189 --> 11:17.490
Don't speak ill of my boy
when he's not here

11:17.524 --> 11:18.524
to defend himself.

11:18.559 --> 11:20.293
Innocent until proven diminutive.

11:20.328 --> 11:21.428
That's what I would say.

11:21.462 --> 11:22.762
You fill me up, baby.

11:22.797 --> 11:24.965
That is exactly how I feel about Hank.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.599
- Oh, Jesus.
- He fills me up.

11:26.634 --> 11:29.736
- Carrie, come on, just--
- What? We're talking.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.972
We're all talking frankly about sex.

11:32.006 --> 11:33.340
Yes, but it's not encounter group.

11:33.374 --> 11:35.509
You don't have to
talk quite so frankly.

11:35.544 --> 11:37.878
That's all right, Carrie,
I'll talk frankly about sex.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.080
Yeah, I'll talk frankly about dildos.

11:39.114 --> 11:40.181
I'm no stranger.

11:40.215 --> 11:42.550
A man's anus is an erogenous zone.

11:42.584 --> 11:43.718
Oh, my God.

11:43.752 --> 11:44.819
There's certainly nothing gay about

11:44.854 --> 11:46.221
having one's prostate stimulated.

11:46.255 --> 11:47.256
Oh, is that right?

11:47.290 --> 11:48.690
Sounds pretty gay to me, Batesy.

11:48.724 --> 11:49.991
Sounds about as gay as Tom Hanks

11:50.026 --> 11:51.592
in a white sailor's outfit.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.094
I don't see it that way, Hank.

11:53.128 --> 11:56.363
You've inserted a dildo
into this man's gaping bunghole?

11:56.398 --> 11:58.265
Oh, you know me.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.433
[Laughter]

11:59.467 --> 12:00.467
I don't know if I'm proud of you

12:00.501 --> 12:02.636
or ashamed or just sad for humanity

12:02.670 --> 12:05.205
or maybe all three, I don't know.

12:05.239 --> 12:06.239
If the truth be known, no she hasn't.

12:06.273 --> 12:07.540
She's not comfortable with it.

12:07.574 --> 12:08.942
Thank you.

12:08.976 --> 12:10.143
And I'm not comfortable
with anything my bride's

12:10.177 --> 12:11.644
not comfortable with.

12:11.679 --> 12:13.313
- That's nice, that's nice.
- Oh, that's nice.

12:13.347 --> 12:14.881
Besides, that was a long time ago.

12:14.915 --> 12:17.017
Boundaries were
pretty blurry back then.

12:17.051 --> 12:18.284
Oh, yeah, that was the gay '90s, huh?

12:18.318 --> 12:19.852
[Whispering] What is wrong with you?

12:19.886 --> 12:21.987
It seems like it was raining
cock back then, was it?

12:22.022 --> 12:23.422
Hey, I would do that for you.

12:23.456 --> 12:26.425
I would stimulate your prostate
with pride and zero prejudice.

12:26.460 --> 12:29.295
That's really sweet of you, thank you.

12:29.329 --> 12:31.230
Oh, come on, Hank.
You've never experimented?

12:31.265 --> 12:34.100
No circle jerks?
No towel snapping incidents?

12:34.134 --> 12:36.936
Sword fights, perhaps?
[Laughs]

12:36.971 --> 12:39.940
♪ Na na na na na na na na ♪

12:39.974 --> 12:44.011
♪ na na na na na na na na ♪

12:44.045 --> 12:46.948
♪ na na na na na na na na ♪

12:46.982 --> 12:50.417
♪ na na na na na na na na ♪

12:50.452 --> 12:53.420

12:53.454 --> 12:55.122

if you're a boy or a girl ♪

12:55.156 --> 12:56.390
That was a pretty big one.

12:56.425 --> 12:57.892
Hm? What?

12:57.926 --> 12:58.893
That silence.

12:58.927 --> 13:02.364
That incredibly awkward silence.

13:02.399 --> 13:03.999
It's our third of the night, you know?

13:04.034 --> 13:05.200
Really?

13:05.235 --> 13:08.104
Uh, I wasn't counting.

13:08.138 --> 13:09.272
But you know what?

13:09.306 --> 13:11.908
I really think awkward silences
get a bad rap.

13:11.943 --> 13:16.980
Because, uh, who really
has that much to say?

13:17.014 --> 13:18.815
Don't worry, you
don't have to make excuses.

13:18.849 --> 13:20.617
- I'm sure it's my fault.
- Don't be silly.

13:20.651 --> 13:21.618
I'm not being silly.

13:21.652 --> 13:23.920
I just--
I'm out of practice.

13:23.954 --> 13:26.389
I haven't been out on a proper date

13:26.423 --> 13:27.857
in a long time.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.058
Tell me about it.

13:29.092 --> 13:30.526
Well, he took me to medieval times,

13:30.561 --> 13:32.461
but the guy was a little handsy.

13:32.496 --> 13:34.730
I mean, he just kept
putting his hand up my skirt

13:34.764 --> 13:37.099
during the jousting,
which would have been fine.

13:37.134 --> 13:40.470
It's just that, you know,
you eat with your hands.

13:40.504 --> 13:43.072
And he'd been really
fingering his chicken.

13:43.107 --> 13:44.073
Okay.

13:44.108 --> 13:46.042
[Laughter]

13:52.050 --> 13:53.251
Four and counting.

13:53.285 --> 13:56.954
Okay, okay, okay,
look, we can just either,

13:56.988 --> 14:00.557
you know, cash in our chips,
go our separate ways right now,

14:00.592 --> 14:03.727
or we can decide to power through

14:03.761 --> 14:05.863
and find some common ground.

14:05.897 --> 14:07.231
- I'm game if you're game.
- Sure!

14:07.265 --> 14:08.699
- What do you say?
- Yeah, I'm game.

14:08.733 --> 14:11.502
- I like your spirit, Charlie.
- Okay.

14:11.536 --> 14:13.671
So how do you know Lizzie?

14:13.705 --> 14:15.139
She's in my book club.

14:15.173 --> 14:17.441
Awesome! Books!
Excellent topic.

14:17.476 --> 14:18.609
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

14:18.643 --> 14:20.211
How do you like to read these days?

14:20.245 --> 14:22.480
Digital age and what not?
Nook? iPad?

14:22.514 --> 14:23.681
I'm a Nook girl!

14:23.715 --> 14:25.516
Okay, well, you're
looking at an iPad guy.

14:25.551 --> 14:26.951
What are you reading right now?

14:26.985 --> 14:29.287
What is on your virtual bookshelf?

14:29.321 --> 14:31.856
Oh, uh, <i>Blood Mountain,</i>
by Richard Bates.

14:31.890 --> 14:33.057
Have you read it?
Oh, my God.

14:33.091 --> 14:34.158
It is so dirty.

14:34.193 --> 14:37.262
I sold the film rights.

14:37.296 --> 14:39.030
You're shitting me.

14:39.064 --> 14:40.632
You know what I think we're
looking at right here, Mary?

14:40.666 --> 14:42.867
I think it's a little something
they call...

14:42.902 --> 14:44.569
common ground.

14:44.603 --> 14:45.737
- Up high.
- Oh!

14:45.771 --> 14:47.139
My hands are a little sweaty.

14:47.173 --> 14:49.508
You know that the average
length of sexual intercourse

14:49.543 --> 14:51.543
is only 2 1/2 minutes.

14:51.577 --> 14:53.345
Yeah, well, that means
nothing when you're tantric.

14:53.379 --> 14:54.546
I'm working on that.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.147
Well, it's a long journey, my friend.

14:56.182 --> 14:57.549
Mm.

14:57.583 --> 14:58.583
Well worth it in the end.

14:58.618 --> 14:59.918
Look, after a couple of decades

14:59.952 --> 15:01.453
with prima-Charlie,
anything longer

15:01.487 --> 15:03.622
than a Ramones song
seems like tantric sex to me.

15:03.656 --> 15:04.823
[Laughs]

15:04.857 --> 15:06.458
I hadn't released a batch in 14 years.

15:06.492 --> 15:08.927
- Ew!
- What's wrong with you?

15:08.961 --> 15:10.128
Nothing.

15:10.162 --> 15:11.496
It happens on the inside.
Tell them, Karen.

15:11.530 --> 15:15.167
- I can't--oh, my God.
- She was insulted at first.

15:15.201 --> 15:16.635
Thought she was doing something wrong.

15:16.669 --> 15:18.938
But God damn it, she wasn't.
She was doing everything right.

15:18.972 --> 15:20.172
Check please.

15:20.206 --> 15:22.441
I mean, she was
making me explode, but up here.

15:22.475 --> 15:23.576
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

15:23.610 --> 15:24.844
Ew.

15:24.878 --> 15:27.013
When we make love
it is like a Fourth of July

15:27.048 --> 15:30.384
fireworks display in the
screening room that is my mind.

15:30.418 --> 15:32.252
I don't get this whole
tantric sex dealio.

15:32.287 --> 15:35.256
Sex should have a very strict
three-act structure.

15:35.290 --> 15:36.657
Beginning, middle, and end.

15:36.691 --> 15:39.393
Maybe a third act twist thrown
in there for good measure.

15:39.427 --> 15:40.861
Well, listen,
Hank is an incredible lover.

15:40.895 --> 15:42.563
Oh, for fuck's sake, Carrie.
Come on.

15:42.597 --> 15:44.231
- [Laughs]
- I'm fine with it.

15:44.265 --> 15:45.398
- She knows.
- Oh.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.634
No, you and Karen had
a tremendous sex life.

15:47.668 --> 15:49.035
What?
I never said that.

15:49.070 --> 15:50.504
I'm glad she was
fulfilled in that way.

15:50.538 --> 15:51.872
A blind man could see it.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.107
If it sets the bar higher for me,

15:53.141 --> 15:54.609
so much the better.

15:54.643 --> 15:57.044
There's no resting on one's
laurels in this household.

15:57.079 --> 15:59.548
- Or in that bedroom.
- I gotta say something.

15:59.582 --> 16:02.183
My man is a pretty
fabulous fucking lover.

16:02.218 --> 16:03.952
I just--
I gotta put that out there.

16:03.986 --> 16:06.388
We're sharing.
I love you.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.423
You know,
I gotta tell ya--

16:07.457 --> 16:08.657
I could eat this woman for dessert.

16:08.692 --> 16:09.759
Aw!

16:09.793 --> 16:11.861
Can we stop with
all this lover bullshit?

16:11.895 --> 16:13.396
This is creeping me out.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.264
The next thing I know
one of you freaks

16:15.298 --> 16:19.235
is gonna suggest group sex.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.904
What is wrong with you people?

16:21.938 --> 16:24.573
- Mm.
- Mm--Charlie.

16:24.607 --> 16:25.674
Mm? Yeah?

16:25.708 --> 16:26.675
I have to tell you something.

16:26.709 --> 16:27.909
No, I know, I know.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.344
It unhooks in the front.

16:29.378 --> 16:30.612
I always get it mixed up.

16:30.646 --> 16:31.880
No, no, not that.

16:31.914 --> 16:33.948
No, it's just--
uh, I've never done this before.

16:33.982 --> 16:36.484
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's okay, I'm not judging you.

16:36.518 --> 16:37.518
No.

16:37.553 --> 16:38.753
Mm--no,
you don't understand.

16:38.787 --> 16:40.221
I--

16:40.256 --> 16:42.624
I'm a virgin.

16:42.658 --> 16:44.126
What?

16:44.160 --> 16:45.727
I've never had sex.

16:45.762 --> 16:46.995
Never?

16:47.030 --> 16:48.097
Ever?

16:48.131 --> 16:50.533
Okay, well...

16:50.567 --> 16:54.170
I let my friend Lindsay
finger me in seventh grade.

16:54.204 --> 16:56.638
And it was not nearly as hot
as it sounds.

16:56.673 --> 17:01.009
I mean, uh, she was
morbidly obese and smelled like

17:01.043 --> 17:03.377
McDonald's French fries.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.880
She also farted in the middle of it.

17:05.914 --> 17:07.681
We don't have to do this.

17:07.715 --> 17:08.982
No, oh, no!
I didn't mean it that way.

17:09.017 --> 17:10.317
No, I wanna do this.

17:10.351 --> 17:13.486
I've been sitting around
waiting for Mr. Right

17:13.521 --> 17:17.590
and I just want
a Mr. Right Now to deflower me.

17:17.625 --> 17:20.194
And look,
for better or worse, Charlie,

17:20.228 --> 17:21.462
that's you.

17:21.497 --> 17:24.898
Oh, I want you to be
the first man on my moon.

17:24.934 --> 17:28.871
I don't wanna die a smelly,
stinky old virgin creature.

17:28.906 --> 17:32.008
You don't seem that stinky.

17:32.043 --> 17:33.710
Thank you.
Ooh.

17:33.745 --> 17:35.445
Okay, this is really a lot to process.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.647
I just--I don't know
how I feel about this.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.249
Okay, well, I understand

17:39.283 --> 17:40.317
if you don't wanna do it.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.385
Look, I--

17:42.420 --> 17:44.821
I just--I don't know
what to do anymore.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.922
I waited around
for Prince Charming forever...

17:46.957 --> 17:48.891
- Yeah, well.
- And he never showed.

17:48.925 --> 17:51.159
- Yeah.
- I have needs, Charlie.

17:51.194 --> 17:53.128
- Sure.
- Desires.

17:53.162 --> 17:54.996
I'm not a prude.

17:55.030 --> 17:58.333
Yeah, I'll--
I'll do things.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.370
Dirty things.

18:04.508 --> 18:07.343
You're blowing my mind right now.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.980
Ravage me, Charlie!
Ravage me!

18:10.014 --> 18:12.816
Ooh! Ooh!

18:12.850 --> 18:14.751
Oh, wow.

18:14.786 --> 18:17.922
[Passionate moans]

18:17.956 --> 18:20.158
- Unh!
- Oh!

18:20.192 --> 18:21.159
Oh, there you are.

18:21.193 --> 18:22.828
[British accent] Knocking at my door!

18:22.862 --> 18:24.062
Unh!

18:24.097 --> 18:26.165
I can see that the king
has sent you, my liege,

18:26.199 --> 18:28.968
to collect my hymen
and I shall bequeath it to you!

18:29.002 --> 18:30.303
Oh, wow!

18:30.337 --> 18:32.272
- That feels good!
- Unh!

18:32.306 --> 18:34.474
- Oh, <i>entrez vous!</i>
- Unh!

18:34.509 --> 18:36.977
Push it in! Go get it!
Go and don't be afraid.

18:37.011 --> 18:38.979
- Unh!
- Ah!

18:39.013 --> 18:40.780
Wha--what's happening?

18:40.814 --> 18:43.383
What?
What happened to your little--?

18:43.417 --> 18:46.586
Oh, I see what's going on.
You're not attracted to me.

18:46.621 --> 18:47.654
I mean, how could you be?

18:47.688 --> 18:49.389
No!

18:49.423 --> 18:52.592
No, it's not you, it's just--
it's--it's a lot of pressure

18:52.626 --> 18:53.626
to be someone's first.

18:53.661 --> 18:56.496
- I'm--I'm sorry.
- Ugh.

18:56.530 --> 18:57.497
I--

18:57.531 --> 18:59.232
I feel so ashamed.

18:59.267 --> 19:02.235
You should be.

19:02.269 --> 19:04.171
Oh.

19:04.205 --> 19:05.906
Shame boner.

19:05.940 --> 19:06.974
It's back.

19:07.008 --> 19:09.076
Oh, so it is.

19:09.110 --> 19:11.545
- Do you still wanna?
- Sure, okay.

19:11.579 --> 19:13.514
- Okay?
- Yeah, let's do it.

19:13.548 --> 19:15.916
Okay.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.651
Okay, yeah.

19:17.685 --> 19:20.186
[Passionate moan]

19:20.221 --> 19:24.824
Ow!

19:24.858 --> 19:28.094
- Aah!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:28.129 --> 19:32.266
- [Grunts]
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:32.300 --> 19:34.267
[Exhales]

19:34.302 --> 19:35.469
[Grunts]

19:35.503 --> 19:37.404
Oh...

19:37.438 --> 19:40.173
Ugh.

19:40.207 --> 19:42.842
Whoa.

19:42.876 --> 19:45.011
That's it?

19:45.045 --> 19:48.180
Yeah, pretty much.

19:48.214 --> 19:50.348
That's how a lot of first times are.

19:50.382 --> 19:55.653
[Crying]

19:55.687 --> 19:57.655
I don't think anal sex
gets enough credit.

19:57.689 --> 19:59.523
I mean, I used to think
it was good, dirty fun.

19:59.557 --> 20:00.758
Extra cream in mine.

20:00.792 --> 20:01.993
Now I think it's about something else.

20:02.027 --> 20:03.194
I think it's about something more.

20:03.228 --> 20:04.295
- Intimacy.
- Mm-hm.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.530
I mean, to go in through the out door

20:06.564 --> 20:09.133
is maybe the most beautiful act
known to God or man.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.668
- I agree. I agree. I agree.
- Uh.

20:11.703 --> 20:13.036
Listen, in fact I have a lot to say

20:13.071 --> 20:14.071
on the subject.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.940
Becca!
Thank God.

20:15.974 --> 20:17.642
- Hi, Beckers.
- Where you been?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.744
Uh, nowhere special.

20:19.779 --> 20:23.015
Nowhere special with whom, perchance?

20:23.049 --> 20:24.716
If you must know, Tyler.

20:24.751 --> 20:26.886
No, you're not ser--
you're not serious.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.954
Are you serious?

20:27.988 --> 20:29.422
What?

20:29.456 --> 20:30.890
I thought you said that was
over, you were done with him.

20:30.924 --> 20:32.726
- That was it.
- I was.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.594
But he kept texting me, so I cracked

20:34.628 --> 20:36.029
and texted him back.

20:36.063 --> 20:37.330
It was good, we cleared the air.

20:37.364 --> 20:38.898
So that's it?
It's back on?

20:38.932 --> 20:42.034
- That--that's it.
- Not necessarily.

20:42.068 --> 20:44.069
It took you so long to get over him.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.904
What, you're just
gonna go forgive him?

20:45.938 --> 20:47.172
Yeah.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.606
I wonder where I got that from.

20:48.641 --> 20:51.108
Hey, hey, that's no way
to talk to your moth--Becca.

20:51.143 --> 20:52.109
- Whatever.
- She's right.

20:52.144 --> 20:53.110
She's absolutely right.

20:53.145 --> 20:54.311
No, she's not right.

20:54.346 --> 20:55.713
And even if she were,
you're her parent.

20:55.747 --> 20:58.383
It's your job to
make her feel like she's wrong.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.318
- That's fucked up.
- No, you know what's fucked up?

21:00.353 --> 21:01.920
Is her getting back into the snake pit

21:01.955 --> 21:03.823
with that D'Artagnan-looking
motherfucker

21:03.857 --> 21:06.192
with his hair and his fucking--
his facial hair.

21:06.226 --> 21:08.027
It's unsavory is what it is.

21:08.061 --> 21:09.095
It's not funny.

21:09.129 --> 21:10.396
Do you wanna talk about this later?

21:10.431 --> 21:11.998
Why? So we can get back
to talking about anal

21:12.032 --> 21:13.666
with the Kinsey Report over here?

21:13.701 --> 21:15.668
Watch your tone, Hank.
The woman you're disrespecting

21:15.703 --> 21:16.936
is currently under my jurisdiction.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.304
Mind your business, Batesy.

21:18.338 --> 21:20.573
We happen to be talking about
a child that we share.

21:20.607 --> 21:22.874
Keep it up, sweetheart,
and you and I are gonna end up

21:22.909 --> 21:23.909
back on that dance floor, you hear me?

21:23.943 --> 21:25.410
Oh, I hear you, dick.

21:25.444 --> 21:28.079
And I'd be happy to dance
with you anytime, anywhere,

21:28.113 --> 21:29.413
you pansexual fucking weirdo.

21:29.447 --> 21:31.448
Looks like I'm getting
your Irish up there, son.

21:31.482 --> 21:32.916
No, not at all.
Care for a drink?

21:32.950 --> 21:34.183
You'd probably like that,
wouldn't you?

21:34.218 --> 21:35.852
I would, let's see
that fucking mangina.

21:35.886 --> 21:38.822
You wanna eat my peach,
I'll bust her out right now.

21:38.857 --> 21:40.124
Guys, it's really nice
to be fought over

21:40.158 --> 21:42.159
but, you know,
let's not ruin the bromance.

21:42.193 --> 21:43.227
Oh, my God!

21:43.261 --> 21:44.328
This is never going anywhere, is it?

21:44.363 --> 21:45.830
- What?
- You!

21:45.865 --> 21:47.565
You're never gonna be able
to commit to another woman!

21:47.600 --> 21:50.169
Carrie, this is neither
the time nor the place.

21:50.203 --> 21:51.537
Actually, it's kind of hilarious.

21:51.572 --> 21:53.706
I came here thinking that
I was gonna try and convince you

21:53.741 --> 21:55.108
to give it another try.

21:55.142 --> 21:56.175
- You know what's hilarious?
- What?

21:56.210 --> 21:57.844
Is the fact that we broke up.

21:57.878 --> 21:59.578
And you set my apartment on fire!

21:59.613 --> 22:01.614
Okay, but you know what the
best part about all this is?

22:01.648 --> 22:03.516
Is that this whole time I was thinking

22:03.551 --> 22:04.717
that this was my fault.

22:04.751 --> 22:06.218
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

22:06.253 --> 22:09.221
But it's you.

22:09.256 --> 22:10.456
You're a loser, Hank.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.790
All your friends here,

22:11.825 --> 22:13.592
they all have love in their
lives, they've moved on.

22:13.626 --> 22:16.361
But you, you have--
you have nothing.

22:16.396 --> 22:17.963
Wow.

22:17.997 --> 22:19.498
Cheers, thank you.

22:19.532 --> 22:20.633
Congratulations, Karen.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.768
I don't know how you did it,
but--

22:22.802 --> 22:23.769
Well...What?

22:23.803 --> 22:24.836
What do you mean?

22:24.871 --> 22:26.872
Carrie, I'm sorry you got hurt.

22:26.906 --> 22:28.873
I thought we had an understanding.

22:28.908 --> 22:29.908
I thought you understood me.

22:29.942 --> 22:31.442
You fucked me in the ass, Hank!

22:31.476 --> 22:33.444
- Oh, my God.
- I swallowed your cum.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.712
[Sighs]

22:34.746 --> 22:38.048
But worst of all I
swallowed your fucking bullshit.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.050
And you can rationalize it
all you want by saying that

22:40.085 --> 22:44.221
you were always honest with me,

22:44.255 --> 22:47.490
but it's still stealing.

23:04.643 --> 23:05.777
Are you okay?

23:05.811 --> 23:07.278
Mm.

23:07.313 --> 23:11.083
Just licking my wounds.

23:11.117 --> 23:14.120
Marcy and Stu will give you a ride.

23:14.155 --> 23:16.389
Or you could spend the night with us.

23:16.423 --> 23:19.425
Yeah, I think I'd rather
go noose shopping, actually.

23:19.459 --> 23:24.096
Well, that's a shame.
We'll miss you.

23:24.130 --> 23:26.064
Chick really leveled me, didn't she?

23:26.098 --> 23:29.600
Yeah, she got you pretty bad.

23:29.635 --> 23:32.202
Took me back
to some of our greatest hits.

23:32.237 --> 23:35.238
Oh, how I miss our fights of fancy.

23:35.273 --> 23:38.575
- Oh, how I don't.
- [Laughs]

23:38.610 --> 23:41.078
You know, when you and Bates
got together I was kinda happy

23:41.113 --> 23:42.680
'cause I thought "It's fucking lunacy,"

23:42.715 --> 23:44.516
this is never gonna work,"
but it does.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.152
I guess.
Kind of.

23:47.186 --> 23:50.623
It's been kind of nice
in a way though.

23:50.657 --> 23:52.057
[Sighs]

23:52.092 --> 23:54.794
Not having to watch you
fall in love with someone else.

23:54.829 --> 23:56.229
Mm.

23:56.264 --> 23:58.598
But I don't want you to be lonely.

23:58.633 --> 24:00.500
Aw, pshaw.
I ain't lonely.

24:00.534 --> 24:02.869
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

24:02.903 --> 24:04.370
You're like this little boy lost.

24:04.404 --> 24:06.872
You kind of--it didn't
work out between us

24:06.907 --> 24:08.341
and you're still pouting.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.110
You picked up your ball
and you run home

24:11.144 --> 24:14.280
and you're never ever gonna
play with anyone else again.

24:14.314 --> 24:15.981
Yeah, well, I guess being in New York

24:16.015 --> 24:18.216
makes it easier to forget that I still

24:18.251 --> 24:21.787
love the shit out of you, Karen.

24:21.822 --> 24:23.222
Yeah, wow.

24:23.256 --> 24:26.292
I said that out loud, didn't I?

24:26.326 --> 24:28.494
So?

24:28.528 --> 24:30.863
I still love you.
I always will.

24:30.897 --> 24:32.464
Till the day I die.

24:32.498 --> 24:35.568
But at some point
I had to choose happiness.

24:35.602 --> 24:37.003
I have to make that a priority.

24:37.037 --> 24:40.273
I mean--and now I'm
with someone who understands

24:40.307 --> 24:41.675
that I will never stop loving you.

24:41.709 --> 24:43.877
And that makes me happier
than I've ever been.

24:43.911 --> 24:46.447
Good.
[Laughs]

24:46.482 --> 24:49.384
That's fantastic.

24:49.418 --> 24:51.486
She's right, you're wonderful.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.989
You are,
and when women get to know you,

24:54.023 --> 24:57.292
you know, of course they want more.

24:57.327 --> 24:59.795
But it's kinda cruel to let them think

24:59.829 --> 25:02.697
that they can have it when really...

25:02.732 --> 25:04.032
it's just no more than a hologram.

25:04.066 --> 25:05.868
Contrary to popular belief,
I'm not out there

25:05.902 --> 25:08.370
- trying to hurt anyone, Karen.
- I know.

25:08.404 --> 25:11.173
But what do you think Becca's
suffering from right now?

25:11.207 --> 25:14.577
Some guy, good or bad,
he's charmed his way

25:14.611 --> 25:18.581
into her heart,
and obviously she wants more.

25:18.616 --> 25:20.217
You're trying to tell me
that I've given her

25:20.251 --> 25:21.985
some kind of horrible daddy complex?

25:22.019 --> 25:23.520
No, no, don't worry about her.

25:23.554 --> 25:24.855
I'm talking about you.

25:24.889 --> 25:28.091
Worry about yourself.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.227
'Cause if really--
if all your life is

25:30.261 --> 25:35.832
is a series of fucking
meaningless...flings...

25:35.866 --> 25:40.169
and some idealized
vision of our love story...

25:42.473 --> 25:44.373
Then I'm really sad for you.

25:44.407 --> 25:46.509
Because I know what you're capable of.

25:46.543 --> 25:47.797
Yeah, well, what if you're wrong?

25:47.917 --> 25:49.332
What if this is it for me?

25:49.452 --> 25:51.247
What if I'm just destined
to sit around and wait

25:51.281 --> 25:52.963
for the band to get back together?

25:58.121 --> 25:59.550
You'll be waiting on a miracle.
