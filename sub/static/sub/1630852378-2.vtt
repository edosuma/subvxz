02:34.199 --> 02:36.289
(Holding Cell 2)

02:41.419 --> 02:42.539
Guk Hwa...

02:47.509 --> 02:48.629
Her name was...

02:49.629 --> 02:51.129
Guk Hwa.

03:02.400 --> 03:08.490
(Episode 2: The Suspect)

03:12.990 --> 03:14.240
First off,

03:14.949 --> 03:17.199
we should make sure they can't get your arrest warrant issued.

03:17.409 --> 03:19.289
If they manage to get it, it'll be a headache...

03:19.750 --> 03:20.909
for both of us.

03:21.370 --> 03:23.330
It'll work to your disadvantage at the trial.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.629
You met Chief Park Sang Bum, didn't you?

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
Yes.

03:29.801 --> 03:31.879
Tell them he forced a confession out of you.

03:33.969 --> 03:36.349
But he didn't.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.099
Perhaps they forgot to recite the Miranda Rights.

03:41.849 --> 03:44.099
No, they recited the whole thing.

03:44.270 --> 03:45.270
They did?

03:46.770 --> 03:48.859
They usually use force when making an arrest...

03:48.860 --> 03:51.949
without a warrant in such an emergency situation.

03:53.490 --> 03:57.330
They must've cursed at you at least. "You scumbag!"

04:01.500 --> 04:04.038
Hey! Can you do something about the light bulb here?

04:04.039 --> 04:06.039
It's so distracting. Fix it already.

04:06.789 --> 04:08.500
Are we at a club or what?

04:13.219 --> 04:14.379
This is bad.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.600
Where are you going?

04:20.970 --> 04:22.768
I need to figure out what's going on.

04:22.769 --> 04:25.399
I'll listen to what the police have to say and eat something.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.360
By the way, have you eaten yet?

04:29.730 --> 04:31.189
I'm not hungry.

04:32.319 --> 04:34.699
Really? Okay.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.870
Hey, let me out.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.389
What did the victim look like when she was found?

05:04.850 --> 05:06.480
I didn't see the victim at the scene.

05:06.899 --> 05:09.859
But from what I've heard, he slashed the girl like this...

05:09.860 --> 05:13.689
Actually, no. He stabbed her deeply.

05:14.110 --> 05:15.899
Not just once. 13 times.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.199
So obviously, she wasn't found in good condition.

05:19.870 --> 05:22.199
Thirteen times...

05:23.910 --> 05:25.040
Who's in charge of the case?

05:26.160 --> 05:29.459
- Chief Park Sang Bum. - Why did he take it on?

05:29.670 --> 05:31.550
He'll retire soon.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.588
It's not like volunteering for it will make him rich.

05:34.589 --> 05:37.129
Well, he still has three months left.

05:39.220 --> 05:40.929
(Chungang Police Station)

05:40.930 --> 05:43.389
It's not looking good.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.389
You don't want to drink this?

05:46.019 --> 05:48.230
I'm hungry. I want food.

05:48.399 --> 05:50.310
You can drink this after your meal.

05:52.610 --> 05:54.529
Here you go.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.029
- Here you go. - Thank you.

06:01.579 --> 06:04.449
- I'd like lots of solid bits. - Sure.

06:08.709 --> 06:09.790
Yes.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.500
- Thank you. - Here you go.

06:55.379 --> 06:56.420
Shall we?

07:09.889 --> 07:11.980
I already told you everything.

07:12.810 --> 07:16.230
I parked my car there to rest for a moment.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.149
After a drink or two?

07:19.279 --> 07:21.949
No, not at all.

07:30.290 --> 07:31.829
Draw a circle on the face you saw.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.209
You already know who it is.

07:35.629 --> 07:36.750
It's this punk right here.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.889
Sign your name at the bottom.

07:53.149 --> 07:58.730
(Seung Hoon)

08:10.500 --> 08:12.790
- Oh, boy. - Have you tried it?

08:13.290 --> 08:14.750
What? The red ginseng extract?

08:15.379 --> 08:17.420
Hey, when I put it on,

08:17.709 --> 08:19.838
it stinks all day. My goodness.

08:19.839 --> 08:20.878
Have you tried it yourself?

08:20.879 --> 08:23.720
That's why I told you to put it on at night.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.259
You never told me that.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.850
Yes, I did.

08:28.889 --> 08:31.019
Darn it. No wonder.

08:34.269 --> 08:36.610
Everyone cares a great deal for my feet.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.819
I have atopic dermatitis.

08:38.820 --> 08:41.360
But it's not contagious, so don't worry.

08:43.110 --> 08:44.860
You have asthma, don't you?

08:45.820 --> 08:48.070
I had asthma when I was little,

08:48.740 --> 08:51.870
so I can tell from that wheezing.

08:55.210 --> 08:56.250
Hyun Soo.

08:57.129 --> 08:59.879
I can relate to how you must be feeling right now,

09:00.460 --> 09:02.589
so let me give you two pieces of advice.

09:02.590 --> 09:05.470
Listen carefully and keep them etched in your heart.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.889
Okay?

09:08.509 --> 09:10.179
- Okay. - First,

09:10.639 --> 09:13.350
the truth and justice.

09:14.059 --> 09:16.480
Such things don't exist here, so don't even think about it.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.519
Facts don't matter, and neither do your claims.

09:20.190 --> 09:21.730
So what matters?

09:22.070 --> 09:23.399
Repeat after me.

09:23.649 --> 09:27.200
"What has to be a fact for me to be at an advantage?"

09:28.279 --> 09:32.080
"What has to be a fact for me to be at an advantage?"

09:32.240 --> 09:34.120
Good. Here's the second one.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.918
From here on,

09:36.919 --> 09:40.378
when referring to what happened last night,

09:40.379 --> 09:42.799
everyone will just call it "that night."

09:43.340 --> 09:45.220
Repeat after me. "That night."

09:49.299 --> 09:51.009
"That night."

09:52.259 --> 09:53.309
Good.

09:53.559 --> 09:54.809
From this moment,

09:56.100 --> 09:59.769
you won't say anything about that night.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.320
No exceptions. Never.

10:05.490 --> 10:06.700
Do you understand?

10:10.950 --> 10:14.120
We were just wrapping up our DUI checkpoints.

10:14.950 --> 10:16.909
So at first, I thought he was drunk driving.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.669
He had a blank stare...

10:22.840 --> 10:24.048
and seemed dangerous.

10:24.049 --> 10:26.009
Were you the first to arrive at the scene?

10:26.509 --> 10:27.590
The scene?

10:28.009 --> 10:30.549
Yes, sir. I was the first to arrive.

10:32.009 --> 10:35.558
Sorry. Could we not talk about how I threw up at the scene?

10:35.559 --> 10:36.559
Hey.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.059
Look at the camera, not me.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.729
It's just embarrassing, that's all.

10:41.730 --> 10:42.899
Seriously?

10:43.610 --> 10:46.360
Cut the sideshow and state what you saw.

10:47.190 --> 10:48.989
- I apologize. - In the back of the squad car,

10:48.990 --> 10:51.028
he asked about the girl.

10:51.029 --> 10:52.370
Be more specific.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.870
He asked if the girl was dead.

10:55.580 --> 10:56.580
Right.

10:58.159 --> 11:00.999
He asked, "Is the girl dead?"

11:01.000 --> 11:02.668
Right around now,

11:02.669 --> 11:04.379
the police will be busy getting their stories straight.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.418
The police come up with their version of events...

11:06.419 --> 11:08.169
and we come up with ours.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.428
The judge listens to both and selects which is more believable.

11:11.429 --> 11:12.590
That's how a trial works.

11:12.970 --> 11:15.058
So if you keep your mouth shut,

11:15.059 --> 11:18.639
we'll be able to find out what story they're cooking up.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
But...

11:21.850 --> 11:26.149
shouldn't you know what really happened to me though?

11:28.860 --> 11:30.990
You and your constant need for the truth.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.070
Obsessing over that won't get you very far.

11:34.830 --> 11:36.538
I already told you that the police...

11:36.539 --> 11:38.289
is putting together a story of their own.

11:42.210 --> 11:45.090
(Forensics)

11:52.679 --> 11:54.009
- Sir, you're here. - Right.

11:54.759 --> 11:57.139
I'm sure it all started at this table.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.879
Remember Chief Park Sang Bum whom you met?

12:31.549 --> 12:34.428
He went from beat cop and all the way...

12:34.429 --> 12:36.299
to leading his own team.

12:37.389 --> 12:40.019
Whether it's evidence or witnesses,

12:40.470 --> 12:41.929
no matter how small the detail is,

12:42.230 --> 12:44.100
he gathers information firsthand.

12:46.059 --> 12:48.860
He didn't seem like a bad person.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.490
Hyun Soo, you should know...

12:55.529 --> 12:58.070
that there are no good or bad people here.

12:58.990 --> 13:03.120
They live by the justice that they seem is fitting.

13:04.289 --> 13:06.749
A cop foolishly seeking justice...

13:06.750 --> 13:09.090
and always hoping for a happy ending?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.169
They only exist in movies.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.639
Besides, Chief Park?

13:18.259 --> 13:19.259
Well, he's like...

13:20.470 --> 13:22.059
a beast operating in silence.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.440
A veteran.

13:29.190 --> 13:31.899
He waits for the right timing instead of being too eager.

13:32.529 --> 13:34.070
He even shows kindness at times.

13:35.029 --> 13:37.240
The man waits for you to slip up.

13:39.870 --> 13:40.870
I...

13:42.289 --> 13:43.450
can't...

13:44.159 --> 13:46.000
I can't breathe.

13:46.870 --> 13:48.250
Of course.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.089
This is a new experience for you.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.460
No, that's not it. I...

13:53.169 --> 13:54.879
I have asthma, you see.

13:58.889 --> 14:01.389
And once he finds your weakness,

14:01.600 --> 14:03.179
he will pounce and bite!

14:04.350 --> 14:07.600
He will cut you off at the jugular...

14:09.149 --> 14:11.480
and gnaw away your soul.

14:29.960 --> 14:30.960
Huh?

14:33.169 --> 14:34.169
Yes, hello.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.919
No, I'm almost there.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.628
I'm nearby, so wait for me.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.759
Got it.

14:41.049 --> 14:42.429
Hey, I'm done here.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.309
What's going on?

14:44.470 --> 14:46.058
I'm late for a hearing.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.638
Judges hate tardiness,

14:48.639 --> 14:50.309
and it's not how I should treat clients.

14:50.940 --> 14:52.690
What about me then?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.940
I'll be back once I'm done.

14:56.110 --> 14:57.399
What should you do until I come back?

14:58.990 --> 15:00.200
I'll keep my mouth shut.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.450
Okay, good.

(Seoul Southern District Court)

Case number 2021KD102635.

15:28.179 --> 15:30.809
I will rule on the assault charges.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.649
It is clear that the defendant caused bodily harm...

15:35.149 --> 15:38.778
- which is why I sentence him to... - A lawyer shouldn't be late.

15:38.779 --> 15:40.990
Don't be ridiculous. I'm right on time.

15:42.070 --> 15:43.070
Put on a neck tie.

15:43.071 --> 15:45.028
Forget it. I haven't worn one since middle school graduation.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.279
- Here. - What the...

15:46.659 --> 15:48.158
As if a neck tie suits what I'm wearing.

15:48.159 --> 15:50.158
Put it on if you don't want to get fined.

15:50.159 --> 15:51.159
Unbelievable.

15:58.210 --> 15:59.509
Let me see.

16:00.879 --> 16:02.049
That's not mine.

16:02.470 --> 16:03.470
Is that so?

16:04.090 --> 16:05.889
Hold on. What's your case number?

16:06.389 --> 16:07.849
Seriously?

16:07.850 --> 16:10.018
One's allowed to get confused. It's this right here, isn't it?

His lawyer Shin Joong Han is also present.

16:44.799 --> 16:46.139
Darn it.

16:52.559 --> 16:53.599
Hello?

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
This is Chief Park Sang Bum...

16:54.601 --> 16:56.399
from Chungang Police Criminal Department.

16:57.610 --> 16:58.648
The police?

16:58.649 --> 17:00.649
I'm calling with information regarding Ms. Hong Guk Hwa.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.149
Are you her father?

17:03.610 --> 17:05.659
Just tell her I can't be reached.

17:05.660 --> 17:08.700
Actually, we need identification.

17:10.869 --> 17:11.869
Identification?

(Autopsy Report)

17:58.579 --> 17:59.920
(Autopsy Report)

18:03.000 --> 18:05.669
Ms. Hong doesn't seem to be your biological daughter.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.680
May I ask the details of your relationship?

18:09.430 --> 18:11.469
Guk Hwa's mother passed away two years ago.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.640
She held out with stage-three cancer.

18:13.970 --> 18:15.479
Our marriage was short,

18:15.480 --> 18:17.559
so Guk Hwa and I are only family on paper.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.980
The house is still a crime scene,

18:21.309 --> 18:23.279
so you won't have access for a while.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.990
I don't live there anyway, so it's fine.

18:26.740 --> 18:29.159
I left the house after Guk Hwa's mom passed away.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.740
You know, because of the awkwardness.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.170
We need you to consent to the autopsy.

18:59.519 --> 19:02.690
(Cho Kang Pil, Stepfather)

19:05.440 --> 19:07.779
A neck tie hardly goes with this outfit.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.818
That neck tie let you get off without a fine.

19:10.819 --> 19:12.910
Otherwise, you would've gotten a fine of a few thousand dollars.

19:13.410 --> 19:14.410
How many months?

19:14.619 --> 19:15.619
I'll pay in full.

19:16.119 --> 19:18.288
You get the ten percent regular customer discount.

19:18.289 --> 19:20.210
So that brings the total to...

19:21.039 --> 19:22.879
(Authorized)

19:22.880 --> 19:25.839
With an app, you might as well start a lawyer delivery business.

19:27.839 --> 19:29.469
I thought I got a ten percent discount.

19:29.470 --> 19:31.589
There's surtax to consider.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.639
It's why I said you should pay cash.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.099
You really are something, aren't you?

19:36.890 --> 19:38.599
Well, one must make a living.

19:40.890 --> 19:42.058
Until next time, then.

19:42.059 --> 19:43.059
Sure.

19:45.940 --> 19:47.940
Unbelievable.

19:57.450 --> 20:00.910
What on earth did I just say?

20:04.130 --> 20:05.880
Hey, you.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.169
When you get caught after conning people,

20:10.170 --> 20:12.589
it does fatten my wallet which I'm not complaining about.

20:13.930 --> 20:16.259
But it's about time you step away from that life.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.180
Haven't you shed...

20:18.640 --> 20:20.559
enough innocent tears?

20:20.809 --> 20:22.309
What a jerk.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.019
One must make a living, right?

20:25.519 --> 20:29.730
You'll end up living off prison food at that rate.

20:30.990 --> 20:31.990
I'll see you around.

20:41.660 --> 20:42.909
- Chief. - Yes?

20:42.910 --> 20:44.579
Kim Hyun Soo's parents are here.

20:51.259 --> 20:52.470
Is there an empty room?

20:53.180 --> 20:54.429
I'll get one ready right now.

20:54.430 --> 20:55.430
Good.

20:57.599 --> 20:59.348
- Hello. - Goodness.

20:59.349 --> 21:01.219
Are you Hyun Soo's parents?

21:01.220 --> 21:03.190
- Yes. - Yes, hello.

21:13.609 --> 21:14.650
There.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.569
Relax, okay?

21:19.779 --> 21:20.789
- Thank you. - Thank you.

21:28.839 --> 21:32.420
Sweetheart, my goodness. You look so weary.

21:32.630 --> 21:34.630
Are you all right? You're not hurt?

21:35.680 --> 21:38.048
Tell me, Hyun Soo. This is a misunderstanding, right?

21:38.049 --> 21:39.970
The police are mistaken, right?

21:40.099 --> 21:41.099
Yes, tell us.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.519
I can't say I had nothing to do with it.

21:51.819 --> 21:52.859
What about the knife?

21:53.109 --> 21:56.319
They said you had the knife. It's not true, right?

21:58.490 --> 22:00.160
It is true.

22:02.869 --> 22:05.660
But I didn't kill her.

22:06.539 --> 22:07.710
This is so funny.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.999
This stop is... Jangsong Station, Exit 3.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.299
- The next stop is... - This looks weird.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.298
- My gosh. - But you see, this one...

22:18.299 --> 22:20.759
Look at this spot right here.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.229
I know. I have no idea what this is.

22:25.230 --> 22:27.309
How do you do this though? It's pretty cool.

22:34.779 --> 22:36.950
- Excuse me. - Yes?

22:37.029 --> 22:38.700
- I'm a lawyer. - A lawyer?

22:38.819 --> 22:41.028
That's right. Give me a call.

22:41.029 --> 22:42.619
I'll do a good job.

22:42.910 --> 22:45.199
But I must say, you're quite clumsy.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.160
You'll get caught in no time if you use the camera on your phone.

22:47.369 --> 22:48.420
Sir.

22:48.750 --> 22:52.210
Article 14.2 of the Sexual Offences Act...

22:52.539 --> 22:55.048
states that you may be sentenced to jail for up to five years...

22:55.049 --> 22:57.049
or fined up to 30,000 dollars when you illegally film someone.

22:58.259 --> 22:59.549
I guess you didn't know.

23:00.180 --> 23:01.220
Hey, miss.

23:01.430 --> 23:05.519
That man over there filmed you without your consent.

23:06.849 --> 23:08.269
Here, I'm a lawyer.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.189
If you ever see the video...

23:10.190 --> 23:12.268
uploaded onto the web, give me a call.

23:12.269 --> 23:15.109
This is my specialty.

23:16.359 --> 23:18.318
- A video? - Yes, this man right here.

23:18.319 --> 23:19.910
- Excuse me. - Hey!

23:20.319 --> 23:21.950
Did you secretly film us?

23:22.029 --> 23:23.449
- Where's your phone? - Hand over the phone.

23:23.450 --> 23:25.328
- I didn't film anything. - Then show us your phone.

23:25.329 --> 23:27.868
- Feel free to contact me. - Thank you.

23:27.869 --> 23:29.868
You'll be paying me, so there's no need to thank me.

23:29.869 --> 23:32.788
- Hand over the phone! - Show us your phone.

23:45.759 --> 23:46.769
Hello.

23:50.140 --> 23:51.849
My goodness.

23:53.690 --> 23:54.690
Darn it.

23:55.519 --> 23:58.569
Why is it pouring all of a sudden? Darn it.

24:00.029 --> 24:01.490
Hey.

24:03.279 --> 24:06.369
Where is Hyun Soo? Where...

24:09.289 --> 24:10.460
What's going on?

24:14.710 --> 24:17.670
Hey, Hyun Soo. What are you doing here?

24:19.130 --> 24:21.549
My parents are here.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.589
I see.

24:25.049 --> 24:27.059
Hello.

24:27.309 --> 24:29.559
I'm Shin Joong Han, a lawyer.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.269
I see, hello.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.650
He's my lawyer.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.609
That jerk...

25:08.599 --> 25:11.140
Oh, boy. What's with the weather?

25:12.230 --> 25:14.690
What a lousy day.

25:16.980 --> 25:20.190
Why are you sticking your nose into everything?

25:20.730 --> 25:22.819
What are you talking about?

25:23.359 --> 25:25.029
Watch what you say.

25:26.279 --> 25:27.779
Are you struggling these days?

25:29.410 --> 25:31.910
You haven't told the prosecution that he should be indicted, right?

25:32.619 --> 25:34.829
Because you have that icky feeling hanging over your head,

25:35.079 --> 25:37.209
like when you forget to wipe your butt after pooping.

25:37.210 --> 25:39.670
I'm already flushing the toilet paper down the toilet.

25:40.170 --> 25:41.920
It's already over.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.258
Getting ready to clean the pot when the rice isn't even cooked yet?

25:47.259 --> 25:49.349
The way I see it, it's only starting now.

25:51.849 --> 25:54.269
Don't be greedy.

25:54.769 --> 25:57.518
I'll jump rope with Hyun Soo, so you hold the rope.

25:57.519 --> 26:01.650
Do it with me. Why would you do it with Hyun Soo?

26:02.400 --> 26:05.900
And look at yourself. You're retiring in three months.

26:06.529 --> 26:08.950
Don't be so greedy,

26:09.279 --> 26:10.619
or your rope will snap.

26:21.549 --> 26:23.960
This coffee tastes awful.

26:32.430 --> 26:34.390
Hey, Hyun Soo. What did I say?

26:35.059 --> 26:36.769
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

26:37.309 --> 26:39.190
But how? My parents came to see me.

26:39.650 --> 26:41.309
I didn't say much though.

26:42.069 --> 26:44.730
Everything you and your parents said was recorded.

26:45.279 --> 26:47.449
If you said anything stupid...

26:47.450 --> 26:49.160
I'm sure you did.

26:49.319 --> 26:51.118
They'll use it as evidence,

26:51.119 --> 26:53.740
and I'll have to beg the prosecutor to have a look at it.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.659
Eventually, we'll only get to see the footage...

26:56.660 --> 26:59.170
once your trial begins.

27:00.329 --> 27:01.420
I said...

27:02.420 --> 27:06.210
I didn't do it because it really wasn't me.

27:08.049 --> 27:10.220
My mom was worried.

27:13.470 --> 27:15.180
You're at it again.

27:17.019 --> 27:18.059
Fine.

27:18.519 --> 27:22.859
Then try putting yourself in the judge's shoes.

27:23.319 --> 27:24.359
All right.

27:25.230 --> 27:27.608
Your fingerprints were found all over the scene.

27:27.609 --> 27:29.608
You had bloodstains all over your body...

27:29.609 --> 27:31.700
and even had a bloody knife in your pocket.

27:32.779 --> 27:34.079
Think about it.

27:35.289 --> 27:37.409
Who do you think killed her?

27:37.410 --> 27:39.868
The man who last saw her alive?

27:39.869 --> 27:42.629
Or someone totally random...

27:42.630 --> 27:44.710
who just happens to be a scumbag?

27:46.759 --> 27:48.548
The "truth" you're telling...

27:48.549 --> 27:52.219
won't help your situation at all.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.008
You really need to tell yourself,

27:54.009 --> 27:56.518
"Darn it. I shouldn't be doing this."

27:56.519 --> 27:58.480
Remember that,

27:59.140 --> 28:00.559
or for the rest of your life...

28:01.690 --> 28:04.650
you're doomed. How many times must I tell you this?

28:05.230 --> 28:09.400
(Holding Cell 2)

28:09.650 --> 28:10.990
Do you...

28:12.160 --> 28:14.829
also think that I killed her?

28:19.200 --> 28:20.460
He won't confess?

28:21.750 --> 28:23.119
With all this solid evidence?

28:25.250 --> 28:27.210
What is the prosecutor saying?

28:28.049 --> 28:29.589
I haven't forwarded the case yet.

28:31.130 --> 28:32.930
I don't think there will be any problems.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.259
What's keeping you?

28:39.599 --> 28:40.730
Shall I just do it?

28:48.109 --> 28:51.109
If we have his confession, it'll be a done deal.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.579
That's what we'll do, then.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.670
I know it's still too early,

29:08.710 --> 29:10.258
but like I've mentioned before,

29:10.259 --> 29:13.130
a good friend of mine is the head of Hansung Group's legal team.

29:13.509 --> 29:15.338
He's looking for a seasoned detective...

29:15.339 --> 29:17.180
with lots of field experience.

29:17.430 --> 29:20.430
You were the only one I could think of, so I told him about you.

29:20.890 --> 29:24.140
But I need some solid achievements to vouch for you.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.690

What is known as atopic dermatitis mainly occurs...

35:14.909 --> 35:16.960
where there is skin-to-skin contact.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.670
Common triggers of this eczema are environmental factors.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.110
Darn it.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.449
Darn...

35:50.780 --> 35:55.079
Keeping it clear of infections is key when treating the eczema.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.468
Yes, it's a goal!

36:14.469 --> 36:17.138
- What a beautiful kick. - Son Heung Min!

36:17.139 --> 36:19.349
Just like that, we're back in the game.

36:53.889 --> 36:56.678
The warrant for the arrest of the suspect...

36:56.679 --> 37:00.388
in the Chrysanthemum Murder Case will be validated today.

37:00.389 --> 37:02.268
The suspect who now has...

37:02.269 --> 37:04.098
an arrest warrant requested against him...

37:04.099 --> 37:06.689
will be considered a defendant by the Seoul District Court.

37:06.690 --> 37:08.820
Whether he'll be reprimanded will be decided today.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.899
The suspect drove his father's taxi...

37:11.900 --> 37:13.158
on the pretence of being in business.

37:13.159 --> 37:16.238
He then accepted the female victim as a passenger...

37:16.239 --> 37:17.909
and drove her home.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.578
Once they were at her residence,

37:19.579 --> 37:21.868
he raped and murdered her.

37:21.869 --> 37:24.249
He was caught while driving away from the scene.

37:24.250 --> 37:27.879
During the initial arrest, nearby the crime scene...

37:27.880 --> 37:29.879
(The woman I used to love)

37:29.880 --> 37:32.218
- Hello? What is it? - Why would I talk to Dad?

37:32.219 --> 37:34.379
- You talk to him. - He said he'd buy it for you.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.340
I wasn't the one who promised.

37:36.969 --> 37:38.348
Whatever!

37:38.349 --> 37:39.849
Don't buy it for me if you don't want to.

37:40.139 --> 37:41.349
You haven't finished your meal.

37:41.730 --> 37:42.730
Hae In!

37:43.099 --> 37:44.480
Thanks for breakfast.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.359
Did you hear that?

37:55.360 --> 37:58.449
Was that about the violin she mentioned some time ago?

37:59.199 --> 38:01.328
Buy it for her. It's not like it costs a fortune.

38:01.329 --> 38:02.659
Besides, her dad's a lawyer.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.630
You didn't send last month's child support.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.039
Is that so?

38:09.920 --> 38:12.300
Sorry about that. Things have been hectic lately.

38:12.670 --> 38:13.968
I'll send it during the week.

38:13.969 --> 38:17.260
Mr. Shin Joong Han, do you even know what grade...

38:19.139 --> 38:20.428
your daughter is in?

38:20.429 --> 38:23.099
Of course. As if I wouldn't know.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.519
Darn.

38:26.980 --> 38:28.099
She's in elementary school.

38:30.269 --> 38:31.780
She goes to middle school next year.

38:32.070 --> 38:33.279
I'm up to my neck paying for her academy classes,

38:33.280 --> 38:34.280
so send the money soon.

38:34.281 --> 38:36.489
Okay, I got it. I will...

38:39.619 --> 38:41.738
(Get off Work on Time)

38:41.739 --> 38:43.369
Unbelievable.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.989
I hope they fit.

39:19.949 --> 39:22.158
What about my own clothes?

39:22.159 --> 39:23.239
They're evidence.

39:31.460 --> 39:34.339
(Detective)

39:34.340 --> 39:37.169
Hyun Soo, don't worry too much. Hold on a second.

39:37.170 --> 39:38.260
What is it?

39:40.139 --> 39:42.428
What is he wearing?

39:42.429 --> 39:44.138
(Detective)

39:44.139 --> 39:46.559
You just had to put him in this, didn't you?

39:47.559 --> 39:49.018
I get what you're after,

39:49.019 --> 39:50.479
but at least give him something decent to wear.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.439
Must you play dirty?

39:52.440 --> 39:54.149
We made sure it was something decent.

39:54.150 --> 39:55.569
Anyway, we don't have time for this.

39:55.570 --> 39:57.649
Hey. Hyun Soo, listen.

39:57.650 --> 39:59.779
Don't say anything until you're in court.

39:59.780 --> 40:00.859
Aren't you coming with me?

40:00.860 --> 40:02.658
I'll get there myself, so stay energized.

40:02.659 --> 40:04.279
It'll be all right, okay?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.538
- Over here! - Do you have anything to say?

40:06.539 --> 40:08.499
- Why did you kill her? - Do you feel remorse?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.038
- Please say a few words. - Over here!

40:10.039 --> 40:11.749
- Wait. - Hold on.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.669
- Any words? - How do you feel right now?

40:13.670 --> 40:16.090
- Please say a few words. - How do you feel?

40:16.300 --> 40:18.799
- Why did you do it? - Any words?

40:18.800 --> 40:20.589
- Please say a few words. - Over here!

40:20.590 --> 40:21.799
- Just a second. - Wait!

40:21.800 --> 40:24.219
- How do you feel right now? - Why did you do it?

40:25.760 --> 40:27.888
Do you admit to the charges?

40:27.889 --> 40:29.678
Please say a few words!

40:29.679 --> 40:31.230
Don't you have anything to say?

40:31.769 --> 40:32.980
Please say a few words!

40:33.730 --> 40:35.400
A few words will do.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.030
Are you good?

40:38.820 --> 40:40.570
Hey, sit back and be quiet.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.159
Come on. Let's get moving!

40:49.829 --> 40:50.909
I'll get going.

41:03.340 --> 41:06.559
Mom, the police are here. What do we do?

41:07.929 --> 41:10.639
(Police)

41:12.349 --> 41:13.809
What is this about?

41:17.940 --> 41:19.440
Here's a search and seizure warrant.

41:20.780 --> 41:22.530
Excuse us then. Come on!

41:22.860 --> 41:23.860
But...

41:24.610 --> 41:25.820
Hurry on inside.

41:26.449 --> 41:27.908
Each take a room...

41:27.909 --> 41:29.119
and someone pack this dresser.

41:29.369 --> 41:30.369
Search the trash as well.

41:30.369 --> 41:31.369
Yes, sir.

41:32.119 --> 41:33.289
Hold on.

41:34.170 --> 41:35.170
No, don't.

41:35.171 --> 41:38.249
- There's nothing there. - Collect prescription drugs...

41:38.250 --> 41:41.339
and the hard drive from tablets, laptops, and desktops.

41:41.340 --> 41:43.510
- Yes, sir. - Hey, that's mine!

41:43.880 --> 41:45.638
Goodness. I apologize.

41:45.639 --> 41:47.049
But that's mine!

41:47.050 --> 41:48.638
How am I supposed to study?

41:48.639 --> 41:50.639
Dad, tell them to stop!

42:26.969 --> 42:30.969
(Yangjae)

42:58.960 --> 43:01.130
(Way Out)

43:06.929 --> 43:10.929
(Claims that he's innocent, Didn't try to destroy evidence)

43:20.559 --> 43:26.239
(Only circumstantial evidence)

43:54.179 --> 43:56.479
(Fingerprints on the glass and the liquor bottle)

43:56.480 --> 43:58.189
The suspect and victim's prints and bloodstains were found...

43:58.190 --> 43:59.900
all over the scene.

44:02.809 --> 44:05.230
The suspect had a knife covered with the victim's blood.

44:07.239 --> 44:08.320
And...

44:08.530 --> 44:11.699
we're still waiting for the results from the NFS lab,

44:12.699 --> 44:15.369
but drugs were detected in his urine.

44:15.949 --> 44:19.408
Immediately after the incident, he was seen fleeing in a taxi.

44:19.409 --> 44:20.869
(Suspect Fleeing the Scene)

44:22.460 --> 44:23.670
Witness 1.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.169
Yoo Seung Hoon, a neighbour.

44:25.170 --> 44:27.210
He saw them at around 11pm.

44:28.260 --> 44:29.969
Witness 2 is Ha No Seok.

44:30.219 --> 44:32.639
He witnessed Kim Hyun Soo fleeing Hong Guk Hwa's home.

44:34.050 --> 44:36.469
Kim Hyun Soo denies killing her...

44:36.849 --> 44:38.519
but has admitted to everything else.

44:39.019 --> 44:41.059
So we don't have his confession that he killed her.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.779
This wound on the victim's hand...

44:46.780 --> 44:48.820
proves that the two of them had a fight.

44:50.199 --> 44:51.319
And there's this.

44:51.320 --> 44:52.360
(Attempt to Destroy Evidence)

44:53.070 --> 44:54.449
He attempted to destroy evidence.

44:55.659 --> 44:58.159
I think we have more than enough to indict him.

44:58.699 --> 44:59.960
Are you sure?

45:01.500 --> 45:03.209
I can't be more confident.

45:03.210 --> 45:05.039
It took you three seconds to say that.

45:07.750 --> 45:09.380
Is something bothering you?

45:10.380 --> 45:11.550
Well...

45:13.389 --> 45:14.889
Maybe the fact that Kim Hyun Soo...

45:15.429 --> 45:17.889
is just an ordinary college student with no prior.

45:20.599 --> 45:21.690
Come on.

45:22.190 --> 45:25.559
No one is born a murderer.

45:25.690 --> 45:26.769
My point exactly.

45:27.110 --> 45:28.860
If I lose this case...

45:30.900 --> 45:31.988
What would be the reason?

45:31.989 --> 45:33.409
That won't happen.

45:34.780 --> 45:36.320
This is strange.

45:41.289 --> 45:43.000
This is so unlike you.

45:43.539 --> 45:45.210
What makes you so sure?

45:47.750 --> 45:49.340
(Prosecutor An Tae Hee)

45:49.460 --> 45:50.670
Come in.

46:08.110 --> 46:09.860
My goodness.

46:13.110 --> 46:16.030
Long time no see, Prosecutor An.

46:21.289 --> 46:25.539
My gosh. Indeed, it's been so long, Mr. Shin.

46:27.039 --> 46:29.749
My goodness. You should get going. I'll be in touch.

46:29.750 --> 46:30.840
All right.

46:32.550 --> 46:33.840
Bye.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.678
So? How's your foot?

46:38.679 --> 46:40.429
The same.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.309
Do you know a good doctor?

46:43.559 --> 46:45.939
Look at this. It's not getting better.

46:45.940 --> 46:47.019
My gosh.

47:17.469 --> 47:20.050
The review of the warrant...

47:20.760 --> 47:23.679
isn't done to determine whether or not you're guilty.

47:24.139 --> 47:26.018
Right now, all they have is circumstantial evidence,

47:26.019 --> 47:27.638
which isn't enough.

47:27.639 --> 47:29.979
So the prosecutor has to investigate this further,

47:29.980 --> 47:32.518
and the court needs to decide whether or not...

47:32.519 --> 47:34.190
they'll keep you detained.

47:35.190 --> 47:36.739
This shouldn't happen,

47:37.739 --> 47:40.320
but even if they decide to issue an arrest warrant,

47:40.820 --> 47:42.530
don't worry too much.

47:42.949 --> 47:44.329
It doesn't mean it's over.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.090
Where did you get it?

48:00.719 --> 48:01.760
This...

48:02.599 --> 48:04.599
Detective Park Sang Bum gave me this.

48:06.679 --> 48:07.769
Really?

48:08.690 --> 48:11.269
That's odd. That's out of his character.

48:13.059 --> 48:15.400
- Please get ready. - Sure.

48:49.599 --> 48:50.980
All rise.

48:54.820 --> 48:56.900
(Court)

49:00.570 --> 49:01.989
Please be seated.

49:06.989 --> 49:09.909
Case Number 2021HJ235935.

49:10.079 --> 49:12.170
The accused is Kim Hyun Soo. We will begin now.

49:13.119 --> 49:14.130
Stand up and bow.

49:17.050 --> 49:19.089
The accused may remain silent...

49:19.090 --> 49:21.259
and may refuse to answer questions.

49:21.260 --> 49:23.218
Even if you refuse to answer a question,

49:23.219 --> 49:25.719
it will not be used against you.

49:26.139 --> 49:27.679
Mr. Kim, you may be seated.

49:30.980 --> 49:32.730
Let's hear from the prosecution first.

49:33.230 --> 49:34.440
Well...

49:36.059 --> 49:37.610
This is a serious case.

49:40.239 --> 49:44.569
There are 117 pieces of evidence,

49:44.570 --> 49:46.530
which prove that the accused is guilty of the murder.

49:47.079 --> 49:49.788
However, Mr. Kim is still denying the murder.

49:49.789 --> 49:51.368
He resisted arrest.

49:51.369 --> 49:54.460
He tampered with the crime scene and tried to destroy evidence.

49:54.619 --> 49:58.089
Furthermore, this is a serious crime...

49:58.090 --> 50:00.210
that can result in the heaviest penalty,

50:00.510 --> 50:02.170
so we're concerned he'd try to flee.

50:02.800 --> 50:06.719
As you know, this case is all over the news at the moment,

50:07.099 --> 50:09.849
so we believe that he should be isolated.

50:09.969 --> 50:11.889
Ergo, we request that he be detained.

50:26.070 --> 50:27.320
Mr. Kim.

50:28.449 --> 50:29.449
Yes, Your Honour.

50:30.829 --> 50:34.369
Did you kill Ms. Hong Guk Hwa?

50:48.599 --> 50:49.599
No.

50:50.849 --> 50:52.059
I did not.

50:53.349 --> 50:54.389
I...

50:56.019 --> 50:58.519
We had a few drinks together,

50:59.360 --> 51:01.190
and I fell asleep. When I woke up,

51:03.989 --> 51:06.149
I found her like that.

51:06.150 --> 51:09.949
So you do not admit to the charges.

51:12.239 --> 51:13.289
Correct.

51:16.619 --> 51:17.710
Counsel.

51:19.329 --> 51:22.340
Mr. Kim's situation isn't looking good.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.139
Right.

51:30.550 --> 51:33.349
That may be the case now.

51:34.559 --> 51:36.519
However, the supplementary investigation...

51:36.730 --> 51:40.650
will prove that Mr. Kim is not guilty.

51:41.019 --> 51:44.650
I believe that he should be released...

51:44.940 --> 51:46.859
so he can be fully prepared for his trial.

51:46.860 --> 51:49.779
Mr. Kim truly hopes...

51:49.780 --> 51:53.288
to prove his innocence through the trial,

51:53.289 --> 51:54.999
so I can assure you...

51:55.000 --> 51:57.619
that the prosecution needn't be concerned...

51:57.750 --> 52:00.210
that he'd flee.

52:00.710 --> 52:01.750
I see.

52:02.789 --> 52:04.710
I will review everything carefully.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.380
Your Honour.

52:08.429 --> 52:13.050
Mr. Kim has been living an exemplary life.

52:13.260 --> 52:16.929
He is a college student with a clean record.

52:17.230 --> 52:19.899
The prosecution believes he should be indicted...

52:19.900 --> 52:22.110
based on circumstantial evidence and the witnesses' statements,

52:22.400 --> 52:24.769
but not a single person...

52:25.570 --> 52:27.238
actually witnessed the murder.

52:27.239 --> 52:29.780
I trust...

52:29.949 --> 52:32.320
that you will make a wise decision, Your Honour.

52:32.869 --> 52:33.949
Your Honour.

52:39.119 --> 52:40.829
The victim of this case...

52:43.079 --> 52:45.090
is an innocent woman,

52:46.920 --> 52:49.670
and she was stabbed 13 times.

52:54.599 --> 52:56.468
I'd like to once again emphasize...

52:56.469 --> 52:58.349
the severity and the brutality of the crime.

52:59.019 --> 53:00.059
Okay.

53:00.639 --> 53:02.650
I understand both points of view.

53:03.059 --> 53:05.360
That concludes the hearing for the warrant validation.

53:07.480 --> 53:08.570
Mr. Shin?

53:18.699 --> 53:20.289
Are you sure about this case?

53:20.750 --> 53:22.039
It's getting a lot of attention.

53:23.880 --> 53:26.500
Being a lawyer and all, I shouldn't back out.

53:27.210 --> 53:28.840
I'm concerned, that's all.

53:29.130 --> 53:31.130
I appreciate your concern, Your Honour.

53:32.260 --> 53:34.339
All right. I'll look forward to it then.

53:34.340 --> 53:35.349
Sure.

53:40.349 --> 53:42.019
Hyun...

53:55.699 --> 53:56.780
How was it today?

53:57.199 --> 53:58.698
Give me the scoop.

53:58.699 --> 54:00.078
Mind your own business.

54:00.079 --> 54:03.209
How on earth can I? Just tell me how it was.

54:03.210 --> 54:04.329
Kang Da Kyung.

54:05.289 --> 54:07.879
That article you wrote...

54:07.880 --> 54:10.880
was the same as a guilty verdict.

54:11.719 --> 54:14.050
As a reporter, don't you have...

54:14.300 --> 54:17.719
a sense of responsibility or a guilty conscience?

54:18.010 --> 54:19.638
I feel bad too,

54:19.639 --> 54:22.019
but others would've written it if I hadn't.

54:23.309 --> 54:24.309
Look.

54:24.769 --> 54:26.649
A girl as pretty as a movie star...

54:26.650 --> 54:28.018
had a one-night stand...

54:28.019 --> 54:29.900
and was stabbed 13 times.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.940
- Of course people are all over it. - Stop that.

54:33.530 --> 54:34.530
Look for yourself.

54:34.531 --> 54:36.199
How did it go?

54:37.909 --> 54:39.948
Did the defendant plead guilty?

54:39.949 --> 54:41.500
What did he say?

54:41.869 --> 54:43.828
- How did it go? - Can you say a few words?

54:43.829 --> 54:45.169
- What are your predictions? - How will it go?

54:45.170 --> 54:47.379
- Thank you, all. - Please say a few words.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.170
She's having a field day.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.919
- Ms. An, wait! - Hold on.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.550
Ms. An, just a second.

55:25.079 --> 55:27.869
How... did it go?

55:56.150 --> 55:58.488
It wasn't me.

55:58.489 --> 55:59.659
I didn't do it.

56:00.239 --> 56:03.659
I really didn't do it.

56:04.039 --> 56:06.159
I didn't do this.

56:17.300 --> 56:19.889
Shoot, goal in!

56:22.760 --> 56:26.389
- Goal in! - Goal in!
