Boy, ain’t nobody thinking

McGarrett’s team’s in the lead.

Whoa!

TANI: That’s a touchdown.
Seven-seven.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.072
Score’s all tied up now.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.440
Go, go, go!
(all shouting)

02:58.945 --> 03:01.448
Just jump a little. Just...

03:01.448 --> 03:03.417
Oh, you’re really missing
Grover out there, huh?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.118
What is that supposed to mean?
I’m just saying,

03:05.118 --> 03:07.254
having a big six-foot-five
target’s really, really masked

03:07.254 --> 03:09.589
a lot of your accuracy
issues over the...
Okay. That’s good.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.425
If you want to concede
right now, it might
be less embarrassing.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.926
Embarrassing? I’ll tell you
what’s gonna be embarrassing.
Yeah.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.461
What? What?
When Danny gets back
from New Jersey

03:14.461 --> 03:16.463
Uh-huh.
and figures out that
you QB’d his team into a loss.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.031
MAMO: That’s a
turnover on downs.
Yeah, keep talking.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.101
Still tie game, and I got to go,
so next score wins.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.302
All right, defense, let’s go.
Huddle up.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.438
All right, Noelani,
you’re on Koa this play.

03:24.438 --> 03:27.674
Got it. I’ll be all over him
like actinic keratosis.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.278
It’s a skin condition.
Nasty stuff.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.712
Jerry, come on, man, you got
to get some pressure on Tani.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.381
STEVE: She’s got
all day in the pocket.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.650
She’s like a ghost out there.
Yeah. I’m trying.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.285
But Kamekona and Flippa
are like the Great Wall.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.453
Guys, the real problem
is Junior.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.288
He’s been burning us all day.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.623
You’re trying to say that
I’m the problem-- my
defense is the problem?

03:43.623 --> 03:45.225
’Cause you can just say it.
NOELANI: Yeah, well, y-you...

03:45.225 --> 03:47.727
maybe you want to try, you know,
some bump and run coverage,

03:47.727 --> 03:49.096
extend your arms,
throw off his route.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.599
My boyfriend’s a coach.
We talk shop.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.401
STEVE:
Okay. All right.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.303
Flippa, you missed your blocking
assignment last possession.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.838
You left my blind side
wide open. What are you doing?

03:57.838 --> 04:00.540
What assignment? I thought
we just stand there and be big?

04:00.540 --> 04:03.043
No, you were supposed
to pull and block Noelani.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.578
KAMEKONA:
The only thing he gonna pull

04:04.578 --> 04:06.480
is a hamstring
if you ask him to run.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.381
All right, enough water. Put the
water down, put the water down.

04:08.381 --> 04:13.487
Okay? Here’s what we’re doing.
Zebra wide 35, waggle X.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.222
Give me the eyes,
give me the eyes. Ready?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.389
No.
ALL: Break!

04:16.389 --> 04:18.592
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

04:18.592 --> 04:22.863
Hey, Koa, was she always this
competitive when she as a kid?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.831
Only until she was about eight.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.133
After that, no one
would play with her.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.036
Yellow, yellow! Hot route. Hike!

04:31.138 --> 04:32.472
(all shouting)

04:38.645 --> 04:40.247
Yes! (whooping)

04:40.247 --> 04:41.314
(others cheering)

04:41.314 --> 04:43.250
(whistle blows)

04:43.250 --> 04:44.985
Out of bounds! No catch.
TANI: What...?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.086
What?!

04:46.086 --> 04:47.521
Junior failed
to establish possession

04:47.521 --> 04:48.688
before going out of bounds.
Wha...

04:48.688 --> 04:50.590
No!
STEVE:
Thank you, Mamo.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.059
That is the correct call.
That is a terrible ca...

04:53.059 --> 04:54.761
(stammers) That’s a terrible
call. That’s a terrible call.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.997
Don’t listen to her.
As if you could
see anything

04:56.997 --> 04:58.431
through your cataracts,
you old man.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.966
Hey, hey, hey.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.968
Time-out.
Trash talking is one thing.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.704
Mamo is very graciously
giving us his time this morning.

05:04.704 --> 05:06.673
No. Oh, my God, no, I-I would
never talk like that to Mamo.

05:06.673 --> 05:07.607
I was talking to you.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.244
Come on. Second down. Let’s go.
(phone ringing)

05:11.244 --> 05:12.946
Keep it moving.
Hold on, hold on.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.047
McGarrett.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.718
Yeah. We’re on the way.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.054
What?

05:21.054 --> 05:23.190
They haven’t even
been here 24 hours yet,

05:23.190 --> 05:26.092
and I’m already
going out of my damn mind.

05:26.092 --> 05:29.095
And please, don’t say
"I told you so," babe.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.997
Baby, I’d never do that.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.300
Your family is my family.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.468
Oh, you’re a good wife,
sweetheart. I love you.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.205
You know, my family I can
handle, but that damn Percy.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.574
Uh, come on, baby,
he’s not that bad.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.909
Yeah, he’s the worst.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.612
But he is not gonna
ruin this holiday.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.147
(chuckles)

05:47.147 --> 05:48.548
Thanksgiving brunch
is on deck,

05:48.548 --> 05:51.451
and the master chef
is about to throw down.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.620
Mm-hmm. See, now that’s my man.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.288
Oh, you sweet.
Mm.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.457
Everything’s gonna
be fine, baby.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.259
I know.
(both laugh)

05:59.259 --> 06:01.194
But I did tell you so.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.899
This family ain’t nothing
but a pack of wolves.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.805
STEVE: The catch only counts if
possession is made in bounds.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.174
Which it did. Junior caught
the ball in the end zone.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.875
Tani, I’m over it.
You should be, too.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.644
He’s right, Tani. Nobody
likes a sore loser.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.179
Uh, excuse me, we tied.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.714
A sore tie-er, then.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.383
Oh. Okay.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.453
That’s, uh, something
I haven’t seen before.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.725
LUKELA: Sorry I
couldn’t make the game.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.426
Um, how’d it go?

06:33.426 --> 06:34.794
We were robbed.
STEVE: Well, let’s, uh,

06:34.794 --> 06:36.763
leave that crime back there and
focus on this one for now.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.298
Duke, what are
we looking at,

06:38.298 --> 06:40.967
aside the obvious safe
on top of the person?

06:40.967 --> 06:42.836
LUKELA: Homeowners are out
of town for the holiday.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.005
Housekeeper arrives this morning

06:45.005 --> 06:46.273
to find this mess.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.742
Broken back door looks to be
the point of entry.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.543
Perp went upstairs,
took this safe

06:50.543 --> 06:52.712
out of the wall
in the master bedroom.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.347
Got an I.D. on this guy?
Michael Chan.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.049
He’s got priors and a day job

06:56.049 --> 06:58.218
working for an airport
shuttle service.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.053
ADAM: So he picks people up
at these fancy homes

07:00.053 --> 07:01.855
and knows they’re
going out of town.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.723
That’s pretty smart.
He’s not smart. He’s stupid.

07:03.723 --> 07:06.259
He tried to smuggle this
ginormous safe out the door?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.761
A classic amateur move.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.729
Yeah, but it looks like
he might have tried to use

07:09.729 --> 07:11.197
this blanket
to drag the safe down.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.566
But when he tried pulling it
down one step at a time,

07:13.566 --> 07:15.235
gravity did its thing.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.603
(grunts)

07:16.603 --> 07:18.505
(shouts)
(sharp crunch)

07:18.505 --> 07:20.940
Safe fell on top
of him and smoosh.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.777
STEVE: Guys, check out
the drill marks.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.046
I’m thinking this guy, uh, tried
to crack the safe upstairs

07:26.046 --> 07:27.747
before he decided
to take it to go.

07:27.747 --> 07:31.351
Close, but not quite.
Come check this out.

07:31.351 --> 07:34.487
We found metal shavings
next to the body,

07:34.487 --> 07:37.223
indicating that
the safe was drilled

07:37.223 --> 07:39.192
right here on
top of the guy.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.794
There was more than one thief.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.228
STEVE:
So Plan A was

07:42.228 --> 07:44.798
to get this thing out of here
and crack it someplace else.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.366
But then it falls
on bad guy number one,

07:46.366 --> 07:48.068
and his partner realizes
he can’t carry it by himself,

07:48.068 --> 07:50.070
so he’s gonna drill it
right here in place?

07:51.871 --> 07:53.540
Bad news, he lost a partner.

07:53.540 --> 07:56.009
Good news, he doesn’t
have to split the take.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.599
What in the hell is that?

08:19.599 --> 08:21.468
Dry wall mix?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.637
It’s kouign-amann,
you fat dummy.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.707
You pretentious ass.
Them ain’t even words.

08:27.707 --> 08:30.510
It’s a French pastry,
you troglodyte.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.045
That ain’t a word, either.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.882
Yeah? Well, it’s better than
those soggy, limp-ass omelets

08:35.882 --> 08:37.350
you be making.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.620
Just ’cause you big as a house
don’t make you Emeril Lagasse,

08:40.620 --> 08:41.821
Chubster.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.693
Don’t call me that again, man.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.595
(bowl thuds)

08:48.595 --> 08:50.063
Or what?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.333
(quietly):
Hey, pretty girl.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.734
Hey, baby.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.302
(chuckles)

08:56.302 --> 08:58.772
Mm. Mm, mm.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.939
(laughs)

08:59.939 --> 09:02.509
(pots clattering)

09:02.509 --> 09:04.978
GROVER: Is that all you got,
fool? You come to my house?
PERCY: You hungry, son?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.216
Oh, I got something...
RENEE: Hey, hey, hey!

09:11.818 --> 09:13.353
What the hell is going on here?

09:13.353 --> 09:14.988
Nothing.
(laughs):
Oh, no.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.823
You know, this could be funny,

09:16.823 --> 09:18.358
if both of you weren’t
grown men.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.194
WILL:
Shoot, it’s funny to me.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.163
You guys need a reality show.
Will.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.899
Both of you,
upstairs and clean up.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.268
Mm.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.637
STEVE:
Hey.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.605
We I.D. our vic’s accomplice?

09:32.605 --> 09:35.341
Jerry ran Chan on all
our available databases,

09:35.341 --> 09:36.843
came up empty
on any known associates.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.645
Right now,
we’re dumping his phone,

09:38.645 --> 09:40.046
so hopefully
that can get us a lead

09:40.046 --> 09:41.448
on who he might’ve
pulled this job with.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.917
Whoever it was, they left
a lot of valuable stuff behind.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.952
A handgun, couple Rolexes.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.554
JUNIOR: That’s quick
money in any pawnshop.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.422
Maybe he had
to leave in a hurry.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.723
Unless he was for looking
for something specific.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.292
We’ve reached out
to the homeowners, right?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.727
They should be able to tell us
exactly what was missing.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.062
(exhales)

09:56.062 --> 09:58.198
The safe wasn’t
the only thing they hit.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.666
Found a bag upstairs,
was full of jewelry

09:59.666 --> 10:02.702
sterling silver and a laptop.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.003
ADAM: If this crew was
after something specific

10:04.003 --> 10:06.673
in the safe, why did they
bother filling a bag

10:06.673 --> 10:08.675
with other random valuables
and then leave it behind?

10:08.675 --> 10:10.844
Well, because it wasn’t
a crew at all.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.679
What do you mean?

10:12.679 --> 10:13.847
I found another point
of entry upstairs,

10:13.847 --> 10:15.315
which leads me to believe

10:15.315 --> 10:17.984
that this wasn’t one team
hitting this house together.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.319
STEVE:
Wait a minute.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.720
You’re saying there was
two separate thieves

10:20.720 --> 10:22.489
that hit the same house
on the same night?

10:23.590 --> 10:26.092
GROVER:
And now my delicious omelets.

10:26.092 --> 10:27.927
Hey, listen,
I just wanted to say, Renee,

10:27.927 --> 10:29.729
you’re just
as beautiful today

10:29.729 --> 10:31.397
as you were
when you two got married.

10:31.397 --> 10:34.267
Aw. Thank you.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.336
Boy, stop filling my wife’s head
with nonsense.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.641
Wait. Babe, come on.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.676
I-I don’t mean,
like, nonsense...
Mm, mm, mm.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.245
Shut up.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.346
I-I’m just saying,

10:46.346 --> 10:48.414
he’s full of it.

10:48.414 --> 10:51.017
Son, when you’re standing
in the hole, quit digging.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.753
(timer ringing)
(mocking): Stop digging.

10:53.753 --> 10:54.754
(Ella laughs)

10:54.754 --> 10:56.356
(sniffs) Mmm!

10:56.356 --> 10:58.458
What is that smell?

10:58.458 --> 11:00.260
Whatever it is,
I want some.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.828
Percy. (gasps)

11:01.828 --> 11:03.997
Oh, did you make
kouign-amann? Yes.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.965
Wait, that’s a real thing?
Oh, baby,

11:05.965 --> 11:07.267
it is the only thing.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.068
Oh, bring it here. Yes, yes.

11:09.068 --> 11:12.772
Come to mama.
Mmm! Oh, yeah.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.440
(laughs)

11:14.440 --> 11:17.577
Mmm! What is that?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.379
Lemon curd?
PERCY: Mm-hmm.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.015
Mm... Mint.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.149
And what is that?

11:23.149 --> 11:24.984
Thyme.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.753
See, that’s my
secret weapon.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.388
Adds a little savory

11:28.388 --> 11:30.790
to the sweetness. (laughing)
ELLA: All right.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.293
RENEE:
Mmm, Percy.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.862
I am not even kidding, you
need to open your own bakery.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.497
He does.
Right?

11:37.497 --> 11:38.464
He should.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.333
It would never happen.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.635
Why would you say
something like that, Pop?

11:42.635 --> 11:45.638
Well, you don’t open your eyes
until 2:00 in the afternoon.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.373
I mean... (chuckles)

11:47.373 --> 11:48.575
you’d be sleeping now

11:48.575 --> 11:50.176
if we wasn’t five hours
from Chicago time.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.844
It just so happens,

11:51.844 --> 11:55.315
I met with a banker
at First Chicago

11:55.315 --> 11:56.749
about a business loan
just this week.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.518
All right.
Yeah.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.919
That’s good news, L’il Percy.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.255
Really good news!

12:02.255 --> 12:03.489
Congratulations.

12:03.489 --> 12:07.393
Congratu-- On what?
A conversation?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.761
They must be over
there giving out

12:08.761 --> 12:10.663
play money if they
give him a loan.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.931
Lou, be nice.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.702
RENEE: Baby, what time do you
need to pick up the turkey?

12:15.702 --> 12:18.504
Huh? Oh-- Oh, yeah.
I got to go to Foodland.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.573
They got ours on hold.
PERCY: Yeah, h-hold up.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.841
I need to roll with you.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.978
Because I’m real, real picky
about my ingredients.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.012
Ingredients for what?

12:26.012 --> 12:28.448
It’s Thanksgiving, dum-dum.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.149
I plan on cooking dinner.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.251
You plan on paying the mortgage
up in here, too?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.653
’Cause this is
my house.
Oh, man.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.422
Any-any turkey and gravy and
giblets or any other damn thing

12:36.422 --> 12:38.725
gets cooked up in here
is gonna be by me.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.959
ELLA:
You know what?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.928
I got an idea.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.597
Why don’t you two
cook dinner together?

12:45.865 --> 12:46.966
GROVER:
Because this is

12:46.966 --> 12:48.434
my house.
(groans)

12:48.434 --> 12:50.937
Dang, Ma, why you always
siding with him?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.039
I’m not siding
with him.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.475
I’m siding with
the family.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.578
This is what?
Thanksgiving.

12:58.578 --> 13:02.115
You two should be
thankful for each other.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.950
(softly): As I’ve been
trying to tell...

13:03.950 --> 13:05.218
You got something to say,
L’il Percy?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.222
No, ma’am.
(Grover snickers)

13:09.222 --> 13:12.425
Well, I think it’s
a great idea. You and I...
Me, too, baby.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.162
(laughs) We do.
Baby.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.366
Fine.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.103
(over radio):
♪ Turkey for you ♪

13:24.103 --> 13:29.308
♪ Let’s eat the turkey
in my big brown shoe... ♪

13:29.308 --> 13:31.411
Let me tell you something,
little brother.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.880
Jealousy is a ugly cloak.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.150
And I’m surprised
it can even fit your fat ass.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
(chuckles)

13:39.152 --> 13:41.154
Tell you what, Chubby-Chub.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.322
Let’s make this thing
interesting.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.824
We cook up two birds,

13:44.824 --> 13:48.594
and let the fam decide
which one is the best.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.430
Cool?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.098
Unless, of course,
you’re scared.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.733
Like you used to be
when them bullies

13:53.733 --> 13:56.436
would chase your ass home...
Bet! Bet.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.871
Bet. Name your stakes, loser.
(laughs)

13:58.871 --> 14:01.207
All right.

14:01.207 --> 14:06.045
When I win, you admit
that I’m the better chef.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.814
(scoffs)
A’ight?

14:07.814 --> 14:11.651
And you cosign
a loan for my bakery.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.352
Fine, that’ll work.
Cool.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.988
Yeah. And when you lose,

14:15.988 --> 14:17.924
then I don’t have
to see your ass

14:17.924 --> 14:21.327
at my Thanksgiving table
for two years.

14:21.327 --> 14:24.864
Why don’t we make it
22 years, fat ass?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.400
Hell, I hope I never have to
show up around here again.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.469
Ooh. Done.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.712
♪ It’s not good,
not good to fight, yeah... ♪

14:39.712 --> 14:41.748
(register beeps)

14:41.748 --> 14:44.050
That’ll be $307.21.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.355
Um, seems as though

14:49.355 --> 14:51.224
I forgot my wallet.
No, he didn’t.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.425
It’s right in
his back pocket.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.095
You see, what he
actually forgot is money.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.732
But he’s family.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.801
You do things for your family.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.936
(chuckles) You know
how that is, right?

15:03.936 --> 15:06.372
(chuckles)
Hey, for real?

15:06.372 --> 15:07.707
Thank you, little brother.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.675
Yeah, don’t get all sentimental.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.845
That just puts me $300 closer
to getting rid of your ass.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.715
So, where’s your turkey?

15:15.715 --> 15:18.618
It seems as though
they’re sold out.

15:18.618 --> 15:22.922
But don’t get any bright ideas
about victory by default.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.425
Because we gonna keep shopping.
Good luck.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.162
Come again?

15:29.162 --> 15:32.298
What she means is
you ain’t in Chicago, dummy.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.233
This is an island.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.169
Anybody who wanted
a Thanksgiving turkey

15:36.169 --> 15:38.204
already has one.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.872
Like this baby right here.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.776
Who’s getting to be
nice and juicy, hmm?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.044
Who?

15:45.044 --> 15:47.246
You ain’t getting off
that easy. A bet’s a bet.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.816
I just so happen to know a guy

15:49.816 --> 15:52.151
who can pretty much
get anything.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.920
(phone speed dials)

15:58.524 --> 16:01.294
(brakes squeal,
gearshift creaks)

16:02.428 --> 16:04.630
Chi-Town.
GROVER: My man.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.500
Behold: a Hawaiian
Thanksgiving miracle.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.669
(turkey gobbles)
Perfect.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.270
What?
(laughing)

16:11.270 --> 16:13.239
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

16:13.239 --> 16:15.374
What you mean, brah?

16:15.374 --> 16:17.476
Kill him, pluck
him, cook him.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.312
It don’t get
no better than this

16:19.312 --> 16:20.947
on a last-minute notice.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.082
(laughing)
Full disclosure,

16:23.082 --> 16:24.317
this guy was bred to fight.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.252
Lean and mean.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.321
His meat might be kind of tough.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.522
(guffawing)

16:29.522 --> 16:32.291
No, no, no, no.
The bet’s off, man.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.826
The bet’s off
for real this time.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.795
Oh, hell no, it ain’t.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.531
You wanted a turkey,
here’s a turkey.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.032
(gobbles)
Be thankful

16:40.032 --> 16:41.334
you don’t have
to defrost it.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.770
That’s right, O.G.
That’ll cost $300.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.938
What?!

16:45.938 --> 16:47.773
(laughs)

16:47.773 --> 16:50.443
What’s so funny?!
The shoe’s on the
other foot now, ain’t it?

16:51.510 --> 16:54.180
Since I forgot money,
it’s on you.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.449
Or the bet’s off.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.885
Tell you what, Chicago,
for another C-note,

16:58.885 --> 17:01.053
I’ll throw in a
humane slaughtering,

17:01.053 --> 17:03.055
get this bugger plucked,
cleaned and dressed.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.190
(gobbles)

17:04.190 --> 17:06.359
$400 for a turkey.
You know what?

17:06.359 --> 17:09.528
It’s gonna be worth it.
$300 for--

17:09.528 --> 17:10.897
Here.
One.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.634
Two. Three. Four!

17:14.634 --> 17:16.969
Oh, yeah, by the way.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.437
You guys like the
head on or off?

17:18.437 --> 17:20.306
GROVER and PERCY:
Off!

17:20.306 --> 17:22.742
Just checking, my bruddahs,
just checking.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.410
Right.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.579
(sportscast playing over TV)
Ah!

17:26.579 --> 17:29.181
28 to nothing, and he wants
to get out the game

17:29.181 --> 17:30.316
’cause his finger hurt.

17:30.316 --> 17:31.951
ANNOUNCER:
...and he did!

17:31.951 --> 17:33.085
(Percy Sr. grunts)

17:33.085 --> 17:37.557
All the candy-ass, weak,
prima donna bull...

17:37.557 --> 17:39.091
Big Percy.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.726
Yes-yes, yes, Miss Ella.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.395
I know you’re not
sitting around in here

17:42.395 --> 17:44.163
using that kind
of language in front of

17:44.163 --> 17:45.932
my grand-baby, are you?

17:45.932 --> 17:48.401
Uh, it just
kind of slipped out,

17:48.401 --> 17:49.402
M-Miss Ella.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.070
Oh, just slipped out?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.305
Yes, ma’am.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.906
(chuckles):
Okay.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.576
Well, can you kind of just
slip into the kitchen

17:56.576 --> 17:59.078
and peel those potatoes
as I asked you to?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.147
(clicks tongue) Got it.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.315
(clears throat)

18:02.315 --> 18:03.549
(grunts)

18:03.549 --> 18:05.318
And by the way.
Hmm?

18:05.318 --> 18:06.919
Yeah, yeah?
Put on your glasses.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.020
Oh.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.389
Look.
Thank you.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.726
Last thing I want to do
is spend my Thanksgiving

18:13.726 --> 18:17.897
in the E.R. because you
sliced off your pinky finger.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.167
No, no, no, no, no, no,
Miss Ella.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.868
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
(laughs)

18:22.868 --> 18:24.971
Yeah.
Yes, Miss Ella.

18:26.505 --> 18:27.573
(chuckles)

18:27.573 --> 18:29.909
(laughing)

18:29.909 --> 18:32.545
Now, what’s so funny?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.080
You got potato duty,
too, now.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.281
Come on, come on.
Get up.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.382
Attention, boy!

18:38.384 --> 18:40.720
Follow me.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.592
(humming a tune)

18:52.198 --> 18:54.233
What’s the matter
with you, boy?

18:54.233 --> 18:56.969
So, you’re scared
of Grandma, huh?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.138
Hey, it’s all right.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.207
Dad’s scared
of Mom, too.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.708
Is that what you think?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.810
Yeah, you know,
everybody knows that.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.513
Even his friends
at work. (chuckles)

19:10.783 --> 19:13.185
Let me tell
you something.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.121
Grandson.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.892
Your grandma, she spent
every waking hour

19:19.892 --> 19:23.896
trying to take care of me and
your daddy and your uncle.

19:23.896 --> 19:28.734
She worked 50 hours a week,
and she still finds time

19:28.734 --> 19:30.736
to cook us dinner
every night.

19:30.736 --> 19:35.207
The most important person
I ever met in my life.

19:35.207 --> 19:38.010
She’s my heart.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.713
And your mama?

19:40.713 --> 19:43.716
Now, she spends every
waking hour of her life

19:43.716 --> 19:47.219
taking care of you and
your daddy and your sister,

19:47.219 --> 19:49.255
and still finds time
to fly back and forth

19:49.255 --> 19:51.457
to Chicago to check
on her parents.

19:51.457 --> 19:56.429
Now, she’s the most important
person that your daddy knows.

19:56.429 --> 20:01.067
Me and your daddy, we spend
every waking hour of our life

20:01.067 --> 20:06.338
trying our best to be
worthy of those women.

20:08.074 --> 20:11.811
So, scared, yeah, yeah,
w-we’re scared all right.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.313
We’re scared of
not measuring up.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.086
In the future,
if you’re lucky,

20:20.086 --> 20:24.957
you’ll find somebody
for you to be scared of.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.059
Say, what’s, uh, that
you young folks say?

20:28.360 --> 20:29.729
You feel me?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.931
(chuckles):
Yeah.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.833
Yeah, I feel you, Grandpa.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.434
Yeah. That’s what
I’m talking about.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.971
Now hand me
another potato, son.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.873
We got work to do.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.176
JERRY:
So I spoke with the homeowners,

20:44.176 --> 20:47.346
and based on the inventory
that Mr. Henman sent over,

20:47.346 --> 20:49.815
the only thing missing
from the safe was this.

20:49.815 --> 20:53.219
One 1948 Stan Musial
baseball card.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.420
A beauty, isn’t she?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.088
Never heard of him.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.057
You’ve never heard
of Stan the Man Musial?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.959
The Donora Greyhound?
No.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.260
Three-time
World Series champion.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.195
.331 career batting average.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.530
National League MVP

21:04.530 --> 21:06.365
in ’43, ’46, and ’48.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.633
No.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.202
Please tell me you read
those stats off of your screen.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.637
The guy was a first-ballot
Hall of Famer.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.038
Not to mention a patriot.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.907
This man walked away
from the game

21:14.907 --> 21:17.476
so he could serve this country
in World War II.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.445
Okay. I’m guessing
if our thief was after

21:19.445 --> 21:22.615
that card specifically,
it must be pretty valuable.

21:22.615 --> 21:27.653
Yeah, I’d say so. Mr. Henman,
he, uh, insured it for over 60K.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.889
60 grand for a piece
of cardboard?

21:29.889 --> 21:33.292
Unless our thief is a Jerry
Ortega-level Stan Musial fan,

21:33.292 --> 21:34.960
we got to assume
that he’s trying

21:34.960 --> 21:36.195
to unload this thing
somewhere, right?

21:36.195 --> 21:38.164
Right. And there’s probably
only a couple dealers

21:38.164 --> 21:41.233
on the island who move
memorabilia this expensive.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.735
Jerry?

21:42.735 --> 21:45.004
You’re assuming I know where
sports nerds waste their money?

21:48.607 --> 21:51.310
All right, there’s one shop
in particular I can think of.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.547
(brakes squeal,
gearshift creaks)

21:54.547 --> 21:55.781
JERRY: Hall of Fame
Sports Collectibles.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.216
That’s the place.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.885
Okay, Jerry. Here’s how I’m
thinking we should play this.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.221
What are you doing?

22:02.221 --> 22:04.890
Making the necessary
preparations for this op.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.994
Uh... Jerry.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.229
(Southern accent):
I’m sorry.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.198
There’s no one here
by that name.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.366
I’m Bill Bachman III,

22:14.366 --> 22:16.836
Southern gentleman,
avid collector

22:16.836 --> 22:20.339
of baseball memorabilia,
lifelong Cardinals fan.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.675
And I’m a man on a mission:

22:22.675 --> 22:26.345
I’m looking for
a 1948 Stan Musial card,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.847
and you bet your
sweet patootie

22:28.847 --> 22:30.849
I’m willing to pay top dollar.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.919
That’s great,

22:33.919 --> 22:38.090
Bill, but-- and this
is just a suggestion--

22:38.090 --> 22:42.194
you might not want to actually
mention Stan Musial.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.929
(normal voice): You think
he might get suspicious?

22:43.929 --> 22:47.266
Asking for the card the same day
some sketchy guy off-loaded it?

22:47.266 --> 22:52.738
Yeah. He’ll know it was stolen,
so he’ll probably be cagey.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.440
Makes sense.
Okay.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.843
Here’s what I was thinking.
I’m your rich friend from Japan

22:57.843 --> 23:00.112
who’s got a passion for
American baseball memorabilia

23:00.112 --> 23:03.349
and money to burn.
Okay, I can dig it.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.984
Yeah?
And who am I?

23:04.984 --> 23:07.620
You’re you.

23:10.656 --> 23:12.591
I think I can do that.

23:22.368 --> 23:24.570
Shoots. You’re not closing,
are you?

23:24.570 --> 23:27.906
Afraid so. Got to get home
to Thanksgiving dinner.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.108
Oh, this will only
take a minute.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.876
My friend here is
on his way back to Japan,

23:30.876 --> 23:33.078
and just wants to get
a gift for his nephew.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.947
Konnichiwa.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.919
Okay. So step inside
for a minute.

23:43.522 --> 23:44.857
What? No!
(lock clicks)

23:44.857 --> 23:45.924
Stay here. Cover the door!

23:45.924 --> 23:48.460
Where are you going?

24:01.473 --> 24:03.742
(grunting)
Come here.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.811
Looks like you won’t be
making that dinner.

Yeah, it was nice.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.781
Tell you what, though.
Mm.

25:15.781 --> 25:18.584
When Will goes
off to college? Mm.

25:18.584 --> 25:19.885
You’ll be in trouble, woman.
(laughs)

25:19.885 --> 25:21.220
You’re so wrong.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.555
You looked so
happy cooking.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.557
I didn’t even want
to disturb you.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.327
Girl, please. Nothing

25:28.327 --> 25:29.661
could disturb me today.

25:29.661 --> 25:31.230
Percy gonna wish he
never made that bet.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.233
Hmm. What bet?

25:34.233 --> 25:37.803
That fool thinks
he’s a better chef than me.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.772
Than me, okay?
(laughs)

25:39.772 --> 25:41.273
So he wanted
to make a bet.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.476
We’ll cook two birds,
and we’ll see which one is best,

25:44.476 --> 25:46.078
and y’all can be the judges.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.180
Oh, so that’s why
we have two turkeys.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.549
Okay, well, how much
is this bet for?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.084
Oh, that’s the best part.

25:52.084 --> 25:55.053
Let’s say, by some miracle
chance, he should win.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.890
All I got to do is cosign
on a loan for that stupid

25:57.890 --> 26:00.692
pipe dream of a bakery--
which will never happen.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.796
But when he loses...
Mm-hmm?

26:03.796 --> 26:06.799
...he can’t come back
here for two years.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.102
What?

26:10.102 --> 26:11.336
Babe.

26:11.336 --> 26:14.106
What? What? Come on, now.
It’s all in fun.

26:14.106 --> 26:18.010
Fun? Do you even
hear yourself, Lou?

26:18.010 --> 26:20.179
Now, you know, y-you and
your brother have been

26:20.179 --> 26:22.748
at each other’s throats
since your folks have got here.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.583
And now you...

26:24.583 --> 26:28.087
you literally want us
to judge this crazy competition?

26:28.087 --> 26:30.088
Babe, a minute ago,
you was cool...

26:30.088 --> 26:32.858
This holiday is about
bringing family together, Lou.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.896
And you think that banning him
from here is you winning?

26:37.896 --> 26:43.435
Well, I, for one, won’t
participate in that.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.272
I don’t want to be
any part of it.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.845
(door opens)

26:52.845 --> 26:54.213
Ta-da!

26:54.213 --> 26:56.215
Hey, if it isn’t
the Pawn Stars.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.850
And, yes, you got
the card!

26:57.850 --> 27:01.487
Feast your eyes
on a 100% genuine

27:01.487 --> 27:05.357
1948 Leaf Stan Musial
baseball card.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.359
Be still, my beating heart.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.827
I know you’re joking.
Nope.

27:08.827 --> 27:11.029
But I got to tell you,
holding this card,

27:11.029 --> 27:13.332
it might be the closest
I ever get to understanding

27:13.332 --> 27:14.433
the mind of a criminal.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.369
Okay. Moving on.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.738
We tracked it down
at a local memorabilia shop.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.307
The owner bought it
earlier today for ten grand.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.842
Ten grand for a card
that’s worth 60?

27:23.842 --> 27:26.979
Th-That thief must have been
pretty strapped for cash

27:26.979 --> 27:28.714
if he was willing to
let it go that cheap.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.148
I don’t suppose we have
a name for the owner?

27:30.148 --> 27:31.817
No, but he did give us
a physical description

27:31.817 --> 27:32.818
of the seller:

27:32.818 --> 27:34.219
uh, Caucasian,

27:34.219 --> 27:35.888
roughly six feet tall,
brown hair.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.723
Didn’t look like
this guy, did he?

27:39.024 --> 27:41.360
TANI: This guy
bought three drills

27:41.360 --> 27:44.363
and a dozen diamond-tipped drill
bits the morning of the robbery.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.899
If I was planning to steal
a priceless baseball card,

27:46.899 --> 27:49.735
I certainly wouldn’t wait till
last minute to buy the tools.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.103
Did you get an I.D.?

27:51.103 --> 27:52.771
Not yet. We tried running
facial recognition,

27:52.771 --> 27:55.073
but the angle and the camera
image quality were no good.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.743
And, of course,
he paid with cash.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.144
TANI:
Here’s the good news.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.546
Henman’s due to land
in a couple minutes.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.581
So Joons and I will
pay him a visit.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.149
I’m sure he wants his card back.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.687
JERRY:
Hey, you...

28:08.687 --> 28:10.522
might want to be
a little more careful with that?

28:10.522 --> 28:13.258
I’ll make sure
she doesn’t sit on it.

28:13.258 --> 28:15.661
WILL:
Wait, that’s Dad?

28:15.661 --> 28:17.496
How old was he, like, 12?

28:17.496 --> 28:20.032
Nah. Eight.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.301
No way!
Yes!

28:22.301 --> 28:23.835
Dad was huge.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.837
(laughter)
Yeah, he was.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.172
Yeah, man.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.174
Boy ate like a dinosaur.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.843
We had to put a lock on the
fridge till he left the house.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.512
(laughter)
He could eat.

28:33.512 --> 28:36.048
Yeah, I can see why Uncle Percy
started calling him Chubster.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.818
No, your uncle didn’t
give him that name.

28:39.818 --> 28:42.287
Some kids at school did.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.789
And you know what?

28:43.789 --> 28:46.959
No matter how much or
how hard they fought,

28:46.959 --> 28:51.463
your father always knew that
he could depend on your uncle

28:51.463 --> 28:53.765
to stick up for him.

28:53.765 --> 28:56.301
No matter what.
PERCY SR.: Yeah.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.803
Once or twice a week,

28:57.803 --> 29:00.072
I’d hear him running down the
street, bullies be chasing him.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.241
I could hear him
saying, "Percy!"

29:02.241 --> 29:04.509
(laughter)
"Percy!"

29:04.509 --> 29:06.478
ELLA: Yes!
Yes!

29:06.478 --> 29:08.480
That’s right.
Wait. Uncle Percy was jacked.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.617
PERCY SR.: Yeah!
ELLA: "Jacked"?

29:11.617 --> 29:12.951
(laughter)
Yeah.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.753
Afro’s a little bit
lopsided, too.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.755
ELLA:
Yes, yes.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.690
It is.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.629
No, no, no, no!

29:26.765 --> 29:28.166
What?

29:32.137 --> 29:34.640
(quietly):
Son of a bitch.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.509
Looking good, baby.
Gobble, gobble.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.677
(laughs)

29:38.677 --> 29:39.945
Hey!

29:39.945 --> 29:41.246
Yeah.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.916
Man, what the hell
is wrong with you?

29:46.018 --> 29:47.285
You want to win this bet so bad,

29:47.285 --> 29:48.987
you come out here
and almost knock over my bird?

29:48.987 --> 29:51.023
Oh, get the hell out of here
with that! You know damn well

29:51.023 --> 29:53.592
you went into the kitchen and
turned the heat up on my bird

29:53.592 --> 29:55.494
while I was upstairs!
I didn’t have nothing
to do with that!

29:55.494 --> 29:57.496
You think I don’t know
a lie when I hear one?!

29:57.496 --> 30:00.098
Boy, don’t you know who I am?!
I’m the police!

30:00.098 --> 30:03.201
You’ve been two steps away
from jail since you could crawl.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.203
And here I was just
starting to feel sorry

30:05.203 --> 30:06.538
for your deadbeat ass.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.141
What’d you just say to me?

30:09.141 --> 30:11.610
You ain’t deaf, L’il Percy.
You heard me.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.779
You so damn pompous.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.214
You know what?
To hell with you and this bet.

30:16.214 --> 30:17.382
Fine.

30:17.382 --> 30:20.018
You and me? We’re done.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.987
Yeah, we done.
We done after I whip your ass.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.989
Yeah? You can try.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.590
Huh? Huh?

30:30.962 --> 30:32.230
(both grunting)

30:35.400 --> 30:37.969
PERCY SR.:
Enough!

30:42.507 --> 30:45.043
I didn’t raise
you boys like that.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.978
(panting)

30:52.651 --> 30:54.286
Babe.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.023
That’s okay, baby.
Come on.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.177
Fire.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.178
Fire!

31:21.413 --> 31:23.615
Fire! Somebody call
the fire department!

31:27.953 --> 31:29.354
Well, thanks
for getting this back.

31:29.354 --> 31:30.756
You got any leads
on who stole it?

31:30.756 --> 31:32.023
Actually, Mr. Henman,
that’s why we’re here.

31:32.023 --> 31:33.091
Uh, we do have a suspect.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.659
I know the image
isn’t great, but...

31:35.994 --> 31:37.229
...do you recognize that guy?

31:38.530 --> 31:41.633
It’s hard to tell. Should I?

31:41.633 --> 31:43.468
Well, considering nothing else
was stolen from your safe,

31:43.468 --> 31:45.103
we believe that it was
a targeted robbery,

31:45.103 --> 31:46.705
which means
whoever broke in

31:46.705 --> 31:48.039
knew that the card was here.

31:48.039 --> 31:49.574
Hold on.

31:52.177 --> 31:55.046
Yeah. (chuckles)

31:55.046 --> 31:57.048
That’s him.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.250
His name’s Patrick
something or other.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.418
He works at a homeless
shelter I donated to.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.222
He and I talked baseball a few
times. He knew about the card.

32:04.222 --> 32:07.025
Can you get us that address?

32:07.025 --> 32:08.260
I don’t suppose you’ll let me

32:08.260 --> 32:09.761
finish my shift
before you book me?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.397
Patrick, where’s the money
you got for the baseball card?

32:12.397 --> 32:13.765
You’re looking at it.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.468
It’s on her plate here.
His plate there.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.573
TANI: You broke
into Henman’s place

32:21.573 --> 32:24.042
and drilled into his
safe so you could...

32:24.042 --> 32:25.777
you could feed the
homeless on Thanksgiving?

32:25.777 --> 32:28.713
Yeah, I did.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.816
Four years ago,

32:30.816 --> 32:32.884
I met Mr. Henman
at a U of H game,

32:32.884 --> 32:35.086
and he believed in
what we were doing here,

32:35.086 --> 32:36.721
so much so, he pledged
to start underwriting

32:36.721 --> 32:37.889
our Thanksgiving dinner.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.958
That’s very generous.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.562
Extremely. He could afford it,
of course.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.698
And he’d show up every year
in his-his fancy car,

32:46.698 --> 32:48.033
wearing his fancy watch,

32:48.033 --> 32:50.402
spend ten minutes with us
and pose for a photo

32:50.402 --> 32:52.304
so he’d get his name
in the papers.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.905
And I was okay with that

32:53.905 --> 32:55.707
because everyone
was getting fed,

32:55.707 --> 32:57.509
but this year,
when I called him

32:57.509 --> 32:59.311
for his donation,
he told me his accountant

32:59.311 --> 33:01.513
found a better tax dodge.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.748
When I told him
that meant

33:03.748 --> 33:06.785
hundreds of people would
go hungry on Thanksgiving,

33:06.785 --> 33:10.388
he said that was my
problem, not his.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.392
Guess he was right.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.695
All right, look,

33:16.695 --> 33:18.964
you may have stolen the card
for the right reasons,

33:18.964 --> 33:20.866
but you still broke the law,

33:20.866 --> 33:24.236
and were gonna
have to arrest you.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.343
Right after you finish serving
these people their food.

33:33.078 --> 33:35.614
And you know what,
while we’re here,

33:35.614 --> 33:37.215
it looks like you
could use some help.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.150
♪ ♪

34:04.609 --> 34:06.544
♪ ♪

34:11.283 --> 34:15.620
We were actually able to contain
the fire to the kitchen.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.657
But seems like someone left
a greasy towel on the stovetop.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.993
Huh. Well, that’s weird.

34:21.993 --> 34:23.662
Y’all have a lot
to be thankful for.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.063
This could’ve been way worse.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.698
Yeah.
Thank you.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.466
So much.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.068
(exhales)

34:30.068 --> 34:31.569
Oh, my God.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.605
Hey, you want to hear
something funny?

34:33.605 --> 34:36.541
Please. I could use
a good laugh.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.376
Well, it’s kind of
my fault.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.878
Why?

34:39.878 --> 34:43.048
I-I had a few
cocktails too many.

34:43.048 --> 34:46.117
I thought that the turkey
wasn’t cooking fast enough,

34:46.117 --> 34:48.820
so I turned it
all the way up.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.188
Without your glasses on.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.424
Yeah.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.326
I thought you said
it was gonna be funny.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.967
If I catch you without
your glasses on again,

35:01.967 --> 35:04.502
I’m gonna tape them
to your head.

35:04.502 --> 35:05.837
Yes.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.009
You think it’s over?

35:11.009 --> 35:12.677
You better go talk
to your wife.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.479
Way ahead of you, boy.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.614
Way ahead of you.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.687
Well, I mean, you know,
all’s well that ends well.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.256
At least you gonna get that
new kitchen you’ve been wanting.

35:25.256 --> 35:26.424
It’s gonna be...

35:26.424 --> 35:27.826
nice, babe.

35:27.826 --> 35:31.629
Sweetheart, I’m so sorry.

35:31.629 --> 35:33.431
Don’t be mad.
Baby, I’m so sorry.

35:33.431 --> 35:34.799
I know I disappointed you...

35:34.799 --> 35:37.202
Shh, shh.

35:37.202 --> 35:40.238
I’m not the one
you should be apologizing to.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.078
Go on.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.180
Oh, my...

35:52.517 --> 35:55.887
I don’t know what
you looking at.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.822
(chuckles)

36:00.125 --> 36:01.960
Percy,

36:01.960 --> 36:04.562
I want to apologize

36:04.562 --> 36:07.198
for the way
I’ve been treating you.

36:07.198 --> 36:09.434
I want to apologize
to you because of

36:09.434 --> 36:11.870
the horrible things I said
to you, man; I didn’t mean it.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.606
You’re my big brother,

36:14.606 --> 36:17.342
and I love you.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.544
I just want you
to know I’m sorry.

36:19.544 --> 36:22.380
Well, guess what.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.382
I’m sorry.

36:24.382 --> 36:27.819
See, I’m not gonna let you
hog all the blame.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.188
And, uh...

36:33.024 --> 36:34.793
You know, I’ve been, uh...

36:34.793 --> 36:40.331
I’ve been keeping a scrapbook
of all your achievements.

36:40.331 --> 36:42.467
Yeah.

36:42.467 --> 36:45.370
Box scores...

36:45.370 --> 36:49.441
from when you won
the state semis.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.210
You had 12 tackles.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.212
(chuckles)

36:54.212 --> 36:58.550
I wanted to tell you that,
little brother.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.386
I just couldn’t get it out, man.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.958
(chuckles)
The picture of you and me

37:06.958 --> 37:09.561
at your graduation
from the academy.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.197
And that
Tribune article

37:12.197 --> 37:15.734
about that big sting operation
you were a part of.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.440
I’ve been a jackass
all these years.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.275
And the fact is

37:24.275 --> 37:26.377
you are

37:26.377 --> 37:30.715
more accomplished,
more-more responsible,

37:30.715 --> 37:34.219
more disciplined.

37:34.219 --> 37:36.955
And more in debt to you
than you’ll ever know.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.424
You made a man
out of me, Percy.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.292
Don’t you know that?

37:41.292 --> 37:44.062
I’m the man I am today
because of you.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.464
You’re the reason
I became a cop.

37:46.464 --> 37:50.535
Because I wanted
to protect people

37:50.535 --> 37:52.370
who couldn’t
protect themselves,

37:52.370 --> 37:56.174
the same way that
you would protect me.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.509
I’m sorry.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.211
I’m so sorry, man.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.946
I’m sorry. (kisses)

38:01.946 --> 38:03.314
Thank you, brother.

38:03.314 --> 38:05.817
You’re my big brother
and I love you. You hear me?

38:05.817 --> 38:06.985
PERCY SR.:
Uh, I ain’t saying

38:06.985 --> 38:08.520
that ain’t nice
or something like that,

38:08.520 --> 38:10.455
but, uh, when we gonna eat?

38:10.455 --> 38:11.856
(laughter)

38:11.856 --> 38:14.125
Damn, Pop.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.061
All right,
well, relax.

38:17.061 --> 38:19.697
It’s a good thing we got another
turkey. See? Came in handy.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.000
Yeah, uh, about that turkey.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.336
When we was having that
little squabble out back...
Yeah?

38:25.336 --> 38:26.838
...it knocked
the cord out.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.207
That turkey’s soaking
in about ten gallons

38:29.207 --> 38:32.377
of olive oil; that turkey
ain’t gonna be no good, bruh.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.612
GROVER: Hang on a second.
Everybody relax. Relax.

38:34.612 --> 38:37.248
Take your hands off your hip,
babe. Don’t be mad no more.

38:37.248 --> 38:41.386
Look, we are going to have
Thanksgiving dinner.

38:41.386 --> 38:44.322
(stammers) It may not be as
we envisioned it, but, uh,

38:44.322 --> 38:47.826
I got an idea.
Just hang on.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.993
Hey.
(phone speed dials)

38:48.993 --> 38:51.496
Yeah?
You was crying, huh?

38:51.496 --> 38:53.231
You don’t never stop,
do you?
(laughs)

38:59.971 --> 39:01.439
GROVER:
Come on, babe.

39:01.439 --> 39:02.807
Grovers have arrived.

39:02.807 --> 39:05.076
Hey.
Hey!

39:05.076 --> 39:06.244
Everybody, happy Thanksgiving.
(others greeting)

39:06.244 --> 39:07.579
Um, hey, man,

39:07.579 --> 39:09.280
thanks for letting us
crash your dinner, big fella.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.815
We appreciate it.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.517
O.G., there’s always
a space at my table

39:12.517 --> 39:13.785
for the Grover family,
you know that.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.987
Thank you, sir.
Tell me,

39:15.987 --> 39:19.224
how’d you manage
to ruin two turkeys?

39:19.224 --> 39:21.793
Oh, it was easy.
He burned the house down.
What?

39:21.793 --> 39:23.461
You have one kitchen fire...
Oh, it was so close...

39:23.461 --> 39:24.562
GROVER:
I’m the police.

39:24.562 --> 39:25.830
You can’t tell people
I burned...

39:25.830 --> 39:27.565
RENEE:
Oh, don’t get me started...

39:27.565 --> 39:29.667
Joons, I’d like to give you
a warning.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.270
My pants have
an elastic waistband.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.538
I’ve skipped lunch today

39:33.538 --> 39:35.039
to maximize
stomach capacity.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.042
My goal is to keep pace
with you tonight.

39:38.042 --> 39:41.112
Oh, actually, I’m gonna
have to duck out early tonight.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.514
I promised my mom I’d stop by
their family dinner.

39:43.514 --> 39:45.617
Wow, okay.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.418
Yeah.
That’s great.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.153
Isn’t it? That’s great.

39:49.153 --> 39:51.789
Yeah, i-it’s a start.
I guess, at some point,

39:51.789 --> 39:54.692
me and my dad have to learn how
to be in the same room together.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.227
Yeah. Okay, all right.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.895
Well, here’s to, um,

39:57.895 --> 39:59.330
dysfunctional families

39:59.330 --> 40:02.200
and-and the holidays that force
us to spend time with them.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.269
(laughs) Cheers.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.204
Cheers.
Cheers.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.216
How you holding up?

40:18.216 --> 40:20.551
First Thanksgiving
without Kono.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.553
It’s got to be hard.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.822
(sighs)

40:24.822 --> 40:27.525
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.127
I won’t lie.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.564
But I’m thankful
for what I have.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.602
(lively chatter)

40:44.876 --> 40:47.979
Okay.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.213
All right.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.982
This is it.
Yep.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.685
Danny already signed. Soon as
you add your John Hancock,

40:53.685 --> 40:55.820
Steve’s will be the sole
proprietorship of yours truly.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.522
All righty.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.361
(sighs) You know
what’s crazy to me?

41:03.361 --> 41:07.699
Is that after all of that,
we almost broke even.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.134
In this business,

41:10.134 --> 41:12.036
you call that success.
(sighs)

41:12.036 --> 41:13.671
GROVER:
What’s up, fellas?

41:13.671 --> 41:14.872
What’s up? I’ll tell
you what’s up.

41:14.872 --> 41:17.575
Danny and I have now officially

41:17.575 --> 41:20.378
signed this restaurant in its
entirety over to Kamekona, so...

41:20.378 --> 41:22.513
Stop playing. Look, I need to
talk to you about something...

41:22.513 --> 41:23.681
I ain’t playing.
I ain’t playing.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.717
And you don’t talk
to me anymore.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.418
You now talk

41:27.418 --> 41:29.287
to this man.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.823
Good night.
Okay.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.792
Well, all right, I guess you’re
the man. I need to talk to you.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.427
So, uh...

41:37.995 --> 41:39.864
Yo, Kamekona, this is
my big brother, Percy.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.032
How you doing, brother?

41:41.032 --> 41:42.533
All right.

41:42.533 --> 41:44.535
He is an expert baker.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.604
I’m telling you, man,
he is so good

41:46.604 --> 41:47.939
that when my wife--

41:47.939 --> 41:49.374
You know what? Never mind.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.942
I’m not even gonna hype it.
Here.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.878
Here.

41:53.878 --> 41:56.080
Is that a kouign-amann?

41:56.080 --> 41:57.215
How the hell is it

41:57.215 --> 41:58.483
that everybody knows
what that is but me?

41:58.483 --> 41:59.784
(laughs)

41:59.784 --> 42:02.086
Go ahead and roll
that around

42:02.086 --> 42:03.855
in your mouth.

42:05.490 --> 42:06.824
Well?

42:08.559 --> 42:10.128
You’re hired.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.829
Congratulations.
What?

42:11.829 --> 42:13.264
Wow.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.233
Thank you,
my brother.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.068
All right.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.507
You did it. (chuckles)

42:24.909 --> 42:29.180
Look, there ain’t
gonna be any more crying.

42:31.282 --> 42:32.817
Yeah.

42:34.652 --> 42:35.653
Come here, little brother.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.325
I love you, man.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.994
(chuckles)
Come on, let’s go eat.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.964
(laughter, lively chatter)

42:46.964 --> 42:49.534
STEVE:
Come on.

42:49.534 --> 42:52.203
Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone. Let’s cheers.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.539
OTHERS: Cheers!
