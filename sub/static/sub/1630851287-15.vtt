<i> Okay, everybody,</i>

00:35.611 --> 00:37.127
let's get going
to Maude's All Day.

00:37.129 --> 00:38.445
It's group soup night
and I'm worried

00:38.539 --> 00:40.205
they might run out
of cauliflower bisque.

00:40.432 --> 00:42.190
That would ruin my plans to say

00:42.209 --> 00:44.601
"bisque me on the lips"
as I take my first bite.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.378
I'm more worried they'll
run out of those big spoons.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.380
I love clinking spoons
with you guys

00:48.532 --> 00:50.049
in the middle
of the community pot.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.367
Well, have fun, guys.
Remember, Honeybee and I

00:52.461 --> 00:54.795
are staying home
for our double shark dinner.

00:54.947 --> 00:58.282
Shark dinner? It's about time
we start eating them back.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.391
Actually, we're watching
Shark Week

00:59.618 --> 01:01.451
and I'm waiting on a call
from<i> Shark Tank.</i>

01:01.512 --> 01:03.044
Wolf and I sent them
a bunch of business ideas

01:03.064 --> 01:05.122
along with the house number
to ensure there would be

01:05.140 --> 01:07.766
no risk of bad cell connection
when Barbara says,

01:07.993 --> 01:09.142
"Your valuation is insane."

01:09.236 --> 01:10.627
Oh, my God, chills.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.404
And plus, group soup
is a no for me.

01:12.556 --> 01:14.239
I don't like food
you can't see the bottom of.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.133
Could be anything down there.
A bunch of nickels,

01:16.226 --> 01:19.303
a syringe, a wet wig. Mm-mmm.
You guys are too trusting.

01:19.396 --> 01:21.896
Tonight's Shark Week event is
a show about two shark brothers

01:22.065 --> 01:25.567
who eat an eel from both ends
like it's a Fruit by the Foot.

01:25.661 --> 01:27.811
Ugh. I checked the mailbox,
and still no report cards.

01:27.904 --> 01:29.254
They were supposed
to come this week.

01:29.406 --> 01:31.757
I can't wait anymore, so
here's my reaction now, ready?

01:31.984 --> 01:35.001
(shrieks) All A's?
And coolest student?

01:35.154 --> 01:36.744
What the... Wha... Wow!
I mean,

01:36.839 --> 01:38.655
why would they even put that
on a report card, you know?

01:38.748 --> 01:40.081
In fact, they usually don't.
They had to print this one

01:40.101 --> 01:41.749
specially for me.
They had to send it out

01:41.769 --> 01:43.435
to a printing place and they got
it back and they were like,

01:43.587 --> 01:44.752
"Okay, now we'll send it
to Judy. (giggles)

01:44.847 --> 01:46.346
It's about her. She won."
(short giggle)

01:46.440 --> 01:49.424
Maybe they're not sending report
cards this year, to save paper.

01:49.518 --> 01:50.442
That might be right.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.002
Yesterday,
in the school bathroom,

01:52.020 --> 01:53.445
the toilet paper had no paper

01:53.597 --> 01:55.339
and just one
big wad of gum in it.

01:55.507 --> 01:58.600
It got the job done,
but I didn't love it.

01:58.677 --> 02:01.194
Guys, if we don't leave
for group soup right now

02:01.288 --> 02:02.437
I am father-divorcing you.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.456
Dad, no!
Everybody, let's go, go, go!

02:04.608 --> 02:08.018
Bye and have fun,
my Wolf Wife of Wall Street.

02:08.111 --> 02:10.036
Bye.
Have fun eating your gross soup.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.039
Aw, hello, shark.
Ooh, goodbye, leg.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.041
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Good Charlotte, this bisque</i>

02:15.177 --> 02:16.376
does not missque.

02:16.528 --> 02:18.362
Anybody mind if I take
my little bread boat

02:18.455 --> 02:20.139
for a sail
on these creamy waters?

02:20.290 --> 02:21.640
-Ahoy, son.
-You guys let me know

02:21.791 --> 02:24.459
when you need a re-bisque.
Hey, isn't that your car?

02:24.628 --> 02:26.553
HAM:
Oh. That moose
is cleaning our car

02:26.705 --> 02:28.963
-for us.
-Actually, Ham, moose do that

02:28.983 --> 02:30.540
because they like
the road salt

02:30.634 --> 02:32.651
that kicks up onto the car
when you drive.

02:32.878 --> 02:34.469
Wow, he is really
going to town.

02:34.563 --> 02:36.137
Feels a little
intimate, actually.

02:36.231 --> 02:37.656
I'm just gonna
look over here. Oh, no,

02:37.807 --> 02:40.217
the way Santiago is eating
his group soup all alone

02:40.386 --> 02:42.402
also looks too intimate.
Where can I look?

02:42.554 --> 02:44.830
Should we go shoo him off, Dad?
There are signs up all over

02:44.981 --> 02:46.239
saying not to let moose do that.

02:46.392 --> 02:49.317
Moose are very dangerous,
but we're safely inside.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.045
Let's just let him enjoy himself
for a brief moment.

02:52.155 --> 02:55.399
Great. We'll eat our group soup
and he'll eat our car.

02:55.492 --> 02:57.176
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Thanks for staying</i>
<i> back with me, Moon.</i>

02:57.252 --> 02:58.343
Don't tell the family this,

02:58.495 --> 03:00.012
but I'm the only Tobin
who doesn't

03:00.163 --> 03:02.906
enjoy group soup. Ugh,
I'm with you on the wet wig.

03:02.999 --> 03:04.674
-(phone rings)
-Ooh! Could be<i> Shark Tank.</i>

03:05.427 --> 03:07.686
Honeybee Shaw, She-E-O speaking.

03:07.837 --> 03:10.522
Oh, uh, Dwayne Gibbons,
Lone Moose School principal.

03:10.674 --> 03:13.083
Is Beef home?
I'm calling to talk about

03:13.101 --> 03:14.676
the report cards
we mailed over.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.254
He's not home and the report
cards haven't arrived yet.

03:17.272 --> 03:18.939
Huh. I sent them last week
with plenty

03:19.033 --> 03:20.774
of<i> Frasier</i> -themed postage--

03:20.850 --> 03:22.259
two Niles and a Daphne.

03:22.352 --> 03:24.444
-I can pass on a message.
<i> -Sure. I'd like to discuss</i>

03:24.596 --> 03:27.206
<i> -Moon's failing grade in math.</i>
-Oh, no.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.374
<i> His teacher, Mrs. Hill,</i>
<i> agreed to let him take</i>

03:29.526 --> 03:30.450
<i> a make-up test on Monday.</i>

03:30.544 --> 03:31.710
But I'm afraid
if he doesn't pass,

03:31.937 --> 03:33.361
we'll have to hold him back.

03:33.439 --> 03:34.862
Hmm.
I'll let Beef know.

03:34.957 --> 03:36.773
Was it the sharks?
Is Mr. Wonderful

03:36.792 --> 03:38.383
as great as his name implies?

03:38.610 --> 03:40.794
Moon, we got to talk
about the report cards.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.946
-Disagree.
-I heard about the math grade

03:42.965 --> 03:44.948
and the make-up test
on Monday, too.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.225
Ugh! Okay, fine.

03:46.452 --> 03:48.134
I'm just embarrassed
because everybody else

03:48.229 --> 03:49.803
in my family is great at math.

03:49.955 --> 03:53.565
I hear you. I'm a big ideas
person, not a numbers person.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.126
I pretended I got my tonsils out
six times in a row

03:56.219 --> 03:58.295
in high school so I didn't
have to take the algebra unit.

03:58.388 --> 03:59.963
I told my teacher
they kept growing back.

03:59.982 --> 04:01.798
-So smart.
-Then I did the same thing

04:01.891 --> 04:04.225
-with appendixes in pre-calc.
-Another solid idea.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.894
-I should write these down.
-But I eventually did

04:06.914 --> 04:08.972
have to pass it
to get my associate's degree.

04:09.141 --> 04:11.308
Maybe I could help you
pass that make-up test.

04:11.326 --> 04:12.809
I don't think that's possible.

04:12.902 --> 04:15.829
How about this: I'll wait to
tell your dad if you let me try.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.239
Fine. Now can we please
get back to watching

04:18.317 --> 04:19.758
<i> America's Funniest</i>
<i> Shark Attacks?</i>

04:19.909 --> 04:22.427
The attacks aren't necessarily
laugh-out-loud hilarious,

04:22.579 --> 04:25.079
but the sound effects
help a lot.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.340
All right, let's carefully
get in the car

04:27.493 --> 04:29.417
on the moose-free side.
He'll be scared off

04:29.436 --> 04:30.918
once I start the engine.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.605
I am normally very against
interrupting a make-out sesh,

04:33.757 --> 04:35.423
but in this case I'll allow it.

04:35.592 --> 04:38.259
Huh. Maybe once we start moving,
he'll take the hint.

04:38.353 --> 04:39.686
(bellows)

04:39.780 --> 04:41.855
Oh, no! We created a Romeo
and Juliet kind of thing.

04:42.024 --> 04:44.599
He only wants the van more now
that he knows it's forbidden.

04:44.693 --> 04:46.843
I'll drive slow,
so as to not to hurt him,

04:46.862 --> 04:48.678
but hopefully he loses interest.

04:48.697 --> 04:50.347
Aw. Is it just me,

04:50.365 --> 04:54.626
or is this very,
very, very romantic?

04:56.463 --> 04:59.113
Okay, quickly, everyone,
go, go, go, go.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.707
HONEYBEE:
What's with the moose
on your caboose?

05:00.859 --> 05:02.968
He walked alongside our car
all the way home.

05:03.119 --> 05:04.544
'Cause he's in love
with our van.

05:04.696 --> 05:06.863
They make a pretty cute couple.
And just imagine

05:06.882 --> 05:10.367
those eventual babies.
Aw, vroom, vroom.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.126
He's just enjoying
the road salt.

05:12.220 --> 05:13.887
I'm sure he'll be gone
by morning.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.630
-Do we call animal control?
-I wish.

05:15.724 --> 05:16.982
The animal control number

05:17.133 --> 05:19.543
goes straight to a pre-recorded
message that says,

05:19.561 --> 05:20.727
"You can handle this."

05:20.804 --> 05:21.987
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Good morning,</i>

05:22.138 --> 05:23.380
my Honey-queen.

05:23.398 --> 05:24.564
What's with the school setup?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.807
Oh, is this a sex thing?

05:25.901 --> 05:27.326
Are-are you my teacher?

05:27.477 --> 05:28.643
I need help, you know, studying

05:28.662 --> 05:30.329
for my, uh, uh, sex exam?

05:30.480 --> 05:33.832
No. Stop. It's not a sex thing.
It's for your little brother.

05:33.983 --> 05:36.150
I'm tutoring him. He's failing
math, but they're letting him

05:36.244 --> 05:38.319
take a make-up test, and
I think I could actually help.

05:38.413 --> 05:40.188
I love that you're helping
my littlest bro.

05:40.248 --> 05:42.156
He's my littlest bro now, too.
Oh, but please

05:42.176 --> 05:43.825
don't tell the rest of your
family he's having trouble.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.677
Secret's safe with me, and
let me know if you guys want

05:45.829 --> 05:49.906
my help. I'm a real Math-thew
Mc-Counting-hey myself.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.833
-You are?
-Oh, yeah. Listen to this one.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.835
-One, two.
-Go on.

05:53.929 --> 05:56.688
-Three, four.
-Hell yeah, babe.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.599
The moose is still here?
Okay, so we know one thing:

05:59.751 --> 06:01.026
he's a gentleman.

06:01.253 --> 06:03.770
-Hmm. Yep, this is a problem.
<i> -HONEYBEE: Moon.</i>

06:03.922 --> 06:05.864
Welcome to class.
I'm Ms. Lefontaine.

06:06.015 --> 06:07.866
It's just me, Honeybee,
but I've always wanted my name

06:08.035 --> 06:10.594
to be Annabelle Lefontaine.
It's gorgeous.

06:10.612 --> 06:13.613
Well, Ms. Lefontaine, I'm sorry,
but there is no point

06:13.707 --> 06:16.116
in you tutoring me.
There's a specific reason

06:16.268 --> 06:18.543
why I'm very bad at math.
It's genetic.

06:18.695 --> 06:20.286
And it can't be fixed.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.788
But your family is good at math.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.215
Right.
But I'm not like them,

06:23.366 --> 06:26.718
and I don't want them
to find out why. The truth is,

06:26.870 --> 06:29.036
the man I call Dad--
Beef Tobin--

06:29.056 --> 06:30.680
isn't my real father.

06:33.635 --> 06:36.453
Okay, back up. Why do you think
Beef isn't your dad?

06:36.546 --> 06:37.729
I always thought
I was so similar

06:37.956 --> 06:39.973
to the rest of my family,
but once this math thing

06:40.125 --> 06:41.900
came up last week,
I started to pick up on

06:42.127 --> 06:44.144
all the other things
that are different about me.

06:44.296 --> 06:47.147
My hair is dark, I'm short,
I also roll out my toothpaste

06:47.299 --> 06:49.390
from the bottom to the top,
they all just

06:49.410 --> 06:51.893
squeeze it out willy-nilly,
like total monsters.

06:51.987 --> 06:53.970
Ugh, they really do.
But, Moon,

06:54.063 --> 06:55.563
I don't think
that proves anything.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.566
Look, it's as clear as day.
Dad's not my dad.

06:58.660 --> 07:01.478
I've narrowed it down to
three men I think it could be,

07:01.496 --> 07:03.980
and I'm putting together a plan
to investigate them.

07:03.999 --> 07:06.149
Moon, I'm very sure
you're a true Tobin.

07:06.151 --> 07:09.002
But I have always wanted
to do a<i> Mamma Mia!</i>

07:09.154 --> 07:10.429
How 'bout this:
I help you check out

07:10.580 --> 07:12.246
these potential papas,
and you let me tutor you

07:12.266 --> 07:14.266
-for your make-up test
while we're doing it.
-Deal.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.935
Also, I don't think you should
tell your dad about this.

07:17.128 --> 07:19.921
Of course not.
The truth would crush him.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.331
I'm his favorite.

07:21.424 --> 07:22.999
I'm not sure how we do it,

07:23.092 --> 07:24.759
but we've got to get rid
of that moose.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.503
For his safety and ours.

07:26.596 --> 07:29.005
Okay, hear me out.
How about I get a moose costume

07:29.098 --> 07:31.691
and also a moose-sized
French maid outfit?

07:31.860 --> 07:34.360
I put them both on,
and I'll be a sexy lady moose.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.270
He'll be so distracted
by my sultry strut,

07:36.290 --> 07:38.515
the moose will leave the van
alone to come flirt with me.

07:38.608 --> 07:42.352
Or what if we show him another
car to distract him instead?

07:42.445 --> 07:43.687
That's worth a try, Judy.

07:43.705 --> 07:46.022
Oh, and put the car
in the French maid outfit.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.448
I love it.

07:47.693 --> 07:51.136
Okay. So you think this random
truck driver is your real dad?

07:51.363 --> 07:52.620
-I don't see it.
-I've seen him

07:52.714 --> 07:54.622
driving around town,
and there's something

07:54.716 --> 07:57.717
un-bear-ably similar
about both of us.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.869
HONEYBEE:
You mean how his flappy hat
kind of looks

07:59.963 --> 08:01.554
-like your bear suit?
-Bingo.

08:01.707 --> 08:03.148
HONEYBEE: Moon, look.
He has Florida plates.

08:03.299 --> 08:04.708
I have Florida heritage?

08:04.726 --> 08:08.211
That explains why I love
sunshine. Uh-oh, he's leaving.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.638
Sir! Hi there.
I see you're from Florida.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.140
Yeah, I've been doing
this Florida-Alaska drive

08:13.193 --> 08:15.568
twice a week for just under
seven years, ma'am.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.905
-Twice a week?
-Yep. I've only
been in 63 accidents.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.314
I tend to fall asleep
at the wheel

08:20.408 --> 08:22.316
'cause I keep
the heat in here on max.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.077
You are very sweaty, my friend.

08:24.229 --> 08:26.079
Well, I'm also
chock-full of amphetamines.

08:26.231 --> 08:27.897
I don't even know
if you two are real.

08:27.991 --> 08:30.233
Anyway, I got a thousand miles
to drive tonight.

08:30.252 --> 08:32.068
See ya, possible ghosts.

08:32.161 --> 08:34.513
See? He's only driven here
for seven years.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.348
You were born in
Alaska ten years ago.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.424
There's no way
he's secretly your dad.

08:38.577 --> 08:40.260
-I know.
-Also, he said he has to drive

08:40.412 --> 08:42.579
a thousand miles today.
Let's say he only has

08:42.597 --> 08:44.856
ten hours to drive.
What speed should he go

08:45.083 --> 08:46.583
in order to make it
to his next stop?

08:46.601 --> 08:49.343
I don't know.
Nine million miles per hour?

08:49.363 --> 08:50.754
I told you I'm bad at math.

08:50.922 --> 08:53.532
Or you just need an in--
your way of connecting to math

08:53.759 --> 08:55.775
that helps you understand it.
For me, it was when

08:55.927 --> 08:57.944
I needed to figure out how long
it would take me to watch

08:58.096 --> 09:00.129
every episode
of<i> Hangin' with Mr. Cooper</i>

09:00.131 --> 09:01.373
so I'd be caught up
before the movie came out.

09:01.524 --> 09:03.449
I'm all caught up,
but I'm still waiting.

09:03.618 --> 09:05.602
We just got to figure out
that in for you.

09:05.620 --> 09:08.863
No, we need to find my dad.
On to the next.

09:08.957 --> 09:11.383
<i> MAN:</i>
<i>Be sure to check back in with us</i>
<i> tonight so you know the weather</i>

09:11.534 --> 09:14.294
<i> for tomorrow when your head</i>
<i> hits that "pellow."</i>

09:14.462 --> 09:15.612
This weatherman, really?

09:15.630 --> 09:18.706
Yep. Harry Hotfog,
Diondra Tundra's rival.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.559
Why would this guy be your dad?

09:20.786 --> 09:22.209
Everyone in my family
says "pillow,"

09:22.229 --> 09:25.972
but I say "pellow," like Harry.
Pretty freaky, huh?

09:26.124 --> 09:28.291
Mm, sounds like a fairly
reasonable coincidence.

09:28.384 --> 09:30.735
-Ooh! There he is.
-Yoo-hoo!

09:30.962 --> 09:32.345
-Harry!
-Uh-oh.

09:32.422 --> 09:34.130
cloudy with a chance
of superfans.

09:34.149 --> 09:35.815
You want autographs?
Five bucks.

09:35.967 --> 09:38.484
Two bucks extra if you want me
to draw a little storm cloud.

09:38.637 --> 09:40.987
Sir, how long
have you lived in Lone Moose?

09:41.139 --> 09:43.915
My whole life.
23 glorious years.

09:44.142 --> 09:46.251
-You're only 23?
-Yes. I dye my hair gray

09:46.402 --> 09:48.253
so people will
take me seriously.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.571
Normally I'm a beautiful blonde.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.257
He's way too young.
This can't be the guy.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.167
-Bye, Harry.
-Good talking to you.

09:54.319 --> 09:55.760
Hotfog rolling out.

09:55.912 --> 09:58.004
(sighs)
Well, there's only one guy left

09:58.156 --> 10:01.116
on my possible paternity list.
And since the other two

10:01.118 --> 10:04.510
random people weren't my dad,
it's definitely him.

10:04.663 --> 10:05.678
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Pete,</i>

10:05.755 --> 10:06.921
the Val-U-Buy cashier?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.757
You gave me $40.
Your groceries were $31,

10:09.776 --> 10:12.426
so I give you, two, uh...

10:12.446 --> 10:14.261
$22 back.

10:14.356 --> 10:15.447
That's correct.

10:15.598 --> 10:17.523
-Oh, I see.
-He's notoriously bad at math.

10:17.676 --> 10:20.360
Mom used to only
get in his line. In six months,

10:20.512 --> 10:22.120
she got enough money
from him to buy

10:22.271 --> 10:23.696
-the new refrigerator we needed.
-Wow.

10:23.849 --> 10:25.123
I mean, she used the money

10:25.350 --> 10:28.034
to get her Camaro windows
tinted, but you see my point.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.629
All right, let's
buy these and meet Pete.

10:30.856 --> 10:32.780
-Hello, Pete.
-Good afternoon. How are you?

10:32.858 --> 10:35.859
Well, I'm annoyed at these
headlines about Jennifer Aniston

10:35.877 --> 10:37.302
wondering if she's
pregnant again.

10:37.453 --> 10:39.195
Leave that sexy,
single freebird alone.

10:39.364 --> 10:40.864
-You know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm.

10:40.957 --> 10:42.699
-Any kids yourself, Pete?
-Me?

10:42.717 --> 10:45.034
Ha, not that I know of. (laughs)

10:45.128 --> 10:47.553
No, but really, I am a virgin.
There's no way.

10:47.706 --> 10:51.040
-And here's your change: $111.
-Pete, no!

10:51.059 --> 10:53.209
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> You sure you don't</i>
<i> want some ice cream?</i>

10:53.228 --> 10:55.153
Yeah, most adults don't
have a huge ice cream sundae

10:55.304 --> 10:57.397
-as an afternoon snack.
-Suit yourself.

10:57.549 --> 10:59.883
Well, now that we know
Beef is your real pop,

10:59.976 --> 11:01.217
we can get home
and get studying.

11:01.219 --> 11:02.661
Hey, is this seat taken, son?

11:02.888 --> 11:05.722
-Nope. All yours, Mr. Mailman.
-What'll it be, Reggie?

11:05.740 --> 11:09.167
I'll have the Big Boy Ice Cream
Sundae with Sauce. You know me--

11:09.394 --> 11:11.819
I love a huge ice cream sundae
in the afternoon.

11:11.913 --> 11:13.838
Are you seeing this?
Called me son.

11:13.915 --> 11:15.840
Eating a huge ice cream
in the afternoon.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.734
Short stature.
Dark hair.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.493
It's him. He's it.

11:19.587 --> 11:21.179
This is who we've
been looking for.

11:21.406 --> 11:25.183
My real father is the mailman.

11:28.246 --> 11:30.580
Okay, so you're saying you want
to be a mailman one day?

11:30.673 --> 11:32.598
Oh, yeah.
I think it's in my blood.

11:32.751 --> 11:33.766
Couple of questions for you.

11:33.935 --> 11:35.176
How long have you
lived in Lone Moose?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.361
Ever been in a relationship?
Also,

11:36.512 --> 11:39.756
how do you say this word:
P-I-L-L-O-W?

11:39.849 --> 11:41.274
Lived here 30 years.
Yes, I've had

11:41.368 --> 11:43.368
my fair share of relationships.

11:43.519 --> 11:45.036
A few I thought
would go the distance,

11:45.113 --> 11:47.521
but I guess they didn't
have enough postage.

11:47.690 --> 11:48.873
And, to answer your
last question, "pellow."

11:49.025 --> 11:50.433
Are you saying pillow
or "pellow"?

11:50.526 --> 11:51.284
-Pillow.
-What?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.785
-"Pellow."
-One more time.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.620
Thanks for bringing
your cars, Kyle.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.790
No problem. They deserve some
attention now and again.

11:57.943 --> 11:59.459
Let's seduce a moose.

11:59.611 --> 12:03.054
Let's see if he wants to get
hot and heavy with a Chevy.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.632
Or take it nice and slow
with a Peugeot.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.394
How about a hug from a VW Bug?

12:09.545 --> 12:11.621
Man, she's got some
fun car rhymes.

12:11.714 --> 12:15.291
Put your moose lips
on this Mitsubishi Eclipse.

12:15.310 --> 12:17.218
Out of options, Beef.

12:17.295 --> 12:19.887
Good thing I ran out to
Costume Castle before it closed.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.907
Mademoiselle Moose will be
ready for her big debut.

12:23.134 --> 12:25.893
It's no use, Wolf.
Looks like we'll be the ones

12:25.912 --> 12:28.062
saying au revoir
to our beautiful van.

12:28.156 --> 12:29.414
HAM:
Au revoir.

12:29.565 --> 12:30.415
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> So, uh,</i>

12:30.566 --> 12:31.899
you deliver the mail

12:31.918 --> 12:33.567
no matter what, rain or shine?

12:33.587 --> 12:34.978
Yup, I've seen it all--

12:35.071 --> 12:37.146
snowstorms, fires,
earthquakes.

12:37.165 --> 12:40.016
I've even delivered a package
during a hostage situation.

12:40.076 --> 12:42.761
The handcuffs made the signature
a little funky, but it worked.

12:42.912 --> 12:45.655
Here you go, Reggie. And
I pre-calculated the tip for you

12:45.673 --> 12:46.914
since you hate math.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.658
-Uh-oh.
-Whoa.
-Thank you, Leslie.

12:48.751 --> 12:50.602
All right, time for me
to make some cheddar

12:50.829 --> 12:51.844

12:51.938 --> 12:53.605
Um, could we tag along?
You know,

12:53.832 --> 12:56.682
so I could see what
the mailman life really entails?

12:56.835 --> 12:58.001
All righty.
I, uh, hope

12:58.094 --> 12:59.685
you really love
being outdoors like I do.

12:59.838 --> 13:02.596
You know what? A ride-along
on a boring, routine mail route

13:02.616 --> 13:04.690

for their one-day

Those branches

The moose is trying
to hide the van

to protect it from predators.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.085
It has adopted it as its child.

let the moose have a night out
on its own?

Uh, isn't it typically
only female moose

14:13.186 --> 14:14.410
that care for their young?

14:14.412 --> 14:15.520
We don't know this moose's life.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.081
Maybe he just likes being
a dad. Or-or maybe

14:18.099 --> 14:20.600
he had to take over jobs
as both mother and father

14:20.752 --> 14:23.010
because the van's mother
moved to Pennsylvania

14:23.104 --> 14:24.770
to be with
her moose lover Marcus.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.256
Aw, I didn't even think to ask.

14:27.258 --> 14:29.183
This is serious.
The moose would not be happy

14:29.277 --> 14:32.186
if we opened his child's door
and then sat in his child's body

14:32.205 --> 14:33.520
and drove his child around.

14:33.615 --> 14:35.615
Yeah, I don't have kids,
but I imagine

14:35.767 --> 14:37.041
I'll feel the same way one day.

14:37.268 --> 14:41.270

that could mean everybody wins.

14:41.289 --> 14:43.122
I love it when everybody wins.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.774
I also love it
when everybody loses.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.125
I just love playing.

14:46.277 --> 14:48.386
REGGIE: So, I set this
zip line up years ago,

You want to come with, kid?

14:54.452 --> 14:57.711
Oh, no. I-I mean, I'd love to,
but I know that rope.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.398
It's a Renegade. There's usually
about a 200-pound weight limit

15:00.625 --> 15:03.234
on there, and estimating
your weight at 150 pounds,

15:03.386 --> 15:06.479

-Moon!

You got great instincts.

excellent mailman one day, Moon,

15:13.729 --> 15:16.322
-uh... What'd you say
your last name was?
-Tobin.

15:16.474 --> 15:17.749
I know that name.
Yeah.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.751
I used to deliver to your family
before I switched over

15:19.827 --> 15:21.068
to the northern route.

15:21.162 --> 15:22.236
Wait, you did?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.088
Oh, yeah.
Your mom was a riot!

15:24.257 --> 15:26.925
Yeah, she'd love to distract me
and then steal packages

15:27.152 --> 15:29.652
off the back of my Jeep.
It was a felony but, man,

15:29.671 --> 15:30.762
it made me laugh.

15:30.989 --> 15:32.822
Wait, you actually knew my mom?

15:32.915 --> 15:34.507
Of course, man-- Leeny.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.825
You called her Leeny?

15:35.843 --> 15:37.101
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.

15:37.253 --> 15:38.995
You know, she was always home
during the day

15:39.013 --> 15:40.772
and she was constantly
offering me a beer

15:40.999 --> 15:42.607
and inviting me in.
Constantly.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.016
Oh. Oh, no...

15:44.169 --> 15:45.685
Maybe we should
stop talking about this.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.445
Yeah, last time I saw her

15:47.672 --> 15:49.447
was about ten years ago.
She said she had

15:49.674 --> 15:51.340
something real important to tell
me that would change my life,

15:51.434 --> 15:53.176
but then they transferred me

15:53.194 --> 15:54.360
to a new route
and I never delivered mail

15:54.529 --> 15:55.528
to your family again.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.937
Anyway, off I go.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.124
Holy stamps, this is dad news.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.205
-You okay there, Moon?
-Yep, yep.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.782
-Yep, yep, yep.
-Look, just because Reggie

16:08.876 --> 16:10.710
knew your mom
and drank with her

16:10.862 --> 16:11.877
and went in your house a bunch

16:12.046 --> 16:13.304
and has a lot
in common with you,

16:13.490 --> 16:15.956
it doesn't mean
that he's your...

16:16.050 --> 16:18.217
Reggie is definitely
my real dad.

16:18.294 --> 16:20.703
No. I mean, maybe not.

16:20.722 --> 16:22.313
I mean, Moon, sweetie,

16:22.540 --> 16:23.964
I don't totally
know what to say.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.674
I really wanted
to help you with math,

16:25.676 --> 16:28.135
but now I feel like the worst
big sister in the world.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.989
It's not your fault my mom
was a real mom-about-town.

16:31.216 --> 16:33.157
And if I was gonna be with
somebody when I found out

16:33.326 --> 16:35.718
this life-changing information
that I thought I wanted

16:35.737 --> 16:39.388
but now feel like barfing about,
I'm glad it was with you.

16:39.482 --> 16:40.740
Whee!

16:40.834 --> 16:43.893
Reggie, uh, this was fun,
but I think we got to go.

16:43.911 --> 16:45.503
Could you drop us off
at our car?

16:45.654 --> 16:48.172
Moon's dad is probably
wondering where we've been.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.416
Oh, of course, of course.
I bet I wouldn't like

16:50.568 --> 16:52.251
waiting for my kids
if I had them.

16:52.403 --> 16:55.013
But I guess I'll never be sure,
because I can't have kids.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.347
-Really?
-Wait, you can't?

16:56.499 --> 16:58.741
Nah, it wasn't possible
after the accident.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.335
I'll spare you the gory details,
but it was a bowling ball

17:01.354 --> 17:02.836
straight to my nuts
when I was 18

17:02.930 --> 17:05.023
and they cracked open
like eggs on Sunday morning.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.466
So, you definitely have no kids?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.176
Nope.
Oh, and while I was zippin',

17:09.270 --> 17:11.529
I remembered that your mom
did tell me that thing

17:11.680 --> 17:12.938
that she thought
was so important.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.258
She had made earrings
out of beer cans.

17:15.276 --> 17:16.534
She called them beerings.

17:16.685 --> 17:18.444
And then she got mad at me
when I wouldn't buy them

17:18.596 --> 17:20.446
and she chased me
off the property with a knife.

17:20.598 --> 17:23.958
-Sounds like Mom.
-Anyway, I'll drop you guys
back at your car.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.379
What's going on in that
little bear brain, Moon?

17:28.606 --> 17:30.697
Well, I'm super glad
Dad's my dad,

17:30.866 --> 17:34.110
but if genetics aren't the
reason that I'm failing math,

17:34.128 --> 17:36.387
then I'm just
the stupid one of the family.

17:36.614 --> 17:38.447
That's not what it means.
What it means

17:38.466 --> 17:39.706
is you're just different
from your family,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.117
and that's not a bad thing.

17:41.135 --> 17:43.043
You know who else is different
from their family?

17:43.063 --> 17:45.563
Shania Twain?
The Incredible Hulk?

17:45.732 --> 17:46.972
-Me.
-And you're great.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.049
Yeah, I am.
And you're not dumb.

17:49.143 --> 17:50.735
In fact, you were talking
all kinds of math

17:50.886 --> 17:53.813
about that zip line. I think
outdoor stuff is your in, Moon.

17:53.965 --> 17:56.132
Huh. Yeah.
I guess you're right.

17:56.150 --> 17:58.576
I didn't get nervous
thinking about that rope.

17:58.653 --> 18:00.561
But when the numbers
are just numbers on paper,

18:00.655 --> 18:02.062
I get freaked out.

18:02.231 --> 18:04.657
I know I'm gonna fail
that make-up test tomorrow.

18:04.809 --> 18:06.325
Remember when I said
I'm a big ideas person?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.495
I just had another one, and it's
almost as good as turtletinis.

18:09.647 --> 18:11.330
I don't know if turtletinis
are for turtles

18:11.407 --> 18:14.258
or if they have a little turtle
in 'em, but it'll come to me.

18:14.335 --> 18:15.985
Thank you for letting Moon
take his make-up test

18:16.003 --> 18:17.578
out here, Mrs. Hill.
I think

18:17.597 --> 18:20.080
you'll see that
this is where he really shines.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.657
I'm only doing this
'cause Gibbons said he would

18:21.750 --> 18:23.917
give me a week off
to go on my Metallica cruise.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.828
Moon, how old was that tree?

18:25.847 --> 18:27.438
I see 72 two rings.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.756
Which means
it was 72 two years old.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.017
And if I had four of these
trees, how many years

18:32.112 --> 18:34.278
would they have
collectively been alive?

18:34.430 --> 18:35.671
Two hundred and eighty eight.

18:35.690 --> 18:37.340
Okay. And what if we
chop that tree down

18:37.508 --> 18:39.099
to build a fire that lasts
four hours and three logs

18:39.193 --> 18:41.268
burn an hour--
how many logs do we need?

18:41.362 --> 18:43.437
-Twelve.
-Now imagine
we get trapped out here

18:43.456 --> 18:45.790
and need to eat Mrs. Hill
to stay alive.

18:45.941 --> 18:47.458
Estimating her height
as five nine,

18:47.610 --> 18:49.127
and assuming we're gonna
eat about five inches per day,

18:49.278 --> 18:52.021
how many days until
we run out of teacher meat?

18:52.114 --> 18:53.965
Well, we would probably
start on her legs, so...

18:54.192 --> 18:56.041
Okay, you can stop.
I've heard enough.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.469
Moon, you clearly
understand math in this setting,

18:58.621 --> 19:01.046
and I will adjust your grade
to just barely passing.

19:01.199 --> 19:04.625
Yeah! I kicked math's ass.
And for the record,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.627
we could probably survive
on Mrs. Hill's meat

19:06.721 --> 19:10.055
for about 13 days,
provided we eat the eyes.

19:10.132 --> 19:12.299
We just have to make
this old snow machine

19:12.393 --> 19:14.560
more enticing
as the moose's baby.

19:14.712 --> 19:17.062
We begin by covering
the infant in salt.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.548
I recorded some baby moose
sounds from the Internet

19:19.567 --> 19:21.717
and then added
a little of my own flair.

19:21.777 --> 19:25.329
And I'll swaddle up this little
snow machine in my baby blanket.

19:25.481 --> 19:26.998
Everyone ready?

19:27.725 --> 19:29.250
<i> (wailing)</i>

19:31.820 --> 19:32.837
He doesn't seem interested.

19:33.064 --> 19:34.821
What if we put the snow machine

19:34.990 --> 19:36.415
inside a little pumpkin,
you know,

19:36.567 --> 19:39.719
-like those baby calendars?
-Give it a minute.

19:48.413 --> 19:52.248
There he goes. Oh, papa Moose
has left the building.

19:52.341 --> 19:54.174
BEEF (crying):
The cats in the cradle
and the silver spoon.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.770
Little boy blue
and the something, something

19:57.922 --> 20:00.347
and I forget the lyrics.

20:00.441 --> 20:01.273
Hey, Dad.

20:01.426 --> 20:03.016
Hey, son.
Ready for tuck-in?

20:03.110 --> 20:05.444
You bet.
How did the moose debacle end?

20:05.521 --> 20:07.538
I saw the van
is back to being an orphan.

20:07.615 --> 20:10.983
Yeah. There's a powerful bond
between a father and child.

20:11.118 --> 20:12.952
It's like us.
But no one--

20:13.046 --> 20:15.454
and I mean no one, son--
is gonna trick me

20:15.606 --> 20:17.456
into trading you
for an old snow machine.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.942
Dad, I have something
to show you.

20:20.035 --> 20:22.294
I hid the report cards.
I'm sorry.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.113
I didn't want you
to see my math grade.

20:24.131 --> 20:27.132
But Honeybee helped me study and
I passed my make-up test today.

20:27.285 --> 20:29.134
I'm sure glad she did that,
because I probably

20:29.229 --> 20:31.211
-wouldn't have been much help.
-You wouldn't?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.730
I've hid it pretty well,
but I've never been

20:32.881 --> 20:36.141
any good at math. Sorry
you inherited that from me.

20:36.294 --> 20:38.477
That's okay, Dad.
I kind of like that I did.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.738
At least you didn't get
my extra-long second toe.

20:40.965 --> 20:42.740
It's true.
Mine are all the same size,

20:42.967 --> 20:44.224
like a little spice rack.

20:44.393 --> 20:46.635
But Moon, if you ever
do need anything,

20:46.729 --> 20:49.247
I'm always here to help.
Or at least to try.

20:49.398 --> 20:50.581
Okay. I need

20:50.733 --> 20:53.976
a TenPoint Vapor RS70
Crossbow Package, please.

20:53.995 --> 20:57.421
Ha! Those are $4,000.
How about a hug instead?
