00:05.088 --> 00:06.463
Hey, new wallet?

00:06.673 --> 00:07.798
It was time.

00:08.007 --> 00:12.302
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

00:12.512 --> 00:16.140
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.101
I know,
but the garbage was full.

00:19.894 --> 00:22.312
Have you ever taken out the trash?

00:23.231 --> 00:26.692
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.323
- Third door on the left.
- Right!

00:43.418 --> 00:44.710
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.105
What are you doing?

01:05.272 --> 01:08.650
Um... Oh! Oh!

01:10.403 --> 01:11.487
I'm sorry.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.489
It's a little old but...

01:15.158 --> 01:18.285
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.580
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.501
Aw, of course not.
You're a little princess.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.420
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.339
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

01:30.548 --> 01:34.510
Daddy, make the cast of Cats
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.429
You think you can come here...

01:37.680 --> 01:41.517
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

01:41.726 --> 01:44.812
Think of someone else for a change.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.651
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.202
God, if you're going to cry about it!

02:51.880 --> 02:54.715
- Whoa, whoa! Treeger made you cry?
- Yes.

02:55.383 --> 02:59.720
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.723
I'll teach him a lesson.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.475
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

03:05.685 --> 03:09.605
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

03:09.772 --> 03:13.108
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

03:15.361 --> 03:16.445
My God.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.863
Is this a gym card?

03:18.072 --> 03:20.282
Oh, yeah, gym member.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.077
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

03:24.287 --> 03:25.746
...the last 1200 times.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.291
So why don't you quit?

03:30.126 --> 03:32.002
You don't think I've tried?

03:34.464 --> 03:38.300
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

03:38.635 --> 03:41.720
They make you go
all the way down there.

03:42.138 --> 03:46.391
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.727
And then they bring out Maria.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.439
- Who is Maria?
- Oh, Maria!

03:54.067 --> 03:55.609
You can't say no to her.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.613
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.409
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.579
- No.
- You're strong enough to face her?

04:07.789 --> 04:09.790
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.338
Tribbiani.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.839
Hold on. I'll get the plunger.

04:20.677 --> 04:25.013
Hey. You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.349
So you'll go and apologize to her...

04:27.600 --> 04:29.559
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

04:29.811 --> 04:30.978
And tell him what?

04:31.187 --> 04:33.689
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."

04:33.982 --> 04:38.443
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.446
I have actually not heard of that.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.826
Your friends are violating it.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.579
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.373
I'm telling the landlord...

04:51.582 --> 04:54.835
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.337
Your friends are out of here, pal.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.717
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

05:05.471 --> 05:08.140
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.599
What's the matter?

05:09.851 --> 05:12.978
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.896
Every time I see him,
I want to...

05:15.189 --> 05:17.524
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.696
So do them for free.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.907
No, it is forbidden.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.621
No, no. Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.333
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.209
They make you take one?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.211
No, I made myself take one.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.672
No fooling around with clients...

05:40.882 --> 05:43.258
...and, um, always be prepared.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.098
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.769
Why not give him to someone else?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.730
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.442
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

06:00.943 --> 06:02.361
You got a pedicure.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.071
Your feet are all dressed up.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.659
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

06:11.788 --> 06:13.872
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

06:14.457 --> 06:17.334
I don't know what
you're talking about. Heh.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.796
How do you explain the toe ring?

06:23.299 --> 06:27.135
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

06:32.850 --> 06:34.393
My hero! What happened?

06:35.603 --> 06:38.647
Well, I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.857
And he better apologize.
See you!

06:41.150 --> 06:42.651
Wait a minute.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.529
- What did he say?
- Uh...

06:45.696 --> 06:49.366
He wouldn't apologize, because
you're living here illegally.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.369
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

06:52.620 --> 06:55.831
- You got us evicted?
- I told you not to go down there.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.332
He made Rachel cry!

06:57.542 --> 06:59.251
Rachel always cries!

07:00.503 --> 07:02.546
That's not true!

07:04.340 --> 07:07.217
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.262
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

07:11.556 --> 07:13.640
All right, I'll try.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.852
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.229
- Go!
- All right, all right.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.065
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

07:27.196 --> 07:31.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Remember what
we talked about. You got to be strong.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.368
Yes, yes!

07:33.744 --> 07:35.078
Now one more time.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.539
Don't you want a washboard stomach...

07:37.707 --> 07:38.874
...and rock-hard pecs?

07:39.041 --> 07:42.711
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.881
- Good. That's good.
- Okay.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.096
I want to quit the gym.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.223
You want to quit?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.687
I want to quit the gym.

08:01.230 --> 08:05.484
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

08:11.407 --> 08:13.492
I want to quit the gym.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.746
Dave in the Membership Office
handles quitters.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.417
Excuse me. Are you a member?

08:23.085 --> 08:24.211
Me?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.506
- No.
- Sorry. Members only.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.219
I want to quit the gym!

08:32.428 --> 08:35.013
It's okay, man. Be strong.

08:40.727 --> 08:43.855
So are you a member of any gym?

08:44.106 --> 08:47.776
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.528
Okay, no problem.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.112
Could you come here?

08:54.158 --> 08:55.617
Hi, I'm Maria.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.494
Hi, M...

09:11.008 --> 09:12.968
Wow. You have really pretty feet.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.179
These old things? Ha.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.685
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.980
You mean...

09:25.147 --> 09:27.649
By sciatic, you mean...

09:27.942 --> 09:29.943
...the towel-covered portion?

09:30.152 --> 09:31.194
Yeah.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.697
Sure, I can do that.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.576
Because, um, the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

09:37.827 --> 09:40.203
...real nice and tight.

09:43.708 --> 09:48.962
Yeah. So, um, tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

09:49.171 --> 09:51.840
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.425
Oh.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.101
Ow!

10:03.561 --> 10:05.770
- Did you just bite me?
- No!

10:14.196 --> 10:15.238
What?

10:15.489 --> 10:18.867
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.745
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

10:22.121 --> 10:25.415
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

10:25.875 --> 10:29.252
- You have pets?
- No. No, no, no.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.046
Those are, uh, nicknames.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.757
I'm the chick,
and Chandler's the duck.

10:34.216 --> 10:38.261
Huh. I would've thought
it was the other way around.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.640
Come on. Let the girls stay.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.558
I'll do whatever you want.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.644
Really? You'd do anything?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.145
Yeah, absolutely.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.398
- I got something.
- What is it?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.445
Can you be my dancing partner?

10:58.282 --> 11:00.283
That's not prison lingo, is it?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.752
- His dancing partner?
- Yeah.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.381
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball."

11:16.717 --> 11:20.512
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.722
Why not practice with a girl?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.015
He's too shy.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.227
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.395
Yeah, right.

11:28.604 --> 11:32.941
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.945
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.201
- Hey.
- So did you quit?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.036
No. I almost did.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.665
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.209
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.132
And that's funny, why?

11:57.425 --> 11:59.300
Oh, ahem...

11:59.468 --> 12:03.805
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and...

12:05.141 --> 12:06.141
Well, that's it.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.144
We're doomed.

12:09.311 --> 12:13.773
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

12:13.941 --> 12:14.983
What'll we do?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.069
You could actually go to the gym.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.492
Or...

12:24.660 --> 12:26.828
Or we could go to the bank...

12:27.079 --> 12:30.915
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.960
You're a genius.

12:34.211 --> 12:37.505
Oh, man! But then
we won't be bank buddies.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.841
Now there's two reasons.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.138
Hey.

12:45.347 --> 12:49.517
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

12:49.727 --> 12:50.852
I bit him.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.774
- Where?
- On the tushy.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.193
And that's not against your oath?

12:59.195 --> 13:01.863
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

13:02.031 --> 13:06.242
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.163
Next time, try to distract yourself.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.874
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

13:13.167 --> 13:16.044
...and I don't want to get too...

13:16.295 --> 13:17.712
...excited.

13:17.963 --> 13:21.758
I try and think of other things.
Like, uh, sandwiches...

13:21.967 --> 13:23.760
...and, uh, baseball...

13:25.888 --> 13:27.388
...and, uh, Chandler.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.559
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.861
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.113
Okay, uh, well...

13:44.281 --> 13:46.241
...just follow my lead.

13:47.868 --> 13:51.371
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.706
Like get really drunk?

13:53.916 --> 13:57.585
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.761
I'm sorry.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.014
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

14:10.224 --> 14:12.225
...my breasts are coming out my back.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.603
Ah, forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.064
My mom was right.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.109
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.947
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.534
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.328
Marge will never go for me.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.957
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.959
You just need more practice.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.378
Come on. Let's try it again.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.385
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.889
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a... Whee-hee!

14:52.224 --> 14:53.641
- Hey!
- Yeah.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.898
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

15:03.485 --> 15:05.987
Ha-ha-ha. You guys owe me bigtime.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.368
What was that?

15:13.412 --> 15:16.748
- What?
- You just did a little dancy thing.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.250
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.295
- You did a little hop.
- You are so enjoying this.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.838
No, I'm not.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.133
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourrée.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.388
You know the words!

15:32.598 --> 15:34.265
You are so into this!

15:34.516 --> 15:38.895
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

15:39.855 --> 15:44.150
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.445
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.698
It's like a sport, it's manly.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.826
- Show me some "manly" moves.
- All right.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.374
I don't know how to lead.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.049
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.385
We'd like to close our accounts.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.137
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

16:14.098 --> 16:16.933
- No, no.
- No, we'd just like to close them.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.226
Okay...

16:18.727 --> 16:21.020
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.231
Would you come over here, please?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.234
Hi, I'm Karen.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.237
I want to quit the bank!

16:33.742 --> 16:35.576
Okay. Baseball.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.455
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.083
Maybe even his pants
come down a little.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.751
Oh, no, wait! No.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.587
Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches. Um...

16:46.880 --> 16:48.715
Okay, on a plate.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.759
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.
No! No!

16:53.178 --> 16:54.554
Chandler.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.890
Okay, Chandler. Ooh, that's working!

17:05.273 --> 17:08.067
Chandler's knees.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.404
Chandler's ankles.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.614
Chandler's ankle hair.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.241
Oh, no!

17:16.285 --> 17:17.910
Okay, you're all set. Heh.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.621
Oh, wow! That was amazing!

17:20.914 --> 17:23.290
- Was that really just an hour?
- Yeah.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.586
In really long hour-world.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.920
What?

17:28.630 --> 17:30.423
Ugh! Okay...

17:31.925 --> 17:33.801
I have an enormous crush on you.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.888
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

17:37.139 --> 17:39.932
...even though you give me
the feelings.

17:40.684 --> 17:43.311
Wow. I had no idea.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.229
But, uh...

17:45.439 --> 17:47.523
I can always find another masseuse.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.025
Really?

17:49.276 --> 17:51.235
Yeah, really.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.575
What?

17:57.785 --> 18:00.161
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.664
Quiet down.

18:07.336 --> 18:09.837
Mr. Simon's been waiting...
Oh, my God!

18:10.089 --> 18:11.547
Why wasn't I offered that?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.592
I'd definitely pay more for that.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.764
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.809
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

18:23.018 --> 18:25.561
...because Rick is, um, my husband.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.313
Oh, really?

18:27.523 --> 18:29.690
You'd better tell his other wife.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.443
She called three times
asking where he is.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.782
Yes, I will tell her.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.204
- So you didn't leave the bank?
- No.

18:43.372 --> 18:47.208
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.670
What will you ever use that for?

18:50.879 --> 18:53.381
To pay for the gym.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.592
Hey!

18:56.802 --> 18:58.803
So I had a great day.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.389
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.851
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.102
What?

19:06.478 --> 19:08.146
- You got fired?
- Oh, my gosh!

19:08.397 --> 19:12.233
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.068
Sweetie.

19:14.319 --> 19:18.322
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

19:18.574 --> 19:23.202
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.581
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.584
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.425
Hey, Duck. Is Chick here?

19:40.220 --> 19:43.055
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.434
Ready for our last practice?

19:46.685 --> 19:50.771
We're not getting that spin right,
because my place is small.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.442
- Want to use our place?
- No, I had another idea.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.985
We did it!

20:38.570 --> 20:40.321
That was incredible!

20:40.572 --> 20:44.075
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

20:44.284 --> 20:47.245
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani. Heh.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.622
Oh, my God! Look at the time.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.916
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.585
Oh! Okay...

20:54.962 --> 20:56.462
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

20:56.713 --> 21:00.716
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.469
Aw, thanks, but no.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.473
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.350
Okay, heh...

21:09.601 --> 21:11.852
- Go get them, Treeger.
- Right.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.733
Hey, uh...

21:17.943 --> 21:19.860
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.113
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.991
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.867
No, I'm good.

21:44.594 --> 21:47.388
You've got great experience.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.890
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

21:50.058 --> 21:51.892
They thought I was a whore.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.273
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.235
Great. Thank you very much.
