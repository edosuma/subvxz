01:17.240 --> 01:21.597
And today, on And Yet It Lived,
meet Simeon Pathetica...

01:21.800 --> 01:24.792
...an ape that even ev olution
passed by.

01:37.640 --> 01:42.270
Note the stooped shoulders
and the dull, blank look.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.908
- Can I have your autograph?
- Not today, Peg, I got some big news.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.470
You know how I'm always digging
in my ear with the point of a pencil?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.711
- Oh, my, this is good news.
- You betcha.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.831
Well, today, purely by accident...

02:00.040 --> 02:03.953
...I found out that I was using
the wrong end of the pencil.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.393
I discovered that if you turn it around
and take off the eraser...

02:08.600 --> 02:12.513
...you can get a real kind of
suction action going.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.475
Get a load of this, honey.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.436
But, honey, it still has
an eraser on it.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.513
That's not an eraser.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.954
Oh, my God.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.918
- What's for supper?
- What would you like?

02:38.120 --> 02:40.350
I'd like a nice, juicy steak.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.269
Why, that's just waiting for you
on the table.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.270
Made you look, made you look.
Al, you'll never learn.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.630
So, honey, I was thinking.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.593
Don't you think we need
a little savings account?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.997
You know, like any
moderately successful 13-year-old?

03:00.200 --> 03:03.351
Hey, don't kid yourself.
I got plenty of money saved up.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.790
Well, it doesn't matter,
you're not getting any.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.150
I'm gonna get me a Big Boy
socket-wrench set.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.078
Man, it's gonna be great.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.319
I can go around this house and tighten
more nuts than you did in high school.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.996
Yes, and I have the trophies
to prove it.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.039
Anyway, Al, I've got some news...

03:30.240 --> 03:32.800
...and I've been waiting for the right...
- Wait, hold it.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.912
I'll bet that's some of the guys
wanting to see my eraser.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.430
Al, Peggy, we have
a little announcement.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.679
Jefferson and I are pregnant.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.955
Oh, Marcie, that's great.
You're kidding?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.515
Yep, yep, yep.
I knew it right away too.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.870
You know how when Michael Jordan's
in the air...

03:58.080 --> 04:00.116
...he just knows he'll do
something special?

04:00.320 --> 04:04.233
Well, I had the same feeling
when I approached the hoop.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.399
There was no blocking that shot,
eh, baby?

04:10.800 --> 04:15.954
- Oh, isn't this wonderful, Al?
- Yeah, Al, I'm gonna be a father.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.630
- Don't you have anything to say to me?
- Oh, sure.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.752
You're a dead man. It's all over.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.316
Today is the first day
of the end of your life.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.955
Hey, I'm looking forward
to being a father.

04:40.160 --> 04:44.312
To hear my child say its first words,
take its first steps.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.512
Yeah, keep that in mind when you're
at the newsstand at 3 a. M...

04:47.720 --> 04:51.190
...praying they'll be asleep before you
get home with your copy of Heinie.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.951
What a grand jest.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.551
Yeah, soon my hellhounds will be out
of the house and I'll be free, free, free.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.875
Except for her.

05:02.520 --> 05:07.071
God, I feel great. I'm almost happy.
Let me revel in it.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.829
- I think this is a good time to tell you...
- No, not now, babe.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.632
Once my kids leave the house...

05:12.840 --> 05:15.798
...I'll finally be able to do
what every man is supposed to do.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.752
I can watch TV.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.598
I can...

05:23.880 --> 05:26.075
Well, I don't know,
but it doesn't matter.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.313
It's still better than having
a screaming, crapping...

05:29.520 --> 05:35.470
...money-sucking little vampire
bobsledding me to the cemetery.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.148
God, I feel good.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.590
- Honey?
- Yes.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.199
- Guess what.
- What?

05:42.400 --> 05:45.437
I'm pregnant too.

06:03.680 --> 06:08.117
Oh, Al, hold me.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.790
- How far along are you?
- Five months.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.950
Well, Al, I mean, didn't you notice
I was getting fat?

06:19.160 --> 06:22.550
Well, yeah.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.274
- Oh, hold me.
- Well, no, wait a second, stop.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.429
That can't be right. When? Why?

06:31.720 --> 06:33.392
How?

06:34.040 --> 06:37.237
Wait a second.
Let me check my journal.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.270
- Five months ago, you say?
- Oh, Al, isn't it a dream?

06:42.480 --> 06:44.471
It better be.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.074
Let's see, now. April, April...
Here we go, April. Week one:

06:51.280 --> 06:53.589
"Sold shoes, watched TV."

06:53.800 --> 06:57.679
Week two, "Sold shoes,
watched TV, wept."

06:58.440 --> 07:02.353
Week three, "Sold shoes,
had a few beers, passed out."

07:11.000 --> 07:16.199
"I dreamt I fell in the washing machine,
woke up feeling cheap."

07:18.600 --> 07:21.239
Peg, what in God's green earth
did you do to me?

07:22.280 --> 07:24.350
Well, I couldn't help myself.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.997
You looked so cute trying to pull
your underwear up over your head.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.275
- Well, I'm not made of stone, you know.
- Peggy, this is so exciting.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.837
- We can be pregnant together.
- Yeah, Al, congratulations.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.315
This is great. Gee, our kids'll
grow up together...

07:40.520 --> 07:43.034
...and they'll be old enough
to leave the nest together.

07:43.240 --> 07:48.519
Gee, I'll be in my 50s when
that happens, and you'll be, what, 102?

07:52.360 --> 07:54.828
Oh, Marcie, this is so wonderful.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.952
The pitter-patter of little feet
after 18 years.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.391
This is truly a joyous day for us all.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.231
What did you do?

08:20.800 --> 08:23.678
Can't you control your animal urges?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.515
Of all the bonehead blunders
a middle-aged man...

08:26.720 --> 08:29.234
...with no income can make.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.231
God, you leave him alone
for one second...

08:33.440 --> 08:37.318
Did you not know the evil implications
of your deed?

08:37.679 --> 08:42.833
Bad Daddy. Bad, bad. Bad.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.069
So, Mr. Sow-My-Wild-Oats-At-50...

08:49.040 --> 08:50.951
...what are we gonna do now?

08:51.160 --> 08:52.752
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.798
We'll be living off
the scraps of scraps.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.878
Slipping in puddles of baby juice.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.629
Our home and our clothes
smelling of the befouled buttocks...

09:02.840 --> 09:06.355
...of a child born
out of middle-aged lust.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.874
Oh, shame.

09:10.200 --> 09:15.718
As if what you did wasn't bad enough,
but with our mother, for God's sake.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.471
Well, this is one fine " How you doing?
Fine, thank you."

09:25.200 --> 09:30.399
- Hi, kids. Did Daddy tell you the news?
- Mommy, Mommy, we're so happy.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.909
Happy, happy.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.914
Now, kids, I don't want you
to be jealous of the baby...

09:36.120 --> 09:37.997
...because I'll always
have time for you.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.715
After all, you were my first.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.271
I was your first.

09:44.760 --> 09:49.356
Really? Oh, well.
What's important now is the baby.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.709
- Did you congratulate your father?
- Oh, sure.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.388
- Way to go, Dad. You sure know.
- Yeah. Oh, you...

09:57.600 --> 10:01.115
- You old dog. You old...
- That's great. It's just fabulous.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.117
Well, I don't know about anybody else,
but I've got a hankering...

10:06.320 --> 10:08.914
...for a nice cream-cheese-
and-coffee-grind sandwich.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.836
- We love you, Mommy.
- We love you, Mommy.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.996
- You stink.
- You stink.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.360
Do you think it's safe for Mom
to have a baby at her age?

10:18.560 --> 10:20.710
I mean, what is she, a million?

10:24.840 --> 10:28.515
All right. Now, listen up, everyone.
Just because I'm pregnant...

10:28.720 --> 10:31.712
...I don't want you to think
I'm gonna be demanding or anything.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.559
Your lives won't change a bit.

10:36.720 --> 10:42.955
"And here's a picture of Mr. Rooster.
'Cock-a-doodle-doo."'

10:44.960 --> 10:48.270
Honey, not to me, to the baby.

10:49.920 --> 10:55.677
"And the duck went 'quack, quack.'
And the dog went 'bow-wow.'

10:55.880 --> 10:58.348
- And the family went to..."
- Excuse me, honey.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.598
What, are you guys on vacation?
Rub, rub.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.112
Thanks for everything,
Johnny Appleseed.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.637
Bundy, Bundy.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.197
Bundy, you're gonna be a superstar!
Just don't blow it, kid.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.109
Come on, coach.
What could possibly stop me?

11:34.320 --> 11:36.197
Hi, honey.

11:37.400 --> 11:42.110
- Oh, Al, are you as happy as I am?
- Well, how could I be?

11:42.360 --> 11:45.079
Well, you should be happy.
It's your baby too.

11:45.280 --> 11:49.239
Oh, happy, I thought you said
am I as heavy as you are.

11:50.320 --> 11:54.313
Now, stop teasing me.
You can barely tell that I'm pregnant.

11:56.680 --> 11:59.114
Get over there.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.717
Bologna and Miracle Whip.
Want some?

12:06.840 --> 12:11.709
Gee, Al, I don't know about you,
but I'm horny as hell.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.153
Well, so am I, but you don't see me
bothering you with it, do you?

12:17.960 --> 12:19.188
Oh, come on, Al.

12:19.400 --> 12:23.598
If you don't, the baby won't see you fail
till you take it to work.

12:26.720 --> 12:32.192
That was a good one, wasn't it? Yes.
We got Daddy good, huh?

12:32.400 --> 12:35.392
So, what do you say, Al?
Are you ready?

12:35.600 --> 12:38.353
Oh, sure, I'm all afire.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.632
I don't know what turns me on more...

12:40.840 --> 12:43.195
...that sexy failure talk
or the bologna shrapnel...

12:43.400 --> 12:46.312
...hitting me in the eye
at 90 miles an hour.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.274
Oh, all right, you big sissy.
We don't have to do it.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.153
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.392
Jeez.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.995
- AI?
- What?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.952
Let's talk about the baby.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.073
Why, did he do something cute?

13:14.320 --> 13:17.949
You have a terrible attitude.
I am not talking to you anymore.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.277
You stink. Good night.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.032
Al?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.840
What should we name the baby?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.036
The Reaper?

13:36.720 --> 13:39.188
Well, what if it's a boy?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.795
Well, we could name it
after my father.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.912
I don't wanna name it Town Drunk.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.275
Well, then don't ask me.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.430
- AI, can we afford this baby?
- No.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.952
I didn't think so.
Gee, I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.237
Good night.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.757
- AI, Al, Al.
- AI?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.234
- AI.
- AI?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.351
- AI. Al.
- AI? Al?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.437
What?

14:25.880 --> 14:27.871
Honey, you know,
I was just thinking.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.356
If you wanted to get an extra job,
you know, after the baby was born...

14:31.560 --> 14:34.120
...maybe you could get one
delivering newspapers.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.197
You know how they throw them
on the porch?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.312
You'd be really good at that
because you used to play football.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.431
You remember?

14:48.960 --> 14:51.554
Oh, hi, honey.
You wanna come and join us?

14:51.760 --> 14:54.832
We were talking about breast swell.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.953
Well, congratulations, Marcie,
you finally get to go bra shopping.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.390
Oh, Al, I don't have to tell you...

15:08.600 --> 15:12.752
...how much easier it is
to lug around small things.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.314
Now, Al, if you have nothing
to add to the conversation...

15:18.520 --> 15:19.953
...just please go sit down.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.953
Not here. Can't you see
we're pregnant?

15:26.160 --> 15:30.039
Now, go sit over on the stairs
in case I need something.

15:32.720 --> 15:36.759
This is my home and I will not
be relegated to sitting on stairs.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.716
I go anywhere I want!
Anybody got a problem with that?

15:45.360 --> 15:47.794
You two are on thin ice!

15:49.080 --> 15:51.833
Who are you gonna
tell the baby he is?

15:53.480 --> 15:54.879
Well, for the first 10 years...

15:55.080 --> 15:58.356
...Bud and Kelly thought
he was the dim-witted handyman.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.796
So why change what works?

16:02.120 --> 16:06.318
Well, at least I have no complaints.
My Jefferson can't do enough for me.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.557
Would you believe, right now,
he is out getting me a pie.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.150
Sometimes he is so good to me
it just brings tears to my eyes.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.239
Well, here it is.

16:16.440 --> 16:20.319
I drove 50 miles holding it up so
the cherries didn't settle on the bottom.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.515
This is not a large.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.479
Is this all you think of me?
Is this all you think of your child?

16:29.680 --> 16:32.194
Well, you just march yourself
right back to Wisconsin...

16:32.400 --> 16:36.678
...and get me a real pie, mister,
or you don't love our baby!

16:40.520 --> 16:45.878
Okay, honey, I'll be right back
with another pie, you stinking, slimy...

16:51.360 --> 16:53.396
He spoils me so.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.234
Well, my Al spoils me too.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.193
Al, get me some water.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.829
Look, it's Harry Hormone.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.036
Use a condom, go to jail, eh, Dad?

17:19.680 --> 17:22.637
- Hey, Mom, we made the list.
- Oh, good idea.

17:22.839 --> 17:26.230
I'll have Jefferson make one for me.
What kind of list is it?

17:26.440 --> 17:30.399
Well, see, I'm gonna be the best mother
in the world to my new baby...

17:30.600 --> 17:33.751
...so I asked the kids to make a list
of everything they never had...

17:33.960 --> 17:37.669
...so I'll know everything to do
for my little "precious-wecious."

17:37.880 --> 17:40.348
Although, I can't imagine
what they'd put on this list.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.836
I mean, they had everything
they could possibly want as babies.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.589
But let's just see what they thought
they didn't have.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.037
"Milk.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.593
Immunity vaccinations.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.952
Love." Oh, you scamps.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.589
- "Rednig blicks"?
- That's "reading blocks." I wrote that.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.433
Well, I think that's a good idea.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.832
Bud, why don't you be in charge
of helping the baby with those.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.275
Thanks, kids.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.073
Mom, you...
You're just kidding...

18:17.280 --> 18:19.510
...that this kid's gonna get
the stuff we didn't.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.915
I mean, you're gonna love us
all the same, right?

18:22.480 --> 18:25.074
Oh, well, of course I will.

18:25.280 --> 18:30.798
We were a family before the baby,
and we'll be a family after the baby.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.237
Now, you're sucking up
all the baby's air.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.431
Go sit with your father.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.358
I was just born to be a mother.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.630
Look how far down
the chain of love we are.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.474
She's got us sitting with him.

18:54.280 --> 18:59.912
Oh, what an odious mess we weave
when first we practice to conceive.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.189
Now, kids, I know you think
this is bad for you.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.073
But in a little while, you'll be up
and out of the house...

19:07.280 --> 19:09.157
...and on your own
in just two, three...

19:13.800 --> 19:15.631
...30 years.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.758
So as you can see, the only one
whose life has truly ended is...

19:22.160 --> 19:23.798
...Daddy.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.396
That's true, yeah.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.040
Oh, my God, what have I done?

21:52.920 --> 21:55.480
You still don't know, do you?

21:56.720 --> 21:58.756
Kids, no matter what
the future might bring...

21:58.960 --> 22:00.757
...it's nice to know
that we're a family.

22:00.960 --> 22:05.272
We'll go through things together.
Who'll give me a "Whoa, Bundy"?

22:06.720 --> 22:09.518
What do you want from me?
I wasn't even awake.

22:10.305 --> 22:16.476
