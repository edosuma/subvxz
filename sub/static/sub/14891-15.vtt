Oh!

01:48.842 --> 01:50.777
Helloo‐oo!

01:56.583 --> 01:59.452
Cousin, do you think these
oranges are scratch ’n’ sniff?

02:01.855 --> 02:03.323
Will you stop it? Stop it!

02:03.356 --> 02:06.326
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

02:06.359 --> 02:08.294
You begged me to let you
come along to this auction

02:08.328 --> 02:10.931
and I said you could come
as long as you obeyed the rules.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.198
Now what are the rules?

02:12.232 --> 02:13.667
Don’t touch anything

02:13.700 --> 02:15.636
don’t say anything,
don’t do anything.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.839
Those are the rules.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.508
And a fine set of rules
they are.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.610
Oh, look, cousin, wind chimes.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.945
W‐will you stop it?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.548
‐I‐I‐I...
‐Stop it! Stop it, please!

02:28.615 --> 02:30.651
Look at all this stuff, cousin.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.185
They’re gonna have to move
some of this out

02:32.218 --> 02:35.288
if they want to have an auction.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.692
Balki, these are the things
that are going to be auctioned.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.828
All the worldly goods
of the late Howell Thurston

02:41.862 --> 02:44.698
waiting to be sold.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.534
They’re gonna sell all of his
stuff just because he’s late?

02:51.337 --> 02:53.807
‐That hardly seems fair.
‐Mm‐hmm.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.408
[gasps]
Oh!

02:55.441 --> 02:57.644
No, Balki, he’s dead.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.513
Well, if he’s dead...

02:59.546 --> 03:01.615
...there’s a very small chance
he’ll ever show up.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.853
Now, cousin, look at this.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.589
‐Now I‐I like bronze.
‐Mm‐hmm.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.923
But you know, with bronze

03:09.956 --> 03:12.559
you’ve got to polish,
polish, polish.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.694
See right there?

03:13.727 --> 03:14.828
[spits]

03:16.462 --> 03:19.900
‐I...
‐Don’t spit on her thigh.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.669
But she has...
She was...

03:22.703 --> 03:25.371
Oh, oh, cousin,
no, no, no, no.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.677
Cousin, not again.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.946
We‐we’re nowhere near
any power tools.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.681
Please, listen‐‐

03:34.715 --> 03:36.583
Balki...

03:36.617 --> 03:38.885
Mr. Thurston was a very rich man

03:38.919 --> 03:41.487
who died without any relatives

03:41.522 --> 03:43.456
and for some reason
Mr. Wainwright thought

03:43.489 --> 03:47.293
that this auction would make
a very interesting story.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.563
Well, of course, it would make
an interesting story.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.397
Auctions always do.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.399
You know, we have auctions
on Mypos.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.937
We call them Toejamiki Tomdicari
Viciversi Oomh Oomh Gari.

04:00.841 --> 04:04.545
Toejamiki Tomdicari
Viciversi Oomh Oomh Gari?

04:08.448 --> 04:12.519
Yes, it means, "One man’s socks
are another man’s mittens."

04:14.621 --> 04:16.523
‐Fascinating.
‐Hmm.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.429
Oh, cousin. Cousin, look,
they have refreshments.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.298
We better...
We better get ours now.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.834
It don’t look like
there’s enough to go around.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.704
[grunts]
No! Stop it! Stop it!

04:30.737 --> 04:33.373
Balki, these are not
refreshments.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.809
This is wine to be sold.

04:35.842 --> 04:40.446
And it’s estimated
to be worth over $20,000!

04:40.480 --> 04:43.617
[scoffs]
You know, a person would have
to be out of his mind

04:43.650 --> 04:47.053
to pay $20,000
for a bottle of wine.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.455
Well, it still makes more sense
than bottled water.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.761
I mean, that is a concept
I will never understand.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.065
We are about to begin.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.434
Please take your seats.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.970
I’d like to help,
but my hands are tied.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.572
[Balki laughing]

05:09.610 --> 05:10.644
The first item to be auctioned

05:10.677 --> 05:15.115
is this bottle of Chateau Lafite
wine, vintage 1811.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.083
Get out of the city!

05:18.819 --> 05:22.889
‐We buy our wine at 7‐11.
‐Shut up!

05:22.923 --> 05:25.826
‐Cousin, I‐I‐I was wanting‐‐
‐Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

05:25.859 --> 05:27.894
Or you’ll have to wait
in the car.

05:27.928 --> 05:28.995
I’ll be good.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.700
The minimum bid
on this item is $11,000.

05:35.401 --> 05:38.004
Would anyone care
to open the bidding?

05:38.038 --> 05:41.074
’Eleven thousand.
Do I have twelve?’

05:41.107 --> 05:43.977
Twelve thousand dollars.
Do I hear thirteen?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.479
Cousin,
why is he pointing at people?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.515
It’s a bit confrontational,
don’t you think?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.918
No, Balki,
those people are bidding.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.087
They are not bidding,
not one of them

05:54.120 --> 05:55.856
has thrown a pig in the air.

05:57.924 --> 06:02.028
No, Balki, bidding here is a
little different than on Mypos.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.765
These people are bidding by
making small, little gestures.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.034
Here, watch the man
in the red tie.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.537
(male #1)
’Fourteen thousand five hundred.
Do I have fifteen?’

06:10.571 --> 06:12.405
Did you see him bid?

06:12.438 --> 06:16.476
No, I‐I just saw him
flick his nose like that.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.978
Fifteen thousand.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.581
Do I have fifteen five?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.616
You see, every little gesture

06:22.649 --> 06:24.885
tells the auctioneer
that you are bidding.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.820
See, the woman in the blue dress

06:26.853 --> 06:29.422
is bidding by tugging
on her ear, like this.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.557
Fifteen thousand five hundred!

06:30.591 --> 06:31.992
Do I have sixteen?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.095
Yeah, I’m sort of an expert
in this area.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.766
I once used the men’s room
at Sotheby’s.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.038
(male #1)
’Sixteen thousand.
Do I have sixteen five?’

06:45.071 --> 06:48.575
There are as many ways to bid as
there are people in this room.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.176
You could rub your chin.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.745
You mean like this?

06:51.778 --> 06:53.146
Sixteen thousand five hundred.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.716
Do I have seventeen? Seventeen?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.483
Or you could
scratch your head.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.753
Seventeen thousand.
Do I have eighteen?

06:59.786 --> 07:02.155
Or you could make a pig nose.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.124
Eighteen thousand!

07:04.157 --> 07:05.191
’Do I have nineteen?’

07:05.225 --> 07:06.459
‐Balki, don’t.
‐Nineteen, anyone?

07:06.492 --> 07:08.094
Nineteen?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.631
Nineteen thousand.
Do I have twenty?

07:10.664 --> 07:13.700
‐That was close.
‐W‐why can’t I move?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.168
Because when you made
your pig nose

07:15.201 --> 07:17.037
the auctioneer thought
you were bidding.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.773
Oh, come on.
Give me a line of credit.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.044
He thought I was bidding
because I did this?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.212
Twenty thousand! Do I have
twenty‐one thousand?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.814
Don’t do that.
Uh, excuse me!

07:27.848 --> 07:29.583
Twenty‐one thousand!

07:30.717 --> 07:33.987
Going once, going twice...

07:34.020 --> 07:36.857
Sold for twenty‐one thousand
to the man in the blue tie.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.927
Oh, my Lord!

07:40.961 --> 07:42.896
[instrumental music]

07:47.768 --> 07:49.736
Cousin, just, just don’t move.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.104
Okay, just hold on a second.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.840
Hold on. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.711
Okay, okay,
now, just be, uh, just...

07:57.744 --> 08:00.046
Cousin, cousin, cousin

08:00.080 --> 08:02.215
Come in and walk
on the pillows, okay?

08:02.248 --> 08:04.685
Walk on the pillows.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.186
’Walk on the pillows.’

08:07.821 --> 08:09.089
‐Walk on the what?
‐Walk on the pillows.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.858
[both grunting]

08:15.295 --> 08:17.631
[panting]

08:17.664 --> 08:20.967
Balki, be more careful.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.169
Me be more careful?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.539
I’m the one you made sit
on the hood of the car

08:25.572 --> 08:27.007
waving off oncoming traffic.

08:29.943 --> 08:34.080
I’m sorry,
but I had to protect the wine.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.517
Well, you could have slowed down
when I fell off.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.653
‐I don’t want to argue‐‐
‐Look, cousin...

08:39.686 --> 08:40.520
That always gets you
off the hook.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.121
Thank you very much, alright?
Fine.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.890
What we’re going to do now

08:43.924 --> 08:47.828
is just put the bottle down...

08:47.861 --> 08:51.031
...and find a safe place
to keep it.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.166
You know what, cousin?
On Mypos what we do, we‐‐

08:53.199 --> 08:55.869
Balki, I usually don’t care
what you do on Mypos.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.773
And today, I care even less.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.945
Well, I was just going to say
that on Mypos

09:04.978 --> 09:06.747
we store the bottles
on their sides

09:06.780 --> 09:08.014
so that the cork don’t dry out.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.984
Oh.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.956
W‐we do that here too.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.261
Would you,
would you like to know

09:21.294 --> 09:22.829
what we do
with the sacred straw?

09:22.863 --> 09:23.930
No.

09:30.136 --> 09:34.708
Alright. Now, where
is a good place to keep it?

09:37.143 --> 09:38.879
Cousin! Cousin! Cousin!

09:48.789 --> 09:49.990
[both sigh]

09:50.023 --> 09:51.324
There’s one thing
that really worries me.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.292
What’s that?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.728
I don’t think this table
is completely level.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.296
‐Let’s see.
‐No!

10:04.938 --> 10:07.641
Alright. That’s it.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.644
We are not letting
this bottle out of our hands

10:10.677 --> 10:12.913
until we find a safe place
to put it.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.082
Oh!

10:18.719 --> 10:20.654
Will you stop it?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.658
Don’t do that.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.894
‐Hey!
‐Oh!

10:30.396 --> 10:31.397
You know what we can do?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.333
We can wait till Jennifer
and Mary Anne come home

10:33.366 --> 10:35.401
and maybe they’ll have an idea
where we can put it.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.804
Balki, if Jennifer finds out

10:37.838 --> 10:40.406
I paid $21,000
for a bottle of wine

10:40.440 --> 10:42.809
she will kill me
for being stupid.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.978
If she was going to kill you
for being stupid

10:45.011 --> 10:46.947
you would have been dead
long ago.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.884
[no audio]

10:54.955 --> 10:57.357
What I mean is we are not going
to tell Jennifer

10:57.390 --> 10:59.192
anything about this.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.261
What we have to do
is find a safe place

11:01.294 --> 11:03.163
to hide the wine
for the weekend.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.365
The auction is continuing
on Monday.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.368
We will take the wine back
and resell it.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.072
And you will have successfully
deceived your wife yet again.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.941
Exactly.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.279
Oh, I’ve got it!

11:19.312 --> 11:21.347
We’ll hide the wine
in the liquor cabinet.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.917
Cousin, you are a genius!

11:23.950 --> 11:25.919
‐Ooh!
‐Ooh!

11:25.952 --> 11:28.989
‐Balki! Don’t do that!
‐Cousin, okay.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.193
Alright, just help me get the
wine over to the liquor cabinet.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.327
Okay. Cousin, cousin,
I’m going to cushion your walk.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.361
‐Okay?
‐F‐fine. Fine. Okay.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.462
‐I’m going to cushion it.
‐Alright, here we go.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.832
And everything’s going to be
just honki‐doriki.

11:38.865 --> 11:39.866
Alright, carefully, carefully.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.502
Okay, okay, okay.
Look, right there. See that?

11:41.535 --> 11:44.270
‐Okay. Alright, I got it.
‐Okay. And then right there.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.906
‐Got it. Got it.
‐Okay? I’ve got this one.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.040
I’ve got this one.
I’ve got this one.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.942
‐Okay? And right there.
‐Okay. Fine. Alright, yeah.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.011
‐And then I... Okay?
‐Okay. Okay, good.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.112
‐And then this one right here.
‐We’re doin’ fine.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.213
‐We’re doin’ fine.
‐And...

11:53.246 --> 11:54.314
[yelps]

11:56.049 --> 11:57.518
Alright, alright!
No, no, no!

11:57.551 --> 11:59.419
Okay, okay, you walk,
I’ll move the pillows, okay?

11:59.452 --> 12:00.486
‐’Okay.’
‐One foot at a time.

12:00.521 --> 12:01.888
‐Okay.
‐One foot, here we go.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.189
‐Take a step. Take a step.
‐Okay. Alright.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.758
‐Alright, alright. Okay.
‐I’ll move the pillows.

12:04.791 --> 12:05.826
Take‐take it easy. Take it easy.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.894
’There you go. Come on.
Come on, next foot.’

12:07.928 --> 12:10.030
Next foot. Good! Good!
Alright. Alright.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.197
I got you, I got you!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.766
‐Go ahead! One more...
‐Yeah. Oh!

12:12.799 --> 12:14.500
‐Careful! Careful!
‐Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:14.535 --> 12:16.336
‐Next step. You got it.
‐’Okay. Okay.’

12:16.369 --> 12:18.271
‐Okay, okay, fine.
‐Alright, alright.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.974
‐Oh, oh, oh.
‐Careful! Careful!

12:21.007 --> 12:22.509
‐Okay, here we go. Alright.
‐Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:22.543 --> 12:23.777
‐Alright. Move back.
‐Okay.

12:23.810 --> 12:24.878
‐Move back. Here we go.
‐Okay.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.012
‐Okay.
‐Okay, alright.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.848
‐Oh. Ah!
‐Okay. Alright.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.850
Where’s the wine?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.184
Right over there.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.219
‐It’s right here. Here.
‐No! Oh!

12:36.923 --> 12:38.458
(both)
Don’t do that.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.496
‐Okay, here, hold this.
‐Um, alright.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.532
No one ever goes
in the liquor cabinet.

12:45.566 --> 12:47.300
The only thing in here
is an old bottle

12:47.333 --> 12:49.069
of Creme de Menthe
my brother Billy gave me

12:49.102 --> 12:50.537
for a wedding present.

12:50.571 --> 12:52.338
You know, this still steams me.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.439
No thought went into this gift.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.308
[panting]

12:55.341 --> 12:57.377
It’s the same bottle
I gave him for his birthday.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.315
Alright, give me the wine.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.117
‐Where’s the wine?
‐Right here.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.352
[grunting]

13:06.386 --> 13:07.921
(both)
Don’t do that.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.524
I‐I...
There’s hair here, you know.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.492
Not any more.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.064
Alright, now...

13:21.201 --> 13:25.839
We’ll just hide the key
...right here.

13:25.872 --> 13:26.873
[key clanks]

13:28.241 --> 13:30.243
It would take a psychic
to find that key.

13:30.276 --> 13:31.377
Well, when he gets here

13:31.411 --> 13:34.447
maybe he can tell us
who is going to be chosen queen

13:34.480 --> 13:36.883
of this year’s
Mypos Fertilizer Festival.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.887
Mypos Fertilizer Festival?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.055
Yes, it’s next week.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.926
Mama runs the cow patty fling...

13:45.959 --> 13:48.929
...and, uh, traditionally
the whole island then plays

13:48.962 --> 13:50.496
Pin The Fly On The Dungheap.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.935
[instrumental music]

13:54.968 --> 13:56.903
[thunder rumbling]

14:06.212 --> 14:08.615
That was a good idea
you had about these raincoats.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.551
You know, we should wear them
every time it rains.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.221
Okay.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.623
Uh, you know,
the boys will be home soon.

14:16.657 --> 14:18.391
We’d better get dinner started.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.996
Oh, I hope Balki
likes the beef burgundy dinner

14:23.029 --> 14:24.330
I’m making tonight.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.932
Well, you know what they say,
Mary Anne.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.935
"The way to a man’s heart
is through his stomach."

14:28.969 --> 14:30.070
I don’t know about that.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.471
My uncle had a triple bypass

14:31.505 --> 14:33.239
and they went right
through his chest.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.213
Were you ever on a flight
where they lost cabin pressure?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.017
Oh, lots of times.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.453
Oh, I forgot to get the wine!

14:47.487 --> 14:49.355
We’re gonna have to go back
out in the rain.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.291
Oh, maybe not, uh,
Larry’s brother, Billy

14:51.324 --> 14:53.326
gave us a bottle of something
for our wedding.

14:59.533 --> 15:02.235
Well, that’s funny,
the liquor cabinet is locked

15:02.268 --> 15:04.004
and I have no idea
where the key is.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.447
How did you know where it was?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.949
I don’t know.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.520
Sometimes these things
just come to me.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.292
I also know that someone
named Machdala

15:26.326 --> 15:28.094
is going to be crowned
queen of something

15:28.128 --> 15:30.230
called the Fertilizer Festival.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.704
Ah! We’re in luck! We don’t have
to go back out in the rain.

15:37.738 --> 15:41.041
Wow, this wine is really old!

15:41.074 --> 15:42.342
I hope it’s still good enough
to cook with!

15:43.710 --> 15:46.446
[instrumental music]

15:51.084 --> 15:53.219
[instrumental music]

15:59.392 --> 16:01.227
‐Mmm.
‐Mmm!

16:07.433 --> 16:09.770
Mary Anne, this is the best food
I’ve ever had

16:09.803 --> 16:11.304
without pig parts.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.741
Thank you, Balki.

16:14.775 --> 16:16.376
Balki’s right,
it tastes great.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.011
Less filling.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.082
What exactly is in it?

16:22.115 --> 16:24.317
Oh, it’s just beef simmered
in a red wine sauce.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.519
‐Oh!
‐Mmm.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.020
It was almost
just simmered beef.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.022
We forgot to buy the wine.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.324
[both chuckle]

16:31.357 --> 16:33.093
But we looked around
and found some.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.033
[both screaming]

16:45.772 --> 16:47.107
You were right. Too much pepper.

16:49.810 --> 16:52.245
Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin,
it’s okay. Everything’s okay.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.614
The cabinet is still locked.

16:53.647 --> 16:55.682
[panting]

16:55.716 --> 16:58.519
Larry, why do you have
the liquor cabinet locked?

16:59.820 --> 17:01.822
The only thing in there
is some Creme de Menthe

17:01.855 --> 17:03.323
and an old bottle of wine.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.657
You found the wine?

17:04.691 --> 17:05.726
(both)
They found the wine!

17:05.759 --> 17:08.127
(both)
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:08.161 --> 17:10.664
Mary Anne, how could you cook

17:10.696 --> 17:12.799
with a bottle of wine
from the liquor cabinet?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.269
This is all your fault!

17:16.301 --> 17:19.138
How could you let me hide
the wine in the liquor cabinet?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.840
Excuse me, it was your idea

17:20.874 --> 17:23.143
to hide the wine
in the liquor cabinet!

17:24.810 --> 17:26.713
And it was also your idea
to put the key in the vase!

17:26.747 --> 17:29.149
I never should have let you go
to the auction to begin with.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.651
You are nothing but trouble.

17:30.684 --> 17:33.286
Oh, is that right, Mr. Mayor
of the Munchkin City?

17:33.319 --> 17:35.421
We welcome you to Munchkinland.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.792
Guys. She didn’t cook
with the wine.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.193
(both)
Oh!

17:40.226 --> 17:42.629
I’m sorry about
the "Wizard Of Oz" thing.

17:42.663 --> 17:44.731
We couldn’t find a corkscrew
so we went next door

17:44.765 --> 17:46.800
and borrowed some wine
from the Finleys.

17:46.833 --> 17:51.104
Why are you acting so crazy
over an old bottle of wine?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.674
W‐well, uh, Jen,
i‐i‐it’s simple.

17:53.707 --> 17:57.410
Uh...w‐w‐we went to an auction,
Balki made a pig nose

17:57.443 --> 18:00.146
and I bought a bottle of wine
for $21,000.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.515
[gasps]

18:01.548 --> 18:03.083
Okay.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.890
But I admit
we did something stupid

18:09.923 --> 18:10.924
but everything
is going to be okay.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.193
‐Excuse me, excuse me.
‐I promise, I promise‐‐

18:13.226 --> 18:14.427
We did something stupid?

18:16.496 --> 18:20.266
I believe I had the intelligence
to stop bidding at $20,000.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.138
Twenty thousand dollars?

18:25.171 --> 18:26.306
Mm‐hmm.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.276
[instrumental music]

18:32.546 --> 18:33.747
(male #1)
’Forty thousand dollars.’

18:33.780 --> 18:36.783
Going once, going twice...

18:36.817 --> 18:39.753
Sold for $40,000.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.654
Did you hear that, Balki?

18:40.687 --> 18:42.623
Forty thousand dollars
for a necklace.

18:42.656 --> 18:44.257
What a waste of money.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.792
Well, you could say that again.

18:45.826 --> 18:47.360
They could have bought
two bottles

18:47.393 --> 18:49.129
of your wine
for that much money.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.300
Our next item
is this very fine bottle

18:54.334 --> 18:57.871
of 1811 Chateau Lefite Bordeaux.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.642
We are asking an opening bid
of $11,000.

19:01.675 --> 19:03.476
We have got to get $21,000

19:03.510 --> 19:05.546
for this bottle of wine
or I am a dead man.

19:06.780 --> 19:09.349
Cousin, Jennifer won’t kill you.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.917
She’ll leave you,
but she won’t kill you.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.288
I have eleven thousand.
Do I have twelve?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.423
’Do I have
twelve thousand dollars?’

19:17.457 --> 19:20.326
’Twelve? Do I have twelve?’

19:20.360 --> 19:21.895
Twelve thousand.
Is there thirteen?

19:23.463 --> 19:25.198
Thirteen thousand.
Is there fourteen?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.370
Balki, this isn’t going
as well as I thought.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.639
I’m going to
have to do something.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.776
Fourteen thousand.
Is there fifteen?

19:35.809 --> 19:38.444
Cousin, what are you doing?
Y‐you’re bidding on the wine?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.246
You already own the wine!

19:40.280 --> 19:42.583
Balki, there’s only one
other person bidding.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.384
I’m just trying to get
the price up to $21,000

19:44.417 --> 19:46.419
so I don’t lose any money.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.288
Fifteen thousand.
Do I hear sixteen?

19:48.321 --> 19:49.455
Sixteen thousand.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.991
Seventeen.
Is there eighteen?

19:51.024 --> 19:53.493
Eighteen. Nineteen anyone?

19:53.527 --> 19:55.395
Nineteen.
Do I have twenty thou...

19:55.428 --> 19:57.397
’Twenty thousand dollars.’

19:57.430 --> 19:59.800
‐’Twenty‐one thousand dollars.’
‐Yes! Yes!

19:59.833 --> 20:02.335
Do I hear twenty‐two?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.304
’Twenty‐two thousand dollars!’

20:04.337 --> 20:05.371
’Do I hear twenty‐three?’

20:05.405 --> 20:06.439
Balki, what are you doing?

20:06.472 --> 20:08.008
Well, I just kind of
got caught up

20:08.041 --> 20:09.776
in the excitement of the moment.

20:09.810 --> 20:10.877
Well, don’t move.

20:10.911 --> 20:14.447
‐Excuse me.
‐I have twenty‐three!

20:14.480 --> 20:16.683
‐Do I have twenty‐four?
‐No, no.

20:16.717 --> 20:17.784
’The bidding stands at
twenty‐three thousand...’

20:17.818 --> 20:19.019
Balki, he stopped bidding.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.922
Cousin, maybe he doesn’t
want it, maybe we’ll get it!

20:23.624 --> 20:24.625
[grunting]

20:26.026 --> 20:28.595
I have $23,000.

20:28.629 --> 20:30.430
Are there any further bids?

20:30.463 --> 20:31.965
What have you done?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.568
Cousin, if you’d just let
the oxygen get to my brain

20:34.601 --> 20:36.803
I think I can help your problem.

20:36.837 --> 20:38.672
Twenty‐three thousand,
going once.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.607
Twenty‐three thousand,
going twice.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.044
Twenty‐four thousand!

20:44.077 --> 20:45.946
’Twenty‐four thousand.
Do I hear twenty‐five?’

20:47.380 --> 20:48.682
Do I hear twenty‐five?

20:48.715 --> 20:49.883
Oh, no, no.
Excuse me, I wasn’t‐‐

20:49.916 --> 20:52.352
Oh, Leo.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.420
For me.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.022
[chuckles]
Well...

20:56.056 --> 20:59.325
‐Of course, my dear.
‐’Twenty‐four thousand.’

20:59.359 --> 21:01.828
Alright, Balki,
stay very, very still.

21:01.862 --> 21:05.732
Twenty‐four thousand
going once, going twice...

21:05.766 --> 21:07.868
Sold for $24,000.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.736
Yes! Yes!

21:12.072 --> 21:15.809
Our next item is this
17th century snuff box.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.078
‐Cousin, can I move now?
‐Yes.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.715
Shall we open the bidding
at thirty‐two thousand?

21:21.748 --> 21:24.551
Thirty‐two thousand.
Thirty‐three thousand!

21:24.585 --> 21:27.020
Thirty‐four,
thirty‐five...

21:27.053 --> 21:28.589
Thirty‐six thousand!

21:28.622 --> 21:30.023
Thirty‐seven thousand dollars!

21:30.056 --> 21:31.658
Thirty‐eight thous...

21:31.692 --> 21:33.326
Thirty‐nine thousand...

21:33.359 --> 21:34.427
Forty‐thousand dollars!

21:34.460 --> 21:35.996
[instrumental music]

21:43.970 --> 21:45.405
How’d it go, Larry?

21:45.438 --> 21:50.410
Well, we sold the wine
for $24,000.

21:51.545 --> 21:54.648
But you only paid $21,000.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.617
That means you made...

21:59.853 --> 22:01.688
...a lot of money!

22:03.524 --> 22:05.892
Well, we had to pay some,
uh, hidden costs in commissions

22:05.926 --> 22:08.562
so we really didn’t end up
with very much.

22:08.595 --> 22:12.332
And Balki saw something
he couldn’t live without.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.711
[instrumental music]

22:34.187 --> 22:36.857
[theme music]
