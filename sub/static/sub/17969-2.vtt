WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:11.485
Did he infect us?

00:11.678 --> 00:12.816
Are we going to die?

00:14.281 --> 00:16.727
I'm not sure what happened.

00:16.884 --> 00:20.832
Suddenly, Peter, Dr. Farragut,
was on top of me.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.630
He held me down, put his mouth
over mine, like some kind of animal.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.801
I've never felt so violated.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.213
I was choking.
Couldn't bloody breathe.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.713
Like he was trying to smother me.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.247
What about the others?

00:41.241 --> 00:42.413
What others?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.384
There were three more
in here with us.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.855
After the attack, they ran.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.152
Where?

00:50.350 --> 00:52.694
I don't know.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.761
I need their names.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.099
<i>Attention, Code 425, Level R.</i>

01:01.261 --> 01:02.899
We have a containment issue.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.943
I heard. I've asked Hatake for a security
team. We're mounting a search.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.377
This place is huge. If we can't maintain
a simple isolation protocol...

01:10.537 --> 01:12.744
There's nothing simple about this.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.113
All right, let's
concentrate on what we do know.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.586
We know the virus is not airborne.
What are the victims saying?

01:18.745 --> 01:21.783
They're saying that Peter
engaged in some kind of oral contact.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.024
What, like a kiss or a bite?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.121
More like an assault.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.861
The R-nought of the virus
is now six.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.197
Multiply that limes our escapees...

01:32.359 --> 01:35.465
That's 18 new cases
we can look forward to.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.200
We're not even sure Peter's done yet.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.977
Jules, I need you to get started
on the rats right away.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.118
We need to find out
the rate of infection.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.653
Sarah, can you handle the Isolation unit
until Doreen checks in?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.415
Yeah, absolutely.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.422
You see any signs
of viral syndrome...

01:54.581 --> 01:57.619
Fever, sweats, rash, sore throat,
nausea, vomiting,

01:57.784 --> 02:00.924
myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy.
Any of that.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.399
...You get back into a Racal suit
and you find me immediately.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.938
Dr. Farragut.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.669
Our three missing doctors,
Tracey, Raver and DeKlerk,

02:12.833 --> 02:15.404
no one has seen them
since they fled the sunroom.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.344
Why does that not surprise me?

02:17.504 --> 02:20.917
Can you tell me if anyone's tried to
leave the base the last eight hours?

02:21.341 --> 02:22.615
No.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.653
We have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.588
Major Balleseros and myself
will go floor to floor, room by room.

02:28.749 --> 02:32.822
And if they refuse to cooperate?
Like your brother?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.523
Let's not forget he's still out there.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.829
- I'll have to persuade them.
- I hope you can.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.872
But just in case, our security teams
will carry stun batons and restraints.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.703
Try to win them over with force?

02:44.865 --> 02:47.607
The safety of this base
is my only concern.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.612
I don't agree with restraining people
any more than you do,

02:50.771 --> 02:53.615
but let's just find them first,

02:53.774 --> 02:57.187
see if we can convince them
to do what's best for the whole base.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.060
You need help
with those escaped patients.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.992
Not as much as I need you in the lab.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.326
Rate of infection
is secondary to containment.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.661
I've tracked infected patients
the past two years.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.202
I can talk to them.
It's not about qualifications.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.863
Then what is it about?
Our lack of resources up here.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.033
That's bullshit. When was the last time
you even left Atlanta?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.737
Damn it, we cannot both be in charge.
You'll have to follow my lead on this.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.146
How long do we have to be in here?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.679
Couple of weeks at most.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.114
A couple of weeks?
What about my research?

05:40.273 --> 05:42.446
What if I'm not infected?
I'm in the same room.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.952
Breathing the air...
Shut up.

05:44.110 --> 05:47.523
Everybody, please calm down.
I know this is very stressful.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.025
You don't know anything.
How old are you?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.024
I'm 26.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.823
You look like you're 15.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.525
I have two master's, a PhD from MIT
specializing in virology and biogenetics.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.967
The youngest doctor
hired by CDC in a decade,

06:00.126 --> 06:03.471
and Dr. Farragut put me in charge
of Isolation because I'm qualified.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.541
I will do my best
to address your needs,

06:05.699 --> 06:08.578
but I wanna make one thing
we will have order here.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.488
We'll start with Dr. Tracey's room.

06:16.643 --> 06:21.490
I'll breach the door and enter first.
Don't follow until you hear the all-clear.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.017
What's that?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.559
Stun baton.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.062
Use them on polar bears.
Non-lethal, pack a wallop.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.393
Ought to come in handy
if we run into any bears.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.729
We run into Peter,
you'll be glad we have these.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.929
He tore off a man's head.
A shock will stop him?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.195
You got a better idea?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.672
Yeah, I do.
No breaching, no batons.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.938
We knock on the door. If Dr. Tracey's
home, we have a conversation.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.945
And if she's in no mood to converse?

06:44.437 --> 06:46.576
I've grown kind of fond of my hands.

06:53.613 --> 06:54.853
Dr. Tracey?

06:56.249 --> 06:59.594
Dr. Tracey,
it's Alan Farragut with the CDC.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.565
These are from the sunroom.
She was here.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.264
But she didn't want to be.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.712
She was trying to get out.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.408
Then where the hell did she go?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.961
Who are you?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.932
Doreen Boyle.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.641
How do I know that's your real name?

07:49.903 --> 07:51.814
It says it on my driver's license.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.681
I got my real weight on there too
but I'm not telling you that.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.117
Who sent you here?

08:00.313 --> 08:04.591
I work for the CDC.
I study infectious diseases.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.497
Maybe you can help me...
Don't you come near us! You hear me?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.534
"Us"? Who are you talking to?

08:14.027 --> 08:17.167
You're messing with my head.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.106
You need a doctor.
I am a doctor.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.769
That's why I'm here.
To take you to Isolation...

08:22.936 --> 08:27.009
No, no, no. Not there.
They do terrible things to you.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.277
No, I can't tell you.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.149
They'll take me to the White Room
like Dr. Hvit.

08:31.311 --> 08:36.056
I want off this base. You get me
on the helicopter. You promise me?

08:38.150 --> 08:41.360
I'll even get you to sit shotgun.

08:42.554 --> 08:43.625
Come on, I'll go with you.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.166
Why...?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.896
Why would you lie to us?

08:50.530 --> 08:54.205
There is no helicopter here.
No, not now, but I can make a call.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.507
You are a dirty, filthy liar.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.681
Now, what are we gonna
do with you?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.831
Are you all right?

09:21.761 --> 09:23.206
Yeah.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.043
I thought I heard something.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.705
I keep thinking about Peter up there.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.506
It's just the base settling.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.844
Have you slept
since you arrived?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.783
Uh, an hour or two.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.048
I'm fine, really.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.886
Sleep in the Arctic is critical.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.790
The mind can play tricks.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.032
I'll take that under advisement.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.734
Wait. What just happened?

09:59.365 --> 10:00.435
Did you see that?

10:00.633 --> 10:01.941
Yes.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.285
What was going on in that lab?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.088
I told you.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.155
Peter was researching mutagens.

10:13.813 --> 10:16.726
I think we both know
that was no mutagen.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.260
What was he really working on?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.905
You got to let us out of here.
This is kidnapping. I demand a lawyer.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.569
This is a public health crisis.
The CDC has full jurisdiction.

10:35.735 --> 10:39.148
Hell of a lot of good that's done. We'd
do a better job of finding a cure.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.080
Give it a rest.
You give it a rest.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.347
You're not the one who shared a
bathroom with Typhoid Mary over there.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.920
I'm sorry. Try to keep still.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.823
Or what? I'll get sick and die? Heh.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.158
Must be bad.
You've put the suit back on.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.459
We don't know exactly
what we're dealing with.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.931
Everything could be fine.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.330
Not knowing
is why things can't be fine.

11:02.495 --> 11:07.035
Not knowing is why those two over there
are gonna turn on me.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.774
It's just a matter of time.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.843
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.645
I promise.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.016
That's a promise
you don't wanna make.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.454
Do you have
morphine sulphate here?

11:26.886 --> 11:29.127
He needs morphine now.
Where do I get it?

11:29.289 --> 11:32.065
Level G, drug stockroom.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.687
Get up.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.053
Who is it?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.365
A runner from the sunroom.
Hiding in the stairwell.

12:01.521 --> 12:05.697
That's Dr. DeKlerk from the Aerosol
Division. You didn't have to be so rough.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.258
Maybe if you followed directions...

12:07.427 --> 12:09.373
Maybe if you told us what was going on.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.366
Oh, oh.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.703
What's wrong with him?

12:13.866 --> 12:16.938
Is he infected?
We don't know. What's his name?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.383
I told you. DeKlerk.
His first name.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.350
Henrik, I think.

12:21.541 --> 12:25.079
Henrik, we're with you.
We're with you. We'll take care of you.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.088
He's still breathing.
Get him to sickbay.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.628
Show's over. Everyone
go back to your rooms.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.196
Not until you tell us
why we haven't been evacuated.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.206
Don't breathe.

12:43.062 --> 12:46.305
Keep him away from me.
You didn't answer my question.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.640
We're doing the best we can.
That's bullshit.

12:49.802 --> 12:53.272
You're from the CDC. You could get us
out of here if you really wanted to.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.420
You know what?
You're right. You're right.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.750
We could evacuate you all,
airlift you out to the nearest hospital,

12:59.912 --> 13:01.721
and you know
what would happen then?

13:01.881 --> 13:05.988
It would start with the doctors
and the nurses. The ones caring for you.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.827
They'd go home to their families, kiss
their kids good night, pass on the virus.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.397
The next day at school,
those kids would infect others,

13:13.559 --> 13:17.063
and in two weeks' time,
this virus is in the general population.

13:17.230 --> 13:21.645
In four weeks,
every major city on this planet.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.575
So, no,

13:27.440 --> 13:29.420
we're not evacuating you.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.920
But we're not abandoning you.

13:33.946 --> 13:38.520
We will stay with you
as long as it takes to figure this out.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.430
Now, please,
just go back to your rooms.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.103
This is madness.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.832
Nice speech.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.440
I haven't heard that since Kikwit, '95?

13:59.272 --> 14:01.274
It was Joburg, '96.
What are you doing here?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.888
There was something strange
going on in Peter's lab.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.026
Been combing tapes...
I asked you to work on rate of infection.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.617
This seemed important.
I made this clear...

14:11.784 --> 14:13.320
What's going on, Alan?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.523
You were always stubborn,
but you made sense.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.895
We talked about this...
Is this about Peter?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.293
That's absurd.
Are you punishing me?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.963
Believe me, I've punished myself
enough for both of us.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.336
This is not the time,
it's not the place...

14:25.498 --> 14:29.537
It was never the time or the place.
That was the problem to begin with.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.839
Jules.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.522
You're here for...

15:18.918 --> 15:20.056
What?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.927
You're here for a reason.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.571
Yeah, I'm with the CDC.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.367
We're here to help you.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.374
No. Not you.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.540
Walker.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.053
Got something here.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.847
Injection logs
for the last three months.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.593
Here's the date
that matches the surveillance tape.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.962
February 19th. Lot 14.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.663
He injected 0.2 ccs of NARVIK-A.

16:02.829 --> 16:08.074
Lot 15, 0.2 ccs of NARVIK-B.
What is that?

16:08.234 --> 16:11.443
I encourage my staff
to push the envelope,

16:11.604 --> 16:13.914
to try new and untested formulas.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.462
Was Peter experimenting with this?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.927
Not that I was aware of.

16:33.192 --> 16:37.663
Who else worked in this lab with him?
You met both of them yesterday.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.104
In body bags.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.785
We need to replicate the test.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.890
Peter's research.
We can examine the results ourselves.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.191
Inject more rats?

16:56.382 --> 16:58.362
And see what happens.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.304
I should've known. They were never
gonna use it for something good.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.999
Move a few genes here and there,
activate the replication cycle.

17:12.164 --> 17:15.737
Bingo, you got yourself the perfect
weapon. It wasn't my fault, right?

17:15.902 --> 17:18.178
How was I supposed to know
it would go sideways?

17:18.337 --> 17:21.910
You can't make a virus and expect it
to follow instructions, right?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.912
Don't play dumb.
You're not fooling anyone.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.556
You knew what you were doing.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.158
I am not taking the fall for this alone,
you hear me?

17:40.259 --> 17:43.240
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.270
What's wrong with me?

17:52.271 --> 17:53.909
Sarah.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.615
Are you all right?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.917
Not really.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.855
Did he touch you?
Make any kind of contact?

18:03.015 --> 18:07.760
Did he get any secretions on you?
No, I'm okay. He didn't attack me.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.120
A lot of empty
vials and syringes over here.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.634
Morphine sulphate.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.267
He's in pain.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.035
Excuse me? This is good.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.472
If he knows to self-medicate,

18:20.633 --> 18:22.977
maybe we can talk him into
coming back to Isolation.

18:23.135 --> 18:26.947
Before he infects anyone else.
I don't know.

18:28.107 --> 18:32.385
He had this look in his eyes.
It wasn't... It wasn't quite human.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.216
What else did he do?

18:34.380 --> 18:37.088
You mean aside from climbing this cage
like Spider-Man?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.097
He said something.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.129
He said, "You're here for a reason."

18:43.155 --> 18:45.601
Only not me, he said, "Walker."
Jules?

18:51.330 --> 18:53.901
I think he left us a trail to follow.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.136
I'll get a security team.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.513
I'm going with you.

18:58.671 --> 19:02.642
Not this time, doc. Things are getting
out of hand, we can't afford to lose you.

19:02.808 --> 19:07.314
But I'll tell you what, though.
How about you be my wingman?

19:16.756 --> 19:19.327
Now I know what
a TV dinner feels like.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.335
I didn't think you'd remember
that one.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.704
Die <i>Hard?</i> Sure, saw it in third grade.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.641
You see anything up there yet?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.454
How do we even know
he's still up here?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.181
If I know Peter, he's still up there.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.706
What makes you so sure?

19:42.381 --> 19:45.362
He used to hide in the
attic when we were kids,

19:45.518 --> 19:48.795
when our dad
was drinking or angry,

19:49.355 --> 19:51.232
which was a lot.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.233
Keep chatter down.
Don't wanna scare him.

19:53.392 --> 19:56.635
No offense, but I don't think
he's the one who's scared.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.882
Will you look up?
I can't see anything.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.917
- Join the club.
- What was that?

20:14.146 --> 20:15.181
What was what?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.696
Tilt your head up about 20 degrees.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.059
Now look left.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.567
It's dark up here. Get it?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.834
Check your six.
Make sure he's not behind you.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.006
Holy shit!

20:38.938 --> 20:40.076
Balleseros.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.109
- Is he all right?
- I'm not sure.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.746
Is he infected?

21:19.145 --> 21:21.887
Well, he's still breathing,
none of that black shit on him.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.958
His pulse is steady.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.566
What happened up there?

21:35.895 --> 21:37.670
Hell if I know.

21:37.830 --> 21:41.778
One minute I was alone, the next minute,
I'm getting a face full of your brother.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.275
I must have nailed us both
with that bug zapper.

21:45.437 --> 21:48.907
That stun baton packs 600 kilovolts.
It should have knocked him out cold.

21:49.074 --> 21:52.351
Seems a lot of things that should be
happening with Peter aren't.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.683
Base 1.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.991
Okay, we're on our way.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.995
Elevator alarm just went off upstairs.
Someone's trying to leave the base.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.129
NARVIK-A subjects are decimated.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.498
Close to a hundred percent
mortality rate.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.106
And NARVIK-B?

22:10.262 --> 22:14.005
Morbidity at a hundred percent,
but mortality at 0.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.170
They're infected, but still alive.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.612
It's been a long time
since I did real lab work.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.652
Guess you forget how tedious it can be.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.824
No, I miss it.

22:26.979 --> 22:31.325
The precision, commitment, sacrifice,

22:31.483 --> 22:34.896
all leading to the joy of discovery.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.729
My mother used to say
something just like that.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.704
She was also a scientist?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.743
Cellular biologist, yeah.

22:48.567 --> 22:51.047
She died when I was very young.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.910
I am sorry.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.079
What about your father?

23:06.719 --> 23:07.754
Oh, my God.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.214
Can't you make him stop?

23:24.403 --> 23:25.575
Morphine isn't working.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.947
If I give him any more, I might kill him.
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.748
Nice. I suppose you'd feel
the same way if it was you?

23:31.911 --> 23:34.187
I feel sorry for Haven,
but those are the breaks.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.519
Everybody, please.
We just need to be patient.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.218
Easy for you to say in that suit.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.591
A precaution
until we figure out a treatment.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.426
You're not figuring out a treatment.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.228
I don't think you know a thing
about this virus.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.302
Stop it. Stop.

23:48.627 --> 23:50.971
We're all doctors here, right?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.711
Instead of bickering,
let's put our heads together.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.610
Yeah, let's get her to let us out of here.

23:58.804 --> 24:02.115
You know I can't do that. You could
infect others or become violent...

24:02.274 --> 24:04.811
And what if someone
gets violent inside this box, huh?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.150
What are we supposed to do then?

24:08.314 --> 24:09.987
Open the door.

24:10.215 --> 24:13.287
At least let us go back to our labs.
No.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.969
Do what you want,
but I'm not letting you out of here.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.003
Then you're gonna
call someone who will.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.902
Base 1.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.115
Okay. We have to go back.
Why?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.751
A couple of detainees
are demanding to be let loose.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.750
They're holding Dr. Jordan.

24:37.676 --> 24:41.681
Go. I'll check outside,
secure the perimeter.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.491
<i>Security
teams, confirm level lockdown.</i>

24:49.688 --> 24:51.668
Release Dr. Jordan at once.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.165
Then we can talk.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.532
Let us out and she comes with us.
No harm done.

24:55.694 --> 24:58.834
If you let us go back to our labs,
we can help with the virus.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.342
Bryce is a hematologist.
I'm a biochemist.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.673
You are in Isolation
for your own safety.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.678
Rats in a box.
We're not gonna die here.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.148
We are working
on an antiviral therapy.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.651
As soon as we run animal trials...

25:10.809 --> 25:12.482
Animal trials could take weeks.

25:12.644 --> 25:15.318
We're not going to be around
that long and you know it.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.628
Dr. Farragut.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.865
I need you to let Dr. Jordan go.
Don't come any closer.

25:28.027 --> 25:32.066
Look, we're working as hard as we can
to figure this thing out,

25:32.231 --> 25:33.710
and we won't stop until we do.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.572
We both know that's a crock of shit.

25:35.734 --> 25:39.079
Hear him out, Bryce.
Listen, I'm in here with you,

25:39.238 --> 25:40.546
not out there.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.879
We will work this out. All right?

25:43.042 --> 25:47.081
Just give me the syringe
and let Dr. Jordan go.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.419
Why should we trust you?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.002
Dr. Farragut.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.683
Now we're in this together.

26:26.885 --> 26:29.525
Alan, what you did back there...

26:34.960 --> 26:36.633
Thank you.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.867
I was just doing my job.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.138
And so were you
by not letting them leave.

26:43.302 --> 26:47.648
I had a good teacher.
Yeah? Do I know him?

26:49.641 --> 26:54.090
It was low-risk anyway, what with
the lack of airborne transmission.

26:56.381 --> 26:57.985
Jules, what is it?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.422
I need to show you something.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.495
The NARVIK-A subjects died horribly,

27:04.656 --> 27:06.567
lesions, hemorrhagic shock,

27:06.758 --> 27:08.897
liquification of internal organs.

27:09.061 --> 27:14.170
But the NARVIK-B subjects didn't die.
They became highly aggressive, agitated.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.177
Sounds like a lyssavirus.
Maybe some form of rabies?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.976
Rabies doesn't include a compulsion
to spread contagion.

27:20.405 --> 27:25.013
I've never seen a pathogen
with such focused behavioral patterns.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.248
The B samples
are acting just like vectors.

27:27.412 --> 27:28.914
Vectors on steroids.

27:29.081 --> 27:34.656
I think the B virus rewires the brain
to create a perfect contagion machine.

27:38.123 --> 27:39.602
Like Peter.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.331
Dr. Farragut?
Dr. Hatake would like a word with you.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.304
And I'd like a word with him.

27:47.099 --> 27:50.342
Get down to Isolation.
Check on the infected patients.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.175
If what you've discovered is true,

27:52.337 --> 27:55.318
we're not just dealing with
a single virus anymore.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.693
Going for a spin?

28:06.618 --> 28:09.155
It's a brisk night.
I hope you brought your woolies.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.802
This doesn't have
anything to do with you.

28:12.958 --> 28:15.996
Still, I'm gonna have to ask you
to return back to the base.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.735
If you had any idea
what they were doing here,

28:18.897 --> 28:20.968
you'd be getting the hell out yourself.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.909
The transgenic experiments,
the virus vaults.

28:25.137 --> 28:28.880
Unregulated research sounds great
until you're actually doing it.

28:29.341 --> 28:34.154
What they did to those monkeys
was an abomination.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.393
Come back inside.
I wanna hear about this.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.993
I'm not going back.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.761
Come back inside.
You're gonna freeze out here.

28:42.921 --> 28:45.197
People have to know
what's going on up here.

28:45.357 --> 28:48.930
We have to tell the newspapers.
Hell, we have to tell everyone.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.094
You Okay?

29:13.252 --> 29:15.061
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.758
You don't have to go back
in there right now. I can handle it.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.267
I'm good, thanks.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.874
A little help?

29:25.063 --> 29:26.406
Meet Dr. Tracey.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.739
She's in advanced stages, but I got her
tranqued up on monkey juice.

29:29.901 --> 29:32.438
Took me a long damn time
to haul her ass up here.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.447
And there's some other
monkey business

29:34.606 --> 29:36.882
I think Dr. Farragut
would like to hear about.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.930
Not bringing her in here, are you?

29:54.092 --> 29:57.403
She's going straight into the ICU
chamber. You won't have any contact.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.303
A little late for that, isn't it?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.743
He's seizing. I need a crash cart.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.112
Got it.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.913
Do it, now.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.751
- No, no, no.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.862
Sorry, love.

30:44.476 --> 30:48.720
This virus was less of a danger
before the CDC arrived.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.726
My people were the ones attacked
in there. Yours were doing the attacking.

30:52.884 --> 30:56.354
I thought you had
that situation under control.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.795
I was mistaken.

30:57.956 --> 31:02.962
And I thought we had the full picture,
not to mention complete access.

31:03.128 --> 31:07.543
Maybe you can tell me how it is
that patients here just go missing,

31:07.699 --> 31:12.170
or how a member of my team
is attacked by an infected monkey

31:12.337 --> 31:15.546
she was told
didn't exist in the first place.

31:16.508 --> 31:21.753
Or maybe you'd like to tell me
why my brother was tinkering

31:21.913 --> 31:25.520
with maybe the worst contagion this
world has seen in his own damn lab?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.891
You should ask your brother.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.996
I would never encourage
something so reckless.

31:38.096 --> 31:39.575
First things first.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.370
How do we contain
the infected patients?

31:43.535 --> 31:47.381
We don't,
not without complete transparency.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.183
And if I refuse?

31:52.344 --> 31:53.379
We came here to help.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.582
You no longer want that help,
that's fine,

31:55.747 --> 31:59.092
but it seems to me
we're the last chance you have.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.754
So,

32:02.220 --> 32:06.191
maybe we give each other
what we want, what we need,

32:06.358 --> 32:09.396
and just maybe
we all get out of here alive.

32:31.650 --> 32:32.720
I'm sorry.

32:32.884 --> 32:36.093
For what? It's not your fault.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.326
I should've been there.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.839
Don't beat yourself up.
We'll get them back.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.747
I didn't keep you off the search
because of Peter. I didn't wanna...

32:54.806 --> 32:57.184
I lost you once.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.829
I appreciate that, I do.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.329
But I'm not your responsibility
anymore.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.098
You can't keep trying
to protect me.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.436
Don't know that I can stop.

35:38.336 --> 35:40.316
Julia.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.675
Peter.
