( exhales )

00:27.493 --> 00:30.196
It's the last one.
( exhales )

00:32.098 --> 00:34.000
Baum: What?

00:34.033 --> 00:36.569
It's the last flask
they gave us.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.938
We're out of drinking water.

00:38.971 --> 00:40.139
We're out of food, too.

00:40.172 --> 00:41.474
Baum: We have to
ask for more, then.

00:41.507 --> 00:44.010
You wanna beg
the psycho samurai
for some charity?

00:44.043 --> 00:45.945
No fucking way.

00:45.978 --> 00:48.047
Besides,

00:48.081 --> 00:49.348
they already locked us out.

00:49.381 --> 00:51.818
There's gotta be
more supplies somewhere.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.720
( panting )

00:57.323 --> 00:59.125
Let's search the rings.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.406
Shun: Lana.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.042
You haven't looked
at me for days.

01:17.076 --> 01:20.113
They were
threatening Lee!

01:20.813 --> 01:22.849
So, you did
the same to them?

01:23.582 --> 01:24.551
They deserved it.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.921
I don't know
what scares me more.

01:28.955 --> 01:31.223
The idea you're infected,

01:31.256 --> 01:34.194
or the idea you're not.

01:38.964 --> 01:40.800
automated voice:<i> Ring 8.</i>

01:43.168 --> 01:47.240
Jesus. What's that smell?

02:06.025 --> 02:08.828
Oh, fuck me.
I forgot about him.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.863
( loud clang )

02:24.911 --> 02:26.412
I can't...

02:27.413 --> 02:28.581
Wait. Where you going?

02:30.850 --> 02:32.852
( breathing heavily )

02:39.925 --> 02:42.195
( machinery whirring )

03:44.657 --> 03:45.925
( laughing )

04:04.510 --> 04:07.580
auctioneer: We're coming
to the final item on our list.

04:07.613 --> 04:12.185
The last Damask
rose bush on Earth.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.387
Current owner, Mr. Walt Weber.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.822
Given the rarity of this item,

04:15.855 --> 04:20.326
I'd like to start the bidding
at five million. Any takers?

04:21.227 --> 04:25.097
Five million.
Five million. Do I hear six?

04:25.131 --> 04:27.033
Six million
from the lovely lady.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.735
Seven million?

04:28.768 --> 04:30.636
( Baum speaking German )

04:30.669 --> 04:32.938
auctioneer: ( in English )
Do I hear seven million?
Any takers?

04:32.971 --> 04:34.741
( Margo speaking German )

04:35.908 --> 04:37.743
auctioneer: ( in English )
Seven million?

04:37.776 --> 04:41.113
Eight million?
Eight million?
Eight million.

04:41.146 --> 04:42.448
( speaks German )

04:42.481 --> 04:43.816
auctioneer: ( in English )
Eight million over there?

04:44.216 --> 04:45.451
Nine million?

04:45.485 --> 04:47.086
Don't put your hands
in the pocket.

04:47.119 --> 04:48.420
Ten million.
Ten million over there.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.822
( speaking German )

04:54.527 --> 04:56.062
auctioneer: ( in English )
Thank you very much.
Ten million.

04:56.095 --> 04:56.963
( speaking German )

05:00.933 --> 05:03.335
auctioneer: ( in English )
Do I hear 11 million?

05:03.369 --> 05:05.337
Do I hear 12 million?

05:05.370 --> 05:07.839
Twelve million,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:07.873 --> 05:10.777
Twelve million from
the gentleman over there.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.944
Thirteen million?

05:11.977 --> 05:14.713
Fourteen million? Fourteen...
Fifteen million?

05:14.746 --> 05:18.050
Fifteen million.
Do I hear 16 million?

05:18.083 --> 05:19.318
No?

05:19.352 --> 05:23.021
Fifteen million going once,
going twice, and sold

05:23.055 --> 05:24.623
-for 15 million!
-( applause )

05:24.657 --> 05:28.193
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,
concludes tonight's auction.

05:28.227 --> 05:31.431
Thank you very much.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.500
( Margo speaking German )

05:58.824 --> 05:59.692

07:06.926 --> 07:10.329
-( Logan gasps )
-Oh, my God!
You scared the hell out of me.

07:10.362 --> 07:11.964
Yeah, likewise.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.701
What are you doing down here?

07:20.740 --> 07:24.177
I can't be long
or they'll notice I'm gone.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.183
Thank you.

07:32.918 --> 07:35.821
Katie: Henri thought
we might be able to spot
something in a scan,

07:35.854 --> 07:38.056
but everything's
completely destroyed.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.792
Logan: Jesus.

07:39.825 --> 07:43.028
I mean, it's gotta be
whoever's infected. Right?

07:43.062 --> 07:46.065
Okay. You can't be
walking around here alone.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.400
I'm serious, Kate.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.136
I'm not worth
risking your neck for.

07:51.870 --> 07:52.738
I disagree.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.751
( speaking German )

08:16.161 --> 08:17.797
( soft music playing )

10:14.613 --> 10:15.815
( beeps )

10:31.496 --> 10:33.099
( chiming )

10:49.214 --> 10:50.883
( in English ) Jackpot.

10:56.021 --> 10:57.356
Shit!

10:57.389 --> 10:58.857
Shit! Shit! Shit!

10:58.891 --> 11:01.660
Hey, they're vitamins,
all right?

11:01.693 --> 11:03.262
For epilepsy?

11:03.295 --> 11:05.130
They're precautionary.

11:05.163 --> 11:06.131
Really?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.935
You didn't have a fit
in the Medical Center?

11:10.635 --> 11:12.171
I lurk.

11:13.939 --> 11:17.275
( scoffs )
Well, congratulations.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.412
Now, you know
I'm a ticking-fucking-timebomb.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.680
You happy?

11:21.714 --> 11:23.449
Oh, shit.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.686
( sighs )

11:33.625 --> 11:35.061
Thanks.

11:39.898 --> 11:42.268
How long
have you been epileptic?

11:45.070 --> 11:47.306
I've had three seizures
my entire life.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.976
I can feel them surfacing.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.745
You know?

11:52.778 --> 11:55.915
But as long as I've got
my meds, and I got regular
food and water,

11:55.948 --> 11:57.683
then I can hold 'em off.

11:57.716 --> 12:01.053
But down here, it's just...

12:02.721 --> 12:04.356
Baum: You could've told me.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.725
( scoffs ) Yeah. Sure.

12:06.758 --> 12:08.660
Have you mocking me
every chance you get?

12:08.694 --> 12:09.995
No, thanks.

12:11.730 --> 12:15.700
Besides, I didn't
want you, or

12:15.734 --> 12:19.939
any of them
to feel sorry for me.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.340
( exhales )

12:27.947 --> 12:29.415
Hey.

12:29.448 --> 12:30.883
What?

12:31.516 --> 12:32.384
Come with me.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.456
Fuck! ( chuckling )

12:40.125 --> 12:41.160
Fuck!

12:43.161 --> 12:44.162
Fuck!

12:44.195 --> 12:45.931
Baum: I think
it's the last one left.

12:45.965 --> 12:50.903
We need authentication,
and my pass is still
in my cabin.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.304
( scoffs )
What? So, it's useless?

12:53.305 --> 12:54.873
Unless

12:54.906 --> 12:57.509
one of us
can bypass the security.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.412
You said you
used to jack cars?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.447
Yeah. Like...

13:02.480 --> 13:04.116
I used to jack cars,

13:04.150 --> 13:05.284
not spacecrafts.

13:06.518 --> 13:07.787
You can try.

13:10.422 --> 13:13.658
( sighs )
You got any tools?

13:13.692 --> 13:15.627
You're healing well.

13:15.661 --> 13:16.661
Yeah.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.664
Henri, he, um...

13:18.697 --> 13:20.966
He helped me. But...

13:22.066 --> 13:24.102
Look, he didn't
wanna do it.

13:24.135 --> 13:26.672
The parasite,
it's in one of us,

13:26.705 --> 13:29.842
and Taylor's body
was all we had to go on

13:29.875 --> 13:32.178
at the time.

13:33.411 --> 13:35.381
I know.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.284
I just wasn't ready
to see him like that.

13:39.684 --> 13:41.520
Look, um,

13:41.553 --> 13:46.191
Lee's told us the<i> Origin</i>
can make it to Thea
without any on-board crew.

13:46.225 --> 13:50.029
But no one knows
whether that hole in Ring 10
is gonna open up again.

13:51.063 --> 13:55.000
I imagine you never
wanna go back to that cell,

13:55.033 --> 13:57.903
but we really need someone
to check it out.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.841
Lana: Stay close.

14:17.956 --> 14:19.592
( breathing heavily )

14:38.410 --> 14:39.979
( gasps )

14:56.094 --> 14:57.429
( device chiming )

14:58.931 --> 15:00.799
Rey: Sealant's stable.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.834
Pressure too.

15:02.867 --> 15:05.837
It looks like
it should hold.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.073
Lana: "Looks like."

15:08.106 --> 15:11.243
Well, this wasn't exactly
part of my job description.

15:20.418 --> 15:21.487
( grunts )

15:22.387 --> 15:25.190
Holy shit.

15:25.223 --> 15:29.327
Okay, dude. This is way out
of my area of expertise, man.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.463
Who doesn't love
a challenge, huh?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.002
That's why you told me.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.372
( scoffs )
You're like a lone wolf.

15:40.405 --> 15:44.109
The only reason you told me
is 'cause you need my help.

15:44.143 --> 15:47.546
Or perhaps, I couldn't
bring myself to abandon you.

15:47.579 --> 15:48.614
Or perhaps,

15:49.481 --> 15:51.383
you can't do this alone.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.288
Keep it between us?

16:12.570 --> 16:13.639
( speaking German )

16:16.041 --> 16:17.743
( chuckles )

17:09.862 --> 17:11.497

17:17.035 --> 17:18.370
( inhales sharply )

17:30.182 --> 17:31.250
( in English ) Hey.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.086
( speaking German )

18:44.555 --> 18:45.524
( scoffs )

19:19.691 --> 19:21.326
Lana: What's in here?

19:21.359 --> 19:23.461
They are your
personal effects.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.831
Would you like to
see yours?

19:54.259 --> 19:55.761
( chiming )

20:35.701 --> 20:37.402
Rey: I'm sorry.

20:38.870 --> 20:39.738
No.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.276
I wasn't ready.

20:45.209 --> 20:48.380
We all left something behind.

21:03.761 --> 21:05.430
( panting )

21:13.905 --> 21:15.340
( grunts ) Fuck!

21:15.373 --> 21:16.475
You fucking crazy?

21:17.909 --> 21:18.877
Sorry.

21:22.213 --> 21:23.515
What's that?

21:24.249 --> 21:27.119
Your personal effects.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.588
I recognize your number.

21:35.059 --> 21:38.195
You didn't
have to do this.

21:38.229 --> 21:40.799
Yes, I did.

22:09.193 --> 22:10.529
( exhales )

22:18.903 --> 22:20.572
( sobbing )

22:33.885 --> 22:35.354
( panting )

22:57.342 --> 22:59.478
Is everything okay?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.948
Can I sit?

23:08.887 --> 23:11.322
I never thanked you

23:11.356 --> 23:13.892
for saving my life.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.660
It was Abigail, really.

23:16.794 --> 23:20.064
She's the one
who did your stitches.

23:20.097 --> 23:21.666
She never told me that.

23:21.699 --> 23:25.236
( chuckles )
Does that surprise you?

23:25.269 --> 23:27.506
-( clattering )
-( Henri gasps )

23:33.278 --> 23:34.679
( clattering continues )

23:48.592 --> 23:52.297
-What are you doing?
-( breathing heavily )

23:52.330 --> 23:53.865
I'm looking for booze!

23:53.899 --> 23:55.500
I just, uh...

23:55.533 --> 23:57.602
I need something, okay?

23:59.237 --> 24:00.238
( sobbing )

24:00.271 --> 24:01.806
It's okay.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.508
It's okay.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.378
People have died.

24:06.411 --> 24:07.779
And there's a fucking thing

24:07.812 --> 24:10.014
inside one of us
that I don't even understand.

24:10.047 --> 24:14.319
And it's like I'm not allowed
to know anyone
or trust anyone.

24:14.352 --> 24:15.554
( exhales )

24:16.454 --> 24:18.156
I am 18 years old.

24:19.590 --> 24:22.227
( sniffles)
I've never even been drunk.

24:23.761 --> 24:28.567
And I don't wanna die
on this ship
having never lived.

24:29.433 --> 24:30.702
( sobbing )

24:35.873 --> 24:38.076
Logan: It's actually
pretty basic in there.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.577
No complicated systems.

24:39.611 --> 24:42.013
Kinda like a homing device.

24:42.046 --> 24:44.816
Meaning it lands itself.

24:44.849 --> 24:47.519
( grunts ) All you gotta
ask yourself is,

24:47.552 --> 24:49.153
"What's worse?"

24:49.187 --> 24:50.922
Trying to hyper-loop to Thea

24:50.955 --> 24:53.691
in a machine that
we don't really
know how to use,

24:53.724 --> 24:56.895
or being stuck
on this shit hole
with a fucking alien.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.969
How can you be so sure
I'm not the alien?

25:05.003 --> 25:07.071
( chuckles ) Come on.

25:07.104 --> 25:08.139
We spent days together.

25:09.040 --> 25:09.941
If you were the alien,

25:09.974 --> 25:13.545
then wouldn't I
already be dead?

25:14.979 --> 25:17.481
So, what you're
basically saying is,

25:17.515 --> 25:19.851
you trust me.

25:21.252 --> 25:22.687
( speaking German )

25:56.453 --> 25:57.656
Mmm-hmm.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.629

27:51.536 --> 27:52.904
I know that I scare you.

27:54.472 --> 27:55.674
But just...

28:02.313 --> 28:04.148
There was this time, right,

28:04.181 --> 28:06.250
when I was a kid.

28:06.284 --> 28:10.154
My brother and I were playing
baseball on our lot.

28:10.188 --> 28:13.558
My brother was trying
for a home run.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.761
One of the older boys
was a real asshole.

28:16.794 --> 28:18.629
Tripped him.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.798
Sprained his ankle.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.902
And I didn't think.

28:25.202 --> 28:29.240
I just grabbed a bat,
and swung it at him.

28:29.273 --> 28:30.942
Broke the kid's shin.

28:31.809 --> 28:33.144
I remember thinking,

28:33.177 --> 28:36.981
maybe it would've helped
with the pain.

28:37.015 --> 28:40.485
Then I looked down
at my brother...

28:42.920 --> 28:45.323
And he was just staring at me.

28:45.356 --> 28:47.992
He was fuckin' terrified.

28:49.727 --> 28:51.830
Of me.

28:58.870 --> 29:03.041
I don't wanna be
the person that I was on Earth.

29:05.510 --> 29:10.147
With everything
that's happening
on this ship, it's just...

29:10.181 --> 29:11.916
Brings back...

29:15.953 --> 29:19.357
Brings back parts of me that

29:19.390 --> 29:21.860
I wanted to forget.

29:32.069 --> 29:33.972
This ship,

29:34.005 --> 29:36.774
the infection, the fear,

29:36.808 --> 29:39.510
all of it,

29:39.543 --> 29:42.780
it makes it

29:42.814 --> 29:46.284
impossible to trust anyone.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.089
But I want to trust you.

29:52.689 --> 29:55.093
Me, too.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.297
( chuckles )

30:00.331 --> 30:02.000
You're a book nerd.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.835
And I had you down
as a complete stoner.

30:04.869 --> 30:06.304
( both chuckle )

30:06.337 --> 30:08.973
What is this?

30:09.006 --> 30:13.210
-Oh. No, no! Give me that!
-( laughs ) Come on.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.280
<i> Love Letters
of Great Men and Women.</i>

30:16.313 --> 30:17.782
Really? ( laughs )

30:17.815 --> 30:20.585
I guess I was trying
to live vicariously.

30:20.618 --> 30:22.853
-( chuckles ) You guess?
-( chuckles )

30:22.886 --> 30:24.688
Oh, this is good.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.524
( laughs )

30:26.557 --> 30:30.061
Oh, I had a look around,
but I couldn't see your box.

30:30.094 --> 30:31.963
Yeah, I don't have one.

30:32.696 --> 30:33.965
Why not?

30:37.301 --> 30:41.239
Didn't have anything
worth bringing.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.953
Now, you do.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.155
( book thuds )

31:06.564 --> 31:07.565
Wait.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.000
What's wrong?

31:13.203 --> 31:15.440
There's something
I have to tell you.

31:20.378 --> 31:23.147
Katie: Wait a second.
This doesn't make sense.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.316
I thought
all the rafts had gone.

31:25.349 --> 31:26.750
How'd you find this?

31:26.784 --> 31:28.318
Baum did.

31:28.352 --> 31:30.821
It needs authorization,
but I'm working on
trying to bypass it.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.156
And when I do,

31:32.189 --> 31:34.658
the three of us,
we're off this hell-hole.

31:34.692 --> 31:37.028
Baum:
What the fuck's goin' on?

31:37.728 --> 31:39.898
What is she doing in here?

31:45.636 --> 31:46.937
Baum:
She's with them, Logan.

31:46.970 --> 31:49.340
No, she's not.
This is a good thing.

31:49.373 --> 31:51.542
Six hands are better
than four, right?

31:51.575 --> 31:53.711
It wasn't your choice to make.

31:53.744 --> 31:56.381
She's coming with us.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.382
That's the end of it.

31:58.549 --> 32:00.117
"The end of it"?

32:00.151 --> 32:01.686
I'm the one
doing all the work.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.288
Right?

32:08.059 --> 32:09.527
( speaking German )

33:14.692 --> 33:16.094
( sighs )

33:42.786 --> 33:43.788
( chiming )

33:46.790 --> 33:48.292
( Margo speaking
over speakers )

33:56.767 --> 33:57.769
( laughing )

34:09.647 --> 34:10.648
( chuckles )

35:10.574 --> 35:11.509
( in English ) Yeah.

35:40.104 --> 35:41.472
( man yelling )

35:44.775 --> 35:46.444
( woman yelling )

35:52.983 --> 35:54.452
( loud hip-hop music playing )

35:56.019 --> 35:57.221
No! No!

35:58.122 --> 35:59.156
No! No!

35:59.189 --> 36:02.225
What the hell
are you guys doing?

36:02.259 --> 36:04.195
Drowning our sorrows?

36:05.162 --> 36:06.464
( sighs )

36:07.431 --> 36:09.600
Sounds like
a fucking good idea.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.235
( all laughing )

36:15.005 --> 36:17.375
( whooping and cheering )

36:43.934 --> 36:45.670
Fuck!

36:50.608 --> 36:51.742
Ow!

36:52.609 --> 36:53.644
( exhales )

36:56.113 --> 36:57.281
I can't do it.

36:57.314 --> 36:58.949
I can't hot-wire
this thing.

36:58.982 --> 37:01.152
Maybe it's for the best.

37:01.185 --> 37:02.520
Yeah, well.
That's easy for you to say.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.323
You know what it's like
living down here?

37:05.356 --> 37:08.859
Every fucking minute
gotta look over
your shoulder?

37:10.794 --> 37:11.996
( exhales )

37:12.696 --> 37:14.565
I really...

37:14.598 --> 37:18.268
I really thought
we could escape, you know?

37:18.302 --> 37:20.438
Goddamn ship.

37:25.709 --> 37:27.178
Is that...

37:27.211 --> 37:28.913
I found it in my cabin.

37:31.281 --> 37:33.016
( exhales )

37:33.050 --> 37:34.451
Why didn't you say
anything to me?

37:34.485 --> 37:36.787
I don't know. I was...

37:36.821 --> 37:38.355
I was scared.

37:38.388 --> 37:40.390
You're not trained
to fly a raft.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.526
These things
fly themselves, Kate.

37:42.559 --> 37:44.094
Look! Look at the pods.

37:44.128 --> 37:47.864
That's what
people always sleep in
while the thing lands itself.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.300
-What?
-Nothing.

37:49.333 --> 37:50.401
-What is it?
-No, it's--

37:50.434 --> 37:52.436
Something else?

37:54.972 --> 37:56.374
It's him, isn't it?

37:56.407 --> 37:58.041
You don't wanna
go with him, do you?

37:58.074 --> 38:00.811
I don't wanna
be locked in there
with someone like that.

38:01.411 --> 38:03.513
And neither should you.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.382
Look, we're not far
from Thea.

38:05.415 --> 38:08.118
Can't you just
wait it out?

38:08.152 --> 38:09.887
He's really not that bad.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.422
No. I don't trust him, Logan.

38:14.725 --> 38:16.360
Okay.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.997
( sighs ) Okay.

38:22.132 --> 38:23.534
What if Baum didn't come?

38:24.201 --> 38:25.569
He's not gonna step down now.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.104
What if we didn't
give him an option?

38:27.137 --> 38:29.339
What if we just go now?

38:29.373 --> 38:30.974
Logan, what--

38:31.007 --> 38:33.544
Shh.
Just give me the pass.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.715
Okay, baby.
Don't fail me, now.

38:37.748 --> 38:38.649

38:38.682 --> 38:40.418
automated voice:
<i> Life raft authenticated.</i>

38:40.451 --> 38:42.752
( laughs ) Yes!

38:42.786 --> 38:45.088
Look! See?

38:45.122 --> 38:46.824
The whole thing's
self-automated.

38:46.857 --> 38:50.894
All we gotta do,
is just get her going.

38:50.927 --> 38:51.796
-Look.
-( chuckles )

38:58.301 --> 38:59.937
I can get us there, Kate.

38:59.970 --> 39:01.038
Just the two of us.

39:01.071 --> 39:03.407
Away from...

39:03.441 --> 39:04.809
From everyone.

39:04.842 --> 39:08.779
Away from all this
fucking bullshit.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.325
If we die,

39:22.359 --> 39:23.627
-it's your fault.
-( both laugh )

39:25.295 --> 39:26.364
Deal.

39:28.365 --> 39:30.634
Listen,
there's one thing.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.269
Yeah?

39:32.302 --> 39:34.671
I need you to get me
some more meds.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.240
-Sure.
-You can do that for me?

39:36.273 --> 39:38.175
-Okay.
-Okay.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.411
-I'll be here.
-Okay.

39:41.978 --> 39:43.047
All right.

Hey, Baum.

41:44.701 --> 41:47.638
All right. Have you ever been
involved with a teacher?

41:48.172 --> 41:49.507
Henri: Yeah.

41:50.507 --> 41:52.109
( Abigail chuckling )

41:54.578 --> 41:56.180
She was hot, okay?

41:56.213 --> 41:57.481
Yes, "she."

41:57.514 --> 41:59.482
Okay. Okay, shush.

41:59.516 --> 42:02.653
Okay. I have never...

42:04.621 --> 42:07.624
( laughing )
I have never...

42:07.657 --> 42:08.726
Danced on a spaceship.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.264
Until now.

42:15.999 --> 42:17.100
Henri: Whoo!

42:17.134 --> 42:18.168
Oh, come on!

42:18.669 --> 42:20.003

42:20.037 --> 42:21.705
-No!
-Not it.

42:22.873 --> 42:23.741
Rey: No.

42:26.143 --> 42:27.944
I do not dance.

42:27.978 --> 42:29.479
Oh, come on!

42:29.513 --> 42:30.948
Abigail: All right,
turn that up.

-What?

43:28.272 --> 43:29.839
A knife in my back?

43:29.873 --> 43:31.642
I found this fucking raft.

43:31.675 --> 43:33.043
I brought you into this.

43:33.076 --> 43:34.744
I know. I'm sorry.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.014
All right? I'm sorry.

Rey: No, no, no.
I'm not a hero.

50:11.274 --> 50:14.243
Oh, please. You're like
our shining beacon of hope.

50:14.277 --> 50:17.046
You're the last member
of SIREN on board.

50:17.080 --> 50:20.450
We are so lucky
to have you here.

50:22.753 --> 50:25.155
Abigail, um...

50:30.326 --> 50:32.496
I'm the reason
for all of this.

50:33.997 --> 50:35.465
What?

50:35.498 --> 50:39.068
I was the rep for Cell 19.
I was supposed to
evacuate you.

50:39.102 --> 50:43.407
But when I found out
Taylor was in trouble, I...

50:45.241 --> 50:46.743
I abandoned protocol.

50:50.513 --> 50:54.584
You didn't wake up
with the others
because I left you.

50:54.618 --> 50:58.655
Eric got out
because I opened the door.

50:59.990 --> 51:01.525
Henri: You...

51:07.230 --> 51:09.332
I'm sorry. I didn't know
how to tell you.

51:12.902 --> 51:15.705
Everyone blamed me.

51:17.173 --> 51:18.742
( voice breaking )
I blamed myself.

51:22.712 --> 51:24.781
I'm sorry.

51:54.811 --> 51:57.347
( exhales ) You know,
I actually almost forgot.

52:00.083 --> 52:02.786
It was just
for a minute. ( sobs )

52:03.719 --> 52:06.256
Me, too.

52:07.090 --> 52:08.758
Katie: Logan.

52:08.792 --> 52:09.793
It's gone.

52:10.193 --> 52:11.895
The raft's gone.

52:12.528 --> 52:14.464
Katie: How?

52:14.497 --> 52:15.365
Fucking Baum.

52:16.466 --> 52:17.700
Logan!

52:17.733 --> 52:19.769
Just leave me alone.

52:20.570 --> 52:22.706
Logan, talk to me.

52:22.739 --> 52:25.208
It's fucking over,
all right?

52:26.976 --> 52:29.246
Go back
to where you belong!

52:31.747 --> 52:33.683
I don't know why you...

52:34.584 --> 52:35.819
( inhales sharply )

52:39.089 --> 52:42.392
You know, you deserve
to be down here.

52:53.202 --> 52:55.772
Fuck! ( sighs )

52:57.607 --> 52:58.641
( sniffles )

52:58.675 --> 52:59.676
( clattering )

53:05.815 --> 53:06.750
Kate!

53:11.854 --> 53:13.890
Katie, I'm sorry. Okay?

53:14.858 --> 53:17.294
I'm an asshole.

53:21.697 --> 53:23.767
Katie?

53:27.303 --> 53:28.872
( gasping softly )

53:31.941 --> 53:33.310
The hell do you want?

53:35.878 --> 53:37.113
Whoa! Put the razor down.

53:37.146 --> 53:38.281
You motherfucker.

53:38.314 --> 53:39.349
Lee: You're epileptic.

53:39.382 --> 53:40.616
Whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo.

53:40.650 --> 53:42.419
When did you
have your first fit?

53:42.452 --> 53:43.520
What?

53:43.553 --> 53:44.887
Tell me how old you were
when you had your first fit.

53:44.921 --> 53:47.490
-You're fucking crazy!
-Answer the fucking
question!

53:47.524 --> 53:49.125
I was nine!

53:49.158 --> 53:51.828
I was nine.

53:51.861 --> 53:52.929
Okay?

53:59.836 --> 54:01.004
It's not you.

54:06.509 --> 54:08.778
You're gonna help me.
