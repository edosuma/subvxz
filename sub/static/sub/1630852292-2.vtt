But one thing's for sure.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.090
You can never outrun your past.

-Don't hurt me.

-This is what you made.
Look me in the eye.
-Please.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.235
Derrick is intimidated by me.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.137
I don't really trust him.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.471
He can be shady.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.235
From here on out,

01:09.235 --> 01:12.906
every elimination
is a double elimination.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.442
One team just couldn't
get it done the fastest.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.210
Ayanna and Nehemiah.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.712
I will be seeing you two
in the Arena.

01:19.712 --> 01:22.148
But the one team
to get it done the fastest

01:22.148 --> 01:24.317
was Derrick and Jodi.

01:24.317 --> 01:25.652
-Yes!
-[excited shouting]

01:25.652 --> 01:28.455
Deliberate and nominate
four players.

Everyone else needs to vote
and select one man and one woman

I've always played this game

01:37.564 --> 01:39.065

01:39.065 --> 01:40.800
This game rewards the opposite.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.470
[Brad]I like Derrick and Jodi,
but I don't envy their position.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.024
[Jodi]Derek and I won today,

03:11.024 --> 03:13.960

have lost,

03:28.508 --> 03:29.842
It's so early in the game

03:29.842 --> 03:33.279
that I haven't developed
any relationships

03:33.279 --> 03:36.683
that would preclude me to say,
"I want this person gone,"

this person is weak."

You can't choose who
you run against in a track meet,

03:47.493 --> 03:51.297
so I'm not gonna choose who I
have to go against in the Arena.

03:51.297 --> 03:55.401
You put in there who you think
you need to put in there.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.837

-Not a one.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.973
I don't care who they choose.

We're gonna walk out of there

04:02.875 --> 04:05.111
[Jodi]I was really hoping
that Ayanna

04:05.111 --> 04:07.380
would help us out a little bit
and give us some names.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.382
She doesn't care,
and so that makes it so hard.

Now we got to pick
both the people.

who I've already beat before.

04:36.609 --> 04:42.982
I just kind of have to start
getting into that mode of war.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.751
I really like him,
but I'm thinking that

04:44.751 --> 04:48.421
that might be one of my
opportunities to-to come back.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.089
I feel like
I like everybody here

04:50.089 --> 04:51.991
for the most part,
so it makes it really hard.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.560
But I know that's not
the game we're playing.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.162
Nehemiah is very clear.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.398
He really wants us
to put Ryan in against him.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.366
I know that's not what this
game is about, but that's--

05:00.366 --> 05:02.435
-I do, too.
-That's really hard for me.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.037
I don't like that idea.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.105
I've gotten close to Ryan just
in the couple days I'm here.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.242
Derrick has past relationship,
friendship with Ryan.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.010
And then
who's your other option?

05:11.010 --> 05:14.280

Maybe later on, you guys think
you can, you know,

05:18.584 --> 05:21.454
give us a little something
if you stay in the game?

it's a two-piece outfit.

It works on Teck definitely.

After it's all said and done,
Nehemiah can try to politic,

06:18.711 --> 06:22.448

should vote for the new guy.

been here a long time.

looking for any reason, like...

saying your name today.

-Right. Yeah.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.209
I love Leah as a person,

I don't see her

06:51.978 --> 06:53.646

to anybody.

the least connections

06:55.681 --> 06:57.049

no chance in this vote.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.369
so I'm just like
a total stranger,

09:30.369 --> 09:33.272
-so there's probably like
zero guilt.
-Mm-hmm.

09:33.272 --> 09:36.042
It is beyond frustrating

09:36.042 --> 09:41.447
how important and how relevant
these past relationships

09:41.447 --> 09:42.982
play in this game,

09:42.982 --> 09:45.718
and that puts me
at a complete disadvantage

09:45.718 --> 09:50.189
because I don't have
that past with these people.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.224
[Casey]
It's a little nerve-racking.

09:52.224 --> 09:56.195
It's also
a little uncomfortable.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.596
I may not even deserve it,

09:57.596 --> 09:59.332
but I feel like
people just put my name up

09:59.332 --> 10:01.400
'cause they're like,
"Oh, Casey won't throw a fit."

10:01.400 --> 10:03.669
But I do have a relationship

10:03.669 --> 10:07.106
with 95% of the people
on the cast this season,

10:07.106 --> 10:10.176
and it goes back over a decade.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.844
I just don't think the house

10:11.844 --> 10:14.580
will put me
into an elimination tonight.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.217
[Brad] I'm sorry that shit
went down like that today.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.485
I know you're working
hard as fuck.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.854
[Nehemiah]
It's not about me though.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.356
It's about my partner, too.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.392
Maybe, but you also
have to be prepared for it to be

10:26.392 --> 10:28.127
an individual, too,
so you might be partnered up,

10:28.127 --> 10:31.330
and it might be winner of
the guys, winner of the girls.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.566
-That's your fucking boy.
-Whoa.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.235
Hey, listen, hold on a second.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.903
It's really not like
I know his...

10:37.903 --> 10:40.039
I don't know his gameplay,
just so you know. I don't.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.741
Being completely honest
with you.

10:41.741 --> 10:44.310
I told him who I wanted to go
against, and it was not Derek.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.145
Derek's name was second.
He said, "Well, who else?"

10:46.145 --> 10:47.513
Told them my number one,

10:47.513 --> 10:49.081
and that number one's
not even up there.

10:49.081 --> 10:52.318
I'm trying to figure out
how Steve's name came up there.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.653
This might be a tool for Derrick

10:54.653 --> 10:57.323
to try to have me
take out a wild card.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.059
[dramatic music playing]

11:00.059 --> 11:02.928
Derrick, just know
that you revealed your hand

11:02.928 --> 11:04.463
way too early in this game,

11:04.463 --> 11:07.867
and the last thing that you want
to do is double-cross me.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.670
You better believe that
I'm coming for you and only you.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.413
[Jodi]Do you feel like
we need to go talk to Derek?

11:20.413 --> 11:21.647
[Derrick K]Yeah.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.049
Where's Derek?
Where's Chavez at?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.786
Went to Nehemiah,
and we asked him who he wanted.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.587
He gave us two names.
We gave him one.

11:28.587 --> 11:31.223
-I know this is your guy.
-[Jodi] But we gave him one

11:31.223 --> 11:33.059
that we felt the house
is not gonna vote for.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.927
[Derrick]
Um, 'cause the other guy

11:34.927 --> 11:37.096
that we put in
is the new guy, right?

11:37.096 --> 11:38.631
-Steve.
-[Derek C] Okay.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.333
Uh, can I ask you why,
out of the two of us, it was me?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.936
I've been talking to him.
We-we just been closer.

11:43.936 --> 11:46.072
I, you know, I go way back
with him, and that's it.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.107
[Derek C]It's kind of
nerve-racking because

11:48.107 --> 11:50.276
I've been
in this situation before.

11:50.276 --> 11:53.712
I've gone in first
and I've lost two of them, so...

11:53.712 --> 11:54.880
[woman] Come on, Derek.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.483
-[airhorn blows]
-[all cheering]

11:57.483 --> 11:59.752
This is my time for redemption.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.187
There's more than just the money

12:01.187 --> 12:02.922
that I'm fighting for
in this game,

12:02.922 --> 12:04.590
and I'm gonna do
whatever it takes

12:04.590 --> 12:06.258
to stay here as long as I can.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.294
[Jodi] I don't see you being
in jeopardy at all, honestly.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.329
But-but... but just in case,
start playing the game,

12:10.329 --> 12:12.364
get your people
to-to back you up.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.433
-That's the best I can do.
-It just sucks in the moment.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.535
It just sucks, like,
to have to do this.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.537
-Yeah.
-Don't cry, yeah.

12:18.537 --> 12:19.805
-It's fine.
-It's fine.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.307
-Jodi crying.
-Sorry, I don't like

12:21.307 --> 12:23.275
-this part of this.
-[laughs] It's okay.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.511
-I know. It's fucking terrible.
-I don't want to put anybody in.

12:25.511 --> 12:26.712
-[sniffles]
-We know.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.214
[Jodi]He didn't see it coming,

12:28.214 --> 12:30.216
and I'm really upset by that
'cause I don't like

12:30.216 --> 12:31.784
hurting people's feelings ever.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.252
-[sniffles]
-I am

12:33.252 --> 12:36.188
really, honestly sick
to my stomach.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.993
He's untrustworthy.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.661
Who do I need to talk to?

12:42.661 --> 12:44.196
[Melinda] I don't know.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.966
I don't know
what to do at this point.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.005
Mm-mm.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.908
[Nehemiah]
But if-if people know me...

12:55.908 --> 12:58.711
people know me,
it doesn't matter about him.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.250
[suspenseful music playing]

13:11.323 --> 13:13.192
I'm gonna look every single
one of you in the face

13:13.192 --> 13:15.861
and tell you exactly
who it is that I want.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.963
-Not Steve.
-Not Steve.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.432
No fucking bullshit.
I want Derek.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.469
In this game,
if you don't vocalize

13:23.469 --> 13:25.504
what it is
that you want to happen,

13:25.504 --> 13:27.706
then the people who are in power

13:27.706 --> 13:29.375
will dictate
what happens to you.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.912
I didn't come here
to make a name for myself

13:32.912 --> 13:34.780
or to try to boost my ego.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.816
My future kids
cannot eat legacy.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.786
My goal is to win.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.958
[dramatic music playing]

13:57.736 --> 13:59.138
[Ayanna]I'll tell you this.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.774
If you put me up against
Casey or Leah,

14:01.774 --> 14:03.342
they're really gonna
have to dig deep

14:03.342 --> 14:05.611
because I'm coming with
my "why" on my chest

14:05.611 --> 14:08.781
with a capital W-H-Y.

14:08.781 --> 14:12.218
I have four kids. I'm not
trying to go home this time.

14:12.218 --> 14:16.155
So, um, as most of you know,
I'm, like, a really nice person

14:16.155 --> 14:19.658
and, uh, there's just, like,
one way to upset me.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.160
It's not by going after me.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.163
It's going after somebody
that I really care about.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.032
And, I mean, it's obvious,
like, I'm just really upset.

14:27.032 --> 14:31.170
Like, why did you say
that you wanted Derek?

14:32.471 --> 14:35.608
I said my number one
choice was Ryan.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.510
And then I said,
if it had to be someone else,

14:38.510 --> 14:40.379
I will go against Derek.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.281
[Jasmine]Coming after Cancun

14:42.281 --> 14:45.784
is not what you want
to do, Nehemiah.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.987
Now you're coming for my family.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.923
Now we have a really big
fucking problem.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.392
And I'm the wrong bitch.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.895
I've played this game
with my heart on my sleeve

14:56.895 --> 14:58.797
for the last six seasons.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.666
Every single time
I've done that,

15:00.666 --> 15:03.636
I've left with a broken heart,
I've left with tears in my eyes,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.804
and I've left with
no money in my bank.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.906
For one of the very first times,

15:07.906 --> 15:10.242
I'm fighting for
more than myself.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.678
I am fighting for
the rest of my family,

15:12.678 --> 15:15.914
to make sure that
I am that rock financially

15:15.914 --> 15:17.116
that they can depend on.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.651
For the first time,

15:18.651 --> 15:21.553
I had to play this game
as a business.

15:21.553 --> 15:24.123
I want to punch Nehemiah
in the fucking throat.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.292
Just say that you think
I'm a skinny dude

15:26.292 --> 15:27.726
that's not strong enough
to face you.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.496
Okay, I'll just start the voting
'cause, I mean,

15:30.496 --> 15:32.564
it's obvious
who I'm voting for: Steve.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.635
I'm not gonna vote for Derek,
so my vote is for you.

15:36.635 --> 15:41.540
And I've known you longer, so,
Leah, I'm gonna vote for you.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.178
I'd say Derek and Leah.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.348
I'm not voting for Steve.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.517
I have to vote
for Derek and Casey.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.953
I just met both of y'all, and
I think both of y'all are great.

15:54.953 --> 15:57.523
But Nehemiah came to me,
and, Derek,

15:57.523 --> 15:58.791
he said he wanted to go
against you,

15:58.791 --> 16:00.326
and that's who I'm gonna pick.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.761
Uh, out of y'all two,
I've known Casey for years,

16:02.761 --> 16:06.165
so I apologize,
but, Leah, you're my vote.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.833
[Tyler] It's not personal.
This is a drag.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.835
I can't put my two sisters in,

16:09.835 --> 16:12.438
so I have to vote for Steve
and Leah unfortunately.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.474
These explanations
are complete bullshit.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.643
My vote's for Derek and Leah.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.112
Derek and then Leah.

16:20.112 --> 16:23.082
Sorry, Derek. I'm gonna
have to put you in, Leah.

16:23.082 --> 16:26.485
[Derrick K]I'm really thinking
that Steve is going to

16:26.485 --> 16:29.788
get all the votes
by a landslide.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.423
I did not see this coming.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.825
I'm very close with Nehemiah.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.094
Derek, I've got to vote
for you, so sorry.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.395
And unfortunately, Leah,

16:36.395 --> 16:38.464
I've got to vote for you, too,
so sorry.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.032
Steve, I have to vote you in.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.301
Leah, I'm sorry, sweetie,
my vote's for you.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.269
[Laterrian] I'm not voting
Steve in. Sorry, Derek.

16:44.269 --> 16:47.106
Steve and I go back a minute.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.374
And I vote for Casey.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.544
-Steve and Leah for me.
-Derek and Leah.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.613
[Derek C]It's a little
heartbreaking because

16:54.613 --> 16:56.415
I feel like
I'm friends with everybody.

16:56.415 --> 16:57.850
I feel like
I've had great conversations

16:57.850 --> 16:59.451
with every single person.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.454
So to hear them all
basically say my name

17:02.454 --> 17:04.423
motivates me a little harder.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.258
I'm gonna show them
why I'm an All Star

17:06.258 --> 17:07.659
and I deserve to be here.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.862
Nehemiah, we were on
the same season together.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.430
I want to respect his wishes.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.900
I'm voting for you,
and my vote will be for Leah.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.935
I need to make more friends.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.338
-[laughter]
-Damn.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.875
I've known Derek ten years plus,
so I can't vote for you.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.276
[laughter]

17:24.276 --> 17:25.677
Uh, so my vote is for Leah.

17:25.677 --> 17:27.079
What I will say, like,

17:27.079 --> 17:28.814
Derek absolutely
came third today.

17:28.814 --> 17:33.285
And my name was put out there,
and I understand that, Nehemiah,

17:33.285 --> 17:34.953
'cause I am
the smallest guy here,

17:34.953 --> 17:37.923
probably the least athletic, but
I think it's kind of bullshit.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.392
You told me that I would be
the last name out of your mouth.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.960
[Nehemiah] Yeah, I said that
before we knew the game,

17:41.960 --> 17:43.729
-and I said that
you and Derek...
-Your word is your word.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.431
...were the only two people
that I've gone against,

17:45.431 --> 17:46.999
and that's why I feel
comfortable going against,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.534
so it is what it is.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.236
-It is. Oh, you...
-500,000. How often do we talk?

17:51.236 --> 17:53.739
-Thank you.
-[dramatic music playing]

17:53.739 --> 17:55.307
Voices start elevating.

17:55.307 --> 17:56.842
People start being
accused of things.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.677
How often do you reach out to me
before a challenge?

17:58.677 --> 18:00.312
How often do we...
You reach out to me.

18:00.312 --> 18:01.547
What are you talking about?

18:01.547 --> 18:02.714
Are you absolutely
out of your mind?

18:02.714 --> 18:03.949
[Cohutta]And this nice,

18:03.949 --> 18:05.250
jovial attitude everybody had...

18:05.250 --> 18:06.952
"Oh, welcome back."

18:06.952 --> 18:09.054
-That shit is... [whistles]
-[Nehemiah and Ryan arguing]

18:09.054 --> 18:10.689
[Nehemiah] I came to you and I
told you that I said your name.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.192
-I just don't trust you anymore.
-Fine.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.427
[dramatic music playing]

18:17.830 --> 18:21.867
Why don't we leave
the negativity and the energy

18:21.867 --> 18:23.335
in this space for tonight,

18:23.335 --> 18:25.571
'cause let's make this
a night to remember.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.774
-[cheering]
-Get that damn prom downstairs.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.211
If... 'cause if
it's your last day,

18:32.211 --> 18:34.112
I want you to go out on top.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.781
[excited chatter]

18:35.781 --> 18:37.816
[mellow music playing]

18:42.087 --> 18:43.655

28:52.163 --> 28:54.199
but under
a little bit of stress,

28:54.199 --> 28:55.900
you can miss
some of the numbers.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.669
They got to read something.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.104
[excited chatter]

29:01.439 --> 29:04.109
-Check.
-That's correct.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.712
[Jasmine] Keep going, Derek!
You're still in this!

29:07.712 --> 29:11.983
Nehemiah may be a little bit
more muscular and all that,

29:11.983 --> 29:15.086
but he's all talk and no bite.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.554
Derek can win this.

29:16.554 --> 29:19.357
I just want him to have
a chance in this game.

29:19.357 --> 29:22.193
Focus, Derek! Focus, babe!

29:22.193 --> 29:23.928
You got this! Go! Come on!

29:23.928 --> 29:25.296
[tense music plays]

29:25.296 --> 29:27.132
[Tina]
You got it. Come on, D.

29:27.132 --> 29:29.767
[Derrick K]I'm rooting for
Derek in this elimination

29:29.767 --> 29:32.437
because I still don't know
where me and Nehemiah stand,

29:32.437 --> 29:34.772
so him coming back to the game

29:34.772 --> 29:37.542
is still kind of
a shaky territory for me.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.944
-Come on, Nehemiah!
-Let's go.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.513
Attaboy.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.047
-Attaboy.
-[Tina] Okay, Derek, keep going.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.449
[grunts fiercely]

29:44.449 --> 29:45.650
[Nehemiah]
It's literally like pulling

29:45.650 --> 29:48.052
a baby elephant
who is resisting.

29:48.052 --> 29:49.954
Not only do I have to pull
300 pounds,

29:49.954 --> 29:51.723
but I have to pull it
in the sand.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.259
I can't get a foot grip.
I can't really get a hand grip.

29:54.259 --> 29:55.793
I have to figure out a strategy

29:55.793 --> 29:58.530
so I don't burn out
just on this one coffin.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.231
Slow and steady! Let's go!

30:00.231 --> 30:02.233
Take your time.
You should breathe.

30:02.233 --> 30:03.968
[Tina]
You hear 300 pounds,

30:03.968 --> 30:07.172
but when he starts pulling
that coffin across the Arena

30:07.172 --> 30:10.408
and you see the sweat
bead up within seconds.

30:10.408 --> 30:13.878
Nehemiah is a very fit man.

30:13.878 --> 30:18.082
Derek C, oof, I don't know
how he's gonna do it.

30:18.783 --> 30:22.387
Let's go.
Almost there. Almost there.

That's one! Attaboy!

30:26.291 --> 30:28.960

-That's correct. Go.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.262
Yeah, Derek!

30:32.030 --> 30:33.464
Come on, Derek!

30:35.200 --> 30:37.435

-Oh, shit.

with his first coffin.

I'm thinking that Derek's
gonna struggle with this,

who's so close to you.

[Derek C]I really thought
I had this one.

I'm super proud of myself
because it was physical,

34:52.356 --> 34:54.759
and Nehemiah isn't,
isn't any, any small guy.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.461
He's still pretty big,

to give him a run for his money.

I couldn't make it
all the way for her,

35:04.368 --> 35:06.337
I know she'd definitely
still be super proud

35:06.337 --> 35:07.939
that I didn't give up.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.874

35:09.874 --> 35:13.311
And I know... I know that
she's looking down at me

35:13.311 --> 35:15.680
and excited to see me do
what I love to do,

35:15.680 --> 35:18.749
so for me to be able
to still do that,

35:18.749 --> 35:21.385
it means a lot and I'm
so thankful for the opportunity.

the first one to go home,

to send somebody home.

back into that game

done and walk away with the win.

in any way, shape or form,

you know that

38:41.886 --> 38:43.954
she would've smoked
half the dudes in the house.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.456
I mean, you look at Nehemiah,
he over there

38:45.456 --> 38:47.024
look like he pulling elephants,

38:47.024 --> 38:49.527
when Ayanna over here
pulling cotton balls.

38:49.527 --> 38:51.295
I mean, the girl is strong.

38:52.196 --> 38:55.266
-There you go!
-Let's go, Ayanna!

38:55.266 --> 38:57.435
Good job, Ayanna!

38:57.435 --> 38:59.437
Inch by inch girl, come on!

38:59.437 --> 39:01.172
This is the hardest one.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.941
[excited shouting]

39:07.278 --> 39:09.280
[applause]

39:10.347 --> 39:12.016
Now pull!

39:12.016 --> 39:14.952
-There you go! There you go!
-Yes!

39:14.952 --> 39:16.554
-Good job, Leah. Come on.
-Keep pulling!

39:16.554 --> 39:19.390
-Inch by inch, Leah.
-Come on, Ayanna!

39:21.025 --> 39:23.394
Come on, Leah.
You got it, girl. Come on.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.596
Harness that power.

39:27.798 --> 39:29.200
Good job, Ayanna!

39:29.200 --> 39:31.068
-[whooping]
-Yeah!

39:31.068 --> 39:32.870
[excited shouting]

39:34.004 --> 39:36.240
-Powerful as fuck!
-[airhorn blows]

39:36.240 --> 39:37.541
Powerful as fuck!

39:37.541 --> 39:39.643

-Powerful as fuck!

39:39.643 --> 39:42.613
-Wear that "Why"!
Wear that "Why"!
-Powerful as fuck!

39:42.613 --> 39:46.117
Wear that "Why"!
Wear that motherfucking "Why"!

-[sobs]
-You wear it.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.354
You did it! You did it!

39:50.354 --> 39:51.622
Ah, you didn't give up.

39:51.622 --> 39:53.257
-[sobs]
-You did such a good job.

39:53.257 --> 39:55.292
[Ayanna] Good one, Leah!
Let's go!

39:55.292 --> 39:57.027
Come on, let's get it.

39:57.027 --> 39:59.764
Leah and I share
a lot of commonalities.

39:59.764 --> 40:02.333
No, you're not gonna give up.
Let's do it. Come on!

40:02.333 --> 40:06.070
And there are so many times in
life that when you are out there

40:06.070 --> 40:08.105
really trying to make it work
for your family,

40:08.105 --> 40:10.407
that sometimes
you need a lifeline.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.276
She's gonna remember
her power today.

40:12.276 --> 40:14.145
We are gonna get this done.

[Derrick K]What I'm seeing
right now is unbelievable.

40:47.411 --> 40:50.381
We've never seen anything
like this in Challenge history.

40:50.381 --> 40:54.518
If there's ever a moment that
I want to watch with my son,

40:54.518 --> 40:55.853
it's this one.

40:55.853 --> 40:58.255
Thank you for
this memory, Ayanna.

Come in here.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.211
[Leah]
I didn't give up.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.779
I didn't win,

41:21.779 --> 41:23.614
but it wasn't a matter of
how much heart I put into it.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.984
I-I truly...
I just couldn't pull it.

41:26.984 --> 41:31.856
Coming into this after
so many years was terrifying.

41:31.856 --> 41:34.091
I'm gonna miss you guys,

41:34.091 --> 41:35.593
and, um...

41:36.660 --> 41:38.229
...I love some of you.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.630
Not all of you, but some of you.

41:39.630 --> 41:40.731
Most of you.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.399
-We all won.
-All Stars.

41:42.399 --> 41:44.401
-We all won. We all won.
-All Stars, baby.

41:44.401 --> 41:45.703
-Here we go, baby.
-We all won.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.938
-Superheroes, baby!
-We all won!

41:50.274 --> 41:54.511
Well, I have to say that was
a very solid elimination round.

41:54.511 --> 41:56.547
Everyone should be
proud of themselves.

41:56.547 --> 41:58.716
[cheering, applause]

41:59.617 --> 42:02.486
Yay! Good job, players!

42:02.486 --> 42:04.755
[TJ] Derek, Leah,

42:04.755 --> 42:06.390
this ends your time here
onThe Challenge for now.

42:06.390 --> 42:09.460
But I really hope that we see
both of you in the future.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.462
-Take care of yourselves.
-[whooping]

42:11.462 --> 42:13.764
-[cheering]
-We love you!

42:13.764 --> 42:16.400
-We love you!
-Yeah!

42:16.400 --> 42:17.902
[whoops]

42:21.572 --> 42:24.808
[MJ]Now we got Leah going home.
We got Derek C going home.

42:24.808 --> 42:27.611
We've been kind of
having a good time,

42:27.611 --> 42:30.881
a few laughs here, drinks there,
but this is real.

42:30.881 --> 42:35.386
We got two people that no longer
have a shot at winning $500,000.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.521
[cheering, applause]

42:38.656 --> 42:40.190
Kick their ass!

42:41.725 --> 42:47.097
[TJ] Now, Nehemiah, Ayanna,
with winning comes power.

42:48.465 --> 42:51.235
-You have just
earned a life shield.
-[others oohing]

42:51.235 --> 42:53.837
You can use the life shield
to save yourself

42:53.837 --> 42:55.773
if you lose the next challenge,

42:55.773 --> 42:58.809
or you can use it
on one of the nominees.

43:00.611 --> 43:04.114
[Laterrian]This newfound power
of the life shield is awesome.

43:04.114 --> 43:07.751
I think you should earn
something if you win elimination

43:07.751 --> 43:10.054
besides just
going back to the house.

43:10.054 --> 43:12.589
Getting to save yourself
or save one of your friends

43:12.589 --> 43:14.925
from the next elimination
is pretty cool.

43:14.925 --> 43:18.128
Just know,
if you use the life shield,

43:18.128 --> 43:20.464
you will no longer
have a vote in the selection.

43:20.464 --> 43:23.834
Take your life shields, get up
there and rejoin the group.

43:23.834 --> 43:25.569
[cheering, applause]

43:25.569 --> 43:27.838
Welcome back!

43:29.239 --> 43:31.241
[Nehemiah]
I feel like last season we had

43:31.241 --> 43:33.344
a little bit more camaraderie
in the home.

43:33.344 --> 43:34.878
When I'm looking at this group,

43:34.878 --> 43:37.181
I feel like these people
are way more cutthroat.

43:37.181 --> 43:39.583
This time, I'm gonna be
a lot more calculated.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.218
I'm gonna be a lot more focused.

43:41.218 --> 43:43.120
I came here to win.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.623
That 500,000 is the main thing
on my mind right now,

43:46.623 --> 43:48.225
and that's it.

43:48.225 --> 43:50.294
I'll see you at the next
challenge. Get out of here.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.595
-Yeah!

Around the Block.

-Go, go, go, go!
-Right now!

44:11.949 --> 44:13.584
Put this piece here now!

44:13.584 --> 44:15.119
[Tina]
The heat is getting to us.

44:15.119 --> 44:17.354
The puzzle's hard.
We're breaking down.

44:17.354 --> 44:19.390
We were homeys,
but now there's something?

44:19.390 --> 44:21.258
Did I do something wrong?
Was it that bad?

44:21.258 --> 44:22.626
Doesn't make any sense.

44:22.626 --> 44:25.396
I know exactly
who I'm not saving: Tina.

44:25.396 --> 44:26.630
She's gonna be
very, very afraid.
