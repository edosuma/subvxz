our first patient?

05:11.903 --> 05:14.603
- Joe Cocker.
- Nice.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.841
A fellow countryman and
a great performer.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.547
And the brother could move.

- Yeah.

the ground rules.

06:16.765 --> 06:18.165
Let me be perfectly clear.

06:20.437 --> 06:22.669
I need you to cooperate
in every possible way

06:22.671 --> 06:25.706
or your time here will be unpleasant.
It's completely up to you.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.141
I talk, you listen. I
question, you answer.

06:28.143 --> 06:30.811
This is non-negotiable.
Do you understand?

06:30.813 --> 06:33.780
Now, I'm sure you're surprised to learn
that I can communicate with you.

06:33.782 --> 06:36.684
- How?
- I believe that qualifies as a question.

06:37.819 --> 06:40.220
So you got a name?

06:40.222 --> 06:42.222
I see here that you
had no identification

06:42.224 --> 06:44.090

06:44.092 --> 06:46.525
I'm gonna call you Joe.

06:46.527 --> 06:49.028
- Joe Cocker.
- Why?

06:49.030 --> 06:51.197
Yet again with the questions.

06:51.199 --> 06:53.735
Let's review, shall we?
I ask, you answer.

06:56.104 --> 06:57.937
Where are you from?

06:59.874 --> 07:01.807
- Minnesota.
- Minnesota.

07:01.809 --> 07:03.843
There we go. That
wasn't that hard.

07:03.845 --> 07:07.614
- And when were you infected?
- It was the end of October.

07:08.049 --> 07:09.583
What?

07:10.617 --> 07:12.018
It was the end of October?

07:12.020 --> 07:14.819
We were putting up
Halloween decorations.

07:14.821 --> 07:16.124
You're certain?

07:18.992 --> 07:20.560
You're sure about that?

07:21.194 --> 07:22.696
<b></font></b> Yeah.

07:29.803 --> 07:31.171
Get me the Minnesota file.

07:32.606 --> 07:34.326
Bring up all that data
we have on Minnesota.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.673
And tell Morgan to keep
pushing him on that.

07:36.675 --> 07:38.575
- On it.
- What are his vitals?

07:38.577 --> 07:39.880
Let me check.

07:41.148 --> 07:43.081
Okay, and who bit you?

07:46.886 --> 07:50.587
Geographically possible.
Look, November, December.

07:50.589 --> 07:51.822
It's not even close.

07:51.824 --> 07:53.759
This is one of the
earliest we've spoken to.

07:55.961 --> 07:58.062
Come on, Morgan,
give me what I need.

07:58.064 --> 07:59.696
Tell me about the attack today?

07:59.698 --> 08:02.666
We couldn't believe our luck
when your soldiers showed up.

08:02.668 --> 08:04.868
The feeling I felt in my gut...

08:04.870 --> 08:06.670
- You mean the burn?
- What?

08:06.672 --> 08:08.939
You mean the burn, the
burn to commit violence,

08:08.941 --> 08:11.175
to be violent, to tear
someone's head off.

08:11.177 --> 08:14.244
To rip someone's teeth out.
You're talking about the burn?

08:14.246 --> 08:17.181
Yeah, I know about
the burn, Joe.

08:17.183 --> 08:18.950
We're not that
different, me and you.

08:21.019 --> 08:22.985
Like lust.

08:22.987 --> 08:25.188
I understand you, buddy.

08:25.190 --> 08:26.691
And I wanna help you.

08:29.127 --> 08:30.929
Joe.

08:32.197 --> 08:34.263
So how many of you
were traveling today?

08:34.265 --> 08:37.166
- 200, 250.
- 250? That's a lot.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.102
We ripped your soldiers apart.

08:39.104 --> 08:41.037
And if it weren't
for these chains...

08:41.039 --> 08:43.640
Hey, hey, hey, have you ever
heard of Daniel Burnham?

08:44.943 --> 08:47.110
So, Daniel Burnham
was an architect.

08:47.112 --> 08:48.877
This brilliant architect. Okay?

08:48.879 --> 08:51.746
He designed all these famous
buildings across the United States

08:51.748 --> 08:54.350
including, actually the
first skyscraper in Chicago

08:54.352 --> 08:57.286
and that amazing building
in New York City,

08:57.288 --> 09:02.924
the Flatiron. Anyway, his
real passion was wine.

09:02.926 --> 09:05.861
Danny Burnham shipped his
around the world, twice,

09:05.863 --> 09:09.798
on these slow freighters.
So, sometimes the wine

09:09.800 --> 09:14.102
would take years, and years,
and years to come back to him.

09:14.104 --> 09:17.105
Anyway, one day, me and my wife,

09:17.107 --> 09:19.975
we're in this really beautiful building
that Burnham designed in like,

09:19.977 --> 09:22.776
nineteen hundred and something.

09:22.778 --> 09:27.681
And we come across five
old, beautiful, dusty cases

09:27.683 --> 09:30.184
of Daniel Burnham's wine.
The point is,

09:30.186 --> 09:34.321
whenever Daniel Burnham opened a bottle
of his wine amongst his buddies,

09:34.323 --> 09:36.403
he would read them the long
list of all the countries

09:36.427 --> 09:38.759
that each specific
bottle had traveled,

09:38.761 --> 09:42.363
so whenever they drank it they
knew it wasn't just a sip

09:42.365 --> 09:45.266
of beautiful wine,

09:45.268 --> 09:47.736
this was a trip around
the motherfucking world.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.808
This wine is my only
connection to the past, Joe.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.779
To the world as it was.

09:58.847 --> 10:01.215
Remember that.

10:01.217 --> 10:05.187
You know, Joe, I've forgotten
what fresh air feels like.

10:06.888 --> 10:09.856
And sunlight. I hate this place.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.424
I hate seeing you
people in pain.

10:11.426 --> 10:13.126
I hate not being
able to help you,

10:13.128 --> 10:17.864
but I wanna understand you, Joe.
I do.

10:17.866 --> 10:19.832
<b></b> <i>Looks like we're making
real progress in there.</i>

Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

10:23.305 --> 10:25.438
Don't make me. Come on, man.
Take it easy.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.939
I wanna help you.

10:29.444 --> 10:31.910
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me!

10:31.912 --> 10:33.714
What is wrong with you?

10:35.283 --> 10:37.417
I'm trying to make progress in there.
What is it with this dude?

10:37.419 --> 10:39.351
- Are you all right?
- No. Yeah. I'm fine.

10:39.353 --> 10:42.187
- What's he keep saying in there?
- For me to go fuck myself.

10:42.189 --> 10:43.989
<b></b> Tell him we'd all

10:50.164 --> 10:51.863
Last October.

10:51.865 --> 10:53.332
No, that we celebrated.

10:53.334 --> 10:55.970
Oh. Um, a year and a half ago.

10:57.238 --> 10:59.173
My Tommy was Spiderman.

11:00.940 --> 11:03.141
- I want some answers.
- Back off, Colonel.

11:03.143 --> 11:05.479
- What is the problem?
- Colonel, there is no problem.

11:05.713 --> 11:07.633
I just need the subject to calm down.
That's all.

11:07.657 --> 11:09.414
Bullshit. Get him back inside

11:09.416 --> 11:12.049
and show that monster who's
in charge, or I will.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.320
- That's enough, Colonel.
- This guy, man.

11:17.323 --> 11:18.889
You're damn right it is.

11:20.793 --> 11:22.026
- What's he doing?
- Colonel!

11:22.028 --> 11:23.194
- Hey! Hey!
- What?

11:28.067 --> 11:30.101
Now, he looks pretty
damn calm to me.

11:30.103 --> 11:31.383
What the fuck is wrong with you?

11:31.407 --> 11:32.869
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

11:32.871 --> 11:35.206
- He was wasting our time.
- He was from Minnesota.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.806
He was infected Halloween night,

11:36.808 --> 11:38.648
that predates any previous
record of infection.

11:38.672 --> 11:41.445
He might, he just might, have
been a link to Patient Zero.

11:41.447 --> 11:43.514
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#D900D9">Get your hands off me.

11:43.516 --> 11:45.284
You're gonna shoot me, Colonel?

11:47.986 --> 11:50.989
There are a million
more just like him.

11:51.456 --> 11:53.156
What the...

11:53.158 --> 11:55.358
Put the fucking wine away.
Clean up this shit.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.360
- You're an asshole.
- Let's bring in the next one.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.230
You were born an asshole, and you
will fucking die an asshole.

12:00.232 --> 12:05.502
I hate this fucking place!

12:05.504 --> 12:07.437
You overstep your
authority like that again

12:07.439 --> 12:09.172
and I'll have you
stripped of your command.

12:09.174 --> 12:12.074
- My orders...
- Your orders are to protect

12:12.076 --> 12:15.311
my laboratory. What we do
here is scientific research,

12:15.313 --> 12:18.548
not executions. You shot
him to get even with me.

12:18.550 --> 12:20.482
Don't even think
about denying it.

12:20.484 --> 12:22.985
You're upset that I put you down
and spoke to you like a child.

12:22.987 --> 12:25.454
But I have no choice when you
continue to act like a child.

12:25.456 --> 12:27.323
I get that you're frustrated,

12:27.325 --> 12:30.159
that you're posted to a scientific
operation and not a military one.

12:30.161 --> 12:33.962
I understand, but you do
something like that again

12:33.964 --> 12:36.532
and I promise you will rue
the day that we ever met,

12:36.534 --> 12:39.069
if you don't already.
Are we clear, Colonel?

12:47.345 --> 12:49.212
I'll take that as a yes.

12:55.852 --> 12:58.486
He was traveling in a much
larger pack than normal today.

12:58.488 --> 13:00.188
250, he said, you know.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.030
A wolf-pack stays big
enough to hunt as a team,

13:02.054 --> 13:03.591
but small enough
to feed everybody.

13:03.593 --> 13:06.561
And 250 is not a pack,
it's a goddamn army.

13:06.563 --> 13:08.563
I'd like you to calm down.
Take a couple of these.

13:08.565 --> 13:11.532
No! No! I cannot
take any more pills.

13:11.534 --> 13:13.401
It's driving me insane.

13:13.403 --> 13:16.537
I keep having these nightmares.
These vivid flashbacks.

13:16.539 --> 13:18.341
Stay still, I'm gonna
take your pulse.

13:19.908 --> 13:22.510
Yes, flashbacks, okay. Go on.

13:22.512 --> 13:26.980
I can hear her scream,
but I can't, I just... <b></b>

13:26.982 --> 13:28.515
I can't reach her, you know.

13:28.517 --> 13:31.453
- Stop torturing yourself.
- That's all I do. Torture myself.

13:32.921 --> 13:34.223
Stop.

13:37.493 --> 13:39.559
You know Janet and
I had this thing.

13:39.561 --> 13:41.428
We never liked saying
goodbye to each other

13:41.430 --> 13:43.132
because it sounds so permanent.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.566
So instead of saying goodbye,

13:46.568 --> 13:49.671
we would pick a random
topic from the alphabet.

13:50.972 --> 13:53.339
And we would recycle
through all 26 letters

13:53.341 --> 13:55.910
over and over again, but we
would never say the words,

13:57.011 --> 13:59.013
- "Goodbye."
- That's cute.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.649
Yeah.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.018
Yeah, that's cute.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.923
Don't you miss that? Don't
you miss being cute?

14:10.425 --> 14:14.195
Being human? Hell, yeah.

14:17.498 --> 14:19.132
You're fine.

15:32.237 --> 15:33.606
Hope you're being safe.

15:34.205 --> 15:35.639
Excuse me.

15:35.641 --> 15:38.474
Is it advisable to consort with
someone who's been bitten,

15:38.476 --> 15:40.543
from a scientific perspective?

15:40.545 --> 15:42.411
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

15:42.413 --> 15:45.147
Or maybe this is some
perverse line of research.

15:45.149 --> 15:47.619
I don't know. You tell me.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.556
- Oh, my God. That's it.
- What?

15:54.592 --> 15:57.795
You're upset that I care
for Morgan, aren't you?

15:59.297 --> 16:03.398
- Excuse me?
- Colonel, I wouldn't have chosen you

16:03.400 --> 16:05.302
if you were the
last man on Earth.

16:07.605 --> 16:09.104
You know the first
thing they teach

16:09.106 --> 16:10.426
a ranger about
counter-insurgence?

16:10.450 --> 16:12.820
Oh, please enlighten me.

16:13.011 --> 16:15.477
When confronted with a group
of suspected terrorists,

16:15.479 --> 16:18.048
and one in that group is a
woman, you take her out first.

16:20.784 --> 16:22.319
You know why?

16:24.321 --> 16:26.254
Because you never
can trust a bitch.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.090
Is that a threat, Colonel?

16:29.693 --> 16:31.160
Just sharing.

16:33.430 --> 16:36.833
- You know why I think that is?
- No. Let's hear it.

16:39.368 --> 16:42.603
Because women always have to
work harder to prove themselves.

16:42.605 --> 16:44.706
Consequently, they
invariably become smarter

16:44.708 --> 16:47.207
and more dangerous than
their male counterparts.

16:47.209 --> 16:50.079
- Is that a threat, Doctor?
- Just sharing.

17:37.492 --> 17:39.358
Hey.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.795
Don't do that.

17:43.732 --> 17:45.567
Look, we need to see
if it's working.

17:47.636 --> 17:49.136
Please.

17:50.471 --> 17:52.807
You gotta keep taking it, okay?
Please.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.155
Sometimes I can hear the music.

HIV by fucking that rhesus monkey.

That was never proven.

28:05.434 --> 28:08.769
I got lot of rock 'n' roll, Pete.
You hear me?

28:09.471 --> 28:11.271
Do you hear me?

28:13.342 --> 28:16.511
Oh, okay. That feel good?
That feel nice?

28:16.744 --> 28:19.481
Yeah? Place of birth?

28:19.715 --> 28:21.516
- Minnesota.
- When did you turn?

28:21.749 --> 28:24.484
- Over a year ago, October.
- October? You sure?

28:24.486 --> 28:26.419
It was the day
before my birthday.

28:26.421 --> 28:28.988
- My wife bit me.
- Where?

28:28.990 --> 28:30.990
- At home.
- And where's home?

28:30.992 --> 28:32.260
Saint Paul.

28:36.230 --> 28:38.866
- You know anything about Patient Zero?
- Who?

28:39.799 --> 28:42.034
The first Infected.

28:42.036 --> 28:44.336
- You mean the original?
- The original, yeah.

28:44.338 --> 28:47.339
Do you know where he is?
You know where he is.

28:47.341 --> 28:49.073
You wanna listen to
some more music?

28:49.075 --> 28:52.010
Go ahead. Play your
fucking music.

28:52.012 --> 28:55.079
It didn't save your friend.
It won't save you.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.950
Nothing can save you.

29:10.130 --> 29:11.298
<b></b> <i>Morgan!</i>

29:24.311 --> 29:25.942
I don't blow your
brains out right now.

29:25.944 --> 29:27.144
You took my friend.

29:27.146 --> 29:28.548
My best friend in here.

29:28.782 --> 29:31.516
The only person who made me laugh
in this godforsaken world.

29:31.518 --> 29:34.918
Okay? You killed him. You
took him away from me.

29:34.920 --> 29:36.240
- <i>Morgan!</i>
- Where is Patient Zero?

29:36.264 --> 29:37.554
I can keep asking all day.

29:37.556 --> 29:39.591
Where is he? Where is he?

29:40.125 --> 29:41.327
Do it.

Do it.

29:45.564 --> 29:47.599
Do it. Do it.

29:48.434 --> 29:49.568
Do it.

29:52.137 --> 29:56.239
<b></font></b> <i>Both subjects were turned a year
and a half ago in Minnesota.</i>

29:56.241 --> 29:58.207
Which crucially leads
us to believe...

29:58.209 --> 30:02.211
So might one of them
be this Patient Zero?

30:02.213 --> 30:06.115
Uh, no, sir, both were
turned by another Infected,

30:06.117 --> 30:10.353
but Patient Zero could be a part
of this early Minnesota pack.

30:10.355 --> 30:13.055
What we need to do
is expand our search

30:13.057 --> 30:15.324
around the area where we
found both patients today.

30:15.326 --> 30:18.294
Why should we believe anything
one of them tells us?

30:18.296 --> 30:20.096
Because they don't lie, sir.

30:20.098 --> 30:22.338
Are you saying that they have
some sort of moral compass?

30:22.362 --> 30:25.698
No, sir, our studies tell us that
there is no such thing as deceit

30:25.869 --> 30:27.636
among the Infected.

30:27.638 --> 30:30.907
Their responses, though almost
always violent, are always truthful.

30:32.377 --> 30:33.942
Why is that?

30:33.944 --> 30:36.311
Well, we're still studying
their neural control center

30:36.313 --> 30:38.146
to determine that, sir,
but I can tell you...

30:38.148 --> 30:40.248
We can't risk any more soldiers

30:40.250 --> 30:42.484
on another low
percentage mission.

30:42.486 --> 30:44.185
That's what it all
boils down to.

30:44.187 --> 30:47.522
We cannot reverse-engineer a
vaccine without Patient Zero.

30:47.524 --> 30:49.023
And there's no
plan B, gentlemen.

30:49.025 --> 30:51.192
No Plan B doesn't mean
we have a good Plan A.

30:51.194 --> 30:52.927
I was right about Vegas.

30:52.929 --> 30:56.398
I gave Colonel Knox a report saying
that we're seeing more and more

30:56.400 --> 30:59.933
evolution in the adaptive and
strategic behavior of the Infected.

30:59.935 --> 31:03.371
It stated that as long as the
Vegas facility was exposed,

31:03.373 --> 31:04.851
then the Infected were
bound to find a way in.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.073
I dealt with it in the way
it was warranted, sir.

31:06.075 --> 31:07.635
Colonel Knox chose to
shelve the report.

31:07.637 --> 31:08.871
It was speculation at best.

31:08.873 --> 31:11.412
And it played out
exactly as I predicted.

31:11.414 --> 31:13.615
<b></b> This has nothing to do with
what we're talking about.

31:13.617 --> 31:15.817
This has everything to do with
what we're talking about.

31:15.841 --> 31:17.985
I keep trying to tell you,

31:17.987 --> 31:22.256
the Infected are not just sick
people suffering from a deficit.

31:22.258 --> 31:26.493
Something new, smart and
dangerous is evolving, sir.

31:26.495 --> 31:28.662
- They're learning.
<b></font></b>- They're learning, exactly.

31:28.664 --> 31:32.232
She's right, they're learning.
They're developing new strategies.

31:32.234 --> 31:34.554
- They're becoming more aware.
- Traveling in larger packs.

31:34.578 --> 31:36.969
Exactly. Like, how much longer
do you think it's gonna be

31:36.971 --> 31:39.542
until they realize that we're down here?
It's happening.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.247
Sir.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.685
You're right.

31:54.055 --> 31:55.988
It sounds like
actionable intel to me.

31:55.990 --> 31:59.091
- Oh, no. Respectfully, sir...
- She was right about Vegas.

31:59.093 --> 32:00.326
Thank you, sir.

32:00.328 --> 32:02.228
Thousands of people
died in that base,

32:02.230 --> 32:05.500
which is not something you should
be proud of being right about.

32:06.601 --> 32:09.100
What's Cheyenne got to say?

32:09.102 --> 32:10.670
Comm links with NORAD
and USNORTHCOM

32:10.672 --> 32:12.707
Alternate Command are
still down, sir.

32:12.941 --> 32:15.508
Dispatch squads for
thorough sweep.

32:15.510 --> 32:18.479
- Sir.
- Time is running out.

32:20.514 --> 32:22.216
Anderson.

32:24.685 --> 32:26.153
Pull the trigger.

32:29.022 --> 32:30.290
Good job.

32:32.292 --> 32:34.194
That guy is an asshole.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.493
We could have a
baby, me and you.

33:12.030 --> 33:14.632
Come on, Janet, what? You're not
gonna talk about this ever?

33:14.634 --> 33:17.133
Because I know how much
you want your own child.

33:17.135 --> 33:19.168
That's not true. I...

33:19.170 --> 33:21.504
I want a child with you.

33:21.506 --> 33:24.675
You know I love you for saying that.
But you know it is.

33:24.677 --> 33:29.078
You know, we agreed we'd wait until
we could afford a surrogate.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.581
Baby, there are so many kids
out there that need a home.

33:33.652 --> 33:35.485
- What? What are you...
- Eat your pad thai.

33:43.361 --> 33:45.229
<b></font></b>I heard gunshots earlier.

33:46.665 --> 33:48.733
Oh, no. That's nothing.

33:51.036 --> 33:52.702
It didn't sound like nothing.

33:52.704 --> 33:54.436
It's business as usual.

33:54.438 --> 33:56.358
Well, I don't know what
"business as usual" means

33:56.382 --> 33:58.140
because you never
tell me anything.

33:58.142 --> 34:00.777
Well, trust me, you don't wanna
know because it's ugly out there.

34:00.779 --> 34:02.411
It's uglier in here.

34:06.350 --> 34:09.117
You know how in the movies

34:09.119 --> 34:11.719
when there's an alien invasion,
everybody comes together

34:11.722 --> 34:13.755
to defeat a common enemy?

34:13.757 --> 34:15.657
It turns out real
life is a little more

34:15.659 --> 34:18.829
complicated than that, you know.

34:19.063 --> 34:24.197
Everybody wants to kill everybody
else for food or shelter.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.101
There's more that's complicated.

34:28.137 --> 34:29.739
Is it the doctor?

34:30.607 --> 34:32.408
I can sense it.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.380
She's pretty.

34:37.847 --> 34:40.313
Janet.

34:40.315 --> 34:43.353
You know, I took for granted the
simple things that made me human.

34:44.353 --> 34:45.786
Like tears.

34:45.788 --> 34:48.356
- Hey, you are everything to me.
- Not everything.

34:48.358 --> 34:50.658
- Baby, listen to me.
- I'm not your baby!

34:50.659 --> 34:53.259
- Hey. Janet.
- I'm one of them!

34:53.261 --> 34:56.196
I know you don't wanna hear
this, but when I was out there,

34:56.197 --> 34:57.900
I liked it.

34:58.133 --> 35:00.533
- The simplicity, the freedom.
- No. No.

35:00.535 --> 35:02.872
- The violence. You have to let me go.
- No.

35:03.138 --> 35:05.741
- Please, stay away from me. Please.
- No.

35:09.378 --> 35:11.511
You gotta promise me

35:11.513 --> 35:13.680
that you're not gonna give up.

35:13.682 --> 35:15.649
Because we are getting
somewhere here.

35:15.651 --> 35:17.352
The treatment is working.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.320
There's still hope.

35:20.322 --> 35:23.492
Don't you give up. Okay?

35:25.360 --> 35:26.828
And I love you.

35:35.436 --> 35:36.838
All right.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.175
W is for Waltz.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.377
Remember when we took
that ballroom dance class

35:45.379 --> 35:47.281
and fell all over each other?

36:02.563 --> 36:04.663
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No. Don't leave me.

36:04.665 --> 36:06.665
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Where did we leave off?

36:06.667 --> 36:09.902
Uh... What, it's R-S-T.
I think it's your turn.

36:09.904 --> 36:12.439
- T. T. T. T.
- Yeah, make it count.

36:13.406 --> 36:15.239
- You ready?
- Okay.

36:16.710 --> 36:18.878
- T is for tears.
- Okay.

36:21.481 --> 36:25.418
You make me so happy. I can't
remember the last time I cried.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.452
Oh.

36:27.454 --> 36:29.556
- It's good. It's good.
- Good. Good.

36:34.894 --> 36:36.361
<b></b> Tears.

36:36.963 --> 36:39.866
I miss my tears. I do...

36:42.534 --> 36:45.270
Maybe we should take a day
off the vampire routine.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.441
You look like shit.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.577
What? Thank you.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.346
I'm fine.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.681
What do the lab results say?

36:57.683 --> 36:59.850
We still don't know why
your blood is resistant.

36:59.852 --> 37:01.651
But the antibody drug conjugate

37:01.653 --> 37:03.920
is definitely lowering
Janet's viral load.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.455
Okay.

37:05.457 --> 37:08.026
It's slowing down the infection,
even easing the rage.

37:08.794 --> 37:09.995
Okay, good.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.531
But, uh, only temporarily. Look.

37:19.804 --> 37:23.606
That rat was treated with our
latest vaccine from your blood.

37:23.608 --> 37:26.043
It was only five minutes in.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.744
Well, the guy's
behind you, still.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.480
Well, he looks like an
asshole, for a rat.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.855
What I'm trying to tell you is,

37:38.956 --> 37:41.489
basically, we're still
far off the vaccine.

37:41.491 --> 37:44.394
A vaccine will prevent
further infection, but...

37:45.730 --> 37:47.890
Morgan, you gotta start
listening to me when I tell you

37:47.914 --> 37:50.116
that there's no guarantee
that I can bring Janet back.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.467
Don't. Not this.

37:52.469 --> 37:54.502
- You're not listening to me.
- Please, don't.

37:54.504 --> 37:57.374
I don't need it, okay. Not today.
Give me a break.

37:59.509 --> 38:00.610
Okay?

38:06.983 --> 38:09.751
- I feel how you touch me.
- Gina...

38:09.753 --> 38:11.588
I can see how you look at me.

38:15.324 --> 38:17.992
I love you, Morgan.

38:17.994 --> 38:20.831
I love that you still love her.
I do.

38:22.065 --> 38:23.797
But it's time for you to let go.

38:23.799 --> 38:26.700
Whoa, whoa. Don't tell me what
it's time for me to do, okay?

38:26.702 --> 38:28.769
That is not your place.
Just back the fuck up

38:28.771 --> 38:31.073

God damn it.

38:32.708 --> 38:36.745

- What kind of professor?
- Doesn't say.

45:58.741 --> 46:01.143
- Um... Be careful.
- I will.

46:02.311 --> 46:04.012
You know, I love this song.

46:13.422 --> 46:15.221
You wanted to speak with me?

46:15.223 --> 46:17.923
I wanted to see if the
rumors were true.

46:17.925 --> 46:19.992
The rumors. Oh, well.

46:19.994 --> 46:23.531
I didn't realize I was so popular.
How do you know about me?

46:23.766 --> 46:27.568
Well, you know us Infected.
We just love to gossip.

46:28.369 --> 46:29.535
So you were a professor?

46:29.537 --> 46:31.270
By passion and trade.

46:31.272 --> 46:33.239
Do you remember anything
about your human life?

46:33.241 --> 46:34.340
Do you remember teaching?

46:34.342 --> 46:37.008
Of course. Don't you?

46:37.010 --> 46:39.110
Well, I mean, how do
you know I was a...

46:39.112 --> 46:41.382
Mmm. Like I said, word travels.
What subject?

46:45.319 --> 46:47.520
- Biology. I gave it up.
- Yes.

46:47.522 --> 46:51.122
I would have to if I had to teach a
bunch of high school Neanderthals.

46:51.124 --> 46:53.260
Hey, don't hate on the kids.</font></b>

46:54.361 --> 46:57.862
No, no, no. Thank you. I quit.

46:57.864 --> 47:01.066
Good for you. I, however,
am a lifetime smoker.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.270
Oh! That'll get you
in the end, you know.

47:05.105 --> 47:07.307
Okay, so when were you infected?

47:10.210 --> 47:12.379
Oh, here we go. When
were you infected?

47:13.913 --> 47:15.582
When were you infected?

47:19.085 --> 47:23.053
When were you infected? No?
You don't wanna play?

47:23.055 --> 47:25.816
This is how you wanna play? You wanna
play nice? You wanna play rough?

47:26.325 --> 47:28.125
No, look, I got all
day, all night.

47:28.127 --> 47:30.361
Funnily enough, I got nowhere
that I need to be tonight,

47:30.363 --> 47:32.129
so it's only a matter of time.

47:32.131 --> 47:36.202
Trust me, young man, time's a
luxury that you cannot afford.

47:42.107 --> 47:44.941
- So, the music doesn't bother you?
- No.

47:44.943 --> 47:46.310
Is it supposed to?

47:46.312 --> 47:48.144
Well, it has with every
other Infected, yeah.

47:48.146 --> 47:52.081
So because of the behavior of a
few, you assume we're all the same?

47:52.083 --> 47:53.983
Just an observation.
Broad observation.

47:53.985 --> 47:56.419
It doesn't take
individuality into account.

47:56.421 --> 47:58.554
Oh, excuse me. So each
Infected is different?

47:58.556 --> 48:00.323
Yes, well, why wouldn't we be?

48:00.325 --> 48:02.592
Each uninfected is different.

48:02.594 --> 48:05.395
Look at you. You were bitten.

48:05.397 --> 48:07.230
The virus altered
you enough so that

48:07.232 --> 48:09.399
you could communicate
with us and yet,

48:09.401 --> 48:11.669
you're still not
really one of us.

48:13.171 --> 48:14.439
Are you?

48:15.507 --> 48:17.442
No, I'm not one of you.

48:21.011 --> 48:22.445
Anyway, back to business.

48:22.447 --> 48:24.246
You wanna tell me
about Patient Zero?

48:24.248 --> 48:25.650
Why would I answer
your questions?

48:25.884 --> 48:28.150
And even if I did, why would
I answer them honestly?

48:28.152 --> 48:31.119
Because I'm asking so nicely,
and I know that you can't lie.

48:31.121 --> 48:34.055
- Oh, is that so?
- I believe it to be so.

48:34.057 --> 48:36.297
I mean, at least that is my
understanding of your nature.

48:36.321 --> 48:38.456
Oh, that is your
understanding of my nature?

48:39.463 --> 48:40.996
That's quite precious.

48:40.998 --> 48:42.997
Believe me, I've seen a
lot of you come and go.

48:42.999 --> 48:45.200
A lot, but not all.

48:45.202 --> 48:47.169
Well, so you're the anomaly.

48:47.171 --> 48:50.272
Well, I do like to think
of myself as special.

48:54.343 --> 48:56.145
Don't you believe in exceptions?

48:57.213 --> 49:00.114
I do believe in exceptions.

49:00.116 --> 49:01.951
- Go ahead. Please explain.
- I...

49:05.655 --> 49:07.490
This should be quite good.

49:10.059 --> 49:11.625
Free will, Professor.

49:11.627 --> 49:14.328
I believe you lost that
capacity when you were turned.

49:14.330 --> 49:16.397
Oh, I see.

49:16.399 --> 49:20.099
So, you're postulating that because I'm no
longer human, that I don't have free will.

49:20.101 --> 49:23.471
And yet, here I am conversing
with you, enjoying a smoke.

49:23.473 --> 49:25.641
These are hardly the traits
one would associate with

49:26.709 --> 49:28.642
an animal.

49:28.644 --> 49:33.112
In fact, I would argue that we're
a more evolved species than you.

49:33.114 --> 49:36.182
An evolved species that destroys
without any conscience.

49:36.184 --> 49:39.619
Yes, just like humans, who destroy
chickens and cows without a conscience.

49:39.621 --> 49:42.155
No, no, come on, man, that's
food, that's sustenance.

49:42.157 --> 49:44.459
What do you think
violence is for us?

49:50.499 --> 49:52.567
You wanna tell me how
you became infected?

50:03.511 --> 50:06.646
I was teaching a class
the day it happened.

50:06.648 --> 50:09.481
I had just started a lecture
on medieval philosophy.

50:09.483 --> 50:14.553
St. Augustine says that man must
love because he is incomplete.

50:14.555 --> 50:17.222
Loving is an act of good.

50:17.224 --> 50:22.160
A unique human ability, granted
as a gift from a higher power.

50:22.162 --> 50:26.032
In St. Augustine's
<i>Doctrine of Love,</i>

50:29.202 --> 50:32.372
he states that... Um...</font></b>

50:36.242 --> 50:40.712
"To not love is
to be incomplete,

50:40.714 --> 50:46.486
"to not love is to not
be human." Excuse me.

50:49.122 --> 50:51.656
Hello. Hello.

50:51.658 --> 50:54.392
Yeah. Hi, honey, look, I can't
talk right now, all right?

50:54.394 --> 50:56.126
- I'm busy...
<b></font></b>- <i>People are being attacked.</i>

50:56.128 --> 50:57.628
- What?
- <i>You gotta come home.</i>

50:57.630 --> 51:00.464
- <i>I'm really scared.</i>
- Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

51:00.466 --> 51:02.700
- <i>I hear screams.</i>
- What's happening?

51:04.504 --> 51:07.024
Wait, honey, look, I'll call you back.
I'll call you right back.

51:18.517 --> 51:21.384
Help me. Help me, please.</font></b>

51:21.386 --> 51:23.553
<b></font></b>- Hurry, come on.
<b></font></b>- I'm coming.

51:23.555 --> 51:26.256
Oh, my God, what's going on?

51:50.247 --> 51:52.149
<b></font></b> <i>What happened to your family?</i>

51:53.417 --> 51:56.120
<b></font></b>- <i>What?</i>
<b></font></b>- <i>Your family?</i>

52:01.292 --> 52:03.859
- My family?
<b></font></b>- Yeah.

52:03.861 --> 52:05.396
You know what happened to them?

52:09.100 --> 52:11.334
When the virus takes
over your body,

52:13.169 --> 52:14.905
it's like...

52:17.540 --> 52:19.875
Every nerve has
been stretched...

52:19.877 --> 52:21.511
<i>Help!</i> <b></b>

52:22.379 --> 52:24.614
Sliced with broken glass,

52:26.616 --> 52:28.451
and doused in vinegar.

52:31.788 --> 52:34.789
But even in the
throes of this pain,

52:34.791 --> 52:37.327
I was driven by one
compelling thought.

52:41.330 --> 52:43.265
I needed to see my family.

52:45.467 --> 52:47.501
<b></font></b> <i>Please leave your
message after the tone.</i>

52:48.604 --> 52:50.437

Look, I saw the news. Please call
me back as soon as you can, okay?

52:53.242 --> 52:54.810
I love you.

53:05.487 --> 53:07.256
Oh, thank God. You're safe.

53:09.458 --> 53:11.892
Honey, you're safe.</font></b>

53:11.894 --> 53:14.596
I tried calling my mother but
all the circuits are busy...

53:18.734 --> 53:20.201
Honey...

53:22.171 --> 53:23.471
What's the matter?

53:34.549 --> 53:36.415
<b></font></b> <i>I tore my wife's
limbs from her torso</i>

53:36.417 --> 53:38.352
<i>like wings from a butterfly.</i>

53:40.288 --> 53:42.588
<i>She begged me to stop.</i>

53:42.590 --> 53:44.425
<i>And cried out my name.</i>

53:45.393 --> 53:47.895
<i>But I couldn't until</i>

53:48.730 --> 53:50.497
<i>I ripped out her heart.</i>

53:52.566 --> 53:53.801
Daddy?

54:04.644 --> 54:07.948
I wanted to tell her that I
was no longer her daddy.

54:13.220 --> 54:15.355
You're a goddamn animal.

54:19.425 --> 54:21.025
Between the humans
and The Infected,

54:21.027 --> 54:23.762
who do you think is on the top
of the evolutionary scale?

54:23.764 --> 54:26.332
- Not you.
- See, I beg to differ.

54:27.901 --> 54:30.601
Our brains have been
enhanced by the virus.

54:30.603 --> 54:35.508
Therefore freeing us from the
limitations of what you call human.

54:53.893 --> 54:56.894
- Where is Patient Zero?
- Oh, there is none.

54:56.896 --> 54:58.831
The virus started
somewhere, where is he?

55:00.266 --> 55:01.430
The rage.

55:01.432 --> 55:06.435
The rage started here
against the government.

55:06.437 --> 55:10.673
The rich, the poor, foreigners,
intellectuals, conservatives,

55:10.675 --> 55:13.545
feminists, freaks, name it.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.412
- That's where it came from.
- Shut up.

55:16.414 --> 55:20.883
We became so angry for so many
good reasons, and for none.

55:20.885 --> 55:23.953
The virus has laid dormant in
us since the beginning of time.

55:23.955 --> 55:26.055
- Shut up.
- And the extremes of modern stress

55:26.057 --> 55:27.757
- have caused it to awaken.
- Shut up.

55:27.759 --> 55:30.592
- We're all, in essence, Patient Zero.
- Shut up. Shut up.

55:30.594 --> 55:32.931
Shut up, goddamn it!

55:34.032 --> 55:35.865
See?

55:35.867 --> 55:37.701
We're not that
different, are we?

55:48.679 --> 55:54.015
- What on Earth's he saying to you?
- Sorry, he's debating with me.

55:54.017 --> 55:56.818
<b></font></b>- He's a fucking Infected.
- Yeah, I know.

55:56.820 --> 55:59.054
Do you need a minute?

55:59.056 --> 56:03.457
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm sorry, the...

56:03.459 --> 56:05.859
- I shouldn't have hit him.
- No, you shouldn't have hit him.

56:05.861 --> 56:07.701
- He's being an asshole.
- Don't hit him again.

56:07.725 --> 56:09.663
- I won't.
- Don't let him get to you.

56:09.665 --> 56:10.968
Go in there and take control.

56:16.572 --> 56:18.441
Actually, I will bum that smoke.

56:19.475 --> 56:21.010
Thank you.</font></b>

56:29.719 --> 56:31.517
How long have you been married?

56:31.519 --> 56:33.055
Is that a question?

56:34.824 --> 56:36.824
It's nice to be in
love though, isn't it?

56:36.826 --> 56:38.524
What, you gonna lecture
me about love now?

56:38.526 --> 56:39.646
What do you know about love?

56:40.795 --> 56:42.096
Just because I killed my family,

56:42.098 --> 56:43.598
doesn't mean I didn't love them.

56:51.806 --> 56:53.174
Thanks.

56:56.878 --> 56:58.146
How's your wife?

56:59.814 --> 57:00.880
Fine.

57:00.882 --> 57:01.983
Is she?

57:04.653 --> 57:06.587
No, she's not. Thank
you for asking.

57:09.724 --> 57:12.493
I don't know if my wife's
a human being anymore.

57:13.995 --> 57:15.696
That's how she is.

57:19.100 --> 57:20.799
I remember why I quit.

57:24.772 --> 57:27.606
So that's why you're so interested
in finding Patient Zero.

57:27.608 --> 57:29.074
No, it's because
you're a disease.

57:29.076 --> 57:31.109
A disease that I
believe can be cured.

57:31.111 --> 57:33.679
- Do I look sick to you?
- Yes.

57:33.681 --> 57:37.217
<b></b> I don't think that
we're the disease.

57:37.483 --> 57:42.120
I think that human beings are the
disease, and we're the cure.

57:42.122 --> 57:44.959
The antidote that has
been given to Earth

57:46.793 --> 57:48.761
to get rid of the
human infection.

57:52.632 --> 57:54.072
How are those headaches
treating you?

57:54.096 --> 57:56.934
Oh, fine and dandy, thank you.

57:56.936 --> 57:59.172
I know more about you than
you know about yourself.

58:02.709 --> 58:08.511
Those headaches, that's the rage
inside you, yearning to escape.

58:08.513 --> 58:10.883
Thank you for the
educational talk.

58:12.651 --> 58:15.186
But we are at war here.

58:15.188 --> 58:20.259
If we're at war, I suggest you
ask yourself who's winning.

58:20.492 --> 58:22.492
Oh, you think you're winning?
Hey, let me tell you.

58:22.516 --> 58:25.895
However slight the human race may
be, we will continue to fight.

58:25.897 --> 58:27.897
We will continue
to remain curious.

58:27.899 --> 58:31.067
We will continue to find solutions
and we will continue to adapt

58:31.069 --> 58:32.669
because that is what we do,

58:32.671 --> 58:35.005
and that is what we have done
since the dawn of time, okay?

58:35.007 --> 58:37.807
What, you see me rub my head,
you see me pop some pills,

58:37.809 --> 58:40.610
and from that you figure out
I got chronic headaches?

58:40.612 --> 58:44.981
Geez, Columbo, like you
noticed the tan line

58:44.983 --> 58:47.117
around my ring finger
and from that you

58:47.119 --> 58:49.252
figure out that I was
married, so what?

58:49.254 --> 58:51.154
<b><font face="Rockwell" color="#D900D9">You've been playing me.

58:51.156 --> 58:52.956
You've been playing
tricks on me.

Playing tricks like the way you
Trojan horsed yourself in here.

58:55.559 --> 58:58.128
You know, you claim that
you wanted to talk to me,

58:58.130 --> 58:59.561
and that's what
we've been doing,

58:59.563 --> 59:01.597
we've been talking, and talking,

59:01.599 --> 59:05.200
and talking. We've been going around,
and around, and around in circles

59:05.202 --> 59:07.569
not talking about
anything specific.

59:07.571 --> 59:09.774
No, no, no. It's just
random bullshit.

59:11.675 --> 59:13.543
You're wasting my goddamn time.

59:16.881 --> 59:19.081
Time.

59:19.083 --> 59:21.252
Time which you claim
that I don't have.

59:30.094 --> 59:33.164
Gina, can you bring me your
frequency detector, like, now?

59:41.037 --> 59:42.739
What's going on?

59:43.973 --> 59:46.042
You think he's
transmitting a signal?

59:48.912 --> 59:50.612
I don't know.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.188
Morgan?

Just like the professor.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.776
This whole goddamn
thing was a setup.

01:00:22.778 --> 01:00:25.848
Jesus Christ. You wanted it,
you wanted to be captured.

01:00:27.715 --> 01:00:30.885
Yeah, I know, and now I'm gonna
make you talk, motherfucker.

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.988

Hey, hey, security. Open gate 23.
Security.

Go!</font></b>

<b></font></b>- You sure?
<b></font></b>- Watch our six.

01:00:56.643 --> 01:00:59.345
Knife. Knife. I need a knife.

01:00:59.347 --> 01:01:00.948
<b></font></b> Here you go.

01:01:29.342 --> 01:01:31.342
<b></font></b> It was definitely
sending out a signal.

But who the hell put the tracking
device in this Pete Townshend?

I don't know, sir. A smart, a
strategically advanced Infected.

01:01:37.983 --> 01:01:41.419
He said it. The guy I was interviewing.
Professor Asshole.

01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:43.120
You know, they know about me.

01:01:43.122 --> 01:01:44.222
They know what we're
trying to do here.

01:01:44.224 --> 01:01:45.856
They know that we're
trying to stop them.

01:01:45.858 --> 01:01:47.358
But they don't
know where we are.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.294
So, they planted a tracking
device in Pete Townshend

01:01:50.296 --> 01:01:52.162
and The Infected are
now tracking us.

01:01:52.164 --> 01:01:53.931
- They know we're here.
- Jesus.

01:01:55.434 --> 01:01:57.401
Knox.

Well, where are they now?

01:01:59.138 --> 01:02:01.258
- New body bags coming in from the field.
- Body bags?

01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:03.417
Make sure no one gets in
or out of this facility.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.895

You're right.

Put the gun down, you
