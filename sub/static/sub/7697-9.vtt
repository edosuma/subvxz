WEBVTT

01:20.955 --> 01:22.373
The prisoner will stand.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.752
Pamela Lillian Isley,

01:27.086 --> 01:29.130
District Attorney Van Dam has asked

01:29.213 --> 01:32.425
that the maximum sentence of life
imprisonment be imposed upon you.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.928
However, as your apprehension came
at the hands of the Batman,

01:36.095 --> 01:38.014
and not a recognized agent of the law,

01:38.097 --> 01:42.351
this court has no choice
but to return you to Arkham Asylum,

01:42.435 --> 01:45.896
where it is hoped you will complete
your rehabilitation.

01:54.905 --> 01:57.450
Hi, Red. Hi. Welcome home.

01:59.785 --> 02:00.828
Hi, Harley.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.183
Aw, things didn't go too good, huh?

02:22.642 --> 02:24.518
- Nope.
- Well, cheer up.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.146
Word is we're gonna throw
a little party.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.815
And old Jervis here has the invitations.

02:35.696 --> 02:39.575
<i>Not only does Batman create
these so-called super-criminals,</i>

02:39.867 --> 02:42.745
<i>he takes it upon himself
to be their judge and jury</i>

02:42.828 --> 02:44.955
<i>with no regard for the legal system.</i>

02:45.289 --> 02:47.833
<i>It sounds like
you want to put Batman on trial.</i>

02:48.000 --> 02:50.086
<i>Believe me, I'd like nothing better.</i>

02:51.629 --> 02:54.382
- Strong words.
- It's got to stop, Jim.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.384
As Gotham's new district attorney,

02:56.467 --> 03:00.096
I can't allow your pet nut
to run loose in my city.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.430
I mean it.

03:01.889 --> 03:05.101
Janet, it's a war zone out there,
and Batman is our best weapon.

03:05.434 --> 03:10.481
And I say he's a drug the city keeps
taking to avoid facing reality.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.111
Speak of the devil.

03:15.444 --> 03:18.823
The East Side Skulls are ready
to declare war on the other gangs.

03:18.989 --> 03:20.825
Old news. My department's already

03:20.908 --> 03:22.910
planning a sting to catch
the Skulls' leader.

03:22.993 --> 03:24.245
Don't bother.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.623
Very cute, mister.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.291
You want to support law and order?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.585
You take off that mask
and put on a uniform.

03:35.339 --> 03:38.384
You hear me, Batman?
This is the last time!

03:41.220 --> 03:44.765
The next time I see him,
it will be a whole different story.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.483
Hello, Bruce.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.862
Janet, I'm so glad we're able to meet
on such short notice.

03:59.321 --> 04:02.199
It seems every place I look
there's our crusading DA

04:02.283 --> 04:04.618
leading the campaign
to rid our city of Batman.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.873
Oh, please. He's the last person
I want to talk about tonight.

04:09.790 --> 04:10.791
Oh, sorry.

04:11.292 --> 04:14.211
Still, even you have to admit
Batman's come through now and then.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.589
But look at the lunatic fringe
he's created.

04:16.672 --> 04:19.300
The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy,
and the rest.

04:19.383 --> 04:21.343
Batman's responsible
for every one of them.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.096
Excuse me, Ms. Van Dam,
but your office just called.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.015
They said it's an emergency.

04:26.098 --> 04:28.225
I'm sorry, Bruce. I won't be a minute.

04:31.979 --> 04:33.063
Take your time.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.409
Uh, excuse me,
have you seen Ms. Van Dam?

04:45.868 --> 04:47.995
- Not in the last half-hour, sir.
- Look.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.872
Must be trouble.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.168
- Look at that.
- I've never seen that before.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.801
It's Van Dorn's.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.512
It was dropped on the front desk
20 minutes ago.

05:05.262 --> 05:06.305
Along with this.

05:08.265 --> 05:11.936
"Batman, come alone to where
lives hang in the balance

05:12.019 --> 05:13.979
"or the law in Gotham dies."

05:25.449 --> 05:27.409
You there! Come into the light.

05:29.161 --> 05:30.204
I said...

05:56.355 --> 05:58.065
Oh, no, you don't.

06:00.442 --> 06:01.819
Ta-da!

06:14.164 --> 06:16.500
Let me out. Do you hear me?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.836
Whoever you are, let me out this second.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.510
Welcome to Arkham, Van Dam.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.178
Two-Face.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.640
Don't bother screaming for help.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.018
The white coats can't hear you.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.480
Matter of fact,
they can't do much of anything,

06:38.856 --> 06:40.691
thanks to the Mad Hatter.

06:44.236 --> 06:45.446
You're going to escape?

06:45.946 --> 06:47.114
Eventually.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.701
We've got some legal business
to settle first.

06:51.118 --> 06:54.914
- What do you mean?
- I'm talking about a trial.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.291
Me, the prosecutor.

06:57.958 --> 06:59.335
You, the defense.

06:59.835 --> 07:01.337
And your client...

07:04.340 --> 07:06.258
Is Batman.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.144
This is insane. Me defending you?

07:17.227 --> 07:19.730
As far as I'm concerned,
you belong in here with them.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.441
Whatever.

07:22.775 --> 07:26.111
You've gotta go through with it.
It's their game and their rules.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.822
Let's go. Move it.

07:29.281 --> 07:30.449
Indeed.

07:30.824 --> 07:32.743
Can't keep the judge waiting.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.455
You've said it yourself, lady.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.083
Batman made every one of us.

07:39.249 --> 07:43.796
So, we're placing him before the bar
to face our justice.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.130
And me?

07:45.547 --> 07:47.383
Basic 50/50 option.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.636
You get him off. You both go free.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.805
He goes down,

07:53.347 --> 07:55.182
you take the fall with him.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.226
Amusing idea, what?

07:57.309 --> 08:00.020
Kidnapping you to be Batman's attorney?

08:00.437 --> 08:03.691
Personally, I suggested a quick slug
between the eyes.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.317
But I lost the coin toss.

08:30.134 --> 08:34.138
I borrowed your belt, Bats,
but it doesn't do a thing for me.

08:35.723 --> 08:36.890
Sit down.

08:44.898 --> 08:47.109
Oyez. Oyez.

08:49.486 --> 08:53.073
He says, "Oyez," dirt bags! Dummy up.

08:53.532 --> 08:54.533
Sheesh!

08:54.616 --> 08:56.285
I gotta do everything for you.

08:56.785 --> 08:58.662
Court is now in session.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.206
The good people of Arkham Asylum

09:01.290 --> 09:05.586
versus the self-righteous vigilante
called Batman.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.047
Our prosecutor is ready.

09:08.297 --> 09:12.634
Likewise, our fair and impartial jury.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.428
- Hang him.
- Shoot him.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.055
Hit him with a rock.

09:17.306 --> 09:22.061
And now all rise for the most honorable,
most benevolent, most merciful

09:22.269 --> 09:24.188
Judge Joker.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.903
Guilty!

09:32.071 --> 09:34.990
I was promised a chance
to defend my client.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.909
Oh, very well.

09:37.242 --> 09:38.994
Like it'll make a difference.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.915
Mr. Prosecutor,
make your opening statement.

09:48.837 --> 09:49.963
Look at us.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.800
We're all freaks and monsters.

09:53.383 --> 09:54.968
And who made us this way?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.054
Batman.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.363
Go on, lady. Defend him if you can.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.073
Call the first witness.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.700
Yo, Hat. On the stand.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.418
Proceed, counselor.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.050
I suppose you, like your friends,

10:35.134 --> 10:37.636
claim that Batman
drove you to be a criminal?

10:37.719 --> 10:38.929
He did.

10:39.346 --> 10:41.974
And yet, as I recall your case,

10:42.057 --> 10:45.686
you brainwashed and kidnapped
a woman who rejected you.

10:45.769 --> 10:47.312
Batman forced me to do it.

10:47.479 --> 10:50.566
He was going to take her away from me.
I had no choice.

10:50.899 --> 10:54.111
You could have respected her wishes
and left her alone.

10:54.194 --> 10:55.737
I'd have killed her first!

10:56.738 --> 10:57.739
Ooh.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.284
I'd like that last statement
stricken from the record, please.

11:00.868 --> 11:04.163
Record? Is someone supposed
to be writing this down?

11:05.581 --> 11:08.125
This is crazy.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.211
That's beside the point.
Just keep it going.

11:16.717 --> 11:20.762
Looks like Batman's hunch was wrong.
There's no sign of him or Ms. Van Dam.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.598
But he was here, all right.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.350
I object to this witness.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.853
She's obviously trying
to influence the judge.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.067
- What makes you say that?
- Never mind.

11:34.359 --> 11:35.611
Do you have a statement?

11:35.694 --> 11:39.323
I just wanna say,
if there was no Batman,

11:39.406 --> 11:40.991
there'd be no Joker.

11:41.074 --> 11:44.077
And I'd never have met my pudding.

11:45.078 --> 11:46.997
Thank you, Batman.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.292
Sad, isn't it?

11:50.459 --> 11:53.128
Harleen Quinzel was a doctor
here at Arkham

11:53.212 --> 11:55.255
until the Joker twisted her mind.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.342
Ha! You're just jealous
because you don't have a fella

11:58.425 --> 12:02.888
who's as loving and loyal to you
as my pudding is to me.

12:06.391 --> 12:07.392
Uh-huh.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.479
And I suppose it was
that same loyalty I saw

12:10.562 --> 12:13.232
the last time you escaped,
and pudding here...

12:14.358 --> 12:16.860
Finked on you
in hopes of getting time off.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.365
Is that true, pudding?

12:23.116 --> 12:25.827
"Finked" is such an ugly word.

12:26.703 --> 12:29.373
You lousy scum-sucking creep!

12:29.456 --> 12:32.251
The witness is excused.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.545
Slimy rat!

12:40.759 --> 12:42.386
Knock it off, lady.

12:44.721 --> 12:47.307
I'II kick that grin off your silly face.

12:51.144 --> 12:54.523
And so it's Batman's fault
you lead a life of crime.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.567
He should have let me bump off
Harvey Dent.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.946
We'd all have been better off,
wouldn't we, Harv?

13:01.488 --> 13:03.448
Why, you rotten little...

13:03.532 --> 13:04.825
But, Ms. Isley,

13:05.117 --> 13:07.411
isn't the real motivation
for your crimes

13:07.494 --> 13:08.954
your obsession with plants?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.831
That you prefer them to people?

13:10.914 --> 13:14.918
I love plants, honey,
but a rose is a rose.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.587
Then it doesn't bother you when someone,

13:17.671 --> 13:21.008
let's say the judge here,
ruthlessly plucks

13:21.258 --> 13:26.096
a defenseless flower
from the warm green earth?

13:26.179 --> 13:27.222
No-

13:27.306 --> 13:30.100
Even knowing he's given it
his death sentence?

13:30.642 --> 13:32.394
That its petals must die?

13:32.811 --> 13:34.938
- Stop it.
- One by one.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.523
Withering, falling.

13:36.690 --> 13:41.069
One by one, until it's all gone. Honey.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.744
Ms. Ivy, please.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.915
You're beautiful when you're angry.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.808
I used to believe Batman
was responsible for you people.

14:11.933 --> 14:15.604
But now I see nearly everyone here
would've ended up exactly the same,

14:15.687 --> 14:16.897
Batman or not.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.732
Oh, the gimmicks might be different.

14:18.815 --> 14:23.111
But you'd all be out there in some form
or another, bringing misery to Gotham.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.365
The truth is you created him.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.911
It's working.

14:31.536 --> 14:33.205
Looks like a tracking device.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.749
It's pointing north.

14:36.249 --> 14:37.501
The Somerset District.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.419
Nothing much out there except...

14:40.379 --> 14:41.505
Arkham.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.890
Jury, you've heard the evidence.

14:52.182 --> 14:54.267
Consider your verdict.

15:03.693 --> 15:08.365
Your Honor, in light
of Ms. Van Dorn's stirring defense,

15:08.740 --> 15:11.952
we have no choice
but to find the defendant...

15:13.912 --> 15:14.996
Not guilty.

15:19.668 --> 15:20.752
Amazing.

15:25.173 --> 15:26.967
Well done, counselor.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.345
You've proven that Batman
didn't create us.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.974
That we, in fact,
messed up our own rotten lives.

15:34.766 --> 15:38.562
And as we are so rotten,
vile and depraved,

15:38.937 --> 15:41.982
we're going to waste you anyway.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.290
That's all, folks.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.125
Let's mambo.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.617
Help us! Please!

17:01.770 --> 17:03.230
Let me go.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.026
Anything you say, Jannie-poo.

17:19.454 --> 17:22.165
And now
for the final confession.

17:22.249 --> 17:26.378
The big secret you've kept from us
for so many years.

17:26.461 --> 17:29.881
Brothers and sisters,
at long last, I give you

17:29.965 --> 17:32.509
the man behind the bat.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.606
What?

17:52.529 --> 17:53.697
- What's going on?
- He's gone.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.367
Everyone, spread out.
Don't let him get away.

17:57.909 --> 17:59.744
Who says I'm leaving?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.083
What's going on?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.585
Get the light.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.925
Nobody panic.

18:18.930 --> 18:21.266
Okay, start panicking.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.355
The only way out is through me.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.823
Hold on. You'll hit Croc.

18:36.906 --> 18:38.366
What's your point?

18:56.968 --> 18:59.137
Watch where
you're shooting, clown.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.479
I'm hit, boys!

20:23.722 --> 20:24.848
Hold it.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.767
Nobody move.

20:33.231 --> 20:36.067
Yoo-hoo! Look alive, Batman.

20:37.944 --> 20:39.946
Here comes the judge.

20:47.996 --> 20:51.166
Old Hanging Judge Joker, that's me.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.453
I see now there's a need
for the things you do.

21:29.954 --> 21:33.458
