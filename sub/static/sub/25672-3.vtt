<font size="20"><b>{\an8}"Old Story"</b></font>

01:36.530 --> 01:42.160
<font size="20"><b>I was born on a small farm in
the northern region of Wall Rose.</b></font>

01:42.160 --> 01:45.620
<font size="20"><b>It was on land owned by
the noble family of Reiss.</b></font>

01:48.670 --> 01:53.800
<font size="20"><b>As far back as I can remember,
I was helping around the farm.</b></font>

01:57.010 --> 02:03.180
<font size="20"><b>But, my mother was always reading books
and not once did I see her doing housework.</b></font>

02:03.180 --> 02:05.560
<font size="20"><b>She was a beautiful woman...</b></font>

02:07.480 --> 02:10.650
<font size="20"><b>At night, someone would
come for her in a wagon...</b></font>

02:10.650 --> 02:14.780
<font size="20"><b>...and she'd go off to
the city wearing fancy clothes.</b></font>

02:15.860 --> 02:19.110
<font size="20"><b>For me, that was just life as I knew it.</b></font>

02:21.660 --> 02:27.540
<font size="20"><b>After I learned to read and write,
I picked up a book to imitate my mother.</b></font>

02:27.540 --> 02:31.000
<font size="20"><b>Only then did I know how alone I was.</b></font>

02:32.170 --> 02:36.010
<font size="20"><b>In all the books, parents cared
about their children.</b></font>

02:36.010 --> 02:40.590
<font size="20"><b>They talked, hugged, fought...
or so the stories went.</b></font>

02:41.720 --> 02:45.060
<font size="20"><b>I had never experienced any of those things.</b></font>

02:46.180 --> 02:51.900
<font size="20"><b>One day, out of curiosity,
I decided to try hugging my mother.</b></font>

02:51.900 --> 02:55.090
<font size="20"><b>I just wanted to see what
kind of face she would make.</b></font>

02:55.940 --> 02:57.190
<font size="20"><b>Mother!</b></font>

03:03.120 --> 03:09.000
<font size="20"><b>She ended up shoving me away, but that was
the first thing my mother ever did to me.</b></font>

03:11.170 --> 03:13.250
<font size="20"><b>That's why it made me so happy.</b></font>

03:15.960 --> 03:20.420
<font size="20"><b>If only I had the courage...
to kill the girl...</b></font>

03:24.090 --> 03:28.220
<font size="20"><b>Those were... the first words
my mother said to me.</b></font>

03:29.560 --> 03:34.940
<font size="20"><b>After that, she left the house
and began living somewhere else.</b></font>

03:36.480 --> 03:42.580
<font size="20"><b>And then, five years ago...
One night just days after Wall Maria fell...</b></font>

03:42.990 --> 03:45.550
<font size="20"><b>For the very first time, I met my father.</b></font>

03:46.830 --> 03:49.830
<font size="20"><b>Nice to meet you, Historia.</b></font>

03:49.830 --> 03:53.620
<font size="20"><b>My name is Rod Reiss... I'm your father.</b></font>

03:54.830 --> 03:59.380
<font size="20"><b>That man... He was the lord
ruling the land we lived on.</b></font>

04:00.550 --> 04:04.890
<font size="20"><b>My mother I hadn't seen in years
looked terribly frightened.</b></font>

04:06.010 --> 04:09.690
<font size="20"><b>Historia... You'll be living with me now.</b></font>

04:17.899 --> 04:19.860
<font size="20"><b>This is a problem, Lord Reiss.</b></font>

04:20.529 --> 04:23.240
<font size="20"><b>Let's avoid acting rashly now.</b></font>

04:23.650 --> 04:27.740
<font size="20"><b>Did the fall of Wall Maria
make you a little scared?</b></font>

04:28.580 --> 04:29.830
<font size="20"><b>Mother!</b></font>

04:29.830 --> 04:33.330
<font size="20"><b>No! I am not the mother of that girl!</b></font>

04:33.330 --> 04:36.210
<font size="20"><b>She has nothing to do with me!</b></font>

04:37.500 --> 04:41.300
<font size="20"><b>Oh? Is that true, Lord Reiss?</b></font>

04:41.300 --> 04:45.680
<font size="20"><b>Do you really have nothing to do
with this woman or child?</b></font>

04:52.430 --> 04:53.730
<font size="20"><b>So be it...</b></font>

04:55.560 --> 04:58.730
<font size="20"><b>These two here have nothing to do with me.</b></font>

04:58.730 --> 05:00.980
<font size="20"><b>I thought that might be the case.</b></font>

05:02.610 --> 05:04.240
<font size="20"><b>What?! What are you...?</b></font>

05:04.240 --> 05:06.740
<font size="20"><b>You never existed.</b></font>

05:06.740 --> 05:09.240
<font size="20"><b>You never worked at the estate either.</b></font>

05:09.490 --> 05:11.850
<font size="20"><b>Nobody knows who you are.</b></font>

05:11.850 --> 05:16.420
<font size="20"><b>That's not... Master!
Please tell them that's not true!</b></font>

05:17.250 --> 05:19.100
<font size="20"><b>Mother...</b></font>

05:20.920 --> 05:22.630
<font size="20"><b>If only...</b></font>

05:22.630 --> 05:24.880
<font size="20"><b>If only I never had you!</b></font>

05:32.890 --> 05:36.190
<font size="20"><b>Those were my mother's last words.</b></font>

05:41.190 --> 05:42.350
<font size="20"><b>Wait.</b></font>

05:43.170 --> 05:47.810
<font size="20"><b>Moments before I was to be killed,
my father proposed an idea.</b></font>

05:48.360 --> 05:52.330
<font size="20"><b>That if I were to be sent far
away and live out a quiet life,</b></font>

05:52.330 --> 05:54.250
<font size="20"><b>perhaps they could spare me.</b></font>

05:54.830 --> 05:58.330
<font size="20"><b>Your name will be Christa Lenz.</b></font>

06:07.550 --> 06:09.690
<font size="20"><b>Please forgive me for everything.</b></font>

06:10.140 --> 06:13.920
<font size="20"><b>In order to protect you,
I had no other choice.</b></font>

06:14.430 --> 06:16.520
<font size="20"><b>F-Father...</b></font>

06:17.140 --> 06:19.830
<font size="20"><b>I was always thinking about you.</b></font>

06:20.480 --> 06:23.940
<font size="20"><b>I've always dreamed of the day
I could hold you like this.</b></font>

06:24.860 --> 06:28.780
<font size="20"><b>You're special... Royal
blood runs through you.</b></font>

06:31.280 --> 06:33.030
<font size="20"><b>It... does?</b></font>

06:33.450 --> 06:35.580
<font size="20"><b>That's right, Historia.</b></font>

06:36.450 --> 06:40.370
<font size="20"><b>Our Reiss family is the true royal line.</b></font>

06:40.370 --> 06:45.580
<font size="20"><b>And because you're special, you're the one
and only person who can save all of humanity.</b></font>

06:46.010 --> 06:48.090
<font size="20"><b>Now, let us go, Historia.</b></font>

06:48.470 --> 06:50.880
<font size="20"><b>To the place it all began...</b></font>

06:55.180 --> 06:56.390
<font size="20"><b>Sannes!</b></font>

06:56.730 --> 06:58.930
<font size="20"><b>Are you... all right?!</b></font>

07:00.770 --> 07:02.980
<font size="20"><b>Hey, don't tell me...</b></font>

07:03.230 --> 07:05.610
<font size="20"><b>You didn't tell them anything, right?</b></font>

07:06.200 --> 07:08.530
<font size="20"><b>Our loyalty to the King is more--</b></font>

07:09.780 --> 07:10.900
<font size="20"><b>Sannes!</b></font>

07:10.900 --> 07:13.700
<font size="20"><b>I can't stand to hear your voice anymore!</b></font>

07:13.700 --> 07:17.160
<font size="20"><b>You've betrayed me since the very beginning!</b></font>

07:19.120 --> 07:21.460
<font size="20"><b>To think how I trusted you!</b></font>

07:21.650 --> 07:24.500
<font size="20"><b>Sannes! He never told us anything.</b></font>

07:24.500 --> 07:26.710
<font size="20"><b>In fact, we never questioned him.</b></font>

07:28.840 --> 07:33.890
<font size="20"><b>We threatened Ralph with a knife and
forced him to read this script that I wrote.</b></font>

07:33.890 --> 07:34.930
<font size="20"><b>That's all.</b></font>

07:41.140 --> 07:41.940
<font size="20"><b>Then...</b></font>

07:42.940 --> 07:44.000
<font size="20"><b>I...</b></font>

07:44.650 --> 07:46.940
<font size="20"><b>I betrayed the King?</b></font>

07:51.450 --> 07:53.660
<font size="20"><b>Y-You devils!</b></font>

07:56.490 --> 08:02.960
<font size="20"><b>I'm not trying to deny it, but... I'm sure
Nick thought the same thing about you.</b></font>

08:03.500 --> 08:06.040
<font size="20"><b>That's why I said what I did.</b></font>

08:06.040 --> 08:09.130
<font size="20"><b>That I was beginning to feel sorry for you.</b></font>

08:09.130 --> 08:13.760
<font size="20"><b>Look at how pathetic you are!
Grown-ass men wailing and crying!</b></font>

08:13.770 --> 08:16.760
<font size="20"><b>It serves you right, morons!</b></font>

08:16.760 --> 08:21.350
<font size="20"><b>See how you like spending the rest
of your life shitting in a tiny cell!</b></font>

08:21.350 --> 08:22.940
<font size="20"><b>See you.</b></font>

08:23.980 --> 08:25.940
<font size="20"><b>Next in line...</b></font>

08:27.650 --> 08:31.970
<font size="20"><b>This role of ours... There's an order to it.</b></font>

08:32.500 --> 08:37.280
<font size="20"><b>When one's role is done,
another steps in to start the act again.</b></font>

08:38.880 --> 08:42.140
<font size="20"><b>And thus, the world can never be rid of it.</b></font>

08:44.420 --> 08:46.790
<font size="20"><b>Good luck, Hange.</b></font>

08:50.000 --> 08:51.510
<font size="20"><b>Section Commander?</b></font>

09:06.480 --> 09:09.630
<font size="20"><b>Sorry... I made a mess.</b></font>

09:10.270 --> 09:11.650
<font size="20"><b>There was a cockroach.</b></font>

09:12.200 --> 09:17.160
<font size="20"><b>I see... Just one kick of yours
should've blasted it to bits.</b></font>

09:17.910 --> 09:20.120
<font size="20"><b>It's about time you fill them in.</b></font>

09:20.120 --> 09:22.850
<font size="20"><b>Oh... Yeah, I should.</b></font>

09:23.450 --> 09:25.160
<font size="20"><b>Eren will be eaten?!</b></font>

09:25.500 --> 09:26.170
<font size="20"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

09:26.750 --> 09:29.920
<font size="20"><b>Eren remembered a conversation
that went like this...</b></font>

09:30.250 --> 09:32.120
<font size="20"><b>Do you resent me for it?</b></font>

09:32.760 --> 09:34.070
<font size="20"><b>I'm not sure...</b></font>

09:34.550 --> 09:36.970
<font size="20"><b>I... don't know.</b></font>

09:37.800 --> 09:40.850
<font size="20"><b>You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...</b></font>

09:41.580 --> 09:46.810
<font size="20"><b>Speculating based on that, Ymir was a
Titan wandering alone outside the wall.</b></font>

09:46.810 --> 09:51.230
<font size="20"><b>Bertholdt, Reiner, and Annie
had a comrade that she ate.</b></font>

09:51.230 --> 09:55.320
<font size="20"><b>When a Titan eats someone,
they don't change back into a human.</b></font>

09:55.320 --> 09:58.660
<font size="20"><b>But, what if a Titan ate
one of Reiner's comrades?</b></font>

09:58.660 --> 10:02.240
<font size="20"><b>They're humans who can transform into Titans.</b></font>

10:02.240 --> 10:07.750
<font size="20"><b>In other words, if a Titan eats someone with
that power, they revert back into a human.</b></font>

10:07.750 --> 10:11.000
<font size="20"><b>Furthermore, they obtain
the power of those they eat.</b></font>

10:11.750 --> 10:17.170
<font size="20"><b>In the other day's battle, Reiner was
throwing Titans at Eren, who had escaped.</b></font>

10:17.670 --> 10:21.510
<font size="20"><b>Eren has the power to
control Titans with his scream.</b></font>

10:21.510 --> 10:24.560
<font size="20"><b>He was trying to snatch
that power with those Titans.</b></font>

10:24.560 --> 10:30.020
<font size="20"><b>In that case, Eren is just a vessel
who is bound to be replaced.</b></font>

10:30.490 --> 10:36.320
<font size="20"><b>Basically, if the government has a Titan
of their own, they'll be the one to eat Eren.</b></font>

10:39.200 --> 10:40.570
<font size="20"><b>Calm down.</b></font>

10:40.570 --> 10:44.950
<font size="20"><b>Even if you go on a rampage,
they're not going to give Eren back to us.</b></font>

10:45.280 --> 10:48.910
<font size="20"><b>Anyways, we head for
the lands of this Rod Reiss.</b></font>

10:48.910 --> 10:50.920
<font size="20"><b>Get ready to leave at once.</b></font>

10:50.920 --> 10:52.040
<font size="20"><b>Yes, sir!</b></font>

10:55.100 --> 10:59.090
<font size="20"><b>I'll go tell Erwin what we learned
about the Reiss family.</b></font>

10:59.090 --> 11:01.180
<font size="20"><b>I'm sure he's waiting to hear from us.</b></font>

11:01.730 --> 11:02.800
<font size="20"><b>Right.</b></font>

11:02.800 --> 11:06.680
<font size="20"><b>We can meet up on Reiss' land.
Hear from me at the usual spot.</b></font>

11:10.770 --> 11:14.610
<font size="20"><b>Excuse me. Commander Erwin,
Pyxis is here for you.</b></font>

11:14.860 --> 11:15.980
<font size="20"><b>The commander?</b></font>

11:15.980 --> 11:18.830
<font size="20"><b>Yes, he wants to see you.</b></font>

11:20.570 --> 11:21.610
<font size="20"><b>Let him in.</b></font>

11:21.610 --> 11:22.660
<font size="20"><b>Sir!</b></font>

11:27.080 --> 11:29.450
<font size="20"><b>Sorry about the late visit.</b></font>

11:30.460 --> 11:33.130
<font size="20"><b>I just couldn't stand still, you see.</b></font>

11:33.630 --> 11:35.690
<font size="20"><b>I finished reading your letter.</b></font>

11:36.090 --> 11:38.610
<font size="20"><b>I came with some thoughts of my own.</b></font>

11:41.010 --> 11:44.850
<font size="20"><b>But, first I need to ask... Are you serious?</b></font>

11:46.350 --> 11:47.100
<font size="20"><b>Yes.</b></font>

11:48.390 --> 11:52.930
<font size="20"><b>In order to retake Wall Maria,
we'll overthrow the government.</b></font>

12:02.660 --> 12:05.160
<font size="20"><b>I knew this would happen one day.</b></font>

12:05.700 --> 12:09.040
<font size="20"><b>This cramped world can only
hold people for so long</b></font>

12:09.040 --> 12:11.330
<font size="20"><b>before they begin to lash out.</b></font>

12:11.330 --> 12:17.170
<font size="20"><b>And when that time came, I'd have to
point my gun at the King as well.</b></font>

12:18.250 --> 12:25.090
<font size="20"><b>If my guess proves correct, this plan will not
require military forces to take action.</b></font>

12:25.090 --> 12:28.180
<font size="20"><b>Nor should it be necessary for anyone to die.</b></font>

12:28.180 --> 12:33.940
<font size="20"><b>Oh? Do tell me then.
Is such a method possible?</b></font>

12:34.730 --> 12:38.830
<font size="20"><b>However, the groundwork for this
to happen is not quite ready.</b></font>

12:39.480 --> 12:45.450
<font size="20"><b>And if everything is not in order, me and
everyone else will be hanged, no doubt.</b></font>

12:45.780 --> 12:48.080
<font size="20"><b>Oh, that's all?</b></font>

12:48.080 --> 12:51.330
<font size="20"><b>In other words, it's another huge gamble.</b></font>

12:51.330 --> 12:53.910
<font size="20"><b>It seems I may be a betting man.</b></font>

12:54.540 --> 12:56.670
<font size="20"><b>The news should come shortly.</b></font>

12:56.670 --> 13:01.210
<font size="20"><b>Until it arrives, I'd like you to hear
a story regarding my childhood.</b></font>

13:01.550 --> 13:02.460

13:03.130 --> 13:06.140

13:57.690 --> 14:00.400
<font size="20"><b>As one possessing the true royal blood.</b></font>

14:02.150 --> 14:06.280
<font size="20"><b>And you'll force the makeshift
King to relinquish the crown?</b></font>

14:06.280 --> 14:08.160
<font size="20"><b>To the true Queen...</b></font>

14:08.410 --> 14:12.370
<font size="20"><b>Without spilling any blood,
we will overthrow the government.</b></font>

14:12.370 --> 14:17.800
<font size="20"><b>And in front of the people, we'll reveal that
the system as they know it has all been a lie.</b></font>

14:20.040 --> 14:22.920
<font size="20"><b>Very well. I'll back your plan.</b></font>

14:24.170 --> 14:29.390
<font size="20"><b>However, whether or not it should be
carried out is not for us to decide.</b></font>

14:29.390 --> 14:31.930
<font size="20"><b>You understand that, don't you, Erwin?</b></font>

14:32.260 --> 14:34.460
<font size="20"><b>Of course, Commander.</b></font>

14:40.020 --> 14:42.440
<font size="20"><b>Did anything come of the Reiss investigation?</b></font>

14:42.820 --> 14:44.690
<font size="20"><b>I found out as much as I could.</b></font>

14:46.190 --> 14:49.450
<font size="20"><b>From all that I learned,
one curious incident stuck out.</b></font>

14:49.450 --> 14:50.610
<font size="20"><b>Incident?</b></font>

14:51.660 --> 14:55.540
<font size="20"><b>Commander Erwin! The Interior Squad
demands you turn yourself in!</b></font>

14:56.540 --> 15:00.960
<font size="20"><b>They're making a scene in the middle of
the city that you organized a murder!</b></font>

15:01.670 --> 15:04.660
<font size="20"><b>It seems the enemy's been
making plans of their own.</b></font>

15:05.000 --> 15:06.920
<font size="20"><b>Hange, get far from here.</b></font>

15:06.920 --> 15:09.630
<font size="20"><b>Huh?! What are you planning to do?</b></font>

15:09.930 --> 15:12.640
<font size="20"><b>I need to be the face of the Scout Regiment.</b></font>

15:13.140 --> 15:15.720
<font size="20"><b>You should act at your own discretion.</b></font>

15:16.180 --> 15:19.390
<font size="20"><b>Furthermore, the next commander
of the Scout Regiment...</b></font>

15:19.850 --> 15:21.650
<font size="20"><b>Hange Zoë, it's you.</b></font>

15:23.270 --> 15:25.140
<font size="20"><b>The Scouts are in your hands.</b></font>

15:30.820 --> 15:31.990
<font size="20"><b>Hey, he's here.</b></font>

15:31.990 --> 15:33.530
<font size="20"><b>It's Erwin.</b></font>

15:38.750 --> 15:41.870
<font size="20"><b>I take it you know who this is, Erwin?</b></font>

15:43.330 --> 15:45.380
<font size="20"><b>The boss of Reeves Company.</b></font>

15:45.880 --> 15:47.630
<font size="20"><b>Mr. Dimo Reeves.</b></font>

15:47.630 --> 15:50.800
<font size="20"><b>Yesterday, and in this very place,</b></font>

15:50.800 --> 15:53.840
<font size="20"><b>Eren Jaeger was abducted
by underlings of Reeves.</b></font>

15:53.840 --> 15:59.270
<font size="20"><b>However... that was all a mere scheme
between the Scouts and Reeves Company</b></font>

15:59.270 --> 16:03.420
<font size="20"><b>in order to evade handing over
Eren Jaeger to the government.</b></font>

16:04.360 --> 16:10.240
<font size="20"><b>And then... when Reeves was no longer needed,
they killed the man to keep him from talking.</b></font>

16:10.240 --> 16:14.130
<font size="20"><b>The murderer is still at large
and must be holed up with Eren.</b></font>

16:14.700 --> 16:16.660
<font size="20"><b>What a convenient story that is.</b></font>

16:17.280 --> 16:19.330
<font size="20"><b>What you scoundrels are doing...</b></font>

16:19.330 --> 16:23.080
<font size="20"><b>It's the same as monopolizing
Eren's power for yourself.</b></font>

16:23.080 --> 16:27.210
<font size="20"><b>And that act violates clause six
of the Humanity Charter.</b></font>

16:27.210 --> 16:29.420
<font size="20"><b>You know which that one is, don't you?</b></font>

16:29.760 --> 16:34.480
<font size="20"><b>To prioritize one's own gain over the safety
and longevity of humanity, yes?</b></font>

16:35.430 --> 16:36.890
<font size="20"><b>That's right.</b></font>

16:36.890 --> 16:42.430
<font size="20"><b>Therefore, in acknowledgment of violating
said law, all Scouts are to be apprehended!</b></font>

16:42.980 --> 16:44.150
<font size="20"><b>Old man...</b></font>

16:51.440 --> 16:54.360
<font size="20"><b>You think the fat cats
will finally be satisfied?</b></font>

16:54.820 --> 16:58.740
<font size="20"><b>I bet Reeves would be glad to know
he proved useful in the end.</b></font>

16:58.740 --> 17:00.830
<font size="20"><b>There's still Levi to deal with...</b></font>

17:00.830 --> 17:03.790
<font size="20"><b>I told you, he'll show up on his own.</b></font>

17:03.790 --> 17:05.619
<font size="20"><b>We'll crush him when the time comes.</b></font>

17:12.130 --> 17:13.869
<font size="20"><b>What do we do now?!</b></font>

17:16.510 --> 17:17.800
<font size="20"><b>May I have a moment?</b></font>

17:17.800 --> 17:18.890
<font size="20"><b>Hmm?</b></font>

17:23.650 --> 17:26.310
<font size="20"><b>Get away from my husband, you lowlife!</b></font>

17:28.180 --> 17:30.320
<font size="20"><b>In the battle of Trost District,</b></font>

17:30.320 --> 17:34.860
<font size="20"><b>Mr. Reeves delayed the evacuation
by trying to take along his wealth.</b></font>

17:36.410 --> 17:39.330
<font size="20"><b>So what?! Are you saying he deserved to die?!</b></font>

17:39.830 --> 17:44.830
<font size="20"><b>However... given the current situation
with Trost on the verge of collapse...</b></font>

17:45.090 --> 17:48.630
<font size="20"><b>He planted his feet in the city,
and using any means possible...</b></font>

17:48.830 --> 17:52.620
<font size="20"><b>...he aided those with no place to go
while striving to revive the city.</b></font>

17:53.960 --> 17:58.760
<font size="20"><b>Except, by somebody's hands
that dream was extinguished.</b></font>

17:58.760 --> 18:02.260
<font size="20"><b>I promise you... I will avenge him.</b></font>

18:12.400 --> 18:15.240
<font size="20"><b>My father... He was a teacher.</b></font>

18:16.490 --> 18:18.610
<font size="20"><b>One day, we were learning history.</b></font>

18:19.490 --> 18:22.120
<font size="20"><b>To protect themselves from the Titans,</b></font>

18:22.420 --> 18:26.430
<font size="20"><b>humanity took refuge within the walls
and realized 100 years of peace.</b></font>

18:27.250 --> 18:33.160
<font size="20"><b>In doing so, any records of our
earlier past were lost for all of time.</b></font>

18:33.840 --> 18:35.760
<font size="20"><b>That's what we're all taught.</b></font>

18:36.970 --> 18:42.640
<font size="20"><b>However, I... having doubts of my own,
asked my father a question.</b></font>

18:43.810 --> 18:49.120
<font size="20"><b>My father evaded answering the question
and ended class as normal.</b></font>

18:50.100 --> 18:51.020
<font size="20"><b>But...</b></font>

18:52.450 --> 18:56.860
<font size="20"><b>After we got home,
my father answered my question.</b></font>

18:56.860 --> 18:58.990
<font size="20"><b>He said the history books
given by the government</b></font>

18:58.990 --> 19:02.070
<font size="20"><b>were full of contradictions and mysteries.</b></font>

19:02.910 --> 19:08.590
<font size="20"><b>My father continued to tell me more,
and even as I child, I was astounded.</b></font>

19:09.710 --> 19:14.000
<font size="20"><b>There's a reason he didn't tell
that story to the entire class,</b></font>

19:14.000 --> 19:16.590
<font size="20"><b>but I wasn't smart enough to know.</b></font>

19:17.920 --> 19:20.840
<font size="20"><b>I'd been telling the other
kids my father's story,</b></font>

19:21.260 --> 19:24.100
<font size="20"><b>and one day, the Military Police
came to question me.</b></font>

19:25.310 --> 19:30.910
<font size="20"><b>My father didn't come home that day...
He died in some accident in a faraway town.</b></font>

19:31.660 --> 19:36.150
<font size="20"><b>Based on what I knew,
my father was killed by the government.</b></font>

19:37.900 --> 19:42.450
<font size="20"><b>One hundred and seven years ago...
Humanity that fled into these walls...</b></font>

19:42.450 --> 19:46.160
<font size="20"><b>The King had altered their memories
to make them easy to rule.</b></font>

19:47.080 --> 19:49.120
<font size="20"><b>That was my father's theory.</b></font>

19:49.580 --> 19:55.880
<font size="20"><b>Oh? Because if they hadn't done that,
civilization within the walls could never succeed?</b></font>

19:56.260 --> 19:56.990
<font size="20"><b>Yes.</b></font>

19:57.510 --> 20:00.260
<font size="20"><b>Ever since I was a child,
I've been thinking...</b></font>

20:00.260 --> 20:05.140
<font size="20"><b>Why did my father have to die for
nothing more than getting close to the truth?</b></font>

20:05.430 --> 20:09.890
<font size="20"><b>Even those in the government would
believe what they're doing is just.</b></font>

20:10.810 --> 20:14.680
<font size="20"><b>However, I realized one thing about them...</b></font>

20:15.380 --> 20:21.130
<font size="20"><b>What they're trying to protect is not humanity,
but their gardens, houses, and lands.</b></font>

20:21.820 --> 20:25.990
<font size="20"><b>Rather, if anyone dares
threaten their authority,</b></font>

20:25.990 --> 20:28.660
<font size="20"><b>they'll be extinguished, whoever they are.</b></font>

20:29.080 --> 20:32.920
<font size="20"><b>In the end, there was nothing
to justify my father's death.</b></font>

20:34.060 --> 20:39.090
<font size="20"><b>My father was killed by human greed...
And by the foolishness of his own son.</b></font>

20:39.860 --> 20:44.590
<font size="20"><b>Before I knew it, my father's theory
became truth inside my heart.</b></font>

20:45.400 --> 20:50.800
<font size="20"><b>Now, my mission in life... It's to prove
my father's theory once and for all.</b></font>

20:54.980 --> 20:57.900
<font size="20"><b>The Scout Regiment murdered a civilian!</b></font>

20:58.470 --> 21:02.150
<font size="20"><b>Some of them have fled capture!
They're still on the loose!</b></font>

21:02.150 --> 21:05.910
<font size="20"><b>If you spot any of these persons,
report it immediately!</b></font>

21:06.190 --> 21:07.830
<font size="20"><b>Told you, didn't I?</b></font>

21:07.830 --> 21:12.250
<font size="20"><b>They're the ones who had that Titan battle here
and destroyed practically everything!</b></font>

21:12.690 --> 21:16.330
<font size="20"><b>I bet they're planning to use that
Eren monster to wipe us out!</b></font>

21:19.460 --> 21:21.960
<font size="20"><b>Captain, we bought the supplies.</b></font>

21:22.380 --> 21:24.510

21:26.550 --> 21:30.470
<font size="20"><b>If this is true, the
Scouts will be disbanded.</b></font>

21:30.850 --> 21:33.350
<font size="20"><b>I heard they'll be hunting for us tonight.</b></font>

21:33.350 --> 21:36.270
<font size="20"><b>They're also putting guards
on all the vital roads,</b></font>

21:41.320 --> 21:43.320
