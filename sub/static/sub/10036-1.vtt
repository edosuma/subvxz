02:11.590 --> 02:12.424
Hey, Mickey.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.347
- Don't tell Mom.
- Don't tell me what?

02:19.598 --> 02:22.225
Nothing. I forgot to go
to the store. No milk.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.853
Fresh one down in the fridge.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.314
What's that you got
behind your back?

02:27.522 --> 02:28.774
Mom, you should've
seen his face.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.484
You're a pushover, young man.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.263
- Good morning, sir.
- Hey, Ben.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.640
- Sit down.
- Sure.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.436
- How do you feel?
- Good.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.397
- Did you swim this morning?
- Yeah.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.275
What are your holding
for your hundreds?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.277
Fifty plus on the minute-thirty.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.362
Not bad.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.322
I can get it under 45, I think.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.118
Can you do it in time
for the Fillmore meet?

04:03.326 --> 04:03.952
Why?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.664
Stanford scouts are flying down.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.210
For the next 8 days,
I want you living in that pool.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.338
And when you're not swimming,
I want you thinking about it.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.048
I want you dreaming about it.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.593
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.180
I don't mean to put any
undue pressure on you.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.850
What are we talking about here,
your entire future?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.394
Right. Right.

04:30.020 --> 04:30.937
Go and change.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.397
Alright. Thank you.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.863
California boy, can I
have your autograph?

04:40.071 --> 04:40.697
Nasty.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.574
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.494
- Nervous?
- Yeah, a little bit.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.579
- You're gonna kick ass.
- I hope so.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.207
That is, until I outswim
your little punk ass.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.293
And those scouts forget your name
and grant me the scholarship.

04:53.502 --> 04:54.795
I just remembered why
we broke up, Josh.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.046
You couldn't handle me in bed.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.215
No, because you're an asshole.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.426
Ben just got good news.
The response is congratulations.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.761
You're right.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.680
Congratulations, dickhead.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.434
- Let's not be mature today.
- I'm all for that.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.646
Let's make it Opposite Day
and everybody be immature.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.032
Hey, watch it!

05:28.620 --> 05:29.913
Forget about it.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.248
Hey, Dante.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.837
He's crazy. He's a freak.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.674
- Hey, congrats.
- Thanks.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.430
- So...
- So?

05:49.224 --> 05:51.017
It might actually happen?

05:51.476 --> 05:54.938
Can you picture it?
Me in California?

05:55.814 --> 05:58.692
- And me in Rhode Island.
- Yeah.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.949
- That's 3,000 miles.
- I know how many miles it is.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.035
- I love you.
- I love you too.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.415
Nothing is going to change that.

06:16.752 --> 06:20.714
- I bought you something.
- What?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.760
Open it first.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.433
- That is so beautiful.
- You're beautiful.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.186
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

06:35.437 --> 06:39.024
I would even be here if it
wasn't for you believing in me.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.987
This is a ploy to get laid.

06:45.030 --> 06:45.864
Is it working?

07:14.476 --> 07:15.519
Excuse me?

07:17.979 --> 07:21.274
I can't get this thing open
and I'm late for English.

07:22.025 --> 07:22.901
Do you think you could...?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.987
I can take a look, yeah.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.950
They gave me the combination, but...

07:30.325 --> 07:31.993
I don't need it. I just need...

07:34.746 --> 07:36.498
...that, right there.
- This?

07:39.000 --> 07:39.626
Thank you.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.380
Can't let you be late
on your first day.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.132
Is it that obvious?

08:00.105 --> 08:01.773
Thank you so much.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.901
- Here.
- Keep it.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.280
You never know when
I might need saving again.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.867
I'm Madison Bell.

08:12.075 --> 08:12.951
Ben Cronin. Hi.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.495
What the letter for, Ben Cronin?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.831
The letter is for swimming,
Madison Bell.

08:18.874 --> 08:22.085
- Are you good?
- I'm okay, yeah.

08:27.174 --> 08:27.799
See you around.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.426
- See you.
- Bye.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.645
- There's my swim champ.
- Mom...

08:43.774 --> 08:46.568
Better get started with Mr. Tillman.
He's been asking for you.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.411
Ben! Give me some good news.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.996
Scouts are coming next week.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.122
Girl Scouts?

08:59.456 --> 09:02.501
No, swim scouts, from Stanford,
to see me.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.127
I asked you to find me a woman.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.963
It's hard to find anyone in
your age bracket still breathing.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.173
Here you go.

09:10.842 --> 09:11.885
I almost forgot...

09:14.554 --> 09:16.807
That's my boy!

09:20.936 --> 09:22.521
Anything else?

09:25.190 --> 09:26.608
You guys okay?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.953
- Did you miss me?
- Like crazy.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.498
Wait. I've been thinking.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.835
What if I didn't go to
Rhode Island next year?

09:45.293 --> 09:45.919
What do you mean?

09:46.211 --> 09:49.047
What if I went to Berkeley instead?

09:50.006 --> 09:52.634
We'd be closer when you
go to Stanford and...

09:53.427 --> 09:55.804
- We could get an apartment.
- Amy.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.141
- I haven't gotten in yet.
- But you will.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.271
If you hate the idea, it's okay.

10:04.729 --> 10:08.024
No, are you kidding?
It's a great idea.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.278
- Really?
- Really. It's a great idea.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.001
Morning, Benjamin.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.047
- A little early for you, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.010
I thought I'd get a little
lane time in before the rush.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.513
Got to look good for the scouts.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.182
Yeah, right.

10:40.599 --> 10:44.728
I know they'll be looking at you,

10:46.188 --> 10:47.981
but the rest of us
will be in the pool.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.026
The more the merrier, buddy.

10:52.527 --> 10:56.406
So... Madison Bell.

10:58.241 --> 10:58.867
What?

11:00.243 --> 11:03.538
She's a senior, originally
from down South.

11:03.747 --> 11:07.459
I plan to hear that Southern accent
when she moans my name.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.211
Or when she applies
the restraining order.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.297
- Do you want to hear or not?
- Sure. What's up?

11:12.631 --> 11:16.676
The reason she's up here
is her family's in Europe.

11:17.469 --> 11:21.139
She's staying here with her cousin.
Guess who her cousin is.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.975
- Who is her cousin?
- Christopher Dante.

11:26.645 --> 11:30.607
You're set. He loves you.
He's gonna put in a good word.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.319
- Do you think he would, seriously?
- He really would.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.780
- Think about it.
- No! No!

11:55.340 --> 11:56.299
Shit!

11:59.261 --> 12:00.262
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

12:00.470 --> 12:01.763
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

12:02.097 --> 12:03.557
- No, don't worry about it.
- I didn't see you.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.934
- Really, it's all right.
- Here, here.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.437
Thanks. It's okay.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.064
- Let me give you a ride.
- No, I'm fine.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.150
It's the least I can do.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.111
- I'm fine.
- Please? I insist.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.200
- Well, if you insist.
- I do. Come on.

12:24.786 --> 12:29.416
I wasn't looking at the road.
I thought I saw somebody I knew.

12:43.180 --> 12:43.805
That way?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.363
How's that for service?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.241
You're a handy guy to have around.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.494
Yeah, handy all over the place.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.082
See you at school.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.086
See you at school.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.882
Handy all over the place.
What is that?

14:43.175 --> 14:44.468
It's a boy.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.140
Hello?

14:50.682 --> 14:53.477
Hi, Madison. This is Ben Cronin.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.147
You left your notebook in my car.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.026
Pretty sharp. Got a date?

15:02.194 --> 15:05.781
It's just pants and a shirt.
I'll be back in half an hour.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.094
How's it going?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.388
You don't have to be nice to me.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.140
She's already going out with you.

15:32.349 --> 15:35.060
No, we're not going out.
I'm just returning her notebook.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.688
I'll take it.
No reason to hold you up.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.649
I'm sure you've got
more important things to do.

15:42.067 --> 15:42.901
Christopher?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.072
Why didn't you tell me
I had a visitor?

16:11.763 --> 16:14.391
I had to get out of there.
It's so stifling.

16:15.434 --> 16:16.476
You okay?

16:16.685 --> 16:21.106
Yeah. I haven't really
eaten all day.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.654
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.

16:27.863 --> 16:28.488
You're welcome.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.115
So, I've been dying to know...

16:30.323 --> 16:33.535
How come a nice boy like you knows
how to break into girls' lockers?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.746
I didn't used to be so nice.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.539
That's hard to believe.

16:37.748 --> 16:41.042
It was a long time ago.
Everybody's forgotten about it,

16:41.251 --> 16:42.836
except the cops.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.379
You don't have to tell me.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.674
No, I had a situation
with drugs which

16:48.425 --> 16:50.051
turned into a situation
with stealing.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.346
I spent 6 months in juvenile hall.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.265
It was the best thing
that's ever happened to me

16:55.557 --> 16:56.475
'cause they had a pool.

16:57.267 --> 17:01.229
This shitty lab pool that
hadn't been used in years

17:01.438 --> 17:03.523
and I got assigned to clean it.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.943
Soon I was swimming in it
more than I was cleaning it.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.695
It was easier for me to
jump in the pool and forget about

17:10.113 --> 17:14.576
all the mess going on around me
and just swim.

17:15.117 --> 17:19.455
When I play music sometimes,
I just play cello,

17:19.790 --> 17:23.877
and I float out of my body,
above the music where no one

17:25.087 --> 17:26.213
can touch me,

17:26.797 --> 17:28.757
hurt me...

17:28.965 --> 17:30.258
I can escape.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.386
Do you want to escape?

17:33.970 --> 17:37.265
Yeah, sometimes.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.602
But not right now.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.146
Right now, I like where I am.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.739
I should tell you something.

17:52.989 --> 17:56.952
- You have a girlfriend.
- Yeah. Amy.

17:57.411 --> 18:01.373
- Is it serious?
- Yeah, it is.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.878
She's the other reason
I turned my life around.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.006
Story of my life.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.344
Can't expect the nicest,
most handsome guy to be single too.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.599
Don't worry about me.
I got someone waiting in New York.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.812
A great guy.
A really good shortstop too.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.439
The Mets are pretty interested.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.107
The Mets? Really?

18:27.315 --> 18:28.150
- Yeah.
- Wow!

18:28.942 --> 18:31.111
But until we can live
in the same place,

18:31.570 --> 18:33.321
we agreed to see other people

18:33.864 --> 18:35.449
and that's what I intend to do.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.535
My friend Josh

18:39.077 --> 18:42.539
would murder me and step over
my dead body to be here with you.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.501
Thanks, I'm not interested in Josh.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.721
I should take you home.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.099
- Yeah, you should.
- Yeah.

19:03.477 --> 19:05.020
But...

19:07.647 --> 19:09.232
I'm not ready to say goodnight.

19:12.527 --> 19:13.487
What do you want to do?

20:03.954 --> 20:06.248
Careful. I can't swim.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.250
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.001
Show me how?

20:12.587 --> 20:13.422
Yeah.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.760
Come here.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.598
You got to know how to float

20:24.474 --> 20:27.561
and kick, so lean back.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.896
Yeah... very important.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.065
You're a natural.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.485
- Like that?
- Yeah.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.535
The side's right here.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.042
That's easy.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.772
It's okay. I want you to.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.912
Wait, wait.
We can't do this.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.413
We can't do this.

21:28.622 --> 21:31.541
It's all right.
It'll be our little secret.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.297
Maybe not so little.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.206
Ben!

22:12.582 --> 22:13.875
Tell me you love me.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.254
What?

22:17.462 --> 22:21.091
You don't have to mean it.
Just say it for me.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.639
I love you.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.035
So...

22:53.707 --> 22:54.541
So...

22:58.587 --> 23:00.964
- Don't think I do this all the time.
- No!

23:01.840 --> 23:04.676
Of course not, no.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.264
I don't want to be
a locker room joke, so...

23:11.516 --> 23:12.809
don't tell anybody, okay?

23:16.396 --> 23:17.898
I won't tell anybody.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.944
Good. Still friends?

23:34.581 --> 23:35.665
See you tomorrow.

24:15.372 --> 24:17.457
You are so busted.

24:19.876 --> 24:22.712
I thought you'd keep me company
in the restaurant last night.

24:23.130 --> 24:26.925
I'm sorry. I had some homework
at Randy's.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.802
How's his mom doing?

24:31.054 --> 24:33.014
She broke her wrist.
Is it still in a cast?

24:34.474 --> 24:37.227
She seemed okay.
I'm trying to...

24:37.894 --> 24:40.772
Didn't seem like she was in pain.

24:40.981 --> 24:42.524
That's good.

24:42.983 --> 24:45.610
- I left you something.
- What?

24:46.153 --> 24:47.654
It's in your locker.

24:48.405 --> 24:49.990
I hope you like it.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.534
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you too.

25:17.851 --> 25:21.480
Ben, I'm so proud of you.
I love having you in my life.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.191
- Where will your parents be?
- Jamaica.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.778
- Will they be gone all weekend?
- No, all week.

25:28.862 --> 25:29.988
Nice.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.407
I didn't hear Amy invite you.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.576
I'm sorry, I didn't hear anyone
talking to you.

25:36.036 --> 25:37.996
Good time on the over-sleep.

25:38.205 --> 25:39.915
Coach is seriously pissed.

25:43.043 --> 25:44.169
Are these for me?

25:47.297 --> 25:50.175
They're a thank you for the card.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.426
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.452
Way to swim, Josh!

26:18.245 --> 26:21.373
Everybody else, keep your focus.

26:21.957 --> 26:24.584
Focus is key.

26:27.045 --> 26:29.172
Are you okay? What's up?

26:38.598 --> 26:43.103
I don't know if it's
this low-carb diet I'm on,

26:43.645 --> 26:46.273
but Ben and I are like this now
in the water.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.317
Josh, he had a bad swim.
Why don't you give it a rest?

26:49.651 --> 26:50.652
What's up, ladies?

26:51.403 --> 26:54.156
What's going on? Everything cool?

26:54.781 --> 26:57.075
- My swimming buddy.
- That's right.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.453
- May the best man win.
- Absolutely.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.329
There you go. I'm sorry.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.622
Let me give you mine, buddy.

27:12.007 --> 27:13.842
Ben, over here!

27:14.634 --> 27:15.927
Oh my gosh!

27:18.180 --> 27:21.016
I missed you. Where have you been?

27:21.224 --> 27:22.851
- Around.
- Yeah?

27:23.977 --> 27:26.021
Yeah. That's so great. Come here.

27:26.229 --> 27:29.524
There's someone I want you to meet.
Madison?

27:31.026 --> 27:32.778
This is my boyfriend, Ben Cronin.

27:34.112 --> 27:36.406
Nice to meet you. Madison Bell.

27:37.157 --> 27:38.033
Nice to meet you.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.952
I already know all about him.

27:41.369 --> 27:44.206
Amy can't stop talking about
her perfect boyfriend.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.124
Even when I beg her to stop.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.839
Excuse me. I gotta use the bathroom.

27:53.173 --> 27:53.882
You want to hold this?

27:54.091 --> 27:56.718
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

27:59.846 --> 28:03.809
Cronin, I'm making a video run
and you're truck's blocking me in.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.686
I'll do it. Just one second.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.021
I'll be right back.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.523
I gotta get more ice first.

28:10.107 --> 28:11.233
Keys?

28:11.441 --> 28:13.276
Yes.

28:22.786 --> 28:24.454
Don't we have English together?

28:52.190 --> 28:53.942
She's really nice.

28:55.694 --> 29:00.323
She's so sweet and uncomplicated.

29:00.866 --> 29:04.369
Madison, this is a little
awkward for me.

29:04.619 --> 29:05.912
We could go somewhere else.

29:07.205 --> 29:09.624
- Not what I meant.
- I know. I'm kidding.

29:11.126 --> 29:13.587
Is it hot in here or is it me?

29:16.757 --> 29:20.385
I know you're tied up tonight,
but when do I see you again?

29:21.970 --> 29:24.598
- I don't know.
- How about tomorrow?

29:24.806 --> 29:27.976
Tomorrow's not good for me.

29:29.686 --> 29:32.105
I should get back to the party.

29:32.314 --> 29:35.525
By the way, do you have my panties?

29:35.734 --> 29:38.695
- Excuse me?
- My panties.

29:40.363 --> 29:42.449
I may have left them in your car.

29:57.547 --> 29:59.758
Let me do it. It's acting funny.

30:02.511 --> 30:03.261
Thank you.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.877
You got to bring your times down.

31:59.711 --> 32:01.671
I'm not seeing Olympic swimming.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.257
And neither will Stanford.

32:06.468 --> 32:07.761
I know. I've got a lot on my mind.

32:09.971 --> 32:10.680
Sorry.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.145
Get your head back in the game.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.523
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

32:21.441 --> 32:22.067
Sorry.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.694
If you think you'll waltz it through...

32:24.945 --> 32:26.238
No, Coach, no!

32:28.323 --> 32:30.575
I'll be ready on Thursday.

32:33.245 --> 32:36.540
And whatever's going on
between you and your girl,

32:37.833 --> 32:38.458
fix it.

32:40.085 --> 32:41.044
Now go.

32:53.807 --> 32:57.102
- I'm home!
- We're in here.

32:58.353 --> 32:59.229
We?

33:03.650 --> 33:05.610
- He's so cute.
- Yes, I know.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.112
Happy birthday!

33:08.321 --> 33:10.574
Those are beautiful. Thank you.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.993
Madison brought me those.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.251
I'll put these in water.

33:24.254 --> 33:25.756
Surprise!

33:26.965 --> 33:31.261
Can you excuse me for a second?

33:44.024 --> 33:45.192
How long has she been here?

33:45.567 --> 33:48.320
About 20 minutes. Who is she?

33:54.659 --> 33:56.828
It's great to finally
meet your mother.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.374
What do you mean "finally"?
You just met me.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.210
It doesn't feel that way.

34:04.211 --> 34:06.296
How did you know
it was her birthday?

34:06.505 --> 34:09.800
You told me.
At the party, remember?

34:11.384 --> 34:16.014
Madison? I think you're

34:16.223 --> 34:19.226
misunderstanding our relationship
in a fundamental way.

34:22.270 --> 34:24.606
- We're friends?
- Right.

34:25.649 --> 34:27.192
Friends. Exactly.

34:29.110 --> 34:33.072
Friends see each other and are happy
when they stop by with flowers.

34:33.697 --> 34:34.991
What's the problem?

34:37.452 --> 34:42.081
You're coming on strong, you know?

34:43.625 --> 34:46.753
You didn't think so when
we were in the pool.

34:51.466 --> 34:55.846
I have a girlfriend.
I told you I had a girlfriend.

34:57.556 --> 35:02.185
What are you saying?
Making love to me was a mistake?

35:04.729 --> 35:08.108
I guess I am. I'm sorry.

35:15.824 --> 35:20.454
You want to forget about it?
Pretend it never happened?

35:26.001 --> 35:27.294
Maybe I was wrong about you.

35:31.173 --> 35:31.923
Madison?

35:38.513 --> 35:40.265
You won't tell anybody, right?

35:48.732 --> 35:50.400
Tell anybody about what?

36:36.029 --> 36:37.697
Ben, it's not good for him.

36:38.615 --> 36:39.783
It's not good for me either.

36:39.991 --> 36:43.036
Yeah, but don't crap on the carpet
every time you're sick.

36:43.245 --> 36:45.205
Got a point. Sorry, buddy.

36:48.834 --> 36:51.002
- You going into work later?
- Yeah.

36:51.211 --> 36:53.380
- I'll see you.
- Okay. Bye.

36:57.592 --> 36:58.427
Ben!

37:04.599 --> 37:05.725
Now what?

37:07.352 --> 37:10.105
How many times have I told you
to club lock this car?

37:14.568 --> 37:17.696
I guess I forgot. I'm sorry.

37:20.949 --> 37:24.703
Shit, Cronin. Get a grip.

37:33.962 --> 37:35.839
<i>Please enter your password. </i>

37:38.133 --> 37:40.677
<i>You have 81 new emails. </i>

37:50.729 --> 37:52.397
<i>Picture received. </i>

38:13.085 --> 38:13.960
Gotcha!

38:20.300 --> 38:22.719
So here's what I think.

38:23.095 --> 38:27.557
When school's over, we should
go to my empty, parentless house...

38:27.766 --> 38:29.559
I have work.

38:33.688 --> 38:34.815
Maybe afterwards.

38:35.982 --> 38:37.400
My shift starts at six.

38:38.944 --> 38:40.028
Tomorrow?

38:41.613 --> 38:42.906
Is it the meet?

38:44.032 --> 38:47.994
I thought a little release
was supposed to help you sleep.

38:50.664 --> 38:53.583
I just got work. I'm sorry.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.714
I'll let you get back to it.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.016
I'll give you a call.

39:57.481 --> 40:01.443
- I'm Randy, a friend of Josh.
- Right.

40:01.985 --> 40:04.321
- He's told me about you.
- Really?

40:04.529 --> 40:06.740
- Yeah, he did.
- Cool.

40:07.741 --> 40:08.909
Well, I'll see you.

40:12.204 --> 40:14.831
So you and Josh? That's cool.

40:28.678 --> 40:30.555
Could we just sit down?

40:34.184 --> 40:37.479
I want you to know that I know.

40:39.481 --> 40:42.901
- You know?
- I know how freaked out you are.

40:44.444 --> 40:47.280
I know why. It's because of
the other night, right?

40:49.616 --> 40:50.450
Yeah.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.746
I was pushing because
it's senior year.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.999
I was afraid of losing you, but...

40:58.208 --> 40:59.835
but we don't have to make plans now.

41:00.085 --> 41:04.047
We can take everything one step
at a time. I'm fine with that.

41:06.174 --> 41:07.467
I am.

41:09.344 --> 41:10.637
That was my whole speech.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.639
I practiced it and everything.

41:16.476 --> 41:17.769
I don't deserve you.

41:20.605 --> 41:23.817
- Thank you.
- It's true.

41:26.987 --> 41:29.197
I've been looking all over for you.

41:30.282 --> 41:31.867
What are you doing in here?

41:32.784 --> 41:34.953
What's going on?

41:35.704 --> 41:38.123
You're not returning my calls.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.543
Are you mad about Josh?

41:41.752 --> 41:42.502
I'm late for work.

41:43.378 --> 41:45.505
He doesn't mean anything to me.

41:46.715 --> 41:48.550
When I'm with him,
I pretend it's you.

41:50.719 --> 41:52.012
Wow!

41:53.722 --> 41:56.057
Did I do something wrong? Talk to me.

41:56.266 --> 41:59.060
I have a lot going on right now.

42:01.354 --> 42:04.232
Maybe too much.

42:04.483 --> 42:09.112
What don't you get?
I'm trying to drop you.

42:14.242 --> 42:15.786
You don't mean that.

42:17.162 --> 42:20.791
I don't know any other way
but to just say it.

42:22.084 --> 42:26.713
I'm not with you.
I'm with Amy. Amy!

42:27.422 --> 42:31.009
I told you this. Remember?

42:34.971 --> 42:36.264
Sure I remember.

42:37.390 --> 42:40.352
But I also remember
you told me you loved me.

42:45.524 --> 42:46.817
You asked me to!

43:34.364 --> 43:35.365
How are you feeling, sir?

43:37.534 --> 43:40.287
Just get me some Viagra
and a nurse under 70.

43:40.495 --> 43:41.329
Take these, please.

43:44.458 --> 43:45.417
What's wrong?

43:46.293 --> 43:48.920
Is it the swimming?
Pressure getting to you?

43:49.838 --> 43:51.798
Take the pills. I'm running late.

44:02.142 --> 44:03.226
Thank you.

44:36.635 --> 44:40.430
I checked and re-checked
the meds before I left.

44:41.723 --> 44:44.476
Somebody must've switched
the cups around on my cart.

44:44.684 --> 44:45.519
Oh, Ben.

44:45.852 --> 44:46.895
Even if I believed you,

44:47.604 --> 44:50.732
it was your responsibility
to keep your cart with you.

44:52.859 --> 44:53.485
You're lucky.

44:54.778 --> 44:58.073
Mr. Tillman will recover
and no one was seriously hurt.

45:02.327 --> 45:06.456
I'm sorry, Ben, but I have
no choice but to let you go.

45:28.186 --> 45:29.479
I know what you're doing!

45:30.439 --> 45:33.233
I'm telling you now
you better cut this shit out!

45:33.817 --> 45:35.360
You should've told me
you like it rough.

45:35.569 --> 45:38.321
This isn't a game, Madison.

45:39.114 --> 45:40.490
You almost killed somebody.

45:42.284 --> 45:45.454
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna stop calling me,

45:45.662 --> 45:48.290
you're gonna stop paging me.
You're gonna stop visiting me!

45:48.498 --> 45:49.124
Okay?

45:49.708 --> 45:54.129
If you see me in the hallway,
pass by like I don't exist.

45:54.963 --> 45:57.466
- You got it?
- Yes.

46:00.051 --> 46:01.344
Good girl.

46:15.901 --> 46:18.153
I didn't know you were coming by.

46:19.988 --> 46:23.408
- What's wrong?
- We need to talk.

46:24.493 --> 46:25.619
Can you take a break?

46:25.911 --> 46:29.206
No, I can't right now.

46:29.414 --> 46:30.332
Okay. I can wait.

46:31.416 --> 46:33.376
I'm not done till one in the morning.

46:33.585 --> 46:36.004
- You have to rest for the meet.
- Screw the meet.

46:37.214 --> 46:38.507
What's wrong?

46:38.840 --> 46:40.133
We can't talk about it here.

46:41.927 --> 46:46.556
I can skip first period
and we'll go for a drive.

46:47.099 --> 46:49.434
- The morning, okay.
- All right.

46:49.643 --> 46:51.603
- I love you.
- I love you too.

48:44.424 --> 48:47.344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48:50.972 --> 48:52.599
Why?

49:58.290 --> 49:59.124
Excuse me?

50:32.407 --> 50:33.825
Are those the scouts?

50:37.496 --> 50:38.538
Good luck.

50:55.597 --> 50:58.725
- Ben?
- Yeah?

51:06.817 --> 51:09.444
You tested positive for steroids.

51:11.988 --> 51:13.281
- What?
- You heard me.

51:14.366 --> 51:18.328
Steroids are banned
at this school, Ben.

51:19.246 --> 51:23.625
Leave the pool area. Clean out
your locker. You're off the team.

51:23.834 --> 51:25.919
You can't do this to me!

51:27.421 --> 51:30.215
It's a mistake. I don't take steroids!

51:30.549 --> 51:31.258
I don't take...

51:33.385 --> 51:34.970
You did this to yourself.

51:36.138 --> 51:39.057
Now go pack and go home.

51:52.571 --> 51:55.574
Where is she? Where is she?

51:55.782 --> 51:57.242
Dude, you're losing it.

51:59.870 --> 52:00.746
You helped her.

52:03.582 --> 52:05.959
Screw you, Ben.

52:11.882 --> 52:15.594
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Ben Cronin has been disqualified. </i>

52:17.012 --> 52:19.639
<i>Ben Cronin will not compete
in this race. </i>

52:19.848 --> 52:20.682
Come on.

52:30.484 --> 52:33.445
<i>The winner is Josh Jefferson
in lane two! </i>

52:33.653 --> 52:37.032
<i>Time is 1:33:60</i>

52:44.456 --> 52:45.582
Are you taking drugs again?

52:47.793 --> 52:49.377
Would you believe me
if I said no?

52:50.045 --> 52:52.172
This is how it started the last time.

52:53.256 --> 52:55.884
The lying, the screwing up
in school.

52:56.093 --> 52:57.677
Once guilty, always guilty, right?

53:00.347 --> 53:03.266
What I need is for everybody
to just leave me alone

53:03.809 --> 53:05.769
while I figure out how to
get my life back.

53:20.700 --> 53:21.326
Amy?

53:31.628 --> 53:36.007
- Are you okay?
- No.

53:39.344 --> 53:43.598
- And you?
- No.

53:48.270 --> 53:50.647
- I can't believe that...
- She did it.

53:58.447 --> 54:00.240
I really think you should go.

54:23.305 --> 54:24.598
Ben.

54:27.476 --> 54:28.310
Ben?

54:35.650 --> 54:39.154
- What's the matter?
- My name is not Ben.

54:41.323 --> 54:45.368
I know that. Josh, come here.

54:48.872 --> 54:50.582
Josh? Josh.

54:52.084 --> 54:53.376
It's all true, isn't it?

54:55.045 --> 54:56.004
What?

54:57.506 --> 54:58.799
Ben was telling the truth.

55:00.634 --> 55:03.345
You want to hurt him because
he doesn't want you anymore.

55:04.096 --> 55:05.472
Don't say that.

55:07.474 --> 55:08.517
I should have known.

55:09.935 --> 55:11.478
Ben would never do steroids.

55:12.312 --> 55:13.188
He doesn't need them.

55:14.439 --> 55:15.941
God.

55:16.608 --> 55:18.568
You know what? Screw you!

55:19.069 --> 55:20.028
How about that?

55:21.780 --> 55:25.867
Josh, get back here!

55:26.451 --> 55:29.454
Josh, come here!

55:29.663 --> 55:30.956
Josh!

55:35.001 --> 55:38.755
<i>It's okay. I want you to. Touch me. </i>

55:39.506 --> 55:42.801
<i>Hold me. Actually, you can't escape. </i>

55:43.009 --> 55:44.302
<i>Tell me you love me. </i>

55:44.636 --> 55:46.138
<i>I have to tell you something. </i>

55:46.346 --> 55:47.764
<i>-Tell me you love me.
-I love you. </i>

56:43.278 --> 56:46.698
Help! Help!

56:52.788 --> 56:55.415
...a loving son, a brother,

56:56.583 --> 56:59.544
a wonderful student, athlete
and friend.

57:00.378 --> 57:04.132
As we remember these words,
if we die with the Lord,

57:04.341 --> 57:06.093
we shall live with the Lord.

57:06.760 --> 57:10.597
If we endure with the Lord,
we shall reign with him.

57:11.681 --> 57:15.102
Let your ears be attentive
to my supplication.

57:15.936 --> 57:18.897
I trust in the Lord;
my soul trusts in his word.

57:19.731 --> 57:22.359
My soul waits for the Lord.

57:22.609 --> 57:25.112
I will consent to His love.

57:26.655 --> 57:30.200
His love is kindness and redemption.

57:39.668 --> 57:40.460
I didn't do it.

57:43.004 --> 57:45.048
You didn't see anyone enter or leave?

57:45.257 --> 57:47.634
- I told you I didn't.
- No, I know.

57:48.510 --> 57:50.220
Take me through it again.

57:53.348 --> 57:57.102
You remember how this works.

57:58.019 --> 57:59.187
Not that long ago.

58:02.441 --> 58:03.734
Your prints are on the bat.

58:04.276 --> 58:06.236
Along with the rest of the team.

58:06.528 --> 58:09.614
I'm a simple man.
I go by the evidence.

58:10.782 --> 58:11.783
So arrest me.

58:13.201 --> 58:14.494
We're not there yet.

58:15.287 --> 58:18.707
But as they say,
don't leave town.

58:21.084 --> 58:22.669
Don't leave town.

58:24.963 --> 58:26.673
I'm never leaving this town.

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:02.162
You shouldn't be in here.

01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:05.832
If she found you, she'd kill you.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.334
No shit.

01:01:09.628 --> 01:01:10.796
You better come with me.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.007
Come on.

01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:25.936
I found this. Here you go.

01:01:26.144 --> 01:01:27.145
- Wait! Wait!
- Go!

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:30.649
Christopher? Christopher?

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.194
Do you have a guest?

01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:41.827
No, that would mean you had friends.

01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:24.578
Who's Jake Donnelly?

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:27.497
I want to show you something.

01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:28.665
- What?
- Let's go.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.460
Come on. It's not too far.

01:02:51.563 --> 01:02:52.606
You coming in?

01:02:54.357 --> 01:02:56.985
You go in. I'm staying here.

01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:00.322
Go.

01:03:13.418 --> 01:03:15.837
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:18.423
I'm looking for Jake Donnelly.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.800
<i>Don't worry. I've got someone
waiting in New York. </i>

01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:39.671
Can I help you?

01:04:41.631 --> 01:04:44.634
I'm sorry. I'm an old friend
of Jake's.

01:04:47.512 --> 01:04:50.348
Why you kids don't wear
seatbelts, I don't know.

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:54.102
His girlfriend did.
Walked away without a scratch.

01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:02.778
I'll let you spend time
alone with him.

01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:04.571
Thank you.

01:05:06.615 --> 01:05:08.575
Madison left the room like this.

01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:12.579
She was convinced he'd come back
to her one day. Poor thing.

01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:16.208
Just throw on his clothes
and go find her.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.543
You take your time, okay?

01:05:28.762 --> 01:05:30.639
Mom, I got your page. What's up?

01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:32.391
Paramedics just brought Amy in.

01:05:33.475 --> 01:05:35.936
Ben, they're saying
you ran her off the road.

01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:37.604
They have a witness.

01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:40.482
Police are looking for you.
I'm calling you a lawyer.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.109
He can meet me at the hospital.

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:44.945
There's Security everywhere.
They have your picture.

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:47.114
<i>-25 cents.
- Shit!</i>

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:50.700
<i>- Mom, just listen...
-Please deposit 25 cents. </i>

01:05:50.909 --> 01:05:53.537
Madison is responsible, okay?

01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.831
<i>-Please deposit 25 cents.
- You got to protect Amy.</i>

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:58.959
<i>-Please hang up.
- Madison is coming!</i>

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.253
Shit!

01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:19.790
<i>Jake Donnelly, will you
report to the nurses'station. </i>

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:24.294
<i>Paging Jake Donnelly. </i>

01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:29.049
<i>Paging Jake Donnelly. </i>

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.511
<i>Jake Donnelly, please report to
the nurses'station. </i>

01:07:54.658 --> 01:07:56.952
<i>Jake Donnelly, please report to
the nurses'station. </i>

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:02.207
<i>Jake Donnelly, come to
the nurses'station, please. </i>

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:07.421
<i>Paging Jake Donnelly. </i>

01:08:07.629 --> 01:08:09.798
<i>Jake Donnelly, please report to
the nurses'station. </i>

01:08:14.136 --> 01:08:16.888
<i>Jake Donnelly
to the nurses'station. </i>

01:09:06.438 --> 01:09:07.147
Jake!

01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:13.779
Is that you?

01:09:44.059 --> 01:09:45.560
You don't have the guts.

01:09:49.231 --> 01:09:51.191
They think I killed Josh.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.984
That I tried to kill Amy!

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:57.823
And I'm going to spend the rest
of my life in prison!

01:09:58.031 --> 01:10:00.659
What's one more?

01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:03.829
Don't be mad.
I did it for us.

01:10:04.037 --> 01:10:04.788
Us?

01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:06.957
You don't have it in you.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.670
You couldn't hurt a fly.

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:16.091
How stupid do you think I am?

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:20.220
I don't know, baby.

01:10:21.847 --> 01:10:23.348
How stupid are you?

01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:47.873
These look like them?

01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:53.754
It's them.

01:10:54.212 --> 01:10:56.173
If everything checks out
with Ben's statement,

01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:59.885
I'll ring your doorbell and
apologize in person. How's that?

01:11:00.302 --> 01:11:01.595
Excuse me.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.381
Shit!

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.717
Hey, watch the papers.

01:12:24.511 --> 01:12:25.804
<i>She's doing fine. </i>

01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:28.348
Did you find everything okay?

01:12:29.307 --> 01:12:30.434
<i>She can spend the night with us. </i>

01:12:30.976 --> 01:12:32.936
<i>Have a safe flight.
See you in the morning. </i>

01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:44.281
My dad used to cheat on my mom.

01:12:45.532 --> 01:12:46.450
It broke her heart.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:54.082
I remember swearing to myself

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:56.793
that I'd never be like him,
and that...

01:12:57.252 --> 01:12:59.045
when I found somebody I loved,

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:02.549
I would love her forever.

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:07.220
Never thought it was going to
happen so soon.

01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:14.186
You're everything I ever wanted.

01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:18.482
You're everything I ever could want.

01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:21.902
I hate what I did and...

01:14:20.544 --> 01:14:21.628
I got it!

01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:25.757
Mom?

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:30.512
- Mom, I got it.
- Yeah.

01:14:30.887 --> 01:14:31.847
False alarm!

01:15:44.836 --> 01:15:46.797
Mom? Mom?

01:15:56.515 --> 01:15:57.140
Amy!

01:16:06.691 --> 01:16:07.526
Where are you?

01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.486
See that?
You see that right there?

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:52.988
That's where we made love.

01:16:53.196 --> 01:16:54.030
Madison!

01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:56.366
Ben?

01:16:57.075 --> 01:16:59.369
She doesn't love you like I do, Ben.

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:03.165
No one will ever love you
like I do.

01:17:03.915 --> 01:17:07.627
You can stop all this
if you just admit it!

01:17:09.045 --> 01:17:10.338
That you love me!

01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:12.591
I can't do that.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:24.978
Tell her, Ben!

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:34.780
Tell her you love me.
I know it!

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.116
Good going.
