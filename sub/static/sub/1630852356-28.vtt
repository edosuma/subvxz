08:36.500 --> 08:37.539
Aah! Who are you?

08:37.540 --> 08:40.169
I'm Joe. Of Joe's Arcade.

08:40.170 --> 08:42.289
Eek! Konflikt!

08:42.290 --> 08:44.119
-[Joe] Stay put.
I'm calling the police.
-[whimpering]

08:44.120 --> 08:45.789
Bill! Let's get outta here!

08:45.790 --> 08:47.539
- [panting, whimpering]
- Hey! Stop right there!

08:47.540 --> 08:48.789
Bill! Come on!

08:48.790 --> 08:50.459
- [Joe] Stop!
- [Nancy] Come on!

08:50.460 --> 08:52.209
- [Joe] Stop it!
- [Nancy] Bill!

08:52.210 --> 08:53.459
I'm so confused!

08:53.460 --> 08:56.119
Hey! Someone,
stop those kids!

08:56.120 --> 08:57.249
Ha-ha! We did it!

08:57.250 --> 08:59.289
Aah! Touchdown!

08:59.290 --> 09:00.919
- Free tokens!
- All right, now we're talkin'!

09:00.920 --> 09:02.999
Thank you, officer.
Nice job, Remington.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.669
You know, you'd make
a great police officer one day.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.619
Police officer, huh?
"Officer Keyes."

09:08.620 --> 09:10.379
Sure does have
a nice ring to it.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.669
I wasn't talking to you!

09:11.670 --> 09:15.039
Bup bup bup!
I'm plannin' my whole future.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.210
[harmonica playing]

09:19.210 --> 09:20.289
[police officer]
Bill Green?

09:20.290 --> 09:21.419
Your mother's here
to pick you up.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.250
[jail door opens]

09:28.250 --> 09:31.620
-Ma, I'm so sorry--
-Not. Now.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.380
- [Gramma] Stay here.
- [car door shuts]

09:42.250 --> 09:44.250
[muffled screaming]

09:51.330 --> 09:53.879
I don't know what to do, Bill.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.289
I've been so busy
trying to save the farm

09:56.290 --> 09:58.459
that I didn't even notice
you were turning

09:58.460 --> 10:01.829
to a life of crime.
I can't keep ya safe,

10:01.830 --> 10:04.250
and I'm failing you as a mother.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.079
Ma, you're not a failure.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.379
You've sacrificed
so much for me.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.379
And now I want
to return the favor.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.669
Let's take Mr. Quisling
up on his offer.

10:15.670 --> 10:18.539
Bill, well, don't you wanna
run the farm someday?

10:18.540 --> 10:20.379
I'll get my own farm one day,

10:20.380 --> 10:22.249
but I don't need
to have this one.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.209
What I do need is my mom.

10:24.210 --> 10:26.829
Oh... come here, Billy boy.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.789
At least we'll be selling
our land to a farmer

10:28.790 --> 10:30.379
and not some city developers.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.829
Yeah. And with the money
from the sale,

10:31.830 --> 10:33.249
our lives will be easier.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.619
Ooh, I won't have to do
shady jobs

10:34.620 --> 10:36.039
for strangers anymore!

10:36.040 --> 10:38.169
And if nothin' else,
at least this'll

10:38.170 --> 10:40.209
keep you away
from that Nancy girl.

10:40.210 --> 10:42.749
- She's a bad influence!
- [chuckles nervously]

10:42.750 --> 10:46.379
And that's the story
of why we downsized the farm.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.079
But Mr. Quisling did
sell the land to developers!

10:49.080 --> 10:51.419
Yeah, and now the farmland
is city land.

10:51.420 --> 10:53.579
And you didn't even
keep me and Bill apart.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.829
I know! And that's why
sellin' the land

10:55.830 --> 10:58.079
was the biggest mistake
of my life!

10:58.080 --> 11:00.249
Aw, gee, Ma,
I'm sorry I made ya--

11:00.250 --> 11:01.829
But it was worth it.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.249
[all]
Aww!

11:03.250 --> 11:04.290
OK, that's enough.
