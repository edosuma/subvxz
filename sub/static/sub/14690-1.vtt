00:02.832 --> 00:04.857
We'll meet back in the cave.

00:20.717 --> 00:22.685
Wait. Not yet.

00:51.748 --> 00:53.340
No!

01:58.147 --> 01:59.307
Look!

02:01.084 --> 02:02.847
Go get him!

02:19.936 --> 02:21.961
- Come on.
- No.

02:23.339 --> 02:28.299
Find her. Protect her.
This is my journey.

02:29.846 --> 02:31.871
And it lies upon a different path.

02:45.194 --> 02:47.788
Go on. Go on!

03:39.215 --> 03:42.412
I can't see anything.

08:06.983 --> 08:09.417
Son of a whore isn't here!

08:21.831 --> 08:23.890
This will make him come out.

08:49.058 --> 08:52.255
No. No.

09:04.807 --> 09:08.208
Have you had enough
of your vengeance yet?

10:51.447 --> 10:54.109
Tell me where the next village is.

11:11.967 --> 11:12.991
Take him!

11:28.517 --> 11:32.044
She came back and changed
what I could not.

11:36.992 --> 11:39.859
If you are not strong enough
to kill the bear...

11:40.029 --> 11:42.896
...use the bear's strength to kill it.

11:45.935 --> 11:48.369
Take my path...

11:49.471 --> 11:51.735
...and I will take yours.

12:00.249 --> 12:02.308
Tell me!

12:24.340 --> 12:25.671
Rip him apart!

12:59.708 --> 13:01.972
Now will you tell me
where the villagers are?

13:10.152 --> 13:13.815
Many years ago a ship came here.

13:13.989 --> 13:15.718
On board was a boy...

13:18.894 --> 13:22.386
...the son of a great Viking warrior.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.662
I knew your father.

13:43.719 --> 13:46.711
Where are they?

14:06.542 --> 14:08.134
Wait!

14:09.712 --> 14:11.771
I will take you there.

14:11.947 --> 14:14.780
I will be your pathfinder...

14:15.250 --> 14:17.741
...if you let her live.

14:26.895 --> 14:30.854
I knew you could speak like a human.

14:37.005 --> 14:40.497
Gunnar! An eye for an eye!

15:41.637 --> 15:44.572
I decide who dies.

16:02.057 --> 16:07.222
I remember the home of the Dragon Men,
the endless winter.

16:07.396 --> 16:10.729
They know snow and ice
like no other living men.

16:13.101 --> 16:15.899
But they know nothing of our spring.

16:48.937 --> 16:51.906
Where have they gone?

16:52.441 --> 16:53.931
Wait! Wait!

16:56.211 --> 16:59.203
Over the mountains.

17:02.150 --> 17:04.277
I know where they went.

17:05.587 --> 17:08.021
Then lead on.

17:17.332 --> 17:18.458
Over here!

17:33.549 --> 17:35.210
Let's go.

17:56.738 --> 18:01.072
They'll find the others.
What are you doing?

18:01.243 --> 18:03.973
What your father taught me.

18:45.988 --> 18:49.424
Get up, you clumsy bitch!

18:52.594 --> 18:54.391
We go west.

18:55.998 --> 18:59.126
That leads us away from the coast!

19:02.971 --> 19:05.132
Do you think me a fool, boy?

19:07.509 --> 19:09.204
I'm telling the truth.

19:10.812 --> 19:14.213
Bring the bitch.

19:19.554 --> 19:22.216
Over here!

19:30.799 --> 19:32.733
Move!

19:57.559 --> 19:59.652
We should go around the ice.

20:00.162 --> 20:03.529
- He's trying to slow us down.
- No.

20:03.732 --> 20:07.099
It's safer to go around the lake.

20:07.969 --> 20:10.164
We are not cowards!

22:40.155 --> 22:45.593
So you have become the Pathfinder
for the Dragon People. Good.

22:51.566 --> 22:53.295
I'm dying.

22:55.904 --> 22:58.134
Don't complain to me about it.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.608
Anyway, you can't die yet.

23:05.947 --> 23:07.244
You're not done.

23:08.250 --> 23:13.449
- This is for the next Pathfinder.
- Who?

23:15.223 --> 23:17.123
You already know.

23:46.788 --> 23:49.518
Get him out!

23:53.495 --> 23:57.898
- Let him die!
- It was your idea to cross the ice...

23:58.099 --> 24:00.033
...and we still need him.

24:09.411 --> 24:12.039
Is it cold, you bastard?

24:14.950 --> 24:17.316
We'll go around the lake.

25:03.465 --> 25:05.399
The lost hunting party.

26:04.592 --> 26:06.253
Let's tie ourselves together.

26:07.762 --> 26:10.356
The path is too dangerous.

26:13.368 --> 26:15.996
Then you lead the way.

27:01.416 --> 27:03.441
Tie yourselves together!

27:18.633 --> 27:20.965
She stays tied to me.

27:53.902 --> 27:57.497
He's leading us nowhere!

28:10.418 --> 28:11.544
I want you to hit me.

28:12.387 --> 28:15.220
- What?
- Hit me.

28:18.359 --> 28:20.759
Hit me.

28:28.503 --> 28:30.061
Enough, bitch!

28:34.175 --> 28:37.144
You are the son of a Viking. Show it!

28:38.546 --> 28:40.639
Show it!

31:02.824 --> 31:04.382
Here!

31:21.075 --> 31:23.566
Come to me.

33:06.447 --> 33:08.711
Listen to me!

33:09.650 --> 33:10.912
Leave!

33:11.085 --> 33:15.078
No! No, I'm not going
to leave you! No.

33:15.256 --> 33:19.158
Go! Trust me! Please!

33:51.259 --> 33:53.489
Go!

34:06.841 --> 34:11.801
You chose savages
over your own kind.

34:11.978 --> 34:15.880
Die, crying boy...

34:17.418 --> 34:23.357
...because you could not remember
who you are!

34:30.031 --> 34:34.297
I know who I am!

34:48.382 --> 34:54.116
I know who I am!

36:51.639 --> 36:52.765
Do it!

36:53.774 --> 36:56.572
Give me death by the sword.

36:58.446 --> 37:05.284
I am the last of your kind
in this cursed land.

37:11.659 --> 37:13.490
You're not my kind.

38:47.388 --> 38:49.185
They're gone.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.888
The spirit of the profecy...

41:02.389 --> 41:04.050
...has come full circle.

42:07.287 --> 42:09.312
<i>Like my father before me...</i>

42:09.490 --> 42:12.926
<i>... I became the Pathfinder</i>
<i>to the People of the Dawn.</i>

42:20.167 --> 42:24.001
<i>He watched over the coast,</i>
<i>always over the coast...</i>

42:24.171 --> 42:26.662
<i>... looking for signs</i>
<i>of the Dragon Men...</i>

42:26.840 --> 42:29.866
<i>... to keep the wolves of hate</i>
<i>away from our shores.</i>

42:31.378 --> 42:33.278
<i>He had found his path.</i>

42:33.447 --> 42:37.850
<i>Of two peoples,</i>
<i>he was neither, yet he was both.</i>

42:47.127 --> 42:49.288
<i>He changed my life...</i>

42:49.463 --> 42:52.694
<i>... and the destiny of our people.</i>
