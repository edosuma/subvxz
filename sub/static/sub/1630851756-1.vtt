00:19.480 --> 00:21.800
Save our club! Save our club!
Save our club!

00:21.920 --> 00:24.640
Save our club! Save our club!

01:02.040 --> 01:04.200
Maybe it was fate. It was quite surreal.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.520
Kinda felt like that film,<i>The Dirty Dozen,</i> the waifs and strays.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.960
Players themselves that were
just full of untapped potential.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.600
<i>It was just a group of wrong 'uns</i>
<i>that were brought together</i>

01:13.680 --> 01:15.120
<i>and they had a point to prove.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.800
I just knew that this group
was really, really special.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.560
It felt so good. It felt so good.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.120
<i>And it's something that will stay</i>
<i>with me till the day I die.</i>

01:37.880 --> 01:42.840
<i>Each club has a unique history that makes</i>
<i>it different to any other football club.</i>

01:54.720 --> 01:56.400
<i>We've been fighting for promotion.</i>

01:56.480 --> 02:00.520
<i>Battling away relegation,</i>
<i>the ups and downs are always extreme.</i>

02:00.600 --> 02:02.960
<i>There's something about Palace.</i>
<i>They expect the unexpected.</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:04.360
<i>You never know what's gonna happen.</i>

02:04.440 --> 02:06.600
<i>We've always been</i>
<i>played as the underdogs.</i>

02:06.680 --> 02:08.240
<i>We were always in the shadows.</i>

02:09.400 --> 02:10.760
<i>It's a unique football club</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:14.600
<i>-in a unique part of London.</i>
<i>-It's absolutely unbelievable!</i>

02:14.680 --> 02:16.440
<i>They are back from the brink.</i>

02:17.880 --> 02:19.680
<i>A club that they've loved since children.</i>

02:21.080 --> 02:23.160
<i>We've learned that we can win</i>
<i>this championship.</i>

02:23.240 --> 02:25.680
<i>We're the fabric of where we come from.</i>

02:25.760 --> 02:28.720
<i>For the greatest prize,</i>
<i>a place in the first division.</i>

02:30.000 --> 02:35.160
<i>Pardew! They've beaten Liverpool</i>
<i>in one of the most amazing matches.</i>

02:36.760 --> 02:38.160
<i>Wilfried Zaha!</i>

02:39.840 --> 02:41.640
<i>There's something about</i>
<i>the spirit of this club.</i>

02:41.760 --> 02:44.760
<i>And he's got right the way through!</i>
<i>Would you believe it?</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:47.200
<i>They have survived.</i>

02:47.280 --> 02:48.880
It's very special, this place.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.880
<i>Thirty goals for the season!</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:55.320
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>what Crystal Palace have done.</i>

02:55.440 --> 02:57.520
<i>Back from the brink of oblivion...</i>

02:57.880 --> 03:00.040
No one's dying, get on with it.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.320
When that Holmesdale end
gets bouncing it epitomizes

03:02.400 --> 03:03.520
a bit like what the club's all about.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.800
Blue collar, hardworking football club
that likes upsetting the aristocrats.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.200
<i>I've always seen Palace</i>
<i>as a sleeping giant.</i>

03:10.280 --> 03:12.320
<i>The potential of Palace</i>
<i>is the same as Liverpool.</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:14.000
<i>Very unique, I must admit.</i>

03:15.000 --> 03:18.800
We're just untapped potential,
that's the story of this football club.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.240
I think we're standing
on the edge of greatness.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.600
<i>Crystal Palace have always been part</i>
<i>of the backdrop of my life, really.</i>

04:01.680 --> 04:03.440
<i>I started supporting the team</i>
<i>when I was four.</i>

04:03.520 --> 04:06.880
<i>My father gave me the choice</i>
<i>of Millwall or Crystal Palace.</i>

04:06.960 --> 04:08.600
<i>There weren't many Palace fans around.</i>

04:08.680 --> 04:10.800
<i>It wasn't that easy to find</i>
<i>a group of people</i>

04:10.880 --> 04:13.400
to go with, but I did go.
It was the backdrop to my life.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.960
Everywhere I went around the world,
I would always check the Palace result.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.560
<i>Big games like</i>
<i>the Sunderland play-off semi,</i>

04:19.640 --> 04:22.280
<i>I was in Greece</i>
<i>listening to that on the radio.</i>

04:22.400 --> 04:25.600
<i>I think it's an obsession,</i>
<i>the first thing you fall in love with</i>

04:25.680 --> 04:26.800
is your football team, isn't it?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.480
It's just followed me around ever since,

04:28.600 --> 04:30.200
and I love the club, I love everything

04:30.280 --> 04:32.200
it means to the people
that are involved in it.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.640
<i>1990, we finally arrived</i>
<i>in the top division.</i>

04:36.720 --> 04:38.880
<i>And we had a period of real success.</i>

04:38.960 --> 04:42.400
<i>Got to a cup final,</i>
<i>we were third in the old first division.</i>

04:42.480 --> 04:44.720
<i>We were founding members</i>
<i>of the Premier League.</i>

04:45.920 --> 04:49.360
<i>If you went to Selhurst Park</i>
<i>and you went to Highbury,</i>

04:49.440 --> 04:51.920
<i>in the early 90's, you wouldn't have had</i>
<i>a different experience,</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:53.640
<i>you were in the same stratosphere.</i>

04:53.720 --> 04:56.080
<i>We just never seemed</i>
<i>to grasp that moment.</i>

04:56.160 --> 04:58.080
<i>We would last one season</i>
<i>in the Premiere League,</i>

04:58.160 --> 05:01.800
we'd be relegated sometimes,
with terrible luck, 49 points,

05:01.880 --> 05:03.320
or fourth from bottom.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.200
<i>By 2010, Arsenal were in the Emirates.</i>

05:08.280 --> 05:10.960
<i>And we were at a run-down</i>
<i>version of Selhurst Park.</i>

05:11.080 --> 05:13.160
<i>Find ourselves</i>
<i>at the bottom of the championship,</i>

05:13.280 --> 05:15.800
<i>fighting to stay in that division.</i>

05:15.920 --> 05:18.400
<i>Very, very difficult ownerships.</i>

05:18.520 --> 05:20.120
<i>About to go out of business almost.</i>

05:20.200 --> 05:22.120
<i>And I always looked</i>
<i>from afar and thought,</i>

05:22.200 --> 05:24.040
this club is not where it should be.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.440
And I was determined at some point,
if I got the opportunity,

05:26.520 --> 05:28.680
that I would get it back on its feet.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.440
<i>Ron Noades called me,</i>
<i>said that the club owed money,</i>

05:31.520 --> 05:34.640
and would I be interested
in buying the loan with him.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.920
And that led to some conversations
with people, with the club.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.480
We were on the way to Newcastle
to watch the game.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.680
And by the time we got off the plane,

05:44.360 --> 05:45.640
the club was in administration.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.920
<i>It was weird, 'cause obviously,</i>
<i>you are in the plane,</i>

05:55.000 --> 05:57.600
<i>and switch off your phone and stuff.</i>

05:57.720 --> 05:59.560
<i>Took off, landed there,</i>

06:00.760 --> 06:03.040
<i>people started switching on their phones.</i>

06:03.120 --> 06:07.240
And all of a sudden, it was like,
bling, bling... Messages.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.400
We were looking at each other,
"What's going on?"

06:09.480 --> 06:11.480
Picking out... their phones and then

06:11.600 --> 06:13.160
we didn't understand anything
what was happening.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.920
And then obviously the news
were out that

06:16.000 --> 06:17.640
we were put in administration.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.360
Well, the uncertainty
was huge at the time,

06:20.480 --> 06:21.720
we didn't know what was happening,

06:21.800 --> 06:24.480
if we were going to have a club
to play football.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.840
It was a genuine, genuine feeling

06:51.920 --> 06:53.520
that the club was gonna go bust.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.880
If we'd been relegated that season,
that might've made it

06:55.960 --> 06:57.840
very, very difficult
for anybody to buy us.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.280
There was a point
where I was actually thinking,

07:00.360 --> 07:02.960
"Who would I follow now?
What would I do?"

07:03.040 --> 07:06.760
<i>We went from having 60 people here,</i>
<i>overnight cut to 29.</i>

07:06.840 --> 07:08.880
It was a horrible, horrible feeling.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
You'd think there would have been
some serious buyers coming along

07:12.080 --> 07:13.440
<i>for a famous football club.</i>

07:14.240 --> 07:16.000
<i>But there weren't. Businesses go under</i>

07:16.080 --> 07:17.440
and people said,
"Why is it any different?"

07:17.520 --> 07:21.200
It's different because this business
is in the heart of our community.

07:21.280 --> 07:26.160
I can't find the right words to describe
how bereft so many people would've been.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.400
<i>It's a terrible feeling,</i>
<i>watching people lose their jobs,</i>

07:28.520 --> 07:30.880
...having uncertainty hanging over
the whole club.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.840
We were on the brink of
just not existing at all anymore.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.960
You know, it was quite
a worrying time, really.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.600
We hit rock bottom.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.960
<i>Martin Long had actually, previously,</i>
<i>lent money to the club.</i>

07:44.040 --> 07:47.000
He said, "Look, if you want an investor,
you want somebody to help you,

07:47.080 --> 07:48.840
I'll look at it."
But I said to the administrator,

07:48.880 --> 07:51.840
"Look, I don't have time, you know.
I've got an advertising business.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.880
I can't run a football club.
I don't have time.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.280
If you can't find anybody though,

07:56.360 --> 07:58.640
come and see me, because
I won't let it go under."

07:58.720 --> 08:02.520
I would work out something.
They'd advertised in the FT.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.320
But it was the financial crisis,
and there were just no buyers.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.360
And it got to a crucial point.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.280
<i>It was between us</i>
<i>and Sheffield Wednesday.</i>

08:31.360 --> 08:32.680
<i>Fundamentally, who went down.</i>

08:32.760 --> 08:36.560
<i>Sudden death, one off game.</i>
<i>We had the advantage that a draw</i>

08:36.680 --> 08:38.360
<i>kept us in the division.</i>

08:38.480 --> 08:43.000
<i>At that time, it felt like</i>
<i>that was gonna be the end.</i>

08:43.160 --> 08:47.800
<i>It was nail-biting,</i>
<i>and it was so, so hard to watch.</i>

08:48.320 --> 08:51.000
<i>You know, people say, "Oh yeah,</i>
<i>football's great",</i>

08:51.160 --> 08:53.080
<i>and, "There's nothing better,</i>

08:53.200 --> 08:56.400
than go out there and play football
in front of all these fans and stuff."

08:56.480 --> 08:58.240
But when you get to those moments,

08:59.040 --> 09:01.880
<i>it's not that easy</i>
<i>and there's something big at stake.</i>

09:01.960 --> 09:04.160
<i>It's tough. Those moments</i>
<i>are not that enjoyable.</i>

09:04.280 --> 09:05.880
<i>Everything was at stake.</i>

09:07.920 --> 09:12.320
<i>Ambrose with the corner. Floated in!</i>
<i>Alan Lee scores for Crystal Palace.</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:17.360
It's game on and it's Leon Clarke.
Oh, what a finish!

09:22.800 --> 09:24.400
<i>What a finish!</i>

09:24.440 --> 09:27.280
<i>-It's Scannell.</i>
<i>-Ambrose! Goal!</i>

09:31.880 --> 09:34.680
<i>Darren Ambrose for Crystal Palace.</i>

09:34.800 --> 09:37.160
<i>He's been the star</i>
<i>of their show this season.</i>

09:37.280 --> 09:40.680
<i>And he just might have kept</i>
<i>Crystal Palace in the Championship.</i>

09:42.160 --> 09:45.320
<i>Long from Spurr,</i>
<i>little flick on from Beevers, it's in!</i>

09:45.880 --> 09:50.640
<i>Darren Purse has scored</i>
<i>for Sheffield Wednesday.</i>

09:50.760 --> 09:53.920
<i>And they are a goal away from safety.</i>

09:53.960 --> 09:56.680
<i>And they have three minutes</i>
<i>in which to find it.</i>

09:56.800 --> 10:00.600
<i>I think there are moments where</i>
<i>you just think fate will take its place.</i>

10:00.680 --> 10:04.720
<i>Well, I was racing at Brands Hatch,</i>
<i>and I was watching on a tiny little TV.</i>

10:04.840 --> 10:08.240
If we hang on,
maybe the next ten years of my life

10:08.320 --> 10:09.680
will be running a football club.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.920
If we don't, maybe it won't.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.000
<i>Darren Ambrose,</i>
<i>2 onto 1 here Crystal Palace.</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:23.560
<i>Darren Ambrose, plays it in to Stern John</i>

10:23.640 --> 10:25.160
<i>and Stern John can finish it!</i>

10:25.560 --> 10:28.840
<i>And Lee Grant makes the save.</i>
<i>And the ball is on the line.</i>

10:28.960 --> 10:30.560
<i>And it's kept out.</i>

10:31.000 --> 10:33.200
<i>You couldn't make it up.</i>
<i>They missed it.</i>

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
We had 7000-8000 of our fans,
they were at the other end of the pitch.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.240
You know, trying to breathe life into us

10:39.320 --> 10:41.760
for the remaining
five or six minutes, and they did.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.240
<i>Up go the heads,</i>
<i>little flick on by Spurr.</i>

10:44.320 --> 10:45.880
<i>It's behind from McCarthy.</i>

10:47.040 --> 10:49.800
<i>It's finished.</i>
<i>Mike Dean's blown his whistle.</i>

10:49.920 --> 10:54.560
<i>Crystal Palace have survived</i>
<i>by the skin of their teeth.</i>

10:54.680 --> 10:57.360
<i>What an unbelievable afternoon.</i>

10:57.760 --> 11:01.800
<i>It ends in unbridled joy</i>
<i>for Crystal Palace.</i>

11:01.880 --> 11:05.000
<i>I mean, the celebrations at the end</i>
<i>will forever be</i>

11:05.080 --> 11:06.440
ingrained in me, it really well.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.080
<i>How do you feel right now?</i>

11:08.200 --> 11:10.680
<i>You've said it, this is</i>
<i>from the bottom of our heart.</i>

11:10.800 --> 11:12.040
I'm gonna cry.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.240
This is the best... The best moment

11:14.280 --> 11:16.680
in my career by a million miles.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.280
Beats the play-offs,
it beats absolutely everything.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.000
<i>These boys, they were unbelievable.</i>

11:22.120 --> 11:26.120
We tried to speak to you on the pitch.
It's a bit calmer in here, I think.

11:33.720 --> 11:37.800
You look back and you reminisce
and you experience them...

11:37.880 --> 11:39.800
Moments that will never
ever be forgotten.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.480
And I think,
everybody looking back on 2010

11:44.440 --> 11:47.600
probably, collectively
understands that it was the...

11:47.680 --> 11:49.280
the rebirth of this football club.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.880
I suppose, in the end,
you get this sense of destiny

12:11.000 --> 12:14.080
or fatalism that, you know, you can't

12:14.200 --> 12:17.000
really avoid it, and you said that
you won't let it go under

12:17.080 --> 12:21.920
because at this point,
liquidation is a real possibility.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.160
<i>When it looked</i>
<i>as if there was a possibility</i>

12:25.280 --> 12:28.360
<i>that Palace could fold,</i>
<i>I think a great many people</i>

12:28.480 --> 12:32.520
thought, "Well, we gotta do whatever
we can to try and stop this happening."

12:32.680 --> 12:35.240
<i>To actually come that close</i>
<i>to maybe going out of business</i>

12:35.360 --> 12:36.760
it was unthinkable, really, to be fair.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.360
There was this spontaneous demonstration
on the bank holiday Monday before

12:40.440 --> 12:43.640
the new owners were going through
the process of trying to get the club.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.200
<i>It was a good couple</i>
<i>of thousand Palace fans</i>

12:45.280 --> 12:47.400
and I remember the Holmesdale Fanatics
coming round the corner

12:47.440 --> 12:50.920
like a medieval Swiss Army
with flags and banners waving.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
<i>It was a very moving</i>
<i>and emotional moment.</i>

12:53.120 --> 12:55.280
They were concerned
that the fans would get

12:55.360 --> 12:58.040
a little bit exuberant
and actually they did.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.280
hey actually got in here.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.120
Despite all the stuff in the media

13:02.200 --> 13:05.880
no one came in for Palace.
So, Steve, I think got the call.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.000
"It's down to you guys,
or it's going into liquidation."

13:09.120 --> 13:12.560
<i>I've always been involved with businesses</i>
<i>that were underdogs so...</i>

13:12.800 --> 13:15.600
I bought a business
that then called Adplates.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.280
And basically, we transformed it

13:18.400 --> 13:21.840
into <i>a global leader</i>
<i>in implementation for marketing.</i>

13:21.920 --> 13:26.040
I'd like a group of investors if you like,
but I wanted them to be Palace fans.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.160
<i>I was from Upper Norwood</i>
<i>where I was brought up</i>

13:30.280 --> 13:31.760
<i>so I always sat in the Arthur Wait</i>

13:31.880 --> 13:34.560
<i>'cause that's the first stand you come to</i>
<i>when you come down Beulah Hill.</i>

13:34.680 --> 13:38.000
I'd never been in a box,
I'd never been in a director's box.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.680
I'd never been, really, anywhere
but the Arthur Wait,

13:40.760 --> 13:43.960
and the odd trip to the Holmesdale
when I was a teenager.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.960
<i>When I was eight or nine,</i>
<i>I went to my first Palace game.</i>

13:47.040 --> 13:48.760
And I've been a supporter ever since.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.440
<i>The idea that there wouldn't</i>
<i>be any Palace anymore</i>

13:51.560 --> 13:52.600
<i>was a big problem.</i>

13:52.680 --> 13:56.280
<i>And I just happened to be</i>
<i>financially able to do something</i>

13:56.400 --> 13:58.840
So I thought it was kind of
my responsibility, really.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.240
<i>Well, Steve had been the back</i>
<i>of the shirt sponsor,</i>

14:01.320 --> 14:02.840
<i>"Tag:" was on the back</i>
<i>of the shirts,</i>

14:02.920 --> 14:05.280
<i>and Martin had been</i>
<i>on the front with "Churchill."</i>

14:06.080 --> 14:08.360
So they knew each other a bit.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.920
And then I heard about this
Steve Parish consortium

14:12.000 --> 14:14.160
and my brother-in-law
works in advertising,

14:14.280 --> 14:15.960
so he got me Steve's number.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.760
And I rung him up and I was kind of hoping
he'd say, "Yeah, we've got a consortium

14:19.840 --> 14:22.000
of seven or eight people
and it's all gonna happen."

14:22.080 --> 14:24.600
But he said to me, "Well, actually
I haven't really got anyone.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.680
I've got a promise from Martin
that he'll help,

14:26.800 --> 14:28.400
but that's it, there is no consortium."

14:28.480 --> 14:31.040
So I said, "Well, you know,
maybe I can do something."

14:31.440 --> 14:36.080
And he got in his car and he was
in my office in about half an hour.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.840
You could tell
he was a decent, brilliant bloke

14:38.920 --> 14:41.440
who just absolutely
loved the club so much.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.400
I said, "All right, well if you can get
four people, I'm in, 25%.

14:45.520 --> 14:49.000
And then we went to see Jeremy Hosking
who'd rung the club out of the blue.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.560
Jeremy was more of an armchair fan.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.840
<i>But Jeremy is very passionate</i>
<i>about Palace.</i>

14:53.960 --> 14:56.240
<i>I've been a Palace fan since 1969.</i>

14:56.360 --> 14:59.560
<i>I was brought up in Upper Norwood,</i>
<i>and Steve, since the early 70's,</i>

14:59.640 --> 15:03.040
<i>brought up in Forest Hill.</i>
<i>Martin was brought up in Streatham.</i>

15:03.120 --> 15:05.600
And has been going
the longest of all of us.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.760
So, yeah, all of us did it because
it was Palace, absolutely.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.920
Looking at the deal in detail became
more apparent just how complicated it was.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.200
There was clearly very little future
for a football club

15:15.320 --> 15:17.400
that didn't own its own stadium.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.720
<i>It goes back to the time of Ron Noades.</i>

15:19.800 --> 15:22.960
<i>So Ron Noades owned the whole thing.</i>

15:23.040 --> 15:26.160
<i>Mark Goldberg came along</i>
<i>rather naively.</i>

15:26.280 --> 15:28.040
<i>Paid too much for it.</i>

15:28.160 --> 15:30.240
<i>Couldn't afford to pay</i>
<i>for it all in the end,</i>

15:30.360 --> 15:32.240
<i>so Ron Noades kept the stadium.</i>

15:32.480 --> 15:33.840
<i>That all went south,</i>

15:33.920 --> 15:37.520
<i>and then Simon Jordan bought</i>
<i>the club, but didn't own the stadium.</i>

15:37.640 --> 15:40.440
He then claimed that he had bought
the stadium, but he hadn't.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.960
<i>The company that owned the stadium,</i>
<i>Rock Investments</i>

15:43.080 --> 15:46.720
<i>had gone into administration,</i>
<i>was effectively then owned by a bank,</i>

15:46.840 --> 15:49.720
<i>HBOS, and then the bank,</i>
<i>because of the financial crisis</i>

15:49.800 --> 15:51.280
<i>went into administration.</i>

15:51.360 --> 15:54.320
The government told
Lloyds Bank to take over HBOS.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.760
So the bank ended up owning this
little piece of South London.

15:58.840 --> 16:04.080
Which left us trying to negotiate
a price on a piece of land

16:04.200 --> 16:07.680
and they paid 12 million
for some reason for the stadium.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.520
I think because they wanted to develop it
as flats or whatever.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.080
And of course, we were offering them
3-3.5 as it was a football stadium.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.640
So it was a desperately
complicated situation.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.080
And one that didn't look like
it could be unlocked

16:20.160 --> 16:22.320
because we just couldn't get
anybody to pay attention.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.040
Steve created an account
called "CPFC2010",

16:31.160 --> 16:34.320
on the bulletin board, put a message,
explaining the situation.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.040
<i>I just couldn't see how it could be done.</i>

16:36.160 --> 16:40.600
I sat on my sofa, and probably learned
the power of football

16:40.680 --> 16:41.920
in everybody's lives.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.000
<i>Wrote a statement outlining</i>
<i>why it was impossible</i>

16:45.040 --> 16:46.320
<i>and it just wouldn't happen.</i>

16:46.440 --> 16:49.160
Within five seconds, it seemed,
it was running

16:49.280 --> 16:51.880
as a banner underneath
the Sky Sports News, it was going out

16:51.960 --> 16:53.880
and <i>the note that I had sent</i>

16:53.920 --> 16:57.120
precipitated an incredible chain of events.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.640
<i>And the next day I woke up,</i>

17:14.720 --> 17:17.680
and there were 3000 fans
outside Lloyds Bank in London.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.680
<i>And very, very quickly</i>
<i>we received a phone call saying,</i>

17:20.800 --> 17:23.840
<i>"Look, we need to sit down and talk</i>
<i>to you about this football stadium."</i>

17:25.320 --> 17:29.320
You don't normally get the administrator
of a failing business to sell it,

17:29.400 --> 17:32.160
because its customers
gets so worked up on television.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.520
<i>But that really was brilliant,</i>
<i>the way the fans</i>

17:34.600 --> 17:37.160
<i>got behind the club</i>
<i>and almost forced their hand</i>

17:37.240 --> 17:39.400
<i>to make them sell the club to us.</i>

17:41.160 --> 17:44.640
What Steve did and what the fans did
by protesting at Lloyds

17:44.760 --> 17:46.960
was persuade them that they had to sell it

17:47.040 --> 17:49.720
at a reasonable price
to the owners of the club.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.000
<i>And it couldn't be re-developed.</i>

17:51.040 --> 17:53.280
Sales of the players have been delayed.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.080
A deal is close.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.800
I said, "Look, let's just make it
25% each.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.560
I just wanna get the club
back on its feet."

18:07.680 --> 18:09.760
And the four of us just agreed
to do it between us,

18:09.840 --> 18:12.160
on a handshake,
there was nothing written down.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.800
And it was such trust, I didn't have
a deal with the other three guys.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.200
So I signed for the club effectively
and bought it

18:18.280 --> 18:21.440
and then the other three came in
as they promised with their funding.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.520
<i>It was an amazing</i>
<i>and incredibly complicated deal</i>

18:24.640 --> 18:25.880
<i>which Steve pulled off.</i>

18:26.000 --> 18:27.880
<i>So we ended up owning a football club.</i>

18:28.480 --> 18:31.960
<i>The fans unlocked the whole situation.</i>

18:32.680 --> 18:35.680
The last two owners
had ended in financial peril.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.480
It affected them, not just business-wise,

18:38.560 --> 18:41.560
it affected them personally,
so people were really worried around me,

18:41.640 --> 18:43.600
"Why have you done this?"
You know.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.560
<i>And I remember saying to somebody,</i>

18:45.640 --> 18:49.360
<i>"Because it made me think about it,</i>
<i>because it matters."</i>

18:49.440 --> 18:51.800
<i>And in your life something has to matter.</i>

18:51.880 --> 18:55.600
<i>You know, after your family,</i>
<i>and your business, and things.</i>

18:56.240 --> 18:59.600
But what matters, you know,
for most of us, it's our football team.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.120
Yeah, I'm not really one for celebrating
after an event,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.000
I think, I like to try and take it in.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.880
And I was in the shower
and from a distance actually looking

19:36.960 --> 19:38.880
<i>and getting more enjoyment</i>
<i>out of the scene</i>

19:38.960 --> 19:42.560
very relieved people. You know,
there were some real good characters

19:42.680 --> 19:45.520
in that dressing room
and they wanted to stand by each other.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.320
And they wanted the club.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.200
Yes, to be taken over by the right people,
but they wanted to leave the club

19:51.320 --> 19:54.000
in the right position, and one or two knew
they were gonna leave the club,

19:54.080 --> 19:56.240
but they wanted to leave
it in a real good place,

19:56.360 --> 19:58.800
so the new owners could come in
and that was in the championship.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.040
And, really, that was
the achievement for me,

20:01.120 --> 20:05.000
<i>that people going beyond their selves</i>
<i>for a football club.</i>

20:05.080 --> 20:08.200
<i>You know we had a very tough,</i>
<i>sort of, maybe, two years</i>

20:08.280 --> 20:12.280
<i>and it was the four guys that I presented</i>
<i>to them my findings of the football club</i>

20:12.360 --> 20:16.400
<i>over the last 10-12 years,</i>
<i>and what I see going forward</i>

20:16.520 --> 20:18.800
<i>the short term goal should look like.</i>

20:18.920 --> 20:21.960
<i>And that was my first experience</i>
<i>of four individuals</i>

20:22.040 --> 20:24.600
being very comfortable with each other,

20:24.720 --> 20:28.040
and very comfortable listening
and very comfortable

20:28.160 --> 20:29.960
telling you their views
and where they are.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.200
Well, I was a bit star struck
the first time I met Dougie

20:33.280 --> 20:36.400
<i>'cause he is way up the list</i>
<i>of all time goal-scorers.</i>

20:36.480 --> 20:38.440
He's just behind Wright and Bright,
I think, isn't he?

20:38.520 --> 20:41.600
He'd been at Palace
on two separate occasions.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.160
He was a great player for us.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.120
Very quickly, when you get involved,
you realize

20:46.240 --> 20:49.600
running a football club is like
running no other business.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.280
<i>It's completely unique.</i>

20:51.360 --> 20:52.960
<i>Obviously, you come into it</i>
<i>quite naively,</i>

20:53.080 --> 20:54.360
he's got a great business brain...

20:54.480 --> 20:57.040
...but football is totally different
than any other business.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.520
When I first got involved with the club,

20:58.600 --> 21:00.640
Mark Bright used to come
with me to every game.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.000
It's invaluable having somebody
who really understands football

21:04.080 --> 21:06.800
and has played the game
when you're on that learning curve.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.520
And what's more important was
he didn't ask anything for it.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.120
It was just his own love of the club
was the reason that he did it.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.680
You always feel it's your club
and you're trying to help

21:15.760 --> 21:17.640
the guy who has bought it.
And, you know, I was just there

21:17.720 --> 21:19.280
to assist in any way.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.080
Football is a situation
where most people care mostly

21:22.760 --> 21:25.560
about their career and themselves,
and there's not a lot of loyalty,

21:25.680 --> 21:27.680
but if you can get people that care,

21:27.760 --> 21:30.360
even a little bit about your club,
and what you're trying to do,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.760
then it's really invaluable.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.800
<i>When I bought the club he did</i>
<i>the academy kids for no money.</i>

21:35.880 --> 21:38.080
<i>On a Thursday night he would</i>
<i>go down there and he would take them</i>

21:38.200 --> 21:41.440
<i>to show them finishing,</i>
<i>an excellent human being, Mark Bright.</i>

21:41.560 --> 21:44.080
<i>So, the first summer was obviously</i>
<i>a massive challenge.</i>

21:44.200 --> 21:46.640
<i>We'd lost key players,</i>
<i>Shaun Derry, Clint Hill,</i>

21:46.720 --> 21:49.680
<i>I don't know how many professional</i>
<i>players we had, six or seven.</i>

21:50.080 --> 21:52.280
<i>It was very much a skeleton staff,</i>

21:52.360 --> 21:55.560
<i>I mean, Phil Alexander was running it,</i>
<i>Dougie was at the training ground</i>

21:55.680 --> 21:57.320
<i>with not many other people.</i>

21:57.400 --> 21:59.720
It was really starting
from scratch, almost.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.920
I was a pretty average centre-half,
really.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.640
Played lower league. Was never really
good enough to play

22:08.760 --> 22:10.080
any higher than League One, League Two.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.880
I had two seasons at Bournemouth,
around about the time

22:13.000 --> 22:14.160
Eddie Howe had taken over.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.840
And the opportunity came up
to come to Palace.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.920
<i>So I came down for an interview,</i>

22:19.040 --> 22:22.720
<i>if you could call it an interview.</i>
<i>I think it was a 15-minute chat.</i>

22:22.840 --> 22:25.160
I had sort of played
League One, League Two,

22:25.280 --> 22:28.240
all my career
and was a little bit surprised

22:28.320 --> 22:30.880
by what was here when I first arrived.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.480
When I arrived, the infrastructure
of the club had gone.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.400
<i>The stadium was barely standing</i>
<i>on its own two feet.</i>

22:36.800 --> 22:38.400
<i>We didn't own a training ground.</i>

22:38.520 --> 22:40.640
The academy was basically
some porta cabins.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.680
<i>And some staff.</i>
<i>It was a massively under-invested,</i>

22:44.800 --> 22:46.360
<i>under-loved football club</i>

22:46.440 --> 22:48.280
that was on the brink
of going out of business.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.280
I remember the first thing we did
was say to Dougie,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.840
<i>"Right, Speroni and Ambrose,</i>
<i>you gotta get them to stay,</i>

22:52.920 --> 22:54.440
<i>'cause they were our favourite players</i>

22:54.520 --> 22:56.280
<i>and rumours were</i>
<i>they were about to leave."</i>

22:56.360 --> 22:57.880
<i>We did a contract with Darren Ambrose</i>

22:57.920 --> 22:59.760
<i>because obviously,</i>
<i>he was very important to us.</i>

22:59.880 --> 23:02.520
Yeah, I was close, I had offers
from other clubs,

23:02.600 --> 23:04.080
but then Phil said to me,

23:04.160 --> 23:06.920
"If you're happy, they want to make you
an offer for you to stay."

23:07.000 --> 23:09.440
And I thought,
"Well, if that's on the table then,

23:09.560 --> 23:10.640
there's no other option for me."

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
You know, I want to stay,
I always wanted to stay.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.400
Over here, we have Speroni's Restaurant.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.000
Named aptly after Julián Speroni,
our goalkeeper.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.520
The owners wanted to give
the best for the fans

23:25.640 --> 23:27.840
and the club, and take the club
that effectively was,

23:27.920 --> 23:29.160
you know, in a bad way,

23:29.280 --> 23:31.040
and really pull it forward,
and they have done so.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.360
<i>First season was kind of exciting,</i>
<i>it was my first season here as well.</i>

23:34.480 --> 23:36.560
<i>Coming in at such a positive time,</i>

23:36.680 --> 23:38.720
<i>was really great for me, certainly,</i>
<i>in marketing too,</i>

23:38.760 --> 23:41.360
because people are up for it,
people are energetic about it,

23:41.480 --> 23:42.760
and they're excited about the future,

23:42.840 --> 23:46.120
<i>and you know, showed how much heart</i>
<i>and passion the club's actually got.</i>

23:46.200 --> 23:49.560
They don't really stand on ceremonies,
Steve Parish walked up here now,

23:49.640 --> 23:52.000
<i>first thing he does when he sees me,</i>
<i>we always say, "Hello,"</i>

23:52.080 --> 23:54.160
<i>and we hug and that's the same</i>
<i>for all four of them.</i>

23:54.240 --> 23:56.440
No one's afraid
to actually speak to them.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.440
<i>When they took over, it was,</i>
<i>"Right, we've saved the club,</i>

23:59.520 --> 24:00.640
from extinction here.

24:00.720 --> 24:04.120
<i>We're gonna be running it</i>
<i>on a sound basis."</i>

24:04.240 --> 24:07.720
There was no particular desire
to own a football club,

24:07.840 --> 24:10.200
or to run a football club<i>.</i>

24:10.320 --> 24:13.800
<i>Or any of the reasons other people</i>
<i>might have to buy a football club.</i>

24:13.920 --> 24:15.440
I just wanted go to Palace.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.720
I think everybody kind of knew, right,
nothing's gonna change overnight.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.400
These guys are saving us, no question,
but they are not ploughing in billions.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.600
<i>They're not Arab sheikhs.</i>

24:25.680 --> 24:28.480
<i>Loads of the clubs that've just gone mad</i>

24:28.640 --> 24:30.800
and like, let's just spend
loads of money,

24:30.880 --> 24:33.880
and be glamorous,
and someone, somewhere going,

24:34.000 --> 24:38.560
"We owe 180 billion pounds,
we're now the sole reason

24:38.680 --> 24:40.920
for the global economic catastrophe."

24:41.040 --> 24:43.400
"Yeah! But we got to the semi-final
of the Carling Cup."

24:43.520 --> 24:45.800
There's no showman amongst them,
and you know

24:45.920 --> 24:48.360
<i>we've been used to one</i>
<i>or two showmen in the past.</i>

24:48.440 --> 24:51.560
We've had a succession of people
in the last 30 years

24:51.640 --> 24:53.440
come along and say,
"You know, if I take this club over

24:53.560 --> 24:55.000
we can make this the Arsenal
of South London."

24:55.080 --> 24:58.000
The one thing you hear from
other clubs a lot is like,

24:58.080 --> 25:00.200
"Who are these people running my club?
Who are they?"

25:00.280 --> 25:02.040
I don't know who they...
You never see them.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.240
You know, these shadowy figures
making decisions

25:04.320 --> 25:06.680
and I've never felt that with these guys.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.120
And you can't put a price on that.
You really can't.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.880
<i>And I like the way, from the start,</i>
<i>they were really open with the fans,</i>

25:12.960 --> 25:14.920
<i>holding fans' forums,</i>
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

25:15.040 --> 25:17.920
<i>And they just made us feel</i>
<i>like a part of it again.</i>

25:18.000 --> 25:20.480
In a way, you just need
to wipe the slate clean,

25:20.560 --> 25:22.160
and that's kind of what we did.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.800
<i>I remember going</i>
<i>to the first fans' forum,</i>

25:24.920 --> 25:27.120
<i>and telling everybody that I thought</i>
<i>we could get promoted.</i>

25:27.200 --> 25:29.840
Everybody thought I was crazy,
but I knew this club.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.560
<i>I know how special it is.</i>

25:33.440 --> 25:35.440
<i>And the play-off system</i>
<i>in the championship</i>

25:35.520 --> 25:38.400
<i>just gives you that chance to get</i>
<i>to the top division.</i>

25:39.200 --> 25:42.360
Perhaps naively,
perhaps... we wanted to run Palace

25:42.480 --> 25:45.720
on a sensible break-even basis,

25:45.840 --> 25:47.480
what we want is
a manager who's done well

25:47.560 --> 25:49.160
on a limited budget
in the championship,

25:49.280 --> 25:51.320
<i>and you know, George Burley</i>
<i>fitted the bill well.</i>

25:51.400 --> 25:52.920
<i>It was all about staying in the league</i>

25:53.080 --> 25:55.760
that first year, we didn't really have
any aspirations beyond that.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
<i>Dougie was assistant.</i>

25:56.920 --> 26:00.000
There were quite a few meetings
with Dougie early on in Steve's office.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.800
He was really important in persuading
some players to stay,

26:03.920 --> 26:05.400
and, you know, he was great, Dougie.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.240
I was really happy,
and really comfortable,

26:08.360 --> 26:09.800
<i>you know, working beside George.</i>

26:09.880 --> 26:11.480
<i>But the first season was tough.</i>

26:11.600 --> 26:14.480
<i>Really tough and we were close</i>
<i>to being relegated.</i>

26:15.120 --> 26:17.760
<i>Jason Puncheon, who has such</i>
<i>a big part in our history</i>

26:17.880 --> 26:20.880
<i>had another big part in our history</i>
<i>by scoring a hat-trick against us.</i>

26:21.720 --> 26:24.520
<i>And Steve was sitting next</i>
<i>to me in the director's box</i>

26:24.600 --> 26:28.160
and he was scribbling,
and I looked, "Oh."

26:28.240 --> 26:31.600
It appears that George
is gonna have to go.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.400
And I think George knew as well because

26:34.520 --> 26:37.400
it was the one and only time he let me
have a team talk after the game.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.360
And I think he'd known that he'd done
as much as he possibly could.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.320
<i>And that really hurt me, that defeat.</i>

26:42.440 --> 26:44.480
It affected a few people
in the dressing room.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.480
The chairman, Steve,
had come into the dressing room,

26:46.600 --> 26:49.440
and he just said
just three simple words to me,

26:49.480 --> 26:51.160
"You're taking training
on Monday morning."

26:56.720 --> 27:00.720
<i>Big manager search, we spoke</i>
<i>to lots of different people,</i>

27:00.800 --> 27:03.120
and then landed on Eddie Howe.

27:03.160 --> 27:06.760
I was in my office one evening
and he was here.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.240
Walked into the office,
I think he was being shown around.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.640
<i>Unfortunately they didn't realize</i>
<i>I was still here.</i>

27:11.760 --> 27:14.960
<i>And I ran into Eddie, yeah. He sort of</i>
<i>stuck his head through the door</i>

27:15.040 --> 27:17.240
and made a quick getaway
as soon as he saw me.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.120
When the rumours were it was Eddie,
that's when I started

27:20.240 --> 27:22.360
thinking for the club, really.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.480
You know, due respect to Eddie,

27:24.560 --> 27:25.960
I didn't think he was capable
of doing the job

27:26.080 --> 27:28.240
that was needed at that time
and keep us in the division.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.760
And I agreed everything with Eddie.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.320
And then woke up the next morning,
he'd gone to Burnley.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.760
<i>Obviously</i>
<i>another lesson about football.</i>

27:34.880 --> 27:36.800
<i>But that really galvanized Dougie</i>

27:36.920 --> 27:39.360
<i>who hadn't really made representations</i>
<i>up to that point.</i>

27:39.400 --> 27:42.280
<i>I remember, he demanded to...</i>
<i>You know, I need to see you.</i>

27:42.400 --> 27:45.400
I said to Steve one day
that I was disappointed

27:45.440 --> 27:46.800
that I hadn't been spoken to.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.680
And he sat in my office
and just showed me

27:49.800 --> 27:51.640
that he really believed he could do it.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.520
Believed he was
the right person to do it.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.880
He said, "Look, Eddie is a great guy
and he is a great manager,

27:55.920 --> 27:59.840
but I know South London,
I know these kids,

27:59.880 --> 28:01.720
I know how this place ticks.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.680
What we're gonna try
and do is difficult to impossible,

28:04.720 --> 28:08.760
but I think we can. And I think I can."

28:08.800 --> 28:12.960
<i>What I knew was we needed a manager</i>
<i>that didn't think it was impossible.</i>

28:13.200 --> 28:14.640
I interviewed a lot of managers.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.680
And you could hear in their voice
they didn't really believe

28:17.800 --> 28:19.480
we had much of a chance of anything.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.600
But I could see around football,
I'd seen it for years,

28:21.640 --> 28:24.000
how the impossible can happen.
I certainly didn't think

28:24.040 --> 28:27.480
spending crazy money
was necessarily a recipe for success.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.680
And to my surprise and delight,

28:29.720 --> 28:32.280
Steve come in the next day
and said, "You've got the job."

28:32.360 --> 28:35.080
We shook hands on it.
We didn't do a contract or anything.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.520
Dougie was just the perfect choice
because he cares about the club.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.800
Dougie took training
while George was here anyway.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.160
So Dougie was very competent
on the grass.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.200
If anything, it'd become
more organized under Dougie.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.000
Very focused and structured coach.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.280
I think it was a little bit of a relief
when Dougie was announced.

28:51.400 --> 28:55.240
<i>So after I appointed Dougie, it was just</i>
<i>the most enjoyable period really.</i>

28:55.280 --> 28:58.440
<i>'Cause that next six months</i>
<i>was pretty much all hands to the pump.</i>

28:58.480 --> 29:00.280
<i>And getting people moving</i>
<i>in the right direction</i>

29:00.400 --> 29:03.520
<i>and giving people a purpose</i>
<i>of what this club is all about.</i>

29:04.680 --> 29:08.360
<i>Having fans as owners</i>
<i>and then also having Dougie,</i>

29:08.480 --> 29:12.200
who'd been such a Palace legend
and something of a fan himself

29:12.320 --> 29:14.360
-taking over as manager...<i>-It felt special.</i>

29:14.480 --> 29:17.040
<i>Our manager was so much part</i>
<i>of the fabric of this club.</i>

29:17.160 --> 29:20.160
Dougie was obviously a former player,
former hero of the club.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.440
<i>Former legend, I think,</i>
<i>it's fair to say that.</i>

29:22.560 --> 29:25.000
He's one of those guys,
there's a handful of guys

29:25.040 --> 29:27.800
who've scored a 100 goals for the club
and Dougie's one of them.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.320
<i>Most Palace remember him</i>
<i>as very much a flair player,</i>

29:30.440 --> 29:34.040
<i>but as a manager I think</i>
<i>he was very focused on not losing.</i>

29:34.080 --> 29:35.960
'Cause we didn't really have
enough goals in us.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.040
So, you know, we were very defensive,
very solid, compact.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.000
<i>Tony Popovic, Lennie Lawrence,</i>
<i>you know, good coaches and we stayed up.</i>

29:43.120 --> 29:46.600
And then that summer
I felt really confident in myself

29:46.720 --> 29:49.800
knowing the missing pieces to the jigsaw.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.160
I learned an enormous amount from Dougie.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.640
It was a massive learning curve
for both of us.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.680
Going after players together,
learning about the game,

29:57.800 --> 30:00.840
it was brilliant, I absolutely loved
every minute of it.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.440
And the best feeling, again,
for me was everybody doubted us.

30:04.520 --> 30:08.960
Really gave me, you know,
that desire to want to prove that we can.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.880
We've always had youthful players
running around in the squad and team,

30:11.920 --> 30:14.840
which makes it very vibrant
and very energetic.

30:30.680 --> 30:35.040
<i>It's a very family-oriented club.</i>
<i>The love is genuine.</i>

30:35.080 --> 30:38.280
Whether you're doing, well or not,
people tend to care.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.280
Like, as a player here,
the love I receive from the fans,

30:42.360 --> 30:45.880
even if I'm walking on the street
or I'm going to Tesco or something,

30:45.920 --> 30:48.680
I see a fan, he'll who generally ask,
"How are you doing today, Wilfried?"

30:48.720 --> 30:51.800
How's your family and stuff like that.
And it's rare

30:51.920 --> 30:55.800
because not every team sees footballers
as human beings.

30:55.920 --> 31:00.120
So this club is definitely a family
and there's genuine love here.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.480
<i>I grew up in Thornton Heath.</i>

31:02.600 --> 31:06.800
On a road that was like
30-second walk from the stadium.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.800
<i>A road called Rothesay road.</i>

31:08.840 --> 31:11.040
<i>I was right next to the stadium</i>
<i>and I used to see the lights</i>

31:11.120 --> 31:15.080
in there all the time and I used to feel,
"What is going on in there?"

31:15.160 --> 31:19.480
Few years later, I started to...
I got scouted for Crystal Palace

31:19.640 --> 31:21.960
and yeah, here we are now.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.880
To be honest, I was just getting
used to the first team obviously.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.960
<i>When I first came,</i>
<i>there was Paddy McCarthy</i>

31:28.000 --> 31:29.240
<i>and it was a bit different.</i>

31:29.360 --> 31:32.320
I was just getting to understanding
my surroundings, really,

31:32.360 --> 31:34.800
and just learning my trade.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.600
<i>Understanding the responsibility</i>

31:36.680 --> 31:38.680
<i>that you have when you play</i>
<i>men's football.</i>

31:38.800 --> 31:40.400
<i>I was just observing everything.</i>

31:40.480 --> 31:43.240
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>when I joined the first team,</i>

31:43.320 --> 31:47.240
I went through a whole season
of just traveling and not playing.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.480
'Cause obviously sometimes that's what
you have to do as a young player.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.720
<i>So when I got my chance,</i>
<i>I just made sure I took it.</i>

32:02.640 --> 32:07.200
<i>From the moment we discovered that we had</i>
<i>a player like Wilf, we had Jonny,</i>

32:07.320 --> 32:11.040
<i>we had two players that we probably</i>
<i>would never be able to afford even then.</i>

32:11.160 --> 32:13.640
So I looked at
what the value of the squad was

32:13.760 --> 32:15.800
rather than what we paid for it.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.000
I believed that we could get there.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.920
<i>I just remember</i>
<i>the Sheffield Wednesday game,</i>

32:29.000 --> 32:31.880
<i>sat at home, my whole family</i>
<i>was around the TV watching.</i>

32:31.920 --> 32:34.760
<i>It started to get real though,</i>
<i>thinking about having to leave Palace.</i>

32:34.880 --> 32:37.960
And I thought, "Oh, I don't wanna leave.
I love Palace."

32:38.000 --> 32:39.160
Amazing outcome.

32:39.200 --> 32:42.000
And it's great work
the owners have done here.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.480
<i>I was eight years old.</i>

32:46.600 --> 32:49.040
I went to a community centre
in Sevenoaks.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.320
They took us to a six-week trial
just over the road

32:52.440 --> 32:54.480
where there used to be astro
at the back of the training ground.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.280
At the end of the six-week trial,
they signed me on for a year.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.520
And I left Tonbridge Angels
and started playing for Palace.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.320
Yeah, long time ago now.

33:04.120 --> 33:09.040
<i>It's changed a lot to be fair in a way,</i>
<i>but to me it's still the same, you know.</i>

33:09.160 --> 33:11.960
Crazy. I played my first under-eight game
just on that pitch.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.880
That first pitch. And I still remember,
we played Tottenham.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.360
That was like, it's nearly,
20 years ago I guess.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.640
So it brings back so many memories.

33:22.880 --> 33:25.840
Grew up in Tonbridge.
I went to school in Tonbridge Wells.

33:25.920 --> 33:30.560
In the middle of Palace,
Brighton, Charlton, Millwall.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.840
We would play here at Copers Cope
in the morning,

33:32.880 --> 33:34.840
and then we'd come watch Palace
on the Saturday,

33:34.920 --> 33:37.560
so pretty much turned into a Palace fan.

33:38.120 --> 33:41.120
<i>You felt like there's a real sense,</i>
<i>you'd get a chance under these managers.</i>

33:41.160 --> 33:44.840
<i>You felt like there's a real pathway</i>
<i>from the academy into the first team.</i>

33:44.960 --> 33:47.160
It's about making your chance
and working hard,

33:47.200 --> 33:50.000
and probably the most intense training
I've ever had in my career.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.600
<i>They got me ready</i>
<i>for that transition</i>

33:51.680 --> 33:53.800
<i>into Dougie's first team.</i>

33:54.840 --> 33:57.640
<i>We were playing Wycombe away</i>
<i>in a pre-season friendly.</i>

33:57.720 --> 34:01.400
Three like youngsters or kids,
so I was one of them. I was only 17.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.920
<i>Dougie just said, "You're on,"</i>

34:04.040 --> 34:07.840
go and express yourself kind of thing,
so that was my real chance.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.280
And I had a good game.

34:09.320 --> 34:13.120
<i>I didn't really look back ever since.</i>
<i>Just kept playing without fear, really.</i>

34:15.520 --> 34:17.760
The thing with a club like Palace is,

34:17.800 --> 34:20.120
<i>we have to get players</i>
<i>from within our community.</i>

34:20.160 --> 34:22.840
And we have always been really proud
of our youth system here.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.680
There's a huge feather
in the cap of our academy.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.840
<i>People are getting to know now.</i>

34:27.880 --> 34:30.640
<i>So it was our academy players,</i>
<i>even way back to the cup finals</i>

34:30.720 --> 34:33.600
<i>I played in '95 and '96</i>
<i>all the way up to right now.</i>

34:33.640 --> 34:36.040
<i>I get quite a little glow of pride when</i>
<i>you look around the Premier League</i>

34:36.080 --> 34:38.160
<i>and you see Ben Watson scoring</i>
<i>and you see Victor Moses,</i>

34:38.280 --> 34:39.560
<i>you say, "Yeah, we made those players."</i>

34:39.680 --> 34:42.520
When you see a player
like Wilfried Zaha coming through

34:42.600 --> 34:45.120
and when you follow him from a young age
and when you see him develop...

34:45.160 --> 34:47.520
And it's a club that's in his heart.
Always will be.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.160
He is always entertaining.

34:49.240 --> 34:52.560
Even if nothing comes of it, you know,
he'll go around three players.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.800
And that's just brilliant.

34:54.840 --> 34:58.480
And we all know
on his day he's almost unplayable.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.200
He's a special player.
He's a real special player.

35:01.240 --> 35:05.000
<i>And he's got special physical attributes.</i>
<i>Pace, power, trickery.</i>

35:05.440 --> 35:07.600
He was always the same wild spirit.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.920
He was just a kid
that wanted to play football.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.320
He didn't care about anything else.
You know, give him the ball

35:12.440 --> 35:14.080
and then watch what he does.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.120
Similar to what he is now,
he's just so, so talented,

35:17.200 --> 35:20.520
with an amazing mind-set
that he had from a young age.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.800
<i>He didn't really care</i>
<i>when another player would give him grief.</i>

35:23.920 --> 35:25.960
He knew what his best abilities were.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.960
And I'm just glad he hasn't changed that
because he was always like that as a kid.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.240
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>stood him out from the rest.</i>

35:32.800 --> 35:37.640
The catchment area of the club
is its golden benefit.

35:37.720 --> 35:42.440
<i>I've spent lot of time talking to Ron</i>
<i>about his strategy for Palace.</i>

35:42.480 --> 35:44.680
You blood the young players
in the first year<i>,</i>

35:44.720 --> 35:47.680
build some seasoned pros around them.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.400
And then in the second year
you got experience in the youngsters.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.480
And you've got a team that's capable
of promotion or the play-offs.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.360
I knew the character and the personality
and the technical aspects

36:02.400 --> 36:04.000
of a player that gets promoted.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.000
If you're gonna spend
10-15 million pounds on a player,

36:06.040 --> 36:08.440
you can make anything happen,
but if you don't have any money,

36:08.520 --> 36:10.240
you want free transfers
or small amounts of money,

36:10.320 --> 36:12.800
<i>then you've got to look</i>
<i>at those opportunities that exist.</i>

36:12.840 --> 36:14.680
<i>And then I went around identifying</i>

36:14.720 --> 36:16.920
<i>what players in the lower leagues</i>
<i>we could get.</i>

36:17.040 --> 36:18.880
We didn't have a lot of money,
which was great

36:18.920 --> 36:21.560
because it made people
really think and work at it.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.600
Dougie would scour the country
for players in between games.

36:25.720 --> 36:29.360
It was his ability to identify players.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.760
I felt right down
the spine of the football club,

36:31.800 --> 36:34.600
you know, we needed strong characters,
strong leaderships.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.440
There was always somebody
out-spending us by miles.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.400
It really was an art form

36:39.480 --> 36:41.800
<i>getting these players to Crystal Palace.</i>

36:49.120 --> 36:51.680
<i>Strong, square-jawed and determined,</i>

36:52.480 --> 36:55.040
<i>it's Mile Jedinak to strike it!</i>

37:01.720 --> 37:03.920
<i>And the man from Down Under</i>

37:03.960 --> 37:07.360
<i>has just turned Liverpool's world</i>
<i>upside down.</i>

37:16.840 --> 37:20.240
<i>Grew up in the west of Sydney,</i>
<i>a suburb called Rooty Hill.</i>

37:20.280 --> 37:23.480
<i>The earliest memories</i>
<i>were playing football with my brother</i>

37:23.520 --> 37:26.520
<i>and trying</i>
<i>to just get involved in the game.</i>

37:26.640 --> 37:29.960
Going and watching my local team,
Sydney United,

37:30.080 --> 37:32.720
<i>who we supported</i>
<i>through the Croatian community.</i>

37:32.800 --> 37:35.360
<i>It's the team I'd end up</i>
<i>going and playing for the first team for.</i>

37:35.400 --> 37:38.920
I had one eye on representing Australia
at a World Cup<i>.</i>

37:38.960 --> 37:42.480
<i>I thought my best way to do that</i>
<i>would be trying my luck overseas</i>

37:42.600 --> 37:44.560
<i>in a league that was</i>
<i>going to be difficult and foreign</i>

37:44.600 --> 37:47.240
<i>and all that comes with it.</i>
<i>When I decided on that, I was all in</i>

37:47.360 --> 37:49.400
and never really looked back.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.480
<i>Tony Popovic said, "Look, there's</i>
<i>a certain profile that's playing</i>

37:51.600 --> 37:53.520
<i>for the national team. He's in Turkey."</i>

37:53.640 --> 37:55.720
They were playing Germany,
in fact, in the march.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.280
We went and seen him
and straight away he was perfect.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.280
You know, the size for the championship,
he was very durable,

38:01.320 --> 38:03.960
the endurance Mile brung to the team
was fantastic.

38:04.080 --> 38:08.120
You know, I spoke to Tony maybe once.
They had seen what they had seen.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.640
<i>We did beat Germany that game as well,</i>
<i>so it was a great victory for us.</i>

38:11.760 --> 38:13.400
I knew Crystal Palace, you know.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.760
<i>I had roomed with Nicky Carle</i>
<i>that played for Palace.</i>

38:15.800 --> 38:18.400
<i>I know he worked</i>
<i>under Neil Warnock and whatnot,</i>

38:18.480 --> 38:20.840
<i>but, you know, having had</i>
<i>the conversation with Tony</i>

38:20.880 --> 38:24.040
<i>and then subsequently later with Dougie,</i>

38:24.120 --> 38:27.120
quite quickly I realized
that I wanted to be a part of...

38:27.240 --> 38:30.480
You know, I can see this is something
that I'm really intrigued by.

38:30.560 --> 38:34.360
And then for that summer,
you know, I just convinced his wife

38:34.480 --> 38:36.720
that he should come to Crystal Palace.
They were having a baby at the time.

38:36.760 --> 38:40.280
And I told a few white lies
that you can have your baby

38:40.320 --> 38:42.200
where the Queen has her baby
in the Portland

38:42.320 --> 38:44.160
and the club,
that's where the cost will be used

38:44.200 --> 38:47.000
and, you know, Mile's family
to come to Crystal Palace.

38:47.560 --> 38:51.440
I don't know if it was like that but they
did offer to pay for the hospital.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.880
I think that was probably one of things
that sealed the deal.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.840
The reassurance of,
"We'll look after you no matter what."

38:56.920 --> 38:58.480
You know, very nice gesture.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.880
Mile was literally just a tank.

39:01.920 --> 39:05.320
Like, I just remember him
bundling people over.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.280
And the funny thing is that
the Mile you saw after,

39:08.320 --> 39:10.720
there was a transition,
a smooth transition.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.920
Like, he came with the big bushy hair
and all that stuff,

39:13.960 --> 39:16.120
<i>then afterwards</i>
<i>it just all fell into place</i>

39:16.160 --> 39:18.760
<i>and he just became this loud warrior</i>
<i>for the team.</i>

39:18.800 --> 39:20.200
<i>I think that was the thing with Mile,</i>

39:20.320 --> 39:22.360
he set the standard very early on
when he came in.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.680
Once you are there,
you get immersed in all of it

39:24.800 --> 39:28.160
and I was one who definitely
got immersed in everything

39:28.240 --> 39:31.640
<i>that Crystal Palace is</i>
<i>and what Crystal Palace will always be.</i>

39:31.720 --> 39:33.800
The name doesn't mean a lot to me.
Who they play for,

39:33.840 --> 39:35.160
that doesn't mean a lot to me.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.440
<i>I'll travel to the end of the world</i>
<i>to find the profile what I'm looking for.</i>

39:56.480 --> 40:00.240
<i>From up in Cumbria,</i>
<i>not a very footballing place,</i>

40:00.360 --> 40:02.840
<i>probably a rugby league stronghold.</i>

40:02.920 --> 40:06.080
<i>But that was one thing</i>
<i>that I enjoyed at Palace.</i>

40:06.200 --> 40:09.280
<i>The area reminded me</i>
<i>of my area from home.</i>

40:09.360 --> 40:11.960
<i>And people sort of supporting</i>
<i>their local club.</i>

40:12.080 --> 40:13.640
And that working-class background,

40:13.680 --> 40:17.120
and that is something that made me feel
at home at Palace.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.120
<i>I'd just gotten to a job</i>
<i>that was gonna keep me</i>

40:19.200 --> 40:21.680
in the factory
for my working life, basically.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.720
And I was chatting to the old guys there,
that had done 40 years

40:24.760 --> 40:26.760
and I was like,
"I don't want that to be me."

40:26.840 --> 40:28.840
<i>I got the opportunity</i>
<i>to go out to America</i>

40:28.960 --> 40:30.560
<i>and play football at Hammerheads.</i>

40:30.600 --> 40:33.480
Coming of age, 18.
And going into the men's game,

40:33.600 --> 40:35.880
it gave me an opportunity
to play football every day,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.120
which I couldn't get in England
at the time.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.320
<i>Looking back now,</i>
<i>it was a big move for my career.</i>

40:40.440 --> 40:44.520
A steady rise, I suppose,
from, like, Unibond first,

40:44.640 --> 40:47.960
Unibond Premier
into the Conference North,

40:48.080 --> 40:49.760
Conference League Two, League One

40:49.880 --> 40:52.920
<i>and then I joined Brighton in League One.</i>
<i>I spent 3.5 years here.</i>

40:53.000 --> 40:55.120
<i>And we never came across Palace</i>
<i>in the league.</i>

40:55.160 --> 40:56.400
<i>Not coming up against them,</i>

40:56.520 --> 40:59.520
<i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>to the extent of the rivalry.</i>

40:59.560 --> 41:01.840
<i>It was a shame really</i>
<i>because they've gone into the Amex,</i>

41:01.960 --> 41:03.160
<i>they've momentum behind them.</i>

41:03.200 --> 41:06.760
<i>But at that point, it just wasn't for me</i>
<i>and it was time for pastures new.</i>

41:06.800 --> 41:10.520
Dougie kept going on and on at me
about this guy at Brighton, Glenn Murray.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.640
"He's just scored 30 goals
for Brighton, Dougie.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.080
Got them promoted. How can we get him?"
He said, "No, no, I really think we can."

41:16.160 --> 41:20.840
I didn't really want to relocate.
I was happy with a Brighton girl.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.480
Ended up looking for clubs in-around

41:23.520 --> 41:27.120
and, yeah,
Palace was appealing at the time.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.640
I can remember Dougie, we met,

41:29.720 --> 41:32.600
<i>he came to Dagenham & Redbridge</i>
<i>versus Brighton.</i>

41:32.680 --> 41:35.920
I can remember him telling me
how bad I'd been in the game.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.680
<i>But then I just popped up with a goal</i>
<i>and he was like,</i>

41:38.760 --> 41:40.720
<i>"That's what I want. That's what I need."</i>

41:40.800 --> 41:44.200
And promised me that I'd score goals
and that sounded like music to my ears.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.680
And he was a lower league player
at the time, I told him that.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.120
But I told him if he comes to a stage

41:48.200 --> 41:50.200
where the expectations
are a little bit higher

41:50.280 --> 41:52.440
<i>and the challenge is gonna be promotion,</i>

41:52.520 --> 41:53.960
<i>then I think you'll up your game.</i>

41:54.040 --> 41:57.080
So that sort of intrigued him
half way through the summer.

41:57.160 --> 42:00.560
I was like, "Yeah, let's do it."
Yeah, it didn't go down too well.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.720
All I can say is that I gave 100%
for both clubs,

42:02.800 --> 42:04.640
and I enjoyed my time at both clubs.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.880
I don't think there was
a huge plan there.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.040
I think it was just probably just
to stabilize the club more than anything.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.760
<i>There was a couple of moments,</i>
<i>I started off quite well.</i>

42:13.840 --> 42:15.920
Took me a while to really find my feet.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.200
These three particular players
didn't hit the ground running.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.480
It took time that first year.
There were moments...

42:20.560 --> 42:23.400
<i>We beat Man United in the league cup,</i>
<i>but we started to wane.</i>

42:24.120 --> 42:29.200
<i>Not a bad effort!</i>
<i>What a goal by Darren Ambrose!</i>

42:29.280 --> 42:32.120
<i>Absolutely stunning strike!</i>

42:32.200 --> 42:35.760
<i>When you have a massive high,</i>
<i>very difficult to replicate that.</i>

42:35.840 --> 42:37.680
<i>It was bit of an anti-climax</i>

42:37.760 --> 42:39.960
<i>after we went out to Cardiff</i>
<i>in the semi-final.</i>

42:40.040 --> 42:43.080
<i>We fell away quite badly</i>
<i>and we had many draws</i>

42:43.160 --> 42:45.520
and it was a bit uninspiring football.

42:45.600 --> 42:50.080
We stayed up, slightly more comfortably
than we had done before.

42:50.160 --> 42:51.720
<i>So, yes, we were still</i>
<i>a championship team.</i>

42:51.800 --> 42:53.440
We were building to something that season,

42:53.520 --> 42:56.120
<i>but it wasn't ultimately</i>
<i>what everyone wanted.</i>

42:56.200 --> 42:59.880
That season just wasn't one
that I look back on with any fondness.

43:06.640 --> 43:11.680
I'd promised the three investor partners
that I would run the club sustainably.

43:11.760 --> 43:16.120
I learned pretty quickly that that would
involve selling players at some point.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.440
<i>The guys were trying to put</i>
<i>the club in a good shape, financially.</i>

43:19.520 --> 43:20.920
<i>And I was trying to get promotion.</i>

43:21.000 --> 43:23.040
<i>But I was deliberately difficult</i>
<i>as a consequence.</i>

43:23.120 --> 43:25.440
Building a squad to stay in the division
is one thing.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.960
Trying to build a squad
to get promoted is completely different.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.440
<i>We lost Darren Ambrose,</i>
<i>we lost Sean Scannell.</i>

43:32.520 --> 43:36.440
We knew we weren't gonna create a team
that would pass everybody to death.

43:36.520 --> 43:40.160
We had to sacrifice
some players of talent like Darren

43:40.240 --> 43:42.440
in order to create the income,

43:42.520 --> 43:45.000
to create the kind of team
that Dougie wanted,

43:45.080 --> 43:46.960
that Dougie believed
could get us promoted,

43:47.040 --> 43:50.320
which was, you know, gonna be based
around being solid and difficult to beat.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.800
<i>I felt that we needed</i>
<i>a little bit more energy</i>

43:52.880 --> 43:55.520
<i>at full-back positions,</i>
<i>and I felt we needed</i>

43:55.600 --> 43:58.000
a very creative midfield player
and a wide man.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.960
To identify a player,
it should be simple in my rule.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.960
To actually to go and recruit them
is the hard part.

44:04.040 --> 44:07.040
And there was times we'd meet
in the middle when we'd sign good players.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.240
And we worked together
and one by one

44:09.320 --> 44:12.760
you could start to feel
that something was taking shape.

44:26.600 --> 44:28.920
<i>First and foremost,</i>
<i>we're south of the river Tyne here,</i>

44:29.000 --> 44:30.800
<i>so I have come</i>
<i>into enemy territory here.</i>

44:30.880 --> 44:33.480
<i>This is Gateshead. Newcastle's the other</i>
<i>side of the Tyne Bridge there,</i>

44:33.560 --> 44:35.760
<i>but, no, this is where I grew up.</i>

44:35.840 --> 44:37.880
<i>I class myself as a Geordie.</i>

44:37.960 --> 44:40.200
Whilst I was born and bred in Berwick.
I am a Geordie,

44:40.280 --> 44:42.520
which is this beautiful part of the world.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.880
I was 11 when I started in the academy.

44:44.960 --> 44:48.080
<i>So I came through under Bobby Robson.</i>
<i>Right-back on the Saturday,</i>

44:48.160 --> 44:50.840
centre-back on the Wednesday
and left-back on the following weekend.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.440
<i>I was somewhat of a polyfilla</i>
<i>first couple of years</i>

44:53.520 --> 44:56.520
before I really established myself
which followed me throughout my career.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.560
Just after the second half,
I landed awkwardly and tore my cruciate

44:59.640 --> 45:03.320
<i>and Kevin Keegan came in,</i>
<i>who was another idol of mine growing up</i>

45:03.400 --> 45:06.520
and yeah, I was gonna fight for my place
but probably wasn't gonna play.

45:06.600 --> 45:10.120
<i>It was heart breaking as a young kid,</i>
<i>especially hearing it from your idol.</i>

45:10.200 --> 45:13.280
When you leave
and leave to go to somewhere like London,

45:13.360 --> 45:16.720
it really does hit home
just how small Newcastle is

45:16.800 --> 45:20.360
<i>compared to the big concrete jungle</i>
<i>that is London. I loved it though.</i>

45:20.440 --> 45:22.440
I struggled the first six months

45:22.520 --> 45:25.120
<i>but a mutual friend of ours,</i>
<i>big Damien Delaney,</i>

45:25.200 --> 45:27.440
<i>grasped me by the scruff of my neck</i>
<i>and pulled me around</i>

45:27.520 --> 45:29.240
<i>to become an adopted Cockney.</i>

45:29.920 --> 45:30.960
<i>What a guy!</i>

45:31.040 --> 45:34.360
Rambo would give you the shirt
off his back in a snowstorm.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.200
That's got to be
the best compliment I could give him.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.840
He'd do anything for anyone.

45:37.920 --> 45:40.880
<i>Genuinely the most helpful,</i>
<i>selfless player</i>

45:40.960 --> 45:43.840
<i>I've come across to be honest with you.</i>
<i>And that's how he played football.</i>

45:46.080 --> 45:48.640
<i>I mean, you always hope and dream that</i>
<i>you're gonna play at the highest level.</i>

45:48.720 --> 45:51.240
The older I got, I thought I got better
at reading the game.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.000
Other people might tell you differently,
but I always thought I was half-decent.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.760
Yeah. He is. He was brilliant.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.600
<i>He was what I needed</i>
<i>at that moment in time.</i>

46:01.680 --> 46:05.160
He just reassured me I was gonna play.
Pretty good coach as well.

46:05.240 --> 46:10.040
But good people. And you know
Dougie's been a real role model for me.

46:10.120 --> 46:12.480
<i>Neil came in,</i>
<i>but he let it be known to me</i>

46:12.560 --> 46:15.040
<i>that I wasn't gonna be part</i>
<i>of the 25-man squad in the Premier League</i>

46:15.120 --> 46:17.920
and I wasn't expecting to,
but he wanted me to go out on loan.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.880
Get yourself in the car,
get around the M25

46:19.960 --> 46:21.920
and you're gonna meet Dougie
at the Croydon Park Hotel.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.680
And that was it, I was there on loan.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.760
<i>It was the building of something</i>
<i>which I thought,</i>

46:26.840 --> 46:29.320
<i>you know, would be good to be part of.</i>
<i>Dougie wanted to keep me.</i>

46:29.400 --> 46:30.560
<i>I wanted to stay.</i>

46:30.880 --> 46:34.600
Neil came and went.
Mark Hughes was then manager at QPR.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.320
<i>And I might have another opportunity</i>
<i>to win a place</i>

46:37.400 --> 46:39.160
<i>within the 25-man squad</i>
<i>in the Premier League.</i>

46:39.240 --> 46:41.560
<i>At the end of the January,</i>
<i>they named the 25 and I wasn't in it.</i>

46:41.640 --> 46:44.440
Maybe I wasn't good enough,
big enough and ugly enough to accept.

46:44.520 --> 46:47.640
Midway through pre-season,
I didn't really have anything.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.080
And Dougie just rang me up
out of the blue and said,

46:49.160 --> 46:50.840
"Listen, what're you doing?"

46:50.920 --> 46:54.160
I was like, "Well, sitting on
the River Tyne, just having a pint."

46:54.240 --> 46:56.800
He said, "Right, get in the car.
You're coming down." I'll say it and it's,

46:56.880 --> 46:58.640
you know, it's the age old thing,
money wasn't an issue.

46:58.720 --> 47:01.800
it was just about being in an environment
where I felt that I was gonna be wanted.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.280
And playing for a manager
who I felt wanted me.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.680
And that's what I felt with Dougie.
That was when I just thought

47:06.760 --> 47:09.440
this was the right place for me
and didn't hesitate in signing.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.800
With Joel Ward,
he thought he was a number ten.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.800
And I called and told him he's only gonna
be a full-back in the premiership.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.280
Do you want
a bedtime story or something? Nah.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.920
Started for Portsmouth,
went on loan to Bournemouth.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.600
The year they started on minus 17,

47:27.680 --> 47:31.320
we stayed in football league that year
which was a heck of an achievement.

47:31.400 --> 47:34.360
<i>Then I went back to Portsmouth</i>
<i>and that's where I made my debut.</i>

47:34.440 --> 47:37.080
Two seasons playing
pretty much every game.

47:37.160 --> 47:42.240
2012 came, I'd gone up to sign for Leeds.
Everything was kind of ready to go.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.240
<i>And they were saying couple of weeks</i>

47:44.320 --> 47:47.200
<i>and then we'll get it all sorted.</i>
<i>And I said, "Well, if you're saying that,</i>

47:47.280 --> 47:49.800
<i>then I'm gonna sign for Palace</i>
<i>on the Monday."</i>

47:49.880 --> 47:53.240
I played with Joel and roomed with Joel
while we were at Bournemouth.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.240
In fact, I can remember
being on a holiday,

47:55.320 --> 47:58.720
Dougie rang me on holiday saying,
"You know, can you speak to Joel?"

47:58.800 --> 48:02.360
Talk about the club, talk about...
Try and sell the club to him basically.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.760
<i>I remember saying to the chairman...</i>
<i>was keeping hold of Wilf.</i>

48:04.840 --> 48:07.240
<i>Whenever I see him now,</i>
<i>we still talk about it,</i>

48:07.320 --> 48:11.160
<i>we kind of reminisce the old times</i>
<i>that we thankfully did. Rest is history.</i>

48:37.800 --> 48:41.120
<i>Start of the season,</i>
<i>we were second favourites for relegation.</i>

48:41.200 --> 48:44.160
<i>150 to 1 to get the promotion.</i>

48:44.200 --> 48:46.520
<i>If we stay up,</i>
<i>that won't be too bad.</i>

48:47.120 --> 48:49.000
<i>We didn't get off to the best starts.</i>

48:49.560 --> 48:50.960
<i>And Watford lead.</i>

48:52.440 --> 48:56.800
<i>Vydra drives it. It's another of those</i>
<i>Udinese loanees who's got it.</i>

48:56.880 --> 48:58.640
<i>It's a dreadful first touch in the end</i>

48:58.680 --> 49:02.080
<i>by Moxey and an opportunity here.</i>
<i>He's through on goal</i>

49:02.160 --> 49:04.440
<i>and that is absolutely disastrous!</i>

49:04.520 --> 49:06.960
<i>Terrible defending by Crystal Palace.</i>

49:07.040 --> 49:09.800
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>last season we finished really badly.</i>

49:09.880 --> 49:11.600
<i>So it wasn't looking very good.</i>

49:11.680 --> 49:14.920
<i>He was obviously</i>
<i>under a bit of pressure, Dougie.</i>

49:15.000 --> 49:16.560
<i>And that is hard when you've got</i>
<i>a young manager</i>

49:16.640 --> 49:19.000
<i>who's never done it anywhere else.</i>
<i>It's hard.</i>

49:25.240 --> 49:28.760
There was tension in that summer.

49:28.840 --> 49:34.000
And probably I said "no" too much,
and that became apparent

49:34.080 --> 49:35.960
in the first couple of games
of the season.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.320
There was a moment in the summer

49:38.960 --> 49:41.920
when Dougie wanted
another one or two players.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.600
There was a budget that had been set
and we'd spent it.

49:44.680 --> 49:47.720
Some sort of upsetting words were said
with the board throughout the summer.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.320
I was a little bit disappointed,
we had not recruited the players

49:50.360 --> 49:51.560
that I had identified.

49:51.640 --> 49:54.200
For whatever reasons, you know,
they weren't in the building yet.

49:54.280 --> 49:57.120
Because I'd just saw people in football
just spend and spend and spend

49:57.200 --> 50:00.520
in an unsustainable way and we had
been through two administrations.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.640
But probably in that summer
I stressed it too much

50:02.720 --> 50:04.360
<i>and we lost the first few games.</i>

50:04.440 --> 50:07.400
<i>And the misery continues</i>
<i>for Crystal Palace!</i>

50:07.480 --> 50:10.120
<i>It felt bad.</i>
<i>Off the back of the season before,</i>

50:10.200 --> 50:13.000
<i>bottom of the table, it felt bad.</i>

50:15.880 --> 50:18.800
And I was in the carpark after the game

50:18.880 --> 50:22.040
and Bright was there
and Neil Ashton was there,

50:22.120 --> 50:23.720
people I knew cared about the club.

50:23.800 --> 50:26.600
And I think we thought, "You know,
is this all going wrong

50:26.680 --> 50:29.840
or should we stick to it
and support Dougie?"

50:29.920 --> 50:32.920
Just congregating in the carpark
and we just stood there and discussed.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.680
Wasn't going well.
Yeah, Steve just asked some questions.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.480
<i>It was just such a pivotal moment.</i>
<i>It was one of those moments</i>

50:39.560 --> 50:41.440
<i>where the fans were talking</i>
<i>about Dougie's record</i>

50:41.520 --> 50:44.960
from the end of last season to this
and how few games we'd won.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.400
I drove back down to London with Mark.

50:47.480 --> 50:50.240
My feelings were that, you know,
to give him a bit more time,

50:50.320 --> 50:51.600
give him a chance.

50:51.680 --> 50:54.440
You know, he's a legend,
he's a hero here, so...

50:54.520 --> 50:56.640
You're not happy,
then things have to change.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.800
If results aren't good enough, then,
you know, you have to change the manager.

50:59.880 --> 51:03.000
<i>Mark was very much, "Look, I like</i>
<i>a lot of the things I'm seeing.</i>

51:03.080 --> 51:04.240
There are holes in the squad."

51:04.320 --> 51:07.960
After the Bristol City game,
there was rumours,

51:08.040 --> 51:11.960
there was talks in carparks
and, you know, discussions were made.

51:12.040 --> 51:16.560
And I didn't like that 'cause I felt
that I had a strong enough relationship

51:16.640 --> 51:18.200
you know, with the board,
in particular Steve,

51:18.280 --> 51:20.720
and if he had anything to say,
you gotta say it to myself.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.360
And subsequently,
I arranged to have a meeting

51:24.240 --> 51:26.120
with Dougie to go over it all.

51:26.200 --> 51:28.040
And it was a very pivotal meeting,

51:28.120 --> 51:30.440
we had to address where we were right now.

51:30.520 --> 51:34.680
And that wasn't the position that
we were looking up rather than down.

51:34.760 --> 51:38.640
Sacking managers, finding new managers,
all the upheaval,

51:38.720 --> 51:41.560
it's not what you want,
but Dougie was in trouble.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.480
You know, the results weren't great.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.280
He was complaining
about KG playing on the wing,

51:46.360 --> 51:47.840
which was fair enough.

51:47.920 --> 51:53.040
And I was very frank and very honest.
And Steve pulled no punches, you know.

51:53.120 --> 51:57.360
If he was to get the financial backing,
what he then expected from me.

51:57.440 --> 51:58.880
It was quite difficult.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.800
And I was questioning my time.

52:00.880 --> 52:04.000
You know, I was thinking,
"Is it time for me to step down?"

52:04.080 --> 52:06.080
which would have been
a huge disappointment to me.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.880
And not recruiting what I felt was
what we needed to get promotion,

52:08.960 --> 52:10.280
that was always at the back of my head.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.320
You know, if we can
get one or two players

52:12.400 --> 52:15.120
and we can get promotion,
I knew what I had.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.920
Everybody wants to make it work

52:17.000 --> 52:18.440
with what's there at the moment.

52:19.040 --> 52:21.320
It was really a stick or twist moment.

52:21.400 --> 52:24.240
Do you sack the manager?

52:24.320 --> 52:25.880
Or do you back the manager?

52:40.840 --> 52:42.520
<i>Simply sensational!</i>

52:43.200 --> 52:44.600
<i>Relief for Palace.</i>

52:45.640 --> 52:48.000
<i>What a goal! Wilfried Zaha!</i>

52:49.480 --> 52:51.480
<i>Simply magical!</i>
