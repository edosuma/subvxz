WEBVTT

00:32.520 --> 00:38.510
THE HIGH SUN

01:19.510 --> 01:21.500
Why did you stop ?

01:22.500 --> 01:23.500
That was enough.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.500
Go on, play.

01:26.510 --> 01:28.500
- Go on.
- No.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.500
- What do you mean, no ?
- Pay me.

01:30.510 --> 01:33.510
Stop kicking me,
I'll throw you into the sea.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.510
You won't play ?

01:49.520 --> 01:51.500
Will you play ?

01:52.510 --> 01:54.510
How about now ?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.520
- Someone will see you, you crazy ?
- There's no one.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.500
Go on.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.510
- Will you play ?
- You're totally crazy !

02:07.510 --> 02:08.520
You're tickling me !

02:10.500 --> 02:11.510
Let me go !

02:22.510 --> 02:24.510
I can't believe we're going.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.500
You can't, huh ?

02:27.500 --> 02:30.500
- What did I tell you ?
- What did I tell you ?

02:31.510 --> 02:33.500
What did I tell you ?

03:07.510 --> 03:09.500
Let's go swimming.

03:09.510 --> 03:11.510
- That's for little girls.
- Come on...

03:12.500 --> 03:13.520
I'll roll one with Božo.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.510
Look how beautiful it is.

03:17.510 --> 03:18.510
Come, let's go !

03:20.500 --> 03:21.500
You lazy ass.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.510
Lazy ass !

03:39.520 --> 03:43.500
- Making out, eh ?
- Guilty as charged... One has to.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Just keep on doing it.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.510
Traitors.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.500
What ?

03:51.500 --> 03:55.500
- Do it where you plan to elope.
- We will, don't you worry.

03:55.510 --> 03:57.510
- You arranged everything ?
- I have.

03:57.510 --> 04:00.500
- Waiting tables from Friday on.
- You ?!

04:00.500 --> 04:01.510
Sure.

04:01.510 --> 04:03.510
Screw the café that takes you.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.500
- Like you're gonna teach me ?
- My life's too short for that.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.510
A born head waiter you are...

04:08.510 --> 04:11.520
- I plan to play a bit too.
- Better stick to waiting.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.510
Less damage that way.

04:16.510 --> 04:17.520
When are we leaving ?

04:18.500 --> 04:21.520
- Tomorrow, after the gig.
- I'll be waiting on the side.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.520
You're a real...

04:36.510 --> 04:38.500
Why not take me too ?

04:39.500 --> 04:40.520
I can be your ace in the hole.

04:41.510 --> 04:44.500
We're not emigrating,
it's just Zagreb !

04:44.500 --> 04:47.500
What am I gonna do here,
smoke with the sheep ?

04:47.510 --> 04:50.500
- I'll send for you, relax.
- You'd better.

04:51.510 --> 04:52.510
Damn...

04:56.520 --> 04:58.510
It's kind of beautiful.

04:59.510 --> 05:02.520
You will see,
you're gonna miss it.

05:08.510 --> 05:10.500
Screw a summer like this.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.510
Take it easy, Božo.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.500
Fuckers...

06:07.510 --> 06:10.520
JELENA AND IVAN, 1991

06:18.510 --> 06:20.520
Gotta go,
my folks will kill me.

07:25.510 --> 07:28.520
- Hey, kid, come drink with us.
- Let's grab a beer.

07:45.510 --> 07:47.510
- Where have you been ?
- At the beach.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.510
- All this time ?
- Mom...

08:05.500 --> 08:07.510
Well, what's going on
down there ?

08:10.510 --> 08:11.510
Nothing.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
Stop it.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.500
- Stop doing that now !
- Saša !

08:39.510 --> 08:41.510
What did I say ?
Not to go down there !

08:41.510 --> 08:42.510
Get off of me !

08:42.520 --> 08:45.500
- Want to die before your time ?!
- What do you care ?!

08:45.510 --> 08:47.510
- Stop it you two !
- You cork it !

08:51.510 --> 08:54.510
Can't you see what's been cooking ?
You dumb fool.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.500
All because the likes of you.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.500
The likes of me...

09:14.520 --> 09:16.510
You fucking...
Damn you !

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
Leave her !

09:19.500 --> 09:21.510
She's fucking
that oaf from their side !

09:21.520 --> 09:23.520
I'm the laughing stock
of the village.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.500
- Get away from me !
- Stop it, you two !

09:34.510 --> 09:37.520
You'd both get yours
if only Dad were alive !

09:37.520 --> 09:40.510
- Jelena ! Go to your room !
- Mom !

09:40.510 --> 09:43.500
- Go to your room !
- Listen to your mother !

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
Go on, eat.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.510
Have you seen him ?
No ?

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
Have you seen him ?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.510
Where are you off to, granny ?

10:36.500 --> 10:37.510
Oh, fuck...

10:40.510 --> 10:43.500
- It's show time, folks !
- Shut up, you...

10:44.510 --> 10:46.520
- Where have you been ?
- Why are you outside ?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.520
You didn't come to school yesterday.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.510
- I was alone in the bench.
- Pipe it down a bit, huh ?

10:51.510 --> 10:53.520
They're recruiting
all the young ones.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.500
- Got scared they'd drafted you.
- You can see they didn't.

10:57.510 --> 11:01.500
They say, Hitler is moving his army
again. There may be another war.

11:01.510 --> 11:03.520
- What do you mean Hitler ?!
- He sure is !

11:04.500 --> 11:06.520
- Evil is here !
- Listen to your granny, Ivan.

11:07.510 --> 11:10.500
- She's way more wiser than you.
- You keep out of it.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.500
I was alone at school. It's different
than when you're with me.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.520
Do tell him, granny.
He got too close to that lot yonder.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
Mane !
Cool it !

11:22.500 --> 11:24.520
- Will you stop it ?
- You want me to stop ?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.500
They're blocking roads,
planting mines

11:27.510 --> 11:29.510
while you're fucking
in their houses.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
Let it go.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.520
Let's go home, Granny.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.520
What, am I wrong ?

11:54.500 --> 11:57.500
If those devils come,
you run for the mountains.

11:57.510 --> 12:00.510
- No one's coming, Granny.
- They are. Hush you.

12:00.510 --> 12:04.510
You just take it to the mountains
and go as deep as you can.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.500
And I'll find you there.

12:07.510 --> 12:10.520
Them devils won't stop us
from dancing.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
And don't you worry,

12:12.510 --> 12:16.510
I won't let anyone sit
in the bench with me at school.

12:16.510 --> 12:19.500
- I'll keep it for you.
- Way to go, Granny.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.500
Mother asked me
about us today.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.510
I told her nothing !

12:28.500 --> 12:29.520
Sleep now, Granny.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.500
Be very careful, Ivan.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.510
Promise Granny you will be.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.500
- I promise, Granny.
- Good...

12:56.500 --> 12:57.510
Sleep now.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.500
This too...

13:08.510 --> 13:10.510
Saša will go nuts
when he finds out.

13:10.510 --> 13:13.520
- We will be in the city by then.
- Don't be mad with him, he's lost.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
Who asked that from him ? You ?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
- No.
- I know you didn't.

13:18.510 --> 13:19.520
He got drafted.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.510
Him in the army.
Damn, he's always hated it.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.500
They're drafting everybody,
why avoid him ? He has to.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.510
You don't have to do anything.
Jut like I don't have to stay here.

13:33.510 --> 13:36.520
- Don't be mad at him.
- I'm not.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.510
- I'm sorry for him.
- Talk too him. He's your brother.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.500
- Take that jacket.
- It's summer, Mom.

13:49.510 --> 13:50.520
That means nothing.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.510
This is clean.

13:58.510 --> 14:00.510
Couldn't you make it thinner ?

14:08.510 --> 14:10.500
So you've decided, right ?

14:11.510 --> 14:13.500
I called Aunty, too.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
Did she disapprove ?

14:18.500 --> 14:21.500
Disapprove ?
She invited me in the first place.

14:21.510 --> 14:25.500
I'll be giving her money,
Jelena will find a job.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
I swear, this isn't
lacking salt either.

14:50.520 --> 14:55.510
Do you know what I promised
your mother on her death bed ?

14:56.500 --> 14:59.510
I promised her I'd be looking
after you and Granny.

15:00.510 --> 15:02.500
Yes, I know.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.520
- So very nice of you.
- Nice my ass.

15:05.510 --> 15:08.520
Who could look after you ?
You're leaving with that girl,

15:08.520 --> 15:11.510
Granny's getting nuttier
with every day

15:12.500 --> 15:15.510
and I can't tie up
all the loose ends.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.500
Yeah, you just laugh.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.520
If your late mother knew
you're tied up with one of theirs,

15:21.520 --> 15:23.510
she'd be turning in her grave.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.500
She'd be happy !

15:25.500 --> 15:27.520
Can't you see what's been
going on, you oaf ?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.510
That's why we're running away.
To be left alone.

15:30.510 --> 15:32.500
Yeah, and fuck me !

15:33.500 --> 15:36.500
- Not for long, till it calms down.
- It will my ass !

15:36.500 --> 15:38.500
Everybody's gone crazy !

15:56.500 --> 15:57.510
Do you need money ?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.500
It wouldn't do any harm
for the first day.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.510
Dad, hey... don't worry.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.500
I'll be back soon, Mom.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
Homemade wine.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.510
- Hey ! Ready ?
- I sure am.

20:22.510 --> 20:24.500
- How about a beer ?
- Give me one.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.510
Listen...

20:26.510 --> 20:29.520
You could put in a good word
for me to the girls in the city.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.510
Oh, I'll tell them the best fuck
on earth lives here.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.520
I keep saying you're a clever one.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.500
- I'm gonna miss this.
- Miss me ?

20:39.510 --> 20:42.520
- You fool ! This, here.
- You can still change your mind.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.500
- It's going to be great in the city.
- Of course.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.520
- OK, I'm gonna miss you too a bit.
- You little pig, you.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.510
You oaf.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.510
Will you look at that moron...

20:55.510 --> 20:57.510
- Why ?
- Look for yourself.

20:59.510 --> 21:02.510
Don't tell anyone in the city
he's your boyfriend.

23:17.510 --> 23:19.500
Hey, leave her alone !

23:27.510 --> 23:29.500
Ivan, stop ! Ivan !

23:30.500 --> 23:31.510
- I won't go back !
- Yes, you are !

23:31.520 --> 23:33.500
Dad would be ashamed of you !

23:35.510 --> 23:36.520
Stop fucking around !

24:59.500 --> 25:00.510
Jelena !

25:01.510 --> 25:02.510
Jelena !

25:02.520 --> 25:04.500
Hey, Jele...

25:12.500 --> 25:13.500
Get up.

25:14.510 --> 25:15.510
Get up !

25:48.500 --> 25:49.500
Get out !

25:52.500 --> 25:53.500
Get out !

26:10.500 --> 26:13.510
Three minutes after we came into
the house, she was done. Lied down...

26:13.520 --> 26:15.500
You understand...

26:16.510 --> 26:17.510
Look at that fool.

26:19.510 --> 26:21.510
- Who's that ?
- A lunatic.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.500
Whoa, dear friend.

26:28.510 --> 26:30.520
- I have to pass through.
- You only have to die.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.510
You won't pass here.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.500
My girlfriend passed through here.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.500
Beat it.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.500
Let me through, dammit !

26:43.500 --> 26:45.510
Did you hear what I said ?
Beat it.

26:47.510 --> 26:49.500
Beat it, motherfucker.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.500
Scram !

27:30.520 --> 27:33.500
Let me go,
I've had enough !

27:33.500 --> 27:35.510
Calm down.
Hold her.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.500
I'll settle this.

27:48.510 --> 27:49.510
Go.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.500
Go on.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.520
Drive !

28:31.500 --> 28:32.510
A free concert.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.510
The fool won't stop playing.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
Get lost !

28:39.520 --> 28:41.510
Get lost, I'm telling you !

28:41.520 --> 28:43.510
Be a man and let her go !

28:45.500 --> 28:46.520
Scram ! Go home !

28:49.500 --> 28:50.510
Please go home.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.520
Fucking go !

28:57.500 --> 28:58.500
To your own kind !

29:01.520 --> 29:03.500
Fucking...

29:24.510 --> 29:27.500
Fucking fool !
Killed a man for no reason !

29:27.500 --> 29:29.510
- Ivan !
- No ! No !

29:29.510 --> 29:31.510
Let me go !

29:31.520 --> 29:34.500
Fuck off !

29:37.500 --> 29:38.510
Let me go !

29:47.500 --> 29:48.500
Ivan...

33:09.520 --> 33:12.510
NATAŠA AND ANTE, 2001

33:38.520 --> 33:41.500
- Motherfuckers.
- Stop swearing.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.500
What ? Bastards did this for kicks.

34:27.510 --> 34:29.510
Will you stop crying ?

34:36.500 --> 34:39.520
- What the hell got into you ?
- Dražen wouldn't want you to cry.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.510
- Why are you so cold ?
- I'm not.

34:42.510 --> 34:46.500
- He wouldn't like you lamenting.
- You are, Nata.

34:46.510 --> 34:50.500
Why do you think I'm here ?
Why do you think I came with you ?

34:50.510 --> 34:52.510
- Where else would you go ?
- I'd have managed.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.500
- Where else would you go ?
- Someplace abroad, dammit.

34:57.510 --> 34:58.510
Don't talk rubbish.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.520
We'll refurbish this.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.510
Why that look ?

35:20.500 --> 35:22.500
Everything's better
than where we were.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.500
It is.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.510
And quit telling me I'm cold.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.510
- Maybe we shouldn't have called.
- There she goes again...

37:04.510 --> 37:06.500
'Cause of Dražen.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.500
If he were alive, this would be
fixed in a month.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.520
Don't want one of them to mess
around here. I'm cancelling it.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.520
- What's the matter with you ?
- I don't know.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.520
Can't you see we
can't do it ourselves ?

37:18.500 --> 37:20.500
Someone else needs to fix it.

37:20.510 --> 37:22.500
Go on, from above.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.510
Go on.
Open the gate.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.500
Go on, there's no turning back.

37:34.510 --> 37:36.500
Do you hear ?
Go on.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.510
Hello.
Did you call ?

37:56.510 --> 37:57.520
Yeah. Inside !

38:16.510 --> 38:19.510
You were right.
There's a lot to do here.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.500
It will take time.

38:30.510 --> 38:33.500
- But it can be done.
- When can you start ?

38:33.510 --> 38:35.510
- Well, here...
- Then start.

38:37.500 --> 38:38.520
- Hello.
- Hello.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
- Ante, pleased to meet you.
- Zorka.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.510
- Where are you off to ?
- Dražen's grave.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.520
- Shall I start ?
- Sure thing.

39:50.500 --> 39:54.500
He also fixed the entrance
and I was paying in installments.

39:54.500 --> 39:58.520
Then he asked additional money
for the material. And I paid.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.510
And I never saw him
or the money again.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.510
And you won't,
the likes of him never come back.

40:04.510 --> 40:08.500
They'd trick their own mother.
That's repairmen for you.

40:08.510 --> 40:12.520
Don't talk like that, Ante.
You're one of them too.

40:12.520 --> 40:16.500
- Sure, but I'm not like that.
- I can see that, yeah.

40:16.510 --> 40:19.510
- So have you got enough work ?
- Not much.

40:20.500 --> 40:23.500
We're almost done
with the inn on the shore.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.500
- Do you remember it ?
- Of course I do.

40:27.520 --> 40:32.500
We knocked off
a good month of work.

40:32.510 --> 40:33.510
But it's OK.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.520
- Let people have fun.
- Sure.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.510
- People started to swim down there ?
- Yeah...

40:40.510 --> 40:43.510
More and more.
Lots of kiddies.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.500
I hanged down there as a kid
day and night.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.500
Not only as a kid,
when I was young too.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.510
Sneakers on,
high heeled shoes in my bag,

40:52.520 --> 40:55.520
put them on
and I'd sway away like...

40:56.510 --> 40:57.510
Dancing, right.

40:57.510 --> 41:00.500
- We'd call it swaying.
- Dancing, right.

41:00.510 --> 41:04.510
The best thing was finding
a shade at the sunset down there.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.500
Yes, yes...

41:10.500 --> 41:11.500
Excuse me...

41:27.510 --> 41:30.500
You should have invited him
for lunch.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
He hasn't stopped since morning.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.510
Eats only sandwiches.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.500
Forget it.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.500
- Hello.
- Hey, Ante.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.500
How you doin' ?

42:38.500 --> 42:40.520
- Gettin' along.
- Right. Way to go.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.500
I could use a hand today.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.510
Holding stuff and such.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.520
Nataša's here,
so whatever you need.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.510
Terrific. Thanks.

42:57.500 --> 43:00.500
Got a thousand things on my mind.
I have to go shopping.

43:26.510 --> 43:28.500
See you. Be good.

45:16.500 --> 45:17.520
I'm sorry.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
Can you give me a hand
over here ?

45:35.510 --> 45:37.520
Just hand me those boards.

46:43.510 --> 46:46.500
- Need anything else ?
- Not now, thanks.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.500
Look what I bought for you.

46:58.510 --> 47:00.500
Where are you off to ?

47:52.510 --> 47:54.510
So you quit school ?

47:54.510 --> 47:57.510
Someone has to work.
And look after my mom.

47:57.510 --> 47:59.510
Come on, it's getting cold.

48:04.500 --> 48:06.510
Ante sealed the window for us.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
There will be no draft anymore.

48:12.510 --> 48:14.520
- Where were we ?
- My mom.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.510
It's a long time
since Dad got killed.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.510
She can't get rid of
the damned pills.

48:21.510 --> 48:24.510
And you've taken it all
upon yourself.

48:24.510 --> 48:27.520
- I manage.
- I know, it's hard.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.510
When I started refurbishing
three months ago,

48:30.510 --> 48:34.510
I wanted to sort out the papers,
so I went to the land-registry.

48:34.520 --> 48:39.500
I came, and not a soul around.
What are their working hours ?

48:39.500 --> 48:41.510
In the mornings,
if they have time.

48:41.510 --> 48:44.500
You put it well,
that's how it is.

48:52.500 --> 48:55.500
How come you decided
to come back ?

48:55.510 --> 49:00.500
There was no life for us
where we were. But what can you do...

49:00.520 --> 49:04.520
This way we're on our own land.
Whatever life brings.

49:05.500 --> 49:08.510
You are going to enjoy it here.
Once this is done...

49:13.510 --> 49:16.500
And the girls ?
Have any ?

49:16.520 --> 49:18.510
There aren't many women here.

49:40.510 --> 49:41.520
Thank you very much.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
- See you.
- Bye.

49:59.520 --> 50:02.500
What the hell is wrong with you ?
Do you hear ?!

50:02.520 --> 50:08.500
The man is OK, he's working here,
and you behave like a lunatic !

50:08.500 --> 50:12.500
Any girl would chase him,
but you're so hard to deal with !

50:12.510 --> 50:16.500
The likes of him killed Dražen !
Everything's OK with him !

50:16.500 --> 50:19.510
You should be ashamed of yourself !
You cook for him. What's next ?!

50:19.510 --> 50:21.500
- Invite him overnight ?
- Hush !

50:21.500 --> 50:24.510
They killed your son down there,
and you're in cahoots with them !

50:25.500 --> 50:27.510
You ungrateful little swine.

50:28.500 --> 50:31.500
Is this why I slave and toil
day and night ?

50:31.510 --> 50:33.500
Is this how you thank me ?

50:39.510 --> 50:40.510
What am I ?!

50:42.520 --> 50:44.520
Is there a spot for me ?!

50:45.500 --> 50:49.500
Have you ever asked me,
"How are you ?!"

50:49.510 --> 50:52.510
"Are you OK ?!
Can you cope ?!"

50:57.500 --> 51:00.510
I'm not a mother.
I'm more like cattle !

51:15.520 --> 51:19.510
Pick up your stuff and leave...
wherever's better for you.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.500
I'm sorry.

52:30.500 --> 52:31.510
Good morning.

52:31.510 --> 52:33.500
Hey, Ante.

53:05.500 --> 53:06.510
Mom !

53:06.520 --> 53:08.500
It slipped.

53:09.510 --> 53:12.510
Let me look at it. You bring
some brandy. You sit down.

53:14.510 --> 53:16.500
Go on !
And a piece of cloth.

53:17.510 --> 53:19.520
- Is it deep ?
- Let me see.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.500
No, it's not.
It's gonna be OK.

53:24.510 --> 53:25.520
God damn...

53:27.500 --> 53:28.510
We'll take care of it now.

56:26.500 --> 56:27.510
Hey...

56:30.510 --> 56:32.510
- Good morning.
- Hey.

56:46.510 --> 56:48.500
Let me finish it.

56:49.500 --> 56:52.500
Lower the heat in five minutes
and add some black pepper.

57:53.500 --> 57:55.510
- You're really fast with it.
- Yeah.

57:57.520 --> 58:00.500
I thought it would take longer.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.520
Are you sure you won't eat ?

58:12.500 --> 58:13.510
I am.

58:20.510 --> 58:21.510
Too bad, it's good.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.510
- It's OK.
- Better than a sandwich.

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
Don't you have
anything better to do ?

58:44.520 --> 58:46.500
Watch over lunch.

59:01.500 --> 59:02.510
It might get burned.

59:51.500 --> 59:52.500
Hey.

59:55.500 --> 59:57.500
- Do you have time ?
- Why ?

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.510
Thought you might
take me to the shore.

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:10.510
To take a look at the inn.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:14.510
You want to see the inn ?

1:00:16.500 --> 1:00:18.510
I was hanging there as a kid, too.

1:00:21.500 --> 1:00:22.510
I should be going.

1:00:38.510 --> 1:00:40.500
Come.

1:00:57.510 --> 1:00:58.510
Where are you going ?

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:01.500
Going for a swim.

1:01:33.500 --> 1:01:34.510
You did a good job here.

1:01:35.510 --> 1:01:37.510
It wasn't just me, I had help.

1:01:38.510 --> 1:01:41.510
- It looks good.
- It's not bad.

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:52.510
Let's go for a swim.

1:01:53.510 --> 1:01:56.510
- Still have errands to run.
- Oh, come on.

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:08.510
I missed this.

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:13.500
This is the best time.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:18.500
Need a towel ?

1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:21.510
- Yours ?
- So what ?

1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:23.510
You shy or something ?

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:37.510
So there are really
no girls around ?

1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:42.520
Where would they be ?
Everyone fled to the city.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.510
A few of us guys have stayed,
and that's that.

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:49.500
Why don't you leave ?

1:03:51.510 --> 1:03:53.510
What would I do with my mom ?

1:03:54.510 --> 1:03:56.510
She needs to be looked after.

1:04:01.510 --> 1:04:04.500
Dražen would hang around here
all the time.

1:04:06.510 --> 1:04:08.500
Your brother ?

1:04:10.510 --> 1:04:12.510
He was never home.

1:04:12.510 --> 1:04:14.510
He'd fish and swim all the time.

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:18.500
He loved this.

1:04:19.510 --> 1:04:20.520
You miss him ?

1:04:23.510 --> 1:04:25.510
He taught me everything.

1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:28.510
How to dive...

1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:31.510
He was in charge of the music
all the time.

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:33.500
What kind did he like ?

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:41.500
They killed him like a dog.

1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:46.500
Was it my fault ?

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:56.500
Huh ?

1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:01.500
I asked you something.

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:09.500
Your people killed my dad.
But I'm not blaming you for it.

1:05:09.500 --> 1:05:11.510
- I didn't mean it like that.
- What did you mean ?

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:14.500
Does anyone ask me
what I think about it ?!

1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:17.510
Think I enjoy slaving every day ?

1:05:17.510 --> 1:05:20.520
Making sure my mom
won't take too many pills ?!

1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:24.520
No one cares what I think.

1:05:26.510 --> 1:05:27.510
Don't worry.

1:05:27.510 --> 1:05:30.520
I'm done tomorrow anyway,
so I won't bother you anymore.

1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:33.510
Pick up your stuff,
we're leaving.

1:06:35.510 --> 1:06:37.500
Why the dress-up ?

1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:39.520
I'm going to sort out the papers.

1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:45.500
- How will you go ?
- I'll catch a bus down there.

1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:49.500
I'll be back while Ante's still here.

1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:52.510
- He has to finish today anyway.
- I know.

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:56.500
I have to get the money for him.

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:00.510
See you.

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:31.520
So that's that.

1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:50.500
So that's that.

1:12:24.510 --> 1:12:26.510
Everything's settled.

1:12:29.510 --> 1:12:31.500
Do you hear me ?

1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:36.500
I settled it.

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:39.510
What happened ?

1:12:40.500 --> 1:12:41.510
Nothing.

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:44.510
Ante ?

1:12:55.510 --> 1:12:56.520
And this is for a beer.

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:08.510
What's up ?
Is there something wrong ?

1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:15.500
Everything's fine.
Don't worry.

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:17.510
Drop by for a cup of coffee
if you work nearby.

1:13:17.510 --> 1:13:19.500
I got a job in the city.

1:13:19.510 --> 1:13:22.510
At least three months worth.
I'll be there more than here.

1:13:22.510 --> 1:13:25.510
- OK, sit down and I'll make...
- I think Ante has to go.

1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:31.520
That's true.

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:52.500
You know, what ?
You just came back.

1:13:54.510 --> 1:13:56.510
You're gonna need this money.

1:13:58.500 --> 1:13:59.510
Please, don't.

1:14:00.510 --> 1:14:04.510
- You worked your butt off...
- Forget that, you'll need it.

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:09.510
What can I tell you ?

1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:12.510
Thank you.

1:14:16.510 --> 1:14:17.520
Everything's OK.

1:17:19.510 --> 1:17:21.500
Eh, that's it.

1:17:30.510 --> 1:17:32.510
I'm really fucking gullible.

1:17:32.510 --> 1:17:35.520
Cut the crap. One night.
We're leaving in the morning.

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:39.510
- Why not go directly to Split ?
- You don't have to go to them.

1:17:41.510 --> 1:17:44.520
Yeah, I'll go down there,
then hide like a fool.

1:17:45.510 --> 1:17:47.500
They'll be glad to see you.

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:51.510
Will I be glad ?

1:17:52.510 --> 1:17:54.520
Dino wants an amp.
I should have told him to fuck off ?

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:57.510
- Yes.
- Yes ? Wow, hot damn !

1:18:05.510 --> 1:18:07.510
- Drive on !
- Are you crazy ?

1:18:07.510 --> 1:18:09.500
I'll makeyougo on foot.

1:18:13.510 --> 1:18:14.520
- Hello, guys.
- Where to ?

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.520
- Well, down there.
- That's fate. Get in !

1:18:23.510 --> 1:18:24.520
No, no, let me...

1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:34.500
MARIJA AND LUKA, 2011

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:47.510
What is your plan, girls ?

1:18:47.510 --> 1:18:51.500
First Trogir, my folks,
then catch some party.

1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:53.500
We're going to one ourselves.

1:18:53.500 --> 1:18:55.500
- Which one ?
- Sunshine.

1:18:55.510 --> 1:18:57.510
- The first year.
- It's a new thing ?

1:18:57.510 --> 1:18:59.510
A friend is putting it together.

1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:02.500
- So it should be good.
- He says it will be packed.

1:19:02.500 --> 1:19:04.510
- Shall we go ?
- We have to back him up.

1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:08.510
- You coming with us ?
- Where ?

1:19:08.510 --> 1:19:10.500
To the party.
Admission sorted out,

1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:12.510
drinks too, and we're
leaving for Split tomorrow.

1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:13.520
I knew it...

1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:16.500
Trogir is just in and out.
Not much to do there.

1:19:16.510 --> 1:19:18.510
We said we'd pick up Sanja.

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:21.520
- Can Sanja come too ?
- Can she ? Of course !

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:23.520
Sanja's coming too, Luka !

1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:26.500
Luka, Sanja is coming too.

1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:27.510
Guys...

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:29.510
Can you get some shit there ?

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:32.520
Oh, can we ?
We have a buddy there.

1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:35.510
Now you're talking.
They have a man there.

1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:37.510
We're gonna get lucky, Luka.

1:19:39.500 --> 1:19:41.500
So, girls, are you coming ?

1:19:42.510 --> 1:19:44.510
- Drive on !
- You're coming too ?

1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:48.520
- Yes ! You're girls of action.
- Well, it is summer, right ?

1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:51.500
Exactly !
Luka, it's summer !

1:20:31.510 --> 1:20:33.500
Come out, pussies !

1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:38.520
How you been, Dino ?
Motherfucker !

1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:41.510
Hello, sunshine.
Throwing up some weight, huh ?

1:20:41.510 --> 1:20:43.520
Just a bit. But look
at yourself, you fat pig !

1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:46.500
- Cut the crap.
- This place is packed !

1:20:46.500 --> 1:20:47.510
It's gonna be a bedlam.

1:20:48.510 --> 1:20:50.510
- Wow, it's been so long.
- Hey, Dino.

1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:53.510
- High spirits as always, huh ?
- Right.

1:20:53.510 --> 1:20:54.510
So good to see you.

1:20:54.520 --> 1:20:56.500
Girls, this is Dino.

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:58.500
- Pleased to meet you.
- Petra, hi.

1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:00.500
- Dinka.
- There's a pretty name.

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:02.510
Told them you're going to be
the best host ever.

1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:04.500
Let's get ourselves a drink.

1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:06.510
- The amp is in the car.
- I almost forgot.

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:10.520
Dara ! Give these people a drink.
Forget the tourists.

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.500
- What will you have ?
- A beer.

1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:14.500
- You ?
- A beer.

1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:15.520
- A beer too.
- Bring five beers.

1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:17.510
Dara, have yourself one, too.

1:21:18.510 --> 1:21:21.520
- Wow, Dara looks all worn out.
- Cause she gave it to everybody.

1:21:22.510 --> 1:21:24.520
A free Dara for everybody.

1:21:28.510 --> 1:21:30.510
- So, everything set ?
- Right.

1:21:30.510 --> 1:21:31.520
- Seen the website ?
- Sure.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:34.500
You've grown
all active on me lately.

1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:38.510
No need for university in the city.
Just watch people and harvest.

1:21:38.510 --> 1:21:40.520
Right you are.
Way to go, Colombo.

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:43.500
You're OK, girls ?

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:45.520
- I'm happy to see you.
- That was his fault.

1:21:47.510 --> 1:21:50.500
- You're going to see your folks ?
- I'll have to.

1:21:50.510 --> 1:21:53.500
Sure. It's been a while.

1:21:55.510 --> 1:21:57.520
- Your mom rarely comes out.
- Really ?

1:21:58.510 --> 1:22:02.500
- And Dad ?
- Your Dad is OK, They are both fine.

1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:07.500
- You could have paid a visit.
- And you could have jerked off less.

1:22:10.510 --> 1:22:13.510
- A toast !
- To the first year of Sunshine !

1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:15.520
Let's have at least two more.

1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:20.500
- Is this settled ?
- Will put it on the tab.

1:22:20.510 --> 1:22:22.510
- Then do it now.
- Fuck off, not now.

1:22:22.510 --> 1:22:25.510
- Tell me, where have you meet ?
- A twist of fate.

1:22:25.510 --> 1:22:28.510
- We picked them up on the road.
- You were hitchhiking ?

1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.520
You shouldn't do that.
There are all kinds of morons.

1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:34.500
- My mom told me that.
- You should listen to her.

1:22:34.510 --> 1:22:37.520
- And now that you've said it...
- Forget me, listen to your mother.

1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:40.510
What a heartbreaker, huh ?

1:22:40.510 --> 1:22:42.510
There's no one like me
in the city, huh ?

1:22:43.500 --> 1:22:44.510
- Where to ?
- The house.

1:22:44.510 --> 1:22:46.520
- Really ?
- Fuck, what can I do now ?

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.510
- We're gonna be here.
- OK.

1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:52.520
- No need to hurry.
- Say hello to your mom !

1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:55.500
- How about a shot ?
- Sure.

1:22:55.510 --> 1:22:58.500
- A shot, or a line ?
- A shot, then a line.

1:23:29.510 --> 1:23:30.510
Dad.

1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.500
Why didn't you let us know ?

1:23:44.510 --> 1:23:46.520
- How have you been ?
- Gettin' along.

1:23:47.510 --> 1:23:50.500
- You've stooped a bit.
- Probably.

1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:53.510
Let's go upstairs.

1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:56.520
Come, there's food.

1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:15.520
Who were you talking to ?

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:19.510
You can see for yourself.

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:24.500
Luka...

1:24:26.510 --> 1:24:27.510
How come ?

1:24:28.510 --> 1:24:30.520
Well... passing by.

1:24:38.500 --> 1:24:43.510
Go on, sit down. You're all skinny.
Eating anything up there ?

1:24:43.510 --> 1:24:45.500
- I'm OK.
- Sit down.

1:25:02.510 --> 1:25:04.500
How's university going ?

1:25:05.510 --> 1:25:08.500
Not bad.
I just passed two exams.

1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:11.520
- You have to eat more. Here...
- There's no need.

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:13.520
Give him.
You have to eat.

1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:19.510
What's got into you, wife ?

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:39.520
You've come for the party, right ?

1:25:40.510 --> 1:25:43.510
- I saw it. A lot of young people.
- Yeah, me too.

1:25:53.510 --> 1:25:56.510
- Will you stay the night here ?
- We're leaving right after.

1:25:58.500 --> 1:25:59.500
Ivno too ?

1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:08.510
- Where are you going ?
- Split.

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:11.520
We're staying at a colleague's
from the university.

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.510
You should come here more often.

1:26:26.510 --> 1:26:28.500
Don't blame yourself so much.

1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:39.520
Do you hear me ?

1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:44.510
It was best for you.

1:26:49.500 --> 1:26:51.510
You were born for the city,
nothing to do here.

1:26:51.510 --> 1:26:53.510
- Fuck the city, Dad.
- Stop swearing.

1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:56.510
Time will be the judge.

1:26:56.520 --> 1:26:59.500
Well, time is passing, Mother.

1:27:00.510 --> 1:27:02.500
And it's getting worse.

1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:08.510
You liked what he did.

1:27:09.510 --> 1:27:11.510
- It's not true.
- You're turning it around.

1:27:11.510 --> 1:27:13.510
- Don't...
- It's true.

1:27:13.510 --> 1:27:15.520
You know well it is.

1:27:17.500 --> 1:27:19.510
That's why I don't like coming here.

1:27:24.510 --> 1:27:28.510
You have to... visit
your Dad and Mom.

1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:43.500
- I have to go.
- Already ?

1:27:43.510 --> 1:27:45.500
That's Ivno. I'm off.

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:48.500
Are you sure you won't
stay the night ?

1:27:48.510 --> 1:27:49.510
Take care.

1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:51.520
When will we see you again ?

1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:54.510
I have no idea.

1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:13.510
Here he comes...

1:28:46.510 --> 1:28:48.500
- Hey.
- Where have you been ?

1:28:48.500 --> 1:28:49.510
- I'm here now.
- Get in.

1:28:49.510 --> 1:28:52.510
- Go, I'll walk there.
- Cut the crap !

1:28:52.510 --> 1:28:55.500
We have the honor of
going with the coordinator.

1:28:56.510 --> 1:28:58.520
- I'll stay with my folks a bit.
- Everything OK ?

1:28:58.520 --> 1:29:00.500
- You sure ?
- Yes.

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:03.500
When you come there,
just use my name as reference.

1:29:05.510 --> 1:29:07.500
Go on, see you later.

1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.500
Bye !

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:39.510
Can I come in ?

1:32:10.500 --> 1:32:12.500
You've set it up nicely.

1:32:15.500 --> 1:32:17.520
My brother sends some money
every now and then.

1:32:20.510 --> 1:32:22.500
How come you're here ?

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:26.500
I don't know.

1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:30.510
Am I bothering you ?

1:32:33.500 --> 1:32:34.500
Sit down.

1:32:39.510 --> 1:32:41.500
- Will you have a drink ?
- No.

1:33:12.510 --> 1:33:13.520
How have you been ?

1:33:18.510 --> 1:33:19.510
Fine.

1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:24.500
How's the city ?

1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:29.500
Not bad.

1:33:29.510 --> 1:33:30.510
Not bad, right.

1:33:31.510 --> 1:33:33.510
Only the weather is always bad.

1:33:34.510 --> 1:33:37.510
It's been raining for three days
just now.

1:33:39.510 --> 1:33:41.510
- Rain...
- But otherwise...

1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:47.510
I've been studying hard
at the university.

1:33:48.500 --> 1:33:50.510
- Soon I'll be done.
- Great.

1:33:51.510 --> 1:33:54.520
- Two more exams.
- Two exams... that's not much.

1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:59.500
Perhaps I'll find a job, God give.

1:33:59.510 --> 1:34:01.510
Some kind of an assistant.

1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:05.500
And when did you come ?

1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:07.520
- Today. By car.
- Today, by car...

1:34:09.500 --> 1:34:11.500
- Ivno was driving ?
- Yes.

1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:15.520
And then you certainly
visited your folks.

1:34:16.500 --> 1:34:17.510
- I did.
- How is your mom ?

1:34:21.500 --> 1:34:23.510
- Mom is ok.
- What are you doing here ?

1:34:25.510 --> 1:34:27.510
- I came to...
- What the fuck are you doing here ?

1:34:27.510 --> 1:34:29.510
- I want to tell you I'm sorry.
- You're sorry ?

1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:32.500
You ran like a pussy,
now you're sorry.

1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:36.500
- Your mom knows you're here ?
- She doesn't need to know.

1:34:36.500 --> 1:34:38.500
She doesn't care
you're in a Serbian house ?

1:34:38.500 --> 1:34:40.510
- I don't give a fuck !
- Stop yelling !

1:34:57.510 --> 1:34:58.510
Mare, here I am.

1:35:03.510 --> 1:35:05.500
I'm here, only that matters.

1:35:20.510 --> 1:35:21.520
Are you listening to me ?

1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:26.500
Do you understand
what I'm telling you ?

1:35:28.500 --> 1:35:30.500
I don't care
what anybody thinks !

1:35:31.510 --> 1:35:33.510
I'm here because
I want to be here !

1:35:35.500 --> 1:35:36.520
I won't leave here.

1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:40.510
I want to be here with you.

1:35:42.510 --> 1:35:43.510
Both of you.

1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:53.520
It's over now.

1:36:17.510 --> 1:36:18.510
May I see him ?

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:26.510
Mare, please.

1:37:52.510 --> 1:37:54.500
Forgive me.

1:37:57.510 --> 1:37:58.520
Go away.

1:38:01.510 --> 1:38:03.500
Please forgive me.

1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:05.510
- Get away from me. Go !
- Please, Mare.

1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:08.500
- Go on, get lost.
- Don't send me away.

1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:12.500
- If you need anything...
- Get out. It's over now.

1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:15.500
- Leave us. we're OK. Get lost !
- I am sorry !

1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:17.520
I'm sorry.
