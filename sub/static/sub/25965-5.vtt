very exclusively, I just --

14:37.878 --> 14:39.510
It was a very natural thing
that Kelvin and I

14:39.546 --> 14:41.279
would start to build rapport,

14:41.314 --> 14:42.380

working together

14:42.415 --> 14:43.848

14:43.884 --> 14:47.285

exponential with each fight.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.753
The first thing
that we're gonna do

14:48.788 --> 14:50.321

A skips, but they're designed

14:56.630 --> 14:58.129

-Lift.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.832
Lift is where you separate
your foot from the ground

15:00.867 --> 15:04.102
and bring your knee up
into a chamber position.

15:04.137 --> 15:07.338
That's where we get all of our
explosiveness off the ground.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.075
My style of coaching is just
meet the athlete where they are,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.578

in the moment,

15:13.613 --> 15:16.781

thousands of sequences

15:16.816 --> 15:18.483

that I can offer for them,

getting too close to Michel,

Bea has the Muay Thai style,

if we can get a hold of Leah

and get those knees in there,

being the taller fighter,
