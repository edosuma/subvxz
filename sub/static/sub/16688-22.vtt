WEBVTT

00:09.760 --> 00:12.340
( Earl sighs )
Like I've been saying,

00:12.440 --> 00:14.260
Pops is the chosen one.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.780
He must begin his training
immediately,

00:16.880 --> 00:20.540
or AntiâPops will destroy him
and the universe as we know it.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.860
Why should we believe
any of this nonsense?

00:22.960 --> 00:24.960
How do we even know
you're telling the truth?

00:24.680 --> 00:27.300
Yeah, are you sure <i>ourPops is</i>
the chosen one?

00:27.400 --> 00:29.100
Maybe you, uh ââ
maybe you got the wrong guy.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.220
I mean, look at him.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.100
Ooh!
( Laughs )

00:32.200 --> 00:34.980
Huh? Oh, hello.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.260
Pops is much stronger
than he looks.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.860
You cannot begin to comprehend
the power he has within him.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.620
What kind of fighting style
are you gonna teach Pops?

00:43.720 --> 00:45.700
I think you should teach him
Krav Maga.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.900
Or Death Kwon Do.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.300
Pops has no need
for such insignificant ââ

00:49.400 --> 00:51.220
Maybe he could use
the Fist of Justice.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.260
He ââ
Is Pops gonna get

00:52.360 --> 00:54.360
cool powers and stuff?

00:53.400 --> 00:54.500
I think ââ
Oh! Is he gonna

00:54.600 --> 00:55.940
shoot fire
out of his fingers?

00:56.040 --> 00:57.260
That's not a thing!

00:57.360 --> 00:59.360
What kind of award
does Pops get if he wins?

00:59.240 --> 01:01.240
Yeah! We got to go
on a world tour with Pops!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.400
Is he gonna have to
go somewhere?

01:01.880 --> 01:04.780
( All talking indistinctly )
( Groaning )

01:04.880 --> 01:06.820
Enough!
We need to take this seriously!

01:06.920 --> 01:08.780
Pops and AntiâPops

01:08.880 --> 01:11.820
are the reason for the universe
as we know it.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.500
Everything that exists

01:13.600 --> 01:17.160
is but a battleground
for their celestial forms.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.500
Every 14 billion years,

01:21.600 --> 01:23.820
they battle for dominance,

01:23.920 --> 01:26.860
but they are two sides
of the same coin,

01:26.960 --> 01:30.460
their powers in perfect balance.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.940
Every time,
the battle ends in stalemate,

01:33.040 --> 01:35.580
and the universe resets anew.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.300
But this time,
it can be different.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.620
With my help, Pops can break the
cycle and save this universe.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.900
All: Whoa!

01:45.000 --> 01:46.940
Titan? Universe?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.300
I'm just Pops.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.220
This doesn't seem right.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.940
I don't know, Pops.
This sounds really serious.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.580
I think
you have to do this.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.540
But I don't want
to fight anyone.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.020
You can and will!

01:58.120 --> 02:00.580
Wait a minute. How do we know
this isn't all a load?

02:00.680 --> 02:01.740
Yeah, we want proof.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.500
Oh, you want proof?

02:03.600 --> 02:07.220
Every time the cycle starts
over, I get a tattoo on my...

02:07.320 --> 02:08.620
Uh...
What's happening
right now?

02:08.720 --> 02:10.720
...body!

02:12.520 --> 02:14.780
Frankly,
I'm running out of space.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.580
I will unlock
your power, Pops.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.680
Training starts now!

02:20.720 --> 02:22.340
Let us begin.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.300
Socks?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.300
Yes.
My socks, Pops.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.580
We must fold them.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.740
Okay.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.260
Chase the rabbit
'round the tail,

02:30.360 --> 02:31.900
then insert his fluffy ââ

02:32.000 --> 02:33.180
No!
Aah!

02:33.280 --> 02:35.280
Do as I do.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.980
Now you try.

02:38.080 --> 02:42.420
Fold, tuck,
then place in hamper.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.460
( Whimpers )

02:43.560 --> 02:45.700
( Sighs )
Again. Again!

02:45.800 --> 02:47.380
What the heck?
This is lame.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.580
Yeah, where's the cool training
we were promised?

02:49.680 --> 02:51.260
Together: Hmm.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.060
HmâHmâHmâHmâHm!

02:53.160 --> 02:56.340
Now it is time
to make lemonade.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.220
That sounds delightful!

02:58.320 --> 03:00.060
No!
Not delightful!

03:00.160 --> 03:01.700
Grab a lemon.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.180
Now squeeze it.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.940
( Grunts )

03:05.040 --> 03:06.500
Clear your mind.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.980
The lemon is your foe.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.660
He does not want to yield
his precious golden fluids,

03:11.760 --> 03:13.340
so you must crush him!

03:13.440 --> 03:15.440
( Grunting )

03:15.840 --> 03:17.380
Good. Yes.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.860
Now do that
a million times!

03:18.960 --> 03:20.500
( Groans )

03:20.600 --> 03:22.180
( Slurp )

03:22.280 --> 03:23.700
Ahh.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.180
Pops, look
at these bushes.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.620
So unkempt.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.940
Now, simply do as I do.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.040
( Grunts )

03:32.720 --> 03:33.740
You see? Easy.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.620
But I don't want
to hit a tree.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.580
Just do it!

03:36.680 --> 03:38.420
( Whimpers )

03:38.520 --> 03:40.100
Okay, okay.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.140
This feels like a good place
to take a 10âminute break.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.740
But before we resume, I want you
to ponder this ancient haiku.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.900
Darkness ahead strong.
My body frail like dried leaves.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.380
Wise master so cool.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.180
Okay.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.820
This guy is full of it.
Yeah!

04:00.920 --> 04:02.540
I think Earl's
a big, fat fraud!

04:02.640 --> 04:04.980
Oh, you got
something to say?

04:05.080 --> 04:07.200
Yeah. When are you gonna
teach him something useful?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.740
I am.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.840
Whatever, dude.
While you're folding socks,

04:10.160 --> 04:12.160
AntiâPops is probably off
somewhere learning

04:11.840 --> 04:13.840
how to shoot fire
out of his fingers.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.220
You're really hung up

04:14.320 --> 04:16.320
on that fire
out of the fingers thing.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.740
Because it's cool!

04:16.840 --> 04:18.100
Remind me again ââ

04:18.200 --> 04:22.460
how many intergalactic champions
have you trained, huh?

04:22.560 --> 04:24.780
Is it zero?
It's zero.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.380
Right? Right?

04:26.480 --> 04:27.540
Knock it off, dude!

04:27.640 --> 04:29.180
( Laughs )

04:29.280 --> 04:30.460
I bet you couldn't even

04:30.560 --> 04:32.820
knock this lemonade
out of my hand.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.940
Huh? Huh? Huh?

04:35.040 --> 04:37.620
( Parody of "Kill Bill"
fight theme plays )

04:37.720 --> 04:38.980
( Screams )

04:39.080 --> 04:40.100
Hooâaah!

04:40.200 --> 04:42.200
Aah ââ Huh?

04:42.640 --> 04:43.700
( Grunts )

04:43.800 --> 04:46.540
( Laughs )
I could stand here all day.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.640
You make
a nice foot stool.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.500
Aah! Ooh!

04:52.600 --> 04:54.260
( Laughs )

04:54.360 --> 04:56.220
( Straining )
Okay! You're legit!

04:56.320 --> 04:58.320
( Chuckles )

05:00.880 --> 05:02.880
I don't want to let you down.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.940
But I'll never be as strong
as AntiâPops.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.740
Stop talking
to that sad picture!

05:08.840 --> 05:10.840
Break's over!

05:16.120 --> 05:18.180
( Laughs )

05:18.280 --> 05:20.780
Wax apply, wax remove.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.100
Wax apply, wax remove.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.580
( Panting )

05:25.680 --> 05:27.940
Now let's try it
with water in the buckets.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.500
( Grunting )

05:29.600 --> 05:31.340
Aah! Ooh!

05:31.440 --> 05:33.440
( Squeaking )

05:38.440 --> 05:39.340
( Slurp )

05:39.440 --> 05:40.500
Mmm.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.220
Time to freshen
my cup.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.700
Keep folding
my undershirts.

05:44.800 --> 05:48.220
It is a very important part
of your training.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.100
Rigby: Psst! Pops!

05:50.200 --> 05:52.060
Huh?
How's training going?

05:52.160 --> 05:53.460
Terrible.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.340
Earl hasn't taught me
anything.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.180
Earl:
Haven't taught you anything?!

05:57.280 --> 05:59.060
( Gasps )
Busted.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.220
Uh...I'm sorry,
but it's the truth!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.500
Your training
makes no sense!

06:04.600 --> 06:07.380
I think you're simply too lazy
to do your own chores,

06:07.480 --> 06:11.100
and I'm fed up with being
your personal chambermaid!

06:11.200 --> 06:14.660
Also, I think
you are thoroughly unpleasant.

06:14.760 --> 06:15.780
Oh, snap.
Dang!

06:15.880 --> 06:16.900
Ooh, burn!
Oh, man.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.540
Oh, no, he didn't.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.900
I don't want
any part of this.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.700
You can fight AntiâPops
for all I care.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.060
Even if I wanted to,
I cannot.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.620
You are the chosen one.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.060
I don't want to be
the chosen one.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.780
If you do not become stronger
than AntiâPops, he will

06:31.880 --> 06:34.860
erase everything you hold near
and dear from existence.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.900
I refuse to train!

06:37.000 --> 06:38.100
( Groans )

06:38.200 --> 06:41.660
Pops, I understand
your frustration.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.460
It is good that your will
is strong.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.500
I was going to wait
to show you this

06:46.600 --> 06:49.860
in fear that it would be
too overwhelming.

06:49.960 --> 06:53.780
But this is my last resort
to convince you.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.140
What is that?

06:55.240 --> 06:58.260
A fragment
from a previous universe.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.800
It will show the consequences
of your decisions.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.660
( Tink )

07:03.760 --> 07:05.420
( Gasps )

07:05.520 --> 07:07.700
Where am I?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.300
Oh, my!

07:09.400 --> 07:12.500
It's...It's...me!

07:12.600 --> 07:14.100
Yeah! Go!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.380
Go, Titan Pops!

07:15.480 --> 07:17.480
Remember our training!

07:20.800 --> 07:25.060
( Gasps )
AntiâPops?

07:25.160 --> 07:27.460
( Growls )
( Growls )

07:27.560 --> 07:28.660
Stop!

07:28.760 --> 07:30.760
Stop fighting!

07:38.480 --> 07:40.480
( Roars )

07:57.120 --> 07:59.120
Bad show.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.280
Aah!

08:06.120 --> 08:08.120
No!

08:17.560 --> 08:20.720
( Roaring )

08:25.160 --> 08:26.220
Oh, dang it.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.260
This part always hurts.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.580
Aah!!

08:30.680 --> 08:32.300
Huh?
Fellows!

08:32.400 --> 08:35.000
The universe, it's vanishing!

08:37.640 --> 08:40.620
No!!

08:40.720 --> 08:42.380
Aah!!

08:42.480 --> 08:43.780
Bad show! Bad show!

08:43.880 --> 08:45.380
Pops,
dude, what is it?

08:45.480 --> 08:47.480
Are you okay?
What happened?
Are you okay?

08:47.120 --> 08:50.060
I just want things to go back
to how they were!

08:50.160 --> 08:51.820
( Crying )

08:51.920 --> 08:53.020
Pops, wait!

08:53.120 --> 08:54.180
What did you show him?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.780
Only the truth.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.020
Not cool, Earl.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.660
Sometimes the truth
is not cool.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.020
Ugh. Whatever.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.120
Let's go get Pops.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.420
Get to my safe place.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.660
Get to my safe place.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.020
Get to my safe place.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.300
Get to my safe place.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.940
( Crying )

09:12.040 --> 09:13.060
( All calling "Pops" )

09:13.160 --> 09:15.160
Yooâhoo!
Hey, don't run away.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.940
Hey, what's that?

09:22.040 --> 09:24.040
Dude, over there!

09:33.120 --> 09:35.300
Hey, Pops.
You okay?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.860
What is this place?

09:36.960 --> 09:38.180
I brought my things here

09:38.280 --> 09:40.780
when my room was turned into
the control room.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.880
I've been coming here
to get away

09:42.320 --> 09:44.780
from all this
destiny nonsense.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.940
( Sighs )

09:46.040 --> 09:47.540
Everything's changing,

09:47.640 --> 09:50.820
and it's up to me to stop it,
but what if I can't?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.700
What if I can't do it?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.380
It's okay
to be scared, Pops.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.020
We're all scared.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.180
Yeah, I'm, like,
super scared.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.060
I'm not gonna pretend
that we can relate,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.060
but we know
you can do this,

10:02.160 --> 10:03.940
and we'll be with you
every step of the way.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.940
That goes
for all of us.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.860
Yeah, we got
your back, Pops.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.020
Yes, Pops.
We are all here to help you.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.860
You needn't be afraid.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.460
Hey, Pops.
Yes?

10:14.560 --> 10:15.540
Catch!

10:15.640 --> 10:17.700
Aah!

10:17.800 --> 10:19.300
( Grunting )

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
( All gasp )

10:24.160 --> 10:25.940
Cool.
What the...?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.340
( Laughs )

10:27.440 --> 10:28.740
Very good.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.660
Now your real training
can begin.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.760
That's way cooler
than Krav Maga.
