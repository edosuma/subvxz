(THUNDER RUMBLES)

00:08.760 --> 00:12.400
Oh, those things will
be the death of you.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.960
Plus, I'm not having you go
downstairs with your head

00:14.960 --> 00:16.600
wreathed in smoke.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.160
Steam.
Oh, whatever.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.560
It looks like your head's on fire.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.640
Got some business.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.760
Seriously?

00:36.480 --> 00:39.800
It won't take long.
Oh, Victor.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.600
You don't have to win every time.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.080
Evening, sir.
How are you doing?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.520
Thank you very much.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.840
(CHEERING)

01:37.920 --> 01:39.720
You could at least crack a smile.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.320
It's hard to know where Victor's
arse ends and Joshua's lips begin.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.840
All these people are here
to celebrate your birthday,

01:50.840 --> 01:53.520
the least you can do
is raise a glass.

02:01.640 --> 02:02.880
Oh, no, I shouldn't.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.760
Listen, one of us
should be drinking.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.800
And seeing as I can't,
it might as well be my sister.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.440
You promise?
The baby is safe, Alicia. OK?

02:13.880 --> 02:15.840
WOMAN: How dare you?!

02:18.760 --> 02:21.560
(LAUGHS) It's the truth.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.080
And I've got the photos to prove it!

02:29.000 --> 02:31.480
Don't you walk away from me!

02:38.200 --> 02:40.640
(SCREAMS)

02:48.160 --> 02:49.840
I never touched him.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.360
I promise.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.280
He was dead before I...

02:58.360 --> 03:01.800
Good evening. I'm Inspector Doppler.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.920
Doppler of the Yard, they call me.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.120
Sadly, it's my duty
to inform that you this

03:11.120 --> 03:12.960
is now a crime scene.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.880
If you'd like to return to the hall,

03:14.880 --> 03:17.360
I shall address you
in a few moments.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.320
(DOOR CLOSES)

03:26.000 --> 03:27.640
What do you think, Mum?
Too much blood?

03:27.640 --> 03:30.320
Well, it is the jugular.
It's bound to spurt.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.640
Shame. Nice shirt, that.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.760
Right, let's see if anyone's
bright enough to solve the mystery.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.520
One of your best, I think.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.120
Hugo. Glasses.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.240
Oh, yes, glasses.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.840
Rest of the character.

03:55.240 --> 04:01.720
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my job to uncover the identity

04:01.720 --> 04:06.080
of a murderer who hides
in plain sight.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.680
Now, I should warn you,
unravelling this won't be easy.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.600
There will be lies.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.640
There will be red herrings.

04:13.640 --> 04:17.960
There may even be more murders.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.760
I'm...I'm just gonna go upstairs.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.720
It's nothing. I'm fine.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.920
Can you beat me to it?
Do you have what it takes?

04:27.920 --> 04:30.200
(COUGHS)

04:30.200 --> 04:33.360
(COUGHS, SPUTTERS, GASPS)

04:33.360 --> 04:35.560
(CHOKES, GASPS)
Victor?!

04:37.160 --> 04:38.920
Somebody help him!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.360
Victor!

04:51.680 --> 04:53.840
(ALL APPLAUD)

05:01.720 --> 05:04.120
(SCREAMS)

06:10.400 --> 06:13.160
Where's the tortoise?
WOMAN: What?

06:13.160 --> 06:15.160
I can't find the tortoise.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.640
Well, it must be somewhere.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.640
Betty always plays
with the tortoise.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.600
Why can't things be put
back where they, I mean,

06:21.600 --> 06:22.640
how hard, is it?

06:22.640 --> 06:25.040
It's a perfectly good game
and now it's...

06:25.040 --> 06:26.360
Look, I don't think it matters.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.800
And when she comes down
from her bath, neither will Betty.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.280
I'm going to take a wild guess
and say this isn't really

06:33.280 --> 06:35.000
about a missing board-game piece.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.560
Oh, there's some hidden
meaning, is there?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.840
Well, you tell me. You've been
in a foul mood all evening.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.600
I just don't like losing things.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.080
Well, I'm sure Betty
and I will bear that in mind.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.360
(PHONE RINGS)

06:45.360 --> 06:46.680
Yes. Winter.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.720
Really?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.240
Yes, of course. I'll see you there.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.640
You have to go?
Don't wait up.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.000
You know, not everything
has to mean something.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.320
Says the detective.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.120
Nice togs, sir.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.680
Very Fisherman's Friend.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.560
Mm. I find it beats drowned rat.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.080
Victor Karras.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.680
Head of Karras Games.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.080
Board games, mainly.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.120
High-end stuff, old-fashioned,
beautifully made.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.040
Apparently very classy.
We bought Betty one.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.520
Does she play it?
When we've got all the pieces.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.640
Never mind.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.200
Access by chain ferry only.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.680
They don't make it easy, do they?

07:49.680 --> 07:53.640
Well, perhaps Victor Karras
valued his privacy.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.120
Or his safety.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.280
I'd say that was a bit less
successful, wouldn't you?

08:04.240 --> 08:08.280
They're all life-size replicas of
various Karras games apparently.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.160
Probably wishes now they didn't
include Dogman here.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.600
Anubis.
Sorry?

08:16.760 --> 08:18.600
Anubis.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.120
Embalmer, protector of tombs.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.480
The god who got to
decide a soul's fate.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.280
Closet Egyptology expert?

08:28.280 --> 08:30.720
Closet The Mummy Returns fan.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.360
So, this is just a nasty
accident, isn't it?

08:36.360 --> 08:39.200
It would be if Anubis here
had actually done him in.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.320
He didn't?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.040
Cyanide.
Poison?

08:46.040 --> 08:48.760
You're sure?
As much as I can be at this stage.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.880
Bright red, see?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.040
Tell-tale sign.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.240
Cyanide prevents the cells
from using oxygen.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.000
So the bright red oxyhaemoglobin
stays in the blood.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.840
The poor chap was as good as dead
long before Anubis got involved.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.040
Any idea how the cyanide
was administered?

09:10.040 --> 09:13.280
Most likely in something he ate
or drank, don't you think?

09:13.280 --> 09:16.080
And how fast, afterwards?

09:16.080 --> 09:19.320
Anything from, say,
two to 15 minutes.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.240
Half an hour, tops.
So, time of death?

09:23.240 --> 09:28.080
Most witnesses have it at between
10 past and quarter past eight,

09:28.080 --> 09:29.720
which seems about right.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.840
Let's find out what Victor Karras
did, where he went, what he ate

09:34.840 --> 09:37.160
and drank in the
half-hour before he died.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.480
That's our window.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.480
I understand this isn't easy,
Mrs Karras, but I'd like to know

09:57.480 --> 10:00.520
about your movements
from around 7:30.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.520
We were in the bedroom.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.720
Josh was there, too.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.720
Josh?

10:08.720 --> 10:10.200
Joshua Kilbride.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.160
He's been Victor's assistant
for years.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.000
He needed Victor's signature
on a couple of things.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.560
Why do I have to do this now?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.880
Don't want anything
hanging over us, do we?

10:22.880 --> 10:24.800
Not on your big night.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.280
You'll thank me in the morning.
I doubt it.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.440
Pay no attention, Joshua.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.800
I never do.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.640
Those things will be
the death of you.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.600
One a day, that was the rule.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.480
The doctor told him so and
he'd already vaped in the morning.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.960
You said your husband had a whisky?

10:56.480 --> 10:57.760
Josh had one, too.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.160
And then you went to the party?

11:02.760 --> 11:04.400
Not right away.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.240
Victor had some
business to deal with.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.840
I don't know what or who with.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.320
Did your husband eat or drink
anything at the party?

11:16.320 --> 11:19.440
Some champagne, that's all.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.520
Er, he said he wasn't
feeling very well.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.640
I told him he had
to drink something.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.040
It was good manners.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.680
Is it possible someone could've
tampered with your husband's drink?

11:32.680 --> 11:35.680
Tampered? What do you mean?

11:35.680 --> 11:38.960
We believe your husband
was poisoned, Mrs Karras.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
Poisoned?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.360
Will you be OK?

11:46.360 --> 11:48.000
Crossing the Styx?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.320
As long as I remember
to pay the ferryman.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.520
Would you do me a favour?

11:51.520 --> 11:53.080
I'm going to be tied up here
a bit longer

11:53.080 --> 11:54.600
and I can't get a mobile signal.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.760
Do you want me to let Sarah know?
Tell her I'll be late.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.600
Yeah, and also that I'm...

12:03.680 --> 12:05.480
Just that I'll be late.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.360
I wouldn't hang about, though.
It's getting a bit biblical.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.520
Sir, I spoke to Helen Welles.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.440
It's her company that does
the murder mysteries.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.400
It's a bit of a family affair,
actually.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.960
Her husband's the detective
and her son's one of the waiters.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.080
What's her story?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.960
They were here
midafternoon to set up.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.960
Everything was done
through Joshua Kilbride,

12:29.960 --> 12:32.000
he's Victor Karras's PA.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.480
She didn't know Victor Karras?

12:33.480 --> 12:36.680
Met him for the first time today,
same with the caterers.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.600
We know Victor Karras
didn't eat anything.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.400
And the champagne came
from a fresh bottle.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.280
So right now, I'm only interested
in who was near enough to poison him

12:45.280 --> 12:46.800
under everybody else's noses.

12:46.800 --> 12:51.200
That's the immediate family
and the three murder mystery actors.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.240
The others, get their details.
They can go home.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.640
(THUNDER CRACKS)

12:56.640 --> 12:58.400
Maybe we should do the same.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.800
Right, just over there.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.600
Yeah, that way.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.960
Just a moment, please.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.480
It's the ferry.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.120
Prussic acid?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.440
There are bottles of the stuff
locked in a storeroom.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.520
The thing is, the key's
just on a nail outside.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.240
Anyone could have got it.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.440
So...

15:32.440 --> 15:35.000
So prussic acid is another name
for hydrogen cyanide.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.720
Mrs Karras?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.400
The ferry's gone.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.960
It just washed away.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.560
There's no other way off the island.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.320
What about a boat?

15:52.320 --> 15:56.280
The current just took out the ferry.
You wanna try it on a boat?

15:56.280 --> 15:59.280
So what are you saying? We're stuck?

15:59.280 --> 16:02.840
Until someone can work out
how to get us to the mainland,

16:02.840 --> 16:04.520
no-one's going anywhere.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you are aware,

16:15.320 --> 16:18.800
for the time being, none of us
is leaving this island.

16:18.800 --> 16:23.520
However, doesn't mean that
the investigation will stop.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.800
DS Winter here and I
will be talking to all of you.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.480
And I would like you to make
yourselves available at any time.

16:31.480 --> 16:35.840
Meanwhile, I'd like everyone's
mobile phones and computers.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.120
You're kidding.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.840
And you are?

16:39.840 --> 16:43.960
Danni Karras. Victor was my father.
And you can't just take our phones.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.840
I'm sure nobody minds, if it
helps them catch the murderer.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
I've got nothing to hide.
Oh, for God's sake, Danni.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.640
Just do as he asks. There's no
signal, it's not like you can...

16:51.640 --> 16:53.440
It's not about that.
She's just saying we have rights.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.880
I'm quite capable of speaking
for myself, thank you.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
Just saying.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.560
We do have to get
to the bottom of...

16:58.560 --> 17:00.480
I'm sorry. Who asked you?
Do you mind?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.640
He's my husband.
Please. Can we not row?

17:02.640 --> 17:04.720
It sounds like somebody here

17:04.720 --> 17:06.400
would prefer it if
the murderer wasn't found.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.800
Have you got something to say?
You tell me.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.200
I'm not the one
keeping my cards hidden.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.240
That's enough, all of you!

17:10.240 --> 17:11.880
Do you think this is
some sort of game?

17:14.600 --> 17:17.120
I watched my husband die tonight.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.240
Killed by someone in this room.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.120
Do whatever you need
to do, Inspector.

17:24.520 --> 17:29.000
You can hand over your devices
to Sergeant Winter on your way out.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.640
Those with laptops, please get them
and hand them in right away.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.000
So, the game's afoot.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.640
Hugo Welles.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.120
We have a lot in common.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.080
Really?

17:50.080 --> 17:53.320
We're both students
of the human mind, Inspector.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.720
The killer's psyche.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.400
Like you, I solve mysteries.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.120
I see.

18:01.120 --> 18:05.720
Restoring order to chaos,
righting wrongs.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.800
Please, look on me as a resource.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.720
We're gonna get to the bottom
of this. I know we are.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.240
We?

18:24.840 --> 18:28.000
It doesn't have a password on it.
Victor didn't think he needed it.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.240
You're not much of a fan
of Danni Karras, are you?

18:33.240 --> 18:36.240
Daddy's golden girl? Not much.
Because?

18:36.240 --> 18:39.800
She's greedy, ambitious and has
a fist where her heart ought to be.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.480
Do you think she could've
killed her father?

18:42.880 --> 18:45.440
Honestly? I've no idea.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.320
But whatever she might say,
trust me, she's not that sorry.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.840
Why not?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.400
Victor was meant to retire this year

18:51.400 --> 18:53.320
and Danni was all set to
take over the business.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
She'd already started
a big PR drive.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.120
Online, magazines,
newspapers, you name it.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.280
Company relaunch. The whole works.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.640
Only Victor changed his mind.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.240
How did she react?
Publicly? Full support.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.000
"My father's the company's
greatest asset." All that guff.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.000
And privately?
Not so much.

19:26.360 --> 19:30.480
You know, the only reason he drank
anything is because I made him.

19:31.680 --> 19:35.040
Because I said it would be polite.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.400
If that's how...
It's not your fault.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.560
I don't understand.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.840
One of us?

19:47.840 --> 19:50.840
They'll find out.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.480
They'll catch whoever did this.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.200
I promise.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.040
I didn't kill my father, Inspector.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.720
And certainly not for a job that
might not exist in six months' time.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.360
Is Karras Games in trouble?

20:11.080 --> 20:13.880
We're facing a hostile takeover bid.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.400
But we're fighting for survival.

20:15.400 --> 20:20.240
So as far as motives go, Inspector,
you may want to rethink.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.720
Can you tell me where
you were earlier this evening?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.520
At the party, like everyone else.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.520
All the time?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.560
I went out for a cigarette.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.800
Ever since Eleanor got him
to switch to vaping,

20:34.800 --> 20:37.320
Dad had got all
evangelical about fags.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.320
VICTOR: You think you can just
walk in here demanding money?

20:39.320 --> 20:42.040
WOMAN: I don't want your money.
What DO you want?

20:42.040 --> 20:45.440
For you to do the right thing.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.920
To admit that you lied
and cheated me.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.680
DANNI: I have no idea
what it was all about.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.760
After that, I went back inside,

20:51.760 --> 20:53.440
didn't want to be late
for the party.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.800
Three-line whip and all that.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.240
And at the party,
did you see your father?

20:57.240 --> 20:58.520
Not to talk to.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.560
Noah was still smarting.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.200
Noah?

21:03.200 --> 21:05.160
My partner.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.800
Earlier in the day,
he'd given Dad a present.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.440
Oh, you shouldn't have done.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.800
The platter that got broken
the other day, it's kintsugi.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.160
The Japanese art of
repairing broken pottery.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.160
You don't hide a repair.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.360
You accept it, celebrate it.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.040
Oh. This is, erm, glass,
not pottery.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.680
I had a bit of a scavenge.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.720
Salvaged some of the bits
I found in the bin today.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.000
And nothing's wasted.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.680
Beautiful, isn't it?

21:32.680 --> 21:36.440
I'm telling you,
kintsugi is the next big thing.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.960
I don't think Dad
was very impressed.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.480
With the present?
With the pitch.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.120
Noah's looking for investors.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.840
Dad made it pretty clear he wasn't
going to be one of them.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.440
How did that make Noah feel?

21:51.440 --> 21:55.000
I don't think he spiked Dad's drink,
if that's what you mean.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.800
But ask him.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.840
You never know, the head-on approach
might just crack the case wide open.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.600
I was Victor Karras's accountant
until about six months ago.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.920
Then he decided to take
his business elsewhere,

22:06.920 --> 22:08.280
that's how they describe it.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.120
He fired you.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.080
Well, there was a mix-up.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.240
It was a lot of nonsense.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.680
Victor's tax return
was late and he had to pay

22:16.680 --> 22:19.240
a hefty fine, thousands.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.240
He blamed Paul.
How did that make you feel?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.360
Clients come and go, Sergeant.
I got over it.

22:24.360 --> 22:30.200
Look...Victor invited us tonight
and we were happy to be here.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.040
What time did you come
down to the party?

22:38.040 --> 22:40.160
A little before eight.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.160
I remember because Paul
had his shot at 7:45.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.320
His shot?
B12. I'm anaemic.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.480
It stops me, you know, keeling over.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.080
And then?

22:50.080 --> 22:53.880
We both came down and were
in the hall right up until...

22:58.600 --> 23:01.000
I just keep seeing him.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.680
Victor on the floor just...

23:05.320 --> 23:07.960
Catch who did this,
Sergeant, please.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.040
(DOOR CLOSES)

23:14.040 --> 23:18.400
They'll be comparing
what we say, details,

23:18.400 --> 23:20.800
time lines, granular stuff.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.120
Really?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.680
Seeing if our stories match.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.920
That's what I'd do.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.080
What if they don't?

23:29.080 --> 23:30.720
It's easy to make a mistake.
Then what?

23:30.720 --> 23:32.280
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.520
A trained detective
can tell the difference

23:35.520 --> 23:37.680
between a mistake and a lie.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.520
Can they?
Oh, yes, there are signs.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.280
'Tells' we call them.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.440
It was the solution to the mystery
in Dead Beckoning, wasn't it?

23:47.440 --> 23:50.200
Hmm?
Murder at the yacht club.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.240
The victim was stabbed with
a pair of nautical dividers.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.640
Gosh.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.960
Oh, it was marvellous.
Hmm.

23:56.960 --> 24:01.000
The killer gave himself away
when Hugo pressed him on his alibi.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.920
With experience, you get
to recognise the signs.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.240
You can tell what
someone's thinking.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.320
Really?

24:09.320 --> 24:11.440
Can you tell what
I'm thinking right now?

24:21.200 --> 24:22.880
What are we going to do?

24:26.360 --> 24:28.840
It'll be OK. Trust me.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.720
You think it's one of them?

24:35.720 --> 24:37.720
Can't quite see it, can you?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.960
Then again, it might be me.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.640
They know about Dad changing
his mind and staying on.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.520
They say it gives me a motive.
That's crazy.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.000
It's also true.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.920
It's called Hounds and Jackals.

25:35.480 --> 25:39.000
They were playing it 4,000
years ago in Ancient Egypt.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm more of a draughts man, myself.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.400
Victor loved them. Games, puzzles.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.880
He had that sort of mind.
I can see.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.800
And that?

25:52.800 --> 25:56.760
It's a Japanese puzzle box,
very intricate,

25:56.760 --> 25:58.960
almost impossible to get into.

26:00.720 --> 26:04.120
Victor gave me this
for my last birthday.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.320
To bring me good luck.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.720
He hid it in there.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.760
Said if I could figure out how
to find it, I could keep it.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.560
And you did?
I did not.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.440
In the end, he took pity
on me and opened it.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.440
He waited until I was
out of the room, mind.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.680
So no idea how to get in?
Not a clue.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.240
I'm afraid reception's a bit patchy
around here at the best of times.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.920
I was hoping to call my wife.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.720
You might have a bit more
luck on the landline.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.720
Just no guarantee you'll get
to the end of your conversation.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.600
(GROANS)

26:42.840 --> 26:46.360
Mrs Karras?
I'm fine. It's just the baby.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.640
Do you have children, Inspector?
A little girl.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.400
Oh, this one's a boy,
I'm sure of it.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.600
What does Danielle make
of you being pregnant?

26:59.600 --> 27:02.160
She's been an only child
for a long time.

27:02.160 --> 27:05.880
I don't worry too much
what my stepdaughter thinks.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.480
Besides, it doesn't really matter.
I'm not keeping it.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.040
I'm a surrogate for my sister.
Alicia?

27:14.040 --> 27:18.120
She wants a baby and can't conceive.
I don't and can.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.600
It's the obvious solution.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.280
I hope it works.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.800
And I've arranged a room
for you and your sergeant.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.000
You'll find toothbrushes and some
of Victor's pyjamas on the bed.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.560
Thank you.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.400
Landline's down too, then?
Looks like it.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.440
Oh, Victor's?
Yeah.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.240
Bit on the generous side.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.520
Still, yours should fit OK.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.360
Why?
Oh, I gave them a rinse.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.200
Who knows how long
they'll have to last?

27:59.200 --> 28:01.640
I just turn mine inside out, sir.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.000
Oh, I asked about
the, erm, prussic acid.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.680
Apparently, it was left over
from when the house was fumigated

28:10.680 --> 28:12.040
a few years ago.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.920
No-one thought to get rid of it.

28:17.480 --> 28:20.080
You don't snore, do you, Winter?
Certainly not.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.000
Although I'm told that
I do breathe heavily.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.440
And grind my teeth. And talk.

28:32.560 --> 28:33.760
RADIO: Several villages

28:33.760 --> 28:36.080
along the banks of the river
have been evacuated.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.160
Oh, I don't know if
he's tried calling.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.080
The landline's down too.
I blame Brenda.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.360
The storm. They gave it a name.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.440
They chose Brenda?
Yeah, apparently.

28:48.440 --> 28:52.760
It doesn't fully capture the raw,
elemental power of nature, does it?

28:52.760 --> 28:57.000
Anyway, John wanted me to let you
know he was going to be late.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.400
Oh, that's nice of him.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.000
Only now he's not
coming home at all.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
What?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.720
The chain ferry's gone,
you can't get a boat across

29:04.720 --> 29:07.760
and there's no
other way off the island.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.680
What, he's trapped?
Er, marooned.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.880
It's not like they're in any danger.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.520
Apart from the obvious.
What, being flooded?

29:17.520 --> 29:21.960
If only. No, they're stuck
in the house with a killer.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.920
And I'd say the closer those two
get to unmasking them,

29:25.920 --> 29:27.600
the more dangerous it'll get.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.960
Wouldn't you?

29:55.240 --> 29:57.640
Sir. There's someone in the study.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.520
Too late.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.720
Sir.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.400
Off you go, then.

30:53.320 --> 30:57.240
HUGO: I saw someone slip out,
which I thought was suspicious

30:57.240 --> 31:02.840
in this weather, you know,
and at night, so I thought I'd...

31:02.840 --> 31:06.000
Have a go?
Er, lend a hand.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.720
Do you have any idea who it was?

31:09.720 --> 31:13.840
Well, it was so dark,
you know, and the rain.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.720
It was very confusing.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.840
Next time you feel like helping,
Mr Welles, will you do me a favour?

31:18.840 --> 31:22.240
Oh, of course, yes.
Don't.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.240
You know, stopping you from
catching whoever was out here

31:35.240 --> 31:37.160
might've been deliberate.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.080
RADIO: Amber weather warnings
have been issued by the Met Office

31:41.080 --> 31:44.400
as Storm Brenda continues to
lash the country.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.960
Flooding is now a very real
possibility for many communities

31:47.960 --> 31:51.200
and rescue services are working
tirelessly along the banks

31:51.200 --> 31:53.800
of the river and neighbouring towns.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.120
With temperatures set to fall,
snow and blizzard conditions

31:57.120 --> 32:01.520
are forecast within the next few
days and travel chaos may ensue.

32:01.520 --> 32:06.480
The plots, the whodunnit, and how,
I come up with all of them.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.400
I'm guessing you know
a bit about poisons.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.760
Ah, you found one of my clues.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.360
The next murder weapon.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.840
My sergeant did.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.120
Oh, I was gonna be the next victim.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.280
Someone had laced my profiteroles.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.680
How enterprising.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.520
Oh, I'm a stickler for research.

32:22.520 --> 32:25.520
My stories explore the darker
reaches of the human condition,

32:25.520 --> 32:28.320
and it's important to
get the science right.

32:28.320 --> 32:33.240
I've used arsenic,
aconite, hemlock, twice.

32:33.240 --> 32:36.960
I'm a big fan of botulinum,
particularly nasty.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.360
How about cyanide?
Have you ever used that?

32:40.360 --> 32:41.840
That's one of my favourites.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.720
I used it on He Who Slays the Piper.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.760
Murder most foul at
a plumber's convention.

32:53.440 --> 32:58.920
You told my sergeant you'd never met
Victor Karras before yesterday.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.520
No, I always dealt with
Joshua, his assistant.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.320
Then perhaps you can tell me
what the row was about?

33:05.320 --> 33:09.160
I'm...not sure I follow.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.160
You were seen rowing with Victor
just before the party.

33:13.160 --> 33:17.080
I'm wondering what that could have
been about if you'd never met?

33:19.480 --> 33:25.160
OK, 25 years ago,

33:25.160 --> 33:28.160
I...I invented a board game.

33:29.200 --> 33:34.600
A serial killer is loose
in the great London smog of 1952.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
You're a policeman,
can you catch him in time?

33:37.760 --> 33:39.840
Anyway, I sent it to Karras Games.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.880
Naturally, I thought I'd come up
with the next Monopoly.

33:42.880 --> 33:47.000
So what happened?
Well, nothing, of course.

33:48.040 --> 33:52.840
So, I just shrugged
and sort of forgot about it.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.920
Then, a couple of years later,

33:56.920 --> 33:59.480
they announced their brand-new game,

33:59.480 --> 34:02.080
which was my game,

34:02.080 --> 34:04.280
except you were the killer,
not the detective.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.360
You think they stole your idea?

34:06.360 --> 34:08.480
Of course they did.

34:08.480 --> 34:15.240
I tried to sue, but they were
big and powerful and I...I wasn't.

34:15.240 --> 34:18.520
So you dropped the case.
I'm not stupid.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.080
I knew I couldn't win.

34:21.080 --> 34:26.400
I just got on with my life,
tried to pretend it never happened.

34:26.400 --> 34:32.440
So, when Joshua contacted me
about doing a murder mystery,

34:32.440 --> 34:34.760
I couldn't believe it.

34:34.760 --> 34:39.760
Victor Karras, a chance
to confront him face to face.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.440
You think you can just walk
in here demanding money?

34:42.440 --> 34:44.240
I don't want your money.

34:44.240 --> 34:46.240
I want you to apologise.

34:46.240 --> 34:48.000
(GUFFAWS)

34:48.000 --> 34:49.920
Well, he just laughed in my face.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.840
And afterwards?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.800
Well, I went and found the others

34:54.800 --> 34:57.280
and did the first part
of the murder mystery.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.520
Right away?

34:59.840 --> 35:04.360
OK, erm, I was upset.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.240
I needed a moment to myself.
So I went to get a drink.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.080
Where? The hall?
The kitchen.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.440
Can anybody vouch for that?

35:12.440 --> 35:15.360
I don't know. It was very busy.

35:17.760 --> 35:22.440
Your son served Victor
his champagne, I understand.

35:22.440 --> 35:26.520
What, you think I put cyanide
in the champagne

35:26.520 --> 35:28.440
and got Andrew to give
that glass to Victor?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.560
Well, that's absurd.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.920
(DOOR OPENS)

36:03.280 --> 36:06.080
(DRAWER OPENS, RUSTLING)

36:31.520 --> 36:35.680
Consider this, Victor Karras
didn't die when we think he did.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.680
Mr Welles...

36:36.680 --> 36:38.560
He actually died much later,

36:38.560 --> 36:41.360
an elaborate ruse to throw us
off the scent.

36:41.360 --> 36:45.200
So elaborate it involved him also
being impaled by a life-size

36:45.200 --> 36:47.040
figure of Anubis?

36:47.040 --> 36:51.040
Oh, smoke and mirrors. Have you
checked for traces of fake blood?

36:52.440 --> 36:55.400
Alright, they ALL did it.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.600
What?
Not one killer.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.520
Multiple killers.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.360
Each contributing a grain
of cyanide, I suppose.

37:02.360 --> 37:06.000
Ah, yes, well, when
you put it like that.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.880
Erm...
Oh.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.880
Thank you, Mr Welles.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.080
Ah, the room where it happens, eh?

37:14.080 --> 37:15.360
Goodbye, Mr Welles.

37:15.360 --> 37:18.280
I've got plenty more theories,
you know. Very happy to share.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.880
No, no. Please you
keep them to yourself.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.200
Bit rude.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.000
What if they find something?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.040
They won't.
Are you sure?

37:45.320 --> 37:46.680
I took care of it.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.640
Wow.
What do you think?

38:02.640 --> 38:05.920
It's very, erm, analogue.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.760
There's nothing wrong with some good
old-fashioned coppering, Winter.

38:08.760 --> 38:13.760
Back to basics, you know? Logic.
Deduction. The mind, Winter.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.520
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

38:16.520 --> 38:20.000
Any joy with Victor's computer?
A daily anagram.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.240
More games.

38:21.240 --> 38:25.920
Hmm, I took a look at the
financials, but nothing leaps out.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.640
It's like searching
a haystack without knowing

38:27.640 --> 38:30.040
what a needle looks like.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.200
Anyway, back to the salt mines.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.920
Oh, you can rub
that question mark out.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.000
Alicia Matheson was with her
husband the whole time.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.600
Really?

38:39.600 --> 38:41.640
That's what she told me.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.240
Danni Karras says she saw her
on her own just before eight.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.640
Yes. I came upstairs briefly.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.520
You told my sergeant you were
with your husband the whole time.

38:54.480 --> 38:58.880
I'm sorry, I was...
well, I was a bit embarrassed.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.200
Why?

39:01.920 --> 39:04.240
I have eczema. It was playing up.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.480
I...I didn't want it
to ruin the evening,

39:06.480 --> 39:08.600
so I went to get some of this.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.200
I make it myself, with lavender oil.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.840
So you see, Inspector,
it's nothing shady,

39:16.840 --> 39:18.440
I was just a bit yucky.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.400
Very nice.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Your sister told me about the baby.

39:28.120 --> 39:30.720
Isn't she amazing? So generous.

39:30.720 --> 39:36.000
I...we tried everything,
but the IVF wasn't working

39:36.000 --> 39:37.880
and we couldn't...

39:37.880 --> 39:39.520
It's so expensive.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.920
I tried to help, but I work for
a shipping firm.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.680
I enjoy it, but it doesn't pay much.

39:47.920 --> 39:52.080
And, erm, it wasn't just the money,
though, it was...

39:53.880 --> 39:57.720
..it was thinking this time
it'll work, this time...

39:59.080 --> 40:00.640
..and then it...

40:01.960 --> 40:03.760
So your sister stepped in?

40:03.760 --> 40:07.200
And now everything is wonderful.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.520
Thanks to her.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.840
He knows about the game.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.280
And he said Andrew gave
Victor his champagne.

40:29.280 --> 40:33.160
Oh, he's fishing.
Barnaby doesn't know anything.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.720
It's textbook stuff.
He's just trying to smoke you out.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.880
It's spaghetti against the wall.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.680
Which sometimes sticks.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.840
So...

40:41.840 --> 40:46.160
..what if I find the killer?

40:46.160 --> 40:48.760
Wouldn't that prove your innocence?

40:48.760 --> 40:51.120
The police.

40:51.120 --> 40:54.760
They don't seem to
want my help, so...

40:54.760 --> 40:58.480
..why not beat them to it?

40:58.480 --> 41:00.520
Oh!
(LAUGHS)

41:00.520 --> 41:02.080
This is gonna be fun.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.960
(BOTH LAUGH)

41:13.240 --> 41:14.920
(LAUGHS) Bad.

41:16.880 --> 41:20.240
Did Victor Karras know you'd been
stealing from him for months?

41:22.280 --> 41:26.320
There was a routine email
about Victor's household insurance.

41:26.320 --> 41:30.680
On the list there was a designer
watch, high-end, but I couldn't seem

41:30.680 --> 41:34.600
to find any record of it having been
bought on any of his credit cards.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.360
You had access to the business
credit cards, isn't that right?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.800
So?
So I dug a bit deeper.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.440
And I found that there were
no statements for one of his cards

41:44.440 --> 41:45.680
for the last six months.

41:45.680 --> 41:49.400
Someone deleted them from both
your computer and Victor's.

41:49.400 --> 41:53.120
I was able to restore the original
versions of the deleted files.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.280
Clever you.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.400
It was you who broke into the study
last night, wasn't it?

41:57.400 --> 42:00.920
You deleted the files
to cover up your fraud.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.760
That's an ugly word.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.680
You used the card to make
purchases totalling Â£68,000.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.400
What word would you use?

42:09.840 --> 42:13.240
Do you know what it's
like to be taken for granted?

42:13.240 --> 42:16.000
Without me, nothing would've worked.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.560
But Victor didn't care,
or even notice.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.320
So I decided to...

42:21.320 --> 42:23.320
Steal?
Balance the books.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.720
Any idea who sent me this?

42:30.800 --> 42:32.520
I'd start with Paul Matheson

42:32.520 --> 42:34.840
because he'd always blamed me
for Victor firing him.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.280
That I was the reason the tax return
was late and Victor was fined.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.880
It's not true, but it
made him feel better.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.680
Paul always said he'd
get his own back.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.160
What's the betting he has?

42:46.160 --> 42:47.920
PAUL: Yes. Yes, it was me.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.840
And the message on the desk?

42:52.400 --> 42:54.160
You tipped them off?

42:54.160 --> 42:55.920
We'd both worked so hard.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.760
You were in on this?

42:58.760 --> 43:01.240
I was shopping about six weeks ago.

43:02.360 --> 43:05.160
I saw Joshua buying
a watch, a nice one.

43:05.160 --> 43:09.680
I assumed it was for Victor,
but weeks went by and neither Victor

43:09.680 --> 43:14.000
nor El mentioned it
and he certainly wasn't wearing it,

43:14.000 --> 43:15.320
which made me wonder.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.400
So last time I was here,
I had a good look round.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.440
And you found proof?

43:22.440 --> 43:28.880
Receipts, a huge telly,
foreign currency, body care stuff.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.040
The plan was to gather enough
evidence and then tell Victor.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.320
Revenge.
Payback.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.040
Joshua forgot to file the return.

43:37.040 --> 43:41.040
But he lied, covered his backside,
and Victor believed him over me.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.320
Well, this way, Victor
would see the truth.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.680
Only Victor died before
you could do anything.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.320
Erm, will Joshua be charged?

43:52.320 --> 43:53.880
That's up to Mrs Karras.

43:53.880 --> 43:56.920
Oh, he should've known better.

43:59.120 --> 44:02.520
You don't cross Eleanor
and you don't stand in her way.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.960
What my sister wants, Inspector,
my sister usually gets.

44:09.960 --> 44:13.400
DANNI: You know, if he was here
right now, he'd love all of this.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.800
Everyone stuck here.

44:15.800 --> 44:20.040
Secrets, lies,
not knowing who to trust.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.120
One giant game.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.040
When did you become so bitter?

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
He promised me the job.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.760
He didn't think you were ready.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.560
I'm sure you went out of your way
to convince him otherwise.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.360
I am not your enemy, Danni.
I never was.

44:37.680 --> 44:38.760
He loved you.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.320
We both do.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.800
Everything goes to you now,
doesn't it?

44:52.800 --> 44:55.600
The house, controlling shares
in the business.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.720
Everything.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.120
That's right.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.600
Well played.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.680
There's something
I should've told you.

45:09.800 --> 45:14.640
Victor was convinced there was a
leak inside the company, a mole.

45:14.640 --> 45:18.320
He hired somebody to find out.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.760
An investigator?

45:19.760 --> 45:22.440
He didn't tell anyone
else he'd done it.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.920
He didn't know who to trust.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.200
There was a report.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.480
It came back last week.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.000
Proof, he said.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.880
He knew the mole's identity?

45:33.880 --> 45:36.680
I think so.
He didn't tell you?

45:36.680 --> 45:40.440
No, but it was someone close.
I'm sure of it.

45:40.440 --> 45:45.640
After the meeting with
the investigator, he was subdued,

45:45.640 --> 45:48.000
like he'd got bad news.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.480
Where is this report now?

45:50.480 --> 45:54.000
He hid it. It's not in the safe,
I know that much.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.160
He said too many people
knew the combination.

45:57.240 --> 45:59.280
Why didn't you mention this before?

46:01.280 --> 46:05.680
I didn't want to believe it,
that someone so close to us

46:05.680 --> 46:09.760
could betray us and then kill
to protect themselves.

46:09.760 --> 46:11.640
And you think that's what happened?

46:13.600 --> 46:16.520
He was going to reveal
their identity this weekend.

46:18.080 --> 46:21.040
Only he never got the chance.

46:21.040 --> 46:24.520
Did you know about Joshua Kilbride
defrauding Victor Karras?

46:29.520 --> 46:30.880
It was my idea.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.040
After everything Josh had done
for that...

46:36.320 --> 46:39.840
You had every reason to resent
Victor Karras, didn't you?

46:39.840 --> 46:42.240
He also cheated your mother.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.200
Yeah, I didn't know anything about
that. Mum only told me today.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.080
I had no idea.

46:48.840 --> 46:51.480
Believe me, I didn't poison Victor.

46:51.480 --> 46:54.840
And I didn't help my mother to
either. I had no reason.

46:56.000 --> 46:59.400
What about Joshua?
Joshua didn't kill Victor.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.920
We had every reason
to keep him alive.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.720
I'm sorry Victor Karras is dead.

47:06.720 --> 47:10.720
Not because of the way he died,
or the pain it's caused.

47:12.480 --> 47:15.440
I'm sorry because it means
we can't carry on bleeding him.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.440
Bit by little bit.

47:17.440 --> 47:20.200
And for Victor to be too
arrogant and stupid

47:20.200 --> 47:21.960
to even know it's happening.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.320
I loved that we could do that.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.480
It meant we were smarter, stronger.

47:32.480 --> 47:33.760
It meant we'd won.

48:09.840 --> 48:13.120
Andrew Welles said that his mother
never said anything about her link

48:13.120 --> 48:14.920
with Victor Karras.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.400
Go on.

48:16.400 --> 48:19.200
A coincidence like that,
you'd think you'd mention it.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.800
Yes, you might.

48:20.800 --> 48:24.520
So, I'm thinking,
what if it was her idea?

48:24.520 --> 48:26.240
If she wanted to confront Victor,

48:26.240 --> 48:27.720
she could hardly
make an appointment.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.160
The murder mystery
gave her a way in.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.240
But it was Joshua Kilbride
who approached them

48:31.240 --> 48:33.400
because of his relationship
with Andrew.

48:33.400 --> 48:37.760
She couldn't have planned for that.
Hmm, if Andrew's telling the truth.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.720
They're in it together?

48:42.520 --> 48:46.160
If Victor Karras didn't want to
put something in the safe,

48:46.160 --> 48:47.960
where would he hide it?

48:47.960 --> 48:49.840
It depends what it is.

48:49.840 --> 48:52.280
A report that revealed
who had betrayed him.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.080
A secret compartment?
A loose floorboard?

48:57.080 --> 48:58.560
No, it's too obvious.

48:59.840 --> 49:01.760
Everywhere you look, it's games.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.840
Figures in the hall,
board games laid out.

49:03.840 --> 49:06.480
You have to solve an anagram
to get into his computer.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.160
Everything's a game, a puzzle.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.600
And if Victor wanted
to hide something,

49:10.600 --> 49:12.320
it would be in plain sight.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.360
And he'd get a kick knowing
he was the only one that knew

49:14.360 --> 49:15.640
that it was there.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.280
Winter, you're a psychological
genius.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.680
I am?

49:24.240 --> 49:25.640
And only Victor knew how to get in?

49:28.480 --> 49:30.040
Victor liked a puzzle.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.120
So do I?

49:45.880 --> 49:47.360
(WHISPERS) Where have you been?

49:49.040 --> 49:50.520
I think I've found something.

49:52.040 --> 49:54.840
Are you gonna tell the police?
Not yet.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.320
Not till I know more.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.320
No good deed goes unpunished.

50:10.840 --> 50:12.560
That's what they say, isn't it?

50:19.480 --> 50:20.720
Thank you.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.520
El?

50:30.520 --> 50:32.600
I'm fine, I promise.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.120
Don't be daft.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.960
We need you to stay strong.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.560
Healthy for all of us.

50:45.160 --> 50:46.680
Not long now.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.280
This baby...it means the world.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.080
You know that, don't you?

50:57.080 --> 50:59.560
Now who's being daft?

51:04.320 --> 51:07.040
I was never any good at board games.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.560
Too impatient.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.560
I was playing one the other night.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.680
Did you win?

51:13.680 --> 51:15.240
Not so's you'd notice.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.200
Would you give up all this?

51:20.200 --> 51:24.520
You know, for something
cushy behind a desk?

51:24.520 --> 51:27.640
Are you kidding? Why, would you?

51:27.640 --> 51:30.000
WOMAN: (CRIES OUT) Help!

51:33.000 --> 51:34.960
Alicia!
Alicia!

51:36.680 --> 51:38.800
She just collapsed.
She can't breathe.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.840
Teacup smells of almonds.

51:42.840 --> 51:44.640
Cyanide?
There must be something we can do.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.240
B12. That's what she needs.

51:48.680 --> 51:51.400
Your injection kit,
in your room. Now.

51:57.320 --> 52:00.880
I don't understand. Why would
anyone want to poison Alicia?

52:04.760 --> 52:07.560
Cui bono.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.960
Sorry?

52:08.960 --> 52:10.760
It's Latin.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.560
Who gains?

52:12.560 --> 52:17.560
Or rather, who benefits
from attacking Victor Karras

52:17.560 --> 52:20.480
and Alicia Matheson?

52:20.480 --> 52:22.120
Is this a trick question?

52:22.120 --> 52:23.760
You really think it's one of us?

52:23.760 --> 52:25.320
That's ridiculous.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.240
Evidence to the contrary.

52:27.240 --> 52:30.480
I hate this.
Not so much fun when it's real, eh?

52:32.280 --> 52:34.280
Why are you so hostile?

52:35.360 --> 52:38.000
Something to hide, maybe?

52:38.000 --> 52:39.400
I've got work to do.

52:41.320 --> 52:45.320
But ask yourself,
why can't it be Poirot over there?

52:45.320 --> 52:48.920
How come he gets to ask
all the questions, hmm?

52:48.920 --> 52:51.400
What do any of us know about him?

52:53.040 --> 52:54.440
Textbook deflection.

52:55.880 --> 52:56.880
Interesting.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.280
God, you're an idiot.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.160
She's breathing better.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.240
The B12 injection
seems to have worked.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.960
We believe the poison
was either already in the cup

53:08.960 --> 53:11.840
or added soon afterwards.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.680
But Eleanor poured my tea.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.880
Well, she poured everyone's.

53:15.880 --> 53:17.200
Did she?

53:18.640 --> 53:20.440
You don't think?

53:20.440 --> 53:23.360
I don't... No, that
doesn't make any sense.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.880
Not Eleanor.

53:30.480 --> 53:31.840
Joshua.

53:35.480 --> 53:37.040
They told you.

53:39.320 --> 53:40.880
A petty thief.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.640
How, could you?

53:43.640 --> 53:46.440
Maybe if you and Victor had treated
me better, I wouldn't have had to.

53:46.440 --> 53:49.280
We treated you like family.
No, no.

53:50.400 --> 53:54.080
That's just the lie you tell
yourself to make you feel better.

53:54.080 --> 53:57.560
When this is over, pack your things.
I want you gone.

53:57.560 --> 54:00.240
What, no verbal warning?

54:01.240 --> 54:03.080
Get out of my sight.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.800
This means something.

54:27.360 --> 54:28.720
But I can't...

54:30.640 --> 54:34.160
It's, like, out of reach.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.720
If I can just...

54:37.240 --> 54:38.920
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

It's a lot harder in real life.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.840
(LAUGHS)

54:46.480 --> 54:51.520
We know Alicia Matheson
was alone at about 7:50

54:51.520 --> 54:55.080
because she went
to get the cream for her arm.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.720
So, what if she saw something?

54:58.880 --> 55:01.360
She'd have told us.

55:01.360 --> 55:05.520
Unless she didn't realise
the significance of what she saw.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.320
Or she was scared of it.

55:08.320 --> 55:12.840
What if she saw something
or someone

55:12.840 --> 55:15.360
who she didn't want to
believe was guilty?

55:15.360 --> 55:17.360
Like the sister who's
carrying her baby.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.960
Unless he changed his will,
then yes, Inspector,

55:21.960 --> 55:24.640
my husband left everything to me -
it's not unusual.

55:24.640 --> 55:27.200
But it is a motive.
Money always is.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.200
Only if you want it and I don't.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.600
I want my husband back.

55:30.600 --> 55:34.360
Have you any idea how the poison
got into your sister's tea?

55:34.360 --> 55:35.760
None.

55:35.760 --> 55:38.000
A room full of people,
no-one saw a thing,

55:38.000 --> 55:40.880
other than you handing out the cups.

55:40.880 --> 55:43.800
Are you really suggesting
I poisoned my own sister?

55:43.800 --> 55:46.760
The same sister I'm carrying
a baby for, that sister?

55:46.760 --> 55:49.600
Perhaps you changed your mind.
Decided you wanted to keep the baby.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.200
A, that's ridiculous.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.080
B, there is no
legally binding contract

55:53.080 --> 55:54.400
for surrogates in this country.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.960
I am the legal parent. If I wanted
to keep the baby, I could.

55:59.160 --> 56:02.520
I love my sister.
It is about time she was happy.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.520
I'm giving her life, Inspector.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.600
Why on earth would I
want to take it away?

56:13.440 --> 56:14.760
Hugo.

56:14.760 --> 56:17.160
He came to see how I was.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.040
That's kind.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.800
Erm, I should go.

56:21.800 --> 56:24.280
Leave you to rest. Thank you.

56:28.640 --> 56:30.520
I made you this.

56:30.520 --> 56:33.080
It's from a can,
so it's perfectly...

56:35.560 --> 56:39.560
Sorry...I just thought
I was going to lose you.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.680
Hush.

56:44.560 --> 56:46.640
What if whoever it was tries again?

Well, then I've got
you to look after me,

That's right.

It's from a game, Hounds and Jackals.

Pretty apt, I'd say.

His wife said that she last
saw him at 11:30 last night

So why did he come down here?

I want to know where everyone
was between then and this morning.

What do we do with him?
We can't move him.

..this morning.

when it was ripped off,

of cracking the case.

Another game?
It's catching.

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:54.120
Hugo gave this to me.

1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:57.200
He found it outside
in the grass by the river.

1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:01.640
You didn't tell me about this, Mum.

1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:04.400
Erm, your father asked me
not to tell anyone.

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:07.360
Hugo thought it had something to do
with what was thrown into the river

1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:09.320
the night before last?

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:11.320
He just wasn't sure what.

1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:13.840
And then...we were
sitting on the stairs

1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:17.560
and suddenly he leapt to his feet.

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:19.680
He was buzzing.

1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:22.680
He gave it to me to look after.

1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:25.080
He said it was really important.

1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:28.560
Said he knew how
Victor was poisoned.

1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:32.160
He was so excited.

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:35.080
He just needed the last
piece of the jigsaw.

1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:38.640
Oh...

1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:43.440
..I wish he'd never started.

1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:48.360
She, erm...she needs to rest.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:56.760
He wanted to wait, you know,

1:02:56.760 --> 1:02:58.720
until everyone was assembled.

1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.440

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:20.480

parlour game.

I'm sure you'll think of a way.
It's ridiculous.

You could always try shouting at it

None of us do.

1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:55.600
I don't want to be with you.

I'm moving out.

But I am sick of you
taking it out on me.

Find someone else to kick, Danni.
I'm done.

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.600
So he'd worked out how
Victor was poisoned?

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:17.160
Apparently.

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:19.440
And it has something
to do with this?

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:23.920
Well, it'd help if
I knew what it was.

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:28.520
So one minute he didn't know
and the next minute he did?

1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:31.000
Did everything but shout eureka.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000

1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:25.280
What about it?

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:28.880
Eleanor Karras told us
that Victor wanted to vape

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:30.320
just before the party.

1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:32.800
She made him put it away.
Yeah, that's right.

1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:35.840
So where is it? It was last seen
in the dressing-room.

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:37.480
But it's not there.

1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:42.240
I think that this
is a part of the kit.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:46.840
I think that's what the killer
threw into the river.

1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:47.920
But why?

1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:50.840
Because that's how
Victor Karras was poisoned.

1:05:50.840 --> 1:05:54.240
He didn't drink cyanide or eat it,
he inhaled it.

1:05:54.240 --> 1:05:55.240
But...

1:05:55.240 --> 1:05:59.280
I know the last time
he vaped was in the morning.

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:03.480

Yeah, well, I take it out,

1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:18.200

away your own money,

you wanted his instead.

didn't hurt, right?

found out it was you.

I could've explained.

It wasn't about him, or us.

everything after the party.

1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:28.360
And you think I killed him
to stop that from happening?

about the investigator
or the report.

would've been the point?

There was only one person
who I never wanted to find out.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.760
And he's the only one who knew.

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.160
What happened there?

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:56.600
A disagreement.

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:01.440
Quite a jigsaw.

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:10.960
You repaired this
with stuff thrown out

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:13.160

the bins outside. Why?

The river's definitely
going down, sir.

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.640

a boat across later,

to the mainland.

OK, let's keep that
to ourselves for now.

In the meantime, see
if you can find out what,

1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:36.000
erm, NitRile means, if anything?

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.760
But how? There's no internet.

1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:42.240
Once upon a time,
we had things called books.

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:46.800
They can be quite useful.
That room's full of them.

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.360
See what you can find.

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:42.240
Ah.

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:49.400
Acetonitrile, it's a compound
containing carbon and nitrogen.

1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:50.400
Is it a poison?

1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.120
Yes. But here's the thing,
it takes 12 hours to work.

1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:56.440
12 hours?
Yeah, in that time, it metabolises.

1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:00.640
It changes into something else.
Slow-acting Cyanide.

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:14.560
So, the murderer replaces
the cartridge from the vape kit

1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:16.120
with the poisoned one.

1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:22.880
Then gets rid of the empty ampoule,

1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:26.680
assuming it will get lost
in the rest of the rubbish.

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:29.280
They have a perfect alibi.

1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.000
They can be wherever they want to be,

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.840
with whoever they like,
when Victor dies.

1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:41.360
There's just one loose end.

1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:43.320
The vape kit itself.

1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:47.600
And they have to retrieve that
because if we get hold of it,

1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:50.400
we'll find traces of acetonitrile.

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.360
Not a problem.

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:56.480
After all, they've got
12 hours to do it.

1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:59.320
Then all they have to do
is wait until dark

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.440
and then throw it in the river.

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:03.600
Fool-proof.

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:08.680
They didn't count on Noah Adomakoh
going through the bins,

1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:14.120
getting raw materials to prove
kintsugi is the next big thing.

1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:19.120
So that's the how.

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:23.840

1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.040
We just have to prove it.

go home within the hour.

of the crimes,

to get us out of the room

I didn't poison anybody.

1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:54.840
I've never heard
of this aceto stuff.

1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:58.240
So what if I had a little
bit of vape kit?

1:17:58.240 --> 1:17:59.560
It's just coincidence.

1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:01.560
Who said anything about a vape kit?

1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:05.640
How could she be the killer?
She's one of the victims.

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:08.480
That's what you wanted us
to believe, isn't it?

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.800
That and the fact that your
sister was the murderer.

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.760
You poisoned your own teacup.

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:19.800
I'm guessing with a very small
amount of the prussic acid

1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:21.480
from the kitchen.

1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:23.760
Do you know how absurd that sounds?

1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:28.640
It was a risk, but you were
never in any real danger.

1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.160
As you knew that your
husband had the antidote.

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:37.160
Unfortunately, for you,
despite your best efforts,

1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:42.560
there still wasn't enough
to arrest Eleanor.

1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:46.440
But then Hugo Welles started
to get close to the truth,

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:49.280
and he presented
a golden opportunity.

1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:52.920
So you lured him to the dining room
where you stabbed him

1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:54.840
and left Eleanor's charm
at the scene.

1:18:54.840 --> 1:18:56.280
Then why aren't you
saying all this to her?

1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:57.840
She's obviously the killer, not me.

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:00.720
Do you want to put
some cream on that?

1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.680
It must be uncomfortable.
No, I'm fine.

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:05.280
It's, erm...

1:19:06.440 --> 1:19:09.080
..lavender oil you use, right?

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:10.720
What's that got to do with anything?

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:16.800
It was Eleanor's charm
that was bothering me.

1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:19.920
Why would she wear it
in the middle of the night?

1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:23.840
If Hugo tore it off her
in the struggle,

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:27.320
then why wasn't there
a mark on her neck?

1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:34.600
I began to wonder if
the charm had been planted.

1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:36.680
So I looked a bit closer,

1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:40.440
which was when I knew
it was you who had done it.

1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:42.360
Really, Sherlock?

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.040
And how did you do that?

1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:47.480
I could smell the lavender.

1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:55.200
When we get everything back
to the labs, we'll find evidence

1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:58.960
of acetonitrile on the vape kit

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:03.360
and traces of the skin cream
you make.

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:06.600
And that's before we examine
Hugo's body

1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:10.120
and take your clothes to be tested.

1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:13.160
Stabbing someone like that,

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:17.160
you'd be amazed at the traces
it leaves behind.

1:20:19.080 --> 1:20:20.800
Game's over.

1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:25.720
Alicia...tell me it's not true.

1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:31.080
You killed my Hugo?

1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:37.120
He came to see me.

1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:41.160
He thought Joshua was the murderer.

1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:44.280
It's Joshua.

1:20:44.280 --> 1:20:46.720
He'd worked out that
Victor's vape was poisoned,

1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:48.920
which Joshua had easy access to.

1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:53.320
He'd seen Eleanor sack Joshua,

1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:55.520
so he knew all about him
stealing from Victor.

1:20:57.480 --> 1:21:00.880
And he'd seen that Joshua had
the opportunity to poison me at tea.

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.040
Hugo?

1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:07.160
I told him I had something important
I needed to tell him.

1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:08.560
But I can't do it here.

1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:10.040
That I'd meet him later.

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.040
Yes.

1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:16.840
Silly man, blundering around,
getting so much wrong.

1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:19.040
He got the vape kit right.

1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:21.760
Quicker than I did.
Yes.

1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:23.320
Yes, he got that right.

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:26.680
But what if he realised his mistake

1:21:26.680 --> 1:21:28.320
and somehow he could put
the pieces together?

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:31.000
I...I couldn't take that risk.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.360
I'm sorry. I...I am.

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:35.360
But I...I had no choice.

1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:38.520
I want to know why.

1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:41.720
You have to ask?

1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:43.200
I need to know.

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:45.880
I found out, OK?

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:48.720
I know what you were going to do.

1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.680
What are you talking about?

1:21:51.680 --> 1:21:54.320
I know you were going
to take my baby.

1:21:57.320 --> 1:21:59.400
I found the estimate
for the nursery.

1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:01.320
The new nursery that
you were going to build.

1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.600
You were going to take my baby away.

1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:04.720
That's not what we were...

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:08.760
No, at first I couldn't believe it,
but then I heard you with Victor.

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:10.480
If you're happy, I'm happy.

1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:12.200
Do it. We can't hang around.

1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:16.280
For God's sake, don't
say anything to Alicia.

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:19.920
If she finds out early,
it'll ruin everything.

1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:22.440
It's my baby.

1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:23.960
Mine!

1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:25.640
And I couldn't let you do that.

1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:29.160
So you killed Victor.

1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:31.240
Well, I couldn't harm you,
not with the baby,

1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:33.840
but if you were found
guilty of his murder...

1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:35.720
The baby would be given to you.

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:39.000
We had waited so long.

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:42.600
And I couldn't just sit by
while you got your way again,

1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:43.960
like you always do.

1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:48.040
Don't you see? I did it for us.

1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:50.640
For our family.

1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:54.520
You got it all wrong.

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:57.040
I don't think so.

1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:01.400
The estimate, what you heard...

1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:05.160
..we weren't gonna build
a nursery here.

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:07.320
I know you're lying. I heard you.

1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:09.080
Not all of it.

1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:14.240
If she finds out early,
it'll ruin everything.

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:19.880
Well, we, don't want to spoil
the surprise, do we?

1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:22.360
You are a good man, my love.

1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:24.320
She's gonna be so happy.

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.720
No, that's, erm...
that's not possible.

1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:36.760
I was never going to keep the baby.

1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:40.960
It was always going to be yours.

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.560
The child you deserved.

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:50.960
What have I done?

1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:01.960
When we get back,
get onto the shipping firm

1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:04.520
Alicia Matheson works for.

1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:07.880
I'm guessing somewhere there's
a shipment of acetonitrile

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:09.160
that went missing.

1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:16.760
She has a certain majestic quality,
don't you think?

1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:23.320
Good murder mystery weekend?

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:24.640
It had its moments.

1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:28.280
It wasn't cyanide.
I ran some tests, it was...

1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:31.480
Acetonitrile, I know.
Very good.

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:34.400
How did you find out?

1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:38.280
It was handed to me on a platter.

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:52.120
Happy families.

1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.240
Which ironically is all
Alicia Matheson wanted.

1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:58.640
On the whole, I wish she'd
stuck to Mr Bun the Baker.

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:02.720
Listen, Eleanor, I'm...
No.

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:07.760
Noah?

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.000
Are you coming, sir?

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.280
I'll catch you up.

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:18.240
Mrs Karras?

1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:20.920
Inspector.

1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:25.520
I'm very sorry about
what happened to your husband.

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:26.720
Thank you.

1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:31.800
I've decided to keep the baby.

1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:38.080
Something good to come out
of all this, you know?

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:40.120
I know.

1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:44.000
It sounds strange to say thank you,

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.960
but if there's anything I can do.

1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:52.640
Actually, erm, there is something.

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.880
The Karras family had the game.

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:03.840
Eleanor Karras didn't
think they'd miss it.

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.600
I'm sorry. Betty behaves
better than I did.

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:11.960
It was a little extreme.

1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:15.360
And you were right.

1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:20.520
It wasn't about the missing piece.

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:26.200
I've been offered a promotion.

1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:28.400
It's more money, better hours.

1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:33.160
I can certainly see why that
would have put you in a foul mood.

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:38.720
And the other night, I knew what
I should do for you, for Betty.

1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:41.960
It's a great opportunity.

1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:46.920
And?

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:51.960
And I'll be behind a desk
with a nice rubber plant

1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:56.840
and lots of paper and
I won't solve anything again.

1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:01.440
That's why I was
a little bit tetchy.

1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:04.280
I'm sorry.

1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:08.080
When do they need an answer?
Tomorrow.

1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:09.880
What will you tell them?

1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:11.320
I wasn't sure.

1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:14.280
And then this last couple of days...

1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:20.680
..that moment when it all...
when you....

1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:25.760
Let someone else
have the rubber plant.

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:27.680
Are you sure?

1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:29.160
Yeah.

1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:33.480
Fancy a game?

1:27:34.840 --> 1:27:36.720
It's a bit of a faff
to set up, isn't it?

1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:38.720
Besides, it's not much
of a game for two players.

1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:44.000
Yeah, that's...
that's not what I meant.

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:51.840
But first I'd like you to do
something special, just for me.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.760
Name it.

1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.240
Have a bath.

1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.720
Bring your wine.

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:12.200
(DOG YAPS)

1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:13.880
No, Paddy.
