00:38.442 --> 00:39.608
Tedjo's slippery.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.610
He's small, but don't
underestimate him.

00:41.612 --> 00:43.444
- Just follow my lead, kiddo.
- Okay.

00:43.446 --> 00:44.914
- Sir.
- Yes, please.

00:44.916 --> 00:48.050
Hello. Need to get up
to the penthouse please.

00:48.052 --> 00:50.953
I'll let Mr. Washington
know that you're here.

00:50.955 --> 00:53.622
It's best
if we surprise Mr. Washington.

00:53.624 --> 00:55.827
Yeah. I think
that'd be best.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.861
Thank you.

00:58.863 --> 01:00.362
"Mr. Washington"?

01:00.364 --> 01:02.665
Why would Tedjo stay here
and not a safehouse?

01:02.667 --> 01:05.235
Better not be
a bad friggin' tip.

01:05.236 --> 01:06.603
"Friggin'"?

01:07.504 --> 01:08.938
Daughter thinks
I swear too much.

01:10.007 --> 01:12.242
Is Nicole still dating
that guy?

01:12.244 --> 01:14.643
Yeah. Mathis.

01:14.645 --> 01:17.379
Smells like a candle.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.448
God, I hope
they're not having sex.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.017
Oh, don't worry about it,
she's Catholic.

01:22.019 --> 01:23.652
Probably just a bit of anal.

01:23.654 --> 01:25.956
Morris.

01:27.059 --> 01:28.126
Get down!

01:31.062 --> 01:32.063
What the...

01:42.540 --> 01:43.908
Clear.

01:49.882 --> 01:51.047
Morris! You okay?

01:58.323 --> 01:59.523
Tedjo.

02:07.398 --> 02:08.633
Shit!

02:11.435 --> 02:12.638
Fucker!

02:21.612 --> 02:24.149
Oh. Oh, Jesus!

02:52.779 --> 02:55.145
Two, three,
four, five, six!

03:06.058 --> 03:07.425
You little shit!

03:26.212 --> 03:27.545
Vic, you good?

03:27.547 --> 03:28.815
- That's Tedjo.
- Come on.

03:35.455 --> 03:36.655
I don't see him!

03:37.623 --> 03:38.889
Where'd he go?

03:38.891 --> 03:40.891
Hey!

03:40.893 --> 03:41.992
I got him!

03:45.898 --> 03:46.933
We gotta move!

03:47.266 --> 03:48.267
Oh, shit!

04:04.184 --> 04:05.185
Yes!

04:07.186 --> 04:10.187
Is he there? Morris?

04:10.189 --> 04:12.323
<i>Just got down here!
I don't see...</i>

04:12.325 --> 04:13.425
- <i>Vic! Help!</i>
- Shit!

04:13.427 --> 04:15.960
<i>Help, help! Vic, help!</i>

04:15.962 --> 04:17.997
Morris!

04:30.143 --> 04:31.144
Stop!

04:32.145 --> 04:33.312
Come on!

04:35.581 --> 04:36.816
Move!

04:43.423 --> 04:44.624
Morris!

04:47.528 --> 04:49.595
Hey! Yo, man!
What's up?

04:50.497 --> 04:51.797
- Stop!
- Watch out!

04:51.799 --> 04:53.100
Stop and turn around!

04:56.403 --> 04:58.270
Hands up! Now!

04:58.272 --> 04:59.870
Slowly! Don't move!

05:01.308 --> 05:02.474
Morris!

05:05.612 --> 05:06.879
Morris!

05:08.714 --> 05:10.084
Morris!

05:18.392 --> 05:19.692
Morris!

05:24.932 --> 05:26.233
Shit.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.867
Tell me you're good.
Morris?

05:29.869 --> 05:31.804
Come on, kid,
talk to me.

05:32.573 --> 05:34.973
Stay with me, kiddo.
Come on.

05:34.975 --> 05:36.274
Oh, God damn it!

05:38.145 --> 05:39.345
I need backup.

05:39.347 --> 05:40.546
We need medical support

05:40.548 --> 05:42.746
at the west entrance
to the Staples Center.

05:42.748 --> 05:44.583
You're good. Hey.

05:44.585 --> 05:46.084
Morris?

05:46.086 --> 05:47.252
Morris?

05:47.254 --> 05:48.622
Morris!

05:49.089 --> 05:50.624
Help!

05:55.762 --> 05:58.897
<i>It's 5:00,
Los Angeles. Quittin' time!</i>

05:58.899 --> 06:00.732
<i>Get home, jump in the pool,
have a cold one.</i>

06:00.734 --> 06:02.134
<i>Because this heat wave
is still working.</i>

06:02.136 --> 06:05.037
<i>103 degrees at the beaches,
112 in the Valley.</i>

06:05.039 --> 06:06.271
<i>Let's do it!</i>

06:06.273 --> 06:09.174
<i>It's hot as hell, people,
and the traffic is a demon.</i>

06:09.176 --> 06:11.710
<i>405 is backed up
from the 10 to Sunset.</i>

06:11.712 --> 06:13.078
<i>Two lanes closed on the...</i>

06:13.080 --> 06:14.715
Oh.

06:22.222 --> 06:24.390
Oh, shit! Again?

06:24.392 --> 06:25.826
Stu!

06:29.364 --> 06:31.196
Stuber.

06:31.198 --> 06:32.365
You didn't cancel.

06:32.367 --> 06:33.466
It affects my rating.

06:33.468 --> 06:36.435
I can't drop below four stars
or I lose this job.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.805
Ooh. New ride?
A little eco-puss for me but not bad.

06:39.807 --> 06:41.107
How'd you
afford this, Stuber?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.308
It's a lease, and you can
stop calling me Stuber.

06:43.310 --> 06:45.744
Oh, come on. You know
I gotta be tough with you.

06:45.746 --> 06:46.978
I can't show favoritism

06:46.980 --> 06:48.581
in front of
my other employees.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.982
You told Ashley in kayaks

06:49.984 --> 06:51.951
that I lost my penis
in the Gulf War.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.853
I did that.
Come on, man.

06:54.855 --> 06:57.557
The point is,
I see potential in you, Stu.

06:57.559 --> 06:59.894
Just type in
your destination.

07:02.697 --> 07:04.697
- I'm not going to Bosley.
- But...

07:04.699 --> 07:06.432
I'm banging a chick
that works there.

07:06.434 --> 07:08.733
- Is her name Propecia?
- Huh?

07:08.735 --> 07:10.769
- Hmm?
- All right.

07:10.771 --> 07:13.139
Give me some of them
Coffee Crisps, son.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.807
I need the full
Stuber experience

07:14.809 --> 07:16.378
or you're getting
one star again. Whoo!

07:18.845 --> 07:21.216
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.991
Okay, this is
gonna sound complicated.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.993
But what I need you to do
is take Alta Loma,

07:33.995 --> 07:35.596
down to North Croft Street.

07:35.598 --> 07:37.196
- Five cheeseburgers.
- Five cheeseburgers.

07:37.198 --> 07:38.764
- <i>Five cheeseburgers.</i>
- No onions, no pickles.

07:38.766 --> 07:40.967
- <i>Did you say five cheeseburgers?</i>
- No onions! No pickles!

07:40.969 --> 07:43.135
- You're not gonna eat this in the car, right?
- Oh, no.

07:43.137 --> 07:44.671
- Down at the bar.
- How come he uses...

07:44.673 --> 07:46.205
I have four voicemails
from him.

07:46.207 --> 07:48.007
...four heart emojis?
Every time he texts me...

07:48.009 --> 07:50.943
Harry's parents died
and was killed by Voldemort.

07:50.945 --> 07:52.512
I just hate fish.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.046
Now, a lot of
people think...

07:54.048 --> 07:55.848
Can't you see
I'm in pain here?

07:55.850 --> 07:56.916
Could you at least
drive the speed limit?

07:56.918 --> 07:58.351
<i>Watch out!</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:02.489
That's on you, bro.

08:02.491 --> 08:03.823
No! No!

08:03.825 --> 08:05.027
No, go out the window!

08:10.299 --> 08:11.565
"Massive eyebrows?"

08:11.567 --> 08:12.834
Ugh.

08:24.313 --> 08:26.315
Byron Jade.

08:28.618 --> 08:30.084
Shit.

08:57.313 --> 08:58.945
- Happy birthday, Kramer.
- Yo, Vic.

08:58.947 --> 09:00.981
- I appreciate it.
- McHENRY: It's Kramer's 50th.

09:00.983 --> 09:02.916
I brought you the world's
tiniest piece of cake.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.385
I didn't get cake
on my birthday.

09:04.387 --> 09:06.219
What're you doin' here?

09:06.221 --> 09:08.121
Like a dog on a bone,
you, huh?

09:08.123 --> 09:09.491
Tedjo's a cop killer.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.225
He's still trafficking
through LA.

09:12.227 --> 09:14.261
He'll make a mistake.
I'll get him.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.029
Look, I don't know
how to tell you this...

09:16.031 --> 09:17.497
but you're out of time.

09:17.499 --> 09:19.766
The chief is kicking Tedjo
up to the feds.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.034
Bullshit!

09:21.036 --> 09:22.670
I've been working on
this case for two years!

09:22.672 --> 09:24.037
Look, we don't have
any choice.

09:24.039 --> 09:25.272
It's their case now.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.042
Feds didn't make promises
to Morris's family.

09:28.044 --> 09:29.976
Maybe you shouldn't
have either.

09:29.978 --> 09:32.245
Losing a partner
can sideswipe you.

09:32.247 --> 09:34.981
You're blaming yourself,
but it's not your fault.

09:34.983 --> 09:36.149
Look, when was
the last time

09:36.151 --> 09:38.152
you took a few days off?
Some PTO.

09:38.154 --> 09:40.254
Spend some time with Nikki.

09:40.256 --> 09:41.355
Yeah, I'm gonna
see her tomorrow.

09:41.357 --> 09:43.256
She's driving me
to a doctor's appointment.

09:43.258 --> 09:44.424
Are you okay?

09:44.426 --> 09:47.528
Yeah. Just old, blind.

09:47.530 --> 09:49.062
Getting
Lasik surgery tomorrow.

09:49.064 --> 09:51.899
Okay. Spend some time with
your beautiful daughter.

09:51.901 --> 09:54.201
You'll come back
a new man.

09:54.203 --> 09:55.068
Yeah.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.340
I'm sorry.
Truly am, Vic.

10:08.551 --> 10:10.984
Big lease.
This is it, huh?

10:10.986 --> 10:12.653
Yep.
I have signed my half.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.422
Once you sign yours,
it is official.

10:14.424 --> 10:17.058
I'd have to move some funds
around, but, you know...

10:17.060 --> 10:20.129
Check out
my photoshop skills.

10:21.264 --> 10:25.066
Oh, wow. That's awesome.
That is beautiful.

10:25.068 --> 10:26.536
- Oh, thank you.
- Wow.

10:27.337 --> 10:29.302
Wow! Byron Jade!

10:29.304 --> 10:32.874
Oh, yes! He's gonna be
our celebrity endorsement.

10:32.876 --> 10:35.645
It's amazing, right?

10:36.546 --> 10:37.912
I just was...

10:37.914 --> 10:39.882
Because you had said
that we couldn't

10:39.884 --> 10:41.115
mention me on the pamphlet...

10:41.117 --> 10:43.751
because it's
a women-only gym...

10:43.753 --> 10:45.888
and then your man friend
Byron Jade...

10:45.890 --> 10:47.823
much more of a man
than I am.

10:47.825 --> 10:49.157
Oh, Stu, no, no, no!

10:49.159 --> 10:52.093
No, this is just about
getting butts on bikes.

10:52.095 --> 10:53.994
Sign it, sign it,
sign it.

10:53.996 --> 10:56.199
Okay!

10:57.802 --> 10:59.500
No regrets.

10:59.502 --> 11:01.235
Stu, oh, I'm gonna cry.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.004
We're gonna be
small-business owners.

11:03.006 --> 11:05.140
Actually, I prefer
business operator.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.909
'Cause it reminds me
of the Sade song

11:06.911 --> 11:08.378
and that is empowering
to me, so...

11:13.717 --> 11:15.049
Mmm.

11:15.051 --> 11:16.218
- We're doing it!
- Yes!

11:16.220 --> 11:17.385
Becca,
I like your shoes.

11:17.387 --> 11:18.653
They don't really go
with your outfit...

11:18.655 --> 11:20.722
but, uh,
you can pull it off.

11:20.724 --> 11:21.924
Oh, Richie,
thank you.

11:21.926 --> 11:23.257
I like your facial hair.

11:23.259 --> 11:24.760
Although, am I your type?

11:24.762 --> 11:26.228
'Cause I'm over 12.

11:26.230 --> 11:28.130
- What?
- I'm gonna go...

11:28.132 --> 11:29.231
'cause when you entered,

11:29.233 --> 11:30.531
my tailbone was like,
"We're unsafe!"

11:30.533 --> 11:31.600
Will you call me later?

11:31.602 --> 11:32.668
- Yeah.
- All right.

11:32.670 --> 11:33.769
Bye!

11:33.771 --> 11:34.837
I'm excited!

11:34.839 --> 11:35.970
She was making a joke.

11:35.972 --> 11:38.240
I don't like
when girls make jokes.

11:38.242 --> 11:39.809
Hey, um, can I pick up
some more shifts?

11:39.811 --> 11:41.143
I need some more cash
coming in.

11:41.145 --> 11:42.977
Not in this economy.
Cool?

11:42.979 --> 11:44.413
Sure.

11:44.415 --> 11:45.914
Also, not really
an appropriate question

11:45.916 --> 11:47.282
to ask your boss.

11:47.284 --> 11:49.520
Yeah. You think
Becca would fuck me?

11:49.820 --> 11:51.388
I don't.

11:56.293 --> 11:57.559
The blurriness
should dissipate

11:57.561 --> 11:59.228
in the next 24 hours,
give or take.

11:59.230 --> 12:01.430
Rest, no driving,
avoid stress...

12:01.432 --> 12:03.666
increased heart rate,
sunlight, heat, dust.

12:03.668 --> 12:05.703
You might experience
some dizziness, headache.

12:10.474 --> 12:12.107
All right.

12:12.109 --> 12:13.910
Looking good.

12:13.912 --> 12:15.312
Keep these on
the rest of the day.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.047
Okay.

12:19.517 --> 12:21.550
How long before
I can see straight, doc?

12:21.552 --> 12:23.151
When you can read
the bottom line,

12:23.153 --> 12:24.622
you're good to go.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.359
God, it's bright.

12:30.361 --> 12:32.563
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm coming, Dad.

12:33.364 --> 12:34.797
- You good?
- Yeah.

12:34.799 --> 12:36.164
All right.
Watch your step.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.236
Man, that jackass screwed up my eyes.
I can't see shit.

12:40.572 --> 12:42.871
So, um,
I know it's only August...

12:42.873 --> 12:44.874
but I think
I'm gonna do Christmas

12:44.876 --> 12:46.408
with Mom and David
this year.

12:46.410 --> 12:48.410
What about
eating here?

12:48.412 --> 12:50.013
- It's our Christmas tradition.
- No.

12:50.015 --> 12:51.281
This is not our tradition.

12:51.283 --> 12:53.415
This is your tradition.
I hate coming here.

12:53.417 --> 12:54.918
Hey, Howard Wu
is good people.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.853
And I like the food anyway,
it's good.

12:56.855 --> 12:58.387
So, um, guess your eyes are

12:58.389 --> 12:59.724
too banged up
to make it tonight?

13:01.626 --> 13:03.361
Tonight! Abbot Kinney.

13:04.195 --> 13:05.627
Oh. Of course.

13:05.629 --> 13:08.397
Yeah, no, I was just
thinking about that earlier.

13:08.399 --> 13:10.567
You think I'd miss my baby
girl's first gallery show?

13:10.569 --> 13:12.735
Well, you did schedule
eye surgery

13:12.737 --> 13:14.237
the same day as it, so...

13:14.239 --> 13:15.338
Well, even if I was having

13:15.340 --> 13:17.106
a heart transplant today,
I'd be there.

13:17.108 --> 13:20.142
Right. But you can't
actually see, so...

13:20.144 --> 13:21.813
I'll get up
real close then.

13:22.981 --> 13:24.948
Don't do that.

13:24.950 --> 13:26.516
Don't do that
where you breathe like that.

13:26.518 --> 13:27.717
I'll be there.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.351
Just pick me up on your way.

13:29.353 --> 13:31.988
Oh. Sure, yeah, I'll drive
two hours out of my way,

13:31.990 --> 13:33.323
in traffic,
during a heatwave...

13:33.325 --> 13:35.024
to pick you up.
Instead of...

13:35.026 --> 13:36.159
I don't know,
getting ready for maybe

13:36.161 --> 13:37.560
the biggest night
of my career.

13:37.562 --> 13:38.561
Give me your phone.

13:38.563 --> 13:40.030
Come on, come on!
Give me your phone.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.531
If you're really serious
about coming...

13:41.533 --> 13:44.334
then I'm gonna make it as
easy on you as possible.

13:44.336 --> 13:45.468
Okay.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.870
This is Uber.

13:47.872 --> 13:49.372
- Yes, I know what Uber is.
- Okay.

13:49.374 --> 13:51.441
Then you know how to get to
your daughter's art show...

13:51.443 --> 13:53.175
that you definitely
remembered was tonight.

13:53.177 --> 13:55.411
Okay, you're gonna need
a password, so...

13:55.413 --> 13:57.313
- My birthday, how about that?
- Your birthday.

13:57.315 --> 13:58.815
That's a good test.

13:58.817 --> 14:00.718
Okay. Do you have any good selfies?
You're gonna need a picture.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.785
I don't know.

14:01.787 --> 14:04.253
Wow.
Cool pics, Dad.

14:04.255 --> 14:06.524
Okay, look at me.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.195
Great.
Here you go.

14:11.196 --> 14:12.896
- Hey.
- What?

14:12.898 --> 14:14.732
I can't wait for tonight.

14:14.734 --> 14:16.367
<i>With runners at the corners</i>

14:16.369 --> 14:17.467
<i>and a one-one count,</i>

14:17.469 --> 14:18.668
<i>nobody out.</i>

14:18.670 --> 14:20.203
<i>The pitch...</i>

14:20.205 --> 14:21.571
<i>for a ball.</i>

14:21.573 --> 14:22.773
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

14:22.775 --> 14:24.608
<i>Los Angeles is now
putting themselves...</i>

14:24.610 --> 14:27.011
<i>in the mix
for the playoff hunt.</i>

14:27.013 --> 14:28.078
<i>They've got
the third lowest...</i>

14:28.080 --> 14:29.879
- Yeah.
- <i>It's tonight.</i>

14:29.881 --> 14:32.215
The drop is going down, man.
Hundred-fucking-percent.

14:32.217 --> 14:33.951
<i>Leon, whose drop?</i>

14:33.953 --> 14:35.085
<i>Tedjo.</i>

14:35.087 --> 14:36.987
- Tedjo?
- <i>Yeah, he's back.</i>

14:36.989 --> 14:38.187
Yo, man, this is big.

14:38.189 --> 14:39.523
Are you fucking sure?

14:39.525 --> 14:41.557
300 keys.
Maybe even more.

14:41.559 --> 14:43.226
<i>That's your fucking intel,
all right, Vic?</i>

14:43.228 --> 14:44.494
Oh, you done good, buddy.

14:44.496 --> 14:46.195
You done good.
Where are you?

14:46.197 --> 14:47.296
<i>Koreatown.</i>

14:47.298 --> 14:48.432
Cordova and Vermont.

14:48.434 --> 14:50.234
Where's Tedjo
making the drop?

14:51.871 --> 14:53.271
Leon?

14:53.638 --> 14:55.271
Leon! Fuck!

15:02.915 --> 15:03.917
Fuck!

15:16.129 --> 15:18.764
You got this.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.602
Out of the way!

15:24.104 --> 15:26.372
Hey, asshole! Move it!

15:27.373 --> 15:28.975
God damn it!

15:30.576 --> 15:32.876
Oh, fuck! Shit!

15:32.878 --> 15:34.011
Oh, Jesus Christ!

15:34.013 --> 15:35.481
Sorry!

15:36.282 --> 15:38.650
I'll pay for that!

15:38.652 --> 15:41.151
So you can work out
without having men ogle you.

15:41.153 --> 15:42.753
Just you
and your gal pals,

15:42.755 --> 15:44.555
listening to Sia,
getting your beach bods.

15:44.557 --> 15:46.490
Out of the way!

15:46.492 --> 15:48.993
Get out of the way!

15:48.995 --> 15:51.531
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not!

15:52.566 --> 15:54.364
- Move it! I'm a cop!
- Stop! Stop!

15:54.366 --> 15:56.067
Get all of this shit
out of the road!

15:56.069 --> 15:57.768
Yeah, yeah,
I see the bulldozer!

15:57.770 --> 15:59.170
Stop!

15:59.172 --> 16:02.173
God damn it!
God damn it!

16:02.175 --> 16:03.308
You okay, man?

16:03.310 --> 16:05.008
You assholes got a permit
for this hole?

16:05.010 --> 16:06.345
What?

16:07.413 --> 16:09.580
"These people"?

16:13.053 --> 16:14.953
Jesus Christ.

16:14.955 --> 16:17.356
Please be a five-star ride.

16:21.327 --> 16:23.293
Hey!

16:23.295 --> 16:24.662
- Uber?
- Yeah.

16:24.664 --> 16:25.830
Oh, my God.

16:25.832 --> 16:29.333
Okay. Be cool. Be nice.
Smile. Smile.

16:29.335 --> 16:32.471
- Uber?
- Yeah.

16:35.242 --> 16:36.307
Hey.

16:36.309 --> 16:37.542
Let me guess,
you want me to drive you

16:37.544 --> 16:39.410
to all the Sarah Connors
in the city, huh?

16:39.412 --> 16:41.278
Come on. Start it up.
Let's go.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.781
Oh, it's already started.

16:42.783 --> 16:44.149
Electric car.

16:44.151 --> 16:45.750
I call it
"silent but deadly."

16:45.752 --> 16:49.954
Kind of like a fart,
but instead it's a great car.

16:49.956 --> 16:51.190
Drive.

16:51.192 --> 16:53.792
I'm Stu.
How do you do?

16:53.794 --> 16:55.527
Can I get you
some bottled water?

16:55.529 --> 16:57.328
Some Canadian chocolates?

16:57.330 --> 16:58.897
It was one of those things where I
thought I was getting five bars on Amazon,

16:58.899 --> 17:01.936
- but I ended up getting five...
- Koreatown. Now.

17:03.171 --> 17:04.236
Koreatown.

17:04.238 --> 17:05.502
Now.

17:05.503 --> 17:08.640
Hold on. I'm gonna bang
a U-ey here real quick.

17:08.642 --> 17:11.409
Nope. Don't got it.
Hold on.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.480
Thank you, thank you.

17:16.284 --> 17:17.515
Oh. Didn't quite make it.

17:17.517 --> 17:18.950
- Just a second.
- Let's go!

17:18.952 --> 17:21.486
Looks like someone
drove their car into a ditch.

17:21.488 --> 17:22.654
They should put a sign up.

17:22.656 --> 17:24.223
Well, if they didn't
see the ditch,

17:24.224 --> 17:25.726
they're not gonna
see the sign.

17:26.961 --> 17:29.761
Just a couple more points
and we got it.

17:30.730 --> 17:32.564
<i>Another record-setting day</i>

17:32.566 --> 17:35.700
<i>in Los Angeles.
Hottest day since 1911.</i>

17:35.702 --> 17:38.369
<i>Stay safe, folks.
This is Madness!</i>

17:38.371 --> 17:39.572
What kind of music
do you like?

17:39.574 --> 17:41.172
I got a fully-loaded iPod.

17:41.174 --> 17:44.944
I got rap, hip-hop, R&B,
adult-contempo...

17:44.946 --> 17:46.078
world music.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.583
Name a thing, I bet I have it.
Let's play a game.

17:49.984 --> 17:51.183
Cool glasses, man.

17:51.185 --> 17:52.252
What, are you going to

17:52.254 --> 17:54.186
a racquetball game later?

17:54.188 --> 17:55.388
I can't see.

17:56.456 --> 17:58.324
Oh, my God.
You're blind?

17:58.326 --> 17:59.658
I am so sorry.

17:59.660 --> 18:00.960
I didn't know
it was like that.

18:00.962 --> 18:02.295
It'll come back.

18:02.297 --> 18:03.898
That's the spirit.

18:08.669 --> 18:10.705
Did you just throw those
out the window?

18:11.371 --> 18:13.706
I know. Classic rock.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.507
Music to work out to,
my man.

18:15.509 --> 18:18.244
Styx. What's that song?

18:24.286 --> 18:25.751
"Come Sail Away."

18:25.753 --> 18:30.390
That's what it's called!
"Come Sail Away."

18:32.493 --> 18:33.692
You know,
generally people

18:33.694 --> 18:35.494
who don't want conversation
hop in the back.

18:35.496 --> 18:37.529
If you sit shotgun,

18:37.531 --> 18:39.531
it's sort of code
that you're D-T-T.

18:39.533 --> 18:42.334
- Down-To-Talk.
- I'm more...

18:42.336 --> 18:44.438
D-T-shut-the-fuck-up.

18:45.506 --> 18:48.375
That's funny.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.243
No, seriously,
how much do you bench?

18:50.245 --> 18:51.811
Two-hundo? Three-hundo?

18:51.813 --> 18:55.147
I wanna get up to, you know,
having a 45 on each side.

18:55.149 --> 18:56.615
Bang those out.

18:56.617 --> 18:59.219
Grandfather wore glasses,
but glaucoma so...

18:59.221 --> 19:00.486
Why are we stopping?

19:00.488 --> 19:01.955
- What the hell's going on?
- Hi.

19:01.957 --> 19:03.256
- Hi.
- I'm Sloan.

19:03.258 --> 19:04.391
Melanie.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.658
- What the hell?
- The USC campus, right?

19:05.660 --> 19:07.294
- Yeah.
- Can I interest you in some

19:07.296 --> 19:08.694
Canadian chocolate?
Coffee Crisps?

19:08.696 --> 19:10.163
- We're actually late...
- Nope, we're good...

19:10.165 --> 19:11.331
...so if you could
get us there.

19:11.333 --> 19:12.399
What the hell's going on?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.733
Two young women have just

19:13.735 --> 19:15.035
gotten into the back seat
of the car.

19:15.037 --> 19:17.304
You selected
the UberPool option, so...

19:17.306 --> 19:18.371
Uber-what?

19:18.373 --> 19:19.471
UberPool.

19:19.473 --> 19:20.739
You pool the cost
of the ride

19:20.741 --> 19:22.242
with other passengers
going in the same direction.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.475
No. No.

19:23.477 --> 19:24.945
It's actually
very cost-efficient.

19:24.947 --> 19:26.513
They're going to USC
and he's just...

19:26.515 --> 19:28.615
No, no, no. Ladies,
official police business.

19:28.617 --> 19:29.748
Is that even real?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.184
Get the fuck out of the car!

19:31.186 --> 19:32.484
- Oh, God!
- Go, go!

19:32.486 --> 19:33.820
- Move it, move it!
- Stop yelling at us!

19:33.822 --> 19:35.288
- Grab your shit...
- What? No, no.

19:35.290 --> 19:36.556
- ...and get out!
- Seriously?

19:36.558 --> 19:37.857
- No, please come back!
- So lame!

19:37.859 --> 19:40.026
Please don't penalize my
star rating! Not my fault!

19:40.028 --> 19:41.562
Come on. Let's go, Steve.

19:42.563 --> 19:44.099
Come on.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.534
Are you staring at me?

19:49.638 --> 19:51.339
So, can we rewind
real quick?

19:51.341 --> 19:52.871
"Official police business"?

19:52.873 --> 19:54.207
Just going to
see a friend.

19:54.209 --> 19:57.644
Never Uber'd a cop before.
Ever been shot?

19:57.646 --> 20:00.146
Ever taken a bullet
for someone?

20:00.148 --> 20:01.415
What do you mean?

20:01.417 --> 20:02.816
Like, have you ever...

20:02.818 --> 20:05.318
jumped in front of someone
and taken a bullet

20:05.320 --> 20:07.053
that was intended
for that person?

20:07.055 --> 20:09.055
You know what I mean?

20:09.057 --> 20:12.761
Person, bullet, you.

20:14.230 --> 20:15.863
You think
by the time a gun is fired

20:15.865 --> 20:18.999
that you can jump
in front of a bullet?

20:19.001 --> 20:20.633
Now I'm starting
to question it.

20:20.635 --> 20:22.702
Yeah, we don't live
in slow-motion land, kid.

20:22.704 --> 20:23.837
I bet you're
also wondering...

20:23.839 --> 20:25.538
if I've ever walked away
from a big explosion

20:25.540 --> 20:27.074
and not looked over
my shoulder.

20:27.076 --> 20:28.142
You've made your point.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.210
Shot out the tires on a car
speeding towards me.

20:30.212 --> 20:31.911
A hundred times over.

20:31.913 --> 20:33.046
We're here.

20:33.949 --> 20:35.815
It's been
a five-star ride for me.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.717
Hope it's been
a five-star ride for you.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.253
If you want
your five stars...

20:39.255 --> 20:40.621
keep the meter running.

20:40.623 --> 20:41.788
Oh, there's no meter.

20:41.790 --> 20:43.156
People will just
call another Uber.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.159
That's...

20:45.328 --> 20:46.928
Bye, forever!

20:51.100 --> 20:52.101
Wow.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.308
"Andre the giant
motherfucker."

21:02.612 --> 21:04.247
God damn it.

21:11.154 --> 21:12.789
Hurry up.

21:13.089 --> 21:14.257
Leon!

21:19.295 --> 21:20.662
Leon!

21:21.264 --> 21:24.031
Damn it!

21:24.033 --> 21:25.201
Leon!

21:37.880 --> 21:39.713
Smooth operator speaking.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.815
<i>Fucking Byron, man!
He's a piece of shit!</i>

21:41.817 --> 21:43.551
He came over.
He goes to the bathroom...

21:43.553 --> 21:45.152
I obviously immediately
look at his phone.

21:45.154 --> 21:47.655
<i>It's fucking full
of all these pictures...</i>

21:47.657 --> 21:48.756
of all these girls who look

21:48.758 --> 21:49.990
barely out of
fucking high school.

21:49.992 --> 21:52.461
<i>It's like vagina, vagina,
vagina, vagina.</i>

21:52.463 --> 21:55.663
<i>Oh, my God!
I broke up with him!</i>

21:55.665 --> 21:58.265
Becca, you are a queen.

21:58.267 --> 22:00.235
Byron is a full-on
piece of shit

22:00.237 --> 22:01.503
and he doesn't deserve you.

22:01.505 --> 22:03.771
<i>I wanna lock myself in my
apartment like</i> Grey Gardens.

22:03.773 --> 22:05.139
<i>I want to</i>
Grey Gardens <i>myself.</i>

22:05.141 --> 22:07.007
That is the most depressing
verb I've ever heard.

22:07.009 --> 22:08.676
<i>I wanna scream
into a cup for six years.</i>

22:08.678 --> 22:09.810
<i>I'm gonna start drinking.</i>

22:09.812 --> 22:12.447
<i>Then Yogurtland,
then vengeance.</i>

22:12.449 --> 22:13.882
- Tequila?
- <i>Yes.</i>

22:13.884 --> 22:15.083
God, yes. Always.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.418
<i>Well, I'll bring a bottle
and some yogurt.</i>

22:17.420 --> 22:19.720
- You decide the order, okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

22:19.722 --> 22:22.159
<i>Stu, will you hurry?</i>

22:23.060 --> 22:24.226
<i>I really need you.</i>

22:24.228 --> 22:25.726
I'm just gonna drop off
Douche Lundgren

22:25.728 --> 22:26.995
and I'll be right over, okay?

22:26.997 --> 22:27.996
<i>Okay.</i>

22:27.998 --> 22:30.097
All right.
Okay, you hang up first.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.466
<i>Okay, I'm hanging up.</i>

22:31.468 --> 22:33.403
No. Oh. She's gone.

22:38.909 --> 22:40.375
Yes!

22:40.377 --> 22:42.910
Leon, where's the drop?

22:42.912 --> 22:45.382
If you're using again.
Leon!

23:01.633 --> 23:03.167
I'm sorry, Leon.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.147
So did you
find your friend?

23:18.781 --> 23:20.817
Is that blood?

23:25.022 --> 23:26.191
No.

23:27.625 --> 23:28.689
All right. So we're done.

23:28.691 --> 23:31.026
I'll just drop you off
where I picked...

23:33.730 --> 23:35.764
Yo, Amber.

23:35.766 --> 23:39.204
What's up, girl?
It's Leon!

23:40.071 --> 23:41.636
Yeah!

23:41.638 --> 23:43.271
Been a minute.

23:43.273 --> 23:45.974
Yeah. Where you at, girl?

23:45.976 --> 23:49.345
All right, you know
I can dig that. Ha!

23:49.347 --> 23:52.681
All right, you keep
that ass warm for Leon.

23:52.683 --> 23:53.782
Ha-ha!

23:53.784 --> 23:56.086
Yeah. You know that, girl.

23:58.590 --> 24:01.190
Very problematic.

24:01.192 --> 24:02.458
Sizzle Room. Compton.

24:02.460 --> 24:06.027
What other races can you do impressions of?
Can you do me?

24:06.029 --> 24:07.262
Compton!

24:07.264 --> 24:08.830
Okay, stop just
yelling neighborhoods.

24:08.832 --> 24:10.335
That's not
how Uber works, okay?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.401
You're quick to anger.

24:24.148 --> 24:26.382
Oh, didn't
quite make it.

24:26.384 --> 24:27.484
Oh, come on.

24:27.486 --> 24:29.217
And I'm parked.

24:31.422 --> 24:32.856
Let's go.

24:35.960 --> 24:36.961
Hey.

24:42.233 --> 24:43.699
- Yes?
- Come on.

24:43.701 --> 24:45.234
I don't want you
driving off on me.

24:45.236 --> 24:47.570
Nah. I'm all sizzled out
for the day.

24:47.572 --> 24:48.771
Thanks for
the invite, though.

24:48.773 --> 24:49.839
Let's go.

24:49.841 --> 24:51.007
I'm not going in there.

24:51.009 --> 24:52.475
The Sizzle Room's
health grade is a B.

24:52.477 --> 24:54.510
Which I'm pretty sure
stands for Hepatitis B.

24:54.512 --> 24:56.912
Look, I know you think you have more
important things to do right now.

24:56.914 --> 24:58.816
- I do.
- You don't.

24:59.551 --> 25:01.851
Now I paid for a driver...

25:01.853 --> 25:04.020
and I'm getting
a fucking driver...

25:04.022 --> 25:06.222
with little gold stars.

25:06.224 --> 25:07.392
Come on.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.294
It smells
like balls in here.

25:11.296 --> 25:12.696
Wonder why.

25:16.268 --> 25:18.269
This is the bar.

25:19.638 --> 25:22.805
Hey. Looking for
Amber Titties.

25:22.807 --> 25:25.242
It's pronounced Tittyais.
It's French.

25:25.244 --> 25:26.343
She's in the back.

25:26.345 --> 25:27.311
Come on. Let's go.

25:27.313 --> 25:29.245
Uh, no, I'll respect
the dancers' privacy.

25:29.247 --> 25:31.447
What's wrong? You've never
seen a naked woman before?

25:31.449 --> 25:32.451
Come on.

25:43.394 --> 25:45.562
Drunk bastard
just gave me a dollar.

25:45.564 --> 25:46.931
Cool.

25:49.902 --> 25:53.402
<i>And that was Thor!</i>

25:53.404 --> 25:55.271
<i>A lot of security
back here.</i>

25:55.273 --> 25:58.477
I'm gonna check it out.
Stay put.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.814
So, yes,
I'll have them see the house

26:02.816 --> 26:04.181
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.416
That looks good.
What is that? Chicken salad?

26:06.418 --> 26:08.851
- Mm-hmm. You want a bite?
- No thank you, sweetie.

26:08.853 --> 26:09.953
But here's the thing though,

26:09.955 --> 26:11.121
you really think
you should be eating that?

26:11.123 --> 26:12.689
Well, I mean,
I am hungry.

26:12.691 --> 26:13.924
Water only...

26:13.926 --> 26:15.959
four hours before stage!
Ain't that right, fellas?

26:15.961 --> 26:18.160
- Yeah. Yes, ma'am.
- Them's the rules.

26:18.162 --> 26:19.830
Not even, like,
a granola bar?

26:19.832 --> 26:21.965
- Is that healthy?
- Who the fuck are you?

26:21.967 --> 26:23.200
Oh, no, actually,
I just mean carbs...

26:23.202 --> 26:24.702
- are unfairly demonized.
- No.

26:24.704 --> 26:25.803
If that's how he's lookin',

26:25.805 --> 26:26.903
I wouldn't change
what he's cookin'.

26:26.905 --> 26:28.772
- It's fine.
- Oh, it's fine?

26:28.774 --> 26:30.005
So you think
people come in here to see

26:30.007 --> 26:31.508
a fat piece of shit
floppin' his tits around?

26:31.510 --> 26:32.709
I don't have tits!

26:32.711 --> 26:36.446
Nobody wants to see a big dick
hanging off a bag of garbage.

26:36.448 --> 26:39.517
Shouldn't have weighed in.
I'm sorry. Not a pun.

26:39.519 --> 26:40.950
Oh, no, no.
Please continue to

26:40.952 --> 26:42.619
mansplain to me
what I'm supposed to be doing.

26:42.621 --> 26:46.056
'Cause, you know, as a woman,
I have no fucking idea!

26:46.058 --> 26:47.658
You do your thing.

26:47.660 --> 26:49.059
I'll go fuck myself.

26:49.061 --> 26:52.196
Thank you so much
for giving me permission.

26:52.198 --> 26:54.131
Are you still eating that?

26:54.133 --> 26:55.532
- Ms. Titties?
- Tittyais.

26:55.534 --> 26:57.936
Who the fuck's asking?
We not hiring, honey.

26:58.404 --> 26:59.336
LAPD.

26:59.338 --> 27:00.939
Need to talk to you
for a second.

27:02.941 --> 27:05.575
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. It's my fault.

27:05.577 --> 27:06.744
You don't have man boobs.

27:06.746 --> 27:08.412
Her bark is way more vicious
than her bite.

27:08.414 --> 27:10.415
That's not true.
She bit me. It really hurt.

27:10.417 --> 27:12.650
Hey, can you give me a hand
with something?

27:12.652 --> 27:15.019
Your self-esteem?

27:15.021 --> 27:17.722
She was up
by twelve points in August.

27:17.724 --> 27:19.489
I was all in.

27:23.696 --> 27:25.231
Oh, man.

27:28.534 --> 27:30.400
Three red roses?

27:30.402 --> 27:33.538
Girl is thirsty.

27:33.540 --> 27:34.806
He was a good man.

27:34.808 --> 27:36.974
A loyal customer.
A friend.

27:36.976 --> 27:39.310
So were you two
close, close?

27:39.312 --> 27:41.712
Leon was
a complicated man.

27:41.714 --> 27:44.916
He liked blowjobs
from the back.

27:44.918 --> 27:46.284
That's tough.

27:46.286 --> 27:47.251
Weird.

27:47.253 --> 27:51.055
I just love her, man.
I do. Since college.

27:51.057 --> 27:53.023
- Does she know?
- No.

27:53.025 --> 27:54.292
You know, we had sex once...

27:54.294 --> 27:55.827
like a year and-a-half ago.

27:55.829 --> 27:57.094
She was going
through a breakup.

27:57.096 --> 27:58.963
I'm over at her house,
and we're getting drunk...

27:58.965 --> 28:01.065
we're watching
<i>When Harry Met Sally...</i>

28:01.067 --> 28:02.534
and then one thing
lead to another...

28:02.536 --> 28:06.136
and then her Harry met
my Sally and it was great.

28:06.138 --> 28:08.105
But then she acted
like nothing happened.

28:08.107 --> 28:09.875
So then I acted
like nothing happened,

28:09.877 --> 28:11.511
and so then
nothing happened.

28:13.379 --> 28:14.715
All right. Look.

28:15.982 --> 28:17.515
You need to tell her
how you feel.

28:17.517 --> 28:20.751
A relationship cannot thrive
without honesty.

28:20.753 --> 28:22.286
That's why
Amber calls me out

28:22.288 --> 28:23.622
for being
a fat piece of dogshit.

28:23.624 --> 28:25.757
That's abuse.
That's a different thing.

28:25.759 --> 28:27.893
No, it's love. Tough love.

28:27.895 --> 28:29.126
Look, we about
to get a rush.

28:29.128 --> 28:30.595
What's your fat
Freddie Mercury-looking-ass

28:30.597 --> 28:31.830
got for me?

28:31.832 --> 28:32.997
All right.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
Let's cut the shit.

28:39.907 --> 28:41.205
Tedjo.

28:41.207 --> 28:42.841
Leon ever mentioned
that name to you?

28:42.843 --> 28:44.408
Say anything
about a big shipment?

28:44.410 --> 28:47.078
Think real hard,
Ms. Tittyais.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.013
That's why I dropped
all the charges against Amber.

28:49.015 --> 28:50.115
Oh.

28:50.117 --> 28:51.216
Wait, wait,
that's her ringtone.

28:51.218 --> 28:52.851
That's Becca's ringtone.

28:52.853 --> 28:54.285
I need a good background.

28:54.287 --> 28:56.089
What's a good,
neutral background?

28:57.056 --> 28:59.190
- Hey!
- <i>Hello. Guess who just wrote</i>

28:59.192 --> 29:02.594
roughly fourteen paragraphs
on Byron's Facebook page...

29:02.596 --> 29:05.731
<i>about what a worthless
sleazebag he is.</i>

29:05.733 --> 29:07.566
Ah, yes.
The revenge phase.

29:07.568 --> 29:10.936
<i>Three glasses of Savah-Bee
will do that to a girl.</i>

29:10.938 --> 29:12.004
Yep, you are drunk.

29:12.006 --> 29:13.772
<i>The alcohol
is actually helping.</i>

29:13.774 --> 29:15.641
<i>Because it's
giving me clarity.</i>

29:15.643 --> 29:16.808
Clarity?

29:16.810 --> 29:18.877
- What kind of clarity?
- <i>Okay.</i>

29:18.879 --> 29:21.880
<i>Um, did I just see a penis?
Where are you?</i>

29:21.882 --> 29:23.815
Oh. Nowhere,
nowhere, nowhere.

29:23.817 --> 29:24.884
<i>Did I just see
a dick the size</i>

29:24.886 --> 29:26.552
<i>of Simon Birch,
or what's going on?</i>

29:26.554 --> 29:28.219
Don't worry.
What were you saying?

29:28.221 --> 29:30.989
- "Clarity"?
- <i>Okay, I have this crazy idea.</i>

29:30.991 --> 29:32.958
I'm feeling
a lot of stuff right now.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.527
<i>With the business and you.</i>

29:35.529 --> 29:38.564
<i>I want you to come over.
And I want to watch...</i>

29:38.566 --> 29:39.599
When Harry Met Sally.

29:39.601 --> 29:41.466
<i>Remember the time we did it?</i>

29:41.468 --> 29:42.868
Did what?

29:42.870 --> 29:44.536
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

29:44.538 --> 29:45.972
<i>I don't wanna put you
in a weird position...</i>

29:45.974 --> 29:47.306
<i>if you don't wanna
do it again.</i>

29:47.308 --> 29:49.008
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not a weird position.

29:49.010 --> 29:50.175
It's a good position.

29:50.177 --> 29:52.477
You know what?
Yeah, let's do it.

29:52.479 --> 29:55.080
<i>Okay, great! Cool.</i>
<i>I'm here!</i>

29:55.082 --> 29:56.682
I'll just come right over.

29:56.684 --> 29:59.320
And, uh, we'll do it.

29:59.587 --> 30:00.753
Beep!

30:00.755 --> 30:02.254
No take backs.

30:04.658 --> 30:07.526
- Did you hear that?
- Becca wants to fuck!

30:07.528 --> 30:09.094
Oh, my God!
What am I gonna do?

30:09.096 --> 30:11.396
- You're gonna fuck!
- But then what?

30:11.398 --> 30:12.632
We just don't
talk about it?

30:12.634 --> 30:15.001
Not this time. This time
you tell her how you feel.

30:15.003 --> 30:17.436
You open your heart.
You be honest. Go.

30:17.438 --> 30:19.171
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Lock it down.

30:19.173 --> 30:21.306
- Lock it down.
- Lock it down.

30:21.308 --> 30:23.676
I'm gonna lock it down.
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

30:23.678 --> 30:25.179
Amo.

30:25.547 --> 30:26.980
Amo Cortez.

30:26.982 --> 30:28.113
Amo Cortez?

30:28.115 --> 30:30.248
Leon did a minute
in Lancaster.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.985
Amo was his cellmate.

30:31.987 --> 30:34.053
I overheard them
talking last week.

30:34.055 --> 30:35.888
He was trying to get Leon
in on something.

30:35.890 --> 30:37.190
He said it was
gonna be big.

30:37.192 --> 30:38.727
You know
where I could find Amo?

30:40.327 --> 30:43.328
Runs with the Alamitos 13.

30:43.330 --> 30:44.833
That's all I know.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.502
Steve. Let's go.

30:49.371 --> 30:50.372
Steve!

30:52.506 --> 30:53.540
Uh...

30:55.142 --> 30:57.777
Where are my keys?

30:57.779 --> 30:59.412
Going somewhere?

30:59.414 --> 31:01.115
- Those are mine!
- Nah, they're mine

31:01.117 --> 31:02.448
- until I'm done with you.
- No, no, no.

31:02.450 --> 31:03.616
I'm going to see Becca
right now.

31:03.618 --> 31:05.250
No. Long Beach.
Then we'll talk.

31:05.252 --> 31:07.053
- Fuck Long Beach. Fuck you.
- Hey!

31:09.357 --> 31:11.224
I will drag your ass
to jail.

31:11.226 --> 31:12.960
A white cop dragging around

31:12.962 --> 31:14.293
a brown man.
That'll look great.

31:14.295 --> 31:15.865
I'm not white.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.296
You're not white?

31:18.298 --> 31:20.702
What are you? Puerto Rican?

31:21.836 --> 31:24.673
Mexican? Libyan? Chilean?

31:25.841 --> 31:27.074
You're not Chinese.

31:27.076 --> 31:28.841
- I'm the racist one?
- You look like...

31:28.843 --> 31:31.611
if all the ugly people
in every race fucked!

31:31.613 --> 31:34.282
Come on, let's go.
Long Beach.

31:34.950 --> 31:36.652
Get in the car!

31:43.591 --> 31:45.525
You were right.

31:45.527 --> 31:47.895
Yeah, they were just here.

31:47.897 --> 31:49.532
Yeah, there's two of them.

31:53.702 --> 31:55.268
So this Becca chick
says, "Jump."

31:55.270 --> 31:56.669
And you say, "How high?"

31:56.671 --> 31:58.337
If you knew her,
you'd jump too.

31:58.339 --> 32:00.074
- You'd pole vault.
- Oh. Bullshit.

32:00.076 --> 32:01.475
I don't jump for anybody.

32:01.477 --> 32:03.544
'Cause I've got self-respect.
You know what that is?

32:03.546 --> 32:05.712
Is that when a blind cop
kidnaps an Uber driver?

32:05.714 --> 32:08.015
When I was 14 years old,
my dad took me on a...

32:08.017 --> 32:09.550
camping trip
out in the desert.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.151
First night there he jumps
in his truck, he says,

32:11.153 --> 32:12.586
"I'm going into town
to get some groceries."

32:12.588 --> 32:13.954
You know
what that really meant?

32:13.956 --> 32:15.389
That meant
he was going into town

32:15.391 --> 32:17.057
to get drunk
and hook up with a local.

32:17.059 --> 32:18.158
You know,
I don't remember

32:18.160 --> 32:19.325
signing up for
this <i>TED Talk.</i>

32:19.327 --> 32:21.061
First few hours go by
and I think

32:21.063 --> 32:22.629
he's probably
got a flat tire.

32:22.631 --> 32:25.532
Then it gets dark, and then it gets cold.
I'm hungry.

32:25.534 --> 32:27.267
There is shit in the desert
making noise.

32:27.269 --> 32:29.103
I'm scared to death.

32:29.105 --> 32:30.503
And?

32:30.505 --> 32:32.271
So I sat there all night
freezing my ass off.

32:32.273 --> 32:34.944
Starving, clutching this
pen knife till dawn.

32:36.879 --> 32:38.278
This pen knife.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.848
It's all I had.
It got me through.

32:39.850 --> 32:41.982
No, it didn't.
The pen knife did nothing.

32:41.984 --> 32:44.318
It was just a psychological
security blanket.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.387
Also, you had a terrible,
abusive father.

32:47.389 --> 32:49.623
I became a man that night.
That's the point.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.625
You don't need to drop
your kids off in the desert...

32:51.627 --> 32:53.392
to teach them
how to be a man.

32:53.394 --> 32:55.030
What do you know
about being a man?

32:57.633 --> 33:00.001
Wow, this place
is not gentrified at all.

33:00.003 --> 33:01.368
- We're here?
- Hey, you think...

33:01.370 --> 33:03.171
these guys will be gracious
enough to let me use an outlet

33:03.173 --> 33:04.907
- to charge my car?
- Probably not.

33:06.709 --> 33:07.574
Nuh-uh.

33:07.576 --> 33:09.009
I'm gonna hold onto these.

33:09.011 --> 33:10.744
I'd tell you to stay
in the car, but I figure...

33:10.746 --> 33:13.214
you're too afraid
to get out, so...

33:13.216 --> 33:15.917
I'm not too afraid
to get out.

33:15.919 --> 33:17.351
I just don't want to.

33:17.353 --> 33:19.455
I'm choosing
to stay in the car.

33:28.931 --> 33:30.999
LAPD. Open up.

33:31.001 --> 33:32.432
What?

33:32.434 --> 33:33.534
Five-oh! Five-Oh!
- Get this shit.

33:33.536 --> 33:35.335
Get it out of here, man!

33:35.337 --> 33:36.871
Get the crystal.
What are you doing?

33:36.873 --> 33:38.708
There's some
in the back. In the back!

33:43.712 --> 33:45.213
Amo Cortez?

33:45.215 --> 33:47.148
Sorry, homie.
This ain't LAPD territory.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.249
Yeah, it is now.

33:48.251 --> 33:49.820
- Hey!
- What the fuck, man?

34:01.364 --> 34:03.934
"Yo, Becs! 'Sup...

34:04.767 --> 34:06.100
"girl?

34:06.102 --> 34:08.368
"I'll be slightly late.

34:08.370 --> 34:10.972
"But I'll be right over...

34:10.974 --> 34:13.074
"so we can...

34:13.077 --> 34:15.079
"have sex."

34:15.712 --> 34:16.878
No.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.648
"Get down."

34:19.248 --> 34:20.849
That's too vague.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.116
"So, we can...

34:22.118 --> 34:24.953
"achieve penetration."

34:24.955 --> 34:26.288
Nope, that's not it.

34:26.290 --> 34:27.655
Don't you need a warrant
or some shit?

34:27.657 --> 34:29.324
You think
I'm playing games?

34:29.326 --> 34:30.860
I guess you won't miss
your big, fancy TV then.

34:33.096 --> 34:34.697
Dude, that's a fish tank.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.802
That's the microwave,
homes.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.435
What the hell?
You guys just sit around...

34:41.437 --> 34:43.339
and watch fish all day?
How's that?

34:43.341 --> 34:45.174
And, I'm gonna give you
five seconds

34:45.176 --> 34:47.076
to tell me
where Amo Cortez is!

34:47.078 --> 34:48.779
"So, we can...

34:49.646 --> 34:50.913
"...fuck."

34:50.915 --> 34:52.447
Yeah. That's it.

34:52.449 --> 34:54.181
People say that.

34:54.184 --> 34:55.850
I wanna fuck you.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.819
No. "So, we can...

34:57.821 --> 35:02.591
"do the thing
that we had...

35:02.593 --> 35:05.126
"decided upon."
That's good, that's good.

35:05.128 --> 35:07.329
Sent.

35:07.331 --> 35:09.031
God, what have I done?

35:09.033 --> 35:10.498
Attack, Pico!

35:10.500 --> 35:11.736
What's wrong with him?

35:18.475 --> 35:19.909
You assholes.

35:19.911 --> 35:21.710
How much you feed him?

35:21.712 --> 35:23.080
I said how much
you feed him?

35:26.517 --> 35:28.150
How do you like that,
tough guy?

35:28.152 --> 35:29.517
How does that taste?
Taste good?

35:29.519 --> 35:31.353
How do you like that,
asshole?

35:31.355 --> 35:33.155
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time!

35:33.157 --> 35:35.092
Where's Amo Cortez?

35:36.961 --> 35:38.295
Hello, Amo.

35:38.297 --> 35:39.827
Fuck you guys, man!

35:39.829 --> 35:41.529
"It's not the size
of the boat

35:41.531 --> 35:42.664
it's the motion..."

35:42.666 --> 35:44.233
Yo, this illegal
as fuck, man!

35:44.235 --> 35:46.468
You can't just walk in my
momma's house like this!

35:46.470 --> 35:48.737
<i>Tio,</i> do something, man!
This is bullshit.

35:48.739 --> 35:50.506
Police brutality in here!

35:50.508 --> 35:51.839
Shit! Watch out

35:51.841 --> 35:54.145
- for the fucking car, man.
- Hey, hey.

35:55.746 --> 35:57.947
Fuck you, homie!
I got fucking rights!

35:57.949 --> 35:59.316
No. Fuck you, homie!

35:59.318 --> 36:00.749
You're looking at five years
for possession.

36:00.751 --> 36:03.253
- Unless you wanna talk.
- Uh, Vic?

36:03.255 --> 36:04.452
No?

36:04.454 --> 36:06.188
Watch him. I'll be back.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.556
This is bullshit, man!

36:07.558 --> 36:10.459
No. No, no. Vic. Vic.
No, no, no.

36:10.461 --> 36:13.529
Hey, hey, hey.
You cannot just leave him in my car.

36:13.531 --> 36:15.131
This is a hard no for me.

36:15.133 --> 36:17.967
- This is an UberPool, right?
- No, it's not an UberPool!

36:17.969 --> 36:18.934
Don't act like...

36:18.936 --> 36:20.736
you know
what UberPool is, okay?

36:20.738 --> 36:22.640
You learned that
earlier today.

36:24.843 --> 36:25.875
Here, take this.

36:25.877 --> 36:27.610
Oh, no, I am not
touching that.

36:27.612 --> 36:28.777
He can help me crack a case

36:28.779 --> 36:30.279
I've been working on
for years!

36:30.281 --> 36:31.448
He's handcuffed.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.316
- He's locked in a car.
- I'm not doing it.

36:33.318 --> 36:34.583
- The safety's on.
- No.

36:34.585 --> 36:35.819
Just point it at him.

36:35.821 --> 36:37.287
Don't let him smell
you're a civilian.

36:37.289 --> 36:39.089
Two minutes.
You get your five stars...

36:39.091 --> 36:41.056
and you're free
to go see your girl, man.

36:41.058 --> 36:44.062
And you get to tell her how
you helped an officer in need.

36:44.363 --> 36:45.694
Steve...

36:45.696 --> 36:47.565
this is your night
in the desert.

36:54.373 --> 36:56.473
My name is Stu.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.642
Fuck you.

37:02.247 --> 37:04.880
Hey, asshole!
How many bags did you feed the dog?

37:04.882 --> 37:07.518
I don't know, man.
I lost count.

37:08.220 --> 37:09.587
What?

37:09.955 --> 37:11.388
We good.

37:12.624 --> 37:15.991
You okay, buddy?
You okay?

37:15.993 --> 37:17.129
Yeah.

37:29.174 --> 37:30.306
Is this an Uber?

37:30.308 --> 37:32.108
Man, fuck this!
I'm out of here.

37:32.110 --> 37:33.176
Hey!

37:33.178 --> 37:35.011
This ain't no Uber.

37:35.013 --> 37:36.414
I'm undercover.

37:36.416 --> 37:39.649
And I'm the bad cop,
you little girl.

37:39.651 --> 37:42.085
- Open this door!
- My partner may look scary...

37:42.087 --> 37:44.821
but I'm the wolf
in sheep's clothing.

37:44.823 --> 37:46.524
- What?
- Back at the precinct

37:46.526 --> 37:48.860
they call me "Wolf".

37:55.501 --> 37:57.200
Stop that!
Why are you laughing?

37:57.202 --> 37:58.369
Stop that!

37:58.371 --> 37:59.736
Stop! Stop that!

37:59.738 --> 38:01.771
Stop laughing! I'm a cop!
I'm being for real!

38:01.773 --> 38:03.240
Fuck you! You ain't no cop!

38:03.242 --> 38:04.307
I am a cop!

38:04.309 --> 38:05.375
I'll take you downtown!

38:05.377 --> 38:06.709
Stop that!

38:06.711 --> 38:08.812
You're gonna go to jail!

38:08.814 --> 38:10.347
I'll fucking
book you, man!

38:10.349 --> 38:11.549
No!

38:11.551 --> 38:13.484
Please, please! Stop it!

38:13.486 --> 38:15.021
Stop kicking!

38:15.556 --> 38:18.088
Oh, shit!

38:18.090 --> 38:19.589
How dare you!

38:19.591 --> 38:21.194
You fucking shot me!

38:23.329 --> 38:24.962
Fuck!

38:24.964 --> 38:26.797
- You shot me, man!
- What the hell did you do?

38:26.799 --> 38:29.032
- You said the safety was on!
- It was!

38:29.034 --> 38:32.570
Oh, my God! He's bleeding out!
I killed him!

38:32.572 --> 38:33.803
You got shot in the leg.

38:33.805 --> 38:35.072
Good for you. Take Pico.

38:35.074 --> 38:38.277
Hey, asshole, get your ass
back in that car.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.044
Hey, Amo.

38:41.046 --> 38:43.680
Talk to me. Tedjo deal.

38:43.682 --> 38:46.517
Hey. The Tedjo deal,
what do you know?

38:46.519 --> 38:48.085
It's going down.

38:48.087 --> 38:50.355
- When?
- Tonight!

38:50.357 --> 38:51.654
- Where?
- At the...

38:51.656 --> 38:53.190
Hey, hey!

38:53.192 --> 38:54.691
At the...

38:54.693 --> 38:56.362
Don't you pass out.

38:57.497 --> 39:00.264
God damn it.
He passed out.

39:00.266 --> 39:02.068
All right, we gotta
get this guy to the hospital.

39:02.336 --> 39:03.933
Oh, God.

39:03.935 --> 39:06.139
What should I do
with this dog?

39:07.340 --> 39:10.040
Mr. Cortez,
I want you to know I'm really sorry!

39:10.042 --> 39:11.976
He can't hear you.
He's in shock.

39:13.846 --> 39:16.380
Are you... Oh, come on.

39:16.382 --> 39:17.548
You need a tissue?

39:17.550 --> 39:18.816
Teddy bear?

39:18.818 --> 39:21.586
You got a blanky in the trunk
you want me to grab?

39:21.588 --> 39:22.686
Jesus.

39:22.688 --> 39:24.722
I'm really overwhelmed
right now.

39:24.724 --> 39:26.057
Tears are a natural response

39:26.059 --> 39:27.858
to the immense pressure
I'm currently experiencing.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.093
Yeah, sure. Naturally.

39:29.095 --> 39:30.694
Everyone cries.
It's good for you.

39:30.696 --> 39:32.229
I don't cry.
Pico doesn't cry.

39:32.231 --> 39:33.532
You cried
when you were a baby.

39:33.534 --> 39:34.798
Nope. Never.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.434
- You don't remember that.
- I remember my birth.

39:36.436 --> 39:38.103
Oh, you're getting rid
of the murder weapon!

39:38.105 --> 39:39.603
Take Sepulveda
over to Crenshaw.

39:39.605 --> 39:41.172
There's a hospital there.

39:41.174 --> 39:43.240
Okay, okay. Hospital.

39:43.242 --> 39:45.009
Good. It's a hospital. Okay.

39:45.011 --> 39:48.013
Oh, God. Oh, God.

39:48.015 --> 39:50.081
Come on! Get your ass
over here and help me!

39:51.584 --> 39:53.951
- You said hospital!
- This is a hospital.

39:53.953 --> 39:55.819
- It's a animal hospital!
- He's an animal.

39:55.821 --> 39:57.855
Oh, yeah,
we'll check him for heartworms!

39:57.857 --> 39:59.524
- Get his leg.
- Sorry.

39:59.526 --> 40:01.459
Sorry, sorry!
All right, sorry.

40:01.461 --> 40:04.330
- Hello, Victor.
- Hey, doc.

40:13.373 --> 40:15.873
Take a deep breath, all right?
You didn't do anything wrong.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.310
I shot a guy.
I'm gonna go to jail.

40:18.312 --> 40:19.644
I'm the guy who would
arrest you for that,

40:19.646 --> 40:20.878
and I'm not gonna arrest you.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.247
That scumbag over there...

40:22.249 --> 40:23.649
sells heroin to kids.

40:23.651 --> 40:25.185
Now sit down.

40:27.654 --> 40:29.654
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

40:29.656 --> 40:31.089
Just some mild
tissue damage.

40:31.091 --> 40:33.191
- Pooch okay?
- He's good.

40:33.193 --> 40:35.894
Eight more came out.
What do you wanna do with him?

40:35.896 --> 40:37.331
Find him a good home.

40:38.466 --> 40:39.664
He'll wake up soon.

40:39.666 --> 40:41.199
Just tell him to stay off
that leg for a while.

40:41.201 --> 40:43.335
All right, I'm coming!

40:43.337 --> 40:44.803
Hold on to your poop bags.

40:44.805 --> 40:45.937
Hey, Pico.
How are you, boy?

40:45.939 --> 40:48.441
Come here.
Come on, pup-pup.

40:48.443 --> 40:50.775
Let's go, Peanut.
There we go.

40:50.777 --> 40:52.379
I'll be back.

40:53.746 --> 40:56.214
All right. Wake up, asshole.

40:56.216 --> 40:57.415
Tedjo deal.

40:57.417 --> 40:58.651
When and where?

40:58.653 --> 41:01.554
- Fuck you, pig.
- Oh, yeah?

41:01.556 --> 41:03.555
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?

41:03.557 --> 41:04.925
Now, when and where?

41:06.994 --> 41:09.830
Oh, Amo, you just don't wanna
make this easy, do you?

41:11.865 --> 41:13.332
When and where?

41:13.334 --> 41:15.101
Hey, hey, hey! Stop that.
Stop torturing him.

41:15.103 --> 41:16.434
Says the guy who shot him.

41:16.436 --> 41:17.769
Well, I didn't do it
on purpose.

41:17.771 --> 41:19.871
And I feel really horrible
about it.

41:19.873 --> 41:21.006
- Hey! When and where?
- Shit!

41:21.008 --> 41:22.107
You know what?
I have an idea.

41:22.109 --> 41:23.175
You don't always
have to use brute force.

41:23.177 --> 41:24.477
You can use
your brain sometimes.

41:24.479 --> 41:25.544
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:25.546 --> 41:27.380
All right. Let's see this.

41:29.016 --> 41:30.518
This is
your phone, right?

41:31.952 --> 41:34.052
Yeah. Sure is.

41:34.054 --> 41:35.988
Oh, look,
you've got Twitter. Perfect.

41:35.990 --> 41:37.757
What are you doing, man?

41:37.759 --> 41:42.762
"I love Ryan Gosling."

41:42.764 --> 41:44.829
- Open parenthesis.
- What? What?

41:44.831 --> 41:48.668
- "So hot."
- No!

41:48.670 --> 41:49.969
- Send.
- What the...

41:49.971 --> 41:51.803
Look, bunch of notifications
coming in.

41:51.805 --> 41:53.439
Very engaged audience.

41:53.441 --> 41:55.106
"Here are my favorite...

41:55.108 --> 41:57.076
"...Ryan Gosling movies."

41:57.078 --> 41:58.678
- No, no, no!
- "Number three...

41:58.680 --> 41:59.945
<i>"The Notebook."</i>

41:59.947 --> 42:01.547
- No!
- "Number two...

42:01.549 --> 42:03.449
<i>"The Notebook."</i>

42:03.451 --> 42:05.050
- What?
- "Number one...

42:05.052 --> 42:09.221
<i>"La La Land."</i> Send.

42:09.223 --> 42:12.158
- I hate Gosling, man!
- "Our leader..."

42:12.160 --> 42:14.327
What's the name
of the leader?

42:14.329 --> 42:15.528
Doc Ramirez, right?

42:15.530 --> 42:17.896
- Doc?
- "Doc Ramirez...

42:17.898 --> 42:19.365
"wears diapers...

42:19.367 --> 42:24.471
"because he is lactose
intolerant and loves cheese."

42:24.473 --> 42:25.907
That's a lie!

42:27.075 --> 42:29.041
I'm gonna hit "send".

42:29.043 --> 42:31.577
I wonder if Doc Ramirez
will see this.

42:31.579 --> 42:33.379
1:00 a.m.
at the salvage yard!

42:33.381 --> 42:34.916
- Yes.
- Hey, stop!

42:36.352 --> 42:37.353
I'm gonna go.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.088
Hey.

42:40.021 --> 42:42.121
I get it.
It was too much for you.

42:42.123 --> 42:44.123
Oh, you mean shooting
an unarmed, handcuffed man...

42:44.125 --> 42:46.426
in the back seat of
the electric vehicle I lease?

42:46.428 --> 42:48.395
Yeah, it was a lot.

42:48.397 --> 42:50.697
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

42:50.699 --> 42:52.600
but go fuck yourself.

43:00.476 --> 43:02.376
Stay right there.

43:02.378 --> 43:03.777
Bad things
happen to people...

43:03.779 --> 43:07.382
but it doesn't affect them
if they don't think about it.

43:08.550 --> 43:10.517
You are doing great.

43:10.519 --> 43:12.454
Just focus on Becca.

43:12.855 --> 43:14.289
Becca.

43:18.393 --> 43:20.396
Hey, asshole.

43:22.964 --> 43:24.398
Is this the Uber app?

43:25.467 --> 43:27.701
- Uh, Vic?
- What?

43:27.703 --> 43:28.970
Oh, shit.

43:30.672 --> 43:32.239
Oh! What the hell
do you want?

43:32.241 --> 43:34.241
This is more about what
you want, Detective Manning.

43:34.243 --> 43:36.376
You know my name.
I'm freakin' flattered.

43:36.378 --> 43:38.145
Want another partner...
to die on your watch?

43:38.147 --> 43:40.179
- Little shit's not my partner.
- No, no, no.

43:40.181 --> 43:41.481
Don't listen to him.
He's bluffing.

43:41.483 --> 43:42.649
We're very close.

43:42.651 --> 43:44.251
No, we're not. Shoot him.

43:44.253 --> 43:46.888
I just asked him to be
the godfather of my children.

43:46.890 --> 43:48.555
Yes? You'll do it?

43:48.557 --> 43:50.123
Save your breath, Steve.

43:50.125 --> 43:52.958
We're in love.
There. It's out there. Ahh!

43:52.960 --> 43:54.828
This is how
it's gonna play out.

43:54.830 --> 43:56.329
That ugly cocksucker...

43:56.331 --> 43:57.731
You're not that ugly.

43:57.733 --> 43:59.533
...is gonna offer up a swap.

43:59.535 --> 44:01.301
You for Amo, straight up.

44:01.303 --> 44:04.204
Me for Amo, straight up?
Awesome!

44:04.206 --> 44:05.639
As soon as
we make the swap...

44:05.641 --> 44:06.773
he's gonna shoot us both.

44:06.775 --> 44:08.508
<i>Senor</i> Cortez here, too.

44:08.510 --> 44:09.943
That's bullshit, man.

44:09.945 --> 44:13.280
No, he's right actually.
Boss hates loose ends.

44:13.282 --> 44:14.415
I told you.

44:15.517 --> 44:18.218
Oh! But after I located
your partner's car here...

44:18.220 --> 44:20.020
I called in a few colleagues.

44:20.022 --> 44:22.022
How cute.
The rest of Cobra Kai.

44:22.024 --> 44:25.760
Hey, guys, why don't
we talk this out?

44:25.762 --> 44:28.495
Let's talk about
how we feel. I'll start.

44:28.497 --> 44:32.700
I feel scared when someone
has a gun to my head.

44:32.702 --> 44:34.435
How do you feel?

44:34.437 --> 44:36.069
I'm guessing
swap's off the table.

44:36.071 --> 44:37.705
I'll trade you
for a sculpture.

44:37.707 --> 44:40.108
I hear
your daughter's hot shit.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.383
What'd you say?

44:55.023 --> 44:56.726
God damn it.

45:00.898 --> 45:02.029
<i>Hold on.</i>

45:02.031 --> 45:03.831
Here we go, babies. Get on.

45:03.833 --> 45:05.065
Come on. Come on, Jolly.

45:05.067 --> 45:06.268
It's okay.
Yeah.

45:32.695 --> 45:34.731
Vic!

45:56.586 --> 45:58.121
Vic! Vic!

46:01.525 --> 46:03.624
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.

46:03.626 --> 46:04.926
I'm gonna die
at a hospital for animals.

46:04.928 --> 46:05.994
No. Hey, hey.

46:05.996 --> 46:07.161
Pull it together,
all right?

46:07.163 --> 46:08.664
I need you
to take out these lights.

46:08.666 --> 46:09.831
Level the playing field.

46:09.833 --> 46:11.100
I don't have a gun!

46:12.770 --> 46:13.869
Hey!

46:13.871 --> 46:15.103
Come on! Hey!

46:15.105 --> 46:16.604
Look, I need you to...

46:16.606 --> 46:18.239
kill those lights. Now!

46:18.241 --> 46:19.442
- Come on!
- Okay.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.646
Hey. We're gonna make it
out of this, okay?

46:24.648 --> 46:26.248
You can do it. All right?

46:26.250 --> 46:28.282
- You can do this!
- I can do this!

46:28.284 --> 46:29.550
- You ready?
- Yeah!

46:29.552 --> 46:30.553
Go!

46:52.042 --> 46:53.343
Fuck you!

46:58.984 --> 47:00.616
Hello!

47:00.618 --> 47:02.621
How many are left?

47:04.655 --> 47:05.754
Just one.

47:05.756 --> 47:06.822
I got one bullet.

47:06.824 --> 47:07.856
I got one can.

47:07.858 --> 47:10.692
If it hits somebody,
I'll know where to shoot.

47:10.694 --> 47:12.895
All right, you can do this.
Make this count.

47:12.897 --> 47:13.898
All right.

47:20.204 --> 47:22.038
I see him.

47:22.040 --> 47:24.607
Fuck! I missed!

47:28.312 --> 47:29.878
I got him!

47:29.880 --> 47:31.448
Fuck. It worked.

47:52.937 --> 47:54.103
Hey.

47:54.105 --> 47:56.673
I need you to send a text
for me that says...

47:56.675 --> 47:58.273
"He's dead."

47:58.275 --> 48:01.244
When my grandmother died
she looked so peaceful.

48:01.246 --> 48:03.445
These men
do not look peaceful.

48:03.447 --> 48:06.448
- They look murdered.
- Stu.

48:06.450 --> 48:08.920
I need Tedjo to think
I'm dead.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.790
There are no contacts.
Only one number.

48:13.792 --> 48:15.124
That's Tedjo.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.491
He gives his guys
burner phones.

48:16.493 --> 48:19.363
Sorry, I haven't used T9
in so long.

48:20.230 --> 48:21.531
Hit "send".

48:21.533 --> 48:24.202
So this Tedjo guy
killed your partner?

48:29.641 --> 48:31.941
And he oversees
a heroin pipeline...

48:31.943 --> 48:34.343
that's gonna kill
a lot more people.

48:34.345 --> 48:36.414
Teenagers. Kids.

48:37.817 --> 48:38.982
Okay.

48:38.984 --> 48:41.117
Well, heroin is so bad.

48:41.119 --> 48:44.620
And I think it's worse
when kids do it.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.525
So I hope you...

48:48.994 --> 48:49.995
Uh...

48:53.230 --> 48:55.767
Hey. Hey!

49:06.978 --> 49:08.013
Hey, Nicole!

49:08.780 --> 49:10.180
Hi, sweetie.

49:10.182 --> 49:11.882
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you're here!

49:11.884 --> 49:13.450
I wouldn't miss it.

49:13.452 --> 49:16.119
Oh, wow.
Is ol' Vic with ya?

49:16.121 --> 49:18.521
Um, you know,
I haven't seen him yet,

49:18.523 --> 49:20.256
but I'm sure he'll show up
at some point.

49:20.258 --> 49:22.693
Yeah, we'll see about that.

49:22.695 --> 49:24.194
Listen, um,
I can't stay long.

49:24.196 --> 49:27.296
But before I go,
I'm gonna take that small...

49:27.298 --> 49:31.068
scorpion sculpture off
your hands. It is stunning.

49:31.070 --> 49:32.169
Thank you.

49:32.171 --> 49:33.237
Come here.

49:33.239 --> 49:36.607
I have so loved
watching you grow up.

49:36.609 --> 49:39.010
Your father
would be so proud.

49:39.911 --> 49:41.344
Thank you.

49:41.346 --> 49:43.716
All right. Good night.

49:46.452 --> 49:48.051
Where the hell are you going?

49:48.053 --> 49:49.520
They picked up your plates.

49:49.522 --> 49:51.188
They think
you're my partner.

49:51.190 --> 49:53.289
If they can run your plates, they
sure as shit can find where you sleep!

49:53.291 --> 49:54.858
And your girlfriend.

49:54.860 --> 49:55.961
You're in this now.

49:58.664 --> 50:02.699
All I wanted to do was drive
nights, a few weekends.

50:02.701 --> 50:06.036
Save up enough money to open
a goddamn spin gym for women

50:06.038 --> 50:07.204
with my platonic friend

50:07.206 --> 50:08.438
who I happen to be
in love with.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.275
Pathetic? Sure.

50:10.277 --> 50:12.243
But it was manageable!

50:12.245 --> 50:14.480
Do you know how many people
I just watched die?

50:15.247 --> 50:16.814
Five.

50:16.816 --> 50:19.016
Technically four. You fainted
before Amo got shot in the head.

50:19.018 --> 50:20.184
Rhetorical!

50:20.186 --> 50:23.221
Rhetorical question, dude!

50:23.223 --> 50:25.656
I'm gonna need therapy
for the rest of my life.

50:25.658 --> 50:27.356
And I don't have insurance.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.325
So I'm gonna have to
get cheap student therapists

50:29.327 --> 50:31.361
who quote white guys
with Indian names

50:31.363 --> 50:33.097
and tell me
that I should meditate.

50:33.099 --> 50:36.435
I do meditate!

50:36.870 --> 50:38.136
Yes!

50:38.138 --> 50:41.205
Get angry! Own that shit!

50:41.207 --> 50:43.075
Now, come on. Let's go!

50:45.678 --> 50:48.012
What do I need to do
to make this all end?

50:48.014 --> 50:49.346
We gotta
get to Venice now.

50:49.348 --> 50:51.215
Come on. My daughter could
be in trouble. Let's go.

50:51.217 --> 50:54.453
Come on, let's go!

50:55.721 --> 50:57.090
Becca!

51:17.110 --> 51:19.978
I think we're good.
I don't think anybody followed us.

51:19.980 --> 51:21.045
How can you be sure?

51:21.047 --> 51:23.014
'Cause they would've
shot us in the street.

51:23.016 --> 51:23.882
Just keep your eyes out

51:23.884 --> 51:25.116
for anything suspicious,
all right?

51:25.118 --> 51:27.451
Yeah, we're the only
suspicious things in here.

51:27.453 --> 51:30.021
Just relax. Grab a drink.

51:30.023 --> 51:31.892
- Drink, sir?
- Be all right.

51:33.260 --> 51:34.360
Dad?

51:34.362 --> 51:35.894
- Hey!
- Hey, kid!

51:35.896 --> 51:38.730
- You actually came!
- Yeah, of course I came.

51:38.732 --> 51:40.464
- Whoa, what is that smell?
- A long story.

51:40.466 --> 51:43.601
Blood. Dog food. Vomit.

51:44.905 --> 51:46.004
Wow. Well, honestly...

51:46.006 --> 51:47.472
I'm just glad you're here.
I don't care what it is.

51:47.474 --> 51:49.341
- McHenry was just here.
- Really?

51:49.343 --> 51:50.975
Who's your friend?

51:50.977 --> 51:52.377
- Oh. Steve.
- Steve.

51:52.379 --> 51:53.678
- Stu.
- Stu.

51:53.680 --> 51:54.915
I'm Stu.

51:57.351 --> 51:58.983
Hello, Stu.

51:58.985 --> 52:00.286
- Stu.
- All right.

52:00.288 --> 52:01.887
So, what do you think?

52:01.889 --> 52:03.254
Yeah, yeah. Wow.

52:03.256 --> 52:04.355
Wow.

52:04.357 --> 52:06.324
- Right?
- Oh.

52:06.326 --> 52:07.992
Look at that.

52:07.994 --> 52:09.361
Look at the red...

52:09.363 --> 52:12.031
flowing into the blue.
It reminds me of, uh...

52:12.033 --> 52:13.132
Remember that Bricker case?

52:13.134 --> 52:15.366
That guy got shot in the head
in a swimming pool.

52:15.368 --> 52:17.168
Blood just kind of flowed out
in the waters.

52:17.170 --> 52:18.636
He was a pimp.

52:18.638 --> 52:20.605
Cool, yeah. What do you think
of the sculptures, though?

52:20.607 --> 52:23.042
Because that's what I do.
I'm a sculptor.

52:23.044 --> 52:24.109
No.

52:24.111 --> 52:25.713
- I was just saying.
- Mmm-hmm.

52:26.747 --> 52:28.680
- Let me show you this...
- I gotta, uh...

52:28.682 --> 52:29.950
I gotta drop a deuce.

52:31.985 --> 52:33.154
Vic!

52:34.454 --> 52:37.656
Nah. It's okay.
I'm used to that.

52:37.658 --> 52:40.091
So, how do you know my dad?

52:40.093 --> 52:42.194
He kidnapped me.

52:42.196 --> 52:43.863
We killed some people.

52:44.198 --> 52:45.297
Huh.

52:45.299 --> 52:46.531
<i>I'm on the fence.</i>

52:46.533 --> 52:48.767
Really?
I think she's brilliant.

52:48.769 --> 52:50.902
Her pieces
are so emotionally charged.

52:50.904 --> 52:52.670
Reminds me
of a young Richard Serra.

52:52.672 --> 52:55.506
Like if <i>Tilted Arc</i>
had a soul.

53:01.248 --> 53:03.182
I love this one.

53:03.184 --> 53:06.517
I'll take it.
Put a sold sign on that, please.

53:06.519 --> 53:10.990
It's a spin gym
for women called...

53:10.992 --> 53:13.158
"Spinster".

53:13.160 --> 53:14.926
That is a terrible name.

53:14.928 --> 53:18.364
No, no, no, I don't think
you heard. It's a spin gym.

53:18.366 --> 53:19.530
So it's like a pun.

53:19.532 --> 53:20.799
It's a play on the words.
It's whimsical.

53:20.801 --> 53:22.568
It's welcoming. It's fun.
"Come on in."

53:22.570 --> 53:25.771
A spinster is an old woman
who never found love.

53:25.773 --> 53:29.143
You might as well call
your gym "Old Hag Bikes".

53:29.377 --> 53:30.609
Huh.

53:30.611 --> 53:32.211
I'm just saying, like,
if it's your passion...

53:32.213 --> 53:34.314
- maybe find a better name.
- It's not my passion.

53:34.316 --> 53:36.216
Well, then
what is your passion?

53:36.218 --> 53:37.951
You know, I feel like

53:37.953 --> 53:39.985
LA's full of people
following their passion.

53:39.987 --> 53:42.688
We need more people to settle.
We need more settlers.

53:42.690 --> 53:44.859
You know, this country
was founded on settlers.

53:45.526 --> 53:46.859
- So...
- Hey, honey.

53:46.861 --> 53:48.495
Can I talk to you
for a second?

53:48.497 --> 53:50.198
Okay.

53:52.466 --> 53:54.700
Hey.

53:54.702 --> 53:56.304
Great work
with the sculptures, honey.

53:57.372 --> 53:58.737
Really solid stuff.

53:58.739 --> 54:00.974
Reminiscent of
a young Richard Serra.

54:00.976 --> 54:02.208
Oh, thank you.

54:02.210 --> 54:03.611
Yeah.

54:04.145 --> 54:05.210
Here.

54:05.212 --> 54:06.279
Oh, do not hand me a...

54:06.281 --> 54:07.813
- Take this.
- Jesus, Dad.

54:07.815 --> 54:09.282
- Here.
- Dad, I do not want that!

54:09.284 --> 54:12.052
There's some really bad shit
going down tonight. Okay?

54:12.054 --> 54:14.054
I checked the place out.
It's clear.

54:14.056 --> 54:15.488
But it's better safe
than sorry.

54:15.490 --> 54:16.688
- Take that.
- Oh, God.

54:16.690 --> 54:17.990
Remember how
I taught you to shoot?

54:17.992 --> 54:19.092
Yes.

54:19.094 --> 54:20.160
I hate when you do this.

54:20.162 --> 54:21.595
Anything else?

54:23.165 --> 54:25.499
So, I need to borrow
your keys to the house.

54:25.501 --> 54:29.101
Yeah, I need to get
into my old storage.

54:31.139 --> 54:32.573
Is that why you came?

54:33.375 --> 54:35.008
No.

54:35.010 --> 54:36.843
God, no.
I wanted to see your work.

54:36.845 --> 54:38.279
And make sure you were safe.

54:38.281 --> 54:40.612
But I also didn't have time
to run back to Eagle Rock.

54:40.614 --> 54:42.515
So it's a three-for-one.

54:42.517 --> 54:44.851
For a second there...

54:44.853 --> 54:47.187
I actually thought
you gave a shit about my work.

54:47.189 --> 54:48.556
Hey. This is serious.

54:48.558 --> 54:50.123
- I'm close to Tedjo.
- Yeah.

54:50.125 --> 54:52.025
You're always close
to something except for

54:52.027 --> 54:54.294
the people
who actually need you.

54:54.296 --> 54:56.162
- I'm so done.
- Hey.

54:56.164 --> 54:58.166
Nicole, wait!

55:00.802 --> 55:01.970
Keys?

55:07.275 --> 55:08.875
You know I can't see.

55:08.877 --> 55:10.977
What did you say to her, man?
You ruined her night.

55:10.979 --> 55:12.645
I don't know.
I gave her my Glock.

55:12.647 --> 55:13.847
See, that's your problem!

55:13.849 --> 55:15.115
You give people Glocks
instead of love.

55:15.117 --> 55:17.250
Suddenly the Uber driver
knows all about parenting.

55:17.252 --> 55:20.354
You're just very abrasive
and you're insensitive,

55:20.356 --> 55:22.055
and you're very scary
and you're...

55:22.057 --> 55:23.190
Oh, my God!

55:23.192 --> 55:25.559
That's exactly the kind of
thing I'm talking about!

55:25.561 --> 55:26.893
Why did you do that?

55:26.895 --> 55:29.496
To get cops here.
Just in case. Let's go.

55:29.498 --> 55:31.032
Go, go.

55:38.407 --> 55:39.973
Where is it?

55:39.975 --> 55:40.976
Box.

55:42.677 --> 55:45.945
Oh, you used to be happy.
That's adorable.

55:45.947 --> 55:48.115
You know, I would have said
you should smile more...

55:48.117 --> 55:50.351
but now that I see
this picture...

55:50.353 --> 55:52.051
good call
on quitting smiling.

55:52.053 --> 55:54.255
Your face looks really bad
when you smile.

55:54.257 --> 55:57.291
It also looks really bad
when you don't smile.

55:57.293 --> 55:58.526
You have a bad face.

55:58.528 --> 55:59.627
Oh, man.

55:59.629 --> 56:01.095
I've only got
six rounds left.

56:01.097 --> 56:02.996
Are these two other
hostages you took?

56:02.998 --> 56:04.797
- You're not helping.
- Did you just yell...

56:04.799 --> 56:07.234
"cruise ship" at them
until they took you?

56:07.236 --> 56:09.236
Look, I need more ammo.

56:09.238 --> 56:11.172
And we've only got an hour.

56:11.174 --> 56:12.439
Outside The Box.

56:12.441 --> 56:13.974
Outside the box.
Outside the box.

56:13.976 --> 56:15.775
All right, now,
let's brainstorm.

56:15.777 --> 56:17.777
We can find
a black market gun dealer.

56:17.779 --> 56:20.181
- No, it's where I work.
- Uber?

56:20.183 --> 56:21.615
Like Uber Eats?

56:21.617 --> 56:23.386
They have Uber Guns?
Uber Bullets?

56:25.556 --> 56:27.288
Oh, this is your
other horrible job?

56:27.290 --> 56:29.924
I came here once
to buy some fishing gear.

56:29.926 --> 56:31.992
Clerk was a real dick.

56:31.994 --> 56:33.928
I wanted to shoot him
in the leg,

56:33.930 --> 56:35.963
but I had self-control.

56:35.965 --> 56:38.865
Yeah, that was
probably my boss.

56:38.867 --> 56:41.268
He's the second worst guy
I've ever met.

56:41.270 --> 56:42.203
Who's the first?

56:42.205 --> 56:44.071
I'll give you a hint.

56:44.073 --> 56:45.408
It's you.

56:46.376 --> 56:47.775
All right.

56:47.777 --> 56:49.843
I thought you just needed
a couple of bullets, bud.

56:49.845 --> 56:51.278
Well, you can never be
too prepared.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.047
Yeah, but somebody
has to pay for all this shit.

56:53.049 --> 56:55.115
- Put it on my Uber tab.
- There's no tab!

56:55.117 --> 56:58.486
Uber is not a general store
in the Old West!

56:58.488 --> 57:01.058
Oh, no.

57:02.992 --> 57:06.427
Hey, Becca, I'm so, so sorry.
Uh, something came up.

57:06.429 --> 57:07.761
<i>Stu, I'm so sorry.</i>

57:07.763 --> 57:09.196
<i>I did not mean
to freak you out.</i>

57:09.198 --> 57:11.600
If you don't wanna have sex,
I understand, I'm disgusting.

57:11.602 --> 57:12.833
No, no, no.

57:12.835 --> 57:14.135
- You didn't freak me out.
- Shit.

57:14.137 --> 57:16.070
I'm definitely down to clown.

57:16.072 --> 57:17.805
- I wanna do the deed.
- <i>What?</i>

57:17.807 --> 57:18.939
And then
we're gonna have a talk.

57:18.941 --> 57:20.107
<i>You know what?
I was gonna say...</i>

57:20.109 --> 57:21.909
<i>maybe you should
not come over.</i>

57:21.911 --> 57:24.479
<i>Because, okay...
So, Byron called me...</i>

57:24.481 --> 57:26.181
<i>and he sounded
really sorry.</i>

57:26.183 --> 57:28.349
And he was like, "I should
come over and talk,"

57:28.351 --> 57:30.452
and I think
I should just hear him out.

57:30.454 --> 57:32.120
- <i>You know?</i>
- No, no, no.

57:32.122 --> 57:34.322
Do not let Byron
come over, okay?

57:34.324 --> 57:36.958
He does not deserve to be
let back into your life.

57:36.960 --> 57:38.759
Wait for me, okay?

57:38.761 --> 57:40.995
I'll be there.
Wait for me.

57:40.997 --> 57:44.466
Okay. Oh, God, this night
is so crazy for me.

57:44.468 --> 57:45.667
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

57:47.004 --> 57:48.770
Lovers' quarrel?

57:48.772 --> 57:49.904
Oh, I forgot
you're not lovers.

57:49.906 --> 57:51.305
Hey, this is good, right?

57:51.307 --> 57:52.707
Fuck off, okay?

57:52.709 --> 57:54.942
And put that back!
That's way too much stuff!

57:54.944 --> 57:56.678
Why do you
need propane tanks?

57:56.680 --> 57:58.546
Are you gonna have
a barbecue later?

57:58.548 --> 58:00.015
You have no friends!

58:00.017 --> 58:01.717
You're gonna get me fired!

58:01.719 --> 58:03.050
You weren't planning
on working

58:03.052 --> 58:04.521
in this shithole
your whole life, were you?

58:07.057 --> 58:09.557
Oh, what?
I hurt your feelings?

58:09.559 --> 58:12.193
No. Actually,
I feel bad for you.

58:12.195 --> 58:14.330
After seeing how you treat
your own daughter...

58:14.332 --> 58:17.332
it's clear that you don't
give a shit about anyone else.

58:17.334 --> 58:19.067
Wait. Are you mad at me?

58:19.069 --> 58:21.436
Or are you mad at that girl
you refuse to man up to?

58:21.438 --> 58:23.805
Oh, you're gonna give me
relationship advice?

58:23.807 --> 58:25.173
You spend more time

58:25.175 --> 58:27.175
obsessing over
your dead partner...

58:27.177 --> 58:29.411
than paying attention
to your alive daughter...

58:29.413 --> 58:32.047
who, news flash,
wants to be a part of your life.

58:32.049 --> 58:33.549
You know
what that makes you?

58:33.551 --> 58:36.218
- A good cop?
- A shitty father!

58:36.220 --> 58:37.952
All right.
You know what?

58:37.954 --> 58:40.455
You've been annoying me
all goddamn day...

58:40.457 --> 58:41.556
I've been annoying you?

58:41.558 --> 58:42.824
What?

58:42.826 --> 58:44.926
I don't need a therapy session
from Little Man Uber.

58:44.928 --> 58:47.263
Life is hard.
That's what we signed up for.

58:47.265 --> 58:49.732
And I handle my shit
like a real man.

58:49.734 --> 58:52.834
I don't bitch and moan
and whine and cry...

58:52.836 --> 58:54.002
like your pansy ass!

58:54.004 --> 58:55.771
Oh, you feel like
a real man, huh?

58:55.773 --> 58:58.574
Killing people, avenging,
kicking ass...

58:58.576 --> 59:01.243
taking names,
torturing perps.

59:01.245 --> 59:02.377
You know what?

59:02.379 --> 59:04.045
I could've called
another Uber driver earlier,

59:04.047 --> 59:05.448
and you know why I didn't?

59:05.450 --> 59:06.582
Because you don't know

59:06.584 --> 59:07.817
- how to use apps!
- No.

59:07.819 --> 59:11.487
Because I wouldn't find
one weaker than you!

59:11.489 --> 59:14.956
You're too chicken shit to
tell that girl you like her!

59:14.958 --> 59:18.193
You're too chicken shit
to stand up to me!

59:18.195 --> 59:21.898
And you're a chicken shit...

59:22.600 --> 59:25.503
who deserves zero stars.

59:26.337 --> 59:28.537
Oh, what?
What, are you getting mad?

59:28.539 --> 59:30.706
- Come on. Don't you...
- Yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

59:30.708 --> 59:33.376
- What are you gonna do about it, Steve?
- My name is Stu!

59:33.378 --> 59:34.710
Ow! Jesus! Shit!

59:41.819 --> 59:43.319
Oh, here we go.

59:43.321 --> 59:46.557
Huh? You think you're
tough shit? Come on!

59:49.361 --> 59:50.359
Tough guy, huh?

59:50.361 --> 59:53.464
Wanna face me like a man?
All right, here we go.

59:54.465 --> 59:56.733
We don't have to be violent!
We can talk!

59:56.735 --> 59:59.836
I'm not gonna sit in a kumbaya
circle jerk with you...

59:59.838 --> 01:00:02.438
and cry like a little girl!

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.972
I'm calling time out!

01:00:03.974 --> 01:00:06.909
No! No! Time out! Stop!
I said time out!

01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:08.177
Respect the time out!

01:00:08.179 --> 01:00:10.616
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Time out!

01:00:18.556 --> 01:00:20.191
You little shit!

01:00:23.362 --> 01:00:24.696
Where'd you go?

01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:27.898
Hey!

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.031
Girls are strong!

01:00:29.033 --> 01:00:30.166
They give birth to us.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.802
You should wish
you were like a woman!

01:00:31.804 --> 01:00:33.672
The future is female!

01:00:38.943 --> 01:00:40.610
Coward!
Where are you?

01:00:40.612 --> 01:00:41.944
You're the coward!

01:00:41.946 --> 01:00:44.046
You can't face
your own feelings!

01:00:44.048 --> 01:00:46.216
You remember that part
of <i>NeverEnding Story...</i>

01:00:46.218 --> 01:00:48.385
where Atreyu has to walk
through the Oracle Gates...

01:00:48.387 --> 01:00:51.220
and those giant
sphinx statue things can see

01:00:51.222 --> 01:00:53.189
a warrior's
true internal nature?

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:54.524
- What?
- And that super scary

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:55.592
knight gets vaporized...

01:00:55.594 --> 01:00:59.563
because deep down
he doesn't believe in himself?

01:00:59.565 --> 01:01:00.566
Yeah?

01:01:00.934 --> 01:01:02.531
That's you!

01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:08.740
Ha! You live your life
the way...

01:01:09.842 --> 01:01:12.275
Real men cry!

01:01:12.277 --> 01:01:17.282
Real men listen
to their feelings!

01:01:27.759 --> 01:01:28.760
Oh, no.

01:01:36.769 --> 01:01:38.668
I'll kill you!

01:01:44.276 --> 01:01:46.811
You fucked
with the wrong Uber driver!

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:57.822
- I think you broke my arm.
- Fighting is hard.

01:01:57.824 --> 01:01:59.690
You gotta have stamina.

01:01:59.692 --> 01:02:00.625
Yeah.

01:02:00.627 --> 01:02:03.293
I'm surprised you lasted
as long as you did.

01:02:03.295 --> 01:02:05.395
- That's 'cause I was winning.
- You were not.

01:02:05.397 --> 01:02:07.965
- It was fun. I totally won.
- I was kicking your ass.

01:02:07.967 --> 01:02:09.299
I won.

01:02:09.301 --> 01:02:12.970
Couple of homeless guys
humping in my store, huh?

01:02:12.972 --> 01:02:15.572
Little squat and fuck?

01:02:15.574 --> 01:02:17.742
Stuber, that you?

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:23.548
"Stuber."

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.984
Oh, that's great,
'cause you drive an Uber.

01:02:25.986 --> 01:02:27.450
That's a great pun.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.654
Who the hell are you?
And why are you so huge?

01:02:29.656 --> 01:02:32.557
Jesus, what are you benching?
Like, 310, 350?

01:02:32.559 --> 01:02:33.691
Easy, kid.

01:02:33.693 --> 01:02:35.726
Just put the crossbow down.
We'll get out of your hair.

01:02:35.728 --> 01:02:37.061
Jesus, Stuber!

01:02:37.063 --> 01:02:39.429
What the hell did you and your
gigolo friend do to my store?

01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:41.532
It's your dad's store.

01:02:41.534 --> 01:02:43.467
He's a cop. He's working
an important case.

01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:44.602
Case?

01:02:44.604 --> 01:02:46.771
- Is that what you call your butt?
- Look, pal.

01:02:46.773 --> 01:02:47.973
We're in a hurry.

01:02:47.975 --> 01:02:49.240
You got another
sporting goods store

01:02:49.242 --> 01:02:51.408
you gotta fuck in
or something?

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:53.411
Listen, do you know
what this is?

01:02:53.413 --> 01:02:54.512
- Huh.
- That's blood.

01:02:54.514 --> 01:02:55.680
It is.

01:02:55.682 --> 01:02:58.416
I've done things tonight
you would not believe.

01:02:58.418 --> 01:02:59.317
Oh, yeah?

01:02:59.319 --> 01:03:01.452
I signed a lease
on a spin gym.

01:03:01.454 --> 01:03:02.453
Weird.

01:03:02.455 --> 01:03:04.989
I provided emotional support
to a male stripper.

01:03:04.991 --> 01:03:06.524
You're saying these things
like they're scary.

01:03:06.526 --> 01:03:09.093
- I shot a man in cold blood.
- Yeah.

01:03:09.095 --> 01:03:11.195
I watched him die.

01:03:11.197 --> 01:03:15.266
From someone else's bullet,
but I loosened him up.

01:03:15.268 --> 01:03:16.601
Yeah, right, Stuber.

01:03:16.603 --> 01:03:17.604
Hey.

01:03:18.871 --> 01:03:20.239
His name is Stu.

01:03:26.046 --> 01:03:28.114
My name is Stu.

01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:31.384
How do you do?

01:03:32.452 --> 01:03:34.653
He's fucking crazy.

01:03:34.655 --> 01:03:36.220
Yeah.

01:03:40.894 --> 01:03:42.228
Easy, Stu.

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:46.834
I quit.

01:03:47.668 --> 01:03:48.667
And I'm telling your dad

01:03:48.669 --> 01:03:51.003
you masturbate
in the handicap stall.

01:03:51.005 --> 01:03:52.338
Oh, don't do that.

01:03:53.107 --> 01:03:54.773
I'll just use a regular stall.

01:03:54.775 --> 01:03:56.443
You're pathetic.

01:03:59.813 --> 01:04:01.348
Stu, hold on.

01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:04.183
You're my best friend, man.

01:04:06.487 --> 01:04:07.351
What?

01:04:07.353 --> 01:04:11.390
Yeah. The back and forth...

01:04:11.392 --> 01:04:14.325
the razzing, you and me.

01:04:14.327 --> 01:04:16.595
It's the best part
about this whole stupid job.

01:04:16.597 --> 01:04:18.130
It's, like,
the worst part for me.

01:04:18.132 --> 01:04:19.531
Do you have any idea
what it's like...

01:04:19.533 --> 01:04:21.633
to know the only reason
you even have a job

01:04:21.635 --> 01:04:23.835
is because
your dad owns this place?

01:04:23.837 --> 01:04:25.738
And you're balding? Fuck.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.239
I honestly don't see
any hair loss on you.

01:04:28.241 --> 01:04:30.742
Yeah, you should see
my drain when I shower.

01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:31.643
Yeah, but that's shedding.

01:04:31.645 --> 01:04:32.911
That's normal.
Everyone has that.

01:04:32.913 --> 01:04:36.350
- Plus your follicles...
- Hey, Stu, we gotta go.

01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:39.318
Stu, wait.

01:04:42.389 --> 01:04:44.057
You really don't think
I'm losing hair?

01:04:44.059 --> 01:04:45.925
If you are...

01:04:45.927 --> 01:04:47.662
it's very subtle.

01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:51.965
Thanks, Stu.

01:04:54.102 --> 01:04:56.370
I'll get that.

01:05:00.374 --> 01:05:01.774
<i>Low battery charge.</i>

01:05:01.776 --> 01:05:02.974
<i>Press button to check.</i>

01:05:02.976 --> 01:05:05.544
Ah, shit. I'm running out of power.
I gotta recharge.

01:05:05.546 --> 01:05:06.678
No, we don't have time.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.014
The salvage yard
is not far anyway.

01:05:08.016 --> 01:05:11.951
Well, looks like we're at
the end of our road, huh?

01:05:11.953 --> 01:05:13.119
Not literally.

01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:14.553
I'll drop you up the road.

01:05:14.555 --> 01:05:15.889
This was...

01:05:16.824 --> 01:05:17.957
It wasn't fun.

01:05:17.959 --> 01:05:20.960
You can't drop me off.
I need you to come with me.

01:05:20.962 --> 01:05:22.095
No, no, no.

01:05:22.097 --> 01:05:23.963
You're a cop.
I'm a civilian.

01:05:23.965 --> 01:05:27.432
You're built for justice.
I'm built for brunch.

01:05:27.434 --> 01:05:31.170
I do civilian things.
I like walks.

01:05:31.172 --> 01:05:33.439
And I really wanna get
into brewing beer.

01:05:33.441 --> 01:05:36.176
Like IPAs,
maybe a nice <i>Hefeweizen.</i>

01:05:36.178 --> 01:05:39.279
But I cannot do that
if I'm dead.

01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:41.448
All right.

01:05:42.016 --> 01:05:43.785
I'll do it myself.

01:05:47.822 --> 01:05:48.855
Listen...

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:51.456
I know you're this,
like, Steven Seagal badass

01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:52.961
who doesn't need shit
from anyone.

01:05:54.529 --> 01:05:57.432
Your dad was a dick
to leave you in the desert.

01:05:58.099 --> 01:05:59.599
Sometimes people need help,

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:02.971
and it is not a sign of
weakness to ask for it.

01:06:04.139 --> 01:06:06.341
Call for backup.

01:06:08.777 --> 01:06:11.879
I don't know where Vic is.
How would I know?

01:06:16.718 --> 01:06:17.650
Vic?

01:06:17.652 --> 01:06:19.385
I know you think I'm the boy
who cried Tedjo,

01:06:19.387 --> 01:06:21.188
but I got the drop location.

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:23.056
<i>I know
this went to the feds...</i>

01:06:23.058 --> 01:06:25.460
but I really need backup.

01:06:25.761 --> 01:06:26.826
Okay.

01:06:26.828 --> 01:06:27.760
Really?

01:06:27.762 --> 01:06:29.862
You're a pain in my ass,
but I trust you.

01:06:29.864 --> 01:06:31.798
<i>All right, they're making
a deal in Inglewood.</i>

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.100
<i>Watseka Salvage.</i>

01:06:33.102 --> 01:06:34.634
The meet goes down
in half an hour.

01:06:34.636 --> 01:06:36.737
Send in the cavalry.
Call in SWAT.

01:06:36.739 --> 01:06:39.438
- Okay. You got it, Vic.
- <i>And, Captain...</i>

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.275
thanks for not
giving up on me.

01:06:41.277 --> 01:06:42.577
<i>You bet.</i>

01:06:44.013 --> 01:06:45.813
See? Didn't that feel good?

01:06:45.815 --> 01:06:48.517
You asked for help
and the sky didn't fall.

01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:58.324
That's technically
not the sky.

01:06:58.326 --> 01:07:00.727
That's the sky's tears.

01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:03.729
It's tears of joy 'cause
the sky is proud of you.

01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:06.033
Please shut up.

01:07:06.035 --> 01:07:08.637
Well, no worries.

01:07:09.038 --> 01:07:10.371
I found Vic.

01:07:10.606 --> 01:07:12.240
Great.

01:07:12.242 --> 01:07:13.709
No!

01:07:16.711 --> 01:07:18.477
Can you tell me
what you see?

01:07:18.479 --> 01:07:20.948
Three black Lexuses.

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:22.883
Lexi? Lexuses?

01:07:22.885 --> 01:07:24.084
Lexi.

01:07:24.086 --> 01:07:25.452
Yeah. They're waiting
for Tedjo.

01:07:25.454 --> 01:07:26.954
You should
get out of here, man.

01:07:26.956 --> 01:07:28.656
Things are gonna get hairy.

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:30.724
Are you sure you're okay?

01:07:30.726 --> 01:07:33.493
Yeah, you should go.
Look, cavalry's on the way...

01:07:33.495 --> 01:07:35.230
SWAT, the whole deal.

01:07:35.232 --> 01:07:36.799
Go on, call that girl.

01:07:38.033 --> 01:07:39.034
Okay.

01:07:42.805 --> 01:07:43.873
Goodbye.

01:07:45.674 --> 01:07:46.974
Come on.

01:07:46.976 --> 01:07:49.310
- What are you doing?
- Get over here, big guy.

01:07:49.312 --> 01:07:50.744
After all the horrors
we've been through...

01:07:50.746 --> 01:07:52.312
we've earned this.
Come on.

01:07:52.314 --> 01:07:54.181
- Save it for a tree, bud.
- Hey.

01:07:54.183 --> 01:07:56.450
Men can hug. Okay?

01:07:56.452 --> 01:07:58.119
And I know
deep inside that...

01:07:58.121 --> 01:08:00.288
needlessly muscular body...

01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:03.422
is the biggest muscle of all,
your heart.

01:08:03.424 --> 01:08:05.561
- And I want to hug that heart.
- Stu!

01:08:11.902 --> 01:08:13.770
Thank you for driving.

01:08:39.595 --> 01:08:43.563
<i>Oh, my God. Jesus.
Stu, what happened to you?</i>

01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:44.966
Becca, I have to
tell you something.

01:08:44.968 --> 01:08:46.200
<i>Okay, then...</i>

01:08:46.202 --> 01:08:47.835
come over, Stu.

01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:50.371
- <i>And we can...</i>
- Becca, I am in love with you.

01:08:50.372 --> 01:08:53.274
And I have been
since the moment we met.

01:08:53.276 --> 01:08:54.573
You date assholes.

01:08:54.576 --> 01:08:56.544
I'm sorry, but you do.

01:08:56.546 --> 01:08:58.912
And I wait on the sidelines,
and I come when you call...

01:08:58.915 --> 01:09:01.015
and I encourage you and I make
your dreams my dreams...

01:09:01.017 --> 01:09:03.151
and I guess I've just been
hoping that someday

01:09:03.153 --> 01:09:05.551
you would look at me
and see me differently.

01:09:05.554 --> 01:09:07.087
<i>And something would click!</i>

01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:08.356
What the...

01:09:08.358 --> 01:09:11.559
Uh, I'm sorry,
this is a little unfair. Um...

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.859
<i>So you were too afraid
to tell me</i>

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:15.662
<i>how you felt
and now it's my fault...</i>

01:09:15.663 --> 01:09:17.231
<i>for not clicking?</i>

01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:19.435
No, no, no.
You're right.

01:09:19.437 --> 01:09:21.738
It's not your fault,
it's my fault.

01:09:22.839 --> 01:09:24.671
I just can't do this anymore.

01:09:24.674 --> 01:09:26.506
I can't have
casual sex with you

01:09:26.508 --> 01:09:28.910
and pretend like
I don't feel anything.

01:09:28.912 --> 01:09:31.145
I can't open
a business with you

01:09:31.147 --> 01:09:35.017
and hope that that will
make you fall in love with me.

01:09:35.019 --> 01:09:36.051
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

01:09:36.053 --> 01:09:38.786
<i>I guess I'll find
the other half somehow.</i>

01:09:38.787 --> 01:09:41.522
No, no.
Keep my money, seriously.

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:43.057
I know it's gonna be
very successful

01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:46.295
and as an investor
I'll become super wealthy.

01:09:46.296 --> 01:09:48.229
But it's your dream,
not mine.

01:09:48.232 --> 01:09:49.596
<i>Wait, what?</i>

01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:52.836
<i>But I don't wanna lose you.
Can we still be friends?</i>

01:09:54.037 --> 01:09:55.770
No.

01:09:55.772 --> 01:09:58.809
No. Because I am in love
with you.

01:10:00.478 --> 01:10:02.610
I'm gonna go.

01:10:02.612 --> 01:10:03.945
I'll give you a call
when I'm not

01:10:03.947 --> 01:10:05.782
waiting for that click
anymore.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:08.350
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.

01:10:08.352 --> 01:10:09.552
<i>Bye.</i>

01:10:23.367 --> 01:10:26.069
That is a weak-ass cavalry.

01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:31.507
Are they here?

01:10:31.509 --> 01:10:32.608
Coming in right here.

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:34.109
- Get the shit.
- Bring 'em.

01:10:34.111 --> 01:10:36.612
Oh, got your ass.

01:10:38.282 --> 01:10:39.649
Fuck.

01:10:44.355 --> 01:10:45.821
- <i>Nikki?</i>
- Dad!

01:10:45.823 --> 01:10:48.391
Hey, I'm still pissed off
at you...

01:10:48.393 --> 01:10:49.824
<i>but my show is over.</i>

01:10:49.826 --> 01:10:50.993
<i>Um, I'm alive
and I definitely</i>

01:10:50.995 --> 01:10:52.627
<i>don't need
this gun anymore, so...</i>

01:10:52.629 --> 01:10:54.263
Yeah, Nikki,
I gotta call you back.

01:10:54.265 --> 01:10:55.431
McHenry's pulling up.

01:10:55.433 --> 01:10:56.598
<i>McHenry?</i>

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.068
She was acting
really weird tonight.

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.636
<i>Like, really huggy.</i>

01:11:00.638 --> 01:11:02.971
- Yeah, something's not right.
- <i>Dad.</i>

01:11:02.973 --> 01:11:04.339
What's going on?
Where are you?

01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:05.974
<i>I gotta go.</i>

01:11:05.976 --> 01:11:07.309
Dad?

01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:08.744
What's going on?

01:11:08.746 --> 01:11:10.480
Where are the feds?

01:11:10.482 --> 01:11:12.184
I didn't think
we needed 'em.

01:11:14.651 --> 01:11:16.952
The feds took over
this investigation...

01:11:16.954 --> 01:11:19.855
because they're worried
about a mole in the force.

01:11:19.857 --> 01:11:23.126
They know someone inside
is on Tedjo's payroll.

01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:24.626
Now drop that rifle!

01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:26.795
Drop it!

01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:28.565
I'm not a freaking mole.

01:11:28.567 --> 01:11:30.032
You know that.

01:11:30.034 --> 01:11:31.203
Yeah.

01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:33.071
I know, Vic.

01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:36.341
No.

01:11:39.076 --> 01:11:40.343
You and Tedjo.

01:11:40.345 --> 01:11:41.478
The whole time.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.879
I knew all I had to give you
was one lead

01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:45.582
and you'd track him
like a dog.

01:11:45.584 --> 01:11:47.016
<i>Leon, are you sure?</i>

01:11:47.018 --> 01:11:48.785
That's your fucking intel,
all right, Vic?

01:11:48.787 --> 01:11:50.119
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:11:50.121 --> 01:11:52.355
Koreatown.
Cordova and Vermont.

01:11:52.357 --> 01:11:54.692
<i>All right, Leon, where's...</i>

01:12:00.632 --> 01:12:02.664
And you got
your bloody footprints

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.467
all over Leon's murder scene.

01:12:04.469 --> 01:12:06.970
And I'm on surveillance
footage at the Sizzle Room.

01:12:06.972 --> 01:12:09.272
McHENRY: <i>Tedjo's distribution
center, you mean.</i>

01:12:09.274 --> 01:12:10.907
But then you got greedy...

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:14.042
and you got yourself killed
in a shoot-out during a drop.

01:12:14.044 --> 01:12:15.846
In fact, it happened
right over there.

01:12:17.648 --> 01:12:19.048
This whole drop's
a setup?

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:21.251
McHENRY: No, the drop's
happening tonight.

01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:24.754
And next week, now that
the feds aren't up our ass.

01:12:24.756 --> 01:12:27.524
And you tipped off Tedjo.

01:12:27.526 --> 01:12:30.326
And you got Morris killed,
you rat!

01:12:30.328 --> 01:12:33.129
They were supposed to be gone
before you guys arrived.

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:34.532
Like I said, Vic...

01:12:34.534 --> 01:12:36.267
Morris wasn't your fault.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:38.568
Wish you were the kind of guy
that could have cashed in too.

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:39.768
Hold on, now. Just wait.

01:12:48.247 --> 01:12:49.845
Silent but deadly.

01:12:49.847 --> 01:12:51.781
What the hell
are you talking...

01:12:53.818 --> 01:12:56.320
Yes!

01:12:56.322 --> 01:12:57.921
- I'm sorry.
- Yes!

01:12:57.923 --> 01:13:00.324
- So sorry! Oh, God!
- Stu!

01:13:00.326 --> 01:13:02.992
Vic! Vic!

01:13:02.994 --> 01:13:04.595
Yes! Yes!

01:13:04.597 --> 01:13:05.663
Let's go!

01:13:05.665 --> 01:13:06.863
Go! Go!

01:13:06.865 --> 01:13:08.199
I just hit someone
with my car!

01:13:08.201 --> 01:13:09.200
She'll live.

01:13:09.202 --> 01:13:11.101
- You hit a crooked cop.
- That was a cop?

01:13:11.103 --> 01:13:12.469
Oh, my God.
Are you the bad guy?

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:13.703
I'm not the bad guy.

01:13:13.705 --> 01:13:14.906
Come on!

01:13:17.042 --> 01:13:18.708
Don't let him
out of here!

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:19.842
I'm a henchman.

01:13:19.844 --> 01:13:21.612
I've been aiding
and abetting a bad guy.

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:23.013
You Stockholm-syndromed me.

01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:24.148
- That's not cool.
- You saved my ass.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.848
You saved my ass, kid.
You got brass balls.

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:27.551
- Don't talk about my balls.
- It's me and you.

01:13:27.553 --> 01:13:28.619
Leave my balls out of it.

01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:30.254
We're a team, buddy.
Make a U-turn.

01:13:30.256 --> 01:13:31.222
Very funny.

01:13:31.224 --> 01:13:32.923
I'm not letting Tedjo
get away. Not again.

01:13:32.925 --> 01:13:35.459
I'm driving, and we're going
where I say we go.

01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:36.695
- Stu, turn around!
- No! Let go!

01:13:36.697 --> 01:13:37.794
- Let go!
- God damn it...

01:13:37.796 --> 01:13:39.195
Stu, turn around!

01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:40.497
This is my car!

01:13:43.835 --> 01:13:45.302
Fuck, this is a lease!

01:13:45.304 --> 01:13:46.537
Will you quit bitching?

01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:48.138
Now, punch it!

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.409
You know what?

01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:52.775
Yeah!

01:13:52.777 --> 01:13:54.612
You're a badass!

01:13:54.614 --> 01:13:55.879
- Yeah!
- There she is!

01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:57.014
Go, Stu, go!

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.882
- There she is!
- Yeah! Go!

01:13:58.884 --> 01:13:59.950
Get me closer!

01:13:59.952 --> 01:14:01.851
What? No, I'm trying
to get away!

01:14:01.853 --> 01:14:04.423
- Get me closer! Get me closer!
- No! No! No!

01:14:06.392 --> 01:14:07.791
Oh, you're scaring me, Stu.

01:14:07.793 --> 01:14:09.093
And I love it!

01:14:09.095 --> 01:14:11.296
I spent my time driving
assholes like you around.

01:14:11.298 --> 01:14:12.464
Got pretty good at it.

01:14:12.466 --> 01:14:13.398
And I love Styx!

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.965
You had me pegged
from the start, dude.

01:14:14.967 --> 01:14:16.333
I'm gonna turn it up.

01:14:16.335 --> 01:14:17.401
Here we go!

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:24.775
Come on!

01:14:36.523 --> 01:14:37.621
Come on, come on, come on.

01:14:37.623 --> 01:14:38.858
September 1st.

01:14:40.826 --> 01:14:42.059
Stu's the driver?

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:43.695
"Ride still in progress"?

01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:44.862
<i>I got an idea!</i>

01:14:44.864 --> 01:14:46.864
I'm gonna throw this
propane tank at them.

01:14:46.866 --> 01:14:48.466
You shoot it.
It'll blow up their car!

01:14:48.468 --> 01:14:49.833
This isn't freakin' <i>Jaws!</i>

01:14:49.835 --> 01:14:52.338
Exactly! Just like <i>Jaws.</i>
It's gonna work. Ready?

01:14:54.708 --> 01:14:56.408
One, two...

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.511
go!

01:15:05.719 --> 01:15:06.917
Okay, they were bad men.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.153
They made bad choices...

01:15:08.155 --> 01:15:09.856
and it was their fault,
not mine.

01:15:10.657 --> 01:15:11.892
Faster!

01:15:20.233 --> 01:15:21.099
Hey!

01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:23.503
Hey! Hey, I can see!
I can see!

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:28.740
Come on, come on!
Faster!

01:15:37.883 --> 01:15:41.219
- You got 'em! Yes!
- I got 'em! Got 'em! Yes!

01:15:41.221 --> 01:15:42.354
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:15:42.356 --> 01:15:43.756
<i>Low battery charge.</i>

01:15:43.758 --> 01:15:44.889
- Damn.
- <i>Press button to check.</i>

01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:46.594
- No, no, no!
- I got 'em.

01:15:48.563 --> 01:15:50.894
- What's that beeping?
- No! Please, please, please.

01:15:50.896 --> 01:15:52.097
- What's that beeping?
- Come on, come on.

01:15:52.099 --> 01:15:56.000
Come on, come on, come on.

01:15:56.002 --> 01:15:57.503
What the hell's
going on?

01:15:57.505 --> 01:15:59.206
We're out of juice.

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.740
Well, switch to gas!

01:16:01.742 --> 01:16:04.476
There's no gas!
It's an electric car!

01:16:04.478 --> 01:16:09.314
You got an electric car
that doesn't use gas?

01:16:09.316 --> 01:16:11.983
Everybody who buys
an electric car

01:16:11.985 --> 01:16:13.185
has a car
that doesn't use gas.

01:16:13.187 --> 01:16:15.053
That's what
an electric car is.

01:16:15.055 --> 01:16:16.254
Well, that shit attitude
is not

01:16:16.256 --> 01:16:17.723
gonna help us
out of this situation.

01:16:17.725 --> 01:16:19.023
No attitude will help.

01:16:19.025 --> 01:16:20.526
Oh, no!

01:16:20.528 --> 01:16:22.261
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:16:23.331 --> 01:16:24.630
All right,
I'm taking out his tires.

01:16:24.632 --> 01:16:25.632
Okay.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:31.672
- Shit! That never works.
- Shit.

01:16:52.794 --> 01:16:54.529
Oh, my God!

01:16:55.096 --> 01:16:55.960
Vic!

01:16:55.962 --> 01:16:57.831
Vic, you okay?

01:16:57.833 --> 01:17:00.299
You should have worn
a seatbelt. Oh, God.

01:17:00.301 --> 01:17:01.267
Really? Now?

01:17:01.269 --> 01:17:02.601
Sorry.
I'll bring it up later.

01:17:02.603 --> 01:17:04.037
Shit.

01:17:07.675 --> 01:17:09.241
We'll go up there.

01:17:15.683 --> 01:17:16.684
Watch it.

01:17:21.556 --> 01:17:22.591
I'm blind again!

01:17:25.526 --> 01:17:26.892
Give me your phone.

01:17:26.894 --> 01:17:28.262
It must have fallen out
in the crash.

01:17:31.499 --> 01:17:32.699
All right.

01:17:32.701 --> 01:17:34.001
Come on, hurry!

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.408
Go, go!

01:17:42.945 --> 01:17:44.811
I got this.

01:17:44.813 --> 01:17:49.082
Hello, operator? We need help.
Someone's trying to murder us!

01:17:49.084 --> 01:17:50.416
<i>Hello, operator?
We need help.</i>

01:17:50.418 --> 01:17:53.720
<i>Someone's trying
to murder us! Shit.</i>

01:17:53.722 --> 01:17:55.054
- Fuck!
- <i>Fuck!</i>

01:17:55.056 --> 01:17:56.425
Okay, okay.

01:17:57.024 --> 01:17:58.227
Come on.

01:18:05.366 --> 01:18:06.666
Here.

01:18:06.668 --> 01:18:08.368
Please, no.

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:09.736
No, no, no.
We're the good guys.

01:18:09.738 --> 01:18:11.605
He's a cop. I'm with Uber.

01:18:11.607 --> 01:18:12.806
Go, go, go.

01:18:12.808 --> 01:18:15.276
Get down, get down.
Get down.

01:18:19.381 --> 01:18:20.981
Does anyone have a phone?

01:18:20.983 --> 01:18:22.082
Thank you.

01:18:22.084 --> 01:18:23.416
I'm gonna call 911.

01:18:23.418 --> 01:18:24.718
No! No cops.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.986
Right.

01:18:25.988 --> 01:18:28.389
- There's no telling who else is on his payroll.
- Right.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.159
Okay. We just gotta get out

01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:34.394
of here and we're home free.

01:18:34.396 --> 01:18:36.697
I got us an UberSUV,
so we can all pile in.

01:18:36.699 --> 01:18:40.333
Tariq, 4.8 stars, is gonna
be here in three minutes.

01:18:40.335 --> 01:18:41.635
Six minutes!

01:18:41.637 --> 01:18:42.736
He took a right!

01:18:42.738 --> 01:18:43.837
You're going
the wrong way, Tariq!

01:18:43.839 --> 01:18:45.006
What are you doing, dude?

01:18:45.008 --> 01:18:47.340
Everyone, pull out
your phones.

01:18:47.342 --> 01:18:48.709
Call Uber.

01:18:48.711 --> 01:18:49.843
Uber. Uber.

01:18:49.845 --> 01:18:51.611
Ride-share. Ride-share.

01:18:51.613 --> 01:18:54.249
Yeah, dude.
We know what Uber is.

01:18:57.754 --> 01:18:58.653
What are you doing?

01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:00.454
I'm gonna Uber us
out of here myself.

01:19:00.456 --> 01:19:02.087
No, he's gonna be here
in four minutes, dude.

01:19:02.089 --> 01:19:03.155
He's on the...

01:19:03.157 --> 01:19:04.925
Fuck, he took another right!

01:19:04.927 --> 01:19:07.663
How does he have 4.8 stars?

01:19:13.068 --> 01:19:14.536
Huh?

01:19:26.248 --> 01:19:27.783
Who parked a boat here?

01:19:32.454 --> 01:19:33.320
Come on!

01:19:33.322 --> 01:19:34.922
Come on, we gotta go!
Let's go.

01:19:41.597 --> 01:19:42.599
Hey!

01:19:43.365 --> 01:19:45.733
- Fuck!
- Damn.

01:19:45.735 --> 01:19:47.635
Wait.

01:19:47.637 --> 01:19:49.235
Wait.

01:19:49.237 --> 01:19:50.905
He has nothing
to do with this.

01:19:50.907 --> 01:19:52.974
All right?
Just let him go.

01:19:52.976 --> 01:19:55.175
He's a good man.
I forced him to be here.

01:19:55.177 --> 01:19:56.711
He's done nothing to you.

01:19:58.915 --> 01:20:00.082
What the fuck?

01:20:00.084 --> 01:20:01.683
I was going for his face.

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:10.291
That's the feds.

01:20:10.293 --> 01:20:12.393
It's over, Tedjo.
Put the gun down.

01:20:12.395 --> 01:20:14.028
Yeah, we called Agent Tariq.

01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:16.599
One of the top agents.
Five stars.

01:20:17.433 --> 01:20:19.300
He brought
his undercover crew with him.

01:20:19.302 --> 01:20:22.770
Top of his class at Quantico.
He's Dark Ops.

01:20:22.772 --> 01:20:25.806
<i>Los Angeles</i> as well.

01:20:25.808 --> 01:20:28.241
Tariq, don't shoot him!
Don't do it! Don't do it.

01:20:28.243 --> 01:20:29.510
- Don't shoot!
- Don't do it!

01:20:29.512 --> 01:20:32.446
You assholes called multiple
Ubers at the same time?

01:20:32.448 --> 01:20:33.681
So uncool!

01:20:33.683 --> 01:20:35.218
God damn it.

01:20:38.554 --> 01:20:40.456
We're fucked.

01:20:48.197 --> 01:20:49.397
- Vic?
- Stu!

01:20:49.399 --> 01:20:50.765
- Vic?
- Get the gun!

01:20:50.767 --> 01:20:52.299
Grab the gun!

01:20:52.301 --> 01:20:54.301
Watch out for his fists!

01:20:57.908 --> 01:20:59.710
Stu, get the gun!

01:21:03.713 --> 01:21:05.179
Stop! Stop it!

01:21:05.181 --> 01:21:06.449
I'm gonna shoot you!

01:21:06.917 --> 01:21:07.918
Stop!

01:21:09.887 --> 01:21:11.855
Stop it! Stop!

01:21:14.158 --> 01:21:16.190
Stu, take the shot!
Shoot!

01:21:16.192 --> 01:21:18.225
- Just defeat him!
- Come on!

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:20.831
He's so little!

01:21:27.403 --> 01:21:29.640
- Stop it!
- Stu!

01:21:29.873 --> 01:21:30.874
Stu!

01:21:32.308 --> 01:21:33.909
Take the shot, Stu!

01:21:33.911 --> 01:21:35.877
- Shoot!
- Come on!

01:21:39.382 --> 01:21:41.149
Stu, take the shot!

01:21:57.035 --> 01:21:58.635
Back away from my dad!

01:21:59.703 --> 01:22:01.772
- Nicole?
- Back away from him!

01:22:03.239 --> 01:22:05.040
Back away!

01:22:05.042 --> 01:22:06.541
Yes!

01:22:06.543 --> 01:22:08.412
Dad, come on.
Get up, get up!

01:22:09.214 --> 01:22:11.013
Watch out. Watch out!

01:22:11.015 --> 01:22:13.014
Let him go. Let him go.

01:22:14.118 --> 01:22:15.719
No! No!

01:22:18.956 --> 01:22:20.555
No.

01:22:20.557 --> 01:22:23.460
I'm going to take
everything from you.

01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:26.730
No.

01:22:40.644 --> 01:22:43.311
I will kill you...

01:22:43.313 --> 01:22:44.947
if you touch my daughter!

01:22:44.949 --> 01:22:46.849
Dad, stop!

01:22:46.851 --> 01:22:47.852
Dad, don't!

01:22:49.254 --> 01:22:51.220
Dad, fucking stop!

01:22:54.259 --> 01:22:56.659
Dad, it's over.

01:22:56.661 --> 01:22:57.593
That's it.

01:22:57.595 --> 01:22:59.195
- Get down!
- Don't move!

01:22:59.197 --> 01:23:00.264
Stay down.

01:23:04.002 --> 01:23:05.067
Come on, Dad.

01:23:05.069 --> 01:23:06.401
On your stomach!

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:08.437
On your stomach! Roll over!

01:23:08.439 --> 01:23:09.939
Roll over.

01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:11.774
On your stomach, now!

01:23:11.776 --> 01:23:13.978
- Hands to your side.
- Cuff him.

01:23:17.314 --> 01:23:18.446
Are you all right?

01:23:18.448 --> 01:23:19.916
I got shot.

01:23:19.918 --> 01:23:23.619
I got shot right where
the blood is coming from.

01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:25.890
<i>Gonna send
a helicopter to you.</i>

01:23:33.031 --> 01:23:35.400
No!

01:23:35.935 --> 01:23:37.632
It was a lease!

01:23:37.634 --> 01:23:42.238
There's no gasoline!
How would it catch fire?

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.042
The propane!

01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:54.951
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, kid.

01:23:54.953 --> 01:23:57.420
- How you feeling?
- I can see.

01:23:57.422 --> 01:23:58.989
Well, that's good.

01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:01.389
- You look great.
- Thanks.

01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:03.595
I look like
I've been up all night.

01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:05.130
Hey.

01:24:06.397 --> 01:24:07.866
I'm really sorry.

01:24:09.134 --> 01:24:10.868
It's okay.

01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:12.471
No, it's not.

01:24:13.705 --> 01:24:17.840
I'm gonna be better, okay?
I promise.

01:24:17.842 --> 01:24:20.445
We'll both be better,
how about that?

01:24:22.648 --> 01:24:24.214
Thank you
for taking care of him.

01:24:24.216 --> 01:24:25.815
I didn't want to.

01:24:25.817 --> 01:24:27.683
He made me.

01:24:27.685 --> 01:24:30.586
And for literally
taking a bullet for me.

01:24:30.588 --> 01:24:32.858
Yeah, I guess
that was pretty heroic, huh?

01:24:33.525 --> 01:24:35.392
If I do get a medal,

01:24:35.394 --> 01:24:37.426
I'm gonna donate it
to an orphanage.

01:24:37.428 --> 01:24:39.629
Just to inspire
those little shits.

01:24:39.631 --> 01:24:41.798
We recovered your phones
from the wreckage.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.902
Yes!

01:24:43.302 --> 01:24:44.501
Thank you.

01:24:44.503 --> 01:24:46.103
Thank you.

01:24:46.105 --> 01:24:47.905
- Good job.
- Thanks.

01:24:47.907 --> 01:24:48.907
Thank you.

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.246
Surge pricing, baby!

01:24:58.285 --> 01:25:01.051
Mother frigger.

01:25:01.053 --> 01:25:02.685
No tip?

01:25:02.687 --> 01:25:04.955
That's an interesting choice.

01:25:13.365 --> 01:25:14.867
Five stars.

01:25:16.434 --> 01:25:18.103
Thank you.

01:25:18.837 --> 01:25:20.204
Uh...

01:25:20.206 --> 01:25:23.740
So, I didn't think you were
gonna give me five stars...

01:25:23.742 --> 01:25:26.777
so I already
rated you three stars.

01:25:26.779 --> 01:25:30.981
But given the circumstances,
I feel that's very generous.

01:25:30.983 --> 01:25:32.152
Hey.

01:25:34.988 --> 01:25:37.020
Thank you.

01:25:37.022 --> 01:25:38.691
For saving her.

01:25:43.964 --> 01:25:45.129
Thank you.

01:25:58.244 --> 01:26:00.777
Do you need a tissue
for those tears?

01:26:00.779 --> 01:26:02.479
No, that's...

01:26:02.481 --> 01:26:04.717
There must be some hot sauce
in your hair.

01:26:05.818 --> 01:26:06.985
Must be.

01:26:06.987 --> 01:26:10.221
You think about that
Nick Lachey-looking fuck...

01:26:10.223 --> 01:26:11.489
who betrayed you.

01:26:11.491 --> 01:26:13.523
I know who he is. Kevin.

01:26:13.525 --> 01:26:16.060
Accountant. Worthless.
Put it on the bike.

01:26:16.062 --> 01:26:20.298
On top of that hill is frose,
six Midol, and alimony!

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.469
You get half of...

01:26:44.557 --> 01:26:46.891
- Hey. Here.
- Hey, Howard. Thank you.

01:26:46.893 --> 01:26:48.595
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:26:49.628 --> 01:26:54.034
Hey, get up here.
Look at that. Look at that.

01:26:54.567 --> 01:26:57.003
All right, buddy.

01:26:57.837 --> 01:27:01.939
Come on.
Let's go see Nicole.

01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:04.677
Let's go see Nicole.
Come on.

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:12.550
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- Hey.

01:27:16.256 --> 01:27:17.121
Hey.

01:27:17.123 --> 01:27:18.725
Oh, yeah,
we're dating now.

01:27:19.859 --> 01:27:21.295
Surprise.

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:25.063
We were debating
when to tell you, but...

01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:27.167
- Christmas felt right.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:27:28.502 --> 01:27:30.034
You all right?

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:32.106
This is your night
in the desert.

01:27:32.506 --> 01:27:34.106
Come on, bud.

01:27:34.108 --> 01:27:35.709
Come on, buddy.
