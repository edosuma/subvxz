00:03.148 --> 00:05.483
Miranda: Tim, what if someone notices?
What if someone says something?

00:05.551 --> 00:06.517
What's the big deal?

00:06.586 --> 00:08.753
Shane is the big deal.

00:08.821 --> 00:10.622
Tim:
It's about Miranda.

00:11.591 --> 00:15.493
There could be something
and there could be nothing.

00:16.462 --> 00:18.862
I just wondered if you could
keep it under your hat.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.831
I might have given Caleb
the impression

00:20.899 --> 00:22.666
that you weren't
the perfect husband

00:22.734 --> 00:24.101
all the time.

00:24.168 --> 00:26.637
You discussed our marriage
with Caleb?

00:27.606 --> 00:29.607
(Violent punch,
Caleb grunts in pain)

00:29.674 --> 00:32.775
Aw, hell, Lou,
that's no way to say goodbye.

00:32.843 --> 00:34.510

Amy:
Good boy. Easy.

00:51.861 --> 00:53.128
Whoa, Denver.

00:55.798 --> 00:56.999
(Rope scrapes)

00:59.335 --> 01:00.468
Ty:
Okay, it's tied off.

01:00.536 --> 01:01.870
Amy:
Okay.

01:04.739 --> 01:05.673
All right.

01:05.741 --> 01:06.874
Ty:
Give it a go.

01:07.843 --> 01:09.143
(Log scrapes)

01:10.545 --> 01:11.545
(Denver whinnies shrilly)

(Groans)

01:28.095 --> 01:29.362
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:29.429 --> 01:30.664
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:31.666 --> 01:33.332
(Denver snorts restlessly)

01:34.301 --> 01:35.902
I don't get it.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.636
I mean, I thought he just had
a problem with cattle, but--

01:37.704 --> 01:39.038
Nope.

01:39.105 --> 01:41.373
Seems like that log makes
Denver buck just as hard.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.308
You know, as soon as I pulled
that rope tight

01:43.376 --> 01:44.710
he just snapped.

01:44.778 --> 01:45.944
That's not a good habit
for a ropin' horse to have.

01:46.012 --> 01:47.680
Yeah, thanks,
Dr. obvious.

01:47.747 --> 01:48.947
I'm just trying
to help you out here.

01:49.015 --> 01:51.483
Yeah? You're not
avoiding anatomy?

01:51.551 --> 01:52.817
I'm avoiding physiology.

01:52.885 --> 01:53.985
Both:
(Laugh)

01:54.053 --> 01:55.653
But you do need help
with that horse.

01:55.721 --> 01:57.488
Yeah, I think I'm gonna do
some groundwork now though,

01:57.556 --> 01:59.157
so, that means...

01:59.224 --> 02:01.059
- Study break's over?
- Mm-hmm.

02:01.126 --> 02:02.593
Okay.

02:02.661 --> 02:03.761
Thanks.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.463
Call me later.

02:06.531 --> 02:07.565
Ty:
Okay.

02:12.570 --> 02:17.007
Jack: Another post card for
you and Peter from camp.

02:17.075 --> 02:19.109
I'm sure Georgie
will send you one too.

02:19.177 --> 02:20.610
Hey, I'm glad.

02:20.678 --> 02:22.913
It means she's too busy
having fun.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.147
Doesn't matter to me.

02:24.215 --> 02:25.815
Come on, Grandpa,
you totally miss her.

02:25.882 --> 02:27.183
Well, of course I do,

02:27.250 --> 02:30.019
but I'm also capable
of keeping myself occupied.

02:30.087 --> 02:31.954
I'm working with your dad.

02:32.022 --> 02:33.789
We're gonna build
those new buck feeders.

02:33.857 --> 02:35.858
What, he hasn't weaseled out
of that one yet?

02:35.926 --> 02:37.359
Jack:
Oh, not that he hasn't tried.

02:37.427 --> 02:38.327

03:13.961 --> 03:15.161
<i>I swear.</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:18.564
Tim: Why don't we just
break out the welder

03:18.632 --> 03:19.993
and make these babies
out of steel?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.073
They'll last a lot longer--

03:21.101 --> 03:23.736
'Cause I decided
to go with wood.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.005
Tim: Well, your decisions always...
(Lumber clanks)

03:26.073 --> 03:27.706
...mean more work for me.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.741
(Truck rumbles up)

03:30.910 --> 03:32.410
Jack:
Now who is this?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.859
Tim: I don't know,
he's probably lost.

03:36.448 --> 03:37.883
Hey, Dad!

03:37.950 --> 03:39.217
That's Shane.

03:40.186 --> 03:41.719
Shane?

03:41.788 --> 03:44.389
Did you hitchhike here
all the way from Saskatchewan?

03:44.456 --> 03:46.157
No. No, it's just from
the bus station.

03:46.224 --> 03:48.592
What have I told you
about that, huh?

03:48.660 --> 03:49.726
You know how dangerous
that is.

03:49.795 --> 03:51.461
Does your mother know
you're here?

03:51.529 --> 03:52.663
She better know
you're here

03:52.730 --> 03:54.098
or you and I'll be in
a lot of trouble.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.666
Okay, listen,
I have to tell you something.

03:55.733 --> 03:56.767
It's about Mom.

03:56.835 --> 03:58.102
What? Is she okay?

03:58.170 --> 04:00.470
Yeah, yeah.
She's fine.

04:00.538 --> 04:01.504
Good.

04:02.639 --> 04:03.907
She has a new boyfriend.

gonna have to cut out.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.358
Obviously.

04:58.393 --> 05:02.363
You uh... wanna know
why he's here?

05:02.430 --> 05:03.764
(Chuckles)

05:03.832 --> 05:05.832
He thinks that Miranda
has a new boyfriend.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.669
So why does that
make you smile?

05:09.737 --> 05:11.136
(Whispers)
It's me.

05:11.204 --> 05:12.405
It's me, Jack.

05:12.473 --> 05:13.773
He found a bottle
of aftershave--

05:13.841 --> 05:15.742
Western Leather.

05:15.809 --> 05:17.309
That's my brand.

05:17.378 --> 05:18.411
So, are you gonna--

05:18.479 --> 05:20.012
You gonna tell him
you're the guy?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.913
I don't know,
I don't know.

05:21.981 --> 05:23.214
I called Miranda.
She's on her way here.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.149
We'll talk about it.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.318
(Chuckles)

05:28.254 --> 05:30.321
Hey, good luck
with those feeders.

05:30.390 --> 05:32.023
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

05:32.358 --> 05:34.693
Caleb: You shoulda seen the
wild look in your eyes.

05:34.761 --> 05:36.661
Ty: Well, how was I supposed
to know it was you?

05:36.729 --> 05:38.328
The door was wide open.

05:38.397 --> 05:39.597
Where's your truck,
anyway?

05:39.664 --> 05:42.966
Uh, it's still
in the shop.

05:43.034 --> 05:44.602
Ty:
Again, dude?

05:44.669 --> 05:45.936
Caleb: Yeah, I had a little
transmission trouble

05:46.004 --> 05:47.872
outside Black Diamond.

05:47.939 --> 05:49.006
Ty:
That's never good.

05:49.073 --> 05:50.808
Mmm.

05:50.876 --> 05:52.142
You clock as many miles
as I do,

05:52.210 --> 05:55.645
you just sort of expect
this thing to happen.

05:55.713 --> 05:57.547
Since when did you become
so zen?

05:57.615 --> 05:59.315
You making good money
on the circuit?

05:59.383 --> 06:00.383
Ah, you know me,

06:00.451 --> 06:01.731
I don't like to toot
my own horn.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.053
Then again, I can't;
It doesn't work either.

06:04.121 --> 06:07.156
(Ty and Caleb chuckle,
truck rumbles up)

06:08.358 --> 06:09.458

<i>Caleb!</i>

06:10.627 --> 06:12.093
You're back.

06:13.062 --> 06:14.463
- And you left this.
- Yes.

06:14.531 --> 06:16.532
But it looks like you're on
another study break anyway.

06:16.599 --> 06:18.534
Ah, just catching up
with my new roomie.

06:18.601 --> 06:20.836
Isn't it a little cramped
in the trailer?

06:20.904 --> 06:23.004
You know the loft
is still empty.

06:23.072 --> 06:25.640
I'm just dashin' through town
a couple of days, so it's...

06:26.608 --> 06:27.888
Oh, well,
do you have enough time

06:27.910 --> 06:29.550
to help me with a ropin' horse
that bucks?

06:29.611 --> 06:30.611
Interesting.

06:30.679 --> 06:32.480
I'll pay you
for your time.

06:32.548 --> 06:33.815
Really interesting.

06:33.882 --> 06:36.517
(Laughs) Okay,
when can you come by?

06:36.585 --> 06:38.553
Caleb:
Um... you know what?

06:38.620 --> 06:39.954
Maybe it's not such a good idea

06:40.021 --> 06:42.789
for me to come around
the ranch right now.

06:48.763 --> 06:50.403
Tim: So, what does she
say about this guy?

06:50.464 --> 06:53.466
Does she describe him
as rugged,

06:53.533 --> 06:55.034
good looking,
charming?

06:55.102 --> 06:57.170
I don't know anything
about him.

06:57.237 --> 06:59.472
You know, when I...

06:59.539 --> 07:00.739
When I saw the cologne,

07:00.807 --> 07:02.475
I knew she didn't
buy it for me.

07:02.542 --> 07:06.011
Well, it doesn't mean
she's dating anybody.

07:06.079 --> 07:10.748
Why else would she spend
a weekend in Lake Louise?

07:10.816 --> 07:12.517
Lake Louise?

07:12.585 --> 07:16.654
I saw a receipt for a fancy
romantic spa package...

07:16.722 --> 07:17.822
For two.

07:17.890 --> 07:19.358
Really.

07:19.425 --> 07:21.426
Yeah.

07:21.494 --> 07:23.494
She's been acting,
I don't know,

07:23.561 --> 07:25.696
kind of different lately.

07:25.763 --> 07:28.332
Wearing fancy clothes,
getting her hair styled,

07:28.400 --> 07:30.080
going out to make
these secret phone calls.

07:30.102 --> 07:34.905
That... doesn't sound
like your mother.

07:34.973 --> 07:36.240
I know.

07:36.308 --> 07:39.142
It seems kinda suspicious,
doesn't it?

07:39.210 --> 07:41.077
Yeah, sure does.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.547
Lake Louise.

07:46.984 --> 07:48.684
Shane:
That was good.

07:48.752 --> 07:50.387
Tim: Yeah, yeah, it's always good.
How were those fries?

07:50.454 --> 07:52.174
Shane: Aw, they were really good.
(Chuckles)

07:53.057 --> 07:54.390
<i>Tim: Hey!</i>
<i>Shane: Hey, Caleb!</i>

07:54.457 --> 07:55.391
Hey, Shane.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.492
How's it goin'?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.660
Uh, things are good,
really good.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.029
Not convinced.

08:00.897 --> 08:01.963
Bill for my truck.

08:02.032 --> 08:03.865
The new tranny must be
made of gold.

08:03.933 --> 08:06.935
Ouch! Ooh.

08:07.003 --> 08:08.404
That kinda hurts,
huh?

08:08.471 --> 08:11.139
Especially with your record
on the circuit these days.

08:11.206 --> 08:13.707
Yeah, I still follow
the results.

08:13.775 --> 08:15.543
It's just a slump.

08:15.610 --> 08:17.545
Can I offer you
some advice?

08:17.612 --> 08:18.413
No, thanks,
I'm good.

08:18.447 --> 08:20.281
It not a slump.

08:20.349 --> 08:21.516
I think it
just might be time

08:21.583 --> 08:22.716
for you to give up
the rodeo.

08:22.784 --> 08:24.318
What? You're kidding.

08:24.386 --> 08:26.253
Yeah, he's way too young
to retire.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.687
When I was his age,

08:27.755 --> 08:29.189
I was winnin'
all the major rodeos,

08:29.257 --> 08:31.925
except I had a sweet little
endorsement deal.

08:31.992 --> 08:33.427
Really?

08:33.494 --> 08:36.063
I was still barely keeping
my head above water.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.432
No, winnin' sometimes
isn't enough for rodeo.

08:38.499 --> 08:40.767
It's an all the time thing,
and if you're not...

08:40.833 --> 08:42.101
(Sucks his teeth)

08:42.169 --> 08:43.102
You might have
to think about

08:43.169 --> 08:44.870
getting a real job.

08:44.938 --> 08:47.306
What else should I do?

08:47.374 --> 08:48.307
They might need
a potato peeler

08:48.375 --> 08:50.909
at Maggie's.

08:50.977 --> 08:53.212
(Drill whirs)

08:54.747 --> 08:56.115
(Truck rumbles up)

09:01.753 --> 09:03.321
Rich:
Hey, Jack.

09:03.389 --> 09:06.724
Jack: Rich Wannstedt, how
the heck have you been?

09:06.792 --> 09:09.094
I'm good, Jack.
I just got into town,

09:09.161 --> 09:11.796
I thought I'd pop by
to see what's new.

09:11.863 --> 09:13.931
Oh, same old same old.

09:13.999 --> 09:16.066
You still runnin' those
bronc riding competitions

09:16.134 --> 09:17.067
in Montana?

09:17.135 --> 09:18.368
Yes, sir.

09:18.436 --> 09:20.036
I'm actually lookin'
to expand up in Alberta,

09:20.105 --> 09:22.672
so I need to find somebody
I can trust

09:22.740 --> 09:25.008
to run the Canadian side
of it for me.

09:25.076 --> 09:26.910
Yeah, well, I could probably
come up with a few names

09:26.978 --> 09:28.745
you should talk to.

09:28.813 --> 09:30.879
No, Jack, I want you.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.583
Oh, you can't be serious!

09:33.650 --> 09:36.486
Well, why not?
You'd be the perfect guy.

09:36.553 --> 09:37.520
I don't think so.

09:37.588 --> 09:38.654
(Country song ringtone rings)

09:38.722 --> 09:40.022
Oh...

09:40.991 --> 09:42.992
Just think about it,
okay, Jack?

09:43.059 --> 09:43.993
(Cell phone beeps on)

09:44.060 --> 09:45.561
Hey, Barry.

09:45.629 --> 09:47.262
Tim:
Rich!

09:47.330 --> 09:48.530
Nice truck.

09:48.598 --> 09:49.964
You overcompensatin'
for somethin'?

09:50.032 --> 09:52.434
Rich:
Yeah, great to see you too, Tim.

09:52.502 --> 09:53.635
Ah, don't worry about it,
Barry.

09:53.702 --> 09:55.570
Just, uh, headin' out now.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.904
What's the matter?

09:56.972 --> 09:57.772
You still not over
the time he beat you

09:57.840 --> 09:59.274
at the Calgary Stampede?

09:59.342 --> 10:00.342
She's seeing another guy.

10:00.409 --> 10:01.476
Who?

10:01.544 --> 10:02.909
Miranda.
She's got a new boyfriend.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.313
She went on some romantic
getaway to Lake Louise.

10:06.381 --> 10:08.415
I thought we had
an understanding.

10:08.483 --> 10:09.883
No.

10:09.951 --> 10:11.985
You thought as long as
you didn't talk about it

10:12.053 --> 10:13.621
you wouldn't have
to make a commitment,

10:13.688 --> 10:15.022
and now...

10:15.089 --> 10:18.591
Well, it's come back around
to bite you in the ass.

10:20.093 --> 10:20.993
Amy: Grandpa says you
came all the way here

10:21.061 --> 10:22.595
to talk to Dad about something?

10:22.663 --> 10:25.431
Shane: Yeah, my mom's
seeing some guy.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.766
And what's wrong
with that?

10:26.833 --> 10:29.369
Well, it just always
gets complicated.

10:29.436 --> 10:31.371
So, what, she's not allowed
to see other guys?

10:31.438 --> 10:33.773
No, it's just things have
been going great lately,

10:33.840 --> 10:35.641
with Mom and Dad getting along
so well...

10:35.708 --> 10:38.143
So you think that Dad
can help with that?

10:38.211 --> 10:40.011
Maybe he can just talk
some sense into her.

10:40.079 --> 10:41.246
(Car approaches)

10:41.314 --> 10:42.347
Oh.

10:44.317 --> 10:45.350
Uh-oh!

10:50.955 --> 10:52.657
Amy: Hello, Miranda,
it's nice to see you.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.158
Miranda:
Yeah, you too.

10:54.226 --> 10:56.927
This trip was
a little unexpected.

10:56.995 --> 10:59.664
Seriously, Shane,
again?

10:59.731 --> 11:02.633
I'm sorry, Mom,
I just really needed to--

11:02.701 --> 11:03.834
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Miranda.</i>

11:03.902 --> 11:05.069
- Glad you made it.
- Hi.

11:05.136 --> 11:06.269
Let's get you
settled in.

11:06.337 --> 11:07.671
Not until I have a word
with our son.

11:07.738 --> 11:09.072
Oh, that can wait.

11:09.139 --> 11:10.579
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>follow me to the dude ranch.</i>

11:10.608 --> 11:11.774
Miranda:
You're still in trouble, buddy.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.476
Tim:
Let's just go.

11:18.482 --> 11:20.083
(Door opens)

11:20.150 --> 11:21.251
Miranda:
Hey!

11:23.286 --> 11:24.653
Tim:
You're seein' a new guy?

11:24.721 --> 11:25.887
Miranda:
What?

11:27.490 --> 11:29.658
Tim:
You got a new boyfriend.

11:29.726 --> 11:31.227
- What're you talking--
- Shane told me

11:31.294 --> 11:33.028
all about your little trip
to Lake Louise,

11:33.096 --> 11:34.796
how you've been tartin' it up,

11:34.864 --> 11:37.799
sneaking off to whisper
sweet nothings into the phone.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.434
Tarting up?

11:39.501 --> 11:41.502
Sweet nothings?
(Laughs)

11:41.570 --> 11:44.171
Tim: Oh, I'm glad you
think this is funny,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.241
but the joke's on me.

11:46.308 --> 11:48.142
Who is this idiot?!

11:48.210 --> 11:49.644
You're the idiot.

11:51.213 --> 11:53.147
You're the idiot
I've been trying to impress,

11:53.215 --> 11:56.750
sneaking calls to you like a...
like a lovesick teenager.

11:57.719 --> 11:59.686
I'm not the one that you were
havin' a mud wrap with

11:59.754 --> 12:00.887
in Lake Louise.

12:00.955 --> 12:03.056
No, that was Cheryl.

12:03.124 --> 12:04.858
<i>She had a hotel</i>
<i>weekend package</i>

12:04.925 --> 12:06.393
and her husband got called away
to work,

12:06.461 --> 12:10.163
so... (Laughing) we turned it
into a girl's weekend!

12:11.131 --> 12:12.831
I'm an idiot.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.271
Yes... yes, you are.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.940
(Chuckles)

12:27.313 --> 12:28.146
Tim: (Laughing) I'm an idiot.

12:28.213 --> 12:29.614
Miranda:
(Giggles)

12:37.690 --> 12:38.890
Lou: Miranda, hello?
(Knocks lightly)

12:38.957 --> 12:40.124
<i>Oh my God!</i>

12:40.192 --> 12:41.092
<i>Tim: Lou!</i>
<i>Miranda: Lou!</i>

12:41.160 --> 12:42.459
<i>(Door bangs shut)</i>

12:42.527 --> 12:44.628
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>This is not what it looks like!</i>

12:47.031 --> 12:50.834
Lou: (Whispers) Oh my God!
Oh my God.

12:58.231 --> 12:59.231
<i>Amy: Do you want
some bacon bits?</i>

12:59.548 --> 13:00.581
No, thank you.

13:01.783 --> 13:03.151
She likes hers undressed.

13:03.219 --> 13:04.784
(Lou chokes)

13:04.852 --> 13:07.254
Tim: I mean she likes hers
plain, with nothing on.

13:07.322 --> 13:08.322
Lou:
(Coughs nervously)

13:08.390 --> 13:09.256
The potato.
I like potatoes.

13:09.324 --> 13:11.858
<i>I'll have a potato.</i>

13:11.926 --> 13:14.127
So, I hear that my old rival

13:15.095 --> 13:17.530
wants to bring his bronc shows
up to Canada.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.832
Did that have anything to do
with rich snooping around today?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.401
He might've mentioned
somethin' about that.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.568
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:22.636 --> 13:24.437
Don't think I don't know
what he's up to--

13:24.505 --> 13:26.939
Sniffing around you
to get to me.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.241
Excuse me?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.742
Well, he's gonna have
to swallow his pride

13:30.809 --> 13:33.845
and come beggin' to me
to run his new deal for him.

13:33.913 --> 13:37.582
Well, actually, Tim,
he's asked me to run it for him.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.552
Tim: Oh.
Amy: That's great!

13:40.619 --> 13:41.886
Grandpa, way to go.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.255
Don't go jumpin'
to conclusions.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.222
I'm turnin' him down.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.391
Amy: No, come on,
you gotta do it.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.179
<i>Jack: There's too much
to do around here. I--</i>

13:49.227 --> 13:51.963
Hey, what about Caleb?
Maybe he could help out.

13:52.031 --> 13:55.667
Jack: Well, uh, Caleb is
on the road right now.

13:56.635 --> 13:57.835
<i>Shane:</i>
<i>Actually, he's not.</i>

13:57.903 --> 14:00.004
We just saw him in town,

14:00.072 --> 14:01.752
and it sure sounds like
he could use a job.

14:04.442 --> 14:07.477
Well, there were some other
issues with Caleb's work.

14:07.545 --> 14:08.779
<i>Amy: Don't you think it's
time for you and Caleb</i>

14:08.846 --> 14:11.748
to deal with those
"work" issues, Lou?

14:13.017 --> 14:15.085
So, Shane, what are you gonna
get up to tomorrow?

14:15.152 --> 14:17.019
Tim:
Trail riding with pal.

14:17.955 --> 14:20.222
Jack:
Well, isn't that nice.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.824
No, don't worry, Tim,

14:21.892 --> 14:24.159
<i>i'll build those feeders</i>
<i>by myself.</i>

14:24.227 --> 14:26.462
Great. Excellent.

14:26.529 --> 14:28.564
That's very generous of you.

14:31.068 --> 14:33.602
It's no problem, Jack,
I'm glad to help out.

14:33.669 --> 14:34.869
I'll be there at 9:00.

14:34.937 --> 14:36.337
<i>Okay, see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

14:40.009 --> 14:42.443
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>"Career College?"</i>

14:42.511 --> 14:44.178
What are you gonna do
with this?

14:44.246 --> 14:45.379
Well...

14:45.447 --> 14:48.316
I figure it's time
I get a real job.

14:48.383 --> 14:50.383
Ty: Like a 9-to-5?
Are you kidding?

14:50.451 --> 14:51.418
What happened to the rodeo?

14:51.486 --> 14:52.686
It's not a career

14:52.754 --> 14:54.488
if you spend more
than you ever make.

14:54.555 --> 14:56.490
What's with
the sudden negativity?

14:56.557 --> 14:57.791
I thought you were on
a hot streak?

14:57.859 --> 14:59.026
It ended.

14:59.094 --> 15:01.061
They come fast
and go even faster.

15:01.129 --> 15:02.997
<i>Let's face it,</i>
<i>if it wasn't for the rodeo</i>

15:03.064 --> 15:04.598
<i>I wouldn't be so broke,</i>

15:04.666 --> 15:06.133
I wouldn't have to rely on
your rent cheques so much,

15:06.200 --> 15:07.700
and...

15:07.768 --> 15:09.436
I probably wouldn't be
so divorced.

15:09.504 --> 15:11.037
Look...

15:11.105 --> 15:12.339
I think you'd feel
a whole lot better

15:12.406 --> 15:14.207
if you had a couple bucks
in your pocket.

15:14.275 --> 15:15.475
So, why don't you call Amy?

15:15.543 --> 15:16.376
She still needs some help
with that horse.

15:16.444 --> 15:18.278
I am not going over there.

15:19.247 --> 15:23.081
Look, the last time I saw Lou
I said goodbye and I...

15:23.150 --> 15:25.651
I meant it.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.085
You're scared of her,
aren't ya?

15:27.154 --> 15:28.954
I'm not scared.

15:29.022 --> 15:30.922
I just, I don't want things
to get weird again.

15:32.892 --> 15:34.092
Well, the longer
you stay away,

15:34.127 --> 15:36.328
the weirder things
are gonna get.

15:37.296 --> 15:38.329
Hmm.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.765
(Scrubbing)

15:43.869 --> 15:45.836
Amy: What was going on
with you at dinner?

15:45.904 --> 15:47.305
Nothing.

15:47.373 --> 15:48.640
Come on, Lou,

15:48.707 --> 15:49.974
there was definitely
something going on

15:50.042 --> 15:51.376
between you, Dad,
and Miranda.

15:51.443 --> 15:53.177
You guys couldn't even look
each other in the eye.

15:53.244 --> 15:56.280
Yeah, well, let's just say
I already got an eyeful.

15:56.347 --> 15:57.548
Leave it alone.

15:57.615 --> 16:00.750
Well, leave what alone?
What's going on?

16:00.818 --> 16:04.154
Okay. But you better
brace yourself.

16:04.222 --> 16:06.990
I... walked in on them.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.758
You walked in on them...

16:09.826 --> 16:11.627
- Do you mean...
- Yeah.

16:11.695 --> 16:14.129
- They were...
- Oh, yeah.

16:14.198 --> 16:15.364
Oh my...

16:15.432 --> 16:16.632
Hey, I'm the one
who can't scrub the image

16:16.700 --> 16:18.234
from my brain.

16:18.302 --> 16:20.336
Well, how long has this
been going on?

16:20.404 --> 16:22.705
Jack:
Oh, nearly five months now.

16:23.707 --> 16:24.707
Lou:
You knew?

16:26.409 --> 16:27.809
Sort of, yeah.

16:27.876 --> 16:29.143
And you didn't
say anything?

16:29.212 --> 16:30.978
What good would
that have done?

16:31.046 --> 16:33.515
Well, I wouldn't have
just walked in on...

16:33.583 --> 16:35.149
What I walked in on.

16:35.218 --> 16:36.251
Ugh.

16:38.787 --> 16:40.755
Shane: Hey, did you bring
those muffins, Mom?

16:40.823 --> 16:43.056
Miranda: Yeah, they're
in my saddle bag.

16:45.827 --> 16:47.228
Did you find
anything out?

16:47.295 --> 16:48.229
You guys were alone
in the cabin

16:48.296 --> 16:49.763
for a long time.

16:49.831 --> 16:51.599
Yeah.

16:51.666 --> 16:55.402
We were talking...
about school, you.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.204
So, no, I didn't really
find the right time

16:57.271 --> 16:59.339
to ask about the boyfriend.

16:59.406 --> 17:01.741
Hmm...
So you got nothing.

17:01.808 --> 17:04.277
I'm gonna-
I'll get something.

17:04.345 --> 17:05.877
Okay.

17:05.945 --> 17:10.116
So I heard you got some good
write-ups about your play.

17:10.183 --> 17:11.983
Look, you don't have to pretend
to be interested.

17:12.051 --> 17:13.618
Are you kidding me?
I loved it.

17:13.685 --> 17:15.086
Shane:
You read it?

17:15.154 --> 17:16.820
Tim: Well, the part
about the rodeo dad

17:16.888 --> 17:19.290
<i>who was all full of himself</i>
<i>was a bit over the top.</i>

17:19.358 --> 17:21.660
<i>Shane and Tim:</i>
<i>(Laugh)</i>

17:25.931 --> 17:28.066
Amy: What, Georgie still
hasn't sent you a letter?

17:28.134 --> 17:30.167
I'm just lookin'
for the phone bill here.

17:30.235 --> 17:31.935
Right.

17:32.003 --> 17:33.704
And you're late.

17:33.772 --> 17:35.873
Ty:
What? Only by five minutes.

17:35.940 --> 17:38.008
Well, I'm wonderin'
what happened to people

17:38.076 --> 17:40.844
doin' what they say
they're gonna do.

17:45.416 --> 17:46.650
What's up with him?

17:46.717 --> 17:49.886
Georgie said she'd write.
She hasn't.

17:49.953 --> 17:51.154
Oh.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.889
Don't worry about that.
He'll get over it.

17:52.956 --> 17:54.658
Thanks for coming
and helping him out.

17:54.725 --> 17:55.792
No problem.

17:55.859 --> 17:58.428
Gives me an excuse
to come see you.

17:58.496 --> 18:00.062
You don't need
an excuse.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.497
Both:
(Laugh)

18:03.566 --> 18:06.034
Lou:
Ugh! You guys, get a room!

18:10.006 --> 18:10.939
What's up with her?

18:11.007 --> 18:13.342
You don't wanna know.

18:13.410 --> 18:14.476
Hey, I think
I convinced Caleb

18:14.544 --> 18:15.844
to come help you
with Denver.

18:15.912 --> 18:17.279
That's great,
thanks.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.747
Yeah, maybe it'll help him
get his mojo back.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.916
He's been lookin' at all
these crazy career options,

18:21.983 --> 18:23.685
and this morning
he was on the phone

18:23.752 --> 18:26.120
getting information
about becoming a mall cop.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.855
- Really.
- Yeah.

18:27.923 --> 18:29.023
(Sighs)

18:29.090 --> 18:30.451
Well, maybe you can
talk to Grandpa

18:30.459 --> 18:33.294
about his career
opportunity.

18:33.361 --> 18:34.894
What career opportunity?

18:34.962 --> 18:35.995
(Hammer bangs)

18:36.063 --> 18:37.497
Ty:
So, Jack,

18:37.565 --> 18:39.599
tell me about this amazing
new job offer you got.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.267
Jack:
(Chuckles)

18:41.336 --> 18:43.837
Yeah, sure it is,
if you want to spend your life

18:43.904 --> 18:45.905
travellin' all over
hell's half acre

18:45.973 --> 18:48.141
dealing with venues
and sponsors

18:48.209 --> 18:49.775
and stock providers
and...

18:50.744 --> 18:52.645
Come on,
it's the rodeo.

18:52.713 --> 18:55.314
Yeah, and this ranch
just runs itself, does it?

18:55.382 --> 18:57.115
Well...

18:57.183 --> 18:59.685
Lou already takes care
of the finances.

18:59.753 --> 19:02.154
It would force Tim to pick up
his end with the herd.

19:02.222 --> 19:03.356
(Chuckles)
Yeah.

19:03.423 --> 19:04.923
Come on, Jack,

19:04.991 --> 19:07.225
can you honestly say
you don't miss that whole game?

19:07.292 --> 19:08.827
Well, of course I do.

19:09.928 --> 19:11.730
Cowboys, you know,
friends,

19:12.698 --> 19:13.898
that excitement you get

19:13.966 --> 19:15.233
when they're puttin'
the rough stock

19:15.300 --> 19:16.601
in the chute there
for ya.

19:16.669 --> 19:18.470
(Chuckles)

19:18.537 --> 19:20.004
All the pretty girls,

19:20.072 --> 19:22.606
they ride into the arena
with their flags wavin' and...

19:23.742 --> 19:25.008
The crowd, you know,

19:25.076 --> 19:26.510
that sound they make
after a good ride,

19:26.578 --> 19:28.211
that's...

19:30.815 --> 19:32.750
That was another time.

19:32.817 --> 19:35.018
Doesn't have to be.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.387
You're always doin' stuff
for everyone else,

19:37.454 --> 19:38.954
maybe it's time you did
something for you.

19:39.022 --> 19:40.723
Yeah.

19:40.791 --> 19:42.759
I think more hammerin'
and less yammerin'.

19:53.436 --> 19:54.803
(Bridle clatters,
Caleb gasps)

19:54.871 --> 19:56.104

19:56.873 --> 19:58.473

20:00.342 --> 20:01.309
Caleb:
Hey, Lou.

20:01.377 --> 20:03.645
Hi, Caleb.
How are you?

20:03.713 --> 20:04.979
Good.
You're good?

20:05.047 --> 20:06.415
Yeah, good.

20:06.482 --> 20:07.348

<i>Hey.</i>

20:07.417 --> 20:09.150

Hi, Amy.

20:09.218 --> 20:10.779
Well, I should get to work
on the horse.

20:10.819 --> 20:12.386
Yeah, me too.
I should get back to work.

20:12.454 --> 20:13.721
Lou and Caleb:
(Clear their throats)

20:13.789 --> 20:15.723

20:24.800 --> 20:25.765
Tim: Looks like you
finally found a steer

20:25.833 --> 20:28.267
you can keep up with, huh?

20:28.335 --> 20:31.003
(Steer snorts and bellows)

20:31.071 --> 20:32.204
Caleb:
Huh! Whoa! Huh!

20:32.272 --> 20:34.774

20:34.842 --> 20:36.342
Caleb:
(Gasp) Whoa!

20:36.410 --> 20:37.744
(Denver whinnies shrilly)

20:37.778 --> 20:39.412

20:39.480 --> 20:40.580
<i>Amy: Ride it through,

Tim: Just another day at
the office, huh, buddy?

20:51.858 --> 20:53.759
I'm fine, thanks.

20:53.827 --> 20:55.107
<i>Tim: I'm sorry, honey, but that-</i>

20:55.161 --> 20:57.728
that guy's never gonna make
a ropin' horse.

20:57.796 --> 20:58.629
Well, that's the only
kind of horse

20:58.697 --> 21:00.397
that my client owns, Dad.

21:00.466 --> 21:02.099
<i>Tim: Well, your client
should get rid of him,</i>

21:02.167 --> 21:03.407
'cause nobody'd be crazy enough

21:03.435 --> 21:05.102
to buy a horse
that bucks like that.

21:05.203 --> 21:07.171
Thanks, Dad,
that's helpful.

21:07.205 --> 21:08.973
I call 'em as I see 'em.

21:09.007 --> 21:10.040
Come on.

21:13.044 --> 21:14.444
You know,
he's really got a knack

21:14.545 --> 21:15.645
for telling me exactly
what I don't wannna hear.

21:15.713 --> 21:17.781
Especially when he's right.

21:20.718 --> 21:22.719
(Wrench cranks)

21:22.787 --> 21:25.388
Tim: Wow! You guys
still aren't finished?

21:25.456 --> 21:28.057
Well, feel free
to grab a hammer.

21:28.125 --> 21:31.193
Tim: Actually, uh, I
want to talk to you.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.661
Jack:
Yup.

21:32.729 --> 21:35.230
Seems to be a trend
around here.

21:38.301 --> 21:39.735
Hey...

21:39.803 --> 21:42.638
There are actually locks
on those cabin doors, you know?

21:42.706 --> 21:44.406
(Laughing) Oh,
did she tell you about that?

21:46.475 --> 21:47.876
Hope she's okay.

21:47.943 --> 21:49.844
Well, I don't think you
damaged her permanently, no,

21:49.912 --> 21:51.980
but you might want
to let sleeping dogs lie.

21:52.047 --> 21:55.617
I'm sure it's the last thing
she wants to talk about.

21:55.684 --> 21:57.952
Miranda: Hey, Lou, I
think we should talk.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.286
Oh...

21:59.354 --> 22:00.722
Hi. Uh, yes.

22:03.992 --> 22:05.759
Is everything okay
with your cabin?

22:05.827 --> 22:06.994
Yes, thank you.

22:07.061 --> 22:08.929
Good!
Did you need more towels?

22:08.997 --> 22:09.997
No, we're good.

22:10.064 --> 22:11.031
More soap?

22:11.098 --> 22:12.499
- No.
- Oh, potpourri.

22:12.567 --> 22:14.835
Lou...

22:14.903 --> 22:17.570
Look, I know this
is awkward,

22:18.539 --> 22:20.272
but I just wanna apologize.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.675
No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

22:22.743 --> 22:26.579
Really, I shouldn't have
just barged in on...

22:26.647 --> 22:28.180
That.

22:28.248 --> 22:29.515
Can we just not talk
about this?

22:29.583 --> 22:30.583
Sure.

22:30.651 --> 22:31.684
Great.

22:32.753 --> 22:33.852
But I hope you know

22:33.920 --> 22:36.755
this isn't some crazy
fling for me,

22:36.822 --> 22:39.157
and it's getting
pretty serious.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.526
I just don't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.294
Well, it sure seemed
like a big deal

22:43.362 --> 22:45.496
when you thought
there was some other guy.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.132
Oh, I want it
to be exclusive...

22:48.200 --> 22:49.667
And casual.

22:49.734 --> 22:51.702
Exclusively casual.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.071
And I'm actually starting
to think

22:54.138 --> 22:56.339
that we have
a future together.

22:56.407 --> 22:57.875
I just don't think we should
get ahead of ourselves.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.043
You know what I mean.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.511
And maybe, maybe,
I don't know,

23:01.580 --> 23:03.413
it's time we settle down.

23:04.348 --> 23:06.983
That's why I don't think
we should tell Shane.

23:07.051 --> 23:09.218
And I think it's time
we tell Shane.

23:09.286 --> 23:11.821
And what would you say?

23:11.889 --> 23:14.823
Well, maybe that we're
ready to be a family.

23:14.891 --> 23:17.993
- You mean...
- Marriage?

23:18.061 --> 23:20.495
I don't know. Maybe.
Why not?

23:22.031 --> 23:22.998
(Uncomfortable chuckle)

23:23.066 --> 23:24.099
(Giggles)

23:29.127 --> 23:31.762
<i>Lou: You should have heard her
going on and on about Dad,</i>

23:32.080 --> 23:34.814
like she is totally smitten.

23:34.882 --> 23:36.616
I think it's more serious
than we thought.

23:36.684 --> 23:39.251
Really?
Like how serious?

23:39.319 --> 23:40.887
She actually used
the "M" word.

23:40.955 --> 23:41.888
Marriage?

23:41.956 --> 23:43.456
Jack:
(Chokes)

23:43.523 --> 23:45.157
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

23:45.225 --> 23:47.426
Yeah, I'm fine,
I just...

23:47.494 --> 23:49.428
Surprised me is all.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.997
Well, maybe there's hope
for those two after all.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.567
Great day, huh?

23:55.635 --> 23:56.835
Yeah, it was fun.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.269
(Chuckles)

23:58.337 --> 24:00.072
And I've been thinking
about our dilemma.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.539
Which one's that?

24:01.608 --> 24:02.674
Telling Shane.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.142
Oh, me too.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.110
- And I think we should--
- Keep it under wraps.

24:05.177 --> 24:08.479
Totally agree,
100 percent.

24:08.546 --> 24:11.015
You-what?
You're thinking...

24:11.984 --> 24:14.184
Well, yeah, why not?

24:16.454 --> 24:19.657
Well, I just didn't wanna
make it a big deal.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.825
Well, it is a big deal,

24:22.793 --> 24:23.960
at least it is to me.

24:24.028 --> 24:26.696
Oh, that's...
That's not what I meant.

24:26.764 --> 24:29.599
It's just things have been
going so well between us,

24:29.667 --> 24:31.935
and me and Shane.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.670
Why mess with success?

24:33.738 --> 24:37.373
Well, he's gonna find out
at some point.

24:37.441 --> 24:38.941
I just don't see
any good reason

24:39.009 --> 24:42.144
why we should
keep it a secret.

24:42.211 --> 24:45.313
Well, why don't we
sleep on it?

24:46.282 --> 24:47.650
All right.

24:49.218 --> 24:53.421
(Whispers) No, no, no!
He might be watching.

24:53.489 --> 24:56.824
Oh, well, okay.

25:00.062 --> 25:01.029
Tim:
See you tomorrow.

25:01.096 --> 25:02.063
<i>Miranda:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:06.434 --> 25:07.935
Ty: All right, Caleb,
let's get goin'.

25:08.003 --> 25:09.137
I don't want Jack to jump
all over me

25:09.204 --> 25:10.904
for being late again.

25:10.972 --> 25:11.972
Caleb: Hey, what do you think
about underwater welding

25:12.040 --> 25:13.473
and construction?

25:14.441 --> 25:15.542
Can you even swim?

25:15.609 --> 25:17.978
It's never too late
to learn.

25:18.046 --> 25:19.212
Well, what happened
to the laser eye technician

25:19.280 --> 25:20.681
that you were on about
last night?

25:20.748 --> 25:22.582
World of options, Ty.

25:22.650 --> 25:24.484
Hey, uh, I need a favour.
When we get to the ranch,

25:24.552 --> 25:27.586
would you mind checking
the barn office for me?

25:27.654 --> 25:29.121
Yeah, I do mind,

25:29.189 --> 25:31.757
and I hope Lou's in there
so you're forced to cowboy up.

25:31.825 --> 25:32.992
You're gonna have to deal
with this sometime, man,

25:33.060 --> 25:35.094
so it might as well
be today.

25:35.162 --> 25:38.330
Come on, dude,
help a brother out.

25:39.265 --> 25:42.000
Fine, I'll poke my head
in the office,

25:42.068 --> 25:43.601
but if she's there

25:43.669 --> 25:45.804
I'm tellin' her
you wanna talk.

25:45.871 --> 25:48.073
Caleb:
Don't you dare, Borden!

25:48.908 --> 25:51.242
<i>Georgie on recording: And then I had
to sleep beside Emily Dinsmore.</i>

25:51.310 --> 25:54.645

<i>listening to her all night.</i>

Is that Georgie?

26:11.429 --> 26:13.830
Yeah. Yeah, she uh...

26:13.897 --> 26:16.599
She sent me her voice recorder
in the mail.

26:16.666 --> 26:17.867
(Chuckles)

26:17.935 --> 26:18.868
What, like a letter on tape
kind of thing?

26:18.936 --> 26:21.137
Ah, yeah,
kind of like that.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.271
Oh, don't tell, Lou,

26:22.339 --> 26:23.973
'cause she's only
been sendin' her

26:24.041 --> 26:27.376
these two and three word
postcards.

26:27.444 --> 26:28.845
She's the reason you didn't
wanna take the job,

26:28.912 --> 26:30.612
isn't she?

26:30.679 --> 26:32.513
We're done talkin'
about that.

26:32.581 --> 26:34.282
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>I totally get it, Jack.</i>

26:34.350 --> 26:37.585
You want to be here for her,
but you can do both.

<i>I bet she'd think</i>
<i>it'd be pretty cool</i>

26:54.702 --> 26:55.770
<i>Damn it.</i>

26:55.837 --> 26:56.837
Amy:
What?

26:56.905 --> 26:58.773
Nothing.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.560
Amy: You know, I really don't get
this thing with you and Caleb.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.176
There is no "thing," okay?

27:03.244 --> 27:04.677
Really?

27:04.745 --> 27:07.080
Didn't seem like it
in the barn the other day.

27:07.148 --> 27:08.447
Lou...

27:08.515 --> 27:10.349
Is there something
that you're telling me?

27:10.417 --> 27:12.518
No!
Amy, that's enough!

27:12.586 --> 27:16.089
Then why you can't you
just get past this?

27:16.157 --> 27:17.623
I don't know,
okay?

27:17.691 --> 27:22.161
I don't know why it's blown up
into this big stupid deal!

27:22.228 --> 27:24.863
Maybe because
you let it.

27:30.870 --> 27:32.171
(Denver snorts)

27:35.908 --> 27:37.275
Caleb:
Yup.

27:42.881 --> 27:45.316
<i>Rich: Looks like he's got a
real attitude, that one.</i>

27:45.383 --> 27:47.584
Caleb:
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:47.652 --> 27:50.720
<i>He's been drivin'</i>
<i>his owner crazy.</i>

27:51.755 --> 27:53.756
Caleb.
Caleb Odell.

27:53.825 --> 27:56.526
Right, you've ridden in
a couple of my competitions.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.761
Yes, sir,
Mr. Wannstedt.

27:58.830 --> 28:00.130
What brings you to town?

28:00.198 --> 28:02.158
Well, I'm gonna run some
bronc riding competitions

28:02.200 --> 28:03.566
up here next season,

28:03.634 --> 28:06.202
and I'm hopin' to get Jack
to agree to run it for me.

28:06.269 --> 28:07.703
He'd be perfect for it.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.638
Yeah, if I can pry him
away from the ranch

28:09.706 --> 28:11.273
long enough to do it.

28:11.341 --> 28:12.274
(Chuckles)
Good luck.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.076
Yeah, thanks.

28:14.144 --> 28:15.177
You know you should
get that guy

28:15.245 --> 28:16.745
<i>in a chute some time,</i>

28:16.813 --> 28:19.915
see if he can do
the real deal.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.391
Rich:
So, Jack, what do you say?

28:30.459 --> 28:31.993
You wanna get back
in the game?

28:32.061 --> 28:35.529
You know, Rich...
(Lumber thumps loudly)

28:35.597 --> 28:37.098
I appreciate the offer,

28:37.166 --> 28:38.999
and it really would be
a lot of fun...

28:39.067 --> 28:41.168
Uh-oh! I think I know
where this is going.

28:41.236 --> 28:44.204
Well, actually,
I was gonna say...

28:44.272 --> 28:46.806
I'm in.
Let's do it.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.175
Rich:
That's great!

28:48.243 --> 28:50.110
That is a load
off my mind.

28:50.178 --> 28:51.378
<i>Things are moving</i>
<i>pretty quick.</i>

28:51.379 --> 28:52.980
We're already behind
the eight ball.

28:53.047 --> 28:54.146
So let's sit down

28:54.214 --> 28:55.547
and I'll bring you
up to speed.

28:55.615 --> 28:58.184
Sure, but I was kinda
in the middle

28:58.252 --> 29:00.086
of this project here.

29:00.153 --> 29:02.188
Ty: Oh, hey, I've got
it, Jack, you go ahead.

29:02.256 --> 29:03.555
(Cell phone chimes)

29:03.623 --> 29:05.191
Oh, shoot! I was supposed
to meet this guy

29:05.259 --> 29:07.326
at the rodeo grounds
an hour ago.

29:07.394 --> 29:09.528
How about I come back
in a few hours

29:09.596 --> 29:11.429
and we talk about our trip
to Grand Prairie.

29:11.497 --> 29:13.031
Grand Prairie?

29:13.099 --> 29:14.065
Yeah, well, that's where
we're holding the first event.

29:14.133 --> 29:17.001
We gotta get everything
set up asap.

29:17.969 --> 29:21.405
Well, I suppose I could
rearrange some things.

29:21.472 --> 29:22.940
When were you thinkin'
of going?

29:23.008 --> 29:23.974
Well, tomorrow.

29:24.042 --> 29:25.943
Tomorrow?
Now, wait a minute--

29:26.011 --> 29:27.211
I'll fill you in
on all the details

29:27.279 --> 29:29.079
when I get back.

29:29.147 --> 29:31.748
Damn, Jack, it is good
to have you on board.

29:31.816 --> 29:33.249
(Slaps his arm)

29:33.317 --> 29:34.850
(Cell phone beeps on)
Hey, Bill.

29:34.919 --> 29:36.920
Yeah, comin' right at you,
buddy.

29:36.987 --> 29:39.622
Grand Prairie,
that's a hell of a drive.

29:39.689 --> 29:41.391
It'll be a good road trip
for ya.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.394
Yeah.

29:48.899 --> 29:49.864
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Hey, there.</i>

29:49.933 --> 29:51.466
(Stall door bangs shut)

29:51.534 --> 29:52.935
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>Hey, Lou.</i>

29:53.903 --> 29:56.371
Nice of you to help Amy out
with that horse.

29:56.439 --> 29:57.372
Ah, don't worry.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.274
I won't be here
much longer.

29:59.342 --> 30:01.643
Hey, doesn't bother me.

30:01.710 --> 30:02.978
(Chuckles)
Come on.

30:03.046 --> 30:04.512
After everything
that's happened between us...

30:04.580 --> 30:05.879
(Sighs)

30:05.948 --> 30:07.881
Actually, Caleb,
when you think about it,

30:07.950 --> 30:10.551
nothing really
has happened, so...

30:10.618 --> 30:11.885
There really is no reason

30:11.954 --> 30:13.220
for us to be all weird
with each other,

30:13.288 --> 30:16.523
so let's just not,
okay?

30:16.591 --> 30:20.594
I think it's a little more
complicated than that.

30:20.662 --> 30:23.363
How did we let this
stupid thing snowball like this?

30:23.431 --> 30:24.664
I mean, you and Peter
got past it,

30:24.731 --> 30:26.232
why can't we?

30:26.300 --> 30:27.800
It's different.

30:28.735 --> 30:30.570
How did you guys
settle it, anyway?

30:30.637 --> 30:33.273
I'd prefer to keep that
between me and Peter.

30:33.341 --> 30:35.475
What, because of some
stupid "guy's code"?

30:35.542 --> 30:37.242
What, did you spit
on your hands

30:37.310 --> 30:38.410
and shake on it?

30:38.478 --> 30:40.212
Chug a beer?
You do a man hug-

30:40.280 --> 30:41.813
I let him hit me.

30:42.782 --> 30:43.882
He did what?

30:43.950 --> 30:47.219
Yeah, right in the face,
Even Steven.

30:47.287 --> 30:48.320
(Hard slap)

30:48.388 --> 30:50.255
(Gasps in pain)
(Satisfied gasp)

30:50.323 --> 30:51.590
What was that for?

30:51.657 --> 30:54.058
Kissing a married woman.

30:54.126 --> 30:57.362
Wow! That really does
feel better.

30:58.330 --> 31:00.298
So...

31:00.366 --> 31:01.632
Are we good?

31:02.601 --> 31:04.235
Yes, we are.

31:07.639 --> 31:08.672
(Chuckles)

31:13.835 --> 31:14.868
(Door opens)

31:16.972 --> 31:17.838
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Hey, there.</i>

31:17.906 --> 31:19.339
Hey.

31:20.308 --> 31:21.742
Good tunes?

31:21.810 --> 31:22.977
Oh, I'm just listenin'

31:23.044 --> 31:26.146
to Georgie's adventures
at camp.

31:26.214 --> 31:28.347
Tim says you've been
great with that girl.

31:28.415 --> 31:30.449
Bridgin' the generation gap.

31:30.517 --> 31:32.151
Miranda:
(Chuckles)

31:33.721 --> 31:35.354
Can I ask you something?

31:35.422 --> 31:36.656
Sure.

31:36.724 --> 31:39.092
This might sound odd.

31:39.159 --> 31:40.960
Um...

31:41.028 --> 31:43.795
What were Tim and Marion
like together?

31:44.764 --> 31:46.698
Oh, well...

31:46.766 --> 31:48.567
You know, things kinda
went off the rails

31:48.635 --> 31:50.436
after his accident there...

31:50.504 --> 31:52.471
No, I mean before that,
early on.

31:52.539 --> 31:55.941
Well, those were certainly
happier times.

31:56.009 --> 31:57.343
I still remember the day

31:57.410 --> 31:59.444
Tim asked for my permission
to marry her,

31:59.512 --> 32:03.348
right after he beat me
in a bull-dogging competition,

32:03.415 --> 32:05.250
if you can believe that.

32:05.317 --> 32:06.484
(Laughs)

32:06.552 --> 32:08.620
Yeah,
it sounds like Tim.

32:08.687 --> 32:11.356
<i>Jack: Well, he's always
had guts, I'll tell ya.</i>

32:11.423 --> 32:15.026
But I said they were too young,
they were too broke,

32:15.093 --> 32:16.826
and just...

32:16.894 --> 32:18.728
Too flat out different,

32:19.697 --> 32:22.266
but, of course,
he asked her anyway.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.801
Oh, it seems like Tim
and I have every reason

32:24.869 --> 32:26.637
to settle down,

32:27.705 --> 32:30.174
but I just feel that there's
something holding him back.

32:32.909 --> 32:36.245
Well...

32:36.313 --> 32:37.813
I think that uh...

32:40.250 --> 32:41.850
Well, the more serious
things get,

32:41.918 --> 32:44.620
I think the more scared
he gets.

32:47.123 --> 32:51.060
When he and Marion split,
it was ugly.

32:51.127 --> 32:53.128
<i>He pretty much lost all contact</i>
<i>with his girls,</i>

32:53.196 --> 32:54.763
<i>so that meant</i>
<i>that Amy and Lou,</i>

32:54.831 --> 32:58.133
they had to grow up
without their father.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.870
Now...

33:01.938 --> 33:04.605
I'm not sayin' that's
gonna happen with you guys,

33:04.673 --> 33:07.041
<i>it's just...</i>

33:07.109 --> 33:10.311
Maybe that's something
that he's hung up on.

33:11.279 --> 33:14.381
Why don't you just talk to him,

33:14.449 --> 33:17.185
make him see that there's
nothin' to worry about?

33:18.854 --> 33:19.886
Right.

33:25.359 --> 33:28.294
Caleb: Come on, get
up there, Denver.

33:28.362 --> 33:30.363
Amy:
You sure you wanna do this?

33:30.431 --> 33:32.532
Caleb: Trust me, this is
what he's meant to do.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.734
He's Denver,

33:33.801 --> 33:35.401
the horse that bucks
a mile high.

33:35.469 --> 33:37.469
Amy: You've already
got a slogan for him?

33:37.537 --> 33:38.838
I gotta hunch on this.

33:38.905 --> 33:40.873
You know, if Rich says
he's got potential,

33:40.941 --> 33:42.674
<i>I might buy him.</i>

33:42.743 --> 33:44.977
You know, maybe raising stock
could be a new career for me.

33:45.045 --> 33:46.678
Ty: Well, I have to admit
it's more in your ballpark

33:46.747 --> 33:48.114
than a yoga instructor.

33:48.181 --> 33:49.949
Amy:
(Chuckles)

33:50.016 --> 33:51.816
Good luck.

33:51.884 --> 33:53.184
(Denver snorts)

33:58.624 --> 34:00.258
(Metal gate clanks)

34:00.325 --> 34:02.393
Caleb:
Ho! Ungh!

34:02.461 --> 34:05.329
Onlookers: (Shout encouragement)
Nice, Caleb!

34:05.397 --> 34:06.364
Rich:
Take it on, Caleb!

34:06.431 --> 34:07.732
Amy:
Nice, Caleb!

34:07.799 --> 34:08.697
Jack: (Chuckling)
That a boy, Caleb!

34:08.766 --> 34:10.467
Rich:
All right! Nice!

34:11.870 --> 34:13.871
<i>Hang on! Hang on!</i>

34:13.938 --> 34:15.605
<i>Caleb: Whoa!</i>
<i>Shane: Hang on, Caleb!</i>

34:15.672 --> 34:17.107
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Yeah, Caleb!</i>

34:17.175 --> 34:18.475
Caleb:
(Grunts)

34:19.911 --> 34:22.913
Rich: Spur him hard,
spur him high!

34:22.981 --> 34:25.648
(Echoing snorts
and whinnies)

34:25.715 --> 34:27.817
Caleb:
Whoa! Whoa!

34:27.885 --> 34:29.385
(Grunts)

34:31.088 --> 34:31.954
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Good job!</i>

34:32.022 --> 34:33.188
<i>Look out!</i>

34:33.257 --> 34:34.657
Amy:
Whoa, Denver, whoa!

34:34.724 --> 34:36.292
Ty:
(Laughs)

34:36.359 --> 34:38.060
Jack:
Atta boy, Caleb!

34:38.128 --> 34:40.027
Shane:
Hey, that was awesome!

34:40.096 --> 34:41.196
Jack:
Good ride, Caleb!

34:41.264 --> 34:43.563
Caleb:
How was the horse?

34:43.632 --> 34:45.632
He has a real kick.

34:45.701 --> 34:46.634
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Well, he comes out strong,</i>

34:46.702 --> 34:47.803
doesn't go too far.

34:47.870 --> 34:49.704
Judges'll get a good look
at him.

34:49.772 --> 34:51.706
He was born to buck.

34:51.774 --> 34:53.408
<i>If I were you,</i>
<i>i'd go ahead and buy him</i>

34:53.475 --> 34:55.909
<i>and then I'd get him</i>
<i>some exposure on my circuit.</i>

34:55.976 --> 34:56.911
<i>You could take a horse</i>
<i>like that</i>

34:56.978 --> 34:58.913
down to that big auction
in Vegas,

34:58.980 --> 35:01.081
he could fetch up
to six figures.

35:01.149 --> 35:02.882
Ty and Caleb:
(Laugh)

35:02.950 --> 35:04.450
Caleb.

35:04.518 --> 35:05.718
You want a partner
in that horse?

35:05.786 --> 35:07.353
Caleb:
Naw, naw, you were right;

35:07.421 --> 35:09.923
You'd have to be crazy to buy
a horse that bucks like that.

35:09.990 --> 35:12.225
I've got crazy covered.

35:12.293 --> 35:13.960
<i>Rich:</i>
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

35:14.028 --> 35:16.930
You didn't see what you had
in that horse?

35:16.997 --> 35:18.263
Wow.

35:18.331 --> 35:19.811
You're kinda losin' your touch,
buddy.

35:20.499 --> 35:21.666
All:
(Chuckle)

35:32.411 --> 35:33.511
(Door opens)

35:33.579 --> 35:35.046
Tim:
(Chuckles) Hi.

35:35.113 --> 35:36.747
Miranda:
Hey, how was the river?

35:36.815 --> 35:40.017
Aw, you should've seen
the fish Dad caught.

35:40.085 --> 35:41.919
Yeah, and the horse
that got away.

35:41.987 --> 35:42.920
What?

35:42.988 --> 35:44.722
Oh, nothin'.

35:44.789 --> 35:45.990
Miranda: Shane, could you go get
some wood for the fireplace

35:46.058 --> 35:47.758
before it gets dark?

35:47.826 --> 35:48.792
Yeah, okay.

35:48.861 --> 35:50.894
Tim and Miranda:
Thanks.

35:50.962 --> 35:52.628
(Door opens and closes)

35:53.597 --> 35:54.898
He's having a great time.

35:54.966 --> 35:56.432
Yeah, he is.

35:57.401 --> 35:59.102
What about you?

36:00.604 --> 36:02.138
What? You still...

36:02.206 --> 36:04.047
Oh, you're still obsessing
about telling Shane?

36:04.108 --> 36:06.141
No. Well, sort of.

36:08.411 --> 36:11.646
I went up to the ranch today
and had a chat with Jack.

36:11.714 --> 36:12.748
Great.

36:14.951 --> 36:16.418
Great.

36:16.486 --> 36:18.187
So how was he runnin' me
down this time?

36:18.255 --> 36:21.323
No, it wasn't like that.

36:21.391 --> 36:24.492
Well, he obviously
said something.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.261
He thinks you're afraid
our relationship

36:26.328 --> 36:28.763
could screw up
what you have with Shane.

36:28.830 --> 36:30.464
What is he,
a psychologist now?

36:30.532 --> 36:32.700
Don't get all defensive.

36:32.768 --> 36:34.635
I actually get
where you're coming from.

36:34.703 --> 36:36.670
Where I'm coming from?!

36:37.672 --> 36:38.838
I never said that!

36:38.907 --> 36:41.108
Miranda:
No, but you're thinking it!

36:41.175 --> 36:42.809
And you're right,

36:42.877 --> 36:44.477
<i>why should we get</i>
<i>Shane's hopes up</i>

36:44.545 --> 36:47.281
if this could all come
to an end?

36:49.517 --> 36:52.219
Like it did with
you and Marion,

36:53.654 --> 36:56.923
<i>and like it did</i>
<i>with you and me.</i>

36:56.990 --> 36:57.890
That's enough.

36:57.958 --> 36:59.091
No.

37:00.794 --> 37:03.229
Imagine how it would
affect Shane

37:03.297 --> 37:06.399
if things didn't work out
between us.

37:07.634 --> 37:10.068
So what do you suggest
we do?

37:13.272 --> 37:14.472
<i>Miranda?</i>

37:27.018 --> 37:28.185
Ty:
Hey, there you are.

37:28.253 --> 37:29.486
All done.

37:29.554 --> 37:30.587
One less thing
for you to worry about.

37:30.655 --> 37:32.056
Well, that is
a good thing,

37:32.123 --> 37:33.991
'cause rich just went over
the itinerary

37:34.059 --> 37:37.194
and it looks like
I could be away for awhile.

37:37.262 --> 37:38.795
You're gonna have
a blast.

37:38.863 --> 37:39.896
Thanks for all your help.

37:39.965 --> 37:41.865
Any time, Jack,
any time.

37:41.933 --> 37:43.366
(Truck pulls up)

37:47.871 --> 37:49.105
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Jack.</i>

37:51.641 --> 37:54.577
Miranda told me
about your little chat.

37:54.644 --> 37:55.845
What're you talkin' about?

37:55.912 --> 37:58.480
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

37:58.547 --> 38:01.649
Look, Tim, she...
She put me on the spot and-.

38:01.717 --> 38:06.121
Yeah, well you crossed the line
this time, Jack.

38:06.189 --> 38:07.889
She dumped me.

38:14.191 --> 38:16.259
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>So I have some good news.</i>

38:16.327 --> 38:17.767
Denver's owner's willing
to sell him.

38:17.828 --> 38:19.629
Caleb:
Awesome! Thank you, Amy.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.699
Now I just have to figure out
how to pay back the bank loan.

38:22.766 --> 38:25.201
Amy:
Well, you could keep riding.

38:25.269 --> 38:26.301
You can still make
some good money

38:26.369 --> 38:28.103
on the circuit,
you know.

38:28.170 --> 38:29.804
Caleb: You know, I have to
admit, when that gate opened

38:29.872 --> 38:31.573
I realized that Denver
is not the only one

38:31.641 --> 38:33.108
who was born to buck.

38:33.175 --> 38:34.843
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Caleb, hey.</i>

38:34.910 --> 38:36.070
Grandpa's heading
out of town,

38:36.078 --> 38:37.478
so I need you
to pick up the slack -

38:37.513 --> 38:39.047
and you can start by fixing
the corral gate

38:39.115 --> 38:40.181
up at the dude ranch.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.416
Does that mean
I have my job back?

38:41.484 --> 38:43.117
Depends how fast
you fix that gate.

38:46.321 --> 38:47.688
(Chuckles)

38:59.667 --> 39:00.634
Well, you'll be happy
to hear

39:00.701 --> 39:02.636
I cleared things up
with Caleb.

39:02.703 --> 39:04.904
- He's back.
- Well, that's good.

39:04.972 --> 39:07.641
Tell him to use dry bedding
in those stalls.

39:07.708 --> 39:08.941
Got it.

39:09.009 --> 39:10.644
Make sure he keeps an eye
on those waters...

39:10.711 --> 39:12.579
- Right.
- 'Cause they could freeze up.

39:12.647 --> 39:13.580
Yes, of course.

39:13.648 --> 39:15.381
And that tractor,
it uh...

39:15.448 --> 39:17.650
It needs to be plugged in
overnight.

39:17.717 --> 39:20.519
Grandpa, we've got everything
under control.

39:20.587 --> 39:23.889
So just go and do your thing
and have some fun.

39:23.956 --> 39:25.291
(Chuckles)
Okay.

39:26.259 --> 39:27.499
Lou: Georgie!
Georgie: Hi, Remi!

39:27.527 --> 39:29.695
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Hey, you're home!</i>

39:29.763 --> 39:30.662
Hey, Jack!

39:30.729 --> 39:32.697
Jack:
(Chuckling) Hey!

39:32.765 --> 39:33.665
You weren't supposed
to be home

39:33.732 --> 39:34.965
for a couple of days!

39:35.033 --> 39:36.267
Well, one of the teachers
came home early

39:36.335 --> 39:38.269
so I got a ride with her.

39:38.337 --> 39:39.637
I think I've had
enough of camp.

39:39.705 --> 39:40.838
Oh, you missed us.

39:40.906 --> 39:42.407
Georgie:
(Laughs)

39:42.474 --> 39:45.075
You going somewhere, Jack?

39:45.143 --> 39:47.043
He's off
to Grand Prairie.

39:47.111 --> 39:48.412
Really?

39:48.479 --> 39:49.646
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Grandpa got a great new job</i>

39:49.714 --> 39:51.615
running some bronc riding
competitions.

39:51.683 --> 39:52.716
Georgie:
Oh.

39:54.151 --> 39:56.052
That sounds cool,
I guess.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.788
Hey, you know what?

39:58.756 --> 40:02.258
I bet it's not too late
to reschedule my whole trip.

40:02.326 --> 40:04.760
No, it's okay, Jack.

40:04.828 --> 40:05.795
You sure?

40:05.862 --> 40:07.596
Yes! I mean...

40:07.664 --> 40:09.432
I'll see you
when you get back.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.538
(Truck rumbles)

40:30.720 --> 40:31.919
Miranda, wait.

40:33.922 --> 40:35.956
You need to hear me out.

40:36.924 --> 40:37.958
Forget about
what Jack thinks,

40:38.025 --> 40:41.261
listen to what I think.

40:41.329 --> 40:43.096
I want us to go for it,

40:43.164 --> 40:45.098
be a couple,
tell Shane,

40:45.166 --> 40:46.500
the whole nine yards.

40:46.568 --> 40:50.503
It'll work out.
I can feel it in my gut.

40:51.472 --> 40:53.673
At the casino,

40:53.741 --> 40:58.510
people go with their gut
feelings all the time,

40:58.578 --> 40:59.611
but you never really know

40:59.679 --> 41:01.446
what cards
you're gonna be dealt.

41:04.417 --> 41:09.654
I'm not willing to gamble away
your relationship with Shane.

41:17.396 --> 41:18.996
Shane, come on,
let's go!

41:28.573 --> 41:29.573
Tim:
Hey.

41:31.275 --> 41:34.577
So, did you find out
what's up with that guy?

41:36.514 --> 41:38.915
Oh, there's no guy.

41:38.982 --> 41:40.349
That's a relief.

41:43.521 --> 41:44.554
Hey.

41:46.456 --> 41:47.823
Come here.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.167

Jack:
Okay.

42:20.155 --> 42:21.956
And you,
you be good.

42:25.726 --> 42:27.761
Georgie:
Oh, um, wait, Jack!

42:29.530 --> 42:32.032
I almost forgot,
you need to take this.

42:32.100 --> 42:35.068
Oh, did you record
another message for me?

42:35.135 --> 42:37.470
No. It's your turn;

42:37.537 --> 42:40.539
