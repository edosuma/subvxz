00:01.880 --> 00:02.881
Previously...

00:02.960 --> 00:04.405
Roger, I'm Claire Randall.

00:04.480 --> 00:05.925
I was an old friend of your father's.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.970
Brianna.
- A pleasure, Miss Randall.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.607
And I need to tell you
about your real father,

00:11.680 --> 00:13.011
Jamie Fraser.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.969
This Jacobite scum is Red Jamie.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.241
I can't even shoot the bastard,

00:16.320 --> 00:18.368
not without discrediting
my brother's sworn word.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.171
I lost a particular friend at Culloden.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.685
He inspired me.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.842
My wife, her name was Claire.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.122
I am sorry for your loss.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.444
It belonged to my mother.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.204
Very precious to me. As are you, Claire.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.643
I don't understand it,
but I believe you.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.086
I shall visit you once each quarter.
It's called Helwater.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.650
- You'll serve Lord Dunsany.
- Why?

00:41.720 --> 00:43.290
I didnae let ye have yer way.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.964
You gave me my life all those years ago.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.726
Now I give you yours.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.686
Sing me a song

00:50.760 --> 00:53.491
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.680 --> 00:56.411
Say, could that lass

00:56.480 --> 00:58.448
Be I?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.323
Merry of soul

01:01.400 --> 01:04.290
She sailed on a day

01:04.440 --> 01:06.647
Over the sea

01:06.720 --> 01:09.041
To Skye

01:09.680 --> 01:12.001
Billow and breeze

01:12.080 --> 01:14.845
Islands and seas

01:14.920 --> 01:19.528
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.280 --> 01:22.442
All that was good

01:22.760 --> 01:25.491
All that was fair

01:25.560 --> 01:27.562
All that was me

01:27.640 --> 01:30.086
Is gone

01:30.560 --> 01:32.847
Sing me a song

01:32.920 --> 01:35.764
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.840 --> 01:38.207
Say, could that lass

01:38.280 --> 01:39.964
Be I?

01:40.960 --> 01:43.247
Merry of soul

01:43.320 --> 01:46.085
She sailed on a day

01:46.240 --> 01:49.767
Over the sea

01:50.240 --> 01:55.451
To Skye

02:27.040 --> 02:28.963
So if our theory is correct,

02:29.040 --> 02:32.123
that Claire spent three years in the past,
and when she returned,

02:32.200 --> 02:33.440
three years had gone by here,

02:33.520 --> 02:37.570
it follows that time passes
at the same rate in both centuries.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.964
Since you've been home for 20 years,

02:40.040 --> 02:45.080
we have to establish that Jamie's alive
20 years after Culloden.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.407
So 1766.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.170
There's no record of him at the Toll booth.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.368
Nothing in Stirling either.
Or Arbroath or Blackness.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.243
You're sure they recorded
the names of every single prisoner?

02:59.040 --> 03:02.522
If Red Jamie was also the Dunbonnet
from Grannie's tales,

03:03.360 --> 03:04.964
he'd have been a very well-known outlaw.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.766
I always loved your grandmother's stories.
She was a very special friend to me.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.569
Will you have some cream
on your scone, Roger?

03:13.240 --> 03:14.241
You're much too thin.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.560
The Dunbonnet is only a legend.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.480
Even if such a person existed,
he was an outlaw.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.809
What's to say that Jamie was...

03:29.880 --> 03:30.961
I found him.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.490
Ardsmuir Prison.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.608
There he is, James Fraser.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.725
1753.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.686
'54. 1755.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.240
His name appears
on each of these annual rolls.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.207
But the prison closed in 1756.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.410
What happened to the prisoners?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.885
I don't know,
but this is cause for celebration, no?

04:02.880 --> 04:04.644
And it's never too early for a whisky.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.125
Welcome home, My Lord. Lady Dunsany.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.123
We pray that you're all in good health.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.962
Lady Geneva, Lady Isobel'
so good to see you home again.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.522
Good to be home, Mr Evans.
Italy was far too warm for my taste.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.726
I dare say, My Lady.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.163
I trust that all's been well whilst
we've been abroad, Mr Evans?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.441
Indeed, My Lord.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.841
I see that the new groomsman
is amongst us.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.001
Yes, My Lord.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.560
I must have a word with him.
Send him to the house, will you?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.804
Tell MacKenzie His Lordship
would like a word with him.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.126
Mr Evans says the master
wishes to speak with you.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.561
So you're the Scottish prisoner?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.491
Alexander MacKenzie.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.245
Your servant, My Lord.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.648
Major Grey disclosed to me
that you were a soldier

05:49.720 --> 05:51.961
and fought in the rising of '45.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.720
I did, My Lord.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.811
But he also told me
that you were an honourable man

05:57.880 --> 06:00.724
who spared his life before Prestonpans.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.001
I lost my only son there.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.049
Gordon was a young captain
in Bolton's regiment.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.722
Many good men were lost
to their families in the rebellion.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.926
On both sides.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.600
I respect a man who fights for his cause.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.726
Gordon gave his life for what he believed.
I take heart from this.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.291
You were defeated.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.963
Our quarrels are bygone.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.802
I cannot say that
Lady Dunsany feels the same.

06:35.880 --> 06:40.010
She carries a great hatred
for any Jacobite.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.447
She's never overcome Gordon's passing.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.009
The pain of losing
a child never leaves you.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.885
I've lost two children myself, My Lord.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.040
Well then...

07:08.040 --> 07:11.249
I'll simply tell Lady Dunsany
that you're a groom

07:11.320 --> 07:15.609
heartily recommended by Major Grey,
not a prisoner.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.651
You'll receive a small stipend
for your services.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.927
But you are a prisoner, MacKenzie.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.124
Mind you don't forget it.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.801
"Will you have some cream
on your scone, Roger?"

07:32.360 --> 07:34.124
You know she has a crush on you.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.641
Fiona?

07:36.360 --> 07:39.409
No. She just likes being helpful.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.565
You know, at first I thought

07:41.640 --> 07:43.404
maybe Fiona was your girlfriend.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.641
Girlfriend...

07:46.200 --> 07:48.771
Girlfriend? Fiona?

07:49.480 --> 07:54.327
No. I mean, I have girls who are friends,
but not one I'd call a...

07:54.400 --> 07:56.687
I don't... There's no...
I don't have a girlfriend.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.561
Move aside.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.808
All right. Try it now.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.121
Okay.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.481
What did you do?

08:24.800 --> 08:26.450
Distributor cap was loose.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.360
What do I owe you?

08:33.320 --> 08:34.481
I'll think of somethin'.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.448
MacKenzie. Time to draw straws.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.321
For?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.281
You'll see.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.371
Thanks, lads.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.680
I'm ready for my ride.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.725
I shall accompany you, My Lady.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.128
Fetch my palfrey. At once.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.726
Right away, My Lad?-

09:12.920 --> 09:15.366
Hurry up, you useless Scotchman.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.970
A boot on the hindquarters
is what that one needs.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.208
The horse? Or my sister?

09:37.840 --> 09:39.968
Pardon, My Lady. I meant...

09:40.040 --> 09:43.408
I know exactly what you meant.
But I doubt it would do her any good.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.963
May I saddle yer horse, My Lady?

09:50.600 --> 09:54.400
I only come down to look at the horses,
admire their beauty.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.089
Aye. They are magnificent.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.971
It pains me that my father
confines such splendid creatures.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.764
I've seen a great many stables.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.126
But Helwater's are by far the finest.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.525
A cage is still a cage.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.130
How long were you
in the employ of Lord John?

10:19.280 --> 10:24.207
I was under his charge
a wee bit over a year.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.642
I've known the Major
since we were youngsters.

10:28.240 --> 10:32.040
I find him to be a rare
and interesting person.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.201
I imagine he'll make someone
a good husband.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.724
Forgive me, My Lady, but...

10:38.920 --> 10:41.446
Military and marriage
are no easy bedfellows.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.846
The Major's passion lies in soldiering.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.201
His dedication to King and country

10:50.720 --> 10:53.246
is one of the things
I admire most about him.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.841
Wakefield residence.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.081
One moment please.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.846
It's the hospital in Boston.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.687
Hello. This is Dr Randall.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.966
Lady Jane.

11:22.760 --> 11:26.082
Joe. Well,
it is lovely to hear your voice.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.566
Guess what I'm eating.

11:27.640 --> 11:32.089
Well, let's see, it's Tuesday,
so it would only be chicken cacciatore.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.442
You may not miss me,
but I know you miss Jeveli's.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.366
Well, I miss both.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.603
So I'll make a reservation for two.
When should I say?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.001
Soon.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.289
What month is soon in?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.571
I can't say yet.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.289
Italian food aside, the reason I called,

11:53.400 --> 11:55.971
I saw Harry Greenbaum today
for abdominal pain.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.321
Harry?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.966
What did you find?

12:01.440 --> 12:04.410
Positive Murphy's sign
and calcifications on the X-ray.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.843
I scheduled the surgery for next week.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.609
You can handle it, Joe.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.641
Of course I can.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.485
But I'm just surprised you aren't
insisting on doing it yourself.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.724
Let me know how it goes.

12:21.760 --> 12:22.761
Goodbye, Joe.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.280
I can't tell you how pleased
I am with this arrangement.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.448
Geneva will be a fitting bride,
Your Lordship.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.491
We're certain this match will bring
good fortune to both our families.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.446
My sister advised me to seek in
marriage a lady less pettish.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.764
However, I find Geneva's
disposition appealing.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.047
My daughter will not disappoint you, sir.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.251
Am Ito wait all day?

12:55.520 --> 12:56.806
Almost finished, My Lord.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.161
My God, if a child of mine
had hair that colour,

12:59.240 --> 13:01.288
I'd drown him
before he drew his second breath.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.606
Farewell, my dearest.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.244
A mere fortnight until you're mine.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.881
I'm ready for my ride.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.766
MacKenzie, fetch my palfrey.
You will accompany me today.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.404
What do you think of my betrothed?

14:42.880 --> 14:44.370
The Earl of Ellesmere?

14:45.760 --> 14:48.366
It's not my place
to give an opinion, My Lady.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.681
I demand your opinion, MacKenzie.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.685
He appears fond of you.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.489
His most attractive quality is his wealth.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.528
What do you find attractive?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.924
I don't think of such things, My Lady.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.527
Liar.

15:13.880 --> 15:14.961
Aren't you coming?

15:16.880 --> 15:19.486
We should turn back. 'Fore it gets dark.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.525
We have time.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.569
Besides, you have to do my bidding.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.761
My Lady.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.808
I knew you'd do as I told you.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.967
I look forward to our next ride!

16:47.720 --> 16:49.484
King's pawn to king four.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.889
Queen's knight to bishop three.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.885
The Dunsanys are pleased with your work.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.482
So, even after all these months,

17:06.480 --> 17:09.244
ye've come all this way to Helwater
for the sake of my welfare?

17:11.079 --> 17:13.526
Or is it because ye cannae
find anyone else to play chess with?

17:14.920 --> 17:16.251
No one suitable.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.481
YES.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.320
Johnny.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.241
It appears my next move will have to wait.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.404
Colonel Melton,
you must remember MacKenzie?

17:40.760 --> 17:41.921
MacKenzie.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.641
YES.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.209
- Although it's been some time now.
- Aye.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.445
We are acquainted, My Lady.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.083
Major Grey was good enough
to recommend Mr MacKenzie to us.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.925
He's a master of the horses.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.850
If only he were as good with people
as he is with horses.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.683
How has your family managed without him?

18:05.480 --> 18:09.041
If it were up to me,
I would never have let such a man go.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.885
But then, I'm not my brother.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.322
Come, Lord Melton.
We have much to catch up on.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.848
Why don't we do it over
a game of cribbage?

18:24.920 --> 18:26.365
It would be my pleasure.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.567
Don't do that.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.286
Down.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.166
You needn't stand on ceremony
for my sake, MacKenzie.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.607
What are you doing?

19:20.920 --> 19:22.684
Shovelling shit, My Lady.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.367
Goodness.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.926
You understand I could have told my father
you dropped me in the mud.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.284
You're very fortunate
I have a merciful heart.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.921
Ave,

19:40.280 --> 19:41.725
very fortunate, My Lady.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.405
As you know, my wedding is in three days.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.491
I wish ye every happiness.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.129
Married to a man old enough
to be my grandsire?

19:52.840 --> 19:54.365
It's a vile agreement.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.847
Have you ever been married, MacKenzie?

20:01.520 --> 20:02.521
Aye.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.486
Then you'll know what to do.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.200
When you come to my bed.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.206
You've lost your mind.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.121
If ye had one to lose.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.730
How dare you speak that way to me.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.805
A lassie of breeding,

20:32.280 --> 20:34.567
making indecent proposals to a groom?

20:34.640 --> 20:36.244
I am damned if my maidenhead

20:36.320 --> 20:40.041
will be given to a depraved
old goat like Ellesmere.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.284
Good day to you, My Lady.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.841
I couldn't fathom why someone
of Major Grey's standing

20:51.920 --> 20:54.685
would spend so much time
with a common groom.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.126
Colonel Melton was tight-lipped at first,
but after a few...

21:02.320 --> 21:05.290
Well, quite a few glasses of port,

21:05.360 --> 21:09.410
I was able to coax
a very interesting tale from him.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.846
You shouldn't have done that.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.925
Mama would not be at all pleased
to know her groomsman is, in truth,

21:16.560 --> 21:19.086
a notorious Jacobite soldier

21:20.440 --> 21:23.489
who fought in the army
responsible for my brother's death.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.091
I'm very sure
she'd have your parole revoked,

21:28.920 --> 21:30.843
incarcerating you once again.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.160
Ye filthy wee bitch.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.364
That language suits you,

21:37.600 --> 21:38.806
Red Jamie.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.330
I'm sorry your brother died.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.601
Truly.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.046
But I'll not return to prison.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.005
You'd run back to Lallybroch?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.248
What a quaint little name.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.047
I suppose they would post soldiers.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.124
Come to my room.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.527
Tonight.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.720
I'm glad you came... Jamie.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.488
Having brought me to your bed
by means of threats against my family,

23:26.280 --> 23:28.009
I'll not have you call me
by the name they gave me.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.324
What must I call you then?

23:32.360 --> 23:33.361
Alex.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.166
'Tis my own name as well.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.166
You may disrobe.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.525
You can watch me if you'd like.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.207
It's all right.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.121
Doesn't hurt.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.325
Should get on with this then.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.367
May I touch you... My Lady?

25:27.480 --> 25:28.925
I don't know what to do.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.326
We don't have to do this.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.891
Change your mind if you want.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.441
No.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.924
I'm doing this for myself.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.049
I want my first time
to be with someone like you.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.041
Aye.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.411
The first time can often be...

26:01.240 --> 26:02.401
Vexing.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.330
Will you show me how it's done?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.091
Will it hurt much?

26:46.640 --> 26:47.641
I think not.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.766
If I take my time.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.325
May I touch you...

27:40.600 --> 27:41.806
There?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.291
Now move with me.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.371
Did I hurt you?

28:47.440 --> 28:49.124
It was painful at first.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.851
But then I liked it.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.968
I love you, Alex.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.529
It's not love, My Lady.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.281
It's just the feelings
I've roused in your body.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.006
It's strong.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.123
But it's not the same thing as love.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.443
What is the difference between them?

29:26.600 --> 29:27.681
This...

29:40.880 --> 29:42.086
What you feel for me now,

29:44.080 --> 29:45.730
you could have with any other man.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.326
It's not particular.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.811
Love is...

29:53.840 --> 29:56.286
When you give yer heart
and soul to another.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.884
And they give theirs in return.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.805
Pardon, Dr Randall,
I believe these belong to you.

31:11.960 --> 31:15.851
I gave these to Mrs Graham years ago.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.522
I never thought I would see these again.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.171
My grandmother told me
of your special friendship as well.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.765
She left the pearls to me, but...

31:26.440 --> 31:28.169
I know she'd want you to have them back.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.200
Thank you, Fiona.

31:33.920 --> 31:34.921
Truly.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.690
Hey! Good news.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.768
We just found out the National Archives

31:49.840 --> 31:53.367
has the most extensive collection
of ship manifests in the country.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.848
We can take the train
to Edinburgh tomorrow.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.771
That's wonderful, darling.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.284
Mama, are you all right?

32:06.160 --> 32:08.481
You haven't called me that in

32:09.000 --> 32:10.161
a very long time.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.844
I'm a terrible person.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.929
Finally, something we agree on.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.087
Ever since my mother told me about Jamie,

32:35.960 --> 32:38.964
it's like this wall between us
has started to come down.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.642
And now the closer
we get to finding him...

32:45.080 --> 32:46.491
I'm afraid of losing her.

32:52.520 --> 32:55.649
I think that just makes you a daughter
who cares about her mother.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.122
What if something happens to her there?

32:59.960 --> 33:01.325
What if she can't come back?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.760
Or... What if she doesn't want to?

33:05.120 --> 33:07.566
Well, if that makes you a terrible person,
then so am I.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.001
Part of me doesn't want
to find him either because...

33:14.360 --> 33:16.488
Well, once we do,
you'll go back to Boston.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.721
That was...

33:28.040 --> 33:29.087
Unexpected.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.804
Unexpected, yes.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.967
Mr MacKenzie!

33:51.680 --> 33:52.841
Mr MacKenzie!

33:56.560 --> 33:58.289
Get the horses and prepare the carriage.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.805
You must accompany us to Ellesmere.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.644
My sister, she's in distress.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.210
We've heard word
she's about to give birth.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.041
All is not well with her.
We must make haste.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.204
How is Lady Geneva?

35:02.280 --> 35:04.089
Shes still got the bleeding,
God bless her.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.441
And the child?

35:06.520 --> 35:08.409
He's a fine healthy boy.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.686
Are ye all right, My Lady?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.565
My sister's dead.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.850
We thought she'd be all right.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.006
She was sitting up,

35:51.200 --> 35:53.043
holding the baby, laughing.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.209
But then she started to bleed again.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.809
Physician did everything he could.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.083
Ellesmere knew the child wasn't his.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.521
I knew it too.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.921
Geneva told me
they had never shared a bed.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.650
Do not feign ignorance.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.285
She was in love with you.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.288
She said that you lay with her.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.802
She made me swear not to tell anyone.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.682
Your master is asking for you!
Come quickly! There's trouble!

36:39.160 --> 36:40.685
You promised me a virgin!

36:41.280 --> 36:42.611
What I got was a whore!

36:42.720 --> 36:44.131
How dare you?

36:44.400 --> 36:47.210
It's a bastard she's given me!

36:47.280 --> 36:51.968
And I'll not grieve for a woman
soiled by the cock of another man!

36:52.040 --> 36:54.566
That you can have the sheer
heartless effrontery

36:54.640 --> 36:55.926
to make such accusations!

36:56.320 --> 36:58.926
And my poor lamb not yet cold in her bed!

36:59.360 --> 37:01.601
You blackguard! You poltroon!

37:01.680 --> 37:04.411
You seem damn sure
of your daughter's purity!

37:04.480 --> 37:05.845
Are you certain the brat isn't yours?

37:07.480 --> 37:08.481
MY Lord!

37:10.200 --> 37:11.690
Hand me the pistol.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.522
We shall put our weapon down,
but we need you to do the same, sir.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.521
Please.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.891
For the baby.

37:50.840 --> 37:54.731
Your Lordship, let us take the child
so that you may mourn in peace.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.325
You will go.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.528
We're not leaving here without the baby!

37:58.600 --> 38:00.090
Go to hell!

38:00.160 --> 38:02.686
I'll kill the bastard
before I let you have him!

38:53.640 --> 38:54.721
MacKenzie.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.167
Lady Isobel.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.041
How is the wee one?

39:10.640 --> 39:11.721
We named him William.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.521
After my father.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.725
I call him Willie.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.645
'Tis a fine name.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.290
I must apologise.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.361
I was

39:39.840 --> 39:41.490
very angry that morning,

39:42.200 --> 39:43.531
mad with grief.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.846
I needed someone to blame,
but it wasn't your fault.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.806
My sister was a difficult woman

39:53.800 --> 39:55.086
and you were kind to her.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.765
You're a braw laddie...

40:26.160 --> 40:27.161
Willie.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.726
You're so wee.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.801
Dinna fash yerself.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.250
I am here.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.126
I asked Isobel to allow us a moment.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.764
The coroners court has met.

40:53.480 --> 40:57.371
The verdict is that the Earl of Ellesmere
met his death

40:58.600 --> 40:59.726
by misadventure.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.847
The coroners theory was that he was

41:03.720 --> 41:04.801
distraught

41:05.800 --> 41:07.564
over his wife's sudden death

41:07.920 --> 41:09.809
and therefore met his own end.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.647
We're very grateful to you, Mr MacKenzie.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.205
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.210
I know who you are.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.366
Not your name,

41:24.360 --> 41:26.966
but that you were one
of Major Grey's Jacobite prisoners.

41:30.160 --> 41:33.369
I hope you
forgive the deception, Your Ladyship.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.800
My husband
has considerable influence in London.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.970
I'm sure he would speak on your behalf

41:42.320 --> 41:45.449
to have you released
from the conditions of your parole.

41:46.800 --> 41:47.847
So...

41:48.840 --> 41:50.080
I've come to ask you...

41:51.640 --> 41:52.846
Would you like to go home,

41:53.640 --> 41:54.641
to Scotland?

41:57.560 --> 42:00.530
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.565
But I will not go

42:13.040 --> 42:14.041
Just yet.

42:14.760 --> 42:15.761
Why not?

42:17.880 --> 42:19.166
Times are hard there.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.011
And I've been able to send
some money back for my family.

42:26.560 --> 42:31.043
I would like to continue in your service,
if you have no objection.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.729
As you wish, Mr MacKenzie.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.484
But when you are ready to leave,

42:37.040 --> 42:38.485
you have only to ask.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.121
That's it, Willie.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.251
Keep yer back straight.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.321
That's it.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.321
Shorten yer reins a bit.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.244
The young Earl of Ellesmere is a handsome
little boy and such a lovely rider.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.087
Yes, Willie loves his pony.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.760
That's it, heels down.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.606
Aye, ye're a natural.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.284
We joke sometimes that he spends
so much time with MacKenzie,

43:37.360 --> 43:39.203
he's starting to look like him.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.960
Why, you're right. How funny.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.722
All right, help me wipe it down.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.441
Here's the last of them.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.366
Roger, what are these?

44:33.880 --> 44:36.121
Ship manifests, but...

44:36.200 --> 44:38.487
But the dates, they're all wrong.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.125
1635.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.601
1636.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.400
Wait, all of them?

44:53.480 --> 44:55.562
It's off by over a hundred years.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.087
There must be a mistake.

44:57.160 --> 44:58.685
Let me check.

45:03.240 --> 45:06.084
Excuse me,
I was looking for ship manifests

45:06.160 --> 45:08.128
from the period of 1757.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.567
Sorry, we've given you everything we have.

45:19.480 --> 45:22.006
She said those were
the only manifests they have.

45:29.400 --> 45:30.401
Christ.

45:31.240 --> 45:36.201
"But bring a Scotchman frae his hill,
clap in his cheek a Highland gill,

45:36.280 --> 45:38.760
"say, such is royal George's will..."

45:39.040 --> 45:42.761
Robbie Burns.
The old bard knew how to turn a phrase.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.369
Why are people staring at us?

45:47.480 --> 45:51.007
'Cause we are not supposed to be
sitting at the bar, you and I.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.206
What are you talking about?
There's a woman right there.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.450
Well, that's the entertainment.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.725
Maybe we could move to the other lounge
where women are more...

45:59.800 --> 46:00.801
Accepted.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.764
This is 1968.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.328
And we have as much right
to sit here as any man.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.801
"But tell me whisky's name in Greek,
I'll tell the reason."

46:09.760 --> 46:10.761
"Scotland..."

46:10.840 --> 46:12.285
It was just a little setback.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.808
We can always go to every port of call
on the western coast.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.405
There must be records.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.166
We will find him.

46:20.840 --> 46:23.684
"Freedom and whisky gang thegither!

46:23.800 --> 46:25.370
"Take aff your dram!"

46:25.440 --> 46:26.646
Hey.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.849
"Freedom and whisky."

46:34.200 --> 46:36.009
I used to quote that to Jamie.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.244
And you will again, Mama.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.165
Look. We are not giving up.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.128
But this is what
Mrs Graham warned me about.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.561
Spending my life chasing a ghost.

46:59.720 --> 47:01.006
To all of those

47:02.360 --> 47:03.566
we have lost.

47:25.720 --> 47:27.404
It's time to go home.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.211
It's time for me to go home.

47:33.280 --> 47:35.931
What do you mean, Mac? This is your home.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.246
This is your home.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.561
Where are you going? For how long?

47:42.040 --> 47:43.087
Back to Scotland.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.970
I want to come with you.
I could ride Rosie.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.166
No.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.607
And I've told ye a thousand times,
she's too big for ye just yet.

47:49.720 --> 47:52.530
You have to do what I tell you.
I'm your master.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.803
I suspect "no" is a word
you've not heard much of,

47:55.560 --> 47:57.688
but you'll hear it in the world
and you best get used to it.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.400
Willie!

47:59.520 --> 48:00.521
No!

48:01.360 --> 48:02.850
I told you, no.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.161
I hate you!

48:06.240 --> 48:08.641
And I'm not very fond of you
either just now, ye wee bastard.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.371
I'm not a bastard! Take it back!

48:14.760 --> 48:15.886
I take it back.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.485
I should never have used the word.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.125
I'm sorry... My Lord.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.125
Must you truly go, Mac?

48:54.920 --> 48:57.446
Tea will be served shortly.
Shall we go to the house?

48:58.360 --> 48:59.486
I shall follow directly.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.691
I'd like a moment with MacKenzie.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.444
I hear Willie is most displeased with you.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.290
You told him you were leaving?

49:17.360 --> 49:18.361
Aye.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.564
I'll be sorry lo lose my chess partner.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.046
But you are right to go.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.605
We all have our secrets.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.720
Yours is walking around.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.529
Anyone with half an eye can see it.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.804
Some sires stamp their get.

49:45.480 --> 49:48.768
The boy has the same cock to his head,
same set to his shoulders,

49:48.880 --> 49:50.120
and he has your eyes.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.642
It won't be long before
young Willie sees it himself.

50:02.440 --> 50:03.771
Will you walk with me?

50:10.680 --> 50:14.321
I wish to ask a favour of ye.

50:15.560 --> 50:17.449
If you think I'll tell anyone, I won't.

50:17.520 --> 50:19.727
No, no, I dinna think ye would.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.760
But I would ask...

50:24.120 --> 50:25.724
Would you look out for Willie?

50:26.760 --> 50:29.604
It would mean a great deal to me
if you would spend time with him,

50:30.480 --> 50:31.481
serve

50:31.960 --> 50:33.041
as his father.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.768
In return, if you want...

50:39.880 --> 50:41.041
I would be willing to...

50:47.240 --> 50:48.241
If you want.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.168
Are you actually offering
your body to me in payment

50:53.240 --> 50:54.651
if I promise to look after Willie?

50:57.080 --> 50:58.081
Aye.

51:01.720 --> 51:02.721
Dear God.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.403
That I should live to hear such an offer!

51:11.200 --> 51:12.201
Ye dinna want me then?

51:12.600 --> 51:15.251
Well, I shall probably want you
till the day I die, but...

51:16.400 --> 51:18.721
Tempted as I am,
do you really think I would accept?

51:20.160 --> 51:21.924
Well, I should feel my honour
most insulted

51:22.000 --> 51:24.241
save that I know
the depth of feeling that prompted it.

51:25.560 --> 51:27.210
I came to tell you some news of my own.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.080
I am to be married.

51:30.680 --> 51:31.681
Married?

51:32.800 --> 51:33.801
To a woman?

51:34.720 --> 51:36.563
I think there are not many alternatives.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.042
But yes, since you ask,

51:39.960 --> 51:40.961
to Lady Isobel.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.971
Christ, man, ye cannae do that.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.041
Loan.

51:44.720 --> 51:46.848
I made trial of my capacity in London.

51:46.920 --> 51:49.127
Be assured I shall make her
an adequate husband.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.407
Besides, there is more
to a marriage than carnal love.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.923
I'm also truly fond of Isobel.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.928
Well, then,
I have no right to think ill of you,

52:04.920 --> 52:06.729
if you mean no dishonour to the Lady.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.161
Certainly not.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.001
Besides...

52:11.440 --> 52:13.681
It means I will be able
to care for Willie.

52:23.480 --> 52:24.720
I'm grateful to you.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.851
And you shall always

52:34.760 --> 52:36.125
have my friendship.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.567
If that has any value to ye.

52:43.320 --> 52:44.765
A very great value indeed.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.405
Willie.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.641
What are ye doing?

53:09.120 --> 53:10.246
Does yer governess know ye're here?

53:10.320 --> 53:13.529
I wanted to see you.
Can't I stay for a bit?

53:15.720 --> 53:16.721
For a bit.

53:26.160 --> 53:30.563
Grandmama says only stinkin' Papists
burn candles in front of heathen images.

53:32.920 --> 53:33.921
Well...

53:35.000 --> 53:36.684
lam a stinking Papist.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.566
But that's no heathen image.

53:39.600 --> 53:40.931
That's St. Anthony,

53:41.520 --> 53:43.249
the patron saint of lost things.

53:44.760 --> 53:47.366
I light a candle,

53:48.400 --> 53:49.970
pray for the ones I've lost.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.165
Who do you pray for?

53:55.280 --> 53:56.281
My brother.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.360
He's called Willie

54:00.320 --> 54:01.321
like you.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.966
And my sister,

54:06.360 --> 54:07.646
my godfather...

54:09.320 --> 54:10.321
My wife.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.170
You haven't a wife.

54:13.880 --> 54:14.927
Not any more.

54:16.680 --> 54:18.250
But I remember her.

54:21.440 --> 54:22.441
Always.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.448
One day, you

54:26.520 --> 54:27.885
will have a wife of yer own.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.244
I don't want a wife.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.206
Trust me, lad.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.649
There's a woman out there for ye.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.724
Ye'll find her one day.

54:39.040 --> 54:40.087
Or...

54:41.400 --> 54:42.845
She will find you.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.366
I want to be a stinkin' Papist too.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.525
No, yer granny would go mad.

54:49.640 --> 54:53.281
I won't tell her. Please, Mac.
I want to be like you.

55:01.760 --> 55:02.841
I baptise thee

55:03.960 --> 55:05.325
William James,

55:05.560 --> 55:10.566
in the name of our Father
and of the Son and the Holy Ghost.

55:11.200 --> 55:13.965
Why did you call me William James?

55:14.160 --> 55:17.289
My name is
William Clarence Henry George Ransom.

55:17.720 --> 55:19.722
When you're christened,
you get a new name.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.560
James is your

55:23.000 --> 55:25.321
special Papist name.

55:26.560 --> 55:27.561
It's mine too.

55:28.160 --> 55:30.003
I'm a stinking Papist now.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.804
And I carved this...

55:33.880 --> 55:34.881
For ye.

55:36.080 --> 55:39.368
My brother, Willie,
gave me one just like it.

55:40.720 --> 55:43.166
I etched your name on the bottom, see.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.365
You keep it to remember me by.

55:50.440 --> 55:53.489
And for God's sake,
don't tell anyone you're a Papist.

55:53.560 --> 55:54.686
I won't.

55:54.760 --> 55:57.923
But I haven't got anything
for you to remember me.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.606
Dinna fash, lad.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.406
I'll remember you.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.650
We'll take good care of your son.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.441
- Mac! Please, don't go!
- Willie!

57:26.520 --> 57:27.646
Come back!

57:28.640 --> 57:29.971
Mac!
