<i>[Hilda] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.702 --> 00:05.899
I love you, Hilda,
and I want you to be my wife.

00:06.373 --> 00:09.137
Any preference for how
we make your old man disappear?

00:09.209 --> 00:11.200
Six months you'll run
Meade Publications.

00:11.277 --> 00:12.369
That's the idea.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.436
I'm divorcing Claire.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.574
You slut.
Stay away from my husband!

00:17.650 --> 00:20.118
- I'm so sorry.
- I love you.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.644
He's my boyfriend,
so back off, Betty.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.125
- I'm gonna fight for Henry.
- You're not the one in charge.

00:27.193 --> 00:30.094
I am the one with pupils
that aren't the size of quarters.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.329
Left my wallet in the bedroom,
just a second.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.594
Hey, what the...

00:35.001 --> 00:37.162
- I won't be going home with you.
- What?

00:37.237 --> 00:39.569
They denied my visa.

00:47.881 --> 00:52.443
Henry, hi. It's me.
Betty... sorry.

00:52.519 --> 00:56.353
I never know at what point you can say
"It's me" and the other person knows.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.948
Anyhow, I'm back from Mexico

00:59.025 --> 01:02.722
And I really need to talk to you.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.196
So, just give me a ringle.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.257
I mean a jing. I'm sorry
I'm combining jingle and ring.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.199
Just call me. Thanks.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.269
Learn to talk!

01:12.972 --> 01:16.237
- Hi!
- Hey, how's Dora the Explorer?

01:16.309 --> 01:19.142
Your trip good?
Everything work out with your father?

01:19.212 --> 01:21.578
There were problems.
He's still in Mexico.

01:21.648 --> 01:25.015
Everything's going to be OK.
We spoke to the lawyer this morning

01:25.085 --> 01:28.213
and he'll be home soon.
Hey, I brought you something.

01:28.955 --> 01:31.583
Oh, Betty, you shouldn't have.

01:31.658 --> 01:34.889
- Oh, I didn't. This is for Henry.
- Lucky guy.

01:34.961 --> 01:37.191
This... is for you.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.864
A rock, wow.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.525
It's supposed to be mystical.

01:41.601 --> 01:45.970
The man who sold it to me said it will
help on your journey of enlightenment.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.530
Or with cramps, my Spanish really sucks.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.542
I know how hard you've been working

01:50.610 --> 01:54.102
on cleaning yourself up, so here.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.047
Yeah, that's me.
All cleaned up.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.948
Daniel, are you wearing makeup?

01:59.018 --> 02:02.044
A guy can't wear a little concealer
without being judged?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.885
- Come on.
- You have a black eye.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.390
How did that happen?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.393
Did Alexis do this to you?
I've only been gone for a week!

02:08.461 --> 02:10.929
No, it wasn't Alexis. Um...

02:10.997 --> 02:12.988
It happened last night...

02:13.066 --> 02:16.593
...I saved this kid
who fell in the lake in Central Park.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.338
- What?
- I saw this little girl,

02:19.405 --> 02:22.841
it was a Girl Scout and she had fallen
in the lake by the boat house,

02:22.909 --> 02:26.174
I dove in and hit my head on a rock
and pulled her out. That was it.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.647
- Where are we ordering lunch from?
- Wait, Daniel.

02:29.716 --> 02:33.015
You saved somebody's life?
You're a hero.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.385
OK! OK, it's over.
I did my good deed for the year.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.254
You know what?
I have something else for Henry.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.883
You deserve this.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.962
<i>Gracias.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here

02:54.274 --> 02:56.674
I thought I smelled jewelry.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.938
What is that?

02:59.012 --> 03:02.880
That is my way of thanking you for
giving me a second chance at happiness.

03:04.384 --> 03:08.787
Wilhelmina, will you spend
the rest of your life with me?

03:08.855 --> 03:12.552
Oh, Bradford, you know I will.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.724
Oh, my.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.697
It's a big flower, isn't it?

03:23.770 --> 03:25.863
I designed it myself.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.773
It represents
how our love has bloomed.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.177
- Happy?
- Deliriously.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.219
It's like I'm in a fairy tale.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.050
And you are my beautiful princess.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.520
Homewrecking slut.

03:51.598 --> 03:54.567
She's the reason Bradford
sent those divorce papers.

03:54.634 --> 03:58.001
Shut it, fish.
Just stack up another set of quarters.

03:58.938 --> 04:03.102
Forgive me, but are you sure

04:03.176 --> 04:06.145
you don't want to retain
just a dash

04:06.212 --> 04:08.373
of your femininity?

04:08.448 --> 04:10.382
Rough and beautiful.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.648
Look, you said you would help me.

04:14.721 --> 04:17.053
My husband won't take my calls,
won't see me.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.523
If I could get to him,
I could save my marriage.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.889
Relax, fish, all right?

04:20.959 --> 04:23.895
It's going down tomorrow
when they transfer us upstate.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.123
Four of us in that van.

04:25.198 --> 04:30.067
You, me, Chartreuse,
and Sugarfree Shirley.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.970
The diabetic?

04:35.041 --> 04:38.135
That sweet thing is
gonna be the key to our plan.

04:41.247 --> 04:45.809
Hello. It's Alexis Meade. I need to know
when you'll be taking care of

04:45.885 --> 04:48.718
the situation with my father.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.483
This waiting is freaking me out.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.956
<i>[Man] I told you,
it'll happen when it happens.</i>

04:53.026 --> 04:56.655
<i>The less you know, the better.
Don't be stupid enough to call me again.</i>

04:58.231 --> 05:01.394
- Have you heard the news?
- Is it my father? What happened?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.765
No. It's Daniel.

05:03.836 --> 05:07.670
This Girl Scout fell in a lake in
Central Park and Daniel saved her.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.641
He even hit his head on a rock
and got a black eye.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.304
Really? Daniel did that?

05:13.379 --> 05:16.507
Look, I know things between
you two have been a little rough.

05:16.582 --> 05:20.450
I know you think he's a total screw up,
but he is a really good person.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.320
You're right.
Sometimes I do forget that.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.692
I think we should acknowledge
his heroic efforts, don't you?

05:28.761 --> 05:32.959
Cupcakes! Or something even
more special like one big cake.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.159
Maybe we can go even bigger.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.900
- We should have a press conference.
- Yeah! OK!

05:39.972 --> 05:41.963
I'll get right on it.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.587
[Imitates bird cawing]

05:58.658 --> 05:59.682
Where've you been?

05:59.759 --> 06:02.091
Waiting for Christina
to go to the bathroom.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.857
That woman retains water
like a two-humped camel.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.297
Speaking of humps,
I think I discovered

06:07.367 --> 06:10.825
what dear old Fey Sommers used
this secret room for.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.002
- Look.
- No.

06:15.074 --> 06:18.066
Either that or she had
a unique take on casual Fridays.

06:18.144 --> 06:21.409
You don't think Fey and Bradford
would sneak in here and...

06:21.581 --> 06:23.913
Thank you for that image.
Now every time I look,

06:23.983 --> 06:27.749
I'll picture him trussed up like a goose
with a ball gag in his mouth.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.653
Inhale Ricky Martin,
exhale Colin Farrell.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.521
I still can't get over this place.

06:33.593 --> 06:36.289
It is like four times
the size of my studio.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.353
OK, we tell no one about this.

06:38.431 --> 06:42.629
Except for the occasional delivery guy
who we lure in to open his packages.

06:42.702 --> 06:46.468
You are a very bad boy.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.368
- Again.
- Bad boy.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.965
- Again.
- Bad boy.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.442
- Again.
- OK, this is creepy, even for us.

06:53.379 --> 06:57.873
Can you believe it?
That pathetic loser stole my story.

06:57.950 --> 06:58.939
Your story?

06:59.018 --> 07:02.852
When I was 14, I was the one who rescued
a kid from drowning in Central Park.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.117
I even hit my head on a rock.

07:05.191 --> 07:08.422
So, how do you think
Daniel got that shiner?

07:09.128 --> 07:10.823
Beats me.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.695
But something tells me
he won't want it in the press.

07:19.071 --> 07:22.598
- Daniel! Hi. What are those?
- Just a mint.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.303
- I've never seen them so small...
- There's Henry.

07:25.378 --> 07:29.314
Why don't you go make
awkward small talk with your friend?

07:29.382 --> 07:31.714
Oh, my God.
Give me a mint.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.581
What? No, you don't need one.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.450
Daniel, I just had an onion bagel.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.979
Betty, your breath...
is fresh as a daisy.

07:46.532 --> 07:47.931
Hi.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.399
Oh, hi.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.267
OK, "ringle" is my new favorite word.

07:52.338 --> 07:56.468
And, for the record, I know it's you
when you say "It's me."

07:57.210 --> 07:59.576
Thanks.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.840
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.013
Somewhere private?

08:08.721 --> 08:10.484
OK, I have something to tell you

08:10.556 --> 08:14.754
and then I'm probably gonna throw up,
so I'm apologizing in advance.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.193
Could we please just have one minute?

08:17.263 --> 08:18.855
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

08:19.599 --> 08:22.500
I did a lot of thinking...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.997
I did a lot of thinking
while I was in Mexico,

08:29.075 --> 08:32.169
and I realized you rarely get
everything you want in life,

08:32.245 --> 08:34.212
but if you don't fight for it then...

08:34.280 --> 08:35.871
...you have even less of a chance.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.780
So, here I am... fighting...

08:40.052 --> 08:41.178
...for you.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.121
- Wow.
- You're still with Charlie, but...

08:44.190 --> 08:47.990
OK, seriously,
just 30 more seconds, please?

08:48.761 --> 08:50.922
I think you and I would be amazing.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.465
We know what the other one's thinking,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.127
and we always laugh at the same things.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.467
You make my mouth go dry
every time you walk into a room.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.002
- Betty...
- The only thing I ask,

09:02.074 --> 09:04.338
when you reject me, do it quick.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.469
Like ripping a Band-Aid off.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.843
Off of my heart.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.174
I broke up with Charlie.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.741
What?

09:13.819 --> 09:17.585
Will you forget the stupid copies?
There are lives going on in here!

09:19.325 --> 09:22.385
- You were saying?
- She's not the one for me, Betty.

09:23.162 --> 09:25.426
There's someone else...

09:25.498 --> 09:27.762
...that makes my mouth go dry.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.763
Who is hogging the... [gasps]

09:29.835 --> 09:33.794
<i>- Eww! Dorkus interruptus.
- Get out!</i>

09:35.341 --> 09:39.038
Hey everyone!
Betty's in heat.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.946
This isn't exactly how I pictured this.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.382
You're right.

09:46.452 --> 09:50.047
- We need to have a real date.
- Our first date?

09:50.122 --> 09:51.646
The first date.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.722
[Man] Is that the guy
who looks like C-3PO?

09:57.797 --> 10:00.561
- Is tomorrow night at 8:00 OK?
- That's great.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.399
OK.

10:35.334 --> 10:39.134
Don't put that in your mouth, I just
cleaned my nails with it... kidding.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.065
They're totally sterile.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.167
So, Betty Suarez.
You're Dr. Farkas' patient?

10:45.244 --> 10:48.008
Yeah, but I'm just here today
for a cleaning.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.015
I have my first date tonight
with a guy I'm crazy about

10:51.083 --> 10:52.744
and I want my teeth to sparkle.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.083
Oh, my God. That is so romantic.

10:56.155 --> 11:00.319
<i>It's like when Julia Roberts flossed
before whoring herself in Pretty Woman.</i>

11:00.393 --> 11:03.658
Such a great movie.
And an important message.

11:03.729 --> 11:07.961
OK, I just checked her file.
She had a cleaning two months ago.

11:08.034 --> 11:11.026
Her insurance will only cover this
every six months.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.936
Oh, rinse and spit, Angelica.
Just put it through.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.965
Where's your sense of romance?
She's doing this for the man she loves.

11:18.044 --> 11:22.208
- We should give you pink rubber bands.
- Oh, yeah, that would be really fun.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.545
Dentistry is not about fun.

11:24.617 --> 11:29.145
You always think you can bend all the
rules because you're pretty and blond.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.583
Is she OK?

11:30.656 --> 11:34.717
She's just mad because we had a nitrous
party here and didn't invite her!

11:34.794 --> 11:38.560
- That was unethical and costly.
- Back to your cage, Shrek!

11:38.631 --> 11:40.360
Don't worry about her.

11:40.433 --> 11:44.096
Just believe in the magic.
You are totally Bridget Jones!

11:44.170 --> 11:46.764
Did you see that movie?
That is such a great movie.

11:46.839 --> 11:49.603
I mean one. Two was a little... ehh!
Let me see.

11:50.443 --> 11:55.506
Yep, looks like we have a little cavity
on Mr. Lower Left Six.

11:55.581 --> 11:58.573
We can get you Novocained up
and a dentist here in two secs.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.050
No. No.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.054
No, no Novocain, please.
I'll come back tomorrow.

12:04.123 --> 12:08.526
It's just that if my lips
are gonna be tingly tonight...

12:09.528 --> 12:11.587
...I want it to be because of Henry.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.625
You are such a chick flick.

12:15.701 --> 12:18.169
I would totally pay $12 to see you.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.795
- Really?
- Yes.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.733
- You don't like the white?
- No, I like the white.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.778
- So, what's wrong with the red?
- I'm gonna eat a cupcake.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.280
Mom? Can you run lines with me?

12:29.348 --> 12:31.680
In case something bad
happens to Joey Colano

12:31.751 --> 12:34.242
and I have to go on as Tony.
I am his understudy...

12:34.320 --> 12:38.256
<i>Forget about West Side Story for two
minutes, I'm trying to plan a wedding.</i>

12:38.324 --> 12:40.724
Right, best man.
What, you don't want to help?

12:40.793 --> 12:44.024
I told Mom if she went with
green organza for the bridesmaids,

12:44.096 --> 12:46.030
she was on her own.

12:46.098 --> 12:49.158
OK, I'm thinking we do this
at Our Lady of Guadalupe church,

12:49.235 --> 12:51.465
next to the gas station.

12:51.537 --> 12:54.335
See if we can get Fat Louie
or Bad Skin Louie to DJ.

12:54.406 --> 12:59.070
I want St. Patrick's Cathedral and the
Harlem Boys Choir releasing doves.

12:59.145 --> 13:02.706
Tia Consuela's House of Pork and Beans
is giving us a deal on a buffet!

13:02.782 --> 13:06.616
And the medallions of lamb should be
followed by the foie gras en terrine.

13:06.685 --> 13:10.746
Book Mario Testino. Have him photograph
the whole thing in sepia tones.

13:10.823 --> 13:15.226
And we put one of these on every table,
and bam, the whole wedding's covered!

13:15.294 --> 13:16.556
I love you.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.494
I love me.

13:18.697 --> 13:23.031
Wow, I walk away for a hot second
and you look five years younger.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.799
- Woman, are you aging backwards?
- What happened?

13:26.872 --> 13:31.434
Little glitch. Teeny, tiny,
Cindy Crawford mole-sized problem.

13:31.510 --> 13:35.844
It looks like St. Patrick's Cathedral's
already booked on June 16th.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.281
- What?
- What do you get from St. Patrick's?

13:38.350 --> 13:41.683
Bad incense and
a bunch of guilty men in dresses.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.952
Wilhelmina Slater is marrying Bradford
Meade. This wedding has to be an event.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.858
That's the only date that works.
Bump the other bride.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.759
Actually, it's, um...

13:51.497 --> 13:54.432
...our top advertiser, Fabia.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.368
Fabia? That little Euro-wench
is getting married?

13:58.437 --> 14:01.133
And she got Elton John
to sing for the wedding.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.869
<i>He's rewritten Candle in the Wind
just for her.</i>

14:03.943 --> 14:06.503
<i>What? He was rewriting
Candle in the Wind for me!</i>

14:06.579 --> 14:09.446
Give that queen $20
and she'll rewrite it for anybody.

14:09.515 --> 14:14.384
Get Fabia over here.
Wedding Summit '07... is on!

14:16.088 --> 14:18.784
Daniel! Please follow me.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.588
There's someone in your office
I'd like you to meet.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.128
What's that look?
You've got that look.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.596
What, you think you know my looks?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.059
Surprise!

14:30.603 --> 14:32.764
That's so sweet, you know my looks.

14:32.838 --> 14:35.466
- What is all this?
- You saved a Girl Scout.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.510
You're being honored.
You could use the good press.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.705
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Daniel Meade,

14:41.780 --> 14:43.975
<i>fashion editorlhero.</i>

14:47.253 --> 14:49.414
- This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.581
I don't know what to say...

14:51.657 --> 14:54.387
Start by letting everyone
know the exact details

14:54.460 --> 14:56.928
of how you saved the kid in the lake.

14:56.996 --> 15:00.523
I saw this Girl Scout, she
fell in the lake and I saved her.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.999
- What time of day?
- Morning.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.595
- Wouldn't she be in school?
- Maybe she was skipping.

15:06.672 --> 15:10.699
- Do Girl Scouts skip school?
- [All] No!

15:11.644 --> 15:13.077
And how'd you hit your head?

15:13.145 --> 15:16.672
Just slipped on the rocks
when I was getting out of the lake.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.616
I thought you hit your head
as you dove in.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.518
I think he's lying. Is it good to lie?

15:22.588 --> 15:25.056
[Girls] No!

15:25.124 --> 15:27.319
[Shutters clicking]

15:40.739 --> 15:43.469
Would you help me up?

15:46.145 --> 15:49.205
Give me one reason why I should do this.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.177
$50,000 deposited
in your daughter's account.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.083
Take the candy bar, please.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.385
Nice work, bitch.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.395
What happened to "Fish"?

16:04.463 --> 16:07.990
"Fish" becomes "Bitch" after two weeks.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.928
Oh, my God, you got beat up
by a drug dealer?

16:14.006 --> 16:17.703
Look, he just took some money
and one very expensive watch

16:17.776 --> 16:21.075
which I really didn't like anyway.
But that's it, I'm fine.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.479
- It's not like I'm gonna use him again.
- Use him?

16:24.550 --> 16:26.950
Daniel, what about the drugs?

16:27.019 --> 16:29.180
Come on, it's more like medicine.

16:29.254 --> 16:34.021
Except I buy it from a guy who has
a shaved head and a neck tattoo.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.688
Don't look at me like that.
I'm still able to work.

16:37.763 --> 16:40.459
I'm not using sex to avoid my problems.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.932
You're using drugs
to avoid your problems.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.698
- Bye! See ya!
- I know, I know.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.671
You're disappointed in me.

16:47.740 --> 16:52.268
No, Daniel, I am so past disappointed.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.875
Fabia.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.248
Why is Fabia here today?

17:04.323 --> 17:07.588
I thought I had my meeting
for my cosmetics layout tomorrow.

17:07.659 --> 17:11.685
Well, I couldn't wait to congratulate
you on your upcoming nuptials.

17:11.763 --> 17:15.632
<i>Grazie. I had them done for the wedding.</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:18.363
Here's a picture of my boyfriend.

17:18.436 --> 17:22.874
Dimitri is the largest
shipping magnate in world!

17:23.976 --> 17:26.569
I love him!

17:26.645 --> 17:29.739
I need to marry him before
his bambinos cut me out of will.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.908
A love story for the ages.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.645
You must come to the ceremony.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.177
I wouldn't be able to get married
without my "something old."

17:37.256 --> 17:41.192
With the veins in your legs,
you already have your "something blue."

17:41.260 --> 17:44.696
I'm just sick I can't be there.
I'm also getting married on the 16th

17:44.763 --> 17:46.390
to, um... Bradford Meade.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.260
Big fish.

17:50.335 --> 17:54.567
It's too bad you won't be able to get
married at St. Patrick's Day Cathedral.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.540
So this is how we're going to play it?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.200
Oh, poor Wilhelmina.

17:58.277 --> 18:01.337
I suppose you're going to
have to change your wedding date.

18:01.413 --> 18:05.747
- Or do a quickie in Las Vegas.
- Wilhelmina Slater does not do Vegas.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.015
Now, I want my St. Patrick's
and I want my Elton John!

18:09.088 --> 18:12.080
There must be something
you want in exchange for the 16th.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.087
- I don't know...
- Anything.

18:19.131 --> 18:21.031
I want that girl.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.101
[Betty] He's going to hate it, Dad.
What do I do?

18:28.173 --> 18:29.538
<i>[Ignacio] Add cilantro.</i>

18:29.608 --> 18:33.100
I don't think I got cilantro.
Can I just add extra cheese?

18:33.178 --> 18:36.614
You didn't buy chili powder
and you used ketchup, so why not?

18:36.682 --> 18:40.049
Dad, this has to turn out great.
It's my first date with Henry.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.815
I remember the first time
your mother made me dinner.

18:42.888 --> 18:46.585
It tasted like shoe leather,
but I didn't care, because she made it.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.219
How do you make shoe leather?
Because I think that might be better.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.924
You have nothing to prove.
He already loves you.

18:55.334 --> 18:59.236
Dad, I miss you.
When are you coming home?

18:59.304 --> 19:01.704
I'll be home before you know it, Betty.

19:01.773 --> 19:02.967
Be strong.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.375
And remember the most important thing...

19:07.146 --> 19:10.138
...there are take-out menus
on top of the fridge.

19:10.215 --> 19:13.343
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.351
<i>Te quiero.</i>

19:26.198 --> 19:27.859
You're early!

19:31.770 --> 19:35.001
Charlie? What are you doing here?

19:35.073 --> 19:38.372
I called Henry at the office,
the receptionist said he'd be here.

19:39.211 --> 19:43.511
Yeah. I'm just making him dinner.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.413
Oh, really?

19:45.484 --> 19:48.180
Well, I have something in the oven, too.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.118
I'm pregnant.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.558
- You're pregnant?
- I leave for Tucson tomorrow.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.961
I thought he should know
as soon as possible.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.024
And ruining your date?
A nice little bonus.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.298
Pink Gerber daisies for my lady.

20:12.311 --> 20:15.303
- What are you doing here?
- Can we step outside and talk?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.916
You should talk to her.

20:43.141 --> 20:46.770
[Hilda] Oh, Hilda, you are so hot.
You know I am.

20:46.845 --> 20:50.212
[Justin] Mom! I'm Tony! I'm Tony!

20:50.282 --> 20:54.150
Sweetie, I know you want the part,
but you can't shriek it into existence.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.210
No, that was Mr. Weaver on the phone.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.724
Joey Colano woke up totally
covered in hives! Isn't that great?

20:59.791 --> 21:00.849
That poor kid.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.520
He had an allergic reaction
to the walnuts he ate.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.120
Well, if he's allergic,
why did he eat them?

21:06.198 --> 21:09.690
It's not my fault
he wanted to trade sandwiches.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.430
I didn't put walnuts
in your chicken salad.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.631
Oh, I think I did.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.470
Rachael Ray says it adds
a little crunch.

21:17.542 --> 21:20.477
What is with the third degree?
Your son is Tony! Be happy!

21:25.417 --> 21:26.941
He wouldn't.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.655
Christina, I'm going out of my mind.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.282
He said he was gonna call,
he hasn't called.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.952
And Charlie's flight
leaves to Tucson tonight.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.794
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.364
- Well, I can't sleep.
- Betty.

21:44.436 --> 21:48.133
Because she's pregnant doesn't mean
he's getting back with the whore.

21:48.206 --> 21:51.403
Sorry, was that a bit harsh?
I'm just trying to be supportive.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.673
Oh, my God.
It's a text message from Henry.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.106
"Can we talk?"

21:56.181 --> 21:59.742
- It's good. Men never want to talk.
- OK. Wish me luck.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.687
Where did you come from?

22:10.862 --> 22:12.124
Nowhere.

22:12.197 --> 22:13.994
You weren't there a second ago.

22:14.066 --> 22:17.763
Yes, I was. How drunk are you?

22:20.505 --> 22:22.632
What is that? What is that?

22:22.708 --> 22:25.074
No! No, this is my special place!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.710
Oh, my God!

22:28.780 --> 22:31.180
It's Fey's love dungeon!

22:31.249 --> 22:32.773
It's real!

22:32.851 --> 22:34.910
And now my special place is ruined!

22:34.986 --> 22:38.422
Oh, please. Your special place
was ruined years ago.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.958
OK, you've seen it. Get out.

22:44.463 --> 22:45.691
Oh, no.

22:46.398 --> 22:49.060
Oh my God. It's jammed shut.
We're locked in.

22:49.134 --> 22:53.070
Oh, no, no, no, no! We can't be!
We're not locked in!

22:55.107 --> 22:57.371
- Help!
- Help!

22:57.442 --> 22:58.739
Help!

22:58.810 --> 23:00.744
Help!

23:01.446 --> 23:04.882
So, that's it? You're leaving Mom
after 38 years?

23:04.950 --> 23:07.680
Now, when she needs you more than ever?

23:07.753 --> 23:10.586
For what? So you can be alone?

23:10.655 --> 23:12.589
Actually, I don't intend to be alone.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.124
What are you talking about?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.660
I've been lucky
to find someone that loves me.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.992
I'd be a fool to let that pass me by.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.555
- Who is it?
- Hello, Daniel.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.797
Wilhelmina?

23:27.572 --> 23:28.732
Call me "Mommy."

23:34.479 --> 23:36.947
I don't know what else to do.

23:37.015 --> 23:39.006
It's my baby.

23:40.786 --> 23:44.222
Betty, I grew up without a father.
I can't do that to my child.

23:44.289 --> 23:47.850
- I have to go to Tucson with them.
- No, no, Henry, I get that.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.796
You know, I just...

23:54.032 --> 23:57.433
...thought that for one day,
we were finally...

23:59.938 --> 24:02.600
...and I was... I was happy.

24:04.876 --> 24:06.468
I was too.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.142
I guess that would've been
too easy, huh?

24:15.821 --> 24:20.281
So, when do you and Charlie leave?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.654
Tonight.

24:24.863 --> 24:27.696
Oh, so, I guess...

24:28.533 --> 24:30.125
I guess this is...

24:37.042 --> 24:39.237
I want you to have
a really wonderful life.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.472
You deserve it.

25:17.816 --> 25:21.479
And for this layout, Fabia had vision.

25:21.553 --> 25:24.215
All the models
should look like they're suffering

25:24.289 --> 25:26.883
from sickness of radiation,
like Chernobyl.

25:26.958 --> 25:31.486
But this time, it is my makeup
that makes them glow!

25:31.563 --> 25:34.054
That's just... brilliant.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.701
We'll have a storyboard
ready by next week.

25:39.104 --> 25:40.264
Come on, baby.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.867
Picchu made brown.

25:46.945 --> 25:49.379
<i>Marco, clean it up. Ciao.</i>

25:58.423 --> 26:00.015
Marc.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.558
I didn't get a chance to explain, but...

26:05.063 --> 26:07.964
- Are you smoking?
- Yes. She makes me.

26:08.033 --> 26:11.059
- And she makes me eat pasta.
- Well, you do look heavy.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.727
What's wrong with your eyes?

26:13.805 --> 26:16.968
Fabia doesn't believe
in testing her products on animals.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.806
But she does believe
in testing them on assistants.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.278
Disgraceful. What about the insurance?

26:22.347 --> 26:23.780
- Full dental.
- Good.

26:23.848 --> 26:25.611
- Yeah.
- [Fabia] Marco!

26:27.519 --> 26:28.918
Well.

26:29.854 --> 26:32.345
I hope June 16th was worth it.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.472
<i>[Dave Koz, featuring Vanessa Williams:
The Way We Were]</i>

27:10.929 --> 27:13.090
Marc!

27:36.521 --> 27:38.148
Mom! I've lost it!

27:38.223 --> 27:40.384
I go on in two hours and I can't snap!

27:40.458 --> 27:42.619
What kind of gang member can't snap?

27:42.694 --> 27:45.686
You're going to snap, all right.
Relax. Eat something.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.322
Look, I made you a pizza bagel.

27:47.399 --> 27:51.301
<i>Did Angela Lansbury eat a pizza bagel
before she opened in Sweeney Todd?</i>

27:51.369 --> 27:53.633
All I got was "pizza bagel."

27:53.705 --> 27:56.367
You know what, kid,
you're gonna do great tonight.

27:56.441 --> 28:00.172
- You'll be there, right?
- Of course, I wouldn't miss it.

28:00.245 --> 28:01.542
OK.

28:02.914 --> 28:05.246
Hey. Spit on your fingers.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.781
Dad, it's "Break a Leg"
not "Spit on your Fingers."

28:08.853 --> 28:10.252
No, no. It helps, watch.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.858
Attaboy.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.502
- Hey.
- Are you lost again?

28:33.578 --> 28:35.910
Your office is two whores down.

28:35.980 --> 28:40.417
- No, I just came to say goodbye.
- OK. See you tomorrow.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.579
No, you won't. I'm...
I'm actually gone.

28:43.655 --> 28:46.249
I just... I'm quitting.

28:46.324 --> 28:49.054
Oh... here, here's my pen.

28:49.861 --> 28:53.160
- What are you babbling about?
- There's nothing left here.

28:53.231 --> 28:56.325
I mean, Mom's going to be in jail
for who knows how long.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.393
Dad just told me
about him and Milawheina,

28:59.471 --> 29:02.702
they're probably gonna have
some devil child together.

29:03.608 --> 29:06.577
- OK, I'm lost.
- But the funny thing is...

29:08.146 --> 29:10.944
...I don't have anyone to turn to.

29:11.015 --> 29:13.176
I guess it's not very funny, is it?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.555
- Daniel, you're loaded.
- Oh, just admit it, you hate me!

29:17.622 --> 29:19.112
[Glass crashing]

29:21.192 --> 29:23.786
And now the Girl Scouts hate me.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.161
But the thing is, I don't hate you.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.697
You want to know a secret?

29:32.737 --> 29:35.763
When I thought you were dead,

29:35.840 --> 29:38.468
I used to go visit your grave
every Sunday.

29:38.543 --> 29:41.307
Sometimes I still want to...

29:43.982 --> 29:45.950
...because I still miss you.

29:50.688 --> 29:54.146
Daniel, seriously, what did you take,
and how many?

29:54.225 --> 29:57.661
It was, like... seven.

29:58.229 --> 30:01.665
I mean, I've taken, like, 12 before,

30:01.733 --> 30:04.600
just not with this much booze.

30:04.769 --> 30:08.261
Hey Alexis, I have
the art department on line one...

30:08.339 --> 30:11.775
- I hope he's not driving.
- I'm taking him to Pine Crest.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.141
I need a Towncar. Now!

30:14.212 --> 30:18.581
Paula Abdul's fragrance release party
is tonight. Cars are booked solid.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.710
Then run down to the valet
and get the keys to my dad's car.

30:21.786 --> 30:25.586
Wait, I have to go to Paula's party.
Now she's going to hate me too.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.289
You ask me, I think she trapped him.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.624
You know she poked a hole
in that condom.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.665
I'm not interested
in hearing the specifics right now.

30:34.732 --> 30:39.294
- So, you ready for a little nitrous?
- No thank you. I want to feel the pain.

30:39.370 --> 30:43.500
Oh, I hate this girl. What's her name
so I can hate her with a name?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.600
- Charlie.
- Charlie!

30:45.677 --> 30:47.770
Charlie? That's funny.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.009
Dr. Farkas has been dating
a Charlie for like two months now.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.643
Well, it can't be the same Charlie
because she's been with Henry.

30:54.719 --> 30:57.779
This one's a cute red-head.
She makes jewelry.

30:57.856 --> 31:02.088
She made all the girls in the office
this. I hate it, but Farkas was in.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.458
Oh, my God! This is Henry's Charlie!

31:04.529 --> 31:07.327
I took Dr. Farkas
to Charlie's birthday party!

31:08.099 --> 31:10.226
Oh, my God! I introduced them!

31:11.436 --> 31:14.030
So, she's been cheating?
Charlie's a cheater!

31:15.106 --> 31:18.166
You know what?
Forget I said anything.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.734
I just keep talking
when I shouldn't be talking.

31:20.812 --> 31:23.906
- A little of me goes a long way.
- Do you know what this means?

31:23.982 --> 31:27.008
- No.
- Maybe the baby isn't Henry's!

31:31.956 --> 31:35.517
So Henry, call me back.
I really need to talk to you.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.288
Leaving a message on his cell?

31:37.362 --> 31:41.059
You're telling the man you love
his girlfriend's baby might not be his.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.362
Would Reese Witherspoon
leave a message?

31:43.434 --> 31:45.629
- Reese Witherspoon?
- Or Drew Barrymore?

31:45.703 --> 31:48.228
No, I don't think those women
are calling Henry.

31:48.306 --> 31:52.504
They're halfway to the airport to stop
that plane and declare their love!

31:54.012 --> 31:57.140
Maybe I do escape to the movies
more often than I should, but

31:57.215 --> 31:59.513
- this is your movie, Betty!
- It is?

31:59.584 --> 32:02.519
- Your chance for the happy ending!
- Yeah!

32:02.587 --> 32:06.387
Go home and put on some totally cute top
and run a brush through that hair,

32:06.457 --> 32:09.119
or maybe a hat,
and go and stop that plane!

32:09.193 --> 32:11.423
You're Drew Barrymore!

32:12.263 --> 32:15.824
I have my nephew's show tonight,
I don't know Henry's flight number.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.164
- What about security?
- Drew Barrymore!

32:25.443 --> 32:29.777
- Lorraine, I need graphics!
- Coming right up, Ms. Slater.

32:29.847 --> 32:33.908
What happened to you, Lorraine?
You suddenly seem more feminine.

32:33.985 --> 32:36.351
Fabia fired me. No explanation.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.788
She just put out a cigarette on my arm
and said "Get out!"

32:39.857 --> 32:44.055
So, I'm free and ready to come back
to work, if you'll have me.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.757
Well, you do already know
how I like my coffee.

32:47.832 --> 32:50.027
Not to mention your plot
to destroy Daniel

32:50.101 --> 32:55.004
and convince Bradford to divorce Claire
and marry you so you could take over.

32:55.073 --> 32:58.338
Yeah, that, too.
Welcome back, darling.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.809
So, what's on the agenda?

33:00.878 --> 33:05.338
A wedding to plan, June 16th is around
the corner, I have to get my shoes dyed.

33:05.416 --> 33:09.045
I changed the wedding. We aren't
getting married until November.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.520
What? But I thought you wanted...

33:12.890 --> 33:14.721
- Willie...
- What?

33:15.393 --> 33:18.692
Did you give Fabia back the 16th
in exchange for me?

33:18.763 --> 33:21.755
I just realized that my colors

33:21.833 --> 33:24.461
were better suited for a fall wedding.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.410
- You did not just hug me.
- Of course I didn't.

33:40.985 --> 33:45.285
And I never told anybody this,
but his name was Bill Cosby.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.286
You didn't.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.189
I have the audio tape to prove it.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.820
He has a very distinctive voice.

33:51.896 --> 33:56.356
You know, we've been talking
a lot about me.

33:57.668 --> 34:01.160
- And it's been fun...
- You want to know one of my secrets?

34:01.239 --> 34:03.639
You want to kiss me, don't you?

34:03.708 --> 34:06.700
Back in Scotland, I have a husband.

34:07.845 --> 34:11.645
- You just got 10% more interesting.
- He's an insurance auditor.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.378
- OK, five percent.
- Oh, believe me, it was less.

34:14.452 --> 34:17.478
The only time it got exciting
was when he'd come home drunk

34:17.554 --> 34:20.023
and he'd start
throwing the furniture around.

34:20.091 --> 34:23.150
So one morning, I woke up,

34:23.226 --> 34:27.254
I made Stuart his breakfast,
and off I went to the airport.

34:27.331 --> 34:31.062
To this day, he has no idea where I am.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.804
There is so much more to you
than that accent.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.340
- You can kiss me now if you want to.
- You are all about sex, aren't you?

34:40.411 --> 34:43.938
You do not have one secret
that's not about sex.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.347
I do have one.

34:47.418 --> 34:52.081
The woman whose room this is...
was a friend of my family's.

34:52.156 --> 34:56.114
What? You knew Fey Sommers
before you got this job?

34:56.194 --> 34:58.185
It's how I got this job.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.423
My dad handled her money.

35:00.498 --> 35:05.936
And he asked her to hook me up after
my acting career... hit a bit of a snag

35:06.003 --> 35:11.464
<i>and voila, the birth of lifetime
receptionist Amanda Tanen.</i>

35:11.542 --> 35:13.635
We should toast to secrets.

35:17.381 --> 35:18.905
Empty.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.317
Up we go...

35:29.861 --> 35:31.260
Hello.

35:35.833 --> 35:39.200
Hey, how you doing? I'm looking
for something for my kid.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.398
He's in a school play.
I don't know, like a card or something.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.135
He's always wanted
those teeth whitening strips.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.473
We're all out. You should go.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.403
<i>Oye, chico, what are you talking about?</i>

35:59.924 --> 36:01.983
Don't move!

36:10.902 --> 36:13.564
Ooh, ooh! Try today's date.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.129
Why would Fey Sommers
use today's date?

36:16.207 --> 36:17.435
You tell me!

36:17.508 --> 36:20.807
We've tried her birthday,
we've tried her address...

36:21.646 --> 36:22.806
Her measurements.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.111
- I don't know them.
- I do. Her real ones.

36:30.321 --> 36:31.788
- [Both gasp]
- Ooh!

36:31.856 --> 36:34.120
What's in there?
I want money and jewelry!

36:34.192 --> 36:37.753
- Looks like her diary.
- Reading? What else is there?

36:37.828 --> 36:40.262
Just a lot of photos.
Look, who's the fat baby?

36:41.566 --> 36:43.261
Wait, that's me.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.604
Why would Fey have
pictures of me in her safe?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.704
- What?
- It's a birth certificate.

36:52.743 --> 36:54.870
It says Fey Sommers was your mother.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.091
[Labored breathing]

37:20.271 --> 37:21.431
Excuse me, sir...

37:22.306 --> 37:25.537
Excuse me!
We have a situation back here!

37:25.610 --> 37:30.104
This woman is a diabetic and she
is going into hypoglycemic shock!

37:30.715 --> 37:34.549
[Man] All right, everyone stay seated.
I'm coming back with a med kit.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.919
OK, stay still...

37:40.992 --> 37:43.756
- Let go of me!
- Get his gun! Get the damn gun!

37:43.828 --> 37:47.730
You're going to have to stop struggling,
sir, because this is happening.

37:51.736 --> 37:54.637
OK, we're almost at the hospital,
Daniel. Stay with me.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.376
You know, I never wanted us
to end up like this.

38:00.578 --> 38:03.741
I mean, you're my kid brother.

38:03.814 --> 38:07.409
I don't know how all this
got so screwed up but I...

38:07.485 --> 38:10.181
...I really want us to be there
for each other again.

38:12.723 --> 38:15.886
Wow. You're driving really fast.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.896
- Yeah, what's the matter with these...
- You should probably slow down.

38:21.365 --> 38:23.390
I can't.

38:25.836 --> 38:28.327
- Oh, God! The brakes! Son of a bitch!
- What...

38:28.406 --> 38:31.170
He cut the brakes on Bradford's car!

38:34.178 --> 38:36.646

40:51.515 --> 40:55.611
Yes, we can. We will.

There was a gun. He got shot.
