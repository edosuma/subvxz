we never cross the

[birds cawing]

23:56.573 --> 24:00.991
[patrons chattering quietly]

24:01.025 --> 24:01.854
- [Jake] Mother?

24:03.718 --> 24:05.409
- Wanna drink something?

24:05.444 --> 24:06.272
A beer?

24:07.204 --> 24:08.688
Labatt?
- Sure.

24:10.518 --> 24:13.659
[Mother speaking French]

24:13.693 --> 24:14.901
Thanks.

24:14.936 --> 24:16.593
Hey, listen, I wanna-
- Wait for the beer.

24:17.801 --> 24:19.458
Correc'?

24:19.492 --> 24:22.564
[muffled rock music]

24:27.776 --> 24:32.781
The way I see it, the
question before us is, why?

24:33.506 --> 24:34.921
Why was the boy
stopped at the border?

24:36.336 --> 24:38.822
And the logical answer is,
someone knew he was crossing.

24:38.856 --> 24:40.237
Now, who knew that?

24:40.271 --> 24:41.997
Your people knew that.

24:42.032 --> 24:43.240
- My guys wouldn't talk.

24:45.656 --> 24:47.727
- Well, somebody
had to tip this off.

24:49.142 --> 24:51.144
It's an unpatrolled stretch
of our southern border.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.457
Can't be caught
without informant.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.941
- But, Mother, my associates,

24:54.976 --> 24:57.357
and you've met them,
they're Armenian.

24:57.392 --> 24:59.808
They would rather die
than talk to the police.

25:01.361 --> 25:02.777
- Look, Jake, I like you.

25:03.778 --> 25:04.986
You've been a good customer,

25:05.020 --> 25:07.160
buying a little
batch here, there,

25:07.195 --> 25:08.541
but this larger plan now

25:08.576 --> 25:11.061
seems to be beyond
your capabilities.

25:11.095 --> 25:12.959
These boys, they
worked well for us

25:12.994 --> 25:14.374
until we delivered to you.

25:14.409 --> 25:15.997
Now we have a bust.

25:16.031 --> 25:17.895
And who knows how many
they're pressuring.

25:17.930 --> 25:19.448
- Okay, I agree.

25:19.483 --> 25:20.691
Things haven't necessarily
gone smoothy so far, but-

25:20.726 --> 25:22.348
- Smooth?

25:22.382 --> 25:23.591
Are you stupid or what?

25:23.625 --> 25:25.178
[Mother speaking French]

25:25.213 --> 25:27.836
- Maybe for now you
keep your head down,

25:27.871 --> 25:29.113
focus on what you know.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.427
- Couriers aren't the only way.

25:33.877 --> 25:37.018
My guys run trucks through
the entire United States.

25:37.052 --> 25:38.606
So, you take the
product to a warehouse,

25:38.640 --> 25:40.849
you package it as vitamins,

25:40.884 --> 25:44.232
then they come in their
trucks and pick it up.

25:44.266 --> 25:47.131
- Well, tell me,
what's gonna happen

25:47.166 --> 25:48.547
when they get to customs?

25:50.134 --> 25:50.963
- NAFTA.

25:52.136 --> 25:53.448
You take it to a
Foreign Trade Zone

25:53.482 --> 25:55.346
where the police
can't do inspections,

25:55.381 --> 25:57.383
only customs agents can,

25:57.417 --> 25:58.626
and they're not gonna open

25:58.660 --> 26:00.282
every single bottle
of sealed vitamins.

26:03.044 --> 26:07.048
- Before we trust, as your
President Reagan used to say,

26:07.082 --> 26:08.359
we must verify.

26:09.671 --> 26:11.949
We must learn why it did happen.

26:11.984 --> 26:13.917
[Guy speaking French]

26:13.951 --> 26:15.712
- Oui.

26:15.746 --> 26:17.679
We're gonna talk to
our guy at customs.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.547
- It's right there.

26:45.189 --> 26:46.639
- [Doctor] You sure?

26:46.674 --> 26:47.502
- Yeah.

26:54.267 --> 26:58.651
[gasps]
[slow music]

27:07.453 --> 27:11.112
- [sobbing] Oh, god.

27:11.146 --> 27:13.079
- We won't have
toxicology for a few days,

27:13.114 --> 27:15.841
but a paramedic in the alley
said it was an overdose.

27:16.738 --> 27:17.601
Oxycodone.

27:19.707 --> 27:20.915
- What?

27:20.949 --> 27:21.847
- [Detective Carson] He
was foaming at the mouth

27:21.881 --> 27:23.365
when they arrived.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.402
They tried Narcan to revive
him, but it was too late.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.372
Were you aware of any
issues with your son?

27:30.407 --> 27:31.442
- [Claire] Like what?

27:31.477 --> 27:32.547
- Drug issues.
- No.

27:34.998 --> 27:36.689
Absolutely not.

27:36.724 --> 27:38.346
- Any idea where
he would get pills?

27:38.380 --> 27:41.625
- Uh, my, my sister had
an accident a while ago.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.799
- Sue.

27:42.833 --> 27:43.385
- And there were some
painkillers lying-

27:43.420 --> 27:44.628
- Sue.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.836
- There were some
painkillers around.

27:45.871 --> 27:47.389
- Those pills have
been gone for months.

27:47.424 --> 27:49.357
- [Detective Carson] Sometimes
children steal these pills.

27:49.391 --> 27:51.842
- David wasn't doing
drugs, I would've known.

27:51.877 --> 27:53.050
- [Detective Carson]
I understand.

27:53.085 --> 27:54.811
Is it a single parent household?

27:54.845 --> 27:56.295
- What are you getting at?

27:56.329 --> 27:57.537
Just come out and say it to me.

27:57.572 --> 28:00.195
Otherwise what are
you gonna do about it?

28:00.230 --> 28:02.508
- We're gonna continue
to monitor the situation.

28:02.542 --> 28:03.992
- And?

28:04.027 --> 28:05.166
- [Detective Carson] And
see if anything comes up.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.408
- What does that mean?
- I, I, Claire-

28:06.443 --> 28:07.340
- No, what does that...

28:07.375 --> 28:08.514
What the fuck does that mean,

28:08.548 --> 28:09.722
see if anything comes up?

28:09.757 --> 28:11.344
Are you out there looking?

28:11.379 --> 28:13.519
I'm sorry, I love you so much.

28:14.762 --> 28:16.004
- [Detective Carson]
Right now the department

28:16.039 --> 28:18.075
is treating this as
an accidental death.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.836
- Accidental?

28:19.870 --> 28:21.596
You don't even
know what happened.

28:22.942 --> 28:25.393
- Ms. Reimann, we have
40 overdoses this week,

28:25.427 --> 28:27.119
here in Detroit alone.

28:27.153 --> 28:28.914
That's more than homicides.

28:28.948 --> 28:31.226
This isn't anything
against your son.

28:31.261 --> 28:32.400
It's a terrible drug.

28:33.573 --> 28:34.402
I'm sorry.

28:36.231 --> 28:38.613
We have his belongings for you.

28:38.647 --> 28:40.339
We just need you
to sign for them.

28:41.236 --> 28:44.308
[slow intense music]

29:23.934 --> 29:25.971
- [Reeva] So, this is the
replicate study I brought in,

29:26.005 --> 29:28.490
and it shows exactly
the same result.

29:28.525 --> 29:30.009
- Biological explanation?

29:30.044 --> 29:33.116
- We'd need a mass spec to see
how the liver's metabolizing,

29:33.150 --> 29:35.394
not to mention many
more basic experiments.

29:35.428 --> 29:37.361
- We're talking six
months of work at least.

29:37.396 --> 29:40.364
- Mm, that's not gonna
fly with Northlight.

29:41.296 --> 29:42.781
[sighs]

29:42.815 --> 29:45.300
Something in the drug is
crossing the blood-brain barrier

29:45.335 --> 29:46.992
and hitting the reward centers,

29:47.026 --> 29:51.548
but Klaralon is supposed
to reduce dependence,

29:51.582 --> 29:53.274
not increase it threefold.

29:54.551 --> 29:56.346
How could they not
have caught this?

29:57.761 --> 29:59.314
Well, write up your findings.

29:59.349 --> 30:01.800
We should get this over
to Northlight right away.

30:14.191 --> 30:17.574
- [Guy] How did the border
agents know to stop the boy?

30:17.608 --> 30:18.437
- You tell me.

30:19.645 --> 30:21.958
- You're supposed to be
our ears of the patrols.

30:24.236 --> 30:26.272
- I heard rumors.
- What?

30:29.724 --> 30:32.002
- Someone's talking,
in your house.

30:32.037 --> 30:33.452
[Guy scoffs]

30:33.486 --> 30:35.730
- That's ridiculous.
[Fournier speaking French]

30:35.764 --> 30:36.765
- It's true.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.594
There's a list.

30:38.975 --> 30:40.597
- What list?

30:40.631 --> 30:41.943
- And who are you?
- Never mind that.

30:41.978 --> 30:43.117
Answer the fucking question.
- Hey, whoa.

30:43.151 --> 30:44.843
Whoa, relax.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.741
You know a guy named Davison?

30:46.775 --> 30:50.227
The cop that was disgraced,
facing corruption charges?

30:50.262 --> 30:51.435
- [Guy] Yeah.

30:51.470 --> 30:52.920
- When Internal
Affairs got onto him,

30:52.954 --> 30:55.612
they heard about a list he kept
at the major crimes bureau,

30:55.646 --> 30:58.270
Over 200 names on it.

30:58.304 --> 31:02.274
Every informant from every
crew he ever worked with.

31:02.308 --> 31:05.864
I bet that on that
list is your informant.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.349
- Where's the list now?

31:08.383 --> 31:09.626
- [Fournier] I heard
he's trying to sell it.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.558
- Where?

31:10.592 --> 31:11.973
- I'm just a custom inspector.

31:12.008 --> 31:13.699
Can't you find him?

31:13.733 --> 31:15.114
- All right, get out.

31:15.149 --> 31:16.426
[Fournier speaking French]

31:16.460 --> 31:19.532
Get the fuck out!
[groaning]

31:21.051 --> 31:23.674
See, I told you, he's garbage.

31:23.709 --> 31:25.884
- We gotta find that list.

31:28.714 --> 31:31.096
[slow music]

32:07.408 --> 32:10.066
[sighs heavily]

32:11.550 --> 32:13.724
[sobbing]

32:16.210 --> 32:19.040
[phone vibrating]

32:50.899 --> 32:52.729
- [Meg Voicemail] Hi,
this is Dr. Meg Holmes.

32:52.763 --> 32:53.902
Please leave a message.

32:55.249 --> 32:57.596
- So, in recognition
of that great bounty,

32:57.630 --> 33:00.392
our foundation is pleased
to announce tonight

33:00.426 --> 33:04.465
a five-year $30
million commitment

33:04.499 --> 33:07.778
to the building of this
new contemporary art wing.

33:07.813 --> 33:10.229
[applauding]

33:12.956 --> 33:14.509
- Once FDA approves,

33:14.544 --> 33:18.513
we will bring Klaralon
to market in six months.

33:18.548 --> 33:19.894
And in the spirit of gift giving

33:19.928 --> 33:21.482
you demonstrated tonight,

33:21.516 --> 33:24.002
here on page three are
the sales projections.

33:26.073 --> 33:27.660
- Wow, those are, uh...

33:27.695 --> 33:28.868
Wow.

33:28.903 --> 33:31.871
- Physician response
is tremendous.

33:31.906 --> 33:33.528
- When our dad built Northlight,

33:33.563 --> 33:35.082
his dream was not
just to make money,

33:35.116 --> 33:37.670
it was to make the
world a better place.

33:37.705 --> 33:40.570
- An addiction-free painkiller
was always his goal,

33:40.604 --> 33:41.502
and you found it.

33:42.710 --> 33:45.126
- You've done our
family proud, Meg.

33:45.161 --> 33:48.026
- It was only possible through
your support, gentlemen.

33:49.165 --> 33:51.477
I'm pleased we were
able to deliver for you.

33:51.512 --> 33:53.479
[phone vibrating]

33:53.514 --> 33:54.446
- Will you excuse me?

33:54.480 --> 33:55.343
- Of course.
- Sure.

33:57.794 --> 33:59.106
- Hello?

33:59.140 --> 34:00.831
- [Bill On Phone]
Meg? It's Bill.

34:00.866 --> 34:01.832
We've got an issue.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.943
- [Meg] How long has
he been a resource?

34:08.977 --> 34:10.496
- Eight years.

34:10.531 --> 34:12.671
He's always stamped whatever
we put in front of him.

34:12.705 --> 34:14.086
- So where'd this come from?

34:16.088 --> 34:18.332
- A mistake, apparently.

34:19.505 --> 34:21.059
As you can see, he
ran the study twice

34:21.093 --> 34:22.232
with the same results.

34:22.267 --> 34:24.269
I've been saying we take
it under advisement.

34:24.303 --> 34:26.685
- But now Tyrone's
recommending we share his data

34:26.719 --> 34:28.307
with a panel of scientists

34:28.342 --> 34:31.069
and present it at a
conference for further study?

34:31.103 --> 34:32.794
I thought you were
on top of this.

34:34.451 --> 34:35.935
- How do you wanna handle it?

34:43.357 --> 34:44.358
[rock music]

34:44.392 --> 34:45.876
- Davison.

34:45.911 --> 34:47.533
Apparently he's in
a motel downtown

34:47.568 --> 34:49.777
trying to make a
sale of the list.

34:49.811 --> 34:51.503
$200k.

34:51.537 --> 34:54.402
- So, what's the move?
- I arranged a meet.

34:54.437 --> 34:56.094
You guys go down there.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.096
Motel Arlequin.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.442
Room 206.

35:00.408 --> 35:03.653
If the list is good, you buy it.

35:03.687 --> 35:05.551
- For 200k?
- I front the money.

35:06.725 --> 35:08.278
We can turn it around
to the other crews,

35:08.313 --> 35:09.383
make a profit, too.

35:10.867 --> 35:12.834
- Or you can use the list to
eliminate your competition.

35:13.939 --> 35:15.872
- See, I told you he's smart.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.943
You could learn
something from this man.

35:17.977 --> 35:21.843
[Mother speaking French]

35:21.878 --> 35:23.535
- I'll be by your
hotel tomorrow.

35:26.434 --> 35:27.849
- Google's made
it more difficult

35:27.884 --> 35:30.024
for some phones with
two-factor authentication.

35:30.058 --> 35:31.267
- Can you unlock it?

35:31.301 --> 35:32.958
- This will
brute-force some codes

35:32.992 --> 35:34.753
by overriding the lockout.

35:34.787 --> 35:35.961
It might take a minute.

35:36.893 --> 35:39.896
[keyboard clacking]

35:41.208 --> 35:42.381
Okay, let's see.

35:46.868 --> 35:48.456
Bingo.

35:48.491 --> 35:50.286
You're lucky, it was
a four-digit code.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.701
3959.

35:54.669 --> 35:55.498
- Thanks, Ted.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.244
- [Bill] It's not that
we don't appreciate it.

36:17.278 --> 36:19.901
Northlight just has a lot
of studies to look at.

36:19.936 --> 36:22.697
- Was there something
wrong with our work?

36:22.732 --> 36:25.079
- No, no, your
work is excellent.

36:25.113 --> 36:27.633
And that's why they
authorized me to award you

36:27.668 --> 36:31.913
a grant of $780,000
for continued funding

36:31.948 --> 36:33.156
of your other research.

36:37.436 --> 36:38.265
- Wow.

36:39.887 --> 36:42.303
This is very generous
of you, Bill.

36:42.338 --> 36:44.340
It would mean a lot to the lab.

36:44.374 --> 36:47.826
- If you'll just sign
these modification papers

36:47.860 --> 36:50.449
we can process the grant
as part of the new set up.

36:50.484 --> 36:52.865
Should be able to get
your funds within a week.

36:57.145 --> 36:57.974
- All right.

36:58.906 --> 37:02.012
Um, let me look over these

37:02.047 --> 37:04.705
and I'll get back to you.

37:04.739 --> 37:06.258
- It's pretty standard stuff.

37:06.293 --> 37:08.260
Just wanna get you up and
running quickly, you know?

37:08.295 --> 37:09.157
Get this thing moving.

37:09.192 --> 37:10.366
- Yeah, yeah.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.438
Um, I'll have them
read by the morning.

37:13.472 --> 37:14.646
Fair enough?

37:14.680 --> 37:16.095
- Yeah, yeah.

37:16.130 --> 37:17.752
You bet.

37:17.787 --> 37:19.340
- Wow, this is amazing.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.618
Thank you, Bill.
- Thank you.

37:21.653 --> 37:22.895
- Good to see you, Bill.

37:22.930 --> 37:24.621
- Tomorrow.
- Oh yeah, for sure.

37:41.466 --> 37:43.433
- What's this guy's deal?

37:43.468 --> 37:44.296
- Never mind that.

37:44.331 --> 37:45.263
He's a piece of shit.

37:46.954 --> 37:47.782
- All right.

37:50.509 --> 37:51.545
Looks like being an informant

37:51.579 --> 37:56.377
doesn't pay what it used to.

37:56.412 --> 37:57.275
206?
- 206.

38:07.561 --> 38:10.184
[guns cocking]

38:13.636 --> 38:14.464
- Fuck.

38:23.922 --> 38:26.511
How much you wanna bet the
list was on the fucking laptop?

38:26.545 --> 38:28.306
Let's get the hell out of here.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.871
[Guy inhaling sharply]

38:41.905 --> 38:43.804
- Who took the list?

38:43.838 --> 38:45.978
- How the fuck
would we know that?

38:46.013 --> 38:46.841
- Fuck!

38:48.395 --> 38:49.844
Okay.

38:49.879 --> 38:50.776
What do we do now?

38:51.639 --> 38:52.537
- Nothing.

38:52.571 --> 38:53.572
The deal goes down as planned.

38:53.607 --> 38:54.953
- Nah, no way.

38:54.987 --> 38:56.437
It's too risky.

38:56.472 --> 38:58.094
- The Armenians can be trusted.

38:59.509 --> 39:00.786
- I don't know.

39:00.821 --> 39:02.270
I think we should
just wait and see if-

39:02.305 --> 39:03.479
- They want 3 million.

39:06.309 --> 39:07.966
- Street value?
- No.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.106
Raw fentanyl, at your price.

39:12.729 --> 39:15.111
- Still, the timing feels wrong.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.906
- Look, I'll guarantee the cash.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.390
Right to the switch point.

39:18.425 --> 39:20.288
And you have no
distribution exposure.

39:20.323 --> 39:22.187
And even if there is a snitch,

39:22.221 --> 39:25.017
as long as it's kept
between Mother, you, and me,

39:25.052 --> 39:27.399
no one will find out about it.

39:27.434 --> 39:28.987
- Fuck, I'll think it over.

39:29.021 --> 39:30.954
- You'd better hurry,
'cause we can buy elsewhere.

39:30.989 --> 39:31.886
- Ah, fuck.

39:31.921 --> 39:33.440
Just drive the fucking car.

39:33.474 --> 39:35.890
[slow music]

39:44.692 --> 39:47.868
- After you hired me, I
read the police report.

39:47.902 --> 39:49.835
It said that your son died

39:49.870 --> 39:54.771
from an overdose of
oxycodone 80-milligram pills,

39:54.806 --> 39:56.670
ingested and inhaled.

39:56.704 --> 39:57.498
- Yeah, I know.

39:57.533 --> 39:58.430
I read the report.

39:58.465 --> 39:59.845
- Well, here's the thing.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.778
There's no smoke in his lungs.

40:03.470 --> 40:04.609
- No smoke?

40:04.643 --> 40:06.265
- And from the pink
condition of his lungs,

40:06.300 --> 40:08.992
I'd say he didn't smoke ever.

40:09.027 --> 40:12.858
Further, there's severe bruising
on the back of his head.

40:19.865 --> 40:21.211
- [Claire] What are you saying?

40:21.246 --> 40:23.041
- Either your son took 10

40:23.075 --> 40:25.526
80-milligram oxys
on his first try

40:25.561 --> 40:27.252
this night on his way home-
- Or what?

40:27.286 --> 40:28.253
Someone hit him over the head

40:28.287 --> 40:29.427
and forced him to swallow them?

40:29.461 --> 40:30.289
Is that...

40:32.084 --> 40:33.500
How could the cops miss that?

40:33.534 --> 40:35.571
- Cops miss a lot of things.

40:35.605 --> 40:37.365
I know, I used to be one.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.197
- How did he die?

40:42.647 --> 40:45.477
- As I said, the indication is-

40:45.512 --> 40:48.411
- No, I mean, how?

40:49.964 --> 40:51.207
What was it like for him?

40:53.312 --> 40:55.487
- Do you really wanna know?

40:57.627 --> 40:59.042
- I need to know.

41:15.196 --> 41:16.508
- And with that, I bid you,

41:16.543 --> 41:20.995
go forth and bring
me a breakthrough.

41:21.030 --> 41:25.862
Bonne chance! [claps]
[students chattering]

41:25.897 --> 41:27.450
Hey, Geoff.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.176
You have fun the other night?

41:29.210 --> 41:30.039
- I did.

41:31.661 --> 41:36.045
- Now, honestly, did
I overcook the fish?

41:36.079 --> 41:38.116
- Honestly, I thought
it was chicken.

41:38.150 --> 41:40.325
[laughing]

41:40.359 --> 41:41.878
- What's up?

41:41.913 --> 41:44.363
- Well, I heard about this
situation with Northlight,

41:44.398 --> 41:45.675
the pharmaceutical study.

41:47.435 --> 41:49.852
One of the trustees know
somebody on their board.

41:50.991 --> 41:52.337
- Yeah?

41:52.371 --> 41:53.614
- Well, as you know,

41:53.649 --> 41:55.789
I'm not a big fan of
these arrangements.

41:55.823 --> 41:58.446
- Well, we've never
had a problem before.

41:58.481 --> 42:00.138
- Well, no, but I have.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.175
The situation is not
unique to you, Ty.

42:03.210 --> 42:05.039
I got a lot of teachers
that pay their rent

42:05.074 --> 42:06.489
with these corporate studies,

42:06.524 --> 42:09.043
which means I'm often
asked to look the other way

42:09.078 --> 42:10.769
on the inherent conflicts.

42:10.804 --> 42:12.012
- Added to which,

42:12.046 --> 42:14.566
Northlight is one of the
school's major donors.

42:14.601 --> 42:17.293
- That's not fair
and you know it.

42:17.327 --> 42:19.019
- I'm not trying to make
waves for you, Geoff.

42:19.053 --> 42:20.434
- Well, then, you
can see why we don't

42:20.468 --> 42:22.919
wanna make a federal
case out of this thing.

42:24.127 --> 42:25.819
I understand they want
you to sign something.

42:25.853 --> 42:27.027
- [Tyrone] [chuckles]
Have you read it?

42:27.061 --> 42:28.511
- I've read enough of it.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.099
- Well, then you will
know that they want me

42:30.133 --> 42:31.514
to sign a statement saying

42:31.549 --> 42:34.206
we made significant errors,

42:34.241 --> 42:35.829
that we cannot be relied upon,

42:35.863 --> 42:39.246
which is as bizarre a
request as I have ever seen.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.523
- Who cares if it's bizarre?

42:40.558 --> 42:42.007
It's a confidential agreement.

42:42.042 --> 42:43.388
- We have been a good source
for them for eight years,

42:43.422 --> 42:45.942
and the one time, the one time,

42:45.977 --> 42:47.772
that my results
contradict theirs,

42:47.806 --> 42:50.188
all of a sudden they
want an expanded

42:50.222 --> 42:51.914
confidentiality agreement?

42:53.294 --> 42:57.402
Geoff, you know
what this is about.

42:57.436 --> 43:00.612
- No, we're not jumping to
any conclusions here, okay?

43:00.647 --> 43:02.545
Our job is to be educators,

43:02.580 --> 43:05.859
not to grapple with big pharma.

43:05.893 --> 43:09.690
Let's just think about
signing what it is they want

43:09.725 --> 43:11.934
and we can be done with this.

43:11.968 --> 43:15.075
[slow intense music]

43:24.049 --> 43:24.912
- [Simon Voicemail]
Hey, it's Simon.

43:24.947 --> 43:26.845
Please leave a message.

43:47.383 --> 43:50.179
[engine whirring]

43:50.213 --> 43:53.700
[upbeat electronic music]

44:47.650 --> 44:48.962
- Hey.

44:48.996 --> 44:49.790
Hey.

44:49.825 --> 44:51.136
- Hey, what do you want?

44:51.171 --> 44:53.932
- I'm uh, I'm, I'm
David's mother.

44:53.967 --> 44:55.934
David Reimann.
- Yeah, I know.

44:55.969 --> 44:57.833
- Then why did you
walk away from me?

44:58.972 --> 45:00.387
- I don't know.

45:00.421 --> 45:02.044
- On his phone there was a
bunch of missed calls from you.

45:02.078 --> 45:03.286
What did you want?

45:03.321 --> 45:04.909
- We were friends.
- No.

45:04.943 --> 45:06.186
You weren't my son's friend.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.739
If you were, I would've
known your name.

45:07.774 --> 45:10.811
- Simon, are you okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

45:10.846 --> 45:12.433
- Why don't you leave him alone?

45:12.468 --> 45:13.676
- Come with me.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.643
- Look, we hung out
a couple of times,

45:15.678 --> 45:16.886
it wasn't a big deal.

45:16.921 --> 45:18.232
So, then, what did
you want with him?

45:18.267 --> 45:20.510
- I mean, I wasn't
his friend exactly.

45:20.545 --> 45:21.960
Um, Cedric was.

45:23.410 --> 45:25.274
- Cedric Beauville?

45:25.308 --> 45:26.931
From the hockey camp?

45:26.965 --> 45:28.139
You went to Montrose?

45:28.173 --> 45:29.105
- Yeah.

45:29.140 --> 45:30.728
Look, all I know is
that Cedric needed him

45:30.762 --> 45:32.108
and he told me to find him.

45:33.385 --> 45:34.214
- Wait.

45:35.077 --> 45:36.216
Where can I find Cedric?

45:36.250 --> 45:37.873
- You didn't hear?
- What?

45:37.907 --> 45:39.495
- It was on the news.
- What?

45:39.529 --> 45:41.704
- Look, I really
don't know anything.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.843
I only ran for them once.

45:42.878 --> 45:44.258
It wasn't a big deal.

45:45.915 --> 45:46.778
- You ran drugs?

45:47.779 --> 45:48.573
Come with me.

45:49.608 --> 45:50.748
- All right, all right.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.542
Look, look, it was
Derrick up in Montreal.

45:52.577 --> 45:53.785
He runs a lot of oxy there.

45:53.820 --> 45:56.167
Just please don't tell
him I said anything.

46:06.833 --> 46:09.283
[slow music]

46:10.388 --> 46:11.285
- [Stan On Phone]
Nobody's heard anything

46:11.320 --> 46:12.597
from the Armenians on the wires.

46:12.631 --> 46:14.392
If you don't get them
to buy from Mother soon,

46:14.426 --> 46:15.634
it's all gonna fall apart.

46:15.669 --> 46:17.809
I really think you
gotta get back here.

46:17.844 --> 46:19.742
- [Jake] Okay, I'm
on my way back.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.813
- [Stan On Phone] Jake,
we're running out of time.

46:21.848 --> 46:22.952
- Yeah, I said I'm on my way.

46:22.987 --> 46:25.196
I'll be there when I'm there.

46:33.549 --> 46:36.207
[phone ringing]

46:39.348 --> 46:40.142
- Oui.

46:40.176 --> 46:41.143
- Just spoke to my guys.

46:41.177 --> 46:41.971
They're good to go.

46:42.006 --> 46:43.145
Are we on?

46:43.179 --> 46:44.077
- Yeah, we're on.

46:45.423 --> 46:46.976
But one thing.

46:47.011 --> 46:48.046
You come alone.

46:49.392 --> 46:51.153
- What, and carry
everything out on my back?

46:51.187 --> 46:51.981
No.

46:52.016 --> 46:53.638
My guys bring in trucks.

46:53.672 --> 46:54.639
- [Guy] After you pay.

46:54.673 --> 46:55.847
- No way.

46:55.882 --> 46:57.159
- All right, then forget it.

46:59.678 --> 47:01.853
- [Jake] Okay, I bring in
a million as a deposit,

47:01.888 --> 47:03.751
but I wanna see the goods.

47:03.786 --> 47:06.478
After that, my guys come
in and they bring the rest.

47:06.513 --> 47:07.514
That's it.

47:07.548 --> 47:08.377
Yes or no?

47:09.585 --> 47:10.482
- [Guy] Yes.

47:10.517 --> 47:11.518
- Good.

47:11.552 --> 47:13.071
But I'm coming with big money,

47:13.106 --> 47:14.486
so I wanna see your
operation first.

47:14.521 --> 47:15.453
I need to know that
you can actually

47:15.487 --> 47:16.730
step up and handle this.

47:18.421 --> 47:19.802
- [Guy] I'll talk to Mother.

47:23.357 --> 47:25.428
- [Armen] Look, it's just bad.

47:25.463 --> 47:27.327
Now the feds are
tracking prescriptions,

47:27.361 --> 47:29.191
the smart move is walk away.

47:29.225 --> 47:31.089
- Yeah, that's why
we're walking away

47:31.124 --> 47:34.541
from the pill mill business
and getting into fentanyl.

47:34.575 --> 47:35.749
Mother's ready.

47:35.783 --> 47:36.784
- Too much heat.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.583
For all we know, we're under
surveillance right now.

47:42.618 --> 47:43.895
- Look, if we pussy out now-

47:43.930 --> 47:45.897
- Pussy out?

47:45.932 --> 47:48.417
Not a very sophisticated
way to look at it.

47:49.590 --> 47:51.730
Maybe we should listen
to Armen and walk.

47:54.181 --> 47:57.322
On the other hand,
the demand is high,

47:57.357 --> 48:00.049
and the junkies are
fiends for this.

48:00.084 --> 48:01.982
Maybe it's worth the risk.

48:02.017 --> 48:03.673
- If we go a million a piece

48:03.708 --> 48:05.986
we can turn 3 million into 30.

48:07.815 --> 48:09.576
- I don't have a million.

48:09.610 --> 48:11.785
- Fuckin' Maserati
Minas over there does.

48:11.819 --> 48:12.613
He's rich.

48:12.648 --> 48:14.132
Borrow some from him.

48:14.167 --> 48:15.962
- What a brave
fellow you are, Jake.

48:20.207 --> 48:21.588
We'll let you know tomorrow.

48:29.216 --> 48:31.909
- RCMP say they've
arrested Cedric Beauville.

48:31.943 --> 48:34.187
The 18-year-old was
crossing this snowy,

48:34.221 --> 48:38.053
unpatrolled stretch of the
border wearing camouflage.

48:38.087 --> 48:39.778
Authorities say he
set off the alarm

48:39.813 --> 48:41.539
at the Saint-Armand crossing

48:41.573 --> 48:44.611
where he was caught with
over half a million dollars

48:44.645 --> 48:45.992
of fentanyl pills.

48:46.026 --> 48:48.166
The pills are a
public health menace

48:48.201 --> 48:51.273
and are popular among
younger drug users.

48:51.307 --> 48:52.757
Beauville is being held

48:52.791 --> 48:55.449
at the federal detention
center in Montreal, Quebec. -

48:56.864 --> 48:58.901
So, you weren't contracted
to work with Klaralon.

48:58.936 --> 48:59.729
How'd you get it?

49:00.903 --> 49:01.800
- I don't follow.

49:01.835 --> 49:03.250
- The drug Klaralon.

49:03.285 --> 49:04.251
It's not on market yet.

49:04.286 --> 49:05.183
How'd you get it?

49:05.218 --> 49:06.564
- From the chemistry department.

49:06.598 --> 49:08.359
I asked them to make me some.

49:08.393 --> 49:09.739
- Based on the
patent literature,

49:09.774 --> 49:13.398
you had our chemistry department
synthesize it for you?

49:13.433 --> 49:14.986
- Yeah, we do it
all the time, Geoff.

49:15.021 --> 49:15.987
You know that.

49:16.022 --> 49:17.471
- And now based on your results,

49:17.506 --> 49:19.887
you want Northlight to pull
their billion dollar drug,

49:19.922 --> 49:22.097
a drug that's just
about to hit the market,

49:22.131 --> 49:24.651
off the market for
some further testing.

49:24.685 --> 49:27.309
- The results show
co-valent bonds-

49:27.343 --> 49:28.966
- Chris, can you talk to
him about the liability?

49:29.000 --> 49:30.450
- Yeah.

49:30.484 --> 49:32.314
The original agreement that
you signed eight years ago

49:32.348 --> 49:35.282
already contained a
confidentiality provision.

49:35.317 --> 49:37.043
You still can't share
your findings with anyone.

49:37.077 --> 49:38.009
- Well, that's insane.

49:38.044 --> 49:39.873
This is a public health issue.

49:39.907 --> 49:42.393
- Dammit, Tyrone, we
don't know that at all!

49:42.427 --> 49:43.670
And just so you know,

49:43.704 --> 49:45.154
Northlight spoke to a
number of your clients

49:45.189 --> 49:47.018
and they also had strange
results from your labs.

49:47.053 --> 49:48.295
- What clients?
- And when pressed further,

49:48.330 --> 49:50.056
many of them had
significant questions

49:50.090 --> 49:51.747
about your testing methodology.

49:51.781 --> 49:53.266
- If people are accusing
me of being unprofessional,

49:53.300 --> 49:55.130
I think I have a right to know.

49:55.164 --> 49:57.477
- If you leak Northlight's data,

49:57.511 --> 49:59.789
the university can be liable.

49:59.824 --> 50:01.688
- And we're talking
about Northlight,

50:01.722 --> 50:02.689
a multibillion-dollar
manufacturer

50:02.723 --> 50:04.932
from three generations

50:04.967 --> 50:07.073
of one of the richest
families on the planet,

50:07.107 --> 50:08.591
a family that, I think
we can all agree,

50:08.626 --> 50:09.765
has done a lot of
good in the world.

50:09.799 --> 50:11.284
- Oh, have they?

50:11.318 --> 50:14.528
If we knew about oxycodone
then and could've spoken,

50:14.563 --> 50:15.943
look at all the harm
we could've prevented,

50:15.978 --> 50:16.944
the lives we could've saved.

50:16.979 --> 50:18.325
- If you take it upon yourself

50:18.360 --> 50:21.121
to publish Northlight's
proprietary data-

50:21.156 --> 50:24.055
- Dr. Brower, you
could even be liable

50:24.090 --> 50:25.298
for criminal charges.

50:27.990 --> 50:30.372
- [laughs] A crime?

50:30.406 --> 50:32.650
For telling the truth?

50:32.684 --> 50:34.893
I don't believe it.
- Believe it!

50:37.068 --> 50:39.277
Tyrone, you know I respect you,

50:39.312 --> 50:40.554
but I need you to promise

50:40.589 --> 50:43.040
that you won't share
this data with anyone.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.284
Tenure's not forever, you know?

50:47.803 --> 50:49.046
Neither is your reputation.

50:50.219 --> 50:51.945
- What is that supposed to mean?

50:51.979 --> 50:54.741
- You bring shame
upon this university

50:54.775 --> 50:56.915
and it can cost you
a hell of a lot more

50:56.950 --> 51:01.127
than your teaching job.
[slow suspenseful music]

51:50.210 --> 51:52.488
[phone ringing]

51:52.523 --> 51:53.696
- [Policeman] You have reached

51:53.731 --> 51:55.388
the Gratiot Police
Department after hours.

51:55.422 --> 51:58.770
If you have the extension of
the party you'd like to reach-

52:25.797 --> 52:27.385
- This is always the way.

52:27.420 --> 52:30.630
First it was tobacco,
then it was oxy.

52:30.664 --> 52:32.356
Now it's your turn.

52:32.390 --> 52:34.081
Dangerous territory.

52:34.116 --> 52:36.118
- If this carries over
to the human trials,

52:36.153 --> 52:38.810
not only is this painkiller
not non-addictive,

52:38.845 --> 52:43.056
it's three times more
addictive than oxy.

52:43.090 --> 52:46.266
- They're in the final stages
of their FDA submission.

52:46.301 --> 52:47.854
If your report became public,

52:47.888 --> 52:50.408
they'd have to withdraw
their request for approval,

52:50.443 --> 52:51.961
all for some mice

52:51.996 --> 52:53.963
that are outside the scope
of the agreed protocol?

52:55.241 --> 52:56.380
- And nobody cares.

53:00.970 --> 53:03.007
I could always
take it somewhere.

53:04.353 --> 53:06.183
- [Dr. Ishiyama] Where?

53:06.217 --> 53:07.667
- [Tyrone] How about the FDA?

53:08.875 --> 53:10.773
- [Dr. Ishiyama] Tyrone,
this is not something

53:10.808 --> 53:12.706
you wanna bring upon
yourself lightly.

53:13.673 --> 53:14.950
You've gotta have a plan.

53:15.916 --> 53:17.159
- A plan?

53:17.194 --> 53:18.609
For telling the truth?

53:18.643 --> 53:19.817
- Don't be naive.

53:20.714 --> 53:22.199
Sometimes that's not enough.

53:24.097 --> 53:26.203
And we've both done a
lot of contract work

53:27.273 --> 53:29.309
is this really the
worst you've ever seen?

53:31.484 --> 53:32.312
- The worst.

53:33.796 --> 53:35.246
- Then be careful.

54:11.006 --> 54:12.525
- Yeah, to a T.

54:13.974 --> 54:14.803
Yes, sir.

54:15.631 --> 54:16.460
Thank you.

54:17.875 --> 54:19.221
I can't believe I'm doing this.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.429
- But you'll approve it?

54:20.464 --> 54:22.983
- If you guys get the
Armenians on board,

54:23.018 --> 54:25.503
I can authorize a
mil in flash money.

54:25.538 --> 54:26.953
- [Jake] Yes.

54:26.987 --> 54:28.644
- But the whole op is gonna
have to be supervised.

54:28.679 --> 54:30.715
- We won't have advance
notice to get cameras in.

54:30.750 --> 54:32.717
- You can use surveillance
vans, can't you?

54:32.752 --> 54:33.546
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

54:33.580 --> 54:34.409
- [Jake] Yes.

54:34.443 --> 54:35.962
- All right.

54:35.996 --> 54:37.515
Stan, you're willing to go
out in the field with him?

54:37.550 --> 54:38.378
- Yes.

54:39.276 --> 54:41.312
- Okay, sign right there.

54:41.347 --> 54:44.660
Anything happens to that
money, it's your asses.

54:44.695 --> 54:45.558
[phone vibrating]

54:45.592 --> 54:46.766
- Nothing's gonna
happen to the money.

54:48.215 --> 54:50.045
- Excuse me one second.
- I guaran-fucking-tee it.

54:50.079 --> 54:51.011
- Hello?

54:51.046 --> 54:52.116
- [Woman On Phone]
Hi, is this Mr. Kelly?

54:52.150 --> 54:53.324
- Yeah, this is him.

54:53.359 --> 54:54.498
- [Woman On Phone]
Yes, I'm calling

54:54.532 --> 54:55.775
from Gables Treatment
to let you know

54:55.809 --> 54:57.052
that your sister has
checked herself out.

54:57.086 --> 54:58.295
- What?

54:58.329 --> 55:02.644
[intense music]
[tires screeching]

55:02.678 --> 55:05.025
Mom, how much did she get?

55:05.060 --> 55:06.268
- [Anne] Well, it looks
like all of it, Jake.

55:06.303 --> 55:07.683
Are you gonna go
to the pawn shops?

55:07.718 --> 55:09.892
- Pawn shops were
open hours ago.

55:09.927 --> 55:11.100
I'm passing the buy spots now.

55:11.135 --> 55:12.585
I'll call you when I get her.

55:23.906 --> 55:24.735
- Hey, Jake, man.

55:25.632 --> 55:27.116
What up, dog?

55:27.151 --> 55:30.534
Yo, yo, you all right?
[groaning]

55:32.674 --> 55:34.331
- Where is she?
[Frankie groans]

55:46.412 --> 55:47.896
Is that it?
- Yeah.

55:52.659 --> 55:54.489
- How many people are
in there with her?

55:54.523 --> 55:56.698
- I don't know, man,
I don't go in there.

55:56.732 --> 55:57.630
Come on.

55:57.664 --> 55:59.148
- Get the fuck out of here.

56:26.003 --> 56:31.008
[banging]
[mellow electronic music]

56:59.554 --> 57:00.382
Fuck.

57:03.489 --> 57:04.628
- Get your hands off me.
- It's okay.

57:04.662 --> 57:05.663
It's okay, come on.

57:05.698 --> 57:06.906
Come on.
- Hey.

57:06.940 --> 57:07.976
- Come on, Emmie.
- Hey.

57:08.010 --> 57:09.356
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

57:09.391 --> 57:10.979
- Get your hands off me.

57:11.013 --> 57:12.601
- Hey.

57:12.636 --> 57:13.913
- Sit the fuck down.

57:16.743 --> 57:20.402
It's okay.
- Hey, get your hands off me.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.784
Get your fucking
hands off me, Jake!

57:22.818 --> 57:24.682
- It's okay.
- No!

57:24.717 --> 57:25.614
No!
- It's okay.

57:25.649 --> 57:27.444
- Get your fucking hands off me!

57:27.478 --> 57:30.964
Get your hands off me
now, you're fucking...

57:31.931 --> 57:36.832
Help!
[slow intense music]

58:32.198 --> 58:34.614
[indistinct]

58:58.258 --> 58:59.536
- Dr. Brower.

58:59.570 --> 59:01.572
I'm Ben Walker, from the FDA.

59:01.607 --> 59:02.435
May I sit?

59:04.299 --> 59:06.439
- Do you have some ID?
- Yes.

59:09.649 --> 59:10.892
I'm glad you reached out.

59:12.445 --> 59:14.723
Well, I read your report.

59:15.724 --> 59:17.036
Who else knows about this?

59:18.278 --> 59:20.418
- Northlight, obviously.

59:20.453 --> 59:22.248
The university.

59:22.282 --> 59:24.388
They're not happy with me.

59:24.422 --> 59:26.390
- There's some things I
need to ask you about.

59:26.424 --> 59:27.909
- [Tyrone] Go ahead.

59:27.943 --> 59:29.117
- I understand
there was an issue

59:29.151 --> 59:30.428
of sexual harassment
some years back?

59:30.463 --> 59:31.637
With a student?
- Oh, Jesus.

59:31.671 --> 59:33.224
You really have been
checking up on me.

59:34.743 --> 59:37.746
[sighs] I was cleared.

59:37.781 --> 59:38.609
- [Ben] But what was it?

59:38.644 --> 59:40.059
- It was nothing.

59:40.093 --> 59:41.888
[stammers] A remark I
made one night in the lab

59:41.923 --> 59:43.476
and it got blown
out of proportion.

59:43.510 --> 59:45.098
- The tenure committee
didn't think so.

59:45.133 --> 59:46.893
You were censured.
- I was cleared!

59:48.861 --> 59:50.483
- You've gotta prepare yourself.

59:52.519 --> 59:54.763
- Will the FDA take action?

59:54.798 --> 59:56.282
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

59:56.316 --> 59:59.250
Science at this level is often
a matter of interpretation.

59:59.285 --> 1:00:02.875
- This is not
interpretation, this is data.

1:00:02.909 --> 1:00:04.048
- What I'm saying is,

1:00:04.083 --> 1:00:05.878
until now you've mainly
been a validator,

1:00:05.912 --> 1:00:08.639
taking the money and letting
the studies play themselves.

1:00:08.674 --> 1:00:10.814
- Well, that's pretty cynical.

1:00:10.848 --> 1:00:13.023
I like to think I did a
little more than that.

1:00:13.057 --> 1:00:14.369
- Through your own
research, maybe,

1:00:14.403 --> 1:00:15.612
but as far as your
outside contracts-

1:00:15.646 --> 1:00:16.785
- Who the hell are you?

1:00:16.820 --> 1:00:19.788
Some bureaucrat with
a plastic badge.

1:00:19.823 --> 1:00:23.067
You're here because
I pressed the button,

1:00:23.102 --> 1:00:25.829
and you wanna ridicule me.

1:00:25.863 --> 1:00:27.244
- They're gonna come after you.

1:00:27.278 --> 1:00:28.728
They'll say you're a drunk.

1:00:28.763 --> 1:00:29.902
- I'm not a drunk.

1:00:29.936 --> 1:00:32.180
- And a bad scientist,
undistinguished,

1:00:32.214 --> 1:00:33.560
whatever they can think of.

1:00:33.595 --> 1:00:35.010
But what you're doing now

1:00:35.045 --> 1:00:37.254
may be the most important
thing you ever do.

1:00:41.258 --> 1:00:44.054
[camera clicking]

1:00:50.716 --> 1:00:52.303
- Come on, out.
- Get off me.

1:00:52.338 --> 1:00:53.891
Don't fucking touch me.

1:00:53.926 --> 1:00:55.513
Oh, you're taking
me back to Mom now?

1:00:55.548 --> 1:00:56.687
You're gonna fucking tell on me?

1:00:56.722 --> 1:00:58.206
Is that it?

1:00:58.240 --> 1:00:59.656
- Do you have any idea
what you're doing to Mom?

1:01:00.587 --> 1:01:01.485
[indistinct]

1:01:01.519 --> 1:01:02.348
- Mommy.

1:01:03.418 --> 1:01:04.764
Look what he did to me.
- In the house.

1:01:04.799 --> 1:01:05.696
- Jake, handcuffs?
- Jake, these really hurt,

1:01:05.731 --> 1:01:06.870
I'm telling you.

1:01:06.904 --> 1:01:08.009
Take them off.
- Mom, don't start.

1:01:08.043 --> 1:01:09.182
- It's our house.
- Listen.

1:01:10.908 --> 1:01:11.944
You gonna relax?
- Yes.

1:01:11.978 --> 1:01:13.428
- Can you behave?
- Yes.

1:01:14.912 --> 1:01:16.742
- Take it off, please.

1:01:22.333 --> 1:01:23.162
Thank you.

1:01:24.370 --> 1:01:25.923
[spits]
[groaning]

1:01:25.958 --> 1:01:27.166
Fuck you!

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:28.823
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fuck you!

1:13:36.308 --> 1:13:38.724
[door slams]

1:13:40.519 --> 1:13:43.280
[mixer clanking]

1:13:52.842 --> 1:13:53.843
- This is the mixer.

1:13:54.982 --> 1:13:57.225
It blends the powder
base with the fentanyl.

1:13:59.469 --> 1:14:01.091
This one takes the
fentanyl powder

1:14:01.126 --> 1:14:02.610
and presses it into pills.

1:14:03.749 --> 1:14:05.164
This is the counter machine.

1:14:07.373 --> 1:14:09.445
Pills go in, pills go out

1:14:10.618 --> 1:14:12.862
and drop directly into
your vitamin bottle.

1:14:12.896 --> 1:14:15.589
Street value is $30 per pill.

1:14:15.623 --> 1:14:16.659
- That's impressive.

1:14:19.213 --> 1:14:22.043
[Mother coughing]

1:14:23.528 --> 1:14:24.908
- What's your situation now?

1:14:26.082 --> 1:14:27.739
- My guys will be
here in three days.

1:14:27.773 --> 1:14:28.602
- Good.

1:14:29.465 --> 1:14:30.466
So, now you've seen.

1:14:31.950 --> 1:14:32.985
We're gonna be ready.

1:14:34.849 --> 1:14:37.611
Oh, and also, uh,

1:14:37.645 --> 1:14:40.165
we took care of
that other problem.

1:14:40.199 --> 1:14:41.615
- What problem?

1:14:41.649 --> 1:14:43.099
- Cedric.

1:14:43.133 --> 1:14:44.031
The courier.

1:14:44.963 --> 1:14:47.068
- Yeah?
- Yep.

1:14:47.103 --> 1:14:48.380
- That son of a bitch is gone.

1:14:48.414 --> 1:14:49.864
- Yeah. [laughs]

1:14:49.899 --> 1:14:54.490
We also found out who the
informant was after all.

1:14:55.732 --> 1:14:56.733
- [Guy] Oh, you did?

1:14:58.701 --> 1:15:00.496
- [Mother] Oui.

1:15:00.530 --> 1:15:01.358
- Good, good.

1:15:02.532 --> 1:15:03.499
And who was it?

1:15:06.053 --> 1:15:09.677
- Well, [chuckles]
you knew all along,

1:15:09.712 --> 1:15:11.299
it was you, Tabernac!

1:15:11.334 --> 1:15:13.129
[gunshot]

1:15:13.163 --> 1:15:13.957
[gun cocking]

1:15:13.992 --> 1:15:17.064
[shouting in French]

1:15:18.928 --> 1:15:22.518
He killed Davison in the hotel
room before you got there.

1:15:22.552 --> 1:15:25.382
He stole the laptop because
he knew his name was on it.

1:15:27.212 --> 1:15:28.938
He was an RCMP snitch.

1:15:30.111 --> 1:15:30.940
- How, how-

1:15:30.974 --> 1:15:32.182
[speaks in French]

1:15:32.217 --> 1:15:33.045
Here.

1:15:34.115 --> 1:15:35.013
We went to his house.

1:15:35.047 --> 1:15:36.462
We find the laptop there.

1:15:37.325 --> 1:15:38.879
But your name wasn't on it.

1:15:40.674 --> 1:15:42.572
That was good news
for you, my friend.

1:15:44.125 --> 1:15:46.058
But now you know the stakes.

1:15:47.473 --> 1:15:51.167
Anything happens, we can touch
you anywhere in the world,

1:15:51.201 --> 1:15:52.513
no matter who you are.

1:15:54.619 --> 1:15:57.173
So, are we still on?

1:15:59.106 --> 1:16:01.764
- Yeah.
[intense music]

1:16:14.984 --> 1:16:17.158
[banging]

1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:48.983
[doorknob jiggling]

1:16:49.950 --> 1:16:52.884
[glass shattering]

1:16:53.885 --> 1:16:56.577
[lock clicking]

1:17:35.927 --> 1:17:38.515
[door opening]

1:17:40.172 --> 1:17:42.830
[Claire groans]

1:17:44.107 --> 1:17:44.936
- Fuck.

1:17:47.524 --> 1:17:48.767
- [Claire] Sit down, now!

1:17:51.805 --> 1:17:52.702
- Please don't shoot me.

1:17:52.737 --> 1:17:54.117
- Did you have my son killed?

1:17:54.152 --> 1:17:57.293
- Please don't shoot.
- Did you have my son killed?

1:17:57.327 --> 1:17:58.984
- Who?
- David.

1:17:59.019 --> 1:18:00.814
David Reimann.

1:18:05.163 --> 1:18:07.510
- I told them he
didn't know anything.

1:18:07.544 --> 1:18:09.339
He just came along on one run.

1:18:09.374 --> 1:18:11.445
- You had my son
run drugs for you?

1:18:11.479 --> 1:18:12.308
- No.

1:18:13.827 --> 1:18:16.381
It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

1:18:16.415 --> 1:18:17.727
Huh?

1:18:17.762 --> 1:18:19.211
- We met at camp.

1:18:19.246 --> 1:18:21.213
I asked him to come along
on a trip with some friends.

1:18:21.248 --> 1:18:23.388
I hid the pills in David's bag.

1:18:23.422 --> 1:18:25.424
He never even knew
what he was carrying.

1:18:35.607 --> 1:18:38.437
- So, then, why
did they kill him?

1:18:39.438 --> 1:18:40.785
Why not you?

1:18:40.819 --> 1:18:41.993
- I don't know!

1:18:42.027 --> 1:18:43.339
I didn't know they were
gonna kill anybody.

1:18:43.373 --> 1:18:45.651
- You didn't know who
was gonna kill anybody?

1:18:47.377 --> 1:18:48.206
- Mother.

1:18:49.138 --> 1:18:50.691
Word is after Cedric got busted,

1:18:50.726 --> 1:18:52.003
he got completely paranoid

1:18:52.037 --> 1:18:53.418
and started cutting loose ends.

1:18:53.452 --> 1:18:54.833
I'm probably next.

1:18:58.526 --> 1:19:00.805
Please don't shoot me.

1:19:00.839 --> 1:19:01.702
Please.

1:19:03.428 --> 1:19:04.256
Please.

1:19:18.546 --> 1:19:19.927
[water running]

1:19:19.962 --> 1:19:22.067
[grunts]

1:19:31.214 --> 1:19:34.045
[phone vibrating]

1:19:36.841 --> 1:19:39.050
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

1:19:39.084 --> 1:19:40.845
- Did they kill the kid?

1:19:40.879 --> 1:19:42.225
Cedric.

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:43.433
- I'm afraid so.

1:19:43.468 --> 1:19:44.710
They found him
foaming at the mouth

1:19:44.745 --> 1:19:45.642
at the foot of his cell.

1:19:45.677 --> 1:19:46.816
Somebody got to his food.

1:19:48.197 --> 1:19:50.233
There's another
kid dead here, too.

1:19:50.268 --> 1:19:51.856
- What kid?

1:19:51.890 --> 1:19:53.478
- Simon Gilcrest.

1:19:53.512 --> 1:19:55.721
OD'd on oxy like
the Reimann boy.

1:19:55.756 --> 1:19:56.757
We don't know how
they're linked yet.

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:58.517
He was probably another courier.

1:19:58.552 --> 1:20:01.003
We think they all
went to the same camp.

1:20:01.037 --> 1:20:01.900
- [Jake] Guy's dead, too.

1:20:01.935 --> 1:20:02.832
- [Stan On Phone] What?

1:20:02.867 --> 1:20:03.902
How?
- Mother.

1:20:04.869 --> 1:20:06.008
Just now.

1:20:06.042 --> 1:20:08.493
I was fucking standing
right next to him.

1:20:08.527 --> 1:20:10.667
- [Stan On Phone] I think
we reconsider the meet.

1:20:11.841 --> 1:20:12.738
- No.

1:20:12.773 --> 1:20:13.878
- Jake, remember what happened

1:20:13.912 --> 1:20:15.396
when Benny Alvarez
messed with these guys?

1:20:15.431 --> 1:20:16.777
They're still pulling pieces
of his body out of the river.

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:18.399
- Do you think I don't
fucking know that?

1:20:18.434 --> 1:20:19.849
Huh?

1:20:19.884 --> 1:20:21.023
Do you have any idea
what I just went through?

1:20:21.057 --> 1:20:22.334
- They're doing
multiple homicides.

1:20:22.369 --> 1:20:24.440
You cannot walk
into that buy alone.

1:20:24.474 --> 1:20:26.235
- Mother said that-
- Fuck Mother!

1:20:26.269 --> 1:20:27.546
Is he worth your life?

1:20:32.931 --> 1:20:33.829
- We can't quit.

1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:37.453
We can't stop.

1:20:39.765 --> 1:20:41.008
- At least let me have

1:20:41.043 --> 1:20:42.596
some advance warning
to cover you, okay?

1:20:42.630 --> 1:20:43.597
Even 40 minutes.

1:20:45.702 --> 1:20:46.496
- Okay, yeah.

1:20:47.981 --> 1:20:49.499
I'll text you the meet
location as soon as I get it,

1:20:49.534 --> 1:20:51.191
and you coordinate with RCMP.

1:20:51.225 --> 1:20:53.400
But they can't fuck this up.

1:20:53.434 --> 1:20:55.160
- [Stan On Phone] I'm on it.

1:20:55.195 --> 1:20:57.645
- Okay, and be flexible.

1:20:57.680 --> 1:20:59.544
The meet location could
change at any minute.

1:21:03.341 --> 1:21:05.308
- [Madira] I went
by the school today.

1:21:05.343 --> 1:21:07.345
Why didn't you tell
me what was happening?

1:21:09.209 --> 1:21:12.488
[Tyrone sighs heavily]

1:21:16.733 --> 1:21:17.873
- I'm sorry, I...

1:21:19.184 --> 1:21:21.152
I tried to take care of it, and,

1:21:23.257 --> 1:21:24.569
it got so much bigger.

1:21:27.883 --> 1:21:30.920
I guess I overestimated myself.

1:21:32.094 --> 1:21:33.854
- But why didn't you
share it with me?

1:21:34.959 --> 1:21:35.925
Do you think I
couldn't handle it?

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:36.926
- No, no.

1:21:36.961 --> 1:21:39.204
[stammers]

1:21:40.481 --> 1:21:42.207
I didn't wanna worry you.

1:21:42.242 --> 1:21:43.760
I wanted to protect you.

1:21:43.795 --> 1:21:44.900
- Oh, come on.

1:21:46.453 --> 1:21:47.799
We're in this together.

1:21:49.076 --> 1:21:51.182
And you have a responsibility.

1:21:51.216 --> 1:21:53.287
- Yeah, to our family.

1:21:53.322 --> 1:21:55.324
- To something larger than that.

1:21:58.914 --> 1:22:02.745
- If they let me go now,
under these circumstances,

1:22:02.779 --> 1:22:05.748
I just can't turn around
and find another job.

1:22:08.854 --> 1:22:10.408
I really don't know what to do.

1:22:11.685 --> 1:22:13.514
- We will manage.

1:22:13.549 --> 1:22:14.515
We will.

1:22:16.172 --> 1:22:17.104
We always do.

1:22:18.450 --> 1:22:19.279
- Yeah?

1:22:28.184 --> 1:22:29.013
I'm sorry.

1:22:43.682 --> 1:22:44.511
Um, Bill.

1:22:45.512 --> 1:22:48.170
It's, uh, Tyrone.

1:22:50.068 --> 1:22:52.312
I've thought about
your proposal.

1:22:52.346 --> 1:22:53.899
Um.

1:22:53.934 --> 1:22:55.867
Uh, let's come to
an arrangement.

1:23:02.322 --> 1:23:04.980
[paper ripping]

1:23:17.233 --> 1:23:19.925
[phone ringing]

1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:28.969
[Claire sighs]

1:23:30.419 --> 1:23:31.868
- Hello?

1:23:31.903 --> 1:23:34.423
- [Susan On Phone] Claire,
I've been trying to call you.

1:23:34.457 --> 1:23:36.080
Your car's not in the driveway.

1:23:36.114 --> 1:23:36.977
Where are you?

1:23:38.082 --> 1:23:38.944
- I'm traveling.

1:23:38.979 --> 1:23:39.773
- Traveling?

1:23:39.807 --> 1:23:40.705
Where?

1:23:40.739 --> 1:23:41.913
- [Claire On Phone] Listen, Sue,

1:23:41.947 --> 1:23:43.777
I can't really talk
right now, okay?

1:23:43.811 --> 1:23:45.503
I-
- What are you doing, Claire?

1:23:47.988 --> 1:23:49.783
- Sue.
- Claire.

1:23:50.784 --> 1:23:53.131
I know that this is hell.

1:23:53.166 --> 1:23:54.063
- You know,

1:23:55.754 --> 1:23:57.135
the doctor said it took

1:23:59.724 --> 1:24:02.451
four minutes for his
heart to give out.

1:24:05.419 --> 1:24:07.559
It took him four minutes
to stop breathing.

1:24:09.044 --> 1:24:13.151
Four minutes his heart was
constricting in his chest,

1:24:13.186 --> 1:24:15.947
like someone was strangling
him until he died.

1:24:19.330 --> 1:24:22.229
[sobbing]
- Claire.

1:24:22.264 --> 1:24:23.575
- [Claire On Phone] I'm sorry.

1:24:23.610 --> 1:24:24.473
- Claire.

1:24:24.507 --> 1:24:25.336
Claire.

1:24:26.164 --> 1:24:28.787
[Claire gasps]

1:24:50.154 --> 1:24:52.846
[water running]

1:25:06.170 --> 1:25:07.412
- Dr. Brower.
- Yes.

1:25:07.447 --> 1:25:08.620
- How are you?

1:25:08.655 --> 1:25:09.759
I'm Sarah, Dr.
Simons' assistant.

1:25:09.794 --> 1:25:10.726
- Hi.
- Follow me, please.

1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:12.072
- Thank you.

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.591
- Did you find everything okay?

1:25:13.625 --> 1:25:14.488
- Yeah, thanks.

1:25:17.871 --> 1:25:20.218
It's uh, quite a place, huh?

1:25:20.253 --> 1:25:21.150
- [Sarah] Yeah.

1:25:21.185 --> 1:25:22.600
I'm lucky to call it my office.

1:25:34.059 --> 1:25:34.888
- [Bill] Tyrone.

1:25:35.854 --> 1:25:36.683
- [Tyrone] Bill.

1:25:38.202 --> 1:25:39.893
- These are the
execution copies.

1:25:41.066 --> 1:25:44.208
And here is the grant
check for your lab.

1:25:47.901 --> 1:25:49.144
- It's made out to me.

1:25:50.593 --> 1:25:51.974
- I'm sure you can
endorse it over,

1:25:52.008 --> 1:25:53.734
if that's what you want.

1:25:53.769 --> 1:25:54.597
It's up to you.

1:25:57.462 --> 1:25:58.601
- Dr. Brower.

1:26:01.570 --> 1:26:03.537
I am Meg Holmes.

1:26:03.572 --> 1:26:04.435
- Dr. Holmes.

1:26:05.988 --> 1:26:07.023
Yeah.

1:26:07.058 --> 1:26:08.024
The CEO.

1:26:09.025 --> 1:26:11.200
I uh, must be important.

1:26:11.235 --> 1:26:12.546
- Very important to us.

1:26:12.581 --> 1:26:13.685
And thanks so much,

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:15.549
so much, for being here.

1:26:16.930 --> 1:26:19.104
I'm glad we were able
to come to an agreement

1:26:19.139 --> 1:26:20.313
to support your work.

1:26:23.143 --> 1:26:24.386
- Support my work.

1:26:26.008 --> 1:26:27.458
That's surprising.

1:26:27.492 --> 1:26:30.599
I didn't know you'd taken
much interest in it before.

1:26:30.633 --> 1:26:33.188
- We only learned recently
how much good it can do.

1:26:37.675 --> 1:26:40.643
- Dr. Holmes, with respect,
may I ask you something?

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:44.613
Why ignore my data?

1:26:44.647 --> 1:26:48.410
You read the report, you,
you know what happens.

1:26:48.444 --> 1:26:50.032
Klaralon doesn't work.

1:26:53.932 --> 1:26:55.693
- Let's say it doesn't work.

1:26:56.659 --> 1:26:58.143
What then?

1:26:58.178 --> 1:26:59.697
- Then why make it?

1:26:59.731 --> 1:27:01.250
- Because it will work.

1:27:01.285 --> 1:27:03.321
It will, in time.

1:27:03.356 --> 1:27:07.463
- You're a scientist, you
can't sign your name to a lie.

1:27:07.498 --> 1:27:08.637
- It's not a lie.

1:27:08.671 --> 1:27:09.983
It's a step on the path.

1:27:11.156 --> 1:27:14.263
I am here operating
in the real world,

1:27:14.298 --> 1:27:17.577
and if Klaralon is even
1% better than oxycodone,

1:27:17.611 --> 1:27:19.993
then that's 1% that
can change the world.

1:27:21.166 --> 1:27:23.168
You will never change
demand or behavior.

1:27:24.549 --> 1:27:26.827
But you will fund continued
research through these products

1:27:26.862 --> 1:27:28.173
and take a step closer

1:27:28.208 --> 1:27:29.865
to the ultimate
breakthrough that will come.

1:27:29.899 --> 1:27:31.729
- That's not my world.

1:27:31.763 --> 1:27:33.248
That's a cause.

1:27:33.282 --> 1:27:35.215
I don't deal in causes.

1:27:35.250 --> 1:27:36.768
- But somebody has to.
- I deal in science.

1:27:36.803 --> 1:27:37.942
I deal in truth.

1:27:37.976 --> 1:27:40.185
- And what precisely
is that truth?

1:27:40.220 --> 1:27:41.773
You think you get to
make that decision,

1:27:41.808 --> 1:27:43.499
along with all the
collateral damage

1:27:43.534 --> 1:27:45.087
it might bring with it?

1:27:45.121 --> 1:27:47.848
What about the millions
in pain who need this drug

1:27:47.883 --> 1:27:50.437
to ease their suffering
and use it legitimately?

1:27:51.783 --> 1:27:54.096
Should they be denied
care because you say so?

1:27:55.787 --> 1:27:58.169
- You're holding up
one animal study,

1:27:58.203 --> 1:28:00.309
one highly questionable study,

1:28:00.344 --> 1:28:01.759
while even you yourself know

1:28:01.793 --> 1:28:06.557
that 65% of these animal studies
don't translate to humans.

1:28:06.591 --> 1:28:10.457
And for that you wanna destroy
a chance at real relief?

1:28:11.665 --> 1:28:13.771
If that's not a cause,
I don't know what is.

1:28:26.473 --> 1:28:27.440
- I can't do it.

1:28:31.996 --> 1:28:33.066
I won't do it.

1:28:54.329 --> 1:28:57.401
[muffled rock music]

1:29:00.127 --> 1:29:00.956
- Jake.

1:29:01.991 --> 1:29:03.061
No Labatt tonight?

1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:05.029
- No.

1:29:05.995 --> 1:29:07.411
Just whiskey.

1:29:07.445 --> 1:29:08.515
- Takes all kinds.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.312
- We all set for tomorrow?

1:29:13.417 --> 1:29:16.420
- Of course we
are, what we said.

1:29:16.454 --> 1:29:17.317
- Good.

1:29:18.801 --> 1:29:20.493
So, where's the meet?

1:29:20.527 --> 1:29:23.772
- We still work out
a safe place for you.

1:29:23.806 --> 1:29:25.877
I'll tell you tomorrow, Correc'?

1:29:28.017 --> 1:29:29.122
- And you'll be there?

1:29:30.572 --> 1:29:31.780
'Cause I'll be there.

1:29:33.229 --> 1:29:35.128
And I'm not handing
all of my fucking money

1:29:35.162 --> 1:29:37.026
to somebody I never met before.

1:29:38.614 --> 1:29:40.789
- What, you worry I set you up?

1:29:40.823 --> 1:29:41.617
Is that it?

1:29:43.239 --> 1:29:44.827
Or maybe you set me up.

1:29:47.692 --> 1:29:49.453
It's a crazy business we choose.

1:29:51.316 --> 1:29:52.145
- Crazy.

1:29:54.492 --> 1:29:57.150
- I guess we'll
find out tomorrow.

1:29:57.184 --> 1:29:59.152
[laughing] Of course
I'll be there.

1:30:01.430 --> 1:30:03.121
You wanna eat something?

1:30:03.156 --> 1:30:05.158
We make a good steak here.

1:30:05.192 --> 1:30:06.021
- No.

1:30:06.953 --> 1:30:07.712
I'm going home.

1:30:07.747 --> 1:30:08.610
I'm going to bed.

1:30:10.646 --> 1:30:11.475
Tomorrow.

1:30:50.548 --> 1:30:51.549
Excuse me, miss.

1:30:51.584 --> 1:30:52.654
Can I help you?

1:30:52.688 --> 1:30:53.482
- No, I'm fine.

1:30:53.517 --> 1:30:55.001
Thank you.

1:30:55.035 --> 1:30:55.829
Oh.

1:30:55.864 --> 1:30:57.072
What?

1:30:57.106 --> 1:30:58.901
- Ms. Reimann, whatever
you're looking for,

1:30:58.936 --> 1:31:00.316
you are not gonna
find it in there.

1:31:00.351 --> 1:31:01.835
- What? [groans]

1:31:01.870 --> 1:31:04.320
- I suggest that you go home.

1:31:06.115 --> 1:31:07.703
Go all the way home.

1:31:08.566 --> 1:31:10.913
- How do you know who I am?

1:31:10.948 --> 1:31:12.432
- It doesn't matter.

1:31:12.467 --> 1:31:15.262
All that matters is that no
one wants to see you dead.

1:31:15.297 --> 1:31:16.125
Go home.

1:31:18.611 --> 1:31:20.302
- Okay. [breathing heavily]

1:31:20.336 --> 1:31:21.752
Oh, god.

1:31:21.786 --> 1:31:22.615
Oh, god.

1:31:35.559 --> 1:31:37.733
[sobbing]

1:31:45.776 --> 1:31:48.157
- In light of the
evidence presented

1:31:48.192 --> 1:31:50.988
and the university's
zero tolerance position

1:31:51.022 --> 1:31:52.368
on sexual harassment,

1:31:53.577 --> 1:31:55.820
the chair feels that
we have no choice

1:31:55.855 --> 1:31:59.065
but to recommend that Dr.
Brower's tenure be revoked

1:31:59.099 --> 1:32:00.584
and that his employment
at the university

1:32:00.618 --> 1:32:03.172
be terminated
effective immediately.

1:32:03.207 --> 1:32:04.449
All those in favor?

1:32:08.557 --> 1:32:09.385
Opposed?

1:32:11.146 --> 1:32:12.043
The ayes have it.

1:32:13.044 --> 1:32:14.874
This concludes our proceedings.

1:32:14.908 --> 1:32:17.980
[papers shuffling]

1:32:18.015 --> 1:32:21.915
[committee chattering quietly]

1:32:39.830 --> 1:32:42.660
[phone vibrating]

1:33:18.316 --> 1:33:21.734
[agents speaking French]

1:33:23.805 --> 1:33:28.154
- What did you just say?
- I told him to move closer.

1:33:54.180 --> 1:33:55.043
- Where's Mother?

1:33:56.009 --> 1:33:57.252
- Don't worry about it.

1:33:57.286 --> 1:33:58.425
You're dealing with us.

1:34:01.118 --> 1:34:02.291
- No.

1:34:02.326 --> 1:34:03.638
No Mother, no deal.

1:34:08.573 --> 1:34:09.436
- Jake!

1:34:11.128 --> 1:34:12.094
Where you going?

1:34:13.233 --> 1:34:15.132
- What is this, a joke?

1:34:15.166 --> 1:34:17.513
[Mother speaking French]

1:34:17.548 --> 1:34:18.791
- Come back here.

1:34:25.729 --> 1:34:29.111
[Mother speaking French]

1:34:34.772 --> 1:34:37.292
- Is this everything?
- Mm-hmm.

1:34:38.327 --> 1:34:39.915
- Do you mind?
- Mm.

1:34:55.655 --> 1:34:58.485
[bottle rattling]

1:35:13.638 --> 1:35:14.467
Okay.

1:35:16.641 --> 1:35:18.264
Where's the rest?

1:35:18.298 --> 1:35:20.300
- What, you don't trust
me anymore, Mother?

1:35:22.337 --> 1:35:24.304
- This is Montreal, my friend.

1:35:25.167 --> 1:35:27.791
Strange things happen here.

1:35:27.825 --> 1:35:29.068
- That's $1 million.

1:35:29.102 --> 1:35:30.552
That's my deposit,
like we discussed.

1:35:30.586 --> 1:35:31.380
Now what's gonna happen is-
[guns cocking]

1:35:31.415 --> 1:35:33.382
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:35:33.417 --> 1:35:34.729
I'm reaching for my phone.

1:35:35.695 --> 1:35:37.248
All right, everybody calm down.

1:35:38.871 --> 1:35:40.493
Now I text my guys.

1:35:40.527 --> 1:35:43.289
- All right, we move when
they come in with the cash.

1:35:43.323 --> 1:35:45.601
- Then they're gonna park
two trucks down at the end

1:35:45.636 --> 1:35:46.602
and your goons are
gonna help them

1:35:46.637 --> 1:35:48.052
load up all these pallets.

1:35:48.087 --> 1:35:50.434
After that-
[rumbling]

1:35:50.468 --> 1:35:51.642
[Mother speaking French]

1:35:51.676 --> 1:35:52.988
- Tell your man to
stand down, right now.

1:35:53.023 --> 1:35:54.231
- I want a better view

1:35:54.265 --> 1:35:55.335
if we're gonna send
our guys in there.

1:35:55.370 --> 1:35:56.716
- You heard that?

1:35:56.751 --> 1:35:57.544
[indistinct]

1:35:57.579 --> 1:35:58.753
Check it out.

1:35:58.787 --> 1:35:59.857
- What the hell is
going on here, Mother?

1:35:59.892 --> 1:36:01.479
- We wait one minute, okay?

1:36:01.514 --> 1:36:02.998
- No, no more minutes.

1:36:03.033 --> 1:36:05.483
My guys come in and we
do the switch right now!

1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:12.525
[gunshots]
[shouting in French]

1:36:13.112 --> 1:36:15.804

1:36:15.839 --> 1:36:17.219
[sirens blaring]

1:36:17.254 --> 1:36:18.289
- Go, go, go!

1:36:18.324 --> 1:36:21.776
Go out!
[shouting in French]

1:36:21.810 --> 1:36:26.781

[gunshots]

1:37:29.326 --> 1:37:32.639
- [Stan] Freeze, motherfucker!

1:37:32.674 --> 1:37:34.883
[gunshots]

1:37:37.023 --> 1:37:41.510
- No!
[gunshots]

1:37:44.168 --> 1:37:45.066
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:37:45.100 --> 1:37:46.722
[Stan groaning]

1:37:46.757 --> 1:37:47.862
No, no, no.

1:37:47.896 --> 1:37:48.690
No, no, no.

1:37:48.724 --> 1:37:49.518
No!

1:37:49.553 --> 1:37:50.692
Look at me, it's okay!

1:37:50.726 --> 1:37:51.520
Man down!

1:37:51.555 --> 1:37:52.383
Man down!

1:37:53.695 --> 1:37:54.903
Oh, goddamn.

1:37:54.938 --> 1:37:56.042
Help!

1:37:56.077 --> 1:37:56.905
Help!

1:38:12.714 --> 1:38:15.786
- The division takes the
opioid crisis very seriously.

1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.444
As the president
himself has said,

1:38:18.478 --> 1:38:21.481
there is no greater scourge
facing America from within.

1:38:21.516 --> 1:38:22.827
- Well, I still fail to see

1:38:22.862 --> 1:38:24.864
how a breakthrough
drug, like Klaralon,

1:38:24.899 --> 1:38:26.866
despite the purported
implications

1:38:26.901 --> 1:38:28.833
of Dr. Brower's so-called tests-

1:38:28.868 --> 1:38:30.801
- Mr. Chairman, respectfully,

1:38:30.835 --> 1:38:32.907
Dr. Brower's implications
are more than purported.

1:38:32.941 --> 1:38:34.494
- According to Dr.
Brower's own report,

1:38:34.529 --> 1:38:36.082
he exceeded the
study parameters.

1:38:36.117 --> 1:38:37.497
- And that's precisely
why he was able

1:38:37.532 --> 1:38:38.878
to find the results he did.

1:38:38.913 --> 1:38:40.328
I think we should
hear from Dr. Brower.

1:38:40.362 --> 1:38:41.812
- One moment, please.

1:38:41.846 --> 1:38:43.055
- Okay, are we talking about
a [indistinct] shutdown?

1:38:43.089 --> 1:38:45.402
[indistinct]

1:38:45.436 --> 1:38:47.162
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1:38:49.337 --> 1:38:51.546
- Thank you, Dr. Brower,
that won't be necessary.

1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:53.065
The division has
discussed the matter

1:38:53.099 --> 1:38:54.618
and is prepared to
make a decision.

1:38:54.652 --> 1:38:55.826
- Mr. Chairman, I object
to a decision without-

1:38:55.860 --> 1:38:58.311
- That's enough, Mr. Walker.

1:38:58.346 --> 1:39:00.589
The division has
read the evidence

1:39:00.624 --> 1:39:02.695
and it is our position
that the benefits

1:39:02.729 --> 1:39:06.354
of the item outweigh
these potential risks.

1:39:06.388 --> 1:39:10.151
FDA approval for
Klaralon will proceed.

1:39:10.185 --> 1:39:12.291
Northlight Pharmaceuticals
will arrange a fund

1:39:12.325 --> 1:39:14.051
for further studies of addiction

1:39:14.086 --> 1:39:15.984
in the amount of $11 million.

1:39:16.019 --> 1:39:17.296
Do you all agree?

1:39:17.330 --> 1:39:18.159
- [Division Members] Agreed.

1:39:18.193 --> 1:39:19.677
- Mr. Chairman.

1:39:19.712 --> 1:39:21.921
Mr. Chairman, at
least let me speak!

1:39:21.956 --> 1:39:23.267
- Sorry, Dr. Brower.

1:39:23.302 --> 1:39:24.579
Meeting is adjourned.

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:28.341

1:39:30.274 --> 1:39:33.898
[group chattering quietly]

1:39:58.958 --> 1:40:00.132
- What happened?

1:40:00.166 --> 1:40:01.685
- I've been reassigned.

1:40:03.307 --> 1:40:05.930
[Tyrone sighs]

1:40:11.902 --> 1:40:13.041
- So, that's it?

1:40:13.076 --> 1:40:13.938
It's over?

1:40:15.250 --> 1:40:17.252
There's gotta be another way.

1:40:18.357 --> 1:40:20.117
- I've been thinking.

1:40:20.152 --> 1:40:21.532
There's someone you can talk to,

1:40:21.567 --> 1:40:24.052
but without the
committee's protection,

1:40:24.087 --> 1:40:26.710
you'd have to violate
your non-disclosure.

1:40:26.744 --> 1:40:27.711
- And?

1:40:27.745 --> 1:40:29.402
- And if it goes
bad for you now,

1:40:29.437 --> 1:40:32.060
we're talking debts
surviving bankruptcy.

1:40:32.095 --> 1:40:34.476
You'd probably still be
paying in the afterlife.

1:40:37.031 --> 1:40:38.377
- Well, I got nothing now,

1:40:39.826 --> 1:40:42.553
so what difference
would it make?

1:40:44.038 --> 1:40:46.971
[bubbling]

1:40:47.006 --> 1:40:50.665
[Emmie breathing heavily]

1:40:50.699 --> 1:40:51.493
- Jake.

1:40:53.047 --> 1:40:54.255
It's your sister.

1:40:57.637 --> 1:41:02.194
I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry for the other day,

1:41:03.298 --> 1:41:08.062
and I'm feeling much better now.

1:41:12.859 --> 1:41:13.826
I love you so much.

1:41:24.768 --> 1:41:26.080
- [RCMP Chief] We're
still ID-ing the bodies,

1:41:26.114 --> 1:41:27.184
but from what we can tell,

1:41:27.219 --> 1:41:29.221
they were low-level muscle.

1:41:29.255 --> 1:41:31.119
No traffickers.

1:41:31.154 --> 1:41:32.327
- What about Mother?

1:41:32.362 --> 1:41:34.329
- Apparently he's got
some family in Algiers,

1:41:34.364 --> 1:41:35.779
so we put some men
on the airports,

1:41:35.813 --> 1:41:38.506
but we're not gonna
see him again.

1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:40.059
How about the Armenians?

1:41:40.094 --> 1:41:43.131
- Prosecutor says he doesn't
have enough to charge them.

1:41:43.166 --> 1:41:44.305
- What?

1:41:44.339 --> 1:41:45.306
- They never set
foot in the building,

1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:46.548
let alone the lot.

1:41:46.583 --> 1:41:48.688
There's no overt act.

1:41:48.723 --> 1:41:50.690
- We'll issue a Red
Notice for Mother,

1:41:50.725 --> 1:41:53.762
but beyond that my superiors
wanna terminate cooperation.

1:41:53.797 --> 1:41:55.799
- Yeah, mine too.

1:41:55.833 --> 1:41:56.627
- So, that's it?

1:41:57.594 --> 1:41:58.974
You're just gonna quit?

1:41:59.009 --> 1:41:59.906
- Calm down, Jake.

1:41:59.941 --> 1:42:01.805
- Two crown officers are dead.

1:42:01.839 --> 1:42:04.704
My department won't risk
any more loss of life.

1:42:04.739 --> 1:42:05.809
I'm sorry.

1:42:12.850 --> 1:42:13.851
- Agent Kelly.

1:42:16.958 --> 1:42:17.959
- What?

1:42:17.993 --> 1:42:19.167
What do you want me to say?

1:42:19.202 --> 1:42:20.582
What do you want from me?

1:42:20.617 --> 1:42:23.516
- I want you to calm
down and be professional.

1:42:23.551 --> 1:42:24.552
- Professional what?

1:42:24.586 --> 1:42:26.105
Agent or drug dealer?

1:42:27.175 --> 1:42:28.521
You realize how fucked this is?

1:42:28.556 --> 1:42:29.936
- Yeah, I do.

1:42:29.971 --> 1:42:32.732
I'm the one who had
to call Stan's wife.

1:42:32.767 --> 1:42:34.148
He was my friend, too.

1:42:37.530 --> 1:42:38.359
- I'm sorry.

1:42:39.532 --> 1:42:41.293
- What do you think
we're here to do?

1:42:41.327 --> 1:42:42.811
To make a difference?

1:42:42.846 --> 1:42:44.986
- So, what are we here to do?

1:42:45.020 --> 1:42:46.470
- Our job.

1:42:46.505 --> 1:42:48.852
As mandated by the people.

1:42:48.886 --> 1:42:52.131
- So, we're just here
to clean up, is that it?

1:42:52.166 --> 1:42:54.375
I don't accept that.

1:42:54.409 --> 1:42:55.583
- That's not fair, Jake.

1:42:57.101 --> 1:42:58.896
You're a good agent.

1:42:58.931 --> 1:43:00.691
We fight the best we can.

1:43:02.728 --> 1:43:04.626
- I'll see you at the airport.

1:43:04.661 --> 1:43:07.767
[slow intense music]

1:43:09.942 --> 1:43:10.770
- Fuck.

1:43:19.089 --> 1:43:20.401
- [Jim] Hello, Ms. Reimann?

1:43:20.435 --> 1:43:23.231
This is Jim Douglas,
Douglas Investigations.

1:43:23.266 --> 1:43:26.993
I'm just following up on that
individual that we spoke of.

1:43:27.028 --> 1:43:27.994
You asked me to let you know

1:43:28.029 --> 1:43:30.342
if I had any new information.

1:43:30.376 --> 1:43:33.966
Well, I think you might
be interested in this.

1:44:01.718 --> 1:44:04.099
- Where's Mother?
[bartender speaking French]

1:44:04.134 --> 1:44:06.378
I will blow your head all
over this fucking bar.

1:44:06.412 --> 1:44:07.586
Where's Mother?

1:44:07.620 --> 1:44:09.243
- [speaking French]
I don't know!

1:44:11.175 --> 1:44:12.660
- Last chance.

1:44:12.694 --> 1:44:15.835
- He keeps a seaplane by
the Dwyer shipping yard.

1:44:15.870 --> 1:44:17.043
That's all I know.

1:44:17.078 --> 1:44:18.597
- If I find out
you're lying to me-

1:44:18.631 --> 1:44:19.736
- It's the truth!

1:44:19.770 --> 1:44:20.875
I swear it!

1:45:58.144 --> 1:45:58.973
- Mother!

1:46:03.115 --> 1:46:06.049
[gunshots]

1:46:06.083 --> 1:46:08.741
[Claire groans]

1:46:12.193 --> 1:46:12.987
- Hey, hey, hey.

1:46:13.021 --> 1:46:14.402
Hey.
- What?

1:46:14.437 --> 1:46:15.921
- It's okay, hey, relax.

1:46:15.955 --> 1:46:17.025
Relax, relax.
- Get away from me!

1:46:17.060 --> 1:46:17.854
- I'm a federal agent.

1:46:17.888 --> 1:46:18.786
I'm a federal agent.

1:46:18.820 --> 1:46:19.649
It's okay.

1:46:20.546 --> 1:46:21.409
It's okay.

1:46:21.444 --> 1:46:22.376
It's okay.

1:46:22.410 --> 1:46:23.894
Let me see.

1:46:23.929 --> 1:46:24.826
Fuck. Okay.

1:46:24.861 --> 1:46:25.827
It just went through your arm.

1:46:25.862 --> 1:46:26.759
You're gonna be okay.

1:46:26.794 --> 1:46:27.726
Come on.

1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:30.418
[Claire groans]

1:46:32.972 --> 1:46:33.801
It's okay.

1:46:34.871 --> 1:46:35.941
There you go.

1:46:45.571 --> 1:46:46.641
Stay right here.

1:46:46.676 --> 1:46:48.574
I'll be right back.
[exhales]

1:47:28.234 --> 1:47:30.409
[gunshot]

1:48:01.475 --> 1:48:04.408
[doorbell ringing]

1:48:10.380 --> 1:48:11.277
- [Geoff] Already?

1:48:12.658 --> 1:48:16.282
- [Tyrone] The university
gave us three days to vacate.

1:48:16.317 --> 1:48:19.009
- Where to?
- I don't know.

1:48:20.597 --> 1:48:22.634
- How long did we
work together, Tyrone?

1:48:22.668 --> 1:48:23.876
- A long time.

1:48:23.911 --> 1:48:27.328
- And in that time,
didn't I support you,

1:48:27.362 --> 1:48:31.539
and champion your labs,
and find you grant money

1:48:31.574 --> 1:48:32.989
wherever the hell I could,

1:48:34.128 --> 1:48:36.199
help keep your whole
field of research alive?

1:48:36.233 --> 1:48:39.236
- Yeah, yeah, you
did all of that.

1:48:39.271 --> 1:48:42.481
- Whatever I did, I never
compromised our university.

1:48:42.516 --> 1:48:44.069
And I never compromised
our students.

1:48:44.103 --> 1:48:46.692
- Geoff, all you
did was compromise.

1:48:46.727 --> 1:48:49.937
You had the facts and you
just didn't look at them.

1:48:49.971 --> 1:48:52.905
You stood there while
they made you complicit.

1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:56.081
- I spent a lifetime
building that school.

1:48:56.115 --> 1:48:58.566
That I should take a
moment before deciding

1:48:58.601 --> 1:48:59.809
whether or not to destroy it

1:48:59.843 --> 1:49:01.604
supporting your
half-baked research

1:49:01.638 --> 1:49:03.088
against a drug monolith.

1:49:03.122 --> 1:49:04.330
- What about the people,

1:49:04.365 --> 1:49:06.229
the ones that we're
supposed to serve,

1:49:06.263 --> 1:49:08.265
the ones who can't
speak for themselves?

1:49:14.651 --> 1:49:16.411
- It's the Detroit Evening News.

1:49:19.311 --> 1:49:21.106
You gave them the
whole story, huh?

1:49:22.625 --> 1:49:24.661
Even everything that
happened between us.

1:49:25.628 --> 1:49:26.905
I thought we were friends.

1:49:27.871 --> 1:49:28.700
- So did I.

1:49:30.356 --> 1:49:31.426
- You know this isn't gonna make

1:49:31.461 --> 1:49:33.428
a damn bit of difference
to Northlight.

1:49:34.568 --> 1:49:36.604
They've got their approval.

1:49:36.639 --> 1:49:38.157
They'll still put
their drug out.

1:49:38.192 --> 1:49:39.538
- But the people will know.

1:49:40.919 --> 1:49:42.472
They'll know.

1:49:42.506 --> 1:49:44.025
And that's the best I could do.

1:49:46.441 --> 1:49:48.616
- I've been asked to resign.

1:49:48.651 --> 1:49:49.444
- I'm sorry.

1:49:50.342 --> 1:49:51.895
- Me, too.

1:49:51.930 --> 1:49:53.587
If I could do it all over again.

1:49:55.623 --> 1:49:56.451
Oh.

1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:00.248
What difference does it make?

1:50:00.283 --> 1:50:01.215
Bye, Tyrone.

1:50:08.291 --> 1:50:10.707
[slow music]

1:50:26.136 --> 1:50:29.139
- Hopefully it looks
like two gangsters

1:50:29.174 --> 1:50:31.107
killed each other
for a million dollars

1:50:32.418 --> 1:50:33.799
and no one looks any deeper.

1:50:36.699 --> 1:50:38.286
- Didn't you say you were a cop?

1:50:39.529 --> 1:50:40.323
- I was.

1:50:42.946 --> 1:50:45.224
- [Claire] So are you
taking me to prison now?

1:50:49.988 --> 1:50:50.782
- No.

1:50:52.128 --> 1:50:52.922
- Why not?

1:50:57.823 --> 1:50:59.376
- You remind me of someone.

1:51:03.001 --> 1:51:05.003
[Claire gasps]
- Sorry.

1:51:05.037 --> 1:51:05.866
I'm sorry.

1:51:08.006 --> 1:51:12.079
- [exhaling] I don't understand.

1:51:13.252 --> 1:51:15.530
So, what am I
supposed to do now?

1:51:19.845 --> 1:51:20.674
- I don't know.

1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:40.348
- Thank you.

1:51:51.187 --> 1:51:53.327
- And given the doctor's
ongoing press schedule

1:51:53.361 --> 1:51:55.053
that you may have heard about,

1:51:55.087 --> 1:51:56.779
if any of you ever get out

1:51:56.813 --> 1:51:59.022
of your labs long enough
to read the paper,

1:51:59.057 --> 1:51:59.954
[students laughing]

1:51:59.989 --> 1:52:01.887
we were very lucky to get him.

1:52:01.922 --> 1:52:04.959
So, I hope you'll all
join me in welcoming

1:52:04.994 --> 1:52:07.203
our new co-chair of biology

1:52:07.237 --> 1:52:09.757
here at University of Michigan.

1:52:09.792 --> 1:52:13.243
Dr. Tyrone Brower.
[applauding]

1:52:15.729 --> 1:52:16.730
- Thank you!

1:52:19.387 --> 1:52:22.874
Thank you, and welcome to
my class... [intense music]

1:56:18.247 --> 1:56:21.836
[intense electronic music]
