I went through a period.

01:20.524 --> 01:22.759
when sex had to be violent.

01:26.703 --> 01:29.603
I was desperate to feel something real.

I think you should tell him...

11:01.788 --> 11:03.233
about us.

11:07.024 --> 11:08.336
We were together

11:09.031 --> 11:10.719
before he even knew us.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.304
Right.

11:20.243 --> 11:21.844
- Are you looking?
- Yes!

11:22.239 --> 11:24.000
Oh, yeah!

11:24.164 --> 11:27.789
That's old. That's been there.

11:44.018 --> 11:45.893
Oh, I was there this summer.

11:48.699 --> 11:50.736
What about a job?
You working this year?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.872
I have a few different jobs,
you know?

11:52.937 --> 11:54.075
You looking around?

11:54.138 --> 11:55.548
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Yeah?

11:55.603 --> 11:57.182
You worry about me, Daddy?

11:57.777 --> 11:59.612
I just wanna know what you're doing.

12:00.044 --> 12:01.721
Am I prying too much?

12:01.983 --> 12:03.651
There is someone, but...

12:04.415 --> 12:06.156
I'm not really sure what's gonna happen.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.940
Oh! Okay-

12:09.213 --> 12:12.635
But does he play out, like,
make money playing and stuff'?

12:12.923 --> 12:14.129
- He does'?
- Mm-hmm.

12:14.299 --> 12:15.602
So he's a working musician?

12:15.713 --> 12:18.143
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well, that's good to hear.

12:21.394 --> 12:22.941
You think I could meet him?

12:26.063 --> 12:27.602
Maybe someday.

12:34.807 --> 12:36.588
Do you trust this man?

12:41.237 --> 12:43.643
You know, we never hear from you.

12:50.661 --> 12:53.432
Your mom and I wanna come up
and visit together sometime.

12:56.441 --> 12:58.096
She really misses you.

13:00.869 --> 13:02.651
We just want you to be happy.

13:03.061 --> 13:04.404
Whatever you're doing.

13:05.539 --> 13:06.744
I know.

13:07.879 --> 13:09.198
Who am I?

13:13.686 --> 13:15.377
I show apartments.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.987
A dog walker.

13:32.494 --> 13:35.815
I thought we could
just roll and tumble.

13:38.379 --> 13:40.924
Live from song to song.

13:43.704 --> 13:45.432
Kiss to kiss.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.330
What's that for'?

13:56.843 --> 13:58.299
"X" marks the spot.

14:02.053 --> 14:03.713
I love your soul.

14:11.057 --> 14:12.245
Go, "Ah."

14:12.343 --> 14:14.289
Ah...

14:14.378 --> 14:15.379
Oh, no.

14:15.446 --> 14:16.815
What's the matter?

14:17.068 --> 14:18.068
Let me see.

14:21.155 --> 14:23.164
Can you see my soul?

14:24.855 --> 14:26.344
Is it still there?

14:30.992 --> 14:32.274
What's so funny?

14:36.700 --> 14:37.974
How well do you know this guy?

14:38.068 --> 14:40.118
And how come he's letting you
stay at his place?

15:07.251 --> 15:08.860
You shouldn't trust him.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.571
Why not?

15:20.973 --> 15:22.946
I just think you should be careful.

15:33.590 --> 15:34.668
Ladies and gentlemen...

15:37.528 --> 15:38.933
He said, "Trust me."

15:40.153 --> 15:42.614
- We should make a record together.
- And I did.

15:42.731 --> 15:44.677
I know you do the live music thing
and everything else,

15:44.724 --> 15:46.817
but don't you wanna
make some money?

15:47.004 --> 15:49.474
Whatever I wanted,
he'd make it happen.

15:50.530 --> 15:51.966
You've got talent.

16:06.488 --> 16:07.779
You want one of those?

16:08.745 --> 16:10.427
You wanna be me?

16:11.324 --> 16:13.333
Where do you get a jacket like this?

16:16.259 --> 16:17.755
Makes you walk different.

16:19.607 --> 16:21.048
Get you a hundred jackets like that.

16:21.262 --> 16:22.605
How long you lived here?

16:23.243 --> 16:24.581
About two weeks.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.716
I don't like it.

16:26.935 --> 16:28.517
It's all for sale.

16:29.313 --> 16:30.529
All of it...

16:32.109 --> 16:34.302
honors, titles.

16:36.253 --> 16:38.146
This, none of this exists.

16:46.497 --> 16:47.763
What do you see?

16:52.796 --> 16:53.824
Pool?

16:53.872 --> 16:55.146
It's a stage show.

17:10.685 --> 17:12.372
It's all just free fall.

17:34.722 --> 17:36.365
You have too much pride.

17:38.429 --> 17:40.177
I thought pride was a good thing.

17:43.901 --> 17:45.185
People aren't proud enough.

17:45.287 --> 17:46.474
Selfish!

17:46.667 --> 17:48.669
Arrogant! Conceited!

17:49.960 --> 17:51.598
If you know what's good for you,

17:51.662 --> 17:53.801
you will stay as far away

17:53.897 --> 17:56.104
from this man as you possibly can!

17:58.910 --> 18:01.068
People changed around him.

18:02.676 --> 18:04.130
They did things.

18:06.983 --> 18:08.388
So did I.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.122
He leaves us alone this way.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.919
Because he wants to be free.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.802
All his life, he's tried to get free.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.037
He doesn't know how.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.497
You aren't who you think you are.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.297
He doesn't love you.

19:04.301 --> 19:05.977
I like you this way.

19:16.547 --> 19:19.680
I wanted to be free the way he was.

19:27.758 --> 19:29.703
I went on seeing him.

19:32.445 --> 19:34.875
I let myself be smashed.

19:45.108 --> 19:46.311
You can't?

19:46.878 --> 19:48.365
Well, why can't you?

19:53.029 --> 19:54.865
Do you trust me to stick
your finger in here?

19:55.001 --> 19:56.357
He did everything.

19:59.024 --> 20:01.592
He exhausted every poison.

20:04.349 --> 20:09.428
He knew every form of love,
suffering, madness.

20:13.163 --> 20:14.948
Learn all the rules
when you're young,

20:15.038 --> 20:16.984
'cause that makes
Mom and Dad happy.

20:17.074 --> 20:19.217
And then throw the fucking
lot of them out the window.

20:19.329 --> 20:21.436
And they want you to!
They want you to!

20:21.600 --> 20:25.413
So that he could
reach the unknown.

20:31.555 --> 20:33.211
He experimented.

20:44.514 --> 20:47.000
They scare you with names.

20:49.231 --> 20:50.976
Like wickedness.

21:01.639 --> 21:04.053
You liked it; that I did what I liked.

21:15.010 --> 21:17.147
I pulled you down in the car.

21:26.643 --> 21:28.987
You realize that, um...

21:29.035 --> 21:30.446
you know, it's like the sea.

21:30.514 --> 21:31.622
Things come in and out.

21:31.670 --> 21:33.342
We feel happy and ecstatic.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.950
And then, you know, hours later,

21:35.998 --> 21:38.298
you know, we feel
the deepest sorrows, or...

21:38.355 --> 21:40.772
I didn't believe enough in love.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.639
Afraid it would burn me up.

21:56.438 --> 21:58.213
Be ready to suffer.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.628
Don't be afraid.

21:59.811 --> 22:01.689
I saw my husband.

22:01.772 --> 22:04.834
I saw this boy across the room.

22:05.048 --> 22:06.881
And I loved... I...

22:07.834 --> 22:09.031
I just...

22:09.186 --> 22:12.209
loved him the first
moment I saw him.

22:12.589 --> 22:14.014
And we had a life.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.467
And it was beautiful,
and it was difficult.

22:18.631 --> 22:21.991
And I thought I would be
with him for the rest of my life.

22:22.747 --> 22:24.248
But he died.

22:50.327 --> 22:53.475
I wanted to escape from every tie.

22:55.294 --> 22:56.787
Every hold.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.991
To have life at any price.

23:02.993 --> 23:04.452
Not to settle.

23:08.737 --> 23:09.873

32:46.358 --> 32:49.895
I was a teacher, but there's
not many jobs around here.

32:50.085 --> 32:51.687
- What do you teach?
- Kindergarten.

32:51.780 --> 32:53.101
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

32:54.307 --> 32:55.515
You like kids?

32:55.998 --> 32:58.303
Yes, I do.
It wouldn't be a very good job

- No.

33:06.119 --> 33:07.616

33:07.810 --> 33:08.937
Yes.

33:25.027 --> 33:26.308

I'll listen to everything.

34:09.138 --> 34:11.262
The record companies would sort of...

34:11.348 --> 34:12.989
They did... they believed in artistry...

I met him
on the street today, and he, um...

47:50.621 --> 47:52.318
said that he wanted to sign me.

48:02.457 --> 48:03.700
Wow.

48:04.439 --> 48:05.747
I didn't know what to tell him.

48:05.807 --> 48:08.152
Why not? I mean,
this is... that's a good...

48:11.200 --> 48:13.215
That's a good opportunity for you.

48:15.996 --> 48:18.356
I mean, you know how I feel
about him, but that...

48:20.944 --> 48:22.840
that shouldn't affect your...

48:25.714 --> 48:27.176
that shouldn't affect you.

48:41.139 --> 48:42.246
You gotta do it.

49:19.733 --> 49:20.835
Why are you crying?

49:26.846 --> 49:28.018
Because I'm happy.

50:14.521 --> 50:16.014
Your old girlfriend...

50:17.099 --> 50:19.098
she asked you to go off with her.

50:24.814 --> 50:26.293
Why didn't you?

50:29.970 --> 50:31.040
Was it for me?

50:31.168 --> 50:33.364
Do you ever
think of me when I'm not here?

50:34.958 --> 50:37.473
- Sure.
- Well, what do you think?

50:40.729 --> 50:44.231
Why wake up next to someone
you don't even know

50:44.286 --> 50:46.317
if you don't even
know yourself anymore?

50:47.996 --> 50:50.816
What happens then?
Do you think she'll be happy...

50:51.957 --> 50:54.228
living with ghosts, sadder?

50:54.356 --> 50:57.113
- It's more complicated than that.
- No, it's not.

50:59.965 --> 51:01.902
What's it feel like to be a girl?

51:02.104 --> 51:03.949

51:20.856 --> 51:22.809
How to be sick to your bones.

51:25.066 --> 51:26.527
How to yearn.

51:33.582 --> 51:34.777
Stay.

51:36.809 --> 51:38.652
You're casting spells.

51:40.025 --> 51:41.129
Does it work?

51:41.708 --> 51:43.340

That's one thing I know.
You can't have it all.

Well, then I gotta go.

58:42.799 --> 58:45.509
I was a receptionist there
before I met you.

58:47.048 --> 58:48.627
You know, I...

58:48.799 --> 58:49.851
He's after you.

58:49.918 --> 58:52.986
I dreamed of having him help me
the same way he helped you.

58:58.026 --> 58:59.728
You don't have to, uh...

59:04.111 --> 59:05.783
you know, hide anything.

59:11.244 --> 59:13.783
We don't have to have
any secrets between us.

59:27.784 --> 59:30.526

if he's not attracted to you?

59:52.755 --> 59:54.283
Did you ever sleep with him?

01:00:08.915 --> 01:00:10.009
Yes.

01:00:15.973 --> 01:00:16.974
You did?

01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:22.259
Once.

01:00:24.933 --> 01:00:26.533
How come you never told me?

01:00:38.776 --> 01:00:40.291
Tell me about the teacher.

01:00:45.984 --> 01:00:47.150
Just tell me.

01:00:48.595 --> 01:00:50.879
- Tell me what you did.
- I don't remember.

01:00:50.972 --> 01:00:52.144
Try and remember.

01:00:53.134 --> 01:00:54.783
- I can't
- Try and remember.

01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:57.212
It was dark. I don't know.

01:00:57.632 --> 01:00:59.361
He told us what to do.

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:01.939
Did you do it?

01:01:02.244 --> 01:01:03.325
Yes.

01:01:03.454 --> 01:01:05.259
You did what he told you to do?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.803
I wanna live a good life.

01:01:35.377 --> 01:01:37.152
Hmm? How many times?

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:42.955
We had...

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:45.713
a sort of a romance, I guess.

01:01:47.752 --> 01:01:50.634
No, it was more than once.
It was several times.

01:01:54.258 --> 01:01:55.916
Why'd you just do that?

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:00.134
Do what?

01:02:00.502 --> 01:02:01.947
Change your story.

01:02:04.226 --> 01:02:06.369
I was trying it out to see how you'd do.

01:03:16.962 --> 01:03:18.400
I'm a beast.

01:03:23.337 --> 01:03:25.533
Still not unhappy about it.

01:03:33.432 --> 01:03:36.509
I don't seem to bring people
happiness anymore.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.696
I wasted your love.

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:14.064
I was wrong.

01:04:19.561 --> 01:04:21.103
Will you forgive me?

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:29.845
We broke up.

01:04:41.855 --> 01:04:43.338
I tried to be kind.

01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:46.080
It only made me colder.

01:05:32.516 --> 01:05:34.325
What part of me do you want?

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:40.193
Take what you want from me.

01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:50.771
Let me untie them.

01:05:54.425 --> 01:05:55.836
Untie mine.

01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:14.400
In our state
and even across our border.

01:06:29.677 --> 01:06:31.213
We would express that generosity

01:06:31.312 --> 01:06:34.521
not just in this moment
or on this campus,

01:06:34.781 --> 01:06:36.994
but as we have
opportunity every day

01:06:37.051 --> 01:06:39.053
throughout our community
and our city,

01:06:39.153 --> 01:06:42.032
around our state, even
across our borders.

01:06:42.089 --> 01:06:45.400
And we will be known
as a generous people.

01:06:45.493 --> 01:06:48.599
And we bless even as
we have been blessed.

01:06:48.696 --> 01:06:51.609
For we ask this in Your Son's name.

01:06:51.699 --> 01:06:52.699
Amen.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.768
Gives you life.

01:07:28.154 --> 01:07:29.155
Eat it.

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:32.973
I've tasted it.

01:07:34.258 --> 01:07:35.356
Tried it.

01:07:43.271 --> 01:07:44.966
This is dipped in God.

01:08:03.363 --> 01:08:05.324
They've never been
where we've been.

01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:22.192
Open your eyes.

01:08:29.692 --> 01:08:30.934
Right here you know.

01:08:32.912 --> 01:08:34.511
You won't die.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:50.738
Here I reign.

01:08:54.203 --> 01:08:55.203
King.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.861
Who sees us?

01:09:21.377 --> 01:09:23.551
The world wants to be deceived.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:40.767
Think you'll be able to drive?

01:09:42.828 --> 01:09:44.923
- Taking that as a no.
- Our friend will pick us up.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.728
All right. You need to move on.

01:09:46.997 --> 01:09:48.587
We have a little fun right here.

01:09:48.883 --> 01:09:51.790
Quite frankly, I don't know if you're
gonna come back. Careful with that.

01:09:51.837 --> 01:09:53.078
You know that river?

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.920
This is a ticket around the world.

01:09:55.077 --> 01:09:56.277
Last call...

01:10:04.895 --> 01:10:07.215
Now leaving on track twelve.

01:10:07.861 --> 01:10:08.989

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:11.410
Whoa!

01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:27.381
What are you afraid of?

01:10:35.108 --> 01:10:37.155
What do you wanna do'?

01:10:53.757 --> 01:10:55.163
Are you afraid of me?

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.715
I was once like you.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.108
I didn't know what I know now.

01:11:33.606 --> 01:11:35.586
To think what I once was...

01:11:39.532 --> 01:11:41.001
what I am now.

01:11:50.153 --> 01:11:51.533
- Ls this your dog?
- Yeah.

01:11:51.632 --> 01:11:53.410
- Can I say hi?
- Yeah, of course.

01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:55.810
- Hi there.
- Say hello.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:57.660
What's your name?

01:11:59.434 --> 01:12:00.434
Look at you.

01:12:00.808 --> 01:12:01.918
Stuff like that.

01:12:03.177 --> 01:12:04.212
You what? What?

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:07.340
- Like, uh, uh, house-sit.
- House-sit? Oh.

01:12:18.025 --> 01:12:19.026
Hi.

01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:22.212
Very tired with the weather.

01:12:22.451 --> 01:12:24.563
So I decided to move here.

01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:28.610
I don't know if I would
move here from Paris.

01:12:30.806 --> 01:12:32.676
I wanted to experience it.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:36.079
Just let me know when I can
come over and take him out or...

01:12:36.577 --> 01:12:39.055
- Anything. If you need me to feed him.
- Tomorrow... if fine?

01:12:39.079 --> 01:12:41.306
- Where are you from?
- From here.

01:12:41.782 --> 01:12:44.058
Yeah, it's like the, um...

01:12:44.211 --> 01:12:46.845
the skin, I like this idea of, um...

01:12:47.032 --> 01:12:49.410
you know, losing your... your-your skin.

01:12:49.509 --> 01:12:51.648
- And, like, the phoenix.
- Yeah.

01:12:51.759 --> 01:12:52.962
You know, like...

01:12:53.527 --> 01:12:55.681
- Starting over'?
- Start... starting over.

01:12:55.896 --> 01:12:57.933
Dying and being reborn...

01:12:58.298 --> 01:13:00.073
The light is so beautiful on your face.

01:13:01.704 --> 01:13:04.548
You have one part of your face
in the shadows

01:13:04.605 --> 01:13:06.744
and one part in the light.

01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:55.851
- Are you scared?
- Mm-mm.

01:14:15.776 --> 01:14:17.742
You kissed me in public.

01:14:22.322 --> 01:14:24.275
You held my hand.

01:15:39.185 --> 01:15:40.365
Stay.

01:15:56.476 --> 01:15:59.202
Volunteer their time to make it so.

01:15:59.947 --> 01:16:02.179
The very traditions
of the Bachelors of Austin

01:16:02.233 --> 01:16:04.179
are the result of years of service

01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:06.488

This year, to help us usher in
and host a great social season,

01:16:14.428 --> 01:16:16.738
I would especially like
to thank Layne Cricket

01:16:16.835 --> 01:16:18.606

01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:20.624

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.866

01:16:31.079 --> 01:16:32.524
They say follow the light.

01:16:32.846 --> 01:16:35.171
So happy to meet you.

01:16:40.408 --> 01:16:42.069
Where do you find it?

01:16:45.025 --> 01:16:48.165
When you're young, it's not always
easy to know what is the light.

01:16:48.261 --> 01:16:49.921
- I don't understand either.
- Except for you.

01:16:49.969 --> 01:16:51.297
- It's different.
- Sweet of you to say.

01:16:51.343 --> 01:16:55.804
I hear you have songs on the radio
and you're meant for better things.

01:16:55.869 --> 01:16:59.339
It'd be awful to have these
good times and not have life itself.

01:16:59.439 --> 01:17:01.671
I wanna meet you before you move on

01:17:01.749 --> 01:17:03.589
- and leave us behind.
- Mm-hmm. No, thank you.

01:17:04.116 --> 01:17:06.546
Uh, she was mixed up
with a guy back East.

01:17:06.663 --> 01:17:08.356
He was a very nice man, I understand.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.022
Divorced, four kids, but...

01:17:20.548 --> 01:17:22.374

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:25.507
Yeah, I've been back
a couple of months.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:28.663
Mind me asking why?

01:17:29.202 --> 01:17:30.718
I was, uh, wondering.

01:17:31.928 --> 01:17:33.264
I grew up there.

01:17:33.897 --> 01:17:35.124
Oh, yeah?

01:17:37.477 --> 01:17:39.530
No, I went... I went away to school.

01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:41.311
Back East.

01:17:46.827 --> 01:17:49.335
I think you've got a secret
you're not telling me.

01:18:00.733 --> 01:18:02.069
What is that?

01:18:02.162 --> 01:18:03.225

01:32:14.414 --> 01:32:15.571
What'd you do?

01:32:16.923 --> 01:32:18.368
She's the wrong person for you.

01:32:18.509 --> 01:32:19.556
I'm sorry?

01:32:20.587 --> 01:32:21.641
It's wrong.

01:32:22.695 --> 01:32:25.437
Come on, honey. It's okay.

01:32:25.634 --> 01:32:27.368
I don't understand it, but...

01:32:36.776 --> 01:32:38.251
- Can I walk with you?
- No.

01:32:40.146 --> 01:32:41.915
I don't know how to change.

01:32:43.462 --> 01:32:44.703
I want to.

01:32:46.506 --> 01:32:47.720
How do you?

01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:50.290
Will you take me somewhere?

01:32:50.556 --> 01:32:52.095
How do you get better?

01:32:58.287 --> 01:33:00.431
Gotta sacrifice something.

01:33:04.232 --> 01:33:06.766
How do you know
when you're lying to yourself?

01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:20.196
When you give somebody your word...

01:33:22.878 --> 01:33:24.221
does it mean anything?

01:33:25.068 --> 01:33:26.759
You can just take it back.

01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:42.910
I told her that I'm gonna do my best.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.293
Do my best not to say things I don't mean.

01:34:24.289 --> 01:34:26.797
The world built
a fence around you.

01:34:31.072 --> 01:34:32.697
How do you get through?

01:34:36.952 --> 01:34:38.189
Connect?

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.493
There's something else.

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:56.508
Something that wants us to find it.

01:35:15.868 --> 01:35:17.867
You're the part that I don't know...

01:35:19.205 --> 01:35:21.203
that you don't know yourself.

01:35:30.916 --> 01:35:32.446
I swear.

01:35:35.039 --> 01:35:36.656
How long have
you been doing this?

01:35:37.133 --> 01:35:38.796
My dream was to be a teacher,

01:35:38.891 --> 01:35:41.235
but this is kind of something I just...

01:35:41.321 --> 01:35:43.637
I fell into after my fiancé passed.

01:35:43.867 --> 01:35:45.656
In memory for him, but...

01:35:46.132 --> 01:35:51.138
like, this is not something
that people just choose to do,

01:35:51.321 --> 01:35:53.945
so I'm trying... this is just
a means to an end for me.

01:35:54.117 --> 01:35:56.508
It was
so much better when he was around.

01:35:57.343 --> 01:35:59.482
But, you know...

01:36:00.813 --> 01:36:02.375
God has a plan, and...

01:36:02.485 --> 01:36:04.794
and I guess this is part of his plan.

01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:07.875
You know, Shawn being gone
and me being in this situation

01:36:07.969 --> 01:36:11.024
where I have no choice
but to do what I do, so...

01:36:11.461 --> 01:36:15.496
Eventually, maybe he'll hear
my prayers and I'll be able to...

01:36:15.633 --> 01:36:17.852
you know, move forward
and do something...

01:36:18.797 --> 01:36:19.946
valued with my life.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.274
Something my dad
can be proud of, you know.

01:36:22.701 --> 01:36:25.172
Make the money.
Don't let the money make you.

01:36:26.135 --> 01:36:27.742
Create the illusion,

01:36:27.961 --> 01:36:30.444
but don't let yourself
believe that illusion.

01:36:30.509 --> 01:36:32.383
Only make him believe it.

01:36:34.504 --> 01:36:36.625
Don't let yourself get caught up in it.

01:36:39.422 --> 01:36:41.641
I sell a fantasy, not my body.

01:36:41.727 --> 01:36:43.022
I sell an illusion.

01:36:43.188 --> 01:36:45.563
I sell, you know...

01:36:46.539 --> 01:36:48.335
a daydream to these guys.

01:36:48.794 --> 01:36:54.210
And I try to keep the cookie jar closed.

01:36:54.377 --> 01:36:55.558
Is that me?

01:36:59.505 --> 01:37:02.199
The cookie jar closed.

01:37:08.434 --> 01:37:09.597
You burn me.

01:37:15.716 --> 01:37:17.175
Who are you?

01:37:22.599 --> 01:37:24.582
I can't take this world straight.

01:37:44.787 --> 01:37:46.808
Big candy store out there.

01:37:47.353 --> 01:37:50.043
- I think I get a little insecure
- What do you like to drink?

01:37:50.122 --> 01:37:52.230
And... you know,
I just... I look for comfort...

01:37:52.285 --> 01:37:53.676
- in places I shouldn't.
- You like to get high?

01:37:53.723 --> 01:37:54.729
I don't know...

01:37:54.777 --> 01:37:55.907
It's kind of...

01:37:56.354 --> 01:37:57.355
I'm weird.

01:37:57.429 --> 01:37:59.429
- I'm just...
- What's your fantasy?

01:38:02.329 --> 01:38:03.722
What turns you on?

01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:06.996
I think just
being wanted turns me on.

01:38:07.437 --> 01:38:08.925
Tell me what scares you.

01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:12.254
I'm really scared of spiders.

01:38:13.324 --> 01:38:15.909
Um, but most things don't scare me.

01:38:16.815 --> 01:38:18.308
I think I have a thick skin.

01:38:18.499 --> 01:38:20.167
I think I'm pretty strong.

01:38:27.138 --> 01:38:28.879
No, but what really scares you?

01:38:31.263 --> 01:38:32.779
I don't know my family.

01:38:36.409 --> 01:38:38.075
No one's ever been there for me but me.

01:38:38.175 --> 01:38:40.308
You like those girls, don't you?

01:38:49.736 --> 01:38:51.526
They know what you are.

01:39:01.316 --> 01:39:02.746
When I was a girl,

01:39:04.523 --> 01:39:06.174
I loved everyone.

01:39:13.562 --> 01:39:15.187
You killed my love.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.143
What did I say?

01:39:46.905 --> 01:39:47.959
Do?

01:39:53.545 --> 01:39:55.514
Mom, I'm afraid of myself.

01:40:01.272 --> 01:40:02.764
A hatred in me.

01:40:10.469 --> 01:40:12.586
Everything I could do to get free...

01:40:12.977 --> 01:40:14.500
goes through my mind.

01:40:18.909 --> 01:40:20.081
Makes me evil.

01:40:20.485 --> 01:40:22.590
I used to think I could never be wicked.

01:40:23.456 --> 01:40:24.730
Wicked before.

01:40:26.044 --> 01:40:27.546
A long way out for me.

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.889
So much to seek to be consoled

01:40:29.948 --> 01:40:31.188
as to understand,

01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:33.758
to be loved as to love.

01:40:33.919 --> 01:40:36.957
For it is in giving that we receive.

01:40:37.055 --> 01:40:38.407
It is in pardoning...

01:40:38.564 --> 01:40:40.100
- Bang.
- Bang.

01:40:40.192 --> 01:40:42.263
Bang, may the blessings
of all those that you love

01:40:42.361 --> 01:40:43.828
and those who love you...

01:41:40.154 --> 01:41:41.319
Mama.

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.038
Where am I now?

01:41:49.533 --> 01:41:50.896
Where are we?

01:42:07.266 --> 01:42:12.360
I knew how destroyed... I was.

01:42:37.702 --> 01:42:38.843
Forgive me.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:54.662
In that time, did she have

01:42:54.754 --> 01:42:57.215
any medical history or medication?

01:43:01.266 --> 01:43:03.906
About her mental health issues?

01:43:04.002 --> 01:43:07.677
Had she ever had any variations.

01:43:07.865 --> 01:43:10.388
Or expressed any depression to you?

01:45:58.782 --> 01:46:00.400
You got food all over you.

01:46:34.874 --> 01:46:36.674
I just wanted to come...

01:46:37.678 --> 01:46:39.506
come and sit next to you.

01:46:48.644 --> 01:46:52.387
Things turned out a little different
than we thought they would, didn't they?

01:47:06.178 --> 01:47:07.589
They like carrots and apples.

01:47:07.693 --> 01:47:09.849
Every now and then,
I'll bring them one, but...

01:47:10.346 --> 01:47:11.693
They're spoiled now.

01:47:15.843 --> 01:47:20.515
These old guitars seem to have
a song ready-made for you.

01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:22.460
They always have old songs...

01:47:23.968 --> 01:47:27.202
loan... I can go on
for hours with one chord.

01:47:36.439 --> 01:47:38.507
It's just one chord hammering.

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:46.526
♪ Glory of a good man ♪

01:47:46.618 --> 01:47:50.691
♪ Come on and they carry him home... ♪

01:47:54.268 --> 01:47:55.503
Can you see?

01:47:56.361 --> 01:47:59.339
Yeah, she has a face... a face like yours.

01:48:17.482 --> 01:48:20.402
I do... I don't know... I didn't know
why I was coming to this party.

01:48:20.886 --> 01:48:23.286
Then I saw you,
and I thought, "That's why."

01:48:26.002 --> 01:48:27.427
You got a boyfriend?

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.270
No.

01:48:31.863 --> 01:48:34.263
I don't think so. Did we meet before?

01:48:36.868 --> 01:48:38.427
- Did we?
- I've seen you before.

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.856
- Where?
- Lots of times.

01:48:41.747 --> 01:48:44.528
But I mean, I'm...
I'm not doing anything wrong, am I?

01:48:45.959 --> 01:48:48.419
- By talking to you?
- No.

01:48:49.745 --> 01:48:51.466
There's something on your face.

01:48:53.324 --> 01:48:54.462
Did you get it?

01:48:54.519 --> 01:48:55.632
- Huh?
- Did you get it?

01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.716
Mm-mm.

01:48:57.289 --> 01:48:58.591
Gotta come closer.

01:49:03.595 --> 01:49:04.595
I got it.

01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:05.733
Thank you.

01:49:12.137 --> 01:49:13.138
Here we go.

01:49:13.238 --> 01:49:14.838
- Okay, start from the beginning.
- Okay.

01:49:15.937 --> 01:49:18.052
Does it start right there,
or does it have an intro'?

01:49:18.076 --> 01:49:19.340
Do you want it to...?

01:49:24.686 --> 01:49:25.824
But slower.

01:49:25.927 --> 01:49:27.636
It's a love story.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:19.320
Excuse... excuse me.

01:50:23.441 --> 01:50:24.442
Hey.

01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:26.510
Hi.

01:50:27.223 --> 01:50:28.698
Is this happening?

01:50:29.114 --> 01:50:32.003
Who was that girl
I saw you with at the hotel?

01:50:38.275 --> 01:50:39.519
Just a girl.

01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:41.565
A woman.

01:50:43.582 --> 01:50:44.856
Why you smiling?

01:50:45.471 --> 01:50:46.722
I don't know.

01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:51.310
Wow.

01:50:51.369 --> 01:50:53.612
I don't have to tell you
that kind of thing.

01:50:55.925 --> 01:50:58.667
Oh, I didn't realize there
was something not to tell.

01:51:05.255 --> 01:51:07.065
She was your girlfriend?

01:51:13.637 --> 01:51:14.769
Mm-hmm.

01:51:17.418 --> 01:51:18.769
What happened?

01:51:20.858 --> 01:51:22.315
I went out with her,

01:51:23.034 --> 01:51:24.948
and I never called her again.

01:51:29.336 --> 01:51:30.831
Did you love her?

01:51:32.744 --> 01:51:34.784
I didn't realize it at the time.

01:51:37.582 --> 01:51:38.987
Mm-hmm.

01:51:39.128 --> 01:51:40.217
Don't smile.

01:51:40.852 --> 01:51:42.104
Well...

01:51:44.022 --> 01:51:45.870
- You ready?
- Okay.

01:51:54.365 --> 01:51:56.347
You gotta try harder than that.

01:51:57.602 --> 01:51:59.925
I wish I could
take back every wound.

01:52:00.031 --> 01:52:01.792
Guess that blue bug is back.

01:52:03.147 --> 01:52:04.683
Every doubt.

01:52:21.214 --> 01:52:22.722
You found me.

01:52:37.845 --> 01:52:39.737
You held out your hand.

01:53:04.128 --> 01:53:05.503
I took sex.

01:53:08.576 --> 01:53:09.901
A gift.

01:53:14.856 --> 01:53:16.323
I played with it.

01:53:24.896 --> 01:53:27.308
I played with the flame of life.

01:53:39.755 --> 01:53:41.483
I was married in 1980,

01:53:41.638 --> 01:53:43.736
and I've been a widow since...

01:53:44.509 --> 01:53:46.615
1994, but...

01:53:47.011 --> 01:53:50.686
I still wear my ring
'cause he's still my husband.

01:53:50.817 --> 01:53:53.060
You know, we didn't get divorced, so...

01:53:53.333 --> 01:53:55.794
This is... this is my wedding ring,

01:53:56.087 --> 01:53:59.279
and this I bought
for myself after he died.

01:53:59.724 --> 01:54:03.107
It's what they gave runners
who didn't win a marathon

01:54:03.193 --> 01:54:04.880
but finished the race.

01:54:05.396 --> 01:54:07.641
Be an artist.
I never thought I would live long.

01:54:07.763 --> 01:54:11.677
You know, I'd be an artist and die
young of tuberculosis or something

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:12.980
like Charlotte Bronté, but, uh...

01:54:13.004 --> 01:54:14.604
What bad thing did you do?

01:54:15.413 --> 01:54:16.622
Just...

01:54:16.756 --> 01:54:18.333
got involved with...

01:54:19.344 --> 01:54:21.722
this man who I thought
could help me and...

01:54:21.818 --> 01:54:25.124
You made a mistake, you know?
Do you look at it...

01:54:25.286 --> 01:54:26.740
You'll do fine.

01:54:28.799 --> 01:54:30.107
I love you.

01:54:30.834 --> 01:54:32.341
Thank you.

01:54:34.748 --> 01:54:36.130
Is that your fella?

01:54:37.783 --> 01:54:39.247
Fight for him.

01:54:40.685 --> 01:54:42.042
If you really love him...

01:54:42.146 --> 01:54:43.544
don't let him get away.
