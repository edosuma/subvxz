00:11.344 --> 00:13.212
         - So how was your night
                     last night?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.747
            Do anything special?

00:14.749 --> 00:17.016
- [laughs]

00:18.752 --> 00:20.753
Yeah, it was amazing.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.422
           - It was?
           - [laughs]

00:26.092 --> 00:29.595
So, I mean,
what do we do now?

00:29.597 --> 00:33.465
          - How about we keep it
                      undefined?

00:33.467 --> 00:36.735
            For now.
            - Okay.

00:44.778 --> 00:48.180
Hey, as long as
you come over tonight, okay?

00:48.182 --> 00:52.484
        - Uh, what time?
           - [laughs]

00:52.486 --> 00:57.056

02:18.905 --> 02:20.806
       - How many shots?
      - Four? Maybe five.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.674
and then Roman,
he screams at me to go.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.143
        - He said that?
             - Yes.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.878
So I chased that little prick
to that corner,

02:25.880 --> 02:27.279
he fires at me
two more times.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.680
I tell him to stop

02:28.682 --> 02:31.250
and then he turns,
looks over his shoulder,

02:31.252 --> 02:33.218
something silver
in his hand, so I fired.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.620
         - You kept sight on him
                 the whole time?

02:34.622 --> 02:36.622
- No, not when he
rounded the corner.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.626
But I only had my eye off him
for a few seconds,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.227
it's the same kid.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.929
         - You get a look at him
       as he approached the car?

02:43.931 --> 02:46.832
- Maybe a glimpse.
Mostly just arm and torso,

02:46.834 --> 02:48.367
gun and muzzle flashes.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.402
Silver gun,
it looked like a .9.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.337
- Did you see where the asswipe
       tossed the piece?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.940
            - What?
        - Can't find it.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.781
        - You all right?
      - Yes. How is Sean?

03:02.783 --> 03:04.516
   - He lost a lot of blood.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.452
       - Marine Unit is en route
                to find the gun.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.221
      - You hit him twice
       from 40 yards away

03:09.223 --> 03:11.423
         in low light?
           Nice job.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.730
                          - Kim.
                 Kim, come here.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.566
                  You got to put
           a statement together.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.900
           Okay? List everything
                  that happened.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.902
                  Be definitive.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.804
              Keep your feelings
                      out of it.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.974
              Everything you say
        will be carved in stone.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.777
- I want to get to Med.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.845

          - All right.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.793
Dr. Choi,
you're going to Baghdad.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.461

    - Talk to me, incoming!

03:49.463 --> 03:50.929
   - 27-year-old police officer.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.233
Gunshot wound to the right neck,
       left back, arm, and hand.

              GCS 15, BPs 94/60.
                Heart rates 122.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.404
      - All right, rotate.
    We're going to Trauma 2.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.973
  - No, no, he goes with Choi!
   - Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:00.975 --> 04:04.643
      - He goes with Choi!
     [overlapping shouting]

04:04.645 --> 04:06.912
      - Everyone shut up!
       - Maggie, come on!

04:06.914 --> 04:09.348
- Go into Trauma 2!

04:09.350 --> 04:11.583
- Everybody block out the noise.
              Let's get to work.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.753
   - And every police officer
clear into the waiting room now!

04:14.755 --> 04:18.357
             Move!
          Move! Move!

04:18.358 --> 04:20.993
       Get out of my ER!

04:20.995 --> 04:24.463
- Michael Vance Ellis.
17. No priors.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.764
Father, John Ellis,
is a plumber,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.666
mother, Cecily Ellis,
works at a bank.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.402
We're running their address for
any historical in-service calls.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.638

     are both in surgery at Med.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.606
       Ellis' parents are there.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.408
- You got surveillance footage?
            - Yeah.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.344
I'm uploading the POD
footage right here.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.390
          <i>[somber music]</i>

04:51.392 --> 04:54.660
         - It's unreal.
   - Just like Philadelphia.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.895
          - That your statement?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.797
            - Yeah.
           - Come on.

      All right, you're gonna go

       I'm gonna close the door,

05:02.436 --> 05:04.636
                  and I need you
               to memorize this.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.738
Every word.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.544
              - Marine Unit says
                     no gun yet.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.813
           - [sighs]
            - Great.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.849
- Assistant State's
Attorney is downstairs.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.384
                 - Who'd we get?

05:19.386 --> 05:20.986
- Peter Stone.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.063
     - What was that about?

05:31.065 --> 05:33.999
               - Stone's the guy
         who sent him to prison.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.909
            - Peter.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.011
            - Hank.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.515
    Officer Roman's in ICU?
        - That's right.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.918
- And Officer Burgess?
How's she holding up?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.020
   - As well as can be expected.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.457
- What kind of a cop is she?

05:59.992 --> 06:02.794
                       - A plus.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.363
- I'm gonna need
the General Progress Reports

06:04.365 --> 06:06.365
from the incident--
plus any CRs on both

06:06.367 --> 06:07.866
Officers Roman and Burgess.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.001
  - They're active cops, they're
   gonna have complaint reports.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.972
We have 42 hours to either
charge or release Mr. Ellis.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.074
              - Yeah, I'm aware.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.810
               Feed you the info
                    as I get it.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.612
- I appreciate that,
but because of the profile

06:20.614 --> 06:22.013
of the incident,
we'll be doing

06:22.015 --> 06:24.683
a parallel and
independent investigation.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.819
My people are already
talking to the victim.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.422
        - This is a clean shoot,
                          Peter.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.823
- I sure hope so.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.925
You get me
those reports ASAP.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.841
I'm Detective Halstead,
this is Detective Lindsay.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.977
        - They're saying
    Michael shot the police.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.445
- Yeah, he did.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.080
         - That couldn't happen.
               It just couldn't.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.948
        - That's what we're here
                  to figure out.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.750
                   Does your son
           have access to a gun?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.119
- No! No knife,
no gun, no nothing.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.854
Not in my house.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.489
- You have to believe us.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.192
Michael doesn't have
a mean bone in his body.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.996
He's a Chicago Scholar.
He's on the Honor Roll.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.433
        - There's no way
     he could've done this.

07:14.435 --> 07:18.170
- My son didn't do this!
[crying]

07:19.772 --> 07:22.607
          [whispering]
       He didn't do this.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.722
                       - [gasps]

07:38.658 --> 07:40.759
- It's okay.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.200
          - I'm sorry.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.204
        - I'm all over the news.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.639
- Yeah, I know.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.813
Kim...

08:04.517 --> 08:07.619
I know you and I ended
pretty rough,

08:07.621 --> 08:11.590
but, hey...

08:11.592 --> 08:13.959
I still care about you
a lot

08:13.961 --> 08:15.560
and...

08:15.562 --> 08:18.163
if you need anything
at all...

08:19.565 --> 08:22.234
I'm here.
I got your back.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.641
Okay?

08:37.549 --> 08:39.650
        - Tell us what happened,
                        Michael.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.554
- This guy ran around a corner.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.524
 Fired a gun a couple of times
        then ducked off

08:45.526 --> 08:48.793
        into a building
     like 20 feet from me.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.096
        I started to run
  'cause this kid was shooting

08:51.098 --> 08:54.766
       and I didn't know
       what was going on.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.935
Next thing I know,

08:56.937 --> 08:58.003
I hear this
woman's voice yelling

08:58.005 --> 09:01.106
so I turned and ran.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.543
       Then it felt like
I got punched hard in the back.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.681
     That's all I remember.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.022
      Now they telling me
   I might never walk again.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.156
- [whispers]
Oh, God.

09:18.158 --> 09:21.259
[crying]
My baby.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.867
                      - Michael,
             did you have a gun?

09:28.869 --> 09:30.201
             - No.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.203
- What were you doing
down by the water?

09:32.205 --> 09:35.240
  This girl I've been seeing,
     she broke up with me.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.516
     - Thank you very much.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.185
           Shambala.
            - Peter.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.821
          - How's Ted?
  - He's retiring next month.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.923
        - That's great!
   - [chuckles] No, it's not.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.659
I want that man working.
I am not going down

19:21.661 --> 19:23.761
to a one-income family.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.863
         - That Cartier you wear
             tells me otherwise.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.365
- It's a fake,
don't tell anyone.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.667
         - Yeah, right.
  - So what's the offer, huh?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.503
Whenever you have an offer
you meet me at this roach coach.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.773
           of the unluckiest man
                   in the world?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.909
        It's a story about a kid
          who poses on Instagram

19:37.911 --> 19:39.510
          with a silver Beretta,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.512
        who wears the exact same
       clothes as a cop shooter,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.748
   and then gets caught on video

19:43.750 --> 19:45.283
                tossing said gun
                 into the river.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.653
- [chuckles]
Do you read the papers?

19:48.655 --> 19:51.455
We all love Michael.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.791
            - He loses at trial,
                he could get 80.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.493
- That kid
is not getting convicted

19:55.495 --> 19:57.228
by a jury in this city.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.564
Maybe two years ago.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.332
Not today.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.238
    - Why are we no further
           on motive?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.507
    Ellis told his co-worker
     he had it out for cops

20:09.509 --> 20:13.444
      - And don't tell me
  the state only has to prove

20:13.446 --> 20:14.946
    the act not the reason.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.615
I've never seen one jury
come back guilty

20:17.617 --> 20:19.417
when we don't show motive.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.785
People want to know why.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.787
It's got to make sense.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.756
Kid doesn't shoot into a cop car
    just for the hell of it.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.258

20:27.260 --> 20:28.859
- Enhanced POD video
is finally back.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.962
            - And please tell me
         we can see Ellis' face.

20:30.964 --> 20:33.264
          - Not quite.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.568

been screwing your partner?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.529
   with someone attacking us.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.864
         - Allow me to
      answer that question

21:06.866 --> 21:08.933
       as Ms. Green will.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.735
When you shot Michael Ellis,
were you thinking

21:10.737 --> 21:12.036
with your head
or your crotch?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.272
           - [shouts]
       We were fired on!

21:14.274 --> 21:15.773
             <i>We</i> were!

21:16.808 --> 21:18.876
- Officer Burgess...

21:18.878 --> 21:20.778
I am devoting a lot
of our resources

21:20.780 --> 21:24.482
to essentially defend <i>you.</i>

21:24.484 --> 21:27.518
Which I am ready to do...

21:27.520 --> 21:29.053
But I need to know...

21:29.055 --> 21:31.389
are there anymore
trap doors out there

21:31.391 --> 21:33.491
        waiting for us?
             - No.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.694
     I reacted as I was trained.

               <i>â™ª </i>

21:43.369 --> 21:45.469

22:17.537 --> 22:19.670
       [crowd dies down]

22:19.672 --> 22:23.441
I know this is an emotional time
         for all of us.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.844
    But this court must have
       a level of decorum

22:26.846 --> 22:28.946
   and respect for all sides.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.650
       Please be seated.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.689
          - Mr. Royal,
     would you please state

22:38.691 --> 22:42.793
- I'm a firearms examiner
for the Illinois State Police.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.061
              - Do you recognize
                    this weapon?

22:44.063 --> 22:46.964
- Yes, it's a stainless steel
Beretta 92.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.499
                   - And you did
          the ballistics testing

22:48.501 --> 22:51.001
                    on this gun,
            People's exhibit 10?

22:51.003 --> 22:52.803
- I did.
The fired evidence

22:52.805 --> 22:55.072
from the crime scene
came from this gun.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.041
                  - So this gun,
             found in the river,

22:57.043 --> 23:00.745
        is the same gun
    that shot Officer Roman?

23:00.747 --> 23:02.980
           - Correct.
             - Hmm.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.419
       Can you determine
        from this photo,

23:08.421 --> 23:09.820
      People's exhibit 11,

23:09.822 --> 23:12.390
             the make of the gun
  Michael Ellis is holding here?

23:12.392 --> 23:15.025
- That is stainless steel
Beretta 92.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.796
      - A stainless steel
          Beretta 92.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.067
No more questions.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.935
    - As you sit here today,
           Mr. Royal,

23:24.937 --> 23:27.772
        can you testify
         that you know

23:27.774 --> 23:31.075
     that the gun Mr. Ellis
is indeed holding in this photo

23:31.077 --> 23:33.577
                 is the same gun
                   that was used

23:33.579 --> 23:36.147
         in the crime?
        - No, I cannot.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.183
         - No further questions.

23:42.454 --> 23:45.656
- I found the gun in, probably,
a foot of silt right there.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.057
                       - Mm-hmm.
             Parallel from where

23:47.059 --> 23:48.993
              Michael Ellis fell
                in this diagram,

23:48.995 --> 23:51.962
      People's exhibit 23?
             - Yes.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.765
- And how far out from the shore
     did you find the gun?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.467
        - About 20 feet?
      - Throwing distance?

23:56.469 --> 23:57.868
          - Objection.
          - Sustained.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.703
    - No further questions.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.808
- You testified earlier
that you had the camera

24:03.810 --> 24:06.210
      installed because your car
           had been broken into?

24:06.212 --> 24:07.545
        - That's right.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.846
                 - Did you catch
               the perpetrators?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.181
- Chicago PD did, yes.

24:10.183 --> 24:11.816
         - The two men who broke
                  into your car,

24:11.818 --> 24:14.652
     they were African-American,
                        correct?

24:14.654 --> 24:16.687
          - Objection.
   Irrelevant and immaterial.

24:16.689 --> 24:17.822
          - Sustained.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.090
           Mr. Cade,
  what do you do for a living?

24:20.092 --> 24:21.692
- I'm a graphic designer.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.695
          - So you create images
               in your computer?

24:24.697 --> 24:26.764
             - Yes.
  - You also manipulate images

24:26.766 --> 24:29.133
         in a computer?
     - [chuckles] I guess.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.002
     - Have you ever manipulated
            video in a computer?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.804
     - Well, not this one.
 - That's not what I asked you.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.973
   Have you ever manipulated

24:35.975 --> 24:40.177
      video in a computer?
             - Yes.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.481
        - Okay, I'd like
 to direct your attention to--

24:43.483 --> 24:45.983
    to the monitor, please.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.720
       Is this the video
caught by your security camera?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.822
             - Yes.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.695
     Wait, there's no gun!
          - Objection,

24:57.697 --> 24:59.096
  that's not the video entered
         into evidence.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.698
          - Sustained.
 - That's because it's a fake.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.567
I had a graphic designer
remove the silver flash

25:03.569 --> 25:05.803
     just to prove how easy
   it is to manipulate video.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.204
   It took less than an hour.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.640
 - This is completely improper
       and she knows it.

25:09.642 --> 25:13.110
- Ms. Green, not only am I
gonna sustain the objection,

25:13.112 --> 25:14.712
but I'm also going to
instruct the jury

25:14.714 --> 25:17.248
to ignore what they've just seen
as it's a violation

25:17.250 --> 25:19.617
of the rules of evidence.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.719
                  - My apologies
                   to the court.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.821
           No further questions.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.694
                    - Find a way
              to shut this down.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.263
- If we do that, we might
as well shut down the office.

25:32.265 --> 25:35.232
You can't shoot the police
and we know he's the shooter.

25:35.234 --> 25:38.135
              - Beyond Chicago's
               reasonable doubt?

25:39.170 --> 25:41.171
           - [sighs]

25:41.173 --> 25:43.173
                - You do realize

25:43.175 --> 25:46.577
              that I'm the black
State's Attorney of Cook County?

25:46.579 --> 25:49.246
            - I do.
- And that as a public employee

25:49.248 --> 25:51.715
                if Michael Ellis
                   is acquitted,

25:51.717 --> 25:53.584
             you come in to work
               the next morning,

25:53.586 --> 25:56.253
               start a new case,
   while I, an elected official,

25:56.255 --> 25:59.189
          am voted out of office
                  come November.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.962
     - I'm not gonna lose.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.966
            - Don't.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.150
- And why did you receive,
say, this one?

27:34.753 --> 27:36.120
- My partner and I
rescued a young boy

27:36.122 --> 27:38.756
from where he was imprisoned
in his basement.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.858

     I took a shotgun blast

- Shot in the line of duty
and you came back to work

27:53.172 --> 27:55.305
    and went back on patrol?
             - Yes.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.675

27:57.677 --> 27:59.943
    On the side of our squad

   shot five bullets through?

28:05.284 --> 28:07.751
          - Objection.
          - Sustained.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.086
- No further questions.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.934
      - Officer Burgess...

28:25.437 --> 28:27.938
How long have you
and your partner, Sean Roman,

28:27.940 --> 28:30.307
been in
a sexual relationship?

28:36.748 --> 28:39.016
       - Officer Roman and I had
   just begun to see each other.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.285
- Just who were you
"serving and protecting"

28:41.287 --> 28:45.789
when you were
stroking your partner's neck?

28:45.791 --> 28:48.158
Would you say that your...

28:48.160 --> 28:50.394
intimate relationship
with Officer Roman

28:50.396 --> 28:52.362
     clouded your judgment?
             - No.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.864
- Would you say that your
intimate relationship

28:53.866 --> 28:56.333
with Officer Roman
caused you to panic

28:56.335 --> 28:57.935
       after he was shot?
             - No.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.169
- Would you say that your
intimate relationship

28:59.171 --> 29:01.138
with Officer Roman
caused you to shoot

29:01.140 --> 29:03.240
the first black man
you came across?

29:03.242 --> 29:06.009
        Nearly unloading
         your weapon...

29:06.011 --> 29:07.745
          - Objection!
       - Into his back--

29:07.747 --> 29:09.179
- Badgering, inflammatory,
and counsel is testifying!

29:09.181 --> 29:12.116
          - Sustained.
  - I'll restate, Your Honor.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.084
Ms. Burgess,

29:14.086 --> 29:16.186
what was the man who shot
your lover wearing

29:16.188 --> 29:18.122
    when you first saw him?
          - Objection.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.923
   Improper characterization.
          - Sustained.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.226
- Apologies.
What was the man who shot

29:22.228 --> 29:24.428
your partner wearing?

29:24.430 --> 29:27.164
                - A dark hoodie,
        jeans, white Nike shoes.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.398
- The same ones that are worn

29:28.400 --> 29:32.269
by 15,000 urban youth
in Chicago.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.937
    - Yes, because they wear
        the same clothes

29:33.939 --> 29:35.873
  to make it harder for police
       to identify them.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.975
- Hard to identify?

29:45.049 --> 29:47.050
     No further questions.

29:47.052 --> 29:50.053
         <i>[dramatic music]</i>

29:50.055 --> 29:58.162
               <i>â™ª </i>

30:02.133 --> 30:03.967
          - That video kicked us
              in the balls, huh?

30:03.969 --> 30:06.069
- Yeah,
dirty pool.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.273
                   - We're gonna
          get through it, right?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.914
- So where are you
on all this?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.215
                       - [sighs]

30:19.417 --> 30:22.886
                     I was black
     before I put this badge on.

30:22.888 --> 30:24.988
                   I'll be black
            after I take it off.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.459
         Bottom line is that kid
             shot at my friends.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.497
     Might as well have shot me.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.904
- But why did he?

30:40.906 --> 30:42.306
     I can put him at the scene.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.574
   I can put the gun in his hand

30:43.576 --> 30:46.243
              and that's enough,
      but I still don't get why.

30:49.147 --> 30:52.482
    'Cause I look in Ellis' eyes
   and I see what the jury sees:

30:52.484 --> 30:55.052
                  someone's son.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.154
    Not an attempted cop killer.

31:02.393 --> 31:03.994
                     What is it?

31:03.996 --> 31:06.096
        - I think we got motive.

31:08.266 --> 31:09.399
   - Location of the incident

31:09.401 --> 31:11.435
       is five miles away
       from Ellis' house.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.070
     If he liked walking by
   the river or lake so much,

31:13.072 --> 31:16.540
 The south branch is less than
  four blocks from his house.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.342
Ellis had a wallet
the night he was shot

31:18.344 --> 31:20.611
          which was inventoried.
     Inside there was a CTA pass

31:20.613 --> 31:22.312
which he didn't use
the night of the shooting,

31:22.314 --> 31:24.248
so we couldn't build
a time line of where he was

31:24.250 --> 31:26.049
     prior to the incident.
   - Then we ran his CTA card

31:26.051 --> 31:27.918
for historical information.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.887
Lo and behold Ellis visited
that same location

31:29.889 --> 31:32.322
    of the shooting 16 times
   over the last four years.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.391
- So we ran everyone
that was arrested in the area

31:34.393 --> 31:38.462
    - Could you just tell us
    what you found, please?

31:38.464 --> 31:41.365
        - Dewan Motley.
     - Who's Dewan Motley?

31:41.367 --> 31:44.067
            - May I?

31:44.069 --> 31:45.969
      He was a live-in boyfriend

31:45.971 --> 31:48.005
         of one of Ellis' aunts.

31:50.041 --> 31:53.577
Basically, a whole lot went down
            between Dewan Motley

31:53.579 --> 31:57.281
          and the CPD
  at this exact same location

31:57.283 --> 32:00.083
         six years ago.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.119
   I'll keep digging around.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.520
         See if anyone
       close to Motley--

32:03.522 --> 32:04.988
                       - No, no.
          Thanks for coming down

32:04.990 --> 32:07.424
                and briefing us.
   Intelligence has to stay away

32:07.426 --> 32:08.692
         at this point.
         - How's that?

32:08.694 --> 32:10.394
               - Green's running
      a reasonable doubt defense

32:10.396 --> 32:11.995
         and she's gonna bury us
                  if we give her

32:11.997 --> 32:14.097
  anymore conflicts of interest.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.368
- You gonna be able
to close on this, kid?

32:19.604 --> 32:21.505
              - I think you know
             I'm able, Sergeant.

32:22.573 --> 32:25.575
- Except when you
put me away

32:25.577 --> 32:28.111
you had this, kind of,
world-beater look in your eye.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.546
I'm not seeing it
right now, Peter.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.582
- That's because the case on you
                was a slam dunk.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.991
- That look.

32:44.095 --> 32:47.197
 [crowd chanting indistinctly]

32:49.701 --> 32:52.703
         <i>[dramatic music]</i>

               <i>â™ª </i>

33:32.543 --> 33:34.177
- Sergeant Voight
isn't here.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.279
          - I actually came here
                 to talk to you.

33:37.548 --> 33:38.749
- Back here.

33:38.751 --> 33:41.018
- Dewan Motley
from six years ago.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.486
You were the desk sergeant
on duty that night.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.254
            - I was?
    - The arresting officer,

33:44.256 --> 33:47.090
                     Ed Braymer,
    what kind of officer was he?

33:47.092 --> 33:50.160
- Old-school.
Very old-school.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.764
Not my kind of cop,
to be honest.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.435
                       - Racist?

33:58.437 --> 34:00.570
                 Off the record.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.141
- Yeah, he was.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.511
Does this have to do
with Michael Ellis?

34:07.513 --> 34:08.645
                        - Maybe.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.081
- It doesn't change
the facts of the case.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.750
     - I'm not talking to you as
  a prosecutor right now, Trudy.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.186
    Nothing excuses what Michael
                 did that night.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.489
       But I think you helped me
                      figure out

34:19.491 --> 34:20.791
               what put that gun
                    in his hand.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.760
         <i>[dramatic music]</i>

34:23.762 --> 34:27.063
               <i>â™ª </i>

34:27.065 --> 34:37.139
 - Defense calls Michael Ellis
         to the stand.

34:51.722 --> 34:55.092
           Michael...
       do you own a gun?

34:55.094 --> 34:56.626
          - No, ma'am.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.228
- Then why did you post
a picture of yourself

34:58.230 --> 35:00.097
holding a gun?

35:00.099 --> 35:01.698
        - It was stupid.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.800
       - Please tell us.

35:07.171 --> 35:08.538
- I was dating Penny

35:08.540 --> 35:11.741
and I got it stuck in my head

35:11.743 --> 35:13.610
    that she wanted someone,
          you know...

35:13.612 --> 35:16.246
            tougher.

35:16.248 --> 35:19.449
 In fact, I'd seen her talking
to some guys who were in gangs.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.252
      I was at this party
 and this older guy had a gun.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.521
     He was showing it off.
      So I was like, "Yo,

35:24.523 --> 35:26.356
    "let me take a photo to,
           you know,

35:26.358 --> 35:30.327
   try to impress this girl."

35:30.329 --> 35:33.630
    That gun was in my hands
    for, like, ten seconds.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.499
          That was it.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.634
        I gave it back.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.736
  I've never even shot a gun.

35:41.772 --> 35:43.840
         - No further questions.

35:50.681 --> 35:53.416
- Who's Dewan Motley?

36:06.230 --> 36:07.764
          - My uncle.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.300
          Well, he's--
   he's not really my uncle.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.536
    - The longtime boyfriend
     of your aunt, correct?

36:13.571 --> 36:15.372
             - Yes.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.607
            - Tell us about him.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.609
- He was a good man.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.611
                    - Is it true
   he was arrested six years ago

36:21.613 --> 36:23.380
     for drunk and disorderly...

36:23.382 --> 36:24.681
             and while resisting
                    that arrest,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.816
 he caught the arresting officer
                    off balance,

36:26.818 --> 36:29.653
         hit him, and caused him
                to hit his head?

36:29.655 --> 36:31.188
                Put that officer
                      in a coma?

36:31.190 --> 36:32.322
    - Objection, Your Honor.
  - And it doesn't look like--

36:32.324 --> 36:33.857
          - Overruled.
     - It doesn't look like

36:33.859 --> 36:36.259
        he's gonna wake up ever.

36:38.596 --> 36:39.729
        Is that correct?

36:39.731 --> 36:42.499
         - Dewan wasn't
     doing anything wrong.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.934
               - Do you remember
  where the incident took place?

36:43.936 --> 36:46.436
  Where your uncle was arrested?

36:46.438 --> 36:47.871
             - No.
   - It was the same street--

36:47.873 --> 36:49.639
                  same corner...

36:49.641 --> 36:51.474
             where Officer Roman
                       was shot.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.644
            - Okay.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.712
      - Did you visit your uncle
                        in jail?

36:55.714 --> 36:56.846
             - Yes.
       - How many times?

36:56.848 --> 36:58.315
        - I don't know.
             - 12.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.816
     - Sidebar, Your Honor.

37:02.286 --> 37:03.687
State never disclosed this.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.355
This is a classic
Brady violation.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.957
- It's newly discovered evidence
             and not exculpatory

37:06.959 --> 37:08.858
so it's not Brady
and how can I disclose something

37:08.860 --> 37:09.993
when I don't even know
they're going to call

37:09.995 --> 37:13.897
- All evidence incriminating
defendant is prejudicial.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.599
Since when is motive
not relevant?

37:15.601 --> 37:18.301
   - This is a collateral issue.
                     No bearing.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.638
  - This is cross examination

37:21.640 --> 37:24.541
      and not exculpatory,
           Counselor.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.244
         I'll allow it.
      Objection overruled.

37:27.246 --> 37:30.680
  - How did Dewan Motley die,
            Michael?

37:30.682 --> 37:32.515
       - He hung himself
           in prison.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.251
         - After his last appeal
                     was denied.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.485
           - I guess.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.687
   - How did that make you feel?

37:37.689 --> 37:39.689
      - How do you think?

37:39.691 --> 37:42.325
               - I'm asking you.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.830
         - I was angry.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.298
       You would be too.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.567
       - When did he die?
    - I don't know for sure.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.002
                - I'll tell you.

37:52.004 --> 37:54.004
          It was the day <i>before </i>

37:54.006 --> 37:55.739
         Officer Roman was shot.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.976
            Michael, look at me.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.279
                      Michael...

38:03.914 --> 38:05.448
                 your girlfriend
               broke up with you

38:05.450 --> 38:08.418
             because you weren't
                  "tough enough"

38:08.420 --> 38:11.755
                and your uncle--
 who's life was ruined by a cop,

38:11.757 --> 38:14.291
                 killed himself.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.660
       This all within two days,
                        correct?

38:19.063 --> 38:21.364
                 You didn't walk
               down to the river

38:21.366 --> 38:23.500
                over a break up.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.002
           You walked down there
                         armed--

38:26.004 --> 38:28.538
            to the same location
        your uncle was arrested,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.507
        to prove you were tough.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.842
                  To get revenge
                 for your uncle.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.511
    - Objection, Your Honor!
          - Sustained.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.680
      - Dewan just wanted
        an explanation!

38:38.916 --> 38:41.017
    It was that cop's fault
        that he's dead!

38:41.019 --> 38:43.019
             - And you went down
    to the river to get revenge,

38:43.021 --> 38:44.621
                     didn't you?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.856
   You went down there, Michael,
                to kill a cop...

38:46.858 --> 38:48.024
    - Objection, Your Honor!
            - Right?

38:48.026 --> 38:50.593
    - Counsel is testifying!
           - Enough!

39:23.494 --> 39:25.762
            - Peter.
          - Shambala.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.064
                 - Look at this.
        You got me eating carbs.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.467
- If it's any comfort,
I housed a whole pint

39:30.469 --> 39:32.869
of Haagen-Dazs last night.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.071
            - Aggravated battery
                 with a firearm.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.906
           Served as a juvenile.

39:38.743 --> 39:41.010
           - No way.
- I'm only gonna offer it once.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.580
- You ever had
an innocent client, Shambala?

39:46.917 --> 39:49.686
             - I've had hundreds
            who were not guilty.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.632
                           - No.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.501
- We should take it,
Peter.

40:04.503 --> 40:05.935
         - It's been three days.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.070
If the jury was going
to acquit,

40:07.072 --> 40:08.805
they'd be back already
and Green knows it.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.808
     - And you never seen a case
 go sideways at the last minute?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.943
- He could be out
in four years.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.578
    - And he would have admitted
                       his guilt

40:15.580 --> 40:17.747
          and this will be over.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.751
              Do you really want
                to put this city

40:21.753 --> 40:23.853
              through this again
              if the jury hangs?

40:30.828 --> 40:32.929
- Only if Burgess and Roman
sign off on it.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.843
       - Absolutely not.
           - [sighs]

40:48.813 --> 40:50.613
            - What? Do you think
             you should do this?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.584
      - I see it's merits.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.586
           - [sighs]

40:56.588 --> 40:58.588
     Then he needs to admit
     he lied in open court.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.990
    - It's <i>nolo contendere.</i>

41:00.992 --> 41:04.194
 He won't dispute the charges.
           That's it.

41:04.196 --> 41:06.629
- Can we at least
get an apology?

41:06.631 --> 41:09.098
          To the CPD?
    - It's not gonna happen.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.100
- So the next guy
that shoots a cop

41:11.102 --> 41:12.702
thinks all he'll get
is four years?

41:12.704 --> 41:13.870
                         - Sean,
            he may be acquitted.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.672
                 That's the risk
              we're taking here.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.774
               Or, almost worse,
           the jury may be hung.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.483
              - It's up to Sean.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.685
                    He's the one
                   who got shot.

41:34.024 --> 41:37.527
      - We're all sleeping
    in our own beds tonight.

41:37.529 --> 41:39.629
    Let the city sleep too.
