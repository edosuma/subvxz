(Somber music)

00:13.733 --> 00:18.733
(Thunder)
(Ominous music)

00:25.067 --> 00:27.600
[Voiceover] He's reaching
out, really, for the downtrodden

00:27.600 --> 00:30.933
Of society, for the average
Joe on the street who wants

00:30.933 --> 00:33.267
To look up to his lyrics
and his music and say,

00:33.267 --> 00:35.700
"Hey, this man's
talking my language."

00:43.533 --> 00:45.167
[Voiceover] You guys don't
like explaining anything

00:45.167 --> 00:46.433
To do with your music...

00:46.433 --> 00:47.367
[Voiceover] There's
nothing to be said,

00:47.367 --> 00:48.733
It's all in the music, man.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.200
It's all in the music.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.333
[Voiceover] If there was
a John Lennon-type figure

00:53.333 --> 00:56.333
For the so-called "Generation
X," it would be Cobain.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.467
[Voiceover] The body of
Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain

00:58.467 --> 01:00.767
Was found in a house in
Seattle on Friday morning,

01:00.767 --> 01:03.167
Dead of an apparently
self-inflicted shotgun blast

01:03.167 --> 01:04.667
To the head.

01:04.933 --> 01:07.533
[Voiceover] An electrician
hired to work on Cobain's home

01:07.533 --> 01:10.300
Walked up to this room
above Cobain's garage

01:10.300 --> 01:12.800
And made the shocking
discovery this morning.

01:13.267 --> 01:14.867
[Voiceover] A
suicide note was found.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.433
[Voiceover] This
is a puzzling case,

01:16.433 --> 01:18.433
A very disturbing case.

01:19.267 --> 01:22.133
[Voiceover] It first got
reported that Kurt was missing

01:22.133 --> 01:26.167
And Courtney Love hired
private investigator Tom Grant.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.100
[Voiceover] I had
been involved in

01:27.100 --> 01:29.300
Missing persons cases before.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.933
Some red flags started
popping up immediately,

01:31.933 --> 01:35.667
So I began recording every
conversation I had with Courtney

01:35.667 --> 01:38.333
During the entire period
that I worked for her.

01:38.767 --> 01:42.633
[Voiceover] My
name is (Indistinct)

01:42.633 --> 01:45.200
[Voiceover] It could be
made to look like a suicide.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.533
[Voiceover] People that
I had do this, I paid.

01:47.533 --> 01:49.067
[Voiceover] I've walked
into cases that looked

01:49.067 --> 01:51.200
Like they were suicides that
turned out to be homicides.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.767
[Voiceover] Cobain's
wife, singer Courtney Love,

01:52.767 --> 01:54.867
Was in England on tour
with her band Hole

01:54.867 --> 01:56.300
When the body was discovered.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.200
[Voiceover] As it is,
she has inherited an estate

01:58.200 --> 02:00.167
Worth tens of
millions of dollars.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.567
That's motive.

02:01.567 --> 02:02.933
[Voiceover] Did Courtney
Love kill Kurt Cobain?

02:02.933 --> 02:05.833
Did she have a hand in
any kind of conspiracy?

02:05.833 --> 02:10.800
These are favorite
topics of fanatics.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.633
[Voiceover] There's nothing
in the medical examiner's

02:13.633 --> 02:16.500
Report or coroner's reports
that could not have easily

02:16.500 --> 02:18.867
Have been duplicated
by a murderer.

02:18.867 --> 02:21.267
[Voiceover] It's entirely
possible that a police officer,

02:21.267 --> 02:24.967
No matter how well-trained,
may not see or notice

02:24.967 --> 02:27.133
A particular item of evidence.

02:27.133 --> 02:29.133
[Voiceover] Kurt
Cobain was not barricaded

02:29.133 --> 02:30.367
Inside the room.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.600
He did not leave his
driver's license out.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.800
No one would believe
that was a suicide note.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.933
Kurt Cobain was injected
with three times

02:36.933 --> 02:39.533
The lethal dose of heroin.

02:39.533 --> 02:41.500
The media was
getting this wrong.

02:43.933 --> 02:48.933

03:02.833 --> 03:07.833
(Ominous music)

03:28.167 --> 03:29.833
Are you sure
he's not in there?

03:32.700 --> 03:35.067
I knocked for at
least five minutes.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.467
If he's there he
would have answered.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.700
Alright, I just
don't wanna end up

03:39.700 --> 03:41.767
On the wrong end of a shotgun.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.133
Let's go.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.400
[Dylan] Careful.

04:22.733 --> 04:24.467
[Dylan] Kurt?

04:24.467 --> 04:26.067
Kurt!

04:55.867 --> 04:56.700
[Tom] If we find
it we're gonna have

04:56.700 --> 04:58.067
To take it, right?

04:58.633 --> 05:00.067
[Dylan] Yeah.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.367
Which I can legally
do since I bought it.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.067
It's in my name, so...

05:05.633 --> 05:07.500
[Tom] Not here, could
it be under the bed?

05:07.567 --> 05:08.700
[Dylan] Might be.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.433
[Tom] No. Alright,
let's move this.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.433
Alright, what is this?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.067
This mean anything to ya?

05:19.067 --> 05:20.900
[Dylan] Rohypnol,
that's where they are.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.067
[Tom] What?

05:22.067 --> 05:23.300
He kept saying
someone stole 'em,

05:23.300 --> 05:25.400
But they've been sitting there.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.533
These are what he
OD'ed on in Rome.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.200
[Tom] Well she didn't
want us to take those.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.367
Yeah.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.067
[Tom] Uh, wait a minute.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.400
Would she be okay
if you keep 'em?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.500
[Dylan] Yeah.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.200
Are they legal here?

05:43.200 --> 05:45.067
[Dylan] Yeah, they're
completely legal, they're like...

05:45.067 --> 05:46.467
[Tom] What are they used for?

05:46.467 --> 05:47.900
[Dylan] They're
sold as a sedative for

05:47.900 --> 05:50.533
Sleeping ailments, and sometimes
they're given to people...

05:50.533 --> 05:51.900
[Tom] And if we get
pulled over, you're not

05:51.900 --> 05:53.767
Gonna get arrested
for havin' those?

05:53.767 --> 05:55.600
[Dylan] No, they're fine.

05:57.967 --> 06:00.700
Well it's obviously
not here, the shotgun.

06:00.700 --> 06:04.100
No, and I dunno
where it would be.

06:12.533 --> 06:13.233
[Tom] Is there anywhere else?

06:13.233 --> 06:14.267
[Dylan] No.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.333
[Tom] Okay.

06:17.067 --> 06:22.067
(Ominous music)

08:21.167 --> 08:22.833
My name is Tom Grant.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.067
I was hired by Courtney
Love to find her missing

08:25.067 --> 08:29.067
Husband, Kurt Cobain,
in April of 1994.

08:32.167 --> 08:35.467
My father was a schoolteacher,

08:35.467 --> 08:39.133
And this is a man I
never caught one time

08:39.133 --> 08:41.533
In my entire life telling a lie.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.467
He was the best role
model anybody can ask for.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.800
By the time I became a
junior in high school,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.967
I definitely wanted to
be a police officer.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.067
Graduating from the L.A.
County Sheriff's Department

08:57.067 --> 09:01.067
Was a very proud day for
me and for my family.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.067
My first assignment
was a patrol division

09:04.067 --> 09:06.700
At West Hollywood
Sheriff Station.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.133
When I quit the department,
I quit in very high standing.

09:14.133 --> 09:15.967
From there I moved
on, took the test

09:15.967 --> 09:19.167
And obtained my own private
investigator's license.

09:26.133 --> 09:30.267
I believe what makes me a good
P.I. is that I always apply

09:30.267 --> 09:33.867
Logic and common sense
to everything that I do.

09:35.133 --> 09:38.933
I've seen a lot of
suicides, a lot of murders,

09:38.933 --> 09:42.067
And I don't try to
pre-determine anything.

09:43.533 --> 09:46.067
And if I feel that my
client, that's coming to me

09:46.067 --> 09:50.267
For help, is in the wrong based
on what they're telling me,

09:50.267 --> 09:52.600
I'll let them know,
"This could be a pretty"

09:52.600 --> 09:54.867
"Dangerous trip for you."

09:54.867 --> 09:57.733
Scratch the surface of most
P.I.s and you don't find a clean

09:57.733 --> 10:00.000
Record, you find
a lotta skeletons.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.600
And then we met Tom Grant.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.100
It turned out he had
an exemplary record.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.967
He was respected, he
was a stand-up guy.

10:06.967 --> 10:09.500
There was a consensus,
and that went a long way

10:09.500 --> 10:12.467
To convincing us
of his credibility.

10:12.467 --> 10:15.400
The word conspiracy is
actually a legal term.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.733
It simply means two or
more people plotting

10:18.733 --> 10:21.367
Or planning to commit a crime.

10:21.367 --> 10:24.467
Even committing shoplifting
with another person

10:24.467 --> 10:27.467
Can actually be charged
with conspiracy.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.500
When somebody refers to me
as a conspiracy theorist,

10:31.500 --> 10:35.133
I take it as an insult because
I know what they mean by it.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.833
Hiring me is not like
hiring an attorney.

10:38.833 --> 10:43.100
It's not to protect you, it's
not to keep you outta jail.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.500
My job as a private investigator
is to find the truth.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.633
It's simply to find
the truth in the matter

10:49.633 --> 10:51.967
That you're hiring me for.

10:54.900 --> 10:59.900
(Eerie music)

11:03.267 --> 11:06.367
On Easter Sunday,
I was in my office

11:06.367 --> 11:09.067
With a private investigator
who worked for me

11:09.067 --> 11:11.200
Named Ben Klugman,
and we were dealing

11:11.200 --> 11:14.167
With a client when
the phone rang.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.700
(Phone ringing)

11:15.700 --> 11:16.967
Now who calls on Easter?

11:16.967 --> 11:19.500
Would you excuse us
for just a second?

11:20.533 --> 11:22.400
The Grant Company,
how may I help you?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.867
[Tom] And it was a woman's
voice on the other end,

11:24.867 --> 11:26.700
Kind of a raspy, low voice.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.167
Now if someone is unlawfully
using your credit cards,

11:29.167 --> 11:31.667
Maybe the police are the
better people to call.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.233
[Tom] And then she said,
"My husband and I are"

11:34.233 --> 11:38.267
"Kinda famous, and we need
to get this done right away."

11:39.933 --> 11:41.233
And your husband's name?

11:41.233 --> 11:42.567
Are you kidding me?

11:42.567 --> 11:43.833
No, no.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.067
I was about 47 at
the time; Ben Klugman,

11:46.067 --> 11:48.133
My investigator, was 29.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.333
He immediately
knew who they were

11:50.333 --> 11:53.600
And what had been
going on, even in Rome

11:53.600 --> 11:55.233
Just a few weeks earlier.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.833
Because it was a holiday, of
course, there were very few,

11:57.833 --> 12:00.967
If any, other
private investigators
working, so she went

12:00.967 --> 12:03.233
Through the Yellow Pages
and she found our ad

12:03.233 --> 12:06.367
And I was probably one
of many that she called,

12:06.367 --> 12:07.833
And I think she was
probably surprised

12:07.833 --> 12:09.767
To have the phone picked up.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.300
What room number?

12:12.067 --> 12:15.067
It's not very often that
a private investigator goes

12:15.067 --> 12:18.933
Against his client, so I'm
sure she regrets hiring me.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.100
When we were available
to meet Courtney

12:24.100 --> 12:27.633
At the Peninsula Hotel,
first thing she said,

12:27.633 --> 12:30.100
And this is her words,
they're not mine,

12:32.933 --> 12:37.200
You leak this to the press,
I'll sue the fuck out of you.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.500
Well, hello to
you too. (Laughing)

12:41.500 --> 12:43.167
How ya doin'?

12:46.067 --> 12:48.133
Kurtis came from
rehab a couple days ago.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.833
He bought a ticket back to
Seattle, but nobody's seen him

12:49.833 --> 12:51.267
Since he got back.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.267
When I first entered
the room, she was wearing

12:53.267 --> 12:58.067
A negligee nightgown,
totally see-through.

12:58.067 --> 13:01.700
She might as well have
had nothing on whatsoever.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.267
[Courtney] I called
the credit card companies

13:05.267 --> 13:07.333
And told them that
the card was stolen

13:07.333 --> 13:09.067
And that they should cancel it.

13:11.233 --> 13:12.333
[Tom] Was it?

13:12.900 --> 13:14.067
[Courtney] What?

13:15.067 --> 13:16.533
[Tom] Stolen.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.067
[Courtney] No.

13:18.567 --> 13:21.400
Courtney eventually told
us that Kurt's credit card

13:21.400 --> 13:24.067
Actually wasn't stolen,
that she had called the

13:24.067 --> 13:27.633
Credit card company and
canceled it so that nobody

13:27.633 --> 13:29.067
Could use it.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.600
She felt that that would,
essentially, cut him off

13:31.600 --> 13:33.800
From any funds.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.433
I'm sure your husband has
another way of getting money.

13:36.433 --> 13:37.800
[Courtney] Are you kidding me?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.700
Kurt is helpless, he
doesn't have any friends.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.300
Again, in her words,
"You don't understand."

13:42.300 --> 13:43.567
"This guy can't even catch a..."

13:43.567 --> 13:46.100
Fucking cab by
himself if he wanted to!

13:46.833 --> 13:47.600
[Woman] Hey.

13:47.600 --> 13:48.800
[Courtney] Hey.

13:56.933 --> 13:58.600
That's my drug dealer.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.300
I didn't know at the
time that this was supposed

14:02.300 --> 14:04.933
To be an in-house rehab.

14:04.933 --> 14:08.667
I learned that later,
but a total farce.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.800
Most of the time I was
with her, she was either

14:10.800 --> 14:13.667
On drugs or doing drugs.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.333
There was nobody overseeing
what was going on there.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.600
[Courtney] Listen,
Kurt escaped from rehab,

14:18.600 --> 14:21.367
He bought a shotgun, and I
just feel like something bad

14:21.367 --> 14:22.900
Is gonna happen, okay?

14:22.900 --> 14:25.533
In the middle of all this
conversation, she keeps talking

14:25.533 --> 14:28.100
About how suicidal he is,
and how everybody thinks

14:28.100 --> 14:29.800
He's gonna commit suicide.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.867
[Courtney] Everybody
knows it, everybody thinks

14:30.867 --> 14:31.867
He's gonna die.

14:31.867 --> 14:33.067
Hold on a second.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.067
If he bought a shotgun
and he's suicidal,

14:35.067 --> 14:36.567
Then dealing with this
credit card problem,

14:36.567 --> 14:39.200
That's the least important
thing we could help you with.

14:39.867 --> 14:43.233
[Courtney] Okay, well that's
where I want you to start.

14:45.067 --> 14:47.867
She started off with a lie
when we first talked to her

14:47.867 --> 14:50.867
On the phone, saying why
she wanted to hire us,

14:50.867 --> 14:54.233
Which wasn't true, and
then she starts telling us

14:54.233 --> 14:56.267
These other things that
just didn't add up.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.733
They weren't logical,
they didn't make sense.

14:58.733 --> 15:01.733
So all kinds of red
flags started popping up.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.100
I dunno what's gonna
happen with this case,

15:03.100 --> 15:05.933
But we are gonna
document everything.

15:06.567 --> 15:09.067
Looking back on that day,
it turned out to be a day

15:09.067 --> 15:13.533
That really changed
my life forever.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.200
The name Kurt Cobain
goes through my mind,

15:16.200 --> 15:19.900
Probably three or 400
times a day, at least,

15:19.900 --> 15:24.100
And it has for the last
20 years, by necessity,

15:24.100 --> 15:26.633
Because of the e-mails I
get, the letters I get,

15:26.633 --> 15:29.933
And all the other stuff,
because he was so famous,

15:29.933 --> 15:33.900
And it gets a little
bit old after a while,

15:33.900 --> 15:36.067
Just thinking Kurt Cobain,
Kurt Cobain, Kurt Cobain.

15:36.067 --> 15:38.067
[Voiceover] Kurt Cobain,
Kurt Cobain, Kurt Cobain,

15:38.067 --> 15:39.833
Kurt Cobain, Kurt Cobain.

15:39.833 --> 15:44.833
(Rock music)

16:10.167 --> 16:15.133
(Rock music)

16:25.833 --> 16:27.433
Growing up in Aberdeen,

16:29.067 --> 16:31.400
Basically not a whole lot to do.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.567
Nine months out of the
year is very dreary,

16:33.567 --> 16:35.500
Very overcast, lotsa rain.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.567
It's kinda hard living in this
area and not being depressed.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.700
Employment
opportunities in Aberdeen,

16:41.700 --> 16:45.367
There's not a whole lot.

16:45.367 --> 16:48.300
For the most part, we
were lower-middle class.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.767
I don't think we would
be considered poor,

16:50.767 --> 16:52.400
We certainly didn't go hungry.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.133
The first two weeks of
the month, everybody gets

16:54.133 --> 16:56.533
Their welfare check,
the bars are packed.

16:56.533 --> 16:58.833
The last two weeks of the
month, the bars are empty

16:58.833 --> 17:02.900
And that's pretty much the
state of living. (Laughing)

17:02.900 --> 17:04.800
Kurt used to live
across the street,

17:04.800 --> 17:06.967
And his mother and him,
they'd sit out there and argue

17:06.967 --> 17:11.467
For a half hour or 45 minutes,
and the wife and I slept up

17:11.467 --> 17:15.200
In the upstairs bedroom, so
we used to hear it. (Laughing)

17:15.200 --> 17:19.067
I knew Kurt Cobain
from the high school.

17:19.067 --> 17:22.800
He ran around with
my two oldest sons.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.500
The couch I'm sitting
on now is the couch

17:25.500 --> 17:27.567
That Kurt slept on.

17:27.567 --> 17:32.567
He stayed for a few days,
and then a few days more,

17:32.967 --> 17:37.967
And it just sorta stretched
out to be about a year.

17:38.833 --> 17:42.700
It's a depressing
atmosphere, but I also think

17:42.700 --> 17:45.333
At the same time, that's
why we have so many bands

17:45.333 --> 17:47.100
From all over Washington State.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.333
There was nothing to do.

17:48.333 --> 17:52.067
It rained constantly, so
what you had to do was

17:52.067 --> 17:53.333
You had to improvise.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.300
People tended to pick
up instruments and play,

17:55.300 --> 17:57.067
And I think that just
affected the music

17:57.067 --> 17:58.767
For this whole
region in general.

17:58.767 --> 18:02.100
In our neighborhood,
we lived a block away

18:02.100 --> 18:05.433
From the group that
became the Melvins.

18:05.433 --> 18:09.367
Metal Church lived in
the house next door.

18:09.367 --> 18:12.400
We had examples of
people who made it.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.667
I used to see him with
his drum sticks beat

18:14.667 --> 18:18.133
On the stop signs, on the
fences, and his dad had

18:18.133 --> 18:21.933
A old Ford pickup, he used
to beat on that. (Laughing)

18:21.933 --> 18:25.067
When he first saw the Melvins
live for the first time,

18:25.067 --> 18:27.300
He just knew that that
was what he wanted to do.

18:27.300 --> 18:29.667
The day that changed his life.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.967
Before Nirvana, we
were called Skid Row,

18:32.967 --> 18:35.133
And then we went from Skid
Row and we played live

18:35.133 --> 18:37.700
On the radio, a
midnight show on Chaos.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.433
The very next day, I
showed up at Kurt's

18:40.433 --> 18:43.433
And Kurt had his easel
and he was paintin'

18:43.433 --> 18:46.333
This picture, and I
looked at it and I go,

18:46.333 --> 18:47.333
"What the hell?"

18:47.333 --> 18:50.267
It was a painting of a giant pen

18:50.267 --> 18:52.200
With its cap all chewed up.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.167
From that day on, we
were called Pencap Chew.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.700
We did some shows
as Pencap Chew,

18:56.700 --> 19:00.833
And Kurt tired of that,
so we're Ted Ed Fred.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.667
They don't like that no more,
so we're gonna be Bliss.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.167
The fourth name was Bliss,

19:06.167 --> 19:08.900
And then the fifth
name was Nirvana.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.933
I didn't see him
as being particularly

19:12.933 --> 19:15.633
Different emotionally
from any of us.

19:15.633 --> 19:17.567
I think people tended
to read him wrong,

19:17.567 --> 19:19.500
Just because he
was a quiet person.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.200
I don't see Kurt as
being depressed at all,

19:22.200 --> 19:24.067
I see him as being optimistic.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.367
He gave me a lotta hope,

19:26.367 --> 19:28.200
To hopefully, some day,
get outta this area

19:28.200 --> 19:30.067
With my music.

19:30.067 --> 19:33.233
Nirvana, Mudhoney and the
Melvins was doing something.

19:33.233 --> 19:34.667
It was proactive.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.667
To me, that takes courage,
and he had that courage,

19:38.667 --> 19:41.533
And that was the big difference.

19:41.533 --> 19:45.067
He had so much talent
and tremendous amount

19:45.067 --> 19:48.500
Of creativity to give,
so it's unlimited,

19:48.500 --> 19:50.133
What he could've done.

19:50.533 --> 19:53.567
It would be nice to,
eventually, start playing

19:53.567 --> 19:57.267
Acoustic guitars and be
thought of as a singer

19:57.267 --> 20:00.600
And a songwriter rather
than a grunge rocker.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.067
Because then I might be able
to take advantage of that

20:03.067 --> 20:05.600
When I'm older and
sit down on a chair

20:05.600 --> 20:09.567
And play acoustic guitar like
Johnny Cash or something,

20:10.467 --> 20:13.767
And it won't be a big
joke, but who knows?

20:15.100 --> 20:17.200
My last real memory of Kurt

20:17.200 --> 20:21.167
And it's not a good thing
for me, but I was on my way

20:21.167 --> 20:22.800
To work and I had to get gas.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.633
I stopped in at one
of my former employers

20:24.633 --> 20:27.667
And I was gettin' gas for
my car, and they actually

20:27.667 --> 20:29.333
Had the radio playing.

20:31.967 --> 20:33.700
They overheard it on
the radio and stuff,

20:33.700 --> 20:36.400
Standing, paying for my
gas, and it was like...

20:39.933 --> 20:41.867
I can't forget that day.

20:48.700 --> 20:53.700
(Eerie guitar music)

20:56.533 --> 20:57.533
[Courtney] I called
the credit card company

20:57.533 --> 21:00.933
Like you said, and

21:02.667 --> 21:04.067
They told me he also
bought two tickets

21:04.067 --> 21:05.333
On United Airlines.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.100
[Older man] Where to?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.600
They don't know, or
they won't tell me.

21:10.933 --> 21:13.233
All they told me was how
much he paid for 'em.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.300
So, I dunno.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.600
Maybe he's going to hang
out with Michael again.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.733
Michael.

21:22.733 --> 21:24.100
Stipe.

21:25.733 --> 21:27.867
Lead singer of R.E.M?

21:30.667 --> 21:35.500
Anyway, I figure he
flies up, gets his guitar

21:35.500 --> 21:37.500
From Seattle and then he
flies down to Atlanta,

21:37.500 --> 21:38.700
But he has two tickets.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.067
Did he buy a ticket
for someone else?

21:41.667 --> 21:46.467
(Crying)

21:46.467 --> 21:49.133
I think Kurt wants a divorce.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.800
Why would you say that?

21:50.800 --> 21:55.467
He left me a note in Rome,
he said he's leaving me.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.433
The subject of divorce
came up almost every time

21:58.433 --> 22:00.100
We talked after that.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.633
Whenever Courtney
referred to divorce,

22:02.633 --> 22:04.567
She would usually
say something like...

22:09.900 --> 22:11.367
The only way that a
divorce is gonna happen is

22:11.367 --> 22:13.800
If I bust him for infidelity.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.300
Has he been unfaithful?

22:15.300 --> 22:18.533
Yes! Yes, I think so.

22:18.533 --> 22:21.333
Courtney, on several
occasions, mentioned
that she thought

22:21.333 --> 22:24.533
Kurt might be having an
affair with Kristen Pfaff,

22:24.533 --> 22:25.967
Her bass player.

22:25.967 --> 22:28.967
She was very jealous, and
she also felt like he might

22:28.967 --> 22:31.067
Be having an affair
with Caitlin.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.333
His drug dealer.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.933
If Kurt's in Seattle,
he's with her.

22:34.933 --> 22:37.233
She seemed to be
very jealous of anybody

22:37.233 --> 22:40.200
That got near Kurt, and wanted
to know every little move

22:40.200 --> 22:42.133
That he made.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.967
So I planted a story
in the news yesterday,

22:50.967 --> 22:55.433
Saying that I had OD'ed and
that I was in the hospital,

22:55.433 --> 22:58.500
Thinking that Kurt would
get scared and call me.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.867
I dunno, it's like...

23:01.667 --> 23:04.933
I've got this record
coming out in a week,

23:05.667 --> 23:10.667
And so I know the value of this,
but I didn't think about it

23:11.167 --> 23:12.467
When it first happened, but

23:15.867 --> 23:18.800
(Laughing)

23:18.800 --> 23:22.267
Anyway, what do I tell this
guy from the Associated Press?

23:22.267 --> 23:26.067
Should I call and confirm it,
and so the story goes out,

23:26.067 --> 23:27.467
And say I was there?

23:27.467 --> 23:29.467
I tell you what, and this
is just my gut instinct

23:29.467 --> 23:30.667
Yeah.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.333
That way there's
no drugs involved

23:53.333 --> 23:55.067
And the sympathy goes to me.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.933
(Laughing) The press always
perceives me as just completely

24:01.933 --> 24:06.067
Tragic and fucked up
anyway, so I don't know.

24:14.733 --> 24:18.433
Thank you very much,
that's a lot of information,

24:18.767 --> 24:20.500
And we'll go do our job.

24:36.233 --> 24:40.233
We were already convinced
that Tom was sincere,

24:40.233 --> 24:41.633
That he believed
what he was saying.

24:41.633 --> 24:43.233
He certainly wasn't lying.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.900
He brought us into this
office with a safe,

24:45.900 --> 24:49.333
Opened the safe, and there was
this trove of cassette tapes,

24:49.333 --> 24:51.767
Just hours and hours of tapes.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.100
And then he starts
playing us the tapes.

24:56.067 --> 24:59.700
And the facts were there.

25:11.567 --> 25:14.733
She's just, coming
across as very controlling

25:14.733 --> 25:16.633
And very angry.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.567
Something was going on
that was outta the ordinary,

25:36.567 --> 25:40.333
And there was more to this
than what I was being told.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.833
[Courtney] I called
Seattle Police,

25:42.633 --> 25:44.733
Filed a missing person's report.

25:44.733 --> 25:46.467
[Tom] Did they ask when
you were comin' back?

25:46.467 --> 25:49.300
She filed it in the
name of Wendy O'Connor,

25:49.300 --> 25:51.067
Kurt Cobain's mother.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.933
[Courtney] If I filed
it under my own name.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.100
So all the media that
went out after that

26:01.100 --> 26:03.767
That said Kurt's mother filed
a missing person's report

26:03.767 --> 26:05.200
Was totally false.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.667
On April 4th, Kurt Cobain's
mother, Wendy O'Connor,

26:07.667 --> 26:10.133
Filed a missing person's
report on her son

26:10.133 --> 26:12.067
Because he reportedly fled a

26:12.067 --> 26:13.767
Quote end quote, "facility."

26:13.767 --> 26:16.400
She did not clarify whether
that was a drug treatment center

26:16.400 --> 26:19.067
Or not, but that's what
people are speculating.

26:19.067 --> 26:21.433
She was worried about Kurt
because he had a shotgun

26:21.433 --> 26:22.667
In his possession.

26:22.667 --> 26:25.733
She considered him suicidal.

26:25.733 --> 26:27.767
[Courtney] That should
get things going, right?

26:28.133 --> 26:29.100
[Tom] Right.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.633
[Courtney] What about Caitlin?

26:30.633 --> 26:32.467
I know that they're together.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.833
[Tom] I've got someone
watching her apartment.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.233
He hasn't showed up.

26:35.233 --> 26:36.700
I wanna put someone
on your house too,

26:36.700 --> 26:39.600
Because sooner or later
he's gonna come home.

26:40.167 --> 26:42.767
[Courtney] But if
Kurt's still in Seattle,

26:42.767 --> 26:47.100
He's hiding out, he's not
gonna be at the house.

26:48.567 --> 26:52.667
He likes to stay in hotels,
fancy hotels downtown.

26:56.167 --> 26:58.733
He uses the name Simon Richie.

26:59.867 --> 27:02.633
Mm, mm, or Bill Bailey.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.833
You should check that out.

27:06.567 --> 27:08.233
The next day, on
Monday, when we hadn't had

27:08.233 --> 27:12.700
Any success with the really
nice hotels in Seattle,

27:12.700 --> 27:16.667
We began calling some of
the other smaller motels,

27:16.667 --> 27:20.233
And we located a
motel, and there was a

27:20.233 --> 27:22.600
Bill Bailey registered there.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.800
I wanna send one of
our guys over there

27:23.800 --> 27:25.300
To see if it's Kurt.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.267
[Courtney] No no no no no
no, I don't want Kurt to know

27:26.267 --> 27:27.700
That I'm looking for him.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.067
Send somebody over there,

27:29.067 --> 27:31.667
Just have them watch
the hotel, okay?

27:32.300 --> 27:33.867
Okay.

27:36.367 --> 27:38.867
I dunno, 15 or
20 minutes went by.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.133
What do you mean
you called the hotel?

27:41.133 --> 27:43.200
I thought that you said that
you didn't want Kurt to...

27:43.200 --> 27:45.067
[Courtney] No! I, Tom...

27:45.067 --> 27:49.067
Okay, listen,
if he's not there,

27:49.067 --> 27:50.433
Then I think we need
to set up a team

27:50.433 --> 27:51.733
At the Lake Washington house.

27:51.733 --> 27:53.200
It's a waste of time, Tom.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.067
You know what, he's
not gonna be there.

27:55.067 --> 27:57.067
Is there a reason that
you don't want surveillance

27:57.067 --> 27:58.067
On your house?

27:58.067 --> 28:00.300
Yes, because we don't need it.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.200
Cali's there, he'll tell
me if Kurt shows up.

28:03.200 --> 28:08.200
(Ominous music)

28:17.633 --> 28:19.900
[Tom] Earlier in the
day in a conversation,

28:19.900 --> 28:21.867
Courtney told me she
didn't trust Cali,

28:21.867 --> 28:24.333
And she said he's one of the
best liars she's ever met.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.933
But now, all of a
sudden, she tells me

28:25.933 --> 28:27.067
He won't tell anybody.

28:27.067 --> 28:32.067
(Ominous music)

28:36.567 --> 28:37.500
[Tom] I'm not as
effective for you here

28:37.500 --> 28:38.867
As I would be up there.

28:38.867 --> 28:41.400
I'd like to move the entire
search up to Seattle.

28:42.467 --> 28:44.533
I know I got guys on the
ground there, local guys,

28:44.533 --> 28:48.133
And if I were there I could
move 'em along a little.

28:48.700 --> 28:50.967
That's fine, you can go.

28:51.467 --> 28:54.167
That's great, that's great.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.500
[Woman] Why don't you
go up there, Courtney?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.500
[Courtney] Because I can't!

28:57.500 --> 29:00.067
I have business to
take care of here.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.400
Look, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone

29:02.400 --> 29:03.900
I was traveling up there.

29:03.900 --> 29:06.200
If anyone knows,
they might tell Kurt,

29:06.200 --> 29:08.400
And then he could flee.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.333
[Courtney] Absolutely, I
think it's a really good idea.

29:12.067 --> 29:14.733
Okay, I'm gonna get goin'.

29:19.333 --> 29:22.467
[Courtney] Save the
American icon, Tom.

29:22.467 --> 29:27.467
(Ominous music)

29:29.467 --> 29:34.467
(Rock music)

29:50.400 --> 29:53.300
As I was getting
ready to fly to Seattle,

29:53.300 --> 29:55.800
Courtney told me
about Dylan Carlson.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.067
Dylan knew all the
hangouts, he knew the house

29:58.067 --> 29:59.633
Really well.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.200
Kurt's best friend
was Dylan Carlson.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.167
So what are you
thinkin', is he suicidal?

30:05.167 --> 30:06.967
No, not at all.

30:07.933 --> 30:09.733
He's been under a lotta
pressure but he's been handling

30:09.733 --> 30:11.567
Things pretty good.

30:11.567 --> 30:12.933
I know he and Courtney
have been having

30:12.933 --> 30:15.533
A lotta troubles lately, but...

30:17.600 --> 30:19.467
I don't know why
Kurt married her.

30:19.467 --> 30:21.433
They don't get along, they
don't agree about anything,

30:21.433 --> 30:24.267
They're always fighting,
that type of thing.

30:24.267 --> 30:27.200
This thing in
Rome, did anybody say

30:27.200 --> 30:29.733
That that may have been
him tryin' to kill himself?

30:29.733 --> 30:32.200
No, it was an accident.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.800
Everybody knows that.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.900
I asked him several times
about whether Kurt was

30:35.900 --> 30:39.600
Suicidal or not, and it
was almost a joke to him.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.433
It was like, "No,
of course not."

30:41.433 --> 30:45.333
'Cause I'm thinkin'
if he was as suicidal

30:45.333 --> 30:47.867
As she says he is, why would
she let him buy a shotgun?

30:47.867 --> 30:49.967
He's not suicidal.

30:49.967 --> 30:52.400
We bought that shotgun
the day he went to rehab,

30:52.400 --> 30:54.767
Been a burglary at
the house recently.

30:54.767 --> 30:57.133
The police had just
confiscated his other gun,

30:57.133 --> 30:59.433
So I registered it in my name.

31:01.833 --> 31:04.100
Trust me, if he was suicidal,
I would never let him

31:04.100 --> 31:05.933
Get a shotgun.

31:10.867 --> 31:13.067
Singer Courtney Love says
Cobain had first written

31:13.067 --> 31:15.567
A suicide note to her
which said, in part,

31:15.567 --> 31:19.067
"It's not fun for me anymore,
I can't live this life."

31:19.067 --> 31:21.167
There was a mythology
that, "Oh yeah",

31:21.167 --> 31:22.867
"Everybody knew he was suicidal,"

31:22.867 --> 31:25.133
"That was just obvious,"

31:25.133 --> 31:27.933
So it was no big surprise when
he finally killed himself.

31:27.933 --> 31:30.100
And then you go to
those closest to him,

31:30.100 --> 31:32.067
The people that knew him best,

31:32.067 --> 31:34.800
And none of them
believed he was suicidal.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.067
I've never heard Kurt talk
about suicide or anything,

31:38.067 --> 31:39.833
He always seemed
happy around me.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.733
Quiet, shy, but
definitely happy.

31:42.733 --> 31:45.600
Never hinted to me
that he was depressed.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.533
His music and his lyrics
portrayed a darker side

31:49.533 --> 31:53.500
To some of his emotions, but
I think that was glorified.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.767
People start to analyze
the lyrics and look at some

31:55.767 --> 31:57.633
Of the things that
he wrote and say,

31:57.633 --> 31:59.567
"Of course, look at
what he wrote here."

31:59.567 --> 32:02.233
"Obviously he's
talking about suicide."

32:02.233 --> 32:05.333
I'm tired of people
thinking, trying to put

32:05.333 --> 32:07.633
Too much meaning into my lyrics.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.067
A lotta times when I
write lyrics, which is

32:09.067 --> 32:12.333
At the last second
'cause I'm really lazy.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.267
And then I find myself
having to come up

32:14.267 --> 32:16.233
With explanations for it.

32:16.700 --> 32:20.100
There may be one or two lines
in a song here and there,

32:20.100 --> 32:23.433
But I swear to God,
brother, it's really not

32:23.433 --> 32:25.567
As much as it seems.

32:25.567 --> 32:27.767
The pain in his stomach,
this was a big thing

32:27.767 --> 32:30.633
This stomach pain that he'd
been suffering for years

32:30.633 --> 32:33.633
Was so severe that it made
him wanna kill himself.

32:33.633 --> 32:35.800
He did talk like that,
there's no question,

32:35.800 --> 32:39.933
And once that was
diagnosed, it was treated,

32:39.933 --> 32:41.100
And the pain went away.

32:41.100 --> 32:42.967
[Voiceover]
How's your stomach?

32:42.967 --> 32:44.067
Have you found anything to...

32:44.067 --> 32:47.067
(Sighing) It's gone.

32:47.067 --> 32:48.500
- [Voiceover] Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.833
I finally have been prescribed
the right stomach medicine

32:51.833 --> 32:56.833
After six years of being
in constant pain, finally.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.800
I haven't had a stomach
problem for over a year now.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.967
The stomach pain and the
outlook and his disposition

33:04.967 --> 33:07.067
Seem to be very closely linked.

33:07.067 --> 33:08.733
He had given an interview
to Rolling Stone,

33:08.733 --> 33:11.267
Where he said he was
happier than he'd ever been.

33:11.267 --> 33:12.067
[Voiceover] Is this your idea?

33:12.067 --> 33:13.400
(Kurt burping)

33:14.633 --> 33:18.533
When you hear Courtney
spinning this whole

33:18.533 --> 33:23.533
Elaborate timeline about how
he tried to commit suicide

33:23.533 --> 33:25.900
Before and he was
talking about suicide

33:25.900 --> 33:29.600
To everybody he knew, that
just seems to be fiction.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.567
Rather chillingly, Love
says that three of Cobain's

33:32.567 --> 33:34.867
Uncles had also
committed suicide.

33:34.867 --> 33:37.267
She calls it the Cobain curse.

33:37.267 --> 33:41.100
As far as the suicide
history in the Cobain family,

33:41.100 --> 33:43.767
Leland Cobain's father,
he was a Monte Santo

33:43.767 --> 33:47.733
Police officer, and he
went into a bar one day

33:47.733 --> 33:48.900
And he sat at a bar stool.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.767
This was back in 1938.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.433
His gun somehow dislodged
from its holster,

33:53.433 --> 33:56.767
Hit the ground, and
according to the report,

33:56.767 --> 33:59.067
He looked around in the
bar and asked if everybody

33:59.067 --> 34:00.933
Was okay, and then
immediately collapsed.

34:00.933 --> 34:03.100
He just fell dead.

34:03.767 --> 34:06.700
From what Leland has told
me about his brother,

34:06.700 --> 34:11.699
His brother was drinking
and he fell down a staircase

34:11.800 --> 34:14.067
And died from
complications of that.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.233
Neither Kurt's great-grandpa

34:15.233 --> 34:18.167
Or his great-uncle
were suicides.

34:18.933 --> 34:20.667
One of the important
elements in the case,

34:20.667 --> 34:24.067
And in convincing the
world that it was suicide

34:24.067 --> 34:27.533
Was the so-called
"Rome suicide attempt."

34:27.533 --> 34:30.167
(Drumming)

34:30.167 --> 34:31.733
Nirvana front-man Kurt Cobain,

34:31.733 --> 34:33.567
Who slipped into a coma
and was hospitalized

34:33.567 --> 34:36.100
In Rome, Italy, at about 6AM
this morning, was in a state

34:36.100 --> 34:38.800
Of what his management
calls "complete collapse."

34:38.800 --> 34:40.400
His condition was
apparently aggravated

34:40.400 --> 34:42.067
When he consumed
champagne on top of a

34:42.067 --> 34:44.600
Prescription painkiller
called Rohypnol.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.867
At the time, the word
suicide was never used

34:47.867 --> 34:50.132
By the media, by
Courtney, by Kurt.

34:50.132 --> 34:53.367
It was portrayed as an
accidental drug overdose.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.467
[Voiceover] He recovered from
the coma, and his publicists

34:55.467 --> 34:58.333
Said the incident was an
accident, not a suicide attempt.

34:58.333 --> 35:02.100
As soon as Kurt died, first
interviews that Courtney gave

35:02.100 --> 35:04.867
She started talking about
previous suicide attempts,

35:04.867 --> 35:06.833
Rome was a suicide attempt.

35:06.833 --> 35:08.967
Courtney started telling people

35:08.967 --> 35:12.067
That Kurt had
swallowed 60 pills.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.700
You swallow 60 pills,
that's not an accident.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.400
That's a suicide attempt.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.133
So we decided to contact
the doctor that treated Kurt

35:20.133 --> 35:25.133
In Rome, Doctor Galletta,
and he categorically denied

35:25.367 --> 35:28.533
That there were 60
pills in his stomach

35:28.533 --> 35:31.067
And that it was a
suicide attempt.

35:31.067 --> 35:34.700
At the time, Kurt and
Courtney both said it was

35:34.700 --> 35:37.433
An accident, and the
doctor confirmed that.

35:37.433 --> 35:40.233
So there's just no evidence
that he had ever tried

35:40.233 --> 35:41.833
To kill himself before.

35:41.833 --> 35:44.767
No anecdotal evidence,
nobody else close to Kurt

35:44.767 --> 35:47.833
Ever said that he tried
to commit suicide,

35:47.833 --> 35:50.767
But the world just took
Courtney's word for it.

36:26.733 --> 36:31.733
(Sad guitar music)

36:33.433 --> 36:35.767
While I was in Seattle with
Dylan and we were driving

36:35.767 --> 36:38.100
Around, I mentioned to
him that Courtney said

36:38.100 --> 36:41.067
That Kurt only stays
in the best hotels,

36:41.067 --> 36:43.700
And he was almost incredulous.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.767
He practically
laughed and he said,

36:45.767 --> 36:47.233
"That's ridiculous!"

36:47.233 --> 36:51.200
"He hates fancy hotels, he
stays in really cheap places,"

36:51.200 --> 36:53.700
"Mostly along the Aurora strip."

36:53.700 --> 36:55.800
Have you seen him or not?

36:56.633 --> 36:57.933
Okay, come on.

36:57.933 --> 37:02.933
(Eerie music)

37:05.200 --> 37:07.700
[Dylan] I'm gonna call
Courtney and check in.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.333
I dunno what's goin' on.

37:09.333 --> 37:12.500
Dylan told me that when
they did stay at those motels,

37:12.500 --> 37:14.667
They usually stayed
for two or three weeks,

37:14.667 --> 37:18.067
Basically living off of
Coca Cola and potato chips

37:18.067 --> 37:20.067
And doing their heroin.

37:27.100 --> 37:29.100
Courtney always wanted
to go through Dylan,

37:29.100 --> 37:31.500
She wanted to talk
to Dylan on the phone

37:31.500 --> 37:34.467
And have Dylan give
me the instructions.

37:34.467 --> 37:37.433
Courtney's had some trouble,
she was in the hospital

37:37.433 --> 37:39.367
And she got arrested.

37:39.367 --> 37:40.833
What?

37:40.833 --> 37:43.800
She said that it was all a
big mistake and she's fine.

37:44.267 --> 37:45.700
She wants us to go back
to the house and look

37:45.700 --> 37:47.533
For the shotgun again.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.867
She thinks it might be
in the hidden compartment

37:49.867 --> 37:51.567
Of the bedroom closet.

37:51.567 --> 37:53.333
Hidden compartment?

37:53.333 --> 37:55.500
She hadn't mentioned
that to us before,

37:55.500 --> 37:57.833
But she said, "That's where
Kurt keeps the shotgun",

37:57.833 --> 38:00.300
"So if it's there, that's
where it's gonna be."

38:01.133 --> 38:02.633
[Tom] Let's go.

38:03.733 --> 38:08.733
(Ominous music)

38:19.900 --> 38:21.667
Remember this from last night?

38:21.667 --> 38:23.067
[Dylan] No.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.367
The note that was
apparently written by Cali

38:26.367 --> 38:27.800
Didn't make sense.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.767
"Kurt, I can't believe you
managed to be in this house"

38:31.767 --> 38:33.500
"Without me noticing."

38:33.500 --> 38:36.567
"You're a fucking asshole
for not calling Courtney"

38:36.567 --> 38:39.633
"And at least letting her
know that you're okay."

38:39.633 --> 38:42.400
"She's in a lot of pain,
Kurt, and this morning"

38:42.400 --> 38:44.433
"She had another
accident, and now she's"

38:44.433 --> 38:46.567
"In the hospital again."

38:47.267 --> 38:49.400
We looked in that little
hidden compartment.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.367
There was no shotgun there.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.300
"She's your wife, she loves you,"

38:55.300 --> 38:57.367
"And you have a child together."

38:57.367 --> 39:00.500
"Get it together to at
least tell her you're okay,"

39:00.500 --> 39:02.400
"Or she is going to die."

39:02.400 --> 39:04.167
"It's not fair, man."

39:04.167 --> 39:05.733
"Do something now."

39:05.733 --> 39:10.733
(Eerie music)

39:15.500 --> 39:17.600
Later when I talked to
Rosemary Carroll about it

39:17.600 --> 39:19.467
And I told her I was
suspicious of it,

39:19.467 --> 39:22.767
She jumped in right away, and
she knows Cali real well, too.

39:51.833 --> 39:56.833
(Eerie music)

40:15.700 --> 40:17.967
Dylan and I headed out
to the town of Carnation,

40:17.967 --> 40:19.700
Just outside of Seattle.

40:20.633 --> 40:22.733
Kurt and Courtney
owned two cabins there,

40:22.733 --> 40:24.833
And we were curious to see if
there had been any evidence

40:24.833 --> 40:27.000
Of Kurt being there.

40:28.067 --> 40:32.033
We got about halfway there
when we stopped to get gas,

40:32.033 --> 40:34.200
And Dylan made
another phone call.

40:34.200 --> 40:39.200
(Ominous music)

40:45.667 --> 40:47.600
[Voiceover] I got a phone
call from our electrician,

40:47.600 --> 40:52.500
Gary Smith, and he was doing
some security lighting.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.933
We had a house above.

40:53.933 --> 40:55.767
We just knew it was a
rock star in Seattle,

40:55.767 --> 40:58.333
We weren't sure,
didn't know who he was.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.733
He literally just
stumbled across it.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.067
He looked through a
doorway, a glass door,

41:08.067 --> 41:11.867
A locked door,
and he saw a body.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.067
And he said, "I think
he shot himself."

41:19.067 --> 41:21.633
I called a radio station,
told 'em what happened.

41:21.633 --> 41:23.900
[Voiceover] So I answered
the call and there's a guy

41:23.900 --> 41:26.533
On the end of the line,
and he's goin', "I have got"

41:26.533 --> 41:28.800
"Some incredible news here."

41:29.733 --> 41:31.200
[Tom] Anything?

41:34.367 --> 41:36.533
A friend of mine said he
just heard they found a body

41:36.533 --> 41:38.700
At Kurt's house.

41:38.700 --> 41:40.167
[Tom] What?

41:45.400 --> 41:47.533
[Voiceover] Rock
group Nirvana is dead.

41:47.533 --> 41:49.200
An electrician
discovered Cobain's body

41:49.200 --> 41:51.867
In the singer's Lake
Washington home this morning.

41:51.867 --> 41:54.267
The electrician tells KOMO
news that emergency crews

41:54.267 --> 41:56.800
Told him that the dead
man is Kurt Cobain.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.267
[Tom] When I heard
that the body was found

41:58.267 --> 42:00.967
In a room that was called
the Greenhouse, I turned

42:00.967 --> 42:04.333
To Dylan and I said,
"What's the Greenhouse?"

42:04.333 --> 42:06.400
And he said, "It's just
a dirty little room"

42:06.400 --> 42:07.633
"Above the garage."

42:07.633 --> 42:09.767
They stored lumber or
something in there.

42:09.767 --> 42:11.533
It sounded to me
like this was just

42:11.533 --> 42:13.600
Some kinda broom
closet or something.

42:13.600 --> 42:14.800
[Voiceover] So do you
think he intentionally

42:14.800 --> 42:17.067
Did not tell you to
check that room out?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.700
[Tom] Again, I hope the
listeners bear in mind

42:19.700 --> 42:21.933
We're having to skip over
an awful lotta stuff...

42:21.933 --> 42:26.067
(Eerie music)

42:26.067 --> 42:28.067
I glanced down on
the floor and I saw

42:28.067 --> 42:29.967
Something that looked
like a mannequin.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.067
I can see blood in this
ear, and long hair,

42:34.067 --> 42:37.633
And immediately got
a little shaken.

42:42.133 --> 42:44.067
The French doors were locked.

42:45.667 --> 42:47.967
I was first in and
right away could see

42:47.967 --> 42:50.200
That it was a fatality.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.133
The shotgun lay in his lap,
a significant pool of blood

42:55.133 --> 42:56.767
By his head.

42:56.767 --> 42:58.067
There was nothing
we could do for him,

42:58.067 --> 43:00.067
So we didn't touch the body.

43:01.133 --> 43:04.500
We'll check for mail or
somethin' with a name on it.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.500
The officer said, "Do
you want the name?"

43:08.500 --> 43:10.400
Knowing I needed
it for my log book.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.367
He said, "It's
Cobain, Kurt Cobain."

43:14.167 --> 43:16.067
A couple of second delay
and my head snappin' around,

43:16.067 --> 43:19.067
I said, "You mean
the rock star?"

43:20.067 --> 43:22.600
[Voiceover] The developing
story shocks the music world.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.767
A man found dead this morning
is rock star Kurt Cobain.

43:25.767 --> 43:27.800
[Voiceover] Cobain's
body was found about a...

43:27.800 --> 43:29.233
[Voiceover] Apparently
it was a suicide...

43:29.233 --> 43:34.167
(Various voiceovers
speaking simultaneously)

43:38.467 --> 43:39.767
[Voiceover] Was so severe
that his body could only

43:39.767 --> 43:41.833
Be identified by fingerprints.

43:41.833 --> 43:43.400
[Voiceover] Police can't
release the details found

43:43.400 --> 43:46.100
In Cobain's suicide note,
but over the past couple

43:46.100 --> 43:49.133
Of years, Cobain has
had some tough times.

43:49.133 --> 43:50.867
Cobain was 27.

43:50.867 --> 43:54.300
He joins a growing list of
rock stars who burn bright

43:54.300 --> 43:56.633
Then burn out tragically.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.067
[Tom] When we
arrived at the property

43:59.067 --> 44:01.500
It was broad daylight and
the Greenhouse stuck out

44:01.500 --> 44:02.933
Like a sore thumb.

44:02.933 --> 44:05.067
You could see it from the
street above the bushes,

44:05.067 --> 44:06.467
It was so tall.

44:06.467 --> 44:10.733
I just didn't understand why
he didn't point that out to me.

44:13.133 --> 44:14.733
[Dylan] That's
Entertainment Tonight.

44:15.333 --> 44:16.767
He's Rolling Stone.

44:16.767 --> 44:19.100
Dylan didn't like the
press and he said Kurt didn't

44:19.100 --> 44:20.600
Like the press.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.867
[Dylan] Current Affairs;
stay away from them.

44:23.433 --> 44:24.567
[Officer] Ho ho ho.

44:24.567 --> 44:25.567
[Tom] I'm Tom
Grant, how are you?

44:25.567 --> 44:26.933
[Officer] Fine.

44:26.933 --> 44:29.333
[Tom] I was hired by
Courtney Love to investigate

44:29.333 --> 44:30.867
The disappearance
of her husband.

44:30.867 --> 44:33.600
I've got information I
think would be helpful.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.567
Could I speak to the
detective in charge?

44:37.200 --> 44:38.067
Wait here.

44:38.067 --> 44:43.067
(Eerie music)

44:50.567 --> 44:52.567
He said he's too busy
to speak with you now.

44:52.567 --> 44:55.567
Call the station after 3PM;
you can talk to him then.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.567
I was dumbfounded by that.

44:57.567 --> 45:00.933
If I were a police officer
investigating the dead body

45:00.933 --> 45:03.867
And somebody told me
there was somebody outside

45:03.867 --> 45:06.200
That had been in the
house the night before,

45:06.200 --> 45:08.167
I'd tell them, "Hold him."

45:08.167 --> 45:10.867
"If they say they need
to leave, handcuff 'em,"

45:10.867 --> 45:13.667
"And keep 'em there until we
get a chance to talk to 'em."

45:13.667 --> 45:15.300
You don't let
somebody like that go,

45:15.300 --> 45:18.667
You don't take a chance until
you've fully investigated

45:18.667 --> 45:23.467
A case and determined
positively how this person died.

45:23.467 --> 45:24.900
The Seattle Police
Department claimed

45:24.900 --> 45:28.100
They were investigating
this as a possible homicide.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.500
If they were, they certainly
wouldn't allow somebody

45:30.500 --> 45:33.200
To leave when they'd been
in the house the night

45:33.200 --> 45:36.333
Before a dead body was
found on the property.

45:36.867 --> 45:38.067
I'm Norm Stamper.

45:38.067 --> 45:40.733
I was a police
officer for 34 years,

45:40.733 --> 45:45.733
And last six from 1994 to 2000
as Seattle's police chief.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.900
I wouldn't pretend that
there aren't police officers

45:48.900 --> 45:53.100
Who are cynical and
suspicious and skeptical.

45:53.100 --> 45:57.100
That was the case in
the Kurt Cobain death.

45:59.400 --> 46:03.067
(Eerie music)

46:03.067 --> 46:04.800
John F. Kennedy,
Martin Luther King,

46:04.800 --> 46:07.533
Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe.

46:07.533 --> 46:09.867
Over the past 50 years as a

46:09.867 --> 46:12.167
Medical-legal forensic
pathology consultant,

46:12.167 --> 46:15.067
I've been involved in
thousands of cases,

46:15.067 --> 46:17.833
About 18,000 autopsies,
and I have reviewed,

46:17.833 --> 46:20.867
Signed off or
supervised, and evaluated

46:20.867 --> 46:23.600
About 38,000 other autopsies.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.600
I have personally
investigated, supervised,

46:25.600 --> 46:28.433
Consulted and researched
on over 8,000 homicides.

46:28.433 --> 46:30.900
I wrote Practical Homicide
Investigation because there was

46:30.900 --> 46:35.433
A need for a standard protocol
to approach all death scenes.

46:35.433 --> 46:38.533
From the very beginning,
everything that the detectives

46:38.533 --> 46:42.633
Encountered indicated to
them that this was a suicide.

46:42.633 --> 46:47.600
The decision to rule the
case by police the same day

46:47.600 --> 46:49.967
And to make a public
pronouncement that this was

46:49.967 --> 46:54.333
A suicide is not the
way good police agencies

46:54.333 --> 46:55.767
Would function today.

46:55.767 --> 46:57.267
As a homicide commander,

46:57.267 --> 46:59.067
I would not be making
any proclamations

46:59.067 --> 47:02.300
That the case was a suicide
without the evidence

47:02.300 --> 47:04.300
Having been processed:
the victimology,

47:04.300 --> 47:06.833
The medical-legal
process, toxicology.

47:06.833 --> 47:08.233
It's a death investigation.

47:08.233 --> 47:10.700
They knew nothing
about the drug level,

47:10.700 --> 47:13.067
They knew nothing
about fingerprints,

47:13.067 --> 47:15.067
They knew nothing about
anything else at that time

47:15.067 --> 47:17.300
Except that they had
found him with a shotgun.

47:17.300 --> 47:19.700
The reason we call things
death investigations is

47:19.700 --> 47:21.933
That we don't wanna
prematurely make them

47:21.933 --> 47:24.067
Homicides, suicides
or accidents.

47:24.067 --> 47:25.700
It's a death investigation.

47:25.700 --> 47:29.600
Cases that involve
prominent figures,

47:29.600 --> 47:34.367
These cases usually take
more time because you know

47:34.367 --> 47:36.233
That there are gonna
be more questions.

47:36.233 --> 47:37.833
People are gonna wanna
know every single

47:37.833 --> 47:38.967
Thing about it.

47:38.967 --> 47:40.667
In the Philip
Seymour Hoffman case,

47:40.667 --> 47:43.200
They found him with
a needle in his arm.

47:43.200 --> 47:46.300
They found 50 bags
of heroin right there

47:46.300 --> 47:48.367
In his apartment, and
yet they did not make

47:48.367 --> 47:50.267
Any announcement beyond that.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.567
They knew that they
should not be commenting.

47:52.567 --> 47:55.467
Official statements as to
cause and manner of death

47:55.467 --> 47:58.867
Do not come from police or
even homicide detectives.

47:58.867 --> 48:00.567
They do not.

48:03.167 --> 48:05.767
I've never believed that
the police were involved

48:05.767 --> 48:09.167
From the beginning in
any kind of a conspiracy

48:09.167 --> 48:11.633
Involving Kurt Cobain's death.

48:11.633 --> 48:14.333
I think they were set
up by Courtney Love

48:14.333 --> 48:16.267
From that missing
person's report,

48:16.267 --> 48:18.300
And everything
that it said in it.

48:18.300 --> 48:22.367
If my officers heard
or were made aware

48:22.367 --> 48:25.800
That Kurt Cobain had
left rehab, had purchased

48:25.800 --> 48:29.567
A shotgun, was suicidal,
that's of course going

48:29.567 --> 48:30.933
To affect them.

48:30.933 --> 48:33.900
They, what I call assumed
the suicide position,

48:33.900 --> 48:36.067
Which to me means cut
corners, not do this,

48:36.067 --> 48:39.067
Not do that, because it's
a suicide, no problem.

48:39.067 --> 48:41.067
I have to admit, there's
been a lot of inconsistencies

48:41.067 --> 48:42.333
In this case.

48:42.333 --> 48:43.867
Really?

48:43.867 --> 48:46.200
The reports that were
coming out in the media said

48:46.200 --> 48:49.567
Kurt Cobain was barricaded
inside the Greenhouse.

48:49.567 --> 48:51.400
Look at this photograph.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.433
Is that the lock
you're talking about?

48:54.133 --> 48:55.500
I dunno where
this picture's from,

48:55.500 --> 48:57.467
So I couldn't say.

48:57.467 --> 48:59.133
Well, it's from
the Greenhouse.

48:59.133 --> 49:01.167
I've been over the
place inside and out,

49:01.167 --> 49:03.700
And trust me, that
is the only lock.

49:03.700 --> 49:05.067
If you say so.

49:05.900 --> 49:08.133
Presuming I'm
telling you the truth,

49:08.133 --> 49:10.400
Why would you say that
he locked himself in?

49:10.400 --> 49:13.833
Because the door was locked.

49:13.833 --> 49:15.067
Look at the picture.

49:15.067 --> 49:17.067
It's not a deadbolt,
it's a twist lock.

49:17.067 --> 49:19.400
Anybody coulda twisted that
lock and pulled the door shut

49:19.400 --> 49:20.667
Behind 'em when they left.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.367
Look, the lock doesn't matter.

49:22.367 --> 49:24.900
There was a stool wedged
up against the door.

49:24.900 --> 49:26.233
Now how do you wedge
a stool against a door

49:26.233 --> 49:27.700
After you've already
left the room?

49:27.700 --> 49:30.500
[Tom] The police reports
plainly states that the stool

49:30.500 --> 49:33.200
Was simply sitting in
front of the two unlocked

49:33.200 --> 49:36.100
French doors at the
other side of the room,

49:36.100 --> 49:39.067
But on one of the reports,
it was added that the stool

49:39.067 --> 49:41.633
Was blocking the entrance.

49:43.133 --> 49:44.600
Someone reported
that there was a stool

49:44.600 --> 49:45.633
Blocking the door.

49:45.633 --> 49:46.567
That wasn't the case.

49:46.567 --> 49:48.167
I dunno where that came from.

49:48.167 --> 49:49.733
If you could just
show me the photographs

49:49.733 --> 49:52.200
Your officer took at the
scene, we can put that issue

49:52.200 --> 49:53.433
To rest once and for all.

49:53.433 --> 49:55.600
Well the photographs
haven't been developed,

49:55.600 --> 49:57.667
Probably never will be.

49:57.667 --> 50:01.367
We don't develop
photographs on suicides.

50:02.233 --> 50:03.600
I have never heard of that.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.433
Every case I've been
involved, with the crime scene

50:05.433 --> 50:06.733
Photographs were developed.

50:06.733 --> 50:08.533
Why not release 'em
to other experts?

50:08.533 --> 50:10.000
I can't answer that question.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.567
It was something that the
Seattle Police department did.

50:13.567 --> 50:16.267
In hindsight, they
probably shouldn't have.

50:16.267 --> 50:17.867
But that's what they did.

50:17.867 --> 50:20.500
Nothing you've said
convinces me this is anything

50:20.500 --> 50:22.333
But a suicide.

50:22.933 --> 50:25.467
Now do you got any
other pearls for me?

50:27.100 --> 50:28.600
[Tom] Not at this time.

50:29.300 --> 50:32.367
Detective Cameron
resigned when he learned

50:32.367 --> 50:34.400
I was preparing to fire him.

50:34.400 --> 50:37.333
He had colluded with one
of his own detectives

50:37.333 --> 50:41.033
To replant evidence
that had been stolen

50:41.033 --> 50:45.067
By a homicide detective
at a homicide scene.

50:45.067 --> 50:47.067
And it was for that reason
that I was preparing

50:47.067 --> 50:48.700
To fire him.

50:56.233 --> 50:57.667
I'm just giving you
the information I have,

50:57.667 --> 51:00.100
I don't care what
you do with it.

51:00.467 --> 51:03.633
I understand that, but
I think your investigation

51:03.633 --> 51:06.900
Is into things that our
investigation doesn't apply to.

51:21.067 --> 51:23.067
You don't allow
a patrol officer

51:23.067 --> 51:26.067
With no homicide
investigative experience

51:26.067 --> 51:28.733
To determine whether a
scene is a suicide or not.

51:34.400 --> 51:37.400
My opinion is, in 1994,

51:37.400 --> 51:39.300
They just didn't
look at anything.

51:39.300 --> 51:42.467
If it appeared to be a
suicide, it was a suicide.

51:42.467 --> 51:44.267
Case closed.

51:45.467 --> 51:50.467
(Somber music)

52:19.100 --> 52:22.167
The news media do
poison the atmosphere,

52:22.167 --> 52:24.333
And I have been involved
in cases in which

52:24.333 --> 52:28.833
It was impossible, almost,
to overcome the beliefs

52:28.833 --> 52:31.467
That had been created
within the community

52:31.467 --> 52:34.267
Because of the way in
which that particular death

52:34.267 --> 52:35.467
Had been reported.

52:35.467 --> 52:36.800
Judging by the
evidence at the scene,

52:36.800 --> 52:38.900
Love says, Cobain
apparently drew a chair up

52:38.900 --> 52:41.733
To a window looking out
on Puget Sound, sat down,

52:41.733 --> 52:43.767
Took some more drugs,
picked up his shotgun and,

52:43.767 --> 52:46.433
Using his thumb, it seems,
shot himself in the head.

52:46.433 --> 52:48.267
The physical damage was so
severe that his body could

52:48.267 --> 52:50.600
Only be identified
by fingerprints.

52:50.600 --> 52:51.933
I was a bit surprised.

52:51.933 --> 52:53.567
Normally a shotgun
wound to the head,

52:53.567 --> 52:55.467
The ones I've seen,
are pretty devastating,

52:55.467 --> 52:57.933
Often making facial
features unrecognizable.

52:57.933 --> 53:00.867
His head was not grossly
deformed or badly damaged.

53:00.867 --> 53:03.100
I think I certainly
would've recognized him.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.067
I don't see any reason
why anyone wouldn't have,

53:05.067 --> 53:06.467
Who knew what he looked like.

53:06.467 --> 53:08.433
Seattle's own police
reports indicate

53:08.433 --> 53:12.133
That Officer Lavendowski
found Kurt Cobain's wallet

53:12.133 --> 53:14.067
Lyin' on the floor.

53:14.067 --> 53:17.433
He opened it up and removed
his driver's license,

53:17.433 --> 53:20.067
And he put it on top
of Cobain's wallet

53:20.067 --> 53:22.433
To take a photograph
for evidence.

53:22.433 --> 53:25.067
Most of the media
reported that Kurt left

53:25.067 --> 53:27.833
His driver's license exposed,
and a lot of 'em went

53:27.833 --> 53:29.467
Into a lotta detail:

53:29.467 --> 53:32.433
That he did that so that
everyone would recognize him.

53:32.433 --> 53:34.600
But it was completely false.

54:09.167 --> 54:11.267
Love, who, contrary to
rumor, says she and Cobain

54:11.267 --> 54:14.100
Hadn't broken up, says
Cobain had first written

54:14.100 --> 54:16.633
A suicide note to her
which said, in part,

54:16.633 --> 54:18.533
"It's not fun for me anymore."

54:18.533 --> 54:20.167
"I can't live this life."

54:20.167 --> 54:23.333
News media play a great
role in these matters.

54:23.333 --> 54:25.500
John Kennedy,
incidentally, pointed out

54:25.500 --> 54:28.700
The need for integrity
within the news media.

54:28.700 --> 54:30.200
This has been something
that was commented

54:30.200 --> 54:33.633
Upon going back to
our founding fathers,

54:33.633 --> 54:36.267
Because sometimes
pressures from news media

54:36.267 --> 54:39.267
Can be very, very significant.

54:39.267 --> 54:41.433
I don't have the
right to make an opinion

54:41.433 --> 54:44.300
On anything that I read
or see on television

54:44.300 --> 54:48.067
Until I go to the fuckin'
source myself, personally.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.900
The toxicology report
from Kurt Cobain's autopsy

54:54.900 --> 54:59.867
Indicated a heroin blood level
of 1.52 milligrams per liter.

54:59.867 --> 55:02.967
Five milligrams
will produce a level

55:02.967 --> 55:06.600
Of 0.035 milligrams.

55:06.600 --> 55:09.067
Most users, even heavy users,

55:09.067 --> 55:12.967
Only use up to 40 to 60
milligrams in one hit.

55:12.967 --> 55:17.333
So you can see, to reach
1.52 milligrams per liter,

55:17.333 --> 55:19.767
You're talking about an
amount that would have

55:19.767 --> 55:24.767
Certainly have exceeded 200
milligrams that were injected

55:24.867 --> 55:26.533
Into Kurt Cobain.

55:26.533 --> 55:29.533
Three times the amount that
would be considered lethal.

55:29.533 --> 55:32.467
I think very legitimate
questions have been raised

55:32.467 --> 55:34.067
About the level of heroin.

55:34.067 --> 55:37.733
We have not, in 18
years, found a single case

55:37.733 --> 55:41.633
Where somebody could
have the level of heroin

55:41.633 --> 55:45.967
In their body that Kurt did
and still remain conscious.

55:45.967 --> 55:47.333
[Voiceover] 70
times the lethal dose

55:47.333 --> 55:49.833
For the average person,
triple the lethal dose

55:49.833 --> 55:51.667
Even for the most
severe heroin addict.

55:51.667 --> 55:53.100
It would have incapacitated him,

55:53.100 --> 55:54.700
He would have been unconscious.

55:54.700 --> 55:57.267
And then roll down
their sleeves, put
away their heroin kit,

55:57.267 --> 55:59.133
Pick up the shotgun,
position it backwards

55:59.133 --> 56:00.967
And pull the trigger.

56:01.633 --> 56:04.233
That deals with
coordinative functions.

56:04.233 --> 56:07.600
How about the emotional
aspects of this?

56:07.600 --> 56:11.433
Why would he then shoot
himself before the drug

56:11.433 --> 56:14.433
Has had a chance to take effect?

56:14.500 --> 56:18.833
No study that I know
of has correlated use

56:18.833 --> 56:21.967
Of heroin with suicide.

56:21.967 --> 56:25.833
I cannot think of a case
in which I have had someone

56:25.833 --> 56:29.700
Inject himself with a
large amount of heroin

56:29.700 --> 56:32.200
And then proceed
to kill himself.

56:32.200 --> 56:35.200
It just doesn't make sense,
and it doesn't fit in

56:35.200 --> 56:38.600
With these kinds of
situations involving heroin.

56:38.600 --> 56:41.533
These are questions that
I think deserve answers,

56:41.533 --> 56:43.400
And in fact, require answers.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.767
Many of the questions
could be answered

56:46.767 --> 56:51.067
If the medical examiner's
office would make public

56:51.067 --> 56:53.067
The autopsy report.

56:53.067 --> 56:56.133
I haven't been able to
see the toxicology report

56:56.133 --> 57:00.100
Or the autopsy report
because I haven't had access

57:00.100 --> 57:03.867
To review the actual
documentation from
the authorities.

57:03.867 --> 57:06.900
The autopsy report
is public record.

57:06.900 --> 57:10.867
Apparently in this
jurisdiction, it is not.

57:10.867 --> 57:13.867
In the case of Kurt Cobain,
they should've made them part

57:13.867 --> 57:16.100
Of the release with the
Freedom of Information.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.367
Why they didn't
do that, I dunno.

57:17.367 --> 57:19.467
In hindsight, maybe
they should've.

57:19.467 --> 57:21.833
We wouldn't be having
this discussion today.

57:23.500 --> 57:27.467
There was a documentary
made about 1997, I believe,

57:27.467 --> 57:29.067
Called "Kurt and Courtney."

57:29.067 --> 57:31.933
I cooperated with the
producer and director of that,

57:31.933 --> 57:33.533
Nick Broomfield.

57:34.233 --> 57:37.067
[Voiceover] Tom Grant's
assertion that 1.52 milligrams

57:37.067 --> 57:40.067
Of heroin per liter of blood
would have incapacitated

57:40.067 --> 57:43.567
Kurt were discounted
by Doctor Colin Brewer,

57:43.567 --> 57:46.633
Formerly director at
Westminster Hospital.

57:46.633 --> 57:49.567
He gave us this color slide
of a patient balancing easily

57:49.567 --> 57:52.067
On one leg, who had
taken the equivalent

57:52.067 --> 57:55.067
Of over twice the
amount taken by Kurt.

57:55.067 --> 57:58.167
The problem is that this
man had taken methadone,

57:58.167 --> 58:02.067
Not heroin, and he had
swallowed the methadone.

58:02.067 --> 58:04.733
Methadone is a
pain medication.

58:04.733 --> 58:07.267
It's also used to
treat heroin addiction,

58:07.267 --> 58:10.733
And because it's taken orally,
it 's absorbed much slower.

58:10.733 --> 58:13.933
It takes time to get into
the blood, so it can take

58:13.933 --> 58:16.400
Up to an hour or perhaps
two before it reaches

58:16.400 --> 58:19.233
Its highest concentrations.

58:19.233 --> 58:23.133
Heroin, on the other hand,
injected directly into the vein,

58:23.133 --> 58:26.267
Is immediately available
to circulation,

58:26.267 --> 58:28.233
Immediately available
to the brain.

58:28.233 --> 58:33.200
Comparing oral methadone
to intravenous heroin.

58:33.767 --> 58:37.067
What's the trade expression,
apples and oranges?

58:37.067 --> 58:38.833
It's much worse than
apples and oranges.

58:38.833 --> 58:41.700
It might be peaches and
asparagus that you're comparing.

58:41.700 --> 58:44.600
I'm surely amazed that a
competent forensic scientist

58:44.600 --> 58:47.833
Would have made that
kind of comparison.

58:47.833 --> 58:52.833
(Eerie music)

58:53.533 --> 58:55.100
[Voiceover] Seattle
police reports indicate

58:55.100 --> 58:59.067
That Kurt Cobain was found
with a shotgun upside down,

58:59.067 --> 59:01.067
With his left hand
grasping the barrel

59:01.067 --> 59:04.233
In a vise-like grip, known
as a cadaveric spasm.

59:05.233 --> 59:08.067
Cadaveric spasm is a form
of muscular stiffening

59:08.067 --> 59:10.467
That only occurs in death.

59:10.467 --> 59:14.133
This occurrence is indispensable
to forensic investigation,

59:14.133 --> 59:17.633
As it clearly shows the precise
orientation of the deceased

59:17.633 --> 59:20.133
At the exact moment of death;

59:20.133 --> 59:22.167
In this case, Cobain's left hand

59:22.167 --> 59:25.667
Gripping the barrel upside
down, as he was found.

59:25.667 --> 59:27.133
(Camera shutter)

59:27.133 --> 59:29.867
This all seemed straightforward,
until you take into account

59:29.867 --> 59:33.200
The shotgun shell was found
to Cobain's left side,

59:33.200 --> 59:36.067
Opposite of where we'd
expect to find the shell:

59:36.067 --> 59:39.067
On Cobain's right side.

59:39.067 --> 59:42.433
The exit chamber is clearly
on Cobain's right side

59:42.433 --> 59:45.400
If it was fired upside
down, as it was found,

59:45.400 --> 59:49.167
And as the cadaveric
spasm confirms

59:49.167 --> 59:51.800
Seattle P.D. explained
the illogical trajectory

59:51.800 --> 59:54.467
Of the shotgun shell by
concluding that the shotgun

59:54.467 --> 59:57.067
Was fired right
side up by Cobain,

59:57.067 --> 01:00:00.167
The shotgun flipped upside
down, expelling the shell

01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:02.867
To his left, to finally
rest in the position

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:04.500
That it was found.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.467
This proposed scenario
is impossible, not only

01:00:07.467 --> 01:00:10.767
Because shotguns do not
flip upside down when fired;

01:00:10.767 --> 01:00:13.133
It completely ignores
the cadaveric spasm

01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:16.800
That locks the grip, dictating
the precise orientation

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.967
Of the shotgun when fired.

01:00:18.967 --> 01:00:22.400
In order for the scenario the
Seattle police stated occurred

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.000
Cobain's wrist would
have to bend at an angle

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.033
That is anatomically impossible.

01:00:28.033 --> 01:00:31.433
The cadaveric spasm shows
the precise orientation

01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:34.933
Of Cobain's hand at the
exact moment of death.

01:00:34.933 --> 01:00:37.800
The only way that the shell
could end up in the opposite

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.433
Side of the room is if,
when the shell was expelled,

01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:44.000
Hit an obstruction on
Cobain's right side

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.800
And ricocheted to Cobain's left
side, to land on the jacket.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.000
The crime scene clearly shows
there was no such obstruction,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.433
Which then puts into question
if Cobain truly was alone

01:00:55.433 --> 01:00:58.767
In the Greenhouse when
the trigger was pulled.

01:00:59.567 --> 01:01:02.067
[Rosemary] Kurt
was not suicidal.

01:01:02.567 --> 01:01:03.900
Have you been watchin' TV?

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.067
Readin' the paper?

01:01:05.067 --> 01:01:06.500
They're all saying
that he's been suicidal

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.467
For a long time, and Courtney
said that this overdose,

01:01:08.467 --> 01:01:09.800
The one that was
in Rome, she said

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.233
That was a suicide attempt.

01:01:11.233 --> 01:01:12.533
That's not true.

01:01:12.533 --> 01:01:14.533
It was Rosemary
Carroll's involvement

01:01:14.533 --> 01:01:17.300
That really pushed me
forward, because if somebody

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.833
In Rosemary Carroll's
position was telling me

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.200
The things she was telling me,

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.167
Then I wasn't off
base, I wasn't crazy,

01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:28.667
I wasn't a lunatic.

01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.200
She called me a
couple of weeks ago,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.600
Said Kurt was leaving her and
asked me to find the meanest,

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.133
Most vicious divorce
lawyer I could find.

01:01:35.133 --> 01:01:36.333
She even asked me
if there was any way

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:37.633
To avoid their prenup.

01:01:37.633 --> 01:01:39.100
And she said about
that same time,

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.867
Kurt had called her also
and asked her if she could

01:01:41.867 --> 01:01:44.433
Have Courtney's name
taken outta the will.

01:01:44.433 --> 01:01:49.433
(Eerie music)

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.367
Does it seem strange
that Courtney didn't go

01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:04.633
Up to Seattle, not even
once, to look for him?

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.433
Absolutely.

01:02:07.167 --> 01:02:09.167
When I offered to go up,
she said she couldn't go

01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:12.200
With me because she had some
business down here in L.A.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.433
She didn't have
any business in L.A.

01:02:14.933 --> 01:02:17.167
What I don't understand
is how you didn't see him

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:19.133
In the Greenhouse the
first night you were there.

01:02:19.133 --> 01:02:20.600
Wait a minute, I didn't
even know the Greenhouse

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.833
Existed until the day I
heard it on the radio.

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.833
But Courtney told
Dylan to check it.

01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:26.667
When he called Courtney at
my house Wednesday night,

01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:30.067
I heard her tell him to
check the Greenhouse.

01:02:39.067 --> 01:02:42.500
A lotta people mock him
for being at the house,

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.333
On the case, looking for Kurt.

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:47.500
Kurt was lying dead 20 feet
away and he never found him.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:51.400
What does that say about
his abilities as a P.I?

01:02:52.233 --> 01:02:54.433
I went back on a rainy night.

01:02:54.433 --> 01:02:57.467
He claims it was dark and
just didn't know it was there.

01:02:57.467 --> 01:02:59.767
Nobody told him, Dylan
certainly didn't tell him.

01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:02.067
Dylan must have known
that it was there.

01:03:02.067 --> 01:03:03.800
[Tom] Is there anywhere else?

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.167
No.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.133
[Max] So I went and tested
that, and sure enough,

01:03:08.133 --> 01:03:10.067
You really couldn't see
it if you weren't looking

01:03:10.067 --> 01:03:11.267
For it specifically.

01:03:11.267 --> 01:03:16.267
(Eerie music)

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.367
I asked Courtney to see the
note when I was in Seattle,

01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:31.867
And she refused.

01:03:31.867 --> 01:03:33.833
Courtney apparently
had let Danny Goldberg,

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:36.400
Her husband, see the
note, but she wouldn't let

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.200
Rosemary see it, so
that mystified her too

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.867
And made her more suspicious.

01:03:40.867 --> 01:03:43.833
And it made me more
suspicious, too.

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:47.067
To hear Courtney's own lawyer,

01:03:47.067 --> 01:03:49.733
Kurt and Courtney's
entertainment lawyer,
Rosemary Carroll,

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.067
The godmother of Frances Bean,

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.367
Somebody that knew them
better than almost anybody,

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.200
Telling Tom that

01:04:02.067 --> 01:04:04.967
They were in the
middle of a divorce,

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:07.533
That Kurt was drawing
up a new will,

01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:11.067
And most importantly,
I think the tape

01:04:11.067 --> 01:04:14.600
That really had me reeling,

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.433
Was hearing Rosemary Carroll
looking at the suicide note

01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:22.800
And immediately concluding
that it's a forgery.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.500
I believe Courtney never
thought the public was gonna

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.400
Ever see that note.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.933
If I hadn't have tricked her
out of a copy of the note,

01:05:09.933 --> 01:05:11.767
They wouldn't have seen it.

01:05:12.567 --> 01:05:14.367
I heard you read the
note on TV the other day

01:05:14.367 --> 01:05:16.967
And I'm just a little
confused about something.

01:05:17.767 --> 01:05:21.233
It sounded like the note
said, "I'm lying on the bed."

01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:23.967
If Kurt was lying in the
bed when he wrote the note,

01:05:23.967 --> 01:05:26.700
Why was the bed so neat when
I came here the other night?

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.067
It looked like nobody
had been on the bed.

01:05:29.067 --> 01:05:32.067
I was lying on the bed,
recording the message

01:05:32.067 --> 01:05:33.833
For Kurt's fans.

01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:35.600
Are you sure
that's what you said?

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.100
Because I was under the
impression that Kurt was lying

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.233
On the bed.

01:05:40.233 --> 01:05:42.733
Look, I'll show you, okay?

01:05:44.233 --> 01:05:48.800
It's just a copy, but the
cops have the original.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:55.200
I can't read this
without my glasses.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.967
I'm gonna take it down, make
a copy in the fax machine.

01:05:56.967 --> 01:05:58.600
I'll read it later.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.433
Yeah, sure.

01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:17.700
[Rosemary] That I never
thought to look at at all,

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.667
Quite honestly,
until last night.

01:06:20.667 --> 01:06:22.633
She left it after she
came over to my house,

01:06:22.633 --> 01:06:24.100
The night of the 6th.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.800
Rosemary Carroll was working
with me behind the scenes,

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.733
Privately, giving
me information.

01:06:29.733 --> 01:06:32.400
She did it out of
a good conscience.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.667
[Rosemary] What do
you think that is?

01:06:57.467 --> 01:07:02.467
(Eerie music)

01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:14.667
[Courtney] (Indistinct)
conference on your phone,

01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:16.700
And that way you could...

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.100
[Tom] You've promised
me things before,

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.067
And it didn't come through.

01:08:21.533 --> 01:08:23.800
Almost immediately
after Kurt Cobain's death

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.633
Was announced in the
media, this phenomenon

01:08:26.633 --> 01:08:29.466
Of copycat suicides began.

01:08:29.466 --> 01:08:31.733
Kids started killing themselves:

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:34.500
Kurt Cobain fans, Nirvana fans.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.067
This was happening
all around the world.

01:08:37.067 --> 01:08:41.466
Now I'm a dad
myself, and it's just,

01:08:42.933 --> 01:08:44.100
Absolutely breaks my heart.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.899
I talk to a lotta the families.

01:08:46.633 --> 01:08:50.466
When you read their suicide
notes and read their journals,

01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:54.233
It really drove
home the importance

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.332
Of Kurt on this generation.

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:01.800
The thought of losing
a child is just horrific.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.100
I was relieved that I was
gonna go forward with this,

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.167
Because I thought,
"Maybe it'll help stop"

01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:09.167
"Some of these
copycat suicides."

01:09:09.167 --> 01:09:14.167
(Sad music)

01:09:33.767 --> 01:09:35.300
[Tom] That would help
too, to be analyzed.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.867
We could determine whether
Kurt wrote that whole thing.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.300
The fact that the
handwriting looks,

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.500
To my untrained eye,
different at the bottom

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.133
Of that note than it
does during the body

01:09:48.133 --> 01:09:50.533
It certainly does suggest
that putting that note

01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:53.533
In the hands of a questioned
documents examiner,

01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:57.700
Somebody who really understands
a lot more than we do

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.167
As cops, that would
be a good idea.

01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:03.100
A forensic document
examiner examines documents

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.700
For the purposes
of authenticity.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.633
I examined a handwriting
sample that was found

01:10:08.633 --> 01:10:12.500
In Courtney Love's backpack,
and it was a practice sheet

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.833
Of different letters,
the alphabet.

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:20.500
I examined that in comparison
to the suicide note.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.133
What I did find interesting
about the practice sheet is

01:10:23.133 --> 01:10:26.300
That it did have
letter combinations
and specific letters

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:31.300
That are found in the bottom
portion of the suicide note.

01:10:31.367 --> 01:10:34.933
It is possible that somebody
else with some skill

01:10:34.933 --> 01:10:38.400
Could indeed
imitate his writing,

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.900
Especially those last few lines.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.533
One of the, perhaps
surprising, characteristics

01:10:46.533 --> 01:10:51.067
Of this note is that the
largest section of the note,

01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:54.333
Or the initial part, talks so
much about his relationship

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:58.433
To music, and it's only the
very small part of the note,

01:10:58.433 --> 01:11:02.467
The last four lines, that
talks about his relationship

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.100
To his family.

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.733
But there's another
linguistically interesting thing

01:11:07.733 --> 01:11:12.733
About the second or final
four lines of the note,

01:11:13.433 --> 01:11:18.433
And that is that that is what
most of us would consider

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:21.733
A stereotypical suicide note.

01:11:22.133 --> 01:11:25.667
"I love you, someone will
be better off without me,"

01:11:25.667 --> 01:11:27.467
"Keep moving forward."

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.167
Those are the kinds of
things we expect to find

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:36.500
In suicide notes,
or even in overkill,

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.967
To make it very stereotypical
so that people couldn't miss

01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:42.067
What it was.

01:11:42.067 --> 01:11:47.067
(Eerie music)

01:11:48.567 --> 01:11:51.133
There are a lotta questions
I have for Dylan and Cali,

01:11:51.133 --> 01:11:53.533
Especially Cali, who spent
more time here at the house

01:11:53.533 --> 01:11:55.967
Than anybody last week.

01:11:57.433 --> 01:12:00.533
Cali is, he just
left for rehab.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.400
He's in El Paso, or

01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:06.767
Georgia, I think.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.967
No no no, he's in
L.A. with friends.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.700
I'll get Dylan over here.

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:21.833
After probably a half an
hour or so, I walked out

01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:24.967
And I asked, "Is Dylan here yet?"

01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:27.667
"I haven't seen him," and I
just assumed that somebody

01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:29.767
Would let me know
when he showed up.

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:32.333
They said, "Yeah, he's
upstairs with Courtney,"

01:12:32.333 --> 01:12:33.700
Which I thought was strange.

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.233
He was supposed to be
coming in the house to talk

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:39.433
To me, not go upstairs and do
a pre-interview with Courtney.

01:12:40.067 --> 01:12:41.500
So there's just been a
couple things that have been

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.100
Eating at me in the last few
weeks, and I wanted to sit here

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.267
And I wanted to talk
to you about them.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.567
Did you just shoot up?

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:52.467
[Dylan] Hm?

01:12:53.067 --> 01:12:54.633
[Tom] Did you just shoot up?

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.300
Yeah.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.367
[Tom] What?

01:12:58.367 --> 01:12:59.867
Yes.

01:12:59.867 --> 01:13:01.367
Why did you do that?

01:13:01.367 --> 01:13:02.267
I told you I was coming
up here, I told you we had

01:13:02.267 --> 01:13:04.100
To have this conversation.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:05.433
Dylan.

01:13:05.433 --> 01:13:06.900
Hm?

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.100
[Tom] I told you we had
to have this conversation.

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:10.867
I'm ready.

01:13:10.867 --> 01:13:12.067
[Tom] You're ready?

01:13:12.067 --> 01:13:13.267
- Mm hmm.
- [Tom] You're not ready.

01:13:13.267 --> 01:13:14.633
[Tom] I felt, "Why
would Courtney do this?"

01:13:14.633 --> 01:13:17.300
She knew I had some serious
questions to ask him,

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.400
And she's sending him down
to me in a drugged state

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.133
Of mind, where he
could hardly talk?

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:25.300
You check the front
door or the back?

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.100
Did you check the front
door or the back door?

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:27.867
Yeah.

01:13:27.867 --> 01:13:28.933
[Tom] Which door?

01:13:28.933 --> 01:13:30.200
Both.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.200
[Tom] Both doors. Did
you check the side door?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.367
No.

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:33.367
[Tom] You didn't
go to the side door?

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.600
I don't remember.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.533
[Tom] You don't remember.

01:13:35.533 --> 01:13:37.167
Did you go to the Greenhouse?

01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.333
[Dylan] No.

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:39.700
You didn't go
to the Greenhouse?

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.733
Dylan, Dylan, I
wanna talk about...

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.333
I wanna talk about
the Greenhouse.

01:13:48.933 --> 01:13:50.200
Dylan.

01:13:50.867 --> 01:13:52.267
Dylan was a heroin addict,

01:13:52.267 --> 01:13:54.933
And he needed a
source for heroin.

01:13:54.933 --> 01:13:59.267
Once Kurt Cobain was dead, his
source became Courtney Love.

01:13:59.267 --> 01:14:01.967
His loyalty became
Courtney Love.

01:14:02.967 --> 01:14:04.200
He was very dependent on her.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.567
We've since learned
that she paid his rent

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:09.067
For many, many years,
supplied the money

01:14:09.067 --> 01:14:12.567
For his heroin, and almost
everybody around Kurt.

01:14:12.567 --> 01:14:13.867
They were dependent on Courtney,

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:15.767
They were dependent
on Courtney's money.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.767
It's a waste of
time, waste of time.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:34.133
I felt it was my duty
to notify my client

01:14:34.133 --> 01:14:36.500
That I was starting to
dig into some directions

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.533
That she may not want
me to be looking into,

01:14:39.533 --> 01:14:42.233
But I was determined
to do it and I thought

01:14:42.233 --> 01:14:45.900
That she deserved to know
that I was going to do this.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.533
She got the message,
I'm sure, from that.

01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:52.967
I was insinuating
that I suspected her

01:14:52.967 --> 01:14:54.833
Of being involved in this.

01:14:55.667 --> 01:14:57.667
A few days after
that letter was sent,

01:14:57.667 --> 01:14:59.867
I got a phone call
from Courtney.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.167
She wasn't livid, she
wasn't even angry.

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:05.400
She didn't mention
the letter, in fact.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.900
I basically said I'm going to
continue with my investigation

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:11.633
With or without
your cooperation.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.633
Here's all you have
to do to bring this

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.767
To a quick end and solve
all of your problems.

01:16:34.467 --> 01:16:39.467
(Ominous music)

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:18.633
(Eerie music)

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.600
(Sad guitar music)

01:18:03.667 --> 01:18:05.833
Yes, hi, I'm looking for Kurt.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.533
Hello?

01:18:08.533 --> 01:18:13.533
(Sad guitar music)

01:18:23.233 --> 01:18:24.700
Hello?

01:18:26.233 --> 01:18:27.800
Yes, hi. Someone's gonna get
really fucked up over there

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.467
If I don't talk to Kurt.

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:34.300
Hi, this is Julie Bernstein.

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:36.867
I really need to speak
to my client Kurt.

01:18:36.867 --> 01:18:38.233
Get him on the fucking phone!

01:18:38.233 --> 01:18:43.200
(Sad guitar music)

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.167
Yes, yeah, thank you.

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:55.767
No, no problem.

01:18:56.533 --> 01:18:57.933
Yeah, Delta's fine.

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:02.933
(Sad guitar music)

01:20:49.967 --> 01:20:54.967
(Eerie music)

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:12.933
[Voiceover] with the 20th
anniversary approaching,

01:21:12.933 --> 01:21:15.833
Detective Mike Ciesynski
re-examined the case files

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:18.900
Of an assignment early
in his fledgling career,

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.333
The investigation into
the death of Kurt Cobain.

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.733
You can never really
realize what type

01:21:24.733 --> 01:21:26.867
Of conspiracy theorists
are gonna come out

01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:28.300
Of the woodwork.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.933
The amount of heroin that
he injected was 10 times

01:21:31.933 --> 01:21:35.600
What, normally,
anybody would've taken,

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.400
Even a heavy heroin user.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:41.967
I believe he gave himself a
fatal dose of black tar heroin.

01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:47.833
(Eerie music)

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.933
[Voiceover] Detective Mike
Ciesynski found four rolls

01:21:53.933 --> 01:21:56.733
Of undeveloped
crime scene photos.

01:21:56.733 --> 01:21:59.067
Two of those photos
were released,

01:21:59.067 --> 01:22:01.367
Taken the day his
body was found.

01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:04.567
In hindsight, I think I
would've developed the film.

01:22:04.567 --> 01:22:05.967
[Voiceover] Did you
find anything different

01:22:05.967 --> 01:22:08.367
That made you believe
it's anything but suicide?

01:22:08.367 --> 01:22:09.767
No, nothing.

01:22:09.767 --> 01:22:12.133
What are people gonna
gain from seeing pictures

01:22:12.133 --> 01:22:13.333
Of Kurt Cobain?

01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:15.233
How is that gonna
benefit anybody?

01:22:15.233 --> 01:22:18.200
It wasn't gonna change
my decision that
this was a suicide,

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.667
And actually I'm the one who
makes the decision finally,

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:22.067
Do we go forward or not.

01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:25.400
There is never one item
that I said definitely

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.767
That this actually
was suicide, but um...

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.300
Any re-examination
should not even be actively

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.800
Participated in by the
Seattle Police Department.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.533
To expect them to conduct
an objective, detached,

01:22:54.533 --> 01:22:57.300
Unbiased investigation,
come back 20 years later

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.833
And say, "Hey man, we blew it?"

01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:03.800
It flies in the face
of common sense.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.900
The Kurt Cobain death
demands a re-opening

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:12.467
By an objective set of experts,
and until that is done,

01:23:12.467 --> 01:23:15.433
Then one cannot feel
comfortable in saying

01:23:15.433 --> 01:23:20.333
That Kurt Cobain's death
was a clear-cut suicide.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.233
(Eerie music)
(Rain)

01:23:27.233 --> 01:23:29.333
For me, the most
compelling piece of evidence

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:33.067
That convinces me,
almost to a certainty,

01:23:33.067 --> 01:23:36.100
That Kurt was murdered, was the
level of heroin in his body.

01:23:37.667 --> 01:23:40.333
There's never been a
documented case in the history

01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:43.367
Of law enforcement where
somebody could have

01:23:43.367 --> 01:23:47.100
The level of heroin in
their body that Kurt did,

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:51.833
Still remain conscious,
and still led to a suicide.

01:23:53.467 --> 01:23:56.367
We talked to an FBI
expert, and he said,

01:23:56.367 --> 01:23:58.667
"If you wanna get
away with murder,"

01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.167
"You kill a junkie."

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:06.167
It's very easy to
make a murder look

01:24:06.233 --> 01:24:09.400
Look like an accidental
overdose or a suicide.

01:24:10.067 --> 01:24:14.467
It's the perfect crime, and
it happens all the time.

01:24:16.067 --> 01:24:20.700
We know that Kurt and Courtney
had a prenuptial agreement.

01:24:21.533 --> 01:24:23.467
They were in the process
of getting a divorce.

01:24:23.467 --> 01:24:26.067
This was confirmed,
they were divorcing.

01:24:26.067 --> 01:24:27.867
He was leaving her.

01:24:28.467 --> 01:24:30.467
If the divorce had gone through,

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.267
She would've received
a very small settlement

01:24:34.267 --> 01:24:36.633
As a result of the
prenuptial agreement.

01:24:37.133 --> 01:24:41.067
When he died, she
co-inherited an estate worth

01:24:41.067 --> 01:24:44.233
Possibly more than a billion
dollars in future royalties.

01:24:45.067 --> 01:24:47.433
Police immediately
look at motive.

01:24:47.433 --> 01:24:48.900
Here's the motive.

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:54.667
No matter what anybody
believes, this happened

01:24:54.667 --> 01:24:58.533
Far too quickly for the kinds
of things to be accomplished

01:24:58.533 --> 01:25:03.267
That need to be done in this
kind of death investigation.

01:25:03.267 --> 01:25:07.633
We should, in fact, have
taken steps to study patterns

01:25:07.633 --> 01:25:12.633
Involved in the behavior of key
individuals who had a motive

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.800
To see Kurt Cobain dead.

01:25:16.767 --> 01:25:20.367
This would be in fact, a
classical example for how

01:25:20.367 --> 01:25:23.067
An investigation
should not be done.

01:25:23.067 --> 01:25:26.900
If, in fact, Kurt Cobain
was murdered, as opposed

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.900
To having committed
suicide, and it was possible

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:34.367
To learn that, shame on
us for not doing that.

01:25:34.367 --> 01:25:37.167
That was, in fact,
our responsibility.

01:25:37.167 --> 01:25:40.200
Should the case be re-opened?

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.067
My answer is unequivocally,
unhesitatingly,

01:25:43.067 --> 01:25:45.667
"Yes, the case
should be re-opened."

01:25:45.667 --> 01:25:47.433
It's about right and wrong.

01:25:47.433 --> 01:25:51.633
It's about honor,
it's about ethics.

01:25:51.633 --> 01:25:53.400
If we didn't get it
right the first time,

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.233
We damn well better get
it right the second time.

01:25:56.233 --> 01:25:58.267
And I would tell you right
now that if I were the

01:25:58.267 --> 01:26:01.667
Chief today, I would
re-open this investigation.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:12.100

(Eerie music)

01:26:32.767 --> 01:26:37.767
