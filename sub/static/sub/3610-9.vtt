00:02.003 --> 00:03.914
[man] Previously on Lost:

00:04.005 --> 00:08.339
Miles here and three of his people
came to the island about a week ago.

00:08.426 --> 00:11.418
Share with us exactly why they're here.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.627
We're here for him.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.758
How soon do we turn him over?

00:14.849 --> 00:16.134
We can't turn him over.

00:16.225 --> 00:20.264
Once they have me, their orders are
to kill everyone else on the island.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.345
He won't tell us his spy on the boat.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.680
lt's Michael.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.934
Pull!

00:25.026 --> 00:26.641
[machine gun fire]

00:26.736 --> 00:29.022
- What are you guys doing?
- Shooting things.

00:29.113 --> 00:31.525
This is a map to the temple.
It's a sanctuary.

00:31.616 --> 00:34.779
It may be the last safe place.
Leave now, you can get there

00:34.869 --> 00:37.781
in a day and a half.
Your mother will protect you.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.368
[whizzing sound]

00:42.293 --> 00:43.874
[gunshoﬂ

00:43.961 --> 00:46.213
- Karl! No!
- Come on.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.538
- Come on. Come on, he's gone.
- No!

00:48.633 --> 00:49.793
[gunshoﬂ

00:50.801 --> 00:53.053
[whimpering]

00:53.638 --> 00:56.380
Wait, wait, don't! l'm Ben's daughter!

00:56.474 --> 00:58.214
l'm his daughter!

01:37.765 --> 01:39.972
You got a prescription for that?

01:40.518 --> 01:43.555
Yeah. Wrote it myself.

01:49.527 --> 01:50.607
You look terrible.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.856
Well, thanks.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.525
What are those?

01:57.326 --> 02:01.035
Antibiotics. ljust got a stomach bug.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.909
You should eat some crackers.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.328
Crackers always make me feel better.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.462
Why aren't they back
from the boat yet, Jack?

02:17.596 --> 02:19.461
Sayid said the engine was down.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.172
My guess is they're fixing it

02:21.267 --> 02:24.509
and wondering why the hell
they can't get in touch with us.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.389
- And you're not worried?
- No.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.062
My gut says we're getting off
this island.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.640
I thought your gut was sick.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.153
[Vincent barking]

02:33.237 --> 02:36.604
[man] Help! I need some help! Help!

02:38.242 --> 02:41.826
Help! I need help!
I need some help down here!

02:48.836 --> 02:51.669
The dog was barking. I didn't see him.

02:51.756 --> 02:54.247
- Give me a hand.
- All right, I got him.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.031
Do you know who this is?

03:22.328 --> 03:23.784
He was on our boat.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.121
He's the doctor.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.578
We're all gonna die.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.708
Calm down, Chicken Little.
The sky ain't fallin' just yet.

03:38.803 --> 03:42.136
This is exactly what he wants,
to fight amongst ourselves.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.090
- You're making a big mistake.
- It's his to make, Hugo.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.812
Let's get on with it.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.397
Right.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.777
l'm attacking Siberia.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.577
- Sorry.
- Can't believe you gave him Australia.

04:06.664 --> 04:10.031
- Australia's the key to the whole game.
- Says you.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.255
[girl crying]

04:17.508 --> 04:19.840
[man] Stop here. On your knees.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.502
Get on your knees.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.845
Hey, turn this thing off.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.267
Please.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.729
There's a baby with them.
Just promise you won't...

04:41.824 --> 04:44.190
Turn the fence off.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.076
OK. lt's off.

04:56.172 --> 04:58.584
[phone rings]

05:05.347 --> 05:07.554
[ringing continues]

05:10.686 --> 05:13.894
- [beep]
- [female voice] Code 14-J.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.599
Code 14-J. Code 14-J.

05:17.693 --> 05:21.811
- Who is it?
- I think it's for Ben.

05:21.906 --> 05:24.067
[classical music on piano]

05:35.169 --> 05:36.534
[door opens]

05:39.882 --> 05:41.998
What's code 14-J?

05:43.469 --> 05:46.256
- Where did you hear that?
- Phone rang, I picked it up.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.759
A voice kept repeating "code 14-J."

05:50.893 --> 05:54.602
We need to get to the other house.
Better position on the tree lines.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.430
- What are you talking about?
- They're here.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.287
[gasps]

06:42.444 --> 06:44.696
[retches]

07:06.010 --> 07:07.966
[man shouting in foreign language]

07:08.387 --> 07:09.376
Hello.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.097
[cocks gun]

07:14.184 --> 07:15.344
No, no, no, wait.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.183
Wait, I can explain.
Do you speak English?

07:26.030 --> 07:27.520
[speaks foreign language]

07:48.886 --> 07:51.423
- [metallic clinking]
- Ah, OK.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.300
OK, OK. OK.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.013
[horse whinnies]

08:03.734 --> 08:07.101
- Surrender! Surrender!
- Oh, so you do speak English.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.542
Hyah!

08:33.722 --> 08:37.180
Let me guess, 14-J ain't the code
for the pizza boy.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.599
It's an early warning system.

08:39.687 --> 08:40.972
Warning for what?

08:41.063 --> 08:44.055
Someone tripped the panic switch
at our security fence.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.014
One of my people has been captured.

08:46.110 --> 08:50.274
How long did you guys debate amongst
yourselves to ask me why the phone rang?

08:50.364 --> 08:54.152
- Five minutes.
- Well, so much for our head start.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.201
Hold up. I gotta grab
Frenchie and the kids.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.871
They're safe. I sent Rousseau,
Alex and Karl away yesterday.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.118
Away where?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.377
Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'.
l'll grab her.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.500
- There's no time.
- I'll make time.

09:10.592 --> 09:14.176
It's very important you survive
what's about to happen here, John.

09:14.263 --> 09:17.426
- I need you to stay close to me.
- And why would I do that?

09:17.516 --> 09:20.098
The people that are coming
won't risk hurting me.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.722
You want to live?
I'm your best chance.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.309
His throat was slit.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.110
You know anything about that?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.070
No.

09:38.162 --> 09:40.904
- He was fine when | last saw him.
- Which was when?

09:40.998 --> 09:42.738
"When"...

09:42.833 --> 09:45.666
"When" is kind of a relative term.

09:49.423 --> 09:53.336
- We don't know anything about this.
- Any luck fixing the sat-phone?

09:54.303 --> 09:55.918
Uh, yes, sorry, no...

09:56.013 --> 09:58.174
The mike was smashed up pretty good.

09:58.265 --> 10:02.099
Best case scenario, we'd only be able
to broadcast tone squelch.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.221
Beeps and boops.

10:03.312 --> 10:06.896
Yeah, but you could still use it
as sort of a telegraph, right?

10:06.982 --> 10:09.439
If I had some strips of ferrous metal,

10:09.526 --> 10:13.860
uh, a nine-volt battery clip
and some wiring...

10:13.947 --> 10:16.689
We got a bunch of stuff
we salvaged from the plane.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.241
- Great.
- I'll show you where it is.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.741
Bernard, you got a second?

10:33.258 --> 10:35.715
These people,
you're scared of them, aren't you?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.384
That's right, John. I am.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.052
[Aaron cries]

10:39.139 --> 10:40.675
What's going on?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.892
Get away from the window, Hugo.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.809
- How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
- He's not.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.732
Hey! You see if Claire
left her house this morning?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.910
- Why do you have that?
- Get back inside and wait until...

11:02.996 --> 11:04.497
[gunshoﬂ

11:07.209 --> 11:08.949

11:09.044 --> 11:10.454

11:11.922 --> 11:13.708

11:25.435 --> 11:26.470

11:37.531 --> 11:39.021
Claire!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.294
Claire!

11:52.629 --> 11:55.371
[people chattering]

12:11.565 --> 12:14.728
- Good afternoon, sir.
- I'd like a room, please.

12:14.818 --> 12:18.857
Of course, sir. Is this
your first time in Tunisia?

12:20.866 --> 12:23.198
No. But it's been a while.

12:24.578 --> 12:28.070
- Your name?
- I'm actually a preferred guest.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.157
It should be under Dean Moriarty.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.500
Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.

12:44.890 --> 12:49.600
- May | help you with anything else?
- Yes. Today's date is...?

12:49.686 --> 12:52.849
- October 24th, sir.
- 2005?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.853
Yes, sir. 2005.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.226
Thank you.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.240
...Sayid Jarrah...

13:13.335 --> 13:16.122
Please, / just want to bury
my wife in peace.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.476
Right now, I need you to tell me
what's going on.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.179
I think the technical term
is "shock and awe."

13:36.274 --> 13:38.481
Trying to frighten me into surrendering.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.231
- Why did they stop shooting?
- Was that Claire's house?

13:42.823 --> 13:45.781
- Claire was there.
- Get the baby away from the window.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.116
Put him in the back room.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.993
You said I need to survive this. Why?

13:54.084 --> 13:57.576
Because there's only one person
that can help us, that's Jacob.

13:57.671 --> 14:01.334
- We have to go to him together.
- What makes you think I can find him?

14:01.425 --> 14:03.916
- I don't even know where the cabin is.
- I know.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.758
But Hurley does.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.097
Claire! Claire!

14:10.934 --> 14:12.344
Claire!

14:17.107 --> 14:18.187
Claire.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.276
Are you OK?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.814
- Charlie?
- OK, OK, OK.

14:26.908 --> 14:30.526
- Where's Aaron?
- He's with us. We're gonna move now.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.700
Let's go.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.074
[Aaron cries]

14:39.880 --> 14:41.962
[Sawyer] Open the front door!

14:49.723 --> 14:52.009
Hugo, you don't want to do that.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.726
Open the damn door!

14:58.148 --> 15:02.061
Open the door! Open the damn door!

15:11.328 --> 15:14.161
- Careful, careful.
- Is she all right?

15:14.247 --> 15:17.080
She got her bell rung,
but she's gonna be all right.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.750
They just started shooting. Why?

15:26.134 --> 15:28.967
Why slaughter people without
telling us what they want?

15:29.054 --> 15:31.261
They were murdered
to make you angry,

15:31.348 --> 15:34.511
so you'd be more likely to storm in
and throw me to the wolves.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.637
Yeah? What's wrong with that?

15:36.978 --> 15:39.811
Sounds like a great plan to me.
What do you say, on three?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.816
[doorbell rings]

15:47.531 --> 15:50.022
- I wouldn't if I were you.
- Shut up!

16:07.968 --> 16:09.299
Miles?

16:12.013 --> 16:14.504
- Who let you out?
- The people who gave me this.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.181
They want to talk.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.816
[women crying]

16:26.903 --> 16:29.565
[man chanting in foreign language]

16:29.656 --> 16:32.238
[people chanting]

16:41.918 --> 16:44.250
- [man] Step over here.
- [man #2] Where? Where?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.838
Right over here.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.923
[chanting continues]

17:27.130 --> 17:28.631
[shutter clicks]

18:02.624 --> 18:04.956
You vultures. You follow me to Tikrit?

18:05.043 --> 18:06.874
You spy on me?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.207
What are you doing here?

18:14.844 --> 18:17.381
I'm here to find the man
who murdered your wife.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.392
How did you get here?

18:28.483 --> 18:31.896
I came across the Syrian border.
It's not as difficult...

18:31.987 --> 18:35.525
- How did you get off the island?
- Your friend Desmond had a boat.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.446
Remember the Elizabeth?

18:37.534 --> 18:40.321
I followed a heading to Fiji.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.528
Then I chartered a plane.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.701
Why now?

18:47.544 --> 18:50.081
Remember the name
Charles Widmore, don't you?

18:51.506 --> 18:55.419
He tried to convince the world your
plane was on the bottom of the ocean?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.126
What does it have to do with me?
With Nadia?

18:58.221 --> 19:00.303
There was a man at her procession.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.802
He's one of Widmore's men.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.648
Bakir was last seen five days ago.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.980
In Los Angeles.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.156
Caught by a traffic camera
speeding away

19:17.240 --> 19:20.198
from the corner of La Brea
and Santa Monica.

19:24.873 --> 19:28.081
That's three blocks
from where Nadia was killed.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.292
Why would these people
want to murder her?

19:39.387 --> 19:40.672
I don't know.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.717
But they did.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.895
How many of them are there?

19:59.366 --> 20:03.029
- Maybe six. I'm not sure.
- The hell you mean you ain't sure?

20:03.119 --> 20:06.703
- You came over on the same boat.
- They told me they were security.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.497
- Security for what?
- For him.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.826
Once they got him,
to escort him back to the mainland.

20:12.921 --> 20:16.163
Miles, sounds like you
won't collect your $3.2 million.

20:18.301 --> 20:21.259
- Just take it.
- Why would I talk to them?

20:21.805 --> 20:25.889
- Because they have a hostage.
- They've badly miscalculated.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.717
All of my people
are prepared to die for this island.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.178
It's your daughter.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.445
Hello.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.746
- [static]
- [man] Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?

20:53.837 --> 20:55.202
That's right.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.960
My name is Martin Keamy.
I’m an employee of Charles Widmore.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.133
- Who's Charles Widmore?
- Later.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.461
I’d like you to go look out
your east window

21:04.556 --> 21:06.763
so we can talk about this face to face.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.430
To the left.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.107
You see me?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.776
Yeah, I see you.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.402
All right, Mr. Linus,
these are my terms.

21:24.492 --> 21:28.781
You’ll step out the front door, your
hands above your head, walk to me.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.113
Once I have you in my custody,

21:31.207 --> 21:34.699
then I promise you that no one else
in that house will be harmed.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.501
You and I both know, once you have me,

21:40.592 --> 21:44.585
there's nothing to stop you from killing
everybody else on this island.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.419
What kind of guy do you think I am?

21:47.432 --> 21:51.391
Martin Christopher Keamy, former
first sergeant, US. Marine Corps.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.641
Served with distinction 1996 to 2001,

21:54.731 --> 21:58.315
but since then worked with a number
of mercenary organizations,

21:58.401 --> 22:00.141
specifically in Uganda.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.318
So I know exactly what kind of man
you are, Mr. Keamy,

22:05.408 --> 22:07.694
and we can dispense
with the formalities.

22:09.579 --> 22:13.037
OK, Ben, you got it.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.159
[whistles]

22:15.251 --> 22:18.243
[whimpering]

22:23.968 --> 22:25.469
- [cocks gun]
- Get down.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.182
Get your ass out here right now...

22:39.317 --> 22:41.478
...or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.619
I'd like to present a counter-proposal.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.290
I’m listening.

23:02.632 --> 23:06.375
You and your friends,
you turn around,

23:06.469 --> 23:08.630
walk back to your helicopter,

23:08.721 --> 23:12.589
you fly away and forget
you ever heard of this island.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.141
Tell your daddy goodbye.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.442
Dad? They're serious.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.694
They killed Karl...

23:30.785 --> 23:32.946
...and my mother.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.699
Alex? I have this under control.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.327
Everything's gonna be OK.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.329
Please, Daddy!

23:41.337 --> 23:43.043
Please.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.582
You have ten seconds, Ben.

23:47.677 --> 23:50.214
- OK, listen.
- Nine...

23:51.222 --> 23:52.803
She's not my daughter.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.175
Eight...

23:54.267 --> 23:57.259
I stole her as a baby
from an insane woman.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.512
She's a pawn, nothing more.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.436
She means nothing to me.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.982
I'm not coming out of this house.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.283
So if you want to kill her,
go ahead and...

24:42.398 --> 24:43.478
I don't see him.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.145
They left her body there,
disappeared into the jungle.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.067
[Locke] They won't be gone for long.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.443
It's gonna be dark in 20 minutes,
and then they'll come for him.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.235
[Sawyer] Then let's just hand him over.

24:58.498 --> 25:02.582
[Locke] I don't think these people
intend to let us walk out here alive,

25:02.669 --> 25:06.332
- no matter what we do.
- I ain't got no intention of dying.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.414
He changed the rules.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.795
What? Who?

25:13.930 --> 25:15.261
What rules?

25:22.271 --> 25:26.605
You know I'm right. Our best chance
is to toss him out, fend for ourselves.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.227
Hey!

25:30.905 --> 25:32.065
Where are you going?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.115
Open this damn door!

25:37.704 --> 25:39.160
Open up!

26:30.673 --> 26:33.255
[men shouting]

27:01.329 --> 27:02.865
Walk.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.877
Who are you
and why are you following me?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.625
My name is Benjamin Linus.

27:16.344 --> 27:20.087
And I need you to take a message
to Mr. Widmore for me.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.092
And what message is that?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.936
- [muffled gunshot]
- [bullet shell clinking]

27:34.237 --> 27:37.149
[clicking, empty]

27:38.241 --> 27:39.777
That should do it.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.618
Wait!

27:45.498 --> 27:47.284
Where do you think you're going?

27:48.084 --> 27:49.949
We're finished here, Sayid.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.494
Turn around and walk away.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.545
Mourn your loss, get on with your life.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.339
l have no life.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.927
They took it from me.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.047
Go home, Sayid.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.676
Once you let your grief become anger,
it will never go away.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.134
I speak from experience.

28:09.897 --> 28:12.104
This is my war. It's not yours.

28:15.778 --> 28:21.114
I spent the last eight years of my life
searching for the woman I love.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.534
I finally found her and I married her.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.785
Then I buried her yesterday.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.868
So don't tell me this is not my war.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.542
Benjamin...

28:43.139 --> 28:44.629
...who's next?

28:47.768 --> 28:49.099
I'll be in touch.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.527
[Sawyer] Open the damn door!

29:00.615 --> 29:04.358
The son of a bitch just left us here.
Open the damn door!

29:04.452 --> 29:05.817
What's going on?

29:05.912 --> 29:06.901
Claire?

29:09.123 --> 29:13.207
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah. Bit wobbly, but I'll live.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.785
- I wouldn't be too sure about that.
- [clang]

29:19.050 --> 29:20.460
Excuse me, James.

29:20.718 --> 29:21.707
Excuse you?

29:24.847 --> 29:28.465
- What were you doing in there?
- Listen to me very carefully.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.595
I need all of you to do
exactly as I say.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.678
In a minute we have to run
from this house as fast as we can.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.855
At that moment, when I give the order,

29:35.942 --> 29:38.308
I want you to head straight
for the tree line.

29:39.028 --> 29:41.269
You mean towards the guys with guns?

29:41.364 --> 29:44.902
No. We want to be as far away
from them as possible.

29:46.202 --> 29:48.534
[rumbling]

29:53.376 --> 29:55.116
[glass shattering]

30:10.977 --> 30:13.093
OK, outside! Outside now!

30:18.901 --> 30:20.402
[moaning]

30:20.486 --> 30:23.569
- [man] Fall back!
- [low growling]

30:23.656 --> 30:25.942
[gunfire]

30:31.497 --> 30:33.488
What did you do?

30:37.753 --> 30:39.618
Did you just call that thing?

30:39.714 --> 30:42.501
- [moaning continues]
- [men scream]

30:48.264 --> 30:50.755
[screaming]

30:54.437 --> 30:55.517
[man] Fall back!

30:55.604 --> 30:57.014
Go! Go, go!

30:58.774 --> 31:01.641
- Head for the creek. l'll catch up.
- Where are you going?

31:02.862 --> 31:05.399
l have to say goodbye
to my daughter, John.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.748
[noises fading]

31:46.322 --> 31:49.155
[cries]

32:04.715 --> 32:07.297
[clicking]

32:11.138 --> 32:13.345
I can't believe it.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.847
I actually have a signal.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.850
What are you sending?

32:20.689 --> 32:25.774
- [tapping Morse code]
- "What happened to...

32:25.861 --> 32:29.399
...the... doctor?"

32:34.537 --> 32:36.994
[Morse code beeping]

32:54.932 --> 32:56.672
[beeping stops]

32:56.767 --> 33:00.555
OK. They didn't exactly say
what happened to the doctor,

33:00.646 --> 33:05.265
but your friends are fine, helicopter's
coming back in the morning.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.902
- Well?
- He's lying.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.445
What the message said was,

33:11.532 --> 33:14.820
"What are you talking about?
The doctor is fine."

33:23.586 --> 33:24.871
You know Morse code.

33:28.591 --> 33:32.675
What does that mean?
"The doctor is fine"?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.262
I don't know.

33:35.306 --> 33:36.967
Why are you lying?

33:38.142 --> 33:42.602
Why did you say that the helicopters
are coming back?

33:44.857 --> 33:45.972
Jack.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.308
Were you ever...
gonna take us off this island?

33:55.743 --> 33:56.732
No.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.244
No.

34:08.589 --> 34:09.669
[groans]

34:09.757 --> 34:11.042
Jack.

34:31.195 --> 34:35.234
Think your chopper buddies
ran that way, if you want to catch up.

34:35.324 --> 34:38.066
Yeah, I think I'll stay
with you guys for now.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.327
[rustling]

34:42.414 --> 34:44.120
[both cock guns]

34:58.180 --> 35:00.262
Sorry about your daughter.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.349
Thank you, John.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.140
That being said, you lied to me.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.640
You told me you didn't know
what the smoke monster was.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.773
You can ask Jacob all about it
when we go to the cabin.

35:15.656 --> 35:18.318
Hang on. Jacob?

35:20.244 --> 35:21.734
Who the hell's Jacob?

35:22.454 --> 35:25.571
He's the man that's gonna tell us
what to do next, James.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.833
You know what?
I'm done with all this.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.458
Never should've followed you wackos
in the first place.

35:33.549 --> 35:37.258
I'm going back to the beach.
Claire and the kid are coming with me.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.585
- You good with that?
- [Aaron cries]

35:39.680 --> 35:41.796
Yeah. I'm good with that.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.346
[Miles] I'm coming with you.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.019
Let's go.

35:46.729 --> 35:48.685
You too, Hurley.

35:51.358 --> 35:52.518
[cocks gun]

35:57.656 --> 36:00.773
- Have you lost your mind?
- Hugo stays with us.

36:03.412 --> 36:04.401
[cocks gun]

36:05.914 --> 36:07.870
- Not a chance.
- Leave me out of this!

36:07.958 --> 36:10.495
I'm sorry, Hugo. We need you
to find the cabin.

36:10.586 --> 36:13.168
He ain't going anywhere with you,
son of a bitch.

36:13.255 --> 36:16.213
Stop! Put the guns down.
I'll go with Locke.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.915
- Hugo!
- It's OK, Sawyer.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.086
Please.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.170
Put your gun down.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.769
You too.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.514
You don't have to do this.

36:31.607 --> 36:34.644
You guys go to the beach.
l'll catch up sooner or later.

36:44.078 --> 36:47.286
You harm so much as one hair
on his curly head...

36:47.956 --> 36:49.617
...|'|| kill you.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.540
Fair enough.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.835
[Aaron cries]

36:59.468 --> 37:01.004
Let's go.

37:02.429 --> 37:03.669
Go, move!

37:15.025 --> 37:16.356
Which way?

37:22.366 --> 37:23.697
Follow me.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.168
Thank you.

37:45.514 --> 37:47.425
Good evening, sir. May | help you?

37:47.516 --> 37:50.303
Yes, I'm here to see
Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.

37:50.936 --> 37:54.224
- At this hour, sir?
- They're expecting me.

37:55.816 --> 37:57.977
Feel free to call up.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.644
No need, sir. Good night, sir.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.322
[elevator dings]

38:33.479 --> 38:35.344
[elevator dings]

38:57.628 --> 38:59.243
Wake up, Charles.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.803
I wondered when you
were gonna show up.

39:16.939 --> 39:21.182
- | see you've been getting more sun.
- Iraq is lovely this time of year.

39:23.946 --> 39:27.188
When did you start sleeping
with a bottle of Scotch by the bed?

39:27.282 --> 39:29.659
When the nightmares started.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.837
Have you come here to kill me,
Benjamin?

39:44.633 --> 39:47.340
We both know I can't do that.

39:49.263 --> 39:51.128
Then why are you here?

39:55.644 --> 39:58.852
I'm here, Charles, because
you murdered my daughter.

40:00.315 --> 40:04.183
Don't stand there looking at me
with those horrible eyes of yours

40:04.278 --> 40:08.021
and lay the blame for the death
of that poor girl on me,

40:08.115 --> 40:13.451
when we both know very well
I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.286
You did.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.574
No, that's not true.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.705
Yes, Benjamin, it is.

40:22.796 --> 40:26.254
You creep into my bedroom
in the dead of night,

40:26.341 --> 40:28.593
like a rat,

40:28.677 --> 40:32.169
and have the audacity to pretend
that you're the victim?

40:34.391 --> 40:36.473
I know who you are, boy.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.551
What you are.

40:39.438 --> 40:42.771
I know that everything you have
you took from me.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.645
So, once again | ask you...

40:50.532 --> 40:52.614
...why are you here?

40:53.785 --> 40:58.370
I'm here, Charles, to tell you
that I'm going to kill your daughter.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.746
Penelope, is it?

41:05.714 --> 41:08.000
And once she's gone...

41:09.468 --> 41:11.709
...once she's dead...

41:13.305 --> 41:15.921
...then you'll understand how I feel.

41:18.894 --> 41:21.385
And you'll wish you hadn't
changed the rules.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.193
You'll never find her.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.320
That island's mine, Benjamin.

41:36.411 --> 41:39.903
It always was. It will be again.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.286
But you'll never find it.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.246
Then I suppose the hunt is on
for both of us.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.130
I suppose it is.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.464
Sleep tight, Charles.
