00:01.669 --> 00:03.904
<i>Previously on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:06.140
The twins told us
you were gone half the night.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.709
-Well--
-We just wanted
to be alone to--

00:08.842 --> 00:10.678
Play cards and talk--

00:10.811 --> 00:11.879
And have our first kiss.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.947
<i>Look, I need your help.</i>

00:14.082 --> 00:15.183
Again?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.550
<i>All I bought us</i>
<i>was 10 minutes,</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:18.919
and that's now
officially run out.
You ready?

00:19.053 --> 00:20.054
<i>Is Harper here?</i>

00:20.188 --> 00:21.155
I think that
they've run off together.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.658
What if they're never found?
Like Savannah?

00:24.792 --> 00:27.228
We need to find out
what happened to Savannah
after the campfire.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.496
You were with her
last night, right?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.164
Isn't she
at her bunkhouse?

00:30.298 --> 00:32.100
They were with Savannah
last night at the dance.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.334
Now we run.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.104
Not so fast.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.038
Savannah!

00:38.172 --> 00:39.340
<i>The way you were</i>
<i>acting that day,</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:41.209
<i>it's like you knew something</i>
<i>the rest of us didn't.</i>

00:41.342 --> 00:42.676
None of this would be
happening right now

00:42.810 --> 00:44.278
if it hadn't been for you
and your stupid dare.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.380
Bennett,
<i>Unacceptable. I was with</i>
<i>an important client</i>

00:46.514 --> 00:47.948
when I heard that
a camper had disappeared.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.750
Dad, you're
not listening to me.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.120
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.088
Not...

00:54.222 --> 00:55.423
<i>another...</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:56.357
<i>word.</i>

00:56.490 --> 00:57.958
You heard that, right?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.493
My dad...

01:00.661 --> 01:01.929
He just confessed.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.098
♪**♪

01:07.501 --> 01:08.836
I don't get it.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.671
My dad and Savannah
were friends.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.306
Why would he hurt her?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.375
Maybe they were
pulling another prank

01:14.508 --> 01:15.443
and something went wrong.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.910
Like an accident?

01:17.044 --> 01:18.779
Better than the alternative.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.015
But we heard him confess.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.484
My dad said
it was all his fault.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.085
That has to mean
he did something to Savannah.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.920
Then why come back
to Sulphur Springs?

01:27.054 --> 01:28.021
It doesn't make sense.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.623
I thought you'd be glad
my dad confessed.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.858
It means your mom
is off the hook.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.260
My point is
we still don't know

01:32.393 --> 01:33.927
what actually happened
to Savannah.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.797
Yeah, we never will.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.266
My grandpa
made sure of that

01:38.399 --> 01:39.400
by getting my dad
out of town

01:39.533 --> 01:40.601
before anybody
could find out the truth.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.205
Well, we definitely
won't get any answers
sitting here.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.842
Hey, hey.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.644
-Help us!
-We need help over here!

01:50.778 --> 01:52.513
Come on, help us!
Come on!

01:57.851 --> 02:00.053
I can't believe
Griffin did all this
for a girl.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.622
So dumb.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.924
Yeah, but it's also
kinda romantic

02:04.057 --> 02:05.226
when you think
about it.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.760
They're like
Romeo and Juliet.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.430
-Who?
-Shakespeare?

02:09.563 --> 02:11.899
You really need
to pick up a book
now and then.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.367
I read books!

02:13.501 --> 02:14.868
Comics don't count.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.970
Anyway, it's a story
about a teenage couple

02:17.104 --> 02:18.772
whose families
keep them apart.

02:18.906 --> 02:19.773
How'd it end?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.676
Never mind. Bad example.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.617
It's coming
from over there.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.552
Think it's Savannah?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.588
We did feel
a cold spot in that room.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.424
Okay. Come on.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.892
-Wait!
-Shh.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.961
My hat.
It's upstairs.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.096

Another cop was taking us

to help search the lake.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.651
It's been a while.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.620
He probably forgot
we were in here.

03:39.753 --> 03:40.988
If you'll just
let us go...

03:41.121 --> 03:41.555

No, no.
We can't wait.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.694
It's an emergency.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.861
What kind of emergency?

03:48.762 --> 03:49.897

Really, really bad.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.067

What-- You think
he's headed to Chicago?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.126
All his friends are there.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.328
My sister, your dad.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.862
Makes sense he'd go
some place familiar.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.531
Mom!

04:23.664 --> 04:24.932
Savannah is haunting
the hotel.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.600

just cold spots.

this weird glare

So is this!

04:35.275 --> 04:36.910
I can't right now.
You deal with them.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.946
We aren't making this up.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.314

music playing

behind the wall.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.150

-It had to be Savannah.

explanation!

Uh, Griffin was...

04:58.466 --> 04:59.767
messing around
with an old recording

04:59.900 --> 05:01.335
when we were in there
the other day.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.607
Guess he must've left it on.
Mystery solved. No ghost.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.208
What?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.644
We'll be upstairs.
Let's go, Wyatt.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.620
Harper would freak
if she found out

05:19.753 --> 05:20.988
you were
going through
her stuff.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.390
Well, Harper
should've thought of that

05:22.523 --> 05:23.691
before she took off
with Griffin.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.594
Cold.
I like it.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.261
You're just
gonna stand there?

05:28.396 --> 05:29.597
What are we looking for?

05:30.731 --> 05:33.033
Anything that can help
the police narrow the search.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.335
Um, notes, receipts,
a journal.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.037
Oh, she keeps that
under her mattress.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.340
I'm guessing.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.391
And you complain
about how I spend
my allowance?

05:57.525 --> 05:58.826
Keep looking.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.477
Has Harper been going through
the boxes out in the garage?

06:17.277 --> 06:18.345
How would I know?

06:18.479 --> 06:20.047
Well, there's not much
that happens around here

06:20.180 --> 06:21.415
without you knowing about it.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.250
Or benefiting from it.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.153
-Valid point.
-Toph.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.488
Fine.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.322
Harper wanted
a picture of Dad,

06:29.457 --> 06:31.459
and I may have
told her where--

06:32.760 --> 06:34.728
-Grab your keys.
-Why?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.229
I think I know
where she is!

06:44.905 --> 06:46.740
Everything okay?

06:49.577 --> 06:51.278
Answer me
or I'm coming in.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.589
Come on.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.734
-Where are you going?
-Back to the hatch.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.736
To do what?
Confront your dad?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.571
Well, yeah, Harper.

07:17.705 --> 07:18.939
He confessed.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.107
I have to know why.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.975
What makes you think
he'll tell the truth now?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.977
Your dad's lied
over and over again.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.045
I mean, so have we.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.715
Even if we come clean
about everything,

07:27.848 --> 07:30.250
the bunker,
the portal, the past,

07:30.383 --> 07:31.652
no way our parents
will believe us,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.453
especially
after last night.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.422
So we just
go on with our lives?

07:36.590 --> 07:38.559
Act like my dad doesn't know
what happened to Savannah?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.460
I can't.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.062
What if there was
another option?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.567
We saw my mom
running out of the hotel

07:46.700 --> 07:48.168
right before
your dad confessed.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.170
You think Jess saw something?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.305
Only one way to find out.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.449
I know waiting
is hard,

08:02.583 --> 08:04.451
especially when
you're worried sick
about your friend.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.385
Savannah wasn't my friend.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.988
Police are asking us
to do another head count.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.823
Make sure no one else
is missing from camp.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.358
Sit tight.
I'll be back soon.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.166
What are you
doing here?

08:19.967 --> 08:22.903
Um, we saw
Ben's dad pick him up.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.272
I think they went
back to Chicago.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.406
Figured you'd
want to know

08:26.540 --> 08:28.075
since he didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.376
I don't care.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.644
Ben was a jerk.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.881
Because he spent more time
with Savannah than you?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.416
Wow.
Jump to conclusions much?

08:36.984 --> 08:38.418
You're just like Ben.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.287
I'm nothing like Ben.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.723
You're accusing me
of being jealous.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.257
He made accusations too.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.927
Blamed me for what happened
to Savannah.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.195
How come?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.364
I-- I dared her
to spend the night...

08:52.165 --> 08:53.166
alone in the basement.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.036
Hey, if Savannah
went through with it

08:56.169 --> 08:58.171
and got grabbed by a ghost,
it's her own fault.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.740
Wait.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.209
So, Ben wasn't with her?

09:02.342 --> 09:04.111
I'm done
talking about Ben.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.780
Leave...

09:06.914 --> 09:08.882
or I'll get Becky
back in here.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.483
We should go, Harry.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.252
Jess obviously wants
to be alone.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.663
If Savannah was in
the basement all night long,

09:22.796 --> 09:24.097
she would've had
plenty of time to look around.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.733
Maybe even find the bunker.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.300
She could be traveling
through time,

09:27.434 --> 09:28.736
just like us.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.711
Why would
your sister be here?

09:38.712 --> 09:39.813
'Cause Dad is.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.184
Harper visits
his grave a lot.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.419
Makes her feel close
to him, I guess.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.089
Do you visit?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.991
I've been here
with Harper before.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.425
It's not the same
for me.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.327
I don't really
remember Dad.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.363
Yeah, you were both
so little when he died.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.431
How come
you never talk about him?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.701
Well, it makes me sad

10:00.834 --> 10:02.402
to think about the life
we could've had together,

10:03.536 --> 10:05.472
the memories you and Harper
would have had with him.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.540
She remembers things
about him.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.409
Like what?

10:10.543 --> 10:13.046
Trips to the zoo,
painting on the porch,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.547
swimming in a lake.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.084
That kind of stuff.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.788
Why don't you go
look around for your sister?

10:22.690 --> 10:23.724
Harper will be okay, Mom.

10:25.693 --> 10:28.095
She's tough, like you.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.565
Thank you, baby.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.084
This has to be it.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.887
Savannah must have
found the portal.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.524
Look.
-Savannah could
easily fit through.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.027
Which means she could still
be alive somewhere in time.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.729
Explains why the police
never found her.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.431
Yeah, well,
it doesn't explain
why my dad confessed.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.199
I mean, if she's okay,

11:06.333 --> 11:07.801
why was he so upset?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.441
We don't know
if Savannah came
down here alone.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.443
It's possible
your dad knows
about the portal, too.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.546
He does act weird
every time he's
in the basement.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.448
Let's say they found
the portal together,

11:21.581 --> 11:23.751
but your dad decided
to stay behind.

11:25.052 --> 11:25.919
Camp was ending.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.354
He wouldn't see
Savannah again.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.256
That's reason enough
to be upset.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.424
I know, but think about
how my dad was as a kid.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.526
I mean, no way
he'd pass up
a chance to time travel.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.195
He'd be up
for the adventure.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.931
Unless Ben thought
it'd make things harder
for Savannah.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.135
What do you mean?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.471
Well, our parents
can be overprotective,

11:44.604 --> 11:47.040
but your grandpa
is super intense.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.676
If he found out
Ben was sneaking off,
he'd want answers.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.280
-And he wouldn't stop
until he found the portal.
-Exactly!

11:53.413 --> 11:56.016
So, my dad
might've confessed
to keep the secret...

11:56.149 --> 11:58.786
and make sure my grandpa
never came back
to Sulphur Springs.

11:58.919 --> 11:59.820
It's a good plan.

12:00.788 --> 12:01.955
Yeah.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.791
Was a good plan...

12:04.691 --> 12:06.526
until my dad
bought the hotel.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.362
Well, maybe he had
a pact with Savannah,

12:09.496 --> 12:10.663
to come back one day.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.248
Come on, Savannah.
What are you trying to tell me?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.886
We should be
searching for Griffin.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.487
Every minute counts.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.189
The police told us
to stay put.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.858
I can't just
wait around, Ben.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.192
Our son is missing!

12:39.326 --> 12:42.162
You think I like making calls
and checking social media?

12:42.295 --> 12:43.696
I want to be out there
looking too, Sarah.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.965
Instead, you're in here,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.834
looking for ghosts.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.939
Ben...

12:52.539 --> 12:53.740
What's going on?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.313
Talk to me.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.849
Please.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.488
There is something
you should see.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.460
That was our chance
to convince Mom and Dad
this place is haunted.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.661
They didn't want to hear it.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.330
Mom didn't,
but Dad was curious.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.966
He even looked
a little freaked.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.968
You gave up too soon.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.602
Griffin ran away, Wyatt.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.904
That has everyone freaked.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.572
We shouldn't
give Mom and Dad

13:25.705 --> 13:26.940
more to worry
about right now.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.043
What if he didn't run away?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.180
What if Griffin was taken?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.483
By Savannah?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.185
She has been trying
to communicate with us.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.654
Maybe she got fed up
because we didn't understand.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.791
Then we have to try harder.

13:44.925 --> 13:45.725
Easy for you to say.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.862
You're not walking around
with a bull's-eye on your head.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.731
Your hat?
That's what you're looking for?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.967
Savannah doesn't care
about your red hair, Wyatt.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.835
I was just
messing with you.

13:56.636 --> 13:57.837
It has to be
here somewhere.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.572
Wyatt, focus!

14:00.140 --> 14:01.374
Griffin needs us.

14:02.809 --> 14:03.643
You're right.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.913
We could be his only hope.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.292
Welcome
to Camp Tremont.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.661
Why are we here?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.264
I need you
to see this place.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.865
Maybe then
you'll understand

14:25.999 --> 14:27.700
why I had to come back
to Sulphur Springs.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.671
I loved
spending summers here
as a kid.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.607
Used to stay
in the bunkhouse
right over there.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.045
Swim in the springs,
pull pranks...

14:38.178 --> 14:40.680
I already know
all about the happy memories
you made at camp.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.484
I lied.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.355
Not all my memories here
were happy.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.757
Some are pretty awful.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.696
Looks the same.

14:56.829 --> 14:57.864
Maybe the portal
didn't work.

14:57.998 --> 14:58.798
I felt the jolt.

14:59.933 --> 15:03.503
Okay, assuming we can
bring Savannah back,
then what?

15:03.636 --> 15:06.206
She'll need a cover story
about where she's been,

15:06.339 --> 15:08.141
something that won't make
the police suspicious.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.178
Let Savannah
come up with that
on her own.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.014
Your stories lead
to awkward talks and
way too many questions.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.648
Is thank you
too much to ask?

15:15.782 --> 15:18.385
I did keep our parents
from finding out
about the portal.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.586
Our moms anyway.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.554
Well, we can't be sure
exactly what my dad knows

15:21.688 --> 15:22.655
until we find Savannah.

15:22.789 --> 15:23.923
Let's check
the bunkhouse first.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.526
Uh...

15:26.659 --> 15:28.195
Yeah,
she's not there.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.162
Why do you say that?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.064
Well, 'cause
the bunkhouses aren't.

15:34.734 --> 15:35.969
1960?

15:43.310 --> 15:44.911
The summer
Savannah went missing...

15:46.113 --> 15:46.980
I was here.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.017
-But you didn't know her.
-It's not true.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.119
We were friends.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.887
Good friends.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.190
Griffin was right.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.228
I should have been
honest when Griffin
first started asking

16:01.361 --> 16:02.829
about Savannah's
disappearance.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.465
And instead,
you got mad at the kids.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.735
Accused us of not giving
this place a chance.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.005
And all this time,
you've been keeping secrets.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.273
What happened to Savannah

16:13.406 --> 16:15.108
is not something I've ever
talked about with anyone.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.709
Not even Jess.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.512
Why would you talk
to Harper's mom?

16:21.848 --> 16:23.150
She went to camp here too.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.719
-Wait, what?
-Sarah...

16:29.189 --> 16:31.424
That's why she was telling me
to go back to Chicago.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.695
Jess knew
you were lying to us.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.468
Did she also know
about you buying the hotel
before I did?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.136
All right,
it's not like that.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.605
Jess and I lost touch
after that summer.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.407
Never thought
she'd still be living
in Sulphur Springs

16:47.540 --> 16:48.841
or that one day
our kids would be close.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.377
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell,
sorry to interrupt.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.611
K-9 unit just arrived.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.446
The handler's asking for
some of Griffin's clothes

16:53.580 --> 16:54.547
to help track his scent.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.819
It's gonna be okay.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.589
You don't know that.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.401
There's nobody here.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.002
The Tremont
hasn't opened yet either?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.337
This doesn't make sense.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.773
-The sign back there
said 1960, right?
-Yeah.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.243
Hotel's been in business
since 1944.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.678
There's a map of The Tremont
on the wall downstairs.

17:25.812 --> 17:26.846
The date's on it.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.715
Maybe the portal took us
further back in time.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.185
How? Whenever we went
through before,

17:32.319 --> 17:33.986
we always ended up
30 years in the past.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.823
And this time we came
from the hatch from 1990.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.226
So... where is everyone?

17:44.197 --> 17:45.832
Hey, what are y'all doing?

17:45.965 --> 17:47.900
Um... we're looking
for a friend.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.637
Uh, she's blonde,
about this tall.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.139
You're not gonna
find anybody here.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.340
Big storm's coming.
Everybody's gone.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.643
I'm only staying
long enough
to board up the windows.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.478
You two kids need
to get on home, okay?

17:58.611 --> 17:59.546
It's not safe here.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.117
Where else
would Savannah go?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.618
We don't have time
to look.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.719
I thought
you wanted answers.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.255
I do, but...

18:09.222 --> 18:10.290
What if we're wrong?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.159
I mean, what if Savannah
never found the portal?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.926
We can't risk
getting stuck here
for nothing.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.097
Wait. Someone's inside.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.668
Savannah!

18:21.801 --> 18:23.536
-Oh, there you are!
-Thank goodness.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.038
Hermione! Harry!

18:26.806 --> 18:28.208
Boy, am I glad
to see you.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.476
I almost started
to think

18:29.609 --> 18:30.910
I stepped into
"The Twilight Zone"
or something.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.712
All right, listen,
we don't have a lot of time.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.681
-This was Ben, right?
-What?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.583
Pulling one last prank
before camp ends?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.118
Talk about epic!

18:39.952 --> 18:42.054
He emptied out
an entire hotel.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.856
My dad doesn't know
about the portal.

18:44.757 --> 18:45.658
What?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.026
This isn't a prank,
Savannah.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.295
It's the past.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.696
1960, we think.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.431
That's why
things seem different.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.433
The past?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.534
Good one.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.106
All right, we need
to get back
to the hatch now.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.674
You guys can drop the act.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.710
Tell Ben to come out now.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.446
Look around.
The phone, the calculator,

19:06.579 --> 19:07.647
the guest book,

19:07.780 --> 19:09.316
it's all from another time.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.384
How could Ben
have possibly
pulled this off?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.854
His dad's rich.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.190
You really think
he'd ask his dad
for help with a prank?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.493
Probably not,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.430
but makes a lot more sense
than time travel.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.632
Please, Savannah.
I know it sounds crazy,

19:25.765 --> 19:27.467
but I really need you
to come with us.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.968
It could change everything.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.103
♪**♪

19:46.353 --> 19:47.787
What are you doing?

19:47.920 --> 19:50.590
Oh, uh, just looking
for a picture of your sister.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.559
Thought it might help
with the search.

19:56.863 --> 19:57.997
Mom...

20:04.937 --> 20:06.105
Did the police find them?

20:06.239 --> 20:07.574
They're asking
for clothes,

20:07.707 --> 20:09.476
something with
the kids' scent.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.577
I'll get it.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.954
I told Sarah
we knew Savannah.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.091
She had
a lot of questions.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.159
I'm sure.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.698
I've been over and over
that day in my head.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.101
And I keep coming back
to how weird you were acting,

20:35.234 --> 20:36.469
how you blamed me.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.637
I was upset.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.771
It was more than that.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.574
What really happened
that night, Ben?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.879
I tried being supportive,

20:47.013 --> 20:48.548
let Ben work through
his mid-life crisis,

20:48.681 --> 20:50.817
and now I find out
he's been lying.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.619
About everything!

20:53.420 --> 20:54.554
As soon as we find Griffin,

20:54.687 --> 20:56.689
I'm packing up the kids
and moving back to Chicago.

20:58.825 --> 20:59.926
Jenny?

21:00.059 --> 21:00.893
Hello?

21:01.861 --> 21:02.929
Can you hear me?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.085
Give me a hand with this.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.857
-You first.
-Okay.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.962
Savannah, hurry!

21:36.095 --> 21:37.063
I'm coming.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.565
Come on.
-Go!

21:44.103 --> 21:46.038
-Where's Savannah?
-She was right behind me.

21:57.684 --> 22:00.186
<i>Next time on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

22:00.319 --> 22:02.522
Savannah!
Hold on, we're coming.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.891
-Griffin, we have to go!
-The hatch is stuck.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.360
<i>The second we get back,</i>
<i>we'll check records from 1960.</i>

22:07.494 --> 22:08.661
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

22:08.795 --> 22:11.330
<i>I'm starting to believe</i>
<i>this place really is haunted.</i>

22:11.464 --> 22:12.532
Let's go. Now!

22:13.666 --> 22:16.135
Griffin, what's going on?
Why aren't you at school?

22:16.268 --> 22:17.370
<i>We have to go back.</i>
<i>Now.</i>

22:17.504 --> 22:19.071
<i>Harper, my family's moving.</i>
