to never respond.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.134

13:06.046 --> 13:08.352

13:10.485 --> 13:12.704

you're probably hearing

13:44.780 --> 13:47.087

13:47.130 --> 13:48.828
I know he's missing.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.047
Somewhere called Tunisia.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.397
Tunisia. That-- is
that how you say it?

13:53.441 --> 13:56.879
Yeah, I had to, I had to go and
look it up on the map myself.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.273
That's all I know.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.755
I should've sent Teena with him.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.804
I tell you what,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.154
we are gonna get
your daddy home safe.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.243
Okay?

14:13.287 --> 14:15.855
That's a promise
from Uncle Sonny.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.469
He told me about
when he got lost before.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.036
In the mountains.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.388
Hmm. Yeah.

14:27.431 --> 14:31.261
And he stayed strong
and we found him.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.222
Now, if we got to do
that again, we will.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.357
He told me it was a miracle
he was found in the mountains.

14:43.447 --> 14:46.363
You think people
get two miracles?

14:49.366 --> 14:54.241
If anybody does,
it's your daddy.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.117
Hang in there, okay?

15:02.858 --> 15:04.555
It's gonna be
all right.

15:08.559 --> 15:12.476
What in the hell
are we doing here, boys?

15:12.520 --> 15:15.827
We should be over there right
now kicking doors off hinges.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.960

15:18.004 --> 15:20.006
Not as Bravo.
You heard Blackburn.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.051
Really no chance
the team gets spun up?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.444
"Undeployable."

15:23.487 --> 15:24.619
It ain't right.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.968
Whether rescue or recovery,

15:26.012 --> 15:28.449
we should be the ones
bringing Ray home.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.103
Yeah, it should be Ray's
actual Bravo brothers

15:30.146 --> 15:31.278

Hey.

Not here, Sonny.Take your shots, Sonny,

15:37.414 --> 15:40.243

got us grounded hard.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.942
Hmm. Well, we can't
get off the runway

15:42.985 --> 15:44.987

ain't got no captain.That's enough.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.375
A canvass of all hospitals in
the region has not located Ray.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.029
We have alerted
local authorities

16:27.073 --> 16:29.031
while maintaining his cover.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.555
Intel is zeroing in
on the party responsible

16:31.599 --> 16:33.688
for the attack, so a task force,

16:33.731 --> 16:39.041
consisting of Alpha, Charlie
and Foxtrot teams will spin up.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.696
Ensign Davis and I have
been tapped to join it.

16:41.739 --> 16:46.614
Each of you will strap
with one of the teams...What?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.529
...assigned here.Our brother's missing,

16:48.572 --> 16:50.487
and Command's
playing temp agency.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.489
Foxtrot?

16:52.533 --> 16:54.665
Team's a clean-shaven,
uptight clown show.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.450
Back to Alpha.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.713
Back to Charlie for me.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.671

till it's gone, huh?

Parting out Bravo's Ferrari
for a fleet of Miatas.

17:03.761 --> 17:07.374
Okay, so it'll be on each one
of us to bring Ray back.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.941
Damn straight.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.075
I'm gonna head back.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.164
All right. I'm
gonna stick here.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.426
I mean, it's the
least I can do.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.080
Seems to be my
calling lately.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.995
Sucks not being
in the fight.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.431
Yeah, well, it sucks that
I put him over there.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.131
What do you mean by that?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.309
You know, if I hadn't taken
the hit for the Marsden letter,

17:29.352 --> 17:31.963
then Ray would never have made
warrant officer and he'd be here

17:32.007 --> 17:33.313
with his family.Yeah, he'd be unemployed.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.488
Don't ever question

17:34.531 --> 17:36.968
the moves you make, all right?

17:37.012 --> 17:38.144
He picked warrant officer

17:38.187 --> 17:39.493
because it was good
for his family.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.582
There's no way to know
the consequences.

17:41.625 --> 17:45.194
The fallout from the choices
that we make.

17:45.238 --> 17:48.589

if anything changes.
Yeah.

made it to Naima's.

Eh, it's all right,
she's in a fog,

18:07.564 --> 18:10.132
so your energy is best spent
here, hunting for Ray.

18:10.176 --> 18:14.049
You know, he's been doing
everything the right way.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.572
For his family,
for his career...

18:15.616 --> 18:19.054
And it is all gonna be
here when he gets back.

one of the fringe benefits.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.061
You know that.
Yeah.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.671
That's why when
we find something

18:27.715 --> 18:30.283
we can steal away
for ourselves...

18:32.241 --> 18:36.550

on to it as best we can.

No, no, this is different.
You understand?

I mean, Ray is missing,
or worse. He's...

19:01.618 --> 19:04.186

than ever right now,

to focus on that?
