00:03.703 --> 00:06.338
All right, quick review.
Yellow light means?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.107
Floor it.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.710
Stop sign?
Look both ways for johnny law,
then floor it.

00:11.712 --> 00:12.978
Yield sign means?

00:12.980 --> 00:14.179
Nothing to a Baxter.

00:14.181 --> 00:17.149
[ chuckles ]
let's stop right here.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.385
We're gonna go over
your parking technique.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.120
The third spot
from the end down there

00:21.122 --> 00:22.888
Is the last parking spot
you got,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.790
And you're trying to beat
a tree hugger in a hybrid.

00:24.792 --> 00:25.891
You got to be careful

00:25.893 --> 00:27.693
'cause you can't hear
those things coming.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.896
Just sit tight and suck in
the g-forces, old man.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.738
Whoo.
Okay,
a couple of things.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.341
I should have worn
a diaper today.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.542
[ chuckles ]

00:43.544 --> 00:44.977
And where did you learn
how to do that?

00:44.979 --> 00:47.913
I've had the world's
best driving instructor...

00:48.581 --> 00:49.882
..."grand theft auto."

00:49.884 --> 00:51.016
A video game.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.751
You know, in my day,
if you wanted to joyride,

00:52.753 --> 00:54.553
You had to actually
steal a car.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.056
Yeah, yeah. Life was rough
back then and so much better.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.824
Can we please get out
on the open road?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.160
Check the rearview mirror,
please.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.028
All right, all clear.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.930
No, there's still
something back there.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.432
Really? What?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.067
Your childhood.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.102
Now floor it.

Hey.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.525
No, none of that

01:33.527 --> 01:35.461
I got to get you out of here
before my dad sees you.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.062
Why? Your dad loves it
when I come over.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.098
Because he loves
putting you to work --

01:39.100 --> 01:41.467
Cleaning the gutters,
pulling weeds,

01:41.469 --> 01:43.969
Scrubbing
the guest bathroom.

In fairness, Kyle does
most of the damage in there.

Hey, Kyle. Is that you?

No, Kyle's not here.
Run. Run, run, run. Run.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.211
Hey, mr. B.
Nice running.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.979
I busted one of the motor mounts
in the truck.

01:53.981 --> 01:57.950
It's a two-man job, but we can
make do with a man and a half.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.985
Uh, Kyle and I
are going to the mall.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.253
You'd rather
go to the mall with her?

You're not half
the half-man I thought you were.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.125
Well, uh, Mandy, honey,
if you want some company,

02:06.127 --> 02:07.092
I'll go to the mall
with you.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.927
I mean,
I could use a day of beauty.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.729
A day?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.932
Oh, ha ha ha.

Yeah, I'm repulsive,
but I'm the best you could do.

02:18.104 --> 02:19.471
No, really,
I need to get to the salon.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.943
Come on, honey.
My treat.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.111
Yeah, but Kyle and I
have plans.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.513
And they don't
involve an engine.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.515
Uh, well, actually,
they kind of do.

I'm not sure
he works there, though.

Mandy. Come on. Let's go.

Sorry, Mandy.
My heart wants to stay.

But whatever organ controls fear
is telling me to go.

You ready to hit the salon?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.305
Or I could find a pair
of tweezers

02:53.307 --> 02:55.474
And go pluck myself.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.476
Wow. That looks heavy.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.844
It is heavy.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.046
I want you to slide under
the car so if the chain breaks,

03:01.048 --> 03:02.814
The motor can land
on something soft.

Right-o.

Kyle, I'm kidding.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.019
I'm not gonna drop
the engine on you.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.987
What I want you to do
is grab the battery posts

03:08.989 --> 03:11.023

if there's a full charge.

You won't be when you hear
what I'm looking for.

Have you seen
a guinea pig?

Oh, no, I-I thought we might go
to the flea market.

Your new apartment
needs furniture.

I'll buy you a couch

Actually, I just came by
to get Boyd's backpack.

a guinea pig in here,

of a very rough heart-to-heart.

Ohh.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.089
Shoot. It's not there.

Oh, no snickerdoodle,
huh?

03:45.926 --> 03:47.526
That thing cost 30 bucks.
Ohh.

Boyd would notice

were smaller?

03:51.065 --> 03:53.065

for the bills.

version of bill buckner.

version of that guy, huh?

You know what, mom?

go to the mall,

'cause I am so fed up
with Kyle!

Oh, great. Great.
I'll get my, uh...

04:33.207 --> 04:36.108
Ready to go?
Yes. Bye, mom!

04:47.053 --> 04:49.888
Hi.

Am I so horrible
that nobody in my family

04:51.725 --> 04:53.125
Wants to hang out
with me?

04:53.127 --> 04:55.927
Put a little liverwurst
on your fingers.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.497
The dog will be
your best friend.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.132
No, I meant humans.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.600
Yeah?
Even at work.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.502
Yesterday I was talking
to dr. Pullman

About oxidizing
ventilated air methane

With a thermal flow

05:07.474 --> 05:09.107
Yeah, let me guess
how this story ends.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.676
She jumped out
her office window.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.078
You know what?
I get it. I get it.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.112
Geology is boring.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.915
You can't pin this
on geology.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.518
It's how you talk
about your work.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.119
Listen, you were talking
about trapped gas, right?

05:21.121 --> 05:23.288
Mm-hmm.
That should be hysterical.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.290
Listen,
tell you what.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.092
Let me clean up.
I'll get to this later.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.527
You and I will go out
and do something together.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.761
Yeah, we'll do
whatever you want to do.

Are you sure?
Yeah.

to a modern-art gallery.

I mean, what, do they lure you
in with all that free wine?

05:35.669 --> 05:39.037
Mm-hmm.
And you got to decide
which is the real toilet.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.272
Yeah, you laugh.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.107
All you had to do was say,
"not that one."

05:42.109 --> 05:43.542
Right.

05:45.712 --> 05:50.315
I hear Vanessa made you
sit through a french film.

05:50.317 --> 05:52.117
What was it about?

05:52.119 --> 05:54.052
It was
about three hours.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.220
Ah.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.657
A guy in a striped shirt
searching for something,

05:58.659 --> 06:01.460
Smoking a cigarette.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.995
Were the stripes vertical
or horizontal?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.564
Oh, uh, uh, vertical.

06:05.566 --> 06:09.167
Ah,
I haven't seen that one.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.002
I was thinking,
why is Vanessa

06:11.004 --> 06:13.004
Cutting into your "me" time
all of a sudden?

06:13.006 --> 06:14.840
Well, she usually does
girl stuff on the weekends

06:14.842 --> 06:16.641
With the older two, but Kris
has got her own apartment,

06:16.643 --> 06:19.845
Mandy's in college.
I got it. All right.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.847
So, you have Vanessa
bearing down on you,

06:21.849 --> 06:24.049
You lost your two best blockers,
you've still got Eve.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.751
Oh, no.
Hmm?

06:25.753 --> 06:28.553
Vanessa and Eve really
never clicked, you know?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.555
They don't like
the same kind of things.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.023
Oh.
Eve's more like you?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.158
You bet she is.
Oh?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.594
She enjoys doing stuff
that's interesting.

06:36.729 --> 06:37.896
Yesterday,
she slid the truck

06:37.898 --> 06:39.898
Into a tight j-turn
right into a 180.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.999
Damn!

06:41.001 --> 06:44.002
It was like being
in a springsteen song.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.170
Uh-huh? Wait a minute.
Now, why --

06:45.172 --> 06:47.439
Well, why don't you hand
that off to Vanessa?

06:47.441 --> 06:50.776
The driving lessons.
Let them bond over that.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.344
But teaching Eve
how to drive is fun.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.745
Put her
and Vanessa together

06:53.747 --> 06:56.114
Doing something
Eve enjoys doing.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.151
Otherwise, it'll be
<i>"au revoir, bons temps."</i>

07:00.553 --> 07:03.088
"goodbye, good times."

07:03.090 --> 07:05.791
That should have been
the name of that movie.

07:07.894 --> 07:10.462
Mandy:
Kyle, I'm serious.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.030
You've got to
start saying no to my dad

07:12.032 --> 07:13.231
When he asks you
to work around here.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.034
Or just pretend
that you're incompetent, okay?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.736
That's always worked
for me.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.704
Yeah,
but you're a natural at it.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.041
Hey, morning.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.443
Kyle, it smells like
something died under the house.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.811
Guess who's gonna go look
for it.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.045
Come on!

07:27.047 --> 07:29.948
And you can keep
whatever you find.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.284
Kyle, just say "no."

07:32.286 --> 07:33.919
Okay.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.153
Yes.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.825
I'm sorry.
I held out as long as I could.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.794
You're gonna need a hammer,
right?

07:42.796 --> 07:43.995
The dead one
probably had friends

07:43.997 --> 07:45.397
That are coming
to his funeral.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.236
Hey. Kyle's mine.
Get your own boyfriend.

07:52.071 --> 07:55.073
Hey, Mandy.
Good morning.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.175
Okay.
What's her problem?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.077
I think
she's mad at Kyle.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.313
He's been blowing her off
a lot lately.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.515
Well, hey,
let's hit the road.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.784
I just watched
"fast & furious 6" last night,

08:05.786 --> 08:07.986
And I'm all geeked up
to try some new moves.

08:07.988 --> 08:08.986
Hey,
a little change today.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.856
Your mom's gonna take you out
for your lesson.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.857
Huh?

08:11.859 --> 08:14.693
No phones,
check your mirror,

08:14.695 --> 08:18.063
And remember
the brake is your buddy.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.368
Am I being punished?

08:23.370 --> 08:27.005
Punished?
Didn't you hear your mother?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.641
She's got fun slogans.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.176
Slogans?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.044
Honey, come on, we're gonna have
a blast. Let's go. Come on.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.044
Go on, now.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.715
See how many smiles
per gallon you can get.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.625
Hey, Mike Baxter here
with "protect your nugget" week

08:46.627 --> 08:47.993
Here at outdoor man.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.795
You know, we sell helmets
for just about everything --

08:50.797 --> 08:53.798
Biking, mountain climbing,
kayaking.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.636
We'll even sell you a helmet
for fishing.

08:59.739 --> 09:04.175
[bleep] [bleep]
that knocked my hat off!

09:04.177 --> 09:07.178
But we don't sell any protection

09:07.180 --> 09:09.814
For the single
most dangerous thing we do --

09:09.816 --> 09:13.818
Sharing the road
with the American teenager --

09:13.820 --> 09:17.055
The reckless, inept,
and accident-prone.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.390
[ horns blares, tires screech ]

09:18.392 --> 09:21.259
But in all fairness,
they are texting.

09:24.363 --> 09:25.997
The problem is,
here in the United States,

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
We barely teach kids
how to drive.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.401
So the first time
they hit trouble,

09:29.403 --> 09:31.870
All they know how to do is slam
on the brakes and do this.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.872
[ tires screech ]
[ whimpers ]

09:33.874 --> 09:34.940
"o-m-g."

09:34.942 --> 09:38.944
When actually,
sometimes the safest thing to do

09:38.946 --> 09:42.380
Is apply a little accelerator
and drive through the problem.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.782
Here we go.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.983
[ engine revs ]

09:46.218 --> 09:48.787
[ bell dinging ]

09:51.023 --> 09:54.793
Ah, denmark --
famous for their giant dogs

09:54.795 --> 09:56.194
And breakfast pastries.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.462
And get this --

09:57.464 --> 10:00.265
The lowest automobile-injury
rate in the world.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.634
Why? Denmark?

10:02.636 --> 10:04.235
Because in order
to get a driver's license,

10:04.237 --> 10:05.870
A teenager in denmark
has to go through

10:05.872 --> 10:07.806
A grueling series
of road tests --

10:07.808 --> 10:09.207
Cornering at high speeds...

10:09.209 --> 10:11.076
[ tires screech ]

10:11.078 --> 10:12.611
There you go, sven. Good.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.647
...Skid control on icy roads.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.717
Now, those are some skid marks
you can be proud of.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.285
So before you give your kid
the keys to the car,

10:20.287 --> 10:23.121
Race on down to outdoor man
and get him a kayak.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.489
Maybe it will keep him
off the road.

10:24.491 --> 10:29.828
Or he could paddle it to denmark
and learn how to drive.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.902
Eve, honey, let's adjust
your grip on the wheel.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.471
Hands should be
at 10:00 and 2:00.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.905
There you go.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.242
But isn't it just as good
to have one knee at 6:00?

10:44.244 --> 10:47.412
Honey, keep your hands on
the wheel and watch your speed.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.582
Relax, mom,
you're in good knees.

10:50.584 --> 10:51.983
Honey.
[ sighs ]

10:51.985 --> 10:54.586
Look, I know your father taught
you all kinds of fun tricks,

10:54.588 --> 10:56.287
But you still have to
pass your test.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.556
Don't worry, mom.
I'll pass it.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.625
But first,
I got to pass this...

11:00.627 --> 11:03.161
[ horn honks ]
...Dumbass in this r.V.!

11:03.163 --> 11:05.797
I think that's the organist
from our church.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.033
Hey, drive it or park it,
mrs. Gaffney!

11:08.035 --> 11:10.802
Honey, honey!
Watch the road rage!

11:10.804 --> 11:13.538
Well, it isn't road rage
until you get out of the car.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.340
You know what?
That's it.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.541
You're not taking this
seriously.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.009
Pull over.
I'll drive us home.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.310
Come on.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.712
Oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.148
I think mrs. Gaffney
is pulling over, too.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.718
Now it's road rage.
[ stammering ]

11:27.486 --> 11:29.454
Hey, you got a problem,
lady?!

11:33.793 --> 11:35.493
I found the dead animal,
mr. B.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.561
Good work, Kyle.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.329
Yeah, I just had to
wrestle it away

11:38.331 --> 11:41.533
From the animal
that killed it.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.735
You know,
despite their cuteness,

11:43.737 --> 11:46.337
Raccoons
are kind of jerks.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.574
Kyle, I-I feel bad about
springing all these jobs on you.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.576
Yeah, I've been wanting to
talk to you about that.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.112
So from now on, I'm gonna be
telling you ahead of time.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.982
Tomorrow,
we're gonna reseal the driveway.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.552
And by "we," I mean you.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.487
I'll just stop by
and critique your job

12:02.489 --> 12:04.089
During the middle
of the day.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.058
I do love
the smell of tar.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.226
Good deal.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.662
But it's important to Mandy
that I grow a spine

12:10.664 --> 12:13.398
And start saying "no,"
so...

12:13.400 --> 12:15.100
No?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.535
Hold on.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.105
Mandy wants <i>you</i>
<i>to say no to</i> <i>me?</i>

12:20.107 --> 12:21.773
Boy, she doesn't get us,
does she?

12:21.775 --> 12:24.375
[ laughing ] yeah.

12:24.377 --> 12:28.179
I'm not entirely sure
I do, either.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.014
You know, Kyle,
it is important

12:30.016 --> 12:31.583
That you learn
how to say "no."

12:31.585 --> 12:33.785
I'm so happy
to hear you say that.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.588
To Mandy.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.390
You got me again,
sir.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.425
Whoa. Stop.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.227
Kyle,
did you just promise my dad

12:42.229 --> 12:44.062
That you'd do some other
stupid chore for him today?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.797
No, first thing
in the morning.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.532
Come on! Kyle.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.933
Okay.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.636
Mr. B., I-I can't do this stuff
for you anymore.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.638
Yes! I win!

12:53.640 --> 12:56.441
And your reward, Kyle -- you get
to take me shoe shopping.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.909
Now,
I want to get a true fit,

12:57.911 --> 12:59.978
So I might ask you to carry me
so my feet don't swell.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.914
Whoa, Mandy.
Hey, Kyle. Kyle, Kyle.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.916
You start carrying her
around a shoe store,

13:04.918 --> 13:08.119
You might as well get fitted
for a saddle.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.822
I have to start saying "no"
to both of you.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.090
You're saying no to me?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.558
Yes.
No.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.959
Yes.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.096
We always do what you want
to do, but no more, okay?

13:18.098 --> 13:21.232
Today, I would like
to go ride dirt bikes,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.067
And you are more than welcome
to join me,

13:23.069 --> 13:25.069
Especially if you have
two dirt bikes.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.008
Can you believe
the way he just spoke to me?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.242
Yeah,
that took guts.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.944
My respect
for that kid...

13:32.946 --> 13:34.412
Actually,
I have some now.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.981
Yeah.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.184
Me, too.
That was super hot.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.486
Kyle, wait for me!

13:42.521 --> 13:43.955
Oh,
thank god it's you.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.123
There was a 50-50 chance

13:45.125 --> 13:47.826
I'd be holding your dad
right now.

13:48.694 --> 13:49.994
Ugh.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.465
Hey. How did
the driving lesson go?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.201
Mom bailed.
What?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.137
It's okay to get drunk
<i>after</i> driving, right?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.205
What happened?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.106
Well, ask "10:00 and 2:00"
over here.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.075
As a driving instructor,
she's a zero.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.179
The good thing
is you gals had some laughs.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.547
You did
all the fun stuff

14:09.549 --> 14:11.549
And you left the boring stuff
for me to teach,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.952
Like laws
and how not to die.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.620
Dad taught me
all that stuff, too,

14:15.622 --> 14:17.322
But at least
he enjoys my company.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.823
I enjoy your company.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.726
Not at this moment particularly,
but I-I-I do.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.894
Just forget it, mom.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.329
What? What?

14:24.331 --> 14:25.563
If you have something to say
to me, just say it. What is it?

14:25.565 --> 14:26.798
I'm not an idiot.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.566
I know why you suddenly
want to hang out.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.001
The two daughters
you actually like

14:30.003 --> 14:31.569
Are all busy,
so you're thinking, "hmm.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.605
Don't I have another one of
these laying around somewhere?"

14:34.840 --> 14:36.207
E-Eve, Eve, Eve!

14:36.209 --> 14:38.977
Don't talk to your mom
like that!

14:38.979 --> 14:40.478
Listen, don't listen --
don't listen to her.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.913
She got hit in the head
with a soccer ball

14:41.915 --> 14:44.549
Way too many times.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.550
I do tons of stuff with Eve.
I know you do.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.985
Honey,
you don't need to tell me.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.720
I-I take her for milkshakes
at stony's.
I know.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.322
Stony's closed years ago,
honey.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.560
It turned into a blockbuster,
which is out of business now.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.995
It's a --
it's a vacant lot.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.329
But you know,
o-oddly enough,

14:58.331 --> 14:59.731
Th-they're thinking of putting
a milkshake place back there.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.499
Oh, stop.
Yeah.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.101
You know,
maybe she's right.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.068
She's not right.
Honey, please.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.370
No, she is.
Vanessa, Vanessa.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.005
I-I have spent a lot more time
with her sisters and --

15:07.007 --> 15:09.574
And I really
let things slide with Eve.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.010
I'm such a bad,
bad mom.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.010
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.280
You're close to different kids
at different times in your life.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.115
Mm, do you think Kristin
and Mandy resent you

15:17.117 --> 15:18.716
For not spending more time
with them?

15:18.718 --> 15:20.351
Don't know,
don't care.

15:22.454 --> 15:25.523
I'm gonna go talk
to Eve.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.859
Well,
you could do that.

15:27.861 --> 15:28.860
Or?

15:28.862 --> 15:30.628
Or you could give it
some time,

15:30.630 --> 15:31.863
Let her think about it.

15:31.865 --> 15:35.099
This is coming from me,
the Eve expert.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.071
[ groans ]

15:52.217 --> 15:53.952
[ guitar playing ]

15:53.954 --> 15:55.386
[ knock on door ]
hey.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.089
Mothers and daughters,
huh?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.590
What are you doing?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.125
Having a little heart-to-heart
with you.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.494
Hmm. Pass.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.930
We could have a foot-to-butt
'cause I don't like

16:05.932 --> 16:07.665
How you talked
to your mom.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.101
Dad, you know everything I said
was true.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.104
She'd much rather be hanging out
with Mandy or Kristin,

16:13.106 --> 16:14.939
Taking them to brunch
or to the spa.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.076
Do you have any interest
in any of those things?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.177
Hell no.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.346
But I'd like to be asked
so I can roll my eyes.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.114
After seven years
of rolling your eyes,

16:23.116 --> 16:24.649
Maybe your mom
stopped trying.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.484
See?
She bailed on me.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.652
You bailed on her.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.654
Because everything
she likes to do is lame.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.023
"the brake is your buddy.
The brake is your buddy."

16:32.025 --> 16:33.491
The brake may be
her only buddy.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.927
[ sighs ]
your mom does that
because she loves you

16:35.929 --> 16:37.862
And wants you safe.
You only think she's lame

16:37.864 --> 16:40.031
Because you're comparing her
to stuff I do.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.500
I killed a mountain lion
with my bare hands.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.002
Mm.
I'm not sure that counts

16:44.004 --> 16:46.104
If your bare hands
are holding a rifle.

16:46.106 --> 16:51.709
Some guys wear gloves.
That's all I'm saying.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.312
You know, I think
sometimes this is my fault

16:54.314 --> 16:56.514
Because I hogged you
all your life.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.316
I had two daughters,
and I really wanted a son.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.519
You can only imagine how excited
I was when you came along.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.389
I'm a daughter,
too, dad.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.457
Don't
sell yourself short.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.527
You're much more than that
to me, all right?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.396
Listen, your mom reached out
to you, and you shut her down.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.864
I think it's time
you reach out to her.

17:12.866 --> 17:13.998
That's what
I'm trying to say.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
But she's the mom.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.502
And you're the kid,
but not forever.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.569
Time goes on.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.038
This isn't gonna last forever,
you know?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.906
You want a connection
with your mom?

17:21.908 --> 17:22.974
It's a great thing.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.043
I think it's time
you thought of stuff

17:25.045 --> 17:27.678
That you guys can do together,
stuff that she likes.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.880
Like what?

17:28.882 --> 17:31.716
Uh, mani-pedis, pedi-manis,
that stuff, and you --

17:31.718 --> 17:34.352
You pluck and you prod
and you pull and you oil

17:34.354 --> 17:36.988
And a lot of emollients --
that stuff.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.824
How -- how about
french movies?

17:47.933 --> 17:49.567
Hey, mom.
Hmm?

17:49.569 --> 17:50.768
Are you busy?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.537
Hey, honey.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.839
Uh, yeah,
I-I just got a call from work.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.607
I got to drive out
to somerset.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.109
Um...

17:58.111 --> 18:00.845
I just wanted to tell you
I thought I was kind of a jerk

18:00.847 --> 18:02.713
Today in the car.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.183
Yeah, you --
you kind of were.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.120
And you might want to send
a note to mrs. Gaffney,

18:09.122 --> 18:13.124
Or at least pay
to get her wig dry-cleaned.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.427
Honey, come here,
come here, come on.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.696
Come sit down.
Come on.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.866
I always have time
for my third-favorite daughter.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.903
I-I just wanted to say

18:25.905 --> 18:27.905
That I-I miss us hanging out,
you know?

18:27.907 --> 18:32.043
I think we should
do more things together.

18:32.045 --> 18:36.447
Me, too. Me, too.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.049
Like what?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.152
[ sighs ]

18:41.154 --> 18:43.721
Uh...You like wine,
right?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.923
Oh.
[ laughs ]

18:45.925 --> 18:48.126
Nice try. Nice try.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.093
Now, come on. Come on.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.261
Let's think
of something else.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.729
What -- what --
what did we used to do?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.499
Gosh. I don't know.
Just...

18:54.501 --> 18:57.935
Um...

18:57.937 --> 19:00.805
You used to
give me baths.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.141
Well, that might be
kind of weird now.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.009
[ groans ] yeah.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.344
Well, hey, um,
what's going on in somerset?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.812
Is that something?

19:07.814 --> 19:11.616
Uh, well, I'm decommissioning
the entry point to a coal seam.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.185
But y-you don't
want to hear about this.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.620
No, it --
I'm interested.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.923
Uh, well, first,
we have to ventilate the mine

19:18.925 --> 19:20.158
For residual v.A.M.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.593
Yeah, v.A.M. Yeah.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.128
You don't want any of that
hanging around.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.296
No, you don't.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.132
And after that, we initiate
a controlled implosion

19:28.134 --> 19:30.034
To seal
the main shaft.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.837
W-wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.438
Implosion?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.708
That, like, kind of sounds like
you're blowing something up.

19:37.710 --> 19:41.546
I am.
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.949
Okay, I'm -- I'm --
I'm blowing up a coal mine.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.350
[ chuckles ]

19:46.352 --> 19:49.287
Yeah, maybe I should have
led with that.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.721
Oh, my --
oh, my god.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.057
W-w-what are you working with,
nitro, r.D.X., dynamite?

19:53.059 --> 19:54.892
What's your ordnance?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.494
Dynamite,
about half a ton.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.196
Sweet! I'm so in!

19:58.198 --> 19:59.797
No, honey. No, no.
It's kind of dangerous.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.099
You don't have to
sweeten the pot, mom.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.871
Please.
Okay, okay, okay.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.140
Oh, what the hell?
But listen.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.976
You got to go by my rules
and no complaining.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.245
I will put my hands at 10:00
and 2:00 on the detonator.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.681
But seriously, I-I can't wait
to tell all my friends

20:16.683 --> 20:18.015
That you,
like, blow stuff up.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.984
Not only that,
but after the implosion,

20:19.986 --> 20:22.053
I examine the sedimentary debris
for bituminous rock.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.021
Don't dork out on me,
mom.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.356
Okay. No, no.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.390
[ laughs ]

20:26.392 --> 20:29.193
Yeah,
I-I blow stuff up.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.195
Great. Let's hit it.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.597
Um, wait.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.165
Uh, somerset's like
three hours away.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.700
You don't need
your helmet yet.

20:35.702 --> 20:39.003
Yes, I do
'cause you are driving.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.072
Yes!

20:51.717 --> 20:53.117
Eve: Yes! Touchdown!
Mike: Touchdown!

20:53.119 --> 20:54.085
Whoo!
I'm gonna celebrate
with a cold beer.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.086
You've earned it.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.521
You carried that team
on your back.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.724
Oh, honey, is that the player
you were telling me about

20:59.726 --> 21:01.225
On the drive back
from somerset?

21:01.227 --> 21:02.627
The one
who got suspended?

21:02.629 --> 21:03.594
Yes.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.695
Luckily for us,

21:04.697 --> 21:05.930
The suspension cost him
like 800 grand,

21:05.932 --> 21:07.031
So now he's pissed

21:07.033 --> 21:08.899
And knocking the snot
out of the other team.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.801
Oh.
Who are we playing?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.203
The raiders.
Hmm.

21:12.205 --> 21:14.205
How's
their season going?

21:14.207 --> 21:16.807
Well, you know the mine shaft
we blew up?

21:16.809 --> 21:18.409
Yeah.
A little worse than that.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.710
[ imitates explosion ]

21:19.712 --> 21:21.479
Hey, dad.
Hi.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.114
What you looking at?

21:23.116 --> 21:28.219
Ah, sometimes when god closes
a coal mine, he opens a window.
