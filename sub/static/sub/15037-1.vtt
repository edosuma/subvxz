Bingo.

00:41.278 --> 00:42.540
G-48.

00:42.646 --> 00:44.011
Bingo!

01:10.574 --> 01:11.973
Bingo.

01:36.734 --> 01:40.033
- Man, Bonehead's really swinging!
- I do believe.

01:43.874 --> 01:47.435
Well, if it's all that good,
let's give it a chance.

01:50.047 --> 01:51.947
I don't think that's it.

01:53.751 --> 01:56.948
<i>A shot in the mouth?
That's exactly what Dennis Frank...</i>

02:01.392 --> 02:05.795
<i>Do you have a headache?
The answer is Witch Doctor's Aspirin.</i>

02:08.598 --> 02:11.363
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

02:11.435 --> 02:13.596
<i>Beach blanket bingo.</i>

02:17.207 --> 02:19.539
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

02:20.077 --> 02:22.739
<i>Take a blanket made for two, now</i>

02:22.813 --> 02:24.804
<i>Add a boy and a girl</i>

02:25.783 --> 02:28.445
<i>That's a game for
me and you, now</i>

02:28.652 --> 02:30.984
<i>Yeah, let's give it a whirl</i>

02:31.488 --> 02:33.718
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

02:34.391 --> 02:36.723
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

02:37.294 --> 02:39.421
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

02:40.130 --> 02:42.462
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

02:43.067 --> 02:45.831
<i>- Every lad and...
- Every lassie</i>

02:45.936 --> 02:48.063
<i>Playing down by the shore</i>

02:48.739 --> 02:51.572
<i>- Looking smart
- And looking classy</i>

02:51.642 --> 02:54.236
<i>Yeah, they're learning the score</i>

02:54.511 --> 02:57.275
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

02:57.347 --> 03:00.248
<i>Beach blanket bingo.</i>

03:00.317 --> 03:03.115
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

03:03.187 --> 03:05.417
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

03:14.498 --> 03:16.830
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

03:17.334 --> 03:20.132
<i>When a lad just meets a lassie</i>

03:20.204 --> 03:22.263
<i>And he asks for a kiss</i>

03:23.140 --> 03:25.938
<i>Then he finds the lassie sassy</i>

03:26.009 --> 03:28.273
<i>- Right blanket!
- Wrong miss!</i>

03:28.846 --> 03:31.610
<i>Beach blanket bingo</i>

03:31.682 --> 03:34.378
<i>Beach blanket bingo.</i>

03:34.485 --> 03:37.352

03:37.454 --> 03:39.285
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

03:40.290 --> 03:42.724
<i>Play the game like
you should do, now</i>

03:42.826 --> 03:45.056
<i>That's the start of the fun</i>

03:45.963 --> 03:48.693
<i>When you find the
girl for you, now</i>

03:48.799 --> 03:50.630
<i>Bingo! You've won!</i>

03:51.502 --> 03:54.300

04:03.013 --> 04:05.345
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

04:05.849 --> 04:07.578
<i>Bingo!</i>

04:44.288 --> 04:45.619
Hey, look!

04:48.559 --> 04:51.392
"Hear Sugar Kane's... "

04:51.461 --> 04:53.520
We can read, Goo Goo.

05:02.906 --> 05:04.806
Hey, look at that!

05:06.076 --> 05:08.237
Remember, as close
to the boat as you can.

05:08.312 --> 05:10.371
I'll land in the captain's lap.

05:10.447 --> 05:12.915
- You do, and I'll...
- Bye-bye!

05:15.552 --> 05:17.543
- It's a girl.
- It figures.

05:17.621 --> 05:20.317
Somebody must have
left the door open.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.263
That's what I call a high dive.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.299
Hey, it's a free fall!

05:39.843 --> 05:42.937
- Hey, look at that! That's great, huh?
- That's wild.

05:46.450 --> 05:49.578
Boy, that's out of sight!
It's too much. Wow!

06:03.000 --> 06:05.867
- Do you think that's a publicity stunt?
- Well, sure it is.

06:05.969 --> 06:07.698
Man, that's sure some stunt.

06:07.804 --> 06:10.136
Well, what if she's in trouble?
We should help her.

06:10.207 --> 06:13.267
Oh, look, don't panic.
You see that rich boy's canoe out there?

06:13.343 --> 06:16.369
He'll pick her up. Boy, are you gullible!

06:20.450 --> 06:22.611
See, what'd I tell you?

06:23.954 --> 06:26.582
Dee Dee, a smart promoter
could sell you Grant's tomb.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.989
Oh, no. I've got sense enough
not to buy that again.

06:41.271 --> 06:42.863
Gosh, I wish I could do that.

06:42.940 --> 06:46.876
You just did, kiddo.
Now get out there and take the bows.

06:47.511 --> 06:49.172
Gee, I'm a little scared.

06:49.246 --> 06:51.441
Look, somebody paid a lot
of money for this stunt.

06:51.548 --> 06:53.277
Don't louse it up now.

06:53.383 --> 06:56.750
- Well, isn't it kind of cold?
- Only on the top.

07:01.224 --> 07:04.216
They didn't pick her up.
What's the matter with those guys?

07:04.294 --> 07:05.693
I don't know. Let's go find out.

07:05.762 --> 07:09.858
Hold it. If they passed her up,
I have a feeling we should, too.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.423
Come on, Bonehead.

07:11.535 --> 07:13.935
Come on, you guys, let's go!

07:16.373 --> 07:19.399
- Come on, you guys!
- Let's get her!

07:46.436 --> 07:49.337
Perfect.
Earl, take a look at this.

07:54.845 --> 07:56.779
And now it's our move.

07:58.815 --> 08:02.012
All right, men. This is one of my big ones.
Oh, hi, girls.

08:02.119 --> 08:05.145
I can see the headlines now.
"Singer saved by surfer. "

08:05.255 --> 08:07.849
Perfect.
There's a pearl for you, Earl.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.186
Yeah, I wish I'd said that.

08:09.292 --> 08:12.955
Oh, you will. It's all yours.
Anything for the column.

08:15.632 --> 08:17.031
Sugar's out there.

08:17.134 --> 08:20.001
- Hey, what's going on?
- You'll see.

08:23.006 --> 08:24.803
Put your arm around her, boy.

08:24.875 --> 08:28.436
- Hey, what is this?
- Don't be a problem. Perfect.

08:28.512 --> 08:31.606
Hey, look, if I put my arm
around someone, I like it to be my idea.

08:31.681 --> 08:32.773
You're a hero, boy.

08:32.849 --> 08:35.443
You just saved a beautiful young girl
from the jaws of the deep.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.111
Got that, Earl? "Jaws of the deep. "

08:37.187 --> 08:40.350
Yeah, I'm gonna keep
that one for my wallet.

08:41.323 --> 08:45.317
- I have a feeling she didn't need saving.
- Yeah, but Frankie might.

08:46.129 --> 08:50.532
You kids know who this is?
It's Earl Wilson, the famous columnist.

08:50.634 --> 08:53.501
- Who's she? The BW?
- What's a BW?

08:53.570 --> 08:55.902
Well, in Earl's column,
it always means his beautiful wife,

08:56.006 --> 08:57.371
only this one isn't.

08:57.474 --> 09:01.205
- Beautiful, yes, but wife, no.
- Haven't you ever heard of Earl Wilson?

09:01.311 --> 09:05.680
Oh, you'll have to excuse Bonehead.
He hasn't even heard of President Wilson.

09:05.749 --> 09:09.480
Well, Mr. Wilson has come all the
way out from New York

09:09.553 --> 09:11.885
just for this one interview, right, Earl?

09:11.988 --> 09:14.684
- You might say that.
- I just did.

09:14.758 --> 09:16.385
Is she somebody or something?

09:16.493 --> 09:19.860
"Is she somebody?"
Where you been living, in a cave?

09:19.930 --> 09:21.022
You're close.

09:21.098 --> 09:24.329
Come along, now,
and let's get out of these loose clothes

09:24.401 --> 09:26.926
and slip into something tight.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.733
I'd like to see her slip
out of something tight

09:29.840 --> 09:33.367
and into something more comfortable,
like my arms.

09:33.610 --> 09:36.204
Just think of me as your father.

09:41.618 --> 09:43.848
Now I think we're ready.

09:45.522 --> 09:47.752
Now, that's what I call a healthy girl.

09:47.858 --> 09:50.383
Sugar Kane doing
her first free fall...

09:50.460 --> 09:54.760
in honor of her album of sky songs,
Come Fall With Me.

10:03.206 --> 10:04.730
What's up, boss?

10:04.808 --> 10:07.368
Shut up. I'm thinking.

10:07.444 --> 10:09.207
How long will that take?

10:09.279 --> 10:11.304
Until I get it thunk.

10:18.788 --> 10:22.952
Perfect. Oh, we need our
little hero in a picture.

10:25.162 --> 10:26.891
I can make it on my own.

10:32.502 --> 10:36.268
- I didn't catch your name, boy.
- I didn't throw it.

10:36.339 --> 10:38.500
That's pretty tacky, boy.

10:38.608 --> 10:41.338
I didn't want us to have
a language barrier.

10:41.444 --> 10:44.777
That's enough pictures.
Don't want to tire her.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.815
Let's dig this groovy chick.
Come on.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.851
How far did you fall
before your chute opened?

10:51.955 --> 10:54.515
- How does it feel, falling?
- Hey, where'd you learn the free-fall bit?

10:54.624 --> 10:57.354
At Big Drop's Skydiving Club.
It's just over the hill.

10:57.460 --> 11:01.362
- How do you know when to pull the cord?
- Before you hit the ground, Goo Goo.

11:01.464 --> 11:03.955
Yes. Well, it's sort of hard to explain.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.834
You see, when you're
falling, it's like...

11:06.937 --> 11:09.997
Well, I get the feeling
I'm somebody else all the time.

11:10.106 --> 11:12.040
I think we'll be more comfortable
up at the beach house.

11:12.142 --> 11:15.202
And I'll get Sugar to sing for you.
Excuse me.

11:15.645 --> 11:18.614
Little Sugar's too excited
to talk right now, fellas,

11:18.682 --> 11:20.115
and Earl's waiting to interview her.

11:20.183 --> 11:22.117
But I'll tell you what.
Keep in touch.

11:22.185 --> 11:25.621
Here, have my card.
Take one. They're free.

11:27.190 --> 11:29.385
Now, that's pretty tacky.

11:30.527 --> 11:31.960
Oh, a smartnik.

11:32.028 --> 11:34.189
But tomorrow, boy,
look for your picture in the paper.

11:34.297 --> 11:35.321
Come along, sweet.

11:35.398 --> 11:38.128
Sugar lives right up the beach.
You're all invited anytime.

11:38.201 --> 11:40.999
Come on up and hear
her latest album.

11:41.304 --> 11:43.704
- Bye.
- Frankie.

11:43.807 --> 11:46.537
- Bye, Frankie.
- All right. Come on, dear.

11:46.643 --> 11:48.304
"Bye, Frankie. "

11:48.378 --> 11:50.005
Looks like Frankie's done it again.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.310
Yeah, and he struck
a real gusher this time.

11:57.721 --> 11:59.348
You stupids!

11:59.723 --> 12:01.315
I'm through thinking.

12:01.391 --> 12:02.858
Now, what I'm thinking is,

12:02.926 --> 12:06.259
that poor little Sugar Kane
is mixed up with undesirables.

12:06.429 --> 12:08.863
Well, Eric Von Zipper's gonna protect her.

12:08.932 --> 12:11.765
I think I adore her. She's nifty.

12:11.868 --> 12:15.827
- That skydiving looks like fun.
- Like to try it, boss?

12:19.209 --> 12:20.540
Eric Von...

12:20.610 --> 12:23.101
Eric Von Zipper thinks
cycles is better.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.010
- Right?
- Right.

12:25.081 --> 12:26.605
We go!

12:35.091 --> 12:37.855
Eric Von Zipper ain't gonna
get left behind this time.

12:37.927 --> 12:40.555
Jerome, you... Me...

13:48.531 --> 13:50.123
It's a wiggy beach.

13:55.472 --> 13:57.099
Okay, ready?

13:57.674 --> 14:00.871
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

14:01.678 --> 14:04.112
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

14:04.180 --> 14:05.511
<i>Go, Donna!</i>

14:05.715 --> 14:09.776
<i>You ask me if
I ever long for him</i>

14:09.853 --> 14:13.721
<i>Since we said goodbye</i>

14:13.823 --> 14:17.782
<i>Sure, I get sad
But it's not too bad</i>

14:17.861 --> 14:21.854
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

14:21.965 --> 14:25.799
<i>You see,
I hardly even think of him</i>

14:25.869 --> 14:29.896
<i>As time goes slowly by</i>

14:30.006 --> 14:33.840
<i>I just go on like
there's nothing wrong</i>

14:33.910 --> 14:38.006
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

14:38.081 --> 14:41.915
<i>Sure, I remember our first kiss</i>

14:42.018 --> 14:45.886
<i>The way I loved him then</i>

14:45.989 --> 14:49.891
<i>Sometimes I think a love like this</i>

14:49.993 --> 14:53.929
<i>Could never happen again</i>

14:54.030 --> 14:58.160
<i>So please don't worry
if I sigh for him</i>

14:58.234 --> 15:01.897
<i>You know that I'll get by</i>

15:02.005 --> 15:05.873
<i>I'll just pretend that
it's not the end</i>

15:05.942 --> 15:10.106
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

15:10.213 --> 15:13.876
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

15:13.950 --> 15:18.216
<i>It only hurts when I cry.</i>

15:18.288 --> 15:22.247
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

15:22.358 --> 15:26.260
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

15:26.362 --> 15:30.264
<i>Sure, I remember our first kiss</i>

15:30.366 --> 15:33.961
<i>The way I loved him then</i>

15:34.070 --> 15:38.268
<i>Sometimes I think a love like this</i>

15:38.374 --> 15:42.367
<i>Could never happen again</i>

15:42.445 --> 15:46.541
<i>So please don't worry
if I sigh for him</i>

15:46.616 --> 15:50.609
<i>You know that I'll get by</i>

15:50.720 --> 15:54.588
<i>I'll just pretend that
it's not the end</i>

15:54.657 --> 15:58.650
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

15:58.761 --> 16:02.663
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

16:02.765 --> 16:06.826
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

16:06.936 --> 16:12.897
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

16:23.686 --> 16:25.779
- Dee Dee, I've been thinking.
- About what?

16:25.855 --> 16:28.881
- About Sugar.
- Oh, really?

16:28.992 --> 16:30.619
No, I mean about skydiving.

16:30.693 --> 16:33.457
Boy, it'd be a new thrill up there.
Just imagine that feeling.

16:33.530 --> 16:36.556
Yeah, like a bird.
When do we start?

16:37.233 --> 16:38.325
We?

16:38.401 --> 16:40.905
Well, sure. It'll be
a new thrill up there.

16:40.906 --> 16:42.701
Yeah, for me,
but not for you.

16:42.805 --> 16:45.000
A girl's job is in the kitchen,

16:45.074 --> 16:47.406
at least until she learns
how to cook a hot dog.

16:47.510 --> 16:48.738
Dinner was burnt.

16:48.845 --> 16:51.211
Women have a few rights,
in case you haven't heard.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.406
We can even vote.

16:52.515 --> 16:55.643
- Yeah, that's the real American tragedy.
- Very funny.

16:55.718 --> 16:57.379
Okay, play your little game.

16:57.487 --> 17:01.480
But when the time comes,
I do the jumping and you do the watching.

17:03.359 --> 17:06.589
Come on, let's turn in.
We'll want to get an early start.

17:15.771 --> 17:17.535
- Hi, Butch.
- Hi.

17:22.011 --> 17:23.376
Bingo!

17:42.432 --> 17:43.763
Well!

17:45.702 --> 17:48.796
Mark Anthony and Cleopatra
have returned.

17:48.905 --> 17:51.897
You know something, Bonehead?
You remind me of the ocean.

17:51.975 --> 17:55.570
- You mean I'm so deep?
- No. You make me sick.

17:57.780 --> 17:59.577
I think I'm sorry I asked.

17:59.649 --> 18:01.048
Hey, fellas, what do you say...

18:01.117 --> 18:03.415
we hit Big Drop's tomorrow
and make the skydiving scene, huh?

18:03.486 --> 18:05.215
Yeah, that's a good scene.

18:05.288 --> 18:08.587
- How about you, Bonehead?
- I ain't gonna jump out of no airplane.

18:08.658 --> 18:13.061
- I may be dumb, but I'm not...
- Bonehead, don't put it to a vote.

18:14.097 --> 18:16.395
I'm going with Frankie tomorrow
to try the skydiving bit.

18:16.466 --> 18:18.957
- Any of you girls with me?
- Sure!

18:19.068 --> 18:20.763
Hey, you girls are crazy.

18:20.837 --> 18:24.295
- Why? You fellas are gonna do it.
- Yeah, but boys are different.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.898
I've noticed, and I'm glad.

18:26.976 --> 18:28.443
Now, that's my kind of people.

18:28.511 --> 18:32.174
You girls are so anxious to jump,
why don't you jump down here?

18:32.281 --> 18:34.647
I'll guarantee you a happy landing.

18:34.751 --> 18:38.152
I'd rather jump out of an airplane
without a parachute.

18:38.254 --> 18:40.688
Either way you get to heaven.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.191
Hey, that's a good-looking kid.

18:48.831 --> 18:52.028
- Yeah, she's not bad.
- I wasn't talking about her.

18:52.135 --> 18:54.501
See? You're crazy about him.

18:54.604 --> 18:57.129
One look at a picture in the paper
and you're nuts about the guy.

18:57.206 --> 18:58.935
Oh, come off it, will you?

18:59.275 --> 19:01.675
Hi, kids. Welcome to Big Drop's,

19:01.778 --> 19:03.803
where everything is sky-high
but the prices.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.677
- Hi. What's up?
- Hi.

19:05.782 --> 19:07.943
- I'm Big Drop.
- Big Drop?

19:08.017 --> 19:09.143
It's just a nickname.

19:09.218 --> 19:12.381
They used to call me Big Droop,
but I had it shortened.

19:18.695 --> 19:21.027
Seems to me
I've seen him somewhere before.

19:21.130 --> 19:23.530
That's Buster, my helper,
and Bobbi, his helper.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.498
Looks like she could use a helper, too.

19:25.568 --> 19:28.401
It's just good, clean fun.
Keeps him out of pool halls.

19:28.504 --> 19:30.870
Come on in and look around.

19:36.345 --> 19:37.676
Look around you, gang.

19:37.747 --> 19:41.012
It isn't much,
but we like to think of it as our home.

19:41.084 --> 19:44.076
This is Bonnie and Steve.
They help me run the place.

19:44.187 --> 19:45.347
- Hi.
- Hi, gang.

19:45.421 --> 19:46.513
Hello, there.

19:46.589 --> 19:49.353
These kids want to learn
all about skydiving.

19:49.425 --> 19:50.824
Free fall and everything.

19:50.893 --> 19:55.262
Of course, free fall isn't really free,
but it's cheaper than expensive.

19:55.364 --> 19:58.527
I assume you children
want to learn all about skydiving?

19:58.601 --> 20:01.570
- This child does.
- This child's from Wig City.

20:01.671 --> 20:03.002
I buy that.

20:03.072 --> 20:06.200
All right, I'll leave you kids
with Bonnie and Steve.

20:06.275 --> 20:09.176
If you brought money,
I'll see you in the office.

20:12.448 --> 20:15.781
I saw your picture in the paper
this morning.

20:15.885 --> 20:17.546
It didn't really flatter you.

20:17.620 --> 20:21.613
- It was my bad side. I was facing front.
- That's cute.

20:22.759 --> 20:24.556
We really do want
to learn skydiving.

20:24.627 --> 20:27.357
She has some crazy idea
she wants to try it.

20:27.430 --> 20:30.422
Why not? Bonnie's made over 100 dives,
and she's still in one piece.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.761
You can say that again.

20:31.868 --> 20:36.362
Why not? Bonnie's made over 100 dives,
and she's still in one piece.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.406
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

20:39.475 --> 20:40.874
He does to me.

20:40.943 --> 20:44.743
Best way to learn is to watch.
Bonnie and I'll show you a double free fall.

20:44.814 --> 20:48.147
Well, maybe first you ought to explain
some of the dangers involved.

20:48.251 --> 20:51.243
The only dangerous part
is driving to the airport.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.778
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Let's go, guys.

20:56.058 --> 20:59.789
- And you can show me.
- My pleasure.

21:06.102 --> 21:09.663
- Hey, ladies first.
- Go.

21:16.345 --> 21:18.006
There she goes!

21:50.046 --> 21:51.980
Oh, look at that!

21:52.048 --> 21:53.845
It's beautiful! I can't wait.

21:53.950 --> 21:56.214
Look, Dee Dee, Bonnie is an expert.

21:56.319 --> 21:57.980
I learn fast.

22:00.823 --> 22:02.484
Look at that!

23:44.226 --> 23:46.285
Hey, there's Bonehead.

23:52.234 --> 23:53.667
Perfect.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.236
- What happened?
- Well, he was surfing, and...

24:05.314 --> 24:06.804
She saved him, that's what happened.

24:06.916 --> 24:09.111
This poor boy was out there
floundering helpless,

24:09.185 --> 24:10.812
and Sugar swam out
and pulled him in.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.820
- She's a heroine.
- Bullets, I...

24:12.922 --> 24:15.117
Sugar, don't be modest.
We all know what you've done.

24:15.191 --> 24:17.489
Just rest your head
back on Sugar's lap, boy.

24:17.593 --> 24:18.753
Sure.

24:18.828 --> 24:22.286
All right, everybody watching?
Sugar, cry a little.

24:31.173 --> 24:35.269
Perfect. I've done it again.
Tell me your name, boy.

24:35.344 --> 24:37.710
Well, everybody calls me Bonehead.

24:37.813 --> 24:41.146
- Oh. Well, what do your friends call you?
- Stupid.

24:41.217 --> 24:42.650
This calls for a celebration.

24:42.718 --> 24:45.312
Tomorrow night, supper at Sugar's.
How about it, kids?

24:45.388 --> 24:49.188
- Separate checks?
- Aren't you getting shorter?

24:49.358 --> 24:52.350
Don't be late, kids.
Come along, Sugar.

24:53.729 --> 24:55.890
Up, boy. We got the picture.

24:59.201 --> 25:02.364
You know something?
I just don't know.

25:02.471 --> 25:04.905
You know something?
With your luck, you don't have to.

25:05.007 --> 25:06.338
Well said.

25:13.716 --> 25:16.241
You tired? Chalk.

25:21.390 --> 25:23.324
Whoa! Got an itch?

25:24.727 --> 25:27.696
You know, the name of
the game is pool, bubby.

25:27.763 --> 25:29.924
Now, you gonna play it or not?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.231
You know, I shaved twice
since you last shot.

25:35.438 --> 25:37.929
Von Zipper plays
when Von Zipper is ready.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.667
Cue. Powder.

25:41.177 --> 25:44.112
Will you... Will you...
Not here, here.

26:02.598 --> 26:06.227
Let me know when you're
going to play, bubby.

26:07.369 --> 26:09.394
Hey, boss. Come here.

26:10.639 --> 26:13.039
Out! I'll murder you
at the zoo tomorrow. Go.

26:13.109 --> 26:14.974
All right. Later, daddy.

26:15.744 --> 26:18.406
- Did you lose this, boss?
- Oh, stupid.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.146
- What? What is it? What?
- Read this.

26:23.385 --> 26:26.149
- Look at the picture.
- What does that say?

26:26.622 --> 26:29.250
"Skydiving singer saves surfer. "

26:29.525 --> 26:30.992
Read me more.

26:37.299 --> 26:39.290
Slow. Read slow.

26:39.368 --> 26:42.303
"Di-min-u-tive

26:42.371 --> 26:45.465

"Also, plans will be disgusted

26:52.348 --> 26:55.875
"for Sugar's new album
and concerning the surfters. "

26:55.985 --> 26:57.111
That does it.

26:57.186 --> 26:59.677
Them rotten surfers
ain't gonna get away with it this time.

26:59.788 --> 27:03.053
Us good guys are gonna save Sugar

27:03.159 --> 27:05.354

- Our work is never done.

Our work is to protect
the weak and the innocent.

All right, kids,

28:52.801 --> 28:56.134
and I guess you always will be
for the rest of your lives.

29:00.609 --> 29:02.736
Old Bullets has a real
treat for you.

29:02.811 --> 29:07.805
Miss Sugar Kane doing a number
from her new album, Come Fall With Me.

29:19.628 --> 29:22.756
<i>New love</i>

29:22.831 --> 29:27.530
<i>He's my new love</i>

29:27.636 --> 29:29.365
<i>He understands</i>

29:29.471 --> 29:30.870

<i>I love you more each day</i>

29:58.167 --> 30:01.193
<i>Not bad.
Not bad at all.</i>

30:01.303 --> 30:03.294
<i>I've noticed you noticing.</i>

30:05.307 --> 30:08.140
<i>Professionally.
Singing, you know.</i>

31:12.875 --> 31:16.606
<i>My love</i>

31:23.118 --> 31:24.380
That's it, fellas.

31:24.453 --> 31:26.216
Crowd around, crowd around.
Smile, Sugar.

31:26.288 --> 31:28.279
This could be the cover
for your next album.

31:37.733 --> 31:41.464
Stop the music!
Stop the music! Stop the music!

31:42.438 --> 31:45.737
Stand aside, everyone.
I take large steps.

31:47.009 --> 31:50.604
Well, looks like the carbon monoxide
commandos are back.

31:51.180 --> 31:54.115
Look, fellas, don't make me
call the pest control.

31:54.183 --> 31:56.344
I am Eric Von Zipper,

31:56.452 --> 31:59.979
and I come here to tell you
that these beach bums is bums,

32:00.088 --> 32:03.455
and ain't nobody
making no album with them.

32:03.525 --> 32:08.827
They can make it with me and my cycles.
You could call it Come Cycle With Me.

32:08.931 --> 32:11.627
Oh, perfect.
You'll hear from us. Next.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.531
I got one more thing.

32:16.371 --> 32:18.669
Eric Von Zipper adores you.

32:18.774 --> 32:22.676
And when Eric Von Zipper adores
somebody, they stay adored.

32:23.479 --> 32:25.470
- That's stupid.
- That's stupid.

32:26.114 --> 32:29.174
I am my ideal,
but you are my idol.

32:29.284 --> 32:30.478
Hey, Von Zipper.

32:30.552 --> 32:32.383
Why don't you crawl
back under your rock?

32:32.488 --> 32:34.353
Leave him talk.
He ain't through.

32:34.456 --> 32:37.687
Thanks, J.D.
That's short for Juvenile Delinquent.

32:37.793 --> 32:40.523
From the looks of him,
you wouldn't think he'd ever make it.

32:40.629 --> 32:42.961
Oh, it wasn't easy,
but I helped him.

32:44.132 --> 32:46.862
And these is my two mice,
Puss 'n' Boots.

32:46.969 --> 32:49.199
- I am pleased...
- I am sure.

32:51.139 --> 32:53.039
I thought up them names myself.

32:53.141 --> 32:55.405
You know something?
I believe you.

32:56.578 --> 33:03.006
My idol used to be Marlo Brandon,
but he did a moving picture about cycles.

33:03.085 --> 33:07.886
He made them cycle guys to be bad guys,
so he ain't my idol no more.

33:08.257 --> 33:11.158
You are. I could teach
you how to cycle.

33:11.527 --> 33:15.224
- Well, thanks, but...
- Not too close, Sugar. He's a carrier.

33:16.431 --> 33:20.060
Oh, yeah. I could carry her on my cycle.
It's a nice, healthy sport,

33:20.168 --> 33:24.002
out in the wide open spaces,
just like us. It's nifty!

33:24.907 --> 33:27.535
Now, if you hurry,
you can find lots of wide open spaces

33:27.609 --> 33:29.270
just off the premises.

33:29.378 --> 33:31.005
Him, I don't like.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.348
You, he don't like.

33:33.715 --> 33:35.273
Can I depend on that?

33:35.384 --> 33:37.614
I am even thinking
of giving you the Hima...

33:37.719 --> 33:40.017
- The Hima...
- ... layan.

33:40.088 --> 33:42.283
The Himalayan suspenders treatment.

33:42.424 --> 33:44.187
The Himalayan suspenders?

33:44.927 --> 33:47.418
There's definitely a language barrier here.

33:47.529 --> 33:51.295
It's sort of a judo thing.
Professor-type fella taught it to him.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.095
Oh, yeah, there's really
nothing to it, see.

33:53.201 --> 33:55.396
- All you do is you take your finger...
- Watch it, boss.

33:55.470 --> 33:57.131
Oh, I ain't gonna do it,
not to me, I ain't.

33:57.239 --> 34:00.538
- Is this right?
- That's...

34:00.609 --> 34:02.270
- He done it again.
- Only different.

34:02.377 --> 34:05.403
- Yeah, she gave him the finger.
- By remote control.

34:07.549 --> 34:10.245
Oh, I love this game.
Can you move it out of here?

34:10.319 --> 34:11.717
Come on, let's get him out.

34:11.786 --> 34:13.982
Careful, careful.
Don't break him.

34:14.089 --> 34:16.420
He's fragile. Careful.

34:16.992 --> 34:18.891
Eric Von Zipper will return.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.418
Oh, we can't wait.
Crawl in anytime.

34:22.496 --> 34:24.761
Tooty-toot, Mouseketeers.

34:27.636 --> 34:31.003
- Have you seen Bonehead?
- No. Who looks for Bonehead?

34:31.106 --> 34:33.165
Well, I'm worried.
He hasn't been himself lately.

34:33.275 --> 34:35.469
On him, that should be
considered a piece of luck.

34:35.577 --> 34:38.512
Come on, let's sneak away
and talk about us.

34:44.286 --> 34:48.245
- You came out to look for me. I'm glad.
- Hey, you're the one.

34:49.024 --> 34:51.185
But when I came to,
Sugar was there.

34:51.293 --> 34:53.318
I knew something was fishy.

34:53.428 --> 34:55.293
That's very funny, what you said.

34:55.364 --> 34:58.959
Well, what I mean to say
is thank you for saving my life.

34:59.034 --> 35:00.467
You don't have to thank me.

35:00.535 --> 35:03.629
- Do you live around here?
- Yes, I live around here.

35:03.705 --> 35:07.766
- Well, can I come and see you sometime?
- You're seeing me now.

35:07.843 --> 35:11.802
Well, I mean...
Hey, swim in with me and meet the gang.

35:11.980 --> 35:15.848
- No, I'm sorry.
- Well, can I see you again?

35:16.385 --> 35:17.977
Tomorrow at this same time.

35:18.053 --> 35:20.146
There's a cove
about a half a mile down the beach.

35:20.222 --> 35:22.713
I know where it is. I'll be there.

35:23.058 --> 35:25.822
Oh, I don't know your name.

35:25.894 --> 35:29.728
- Lorelei.
- Lorelei. That's pretty.

35:30.532 --> 35:33.831
- Is there a last name?
- Just Lorelei.

35:33.902 --> 35:36.200
There is something else
you should know about me.

35:36.304 --> 35:39.239
- Yes, what?
- I'm a mermaid.

35:39.741 --> 35:42.369
Some of my best friends
are mermaids, Lorelei.

35:42.477 --> 35:44.240
See you tomorrow.

36:03.098 --> 36:06.158
You know something?
You really are one.

36:06.234 --> 36:07.701
I told you I was.

36:07.769 --> 36:10.738
Well, I knew something was different
about you, but not this different.

36:10.839 --> 36:14.172
- Do you still want to meet me tomorrow?
- Gosh, yes. More than ever.

36:14.242 --> 36:16.710
I've never known a girl with a...

36:17.512 --> 36:22.677
I mean, I'll be the only boy in my block
that knows a real, live mermaid.

36:28.256 --> 36:30.747
- You know what I think?
- No, what?

36:30.992 --> 36:32.653
<i>I think</i>

36:32.761 --> 36:34.319

38:19.935 --> 38:21.596
<i>You know</i>

38:21.703 --> 38:26.367
<i>- I love you
- You know I love you</i>

38:32.380 --> 38:34.541
You keep your feet together,
knees slightly bent,

38:34.616 --> 38:36.083
rolling to the right or left,

38:36.184 --> 38:39.381
taking the force of the impact
on your hips and your shoulders.

38:39.454 --> 38:42.116
Do not look down.
Keep your eyes horizon-level at all times.

38:42.224 --> 38:44.852
- Now, you want to try?
- Okay.

38:45.460 --> 38:48.452
Bend those knees.
There you go.

38:50.532 --> 38:52.932
Very good. Not bad.
Did you see the roll?

38:53.034 --> 38:54.262
- Frankie.
- Yeah?

38:54.369 --> 38:57.634
- You want to give me a hand with this?
- Sure, if you'll show me how.

38:57.739 --> 39:00.731
- Oh, it's easy. Just hold onto it.
- All right.

39:00.809 --> 39:04.540
Now give me your hands.
Fasten the chest strap.

39:06.248 --> 39:08.148
- It's right here.
- All right.

39:10.585 --> 39:12.416
- Is this right?
- Yeah, nice.

39:13.388 --> 39:16.448
Looks like your friend and my friend
are getting pretty friendly.

39:16.558 --> 39:18.458
Now hand me the leg straps.

39:24.099 --> 39:25.225
Good.

39:26.434 --> 39:29.301
- Got it?
- Yeah.

39:29.905 --> 39:32.635
Looks like Bonnie's friend
is just a little jealous.

39:32.741 --> 39:34.140
And you're not?

39:34.242 --> 39:37.803
You're darn right I am.
I'm so mad I could jump.

39:37.913 --> 39:39.278
Be my guest.

39:46.588 --> 39:49.785
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, we're not through.

39:49.858 --> 39:51.291
Maybe you're not.

39:54.996 --> 39:57.931
- Hey, you're doing all right.
- Yeah, so are you.

39:57.999 --> 40:02.026
You mean...
Oh, lay off, will you?

40:02.137 --> 40:06.130
- Dee Dee, I love you.
- Don't you "I love you" me.

40:07.976 --> 40:09.136
What?

40:21.723 --> 40:24.283
Hey, Bonehead!
You missed a real kick.

40:25.360 --> 40:28.852
I was right.
Bonehead's really left the scene.

40:29.230 --> 40:30.356
Yeah.

40:31.032 --> 40:33.626
Let's see if we can put
him back in focus.

40:34.202 --> 40:35.464
Bonehead.

40:37.038 --> 40:38.232
Hey, Bonehead.

40:40.709 --> 40:43.837
- Bonehead! Remember me?
- I got something to tell you.

40:43.912 --> 40:47.643
- Tell, Bonehead. We're all ears.
- Her name is Lorelei.

40:47.716 --> 40:51.311
- Whose name is Lorelei?
- This girl, the one who saved me.

40:51.886 --> 40:52.978
Butch.

40:55.023 --> 40:59.687
Bonehead, the girl who saved you,
her name is Sugar. Sugar Kane.

40:59.761 --> 41:02.525
No, that's what everybody thinks,
but it isn't so.

41:02.597 --> 41:05.327
Her name is Lorelei,
and she's a mermaid.

41:07.602 --> 41:10.935
Boney! Boney, are you there?

41:12.540 --> 41:14.440
Hey, I think I've got it.

41:14.542 --> 41:17.375
If anything will pull him
out of a trance, this will.

41:17.445 --> 41:18.844
Be right back.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.841
Bonehead, is there anything you need?
Anything I can get you?

41:23.451 --> 41:24.941
Just Lorelei.

41:25.587 --> 41:26.679
Yeah.

41:33.361 --> 41:35.090
Now, all you have to tell him...

41:35.196 --> 41:37.255
is that he asked you
to the pavilion tonight.

41:37.365 --> 41:38.423
He did?

41:38.533 --> 41:41.024
At the party at your house.
That's what you tell him.

41:41.102 --> 41:42.899
But I remember he didn't.

41:43.371 --> 41:46.465
Well, look, I know he didn't,
but say he did as a favor to me.

41:46.574 --> 41:48.565
I'm trying to pull him out of a trance.

41:48.643 --> 41:51.203
If it's for you, Frankie, I'll do it.

41:51.479 --> 41:54.573
- Thank you.
- Besides, he's kind of cute.

41:58.053 --> 42:01.489
- Bonehead?
- Sugar says it's A-okay for tonight.

42:01.589 --> 42:03.284
- For tonight?
- Yeah, at the pavilion.

42:03.391 --> 42:04.790
You asked me to go.

42:04.893 --> 42:06.656
- I did?
- Well, sure!

42:06.761 --> 42:08.388
And she's all set,
aren't you, Sugar?

42:08.463 --> 42:10.988
I hear you're a real good dancer.
I just can't wait.

42:11.099 --> 42:12.999
Well, swell.

42:14.803 --> 42:18.239
You mind if I talk to Frankie alone
for just a minute?

42:20.175 --> 42:21.665
Go right ahead.

42:22.610 --> 42:24.635
You know this stuff about Lorelei?

42:24.746 --> 42:27.340
It must've been
one of them mirages or something.

42:27.449 --> 42:29.280
Sure. We all get them.

42:29.350 --> 42:33.446
- A mental mind is a terrible thing.
- Man, you know it.

42:33.855 --> 42:38.656
And, Frankie, please, don't say anything
to anybody about the mermaid.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.250
My lips are sealed.

42:58.546 --> 42:59.843
Thanks for coming along, Earl.

42:59.948 --> 43:02.007
I know this isn't
a fancy New York nightclub,

43:02.117 --> 43:04.677
the kind you're used to,
like the 21 Club.

43:08.957 --> 43:12.825
Hi, honey. You look great.
And I'll put you right on.

43:14.395 --> 43:16.329
I've got good news for you, Big Drop.

43:16.397 --> 43:20.026
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
You're leaving?

43:20.135 --> 43:22.160
Now, you gotta stop
making me laugh.

43:22.237 --> 43:25.138
I've got Sugar Kane here with me,
and she'll sing for you.

43:25.206 --> 43:30.567
Who needs girl singers?
Not Big Drop.

43:30.678 --> 43:32.236
I'm in an echo chamber.

43:32.347 --> 43:36.181
For your information,
I've also got Earl Wilson here with me.

43:37.318 --> 43:41.084
Who needs girl singers?
Big Drop.

43:41.189 --> 43:45.355
Tell Miss Kane it'll be our pleasure.

43:45.426 --> 43:48.259
- Perfect. I'll go tell Sugar.
- What is she gonna sing?

43:48.363 --> 43:51.025
Don't worry.
The group's got her music.

43:52.600 --> 43:56.559
Earl? Earl!
There you are. Right over here, Earl.

43:56.671 --> 44:00.664
Sugar, here's Earl again.
And this is... Oh, forget it.

44:01.743 --> 44:04.109
Welcome, kids!
Welcome to the pavilion.

44:04.212 --> 44:07.113
I want you to know
that sitting in our audience right here,

44:07.215 --> 44:08.443
one of the greats.

44:08.550 --> 44:11.451
So great, Earl, I get the chills
every time I mention your name.

44:11.553 --> 44:14.181
One of the greatest writers...
He's cute.

44:14.255 --> 44:18.089
One of the greatest writers of our time,
a sweetheart of a fella, Earl Wilson.

44:18.193 --> 44:19.785
Let's hear it for him.

44:21.596 --> 44:23.689
You're great, Earl.
It's nice to see you.

44:23.765 --> 44:25.756
And I want to tell you
something as a friend.

44:25.867 --> 44:27.095
Somebody tell you you're 11?

44:27.202 --> 44:29.067
Get rid of that hairdo.
You know what I mean?

44:29.137 --> 44:30.695
You don't need the crew-cut haircut.

44:30.772 --> 44:32.706
It's a little embarrassing,
because at your age, Earl...

44:32.774 --> 44:33.866
Please, believe me.

44:33.942 --> 44:35.967
You act as though
you were in the sandbox and you flunked.

44:36.077 --> 44:37.874
You know what I mean, kid?

44:39.380 --> 44:42.577
Frankie and Dee Dee.
Hi, Frankie. Hello, Dee Dee.

44:42.650 --> 44:44.618
Stand up and get sick
for the audience.

44:44.719 --> 44:47.711
You two 43-year-old yo-yos
skipping around the house.

44:47.789 --> 44:49.882
Grow up!
You're a man already, Frank.

44:49.958 --> 44:52.222
How long can you stand
in the bathroom in front of the mirror

44:52.293 --> 44:54.761
going "samba, samba, samba"?

44:55.163 --> 44:57.893
You're 43, Frank.
You're old and wrinkled.

44:57.966 --> 45:01.561
Did you ever hear yourself sing, Frank?
I bet you scare trains.

45:02.570 --> 45:03.798
You sing, Frank, you sound...

45:03.905 --> 45:05.099
I'll be my...

45:05.173 --> 45:07.733
You're old. Let me hear
you say one note. Say...

45:07.809 --> 45:09.834
Wrong! You see what I mean?

45:09.944 --> 45:12.674
That's what I mean! This kid cannot sing.

45:13.748 --> 45:15.613
And I want you to know
one other thing, Dee Dee.

45:15.683 --> 45:17.742
I never liked your personality.

45:18.019 --> 45:21.511
You know what I mean?
You're too short for this type of work.

45:22.323 --> 45:23.915
What are you, a seal?

45:25.627 --> 45:28.824
You're Bonehead, right?
Bonehead, I'm a friend.

45:28.930 --> 45:32.263
I spoke to the Board of Health.
You're gonna be condemned.

45:32.867 --> 45:36.667
Do yourself a favor. Try this.
Spell "pussycat. "

45:37.338 --> 45:38.999
Smart as a whip, huh?

45:39.107 --> 45:42.008
But I want you to know something.
I have nothing against kids.

45:42.110 --> 45:44.670
I don't mind...
I don't mind kids as a whole.

45:44.779 --> 45:47.612
In a group, they annoy me a little bit.

45:47.682 --> 45:50.674
So we're in for a big treat.
Right, Hondells?

45:50.785 --> 45:52.013
Right.

45:54.122 --> 45:57.683
We have a marvelous singer here,
and she's Miss Sugar Kane.

45:57.792 --> 46:00.852
So here she is,
Miss Sugar Kane and the Hondells.

46:12.707 --> 46:15.835
<i>Fly boy</i>

46:15.910 --> 46:18.572
<i>Fly boy.</i>

46:18.680 --> 46:21.706
<i>I want to tell you
about a friend of mine</i>

46:21.816 --> 46:24.876
<i>I love him so he drives
me out of my mind</i>

46:24.986 --> 46:27.819
- She's gonna be a big star, right, Earl?
- Yeah. She's very good.

46:27.889 --> 46:31.586
The biggest. Big with the kids, too.

46:31.693 --> 46:33.854
<i>Flying in his flying machine</i>

46:33.928 --> 46:36.726
<i>High in the sky
now we're making the scene</i>

46:36.798 --> 46:38.732
<i>He's like an angel
well, you know what I mean</i>

46:38.800 --> 46:41.234
They shouldn't be dancing!
Boy. Big Drop!

46:41.302 --> 46:42.929
<i>He's my fly boy</i>

46:43.037 --> 46:46.097
<i>Up in the sky on top of the world</i>

46:46.207 --> 46:49.142
<i>We're in heaven above</i>

46:49.243 --> 46:52.110
<i>He's my guy and I'm his girl</i>

46:52.213 --> 46:53.805
<i>What a way to fall in love</i>

46:53.915 --> 46:56.213
I bet Dee Dee
would rather be dancing with you.

46:56.284 --> 46:58.115
And you'd rather be
dancing with Frankie.

46:58.219 --> 47:00.551
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

47:00.621 --> 47:02.714
- How'd you guess?
- Oh, it was fairly easy.

47:02.790 --> 47:05.554
You're nuts about the guy.
You can't take your eyes off of him.

47:05.626 --> 47:07.924
Well, I was never a subtle type chick.

47:07.995 --> 47:11.158
Okay, you want games?
I'll go along.

47:19.474 --> 47:22.500
<i>We're up in the sky
on top of the world</i>

47:22.610 --> 47:24.601
<i>We're in heaven above</i>

47:25.780 --> 47:28.681
<i>He's my guy and I'm his girl</i>

47:28.783 --> 47:31.752
<i>What a way to fall in love</i>

47:31.819 --> 47:34.913
<i>What a way to fall in love.</i>

47:34.989 --> 47:36.684
<i>Now I know he's got
me under his spell</i>

47:36.791 --> 47:39.954
- Did she maneuver this?
- Sort of.

47:41.763 --> 47:44.425
You're not doing her any favors
by letting her get away with it.

47:44.499 --> 47:47.195
<i>He's my fly boy</i>

47:47.301 --> 47:48.632
<i>Fly boy</i>

47:48.703 --> 47:51.763
<i>My fly boy</i>

47:56.043 --> 47:59.501
<i>He's my fly boy</i>

48:12.527 --> 48:14.688
And Earl just thinks you're great.
Tell her, Earl.

48:14.796 --> 48:16.457
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

48:16.531 --> 48:17.896
You're in, honey.

48:17.999 --> 48:21.730
- Come on, Bonehead. Let's go.
- Go? We just got here.

48:21.836 --> 48:25.237
I don't mean just go.
I mean go, go, go, like dance.

48:25.339 --> 48:26.863
Oh, sure!

48:38.686 --> 48:40.551
Did you ever do anything
like that, Earl?

48:40.655 --> 48:44.352
Once back in Ohio,
when I got caught in a swarm of bees.

48:48.863 --> 48:52.094
- Bonehead, you're just not with it.
- I guess you're right.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.498
Would you like to take
a walk along the beach?

48:54.569 --> 48:55.661
Sure!

49:12.019 --> 49:15.011
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
The water's so beautiful.

49:15.089 --> 49:17.717
Yeah, it sure does cool off
our dancing dogs.

49:17.792 --> 49:20.522
Yeah, it's real cool.

49:20.595 --> 49:23.564
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

49:23.631 --> 49:26.429
Music, real soft and pretty.

49:27.969 --> 49:32.030
I hear the music from the pavilion.
It's pretty, but it sure isn't soft.

49:32.106 --> 49:34.199
Well, I've been wrong before.

49:34.909 --> 49:37.469
Something bit me!
I'm getting out of here.

49:45.419 --> 49:47.410
It's a people bite!

49:48.289 --> 49:49.950
Well, what do you know?

49:51.559 --> 49:53.117
I'm late for a date.

50:00.067 --> 50:01.432
Hey, Frank.

50:01.769 --> 50:03.930
I was only kidding before
about your singing.

50:04.005 --> 50:06.940
I know you can sing.
Come on up here and prove it.

50:16.284 --> 50:18.752
<i>These are</i>

50:18.819 --> 50:24.451
<i>The good times</i>

50:24.525 --> 50:29.485
<i>While we are young</i>

50:29.597 --> 50:35.035
<i>No chance untaken</i>

50:35.136 --> 50:40.597
<i>No song unsung</i>

50:40.675 --> 50:45.874
<i>These are the good times</i>

50:45.980 --> 50:51.316
<i>Life goes your way</i>

50:51.385 --> 50:56.652
<i>Loving each moment</i>

50:56.724 --> 51:01.821
<i>Of each new day</i>

51:03.397 --> 51:08.494
<i>While the meadows are green</i>

51:08.569 --> 51:14.667
<i>Free as the wind are we</i>

51:14.742 --> 51:18.735
<i>Sharing a dream</i>

51:18.846 --> 51:22.646
<i>Living our destiny</i>

51:22.717 --> 51:27.347
<i>These are the good times</i>

51:27.421 --> 51:32.984
<i>Long as you care</i>

51:33.060 --> 51:38.498
<i>All of the good times</i>

51:38.566 --> 51:43.526
<i>We'll always share</i>

51:44.338 --> 51:46.499
I'm gonna give him a bravo.
He's terrific.

51:46.574 --> 51:48.508
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

51:48.576 --> 51:50.942
Sugar taught him everything he knows.

51:56.584 --> 52:00.452
<i>Sharing a dream</i>

52:00.554 --> 52:04.354
<i>Living our destiny</i>

52:04.425 --> 52:09.226
<i>These are the good times</i>

52:09.296 --> 52:14.859
<i>Long as you care</i>

52:14.935 --> 52:19.634
<i>All of the good times</i>

52:19.740 --> 52:22.971
<i>We'll always</i>

52:23.077 --> 52:30.040
<i>Share</i>

52:43.130 --> 52:44.596
He sings like a bird.

52:44.597 --> 52:47.794
Yeah? Well, let's see
if he can fly like one.

52:50.104 --> 52:54.473
Hey, Frankie, you'd better turn in early.
Tomorrow you make your first jump.

52:54.575 --> 52:55.803
Nice of you to let me know.

52:55.910 --> 52:58.310
Don't let him push you, Frankie.
You're not ready.

52:58.412 --> 53:00.073
Frankie does all right
at everything he tries.

53:00.147 --> 53:04.584
- I've noticed. I think he's ready.
- You're cute. Like a cobra.

53:05.119 --> 53:09.283
I'll see you tomorrow at Big Drop's,
and if you're late, I'll start without you.

53:09.356 --> 53:11.824
- Now get lost.
- Sure.

53:13.661 --> 53:16.289
Are you gonna let him
tell you what to do?

53:16.363 --> 53:20.959
- What would you have wanted me to say?
- You're not only stubborn, you're stupid.

53:23.871 --> 53:26.135
You know, she's got a point.

53:38.319 --> 53:39.513
Lorelei?

53:45.192 --> 53:46.784
Lorelei!

53:53.367 --> 53:56.803
- Frankie, this is wrong, and you know it.
- She's right, Frankie.

53:56.871 --> 54:00.500
- Let's hope not.
- He's so full of pride and integrity.

54:00.574 --> 54:02.838
Yeah, he's full of it, all right.

54:02.910 --> 54:06.505
Look, Dee Dee, I'm not gonna chicken out.
If Steve thinks I'm ready, I'm ready.

54:06.580 --> 54:09.344
- Steve, is he ready?
- It's up to Frankie.

54:09.416 --> 54:10.747
Let's go.

54:18.092 --> 54:20.026
Well, looks like I'm on.

54:20.094 --> 54:23.222
What are you waiting for, chickie baby,
to lay an egg?

54:23.497 --> 54:25.089
So long, Stevie!

54:32.273 --> 54:33.672
There he goes!

54:40.214 --> 54:43.672
Hey, that's way out.
Too much.

54:48.389 --> 54:51.256
That kid's got no guts.
I told you he was chicken.

55:11.412 --> 55:13.277
Frankie, you were just great!

55:13.380 --> 55:15.610
I couldn't have done it better myself,
if I could've done it.

55:15.716 --> 55:17.581
- Which I wouldn't.
- It was wild!

55:17.651 --> 55:20.381
Hey, where's the plane?
I want to do it again.

55:39.406 --> 55:40.930
Hello.

55:41.942 --> 55:45.503
Oh. I made it from the parachute I found
on the bottom of the ocean.

55:45.613 --> 55:47.171
Does it please you?

55:47.281 --> 55:49.442
Well, it's not that, Lorelei.

55:50.117 --> 55:53.575
Oh. Well, mermaids can have legs
for a short time on land.

55:53.654 --> 55:57.249
- I thought that would please you, too.
- You were sure right about that.

55:57.324 --> 56:00.316
- Can we sit and talk?
- Sure.

56:10.004 --> 56:12.700
There's lots of stuff
I need to know about you.

56:13.173 --> 56:15.937
You sure have pretty legs.
For a fish, that is.

56:16.010 --> 56:19.639
- How come you speak English?
- Well, mermaids speak all languages.

56:19.713 --> 56:23.149
We've helped sailors from all the ports
of the world for thousands of years.

56:23.217 --> 56:26.015
I'm not a sailor,
but I was a Sea Scout.

56:26.387 --> 56:29.823
- And I'm sure glad you helped me.
- Well, so am I,

56:29.890 --> 56:34.122
because in all my 300 years,
I've never met a human I really liked.

56:34.194 --> 56:36.492
You're 300 years old?

56:37.031 --> 56:40.159
- Gosh, you sure don't look it.
- Well, I suppose I never will.

56:40.234 --> 56:42.668
You mean you'll always look like this?

56:43.871 --> 56:44.963
Wow!

56:46.573 --> 56:49.736
Well, that means... Just wow!

56:50.844 --> 56:53.745
- How long can you keep your legs?
- Until midnight.

56:53.847 --> 56:57.010
- Then what?
- Well, then I return to the sea.

56:57.084 --> 57:00.053
- You ask too many questions.
- Just one more.

57:00.154 --> 57:01.746
Will you go out with me tonight?

57:01.855 --> 57:04.688
And I want you to meet
a couple of friends of mine. Okay?

57:04.792 --> 57:09.229
- But you won't tell them I'm a mermaid?
- Believe me, they wouldn't believe me.

57:09.330 --> 57:13.824
- I've got to buy you some clothes.
- Clothes. I'll never understand why.

57:13.901 --> 57:16.961
Neither will I.
What size do you wear?

57:17.638 --> 57:19.003
Size?

57:19.206 --> 57:22.403
Well, I guess we'll have to
work this out by hand.

57:24.812 --> 57:27.212
Now, let's see. Bust.

57:30.551 --> 57:33.213
- About like that.
- Do that again. I like it.

57:33.320 --> 57:36.346
Please, Lorelei, I'm busy.
Now, waist.

57:39.026 --> 57:40.391
About there.

57:40.761 --> 57:42.752
And hips.

57:46.166 --> 57:49.932
Well, that ought to do it.
Oh, no. Shoes.

57:51.538 --> 57:52.766
Exactly two for one.

57:52.873 --> 57:56.673
Now, you wait here, Lorelei,
and I'll bring you everything you need.

57:56.744 --> 57:59.269
Bonehead, do that first
thing again, please.

57:59.380 --> 58:00.574
Well...

58:03.417 --> 58:06.386
Lorelei, do you know
about the birds and the bees?

58:06.453 --> 58:07.511
No.

58:07.588 --> 58:10.887
Well, I better get out of here,
or you're gonna find out.

58:22.903 --> 58:25.895
- Wish me luck, Frankie!
- Look, Dee Dee, this is crazy!

58:25.973 --> 58:28.737
I was only putting you on
when I said you wouldn't jump.

58:28.809 --> 58:32.108
Oh, get buster here.
Women can't do anything.

58:32.212 --> 58:34.271
They can't jump.
They can't fly.

58:34.882 --> 58:36.941
Be my guest. I'll show you.

58:37.051 --> 58:40.214
Okay, I'll go.
Just to make sure she doesn't jump.

58:40.287 --> 58:44.121
She'll jump! She's all heart.
I'll show you I'm all heart.

58:44.224 --> 58:47.421
If her chute don't open,
she don't owe me a cent.

58:48.595 --> 58:50.722
Look, Dee Dee,
you don't have to prove anything.

58:50.798 --> 58:52.425
I believe you want to do it.

58:52.499 --> 58:55.935
I believe it, too,
and that's what I have to prove.

59:14.588 --> 59:16.681
I wonder if I'll ever get
the nerve to do that.

59:16.790 --> 59:20.282
I wouldn't advise it.
You'd have too much to lose. Me.

59:28.035 --> 59:31.300
Okay, Dee Dee, step outside
and get some fresh air.

59:32.473 --> 59:34.668
Dee Dee, you're not gonna
go through with this.

59:34.775 --> 59:38.108
You can stop me if you want to, Frankie,
but please don't.

59:38.178 --> 59:41.341
I have to do this for me.
Do you understand that?

59:58.532 --> 01:00:01.968
- Her chute didn't open!
- She's gonna do a free fall.

01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:20.584
Pull it.

01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:36.329
She made it.

01:00:36.403 --> 01:00:39.998
When a girl makes up her mind,
she gets anything she wants.

01:00:40.073 --> 01:00:43.372
- Now we're gonna talk about you?
- Us.

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:49.371
- Somebody's got to drive this thing.
- It's on automatic pilot.

01:00:49.449 --> 01:00:52.213
- Now, Bonnie, listen. I...
- You listen.

01:00:52.386 --> 01:00:55.549
Here we are, all alone,
way up high.

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:58.053
Just the two of us.

01:00:58.592 --> 01:01:04.053
- Yeah, but somebody down there likes me.
- Well, somebody up here likes you, too.

01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:06.456
Bonnie, you may have turned it
on automatic pilot,

01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:08.228
but I'm not on the same switch.

01:01:08.302 --> 01:01:11.135
You don't get all your kicks
from surfing, do you?

01:01:11.238 --> 01:01:13.968
Well, of course not,
but this is ridiculous.

01:01:14.074 --> 01:01:15.939
It's really wild up there.

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:18.443
She's got the plane on automatic pilot.

01:01:21.114 --> 01:01:24.311
- But why?
- It's hard to fly with your arms full.

01:01:24.418 --> 01:01:27.615
- No dice, Frankie?
- I'm not even in the game.

01:01:28.755 --> 01:01:31.781
Well, I just dealt you in.

01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:34.620
Steve won't like this very much.

01:01:34.728 --> 01:01:38.494
Look, Bonnie, you're a nice kid.
You don't need all this phony jazz.

01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:41.295
I'm not used to having people
say no to me.

01:01:41.401 --> 01:01:42.493
Well, that's the trouble.

01:01:42.603 --> 01:01:44.833
If more people said no,
you wouldn't act like this.

01:01:44.938 --> 01:01:46.428
I'm gonna break him in two.

01:01:46.506 --> 01:01:50.272
There's something you should know.
Frankie's small, but he's wiry.

01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:55.241
Steve!

01:01:55.315 --> 01:01:57.283
Oh, Steve, I just can't tell you
what happened!

01:01:57.351 --> 01:01:58.443
I can.

01:01:58.518 --> 01:02:01.316
It was terrible, and there I was, helpless,
all alone up there.

01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:03.753
- I suppose he put it on automatic pilot?
- Steve, he forced me.

01:02:03.824 --> 01:02:05.348
- Come off it, Bonnie.
- Hey, why don't you wise up?

01:02:05.459 --> 01:02:07.154
Keep out of this.
Nobody makes a monkey out of me.

01:02:07.261 --> 01:02:09.923
Now, wait a second. You listen to me.
This whole thing is your fault.

01:02:09.997 --> 01:02:11.589
If you'd get off
the jealous kick with Bonnie,

01:02:11.665 --> 01:02:12.825
she wouldn't be looking around.

01:02:12.933 --> 01:02:15.458
It's not me she's interested in,
or anybody else. It's you.

01:02:15.535 --> 01:02:17.002
That's right. You.

01:02:17.371 --> 01:02:21.205
She just wants proof you care about her,
and this is her way of getting it.

01:02:21.308 --> 01:02:23.503
So if you really care,
you ought to let her know it

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.544
and knock off the silly games.

01:02:30.617 --> 01:02:33.814
- Maybe he's right.
- He may be right, but he's gonna be sorry.

01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:36.947
Nobody makes
a monkey out of Steve but Steve.

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:42.393
Well, I hope it fits.

01:02:42.496 --> 01:02:45.954
The lady in the store
was real nice about making sure.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.360
Okay.

01:02:51.138 --> 01:02:54.164
- You like it?
- Wait till the gang sees you.

01:02:54.241 --> 01:02:55.333
Let's go!

01:02:56.176 --> 01:02:57.336
High heels.

01:02:57.978 --> 01:03:00.071
You shouldn't wear them
in the sand, anyway.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.306
Here.

01:03:01.715 --> 01:03:04.343
You will have to forgive me.
It's my first time, you know.

01:03:04.418 --> 01:03:05.578
Yeah, I know the feeling.

01:03:05.686 --> 01:03:09.850
I remember the first time I wore shoes.
It was about a year ago.

01:03:16.763 --> 01:03:18.731
<i>They go a lot of places</i>

01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:22.563
<i>And they have a lot of fun</i>

01:03:22.669 --> 01:03:24.364
<i>Hill climbing in the mountains</i>

01:03:24.438 --> 01:03:27.532
<i>Or for a desert run</i>

01:03:27.607 --> 01:03:29.768
<i>And when I get a little bike</i>

01:03:29.876 --> 01:03:31.400
<i>Now, you can just bet</i>

01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:37.347
<i>I'm gonna be a member of the cycle set</i>

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:38.884
<i>I'm gonna take my money</i>

01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:42.921
<i>And I'm gonna put it away</i>

01:03:43.023 --> 01:03:46.550
<i>And bank every paycheck
when it comes to payday</i>

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.752
Dance.

01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:50.091
<i>I'm gonna pay it up in cash</i>

01:03:50.197 --> 01:03:51.755
<i>So I won't be in debt</i>

01:03:51.865 --> 01:03:53.492
<i>Then we'll ride my bike</i>

01:03:53.567 --> 01:03:57.833
<i>With the cycle set</i>

01:04:08.081 --> 01:04:12.415
<i>Of the cycle set</i>

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:17.957
<i>I saw a little bike
and the price was just right</i>

01:04:18.058 --> 01:04:19.685
<i>So I'm gonna take my money</i>

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.923
<i>And I'll pick it up tonight</i>

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:25.259
<i>And I'm with a real pretty chick</i>

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:26.764
<i>That I just met</i>

01:04:26.867 --> 01:04:29.199
<i>We're gonna ride together
with the cycle set</i>

01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:30.702
Come on, Dee Dee, let's dance.

01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:32.864
- Let's go, Lorelei.
- Bonehead?

01:04:32.939 --> 01:04:36.534
Gee, I don't feel like a bonehead with you.
I feel different.

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:38.703
Tell me more about the
birds and the bees.

01:04:38.779 --> 01:04:42.044
Well, it's like when
you get a certain feeling coming over you.

01:04:42.115 --> 01:04:45.050
- You mean, like falling in love?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:04:45.118 --> 01:04:48.645
And I'm beginning to get it now.
Maybe we'd better dance.

01:04:49.923 --> 01:04:51.891
<i>I'm gonna ride my cycle</i>

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:55.052
<i>With the cycle set</i>

01:04:55.128 --> 01:04:58.222
If that's dancing,
I'm afraid I can't do it.

01:04:58.298 --> 01:05:02.234
Well, when this is over,
I'll ask him to play something slower.

01:05:02.302 --> 01:05:07.262
<i>We're gonna ride my cycle
with the cycle set</i>

01:05:20.954 --> 01:05:23.684
Earl, I don't know
why you're so crazy about this place.

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:26.315
I just want to do a
little more research.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.361
- Which girl is it, Earl?
- Oh, come on now.

01:05:42.676 --> 01:05:44.644
They must've raided the place.

01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:47.041
We'll sit over here, Earl.

01:05:50.817 --> 01:05:53.513
That's indecent.
They're touching each other.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.214
I knew there was something
about it I liked.

01:06:55.448 --> 01:06:59.714
Why me?
Why me all the time?

01:07:03.256 --> 01:07:07.215
It's a shame there wasn't soap in it.
It would've been his first bath.

01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:11.620
Hey, that was nifty, boss.

01:07:12.799 --> 01:07:17.027
You see anything funny in that?

01:07:18.705 --> 01:07:21.071
- She likes it.
- What?

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.105
It's the Black Plague.

01:07:28.315 --> 01:07:30.715
Do you find this type
of fun relaxing?

01:07:32.485 --> 01:07:33.884
Start the music!

01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:43.156
Where's Sugar?
Where's my idol?

01:07:43.263 --> 01:07:45.925
- She ain't here, boss.
- Yeah, we been looking around.

01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:48.627
Later we will go get her
'cause I adore her.

01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:03.670
Hey, boss, look!

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:07.616
I seen his pictures in the column
in the newspaper I read to you every day.

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:11.088
That's Earl Wilson.
You know, Earl's Pearls.

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.186
Oh, sure!

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:19.298
Hey, Earl, how about tossing a pearl?

01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:21.328
Before swine?

01:08:22.368 --> 01:08:25.361
That's good.
Right like that, he... Him, I like.

01:08:25.471 --> 01:08:27.770
You just lost a lot of points, Earl.

01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:31.207
Please, do not destroy my mood.
Tonight, I even like you.

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:34.508
Oh, perfect.
I'll save the next dance for you.

01:08:34.981 --> 01:08:36.038
I lead.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:39.380
Come on.
Let's go find my idol.

01:08:40.553 --> 01:08:43.488
- It's almost time.
- Oh, yeah. We gotta be going.

01:08:43.555 --> 01:08:46.149
Do you have to leave so early?
We're just getting acquainted.

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:48.694
Well, I promised Lorelei
I'd get her home before midnight.

01:08:48.795 --> 01:08:51.696
What, does she turn into a pumpkin
or something?

01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:53.358
Something like that.

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:55.832
It was nice knowing you.
I hope to see you again.

01:08:55.902 --> 01:08:56.993
- Thank you.
- It's nice meeting you.

01:08:57.069 --> 01:09:00.163
- Nice meeting you.
- Oh, come on, Goo Goo.

01:09:00.974 --> 01:09:02.066
Good night.

01:09:02.175 --> 01:09:03.301
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:09:03.376 --> 01:09:06.209
- Bye.
- She's a nice girl.

01:09:06.312 --> 01:09:08.974
Yeah, but there's something
strange about her.

01:09:09.049 --> 01:09:13.417
I don't know. She just seems out of place.
Like a fish out of water.

01:09:44.718 --> 01:09:47.185
Okay, now, everybody quiet.

01:09:47.353 --> 01:09:51.345
I don't want nobody to wake up my idol
until I wake her up myself.

01:09:51.957 --> 01:09:53.618
'Cause I adore her.

01:09:53.727 --> 01:09:55.251
- Right?
- Right!

01:09:55.361 --> 01:09:56.726
Quiet, will you?

01:10:16.282 --> 01:10:19.513
You stupids! This ain't no way
to run a kidnapping.

01:10:19.586 --> 01:10:20.951
Sorry, boss.

01:10:21.087 --> 01:10:22.850
Do like I do and you
will learn things.

01:10:22.922 --> 01:10:24.856
Jerome, fix it.

01:10:29.863 --> 01:10:31.524
Follow your leader.

01:10:32.932 --> 01:10:36.060
My hat. Where's my hat?
My hat.

01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:56.317
Be quiet. Quiet.

01:11:08.067 --> 01:11:11.764
Next time I bring you stupids along,
I will go by myself.

01:11:15.742 --> 01:11:18.176
My idol fell asleep with the TV on.

01:11:35.261 --> 01:11:37.786
Marlo Brandon never
looked like this.

01:11:38.665 --> 01:11:40.257
Get her some clothes.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.766
I don't want no idol of mine to freeze,
'cause I adore her.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.704
What are you doing?

01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:57.983
I'm glad you asked that question,

01:11:58.051 --> 01:12:01.111
because I, Eric Von Zipper,
am putting the snatch on you.

01:12:01.187 --> 01:12:02.313
Snatch?

01:12:02.388 --> 01:12:07.325
Yeah. I'm kidnapping you,
only it's more romantic, like eloping.

01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:12.188
- Did Bullets think this up?
- I, Eric Von Zipper, thunk it up.

01:12:12.899 --> 01:12:15.663
- I think it's marvy.
- Nifty.

01:12:17.136 --> 01:12:18.831
- You need any help, boss?
- No!

01:12:18.905 --> 01:12:20.702
I'd rather do it myself.

01:12:23.009 --> 01:12:25.477
Whoa. I may... Gee, she's...

01:12:25.545 --> 01:12:27.513
Help me. Help me!

01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:35.181
I've always worn this.
Now I want you to wear it.

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:42.222
Bonehead, I love you.

01:12:42.662 --> 01:12:46.564
You said what I was gonna say.
Only, why so sad?

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.663
- Because we have to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

01:12:50.737 --> 01:12:52.068
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.706 --> 01:12:56.174
If I didn't love you,
it would be easy.

01:12:56.242 --> 01:13:00.941
But if we love each other,
why can't we take what we have now?

01:13:01.047 --> 01:13:02.571
Don't tempt me.

01:13:03.249 --> 01:13:05.740
The memory of it would haunt
me for the rest of my life,

01:13:05.852 --> 01:13:07.877
and for me, that's a long time.

01:13:10.056 --> 01:13:11.353
You know I'm right.

01:13:11.424 --> 01:13:14.120
You are what you are,
and I am what I am.

01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:16.418
We just don't belong.

01:13:35.982 --> 01:13:37.244
Lorelei.

01:13:39.953 --> 01:13:42.285
Please don't.
I'm going home now.

01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:45.943
Easy, easy. That was good.
This time you even hit the white ball.

01:14:46.019 --> 01:14:48.544
See? You're learning.
I bet you them beach bums

01:14:48.654 --> 01:14:51.214
ain't never been
in a decent pool hall in their lives.

01:14:51.324 --> 01:14:55.351
Are we playing pool, bubby,
or is this all a lousy dream?

01:14:56.329 --> 01:14:58.490
There happens to be a lady present.

01:14:58.698 --> 01:15:01.394
- I apologize.
- That's nice.

01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:04.834
And after you learn pool,
I'm gonna learn you how to cycle.

01:15:04.904 --> 01:15:07.873
You're gonna become
Eric Von Zipper's progidy.

01:15:07.974 --> 01:15:11.410
- It all sounds marvy.
- Yeah, nifty.

01:15:12.712 --> 01:15:14.873
Hey, how would you like a malted?

01:15:15.014 --> 01:15:16.504
Sounds super!

01:15:17.417 --> 01:15:20.250
Well, why are you standing here?
The lady wants a malted.

01:15:20.353 --> 01:15:23.584
Get her a malted!
And make it a double!

01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:25.352
A double!

01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:36.529
All right, out with it.
What did you do with her?

01:15:36.736 --> 01:15:38.226
I didn't do anything.

01:15:38.337 --> 01:15:41.898
She went under this wave,
and that was the last time I saw her.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:45.609
He drowned her.
This brute drowned Sugar Kane!

01:15:45.711 --> 01:15:48.942
- Sugar? Who's talking about her?
- Sugar's missing?

01:15:49.048 --> 01:15:52.176
I missed her at 8:00 a. m. bed checks.
She's gone!

01:15:52.251 --> 01:15:54.185
Know anything about it, Bonehead?

01:15:54.253 --> 01:15:55.686
Just 'cause I was burying clothes

01:15:55.755 --> 01:15:57.848
doesn't mean
I know anything about Sugar.

01:15:57.924 --> 01:15:59.289
Burying clothes?

01:15:59.392 --> 01:16:01.622
It is kind of a coincidence.
You have to admit that.

01:16:01.727 --> 01:16:04.525
Those were Lorelei's clothes.
Lorelei, the mermaid.

01:16:04.597 --> 01:16:07.725
- Mermaid?
- Oh, Lorelei's a mermaid.

01:16:09.102 --> 01:16:12.902
Sure. She took her clothes off
and went back into the ocean.

01:16:12.972 --> 01:16:15.805
I didn't know what to do
with her clothes, so...

01:16:16.442 --> 01:16:19.741
- Oh, what's the use?
- What's the use?

01:16:19.812 --> 01:16:22.303
Relax, Bullets. It's all my fault.

01:16:22.415 --> 01:16:25.976
Sugar and I cooked it up
between ourselves for a publicity gag.

01:16:26.452 --> 01:16:28.613
Drowning as publicity?

01:16:29.455 --> 01:16:33.050
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Look, nobody drowned anybody.

01:16:33.126 --> 01:16:36.789
Headlines. "Girl singer disappears.
Found by boy surfers. "

01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:39.126
Good for you and
good for us, right?

01:16:39.532 --> 01:16:40.760
Perfect.

01:16:41.434 --> 01:16:44.631
I should've thought of it myself.
Now, where is she?

01:16:44.737 --> 01:16:47.262
Give it a few more hours,
and you'll have her back. I promise.

01:16:47.373 --> 01:16:50.467
She'll be on the beach this afternoon
right after Frankie and I do our free fall.

01:16:50.576 --> 01:16:52.237
She will?
I mean, she will.

01:16:52.311 --> 01:16:55.747
You know something?
You're a good kid, kid.

01:16:56.749 --> 01:16:59.149
I'll get right to the papers,
and if anybody asks,

01:16:59.252 --> 01:17:01.243
I did think of it myself.

01:17:03.556 --> 01:17:06.821
- All right, Bonehead. Now, where is she?
- Well, I thought you said you knew.

01:17:06.926 --> 01:17:08.791
I only made up that jazz
to get rid of Bullets.

01:17:08.895 --> 01:17:10.157
Now, come on. Let's have it.

01:17:10.263 --> 01:17:13.824
Look, Frankie, I'm being honest.
I don't know anything about Sugar.

01:17:13.933 --> 01:17:17.334
I took Lorelei home last night
and we said goodbye.

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:21.467
Bonehead, Frankie is only trying to help.
He's your friend.

01:17:25.845 --> 01:17:29.804
- He's not even listening!
- Listening? Sure I am.

01:17:30.283 --> 01:17:32.843
- Don't you hear it?
- Hear what?

01:17:33.352 --> 01:17:34.614
So long.

01:17:35.154 --> 01:17:36.348
- See you later.
- Wait a second.

01:17:36.455 --> 01:17:40.516
Don't forget what we told Bullets.
This afternoon, she'd better be here.

01:18:06.652 --> 01:18:08.176
"Von Zipper?"

01:18:14.327 --> 01:18:16.557
That's it.
And with my help,

01:18:16.662 --> 01:18:19.961
you're gonna be the best lady pool player
in this entire pool room.

01:18:20.032 --> 01:18:21.363
Marvy!

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:24.727
- Before the Rats come back...
- The mice want to play.

01:18:25.204 --> 01:18:28.196
- We could kill that kid.
- That's the idea.

01:18:28.407 --> 01:18:30.898
Leave it to old Slim. I got ideas,

01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:33.535
and they're all vile, baby.

01:18:33.746 --> 01:18:35.543
- Marvy!
- Marvy!

01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:42.344
You're a regular Minnesota Fats.

01:18:42.421 --> 01:18:44.514
It's all right, Sugar, I'm here.

01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:48.856
- You stupid! I was here first.
- And you're gonna stay here.

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:50.996
Why me? Why always me?

01:18:52.164 --> 01:18:53.529
Let's go, Sugar.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.266
You're gonna stay here,
too, bubby.

01:18:58.738 --> 01:19:00.569
Come to your daddy.

01:19:00.673 --> 01:19:03.164
I'm gonna take you to
my bubby house.

01:19:03.609 --> 01:19:05.338
There you go, baby.

01:19:10.349 --> 01:19:12.681
I think I'm gonna need some help.

01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:19.350
- Anything new with Bonehead?
- Nothing, and I'm worried about him.

01:19:19.425 --> 01:19:21.586
It's you two I'm worried about.

01:19:21.927 --> 01:19:24.054
Steve's still wigged about Frankie.

01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:26.098
Well, why don't you take us up?

01:19:26.198 --> 01:19:29.429
I already suggested that
to Steve. No go.

01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:34.433
- Oh, what can he do?
- There's a lot he can do.

01:19:40.479 --> 01:19:42.242
Hey, here they come!

01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:47.382
Frankie, I'm worried.

01:19:47.453 --> 01:19:49.978
Do you think
Bonnie might have been right?

01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:54.289
My girl's worried.
Any reason she should be?

01:19:54.393 --> 01:19:56.987
No reason at all.
Or for you, either.

01:19:57.997 --> 01:20:00.488
First one down's a rotten skydiver.

01:20:09.041 --> 01:20:11.908
Look at that! Too much.

01:20:27.159 --> 01:20:28.751
Oh, out of sight!

01:20:38.671 --> 01:20:40.036
We gotta try it.

01:20:52.451 --> 01:20:55.511
- Open! Open those chutes!
- What's the matter?

01:20:55.621 --> 01:20:58.886
At the speed they're falling,
that water's like concrete.

01:21:22.014 --> 01:21:23.675
That's groovy.

01:21:23.749 --> 01:21:26.183
Not so groovy.
They opened too late.

01:21:26.252 --> 01:21:28.311
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

01:22:09.428 --> 01:22:10.690
Lorelei.

01:22:20.139 --> 01:22:21.367
Lorelei!

01:23:10.456 --> 01:23:13.254
Hey, Frankie, skydiving's groovy,
but let's stick to surfing.

01:23:13.325 --> 01:23:14.622
Yeah.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.450
You know something?

01:23:17.596 --> 01:23:19.757
A kiss is worth more
than a thousand words.

01:23:19.832 --> 01:23:21.993
Then why don't you stop talking?

01:23:28.607 --> 01:23:30.666
- All right, where is she?
- Where's who?

01:23:30.776 --> 01:23:31.936
You know very well who.

01:23:32.011 --> 01:23:33.501
I mean, I brought Earl here
because you said...

01:23:33.612 --> 01:23:37.104
Frankie, I found Sugar.
They've got her at that pool hall.

01:23:37.182 --> 01:23:39.582
- Who's got her?
- Von Zipper's got her.

01:23:39.652 --> 01:23:40.812
Von Zipper?

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.753
The Rat Pack social director.
And you promised me...

01:23:43.822 --> 01:23:46.620
And I'm gonna keep my promise.
Okay, you guys, let's go!

01:23:46.692 --> 01:23:48.319
Cowabunga!

01:23:51.597 --> 01:23:55.033
- "Cowabunga?"
- I don't know, Earl, but let's go.

01:23:57.202 --> 01:24:00.103
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Watch it, boss.

01:24:00.306 --> 01:24:04.800
Where is my idol and South Dakota Slim
and my two mice, Puss 'n' Boots?

01:24:04.877 --> 01:24:06.139
First you win the game for me, boss,

01:24:06.211 --> 01:24:07.803
and then when
you're nice and relaxed, I'll tell you.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.108
Oh, okay.

01:24:09.848 --> 01:24:10.974
Watch this.

01:24:20.392 --> 01:24:22.553
There they are.
Let's rack them up!

01:25:19.952 --> 01:25:23.080
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
What are we fighting about?

01:25:23.188 --> 01:25:25.247
You've got Sugar!
Where is she?

01:25:25.357 --> 01:25:27.757
- I ain't got Sugar. Where is she?
- I was gonna tell you, boss.

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:30.852
I got a hunch South Dakota Slim
took her to his bubby house.

01:25:30.929 --> 01:25:32.396
- You mean the old sawmill?
- Yeah.

01:25:32.464 --> 01:25:35.627
Sawmill? Why, it's right out
of The Perils of Pauline.

01:25:35.734 --> 01:25:37.201
It's Pearl White revisited.

01:25:37.269 --> 01:25:38.896
We'll see you later.

01:25:38.971 --> 01:25:41.371
Follow me. Whistle, whistle.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.907
That's Earl, brother.

01:25:42.975 --> 01:25:45.409
Yeah, Earl, while there's still a door.

01:25:50.449 --> 01:25:53.247
- Whistle.
- Get them, guys!

01:27:00.552 --> 01:27:03.646
Why me?
Why me all the time?

01:28:58.425 --> 01:29:00.086
Tasty.

01:29:03.507 --> 01:29:06.271
Now the show starts, bubbies.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.446
Fine. Fine! Fine!

01:29:14.485 --> 01:29:18.319
You know, the name of this
game is murder, bubbies.

01:29:20.257 --> 01:29:22.987
Oh, fine.
This is gonna be good.

01:29:23.093 --> 01:29:28.156
I seen this in my favorite picture,
The Perils of Pauline.

01:29:30.934 --> 01:29:33.198
I don't think this is very nice.

01:29:33.771 --> 01:29:35.830
No, I think it's kind of mean.

01:29:37.508 --> 01:29:41.069
Hold it!
No one can criticize old Slim.

01:29:41.145 --> 01:29:45.946
I'll show you old Slim
hasn't got a mean bone in his body.

01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:49.847
I'm gonna apply
the anesthesia to you, darling.

01:29:50.154 --> 01:29:54.887
I've got hasenpfeffer.
I've got a little bit of...

01:29:56.527 --> 01:29:58.290
There she is.

01:29:58.362 --> 01:30:02.765
This anesthesia works
every time, bubby.

01:30:05.702 --> 01:30:07.033
Come on, Sugar, let's go!

01:30:07.137 --> 01:30:09.697
Yeah, we may be rotten, Sug,
but we're not this rotten.

01:30:14.678 --> 01:30:16.441
It works every time.

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:25.220
What are you doing
with my bubby there?

01:30:25.622 --> 01:30:29.615
Step aside, ladies.
That's my Sugar, bubbies.

01:30:30.828 --> 01:30:34.457
- You give me back my idol! Right?
- Right!

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.226
- Bull's-eye.
- Hey, boss!

01:30:40.838 --> 01:30:42.237
Come on!

01:30:43.073 --> 01:30:46.236
Sugar, your daddy's gonna
take you to his new lab!

01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:48.334
Come on, my little bauble.

01:30:51.248 --> 01:30:52.909
- Come here!
- Boss?

01:30:55.018 --> 01:30:56.645
Nobody takes my Sugar!

01:31:01.558 --> 01:31:03.492
Now you've got yours, bubby!

01:31:04.228 --> 01:31:05.559
Why, you...

01:31:09.766 --> 01:31:13.600
I'm the king bubby around here!
Come right up and get me!

01:31:13.704 --> 01:31:15.604
Where's my little Sugar?

01:31:20.277 --> 01:31:23.508
You watch your daddy
operate now, Sugar.

01:31:35.526 --> 01:31:38.927
Come on, bubbies!
Hey, bubby!

01:31:39.029 --> 01:31:40.587
Here's your daddy!

01:31:42.299 --> 01:31:46.065
Come here!
Come on, now! Come on, man!

01:31:56.613 --> 01:31:59.605
Why me?
Why me all the time?

01:32:05.489 --> 01:32:08.583
I'm gonna give you a little
entertainment. Yeah!

01:32:15.332 --> 01:32:16.424
Sugar.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.300
- You all right?
- My hero!

01:32:21.138 --> 01:32:24.130
I do all the work and he
gets all the credit.

01:32:25.142 --> 01:32:26.803
Well, that's life.

01:32:28.779 --> 01:32:32.840
Why are you hitting? Stop hitting me!
Will you let go? You stupids!

01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:35.317
Okay, let's go.

01:32:49.032 --> 01:32:50.499
What a story.

01:32:50.667 --> 01:32:54.159
Surfer saves singer. Singer saves surfer.

01:32:54.638 --> 01:32:56.128
Surfer saves...

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.801
I'll let Earl string these pearls.

01:33:02.045 --> 01:33:03.342
Bonehead,

01:33:04.281 --> 01:33:05.714
about that mermaid...

01:33:05.816 --> 01:33:09.183
I was kidding.
There never was any mermaid.

01:33:09.286 --> 01:33:13.985
The girl who pulled me in this afternoon,
she asked me to give you this.

01:33:18.195 --> 01:33:20.026
Oh, here comes Boney.

01:33:22.232 --> 01:33:24.496
- Hi, Sugar.
- Hi.

01:33:26.536 --> 01:33:28.970
This is so romantic, Bonehead.

01:33:29.172 --> 01:33:32.699
It's like we were brought together
by some mystery of the sea.

01:33:33.076 --> 01:33:35.806
I knew he was stupid,
but sickening, too?

01:33:41.485 --> 01:33:43.510
Was there really a mermaid?

01:33:44.755 --> 01:33:47.519
Is there a moon? Is there a sky?

01:33:47.924 --> 01:33:49.357
Are there dreams?

01:34:01.571 --> 01:34:08.571
