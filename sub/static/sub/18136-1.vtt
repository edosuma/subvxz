TO THE FOURTH CENTURY.
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

- UH, HE'S SPENDING THE NIGHT
WITH A FRIEND.

CLEAR THE ROAD AND SLOWLY
INTRODUCE EXIT SIGNS.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.310
THAT'S FUNNY.

HE WAS VERY UPSET,

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.965

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:25.149

ARE GREAT, SWEETHEART.

WHERE I WAS BORN, DR. WONG,

WAS LESS COMPLICATED.

IN FACT.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.666

IN THE NEXT TOWN...

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.001
AND OUR PARENTS
WANTED TO JOIN FARMS.
