WEBVTT

00:23.791 --> 00:25.426
My name is Dylan Resnick.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.229
Three nights ago,
my wife went for a jog.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.363
She never came home.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.700
If anyone has any information
on Alison's whereabouts,

00:32.733 --> 00:34.168
please, come forward.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.838
Elizabeth, Alison's mother,
and I,

00:37.871 --> 00:39.107
we just want her home.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.142
(rhythmic breathing)

00:50.651 --> 00:52.653
(engine starting)

00:52.686 --> 00:53.921
DYLAN:
Alison and I met

00:53.954 --> 00:57.658
freshman year of high school,
and I fell in love immediately.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.394
She is the sweetest,

01:00.428 --> 01:03.097
most kind-hearted person
that I've ever known.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.599
I don't know why anyone
would want to hurt her.

01:05.633 --> 01:10.138
Ali, if you can hear me...

01:10.171 --> 01:11.372
I love you.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.742
I can't imagine my life
without you.

01:14.775 --> 01:15.843
(Alison moans)

01:20.314 --> 01:22.416
These last few days
have been hell,

01:22.450 --> 01:23.417
and I've been looking for you.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.418
I've been looking for you

01:24.452 --> 01:25.419
since you disappeared,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.321
and I'm not going to stop.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.222
I'm going to find you.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.164
(men talking indistinctly,
dogs barking)

01:36.197 --> 01:38.499
Seek, seek. Seek.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.100
MAN (over radio):
Yeah, we're going to need
a couple more units.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.738
OFFICER:
Yeah, clear over here!

01:48.609 --> 01:49.843
(dog whining)

01:49.877 --> 01:51.679
OFFICER 2:
Come on, Shaky, come on now.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.247
Nothing here!

01:54.548 --> 01:56.784
(groans)

01:56.817 --> 01:58.919
(grunts)

01:58.952 --> 02:00.254
Hey, guys, over here!

02:01.589 --> 02:03.591
What you got?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.860
OFFICER 3:
Go this way.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.429
OFFICER 1:
Hey, Tom, over here.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.264
Come on, come on.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.365
OFFICER 2: Yeah, on my way.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.866
You pick something up?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.802
OFFICER 1:
Yeah.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.339
*

02:46.934 --> 02:48.369
Looks like Alison
Resnick's wearable

02:48.402 --> 02:49.770
was carrying
a whole bunch of code

02:49.803 --> 02:51.539
that the manufacturer
never intended.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.341
Malware.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.943
Whoever wrote this malware
is Alison's killer.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.681
(shuddering)

03:00.714 --> 03:03.251
Hey, keep the
change, thank you.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.220
D.B. Russell, you are aware that

03:06.254 --> 03:08.956
work starts at 8:00 a.m.,
not 8:13.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.391
Yeah, I know,
I'm sorry.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.625
Uh, there was a...

03:11.659 --> 03:13.394
A woman.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.828
(laughing):
A what?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.331
You've been working at Cyber
for five months.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.467
You haven't been
late, not once.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.936
Now in the span of a week,
you've been late three times.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.538
Come on, who is she?

03:24.572 --> 03:27.641
No, no, no, no, no,
it's this winter weather.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.942
I'm not used to it.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.278
It's slowing me down.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.412
Come on, there's
a spring in your step,

03:31.445 --> 03:33.681
you got a grin a mile wide.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.782
You, sir, are smitten.

03:34.815 --> 03:35.783
Who is she?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.885
Oh...

03:37.918 --> 03:40.488
her name is Greer Latimore,

03:40.521 --> 03:42.390
and I got to tell you, like, um,

03:42.423 --> 03:45.559
like Nelson would say,
I'm really feeling it.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.428
(laughs)

03:47.461 --> 03:51.765
She's a very attractive, um,
former secret service agent.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.966
Wow, that's impressive.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.967
Mm.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.269
Well, I guess that means

03:55.303 --> 03:56.470
our plans are off for Friday.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.706
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
we're going.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.040
Come on, you kidding me?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.009
Cal versus Georgetown?

04:02.042 --> 04:03.677
Friday night, two seats,
courtside.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.678
Come on.

04:04.712 --> 04:05.713
You should take Greer.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.780
To watch my Bears

04:06.814 --> 04:08.782
dismantle your Hoyas?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.651
No, no, it's you and me, missy.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.853
You are aware,
I never went to Georgetown.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.423
You live a block
from the university.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.424
Technically,

04:16.457 --> 04:17.758
that makes
them your team.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.427
True.
The Hoyas

04:19.460 --> 04:20.728
versus the Bears.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.930
They-they haven't played
since 1907.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.964
It's gonna be huge.

04:23.997 --> 04:24.965
I'll bring the tissue.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.400
Trust me, you're
gonna need them.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.368
No, I'm not.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.002
Yes, I will win.
No, I'm gonna throw you out.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.003
I'm gonna whoop you.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.071
What?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.906
I don't know, a little
something... a little wager.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.007
A little side bet?

04:34.041 --> 04:34.808
Come on.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.610
You guys ready
for something new?

04:36.644 --> 04:37.778
Krumitz found
malicious code

04:37.811 --> 04:40.013
on Alison Resnick's
fitness band.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.982
All right, malicious code

04:42.015 --> 04:43.884
in a wearable.
Every time

04:43.917 --> 04:46.754
a new device comes out,
black hats race to be

04:46.787 --> 04:47.855
the first to hack it.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.358
Yeah, well, maybe
you'll consider that

04:50.391 --> 04:52.593
the next time you look at my
purchase order of gadgets.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.495
She thinks I'm just buying toys.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.363
I'm actually

04:55.396 --> 04:56.430
doing research

04:56.464 --> 04:58.031
to find and stop
the next attack.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.769
Was Krumitz able to recover
any data from the fitness band?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.571
Ah, not yet.
The device was damaged.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.706
MUNDO:
The wearable's chip
was smashed and waterlogged,

05:05.739 --> 05:07.074
but Krumitz has promised
to bring it back to life.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.076
Well, this was not
a robbery turned homicide.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.578
No thief would leave

05:10.611 --> 05:12.045
a diamond ring
like that behind.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.046
This is interesting.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.081
Alison's cause of death--

05:14.114 --> 05:15.082
blunt-force trauma
to the head,

05:15.115 --> 05:18.452
but they also found
bruising on her lower back.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.921
Traces of Propofol
in her system.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.122
That's a sedative.

05:22.155 --> 05:26.594
An injection site was a median
vein on her left forearm.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.062
Our killer had access
to pharmaceutical-grade drugs

05:29.096 --> 05:30.398
and knew where
to inject Alison

05:30.431 --> 05:31.665
to sedate her quickly.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.700
Target could be a doctor.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.402
Or a veterinarian.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.836
Alison's husband,
Dylan Resnick,

05:35.869 --> 05:36.837
is a veterinarian.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.506
Medical knowledge and Propofol

05:38.539 --> 05:39.973
might make him
our prime suspect.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.511
NELSON:
All right,

05:43.544 --> 05:45.579
local FBI field office
imaged every device

05:45.613 --> 05:46.747
found in the
Resnicks' home.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.748
Cell phones,

05:47.781 --> 05:49.049
laptops, tablets, the router.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.784
I mean, they sent us everything.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.820
What about
Dylan Resnick's phone?
NELSON: Yeah, well,

05:52.853 --> 05:53.754
that's where things
get interesting.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.523
It was powered off
for about three hours,

05:55.556 --> 05:59.026
so, from 8:33 to about 11:30
that night.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.462
And most people can't go without
their phone for ten minutes.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.131
Three hours--
it's a very long time,

06:04.164 --> 06:05.733
especially when your wife
has gone missing.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.601
Gives you enough time
to murder your wife

06:07.635 --> 06:09.102
and throw the body in a field.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.137
Raven thinks that

06:10.170 --> 06:11.138
the husband is guilty.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.407
Did you see the way
Alison's mother, Elizabeth,

06:13.441 --> 06:15.876
was looking at him during
his heartfelt press conference?

06:15.909 --> 06:16.810
In cases like these,

06:16.844 --> 06:19.112
it's the husband
more than 50% of the time.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.147
Raven's right.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.650
Dylan was the last person
to see Alison alive,

06:22.683 --> 06:24.485
and neighbors heard
them fighting minutes
before Alison's run.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.719
RYAN:
We don't have to speculate.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.721
Resnick's devices
will lead us to the truth.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.656
We're still
recovering data,

06:28.689 --> 06:30.424
but we should have
some answers shortly.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.859
Hey, guys.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.594
I can finally name
the flavor of malicious code

06:33.627 --> 06:34.895
on Alison's wearable.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.497
It's spyware.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.499
It allowed our target
to track where she was

06:38.532 --> 06:40.468
at all times.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.735
92% of divorce attorneys
said that their clients

06:41.769 --> 06:43.203
have used spyware
on their spouse.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.006
And guess who bought Alison
a fitness band for Christmas.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.040
Her husband.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.075
Just because

06:48.108 --> 06:49.109
Dylan bought her the device

06:49.142 --> 06:50.110
doesn't mean he put

06:50.143 --> 06:51.311
the spyware on it.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.447
Do we know how the malware
was loaded onto the wearable?

06:53.481 --> 06:54.314
No.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.584
No, when, where,
and how the spyware got

06:56.617 --> 06:58.085
onto the fitness band
is still a mystery.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.953
NELSON:
Hey, guys, check this out.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.489
Alison's husband

07:01.522 --> 07:03.491
is being taken in
for questioning.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.492
KRUMITZ:
Based on

07:04.525 --> 07:05.425
what evidence?

07:05.459 --> 07:07.127
We're still dissecting
Alison's wearable.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.729
Alison's from Charleston.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.230
She's loved by everybody
in her hometown.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.932
Police are probably scrambling.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.901
The public's demanding
a suspect to blame.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.669
Look at his eyes.

07:15.703 --> 07:16.904
RAMIREZ:
He's guilty.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.039
NELSON: He ain't guilty. He's
practically in tears, Raven.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.941
I mean, the man just
lost his wife.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.009
It's ironic.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.144
The device that Alison was using

07:24.177 --> 07:26.179
to improve her health...

07:26.213 --> 07:28.181
it's also the same device
that's gonna allow us

07:28.215 --> 07:29.216
to catch her killer.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.525
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

07:37.558 --> 07:43.697
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

07:45.599 --> 07:51.939
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

07:51.972 --> 07:55.142
* I can see
for miles and miles *

07:55.175 --> 07:59.179
* I can see for miles

07:59.212 --> 08:03.517
* I can see
for miles and miles *

08:03.551 --> 08:06.954
* And miles...

08:06.987 --> 08:07.988
* Oh, yeah.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.273
All right, Krummy,
now that we got

08:26.306 --> 08:27.775
Alison's wearable
working again,

08:27.808 --> 08:28.676
how do we find the killer

08:28.709 --> 08:30.811
using just the data
off the fitness band?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.212
I'm still working
on that, Nelson.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.881
I am open to any
piece of brilliance

08:33.914 --> 08:35.683
you might like to offer.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.217
All right.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.086
(groans)

08:41.354 --> 08:42.756
(Nelson laughs)

08:42.790 --> 08:44.024
I give him one more day.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.993
Who, Barry?
Yeah.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.060
No, he's doing fine.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.629
Man, four days in and I haven't

08:48.662 --> 08:49.630
seen him successfully recover

08:49.663 --> 08:50.631
any evidence

08:50.664 --> 08:52.666
on one cell phone yet.
I'll bet you he quits.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.767
First week's hard for everybody.

08:53.801 --> 08:54.902
You had to adjust, too,
you know.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.169
(clicks tongue)
Please.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.639
I knew how to extract data off
a broken phone since day one.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.173
And I could do that
with my eyes closed.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.274
(snorts)

09:01.308 --> 09:02.275
(laughing):
Okay.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.343
Oh, really?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.845
Okay, I see how it is, Krummy.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.346
If you really believe
that Barry's gonna make it

09:06.379 --> 09:08.281
through the week,
let's make it interesting.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.650
No.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.651
I don't feel

09:10.684 --> 09:12.820
comfortable gambling
on the fate

09:12.853 --> 09:13.887
of our subordinates.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.689
Not even if the loser has to do

09:15.723 --> 09:16.489
all the processing paperwork

09:16.523 --> 09:18.792
for our entire
backlog of cases?

09:19.993 --> 09:20.961
Well, I feel comfortable
with that.

09:20.994 --> 09:21.962
All right.
All right.

09:21.995 --> 09:22.963
It's a bet.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.231
(Krumitz chuckles)

09:24.264 --> 09:25.198
Barry's coming through.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.366
I doubt it.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.068
That handsome man...
He's nervous.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.770
Hey, able to
find anything?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.973
We know that Alison was a very
heavy fitness wearable user,

09:33.006 --> 09:34.241
and I mean heavy.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.876
She wore that thing
all the time.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.877
RUSSELL:
Wow, look at that.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.847
So, that thing recorded
her sleeping patterns,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.683
workout schedule, eating habits.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.652
Even stored medical stats.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.585
That's amazing.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.254
Her whole life,
right there on her wrist.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.922
Three-axis gyroscope
that logs movement

09:48.956 --> 09:49.957
data in real time.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.826
That's acceleration, speed,
and direction.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.796
Meaning we can tell when
Alison was walking, running,

09:55.829 --> 09:58.398
or driving a car, right?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.934
Yup, that, too, I mean,
this is everything that happened

10:00.968 --> 10:02.102
on the night
of Alison's abduction.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.271
At 8:29 p.m.
Alison loaded a playlist

10:04.304 --> 10:05.873
and set her running goal
to four miles.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.274
Then, at 8:32 p.m.,

10:07.307 --> 10:08.275
she started jogging.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.910
And at 8:57 p.m.,

10:09.943 --> 10:11.378
something happened that

10:11.411 --> 10:13.747
made her heart rate spike
and her pace quicken.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.282
Well, when you run your pace
should quicken first,

10:15.315 --> 10:16.283
then your heart rate goes up.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.718
But...

10:17.751 --> 10:18.852
that's not what happened
in this case.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.087
Both heart rate and pace

10:20.120 --> 10:21.354
increased at
the exact same time.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.289
Why?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.824
Something or somebody
scared her, right?

10:23.857 --> 10:24.792
Well, she was sprinting hard

10:24.825 --> 10:26.694
for almost a minute
before something caused

10:26.727 --> 10:28.962
her heart rate to drop
at 8:58 p.m.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.431
What's going on here

10:31.464 --> 10:33.867
after the unknown event at 8:58?

10:33.901 --> 10:35.302
The wearable's
still logging data,

10:35.335 --> 10:36.837
but it's all over the place.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.872
The wearable's accelerometer
and the gyroscope

10:38.906 --> 10:40.407
were completely out of whack.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.076
Because the wristband was
damaged, it went haywire.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.012
That's why the data is skewed.

10:45.045 --> 10:48.782
It's skewed, but it's
internally consistent, right?

10:48.816 --> 10:50.851
World War II,
Germany, uh...

10:50.884 --> 10:52.319
the encryption device...

10:52.352 --> 10:53.320
Enigma machine.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.321
Right.
Yeah.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.023
Nazis wanted to keep info
on troop movements

10:56.056 --> 10:57.024
secret from the Allies.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.926
Mm-hmm, right up
until my man

10:58.959 --> 11:01.194
Alan Turing invented
the Bombe. That's right.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.731
The first computer ever
built, and he used it

11:03.764 --> 11:05.232
to crack the Nazis'
cipher, by pulling

11:05.265 --> 11:07.334
a commonly used phrase,
"Heil Hitler,"

11:07.367 --> 11:09.202
from Enigma's daily messages.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.904
Turing was able
to build a baseline

11:10.938 --> 11:12.272
that broke Enigma's encryption.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.974
(Russell laughs)

11:14.007 --> 11:15.108
What?
A brother can't binge-watch

11:15.142 --> 11:16.376
a little History Channel
at night?

11:16.409 --> 11:19.079
I just figured you were the guy
who was always playing Halo

11:19.112 --> 11:20.313
during his time off.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.950
So, wait a minute, we're-we're
on to something here, right?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.351
To unskew this

11:24.384 --> 11:26.086
jumbled data,

11:26.119 --> 11:28.956
we need to create a
baseline of known, good

11:28.989 --> 11:31.158
wearable data to compare

11:31.191 --> 11:33.493
to the skewed data
of Alison's band.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.963
Which will allow us to decrypt
the jumbled fitness data

11:35.996 --> 11:37.497
and figure out the rest
of Alison's night.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.868
Okay, D.B., I'm walking.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.102
Both wearables
transferring data?

11:42.135 --> 11:44.371
Yup, just keep walking straight.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.773
You're wobbling a little bit.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.107
I'm not wobbling.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.108
Yeah, a little bit.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.844
Um, guys...

11:50.878 --> 11:51.879
(laughs)

11:51.912 --> 11:53.280
What is happening here?

11:53.313 --> 11:56.383
We are calibrating data
from Alison's fitness band

11:56.416 --> 11:59.386
and the, uh, brand-new
one over there.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.921
Hopefully we'll get
a baseline to figure out

12:00.954 --> 12:01.721
what happened to her.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.256
That's good.
All right, you're good.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.524
Come on back.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.425
Let's take a crack

12:05.458 --> 12:08.762
at our own version
of the Enigma code.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.263
Okeydokey.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.431
Here we go.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.268
Okay.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.304
(Russell chuckles)

12:17.337 --> 12:20.540
All right, are you
responsible for this,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.543
Avery Ryan?
(Ryan laughs)

12:23.576 --> 12:25.245
Oh, look how cute he is.
What is he doing?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.147
Is he moping around?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.216
Just like the Cal Bear
fans will be doing

12:29.249 --> 12:32.352
after the Hoyas mop
the floor with them.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.421
Yes, you are very funny.
(Ryan laughs)

12:34.454 --> 12:36.456
What's the new password, please?

12:36.489 --> 12:38.058
(clears throat)
Unbearable.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.027
(both laugh)

12:40.060 --> 12:41.494
Why, I ought to...

12:41.528 --> 12:45.098
All right, so the green points
are what Alison's damaged

12:45.132 --> 12:47.434
fitness band recorded
while Danny was walking

12:47.467 --> 12:48.468
down the hallway,

12:48.501 --> 12:49.469
and the red points

12:49.502 --> 12:51.438
are the new fitness band,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.240
what it recorded.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.441
How long will it
take you to use

12:54.474 --> 12:56.076
the good data to
decode the bad?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.846
Well, considering
the gyroscope and accelerometer

12:58.879 --> 13:00.313
were both busted,
it's gonna be

13:00.347 --> 13:01.314
a little bit more complicated

13:01.348 --> 13:04.151
than simply figuring out
that the letters "ABC"

13:04.184 --> 13:05.585
actually mean "XYZ."

13:05.618 --> 13:08.822
Right, but the-the inner clock
had no movable parts,

13:08.856 --> 13:10.924
so it should still be
functioning properly.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.193
RYAN: So, even though
Alison's data

13:13.226 --> 13:14.327
on her fitness band
is incorrect,

13:14.361 --> 13:17.564
we can still say with certainty
that she was attacked,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.066
murdered,
and her body was dumped

13:19.099 --> 13:20.433
before 11:38 p.m.?

13:20.467 --> 13:23.203
Yeah, uh, after 11:38 p.m.,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.205
it looks like Alison
stopped moving altogether.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.607
Probably when her body
was dumped in the field.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.042
RUSSELL:
Which means...

13:29.076 --> 13:31.078
that everything
that happened to Alison

13:31.111 --> 13:32.545
after she was abducted,

13:32.579 --> 13:37.484
happened during the three hours
her husband's cell was off.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.585
NELSON:
Hey, Avery, check this out.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.889
Router logs came back
with something interesting.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.490
And, now, according
to the Internet activity

13:43.523 --> 13:45.392
in the Resnick's house,
someone came home

13:45.425 --> 13:47.895
after Alison was murdered.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.362
Data look like
it was the husband.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.099
Well, that goes against
the statement that Dylan gave

13:52.132 --> 13:53.500
to the local police.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.035
Raven may be right after all.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.071
Dylan Resnick may be
our murderer.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.539
We're going to South Carolina.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.916
DYLAN: I don't know
how many times

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
I can say it,
I didn't kill my wife.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.252
Why'd you lie
to the police?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.587
In your official
statement,

14:14.621 --> 14:15.655
you told them you spent

14:15.688 --> 14:17.290
the whole night
searching for her.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.259
Because that's what I did.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.628
RUSSELL:
Except you didn't, Dylan.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.131
We imaged your home router,

14:24.164 --> 14:27.667
took a little peek
at your activity log.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.502
Does not support your story,

14:29.536 --> 14:32.139
and, activity logs,
unlike people, do not lie.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.442
You see, what routers
do is they keep a log

14:35.475 --> 14:38.145
of all the Wi-Fi devices
that connect to them.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.948
It's like an on, off
switch, so, right here...

14:41.982 --> 14:45.018
is the activity
in your home

14:45.052 --> 14:46.920
during the night
your wife was murdered.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.155
The police report
states that

14:48.188 --> 14:49.689
your neighbors heard
you and Alison

14:49.722 --> 14:51.658
fighting at 8:00 p.m.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.626
At 8:34, she went for a jog.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.630
At which point,
you shut off your cell phone,

14:57.664 --> 14:59.933
which disconnected
from your home router.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.401
I didn't turn my phone off.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.402
The battery died.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.571
I couldn't
even call Ali.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.974
And I didn't charge it
until I got back,

15:07.007 --> 15:08.641
after I got back
from looking for her.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.511
Why don't you just tell us
what you did do

15:11.544 --> 15:13.313
while your cell was off?

15:13.346 --> 15:16.316
Ali and I fight sometimes,

15:16.349 --> 15:18.451
and she goes for a jog
to clear her head,

15:18.485 --> 15:21.188
but something was
different that night.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.591
And so after I didn't
find her on her route,

15:24.624 --> 15:27.060
I went looking
in the woods on foot.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.328
You're lying, Dylan.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.064
The shoes you're
wearing right now...

15:31.098 --> 15:33.066
the same shoes you were wearing

15:33.100 --> 15:35.202
the night your wife
was murdered,

15:35.235 --> 15:40.740
they come with a built-in smart
chip that logs your data,

15:40.773 --> 15:43.476
including your
step count activity.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.047
RUSSELL: You came home
and plugged in your cell

15:47.080 --> 15:47.947
to recharge it, right?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.649
Well, the built-in chip
in your shoe

15:49.682 --> 15:52.385
paired with your phone
over the Bluetooth,

15:52.419 --> 15:55.288
and then pushed data
to the app on your cell.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.324
When we analyzed
your cell,

15:57.357 --> 15:59.259
the step log tell us you
weren't exactly running around

15:59.292 --> 16:00.227
in the woods all night long.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.162
As a matter of fact,
there was an hour here

16:02.195 --> 16:04.497
where you barely walked at all.

16:04.531 --> 16:08.335
Between 9:47 and 10:49

16:08.368 --> 16:12.005
you were idle, so...

16:12.039 --> 16:16.009
let's cut the crap, please.

16:16.043 --> 16:19.512
Dylan, tell us where you were
and what you were doing.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.051
I went to see someone.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.321
My ex-girlfriend.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.522
We're just friends.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.191
I'm not having an affair.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.261
Sometimes I just need someone
who will listen, and...

16:34.294 --> 16:37.797
I've been turning to Maya
for relationship advice.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.600
Now, if I mentioned
that to the cops,

16:40.633 --> 16:42.202
how does that make me look?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.536
Guilty.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.339
I didn't kill my wife,
I swear to you.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.608
I didn't kill my wife.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.343
I loved Ali.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.415
I've always loved her.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.285
I wouldn't hurt her.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.422
(panting)

17:14.167 --> 17:16.736
(shouts, groaning)

17:17.870 --> 17:20.407
(grunting):
Aah, my leg, it's...

17:20.440 --> 17:22.109
it's broken.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.843
Please know,
I didn't want this, okay?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.378
I have no choice.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.314
I'm sorry.
(groaning)

17:31.251 --> 17:32.719
I'm sorry.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.788
I'm sorry.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.824
(man grunting)

17:40.893 --> 17:43.096
I'm sorry.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.801
Finally decrypted
all the jumbled data

17:51.204 --> 17:52.139
RAMIREZ: Why are those pins
different colors?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.408
It's a movement log
of Alison's evening.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.544
The yellow speed graph
shows when and where

17:57.577 --> 17:59.879
she stopped jogging,
and where she was transported

17:59.912 --> 18:02.249
in a car for the first time.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.783
NELSON:
And the red speed graph

18:03.816 --> 18:04.884
leads to that GPS location.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.519
She was there for five days

18:06.553 --> 18:08.188
before the highway patrol
found her body.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.290
RAMIREZ: Yeah,
but the first red pin drop,

18:10.323 --> 18:12.592
that's the area where
Alison's heart stopped beating,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.194
and where she died.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.763
Yeah, Alison was at that
location for 94 minutes

18:16.796 --> 18:19.266
before her fitness band shows
her body was moved again.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.901
94 minutes gives you enough time
to kill her and dump her body.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.771
Sending GPS coordinates
to Elijah.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.399
Clear.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.433
AGENT:
Clear.

18:56.969 --> 18:57.937
(sighs)

18:57.970 --> 18:59.172
We got a body.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.873
(steady beeping)

19:17.724 --> 19:20.293
(gasping)

19:20.327 --> 19:21.494
Call EMS.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.529
(gasping)

19:29.836 --> 19:31.938
RUSSELL: Can you tell me
what you remember, Ron?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.706
RON: I was on the last mile
of my run.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.608
A car came out of nowhere.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.577
I didn't even feel
the impact.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.978
I just remember flying
through the air.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.881
Were you able to take a look
at the car or the driver?

19:41.914 --> 19:43.550
No.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.418
I did hear a voice.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.387
I think it was the guy
who hit me.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.621
He was apologizing.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.523
Just please know,
I didn't want this, okay?

19:50.557 --> 19:51.858
I have no choice.

19:51.891 --> 19:52.925
I'm sorry.

19:52.959 --> 19:53.960
(groaning)

19:53.993 --> 19:55.828
That's all I remember.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.896
Then I woke up here.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.865
Okay, hey, fellas...

19:58.898 --> 20:00.933
these gentlemen
are gonna get you

20:00.967 --> 20:02.535
to a hospital.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.403
Thank you.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.508
MUNDO:
Unlike Alison's fitness band,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.277
Ron's was still intact.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.746
I imaged it
and sent it back to CTOC.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.015
All right, so Ron said

20:16.048 --> 20:18.385
he was hit by a car
before he was abducted.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.352
The coroner found

20:19.386 --> 20:20.387
the same bruising

20:20.420 --> 20:22.722
on Alison's legs
and her lower back.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.957
Which means they were
both hit by cars.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.926
RUSSELL: That would also
explain the spike

20:26.959 --> 20:28.628
on her wearable data

20:28.661 --> 20:29.996
at 8:58 p.m.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.898
(groaning)

20:31.931 --> 20:33.333
Vehicular blitzing.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.901
It's a tactic used
by pedophiles.

20:34.934 --> 20:35.835
They hit a kid,

20:35.868 --> 20:37.837
helps incapacitate them
before abduction.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.372
RUSSELL:
So, our target is using

20:39.406 --> 20:40.773
these fitness wearables

20:40.807 --> 20:42.942
to profile,

20:42.975 --> 20:44.477
and then stalk
and kidnap people

20:44.511 --> 20:45.778
in top physical shape, right?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.582
That's surgical tools,
a cooler,

20:49.616 --> 20:51.318
blood bags,

20:51.351 --> 20:54.287
anesthetic machine,
heart rate monitor.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.022
Ice in the cooler
is still frozen.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.657
We must have scared
our target away.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.727
RYAN: Well, we're either dealing
with a modern day

21:00.760 --> 21:03.363
Victor Frankenstein,
or this is organ harvesting.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.764
RUSSELL:
If that's the case,

21:04.797 --> 21:07.967
then why did he leave all
of Alison's organs behind?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.869
She must have died
before he could operate.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.003
You know, there are
plenty of organs

21:11.037 --> 21:12.004
that are still viable

21:12.038 --> 21:13.873
in a body post-mortem,

21:13.906 --> 21:14.874
so maybe they were
too damaged

21:14.907 --> 21:17.444
from the impact of the car.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.745
So, what are we
saying here?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.648
That our organ harvester
is being selective

21:21.681 --> 21:23.650
about the organs
he's chopping out to sell?

21:23.683 --> 21:25.352
Our target is hunting.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.289
(tires screeching)

21:33.426 --> 21:35.395
I had to leave our donor.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.496
What the hell happened?

21:36.529 --> 21:37.497
The Feds busted in.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.565
The O.R.'s burnt.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.566
They're on to us.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.933
We-we have to stop this.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.369
No, no.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.436
Bring me the next person.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.437
No, no, Richard,

21:44.471 --> 21:45.938
this is getting out of hand.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.440
This isn't what we agreed...

21:47.474 --> 21:48.775
We don't have a choice, Keith.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.976
We're running out of time.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.078
We have to do this.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.347
We need to do this.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.348
Find me someone new.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.549
Bring them to me.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.784
(panting)

21:57.817 --> 21:58.951
(engine starts)

21:58.985 --> 22:00.987
(tires screeching)

22:02.855 --> 22:04.090
All right, where are you
with Ron's wearable?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.091
Moments away

22:05.124 --> 22:06.593
from pinpointing
the exact moment

22:06.626 --> 22:07.860
it was infected with malware.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.731
Judgment day.

22:11.764 --> 22:12.965
How you feeling?

22:12.999 --> 22:14.367
KRUMITZ:
Confident.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.735
Barry's gonna come
through for me.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.837
Once you bring
that first phone

22:17.870 --> 22:18.805
back to life it's addicting,

22:18.838 --> 22:20.707
like resurrecting a body
back from the dead.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.709
I think you need to clear your
social calendar tonight, Krummy,

22:22.742 --> 22:25.412
because, uh, you're
about to have a hot date

22:25.445 --> 22:26.879
with a mountain of paperwork.

22:26.913 --> 22:27.947
Hey, look at this.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.382
Yeah.

22:29.416 --> 22:32.952
The malware was dropped
onto Ron's wearable

22:32.985 --> 22:35.555
two weeks ago using an NFC,
like Bluetooth.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.889
So, that means
the black hat had to be

22:36.923 --> 22:37.590
within 100 feet.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.459
Where was Ron at two weeks ago?

22:39.492 --> 22:43.162
The corner of 5th and Washington
in Rockland, South Carolina.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.664
He was running a 10k race.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.866
So was Alison Resnick.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.468
The target used the race
as a hunting ground.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.669
Yeah.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.070
He could have waited along

22:51.103 --> 22:52.705
the race route
and forced malware

22:52.739 --> 22:53.873
on any fitness band
that went past.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.743
NELSON:
And anybody with a wearable

22:56.776 --> 22:57.777
could have been
his next victim.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.446
Our target's hitting people
with cars, right?

22:59.479 --> 23:00.447
Correct.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.247
Means the wearable would show
an odd sequence

23:01.280 --> 23:02.515
of metrics
at the moment of impact.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.151
Both Alison and Ron Bechtel's
heart rates increased rapidly

23:05.184 --> 23:07.687
when they realized that
they were being chased, huh.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.422
Then, boom.
The vehicles hit them,

23:09.456 --> 23:10.457
and they're transported
in the car.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.491
This anomaly...

23:11.524 --> 23:12.625
It's the same for both.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.626
NELSON:
It's like finding the same

23:13.660 --> 23:15.695
fingerprint at two crime scenes.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.729
I'll put a flag
on the fitness network.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.765
If we get another anomaly
like our first two,

23:18.798 --> 23:20.600
it'll send us
an immediate alert.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.471
RYAN: All right,
something about this

23:24.504 --> 23:25.304
isn't adding up.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.873
Organ harvesting
is a huge business.

23:26.906 --> 23:27.874
There are sites

23:27.907 --> 23:29.041
on the Deep Web that bring in

23:29.075 --> 23:30.142
millions of dollars every year.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.043
Supposedly,

23:31.077 --> 23:32.679
over 100,000 people
in the U.S. alone

23:32.712 --> 23:34.647
are legally waiting
for an organ,

23:34.681 --> 23:35.915
so some of them
must get desperate

23:35.948 --> 23:37.750
and go on the
Deep Web's Red Market

23:37.784 --> 23:39.051
looking for a miracle.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.654
The classic supply doesn't
meet demand scenario.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.590
But our target isn't
trying to meet demand.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.058
He's very specific
about choosing his victims.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.827
Yeah, he's only
going after people

23:47.860 --> 23:49.862
in the best
physical shape.

23:49.896 --> 23:52.164
It's not about quantity,
it's about quality.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.200
But organ harvesters
don't care about quality.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.968
In the Deep Web,
an organ is an organ.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.137
They just find one and sell
it to the highest bidder.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.171
RYAN:
But that isn't what

23:59.205 --> 24:00.206
our target's doing.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.508
All right,

24:01.541 --> 24:03.510
so both of our victims,
Ron and Alison,

24:03.543 --> 24:04.977
they had the same
blood type, right?

24:05.011 --> 24:06.245
Right, B positive.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.279
Both of them.

24:07.313 --> 24:10.049
Organ harvesters don't care
about blood types.

24:10.082 --> 24:13.019
They only care about getting
as many organs as they can,

24:13.052 --> 24:15.154
from as many people as they can.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.556
It's weird, it's like
it's not a business,

24:16.589 --> 24:17.557
it's personal.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.891
No, I agree.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.927
Yeah?

24:23.663 --> 24:24.764
Send us the coordinates.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.266
Krumitz just got a hit
on the fitness band database.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.569
Our target's taken
another victim, Karen Carter.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.738
MUNDO All right, I got the
wearable's GPS coordinates.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.640
We can track Karen.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.141
They're on the move.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.881
(sirens wailing)

24:44.684 --> 24:47.119
(tires screeching)

24:47.153 --> 24:48.187
AGENT:
FBI!

24:50.823 --> 24:51.824
Freeze!
Stay right there.

24:51.858 --> 24:52.892
Stay right
where you are.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.627
Slowly, turn off the ignition.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.028
Throw the keys outside the car.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.267
Where is she?

25:01.300 --> 25:02.669
(indistinct radio transmissions)

25:02.702 --> 25:04.136
Karen Carter, where is she?

25:04.170 --> 25:05.838
Who?

25:05.872 --> 25:06.973
Hands on the wheel.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.185
The tarp.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.553
Remove it.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.609
(sighs)

25:42.642 --> 25:44.644
Avery, the target knows
we're tracking his exploit,

25:44.677 --> 25:46.646
sent us on a wild goose chase.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.180
Karen Carter could be on
an operating table right now.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.215
We're running out of time.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.021
Please.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.056
I was just married.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.057
My husband...

25:58.090 --> 25:59.158
he has money.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.927
We can pay you
whatever you want.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.762
Shh...

26:02.795 --> 26:04.330
Money's not gonna save my wife.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.965
(whimpering)

26:05.998 --> 26:08.067
I'm sorry, Karen,

26:08.100 --> 26:10.302
but I need you.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.672
(crying)

26:12.705 --> 26:13.706
Shh...

26:20.112 --> 26:22.381
KEITH:
We shouldn't do this.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.282
We shouldn't do
this, I mean,

26:23.315 --> 26:25.217
m-maybe the network
will come through.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.319
RICHARD:
If there was any possibility,

26:27.353 --> 26:29.288
any possibility that
that phone would ring,

26:29.321 --> 26:32.291
I would stop right now,

26:32.324 --> 26:35.995
but we both know that's
not gonna happen.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.164
I don't want more blood
on my hands.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.868
I can't do this alone, Keith.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.938
I need to know
that you're on board.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.941
The only thing that matters
now is Sarah.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.811
(woman coughing)

26:53.379 --> 26:54.681
Hey.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.682
Keith.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.416
Hi, beautiful.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.953
Hi, I'm sorry we-we didn't
mean to wake you.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.321
You need to rest.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.223
What are you boys
fighting about?

27:08.728 --> 27:10.229
(sighs)

27:10.262 --> 27:12.765
(whispering):
Nothing.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.366
Nothing.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.369
You're a terrible liar,
you know that?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.005
(chuckles)

27:21.874 --> 27:23.275
I know what you're up to.

27:26.779 --> 27:30.016
You called in some favors
to get me higher on the list.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.021
And I appreciate it, but...

27:37.489 --> 27:38.991
...it's enough.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.059
No.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.060
Yeah.

27:41.093 --> 27:41.994
No, it's not.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.997
Enough of all
the hushed conversations.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.434
Enough of everybody
worrying all the time.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.438
Dad.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.779
(sighs)

28:08.287 --> 28:10.056
I'm tired.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.894
I lost your mother to this.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.495
Honey, I...

28:16.528 --> 28:19.198
I'm not gonna lose you, too.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.433
Daddy...

28:23.535 --> 28:25.004
let me go.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.080
(sighs)

28:37.817 --> 28:41.220
Just... just relax, baby.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.254
Just sleep.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.266
All right, thanks, bud.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.501
Where are we at
with Karen's wearable?

28:55.534 --> 28:56.502
Krumitz says that

28:56.535 --> 28:57.804
the fitness band malware

28:57.837 --> 28:58.971
is a custom script,

28:59.005 --> 29:00.206
definitely domestic in origin,

29:00.239 --> 29:01.507
but otherwise a big,
fat dead end.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.944
I just sent images of our third
victim's devices back to CTOC.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.445
Okay, we've got the full image

29:06.478 --> 29:08.480
of our third victim's
fitness band and cell phone.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.084
KRUMITZ:
There it is.

29:12.118 --> 29:12.919
The same anomaly

29:12.952 --> 29:14.987
we saw on Alison
and Ron's wearables.

29:15.021 --> 29:15.988
Tells us Karen was hit by

29:16.022 --> 29:18.858
our target's car
at 2:35 p.m.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.492
Okay, I'm gonna cross-reference
that timestamp

29:20.526 --> 29:22.161
with the wearable's GPS map.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.196
All right.

29:25.832 --> 29:26.966
Karen was abducted on the corner

29:26.999 --> 29:28.500
of Chester Avenue
and Ashford Street.

29:28.534 --> 29:32.204
RYAN: Well, our first two
victims were taken at night,

29:32.238 --> 29:35.274
and our last victim was taken
in broad daylight.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.542
So, our target's
taking risks.

29:36.575 --> 29:37.543
They're changing
their plan.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.812
They're on a clock.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.447
The organ's intended recipient

29:41.480 --> 29:43.215
could be nearing death.

29:43.249 --> 29:46.118
Which means they've been sick
for a very long time.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.519
They could have gone
through legitimate channels,

29:47.553 --> 29:48.855
trying to get an organ,

29:48.888 --> 29:50.522
and finally given up hope.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.557
If you need an organ,
first step

29:51.590 --> 29:53.525
is to register with NORD,

29:53.559 --> 29:55.261
National Organ
Recipient Database.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.997
Our sick person
might be on the NORD list.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.565
NELSON: Anything on
Karen Carter's cell phone?

29:59.598 --> 30:00.566
KRUMITZ:
A bunch of apps,

30:00.599 --> 30:01.868
nothing exciting,

30:01.901 --> 30:05.371
just calendar, e-mail, text...

30:05.404 --> 30:08.374
Wait, wait, she's got a jogging
app that's still running.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.543
Okay, this jogging app
connects over Bluetooth to chips

30:11.577 --> 30:13.880
built into user's sneakers,
means Karen was wearing

30:13.913 --> 30:15.014
chipped running shoes
when she was abducted.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.015
Now, can we track them?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.049
Unfortunately, no,

30:17.083 --> 30:19.218
smart sneakers don't have GPS.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.286
The only way they
can dump the data

30:20.319 --> 30:21.253
is to be paired
with her phone,

30:21.287 --> 30:23.422
but that would have
to be near the sneakers,

30:23.455 --> 30:24.891
and not in FBI custody.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.926
(thumps)

30:28.127 --> 30:30.997
MAN:
Hey, Barry, you did it.

30:31.030 --> 30:31.998
All right, Barry.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.566
Way to go.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.869
Really?

30:36.903 --> 30:38.905
All right, that was
the network admin at NORD.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.439
Get this, about a month ago,

30:40.472 --> 30:42.041
their intrusion detection system

30:42.074 --> 30:43.175
flagged an attempted hack.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.310
Someone tried to move

30:44.343 --> 30:45.444
a loved one's name
up the list?

30:45.477 --> 30:47.013
Yes and no.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.480
Turns out there's
no actual waiting list.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.616
It's an algorithm that pairs
donors with recipients

30:50.649 --> 30:55.087
based on body size, blood type
and geographic location.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.356
You said attempted hack,
they weren't successful?

30:57.389 --> 30:59.591
Booted off the system
before they could do any damage.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.927
Used a spoof I.P. address.

31:00.960 --> 31:01.928
Totally anonymous.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.429
Not totally anonymous.

31:03.462 --> 31:06.665
I'm guessing that our hacker
is Alison's killer.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.336
So, plan A was to rig
this NORD algorithm.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.638
When that didn't work,
it escalated to abduction.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.474
Any digital dust left
in the network hack?

31:15.507 --> 31:16.575
No, but...

31:16.608 --> 31:18.277
based on the algorithm,
I can tell you

31:18.310 --> 31:20.947
which part of it the hacker
was trying to adjust.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.283
Our target is shopping
for a kidney.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.224
Okay, that is a list
of 120,000 people

31:32.258 --> 31:35.394
from the National Organ
Recipient Database,

31:35.427 --> 31:37.563
and the almighty Krumitz

31:37.596 --> 31:39.431
is about to whittle
it down to just one.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.633
Excuse me, Almighty? (scoffs)

31:41.667 --> 31:43.469
Elijah said a new person
is added to the list

31:43.502 --> 31:44.470
every 12 minutes,

31:44.503 --> 31:45.938
so move along.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.040
Well, we know our person
needs a kidney,

31:48.074 --> 31:49.175
so that cuts our pool

31:49.208 --> 31:51.277
down to...

31:51.310 --> 31:52.511
104,000.

31:52.544 --> 31:53.946
RAMIREZ:
Well, we know more than just

31:53.980 --> 31:54.981
the organ they're after.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.248
We know that the blood type

31:56.282 --> 31:57.549
of the recipient is B positive.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.684
And the state they live in.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.419
Narrowing down by blood type

32:00.452 --> 32:03.189
and all states
surrounding South Carolina,

32:03.222 --> 32:05.491
gets us down to...

32:05.524 --> 32:06.959
over 3,000 people.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.227
All right,
Avery said the person

32:08.260 --> 32:09.495
we're looking for is desperate.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.298
That means they would have been
waiting a long time for a donor.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.499
Let's sort by duration.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.003
Here's a list
of 800 people

32:17.036 --> 32:19.005
who've been on the list
longer than five years.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.272
It has to be one of them.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.573
All right, guys, look at this.

32:21.607 --> 32:22.674
20 people have been flagged

32:22.708 --> 32:23.742
ineligible for a transplant.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.977
Let's focus on those.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.145
Wait, wait, no,
we don't have 20.

32:26.178 --> 32:30.149
17 of these people
are recently deceased.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.317
Okay, three people.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.185
We need something, anything,

32:33.219 --> 32:35.421
that proves they're related
to the abductions, okay?

32:35.454 --> 32:37.156
Let's start with
their FriendAgenda pages.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.125
Guys,
look at this post.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.159
Sarah Walker,

32:40.192 --> 32:41.160
diagnosed with

32:41.193 --> 32:42.428
Polycystic Kidney Disease.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.562
Husband, programmer,

32:43.595 --> 32:44.596
but her father...

32:44.630 --> 32:46.332
is a retired surgeon.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.671
You're gonna be okay.

32:52.704 --> 32:53.705
Do you hear me?

32:53.739 --> 32:56.375
It's gonna be okay.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.310
You're gonna get through this,
I promise you.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.016
I love you.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.620
Are you ready?

33:16.795 --> 33:18.197
Yeah, I think so.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.132
Keith, when I open her up,

33:20.166 --> 33:21.533
I need to know

33:21.567 --> 33:23.069
you can do this.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.239
When I tell you,

33:27.273 --> 33:28.274
I want you to put
some pressure on her abdomen.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.190
What do you got, Krumitz?

33:44.223 --> 33:45.691
Okay, we believe our target
is Keith Walker,

33:45.724 --> 33:47.193
Sarah's husband
and a former programmer

33:47.226 --> 33:48.827
at Tech Line Industries.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.562
Yeah, we're guessing that
the surgeon is her dad,

33:50.596 --> 33:51.363
Dr. Richard Margolin.

33:51.397 --> 33:52.831
About three years
ago he retired

33:52.864 --> 33:53.899
to take care
of his ailing wife.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.534
A couple months later,
she died of complications

33:55.567 --> 33:56.835
from Polycystic Kidney Disease.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.738
Same genetic disease
that's killing his daughter.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.573
We need to find Karen Carter

34:01.607 --> 34:04.243
before they harvest her kidney
and possibly kill her.

34:04.276 --> 34:05.577
Do we have any idea
where these people are?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.479
No, the phones are off.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.081
Uh, no social
media activity.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.382
Local PD checked
their homes.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.317
No sign of them.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.519
Last time they popped up
was five days ago

34:13.552 --> 34:15.587
when Sarah's father checked
her out of the hospital,

34:15.621 --> 34:16.855
against medical advice.

34:16.888 --> 34:17.823
Let's think this through.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.258
They lost the operating room

34:19.291 --> 34:20.392
that they'd setup.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.428
So, they got to be
looking for another one.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.496
Well, they could be
at any hospital or clinic

34:24.530 --> 34:25.664
in a hundred-mile radius.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.134
We need to narrow down
the search.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.668
Okay, how?

34:29.701 --> 34:31.737
(sighs)
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.173
Everyone in the NORD system
is given a cell phone.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.807
They're instructed to keep it
on them at all times.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.209
It's how NORD alerts them

34:37.243 --> 34:38.610
immediately if an organ
becomes available.

34:38.644 --> 34:39.845
But Sarah is still
in the system.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.547
That was Sarah's lifeline
for three years.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.115
She took it with her everywhere.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.850
There's a good chance
she's got it with her right now.

34:44.883 --> 34:46.285
All right, got the number
for Sarah's NORD phone

34:46.318 --> 34:47.486
from their data bank.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.455
It's active,
location services are on.

34:49.488 --> 34:50.556
I've got a location.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.758
We need to make sure
that they're at that location.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.426
They sent us
on a wild goose chase

34:54.460 --> 34:55.861
with Karen's phone earlier.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.429
We don't have time
to be wrong again.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.231
KRUMITZ: What if we track
our last victim,

34:59.265 --> 35:00.232
Karen Carter,

35:00.266 --> 35:01.167
by her running shoes?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.168
Krumitz,
that's brilliant.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.835
Guys, want to fill
us in, please?

35:03.869 --> 35:06.305
Karen Carter
was wearing Bluetooth enabled

35:06.338 --> 35:09.241
running shoes
when she was abducted.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.577
Those shoes pair
with an app on her cell.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.645
Tracks step count.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.681
If we push Karen's sneaker app
to Sarah's NORD phone,

35:15.714 --> 35:17.383
maybe we can trick the phone

35:17.416 --> 35:18.384
into pairing
to Karen's shoes.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.385
It would immediately give us

35:19.418 --> 35:20.386
Karen's location.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.520
There's only one problem.

35:21.553 --> 35:22.688
What?

35:22.721 --> 35:24.756
We need to send it
to Sarah's phone.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.258
We'd have to embed the app

35:26.292 --> 35:28.527
in a text message
so we can send it to the phone.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.796
The chimes could
alert our targets.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.798
We have no choice.
Do it now.

35:40.872 --> 35:43.309
(phone dinging)

35:45.777 --> 35:47.779
(phone dinging)

35:51.483 --> 35:52.951
It worked.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.853
Nelson, you're right.
We got a location.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.722
Carolina Outpatient Clinic.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.493
(sirens wailing)

36:08.767 --> 36:09.835
AGENT:
Negative. All clear.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.407
FBI.

36:15.441 --> 36:16.408
Put your hands in the air.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.377
Do not say a word. Cuff him.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.648
FBI! Hands in the air, now.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.284
Slowly, step away
from the table.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.486
Turn around.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.520
Drop the knife.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.591
You're too late.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.227
It's done.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.463
(steady beeping)

36:38.630 --> 36:40.232
AGENT:
Clear.

36:40.266 --> 36:42.668
Keep going, keep going.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.374
Okay, now the whole floor's
blocked off.

36:49.875 --> 36:50.842
They're alive! Both of them!

36:50.876 --> 36:52.378
Get the paramedics in here now!

36:55.914 --> 36:56.848
KEITH:
Sarah!

36:56.882 --> 36:58.550
Sarah, baby, everything's
gonna be all right.

36:58.584 --> 36:59.551
You made it
through surgery.

36:59.585 --> 37:00.852
You just got to
hold on, okay?

37:00.886 --> 37:01.720
It's all right now.

37:01.753 --> 37:02.921
Hey, will you just
please let me know

37:02.954 --> 37:03.989
when she wakes up?

37:04.022 --> 37:06.024
Please! If you had a wife,
you would understand.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.526
I had no choice.

37:08.794 --> 37:09.761
Get him out of here.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.029
Sir, please!

37:11.062 --> 37:13.632
Sarah!

37:13.665 --> 37:16.468
Sarah!

37:16.502 --> 37:19.771
Karen, hi,
my name's D.B. Russell.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.408
I'm working with the FBI.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.643
You're safe now,
and you're gonna be all right.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.379
You're gonna have
a hard time believing

37:27.413 --> 37:28.680
what I'm about to tell you.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.985
Alison Resnick,
Ronald Bechtel, Karen Carter.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.521
Are there others out there

37:35.554 --> 37:36.788
that we don't know about?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.790
No, there's nobody else.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.026
I'm sure you think

37:41.059 --> 37:43.061
I'm some sort of monster...

37:43.094 --> 37:44.863
but I'm not.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.399
I'm just a father.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.535
A father whose little girl
is gonna live

37:49.568 --> 37:50.669
because of what we've done.

37:50.702 --> 37:51.703
That's true.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.474
But I wonder
how Sarah's gonna feel,

37:55.507 --> 37:57.576
knowing that her life
was paid for with murder.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.577
We never intended

37:58.610 --> 38:00.011
to kill Alison.

38:00.045 --> 38:01.447
That was an accident.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.316
Alison Resnick
was someone's daughter, too.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.986
It was worth it.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.627
Take him away.

38:27.739 --> 38:28.707
(humming)

38:28.740 --> 38:29.741
Seriously?

38:29.775 --> 38:30.976
It isn't enough to know

38:31.009 --> 38:31.877
that you won the bet,

38:31.910 --> 38:34.546
and that I have hours
of paperwork ahead.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.414
(chuckles)

38:35.447 --> 38:36.715
You really gonna stand
there and watch?

38:36.748 --> 38:38.917
I just wanted to take a moment

38:38.950 --> 38:41.653
and bask in the sweetness
of victory.

38:41.687 --> 38:42.721
(slurping)

38:42.754 --> 38:45.357
My main man Barry's here
to stay.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.992
Okay.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.395
That's for you.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.033
All right.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.368
Oh, my God.

38:56.402 --> 38:57.736
Let's hear it.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.539
I, Brody Nelson,

39:00.572 --> 39:03.475
on this day do solemnly admit,

39:03.509 --> 39:04.976
with clear eyes
and a full heart,

39:05.010 --> 39:07.846
that Daniel Krumitz was right.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.016
And?

39:13.018 --> 39:15.954
And... I was wrong.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.157
Why?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.126
Come on, man, bet's a bet.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.994
And that I should have known
better than to bet against

39:23.028 --> 39:26.698
The Almighty Krumitz and
his main man Barry because...

39:26.732 --> 39:27.699
(quickly):
Krummy don't play that.

39:27.733 --> 39:28.900
What?
No, I'm sorry, what?

39:28.934 --> 39:29.901
I can't hear you.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.438
Krummy don't play that.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.439
That's right, that's right.

39:33.472 --> 39:34.440
One more time.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.974
Man, I'm not doing it.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.809
Okay.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.445
All right.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.446
(laughing)

39:40.479 --> 39:42.481
Damn.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.986
Let's get to work.

39:49.588 --> 39:50.856
Okay.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.191
What is this thing?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.760
This thing doesn't
have a keyboard.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.028
REPORTER: Dylan Resnick is
finally a free man,

39:57.062 --> 39:58.029
after the recent

39:58.063 --> 39:59.097
capture of two suspects

39:59.130 --> 40:00.866
in the Alison Resnick

40:00.899 --> 40:01.867
murder case.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.570
Dylan Resnick's out of jail.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.937
Amen to that.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.939
He has been released,

40:07.973 --> 40:09.808
and reunited with his
mother-in-law, Elizabeth Turner.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.809
In other news...

40:10.842 --> 40:11.810
You know, sometimes

40:11.843 --> 40:14.179
humanity surprises me.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.881
How so?

40:15.914 --> 40:17.483
Karen, the girl
who lost her kidney...

40:18.617 --> 40:20.552
First thing she asked
after she realized

40:20.586 --> 40:21.720
that she was gonna be okay,

40:21.753 --> 40:23.689
was whether Sarah
was gonna make it.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.457
Hmm.
Cool, huh?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.594
Okay, here, hold this.

40:28.627 --> 40:29.595
What is this?

40:29.628 --> 40:30.462
I thought we missed the game.

40:30.496 --> 40:34.666
Yeah, well,
I had Nelson record it.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.002
(whooping) All right!

40:37.035 --> 40:38.169
(chuckles)

40:38.203 --> 40:41.940
Ah, after this match,
ooh, your Golden Bears

40:41.973 --> 40:43.742
are gonna get destroyed,
D.B. Russell.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.976
Yeah, in your dreams there,

40:45.010 --> 40:46.878
Deputy Director.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.114
Ah, all right,
this is more like it.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.516
(laughs)

40:51.983 --> 40:53.051
(Ryan whooping)
No, no, no!

40:54.620 --> 40:56.988
What is a Hoyas anyway?

40:57.022 --> 40:58.824
You know what,
I have no idea.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.492
Oh, no, no, no!

41:00.526 --> 41:01.527
(Ryan whooping)
