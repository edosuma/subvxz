Wow, that was a long flight.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.674
You know, if you're coming,
let's say from America,

01:31.758 --> 01:35.053
first, to get here, you've got
to get to Europe or the Middle East,

01:35.136 --> 01:38.348
change planes, however long
the layover is-- Mine was eight hours.

01:38.431 --> 01:44.562
And then another ten hours, at least,
to get to the southern tip of Africa.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.191
[Phil] Is it worth it? Take a look.

01:58.952 --> 02:05.291
It's almost as if they built a beautiful
city at the bottom of the Grand Canyon

02:05.375 --> 02:09.879
because the mountains have that kind of
striation you see with different colors.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.634
But I've never seen a city like this with
multiple mountains, incredible mountains,

02:15.093 --> 02:17.512
and the ocean coming
almost right up against it.

02:17.762 --> 02:23.685
It's really one of nature's crowning
achievements, this tip of Africa.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.032
[Phil] I'm just gonna jump right in
at Carne SA,

02:38.116 --> 02:40.660
which is famous for serving African game.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.122
Plus, the chef is Italian,
so I'm doubly excited.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.172
Tonight I get to dine
with Chef Giorgio Nava from Milan,

02:52.714 --> 02:56.551
and his girlfriend, Mala Bryan, a model
who moved to Cape Town from St. Lucia.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.429
How did you find yourself here,
both of you?

02:59.512 --> 03:00.763
The agency sent me here

03:00.847 --> 03:04.017
and I fell in love, like everybody else
falls in love with South Africa.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.896
I came here and I say it's time to open
a good Italian restaurant in Cape Town.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.441
There were many steak houses
all with the same cut, the same sauce.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.319
Were you the first great
Italian restaurant in Cape Town?

03:14.402 --> 03:17.197
-I can't say that. I was one of the first.
-I'll say it.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.074
-After I eat, I'll say it.
-[laughs]

03:20.158 --> 03:21.201
Yes, that's better.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.955
[Phil] Oh, look, here it comes.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.208
Three or four types of antelope...

03:28.750 --> 03:30.210
plus this is ostrich.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.961
Oh!

03:32.045 --> 03:34.422
[Phil] I like to call this
the lazy man's safari.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.550
I'm going in, starting with the ostrich.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.054
[Giorgio] Let me cut a bite of each.

03:41.596 --> 03:45.808
It's amazing that ostrich is a red meat.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.603
-[Giorgio] Yeah, it's like beef.
-[Phil] It's like beef.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.979
Wow.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.315
All right, I'm going to try kudu
for the first time.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.401
Which is the giant... thing
with the thing.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.404
[Phil] Kudu.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.451
Mm.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.705
It's just great meat. It's not gamey.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.416
These are so mild
and so sweet and so juicy.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.169
[Phil] Kudos to you kudu! Who knew?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.255
And then there's, uh, uh...

04:17.382 --> 04:19.217
Onyx or Ubyx or...

04:20.009 --> 04:21.678
What am I eating? What is that?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.054
This is Oryx.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.639
-[Phil] Oryx?
-[Giorgio] Oryx.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.640
[Phil] Not heard of it.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.978
But why aren't you cutting them though?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.188
Why do you not cut it in bite size?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.731
Because I'm an animal.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.733
[laughs]

04:35.817 --> 04:36.901
[Phil] A happy animal.

04:37.318 --> 04:41.072
-You're not eating your veggies though.
-She doesn't want to eat with me again.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.199
I don't cut my meat,
I don't eat my veggies.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.117
Mamma Mala.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.535
[laughs]

04:45.618 --> 04:50.290
I don't know what I like best. It's all
really... really good-- It's just great.

04:51.040 --> 04:51.874
What's this one?

04:51.958 --> 04:52.834
[Giorgio] Impala.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.044
-Impala is another antelope. Yes.
-Really?

04:55.503 --> 04:58.881
-I only know the car.
-Yeah, I know, of course, but...

04:59.507 --> 05:02.176
It goes with petrol.
This one goes with olive oil.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.559
-This is why you travel.
-Yes.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.643
To good meat!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.437
To good meat. Yeah. Thank you.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.782
[Phil] The best way
to find something great to eat

05:24.866 --> 05:27.952
whenever you go to a new place
is you ask one of the locals.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.165
So I ask Shaheen, our local
production assistant, what he recommends

05:32.248 --> 05:33.916
and he says you gotta get a Gatsby.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.462
So he takes me to the Golden Dish
in the Athlone neighborhood

05:37.545 --> 05:39.380
-so I can get me a Gatsby.
-Hi.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.631
Just one question...

05:40.715 --> 05:41.924
What is a Gatsby?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.218
[server] It's basically a long roll.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.764
You put chicken, sauce,
salads on there, sir.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.558
You should be hungry
if you're having one of these.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.311
There's chicken salad
and cheese and egg...

05:53.394 --> 05:56.356
And Lettuce and sauce
and another kind of sauce...

05:56.439 --> 05:57.482
and french fries...

05:58.775 --> 05:59.650
on the sandwich.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.945
Yes. Yes, delicious french fries,

06:03.029 --> 06:06.532
not like soggy, junky french fries.
Delicious french fries.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.868
You could just get a basket of those
and be happy.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.748
Yes, it's named after The Great Gatsby
because of it's crazy extravagance.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.125
Should we do a beef Gatsby
and a chicken Gatsby?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.628
-It's entirely up to you, my man.
-Full house.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.713
-Beef. Chicken.
-No problem, sir.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.924
-'Cause I'm living large.
-I'm here for you.

06:23.007 --> 06:23.966
I'm here for you.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.259
[chuckles]

06:25.343 --> 06:27.845
I saw something on the menu called polony.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.889
-Polony?
-Yeah, what's that?

06:29.972 --> 06:32.600
It's like ham slices basically,
but it's not ham.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.520
-What is it?
-It's difficult to explain now.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.688
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.273
We only know it as polony.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.192
So, like ham, but worse.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.151
But worse. [laughs]

06:42.235 --> 06:43.069
But not ham.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.363
No, it's not ham
'cause ham would be called ham.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.281
Ham would be called ham.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.076
This is a masala steak full house.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.786
-That's one sandwich!
-All yours, sir.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.496
This is the world's biggest sandwich,

06:53.579 --> 06:56.791
you know, other than
the 30-foot heroes at parties and stuff.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.917
[server] Thank you.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.964
This is one of the heaviest food items
I've ever held in my life.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.382
It's got to be eight pounds.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.467
Come on in, you can go right ahead.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.177
-[man] Thank you.
-[man 2] Thanks a lot.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.430
-Where are you from?
-It's nice to meet you.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.306
Los Angeles. United States.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.226
-Welcome to South Africa.
-Thank you, I like it very much.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.269
Cape Town loves you.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.354
What's your favorite sandwich?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.564
It's a masala steak.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.315
Masala steak, I have it right here.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.610
-You'll enjoy it. I promise you that.
-Thank you.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.864
You'll never go wrong with this food.
It's the best food you can get.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.909
-Did they pay you to advertise?
-No they don't pay me. I pay them.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.455
-I got a chicken one too so I can compare.
-Yeah, very beautiful.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.622
Here comes my chicken.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.042
-Lovely. Lovely. You must enjoy it.
-The chicken Gatsby.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.754
-Have a nice day. Welcome to South Africa.
-So nice to meet you, my friend.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.632
-All right, here we go. Thanks.
-[server] Have a lovely day.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.343
Look, we got a table for two.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.805
-Do you want chicken first or steak?
-I think start light with chicken.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.015
Okay. [chuckles]

07:54.098 --> 07:55.183
[Phil] Oh, my goodness.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.518
Look at this.

07:57.977 --> 07:58.853
Looks good, hey?

08:04.484 --> 08:09.197
A little spicy.
It's got that, like, red pepper, um...

08:10.281 --> 08:11.782
[Shaheen] I call it piri-piri spice.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.828
This is great.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.164
Great Gatsby.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.667
I'm gonna call him F. Scott Fitzgerald.
That's you.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.004
He's looking at me and signaling like...

08:25.922 --> 08:27.673
I'm like, "What is it?" He's going...

08:28.424 --> 08:30.176
[mouthing]

08:30.259 --> 08:33.804
If you don't hold the sandwich
with a piece of paper underneath

08:33.930 --> 08:36.390
you're gonna lose everything.
The roll is very soft

08:36.474 --> 08:39.602
and it's so massive
that you have to actually--

08:39.685 --> 08:40.853
There's an art to it...

08:40.937 --> 08:43.189
to not taking a Gatsby bath.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.108
[Shaheen] Mm.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.986
Are you gonna have space left over
for the steak?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.613
-You don't know me.
-[chuckles]

08:51.489 --> 08:53.407
I can see
we're gonna get along well. [chuckles]

08:53.491 --> 08:54.325
Yeah.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.119
[Shaheen] Unwrap this one.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.413
It's like Christmas.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.752
The name of this show might be called,
how to ruin a sweater.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.718
What do you think?
Is it too early to say which one's better?

09:13.302 --> 09:14.637
I love both. I really do,

09:14.971 --> 09:16.889
but the chicken might have...

09:17.848 --> 09:18.849
a little more...

09:20.351 --> 09:21.477
It's more unique for me.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.856
[Shaheen] You see
why I like here.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.526
Shaheen, I can't thank you enough
for taking me here.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.070
You're most welcome, Phil.
I'm glad you enjoy it.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.073
I do.

09:38.869 --> 09:42.123
[Phil] South Africa has a long history
of colonialism and conflict.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.626
Most notably, the racial segregation
and discrimination policies

09:45.710 --> 09:46.961
known as Apartheid...

09:47.044 --> 09:51.007
which was law for more than 40 years,
finally ending in 1991.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.970
You can't talk about the modern country
without talking about Nelson Mandela.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.973
This was a man whose anti-Apartheid stance

09:59.265 --> 10:03.269
made him an enemy of the state
at great personal cost for decades.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.063
He changed the course
of this country's history

10:06.147 --> 10:09.191
when he went from being a man
who was in prison for 27 years

10:09.275 --> 10:11.569
to becoming president of the country.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.948
Today, I get to meet his grandson,
Zondwa Mandela,

10:16.282 --> 10:17.867
and Zondwa's wife, Lindo,

10:17.950 --> 10:20.786
at their favorite breakfast place,
Jarryds.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.543
He founded an organization
called Mandela Legacy

10:27.627 --> 10:29.962
to help black businesses in South Africa.

10:30.921 --> 10:34.467
Do you feel like the weight of a legacy
on you or do you feel like

10:34.550 --> 10:38.721
this is something to celebrate
and to move forward positively with?

10:38.804 --> 10:42.141
I'll be honest with you,
I think I long got over the weight.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.186
I think if anything, you know,
my grandparents

10:45.269 --> 10:48.856
were very strong in terms of
trying to create

10:48.939 --> 10:51.525
a sense of independence
within their family.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.945
And so, you know, that opened up my world
to exploring business.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.906
My passion has always been business.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.241
Invariably, you are in politics because

10:59.325 --> 11:02.745
the situation you're trying to change
was created by politics.

11:02.828 --> 11:07.375
So we've got a huge concentration
of unemployed, black young people

11:08.125 --> 11:09.126
with no experience.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.881
And this is largely because of the legacy
of the Apartheid system.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.843
We get to train and give
an opportunity for jobs

11:17.927 --> 11:20.680
to many people
who've never had that opportunity.

11:20.846 --> 11:25.434
What do you think your grandfather
would make of the progress

11:25.601 --> 11:27.228
since his time to your time?

11:27.478 --> 11:31.524
Well, we're not level with the assumption
that things are the way they should be,

11:31.607 --> 11:36.028
but the point is now we need to be
grateful for what we have,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.447
knowing that a lot more could be done,

11:38.531 --> 11:41.158
but that should be celebrated
before anything else.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.952
The day he's released,

11:43.035 --> 11:45.788
the day you get to see him
outside of there,

11:45.871 --> 11:48.666
-how old were you when that happened?
-Seven years old.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.960
-Oh, boy, so you're a little kid.
-[Zondwa] Yeah.

11:51.043 --> 11:51.961
Yeah.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.256
-I just remember the day being very long.
-[Phil laughs]

11:55.756 --> 11:57.591
Yeah, let me start there.

11:57.675 --> 11:58.759
It was very long.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.636
Uh, but I mean, look, it was--

12:01.011 --> 12:03.764
I think the energy
was just something else.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.934
I mean, it was really a special day. Yeah.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.022
-And you have kids.
-Yeah.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.359
Two very lovely, very active children.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.778
-How old are they?
-Seven and six.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.740
Those are good ages. I like that age.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.576
-I know, tough for you. Yes, but it's...
-Really?

12:23.659 --> 12:24.660
[laughs]

12:24.744 --> 12:27.413
-But they're fun, right?
-[Zondwa] Completely.

12:28.038 --> 12:28.956
Just like mine.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.542
-[Phil] That's recent?
-[Lindo] That's recent.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.128
[Phil] Yes, at least they're running
towards you.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.629
[Lindo chuckles]

12:35.713 --> 12:36.714
Thank goodness.

12:36.839 --> 12:37.923
[Phil] Very cute.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.216
I don't want to scare you,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.302
but in the teenage years... [chuckles]

12:42.595 --> 12:44.263
...I think nature makes it so

12:44.513 --> 12:47.600
that you become jerks to them...

12:48.100 --> 12:50.144
and they become jerks to you.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.604
And the reason for this is

12:51.687 --> 12:55.024
to make the transition
to them leaving a little easier.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.817
Ah.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.736
-So there's a silver lining?
-[Phil] Make sense?

12:58.819 --> 13:02.448
-[Lindo] You've given me hope.
-Yes, they-- Don't worry.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.365
[Lindo] Okay.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.910
[Phil] Yes, I give the Mandelas hope.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.828
To progress.

13:08.996 --> 13:09.914
Progress.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.248
Thank you so much.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.167
-Thank you.
-[Lindo] Thank you too.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.464
[Phil] The old warehouse district
in Cape Town is called Woodstock.

13:18.964 --> 13:23.219
And within Woodstock, this enclave of
buildings used to be The Old Biscuit Mill.

13:24.762 --> 13:28.390
And that's where you'll find one
of the 50 best restaurants in the world.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.476
This is the Test Kitchen,

13:31.018 --> 13:33.270
run by Chef Luke Dale Roberts.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.441
It's very innovative
and it's really accessible.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.694
And by accessible,
I mean it tastes very, very good.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.949
The restaurant is split into two rooms,
one light and one dark.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.451
Come with me to the dark side

13:47.701 --> 13:49.328
for cocktails and snacks.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.831
This is-- You call this the dark room?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.375
Yeah, yeah. And when you're coming in
straight from work,

13:54.458 --> 13:58.003
you might be a little bit stressed out.
It's nice to have a soft landing.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.881
-Yeah.
-That's why I wanted to create this vibe.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.800
Everybody looks good in low light.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.594
-In the dark, exactly.
-Everybody looks good in the dark.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.058
The man who pilots my soft landing
is named X.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.520
[ice shaking]

14:14.603 --> 14:15.479
I hear action.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.440
[Phil] How are you?

14:18.524 --> 14:19.400
Good, and you?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.153
-Here's an Old Fashioned.
-Old Fashioned.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.447
[Luke] Yeah, smoked Old Fashioned.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.491
[Phil] Why is it called smoked? Oh.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.742
[Luke] Yeah.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.286
-The reveal is good.
-[Luke] Yeah.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.914
So that's made
with Jerusalem artichokes and kumquats.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.165
Wow.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.042
[coughs]

14:37.126 --> 14:38.168
And smoke.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.378
[laughs]

14:40.212 --> 14:42.423
It is beautiful.
I just took too big a hit...

14:43.007 --> 14:44.508
of the smoke, man.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.178
That's fantastic.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.391
[Phil] All right, now what are you
drinking over there? I'll trade you.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.101
[Luke] This is the Belvedere flower.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.769
-[Phil] Yes.
-So it's vodka-based, um...

14:56.312 --> 14:57.187
Basil syrup.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.568
X! X is short for excellent.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.820
[Luke chuckles]

15:11.452 --> 15:13.996
Here comes pork rinds
or chicharrón, really.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.877
[Phil] And a dip made from Guinness.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.922
Oh. Hello.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.216
It sounds a little disgusting,
but it's actually delicious.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.010
[Phil] Come on.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.303
[Luke] Dig in, you first.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.307
[Luke] Yeah!

15:39.980 --> 15:41.315
I like that face.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.526
Mm.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.154
[Phil] This is beer and what else?
Cream, I'm guessing?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.365
It's basically a beer mayonnaise.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.492
[Luke] It's wholesome. It's good for you.

15:51.575 --> 15:55.162
-Just pig fat, beer, cream-- [chuckles]
-Yeah. And alcohol.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.749
Those are my food groups
I try to get every day.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.919
[Phil] Now we go
from the dark to the light.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.630
-It's quite biblical almost, isn't it?
-[Phil] Yes. Yes.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.885
♪ Ah ♪

16:12.054 --> 16:15.557
[Phil] Inside the light room is some of
the most imaginative food I've ever seen.

16:16.266 --> 16:20.145
[Marcus] All right, so first up we're
serving a 12-hour smoked sea bass tartare.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.940
On top you'll find
lemon-compressed cucumber,

16:23.023 --> 16:25.025
-a little barley wafer crisp.
-[Phil] Yes.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.860
Then I finish it off with two ingredients.

16:26.944 --> 16:31.448
-The first is a horseradish-cream snow.
-[Phil] Oh. Yes!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.119
And then some iodine.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.414
[Marcus] Not quite, it's a lovage oil.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.331
[Phil] Lovage!

16:39.415 --> 16:40.416
[Marcus] There we go.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.334
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.961
Bon appétit.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.006
Mm.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.634
I knew when he started sprinkling
the horseradish I was going to love this.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.388
-[Phil] Hello.
-[Marcus] Hi.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.931
Ooh.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.851
[Phil] The meal continues
with pancetta-wrapped sea scallops.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.729
And chef has
sweetcorn risotto with snow crab.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.650
All right, that's great.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.193
[Phil] Trade.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.695
This is the way to do it.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.824
I swear this is
a real test of compatibility.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.452
Will your spouse share food with you?

17:16.744 --> 17:17.703
Yeah, yeah.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.580
I don't think I could live
with somebody that--

17:19.663 --> 17:21.457
I don't even think I can be friends.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.876
-If they wouldn't share?
-If they don't want to split.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.587
No. That's like the litmus test.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.213
Always share.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.392
-[Phil] Hello.
-[Luke] Hello, Mr. Belly.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.311
[Phil] Say hello to my belly.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.063
[Luke chuckles]

17:53.864 --> 17:55.574
You know what I said about sharing?

17:55.991 --> 17:57.993
-Yeah.
-I didn't mean it.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.162
[chuckles]

18:00.245 --> 18:01.288
Mm.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.923
[Phil] The reason the seafood
is so good here is it come from here.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.717
So I'm going down to Hout Bay to try some.

18:15.135 --> 18:18.514
Today I'm meeting Lisa Chait
who's a local TV producer

18:18.597 --> 18:20.933
and writer and big foodie.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.853
So, there are sharks in here, yes?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.189
That's where people go in the cages?

18:27.564 --> 18:30.859
No, no, that would be further
on the other side, further up here.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.528
-Indian Ocean.
-Have you done it?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.196
-No, no interest.
-[chuckles]

18:34.279 --> 18:37.449
No, seriously, I have no interest.
What do I wanna go-- A shark--

18:37.533 --> 18:41.245
Then they throw meat into the water,
and then, you know, "Hey, sharky sharky."

18:41.328 --> 18:43.080
It's stupid. It's ridiculous.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.707
[Phil] Somebody told me that they did this

18:45.958 --> 18:49.211
and the boat--
It was so rough, the water--

18:49.294 --> 18:50.254
Everyone throws up.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.588
-That's the-- [laughs]
-Everyone.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.924
I'm like, "Well, uh, game over.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.592
You don't have to talk anymore.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.760
I'm not doing that."

18:56.844 --> 18:59.888
And then-- Oh, yes, the water is--

18:59.972 --> 19:02.683
-You can't believe how cold the water is.
-Yeah.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.102
-Two strikes against me now.
-[chuckles]

19:05.185 --> 19:08.355
And didn't even get
to the shark with me yet.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.607
[Phil] I don't wanna see
a man-eating fish.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.110
I want to be a man eating fish.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.366
Luckily, Lisa's favorite seafood place
is right here on Hout Bay.

19:19.950 --> 19:23.537
[Phil] Here we are. Africa's favorite.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.913
In all of Africa.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.331
All the people.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.835
Ethiopians, they say,
"This is our favorite."

19:30.335 --> 19:31.879
So we must have fish and chips, right?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.088
-This is the local.
-We do.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.424
-And we have to have slap chips.
-Slap chips.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.551
-Have you got hake?
-Hake, calamari, and chips.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.553
-That's a good idea.
-Anything else?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.013
Hi, how are you?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.806
-[woman] Good, and you?
-Very nice.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.349
Nice to see you.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.935
-[Phil] Is it all fried?
-[server] Yeah.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.937
-We gotta have one thing grilled.
-Yeah.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.105
So I can tell my doctor.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.858
[both chuckle]

19:56.945 --> 19:58.238
-Are you excited?
-I am excited.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.200
I'm starving. I didn't eat.
This is going to be my breakfast.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.452
So you were here as a child.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.370
-[Lisa] Born and bred.
-Born and bred.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.081
And you lived through the change...

20:08.498 --> 20:09.750
with the end of Apartheid.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.921
It was very exciting because you knew
that Mandela one day would be released...

20:14.004 --> 20:14.838
Yes.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.798
...and the country
would have its first election.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.551
When we all stood in the queue
for the first proper election

20:19.635 --> 20:21.053
and everybody could be together,

20:22.012 --> 20:24.473
you can't describe. You can't describe it.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.892
That must have been some feeling.

20:26.975 --> 20:27.976
It was amazing.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.269
Hey, here's my friend.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.022
Come on. Nice.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.566
Prawns, hake, calamari, and chips.
Snoek only.

20:34.942 --> 20:35.901
-Fantastic.
-Thank you.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.903
Thanks. It's all about slap chips for me.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.448
So the chips are not so slap,
so slap would be like floppy.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.201
-Floppy. In the old days--
-That's how you like it?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.786
Yeah, I like really mushy and floppy.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.830
That's how it used to be when I was
growing up. But they're good.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.374
You like mushy and floppy.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.710
-I like mushy and floppy.
-[crew laughs]

20:53.794 --> 20:56.338
-No jokes, people. No jokes.
-I understand. Yeah.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.758
[Lisa] This is hake. This is kind of
like the standard thing that you get.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.009
I'm doing it.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.224
[Lisa] Ah.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.809
That's well done. I mean, it's good.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.852
It really is. It's really fresh.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.438
-This is special.
-It swam just an hour ago.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.609
I don't like when the batter is too thick.
This is just nice and light

21:17.693 --> 21:20.112
and almost dry on the outside.

21:20.195 --> 21:24.908
And the fish inside is so... juicy.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.203
If you got that in a restaurant,
a sit down restaurant,

21:28.287 --> 21:30.998
got that piece of fish,
you'd be very, very happy.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.541
Beautifully done.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.170
-Stunning. Stunning.
-[woman] Thank you. Thank you.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.797
You're a great chef.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.340
[chuckles] Thank you very much.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.175
-You'll be back for more.
-[Phil] Okay.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.470
-[Lisa] Have some snoek.
-[Phil] Okay.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.180
This is a deeper-water fish.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.601
You'll see it's a lot more gamey,
but there are a lot of bones in snoek.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.065
Sometimes people say,
"Oh, it's flaky and it's a white fish,"

21:57.149 --> 21:59.318
and that describes
90 percent of fish, right?

21:59.401 --> 22:03.905
But... this one is more meaty.
It's got some density to it.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.615
-Right?
-Yeah, careful the bones.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.659
-Careful the bones.
-[choking]

22:07.743 --> 22:09.077
[chuckles] Don't die on me, Phil.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.833
[Lisa] Yeah. Well done.
You've been snoeked.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.550
[Phil] Such a quaint weapon now,
the cannon.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.470
[Lisa chuckles] So, they would have been,
obviously, to protect the bay.

22:26.553 --> 22:29.139
On the other side of this mountain
is the huge naval base.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.682
-The British naval base.
-[Phil] Ah.

22:30.766 --> 22:34.686
[Lisa] So if you want to see
serious military things...

22:34.811 --> 22:36.271
-[Phil] No.
-[Lisa] That's... [laughs]

22:52.204 --> 22:54.498
So my brother has a friend from America,

22:54.873 --> 22:58.794
named Michael, who moved here
and married a lovely South African lady.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.381
And they had a boy named Jack,
who's five years old.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.884
And I came up with the perfect assignment
for a five-year-old kid.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.763
Michael and Jack today are meeting me
at Honest Chocolate.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.766
-I'm excited. Are you excited?
-Yeah.

23:13.517 --> 23:17.104
You walk in there, and it is paradise.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.981
Chocolate. Chocolate. Chocolate.
Chocolate. Chocolate.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.692
Much of it grown and harvested
right here in Africa.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.028
-Hello!
-Hey, Phil, Anthony.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.071
-Anthony.
-Hello.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.531
What are you going to have?

23:28.573 --> 23:30.450
I found some skulls over there.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.910
[Anthony] Like this guy?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.329
-[Jack] Like that guy.
-[Phil] What!?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.414
[Anthony] Go ahead.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.665
[Jack] Thanks.

23:37.165 --> 23:37.999
Chomp him.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.501
[Phil] He likes the dark side.

23:40.919 --> 23:41.795
What's inside?

23:42.003 --> 23:42.838
Brains?

23:42.921 --> 23:43.839
Nothing.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.132
-[Michael] None.
-[all chuckle]

23:45.215 --> 23:46.258
[Phil] Just like my skull.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.093
What should I try?

23:48.176 --> 23:50.178
We're gonna start you off
on something pure.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.222
This is a raw chocolate.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.057
This is a 72 percent.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.728
[Phil] This is the most serious chocolate
I've ever had in my life.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.856
And I've got to be honest,
Honest Chocolate,

24:00.939 --> 24:02.441
I'm not sure this one is for me.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.276
This is not sweet at all.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.194
Try this guy, so...

24:06.611 --> 24:09.114
-[Phil] Which guy?
-This guy. This is our original truffle.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.366
[Phil] Jack, should I give you
a piece of this?

24:11.450 --> 24:13.034
-No.
-[Phil] Nope? Okay.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.328
I'm not sure that's my kind of chocolate.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.663
[Anthony laughs]

24:16.746 --> 24:17.831
[Phil] Smart kid.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.916
What do you have else to suggest?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.919
This is not for the uninitiated,
I don't believe.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.755
I think you have to work up
to some of this stuff.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.215
However...

24:28.049 --> 24:29.718
There's a brownie on that counter

24:30.218 --> 24:34.639
that is the single best brownie
I ever had in my life.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.976
It was gooey and soft and really dark.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.102
Look at that.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.189
[Michael chuckles]

24:42.272 --> 24:43.315
[Jack laughs]

24:43.398 --> 24:44.608
I don't think he likes it.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.109
[Michael laughs]

24:48.320 --> 24:49.154
You want some?

24:49.237 --> 24:50.071
No.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.781
[all laugh]

24:51.865 --> 24:54.159
Speaking of the best brownie I ever had...

24:54.868 --> 24:55.827
Thank you.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.541
Am I wrong?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.253
Am I wrong?

25:06.713 --> 25:08.590
Have you had a better brownie than that?

25:14.721 --> 25:16.223
Everybody's eating brownies.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.975
[Richard] Who's got the milk?

25:19.059 --> 25:20.185
I think we're on a break.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.897
[Richard chuckles]

25:30.070 --> 25:32.531
[Phil] Next, I head
to the beautiful Bo-Kaap neighborhood.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.911
This is an area that's home
to South Africa's oldest Muslim community

25:37.994 --> 25:39.246
going back centuries.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.292
Past a lane of candy-colored houses,

25:45.001 --> 25:46.836
I find the home of Faeeza Abrahams.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.094
Oh.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.971
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.348
-You are Faeeza?
-I'm Faeeza.

25:58.431 --> 26:02.352
Faeeza runs a cooking school
and restaurant right out of her home.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.689
She teaches the cuisine
of her Cape Malay heritage,

26:05.772 --> 26:09.484
which is kind of a mash-up
between Southeast Asian and Indian

26:09.568 --> 26:13.113
from the days when Indonesia and
the Cape region were both Dutch colonies.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.489
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.782
-Hi.
-Safiyyah?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.742
-Raeesa?
-Yeah.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.703
It's nice to meet you.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.496
Nice to meet you.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.459
[Phil] While daughters
Nurahn and Lamis make dinner,

26:26.751 --> 26:28.545
I get to know my dining companions.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.338
Yes, let me see.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.882
-What are you watching?
-YouTube!

26:32.966 --> 26:35.844
What if I told you, you were
going to be in a video right now.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.971
You know how you make a video?

26:38.847 --> 26:39.889
You take a camera...

26:40.432 --> 26:41.516
-I know.
-Right.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.268
And then you watch everybody.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.769
And you're watching people,

26:44.853 --> 26:46.062
and that's the video.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.523
You'll be able to see you on the phone.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.734
On everybody's phone.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.278
On everybody's phone, that's right.
On everybody's phone.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.575
[Phil] As other influences
come into the neighborhood,

26:58.658 --> 27:01.786
Faeeza's cooking
helps keep her culture alive.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.501
You know, our culture,
we don't eat with knives and forks, hey.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.253
We mainly eat with our hands.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.921
I love eating with my hands.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.673
I just might need another napkin.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.675
Yes, definitely. Get some napkins there.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.470
-And a hose.
-And a-- [laughs]

27:20.347 --> 27:23.933
[Phil] Here comes a big bowl
of chicken curry with potatoes,

27:24.017 --> 27:25.977
and you eat it almost Ethiopian style

27:26.061 --> 27:29.147
with homemade, what looks like,
pita bread or even a tortilla.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.733
And it's hot and fresh,
and you just scoop out

27:32.067 --> 27:34.277
the chicken and the sauce
and zobble it up.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.742
They also say food tastes better
when eaten with hands.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.119
-I agree. I love it.
-You think so? I think so, too.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.412
This is delicious.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.665
[Phil] It's not just good for me, right?

27:46.790 --> 27:49.709
-You guys love this, too.
-My husband's favorite dish.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.044
-This is?
-Yeah.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.170
And my kids too.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.422
Have you been to America yet?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.257
-No.
-Come on.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.511
-He doesn't--
-I don't know anybody in America, though.

27:59.594 --> 28:01.262
-But now I know you.
-Now you do.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.347
I'm the first one?

28:02.430 --> 28:04.683
Yeah-- No, I've had American tourists.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.434
Are they mostly nice?

28:06.518 --> 28:10.647
They nice. They can't actually believe
that we so nice here.

28:10.730 --> 28:13.316
-Remember the Italian you had over?
-Yeah.

28:13.400 --> 28:18.154
And he was telling her how she was
the first Muslim he's ever come across.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.657
He was like, "You're just like me,"
and he hugged her.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.118
[Phil] I find
that most people in the world

28:23.576 --> 28:26.579
are much nicer
than the governments running them.

28:26.788 --> 28:27.622
Agreed.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.624
I think, you know, when you warm,

28:29.708 --> 28:31.042
-they warm back.
-That's right.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.461
And I think
when you give off a negative feeling,

28:33.545 --> 28:36.214
then obviously,
you'll get a negative response.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.216
When they come into my home,
I give them a hug.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.510
-And when they leave, they hug me.
-Of course they do.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.345
For me, it doesn't feel like work.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.014
It feels like I'm having a dinner party.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.641
-That's how it should be.
-Yes.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.685
-You're doing what you love.
-Doing what you love.

28:48.768 --> 28:51.771
They say if you do what you love,
you'll never work a day in your life.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.192
[Phil] Another granddaughter brings
in a classic Cape Malay dessert,

28:56.651 --> 28:58.403
-koeksisters.
-Thank you.

28:58.486 --> 29:02.323
Every Sunday morning, it's breakfast
with koeksisters and coffee.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.451
You can pick it up with your hand
and eat it.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.410
-I do it.
-Yeah.

29:05.493 --> 29:08.913
I know my son wished
that he had a cooked sister.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.248
[laughs]

29:11.499 --> 29:12.834
It's a lot like a doughnut.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.420
-Yes, it is like a doughnut.
-A spicy doughnut.

29:15.503 --> 29:17.839
With spices.
There's quite a bit of spices in here.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.132
It's very good.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.508
[Faeeza] Thank you.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.386
You're not going to meet
sweeter people than this.

29:23.470 --> 29:28.183
We instantly bonded, instantly warm,
friendly, great, sweet, beautiful...

29:28.850 --> 29:30.727
I loved Faeeza. I loved her daughters.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.688
I loved the cute grandkids.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.523
-Hey!
-I'm okay.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.150
Careful.

29:37.233 --> 29:40.570
Bo-Kaap and a stop at Faeeza's,
that's a must.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.458
[Phil] This is Gugulethu,
and this is a township.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.627
And if you know anything
about townships,

29:56.169 --> 30:00.507
these are neighborhoods created by the
racial segregation policies of Apartheid.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.968
These are not communities that have a lot.

30:04.844 --> 30:10.058
And a man named Mzoli opened what's called
a braai or a barbecue place,

30:10.141 --> 30:11.601
as a way to help remedy that.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.816
Ngcawuzele Mzoli created a place
where people from all walks of life

30:17.899 --> 30:21.653
can meet, eat, have fun,
and help the local economy.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.490
Ah. Hello.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.617
[Phil] I'm welcomed
by Mzoli's daughter, Sisanda.

30:27.742 --> 30:28.827
Pleased to meet you.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.119
I'm pleased to meet you.

30:30.203 --> 30:35.416
And I was told I have to come here
and I have to try all your meats.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.545
-Experience everything.
-Experience everything. That's my motto.

30:42.966 --> 30:46.135
[Phil] You can use this place as
a butcher's shop and bring the meat home,

30:46.219 --> 30:48.930
but the fun
is having it barbecued right here

30:49.013 --> 30:50.223
and eating it in the back.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.185
Bowl of meat... ready to go.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.688
[Phil] My cardiologist will be thrilled.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.399
Where am I going?

31:05.113 --> 31:06.322
[Phil] Wow.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.032
Hello, everybody.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.453
I'm not making this up,
the grill master is named...

31:12.537 --> 31:14.080
-Webber!
-[Webber] That's right.

31:14.163 --> 31:15.081
Perfect.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.250
It's smoky, huh?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.419
Don't touch your eyes.

31:19.502 --> 31:20.461
Don't touch my eyes?

31:20.753 --> 31:22.380
Okay. I'll just cry.

31:22.463 --> 31:23.965
Yeah. Don't touch your eyes.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.819
Out of the inferno.

31:48.781 --> 31:49.949
Hello.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.035
[Phil] The rule here is
you sit wherever you can.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.203
So I'm horning in
on these lucky people's lunch.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.121
-How are you?
-Kunene.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.085
-Welcome to South Africa.
-[Phil] Thanks for having me.

32:04.547 --> 32:05.506
Eugene.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.763
Look at you with the kidneys.
I don't know, lamb kidney?

32:11.846 --> 32:13.806
-Mm-hmm.
-I don't know if I ever had it.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.475
Should I taste it?

32:15.558 --> 32:17.018
-Yeah.
-[Phil] I should.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.102
You won't go wrong.

32:18.186 --> 32:21.189
[man] Okay, let's not forget to drink,
guys. Let's keep on drinking.

32:22.857 --> 32:25.318
If I don't like it, you won't be offended?

32:25.401 --> 32:26.319
No.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.489
It's nice.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.949
-I like it.
-Tastes like...

32:31.282 --> 32:32.492
First time I ever had it.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.202
Yeah. [chuckles]

32:37.789 --> 32:38.873
Wow, they're chicken!

32:41.209 --> 32:44.879
We actually get
a lot of visitors from abroad.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.881
[Phil] Yes. I'm not surprised.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.677
It's so interesting how,
when you hit it just right,

32:51.344 --> 32:52.387
the world comes.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.388
Yeah.

32:53.888 --> 32:57.850
Tell me if this is true. It used to be
a butcher just in the garage, right?

32:57.934 --> 33:00.979
-You just sold meat from the garage.
-It started informally.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.021
Yes.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.107
He used to sell
out of the trunk of his car.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.483
Out of the trunk of his car.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.861
And this is now Mzoli's now.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.656
[Phil] It's a very friendly place,
I can see.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.950
It's like a big living room.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.203
Yeah, I'm actually glad
that you noticed that.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.746
[laughs]

33:19.539 --> 33:20.832
[Webber] This is the place to be.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.917
There are times that the queue

33:23.209 --> 33:25.420
goes as far as that corner there.

33:25.962 --> 33:28.297
You wait on line? You wait on the queue?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.424
We are neighbors, hey.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.509
I just go in between.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.053
We here every day.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.221
Every day we here.

33:35.304 --> 33:38.182
We support Mzoli every day.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.977
What does Mzoli's do for this community?

33:41.060 --> 33:43.521
Job creation is number one.

33:43.604 --> 33:48.109
When you open a place like this

33:48.192 --> 33:49.444
you are employing people.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.612
You are feeding a family.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.161
This is-- This is too big for me.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.620
Somebody has to help me.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.463
-Who wants more chicken?
-I cannot eat anymore.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.632
I don't want to ruin my summer body!

34:11.716 --> 34:13.009
[chuckles]

34:19.682 --> 34:21.893
[Phil] It's late afternoon,
and I need to refuel.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.812
Thankfully,
I'm in a great city for coffee.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.902
Africa is the birthplace of coffee.

34:32.570 --> 34:36.115
And one of the best cups on the continent
comes from Truth Coffee

34:36.699 --> 34:39.077
and the singular vision of this guy.

34:39.869 --> 34:43.790
You're never gonna meet someone
as serious about what they do

34:43.873 --> 34:46.584
as owner David Donde is about coffee.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.254
And by the way, a character.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.300
-It's been your whole life.
-No, not at all.

34:54.383 --> 34:57.595
I started off as a chicken farmer.
Hotelier, restauranteur.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.180
Photographer.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.600
-A lot of different lines.
-But you loved coffee?

35:02.683 --> 35:05.937
Coffee was complicated enough for me
to go down the rabbit hole.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.689
My journey started pretty simply.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.149
Why can't coffee in the cup

35:10.233 --> 35:13.736
deliver on the flavors promised
by the aroma of freshly ground coffee?

35:14.987 --> 35:17.865
-Exactly.
-It's just... a chemistry experiment.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.618
I can make a really good cup of coffee
at room temperature

35:20.701 --> 35:22.245
for, let's say, 18 to 20 hours

35:22.328 --> 35:26.290
or in 25 seconds in an espresso machine
at a high temperature and pressure.

35:26.457 --> 35:30.211
Essentially, I'm doing the same thing
and getting slightly different results.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.296
-From two minutes with you...
-Yes.

35:32.672 --> 35:35.133
...I can tell how into it you are,
because you were like--

35:35.216 --> 35:39.011
You told the crew
when this timer is done, it has to go.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.347
We're not waiting for your microphone,
for your camera.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.807
This coffee comes first.

35:42.890 --> 35:46.811
The coffee doesn't understand the
complications of our life, nor should it.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.232
That should be one
of the better cups of coffee you've had.

35:52.441 --> 35:53.276
Very confident.

35:56.821 --> 35:57.905
So what do you think?

35:57.989 --> 35:59.115
I think it's fantastic.

36:00.241 --> 36:05.746
So I would say that the difference
between great coffee and good coffee

36:06.080 --> 36:08.499
is a long, lingering,
and pleasant aftertaste.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.544
Okay, on to the milky coffee.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.465
Oh, it's delicious.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.760
That's a blend I created
from the beginning to shine through milk.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.513
-[Phil] This is double macchiato?
-[David] Yes, macchiato.

36:22.805 --> 36:23.931
It's a very popular one.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.852
This is delicious and entirely different
from everything else I had.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.729
If you notice,
I'm having three cups of coffee.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.440
Which probably means I don't want
to talk to you in an hour's time.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.941
[Phil] You won't be able to talk

36:34.025 --> 36:36.235
-'cause I'll be doing all the talking.
-[David] Exactly.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.653
[Phil] After we're done,

36:37.737 --> 36:40.239
he says, "You wanna come in the back?"
"What's in the back?"

36:40.323 --> 36:41.449
"I'm doing a coffee tasting."

36:42.742 --> 36:47.413
This time it's cold brew.
I'm trying every kind they make, I think.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.124
Each of these
has been removed from the vat

36:50.208 --> 36:53.169
just like you would with wine
at various points in time.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.754
We kind of find...

36:54.837 --> 36:57.131
where's the break point
where joy is happening?

36:57.215 --> 36:59.967
-You know, what else is going on?
-I love that expression,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.511
"The break point
for where joy is happening."

37:02.845 --> 37:03.763
Should we get started?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.182
[slurps]

37:07.475 --> 37:09.435
Little bit of sweetness
coming through now.

37:11.854 --> 37:12.730
[David] Your opinion?

37:13.272 --> 37:15.608
I'm like... blablabla. [chuckles]

37:15.691 --> 37:17.443
I've been shot out of a cannon.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.238
[slurping]

37:20.321 --> 37:21.948
[David] So, number four.

37:22.031 --> 37:22.907
[slurps]

37:22.990 --> 37:25.493
-[Phil chuckles]
-[slurps]

37:25.576 --> 37:27.370
[David] Something broke there.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.039
[Phil] I really-- I didn't know
what to do with myself...

37:30.581 --> 37:32.500
since I had seven or eight cups of coffee.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.921
Luckily, they have one of these.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.843
[Phil]
Against the stunning backdrop of Hout Bay,

37:42.927 --> 37:45.137
you can find
some pretty rough neighborhoods.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.556
But, if you head over
to Bay Harbour Market,

37:47.848 --> 37:50.017
you'll also find people
making a difference.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.895
There are all kinds of heroes.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.814
[Peter] When you hear my voice, clap once.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.733
Here's a lady named Helena Fagan.

37:59.443 --> 38:02.530
She started an arts program
on the top floor of the market.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.616
If you hear my voice, clap twice.

38:06.158 --> 38:08.369
-If you hear my voice, go...
-[all] Shh.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.620
Here we go. Here we go.

38:11.163 --> 38:13.207
[Phil] She took all the empty office space

38:13.291 --> 38:15.960
and turned it into dance studios
and music studios,

38:16.043 --> 38:19.380
and the kids come and sing and dance
and they do arts and crafts.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.133
Welcome to the Harvest Youth Project!

38:22.216 --> 38:23.676
What happened to these kids?

38:33.894 --> 38:37.356
[Helena] We started
this whole idea of creating a place

38:37.440 --> 38:38.733
where the children feel safe,

38:38.816 --> 38:41.736
where they can come get away
from crime and the grime,

38:41.819 --> 38:45.948
and the circumstances up in the harbor
where drug lords use kids

38:46.032 --> 38:50.244
to actually do their shoot-outs
and to do their poaching.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.288
So we're trying to create alternatives.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.791
[cheering]

38:55.875 --> 38:57.710
[Helena] Chad is their choreographer.

38:59.879 --> 39:02.590
He does recording. He's a keyboard player.

39:02.673 --> 39:03.674
He composes.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.058
[Chad] Whoa.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.106
We don't just do hip-hop,
we do all styles.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.942
So, house, also pop and funk.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.070
And maybe a little bit of old-school.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.364
[dance music playing]

39:41.712 --> 39:44.423
[cheering and applause]

39:47.635 --> 39:49.136
[Phil] And a few other superstars.

39:51.013 --> 39:52.515
[cheering]

40:01.357 --> 40:03.234
Oh!

40:10.032 --> 40:11.700
[cheering]

40:13.494 --> 40:15.413
[Helena] Nice, Franky.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.751
[cheering]

40:20.835 --> 40:23.295
[Phil] And this is Peter.
He's a rapper and a teacher,

40:23.379 --> 40:26.340
and he got his start
as a student here in the program.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.134
Life isn't easy you know, so...

40:28.551 --> 40:31.053
we're gonna keep on inspiring,
keep on motivating.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.641
[cheering]

40:37.560 --> 40:38.394
[Phil] Yay!

40:38.477 --> 40:40.771
[Helena] Our stars.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.732
How long have you been dancing?

40:44.608 --> 40:46.902
-Two years.
-Two years? How about you?

40:46.986 --> 40:49.321
-Five months.
-[Phil] Five months?

40:49.405 --> 40:50.990
-One.
-One month?

40:52.116 --> 40:53.117
You're all so good.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.244
Thank you so much. That was awesome.

41:00.833 --> 41:04.420
Thank you.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.721
[Phil] I'm walking down the street
near where I'm staying.

41:13.804 --> 41:18.601
And here's a place that's been recommended
called Melissa's, so I go in.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.188
They make their own ice cream.
They make their own pies.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.732
Then jams. Youngberry.

41:25.941 --> 41:27.485
I might be too old for that.

41:28.152 --> 41:32.323
I heard that this is the best snack shop
and coffee shop in Cape Town.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.532
Yes, it is.

41:33.616 --> 41:37.203
So I'm gonna look for good things to eat.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.746
[Leah] Would you like a basket?

41:39.288 --> 41:41.332
-A shopping basket?
-Yes. Yes.

41:41.415 --> 41:42.374
That's a good idea.

41:42.917 --> 41:43.792
What's that?

41:43.876 --> 41:46.504
Okay, this is
a chocolate caramel muesli bar.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.340
-Chocolate caramel muesli bar.
-Caramel muesli bar.

41:49.423 --> 41:51.008
-I should take it like this?
-Yes.

41:51.091 --> 41:53.093
-We don't wanna--
-Are they for takeaway?

41:53.177 --> 41:54.887
-Must I give you a box.
-Honestly...

41:55.638 --> 41:57.806
-It's not going to get that far.
-Okay.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.897
Yummy.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.111
I'm very glad I came in here.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.864
-Be careful, don't bite your tongue.
-Okay.

42:20.329 --> 42:23.332
We have chocolate chip cookies.
That one is my favorite.

42:23.415 --> 42:25.876
I'm getting it.
That's all you needed to say.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.297
Okay, your bill is 716.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.423
What!?

42:31.507 --> 42:33.425
-Yes. It's worth it.
-All right.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.510
I think so.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.221
-Am I paying?
-[Richard] No, you're not.

42:37.763 --> 42:40.766
All right. We're showing you
calling the police as I run out the door.

42:40.849 --> 42:41.892
Okay.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.687
[crew laughing]

42:53.070 --> 42:54.989
[Phil] As delectable
as Melissa's treats are,

42:55.072 --> 42:56.865
they're even better when you share them.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.367
Come here, sit over here.

42:58.909 --> 42:59.827
I'm still working.

42:59.910 --> 43:03.372
I just wanted to offer you a plate
so you can just put some of your...

43:03.914 --> 43:06.250
-Instead of just throwing it everywhere?
-Yeah.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.376
Sit right here.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.254
Espresso, sir.

43:10.337 --> 43:11.255
Bless you.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.925
-This is the best I ever had.
-It's divine.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.177
-So divine.
-You want a piece? Come on.

43:17.261 --> 43:18.345
Yeah, why not?

43:18.429 --> 43:20.180
Take from the other side.
I bit on that side.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.141
Okay. Mm.

43:22.224 --> 43:24.018
It's so soft and fresh, right?

43:24.101 --> 43:26.520
-Mm-hmm. And there's nuts inside.
-Yes.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.564
This was very good, too.
Here, have one of these.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.153
-Good, right?
-Mm-hmm.

43:35.070 --> 43:35.946
All right.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.239
Tell me about you.

43:37.573 --> 43:38.782
-What do you do?
-Why?

43:38.866 --> 43:41.076
Besides this. I'm just interested.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.370
I don't share my stuff with customers.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.957
Only when you become my friend.

43:47.499 --> 43:49.668
I can't be your friend and customer?

43:49.752 --> 43:51.754
How about a customer that became a friend?

43:51.837 --> 43:54.757
Okay. After that,
when you become my friend,

43:54.840 --> 43:56.800
-then I'll tell you--
-Then you'll tell me things?

43:56.884 --> 43:59.470
[Leah] Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

43:59.553 --> 44:00.596
How old are you?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.349
When we're friends, I'll tell you.

44:03.432 --> 44:04.308
Mm-hmm.

44:04.391 --> 44:05.517
We are not friends.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.394
[chuckles]

44:10.272 --> 44:12.608
-Fifty-seven.
-Wow.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.277
I'm 29.

44:16.779 --> 44:17.738
[chuckles]

44:17.821 --> 44:19.782
Why are you laughing? Do I look old?

44:19.948 --> 44:21.825
No. You actually look younger.

44:21.909 --> 44:22.868
Thank you.

44:22.951 --> 44:26.038
Now you're supposed to say,
you look very good for being very old.

44:26.455 --> 44:30.209
No, I said it's not that bad
that you're... [whispers] 57.

44:30.709 --> 44:32.044
[laughs]

44:32.127 --> 44:34.588
It's so bad to have to... [mouths]

44:35.673 --> 44:37.675
I've now spoiled my dinner because of you.

44:37.841 --> 44:38.676
-Really?
-Yeah.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.178
Have you tried our breakfast?
It's the best.

44:41.261 --> 44:42.680
I should have breakfast here?

44:43.055 --> 44:43.931
I'm coming.

44:44.473 --> 44:45.307
When?

44:45.391 --> 44:46.809
I'm coming this week.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.435
I'm gonna see you again. You'll see.

44:48.519 --> 44:51.188
-Now that we're friends, I have to come.
-Yeah, we are friends.

44:51.563 --> 44:56.276
I'm always looking for people to talk to,
and sometimes you get lucky.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.362
Thank you.

44:58.445 --> 45:01.407
This is what you hope for.
First of all, when you're making a show,

45:01.490 --> 45:04.618
and second of all, when you just travel
and you get to meet great people.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.578
-Leah.
-Yeah.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.248
[Phil] And you know what?
I did come back for breakfast.

45:09.331 --> 45:10.541
Three more times.

45:20.259 --> 45:23.178
South Africa is also famous

45:23.262 --> 45:27.766
for having one of the best wine countries
in the world and one of the oldest.

45:29.727 --> 45:34.648
We're at Babylonstoren,
which is a winery from 1692.

45:35.232 --> 45:39.611
Its stunning vineyards and gardens
were set up to supply passing Dutch ships

45:39.820 --> 45:44.074
as they rounded the tip of Africa
on their way to India and the Far East.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.535
There's not a bad view really.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.121
It's an incredible place to stay.

45:50.164 --> 45:53.834
Just don't oversleep because
you don't want to miss their breakfast.

46:15.397 --> 46:17.566
[Phil] A Taracco blood orange.

46:25.991 --> 46:27.034
That's really good.

46:31.246 --> 46:35.751
Lovely poached eggs with lovely
smoked trout. That's all, and enjoy.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.628
[Phil] Hello.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.296
Hello.

46:39.379 --> 46:40.672
Oh, oh, oh.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.140
Eggs on farm. Good.

46:53.894 --> 46:54.895
[Phil] It's so good.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.239
[Phil] I wanna see
where that amazing breakfast came from,

47:05.322 --> 47:08.826
so I'm heading out into their beautiful
gardens with Gundula and Constance,

47:08.909 --> 47:12.830
two of the gardeners here who let me
tag along as they pick goodies for lunch.

47:13.580 --> 47:14.915
This is your office.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.834
Yes, the biggest one you can find.

47:16.917 --> 47:17.960
Not bad.

47:20.712 --> 47:23.549
And were you professional gardeners
before you came here?

47:23.632 --> 47:27.219
I started gardening
when I was two years old, so...

47:27.302 --> 47:31.598
It's one of those things that all
the cultures, especially my culture, does

47:31.682 --> 47:33.350
when they're actually growing up.

47:33.433 --> 47:35.978
[Phil] And it transfers
into cooking then too, doesn't it?

47:36.061 --> 47:38.522
Oh, yes. And healthy cooking
by the end of the day.

47:38.605 --> 47:39.731
-[Phil] Right.
-[chuckles]

47:41.775 --> 47:45.487
[Phil] They grow more than 300 kinds
of edible and medicinal plants here.

47:46.029 --> 47:48.073
A few with some fairly unappetizing names.

47:48.490 --> 47:49.950
Spekboom.

47:50.033 --> 47:51.159
Taste it.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.454
I like it, very fresh. It's good.

47:55.831 --> 47:59.084
Now the English name: elephant food.

47:59.626 --> 48:01.253
-Elephant food?
-Exactly.

48:01.753 --> 48:03.881
-Because elephants eat this?
-They love it.

48:03.964 --> 48:06.425
And 300 years ago
when this farm was established,

48:06.508 --> 48:08.135
-the elephants were roaming...
-What!?

48:08.218 --> 48:09.052
...munching away.

48:09.136 --> 48:12.097
-This was elephant valley.
-Of course, we're in Africa. I forgot.

48:12.180 --> 48:14.474
[all chuckle]

48:15.893 --> 48:18.645
Why don't you keep an elephant or two?
We can't?

48:18.729 --> 48:19.855
They'll come back.

48:19.938 --> 48:21.481
They will? When we're dead.

48:22.691 --> 48:25.068
Okay, I'd like to take us
into the main garden next.

48:25.152 --> 48:28.030
-We'll go wherever you say.
-[Richard] I think you're going that way.

48:28.113 --> 48:29.531
All right, I'll go this way.

48:29.615 --> 48:31.325
[Constance chuckles]

48:33.327 --> 48:34.244
Paradise.

48:35.370 --> 48:38.332
I want to take you to our radish field.
We have quite a few different kinds.

48:38.415 --> 48:40.167
No lady has ever told me that.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.960
[chuckles]

48:43.462 --> 48:45.672
-They're like sweeties, like candies.
-[Phil] Yeah.

48:45.756 --> 48:46.757
That's some red.

48:47.758 --> 48:48.759
Linseed.

48:49.259 --> 48:52.054
-Oh. So pretty.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

48:54.431 --> 48:55.641
That was a little bitter.

48:57.267 --> 48:58.852
I drink that as a tea most often.

48:59.394 --> 49:00.228
[Phil] Not to eat?

49:00.312 --> 49:02.439
Well, you could,
but I generally drink it as a tea.

49:02.522 --> 49:03.732
I did. That was a mistake.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.567
But... [chuckles]

49:05.651 --> 49:06.610
[laughs]

49:07.152 --> 49:09.446
-[Phil] Okay.
-That's little pansies.

49:11.114 --> 49:12.866
[Phil]
That's what they called me at school.

49:17.371 --> 49:18.372
Can you eat this?

49:18.705 --> 49:22.042
I prefer drinking the tea of that
and I like eating these flowers.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.585
They've got nectar in them.

49:23.669 --> 49:24.711
-Really?
-Yeah.

49:29.216 --> 49:31.343
-We've got--
-A little sweet juice in there.

49:32.010 --> 49:33.845
What!? That's amazing.

49:34.888 --> 49:37.432
It's so much better
than that other crap you just gave me.

49:37.516 --> 49:38.517
This is great.

49:41.144 --> 49:43.188
[Phil] Can I at least
carry your bag for you?

49:43.522 --> 49:45.524
-Oh, you're so gracious. Thank you.
-Come on.

49:45.607 --> 49:47.067
Oh, this was a mistake.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.151
Okay.

49:49.569 --> 49:52.155
We have plenty of snakes,
like cobras and puff adders.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.073
[Phil] What!?

49:53.156 --> 49:56.994
And this is wild garlic
that is a barrier to keep out the snakes.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.329
They should make garlic boots.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.206
[Constance] They should.

50:01.289 --> 50:03.166
[all chuckle]

50:03.959 --> 50:06.253
[Phil] By the way, I love garlic.
It wouldn't keep me away.

50:07.087 --> 50:10.215
Isn't roasted garlic, like,
one of the greatest things you can eat?

50:10.424 --> 50:12.759
You can, and it's actually
healthy for you as well.

50:12.884 --> 50:14.511
-But...
-I love it so much.

50:14.594 --> 50:16.513
-I'm not into garlic that much.
-Really?

50:16.596 --> 50:17.472
-No.
-How about you?

50:18.015 --> 50:20.600
I don't touch garlic.
It doesn't even come into my house.

50:21.143 --> 50:25.689
It's something that makes you healthy,

50:25.772 --> 50:28.275
but also heavy,

50:28.358 --> 50:30.986
because it works with your lower chakras.

50:33.447 --> 50:36.867
I don't care about any of that.
It tastes really good.

50:39.077 --> 50:40.829
-That's the idea.
-For the lower chakras.

50:40.912 --> 50:43.665
-So it hurts your lower chakras?
-It heats them up.

50:43.749 --> 50:46.168
It heats them up?
So, have some ice cream.

50:46.918 --> 50:49.254
I can't have ice cream
because I'm lactose intolerant.

50:49.337 --> 50:52.758
You guys are full of problems.
I can't believe that this is...

50:52.841 --> 50:55.469
Oh, Mrs. and Mrs. Nature here--

50:55.719 --> 50:59.389
"Oh, we can't eat this,
we don't like that. Garlic is terrible."

50:59.473 --> 51:01.892
I've never heard
of such a thing from farmers.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.561
[Phil] And speaking of complaining.

51:04.644 --> 51:07.939
[Skype ringing]

51:08.023 --> 51:08.982
[Helen] Hi.

51:09.066 --> 51:09.900
Oh, hi.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.738
-[Helen] No, that's still low...
-[Max] Wait.

51:15.822 --> 51:17.449
Now you did it all wrong.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.496
We've got this down to a science,
haven't we?

51:22.579 --> 51:24.623
Oh, now it's too loud.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.958
Now I hear the echo.

51:27.042 --> 51:30.253
-[Max] How are you enjoying--
-[Helen] He gets an echo.

51:30.337 --> 51:33.090
[laughs]

51:33.173 --> 51:35.675
He's turning you off altogether now.

51:35.759 --> 51:38.303
-[Max] Okay.
-That's-- Probably the rest of the world

51:38.386 --> 51:39.721
is doing that as we speak.

51:41.014 --> 51:42.849
Now. How is it now?

51:43.266 --> 51:45.811
It's good. Now it's good.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.230
Philip, how do you like Cape Town?

51:48.772 --> 51:49.606
Boy, it's beautiful.

51:49.689 --> 51:55.737
This city has these giant beautiful
mountains very close to the ocean.

51:55.821 --> 52:00.117
And the city, like, just kind of
filled in between the mountains.

52:00.283 --> 52:02.244
And I fed the ducks in the park.

52:02.327 --> 52:05.247
I've decided I'm going
to be an old man who feeds ducks.

52:05.330 --> 52:06.373
I'm gonna start now.

52:07.415 --> 52:09.584
Well, it suits you very well.

52:09.668 --> 52:10.919
[laughs]

52:11.002 --> 52:13.380
[both laugh]

52:13.463 --> 52:16.299
You know they eat
cuts of meat that we don't have...

52:16.716 --> 52:20.053
like the kinds of meat
you only see on nature shows.

52:20.137 --> 52:23.348
-Like impala.
-Oh, my God.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.474
They're so beautiful.

52:24.558 --> 52:25.559
Sorry.

52:25.892 --> 52:28.270
Then there's kudu.

52:28.353 --> 52:29.563
You can say sorry?

52:31.022 --> 52:34.151
Listen, do you want to stop eating
all animals? Then you can do that.

52:34.442 --> 52:37.112
-But we can't be--
-Impalas are so beautiful.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.239
So are the chickens.

52:39.322 --> 52:40.407
[Phil laughs]

52:44.494 --> 52:45.954
[both laugh]

52:46.037 --> 52:48.373
You hit it, Dad. Dad is right.

52:48.456 --> 52:50.000
What are you doing for your birthday?

52:51.042 --> 52:54.880
-We're going out to this Mirabelle.
-[Phil] Yes.

52:54.963 --> 52:57.132
That was the place
for your 60th anniversary.

52:57.215 --> 53:01.511
We had our-- Yes, over 60 years now.

53:01.595 --> 53:02.804
What is?

53:04.014 --> 53:05.056
Our anniversary.

53:05.140 --> 53:06.850
Oh. Well...

53:06.933 --> 53:07.893
[Phil laughs]

53:10.145 --> 53:11.188
Perfect.

53:11.938 --> 53:13.148
Goodbye, everybody.

53:13.481 --> 53:14.441
[Helen] Bye-bye.

53:14.524 --> 53:15.901
-Bye.
-[Max] Take care.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.529
[Phil] Years after the end of Apartheid,

53:19.613 --> 53:23.074
South Africa is still on the journey
of reinventing its society.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.286
But it seems to be moving
in the right direction.

53:27.579 --> 53:29.289
You know, even though I'm in Africa,

53:29.372 --> 53:32.834
I keep thinking of "This land
is your land, this land is my land."

53:34.336 --> 53:36.004
Nature doesn't discriminate.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.216
These are everyone's pleasures in life:

53:39.591 --> 53:43.053
the land, the sea, the sky.

53:43.970 --> 53:45.972
And of course,
the food that comes from it.

53:48.183 --> 53:50.852
It's how we enjoy it, how we live in it,

53:51.102 --> 53:52.604
eat it, dance it...

53:53.188 --> 53:56.274
how we enjoy each other
that makes life worth living.

53:59.861 --> 54:01.738
