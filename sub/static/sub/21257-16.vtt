WEBVTT

00:07.108 --> 00:08.076
(laughter)

00:08.109 --> 00:11.045
Oh, Melinda,
spectacular job.

00:11.079 --> 00:15.249
Dare I say, we've never
had a fountain unveiling

00:15.283 --> 00:18.352
go off as
smoothly as this.

00:18.386 --> 00:23.357
And your design,
it's original, yet classic.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.658
Gil... (laughs)

00:24.692 --> 00:26.060
Adam, how does it feel to be

00:26.094 --> 00:28.362
on the arm of the future
of fountains?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.231
I've never been happier.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.933
In fact, I've never had a single
doubt about our relationship.

00:32.966 --> 00:36.036
Oh, do I hear wedding
fountains in your future?

00:36.070 --> 00:38.439
Gil, stop trying
to predict the future.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.740
It's not possible.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.942
Well, if I were
in Adam's loafers,

00:41.975 --> 00:43.577
I would be looking
for rings.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.045
Yeah, if I could forget
everything I know

00:45.079 --> 00:47.415
about the diamond industry.
The truth about rings is that--

00:47.448 --> 00:49.250
Please don't ruin
anything tonight.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.884
Of course.

00:50.918 --> 00:55.223
Francois, shut off Melinda's
masterpiece, please.

00:55.256 --> 01:00.561
You don't want to deplete all
the company's liquid assets.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.630
(laughing)

01:02.663 --> 01:05.099
(Melinda)
Very funny.
So funny.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.534
It was good.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.701
Fountain humor!

01:07.735 --> 01:09.137
Are you okay?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.271
Of course.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.772
My voice always
sounds this strained

01:11.805 --> 01:13.641
when I'm confident
about my choices.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.644
Adam, maybe we should have
a conversation about our future.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.079
You've been acting strange
ever since our argument

01:19.113 --> 01:21.215
about the moon landing
and it's just...

01:21.249 --> 01:24.452
I know sometimes relationships
have expiration dates, so...

01:24.485 --> 01:26.454
**

01:26.487 --> 01:27.821
Funny you should say
expiration dates,

01:27.855 --> 01:29.790
because the expiration
dates on food

01:29.823 --> 01:31.625
don't mean what
you think they do.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.461
Are you seriously starting
a show right now?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.429
Yeah, it seems like
the right time.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.797
Hi, I'm Adam Conover,

01:36.830 --> 01:38.932
and this
is "Adam Ruin Everything."

01:50.144 --> 01:52.246
Okay, Adam, if you're
sure there's nothing

01:52.280 --> 01:53.647
you want to talk about,

01:53.681 --> 01:55.349
then I guess I'll just help
the caterers clean up

01:55.383 --> 01:56.717
so we can get out of here.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.521
What the...

02:00.554 --> 02:02.923
Eggs, sell by yesterday?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.692
Orange juice,
best by two days ago?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.594
Yogurt, use by last week?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.629
Well, now I have to get
rid of all this food.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.364
If I don't,
someone could get sick.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.832
No, you don't.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.268
Best by, use by, sell by.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.669
Contrary to popular belief,

02:15.703 --> 02:17.705
none of these dates
actually tells you

02:17.738 --> 02:19.873
when food stops
being safe to eat.

02:19.907 --> 02:23.344
In fact, food can still be good
way past the date on the label.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.379
According to food
safety experts,

02:25.413 --> 02:27.381
eggs can be eaten three
to five weeks

02:27.415 --> 02:29.183
past the sell-by date.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.352
Sell-by dates are a yolk!

02:31.385 --> 02:33.787
And the USDA says canned
and dried foods

02:33.821 --> 02:35.289
can be safe indefinitely.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.724
Ho-ho-ho!

02:36.757 --> 02:38.959
I won't go bad
for years!

02:38.992 --> 02:41.128
And if food isn't
handled properly,

02:41.161 --> 02:42.363
it can actually go bad

02:42.396 --> 02:44.031
before the date
on the label.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.234
Even something as simple as
leaving it out on the counter

02:46.267 --> 02:48.869
too long or setting your fridge
at the wrong temperature

02:48.902 --> 02:50.371
can cut shelf life short.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.740
It's so hot in here.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.342
I think I'm...

02:54.375 --> 02:56.176
I'm going bad.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.178
Oh, yeah!

02:58.212 --> 02:59.547
At the end of the day,

02:59.580 --> 03:02.049
these dates just
don't tell you that much.

03:02.082 --> 03:05.519
Instead, you need to check your
food for signs of spoilage,

03:05.553 --> 03:08.556
like changes in smell,
color or texture.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.890
Ugh, woof!

03:09.923 --> 03:12.092
Okay, well, then this milk
is definitely bad.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.428
Nope.
You can still
drink me.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.429
Oh, yeah.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.064
Milk is a really
neat exception.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.532
Even after it spoils,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.734
it's still totally safe
to drink.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.735
Oh, ew, stop!

03:21.769 --> 03:23.003
You're gonna get sick.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.004
Nope.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.406
Milk is pasteurized,

03:25.439 --> 03:27.875
which means any harmful
bacteria was removed

03:27.908 --> 03:31.445
long before it hit
the shelves.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.848
Even though it might
not taste great,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.584
the safety risk
of drinking spoiled milk

03:36.617 --> 03:38.286
are virtually zero.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.754
Adam, stop.
I get it, I get it.

03:40.788 --> 03:44.091
But if the date doesn't
say when the food's safe to eat,

03:44.124 --> 03:46.059
why does the federal government
put it there?

03:46.093 --> 03:48.429
Hate to break it to you.
They don't.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.264
We all assume
that these labels

03:50.298 --> 03:53.100
are some kinda big government
safety regulation,

03:53.133 --> 03:55.102
but with the exception
of baby food,

03:55.135 --> 03:57.771
the federal government actually
doesn't require date labeling

03:57.805 --> 03:59.440
of any kind.

03:59.473 --> 04:03.143
The citizens of this great
nation have the inalienable

04:03.176 --> 04:06.980
right to eat five-year-old
mayonnaise if they want,

04:07.014 --> 04:09.650
for this is...

04:09.683 --> 04:11.051
ew...
America.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.054
Instead, it's all left up
to the states,

04:14.087 --> 04:16.457
and every state has
their own rules.

04:16.490 --> 04:21.094
In fact, nine states
have no date labeling
regulations at all.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.896
Well, who does put
the dates on the food?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.598
Seems like they don't
tell us anything at all.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.434
Oh, no, they do
tell you one thing:

04:26.467 --> 04:29.470
when the manufacturer thinks
their food tastes the best.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.805
What?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.975
Here at Hulko, we use
cutting-edge food science

04:35.008 --> 04:38.312
to determine the exact best by
and use by date

04:38.346 --> 04:41.014
at which our food is
the most snacktabulous.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.484
Mmm.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.486
It's still pretty good.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.120
Pretty good garbage,
you mean.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.689
Date it, boys.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.292
But that food's
not dangerous.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.662
And he just said it
still tasted good.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.330
Not good enough!

04:56.364 --> 04:59.433
We need our customers eating
our food at maximum crunchitude

04:59.467 --> 05:01.502
or they might buy
something else!

05:01.535 --> 05:04.137
And hey, if they think they
have to throw it away sooner

05:04.171 --> 05:05.939
and buy more...

05:05.973 --> 05:08.141
But that's wasting food.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.611
That's right, Melinda,
and it's a major problem.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.046
Melinda, this
is Dana Gunders.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.349
She's a senior scientist
at the natural resources

05:15.383 --> 05:16.984
defense council
and a co-author

05:17.017 --> 05:19.186
of a major 2013
Harvard report

05:19.219 --> 05:21.689
detailing the massive
problem with these dates.

05:21.722 --> 05:26.193
Americans trash over 160 billion
pounds of perfectly good food

05:26.226 --> 05:27.661
every year.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.831
Roughly 40% of our
food supply is thrown out,

05:30.864 --> 05:33.801
and thee confusing dates
are a huge factor.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.505
One survey found that 83%
of Americans have prematurely

05:37.538 --> 05:40.207
thrown out food based on
the sell-by date,

05:40.240 --> 05:42.876
but that date isn't even
meant for consumers.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.979
It just tells stores when
to turn over their inventory.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.081
Wait, sell by today?

05:48.115 --> 05:50.050
But I bought this today.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.752
Oh, well.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.086
This is ridiculous.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.722
Someone should do something.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.056
Well, some leaders
in the grocery industry

05:56.089 --> 05:58.559
are pushing for clearer,
simpler labels,

05:58.592 --> 06:01.161
but until there's a nationally
mandated system,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.431
their recommendations
are just voluntary.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.399
And the worst part is,
we're trashing

06:05.433 --> 06:10.070
all this perfectly good food
while millions are going hungry.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.906
Whoa.
That one's alive.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.575
All this has got to go.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.909
(Dana)
No, I'm still good!

06:15.943 --> 06:18.746
I've got to stop this.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.080
Hey!

06:20.113 --> 06:21.415
Give me that cheese.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.783
It's pasteurized!

06:26.420 --> 06:27.755
Yeah.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.923
I'm glad we're not giving up
on this cheese too early,

06:29.957 --> 06:32.626
'cause it could last a lot
longer than we think,

06:32.660 --> 06:33.761
and maybe the cheese
is just going through

06:33.794 --> 06:34.928
a rough patch right now.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.530
Wait, what?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.198
Well, like, back
when I didn't have cheese,

06:38.231 --> 06:40.200
I wanted cheese
so bad.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.069
And just because the cheese
I have now isn't the cheese

06:42.102 --> 06:43.303
I thought it would be,
that doesn't mean

06:43.336 --> 06:45.072
we should throw it out.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.941
Maybe it's the kind of cheese
that gets better with time.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.543
It really sounds
like you're talking

06:49.577 --> 06:52.446
about a lot more
than cheese here.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.747
Are you sure you don't want
to have that conversation

06:53.781 --> 06:55.382
about our future?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.284
The future?

06:57.317 --> 07:01.254
Uh, well... the thing
about the future is...

07:01.288 --> 07:03.624
In the future, you'll be
miserable, 'cause you probably

07:03.657 --> 07:06.293
won't be able to retire
on your 401(k).

07:06.326 --> 07:08.028
Just what I wanted
to talk about.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.734
Whee! Drinking all
that old milk made my hyphy!

07:13.767 --> 07:14.802
Ha-ha!

07:14.835 --> 07:16.804
So instead of talking
about our relationship,

07:16.837 --> 07:18.906
now you want to
ruin 401(k)s?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.307
Yep.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.409
Well, I don't see
what there is to ruin.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.244
Putting money in a 401(k)

07:24.277 --> 07:26.013
is the most responsible
financial decision

07:26.046 --> 07:27.014
I've ever made.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.149
I contribute 5%
of every paycheck,

07:29.182 --> 07:30.250
my company matches it

07:30.283 --> 07:32.653
and I get to choose
all my own investments.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.022
By the time I'm 65,
I'll be set.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.925
Yeah, that's what they tell you,
but it's not true.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.495
Not only are 401(k)s a lot
riskier than you think,

07:41.529 --> 07:43.363
when it comes to securing
your future,

07:43.396 --> 07:45.265
they are woefully
inadequate.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.601
In the old days,
if a company
had a retirement plan,

07:47.635 --> 07:49.369
it was a pension.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.639
So I break my back
in your mine for 30 years

07:51.672 --> 07:54.041
and then you give me a check
every week until I die?

07:54.074 --> 07:56.510
Gee, Mister,
that's swell.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.778
For workers
that had pensions,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.680
this was actually
a pretty great deal,

07:59.713 --> 08:02.516
but in the '80s and '90s,
more and more companies started

08:02.550 --> 08:06.186
switching to 401(k)s,
a shiny new financial product

08:06.219 --> 08:08.188
that gave workers
an incentive to save more

08:08.221 --> 08:10.658
of their own money
for retirement.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.360
Pensions are your dad's
retirement plan.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.796
Try this 401(k).

08:15.829 --> 08:18.298
Whoa, so I just put aside
a little bit of my paycheck

08:18.331 --> 08:21.702
into an investment account,
tax free, and then you match it?

08:21.735 --> 08:23.136
And unlike a pension,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.806
I can take my 401(k)
with me from job to job?

08:25.839 --> 08:30.010
That freedom is perfect
for my active '90's lifestyle.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.713
But that freedom
was a bit oversold.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.148
401(k)s have tons
of hidden fees,

08:35.182 --> 08:37.718
and it's pretty easy
to make a bad investment.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.353
Here, just pick
some stocks.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.590
Wow, Blockbuster,
Enron!

08:42.623 --> 08:43.691
Pets.com!

08:43.724 --> 08:46.093
I love that sock puppet!

08:46.126 --> 08:48.061
Well, if people
don't bother to learn

08:48.095 --> 08:50.731
how to set up their 401(k),
that's on them.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.533
If you do it right, you can
guarantee your own retirement.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.035
No, you can't.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.571
Because the biggest problem
with 401(k)s

08:57.605 --> 08:59.673
is that they put
all the risk on you,

08:59.707 --> 09:01.709
and the one thing
you can't guarantee

09:01.742 --> 09:03.911
is the stock
and bond market.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.714
We learned how big that risk
is during the recessions

09:06.747 --> 09:09.950
of the 2000s, starting
when the dotcom bubble burst.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.588
My Pets.com stock!
That puppet lied to me!

09:14.622 --> 09:19.059
And especially during
the 2008 financial crisis.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.261
Okay, 2000 was rough,

09:21.294 --> 09:25.032
but now it's 2008
and yes, we can...

09:25.065 --> 09:27.400
keep working here, I guess.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.070
People on the brink
of retiring were screwed,

09:30.103 --> 09:32.572
even if they had
done everything right.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.141
But that was years ago.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.611
The economy recovered,
so my 401(k) will be fine.
Right?

09:37.645 --> 09:39.412
Sorry, lady.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.081
You're gonna have to save
a lot more than you thought.

09:41.114 --> 09:45.285
Okay, well, I contribute 5%
of my paycheck right now.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.887
What if I upped it to six?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.488
Not good enough.

09:48.521 --> 09:52.059
Experts say you should save
at least ten or even 15%.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.127
15%?

09:54.161 --> 09:55.929
That's more than
I spend on groceries.

09:55.963 --> 09:56.897
I can't afford that.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.766
Yeah, and you're
not alone.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.401
With stagnant wages
and the skyrocketing costs

10:01.434 --> 10:05.272
of healthcare, childcare
and college, 52% of American

10:05.305 --> 10:07.407
households are at risk of not
having enough money to maintain

10:07.440 --> 10:08.842
their standard
of living

10:08.876 --> 10:10.143
when they retire.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.413
And nearly half
of Americans ages 32 to 61

10:13.446 --> 10:16.483
have no
retirement
savings at all.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.418
Looks like you're gonna have
roommates in your seventies.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.787
(snorts)

10:19.820 --> 10:21.321
Okay, forget 401(k)s.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.656
What should I do instead?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.457
403(b)?
Roth IRA?

10:24.491 --> 10:26.493
Good old-fashioned
mattress fund?

10:26.526 --> 10:29.496
Actually, none of those are
enough on their own.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.665
Melinda,
this is Teresa Ghilarducci.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.333
She's a labor economist
at The New School

10:33.366 --> 10:34.868
who studies
retirement security.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.672
401(k)s were never meant to
replace our pension system.

10:38.706 --> 10:43.276
They were intended to supplement
pensions and social security.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.346
Even social security
only replaces 40%

10:46.379 --> 10:48.548
of what an average worker
needs in retirement.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.484
And this problem
is only getting worse.

10:51.518 --> 10:55.155
10,000 baby boomers
are turning 65 every day

10:55.188 --> 10:56.857
and we have no good plan
in place

10:56.890 --> 10:58.358
for how we're gonna
take care of them.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.993
And instead of making one,

11:00.027 --> 11:02.329
we've just sent
a message to workers

11:02.362 --> 11:05.365
that if you're not prepared
for retirement, it's your fault.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.835
Asking people to be
a retirement expert,

11:07.868 --> 11:09.536
to be an investment expert

11:09.569 --> 11:12.039
is like asking people to do
their own dental work.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.707
Then what do we do?

11:13.741 --> 11:15.809
Well, since we don't
have any better options,

11:15.843 --> 11:19.312
if your employer
offers a 401(k),
then take it.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.349
If they don't,
then open an IRA.

11:22.382 --> 11:26.219
In either case,
only invest in index funds

11:26.253 --> 11:28.055
because they charge
much lower fees.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.489
But in terms
of a bigger picture,

11:29.522 --> 11:30.891
we should all pressure
the government

11:30.924 --> 11:34.594
to set up a well regulated
public private

11:34.627 --> 11:37.064
retirement system like
other countries have.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.332
Until that happens,
your only choice is to save

11:39.366 --> 11:40.433
as much as you can.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.969
Thanks, Teresa.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.438
This is overwhelming
to think about.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.740
I know.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.575
But it's a problem
that we as a nation

11:48.608 --> 11:50.377
have to face head on.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.081
We can't avoid having this
conversation about our future.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.248
Our financial future.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.917
That's the future
I'm talking about.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.185
Other conversations
about the future,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.386
you can avoid forever.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.520
Hopefully.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.522
Adam, look at me.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.927
We can both tell there's
something off here.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.262
Just tell me how you feel.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.865
I don't know how I feel.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.801
I really like spending time
with you,

12:13.834 --> 12:18.471
but I don't know if I'm
as happy as I should be.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.440
You're my first
real girlfriend

12:20.473 --> 12:22.575
and I don't know
if the problem

12:22.609 --> 12:25.612
is us or... me.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.783
If I invest more in our
relationship,

12:29.817 --> 12:32.085
maybe it'll grow
with time.

12:32.119 --> 12:35.322
Or maybe it'll crash,
like Pets.com.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.990
Not really
into this metaphor.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.828
I don't know what to do.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.630
(sighs)
Well...

12:43.663 --> 12:45.132
What do you want to do?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.268
Research!

12:48.301 --> 12:49.269
Oh, no.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.138
If I talk to a ton
of experts

12:51.171 --> 12:53.073
and read every relationship
study I can find,

12:53.106 --> 12:54.908
I'll be able to predict,
for sure,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.309
what our
future will be.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.978
No.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.314
Adam, you can't
predict the future.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.817
And I'm gonna prove
it to you.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.418
The power of knowledge!

13:05.452 --> 13:06.419
Yep.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.855
Hold on to your hair.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.190
This is "Melinda Ruins
Everything."

13:17.998 --> 13:19.299
What is this place?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.501
This is the future.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.003
But I can't see anything.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.304
Exactly.

13:24.337 --> 13:28.041
We can't know
what the future holds.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.843
Man, these powers
are cool.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.544
It's fun
being the Adam.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.847
But you can't ruin
predicting the future!

13:33.881 --> 13:35.348
People have done it
throughout history.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.683
They have.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.619
But usually, their judgments
are too clouded by the present.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.223
Before the car was invented,
19th century sci-fi writers

13:43.256 --> 13:46.894
imagined people would
get around like this.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.863
In the future, man shall
transport himself

13:49.897 --> 13:52.365
upon a steed
of steel!

13:52.399 --> 13:53.666
(horse neighing)

13:53.700 --> 13:56.469
And at the 1964
World's Fair,

13:56.503 --> 14:00.207
IBM passed over their computers
to showcase what they thought

14:00.240 --> 14:03.376
would be the truly revolutionary
modern technology.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.545
The electric typewriter!

14:05.578 --> 14:07.847
Forget about those oversized
adding machines.

14:07.881 --> 14:12.519
The future is typing
at a slightly faster speed.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.488
Even today, you should be
skeptical of any tech company

14:15.522 --> 14:17.724
that makes big promises
about the future.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.159
Remember Google Glass?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.028
In 2012,
Google hyped it up

14:21.061 --> 14:22.930
before they had even
finished testing it.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.864
They lined up celebrity
endorsements,

14:24.898 --> 14:28.401
a Time Magazine profile,
even a 12-page spread in Vogue.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.438
But in the real world, people
hated those dumb nerd goggles.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.107
Is this how
ugly people feel?

14:34.141 --> 14:35.375
(huffs)

14:35.408 --> 14:36.876
Okay, well, maybe
we can't always call

14:36.910 --> 14:39.846
the next big tech thing,
but what about my future?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.214
I should be able
to predict that.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.716
No, you can't.
And here's why.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.086
There's psychological research
that shows that when we try

14:46.119 --> 14:47.220
to imagine our future,

14:47.254 --> 14:49.556
we only picture
a couple of details.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.025
Ugh, I just know
I'm gonna hate this party.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.760
I'll have to meet
a bunch of people.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.195
And talk to them
about stuff.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.596
But there are thousands
of factors

14:56.629 --> 14:58.431
that could change how
you feel about the future

14:58.465 --> 15:00.067
once you reach it,
and you can't possibly

15:00.100 --> 15:01.268
predict them all.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.470
Wait, all my friends
are here?

15:03.503 --> 15:04.972
And I'm drunk?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.373
And there's a dog!

15:06.406 --> 15:07.607
Hell, yeah.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.110
I never imagined
this party would be fun.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.611
So as much as you
want to know

15:11.644 --> 15:14.314
exactly where our
relationship's gonna go,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.916
there are countless potential
futures ahead of us.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.653
Even our personalities
change over time.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.754
No, no, no.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.124
I couldn't change
my personality if I tried.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.325
And I have tried.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.893
People have asked me to.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.895
Sorry, it happens
to all of us,

15:28.928 --> 15:30.964
even if we can't
imagine it.

15:30.998 --> 15:34.801
In one study, researchers
compared how much people

15:34.834 --> 15:36.069
believed they'd changed

15:36.103 --> 15:38.105
in the last ten years
to how much they

15:38.138 --> 15:40.673
predicted they were gonna
change in the next ten years.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.443
I was completely different
when I was a kid.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.278
I used to listen to ska.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.947
But even though, like, him,
most people believed they were

15:47.981 --> 15:49.316
different in the past,

15:49.349 --> 15:50.817
they still didn't
think they would change much

15:50.850 --> 15:51.985
in the future.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
This is who
I'll be forever.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.523
Punk will never die.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.158
Ha!
Believe me.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.692
Punk dies, kid.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.161
And it wasn't just
the young'uns.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.197
Older participants showed
the exact same pattern.

16:04.231 --> 16:08.168
I'll be doing Jager bombs
with my finance bros 'til I die!

16:08.201 --> 16:09.536
Ugh.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.205
Believe me,
your bros die, kid.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.507
Somewhere around
the 20th shot.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.977
We seriously underestimate
how much and in what ways

16:18.011 --> 16:19.679
we're gonna grow and evolve.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.014
That's why we're
so bad at predicting

16:21.048 --> 16:22.382
how we'll feel in the future.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.485
But if I can't know for sure
how I'm gonna feel,

16:25.518 --> 16:27.687
how can I make
decisions about anything?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.157
No. I need to do
more research.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.691
Adam, you know there
are some problems

16:31.724 --> 16:34.827
that you can't
research away, right?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.063
Yeah.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.730
I've learned that.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.134
Well, then you should know
that it's okay not to know.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.204
Honestly, I'm not sure about
our future right now, either.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.806
These past couple months
have been fun,

16:46.839 --> 16:48.475
but they've
been hard, too.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.379
So how do we decide
what to do now?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.248
Well, you can use another person
who's had a similar experience

16:55.282 --> 16:56.516
as your guide.

16:56.549 --> 17:00.253
It's a psychological method
called surrogation.

17:00.287 --> 17:03.090
In one experiment, researchers
told speed daters they could

17:03.123 --> 17:06.726
find out all about their date,
likes, dislikes, photos,

17:06.759 --> 17:10.697
or get a rating from a woman who
had already gone out with him,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.999
then the researchers
asked the women to predict

17:13.032 --> 17:14.867
how much they'd
enjoy the date.

17:14.901 --> 17:17.437
It turned out, the women who had
gotten someone else's opinion

17:17.470 --> 17:19.572
made better predictions
than the women

17:19.606 --> 17:21.541
who had done
their own research.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.009
What happened?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.745
I checked your Facebook,
Instagram, LinkedIn.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.380
I thought I'd love you.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.218
Yeah, Eliza told me
you'd be an F.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.452
Minus.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.753
Huh.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.689
You can't predict exactly how
things are gonna turn out.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.592
You just have to follow your
heart and make a decision.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.428
But if you want a better idea

17:41.461 --> 17:43.863
of how that decision
might make you feel,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.898
ask someone who's
been there before.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.467
Phone a friend.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.105
(cell phone ringing)

17:52.139 --> 17:53.406
(scoffs)

17:53.440 --> 17:55.442
This mother falcon.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.747
Adam, where are you?!

18:00.780 --> 18:03.783
You can't just Mary Poppins
away and never call.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.952
I mean, I thought you got
sucked up by a jet engine.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.254
No, I'm fine.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.721
I've been
with my girlfriend.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.459
Well, I find that hard
to believe, but continue.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.660
I thought being
in a relationship

18:13.693 --> 18:17.297
would make me happy
or complete.

18:17.330 --> 18:21.968
And she's great,
but something's still missing,

18:22.001 --> 18:24.437
and now I don't
know what to do.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.972
Have you ever felt
that way?

18:26.005 --> 18:31.077
Adam, when I first started
dating, I was really insecure.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.845
I mean, I would just jump
into a relationship

18:32.879 --> 18:34.614
with anyone who
said they liked me,

18:34.647 --> 18:37.184
as though if I didn't
have someone else's approval,

18:37.217 --> 18:39.452
that meant there
was something...

18:39.486 --> 18:40.587
wrong with me.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.291
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.826
I wonder if that's
why I ruin things, too.

18:46.859 --> 18:50.029
I mean, I'm not a therapist,
but, like, yeah, fo' sho.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.265
But eventually,
I realized,

18:52.299 --> 18:56.269
I was actually fine,
all by myself.

18:56.303 --> 19:01.308
I just needed to learn
how to be okay with who I was.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.676
And no one else
was gonna do that for me.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.813
That is something that I had to
learn how to do on my own.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.848
Which took time.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.652
But if there's one thing
I know about Adam Conover,

19:12.685 --> 19:18.124
it's that he always has time
to learn something new.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.960
Besides, you probably only think
you need to be in a relationship

19:20.993 --> 19:23.530
because of some old dude's
marketing campaign.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.997
(laughs)
Yeah.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.133
He was probably really
into eugenics, too.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.501
(laughing)

19:30.036 --> 19:31.170
Thanks, Em.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.742
I think we should break up.
I think we should break up.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.876
Wait...

19:36.909 --> 19:37.877
You do?

19:37.910 --> 19:39.679
Yeah.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.815
There are a lot of things
I really like about you,

19:42.849 --> 19:45.985
but I don't think we're
right for each other.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.155
I think you
are the most amazing person,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.658
and you've taught me
so much.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.761
But I have some things
I need to figure out on my own.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.602
It really is incredible,
Melinda.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.704
Thanks.

20:04.737 --> 20:08.575
You know, even though our future
didn't turn out like I thought,

20:08.608 --> 20:10.109
I think we're both
gonna be okay.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.746
Me too.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.482
Goodbye, Adam.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.353
Hey.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.455
Can you, like, magic
your stuff out of my house?

20:22.489 --> 20:23.723
Of course.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.661
**

20:33.266 --> 20:36.168
**

20:38.971 --> 20:41.474
You know, cell phones
cause cancer.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.112
And microwaves
make you infertile.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.414
Read it on Facebook.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.251
If you think I'm wrong,
speak now,

20:52.285 --> 20:55.087
or I'm gonna believe
that forever.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.657
I'm okay.
Thanks, though.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.961
Huh.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.897
Some people just don't
want to know the truth.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.999
(deep inhale)

21:08.668 --> 21:11.404
**

21:11.438 --> 21:12.772
Hello, everyone.
I'm here behind the scenes

21:12.805 --> 21:15.174
on "Adam Ruin Everything"
with Teresa Ghilarducci.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.609
Thanks for being here
on the show.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.311
I'm really glad
to be here, thank you.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.746
If you could put it
in a nutshell,

21:19.779 --> 21:22.582
what is the problem with how
America handles retirement?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.652
Well, for the past 37 years,
we've had an experiment,

21:25.685 --> 21:28.655
and that experiment has been
with 401(k)s or what I call

21:28.688 --> 21:32.359
a do-it-yourself retirement
system, and it's failed.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.495
We don't have a system designed
for the human beings

21:35.528 --> 21:36.963
that we have or designed

21:36.996 --> 21:39.632
for the kinds
of labor market we have.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.969
We're not robots and we don't
have our jobs for our whole life

21:43.002 --> 21:46.305
and we don't start saving
when we first start our jobs.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.641
What I say to people is,

21:48.675 --> 21:51.310
don't give up
if you're 50 and you

21:51.344 --> 21:54.481
don't have any savings,
save as much as you can,

21:54.514 --> 21:58.017
but I also tell people to kind
of cut their expectations,

21:58.050 --> 22:02.054
to cut their living standards
by 20 or 30%.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.890
But I--
That's a tough thing
to tell people.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.625
Yeah, my heart breaks
when I do.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.993
Well, so what do you say--

22:07.026 --> 22:09.662
I'm sure a lot of Americans say,
hey, I like that it's voluntary.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.664
I like that I decide
what to do with my money,

22:11.698 --> 22:13.666
and so it's up to that
individual person.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.835
I mean, a lot of people
feel that as an ethos

22:15.868 --> 22:16.836
and that's
important to them.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.204
What do you say
to those folks?

22:18.237 --> 22:20.840
You know, if you ask people
whether or not it should be

22:20.873 --> 22:23.910
a voluntary system, they say
yeah, it should be voluntary,

22:23.943 --> 22:26.012
but if you actually
tell them

22:26.045 --> 22:27.514
that we've had
that experiment,

22:27.547 --> 22:30.850
that voluntary experiment
for the past 40 years

22:30.883 --> 22:32.351
and that half
of Americans

22:32.385 --> 22:35.321
are going to end up being
downwardly mobile

22:35.354 --> 22:36.689
when they retire,

22:36.723 --> 22:39.659
they'll move from being
a middle class worker

22:39.692 --> 22:42.161
to a poor
or near-poor retiree,

22:42.194 --> 22:44.330
they have second
thoughts about it,

22:44.363 --> 22:48.901
and they say, boy, I wish
someone told me to save.

22:48.935 --> 22:52.204
But people do tell us
to save and yet we don't.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.107
Yeah, it's not just
about telling to save,

22:55.141 --> 22:57.176
it's about making
them save.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.347
There's a lot of ideas out there
to provide a mandatory layer

23:01.380 --> 23:03.049
on top of social security.

23:03.082 --> 23:07.454
I mean, lots of people in this
country have a mandatory layer.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.789
It's the unionized plumber,

23:09.822 --> 23:11.958
it's the worker
at the auto plant,

23:11.991 --> 23:14.060
it's the teacher
at the university.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.128
It's the cop on the beat.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.565
Right.
They all have
a mandatory system,

23:18.598 --> 23:20.633
so it's not un-American

23:20.667 --> 23:24.070
to have a layer of pensions

23:24.103 --> 23:26.539
that is advance funded
and get their returns

23:26.573 --> 23:28.741
from the finance market.
We just need to get
more people in those programs.

23:28.775 --> 23:29.909
Yeah, we need to get
more people in it,

23:29.942 --> 23:32.745
but to have a system
that gets everybody

23:32.779 --> 23:37.249
to a place where they maintain
their living standards

23:37.283 --> 23:40.319
is what you would expect
from a functioning nation.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.154
Yeah.
And we've told people,

23:42.188 --> 23:44.090
we've tortured them
in fourth grade

23:44.123 --> 23:47.794
with the idea of having to save,
but it hasn't worked,

23:47.827 --> 23:49.996
and in every other country

23:50.029 --> 23:52.799
that's experimented
with a voluntary system,

23:52.832 --> 23:55.001
it covers about half
the population.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.069
Like ours does.
That's right.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.640
And it's not people's fault,
it's the environment's fault.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.743
We have not designed
a good system.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.012
We don't have
flawed human beings.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.313
We have a flawed system.

24:07.346 --> 24:10.583
It's like, we need a good
healthcare system,

24:10.617 --> 24:12.952
but we also need people
to take care of themselves

24:12.985 --> 24:14.921
and not smoke and not
eat too much.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.956
That's something we talk about
so much on this show,

24:16.989 --> 24:19.125
is the interaction of that
individual responsibility

24:19.158 --> 24:22.161
in action with the system,
and both need to work.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.831
We need-- We need people
who are gonna take
responsibility for themselves

24:24.864 --> 24:27.266
and we need a system that
supports them and helps them

24:27.299 --> 24:30.803
make those choices and supports
them in making the best choices.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.839
And that's totally American.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.173
Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show

24:34.206 --> 24:35.307
to talk to us
about this, Teresa.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.475
Thanks, Adam.
It's really been wonderful.
