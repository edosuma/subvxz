WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:05.802
Solar flare activity has
increased across space lanes 556

00:05.881 --> 00:08.134
and all commercial flights
are advised...

00:27.236 --> 00:30.911
So, it's 200,000, it's a spaceship...
No, wait a minute, space station.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.036
And, er...

00:32.115 --> 00:33.708
Go try that gate over there!
Off you go.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.161
- 200,000? Right.
- 200,000.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.963
Adam! Out you come.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.134
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.762
- Where are we?
- Good question.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.386
Let's see. So, um...

00:48.465 --> 00:51.890
judging by the architecture,
I'd say we're around the year 200,000.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.063
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- And if you listen...

00:54.137 --> 00:55.605
Engines.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.729
We're on some sort
of space station.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.068
Yeah, definitely
a space station.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.925
It's a bit warm in here,
they could turn the heating down.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.817
Tell you what,
let's try that gate. Come on.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.538
Here we go.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.332
And this is...

01:21.832 --> 01:23.584
I'll let the Doctor
describe it.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.468
The Fourth Great and Bountiful
Human Empire. And there it is.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.390
Planet Earth, at its height.

01:31.466 --> 01:36.142
Covered with mega-cities, five
moons, population 96 billion,

01:36.388 --> 01:40.438
the hub of a galactic domain
stretching across a million planets,

01:40.601 --> 01:44.401
a million species,
with mankind right in the middle.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.071
He's your boyfriend.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.862
Not anymore.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.703
Come on, Adam,
open your mind. You're gonna like this

02:36.782 --> 02:40.127
fantastic period of history,
the human race at its most intelligent.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.745
Culture! Art! Politics!

02:41.828 --> 02:43.751
This era has got fine food,
good manners, the works...

02:43.830 --> 02:44.831
Out the way!

02:44.915 --> 02:48.215
Let's get to it.
Thank you very much, indeed.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.672
Somebody there? That's right. What do
you want, love? Keep it moving.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.554
- I'll be with you lot in a minute. Here you are.
- One at a time!

02:56.885 --> 03:00.856
Now what was it? Kronkburger with
cheese, kronkburger with pajatos.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.943
Oi! You, mate! Stop pushing.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.939
Get back! I said back!

03:08.063 --> 03:11.283
- Fine cuisine?
- My watch must be wrong.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.360
No, it's fine. That's weird.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.723
That's what comes of showing off. Your
history's not as good as you thought it was.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.706
- My history is perfect.
- Well, obviously not.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.001
They're all human. What
about the millions of planets,

03:21.118 --> 03:22.711
millions of species,
where are they?

03:22.786 --> 03:25.289
Good question.
Actually, that is a good question.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.000
Adam, me old mate,
you must be starving!

03:28.125 --> 03:29.422
No, I'm just a bit timesick.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.129
You just need grub.
Oi, mate! How much is a kronkburger?

03:32.212 --> 03:35.307
Two credits twenty,
sweetheart. Now, join the queue!

03:35.757 --> 03:37.179
Money! We need money.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.802
Let's use a cash point.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.220
There you go, pocket money.
Don't spend it all on sweets.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.945
Well, how does it work?

03:53.024 --> 03:55.152
Go and find out,
stop nagging me!

03:55.444 --> 03:58.072
The thing is, Adam,
time travel's like visiting Paris.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.157
You can't just read
the guidebook, you gotta throw yourself in.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.561
Eat the food,
use the wrong verbs,

04:01.616 --> 04:03.869
get charged double
and end up kissing complete strangers.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.166
Or is that just me?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.669
Stop asking questions,
go and do it!

04:08.832 --> 04:11.005
Off you go, then.
Your first date.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.257
You're gonna get a smack,
you are!

04:18.716 --> 04:21.516
Um, this is gonna sound daft,
but can you tell me where I am?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.355
Floor 139.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.521
- Could they write it any bigger?
- Floor 139 of what?

04:26.892 --> 04:28.360
Must have been a hell
of a party.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.109
- Are you on Satellite Five?
- What's Satellite Five?

04:32.022 --> 04:34.275
Come on, how could you
get on board without knowing where you are?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.483
Look at me, I'm stupid.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.494
Hold on, wait a minute.
Are you a test?

04:38.111 --> 04:41.035
- Some sort of management test kind of thing?
- You've got me.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.458
Well done.
You're too clever for me.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.999
We were warned about this
in basic training.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.881
All workers have to be versed
in company promotion.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.214
Right, fire away,
ask your questions.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.425
If it gets me to Floor
500, I'll do anything.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.051
Why? What happens
on Floor 500?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.557
The walls are made of gold.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.346
And you should know,
Mr Management.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.557
So, this is what we do.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.071
Latest news.
Sandstorms on the New Venus Archipelago,

05:13.146 --> 05:14.489
200 dead.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.492
Glasgow water riots
into their third day.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.325
Space lane 77 closed
by sunspot activity.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.826
And over on the Bad Wolf channel, the Face
of Boe has just announced he's pregnant.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.626
I get it.
You broadcast the news.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.080
We are the news.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.751
We're the journalists.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.375
We write it, package
it and sell it.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.922
600 channels, all coming out
of Satellite Five, broadcasting everywhere.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.474
Something

05:42.592 --> 05:43.718
is wrong.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.356
Something fictional.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.361
Those people.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.407
Nothing happens in the whole Human
Empire without it going through us.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.446
Security check.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.615
Go deep.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.289
All staff are reminded
that the canteen area

06:05.365 --> 06:08.710
now operates a
self-cleaning table system. Thank you.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.128
Try this, it's called Zaffic.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.457
It's nice, like, um,
a Slush Puppy.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.132
What flavour?

06:18.503 --> 06:19.675
It's sort of beef.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.093
Oh, my God!

06:24.426 --> 06:26.053
It's like everything's gone.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.854
Home, family...

06:27.929 --> 06:29.431
Everything.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.604
This helps.
The Doctor gave it a bit of a top-up.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.063
Who's back home,
your mum and dad?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.651
Yeah.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.940
Phone them up.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.194
But that's 198,000 years ago.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.413
Honestly, try it.
Go on.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.498
- Is there a code for planet Earth?
- Just dial!

06:56.249 --> 06:57.421
I'm sorry we 're not in.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.628
- It's her.
- Please leave a message. Thanks, bye!

07:01.212 --> 07:02.509
Hi!

07:02.631 --> 07:03.848
It... It's me.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.933
I've son' of gone travelling.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.813
I met these people,
and we 're travelling together.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.445
But, um, I'm fine.
And I'll call you later.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.356
Love you. Bye.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.698
Oi, Mutt and Jeff! Over here!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.218
Security check cleared.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.091
No, something's wrong.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.132
I can taste it.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.432
A tiny little shift
in the information.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.434
Someone down there
shouldn't be here.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.443
Double check. Triple check.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.691
Follow them.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.862
Now, everybody behave.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.118
We have a management
inspection.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.578
How do want it? By the book?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.078
Right from scratch, thanks.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.749
Okay. So, ladies, gentlemen,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.251
multisex, undecided or robot,

08:13.410 --> 08:16.209
my name
is Cathica Santini Khadeni.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.081
That's Cathica with a C,

08:18.164 --> 08:21.964
in case you wanna write
to Floor 500, praising me, and please do.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.671
Now, please feel free
to ask any questions.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.973
The process of news gathering
must be open,

08:27.048 --> 08:29.096
honest and beyond bias.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.552
That's company policy.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.933
Actually, urn, it's the law.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.442
Yes, thank you, Suki.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.443
Okay, keep it calm.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.234
Don't show off for the guests.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.072
Here we go.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.491
And...

08:47.068 --> 08:48.285
Engage safety.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.173
And three...

09:08.673 --> 09:11.096
Two... And spike!

09:16.097 --> 09:17.349
Compressed information

09:17.474 --> 09:18.976
streaming into her.

09:19.434 --> 09:22.813
Reports from every city,
every country, every planet,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.031
and they all get packaged
inside her head.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.408
She becomes part
of the software.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.327
Her brain is the computer!

09:30.070 --> 09:32.243
If it all goes through her,
she must be a genius.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.666
Nah, she wouldn't remember
any of it.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.327
There's too much.
Her head would blow up.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.663
The brain's the processor.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.748
Soon as it closes, she forgets.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.338
What about all these people
round the edge?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.340
They've all got tiny little
chips in their head

09:46.419 --> 09:50.515
connecting them to her,
and they transmit 600 channels.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.015
Every single fact
in the Empire beams out of this place.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.144
Now, that's what I call power.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.060
Analysis confirmed.
Security breach.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.735
I knew it. Which one?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.700
It's someone inside
that room. Which one?

10:11.653 --> 10:13.155
Isolating breach.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.041
Come on. Show me. Who is it?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.585
- You all right?
- I can see her brain.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.334
- Do you wanna get out?
- No, but this...

10:26.084 --> 10:28.382
This technology, it's...
It's amazing.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.380
This technology's wrong.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.183
Trouble?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.220
Oh, yeah.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.441
That's it! Ho, ho, ho, yes!

10:42.517 --> 10:45.896
She's the liar.
Intercept and scan.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.614
Gotcha!

10:55.530 --> 10:58.374
Come off it, Suki,
I wasn't even halfway. What was that for?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.201
Sorry.
It must've been a glitch.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.126
Her information's
been tampered with.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.504
There's a second biography
hidden underneath.

11:07.584 --> 11:11.805
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.976
Yeah, her data was encrypted but there's no
way we could have found her sooner.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.644
Yeah, sorry, I... Yeah, sorry, sir.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.939
Yea h, absolutely.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.772
Get her up here! Now!

11:26.227 --> 11:27.524
Promotion.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.816
Come on, this is it, come on!

11:31.566 --> 11:33.113
Oh, my God, make it me!

11:33.193 --> 11:36.572
Come on, say my name,
say my name, say my name!

11:38.573 --> 11:39.620
Promotion for...

11:40.825 --> 11:44.921
Suki Macrae Cantrell.
Please proceed to Floor 500.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.091
I don't believe it! Floor 500!

11:49.459 --> 11:51.587
How the hell
did you manage that? I'm above you!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.639
I don't know,
I just applied on the off chance.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.804
And they've said yes!

11:58.009 --> 12:01.479
So not fair. I've been applying
to Floor 500 for three years.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.393
What's Floor 500?

12:04.307 --> 12:06.150
The walls are made of gold.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.739
Cathica, I'm gonna miss you.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.900
- Floor 500. Thank you.
- I didn't do anything.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.610
You're my lucky charm.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.115
All right, I'll hug anyone.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.290
Come on, it's not that bad.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.585
What, with the...
The head thing?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.253
Yeah, well,
she's closed it now.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.750
Yeah, but...

12:28.414 --> 12:30.837
It's everything.
It freaks me out.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.587
- And I just need to...

12:34.671 --> 12:36.514
Ah, if I could just...

12:36.631 --> 12:39.100
Cool down, sort of acclimatise.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.726
How do you mean?

12:42.178 --> 12:45.933
Maybe I could just
go and sit on the observation deck.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.016
Will that be all right?

12:47.850 --> 12:51.525
Soak it in, you know.
Pretend I'm a citizen of the year 200,000.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.607
Do you want me
to come with you?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.200
No, no, you stick
with the Doctor.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.455
You'd rather be with him.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.870
It's gonna take a better man
than me to get between you two.

13:08.746 --> 13:09.998
Anyway...

13:10.081 --> 13:11.879
I'll be on the deck.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.715
Here you go,
take the Tardis key.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.922
You know, just in case
it gets a bit too much.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.549
Yeah, like it's not weird
in there.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.483
Oh, my God.
I've got to go, I can't keep them waiting.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.563
I'm sorry.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.280
Say goodbye to Steve for me.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.911
Bye!

13:42.405 --> 13:43.952
Good riddance.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.914
You're talking like you'll never see her again.
She's only going upstairs.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.421
We won't. Once you go to Floor 500,
you never come back.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.594
- Have you ever been up there?
- Can't.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.555
You need a key for the lift
and you only get a key with promotion.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.392
No one gets to 500,
except for the chosen few.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.226
Who are you?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.104
I'm the Editor.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.281
What's happening?

17:04.857 --> 17:08.202
There are bodies out there.
What's going on?

17:09.111 --> 17:12.080
While we're asking questions,
would you please confirm your name?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.868
My name is
Suki Macrae Cantrell.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.335
I was born 799 '89,

17:19.497 --> 17:21.464
in the Independent Republic
of Morocco.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.633
Liar!

17:22.916 --> 17:26.137
Hobbies include reading
and archaeology.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.590
I'm not' an expert or anything,
I just like digging.

17:28.673 --> 17:29.674
Liar!

17:29.966 --> 17:32.515
I want to work for
Satellite Five because

17:32.635 --> 17:34.933
my sister can't
afford university.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.140
And the pa y-scheme
is really good...

17:37.306 --> 17:38.307
Liar!

17:41.018 --> 17:42.395
Let's look at the facts,
shall we?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.151
Ah.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.779
Hidden behind a genetic graft,
but that's still you.

17:47.358 --> 17:51.363
Eva Saint Julienne, last surviving
member of the Freedom Fifteen.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.246
Hmm, self-declared anarchist.
Is that right?

17:55.324 --> 17:57.326
Who controls Satellite Five?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.920
There's the truth.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.517
The Freedom Foundation has been
monitoring Satellite Five's transmissions.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.725
We have absolute proof
that the facts are being manipulated.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.019
You are lying to the people.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.691
Ooh, I love it.
Say it again.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.856
This whole system is corrupt.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.356
Who do you represent?

18:27.064 --> 18:29.032
I'm merely a humble slave.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.068
I answer
to the Editor In Chief.

18:32.528 --> 18:36.203
- Who is he, where is he?
- He's overseeing everything.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.125
Literally everything.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.879
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
have to refer this upwards.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.508
- What is that?
- Your boss.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.723
This has always been your boss.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.096
Since the day you were born.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.824
Give me access.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.667
Give me...

19:28.709 --> 19:29.961
I can learn anything.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.640
Let's try, uh, computers.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.726
From the 21st century
to the present day,

19:41.806 --> 19:44.810
give me the history
of the microprocessor.

19:49.772 --> 19:50.773
Oh, my God.

19:51.315 --> 19:54.239
Look, they only give us 20 minutes
maintenance. Can't you give it a rest?

19:54.402 --> 19:56.842
But you've never been to another
ﬂoor? Not even one ﬂoor down?

19:58.739 --> 20:00.412
I went to ﬂoor 16
when I first arrived.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.891
That's medical, that's when
I got my head done. And then I...

20:03.119 --> 20:04.245
I came straight here.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.832
Satellite Five, you work, eat, and sleep on
the same floor, and that's it, that's all.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.302
You're not management, are you?

20:11.544 --> 20:12.796
At last! She's clever.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.966
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
don't involve me. I don't know anything.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.139
- Don't you even ask?
- Why would I?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.640
You're a journalist!

20:21.721 --> 20:23.018
Why's all the crew human?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.540
What's that got
to do with anything?

20:25.641 --> 20:27.143
There's no aliens on board.
Why?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.361
I don't know.
No real reason.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.148
- They're not banned or anything.
- Then where are they?

20:34.525 --> 20:37.278
I suppose Immigration's tightened up.
It's had to, what with all the threats.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.362
What threats?

20:39.613 --> 20:41.957
I don't know, all of them,
usual stuff.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.295
And the price of space warp
doubled, so that kept the visitors away.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.581
Oh, and the government
on Chavic Five collapsed,

20:48.664 --> 20:50.166
so that lot stopped coming, you see?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.465
Just lots of little reasons,
that's all.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.343
Adding up to one, great big fact.
And you didn't even notice.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.637
Doctor, I think, if there
was any sort of conspiracy,

20:59.717 --> 21:01.515
Satellite Five
would have seen it.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.763
- We see everything.
- I can see better.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.687
This society's the wrong shape,
even the technology.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.268
- It's cutting edge!
- It's backwards.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.852
There's a great big door
in your head.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.563
- You should've chucked this out years ago!
- So what you think's going on?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.861
It's not just this space station,
it's the whole attitude.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.112
It's the way people think.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.867
The Great and Bountiful Human Empire is
stunted. Something's holding it back.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.622
And how would you know?

21:21.739 --> 21:22.740
Trust me.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.455
Humanity's been
set back about 90 years.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.620
When did Satellite Five
start broadcasting?

21:29.205 --> 21:30.707
91 years ago.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.548
Mum, Dad, keep this message,
okay?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.012
Whatever you do,
don't erase it.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.056
Save it; you got that'?

21:49.183 --> 21:52.528
The microprocessor became
redundant in the year 2019,

21:52.603 --> 21:54.731
replaced by a system called,

21:54.814 --> 21:58.034
SMT, that's Single Molecule
Transcription.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.162
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?

22:01.237 --> 22:04.912
Come back, come...
Why are you doing that?

22:07.284 --> 22:09.582
What's Floor 16?
What's down there?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.108
Sorry, um...

22:38.440 --> 22:41.569
Floor 16, that's, um...
What do you cover?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.620
Medical non-emergency.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.200
Right, yeah, wrong ﬂoor.
I'm having technical difficulties.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.285
My screen keeps freezing,
locking me out.

22:49.952 --> 22:53.297
No, that's medical. There must be
something wrong with your chip.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.460
Yes!
Yeah, of course, yeah!

22:59.044 --> 23:00.170
I haven't got one.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.594
No wonder you can't
get a screen to work.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.804
What are you, a...

23:05.843 --> 23:06.844
Student?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.018
Yes. Yeah, I'm, um...

23:11.098 --> 23:13.317
I'm on a research project...

23:13.642 --> 23:15.815
From the University of Mars.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.323
The Martian boondocks, typical.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.482
Yep!

23:21.150 --> 23:22.572
Well, you still need chipping.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.830
So, does that mean, like...

23:26.780 --> 23:27.997
Brain surgery?

23:28.365 --> 23:30.117
That's an old-fashioned
phrase.

23:30.451 --> 23:31.703
But it's the same thing, yes.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.625
Oh!
Okay, never mind.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.666
But if I get a chip,

23:38.167 --> 23:40.420
that means I could use
any computer?

23:40.502 --> 23:41.970
Absolutely.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.390
You'll have to pay for it.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.309
They've stopped subsidising.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.521
Oh, right, sorry.
Wasting your time.

23:50.846 --> 23:51.972
Thanks.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.192
Hold on.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.359
Can I use this?

24:00.648 --> 24:01.991
That'll do nicely.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.406
It all comes down
to two basic types.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.614
Type one, the head chip,

24:08.739 --> 24:11.993
inserted into the back
of the skull, 100 credits.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.994
There's the chip.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.753
Tiny, invisible, no scarring.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.218
Type two is the full
info-spike.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.962
Oh, um, that's the...

24:25.172 --> 24:27.015
- Thing.
- That's the one.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.514
It does cost 10,000.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.555
Oh, well I, um,
I couldn't afford it then.

24:33.389 --> 24:37.769
Not at all.
Turns out you've got unlimited credit.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.157
No, but I...
Well, I couldn't have it done.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.577
I mean, that's gotta hurt,
hasn't it?

24:47.361 --> 24:49.739
Painless.
Contractual guarantee.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.117
No, my, my mate's
waiting upstairs,

24:53.200 --> 24:54.952
I can't have major surgery.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.747
It takes ten minutes.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.379
That sort of money buys
a very fast pico-surgeon.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.676
No, but I...

25:04.712 --> 25:06.180
I couldn't though, no.

25:10.092 --> 25:13.187
Type one, you can interface
with a simple computer.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.892
Type two, you are the computer.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.069
You can transmit any
piece of information

25:21.145 --> 25:22.772
from the archive
of Satellite Five

25:22.896 --> 25:27.117
which is just about the entire
history of the human race.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.405
Now...

25:32.948 --> 25:34.416
Which one's it going to be?

25:37.911 --> 25:39.629
We're so gonna get in trouble.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.336
You're not allowed to touch
the mainframe, we'll get told off.

25:45.461 --> 25:46.758
Rose, tell her to button it.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.882
You'll just vandalise the place,
someone's gonna notice.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.885
I don't understand.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.804
We did a full security scan,

25:55.888 --> 25:59.142
that man was there when
we found Suki Macrae Cantrell.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.065
There were no
indications about him.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.480
And yet here he is.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.858
Clearly acting
outside the parameters.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.786
Fascinating.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.416
Yes, sir.

26:18.744 --> 26:19.961
Absolutely.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.168
At once.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.041
Check him.

26:24.124 --> 26:27.344
Double check him,
triple check him, quadruple!

26:31.006 --> 26:33.225
This is nothing to do with me,
I'm going back to work.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.221
Go on then, see ya!
I can't just leave you, can I?

26:36.345 --> 26:39.394
If you wanna be useful, get them to turn
the heating down, it's boiling.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.434
What's wrong with this place?
Can't they do something about it?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.691
I don't know, we keep asking.
Something to do with the turbines.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.359
Something to do
with the turbines.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.027
But I don't know.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.325
Exactly. I give up
on you, Cathica.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.081
Now, Rose, look at Rose,
Rose is asking the right kind of questions.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.201
- Ah, thank you.
- Why is it so hot?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.158
One moment you're worried
about the Empire,

26:57.241 --> 26:59.209
and the next minute,
it's the central heating.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.920
Oh, never underestimate plumbing.
Plumbing is very important.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.835
Security scan complete.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.092
- Well, who is he?
- He is no one.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.641
What does that mean?

27:15.634 --> 27:16.931
He is no one.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.808
What, you mean
he has a fake ID?

27:20.013 --> 27:21.811
He has no identification.

27:22.516 --> 27:25.736
But everyone's registered.
We have a census for the entire Empire!

27:26.854 --> 27:28.071
He is no one.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.899
What, he doesn't exist?

27:30.232 --> 27:32.280
- Not anywhere?
- He is no one.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.531
What about the blonde?

27:34.736 --> 27:36.864
- She is no one.
- Both of them?

27:38.991 --> 27:42.211
Well, we all know what happens
to non-entities.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.579
They get promoted.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.166
Bring them up!

27:49.042 --> 27:52.592
Here we go, Satellite Five.
Pipes and plumbing. Look at the layout.

27:53.547 --> 27:54.924
This is ridiculous.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.430
You've got access to
the computer's core.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.221
You could look at the archive,
the news, the stock exchange...

28:01.346 --> 28:04.145
- And you're looking at pipes?
- But there's something wrong.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.231
- I suppose.
- Why, what is it?

28:08.604 --> 28:09.981
The ventilation system.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.112
Cooling ducts, ice filters.
All working ﬂat out.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.120
Channelling massive
amounts of heat down.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.493
- All the way from the top.
- Floor 500.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.242
Something up there
is generating tons and tons of heat.

28:21.825 --> 28:24.954
Well, I don't know about you,
but I feel like I'm missing out on a party.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.956
It's all going on upstairs.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.208
- Fancy a trip?
- You can't, you need a key.

28:29.291 --> 28:32.921
Keys are just codes, and I've got
the codes right here. Here we go.

28:33.503 --> 28:37.053
Override 215.9.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.639
How come it's giving
you the code?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.142
Someone up there likes me.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.861
I told you it was painless.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.322
No scarring, you see?

28:57.527 --> 28:58.904
Perfect success.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.324
How do I activate it?

29:03.033 --> 29:04.580
It's a personal choice.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.503
Some people whistle.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.212
I know one man who triggers it
with Oh, Danny Boy.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.094
But you're set
on default for now.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.217
That's a click of the fingers.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.841
So, you mean I just...

29:21.093 --> 29:22.094
Click.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.817
- Come on, come with us.
- No way!

29:28.892 --> 29:31.520
- Bye!
- Well, don't mention my name.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.281
When you get in trouble,
just don't involve me.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.820
That's her gone, Adam's given up,
looks like it's just you and me.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.324
- Yeah.
- Good.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.030
Yep.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.464
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be sick!

30:09.266 --> 30:10.609
Special offer.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.692
We installed the vomit-o-matic
at the same time.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.406
Nano-termites have been placed
in the lining of your throat.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.153
In the event of sickness,

30:20.152 --> 30:21.904
they freeze the waste.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.377
The walls are not made of gold.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.255
You should go back downstairs.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.469
Tough.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.069
I started without you.

31:02.444 --> 31:03.787
This is fascinating.

31:04.404 --> 31:07.248
Satellite Five contains
every piece of information

31:07.324 --> 31:10.043
within the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

31:10.285 --> 31:14.916
Birth certificates, shopping habits,
bank statements, but you two...

31:15.874 --> 31:17.126
You don't exist.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.007
There's not a trace.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.723
No birth, no job,
not the slightest kiss.

31:23.006 --> 31:26.260
How can you walk through
the world and not leave a single footprint?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.470
Suki! Suki!

31:29.388 --> 31:30.389
Hello?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.691
Can you hear me? Suki?

31:33.183 --> 31:35.686
- What have you clone to her?
- I think she's dead.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.940
But she's working.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.985
They've all got chips in their head,
and the chips keep going.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.158
- Like puppets.
- Oh!

31:46.029 --> 31:47.451
You are full of information.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.704
But it's only fair we get
some information back.

31:49.825 --> 31:52.749
Because, apparently
you're no one.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.922
It's so rare
not to know something.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.089
Who are you?

31:57.499 --> 31:59.968
It doesn't matter,
'cause we're off. Nice to meet you.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.135
Come on!

32:03.797 --> 32:04.844
Tell me who you are.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.097
Since that information is keeping us alive,
I'm hardly gonna say, am I?

32:09.010 --> 32:11.854
Well, perhaps my
Editor-In-Chief can convince you otherwise.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.185
And who's that?

32:15.559 --> 32:16.981
It may interest you to know

32:17.060 --> 32:20.109
that this is not the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.907
In fact, it's not actually
human at all.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.869
It's merely a place
where humans happen to live.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.702
Yep. YEP-

32:31.241 --> 32:32.333
Sorry!

32:33.702 --> 32:35.579
It's a place where humans
are allowed to live

32:36.037 --> 32:38.005
by kind permission
of my client.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.060
What is that?

32:51.470 --> 32:54.314
You mean that thing's in
charge of Satellite Five?

32:54.764 --> 32:58.985
"That thing", as you put it,
is in charge of the human race.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.107
For almost 100 years,
mankind has been shaped and guided.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.490
His knowledge and ambition,
strictly controlled by its broadcast news.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.412
Edited by my superior,
your master,

33:10.572 --> 33:12.370
and humanity's guiding light,

33:12.908 --> 33:16.287
the Mighty Jagrafess of the
Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.089
I call him Max.

33:56.952 --> 34:00.957
Create a climate of fear,
and it's easy to keep the borders closed.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.800
It's just a matter of emphasis.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.552
The right word
in the right broadcast,

34:06.628 --> 34:09.222
repeated often enough,
can destabilize an economy.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.344
Invent an enemy.
Change a vote.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.681
So all the people on
Earth are like slaves?

34:15.303 --> 34:17.772
Well, now,
there's an interesting point.

34:17.973 --> 34:21.898
Is a slave a slave if
he doesn't know he's enslaved?

34:21.976 --> 34:22.978
Yes.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.772
Oh, I was hoping
for a philosophical debate.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.482
Is that all I'm gonna get?
"Yes"?

34:27.607 --> 34:28.984
- Yes.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.322
You're no fun.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.339
Let me out of these manacles.
You'll find out how much fun I am.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.616
Oh, he's tough, isn't he?

34:35.991 --> 34:38.289
But come on!
Isn't it a great system?

34:38.368 --> 34:40.120
You've got to admire it,
just a little bit.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.630
You can't hide something on this scale,
somebody must've noticed.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.467
From time to time,
someone, yes.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.888
But the computer chip system
allows me to see inside their brains.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.179
I can see the smallest doubt
and crush it.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.076
And then they just carry on,

35:12.152 --> 35:15.156
living the life,
strutting about downstairs

35:15.238 --> 35:18.458
and all over the surface
of the Earth, like they're so individual.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.082
When, of course, they're not.
They're just cattle.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.710
In that respect, the Jagrafess
hasn't changed a thing.

35:25.498 --> 35:29.048
But what about you?
You're not Jagra... Uh, belly...

35:29.210 --> 35:32.009
- Jagrafess.
- Jagrafess. You're not a Jagrafess.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.089
You're human.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.808
Yeah, well, simply being human
doesn't pay very well.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.182
But you couldn't have done this
all on your own.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.513
No!

35:39.596 --> 35:42.065
I represent a consortium
of banks.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.985
Money prefers
a long-term investment.

35:45.393 --> 35:49.443
Also the Jagrafess needed a little
hand to, um, install himself.

35:50.023 --> 35:52.697
No wonder,
creature that size. What's its lifespan?

35:52.817 --> 35:53.818
3,000 years.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.621
That's one hell
of a metabolism, generating all that heat.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.575
That's why
Satellite Five's so hot.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.706
You pump it out the creature,
channel it downstairs.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.334
Jagrafess stays cool,
stays alive.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.209
Satellite Five is one great
big life-support system.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.183
Me again.
Don't wipe this message.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.010
It's just gonna sound like
white noise.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.597
But save it,
'cause I can translate it, okay?

36:26.142 --> 36:27.314
Three,

36:27.394 --> 36:28.737
two,

36:29.062 --> 36:31.190
one, and spike!

36:36.277 --> 36:38.450
But that's why
you're so dangerous.

36:38.947 --> 36:42.372
Knowledge is power,
but you remain unknown.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.794
Who are you?

36:54.629 --> 36:56.427
Leave her alone!
I'm the Doctor.

36:56.506 --> 36:59.100
She's Rose Tyler,
we're nothing, we're just wandering.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.348
- Tell me who you are!
- I've just said!

37:01.428 --> 37:03.055
Yeah, but who do you work for?

37:03.138 --> 37:05.391
Who sent you?
Who knows about us?

37:05.473 --> 37:06.565
Who exactly...

37:12.981 --> 37:14.233
Time Lord.

37:14.691 --> 37:15.692
What?

37:15.775 --> 37:19.450
Oh, yes!
The last of the Time Lords.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.156
And his travelling machine.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.785
With his little human girl
from long ago.

37:24.868 --> 37:27.872
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Time travel!

37:33.501 --> 37:35.344
Someone's been telling
you lies.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.514
Young master Adam Mitchell?

37:44.512 --> 37:46.139
Oh, my God, his head.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.141
What the hell's he done?

37:49.350 --> 37:51.023
What the hell's he gone
and done?

37:52.103 --> 37:54.356
They're reading his mind,
he's telling them everything.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.613
And through him,
I know everything about you.

37:57.692 --> 38:01.037
Every piece of information
in his head is now mine.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.032
And you have infinite
knowledge, Doctor.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.417
The Human Empire is tiny

38:06.493 --> 38:07.995
compared to what you've seen
in your

38:08.077 --> 38:10.500
T-A-R-D-I-S.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.581
Tardis!

38:11.706 --> 38:13.504
Well, you'll never get your hands on it,
I'll die first!

38:13.583 --> 38:16.883
Well, die all you like,
I don't need ya. I've got the key.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.557
You and your boyfriends!

38:28.640 --> 38:31.564
Today, we are the headlines.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.228
We can rewrite history.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.814
We could prevent mankind
from ever developing.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.240
And no one's gonna stop you.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.403
Because you bred a human race
which doesn't bother to ask questions.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.455
Stupid little slaves
believing every lie.

38:44.614 --> 38:48.869
They'll just trot right into the slaughter
house if they're told it's made of gold.

39:05.426 --> 39:06.769
Disengage safety.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.893
What's happening?

39:14.269 --> 39:17.523
Maximum access,
override Floor 139.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.907
And... Spike!

39:26.406 --> 39:28.124
Someone's disengaged
the safety.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.960
Who's that?

39:35.582 --> 39:37.630
- It's Cathica.
- And she's thinking.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.632
She's using what she knows.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.797
Terminate her access.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.973
Everything I told her
about Satellite Five,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.176
the pipes, the filters,
she's reversing it.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.811
Look at that.
It's getting hot.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.518
I said, terminate.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.732
Burn out her mind.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.318
Oh, no, you don't!

40:00.189 --> 40:02.658
You should've
promoted me years back.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.553
She's venting the heat up here.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.306
The Jagrafess needs
to stay cool,

40:32.388 --> 40:34.732
and now it's sitting
on top of a volcano!

40:38.853 --> 40:40.730
Yes, I'm trying, sir.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.278
But I don't know how she did it,
it's impossible.

40:43.733 --> 40:45.531
A member of staff with an idea!

40:54.619 --> 40:56.462
- What do I do?
- Flick the switch!

41:14.013 --> 41:15.936
Oi, mate!
You want to bank on a certainty?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.980
Massive heat in a massive body,

41:18.309 --> 41:19.561
massive bang!

41:20.311 --> 41:21.563
See you in the headlines!

41:28.152 --> 41:30.746
Actually, sir, if it's all the
same to you, I think I'll resign.

41:30.822 --> 41:31.914
Bye, then.

41:34.867 --> 41:35.914
Let go of me!

41:45.795 --> 41:47.263
Let go of me!

41:47.672 --> 41:49.015
Let go of me!

42:13.114 --> 42:14.707
We're just gonna go.
I hate tidying up.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.284
Too many questions.
You'll manage.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.457
You'll have to stay and explain it.
No one's gonna believe me.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.462
Well, they might start
believing a lot of things now.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.916
Human race should accelerate.
All back to normal.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.174
What about your friend?

42:24.709 --> 42:26.211
He's not my friend.

42:28.671 --> 42:29.923
Now, don't...

42:30.506 --> 42:32.474
I'm all right now.
Much better.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.140
And I've got the key.
Look, it's...

42:35.470 --> 42:36.813
And, well...

42:36.971 --> 42:39.224
It all worked out
for the best, didn't it?

42:41.225 --> 42:45.605
You know, it's not actually my fault,
because you were in charge.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.155
It's my house. I'm home.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.278
Oh, my God, I'm home!

42:53.154 --> 42:55.953
Blimey. I thought you
were gonna chuck me out of an airlock.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.330
Is there something else
you want to tell me?

42:58.451 --> 43:00.499
No. Erm, what do you mean?

43:02.997 --> 43:04.340
The archive of Satellite Five.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.700
One second of that message
could have changed the world.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.012
That's it, then. See ya.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.688
- How do you mean, "See ya"?
- As in, goodbye.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.023
What about me?

43:21.140 --> 43:22.642
You can't just go.
I've got my head.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.443
I've got a chip type two.
My head opens.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.736
- What, like this?

43:27.021 --> 43:28.068
Don't!

43:28.272 --> 43:29.740
Don't do what?

43:31.359 --> 43:32.531
Stop it!

43:33.694 --> 43:36.743
All right now, Doctor.
That's enough. Stop it.

43:38.825 --> 43:40.042
Thank you.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.080
- Oi!
- Sorry, I couldn't resist.

43:44.038 --> 43:46.006
The whole of history
could have changed because of you.

43:46.082 --> 43:47.208
I just wanted to help.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.467
You were helping yourself.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.884
And I'm sorry. And I've said I'm
sorry, and I am, I really am.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.468
But you can't just
leave me like this.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.869
Yes, I can. 'Cause if you show that head to
anyone, they'll dissect you in seconds.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.474
You'll have to lead a very quiet life.
Keep out of trouble.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.727
Be average. Unseen. Good luck.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.478
But I wanna come with you.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.897
I only take the best.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.320
I've got Rose.

44:08.729 --> 44:09.901
Rose, Rose!

44:10.481 --> 44:12.404
- Oh, my God!
- Who's that?

44:12.900 --> 44:15.744
- Geoff, is that you?
- It's me, Mum.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.447
Don't come in,
wait there a minute.

44:17.613 --> 44:21.038
Oh, my Lord! You never told me
you were coming home!

44:21.534 --> 44:23.502
Hold on,
I'll just take my coat off.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.713
I wish you'd told me
you were coming home.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.381
Rose, take me with you.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.380
I would've
got your favourite tea in.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.346
What's that noise?

44:33.462 --> 44:34.742
Have you left
the back door open?

44:35.089 --> 44:36.591
Blimey, there's a draft.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.180
What a surprise!

44:38.634 --> 44:41.012
Oh, let me look at you.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.690
Ah, six months.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.772
It's like I saw you yesterday.
Isn't it funny?

44:46.851 --> 44:48.228
- The time goes by like that.

44:55.151 --> 44:57.620
Your wish is my command,
but be careful what you wish for.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.037
The day my father died.

44:59.322 --> 45:01.802
Thought it'd be all grim and stormy.
It's just an ordinary day.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.208
Oh, God, this is it.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.001
He can't die on his own!

45:06.829 --> 45:08.502
Can I try again?

45:10.291 --> 45:11.463
Oh, gosh, this is it.

45:11.876 --> 45:13.093
Rose! No!

45:15.087 --> 45:17.089
I did it again,
I picked another stupid ape!

45:17.465 --> 45:18.887
It's not like
I've changed history.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.852
Rose, there's a man
alive in the world who wasn't alive before.

45:22.303 --> 45:24.647
The whole world's different
because he's alive!

45:26.599 --> 45:29.648
Time's been damaged,
and they've come to sterilise the wound.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.733
Rose, get in the church!
