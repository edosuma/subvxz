WEBVTT

00:19.603 --> 00:21.438
Jaeyi... Jaeyi!

00:26.735 --> 00:27.778
Jaeyi!

00:29.112 --> 00:29.947
Doyoon!

00:32.281 --> 00:33.158
Jaeyi.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.121
What is this? Where are we?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.374
How is this possible?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.169
What I'm about say is going to be
difficult to understand.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.839
I trust you'll understand
since you were also a scientist.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.299
What are you talking about?

00:49.383 --> 00:52.094
You and I are in a brain sync right now.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.304
What?

00:54.388 --> 00:57.099
Using brain waves in the hippocampus,

00:57.182 --> 00:59.101
I was able to sync my brain
with dead people--

00:59.184 --> 01:01.228
Wait. Dead people?

01:01.311 --> 01:02.312
Jaeyi.

01:03.981 --> 01:04.982
Just listen to me.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.359
Are you telling me that I'm dead?

01:07.442 --> 01:08.443
No.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.530
You're not dead.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.408
I would've seen your memories of Doyoon
if you were dead.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.704
You're in a coma right now.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.331
What happened?

01:21.707 --> 01:23.417
Why am I in a coma?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.627
You tried to take your own life.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.427
No. There's just no way.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.304
Why would I ever do that?

01:36.138 --> 01:40.434
Leave you and Doyoon?
I would never do something like that.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.019
Jaeyi.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.646
If we want to find Doyoon,
you have to calm down.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.900
Do you...

01:49.359 --> 01:51.403
remember where Doyoon is right now?

02:02.623 --> 02:03.957
What are you doing here?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.001
Do you remember something?

02:06.502 --> 02:07.461
Huh?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.717
I think I was looking for something...

02:14.301 --> 02:16.929
but I can't remember
what I was looking for.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.099
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.352
Jaeyi... Jaeyi...

02:24.436 --> 02:25.896
It's painful, but we have to try.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.949
Doyoon!

02:42.704 --> 02:44.456
Doyoon!

02:53.173 --> 02:54.007
I can't.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.218
I can't.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.720
It's alright. It's alright.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.514
It's okay.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.016
What do we do?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.480
Jaeyi, take a deep breath.

03:08.564 --> 03:11.400
Let's try one last time, okay?

03:22.536 --> 03:25.080
You said that a brain sync
with dead people...

03:29.001 --> 03:31.170
lets you see
their memories clearly, right?

03:31.837 --> 03:32.838
What?

03:47.853 --> 03:48.854
No.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.355
Jaeyi.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.065
Jaeyi!

04:05.871 --> 04:07.706
I'm stuck in a coma.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.751
I can't help anyone like this.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.087
Please, you have to let me go.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.425
Jaeyi, not like this. You can't.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.719
You said you wanted my help.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.349
So let me help you.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.562
Promise me...

04:31.980 --> 04:33.649
that you'll find our son.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.609
Jaeyi, no. I beg you.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.946
Don't, please...

04:41.573 --> 04:45.035
Thank you so much
for finally showing me that you care.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.121
No, no, no. Jaeyi, no!

04:54.711 --> 04:56.004
Jaeyi!

05:13.063 --> 05:13.897
Jaeyi!

05:23.240 --> 05:24.074
Sewon.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.292
Please, Sewon, stop...

05:34.084 --> 05:35.294
Sewon.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.839
Jaeyi. Jaeyi.

05:56.190 --> 06:00.861
DR. BRAIN

06:07.075 --> 06:08.202
Maybe...

06:12.456 --> 06:15.167
She doesn't have to be gone for good.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.252
What do you mean?

06:20.923 --> 06:22.341
I'm still here, aren't I?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.602
You're right.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.605
We need to stop my heart.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.148
What?

06:38.941 --> 06:41.944
I can see Kangmu Lee,
unlike all the other subjects.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.279
I can talk to him, as if he were alive.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.700
This means if we can replicate
what we did with Kangmu Lee...

06:49.326 --> 06:51.578
Jaeyi might actually appear.

06:53.539 --> 06:57.209
Even if you're right, inducing
a cardiac arrest is way too risky.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.961
You could die!

06:59.044 --> 07:01.338
I need to see her memories clearly.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.466
It's the only way to find Doyoon.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.135
Jaeyi said the same.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.304
She's willing to do
whatever it takes to save him.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.849
What if I can't bring you back?

07:12.683 --> 07:14.518
What happens to Doyoon then?

07:15.477 --> 07:16.311
Namil...

07:17.688 --> 07:19.022
I know you can do it.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.234
I'll definitely be back.

07:23.235 --> 07:26.530
Jaeyi and I are going to find our son,
and be together.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.534
Lower my body temperature
to 30 degrees Celsius.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.953
Then stop my heart.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.832
Wait five minutes, then revive me.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.729
Our program is specially designed
for children like Doyoon.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.732
As you can see, this has been proven

08:43.815 --> 08:45.901
by multiple case studies.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.548
Dr. Hyun, Hyunju in room 301
is having a seizure.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.593
I'm sorry,
could you excuse me for a moment?

09:29.862 --> 09:31.655
Turritopsis...

10:35.177 --> 10:36.428
Doyoon!

10:36.512 --> 10:37.721
Doyoon!

10:38.347 --> 10:39.348
Doyoon!

10:44.144 --> 10:45.354
Doyoon!

10:45.896 --> 10:47.147
Doyoon!

10:48.440 --> 10:50.317
Doyoon!

10:50.400 --> 10:51.485
What's going on?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.155
Open this right now! Doyoon is in here.

10:55.239 --> 10:58.033
What are you talking about?
Ma'am, you need to calm down.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.370
- You seem a little worked up right now--
- But I just saw my son!

11:01.787 --> 11:03.497
Open this door immediately!

11:04.957 --> 11:05.958
Alright.

11:23.559 --> 11:24.643
Doyoon?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.491
Ma'am, I think that's enough for today.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.357
Sewon, please pick up...

12:48.352 --> 12:49.353
Who is it?

12:50.729 --> 12:52.564
I'm from the clinic.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.858
Dr. Hyun prescribed
some medication for you.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.503
Thank you so much.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.473
The doctor instructed me
to watch you take them.

13:45.576 --> 13:46.577
Are we good?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.245
She said you should take all of them.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.329
What?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.127
Please leave. Who are you?

14:24.489 --> 14:27.117
SEWON

15:38.021 --> 15:40.357
Can't leave any loose ends...

15:47.823 --> 15:51.326
Now everyone will think that
you followed your son to the other side.

15:56.707 --> 15:58.876
We'll take good care of Doyoon.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.484
Sewon! Sewon!

16:24.568 --> 16:26.278
Hey! Wake up!

16:43.378 --> 16:45.547
Sewon! Sewon!

16:45.631 --> 16:47.716
Wake up, Sewon!

16:56.934 --> 16:58.352
Sewon!

16:58.894 --> 16:59.728
Sewon!

17:08.319 --> 17:09.238
Jaeyi...

17:10.489 --> 17:11.448
Jaeyi...

17:12.406 --> 17:13.784
Jaeyi...

17:14.617 --> 17:15.993
Jaeyi.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.835
Jaeyi.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.816
Jaeyi?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.014
We have to go upstairs.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.392
- What?
- We have to go upstairs.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.134
Wait, what's this?

18:57.679 --> 18:59.806
Looks like a company
connected to Dr. Myung.

19:01.517 --> 19:04.019
It's similar to the one
in Jaeyi's memories.

19:15.364 --> 19:16.448
Ji Un Choi speaking.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.367
Hey, Lieutenant Choi. Hold on a sec.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.118
Sewon, she's on the line.

19:21.370 --> 19:22.871
I think we found a clue.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.790
Turritopsis.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.417
We need to find any company,
or even research center,

19:27.501 --> 19:28.919
called Turritopsis or Red Jellyfish.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.130
Could be a scientific
or medical equipment company,

19:32.214 --> 19:34.842
or even a research foundation.
Anything research related.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.224
Nothing about Red Jellyfish,

19:42.307 --> 19:45.853
but I see an international
joint venture company called Turritopsis.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.564
Their next experiment will be
beyond anything I've ever done.

19:48.647 --> 19:49.982
It's much more sophisticated.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.151
The testing environment
will be extremely important.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.322
Somewhere far from residential
and commercial areas.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.075
A place that minimizes
external stimuli.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.744
No electronic interference.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.414
Could be somewhere underground.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.540
Let me look into it.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.257
I got it.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.717
Inje, Gangwon Province.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.469
It looks like they own
a bunker in a tunnel.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.722
That's it. It has to be.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.599
Wait.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.644
This location was recently shut down.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.146
What?

20:34.776 --> 20:36.778
We don't have time for this.

20:36.862 --> 20:39.823
We have the location.
Now we need to move quickly.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.450
I'll call for backup.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.744
Okay. Let's go.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.938
Dr. Myung, how are you feeling today?

21:53.397 --> 21:54.606
I'm wonderful.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.361
Today, my life's dream
and mission will be fulfilled.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.030
From this moment forward,

22:02.114 --> 22:05.409
countless others will be able
to have infinite dreams.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.049
Let's do it.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.135
May I be of assistance?

22:50.162 --> 22:51.914
Placing the brain lid on your cranium.

23:16.313 --> 23:17.814
We've identified the child.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.900
Jung Hwan Park,
reported missing two years ago.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.027
He was treated at Saera Children's Clinic.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.300
Wait a minute.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.553
Do you know how to use a gun?

23:49.555 --> 23:50.681
No, I don't.

23:50.764 --> 23:51.765
I've used one before.

24:33.724 --> 24:34.975
The door's open.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.294
They haven't been dead for very long.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.338
They've been shot.

25:05.297 --> 25:07.299
That means we're not the only ones here.

25:07.883 --> 25:08.884
What is this?

25:10.260 --> 25:11.553
What's going on here?

25:26.735 --> 25:27.569
That way.

26:04.982 --> 26:07.276
They're using an insane amount
of electricity right now.

26:11.572 --> 26:13.240
I think the generator is running.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.035
When it reaches full power,
the transfer will start.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.495
Then it'll be too late.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.205
Then which way should we go?

26:20.998 --> 26:23.041
There has to be a way down.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.711
The deeper underground,
the less interference there is.

27:18.430 --> 27:22.351
So, did you think
I was just your little bitch?

27:23.018 --> 27:24.937
Did you think
you could get rid of me so easily?

27:26.104 --> 27:28.774
Well, seeing as you got this far,

27:28.857 --> 27:31.026
I admit that I underestimated you.

27:31.109 --> 27:34.738
Huh? "Admit"?

27:34.821 --> 27:37.783
I don't think you understand
what's happening here.

27:37.866 --> 27:41.662
Why don't you put that away,
and we renegotiate our deal?

27:41.745 --> 27:45.207
Nah, bit too late for that.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.292
I have my own plans.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.629
I'm taking the kid
and getting out of here.

27:51.255 --> 27:54.675
Then I'm going to make a deal
with your bosses.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.846
I think this is it for you.

28:25.998 --> 28:27.082
Son of a bitch.

28:31.170 --> 28:33.338
You're one stubborn little shit!

28:33.422 --> 28:34.548
Freeze!

28:48.979 --> 28:50.480
Go get your son. Hurry!

28:53.108 --> 28:53.942
Doyoon!

28:57.404 --> 28:58.906
We have to get him out of there!

29:23.597 --> 29:24.431
Doyoon!

29:25.766 --> 29:26.600
Doyoon!

29:36.860 --> 29:37.861
Stop!

29:51.375 --> 29:52.167
It's too late.

29:53.377 --> 29:55.796
Sorry, but it's over.

30:30.873 --> 30:32.332
Dr. Koh...

30:32.416 --> 30:34.710
I had nothing to do
with what happened to Doyoon.

30:34.793 --> 30:37.212
This was between
Dr. Hyun and Secretary Yoon.

30:38.463 --> 30:39.882
Keep your mouth shut...

30:40.382 --> 30:41.800
before I kill you all.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.336
Sewon, what are you going to do?

31:18.212 --> 31:19.755
I'm going to sync with Doyoon.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.715
Connect me with him.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.217
What?

31:23.300 --> 31:26.011
Dr. Myung's brain waves
are beginning to take over Doyoon's.

31:27.137 --> 31:30.349
If new brain waves interfere,
the defense mechanisms will activate.

31:31.475 --> 31:35.687
Then Dr. Myung's brain waves
will be forced to focus on me.

31:35.771 --> 31:37.648
Sewon, that's insane.

31:38.148 --> 31:41.527
Dr. Myung's brain waves are amplified
by the generator.

31:41.610 --> 31:43.654
Your consciousness will be crushed.

31:43.737 --> 31:46.156
As soon as his brain waves
converge with mine,

31:46.240 --> 31:48.408
amplify my wave parameters to the maximum.

31:48.492 --> 31:51.203
But that's basically double suicide!

31:51.286 --> 31:53.497
No brain can survive that much shock.

31:54.039 --> 31:56.875
You'll be brain-dead.
Seriously, you'll die!

31:58.752 --> 32:02.589
But you know my brain is different.

32:03.423 --> 32:05.425
How many brain syncs have I done so far?

32:07.094 --> 32:09.346
I've built up a tolerance
to foreign brain waves.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.473
And I can recover quickly.

32:13.684 --> 32:16.061
Take the brain lid off Dr. Myung's head.

32:16.687 --> 32:18.397
Maintain current brain wave levels.

32:20.566 --> 32:22.484
Stop saying crazy shit!

32:22.568 --> 32:25.612
If you meddle with the system,
you could overload it.

32:25.696 --> 32:28.407
You have absolutely no idea
what could happen here!

32:28.490 --> 32:32.077
Doyoon, you, all of us here,
we could all die!

32:32.160 --> 32:33.579
That's right.

32:33.662 --> 32:37.499
If I can't bring Doyoon back,
you and everyone else in here will die.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.878
If you've gotten this far,
you were aware of the risks.

32:50.345 --> 32:51.346
Damn it.

34:04.461 --> 34:05.504
Oh, no.

34:07.381 --> 34:08.882
Shit...

34:10.217 --> 34:12.594
What should I chop off first? Your neck?

34:13.303 --> 34:15.138
Hands? Feet?

35:42.267 --> 35:43.435
Dr. Myung...

35:47.773 --> 35:48.941
No.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.442
Dr. Myung!

35:54.404 --> 35:55.739
Doyoon...

35:57.115 --> 36:00.786
I'm about to go into your brain.

36:02.037 --> 36:03.580
So don't be afraid.

36:04.957 --> 36:07.459
Don't hide or run. Just hang in there.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.550
I'll be with you soon, alright?

36:16.593 --> 36:17.886
Dr. Myung!

36:31.400 --> 36:33.735
The moment Dr. Myung's
brain waves cross over...

36:34.778 --> 36:36.822
maximize the stimulation.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.993
I don't know
if I can get the timing right.

36:41.493 --> 36:42.452
I'll do my best...

36:44.830 --> 36:46.290
to give you a hand signal.

36:59.803 --> 37:01.013
We're ready.

38:25.806 --> 38:27.224
Excuse me.

38:28.141 --> 38:30.602
Have we met before?

38:35.107 --> 38:37.401
You and I met a very long time ago.

38:39.069 --> 38:40.821
But you may not remember.

38:44.533 --> 38:45.701
Where are we?

38:47.077 --> 38:49.037
It's my old school.

38:50.205 --> 38:54.668
I first dreamt of becoming
a brain scientist right here.

38:56.420 --> 39:00.632
I come here every once in a while
when I need to clear my head.

39:02.759 --> 39:04.511
What are you doing here now?

39:05.304 --> 39:07.181
I'm waiting...

39:09.641 --> 39:11.226
for my son.

39:12.728 --> 39:16.315
I've never waited for anyone
like this before.

39:25.657 --> 39:28.452
Do you have children of your own?

39:29.453 --> 39:31.121
I have a son.

39:31.205 --> 39:34.875
What does it feel like to be a father?

39:36.502 --> 39:37.628
Well...

39:40.130 --> 39:41.840
I'm always wondering...

39:44.927 --> 39:46.887
where he is, or what he's doing.

39:49.097 --> 39:50.724
And what he's thinking about.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.396
I wonder if he's in pain or lonely.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.858
Right.

40:01.610 --> 40:03.946
I always feel that way.

40:04.029 --> 40:06.573
The older the child grows...

40:08.659 --> 40:12.621
the more you have to better yourself.

40:18.585 --> 40:22.923
You were such a great and strong presence.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.525
You must be Sewon, then.

40:44.194 --> 40:45.112
Yes, Dr. Myung.

41:14.141 --> 41:15.434
Sewon...

41:18.812 --> 41:20.022
That's right.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.650
So the one I was waiting for...

41:25.569 --> 41:27.112
was you, right?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.034
Yes, Father.

41:33.785 --> 41:34.786
Now I can...

41:36.872 --> 41:39.458
I can understand emotions
I wasn't able to before.

41:46.590 --> 41:48.050
Dr. Myung...

41:50.010 --> 41:50.928
No, Father...

41:52.804 --> 41:54.014
Please forgive me...

41:55.933 --> 41:58.227
for not recognizing your love.

41:59.853 --> 42:01.480
Dr. Myung...

42:05.359 --> 42:07.110
I need one last favor from you.

42:11.365 --> 42:13.075
Will you give me back my son?

42:13.158 --> 42:14.326
I beg of you.

42:50.487 --> 42:52.030
Sewon...

42:55.325 --> 42:57.494
It's all over.

43:01.206 --> 43:04.501
It's too late, Son.

43:07.129 --> 43:10.674
It's time for you to accept that now.

43:16.054 --> 43:18.056
Do you see that door over there?

43:20.309 --> 43:24.438
Once I go and walk through
that door, it's over.

43:25.189 --> 43:28.817
Everything will begin anew.

43:31.111 --> 43:35.532
Now, I'm going to go
through it with Doyoon.

43:36.283 --> 43:38.952
And there will be a new beginning.

43:44.458 --> 43:47.044
So go back. Just go back.

43:47.503 --> 43:48.962
Just go back.

43:53.050 --> 43:56.345
No, there's no way I will let that happen.

43:57.804 --> 43:59.598
Doyoon is going back with me.

44:09.816 --> 44:11.443
You are such a fool.

44:12.194 --> 44:14.988
It's too late for those realizations.

44:16.198 --> 44:19.910
I'm not the only one to blame
for all of this.

45:06.456 --> 45:11.545
You see, most people
make promises about the afterlife.

45:11.628 --> 45:14.464
They'll say something like,
"See you on the other side."

45:16.133 --> 45:20.470
Unfortunately,
I can't even say that to you...

45:21.555 --> 45:25.100
since I am never going to die.

45:30.022 --> 45:31.607
Doyoon!

45:34.443 --> 45:35.444
Doyoon...

45:35.527 --> 45:37.070
Doyoon, don't! Get away!

45:52.586 --> 45:54.296
Hello, Doyoon.

45:55.172 --> 45:57.174
It's all over now.

45:58.008 --> 46:00.552
Come on. Let's go.

46:00.636 --> 46:01.637
Doyoon.

46:02.387 --> 46:03.305
Doyoon.

46:06.308 --> 46:07.434
Doyoon!

46:13.148 --> 46:14.983
Doyoon, don't go! No!

46:15.734 --> 46:16.902
Doyoon!

46:25.911 --> 46:26.745
Now!

47:35.856 --> 47:36.732
Doyoon!

47:40.652 --> 47:42.988
Wait, how can you...

47:48.493 --> 47:50.120
You have to stop this now.

48:04.551 --> 48:07.304
There's no way
you can win against me in here.

48:08.931 --> 48:13.101
Dr. Myung, this is only your first sync.

48:18.106 --> 48:20.567
I've risked my life on these experiments

48:20.651 --> 48:22.819
from the moment Jaeyi fell into a coma.

48:30.369 --> 48:31.495
Are we...

48:32.246 --> 48:34.623
Are we inside your brain?

48:45.050 --> 48:46.593
No, it can't be!

48:46.677 --> 48:48.428
It can't be!

48:48.846 --> 48:50.764
This is my world!

48:50.848 --> 48:52.724
I am the master of all this!

48:53.517 --> 48:55.978
I am infinite!

48:56.061 --> 48:57.604
I am imperishable.

48:57.688 --> 48:59.398
I am immortal!

49:00.315 --> 49:02.150
This can't be happening.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.987
I am immortal!

49:05.821 --> 49:07.239
I am...

49:34.641 --> 49:38.103
I won't cease to exist!

49:41.231 --> 49:43.442
I can't die.

49:43.525 --> 49:49.656
I need to live for humanity's sake...

50:04.463 --> 50:06.215
Rest in peace, Father.

50:30.322 --> 50:31.323
Doyoon.

50:33.659 --> 50:34.493
Doyoon!

50:35.619 --> 50:36.703
Doyoon Koh!

50:49.299 --> 50:50.259
Doyoon!

50:55.305 --> 50:56.139
Doyoon!

51:08.235 --> 51:09.486
Doyoon!

51:12.990 --> 51:13.824
Doyoon.

51:31.091 --> 51:32.384
Doyoon...

51:36.263 --> 51:37.723
It's me, Dad.

51:37.806 --> 51:40.142
Come on out, huh?

51:42.895 --> 51:43.770
Doyoon.

51:54.740 --> 51:57.534
Sewon!

51:57.618 --> 51:59.244
Sewon, wake up now!

51:59.328 --> 52:01.538
Sewon, wake up! Sewon!

52:06.668 --> 52:09.379
Turn off the switches,
or we're all going to die!

52:11.089 --> 52:13.592
We have to leave now. Right now.

52:16.553 --> 52:18.388
Doyoon, please stop.

52:18.472 --> 52:21.433
Doyoon? It's going to be okay.

52:22.976 --> 52:24.353
I'll wait here.

52:47.584 --> 52:48.418
It's all right.

52:52.589 --> 52:53.549
Jaeyi.

52:58.095 --> 52:59.179
I think Doyoon is...

53:01.431 --> 53:02.975
afraid of me.

53:05.519 --> 53:06.603
No.

53:08.647 --> 53:12.651
Doyoon is hiding in his own world,

53:13.861 --> 53:15.237
just like you used to.

53:19.449 --> 53:21.618
Let him know that his dad is here.

53:21.702 --> 53:23.412
So he can feel safe.

53:24.246 --> 53:25.205
How?

53:27.040 --> 53:27.958
There was

53:29.042 --> 53:31.587
a song that I used to sing to him.

53:32.588 --> 53:34.256
Why don't we try that?

53:38.468 --> 53:43.223
Mother, sister

53:43.307 --> 53:47.269
Let's live by the river

53:48.562 --> 53:53.483
Where the golden sand

53:53.567 --> 53:57.362
Dazzles in the yard

53:58.947 --> 54:03.577
Fallen leaves sing

54:03.660 --> 54:07.497
Outside the back door

54:08.832 --> 54:13.712
Mother, sister

54:13.795 --> 54:17.883
Let's live by the river

54:22.930 --> 54:24.515
Just wait.

55:07.307 --> 55:08.225
Doyoon, come here.

55:18.235 --> 55:19.611
Come here, Doyoon.

55:27.536 --> 55:28.745
I'm so sorry.

55:29.663 --> 55:31.248
I'm sorry.

55:42.718 --> 55:43.677
Are you okay?

55:52.978 --> 55:53.979
Thank you so much...

55:57.399 --> 55:59.443
for keeping your promise.

56:05.073 --> 56:08.869
Sewon, wake up!

56:14.208 --> 56:15.209
Sewon!

56:16.210 --> 56:17.419
Sewon!

56:18.045 --> 56:19.588
Sewon!

56:20.797 --> 56:22.925
Doyoon, we have to go now.

56:23.342 --> 56:26.136
Are you ready? Come on.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.403
Sewon! Sewon!

56:43.487 --> 56:45.447
We have to go now! Sewon!

56:45.989 --> 56:47.824
Sewon!

56:47.908 --> 56:50.369
- Doyoon!
- Sewon, we have to go right now!

56:50.452 --> 56:52.204
- Doyoon!
- Sewon!

56:52.287 --> 56:55.457
The equipment isn't responding!
It's malfunctioning!

57:00.420 --> 57:02.130
Go over there
and turn off the main switch!

57:13.684 --> 57:15.477
Doyoon!

57:21.441 --> 57:22.442
Open the door!

57:25.529 --> 57:26.530
Doyoon!

57:28.490 --> 57:30.534
It's not working!

57:31.159 --> 57:32.369
Sewon...

57:47.217 --> 57:48.218
Namil...

57:49.178 --> 57:50.345
Sewon...

57:50.429 --> 57:51.346
Go ahead.

57:52.139 --> 57:53.140
Get out of here!

57:54.099 --> 57:56.435
Sewon...

58:47.277 --> 58:48.487
Sewon...

59:06.505 --> 59:07.714
Sewon...

59:10.050 --> 59:11.176
Sewon...

59:29.319 --> 59:30.153
Doyoon...

59:33.824 --> 59:34.825
Doyoon.

59:37.619 --> 59:38.745
Doyoon.

59:39.329 --> 59:40.247
Doyoon!

59:41.540 --> 59:42.541
Doyoon!

59:44.501 --> 59:45.544
Doyoon.

59:51.717 --> 59:53.135
Dad...

59:55.846 --> 59:57.306
Yes, it's me.

59:57.890 --> 1:00:00.017
It's Dad! It's Dad!

1:00:01.518 --> 1:00:02.728
Thank you.

1:00:04.438 --> 1:00:05.439
Thank you...

1:00:07.316 --> 1:00:09.067
Thank you, Doyoon.

1:00:41.225 --> 1:00:43.477
Dr. Myung...

1:01:22.224 --> 1:01:23.350
You all right?

1:01:25.018 --> 1:01:26.979
Took you long enough.

1:01:27.062 --> 1:01:29.314
I came as soon as I heard, kid.

1:01:31.191 --> 1:01:34.152
Take a few days off,
then come back when you're ready.

1:01:36.238 --> 1:01:37.406
Yes, sir. I will.

1:01:38.907 --> 1:01:40.284
All right, let's hurry it up!

1:01:52.671 --> 1:01:54.756
We've arrested all the suspects.

1:01:55.340 --> 1:01:57.593
- Take them.
- Yes, ma'am.

1:02:20.490 --> 1:02:22.993
Is Doyoon okay?

1:02:24.244 --> 1:02:26.079
Yes. He's alright.

1:02:27.331 --> 1:02:28.457
It's over now.

1:02:31.210 --> 1:02:33.962
Yes, it is. It's over.

1:03:37.025 --> 1:03:40.362
JAEYI JUNG, WE WAIT FOR THE DAY
WHEN WE SHALL MEET AGAIN

1:03:48.078 --> 1:03:50.789
Doyoon, say hi to Mommy.

1:05:26.969 --> 1:05:28.470
Sewon Koh speaking.

1:05:28.929 --> 1:05:31.598
Juhyun Yoon has been on the run,
but we figured out his next move.

1:05:32.182 --> 1:05:34.101
We found his passport broker
through the black market.

1:05:34.768 --> 1:05:35.894
You have to catch him.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:39.273
Yoon attempted to murder my wife.

1:05:40.023 --> 1:05:41.316
You have to catch him.

1:05:42.150 --> 1:05:45.445
Right now, our team is going
to their rendezvous point.

1:05:45.529 --> 1:05:47.197
I'll get back to you.

1:05:47.281 --> 1:05:48.490
Okay.

1:06:42.252 --> 1:06:43.086
Who's there?

1:06:46.882 --> 1:06:48.008
Who are you?

1:06:56.433 --> 1:06:58.101
Sewon...

1:07:03.815 --> 1:07:06.193
There you are.
