00:02.335 --> 00:04.103
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:04.105 --> 00:05.537
I'm worried this collin thing

00:05.539 --> 00:06.971
Might be more
than just a fantasy.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.907
- You've read
jenna's paper, right?

00:08.909 --> 00:10.709
- There were no names,
no specifics,

00:10.711 --> 00:13.612
And no way anyone could
figure out it was about collin.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.982
- I read your paper.
You need to come over.

00:18.618 --> 00:21.120
- With delusions of desire
for collin put to bed,

00:21.122 --> 00:22.154
In the bed of my head,

00:22.156 --> 00:25.491
I was free and clear to let
my conscience take a rest.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.793
Collin had a girlfriend.
I had a boyfriend.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.696
And we could just go
about our business

00:30.698 --> 00:33.198
As casual classmates.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.333
- ♪ by now

00:34.335 --> 00:35.868
♪ a strange love

00:35.870 --> 00:37.202
- I have something for you.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.172
- Apparently his flirtation
was not laid to rest,

00:40.174 --> 00:43.208
And I had to redefine
appropriate boundaries.

00:43.210 --> 00:47.479
What collin needed
was a subtle hint.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.215
Or a strong suggestion.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.850
[bell rings]

00:51.852 --> 00:53.118
- Jenna, hold up.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.686
- What?

00:54.688 --> 00:55.487
- This is for you.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.523
- No.
I can't take it.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.023
- Why not?

00:58.025 --> 00:59.925
- Do I need
to spell it out for you?

00:59.927 --> 01:00.559
- Yes.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.727
- Stop with the sexy notes,

01:01.729 --> 01:03.162
The eyelashes, the whispers,
and the touches.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.131
I know what you're doing,
and it's not appropriate.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.900
There's obviously
some chemistry between us,

01:07.902 --> 01:11.236
But I am in a relationship,
and so are you.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.872
- May I?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.815
This is an invitation
to an open house

01:22.817 --> 01:27.186
For that photographer that
you liked, elisabeth caren.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.454
Sexy notes.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.522
You're hilarious.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.658
- And an idiot.

01:32.660 --> 01:36.161
[typing]

01:36.163 --> 01:37.496
- The party's on Friday.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.731
It would be awesome
to have you there.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.968
Show my parents I actually
made new friends.

01:42.970 --> 01:46.305
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.980
I hope you guys
can make it on Friday.

01:54.982 --> 01:59.384
In the meantime,
have a good thanksgiving.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.053
- You too.

02:01.055 --> 02:01.653
- What was that?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.188
- Oh, collin invited us
to a party

02:03.190 --> 02:05.591
For that photographer we liked
at his girlfriend's house.

02:05.593 --> 02:10.062
- But Friday is the julies'
annual black Friday party.

02:10.064 --> 02:12.764
Why not go to both?
You can do that.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.600
- Yes, yes, I can.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.701
Done.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.103
There, we are r.S.V.P.'d.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.004
- We?

02:19.006 --> 02:20.305
No, I don't wanna go.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.441
- I can't go alone.
- Why not?

02:22.443 --> 02:23.876
- There were
a million reasons.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.978
Come on, we can go
early to collin's

02:25.980 --> 02:28.847
And show up fashionably late
to the next one.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.582
Please.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.116
- Okay.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.252
- Everyone, pull out your phones
and get ready to flip.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.755
It is all about to go down
in three, two...

02:36.757 --> 02:37.456
[phones chime]

02:37.458 --> 02:41.193
- Ah, we're invited
to the after mall ball.

02:41.195 --> 02:41.927
What is that?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.395
- T.B.E.
Scroll to the hosts.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.931
- "hosted by julie, julie,
and tamara."

02:45.933 --> 02:47.966
- You're throwing a party
with the julies?

02:47.968 --> 02:48.834
- Yes, I replaced sadie,

02:48.836 --> 02:50.536
And technically
it's julie and tessa

02:50.538 --> 02:52.504
Because the other julie--
all: Which julie?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.539
- The julie that went
to rehab.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.307
Tessa looks
like rehab julie,

02:55.309 --> 02:56.441
So everyone started
calling her "julie,"

02:56.443 --> 02:58.010
And she just went with it
because it's easier that way.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.012
- How'd that happen?
- I don't know, she's easygoing.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.380
- No, how did you get
to host the party?

03:01.382 --> 03:03.782
- Well, the black Friday party,
the b.F.P.,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.350
Was getting confused
with the mafia's

03:05.352 --> 03:06.552
Black hearts party, b.H.P.,

03:06.554 --> 03:07.853
And too many asians
were showing up.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.990
So I pitched calling the party
the after mall ball, the a.M.B.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.659
The julies loved
the new name so much,

03:13.661 --> 03:14.893
They made me co-host.

03:14.895 --> 03:15.794
I've been anointed.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.995
- And I think I have been too.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.530
Something weird is happening.
- What do you mean?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.499
- It all started when
I got to school this morning.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.267
I was looking
for a place to park,

03:22.269 --> 03:24.736
And then suddenly
for the first time,

03:24.738 --> 03:28.106
I was waved
into a prime spot

03:28.108 --> 03:30.209
With my name on it.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.310
As I got out of my sonic,

03:31.312 --> 03:35.380
I was handed
a specialty latte.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.715
Vanilla mocha half caf with--

03:36.717 --> 03:38.917
- A splash of splenda?
That's your fave.

03:38.919 --> 03:39.518
- No [bleep].

03:39.520 --> 03:42.120
But that isn't even
the freakiest part.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.590
Watch.

03:48.127 --> 03:51.830
I was just snapping.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.202
I have no idea
what's going on!

03:57.204 --> 03:58.370
- What is going on?

03:58.372 --> 04:01.740
Tamara is co-hosting?
This has got to be a joke.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.274
- Or a mistake.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.508
Maybe they left your name off
by accident.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.077
- They probably
don't know this went out,

04:05.079 --> 04:09.815
And when they see it, they are
going to have a conniption.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.051
Julie, julie,
I just got an invitation

04:13.053 --> 04:15.787
To the black Friday party,
which I assume was bootlegged

04:15.789 --> 04:18.523
Since there were
some glaring errors.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.057
- Like what?

04:19.059 --> 04:20.858
- Well, in addition
to the stupid new title,

04:20.861 --> 04:23.428
I noticed that some freak
of nature added her name.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.599
I would be more than happy
to send out a retraction.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.700
You're welcome.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.568
- Not necessary.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.370
- The party needed
to be reinvented,

04:31.372 --> 04:32.771
So we made some changes.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.340
- And left me out?
- Yes.

04:35.342 --> 04:39.011
- Explain.

04:39.013 --> 04:39.745
Please.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.746
- It's simple.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.247
You can't help us anymore,

04:42.249 --> 04:44.316
'cause a bitch without money
is just a bitch.

04:44.318 --> 04:48.553
- And we don't need any help
in that department.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.192
- Good job
on the mass text.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.127
- Thank you.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.561
- Don't thank us.
Not yet.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.363
- You're still going
to need to get us

04:58.365 --> 05:00.198
Everything on this list
by early Friday,

05:00.200 --> 05:01.600
So we have time
to set up.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.136
- Tomorrow's thanksgiving.
- And your point is?

05:04.138 --> 05:07.839
- I have a lot
of work tonight.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.343
Come on,
let's get this done.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.345
- You really should add
one more thing to that list.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.714
- What?
- Some balls.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.516
[alternative music]

05:17.518 --> 05:18.483
- Thanksgiving was over,

05:18.485 --> 05:20.585
And I was still stuffed
with gratitude.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.488
My appetite for food
and my boyfriend had returned,

05:23.490 --> 05:26.925
And suddenly my Friday
didn't seem so black.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.293
[laughter]

05:28.295 --> 05:28.994
- It was amazing.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.129
- That was the most
exhilarating 11 hours

05:31.131 --> 05:33.365
I've ever spent in a mall
without being on a toilet.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.934
They've made a lot of leaps
in I.B.S. Medication.

05:35.936 --> 05:39.204
- It's all about going early
and with the proper preparation.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.339
The leotards
get you in and out

05:40.341 --> 05:42.307
Without pit stops
to the dressing rooms.

05:42.309 --> 05:45.310
And the pads keep you
from pit stops to the e.R.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.880
- L dog, we gotta show our girl
our tag team maneuver.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.881
- Ah!

05:49.883 --> 05:51.717
- Here we go.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.451
- Yep.

05:52.453 --> 05:57.923
- Now imagine this
one-of-a-kind afghan sweater

05:57.925 --> 06:00.192
Is just dangling
out in the open

06:00.194 --> 06:02.227
Near a frenzy
of rabid whores.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.995
For whatever reason,
they don't notice it

06:03.997 --> 06:06.365
Until you got to it,
grabbed it, and then--

06:06.367 --> 06:10.869
- Someone is on top of you,
taking the ugly--

06:10.871 --> 06:11.737
- Trendsetting.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.138
- Acquired tasteful garb

06:13.140 --> 06:14.539
Out of your hand.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.307
What do you do?

06:15.309 --> 06:16.541
You call in your teammate.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.809
- [blows whistle]

06:17.811 --> 06:19.077
- Hut!

06:19.079 --> 06:20.178
[both grunt]

06:20.180 --> 06:21.079
Yeah.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.748
[both grunting]

06:22.750 --> 06:23.915
It was magic.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.584
And I got some loot
for you too.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.552
- Anything
I could wear tonight?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.420
- Totes, your mom scored you

06:28.422 --> 06:32.657
A ton of your standard
snooze fest fashion.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.693
[pop music]

06:34.695 --> 06:36.928
- Oh, I bought that for me.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.998
- What she's trying to say is,
"it's too slutty."

06:40.000 --> 06:40.599
- Ahh.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.467
No, what I'm trying to say

06:42.469 --> 06:45.971
Is that it feels
a little mature.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.607
- Would you mind?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.775
- I wanna make a statement.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.309
- 200 bucks
is a statement.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.344
Spending a thousand
is stupid.

06:52.346 --> 06:56.014
- It was worth every hour
of the last year of baby-sitting

06:56.016 --> 06:56.882
To solidify my new status.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.283
Plus I don't have
to save for a car anymore

06:58.285 --> 06:59.951
Now that I have you
to drive me around.

06:59.953 --> 07:00.519
- Oh, thanks.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.586
- There are
only two bags of ice!

07:01.588 --> 07:03.021
- That's all they had
at the store.

07:03.023 --> 07:03.989
- The list said
a minimum of ten.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.023
You have to go
to another store.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.024
- You said to set up
the tables.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.759
- You can do that
after you change your shirt.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.094
You're looking sweaty.

07:09.096 --> 07:09.761
- Because I am.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.829
I've been doing
all of your dirty work.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.031
- This isn't dirty work.
It's fun.

07:13.033 --> 07:13.565
Just go change.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.301
I'll have jenna bring some ice
on her way over.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.969
Go! Now!

07:17.971 --> 07:20.439
Have fun!

07:20.441 --> 07:21.006
[line ringing]

07:21.008 --> 07:22.641
- Hey.
- Could you grab some ice?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.543
- Uh, we just got
to collin's,

07:24.545 --> 07:26.478
But we can pick up
some ice after we leave.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.548
- No, I need it now!
Damn it!

07:31.117 --> 07:32.617
- Jake texted me
the same request.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.285
Call tamara back.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.953
Tell her we can have ice there
in 30 minutes.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.354
- 30 minutes?
- We'll stop into collin's,

07:36.356 --> 07:37.989
We'll take a loop,
and then we'll hit the road.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.125
- We can't just stay
for 30 minutes. It's rude.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.259
- How long does it take
to look at pictures?

07:41.261 --> 07:44.129
- Photographs, and we can't
just walk in and walk out.

07:44.131 --> 07:48.467
- You go.
I'll pick you up later.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.670
- Get back in?

07:53.239 --> 07:53.905
I said you were coming,

07:53.907 --> 07:55.340
And if you don't,
you'll embarrass me.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.977
- I'll embarrass you in front
of who, people you don't know?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.045
- Yes, don't be
an ass[bleep].

08:00.047 --> 08:01.713
- Why not? You want me to go
into a house full of them.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.015
- Admit it, you're afraid
you'll sound stupid

08:04.017 --> 08:05.684
And embarrass yourself.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.185
- Why are you being
so bitchy?

08:07.187 --> 08:08.320
- Because you're
embarrassing me,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.856
And I have never
embarrassed you.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.490
- Oh, really?

08:11.492 --> 08:12.591
What about the start

you tried to kill yourself?

08:14.228 --> 08:15.227
- I didn't try
to kill myself.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.028
- I know that now,
but I didn't know that then.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.563
I thought maybe
it was because of me.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.065
- You? Why you?

08:20.067 --> 08:21.132
- Because you had
your accident

The same day
we slept together.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.368
How do you think
that [bleep] with my head?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.070
You didn't even try
to explain it to me.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.539
Instead you
obsessively stared at me

08:27.541 --> 08:28.440
From a distance for weeks.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.374
What was I
supposed to think?

08:29.376 --> 08:30.709
- You didn't want
to be seen with me.

08:30.711 --> 08:34.446
- 'cause I was mortified.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.883
- You said you were
never embarrassed of me.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.085
- I lied.

08:40.087 --> 08:45.590

I died inside.

[gentle music]

08:48.896 --> 08:52.898

that came out wrong.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.566
- You lied to me?

08:54.568 --> 08:55.634
- I didn't want to.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.768
I was just embarrassed

08:56.770 --> 08:58.637
Of how insecure
and stupid I was.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.905
I never wanted you
to know, jenna.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.774
You know me.
You know how I feel.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.341
- But did I?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.477
Suddenly my own feelings
on the matter

09:05.479 --> 09:06.678
Were missing in action.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.479
- I'm frustrated.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.714
I didn't even want
to go to collin's.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.549
I just came here for you.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.017
Sometimes it feels like
all I'm doing

09:12.019 --> 09:14.386
Is making amends
for how we started.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.854
- So now this is my fault?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.188
- No, no, it's my fault.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.190
I'm the one who made a point
to focus on you,

09:19.192 --> 09:23.161
To make sure you felt
secure and significant.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.731
In the process, sometimes
you make me feel insignificant.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.465
- How?

09:27.467 --> 09:31.503
- When have you ever asked
how I'm doing with my parents?

09:31.505 --> 09:32.938
It was really hard
for me, jenna,

09:32.940 --> 09:35.273
And you never checked in.
