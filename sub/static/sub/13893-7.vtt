WEBVTT

00:14.505 --> 00:15.715
What now?

00:15.745 --> 00:17.415
Look, we're working. See!

00:17.485 --> 00:20.235
Yeah, we're never gonna get done if you keep checking up on us!

00:20.345 --> 00:21.975
Pay day, fellas.

00:22.345 --> 00:23.825
Aww, nice!

00:23.835 --> 00:26.585
My favorite day of the every other week!

00:26.925 --> 00:27.855
Here.

00:29.175 --> 00:31.005
What, you don't like getting paid?

00:31.005 --> 00:34.595
No, I'm just getting tired of the old sandwich-baggie full of coins.

00:34.595 --> 00:36.515
Why can't we get a check like normal people?

00:36.515 --> 00:37.795
Skips gets checks!

00:37.795 --> 00:40.475
Skips has a bank account and a 401k.

00:40.585 --> 00:42.555
Well, at least give us the coins in an envelope

00:42.555 --> 00:44.145
or something more respectable,

00:44.225 --> 00:45.705
'cause this is degrading.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.235
I need to get out of here.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.545
What's his deal? He doesn't respect us at all!

00:54.545 --> 00:56.255
Yeah, well that's his problem, right?

00:56.255 --> 00:57.735
We're respectable people!

00:58.545 --> 01:00.545
- Outta the way! - Losers!

01:00.565 --> 01:02.215
What the heck, man, watch it!

01:03.895 --> 01:05.685
See man, it's not just Benson,

01:05.715 --> 01:07.305
people just don't respect us!

01:07.305 --> 01:08.965
Well, we could buy people's respect.

01:08.965 --> 01:10.135
Nah, too expensive.

01:10.925 --> 01:13.405
People respect people who are good at things.

01:16.505 --> 01:18.015
Margaret, what's going on?

01:18.105 --> 01:21.385
The manager installed this new arcade game to keep the customers around.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.995
There kids are amazing at it, you should see 'em!

01:25.015 --> 01:26.445
Dude, it's those kids!

01:26.455 --> 01:27.765
Hey, hey you!

01:27.765 --> 01:28.525
What!?

01:28.525 --> 01:31.155
When you knock people over, you have to say you're sorry!

01:31.155 --> 01:33.105
You guys need to learn some respect.

01:33.105 --> 01:34.435
Respect our butts!

01:34.435 --> 01:36.215
No, you respect our butts!

01:36.215 --> 01:37.705
What are you guys doing!?

01:37.705 --> 01:40.525
Those kids practically killed us with their skateboards outside.

01:40.745 --> 01:42.625
So!? They're kids!

01:42.625 --> 01:44.585
What are you going to do, beat them up or something?

01:44.585 --> 01:48.195
No, but I am gonna kick their butts at this video game.

01:49.785 --> 01:51.155
I got next.

01:51.155 --> 01:52.335
Nice baggie,

01:52.385 --> 01:55.075
must've been sad when you break open your piggy bank.

01:57.925 --> 01:59.715
Seven-hundred thousand!

02:00.315 --> 02:02.495
TRD, turd.

02:02.885 --> 02:03.595
Nice!

02:05.295 --> 02:06.965
Beat that, gramps.

02:06.965 --> 02:08.895
Gramps? I'm in my 20s.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.035
Yeah, 1920s.

02:11.565 --> 02:12.825
Just move.

02:18.415 --> 02:20.405
How do you get negative points?

02:20.405 --> 02:22.045
How is that even possible?

02:22.045 --> 02:24.335
It was the first time I ever played that stupid game!

02:24.335 --> 02:25.225
Give me a break!

02:25.225 --> 02:27.365
I'm just saying, you made us look like chumps, man.

02:28.275 --> 02:29.365
Look at 'em.

02:29.365 --> 02:31.995
You guys really handed it to those losers.

02:31.995 --> 02:34.195
Free donuts for the champs!

02:37.315 --> 02:38.905
All right, we're outta here.

02:40.095 --> 02:41.575
Weren't they amazing?

02:42.565 --> 02:46.215
I can't believe we were so enthralled by a video game, but we were!

02:46.885 --> 02:49.525
I told you people respect you when you're good at something.

02:49.525 --> 02:51.405
And we're gonna get the respect we deserve

02:51.395 --> 02:53.165
by getting good at that game.

02:54.705 --> 02:56.765
Okay, Broken Bonez.

02:56.865 --> 02:58.655
So are you trying to get broken bones?

02:58.655 --> 02:59.785
Dude, c'mon, no,

02:59.785 --> 03:03.005
you just gotta go off these jumps and land without breaking your bones.

03:04.175 --> 03:05.595
Alright, I think I got it.

03:05.595 --> 03:06.845
Here, gimme a shot.

03:11.705 --> 03:13.185
Woah, how'd you do that?

03:13.185 --> 03:14.975
I dunno, that's what those kids were doing.

03:14.975 --> 03:16.695
Here, you do the joystick and I'll do the buttons.

03:16.695 --> 03:18.245
Just go crazy when we're in the air.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.035
Wow, another 500!

03:21.185 --> 03:22.595
Aww sweet!

03:22.595 --> 03:24.765
Aww, well not bad, not bad.

03:24.965 --> 03:26.775
You guys got some skill.

03:26.865 --> 03:29.555
Some? What do you mean some?

03:33.515 --> 03:35.795
C'mon, Jack Farley!

03:36.815 --> 03:37.855
Dangit!

03:37.925 --> 03:40.765
Well, I gotta hand it to you guys.

03:40.765 --> 03:42.765
You play better than you look.

03:42.815 --> 03:44.025
- Okay? - Thanks.

03:44.065 --> 03:46.555
Stop by the office sometime if you wanna hang.

03:46.555 --> 03:47.625
No charge.

03:48.625 --> 03:49.825
Yeah, Jack Farley?

03:50.045 --> 03:52.475
No! I said cell two, two!

03:52.835 --> 03:54.225
What was that all about?

03:55.025 --> 03:56.815
Respect!

03:56.815 --> 03:58.175
Let's get some more.

03:58.175 --> 03:59.675
Mordecai, Rigby, come in!

03:59.675 --> 04:01.015
Aww man, it's Benson.

04:01.055 --> 04:03.445
Yeah, uh, hey Benson. What's up?

04:03.445 --> 04:07.075
I need you guys to clean the bathrooms back at the house ASAP!

04:07.075 --> 04:08.785
Uh, we're on our lunch break.

04:08.855 --> 04:11.525
Look, if you guys aren't back in two minutes,

04:11.515 --> 04:12.505
you're fired!

04:12.505 --> 04:13.125
Gimme that!

04:13.125 --> 04:15.595
We deserve more respect than this, Benson.

04:15.595 --> 04:18.685
Maybe when you realize that we'll come back to work.

04:18.815 --> 04:20.265
Rigby, Mordecai!

04:20.365 --> 04:21.464
Respect!

04:59.535 --> 05:02.225
Oh look, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. negative points!

05:02.225 --> 05:04.815
Guess we'll have to beat you two losers again.

05:04.815 --> 05:07.455
Well, why don't you two come over here and try, then?

05:07.455 --> 05:09.315
You got yourselves a rematch.

05:39.785 --> 05:41.415
Aww man!

05:41.595 --> 05:43.875
All right, you guys are good.

05:44.045 --> 05:45.095
Thanks.

05:45.225 --> 05:47.095
Woah, you guys are really good!

05:47.145 --> 05:49.015
You're close to beating the high score!

05:49.015 --> 05:50.015
Woah, we are?

05:51.475 --> 05:53.345
Wait, who holds the high score?

05:53.345 --> 05:56.705
Some dude named GBF, but it's not just a high score,

05:56.705 --> 05:57.955
it's the world record.

05:57.955 --> 05:58.765
Thanks,

05:58.775 --> 06:01.205
now I can follow along and feel invested!

06:01.235 --> 06:02.625
Go for it, guys!

06:28.185 --> 06:31.195
So you've broken the world record, have you?

06:31.195 --> 06:33.405
Yeah, who's askin'?

06:33.455 --> 06:34.475
Me.

06:36.575 --> 06:38.865
It's a giant bearded face!

06:39.465 --> 06:40.795
GBF!

06:40.795 --> 06:42.645
Yeah, I'm GBF all right,

06:42.675 --> 06:46.925
but it stands for Garrett Bobby Ferguson, not giant bearded face.

06:46.925 --> 06:49.155
You're not mad at us for breaking your world record, are you?

06:49.675 --> 06:51.155
It's no big deal.

06:51.275 --> 06:54.075
Not like it's the universe record or anything important.

06:54.225 --> 06:55.835
Universe record?

06:55.895 --> 06:58.245
It's the highest score in the whole universe,

06:58.295 --> 07:01.785
1,279,001.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.915
Now who holds that record again?

07:04.735 --> 07:05.675
Me!

07:07.055 --> 07:08.585
Yes, go ahead,

07:08.595 --> 07:11.865
stroke the beard of Garrett Bobby Ferguson.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.865
Hey, giant beardo face!

07:13.865 --> 07:16.045
I told you that's not my name!

07:16.045 --> 07:18.965
Look, we're gonna settle this right now.

07:18.965 --> 07:22.025
Us verses you in a head to head match.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.295
Fine! One game for the universe record.

07:25.295 --> 07:27.935
Winner gets all the respect.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.175
Let's play.

08:22.995 --> 08:25.065
Dude, why're you crying, dude?

08:25.065 --> 08:27.595
Please, please just let me win!

08:27.595 --> 08:29.235
Dude, what are you talking about?

08:29.305 --> 08:33.235
I've devoted my entire life to Broken Bonez.

08:33.405 --> 08:36.164
I played so much my wife left me.

08:36.195 --> 08:38.125
- Ding! - Geez.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.405
So you're asking us to throw the game?

08:40.405 --> 08:44.164
Please, the universe record is all I have!

08:44.164 --> 08:45.505
What do you think, man?

08:45.505 --> 08:46.605
No way!

08:46.645 --> 08:48.995
Nobody's gonna respect us if we wuss out now!

08:53.085 --> 08:54.735
It's not wussing out, man.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.725
It's called doing the right thing.

08:57.425 --> 08:58.255
Fine.

08:58.315 --> 09:00.575
Okay dude, we'll let you have it.

09:03.465 --> 09:05.085
Thank you so much!

09:08.455 --> 09:11.325
Thank you for being so dumb!

09:11.395 --> 09:12.225
What!?

09:12.225 --> 09:14.795
I didn't devote my life to this cruddy game,

09:14.795 --> 09:16.205
it's just a hobby.

09:16.315 --> 09:17.605
But what about your wife?

09:17.885 --> 09:19.325
Never had one!

09:19.325 --> 09:21.595
You can't tie GBF down!

09:21.775 --> 09:23.665
You can't do that, that's cheating!

09:23.665 --> 09:25.375
Universe rules, baby.

09:25.415 --> 09:27.365
There are no rules.

09:28.275 --> 09:29.585
Oh, boo yourselves!

09:29.595 --> 09:31.405
I'm Garrett Bobby Ferguson.

09:31.565 --> 09:33.295
Aww, this blows!

09:33.295 --> 09:35.385
We gotta do something before he beats our score!

09:35.385 --> 09:36.915
No rules, right?

09:37.945 --> 09:39.805
Mess up, c'mon, mess up!

09:39.805 --> 09:42.205
You know you want some broken bones.

09:42.205 --> 09:44.015
Broken bones!

09:44.015 --> 09:46.015
Broken bones!

09:46.035 --> 09:48.395
Broken bones! Broken bones!

09:48.685 --> 09:50.135
No!

09:54.095 --> 09:55.315
It doesn't matter,

09:55.375 --> 09:58.065
I've already beat your score and taken the title

09:58.065 --> 10:00.275
and I'm never coming back!

10:03.265 --> 10:05.105
Wait, the game's still going!

10:05.105 --> 10:05.885
Huh?

10:07.325 --> 10:09.045
No, it can't be!

10:09.045 --> 10:10.575
C'mon, c'mon!

10:15.245 --> 10:16.095
Get off!

10:19.645 --> 10:20.975
My Chin!

10:24.965 --> 10:26.885
NO!

10:31.915 --> 10:34.155
Great job, you did it!

10:36.095 --> 10:38.445
Oh, hey Benson, what're you doing here?

10:38.445 --> 10:40.385
I thought about what you guys said earlier

10:40.385 --> 10:42.975
and so I've come down to give you those checks you wanted.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.325
- Oh wow, thanks! - But...

10:44.325 --> 10:47.835
now that I'm covered in brain goo, I've realised my mistake.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.475
You wanna waste your lives playing video games,

10:50.475 --> 10:53.095
then fine, I respect your decision!

10:53.095 --> 10:55.965
Just don't ever do it on my time ever again!

10:57.925 --> 10:59.785
- I can respect that. - Yeah, that's cool.
