WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:14.305
I don't know. I guess
what I'm trying to tell you is I'm gay.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.731
I don't know what you want me
to say right now this moment.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.485
I mean, I'm not gonna kid you
that I'm a little shocked.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.904
-I wasn't planning on hearing that today.
-Yeah.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.993
I mean, I wanna talk to you about it,
but I don't know…

00:38.580 --> 00:40.415
When do you think you realized that?

00:40.498 --> 00:42.834
Like, I knew I was different
when I was six.

00:44.627 --> 00:48.214
And just growing up in our town
and growing up in football, like,

00:49.466 --> 00:51.634
being gay was never a good thing.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.763
Would people have looked at me,
back then, the same

00:54.846 --> 00:56.765
and awarded me with the accomplishments,

00:56.848 --> 00:59.309
or would I have just been
"the gay football player"?

01:01.019 --> 01:02.979
I mean, you were with me on draft day.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.149
-Yeah.
-Literally, Michael Sam got roasted.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.484
I could see that.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.863
I wish I could tell you you're not gonna
get hammered for this, but you are.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.031
And it's gonna suck.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.492
The thing is, since confronting it,

01:15.575 --> 01:18.036
it's the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.872
Like, the most I've ever…
Like, the best I've ever felt.

01:20.955 --> 01:24.125
So when did you confront it?
I mean, when did you really…

01:24.209 --> 01:27.462
When you just say it was the happiest
in your life, when was that?

01:28.755 --> 01:32.634
This sounds terrible but, like,
the day I got the restraining order on me…

01:33.134 --> 01:33.968
Yeah?

01:34.594 --> 01:38.098
…was when I, like, knew…
something had to change.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.894
I was so attached to a traditional life,
and, like, my straight relationship

01:42.977 --> 01:45.647
that I knew
she was my last straight relationship.

01:45.730 --> 01:50.735
And I didn't want to let that go 'cause
I didn't want to have to deal with this.

01:53.863 --> 01:57.325
You know that's not something
you have to run from us for, right?

01:58.827 --> 02:00.620
Our love is never gonna change for you.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.872
How we feel about you
is never gonna change.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.295
-I love you.
-I love you too.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.260
I feel like my dad's gonna…

02:15.343 --> 02:17.887
It's gonna take a little time
for him to process everything,

02:17.971 --> 02:20.265
but it just sort of
makes me feel a little guilty

02:20.348 --> 02:23.726
that I didn't trust him
with this earlier in my life.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.521
Well, this is a first
on a fishing trip.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.816
-Yeah.
-Bud, what do you want me to do?

02:29.899 --> 02:32.235
Do you want me
to take some of this for you?

02:32.318 --> 02:36.156
So that you don't…
'Cause this… this conversation, for you,

02:37.323 --> 02:41.161
is gonna get… I mean, it's not that
you're not gonna talk to people about it,

02:41.828 --> 02:43.329
but I think you just need to…

02:44.873 --> 02:45.832
I think you just…

02:45.915 --> 02:48.626
If you don't want to be
the one to tell some of them,

02:48.710 --> 02:50.712
I'm fine telling them. I'll talk to them.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.381
-If that helps.
-Yeah.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.134
I remember when I came back from LA,

02:56.217 --> 02:59.470
and I had to… tell them what happened and…

03:01.431 --> 03:03.266
go through all the public stuff.

03:05.018 --> 03:09.147
I've never talked to him about, um,
the suicide attempt.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.900
And I want to, it's just not right now.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.152
You know, I did push you.

03:14.235 --> 03:18.406
I don't want to say I pushed you…
I pushed you to be… to be a man,

03:18.489 --> 03:19.616
but I kind of did.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.118
That's kinda what I pushed,
but not just for that reason.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.413
I pushed you to be the best you could be
at anything you wanted to do.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.750
You know, as a dad,
it kind of crosses your mind of,

03:28.833 --> 03:31.878
especially when we raised him
the way we did, we were tough on him,

03:31.961 --> 03:36.341
was it too much or was it something
we should have backed off on? And, uh…

03:37.717 --> 03:40.720
he's my son
and, you know, means the world to me.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.103
I want you to lean on me,

03:49.187 --> 03:51.147
'cause this is something
that I didn't know

03:51.231 --> 03:53.107
when stuff came out through The Bachelor.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.319
I didn't know you were hurting so bad.
Please talk to me. I love you.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.695
And there's nothing…

03:57.779 --> 04:00.240
-I'm still so proud of you.
-Thank you.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.509
-What's up?
-What's up?

04:19.592 --> 04:21.678
-You guys know Shelby.
-Yep.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.057
So these guys know, obviously.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.475
-What's going on?
-Good, you?

04:27.558 --> 04:28.559
-What's up?
-What's up?

04:28.643 --> 04:30.228
Reese, Chase, and Ty.

04:30.311 --> 04:33.231
You guys wanna play a little ball?
Are you stretched, warmed up?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.817
Since coming out to my dad,

04:36.734 --> 04:40.196
I've since come out to a handful
of family members and friends,

04:40.280 --> 04:43.449
and I definitely feel like
being accepted from people

04:43.533 --> 04:46.119
that were in my athletic community
and my athletic life,

04:46.202 --> 04:47.412
not that it means more,

04:47.495 --> 04:50.748
but it sort of gives me
more confidence and more validation

04:50.832 --> 04:55.962
when, you know, an NFL player
and an old teammate of mine say,

04:56.587 --> 04:59.882
"It doesn't change a thing.
Still love you, dude." It means a lot.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.592
Set, hut!

05:02.593 --> 05:03.803
-Okay.
-Oh no!

05:03.886 --> 05:06.306
-Damn, Colt. Get him, Colt.
-Oh no!

05:06.389 --> 05:08.641
Oh no. Ahh!

05:10.268 --> 05:12.186
Right in the bread basket, baby.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.148
Shelby was a teammate of mine,

05:15.231 --> 05:17.692
not only in college
but also professionally.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.153
He still plays.
He plays for the Denver Broncos.

05:20.236 --> 05:24.657
Shelby and I have had
a really good friendship for a while now.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.745
It's been a crazy last few years
for… for everybody in our circle.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.581
Yeah, man. We've been through a lot.
I think it's funny.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.125
We came… came from Normal, Illinois,

05:34.208 --> 05:37.170
went to Oakland, California,
you know, to here, man.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.087
Crazy.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.425
I'm just happy you finally can
really start living your life.

05:42.508 --> 05:46.220
Still trying to figure out all, like, the…
'Cause I did get through my family--

05:46.304 --> 05:48.973
-Did you talk to them?
-Bro, my dad was awesome.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.683
My brother was amazing.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.310
And I'm headed back to Illinois.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.645
I'm gonna talk
to my high school football coach.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.606
I hated high school for many reasons.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.817
And one of them
was because I was gay and I didn't know…

06:00.318 --> 06:02.320
I didn't have anybody, really, to talk to.

06:02.403 --> 06:06.157
I mean, you know, the locker room
wasn't always the most, uh, welcoming.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.787
My next hurdle is my high school coach.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.374
Coach Crouch was
my high school football coach.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.459
He was also my second dad,

06:16.542 --> 06:19.962
and I think that's because
a player-coach relationship

06:20.046 --> 06:22.256
is somewhat of a parental role.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.260
But the most toxic parts
of the locker room

06:26.344 --> 06:29.472
were allowed by the coaches and the people

06:29.555 --> 06:32.308
who are supposed to be there
to look out for these kids.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.686
When I heard them be okay
with homophobic slurs

06:35.770 --> 06:39.607
or a joke
that had to do with homosexuality,

06:39.690 --> 06:41.776
it just drove me further into the closet.

06:41.859 --> 06:46.280
If I was gay, I would not have been
comfortable in an NFL locker room.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.865
Like, not… not at all.

06:47.949 --> 06:52.870
I mean, the thing with, like, Michael Sam,
too, is that was our draft class.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.958
And I don't know if you remember this,
but, like, I remember him getting drafted,

06:57.041 --> 06:59.085
him being on screen with his boyfriend,

06:59.168 --> 07:01.295
and then just getting ridiculed
for a week.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.131
I remember, 'cause everyone's like,

07:03.214 --> 07:05.800
"He shouldn't be
kissing his boyfriend on TV like that."

07:06.426 --> 07:08.928
You know 'cause you were
in a different locker room than him too.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.180
Everybody's like, "He's being supported."

07:11.264 --> 07:13.433
I was like, "Come to my locker room."

07:13.516 --> 07:15.726
"He ain't being supported
in my locker room."

07:16.811 --> 07:19.522
I think that was
the frustrating part about it.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.567
I was just frustrated for him,
obviously, as a closeted gay,

07:22.650 --> 07:26.112
but it was like one of those things
'cause, like, I couldn't say shit.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.697
'Cause if I would say shit, people…

07:27.780 --> 07:30.575
What would the first person, if I would
be like, "Don't make fun of him"?

07:30.658 --> 07:31.868
They would call you gay.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.996
What Michael Sam did should have
given other players in the league

07:35.079 --> 07:38.249
an opportunity to come out
and to not be afraid.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.376
Unfortunately, I didn't reach out to him,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.336
and I didn't stick up for him
in the locker room.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.797
So, you know,
I was part of the problem as well.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.800
I felt like I was really
letting him down in that moment.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.846
My thing, yeah, as a player, I was--
You know me, I don't really give a shit.

07:51.929 --> 07:56.434
But… you have some very ignorant people
in the locker room.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.437
Your sexual orientation shouldn't matter.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.564
We're trying to talk about doing a job.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.525
I always say, there's always, probably,

08:04.609 --> 08:07.111
at least one gay person
in every locker room.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.779
But you just don't know about it.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.074
The sport of football
definitely has a long way to go

08:12.158 --> 08:14.911
with accepting an out gay player.

08:14.994 --> 08:19.874
The stereotype of gay men
in football is, like, soft and weak.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.793
And I'm sitting here like,
"You can go check my tape."

08:22.877 --> 08:24.128
"It wasn't any of those."

08:24.212 --> 08:26.005
I wasn't out. I was still gay.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.549
Didn't change anything.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.636
But you know you're my dawg.
You always gonna be my guy, you know.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.471
-Yeah.
-That doesn't change anything.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.557
I'm happy you're finally happy.
I'm happy you can finally be yourself.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.351
-That's really all that matters.
-Yep.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.728
Can you sleep at night
with a smile on your face?

08:40.811 --> 08:42.813
-Yeah.
-That's all that matters then, man.

08:56.118 --> 08:59.455
Oh! See? You're not as bad
as you think you are.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.790
No, it's nice actually.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.918
Part of the reason I hang out
with you is to make myself look better.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.337
-Cool. So now I know your real motives.
-Yeah.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.547
How's things been?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.173
-Things have been well.
-Good.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.133
-How have you been?
-Good.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.221
I think that in a lot of ways
I'm a great resource for Colton

09:15.304 --> 09:18.724
because I've been out for a few years
and we do have similar stories,

09:18.808 --> 09:21.811
but at the end of the day,
Colton grew up playing team sports.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.605
Team sports have a completely different
locker room dynamic.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.233
There are other people
who have had a similar experience

09:27.316 --> 09:31.028
and certainly could help weigh in
on his struggle and offer advice.

09:31.112 --> 09:35.032
And so I invited some gay ex-NFL players

09:35.116 --> 09:37.577
to come play golf with us today
and talk to Colton a little bit.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.538
Hopefully they can
swing a club better than us.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.415
-Boys.
-Great! Hello there!

09:42.498 --> 09:44.041
Hey. Colton.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.794
-Colton? How you doing?
-Yeah. Nice to meet you, man.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.422
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Good. Nice to see you.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.382
-What's up?
-Michael. Nice to meet you.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.300
-What up?
-Hey.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.427
One thing that I'm noticing is

09:54.510 --> 09:58.180
the gay community definitely knows
how to have each other's backs,

09:58.264 --> 10:01.309
and they're always there for each other,
and they're, if anything,

10:01.392 --> 10:06.355
going out of their way to make sure
that you know that you're not alone.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.774
And that, to me, is pretty special.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.987
David Kopay was the first player
to come out, after he retired.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.699
He played in the league from 1964 to 1972.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.161
Esera came out after he was playing too,
and he played in the '90s,

10:20.244 --> 10:23.664
and he even made it to the Super Bowl
with the Atlanta Falcons.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.376
And then Michael Sam,
who was in the same draft class as I was,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.963
was the first openly gay football player
to be drafted.

10:33.090 --> 10:37.136
-Were you on the Bachelor show?
-I dabbled in it for a few seasons.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.221
Did you get any dates
or anything out of it?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.641
Yep! I dated 30 women at one time.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.684
-No guys?
-No.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.019
-No!

10:46.395 --> 10:47.605
All right, let's do it!

10:48.648 --> 10:49.940
-There you go!
-All right!

10:50.024 --> 10:52.985
-Uh, can somebody put that… Just kidding.
-Oh my God!

10:53.069 --> 10:55.446
-Oh no, no. Please, Esera…
-Yeah!

10:56.947 --> 10:59.867
-I think you hit that plane right there.
-Yeah.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.996
So were you…
were you out when you were playing?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.748
Only in my later years was I…

11:05.831 --> 11:08.125
-Jerry Smith, who's in the Hall of Fame…
-Yeah.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.169
Jerry was the fellow that brought me out.

11:10.252 --> 11:13.047
-He was out while he was playing?
-He wasn't out at all.

11:13.130 --> 11:16.258
He couldn't care less,
because Jerry was such a great athlete.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.387
At that time, they had
kind of like an underground network.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.932
-You guys were meeting in secret?
-We'd go out at the gay discos.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.018
-Were there rumors in the league?
-There was always rumors.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.939
My mother and father
were really embarrassed at the time,

11:30.940 --> 11:34.443
but I had my right to live,
and… and I chose to live it. You know?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.778
Mm-hmm.

11:35.861 --> 11:40.825
I… I had the first love of my life
get killed in fighting the Vietnam War.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.744
And I went to the coach,
and I said, "I gotta go to a funeral,"

11:43.828 --> 11:45.538
and I'd be back for the ball game.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.833
And he said no, and I said,
"Well, bullshit, I'm going."

11:48.916 --> 11:51.627
"This is a man I loved,
and he died for this country."

11:51.711 --> 11:55.381
So I went and I got back in for the game,
and it was--

11:55.464 --> 11:57.383
It turned out to be a… a good thing.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.219
And I kind of put that damn coach
in his place, you know?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.264
-Yeah.
-You need to start calling people out.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.058
-That's… Not outing people, but just…
-Yeah.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.561
…calling people
to address the issue with us.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.688
I'm more nervous to talk to my coaches

12:10.771 --> 12:13.190
-than I am, like, my parents.
-Yeah.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.986
After I was retired, that's when I started
really being honest with myself.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.904
I wrote The David Kopay Story,

12:18.988 --> 12:20.448
and my mother said,

12:20.531 --> 12:21.907
"How could you do such a thing

12:21.991 --> 12:24.618
when you come out in the newspapers
and embarrass us so?"

12:24.702 --> 12:26.996
I says, "Mom,
I'm not embarrassed who I am."

12:27.079 --> 12:29.623
I says, "If you are, that's your problem."

12:29.707 --> 12:33.544
Nobody should ever have to go through
the depression and suicidal nature

12:33.627 --> 12:36.088
that we both experienced,
and… and the hatred.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.423
For me,

12:38.424 --> 12:40.468
this man right here saved my life.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.011
I was going through a hard time,

12:42.094 --> 12:44.513
I wanted to drive my car
over the cliff in Hawaii,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.474
but a friend of mine gave me his book,

12:46.557 --> 12:48.684
and I was like,
"Oh my gosh, are you kidding me?"

12:48.768 --> 12:49.935
Like, a gay NFL player?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.480
But, see, that's the world
that we live in, where you…

12:52.563 --> 12:54.482
You're afraid to do anything.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.568
So when I played with the Vikings,
when my mom would come visit,

12:57.651 --> 12:59.361
she would also always make me a lei.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.113
It would put a smile on my face.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.700
It was to hide the pain because every day
I walked through that locker room,

13:04.784 --> 13:07.787
I transformed myself
into somebody I wasn't, a straight guy.

13:07.870 --> 13:13.167
I definitely unleashed on another player,

13:13.250 --> 13:17.046
just sort of get all of that anxiety,
all of the stress, all of it out.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.715
When you're in the closet,
you have to compartmentalize so much.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.301
You have to always
think about what you're saying,

13:22.384 --> 13:25.137
you're always kind of paranoid
about being found out.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.306
And when I was in the closet, competing,

13:27.389 --> 13:30.518
I had a boyfriend for a bunch of years
and was not telling anybody.

13:30.601 --> 13:34.438
I hadn't even told my family, friends,
it was completely in the closet.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.567
But I remember being at X Games
and they'd come up before the competition,

13:38.651 --> 13:40.903
'cause they want to get
friends and family on TV,

13:40.986 --> 13:43.405
and they'd be like,
"Do you have your girlfriend here?"

13:43.489 --> 13:45.699
And I would be like,
"Uh, no. No girlfriend."

13:45.783 --> 13:48.911
Meanwhile, my boyfriend was there,
and I was too ashamed to be like,

13:48.994 --> 13:50.538
"He's here. Put him on TV."

13:50.621 --> 13:52.289
You're neglecting him
and yourself.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.085
-It shot a hole in your heart, right?
-100%. Breaks your heart.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.003
For me, I think the worst time

13:58.087 --> 14:00.673
is when we went
to the Super Bowl with Atlanta.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.591
All the players leaving the bus,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.928
hugging their wives, hugging,
kissing their girlfriends, all that.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.847
I couldn't do that. My partner comes in,

14:07.930 --> 14:09.890
we give him a signal,
"Meet me in the room,"

14:09.974 --> 14:12.726
and when I got to the room,
I bawled my eyes out, right?

14:12.810 --> 14:16.730
But it's one of those things that
you can't get that fricking memory back.

14:18.315 --> 14:21.360
The problem is, for the longest time,
I thought I had to please people.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.820
-You're Christian?
-Yeah.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.364
The only person
you need to please is the man upstairs.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.658
-Let him guide you.
-That's how I feel right now.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.785
That's all you need to do.
Seriously.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.205
Being a football player and being
an athlete, in general, you're taught,

14:33.289 --> 14:36.792
"Don't let them know they're getting
to you, hide your emotions, be strong--"

14:36.876 --> 14:38.127
Been, done!

14:38.210 --> 14:39.253
Yeah.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.339
You can't just walk off the football field
and have that go away.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.340
It sticks with you.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.926
It's an emotional game,
though, right, playing sports?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.303
I mean, we get emotional.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.555
-We cry, we laugh, we get angry.
-Yeah.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.932
Joy is just so much a part of football.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.934
I tell you what,
when you come into your truth,

14:54.018 --> 14:56.437
like what you're doing right now,
the smile is real.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.689
-Keep smiling. Keep dancing.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.483
Is there a better smile
in the whole place than that right there?

15:02.568 --> 15:06.071
Being around different types
of generations of people who are gay,

15:06.155 --> 15:08.991
it's like we didn't miss a beat,
like I'm in that locker room.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.452
And I think
that's where I get my strength from.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.622
My brothers and my teammates,
they get it. It's… It's nice.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.791
Do you genuinely think,
when you came out, the NFL was ready?

15:18.375 --> 15:19.960
No. I don't think so.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.546
I agree. Were you ever worried
about the coaches?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.632
Yeah! They were like father figures to me.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.258
-Yeah.
-That was a toughie.

15:26.342 --> 15:30.471
Coming out is incredibly difficult
for anyone to do.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.891
I think for Michael Sam
to go through what he went through

15:33.974 --> 15:37.895
and to be torn down,
and to be a person of color,

15:37.978 --> 15:39.563
and have people coming at him

15:39.647 --> 15:42.900
not only for being gay
but for being a Black gay person,

15:42.983 --> 15:44.485
it's inspiring to me to know,

15:44.568 --> 15:48.364
hey, if he got through this,
maybe one day I can get there.

15:48.864 --> 15:52.618
What I struggled with the most
after coming out in the NFL

15:52.701 --> 15:55.162
was mostly I did not know
what I wanted to do.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.205
I felt so lost.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.082
I felt so in limbo.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.460
And it took me a long time
to kind of get to where I am now.

16:02.836 --> 16:07.883
Me now, sitting here, I wish I had
the balls to tell you you weren't alone.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.594
I feel like I missed
the opportunity to come out

16:10.678 --> 16:12.888
and say, "Hey, dude,
I'm right here with you,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.139
and I'm in San Diego."

16:17.768 --> 16:19.019
I know, for me,

16:19.103 --> 16:22.356
having Michael Sam coming out
and being in a locker room

16:22.439 --> 16:23.565
meant a lot to me.

16:23.649 --> 16:28.112
I do regret not reaching out,
not talking to… to him during that time.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.408
-Yeah.
-I think knowing that gave me sanity.

16:32.491 --> 16:36.120
You know? Just like, "Hey, I know
I'm not alone, and that's good enough."

16:38.330 --> 16:41.667
On the draft moment,
you have your boyfriend at the time there,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.503
all of a sudden the story was
you were making out with your boyfriend.

16:44.586 --> 16:47.047
I don't know how you could handle that,
'cause I was…

16:47.131 --> 16:49.341
I wasn't you
and I was, like, feeling for you.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.343
Mostly, I didn't care.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.013
I… I was so comfortable with myself,
I was happy.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.723
I got to do what I wanted to do.

16:55.806 --> 16:59.268
Go to frigging drag night
two days before a football game,

16:59.351 --> 17:02.563
and I just lived my life, you know,
and you like me or you don't.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.480
Yeah.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.525
-You know? And--
-See, that's perfect. That simplicity.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.570
-That's exactly what you should be doing.
-Right.

17:09.653 --> 17:13.240
Did you get any support from, like,
your parents or your brothers, sisters?

17:13.323 --> 17:16.452
Before I came out publicly,
I texted my parents.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.037
Uh, texted my mom.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.289
She replied back
with some Bible scriptures,

17:20.372 --> 17:22.624
and I just kind of laughed.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.044
Like, "Okay. All right."

17:25.127 --> 17:26.503
My dad didn't text me back.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.090
The… Next time I heard my dad
was when he came, uh,

17:30.174 --> 17:33.677
and kind of "talked on"
to, uh, Time's interview.

17:33.761 --> 17:37.347
And he pretty much said
he didn't want his grandkids around that.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.308
When he died, my sister called me.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.770
I was like, I don't know
if I'm actually gonna cry or not.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.857
At the funeral, the day of,
as it was leading up to it, I just bawled.

17:47.524 --> 17:52.029
Uh, I don't think we was ever
going to get that father-son relationship,

17:52.112 --> 17:53.781
but he was my father, I love him,

17:53.864 --> 17:55.949
and I know
he's with my brothers and sisters.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.202
-So… Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.912
Yeah.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.206
-Appreciate it.
-All right.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.086
Hearing the stories
from David Kopay,

18:07.169 --> 18:10.255
Esera, and going through it with Michael,

18:10.339 --> 18:13.801
the one thing that sticks out to me
is nothing's fucking changed.

18:14.384 --> 18:19.556
I think just trying to imagine being
so happy and so fulfilled professionally

18:19.640 --> 18:23.852
and not being able to have
the people in your life that mean the most

18:23.936 --> 18:25.312
to be by your side

18:25.395 --> 18:30.526
just because people won't agree
with your sexuality is… is rough.

18:31.652 --> 18:35.114
Make sure you lead with your heart
and not what other people say.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.615
-You need a good team.
-Right.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.659
You need a good team.
A good support group.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.411
Oh golly, this has been great, guys.
Thank you for--

18:41.495 --> 18:43.914
-Thank you.
-I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.458
Let's make a quick toast.
I appreciate you all coming out.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.709
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.336
-Aloha.
-Cheers.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.647
Hi!

19:09.940 --> 19:13.485
-How are you? Thanks for getting me.
-Good. How are you? Yeah!

19:13.569 --> 19:15.654
-Was your travels good?
-Yeah. How were yours?

19:15.737 --> 19:17.239
-Good. Smooth.
-Yeah? Good!

19:17.322 --> 19:18.699
Thanks for picking me up.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.118
Yeah, your flight
got in a little early, so,

19:21.201 --> 19:22.369
-all good.
-Sweet.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.956
How embarrassing I don't know how to
get back to my hometown from the airport,

19:26.039 --> 19:28.125
-because it's been so long.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.086
The both of us, it would take an hour
to get back without GPS.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.213
-I kind of remember, but…
-It's sort of sad.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.925
I, like, touched down,
and immediately was, like, anxious.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.760
-I was like, "Oh no."
-Oh.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.887
Yeah.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.472
There's something about this town

19:42.556 --> 19:45.017
that puts that pressure
on everyone, for sure.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.144
If it wasn't for my family,

19:47.227 --> 19:51.440
I'm not sure I would be back here
as frequently as I am, so…

19:51.523 --> 19:55.485
Everybody knows everybody's business.
I think that's why my parents left too,

19:55.569 --> 19:58.780
is they went through
their own struggles and battles here,

19:58.864 --> 20:01.700
and… it just gets exhausting.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.535
Yeah. To be quite honest with you,

20:03.619 --> 20:06.997
I'm shocked that you can
hold off the anxiety until you land,

20:07.080 --> 20:12.502
'cause I see that "Peoria" on the… screen,
and I'm like, "No, thanks."

20:12.586 --> 20:16.632
I know. I am nervous because
I'm gonna go talk to Coach Crouch too.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.676
-Mm-hmm.
-And that's got me a little…

20:19.760 --> 20:22.971
Uh… I don't know.
I mean, the thing with him….

20:23.055 --> 20:24.431
I've always looked up to him.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.434
-I've always wanted to make him happy.
-Yeah.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.311
So I'm gonna talk to him.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.562
Is he still a coach?

20:30.646 --> 20:32.356
-Yeah. He's still a head coach.
-Okay.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.901
We've kept in touch over the years,
and he's always been there to support me.

20:35.984 --> 20:39.071
I've always texted him on Friday nights,
"Good luck. Go get them."

20:39.154 --> 20:40.113
Oh my gosh.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.866
I mean, my football community
is my second family.

20:43.575 --> 20:48.038
One of my best memories of coach
was, like, our final embrace on the field

20:48.121 --> 20:50.290
after we absolutely got destroyed.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.793
Let's go, defense!

20:52.876 --> 20:54.336
Hold them back!

20:54.419 --> 20:57.631
If you cannot, then grab 'em under, guys.
Grab 'em under.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.342
I remember just, like, you know, bawling,

21:00.425 --> 21:04.638
and he came over and, like, gave me
a big bear hug and was crying too.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.850
And was just like, "I'm gonna miss you."
You know, "Thanks for everything you did."

21:08.934 --> 21:14.523
As a player, you always set out
to make your… your coach happy and proud,

21:14.606 --> 21:17.609
and all you want
is your coach to, like, tell you

21:17.693 --> 21:19.820
how much you've meant to him as a player.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.948
I don't want him to be disappointed.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.409
I don't want him
to think differently of me.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.370
I don't want to let him down… ever.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.790
But I also need him
to care about what I was going through.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.251
I'm going to the high school.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.837
If you want to come with me,
walk the halls,

21:36.920 --> 21:39.840
-check out the old lockers…
-Of course. Yeah.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.883
Hopefully,
I can still find my locker.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.136
-You remember your locker?
-Uh-huh.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.806
You don't? You put the football on it
every Thursday or Friday.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.434
Do I remember your locker
or do I remember my own locker?

21:50.517 --> 21:52.561
You had the popular row. I remember it.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.271
-Oh, my goodness.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.445
Oh wow.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.281
This is so… grand.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.325
Holy Lord.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.911
This is rad.
I love it. We have lacrosse?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.998
-That's new.
-So East Coast of us. I'm really proud.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.459
We also have bass fishing.
We're like a legit school.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.376
I know.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.379
-Oh wow.
-It's still the same gym.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.298
I gotta shoot a free throw.

22:21.381 --> 22:22.966
-Spirit fingers.
-Spirit fingers.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.636
S-I-N-K-I-T! Sink it, Colton, sink it!

22:26.720 --> 22:28.263
Yes! All right.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.182
Now you got me fired up. Here we go.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.894
Oh come on!

22:33.977 --> 22:35.479
Just like that.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.399
-Oh!
-Oh, come on.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.659
-You're rusty.
-You think football is my sport?

22:49.743 --> 22:50.911
Really rusty.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.872
Oh, gosh.

22:53.955 --> 22:54.956
This is where--

22:55.040 --> 22:57.417
I know. I was going to say,
It's coming up right here.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.502
Right here.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.296
Me and my girlfriend at the time
would, like, hang out,

23:01.380 --> 23:02.547
and I spit mad game.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.799
No, you didn't.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.218
-I was like, "How you doing?"
-Oh no.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.428
-Not a move we want to use anymore.

23:09.012 --> 23:12.140
Hey, baby. So do you got
the math homework, or what?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.851
-That is accurate, but…

23:16.186 --> 23:17.354
Oh, shoot.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.649
Brings back so many memories.

23:21.149 --> 23:25.362
I remember, my girlfriend at the time,
we were at a party when I was with her.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.907
So we were on a couch,
and I think we were sleeping over there.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.200
Mm-hmm.

23:30.283 --> 23:33.745
She put her hand down my pants,
and the next day, I broke up with her.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.708
Like, I remember
feeling nauseous after that happened,

23:38.792 --> 23:41.420
and, like, feeling disappointed in myself,

23:41.503 --> 23:43.171
feeling confused, feeling like,

23:43.255 --> 23:46.466
"Why can't I just be like
everybody else in the high school?"

23:46.550 --> 23:49.302
A lot of people are trying to figure
themselves out in high school.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.264
And for me, I was trying to do that,

23:52.347 --> 23:57.519
but I also wasn't allowed to explore
a really, really big part of who I was

23:57.602 --> 23:59.855
and what I needed to try to figure out.

24:00.814 --> 24:04.734
Was that the first time you thought,
like, "I'm actually gay"?

24:06.236 --> 24:09.448
I mean, I would always, like,
find an excuse or find, like, a way

24:09.531 --> 24:11.241
to justify why I felt like that.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.785
"I didn't like her that much,"
or "I want to wait for marriage."

24:13.869 --> 24:16.163
"Maybe that's what
my body and my mind's trying to tell me."

24:16.246 --> 24:19.499
It's so hard for me to even explain,
but it just felt so wrong.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.210
And not wrong
in the sense of, like, morally.

24:23.378 --> 24:27.674
It just felt wrong in the fact that,
like, that wasn't who I was meant to be.

24:28.341 --> 24:32.345
When I look back, that's sort of where
the control part of me kicked in,

24:32.929 --> 24:35.432
of wanting and needing
control of my own life,

24:35.515 --> 24:37.601
because in that moment, I didn't have it,

24:38.185 --> 24:40.520
but it was this lie.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.355
That was my defense mechanism.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.942
The fallout from that
was the whole, entire school,

24:46.026 --> 24:46.943
like, after that,

24:47.027 --> 24:50.030
everybody went around
being like, "Oh, he's gay. He's gay."

24:50.113 --> 24:53.575
That was the first time that
I almost got outed, and I was just like…

24:55.577 --> 24:59.289
"Fuck, I'm gonna have to really
go along with this if I want to hide it."

25:08.089 --> 25:09.966
Still got the same smell.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.968
Yeah, it's… Does not smell good.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.189
Wow.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.654
This brings up, like, a lot of…
a lot of confusion.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.953
What do you feel being back here?

25:46.002 --> 25:47.462
Weird, but, like, sad.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.172
I had to, like…

25:51.841 --> 25:53.176
shrink who I was.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.136
Like, I had to hide.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.680
When I came into here,

25:56.763 --> 25:59.558
I had to, like,
crawl in a hole and wanted to die.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.352
I couldn't let my guard down.

26:02.435 --> 26:05.146
I couldn't relax.
I couldn't just shoot the shit.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.231
Yeah.

26:06.314 --> 26:10.777
I think that's also where,
like… a heavy part of this started.

26:12.445 --> 26:17.158
Just the confusion,
just, like, the… figuring it out part.

26:18.868 --> 26:23.582
Locker room talk
is so fucking confusing. Um…

26:23.665 --> 26:27.836
Obviously, I was a young kid at the time,
trying to figure out what that all meant,

26:27.919 --> 26:31.798
but a locker room can be
one of the most homoerotic places,

26:31.881 --> 26:34.593
and it can also be
one of the most homophobic places.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.554
Which means, like, slapping of the ass.

26:37.637 --> 26:41.182
But then also, on the other hand,
they'll be the first ones to say,

26:41.266 --> 26:43.852
"Cut that gay shit out,"
or, "What, are you gay?"

26:43.935 --> 26:46.021
Those things get thrown around so loosely,

26:46.104 --> 26:49.149
and just sort of a fucked-up place
for a gay man to be.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.734
I remember, we had, like…

26:52.319 --> 26:53.862
one gay kid in the school,

26:53.945 --> 26:57.532
and like when
you had a bad play or you did…

26:57.616 --> 26:59.784
It was always
when you did something wrong,

27:00.368 --> 27:01.703
they would call you by his name.

27:02.454 --> 27:05.540
And I just remember,
that at the time, it's so high schoolish,

27:05.624 --> 27:08.043
but, like, that at the time
was the ultimate diss

27:08.126 --> 27:09.961
is to be called that guy's name.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.797
-I was like--
-Which is horrible.

27:13.465 --> 27:19.054
That is what keeps people in the closet,
is because a lot of the toxic… parts

27:19.638 --> 27:23.725
were allowed
and deemed part of the culture.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.770
I'll take full responsibility
and I'll take full ownership

27:26.853 --> 27:29.189
of when those jokes
were being made, I laughed.

27:29.272 --> 27:32.400
When those jokes were being made,
I egged them on. I got, like…

27:33.234 --> 27:34.861
I played into it just as much

27:34.944 --> 27:37.447
'cause then it would
lead to people asking questions of,

27:37.530 --> 27:39.157
"Why are you standing up for it?"

27:41.076 --> 27:42.327
But it started at the top.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.079
It's like a trickle-down effect.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.748
I mean, football and sports
is all about hierarchy.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.125
-Yeah.
-We look at leadership.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.877
We look for leadership.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.629
All of the problems

27:52.712 --> 27:55.674
and everything that's led me
to this point now started here.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.093
Having someone
who you view as your second father

27:58.176 --> 28:00.929
allow this toxic culture of football,

28:01.012 --> 28:03.932
whether they meant it or not,
it still had an impact on me.

28:04.015 --> 28:07.477
I'm sure there's people that'll watch this
and say, "He's being soft now."

28:07.560 --> 28:08.603
"He can't take a joke."

28:08.687 --> 28:10.355
Eventually those jokes aren't jokes,

28:10.438 --> 28:12.941
and eventually those jokes
are what you believe in

28:13.024 --> 28:15.402
and what you stand for,
and enough is enough.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.822
And I think it's fair for me to say, like,

28:19.739 --> 28:21.032
"Make a different joke."

28:21.116 --> 28:23.076
-Let's get out of here.
-Okay.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.413
I need some fresh air.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.497
Yes.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.174
Let's go!

28:38.925 --> 28:40.760
-Yow.
-Yeah.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.641
Are you fricking kidding me?

28:47.142 --> 28:48.143
Hike!

28:49.477 --> 28:51.479
-I used to be down there, D-line.

28:51.563 --> 28:55.442
Gotta get hands inside, Gauf.
All right, now I'm going to beat his ass.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.278
Push, pull. Push, pull. Push, pull.

28:58.862 --> 29:02.073
-Colton, would you come on down, please?
-Oh, shoot, here we go.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.706
These are the pass rushers?

29:09.789 --> 29:12.083
That's all I got.
And we need to win Friday night,

29:12.167 --> 29:14.294
so you need to do
a bit of magic with four of them.

29:14.377 --> 29:15.628
I'll see what I can do.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.381
Pass rushing,
we're gonna start with a club rip.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.258
A real, like, run-through…

29:22.218 --> 29:24.804
would be something like… like right there.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.015
And then to your left,
like, really throw it.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.769
Really throw your hips
and get your foot through. Ready? Set!

29:31.811 --> 29:35.023
There you go. Hips, hips, hips!
I want this one rapid-fire.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.442
And if you're slow,
your ass'll probably get ran over,

29:37.525 --> 29:38.568
so don't be slow.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.945
I'm a completely different person
when I step on the field.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.490
My mindset changes,

29:43.573 --> 29:45.909
and that was what was
beautiful about football,

29:45.992 --> 29:49.829
is I can sort of just flip a switch
and be a completely different person.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.042
I know you guys are teammates,
but keep this as realistic as possible.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.668
Engage and shed.

29:56.252 --> 29:57.086
Set!

29:57.796 --> 30:00.548
-There you go! Protect yourself! Whoo!
-Get up, get there.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.884
Bring your rip up high. Rip up high.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.219
Finish! There you go.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.972
I had enough ammo to always
tap into this place of aggression,

30:08.056 --> 30:10.642
and that was because,
first and foremost, I hated myself,

30:10.725 --> 30:12.852
and then I also had
a bunch of people around me

30:12.936 --> 30:16.731
who I thought hated who I was
as a human being too, being gay.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.068
So it was very easy for me
to tap into this place of, like…

30:21.236 --> 30:22.612
"Fuck you. Check this out."

30:22.695 --> 30:23.655
Set!

30:24.948 --> 30:26.324
-Protect yourself!

30:26.407 --> 30:28.076
Finish! Finish! There you go.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.702
Whoo!

30:30.245 --> 30:31.788
I want you guys to thank Colton.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.916
-Appreciate it very much.
-Good luck. Yeah! Of course.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.252
-Thanks.
-Keep working hard. You do good too.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.420
-All right?
-So let's go, hop in.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.180
-What up, girl?

30:49.264 --> 30:50.682
-How are you?
-Good. How you doin'?

30:50.765 --> 30:53.518
Good. Check this out.
This is the view I got right now.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.854
High school football practice, dude.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.856
Brings me back
to my cheerleading days.

30:57.939 --> 31:01.526
-Were you a cheerleader?
-No. We didn't even have a football team.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.152
-Oh really? Oh, shoot.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.072
I walked through my high school today,

31:06.155 --> 31:09.993
and it brought up a lot of old memories,
a lot of weird emotions and thoughts

31:10.076 --> 31:11.995
that I've buried
for a long time, you know?

31:12.078 --> 31:12.912
I bet.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.707
I think I'm gonna go
talk to my coach and stuff.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.751
Sort of what I went through,
like, my experience and…

31:19.627 --> 31:20.837
You nervous?

31:20.920 --> 31:24.382
Dude, honestly, I'm more terrified
to tell him than I was, like, my dad.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.676
I get that
you're putting him on a pedestal

31:26.759 --> 31:28.553
because he was your high school coach,

31:28.636 --> 31:31.472
and you looked up to him,
and you were on this great program,

31:31.973 --> 31:33.558
but you don't owe him anything.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.394
Yeah.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.022
There were moments
in high school and on the field

31:39.105 --> 31:44.903
that Coach Crouch was more of a dad
and a father figure to me than a coach.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.655
And he knew how to push me.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.826
He knew how to sort of mold me
and craft me into the best player.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.954
But I think
that's the challenge in it too, is… is…

31:55.538 --> 31:57.999
There's a part of guilt for me

31:58.082 --> 32:00.710
of being like,
now I'm about to drop this bomb.

32:00.793 --> 32:04.547
But I think it is important for me now
to just say, "Hey, you impacted me,

32:04.631 --> 32:07.592
and there were some things you did
that didn't sit right with me."

32:07.675 --> 32:11.554
Suicides are much higher
amongst LGBTQ kids

32:11.638 --> 32:13.765
than they are their straight counterparts,

32:13.848 --> 32:16.726
and coaches, teachers,
people that we're supposed to look up to,

32:16.809 --> 32:19.062
they need to make it a safe place.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.397
Yeah. No, I hear you loud and clear.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.318
I talked to my little cousin,
he's a senior here,

32:25.401 --> 32:27.528
and he's like,
"Things haven't really changed."

32:28.196 --> 32:29.822
There's slurs thrown around all the time,

32:29.906 --> 32:31.866
and part of me
is like looking at those kids, like,

32:31.950 --> 32:35.453
"I wonder if they're going through
something similar or struggling privately

32:35.536 --> 32:37.246
or not knowing how to process or…"

32:37.330 --> 32:39.958
I think being able to have
a heart-to-heart with them

32:40.041 --> 32:42.460
and just say, sort of,
"This was my experience,

32:42.543 --> 32:44.045
and this is what I went through."

32:44.128 --> 32:47.173
It's a lot more than just,
like, a conversation with him.

32:47.674 --> 32:48.967
It goes way beyond that.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.760
Let me know how it goes, for sure.

32:50.843 --> 32:53.096
Yeah, I will.
I'll keep you posted, dude.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.598
-All right, sounds good.
-All right, man. Bye.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.516
Good luck.

33:11.447 --> 33:12.657
I, like, wanna throw up.

33:17.620 --> 33:21.416
I'm a 29-year-old grown man
who is no longer playing football,

33:21.499 --> 33:23.042
but he is still my coach.

33:23.126 --> 33:27.088
I heard "homo," "gay," "soft."

33:27.588 --> 33:31.634
I heard all of these things
from the coaching staff and the faculty.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.929
-You have time to talk after?
-I do.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.556
-Yep.
-Okay. Sweet.

33:36.639 --> 33:37.640
Some stiff dudes.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.060
I know. I think I was stiff
in high school, though, too.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.812
-They were very stiff.
-Yeah.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.815
Oh, shoot.

33:45.898 --> 33:49.402
Um, I walked the school today.
A lot's changed.

33:49.485 --> 33:53.448
All changed. Like that whole infield.
Like, that's all filled in.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.991
-Yeah.
-That's all brand-new.

33:55.074 --> 33:58.077
And, like, weight room upgrade.
Definitely better on that end.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.538
I mean, for me, coming back here,

34:00.621 --> 34:04.500
I'm, like, finally unpacking some things
and trying to figure some things out.

34:04.584 --> 34:08.463
And one thing that I love about football
is the banter and the competitiveness

34:08.546 --> 34:11.924
and the drive and the adversity you face.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.969
And it's like,
on one hand, I love all that.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.262
And on the other hand…

34:17.889 --> 34:21.476
you know, the players,
the captains, the coaches, like,

34:22.435 --> 34:26.147
there was just moments for me
that was just, like, forced me to shrink.

34:26.731 --> 34:27.565
You know?

34:28.649 --> 34:31.027
I had a conversation
with my family back home.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.361
I came out to my parents,

34:32.945 --> 34:36.282
and my family has been
unbelievable and supportive.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.284
And it's hard because it's like…

34:38.367 --> 34:40.453
I want you to realize,
when I come back here,

34:40.536 --> 34:42.997
I get anxiety,
and where does that come from?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.957
Like, where did that start?

34:45.041 --> 34:46.667
Where did it start for me to be like,

34:46.751 --> 34:49.253
"You have to stay in the closet
and not allowed to not come out"?

34:49.337 --> 34:52.673
It started with… the jokes,
it started with name-calling.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.635
The homophobia in the locker room, for me,

34:55.718 --> 34:58.596
is the hardest thing
for me to digest and go through.

35:01.349 --> 35:05.520
I love you, and there's like…
so many things that you've taught me

35:05.603 --> 35:07.980
as a man and as a competitor
and as a person,

35:08.731 --> 35:13.027
but I would be doing myself a disservice
if I just didn't say that it started here.
