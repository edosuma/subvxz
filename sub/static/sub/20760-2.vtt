WEBVTT

00:54.991 --> 00:56.958
Where am I right now?

00:57.234 --> 00:59.130
Somewhere warm...

00:59.155 --> 01:00.788
safe...

01:00.813 --> 01:03.180
with people who care about me?

01:03.498 --> 01:04.917
Nope.

01:04.919 --> 01:06.552
Not me.

01:08.121 --> 01:10.232
Some of us got left behind.

01:11.921 --> 01:14.859
So what do you do when you're
stranded in the wrong place?

01:14.861 --> 01:16.060
The wrong time?

01:42.915 --> 01:45.516
What do you do when not
even God'll help you?

01:47.523 --> 01:50.834
You accept that the
only one you can rely on

01:50.859 --> 01:52.363
is yourself.

01:56.445 --> 01:59.070
So how do you send a
message to the future?

01:59.072 --> 02:01.306
How does E.T. phone home?

02:31.204 --> 02:32.871
You need a venue.

02:32.873 --> 02:34.123
Huh?

02:34.148 --> 02:35.608
You got to make a splash big enough

02:35.633 --> 02:37.652
to hit 'em a hundred years from now.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.932
Make 'em laugh.

02:46.887 --> 02:47.919
Whoa.

02:47.921 --> 02:49.320
Make 'em cry.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.660
Give 'em what they want.

03:03.319 --> 03:04.569
Just when you've got 'em

03:04.571 --> 03:06.204
right in the palm of your hand...

03:10.110 --> 03:11.776
You hit 'em with the goods...

03:16.016 --> 03:17.215
Your message.

03:17.217 --> 03:19.887
Your pièce de résistance.

03:22.395 --> 03:25.168
The story you were born to tell.

04:04.097 --> 04:07.551
Blood! Blood! Blood!

04:53.758 --> 04:55.493
Oh!

05:25.977 --> 05:28.546
So I can go home.

05:58.788 --> 06:01.343
I hope you guys are okay.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.010
You...

06:55.231 --> 06:56.997
Such a gift for prophecy.

06:59.058 --> 07:00.799
You've been busy, Primary.

07:00.824 --> 07:03.036
I knew you were coming to Paris.

07:03.038 --> 07:04.271
I could see it.

07:08.841 --> 07:10.443
Horsemen without horses.

07:10.446 --> 07:12.308
Paradox in a box.

07:13.576 --> 07:15.269
Where is it?

07:15.887 --> 07:18.187
Saw us in your head, did you?

07:18.189 --> 07:20.089
Well, that's a terrible thing.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.863
You're not supposed to be here.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.535
Neither are you.

08:01.032 --> 08:02.845
Who's with you?

08:04.202 --> 08:05.968
No one.

08:05.970 --> 08:07.503
Good.

08:08.973 --> 08:09.997
Oh!

08:20.243 --> 08:21.769
Jennifer...

08:32.010 --> 08:33.736
Finally!

08:54.988 --> 08:56.277
Okay...

08:57.890 --> 08:59.699
Jennifer, I have no
idea what you're saying.

08:59.724 --> 09:01.173
- Slow down.
- Slow?

09:01.198 --> 09:02.998
Things have been pretty slow, Cole.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.536
- Been a while.
- We thought you were in Titan.

09:05.561 --> 09:07.488
This is how we found you.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.772
Tomorrow you get pegged
for your boss's murder.

09:10.774 --> 09:14.636
"Obscure Actress J.H. Bond
Murders Theater Owner."

09:14.661 --> 09:16.411
Obscure?

09:16.413 --> 09:17.946
What happened to you in Titan?

09:17.948 --> 09:19.325
Titan?

09:20.084 --> 09:22.117
Whoosh! 1917!

09:22.119 --> 09:23.785
Bombs, bullets, balloons, baguettes!

09:23.787 --> 09:25.144
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Alliteration!

09:25.169 --> 09:26.288
What about Cassie?

09:26.290 --> 09:28.581
I don't know. What about Cassie?

09:28.606 --> 09:30.158
Deacon tried to save me.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.294
Ramse! Did you see
what happened to Ramse?

09:32.296 --> 09:33.862
Think, Jennifer.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.528
Five years!

09:35.553 --> 09:39.206
I've been here, alone, by myself

09:39.231 --> 09:41.597
for five years, and
you're asking about Cassie,

09:41.622 --> 09:42.905
about Ramse?

09:42.907 --> 09:44.339
What about me?

09:44.341 --> 09:46.942
What about, "Hey, hey,
Jennifer, really missed you.

09:46.944 --> 09:49.623
"How did you survive World War I?"

09:49.914 --> 09:51.668
Hey, I'm really glad you asked,

09:51.693 --> 09:53.849
because I was a prisoner of war!

09:53.851 --> 09:56.184
- Jennifer...
- And you, Grandma Time!

09:56.186 --> 09:58.086
- Excuse me?
- Check your mail?

09:58.088 --> 10:00.833
Been sending you
messages, leaving clues!

10:00.858 --> 10:02.888
I even wrote an album!

10:03.928 --> 10:05.494
Hmm?

10:05.496 --> 10:07.482
"Délivrez-moi de France"...

10:07.507 --> 10:08.897
"Rescue me from France."

10:08.899 --> 10:10.748
"Toujours en 1921"...

10:10.773 --> 10:12.363
"Still in 1921."

10:12.388 --> 10:13.802
And my personal favorite...

10:13.804 --> 10:17.940
"Jones, pourquoi est-ce si long?"

10:18.976 --> 10:22.949
"Jones, what's taking so long?"

10:22.974 --> 10:25.147
I mean, it rhymes in French, obviously.

10:25.149 --> 10:27.015
Apparently this eluded us.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.417
Well, it was a big hit here.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.153
Why on Earth did you use a stage name?

10:31.155 --> 10:33.802
So they wouldn't find me.

10:35.225 --> 10:38.406
This is why I came to Paris. I saw them.

10:38.431 --> 10:41.705
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
with a paradox in a box.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.533
Para-box.

10:53.666 --> 10:56.211
This is splinter technology.

10:56.213 --> 10:59.314
This "paradox in a box"... what is it?

10:59.316 --> 11:01.249
I don't know.

11:01.251 --> 11:02.680
Bad news, though.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.564
It's like a weapon or something.

11:06.423 --> 11:09.470
Once again, Causality's
Fool finds herself

11:09.495 --> 11:11.362
entangled in our enemy's conspiracy.

11:11.365 --> 11:12.564
Wait, me?

11:12.566 --> 11:13.884
So what are you thinking?

11:13.924 --> 11:15.156
Causality's Fool?

11:15.158 --> 11:17.025
This technology he possesses,

11:17.027 --> 11:19.580
coupled with Miss Goines' visions...

11:20.330 --> 11:23.264
something is happening
of profound importance

11:23.266 --> 11:25.725
with the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

11:26.303 --> 11:30.105
So if this asshole is
one of her four horsemen,

11:30.107 --> 11:31.940
where's the other three?

11:45.798 --> 11:47.056
What is it?

11:47.057 --> 11:48.990
Mr. Hockley is overdue.

11:48.992 --> 11:52.124
Said something about
going to the theater.

12:36.139 --> 12:37.925
Where's my son?

12:38.456 --> 12:40.409
The Witness is safe.

12:41.645 --> 12:43.730
Why was I sedated?

12:44.491 --> 12:46.082
Your safety.

12:46.107 --> 12:47.348
His.

12:49.085 --> 12:51.163
I want to see him.

12:52.355 --> 12:55.061
What need would that satisfy?

12:56.162 --> 12:57.495
He's mine.

13:00.263 --> 13:03.364
If the Mother wishes to meet her son,

13:03.366 --> 13:05.490
I shall take her to him.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.355
What is this?

13:33.862 --> 13:35.761
Your son.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.094
What is all this?

14:12.931 --> 14:15.280
I said I wanted to see my son.

14:15.305 --> 14:16.962
This...

14:17.754 --> 14:19.743
is your son.

14:20.196 --> 14:22.230
His history...

14:22.259 --> 14:24.212
our history.

14:24.883 --> 14:28.251
This place, these things...

14:28.290 --> 14:30.422
this is who your son will become.

14:32.269 --> 14:33.468
No, he's a...

14:33.470 --> 14:35.650
he's just a child.

14:38.642 --> 14:42.444
The Witness, your son, is a child,

14:42.446 --> 14:45.880
a man, a word...

14:45.882 --> 14:47.775
our savior.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.869
Present now, yet also in the past.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.330
He's all of this...

14:56.126 --> 14:58.088
simultaneously.

14:59.312 --> 15:01.249
He's not here, is he?

15:02.032 --> 15:03.431
The man.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.400
Only the child.

15:05.402 --> 15:09.701
But soon, the Witness
will return to Titan

15:09.726 --> 15:13.125
and lead the faithful to salvation.

15:13.844 --> 15:15.500
The Red Forest.

15:18.309 --> 15:20.341
But some here

15:20.366 --> 15:22.262
have lost faith.

15:25.122 --> 15:26.554
Who?

15:31.262 --> 15:33.356
I'm offering help.

15:34.164 --> 15:38.363
A time approaches... a
chance for you to leave Titan.

15:39.815 --> 15:42.449
- When?
- Soon.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.445
I'm not leaving without him.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.324
They will kill you.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.443
The Witness is no longer inside you.

15:48.445 --> 15:52.645
Your life is not as
precious as it once was.

15:53.116 --> 15:54.449
Die here,

15:54.451 --> 15:57.957
or prepare yourself for what must come.

15:59.256 --> 16:00.715
Please.

16:02.341 --> 16:05.652
All I'm asking for is a moment.

16:07.737 --> 16:09.731
Take me to my son.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.799
Come with me.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.544
Wow, this play is boring.

16:29.994 --> 16:31.960
This is decades beyond me.

16:31.985 --> 16:33.385
If I'd known that he was wearing this,

16:33.410 --> 16:34.542
I would've aimed for the head.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.601
Jonesy, you need to project!

16:36.603 --> 16:38.370
I can't hear you!

16:38.372 --> 16:41.142
I'm telling you, I was wearing...

16:41.167 --> 16:43.418
the future me was wearing
one of these things.

16:43.443 --> 16:45.302
Way to turn your back to the audience.

16:45.327 --> 16:47.050
Here's the power core.

16:47.075 --> 16:48.513
Navigation.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.527
- Temporal disbursement conduits...
- I get it. It's cool.

16:51.529 --> 16:52.795
No, it's not that.

16:52.797 --> 16:54.564
This changes the game entirely.

16:54.566 --> 16:55.765
Can we go home now?

16:55.767 --> 16:57.433
How do I find his three buddies?

16:57.435 --> 17:00.436
Uh, splinter back 30
minutes ago and ask him.

17:00.438 --> 17:03.039
Well, we can't do that
because we'd paradox.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.441
So why don't you summon
up some Primary powers

17:05.443 --> 17:06.643
and help us out?

17:06.645 --> 17:08.711
- Help you out?
- Yeah.

17:08.713 --> 17:10.413
All I ever do is help you, Cole.

17:11.516 --> 17:13.148
- Uh, J.D. Peoples...
- Look...

17:13.174 --> 17:14.955
- The Night Room... uh...
- ... it's not that hard.

17:14.958 --> 17:16.676
- Ramse at Project Splinter.
- We need to figure out...

17:16.702 --> 17:19.044
- Not releasing the plague.
- Would you shut up and listen to me?

17:19.069 --> 17:23.104
Shut up and listen? No,
you shut up and listen!

17:23.128 --> 17:24.972
What, are you barking at me

17:24.997 --> 17:26.573
because I don't know where Cassie is?

17:26.598 --> 17:29.042
'Cause we didn't come all
the way to 1922 just to...

17:29.067 --> 17:30.767
Rescue me.

17:30.769 --> 17:32.302
I know.

17:38.410 --> 17:39.817
So?

17:40.388 --> 17:42.153
Why did you come here, then?

17:42.817 --> 17:44.714
What do you need?

17:44.716 --> 17:46.466
Something up here?

17:47.177 --> 17:48.751
How about I go get my sketchpad,

17:48.753 --> 17:51.427
and I'll scribble out a little
bit more of my sanity for you?

17:51.452 --> 17:52.669
Miss Goines...

17:52.694 --> 17:55.175
I thought I was part of a team,

17:55.223 --> 17:57.797
not just the Primary that you outsource

17:57.822 --> 18:01.290
for all your time-travel
technical support.

18:02.634 --> 18:04.967
I have one last show for you.

18:04.969 --> 18:06.850
And it is a good one.

18:06.875 --> 18:09.605
It's called "Gone Girl."

18:09.607 --> 18:10.984
Jennifer!

18:11.009 --> 18:13.492
We have more important
things to contend with.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.936
This device on her drawing,

18:15.961 --> 18:18.219
this "paradox in a box"...

18:18.243 --> 18:21.016
could be a whole new
way to destroy time.

18:22.028 --> 18:24.297
How do we figure out where he came from?

18:24.683 --> 18:26.349
I found an ID on him.

18:26.351 --> 18:27.817
It's 1922.

18:27.819 --> 18:29.499
He didn't have to carry one...

18:29.524 --> 18:31.590
the overthinking of a time-traveler.

18:31.592 --> 18:34.560
This was Monsieur Hockley.

18:34.562 --> 18:36.274
And now we have his address.

18:36.299 --> 18:37.763
What about Jennifer?

18:37.765 --> 18:38.964
The enemy is here,

18:38.966 --> 18:40.438
doing God knows what

18:40.463 --> 18:42.078
with this technology.

18:42.103 --> 18:44.516
If they can do what I think they can,

18:44.541 --> 18:46.772
then we have to find them immediately.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.748
When are we leaving?

19:25.172 --> 19:26.911
First light.

19:27.494 --> 19:30.562
We have to be careful.
We're in Exile territory.

19:31.986 --> 19:34.588
We should be leaving in the dark.

19:34.613 --> 19:36.489
Exiles are nocturnal.

19:36.491 --> 19:39.391
We don't have the
numbers if they spot us.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.063
Been a lot of months.

19:45.002 --> 19:47.799
Too many of your goddamn stops.

19:48.402 --> 19:51.666
Too many of your shitty detours, right?

19:52.406 --> 19:55.741
I know the journey
cross-country's been arduous.

19:55.743 --> 19:57.996
But your boy awaits
you on the other side.

19:59.654 --> 20:01.277
My boy?

20:02.160 --> 20:04.168
He's not a boy.

20:04.952 --> 20:06.566
He's a man.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.543
You found him 23 years ago.

20:11.472 --> 20:13.511
You had my boy...

20:15.096 --> 20:16.800
for decades.

20:17.799 --> 20:21.834
I've been protecting him
because you could not.

20:33.976 --> 20:35.809
What'd you say?

20:35.983 --> 20:38.184
What does killing me now get you?

20:39.594 --> 20:41.954
Not where either of us want to be.

20:54.101 --> 20:56.258
You better not be lying.

20:57.638 --> 20:59.505
Your son is safe.

21:03.744 --> 21:05.736
Patience.

21:36.630 --> 21:37.796
What happened?

21:37.821 --> 21:40.363
They found us. Two days ago.

21:40.388 --> 21:42.554
We didn't want to radio in
case they were monitoring.

21:42.579 --> 21:44.046
Sam!

21:44.071 --> 21:45.488
He's in there.

21:49.252 --> 21:51.469
He was on guard with the others.

21:51.494 --> 21:53.885
I don't think he's gonna survive.

21:54.931 --> 21:57.973
The Witness's men hit us
hard before we drove them off.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.292
Sam?

22:49.495 --> 22:51.683
I just realized...

22:52.675 --> 22:55.464
you will always be ageless to me.

22:59.937 --> 23:02.652
I didn't know where you were.

23:04.355 --> 23:07.242
I was where I was meant to be.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.945
Olivia found me...

23:09.947 --> 23:12.316
in 2023.

23:13.527 --> 23:16.351
She should have brought you to me.

23:16.925 --> 23:19.254
She couldn't have.

23:19.581 --> 23:23.613
You were 19 in 2023.

23:24.589 --> 23:26.695
I would've been a burden.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.291
What are you talking about?

23:29.316 --> 23:31.472
You're not a burden.

23:31.796 --> 23:34.029
She protected me...

23:34.535 --> 23:37.245
kept me safe from the Witness...

23:38.876 --> 23:41.066
best she could.

23:42.022 --> 23:44.456
He's been hunting us.

23:45.956 --> 23:48.750
We've all outlived our cycles.

23:50.589 --> 23:53.652
Hey. Hey. You know what I'm gonna do?

23:54.277 --> 23:56.057
I'm gonna go to Jones.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.126
I can undo all of this.

23:58.128 --> 24:00.316
I don't want you to fix this.

24:01.699 --> 24:04.480
The world having to
die so I could live...

24:05.417 --> 24:08.924
You and I weren't meant to be like this.

24:15.918 --> 24:18.870
You're the only thing,

24:19.621 --> 24:22.322
the only thing in my life...

24:26.067 --> 24:28.777
that I don't hate myself for.

24:29.081 --> 24:31.261
You understand that?

24:32.307 --> 24:34.128
You're my boy.

24:35.394 --> 24:37.527
The only thing.

24:45.104 --> 24:47.805
You have to stop the Witness.

24:49.408 --> 24:51.613
Be the Traveler again.

24:52.303 --> 24:54.670
Save this world.

24:56.222 --> 24:58.248
Me with it.

25:04.056 --> 25:05.488
Okay.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.400
Olivia... she knows how.

25:15.012 --> 25:16.761
Help me.

25:17.644 --> 25:19.603
I'm dying, Dad.

25:24.878 --> 25:27.128
You got to help me.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.635
I'm not gonna make it.

25:34.899 --> 25:36.525
I can't.

25:39.437 --> 25:41.370
Please.

25:50.581 --> 25:52.523
Please, Dad.

25:53.164 --> 25:55.317
Let me go.

25:55.319 --> 25:57.100
I can't.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.086
Buddy, I can't.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.772
Please.

26:04.773 --> 26:06.812
Make it stop...

26:08.359 --> 26:10.256
the pain.

26:25.916 --> 26:28.729
There you go. There you go.

26:35.490 --> 26:37.457
You're my boy.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.097
It'll be okay.

26:48.449 --> 26:50.449
It'll be okay.

27:02.095 --> 27:03.594
It's okay.

27:03.596 --> 27:06.264
Shhh.

27:33.226 --> 27:35.826
I'm so sorry.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.040
I'm sorry.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.024
It's your fault.

27:58.049 --> 28:00.407
I told you the Witness
has been hunting us.

28:00.432 --> 28:02.288
Do not shoot! Stand down!

28:05.236 --> 28:07.503
This anger... use it.

28:07.505 --> 28:10.139
Help me stop the
Witness once and for all.

28:10.141 --> 28:11.574
I know how.

28:13.678 --> 28:15.590
I know how.

28:28.605 --> 28:30.473
I checked the theater district.

28:30.499 --> 28:32.262
Most haven't opened yet.

28:32.287 --> 28:33.944
No sign of Mr. Hockley.

28:33.969 --> 28:35.702
Not in the taverns either.

28:35.727 --> 28:37.694
It's entirely unlike him.

28:38.778 --> 28:40.636
We've been discovered.

28:40.661 --> 28:43.153
We need to know by whom and then...

28:43.178 --> 28:44.926
do what must be done.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.308
Well, shit.

29:51.671 --> 29:54.374
We're close. It says it's right up here.

30:04.243 --> 30:05.921
Here, this building

30:05.946 --> 30:08.820
matches the address
on the identification.

30:15.455 --> 30:18.055
Down there. Unit 160.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.796
Shit.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.402
You're not supposed to be here.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.819
Hey, lady!

30:37.810 --> 30:39.945
This is my distraction dance.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.195
Now!

30:48.020 --> 30:49.420
No!

30:52.525 --> 30:54.358
- You're hit?
- Twice.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.341
Cole, there's one more.

30:56.366 --> 30:58.730
Go get the box. Go!

31:16.437 --> 31:19.038
It only takes one of...

31:21.888 --> 31:25.322
Four. You're sure there were four?

31:25.324 --> 31:26.724
Yeah.

31:26.726 --> 31:28.585
Go help Jones.

31:29.580 --> 31:32.929
I'd like to speak to
you all about devotion.

31:33.483 --> 31:37.067
We've been promised a
beginning through an end.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.170
For decades, many of us
have lived on Titan...

31:39.172 --> 31:41.038
Why are you taking me back here?

31:41.040 --> 31:43.007
- Outside of everything.
- This...

31:43.009 --> 31:44.308
Guardians of the Red Forest.

31:44.310 --> 31:45.776
... is your moment.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.745
But like the Witness himself,

31:47.747 --> 31:50.481
we are all products of the Great Jinn.

31:50.483 --> 31:53.417
And despite that enormous complexity,

31:53.419 --> 31:55.920
we are present now.

31:55.922 --> 31:57.470
Let's begin.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.256
What is this?

32:31.769 --> 32:35.192
As we prepare for the
Witness's return to us...

32:35.194 --> 32:36.894
the end,

32:36.896 --> 32:38.963
the story of the child begins.

32:38.965 --> 32:40.340
His cycle.

32:40.894 --> 32:43.400
And the child, like the man,
shall be raised through time

32:43.402 --> 32:46.237
so he knows the world in its entirety

32:46.239 --> 32:48.906
and may return to us one day
to lead us to salvation...

32:50.977 --> 32:52.973
The Forest of Red.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.769
Magdalena, it is to you we entrust

33:42.794 --> 33:44.694
the profound responsibility

33:44.696 --> 33:47.830
to guard and raise
the child through time.

33:47.832 --> 33:49.365
No.

34:51.255 --> 34:52.694
Synchronize.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.202
No.

34:59.204 --> 35:01.186
The Witness is safe.

35:01.211 --> 35:03.311
The Witness is safe.

35:03.641 --> 35:05.998
You will see him again.

35:06.778 --> 35:08.654
We honor time

35:09.214 --> 35:11.069
with patience.

35:11.814 --> 35:14.264
James Cole.

35:14.289 --> 35:16.220
Don't worry. You're not going to die...

35:16.245 --> 35:18.381
at least not today.

35:18.606 --> 35:20.039
Who are you?

35:20.064 --> 35:21.730
Oh, we've never met.

35:21.755 --> 35:23.037
And now...

35:24.353 --> 35:25.483
We never will.

36:00.437 --> 36:02.224
What the hell just happened?

36:04.077 --> 36:06.469
This is exactly where we started here...

36:06.471 --> 36:08.123
yesterday.

36:08.596 --> 36:10.600
They reset our timeline.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.787
They're gone.

37:01.481 --> 37:04.035
We're here to take you home, Jennifer.

37:04.691 --> 37:07.050
I'm sorry it's been so long.

37:07.487 --> 37:09.269
We need you.

37:10.355 --> 37:11.931
I need you.

37:15.621 --> 37:17.457
That's much better.

37:36.346 --> 37:38.362
Hi, old girl.

37:39.354 --> 37:41.245
Hiya, scientists.

37:43.253 --> 37:44.682
Dear God.

37:44.684 --> 37:46.331
She's back.

37:47.086 --> 37:49.058
What were they?

37:49.083 --> 37:50.573
Protectors.

37:50.608 --> 37:53.634
"Guardians" seems to be a
more accurate description.

37:53.659 --> 37:55.556
Let's go back earlier. Find them.

37:55.611 --> 37:56.681
We can't.

37:57.565 --> 38:00.081
They possess portable splinter machines.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.329
In the moment of our altercation,

38:03.354 --> 38:06.220
I believe that lone survivor

38:06.245 --> 38:09.362
went back in time and
altered the timeline.

38:09.870 --> 38:12.595
In four months, James Cole will
arrive and discover us here.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.251
You need to alter our
course immediately.

38:14.276 --> 38:15.646
Leave Paris.

38:15.648 --> 38:17.815
Take the Witness to
another point in time.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.374
We will change what we must.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.896
Thank you for your sacrifice.

38:34.117 --> 38:36.318
We leave Paris immediately.

38:36.343 --> 38:37.668
In an instant,

38:37.670 --> 38:40.171
it was as if they were never there.

38:40.196 --> 38:41.806
Neither were we.

38:44.452 --> 38:46.010
Their reset of time splintered us

38:46.035 --> 38:47.701
back to where we started.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.657
These Guardians are unstoppable.

38:52.682 --> 38:54.415
If they see us coming,

38:54.440 --> 38:58.101
they will immediately go back
and rewrite their timeline...

38:59.733 --> 39:01.343
And ours.

39:01.934 --> 39:04.858
So what is it they were protecting?

39:13.648 --> 39:14.949
A child.

39:20.468 --> 39:22.484
Why would the Army of the 12 Monkeys

39:22.509 --> 39:25.062
be protecting a child?

39:25.983 --> 39:27.921
I don't know.

39:27.946 --> 39:29.491
But in her prophecy,

39:29.516 --> 39:32.843
Miss Goines described it as...

39:33.353 --> 39:34.913
as a weapon.

39:37.661 --> 39:39.372
That'll be all.

39:44.395 --> 39:47.114
I'm torn between
sending her back to 2016

39:47.139 --> 39:48.716
and keeping her here.

39:50.570 --> 39:52.834
She's both an asset

39:52.859 --> 39:54.492
and a danger.

39:54.517 --> 39:57.551
I think I'll leave that one up to you.

40:11.285 --> 40:12.858
Hey.

40:15.059 --> 40:17.137
So listen, uh...

40:17.438 --> 40:19.840
about Paris, I just
wanted to say that I, uh...

40:19.865 --> 40:21.269
I know.

40:22.114 --> 40:24.147
You've lost Cassie.

40:25.394 --> 40:27.746
Before Titan, I, um...

40:28.371 --> 40:29.957
I did something.

40:31.442 --> 40:33.475
Undid it.

40:33.477 --> 40:35.310
I didn't realize until afterwards

40:35.312 --> 40:38.914
that I should have made
her part of that decision.

40:38.939 --> 40:41.101
I have to live with that.

40:41.126 --> 40:42.734
And now all I can do is make sure

40:42.759 --> 40:46.351
I don't make that same mistake
with anybody else, so...

40:47.158 --> 40:49.225
I'm asking you.

40:49.250 --> 40:51.627
You want to go home to 2016?

40:51.652 --> 40:54.306
Or do you want to stay here...

40:54.331 --> 40:56.437
and help us?

40:56.969 --> 40:58.569
It's up to you.

40:58.594 --> 41:00.269
Do I want to go home

41:00.271 --> 41:01.937
to lattes, spin class,

41:01.939 --> 41:04.239
and await the inevitable apocalypse

41:04.241 --> 41:06.998
or stay and...

41:07.023 --> 41:08.177
Be part of the team.

41:12.363 --> 41:14.819
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

41:14.844 --> 41:17.111
All right. I'm gonna, uh...

41:17.136 --> 41:18.736
I'm gonna find you a bunk, okay?

41:18.761 --> 41:20.647
- And some... some new clothes.
- Top.

41:20.672 --> 41:22.371
You look like a serving wench.

41:22.373 --> 41:24.874
Oh, by the way...

41:24.876 --> 41:26.676
you were never forgotten.

41:26.678 --> 41:30.422
Hannah even kept your, uh...
your tortoise, Terry, alive.

41:30.447 --> 41:32.961
Damn thing eats better than we do.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.791
I know how you're gonna find her.

41:39.057 --> 41:40.790
How?

41:49.867 --> 41:51.777
Can you feel it?

41:52.937 --> 41:54.731
What?

41:54.756 --> 41:56.311
Cassie.

41:57.012 --> 41:58.887
She's in there.

41:59.505 --> 42:02.172
Everything, everyone...

42:02.174 --> 42:03.870
is in there.

42:08.347 --> 42:11.148
As long as we have this...

42:12.484 --> 42:14.807
we'll never be alone.

42:20.292 --> 42:22.058
Perimeter breach.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.932
- What's going on?
- Holy shit.

42:35.026 --> 42:36.737
Cole!
