10:35.337 --> 10:39.454
You know, grief is actually
built into us neurologically.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.741
That helps me...

10:41.950 --> 10:43.960
Not at all.

10:46.169 --> 10:50.866
Depression is actually a
natural energy-saving mechanism.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.507
You can, um,

10:53.509 --> 10:56.841
feel like you're not really
able to do anything right now,

10:56.843 --> 10:59.866
but really, you're conserving your
energy for when Alex needs you.

11:00.624 --> 11:02.057
If that makes sense.

11:04.066 --> 11:05.567
Charlie?

11:11.710 --> 11:13.640
We just have a flat tire. That's all.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.359
Just a little bump.

11:23.225 --> 11:27.240
All right, we are gonna
have to find a pay phone.

11:27.242 --> 11:28.936
Call a taxi, call a tow truck.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.972
I don't know if we're gonna
have time for everything.

11:30.974 --> 11:32.866
Maybe no piñata, kiddo.

11:33.070 --> 11:35.805
[Monitor beeping steadily]

11:36.376 --> 11:38.343
Dawn, there's something wrong with Alex.

11:38.345 --> 11:41.218
- Charlie, she's out of the woods.
- No, she's not.

11:42.671 --> 11:44.686
- We're about to close.
- Don't.

11:45.484 --> 11:47.217
You missed something.

11:48.653 --> 11:50.390
She's dying.

11:57.636 --> 11:59.749
Let's start walking this way.

12:04.393 --> 12:06.140
I said you missed something.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.298
Charlie, I understand that you are upset,
that she was your fiancée or whatever.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.684
- I-I'm talking to you as a doctor.
-  No, you're not!

12:11.686 --> 12:14.348
You're talking to me
as a frantic, worried person!

12:14.350 --> 12:16.091
Dawn, you missed something, okay?!

12:16.093 --> 12:18.997
I can't concentrate with you
yelling at me like this!

12:18.999 --> 12:22.169
You're talking to me like I am not
trying to save her life, which I am!

12:22.171 --> 12:23.841
- It's not about you!
- Or you!

12:23.843 --> 12:25.347
We're being very thorough, Dr. Harris.

12:25.349 --> 12:27.383
Charlie. You step away
and just let us work.

12:27.385 --> 12:28.765
What if I'm right?

12:32.295 --> 12:34.129
[Sighs]

12:36.429 --> 12:38.780
Is this the crazy
talking-to-yourself kind of thing?

12:38.782 --> 12:40.383
What?

12:41.898 --> 12:43.533
Is it?

12:43.535 --> 12:45.503
What if it is?

12:48.575 --> 12:51.740
Listen, I have the best record in
this hospital. You said so yourself.

12:52.218 --> 12:55.145
Will you just... will you
hear what I have to say?

12:59.590 --> 13:01.471
He's got a vertically unstable pelvis.

13:01.473 --> 13:03.706
We need to put a C-clamp on
him after I reduce the fracture.

13:03.708 --> 13:05.620
- Sounds good, except...
- Except what?

13:05.622 --> 13:08.188
The pressure dressing isn't working.
His blood is not clotting at all.

13:08.190 --> 13:10.659
Whoa. Okay, yeah. We got to
stop the blood flow to his leg.

13:10.661 --> 13:12.213
Uh, have you got a pneumatic tourniquet?

13:12.215 --> 13:14.127
- Not since 1993.
- Okay, you know what?

13:14.277 --> 13:16.211
Put together that C-clamp for me, Zach.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.278
Yeah.

13:18.102 --> 13:19.436
Andrea, give me a hand with this.

13:19.438 --> 13:20.905
Take that.

13:25.381 --> 13:26.981
Nice. Do you want to
start with the fracture?

13:26.983 --> 13:29.366
No, let's stabilize the pelvis first.

13:29.368 --> 13:30.702
He's bleeding from there.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.255
Scalpel.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.316
Wait a minute.

13:42.191 --> 13:43.391
Hemostat.

13:43.916 --> 13:45.249
C-clamp. Let's go.

13:45.510 --> 13:47.700
- You got it?
- Yeah.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.400
[Ian grunts]

13:54.402 --> 13:57.669
What are you doing? Why are you doing this?

13:58.572 --> 14:01.441
[Grunts] Why are you doing this?

14:01.731 --> 14:03.176
We got this, Ian.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.395
I lost my son.

14:06.051 --> 14:07.825
I lost my wife.

14:08.247 --> 14:10.823
- I know, but we're here now, okay?
- I killed someone.

14:10.825 --> 14:14.276
- No, you didn't kill anyone.
- I keep falling asleep.

14:14.278 --> 14:19.398
- It's okay. It's understandable.
- And you keep waking me up.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.427
Joel.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.255
What are we doing?

14:31.061 --> 14:32.929
What are we doing? We're torturing the guy.

14:32.931 --> 14:34.395
Can I have a word?

14:39.803 --> 14:41.104
Do you want to palliate?

14:41.106 --> 14:43.382
Do you honestly he can
survive those injuries?

14:43.887 --> 14:46.685
No. I don't. Nobody
survives an eight-story fall.

14:46.687 --> 14:49.088
- So what are we doing here?
- Everything. That's what we do.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.822
Okay, why? Why?

14:50.824 --> 14:52.755
Because we're doctors.
What do you mean, "why?"

14:52.757 --> 14:54.792
Best-case scenario for this
guy... we get him into the O.R.,

14:54.794 --> 14:56.231
he dies on the table, okay?

14:56.949 --> 14:59.049
Joel, what are you saying?

14:59.051 --> 15:01.567
I'm saying that we should
do the right thing here.

15:02.066 --> 15:04.278
Look at us... we're
waiting around for a miracle

15:04.280 --> 15:05.914
that just isn't gonna happen.

15:06.271 --> 15:08.005
<i>Alex: A couple more things.</i>

15:08.007 --> 15:11.810
Then we can go home and have your party!

15:12.106 --> 15:13.678
Right?

15:13.727 --> 15:15.195
Okay.

15:17.882 --> 15:19.148
Yeah.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.997
Hi. Need a hand with something?

15:22.786 --> 15:24.254
Yeah, I'm looking for, uh, streamers.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.623
- And balloons!
- Balloons.

15:25.942 --> 15:28.659
- They said aisle 4, but...
- Yeah, you're in the right place.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.428
Here, let me get them down for you.

15:31.676 --> 15:33.932
I can't tip you or anything.

15:34.064 --> 15:35.765
Ian: No trouble.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.234
You have a nice smile.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.303
I'm married.

15:40.305 --> 15:43.911
Uh, jumping to some conclusions there.

15:44.141 --> 15:46.042
Sometimes people just do things

15:46.044 --> 15:48.545
out of the goodness of their heart, right?

15:50.480 --> 15:52.148
Not in my experience, no.

15:52.602 --> 15:55.176
We can't carry our burdens alone.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.420
You having a party?

15:58.422 --> 16:00.557
Yes, I'm throwing a
birthday party for my...

16:01.736 --> 16:03.369
Pickle?

16:05.229 --> 16:06.329
Excuse me.

16:07.527 --> 16:09.169
Honey?

16:10.367 --> 16:12.067
Pickle?

16:15.122 --> 16:19.041
Honey, okay, we can't, uh,
play hide-and-seek today, okay?

16:20.375 --> 16:21.442
Pulmonary embolism.

16:21.444 --> 16:22.844
She doesn't have one, but if she does,

16:22.846 --> 16:25.147
it'll show up on imaging, and
we'll deal with it post-op.

16:25.149 --> 16:26.283
Infection?

16:26.285 --> 16:28.073
She did get stabbed with dirty scissors.

16:28.075 --> 16:30.362
Then we'll dose her with
prophylactic pip tazo.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.659
We have been through every
possible complication.

16:32.661 --> 16:34.189
- Deep-vein thrombosis!
- [Laughing] What?!

16:34.191 --> 16:36.206
Just... Dawn, consider it.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.495
No! Because it is asinine.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.362
Am I doing this surgery on an airplane?

16:40.364 --> 16:42.428
Because unless I'm a mile in the sky,

16:42.430 --> 16:45.433
- DVT is virtually impossible.
- Conduction-system injury.

16:45.435 --> 16:46.502
She has good rhythm.

16:46.504 --> 16:47.987
I think we covered our bases, Charlie.

16:47.989 --> 16:50.042
- I'm closing.
- Dawn. Don't.

16:50.044 --> 16:53.049
It is madness to keep her
on the table any longer.

16:53.051 --> 16:56.287
Stop backseat-doctoring,
or I will call security.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.913
- Dr. Bell.
- What?

16:58.915 --> 17:00.882
I'm seeing S.T. elevations.

17:00.983 --> 17:02.783
- You sure?
- Yes.

17:03.207 --> 17:05.340
[Monitor beeping steadily]

17:07.200 --> 17:10.494
Okay, don't you ever,
ever run off on me again!

17:10.497 --> 17:12.916
Do you understand me? You scared
the living daylights out of me.

17:12.919 --> 17:14.717
I thought I'd lost you for good.

17:14.719 --> 17:16.520
[Sighs]

17:17.022 --> 17:18.964
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

17:20.098 --> 17:21.815
[Sighs]

17:21.817 --> 17:23.002
I forgot the piñata.

17:23.137 --> 17:24.069
[Engine idling]

17:24.071 --> 17:25.239
Wait!

17:25.241 --> 17:27.474
No, no, no, no, no, no! Come back!

17:27.477 --> 17:29.178
Wait!

17:29.180 --> 17:31.598
I forgot something!

17:34.014 --> 17:35.919
I forgot something.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.152
Dawn: Her heart's not contracting well.

17:40.154 --> 17:42.378
- Is that normal?
- This is trauma, Charlie.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.925
Nothing is normal, and you know
that. Can I have a head lamp, please?

17:44.927 --> 17:46.694
Reycraft?

17:48.862 --> 17:51.229
Her heart's swelling up.

17:51.231 --> 17:52.566
I don't like it.

17:52.632 --> 17:54.032
Maggie?

17:54.034 --> 17:56.202
I agree. It looks really full.

17:56.268 --> 17:58.203
Okay, it's probably just stunned.

17:58.205 --> 18:00.106
I'm gonna check the arteries.

18:18.974 --> 18:20.658
I stitched her artery shut.

18:20.660 --> 18:21.727
You what?

18:21.729 --> 18:23.761
- I made a mistake.
- How bad?

18:23.763 --> 18:25.597
- It was really bloody in there. It was...
- Don't!

18:26.818 --> 18:29.471
I stitched her main coronary artery shut.

18:29.473 --> 18:31.301
She's having a heart attack.

18:31.899 --> 18:35.276
Most of her heart is not getting
enough blood, and so it's dying.

18:35.278 --> 18:38.370
Okay. Remove the stitches. Try again.

18:38.372 --> 18:40.674
Can't because the tissue is too friable.

18:40.676 --> 18:43.253
- That would destroy her heart.
- Okay, I'm calling a perfusionist.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.915
- Once we get her on pump...
- We don't have time.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.349
What... what, to... to fix it?

18:46.351 --> 18:49.384
To wait. A perfusionist is
gonna be, what, a half-hour?

18:49.386 --> 18:50.661
At least.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.135
We're gonna do a coronary bypass.

18:56.137 --> 18:57.695
On her beating heart?

18:58.926 --> 19:00.196
We can do it.

19:00.198 --> 19:01.765
We have to.

19:37.279 --> 19:39.613
I have your things for you.

19:39.615 --> 19:40.983
[Raspy voice] Thank you.

19:40.985 --> 19:42.052
No problem.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.581
How are you... Feeling? How you doing?

19:44.583 --> 19:46.550
I'm cold.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.653
I'll get you a blanket.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.755
This on you.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.450
Your circulation's probably slowing down.

20:05.452 --> 20:06.630
What does that mean?

20:06.632 --> 20:09.133
Uh, you're not perfusing your organs.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.643
English?

20:11.645 --> 20:15.302
Your organs aren't receiving
the blood that they should.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.130
How does that feel?

20:19.132 --> 20:20.366
Thank you.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.387
It's okay.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.323
Let me give you...

20:24.325 --> 20:28.685
[Sniffs] A little atropine for that rasp.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.651
[Monitor beeps]

20:33.653 --> 20:35.849
Up that fentanyl, too.

20:36.685 --> 20:40.036
What happened... To the doctor I hurt?

20:44.632 --> 20:47.505
She is out of surgery, actually.

20:48.950 --> 20:51.081
- She's okay?
- Yeah. She is.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.584
- [Sighs] That's good.
- Yeah.

20:55.074 --> 20:57.855
She's fine. I think she's gonna
make a full recovery, actually.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.339
She's really okay?

20:59.341 --> 21:02.098
Yeah. She is. Don't
have to worry about her.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.768
She's fine.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.284
Did my ex-wife call?

21:08.612 --> 21:11.237
No, she did not, but...

21:11.239 --> 21:14.864
It's the middle of the
night, so she probably will.

21:15.995 --> 21:19.581
- Sh... I should check his lines?
- No, I got this, Jackson. Thank you.

21:19.583 --> 21:20.416
Okay.

21:20.811 --> 21:22.312
They're driving me crazy!

21:22.314 --> 21:23.981
Okay.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.683
We'll shut these off.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.019
[Beeping stops]

21:29.021 --> 21:30.788
[Exhales sharply]

21:35.093 --> 21:36.565
What are you doing?

21:36.567 --> 21:39.682
I want you to have this.
No, I can't take that, Ian.

21:39.684 --> 21:42.292
I don't have anyone.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.393
I'm here.

21:52.163 --> 21:54.565
I don't blame you.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.338
I'm gonna see my son.

22:02.915 --> 22:04.761
Do you believe that?

22:07.312 --> 22:08.861
Yes.

22:10.265 --> 22:12.690
I really do believe that.

22:15.448 --> 22:16.697
Everything I have...

22:18.689 --> 22:20.322
Is yours.

22:20.324 --> 22:22.257
[Breathing raggedly]

22:38.254 --> 22:40.979
[Monitor beeping steadily]

22:47.496 --> 22:49.163
It's going slow, Dawn.

22:49.165 --> 22:50.839
Tom, take your time.

22:54.604 --> 22:56.839
Charlie, please leave.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.964
I'm not going anywhere.

22:58.966 --> 23:01.612
<i>You are making him nervous.
Hell, you're making me nervous.</i>

23:01.614 --> 23:03.915
<i>Well, now you know how
everyone feels around you.</i>

23:05.946 --> 23:09.206
Besides, with my crazy
talking-to-myself thing,

23:09.208 --> 23:11.744
I'm the only person that's
gonna know if she's better.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.534
She has nice veins.

23:15.536 --> 23:17.089
She has nice legs.

23:17.458 --> 23:20.745
She might want to talk to Dana
about that scar you just gave her.

23:20.747 --> 23:23.561
Eh, I don't think she's gonna
complain when her heart's fixed.

23:23.563 --> 23:26.031
- Guys.
