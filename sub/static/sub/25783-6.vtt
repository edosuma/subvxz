a better channel.

00:15.559 --> 00:17.600

All I'm saying is,

00:30.225 --> 00:32.267
you have to learn
to be a showman, Charles.

That's because the NFL

02:56.725 --> 02:58.933
I just had the weirdest dream
last night.

02:59.017 --> 03:00.559
Did you dream
you were being chased

03:00.641 --> 03:02.058
by giant mini-horses again?

03:02.142 --> 03:03.683
Please, tell me
all about it.

No. I dreamt that
our business cratered.

03:07.142 --> 03:09.017
Yeah. ( imitates explosion )

03:09.100 --> 03:12.225
Hit dead center
by this massive
intergalactic meteor

03:12.309 --> 03:14.808
- made of space trash.
- That wasn't a dream.

03:14.891 --> 03:17.517
And the meteor was
a wrecking ball named Lance.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.600
But that got me
combing through
our remaining roster

03:20.683 --> 03:22.183
looking for some inspiration,

03:22.267 --> 03:24.475
and I came across
these hood rats.

03:24.559 --> 03:25.808
Illegal Civ?

03:25.891 --> 03:27.683
They're actually
kind of charming.

03:27.766 --> 03:30.641
Until that dude
that looks like a chick
pukes on the cop's shoes.

03:30.725 --> 03:33.058
Charming's not usually
a word associated with them.

03:33.142 --> 03:35.475
More like...
an acquired taste.

03:35.559 --> 03:37.100
Like wine.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.766
Necessity breeds invention,
my young friend.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.600
- Joe!
- That's why I came in here.

03:42.683 --> 03:45.017
- Reggie's on his way.
- Reggie!

03:45.100 --> 03:46.600
Hey!

03:46.683 --> 03:48.183
My man. Good to see you.

03:48.267 --> 03:50.392
I was just thinking about you.

03:50.475 --> 03:52.559
Uh-oh. See, we play
this game sometimes:

03:52.641 --> 03:54.392
Guess What Face
Reggie's Making.

03:54.475 --> 03:58.100
Let me guess.
You're in intense pain.

03:58.183 --> 04:00.559
Sizzle and Vern
are fuckin' pissed off.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.725
They got 10 mil
sunk in this shitbox,

04:02.808 --> 04:04.725
and they blaming me
because I told 'em

04:04.808 --> 04:06.933
it was a good idea
to bet on yo' ass.

04:07.017 --> 04:08.434
And I thank you for
the vote of confidence.

04:08.517 --> 04:09.933
Reggie:
Man, fuck you.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.766
They sent me here
to get shit straightened out--

04:11.850 --> 04:13.559
run the numbers,
if you know what I mean.

04:13.641 --> 04:15.475
You're a little skinny
to be an enforcer.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.725
Uh-oh.

04:16.808 --> 04:18.933
Oh! Ha!

04:19.017 --> 04:22.225
Affirmative action
is alive and well here.

04:22.309 --> 04:23.350
( laughs )

04:23.434 --> 04:25.392
- White girl comedy.
- Joe: Yeah.

04:25.475 --> 04:27.309
She should be on Def Jam.

04:29.683 --> 04:31.100
- Not funny.
- Ohh...

04:31.183 --> 04:33.766
Sizzle says
if he loses capital,

04:33.850 --> 04:35.891
he's breakin' fingers,
then legs.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.475
So why don't you tell me
what the fuck
is going on around here?

04:38.559 --> 04:40.017
Everything's
under control here.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.434
Doesn't look like it.

04:41.517 --> 04:42.891
Looks like you
ain't slept in weeks.

04:42.975 --> 04:44.975
Actually, I got
something big.

04:45.058 --> 04:46.267
You're gonna like this.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.183
Since you're an expert
on all things urban,

04:48.267 --> 04:50.975
feast those pretty brown eyes

04:51.058 --> 04:52.434
on these idiots.

04:52.517 --> 04:54.808
Odd Future's ratty
half-brothers?

04:54.891 --> 04:57.267
I'm telling you,
these guys have something.

04:57.350 --> 04:59.225
I've been around superstars
enough to know

04:59.309 --> 05:00.933
what the "it" factor
looks and smells like.

05:01.017 --> 05:03.267
They're raw.
They have an authenticity.

05:03.350 --> 05:06.142
And  they have a merry band
of expanding followers

05:06.225 --> 05:10.475
all between the ages
of shitting in their pants
and studying for midterms.

05:10.559 --> 05:13.058
- I like it.
- I like it too.

05:13.142 --> 05:16.100
Jesse,
where do we find the future?

05:17.517 --> 05:18.975
You ready for this?

05:19.058 --> 05:20.933
( laughs )
Ready for what?

05:21.017 --> 05:23.183
Another meet-and-greet
with a bunch of dudes
wearing windbreakers?

05:23.267 --> 05:25.017
OK, that's good.
Keep your expectations low,

05:25.100 --> 05:26.392
you'll never be disappointed.

05:26.475 --> 05:28.309
I wish that were the case.
They still disappoint.

05:28.392 --> 05:31.100
Whatever it is
we're about to walk into
doesn't really matter to me.

05:31.183 --> 05:32.808
As long as the money's there,
I'll make it work.

06:14.559 --> 06:17.517
Wow. Even by my standards,
this is big, Coach.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.891
We're SC.
It comes naturally.

06:19.975 --> 06:21.641
Coach Davis.

06:21.725 --> 06:24.017
Damn glad to meet you,
Quincy.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.392
Nice to meet you too, Coach.

06:25.475 --> 06:28.475
Shit, we got more.
Take a look up in the sky.

06:34.517 --> 06:36.517
Always wanted to ride
one of them bad boys.

06:36.600 --> 06:41.017
Give me three years,
I'll teach you how
to fly 'em yourself.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.350
Say hello to two-time
Outland Trophy winner
Jono Harvey.

06:44.434 --> 06:46.683
- He's gonna show you around.
- Yo, man.

06:46.766 --> 06:48.766
I'll see you guys around.
Coach, shall we?

06:48.850 --> 06:50.475
Yeah.

06:50.559 --> 06:54.725
So, Mr. Money Manager's
playing the long game.

06:54.808 --> 06:57.808
The game I'm in now
is much bigger than just
repping players.

06:57.891 --> 07:00.766
Besides, I'll never
compromise you like that.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.475
So, Q's family?

07:02.559 --> 07:06.058
Yeah. His mom and I
are dating-ish,

07:06.142 --> 07:09.058
Well, tell Mom she produced
a hell of an offspring.

07:09.142 --> 07:10.891
I will tell her
a legend loves her work.

07:10.975 --> 07:14.434
Now just lay it on me.
Why the house call?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.434
I want the Trojan's TV rights.

07:16.517 --> 07:18.100
That conference deal
was a bust,

07:18.183 --> 07:20.434
and I want to build you guys
your own TV network.

07:20.517 --> 07:22.517
You're not the first
to approach us.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.766
But I am the only one
chaperoning Q.

07:24.850 --> 07:28.267
Why not walk your ass over
and hit the higher-ups?
Go direct?

07:28.350 --> 07:31.434
Because you won four Rose Bowls
and I went to Miami.

07:31.517 --> 07:32.933
( both laugh )

07:33.017 --> 07:35.100
I thought you said
you weren't gonna compromise me.

07:35.183 --> 07:36.850
I'm not gonna
compromise you--

07:36.933 --> 07:38.808
I'm gonna compromise them.

07:42.017 --> 07:43.725
Dennis:
Damn, son, look at you.

07:43.808 --> 07:46.766
Didn't expect to land in Cali
and see you in mid-season form.

07:46.850 --> 07:49.058
- Shit.
- Dr. Larson's right on point.

07:49.142 --> 07:50.517
With all these supplements,
I'm starting to feel

07:50.600 --> 07:51.891
the bounce
coming back, baby.

07:51.975 --> 07:53.309
It's helping
your personality, too.

07:53.392 --> 07:55.017
You're a much more
pleasant person.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.725
Shut the fuck up, man.
Fix my vitamins.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.641
I thought you was done
with the game.

07:59.725 --> 08:02.891
I mean, retirement
was the best decision you made.

08:02.975 --> 08:05.725
Dennis, for most people,
when you leave a gang of
messages for somebody

08:05.808 --> 08:07.891
askin' to visit
and they don't  respond,

08:07.975 --> 08:09.808
that means
"Stay your ass in Miami."

08:09.891 --> 08:11.641
Yeah, but most people
who don't respond

08:11.725 --> 08:15.434
didn't come to the world
via my motherfuckin' nutsack.

08:15.517 --> 08:19.017
Oh! Come on, we don't need
the image of your sweaty old,

08:19.100 --> 08:20.850
saggy-ass ball-sack, Dennis.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.225
- You forgot
to say "big," baby.
- All right.

08:23.309 --> 08:26.017
You might not want
to put the shark cartilage
with the calcium.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.808
That shit'll give you IBS.

08:27.891 --> 08:29.641
That's the least of his problems
if he gonna keep playin'

08:29.725 --> 08:31.517
till he turn into
a bumper sticker.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.475
I never claimed
to be the smartest, Dennis,
just the most committed.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.309
Did you do that down-low
detective work,

08:36.392 --> 08:37.933
see if Charles still stays
at the same spot?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.850
Of course he does.
Nobody's leaving

08:39.933 --> 08:42.017
with all those hot-ass MILFs
roaming around.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.475
Dennis: Why you gotta be
all chauvinistic?

08:43.559 --> 08:45.850
You act like it's
an infestation of zombies.

08:45.933 --> 08:48.267
'Cause it is--
just beautiful ones.

08:48.350 --> 08:50.559
You got a point.
Maybe I'll come.

08:50.641 --> 08:53.683
Nobody needs to see you
or your gray-ass balls, man.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.183
Fuck both of y'all.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.267
Player:
End around! End around!

09:00.933 --> 09:02.891
Practice field
is state-of-the-art,

09:02.975 --> 09:04.600
we got the best turf
money can buy.

09:04.683 --> 09:07.683
As you know, we play
all of our games
on natural grass--

09:07.766 --> 09:09.183
way easier on the knees.

09:09.267 --> 09:11.933
Yeah, I've seen your work.
You got good hands.

09:12.017 --> 09:13.808
- And better feet.
- Thanks, bud.

09:13.891 --> 09:17.517
I heard you were
quite the student
of the game.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.933
Look at this.
Isn't it awesome?

09:20.017 --> 09:24.267
Makes my dick so hard
nearly tears a hole
right through my pants. Ha!

09:25.808 --> 09:27.559
Q likes to focus
on flexibility.

09:27.641 --> 09:30.225
We have the Iron Man
gravity machine for that.

09:30.309 --> 09:32.350
Then we hop
in the Himalayan
Salt Sauna--

09:32.434 --> 09:33.850
sweats out all your toxins.

09:33.933 --> 09:36.309
Just like in Tibet.

09:36.392 --> 09:38.891
Geography thing,
big man.

09:38.975 --> 09:40.559
We got
the best grub, too.

09:40.641 --> 09:42.350
There's this pizza place
that they serve late-night,

09:42.434 --> 09:43.600
and if you wear your hoodie,

09:43.683 --> 09:44.891
they even let players
eat for free.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.392
In my world,
you wear a hoodie late-night

09:46.475 --> 09:48.766
you get shot
or choked out.

09:48.850 --> 09:51.058
Hey, how are the classes?

09:51.142 --> 09:52.850
Thankfully,
I wouldn't know.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.100
We have 24-hour
access to tutors,

09:55.183 --> 09:56.766
they pretty much
cover everything.

09:56.850 --> 09:58.600
Papers, presentations,
shit like that.

09:58.683 --> 10:00.559
Not quite the answer
I was looking for,

10:00.641 --> 10:01.975
but it's all right.

10:02.058 --> 10:03.683
We'll catch up
with you later.

10:05.683 --> 10:07.225
Could you hurry up
and decide already?

10:07.309 --> 10:08.725
We've been here
for 15 minutes.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.017
So many choices.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.725
Do I want sweet
or do I want tart?

10:12.808 --> 10:14.058
It's fucking juice.

10:14.142 --> 10:16.183
Just get what won't
make you throw up.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.475
That's disgusting.

10:17.559 --> 10:19.100
If I wanted a baby
I'd have a baby.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.267
- I wanted a boyfriend.
- ( phone chiming )

10:21.350 --> 10:23.017
Hey, Charles,
how ya doin'?

10:23.100 --> 10:25.017
I can hear that smile
comin' through the cell tower.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.225
Yeah, only for you.

10:27.309 --> 10:29.309
Word on the street is
that you're in town.

10:29.392 --> 10:31.600
For a little guy,
Glazer's got a big mouth.

10:31.683 --> 10:32.975
I didn't say nothin'
about Jay.

10:33.058 --> 10:34.975
But listen up.
I'm hosting

10:35.058 --> 10:37.600
a pre-free agents' dinner
at Nice Guy tonight.

10:37.683 --> 10:39.350
Always one up
on the competition.

10:39.434 --> 10:42.350
A nice guy at the Nice Guy
sounds like a nice time.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.475
- Am I invited?
- Of course!
That's why I'm callin'.

10:45.559 --> 10:49.100
That, and why don't you
bring Kisan by as well?

10:49.183 --> 10:50.641
I'd appreciate that, too.

10:50.725 --> 10:53.808
Oh, I get it. So I'm really
Kisan's plus-one.

10:53.891 --> 10:55.475
You know what
I would appreciate?

10:55.559 --> 10:58.058
If you would reconsider
your stance on Ricky.

10:58.142 --> 11:00.100
Ugh. Him again?
Come on, man.

11:00.183 --> 11:02.309
Remember, he helped the Pats
win a ring.

11:02.392 --> 11:04.808
And don't you forget,
they lost without him.

11:04.891 --> 11:08.100
Well, he's also bipolar.
You left that part out.

11:08.183 --> 11:10.225
If you get caught up in
all these personality profiles,

11:10.309 --> 11:12.434
you're never gonna be able
to field a team.

11:13.975 --> 11:15.641
I'm gonna call Kisan for you.

11:15.725 --> 11:20.309
Just know that he's got
a very  heavy social calendar.

11:20.392 --> 11:24.434
So what's up with the deal?
I'm bored out of my mind.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.808
They're gonna get back to us
by the end of the day.

11:26.891 --> 11:29.017
- You tell 'em no deal, no Q?
- In so many words.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.017
I'm not worried about it.
It's a great all-around deal.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.142
You shouldn't be
worried about it either.
It's gonna be good.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.058
For who?
Who's gettin' paid
and who's gettin' played?

11:35.142 --> 11:36.975
I didn't sign up
for three years of my life

11:37.058 --> 11:39.475
someplace I don't want to be for
less than a significant piece.

11:39.559 --> 11:41.350
- What's my end?
- Ten percent.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.392
Payable when?

11:43.475 --> 11:45.350
In five,
when we sell the whole thing.

11:45.434 --> 11:48.475
Your piece is gonna be worth
somewhere between 50 and 100.

11:48.559 --> 11:51.017
I'll be worth 50 to 100
by then anyway.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.434
Who's sacrificing for me
besides my mom?

11:53.517 --> 11:54.891
What are you  sacrificing?

11:54.975 --> 11:57.850
Agents, boosters,
financial managers--

11:57.933 --> 11:59.850
they been knockin' on my door
since pee wee ball.

11:59.933 --> 12:01.891
- You know what
I told them leeches?
- What?

12:01.975 --> 12:04.350
"Open a paper bag,
fill it with Benjies,
we can have meet."

12:04.434 --> 12:06.808
( laughs ) I get it.
I did the same thing.

12:06.891 --> 12:08.392
- So you know what's up.
- I do.

12:08.475 --> 12:10.975
They got their 15 minutes,
and we got our 10 G's.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.517
Your mom knows?

12:17.100 --> 12:20.058
I don't care how many guys
they send to the league.

12:20.142 --> 12:22.766
And to be honest,
believe it or not,

12:22.850 --> 12:25.434
I'd actually like an education
for three years.

12:25.517 --> 12:28.475
But most of all,
I wanna get paid.

12:28.559 --> 12:30.267
Up front.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.017
That's for real.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.975
( phone chiming )

12:35.600 --> 12:37.267
All right, well,
here we go.

12:37.350 --> 12:39.766
Hey, Coach,
I'm here with Quincy.

12:39.850 --> 12:42.392
He's talkin' about how much
he loves the place.

12:42.475 --> 12:44.017
Great to hear.
Hope it stays that way,

12:44.100 --> 12:46.017
'cause I just got off
with the Board of Regents.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.559
- What'd they say?
- It's a no-go.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.392
Did you say it's a "no"
or it's a "go"?

12:49.475 --> 12:51.100
No, no, no.

12:51.183 --> 12:53.475
I deliver the biggest
piece of talent
in the last 20 years

12:53.559 --> 12:54.933
and a big money offer
for the rights--

12:55.017 --> 12:56.309
what the fuck
are they saying no to?

12:56.392 --> 12:57.309
To you.

12:57.392 --> 12:59.392
What the fuck
does that even mean?

12:59.475 --> 13:01.559
- They said you'd know
what that means.
- Who's "they"?

13:01.641 --> 13:04.434
It's hard to tell sometimes
'cause there's so many of 'em,

13:04.517 --> 13:07.017
but in this case
you can go see Rodney Peete

13:07.100 --> 13:08.808
at the Grand Building.

13:08.891 --> 13:10.434
Rodney Peete?

13:10.517 --> 13:11.850
Yeah, you know him?

13:13.183 --> 13:14.808
Yeah, I know him
all too well.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.434
"Heroines of Cinema Series."

13:30.517 --> 13:33.975
Yeah, they don't get
the love they deserve.

13:34.058 --> 13:37.392
- Alabama Worley,
that's a bad bitch.
- Excuse you?

13:37.475 --> 13:39.683
That's about a woman
right there.

13:39.766 --> 13:41.808
- My bad.
- We're screening films

13:41.891 --> 13:43.891
all with strong female
central characters

13:43.975 --> 13:45.434
in contemporary cinema,

13:45.517 --> 13:47.309
and discussing the way
that men view them.

13:47.392 --> 13:50.142
Kind of a series to create
some gender discourse

13:50.225 --> 13:52.309
and get to the bottom
of male insecurity.

13:52.392 --> 13:54.142
I'm all about
gender discourse.

13:54.225 --> 13:55.600
You're Q.

13:55.683 --> 13:57.350
How you know me?

13:57.434 --> 13:58.850
'Cause I'm the one
who put together

13:58.933 --> 14:00.808
that highlight reel
for your welcome party.

14:00.891 --> 14:02.475
- I'm Emma.
- That was dope,

14:02.559 --> 14:04.392
minus the close-up
of that LB from Bosco

14:04.475 --> 14:05.559
puttin' the hurt on me.

14:05.641 --> 14:06.891
You got rocked.

14:06.975 --> 14:08.309
But you didn't go down.

14:08.392 --> 14:10.808
Q:
So, uh...

14:10.891 --> 14:13.183
you're really into
this film thing, huh?

14:13.267 --> 14:15.100
Yeah. Since forever.

14:15.183 --> 14:16.517
And I'm a football fan.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.350
You want to see
something cool?

14:19.434 --> 14:21.267
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's go.

14:33.058 --> 14:34.017
It never rains in L.A.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.725
Are you committed
to this shit?

14:35.808 --> 14:37.142
Yeah.

14:37.225 --> 14:38.891
- Am I my brother's keeper?
- Yes, I am.

14:38.975 --> 14:40.517
- Say it louder!
- Yes, I am!

14:40.600 --> 14:41.933
Fuckin' right!

14:54.392 --> 14:56.975
You got this.
Get there.
Get there.

14:57.058 --> 14:59.142
Hell, yeah!

15:03.267 --> 15:05.933
Come on, Rick,
let's get out of the rain.

15:08.434 --> 15:09.725
- Look, look, look, look.
- Oh, shit.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.183
Big C!

15:12.267 --> 15:14.100
- What up?
- What's happenin'.

15:14.183 --> 15:16.309
What you doin'
around these parts?

15:16.392 --> 15:18.267
I live just across the way.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.017
Nah. You do? For real?

15:20.100 --> 15:23.267
- Did you know that?
- Am I my brother's keeper?

15:23.350 --> 15:24.808
( chuckling )

15:24.891 --> 15:27.142
If it wasn't for the beard,
driving by,

15:27.225 --> 15:30.392
I coulda sworn Antonio Brown
was snatching a pill
from Big Ben.

15:30.475 --> 15:32.225
I'm workin' my ass off too.

15:32.309 --> 15:34.017
Had to find my flow again.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.683
It wasn't easy,
but I'm back now.
Let's go!

15:37.766 --> 15:40.267
I don't think I've ever
seen you get that low
on your breaks.

15:40.350 --> 15:42.100
My doc got me on
this new vitamin program.

15:42.183 --> 15:44.100
Like legit
fountain of youth.

15:44.183 --> 15:45.766
Gave a brother
a extra inch.

15:45.850 --> 15:50.225
Listen, man, the organization
hasn't forgotten about you.

15:50.309 --> 15:53.017
But just tossin' back and forth
our real off-season needs,

15:53.100 --> 15:57.600
and if the slot wins out,
you could still be our guy.

15:57.683 --> 15:58.975
Yeah.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.225
What you doin' later?
Wanna grab a drink?

16:01.309 --> 16:03.600
I would, but I gotta
go meet up with Mr. Kroenke.

16:03.683 --> 16:06.559
Right. Aight, yeah.
No doubt.

16:06.641 --> 16:08.183
Keep up the good work.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.725
- Get up out the rain.
- All right, dude.

16:10.808 --> 16:11.975
Hold this.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.434
Chuck. Chuck.

16:14.517 --> 16:17.183
I know I messed up
any last chance I had
with that workout,

16:17.267 --> 16:18.975
and I'm pretty sure
you and everybody else

16:19.058 --> 16:20.766
in that Rams facility
probably moved on,

16:20.850 --> 16:23.309
but if there's
anything I can do
for another opportunity,

16:23.392 --> 16:24.933
I'll do that shit.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.517
I'm serious about
suiting up for you
this season.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.725
I'm ready to give my life
on that field, man.

16:29.808 --> 16:32.517
I just want to play
ball again, Chuck.
This is me talkin'.

16:34.975 --> 16:36.309
All right.

16:36.392 --> 16:37.933
I'll keep that in mind.

Remember, they can smell
that corporate shit
a mile away.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.225
Wearing a suit
doesn't make me corporate.

17:17.309 --> 17:18.641
It ain't the suit.

17:18.725 --> 17:20.975
It's that cheesy look
on your face

17:21.058 --> 17:22.559
mixed with that
smell of desperation.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.100
It's not desperation, OK?

17:24.183 --> 17:26.267
That's Tom Ford.
I spent a shitload on it.

17:26.350 --> 17:28.559
Just sayin', they know.

17:28.641 --> 17:30.267
Yo, yo, yo, what up?

17:31.559 --> 17:33.183
My name's Joe Krutel,

17:33.267 --> 17:35.017
this is my associate
Reggie Morris,

17:35.100 --> 17:36.683
we're the new owners
of Sports X.

17:36.766 --> 17:39.058
What the hell
is Sports X?

17:39.142 --> 17:41.392
I thought the dude
that played for the Dolphins
owned Sports X.

17:41.475 --> 17:43.392
I thought you guys
didn't know what Sports X was.

17:43.475 --> 17:47.058
Yeah, let's all have a laugh
on the white guy's expense.

17:47.142 --> 17:48.891
- Very funny.
- Ha ha ha.

17:48.975 --> 17:51.058
Mr. Strasmore
does own the company,

17:51.142 --> 17:54.100
and this square cue-ball dude
over here is the other owner.

17:54.183 --> 17:56.100
- Wait, who are you?
- Yeah, who are you?

17:56.183 --> 17:58.559
I'm the executive
and the head of
the financial group.

17:58.641 --> 18:01.058
And from the real hood,
not this bougie shit.

18:01.142 --> 18:03.392
So you might want
to show a brother
some courtesy and respect.

18:03.475 --> 18:06.142
Look, the only reason
we're still on the roster

18:06.225 --> 18:09.850
is 'cause we haven't
felt like calling
to say we're not on the roster.

18:09.933 --> 18:13.058
Plus, that shit
Lance had us doing
was corny as hell,

18:13.142 --> 18:14.350
and you smell
too much like Lance

18:14.434 --> 18:16.058
to think anything
would be different.

18:16.142 --> 18:18.517
- I'm the guy who fired Lance.
- Mikey: Respect.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.559
You have anything to say
that isn't corporate cookie-
cutter management bullshit?

18:22.641 --> 18:24.392
Lets get something straight,
friend.

18:24.475 --> 18:27.434
Nothin' I do, we do,
is cookie-cutter.

18:27.517 --> 18:30.142
I eat motherfuckin' cookies.
I don't bake 'em.

18:30.225 --> 18:32.891
- He's the motherfuckin'
Cookie Monster.
- That's right.

18:32.975 --> 18:34.808
And everything we do with ASM

18:34.891 --> 18:37.267
and now Sports X
is straight-up nasty.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.933
We handle some of
the biggest, baddest
mofos on the planet.

18:40.017 --> 18:42.559
They make bank,
and they keep it real.

18:42.641 --> 18:44.100
And now we're taking
that philosophy

18:44.183 --> 18:46.434
and applying it
to action sports.

18:46.517 --> 18:48.183
And guess who gets to benefit?

18:48.267 --> 18:50.850
- You guys!
- OK, OK.

18:50.933 --> 18:52.142
We'll listen,

18:52.225 --> 18:54.933
but I think we hear
a whole lot better

18:55.017 --> 18:56.600
with food in our stomachs.

18:56.683 --> 19:00.683
- Do you know Roscoe's?
- Roscoe's is my joint.

19:00.766 --> 19:04.142
- So you do know where it is.
- Yeah, Manchester and Main.

19:04.225 --> 19:05.309
( laughing )

19:05.392 --> 19:07.808
How about you two
go get us three

19:07.891 --> 19:09.350
some food for dinner tonight?

19:09.434 --> 19:11.517
- Yeah. Done.
- Cool.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.641
See you soon.

19:13.725 --> 19:16.891
- He just try
to pull the Roscoe card?
- Yeah!

19:16.975 --> 19:19.850
I felt like he's trying
to revoke my black card.

19:22.183 --> 19:24.683
You blew the over-and-under.
I had you arriving
a minute earlier.

19:24.766 --> 19:27.142
Save the jokes and quips.
It's bad enough
you screwed my brother,

19:27.225 --> 19:28.434
now you're trying
to screw me?

19:28.517 --> 19:30.559
Nobody's trying
to screw you, Spencer.

19:30.641 --> 19:32.309
Lose the paranoia.
I knew this was

19:32.392 --> 19:33.725
the only way
you'd come see me.

19:33.808 --> 19:34.808
OK, great.
Well, here I am.

19:34.891 --> 19:35.933
Now let's cut the bullshit.

19:36.017 --> 19:37.183
What are they
gonna cost me?

19:37.267 --> 19:38.475
We need to discuss
something first.

19:38.559 --> 19:39.641
If we're not
discussing rights,

19:39.725 --> 19:40.933
we're not
discussing anything.

19:41.017 --> 19:43.975
You sure? No interest
in historical accuracy?

19:44.058 --> 19:45.683
Well, it sounds like
you're about to rewrite it.

19:45.766 --> 19:47.850
I been around this program
a long time.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.975
I came back here
after I was done playin',

19:50.058 --> 19:51.600
I know where
all the bodies are buried,

19:51.683 --> 19:53.017
and let me tell you something--

19:53.100 --> 19:56.766
nobody here ever tried
to screw your family, Spencer.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.600
The goddamn lies,
they never stop!

19:58.683 --> 20:00.683
- Your brother had problems.
- The problem was

20:00.766 --> 20:02.434
you replaced him
when he blew out his shoulder

20:02.517 --> 20:03.933
winning you guys
a goddamn Rose Bowl!

20:04.017 --> 20:05.392
Yeah, and I felt bad
about that.

20:05.475 --> 20:06.559
I didn't expect
to take over

20:06.641 --> 20:08.392
until he was done playing.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.850
That was always the plan!

20:09.933 --> 20:12.058
- That was bullshit.
- It's the truth.

20:12.142 --> 20:13.725
You know what else?
It was losing

20:13.808 --> 20:16.183
that year of eligibility
that really fucked him.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.183
The NCAA ruled against him!

20:18.267 --> 20:20.517
We, they, everybody else
wanted him back!

20:20.600 --> 20:22.725
- How you know that?
- I did a little research.

20:22.808 --> 20:24.808
Maybe out of guilt,
but I found out

20:24.891 --> 20:27.100
that the school backed William!

20:27.183 --> 20:29.267
They tried to reinstate him!

20:29.350 --> 20:32.392
But in the end,
the NCAA won out.

20:32.475 --> 20:33.891
They always do.

20:33.975 --> 20:36.517
William couldn't handle it,
started droppin' Vikes.

20:38.808 --> 20:41.142
My brother was depressed.
He wasn't an addict.

20:41.225 --> 20:42.683
You got that backwards, too.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.392
Dude ate pills
like Gummy Bears.

20:44.475 --> 20:46.309
OK, so what's the point?

20:46.392 --> 20:49.309
My point is,
the system screwed William,

20:49.392 --> 20:50.975
not the university.

20:51.058 --> 20:53.475
I need you to know that
before we go any further.

20:53.559 --> 20:56.475
The FBS, the NCAA, the CFP,

20:56.559 --> 20:57.975
just a bunch of goddamn letters

20:58.058 --> 21:00.392
hiding the kids who are
putting in the real work,

21:00.475 --> 21:02.517
who are sacrificing
their bodies,

21:02.600 --> 21:03.766
sacrificing their minds,

21:03.850 --> 21:05.559
they're not getting paid
a goddamn thing,

21:05.641 --> 21:08.392
just for the right
to call themselves
a scholar-athlete.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.766
The whole goddamn system
is a scam!

21:10.850 --> 21:12.434
I feel your pain, brother.

21:12.517 --> 21:14.100
But your anger
needs to be directed

21:14.183 --> 21:16.683
at Indianapolis--
not here at SC.

21:16.766 --> 21:19.434
I'm not taking no
for an answer.
I want the TV rights.

21:19.517 --> 21:22.434
Otherwise you're gonna be
watching Q play up in Eugene
for the Ducks.

21:22.517 --> 21:24.933
- Your call.
- $200 million.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.058
That's the market price
for a ten-year deal
with us these days.

21:28.142 --> 21:31.267
( sighs ) Thank you
for the conversation.

21:31.350 --> 21:34.225
You go fuck yourself,
and I hope you have
a great flatscreen

21:34.309 --> 21:35.725
to watch that shit.

21:38.725 --> 21:41.683
( music, chatter )

21:46.975 --> 21:48.891
Is hosting always
this stressful, Vern?

21:48.975 --> 21:52.850
I don't know. I usually
let Reggie handle
all the festivities.

21:52.933 --> 21:55.225
You think the other players
will show up?

21:55.309 --> 21:56.641
Of course, man.

21:56.725 --> 21:58.600
Don't sweat it.
Everybody love you, Chuck.

21:58.683 --> 22:01.183
Thanks, man. It's just
this is the first thing
that I hosted

22:01.267 --> 22:04.559
besides them little barbecues
me and Julie do at the crib.

22:04.641 --> 22:06.850
- I'm gonna give you
one bit of advice.
- What's that?

22:06.933 --> 22:10.142
- Make sure you
pick up the tab.
- Yeah, thanks.

22:10.225 --> 22:13.100
Vern: J and Ricky are here.
I told you people would come.

22:15.183 --> 22:18.183
( chatter )

22:18.267 --> 22:20.850
- Fellas.
- The host with the most.

22:20.933 --> 22:22.475
( whispers )
I'm gonna kill you.

22:22.559 --> 22:24.392
Ricky. Twice in one day.

22:24.475 --> 22:26.017
Where's Mr. Kroenke?

22:26.100 --> 22:27.725
Hey, I'm sorry,

22:27.808 --> 22:29.725
uh, you know,
he probably--

22:29.808 --> 22:31.975
It's all good, Charles.
No need to apologize.

22:32.058 --> 22:34.850
- I'm just here
for the truffle fries.
- And the pre-free agent dinner.

22:34.933 --> 22:37.475
What the hell would I know
about free agency, anyway?

22:37.559 --> 22:40.267
- You are one?
- That's right, I am!

22:40.350 --> 22:42.350
Hey, Laurel and Hardy,
shut the fuck up.

22:42.434 --> 22:45.850
You don't have to jam me up
and make me feel uncomfortable
at my own damn party.

22:45.933 --> 22:49.183
- What's wrong with y'all?
- What an asshole.

22:49.267 --> 22:50.641
Get some truffle fries, Rick!

22:50.725 --> 22:52.017
Relax.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.766
You got some twisted
business practices, J!

22:53.850 --> 22:55.808
Don't worry,
you'll get used to them.

22:55.891 --> 22:58.100
I hope not,
damnit.

22:58.183 --> 22:59.975
I take care of my friends,
all right?

23:00.058 --> 23:01.350
Maybe you should try
doing the same.

23:01.434 --> 23:04.392
Why don't you go
chat up Kisan.

23:04.475 --> 23:05.683
What about Ricky?

23:05.766 --> 23:07.267
We're here
for the same thing.

23:08.850 --> 23:10.434
( whispering ) Now. Now.

23:12.183 --> 23:16.058
Jared, hey, I want to introduce
you to my favorite person.

23:16.142 --> 23:17.766
- All right.
- Come here.

23:17.850 --> 23:19.434
Ricky!

23:19.517 --> 23:21.183
I just said Manchester and Main.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.641
They were like, "Uh?! No!"

23:23.725 --> 23:24.933
( laughs )

23:25.017 --> 23:26.641
Fuck with me.

23:28.017 --> 23:31.808
Ohh, god-fuckin'-damnit!

23:34.891 --> 23:37.475
So this is what
legitimate business
is like.

23:37.559 --> 23:39.559
Gotta take the good
with the bad, Reg.

23:39.641 --> 23:42.058
Ain't all champagne
and caviar.

23:42.142 --> 23:44.142
I don't do no fish eggs.

23:44.225 --> 23:46.225
But I'm starting
to feel like...

23:46.309 --> 23:48.058
handling Vernon's laundry

23:48.142 --> 23:50.725
is better than
taking these punks around.

23:50.808 --> 23:54.183
Oh, this just comes
with the territory, man.

23:54.267 --> 23:57.058
Rejection is
a daily emotion for me.

23:58.434 --> 24:00.891
Something I don't
want to feel.

24:02.725 --> 24:04.517
So what now?

24:04.600 --> 24:06.766
We go and, what,
put a hit out on 'em?

24:06.850 --> 24:09.017
( laughs )

24:09.100 --> 24:11.350
No. No.

24:11.434 --> 24:14.267
We do what I did
when I was pursuing
my dead wife

24:14.350 --> 24:16.142
and she said no.

24:16.225 --> 24:18.058
Go back for more.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.350
Man, hand me
the hot sauce.

24:28.975 --> 24:30.725
I forgot it.

24:35.225 --> 24:36.641
Good times, baby.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.100
I don't usually get out
to these functions that often.

24:39.183 --> 24:41.850
I'm home in bed by like 9:00,
watching Raging Bull

24:41.933 --> 24:43.517
or Harry Potter  or something.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.559
Did you say Harry Potter?
No shit?!

24:45.641 --> 24:47.183
- Yeah, man.
- I seen all  those movies.

24:47.267 --> 24:48.683
- Really?
- Swear to God.

24:48.766 --> 24:51.475
We should get together
and watch Harry Potter.

24:51.559 --> 24:53.641
- Yeah, man, let's do it.
- For real?

24:53.725 --> 24:55.142
You got a magic wand?

24:55.225 --> 24:57.600
- ( Jared, Ricky laughing )
- Jason: Hey.

24:59.392 --> 25:01.225
This franchise is
the future of the league,

25:01.309 --> 25:02.975
and Charles is
just the guy to guide it.

25:03.058 --> 25:06.392
That's nice of you to say, J.
Things are coming together.

25:06.475 --> 25:09.683
And the stadium's gonna be
the eighth wonder of the world,
believe me.

25:09.766 --> 25:10.641
Congrats on that.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.475
I can't lie to you, though,

25:12.559 --> 25:14.517
I don't really give a shit
about stadiums

25:14.600 --> 25:16.475
and skyboxes
and all that shit.

25:16.559 --> 25:18.933
I'm a football player,
not a real estate developer.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.350
- I get it, I get it.
- But congrats, though.

25:21.434 --> 25:23.225
I was a ballplayer too,
remember?

25:23.309 --> 25:25.142
Just wanted to give you a feel
for where we're going.

25:25.225 --> 25:27.017
Right. I want to give you
a feel, too.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.434
I'm not feelin'
that move to slot.

25:29.517 --> 25:32.183
- Really?
- At all, actually.

25:32.267 --> 25:34.183
- Why not?
- It's like I said,

25:34.267 --> 25:35.850
I'm all about the game,

25:35.933 --> 25:37.267
and the more I thought about it,

25:37.350 --> 25:38.725
I started to realize

25:38.808 --> 25:40.850
that I was born a running back,

25:40.933 --> 25:42.683
I am  a running back,

25:42.766 --> 25:44.933
and Lord willing,
I'm gonna die a running back.

25:45.017 --> 25:47.058
- A great running back.
- Damn right.

25:47.142 --> 25:48.392
What about career longevity?

25:48.475 --> 25:50.100
Never really planned on

25:50.183 --> 25:52.808
playing longer than seven,
eight seasons, maybe.

25:52.891 --> 25:54.933
I'm taking a page
out of Barry Sanders' book.

25:55.017 --> 25:57.058
That's why he needs
to get paid now.

25:57.142 --> 25:58.517
Exactly, super agent.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.517
So if y'all got a spot at back,

26:00.641 --> 26:02.434
and you can afford me,

26:02.517 --> 26:03.559
holla at J.

26:03.641 --> 26:05.975
Him and Gurley--
shock and awe.

26:06.058 --> 26:08.267
- It's perfect.
- Kisan: For real, no doubt.

26:08.350 --> 26:10.725
- I'm out of here, all right?
- All right.

26:10.808 --> 26:13.517
My girl, she want
bottle service.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.683
And that shit, in L.A.,
ain't cheap.

26:15.766 --> 26:19.559
Y'all think about that
when y'all talkin'
them numbers, a'ight?

26:19.641 --> 26:21.766
- Play nice. I'm outta here.
- K.T.!

26:24.183 --> 26:25.975
- I'm done!
- Chill.

26:26.058 --> 26:28.100
Things have never been better.
Take a look.

26:28.183 --> 26:32.100
Yeah, yeah,
real love connection
with those two.

26:32.183 --> 26:35.559
They were meant to be together.
Just put Rick at the slot.

26:35.641 --> 26:37.434
I can't afford to do that.

26:37.517 --> 26:40.183
You've done great.
Take a bow.

26:40.267 --> 26:41.559
Don't fight it.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.309
All right, fine,
I'll take Ricky.

26:43.392 --> 26:45.850
But it's on you
to make Kisan understand
this position thing

26:45.933 --> 26:47.309
and make the money work,
all right?

26:47.392 --> 26:48.850
Consider it done.

26:51.017 --> 26:53.725
Woman in movie:
Stop being so
fucking calm about it!

26:53.808 --> 26:55.766
Go look in your house!
There's a note on your TV.

26:55.850 --> 26:58.350
All it says is "Dear Clarence."
I couldn't write anymore.

27:00.475 --> 27:03.225
( movie audible in distance )

27:07.559 --> 27:11.808
- Man: What's a Drexl?
- Woman: Sheriff,
I gotta come clean!

27:11.891 --> 27:14.100
I've been a call girl
for exactly four days...

27:14.183 --> 27:15.600
Close the door, dude.

27:15.683 --> 27:17.267
- What the fuck?
- Calm down, kid.

27:17.350 --> 27:19.100
- Yo, Q! Q.
- Viewers: Shh! Shh!

27:19.183 --> 27:20.766
- Shut up. Q.
- Shit.

27:20.850 --> 27:23.975
Sorry. It's a fuckin' movie,
OK?

27:25.434 --> 27:27.058
I'll be right back.

27:30.309 --> 27:31.850
This is my favorite part.

27:31.933 --> 27:34.058
You're fuckin'
with my vibe.

27:34.142 --> 27:35.975
What the fuck is your vibe?

27:36.058 --> 27:38.225
Fuckin' movie night on campus?

27:39.641 --> 27:41.350
Hey. You need to chill.

27:41.434 --> 27:43.641
You're in the presence
of greatness.

27:43.725 --> 27:45.850
Steven Spielberg
built these prestigious halls.

27:45.933 --> 27:47.641
George Lucas,
Ryan Coogler,
Ron Howard,

27:47.725 --> 27:48.850
they all went here.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.475
And now
Quincy Crawford will too.

27:50.559 --> 27:52.725
Don't get too attached,
cause I got bad news.

27:52.808 --> 27:54.100
I couldn't make the deal.
