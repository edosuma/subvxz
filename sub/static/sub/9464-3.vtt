-What is it? What's wrong?
You okay?

20:38.041 --> 20:40.458
-Ah, yeah.
-What's happening?

20:40.500 --> 20:43.417
-Would you mind just...Sitting
there while I finish my soup?

20:43.458 --> 20:45.792
-Ohh, like a little lunchtime
together.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.166
-Mmm.
-I'd love that. We haven't had
lunch together for ages.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.375
-You don't have to say anything,
you could just sit there.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.875
-Okay, I should get my lunch and
then we could actually eat...

20:52.917 --> 20:55.834
-Mmm mm, mmm mm.
-Is there something on my top?

20:55.875 --> 20:58.583
[Laughs]: Nope.
