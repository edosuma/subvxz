00:17.291 --> 00:19.917
( theme music playing )

00:26.667 --> 00:28.250
( whistles )

00:49.500 --> 00:51.291
Murray:
Okay, band meeting.

00:51.291 --> 00:54.041
Murray, present.
Bret, present.
Mm-hmm.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.834
Jemaine, present.
All right,

00:55.834 --> 00:57.458
I haven't got time
for your time wasting.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.291
Today I've got
to move fast.

00:59.291 --> 01:00.834
We've got some
really good news.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.125
We've got our
biggest gig ever.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.625
Is it
the Grand Canyon one?

01:04.625 --> 01:06.709
No, there's no gigs
at the Grand Canyon.

01:06.709 --> 01:08.834
Wouldn't have to be
that big to be our
biggest gig ever.

01:08.834 --> 01:11.667
Okay, enough guesses.
I'm gonna tell you.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.959
You ready?
Jemaine: Mm-hmm.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.917
Ah... Central Park.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.125
Central Park?
Yes.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.959
Really?
Confirmed this morning.

01:19.959 --> 01:22.417
Headlining.
Headlining
at Central Park?

01:22.417 --> 01:23.667
Yes.
Us?

01:23.667 --> 01:25.250
Yes.
Me and Bret?

01:25.250 --> 01:27.166
Yes!
Jemaine: Bret as well?

01:27.166 --> 01:28.375
Yes, the two of you.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.458
As-- as you are,
okay?

01:30.458 --> 01:32.542
I mean, you've got to be
on the top of your game,

01:32.542 --> 01:35.917
which is why I've booked
us into a warm-up tour.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.333
Here's your
itineraries.

01:39.542 --> 01:42.500
Murray, you said
we couldn't afford
to go on tour.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.875
Well, I've said a lot
of things in my time, Bret.

01:44.875 --> 01:48.000
Not all of it's
worth listening to,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.625
but let's just say
this time around, it is.

01:50.625 --> 01:54.917
I've dipped into
the Flight of the
Conchords Emergency Fund.

01:54.917 --> 01:56.208
What emergency fund?

01:56.208 --> 01:58.333
Well, I'm not really
at liberty to say,

01:58.333 --> 01:59.750
but...

01:59.750 --> 02:02.875
Okay?

02:02.875 --> 02:05.500
Where'd you get
that from, Murray?
Don't worry about it.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.583
Well, whose money is it?
I'm not at liberty to say.

02:07.583 --> 02:09.792
Just, don't worry
about it.

02:09.792 --> 02:12.709
Murray, have you
organized a tour before?

02:12.709 --> 02:15.625
Yes, of course I have.
What do you think this is?

02:15.625 --> 02:17.834
Was it a band tour?

02:17.834 --> 02:19.458
A rugby tour...

02:19.458 --> 02:21.083
I've organized.
Same thing.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.834
Not really.
Yes.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.750
Players play the game,
you guys play the guitar.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.625
Don't they?
They kick the ball,
you kick the... jams.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.083
So we have to get up
at 7:00 in the morning

02:32.083 --> 02:33.875
and do
200 squat-thrusts?

02:33.875 --> 02:36.875
Oh no, some of these
won't, um, apply to you.

02:36.875 --> 02:39.291
Just look for the ones I've--
I've crossed out there,

02:39.291 --> 02:41.083
and I've put red pen.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.583
Look for the red pen
instructions.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.625
How big's
the bus gonna be?
The tour bus?

02:51.625 --> 02:53.417
This is the tour bus,
Jemaine.

02:53.417 --> 02:55.417
Jemaine:
This isn't a tour bus.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.417
It says here we're
gonna have a tour bus.

02:57.417 --> 02:59.959
No, that's the rugby
itinerary, isn't it?

02:59.959 --> 03:01.583
All right,
there's only two of you.

03:01.583 --> 03:04.000
You're not a big rugby team,
you don't need a bus.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.792
Oh, I thought we were
getting a tour bus.

03:05.792 --> 03:09.125
No, that's the rugby
itinerary, Bret.
All right?

03:09.125 --> 03:11.458
You can see there
I've crossed out "bus,"
haven't I?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.917
Yeah, you crossed out "bus,"
and you wrote "bus."

03:13.917 --> 03:16.917
Yeah, I got confused there.
I didn't know what to do.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.083
"Honda Accord" was too big
to fit in the gap there,

03:19.083 --> 03:20.750
so I put "bus" back in.

03:20.750 --> 03:24.750
I knew as soon as
I wrote it, there'd be
some sort of controversy.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.333
Let me tell you
a little secret, Bret.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.417
You'll like this.

03:35.417 --> 03:38.625
Sometimes late at night
when I'm driving alone,

03:38.625 --> 03:41.458
I imagine
this is a bus.

03:41.458 --> 03:44.041
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.875
Is that-- a bit silly,
is it, Bret?

03:45.875 --> 03:47.917
No, that's cool.
Is it?

03:47.917 --> 03:50.166
Mmm.
I thought
you'd like that.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.917
So you're
the bus driver?
Yeah.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.458
That's cool.

03:53.458 --> 03:56.125
( cell phone ringing )
Oh.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.667
Shelly.

03:58.667 --> 03:59.917
Oh, how's Shelly?

03:59.917 --> 04:01.667
I thought
you were separated.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.625
No, we're back
together, remember?

04:03.625 --> 04:05.291
You asked me
why I was crying.

04:05.291 --> 04:07.041
I said it was
the happiest day
of my life.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.959
( phone ringing )
You don't remember that?

04:09.959 --> 04:11.792
Mm-mm, no.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.834
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you?

04:13.834 --> 04:14.917
What?

04:14.917 --> 04:17.709
Uh, no, it was
an emergency.

04:17.709 --> 04:21.625
Look, it's a temporary
withdrawal from the
checking fund, all right?

04:21.625 --> 04:24.583
The savings
should be okay.

04:24.583 --> 04:27.250
Right. No, yeah,
okay, so I--

04:27.250 --> 04:29.959
I transferred most
of the savings into
the checking account.

04:29.959 --> 04:31.667
But look, it's just
temporary, all right?

04:31.667 --> 04:33.417
We'll get it back.
Don't worry.

04:33.417 --> 04:35.750
We'll-- we will.
We will get it back.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.041
We'll get it
back, okay?

04:38.041 --> 04:39.834
We will!

04:39.834 --> 04:41.417
Say hi from me.

04:41.417 --> 04:42.875
( silent )

04:42.875 --> 04:44.834
What?
No.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.834
Look, Shelly,

04:46.834 --> 04:50.333
those two effing idiots
are good friends
of mine, okay?

04:50.333 --> 04:53.250
And no, they're not--
It's nothing to do
with them, okay?

04:53.250 --> 04:54.875
I'm not even
managing them anymore.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.041
( silent )

04:56.041 --> 04:59.000
Look, I've got to go.
Bret says hi.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.458
I mean, ages ago,
when I last saw him.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.375
All right?
All right, bye-bye.

05:04.375 --> 05:05.875
Is everything
all right, Murray?

05:05.875 --> 05:07.625
Absolutely, yeah.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.375
That reminds me--
Jemaine?

05:10.458 --> 05:12.041
Jemaine?

05:12.041 --> 05:14.458
Are your immigration papers
up to date?

05:14.458 --> 05:16.542
Well, that's your job to
check our immigration papers.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.375
I don't know.
Yeah, right,
well anyway...

05:18.375 --> 05:20.792
I'm just wondering
'cause there's been
a car tailing us

05:20.792 --> 05:22.208
for the last hour.

05:22.208 --> 05:25.375
It's probably Mel
stalking us.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.542
( chuckles )

05:26.542 --> 05:28.500
Mel:
Well, hey, guys!

05:28.500 --> 05:30.583
What a coincidence!

05:30.583 --> 05:33.000
Ha ha!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.959
Hey, Mel.

05:36.083 --> 05:39.250
( classic rock music
playing )

06:01.125 --> 06:03.542
Jemaine:
What time do we take off?

06:03.542 --> 06:05.834
Murray: What do you mean?
What time's our flight?

06:05.834 --> 06:08.125
( laughs )
We're not flying anywhere.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.083
Why are we
at an airport?

06:10.083 --> 06:11.375
That's where
the gig is, Jemaine.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.291
It's
at the airport.
At the airport?

06:13.291 --> 06:15.750
Yeah, well here,
at the hotel...

06:15.750 --> 06:17.417
in the lounge.

06:17.417 --> 06:19.500
Come on, it's time
for the gig.
Let's go.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.458
♪ Who likes
to rock the party? ♪

06:21.458 --> 06:24.041
both:
♪ We like to rock
the party ♪

06:24.041 --> 06:26.250
( music stops )

06:27.959 --> 06:29.750
Um, well thank you
very much,

06:29.750 --> 06:33.875
um, to the La Guardia
Hotel lobby...

06:33.875 --> 06:35.500
Um...
Shut up, Bret.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.208
Uh, thank you
for having us.
It's been a real treat.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.291
And thank you
just for being here.

06:40.291 --> 06:41.959
Don't-- don't do your
embarrassing speeches.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.667
We're Flight
of the Conchords,

06:43.667 --> 06:45.125
and thank you again.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.458
Thank you. CDs and
T-shirts are for sale
at the desk there.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.542
( plane lands )

06:51.542 --> 06:53.125
Well?
Brilliant.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.875
Yeah?
Yeah,
as always.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.458
Really good.
Good speech too, Bret.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.208
Thanks, it was all right.
Yeah. What a night, eh?

06:59.208 --> 07:01.250
Well, it's only the middle
of the afternoon, though.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.583
So? You know,
it's a hot venue.
Jemaine: Oh, yeah yeah.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.875
Yeah? This is good.
Listen to the crowd.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.500
There's hardly
anyone here.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, it's subsided now.
A lot of people have...

07:12.000 --> 07:13.500
gone
to get their flights,

07:13.500 --> 07:15.834
but it's really good.
Oh, before I forget.

07:15.834 --> 07:18.500
Uh, I've got
your per diems, okay?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.834
So, here we go.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.166
Jemaine.
Oh, great.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.959
Yeah. Bret.

07:23.959 --> 07:26.000
Okay?
Off you go.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.667
I'll see you in
an hour for dinner.

07:27.667 --> 07:30.041
Thanks, Murray.
Have fun.

07:32.834 --> 07:35.125
And the point of
a per diem, as I think
I made quite clear,

07:35.125 --> 07:38.333
is that it's to be spent
on food and necessary
items, all right?

07:38.333 --> 07:41.375
Not leather suits.
It's a total waste of money.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.875
It's necessary for...

07:42.875 --> 07:45.667
Now you've got
no money for food...

07:45.667 --> 07:47.750
or necessary items.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.208
( plane lands )

07:51.208 --> 07:54.542
Perhaps you could
give us an advance
on tomorrow's per diem?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.959
You've spent
tomorrow's per diem.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.959
The per diem I gave you
for was for the week.

07:57.959 --> 08:00.291
Could I have
some of your chips
please, Murray?

08:00.291 --> 08:01.750
You can have
a few of them.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.625
"Per diem" means
for the day, though. See?

08:03.625 --> 08:05.375
Well, I don't
know Latin.

08:05.375 --> 08:06.917
Well, you should have
said-- "per weekem,"

08:06.917 --> 08:09.125
would be the correct term.
Regardless, Jemaine.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.875
Per diem, per weekem,
you don't go spending it
on bloody leather suits.

08:11.875 --> 08:14.333
Don't you?
No!

08:14.333 --> 08:18.083
Can I have some
of the chips that
you said Bret could have?

08:18.083 --> 08:20.709
Bret!

08:20.709 --> 08:23.125
Oh, do you want
some of my chips?

08:23.125 --> 08:25.166
Oh, forget it now.
They're yours now.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.000
Hey, Murray, do you want
to see what else we got?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.291
No, I don't, Bret,
actually.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.208
I don't want
to see anything
you've got there

08:30.208 --> 08:32.041
unless it's food
or necessary items.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.834
I'm so livid
with you turkeys.

08:34.834 --> 08:39.750
You're like a couple
of cool-looking idiots.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.625
We'll get it back.
We will get it back,
all right?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.458
Just call me tomorrow,
but don't call me at work.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.500
Do not  call me
at work, all right?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.792
I don't want them asking
silly questions as to why
I'm not at work, okay?

08:52.792 --> 08:55.083
It's just
gonna get like--

08:55.083 --> 08:57.583
Hello? Hello?

08:59.041 --> 09:02.291
Okay, love you too!
Bye-bye!

09:02.291 --> 09:04.417
Hey, Bret.
That Shelly?

09:04.417 --> 09:05.542
Yeah, yeah.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.625
She good?
Yeah, it's all good.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.125
( sighs )

09:09.125 --> 09:11.375
Jemaine said you wanted
to have a meeting?

09:11.375 --> 09:14.583
Um, nothing's scheduled.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.125
Is it about
leather suits?

09:16.125 --> 09:17.959
I don't blame you
for the leather suits, Bret.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.125
That's a classic
rock 'n' roll move.
Thank you.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.625
Really good.
Thanks.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.000
Which is why I know
Jemaine came up with it.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.250
No.
Yeah.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.041
You must have
followed him, did you?

09:26.041 --> 09:28.417
What, don't you think
I'm capable of a classic
rock 'n' roll move?

09:28.417 --> 09:30.291
No, not like that.
That's Jemaine all over it.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.667
That reminds me,

09:31.667 --> 09:33.500
just, you know, keep
an eye on Jemaine, okay?

09:33.500 --> 09:36.709
We're on tour now.
Brings out the crazier side
of someone like him.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.917
Okay.
Okay, just watch him.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.709
All right, well,
he's having a sleep.

09:40.709 --> 09:41.792
Oh, is he?
Yeah.

09:41.792 --> 09:44.417
Probably not his bed,
though? Eh?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.792
Yes, his bed.
Is it?

09:45.792 --> 09:47.834
Yeah.
But he'd be lying
on top of it, though.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.291
He won't be--
won't be in it.
He'll be on top...

09:50.291 --> 09:51.750
No, he's tucked in.
It's boring.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.333
Oh, is he?
Yeah.

09:53.333 --> 09:56.208
Probably, uh,
he's having a rest.
Getting ready for tonight.

09:56.208 --> 09:59.208
He was watching TV.
He wanted to see what
the weather was gonna be like.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.667
Oh, wow.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.166
Probably looking
for some thunderstorms
to rock out in.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.333
You watch him,
all right?

10:05.333 --> 10:07.583
( big band music playing )
Jemaine: Oh, it's hilarious.

10:07.583 --> 10:11.041
Oh, you've got to see this,
Bret, it's so-- so funny.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.500
What's happening?

10:12.500 --> 10:15.000
Uh, well the guys with
the suits are putting on
this big show now,

10:15.000 --> 10:16.417
and everyone's
just loving it.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.417
No, don't move it,
don't move it.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.583
Gotta be in exactly
the right place.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.250
It's your turn
to hold it, man.
My arms are sore.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.250
I can't hold it.
I'm in the middle
of a movie.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.000
This is
a critical point.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.125
Aw. You ruined
the reception.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.625
Do you want anything
from the minibar?

10:30.625 --> 10:31.834
No.
No?

10:31.834 --> 10:33.667
We're not allowed stuff
from the minibar.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.959
Yeah, I know, but--
Jemaine, do not get
anything from the minibar.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.709
Just getting some nuts...
Don't get anything.

10:37.709 --> 10:40.750
I'll just get some mixed nuts.
It's all I've really taken--

10:40.750 --> 10:43.083
Oh! Oh!
( TV smashes )

10:43.083 --> 10:45.375
( car alarm blaring )

10:50.166 --> 10:51.959
Room fee, check.

10:51.959 --> 10:54.208
Lodging tax, check.

10:54.208 --> 10:58.333
Well, somebody had
a bit of fun last night,
didn't they, Jemaine?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.542
What?
$8 can of mixed nuts.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.500
They must have
been pretty good.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.000
Got so much buzz out
of them that you chucked
a television out the window.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.417
Actually, Murray, that was me.
Don't cover for him, Bret.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.250
I know how
rock 'n' roll he thinks
he is-- Mr. Keith Moon.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.208
It wasn't Jemaine,
it was me.
Murray: Really?

11:13.208 --> 11:15.792
Yes.
I see what
you're doing.

11:15.792 --> 11:18.208
You're watching Jemaine
with his rock 'n' roll moves,

11:18.208 --> 11:20.250
buying the leather suits,
getting the mixed nuts,

11:20.250 --> 11:23.125
jumping on the bed.
And you thought, "Oh,
how can I equal this?"

11:23.125 --> 11:26.083
Is that what it is?
No.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.750
Would you like
some mixed nuts?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.625
Have you got
any cashews in there?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.000
No, I picked them out.
Typical.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.750
( classic rock music
playing )

11:41.583 --> 11:44.041
Bret:
One, two, check.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.792
Check.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.125
( silent )

12:03.083 --> 12:06.166
Hi, I'm Murray Hewitt from
Murray Hewitt Productions.

12:06.166 --> 12:08.458
Hi, Murray.
I've got Flight of
the Conchords with me.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.041
We're just on
a warm-up tour.

12:10.041 --> 12:12.291
Really looking forward
to doing a gig here tonight.

12:12.291 --> 12:15.250
These are the guys that
destroyed all that equipment
the other night

12:15.250 --> 12:17.542
in Passaic!
Yeah.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.291
Yeah, um...

12:19.291 --> 12:21.125
I paid it back!
( door slams )

12:21.125 --> 12:23.000
We reimb...

12:26.625 --> 12:30.500
Guys, I just need
a moment alone, all right?

12:32.417 --> 12:34.041
( leather creaking )

12:34.041 --> 12:36.625
Hey, has your suit
snugged up a little bit?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.917
In certain areas, yes.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.000
And in other areas,
also yes.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.500
Hey, I was wondering
if you guys could settle
a bet for me?

12:44.500 --> 12:45.875
What sort of bet?

12:45.875 --> 12:47.458
Are you guys
in a band?

12:47.458 --> 12:49.875
Yes.
Is it that obvious?
( girl laughs )

12:49.875 --> 12:52.458
I knew it, I totally knew it.
They are!

12:52.458 --> 12:54.500
See? 'Cause the--
the second I saw

12:54.500 --> 12:57.166
the cool leather suits,
I just knew it.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.041
They're a dead giveaway,
aren't they? Just...

12:59.041 --> 13:00.667
Totally.

13:00.667 --> 13:03.458
Becky thought you guys
were probably just
a couple of magicians,

13:03.458 --> 13:04.834
and Kathy, Lisa,
Tawny and Tracy

13:04.834 --> 13:06.709
thought you were probably
just a couple of gays.

13:06.709 --> 13:09.166
Looks like Becky
and Kathy were wrong.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.667
And Lisa and Tawny
and Tracy-- what was it?

13:11.667 --> 13:14.291
You guys want to join us
for some drinks or something?

13:14.291 --> 13:16.875
Uh, we just got
two fresh waters, so...

13:16.875 --> 13:17.959
We'd be delighted.

13:17.959 --> 13:20.583
Hey, why are you all
dressed the same?

13:20.583 --> 13:22.458
Are you guys a band?
Are you sexy nurses?

13:22.458 --> 13:27.041
What? No, we're
the North Jersey University
women's water polo team.

13:27.041 --> 13:30.208
All:
N-J-U-W-W-P-T!

13:30.208 --> 13:32.083
Whoo!

13:32.083 --> 13:34.375
All right,
come on, then.

13:36.709 --> 13:39.542
( leather squeaking )

13:44.041 --> 13:46.667
Do you guys have
water polo in New Zealand?

13:46.667 --> 13:48.542
Do we? Pfft.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.291
Do we?
Yeah, it's...
Everyone plays it.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.333
It's our national sport.
Yeah, it's our national sport.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.375
Every single person
plays it, yeah.
Yeah.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.333
Bret's mum plays it.
Really?

13:56.333 --> 13:58.959
It's a beautiful game.
Becky: That's perfect.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.125
That is perfect.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.083
I am totally
gonna save this autograph

14:02.083 --> 14:03.542
for when
you guys are huge.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.542
Then I will be able
to say that I knew...

14:05.542 --> 14:07.917
Bret?
Yeah. Bret.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.250
Brit?
Bret.

14:09.250 --> 14:10.834
Brit.
Bret.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.083
Brit.
Bret.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.291
Bret!
Yeah, yeah.

14:14.291 --> 14:16.458
Sorry. What--
what's your last name?

14:16.458 --> 14:17.750
Bret.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.000
Bret Bret?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.542
No, just joking.
It's McKenzie.

14:21.542 --> 14:23.083
Oh!

14:23.083 --> 14:25.208
He's got a great sense
of humor-- Don't joke, please.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.083
Yeah, sorry about that.
Don't joke, Bret...

14:27.083 --> 14:29.208
Sorry, I shouldn't have...
...It's confusing
when you joke.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.500
That's my name, that's--

14:30.500 --> 14:32.208
I love your accent.
Thank you.

14:32.208 --> 14:35.166
I have the same.
Say, "Throw another shrimp
on the barbie."

14:35.166 --> 14:37.291
Oh, that's-- that's
an Australian saying.
New Zealand--

14:37.291 --> 14:38.458
Throw another shrimp
on the barbie.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.500
( girls laugh )
Crikey! Wha!

14:41.500 --> 14:45.583
What do you guys say
we take this party upstairs?

14:45.583 --> 14:49.291
Ho. I'd say... yes.

14:49.291 --> 14:52.041
Uh well, what room
are you guys in?

14:52.041 --> 14:54.709
Um, 12...
1206.

14:54.709 --> 14:56.667
1206. 12-zero-6.
Write it down, Bret.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.792
1206...
Be-- be tidy about it.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.291
I like your "2."
It's nice.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.417
So what is water polo?

15:04.417 --> 15:07.125
It's like polo
but in the water.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.709
On sea horses?

15:08.709 --> 15:10.542
No,
just swimming.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.000
Oh, okay.
Beautiful
swimming ladies.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.291
Yeah, swimming
in the water,

15:15.291 --> 15:17.625
Beautiful ladies.
Wow.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.709
Like mermaids.

15:19.709 --> 15:23.333
Yes.

It's 4:35.

17:15.375 --> 17:18.500
Mmm. You did tell them
room 1206, right?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.625
Yeah, you were there.
I wrote it down.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.250
Ah. Hmm.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.792
Bret, do you
think maybe...

17:24.792 --> 17:26.500
they're not coming,
maybe?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.792
What?
Well...

17:28.792 --> 17:31.291
we've been waiting
for five hours.

17:31.291 --> 17:34.333
Hmm, maybe.

17:34.333 --> 17:37.041
Do you feel like
a sparkling water?

17:37.041 --> 17:39.750
Yeah, I'd love one.
I wanted one three hours ago,

17:39.750 --> 17:42.166
but you said
Murray wouldn't let us.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.625
Hang on a minute.

17:47.291 --> 17:49.625
( knocks )
Murray?

17:49.625 --> 17:51.291
What?
Are you sleeping?

17:51.291 --> 17:55.000
Oh, I was, Bret.
Trying to, anyway.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.709
Comfortable?
No!

17:56.709 --> 17:58.583
How's your party?
Mmm, it's all right.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.959
It's just Jemaine and me.
The girls didn't show up.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.750
Aw.
Never mind, eh?

18:02.750 --> 18:05.500
Jemaine and I were
wondering if we could
have a sparkling water?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.834
No.
We really need it.

18:06.834 --> 18:07.959
No!
Please?

18:07.959 --> 18:09.333
Not from the minibar.
Please.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.750
No!
Please.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.792
Look, just pour some tap water
and blow some bubbles in it.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.000
Mmm,
it's not the same.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Come on, I want
to come out there.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.041
Mmm, well the girls
still might show up.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.000
Okay.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.333
Good night.
Night night.

18:32.625 --> 18:35.250
Okay, hang on a minute, guys.
I haven't settled the bill yet.

18:35.250 --> 18:36.500
Just a few questions.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.625
We didn't have anything
from the minibar.

18:38.625 --> 18:42.375
No, I can see that, Bret.
"Minibar charge, 0.00."

18:42.375 --> 18:47.208
Right here after
"Drinks charged to the room
from hotel bar, $352."

18:47.208 --> 18:49.291
How much was that water?
( car honking )

18:49.291 --> 18:51.000
The water was free.
Hang on, mates!

18:51.000 --> 18:52.500
Someone wants me
to move my car.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.583
Band meeting!
I'm just--
Waters were
about $175.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.291
I'm doing a...

18:56.291 --> 18:59.000
Here we are, two waters.
Is that your signature?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.500
Mmm?
Right there?

19:00.500 --> 19:02.000
Oh no,
that's my autograph.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.709
Yup, same-- that's what
a signature is.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.041
Okay, and there's
the room number.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.458
Uh...
Oh, is that--

19:06.458 --> 19:08.250
( car honking )
Hang on, mate!

19:08.250 --> 19:09.875
Okay.
Look, do us a favor
and move the car.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.375
Go on, quickly.
Oh, that's...

19:11.375 --> 19:13.208
Go!
Move the car.

19:15.375 --> 19:17.041
This is your doing,
isn't it, Rod Stewart?

19:17.041 --> 19:18.500
You can tell.
It wasn't me,
actually.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.417
The dead giveaway.
Look at all that money.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.792
It was a women's
water polo team.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.834
Okay, right,
that makes sense.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.667
I'll tell them that.
"Yeah, sorry,

19:26.667 --> 19:28.500
it was polo players."

19:28.500 --> 19:30.083
Must happen
all the time, does it?

19:30.083 --> 19:32.041
Well, I doubt if they're
gonna listen to you.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.417
Is this a joke,
Jemaine?
No.

19:33.417 --> 19:36.500
A big joke?
$352 water polo joke?

19:36.500 --> 19:39.792
No.
Well, let me just go
and fix it, shall I?

19:39.792 --> 19:41.041
Give me the keys.

19:41.041 --> 19:43.041
Oh, they're in the car.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.250
Idiot.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.750
Um, did you put
the hand brake on?
Is it--

19:46.750 --> 19:49.583
( splashes )
Oh, fuck.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.417
I just don't understand
what happened.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.834
I put the hand brake on.

19:53.834 --> 19:56.250
Well that's what happened.
The Amer-- on American cars,

19:56.250 --> 19:57.834
the hand brake's
on this side.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.583
Oh, I must have just
adjusted the seat.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.750
Oh, very rock 'n' roll,
Bret.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.333
More rock 'n' roll
than Jemaine.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.333
That's what you were
going for, wasn't it?

20:05.333 --> 20:07.834
Well, well done.
Mission accomplished.

20:07.834 --> 20:11.667
First Jemaine
with the mixed nuts,

20:11.667 --> 20:13.500
then the TV.

20:13.500 --> 20:18.709
And finally, Bret,
you drive my Honda
into the pool!

20:18.709 --> 20:20.458
Personally, I prefer
the mixed nuts caper.

20:20.458 --> 20:22.625
At least that was original.
Jemaine: Thank you.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.417
Murray, I didn't actually
mean to put your car

20:25.417 --> 20:26.583
into the swimming pool.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.458
I didn't-- I didn't mean
to buy those nuts.

20:28.458 --> 20:31.125
Well, I didn't mean
to put all my efforts

20:31.125 --> 20:33.083
into looking after a couple
of leather-clad lunatics

20:33.083 --> 20:36.125
who don't give a damn
about anyone
but themselves.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.792
That's my mistake!

20:37.792 --> 20:40.625
Well, we all-- we've all
made a mistake each,

20:40.625 --> 20:42.875
so it sort of
evens out.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.667
No!
Okay, guys?

20:44.667 --> 20:47.291
Look, the strategic union
of Flight of the Conchords

20:47.291 --> 20:49.792
and Murray Hewitt Productions
is terminated.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.333
What are you
talking about?
What?

20:51.333 --> 20:53.000
You know what
I'm talking about.
I'm quitting!

20:53.000 --> 20:55.583
You can't quit the band.
Bret usually quits
the band.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.083
Well, this is
my turn, okay?

20:57.083 --> 20:58.667
I've had it
with you guys!

20:58.667 --> 21:00.208
I'm so angry,
I feel like swearing.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.500
Oh Murray,
you wouldn't swear at us.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.959
Go fuck yourself, Bret!

21:08.000 --> 21:11.083
Girls:
N-J-U-W-W-P-T!
Whoo!

21:11.083 --> 21:12.500
Whoo!

21:15.583 --> 21:18.000
Do you have
any money for a bus?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.542
No, do you?

21:19.542 --> 21:21.500
No, none.

21:22.959 --> 21:25.709
I guess there's
no choice, really.

21:25.709 --> 21:29.125
So, uh, have you
and Mel been...

21:29.125 --> 21:31.542
following us
through this whole--

21:31.542 --> 21:35.041
during this whole tour--
tour, Doug?

21:35.041 --> 21:36.500
Uh, it seems like it.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.417
Mel's in charge
of the itinerary.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.750
She said she just wanted
to get away on a road trip,

21:41.750 --> 21:43.458
get away from it all.

21:43.458 --> 21:44.792
That him?

21:44.792 --> 21:47.500
Uh, no that's just
some homeless guy.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.583
Oh no, that is him!
Slow down, Doug.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.458
We're very sorry,
Murray.

21:55.458 --> 21:57.125
I'm not talking
to you guys.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.375
Just give this to him.

21:58.375 --> 22:00.291
Bret says just
give this to you.

22:00.291 --> 22:02.333
Oh, what's that?
A bag of stolen clock radios

22:02.333 --> 22:03.709
from the hotels
we stayed at?

22:03.709 --> 22:05.792
No.
Bret: Tell him to look inside.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.917
Bret says,
"Just tell him
to look in it."

22:20.542 --> 22:23.917
Oh, wow.
Whoa.

22:23.917 --> 22:26.959
Huh?
Bret: It's a little big.

22:26.959 --> 22:29.625
But get it wet and it
snugs up, it'll shrink--

22:29.625 --> 22:30.792
shrink to fit.

22:30.792 --> 22:33.083
Yeah, I can't even
get mine off.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.500
You know, I've--
I've done a lot of thinking

22:36.500 --> 22:39.750
that last 40 minutes
when I was walking along
the side of the road

22:39.750 --> 22:41.083
like a bum.

22:41.083 --> 22:45.417
I kind of realized
I'm not a very
good manager.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.959
Ah. So? I mean,
that's not true.

22:47.959 --> 22:50.166
Thanks, Jemaine.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.750
But it is.

22:51.750 --> 22:54.583
There there.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.291
There there there
there there there.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.375
Bret:
Friends again?
Back in the band?

23:03.375 --> 23:05.750
If you'll have me.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.291
We will.
We do.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.750
What about you, Jemaine?
Will you have me?

23:09.750 --> 23:12.166
Yeah. Yeah.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.458
Yup.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.875
What's...
Then you put your--

23:17.875 --> 23:19.041
Potato?
You--

23:19.041 --> 23:21.083
One potato, two--
No, just leave it.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.792
Come on, we've got a gig.
We've got a gig to get to.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.834
Let's go!

23:25.834 --> 23:28.583
Did you miss me?

23:29.458 --> 23:31.208
Little bit.
Little bit, eh?

23:31.208 --> 23:32.417
Yeah.

23:32.417 --> 23:33.625
Jemaine?
What?

23:33.625 --> 23:35.625
Miss me?
Oh...

23:39.166 --> 23:41.458
This isn't Central Park.

23:41.458 --> 23:42.834
Yes it is.
It's a central park.

23:42.834 --> 23:44.834
It's not
Central Park, though.

23:44.834 --> 23:46.291
But it is
a  central park.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.000
But you said
Central Park,
New York.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.166
I said a central park
in Newark...

23:50.166 --> 23:52.208
New Jersey.
You did?

23:52.208 --> 23:56.709
No, you didn't.
You didn't.
Yes, I said,
"A central park in Newark.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.500
So you were
tricking us.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.208
No. Well, look.
If I'd have said it was
a central park in Newark,

24:01.208 --> 24:04.041
you wouldn't
have done the gig.
Yes, we would have.

24:04.041 --> 24:05.959
Well, what are you
worried about, then?

24:05.959 --> 24:07.834
( cell phone ringing )

24:10.083 --> 24:13.500
Hello, Shelly?
Oh look, I can't
actually talk right now.

24:13.500 --> 24:18.000
Why? Because I'm in
the middle of doing something.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.834
Managing a band, actually,

24:19.834 --> 24:22.834
a little band called
Flight of the Conchords.

24:22.834 --> 24:24.208
Yeah, yeah.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.208
'Cause that's what
I do, all right?

24:26.208 --> 24:28.583
Got it?
Good.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.834
( cell phone ringing )

24:33.208 --> 24:36.041
Sorry, Shel,
I didn't mean to--

24:36.041 --> 24:37.875
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes.

24:37.875 --> 24:41.542
Yes. Listen, um,
the reason I haven't
been at work all week

24:41.542 --> 24:43.792
is, uh-- well,
it's funny really.

24:43.792 --> 24:46.542
I-- I tripped over,
and both of my leg...

24:46.542 --> 24:50.166
Uh, muscles have--
well, they contracted...
( feedback whines)

24:50.166 --> 24:52.208
...and I didn't know
what-- No.

24:52.208 --> 24:55.041
No, I don't manage
a band.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.291
It has nothing to do
with a band.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.875
Honestly,
it's my legs.

24:57.875 --> 25:01.917
I think I've broken
a piece of them.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.000
Yes.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.417
No, there's nothing going on
in the background.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.959
Okay.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.834
Yes. I'll be in
first thing.

25:12.834 --> 25:15.083
( folk music playing )
