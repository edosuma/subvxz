10:59.826 --> 11:02.037
The poor little guy's just sitting there
eating his Snack Pack.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.123
Bill Cosby just runs in out of nowhere
and just starts wailing on him.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.375
Didn't that guy die?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.752
No, no, these are home movies
from when I was a puppy.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.255
-He died.
-Okay, look, just watch.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.689
ALL: Aw!

11:30.691 --> 11:35.070
-Look at him sleep.
-I wonder what he's dreaming about.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.613
Shut up, Meg.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.365
(FARTS)

11:38.448 --> 11:40.367
-Did you hear that?
-He farted.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.286
Just like in the song.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.705
(LOUD FART)

11:45.330 --> 11:49.042
What the hell is the matter with you?
Outside! Outside now!

11:51.587 --> 11:53.922
Well, I hate to say I told you so, but...

11:54.006 --> 11:56.133
Wait a minute.
I love saying I told you so!

11:56.717 --> 12:00.721
Hey, Stewie Griffin, meet Stewie Griffin.
Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.

12:00.804 --> 12:04.224
-Great outfit. Go on. No, it is.
-So what if there's a new dog?

12:04.308 --> 12:06.310
Lots of families have two dogs.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.937
Hey, Brian, I thought maybe
we could spend the afternoon together.

12:09.021 --> 12:12.399
-Really? That'd be great!
-Awesome, 'cause I got this new gun...

12:12.482 --> 12:13.483
Here we go.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.861
...and I thought we could go
deep in the woods,

12:15.944 --> 12:18.405
-where no one would ever think to look...
-Oh, boy.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.157
-...and just shoot it.
-Awkward.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.576
You know, like so far in
that no one can hear gunfire...

12:22.659 --> 12:25.204
-A little on the nose.
-...or screaming.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.206
I don't think so, Peter.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.166
Jeez, it's like he thinks
I'm gonna shoot him.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.461
He's acting all crazy like Quagmire
when he drunk-dials me.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.046
(PHONE RINGING)

12:35.422 --> 12:36.423
Hello?

12:36.507 --> 12:39.343
QUAGMIRE: (SLURRING) Hey,
what are you... What are you doing?

12:39.426 --> 12:42.471
-Quagmire, I'm sleeping.
-Yeah, I was just out with Joe.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.390
-What are you doing?
-I just told you.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.519
That's right.
I just... I just asked that. I forgot.

12:48.602 --> 12:53.023
Hey, hey, this song made me think of you,
so, wait, listen to this song.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.400
(STATIC BUZZING)

12:57.236 --> 12:59.863
-Isn't that awesome?
-JOE: You said you weren't gonna call him.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.992
QUAGMIRE: It's not him, you big bully.
Joe told me not to call you.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.912
So what... So what are you doing?

13:06.995 --> 13:07.996
(SIGHS)

13:13.377 --> 13:15.546
Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

13:15.629 --> 13:20.008
-I've decided I'm leaving.
-What? Leaving? Brian, why?

13:20.092 --> 13:23.470
Well, you know, I feel like
I've sort of run my course here,

13:23.554 --> 13:26.640
and, you know, besides,
there's a whole big world out there,

13:26.723 --> 13:27.850
and it's time I saw it.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.894
But, Brian, you live here.
This is your home.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.313
I know, but I've thought about this
long and hard, and...

13:33.397 --> 13:37.609
(LAUGHS) "Long and hard." I'm sorry.
Brian, please, please continue.

13:37.693 --> 13:41.446
-This is just something I have to do.
-Well, where will you go?

13:41.530 --> 13:44.449
Well, I haven't decided that yet,
but I promise I'll be in touch.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.826
(LAUGHS)

13:45.909 --> 13:47.119
Wait. How is that one dirty?

13:47.202 --> 13:49.663
It's... I was
remembering "long and hard."

13:49.746 --> 13:54.793
Well, if your mind is made up about this,
Brian, then I wish you the best of luck.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.754
I hope this move won't be a boner for you.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.508
-Peter?
-What?

14:01.592 --> 14:05.012
I was just saying to Brian,
"I hope this move won't be a boner."

14:05.095 --> 14:07.347
I would agree.
I hope he finds what he's looking for.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.515
Okay.

14:08.599 --> 14:11.226
Well, we're gonna miss you, Brian.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.610
NEW BRIAN: Hey, everybody,
let's watch this tape.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.945
Okay, now there's the midget
just sitting there.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.697
Now watch the left side of the screen.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.075
BILL COSBY: I'm in a bad mood,
and I'm gonna take it out on you!

14:27.159 --> 14:29.745
LOIS: Oh, my God!
Well, he's obviously drunk.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.039
MAN: You're hurting me!

14:32.122 --> 14:34.625
BILL COSBY: About which
I do not care very much.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.926
-Pancake?
-Just a small one, thanks.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.846
My God,
these are the best pancakes I've ever had!

14:47.930 --> 14:50.682
I bet Brian would love these pancakes.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.268
-I wonder where he is.
-He's next door with Cleveland.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.394
I saw him on my morning paper route.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.315
You know,
I appreciate you letting me stay with you,

14:58.398 --> 15:01.693
but I'm perfectly capable
of going to the bathroom by myself.

15:01.777 --> 15:04.154
Sorry, but there's a leash law
in this neighborhood,

15:04.238 --> 15:06.365
and you never know who's watching.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.327
(EVIL LAUGH)

15:10.410 --> 15:13.830
I'm watching you make stool.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.838
Hey, New Brian. I see you're having pie.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.091
You know,
pie isn't really pie without Cool Whip.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.302
Everything's better with Cool Whip.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.138
-Did you hear what I said?
-Yeah. What about it?

15:30.222 --> 15:32.307
It doesn't bother you
the way I pronounce it?

15:32.391 --> 15:34.351
-Cool Whip?
-No. Why would it?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.812
Cool Whip.
I'm putting emphasis on the "H."

15:36.895 --> 15:39.815
-Sounds right to me.
-Nothing ever bothers you, does it?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.192
No, not really. I like everything.

15:42.276 --> 15:45.070
God, he's a bigger buzzkill
than Buzz Killington.

15:45.237 --> 15:51.076
Stewie, do you know why
W.S. Gilbert was frequently drunk

15:51.159 --> 15:54.997
-on his transatlantic crossings?
-No.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.084
Because he was quartered
on the port side.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.669
(CHUCKLES)

16:01.628 --> 16:03.589
Now that I've got you,

16:03.672 --> 16:08.177
let's both revisit the birth
of The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.

16:08.552 --> 16:09.553
(SIGHS)

16:14.349 --> 16:18.645
(SINGING) Everybody hurts

16:19.104 --> 16:20.731
Two, three...

16:20.814 --> 16:23.817
Sometimes

16:23.901 --> 16:25.152
(ALL LAUGHING)

16:25.235 --> 16:27.237
Okay, New Brian, you're next!

16:27.446 --> 16:31.617
(LAUGHS) Oh, no. Oh, boy.
All right, well, I can't do this alone.

16:31.700 --> 16:36.788
-Lois, I'm gonna need your help here.
-Oh, my God. Okay.

16:36.872 --> 16:40.000
Rita Coolidge's less-talented sister here.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.376
(ALL LAUGH)

16:41.502 --> 16:43.337
In what way is that a joke?

16:44.004 --> 16:47.049
-Okay, you start.
-All right. I don't know...

16:47.132 --> 16:48.217
Am I blue or am I red? This is crazy.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.345
-You're blue. You're blue.
-Okay, I'll do it, then.

16:51.470 --> 16:55.432
(SINGING) Summer lovin' had me a blast

16:55.557 --> 16:59.061
Summer lovin' happened so fast

16:59.186 --> 17:05.984
-I met a girl, that's you, crazy for me
-I met a boy, he's as cute as can be

17:07.236 --> 17:10.030
-Summer days driftin' away
-Summer days driftin' away

17:10.113 --> 17:12.699
-To uh-oh those summer nights
-To uh-oh those summer nights

17:12.783 --> 17:14.910
Oh, well-a, well-a, well-a, uh

17:14.993 --> 17:16.912
Tell me more, tell me more

17:19.039 --> 17:21.625
Thanks for letting me stay here, Glenn.
I hope I'm not in the way.

17:21.708 --> 17:26.004
No, no, it should be fine.
But, listen, Brian,

17:26.755 --> 17:29.424
I'm gonna be bringing
a Puerto Rican girl over here later.

17:29.508 --> 17:34.721
And she's super hot and real nice,
but when she was five years old,

17:34.805 --> 17:37.516
her dad ran over
one of her legs with his van,

17:37.808 --> 17:42.729
and it's still kind of messed up in a
pretty obvious, instantly visible way.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.773
Please don't say anything.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.860
And try to make eye contact with her
when she wobbles in,

17:47.943 --> 17:49.736
because I want this to work.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.363
Yeah, sure. No problem.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.657
I'm serious, Brian.
That leg is a train wreck.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.742
I mean, she herself is so pretty,

17:55.826 --> 17:59.079
but that thing
just looks like a string of sausages

17:59.162 --> 18:01.123
-with one empty casing in it.
-I get it.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.624
I mean, it's quite a sight, you know?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.585
I mean, when she's not looking,
you should take a look at it,

18:04.668 --> 18:09.089
-but, good God, be discreet.
-Yeah, I'll check that out.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.758
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

18:12.926 --> 18:15.929
-Stewie, what are you doing here?
-Brian, you gotta come back.

18:16.013 --> 18:19.808
-Why?
-Because New Brian is such a tool.

18:19.892 --> 18:23.228
I mean, he's so damn sweet
and saccharine and perfect,

18:23.312 --> 18:25.689
and he's turning the family
into a bunch of douches.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.275
Big deal.
You always told me I was a douche.

18:28.358 --> 18:32.362
Yeah, but you were my douche, Brian.
My douche.

18:33.030 --> 18:37.743
-Come back and be my douche again.
-Hi, I'm looking for Glenn?

18:37.826 --> 18:39.828
Oh! What happened to your leg?

18:39.912 --> 18:41.496
(CRYING)

18:42.206 --> 18:45.167
-Damn it, Brian!
-Come back home, Brian.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.669
I tell you what. When this is all over,
I'll make you some pie

18:47.753 --> 18:49.796
-with a nice dollop of Cool Whip.
-There it is again.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.924
Why are you putting
so much emphasis on the "H"?

18:52.007 --> 18:53.008
(SIGHS)

18:53.091 --> 18:55.844
-That's exactly why I miss you, Brian.
-Forget it.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.764
I'm not going back
as long as that new dog is there.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.434
As long as he's a part of that family,
there's no place for me.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.854
Well, I can't say I blame you.
I hate him as much as you do, Brian.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.608
He's a bad fit,
like a crocodile at an alligator rally.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.653
Yeah! Lurking in the water
with our eyes poking out!

19:12.736 --> 19:13.862
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

19:13.946 --> 19:16.907
Sneaking up on a crane or an egret
and snapping our jaws on it!

19:16.990 --> 19:18.242
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

19:18.325 --> 19:21.954
And sometimes walking out
onto a dry plain or dusty field

19:22.037 --> 19:24.873
because it's nice to get out
of the swamp now and then!

19:24.957 --> 19:26.124
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.254
-What?
-Dry plain? Dusty field?

19:31.004 --> 19:33.841
-Nice to get out of the swamp?
-What a croc!

19:34.508 --> 19:36.635
And that's where we get the term.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.519
Hey, New Brian. Bad news.
You gotta leave.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.063
Huh? What are you talking about?
This is my home.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.648
Nobody likes you here, man.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.109
Well, I disagree.
I think everybody likes me.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.235
No, we don't.

19:53.318 --> 19:56.029
We don't like your cooking,
your stupid karaoke nights,

19:56.113 --> 19:58.156
and we especially don't like
the way you hump that chair

19:58.240 --> 20:01.577
-in the den.
-Well, Rupert seems to like my humping.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.162
-What did you say?
-Rupert.

20:04.246 --> 20:08.125
Humped him for two hours yesterday.
He just laid there and took it.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.294
-Did he?
-Yeah.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.296
And now every time
you're sleeping with him,

20:12.379 --> 20:14.298
he's gonna be thinking of me.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.563
"And that is why I killed myself,
chopped myself up

20:29.646 --> 20:33.192
"and put myself in the garbage."
Wow, he must've had some demons.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.736
My God, suicide.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.113
How could we have misjudged him
so severely?

20:38.197 --> 20:40.490
Oftentimes,
it's the ones who seem the happiest.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.493
Well, the upside is,
at least we have our old Brian back.

20:43.577 --> 20:47.164
From now on, buddy,
you're the only animal I care about.

20:47.372 --> 20:50.626
Hey, everybody, I'm Bernie the hamster.

20:50.709 --> 20:54.087
-Would you like to be my friend?
-Oh, my God!

20:55.172 --> 20:59.218
-It's okay, Peter.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's a hamster!

21:00.969 --> 21:02.513
(WATER RUNNING)

21:02.596 --> 21:05.682
We'll talk about it
when you want to talk about it.

21:05.766 --> 21:10.646
I don't blame you. I don't blame you.
