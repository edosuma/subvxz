(CAR DOOR OPENS)

03:12.600 --> 03:14.238
Mrs. Kennedy?

03:15.600 --> 03:17.591
They told me to come up.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.553
And I'm so sorry
for your loss.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.628
Have you read
what they've been writing?

03:25.120 --> 03:27.634
Krock and Merriman
and all the rest?

03:29.120 --> 03:30.758
Yes, I have.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.629
Merriman is such
a bitter man.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.558
It's been just one week.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.632
Already they're treating him
like some dusty old artifact,

03:39.760 --> 03:41.113
to be shelved away.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.556
That's no way
to be remembered.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.154
And how would you like him remembered,
Mrs. Kennedy?

03:47.280 --> 03:48.315
(STAMMERS) I...

03:48.440 --> 03:53.116
You understand that I will be
editing this conversation?

03:53.200 --> 03:56.954
Just in case I don't say
exactly what I mean.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.429
With all due respect,

03:58.520 --> 04:00.829
that seems very unlikely,
Mrs. Kennedy.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.558
(CHUCKLES) Right.
Okay. Uh...

04:09.960 --> 04:14.829
So, this will be your own
version of what happened?

04:15.520 --> 04:16.952
Exactly.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.313
Come in.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.676
I thought it was
another backfire.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.909
I very nearly didn't go.
What if I'd been here

04:32.040 --> 04:34.349
or out riding
in Virginia somewhere?

04:35.560 --> 04:37.551
Thank God
I was with him.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.517
Why, "Thank God"?

04:41.520 --> 04:43.909
Do you know what
I think of history?

04:45.560 --> 04:47.232
Of history?

04:47.360 --> 04:50.432
I've read a great deal.
More than people realize.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.073
The more I read,
the more I wonder...

04:52.200 --> 04:53.474
When something
is written down,

04:53.560 --> 04:55.516
does that make it true?

04:55.880 --> 04:56.995
It's all that
we have.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.160
Had.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.798
We have television now.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.394
At least people can see
for their own eyes.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.600
That tour of
the White House

05:04.680 --> 05:06.557
that you did a couple
of years ago for CBS,

05:06.680 --> 05:09.353
I always assumed
that you did that for

05:11.440 --> 05:13.635
a purpose? No?
After the fashion magazines?

05:13.720 --> 05:14.869
You even won an Emmy.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.312
I didn't do that
program for me.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.914
I did it for
the American people.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.439
That program was
my first glimpse

05:21.560 --> 05:22.560
into the White House

05:22.600 --> 05:25.034
and, for whatever it's worth,
I thought you were excellent.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.394
Very poised.
Oh, thank you.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.239
You could have had a career
as a broadcaster, I'm sure.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.515
What?

05:33.400 --> 05:34.549
I'm sorry?

05:34.640 --> 05:35.959
What did you say?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.874
I said you could have
a career... (CHUCKLES)

05:38.960 --> 05:40.712
Could have had a career
as a broadcaster.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.756
Are you giving me
professional advice?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.272
I'm

05:47.240 --> 05:48.434
not.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.472
But I am sure that the whole
country would like to know

05:53.600 --> 05:54.760
what you're going to do next.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.998
I can assure you,
not television.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.629
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Welcome to the White House.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.516
Welcome to the White House.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.909
We're so proud
to call it home.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.398
Why don't you try,
"The People's House"?

06:11.480 --> 06:13.391
Make it more personal.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.870
Welcome to
The People's House.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.315
We're so proud
to call it home.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.629
Better?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.836
When will Jack join us?

06:23.960 --> 06:25.996
They want to
hear from you.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.712
They think I'm a fool.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.950
One year in office,
wasting their money.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.469
That's why you need to show
them what you've done.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.316
The President will join
you in the Monroe Room

06:35.440 --> 06:36.793
at the end
of the tour.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.958
You'll be great.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.517
Stay close.
Of course.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.310
You look beautiful. Go.
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:47.440 --> 06:49.158
JACKIE: Hello.
Excuse me.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.835
(MUSIC PLAYING)

06:57.160 --> 06:58.496
COLLINGWOOD:
This is the White House

06:58.520 --> 07:00.670
as seen from its South Lawn.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.552
For the next hour,
Mrs. John F. Kennedy

07:02.800 --> 07:05.030
invites you to visit
the President's House

07:05.160 --> 07:06.752
and see some
of the restorations

07:06.840 --> 07:08.478
she's made in its interior.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.078
Mrs. John F. Kennedy,

07:11.200 --> 07:15.318
third-youngest of the 29 wives
to live in the White House.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.231
Mrs. Kennedy,
I want to thank you

07:23.360 --> 07:25.954
for letting us visit
your official home.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.393
This is obviously
the room

07:27.520 --> 07:29.829
from which much of your
work on it is directed.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.071
Yes, it's attic and cellar
all in one.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.428
Since our work started,

07:34.520 --> 07:37.318
we receive hundreds
of letters every day.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.274
This is where we evaluate
all the finds,

07:40.360 --> 07:41.600
and see if we want
to keep them,

07:41.720 --> 07:43.711
if they'll fit
into our budget.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.353
Mrs. Kennedy,
every First Lady

07:47.440 --> 07:50.238
and every administration since
President Madison's time,

07:50.360 --> 07:51.713
has made changes,

07:51.840 --> 07:53.717
greater or smaller,
in the White House.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.035
Before we look at any
of the changes you've made...

07:57.080 --> 07:59.355
Now, what's
your basic plan?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.117
Well, I really
don't have one.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.518
Because I think this house
will always grow, and should.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.717
It just seemed to me
such a shame

08:09.880 --> 08:11.313
when we came here to find

08:11.400 --> 08:14.472
hardly anything of the past
in the house.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.233
Hardly anything before 1902.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.794
COLLINGWOOD: Now suppose
that you and your committee

08:19.920 --> 08:21.512
were to acquire
some of the things

08:21.600 --> 08:23.352
that are in this room,

08:24.280 --> 08:26.589
what happens when
the next President's wife

08:26.720 --> 08:28.438
comes into
the White House?

08:30.040 --> 08:32.918
(INHALES DEEPLY) Well,
if they don't want it...

08:33.039 --> 08:34.313
In the past, you see,

08:34.440 --> 08:36.715
they could sell it
or throw it out.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.239
And the talk of the taxpayer
money being wasted?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.231
JACKIE: Oh, I raised
every dime privately

08:44.320 --> 08:46.356
that we spent
on that restoration.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.158
I... I loved that house,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.430
and I wanted to share it
with the American people.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.632
To impart a sense
of America's greatness.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.631
(STAMMERS)
Objects and artifacts

08:57.760 --> 09:00.069
last far longer than people,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.994
and they represent
important ideas in history,

09:04.120 --> 09:06.793
identity, beauty.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.390
But I'm sure that, uh,
the readers would like to know

09:10.480 --> 09:14.109
what it's like to be
a member of your family?

09:15.280 --> 09:19.990
Imagine a little boy
surrounded by all of this.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.840
Having his older brother
die in battle,

09:22.920 --> 09:24.353
and then going off
to that same war

09:24.480 --> 09:26.038
and coming home a hero.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.435
People see
that little boy,

09:30.320 --> 09:33.039
born to wealth
and privilege,

09:33.160 --> 09:36.994
willing to sacrifice
everything for his ideals

09:37.120 --> 09:39.031
in service
to his nation.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.230
Royalty. You make him
sound like royalty.

09:41.320 --> 09:45.313
Well, for royalty
you need tradition.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.836
And for tradition,
you need time.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.116
Well, I guess it has
to start somewhere, right?

09:54.200 --> 09:57.510
There has to be a day one.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.200
COLLINGWOOD:
This is the East Room,

10:00.320 --> 10:02.072
pretty much as Americans

10:02.200 --> 10:04.350
have known it now
for 60 years.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.799
Obviously you haven't
felt that

10:05.880 --> 10:08.394
you had to make any
great changes in here.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.035
No, I think it's lovely.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.116
I hate to make
changes really,

10:13.200 --> 10:15.589
so when you find
a room like this,

10:15.680 --> 10:17.193
it's wonderful. This...

10:17.320 --> 10:19.311
COLLINGWOOD:
This piano brings to mind

10:19.400 --> 10:21.550
that, uh, this is the part
of the White House

10:21.720 --> 10:24.359
where you have
the musical affairs.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.556
That's right. This piano was
designed by Franklin Roosevelt

10:29.680 --> 10:31.033
with the eagle support.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.794
And this is
the end of the room

10:34.880 --> 10:36.916
where Pablo Casals
played for us,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.837
where we had
a portable stage built,

10:38.920 --> 10:40.717
when we had
the Shakespeare players.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.513
COLLINGWOOD: Mrs. Kennedy,
this administration

10:44.600 --> 10:46.431
has shown
a particular affinity

10:46.560 --> 10:49.870
for artists, musicians,
writers, poets...

10:50.040 --> 10:51.917
Is this because
you and your husband

10:52.040 --> 10:53.359
just feel that way,

10:53.440 --> 10:55.590
or do you think
that there's a relationship

10:55.720 --> 10:57.870
between the government
and the arts?

10:59.080 --> 11:01.230
That's so complicated.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.157
I... I don't know.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.719
I just think that everything

11:04.800 --> 11:06.631
in the White House
should be the best.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.715
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)

11:27.280 --> 11:30.238
And if it's
an American company

11:30.320 --> 11:32.595
that you can help,
I like to do that.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.951
If it's not...
Just as long as it's the best.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.316
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

12:02.760 --> 12:04.079
(MUSIC ENDS)

12:06.680 --> 12:08.477
Is your faith helping you?

12:09.320 --> 12:12.039
I'd prefer to discuss
my faith with a priest.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.476
You're not a man
of the cloth, are you?

12:15.600 --> 12:17.909
No. No, I'm not.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.176
I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.270
That's what reporters do.
Oh, the truth.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.476
Well, I've grown accustomed
to a great divide

12:23.600 --> 12:26.512
between what people believe
and what I know to be real.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.676
Fine. I will settle for
a story that's believable.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.518
That's more like it.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.554
You know, I used to be
a reporter myself once.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.316
I know what
you're looking for.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.789
I'm sorry?

12:42.160 --> 12:44.628
A moment-by-moment account.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.554
That's what you came
here for, isn't it?

12:47.680 --> 12:50.513
You want me to describe
the sound the bullet made

12:50.640 --> 12:54.872
when it collided
with my husband's skull.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.392
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

13:04.320 --> 13:05.673
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

13:05.840 --> 13:07.831
I'm very happy

13:08.040 --> 13:12.033
to be in the great State of Texas,

13:12.680 --> 13:15.638
to be with you

13:15.840 --> 13:17.558
and experience

13:20.040 --> 13:22.793
the noble Spanish tradition

13:23.000 --> 13:26.037
that has achieved so much in Dallas.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.032
This tradition

13:28.240 --> 13:30.708
started 100 years

13:30.960 --> 13:35.238
before the colonization
of Massachusetts,

13:35.680 --> 13:37.910
my husband's State.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.712
It is all a tradition

13:42.000 --> 13:46.278
that remains alive and strong.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.395
Is that the sou nd of bi rds?

13:56.560 --> 13:59.870
PRESIDENT KENNEDY:
Uh, not exactly birds.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.557
Must be the ocean.
Hmm.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.758
You ready?
Of course.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.871
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
I love crowds.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.916
(CROWD CHEERING)

14:17.760 --> 14:19.557
You remember Governor
and Mrs. Connally.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.154
Welcome to Dallas,
darling. (LAUGHS)

14:23.560 --> 14:24.834
Thank you so much
for coming.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.274
Very nice to meet you.

My! What a welcome!

14:34.240 --> 14:36.310
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

14:58.320 --> 15:01.118
JACKIE: There'd been the biggest
motorcade from the airport.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.471
Hot, wild,
like Mexico or Vienna.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.638
The sun was strong
in our faces,

15:07.800 --> 15:10.155
but I couldn't wear
my sunglasses.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.439
Jack has his hand out,

15:12.520 --> 15:16.638
and I see a piece
of his skull come off.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.034
And it was flesh-colored,
it wasn't white.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.918
And he slumps in my lap.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.958
(INHALES SHARPLY) His blood
and his brains are in my lap.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.718

15:35.520 --> 15:37.078

32:06.840 --> 32:09.752
Lincoln's mount,
Old Bob,

32:09.840 --> 32:13.196
was draped in a black blanket
with white trim and tassels.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.672
Hooded,
he was led rider-less,

32:17.800 --> 32:19.916
the head of
a miles-long procession

32:20.040 --> 32:21.758
by the Reverend Henry Brown.

32:22.760 --> 32:26.036
I can feel Jack
getting angry with this.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.676
"There you go,
spending all that money

32:30.800 --> 32:32.870
"on those silly
knick-knacks."

32:35.040 --> 32:37.270
The man would spend
whatever it took for votes,

32:37.360 --> 32:39.794
but balked at buying
a beautiful painting.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.313
Huh.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.555
We don't have to worry
about that anymore.

32:50.640 --> 32:51.993
We must get
this right, Bill.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.638
We must get this right.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.397
It has to be beautiful.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.473
Did you tell them we'll need
a horse-drawn carriage?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.471
We have to
march with Jack.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.073
Everyone.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.835
A big, beautiful procession
that people will remember.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.912
Mrs. Kennedy,
you don't have to do this.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.479
Do what?

33:15.560 --> 33:16.754
In fact, I don't think

33:16.840 --> 33:19.149
they'll let you parade
through the streets.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.591
The world's gone mad.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.510
You should take the
children and disappear.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.353
Build a fortress in Boston
and never look back.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.159
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

33:30.240 --> 33:31.912
NANCY: Mrs. Kennedy?

33:33.600 --> 33:35.511
(STAMMERS)
Are the children awake?

33:35.600 --> 33:37.716
NANCY: They're playing
in Caroline's room.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.192
How do I do this?

33:44.280 --> 33:45.679
Oh, dear.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.429
It doesn't matter
what you say.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.512
Just hug them and tell
them it will be okay.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.192
CAROLINE: Mommy,
why are you dressed so funny?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.713
(BOTH WHISPERING)

34:09.800 --> 34:12.473
Because something
very sad has happened.

34:13.639 --> 34:16.916
And this is how we dress
when something sad happens.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.591
Mommy, where's Daddy?

34:21.040 --> 34:22.598
Daddy's not coming home.

34:23.159 --> 34:24.478
Why not?

34:27.120 --> 34:29.634
Daddy had to go see
your baby brother Patrick.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.308
In heaven.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.913
CAROLINE: Why?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.638
Because I'm here with you.

34:35.600 --> 34:39.114
We don't want Patrick
to get lonely, do we?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.752
But what about us?

34:46.679 --> 34:50.672
Caroline, I need you
to be a big girl.

34:52.239 --> 34:55.630
You can be brave, right?
You can be a soldier?

34:58.920 --> 35:01.275
A very bad man hurt Daddy.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.470
Daddy would come home
if he could.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.679
But he can't.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.511
He has to go to heaven.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.511
Can I say goodbye?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.195
Yes, of course you can,
my love.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.116
FATHER KUHN:
Let your ears be attentive

35:23.200 --> 35:25.111
to my cry for mercy.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.789
If you, O Lord,
kept a record of sins,

35:29.880 --> 35:32.519
O Lord, who could stand?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.552
But with you
there is forgiveness,

35:36.640 --> 35:39.108
therefore you are feared.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.711
I wait for the Lord,
my soul waits,

35:44.800 --> 35:47.394
and in his word
I put my hope.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.710
My soul waits for the Lord

35:50.840 --> 35:53.673
more than watchmen wait
for the morning.

35:55.080 --> 35:59.756
O Israel,
put your hope in the Lord,

35:59.840 --> 36:03.879
for with the Lord
is unfailing love.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.671
BOBBY: That was
a beautiful mass.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.192
Excuse me, Mother. Jackie.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.194
Have you started on
the guest list for the burial?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.599
The what?

36:39.720 --> 36:41.870
You'll need to
pare it down, dear.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.635
We can't possibly accommodate
all these people at Brookline.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.880
VALENTI: (SOFTLY) Mr. Kennedy,
we need to discuss the funeral, sir.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.120
We all want
to follow her lead,

36:51.240 --> 36:53.117
but we still don't know
much about this Oswald.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.111
There may be
co-conspirators.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.318
I'll talk to her,
but she makes the call.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.915
There's also the matter
of the Oval.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.310
What do you want me
to do first?

37:06.400 --> 37:08.470
Hmm? Plan the funeral
or pack the furniture?

37:08.600 --> 37:09.794
I know this is
all delicate.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.233
That's why
I'm approaching you.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.231
But a procession is insane.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.154
Brookline?

37:15.280 --> 37:16.998
The family plot.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.232
Well, I assume Jack will be
buried with the rest of us.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.120
A crowd full of people,
given what's happened,

37:24.160 --> 37:26.310
I just can't have
my President walking.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.476
Your President?
My President.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.068
(SIGHS)

37:30.680 --> 37:32.671
Well, regardless
of what happens,

37:32.760 --> 37:34.671
my brother is going
to be carried in a box.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.318
And I am
sorry, sir.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.592
Fuck off, Jack.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.273
JANET: Averell Harriman owns

37:49.360 --> 37:52.033
at least four properties
in Georgetown.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.669
I'm sure he could
loan out one of them.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.677
NANCY: I'll have Sarge
look into it.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.949
I'm sure we have time.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.349
They can't expect us to
move immediately, can they?

38:00.440 --> 38:03.671
JANET: Of course not.
Don't be silly.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.035
Lincoln's widow
died destitute.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.270
She moved back to Illinois,

38:09.360 --> 38:11.794
had to sell
all her furniture.

38:11.880 --> 38:15.270
And the Van Burens
and the Tylers, too.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.877
She auctioned it off,
piece by piece,

38:19.000 --> 38:20.877
just to keep a roof
over her head.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.877
NANCY: But that
won't happen to you.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.871
And the collectors
we bought it from...

38:25.000 --> 38:26.115
Remember? Bill and I,

38:26.240 --> 38:28.800
we had to haggle
over every sofa, every chair.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.471
If I sell some of it
back now,

38:33.560 --> 38:36.472
maybe I can put John
and Caroline through school.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.917
COLLINGWOOD: This staircase
goes up to the second floor,

38:40.040 --> 38:42.076
which I know are reserved

38:42.200 --> 38:44.475
for the private living of
the President and his family.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.915
I don't think
any television cameras

38:47.000 --> 38:49.798
or motion picture cameras
have ever gone up there,

38:49.880 --> 38:52.075
'cause that's where you live.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.593
That's right.

38:54.920 --> 38:58.071
Here is what the White House
did to President Lincoln.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.751
Here is how he changed.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.671
1861.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.513
The strong man
with the arched eyebrow.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.752
1865.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.755
One week before
his assassination.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.909
Mrs. Kennedy, do you spend
a great deal of time

39:17.040 --> 39:18.075
in the Lincoln Room?

39:18.360 --> 39:20.828
JACKIE: It was where we lived
when we first came here,

39:20.960 --> 39:22.576
when our rooms
at the other end of the hall

39:22.600 --> 39:23.669
were being painted.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.896
COLLINGWOOD:
It's a nice room.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.195
Was this a bedroom
during Lincoln's time?

39:27.280 --> 39:30.033
JACKIE: No, it was,
uh, Lincoln's Cabinet Room.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.256
COLLINGWOOD:
Are all the pieces

39:31.280 --> 39:32.554
from Lincoln's time?

39:34.760 --> 39:36.557
JACKIE: Uh, yes, they are.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.030
The most famous one,
of course, is the Lincoln bed.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.190
It was bought by Mrs. Lincoln,

39:42.280 --> 39:44.032
along with
the dressing bureaus

39:44.120 --> 39:46.111
and chair, and this table.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.792
Um, she bought a lot
of furniture for this house,

39:49.920 --> 39:51.876
which made her husband
rather cross

39:51.960 --> 39:54.474
because he thought
she spent too much money.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.553
And on the table
is the Gettysburg Address.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.917
This is probably the greatest
treasure in this room.

40:09.760 --> 40:12.672
And this sofa
and these two chairs,

40:12.800 --> 40:15.075
they were sold
in that Lincoln sale

40:15.160 --> 40:16.752
I was telling you about,

40:16.840 --> 40:18.353
that Mrs. Lincoln sold.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.078
And they went to England,

40:20.160 --> 40:21.832
and then through
the descendants

40:21.920 --> 40:24.309
of the man
who brought them there.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.896

Here he comes, here he comes.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.069
Bobby?

40:28.640 --> 40:30.835
Here he comes out
and down the hall again.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.354
I really don't know
what this situation is about.

40:36.480 --> 40:39.631
Nobody has told me anything,
except that I'm accused of...

40:39.920 --> 40:42.354
I don't mean
to upset your mother,

40:42.440 --> 40:45.432
but Brookline is no place
to bury a President.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.474
(BOBBY SIGHS)

40:53.360 --> 40:54.952
REPORTER: Did you
kill the President?

40:55.360 --> 40:57.112
OSWALD: No, I've not
been charged with that.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.350
In fact, nobody has
said that to me yet.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.718
First thing I heard
about it was when

41:01.840 --> 41:04.195
the newspaper reporters
in the hall...

Mrs. Kennedy.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.389
JACKIE: Thank you.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.311
METZLER: The third option
is just over there,

41:44.400 --> 41:45.594
at the base of that hill.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.233
That's too low.

41:47.320 --> 41:48.594
What do you think, Ken?

41:48.720 --> 41:49.835
I did like Dewey Circle,

41:49.920 --> 41:51.536
if we could get rid
of the leaves in time.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.336
METZLER: Well, the problem
there isn't just the leaves.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.873
It's the access roads.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.576
O'BRIEN: There's gonna be
10,000 people here.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.511

that's what I'm saying.

Jackie.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.115
Hey.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.280
Where are we going?

42:23.400 --> 42:25.277
He can't just be
buried anywhere.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.269
He deserves more.

42:27.440 --> 42:28.919
(JACKIE BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:30.480 --> 42:31.799
Watch your step.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.393
You all right?

42:36.480 --> 42:38.471
My shoes are sticking
in the mud.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.795
I think maybe you should
talk to a priest.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.428
Maybe.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.871
Bobby, I want to
talk to the press.

43:42.960 --> 43:43.995
No.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.195
No. You let
Dave handle that.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.472
You know, that first night
Bob McNamara said

44:02.560 --> 44:05.313
he'd buy back our house
for us in Georgetown.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.070
I don't even
have things. I...

44:11.160 --> 44:12.639
I don't have things.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.312
I don't even have a home.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.232
And what about this house?

44:16.320 --> 44:19.471
This? It's awfully cold.

44:19.560 --> 44:22.313
Well, you could light a fire,
invite people over.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.656
The parties that you threw
at the White House,

44:26.680 --> 44:28.716
nobody had ever
seen anything like that.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.752
Private concerts with artists,
friends, drinking champagne

44:33.880 --> 44:34.915
and singing...

44:35.000 --> 44:36.752
Are you suggesting
I throw a party?

44:37.720 --> 44:40.678
No, not now, obviously.
But, no. Uh...

44:40.760 --> 44:43.194
I'm only suggesting
that you've, uh...

44:44.520 --> 44:48.354
That you've brought life
to a cold house before.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.431
That house was not mine.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.238
Neither is this one.
Nothing is ever mine.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.951
Not to keep, anyway.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.350
Leaving that house
must have been very difficult.

45:03.440 --> 45:07.035
A First Lady must always be
ready to pack her suitcases.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.758
It's inevitable.

45:13.960 --> 45:16.030
We've found beds for
almost all the family.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.036
The Trumans at Blair House.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.634
There was a brief crisis about
him not having a driver,

45:22.760 --> 45:24.239
but Ike offered his.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.550
We're running
a bed-and-breakfast.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.392
Lyndon just wants to
move into the Oval.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.471
He wants to
address Congress.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.471
I'll hold him off
as long as I can,

45:35.560 --> 45:37.551
but it has to happen
sooner or later.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.313
They're worried
about an outdoor procession.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.311
They think
it's a security risk.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.154
Jackie.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.918
They think
it's a security risk.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.479
Everyone's spooked.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.592
Apparently even
State's discouraging

45:54.680 --> 45:56.671
foreign dignitaries
from attending.

45:57.760 --> 46:01.150
It's eight city blocks
to St. Matthew's.

46:01.240 --> 46:04.437
That's a long way to be
strolling through crowds.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.275
All those rooftops.
All those windows.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.036
Bobby,
it's our last chance.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.636
We have to march with him.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.393
MAN: (SINGING)
It's true, it's true

47:11.840 --> 47:14.149
The crown has made it clear

47:14.400 --> 47:16.755
The climate must be perfect

47:17.200 --> 47:19.077
All the year

47:19.760 --> 47:23.355
A law was made
a distant moon ago here

47:24.360 --> 47:27.397
July and August
cannot be too hot

47:28.400 --> 47:32.359
And there's a legal limit
to the snow here

47:32.760 --> 47:34.273
In Camelot

47:37.120 --> 47:40.590
The winter is forbidden
till December

47:41.600 --> 47:44.592
And exits March the second
on the dot

47:45.440 --> 47:49.274
By order, summer lingers
through September

47:49.800 --> 47:51.233
In Camelot

47:54.200 --> 47:57.192
Camelot, Camelot

47:57.760 --> 48:00.354
I know it
sounds a bit bizarre

48:02.080 --> 48:03.638
But in Camelot

48:04.800 --> 48:05.949
Camelot

48:06.760 --> 48:08.796
That's how conditions are

48:11.040 --> 48:14.555
The rain may never fall
till after sundown

48:15.400 --> 48:18.312
By 8:00, the morning fog
must disappear

48:19.560 --> 48:23.792
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

48:23.960 --> 48:27.475
For happy-ever-aftering
(GROANS)

48:27.560 --> 48:32.998
Than here in Camelot

48:33.120 --> 48:35.315
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

48:53.520 --> 48:56.512
Camelot, Camelot

48:57.120 --> 48:59.509
I know it
gives a person pause

49:01.480 --> 49:03.198
But in Camelot

49:04.200 --> 49:05.349
Camelot

49:06.040 --> 49:08.349
Those are the legal laws

49:10.360 --> 49:13.477
The snow may never slush
upon the hillside

49:14.520 --> 49:17.432
By 9:00 p.m.
the moonlight must appear

49:18.720 --> 49:22.633
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot

49:23.200 --> 49:26.636
For happy-ever-aftering

49:26.720 --> 49:32.033
Than here in Camelot

49:34.720 --> 49:36.039
(MUSIC ENDS)

49:41.360 --> 49:42.713
How would you write that?

49:43.520 --> 49:45.909
"She lights yet
another cigarette

49:46.680 --> 49:49.990
"and explains
through her soft sobs

49:50.080 --> 49:51.308
"that Jack wasn't perfect,

49:51.400 --> 49:53.994
"but he was perfect
for our country.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.551
"And I ask about his flaws,

49:56.720 --> 49:58.153
"and she explains..."

49:58.320 --> 49:59.753
Perfect people
can't change.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.230
Jack was always
getting better,

50:02.360 --> 50:03.713
stronger.

50:04.760 --> 50:08.230
Sometimes he would
walk into the desert alone,

50:09.040 --> 50:11.918
just to let himself
be tempted by the devil.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.509
But he'd always
come back to us,

50:15.600 --> 50:17.079
his beloved family.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.438
(EXHALES)

50:22.400 --> 50:23.913
And I don't smoke.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.357
JACKIE: I shouldn't
say these things.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.315
PRIEST: That's why
we're here, isn't it?

50:35.440 --> 50:36.793
To talk about
what happened?

50:38.720 --> 50:40.517
Is this a confession?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.790
Only if there's
something you regret.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.557
Everyone knows my story.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.589
God isn't interested
in stories.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.109
He's interested
in the truth.

50:53.560 --> 50:56.028
I came here looking
for sympathy, Father.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.519
Of course.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.391
Father, are you listening?

51:04.400 --> 51:05.833
I'm listening.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.758
Yes, I think so.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.437
I think God is cruel.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.190
Well, now you're
getting into trouble.

51:18.560 --> 51:19.993
God is love.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.071
And God is everywhere.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.594
Was he in the bullet
that killed Jack?

51:28.960 --> 51:30.313
Absolutely.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.632
Is he inside me now?

51:33.240 --> 51:35.310
Yes, of course.
Of course he is.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.036
Well, that's a funny
game he plays,

51:38.120 --> 51:39.633
hiding all the time.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.536
(CHUCKLING) The fact that
we don't understand him

51:41.560 --> 51:43.198
isn't funny at all.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.476
If there's a heaven,
then there's your God,

51:46.560 --> 51:48.676
with all his empty promises.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.399
What kind of God
takes a father

51:50.480 --> 51:52.357
from his
two little children?

51:52.440 --> 51:54.715
Thy Lord sacrificed
his only son...

51:54.840 --> 51:56.512
And my two babies.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.757
Arabella in the womb.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.354
And Patrick.
Thirty-nine hours on Earth.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.908
Just long enough
to fall in love with him.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.031
What did I do
to deserve that?

52:07.760 --> 52:08.875
Nothing.

52:11.080 --> 52:14.197
Jack and I hardly ever
spent the night together.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.840
Not even that last night
in Fort Worth.

52:18.680 --> 52:21.353
Your husband loved you,
Mrs. Kennedy. I'm sure of it.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.591
I seem to remember
there being more to our vows.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.878
Don't look at me like that.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.752
I was First Lady
of the United States.

52:31.840 --> 52:35.116
Women have endured
far worse for far less.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.472
There are two kinds of women.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.312
Those who want power
in the world,

52:39.400 --> 52:41.914
and those who
want power in bed.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.392
(CHUCKLES) Of course,
now what am I left with?

52:50.040 --> 52:53.191
When men see me now,
what do you think they feel?

52:55.040 --> 52:56.268
Sadness.

52:57.160 --> 52:58.559
Compassion.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.192
Desire, maybe.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.874
You're still a young woman,
Mrs. Kennedy.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.150
I used to make them smile.

53:14.920 --> 53:17.878
No one understands
the pain he was in

53:17.960 --> 53:19.678
and how loyal he was.

53:19.800 --> 53:22.314
Just some of his friends
were so crude.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.119
Jack wasn't, of course.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.031
But he could get
caught up in it.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.755
Still, he was
a great father.

53:34.520 --> 53:37.432
I picture him on that
rocking chair in his office,

53:37.520 --> 53:39.795
Caroline and John
at his feet.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.557
How could I hate him?

53:44.800 --> 53:47.030
Take comfort
in those memories.

53:47.680 --> 53:48.999
I can't.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.350
They're mixed up
with all the others.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.753
Do you have the latest list
from the State Department?

54:04.320 --> 54:06.834
The dignitaries planning
to attend the funeral.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.593
NANCY: Oh, yes.
I have it right here.

54:11.720 --> 54:12.755
General de Gaulle.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.034
Prince Phillip.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.270
Even the Soviet
Foreign Minister.

54:16.720 --> 54:17.869
More than we were expecting?

54:17.960 --> 54:18.960
Oh, yes.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.194
There's dozens of names.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.315
Good.

54:22.680 --> 54:23.999
Will you read them to me?

54:24.160 --> 54:25.513
Yes.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.989
Um, from the United Nations,

54:29.640 --> 54:32.757
there's Paul Hoffman,
Managing Director,

54:33.440 --> 54:35.078
David B. Vaughan.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.039
The King of Belgium.

54:38.120 --> 54:40.190
Denmark,
the Crown Prince George.

54:40.280 --> 54:43.670
Bulgaria, the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.233
Canada,
it's the Prime Minister,

54:45.320 --> 54:46.548
Lester B. Pearson.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.596
Austria, the Chancellor.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.320
I don't know.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.994
I think you should just
try it without it.

54:54.560 --> 54:55.754
(SIGHS)

55:00.400 --> 55:02.436
We've been together
a long time,

55:02.520 --> 55:03.999
haven't we, Nancy?

55:04.080 --> 55:05.957
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

55:08.320 --> 55:11.039
I used to worry that
you might be jealous of me.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.160
Oh, stop it.

55:12.240 --> 55:15.516
No, you never did anything
to make me feel that way.

55:16.600 --> 55:19.239
But I worried.
After I married Jack.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.356
After he won the election.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.470
Now that seems ridiculous,

55:24.560 --> 55:28.473
anyone...
Anyone being jealous of me.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.271
I've buried two children,

55:31.360 --> 55:33.476
and now I'm burying
my husband.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.756
You know, I was jealous.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.637
Of that dress
you wore in Vienna.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.073
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)

55:47.120 --> 55:49.714
I know that it's hard
to see it right now,

55:49.800 --> 55:52.598
but you have your whole
life ahead of you.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.878
That's a terrible
thing to say.

55:55.960 --> 55:57.075
You do!

55:57.160 --> 55:59.435
That's a terrible,
terrible thing to say.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.714
But you do.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.038
(JACKIE BREATHING HEAVILY)

56:04.040 --> 56:05.314
NANCY: I'm sorry.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.474
I'm sorry.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.958
What will you do now?

56:11.120 --> 56:12.599
Oh, I'll stay with you.

56:13.240 --> 56:14.240
You won't go anywhere?

56:14.320 --> 56:15.360
No, I'm not
going anywhere.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.753
I don't have
anywhere to go.

to have you.

No, they're
not lucky at all.

They're not lucky.

56:25.480 --> 56:30.110

I'm scared, I'm scared...

is ready.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.713
Oh, Clint.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.312
We're nearly done here.

57:37.680 --> 57:39.671
It's the strangest thing.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.789
I hardly remember
anything after.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.679
But I read about
what you did in the papers,

57:46.760 --> 57:48.796
and I just wanted
to thank you.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.320
We got to get a handle
on this thing.

57:50.360 --> 57:52.157
We got to get involved.
Yes, sir.

57:53.320 --> 57:56.676
This is making us look like
a bunch of goddamn barbarians.

57:56.760 --> 57:59.797
Mrs. Kennedy is on her
way down with the children.

58:00.240 --> 58:01.832
Turn the television off!

58:04.680 --> 58:06.830
You're not to speak
a word of this.

58:07.240 --> 58:10.596
Understood? I'll tell Jackie
when the time is right.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.309
Sit down.

I need to hear.

Mrs. Kennedy...

58:32.800 --> 58:34.756
I was ten yards back
when I heard the first shot.

Mrs. Kennedy...

I need to talk to him.

I don't... I don't know
about that, Mrs. Kennedy.

59:29.520 --> 59:30.999
to every corner
of the world.

59:31.080 --> 59:33.674
Those pictures
should record the truth.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.633
Two heartbroken,

59:35.720 --> 59:37.915
fatherless children
are part of that.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.911
You can tell them
I'm ready to leave,

59:42.000 --> 59:43.228
with Caroline and John.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.639
Yes, Mrs. Kennedy.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.039
Nancy?
Yes?

59:46.400 --> 59:48.470
I'm not
the First Lady anymore.

59:49.240 --> 59:51.037
You can call me Jackie.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.274
I will.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.273
Caroline, are you ready,
sweetheart?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.513
My brave girl.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.751
(JOHN JR. CRYING)

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.797
Oh, John, John, John.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.117
Let me take you, son.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.111
JACKIE: I value my privacy.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.474
I always have.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.198
And yet,
in the days after,

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.669
directly after,
something seemed to change.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.869
In what way?

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.154
Before the funeral,

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.959
the day you moved
the casket to the Capitol,

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.315
well, your children
were on full display

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.833
for the whole world to see.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.433
Well, what
are you insinuating,

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.595
that I exploited them?

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.955
Oh, no, of course not.
I just, um...

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.033
OFFICER: Present arms!

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.671
JOURNALIST:
I'm only wondering if you ever

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.830
considered to do more
to shield them.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.434
I think that most people
would have...

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.670
We aren't most people.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.750
Most people don't have to
make decisions like that,

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.115
hours after watching
their husband get murdered

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.389
next to them.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.553
Oh, Lyndon.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.033
What an awful way
to begin your presidency.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.996
Are you saying
it was a mistake?

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.313
No, of course not.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.313
JACKIE: How dare you?

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.756
They murdered him
inside the jail.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.515
These people
can get to anyone.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.431
How dare you
keep that from me?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.919
You had no right!
The children?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.136
The ceremony
at the Capitol...

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.296
I took them
out the front door.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.673
Are you...
This is all insanity!

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.760
You and your brother.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.592
All these years,
all your goddamn secrets!

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.960
That's not fair... Caroline
and John are all I have left,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.389
and I put them in danger
because of you.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.311
I would never
put you at risk.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.879
You can't know that!

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.150
You think you all
control everything,

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.754
that you have the world
on puppet strings.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.190
And you're ridiculous.
And I let myself believe it.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.351
And this parade?
Who is it really for?

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.555
For Jack?

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.717
One more campaign stop
along the way to the grave?

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.356
Lyndon's people are right.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.549
It's not worth it.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.232
It's not worth
risking people's lives.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.276
You tell them
we're calling it off.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.913
We'll motorcade
to the Cathedral.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The back way.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.514
And then we'll bury him,
and we put an end to all this.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.397
I don't give
a damn anymore.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.199
I don't.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.736
I would never put you
and the children in danger.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.399
I know you think I'm some
silly little debutante.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.317
Listen to me. You don't
protect me anymore.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.994
I would never put you
and the children in danger.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.597
You don't know anything.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.519
I lie awake at night,
and all I can think is

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.152
I should have been
a shop girl

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.593
or a stenographer.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.595
I should have married
an ordinary, lazy, ugly man.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.910
Let me share
with you a parable.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.633
Jesus

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.317
once passed a blind
beggar on the road,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.072
and his disciples asked,
"Who sinned,

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.831
"this man or his parents,
that he should be born blind?"

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.070
And Jesus said,

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.391
"Neither this man
nor his parents sinned.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.398
"He was made blind

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.512
"so that the works of God
could be revealed in him."

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.359
And with that,
he placed mud on his eyes

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.917
and told him to wash
in the Pool of Siloam.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.757
And the man did,
and he came back seeing.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.712
Right now you are blind.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.074
Not because you've sinned,

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.230
but because
you've been chosen.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.470
So that the works of God
can be revealed in you.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.068
It's perfect.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.716
We installed it
while you were away.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.399
I thought
it'd be a nice surprise

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.589
for you and the President.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.079
It changes everything.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.799
And the Treaty Room?

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.313
Hunter green.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.911
Exactly as you imagined it.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.553
I wish Jack...

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.430
Who knows
if he would have cared?

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.716
I lost track,
somewhere...

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.193
What was real.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.633
What was performance.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.550
Well, he was a president.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.918
You were right earlier.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.639
I'm not going to
march tomorrow.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.073
I won't put people in danger
on account of my vanity.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.829
I was scared for you.
I still am.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.319
But I never thought
it was vanity.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.590
You know, that's what
Jack called all this.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.794
When he saw what we
were spending, he said,

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.072
"Your little vanity project

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.112
"is going to bankrupt
the federal government."

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.353
It gives them strength.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.435
They need to know that
real men actually lived here.

and overcame it.

What you've done
in this house matters.

That's kind of you, Bill.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.995
Even I'm starting
to lose him.

Pretty soon

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.476

another oil portrait

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.239
No procession.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.798
I'm sorry, Bobby.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.789
Do you think
Lincoln's widow knew?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.679
What?

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.354
That we'd build a monument
to her husband?

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.158
Why is this room
so peaceful?

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.196
"Peaceful"? I don't know.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.953
Every time I walk
by this room,

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.828
I'm reminded that
on January 1st, 1863,

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.276
an ordinary man
signed a document

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:43.033
that freed four million people
from slavery.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.879
So,

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.631
I don't think of it
so much as peaceful

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.032
as a place
of profound legacy.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.310
And it's too bad that ours
is totally fucking wasted.

What did we accomplish, huh?

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.158
We're just... We're just
the beautiful people?

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.673
Right? Isn't that
what we are?

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.238
Bobby.
Because what did we...

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.880
What did we truly accomplish?

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.399
Maybe Jack will be remembered

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:22.856
for the way he handled
the missile crisis,

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.279
or maybe he'll be remembered

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.759
for having created a crisis

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.716

forced to solve.

gets to handle Vietnam.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.871
We teed it up for him.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.951
He gets to knock it down.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.112
I shouldn't have pushed him
so hard on Castro.

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.395
You can't
do that, Bobby.

The Attorney General
relayed to me your desire

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.439
for a more modest ceremony.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.473
It's not the same.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.754
If it were up to him,

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.070
he'd do anything that
might bring you comfort.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.279
Then who is it up to,
Mr. Valenti?

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.475
Well, as I'm sure
you know,

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.028
tomorrow we're expecting
close to 100 Heads of State.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.878
One-hundred three.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.228
Yes, I'm sure that's right.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.551
And I suspect they'll make
all their own decisions.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.471
Based on what?

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.956
There's a great deal
of classified intelligence

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.996
that I just can't get into.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.856
We've intercepted a threat
against General de Gaulle

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.711
from our assets in Geneva.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.072
I'm afraid if he refuses
to march, others may follow.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.992
I understand.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.433
As I said, Mrs. Kennedy,

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.576
I wish there were
more we could do

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.079
to accommodate
your wishes.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.394
I'm terribly sorry.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.748
Don't be.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.070
You and the Johnsons
have already done so much.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.394
Good day, Mrs. Kennedy.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.919
Um, Mr. Valenti.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.553
Would you mind
getting a message

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.240
to all our funeral guests
when they land?

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.880
Of course.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.111
Inform them that I will walk
with Jack tomorrow.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.712
Alone, if necessary.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.916
And tell General de Gaulle

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.554
that if he wishes to ride
in an armored car

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.392
or in a tank
for that matter,

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.074
I won't blame him.

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.030
And I'm sure
the tens of millions of people

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.758
watching won't either.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.398
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Kennedy?

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.550
Oh, I'm just doing my job.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.709
Would you like
to write this down?

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.152
Do you think I should?
I...

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.559
I do.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.990
We all live on
far after our deaths.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.068
Presidents will
come and go,

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.037
and every one of them

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.998
will look up to Jack
for guidance,

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.749
for inspiration.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.798
What do you say to those
who say he didn't deserve it?

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.908
The scale of it. I mean,
he was a great president,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.833
but he didn't win
the Civil War, for instance.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.915
It was a funeral for

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.996
the President
of the United States.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.239
Your husband drove cars,
he didn't ride horses.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.976
Yes, and there should
have been more of them.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.319
There should
be more horses,

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.796
more soldiers,
more crying, more cameras!

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.190
I'm guessing you won't
allow me to write any of that.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.629
No,

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.198
because I never
said that.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.952
Perhaps Jack didn't have time
to defeat Communism,

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.798
but I do seem to recall...

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.393
With all due respect,

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.835
you were at the center
of it all, Mrs. Kennedy,

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:11.073
and I'd imagine
it's impossible

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.151
to have any perspective
from that vantage point.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.153
But I can assure you that
it was a spectacle.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.436
JACKIE: Nancy said
they wanted to share my grief,

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.788
so I let them.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.957
But after, I realized
that all the pageantry,

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.598
all the demands
I made to honor him,

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.391
it wasn't for Jack
or his legacy.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.833
It was for me.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.879
(INAUDIBLE)

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.472
JACKIE: I wrote him a letter.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.955
That night, before we moved
the casket to the Capitol.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.678
Do you know what I wrote?

01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.993
That I wanted to die.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.198
I understand.
Do you?

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.389
I do.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.029
Unless you are
asking my permission.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.513
No, only crass,

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.148
self-indulgent people
kill themselves.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.716
No, I was just hoping
that if I walked

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.671
down the street
next to Jack's body,

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.832
maybe someone would be
kind enough to do it for me.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.876
In front of
the whole world?

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.114
Famous life, famous death.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.677
I never wanted fame.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.032
I just became a Kennedy.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.190
JACKIE: I told everyone
that I can't remember.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.599
It's not true.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.993
I can remember.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.473
I can remember everything.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.916
The first bullet. Boom.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.435
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Then boom.

(GUNSHOT)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.993
I could have saved him.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.079
I should have known
it was a gunshot.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.071
I should have shielded him.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.635
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.994
I tried to stop the bleeding,

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.720
but when we got
to the hospital, it was...

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.518
That night,
and every night since,

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.119
I pray to die.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.758
Won't God let me be
with my husband?

(PRIEST SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

It's just the...
It hasn't...

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.755
You don't write
very legibly, do you?

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.470
You left your mark on this
country, Mrs. Kennedy.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.233
These past few days,
that's the story.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.913
Losing a president is like...
It's like losing a father.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.360
And you were a mother
to all of us,

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.078
and that's
a very good story.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.640
The entire country
watched the funeral

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.678
from beginning to end.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.832
Decades from now,

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.836
people will remember
your dignity and the majesty.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.032
They'll remember you.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.470
JACKIE: It will serve
a definite purpose.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.518
My husband has
so many meetings up here,

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.640
in this part of the house.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.998
All the men who wait to
see him now sit in the hall,

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.594
with baby carriages
going by them.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.477
So they can sit in here

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.597
and have a conference around
this table, waiting for him.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.920
COLLINGWOOD: Well,
he's going to come in, uh...

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.913
Mr. President.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.035
Well, Mrs., uh...

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.235
Mr. Collingwood.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.595
Mrs. Kennedy
has been showing us

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.874
about the White House

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.589
and all the changes
that she's made therein.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.399
What do you think of
the changes that she's made?

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.038
Well, I think
the great effort

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.350
that she's made
has been to, uh,

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.635
bring us much more
intimately in contact

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.278
with all the men
who lived here.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.873
Of course,
I think anyone who comes

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.518
to the White House
as a President, uh,

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.875
desires the best
for his country.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.551
But I think he does receive
a stimulus from the knowledge

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.599
of living in close proximity
to the people

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.590
who are legendary,

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.359
but who actually were alive
and were in these rooms.

Everything will be
held in storage

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.116

where to settle.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.157
JACKIE: There's one last thing.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.555
It's more important
than all the rest.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.556
You know,
every night before bed,

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.358
we had this old Victrola.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.031
We'd listen
to a couple records.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.475
His favorite was Camelot.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.709
The musical?

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.518
Oh, I'm so
ashamed of myself.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.352
Every quote
out of Jack's mouth

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.510
was either Greek or Roman.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.750
And that last song,
that last side of Camelot,

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.400
is all that keeps running
through my mind.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.996
"Don't let it be forgot,

(INAUDIBLE)

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.713
Jack loved history.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.358
It's what made him
what he was.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.919
Just imagine,
he was a little boy

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.479
with scarlet fever in bed,

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.993
reading history.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.839
King Arthur and the Knights
of the Round Table.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.638
That's what Camelot is about.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:38.554
Ordinary men banding together
to fight for a better world.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.271
Don't misunderstand me.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.032
Jack wasn't naive.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.472
But he had ideals.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.512
Ideals he could rally
others to believe in.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.355
Will those ideals
live on?

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.033
Sure they will.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.395
Of course, there will
be great progress.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.436
There will be
other great presidents.

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.353
The Johnsons have been
so generous to me.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.990
But there won't be
another Camelot.

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.437
Not another Camelot.

every night to die.

That your children
have no use for you.

with your husband.

And yet, I'm not
burying you today.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.191
There comes a time
in man's search for meaning,

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.316
when one realizes

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.316
that there are no answers.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.397

to that horrible,

unavoidable
realization,

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.556
you accept it
or you kill yourself.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:08.110
turn off the lights,
and stare into the dark,

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.273
I wonder...

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.195
Is this all there is?

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.518
You wonder?

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.396
Every soul
on this planet does.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.639
But then,
when morning comes,

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.280
we all wake up
and make a pot of coffee.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.799
JACKIE: Why do we bother?

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.393
PRIEST: Because we do.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.631
You did this morning.
You will again tomorrow.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.075
But God,
in his infinite wisdom,

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.752
has made sure

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.670
it is just enough for us.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:51.430
Once more. Mrs. Kennedy
has expressed her desire

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.399
to re-inter the bodies
of the two children they lost

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.789
to rest alongside
their father.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.552
You got that part, right?

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.832
She wants them
to always remember,

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.559
for one brief,
shining moment,

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.790
there was a...

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.110
Yeah, Camelot. Yeah.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.559
(HANGS UP)

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.674
I hope you have a good night,
Mrs. Kennedy.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.910
JACKIE:
He wrote down every word.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.592
Did it help heal you?

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.148
It's been reprinted
all over the world.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.471
Maybe that's what they'll
all believe now. Camelot.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.750
People like to believe
in fairy tales.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.034
And you?

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.280
Do you believe
you did him justice?

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.954
I believe that the characters
we read about on the page

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.715
end up being more real than
the men who stand beside us.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.833
I should have guessed

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.275
it was too much to ask
that we grow old together,

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.751
see our children
grow up.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.435
The darkness
may never go away,

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.908
but it won't always
be this heavy.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.349
Come.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.436
They're waiting for us
at Arlington.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.472
In the name of the Father,

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.114
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.958
In the name of the Father,

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:35.350
the Son,
and the Holy Spirit...

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:07.635
MAN: (SINGING) Each evening,
from December to December

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.550
Before you drift
to sleep upon your cot

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:18.348
Think back on all the tales
that you remember

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.871
Of Camelot

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.114
Ask every person
if he's heard the story

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.073
And tell it strong...

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.995
JACKIE: I was just so happy
that he could be proud.

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.594
Because then
I was having a baby,

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:40.755
and I couldn't campaign,

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.751
and then we got
in the White House,

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:45.593
and all of the things
I'd always done,

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.592
suddenly they
became wonderful.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.910
Because anything
the First Lady does

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.753
that is different
everyone seizes on.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.356
And I was just
so happy for Jack

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.954
that he could be proud of me.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.310
Those were our happiest years.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.958
(SINGING) Where once it never
rained till after sundown

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:16.797
By 8:00 a.m.,
the morning fog had flown

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.309
Don't let it be forgot

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.388
That once there was a spot

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.117
For one brief,
shining moment

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.035
That was known

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:38.798
As Camelot

01:32:39.305 --> 01:32:45.308
