WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.771
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, friends,
you remember our Jane.

00:03.804 --> 00:05.539
Accidentally
artificially inseminated.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.808
Torn between Rafael,
her baby's father,

00:07.841 --> 00:09.577
and Michael, her fiancé.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.645
And she chose Michael.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.514
I always recommend couples
write a letter to each other

00:13.547 --> 00:17.485
before the wedding to read later
when times get tougher.

00:17.518 --> 00:21.222
Whoa. Oh, look at this. It's
like the best hiding spot ever.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.790
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And then,
the worst thing happened.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.692
And Michael died.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.627
And nearly four years later,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.429
Jane was finally open
to love again,

00:28.462 --> 00:30.498
with one difference.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.734
Not really feeling as full of
"meant to be" these days.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.736
Maybe re-read Michael's letter.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.838
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so,
she ran to their old apartment,

00:37.871 --> 00:40.808
and, yeah, it wasn't there.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.776
But still, all was not lost
on the love front.

00:42.810 --> 00:46.680
See? Jane's parents were
finally getting married,

00:46.714 --> 00:48.616
despite a little hiccup.
It's your dad's.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.519
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, and speaking of baby mamas,

00:51.552 --> 00:53.387
Rafael and Petra
got back together,

00:53.421 --> 00:55.556
but Petra pulled away,
because she thought

00:55.589 --> 00:57.825
there was still something
between Rafael and Jane.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.394
And here's a secret, friends:
Jane did have feelings

01:00.428 --> 01:02.396
for Rafael,
but before I get there,

01:02.430 --> 01:04.632
Rafael's sister Luisa
had a powwow

01:04.665 --> 01:06.667
with Petra's sister Anezka,

01:06.700 --> 01:07.801
which didn't turn out great
for Rafael.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.371
Everything is mine.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.606
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And back to Jane's feelings.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.542
She was on her way
to tell Rafael when...

01:14.575 --> 01:16.544
Jane. A couple from
your old apartment

01:16.577 --> 01:18.279
got in touch with the
tenant from before them.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.281
Something about
a floorboard?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.415
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brought her back

01:21.449 --> 01:22.483
to her first love.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.851
MAN:
Jane.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.786
JANE:
Adam?

01:25.819 --> 01:27.455
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh,
and one last thing, friends.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.290
Remember Jane's adorable son?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.558
Well, he's still adorable,

01:30.591 --> 01:31.892
but now he looks like this:

01:31.925 --> 01:33.694
What can I say?

01:33.727 --> 01:36.630
In novellas, you must be
prepared for change after all.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.868
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
When Adam Eduardo Alvaro

01:40.901 --> 01:42.503
was 25 years old,

01:42.536 --> 01:45.639
he found a love letter
in a floorboard

01:45.673 --> 01:48.676
that altered the course
of his life.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.312
It wasn't even written to him.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.582
It was written
to someone named Jane.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.749
(bell rings)

01:55.783 --> 01:57.618
But, oh, how it spoke to him,

01:57.651 --> 02:00.588
in terms of what love
should feel like.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.324
And so he finally broke up
with Heather,

02:03.357 --> 02:06.660
even though he tattooed
her name on his arm.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.663
And he kept the letter
in his wallet

02:09.697 --> 02:12.600
because, well, you know Adam.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.835
He did those kinds of things.

02:14.868 --> 02:19.340
But imagine his surprise
when he found out that Jane

02:19.373 --> 02:21.409
was his Jane.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.743
Wait, what was her last name?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.546
Villanueva.
Jane Villanueva.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.416
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes, friends, that Jane,

02:28.449 --> 02:31.852
as in the girl he'd almost
married when he was 19.

02:31.885 --> 02:35.489
So, can you blame him
for thinking that was a sign?

02:35.523 --> 02:38.892
And, you know,
our Adam loved signs.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.431
(record scratches)

02:43.464 --> 02:44.865
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, hello. I'm so sorry.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.467
I don't know what happened.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.368
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
I'm introducing Adam.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.836
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Shh. Not yet.

02:48.869 --> 02:53.474
Ah, let's begin again,
shall we?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.810
When Jane saw Adam again
after eight years,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.979
he had brought
Michael's letter.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.948
Plus, cranes were flying.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.618
So, can you blame Jane for
believing this was meant to be?

03:04.652 --> 03:06.987
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR: Or Adam?
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But this is about Jane.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.689
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR: There
were fewer cranes, honestly.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.923
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I don't care.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.475
I can't believe you lived
in that apartment.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.842
And that the tenants
called you.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.711
I thought they thought
I was crazy.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.413
Oh, yeah, they definitely
thought that you were crazy.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.847
(laughs)

03:33.881 --> 03:36.950
So, I guess we found
our way back after all.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.786
(record scratches)

03:38.819 --> 03:40.621
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, I'm so sorry again.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.456
This is confusing.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.525
The problem is, I didn't start
from the beginning

03:44.558 --> 03:45.626
because I was thrown.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.562
All right, last time.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.632
As you know,
Jane Gloriana Villanueva,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.635
grew up dreaming
about telenovela love.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.770
But she didn't think
it could happen to her

03:56.804 --> 03:59.840
until she was 19 years old.

03:59.873 --> 04:04.712
His name is Adam
and he's kind of artistic.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
And once our Jane fell...

04:06.614 --> 04:08.015
well, she fell fast.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.049
So...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.684
Very fast.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.453
Adam just got into NYU's
Studio Art program.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.555
It's so prestigious.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.558
He didn't think he was gonna
get in, but I knew he would

04:17.591 --> 04:18.992
'cause he's so talented.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.761
Keep going, babe.
Sorry, babe. Right.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.664
Anyway, uh, he asked
me to go with him,

04:23.697 --> 04:25.032
and I started going on

04:25.065 --> 04:27.067
about how it's not practical,
and I couldn't afford it,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.736
and I wasn't gonna
live with somebody

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
that I wasn't married to,
and that's when I saw

04:30.804 --> 04:33.474
he was down on one knee.
We're engaged!

04:33.507 --> 04:35.476
No, what the hell
are you talking about?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.977
Mom, Abuela, wait.
No, you are way too young.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.879
I am over 18.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.681
ADAM:
Okay, hold up.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.049
You can't talk to my
fiancée that way.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.090
JANE:
Abuela, enough.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.026
I'm getting married next week
and you are going to be there

04:53.060 --> 04:56.897
because you are family
and family shows up.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.834
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And for
the record, they did show up.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.736
(doorbell rings)
Unfortunately...

05:07.040 --> 05:09.109
And I just think that
everyone's right.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.845
We're not ready.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.647
(echoing): And I know you
don't want to live together...

05:13.681 --> 05:14.715
...moving
to a new city.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.517
...too hard.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.686
...um, clean break, just...

05:18.719 --> 05:21.955
(quietly):
But...

05:21.989 --> 05:23.991
I love you.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.926
I love you,
too, so much.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.128
I don't know. Who knows?

05:28.161 --> 05:31.932
Maybe we'll make our
way back to each other.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.934
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And friends, Jane knew

05:33.967 --> 05:35.569
it couldn't end this way.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.070
Remember, this was true love.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.540
Telenovela love.
ADAM: Babe.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.341
You got to let
go of the bike.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.681
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And yet, it did end that way.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.918
Until, of course, now.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
I'd love to catch up,

05:52.986 --> 05:55.989
but you probably
have somewhere to be

05:56.023 --> 05:57.825
in that giant
purple dress.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.826
It's lavender.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.060
Oh.
(laughs)

06:00.093 --> 06:01.161
Sorry.
And the wedding's over.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.163
Let's catch up.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.733
So, who got married?

06:05.766 --> 06:08.101
My mom to my dad.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.970
ADAM: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, back up.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.640
You found your pops?
Mm-hmm.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.575
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to her pops...

06:14.608 --> 06:16.744
(gasps)
...who had, indeed,
married her mom...

06:16.777 --> 06:17.945
What?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.980
Darci just announced
the pregnancy.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.917
...after discovering he was
going to be a pops again.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.026
She's making it seem like I
turned my back on my child.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.601
(gasps)
No!

06:40.634 --> 06:43.170
Do not escalate
the situation.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.739
You have an ironclad
custody contract.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.940
Isn't that what
your lawyer said?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.643
Yes, he did.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.049
(groans)
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.718
You will be at
the next sonogram
(elevator bell dings)

06:57.751 --> 06:59.119
because you have
legal rights.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.856
Now, let's turn off our phones
because we just got married

07:02.890 --> 07:04.625
and tonight's about us.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.159
I love you,
Mrs. de la Vega.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.995
I love you, too,
Mr. de la Vega.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.062
(elevator bell dings)

07:12.165 --> 07:13.667
Babe Adam?

07:15.669 --> 07:16.904
Who is Babe Adam?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.105
A comic book artist.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.873
Hmm.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.743
Or graphic novels if
I'm trying to impress you,

07:22.776 --> 07:25.846
which-which I am,
so let's go with that.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.648
I'm impressed.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.217
You're actually making
a living as an artist.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.886
"Making a living"
in a loose definition.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.688
(chuckles)

07:34.722 --> 07:36.657
So, are you a teacher,

07:36.690 --> 07:38.025
per the whole
ten-year life plan?

07:38.058 --> 07:41.161
Nope. I actually decided
that I wanted to be...

07:41.194 --> 07:43.664
A crazy person, both of you.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.165
You can't spy on them.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.067
Keep your voice down.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.670
The babysitter said Mateo
just got to sleep.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.706
Seriously. I mean, how
bad could this guy be?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.810
JANE:
"Heathen."

07:56.844 --> 07:58.145
Covering an ex's name.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.814
You must've had
a lot of exes.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.849
(laughs): No.

08:01.882 --> 08:02.983
(laughs)

08:03.016 --> 08:05.686
No, these, um, they mark

08:05.719 --> 08:07.220
mostly important moments
in my life, you know?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.723
Oh, wait, are you
still into astrology?

08:09.757 --> 08:13.226
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Seriously?
A bad boy into astrology?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.895
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
It has to do with his sister

08:14.928 --> 08:16.964
who died of cancer. Dick.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.832
So, how's the family?
Abuela?

08:18.866 --> 08:20.768
Great. So supportive.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.073
Well, it's definitely him.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.743
Who cares? Jane has a good
head on her shoulders.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.820
(giggles)
That smile, though.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.855
I'm sorry, what were
we talking about?

08:41.889 --> 08:43.991
I was asking about
your original comic,

08:44.024 --> 08:46.059
or graphic novel
because I'm impressed.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.862
Right. I know the story.
I've drawn it.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.864
I just need the words now.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.999
After you've drawn it?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.734
Yeah, for me...

08:53.767 --> 08:54.735
the words are
the extra part.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.737
What? No.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.138
Words are everything.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.007
They're how you get
to know a character.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.742
Well, no, that's
through their actions.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.044
How they feel,
what they want.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.013
You don't know
what I want?

09:09.216 --> 09:12.753
(gasps) Oh, my God,
she's taking off her dress.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.154
I think they're going
skinny-dipping.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.923
ROGELIO:
Now?!

09:19.259 --> 09:20.961
Oh, Jane can take
care of herself.

09:20.994 --> 09:21.995
Xiomara!

09:22.029 --> 09:23.997
Don't worry.
I'll save Mommy.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.966
(gasps)
No, no!

09:25.999 --> 09:27.768
Matelio!

09:27.801 --> 09:30.137
(elevator bell dings)

09:30.170 --> 09:33.173
Matelio! Matelio!

09:41.949 --> 09:43.784
Impressive.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.919
You would not
skinny-dip at 19.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.188
I told you I've changed.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.159
(elevator bell dings)

09:52.192 --> 09:53.193
(gasps)

09:56.964 --> 09:59.299
I guess we found our
way back to each other.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.870
MATEO:
Don't worry, Mommy!

10:02.903 --> 10:04.972
I'm here to save you!
(gasps)

10:05.005 --> 10:06.273
Mommy, Mommy, don't you worry!
XIOMARA: Sorry!

10:06.306 --> 10:09.076
Both of you, sorry!
ALBA: Jane! Jane!

10:09.109 --> 10:11.078
Oh, Matelio. Oh.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.880
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.815
maybe Adam should've run
then and there...

10:14.848 --> 10:16.349
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But he didn't.
Adam!

10:16.383 --> 10:19.119
The tide went out.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.865
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR: So, yes,
Adam came home soaking wet.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.867
Thankfully,
his roommates were away.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ugh, you again?
Sorry about that.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.338
....crazy that you were spying
on me in the first place!

10:38.371 --> 10:39.873
I know, and I'm really sorry.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.978
Having fun.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.748
Sweetie, I love that,
but I'm just a little confused,

10:47.781 --> 10:50.083
because two hours ago,
you were about to tell Rafael

10:50.117 --> 10:53.921
that you had feelings for him.
You want to be with Rafael?!

10:53.954 --> 10:55.355
Shh.
I didn't say that.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.957
ROGELIO: Well, this is
a lot to take in.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.191
I mean, I'm not sure how I feel.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.395
No! Case not closed.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.865
Case none of your business.
Got it?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.969
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I guess she don't got it.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.142
(whispers):
Shh. Right here.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.744
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Ooh, la-la!

11:16.777 --> 11:18.011
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, right?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.913
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
But did he hear

11:19.947 --> 11:20.914
about her feelings?

11:20.948 --> 11:22.482
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Not sure. Be quiet.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.818
What are you doing here?
Oh, Luisa kicked me

11:24.852 --> 11:26.720
out of the hotel and
froze all my money,

11:26.754 --> 11:28.421
and I can't find
my phone.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.890
Hey, buddy.
MATEO: Guess what?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.759
Mommy went swimming
naked in the ocean,

11:31.792 --> 11:34.127
and Bisa and
I saved her from

11:34.161 --> 11:35.428
stranger danger.
Okay. (laughs)

11:35.462 --> 11:36.897
Can you put him to bed?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.132
Mm-hmm.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.402
So, what happened
with Luisa?
She found out

11:42.435 --> 11:45.205
that I lied about
my cancer relapse.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.040
What-what feelings?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.176
Just...

11:49.209 --> 11:51.812
romantic ones.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.817
Well, but I-I didn't know
where they were coming from,

11:56.850 --> 11:59.853
or what they meant, which is why
I didn't say anything.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.155
Maybe I was just jealous
that you were dating Petra.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.057
Oh my God.
Petra, she said

12:04.091 --> 12:06.827
that you had feelings for me,
but I called her delusional.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.095
I need to, I
need to apologize.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.496
Can I, can I
use your phone?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.999
Yes, of course.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.435
Jane, wait.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.870
*

12:16.904 --> 12:18.806
You have a text.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.813
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, speaking of Adam...

12:25.846 --> 12:27.948
No worries.
I'm gonna make the deadline.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.450
Yeah, I'm drawing
the big fight scene right now.

12:30.483 --> 12:34.454
(dings)
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup. He's pretty whipped.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.856
I just hope she's worth it.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.892
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Trust me,
Jane is a very special person!

12:38.926 --> 12:40.560
Mateo, this is the last time
I'm saying it.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.195
(water running)
Put your shoes on!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.764
What is it?
What's the matter?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.804
No, that's just a
rich person thing.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.006
He doesn't realize that we have
one bathroom and water bills.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.307
Mm-hmm.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.513
I don't want to discuss it.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.854
(laughs)

13:06.887 --> 13:09.089
We spoke briefly, but then
he had to call Petra back

13:09.122 --> 13:10.590
and apologize
for not trusting her.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.060
And she won't even
call him back because of me.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.963
Huh?
Oh, honestly, the whole
thing's a mess. Hang on.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.968
(man speaking indistinctly)

13:21.001 --> 13:23.303
(water stops running)
Shoot.
That was Mateo's dojo.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.939
Rafael's credit card is
on autopay, and it was denied.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.508
Guess we are taking a break
from karate.
MATEO: I don't want

13:28.541 --> 13:31.111
to take a break from karate.
Well, we're gonna have to,
Mr. Sweetface.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.147
It costs a lot of money,
and right now, we want to save.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.317
Shoes on.
Just tell Daddy to go to
the bank and get some more.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.120
Mateo, I don't like
your attitude.
I'm going.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.123
No, you're not.
Am, too! Am, too!

13:43.156 --> 13:45.625
You stop that! You stop
that right this minute!
No!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.160
Hey, what's going on?

13:48.896 --> 13:52.532
Mommy said we have no money.
Wait, what?

13:52.565 --> 13:54.167
No, I did not say that.
MATEO: Yes, you did.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.269
You said that's why
we can't go to karate.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.271
Okay, hey, calm
down, all right?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.307
There is plenty of money.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.542
Okay? Go get ready.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.079
I obviously
didn't say that.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.015
And clearly,
he's way too spoiled.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.150
I just don't think we should be
talking to him about money.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.352
Period. He's way too young.
(ringtone plays)

14:12.385 --> 14:14.154
Hello?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.323
This is Jane Villanueva.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.060
Oh, my God.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.229
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

14:22.262 --> 14:24.164
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
I'm sorry, who is this rando?

14:24.197 --> 14:26.566
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Petra, I think.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.601
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
What do you mean, "you think"?
Look, it's a long story,

14:28.635 --> 14:30.237
but she's a twin
and they often do this thing

14:30.270 --> 14:32.005
where they switch places.

14:32.039 --> 14:32.906
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
How important can she be

14:32.940 --> 14:34.574
if you're not even sure
who she is?

14:34.607 --> 14:36.143
Petra, thank God.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.178
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
See? It's Petra. Now, shh.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.579
Are you okay?

14:39.612 --> 14:41.681
Well, Anezka lured me
out to the dock last night

14:41.714 --> 14:43.917
and tried to kill me, but, yeah,
other than that, I'm perfect.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.153
Wait, I don't understand.
Lured you how?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.988
She stole your phone
and texted me.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.933
Thought there was
a business emergency.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.002
And when I got out there,
she had a gun.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.006
(phone chimes)

15:06.039 --> 15:07.240
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, well,

15:07.274 --> 15:08.942
she's not gonna check that.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.310
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She's a ding-dong.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.012
Now pay attention.
This is important.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.985
(both shouting)

15:20.320 --> 15:21.254
No!

15:21.288 --> 15:25.258
There was blood everywhere

15:25.292 --> 15:28.195
and the current was so strong.
Oh...

15:28.228 --> 15:30.163
Mrs. Solano?
Yes?

15:30.197 --> 15:31.364
We've got boats
heading out

15:31.398 --> 15:33.066
to see if we can find
your sister,

15:33.100 --> 15:35.002
but it doesn't look good.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.736
Let's just hope she's dead.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.371
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR: Wow,
this lady is a real charmer.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.640
Back to Adam...

15:40.673 --> 15:43.410
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
No, not yet.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.246
Can I borrow your phone
to check my messages?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.215
Oh, of course.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.382
Thank you.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.251
(engine starts)

15:51.284 --> 15:53.220
RAFAEL (over speakers): And I
just wanted to talk to you,

15:53.253 --> 15:54.254
but not over a voice mail,
obviously.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.989
Call me.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.390
Oh, let me just turn off
the Bluetooth.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.758
Hey, Petra, it's Jane.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.993
Raf said you haven't
called back...
Oh.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.095
...and I know you're mad
and you should be,
Shoot. Let me...

16:02.129 --> 16:04.397
but not at him.
It's my fault completely.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.067
I denied that I had feelings
for Rafael

16:07.100 --> 16:08.401
and you were right, I did.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.271
And maybe it was just jealousy
or lust or...

16:11.304 --> 16:13.173
Well, you can just
listen to that later.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.274
(phone beeps)

16:14.307 --> 16:15.408
(clears throat)

16:15.442 --> 16:17.477
I'm sorry,
I was just trying

16:17.510 --> 16:19.679
to make it better. I just
You don't have
to make it better.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.248
thought that I could help.
PETRA: I don't need
either of you to help.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.683
I'm so sick
of this whole thing.
There's no thing.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.286
No, no thing.
Nothing at all.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.155
I actually have
a date tonight.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.991
So, you're telling me
you're 100% over Rafael?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.297
Well...

16:37.330 --> 16:39.266
100% is a big number.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.800
(scoffs)
Uh, but I don't
want to be with him

16:40.833 --> 16:42.235
and he doesn't want
to be with me, Petra.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.303
He wants to be with you.
Oh.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.504
Jane.
We all know deep down

16:44.537 --> 16:46.106
he'll always still
have feelings for you.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.440
Petra.
Or maybe you don't.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.242
You know what? Who cares?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.278
The point is,
my feelings clicked off

16:51.311 --> 16:53.213
the moment you
believed her over me.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.218
Now can we go home?

16:58.251 --> 17:00.320
(elevator bell dings)

17:00.353 --> 17:03.356
Petra! Finally!
I've been looking for you.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.058
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Whoa, who's the lady

17:05.092 --> 17:06.426
with the crazy eyes?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.361
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Rafael's sister, Luisa.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.363
Well, here I am.
How can I help you?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.338
The voice is great.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.107
Just the right level
of holier-than-thou.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.742
Just clean yourself up.
Petra wouldn't wear sweats.

17:22.775 --> 17:26.746
Well, I-I was
about to change.
Good.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.348
Is it done?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.350
Is Petra in
the storage locker?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.419
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, my God, quick, Petra,

17:32.452 --> 17:33.820
do the accent.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.156
(imitating Anezka):
Yes. Of course.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.158
Petra is in the
storage locker,

17:38.191 --> 17:41.228
just like we planned.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.703
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Everyone
is the hero in their own story.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.305
And Rafael's story?

17:52.339 --> 17:54.441
Well, for the longest time,

17:54.474 --> 17:56.309
it had to do with Jane.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.644
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Wait, what's with

17:57.677 --> 17:58.878
the slow-motion push?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.713
(gasps)
Is what's-her-face, right?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.682
Does he actually
still love her?
(phone ringing)

18:02.715 --> 18:04.851
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Shh!
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Please be Adam.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.355
It's Petra, for you.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.389
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Ugh.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.790
So, we have a problem.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.625
Your sister was going to
put me in a storage unit.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.861
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
It's not the worst idea.
What?

18:14.894 --> 18:17.330
Just long enough for Anezka
to impersonate me

18:17.364 --> 18:18.831
and sign the papers
to sell the Marbella.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.401
But, here's the thing.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.902
She thinks I'm Anezka.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.738
So, I had an idea.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.508
Okay, fine.
What's your idea?

18:28.541 --> 18:31.444
But if it's hiring someone
to put this together,

18:31.478 --> 18:34.147
the answer is no.

18:34.181 --> 18:37.116
Fine. We'll soldier on then.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.757
You know, you do look very manly
holding that hammer.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.393
Oh, yeah?

18:46.426 --> 18:47.527
Mm-hmm.
You like that?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.796
(giggles)

18:49.829 --> 18:51.798
(phone chimes)

18:53.666 --> 18:54.934
(gasps)

18:54.967 --> 18:56.703
Darci's going live
on Instagram.

18:56.736 --> 18:57.704
Maybe don't...

18:57.737 --> 18:58.871
DARCI:
Hi, Factor fans.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.807
It's Darci and boo-boo.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.709
We are coming to you live
from Dr. Ghazali's

19:02.742 --> 19:05.512
where I'm about to see
my sweet girl's face

19:05.545 --> 19:07.814
for the first time in 3D.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.383
She knows I'm supposed
to be there.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.684
Ro, stop.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.686
Don't do anything
rash, okay?

19:13.720 --> 19:17.156
Just call your lawyer and
let him know what's going on.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.961
You're right.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.797
Fine. I'll do that.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.933
Maybe I'll just
take a walk first,

19:26.966 --> 19:29.469
just to cool off a little bit.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.410
Look how much money
I got, Mommy!

19:37.444 --> 19:39.546
What? Where did you
get this from?

19:39.579 --> 19:41.414
My friends.
I just told them we were poor

19:41.448 --> 19:42.682
and they wanted to help.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.787
Stay here.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.689
Mrs. Taub?

19:49.722 --> 19:51.424
Hi there.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.460
Mrs. Conway.
Hello to you, too.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.894
Just wanted to return
some money.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.863
Apparently, Mateo was running
around saying that we're poor

19:56.896 --> 19:58.465
and his friends
wanted to help.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.566
Why would he say that?

19:59.599 --> 20:02.702
Um, honestly,

20:02.735 --> 20:04.437
there-there are some
financial struggles at home.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.738
I guess he picked up on it.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.674
I'll e-mail the parents.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.743
And if you're not going to come
back, you should let us know.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.812
Hmm?
The financial trouble.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.648
Tuition is due in full
by the end of the summer

20:15.682 --> 20:18.751
and we do have a
long waiting list.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.988
Let me get back to you.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.457
There's no way we're going back
to that school.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.459
Honestly,
that was the last straw.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.727
There's no concern, no empathy,

20:27.760 --> 20:29.529
just, "Do you have the money
or not?"

20:29.562 --> 20:30.897
Forget that it was offensive.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.465
But that is just not
the environment

20:32.499 --> 20:33.733
I want Mateo to be in.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.835
I say we take this opportunity
and make a change. And just...

20:35.868 --> 20:37.470
Jane, can we just talk
about this later?

20:37.504 --> 20:38.871
I have a lot on my mind
right now.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.741
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.276
Of course.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.611
Okay. Bye.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.979
XIOMARA: Everything okay
with you two?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.981
Oh, yeah. He's just
stressed. All good.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.683
Trying to get
back to normal.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.685
And I have a date
tonight with Adam.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.622
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes,
speaking of the dashing Adam...

20:55.655 --> 20:57.990
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And a dash
of Adam is all you get.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.727
And you're 100% sure that's
all you want with Rafael,

21:00.760 --> 21:01.894
friendship?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.566
Why is everybody obsessed
with 100%?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.768
I mean, who's 100% sure
about anything?

21:08.801 --> 21:13.840
Look, I told him that I thought
I had feelings for him,

21:13.873 --> 21:16.576
but it was probably just
because I was jealous.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.511
And he didn't respond.
How romantic.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.513
Ma.
Why are you
hedging everything?

21:20.547 --> 21:22.782
Because there is
so much at stake.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.517
We're co-parents

21:24.551 --> 21:26.653
and whatever we do
affects so many people.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.522
And it's not like
he's made any moves.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.791
Maybe you're not paying
attention to the cues.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.527
(phone chimes)

21:34.561 --> 21:38.331
Why is your dad going live
on Instagram?

21:38.365 --> 21:40.667
And since I am the loving father
of this child,

21:40.700 --> 21:42.902
(chuckles)
I have very clear rights.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.772
I am here at the sonogram.

21:45.805 --> 21:50.577
And, Darci, I demand to be
a part of this experience.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.046
(Darci gasps)
(both gasp)

21:54.080 --> 21:56.315
Wow, Dad just put Darci's
vagina on Instagram.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.557
I can't believe you broadcast
my cervix to the entire world.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.925
It was an accident.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.660
And it wasn't
the whole world.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.997
Only 3 million people
watch my feed.

22:11.030 --> 22:15.034
Oh, well, 4.5 million.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.737
Wow. You're getting
a lot of likes.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.839
(laughs)

22:19.872 --> 22:21.774
Why are you laughing?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.810
Because this went better
than I could've imagined.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.613
I knew eventually you
would do something stupid

22:26.646 --> 22:28.581
and violate the terms
of our contract.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.750
Did you read the fine print?

22:30.783 --> 22:35.688
It protects my "reasonable
expectation" of privacy.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.858
I figured my lawyers would
have to build a case slowly,

22:38.891 --> 22:41.127
but revenge porn?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.696
You've outdone yourself.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.632
You were baiting me?

22:45.665 --> 22:49.101
My cervix all over the Internet
is a small price to pay

22:49.135 --> 22:52.872
for a lifetime of not having
you in our child's life.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.089
(exhales)

23:14.026 --> 23:16.663
(phone chimes)

23:42.088 --> 23:44.491
Oh, wow.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.060
I just have,
I have that thing

23:48.094 --> 23:49.662
tonight, that date.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.664
Right.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.132
Stranger danger guy.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.070
(clicks tongue)

23:58.104 --> 23:59.839
You know, let's-let's
just talk later.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.074
Are you sure?

24:02.108 --> 24:04.677
Yeah.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.714
You know, just, um,
enjoy your night.

24:07.747 --> 24:10.950
Oh, boy, Mommy
looks beautiful.
(chuckles)

24:10.983 --> 24:14.721
Yeah. She really does.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.023
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Man, maybe she should

24:17.056 --> 24:18.491
cancel the date with Adam.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.959
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, my God.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.094
You have no idea
what Adam has planned.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.897
Which brings us here,

24:24.931 --> 24:27.734
to the roof of his loft,
a perfect date spot.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.201
Go, Adam.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.203
I thought we could
eat outside.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.772
I cooked.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.106
You cook?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.709
Uh, well, grilled cheese.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.512
One third white cheddar,
one third yellow cheddar,

24:39.546 --> 24:41.881
one third American.
Right?

24:41.914 --> 24:43.716
Mmm.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.152
Come on, I wasn't gonna
mess this up.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.821
Oh, my 19-year-old self
is freaking out right now.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.222
(laughs): Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.892
And, uh, what about
your 28-year-old self?

24:52.925 --> 24:56.128
Well, she's taking everything
in, playing it cool.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.930
Ah.
Mm-hmm.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.732
Well, allow me to show you
my inflatable living room.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.268
Oh.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.270
Do you still play guitar?

25:04.303 --> 25:06.739
Oh, no. No,
that's my roommate's.

25:06.773 --> 25:09.108
And I'm-I'm so sorry for making
you listen to me back then.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.210
It's been brought to
my attention that I suck.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.246
Well, I loved that
one song you wrote.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.048
Do you remember it?

25:16.082 --> 25:18.150
28-year-old Jane
is making me work.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.787
Hmm.

25:26.593 --> 25:29.796
(romantic love cue playing)

25:33.065 --> 25:35.902
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh,
my God, he wrote her love cue?

25:35.935 --> 25:38.537
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
That's his love cue.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.143
Wait, where are we going?

25:44.176 --> 25:46.045
Ugh, are you serious?

25:46.078 --> 25:47.947
You're interrupting the date

25:47.980 --> 25:51.283
for what's-her-face walking
through a hallway with papers?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.586
Please, tell me
you have some good news.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.254
We got an offer
for the hotel.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.157
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR: Wait,
what? They're working together?

25:58.190 --> 26:00.192
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It's Petra
playing Anezka playing Petra.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.094
I told you they do this.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.930
Now, it's 30 million
less than we wanted,

26:03.963 --> 26:05.932
but it's an all-cash offer.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.334
(imitating Anezka): I had
Krishna investigate company

26:08.367 --> 26:09.902
and cash is real.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.137
Here is offer.

26:11.170 --> 26:14.140
30 million under
is a big discount.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.075
But you say
you want all cash.

26:16.108 --> 26:20.379
Why? If you don't mind
me asking you?

26:20.412 --> 26:22.314
Had some expenses that came up.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.216
Oh.
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Expenses? Like what?

26:24.250 --> 26:26.018
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Will you slow your roll?

26:26.052 --> 26:28.855
I was about to flash back to...
(both laughing)

26:28.888 --> 26:30.356
...Luisa and her lover,

26:30.389 --> 26:33.192
the recently jailed crime lord
known as Sin Rostro.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.228
By the way, if I
ever get caught,

26:36.262 --> 26:39.231
I need you to
deposit $100 million

26:39.265 --> 26:41.100
into my account here
in the Caymans.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.003
That'll initiate
my escape protocol.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.037
Mm.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.239
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow, I like these two.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.275
They seem straight
out of a comic book,

26:49.308 --> 26:51.878
which brings us back to...

26:51.911 --> 26:54.380
Oh, yeah.
I totally see it.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.015
(stifled laugh)

26:56.048 --> 26:57.984
ADAM:
Really "yeah"?

26:58.017 --> 27:00.419
Or "yeah" like you used to say
when you couldn't see anything?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.254
I can't see anything.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.091
(laughs) Okay,

27:05.124 --> 27:07.927
we're gonna make this
happen tonight, okay?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.662
Just watch my finger.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.398
You follow the curve
of the Big Dipper.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.366
Takes you down to Arcturus,

27:14.400 --> 27:16.302
and that takes you
right to Spica.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.172
There's Virgo.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.242
Yeah. Okay.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.877
I think.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.378
(stifled laugh) That
is not good enough.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.015
I want 100%.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.417
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, geez.
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Bad choice of words.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.119
Okay, let's try this.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.921
What's the brightest star
you see in the sky?

27:34.954 --> 27:36.889
That one.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.090
ADAM:
Yes. That's Spica.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.225
That's-that's the brightest star

27:39.258 --> 27:40.960
in the Virgo constellation

27:40.993 --> 27:45.031
that you are now most
definitely looking at.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.133
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
See? Adam's got this.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.970
The stars are aligning
for these two.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.972
Wait, why are you
being so quiet?

27:53.005 --> 27:55.007
You always have something
to say.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.176
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, the
stars are definitely aligning.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.246
But...

28:00.279 --> 28:02.181
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, come on.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.382
You've got to be kidding me.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.422
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, where were we?
Ah, stop.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.091
You know exactly where we were.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.126
You okay?

28:16.128 --> 28:17.496
Uh-oh.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.935
Sorry. It's-it's not you.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.070
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Obviously.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.838
Adam's amazing.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.340
I just...
right before I saw you,

28:28.374 --> 28:31.811
I was on my way
to tell my son's father

28:31.844 --> 28:33.813
that I had
feelings for him.
Oh.

28:33.846 --> 28:37.516
And now,
I'm not 100% sure

28:37.549 --> 28:40.019
how he feels...

28:40.052 --> 28:41.453
or how I feel.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.957
Well, you should
take care of that.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.358
I'm really sorry.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.493
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
You should be.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.361
It's all good.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.797
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
No, not all good.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.198
You are making a huge mistake.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.190
Yes!

29:18.224 --> 29:19.959
I found it!

29:19.992 --> 29:22.494
(laughs)
I found it!

29:22.528 --> 29:23.996
(laughs)
Okay.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.865
What's going on, Rogelio?

29:25.898 --> 29:28.534
I asked our editor to send
me all of the raw footage

29:28.567 --> 29:30.837
of the De La Vega
Factor Factor,

29:30.870 --> 29:32.404
and I've been
combing through it,

29:32.438 --> 29:34.073
and look what I found.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.808
Hey, Darci, they're
asking for you.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.009
Darci?

29:37.043 --> 29:38.410
This is just footage
of an adorable puppy.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.846
I don't understand...

29:39.879 --> 29:40.880
(dog whimpers)

29:40.913 --> 29:42.481
Oh, my God!

29:42.514 --> 29:45.017
Darci punched that puppy
in the face!

29:45.051 --> 29:46.585
I know.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.988
In her defense, she was
trying to punch the P.A.,

29:49.021 --> 29:51.057
but America is not
going to know that.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.524
I sent the video to Darci.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.126
Either she abides by
our baby contract

29:54.160 --> 29:56.896
or this goes
directly to TMZ.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.899
Darci Factor:
Puppy Puncher.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.034
(phone chimes)

30:02.068 --> 30:04.837
Oh, here's her reply.

30:04.871 --> 30:07.439
She will honor the contract
and she hates me!

30:07.473 --> 30:10.542
Yes!

30:10.576 --> 30:12.912
What?
Nothing.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.113
Good.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.547
I-I was just thinking

30:15.581 --> 30:17.917
how Jane is being
so careful with Rafael

30:17.950 --> 30:19.518
because he's Mateo's dad,
you know?

30:19.551 --> 30:20.920
Your point?

30:20.953 --> 30:26.592
That puppy puncher,
she's your baby's mom.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.463
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us back

30:31.497 --> 30:32.999
to our careful Jane.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.166
(sighs)

30:59.291 --> 31:03.662
And, friends,
it's safe to say tonight,

31:03.695 --> 31:05.497
a line will be crossed.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.000
(water running)

31:30.289 --> 31:32.591
And maybe it was the picture,

31:32.624 --> 31:35.527
or the wine, or just the fact
that she was tired

31:35.561 --> 31:38.264
of being so damn careful...

31:38.297 --> 31:39.966
Actually, who am I kidding?

31:39.999 --> 31:41.667
It was mostly the wine.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.937
But the point is, Jane thought
about how Adam was right.

31:44.971 --> 31:48.074
(exhales)
Less talking, more action.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.977
*

31:54.346 --> 31:56.949
(shower running)

31:56.983 --> 31:58.150
Hey.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.651
I'm home.
RAFAEL: Hey.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.320
(opens zipper)
Hi.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.328
So, uh...

32:09.361 --> 32:11.363
I know you wanted to talk...

32:11.397 --> 32:14.333
RAFAEL: Yes. About Mateo's
school and his trust fund.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.035
JANE:
Oh.

32:16.068 --> 32:19.571
Right. Okay.
What about it?

32:19.605 --> 32:22.574
Well, I paid next year's tuition
with his trust fund.

32:22.608 --> 32:25.177
I just told you that
I wanted to leave that school.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.013
Because they
made you feel bad

32:27.046 --> 32:28.314
about not being able
to pay tuition--

32:28.347 --> 32:29.581
so I solved that.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.151
But the whole point was that

32:32.184 --> 32:33.752
I didn't want Mateo
going back there.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.322
And long term,
things are gonna have to change.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.258
They won't, though,
'cause I'm making a play
to get the hotel back

32:39.291 --> 32:41.060
right out
from under Luisa.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.761
And the way that
I'm gonna do that

32:42.794 --> 32:45.264
is also with money
from Mateo's trust fund.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.366
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Well, that explains the nerves.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.068
What?
Petra and I are borrowing

32:49.101 --> 32:50.702
from all three kids'
trust funds

32:50.736 --> 32:53.205
to put together an all-cash
offer to buy Luisa's shares.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.640
What are you doing?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.609
Fine. I was gonna get
in the shower,

32:57.643 --> 32:59.211
but I changed my mind.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.280
Ooh, how can you take money
from Mateo's trust fund?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.015
Don't you have
to consult with me?

33:03.049 --> 33:04.516
That's not how it works.
Well, it should.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.286
And what school Mateo goes to,
that does need a consult.
I was just trying

33:07.319 --> 33:09.088
to get things back
to the way they were.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.023
And why were you trying to
get in the shower with me?

33:11.057 --> 33:12.191
Oh, my God.
You have been

33:12.224 --> 33:14.260
sending me all
these mixed signals.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.329
What mixed signals?
Who... leaves out
a glass of wine

33:17.363 --> 33:19.265
with a Post-it saying,
"I'm in the shower"?

33:19.298 --> 33:21.367
Someone who wants you to
relax after a bad date,

33:21.400 --> 33:23.669
and to also know that
he was in the shower.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.371
Well, you should have
written that on the Post-it.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.139
Plus, you left
the bathroom door open.
'Cause your grandma

33:27.173 --> 33:29.641
told me the room gets moldy
when the water runs too long.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.643
Eh, she only said that so you
wouldn't take such long showers.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.112
And you said that
you were glad

33:33.145 --> 33:34.280
that my date with Adam
didn't go well.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.315
Because Alba's been complaining
that this guy's a loser.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.785
I just thought...
What? That the world
revolves around you?

33:39.818 --> 33:42.654
Well, it doesn't.
What is that
supposed to mean?

33:42.688 --> 33:44.656
I had this great thing with
Petra, and you ruined it.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.325
Are you kidding?
I didn't ruin it.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.161
You did, by not believing
the woman that you were dating.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.829
So stop twisting everything!

33:50.862 --> 33:52.731
Everything?
Yes! You knew
I didn't want Mateo

33:52.764 --> 33:54.366
to go to that school
next year.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.135
You know I don't like
those people.

33:56.168 --> 33:59.171
You mean people like me?
I mean people who care
only about money,

33:59.205 --> 34:01.373
who look down on you
if you don't have it.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.343
Oh, my God! I am done feeling
guilty 'cause I don't want Mateo

34:04.376 --> 34:06.378
to have some small life
where he counts pennies

34:06.412 --> 34:08.714
and doesn't get on a plane
till he's 20 years old!

34:08.747 --> 34:12.318
You know, if Mateo grew up
to say something like that,

34:12.351 --> 34:15.154
I would feel like
I failed as a parent.

34:15.187 --> 34:18.457
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I did say they'd cross a line.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.765
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Friends, last night
there was a terrible fight.

34:26.798 --> 34:29.168
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Only because you led me to
believe Rafael was into Jane,

34:29.201 --> 34:32.504
with all the misleading
push-ins and the long glances.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.373
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I was talking about
Jane and Rafael's fight.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.243
And for the last time,
I'm shaping the story.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.211
(shower running)
I'm actually...

34:39.245 --> 34:41.280
glad that we fought,
because now I know

34:41.313 --> 34:44.250
how totally and completely wrong
we are for each other.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.152
And can you
believe that he's

34:46.185 --> 34:48.320
in the shower again?

34:48.354 --> 34:50.156
Who showers this
much? I mean,

34:50.189 --> 34:52.324
he's gonna be the cleanest
homeless man in all of Miami.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.659
Whatever. He'll be
out of here soon.

34:53.692 --> 34:54.726
(knocking on door)

34:56.428 --> 34:58.530
Delivery for Rafael Solano.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.732

Uh... what is it?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.170
All of his belongings,
courtesy of Luisa Alver.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.675
What the hell?

35:09.708 --> 35:11.310
JANE:
Your stuff.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.511
Oh, my God.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.280
I am so sorry.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.283
Look, this-this will all
be dealt with later... today.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.717
(rapid chiming)

35:18.750 --> 35:21.587
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

35:21.620 --> 35:23.555
Luisa wants
to meet Anezka

35:23.589 --> 35:25.391
in an hour to sign
the paperwork.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.659
Tell me there's
not a problem.
I'm not here

35:27.693 --> 35:29.295
because of the Marbella.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.697
Got my iPad back.

35:31.730 --> 35:35.467
And my phone texts
were backed up.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.706
Anezka didn't lure you
to the dock

35:40.739 --> 35:42.741
with a business emergency.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.744
Which means that your feelings
didn't just shut off

35:45.777 --> 35:50.349
when I believed Jane over you,
which leads me to believe, or...

35:50.382 --> 35:52.318
hope...

35:52.351 --> 35:53.685
maybe that...

35:53.719 --> 35:56.522
there's still a chance
for you and me.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.791
I don't know, I mean...

36:01.460 --> 36:03.429
W-We don't work together.

36:03.462 --> 36:06.332
But things will be
different now-- we'll...

36:06.365 --> 36:07.566
communicate.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.701
And I'll listen and trust you.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.637
Because you were right.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.739
I was all caught up
in Jane's...

36:13.772 --> 36:15.774
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Story.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.477
...stuff, but I'm not anymore.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.613
And I can tell you, 100%,

36:21.647 --> 36:24.283
that I-I don't want
to be with Jane.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.654
I want to be with you.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.358
*

36:43.302 --> 36:45.537
I'll call you
after I get our hotel back.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.439

See?

36:47.473 --> 36:50.476
Everyone's a hero.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.578
Your dad's sorry
he couldn't come over,

36:52.611 --> 36:55.247
but he's embarking
on an act of heroism

36:55.281 --> 36:57.616
for the sake
of his unborn daughter.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.286
His words, obviously.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.490
He went to see Darci,

37:04.523 --> 37:06.258
and he's gonna try
and make peace.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.659
Ah.
Well, I think that's great.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.262
I know. Isn't it?

37:10.296 --> 37:11.430
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

37:11.463 --> 37:14.366
I'm really so happy.

Ma?

37:18.304 --> 37:19.805
I'm sorry...

37:19.838 --> 37:22.741
I... I think I just...

37:22.774 --> 37:24.843
never want to be sad
around Rogelio,

37:24.876 --> 37:26.645
you know, because...

37:26.678 --> 37:29.348
he's having a baby.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.583
And that's a beautiful thing.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.385
He's not here.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.820
What's going on?

37:34.853 --> 37:36.555
It just sucks, you know?

37:36.588 --> 37:39.391
Because I'm supposed to be
in Honolulu right now,

37:39.425 --> 37:41.893
sucking down mai tais
and having honeymoon sex,

37:41.927 --> 37:44.530
not chasing after sonograms

37:44.563 --> 37:46.898
and getting
into Twitter wars.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.567
Yeah, that totally sucks.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.336
Right?
Sí.

37:50.369 --> 37:53.305
I guess I just want to feel
a little sorry for myself.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.841
That's totally okay.
I feel sorry for you.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.644
Well, thanks.
And I feel sorry for you, too.

37:58.677 --> 37:59.911
Really?
Yeah. I mean,

37:59.945 --> 38:01.847
the whole shower thing?
(laughs)

38:01.880 --> 38:03.749
Oh. Right, that, too.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.352
I thought you meant
because I re-met my first love

38:06.385 --> 38:08.787
in the most magical way,
and he said all the things

38:08.820 --> 38:11.323
my 19-year-old self
just always hoped he would,

38:11.357 --> 38:13.459
and I screwed it all up.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.626
Aw.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.428
When you put it that way...

38:26.805 --> 38:28.874
We can't.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.614
Mm-hmm.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.852
So you've said.

38:42.788 --> 38:43.955
Hmm.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.368
Oh, my God!

I'm sorry, but there was no way
you were getting married.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.472

39:23.695 --> 39:24.796
And what are you
doing here?

39:24.830 --> 39:26.632
I already said
I'd honor the contract.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.999
I know, I know.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.902
But I want you to want
to honor the contract.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.604
What the hell
are you talking about?

39:32.638 --> 39:34.406
Our relationship, Darci.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.475
You're the mother
of my child.

39:36.508 --> 39:37.776
I want us to get along.

So I promise,

39:39.811 --> 39:41.613
I will never insult you again.

39:41.647 --> 39:42.881
Oh, yeah?

39:42.914 --> 39:44.550
Well, I don't think
you're handsome.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.918
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.554
You're a horrible actor.

39:48.587 --> 39:52.424
Well, art is very s-subjective.

You are the worst lover

No, no. I promise.

Okay, Darci, I know
you're upset,

40:08.540 --> 40:10.776
but you don't have
to do all this.

with the other guy?

40:26.692 --> 40:27.726
Yeah, I did.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.595
Good.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.630
Um...

40:31.663 --> 40:33.865
you want to get
some coffee sometime?

40:33.899 --> 40:35.934
I'd really like that.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.737
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
And, friends, that's how Adam

40:38.770 --> 40:40.906
got back together with Jane.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.843
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What are you doing?

40:44.876 --> 40:46.812
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
This is how we end things.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.747
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well,
we still have stuff to do.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.482
And he's part of our story now.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.950
LATINA LOVER NARRATOR:
Ugh. Let me guess--

40:51.983 --> 40:53.552
more blondie signing papers?

40:53.585 --> 40:54.853
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yes.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.955
And thank you
for that transition.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.526
(imitating Anezka): So,
I forged Petra's signature.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.594
Now you sign and hotel is sold.

41:02.628 --> 41:03.729
Perfect.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.597
Hmm. And...

41:05.631 --> 41:07.599
just to clarify--

41:07.633 --> 41:09.901
you are Anezka, right?

41:11.069 --> 41:12.938
Yes.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.073
Then who's this?

41:18.944 --> 41:21.813
Hello, beautiful sister.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.052
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hello, ugly mister.

41:27.085 --> 41:30.622
Does anyone besides
you know him?

41:30.656 --> 41:32.824
No. Just me.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.661
And I'll take the secret
to my grave.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.664
Hmm. Yes, you will.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.065
(grunts)

41:40.098 --> 41:43.068
(grunting, choking)

41:43.101 --> 41:45.537
(alarm blaring)
GUARD: Step back.

41:45.571 --> 41:49.007
Just add another 70 years
to my life sentence.

41:51.777 --> 41:54.279
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Now, that's how we end things.
