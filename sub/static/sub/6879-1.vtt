01:08:00.344 --> 01:08:01.411
Play you for what?

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:03.513
You want Turk off your back,
I can do that for you.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:04.814
What the fuck are you
talking about?

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:08.818
You win, I'll take the fall.
I win...

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:11.321
You won't win.

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:14.258
The least you can do

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:18.194
Is play me one final
fucking game of cards.

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:27.171
Take this fuck upstairs.
Come on.

01:08:33.877 --> 01:08:36.845
Pino, hold a gun on him.
You, sit here.

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:41.185
Bruno, deal.
20 chips each, no limit.

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:43.587
Sure.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:46.656
Cocky fuck, aren't you?

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:48.692
Got it from my dad.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.595
At least that's what
my mom tells me.

01:08:53.397 --> 01:08:55.198
She really didn't like you.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.700
Couldn't figure
out why till now.

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:57.567
What are you talking about?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.468
I mean, I know she
fucking hated you

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:01.505
'Cause you fucked
my dad over, but...

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:04.341
There's something else,
right?

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:06.643
Something I'm missing.

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.212
You don't know
what you're saying.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.247
I know you loved her.

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:12.849
I know you couldn't stand
the fact

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.451
That my dad
was happy with her.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.785
You shut your fucking mouth!

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.520
Am I wrong?

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.224
You didn't fuck him over

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.826
Because she picked him
over you?

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:25.761
Huh? Even with all
your fucking money,

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:27.464
She picked a loser.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.600
She picked a fucking loser,
Chips.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.937
Maybe you don't care.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.906
You don't care
that she's dead now.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.707
That's right.

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:41.377
She couldn't get the medical
attention she needed,

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:45.715
'Cause Turk's men didn't let
the nurse come into our home.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:50.520
Since you sent Turk
after Ben and me,

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:53.256
She's dead because of you.

01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:58.895
She's dead?

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.398
I didn't send Turk
after you!

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:12.742
You made a bad bet, Chips.
I'm all in.

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:16.413
That wasn't supposed
to happen.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:20.484
What did she say?
Did she say anything?

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:23.887
You wanna know what she said?
You go all in too.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:25.555
And you get Turk's money

01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:26.990
And you put that
on the fucking table!

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:28.792
Shut the fuck up.
You're not in charge here.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.827
Where is it?
It's in the safe?

01:10:31.461 --> 01:10:33.297
And that's where
it's gonna stay.

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:34.631
Deal a card.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:38.402
[Dramatic music]

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:42.005
*

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.581
I win.

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:54.851
Straight beats two pair,
Chips.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:03.527
Don't matter no more.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:09.466
[Gunshots]

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:10.700
[Groaning]

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.638
You all right?

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.608
[Chips sputtering]

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:20.677
My mom's not dead,
asshole.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.447
It's called bluffing.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:25.849
Bobby...

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.785
You wanna finish him off?

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:34.458
[Gunshot]

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:39.529
Money's in the office.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.004
Here.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.039
It's all here, man.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:51.875
All the money.

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:54.944
I'm still so fucking mad
about that fucking tear gas.

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:57.981
My lung have been
burning ever since.

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:01.485
Not to mention the kids'
nightmares.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.053
I should kill you
for that.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:07.524
And then I was thinkin'
you're not such a bad kid.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:13.062
You got some smarts,
some creativity.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.532
Maybe I should just
let you go

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:18.668
Knowing I'm out there,
waiting for you.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.772
I could just kill you
whenever you want.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:24.574
Turk, look, I don't know
what you're getting at,

01:12:24.608 --> 01:12:25.575
But I-I...

01:12:25.609 --> 01:12:28.478
I just don't know
if I can trust you, Bobby.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:33.850
And where would be
without trust?

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:37.787
You know you can
trust me, right?

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.490
Meh.

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:43.560
Freeze!
Hands off your weapon!

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:45.128
[Gunshots]

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:46.796
Aah!

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.632
[Bobby breathing heavily]

01:12:50.500 --> 01:13:01.545
[Police sirens]

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:10.654
Oh my God, Bobby!

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.722
Hey.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:15.124
Are you okay?

01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:18.828
What happened?

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:20.830
It's over.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.866
That's all that matters.

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:32.476
What did you say
when you called?

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.612
I saw these men
go in with guns.

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.482
My boyfriend's in there.
Please, you have to help him.

01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:39.916
I heard gunshots.

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:40.984
Okay.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:43.152
All right, I guess
you're better than I thought.

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:45.722
Your mom gonna be okay?

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:51.761
I missed you.

01:13:55.499 --> 01:13:58.935
[Birds chirping]

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:08.945
