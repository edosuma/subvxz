08:44.167 --> 08:46.233
of a child.

Hey, hey, Bunny!

08:47.200 --> 08:47.900
Get on over here

08:47.900 --> 08:48.467
and get on the floor

08:48.467 --> 08:49.067
and let Trip ride you

08:49.067 --> 08:51.067

08:51.067 --> 08:53.300
>> Sounds good.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.633
>> Come on, I'm too old

09:49.200 --> 09:50.867
is demonstrating,

09:50.867 --> 09:52.133
the goal of Sky Whale

09:52.133 --> 09:53.200
is to keep the narwhal

09:53.200 --> 09:55.067
up in the sky flying.

09:55.067 --> 09:56.267
>> Right, and to do that,

09:56.267 --> 09:56.833
he needs energy.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.333
>> Which he gets

09:58.333 --> 10:00.167
from eating the donuts.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.300
>> And to boost him up higher,

10:01.300 --> 10:02.067
you just bounce him

10:02.067 --> 10:02.767
off the clouds.

10:02.767 --> 10:03.833
>> Any questions?

10:03.833 --> 10:04.667

10:31.567 --> 10:32.167
was to use technology

10:32.167 --> 10:34.267
in a way that helps humanity.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.700
