WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:05.035
- ( birds chirping)
-( bugs chittering )

00:09.217 --> 00:11.299
Boy: Mom!

00:11.469 --> 00:13.380
Right here.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.934
( pots rattling )

00:26.568 --> 00:28.183
Any luck?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.816
How do we tell if they're poison?

00:32.866 --> 00:36.324
Uh, there's only
one sure way I know of.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.244
Ask Shane when he gets back?

00:40.415 --> 00:41.905
Yeah, you've got it.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.414
Thank you.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.458
Dale, I'm heading out.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.338
Sweetheart, I want you to stay
where Dale can see you, okay?

00:51.509 --> 00:53.090
Yes, Mom.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.343
Dale: You too.
Don't wander too far.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.923
Stay within shouting distance.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.760
And if you see anything, holler.
I'll come running.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.799
( softly )
Yes, Mom.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.055
( bugs chittering )

01:29.631 --> 01:31.622
( leaves rustle )

01:35.762 --> 01:37.423
( bird wings flap)

02:08.545 --> 02:10.501
-( branch snaps)
-(gaspS)

02:10.672 --> 02:12.663
(wings flap )

02:16.302 --> 02:19.135
( branches snapping )

02:31.901 --> 02:33.562
- ( gasps )
-( panting )

02:36.781 --> 02:39.067
Shh shh shh
shh shh shh shh.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.200
- ( chuckles )
- You scared the hell out of me.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.487
I bet. That's what you get
for keeping me waiting.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.996
l was trying to be quiet.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.203
- Where you been?
- Amy the mushroom queen--

02:49.377 --> 02:51.493
I had to wait
for her to get back.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.842
- How much time we have?
-Enough.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.396
( moans)

03:42.388 --> 03:44.845
( both moaning )

03:53.691 --> 03:55.556
- Come here.
- Okay.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.271
( both grunting )

04:03.910 --> 04:06.492
(theme music playing )

04:44.575 --> 04:47.408
(zombies growling, moaning)

04:56.087 --> 04:57.873
-( radio beeping, hissing)
-( pounding)

04:59.674 --> 05:01.084
Man on radio:
Hey, are you alive in there?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.624
(thuds, grunts)

05:03.970 --> 05:06.586
- Hello? Hello?
- ( man sighs ) There you are.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.345
You had me wondering.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.926
Where are you? Outside?

05:10.101 --> 05:11.557
Can you see me right now?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.764
Man:
Yeah, I can see you.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.554
You're surrounded by walkers.
That's the bad news.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.473
There's good news?

05:18.651 --> 05:21.313
- Man: No.
- Listen, whoever you are,

05:21.487 --> 05:23.944
I don't mind telling you
I'm a little concerned in here.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.573
Man: Oh man.
You should see it from over here.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.110
You'd be having a major freak-out.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.620
Got any advice for me?

05:32.790 --> 05:36.123
Man:
Yeah, I'd say make a run for it.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.128
That's it? "Make a run for it"?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.834
Man: My way's not
as dumb as it sounds.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.873
You've got eyes
on the outside here.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.509
There's one geek still up on the tank
but the others have climbed down

05:46.679 --> 05:48.795
and joined the feeding frenzy
where the horse went down.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.679
- With me so far?
- So far.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.466
Okay, the street on the other side
of the tank is less crowded.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.056
If you move now while they're
distracted, you stand a chance.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.221
- You got ammo?
- In that duffel bag

05:58.399 --> 06:00.355
I dropped out there,
and guns. Can I get to it?

06:00.526 --> 06:02.858
Man: Forget the bag, okay?
It's not an option.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.361
- What do you have on you?
- Hang on.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.195
( gun clicks, clatters )

06:23.174 --> 06:26.291
Yeah. Yeah.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.960
I've got a Beretta with one clip,

06:29.138 --> 06:31.880
- 15 rounds.
- Make 'em count.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.674
Jump off the right side of the tank,
keep going in that direction.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.229
There's an alley up the street,
maybe 50 yards.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.137
Be there.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.306
Hey, what's your name?

06:41.484 --> 06:44.146
Have you been listening?
You're running out of time.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.560
Right.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.942
( breathing heavily )

06:52.412 --> 06:53.902
(growling)

06:54.997 --> 06:56.737
( groans )

07:01.712 --> 07:04.203
- Ah!
- ( zombies moaning)

07:04.382 --> 07:05.792
( gunshots)

07:16.310 --> 07:17.846
Whoa! Not dead!

07:18.020 --> 07:19.396
Come on! Come on!

07:19.564 --> 07:21.304
Back here!

07:22.358 --> 07:24.974
Come on! Come on!

07:26.779 --> 07:28.280
(gunshot)

07:30.283 --> 07:32.274
What are you doing?! Come on!

07:37.165 --> 07:39.281
(growling)

07:43.629 --> 07:45.290
Come on, get up.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.956
( both panting )

07:56.476 --> 07:58.637
Nice moves there,
Clint Eastwood.

08:02.106 --> 08:05.143
- It wasn't my intention.
- Yeah, whatever. Yeehaw.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.934
You're still a dumbass.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.819
Rick. Thanks.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.152
Glenn. You're welcome.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.821
Oh no.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.328
(growling)

08:24.462 --> 08:25.998
The bright side:

08:26.172 --> 08:28.163
it'll be the fall that kills us.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.878
I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.131
Rick: Are you the one
that barricaded the alley?

08:39.310 --> 08:42.347
Somebody did--
I guess when the city got overrun.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.229
Whoever did it was thinking
not many geeks would get through.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.390
Back at the tank, why'd you stick
your neck out for me?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.775
Call it foolish, naive hope

08:49.946 --> 08:52.062
that if I'm ever
that far up Shit Creek,

08:52.240 --> 08:53.605
somebody might
do the same for me.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.365
Guess I'm an even bigger
dumbass than you.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.336
I'm back. Got a guest
plus four geeks in the alley.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.014
(zombies growling )

09:32.488 --> 09:34.399
- Glenn: Let's go!
- ( men grunting)

09:36.325 --> 09:37.781
Man:
Morales, let's go!

09:41.080 --> 09:42.741
Woman: You son of a bitch.
We ought to kill you.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.873
- Just chill out, Andrea. Back off.
- Come on, ease up.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.374
Andrea: Ease up?
You're kidding me, right?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.706
We're dead because
of this stupid asshole.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.498
Andrea, I said
back the hell off.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.050
Or pull the trigger.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.855
We're dead-- all of us--

10:07.940 --> 10:09.771
because of you.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.023
I don't understand.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.108
Look, we came into the city
to scavenge supplies.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.365
You know what the key
to scavenging is? Surviving!

10:19.535 --> 10:22.322
You know the key to surviving?
Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.452
Not shooting up the streets
like it's the OK. Corral.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.161
Every geek for miles around
heard you popping off rounds.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.417
You just rang the dinner bell.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.418
Morales:
Get the picture now?

10:31.589 --> 10:33.671
(growling)

10:38.471 --> 10:40.462
Andrea: Oh God.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.977
What the hell were you
doing out there anyway?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.478
Trying to flag the helicopter.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.389
Man: Helicopter?
Man, that's crap.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.103
- There ain't no damn helicopter.
- Woman: You were chasing

10:53.277 --> 10:54.653
a hallucination,
imagining things. It happens.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.151
I saw it.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.114
Morales: Hey, T-Dog, try that CB.
Can you contact the others?

11:00.284 --> 11:02.366
Others? The refugee center?

11:02.536 --> 11:05.278
Yeah, the refugee center. They've got
biscuits waiting at the oven for us.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.539
Got no signal.
Maybe the roof.

11:08.709 --> 11:12.042
- ( gun firing)
- Oh no. Was that Dixon?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.670
- Woman: What is that maniac doing?
- Morales: Come on, let's go.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.877
(gun firing)

11:31.732 --> 11:34.769
- Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?!
-( Dixon laughing)

11:35.945 --> 11:37.981
- ( gun fires)
- Andrea: Oh jeez.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.864
Huh? Hey! You ought to be
more polite to a man with a gun!

11:42.034 --> 11:44.366
Huh? Ah!

11:44.537 --> 11:46.198
Only common sense.
( laughing )

11:46.372 --> 11:48.704
Man, you wasting bullets
we ain't even got, man!

11:48.874 --> 11:51.365
And you're bringing even more of them
down on our ass! Man, just chill.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.035
Hey, bad enough I've got
this taco-bender on my ass all day.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.044
Now I'm gonna
take orders from you?

11:56.215 --> 11:59.252
I don't think so, bro.
That'll be the day.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.258
"That'll be the day"?
You got something

12:01.429 --> 12:03.636
- you want to tell me?
- Hey, T-Dog man, just leave it.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.171
- No.
- All right? It ain't worth it.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.341
Now, Merle, just relax, okay?

12:08.519 --> 12:10.350
We've got enough trouble.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.853
- Merle: You want to know the day?
- Yeah.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.641
I'll tell you the day, Mr. "Yo."
It's the day I take orders

12:16.819 --> 12:17.979
- from a nigger.
- Mother--

12:18.154 --> 12:19.940
Morales:
Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.695
- Andrea: Okay, come on. Come on.
- ( all shouting)

12:21.866 --> 12:23.902
Andrea: Dixon! Dixon!

12:24.076 --> 12:25.407
Morales:
Whoa, cut it out, man!

12:25.578 --> 12:28.695
Andrea: Stop it!
Dixon, come on! Get off him!

12:28.873 --> 12:30.158
Dixon, you're gonna hurt him.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.873
Morales:
Merle, cut it out!

12:36.046 --> 12:38.537
(grunts)

12:44.054 --> 12:46.136
No no no, please. Please.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.757
(thunder rumbling)

12:49.935 --> 12:52.893
( T-Dog grunting )

13:02.531 --> 13:04.237
- ( yells)
- ( grunts)

13:04.408 --> 13:07.195
Yeah! All right!

13:07.369 --> 13:10.577
We're gonna have ourselves
a little powwow, huh?

13:10.748 --> 13:14.206
Talk about who's in charge.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.118
| vote me. Anybody else?

13:17.296 --> 13:20.129
Huh? Democracy time, y'all.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.631
Show of hands, huh?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.509
All in favor? Huh?

13:25.679 --> 13:28.056
Come on. Let's see 'em.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.259
Andrea:
Oh, come on.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.139
All in favor?

13:31.310 --> 13:34.643
Yeah. That's good.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.102
Yeah, that means
I'm the boss, right?

13:38.275 --> 13:41.483
Yeah. Anybody else?

13:41.654 --> 13:44.441
- Hmm? Anybody?
- Rick: Yeah.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.108
(grunting)

13:55.167 --> 13:57.829
- Who the hell are you, man?!
- Officer Friendly.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.168
Look here, Merle.
Things are different now.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.254
There are no niggers anymore.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.386
No dumb-as-shit,
inbred white-trash fools either.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.014
Only dark meat
and white meat.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.845
There's us and the dead.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.805
We survive this
by pulling together,

14:15.980 --> 14:18.687
- not apart.
- Screw you, man.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.569
I can see you make a habit
of missing the point.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.068
Yeah? Well, screw you twice.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.275
Ought to be polite
to a man with a gun.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.155
Only common sense.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.533
You wouldn't. You're a cop.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.542
All lam anymore

14:37.710 --> 14:40.042
is a man looking
for his wife and son.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.295
Anybody gets in the way
of that is gonna lose.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.712
I'll give you a moment
to think about that.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.387
( Pats )

14:58.230 --> 15:00.221
Got some on your nose there.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.515
What are you gonna do?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.149
Arrest me?
( laughs )

15:04.320 --> 15:07.153
Hey! Dude, what are you doing?
Man, that's my stuff!

15:07.323 --> 15:09.405
Hey! (grunts)

15:09.575 --> 15:11.486
If I get loose,
you'd better pray--

15:11.660 --> 15:14.367
yeah, you hear me, you pig?!

15:14.538 --> 15:16.369
- You hear me?!
- Yeah, your voice carries.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.622
Merle:
You hear me, you filthy pig?!

15:20.586 --> 15:23.328
You're not Atlanta P.D.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.915
- Where you from?
- Up the road a ways.

15:28.093 --> 15:32.757
( chuckles ) Well, Officer Friendly
from up the road a ways,

15:32.932 --> 15:36.424
- welcome to the big city.
- ( thunder rumbling)

15:36.602 --> 15:39.765
(zombies moaning )

15:46.862 --> 15:48.944
God, it's like
Times Square down there.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.278
- Morales: How's that signal?
- T-Dog: Like Dixon's brain-- weak.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.069
Morales:
Keep trying.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.702
Andrea:
Why? There's nothing they can do.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.329
Not a damn thing.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.786
Got some people
outside the city is all.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.168
There's no refugee center.
That's a pipe dream.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.169
Rick: Then she's right.
We're on our own.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.500
It's up to us to find a way out.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.040
Merle:
Good luck with that.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.960
These streets ain't safe in this part
of town from what I hear.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.174
Ain't that right, sugar tits?

16:15.349 --> 16:17.465
Hey,honeybunch,

16:17.643 --> 16:19.258
what say you get me
out of these cuffs,

16:19.436 --> 16:22.519
we go off somewhere
and bump some uglies?

16:22.690 --> 16:26.148
- Gonna die anyway.
- I'd rather.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.811
Rug muncher.
I figured as much.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.901
"The streets ain't safe."

16:33.075 --> 16:34.656
Now there's an understatement.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.489
What about under the streets?
The sewers?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.574
Morales: Oh man.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.659
Hey, Glenn, check the alley.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.495
You see any manhole covers?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.496
- ( growling)
- ( thunder rumbling)

16:52.219 --> 16:55.336
No, must be all out on the street
where the geeks are.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.551
Maybe not. Old building like this
built in the '20s--

16:58.726 --> 17:01.513
big structures often had
drainage tunnels into the sewers

17:01.687 --> 17:03.928
in case of flooding
down in the subbasements.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.688
- Glenn: How do you know that?
- It's my job-- was.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.565
I worked in the city zoning office.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.867
Morales:
This is it? Are you sure?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.829
Glenn: I really scoped this place
out the other times l was here.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.039
It's the only thing
in the building that goes down.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.590
But I've never gone down it.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.215
Who'd want to, right?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.552
Oh. Great.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.430
- We'll be right behind you.
- No, you won't. Not you.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.641
Why not me? Think I can't?

17:46.815 --> 17:48.646
I wasn't--

17:48.817 --> 17:50.398
Speak your mind.

17:52.321 --> 17:56.439
Look, until now
| always came here by myself--

17:56.617 --> 17:59.074
in and out, grab a few things--
no problem.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.735
The first time I bring a group--
everything goes to hell.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.700
No offense.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.367
If you want me to go down
this gnarly hole, fine--

18:09.421 --> 18:11.662
but only if we do it my way.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.582
It's tight down there. If! run into
something and have to get out quick,

18:14.760 --> 18:16.921
I don't want you all jammed up
behind me getting me killed.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.426
I'll take one person--
not you either.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.807
You've got Merle's gun
and I've seen you shoot.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.717
I'd feel better
if you were out in that store

18:25.896 --> 18:27.932
watching those doors,
covering our ass.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.268
You've got the only other gun,
so you should go with him.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.400
You be my wingman.
Jacqui stays here.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.435
Something happens,
yell down to us,

18:35.614 --> 18:37.024
- get us back up here in a hurry.
- Okay.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.282
Okay, everybody knows theirjobs.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.874
(water splashing )

18:54.299 --> 18:56.290
( rats squeaking )

19:20.826 --> 19:22.657
-( rat squeals )
- Dah!

19:32.504 --> 19:32.538
(zombies banging, growling)

19:32.546 --> 19:34.502
(zombies banging, growling)

19:47.227 --> 19:49.218
Sorry for the gun in your face.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.641
People do things
when they're afraid.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.977
Not that it was entirely unjustified.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.859
You did get us into this.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.021
If I get us out,
would that make up for it?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.566
No. But it'd be a start.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.372
Next time though,
take the safety off.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.051
It won't shoot otherwise.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.298
- Oh.
- Is that your gun?

20:24.473 --> 20:26.429
It was a gift. Why?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.811
Little red dot means
it's ready to fire.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.313
You may have occasion to use it.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.067
Good to know.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.240
- T-Dog: Anybody out there?
- ( thunder rumbling)

20:48.580 --> 20:51.196
Hello? Anybody read?

20:51.375 --> 20:52.706
I'm hoping to hear
somebody's voice,

20:52.876 --> 20:54.582
'cause I'm getting sick
and tired of hearing mine.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.039
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.079
Why don't you knock
that crap off?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.794
You're giving me
a headache, boy.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.459
Why don't you pull
your head out of your ass?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.298
Maybe your headache
will go away.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.214
- ( Merle chuckles )
- Try some positivity for a change.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.054
- Damn.
- I'll tell you what--

21:11.228 --> 21:12.559
you get me out of these cuffs

21:12.729 --> 21:15.436
and I'll be all "Sammy Sunshine"
positive for you.

21:16.733 --> 21:21.102
Hey, see that hacksaw
over there in that toolbag?

21:22.656 --> 21:26.444
Get it for me, hmm?
Make it worth your while.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.199
What do you say, man?
Come on.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.110
Get me out of these things.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.325
So you can beat my ass again?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.790
Or call me nigger some more?

21:35.961 --> 21:38.293
Come on now. It wasn't personal.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.296
It's just that your kind
and my kind ain't meant to mix.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.502
That's all.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.293
It don't mean we can't...
work together,

21:46.471 --> 21:49.554
parley, as long as there's
some kind of mutual gain involved.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.099
So... about that hacksaw--

21:56.273 --> 21:58.184
I guess you want me to get
that rifle over there too

21:58.358 --> 22:00.735
so you can shoot that cop
when he comes back up, huh?

22:03.739 --> 22:06.822
- Huh.
- ( door clangs)

22:08.285 --> 22:10.571
( rats squeaking )

22:16.126 --> 22:19.334
Morales: Yeah, we've got
ourselves a sewer tunnel.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.165
Jacqui was right.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.956
Can we cut through it?

22:24.134 --> 22:26.841
Morales: If we had
a blowtorch and half a day, sure.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.799
Dale's hacksaw sure
as hell won't do it.

22:29.973 --> 22:32.350
-( rats squeaking )
- ( crunching)

22:34.436 --> 22:35.767
(growling)

22:41.777 --> 22:44.189
(zombies banging, growling)

22:44.363 --> 22:46.069
Andrea: Mmm.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.951
See something you like?

22:53.121 --> 22:56.534
Not me, but I know
someone who would--

22:58.043 --> 23:00.034
my sister.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.544
She's still such a kid
in some ways.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.454
Unicorns, dragons--

23:04.633 --> 23:06.294
she's into all that stuff.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.629
But mermaids-- they rule.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.386
She loves mermaids.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.137
Why not take it?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.349
There's a cop staring at me.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.010
( chuckles )

23:21.108 --> 23:23.064
Would it be considered looting?

23:25.487 --> 23:28.570
I don't think those rules
apply anymore. Do you?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.195
( glass shatters )

23:46.716 --> 23:48.707
- What did you find down there?
- Not a way out.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.755
We need to find a way...

23:51.930 --> 23:53.545
SOOI‘I.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.934
(thunder rumbling)

24:01.648 --> 24:04.731
That construction site, those trucks--
they always keep keys on hand.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.148
Morales: You'll never
make it past the walkers.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.573
You got me out of that tank.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.117
Yeah, but they were feeding.
They were distracted.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.616
Rick:
Can we distract them again?

24:14.786 --> 24:16.993
Merle: Right. Listen to him.
He's onto something.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.496
A diversion,
like on "Hogan's Heroes."

24:19.666 --> 24:22.578
- God. Give it a rest.
- They're drawn by sound, right?

24:22.752 --> 24:25.789
Right, like dogs.
They hear a sound, they come.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.670
- Rick: What else?
- Aside from they hear you?

24:27.841 --> 24:30.423
They see you, smell you
and if they catch you, they eat you.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.461
- They can tell us by smell?
- Glenn: Can't you?

24:33.638 --> 24:36.254
They smell dead, we don't.
It's pretty distinct.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.935
If bad ideas
were an Olympic event,

24:43.106 --> 24:44.812
- this would take the gold.
- He's right.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.019
Just stop, okay?
Take some time to think this through.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.526
How much time? They already
got through one set of doors,

24:49.696 --> 24:51.197
that glass won't hold forever.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.239
(zombies growling )

25:09.174 --> 25:11.415
(sighs)

25:47.921 --> 25:49.832
Wayne Dunlap.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.042
Georgia license.

25:52.217 --> 25:56.210
Born in 1979.

26:00.725 --> 26:04.138
He had $28 in his pocket
when he died...

26:05.939 --> 26:07.930
and a picture of a pretty girl.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.649
"With love, from Rachel."

26:15.740 --> 26:17.025
He used to be like us--

26:17.200 --> 26:19.282
worrying about bills

26:19.452 --> 26:22.910
or the rent or the Super Bowl.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.788
If I ever find my family,
I'm gonna tell them about Wayne.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.177
Glenn:
One more thing--

26:40.599 --> 26:42.760
he was an organ donor.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.306
- ( grunts)
- Oh!

26:47.480 --> 26:49.971
- Madre de Dios!
- ( chopping )

26:51.109 --> 26:53.646
Glenn:
Oh! God...

26:53.820 --> 26:55.185
damn it!

26:55.363 --> 26:58.196
- Oh God.
- Andrea: Oh.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.233
- ( all groan )
- Morales: Dios!

27:01.411 --> 27:03.026
Oh God.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.333
(all groaning)

27:11.796 --> 27:14.287
( groans )

27:16.509 --> 27:18.545
Keep chopping.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.301
(Glenn groaning)

27:21.848 --> 27:24.555
- I am so gonna hurl.
- Later.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.481
Andrea: Oh!

27:38.865 --> 27:40.730
Everybody got gloves?

27:42.702 --> 27:45.159
Don't get any on your skin
or in your eyes.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.492
(all groaning)

28:13.483 --> 28:15.314
Glenn:
Oh God!

28:15.485 --> 28:18.352
Oh jeez.
Oh, this is bad.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.986
This is really bad.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.487
Think about something else--

28:21.658 --> 28:23.068
puppies and kittens.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.279
Dead puppies and kittens.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.616
(vomiting )

28:28.790 --> 28:31.247
That is just evil.
What is wrong with you?

28:31.418 --> 28:33.750
Next time let
the cracker beat his ass.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.333
- T-Dog: I'm sorry, yo.
- Glenn: You suck!

28:40.885 --> 28:44.048
- Do we smell like them?
- Oh yeah.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.891
Just in case.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.234
If we make it back, be ready.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.191
What about Merle Dixon?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.831
Rick:
Give me the axe.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.790
- We nee-- we need more guts.
- Andrea: Oh God!

29:21.968 --> 29:23.299
( door creaks)

29:25.597 --> 29:27.588
(zombies moaning )

29:48.203 --> 29:50.194
(growling)

30:29.828 --> 30:31.819
(zombies groaning )

31:13.705 --> 31:15.036
Merle:
Hey, what's happening, man?

31:15.206 --> 31:17.322
Morales:
Hey, T-Dog, try that CB.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.115
Merle: Hey, come on.
Talk to me, y'all.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.206
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

31:22.380 --> 31:24.416
Can anybody out there hear me?

31:26.342 --> 31:28.958
- There.
- ( thunder rumbling)

31:29.137 --> 31:32.174
That asshole is out on the street
with the handcuff keys?

31:43.067 --> 31:47.060
Boy, that hose isn't long
for this world, is it?

31:48.156 --> 31:49.521
Man: No sir.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.566
Dale: Where the hell are
we gonna find a replacement?

31:53.870 --> 31:55.861
It's late. They should've
been back by now.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.200
Worrying won't make it better.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.207
- Shane: Attaboy.
- Carl: Yeah.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.247
Shane:
And three, two, one-- pull it.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.417
- Carl: Ah!
-( both laugh )

32:11.846 --> 32:13.802
Shane:
Start it over.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.469
Make your "P" the other way--
around your finger.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.932
- Oops.
- Good, just tie it around your finger.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.604
Attaboy.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.811
-( radio squawking )
- T-Dog: Hello, base camp!

32:27.320 --> 32:29.652
Can anybody out there hear me?

32:33.451 --> 32:36.284
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me?

32:36.454 --> 32:38.160
Hello? Hello?

32:38.331 --> 32:39.946
Reception's bad on this end.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.116
- Repeat. Repeat.
- Shane, is that you?

32:43.294 --> 32:44.670
Is that them?

32:44.837 --> 32:46.668
- ( static )
- T-Dog: We're in some deep shit.

32:46.839 --> 32:49.751
We're trapped in
the department store.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.462
He say they're trapped?

32:51.636 --> 32:53.217
T-Dog: There are geeks
all over the place. Hundreds of 'em.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.299
We're surrounded.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.464
T-Dog, repeat that last. Repeat.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.634
( static )

33:04.816 --> 33:06.977
- ( radio stops )
- He said the department store.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.561
Dale:
I heard it too.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.899
- Lori: Shane?
- No way.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.654
We do not go after them.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.531
We do not risk
the rest of the group.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.239
- Y'all know that.
- So we're just gonna leave her there?

33:18.413 --> 33:21.826
Look, Amy, I know that
this is not easy--

33:22.000 --> 33:23.331
She volunteered to go

33:23.501 --> 33:25.002
to help the rest of us.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.660
I know, and she knew
the risks, right?

33:27.839 --> 33:31.002
See, if she's trapped, she's gone.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.091
So we just have to
deal with that.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.589
There's nothing we can do.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.723
She's my sister,
you son of a bitch.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.817
- ( thunder rumbling)
- Lori: Amy...

33:58.661 --> 34:00.197
Come on.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.531
(moaning)

34:53.174 --> 34:56.541
( whispers )
It's gonna work. I can't believe it.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.927
( whispers )
Don't draw attention.

Oh man.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.667
(thunder crashes)

35:50.314 --> 35:51.815
It's just a cloudburst.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.395
We get 'em all the time.
lt'll pass real quick.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.112
(growling)

36:25.141 --> 36:27.678
The smell's washing off. Isn't it?

36:27.852 --> 36:29.592
- Is it washing off?
- No, it's not.

36:33.024 --> 36:36.061
- Well, maybe.
- ( roars )

36:38.279 --> 36:39.519
Oh shit! Run!

36:39.697 --> 36:42.313

36:52.793 --> 36:54.829
Come on, come on, come on.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.190
( gunshots)

37:25.076 --> 37:26.532
Rick!

37:40.299 --> 37:42.290
(engine starts)

37:42.468 --> 37:43.708
Go go go go!

37:43.886 --> 37:45.217
( tires screech )

38:05.241 --> 38:06.276
They're leaving us.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.485
- No. No no no no no.
- Dixon: What? What? What do you mean?

38:07.660 --> 38:09.946
- Where they going? Where they going?
- No no, come back.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.120
Oh God. Oh God.
They're all over that place!

38:17.295 --> 38:18.455
You need to draw them away.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.415
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store--

38:20.589 --> 38:22.090
that area?
--that's what I need cleared.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.091
Raise your friends. Tell them
to get down there and be ready.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.843
And I'm drawing the geeks away how?
|-- I missed that part.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.504
Noise.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.673
( car alarm blaring )

38:43.988 --> 38:45.979
(engine rewing)

38:47.658 --> 38:49.865
( tires screech )

39:02.089 --> 39:03.920
Those roll-up doors
at the front of the store

39:04.091 --> 39:05.877
facing the street--
meet us there and be ready.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.425
( alarm continues )

39:21.108 --> 39:23.770
- Morales: Come on! Let's go, let's go!
- Hey, you can't leave me here!

Hey, T-Dog. No, man.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.460
You can't leave me here--

39:40.628 --> 39:42.243
You can't, man. It's not human.

39:42.421 --> 39:44.798
- Come on, don't do this.
- ( groans)

39:44.965 --> 39:46.830
Come on, T. Come on!
