Ohh, you forgot the staples.

Oh, we truly are the main office

Oh, no.

It's a coffee pot.
Is that not coffee in there?

- Oh, is there not coffee?

00:51.033 --> 00:53.467
- Actually, Ders, don't you mean
flat Dr Pepper pot?

00:53.467 --> 00:58.400
Because we put flat Dr Pepper
in a coffee pot and switched it.

Muzzle--although that's a good

write your age on that card

15:26.333 --> 15:27.733
- Yeah, I think it's safe to say
that we're in.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.867
In fact, we're down
for a clap back.

15:29.867 --> 15:31.367
both: Clap back.
- Yep.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.167
We've got to do something,
because they broke

15:33.167 --> 15:35.100
our number one rule.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.767
You don't snitch, not to Alice,
not to HR, not to the police.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.067
- Yeah, yeah.
- Don't snitch.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.333
I guess the main office
pranksters

15:41.333 --> 15:43.167
will get to work then.

15:43.167 --> 15:46.700
You guys sit back, relax, and
we're about to clap back.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.267
- No, thank you, okay?

15:48.267 --> 15:51.233
We've seen how y'all prank.

15:51.233 --> 15:53.267
We're gonna handle the pranking.
We got this.

15:53.267 --> 15:55.900
- Okay, wow.
Okay, you're in charge.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.867
Please let us know if we can
assist you, Your Highness.

15:58.867 --> 16:01.167
Seriously, though,
if we could just help,

16:01.167 --> 16:02.900
we're pretty bored and have
nothing to do.

16:02.900 --> 16:03.967
- Sup?

16:03.967 --> 16:05.633
You guys have a good week off?

16:05.633 --> 16:08.400
You chill, hit the ol' internal
reset button?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.967
[laughter]

16:09.967 --> 16:12.133
- Yeah, no, it was very chill.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.100
A week with no pay.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.733
I didn't even get to visit
the ice cream truck.

16:16.733 --> 16:20.100
- Wait, you guys--you guys
aren't pissed, are you?

16:20.100 --> 16:22.500
- You know, it's just that we
don't usually involve Alice

16:22.500 --> 16:24.467
in pranks is all, so, you know.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.067
- You guys inspired us.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.733
You're our heroes.
We're you biggest Stans.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.267
- That's cool.

16:29.267 --> 16:31.067
- I have always considered
myself a Slim Shady.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.833
- Yes.
- And I plan on talking about

16:32.833 --> 16:35.067
murdering my wife but not
actually doing it.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.667
- Kim sucks.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.667
- Yeah, dude, and on the
lowdown, it was hella rad of you

16:38.667 --> 16:41.900
guys to stay true to yourselves
inside and not snitch.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.100
I mean, you guys are like the
super-old wise dogs

16:44.100 --> 16:45.900
our pack always needed.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.967
- Right, right, but, like,
the oldest of the young dogs.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.467
Yeah, no, I get that.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.433
You know, we're still pups on
the porch,

16:51.433 --> 16:53.067
even though we like to run
around in the yard.

16:53.067 --> 16:56.733
- Yeah.
- But since we're all pups here,

16:56.733 --> 16:59.267
I've got to tell you that
everyone in this office

16:59.267 --> 17:03.400
wants to fi-ight you, and
they're planning a prank...

17:03.400 --> 17:04.667
clap back.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.967
- Yep.
- But the thing is,

17:05.967 --> 17:07.733
is, we really li-ike you.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.333
- And we don't want to fi-ight
you.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.067
- We li-ike you too.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.367
- So if you let us QB this
prank,

17:13.367 --> 17:15.867
new school and newer school
working together...

17:15.867 --> 17:17.667
- Yes.
- I think we could prank

17:17.667 --> 17:19.233
the office before
they prank you.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.567
- Yeah.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.900
- We appreciate you guys
li-iking us,

17:22.900 --> 17:25.667
and we don't want to fi-ight
anybody at all.

17:25.667 --> 17:28.200
If you guys don't mind, yeah,
we'll let you take the lead

17:28.200 --> 17:30.433
on the clap back.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.733
- Yo, what up, world?
It's us.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.967
The main office pranksters
in conjunction with...

17:54.967 --> 17:56.633

17:56.633 --> 17:59.167

ultimate main office prank

17:59.167 --> 18:01.067
in da world.

18:01.067 --> 18:04.367
- That's right, so we got LSD,
MDMA, and Special K

18:04.367 --> 18:06.800

it's a clap back.

in here?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.233

18:19.233 --> 18:21.300
a different alternate
universe.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.300
- [groaning]

18:23.300 --> 18:26.467
- I'm losing my mind.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.367
I'm seeing demons.

18:28.367 --> 18:32.133
No. No!

18:32.133 --> 18:34.233
- That is not good.
That is not good at all.

18:34.233 --> 18:37.100
- My eyes!
I can't see!

18:37.100 --> 18:39.867
- My heart is about to pop!

18:39.867 --> 18:40.967
Oh!

18:40.967 --> 18:42.067
- [mumbling indistinctly]

18:42.067 --> 18:43.133
- Jerry, what's poppin'?

18:43.133 --> 18:44.600

18:44.600 --> 18:46.400
- Jerry.
- Oh, shit!

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
- What's popping, Jerry?

18:47.400 --> 18:48.700
- No.
- Oh.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.200
Yo, they're, like, OD'ing.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.067
- Their old hearts couldn't
handle it, guys.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.267
- We could--we could go to jail
for this.

18:53.267 --> 18:54.567
- Yep.
- What do you mean, "yep"?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.300
- Hey, no, don't worry about it.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.967
That's on us, okay?
You guys should get out of here.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.433
You got your whole lives ahead
of you, right?

18:59.433 --> 19:01.067
So just run. Get out of here.

19:01.067 --> 19:03.067
Because sometimes clap backs
clap back.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.667
- I mean, this is on us.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.767
- We appreciate everything
you taught us, old dog.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.767
- I'm not an old--okay,
I'm not old, though.

19:08.767 --> 19:10.433
- Yo, man, you all guys are
heroes, man.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.833
- You may think this is
good-bye, but this is great-bye.

19:12.833 --> 19:15.600
You'll live in my heart forever.
- Just go. Just go. Just go.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.367
- Get outta here.
I liked you the least.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.867
- Just go.
- Oh, my gosh.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.767
You guys did such a great job,
and I'm proud of you!

19:23.767 --> 19:25.633
- Waymond, come on up.

19:25.633 --> 19:27.167
- Wow, I'm impressed.
- Feelin' good! Shake it off!

19:27.167 --> 19:28.700
- You feel like you've lost
some weight.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.600
- Good acting.
That was really good stuff.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.933
You guys are officially the JV
main office pranksters.

19:33.933 --> 19:36.367
- Seriously.
- Hey, how are we the JV?

19:36.367 --> 19:38.500
That was my idea.
- Yeah, but you guys are like

19:38.500 --> 19:40.167
the nerd losers of the office;
we're cool.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.667
- You weren't in charge.
That's why it worked.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.967
- Uh, hold on.
I think 69 Man's taking a nap.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.500
Hey, bud.
- Oh, yeah. Come on.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.500
- Prank's over.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.200
He's a ham.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.933
- Yeah.
- 69 Man.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.633
- That's varsity material.

19:53.633 --> 19:54.967
- 69 Man.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.100
- Hey, 69 Man.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.500
- Come on, get up.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.133
- 69 Man.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.300
69 Man.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.467
- 69 Man.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.833

Ahh!

20:05.833 --> 20:08.600
[The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"]

20:12.533 --> 20:17.400
- And even though
we hardly knew him,

20:17.400 --> 20:20.133
never really knew his real name,

20:20.133 --> 20:22.333
it was still pretty awesome

20:22.333 --> 20:25.467
that he let us call him
the 69 Man.

20:25.467 --> 20:28.467
- He was old.

20:28.467 --> 20:32.067
But knew that 69

20:32.067 --> 20:34.500
was a cool
sexual maneuver.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.700
- So in mem--memori--

20:38.700 --> 20:41.533
mem--
memoriam-dum,

20:41.533 --> 20:44.467
we got his favorite sandwich,

20:44.467 --> 20:46.867
an Italian Trio
from Jersey Mike's...

20:46.867 --> 20:48.300
we're assuming;
we don't know the guy,

20:48.300 --> 20:49.567
but that's our favorite
sandwich, so...

20:49.567 --> 20:51.567
- Think he would have
liked that.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.400
- This is supposed to be
Italian Trio party sub.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.233
This is roast beef.
They made a mistake.

20:57.233 --> 20:58.667
- Are you sure...

20:58.667 --> 21:00.700
that someone didn't switch it on
purpose?

21:00.700 --> 21:02.933
[laughter]

21:02.933 --> 21:06.067
- You just got pranked, dude,
and what is that?

21:06.067 --> 21:08.100
[together]
A clap back.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.067
- Nice.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.367
- That's a man?
- Yeah, look at those calves.

21:16.367 --> 21:17.700
- I guess there's no way
to tell, really.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.467
- No.
- Eh, well, what about the--

21:19.467 --> 21:22.433
the moustache right there?

21:22.433 --> 21:24.300
- You're in Rancho Cucamonga.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.133
- Oh, okay, so that's natural.
- Yeah.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.700
- Okay, got it.
- They grow 'em thick out here.
