WEBVTT

00:31.300 --> 00:33.033
(CLICKING PEN RAPIDLY)

00:34.367 --> 00:36.167
I don't give shitty jobs.

00:36.234 --> 00:39.901
If a good man comes to me

00:39.968 --> 00:41.400
and says, "Thank you, David,

00:41.467 --> 00:43.934
"for the opportunity and continued support

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
"in the work-related arena,

00:46.067 --> 00:48.000
"but I've done that, I want to better myself, I want to move on."

00:48.067 --> 00:53.801
Then, I can make that dream come true to, AKA, for you.

00:53.868 --> 00:56.734
The point is you talk the talk, but do not walk the walk,

00:56.801 --> 01:00.400
vis-a-vis you've not yet passed your forklift driver's test.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.434
The man who gives the jobs in the warehouse

01:02.500 --> 01:05.634
is a personal friend of mine. All right?

01:05.701 --> 01:07.834
I know you're the man for the job. (SNIFFS)

01:09.234 --> 01:11.901
Sammy, you old slag.

01:11.968 --> 01:13.968
It's the Brentmeister general.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.601
Have you advertised the forklift driver's job?

01:16.667 --> 01:20.467
No? Good. Don't bother. I've got the man here. He's perfick.

01:20.534 --> 01:22.300
Has he passed his forklift driver's test?

01:22.367 --> 01:23.434
He gives the tests.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.801
Yeah, yeah. He's first-aid trained, yeah.

01:30.534 --> 01:33.734
Yeah. We'll get a CV over to you this afternoon.

01:35.734 --> 01:39.200
I'm seeing you Sunday, aren't I? For my sins.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.934
How is Elaine? She left you yet?

01:42.033 --> 01:43.234
Yeah.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.567
All right. See you then.

01:46.968 --> 01:48.868
She has left him. I forgot about that.

01:51.801 --> 01:52.801
(PHONE RINGS)

01:52.868 --> 01:54.634
David Brent.

01:54.701 --> 01:58.300
I've been in the business for 12 years.

01:58.367 --> 02:01.200
Been at Wernham Hogg as General Manager for eight of those.

02:01.467 --> 02:03.400
So, putting together my team.

02:06.133 --> 02:07.667
Lovely Dawn.

02:07.734 --> 02:11.634
Dawn Tinsley. Receptionist. Huh?

02:11.701 --> 02:13.834
-Been with us for ages, haven't you? -Yeah.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.300
I'd say, uh, at one time or another,

02:16.367 --> 02:18.868
every bloke in the office has woken up at the crack of Dawn! (LAUGHS)

02:18.934 --> 02:20.334
What?

02:23.234 --> 02:25.000
Can I have the mail, please?

02:25.067 --> 02:26.734
Yeah.

02:26.801 --> 02:28.601
Just a fax.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.567
Oh.

02:30.634 --> 02:32.434
-Dawn, this is from Head Office. -I know.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.234
How many times have I told you?

02:34.300 --> 02:35.667
There's a special filing cabinet for things from Head Office.

02:35.734 --> 02:38.000
-You haven't told me... -Called the wastepaper basket!

02:38.067 --> 02:39.801
-Your face. -Ah.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.033
Can I get that back?

02:41.100 --> 02:42.834
People say I'm the best boss.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.100
They go, "Oh, we've never worked in a place like this before.

02:45.167 --> 02:48.234
"You're such a laugh. You get the best out of us." And I go,

02:48.300 --> 02:51.434
you know, "C'est la vie. If that's true, excellent."

02:54.033 --> 02:57.467
-Be, uh, be gentle with me today, Dawn. -Yeah. Why is that?

02:57.534 --> 02:59.801
Oh, God, I had a skinful last night.

02:59.868 --> 03:03.734
I was out with Finchy, Chris Finch. Had us on a pub crawl.

03:03.801 --> 03:05.934
El vino did flow.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.868
I was blar...tered.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.601
Bladdered.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.400
Blottoed.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.367
Oh, don't ever come out with me and Finchy.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.100
-No, I won't. -Oh.

03:15.167 --> 03:16.300
You got to go for it.

03:16.367 --> 03:20.033
There's guys my age and they look 50.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.701
How old do you think I look?

03:21.767 --> 03:24.567
-Thirty-si... -Thirty, yeah. Yeah.

03:24.634 --> 03:27.467
About that. But I'm going to have to slow down.

03:27.534 --> 03:29.500
Drinking a bit too much.

03:29.567 --> 03:32.100
If every single night of the week's too much.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.033
(LAUGHS) And every lunchtime!

03:39.601 --> 03:41.234
-How many have I had this week? -What?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.868
How many pints have I drunk this week, if you're counting?

03:43.934 --> 03:45.400
-I'm not counting. -Aren't you?

03:45.467 --> 03:48.000
Hmm, you seem to know a lot about my drinking.

03:48.067 --> 03:50.801
Does it offend you, huh?

03:50.868 --> 03:54.367
You know, getting a little bit, little bit personal.

03:54.434 --> 03:57.667
Imagine if I started doing that with you.

03:57.734 --> 04:00.434
I could look at you and come out with something really witty and biting like,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.868
"You're a bit..." (WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)

04:02.934 --> 04:06.367
But, I don't, because I'm a professional.

04:06.434 --> 04:09.200
And professionalism is...

04:09.267 --> 04:12.100
And that is what I want, okay? That's all.

04:15.234 --> 04:16.400
That's a shame.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.667
-Wassup? -Don't do that!

04:30.033 --> 04:32.334
Jesus! That wasn't funny before.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.601
All right. What is it, your time of the month?

04:35.667 --> 04:38.667
Just the eight pints for me last night, then.

04:38.734 --> 04:39.868
That's all.

04:40.634 --> 04:41.767
Uh!

04:45.801 --> 04:48.667
Oh, no. Oh, God.

04:48.734 --> 04:53.133
"Boss and team leader in drunken night out shock horror," it says here.

04:56.634 --> 04:58.500
It's not like I'm out again tonight with Oggy.

04:58.567 --> 05:01.968
That'll be a quiet night in at the library. Not!

05:03.300 --> 05:05.500
I don't think.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.601
Uh, I'm a sales rep, which means that my job

05:08.667 --> 05:10.534
is to speak to clients on the phone

05:10.601 --> 05:14.300
about, uh, quantity and type of paper,

05:14.367 --> 05:16.300
and whether we can supply it with them,

05:16.367 --> 05:19.701
and whether they can pay for it.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.000
And I'm boring myself talking about it. It's just...

05:27.033 --> 05:28.033
Wassup?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.601
Hey, wassup? I love that.

05:30.234 --> 05:32.267
-Wassup? -Oh.

05:32.334 --> 05:35.167
You're fired, Keenan. Drunkard. (LAUGHS)

05:35.234 --> 05:37.334
Hypocrite warning.

05:38.901 --> 05:40.601
Oh, God.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.167
Oh, what's he been saying?

05:42.234 --> 05:44.868
It's all true. Guilty as charged.

05:44.934 --> 05:47.834
Oh, yeah, Went out with a few of his mates, didn't we?

05:47.901 --> 05:50.567
And, uh, he goes, "Well, tag along if you want,

05:50.634 --> 05:53.400
"but I must warn you, David, they do get a bit rowdy after a few pints."

05:53.467 --> 05:56.567
I went, "I'll see if I can stand it." Right? I was worse than them by the end!

05:56.634 --> 05:58.200
(LAUGHS)

05:58.267 --> 06:00.200
They're going, "Who's that nutter?" "That's my boss."

06:00.267 --> 06:02.167
"We can't stand it any more, we're going." They just left, didn't they?

06:02.234 --> 06:03.367
I told you.

06:03.434 --> 06:06.968
Oh, God. Absolutely mental. Oh!

06:08.701 --> 06:10.667
Resolve! (LAUGHS)

06:13.100 --> 06:14.467
What?

06:15.267 --> 06:16.534
Nothing.

06:20.234 --> 06:22.167
-See you later. -See you later.

06:22.234 --> 06:23.400
Take care.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.367
Listen, would you mind giving Maintenance a call?

06:30.434 --> 06:33.334
There's a nasty smell in the lift.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.500
DAVID: Head Office don't really interfere with me at all.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.868
Uh, Jennifer might come down once a week.

06:38.934 --> 06:42.901
Jennifer Taylor-Clark. We call her Camilla Parker-Bowles.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.934
Not to her face. Well, I mean, not 'cause I'm scared of her.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.667
I got them off Nobby Burton who comes round with a suitcase.

06:49.734 --> 06:51.868
"Two for a tenner." "Yes, please, four."

06:51.934 --> 06:53.734
-So... -DAWN: Hmm.

06:53.801 --> 06:57.934
Okay. Meeting with Jennifer Taylor-Clarke present. Mmm.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.601
-Right. -Shoot.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.234
Was there anything that you wanted to add to the agenda?

07:01.300 --> 07:02.934
Did no get an agenda.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.567
-Sorry? -Did not get an agenda, no.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.133
I did fax you one this morning.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.267
Don't think we got a fax, did we, Dawn?

07:09.334 --> 07:10.567
Yeah, we may have.

07:10.634 --> 07:13.200
Then why isn't it in my hand?

07:13.267 --> 07:17.267
Because a company runs on efficiency of communication.

07:17.334 --> 07:21.200
You, um, put it in the bin that was a special filing cabinet.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.567
As a joke, yeah.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.334
It's not even my joke, it's my brother's joke.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.167
It's meant to be with bills. Doesn't really work with faxes.

07:26.234 --> 07:29.634
-Do you want to have a look at mine? -Yeah.

07:29.701 --> 07:33.033
Yeah, sure, she'd say she's the boss, yeah, but...

07:33.100 --> 07:37.934
There should be no ego when you're pulling together

07:38.000 --> 07:40.701
to do something good. Yeah?

07:40.767 --> 07:43.367
It's like Comic Relief.

07:43.434 --> 07:47.167
Yeah? I'm out here in Africa,

07:47.234 --> 07:48.968
and I'm seeing the flies and the starvation.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.067
And she, if she is the boss,

07:51.133 --> 07:54.467
she's in the studio with, you know, Jonathan Ross and Lenny Henry,

07:54.534 --> 07:55.801
and they've got their suits on. They're doing their bit,

07:55.868 --> 07:57.567
they're counting the money. Good luck to them.

07:57.634 --> 08:00.934
But their hands are clean, while I'm down here in the office

08:01.000 --> 08:03.300
with little starving kids.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.968
-Yeah. -Right (CLEARS THROAT).

08:05.033 --> 08:07.968
Since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided

08:08.033 --> 08:10.767
that we can't justify a Swindon branch and a Slough branch.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.267
-Oh! Okay, go on. -No, now listen, David. Don't panic.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.167
DAVID: Should be good. This is it. Go on.

08:15.234 --> 08:17.434
-There are alarm bells. -No, listen to me. No, don't panic.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.634
-We haven't made any deci... -Don't panic?

08:19.701 --> 08:21.367
-We haven't made any decisions yet. -Good.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.133
I've spoken to Neil in Swindon.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.267
-I've told him the same as you. -Yeah.

08:25.334 --> 08:27.167
And it's up to either you or him

08:27.234 --> 08:29.968
to convince me that your branch could incorporate the other.

08:30.033 --> 08:32.734
-Okay. No problem. -This does, however, mean

08:32.801 --> 08:34.300
that there are going to be redundancies.

08:34.367 --> 08:37.500
Oh, you see? Did I no want to hear that, Jenny,

08:37.567 --> 08:40.367
because redundancies are a tragedy, always.

08:40.434 --> 08:43.000
I wouldn't wish that on Neil's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men...

08:43.067 --> 08:44.934
Or women.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.367
Present company excepted. Is Neil concerned about redundancies?

08:47.434 --> 08:49.000
Well, he is. Of course, yes.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.100
Good. Because I'm very concerned about redundancies.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.300
Although I understand if they're absolutely necessary, as a businessman.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.701
-Does he understand...? Go on. -David.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.267
-Can we not talk about redundancies? -Well...

08:57.334 --> 08:59.467
-What we have to decide... -We have to, sooner or later.

08:59.534 --> 09:01.734
Yes, but at the moment, what we have to decide

09:01.801 --> 09:06.067
is do you take on Swindon's people at this branch or the other way round?

09:06.133 --> 09:07.133
Yeah, we'll take on theirs.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.334
-(LAUGHS) No. -No?

09:08.400 --> 09:10.601
-No. You and I don't decide. -Decide?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.534
-I decide. -You do decide, but...

09:12.601 --> 09:14.567
-Once you've made your case. -Based on factors.

09:14.634 --> 09:16.167
Okay. Is there a time limit on...

09:16.234 --> 09:18.734
-(PHONE RINGS) -Let it go onto answering machine.

09:18.801 --> 09:20.467
DAVID: Hi, mate. Not around at the moment,

09:20.534 --> 09:22.601
so please leave a massage.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.834
(BLEEP)

09:24.901 --> 09:26.267
-All right, Dave, it's the Finch. -Chris Finch. Bloody good rep.

09:26.334 --> 09:27.434
Hear you got a hangover, you big poof.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
Ah, that's derogatory. That's a shame.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.968
You're in with that Jennifer what's-her-face, today, aren't you?

09:32.033 --> 09:33.701
-Give her one for me, son. -Ah.

09:33.767 --> 09:36.000
-Cheers, big ears. -Awful. Awful man.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.267
And stop looking up her skirt.

09:37.334 --> 09:38.667
-David? -I wasn't.

09:38.734 --> 09:40.500
Can we keep a lid on this for the time being?

09:40.567 --> 09:42.968
I really don't want to worry people unduly.

09:43.033 --> 09:46.634
No. Under this regime, Jenny, this will not leave the office.

09:46.701 --> 09:49.200
So, what does redundancy actually mean?

09:49.267 --> 09:51.367
So you'd just go, would you?

09:51.434 --> 09:55.267
-Would you? -Well, I don't know.

09:55.334 --> 09:57.767
Keith and Jamie, they're having these...

09:57.834 --> 10:00.234
-I know. They're all going mad. -...clandestine little chats,

10:00.300 --> 10:01.400
I actually don't give a monkey's.

10:01.467 --> 10:02.534
"Oh God, we're gonna be out of work."

10:02.601 --> 10:03.701
-Do you? -I couldn't give a shit.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.834
This is Mr Brent.

10:16.901 --> 10:18.334
-Guilty. -All right, hi.

10:19.767 --> 10:21.667
Ricky Howard from the temping agency.

10:21.734 --> 10:23.234
-Verna sent me down to start today. -Yeah.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.767
Temporary...

10:25.667 --> 10:27.167
Staff only.

10:27.834 --> 10:28.868
-Ricky? -Yeah.

10:28.934 --> 10:30.868
"Ricky!" (LAUGHS)

10:31.133 --> 10:34.534
"Ricky. No, Ricky!" What was his girlfriend's name on EastEnders?

10:34.601 --> 10:38.033
-Bianca. -"Ricky! Leave it!"

10:38.100 --> 10:39.334
Did she tell you I was mad?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.701
Yeah, she said you had a nervous breakdown.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.367
I haven't had a nervous breakdown, so...

10:42.434 --> 10:44.067
-No. That was a joke. -Yeah?

10:44.133 --> 10:45.968
She said you were a really good laugh and, you know...

10:46.033 --> 10:48.701
-Wow. We all are, aren't we? -Sorry, tried to...

10:48.767 --> 10:50.968
Part of my job description, though, innit?

10:51.033 --> 10:52.400
Unofficially.

10:52.467 --> 10:53.834
Okay. Let's get you started.

10:53.901 --> 10:55.067
-Okay. -Into the fray!

10:55.133 --> 10:56.234
All right.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.367
What upsets me about the job? Um...

11:00.467 --> 11:03.667
Wasted talent, yeah?

11:03.734 --> 11:05.868
People could come to me and they could go,

11:05.934 --> 11:09.033
"Excuse me, David, but you've been in the business 12 years.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.334
"Can you just spare us a moment to tell us how to run a team,

11:12.400 --> 11:15.300
"how to keep them task-orientated as well as happy?"

11:16.234 --> 11:18.000
But they don't.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.567
That's the tragedy.

11:20.634 --> 11:23.801
This is the, uh, Accounts Department.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.767
All right?

11:27.667 --> 11:29.067
The number bods.

11:29.133 --> 11:32.434
Do not be fooled by their job descriptions.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.868
They are absolutely mad, all of them.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.367
Especially that one. He's mental.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.767
Not literally, obviously. That wouldn't work.

11:43.834 --> 11:48.167
Last place you'd want someone like that is in Accounts.

11:48.234 --> 11:51.367
-This is the recycling bin. -Right.

11:51.434 --> 11:53.000
Obviously we get through a lot of paper.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.000
-Mmm-hmm. -We make a lot!

11:55.067 --> 11:56.801
-Actually, we sell it. -Yeah.

11:56.868 --> 11:59.100
-It doesn't grow on trees! -(LAUGHS)

11:59.167 --> 12:00.767
-You know... -Yeah, it is pulp, yeah.

12:01.801 --> 12:03.601
Here.

12:03.667 --> 12:06.534
Mr Davis, can I just call you back? Something's just come up.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.801
Two minutes. Thanks very much. Bye.

12:08.868 --> 12:10.200
What are you doing?

12:10.267 --> 12:12.000
-What? -Gareth, what are you doing?

12:12.067 --> 12:13.567
I'm just pushing this stuff off my desk. I can't concentrate.

12:13.634 --> 12:16.334
-It wasn't on your desk. -It was, it was all overlapping.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.567
It's all coming over the edge here.

12:18.634 --> 12:21.934
All right? One word, two syllables. Demarcation. All right?

12:23.033 --> 12:25.334
David Brent, I presume!

12:25.400 --> 12:28.934
That's just to cheer these lot up.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.767
Send them out to get the plants, the girls,

12:30.834 --> 12:32.634
it makes them a little bit happier.

12:32.701 --> 12:35.300
'Cause they can sometimes get a little bit...

12:39.267 --> 12:40.834
Uh, it's run out of batteries.

12:40.901 --> 12:42.467
Do you want to get some batteries for Billy Bigmouth?

12:42.534 --> 12:45.234
-Take it out of petty cash. -All right.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.701
Can't put a price on comedy. Uh...

12:48.767 --> 12:51.167
You're a twat, Gareth. You're a twat and a knob-end.

12:51.234 --> 12:53.234
I'm still not listening, so it's not offending me.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.734
TIM: Right. Okay. So you won't hear this.

12:54.801 --> 12:57.667
(SINGSONG) You're a cock, you're a cock, you're a cock.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.734
You're a cock.

12:59.801 --> 13:01.334
Here you are, look.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.567
This is the sort of work we're doing.

13:03.634 --> 13:04.601
Cartoons.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.434
"Does my bum look big in these?"

13:08.500 --> 13:11.200
It's not sexist. That's the bloke saying it.

13:11.267 --> 13:13.367
At last. So...

13:13.434 --> 13:15.868
All for that. All for that in the workplace.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.734
Managed to scrape a first in the end.

13:28.133 --> 13:29.968
You've met Tim, haven't you?

13:30.033 --> 13:31.500
-How you doing? -All right.

13:31.567 --> 13:35.434
Oh, careful. Watch this one. Gareth Keenan in the area!

13:35.500 --> 13:38.000
-Ricky, the new temp. -Introduce yourself.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.901
Gareth Keenan, Assistant Regional Manager.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.767
Assistant to the Regional Manager. Gareth's my right-hand man.

13:42.834 --> 13:46.033
Immediately beneath me, oh, as an actress said to a bishop!

13:46.100 --> 13:48.801
No, he's not. I'm not.

13:48.868 --> 13:50.834
Tell him about your car and your kung fu and everything.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.868
Yeah. I've got a TR3.

13:52.934 --> 13:55.901
I bought it for 1,200, done it up, now it's worth three grand.

13:56.167 --> 13:59.367
-The profit on that's just under... -New suspension. New engine.

13:59.434 --> 14:01.901
-Just a wreck. -I've got some photos.

14:01.968 --> 14:03.334
Oh, what is that?

14:03.400 --> 14:05.200
-Whoa, whoa. -David. Right, that is it.

14:05.267 --> 14:07.634
Slow down, you move too fast. Solomon's here.

14:07.701 --> 14:09.367
All part of the job. What's going on?

14:09.434 --> 14:11.901
He put my stapler inside a jelly again.

14:11.968 --> 14:14.400
That's the third time he's done it. It wasn't even funny the first time.

14:14.467 --> 14:15.834
Why has he done that?

14:15.901 --> 14:18.133
I told him once that I don't like jelly.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.167
I don't trust the way it moves.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.300
You showed him a weakness, he pounced. You should know about that.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.167
Uh. What is in here?

14:25.234 --> 14:26.601
It's my stapler.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.734
Well, don't do that! Eat it out.

14:28.801 --> 14:33.067
There's people starving in the world, which I hate. So... And it's a waste.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.500
How do you know it's yours?

14:34.567 --> 14:36.367
'Cause it's got my name on it in Tippex.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.801
Yeah. Don't eat it now, then. Chemicals.

14:38.868 --> 14:41.434
Right. You can be my witness. Give him an official warning.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.234
-How do you know it was me? -It's always you.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.934
-Mad here. -Can't you discipline him?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.634
Ooh, kinky!

14:47.701 --> 14:48.834
(LAUGHS)

14:50.734 --> 14:52.434
No. The thing about practical jokes,

14:52.500 --> 14:54.567
you've got to know when to stop as well as start,

14:54.634 --> 14:57.467
and now's the time to stop putting Gareth's personal possessions in jelly.

14:57.534 --> 14:59.801
Gareth, it's only a trifling matter.

14:59.868 --> 15:01.367
(LAUGHS)

15:01.434 --> 15:03.234
Here we go. We're always like this.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.968
You should both put him in custard-y!

15:06.033 --> 15:08.000
He's going to fit in here. We're like Vic and Bob, aren't we?

15:08.067 --> 15:10.567
And one extra one. Oh, God.

15:10.634 --> 15:14.200
Yeah. I'm more worried really about damage to company property, that's all.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.367
Trifling.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.133
I'm just trying to think of other desserts to do.

15:25.067 --> 15:26.834
Yeah, it's all right here,

15:26.901 --> 15:30.968
but people do sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed.

15:31.033 --> 15:34.100
I like to have a laugh just as much as the next man,

15:34.167 --> 15:36.734
but this is a place of work.

15:36.801 --> 15:38.767
I was in the Territorial Army for three years,

15:38.834 --> 15:40.334
and you can't muck about there.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.000
That's sort of one of the rules.

15:45.767 --> 15:47.334
Hey, dude.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.567
-Give it back. -I'm just using it for a second.

15:49.634 --> 15:51.801
It's got my name on it. Gareth.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.834
-It says "Garet", actually, but... -Ask if you want to borrow it.

15:54.901 --> 15:56.367
You always say no, mate. What's the point?

15:56.434 --> 15:58.200
Perhaps that's why you should ask.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.567
Gareth, it was just there, okay?

15:59.634 --> 16:02.567
Yeah? That's its home. Leave it there.

16:03.467 --> 16:04.701
Okay.

16:04.767 --> 16:05.801
Okay.

16:06.868 --> 16:09.367
Okay.

16:09.434 --> 16:12.067
GARETH: Philip, get that off him! Get that off him!

16:12.133 --> 16:15.334
I'm going to let this go unless you stop acting like a fool.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.000
-Well, you won't so... -Well, I have, so...

16:19.067 --> 16:21.500
-What if that killed someone? -Oh, killed...

16:21.567 --> 16:24.834
Well, they'll think you're the murderer. It's got your name on it.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.968
Why would a murderer put his name on a murder weapon?

16:27.033 --> 16:29.133
To stop people borrowing it.

16:30.801 --> 16:32.634
David.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.667
I hate the fact you bring me down to this. I really do.

16:34.734 --> 16:36.267
-I resent it. -I don't know why you're laughing.

16:36.334 --> 16:38.033
Leave her out of it.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.834
You carry on. Listen, you bring me down to this, mate.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.734
-Heya. -Hello.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.400
What's that?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.400
Popcorn. Ben Elton.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.400
-Funny? -It's all right, yeah.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.567
Had a bit of a scare earlier.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.534
Did you?

17:01.601 --> 17:03.400
I thought I found a lump.

17:03.467 --> 17:07.567
I examine myself regularly but... It's fine.

17:07.634 --> 17:09.300
Terrifying.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.868
Testicular cancer.

17:12.100 --> 17:14.701
Cancer of them old testicles.

17:16.634 --> 17:19.133
-What's that? -It's a bit of Brie.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.067
-What, from down there? -Mmm.

17:24.133 --> 17:25.334
See you later.

17:30.033 --> 17:33.534
I've just got a complaint from a very important client

17:33.601 --> 17:37.834
saying that the figures I gave him are wrong and...

17:37.901 --> 17:41.467
Yeah. Well, basically, I've checked all other possibilities

17:41.534 --> 17:44.868
and it's come down to the calculator.

17:44.934 --> 17:48.267
Well, I don't know. Circuitry? Sorry, who is this I'm talking to?

17:48.334 --> 17:50.133
Redundancies. Now, it is true or not?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.834
-Okay. -Last in, first out. First in, last out.

17:52.901 --> 17:56.667
I don't know what source your little bird is from...

17:56.734 --> 17:58.567
All right. You give me a sum, then.

17:58.634 --> 18:03.100
No. You give me a sum, I'll try it out. All right?

18:03.167 --> 18:04.400
Yeah?

18:04.467 --> 18:06.234
Plus... (TAPPING CALCULATOR)

18:06.300 --> 18:08.467
Fifty two...equals...

18:08.534 --> 18:09.934

18:10.000 --> 18:11.767
All right. That time it was correct.

18:11.834 --> 18:14.500
-There's nothing... -Be straight with us.

18:14.567 --> 18:17.300
I am. I'm going to be straight with you now.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.100
I can't tell you at the moment.

18:19.167 --> 18:22.534
I don't like acting like a kid, do you know what I mean?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.767
But it's the effect that he has.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.400
What are you doing?

18:27.467 --> 18:29.467
I don't actually want to have to look at you, Gareth.

18:29.534 --> 18:31.367
-You can't do that. -Why not?

18:31.434 --> 18:34.167
-Health and Safety. -Health and... (LAUGHS)

18:34.234 --> 18:37.234
Why? Crushed by cardboard or what?

18:37.300 --> 18:40.234
No. Number one, blocking out light.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.000
Number two, misuse of company files.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.934
Misuse of files? Right.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.868
This is why the whole redundancy thing doesn't bother me.

18:48.133 --> 18:51.801
Because if I have to work with him for another day,

18:51.868 --> 18:53.868
I will slit my throat.

18:53.934 --> 18:55.968
You won't do it like that, though.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.834
You get the knife in behind the windpipe,

18:57.901 --> 18:59.634
pull it down like that.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.067
Or I could just apply for another job.

19:04.767 --> 19:05.868
Careful.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.534
Okay. Um...

19:13.601 --> 19:15.901
Thanks for coming in. This'll take a minute.

19:15.968 --> 19:19.601
Uh, right. I am aware of the rumours that have been circulating,

19:19.667 --> 19:22.500
and I just want to take this opportunity to put the record straight.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.801
I'm team leader! I should know first.

19:24.868 --> 19:26.234
Yeah. I'm telling everyone now.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.534
Just tell me very quickly. Just whisper it to me.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.968
-MAN: Can't you just tell us? -(ALL CLAMOURING)

19:30.033 --> 19:31.567
Yeah. All right.

19:31.634 --> 19:33.901
-Shall I tell them? -You don't know what it is.

19:33.968 --> 19:37.067
All right. You tell them, then, with my permission.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.701
I don't need your permission.

19:38.767 --> 19:41.200
Permission granted. Use it as you wish.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.434
Head Office

19:44.500 --> 19:48.868
have deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me,

19:49.133 --> 19:52.400
and Jennifer is talking of either

19:52.467 --> 19:55.167
downsizing the Swindon branch or this branch.

19:55.234 --> 19:56.567
(ALL MUTTERING)

19:56.634 --> 19:58.834
-And are you going to let her? -No, Malcolm.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.234
'Cause you didn't see me in there with her.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.701
For his eyes only!

20:01.767 --> 20:03.534
I said, "If Head Office try and come here and interfere,

20:03.601 --> 20:05.634
"they've got me to contend with." Okay?

20:05.701 --> 20:07.067
"You can go and fiddle with Neil's people,

20:07.133 --> 20:09.000
"but I'm the head of this family.

20:09.067 --> 20:11.100
"You're not going to fiddle with my children. I am, if anyone does."

20:11.167 --> 20:13.934
Yeah, but David, if they do downsize here...

20:14.000 --> 20:15.601
What? You think I'd let that happen?

20:15.667 --> 20:17.367
MALCOLM: It'd be out of your hands.

20:17.434 --> 20:20.334
It won't be out of my hands, Malcolm, and that's a promise.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.767
MALCOLM: Can you promise that?

20:21.834 --> 20:23.167
On his mother's grave.

20:23.234 --> 20:25.968
Well, I have promised it.

20:26.033 --> 20:28.467
Okay? And it insults me that you have to ask.

20:28.534 --> 20:31.701
-MALCOLM: It's just that... -Sorry, Malcolm, Dawn wants to speak.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.200
Go on, Dawn.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.367
It was just that I was in the meeting with Jennifer,

20:35.434 --> 20:38.567
and she said that it could be this branch that gets the chop.

20:38.634 --> 20:40.801
(ALL MURMURING)

20:40.868 --> 20:43.701
Well, if you were in the meeting with Jennifer,

20:43.767 --> 20:48.634
then maybe you should adhere to the ongoing confidentiality agreement

20:48.701 --> 20:49.901
of meeting.

20:49.968 --> 20:51.934
Yeah. Information is power.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.834
So you can't say for certain whether it's going to be us or them.

20:54.901 --> 20:58.234
This is my ship and I've asked you to trust me, and you can't go wrong.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.667
MALCOLM: It's not a question of trust.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.000
It is a question of trust, Malcolm.

21:01.067 --> 21:03.467
It is a question of trust. Do you trust me?

21:03.534 --> 21:05.834
-Do you trust me? Yes or no? -Yes. I trust you.

21:06.534 --> 21:08.367
He does.

21:08.434 --> 21:12.934
-So, meeting a-journed. Okay. -Good. Excellent.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.500
I'd have said much the same. In fact...

21:15.567 --> 21:17.601
Can I just ask? Do you trust me?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.667
-Hands up if you trust me. -You don't...

21:19.734 --> 21:22.133
-Well, you asked them. -Put your hand down.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.934
No, I need to know. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.467
Assistant to the Regional Manager. They're gone.

21:27.534 --> 21:30.334
I'm not worried for me. I'll be all right.

21:30.400 --> 21:34.267
But if there does have to be a cull, then so be it.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.400
I mean, that's just natural selection.

21:36.467 --> 21:39.234
In the wild, some people wouldn't survive.

21:39.300 --> 21:43.234
I mean, imagine a warehouse

21:43.300 --> 21:46.767
where a little midget fella is driving a forklift.

21:47.968 --> 21:49.968
He can't see over the top.

21:50.033 --> 21:54.133
He's got great big platform shoes on so he can reach the pedals

21:54.200 --> 21:55.801
because he's got little legs.

21:57.601 --> 22:00.367
Anton's a lovely bloke, don't get me wrong,

22:00.434 --> 22:02.901
but should he be working here?

22:06.701 --> 22:09.868
GARETH: Have you got a price for matte-coated SRA1?

22:09.934 --> 22:13.467
If I can't see you, I can't hear you, Gareth.

22:13.534 --> 22:16.701
-Just tell me, will you? -No. I can't hear you.

22:16.767 --> 22:18.133
I'm right here. Just tell me now.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.434
If you want to speak to me, give me a ring, okay?

22:27.133 --> 22:29.300
(PHONE RINGS)

22:29.367 --> 22:31.601
-It's on voicemail. -Leave a message.

22:34.801 --> 22:39.634
Hi. It's me, Gareth. I need a price on matte-coated...

22:39.701 --> 22:40.868
This is stupid!

22:41.133 --> 22:43.434
Yeah, it is... This is stupid.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.868
It's so... Sorry, mate, what do you want?

22:45.934 --> 22:49.434
Uh, I need a tonnage price on matte-coated SRA1.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.167
Because I've got 160 down here, but I'm sure that isn't right,

22:52.234 --> 22:55.467
because when I spoke to Glynn earlier on, he...

22:56.567 --> 22:58.901
Right. I know you're not there.

22:58.968 --> 23:02.300
And obviously you can't hear that, but I'm not talking to myself

23:02.367 --> 23:04.434
because they're filming.

23:10.067 --> 23:12.133
That feels nice, actually.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.267
-Do that bit with your nails. -Shh!

23:18.234 --> 23:22.767
That's no different. You can't do anything with your hair at all!

23:22.834 --> 23:25.133
Oh, no, trouble. Sanj.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.634
This is Sanj. This is Ricky.

23:26.701 --> 23:28.801
-Hello, mate. -Nice to see you.

23:28.868 --> 23:32.367
This guy does the best Ali G impersonation.

23:32.434 --> 23:34.367
Aiiight! I can't. You do it.

23:34.434 --> 23:35.767
-Go on. -I don't.

23:35.834 --> 23:38.100
-You're thinking of someone else. -Oh! Sorry.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.234
-No, it's not you, it's the other one. -The other what?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.167
-Um... -Paki?

23:43.234 --> 23:44.434
Ah.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.400
That's racist.

23:49.734 --> 23:53.634
No, I don't have a great many ethnic employees, that's true,

23:53.701 --> 23:56.734
but it's not company policy...

23:56.801 --> 24:00.934
I haven't got a sign on the door that says, "White people only."

24:01.000 --> 24:04.868
I don't care if you're black, brown, yellow...

24:04.934 --> 24:08.334
Orientals make very good workers, for example.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.000
You like a drink at the end of a week?

24:11.067 --> 24:12.901
Yep.

24:12.968 --> 24:14.267
Well, this is why we're going out. So we can have a...

24:14.334 --> 24:16.267
-When are you going out? -...end of the week drink.

24:16.334 --> 24:18.868
-When are you going out, then? -Tonight, hopefully. I thought.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.367
Uh, yeah.

24:20.434 --> 24:22.267
-Hi, mate. -Hi, sweetheart.

24:22.334 --> 24:24.834
-You ready, yeah? -Yeah.

24:24.901 --> 24:26.968
Would you mind if I went out for a drink with this lot?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.868
No, no, no. Come on, let's go home, yeah?

24:28.934 --> 24:32.767
Okay. I'll be a couple of minutes because it's 20 past five.

24:32.834 --> 24:34.200
You should come. It'll be a laugh.

24:34.267 --> 24:35.567
No. I'd love to. You're all right.

24:35.634 --> 24:37.534
-Seriously. We got to get off. -Okay.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.801
(TIM EXHALES)

24:51.067 --> 24:52.234
Um...

24:57.434 --> 24:59.767
-What's in the bag? -Just tell her I'll see her later, yeah?

24:59.834 --> 25:02.167
Certainly will. All right, mate. Take care.

25:07.334 --> 25:09.167
-Dreaded first day. -Yeah.

25:09.234 --> 25:12.100
-You all right? -Yeah. I'm all right, yeah.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.334
You've seen the vibe. Yeah?

25:14.400 --> 25:16.400
Chilled out. You know.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.601
Oh, dear.

25:19.667 --> 25:20.934
We work hard.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.067
I mean, we play hard.

25:23.133 --> 25:24.934
Play hard when we should be working hard sometimes.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.400
Partly down to me, sure.

25:27.467 --> 25:28.868
Um...

25:29.133 --> 25:30.634
I let them get away with murder

25:30.701 --> 25:32.167
and in return they let me get away with murder.

25:32.234 --> 25:34.267
The girls love me.

25:34.334 --> 25:36.901
Not in that way.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.467
But, uh, you know...

25:38.534 --> 25:42.167
I suppose I've created an atmosphere where I'm a friend first

25:42.234 --> 25:43.667
and a boss second.

25:43.734 --> 25:45.133
Probably an entertainer third.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.334
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Hold on!

25:47.400 --> 25:49.400
Practical jokes, yeah?

25:49.467 --> 25:50.834
-Right. Okay. -Right?

25:50.901 --> 25:52.968
Practical joke. Don't give me away.

25:55.467 --> 25:56.634
Come in.

25:58.601 --> 26:00.868
DAVID: Ah! And then Head Office said...

26:00.934 --> 26:02.400
Yeah. So, that'll be...

26:02.467 --> 26:04.467
-Fax for you. -Thanks.

26:04.534 --> 26:07.267
Don't go, Dawn. Can you pull up a chair? I was going to call you in anyway.

26:07.334 --> 26:09.100
I need a quick word.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.934
-Um... -Hiya.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.200
As you are aware, there are going to be redundancies.

26:18.267 --> 26:20.167
And you've made my life easier

26:20.234 --> 26:22.901
inasmuch as I'm going to have to let you go first.

26:22.968 --> 26:25.601
What? Why?

26:25.667 --> 26:26.801
Why?

26:27.500 --> 26:28.868
Stealing.

26:28.934 --> 26:30.067
Thieving.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.868
-Thieving? -Yeah.

26:32.934 --> 26:34.367
Um...

26:34.434 --> 26:37.167
Uh, what am I meant to have stolen?

26:37.234 --> 26:38.601
DAVID: Post-it notes.

26:38.667 --> 26:39.868
Post-it notes?

26:41.467 --> 26:43.567
What are they worth, about 12p?

26:43.634 --> 26:45.667
-Oh. Got your Bible on you, Ricky? -No.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.601
"Thou shalt not steal unless it's only worth 12p."

26:47.667 --> 26:51.601
You steal a thousand Post-it notes at 12p, you've made...

26:51.667 --> 26:55.133
-a profit. -Why would I steal Post-it notes?

26:55.200 --> 26:57.834
To make the little things in the end of joints...

26:57.901 --> 26:59.834
-Roaches. -Caught you, drug addict.

26:59.901 --> 27:00.968
No, I'm just...

27:01.033 --> 27:02.367
-Are you serious? -Yeah.

27:03.634 --> 27:04.868
I can't...

27:05.133 --> 27:07.367
God!

27:07.434 --> 27:10.500
I've never stolen as much as a paper clip and you're firing me.

27:10.567 --> 27:12.868
And the good news is I don't need to give you any severance pay

27:12.934 --> 27:14.534
because it's gross misconduct.

27:14.601 --> 27:16.367
So you can go straightaway.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.334
(DAWN SOBBING)

27:27.667 --> 27:29.133
Oh, now.

27:31.834 --> 27:33.801
That was a joke there.

27:37.234 --> 27:38.267
(DAWN SNIFFLING)

27:48.901 --> 27:52.267
Good girl. It was a joke we were doing.

27:52.334 --> 27:53.901
Well done. Settling in.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.334
Practical jokes for the good.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.500
"Thanks for these. Check them out."

28:00.701 --> 28:02.300
Better do these now, actually.

28:07.934 --> 28:09.367
You wanker.

28:10.701 --> 28:12.133
Come on.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.434
You're such a sad little man.

28:16.934 --> 28:18.167
Am I?

28:21.467 --> 28:22.567
Didn't know that.

28:25.834 --> 28:29.801
DAVID: What is the single most important thing for a company?

28:29.868 --> 28:31.100
Is it the building?

28:31.167 --> 28:32.801
Is it the stock?

28:32.868 --> 28:34.234
Is it the turnover?

28:36.500 --> 28:40.734
It's the people. Investment in people. Yeah?

28:40.801 --> 28:44.868
My proudest moment here wasn't when I increased profit by 17%

28:44.934 --> 28:48.667
or cut expenditure without losing a single member of staff. No.

28:48.734 --> 28:51.200
There was a young Greek guy, first job in the country,

28:51.267 --> 28:52.500
hardly spoke a word of English,

28:52.567 --> 28:54.033
but he came to me and he went,

28:54.100 --> 28:57.567
"Mr Brent, will you be the godfather to my child?"

28:57.634 --> 28:58.567
So...

29:02.534 --> 29:04.167
Didn't happen in the end. We had to let him go.

29:04.234 --> 29:05.734
He was rubbish. He was rubbish.
