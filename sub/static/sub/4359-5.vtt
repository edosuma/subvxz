01:13.800 --> 01:16.920
Okay, kids, what will you have?

01:16.920 --> 01:18.600
We got a line

01:18.600 --> 01:19.920
around the block.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.480
Curly fries.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.120
And a ginger ale straight up 
 with a twist.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.720
That's it? Sorry, kids

01:25.720 --> 01:27.840
it's a $5.00 minimum per booth

01:27.840 --> 01:29.160
no splitting.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.800
Since when?

01:35.800 --> 01:37.800
Since we became 
 a happening hotspot.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.240
We only have $3.00

01:39.240 --> 01:41.560
and we're dying for those fries.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.160
So, could you, like...

01:43.160 --> 01:45.160
I got a free booth 
 over here!

01:48.080 --> 01:50.240
Oh, no, look who's coming.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.200
Hey, Alex.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.600
What's up, Ray?

01:52.600 --> 01:54.240
Come on, kids

01:54.240 --> 01:57.000
if you can't pay, 
 you can't stay.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.720
Oh, sorry, Alex, if I had 
 any money, I'd loan it to you.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.280
Well, you don't, so, 
 uh, see you, Alex.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.720
Great hat, 
 by the way.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.840
Sorry, sweetheart, looks like 
 money talks around here.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.400
Where's your 
 paper route money anyway?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.680
I've got to look 
 towards my future

02:14.680 --> 02:16.080
so I'm investing it.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.320
It's what you call 
 "a portfolio."

02:18.320 --> 02:19.800
I have a share in I.B.M.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.880
And I'm trying 
 to diversify it.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.000
Wow, I need 
 to make some money.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.280
The kind that folds.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.200
The morning 
 paper route's open.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.480
You get $45 a month.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.960
Start at 5:00 A.M., 
 you're done by 6:00.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.040
I'm not exactly 
 a morning person.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.480
What about babysitting?

02:34.480 --> 02:35.720
That's a gold mine.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.960
Not for me-- 
 remember Ryan Cassitt?

02:37.960 --> 02:39.320
The spray paint kid.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.600
I'm in the bathroom 
 for one minute

02:41.600 --> 02:44.400
and he ends up doing 
 $200 worth of damage.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.320
My parents ended up paying.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.800
What about 
 your parents?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.280
No way, that would be 
 the last resort.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.640
<i>It's so embarrassing.</i>

02:51.640 --> 02:53.880
I never have money 
 to do anything.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.120
Sweetheart, we've 
 been through this

02:56.120 --> 02:57.200
a million times.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.720
If you want it, 
 earn it.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.760
Especially for 
 movies and fries.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.240
Mom's right, you have 
 to budget money.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.120
Learn the value of a dollar.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.240
I know the value 
 of a dollar, Dad.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.480
I'd like to learn 
 the value of $20.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.520
Sorry, sweetheart, 
 but I guess we wouldn't mind

03:13.520 --> 03:17.200
if you wanted to take up 
 babysitting again.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.800
I don't think so.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.080
Annie, hi!

03:23.080 --> 03:24.040
Hey.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.440
Can, um, I have 
 some money?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.800
<i>Can you have 
 some money?</i>

03:29.800 --> 03:33.840
No, Alex, you might 
 want to borrow some.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.040
Borrow?

03:35.040 --> 03:37.800
Sure, how much 
 do you need?

03:37.800 --> 03:41.120
Well, um, a $20 
 would be nice.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.040
Hmm, and what did you 
 want the money for?

03:44.040 --> 03:46.080
Um, I don't know... 
 The movies...

03:46.080 --> 03:47.360
And today, Ray and I

03:47.360 --> 03:49.640
didn't have enough 
 for French fries.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.400
Ah, general 
 living expenses.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.880
Yeah.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.640
I'm afraid you're 
 an extreme risk.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.680
If I loan you $20 today 
 with interest

03:58.680 --> 04:00.520
you're going to owe me

04:00.520 --> 04:02.720
$40 by the end 
 of the year.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.280
I'll pass.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.880

 Vince!

04:20.880 --> 04:22.960
Lunchtime!

04:22.960 --> 04:23.640
Vince?

04:25.320 --> 04:28.040
Dave, can I trust you?

04:30.040 --> 04:31.880
Meaning what?

04:31.880 --> 04:34.360
Meaning, 
 can I trust you?

04:35.920 --> 04:38.200
Vince...

04:39.360 --> 04:42.920
Dave-aroosh-- of course 
 you can trust me.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.080
We need to throw 
 Miss Atron a bone.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.920
You've got to understand 
 how her mind works.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.320
She's not going to rest

04:49.320 --> 04:52.360
until she finds the kid 
 that we dumped GC-161 on

04:52.360 --> 04:55.320
and it could be a while 
 before we find the kid.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.000
I see.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.320
So, we pick a kid, 
 we run some tests, and bingo!

05:00.320 --> 05:04.640
Miss Atron can relax, continue 
 her important work worry free.

05:04.640 --> 05:08.920
In the meantime, we continue 
 looking for the genuine article.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.800
Sounds okay.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.160
Well, I guess that means 
 we can move forward then.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.600
But what about the poor 
 innocent kid that we pick?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.040
Who can say 
 for sure?

05:19.040 --> 05:21.720
In the battle 
 for technological advances

05:21.720 --> 05:23.840
there has to be 
 some casualties.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.120
Hmm, so who 
 are we going to pick?

05:26.120 --> 05:26.920
Eeny...

05:28.880 --> 05:29.800
Meeny...

05:32.040 --> 05:34.080
Miney...

05:34.080 --> 05:34.800
Mo.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.000
I don't blame you, Alex.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.240
Dogs are so much 
 easier to deal with

05:47.240 --> 05:48.600
than little children.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.840
Binky, binky, heel.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.680
Binky, binky.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.080
It was so smart of you

05:52.080 --> 05:54.240
to start this 
 dog-walking business.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.960
And to think, 
 it all started

05:55.960 --> 05:58.240
with a chihuahua 
 and a dream-- binky!

05:58.240 --> 05:59.560
I've got to 
 find a way

05:59.560 --> 06:01.240
to pick up 
 some extra cash.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.120
I was hoping I could fill in 
 for you sometime?

06:04.120 --> 06:06.240
No way, my clients 
 would love you

06:06.240 --> 06:08.160
and I'd never 
 get my job back.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.720
But if you're desperate

06:09.720 --> 06:11.840
a lot of my clients 
 have children

06:11.840 --> 06:14.480
and they're always 
 looking for a sitter.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.360
I'd do it, but you 
 know me and human beings.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.040
It's a... it's a bad mix.

Well, yeah, I told Robyn 
 I was available, but...

Tonight? 
 That's kind of last-minute.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.200

06:38.200 --> 06:40.760
I'll get it!

Wow, I hope 
 they pay you well.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.800
<i> You're going to do it.</i>

11:42.800 --> 11:44.320
Do what?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.360
Spray her, 
 what do you think?

11:46.360 --> 11:47.360
Why me?

11:47.360 --> 11:49.000
I can't do it, 
 I'm too visible.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.240
If something goes wrong

11:50.240 --> 11:52.000
people will come 
 looking for me.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.640
Why? Because 
 i probably did it.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.920
You never said anything 
 about spraying her.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.080
I thought we were 
 just bringing her in.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.960
Dave, we have 
 to contaminate her.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.160
What, we bring her in for some 
 tests, and what-- nothing?

12:03.160 --> 12:04.960
Of course 
 we have to spray her.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.200
Otherwise, 
 we're back to square one.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.960
I just thought there 
 might be some other way.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.560
There's not.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.760
Now, if you have a problem

12:13.760 --> 12:15.720
I'll hear you over this.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.400
Now go.

12:19.040 --> 12:19.760
Go!

12:34.880 --> 12:37.920
Mindless, what's your 10-20?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.200
I'm right behind her, 
 bullethead.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.080
Good.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.680
Proceed with mission.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.800
Over.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.080
Would like to discuss

12:47.080 --> 12:49.360
moral implications 
 of mission, over.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.680
What? What are you 
 talking about?

12:51.680 --> 12:52.880
Nail her!

12:56.800 --> 13:00.040
Uh, would like to revise 
 and rework plan.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.040
Don't have heart to vaporize 
 innocent kid, over.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.480
Stay right there, Dave.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.000
I'm coming.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.320
<i>( Dog growls )</i>

13:17.600 --> 13:19.560
Moral implications? Huh?

13:19.560 --> 13:22.000
There are no morals 
 in this job.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.440
There are no morals 
 at all, Dave.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.680
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:39.680 --> 13:41.160
Are you all right?

13:41.160 --> 13:43.520
It's my old sports injury, 
 my trick knee.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.000
I went deep when 
 I should have gone wide.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.280
Can you help me?

13:47.280 --> 13:48.520
Uh... ow...

13:51.240 --> 13:52.920
Go to the telephone pole 
 over there.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.480
Uh, what are you 
 going to do there?

13:55.480 --> 13:56.920
Uh, wait for the bus.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.680
That's not a bus stop.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.640
Oh.

13:59.640 --> 14:00.640
Ow! Ow!

14:00.640 --> 14:02.200
I can call 
 your house for you.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.440
No! My dad doesn't know 
 about my trick knee.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.560
It's a trick knee, 
 and also a secret knee.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.280
Ow!

14:08.120 --> 14:09.080
Ow...

14:09.080 --> 14:10.760
But it's okay now.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.240
Thanks!

16:04.120 --> 16:06.200
I can't, 
 the alarm is on.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.240
What?

16:07.240 --> 16:09.200
The alarm!

16:11.120 --> 16:14.160
Wait, Alex! 
 They have an alarm.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.600
May I help you?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.360
Uh... would you 
 like a subscription

16:17.360 --> 16:19.000
<i>to the Paradise Valley gazette?</i>

16:19.000 --> 16:21.240
Thanks, but we already 
 have a subscription.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.440
It's only $6.00 a month

16:22.440 --> 16:24.040
half the price 
 at the newsstand.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.120
<i>I told you, 
 we already get the gazette.</i>

16:26.120 --> 16:27.800
How about a second subscription?

16:27.800 --> 16:30.160
Now, why would I want 
 a second subscription?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.720
I thought you might have 
 a birdcage or something.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.960
Never mind.

Jackie, stop picking 
 on that kitty!

 Hey, don't do that.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.240

 Jackie, time for your nap.

Whee!

 Ouch! Ouch!

17:22.760 --> 17:23.440
Mommy!

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
Hi.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.280
Hi.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.560
Whatcha reading?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.280
Oh.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.040
The new Paige Turner 
 romance novels.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.240
I hate those books.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.200
You can't believe anything 
 in them.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.480
You've read 
 this one?

17:49.480 --> 17:52.400
Yeah. I hated it.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.360
Have they gotten 
 to the island yet?

17:54.360 --> 17:56.360
Not yet.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.240
You know, it's hard to believe

17:58.240 --> 17:59.960
that dirk still loves Wendy.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.760
I mean, after all she's done.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.400
I know.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.360
Just wait till 
 you see what happens

18:05.360 --> 18:06.920
when they get on the island.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.760
It's, like, totally unrealistic.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.040
David.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.200
What are you waiting for?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.640
You know, there's a new one 
 due out in march.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.680
I'm sure the plot will be 
 shot full of holes as usual.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.920
<i>( Laughing )</i>

18:26.920 --> 18:28.440
Do it.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.360
Do it, do it, David. 
 Do it, do it.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.880
Now's the time, David. 
 Do it!

18:48.920 --> 18:50.040
Got to go!

18:50.040 --> 18:51.280

18:51.280 --> 18:52.760
Decent day.

18:53.880 --> 18:54.840
Bye.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.960
I'm sorry, Vince.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.360
You going to take my 
 head off or something now?

<i>( Sighing )</i>

19:08.680 --> 19:10.080
Why should I?

19:10.080 --> 19:14.720
I already know that 
 there's nothing in there.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.640
Nothing.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.360
[Alex] ...and two curly 
 fries, and two cokes.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.640
I believe that 
 meets the minimum.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.120
Save enough for a tip.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.320
Don't forget the little people.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.080
Look at her.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.920
Sitting over there 
 acting so innocent.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.200
She should be arrested.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.840
She should be in prison.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.400
She should be in prison 
 doing my math homework.

 what you want.

 my wallet.</i>

19:46.520 --> 19:48.440
All right, that's it.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.560
Remember, 
 lead with the left.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.680
Excuse me.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.440
Hi, Kelly.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.200
Talk about bold.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.360
Hi, Alex.

19:59.360 --> 20:02.000
I see you can afford 
 to sit in the booth now.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.240
That's nice for you.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.720
Don't let her talk 
 to you like that.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.360
Sorry, Kel, I had to work late.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.320
Work-- that's how honest people 
 earn their money.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.400
Alex, hi!

20:12.000 --> 20:13.720
Actually, Kelly, 
 I was wondering

20:13.720 --> 20:15.600
if your dad 
 ever found his wallet.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.640
No, Alex, and believe me, 
 we looked.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.160
It's just not in my house.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.120
Well, I hope 
 it turns up.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.160
You know, there's 
 a rumor going around

20:26.160 --> 20:27.320
that I took it.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.000
That's awful, Alex, 
 but you can understand.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.840
You were the only one there.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.360
Have a seat.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.520
Dad's wallet!

20:44.520 --> 20:47.280
Where'd that come from?

20:47.280 --> 20:49.400
Well, it did 
 fall out of your bag.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.240
I... I know, but, um, 
 how did it get in there?

20:52.240 --> 20:53.240
[Alex] 
 Hmm...

20:53.240 --> 20:55.680
Let's consider 
 the possibilities.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.760
Oh, I know, I bet 
 Jackie put it in there.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.680
Yeah, knowing Jackie, 
 that's a definite possibility.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.440
Well, I for one 
 am glad it turned up.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.840
I feel terrible, Alex.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.680
People think you took it, 
 don't they?

21:11.680 --> 21:14.360
I wonder where they'd 
 get an idea like that?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.720
Yeah, maybe you should 
 make sure people know

21:16.720 --> 21:18.440
that she didn't 
 take it, Kelly.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.480
Thanks, Scott.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.080
That's exactly 
 what I'll do.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.960
Good.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.080
I've lost my appetite.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.360
I understand.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.800
I got to go.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.360
See you.

21:47.520 --> 21:48.440
Hey, Alex!

21:48.440 --> 21:49.840
Wait up.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.120
You mind 
 if I walk with you?

21:52.120 --> 21:52.840
No.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.080
So, you mad at Kelly?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.360
Well, wouldn't you be?

21:56.360 --> 21:58.880
She basically told 
 everyone I was a thief.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.800
I never actually 
 heard her say that.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.040
Kelly's 
 your girlfriend

22:02.040 --> 22:04.560
so I don't want to say 
 anything bad about her.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.680
She just overreacted.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.360
It was just a misunderstanding.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.880
Yeah, maybe.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.520
So, tell me, how did 
 you handle little Jackie?

22:13.520 --> 22:17.640
Well, first I hid the spray 
 paint, then I tied her up.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.080
Actually, it wasn't that bad.
