00:36.451 --> 00:37.645
Panama.

00:39.154 --> 00:40.382
Panama?

00:40.589 --> 00:41.886
Best I could do, Andrew...

00:42.124 --> 00:45.355
...in the circumstances,
given your sins.

00:45.827 --> 00:47.590
They were baying for blood.

00:49.565 --> 00:51.260
I argued your case.

00:52.868 --> 00:55.769
"For his long service,
his fine brain in the balance...

00:55.971 --> 00:57.563
...against the gambling debts...

00:57.774 --> 01:01.369
...the blown cover and the wives."

01:01.578 --> 01:03.739
The wives.

01:04.513 --> 01:07.074
So, a last chance.

01:07.283 --> 01:08.341
Panama.

01:09.118 --> 01:10.779
Keep the head down?

01:11.921 --> 01:12.979
Serve out my time?

01:13.189 --> 01:15.521
Not quite, Andrew.
We do have interests:

01:15.758 --> 01:19.353
The canal, vital artery.
There is work to be done.

01:22.065 --> 01:24.932
But for God's sake,
be careful out there, man.

01:25.134 --> 01:27.659
There's a nasty web
of money-laundering...

01:27.870 --> 01:29.895
...drug trafficking and corruption.

01:30.707 --> 01:31.867
Really?

01:33.009 --> 01:36.035
<i>There are only 200
resident Brits in Panama.</i>

01:37.046 --> 01:39.310
<i>But you can surely ferret
out one or two...</i>

01:39.515 --> 01:43.282
<i>... who can gain you access
to the corridors of power.</i>

01:57.701 --> 02:01.603
Look, look!
The Bridge of the Americas.

02:02.439 --> 02:07.467
<i>You know, ever since
the canal cut them in half...</i>

02:07.678 --> 02:09.976
<i>... this bridge is now the only link...</i>

02:10.180 --> 02:13.081
<i>... between North and South America.</i>

02:14.451 --> 02:15.748
<i>Think about it!</i>

02:46.883 --> 02:49.977
<i>The way I see it,
we all have a dream of ourselves...</i>

02:50.687 --> 02:52.985
...that we could be more than we are.

02:53.356 --> 02:56.951
Well, Pendel and Braithwaite are here
to help you realize that dream...

02:57.193 --> 02:59.354
...in the Savile Row tradition.

03:00.596 --> 03:02.257
Let's try this one now.

03:05.169 --> 03:08.798
Oh, yeah, I guess this is kind of...

03:09.440 --> 03:13.308
I thought you'd like that one, sir.
Mr. Connery's choice.

03:13.510 --> 03:16.877
As soon as I saw you I thought,
"Who does he remind me of?"

03:17.081 --> 03:21.484
And that's it. In the build too.
Golfer's shoulders.

04:56.582 --> 04:58.607
How about that, Uncle Benny?

04:58.818 --> 05:02.481
<i>You've got the fluence, Harry.
I've always said it, and you have.</i>

05:02.688 --> 05:05.782
<i>You're the outright best tailor
in the world. Bar none.</i>

05:05.991 --> 05:08.983
<i>Steady on, Uncle Benny, steady on.</i>

05:13.567 --> 05:15.262
Harry, come on.

05:15.535 --> 05:17.560
- I'm coming.
- All right.

05:18.004 --> 05:21.440
All right, you get in first, Sarah.
Don't forget your belt.

05:21.641 --> 05:22.835
- Sarah.
- I'm trying!

05:23.043 --> 05:24.032
Mark.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.076
Okay. Bye-bye.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.301
George, George, I saw you yesterday.

05:56.744 --> 05:59.542
All right, here you go then.
How's your old lady?

06:10.992 --> 06:12.050
Sarah, Sarah!

06:12.260 --> 06:13.625
Hi, Bella.

06:14.061 --> 06:16.154
Dad, give me a quarter.

06:17.498 --> 06:18.988
Have you learnt your poem?

06:19.233 --> 06:22.532
<i>Tyger, tyger, burning bright
In the forest of the night</i>

06:39.388 --> 06:40.821
<i>- See you, Dad.
- Shalom.</i>

06:41.023 --> 06:42.251
<i>Shalom.</i>

07:00.840 --> 07:02.102
Look at your hair!

07:02.309 --> 07:06.211
<i>Oh, what immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful cemetery</i>

07:06.413 --> 07:08.677
No, "symmetry." Symmetry.

07:08.882 --> 07:11.407
I still don't know what it means.

07:15.722 --> 07:18.088
- Did you see the news last night?
- Yes, I did.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.487
Your people want their canal back.

07:20.695 --> 07:24.153
Not my people, Ernesto.
They're rabid, right-wing senators.

07:24.365 --> 07:26.299
- Do you know what they are?
- Say it.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.967
Assholes.

07:52.293 --> 07:53.487
You see?

07:53.694 --> 07:55.127
Turn around.

07:57.064 --> 07:58.588
It's only a tad, Ramon.

07:58.966 --> 08:02.733
If you want to look good in my suit,
lose weight and grow a foot.

08:02.938 --> 08:05.463
Come to the shop.
We can ease it a little.

08:05.674 --> 08:06.902
Okay.

08:07.609 --> 08:11.670
So, what are we gonna do
about the overdraft, Harry?

08:12.381 --> 08:13.678
You tell me, Ramon.

08:13.882 --> 08:16.976
You have to think
about selling the farm, Harry.

08:17.185 --> 08:18.550
Sell it?

08:19.187 --> 08:20.950
It's a gold mine, Ramon.

08:21.156 --> 08:25.525
<i>Angelo's turning it around. He's a
very good man, Ramon. Dedicated.</i>

08:26.061 --> 08:27.824
I hear you got a water problem.

08:28.363 --> 08:30.729
<i>Did have, Ramon, did have.
I put that right.</i>

08:30.966 --> 08:32.797
<i>Now, it flows like...</i>

08:33.001 --> 08:34.332
Water.

08:34.803 --> 08:35.895
Exactly, Ramon.

08:36.538 --> 08:39.701
Maybe you shouldn't have
bought it, eh?

08:39.908 --> 08:43.072
On your advice, Ramon. Fair's fair.

08:44.647 --> 08:47.081
The bank wishes to see
a substantial reduction...

08:47.283 --> 08:51.083
...on the outstanding sum
by the end of next month.

08:51.287 --> 08:52.811
Otherwise...

08:53.856 --> 08:55.221
...we have to call it in.

08:55.425 --> 08:56.414
What?

08:56.626 --> 08:57.820
The whole lot?

08:58.027 --> 09:00.086
But of course the whole lot.

09:02.265 --> 09:06.634
You are my friend. I hate
to do this, but my hands are tied.

09:06.836 --> 09:07.894
What can I say?

09:08.671 --> 09:12.630
What am I going to tell Louisa?
I bought it with her inheritance.

09:12.875 --> 09:15.776
Well, you're the storyteller, Harry.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.620
You're an angel.

09:40.337 --> 09:41.361
Someone to see you.

09:41.605 --> 09:42.572
Oh, yes? Who?

09:42.806 --> 09:44.637
New customer, he say.

09:44.942 --> 09:47.809
Hi. Name's Osnard.

09:48.445 --> 09:50.504
I phoned.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.279
Mr. Osnard. Harry Pendel.

09:53.951 --> 09:55.748
Very happy to meet you, sir.

09:56.553 --> 09:59.454
No offense, but I was hoping
to see Mr. Braithwaite.

10:00.023 --> 10:02.491
No chance of that,
I'm sorry to say, sir.

10:02.693 --> 10:05.924
My late partner has been dead
and gone these many years.

10:06.130 --> 10:09.726
Though his exacting standards
are very much alive and well.

10:09.968 --> 10:11.526
Glad to hear that.

10:12.704 --> 10:14.968
He dressed my father, you know.

10:15.173 --> 10:17.107
Back in his Savile Row days.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.976
Well, I never! Now that's a first,
I don't mind admitting.

10:21.179 --> 10:23.739
Father to son,
Savile Row to Panama City.

10:23.948 --> 10:26.712
- Did you hear that?
- I thought you'd be surprised.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.647
Surprised, sir, and delighted.

10:28.853 --> 10:31.583
Marta, put Mr. Osnard down
as an old customer.

10:31.789 --> 10:34.724
Arthur Braithwaite made
for his father.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.656
Now, if you'd care
to come this way, Mr. Osnard.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.826
What in hell happened to her?

10:41.799 --> 10:45.496
In the bad old days, would that be?
Noriega's time?

10:45.737 --> 10:47.329
Rough justice meted out?

10:48.573 --> 10:51.168
- If you'd care to take a seat, sir.
- Thank you.

10:52.811 --> 10:56.747
We call this The Club Room. Many of
our gentlemen spend time here...

10:56.949 --> 10:59.008
...in the lunch hour
and at the day's end.

10:59.218 --> 11:00.446
And why not?

11:00.653 --> 11:02.951
What did you have in mind,
sir, exactly?

11:03.155 --> 11:06.591
I thought I'd start with a few
lounge suits. See how they go.

11:06.792 --> 11:11.489
After that, well, the "full monty,"
as old Braithwaite used to say.

11:11.695 --> 11:13.458
I see. Very good, sir.

11:13.664 --> 11:17.600
Pity the expression's been hijacked.
Means quite the other thing now.

11:17.801 --> 11:20.599
- So they tell me, sir.
- Bollock naked, in fact.

11:20.804 --> 11:22.738
- Quite so, sir.
- Money's no problem.

11:23.707 --> 11:26.608
Take a look at these, sir.
See what takes your fancy.

11:27.110 --> 11:30.375
They're all the right weight
for this diabolical climate.

11:30.581 --> 11:33.517
Seven ounces of nicely breathing,
finest worsted.

11:33.718 --> 11:36.152
About all a man could
or should put up with.

11:36.354 --> 11:39.255
How about this one?
Alpaca, am I right?

11:39.457 --> 11:41.118
- Very good, sir.
- Perfect.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.317
And exactly what I should've picked.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.223
Given that money's no object?

11:47.532 --> 11:50.990
- So, what's next?
- Ah! The sun!

11:51.202 --> 11:53.261
Vital statistics.
Please step this way.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.869
Certainly.

11:55.139 --> 11:58.472
If I could ask you to slip off
your jacket. Thank you, sir.

12:11.923 --> 12:14.688
You were Noriega's tailor,
weren't you, in his time?

12:15.227 --> 12:17.354
I'm sorry, sir, is that a problem?

12:17.563 --> 12:21.397
Not necessarily.
Smelly little bugger, was he?

12:22.401 --> 12:23.868
If I may, sir.

12:25.571 --> 12:26.765
Forty.

12:27.006 --> 12:28.564
And the waist...

12:28.807 --> 12:30.240
What's the damage?

12:30.442 --> 12:32.706
A very creditable 34-plus.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.012
Plus what?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.311
Plus lunch, put it that way, sir.

12:37.650 --> 12:38.947
Very good.

12:39.151 --> 12:42.746
Do you ever miss it?
The old country? Savile Row?

12:43.989 --> 12:46.389
The Row. Well, now...

12:46.592 --> 12:48.116
...I do and I don't.

12:48.927 --> 12:51.327
Nothing beats it,
but when I was there...

12:51.530 --> 12:55.193
...I always felt very much
in old Arthur Braithwaite's shadow.

12:55.634 --> 12:59.799
Though it was Arthur Braithwaite
who encouraged me to spread my wings.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.908
- Good old boy, Arthur, was he?
- One of the old school, sir.

13:07.314 --> 13:08.838
Now, if I might...

13:10.417 --> 13:11.748
Very good, sir.

13:12.485 --> 13:13.918
Do we dress right or left?

13:14.120 --> 13:17.783
Most gentlemen favor left these days.
Don't think it's political.

13:17.991 --> 13:21.984
Never know where the bloody thing is.
Bobs about like a windsock.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.664
- You were saying?
- Saying, sir?

13:24.864 --> 13:28.766
Braithwaite. Telling you
to spread your wings.

13:29.202 --> 13:32.194
Yes, of course.
I remember it like yesterday.

13:32.405 --> 13:36.034
I was cutting a nice muted check
hacking jacket for Lord Braeburn.

13:36.276 --> 13:38.836
Finest mohair, dash of cashmere.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.306
I looked up and he was looking
at me from the doorway.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.447
Arthur Braithwaite, that is.

13:44.652 --> 13:47.212
He was a big man, imposing.

13:47.421 --> 13:50.151
He had a presence.
It's hard to put it into words.

13:50.358 --> 13:52.155
- It was the moustache.
- Moustache?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.692
Bloody great bushy job,
soup all over it.

13:55.329 --> 13:58.992
- There was no moustache in my day.
- I can see it now. Bright brown.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.601
I think we're being rumbled, Harry.
Admit nothing. Deny all.

14:02.803 --> 14:04.794
I think your memory's playing tricks.

14:05.005 --> 14:09.203
You're thinking of another man and
awarding his moustache to Braithwaite.

14:10.878 --> 14:12.243
Go on.

14:12.446 --> 14:16.576
"Harry," he says to me,
"I think you've earned your spurs.

14:16.784 --> 14:18.945
How would you feel
about taking my name...

14:19.153 --> 14:21.622
...and tradition to the New World?

14:21.823 --> 14:24.189
I'm talking about a full partnership."

14:24.393 --> 14:27.226
I don't mind saying,
there were tears in my eyes.

14:27.429 --> 14:29.727
You've practically got tears in mine.

14:30.232 --> 14:31.324
Thank you, sir.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.433
I've never heard such a load
of bullshit in my life.

14:38.073 --> 14:39.802
Come and sit down, Harry.

14:40.175 --> 14:41.335
It's all right.

14:41.643 --> 14:43.838
I'm your fairy godmother.

14:44.479 --> 14:47.971
The thing is, Harry,
I know who you are.

14:48.483 --> 14:51.452
More accurately,
I know who you aren't.

14:51.653 --> 14:54.850
- I don't know what you're saying.
- It's all right. Relax.

14:55.056 --> 14:58.583
Because I know. You're 906017 Pendel.

14:58.794 --> 15:01.194
Six years for arson,
served two and a half.

15:01.396 --> 15:05.356
Learnt your tailoring in the slammer.
Insurance scam, wasn't it?

15:05.568 --> 15:08.002
Set fire to a warehouse
for your Uncle Benny.

15:08.204 --> 15:10.695
They caught you
with the matches in your hand.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.737
You've never been near Savile Row.

15:12.975 --> 15:14.772
Braithwaite is your Uncle Benny...

15:14.977 --> 15:18.572
...raised from the dead, born again
and given a size-nine halo.

15:22.485 --> 15:26.317
Upon release, you did a runner to
Panama with your Uncle Benny's help.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.385
Built up a fine business.

15:28.589 --> 15:32.616
Married the daughter of an American
canal engineer. Well-respected man.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.561
But you owe the bank 50,000,
thanks to that farm.

15:36.764 --> 15:39.255
You've put in the shop
and the house as collateral.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.027
Not wise, Harry. Not wise at all.

15:43.037 --> 15:45.801
I can almost hear the creditors
banging on the door.

15:46.173 --> 15:47.266
Who are you?

15:47.642 --> 15:49.234
I'm Andy Osnard.

15:49.478 --> 15:52.743
New boy at the British Embassy,
finding my way around town.

16:00.956 --> 16:02.890
Strictly between us...

16:03.158 --> 16:05.649
...I'm MI.6's man in Panama.

16:06.027 --> 16:09.087
It's dark and lonely work,
like oral sex.

16:09.297 --> 16:11.288
But someone has to do it, Harry.

16:12.667 --> 16:16.000
I'm opening up a little network.
Keeping an eye on the canal.

16:16.438 --> 16:18.668
So, what's that got to do with me?

16:18.907 --> 16:20.966
What gives you
the right to come here...

16:21.209 --> 16:24.838
...sandbag me with my past
after I've paid my debt to society?

16:25.547 --> 16:27.811
Cool down. I'm bonus.

16:29.919 --> 16:31.147
Okay.

16:31.454 --> 16:32.443
What do you want?

16:33.556 --> 16:34.887
Your memory.

16:35.157 --> 16:36.556
Your "rock of eye."

16:36.759 --> 16:40.752
Isn't that the expression? Things you
know and don't even know you know.

16:40.963 --> 16:43.022
Highest prices paid.

16:46.202 --> 16:47.829
Get out. Now.

16:48.204 --> 16:49.398
Off.

16:49.705 --> 16:52.970
Don't be a cunt, Harry.
We're made for each other.

16:53.209 --> 16:56.303
You have debts, I have money.
Where's your patriotism?

16:56.579 --> 16:59.309
I had it out in prison,
without an anesthetic.

17:06.355 --> 17:09.722
There's five grand there.
Say it's on account of the suits.

17:09.925 --> 17:14.125
Call it "entertainment expenses,"
anything you like, really.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.458
I want us to get on, Harry.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.058
Go on.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.762
Show me around, is all.

17:26.076 --> 17:27.202
Do I have a choice?

17:27.444 --> 17:29.469
Oh, don't put it like that.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.207
It's a game. Let's have some fun, eh?

17:39.323 --> 17:40.381
Hi.

17:41.124 --> 17:42.989
No, nothing much.

17:44.094 --> 17:46.995
Well, sure, if you feel you have to.

17:47.564 --> 17:51.625
- Why not just bring him home?
- I think I'll take him to the club.

17:52.603 --> 17:54.902
Not sure. He's an odd chap.

17:56.007 --> 17:57.372
No, nothing's wrong.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.677
Your voice sounds funny.

18:04.549 --> 18:06.779
He called it a windsock?

18:18.396 --> 18:21.160
Se? Or. Good evening, Mr. Pendel.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.858
- Must have cost a lot to get in here.
- Had to be done.

18:26.070 --> 18:29.130
Hey, Harry, what about my blazer?

18:29.407 --> 18:33.173
Drop by on Tuesday, Luis.
It'll be ready to try on.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.345
Blazers, they all want blazers.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.175
You dress everyone here?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.681
Just about, Andy.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.409
So who are "they"?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.281
Who gets to join?

18:43.489 --> 18:47.084
Basically, 30 ruling families,
their lawyers and their bankers.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.317
And their tailors, I take it.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.859
When the Americans took out
Noriega, I said to myself:

18:53.065 --> 18:56.899
"Harry, they got Ali Baba,
but they missed the 40 thieves."

18:57.336 --> 18:58.598
Well, here they are.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.704
So fill me in.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.670
Nobody ever loses
their reputation in Panama.

19:03.909 --> 19:07.140
They hang it in the closet
for a bit to get its shape back.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.314
When they put it on again,
it's as good as new.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.218
On the dance floor, Rafi Domingo.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.080
Shipping and drugs.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.217
I could fuck that very easily.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.822
- Wouldn't be any pain at all.
- A lot have, Andy.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.023
A lot wish they had, who haven't...

19:28.234 --> 19:31.601
...and one or two have,
who wish they hadn't.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.640
Who are those charmers just come in?

19:38.144 --> 19:41.009
Government ministers
and the money boys who own them.

19:41.679 --> 19:45.080
At the table, bunch of gentlemen
from the loyal opposition.

19:45.283 --> 19:47.649
They come much cheaper, naturally.

19:54.392 --> 19:56.257
Welcome to Panama.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.825
A Casablanca without heroes.

20:00.064 --> 20:01.828
You are pure gold, Harry.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.361
Hey!

20:03.569 --> 20:06.003
Harry!

20:07.239 --> 20:08.399
Mickie.

20:11.777 --> 20:12.744
Harry.

20:12.978 --> 20:16.209
Mickie, I think you're
a touch refreshed!

20:16.515 --> 20:17.948
Please, come and sit down.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.617
"A man should stand on his feet."

20:21.720 --> 20:23.210
Anyone remember that?!

20:25.858 --> 20:27.485
Isn't that the next bit?

20:27.993 --> 20:32.396
"Never on our knees." Right.
Or on our asses.

20:32.598 --> 20:36.728
- So who the fuck are you, my friend?
- I'd like you to meet Andy Osnard.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.368
British Embassy.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.868
Mickie really is a genuine hero, Andy.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.237
One of the few with the guts
to stand up to you-know-who.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.002
Mickie, please sit down.
People are staring.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.977
I don't give a fuck about these fucks.

20:50.183 --> 20:53.914
These are the fucks who kept
that fuck Noriega in power.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.611
You know what I would do...
Mr. Andy, right?

20:56.823 --> 20:59.314
You know what I would do
if I was president?

20:59.526 --> 21:02.791
- What?
- I'd kill every fuck in this room.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.293
All of us.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.159
Look at us. Look at us!

21:09.269 --> 21:12.670
We got everything
God needed to make paradise.

21:12.872 --> 21:13.930
And what do we do?

21:14.140 --> 21:16.199
We sell each other.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.003
We sell our country.
We sell it all away!

21:19.245 --> 21:21.145
Harry, you take him for a walk.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.212
Look at these people, eh!

21:23.783 --> 21:25.115
Look at these people.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.913
You sold your souls,
you don't even know it. Stupid!

21:30.457 --> 21:34.325
If you make any more trouble,
I will never cut you another suit.

21:36.497 --> 21:39.432
Come on. I'll take you home.

21:40.401 --> 21:42.665
Sorry. He's an old friend,
you know.

21:45.406 --> 21:46.703
Hello, Harry.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.805
<i>Se? Or Delgado. Buenos noches.</i>

21:49.009 --> 21:51.477
Canal Commissioner?
He as clean as they say?

21:51.712 --> 21:53.577
Well, my wife thinks so.

21:54.315 --> 21:56.283
Come on, Mickie, what is this?

23:11.127 --> 23:12.526
Come on, Mickie.

23:13.729 --> 23:15.890
You're a good man, Harry.

23:16.098 --> 23:20.034
The only good men left in Panama City
are you and me.

23:20.236 --> 23:23.501
- That's all. You and me.
- Okay, in you go. Come on.

23:26.809 --> 23:29.300
He has heart, Mr. Cool.

23:29.512 --> 23:30.501
Heart.

23:30.746 --> 23:32.977
Come on, now. Call it a night.

23:47.331 --> 23:48.992
So, what's the story with him?

23:49.766 --> 23:50.960
Mickie?

23:52.336 --> 23:54.666
He was my first customer.

23:54.869 --> 23:56.427
Best-looking man in Panama.

23:57.706 --> 23:58.764
A god.

23:59.708 --> 24:02.472
Till Noriega threw him
into prison to shut him up.

24:02.944 --> 24:04.741
Didn't bloody well work, did it?

24:07.248 --> 24:09.876
There's more to Mickie Abraxas
than meets the eye.

24:10.385 --> 24:12.285
Oh, I'm sure there is.

24:13.254 --> 24:16.156
My people don't care
about the glorious past exploits...

24:16.359 --> 24:18.452
...of some shagged-out old wino.

24:18.661 --> 24:21.858
They want the real stuff.
Today's men.

24:22.465 --> 24:24.160
Tomorrow's, not yesterday's.

24:25.434 --> 24:27.868
We're not a fucking charity
for losers.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.970
I hope I haven't made
a mistake with you.

24:41.183 --> 24:43.777
Don't underestimate Mickie Abraxas.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.487
So?

24:45.688 --> 24:48.213
What if I was to tell you
he's still at it?

24:49.358 --> 24:51.121
At what, exactly?

24:51.494 --> 24:53.121
He's still in there.

24:53.763 --> 24:55.321
The Silent Opposition.

24:55.664 --> 24:57.895
The "Silent Opposition"?

24:58.101 --> 25:01.161
He's never lost touch
with ordinary, decent people.

25:01.371 --> 25:02.963
Deprived people.

25:03.607 --> 25:07.043
People who are tired
of the corruption, the greed.

25:07.577 --> 25:09.738
Do you know what the poor call those?

25:12.482 --> 25:14.006
"The Cocaine Towers."

25:14.251 --> 25:16.116
And our 85 banks?

25:16.319 --> 25:17.843
"The launderettes."

25:18.789 --> 25:19.847
Can we buy him?

25:20.057 --> 25:22.082
Mickie? Never.

25:23.794 --> 25:27.161
But he might allow you
to contribute to the cause.

25:35.238 --> 25:39.403
Uncle Benny, I fill up. I can't stop.
I get the wind in my ears.

25:39.610 --> 25:42.636
You've got the fluence in full flow
and the rock of eye.

25:42.847 --> 25:46.408
But it's a curse
as well as a blessing.

26:03.234 --> 26:04.758
How'd it go?

26:09.474 --> 26:11.908
Fine. I think.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.338
Hey...

26:14.679 --> 26:16.203
...get in here.

26:27.326 --> 26:28.554
Hi.

26:29.561 --> 26:30.892
I missed you.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.731
Wait, I'll take my socks off.

26:36.135 --> 26:38.000
I may be some time.

27:14.641 --> 27:16.632
Mr. Osnard.

27:16.910 --> 27:19.071
Ah, Andrew Osnard.

27:19.279 --> 27:22.715
Nigel Stormont. Francesca Deane.

27:22.916 --> 27:24.577
- Hello.
- Welcome to Panama.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.307
Thank you, ambassador.

27:26.553 --> 27:27.520
Please.

27:27.720 --> 27:31.713
I gather you've been having
a look round already...

27:31.958 --> 27:32.925
...quite extensively.

27:33.126 --> 27:35.117
Yes, indeed. Great spot.

27:35.328 --> 27:36.556
Right up my street.

27:36.763 --> 27:41.564
And how should we describe your
street, Andrew...

27:41.768 --> 27:43.395
...to the curious?

27:44.003 --> 27:46.404
I usually say
I'm in information technology.

27:46.607 --> 27:49.303
Oh, you're one of them.

27:49.510 --> 27:50.670
"A friend."

27:51.078 --> 27:54.206
That's right. I'm a friend.

27:55.082 --> 27:58.074
Oh, my dear, but it's a huge secret.

27:58.285 --> 28:00.845
Or it was, until Osnard blubbed it.

28:01.088 --> 28:04.319
I mean, I'm barely allowed to know it.

28:04.525 --> 28:07.287
Not the Osnard got
drummed out of Madrid?

28:07.559 --> 28:09.117
Foreign minister's wife, wasn't it?

28:10.162 --> 28:13.359
Not his wife. Mistress.

28:13.565 --> 28:15.829
There are some things
I won't do for England.

28:16.568 --> 28:19.002
Got your picture in the paper,
didn't it?

28:19.204 --> 28:21.729
Hence my posting to Panama.
What was your crime?

28:23.475 --> 28:24.442
Coffee?

28:24.643 --> 28:25.701
Thank you.

28:25.911 --> 28:27.435
Help yourself.

28:27.746 --> 28:30.978
Is it just exile, or do you
have a purpose here?

28:32.752 --> 28:33.844
Sure.

28:34.721 --> 28:38.213
The boys at home are concerned that
the world's biggest trade gateway...

28:38.458 --> 28:40.619
...doesn't fall into
the wrong hands...

28:43.496 --> 28:45.691
...now that it's in the wrong hands.

28:46.666 --> 28:49.760
Forgive me.
Don't want to seem presumptuous...

28:49.969 --> 28:52.494
...but I doubt you'll find
anything they don't know...

28:52.705 --> 28:55.299
...from our regular embassy briefings.

28:58.578 --> 29:00.808
Know about the Silent Opposition?

29:05.018 --> 29:06.417
There you go.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.887
You're a fast worker.

29:12.092 --> 29:15.289
See something worth having,
go after it.

29:15.496 --> 29:17.964
May I ask at what point we here
at the embassy...

29:18.165 --> 29:20.133
...will get sight of your product?

29:21.035 --> 29:24.004
My boss says no local sharing unless
he gives the nod...

29:24.204 --> 29:27.002
...but I'm not really bothered
about that.

29:27.741 --> 29:30.574
Say, the four of us in this room?

29:31.712 --> 29:33.703
I'd have no problem with that.

29:34.815 --> 29:38.979
Well, all that seems very
satisfactory. Nigel?

29:39.820 --> 29:41.253
Francesca?

29:42.022 --> 29:43.512
Good to have you with us, Andrew.

29:43.957 --> 29:45.652
Good to be here.

29:46.093 --> 29:48.755
Francesca will show you
to your office.

29:49.663 --> 29:50.823
Yes.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.496
It's a bit on the poky side,
I'm afraid.

29:59.741 --> 30:02.141
Bit on the poky side's fine with me.

30:02.344 --> 30:04.608
We thought you'd be out
and about a lot.

30:04.813 --> 30:06.178
Here we are.

30:18.660 --> 30:20.355
What are you listening to?

30:24.132 --> 30:25.121
The sea.

30:31.473 --> 30:35.035
Bloody thing's been sitting in
the warehouse all its life.

30:36.512 --> 30:38.639
Stuck on one combo.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.510
Tumblers all shot.

30:48.023 --> 30:49.320
Gotcha!

30:53.929 --> 30:57.057
Are you quite sure that it
was locked in the first place?

31:01.670 --> 31:05.766
I'm staying at the Gamboa Rain Forest
Resort till the apartment's ready.

31:05.975 --> 31:07.533
Come out on Sunday.

31:07.743 --> 31:11.338
Spot of lunch. Swim in the lake.

31:13.182 --> 31:14.376
See how it goes.

31:16.185 --> 31:18.381
I think I'm busy on Sunday.

31:18.622 --> 31:20.089
You're right.

31:21.158 --> 31:22.591
It was open.

31:25.328 --> 31:27.228
Just tight from lack of use.

31:32.436 --> 31:34.631
The ambassador's asked me
to brief you...

31:34.838 --> 31:37.398
...in case there's anything you
don't already know.

31:44.214 --> 31:48.275
Noriega formed these so-called
"Dignity Battalions."

31:48.485 --> 31:50.043
Dingbats.

31:50.253 --> 31:55.281
They were to beat the dignity out of
anyone remotely critical of Noriega.

31:56.726 --> 31:59.787
It was Dr. Frankenstein,
George Bush...

31:59.997 --> 32:02.625
...who created this monster...

32:02.834 --> 32:04.563
...when he was head of the CIA.

32:04.769 --> 32:06.566
And when Noriega's...

32:06.771 --> 32:10.673
...drug running and brutality
got too much, even for the CIA...

32:10.875 --> 32:15.710
...it was George, now President Bush,
who decided to take him out.

32:16.581 --> 32:17.912
And just to make sure...

32:18.816 --> 32:21.840
...they fire-bombed a big chunk
of the old city.

32:24.687 --> 32:27.884
Sadly, that's where
the anti-Noriega rebels were.

32:28.123 --> 32:31.251
The handful that Noriega hadn't
banged up already.

32:32.261 --> 32:36.425
So no more opposition,
silent or otherwise.

32:37.032 --> 32:38.260
Burnt...

32:39.068 --> 32:40.660
...scattered...

32:42.305 --> 32:43.738
...fled.

32:47.344 --> 32:50.211
Or risen again from the ashes.

33:02.459 --> 33:06.327
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody, here we go.

33:15.005 --> 33:16.404
Sorry.

33:31.722 --> 33:33.189
Mickie!

33:34.559 --> 33:35.890
Come in.

33:50.207 --> 33:54.303
Sorry about the other night.
I'm going through a bad patch.

33:54.512 --> 33:58.278
Is it money, Mickie? Is it?
Maybe I can help.

34:00.585 --> 34:01.779
You?

34:03.220 --> 34:05.780
You got worse debts than me.

34:06.825 --> 34:09.418
Mr. Farmer, huh?

34:14.065 --> 34:17.126
Do you still keep in touch,
you know...

34:17.335 --> 34:20.429
...with any of the students,
the fighters, from the old days?

34:20.639 --> 34:25.235
No, they're all lawyers now. Bankers.

34:26.143 --> 34:29.341
Haven't you heard?
We got a democracy.

34:29.547 --> 34:32.141
There's still a lot to fight for,
Mickie.

34:33.585 --> 34:36.213
I haven't got the stomach for it.

34:36.420 --> 34:39.481
I get the shakes when I see a cop.

34:41.126 --> 34:44.118
Unless I'm drunk,
and then I want to hit him.

34:44.563 --> 34:46.554
Either way...

34:47.165 --> 34:49.259
What about Marta's people?

34:49.802 --> 34:51.429
They loved you.

34:51.971 --> 34:53.268
They looked up to you.

34:56.676 --> 34:58.940
You should give up on me, Harry.

35:00.013 --> 35:01.810
I'm a lost cause.

35:03.683 --> 35:05.412
How much do you owe, Mickie?

35:05.618 --> 35:08.109
Owe to the casino? To you?

35:08.321 --> 35:10.755
All of it. All in. Come on.

35:13.092 --> 35:16.357
Not much change out of 20 grand.

35:17.163 --> 35:18.721
I'll get it for you, Mickie.

35:19.332 --> 35:22.130
And I'm gonna make you a new suit.

35:22.669 --> 35:25.695
A lovely silk and mohair herringbone.

35:27.273 --> 35:28.570
Okay?

35:28.775 --> 35:31.438
Okay. Okay.

35:43.123 --> 35:45.148
- Se? Or Pendel?
- What have I done wrong, Marta?

35:45.392 --> 35:48.259
Nothing. That's the problem.
Look at these accounts.

35:48.462 --> 35:51.022
Your friend Rafi Domingo.
Two months overdue.

35:51.265 --> 35:53.733
Carry it till next month.
He's a good customer.

35:53.967 --> 35:57.027
He's a shit. He made all his
money under Noriega.

35:57.237 --> 35:58.704
I'm going to charge him interest.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.806
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

36:01.008 --> 36:03.909
You're worried they won't like you
if you make them pay.

36:04.111 --> 36:05.271
It's a tradition.

36:05.479 --> 36:07.777
Gentlemen keep tailors
waiting for money.

36:07.981 --> 36:10.973
Gentlemen? Find me one.

36:11.418 --> 36:14.911
Your Mr. Osnard isn't one,
that's for sure.

36:15.123 --> 36:17.353
- What does he want?
- A suit.

36:17.959 --> 36:19.153
This is me, Harry.

36:19.994 --> 36:22.189
He's looking for information.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.763
Be nice to him. No sulks.
Promise?

36:26.234 --> 36:27.496
He's a devil.

36:27.702 --> 36:29.260
- Who says?
- His eyes say.

36:29.471 --> 36:31.530
I'm just having a bit
of a natter with him.

36:31.740 --> 36:34.605
Don't look at me like that, Marta.
I'm just a tailor.

36:34.807 --> 36:39.005
No, Harry, not just a tailor.
You are a dreamer.

36:39.212 --> 36:41.976
Which is why I have to
watch over you.

36:43.416 --> 36:46.078
Oh, speak of the devil. Mr. Osnard!

36:46.285 --> 36:47.946
How's my suit coming along then?

36:48.154 --> 36:50.486
When I put the shears
into that alpaca, I said:

36:50.690 --> 36:53.420
"Harry, this is gonna be
something special."

36:54.327 --> 36:56.694
A poem, is it?

36:56.897 --> 36:59.058
Great body.

36:59.433 --> 37:02.732
As long as her face is turned away
when you're fucking her.

37:03.637 --> 37:06.435
Marta's decent. She's been
in some very bad places.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.505
Oh, yeah? Such as?

37:09.209 --> 37:11.541
Here. Under Noriega.

37:15.749 --> 37:19.048
She stood up when the rest
of us were lying down.

37:19.253 --> 37:21.050
That's why they did her face for her.

37:21.255 --> 37:24.156
Are her sacred causes still intact?

37:24.758 --> 37:26.783
She'd never budge.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.358
Not Marta.

37:28.562 --> 37:30.189
So she's one of them.

37:30.430 --> 37:33.797
- One of who?
- The Silent Opposition.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.161
Absolutely.

37:35.369 --> 37:37.735
- Harry, stop.
- I can't.

37:37.939 --> 37:39.406
What is she?

37:41.476 --> 37:43.273
Their chief of ops?

37:43.845 --> 37:44.971
Head spook?

37:45.180 --> 37:48.377
- She's more. Much more.
- How much?

37:48.583 --> 37:50.949
You press me too hard, Andy.

37:51.886 --> 37:56.050
Sweetheart, you haven't even
felt me yet.

37:56.291 --> 37:58.282
Think "farm."

37:58.526 --> 38:03.088
She's their Joan of Arc.
Their spiritual leader, bar none.

38:04.465 --> 38:06.456
You're too much, Harry.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.499
Can I have her?

38:10.972 --> 38:12.997
Every penny you give her goes
to the cause...

38:13.208 --> 38:15.642
...without commission
or deduction of any kind.

38:15.844 --> 38:16.833
How much?

38:17.045 --> 38:19.411
For the pulse and soul
of the Silent Opposition?

38:19.614 --> 38:21.310
For Marta?

38:21.517 --> 38:23.985
Mickie needs 20 grand
to activate his units.

38:24.186 --> 38:26.211
Marta should get the same.

38:26.555 --> 38:29.456
- Yeah, I think we can swing that.
- Thank you, Mr. Osnard.

38:29.658 --> 38:33.321
London's tickled pink with this
Silent Opposition of yours.

38:37.366 --> 38:39.334
How is the farm, by the way?

38:39.535 --> 38:41.469
- Don't ask.
- Know who your neighbor is?

38:41.670 --> 38:43.900
The guy who's cutting off access
to your water?

38:44.106 --> 38:46.540
He's not a person,
he's an absentee landlord...

38:46.742 --> 38:49.176
...and a corporation in Miami.
And a prick.

38:51.146 --> 38:52.477
You know where he banks?

38:53.582 --> 38:55.709
With your chum Ramon.

38:56.085 --> 38:59.646
Not to put too fine a point on it,
he is your chum Ramon.

38:59.855 --> 39:01.823
Well, Ramon owns two thirds.

39:04.227 --> 39:06.422
Mr. X owns the other third.

39:07.063 --> 39:08.428
You know who Mr. X is?

39:09.332 --> 39:11.197
No, I don't know who Mr. X is.

39:11.868 --> 39:14.496
How about your farm-manager chap?

39:14.771 --> 39:16.238
Angelo, isn't it?

39:44.734 --> 39:45.793
<i>No!</i>

39:47.438 --> 39:49.167
<i>Mickie! Marta!</i>

39:49.373 --> 39:51.364
<i>Oh, for the love of God!</i>

39:57.615 --> 39:58.912
<i>Mickie!</i>

40:00.184 --> 40:02.880
- Oh, God!
- It's okay.

40:04.922 --> 40:06.514
What time is it?

40:06.757 --> 40:08.418
It's 7:00.

40:12.797 --> 40:15.061
I'll make breakfast.

40:27.144 --> 40:29.477
What happened to your diet, Mom?

40:29.681 --> 40:30.773
I'm in denial.

40:30.983 --> 40:32.177
What's denial?

40:32.384 --> 40:34.215
A very big river in Africa.

40:34.419 --> 40:36.353
- Ba-bum!
- Thank you.

40:36.755 --> 40:40.885
Mom, this girl in school told me
mothers who work...

40:41.093 --> 40:44.756
...feel guilty about their children.
Why don't you?

40:44.997 --> 40:47.557
Maybe because your father
is such a good mother.

40:47.799 --> 40:50.891
Listen, it's ballet today.
Do not forget your bag.

40:51.134 --> 40:52.931
- Let's go.
- Okay, come on.

40:57.974 --> 40:59.601
Are you seeing
the president today, Dad?

40:59.809 --> 41:02.243
Indeed. So we'd
better get our skates on.

41:10.688 --> 41:12.656
Harold Pendel.

41:27.104 --> 41:29.231
This way, Mr. Pendel.

41:32.043 --> 41:36.912
Working. Always working.
He thinks only of Panama.

41:44.822 --> 41:46.414
Se? Or Pendel.

41:46.791 --> 41:48.224
Show me your pass, please.

41:48.426 --> 41:50.326
Marco, you know me.

41:50.528 --> 41:52.861
I made you that
double-breasted mohair.

41:53.098 --> 41:55.566
I'm still waiting for you
to pay me for it.

41:55.801 --> 41:59.862
Through here. He's gonna give you
only five minutes, okay?

42:06.278 --> 42:09.611
Your Excellency.
Welcome back, indeed.

42:10.449 --> 42:13.384
Five capitals in one week,
I think I read.

42:13.952 --> 42:19.083
Paris to Tokyo in seven days.
A record for a world-class statesman.

42:19.291 --> 42:20.622
Pants.

42:23.328 --> 42:25.956
They'll know where Panama is then,
won't they?

42:26.665 --> 42:30.863
We won't be just a wriggly little
worm on the map with a canal, will we?

42:31.069 --> 42:32.536
Vest.

42:36.242 --> 42:38.802
I dispense with
the rear buckle as a rule...

42:39.011 --> 42:41.479
...with your handmade waistcoat,
Excellency.

42:41.681 --> 42:45.276
Too many of my gentlemen report
a discomfort to the lower vertebrae...

42:45.485 --> 42:48.545
...when leaning backward, relishing
a postprandial cigar.

42:48.754 --> 42:49.584
Jacket.

42:51.390 --> 42:53.950
Did we discuss the canal's future
on our travels...

42:54.160 --> 42:55.252
...if I may be so bold?

42:59.632 --> 43:03.534
So you want to know something
about the canal?

43:03.769 --> 43:05.100
If it pleases Your Excellency.

43:05.304 --> 43:07.397
You're halfway up it.

43:07.607 --> 43:09.336
I stand upright.

43:10.443 --> 43:13.037
Okay, just.

43:13.246 --> 43:15.214
I bend down...

43:16.249 --> 43:18.810
...my balls are in my ears.
- Very good, sir.

43:19.019 --> 43:21.749
You make your pants too tight,
Mr. Braithwaite.

43:34.368 --> 43:35.835
Harry!

43:39.673 --> 43:41.664
I've got a job.

43:42.609 --> 43:44.440
Shit, shit, shit!

43:49.249 --> 43:50.648
It's upstairs.

43:51.919 --> 43:53.750
No. Thank you.

44:03.698 --> 44:06.690
"Harry," he says to me,
"you make beautiful pants.

44:06.935 --> 44:09.927
When I was a boy, I dreamed
of wearing pants like these."

44:10.171 --> 44:11.160
His very words, Andy.

44:11.406 --> 44:14.534
To be quite frank,
do we have to meet here?

44:14.742 --> 44:16.733
It's not very salubrious.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.469
Good cover, Harry.

44:18.680 --> 44:23.708
They rent the rooms by the hour.
Cash. No questions asked.

44:23.918 --> 44:25.715
No paper trail.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.720
Anyone sees you going in, you're here
to get your end away. Same as me.

44:33.294 --> 44:34.955
So that's it, is it?

44:35.463 --> 44:38.523
Half hour's tête-à-tête
about knickers.

44:40.134 --> 44:41.830
What about the canal?

44:42.705 --> 44:44.969
Did he say anything about his trip?

44:45.874 --> 44:47.171
He had talks, yes.

44:47.376 --> 44:50.834
"Constructive discussions,"
was his phrase, I believe.

44:52.381 --> 44:55.373
You're not gonna pay off the farm
at this rate.

45:01.991 --> 45:04.116
Andy, this is hard for me.

45:04.324 --> 45:07.760
He confides. A tailor's like a priest
in these situations.

45:07.961 --> 45:11.362
For me, the changing room is
as sacred as the confessional.

45:11.598 --> 45:13.828
Lips are sealed, eh?

45:15.469 --> 45:18.870
Have you had a chance to make
arrangements about the farm, Andy?

45:19.072 --> 45:22.872
Well, the money's there,
as long as you deliver.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.220
- He's selling it, Andy.
- What?

45:37.358 --> 45:38.882
The canal.

45:40.228 --> 45:41.160
He's selling it?

45:41.362 --> 45:45.765
Has to. Needs the money.
Relieve the poverty. Infrastructure.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.490
Who's buying?

45:48.469 --> 45:49.299
Who's buying?

45:49.504 --> 45:52.200
Various interested parties, I believe.

45:52.740 --> 45:55.641
- Come on.
- He mentioned the French, the Japanese.

45:55.843 --> 45:57.174
And?

45:58.379 --> 45:59.812
Oh, yeah. And the Chinese.

46:00.014 --> 46:01.311
Harry.

46:02.050 --> 46:02.948
Andy.

46:04.085 --> 46:05.747
Are you pulling my pisser?

46:05.954 --> 46:08.354
Not unless the president's
pulling mine.

46:08.557 --> 46:11.822
This is fucking dynamite.
Does he always talk to you like this?

46:12.027 --> 46:13.324
Not always...

46:13.529 --> 46:14.587
...but mostly.

46:14.797 --> 46:17.265
Now this is for the record.
Times, names, places.

46:17.466 --> 46:19.525
His actual words, if you
remember them.

46:19.768 --> 46:22.259
Goose it up a bit.
It's going straight to the top.

46:22.504 --> 46:25.234
Here we go.
What kind of Chinese, by the way?

46:26.208 --> 46:28.199
You know, Chinese, like Chinese.

46:28.444 --> 46:31.971
Oh, fuck's sake.
I mean, mainland? Taiwan?

46:34.750 --> 46:37.241
The both, Andy. The two together.

46:37.453 --> 46:38.784
Hand in hand.

46:38.987 --> 46:41.683
It's something the president's
very proud of...

46:41.890 --> 46:44.324
...bringing them together,
at the same table.

46:44.526 --> 46:49.624
"Harry," he says to me, "if it's all
I'm remembered for, then so be it.

46:49.833 --> 46:53.200
I brought reconciliation
to the great Chinese people...

46:53.436 --> 46:55.131
...for the betterment of all mankind."

46:55.505 --> 46:59.066
You've excelled. This is a better
yarn than Arthur Braithwaite.

46:59.309 --> 47:00.401
Are you implying...?

47:00.610 --> 47:02.908
Doesn't matter what I think.
It plays.

47:04.247 --> 47:06.442
First installments:
Abraxas and Marta.

47:06.649 --> 47:09.675
- Installments?
- Payment on results, Harry.

47:09.886 --> 47:11.820
And the farm as such, Andy?

47:13.456 --> 47:14.889
Looking good.

47:15.492 --> 47:17.119
Oh, look at those tits.

47:20.363 --> 47:21.591
Yum-yum.

47:24.067 --> 47:27.264
You want to pay off the debt?
With what?

47:27.504 --> 47:29.768
Let's say I won the lottery, Ramon.

47:29.973 --> 47:32.943
And I want to buy your farm from you.

47:33.177 --> 47:35.645
What do you mean,
you want to buy my farm?

47:35.880 --> 47:37.108
I don't have no farm.

47:37.314 --> 47:41.216
Oh, yes, you do, Ramon.
I know all about it.

47:42.553 --> 47:44.111
Okay.

47:44.655 --> 47:48.091
You won the lottery, you can
pay me $3000 an acre.

47:48.292 --> 47:51.523
Two. You'll be paid
direct from Europe.

47:51.729 --> 47:54.755
I've made the necessary arrangements.

48:00.971 --> 48:03.804
You won't mind if I deduct
your tailoring bill?

48:09.547 --> 48:11.515
It has a bad smell.

48:12.049 --> 48:13.608
That would be the fish.

48:16.621 --> 48:20.352
I'll pay you back.
I'm going to straighten out.

48:21.126 --> 48:24.220
Just don't resent me
for doing you a favor.

48:26.731 --> 48:31.862
Harry, this is Panama, where no
good deed goes unpunished.

49:11.477 --> 49:12.603
Right.

49:13.946 --> 49:16.879
There's two ways we can deal
with this one, old girl.

49:17.081 --> 49:20.482
Sweat it out for six months,
then fall into each other's arms:

49:20.684 --> 49:23.482
"Darling, why didn't we ever
do this before?"

49:23.687 --> 49:26.918
Method B, the preferred one:

49:27.124 --> 49:30.287
Full-on affair now.
Observing tight security all round.

49:30.494 --> 49:33.588
See how we like it.
If we don't, no one's the wiser.

49:33.797 --> 49:38.633
I don't suppose it's occurred to you
that I might prefer someone else?

49:42.741 --> 49:43.730
Is that a no?

49:46.745 --> 49:47.837
No.

49:51.850 --> 49:53.511
Come and dance.

49:54.653 --> 49:57.315
Oh, God, you don't dance as well,
do you?

49:58.356 --> 49:59.846
As well as what?

51:33.053 --> 51:36.784
My chaps in London are in a bit
of a spin about it.

51:37.024 --> 51:39.322
I understand they're talking
to Washington.

51:39.526 --> 51:43.155
If the canal's being sold out,
how come we never got a whisper of it?

51:43.363 --> 51:45.423
I'm sure the question
is being asked...

51:45.633 --> 51:48.363
...and not to your credit, Nigel,
as political officer.

51:48.569 --> 51:49.695
What about the Americans?

51:49.904 --> 51:53.396
They've got billions in
surveillance. They don't know?

51:53.641 --> 51:56.633
Perhaps they do know about it,
but they're not telling us.

51:58.312 --> 52:00.576
You're very quiet, Francesca.

52:00.782 --> 52:04.684
What are your feelings about
Andrew's amazing discoveries?

52:05.353 --> 52:07.787
Well, I couldn't possibly comment.

52:08.589 --> 52:11.490
No insight into the Osnard methods,
I'm afraid.

52:40.089 --> 52:41.989
Try not to look so furtive, Harry.

52:42.191 --> 52:45.217
- I'm feeling a little anxious.
- How do you think I feel?

52:45.427 --> 52:46.655
- Something wrong?
- Yes.

52:46.862 --> 52:48.887
We bombed in Washington.
Sit down.

52:49.131 --> 52:52.760
The Yanks say we're talking through
our asses. No Silent Opposition.

52:52.968 --> 52:55.801
No conspiracy to sell off the canal.
No fuck-all.

52:56.004 --> 52:58.529
- They can't say that.
- They just said it.

53:02.211 --> 53:04.771
The Buchan material
holds no credibility.

53:05.013 --> 53:07.641
No credibility equals no cash.

53:08.050 --> 53:11.452
Without the Yanks, London will
pull the entire project.

53:11.654 --> 53:15.215
- Why?
- Because in matters of intelligence...

53:15.425 --> 53:16.949
...as in most other matters...

53:17.160 --> 53:20.755
...merry England sucks
on the American hind tit.

53:20.964 --> 53:23.194
It's called,
"The special relationship."

53:24.234 --> 53:28.671
Mickie will be very downcast, Andy.
So will Marta.

53:28.872 --> 53:32.328
What about us? We both had
a good thing going here.

53:33.107 --> 53:34.938
I was counting on making a pension.

53:35.176 --> 53:37.041
You thinking of retiring?

53:40.948 --> 53:42.973
Scrap heap at 45 in this game.

53:43.217 --> 53:45.845
It was blue chip material.
You said so yourself.

53:46.053 --> 53:50.581
London needs something solid.
Documents, evidence.

53:52.194 --> 53:56.358
Does your wife bring home papers,
canal stuff?

53:56.865 --> 54:00.164
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Does she? That's all.

54:00.369 --> 54:01.563
It happens.

54:07.276 --> 54:08.868
Take a look up its skirt.

54:15.651 --> 54:17.778
Come here. Come here.
Give it back.

54:19.788 --> 54:20.982
It's a camera.

54:22.891 --> 54:27.385
One picture's worth a thousand words.
Or a thousand bucks. Tell her that.

54:27.696 --> 54:28.560
- Tell her?
- Why not?

54:28.764 --> 54:31.255
Put her on the payroll.
Double your money.

54:31.567 --> 54:35.197
I want something in writing on
Delgado's dealings with the Chinese.

54:35.405 --> 54:36.565
No more bullshit.

54:36.773 --> 54:39.367
Louisa would never betray Delgado.

54:39.609 --> 54:40.940
She worships the man.

54:42.445 --> 54:43.878
Does she know where you're at?

54:44.380 --> 54:45.574
Not an inkling.

54:46.616 --> 54:48.880
Ever tell her about your prison days?

54:49.085 --> 54:50.109
Not as such.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.844
Haul her in, Harry...

54:52.055 --> 54:55.422
...or I might have to tell her
about Harry Pendel, the criminal.

54:55.625 --> 54:57.388
You stay away from her.

55:01.831 --> 55:03.731
Okay, I'll handle it.

55:13.109 --> 55:15.270
You're rather tense tonight, Lou.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.945
Maybe because you're peering
over my shoulder again.

55:21.252 --> 55:23.652
Or maybe because I had a call
from Donna.

55:25.356 --> 55:26.186
Donna?

55:26.624 --> 55:27.784
Teddy's wife.

55:30.127 --> 55:33.255
She said you were seen coming
out of the Hotel Paraiso.

55:34.632 --> 55:39.160
I said, "Harry's a tailor. He has
clients from all walks of life."

55:40.604 --> 55:41.662
True.

55:41.939 --> 55:44.373
You'd never meet them
at the Hotel Paraiso.

55:44.975 --> 55:48.433
I had a fitting with Andy.
Andy Osnard.

55:48.646 --> 55:49.977
He's a bit eccentric.

55:51.081 --> 55:52.571
Are you seeing someone?

55:52.950 --> 55:54.008
Me?

55:58.390 --> 56:01.518
You stay out late
and you don't say where.

56:03.895 --> 56:07.331
You come at me like a lover and
then you don't touch me for weeks.

56:09.701 --> 56:11.225
What's going on, Harry?

56:12.237 --> 56:13.864
Who's getting the rest of you?

56:14.139 --> 56:16.573
Uncle Benny, I'm cornered.

56:16.975 --> 56:19.375
There's nothing for it
but to tell her the truth.

56:19.911 --> 56:21.401
She deserves the truth.

56:21.646 --> 56:24.080
Harry-boy, I've told you
time and again:

56:24.316 --> 56:27.979
A man who tells the truth is bound
to be found out sooner or later.

56:28.186 --> 56:30.711
Try sincerity, that's a virtue.

56:30.922 --> 56:33.584
But truth, it's an affliction.

56:33.792 --> 56:35.817
I swear to you on my life...

56:37.128 --> 56:38.527
...there's no other woman.

56:39.965 --> 56:43.060
Never has been. Never will be.

56:46.272 --> 56:47.398
Okay.

56:56.248 --> 56:57.613
Louisa?

57:42.362 --> 57:44.692
I'm a thief in my own home.

57:44.896 --> 57:48.161
<i>But with best intentions.
With a good heart.</i>

57:48.633 --> 57:51.227
<i>For the family.
Like you did for me.</i>

57:51.436 --> 57:52.562
That's true.

57:52.771 --> 57:54.898
<i>You're the apple of my eye, Harry.</i>

57:55.106 --> 57:58.667
<i>Stay shtum, and I'll
always be there for you.</i>

58:00.478 --> 58:02.446
Harry. Harry!

58:06.719 --> 58:07.845
I couldn't sleep.

58:09.288 --> 58:12.587
What do you mean you couldn't sleep?
You were just out cold.

58:14.226 --> 58:16.285
Busy times at the shop, Lou.

58:17.229 --> 58:19.595
So who is this Andy Osnard?

58:20.199 --> 58:23.532
- Tell me about him.
- He's become a bit of a pal...

58:23.903 --> 58:24.870
...as such.

58:26.372 --> 58:28.306
I used to be your pal...

58:28.507 --> 58:29.804
..."as such."

58:30.910 --> 58:32.502
I'd like to meet him.

58:32.745 --> 58:35.213
Why don't you invite him on Sunday?

58:36.148 --> 58:37.740
That's Sarah's birthday.

58:38.651 --> 58:39.675
Why not?

58:40.719 --> 58:42.550
I could look into it.

58:43.055 --> 58:45.523
If you don't want to call him,
I'll call him.

58:47.326 --> 58:48.225
Good.

59:05.545 --> 59:07.877
- And this season's suits
are very thin...

59:08.115 --> 59:10.345
...and it's lined with Panama's
best fabric.

59:18.959 --> 59:20.119
Buchan.

59:20.393 --> 59:23.362
Lady Jane's. Twenty minutes.
That's two-zero minutes.

59:24.064 --> 59:25.326
Over and out.

01:00:11.512 --> 01:00:13.777
He's been waiting and complaining.

01:00:14.149 --> 01:00:18.586
Sorry, Teddy. Jacket's ready.
Just pop into the fitting room.

01:00:24.026 --> 01:00:25.823
Sorry, Jaime, I need this.

01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:33.024
In you go, Teddy.

01:00:38.807 --> 01:00:40.934
Wow! Even better than I thought.

01:00:41.143 --> 01:00:43.577
You look like Bobby De Niro
in this jacket.

01:00:43.779 --> 01:00:46.976
Don't schmooze me, Harry.
What's going on?

01:00:47.216 --> 01:00:49.810
Little bird tells me
you paid off your overdraft.

01:00:50.052 --> 01:00:51.644
Business is good, Teddy.

01:00:51.887 --> 01:00:53.718
I smell a story.

01:00:53.922 --> 01:00:55.288
There's no story.

01:00:56.159 --> 01:00:58.252
You want me to make one up?

01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:00.588
Don't. Louisa reads
your gossip column.

01:01:00.797 --> 01:01:02.788
I don't want her to know
I owed money.

01:01:02.999 --> 01:01:04.830
Come clean.

01:01:05.401 --> 01:01:07.460
Probably won't run it.

01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:11.532
I'm like that. The more I know,
the less I print.

01:01:16.279 --> 01:01:18.611
You know I'll find out
what you're up to...

01:01:19.582 --> 01:01:20.776
...don't you?

01:01:47.678 --> 01:01:49.942
Well, I had absolutely no idea...

01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:52.240
...how delightful
Panama was gonna be.

01:01:52.449 --> 01:01:54.849
Yes, it's beautiful country.

01:01:55.719 --> 01:01:57.744
I was thinking about the people.

01:01:59.021 --> 01:02:02.457
Meant a lot to me,
being able to tag along today.

01:02:02.658 --> 01:02:05.286
It's been a real pleasure
to have you along, Andy.

01:02:05.494 --> 01:02:06.722
Hasn't it, darling?

01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:09.655
Can we go and see the monkeys, Dad?

01:02:10.198 --> 01:02:11.392
There's a monkey island.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.568
- We bring bananas for them.
- Wonderful.

01:02:13.769 --> 01:02:16.499
- What's my birthday girl say?
- Can Andy come too?

01:02:16.705 --> 01:02:20.335
No, Andy needs to stay here
and keep Mommy company.

01:02:20.543 --> 01:02:21.942
You go with Dad.

01:02:30.853 --> 01:02:31.820
In you go.

01:02:32.055 --> 01:02:33.750
Cast off, captain.

01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:41.462
So, Andy...

01:02:41.831 --> 01:02:44.800
...maybe you wouldn't mind
telling me what you're up to.

01:02:48.071 --> 01:02:49.095
Sorry?

01:02:49.372 --> 01:02:53.775
There's something between you and my
husband, I know it. I can feel it.

01:02:54.777 --> 01:02:58.873
Ever since he's met you, he's
a changed man. Sneaky and secretive.

01:03:02.219 --> 01:03:05.916
All of a sudden, I'm his enemy
and you're his friend.

01:03:08.692 --> 01:03:11.786
If I didn't know him better,
I'd say you two were gay.

01:03:17.801 --> 01:03:19.735
Do you want it straight?

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:23.098
Always.

01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:24.941
You'll keep it secret?

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:27.599
If I have to.

01:03:31.115 --> 01:03:34.778
And he's told you nothing?
Absolutely nothing?

01:03:35.352 --> 01:03:36.546
Zero.

01:03:37.788 --> 01:03:40.018
Information is my business. Gossip.

01:03:40.224 --> 01:03:41.816
Harry's kind of gossip.

01:03:42.025 --> 01:03:44.256
He's smart, he's down-to-earth.

01:03:44.462 --> 01:03:46.589
He's got great contacts and no agenda.

01:03:47.065 --> 01:03:49.192
Are you talking about spying?

01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:53.760
Oh, that's much too heavy a word
for what Harry's doing.

01:03:54.973 --> 01:03:58.932
- Are you paying him?
- No money, I'm afraid.

01:03:59.144 --> 01:04:01.510
Just the honor
and privilege of service.

01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:07.779
Is that why he's been looking
at all my private papers?

01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.679
Oh, no. Harry.

01:04:11.322 --> 01:04:12.482
Oh, bless him.

01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.824
That really is going too far.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.856
Spying on his own wife.

01:04:24.002 --> 01:04:25.333
I'm terribly sorry.

01:04:27.773 --> 01:04:30.936
Still, you are the canal, aren't you?

01:04:31.143 --> 01:04:34.112
You sit at Ernie Delgado's right hand.

01:04:34.647 --> 01:04:38.640
Harry's aware that we're desperate
to know what will become of it.

01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:44.186
The canal is always gonna run
the way it's run.

01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:47.988
Ernie Delgado will make sure of it.

01:04:48.194 --> 01:04:49.661
That's as may be...

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.625
...but it's our main artery.

01:04:52.832 --> 01:04:55.858
You can't blame us if we need
constant reassurance.

01:04:58.571 --> 01:05:00.505
Harry's only trying to help.

01:05:02.408 --> 01:05:03.636
Don't...

01:05:05.344 --> 01:05:06.777
...use him.

01:05:08.515 --> 01:05:09.880
I love him.

01:05:10.917 --> 01:05:12.782
As we both do.

01:05:13.687 --> 01:05:15.177
I'm going for a swim.

01:05:17.757 --> 01:05:18.724
- There's one.
- Where?

01:05:18.925 --> 01:05:19.892
- Up there.
- Oh, yeah!

01:05:20.093 --> 01:05:21.890
Oh, he's lovely!

01:05:27.033 --> 01:05:28.295
So...

01:05:30.504 --> 01:05:33.803
Tell me,
how did Harry win your heart?

01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:38.174
I was raised in the canal...

01:05:38.445 --> 01:05:41.209
...around military types
and engineers like my father...

01:05:41.414 --> 01:05:43.780
...and I had never met anyone
like Harry.

01:05:43.984 --> 01:05:46.248
He treated me like a princess.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.981
Sent me flowers every day.

01:05:49.222 --> 01:05:50.656
Wrote me love letters.

01:05:50.858 --> 01:05:54.794
Did he have to get
Arthur Braithwaite's permission?

01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:59.828
He called him in London.
He was on his deathbed, the poor man.

01:06:00.034 --> 01:06:01.399
Oh, God.

01:06:03.104 --> 01:06:05.265
Did he fly over for the funeral?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.598
Arthur forbade it.

01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:11.567
Harry was completely wiped out.

01:06:12.111 --> 01:06:13.874
I'm sure he was.

01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:28.488
So the two of you have lived
happily ever after ever since?

01:06:30.996 --> 01:06:33.022
Yeah, until you came along.

01:06:35.535 --> 01:06:37.230
Don't you ever feel like...

01:06:38.138 --> 01:06:39.799
...breaking out?

01:06:42.509 --> 01:06:44.170
Running wild...

01:06:45.178 --> 01:06:47.203
...just for the badness?

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:51.712
Never.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.388
Harry is my virtue.

01:06:57.357 --> 01:06:58.654
Without him...

01:07:01.161 --> 01:07:02.389
...I'd be...

01:07:02.596 --> 01:07:03.995
You'd be...

01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:07.425
...like Harry without
Arthur Braithwaite.

01:07:21.616 --> 01:07:24.016
Well, she's finally asleep.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.054
I think she enjoyed her day.

01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:30.113
Yeah, I think so too.

01:07:35.696 --> 01:07:37.027
And did you?

01:07:37.598 --> 01:07:40.089
Yeah. Kind of.

01:07:40.968 --> 01:07:43.300
What did you and Andy
find to talk about?

01:07:45.506 --> 01:07:46.939
You, mostly.

01:07:47.308 --> 01:07:49.503
Bit of a boring topic, wasn't it?

01:07:50.578 --> 01:07:54.537
You're a very surprising person,
Harry Pendel.

01:07:55.883 --> 01:07:58.148
After all these years?

01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.846
Just don't come between me
and Ernie Delgado.

01:08:02.324 --> 01:08:05.589
My work is off-limits.
Do you understand?

01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:08.126
Okay, Lou. Absolutely.

01:08:08.697 --> 01:08:09.891
Done.

01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:21.069
Harry.

01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:22.866
What?

01:08:24.011 --> 01:08:25.774
Make me laugh.

01:08:35.357 --> 01:08:37.756
- You've got a gift for it.
- What?

01:08:39.627 --> 01:08:40.788
Letting go.

01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:46.024
- Few people can.
- You can't, or won't.

01:08:46.803 --> 01:08:47.895
No.

01:08:48.537 --> 01:08:52.667
- I've been reading your files.
- Oh, those fucking files.

01:08:54.444 --> 01:08:56.877
We know too much about each other.

01:08:58.413 --> 01:09:00.348
Kills the romance.

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.283
What romance?

01:09:03.019 --> 01:09:05.886
Oh, shit! Shit.

01:09:09.492 --> 01:09:10.515
Yes?

01:09:11.194 --> 01:09:13.219
Yeah. What?

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:16.529
It's a bit of a bad time, actually.

01:09:17.332 --> 01:09:19.665
I didn't know what she knew,
did I?

01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:24.505
Well, I'm sure you handled it
like a master.

01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:28.738
Look... Hey, I had to think
on my feet, didn't I?

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.609
All right.

01:09:31.415 --> 01:09:32.904
All right, if you must.

01:09:34.484 --> 01:09:36.077
Rendezvous number three.

01:09:37.421 --> 01:09:40.652
You know where that is, don't you?
Oh, good.

01:09:41.358 --> 01:09:43.326
Twenty-three hundred hours.
Good.

01:09:45.462 --> 01:09:48.898
What warrants dragging me out of
the saddle on a Sunday night, eh?

01:09:49.133 --> 01:09:50.100
Look, about Louisa.

01:09:50.334 --> 01:09:53.861
Some woman, Harry. I envy you.
The way she looks up to you.

01:09:54.071 --> 01:09:56.403
You're her moral virtue, her center.

01:09:56.607 --> 01:09:59.872
Just like Arthur Braithwaite
was to you, is what she said.

01:10:00.377 --> 01:10:01.742
I enjoyed the comparison.

01:10:01.945 --> 01:10:03.572
- You say anything?
- Would I ever?

01:10:03.781 --> 01:10:06.649
Expect me to tell her that
an old Jew brought me up?

01:10:06.851 --> 01:10:08.819
Burned his frocks as a favor?

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.681
Hated the old fellow, did you?

01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:14.689
- I know this place where we can talk.
- I loved him. I revere him.

01:10:14.926 --> 01:10:18.259
Dressed him up as Arthur Braithwaite.
Gave him a good suit.

01:10:18.463 --> 01:10:20.931
"Clothes maketh the man,"
and all that.

01:10:51.495 --> 01:10:54.555
Come on, let's dance.
Camp it up a bit.

01:11:15.385 --> 01:11:17.512
Come on. I'll lead.

01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:23.015
So, I gather you've made
no attempt to recruit her so far.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.558
As of now, that is correct.

01:11:25.762 --> 01:11:27.821
Seemed perfectly approachable to me.

01:11:28.065 --> 01:11:31.297
- Thought I'd have a go at her myself.
- No, don't do that.

01:11:32.203 --> 01:11:34.728
Is this what you came to tell me?
Lay off her?

01:11:34.939 --> 01:11:37.237
I came to tell you
I've had enough.

01:11:37.575 --> 01:11:38.405
I want out.

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:42.341
I don't think so. You've taken
the money, I want something for it.

01:11:42.981 --> 01:11:44.448
Those documents.

01:11:44.649 --> 01:11:47.243
Those ones that you snapped.
Did you read them?

01:11:47.452 --> 01:11:50.888
- I was pushed for time, Andy.
- Pension scheme for lock-keepers.

01:11:51.089 --> 01:11:53.922
Dredging contract.
Water analysis. Zilch.

01:11:54.158 --> 01:11:56.649
Time to deliver.
I'm tired of your bullshit.

01:11:56.895 --> 01:11:58.328
I can't go on with it!

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.861
You want me to tell Louisa...

01:12:01.065 --> 01:12:02.862
...about Harry the convict?

01:12:07.405 --> 01:12:09.339
Will you tell me what you want?

01:12:09.707 --> 01:12:10.731
Come here.

01:12:11.276 --> 01:12:14.041
Keep moving. Stop acting so butch.

01:12:15.314 --> 01:12:19.751
If the canal's being flogged off
on presidential instructions...

01:12:19.952 --> 01:12:23.888
...what's the price? Who's the buyer?
When do they sign the contract?

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:27.855
How much are Delgado and the pres
creaming off for themselves?

01:12:28.093 --> 01:12:29.560
- Right.
- Can't hear you.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.855
- Right.
- Then there's your end of the bargain.

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:36.329
Abraxas, the Silent Opposition.
Are they going for direct action?

01:12:36.535 --> 01:12:39.698
- Direct action being in this case?
- Shootibangs.

01:12:39.905 --> 01:12:42.066
Raising proletarian consciousness.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:45.038
Bombing banks, gunning down
a couple millionaires.

01:12:45.244 --> 01:12:49.044
- No, not Mickie, not Marta.
- So, what the fuck are they doing?

01:12:49.248 --> 01:12:53.014
Who are they buying arms from?
What are they gonna do with them?

01:12:53.218 --> 01:12:55.983
They'll have to do more than
wear white shirts...

01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:59.090
...and get the shit beaten
out of them by the dingbats!

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.192
- Come on.
- I've got to get out.

01:13:01.428 --> 01:13:03.020
I can't think.

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.894
- I can't breathe.
- Go, Harry. Go, go, go.

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:12.764
Get me some answers.
Your ass is on the line.

01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:15.737
London's coming.
Get the stuff, we make you rich.

01:13:15.942 --> 01:13:19.343
You don't, we tell the Pans
you've been spying for the Yanks.

01:13:19.546 --> 01:13:22.743
You and Louisa both.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:34.092
I haven't come clean with you.

01:13:35.028 --> 01:13:36.894
I've been dragging my feet.

01:13:37.264 --> 01:13:39.289
At Mickie's behest, I might add.

01:13:40.401 --> 01:13:42.995
He has a huge arms shipment
on the way.

01:13:43.204 --> 01:13:45.604
But he'll pay for it
from another source.

01:13:45.806 --> 01:13:48.832
Oh, yeah? Who the fuck would that be?

01:13:49.043 --> 01:13:50.374
Won't say.

01:13:50.778 --> 01:13:52.678
No, he wouldn't, would he?

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.974
- How much?
- It's big money, Andy.

01:13:56.183 --> 01:13:59.209
"Harry," he says to me,
"your guys pay peanuts.

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.047
This is out of their league."

01:14:02.156 --> 01:14:03.282
Well...

01:14:04.492 --> 01:14:07.256
...this is an interesting
development, Harry.

01:14:07.928 --> 01:14:10.362
- Give me a ballpark figure.
- Ten.

01:14:10.564 --> 01:14:13.260
We're talking
ten million dollars, Andy.

01:14:13.467 --> 01:14:14.934
Ten million dollars?

01:14:15.736 --> 01:14:16.703
Yeah.

01:14:17.438 --> 01:14:20.033
Ten million dollars.

01:14:22.844 --> 01:14:24.141
Yeah.

01:14:33.522 --> 01:14:35.183
- Andrew.
- Sir.

01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:37.620
The winds of fortune
blew me to Caracas...

01:14:37.826 --> 01:14:41.316
...allowing me this brief stopover.
I'm on my way to Washington.

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:45.930
Our revered leader, Henry Cavendish,
is coming too. Pick up the phone.

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:48.066
There's prestige at stake, you see.

01:14:48.268 --> 01:14:49.132
Oh, Andrew...

01:14:50.036 --> 01:14:54.132
...I've come all this way to look
you in the eye and ask you this:

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:58.606
Can you back it up?
Are we copper-bottomed?

01:14:59.979 --> 01:15:01.242
Yes.

01:15:03.417 --> 01:15:06.853
- How much are they asking for?
- Fifteen million.

01:15:07.388 --> 01:15:08.650
Fifteen.

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:12.288
If I get it for you,
can you guarantee action?

01:15:12.593 --> 01:15:13.958
Oh, absolutely.

01:15:14.195 --> 01:15:15.662
Go after them, Andrew.

01:15:15.863 --> 01:15:19.663
Push. The iron is hot.
Strike!

01:15:23.671 --> 01:15:26.970
Sir, can I have your glass?
We are ready for landing.

01:15:30.044 --> 01:15:31.238
Thank you.

01:15:41.489 --> 01:15:44.220
Oh, Harry. I hear that Delgado...

01:15:44.426 --> 01:15:47.486
...is setting up a canal
police force...

01:15:47.729 --> 01:15:49.754
...with powers to search the ships.

01:15:49.998 --> 01:15:55.300
It'll never happen. It would kill
the drug trade, the arms trade...

01:15:55.537 --> 01:15:57.698
...everything we hold dear.

01:15:58.106 --> 01:16:00.768
The way it is now,
you pay your dues...

01:16:00.976 --> 01:16:04.571
...you don't piss in the locks,
they don't fuck with you.

01:16:04.779 --> 01:16:08.044
Does Louisa know anything
about this little plan, Harry?

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:09.808
Leave Louisa out of this.

01:16:10.018 --> 01:16:14.318
Take it easy, Harry.
Time you took some holiday.

01:16:15.023 --> 01:16:18.424
- You look fucked out.
- Maybe if you paid your bill...

01:16:18.627 --> 01:16:21.323
...I might be able to.
- Maybe you'd be healthier...

01:16:21.563 --> 01:16:23.258
...if you stuck to tailoring.

01:16:23.565 --> 01:16:25.796
- Listen, Teddy...
- Hey, Harry.

01:16:26.435 --> 01:16:27.902
It doesn't look right.

01:16:28.137 --> 01:16:30.298
This isn't a suit,
it's a piece of shit.

01:16:31.908 --> 01:16:34.843
Come on, it's the first fitting.
It can be fixed.

01:16:35.044 --> 01:16:37.410
I don't know.
Think I'm gonna go to Armani.

01:16:37.747 --> 01:16:39.738
Get myself a proper suit.

01:16:42.451 --> 01:16:45.318
He doesn't like it when
I mention Armani.

01:16:45.521 --> 01:16:47.614
Harry, why you make me this shit?

01:16:47.823 --> 01:16:49.848
Why can't you make
a suit like Armani?

01:16:50.059 --> 01:16:51.822
Why can't I make
a suit like Armani?

01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.426
You think Armani can make
a suit like Harry Pendel?

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.928
Why not?

01:16:59.368 --> 01:17:02.963
Okay, fuck off. Go down the road,
buy an Armani!

01:17:03.172 --> 01:17:05.697
Save yourself $1000,
see if I care!

01:17:05.908 --> 01:17:08.844
At Pendel and Braithwaite
you get Savile Row tailoring...

01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:11.173
...with 400 years of tradition
behind it.

01:17:11.381 --> 01:17:14.043
Down the road you get an
Italian gents' outfitter.

01:17:14.251 --> 01:17:16.947
If you don't understand,
then save your money.

01:17:17.154 --> 01:17:18.519
Hey, Harry, come on.

01:17:19.122 --> 01:17:22.057
The whole country's
going down the plug hole!

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:24.250
Nobody cares!

01:17:24.461 --> 01:17:27.055
Someone's got to stand up
and be counted!

01:17:27.297 --> 01:17:31.063
Someone has to say, "Here I am.
This is what I stand for!"

01:17:31.268 --> 01:17:33.259
Impeccable standards and...

01:17:33.503 --> 01:17:35.164
...and old-fashioned integrity!

01:17:35.372 --> 01:17:38.205
And if you don't like it,
you can go down the road!

01:17:38.642 --> 01:17:40.701
Gentlemen, you go down that road...

01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:42.344
...you can never come back.

01:17:42.546 --> 01:17:46.038
When you've gone down that road
it's over, it's curtains.

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.650
And I'm not just talking about Panama!

01:17:48.852 --> 01:17:51.913
I'm talking about
the whole human race.

01:18:01.866 --> 01:18:04.266
You too. Get out.

01:18:09.173 --> 01:18:11.641
Harry, I was only kidding, I swear.

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:15.841
It's just a sleeve.
I swear to God.

01:18:23.588 --> 01:18:25.146
Teddy came to see Mickie.

01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:29.224
He brought two goons with him.
Said they were Ministry of Interior.

01:18:29.427 --> 01:18:30.519
Teddy?

01:18:30.795 --> 01:18:32.593
Of course, he's the worst.

01:18:32.798 --> 01:18:34.925
They pay him, the ruling families.

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:37.328
He takes money to inform
on his friends.

01:18:37.703 --> 01:18:39.728
They were asking around about us.

01:18:40.372 --> 01:18:41.896
They came to me too.

01:18:42.808 --> 01:18:46.209
Thinks we're involved in a
political thing against the system.

01:18:46.412 --> 01:18:48.004
You know, like the old times.

01:18:48.213 --> 01:18:50.681
- You and Marta?
- You and Mickie.

01:18:50.883 --> 01:18:52.680
Why would they think that?

01:18:53.118 --> 01:18:54.378
Maybe you know, Harry.

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.649
I couldn't do it again.

01:18:59.656 --> 01:19:03.217
No more prison.
They break you in there.

01:19:04.394 --> 01:19:07.852
You got so much courage in life.
When it's gone, it's spent.

01:19:09.032 --> 01:19:10.522
I got none left.

01:19:10.734 --> 01:19:13.703
I know what you mean.
I've been there, I know.

01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:18.538
And they came to you?

01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:24.006
Big Chinese guy.
The man who beat her before.

01:19:24.849 --> 01:19:28.683
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing. They wanted information.

01:19:28.886 --> 01:19:33.550
If I didn't give it to them, they'd
make me look the same, both sides.

01:19:33.758 --> 01:19:36.454
- What information?
- About the two of you.

01:19:36.661 --> 01:19:38.754
How often you meet,
what you talk about.

01:19:38.996 --> 01:19:42.693
I want you both to get out of town.
Take a holiday.

01:19:43.434 --> 01:19:45.868
There's a fireworks festival
in Guarare.

01:19:46.104 --> 01:19:48.800
You love fireworks.
The address is on the label.

01:19:49.006 --> 01:19:50.997
Pete Abuleira lent it to me.

01:19:51.209 --> 01:19:52.938
What are you going to do?

01:19:53.144 --> 01:19:54.577
Sort it out.

01:19:55.313 --> 01:19:57.111
Talk to people I know.

01:20:00.185 --> 01:20:02.050
Better we go in separate cars.

01:20:02.254 --> 01:20:03.448
I follow you later.

01:20:03.655 --> 01:20:05.452
No more drinking now.

01:20:07.159 --> 01:20:08.592
Thanks, Harry.

01:20:09.194 --> 01:20:10.024
Take care.

01:20:15.434 --> 01:20:18.130
I never lied to you, Marta.
You know that.

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:21.897
I didn't tell you everything,
but what I told you was true.

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:26.671
There's only so many people you
can do that to. Tell the truth.

01:20:27.212 --> 01:20:29.772
Other people are different.
They need to be...

01:20:30.015 --> 01:20:31.346
Tailored.

01:20:31.784 --> 01:20:33.411
Helped. Yes.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.689
You flatter them. You make things up.

01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:40.919
They start believing you, Harry.

01:20:41.194 --> 01:20:44.561
Their leading man is one
Michelangelo Abraxas.

01:20:44.931 --> 01:20:48.230
<i>Known to many, I am sure,
as the elusive Pimpernel...</i>

01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:52.461
<i>... of the popular movement
against General Manuel Noriega.</i>

01:20:52.772 --> 01:20:55.240
<i>Abraxas is a man
of proven integrity...</i>

01:20:55.442 --> 01:20:57.637
<i>... skilled in clandestine warfare.</i>

01:20:58.311 --> 01:20:59.869
His second in command...

01:21:00.079 --> 01:21:03.014
...but I submit his equal
in skill and resolution...

01:21:03.216 --> 01:21:04.843
...is code name "Marta."

01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:08.778
Another veteran of the
anti-Noriega resistance.

01:21:09.289 --> 01:21:12.656
For cover purposes, she is
employed as accountant receptionist...

01:21:12.859 --> 01:21:15.350
...by our own Panamanian head agent...

01:21:15.562 --> 01:21:17.496
...the redoubtable Buchan.

01:21:18.198 --> 01:21:21.258
If I may say so, Elliot,
a "Silent Opposition"...

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:23.493
...doesn't send radio messages.

01:21:23.704 --> 01:21:25.399
Half don't possess telephones.

01:21:25.639 --> 01:21:28.699
Why else would they call
themselves silent?

01:21:28.943 --> 01:21:31.138
They're a life-force, not an embassy.

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:33.677
Fishermen...

01:21:34.982 --> 01:21:38.213
...small farmers, peasants,
have-nots, penniless students.

01:21:38.419 --> 01:21:40.979
People we wouldn't
entertain in the woodshed.

01:21:41.255 --> 01:21:43.917
So why should we support them, Henry?

01:21:44.124 --> 01:21:46.490
Because if we don't,
someone else will.

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:50.391
Because the Silent Opposition is
the new Panama in the new millennium.

01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:52.926
And getting in with these chaps...

01:21:53.133 --> 01:21:56.694
...is the sweetest, cheapest
way of saving the canal.

01:21:57.338 --> 01:22:00.239
Do you think personally,
this Abraxas is...

01:22:00.441 --> 01:22:03.035
...presidential material?

01:22:03.244 --> 01:22:04.075
Scotty.

01:22:04.312 --> 01:22:07.281
Abraxas is world-class.
Courageous...

01:22:07.482 --> 01:22:10.349
<i>... unsullied, incorruptible.</i>

01:22:10.552 --> 01:22:13.419
<i>A man to dream of
when you're shaping nations.</i>

01:22:25.133 --> 01:22:28.830
But Abraxas can't go it alone.
He needs our support now.

01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:31.004
If U.S. Military assistance
is guaranteed...

01:22:31.239 --> 01:22:34.640
...Abraxas and his forces will
launch an attack on the government.

01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:39.074
They'll commandeer the radio stations
and the Canal Administration Office.

01:22:39.281 --> 01:22:41.875
Subject, of course,
to advance payment...

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.415
...for arms, equipment
and medical supplies.

01:22:45.654 --> 01:22:46.781
How much?

01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:51.087
The sort of money you boys
leave under the plate, Elliot.

01:22:52.194 --> 01:22:55.595
- How much?
- Twenty million dollars.

01:22:59.068 --> 01:23:01.866
Elliot, may I say a couple
of words, please?

01:23:03.773 --> 01:23:06.003
I'm only a rookie at heart.

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:10.836
I don't know too much about the ins
and outs of politics, but I know this:

01:23:11.078 --> 01:23:15.515
I was the last American
commander in Panama.

01:23:16.050 --> 01:23:19.486
I had the task of taking
our men out of there.

01:23:21.055 --> 01:23:23.216
Only retreat of my career.

01:23:27.027 --> 01:23:28.689
Broke my heart.

01:23:31.866 --> 01:23:35.825
There is a missing star
on our flag, gentlemen.

01:23:37.472 --> 01:23:41.670
Looks to me that God has
given us a second chance here.

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.008
Yes?

01:23:49.484 --> 01:23:50.644
Sir.

01:23:55.223 --> 01:23:56.690
Encrypted.

01:23:57.559 --> 01:23:59.823
It went over like ninepins.

01:24:00.028 --> 01:24:01.996
Asked for 20 and guess what?

01:24:02.197 --> 01:24:04.495
They beat me down to 15.

01:24:04.699 --> 01:24:06.132
I'm on my way.

01:24:06.334 --> 01:24:07.767
Press play, Andy.

01:24:09.304 --> 01:24:11.205
Teddy! Teddy!

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.499
Why are you hassling Mickie and Marta?

01:24:13.743 --> 01:24:15.836
What are they up to this time, Harry?

01:24:16.045 --> 01:24:19.446
What are you up to?
Spin me one of your stories.

01:24:19.649 --> 01:24:21.446
You stay away from them or else.

01:24:21.651 --> 01:24:24.586
How could you fuck
that faceless half-breed?

01:24:28.624 --> 01:24:29.921
No, no. Relax.

01:24:30.126 --> 01:24:32.356
You're a disgrace to that suit, Teddy.

01:24:33.863 --> 01:24:35.694
- Hey.
- Louisa.

01:24:38.134 --> 01:24:40.500
- There's something I must tell you.
- Okay.

01:24:40.803 --> 01:24:41.895
Lou.

01:24:42.138 --> 01:24:44.936
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

01:24:46.676 --> 01:24:47.870
Hello?

01:24:49.111 --> 01:24:50.544
Marta?

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:54.410
Yeah, it's Louisa. I can't hear you.

01:24:58.155 --> 01:25:00.055
I'll get... Okay.

01:25:00.991 --> 01:25:02.083
It's for you.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.862
It's me.

01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:16.196
<i>Oh, Harry. I need you. Please come.</i>

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:21.739
<i>It's Mickie. He...</i>

01:25:23.747 --> 01:25:24.941
Marta?

01:25:31.455 --> 01:25:33.753
- I've gotta go.
- So it's Marta?

01:25:33.957 --> 01:25:36.984
- All this time, under my nose.
- No, you don't understand.

01:25:37.195 --> 01:25:39.561
Oh, come on, Harry. Please.

01:25:40.098 --> 01:25:41.224
Be a man.

01:25:41.566 --> 01:25:44.433
- Well, if you love her, go.
- Yes, I do love her.

01:25:46.437 --> 01:25:48.496
But I've never made love to her.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.298
Get out.

01:25:51.242 --> 01:25:52.869
Get out!

01:25:55.913 --> 01:25:57.175
Harry.

01:25:59.584 --> 01:26:00.642
Harry!

01:26:14.132 --> 01:26:15.963
Oh, shit!

01:26:49.535 --> 01:26:52.265
Washington has agreed
that as we have the contacts...

01:26:52.471 --> 01:26:55.736
...that we should undertake
the financing and arming...

01:26:55.974 --> 01:26:57.839
...of the Silent Opposition.

01:26:58.043 --> 01:27:01.639
And it's been agreed that that task
be undertaken by an older hand.

01:27:01.881 --> 01:27:06.409
By myself, in fact. And on
a more formal basis than hitherto.

01:27:07.053 --> 01:27:10.318
I dare say that'll come
as a bit of a relief to you, Andrew.

01:27:10.523 --> 01:27:12.718
Equipping an army, tedious business.

01:27:12.926 --> 01:27:15.918
Not the sort of task
for your mercurial brain.

01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:18.757
Best left to us humble
planners and plodders, eh?

01:27:19.465 --> 01:27:23.832
It's fine in principle, Scotty.
Just one snag.

01:27:24.135 --> 01:27:25.966
They won't talk to anyone but me.

01:27:27.805 --> 01:27:30.273
I think you'll find that,
however shy they are...

01:27:30.508 --> 01:27:32.601
...they'll talk to a candid friend...

01:27:32.844 --> 01:27:35.312
...who has $15 million
to spend on them.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.707
Wouldn't you say, ambassador?

01:27:38.516 --> 01:27:41.610
You know, for quite a while
I was skeptical...

01:27:41.819 --> 01:27:45.085
...about this extraordinarily
silent opposition.

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:50.318
And I always thought that Mickie
Abraxas was just a harmless drunk.

01:27:50.796 --> 01:27:52.957
Funny how wrong you can be.

01:27:54.466 --> 01:27:59.199
Andy may have a real problem conjuring
up one of these people for you.

01:27:59.638 --> 01:28:02.971
Afraid so, Scotty.
You could put it like this:

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:07.110
If you don't go through me,
there is no Silent Opposition.

01:28:07.312 --> 01:28:09.507
It doesn't do to be too possessive.

01:28:09.715 --> 01:28:13.344
We must be brave and wean them off
the Osnard teat, my boy.

01:28:13.986 --> 01:28:18.389
Might I offer myself
as a go-between, so to speak...

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:22.219
...to verify Andy's dispersal
of these funds?

01:28:22.828 --> 01:28:25.525
Kind of you to offer, ambassador.
Perhaps so.

01:28:25.732 --> 01:28:28.633
Meanwhile, Andrew can brief me
on the details.

01:28:28.835 --> 01:28:30.769
We have a lot to catch up on, eh?

01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:34.133
Whiskey till the small hours
in the privacy of your abode...

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:37.275
...is indicated for Osnard
and Luxmore, I believe.

01:28:39.245 --> 01:28:41.270
- Sure.
- Excellent, gentlemen.

01:28:41.514 --> 01:28:44.745
Andrew, I take it you have
a secure safe in your apartment?

01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:46.441
Absolutely, sir.

01:28:46.719 --> 01:28:47.811
Fort Knox.

01:28:48.021 --> 01:28:49.318
Ambassador.

01:28:49.756 --> 01:28:51.121
I'll get my files.

01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:04.464
- You are getting out, aren't you?
- Possibly.

01:29:05.638 --> 01:29:07.368
Too early to say.

01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:09.308
You'll have to, won't you?

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.411
I mean, there is no
Silent Opposition, is there?

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.449
- Who told you that?
- You did, just now in the meeting.

01:29:17.751 --> 01:29:19.776
You made it all up, didn't you?

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:23.887
What are you talking about?

01:29:24.091 --> 01:29:27.322
I think you're the wickedest
human being I've ever met.

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.792
That was the attraction, wasn't it?

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.730
How about a farewell fuck?

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.762
Here in the office.

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:39.929
A knee-trembler.

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.777
You know, I think I'm cured.

01:29:47.214 --> 01:29:51.015
Excuse me, Francesca.
A private word with Andrew.

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:53.010
He's all yours.

01:29:55.890 --> 01:30:00.020
My duty is to inform
the Foreign Office of this...

01:30:00.295 --> 01:30:01.694
...travesty.

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:04.756
How much is your duty worth?

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.462
- Two million.
- One.

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:09.193
- One and a half.
- One and a quarter.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.598
Done.

01:30:11.373 --> 01:30:12.670
Andrew.

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.472
Good night.

01:30:42.538 --> 01:30:46.941
You got a lovely little family, Harry.
Only one thing can spoil it.

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.010
- What's that, Uncle Benny?
- The truth, Harry.

01:30:50.212 --> 01:30:51.645
That's the honest truth.

01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:01.413
Esmeralda?

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:03.213
Esmeralda.

01:31:05.928 --> 01:31:08.488
I'm going out. Watch the children.

01:31:09.632 --> 01:31:11.293
Marta!

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.635
Marta!

01:31:32.756 --> 01:31:34.949
Oh, God!

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.558
I'm not imposing on you, am I?

01:31:37.759 --> 01:31:40.193
You're not imposing
on me in the least.

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:44.592
Who the devil's that?

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:54.598
Buchan 2. We got trouble.

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:57.506
When I get her into
the other room, get out.

01:31:57.746 --> 01:32:00.044
In the lobby,
give the concierge a dollar.

01:32:00.249 --> 01:32:03.377
He'll get you a taxi to
the El Panama Hotel. Get a room.

01:32:03.586 --> 01:32:05.315
A taxi? At this time of night?

01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:08.354
I don't speak Spanish, Andy.
I'm unarmed.

01:32:08.557 --> 01:32:10.115
Life is cheap here.

01:32:10.326 --> 01:32:13.523
You can handle it.
You're a field man, aren't you?

01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:15.729
What about the bags?

01:32:15.931 --> 01:32:18.593
I'll guard them with my life.
Believe me.

01:32:44.427 --> 01:32:45.724
Louisa.

01:32:46.897 --> 01:32:50.355
- Something on your mind?
- What the fuck have you done?

01:32:50.667 --> 01:32:54.364
What is all this bullshit
about Abraxas and Delgado?

01:32:54.571 --> 01:32:57.540
Don't worry. It's nothing.
It's crap. It's all a game.

01:32:57.741 --> 01:32:59.368
- Where's Harry?
- Harry's okay.

01:32:59.576 --> 01:33:03.376
- I'm gonna take care of Harry and you.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

01:33:03.613 --> 01:33:05.342
Get off me.

01:33:08.952 --> 01:33:10.419
Relax.

01:33:11.121 --> 01:33:13.316
We both know why you're here.

01:33:18.628 --> 01:33:19.890
Yeah.

01:33:20.197 --> 01:33:22.758
Shit! You...

01:33:26.971 --> 01:33:29.303
What have you gotten Harry into?

01:33:29.507 --> 01:33:33.307
Harry got himself into this
with his own ludicrous stories.

01:33:33.744 --> 01:33:38.044
When the Americans take back their
canal, it'll be down to him, not me.

01:33:39.217 --> 01:33:40.206
When?

01:33:41.352 --> 01:33:42.319
When?

01:33:44.655 --> 01:33:46.452
Get out of my way!

01:33:50.127 --> 01:33:51.856
I killed him, Marta.

01:33:52.063 --> 01:33:54.531
I killed him with my bullshit.

01:33:55.399 --> 01:33:57.697
He said the police were after him.

01:33:57.902 --> 01:33:59.164
He said:

01:34:00.771 --> 01:34:02.762
"Tell Harry I'm sorry."

01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:05.635
And I didn't finish his suit.

01:34:06.478 --> 01:34:09.174
It would've given him
back his dignity.

01:34:09.815 --> 01:34:11.874
He wouldn't have shot himself in it.

01:34:12.117 --> 01:34:14.585
He was always going to do it.

01:34:16.555 --> 01:34:19.752
He was just looking
for a good enough excuse.

01:34:40.979 --> 01:34:42.879
Shall I close his eyes?

01:34:55.662 --> 01:34:57.630
You must go now, Harry.

01:34:58.998 --> 01:35:00.090
Go, Harry.

01:35:22.555 --> 01:35:23.522
Yep.

01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:25.881
Harry, my man, where have you been?

01:35:26.092 --> 01:35:30.291
Louisa was here. I think she thought
I was leading you astray or something.

01:35:33.334 --> 01:35:34.596
Jesus.

01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:37.637
I see. Go on.

01:35:38.138 --> 01:35:40.436
So we have to stop all this, you hear?

01:35:40.974 --> 01:35:44.569
Mickie knew nothing about it.
You know and I know I made it all up.

01:35:44.778 --> 01:35:47.872
<i>It's too late for that, old boy.
Out of our hands.</i>

01:35:48.515 --> 01:35:51.107
A case of life imitating art.

01:36:06.365 --> 01:36:08.128
Bit of a setback, sir.

01:36:08.333 --> 01:36:10.359
It's Mickie Abraxas.

01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:12.428
Bullet through the head.

01:36:13.439 --> 01:36:14.497
Suicide.

01:36:14.707 --> 01:36:17.904
Setback? Setback? On the contrary.

01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:21.603
No, they'll probably claim
he killed himself in police custody.

01:36:21.848 --> 01:36:25.841
That's standard euphemism for
assassinations in regimes of this ilk.

01:36:26.085 --> 01:36:28.417
No, no one's going
to swallow that one.

01:36:28.621 --> 01:36:29.588
<i>No.</i>

01:36:30.256 --> 01:36:34.283
<i>"Leader of the Democratic Rebel
Movement murdered."</i>

01:36:34.494 --> 01:36:38.430
<i>Yes. I think we could have
the peg we're looking for, Andy.</i>

01:36:38.631 --> 01:36:41.532
<i>I'll inform our American cousins.
Now, tell me...</i>

01:36:41.734 --> 01:36:44.931
<i>... did you manage to resolve
that Buchan 2 situation?</i>

01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:49.370
<i>I got the distinct impression
she was in a state of high anxiety.</i>

01:36:49.575 --> 01:36:54.411
<i>You must impress on your operatives
the importance of staying in control.</i>

01:36:54.648 --> 01:36:55.706
<i>Andrew?</i>

01:37:10.798 --> 01:37:13.824
Hello, is anybody there?
I must talk to the ambassador.

01:37:14.034 --> 01:37:15.092
I'm English.

01:37:15.302 --> 01:37:18.601
It's a matter of grave importance.

01:37:25.379 --> 01:37:28.837
Mickie Abraxas died three hours ago.

01:37:29.049 --> 01:37:32.109
Executed by a government death squad.

01:37:32.753 --> 01:37:35.018
I have informed the president.

01:37:35.223 --> 01:37:37.783
He has authorized us to go on in.

01:37:37.992 --> 01:37:41.519
We have that right under the treaty
if the canal is threatened.

01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:45.322
Operation Straight Arrow
is all yours, general.

01:37:45.533 --> 01:37:47.296
How soon can you be operational?

01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:50.596
- Give me four hours, sir.
- That fast?

01:37:51.039 --> 01:37:54.805
My rapid response units
are on full alert, sir.

01:37:55.009 --> 01:37:58.103
<i>Carrier Alaska is
off the coast of Panama.</i>

01:37:58.313 --> 01:38:01.180
Eight F-22 Raptors are on alert.

01:38:01.416 --> 01:38:04.908
Twelve gunships.
A battalion of marines.

01:38:06.421 --> 01:38:09.720
- I've got to speak to the ambassador.
- The ambassador is busy.

01:38:09.924 --> 01:38:11.824
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

01:38:12.026 --> 01:38:13.516
Ambassador.

01:38:14.028 --> 01:38:15.928
I am Buchan.

01:38:16.231 --> 01:38:20.794
I made it all up. You've got
to stop it. You see, I'm Buchan.

01:38:21.003 --> 01:38:23.972
I'm sorry, but aren't you
that tailor fellow?

01:38:24.173 --> 01:38:25.504
You're rather upset.

01:38:25.708 --> 01:38:28.575
- Nigel, please show the gentleman out.
- Yes.

01:38:28.777 --> 01:38:31.473
There is no Silent Opposition!

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.615
Someone's gotta blow the whistle.
Might as well be me.

01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:38.809
You're a diplomat. Be diplomatic.
Can't interfere at this stage.

01:38:39.054 --> 01:38:41.921
It would reflect very badly.
And what could we say?

01:38:42.124 --> 01:38:47.061
That some deranged tailor Johnny
told us it was all a joke?

01:38:47.263 --> 01:38:48.287
Nevertheless.

01:38:54.236 --> 01:38:56.898
- Darling, what...?
- I need to talk to Ernesto.

01:39:04.447 --> 01:39:05.277
Andy.

01:39:14.524 --> 01:39:15.456
Andy!

01:39:20.597 --> 01:39:21.689
Wait!

01:39:34.344 --> 01:39:35.743
Oh, Harry.

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:52.058
Well, if the ambassador's
been recalled...

01:39:52.263 --> 01:39:54.663
...give me somebody
who hasn't been recalled.

01:39:54.865 --> 01:39:57.993
His secretary, his butler, his...

01:40:00.071 --> 01:40:01.698
Come with me, Louisa.

01:40:02.771 --> 01:40:04.796
We're going to see the president.

01:40:17.419 --> 01:40:18.886
Shit!

01:40:23.525 --> 01:40:25.426
Oh, no, no, no.

01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:28.063
Come on, come on, come on.

01:41:10.341 --> 01:41:12.275
What the fuck do you want?

01:41:12.476 --> 01:41:17.209
I want you to come back to the embassy
and tell them it's all a mistake!

01:41:17.948 --> 01:41:21.440
Harry, I've got our money here.
Yours and mine.

01:41:21.686 --> 01:41:24.450
I'm trying to get out
before they close the airport.

01:41:24.689 --> 01:41:28.853
I'm going straight to Switzerland.
Open numbered accounts for both of us.

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.754
You'll be a rich man.
Just give me a lift.

01:41:31.962 --> 01:41:33.987
- We're going back.
- Get out of my way!

01:41:34.198 --> 01:41:37.895
- Are you not listening to me?
- Don't be bloody annoying, Harry!

01:41:39.804 --> 01:41:42.637
Shit! They're here.

01:42:05.630 --> 01:42:06.688
Ambassador!

01:42:08.667 --> 01:42:12.763
Will you vouch for me, my credentials?
I need to get on a plane.

01:42:12.971 --> 01:42:15.565
You wish for this man to be included?

01:42:15.774 --> 01:42:17.742
I've never seen him before.

01:42:19.978 --> 01:42:21.343
Ambassador.

01:42:25.484 --> 01:42:29.545
As you can see, the airport is closed,
but palms have been greased.

01:42:29.788 --> 01:42:34.692
And once our arrangement
has been concluded...

01:42:35.261 --> 01:42:37.229
...you'll be free to go.

01:42:52.779 --> 01:42:57.239
It is a fabrication, Mr. President.
A pack of lies, a travesty.

01:42:57.450 --> 01:43:01.682
The canal is safe, secure.
Unthreatened.

01:43:01.921 --> 01:43:03.889
Call off your dogs, sir.

01:43:04.123 --> 01:43:05.750
Call them off.

01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:13.490
I'll walk you to your plane.

01:43:17.037 --> 01:43:20.006
Could this be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

01:43:20.207 --> 01:43:22.869
I think it desperately unlikely.

01:43:27.447 --> 01:43:30.678
<i>Mission aborted. Return to base.</i>

01:43:43.764 --> 01:43:44.890
Why?

01:43:45.566 --> 01:43:47.124
I don't know.

01:43:48.869 --> 01:43:50.496
I thought it was a game.

01:43:50.704 --> 01:43:52.638
And behind my back?

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.708
All those lies about
the president and Delgado?

01:43:56.177 --> 01:43:58.611
Oh, yes, the lies.

01:43:59.581 --> 01:44:02.448
I'm very, very sorry about the lies.

01:44:06.521 --> 01:44:07.783
Louisa...

01:44:08.556 --> 01:44:11.218
I never did work in Savile Row, did I?

01:44:11.459 --> 01:44:12.926
Not as such.

01:44:13.795 --> 01:44:16.093
I learned the tailoring in prison.

01:44:16.762 --> 01:44:20.163
I burnt down my Uncle Benny's
warehouse to help him out.

01:44:20.366 --> 01:44:22.391
And then, when I'd done my time...

01:44:22.969 --> 01:44:25.836
...Uncle Benny,
he gives me my portion...

01:44:26.806 --> 01:44:29.570
...sends me out here
so I can't get into trouble.

01:44:30.843 --> 01:44:33.311
I pretended he was Arthur Braithwaite.

01:44:38.785 --> 01:44:41.413
You see, lying's what
you do in prison, Lou.

01:44:42.389 --> 01:44:44.448
It's instead of love, really.

01:44:44.892 --> 01:44:48.623
You tell it the way it should be
since that's better than how it is...

01:44:48.829 --> 01:44:50.262
...when it's that bad.

01:44:50.497 --> 01:44:51.964
If you follow me.

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.596
Why didn't you just tell me
from the start?

01:44:58.338 --> 01:45:01.603
Because I fell in love
with you, my princess.

01:45:04.311 --> 01:45:07.144
And I knew that I wasn't
good enough for you.

01:45:08.682 --> 01:45:10.240
Not as I stood.

01:45:12.886 --> 01:45:15.616
Harry, you are such a fool.

01:45:17.791 --> 01:45:22.252
Dad, you promised to tell me a story.
Where were you?

01:45:23.164 --> 01:45:24.631
Oh, Sarah.

01:45:25.533 --> 01:45:27.091
I'm so sorry.

01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:32.635
No need to cry about it, Dad.

01:45:33.875 --> 01:45:35.069
Hi, Dad.

01:45:35.276 --> 01:45:36.504
Hi, Mum.

01:45:40.148 --> 01:45:42.207
So, what do you want me to do?

01:45:44.552 --> 01:45:46.417
What do I want you to do?

01:45:47.889 --> 01:45:49.481
What you always do.

01:45:54.162 --> 01:45:55.652
Make breakfast.

01:45:59.033 --> 01:46:01.126
Can we have pancakes?

01:46:03.038 --> 01:46:05.063
- Yeah.
- You want pancakes?

01:46:05.741 --> 01:46:07.072
Breakfast?

01:46:19.355 --> 01:46:23.314
Well, there's two ways we can deal
with this one, my dear.

01:46:23.525 --> 01:46:24.514
Ready?
