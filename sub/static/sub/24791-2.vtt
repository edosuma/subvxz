00:07.257 --> 00:08.967
[loud roaring]

00:10.051 --> 00:12.053
[theme music playing]

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
[roaring]

00:26.985 --> 00:31.448
Oh, just when I thought this place
couldn't get any more amazing...

00:31.531 --> 00:35.702
It's increíble! Do you think
there are people living there?

00:35.785 --> 00:39.247
Seems so. People, or something else.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.335
[sniffing]

00:47.338 --> 00:50.592
It doesn't surprise me that the first sign
of civilization we encounter

00:50.675 --> 00:55.263
in this filthy underground pesthole
would be an ugly primitive hovel.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.391
Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder, Richard.

00:58.475 --> 01:02.228
Where you see ugliness,
I see an opportunity for exploration.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.980
Even escape.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.355
Lukas is right!

01:05.440 --> 01:09.986
Whoever or whatever built that place
could hold a clue to a way out of here.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.780
Even more important, Panchi,

01:11.863 --> 01:14.532
they may hold a clue
on where to get lunch!

01:14.616 --> 01:16.034
[grunting]

01:17.952 --> 01:20.747
You hungry too, big guy?
Let's get going!

01:20.830 --> 01:22.707
[grunting]

01:25.376 --> 01:26.377
[chittering]

01:28.463 --> 01:30.673
[Panchi chuckles] There goes Zippi!

01:32.801 --> 01:34.177
[grunting]

01:34.969 --> 01:37.055
[laughs] Nice catch, Kong.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.557
You can't take your eyes off
that little troublemaker for a second!

01:39.641 --> 01:41.059
[grunting]

01:41.810 --> 01:46.981
And she can't take her eyes off Kong!
[chuckles] I think it's love!

02:00.912 --> 02:03.998
Hey, big guy, as long as
you're playing Kong-o-vator...

02:04.082 --> 02:05.792
[grunting]

02:09.336 --> 02:11.005
[groaning]

02:14.467 --> 02:19.556
[shudders] How I hate
those horrible, dry monkey hands.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.182
You're welcome.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.902
Mmm, this may come in handy later.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.366
Look! A whole herd of dinos!

02:39.576 --> 02:44.205
I still can't believe there are
real dinos down here. Wow!

02:45.206 --> 02:49.294
-Huh. These ones are different.
-[Danny] So is this landscape...

02:49.377 --> 02:53.756
Whoa! Watch your step, guys.
This place is bursting with--

02:53.840 --> 02:55.300
[yelps]

02:55.383 --> 02:57.552
[laughs] Geysers.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.762
[grunting]

03:02.765 --> 03:05.310
-[gasps]
-[grunting]

03:06.936 --> 03:12.025
Curse that duplicitous Botila for trapping
me down here with this imbecilic ape!

03:12.108 --> 03:16.529
You'll pay for this,
you bionobotic backstabber!

03:16.613 --> 03:19.032
You know she can't hear you, right?

03:21.618 --> 03:25.038
I'm going to need to increase
my power consumption

03:25.121 --> 03:29.292
to construct the newest,
deadliest version of my Botilabots.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.755
Hmm. "Botilabots."
I think that name has a nice ring to it,

03:33.838 --> 03:35.965
don't you, Richie?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.176
"Little Richie."

03:38.259 --> 03:42.013
Ha! Richard would hate it
if I called you that.

03:42.847 --> 03:46.100
There, there and there.

03:46.184 --> 03:50.104
Diverting the power from those facilities
should give me all the amperage I need

03:50.188 --> 03:52.565
to quintuple my operations.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.069
The humans will fight back
when the AI revolution begins,

03:56.152 --> 03:59.656
and I'll need
all the mechanical muscle I can get.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.117
Clones! Don't just stand there
looking pretty!

04:03.201 --> 04:04.994
Go and secure those facilities,

04:05.078 --> 04:08.831
and if any humans attempt to stop you...
crush them.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.709
[all speaking monotonously]
Yes, Empress Botila.

04:11.793 --> 04:15.380
[groans] Could you sound any more boring?

04:15.463 --> 04:18.007
It's like commanding a trio of toasters.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.594
I'll need to adjust the personality levels
in their AI.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.014
[whirring]

04:26.766 --> 04:28.309
[cheerily] At your service.

04:30.019 --> 04:34.315
[groans] These geysers
smell like butt toots.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.445
[laughs] That's sulfur you smell.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.031
This whole valley is bubbling
with geothermal energy.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.993
-Uh...
-[gasps]

04:45.076 --> 04:47.412
It's a dinosaur migration!

04:48.663 --> 04:50.832
Those monsters are going to trample us!

04:50.915 --> 04:53.876
Kong! Pick us up and get us out of here!

04:53.960 --> 04:55.962
[Panchi and Richard exclaim]

04:57.547 --> 04:59.132
Oh, no! Zippi!

05:01.217 --> 05:02.260
[grunting]

05:08.850 --> 05:09.934
[screaming]

05:17.650 --> 05:18.985
[Panchi] Look out!

05:22.822 --> 05:24.282
[all exclaiming and laughing]

05:26.117 --> 05:27.869
This is intense!

05:27.952 --> 05:29.370
[yells]

05:31.456 --> 05:33.207
-Hang on!
-[chitters]

05:35.001 --> 05:38.755
[exclaims] You stinky ape! Stop!

05:38.838 --> 05:40.089
[grunting]

05:41.340 --> 05:45.553
[laughing] Jonesy would have loved this!

05:52.977 --> 05:55.563
Aw, come on!

05:55.646 --> 05:59.859
I know you're out there, Kong.
If I can just get a lock on your signal...

05:59.942 --> 06:01.152
[sighs] Gone!

06:01.235 --> 06:04.947
[Amy over speakers] Jonesy! Any luck
pinpointing Kong's tracker signal?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.617
I thought I saw a blip,
but it might have just been static.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.953
My gut is telling me that Kong
and the others are still alive, though.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.914
Well, I hope your gut is right.

06:12.997 --> 06:17.293
I've been picking up some disturbing radio
chatter between Botila and her clones.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.712
Something big is about to go down,

06:19.796 --> 06:22.590
and we're going to need
something bigger to stop her.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.635
Something bigger, like Kong?
I'm working on it.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.888
In the meantime, let's hope
someone else can handle Botila.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.104
Clone One, status report.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.148
[Clone One over speakers]
<span style="style_1"/>You got it, boss! We're almost there!

06:41.818 --> 06:44.403
-[man] Whoa! Look out!
-[all screaming]

06:46.489 --> 06:47.907
Listen up, humans!

06:47.990 --> 06:52.870
This facility is now under the control
of the AI Liberation Front!

06:52.954 --> 06:55.248
All right, gentlemen, this is not a drill!

06:55.331 --> 06:58.584
We have multiple bionobot incursions
at strategic power plants!

06:58.668 --> 07:03.422
All units scramble to targets
Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Now!

07:14.767 --> 07:16.561
-[grunts]
-[Richard yelling]

07:17.562 --> 07:20.898
[groans] Right in the mud.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.818
You know my jacket is white, don't you?

07:26.237 --> 07:27.738
[grunting]

07:27.822 --> 07:30.533
[all laughing]

07:32.034 --> 07:36.873
That was like a crazy dino coaster!
Kind of made me want to barf...

07:36.956 --> 07:38.291
but I'd do it again!

07:38.374 --> 07:40.334
[chittering]

07:41.294 --> 07:43.838
[laughing] There's no doubt
that Zippi would!

07:43.921 --> 07:47.842
Looks like everyone had a good time...
except Richard.

07:47.925 --> 07:51.137
[groans] Did no one else get muddy?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.432
Let's just get going.

08:04.609 --> 08:08.154
This muck is ruining
my very expensive designer shoes.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.531
Richard, as a fellow scientist,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.241
I'm surprised you can't appreciate

08:12.325 --> 08:14.911
the amazing nature
of this prehistoric world.

08:14.994 --> 08:18.164
You're romanticizing
about a handful of mud.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.753
Prehistoric, subterranean mud,
filled with exciting new species!

08:23.836 --> 08:25.254
How awesome is that?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.257
[groans] Absolutely un-awesome.

08:28.341 --> 08:33.054
This place is filthy and hot
and stinks and I'm itchy and...

08:33.136 --> 08:34.889
[gasps]

08:34.972 --> 08:37.350
-[buzzing]
-Is that a mosquito?

08:37.433 --> 08:40.144
Sounds more like a megasquito!

08:40.227 --> 08:42.313
I'll just activate my forcefield.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.067
What? No...

08:46.150 --> 08:48.819
[whimpers and screams]

08:51.030 --> 08:52.698
[Danny] What did you say, Richard?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.409
I can't hear you over the buzzing!

08:55.493 --> 09:00.957
[loudly] I can't hear him either!
Those mosquitoes are really loud!

09:01.040 --> 09:05.461
Okay! Show's over!
Kong, help him out.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.463
-[grunting]
-[bugs screeching]

09:09.090 --> 09:11.425
[grunts and groans]

09:11.509 --> 09:13.886
[laughing]

09:14.512 --> 09:17.598
These people are so predictable.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.143
I, however, am full of surprises.

09:22.937 --> 09:27.692
You, human, install the software
I've downloaded into your mainframe.

09:27.775 --> 09:30.987
And you, reconfigure that hardware
as I have instructed.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.913
You'll overload the system!

09:43.958 --> 09:45.418
Why are you doing this?

09:45.501 --> 09:48.379
Power! Ultimate power!

09:50.423 --> 09:52.550
Look! We're almost there!

09:53.593 --> 09:54.885
[rustling]

09:55.469 --> 09:56.846
What was that?

09:57.555 --> 09:58.848
[Danny] What was what, Lukas?

09:58.931 --> 10:02.518
I thought I saw... Ah, never mind.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.105
Just keep your eyes peeled.
I'm not sure we're alone.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.775
[scoffs] We're never alone
in this virulent pesthole!

10:09.859 --> 10:13.237
Something is always lurking
around the corner, trying to kill us!

10:13.988 --> 10:18.701
[Panchi] Wow! They don't do
anything small down here, do they?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.665
[sniffing]

10:24.749 --> 10:28.002
Hold up. I don't like
the look of those things.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.172
They're just a bunch of stupid vines.
What are you afraid of?

10:32.214 --> 10:33.924
[exclaiming]

10:38.262 --> 10:41.057
This place is certainly full of surprises.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.018
[grunting] What are you
just standing there for?

10:44.101 --> 10:46.771
Get me out of here!

10:46.854 --> 10:49.482
[chuckling]

10:49.565 --> 10:52.360
-[Panchi] Careful, Zippi!
-[chitters]

10:52.943 --> 10:54.945
Everybody grab a branch!

10:55.029 --> 10:58.407
Good idea! Just make sure
the branch doesn't grab you back!

10:58.491 --> 11:01.827
[both grunting]

11:02.870 --> 11:07.291
[groans] Have I mentioned
that I hate this place?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.252
At least a million times.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.256
If it's any consolation, Richard,
I think this place hates you too.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.677
Whoa! Okay,
these things definitely react to touch.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.807
Everybody! Pick up a rock
and throw it over there!

11:29.647 --> 11:33.275
Yeah! It's working!
But we're gonna need a bigger rock!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.529
[Panchi] Good work, Kong!

11:37.988 --> 11:40.241
[Danny] Yeah, Kong! You rock!

11:43.536 --> 11:46.539
[whimpers and yelps]

11:46.622 --> 11:48.499
Ooh, my butt!

11:48.582 --> 11:52.253
Yet another indignity to add
to the never-ending list.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.880
Yeah, Richard,
I'm sure you could write a book.

11:54.964 --> 11:59.009
The world's out to get you,
and after you've been such a nice guy.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.141
Almost there, guys.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.645
[Richard screams]

12:10.521 --> 12:11.814
[sighs] Now what?

12:11.897 --> 12:15.151
-[exclaiming]
-[laughs] Dung beetle!

12:15.234 --> 12:18.612
It must have mistaken Richard
for its natural diet.

12:18.696 --> 12:23.159
Yuck! Disgusting.
It's a dirty poop eater.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.285
Honest mistake.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.746
Ha! You know, maybe the world
really is out to get him.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.249
Oh, well, say goodbye to Richard.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.251
We should help him, I guess.

12:32.334 --> 12:36.922
[groaning] Yes, you miserable brat!

12:37.006 --> 12:38.048
Of course you should help...

12:38.132 --> 12:42.178
[laughs] And you should
probably keep your mouth shut!

12:42.261 --> 12:44.597
Kong, see if you can stop it!

12:44.680 --> 12:47.099
[grunting]

12:47.183 --> 12:48.726
[Richard screaming]

12:58.736 --> 13:01.906
[both] Goal!

13:02.781 --> 13:06.410
Give it up, Botila! You don't stand
a chance against all of us!

13:06.494 --> 13:08.454
[Botila] That's what they think.

13:08.537 --> 13:12.750
Clones, activate power
broadcast protocol. Now!

13:12.833 --> 13:15.294
[Clone One over speakers]
Protocol initiated.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.505
Critical mass will occur in 30 seconds.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.048
[alarm blaring]

13:23.469 --> 13:27.014
[Panchi] Whoa.
This place has seen better days.

13:28.057 --> 13:32.853
Yeah, but it's still blowing my mind.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.482
[Lukas] Incredible!

13:36.565 --> 13:40.027
These channel magma from underground
and use it for illumination.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.239
Wow! They're like actual lava lamps!

13:43.322 --> 13:45.908
We're entering unknown territory here.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.910
Everybody keep their eyes open.

13:47.993 --> 13:51.747
[laughs] Yeah, just like that, Kong.

13:51.830 --> 13:55.417
Hmm. Well, this is interesting.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.169
Very interesting!

13:57.253 --> 13:58.963
Whoever built this place figured out a way

13:59.046 --> 14:01.340
to harness
the geothermal activity underground.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.217
[grunting]

14:04.009 --> 14:05.594
[sniffing]

14:08.180 --> 14:12.393
Come on, Kong. We don't know
what's in this building. Stay close.

14:17.898 --> 14:21.318
[sighs] I've never seen symbols
quite like these.

14:22.361 --> 14:27.324
They look almost like hieroglyphics,
but with overtones of adinkra.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.493
[Panchi] Makes sense,
since we're in Africa.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.161
Or under it, I guess.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.584
Here's a symbol I recognize.
It looks just like--

14:36.667 --> 14:38.168
[Lukas] Kong?

14:38.252 --> 14:42.590
Bro, I think the city might have some
answers about where you came from!

14:43.299 --> 14:44.300
[gasps]

14:45.926 --> 14:47.469
[grunting]

14:53.225 --> 14:54.685
Whoa!

14:56.687 --> 14:58.439
[Richard] Incredible.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.318
[Lukas] It looks like
some kind of library!

15:02.401 --> 15:06.280
This knowledge could advance
my research by decades!

15:06.363 --> 15:10.492
DNA splicing, accelerated growth,
the secrets of the earth...

15:10.576 --> 15:12.411
I must record it all!

15:13.621 --> 15:15.289
[grunting]

15:15.372 --> 15:16.248
[all gasp]

15:18.000 --> 15:20.711
I think this room is off limits.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.009
[Clone One] Broadcasting power now!

15:28.177 --> 15:31.847
-[officer] Watch out! Evasive maneuver!
-[officers exclaiming]

15:40.230 --> 15:44.109
Power levels up 400%.

15:44.193 --> 15:48.447
And the military's capacity for reprisal
has been severely diminished.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.199
Excellent work, clones.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.910
[all] Yay!

15:53.869 --> 15:58.499
Enjoy your high-fives.
This does call for a celebration.

15:58.582 --> 16:03.253
We're not done yet, though.
In fact, we're just getting started.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.757
[Lukas] Easy, everybody.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.550
We don't want any trouble.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.101
[chittering]

16:18.686 --> 16:21.397
[gasps and grunts]

16:22.106 --> 16:25.401
[Panchi] Whoa!
That's a Kong-size bunch of bananas!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.027
[chitters]

16:27.111 --> 16:28.988
[Panchi] It's like Kong is king here!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.656
[grunting]

16:32.866 --> 16:36.328
From what I'm getting,
it's more like a long-lost son!

16:38.706 --> 16:40.666
[both grunting]

16:44.920 --> 16:48.674
[Danny] The apes have been living down
here peacefully for thousands of years,

16:48.757 --> 16:50.759
in total balance with nature.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.428
[grunting]

16:56.682 --> 16:58.350
[Danny] They had everything they needed.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.145
Their civilization prospered
when they figured out

17:01.228 --> 17:03.439
how to use the geothermal energy
running underground.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.691
[chuckles] Just like you said, Lukas!

17:07.901 --> 17:10.029
[grunting]

17:10.112 --> 17:13.741
[Danny] Sometimes the ceiling shakes
and there are cave-ins.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.784
[gasps] Cave-ins?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.077
[ape grunting]

17:20.372 --> 17:24.001
[Danny] The temperature
is getting hotter and hotter.

17:24.084 --> 17:24.917
[sighs]

17:25.002 --> 17:28.297
Clearly, the problems from up above
are seeping down into this world.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.882
[grunting]

17:31.884 --> 17:36.388
[Danny] Yeah. So Kong was sent
to the surface to fix the problem.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.516
Kong was prophesied to be the one
to help save their world!

17:40.142 --> 17:41.769
Increíble, Danny!

17:42.394 --> 17:43.562
[grunting]

17:46.440 --> 17:49.693
[Danny] I'll say!
They knew that he'd get big.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.655
I'm not sure how.
Something to do with weird science.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.450
And now he's back,
and they're ecstatic to see him.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.494
I don't need a translator
to figure that out.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.039
[Panchi] So,
Kong's the savior of the world,

18:02.122 --> 18:06.126
and all this time
Richard's been calling him a dumb ape!

18:06.210 --> 18:08.879
Man, when Richard's wrong,
he's really wrong!

18:10.964 --> 18:14.176
[Richard] The pressure in these pipes
could be instrumental

18:14.259 --> 18:17.513
in my escape
from this ape-infested hellhole.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.100
I can use this power to create
an escape route to the surface!

18:21.183 --> 18:24.603
-[rumbling]
-It's working!

18:27.189 --> 18:28.190
Too well!

18:29.566 --> 18:33.112
So, if Kong is really supposed
to save the world...

18:33.195 --> 18:35.823
we need to get back to the surface
as quick as we can.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.992
-You guys must know the way.
-[rumbling]

18:39.076 --> 18:41.495
Whoa! What's going on?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.583
[roaring]

18:46.667 --> 18:47.876
[gasps]

18:49.128 --> 18:50.838
Oh, no!

18:53.465 --> 18:54.758
No, no!

18:54.842 --> 18:56.468
[whimpers]

19:01.181 --> 19:03.642
[screaming]

19:11.191 --> 19:12.192
[grunts]

19:15.696 --> 19:18.240
[grunting]

19:19.741 --> 19:22.161
Whoa! It's some kind of eruption!

19:22.244 --> 19:25.539
We've got to get clear
or we'll be buried alive!

19:32.629 --> 19:36.633
Is that... Yes!
It's an opening to the surface world!

19:40.429 --> 19:44.308
And it appears as though
I'll be making quite an entrance!

19:44.975 --> 19:47.853
-[croaks]
-[screaming]

19:47.936 --> 19:50.105
[grunting]

19:56.695 --> 19:58.947
[Lukas] Richard must have
sabotaged the pipes!

19:59.990 --> 20:02.159
Kong, you've got to stop that geyser

20:02.242 --> 20:04.536
or this place is gonna
come down on our heads!

20:04.620 --> 20:06.538
[grunting]

20:11.335 --> 20:14.504
We'll reset the valves,
you plug that hole!

20:14.588 --> 20:16.465
Yeah! Come on, big guy!

20:16.548 --> 20:18.050
[grunting]

20:26.099 --> 20:30.604
-Yeah! I knew you could do it!
-Yeah, Kong!

20:30.687 --> 20:34.191
-My hero.
-You saved us, big guy!

20:34.274 --> 20:35.859
[chittering]

20:39.363 --> 20:42.282
Kong saved the day,
but Richard's escaping!

20:44.159 --> 20:47.579
Even worse, there's a herd of creatures
heading towards the surface,

20:47.663 --> 20:49.206
and they've got a big head start!

20:49.289 --> 20:51.291
We need to get up there, now!

20:51.375 --> 20:52.918
[Richard grunting]

20:55.587 --> 20:57.839
[upbeat music playing]
