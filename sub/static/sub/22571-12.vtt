00:02.803 --> 00:04.872
- Ooh. That's a model walk.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.140
- That's not a model walk.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.941
That's--you got something
stuck in there.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.277
- No, you gotta
sling 'em, Kenny.,,

00:09.377 --> 00:10.844
- That's an inmate walk.
- Like, boom, boom, boom.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.113
- Oh, wow.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.381
You got something
in your prison wallet,

00:13.481 --> 00:14.882
and you're holding it.
- Huh.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.486
Let me get some of that.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.454
- Oh, it's gonna fall out!
Y'all crazy.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.790
What you know about
prison wallets, girl?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.028
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:28.129 --> 00:30.398
- Take a good look at this one.

00:30.498 --> 00:31.899
announcer:
The treasures within...

- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:38.372 --> 00:39.807
- You shut your face.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.975
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.144
- We're back, baby!

00:46.280 --> 00:49.250
- Lately, I've been
a little loose with my number,

00:49.350 --> 00:53.454
so today, I bought me
and myself a calculator,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.789
and I'ma be precise
with this here stuff.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.091
As my aunt told me,

00:57.191 --> 00:59.059
"Everything got to do
with the numbers."

00:59.160 --> 01:02.029
I usually rely on my voodoo
beans to bring me good luck,

01:02.130 --> 01:05.566
but today, I'm taking luck
all out of the equation.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.501
That's how they start off
on "Sesame Street."

01:07.601 --> 01:09.303
"Two! Two number."

01:09.403 --> 01:10.971
But yeah, I'ma figure it out.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.341
I'm about to make
my aunt proud.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.577
- We gonna get
all the small units...

01:16.677 --> 01:18.346
- 'Cause we don't like
big units.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.813
- 'Cause we don't.
But in life...

01:19.913 --> 01:20.948
- We don't like
the little unit.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.916
But in life, we do.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.552
- But we like small things
in a unit.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.187
We like big things in life.
- But not in life.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.821
- But we like--

01:27.921 --> 01:29.590
- We do!
- We do.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.193
- We're looking for big money
in little lockers.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.261
- But so are a lot of buyers,

01:33.361 --> 01:35.229
so we're gonna
have to be in sync.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.232
- We got to talk.
- Like this.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.967
Like that?
- Like this. Like this.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.203
Kay, but I'ma be like this
right now, because I'm driving.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.474
*

01:46.574 --> 01:48.376
Hello.
- Good Lord almighty...

01:49.677 --> 01:51.745
- We got some cougars
around here!

01:51.845 --> 01:54.182
Cougar land!

01:54.282 --> 01:55.883
I'm gonna check my car,
see if I got some nicks.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.451
I'ma catch me some cougars.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.522
- I don't even know--

02:01.622 --> 02:03.457
I don't even know
what to say to that, Kenny.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.993
Whoa!

02:06.093 --> 02:07.795
- We stopped and got some
fireworks on the way here,

02:07.895 --> 02:10.764
because, I mean,
do I really need a reason?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.401
- Kenny!

02:13.501 --> 02:15.068
Hello, everybody!
- Ivy!

02:15.169 --> 02:16.103
- Are you going to
a job interview?

02:16.204 --> 02:17.238
- Ivy, my man,
what's happening?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.606
- Hey, Brandi!

02:18.706 --> 02:20.007
Whoo!
- Hello, sir.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.542
- You dress for
the job you want,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.177
and my job is winning lockers.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.745
You look like you about to--

02:24.845 --> 02:26.046
- Doesn't he feel like
he 'bout to pull 'em?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.548
He 'bout to go out
and pull 'em tonight.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.617
- Y'all, hey--

02:29.717 --> 02:31.519
This auction is seriously,
like, possessed.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.987
- Everybody get a locker day!
Ho, ho, ho!

02:34.087 --> 02:35.623
- That's funny,
I don't remember

02:35.723 --> 02:37.691
buying a ticket to crazy town.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.593
- Hey, I see myself there.
Damn, I look good.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.161
Ooh, yeah.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.232
*

02:44.332 --> 02:45.833
- This is gonna be
an interesting auction.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.435
- I'm excited.
- All righty, guys,

02:47.535 --> 02:48.902
thank you so much
for coming out today

02:49.002 --> 02:50.604
to my self-storage.
My name is Emily.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.373
I'm gonna be
your auctioneer today.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.874
We have 11 units to sell.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.143
Once I open the door,
you guys can all look inside,

02:56.244 --> 02:57.745
but you won't be able
to touch anything.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.079
It's a cash-only auction.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.514
If you guys are ready
to see what we have,

03:00.614 --> 03:01.915
so am I! Let's go!

03:02.015 --> 03:03.484
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ow!

03:03.584 --> 03:05.018
- This way, guys!

03:06.554 --> 03:09.122
Here we go, guys,
first unit of the day!

03:09.223 --> 03:10.891
*

03:10.991 --> 03:12.993
- Dust bunnies.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.195
- Stripper or
a professional female golfer?

03:15.296 --> 03:16.830
Sexy golfer.
- Yeah, sexy golfer.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.667
That's how she got
all those trophies.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.903
- I don't know
what kinda unit this is.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.372
I know it just ain't for me.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.539
- Come on, girls, we got
a lot of units to get through.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.674
- All right.
- Oh. Oh...

03:26.774 --> 03:28.175
- We got two cougars,
two cougars up.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.843
- "Hm, it's not gonna fit
in our fanny pack."

03:29.943 --> 03:32.413
- Mm-kay,
"Secret Conversations."

03:32.513 --> 03:34.282
She's a conversationalist.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.949
- That explains
the bikini tops.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.918
See, she knows how to
communicate with her body.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.454
We need this. Done.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.590
- A lot of awards
was given in this unit,

03:42.690 --> 03:44.525
but I'm liking
this tote right here.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.527
This locker's
a little bit clean

03:46.627 --> 03:48.228
and a little bit dirty,

03:48.329 --> 03:49.863
just like me.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.064
How long that unit's
been in here?

03:51.164 --> 03:52.433
- I don't know, sorry.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.034
All right, here we go.
First unit of the day,

03:54.134 --> 03:56.236
the golfer unit.
- Oh! Shade!

03:57.671 --> 03:58.739
What's in the tote?

03:58.839 --> 04:00.674
Y'all don't know
what's in the tote, huh?

04:00.774 --> 04:01.809
No.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.413
- Yeah.
- She ain't going fast.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.880
It's just in your mind.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.549
--100.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.651
- She's going so fast.
- I know.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.287
It's already more than we even
wanted to pay for this locker.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.691
- Yeah.
- 110, 125, 135.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.893
And 135, and 150.
--175.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.595
And 175
- 200!

04:21.695 --> 04:23.997
- 200 now.
225

04:24.097 --> 04:26.266
250.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.868
Sold it to ya. $225.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.170
Kenny got it for $225.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.739
- Man!
- Kenny!

04:32.973 --> 04:34.308
- After doing the numbers,

04:34.408 --> 04:37.345
there's a 90% chance
I won't regret buying this.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.712
I know everybody thought

04:38.812 --> 04:41.715
I would be looking at
these here underwears.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.017
Ain't gonna make no money
on this right here.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.019
Trash!
What we got here?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.255
What is this? ProRoller.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.491
Guess you lay it on the floor
and you roll with it.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.926
Maybe I could straighten up
my situ-ma-wation right now.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.028
Let's see.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.530
Oh, , what was that?

04:56.630 --> 04:57.731
That was my back.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.367
I just heard
something go click.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.901
I'm keeping this for myself.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.936
ProRoller, I love you.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.906
What the hell cracked?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.240
Oh, man!

05:07.341 --> 05:09.309
He blew up on me.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.044
Oh, my--

05:11.144 --> 05:13.447
Well, it was a price to pay.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.815
ProRoller won.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.717
Sorry.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.687
"The Confident Woman."

05:19.787 --> 05:22.390
A dollar? Ha! Boom!

05:22.490 --> 05:23.591
Check this.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.626
I'm gonna play
the lotto with this.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.194
Low-key empty.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.496
All I gotta do is put a--

05:28.596 --> 05:30.398
Hello Kitty sticker
right there.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.265
$25.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.468
I'd probably get about $10
for the suitcase.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.169
What is this?

05:36.269 --> 05:37.304
Look at that.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.540
Fancy ass pens with a feather.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.809
They write all them bounce
checks with this fancy .

05:41.909 --> 05:43.444
It looks good in your office.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.212
It make you look distinguished.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.714
10 bucks, man.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.783
This bag right here's
total, $75.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.519
Caddy time!

05:51.619 --> 05:53.120
This some fancy stuff.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.623
They even got shoes on.
Look at that.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.426
I bet I could probably get
$200 for this whole thing.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.363
*

06:03.464 --> 06:04.865
Let us pray.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.134
There better be some cash
in one of these bibles.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.470
"Holy Bible," "Everyday Bible."

06:09.570 --> 06:11.572
All the drawers are here.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.306
This would be
a nice little desk.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.175
This real. Listen...

06:15.275 --> 06:17.210
Who is it? Money!

06:17.310 --> 06:18.679
I like this.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.181
Kumbaya, Amen.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.151
I need to get this here
checked out.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.086
That's like a portable pulpit.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.521
A poodle pulpit.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.656
Drum roll please...

06:33.126 --> 06:35.596
- The last chance for finance,
Last chance for finance,

06:35.696 --> 06:38.766
in one, two, three!

06:38.866 --> 06:39.933
Shucks.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.935
50 movies in here,
a dollar apiece.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.737
You're looking at $50.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.306
That does it for "Kenny Do It"
in his storage finds.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.008
Now I gotta go get
that wood checked out.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.778
"Wood checked out."
That was a good one.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.714
And the Lord said,
"Make a left."

06:55.348 --> 06:56.249
- All right, here we go.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.719
7 1/2 by 10.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.388
*

07:01.489 --> 07:02.990
- Ivy, this has
your name all over it,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.592
except you're in khakis today.
- I would agree.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.993
- You're in like church--

07:06.093 --> 07:07.561
, I'd get naked
in a minute and buy this room.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.129
- Naked.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.600
I only get naked for
really, really good lockers.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.967
That don't sound right.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.069
- Go ahead, Brand-mi.
- Go ahead, Brand-mi.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.170
*

07:17.270 --> 07:18.939
What the , man?

07:20.474 --> 07:21.742
Look at this old toolbox.
- I know, man...

07:21.842 --> 07:23.076
- Those are good.
- That's all tools down there.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.411
A grease gun...

07:24.512 --> 07:25.613
- Melting pot of
in here.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.780
- I know.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.582
- Oh, my calculations
was right.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.018
This unit here
is strictly for Ivy.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.086
- Oh, my God,
look how organized it is.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.688
We might wanna
rethink our strategy.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.189
This was amazing.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.791
- Do you know what's happening
right now, Edwina?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.392
I feel it in my fanny.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.896
- All right, nice garage unit.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.165
--
400, and now 500.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.167
--450, 450.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.937
- Let's bid it.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.773
Now 600--
now 700.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.908
- 1000!

07:55.008 --> 07:56.744
- 1000, now 1,100.
1,100

07:56.844 --> 07:58.512
- Whoo--whoo!

07:58.612 --> 07:59.947
- Yeah!
- 1,200 and 1,300.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.949
--
1,300, 1,400, 1,400...

08:02.049 --> 08:03.116
- 1,500, 1,450.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.586
.
Dude with the glasses.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.287
- Yeah.
- 1,500 now, 1,600, 1,700.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.557
--
1,600, now 1,700.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.224
- Damn!

08:11.324 --> 08:12.993
- 1,800.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.562
- 1,800, now 1,900.
1,800, now 1,900--

08:14.662 --> 08:16.129
--2,100.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.031
- Damn!
- 2,100, 2,200.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.299
- 2,100 and 2,200--

08:19.399 --> 08:20.901
2,300 and 2,400.
--

08:21.001 --> 08:22.570
2,400 and 2,500.
- 3,000!

08:22.670 --> 08:24.071
- 3,000--

08:24.171 --> 08:25.539
- If that don't do it, I'm out.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.374
3,100
Anybody else?

08:27.474 --> 08:28.842
3,100. 3,000 now.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.011
3,100--
3,100 and 3,100...

08:31.111 --> 08:32.946
- Tap out, tap out.
- Sold to ya.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.415
Ivy wins it for $3,000.
- Whoo!

08:35.515 --> 08:36.483
- Thanks, Ivy.
- Told you it was

08:36.584 --> 08:37.785
gonna be a good day.
Told you!

08:37.885 --> 08:39.987
The Vegas ladies
need to stick to small.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.222
Big is my territory.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.791
- All righty!

08:43.891 --> 08:45.425
Let's go on down here, guys.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.427
Last unit of the day!

08:47.527 --> 08:50.197
- Oh... that was a good cut.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.431
- 10 by 20.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.402
*

08:55.502 --> 08:57.137
- Well, they got
a Honda generator,

08:57.237 --> 08:59.139
four tires, and everything else
seems like household.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.775
I really liked it until I got
more than two feet back.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.711
- The clothes aren't vintage.
- No.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.245
And some bull shirts.
- And Oscar the Grouch can.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.714
- And Oscar the Grouch can.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.782
- And a TV with a VHS on it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.784
- It matches their outfit.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.319
- Oh...
- Look at--

09:12.419 --> 09:14.888
Generators are worth money,
but it's an old generator.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.890
- That is a pressure washer.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.559
Actually, that's a pretty
good pressure washer.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.128
And with that being said,

09:21.228 --> 09:22.796
we probably have to
go on this unit.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.397
- All righty, guys, here we go!

09:24.497 --> 09:25.799
Nice big unit.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.367
And what do you say there...
- $100 bill!

09:27.467 --> 09:29.136
- And a $100 now.
150

09:29.236 --> 09:30.771
150--200...

09:30.871 --> 09:32.740
- Nah, that's it.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.042
--250.
Now 250, 300...

09:36.810 --> 09:38.612
Now 400--
- Yep.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.882
--
450, 450...

09:41.982 --> 09:43.984
Now 450. Now 475--

09:44.084 --> 09:45.185
- It stresses me out
a little bit.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.954
Does it stress you out?
- 475...

09:47.054 --> 09:48.421
- Make a decision,
make a decision...

09:48.521 --> 09:51.424
- Yeah.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.896
Make it 525, 550, and 550--
you're gonna make it 550?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.430
- Yeah.
- Now 575.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.299
- Whoo! Break it down.
- 575.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.669
575. 575. Now 600.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.972
And 625.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.007
625, now 625. 625.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.076
Now 625?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.443
Sold it to ya.
Jarrod and Brandi got it.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.612
$600.
- This is a good locker.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.381
I just hope Jarrod knows

10:14.481 --> 10:16.316
he's gonna do
most of the work.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.919
- All righty, guys, thank you
so much for coming out today.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.253
Make sure you go
and pay, please,

10:20.353 --> 10:22.389
before you start
loading up your purchases,

10:22.489 --> 10:23.724
and we'll see you next time.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.358
I guess
we got too picky,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.494
and we ended up with nothing.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.596
We're about to get
some of Ivy's stuff.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.098
- Hey, Ivy...

10:31.198 --> 10:32.733
- You got the unit we wanted.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.668
- Basically took it from us.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.536
- Uh, you could
if you were dressed right.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.239
- Uh, we have...
- Um, we have outfit to change.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.074
*

10:41.174 --> 10:43.210
- Wow.
Y'all look like prisoners.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.478
If y'all had shackles,
I'd be scared.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.847
- Let's get to it.
- All right.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.548
- Now let me show you
how we do things here.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.384
There's a method
to Ivy's madness.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.053
Grab it and go.
- Oh.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.454
- No.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.289
I didn't hire them
for their conversation.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.624
I didn't even hire them.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.992
- You don't wanna open
and look inside?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.928
- No.
- We're here to help you, Ivy.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.529
- Look at this, like, vintage--
ooh, look at this.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.597
- Uh--
That a-way, that a-way.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.133
- This is actual work.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.835
I thought this was
gonna be fun.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.070
- Come on, ladies,
class is in session. Let's go.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.438
- Ivy's about to school us
real quick.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.940
See, Shana, look,
there's a

11:13.040 --> 11:15.342
- These are all-terrain tires.
50 bucks for that one,

11:15.442 --> 11:17.344
100 bucks for this one.
Take the rim.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.179
So, right here,
we're looking at 150 bucks.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.115
All right, this is to a truck.
I put that at 100 bucks.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.583
Grinders, sanders.
Look at that.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.719
So, this whole box of tools
and nick-nacks, 70 bucks.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.221
You guys might be giving me
the appraisal on this one.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.823
Ooh!

11:29.923 --> 11:31.491
- Vegas.
- Cards and dice.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.493
- 50 bucks easy for the box.
- All right, 50 bucks.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.162
Glad I brought you guys.
It's really helpful.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.164
Rule number one,
forget the case.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.565
We want what's in the case.
- No, no, no,

11:38.665 --> 11:39.767
you don't understand...
- You don't understand...

11:39.867 --> 11:41.634
both:
This is a vintage Samsonite!

11:41.735 --> 11:43.070
- I understand that.

11:44.972 --> 11:50.143
- Let's see.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.211
- Rule number one,
forget the case.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.479
We want what's in the case.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.581
Let's see.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.316
- Well...

11:56.416 --> 11:57.985
- It smells weird.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.953
Now, this is awesome.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.789
- Oh, my goodness.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.024
- Vintage glasses.
- Oh, look at Mrs. Stewart's.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.426
- Ooh, now that'll probably
get you--ooh, it's full.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.761
- Ooh, those are cute.
- But my question is--

12:07.861 --> 12:09.763
- I would say this box
right here is 150 bucks.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.998
- I agree.
- But my question is,

12:11.098 --> 12:12.165
do you need this?
- Well, we need this box.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.433
- No, I don't care
about the box.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.968
I care about what's in it.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.169
And you guys aren't working
hard enough to earn that.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.570
Let's work harder.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.106
- All right, wagon--
ooh, Quartz.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.407
- And look at these stones.
You think--

12:20.507 --> 12:22.976
- Ooh...

12:23.076 --> 12:24.344
Vienna sausages.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.746
I love those.
- Well...

12:26.847 --> 12:28.048
- Well, this whole thing
right here,

12:28.148 --> 12:29.349
that's another 1,000 bucks
right there.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.517
- Right, easily.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.919
This one here...
- Oh, wow!

12:32.019 --> 12:33.553
- Oh, my God, this is
like a High Roller set.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.389
$100.
- Right here, 175 bucks.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.058
This right here
is 40 bucks alone.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.527
- The pistons--wow--300 bucks.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.962
- Video games.
both: Yes!

12:42.062 --> 12:43.263
This is one of
the reasons I bought it.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.365
25 each, 250 bucks.

12:45.465 --> 12:46.366
- All right...
- This toolbox, alone...

12:46.466 --> 12:48.001
- Yes.
- 300 bucks.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.403
Little safety hatch.
Eh, 200 bucks worth of tools.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.504
Moving on down.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.540
This right here,
60 bucks altogether.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.875
Ooh, Hot Wheels.
- Hot Wheels.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.210
- The Hot Wheels.
- Ooh, it's in the packages.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.946
- $50 a pop.
That's probably 100 in there.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.247
We're looking at 200 bucks.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.649
Craftsman,
work under your car, 30 bucks.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.684
Y'all got your muscles?
It's heavy.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.119
- Ooh...

13:06.219 --> 13:08.321
- This right here has
gotta be worth at least...

13:08.421 --> 13:11.058
- 500, if you can find the key.
- I'd say 500 too.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.893
Now, this is
what I was gambling on.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.794
- Car parts.
- Ooh, got some rims.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.863
Here's Chevy.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.164
- These vintage books
right here,

13:17.264 --> 13:18.231
easily 50 bucks right here.
- Vintage like--

13:18.331 --> 13:19.432
- Yeah, 50 bucks.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.700
- So this right here
is a $200 drawer.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.202
both: Whoa!
Whoo!

13:22.302 --> 13:24.137
- An old Buggy.
- Another...

13:24.237 --> 13:26.539
- There is an easy,
easy 500 bucks.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.242
Refrigerator made only in
General Motors? 500 bucks.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.878
These are from the 1920s.

13:30.978 --> 13:31.979
They're at least
100 bucks each.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.346
50 bucks.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.747
- Wow.
- Oil changer.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.116
- Yeah, put that in your car...

13:36.216 --> 13:38.919
- Drain the oil right into it.
50 bucks easy.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.153
And we're all done.
Now you can celebrate.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.289
- Oh, my God! Yes!

13:42.389 --> 13:43.857
*

13:43.957 --> 13:45.025
- Yeah.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.293
*

13:46.393 --> 13:47.627
Watch out.

13:47.727 --> 13:48.929
- Ew, I touched you
with the pillow. Yuck!

13:49.029 --> 13:50.630
- That's the closest we've been
in a long time.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.365
You think this thing works?
- I do.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.833
I do think it works.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.405
Yes!
, something works!

13:58.505 --> 14:00.073
- Whoo!
.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.975
That's probably 300 bucks.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.643
- 25 bucks apiece.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.778
That's 100 bucks.
We're at 400 bucks.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.080
- Oh, my God, we almost
made our money back.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.481
- Almost.
Oh, look at that.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.749
- Pressure washer, nice.
- That thing's--

14:09.849 --> 14:11.318
- Ooh, it's a roller.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.719
- That's fancy.
- That thing's awesome.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.421
I might keep that.
Look at how compact it is.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.256
- Not keeping it.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.191
Might keep it?
- Mm-mm. Nope.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.797
--

14:24.898 --> 14:26.366
- We're even.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.700
Let's go home. 600 bucks.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.569
- The rest is pretty much
trash in here, so...

14:31.804 --> 14:32.973
- Here, are you gonna
grab this? Watch, step back...

14:33.073 --> 14:35.542
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait...
Hold on--

14:35.642 --> 14:38.011
- I can only wait so long.
- I asked you to wait...

14:38.111 --> 14:39.346
- I know, I asked you
to grab that.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.114
- 'Cause there's some
Beats headphones in here.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.450
- I'm gonna say 20 bucks
for the Beats.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.985
- I think that says
"chandelier."

14:45.085 --> 14:47.720
Here--hey,
don't let this drop, please.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.957
- Oh!
- There you go.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.191
*

14:51.291 --> 14:53.093
- It's fancy.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.196
- Yeah.
We're making money.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.730
.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.067
It says
"United States Marine Corps."

15:00.167 --> 15:01.534
- Yeah.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.036
Feel it. That's not a toy.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.904
Easily 100 bucks.
- Easy.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.473
- Kitchen glass...

15:06.573 --> 15:07.907
I'm gonna need you--

15:08.008 --> 15:09.376
I don't know...
- Mm-mm.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.113
Oh, my God.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.781
- I didn't need that.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.683
Oh, change!
- Baby blankets.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.218
- "Please don't touch."

15:18.318 --> 15:19.987
- Look at these!

15:20.087 --> 15:21.321
I've never seen that before.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.655
- They're Muppets toys.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.524
Oh, yeah, Janice...

15:24.624 --> 15:27.427
"What's up, you guys?"
She's the stoned Muppet.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.661
These are awesome, J.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.896
I bet these are worth
some money,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.731
especially since
they're still in the boxes,

15:31.831 --> 15:33.733
and they look in
pretty good condition.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.235
We should get these
checked out for sure.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.436
Let's go see the Muppets.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.005
I love the Muppets.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.340
- Finally something
I'm excited about.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.741
Score on that.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.543
- Nothing happened!
Why are there quad tires?

15:43.643 --> 15:45.178
You think there's
a quad back here?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.513
I don't know, there could be.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.814
out of here.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.149
- Nuh-uh, you get
the  out of here.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.483
quad right there.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.052
- No, there's not.
Are you serious?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.253
- Look it. You don't see
that's the  throttle

15:53.353 --> 15:54.921
and the handbrake right there?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.889
- I don't know why Jarrod's
such a potty mouth today,

15:56.990 --> 15:59.359
but if there's a quad in there,
I don't give a .

15:59.459 --> 16:00.527
No, it's not.
- Yeah.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.961
That's a whole quad
standing up.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.763
- Oh, my God, it is.
It's backwards.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.099
- Yeah. It's probably
1,500 bucks, just in parts.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.635
Let's get it out.
Ready? Three, two, one, up.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.270
There you go.
Over, over, over, over.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.106
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.142
Good job.
You're such a hard worker.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.077
It's solid.
It's probably worth 200 bucks.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.711
There's a lawnmower down here.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.213
That's probably
another 100 bucks.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.483
- The bicycle is actually
worth the most,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.252
just holding everything in
right here,

16:25.352 --> 16:28.688
because the brakes are broken,
the tires are flat.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.091
Everything else is like
Christmas, Halloween.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.559
There's a little bit
more value back there,

16:32.659 --> 16:34.294
maybe a couple hundred bucks
in miscellaneous stuff

16:34.394 --> 16:36.163
that I can see, but...

16:36.263 --> 16:37.530
Plus the Muppets.
- And plus whatever

16:37.630 --> 16:39.166
the Muppets are worth.
- Plus Jim Hem--Jim...

16:39.266 --> 16:40.967
- I can't speak right now.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.635
- It's okay, you're pretty.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.037
- Damn right I am.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.008
- Been a while since
I've been up in here.
*

16:49.109 --> 16:52.812
I hope Pastor Hosea
don't give me no problems.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.481
I'm at Calvary Baptist Church

16:54.581 --> 16:58.351
to have Dr. Hosea Collins
look at my box of bibles.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.019
Is he really a doctor?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.354
- This what you was
talking to me about?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.722
- Yes, sir.
- Normally, I wouldn't let you

17:02.822 --> 17:04.191
put nothing on
the communion table.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.225
Come on, let's take a look.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.559
- Yeah, this is sacred.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.794
I don't know if it's okay
for you to carry it.

17:07.894 --> 17:08.928
- I didn't know
what it was at first.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.332
- Oh, locked up
in the storage unit.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.733
- Brother, you did
more than lucked up.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.368
You got blessed up,
you understand me?

17:15.468 --> 17:16.636
- You know what I thought
it was at first?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.037
- Bread box,

17:18.138 --> 17:19.472
a big old bread box.
- See, that's the problem.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.907
That's why you shouldn't be
touching this.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.075
I hope your arms
don't fall out.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.443
Lord, bless him
in Jesus name.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.677
All right,
here's what's happening.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.346
Before the bible
was mass produced,

17:26.446 --> 17:27.714
they didn't have
very many of 'em...

17:27.814 --> 17:28.981
- Mm-hm.
- So they would preserve them

17:29.082 --> 17:30.283
in this bible box.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.153
This was literally
the pastor's toolbox.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.622
- I ain't never seen no screws
and nails like this, bro.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.590
- If this...
.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.058
- It's all good, brother.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.493
I'm still your brother.
- Okay.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.761
- Even though I ain't
saw you in a year,

17:41.861 --> 17:42.762
I'm still your brother.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.331
- Pray for me.
- I am.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.166
- So, how old do you think
this piece is?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.801
- Easily to say, early 1900s.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.603
See from here to here?
- Yeah.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.272
- You see the different
variations?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.673
- Yeah, it look like
it been through something.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.808
- Brother, it has.
You exactly right.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.210
It's went through so much,

17:57.310 --> 17:59.779
and yet it was preserved
to make such a fine piece.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.214
You've got you
something authentic.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.916
God has blessed you.
Value is always determined by

18:04.016 --> 18:05.452
what somebody is
willing to give.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.621
- Well...
- But, honestly,

18:08.721 --> 18:10.257
the authenticity of it,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.592
I would say for this...
- Mm-hm.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.693
- Minimum...

18:13.793 --> 18:15.262
*

18:15.362 --> 18:17.597
1,000.
- I'm good with that one.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.266
- For what you thought
was a lunchbox,

18:19.366 --> 18:21.201
I guess that's pretty good.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.137
- Thank you, Jesus.
I will never miss church again.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.672
- Why don't you show
your gratitude

18:25.772 --> 18:29.576
by coming back faithfully
into the House of God?

18:31.644 --> 18:35.282
*

18:35.382 --> 18:36.649
- Yeah.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.851
- We're at the Ruby Theater

18:38.951 --> 18:41.020
to meet with Robert Guthrie,
a puppeteer,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.822
who can tell us
how much Kermit

18:42.922 --> 18:44.457
we're gonna get
for these Muppets.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.926
- Hey, guys, uh,
you got my Szechuan chicken?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.895
- Uh, no,
we're here for Robert?

18:48.995 --> 18:50.997
- Oh, yeah, he's, uh--
he's right in there.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.064
- Thanks.
- Have a good time.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.566
He's expecting you.
- Thanks.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.268
- I don't know.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.003
- Seemed like nice folks.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.805
- Looks like you got
some visitors there, buddy.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.006
- What in the--

19:00.106 --> 19:01.441
- Hey, guys.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.809
- Brandi.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.444
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All right.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.112
This is what we got, Muppets.
- Let's take a look.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.315
These are killer.
- I thought so.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.550
- Looks like you've got
at least most of 'em.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.851
The band is...

19:11.951 --> 19:13.119
- The band.
- The Electric Mayhem here.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.387
So you've got Dr. Teeth...
- Dr. Teeth.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.455
- You've got Animal
with his drum set.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.556
- Yes, okay.
- Oh...

19:16.656 --> 19:17.990
- Yeah, so we got
Janice over here.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.526
Look at this Zoot.
This is cool.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.228
This is really cool.
- Then we have an extra Animal.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.529
- Well, you can never have
enough Animals.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.830
- Yeah. Do you think
it's more valuable

19:23.930 --> 19:24.997
having the whole thing,
selling it as a set?

19:25.097 --> 19:26.366
- I would--yeah.
You always want

19:26.466 --> 19:28.468
every member of a band
instead of just one.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.769
- It depends which band.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.671
Do you want every
member of Nickelback?

19:31.771 --> 19:33.172
- I don't want
any member of Nickelback.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.308
- See, that's what I'm saying.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.410
Over here,
this is the best one.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.678
- I was pretty excited
about that one.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.113
- This is Jim Henson.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.482
That's...
- Whoa.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.183
- That's a killer figure
right there.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.185
This is the guy
that started it all.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.087
He created all of this stuff.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.557
- So this is really
collectible stuff.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.024
- There is a pretty big
demand for these.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.893
- Yeah.

19:53.993 --> 19:57.163
- On a good day,
the entire collection...

19:57.264 --> 19:58.931
*

19:59.031 --> 20:00.700
1,200 bucks.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.034
This is a good haul
right here, guys.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.036
- That is amazing.
- Yep.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.838
I'm gonna pour some of
my Pinot Grigio out

20:05.938 --> 20:08.675
for Jim tonight.
RIP, homie.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.977
- Well, do you guys wanna
play around with some puppets?

20:11.077 --> 20:12.144
- Uh, yeah.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.546
*

20:13.646 --> 20:15.147
announcer: Jarrod
and Brandi's Muppet toys

20:15.248 --> 20:18.818
helped them gain
over 3,500 Kermits.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.955
Dressing for success
led Ivy Calvin to 2,300 bucks.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.491
- Told you!

20:24.591 --> 20:26.626
announcer: Kenny Crossley's
portable pulpit...

20:26.726 --> 20:27.927
- Poodle pulpit.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.195
announcer:
Showed him the light

20:29.296 --> 20:30.963
and an extra grand.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.966
While Shana and Edwina
just couldn't quite get it...

20:34.066 --> 20:35.702
In sync.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.236
- It's the perfect puppet
for you, Brandi,

20:37.337 --> 20:39.105
'cause it looks
mad and confused.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.008
*

20:42.108 --> 20:43.610
- Why are you so close
to my face?

20:43.710 --> 20:46.245
- Well, you're the one
in the middle of the frame.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.981
Do you come to this monitor
often, angry green guy?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.283
- Hm.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.951
Uh...

20:55.755 --> 20:58.591
- I am really,
really bad at this.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.159
- How much did you pay
to get in here?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.494
I didn't pay nothing.
How 'bout you?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.596
Eh, me either.
Still doesn't seem worth it.
