02:03.290 --> 02:05.750
Dad, what are you...
Why aren't you at work?

02:09.628 --> 02:13.007
I'm going.
I just, uh, wanted to catch you first.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.804
You okay?

02:18.513 --> 02:19.848
What happened to your shirt?

02:23.268 --> 02:26.646
It's cold as a witch's tit.
You're gonna catch your death.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.233
- Let me get you something.
- No, I'm... It's fine.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.735
Well, coffee at least. Warm yourself up.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.990
I mean, Jesus, look at you.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.118
How long's it been since you slept?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.914
Now, I know this is a tough time for you.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.544
But this damn hole in the backyard...

02:50.086 --> 02:51.462
You keep going like this,

02:51.546 --> 02:53.631
you're gonna hurt yourself
or somebody else.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.225
I love you, son.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.396
I'll do whatever you need.

03:13.025 --> 03:14.861
There is nothing that you can do.

03:25.788 --> 03:28.666
Doc Rhodes gave me these
when your mother passed.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.628
I looked a lot like you do right now.
I don't know if you remember.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.672
I was doing everything I could
to hold it together, and then at night...

03:41.929 --> 03:43.848
There's no shame in bad dreams.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.230
Now, take two of these.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.525
Get some sleep.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.288
Good boy.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.546
You're a damn hero
as far as I'm concerned.

06:52.369 --> 06:54.456
Hey, easy now, Frank.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.832
Don't overdo it.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.383
What do you think?
We give it a last shot?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.051
Sure.

07:09.136 --> 07:12.765
Okay, one more time.
Colonel Morty Bennett, Fort Bryon.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.975
I infiltrate here.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.645
Make my way to Bennett's quarters,
which are here. I do what I gotta do.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.605
Yes.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.815
Then I head toward the extract point,
which is there.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.776
And that is where you'll be waiting
in the van.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.195
- Around the corner.
- That's it. You got it?

07:26.278 --> 07:27.947
- That's it.
- Good boy.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.409
Agent Orange.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.288
He knows I'm alive.
He knows I'm coming for him.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.167
It was him who was watching
that feed up on that mountain that day.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.625
I know it.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.672
If Gunner was right,
then Colonel Bennett...

07:45.715 --> 07:47.842
Bennett knows Agent Orange's name.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.511
He knows.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.472
...one of three, one of...

08:05.109 --> 08:08.070
Oh, thank you... Whoa. Too weird.

08:10.197 --> 08:11.491
On duty, huh?

08:12.158 --> 08:15.369
So what does that make me?
Your confidential informant or something?

08:16.538 --> 08:18.748
- Or something.
- Hmm.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.416
What?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.210
Nothing. I was just thinking.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.630
Well, more remembering, really.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.343
You look tired.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.764
- Well, I've been busy.
- Glad to hear it.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.265
So, what have you got for me?

08:39.309 --> 08:40.309
Nothing.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.898
I reached out to everyone I know
who served with Frank.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.692
Put the word out I needed to talk.

08:46.442 --> 08:50.112
If he's alive, he knows
I'm looking for him and he'll reach out.

08:50.988 --> 08:54.283
But we're a small community,
and so far, nothing.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.745
I wish I had better news for you,
but according to my sources...

08:58.580 --> 08:59.914
Frank Castle is dead.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.667
He's alive.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.044
Okay.

09:06.838 --> 09:11.217
If he's alive, after everything he's done,
why not just go public with it?

09:12.802 --> 09:15.802
- I already told you more than I should.
- Because you thought I could help.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.184
You said that he was hurt.

09:21.352 --> 09:25.356
- How could you know something like that?
- We found evidence of a firefight.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.318
Someone walked away bleeding,
the only survivor.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.946
Well, that sounds like Frank,
I'll give you that.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.115
Who was he fighting?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.535
Well, that's what I don't know yet.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.163
They took away all the bodies,
left no trace.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.833
Without Castle, I've got nothing.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.588
If he's alive...
I promise you I will find him.

09:50.882 --> 09:55.302
And then... maybe I can stop being
whatever "something" is

09:55.386 --> 09:56.679
and go back to the other thing.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.348
I like the other thing.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.144
- You know, the naked thing.
- I know what thing you're talking about.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.146
Relax. Nobody's listening.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.679
- You told him about Castle, didn't you?
- Generally, you knock before you come in.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.097
No, because he was Castle's best friend

10:22.121 --> 10:24.206
and if anyone knows
how to find him, it's Billy.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.458
You just answered your own question,

10:26.542 --> 10:28.711
and the next one,
which I guess would be, "Why?"

10:28.795 --> 10:31.923
Nope. The next one is,
why didn't you tell me?

10:32.006 --> 10:34.508
Shit, why didn't you ask me
before running to some civilian?

10:34.591 --> 10:36.302
Okay, I should've told you.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.681
Look, I know it's a Hail Mary,
but we're running out of options.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.724
You're not only compromising
this investigation,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.100
you're compromising me.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.394
I put my head in a noose for you
over this.

10:45.477 --> 10:49.398
What? You're not gonna tell Hernandez
about Castle, but you'll tell Billy Russo?

10:49.481 --> 10:51.233
How do you know you can trust him?

10:51.859 --> 10:55.071
- Same as with you. Instinct.
- Hmm.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.824
See... that's not gonna work.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.494
The implied flattery there?
No, nice touch. Appreciate it, but no.

11:03.537 --> 11:07.750
Uh, just curious. In Russo's case,
did the instinct have anything to do

11:07.833 --> 11:11.504
with his scarily pretty face
and catwalk silhouette?

11:11.796 --> 11:14.506
- Think I'm that shallow?
- Oh, we're all that shallow.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.593
- It's why pretty people rule the world.
- What do you want me to say?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.887
I want you to say you won't do it again.
And mean it.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.056
Okay. It won't happen again. Are we good?

11:23.057 --> 11:25.059
- Guess we have to be.
- Good.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.499
Most important thing is that Bennett
has to be where you say he is.

11:31.523 --> 11:35.069
100%. I've accessed his credit cards,
bank statements, phone records.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.671
I know where he gets his dry cleaning.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.865
I know what he got his mother
for her birthday.

11:38.948 --> 11:43.911
Colonel Bennett entertains at home
every Saturday night, like clockwork.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.287
Trust me.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.582
He's gonna be tied up with company
when you arrive.

11:48.665 --> 11:51.377
The sooner we find him,
the sooner I get to put the guy down.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.589
- You mean Agent Orange.
- What's that?

11:55.672 --> 11:57.049
Well, you just said, "the guy."

11:57.133 --> 12:00.136
I wanna make sure you mean Agent Orange
and not Colonel Bennett.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.889
- Because that's not the plan.
- I know what the plan is, David.

12:03.555 --> 12:06.058
Because I'd hate for you to get confused.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.145
You know, you got Colonel Bennett
standing in front of you.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.899
You hate the guy, you have a gun,
your blood gets up.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.526
- You know how it goes.
- How exactly does it go, David?

12:15.609 --> 12:16.819
I'm wondering. How does it go?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.446
Is that how it, uh...
Is that how it goes for you? Hmm?

12:19.530 --> 12:21.615
When your blood goes up, you just...

12:22.324 --> 12:25.828
boom, boom, boom?
You got a room full of dead guys?

12:26.537 --> 12:29.123
- I've never killed anybody.
- No.

12:29.498 --> 12:33.252
Because you know, I was thinking,
maybe this time I wait in the van. Right?

12:33.335 --> 12:35.629
Send you in,
seeing as how you know the plan so well.

12:35.712 --> 12:37.631
- I got the bad arm and all.
- Frank...

12:38.966 --> 12:41.677
I'm under no illusion
that I can do what you can.

12:43.220 --> 12:49.185
I appreciate what you're doing.
I appreciate the choice that you made.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.520
Oh.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.565
Well...

12:55.149 --> 12:57.693
- whole thing's crazy.
- How do you mean?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.821
Sneaking into a US military base.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.367
The thing I keep thinking about is...
you know, what if...

13:06.076 --> 13:08.496
what if one of these guys
tries to stop me, right?

13:08.913 --> 13:11.999
Am I supposed to kill a US soldier
for doing his job?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.088
Let's just hope it doesn't come to that.

13:18.965 --> 13:19.965
Hmm.

14:35.833 --> 14:36.917
What's going on?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.836
One day after we identify
Gunner Henderson,

14:39.921 --> 14:43.340
he ends up dead on some mountain
in the backwoods of Kentucky.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.717
Is there a reason
we're not doing this in your office,

14:45.801 --> 14:48.562
- you know, with the comfy chairs?
- That's one hell of a coincidence.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.763
Yeah, it is.

14:49.846 --> 14:53.309
Then this guy, the gall of it,
he puts his hand on my ass and says,

14:53.392 --> 14:54.894
- "See, perfect fit."
- Jesus.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.730
- Like it was still the '70s.
- What an asshole. Am I right? Yeah.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.763
That a true story, the hand on the ass?
'Cause I'm intrigued to know what you did.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.654
- It is, actually. I broke his finger.
- Of course you did.

15:05.737 --> 15:07.217
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.365
Yeah, though it's tough

15:08.449 --> 15:10.910
because we're standing in a hallway
and you're whispering.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.621
Yeah, my point is...
Henderson's death is not a coincidence.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.374
He was only killed after we were onto him.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.459
Hey.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.463
Mm-hmm.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.926
I think there's a bug in my office.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.811
So what does a place like this go for?

15:37.894 --> 15:39.605
I have no idea.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.025
The agency owns a few
up and down the East Coast.

15:43.109 --> 15:47.071
Safe houses, custody, interrogation...
that kind of thing.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.073
I could see myself in a place like this...

15:49.156 --> 15:50.324
...one day.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.577
- You saw Madani?
- You know I did.

15:55.787 --> 15:58.207
- You still sleeping with her?
- Every chance I get.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.709
Have you seen her? Thank you.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.091
She has no leads.

16:08.925 --> 16:10.594
Henderson was her way in.

16:10.677 --> 16:12.822
With him out of the way,
we don't have to worry about her

16:12.846 --> 16:14.556
unless, of course, she gets to Castle.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.976
There's no way
she gets to Castle before we do.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.810
Trust me. I know him.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.854
Clearly not as well as you think.

16:20.937 --> 16:22.707
You should've killed him
when you had the chance.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.485
The country has too much to lose
for Frank Castle to expose me.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.113
And should it come to that,
you need to know

16:29.196 --> 16:30.739
you'll be right there with me.

16:31.282 --> 16:34.201
No more government contracts,
no more Anvil.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.828
No Mr. Billy Russo.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.206
No country house.

16:40.832 --> 16:43.294
So I should have just... what?

16:44.086 --> 16:47.256
Killed him on the pier
right in broad daylight,

16:47.339 --> 16:48.882
in front of a calzone truck?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.344
No. Someone else. A sniper.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.514
You know...

16:56.390 --> 16:57.766
I always...

16:58.600 --> 17:01.937
thought of you
as more of a hands-on kinda guy.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.358
Your face when you were working over
those Afghans...

17:07.943 --> 17:10.779
They would talk and talk, scared shitless.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.782
Terrified and you'd just...
keep on hitting them.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.953
And there would come this moment...

17:18.579 --> 17:21.623
always, sometimes sooner,
sometimes later...

17:23.375 --> 17:25.461
where they knew that they were gonna die.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.005
And you knew it, too.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.135
You'd see it.

17:33.927 --> 17:37.139
And I swear, you would get
about as hard as a man could get.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.852
Is that your thing, Rawlins?

17:43.645 --> 17:46.940
I mean, I'm not judging.
Every man's got a thing.

17:47.023 --> 17:50.819
- Stay on point, Lieutenant.
- Oh, I am right on point.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.906
I saw that same look on your face once.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.699
That fear.

17:57.201 --> 18:02.123
When Frank gave you that milky eye,
he was gonna keep right on going, too.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.458
And you knew it then.

18:05.584 --> 18:09.546
All of your grand ambitions
choked out of you in a shitty tent.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.215
And who was it...

18:12.841 --> 18:16.345
Remind me,
who was it who pulled him off you again?

18:16.428 --> 18:17.513
Oh, yeah.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.392
- I did.
- For which I'm eternally grateful.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.978
Is that what you want, Billy?
My gratitude?

18:25.979 --> 18:29.024
You were protecting your own meal ticket
was all. I made you.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.318
You know what I think?

18:32.778 --> 18:37.449
I think that maybe the only reason
that you ever wanted Frank dead...

18:38.159 --> 18:40.952
was so that you could pretend
that he never made you feel

18:41.036 --> 18:42.329
like a man about to die.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.543
So...

18:48.502 --> 18:53.048
are we gonna warn Morty Bennett
that Frank Castle might be coming for him?

18:54.133 --> 18:59.054
Morty has the instincts of a rat
and the courage of a rabbit.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.891
We tell him Castle is still living,
one of two things happen.

19:02.974 --> 19:06.853
- He runs or he talks.
- So why not just kill him, too?

19:06.937 --> 19:09.731
Not if we don't have to.
Too many questions.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.526
We want Morty alive
and where we can find him.

19:13.444 --> 19:16.405
When Castle finally turns up,
we're gonna save his life anyway,

19:16.488 --> 19:18.324
so what can he complain about?

19:27.624 --> 19:29.918
Your favorite.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.965
Sit down and eat, Morty.

19:40.554 --> 19:44.266
Man, oh, man, the week I have had.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.520
You have no idea what it's like
living on a base with a bunch of cretins.

19:48.895 --> 19:53.317
A thousand men all looking for me
to tell them what to do and when to do it.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.779
If I didn't tell them, they wouldn't know
whether to shit or fall back in it.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.460
Look at the mess you've made.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.285
You missed a spot.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.569
- I'm in.
- Copy that, loud and clear.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.823
Okay, got you on the drone.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.375
We are good. You are clear to proceed.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.167
Wait.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.887
Okay, go.

21:50.684 --> 21:51.810
Shut it.

21:51.893 --> 21:55.063
If I wanted to hear from you,
I'd take that gag out of your mouth.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.734
I don't want to hear another sound
out of you.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.653
Not a moan, not a grunt. Nothing.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.907
But if you can be good...

22:06.908 --> 22:09.786
- I might just have a little treat for you.
- Mmm.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.417
Perfect. Hold there.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.223
You have one sentry coming up
on your left.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.550
He's gone.
You're clear to Bennett's quarters.

22:36.062 --> 22:38.565
Mm-hmm.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.424
Well, shit, Morty.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.699
Looks like I got here just in time.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.494
He's here! He's here!

22:51.912 --> 22:54.873
- We're up. Let's go.
- Roger that.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.929
- Oh, dear Lord, God in Heaven.
- Not exactly.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.681
All right, we're in business.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.016
We're tied into his phone. Three minutes.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.061
Get your ass up.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.272
Castle. I...

23:21.442 --> 23:23.902
Damn it, stop hitting me!

23:23.985 --> 23:26.530
Please, just stop.

23:29.199 --> 23:32.869
Don't kill me!
Please don't kill me!

23:32.953 --> 23:35.330
They made me do those things!

23:35.413 --> 23:36.641
- Frank...
- Don't kill me.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.042
You got four hostiles headed your way.
They're moving fast.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.322
They're gonna be on you in 30 seconds.

23:52.055 --> 23:55.642
You make a sound,
I open your head up all over this floor.

25:06.462 --> 25:08.632
How you doing, Frank?
More than halfway there.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.587
Almost done, Frank. We're close.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.740
Ten more seconds, Frank.

26:18.118 --> 26:23.331
Five, four, three, two...

26:26.126 --> 26:27.252
Get out of there.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.466
Stay down.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.334
What a shitshow. Get your asses up!

27:08.418 --> 27:11.296
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Saving your life, Morty.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.798
So why don't you put your pants on...

27:14.215 --> 27:17.093
and then you're gonna say exactly
what I tell you to say,

27:17.177 --> 27:18.594
when I tell you to say it.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.225
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

27:26.602 --> 27:27.603
Okay, go.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.662
Spread out.
Establish a perimeter watch.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.124
Come with me. Let's go. Move!

27:48.624 --> 27:49.793
Come on!

27:51.712 --> 27:53.355
Squad two to the east gate.

27:53.379 --> 27:54.589
Roger that.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.935
You're clear to proceed.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.489
Hands up.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.409
Get on your knees.

28:26.662 --> 28:28.874
- Don't come any closer.
- Easy, kid.

28:29.415 --> 28:32.127
Don't move any closer.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.712
I know. I know you got your duty.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.258
- Kid, I'm not your enemy here.
- Stop!

28:40.385 --> 28:41.970
I don't wanna have to kill you.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.058
Now, look... I'm gonna go that way.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.270
You do what you gotta do.

28:57.443 --> 28:58.569
I said stop!

28:59.320 --> 29:01.948
- Get on your knees right now. Do it!
- Come on, kid.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.786
- Get on your knees.
- Easy, easy.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.288
- Get on your knees. Now!
- Easy! Easy!

29:26.597 --> 29:29.184
Drive.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.436
You okay?

29:31.519 --> 29:34.605
Yeah. Shit's a lot easier
when you can kill people.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.405
No steam in those punches
but you don't need me to tell you that!

29:43.490 --> 29:44.741
Ali leans on him.

29:45.366 --> 29:48.536
- Ali sits back on the ropes...
- Hey, son.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.664
Hey, Dad. How was work?

29:51.747 --> 29:54.793
Ah, same as always, which is fine by me.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.586
You get some sleep?

29:57.295 --> 29:58.421
Yeah. Some.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.964
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.384
You want some pizza?
It's cold, but it's good.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.472
Here you go.

30:10.934 --> 30:11.934
Good.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.480
You look better, much better.

30:16.064 --> 30:19.150
A little sleep, a little rest.
That's all you needed.

30:24.780 --> 30:27.658
- How old's this fight?
- '74.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.578
You weren't even a twinkle in my eye yet.

30:30.661 --> 30:34.040
I never get tired of seeing it, though.
Watchin' Ali take a beating,

30:34.124 --> 30:37.085
letting Foreman get tired out,
waiting to strike.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.340
I envy boxers.

30:43.216 --> 30:45.135
What, getting beat for a living?

30:45.801 --> 30:47.387
No, sir. No, thank you.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.849
You know who your enemy is.
He's right in front of you.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.811
You got one job... Kill the other guy.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.287
You know,
everybody counted Ali out.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.278
Nobody thought he could win.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.947
Ali knew he couldn't beat
the guy toe-to-toe,

31:06.030 --> 31:08.199
so he rope-a-doped that sucker. Look.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.452
He knew it was gonna hurt,
but he was willing to take it,

31:11.536 --> 31:12.912
prove the world wrong.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.127
See, thing is, son,
you're not at war anymore.

31:20.628 --> 31:23.089
Maybe real life is more complicated.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.633
But it's not a fight.

31:25.716 --> 31:27.677
You still gotta get up every day...

31:29.095 --> 31:31.556
try and live your life
like a regular person.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.352
Oh, see that? See that?

31:36.436 --> 31:38.372
Foreman, he wouldn't change up his game.
He got tired.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.398
And boom! Knocked the hell out.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.276
Ali took back his title.
Thirty-two years old.

31:43.359 --> 31:47.113
- That man didn't have any quit in him.
- Do you think that's what I'm doing?

31:50.533 --> 31:52.761
I don't know what you're doing.
I don't know what you need.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.537
And I'm worried about you.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.626
Foreman couldn't do it his way...

32:00.752 --> 32:02.545
...and he lost.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.590
Other guy, he changed up his game.
Found a way to win.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.801
You're smart. You're a good boy.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.388
You can do anything you set your mind to.
Accomplish anything.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.685
I've done things, Dad.
Things that you don't know about.

32:17.768 --> 32:20.730
You didn't do anything
you weren't told to do.

32:23.149 --> 32:28.113
You fought their war, you took your licks.
Now, you gotta fight for yourself.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.848
Should've killed that
piece of shit when I had the chance.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.915
And we would have learned
precisely nothing.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.334
What'd we learn, huh?

32:41.417 --> 32:43.211
We're being too smart.
That's what I think.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.589
- Hmm. And by "we," you mean me, right?
- Yeah. You're goddamn right.

32:48.674 --> 32:51.219
Frank, tonight was a success.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.971
Okay?

32:53.805 --> 32:54.973
You were right.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.642
Agent Orange knew we would
go after Bennett next,

32:57.725 --> 33:01.562
and they were waiting for us.
They set a trap, but we saw it coming.

33:02.272 --> 33:05.400
They think they out-thought us.
It's the other way around.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.484
You understand that?

33:06.567 --> 33:09.029
If he calls anyone or moves,
we're gonna know it.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.198
- Nothing, huh?
- No. Not yet.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.576
What's going on? You think Bennett knows
we're tracking his phone?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.286
If he did, he would have turned it off.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.291
- God damn it.
- You all right?

33:23.418 --> 33:24.544
Yeah.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.384
There was this, uh...

33:32.135 --> 33:35.555
There was this kid there
at the end of the night...

33:35.638 --> 33:37.390
...and...

33:38.183 --> 33:39.684
I had to hurt him.

33:42.728 --> 33:44.522
A kid like that, he makes a choice,

33:44.605 --> 33:47.692
you know, be loyal to this country,
to a flag, his unit.

33:49.319 --> 33:53.489
Then comes some...
some piece of shit like Bennett, you know.

33:54.324 --> 33:57.202
He abuses that loyalty, that...

33:57.952 --> 33:59.370
It just makes me sick.

34:00.538 --> 34:04.459
From now on...
I'm taking out every single one of them.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.174
- Uh-oh.
- What is it?

34:11.257 --> 34:13.342
Bennett's on the move.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.253
You knew, you sons of bitches!

35:30.336 --> 35:33.088
You knew he was coming for me
and you said nothing!

35:33.173 --> 35:34.573
Not true, Morty.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.635
As soon as we got the intelligence,
we acted on it and saved your life.

35:37.718 --> 35:41.097
He almost killed me!
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

35:41.180 --> 35:44.267
Yes, we understand, because
you're saying it very loud and often.

35:44.350 --> 35:47.103
Man, oh, man. Do you understand
how much dancing I have to do

35:47.186 --> 35:48.479
to clean this shit up?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.690
Whole damn base was up in arms.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.443
- What did you say?
- What he told me to say.

35:53.526 --> 35:56.206
His lips were moving but I assume
you were the one that was talking.

35:56.696 --> 36:00.366
Secret training exercise,
unit readiness and all that shit.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.411
I reamed out the whole damn battalion
for their shitty performance

36:03.494 --> 36:05.330
and letting the intruder get away.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.540
Although, thank Christ
they didn't catch him!

36:07.623 --> 36:08.666
I thought Castle was dead.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.377
- As did we all.
- Till you got your intelligence.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.588
- Exactly.
- Yeah?

36:13.671 --> 36:17.633
Then how come Russo and his team
were already on the base?

36:17.717 --> 36:19.927
Without my knowledge. Hmm?

36:20.761 --> 36:23.431
And why'd that bitch yell, "He's here"?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.727
You staked me out like a goat.

36:27.810 --> 36:30.230
Then you think I'm stupid enough
to fall for your shit.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.565
You know, without us,

36:32.648 --> 36:36.151
Frank Castle would have your balls
wired to a car battery by now.

36:37.237 --> 36:41.616
- You'd probably love that though, right?
- Kiss my ass, Lieutenant Russo.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.076
If I want your opinion,
I'll give it to you.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.787
Far as I'm concerned, rank still applies.

36:47.162 --> 36:48.289
What did you tell Castle?

36:49.832 --> 36:52.001
- Nothing.
- Did he take anything?

36:52.084 --> 36:55.087
Did he take anything?
He was trying to take me!

36:55.170 --> 36:58.549
He said he knew what we did
and wanted to know who you were.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.759
What did you tell him?

36:59.842 --> 37:01.570
You kidding?
I didn't tell him anything.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.263
But he tried to get me to say something.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.140
- Did you give him our names?
- No, okay?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.935
I told him to kiss my ass.
He didn't get shit from me.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.231
You think that
if I'd told him what he wanted,

37:13.314 --> 37:15.483
that I would be alive
when you came through the door?

37:15.566 --> 37:19.194
See, Billy? I told you
we didn't have to worry about Morty.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.491
Damn right, you don't have to worry
about Morty.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.372
But... what are we gonna do now?

37:31.165 --> 37:34.043
Time's come for you to retire.
Just like we always talked about.

37:34.126 --> 37:37.922
- You backed me into a corner, William.
- And now I'm getting you out of it.

37:38.589 --> 37:42.468
We're gonna set you up with
a new identity, new passport, the works.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.930
You're gonna take all that money
I made you and start a new life

37:46.013 --> 37:48.015
and we're never gonna
see each other again.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.769
- Castle is never gonna find you.
- Sounds good.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.688
Russo will handle all the details.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.941
As soon as you have your credentials,
he'll get you safely out of the country.

37:57.024 --> 37:59.985
Until then, we'll hide you
at a secure location.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.864
All right. Empty your pockets.

38:13.040 --> 38:16.586
I've been waiting
to get back to my family for so long,

38:16.669 --> 38:19.964
it's hard to imagine that
it actually might happen.

38:20.047 --> 38:23.092
They've been living day in and day out
with my death

38:23.175 --> 38:25.970
and then all of a sudden,
I just walk through the door one night?

38:26.053 --> 38:28.764
- We're gonna need some serious therapy.
- Won't be easy.

38:31.016 --> 38:32.226
No. You're supposed to say,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.437
"Don't worry about it, David.
It's gonna be great."

38:35.021 --> 38:36.272
You want me to lie to you, huh?

38:36.356 --> 38:39.191
- I want you to lie to me.
- Jesus Christ.

38:39.274 --> 38:42.570
Yeah, we did 15-month rotations
in Afghanistan.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.880
You leave, you got a pregnant wife.

38:43.904 --> 38:47.450
You come back, the kid, he's...
he's walking, you know.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.453
He sees you for the first time,
starts to scream.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.537
He's got no idea who you are.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.706
I think you'll live.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.249
I know, but this is different.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.334
How so?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.295
I've allowed them to believe...

39:01.088 --> 39:04.884
this horrible fiction, you know?

39:04.967 --> 39:06.007
And I've done it for them,

39:06.051 --> 39:09.597
but I don't know
that they're gonna see that necessarily.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.725
I think maybe I just missed too much.

39:12.808 --> 39:15.478
Come on.
You didn't miss shit and you know it.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.105
You've been watching the whole time
on those cameras of yours.

39:19.189 --> 39:20.358
You know about that?

39:26.406 --> 39:30.868
Look... David, you do what you want,
but if I were you,

39:30.951 --> 39:32.620
I would not let your wife find out.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.955
She's liable to cut your nuts off.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.042
I know you're worried, but just walk in...

39:38.543 --> 39:40.335
hug each one of them
and don't let them go.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.046
Not till they beg you to stop.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.131
That's what I would do.

39:48.218 --> 39:49.679
- Sorry.
- Come on.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.056
Don't be.

39:52.723 --> 39:53.933
Not your fault.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.979
- Do you regret not taking Billy's offer?
- Nah.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.359
It'll still be there
when we're done, right?

41:23.606 --> 41:27.943
- You late for something?
- No. I would've settled for late.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.571
I missed it completely.

41:31.656 --> 41:32.823
Sorry.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.117
Just a date.

41:36.076 --> 41:40.080
Not the first one I've missed and I'm sure
it won't be the last. Not a big deal.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.082
You trying to make me feel better?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.375
Yeah, I am.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.879
Though I suspect
you don't feel bad anyway.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.466
If you do this job right,
then no matter who she is...

41:51.551 --> 41:53.803
she'll always play second fiddle.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.888
And no one likes that.

41:58.933 --> 42:02.562
Well, maybe you're right,
but it doesn't hurt to keep trying, right?

42:03.437 --> 42:04.797
Call me an optimist.

42:06.732 --> 42:09.485
- I'm gonna do you a big favor.
- You are? Really?

42:09.569 --> 42:12.988
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna give you
some free, unsolicited advice.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.115
I'm all ears.

42:15.199 --> 42:18.368
This job is not compatible
with family or friends.

42:20.871 --> 42:23.207
It's a lonely row to hoe.

42:24.458 --> 42:27.127
Best suited to closed-off types.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.714
And you, my friend,
are not a closed-off type.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.554
You know who you remind me of?

42:37.763 --> 42:38.764
Who?

42:39.932 --> 42:40.933
Frank Castle.

42:43.018 --> 42:45.688
- You know, you two are very much alike.
- We're nothing alike.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.358
I'm about the law. He's about...

42:51.819 --> 42:54.029
Well, that's what
we're trying to figure out.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.577
What are we gonna do about this bug?

43:01.621 --> 43:06.416
I haven't the faintest goddamn clue.

43:09.294 --> 43:11.714
It's a CIA safe house, Frank.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.883
Bennett must have run to Orange.

43:15.676 --> 43:16.676
Be careful.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.138
Happy hunting.

43:34.862 --> 43:39.950
- What the hell kind of place is this?
- Relax. It's only temporary and it's safe.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.787
Nobody's gonna look for you here.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.628
You all better come up
with the goods fast,

43:50.711 --> 43:53.255
or I'm gonna die
from looking at this wallpaper.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.382
We all gotta die somehow, right?

43:55.966 --> 43:59.053
Yeah. Good thing self-importance
isn't fatal, huh, Russo?

44:01.430 --> 44:03.348
You never liked me much, huh, Morty?

44:04.850 --> 44:08.270
Nope. You special forces types
always pissed me off.

44:08.353 --> 44:12.482
Superior sons of bitches, swanning around
like your shit doesn't stink.

44:13.943 --> 44:14.944
What the hell's this?

44:21.701 --> 44:23.452
Ah, Jesus!

44:27.331 --> 44:28.374
What I said...

44:30.209 --> 44:32.369
- I... I didn't mean...
- It's not about what you said.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.629
Look, there's no need. I'm leaving anyway.

44:35.505 --> 44:37.382
Tomorrow, I'll be gone.

44:37.466 --> 44:38.467
Yeah.

45:14.669 --> 45:17.589
You know, since we're being honest...

45:20.217 --> 45:22.552
I never much cared for you either, Morty.

46:07.556 --> 46:08.556
Yeah.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.309
It's done.

46:19.818 --> 46:20.818
One batch...

46:28.202 --> 46:29.202
two batch.

46:33.248 --> 46:34.959
Penny and dime.

46:35.305 --> 46:41.501
