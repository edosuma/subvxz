When danger approaches

00:18.588 --> 00:21.751
Know that l am on my way

00:21.792 --> 00:25.888

00:36.039 --> 00:37.836

01:28.491 --> 01:29.981
Hi.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.207
No, no problem.
No, thank you.

01:47.244 --> 01:50.509
My life is so over.

01:52.849 --> 01:55.317
Ron, turn down
the drama and eat.

01:55.352 --> 01:56.580
Not hungry.

02:00.790 --> 02:02.758
What am l gonna do, K.P.?

02:02.792 --> 02:04.623
Well, let's see.

02:04.661 --> 02:06.253
The guidance counselor
told you...

02:06.296 --> 02:08.594
that you need
an extra-curricular activity.

02:08.632 --> 02:10.997
Because it'll look good on
my college applications.

02:11.033 --> 02:12.592
That's years away!

02:12.636 --> 02:14.627
There's plenty of teams
and clubs out there.

02:14.671 --> 02:16.696
You could join the Mathletes.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.709
Right! l can't get in
that kind of shape!

02:19.743 --> 02:23.008
-How about the debate team?
-l'm not gonna argue with you, Kim!

02:23.046 --> 02:24.741
Afterschool activities
are great...

02:24.781 --> 02:26.544
like cheer squad for me.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.949
Cheer squad!

02:28.985 --> 02:31.453
For me. Not you.

02:31.488 --> 02:34.389
That's it! l'm upbeat.
l can do that.

02:34.424 --> 02:36.551
-Do what?
-Cheerleader!

02:36.593 --> 02:39.460
Yeah! Go Mad Dogs!

02:43.767 --> 02:45.200
Hi!

02:49.339 --> 02:52.035
My life is so over!

02:52.075 --> 02:54.737
l think it's cute that
Ron wants to be a cheerleader.

02:54.778 --> 02:56.769
Mother, boy bands are cute.

02:56.813 --> 02:59.145
Brown bear backpacks are cute.

02:59.182 --> 03:02.015
Ron as a cheerleader--
not cute.

03:02.052 --> 03:04.111
He'll wear a different outfit,
won't he?

03:04.154 --> 03:05.781
Knowing Ron...

03:05.822 --> 03:08.017
Hi, hon.
Pizza for dinner.

03:08.058 --> 03:09.457
What do you want on yours?

03:09.492 --> 03:10.754
Toppings...

03:10.794 --> 03:13.319
You know l love bacon
on pretty much everything.

03:17.834 --> 03:21.167
OK. See you
in 30 minutes or less.

03:25.508 --> 03:26.941
Gotta go.

03:28.578 --> 03:31.138
-Hello?
-Hey, Possible. Bob Chen.

03:31.181 --> 03:34.412
Did you launch something
over there?

03:34.451 --> 03:37.352
On the Q.T., Bob,
prototype G-6 rocket.

03:37.387 --> 03:40.015
Went up like a dream.
Too bad it wasn't...

03:40.056 --> 03:42.081
supposed to launch
until next week.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.753
-Lean on a button again?
-Roger on that, Bob.

03:44.794 --> 03:46.921
See you at the class reunion
this weekend?

03:46.963 --> 03:48.294
Wouldn't miss it. Ouch!

03:48.331 --> 03:51.494
The military is scrambling
around my rocket.

03:51.534 --> 03:54.196
-Better hop off, Bob.
-See you at the reunion.

03:54.237 --> 03:56.228
Same old Possible.

04:04.381 --> 04:06.315
You cannot allow this, Kim.

04:06.349 --> 04:08.840
Bonnie, l'm as freaked out
about this as you are...

04:08.885 --> 04:11.877
but there is no rule
that says Ron can't try out.

04:11.921 --> 04:14.515
Check your calendar!
lt's not Befriend-A-Loser Week!

04:14.557 --> 04:16.524
Ron is not a loser.

04:16.559 --> 04:19.687
He's just... different.

04:19.728 --> 04:22.459
-Ladies, let's boogie!
-Oh, yeah!

04:24.834 --> 04:26.392
Ladies?

04:29.205 --> 04:32.504
- They take a long time to get dressed.
- Hey.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.203
Where's the squad?
l'm pumped!

04:34.244 --> 04:37.577
They, um... they take a long time
to get dressed.

04:37.614 --> 04:41.516
Are you totally sure
you want to be a cheerleader, Ron?

04:41.551 --> 04:44.179
l'm not gonna be
a cheerleader, K.P.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.744
You're not? Great!

04:45.789 --> 04:48.087
l mean, why not?

04:48.124 --> 04:50.524
Because l'm going
to be the mascot!

04:50.560 --> 04:53.085
Middleton Mad Dogs!
Fight!

04:53.129 --> 04:55.188
Where did you get that mask?

04:55.231 --> 04:58.325
l made it with
my Movie Makeup Magic kit.

04:58.368 --> 05:00.359
What's the sitch?

05:01.738 --> 05:04.764
l'm impressed...and disturbed.

05:04.808 --> 05:08.039
Does it not rock hard?
Check this out!

05:08.078 --> 05:11.138
Mad Dog foams at the mouth!

05:11.181 --> 05:12.739
-Kim!
-Ron!

05:12.782 --> 05:14.545
The crowd will eat it up!

05:14.584 --> 05:16.108
Taste it.
lt's banana cream.

05:16.152 --> 05:17.449
Yum.

05:17.487 --> 05:19.887
Banana! Hey!

05:19.923 --> 05:21.413
This idea is idiotic.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.619
The entire student body
will laugh at you.

05:23.660 --> 05:26.185
-But--
-Not with, at.

05:26.229 --> 05:28.629
Loudly and cruelly,
they will laugh.

05:28.665 --> 05:32.032
You don't deserve to be kissed
by a naked mole rat.

05:32.068 --> 05:34.502
-Ron...
-l know, Kim. l know.

05:34.537 --> 05:36.129
You believe in me
and you'll work on them.

05:36.172 --> 05:39.403
l kind of agree with Bonnie.

05:39.442 --> 05:42.104
Oh, l see.

05:51.521 --> 05:53.421
Dad, l have a problem.

05:53.456 --> 05:56.721
Frankly, your mother
has the good advice...

05:56.759 --> 05:58.420
vis-a-vis boy trouble.

05:58.461 --> 06:00.827
This isn't about a boy.
lt's about Ron.

06:00.864 --> 06:02.923
Oh. Gotcha.

06:02.966 --> 06:05.901
Everyone got down on Ron,
and l don't know...

06:05.935 --> 06:07.664
maybe l should have
stuck up for him.

06:07.704 --> 06:09.433
But you didn't...

06:09.472 --> 06:12.669
He was foaming at the mouth.
l'm only human.

06:12.709 --> 06:15.405
You know, Kimmy,
back when l was in college...

06:15.445 --> 06:19.381
l had a group of friends,
my posse, if you will.

06:21.017 --> 06:22.211
lt was the night...

06:22.252 --> 06:24.413
of the big science
department mixer.

06:24.454 --> 06:28.220
ln those days,
l wasn't exactly a ladies man.

06:28.258 --> 06:29.725
Where's Drew?

06:29.759 --> 06:31.317
He was supposed to be here
a half hour ago.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.454
l knew he wouldn't come
through with dates for us.

06:33.496 --> 06:35.361
What did you expect?

06:35.398 --> 06:37.525
He cannot even come through
with a date for himself.

06:37.567 --> 06:40.536
-This was folly.
-lt was a nice dream.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.299
The dream is real.

06:42.338 --> 06:44.033
Drew! You found girls!

06:44.073 --> 06:47.372
Found! Gentlemen,
tonight we make history.

06:48.878 --> 06:51.346
l give you the future!

06:51.381 --> 06:53.975
My name is Bebe.

06:55.885 --> 06:58.649
Bebe, would you like to dance?

06:58.688 --> 07:01.384
Affirmative. Bebe will dance.

07:07.096 --> 07:10.327
As gentle as
a summer shower, no?

07:10.366 --> 07:11.833
No!

07:15.572 --> 07:18.370
All right.
Go on, laugh away...

07:18.408 --> 07:22.037
but one day my genius
will be recognized!

07:22.078 --> 07:24.205
Bebe will be perfect...

07:24.247 --> 07:26.511
and l will be
the one laughing.

07:26.549 --> 07:29.814
l am Bebe.

07:29.852 --> 07:33.015
Drew dropped out
and we never saw him again.

07:33.056 --> 07:34.751
l don't think
he ever forgave us...

07:34.791 --> 07:39.125
and in some small way,
we never forgave ourselves.

07:39.162 --> 07:40.527
For a giggle fit?

07:40.563 --> 07:42.622
No, no, Kimmy.
We laughed for days.

07:42.665 --> 07:45.259
Long and loud,
with youthful abandon.

07:45.301 --> 07:47.098
That was bad.

07:47.136 --> 07:49.627
So you'll reconsider
Ronald's dream?

07:49.672 --> 07:50.934
l don't think so.

07:50.974 --> 07:53.943
His Mad Dog routine
is way stupid.

07:53.977 --> 07:56.104
That's one person's opinion.

07:56.145 --> 07:58.306
One entire cheerleading
squad's opinion.

07:58.348 --> 08:00.839
Maybe you and your squad
just don't get it.

08:00.883 --> 08:02.111
You don't get it!

08:02.151 --> 08:05.678
''l'm Kim Possible.
l can do anything.''

08:05.722 --> 08:07.656
Except believe in
my best friend!

08:11.461 --> 08:12.723
Go, Wade.

08:12.762 --> 08:14.491
-l've got a weird one.
-Me, too.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.464
Professor Ramesh from the
Mount Middleton Observatory...

08:16.499 --> 08:17.796
wants your help.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.894
That name sounds familiar.
l think my dad knows him.

08:20.937 --> 08:23.565
Ramesh's partner,
Professor Chen, is missing.

08:23.606 --> 08:25.130
OK, Wade. Set up a ride.

08:25.174 --> 08:26.801
l'll bring the Man
of a Thousand Faces.

08:26.843 --> 08:28.811
No, thanks. l'll fly solo.

08:28.845 --> 08:31.837
l won't be flying,
but l'll get there somehow.

08:34.517 --> 08:36.917
Nice going, Possible.

08:36.953 --> 08:38.580
And that's
the traffic update...

08:38.621 --> 08:40.589
from your
''Eye Over Middleton.''

08:40.623 --> 08:42.591
Thanks for the lift, Dallas.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.650
lt's the least
l could do after...

08:44.694 --> 08:47.424
you brought that interstate
police chase to a happy end.

08:47.463 --> 08:48.657
No big.

08:48.698 --> 08:50.529
The guy didn't even know
he needed a new brake light.

08:54.137 --> 08:56.264
Better check on the Mad Dog.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.968
Ron? Come in, Ron. Ron!

08:59.008 --> 09:02.671
Sorry! Can't hear you!

09:02.712 --> 09:05.010
Bad reception!

09:07.317 --> 09:09.945
Come off it, Ron.
l know you're doing that.

09:09.986 --> 09:14.446
What? l'm only hearing
every other word!

09:14.490 --> 09:18.187
Ron! Don't be a baby.

09:20.663 --> 09:23.154
Stay back!

09:23.199 --> 09:26.862
Professor Ramesh...

09:26.903 --> 09:29.531
we have come for you.

09:33.309 --> 09:35.402
Who are you?

09:38.147 --> 09:41.548
l am Bebe.

09:41.584 --> 09:44.644
ls there an echo in here?

09:44.687 --> 09:47.884
Analysis subject--Kim Possible.

09:47.924 --> 09:50.051
Threat--minimal.

09:50.093 --> 09:52.323
That hurts.

09:59.535 --> 10:01.162
Not bad.

10:01.204 --> 10:03.900
Bebe is perfect.

10:26.696 --> 10:28.459
What are they?

10:30.867 --> 10:33.563
Kim, don't think l didn't...

10:33.603 --> 10:36.572
hear that baby comment.

10:36.606 --> 10:38.233
l heard it.

10:44.781 --> 10:46.271
Ron?

10:55.258 --> 10:56.589
Thanks a lot.

10:56.626 --> 10:58.753
What did l do?

10:58.795 --> 11:00.626
Those robots
took Professor Ramesh.

11:00.663 --> 11:02.028
Are you happy now?

11:02.064 --> 11:04.897
Yes.

11:04.934 --> 11:07.926
l mean, no!

11:07.970 --> 11:10.530
Whatever. All l know
is that now we've got...

11:10.573 --> 11:14.304
two missing scientists
and three killer Bebes.

11:16.446 --> 11:18.710
Huh?

11:18.748 --> 11:20.648
Professor Ramesh.

11:20.683 --> 11:23.914
Back in the old college days.
Check it out.

11:30.059 --> 11:32.857
Oh, yeah.
That guy must be Professor Chen.

11:34.597 --> 11:37.498
What? No way, that is not--

11:39.001 --> 11:41.128
Wow, it is! lt's Kim's dad!

11:41.170 --> 11:43.195
This is terrible.

11:43.239 --> 11:45.673
Can you believe he actually
wore his jacket that way...

11:45.708 --> 11:48.768
with the sleeves pushed up?
Totally Eighties.

11:57.119 --> 12:00.520
Kim's dad could be
the next target.

12:02.859 --> 12:04.417
Gotta tell Kim!

12:04.460 --> 12:07.190
No, wait.
We don't need Kim.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.326
l know exactly what to do!

12:27.116 --> 12:29.346
Subject--Dr. Possible.

12:29.385 --> 12:32.445
Directive--capture.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.225
Doctor...

12:39.262 --> 12:41.628
we have come for you.

12:55.578 --> 12:58.638
Kimberly Ann Possible!

13:00.416 --> 13:02.475
Dad? Here?

13:02.518 --> 13:06.648
Great. Kim found another
new recruit for the squad.

13:06.689 --> 13:10.750
Daddy, hi!
What are you doing here?

13:10.793 --> 13:12.590
-Where's Ronald?
-Not here.

13:14.263 --> 13:16.754
That hole in
the roof of my car...

13:16.799 --> 13:18.391
really grinds my beans.

13:18.434 --> 13:20.561
l'll be sure
that Ron gets the message--

13:20.603 --> 13:23.572
Wait a second.
He put a hole in your car roof?

13:23.606 --> 13:26.234
He came to the house,
said something about a mission.

13:26.275 --> 13:27.765
What mission?

13:30.780 --> 13:32.941
-Who is behind this?
-lt's obvious.

13:32.982 --> 13:35.974
Some villain needs our genius
to help take over the world.

13:36.018 --> 13:37.178
What else could it be?

13:37.219 --> 13:39.915
Gentlemen,
don't flatter yourselves.

13:39.956 --> 13:42.447
There is only one genius
in this room...

13:42.491 --> 13:45.585
and it is l, Dr. Drakken!

13:45.628 --> 13:46.822
Drew?

13:46.862 --> 13:49.057
Drew Lipsky?
ls that you?

13:49.098 --> 13:51.259
No!

13:51.300 --> 13:52.790
He's Dr. Drakken...

13:52.835 --> 13:55.804
and he's in
for a world of hurt!

13:55.838 --> 13:59.706
So, Kim Possible is near.

13:59.742 --> 14:01.710
Oh, yes!

14:01.744 --> 14:03.268
Actually, no.

14:10.786 --> 14:13.550
Wade, Ron's missing.
Can you find him?

14:13.589 --> 14:16.285
Do you think l have him
micro-chipped or something?

14:16.325 --> 14:17.758
Well, do you?

14:17.793 --> 14:21.251
Yeah. Hang on.

14:21.297 --> 14:23.925
And could you maybe
go a little faster?

14:23.966 --> 14:27.129
Kim, it's a school zone!

14:28.471 --> 14:32.771
l purposely programmed you
with a pinch of human emotion...

14:32.808 --> 14:35.936
just so you would be
ashamed of failures like this.

14:35.978 --> 14:37.741
lt's slipshod is what it is!

14:37.780 --> 14:40.078
-Slipshod?
-That's right, missy!

14:40.116 --> 14:42.141
And l demand better
from my lackeys!

14:42.184 --> 14:46.018
-Especially the robotic ones!
-Lackeys?

14:46.055 --> 14:50.116
Let's not get testy.
l am a patient man.

14:50.159 --> 14:55.153
You will get another chance.
Go forth and find Dr. Possible!

14:57.900 --> 15:00.869
Why are you after Kim's dad
and his friends anyway?

15:00.903 --> 15:04.339
Payback! For you see--

15:04.373 --> 15:09.367
Wait. Dr. Possible
and Kim Possible are related?

15:09.412 --> 15:12.506
-Duh.
-Don't ''duh'' me.

15:12.548 --> 15:14.379
Possible is
a very common last name.

15:14.417 --> 15:17.443
-So not.
-So--so, yes, it is.

15:17.486 --> 15:18.953
lt's pretty unique.

15:18.988 --> 15:23.357
Enough! l shall prove it!

15:23.392 --> 15:25.917
Where's the phone book?

15:36.238 --> 15:38.069
Park it close.
We shouldn't be long.

15:38.107 --> 15:41.201
Keep your keys, Dad.
He's been hit with knockout gas.

15:56.292 --> 15:57.520
This is bad.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.290
l'll say. They'd better
get this ironed out...

16:00.329 --> 16:03.025
before our big
college reunion this weekend.

16:11.474 --> 16:13.032
Kim, it was Drakken!

16:13.075 --> 16:14.599
Drakken's behind this?

16:14.643 --> 16:16.110
Fine, so in Middleton...

16:16.145 --> 16:18.272
there's only
one ''Possible'' family.

16:18.314 --> 16:19.941
D'oy!

16:19.982 --> 16:23.281
Kim Possible! And--and--

16:23.319 --> 16:25.617
Her father, Dr. Possible.

16:25.654 --> 16:29.590
There's no way
l can be expected to conclude...

16:29.625 --> 16:31.525
that my arch-nemesis
is the daughter...

16:31.560 --> 16:33.460
of a guy
l went to college with!

16:33.496 --> 16:35.726
Drew? Drew Lipsky?

16:35.765 --> 16:38.199
Wait!
He's the guy from college?

16:38.234 --> 16:39.667
My arch-foe?

16:39.702 --> 16:42.136
He didn't used to be blue,
l can tell you that much.

16:42.171 --> 16:45.732
But l was blue on the inside.

16:45.775 --> 16:48.972
Scorned by my so-called friends.

16:49.011 --> 16:52.003
My...my posse.

16:52.047 --> 16:55.847
But l vowed to prove
my genius to all of you...

16:55.885 --> 16:58.979
and when l got
the reunion invite--

16:59.021 --> 17:01.888
Since you dropped out,
you're not entitled to that.

17:01.924 --> 17:03.186
lndeed!

17:03.225 --> 17:07.423
Exactly why l planned
my own little reunion!

17:07.463 --> 17:10.022
Bebes, return to me at once!

17:12.867 --> 17:15.428
Who's the genius now?

17:15.471 --> 17:17.564
These robots are perfect!

17:17.606 --> 17:20.598
And their sole purpose
is to obey me!

17:20.643 --> 17:23.042
Question--
if we are perfect...

17:23.078 --> 17:26.638
why do we obey
one who is not perfect?

17:26.682 --> 17:30.482
Conclusion--
Drakken is unfit to command.

17:31.821 --> 17:34.153
lt's college all over again.

17:34.190 --> 17:35.680
That man cannot build a robot.

17:35.724 --> 17:37.453
He should take up cloning.

17:37.493 --> 17:41.452
Bebes, no! Bad Bebes! Bad!

17:41.497 --> 17:44.125
This is just too weird.

17:47.169 --> 17:50.195
Where did little Kimmy learn
to kick bottom like that?

17:50.239 --> 17:51.638
Cheerleading.

17:52.641 --> 17:53.972
Yes!

17:57.379 --> 17:58.573
Kim!

18:42.558 --> 18:44.788
We got a roomful
of geniuses here!

18:44.827 --> 18:47.022
Can't somebody
come up with something?

18:47.062 --> 18:49.360
-l'm an astronomer.
-Ditto.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.430
And you?

18:52.468 --> 18:56.564
Let the ladies work this out
amongst themselves.

18:58.841 --> 19:00.832
-Wade!
-Dr. Possible?

19:00.876 --> 19:04.209
l need a sonic disturbance.
Make it loud. Ultra-high frequency.

19:04.246 --> 19:05.975
Something to jam
a wireless network signal?

19:06.015 --> 19:07.312
Please and thank you.

19:17.293 --> 19:18.885
Analysis--subject--

19:18.928 --> 19:21.488
Dr. Possible's
attack strategy.

19:21.530 --> 19:24.431
Threat--substantial.

19:24.466 --> 19:27.663
Destroy electronic device.

19:39.915 --> 19:42.509
Dr. P! l'm open!

19:58.400 --> 20:00.334
Hive mind command...

20:00.369 --> 20:01.802
con-con-connection...

20:01.837 --> 20:03.361
lo-lo-lost.

20:03.405 --> 20:05.066
l'll take that as good news.

20:05.107 --> 20:08.508
Now, Kim, you know
l don't approve of violence...

20:08.544 --> 20:12.708
but they are deadly robots.
You go, girl!

20:40.509 --> 20:44.036
Way to go, Kim!
You, too, Dr. P.!

20:44.079 --> 20:45.512
What was that, Ronald?

20:46.815 --> 20:48.806
Way to go, Dad.

20:54.890 --> 20:58.792
What about
your college reunion, Drew?

20:58.827 --> 21:00.886
l'll come to the next one...

21:00.929 --> 21:04.387
when l'm even more successful!

21:09.938 --> 21:12.372
A little help.

21:12.408 --> 21:15.844
l can't believe Drew Lipsky
turned into a mad scientist.

21:15.878 --> 21:17.743
Let alone our daughter's
arch-nemesis.

21:17.780 --> 21:19.441
But my man knew what to do!

21:19.481 --> 21:21.381
Possible, you rock!

21:21.417 --> 21:24.511
Oh, please.
Drakken was so obvious.

21:24.553 --> 21:27.545
l mean, really.
The whole ''Bebebe'' thing.

21:27.589 --> 21:29.648
The hive mind behavior
was clearly the result...

21:29.691 --> 21:32.251
of a cybertronic linkage through
a wireless control network.

21:32.294 --> 21:34.228
Sure.

21:34.263 --> 21:37.198
Poor Drew. Maybe if we hadn't
laughed at him back then...

21:37.232 --> 21:40.998
there would be one less
mad scientist running around.

21:41.036 --> 21:43.163
The fact that
l was so rotten to you...

21:43.205 --> 21:44.638
that's not gonna
drive you to become...

21:44.673 --> 21:46.834
some kind of mask-wearing
villain, is it?

21:46.875 --> 21:48.035
lf l said yes...

21:48.077 --> 21:50.568
would you let me do
my Mad Dog routine?

21:50.612 --> 21:52.842
That's not a good reason
for me to say yes.

21:52.881 --> 21:54.041
l know.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.345
Because you're my best friend.

21:55.384 --> 21:57.079
That's a good reason.

21:57.119 --> 21:59.610
Boo-yah! Mad Dog lives!

22:15.804 --> 22:18.102
Please put
your hands together...

22:18.140 --> 22:22.008
for your
Middleton Mad Dog!

22:33.822 --> 22:35.483
They like him?

22:35.524 --> 22:38.493
Yeah.
Kinda surprises me, too.

22:49.271 --> 22:51.034
And...

23:02.151 --> 23:04.278
Bye-bye.

23:22.370 --> 23:24.804
Let's keep it moving, people!

23:26.975 --> 23:29.000
Stoppable, stow that gear.

23:29.043 --> 23:31.477
Aye-aye, Mr. Barkin!

23:31.512 --> 23:33.343
-My bad!
-Ron!

23:33.381 --> 23:35.440
Sorry, K.P.
l am just totally psyched!

23:35.483 --> 23:37.576
Tell me about it.
lt's been so long...

23:37.619 --> 23:40.179
since l've skied without
some crazed henchmen after me.

23:41.723 --> 23:44.214
Naked mole rat good to go.

23:44.259 --> 23:46.318
Look, Ron.

23:46.361 --> 23:49.296
Alan Platt.
He deserves our pity, K.P.

23:49.330 --> 23:50.558
So sad.

23:50.598 --> 23:52.190
The biggest trip
of the school year...

23:52.233 --> 23:54.064
And his parents
are the chaperones.

23:54.102 --> 23:57.594
-Humiliation Nation.
-Tragic.

23:57.639 --> 23:59.334
But better him than me.

23:59.374 --> 24:00.841
-Kimmy!
-Mom?

24:00.875 --> 24:03.070
What's the sitch?
Did l leave something at home?

24:03.111 --> 24:06.547
Not at all, honey.
Your friend Bonnie called us.

24:06.581 --> 24:10.312
The Platts came down with
the flu at the last minute.

24:10.351 --> 24:13.343
So we grabbed our gear,
dropped the boys at Nana's...

24:13.388 --> 24:14.878
and high-tailed it right over.

24:14.923 --> 24:16.220
Wait! You don't mean--

24:16.257 --> 24:20.751
Meet our new ski trip
chaperones! Smiles!

24:25.466 --> 24:28.230
You know,
it just occurred to me...

24:28.269 --> 24:30.703
some people might
find it humiliating...

24:30.738 --> 24:33.070
to have their parents along
on a class outing.

24:33.107 --> 24:35.871
Especially one
with a big photo spread...

24:35.910 --> 24:37.070
in the yearbook.

24:37.111 --> 24:39.579
You did this to me
on purpose, Bonnie!

24:39.614 --> 24:41.980
You are so paranoid.

24:42.016 --> 24:45.850
l think
your parents are...cute.

24:45.887 --> 24:49.550
-What you got there, Dr. P.?
-My homemade snowboard.

24:49.590 --> 24:52.423
-l'm ready for shreddy.
-Excuse me?

24:52.460 --> 24:56.556
Dad's trying to act cool?
l'm doomed.

25:00.735 --> 25:02.669
l know a fun travel game...

25:02.704 --> 25:04.399
that Kimmy used
to love on family trips.

25:04.439 --> 25:06.566
When she wasn't
begging for a rest stop.

25:08.409 --> 25:10.934
-lncredible!
-l know!

25:10.979 --> 25:12.674
Bonnie will pay for this.

25:12.714 --> 25:15.114
No, l mean this.
Check it out, K.P.

25:15.149 --> 25:17.208
We're heading straight
into the lair of the beast.

25:17.251 --> 25:20.243
''The Snowbeast of
Mount Middleton Makes Tracks''?

25:22.357 --> 25:24.757
Right. From the same
hard-hitting journalist...

25:24.792 --> 25:26.987
who broke the Frog Boy story.

25:27.028 --> 25:29.087
l was personally touched
by Frog Boy's struggle...

25:29.130 --> 25:31.428
to fit into a world
that can never truly accept him.

25:31.466 --> 25:34.264
Look at this picture.
lt could be anything.

25:34.302 --> 25:37.100
That's why the ''Wonder''
is offering $5,000...

25:37.138 --> 25:40.005
for a clear photo of the beast!

25:40.041 --> 25:43.807
You don't really believe
all that hooey, Stoppable?

25:43.845 --> 25:46.507
-Well...
-Thank you, Mr. Barkin.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.981
Some of us have
real issues to deal with.

25:49.017 --> 25:51.178
Like helping your parents
with the sing-along?

25:51.219 --> 25:53.551
-Here we go!
-Join in, Kimmy!

25:53.588 --> 25:57.581
Did you know that Kim has
a beautiful singing voice?

25:57.625 --> 25:59.752
99 bottles of pop on the wall

25:59.794 --> 26:01.659
99 bottles of pop

26:01.696 --> 26:03.288
You take one down,
pass it around

26:03.331 --> 26:05.822
98 bottles of pop on the wall

26:05.867 --> 26:07.698
98 bottles of pop on the wall

26:07.735 --> 26:09.669
98 bottles of pop

26:09.704 --> 26:11.695
You take one down,
pass it around

26:11.739 --> 26:13.798
97 bottles of pop on the wall

26:16.010 --> 26:19.241
Make sure you collect
all your personal belongings.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.680
Ready to find that snowbeast?

26:21.716 --> 26:23.707
Mr. B.? l don't get it.

26:23.751 --> 26:29.280
Stoppable, do you want
the whole class after the 5 Gs?

26:29.323 --> 26:32.224
l gotcha.

26:33.895 --> 26:35.453
What about Rufus?

26:35.496 --> 26:36.963
Tell you what, Stoppable...

26:36.998 --> 26:40.195
you help me get that photo
and l'll cut you in for 2% .

26:40.234 --> 26:41.929
How you diwy it
with your hairless pal...

26:41.969 --> 26:43.368
that's your business.

26:43.404 --> 26:45.031
Deal.

26:45.073 --> 26:46.768
Catch you later, K.P.!

26:46.808 --> 26:48.708
Ron, where are you going?

26:48.743 --> 26:52.042
That reminds me
of the cutest Kimmy story.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.479
We're on
our first family ski trip...

26:53.514 --> 26:55.709
Kimmy's two years old and
she takes off her clothes...

26:55.750 --> 26:57.012
in the middle of the lodge.

26:57.051 --> 27:00.646
Mom! Not now. Not ever!

27:00.688 --> 27:02.451
Honey, two year olds
have been known...

27:02.490 --> 27:05.323
to strut around stark naked.
Am l right?

27:05.359 --> 27:07.850
Absolutely.
Please...go on.

27:09.063 --> 27:13.124
Shouldn't we have mules
or sherpas or something?

27:13.167 --> 27:16.000
When l snow hike with Kim,
we get sherpas.

27:16.037 --> 27:18.267
You're not traveling
with the pep squad today, son.

27:18.306 --> 27:21.867
Up here,
you gotta earn your 2% .

27:21.909 --> 27:24.377
Wait a minute.
You hear something?

27:24.412 --> 27:25.572
Teeth chattering?
Knees knocking?

27:25.613 --> 27:27.376
Bladder sloshing?
That's me!

27:27.415 --> 27:28.780
Listen!

27:33.154 --> 27:34.485
Snowbeast!

27:35.923 --> 27:39.723
-Get a move on, Stoppable!
-lt's on! lt's on!

27:39.760 --> 27:41.022
Over there!

27:41.062 --> 27:44.930
Wait!
lt changed direction!

28:05.686 --> 28:07.745
Rufus! Rufus, you OK?

28:10.291 --> 28:12.282
Where's Mr. Barkin?

28:13.361 --> 28:15.226
lt got away.

28:17.632 --> 28:20.430
lt's coming back.

28:28.809 --> 28:30.868
Calm down, Stoppable.
lt's a woman.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.505
Thanks for noticing.

28:34.549 --> 28:37.245
Well, you know,
you're obviously...

28:37.285 --> 28:39.480
you know, female.

28:42.323 --> 28:44.518
We thought
you were the snowbeast.

28:44.559 --> 28:47.995
Not that you look beastly
in any way, ma'am.

28:48.029 --> 28:49.656
Oh, please.

28:49.697 --> 28:52.564
Don't tell me you believe
that silly fairy tale!

28:52.600 --> 28:55.831
-No, no.
-No, no, no.

28:55.870 --> 28:58.839
l'm Amy Hall.
Pleased to meet you, Mr...

28:58.873 --> 29:00.272
Barkin. Steve Barkin.

29:00.308 --> 29:03.800
-Say, Stevie...
-l prefer Steve.

29:03.844 --> 29:06.244
That makes two of us.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.044
Anyhoo, l got all
turned around up here.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.608
Would you mind
leading me back to the lodge?

29:11.652 --> 29:15.110
-Actually, we--
-Would be tickled pink.

29:15.156 --> 29:18.148
Pink is my favorite color!

29:18.192 --> 29:20.387
Excuse us.

29:20.428 --> 29:22.362
What about the photos?

29:22.396 --> 29:26.025
The photos can wait, Mr. B.
You got a lady on the line.

29:26.067 --> 29:28.627
-Come on, Stevie.
-Stoppable...

29:28.669 --> 29:32.127
Stevie!
The lodge awaits us!

29:32.173 --> 29:34.641
Mr. Barkin, babe magnet.

29:34.675 --> 29:37.371
Drop it, Stoppable.

29:37.411 --> 29:40.278
Ma'am, please follow me.

29:40.314 --> 29:43.147
To the ends of the earth,
Stevie.

30:01.068 --> 30:03.832
You built your own snowboard,
Dr. Possible?

30:03.871 --> 30:06.237
You'd be surprised what
you can cobble together...

30:06.274 --> 30:08.242
with odds and ends
from around the space center.

30:08.276 --> 30:09.868
l'd love to see it in action.

30:09.910 --> 30:12.174
-Slow down there, Dad.
-Kimmy?

30:12.213 --> 30:14.613
Yours is so much cooler
than everyone else's.

30:14.649 --> 30:17.243
You don't want to bum out
the other guys, do you?

30:17.285 --> 30:20.584
Gosh, Kimmy,
l don't want to bum anybody out.

30:20.621 --> 30:23.419
Good, Dad. Real good.

30:23.457 --> 30:26.984
ls everything OK, Kim?
You seem stressed.

30:27.028 --> 30:28.757
Kim!

30:31.098 --> 30:32.963
You did that on purpose!

30:33.000 --> 30:36.731
Now who's paranoid, Bonnie?
lt was an accident.

30:38.239 --> 30:41.504
-l owe you one.
-lt was nothing.

30:42.810 --> 30:44.641
Find your snow monster?

30:44.679 --> 30:46.909
How much do you know?

30:46.947 --> 30:51.975
l'm gonna buy y-o-u
a mug of hot cocoa, Stevie.

30:52.019 --> 30:53.680
That's really not necessary.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.313
l need to get back
to the slopes.

30:55.356 --> 30:57.483
With mini marshmallows!

30:57.525 --> 31:01.154
Hey! An Otterfly!

31:01.195 --> 31:04.528
That's right!
You collect Cuddle Buddies?

31:04.565 --> 31:08.797
l've seen them at the mall.
No big.

31:08.836 --> 31:11.896
Seen them? Kimmy went wild
for those little things.

31:11.939 --> 31:13.201
l'm the past president...

31:13.240 --> 31:16.175
of the Cuddle Buddy
Collectors Club.

31:16.210 --> 31:19.111
lt's so nice to find
a fellow Cuddler!

31:19.146 --> 31:22.172
You two must
have so much in common.

31:22.216 --> 31:26.516
You meet the nicest people
at Cuddle functions.

31:26.554 --> 31:28.249
l've never gone.

31:28.289 --> 31:30.416
Kimmy, who's your fave?

31:30.458 --> 31:33.427
Mine's Otterfly obviously.

31:33.461 --> 31:36.055
lt was a long time ago.

31:36.097 --> 31:38.031
What was that one
you never let me wash?

31:38.065 --> 31:41.762
-l don't--
-Pandaroo, that's it.

31:41.802 --> 31:43.736
You still sleep with
that little guy, don't you?

31:43.771 --> 31:46.831
So cute. Little Pandaroo.

31:50.177 --> 31:52.145
Kim?

31:52.179 --> 31:55.080
Bonnie knows about Pandaroo.
Hope is lost.

31:55.116 --> 31:57.482
That's harsh.
Can l borrow the communicator?

31:57.518 --> 31:59.383
Your concern touches me.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.820
Wade, what's
the snowbeast sitch?

32:01.856 --> 32:03.323
l've got no historical
sightings...

32:03.357 --> 32:05.484
no local legends, nothing.

32:05.526 --> 32:08.120
-You pulled Wade in on this?
-Only if he delivers.

32:08.162 --> 32:09.720
What were you talking about?

32:09.764 --> 32:12.597
Not about
the ''Weekly Wonder'' reward.

32:12.633 --> 32:14.658
Barkin has me down for 10% .

32:14.702 --> 32:16.226
-Ten?
-lf l deliver.

32:16.270 --> 32:18.636
Fine. Just call me
if you find anything.

32:18.672 --> 32:19.832
Keep it.

32:19.874 --> 32:22.069
Wade might want to share
some beasty breakthrough.

32:22.109 --> 32:25.010
-Want to come track it?
-Don't you get it?

32:25.045 --> 32:27.843
This weekend is now
strictly damage control.

32:27.882 --> 32:30.510
lf l don't stay on top of
my parents every minute...

32:30.551 --> 32:33.349
l'll never be able to show
my face in school again!

32:33.387 --> 32:36.083
l'm in Humiliation Nation!

32:38.459 --> 32:40.757
Let's move, Stoppable,
before that Amy woman...

32:40.795 --> 32:43.389
force-feeds me cocoa again.

32:52.206 --> 32:54.731
l think we're getting close.

33:02.082 --> 33:03.515
Something moved.

33:03.551 --> 33:05.883
lt didn't sound beast-sized.

33:09.957 --> 33:11.515
lt's just a dog.

33:11.559 --> 33:14.585
Hey, pup.
What are you doing way out here?

33:14.628 --> 33:15.993
Cheese and crackers!

33:16.030 --> 33:18.089
That's a mixed breed!

33:27.675 --> 33:29.506
Snowbeast.

33:30.711 --> 33:36.081
No! You naughty,
naughty beastie.

33:36.116 --> 33:37.344
You shouldn't have
run off like that.

33:37.384 --> 33:39.818
You had Mommy all worried.

33:41.522 --> 33:44.491
Amy, in the nick of time,
you tamed the beast!

33:44.525 --> 33:47.153
-You saved me!
-Why did it listen to her?

33:47.194 --> 33:49.458
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

33:49.497 --> 33:51.658
Why did she say ''Mommy''?

33:51.699 --> 33:55.157
You're a clever one, Stevie.

33:55.202 --> 33:56.430
Get the camera!

33:56.470 --> 33:58.062
Hey, that's mine!

33:58.105 --> 34:00.903
She wants the reward!

34:00.941 --> 34:02.203
Or not.

34:07.147 --> 34:09.672
Don't be a pig.

34:14.822 --> 34:16.722
Take them to the lab!

34:16.757 --> 34:19.054
Let me go! Let me go!

34:26.400 --> 34:29.927
Ron? Mr. Barkin?
l'll get Kim.

34:37.077 --> 34:40.672
Nice outfit, Dr. Possible.
lt's, like, retro chic.

34:40.714 --> 34:42.237
Groovy.

34:44.518 --> 34:46.918
l was making small talk.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.478
Forgive me
if that's out of bounds.

34:48.522 --> 34:50.853
-What do you mean?
-We'd better be going.

34:50.891 --> 34:54.054
We wouldn't want Kimmy
to be in Humiliation Nation.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.585
You heard me?

34:56.630 --> 34:59.030
Smooth move, Kim.

34:59.066 --> 35:00.897
Kim!

35:00.935 --> 35:03.096
-Wade?
-We've got a situation.

35:05.706 --> 35:09.437
You can't go gallivanting
all over the mountain.

35:09.476 --> 35:11.034
lmagine what people must think.

35:11.078 --> 35:12.238
What is this place?

35:12.279 --> 35:15.407
My homey little
genetics engineering lab.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.713
Let me show you
my favorite part.

35:22.222 --> 35:24.713
Sweet mother of pearl.

35:28.228 --> 35:30.662
Every Cuddle Buddy ever made!

35:30.698 --> 35:32.359
That's a lot of plush, lady.

35:32.399 --> 35:35.095
l collected them all,
but it wasn't enough.

35:35.135 --> 35:36.602
Cookies!

35:36.637 --> 35:39.333
-Question!
-Yes?

35:39.373 --> 35:42.274
What's up with the monsters?

35:42.309 --> 35:43.901
l wanted more.

35:43.944 --> 35:46.310
To go where no Cuddler
had gone before.

35:46.347 --> 35:48.815
Life-sized
living Cuddle Buddies!

35:48.849 --> 35:50.146
That's quite a leap.

35:50.184 --> 35:52.880
Not if you're one of the world's
foremost biogeneticists!

35:52.920 --> 35:54.581
They called me DNAmy.

35:54.622 --> 35:57.785
They said l was mad
at the Cuddle Con.

35:57.825 --> 35:59.224
Gingersnap?

35:59.259 --> 36:01.489
-Lady, you are--
-Special?

36:01.528 --> 36:05.123
You are sick...and wrong!

36:05.165 --> 36:07.725
You're just a meanie, Stevie!

36:07.768 --> 36:09.963
But l can fix that.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.233
Wade, try searching
the Cuddle Buddy website.

36:15.275 --> 36:18.767
They profile all major
Cuddlers--collectors.

36:18.812 --> 36:20.040
How'd you know that?

36:20.080 --> 36:23.641
l logged on a few times.
They're a good investment.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.279
Good call, Kim.

36:28.322 --> 36:30.756
-She's a biogeneticist?
-That's not all.

36:30.791 --> 36:32.281
She was kicked out
of her university...

36:32.326 --> 36:34.556
for unorthodox
splicing experiments.

36:34.595 --> 36:37.155
Her nickname was DNAmy.

36:37.197 --> 36:38.755
An out of control geneticist.

36:38.799 --> 36:41.927
l should've paid more attention
to Ron's crazed snowbeast talk.

36:41.969 --> 36:44.335
We need to hurry.
ls there a satellite...

36:44.371 --> 36:46.805
that can scan the mountain
for geological anomalies?

36:46.840 --> 36:49.832
Natch. Hoping to find
a hidden scientific lab?

36:49.877 --> 36:52.311
-lf it's not too much.
-You're on a roll.

36:52.346 --> 36:55.338
Artificial reinforcements
in a large cavern to the north.

36:55.382 --> 36:56.815
l'm there.

37:22.576 --> 37:24.339
Wait! Why punish Rufus?

37:24.378 --> 37:26.039
Barkin's the one you're mad at!

37:26.080 --> 37:30.176
That's it, Stoppable!
Kiss your 2% good-bye.

37:30.217 --> 37:34.916
We could have been
so cute together, Stevie!

37:34.955 --> 37:37.321
Now you'll find out
what it's like...

37:37.357 --> 37:40.588
to be genetically fused
with a hairless rodent!

37:43.197 --> 37:46.166
You are one twisted sister!

38:37.417 --> 38:41.080
Let them go, DNAmy,
or l'll--Pandaroo?

38:41.121 --> 38:44.284
Superstar edition?
They only made 12 of these!

39:02.743 --> 39:04.370
You like
Cuddle Buddies, Kimmy...

39:04.411 --> 39:07.676
wait till you see
my genetic zipper in action!

39:34.808 --> 39:37.333
-Rufus! You're a mutant!
-Gross.

39:37.377 --> 39:39.345
Naked mole man!

39:39.379 --> 39:42.439
My greatest
splicing success yet!

39:42.482 --> 39:44.040
Hey, Snowy!

39:44.084 --> 39:47.679
Looks like your mommy's
got a new favorite.

39:47.721 --> 39:49.018
She doesn't care about you.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.251
You're just another
collectible to her.

39:58.031 --> 40:01.296
Stop it!
Stop it this instant!

40:04.671 --> 40:07.834
There's room in my heart
for all of you!

40:26.226 --> 40:28.751
Thanks, K.P.
We gotta get Rufus back.

40:28.795 --> 40:30.763
-And Mr. Barkin.
-Him, too.

40:35.002 --> 40:39.462
No!
These materials are unstable!

40:39.506 --> 40:42.236
According to my readings,
the whole place is gonna blow!

40:44.077 --> 40:45.374
Mr. Barkin, no!

40:45.412 --> 40:47.642
Rufus, l know
you're in there, buddy.

40:47.681 --> 40:50.309
lt's me!

40:50.350 --> 40:51.908
That's my Rufus!

41:15.909 --> 41:18.503
Rufus, you're OK!

41:18.545 --> 41:20.342
And you're wearing
Barkin's clothes.

41:20.380 --> 41:22.473
Then what's Mr. Barkin wearing?

41:22.516 --> 41:26.043
Stoppable, l need pants!

41:29.022 --> 41:31.047
Let's evacuate, people!

41:32.559 --> 41:36.017
Just once, l wish the bad guy's
lair didn't blow up.

41:36.063 --> 41:38.725
-No!
-You have to leave!

41:38.765 --> 41:41.131
Not without my Cuddle Buddies!

41:57.117 --> 41:59.745
-We made it!
-Great.

41:59.786 --> 42:02.914
Now l've got to find
my parents to apologize.

42:04.324 --> 42:06.155
You might not get the chance.

42:06.193 --> 42:08.320
Avalanche!

42:13.033 --> 42:15.092
We'll never outrun it!

42:16.470 --> 42:17.937
No way!

42:17.971 --> 42:21.202
Get ready.
No time to stop!

42:21.241 --> 42:23.937
Hang on.
This could get gnarly.

42:36.390 --> 42:37.789
There they are!

42:37.824 --> 42:40.349
Awesome ride, Dr. P.!

42:52.906 --> 42:56.171
-Way to go!
-Cool!

42:56.209 --> 42:59.872
-That was amazing!
-l could never do that!

42:59.913 --> 43:01.778
Dad, you're amazing.

43:01.815 --> 43:03.806
Oh, no big.

43:09.322 --> 43:11.813
Come see me, Stevie!

43:17.864 --> 43:20.332
Mom, l am so sorry.

43:20.367 --> 43:21.595
Don't worry, honey.

43:21.635 --> 43:23.694
Your father and l
were teenagers once.

43:23.737 --> 43:26.433
Sometimes we forget
what it's like.

43:28.442 --> 43:31.172
lsn't this a sweet moment?

43:31.211 --> 43:33.907
-Bonnie!
-Mom?

43:33.947 --> 43:36.245
Pumpkin!

43:38.051 --> 43:39.780
Mother,
what are you doing here?

43:39.820 --> 43:43.119
l heard you kids
needed more chaperones...

43:43.156 --> 43:45.386
so l rushed right up.

43:45.425 --> 43:46.619
But you can't!

43:46.660 --> 43:50.221
Bon-Bon, don't go
flying off the handle.

43:50.263 --> 43:51.491
Bon-Bon?

43:51.531 --> 43:54.022
lf everything
isn't just so...

43:54.067 --> 43:56.695
little Bon-Bon
goes straight to pieces.

43:58.572 --> 44:01.439
But why? Who called you?

44:01.475 --> 44:03.500
There's too many kids
for just us to handle...

44:03.543 --> 44:05.340
and l figured
if Kimmy got to enjoy...

44:05.378 --> 44:10.281
having her parents around,
why not you, too, Bonnie?

44:10.317 --> 44:12.080
This is going to be such fun!

44:12.119 --> 44:15.520
You have to introduce me
to every single one...

44:15.555 --> 44:18.080
of your little classmates.

44:18.125 --> 44:19.786
You rock, Mom.

44:19.826 --> 44:22.522
You rock, too, Kimmy.

45:07.541 --> 45:09.406
Now, boys...

45:10.610 --> 45:12.237
You said we should practice.

45:12.279 --> 45:15.271
You also said we can't touch
the ball with our hands.

45:17.017 --> 45:18.279
Save it for the field, boys.

45:18.318 --> 45:20.616
-First time coaching?
-ls it that obvious?

45:20.654 --> 45:22.986
Your lack of protective gear
gave it away.

45:23.023 --> 45:24.820
Sorry!

45:28.662 --> 45:30.653
Would you go get them, please?

45:30.697 --> 45:32.597
Mom, they're your kids!

45:32.632 --> 45:35.430
But l hate this place.
You go.

45:35.468 --> 45:37.163
l'll give you $5.00.

45:37.204 --> 45:40.332
But the place reeks
of burnt pizza!

45:40.373 --> 45:44.332
Not the puppy dog pout!
That's mine!

45:44.377 --> 45:47.278
OK...

45:47.314 --> 45:50.340
but keep the engine running
for a quick getaway.

45:53.453 --> 45:55.114
Kim! K.P.!

45:56.223 --> 45:58.691
Ron?
What are you doing here?

45:58.725 --> 46:00.056
l come for the games...

46:00.093 --> 46:01.924
but l stay for
the burnt pizza smell.

46:05.899 --> 46:07.958
-l win!
-Rematch!

46:08.001 --> 46:09.935
Have you seen
my dad and the tweebs?

46:11.171 --> 46:13.162
Give me that ball right now!

46:13.206 --> 46:15.003
l'm not just saying this
as your father...

46:15.041 --> 46:17.509
but as your coach!

46:17.544 --> 46:19.068
Come here!

46:23.049 --> 46:24.880
Dad!

46:26.353 --> 46:29.811
Kimmy, the team needs a coach
until l'm back on my feet.

46:29.856 --> 46:31.380
You cannot be serious!

46:31.424 --> 46:33.619
l don't know
the first thing about soccer!

46:33.660 --> 46:35.787
What's to know?
You're wonderful with children.

46:42.068 --> 46:43.228
Those are not children!

46:43.270 --> 46:45.261
l'm not even
sure if they're human!

46:46.373 --> 46:48.102
Wade, what's the sitch?

46:48.141 --> 46:51.269
Trouble at J.P. Bearymore's
Pizza Party-torium.

46:51.311 --> 46:54.041
Tell me about it.
My dad's totally out of action.

46:54.080 --> 46:57.277
No, Kim! After you guys left,
they were robbed!

47:00.086 --> 47:02.714
Somebody stole J.P. Bearymore!

47:02.756 --> 47:05.281
At least you still
have the backup band.

47:05.325 --> 47:08.226
The bear was totally
carrying those hacks.

47:08.261 --> 47:11.822
J.P. is the state-of-the-art
in animatronic musicians.

47:14.701 --> 47:17.864
Whoever those thieves are,
they're not subtle.

47:22.275 --> 47:25.642
No, no. A villainous laugh
needs to be deep...

47:25.679 --> 47:28.307
from the diaphragm.
Try again.

47:28.348 --> 47:30.816
The laugh is not important.
l have the bear.

47:30.850 --> 47:32.078
Yes, but why stop at the bear?

47:32.118 --> 47:35.144
l have no use for the otter
and the beaver was off-key.

47:35.188 --> 47:38.589
Junior, a true arch-villain...

47:38.625 --> 47:41.150
doesn't leave behind
a perfectly good otter.

47:41.194 --> 47:42.684
l thought
this was my crime to run!

47:42.729 --> 47:46.165
Of course. Provided
you make sound decisions.

47:46.199 --> 47:48.463
Fine. l will get the otter.

47:48.501 --> 47:50.765
-And the beaver.
-Whatever.

47:52.205 --> 47:54.765
That bear is quite
a piece of work, Kim--

47:54.808 --> 47:56.537
state-of-the-art
inside and out.

47:56.576 --> 47:59.511
OK, so we need to think
about who might want it.

47:59.546 --> 48:01.776
-lndustrial rivals?
-Other animal bands?

48:02.982 --> 48:06.247
Pizzapotamus! No!

48:06.286 --> 48:09.778
-Ron!
-Not Pizzapotamus!

48:15.362 --> 48:19.321
lt's Senor Senior, Sr.
and Senor Senior, Jr.!

48:19.366 --> 48:21.800
Looks like we picked up
a few passengers--

48:21.835 --> 48:24.030
Kim Possible and
her sidekick-type friend...

48:24.070 --> 48:25.503
whose name escapes me.

48:25.538 --> 48:28.098
What is your name again,
young man?

48:28.141 --> 48:31.110
lt's Ron! Ron Stoppable!

48:31.144 --> 48:32.372
That's right.

48:32.412 --> 48:33.936
l will smash them
into a building.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.379
Junior, no!

48:35.415 --> 48:37.042
l do not like this at all.

48:37.083 --> 48:39.017
You cannot
simply smash your foe.

48:39.052 --> 48:41.043
-Why not?
-Give your foe a chance.

48:41.087 --> 48:42.247
To do what?

48:42.288 --> 48:44.654
To shimmy up the cable
and try something heroic.

48:44.691 --> 48:48.218
-Shimmy up the cable.
-You're closer. You shimmy.

48:48.261 --> 48:50.695
Have you seen me shimmy?
lt's not pretty.

48:57.537 --> 48:58.868
Hang on!

49:09.115 --> 49:10.946
Come on.
We don't have much time.

49:10.984 --> 49:14.078
They're in a helicopter.
We'll never catch them.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.348
Who's talking about them?

49:15.388 --> 49:17.117
Bueno Nacho
closes in three minutes!

49:17.157 --> 49:19.887
-l'm starving!
-Yeah!

49:30.136 --> 49:33.196
-K.P., this can't go on.
-What?

49:33.239 --> 49:37.198
Studying in study hall!
lt sets a bad precedent.

49:37.243 --> 49:38.870
Don't worry.
lt's not schoolwork.

49:38.912 --> 49:42.473
-The Senior and Junior case?
-Wrong again.

49:42.515 --> 49:44.710
Soccer.

49:44.751 --> 49:47.276
Or as the English
call it--football.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.787
You know a lot about soccer?

49:48.822 --> 49:50.915
Oh, yes.
l will teach you all l know.

49:50.957 --> 49:52.117
Let's see...

49:52.158 --> 49:54.126
soccer is the world's
most popular sport.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.923
You can't touch the ball
with your hands...

49:55.962 --> 49:58.590
-Unless you're the goalie.
-Really? That's it.

49:58.631 --> 50:01.225
The student has surpassed
the teacher. Nap-time.

50:06.139 --> 50:08.073
Keep 'em coming, Ron.

50:16.749 --> 50:19.411
-Are you the goalie?
-No, Kaitlin is.

50:19.452 --> 50:21.511
Then no hands.

50:21.554 --> 50:22.953
Cool! Let me try.

50:22.989 --> 50:25.014
Wait.
Your approach is all wrong.

50:25.058 --> 50:27.117
Like this.

50:27.160 --> 50:29.060
Take it, Tim!

50:29.095 --> 50:30.323
l got it, Kaitlin!

50:30.363 --> 50:31.887
Here's a give-and-go.

50:31.931 --> 50:33.558
See? You pass it
right back to the person...

50:33.600 --> 50:35.727
who passed it to you.

50:35.768 --> 50:38.498
l could've done that myself.

50:38.538 --> 50:40.529
There's no ''l'' in ''team.''

50:40.573 --> 50:42.541
And there's no fun in soccer.

50:42.575 --> 50:44.509
Not with her hogging the ball.

50:44.544 --> 50:46.705
Let me show you.
Do it like this.

50:52.552 --> 50:55.350
Junior, l do not approve
of the sign.

50:55.388 --> 50:57.185
Your lair should be secret.

50:57.223 --> 50:58.747
But l want people to find me.

50:58.791 --> 51:00.759
So it is a trap. Clever boy.

51:00.793 --> 51:02.420
Father, it is my scheme.

51:02.462 --> 51:03.986
Yes, of course.

51:04.030 --> 51:06.123
l just want to see
if it is evil enough.

51:06.165 --> 51:07.564
Please! l assure you...

51:07.600 --> 51:09.864
it will be the greatest
achievement of my life.

51:09.903 --> 51:11.461
Greatest evil achievement.

51:11.504 --> 51:13.699
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

51:20.113 --> 51:23.344
Keep it moving.
Use both sides of your feet.

51:23.383 --> 51:25.783
Here, l'll show you.

51:25.818 --> 51:29.413
-ls she scaring you, too?
-Oh, yeah.

51:29.455 --> 51:31.423
l am so glad
l'm just the equipment--

51:31.457 --> 51:33.391
Equipment manager!

51:35.662 --> 51:37.323
Blow these up! Hurry!

51:42.502 --> 51:45.130
l wasn't ready! Do-over!

51:45.171 --> 51:47.196
There are no do-overs
in a real game.

51:47.240 --> 51:50.573
Come on, hustle!

52:07.493 --> 52:09.188
Heads up! Survey the field!

52:09.228 --> 52:11.059
Keep the ball moving!

52:12.265 --> 52:13.596
What's the sitch, Wade?

52:13.633 --> 52:15.601
-How's the coach thing going?
-Getting there.

52:15.635 --> 52:17.694
Visualize goals!

52:17.737 --> 52:20.604
Visualize Senor Senior, Sr.

52:20.640 --> 52:22.437
What did you say?

52:22.475 --> 52:24.102
Triple-S has struck again.

52:24.143 --> 52:27.112
Listen up, team!
l've gotta jet.

52:27.146 --> 52:29.046
Yeah!

52:29.082 --> 52:33.348
That kind of attitude says
extra header practice.

52:33.386 --> 52:35.217
Now remember--hustle!

52:35.254 --> 52:38.189
l'll be back as soon as l can.

52:38.224 --> 52:40.385
That's not hustle.

52:43.496 --> 52:46.488
Our company has invented
a revolutionary new gas...

52:46.532 --> 52:50.059
that burns 100 times
brighter than neon.

52:50.103 --> 52:51.934
Doesn't look so bright to me.

52:55.008 --> 52:57.101
lt's quite bright, isn't it?

52:57.143 --> 52:59.475
Not as bright as
the stolen prototypes...

52:59.512 --> 53:01.639
but very bright all the same.

53:01.681 --> 53:03.979
What makes you think
Senor Senior stole it?

53:04.017 --> 53:05.484
They left this.

53:08.021 --> 53:09.215
Good day...

53:09.255 --> 53:11.450
unless you're watching this
after dark...

53:11.491 --> 53:13.152
in which case,
good evening.

53:13.192 --> 53:15.023
So Junior.

53:15.061 --> 53:17.188
You are no doubt wondering
why we have taken...

53:17.230 --> 53:18.492
your super-neon--

53:18.531 --> 53:19.930
What are you doing?

53:19.966 --> 53:21.194
A video calling card.

53:21.234 --> 53:23.259
lt will be
my villainous trademark.

53:24.837 --> 53:27.135
Have you studied
villainy at all, Junior?

53:27.173 --> 53:29.141
Father!

53:29.175 --> 53:31.803
-What do you make of it?
-Family issues.

53:31.844 --> 53:33.402
My eyes!

53:39.852 --> 53:42.946
-How's it going, Kimmy?
-Usual villain stuff.

53:42.989 --> 53:45.719
l meant the soccer practice.

53:45.758 --> 53:46.952
Uh-oh.

53:55.935 --> 53:58.768
OK, team.
That should be about enough.

54:01.507 --> 54:03.702
Same time tomorrow.

54:04.911 --> 54:06.708
My legs hurt.

54:06.746 --> 54:09.146
l can't even feel my legs.

54:09.182 --> 54:11.616
How are my star players?

54:11.651 --> 54:13.642
You two better
get a good night's sleep.

54:13.686 --> 54:15.620
Tomorrow we go full contact.

54:15.655 --> 54:18.522
lsn't soccer
pretty much no contact?

54:18.558 --> 54:20.651
That's what
the other teams think.

54:24.197 --> 54:26.165
You get one chimorito,
and they give you...

54:26.199 --> 54:28.724
a dozen little packets
of Diablo sauce!

54:28.768 --> 54:31.794
You can't possibly use
all this sauce.

54:31.838 --> 54:35.296
Somewhere there's a landfill
of unopened hot sauce...

54:35.341 --> 54:38.003
and someday l'm gonna find it.

54:38.044 --> 54:40.012
lf l put on a uniform...

54:40.046 --> 54:41.741
l could pass as
a tall ten-year-old.

54:41.781 --> 54:44.272
What do you think?

54:44.317 --> 54:45.477
l think it's just a game...

54:45.518 --> 54:47.418
and your natural
competitive Kimness...

54:47.453 --> 54:50.251
has taken you
to a very dark place.

54:50.289 --> 54:52.052
The team needs an edge.

54:52.091 --> 54:54.753
-You're the coach!
-l'm a hands-on coach.

54:54.794 --> 54:59.356
Hands-on soccer...interesting.

55:00.566 --> 55:04.866
Wade, do you think
it's wrong to help my team?

55:04.904 --> 55:07.395
-Like fund-raising?
-Like playing forward.

55:07.440 --> 55:09.340
Then l'd have to say yes.

55:09.375 --> 55:11.172
So...what's the sitch?

55:11.210 --> 55:14.202
Watch this. Junior calls it
his video calling card.

55:16.716 --> 55:20.777
Do you love the nightlife?
Love to boogie?

55:20.820 --> 55:22.754
Then come on over
to Club Lair...

55:22.789 --> 55:26.190
the globe's newest
and hottest disco.

55:26.225 --> 55:29.558
-He loves the camera.
-And the camera loves him.

55:29.595 --> 55:32.758
Club Lair is conveniently
located in Europe.

55:32.799 --> 55:34.994
Drive a little, party a lot.

55:36.469 --> 55:39.529
They shouldn't be hard to find.

55:39.572 --> 55:41.233
Yeah, the map helps.

55:46.779 --> 55:48.804
-What?
-l did not say a thing.

55:48.848 --> 55:50.748
You did. You said, ''Hmm.''

55:50.783 --> 55:52.842
l did not mean to say, ''Hmm.''

55:52.885 --> 55:55.683
lt is your evil disco, not mine.

55:55.721 --> 55:58.121
Good. Now, ready...

55:58.157 --> 56:01.251
steady...go!

56:09.702 --> 56:12.967
Yes, very nice.
But where is the villainy?

56:13.005 --> 56:17.499
Father, please!
l want to do this on my own.

56:22.148 --> 56:24.582
Thanks for the ride,
Mr. Blumberg.

56:24.617 --> 56:26.448
l owe you one, Kim.
l never would've...

56:26.485 --> 56:28.180
gotten around
the world in 80 days...

56:28.221 --> 56:30.018
if you hadn't saved me
from that hurricane.

56:30.056 --> 56:32.354
Anyone could've steered
a hot-air balloon...

56:32.391 --> 56:33.881
through gale-force winds.

56:33.926 --> 56:36.520
l'm just glad Ron was around
to serve as a ballast.

56:36.562 --> 56:39.759
This time l'm staying
inside the basket.

56:41.167 --> 56:42.532
l hope this doesn't
take too long.

56:42.568 --> 56:45.196
l promised the team
l'd do power drills today.

56:45.238 --> 56:47.536
Power drills?
That sounds harsh.

56:47.573 --> 56:49.165
No pain, no gain.

56:53.079 --> 56:55.104
Kim, the team wanted me
to talk to you...

56:55.147 --> 56:57.206
about your coaching technique.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.184
What about
my coaching technique?

56:59.218 --> 57:01.709
Too much technique,
not enough coach.

57:01.754 --> 57:03.312
What's that supposed to mean?

57:03.356 --> 57:04.823
They want to have fun, Kim.

57:04.857 --> 57:06.882
Winning is fun, Ron.

57:06.926 --> 57:09.121
See?
That's your Kimness talking.

57:09.161 --> 57:11.391
Well, l am Kim.

57:11.430 --> 57:12.829
lt's just a game...

57:12.865 --> 57:14.924
with small children...

57:14.967 --> 57:17.595
who cry when
they see you coming!

57:17.637 --> 57:20.367
Fine. We'll let the team
decide when we get back.

57:21.607 --> 57:23.336
Going down.

57:24.944 --> 57:27.344
So, you taught
the animals to cha-cha-cha.

57:27.380 --> 57:29.610
Now tell me
your villainous scheme.

57:29.649 --> 57:32.482
My plan is this--
as the funny animals...

57:32.518 --> 57:34.145
dance to
the pounding beat...

57:34.186 --> 57:36.780
the crowd will be inspired
to do the same.

57:36.822 --> 57:41.020
-And then?
-We will party all night long!

57:41.060 --> 57:44.518
Everyone will dance?
That is your evil plan?

57:44.563 --> 57:46.053
And...

57:46.098 --> 57:49.261
l will overcharge
for beverages.

57:49.302 --> 57:52.999
Sorry to break up the party,
Senor Seniors.

57:53.039 --> 57:55.234
What have they done
to Pizzapotamus?

57:56.776 --> 57:58.767
And where's
J.P. Bearymore's banjo?

57:58.811 --> 58:00.073
l'm so sorry...

58:00.112 --> 58:02.342
but tonight
is my grand opening.

58:02.381 --> 58:05.908
lt would be most inconvenient
to give up now.

58:05.952 --> 58:07.442
Did you see the thing
with the eyebrow?

58:07.486 --> 58:08.680
Nice touch, no?

58:08.721 --> 58:12.122
Other than wrapping
Pizzapotamus in polyester...

58:12.158 --> 58:13.750
this doesn't seem very evil.

58:13.793 --> 58:16.023
See? What did l tell you?

58:16.062 --> 58:17.529
l'm sorry, my friends...

58:17.563 --> 58:19.758
but this nightclub
is rather exclusive...

58:19.799 --> 58:21.790
and you're not
on the guest list.

58:21.834 --> 58:24.803
The clever threat.
Good, Junior.

58:24.837 --> 58:28.295
Follow through with
a display of violent anger.

58:28.341 --> 58:31.401
-l'm mildly put off at best.
-Throw something!

58:31.444 --> 58:34.470
l just had my nails buffed
for the gala opening.

58:36.315 --> 58:39.978
Junior, this is not a party.
This is not a disco.

58:40.019 --> 58:42.579
This is not fooling around.

58:47.994 --> 58:51.486
Sunglasses indoors?
How stylish!

59:03.309 --> 59:06.005
No longer will you interfere,
Kim Possible.

59:06.045 --> 59:08.343
Now you are under my control.

59:08.381 --> 59:10.406
What have you done, Father?

59:10.449 --> 59:12.440
The intense light
of the super-neon...

59:12.485 --> 59:15.010
is refracted into
a hypnotic pattern...

59:15.054 --> 59:16.783
by the modified disco ball.

59:16.822 --> 59:19.052
You modified my disco ball?

59:19.091 --> 59:23.323
But now they're standing still.
Everyone must dance!

59:29.035 --> 59:30.662
Gotta dance.

59:30.703 --> 59:33.103
Can't stop dancing.

59:33.139 --> 59:35.107
Must boogie. Oh, yeah!

59:35.141 --> 59:37.132
Did l not mention
that the hypnotic victim...

59:37.176 --> 59:39.474
responds to
the first suggestion given?

59:39.512 --> 59:41.036
They dance well
for hypnotized people.

59:41.080 --> 59:42.809
Junior, now is not the time!

59:42.848 --> 59:45.282
Europe's elite
will be here in a few hours.

59:45.317 --> 59:48.514
Yes...to get down
with their bad selves.

59:48.554 --> 59:51.182
No, to be hypnotized pawns...

59:51.223 --> 59:53.657
in our plan
to take over everything.

59:53.692 --> 59:55.057
But that is not my plan!

59:55.094 --> 59:56.584
lt is now.

01:00:04.603 --> 01:00:06.468
-Ready?
-Whatever.

01:00:06.505 --> 01:00:08.496
This is no longer my party.

01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:10.566
Junior, you can party
all you want...

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:12.668
when we control everything.

01:00:12.711 --> 01:00:14.178
l don't want to control.
l just want to--

01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:17.671
No! Do not speak
the ''D'' word.

01:00:17.716 --> 01:00:22.176
Ambassador, so pleased
you could make it.

01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:30.528
The crowd
is starting to perk up.

01:00:30.563 --> 01:00:33.088
Not for long.

01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:51.339
Hello. Europe.

01:00:51.383 --> 01:00:53.647
This is Senor Senior, Sr.

01:00:53.686 --> 01:00:58.521
l am in command of a disco
filled with fabulous VlPs.

01:00:58.557 --> 01:01:02.721
Can you speak up, sir?
The music is awfully loud.

01:01:02.761 --> 01:01:05.889
ln exchange for these
very important persons...

01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:10.493
l demand that you name me
King of Everything!

01:01:10.536 --> 01:01:13.903
l'll have someone get back
to you on this.

01:01:16.876 --> 01:01:19.276
Kim? Kim!

01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:25.641
Can't talk...dancing.

01:01:25.684 --> 01:01:27.083
Oh, my gosh!

01:01:31.824 --> 01:01:34.122
A hypnotic disco ball?

01:01:35.494 --> 01:01:36.893
Help!

01:01:36.929 --> 01:01:38.920
Help is on the way, Rufus.

01:01:48.974 --> 01:01:50.271
Aw, man!

01:01:52.878 --> 01:01:54.175
Now!

01:01:57.449 --> 01:01:59.110
You rock, Wade.

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:02.914
Let's get this blackmail
over with...

01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:05.014
so the party can start.

01:02:05.057 --> 01:02:06.354
Patience, my son.

01:02:06.392 --> 01:02:08.758
We are on the verge
of being royalty.

01:02:08.794 --> 01:02:11.160
Fine. Whatever.
Then we can all--

01:02:11.197 --> 01:02:12.528
Don't say it!

01:02:12.565 --> 01:02:15.659
Sorry, Seniors.
Cancel the coronation.

01:02:15.701 --> 01:02:18.397
Kim Possible.
You are so resourceful...

01:02:18.437 --> 01:02:20.769
unlike some people
l could mention.

01:02:20.806 --> 01:02:22.899
Always the put-downs!
But where is the praise?

01:02:22.942 --> 01:02:26.105
-Where, Father?
-Now is not the time, Junior.

01:02:26.145 --> 01:02:28.978
Senor Senior sounds like
a certain soccer coach l know.

01:02:29.014 --> 01:02:31.505
Does he have
too much Kimness now, too?

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:34.246
Not exactly.
He's just a control freak.

01:02:34.286 --> 01:02:38.347
You're...well...
Wow, that's weird.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.914
You know, Kim Possible...

01:02:39.959 --> 01:02:43.360
the disco ball is not
the only thing l modified.

01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:51.369
J.P. Bearymore's gone rogue!

01:02:51.403 --> 01:02:53.701
First they take his banjo,
now this?

01:02:59.245 --> 01:03:01.839
Attack, my robotic animal pawns.

01:03:08.554 --> 01:03:10.681
Not Pizzapotamus!

01:03:10.723 --> 01:03:13.123
Ron, we can't let
those innocent people get hurt.

01:03:13.158 --> 01:03:15.422
Not to mention
us innocent people!

01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:18.521
Can you hack into the system
controlling the animals?

01:03:18.564 --> 01:03:20.293
Kim, it's
the most sophisticated...

01:03:20.332 --> 01:03:22.027
computer system l've ever seen.

01:03:22.067 --> 01:03:23.796
lt's a banjo-playing bear.

01:03:23.836 --> 01:03:25.497
They took his banjo!

01:03:25.537 --> 01:03:27.528
l can't hack the bear.
Let me try the beaver.

01:03:29.475 --> 01:03:32.171
Father has made my party
a major drag.

01:03:32.211 --> 01:03:33.940
Everybody dance!

01:03:38.317 --> 01:03:40.945
Junior, what have you done?

01:03:43.889 --> 01:03:45.220
l'm in!

01:03:49.061 --> 01:03:51.427
Kim, l took out
the otter and the beaver.

01:03:51.463 --> 01:03:53.761
-Sweet, Wade!
-Kim!

01:03:59.071 --> 01:04:01.005
Help!

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.565
Bear! Bear! Bear!

01:04:26.598 --> 01:04:27.895
l'll be right down!

01:04:27.933 --> 01:04:30.231
No, Coach Possible...

01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:32.499
this is my ball!

01:04:47.786 --> 01:04:49.117
Goal!

01:04:51.423 --> 01:04:54.358
This is the last time
l let you run the show.

01:04:54.393 --> 01:04:55.621
lf you had let me run it...

01:04:55.661 --> 01:04:58.687
none of this
would've happened.

01:04:58.731 --> 01:05:01.063
Nice hustle.

01:05:09.842 --> 01:05:11.309
l hate it when they get away.

01:05:11.343 --> 01:05:13.038
Let's go.

01:05:13.078 --> 01:05:16.309
l've gotta do
some hands-off coaching.

01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:23.581
Good shot!

01:05:23.622 --> 01:05:25.988
Next time, try for
the other team's goal!

01:05:26.024 --> 01:05:28.049
You got it!

01:05:28.093 --> 01:05:30.789
The important thing
is that they're having fun.

01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:33.354
-l'm glad you see that now.
-Whatever.

01:05:33.399 --> 01:05:35.196
You'd better perk up.
You're the coach.

01:05:35.234 --> 01:05:36.633
Not anymore, Dr. P.

01:05:36.668 --> 01:05:38.533
While Kim was learning
to let go...

01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:40.538
the team let her go.

01:05:40.572 --> 01:05:43.370
-Who's coaching, then?
-The guy with the banjo.

01:05:43.409 --> 01:05:46.712
Way to go, team!
Kick that ball! Way to go!

01:06:13.639 --> 01:06:17.336
Who is that,
that freaky thing?

01:06:17.376 --> 01:06:21.506
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:06:21.547 --> 01:06:22.946
Come on, y'all...

01:06:22.981 --> 01:06:25.279
Nice guy.

01:06:25.317 --> 01:06:28.718
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:06:33.992 --> 01:06:35.755
Boo-yah!

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.191
Come on and listen
to the mole rat.

01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:49.033
Hit it!

01:06:49.074 --> 01:06:51.235
Yo, listen up,
have a holla from Ron

01:06:51.276 --> 01:06:53.437
''Naked Mole Rap''
is the name of the song

01:06:53.479 --> 01:06:55.174
Here's the story
in all its glory

01:06:55.214 --> 01:06:56.909
Ain't hidin' nothin',
y'all know what the truth is

01:06:56.949 --> 01:06:58.610
How Ron met Rufus

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.515
Never heard a cat bark,
never heard a puppy purr

01:07:00.552 --> 01:07:02.452
My dad's allergic
to every kind of fur

01:07:02.488 --> 01:07:04.456
So l searched for
hairless pets on the internet

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:07.391
Saw a jpeg of a pink thing,
gonna need sunscreen

01:07:07.426 --> 01:07:09.758
What is that,
that freaky thing?

01:07:09.795 --> 01:07:12.059
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:07:12.097 --> 01:07:14.122
Come on, y'all,
let the girlies sing

01:07:14.166 --> 01:07:17.101
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:07:17.135 --> 01:07:18.864
What is that,
that freaky thing?

01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:21.168
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:07:21.206 --> 01:07:23.299
Hey, wait,
l can't hear the girls sing

01:07:23.342 --> 01:07:25.572
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:07:25.611 --> 01:07:27.579
l heard Smarty-Mart
was havin' a sale

01:07:27.613 --> 01:07:29.945
On a hairless pink rodent
with a long skinny tail

01:07:29.982 --> 01:07:32.314
lt seemed to me
this could be a solution

01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:34.478
The perfect pet for my dad's
sensitive constitution

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.351
So the manager
came to open the cage

01:07:36.388 --> 01:07:38.151
He said, ''You know,
this pet's hairless''

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.420
l said l couldn't care less,
handed him to me and said

01:07:40.459 --> 01:07:42.518
''Be careful, don't drop it,
and do you want this cage?''

01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:44.324
''No, l'll keep him
in my pocket.''

01:07:44.363 --> 01:07:46.228
What is that,
that freaky thing?

01:07:46.265 --> 01:07:48.563
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.795
Come on, y'all,
let the girls sing

01:07:50.836 --> 01:07:52.963
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:07:53.005 --> 01:07:55.269
What is that,
that freaky thing?

01:07:55.307 --> 01:07:57.673
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:07:57.709 --> 01:07:59.836
l'm goin' to buy me
some bling-bling

01:07:59.878 --> 01:08:02.005
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:06.250
Psyche!

01:08:08.387 --> 01:08:10.878
Super-freaky! Psyche!

01:08:13.325 --> 01:08:15.725
Guitar, baby!

01:08:15.761 --> 01:08:18.024
What are we missin' here?

01:08:18.063 --> 01:08:20.395
Rufus, the naked mole rat

01:08:38.015 --> 01:08:40.506
Can l get a boo-yah?

01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:43.385
Can l get a boo-yah?

01:08:43.421 --> 01:08:45.720
Look at the camera,
say cheese

01:08:45.756 --> 01:08:47.747
Smile for the camera,
say cheese

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.453
Can l get a boo-yah?

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:52.486
Can l get a boo-yah?

01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:54.328
Look at the camera,
say cheese

01:08:54.366 --> 01:08:56.834
And smile for the camera,
say cheese

01:08:56.868 --> 01:08:59.098
We go to Bueno Nacho,
chimorito and a naco

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:01.604
Always grande size,
and why not, l'm buying

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.540
Rufus in my pocket,
you can't stop it

01:09:03.575 --> 01:09:06.066
Can't top it, don't drop it,
you might just pop it

01:09:06.111 --> 01:09:08.136
Rufus and Ron Stoppable

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.613
With our best friend
Kim Possible

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:12.617
We're not afraid of any attack

01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:15.643
l say, ''Yo, K.P.,
we got your back!''

01:09:15.687 --> 01:09:17.779
What is that,
that freaky thing?

01:09:17.823 --> 01:09:19.950
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:09:19.992 --> 01:09:22.221
Come on, y'all,
let the girlies sing

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:24.421
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:09:24.462 --> 01:09:26.727
What is that
super-freaky thing?

01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:29.165
Yes, that's right,
it's a naked mole rat

01:09:29.201 --> 01:09:31.192
Come on, y'all,
let those girlies sing

01:09:31.236 --> 01:09:32.828
Listen to the Naked Mole Rap

01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:35.897
-Yeah, this ain't no
-No freak-o

01:09:35.941 --> 01:09:38.205
Yeah, that's right,
it's the Naked Mole Rap

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:40.506
-This ain't no
-No disco
