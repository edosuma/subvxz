WEBVTT

00:10.975 --> 00:13.446
Whoa. This just in.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.149
(auto-tuned to dance music):
♪ My boobs are huge ♪

00:16.218 --> 00:20.123
♪ Squishy, squishy tits ♪

00:20.191 --> 00:21.927

00:24.432 --> 00:26.801
♪ You've got to feel
how soft my tits are. ♪.

00:26.869 --> 00:29.439
Well, it probably hasn't been
seen by that many people.

00:29.506 --> 00:31.709
1.4 million views!

00:31.777 --> 00:33.845
It's posted everywhere!

00:33.913 --> 00:35.581
As your lawyer,

00:35.649 --> 00:37.651
maybe I could send a cease.

00:37.718 --> 00:40.589
FazioMcBonerz99?

00:40.656 --> 00:42.291
Oh, God, it's humiliating.

00:44.963 --> 00:47.098
AMANDA:
Ryan?

00:47.166 --> 00:48.099
RYAN:
Oh. Uh...

00:48.167 --> 00:49.601
Amanda!

00:49.669 --> 00:50.803
Wh-What are you doing here?

00:50.871 --> 00:52.372
Sunday morning workout.

00:54.943 --> 00:56.243
Hi, I'm Amanda.

00:56.311 --> 00:57.745
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:57.813 --> 00:59.047
This is my neighbor, Jenna.

00:59.115 --> 01:00.615
She's Wilfred's owner.

01:00.683 --> 01:02.818
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

01:02.886 --> 01:04.086
Yeah, you too.

01:06.490 --> 01:09.859
Well, I gotta run, so...
see you later.

01:14.999 --> 01:17.568
Well, she seems...

01:17.636 --> 01:20.506
She is, she...
she totally is

01:20.573 --> 01:22.108
I mean, she wasn't just then.

01:22.176 --> 01:24.444
But she-she usually is.
Come on, treasure,

01:24.512 --> 01:25.746
I know you're under there
somewhere, you dick.

01:25.814 --> 01:26.914
(cell phone rings) It's Drew.

01:26.982 --> 01:29.285
Hey, sweetie...

01:29.352 --> 01:30.787
What?

01:30.854 --> 01:35.326
They just played "Squishy Tits"
on Howard Stern.

01:35.394 --> 01:38.163
Why are you telling me this
like you're excited?

01:38.230 --> 01:40.332
What are you doing?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.402
Sniffing up all the valuables

01:42.469 --> 01:44.304
these idiot beachgoers
leave behind.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.306
(metal detector whines)

01:46.374 --> 01:48.809
Oh, shit!

01:48.877 --> 01:51.045
You're not gonna believe this.

01:51.113 --> 01:53.015
I had my arm around
Jenna and of course,

01:53.082 --> 01:55.251
right at that moment,
Amanda shows up.

01:55.319 --> 01:57.654
So?

01:57.721 --> 01:59.823
So, that's not how
I wanted them to meet.

01:59.891 --> 02:02.093
The next step in
my relationship with Amanda

02:02.160 --> 02:03.728
is her hanging out
with my friends.

02:03.795 --> 02:05.630
I need to make sure
th get along.

02:05.698 --> 02:07.266
Ryan, have I ever

02:07.334 --> 02:09.835
told you the story
about Rex and Lady?

02:09.902 --> 02:11.370
Their owners moved in together

02:11.438 --> 02:13.006
and tried to force
them to be friends.

02:13.073 --> 02:17.311
But Rex was a free-spirited
swashbuckler, a dreamer,

02:17.378 --> 02:19.246
a Renaissance dog, really.

02:19.314 --> 02:21.816
Lady, on the other hand,
was a dyke.

02:21.884 --> 02:24.085
So one day,
their owners made them

02:24.153 --> 02:25.854
play in the yard together.

02:25.922 --> 02:28.157
Well, Rex ended up killing Lady

02:28.225 --> 02:31.194
and hiding her body
under the porch.

02:31.262 --> 02:32.908
And every now and then,

02:33.185 --> 02:34.986
Rex would go out and
look at the corpse

02:35.054 --> 02:37.456
and I would find myself...

02:37.524 --> 02:41.361
and Rex would find
himself getting aroused.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.234
My point is, you can't
control relationships.

02:46.301 --> 02:48.536
You have to let
things happen naturally.

02:48.604 --> 02:50.672
"Naturally" is what just
happened on the beach.

02:50.740 --> 02:51.840
(metal detector whines)

02:55.345 --> 02:57.079
Oh, my God, is that a...

02:57.147 --> 02:59.349
Piece of shit diamond broach.

03:04.055 --> 03:05.556
Anyway, I wish they'd met

03:05.624 --> 03:07.291
under better circumstances.

03:07.359 --> 03:08.526
Like a dinner party.

03:08.594 --> 03:10.528
Oh, I love dinner parties!

03:10.596 --> 03:12.831
They totally bring out
the Pomeranian in me.

03:12.899 --> 03:15.167
Wilfred, you're not exactly
dinner party guest material.

03:15.235 --> 03:17.771
I mean, the smell of food makes
you drool all over the place.

03:17.838 --> 03:19.106
And you lick people's scabs.

03:19.174 --> 03:20.341
Ryan, it's
a perfect opportunity

03:20.409 --> 03:22.009
for me to get to know Amanda.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.878
You've been dating her
for over two whole months

03:23.946 --> 03:26.614
and I haven't even so much as
sniffed her map of Tassie.

03:26.682 --> 03:28.716
Is that her...?
Yeah.

03:28.784 --> 03:30.886
(metal detector whines)

03:32.322 --> 03:34.056
Whoo-hoo!

03:34.124 --> 03:35.724
Sandy mayonnaise crusts!

03:38.962 --> 03:41.163
Mmm!

03:41.231 --> 03:42.865
So, that-that was funny,

03:42.932 --> 03:45.134
running into you
at the beach today.

03:45.202 --> 03:47.703
I'm really glad you
got to finally meet Jenna.

03:47.771 --> 03:49.872
Yeah, me too.
You guys seem close.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.442
I mean, you certainly
watch her dog a lot.

03:52.510 --> 03:54.177
(chuckles)

03:54.245 --> 03:57.013
You know, I have to ask you
a question about her.

03:57.327 --> 03:58.994
Totally.

03:59.062 --> 04:00.896
Anything.

04:00.964 --> 04:03.566
Is she... Squishy Tits?

04:03.633 --> 04:05.201
Oh, uh...

04:05.268 --> 04:06.702
Oh, my God, I knew it.

04:06.770 --> 04:08.437
What was her deal?
Was she on drugs?

04:08.505 --> 04:09.939
What? No!

04:10.007 --> 04:11.406
Uh... low blood sugar.

04:11.474 --> 04:14.309
Look, don't judge her
based on that video.

04:14.377 --> 04:16.678
I-I'm sure you'd really like her
if you got to know her.

04:16.745 --> 04:19.079
Maybe we can all
hang out some time.

04:19.148 --> 04:20.982
Like a dinner
party or something.

04:21.050 --> 04:23.551
You mean... at your place?

04:23.619 --> 04:25.019
I cook a pretty mean brisket.

04:26.455 --> 04:28.089
That sounds great.

04:28.157 --> 04:29.858
Hey, and maybe you could
even serve up some

04:29.925 --> 04:31.627
squ-squ-squ-squish,
a-squish-a-sh-squish...

04:31.694 --> 04:33.428
No. No, no.
...squish-squash, squish, squash.

04:33.496 --> 04:35.364
You seriously
cannot mention that.

04:41.638 --> 04:43.839
(mellow jazz plays)

04:48.811 --> 04:51.245
(knocking at door)

04:55.951 --> 04:57.085
Hey.
Hey!

04:57.153 --> 04:58.420
Welcome.

04:58.487 --> 04:59.587
Something smells great in here.

04:59.655 --> 05:01.022
Brought you some.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.625
Sheboygan Seasonal
Pumpkin Kale Ale.

05:03.693 --> 05:05.260
Oh. Great. I think
I still have the case

05:05.328 --> 05:07.263
that you gave me last year.

05:07.330 --> 05:08.531
You don't have to
hoard it, buddy.

05:08.598 --> 05:10.733
It's not our best seller.

05:10.801 --> 05:12.568
But, hey, more for us, u
right, bro?

05:12.636 --> 05:14.470
We're gonna put our coats
in your bedroom.

05:14.538 --> 05:15.772
Okay.

05:15.839 --> 05:18.040
(knocking at door)

05:21.378 --> 05:23.179
Hey.
Hi. I made a pie.

05:23.246 --> 05:25.280
Oh. You didn't have to do that.
I know...

05:25.348 --> 05:27.049
but I wanted to make
a good impression.

05:27.117 --> 05:29.184
Are they here yet?
What did you tell them about me?

05:29.252 --> 05:30.852
That I'm a nerdy chemist who spends
all day in a windowless lab?

05:30.920 --> 05:32.821
I did. But when they
see you in that dress,

05:32.889 --> 05:34.022
they're not gonna believe me.

05:36.926 --> 05:38.860
JENNA: Hey, Amanda. Hi.

05:38.928 --> 05:40.328
It's good to see you again.

05:40.396 --> 05:42.264
Yeah, you too.
This is Drew, my fiancée.

05:42.331 --> 05:44.966
She makes everything
sound so fancy.

05:45.034 --> 05:46.735
We're getting married.

05:46.803 --> 05:47.836
Congratulations. DREW: Thanks.

05:47.904 --> 05:49.338
That is a beautiful dress.

05:49.406 --> 05:50.340
Thank you.

05:50.368 --> 05:52.074
Ryan helped me pick it out.

05:52.141 --> 05:53.475
Aw.
Seriously?

05:53.543 --> 05:55.911
This is nice.

05:55.979 --> 05:57.312
I'll just put this
in the kitchen

05:57.380 --> 05:59.348
and get everyone some wine...

05:59.415 --> 06:02.785
or some Pumpkin Kale Ale.

06:02.852 --> 06:04.319
Oh, Jenna,
did I mention that Amanda

06:04.387 --> 06:05.954
went to school in Santa Barbara?

06:06.022 --> 06:08.524
Oh, no way! Drew and I are
getting married in Montecito.

06:08.592 --> 06:10.059
I love Montecito.

06:10.127 --> 06:11.994
Isn't it the best?
Oh, where in Montecito?

06:12.062 --> 06:13.696
(tapping on glass)

06:13.763 --> 06:15.063
Yoo-hoo.

06:17.634 --> 06:19.834
What are you doing here?

06:19.902 --> 06:21.269
I brought dessert!

06:21.337 --> 06:22.937
I found it in the most charming

06:23.005 --> 06:24.305
little French
bakery's Dumpster.

06:24.373 --> 06:25.873
There's nothing in here.

06:25.941 --> 06:27.708
Of course there is.

06:27.776 --> 06:29.309
There's a giant grease stain

06:29.377 --> 06:31.178
and a smidge of
crusty whipped cream.

06:31.246 --> 06:33.881
I've already chewed up four
of these boxes this week.

06:33.948 --> 06:36.049
After tonight, I swear
I'm going on a cleanse.

06:36.117 --> 06:37.951
Oh, sorry we're late, by the way.
We?

06:39.320 --> 06:41.054
Momentito.

06:41.121 --> 06:45.225
What are you doing sitting
over here, Cranky Pants?

06:45.292 --> 06:47.460
Can we just have a nice night
tonight? Please?

06:47.528 --> 06:50.831
Ooh, something smells divine.
No. Wilfred!

06:50.898 --> 06:52.399
I'll have a glass of Pinot.

06:52.466 --> 06:54.334
Just a club soda for Bear.

06:54.402 --> 06:56.136
Bear's back on the wagon.

06:56.204 --> 06:58.105
Five weeks sober.
It's a miracle.

06:58.173 --> 07:00.207
Take my coat?

07:00.275 --> 07:01.575
Wilfred, Wilfred,
I know what this is.

07:01.643 --> 07:02.910
You want to get to
know Amanda better,

07:02.977 --> 07:04.412
but now isn't the time.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.047
I need everything to
run smoothly tonight.

07:06.114 --> 07:07.315
And it will.

07:07.382 --> 07:08.916
(Jenna and Amanda talking)

07:08.984 --> 07:10.517
Oh, I should say hello.

07:10.585 --> 07:12.085
Wilfred, go home.

07:12.153 --> 07:13.520
Please.

07:13.588 --> 07:16.422
And miss out on
a delicious mingle?

07:16.490 --> 07:17.991
Oh, isn't that cute?

07:18.058 --> 07:19.859
Wilfy followed
us over to the party!

07:19.927 --> 07:21.327
Well, hello everyone!

07:21.395 --> 07:23.496
Amanda, so good
to see you again!

07:23.564 --> 07:24.964
No, no, no, no!
Down! Get him off...

07:25.032 --> 07:26.866
Get him off, get him off me!
Wilfred!

07:29.804 --> 07:32.105
Sorry. I...

07:32.173 --> 07:33.907
I'm not much of
a "dog person."

07:35.343 --> 07:39.546
I think I smell
something burning.

07:39.614 --> 07:41.348
I'm sorry.

07:41.415 --> 07:43.717
I can take him home
if it's gonna be a problem.

07:43.784 --> 07:45.285
No. No, I-I'll be fine.

07:45.353 --> 07:47.087
It's-it's...
I didn't want to

07:47.154 --> 07:48.955
make a big deal out of it.

07:49.023 --> 07:50.056
(sighs)

07:52.626 --> 07:54.961
You know, I just remembered...

07:55.029 --> 07:56.763
Jenna minored in art,

07:56.831 --> 07:59.032
and-and you... like art.

08:05.140 --> 08:07.408
Well, I was a business major,

08:07.476 --> 08:09.377
but this one time
my roommate and I,

08:09.445 --> 08:10.845
we had this big argument

08:10.913 --> 08:13.615
about whether it was
Monet or Manet.

08:13.683 --> 08:16.017
And it turns out
both are correct.

08:16.085 --> 08:18.086
(chuckles)

08:18.154 --> 08:20.055
That's the great thing
about art.

08:21.390 --> 08:22.691
I'll-I'll just, um...

08:22.758 --> 08:24.793
I'll go get your drinks.

08:24.860 --> 08:27.362
Wilfred, this is exactly why...

08:27.430 --> 08:29.330
Look, Ryan, I am sorry.

08:29.398 --> 08:31.766
I was just excited because

08:31.833 --> 08:33.667
I know she's a special
person in your life

08:33.735 --> 08:35.803
and I wanted to get
to know her better.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.337
But tonight's important to you,

08:38.405 --> 08:40.673
so I'm gonna be on my
best behavior from now on.

08:40.741 --> 08:43.076
Really?

08:43.144 --> 08:45.278
Some people like dogs,
some don't.

08:45.346 --> 08:47.080
It's a free country.

08:47.148 --> 08:50.417
You don't have to
worry about me, Ryan.

08:50.484 --> 08:53.419
Well, thank you for being
so mature about this.

08:53.487 --> 08:55.288
I mean, for a minute there
I thought you were gonna...

08:55.356 --> 08:57.223
Oh, shit!

08:57.291 --> 08:59.359
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

08:59.426 --> 09:01.194
What's going on?

09:01.261 --> 09:03.329
Isn't it obvious?

09:03.397 --> 09:04.864
All of the tension in the air

09:04.932 --> 09:06.232
has sent Bear
back to the bottle.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.568
Five weeks down the drain!

09:14.609 --> 09:17.878
Hey, look, Bear's
back on the wagon again.

09:17.946 --> 09:19.079
Problem solved.

09:20.615 --> 09:22.249
WILFRED:
Bear!

09:24.920 --> 09:26.520
Looks like we're in
for a bumpy night.

09:31.239 --> 09:32.940
Ryan, this brisket looks amazing.
Thanks.

09:34.008 --> 09:36.276
Okay, Bear, we're almost there.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.511
Whoopsie daisies.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.213
WILFRED:
Excuse us, everyone.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.914
Come on, let's get you
on your feet.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.583
No, Bear, we're not over here.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.087
No, you can't ride the go-carts

09:48.154 --> 09:49.455
because we're not at
the go-cart track.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.423
We're at Ryan's house, remember?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.091
Um, Ryan, do you think
I could get another plate?

09:53.159 --> 09:55.227
I think the dog may have
touched this as he walked by.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.130
Oh... uh...

09:58.197 --> 09:59.364
Here, take mine.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.703
My old dog used to love
licking my plate.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.838
She was such a sweetheart, too,

10:05.906 --> 10:08.374
and Wilfred loved her.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.710
Then one day,
she just ran away.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.880
I miss you, Lady.

10:13.948 --> 10:16.250
WILFRED: Yes, Bear, I
heard you the first time,

10:16.317 --> 10:19.220
"Six beers and Amanda's finally
starting to look boneable."

10:19.288 --> 10:20.721
Volume, Bear. Volume.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.793
You know, dogs are
very hygienic animals.

10:26.428 --> 10:28.630
So, Jenna...

10:28.697 --> 10:29.931
how's the wedding
planning going?

10:29.999 --> 10:31.967
Good.
I read somewhere that

10:32.034 --> 10:33.668
dog mouths are cleaner
than people mouths.

10:33.736 --> 10:35.537
That's actually
a common misconception.

10:35.604 --> 10:37.305
Dogs' mouths harbor

10:37.373 --> 10:39.508
a massive infectious
disease and viral load.

10:39.575 --> 10:43.311
In fact, one dog lick and you
could end up with, um...

10:43.379 --> 10:46.381
Hantavirus, E. Coli,
Hepatitis...

10:46.448 --> 10:48.116
WILFRED: Yes, I get it, Bear.
I'm your best friend.

10:48.184 --> 10:50.452
I'm one of the good ones.
You love me.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.754
Well, I'm a journalist, and...
Yeah, I've seen your work.

10:54.023 --> 10:55.724
Thanks.

10:55.792 --> 10:58.426
I've seen plenty of research
about dogs...

10:58.494 --> 11:00.629
Bear, your breath!
Give me a little space!

11:02.031 --> 11:03.932
Oh! Oh, God.
Are you okay?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.168
DREW: Okay, Wilfy, time to go.

11:06.235 --> 11:07.502
No, it's fine, it's fine.

11:07.570 --> 11:09.504
I'm sorry. I just, um...

11:09.572 --> 11:10.906
I'm gonna go clean up.

11:10.974 --> 11:11.974
(dish clatters)

11:12.042 --> 11:13.375
You're destroying
my dinner party!

11:13.443 --> 11:14.977
It's not me!
It's Bear!

11:15.045 --> 11:17.146
Let's just get through
the rest of the night,

11:17.213 --> 11:20.149
and in the morning we can try
to get Bear back to rehab.

11:20.217 --> 11:22.117
Enough! If you keep
acting like this,

11:22.185 --> 11:23.986
you're gonna cost me
my first real relationship

11:24.054 --> 11:25.254
in almost two years.

11:28.057 --> 11:30.292
Wait. Since when does
Bear have two eyes?

11:30.359 --> 11:33.628
Bear stole that button
off Amanda's coat.

11:33.696 --> 11:35.363
When Bear drinks,

11:35.431 --> 11:37.098
all impulse control goes
out the window.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.766
You ruined her coat?

11:38.834 --> 11:40.168
Well, in all fairness,

11:40.235 --> 11:41.636
is keeping her little
coat buttoned up

11:41.704 --> 11:42.837
more important than
giving someone

11:42.905 --> 11:45.573
the precious gift of sight?

11:45.641 --> 11:48.477
Oh, God! You monster!

11:48.544 --> 11:50.712
It's okay, Bear.
I can fix this.

11:54.116 --> 11:56.251
Hmm, that's tight.

11:56.319 --> 11:57.686
(moaning rhythmically)

11:59.322 --> 12:01.056
Note to self.

12:01.124 --> 12:02.825
Why are you doing this?

12:02.892 --> 12:05.127
Are you trying to punish Amanda
for not liking you?

12:05.195 --> 12:06.929
Amanda doesn't seem
to like anyone.

12:06.996 --> 12:08.697
She says she's not
a dog person,

12:08.765 --> 12:11.166
but she's not really a people
person either, is she?

12:11.234 --> 12:13.836
The only reason people aren't
getting along is because of you.

12:13.903 --> 12:15.805
I had this whole night
perfectly planned.

12:15.872 --> 12:18.340
I told you, Ryan, you can't
force them to get along.

12:18.408 --> 12:21.043
Oh, yeah? Watch me.

12:27.616 --> 12:30.518
Listen, I'm sorry if it seemed

12:30.586 --> 12:33.120
like Amanda overreacted
to Wilfred.

12:33.188 --> 12:35.156
It's okay.
It's just a little weird

12:35.223 --> 12:37.424
that she doesn't like dogs,
don't you think?

12:37.492 --> 12:41.095
Actually, there's a reason
for that.

12:41.163 --> 12:43.130
When she was a kid

12:43.198 --> 12:46.967
she was... attacked by a dog.

12:47.035 --> 12:48.236
Oh, my God.

12:48.303 --> 12:50.038
She was walking home
from school,

12:50.106 --> 12:54.576
and this huge Great Dane came
out of nowhere and bit her.

12:54.644 --> 12:55.778
It was really traumatic.

12:55.845 --> 12:57.446
That poor girl.

12:57.514 --> 12:59.148
Where was she bit?

12:59.216 --> 13:02.752
On her... left butt cheek.

13:02.820 --> 13:04.820
There's a huge scar.

13:04.888 --> 13:06.655
She's really sensitive
about it, so...

13:06.723 --> 13:08.924
I won't say anything,
I promise.

13:08.992 --> 13:10.626
I should probably go
check on her.

13:12.228 --> 13:14.862
A Great Dane bit Amanda, huh?

13:14.930 --> 13:17.231
That will never work.

13:17.299 --> 13:18.799
Oh, yeah? Why not?

13:18.867 --> 13:20.334
Because everyone knows

13:20.402 --> 13:22.202
that the Great Dane's
preferred method of attack is

13:22.270 --> 13:23.103
the pin-down
and-slobber-on.

13:23.171 --> 13:24.905
Coincidentally,

13:24.973 --> 13:27.341
that's also Drew's preferred
method of lovemaking.

13:27.409 --> 13:29.042
I know what I'm doing.

13:35.316 --> 13:37.351
Amanda, I am so sorry
about the wine.

13:37.419 --> 13:40.054
And of course I will pay
for any dry cleaning.

13:40.122 --> 13:42.924
No, it's fine, really.
It's okay.

13:42.992 --> 13:45.660
Look, I know I've been testy
tonight, but it's not you.

13:45.728 --> 13:47.762
I don't know if you've heard,
but there's this

13:47.830 --> 13:50.766
Internet video that's sort
of ruining my life right now.

13:50.834 --> 13:54.003
Oh. Uh, no, I haven't heard
anything about it.

13:54.070 --> 13:55.404
I'll send you the link.

13:56.406 --> 13:58.441
Anyway, uh...

13:58.509 --> 14:00.877
I have been
super stressed-out lately.

14:00.945 --> 14:02.946
You know what I do
when I get stressed-out?

14:03.013 --> 14:04.881
There is this amazing spa
on Wilshire.

14:04.949 --> 14:06.216
They have natural hot springs.

14:06.283 --> 14:07.450
We should go sometime.

14:07.518 --> 14:09.719
I would love that.
How about this weekend?

14:09.787 --> 14:11.921
Okay, it's a date.

14:11.989 --> 14:13.656
You know what this calls for?

14:13.724 --> 14:15.458
Another round of wine.

14:17.161 --> 14:21.564
Well, I'm a big enough dog
to admit when I'm wrong.

14:21.632 --> 14:23.732
I guess you <i>can</i> force people
to like each other.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.468
No thanks to you.

14:26.536 --> 14:27.803
Just one question, though.

14:27.871 --> 14:30.472
I've never been allowed
in a spa.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.474
The patrons keep
their clothes on, right?

14:34.410 --> 14:36.010
Oh, wait, no.

14:36.078 --> 14:37.778
It's the opposite, isn't it?

14:42.084 --> 14:43.484
Looks like your lie

14:43.552 --> 14:45.353
about Amanda being bit
in the ass is

14:45.421 --> 14:47.856
about to come back to bite...

14:47.923 --> 14:50.458
Come on, Wilfred,
you're better than that.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:59.360 --> 15:01.594
Well, it seems like you and Jenna
are really hitting it off.

15:01.662 --> 15:03.964
Yeah, I'm really looking
forward to the spa.

15:04.031 --> 15:06.533
(quietly): I wanted to
talk to you about that.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.516
Um, Jenna would never
tell you this herself,

15:09.636 --> 15:12.305
but she really shouldn't be
going to the spa.

15:12.372 --> 15:13.673
Why?

15:13.741 --> 15:17.578
The heat is not good for her;

15:18.145 --> 15:19.413
Heart condition.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.747
Oh, my God.

15:20.814 --> 15:22.243
Why did she agree to go?

15:22.363 --> 15:25.252
She's too stubborn.
She doesn't want it to stop her

15:25.320 --> 15:26.453
from enjoying her life, but...

15:26.521 --> 15:27.688
No. Thank you
for telling me.

15:27.756 --> 15:29.123
I'll just suggest
something else.

15:29.190 --> 15:31.292
That'd probably be
for the best.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.295
Hey, what's the ETA
on the P-I-E?

15:34.362 --> 15:36.930
Coming right up!

15:36.998 --> 15:39.133
Jesus!

15:39.200 --> 15:41.133
Let me guess, drunk Bear
threw the pie in your face?!

15:41.253 --> 15:43.621
Yes, Ryan, right after Bear said

15:43.689 --> 15:46.758
some of the most extraordinarily
hurtful things I've ever heard

15:46.825 --> 15:48.459
come out of someone's mouth.

15:48.527 --> 15:50.395
I am <i>not</i> a butthead!

15:50.462 --> 15:51.963
That's it! Bear's going.

15:52.031 --> 15:55.066
Bear, let go of my paw!

15:55.134 --> 15:57.035
You're hurting me!
Wilfred, drop it!

15:57.102 --> 15:59.571
Hey, is everything
okay in here?

15:59.639 --> 16:01.773
At the hell?!
Wilfred!

16:01.841 --> 16:03.375
Bear, you could've
broken my back!

16:03.442 --> 16:04.876
Amanda, help me up, please?

16:04.944 --> 16:06.845
Get the dog away from me!

16:06.912 --> 16:08.179
Where's your scar?

16:08.247 --> 16:10.115
What scar?

16:10.183 --> 16:12.650
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

16:12.718 --> 16:14.419
What-what are you talking about?
Oh, look,

16:14.487 --> 16:15.821
it looks like somebody
got into the pie.

16:15.888 --> 16:17.522
Maybe we should go for
ice cream or something.

16:17.590 --> 16:19.324
Don't be mad, but Ryan
told us about that dog

16:19.392 --> 16:21.126
that bit you on your butt
when you were little.

16:21.194 --> 16:24.129
The dog that...? What?
Why would you tell them that?

16:24.197 --> 16:27.032
He just, he wanted us to understand
why you don't like dogs.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.034
And we totally get it.

16:29.102 --> 16:30.436
A bite on the butt?

16:30.503 --> 16:31.503
That's what you told them?

16:31.571 --> 16:32.571
What the hell is
wrong with you?

16:32.638 --> 16:34.139
Don't talk to Ryan like that.

16:34.207 --> 16:36.474
Stay out of this, Squishy Tits.
Yikes.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.109
You lied to your
friends about me?

16:38.177 --> 16:39.343
I...

16:39.411 --> 16:40.444
Uh-oh, Ryan.

16:40.512 --> 16:42.346
Amanda was caught
with her pants down,

16:42.414 --> 16:44.949
and now you being caught
with your pan...

16:45.016 --> 16:46.784
Seriously, Wilfred?
You are off tonight.

16:46.852 --> 16:48.385
Look, I didn't realize
that my history with dogs was

16:48.453 --> 16:49.686
so important to all of you.

16:49.754 --> 16:51.054
But why don't I just save us
all some time

16:51.122 --> 16:52.522
and tell you the truth?

16:52.590 --> 16:54.224
Amanda, you don't have to...
No-no-no-no-no-no,

16:54.292 --> 16:56.526
we're all real good
friends now, right?

16:56.594 --> 16:58.495
You want to know why
I don't like dogs?

16:58.563 --> 16:59.930
Let's share.

16:59.997 --> 17:02.433
When I was eight, I used
to spend every Sunday

17:02.500 --> 17:04.234
at my grandfather's house.

17:04.301 --> 17:08.705
He had two Blue Tick hounds,
Sam and Finnigan.

17:08.773 --> 17:12.644
We used to take them for walks
and go for swims in the lake.

17:12.712 --> 17:16.315
I... I looked forward
to it all week.

17:16.382 --> 17:20.286
Then one Sunday,
my mom dropped me off,

17:20.354 --> 17:22.789
and I went inside the house,

17:22.856 --> 17:28.328
and there was my grandfather
lying on the kitchen floor.

17:28.395 --> 17:32.499
He'd died of a heart attack.

17:32.566 --> 17:34.967
(voice breaks): He'd been
there for about a week,

17:35.035 --> 17:37.069
and the dogs,
they got so hungry that

17:37.137 --> 17:41.173
they'd eaten both his legs
and half his face!

17:43.076 --> 17:45.745
(slurps drool)

17:45.813 --> 17:48.181
And that's the last time
I remember seeing my grandpa.

17:48.249 --> 17:49.849
So thank you for the reminder!

17:49.917 --> 17:51.918
Excuse me!

17:56.891 --> 17:58.726
So sad.

17:58.793 --> 17:59.960
(knocking)

18:00.028 --> 18:02.296
Amanda, can I come in?

18:02.363 --> 18:06.100
Drew and Jenna took off.
It's, it's just me.

18:07.102 --> 18:08.903
Wilfred!

18:08.971 --> 18:12.273
No, no, it's okay.
I get it now.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.176
I was lying on
the bed here crying,

18:15.243 --> 18:17.878
and Wilfred just came up
and cuddled up to me.

18:17.945 --> 18:19.846
It was like he knew
I was upset.

18:19.914 --> 18:25.684
And then, I don't know,
everything felt... better.

18:25.752 --> 18:27.453
There, there.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.354
Let's get those tears
off your face.

18:29.422 --> 18:30.655
(sucking breath)

18:30.723 --> 18:32.991
(chuckles)

18:33.058 --> 18:36.995
Amanda, I shouldn't have lied
about the dog attack.

18:37.062 --> 18:39.918
Yeah. Jenna doesn't have

18:40.038 --> 18:41.433
a heart condition either,
does she?

18:43.435 --> 18:46.137
I can't believe I called
her "Squishy Tits."

18:46.204 --> 18:48.105
Does she hate me now?

18:48.173 --> 18:51.242
No, no, she doesn't...

18:51.310 --> 18:52.844
She'll, she'll get over it.

18:59.017 --> 19:01.786
I'm sorry about everything.

19:01.853 --> 19:04.856
I just wanted you
and Jenna to get along.

19:04.924 --> 19:06.874
Because if you didn't,

19:06.994 --> 19:09.228
I was worried that maybe
that would mean

19:09.265 --> 19:09.894
that you and I...

19:09.962 --> 19:13.231
Ryan, you never have to worry
about you and me.

19:13.299 --> 19:14.866
We're good.

19:14.934 --> 19:16.701
Really?
Yeah!

19:16.768 --> 19:18.536
Anyone who's gone
to all that trouble

19:18.603 --> 19:19.837
must care a lot.

19:19.905 --> 19:21.785
But I shouldn't have tried
to force it.

19:21.905 --> 19:24.942
I mean, hey, look at you
and Wilfred.

19:25.010 --> 19:28.613
I know, it's weird, right?

19:28.681 --> 19:31.249
Ever since the incident
with my grandfather,

19:31.317 --> 19:33.251
I've never felt comfortable
around dogs.

19:33.319 --> 19:37.889
I've always associated them
with this feeling of... doom.

19:37.957 --> 19:41.626
But now with Wilfred,
I don't feel afraid any more.

19:41.694 --> 19:43.194
I'm glad.

19:43.262 --> 19:45.430
Wilfred...

19:45.498 --> 19:46.698
means a lot to me.

19:46.766 --> 19:49.067
Come here, Wilfred.

19:50.804 --> 19:52.838
(inhaling)

19:52.906 --> 19:56.806
(sighs)
Nice to finally meet you.

19:57.344 --> 19:58.711
(sniffing deeply, sighs)

20:10.344 --> 20:13.980
So I hear Amanda and
Jenna are going out

20:14.048 --> 20:14.990
to dinner this weekend.

20:15.107 --> 20:16.407
Yup.

20:16.475 --> 20:19.477
And I had absolutely nothing
to do with it.

20:19.544 --> 20:21.312
I'm proud of you, Ryan.

20:21.379 --> 20:22.680
It's good that you're
no longer trying

20:22.747 --> 20:25.115
to control things.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.184
(TV station changes)

20:32.549 --> 20:34.216
Well, like any alcoholic,

20:34.284 --> 20:37.186
Bear had to bottom out
first, you know?

20:37.254 --> 20:39.121
But I'm pleased to report.

20:39.189 --> 20:40.623
Bear is back in the program.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.124
Got a new sponsor.

20:42.192 --> 20:43.526
And I really think

20:43.593 --> 20:46.562
it's a step in
the right direction.

20:46.630 --> 20:49.198
Bear's sponsor is
an origami swan?

20:54.152 --> 20:57.645
Look, you and I both know the paper
swan can't actually talk to Bear.

20:57.765 --> 20:59.974
But if it helps Bear, that's
all that matters, yeah?

21:04.458 --> 21:06.411
I'm very proud of you.
