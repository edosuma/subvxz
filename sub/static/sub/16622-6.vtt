00:00.009 --> 00:01.893
Previously on "Secrets and Lies"...

00:01.903 --> 00:03.619
- Did you kill my wife?
- What are you talking about?

00:03.629 --> 00:06.252
You set up an account so you could
siphon money from this firm!

00:06.262 --> 00:08.246
- That's insane!
- Neil, leave.

00:08.256 --> 00:09.325
I quit.

00:09.335 --> 00:11.390
- Who is she?
- It's none of your damn business.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.906
- You're married to my sister.
- Then talk to her.

00:12.916 --> 00:14.970
- I'm talking to you!
- I moved out.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.047
You're single now, right?
Is that what I heard?

00:17.149 --> 00:19.282
I told Patrick that you and Greg split.

00:19.351 --> 00:21.218
I should have known that
he would tell Melanie.

00:21.228 --> 00:23.545
Tech division showed me footage
of a woman outside the building

00:23.555 --> 00:25.748
a few hours before the murder,
but no one could I.D. her.

00:25.758 --> 00:28.158
- I'm N.Y.P.D.
- You need to stay out of sight

00:28.260 --> 00:29.860
and stay out of my investigation.

00:29.962 --> 00:32.595
Either place that cop under
arrest or you're suspended.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.098
He has a bench warrant
out for his arrest.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.446
I would leave before the cops get here.

00:42.107 --> 00:43.974
I had to get
that cop out of here.

00:44.076 --> 00:45.942
You're in enough trouble.

00:46.044 --> 00:49.246
What the hell are you thinking?
Cornell just cleared you.

00:49.348 --> 00:50.671
You read her wrong.

00:50.681 --> 00:52.082
Danny says she won't stop looking at me

00:52.151 --> 00:53.784
until she puts someone else in cuffs.

00:53.852 --> 00:55.886
Why would you listen to
anything her spy has to say?

00:55.954 --> 00:57.320
Because he's a cop.

00:57.389 --> 01:00.056
And I think he knows better than
you what that woman is thinking.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.858
- Have you just stopped caring?
- Have you?

01:01.927 --> 01:05.352
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What's going on with your marriage?

01:07.032 --> 01:09.866
If you weren't so busy taking care of
everyone else instead of paying attention

01:09.902 --> 01:11.460
to what's going on in
your relationship...

01:11.470 --> 01:13.197
Greg filed for divorce.

01:15.607 --> 01:18.307
I've had the papers for
a couple weeks now.

01:19.891 --> 01:22.345
- Why?
- Just leave it alone, Eric.

01:28.987 --> 01:30.500
Kate's gone.

01:33.325 --> 01:35.241
You can still fix this.

01:35.374 --> 01:37.594
You got to decide what's important.

01:37.663 --> 01:39.296
You can't have it all.

01:39.364 --> 01:41.198
It ain't fair.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.366
It ain't right. It just is.

01:44.307 --> 01:46.156
I want kids.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.470
He doesn't.

01:48.774 --> 01:50.707
How do I fix that?

01:51.407 --> 01:53.410
- Mandy...
- Don't. Don't do that.

01:53.512 --> 01:55.879
I don't want your pity.

01:57.216 --> 01:59.716
This is why I kept it to myself.

02:01.607 --> 02:03.917
- I just need to get over it.
- There's still time.

02:03.927 --> 02:06.582
- You can have babies with someone else.
- Maybe for you. You're a man.

02:06.592 --> 02:08.888
You can have them whenever you want.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:20.786 --> 02:22.733
You would've been a great dad.

02:23.542 --> 02:26.009
You were always there for me...

02:26.111 --> 02:28.945
Especially when Dad wasn't.

02:29.047 --> 02:31.081
But I'm a big girl now.

02:31.183 --> 02:33.214
I can handle my own life.

02:51.703 --> 02:52.836
Problem?

02:54.039 --> 02:57.572
That's Mr. Peterson.
He says he has a meeting.

02:57.676 --> 02:59.205
With Kate.

03:00.779 --> 03:03.346
All right. I'll take care of it.

03:04.383 --> 03:06.383
Mr. Peterson.

03:06.958 --> 03:08.518
- I'm Eric Warner.
- Oh, hey, hi.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.620
I understand you have
a meeting with Kate.

03:10.689 --> 03:13.390
Uh, she's unavailable,
so can I help you?

03:13.458 --> 03:15.959
Yeah, I-I'd rather deal with her.
Can I... Can I reschedule?

03:16.028 --> 03:17.460
What's the meeting about?

03:18.697 --> 03:20.764
- Uh, investments.
- Mm.

03:20.774 --> 03:23.433
- Um... I drove a long way to see her.
- Are you a reporter?

03:23.502 --> 03:25.669
- W-what? No.
- What's your angle?

03:25.737 --> 03:27.512
Why do you want to meet with my wife?

03:27.522 --> 03:30.772
Why are you interrogating me?
I've done nothing wrong.

03:34.261 --> 03:35.821
Had to be sure.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.351
My wife died two weeks ago.

03:43.322 --> 03:45.555
I'm... I'm so sorry.

03:45.691 --> 03:47.057
Um...

03:48.126 --> 03:50.593
- What happened?
- She was murdered.

03:53.899 --> 03:56.446
So, why did you want to meet with her?

03:56.543 --> 03:57.635
I...

03:58.203 --> 04:00.003
Like I said, i-investments.

04:00.105 --> 04:01.504
Um...

04:01.606 --> 04:03.006
I-I need to go.

04:03.461 --> 04:06.843
Mr. Peterson, my wife
didn't handle investments.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.646
So what was this really about?

04:09.715 --> 04:12.345
I'm so sorry for your loss... truly.

04:21.994 --> 04:24.394
I don't eavesdrop on my
customers, Detective.

04:24.496 --> 04:28.622
That's you... close enough to
hear exactly what's being said.

04:32.237 --> 04:34.304
Her lunch guest was
threatening her about a man.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.106
What did they say, exactly?

04:36.208 --> 04:37.674
I wasn't listening.

04:37.776 --> 04:40.477
But those two cats were
fighting over some guy.

04:40.579 --> 04:42.311
That, I know.

04:42.321 --> 04:45.949
It's hard to do a job well if you
can't hear what your customers want.

04:47.586 --> 04:50.587
I've been waiting tables for
10 years. I do all right.

04:50.655 --> 04:53.255
Did you hear Kate call
the woman by name?

04:53.606 --> 04:55.086
Not that I remember.

04:55.404 --> 04:57.360
Is there anything else?
My shift starts in an hour.

04:57.462 --> 04:58.928
Please go.

05:01.767 --> 05:03.366
I got a bolo hit on that New York cop.

05:03.468 --> 05:04.834
The Major wants it checked out.

05:04.936 --> 05:06.603
Danny Voss is staying at a motel nearby.

05:06.705 --> 05:09.834
- I can take it if you're busy.
- I got it. Thanks.

05:10.002 --> 05:12.142
Look, I-I know it's...
It's a tough day for you.

05:12.244 --> 05:14.744
- I heard two years ago that...
- I got it covered.

05:14.846 --> 05:16.312
Okay.

05:16.415 --> 05:18.114
Do you need any help?

05:20.452 --> 05:22.185
You coming?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.460
Motel clerk I.D.'d Voss from a six-pack.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.647
Gave me a passkey. Says he's in room 18.

05:32.657 --> 05:34.199
Put this on.

05:34.466 --> 05:37.667
- Detectives don't wear armor.
- Unless we breach hot.

05:37.769 --> 05:40.737
Everything I've heard about
Voss says he's stand-up police.

05:40.839 --> 05:42.038
Do you really think he'd shoot at us?

05:42.140 --> 05:43.973
He's looking for his missing daughter,

05:44.009 --> 05:47.259
and I don't think he'll go
quietly until he finds her.

05:49.381 --> 05:51.815
- Happy?
- Ecstatic.

06:05.230 --> 06:07.230
Danny's long gone.

06:07.332 --> 06:08.909
Coffee's still hot.

06:08.919 --> 06:12.569
- He must have known we were coming.
- Or somebody tipped him.

06:14.139 --> 06:15.839
And you think that someone is me?

06:15.941 --> 06:17.307
Wouldn't put it past you.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.142
You used Voss' kid as leverage

06:19.244 --> 06:21.377
to make him spy on your prime suspect.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.545
That's ruthless.

06:22.647 --> 06:24.814
No, Detective, that's resourceful.

06:26.218 --> 06:27.952
Hand over your phone.

06:28.987 --> 06:31.621
You want proof that I didn't
warn Danny we were coming?

06:31.723 --> 06:33.207
It'd be a start.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.959
After all, you gave him
plenty of time to bail

06:36.027 --> 06:38.777
by distracting me with
a vest I didn't need.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.600
See anything in my text
history to prove your theory?

06:47.572 --> 06:49.572
You just brought me along to
prove that you obeyed an order

06:49.641 --> 06:51.241
so you don't get ripped by the Major.

06:51.343 --> 06:54.777
Why would I bother if you're
not his eyes and ears?

06:58.783 --> 07:00.517
Pick another stooge.

07:12.464 --> 07:14.904
_

07:21.517 --> 07:23.149
So, let me get this straight.

07:23.184 --> 07:25.851
Danny Voss eluded you.
Is that what I'm hearing?

07:25.920 --> 07:28.770
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not talking to you.

07:29.023 --> 07:31.023
Voss is a street cop.

07:31.092 --> 07:33.792
Probably greased a few
palms at the motel.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.528
Have you I.D.'d the woman from
the Warner building footage yet?

07:40.835 --> 07:43.569
I'm sorry. Were you talking
to me? I couldn't tell.

07:43.638 --> 07:45.337
You know, you're gonna look real nice

07:45.406 --> 07:47.856
in that new uniform, directing traffic.

07:49.777 --> 07:51.710
Not yet, but the unidentified female

07:51.746 --> 07:54.713
did have lunch with our victim
the same day she was killed.

07:54.782 --> 07:57.383
Find out who she is and sit her down.

08:00.888 --> 08:03.189
Ralston's not finding out
anything. It's my case.

08:03.291 --> 08:04.723
It's my unit.

08:08.162 --> 08:10.396
Frankly, I'm a little worried about you.

08:10.464 --> 08:12.031
Are you gonna be okay today?

08:12.099 --> 08:13.732
Why wouldn't I be?

08:13.801 --> 08:17.536
Stress, fatigue, anxiety...
All cop-killers.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.907
You should take the day,
maybe talk to someone.

08:22.009 --> 08:24.043
I'm fine. Anything else?

08:24.906 --> 08:27.880
Yeah. Your husband stopped
by earlier, looking for you.

08:27.982 --> 08:29.181
"Ex-husband."

08:29.283 --> 08:32.083
- Did he leave a message?
- No.

08:32.153 --> 08:34.352
Must not have been important, then.

08:42.597 --> 08:45.764
So, I guess it's true...
I'm your errand boy.

08:45.866 --> 08:47.233
Ran into the security guard.

08:47.301 --> 08:49.235
He said to bring this to you right away.

08:52.677 --> 08:55.007
So, who is Mark Peterson?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.593
Don't worry about it.

08:58.379 --> 09:00.779
W... y-you don't trust me anymore?

09:00.848 --> 09:02.948
Of course I trust you.
You're my brother.

09:03.050 --> 09:04.750
But...

09:04.885 --> 09:07.052
I don't trust your wife.

09:07.154 --> 09:09.221
What the hell, Eric?

09:09.290 --> 09:10.956
I don't want Melanie in
my personal business.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.091
Why?

09:12.159 --> 09:13.525
If you have to ask, that's a problem.

09:13.628 --> 09:14.793
No, not to me, man.

09:14.862 --> 09:16.161
She is my wife, which makes
her part of this family.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.463
Then why doesn't she act like it?

09:17.531 --> 09:19.765
Your sister's marriage tanks,
and she uses it like a hammer.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.133
How do you think Mandy felt?

09:21.235 --> 09:23.035
The same way that my wife feels

09:23.137 --> 09:25.504
every time the two of
you look down on her.

09:25.573 --> 09:27.873
You act like she doesn't even exist.

09:28.376 --> 09:30.042
I don't see how.

09:30.144 --> 09:31.677
She's just so damn loud.

09:33.481 --> 09:34.980
I get it.

09:36.317 --> 09:38.017
You're the boss, right?

09:39.520 --> 09:42.770
So, what, do I kiss your ring
or your ass before I go?

09:45.526 --> 09:49.228
I have a right to decide
who knows what about me.

09:51.198 --> 09:52.631
I guess it's my turn.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.366
What are you talking about?

09:55.703 --> 09:59.438
You cut Dad off first,
your little bromance with Neil.

09:59.540 --> 10:01.307
Where is he? Have you...
have you checked in?

10:01.409 --> 10:03.242
Has he?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.810
No.

10:04.879 --> 10:06.111
So, clearly, I'm next.

10:06.180 --> 10:09.081
I'll just save you some trouble. Huh?

10:18.759 --> 10:21.260
Your father called... Twice.

10:21.362 --> 10:23.529
Should I get him back for you?

10:23.597 --> 10:24.992
No.

10:25.247 --> 10:28.033
It's not like you to
hold a grudge, Eric.

10:28.135 --> 10:30.903
Whatever he's done,
you should talk to him.

10:30.971 --> 10:32.871
I'd like for you to
collect the firm's mail

10:32.940 --> 10:36.575
and start storing it in my
office from now on, please.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.444
No problem.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.180
Are you looking for something specific?

10:42.583 --> 10:45.684
I'm looking for a statement
from a bank we don't use.

10:45.825 --> 10:48.087
Someone set up an account
without authorization?

10:48.155 --> 10:49.888
That's what I'm trying to find out.

10:49.990 --> 10:53.425
I'll start sorting the mail
right away... discreetly.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.294
Also...

10:55.329 --> 10:57.830
See what you can find
out about Mark Peterson.

10:57.898 --> 10:59.998
He claimed to have a
meeting with Kate today.

11:02.269 --> 11:03.969
He did.

11:04.004 --> 11:06.939
Looks like Kate scheduled
the meeting herself.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.708
There aren't any notes on
what it was about, though.

11:09.777 --> 11:13.178
Any other appointments on her calendar?

11:13.280 --> 11:16.181
There's one with the S.E.C...

11:16.217 --> 11:18.317
And another one with the I.R.S.

11:26.327 --> 11:29.461
Reach out to a few headhunters today.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.164
We need to hire a new
compliance officer right away.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.866
I'll make some calls.

11:50.885 --> 11:52.684
I wiped it clean already.

11:52.787 --> 11:55.487
I trust you know how to
dispose of it properly?

11:55.589 --> 11:57.256
Thanks for the warning. I owe you.

11:57.358 --> 11:59.658
It's the last one you're gonna get.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.028
Go home, take the stand
in your narcotics trial,

12:03.097 --> 12:04.329
then come back and find your daughter.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.165
No, I'm not going
anywhere without my kid.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.566
She's an adult.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.302
If she was a minor, the judge
would Grant you emergency leave.

12:10.404 --> 12:11.837
- You're out of moves here.
- You know what?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.706
Now... now that you mention it,
without Carly, I'm S.O.L.

12:14.809 --> 12:15.974
Can you reach out to vice?

12:16.076 --> 12:18.010
- No.
- Look. No, no, no.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.311
To nab Carly,

12:19.380 --> 12:21.814
I need the escort service
that sells her, okay?

12:21.849 --> 12:23.115
Just give me that, and we're done.

12:23.217 --> 12:25.284
We're done already.
I stuck my neck out for you.

12:25.352 --> 12:28.061
Oh, because I lost access to your perp?

12:29.256 --> 12:32.090
Not for nothing...
Eric doesn't act like a doer.

12:32.193 --> 12:34.126
You work drugs, not bodies.

12:34.228 --> 12:36.462
Fine. You chase your own tail.

12:37.731 --> 12:39.790
Just help me find Rachel, please.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.768
No. And if I see you again,
I put you in cuffs.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.936
You're tearing Patrick apart.

13:08.109 --> 13:09.113
How?

13:09.123 --> 13:11.539
When you told him he had to
choose between me and you.

13:11.549 --> 13:12.648
When did I do that?

13:14.819 --> 13:16.285
What was my husband supposed to think

13:16.320 --> 13:17.820
when you told him you couldn't trust me?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.522
Just... That.

13:19.557 --> 13:21.991
You can't expect a man
not to talk to his wife.

13:22.026 --> 13:23.893
I can when it's my personal business.

13:23.961 --> 13:26.729
Oh. So you never complained
about Patrick to Kate?

13:26.764 --> 13:29.532
Never dissed the family
screw-up to your little wife?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.811
- That's different.
- 'Cause it's you or because it's Kate?

13:33.730 --> 13:35.531
That's right... I didn't
measure up when she was alive.

13:35.599 --> 13:38.358
Oh, it's... It's not a competition.

13:39.336 --> 13:41.403
I'm a scrapper, Eric.

13:42.335 --> 13:44.472
I fight for what I want.

13:45.071 --> 13:47.142
Never thought I'd have to fight you.

13:49.201 --> 13:51.513
You hurt Patrick...

13:51.615 --> 13:52.814
I'll hurt you.

13:52.883 --> 13:55.183
Big words...

13:55.252 --> 13:58.687
From a loud, obnoxious little brat.

14:00.558 --> 14:02.658
Hmm.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.013
Jealous?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.361
Well, Patrick tells me everything,

14:06.430 --> 14:08.931
and all you got from
precious little Kate

14:09.033 --> 14:11.366
were a bunch of lies.

14:14.204 --> 14:15.637
Maybe.

14:16.907 --> 14:22.118
But, you know, Kate was an
accomplished, educated woman.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.914
And all you are is...

14:26.016 --> 14:27.249
Convenient.

14:28.095 --> 14:30.018
Please excuse me.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.987
I have work to do.

14:44.602 --> 14:46.134
Problem?

14:47.438 --> 14:48.870
Hi, baby.

14:48.973 --> 14:50.639
Nothing I can fix.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.978
Uh, I'm sorry, but I've been
unable to find a reason

14:56.046 --> 14:58.614
why Kate would schedule a
meeting with Mark Peterson.

14:58.682 --> 15:00.315
Who is he?

15:02.820 --> 15:07.055
A civil engineer who works for the
city of Charleston, south Carolina,

15:07.124 --> 15:09.524
where he lives with his wife and kids.

15:18.702 --> 15:20.381
Who's that?

15:22.473 --> 15:25.474
Mark's wife, Belinda Peterson.

15:27.745 --> 15:30.045
Okay. Thank you.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.697
- I'm not ready to talk to you.
- I know.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.644
You look well.

15:52.155 --> 15:54.102
I stopped using.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.871
Even cleared up my skin.

15:55.939 --> 15:57.706
I can see that.

15:57.775 --> 16:00.142
I've been clean 18 months, Andrea.

16:00.244 --> 16:01.677
That's good.

16:01.745 --> 16:03.345
Don't get excited or anything.

16:05.816 --> 16:07.582
Is your father home?

16:07.685 --> 16:08.884
Nope.

16:09.623 --> 16:12.521
- He left you alone?
- Dad has this new blanket.

16:12.589 --> 16:15.064
She's like 30 and makes him laugh.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.759
They can't keep their
hands off each other.

16:18.829 --> 16:21.879
I guess he trusts I can be
left alone for an hour.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.867
I want your sobriety
to go well this time.

16:27.671 --> 16:29.805
Way to throw my failures
back in my face.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.673
That's not what I meant.

16:35.112 --> 16:36.411
So, what, Mom?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.402
You're just gonna leave? Hmm?

16:38.412 --> 16:41.762
You want to fight. I'm tired
of being your punching bag.

16:57.335 --> 16:58.586
Hey.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.136
I just wanted to apologize for earlier.

17:01.238 --> 17:02.738
Oh, forget it.

17:02.806 --> 17:05.574
Did you find out the name of the
woman that Kate had lunch with?

17:05.675 --> 17:08.279
Well, the canvass turned up zip.
No one at the restaurant knew her.

17:08.289 --> 17:10.579
Well, the restaurant's in a
hotel on a street full of them.

17:10.646 --> 17:14.470
Show the desk clerks a picture of
the woman and find me her name.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.117
Why do you think she's not a local?

17:16.185 --> 17:19.950
Letters that were sent to Kate's P.O.
Box were from adoption agencies.

17:19.960 --> 17:23.613
She was pregnant. She had to be
looking for the boy that she gave up.

17:23.623 --> 17:26.294
- Do you think she found him?
- I think she found the adoptive mother,

17:26.329 --> 17:29.041
which is why I want to speak with
her sooner rather than later.

17:29.051 --> 17:30.065
All right.

17:34.905 --> 17:37.506
I understand you and Jennifer
had a very nice chat.

17:37.608 --> 17:39.141
Why would you leave her alone?

17:39.243 --> 17:40.742
She could relapse, Ethan.

17:42.246 --> 17:44.746
- That's not why I'm here.
- I don't care.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.916
You need to watch Jennifer,
not bang your new girlfriend.

17:48.018 --> 17:49.251
Andrea.

17:49.353 --> 17:51.143
You should take a moment.

17:51.302 --> 17:52.817
You're enraged.

17:52.958 --> 17:55.716
That's not an appropriate response
to anything that's happened.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.679
Stop shrinking me!

18:11.875 --> 18:14.576
Don't come to my work.

18:16.079 --> 18:17.279
So you won't digress,

18:17.347 --> 18:20.159
Jennifer and I have come
up with a recovery plan.

18:20.169 --> 18:21.544
Without me?

18:22.786 --> 18:25.821
I have met someone, but
that's a topic for another day.

18:25.889 --> 18:27.422
Well, it's none of my business.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.591
We both know that's not true.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.828
I love you, but I find it
impossible to live with you.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.729
Sweet-talker.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.769
What's today, Andrea?

18:42.072 --> 18:44.639
I'm breaking in a new partner.

18:44.741 --> 18:46.508
Everything's fine.

18:46.577 --> 18:48.577
Well, that's probably what set you off.

18:48.679 --> 18:51.580
I don't need therapy, Ethan.

18:51.648 --> 18:53.172
Yes, you do.

18:53.313 --> 18:55.851
You're this close to an episode.

18:55.919 --> 18:57.652
What's today?

19:01.725 --> 19:04.593
You know nobody's gonna
answer their door for us.

19:09.633 --> 19:12.000
Split it. I can be home
for dinner by 6:00 P.M.

19:12.035 --> 19:15.345
We're supposed to do follow-up
interviews together.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.740
You really think anyone here
is gonna cop to seeing the murder?

19:18.809 --> 19:19.975
No.

19:20.010 --> 19:22.377
My daughter just got
accepted to Princeton,

19:22.446 --> 19:24.346
and I'm taking all the credit.

19:24.448 --> 19:26.288
Congratulations.

19:26.632 --> 19:29.982
Want to come?
There's gonna be cobbler.

19:33.223 --> 19:36.758
Ethan wants to divorce me.

19:39.096 --> 19:42.497
Tell him no. Tell him I
said so... damn fool.

19:44.968 --> 19:47.437
Wish it were that easy.

19:47.871 --> 19:50.005
Putting your kids before
your marriage is dumb.

19:50.073 --> 19:51.706
Kids grow up. They leave.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.075
Plus, he loves you.

19:56.346 --> 19:58.113
You married an idiot, Andrea.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.150
I'll tell him you said so.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.180
Police.

20:35.452 --> 20:36.913
Unggggh!

20:57.007 --> 20:58.306
911. What is your emergency?

20:58.408 --> 21:01.543
Detective Andrea Cornell, badge 764.

21:01.611 --> 21:03.178
Put me on the patch! Officer down!

21:05.315 --> 21:06.748
Ivan.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.083
Ivan.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.365
You stay with me!

21:22.199 --> 21:23.665
No! God!!

21:23.767 --> 21:25.700
You stay with me!

21:25.802 --> 21:26.835
No!

21:28.538 --> 21:30.872
Why are you so angry?

21:33.276 --> 21:35.377
Dale's murder is still open.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.913
Well, you speak for the dead.

21:39.016 --> 21:41.149
It's a calling.

21:41.251 --> 21:43.585
Dale's family wants to
know who killed him.

21:43.687 --> 21:46.021
And I can't give them that.

21:47.424 --> 21:48.890
Why not?

21:48.959 --> 21:52.360
He was my partner, and I
can't investigate his murder.

21:52.462 --> 21:53.895
It's against regulations.

21:53.997 --> 21:55.730
That's never stopped you before.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.436
If I look in his file, I get dinged.

22:01.538 --> 22:04.072
I ask a detective for an
update, I get dinged.

22:04.174 --> 22:06.207
And the case stays open.

22:07.611 --> 22:09.744
That must be frustrating.

22:09.846 --> 22:12.447
Ivan Dale, Kate Warner...

22:12.549 --> 22:14.449
They won't let me do my job.

22:14.551 --> 22:16.484
They keep getting in my way.

22:18.555 --> 22:20.231
Who's stopping you?

22:21.224 --> 22:22.757
Everyone.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.362
- What do you want, Mr. Warner?
- May I come in?

22:52.372 --> 22:54.390
- No.
- There are things we need to discuss.

22:54.492 --> 22:55.925
I don't think you want
to do that out here.

22:55.994 --> 22:58.894
You should leave,
or I'm gonna call the police.

22:59.264 --> 23:00.263
Use my phone.

23:00.365 --> 23:02.098
But right after, Charlotte homicide

23:02.167 --> 23:03.866
will be talking to you and your wife.

23:03.935 --> 23:05.602
How's that sound?

23:05.704 --> 23:07.237
Let him in, Mark.

23:11.843 --> 23:14.907
- Would you like something to drink?
- This isn't a social call.

23:14.917 --> 23:17.714
Okay. I'm... I'm nervous.
I-I don't know what to say.

23:17.749 --> 23:20.783
You can start by telling me what
you were doing at my building

23:20.885 --> 23:23.235
the same day that my wife was killed.

23:25.690 --> 23:27.078
I went there to warn her off.

23:27.088 --> 23:29.238
- You threatened my wife?
- No.

23:31.196 --> 23:33.396
I know how it sounds, and...

23:33.498 --> 23:35.698
I would take it all back if I could.

23:35.767 --> 23:37.934
I-I want to tell him everything.

23:38.003 --> 23:41.838
I won't lie...
My past isn't pretty, but...

23:41.906 --> 23:45.508
Charlie needs to hear that I
would've kept him if I could.

23:46.319 --> 23:48.878
I loved him so much.

23:48.947 --> 23:52.348
He was mine. He was perfect
and beautiful and...

23:52.417 --> 23:54.617
- I mean, you must...
- The answer's no.

23:55.382 --> 23:58.288
- What?
- He's not yours.

23:58.390 --> 24:00.056
Charlie's my son.

24:00.959 --> 24:02.660
I know that.

24:03.495 --> 24:06.329
I-I only had him for a little while...

24:06.431 --> 24:08.131
Just long enough to watch him sleep

24:08.199 --> 24:11.100
and to fall in love, but...

24:11.169 --> 24:14.304
Look, you've had him for 20 years.

24:14.372 --> 24:16.306
He wouldn't know me if he
passed me on the street.

24:16.408 --> 24:18.041
He can meet you later.

24:18.109 --> 24:19.342
If he wants.

24:19.411 --> 24:21.044
Charlie's in college,
and he's working hard,

24:21.112 --> 24:24.147
and you would just be a...
distraction for him.

24:24.249 --> 24:25.982
When I talked to you and your husband,

24:26.051 --> 24:28.651
- I thought that you were okay with...
- I changed my mind.

24:28.752 --> 24:30.286
Stay away from my family.

24:30.322 --> 24:31.821
I'm Charlie's mother.

24:31.856 --> 24:35.491
I will decide if and when he meets you.

24:35.593 --> 24:37.260
No. Please.

24:38.630 --> 24:41.431
You loved Charlie when I couldn't.

24:41.499 --> 24:43.433
And from everything that you've told me,

24:43.501 --> 24:46.302
he is smart and wonderful.

24:46.371 --> 24:49.605
And because you chose him,
I am so grateful to you.

24:51.476 --> 24:54.143
Please just think about it, okay?

24:57.082 --> 24:58.581
Look, I have to go.

24:58.650 --> 25:01.804
My husband's firm is celebrating
him tonight. I'm really late.

25:01.814 --> 25:03.653
Please just think about it.

25:07.559 --> 25:10.793
I know Kate. She would
have gone to that roof with you.

25:10.895 --> 25:13.296
- Did you kill my wife?
- Whoa. Let's take a minute.

25:13.365 --> 25:14.676
- Answer me!
- No!

25:14.686 --> 25:16.572
I... I didn't kill her.

25:16.582 --> 25:18.035
You met with Kate earlier,
at the restaurant,

25:18.045 --> 25:19.544
so why'd you come to the building?

25:19.613 --> 25:21.613
Don't say anything else, Belinda.
Let's just get a lawyer.

25:21.682 --> 25:22.547
I didn't do it.

25:22.616 --> 25:24.382
I saw you on the security tapes.

25:24.484 --> 25:25.917
The cops are looking at
the exact same footage.

25:25.986 --> 25:27.552
- Explain to me why you were there.
- That's enough!

25:27.654 --> 25:30.388
- Why?!
- Stop talking.

25:30.457 --> 25:31.790
Mark.

25:31.892 --> 25:33.317
Y-you don't think that I...

25:33.327 --> 25:36.377
You were upset. I-I couldn't
even reason with you.

25:37.464 --> 25:40.814
Is that why you scheduled a
meeting with Kate yesterday?

25:41.735 --> 25:43.834
I wanted her to meet Charlie.

25:45.272 --> 25:48.240
- You went behind my back.
- I had to.

25:48.308 --> 25:50.175
Our son had a right to know his mother.

25:50.277 --> 25:52.277
I'm his mother, Mark.

25:52.379 --> 25:54.595
Kate gave birth to him.

25:56.016 --> 25:59.417
Look, we talked about this
when we decided to adopt him.

25:59.486 --> 26:02.608
We swore that we would
never be those people.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.367
For most of his life,

26:15.435 --> 26:18.103
all I could think about
was the knock at the door.

26:18.171 --> 26:20.939
And then the minute you stop worrying...

26:21.041 --> 26:23.275
It's why you were angry.

26:24.978 --> 26:28.313
You didn't want Kate near your son.

26:32.185 --> 26:34.986
Check the security feed.
Look at the tapes.

26:35.122 --> 26:37.656
It... they will say when I left.

26:37.758 --> 26:39.457
That's too bad.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.428
- Because someone erased the footage.
- What?

26:46.266 --> 26:47.866
I think I know who did.

27:13.894 --> 27:17.429
It was a woman.
She was blond and very thin...

27:17.531 --> 27:20.365
Very big-busted. She was...

27:20.467 --> 27:25.670
She was wearing this gold...
gold lamé tight, tight dress

27:25.706 --> 27:29.426
and had a lot of makeup and
high heels and jewelry.

27:29.436 --> 27:31.810
She was... She was hard to miss.

27:33.146 --> 27:35.080
Does she sound familiar?

27:37.951 --> 27:40.685
- I know who she is.
- I get it now.

27:41.822 --> 27:44.772
Why Kate was so insistent
about meeting Charlie.

27:46.793 --> 27:48.881
She was pregnant.

27:49.329 --> 27:50.762
She told you?

27:50.864 --> 27:52.243
No.

27:52.357 --> 27:55.133
But when I read about
her murder, I-I realized

27:55.235 --> 27:57.902
she didn't want to give
birth to a new baby

27:57.971 --> 28:02.340
till she knew that the one she
gave up had everything he needed.

28:02.442 --> 28:03.808
I did.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.717
Mr. Warner.

28:14.454 --> 28:16.164
You know who I am?

28:16.473 --> 28:17.971
The husband.

28:21.027 --> 28:23.061
I saw you with my mother.

28:31.541 --> 28:34.506
You look a lot like her.

28:34.608 --> 28:36.141
What was she like?

28:42.282 --> 28:45.810
You said that, uh, you saw us together.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.237
When was that?

28:47.766 --> 28:49.899
Her letter came from an agency.

28:49.934 --> 28:53.435
They said she wanted to meet me,
and since I'm of age...

28:53.504 --> 28:55.124
It was my choice.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.974
- And did you want to?
- I had questions.

29:01.646 --> 29:04.346
"Why'd she give me up?"
"Did I have any siblings?"

29:04.415 --> 29:06.282
Things that...

29:06.384 --> 29:07.883
Everyone else takes for granted.

29:07.985 --> 29:10.019
You didn't do anything wrong, Charlie.

29:10.087 --> 29:12.350
- But I hurt you.
- No.

29:13.191 --> 29:16.525
I should have made it easier on
you instead of on myself.

29:16.627 --> 29:18.160
I was afraid.

29:20.932 --> 29:23.866
What if she didn't like me?

29:23.968 --> 29:26.302
I just wanted to look at her first.

29:55.333 --> 29:56.699
I followed you.

29:56.801 --> 30:00.536
And I saw the way you
were looking at Kate,
and I thought...

30:00.546 --> 30:02.538
Your mother found the letter
and then... and then lost it,

30:02.607 --> 30:06.342
and then she showed it to me after
she'd followed you, Charlie. I...

30:06.410 --> 30:07.876
I'm sorry, Mom.

30:07.945 --> 30:09.845
I-I just wanted to know
what she was like.

30:09.914 --> 30:12.615
Oh. And because of me,
now you never will.

30:12.625 --> 30:15.084
I am so sorry.

30:15.741 --> 30:17.052
Mr. Warner?

30:20.091 --> 30:22.291
Do you know who my father is?

30:33.471 --> 30:34.929
He is.

30:44.415 --> 30:45.981
I found Kate's lunch guest.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.384
Her name's Belinda Peterson.
She lives in south Carolina.

30:48.452 --> 30:50.185
You notify Charleston P.D.?

30:50.288 --> 30:52.888
- Told them you were on the way.
- Feel like taking a ride?

30:52.990 --> 30:54.556
Only if I can drive.

31:06.037 --> 31:07.528
What's up, Eric?

31:10.911 --> 31:12.675
A Reuben.

31:12.777 --> 31:14.276
With a side of crow.

31:17.048 --> 31:18.619
My favorite.

31:21.218 --> 31:22.707
Apology accepted.

31:23.587 --> 31:27.756
Seems all I do anymore is
apologize to everyone.

31:27.825 --> 31:28.957
Sorry.

31:33.130 --> 31:34.029
Mmm.

31:39.337 --> 31:41.136
You lost your wife and a baby.

31:41.238 --> 31:42.638
If feelings get hurt...

31:44.108 --> 31:46.008
I think your family
will give you a pass.

31:46.077 --> 31:49.211
That's just it...
You're not family anymore.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.813
I didn't say that to point fingers.

31:50.915 --> 31:51.914
Mnh-mnh.

31:51.982 --> 31:54.083
It's true. I'm not.

31:54.151 --> 31:56.085
Is that why you didn't
bring me any pickles?

31:58.622 --> 31:59.755
Next time.

31:59.857 --> 32:01.490
Right.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.060
Amanda said you're
throwing in the towel.

32:05.830 --> 32:07.429
She didn't give me a choice.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.166
We couldn't agree about kids.

32:15.239 --> 32:18.040
Kate had a son she gave up for adoption.

32:18.109 --> 32:19.308
I met him.

32:19.377 --> 32:21.159
She would have been so proud.

32:21.741 --> 32:23.946
His name's Charlie.

32:23.981 --> 32:28.117
He's not even mine,
but I still felt protective.

32:28.185 --> 32:30.886
He's looking for his biological father.

32:30.955 --> 32:33.689
He's, uh... He's not a good guy?

32:34.892 --> 32:37.393
Would have let him
down in the worst way.

32:37.428 --> 32:40.629
And his adoptive parents are stellar.

32:40.731 --> 32:42.131
Yeah.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.334
I wanted to adopt, too.

32:48.239 --> 32:50.657
What? I-I thought you didn't want kids.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.040
Of course I do.

32:53.552 --> 32:55.244
Look, I'm an only child, Eric.

32:55.312 --> 32:57.946
I wanted a house full
of them.

33:00.151 --> 33:02.044
But the, uh...

33:02.881 --> 33:07.256
The fertility issues
made that impossible.

33:21.739 --> 33:23.293
Let's just stop.

33:24.975 --> 33:26.775
We just have a couple more rounds,

33:26.844 --> 33:28.993
- and then we can take a break.
- No.

33:29.947 --> 33:33.081
I mean, stop, Amanda.

33:33.768 --> 33:35.250
Enough.

33:35.352 --> 33:38.333
- I want a family.
- So do I.

33:38.659 --> 33:42.090
All right? There are kids
out there who need a home...

33:42.193 --> 33:44.159
Loving parents.

33:44.261 --> 33:46.094
That is us, isn't it?

33:46.163 --> 33:48.096
I want my own baby.

33:50.668 --> 33:52.100
We can adopt.

33:53.513 --> 33:56.315
We can raise as many
babies as you can handle.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.485
Will you just consider it?

34:06.361 --> 34:08.127
Okay.

34:08.196 --> 34:11.610
If this next round doesn't work,
I'll think about it.

34:19.806 --> 34:21.250
Y...

34:42.163 --> 34:43.795
How long did you give it a try?

34:43.898 --> 34:44.996
Months.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.400
You know, sometimes Mandy
was in so much pain

34:47.502 --> 34:49.815
that she couldn't get out of bed.

34:50.203 --> 34:52.204
T-that's a hard way to live.

34:52.214 --> 34:54.873
You know, everything revolved

34:54.942 --> 34:57.910
around this one lousy day in a cycle.

34:59.213 --> 35:01.614
We became slaves to it.

35:01.716 --> 35:04.250
I begged her to quit.

35:04.894 --> 35:08.554
When she wouldn't, I walked away.

35:10.057 --> 35:12.557
I got to go. Thank you for the sandwich.

35:23.879 --> 35:26.550
Detective Cornell's
here to see you.

35:26.653 --> 35:28.452
Send her in.

35:29.582 --> 35:33.324
If you didn't kill your wife,
then I'm not your enemy.

35:33.393 --> 35:35.755
That's comforting.

35:35.765 --> 35:37.632
Our relationship became adversarial

35:37.701 --> 35:39.734
the moment you decided I was the killer.

35:39.803 --> 35:41.402
And I know I'm still on your short list,

35:41.438 --> 35:43.337
so please... don't lie.

35:43.347 --> 35:46.040
That's not entirely accurate.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.444
Now you're dissembling.

35:49.512 --> 35:50.951
It's okay for you to lie to me,

35:50.961 --> 35:54.282
but if I lie to you,
it's proof I killed my wife.

35:54.384 --> 35:57.144
Why would you lie to police, Mr. Warner?

35:57.311 --> 35:59.987
The real question is,
why does anyone talk to you at all?

36:00.090 --> 36:01.937
I speak for the dead.

36:01.947 --> 36:07.137
I'm the only one who speaks for Kate
now. Not your family, not you, but me.

36:08.998 --> 36:11.399
How's that working out for you?

36:12.076 --> 36:14.710
The best way to find out
who killed your wife

36:14.720 --> 36:16.789
is to talk to people who
had access to her...

36:16.799 --> 36:19.207
People like Belinda Peterson.

36:19.309 --> 36:20.803
Very nice lady.

36:20.813 --> 36:23.253
Imagine my surprise when
I went down to Charleston

36:23.263 --> 36:25.564
and found out you'd already been there.

36:26.733 --> 36:30.769
Listen, I had my suspicions
about the Petersons,

36:30.837 --> 36:32.671
but I'm satisfied.

36:32.739 --> 36:33.972
What about you?

36:34.007 --> 36:36.908
Oh, they wouldn't talk to
me without an attorney.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.144
Very thorough advice they got from you.

36:39.179 --> 36:42.247
Mm. But it makes sense.

36:42.316 --> 36:45.383
Innocent men have gone to prison
talking to you without one.

36:45.419 --> 36:47.886
You've cost me a lot
of time and effort...

36:47.955 --> 36:50.655
Time better spent finding
out who killed your wife.

36:50.757 --> 36:52.724
Or don't you care?

36:52.793 --> 36:55.160
- I care a great deal.
- Then help me.

36:55.228 --> 36:58.678
Stop interfering with my
investigation. Cooperate with me.

37:03.737 --> 37:06.437
I don't want to get in
your way, Detective.

37:07.574 --> 37:09.274
But as long as I have questions

37:09.343 --> 37:11.810
about what my wife did up
until the moment she died,

37:11.878 --> 37:14.245
I will continue looking into it.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.783
See, that's a problem for me.

37:20.187 --> 37:22.220
I'm sure you'll get over it.

37:27.527 --> 37:29.459
Be careful, Mr. Warner.

37:29.469 --> 37:33.519
The system hasn't changed all that
much since the last bid you served.

37:43.877 --> 37:47.278
- Did you find anything?
- Yes. And you're not gonna like it.

37:47.381 --> 37:49.347
The statement is from Tricoast Bank.

37:49.449 --> 37:51.416
We've never done business with them.

37:51.485 --> 37:53.752
- Who opened the account?
- Doesn't say.

37:53.820 --> 37:56.817
And they don't give out that
information over the phone.

37:56.827 --> 37:59.958
Well, whoever did it leveraged
a $12 million line of credit

38:00.027 --> 38:02.927
against the fund. Using
investor capital is fraud...

38:02.996 --> 38:04.896
Many, many counts of fraud.

38:04.998 --> 38:06.665
If Kate was onto them...

38:09.936 --> 38:12.237
The bastard may have
killed her to cover it up.

38:12.305 --> 38:15.306
I don't want to bring this up right now,
but I have something to tell you.

38:15.409 --> 38:16.274
What is it?

38:16.376 --> 38:17.642
A few days ago,

38:17.711 --> 38:19.844
Detective Cornell brought me
downtown and questioned me.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.680
I let slip something I shouldn't have.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.314
What'd you tell her?

38:23.383 --> 38:27.252
I overheard Kate having a heated
argument with Neil Oliver.

38:27.354 --> 38:30.722
She caught him having sex
with someone in his office.

38:34.494 --> 38:35.584
Who?

38:39.132 --> 38:40.532
May.

38:42.602 --> 38:45.036
I'm pretty sure it was Melanie.

38:57.892 --> 38:59.992
Okay, you were right to tell me.

39:02.222 --> 39:04.322
Listen, don't tell
anyone about Tricoast.

39:04.391 --> 39:08.460
I need to know exactly what this
means for S.E.G. Can you do that?

39:08.528 --> 39:09.661
Yes.

39:11.231 --> 39:12.897
Thanks.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.243
You wanted to see me?

39:25.312 --> 39:28.179
Three forensic reports,
72 witness statements,

39:28.281 --> 39:30.381
and hundreds of man-hours.

39:30.484 --> 39:31.983
Why are you telling me this?

39:32.085 --> 39:34.519
As of this moment,
Ivan Dale's case is unsolved,

39:34.554 --> 39:36.287
but it's not for lack of trying.

39:36.356 --> 39:38.256
Give them a gold star.

39:38.358 --> 39:40.191
It was a drug house, Andrea.

39:40.227 --> 39:43.277
There was no way to know and
nothing you could do.

39:43.864 --> 39:47.298
- If we didn't split up...
- You could be dead, too.

39:48.235 --> 39:50.882
Look, I just thought you
should hear it from me

39:50.892 --> 39:52.604
that no one is giving up.

39:52.706 --> 39:54.005
Okay?

40:01.882 --> 40:03.782
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Mr. Warner.

40:03.850 --> 40:07.385
I hope the terms we offered on
the account are satisfactory.

40:07.521 --> 40:09.187
Your terms are impressive.

40:09.289 --> 40:10.922
We like to think so.

40:10.932 --> 40:14.325
Have a seat, please.

40:14.335 --> 40:16.761
So, how can I be of service?

40:16.830 --> 40:19.130
I need a copy of the original paperwork.

40:19.232 --> 40:21.633
Not a problem.

40:22.269 --> 40:24.956
And a record of all
account activity, please.

40:27.774 --> 40:31.323
May I ask why? You get a
statement every month.

40:32.212 --> 40:34.412
Sir, is there a problem?

40:38.652 --> 40:42.353
My wife was an officer in the
company and recently died.

40:43.757 --> 40:47.458
I'm... terribly sorry.

40:47.561 --> 40:49.694
Thank you.

40:51.431 --> 40:53.464
I figured the best way to
get a handle on things

40:53.567 --> 40:55.700
is to come straight to the source.

40:55.950 --> 40:58.002
Well, I'm glad you did.

40:59.139 --> 41:01.239
Here's, uh...

41:01.341 --> 41:05.857
Here's the opening paperwork. I'll have
someone else pull the rest for you.

41:19.071 --> 41:23.432
