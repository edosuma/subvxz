WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:03.891
-The FBI knows about
Emmett and Leanne.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.015
-Are you sure?

00:05.020 --> 00:05.714
-Yeah.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.224
And Stan Beeman paid
their son a visit.

00:09.230 --> 00:10.413
-I'm not stupid.

00:10.420 --> 00:11.409
-I know you're not.

00:11.410 --> 00:15.312
-But I want to know what's going on.
-There's a protest at an Air Force

00:15.320 --> 00:17.106
Base in Pennsylvania
this weekend.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.465
A group from church is going.

00:19.470 --> 00:20.835
I want to go, too.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.617
-It's not you that I
want, it's the scumbags

00:24.620 --> 00:26.349
who killed my friends.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.248
-Where are they?

00:46.760 --> 00:48.318
-What will happen to me, Stan?

00:48.320 --> 00:52.256
-Well, we'll find a way
out for you and for me.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.626
-I can't go back.

00:54.630 --> 00:55.608
-What does it say?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.309
-Get Jared out.

01:08.450 --> 01:09.644
-Kate's dead.

01:09.650 --> 01:10.480
-Probably.

01:10.490 --> 01:11.673
I'm going down there.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.908
I'm going to get Jared.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.287
-Whoever killed Emmett and
Leanne probably killed Kate.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.909
-We need to have
The Centre make sure

01:20.910 --> 01:23.515
that Larrick is
still in Nicaragua.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.817
-I'll go signal.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.094
-Wait.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.853
Just until_we know
what's gomg on, I--

01:28.860 --> 01:29.554
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.288
You're right.

01:30.290 --> 01:30.984
I'll stay.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.208
The kids shouldn't be
in the house alone.

01:33.210 --> 01:34.302
-Signal from here.

01:34.310 --> 01:35.436
-I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.874
-What are the odds the FBI is
signal chasing in Falls Church

01:37.880 --> 01:39.381
right now?

01:39.390 --> 01:40.084
-OK, go.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.432
I'll do it when the
kids are in bed.

01:54.090 --> 01:55.694
-There was an emergency at work.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.258
I'm going to head
into the office.

01:57.270 --> 02:00.421
-Did a plane full of
your clients crash?

02:00.430 --> 02:02.728
-That's not funny.

02:02.730 --> 02:06.166
-Sorry, I-- tell me what
exactly happened at work.

02:06.170 --> 02:08.263
-What is the matter
with you, Paige?

02:08.270 --> 02:10.158
We had an important client
flying to Phoenix with his

02:10.160 --> 02:12.344
whole _sales team and the
reservations were cancelled.

02:12.350 --> 02:13.669
The hotel was overbooked.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.705
So now we have find
them other rooms.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.735
-And you can't do that
from a phone here?

02:17.740 --> 02:20.174
-All of our contacts
are at the office.

02:20.180 --> 02:23.399
After your homework, don't
forget to do the dishes.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.264
-I thought you were going
to help me pack for my trip.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.806
-Can we, um, can we
do that tomorrow?

02:30.810 --> 02:33.449
-I-- I have to leave straight
from school tomorrow.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.236
I need to pack tonight.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.172
-Paige, I'm so sorry.

02:36.180 --> 02:39.934
I really-- I-- I wanted to help
you, but I just-- the business,

02:39.940 --> 02:41.146
I really can't tonight.

02:44.140 --> 02:44.925
Yeah.

02:44.930 --> 02:45.624
Fine.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.928
-I, uh, thought you were asleep.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.454
-I thought you were asleep.

05:07.460 --> 05:08.154
-No.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.229
I was just doing some housework.

05:11.850 --> 05:14.080
-mom's not back?

05:14.090 --> 05:15.569
-No, still at work.

05:15.580 --> 05:19.698
You know, it's two hours
earlier in Arizona on this.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.763
It's a lot of work,
this hotel stuff.

05:24.770 --> 05:25.668
-Right.

05:28.040 --> 05:28.734
-Hello?

05:28.740 --> 05:29.604
Hey.

05:29.610 --> 05:30.304
-Hey, honey.

05:30.310 --> 05:31.595
Everything OK there?

05:31.600 --> 05:34.580
-House, neighbourhood--
everything quiet.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.478
You?

05:36.480 --> 05:38.209
-I, uh, I asked
about our friend.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.461
No one knows where
she IS rIght now.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.609
Also, we're not the
only ones having trouble

05:42.620 --> 05:44.326
contacting her
answering service.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.729
They do want the boy to--

05:47.060 --> 05:47.754
-Paige?

05:51.480 --> 05:52.174
Paige?

05:55.470 --> 05:58.030
Paige, hang up the phone and
let me and mom talk, please.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.598
And if we catch you
listening in again,

05:59.610 --> 06:01.578
we will take that
phone out of your room.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.748
The young man, uh,
we were talking

06:22.750 --> 06:23.614
about-- our client agrees.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.009
We should get him a
ticket out ASAP also.

06:26.010 --> 06:31.971
He knows why his parents
travelled so much.

06:31.980 --> 06:32.947
-What?

06:32.950 --> 06:36.363
-Yeah, I know.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.406
-Why-- why would
they tell him that?

06:38.410 --> 06:39.104
-That's all I got.

06:39.110 --> 06:41.340
It was a short back
and forth, obviously.

06:41.350 --> 06:42.157
Liz, listen.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.684
Do you remember what we
used a couple of years

06:43.690 --> 06:45.339
back to let that guy,
Andy, know we were friends?

06:45.350 --> 06:46.214
Yes.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.973
-They said it would
work with the boy, too.

06:48.980 --> 06:49.674
-OK.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.188
No one's seen Kate.

06:54.190 --> 06:54.952
No.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.554
George either.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.539
-Damn it.

06:59.550 --> 07:03.020
-Get home soon.

07:03.030 --> 07:03.724
-I will.

07:28.030 --> 07:32.399
-We'll take you to a big
city, no Soviet consulate,

07:32.400 --> 07:34.527
where you can blend in.

07:34.530 --> 07:36.009
I'll visit every weekend I can.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.869
-What about you?

07:44.020 --> 07:47.729
Oleg will find a way to let
the FBI know about what you

07:47.730 --> 07:51.632
did with the
surveillance reports.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.312
You said you can go to gaol.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.959
-He can't prove it.

07:55.970 --> 07:58.962
There could be a mole
in the FBI People leave

07:58.970 --> 08:03.236
that crap on top of the
mail robot all the time.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.927
It would seem like 100 other
provocations the KGB has made.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.010
I'll be fine.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.537
I'm going to get you
a car and some money.

08:17.540 --> 08:21.317
You can leave tomorrow.

08:21.320 --> 08:27.281
-And what, I'll just
drive where you tell me?

08:27.290 --> 08:30.544
-You know what to do.

08:30.550 --> 08:34.190
You know how to
disappear if you have to.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.100
I will visit you whenever I can.

08:43.580 --> 08:44.319
-For how long?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.400
-As long as we need.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.413
Eventually we'll figure out
something that will be better.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.224
-Hi, Jared.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.039
-Hi.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.396
-I think the three things a
person should focus on everyday

09:43.400 --> 09:46.187
are health, growth,
and community.

09:46.190 --> 09:47.111
Don't you?

09:50.140 --> 09:51.619
Please get in the
car for a minute.

09:51.630 --> 09:52.380
I want to talk to you.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.529
I know this is surprising,
I know it's hard,

10:13.540 --> 10:14.768
but I have something
I need to talk--

10:14.770 --> 10:17.785
-So you're not a social worker.

10:17.790 --> 10:20.179
-No.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.296
I knew your parents very well.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.292
I came before to
check on you because I

10:25.300 --> 10:26.961
knew they'd want me to.

10:26.970 --> 10:29.029
-You knew my parents?

10:29.040 --> 10:31.133
-Yeah.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.563
I worked with them sometimes.

10:33.570 --> 10:35.538
We had the same job.

10:35.540 --> 10:36.529
You know about that, right?

10:40.100 --> 10:43.979
We have to take a drive, talk
about some important things.

10:43.980 --> 10:44.674
OK?

11:07.440 --> 11:09.226
-It's coming out
in June, but I just

11:09.230 --> 11:10.731
can't imagine it being any good.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.628
I mean the first was terrible.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.110
It was nothing like
the TV show at all.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.988
Although Khan was on the show,
so maybe it will be better,

11:18.990 --> 11:20.924
but I don't know.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.216
I just don't have
high expectations.

11:23.220 --> 11:26.986
Well, another day
another no dollar.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.309
-So be careful at the protest.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.742
Don't get arrested.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.298
-I guess I'm not
going to see mom.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.973
-She said to tell you
to have a good trip.

11:34.980 --> 11:36.538
-Did everyone get a room?

11:36.540 --> 11:38.064
-Yeah.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.685
-See you Sunday night.

11:39.690 --> 11:41.089
-OK, bye.

11:41.090 --> 11:42.489
-If she gets
arrested are we going

11:42.500 --> 11:44.286
to go to Pennsylvania
to bail her out?

11:44.290 --> 11:45.552
-She's not going
to get arrested.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.254
-Yes, she is.

11:46.260 --> 11:48.865
And you're late, so go.

11:48.870 --> 11:49.564
Bye.

11:49.570 --> 11:50.264
-Bye.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.414
-You met with a_wo_man
from our organisation.

11:59.070 --> 12:02.096
She taught you that signal,
that if someone set it

12:02.100 --> 12:05.297
that meant you could trust them.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.178
-Where is she?

12:08.180 --> 12:10.876
-I don't know where
she is right now.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.745
The reason I'm here-- and
I'm going to be completely

12:12.750 --> 12:18.279
honest with you, Jared--
there are some problems

12:18.290 --> 12:20.622
and you might be in some danger.

12:20.630 --> 12:22.905
With what happened
to your family,

12:22.910 --> 12:25.879
you can understand we
want to be very careful.

12:25.890 --> 12:29.314
We want to take the best
pOSS|b|e care of you rIght now.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.878
-What problems?

12:30.890 --> 12:32.437
And how do you not
know where she is?

12:35.670 --> 12:37.809
-There are people out
there who will always

12:37.810 --> 12:40.347
want to hurt us in
this work that we do.

12:40.350 --> 12:45.242
We'r_e_concerned_ there's a
specanc danger right now.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.013
-To me?

12:47.020 --> 12:47.714
-Yeah.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.568
Jared, I made a
promise to your mother

12:52.570 --> 12:55.118
to look out for you and
I'm going to do that.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.647
I'm going to get
you somewhere safe.

12:58.650 --> 12:59.344
-OK.

13:03.740 --> 13:07.540
-I said I'd be honest
with you and I will be.

13:07.550 --> 13:11.429
So there's something hard
you have to understand.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.715
You're not going to be able
to go back to your old life.

13:19.740 --> 13:22.777
-What do you mean?

13:22.780 --> 13:23.656
Ever?

13:23.660 --> 13:25.013
-I know it sounds
awful right now,

13:25.020 --> 13:28.444
but the whole idea_will
get easrer In a while,

13:28.450 --> 13:29.348
I promise you.

13:35.730 --> 13:40.281
Knowing your mom and dad, who
they were, the kind of people

13:40.290 --> 13:45.159
they were, I know
you have the strength

13:45.170 --> 13:46.159
inside to get through this.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.316
-I am so sorry I didn't make
it back here last night,

14:04.320 --> 14:06.811
but I brought you
your favourite danish.

14:06.820 --> 14:07.661
-Mm, good.

14:34.630 --> 14:36.769
-Where did you get these?

14:36.780 --> 14:38.532
-People just leave
them on top of the mail

14:38.540 --> 14:42.738
robot-- completely unsecured.

14:42.740 --> 14:46.255
I've made several complaints
and no one listens.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.649
So I think your office
should know about it.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.253
-You just took them?

14:54.260 --> 14:55.397
-I did.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.472
You want proof Agent Gaad isn't
running a secure facility,

14:58.480 --> 14:59.845
you have it.

14:59.850 --> 15:04.469
-Uh, Martha, this is
incredibly helpful,

15:04.480 --> 15:06.789
but you have to be careful.

15:06.790 --> 15:09.247
Classified documents
are carefully tracked.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.502
-That's not the point.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.468
You think security is bad
there, you have no idea.

15:14.470 --> 15:15.903
They're ordered
up from archives,

15:15.910 --> 15:18.287
read, and left on top of
that robot for half the day

15:18.290 --> 15:20.099
while it goes around the Bureau.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.249
Anyone could take them.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.728
And when they're
sent back, the clerks

15:24.730 --> 15:27.392
don't want to be bothered if
It's after hours, so people

15:27.400 --> 15:30.756
leave them on the floor outside
the door to the file room

15:30.760 --> 15:32.182
overnight.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.862
-OK.

15:33.870 --> 15:36.373
I-- I just want to be
sure you're being careful.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.835
-C|ark, I love the
way you love me.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.523
You don't have to
hide anything from me.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.093
I even love your toupee.

15:57.830 --> 15:59.206
-You know about that?

16:03.130 --> 16:06.338
-I can be a little bit late
for work today, can you?

16:10.040 --> 16:11.450
-How long have you known?

16:34.140 --> 16:35.846
How _
are you today, Sir?

16:35.850 --> 16:36.965
Good.

16:36.970 --> 16:39.780
-Are you looking for
something specific?

16:39.790 --> 16:42.611
-Just something reliable that
won't crap out as soon as I

16:42.620 --> 16:44.451
drive if off the lot.

16:44.460 --> 16:45.154
For my niece.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.125
-No, thanks.

16:51.130 --> 16:51.824
-Filthy habit.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.229
Always the hardest to kick.

16:53.240 --> 16:59.531
I got a niece special right
over here-- one owner.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.896
-Little old lady
drove it to church.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.528
-To Atlantic City, actually--
back and forth a lot.

17:05.530 --> 17:09.409
She had a gambling
problem-- another bad habit.

17:09.410 --> 17:11.617
Had to sell it for beans.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.416
It's clean as a whistle.

17:12.420 --> 17:16.698
Got a lot of miles on it,
but, uh, it's a good deal.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.988
-Well, $3,400's a little
out of my price range.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.038
-What were you thinking?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.871
-More like the Maverick.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.199
-The Maverick's a piece of shit.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.633
I sell it to you, I
gotta go to confession.

17:32.490 --> 17:36.153
-How about we meet
in the middle?

17:36.160 --> 17:38.549
-I've got a lot of vehicles in
your price range-- functional

17:38.560 --> 17:41.893
vehicles-- but _if
you want your nIece

17:41.900 --> 17:45.301
to have a safe, comfortable
ride, a ride that demonstrates

17:45.310 --> 17:48.188
how much she means to you,
this will do the trick.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.216
-And what if I pay cash?

17:52.220 --> 17:54.666
-We accept cash.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.535
I'd buy it myself if I had
someone who meant a lot to me

17:56.540 --> 18:00.044
because that's what this car
says-- you mean a lot to me.

18:00.050 --> 18:03.269
But I am sorry ass
son of a bitch.

18:03.270 --> 18:04.953
I don't have a niece.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.858
I don't even have a cousin.

18:09.030 --> 18:11.089
-I_ can't fill _out the
registration right now.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.864
I'm a bit a hurry.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.030
-Not a problem on my end.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.018
-OK.

18:21.030 --> 18:21.724
OK.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.235
-There's a restroom over there.

18:36.240 --> 18:42.372
You need to go in, you need
to change into these clothes.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.779
-Why?

18:43.780 --> 18:45.179
-It's something that we do.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.999
We clean ourselves.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.377
You don't get to take
anything with you.

18:49.380 --> 18:50.802
When you're done, put
everything, including

18:50.810 --> 18:54.473
your shoes, into your backpack
and bring them back to me.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.174
-OK.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.196
-Could you?

19:40.200 --> 19:40.894
Thanks.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.795
-Well, I'm glad you came by.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.553
-Me, too.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.458
-Clark?

20:08.470 --> 20:10.426
-Mm-hm.

20:10.430 --> 20:14.730
-It's so nice just
the two of us.

20:14.740 --> 20:18.289
But, well, when do
you think it would

20:18.290 --> 20:23.762
be good to start thinking
about the three or four of us?

20:30.420 --> 20:35.244
-Martha, that's not for me, and
I thought you understood that.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.165
-What you mean?

20:44.010 --> 20:48.344
-My life, my career-- I'm--
I'm not around all the time.

20:48.350 --> 20:50.466
You can't raise kids like that.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.324
-I know, but this
arrangement isn't forever.

20:52.330 --> 20:53.319
At some point--

20:53.330 --> 20:54.149
-I'm sorry, Martha.

20:54.160 --> 20:58.574
It's-- children aren't
in the cards for me.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.612
-So where-- where
are they taking me?

21:24.620 --> 21:25.769
-It's not settled yet.

21:25.770 --> 21:27.158
I'll come in a
few days, I'll let

21:27.160 --> 21:29.196
you know, and help
with everything.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.701
-But will it be in this country?

21:33.540 --> 21:34.234
-No.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.522
-Let's just get you where
you need to go today.

21:39.530 --> 21:41.259
Do you remember where
you get off the train?

21:41.270 --> 21:41.964
-Yeah.

21:46.660 --> 21:51.085
-I put in some water and
some sandwiches for you.

21:51.090 --> 21:52.785
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

21:52.790 --> 21:56.021
You should probably go.

21:56.030 --> 21:57.418
Wait.

21:57.420 --> 22:00.423
This is the phone number you
should call when you get there.

22:00.430 --> 22:01.818
You can't lose this.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.051
-No, I won't.

22:05.060 --> 22:05.901
-I'll see you soon.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.083
-Nina, I've got
everything ready.

24:19.090 --> 24:19.784
1--

24:24.190 --> 24:25.862
-Do you know who I am?

24:25.870 --> 24:27.997
-What the hell is going on here?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.470
-Your lover has committed
treason against us

24:31.480 --> 24:34.460
and you have committed
treason against your country.

24:34.470 --> 24:35.653
-That's a lie.

24:35.660 --> 24:38.072
-Tell him, Nina Sergeevna.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.479
-They will take
me back for trial,

24:39.480 --> 24:44.270
Stan, for what we did together.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.212
And they will execute me.

24:48.830 --> 24:50.400
-Let's not debate
about the rest.

24:50.410 --> 24:54.858
Let's talk about
where to go from here.

24:54.870 --> 24:58.863
There are alternatives
that are better for me

24:58.870 --> 25:02.385
than to send this document to
your superiors and her back

25:02.390 --> 25:06.429
to Moscow for trial
and execution.

25:06.430 --> 25:10.366
You could go off
together, free and happy.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.292
Does this interest
you, Agent Beeman?

25:15.560 --> 25:18.814
It's a simple transaction.

25:18.820 --> 25:23.507
You have access to a computer
program called Echo.

25:23.510 --> 25:25.489
It's part of Stealth.

25:25.490 --> 25:30.029
When you deliver the Echo
program to me I will let Nina

25:30.030 --> 25:33.602
Sergeevna go free
and you two love

25:33.610 --> 25:37.683
birds can fly off together.

26:05.780 --> 26:06.678
-Hey.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.318
I'm glad your
parents let you come.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.082
-Yeah.

26:09.090 --> 26:11.513
I was surprised, but yeah.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.169
-Well, what changed their minds?

26:13.170 --> 26:16.537
-I think they were afraid of
what I'd do if they said no.

26:16.540 --> 26:18.030
-What were you going to do?

26:18.040 --> 26:20.099
-Something.

26:20.100 --> 26:20.794
Nothing.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.701
I don't know.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.907
-They knew it was
important to you.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.378
-I guess.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.530
-Is your dad hard on you?

26:31.540 --> 26:34.077
-Um, I don't know.

26:34.080 --> 26:37.015
It's-- it's usually more my mom.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.181
I mean I love them, I do.

26:39.190 --> 26:42.136
But it's like I don't
even know who they are,

26:42.140 --> 26:45.701
and sometimes I think
he's having an affair

26:45.710 --> 26:49.362
or she's having an
affair-- or both.

26:49.370 --> 26:51.201
All I know is I
don't believe a word

26:51.210 --> 26:54.122
that comes out of their mouths.

26:54.130 --> 26:59.739
-Being a parent's hard,
but so is having parents.

27:15.570 --> 27:16.343
-Where's Henry?

27:16.350 --> 27:17.044
-Peter's house.

27:17.050 --> 27:17.971
Went straight from school.

27:17.980 --> 27:19.561
Paige should be in
Pennsylvania by now.

27:19.570 --> 27:20.264
-And everyone--

27:20.270 --> 27:21.271
-Everyone else is clean.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.566
There's not a trace of
surveillance on any of us.

27:27.350 --> 27:31.719
-And any word from The
Centre about Kate or George?

27:31.730 --> 27:35.325
-They want us to move
on something-- now.

27:35.330 --> 27:38.663
Paint samples they use
on the Stealth aircraft.

27:38.670 --> 27:39.637
-Great.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.438
-I know.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.134
How was he?

27:47.060 --> 27:50.006
-He went, didn't fall apart.

27:50.010 --> 27:50.988
-Tough kid.

27:50.990 --> 27:53.094
-Like his parents.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.534
That's what I told him.

27:55.540 --> 27:59.988
The only thing-- why was Kate
meeting him out of disguise?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.514
And why would The Centre
tell him about his parents?

28:02.520 --> 28:04.249
They don't have to do
that to give him money

28:04.250 --> 28:05.717
or to make sure he's OK.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.347
-I'm sure they know
what they're doing.

28:07.350 --> 28:08.612
-They should keep us informed.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.305
-Well, they don't think
it's any of our business.

28:11.310 --> 28:13.540
If something else were
going on, if they thought

28:13.550 --> 28:16.064
we were at risk, they'd tell us.

28:16.070 --> 28:16.764
-I know.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.659
All right, are you going back
to Fred on the Stealth paint?

28:22.660 --> 28:26.312
-Yeah, he's our way in and
we need to move fast, but--

28:26.320 --> 28:27.389
-But what?

28:27.390 --> 28:29.062
I- I haven't turned him over.

28:29.070 --> 28:31.049
He's still Emmett's agent.

28:31.050 --> 28:32.620
-What is he like?

28:32.630 --> 28:35.940
-A loner, grandiose--
tells himself

28:35.950 --> 28:37.315
he was doing it for
the cause, but Emmett

28:37.320 --> 28:39.902
could have had him working
for spacemen from Mars

28:39.910 --> 28:43.004
if it made him feel like he
was better than everyone else.

28:43.010 --> 28:45.183
No friends, from girlfriend.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.589
Gutsy, smart, reliable.

28:46.590 --> 28:49.172
I kind of like him.

28:49.180 --> 28:50.738
-How did Emmett
get through to him?

28:50.740 --> 28:54.767
-Family-- he talked to
him about his family.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.795
Guy had a closet full
of gifts for Jared.

29:08.230 --> 29:09.447
-Excuse me, ma'am.

29:09.450 --> 29:13.386
I'm Detective Korrigan,
Petersburg County.

29:13.390 --> 29:17.690
We are looking for a
runaway boy, 16 years old,

29:17.700 --> 29:20.726
slight build, dark hair,
might be travelling

29:20.730 --> 29:23.210
with a female mid- to late '30s.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.836
We have reason to believe he
departed from this station

29:25.840 --> 29:30.311
with or without the woman
in the last hour or so.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.787
-There was a boy
with brown hair.

29:31.790 --> 29:35.681
He took the train alone
about an hour ago.

29:35.690 --> 29:36.486
-Where was he going?

29:36.490 --> 29:37.388
-Upstate New York.

29:37.390 --> 29:39.153
Let me look up the
station for you.

30:05.780 --> 30:06.644
-Nice to meet you.

30:06.650 --> 30:07.344
-You, too.

30:07.350 --> 30:10.706
I've heard a lot about you.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.416
-All those years I
never met Emmett's wife.

30:12.420 --> 30:15.207
-Well, we're really
not supposed to, but--

30:15.210 --> 30:17.223
-You can't always
follow the rules.

30:17.230 --> 30:18.834
-Yeah.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.193
How have you been?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.919
-Everyone back home was
worried because we're

30:22.930 --> 30:26.502
behind in a lot
of important ways.

30:26.510 --> 30:28.523
I talked with Skeevers.

30:28.530 --> 30:30.748
He told me about a
faction called 237.

30:30.750 --> 30:31.455
You know it?

30:31.460 --> 30:33.337
-I've heard of it.

30:33.340 --> 30:36.628
-Is there any way you could
get in there for some kind

30:36.630 --> 30:39.884
of budget review,
something like that?

30:39.890 --> 30:41.266
-I think I can.

30:41.270 --> 30:46.458
-They make a radar absorbent
paint and we need a sample,

30:46.460 --> 30:50.419
but you would have to
get on the shop floor.

30:50.420 --> 30:52.786
-Uh, that's not the
most natural place

30:52.790 --> 30:54.109
to go when you're
doing a budget review.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.519
It's a restricted area.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.761
-You would just do
45 seconds walking

30:57.770 --> 30:58.998
across the floor, that's it.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.558
-We have_ shoes
With speCIal soles

31:00.560 --> 31:03.609
that would pick up
traces of what we need.

31:03.610 --> 31:04.929
-There's a lot security.

31:04.930 --> 31:09.754
-Fred, I-- I-- I can't tell
you how important this is.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.979
Of all the things going on right
now, this is it-- the thing

31:12.980 --> 31:13.981
that will make the difference.

31:22.310 --> 31:23.459
-I'll make some calls.

31:23.470 --> 31:26.064
I'll let you know when I
can get into the factory.

31:26.070 --> 31:29.289
As for the floor,
once I'm there,

31:29.290 --> 31:33.715
I might be able to
wander off, say I'm lost.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.914
Budget guys are
always getting lost.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.627
-Yes, Emmett and Leanne
Connors, the couple

31:41.630 --> 31:43.211
that was murdered
with their daughter.

31:43.220 --> 31:44.346
We're talking to
anyone who worked

31:44.350 --> 31:47.148
with them in any capacity.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.038
Right.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.247
And before the field agent
comes out to interview you,

31:52.250 --> 31:54.536
it would be helpful if you could
make a list of anyone else you

31:54.540 --> 31:57.850
knew who did business
with Mr. Connors.

31:57.860 --> 31:59.669
Great.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.910
Well, we'll be in touch then.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.614
Thank you.

32:17.150 --> 32:18.128
Sir?

32:18.130 --> 32:20.576
-That's all.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.070
-Uh, I've been
looking into Stealth.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.265
I discovered a computer
program they use called Echo.

32:25.270 --> 32:27.158
I think it's a real
weak spot, something

32:27.160 --> 32:29.640
the Soviets might
try to go after.

32:29.650 --> 32:30.742
So I'm going to
look into it, see

32:30.750 --> 32:32.240
ifI can shore up
their security.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.889
-Great.

32:34.890 --> 32:35.822
-Echo, it's called.

32:35.830 --> 32:38.617
I don't really understand
it-- computer stuff.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.405
-Who does?

33:10.190 --> 33:11.418
-Come on.

33:11.420 --> 33:12.614
I have dinner for you.

35:37.530 --> 35:42.229
-We've developed information
suggesting active KGB threats

35:42.230 --> 35:44.664
against something called Echo.

35:44.670 --> 35:45.568
Do you know what that is?

35:45.570 --> 35:46.878
-Of course.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.587
-I understand it's some
sort of computer program,

35:49.590 --> 35:52.593
but that's all I know-- that
and the fact that the KGB

35:52.600 --> 35:54.101
wants to get their hands on it.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.408
-They wouldn't know
what to do with it.

35:56.410 --> 35:59.231
-I'll need to do a
full security reVIew.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.447
I'll need files on everyone
who has access to the program

36:01.450 --> 36:04.010
and locations and
security procedures

36:04.020 --> 36:05.282
of every place that runs it.

36:05.290 --> 36:07.269
-There's only one place.

36:07.270 --> 36:08.669
I can get you in to
check it out tomorrow.

38:16.810 --> 38:18.539
-Hey.

38:18.540 --> 38:19.234
-Oh, hey.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.229
Did you want something?

38:20.240 --> 38:20.934
-Oh, no thanks.

38:20.940 --> 38:21.634
I'm not hungry.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.414
-OK.

38:23.420 --> 38:29.598
-Hey, I stole something
for you-- "Roclq Horror."

38:29.600 --> 38:33.206
I've got a whole evidence
locker full of that stuff now.

38:33.210 --> 38:33.904
-Thanks.

38:33.910 --> 38:36.936
-I thought you could have
some friends over to watch it.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.249
-I'm going to meet up with Kyle.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.047
-Oh, I-- I'll give you a lift.

38:41.050 --> 38:41.744
-Uh,no.

38:41.750 --> 38:42.444
It's fine.

38:42.450 --> 38:43.724
I'm going to walk.

38:43.730 --> 38:44.424
I'm going.

38:44.430 --> 38:45.897
-Hey, see you later.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.037
-Bye.

38:47.040 --> 38:47.734
-Have fun.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.198
Do you want me to move out?

39:21.910 --> 39:24.140
-Uh,no.

39:24.150 --> 39:25.640
I'm going to move in with him.

39:49.030 --> 39:49.792
-Is he a good guy?

39:55.940 --> 39:59.831
-He's able to be in
the flow of things.

40:05.420 --> 40:07.399
Yeah, he's a good guy.

40:46.510 --> 40:47.750
-He's at the cabin.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.649
They're getting the
passwords and papers now.

40:50.660 --> 40:52.742
The_ exfiltration
team is on the way.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.184
-Good.

40:55.190 --> 40:56.168
-Did Paige call?

40:56.170 --> 40:57.649
-I spoke to the
secretary at the church.

40:57.650 --> 40:58.571
They're up there.
They're fine.

41:06.120 --> 41:06.814
What?

41:06.820 --> 41:07.627
What is it?

41:11.020 --> 41:15.502
-Where the hell are we sending
him, Switzerland, Hungary?

41:15.510 --> 41:17.592
-They might want
to keep him close.

41:17.600 --> 41:23.368
Or Australia, somewhere he
can just get along in English.

41:23.370 --> 41:26.203
-Mm.

41:26.210 --> 41:28.781
So, that kid to group
in Virginia Beach,

41:28.790 --> 41:30.087
we'll just drop him
off somewhere-- one

41:30.090 --> 41:31.398
of those places.

41:31.400 --> 41:35.348
Doesn't know anyone.

41:35.350 --> 41:36.044
-Sounds like us.

41:36.050 --> 41:37.460
-We had each other.

41:37.470 --> 41:39.734
We were older, our parents
hadn't just been killed.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.356
-I just mean he has no choice.

41:42.360 --> 41:43.531
But he'll figure it out.

41:46.140 --> 41:48.563
He'll make it.

41:48.570 --> 41:50.686
-If Paige and Henry were in
his shoes, they wouldn't.

41:50.690 --> 41:52.339
They'd be dead in
an alley in a week.

41:52.340 --> 41:56.379
-Paige is smarter than anyone.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.540
She can talk people
in circles, she

41:57.550 --> 41:58.960
can think people in circles.

41:58.970 --> 42:00.938
And Henry-- yeah, he's
a kid, but in a couple

42:00.940 --> 42:01.895
of years, who knows.

42:05.140 --> 42:09.110
-One day it's coming--
you know it is.

42:09.120 --> 42:13.068
-Take it easy
because nobody knows

42:13.070 --> 42:16.665
anything, so just--
just take it easy.

42:23.980 --> 42:26.050
-We think he might have
come in on the last train.

42:26.060 --> 42:26.754
-Yeah, yeah.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.136
I saw him.

42:28.140 --> 42:28.834
-Great.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.398
Did somebody pick him up?

42:30.410 --> 42:33.208
-Yeah, a lady in a truck.

42:33.220 --> 42:34.096
-What kind of truck?
