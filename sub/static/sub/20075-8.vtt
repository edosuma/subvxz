WEBVTT

00:03.102 --> 00:04.744
Put your principle into good use.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.103
Do you think you could help me get
to the bottom of the drugs supply.

00:07.109 --> 00:10.021
- There is a fucking officer involved.
- There's no officer.

00:10.027 --> 00:13.104
Behold... the Green Wall!

00:13.110 --> 00:15.751
- We're goin' into business.
- What, you guys go the green light?

00:15.757 --> 00:18.149
We've got, uh, a proposition
to make to you Liz.

00:18.155 --> 00:22.162
We want you to come on board
as our horticultural expert.

00:22.168 --> 00:23.674
Hey, Miss Westfall...

00:26.764 --> 00:27.968
You know you promised me.

00:27.974 --> 00:31.074
You looked me in the eye, you said
"I'm not gonna try anything anymore."

00:31.080 --> 00:33.103
- I won't do it again.
- Get out.

00:33.109 --> 00:34.552
Do you wanna touch me?

00:34.558 --> 00:35.758
Do you?

00:35.834 --> 00:38.255
- Ugh!
- Argh!

00:38.261 --> 00:41.131
There's no easy way out for you.

00:42.045 --> 00:44.750
Now, I'm gonna get out and
you're gonna come with me.

00:44.756 --> 00:46.555
- What?
- Now, you need to get out

00:46.561 --> 00:48.163
and you need to live a happy life.

00:48.169 --> 00:50.528
That's the revenge you get on Ferguson.

00:50.534 --> 00:51.734
You're on.

01:50.056 --> 01:51.956
Yeah, thanks for sayin' somethin'.

01:51.962 --> 01:54.389
That's all right, they
were just worried about ya.

01:54.454 --> 01:57.187
Just forget Ferguson, we
just gotta get outta here.

01:57.626 --> 01:59.570
Won't grow old in this fuckin' dump.

02:00.437 --> 02:03.938
- Hey, Marge!
- Red's wall's lookin' good.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.343
Want some help with your flowers?

02:08.640 --> 02:10.009
Marge?!

02:10.428 --> 02:11.815
You okay, mate?

02:12.323 --> 02:13.523
Eh?

02:13.529 --> 02:15.012
- Oh, shit!
- Oi!

02:15.018 --> 02:16.411
Marge?

02:19.121 --> 02:22.670
No... no, so she's like,
just like sittin' there, like,

02:22.676 --> 02:25.286
- like stiff, like a zombie. You know?
- I know.

02:25.292 --> 02:27.881
- Poor old thing.
- Plenty of worse ways to go.

02:27.887 --> 02:29.143
Here she comes.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.440
See ya, Marge.

02:30.446 --> 02:32.669
- See ya, Marge.
- Won't be the same without ya, Marge.

02:32.675 --> 02:33.937
- Miss ya, Marge.
- See ya, Marge.

02:33.943 --> 02:36.393
- On ya, Marge. God bless.
- Hey, Mr J...

02:36.399 --> 02:39.398
- what happened?
- Doctor reckons it was a heart attack.

02:39.404 --> 02:40.850
Poor old thing.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.651
I don't think she had
any family anymore.

02:42.657 --> 02:44.483
She hadn't had a visitor in years.

02:45.264 --> 02:48.576
- 34 years in this dump.
- Love you, Marge!

02:48.582 --> 02:50.485
- Bye, Marge.
- Maybe I was right...

02:50.491 --> 02:52.470
- Bye.
- maybe the only way out of here

02:52.476 --> 02:53.977
is in a box.

03:00.767 --> 03:01.967
See that?

03:02.454 --> 03:05.189
Pick up the pace, everybody!

03:05.275 --> 03:09.518
I want finished prototypes by the
time the Regional Manager gets here!

03:14.671 --> 03:16.469
What's the Freak doin' 'ere?

03:20.177 --> 03:21.746
Hey, that looks good though.

03:29.086 --> 03:30.485
May I help you?

03:30.491 --> 03:32.385
Oi, remember grinding these!

03:32.391 --> 03:34.775
Quite an impressive little
operation you have here.

03:35.181 --> 03:36.381
Thank you.

03:36.704 --> 03:38.671
The Governor's been very supportive.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.418
Huh.

03:42.482 --> 03:44.113
What do you want, Joan?

03:47.619 --> 03:50.353
Hey, that's one
*** in the works, right?

03:50.359 --> 03:52.441
I have a proposition for you.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.438
Can I just get a *** over here.

03:59.032 --> 04:01.245
I'll scratch your back...

04:04.005 --> 04:07.811
Now, why would you imagine that I
would risk bringing your contraband

04:07.817 --> 04:09.408
through my workshop?

04:10.118 --> 04:12.122
I understand that you
have your business, Joan,

04:12.128 --> 04:14.223
but I won't have you ruining mine.

04:15.614 --> 04:17.906
You're assuming you have a choice.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.464
This workshop is my domain.

04:22.465 --> 04:23.665
So...

04:24.093 --> 04:25.818
I acknowledge your offer,

04:26.412 --> 04:29.408
and I respectfully decline.

04:29.414 --> 04:30.881
Hey, watch it!

04:46.929 --> 04:48.235
Hey.

04:50.473 --> 04:52.005
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:53.121 --> 04:55.361
- Hey, did you sleep all right?
- Yeah.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.090
- Well, you just look a bit...
- No, I'm fine.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.508
- No, just tired.
- Oh,

04:58.514 --> 05:00.940
- I just needs some caffeine.
- Oh, okay.

05:01.041 --> 05:04.643
Oh, look, um, Mr Jackson just called me,

05:04.649 --> 05:06.964
- poor Marge died this morning.
- Mmm. Ohhh.

05:06.970 --> 05:09.904
- Yeah, natural causes. Yeah.
- Oh, that's terrible.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.570
Look, she didn't have
many close friends,

05:11.576 --> 05:13.691
- Mmm.
- but some of the women might want

05:13.697 --> 05:16.591
grief counselling, especially
if it gets them out of work.

05:16.597 --> 05:19.719
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Hope you're ready for a busy day.

05:20.184 --> 05:22.756
- Have you seen Superman II?
- No.

05:22.762 --> 05:25.763
Lex Luther escapes prison
with a hot-air balloon.

05:26.855 --> 05:29.552
We should do that, or what
about really tall stilts?

05:29.558 --> 05:31.763
Mmm, but can you run in stilts?

05:32.060 --> 05:33.720
I can run in stilettos.

05:47.021 --> 05:48.568
It has to be an officer supplying

05:48.574 --> 05:49.865
the drugs, this is how we'll stop them.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.285
I can't authorise a CSDS
search without evidence.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.664
Well, don't you wanna
undermine Ferguson?

05:53.670 --> 05:55.422
Channing is here tomorrow
for the workshop inspection,

05:55.428 --> 05:58.412
the last thing I need him thinking
is that I can't control my staff.

05:58.418 --> 06:00.233
You know how expensive
it is to call them in.

06:00.239 --> 06:01.734
You know what it does for staff morale.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.740
But all I care about
is protecting the women.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.502
Well, I need proof and I'm sorry, Will,

06:05.508 --> 06:07.712
but your gut instinct isn't evidence.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.773
Why did ya ***, Hannah.

06:18.885 --> 06:20.085
Oh, that looks good.

06:20.091 --> 06:21.369
What do you want?

06:21.375 --> 06:24.583
- A job.
- Ha-ha! No fuckin' way!

06:24.589 --> 06:25.865
It's not up to you.

06:25.871 --> 06:28.258
Fuckin' oaf it is, 'cause I'm the boss!

06:28.264 --> 06:30.386
Yeah, for real, so piss off!

06:30.392 --> 06:32.043
Is there a problem, Susan?

06:32.049 --> 06:34.078
Yeah, there is. This fat slag here

06:34.084 --> 06:36.563
thinks she can just walk
in and, like, get a job!

06:41.748 --> 06:44.545
So, you put me in a wheelchair...

06:44.740 --> 06:46.732
and then come and ask for a job.

06:46.738 --> 06:48.108
That's novel.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.482
Well, I've got heaps
of weldin' experience.

06:50.488 --> 06:52.928
Yeah, weldin' your fat
mouth around blokes' dicks!

06:52.934 --> 06:55.662
- I'm a dyke!
- Show some decorum please, ladies.

06:59.229 --> 07:00.925
I'll work really hard.

07:01.229 --> 07:02.940
You know, do whatever you want.

07:03.253 --> 07:05.672
And, um... well...

07:06.726 --> 07:08.136
I'm sorry.

07:08.526 --> 07:12.942
Oh, that's a very quick turn
around. Not the least suspicious.

07:15.514 --> 07:17.834
Oh, I dunno, it's up to you, Susan.

07:19.615 --> 07:21.014
But, um...

07:21.534 --> 07:23.657
I'm sure you can find something...

07:23.730 --> 07:25.745
fun for her to do.

07:29.730 --> 07:31.847
Come on, put your back into it.

07:36.897 --> 07:38.686
Well done, Susan.

07:42.397 --> 07:45.520
- Oh, hi, Allie.
- Hi.

07:45.823 --> 07:47.034
Glad I caught you,

07:47.040 --> 07:49.101
I heard about poor Marge,

07:49.503 --> 07:51.603
thought you might like
to come in for a chat.

07:51.826 --> 07:53.106
Um...

07:53.112 --> 07:56.129
Oh, nah, I'm okay, I...
I didn't really know her.

07:56.135 --> 07:57.645
Oh, right.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.867
I saw you with, um... Franky...

08:02.145 --> 08:03.544
earlier.

08:03.622 --> 08:05.698
You seem to be getting
along really well?

08:06.884 --> 08:08.084
Yeah.

08:08.090 --> 08:10.307
Yeah, this place can
really mess with your head.

08:10.313 --> 08:12.176
You know, especially
when you're vulnerable.

08:12.322 --> 08:14.499
I think it's probably best not to...

08:14.901 --> 08:16.808
well, not to...

08:17.195 --> 08:20.218
not to cross any boundaries
at the moment, you know.

08:20.224 --> 08:22.761
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, just that...

08:22.767 --> 08:24.749
when you've had feelings for
someone and you lose them,

08:24.755 --> 08:26.168
a common mistake is just...

08:26.174 --> 08:27.893
throw yourself into
another relationship,

08:27.899 --> 08:30.463
which is... not a solution at all.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.610
Okay, thanks.

08:34.001 --> 08:36.009
Well, if you ever need to
talk in depth, at more...

08:36.015 --> 08:37.836
y-you know where I am, okay?

08:39.229 --> 08:40.828
Jesus, Bridget!

08:44.947 --> 08:47.301
_

08:56.341 --> 08:58.119
This gonna take much longer?

08:58.617 --> 09:01.109
Why, you got somewhere to be?

09:02.012 --> 09:05.837
Do I sense an impending visit
from the Regional Manager?

09:07.313 --> 09:08.912
Vera seems to be in an awful panic

09:08.918 --> 09:10.431
to get everything looking shipshape.

09:10.437 --> 09:11.899
Just get back to work.

09:11.905 --> 09:13.923
It's not the machinery
they should be inspecting,

09:13.929 --> 09:15.899
it's her appalling leadership skills.

09:15.905 --> 09:17.751
I think they should have a look
at yours while they're at it.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.658
Shut up, Ferguson.

09:21.025 --> 09:22.559
I'll walk you out.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.454
I wonder how much
longer she can cling on?

09:32.111 --> 09:35.419
Yeah, it's been done.
Says I can stay and ***.

09:35.633 --> 09:36.928
Yeah, great.

09:37.001 --> 09:39.108
The conveyor belt in the laundry.

09:39.114 --> 09:42.226
- What about it?
- Well, it's gotta lead to a...

09:42.232 --> 09:44.435
I dunno, a loading dock
or something, right?

09:44.441 --> 09:46.372
Yeah, which'll be guarded
and need a swipe card.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.892
- Well, have you ever been out there?
- No, so?

09:48.898 --> 09:50.603
Worth checkin' out, right?

09:50.609 --> 09:52.470
Yeah, all right, I'll
get Smiles to let us in.

09:52.476 --> 09:54.799
Okay, cool. What if she asks questions?

09:56.353 --> 09:57.553
She won't.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.454
If she does just say you want me.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.827
Yeah, all right, that's good.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.421
- She reckons we're fucking anyway.
- What? Why?

10:03.427 --> 10:05.328
Oh, I dunno, she gave
me some weird lecture

10:05.334 --> 10:07.525
about not getting
involved on the rebound.

10:07.531 --> 10:09.235
I... I dunno. Come on,
let's go get Smiles.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.747
You check the yard, I'll check the
corridor and I'll meet ya at lunch.

10:11.753 --> 10:12.953
- Okay.
- Yeah?

10:13.841 --> 10:16.841
_

10:19.242 --> 10:20.442
_

10:20.448 --> 10:21.715
Do you want a hand?

10:22.135 --> 10:23.335
Nuh.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.403
Franky!

10:34.113 --> 10:35.513
Please.

10:40.836 --> 10:42.646
I'm not fucking Allie.

10:43.047 --> 10:44.777
I would not do that to you.

11:12.777 --> 11:13.977
Smiles.

11:14.582 --> 11:15.782
Smiles?!

11:15.788 --> 11:17.176
What's Allie doin'?

11:17.390 --> 11:18.763
She scoring?

11:18.769 --> 11:21.359
Got a favour to ask. Franky and I
need to get into the laundry.

11:21.365 --> 11:23.228
Could be Smiles bringin' the gear in.

11:23.322 --> 11:25.325
She'd do anything if
there's money in it.

11:26.784 --> 11:28.533
And there it is.

11:34.943 --> 11:37.374
- Jesus!
- What the fuck?!

11:37.842 --> 11:39.783
Did you just score off Linda?

11:39.789 --> 11:41.073
No!

11:41.079 --> 11:42.667
I thought you weren't
doin' that shit anymore.

11:42.673 --> 11:45.362
- I'm not.
- Then why did you give her money?!

11:47.260 --> 11:48.995
Why?

11:52.133 --> 11:53.713
Don't you fucking protect her.

11:53.719 --> 11:55.914
We know one of the
officers is bringing it in.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.127
Hey, only one officer ever gave me a hit

11:59.133 --> 12:00.829
- and it wasn't Smiles.
- Who?

12:04.055 --> 12:05.388
Mr Stewart.

12:05.555 --> 12:08.047
- Are you fucking kidding me?!
- I've gotta go.

12:13.773 --> 12:15.272
You've got ten minutes.

12:15.278 --> 12:18.125
Yeah, no worries. Reckon
I can get her off in five.

12:18.131 --> 12:19.617
That's rich!

12:46.612 --> 12:49.105
I think we need a little chat.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.918
What can you see?

12:51.034 --> 12:54.040
It's a whole heap of ***
and some locker bays.

12:54.046 --> 12:57.416
There's a couple of doors that
need swipe cards but no windows.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.618
Definitely not getting out this way.

13:02.933 --> 13:06.694
- Oh fuck, my foot is stuck! Go!
- Hurry up, Smiles'll be here in a minute.

13:10.395 --> 13:12.568
- C-come on... get out of there!
- Can you get it?!

13:54.820 --> 13:56.409
What the fuck do you want?!

13:56.415 --> 13:58.383
If it's a threesome
we're not interested.

13:58.389 --> 13:59.835
What are you doing in here?

14:00.201 --> 14:01.702
What does it look like?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.483
Get out!

14:04.194 --> 14:05.702
No wuckers.

14:07.795 --> 14:09.983
Kinda killed my ladyboner anyway.

14:21.490 --> 14:24.820
Allie told me Stewart gave
her drugs a while back.

14:24.826 --> 14:27.196
Jake, are you sure?

14:31.685 --> 14:34.829
I dunno if it was a one off,
but it sounds like he's got form.

14:39.007 --> 14:41.422
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

14:41.428 --> 14:43.641
Phones are now available for use.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.447
Put this back on the shelf.

14:54.386 --> 14:56.502
You look a little tired, Miss Westfall.

14:56.601 --> 14:57.801
Tough session?

14:57.994 --> 14:59.897
What the fuck do you want?

14:59.998 --> 15:04.100
I can see that this situation
with Franky Doyle is having a...

15:04.405 --> 15:06.653
a negative emotional impact.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.738
But, I think you should know
that you're wasting your energy.

15:09.744 --> 15:11.380
She's already moved on.

15:12.725 --> 15:14.597
I just saw her in the, uh...

15:16.582 --> 15:18.817
in the laundry with Novak.

15:19.565 --> 15:21.797
They were chewing at each other,

15:21.980 --> 15:23.386
like animals.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.137
Didn't take her long to trade-up

15:27.143 --> 15:29.222
to a younger, more
attractive model, did it?

15:42.318 --> 15:44.004
Why do you keep lying to me?

15:44.091 --> 15:45.291
Hey?

15:45.396 --> 15:48.242
And you gave Ferguson the
pleasure of telling me.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.189
No, look whatever
Ferguson said is bullshit.

15:51.195 --> 15:52.729
Now you're lying again.

15:53.184 --> 15:54.678
What Ferguson thinks she saw

15:54.684 --> 15:56.599
and what actually happened
are two different things.

15:56.605 --> 15:57.805
So, you're denying it?

15:59.919 --> 16:02.236
Fuckin' say something, Franky.

16:03.942 --> 16:06.543
- It's complicated.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

16:07.036 --> 16:09.224
It's really fuckin' simple.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.335
Fuck!

16:22.341 --> 16:23.541
I'm gonna come in early tomorrow,

16:23.547 --> 16:25.109
make sure everything's
ready for Channing.

16:25.115 --> 16:26.585
You let me know how I can help.

16:26.591 --> 16:28.209
Well, you can lock all
the women in their cells

16:28.215 --> 16:30.514
and stop Will badgering me about CSDS.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.164
What does he want with those guys.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.884
Oh, he thinks it's the best way

16:33.890 --> 16:35.862
to find out who's selling
drugs to the women.

16:35.868 --> 16:38.657
- Or just waste a shitload of money.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

16:38.853 --> 16:41.266
Do you know what I would love?

16:41.593 --> 16:43.024
Someone to cook me dinner

16:43.030 --> 16:45.038
and to choose me a decent movie.

16:45.044 --> 16:46.617
Now, that I can do.

16:46.828 --> 16:48.028
Okay.

16:48.491 --> 16:50.609
- Hey, Vera...
- Hey.

16:52.101 --> 16:53.687
what are you up to tonight?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.514
Um...

16:55.869 --> 16:59.204
- I really fancy a drink, maybe two.
- No, I'm s...

16:59.210 --> 17:01.262
I'd love to but, I can't, um...

17:01.494 --> 17:02.816
Channing's here tomorrow,
I've got a mountain

17:02.822 --> 17:05.222
- of paperwork to do. But maybe
- Oh, yeah, of course. Okay, no worries.

17:05.228 --> 17:06.612
- another time?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:07.519 --> 17:08.719
See ya, Bridget.

17:10.425 --> 17:11.823
If you wanna have a girls' night

17:11.829 --> 17:13.527
- I won't be offended.
- No, no, no, no. No.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.239
I really don't.

17:25.386 --> 17:27.599
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

17:27.606 --> 17:30.095
H Block are now called for breakfast.

17:30.101 --> 17:32.689
Now, we need the department's
final approval today,

17:32.695 --> 17:35.498
so, I want everyone on their
absolute best behaviour.

17:35.504 --> 17:36.990
Or I'll punch your tits in.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.659
What'd I tell you about
positive reinforcement?

17:40.580 --> 17:42.276
Oh, yeah, right. Um...

17:42.455 --> 17:46.243
So, like, if you do do a good
job, I won't punch your tits in.

17:46.249 --> 17:48.411
All right. So, what's the story,

17:48.417 --> 17:50.536
are you showing Channing
around the workshop?

17:50.542 --> 17:53.250
Yes we are, and Susan
and I will lead that tour.

17:53.256 --> 17:55.262
We're gonna show him
every part of the process.

17:55.268 --> 17:56.696
Growing the seedlings,

17:56.702 --> 17:58.038
making the frames,

17:58.044 --> 18:00.085
packing, shipping the final product.

18:00.091 --> 18:02.484
- Mmm? Actually, that reminds me...
- Excellent.

18:03.090 --> 18:04.290
Hey...

18:04.379 --> 18:06.287
if this Green Wall project kicks off

18:06.293 --> 18:08.449
they're gonna be sending
shipments out of the prison.

18:08.983 --> 18:10.188
Could be an option?

18:10.194 --> 18:12.366
Gonna ask Liz if we can
get into the seedling area.

18:12.372 --> 18:14.382
Hey, won't be a sec, eh.

18:15.359 --> 18:18.345
- Hey, Smiles, have you seen Westfall?
- No.

18:18.679 --> 18:20.876
Oh, I want an appointment.
Can you get me on the list?

18:20.882 --> 18:23.359
- Do I look like a secretary?
- Just do it, okay?!

18:23.733 --> 18:25.585
- What's got into you?
- Please?

18:26.226 --> 18:28.744
- All right.
- Thank you.

18:30.524 --> 18:33.520
_

18:35.024 --> 18:36.813
- Jake.
- Hey, mate.

18:37.271 --> 18:38.471
Hey, um...

18:38.880 --> 18:41.515
- I'm, heading out tonight, I, um...
- Where you going?

18:42.380 --> 18:43.706
Oh, just a club.

18:44.271 --> 18:45.471
Which club?

18:45.998 --> 18:47.785
Oh, dunno, I didn't choose it.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.702
Is this a date?

18:49.708 --> 18:52.123
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

18:52.306 --> 18:53.506
Hey, um...

18:53.705 --> 18:55.174
you got any gear?

18:55.180 --> 18:57.130
And they said romance was dead.

18:57.564 --> 18:58.892
You got anything?

18:59.613 --> 19:01.341
Oh, mate, um...

19:02.113 --> 19:03.690
remember what happened last time?

19:04.589 --> 19:06.011
I don't do that shit anymore.

19:07.282 --> 19:08.792
- It's too risky.
- Yeah.

19:08.798 --> 19:10.684
Sorry, mate.

19:17.498 --> 19:20.089
- Morning, Will.
- Hey, Mr Channing.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.900
How the fuck is Ferguson in charge?

19:24.906 --> 19:27.303
The women made their choice.

19:27.309 --> 19:28.777
I'm sure they'll come to regret it.

19:28.783 --> 19:31.517
Well, let's hope it's not you
that comes to regret it, hmm?

19:33.238 --> 19:36.081
So, this Green Wall
project was Stevens' idea?

19:36.938 --> 19:40.209
Yes, she's really motivated the
women. They all seem quite invested.

19:40.215 --> 19:43.211
Thank you. Oh, it's a a bit of a
come down from a cosmetics empire.

19:43.633 --> 19:46.351
Mm, still... I think
you'll like what you see.

19:46.445 --> 19:48.338
I hope so, for your sake.

19:49.148 --> 19:51.538
You could do with some
brownie points at the moment.

19:54.910 --> 19:58.112
No. Y-you can't just,
like, come in and take over.

19:58.118 --> 20:00.026
- Nup, I don't wanna take over, I j...
- Nup.

20:00.229 --> 20:02.323
Workshop's full, and like, I'm the boss.

20:02.329 --> 20:03.529
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.780
So, what I say goes, right...

20:05.786 --> 20:07.416
Power's gone to her head!

20:07.422 --> 20:10.340
Oh, shut your fuckin' mouth,
Stella, unless you wanna be fired.

20:10.346 --> 20:11.915
- Do ya?!
- Susan!

20:12.018 --> 20:13.634
How many times do we have to talk about

20:13.640 --> 20:15.552
- your language?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

20:15.558 --> 20:17.465
Come on, Booms, just do us a favour.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.625
Oh, yeah, nah...

20:20.631 --> 20:24.095
you just want in 'cause you know
I'm doin' somethin' cool, eh?

20:24.173 --> 20:25.373
Yeah.

20:25.478 --> 20:27.692
Yeah, well, nah.

20:27.698 --> 20:29.290
All right, no, Franky. Oh...

20:29.296 --> 20:33.494
This is for me, okay? It's just...
it's just for me. All right.

20:33.681 --> 20:36.182
You know, I don't want
you stealin' me thunder.

20:36.188 --> 20:37.716
I just wanna help.

20:38.143 --> 20:41.138
- No. Anyway*... No.
- Booms...

20:41.144 --> 20:42.770
- please.
- No. Don't!

20:42.776 --> 20:44.571
Don't you do that

20:44.577 --> 20:47.039
- sad Franky eyes stuff.
- What?

20:47.045 --> 20:49.282
Don't! I got shit to do,
all right? I gotta go.

20:49.717 --> 20:50.917
Oh.

20:53.225 --> 20:55.542
- All right, we'll find a way in.
- Yeah, we better.

20:55.548 --> 20:57.870
Couple more hours of this
shit, I'll be opening a vein.

20:58.738 --> 21:02.652
- You right there, ladies? All right.
- Yeah, great, Liz. Excellent.

21:04.827 --> 21:06.311
What's he doing here?

21:07.217 --> 21:08.417
Channing?

21:08.423 --> 21:10.671
He's the head honcho from Corrections.

21:15.623 --> 21:18.312
Now, I've decided to divide

21:18.318 --> 21:20.210
this workshop into two main areas,

21:20.216 --> 21:21.717
outside we grow the seedlings

21:21.723 --> 21:24.050
and in here is where
we assemble the frames,

21:24.056 --> 21:25.846
from scratch. Susan manages

21:25.852 --> 21:28.509
- this part of the process.
- Yeah. Yeah, I manage the...

21:28.944 --> 21:32.034
Um, did you wanna see
us do some shit? Duh...

21:33.221 --> 21:36.056
Uh, I meant, do you wanna
see us put together a frame...

21:36.158 --> 21:38.527
- or somethin'? Okay, cool.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

21:38.533 --> 21:40.666
Oi, move your fat arse, come on,

21:47.178 --> 21:48.511
Yeah, all right, go!

21:49.194 --> 21:50.585
As you can see, Mr Channing,

21:50.591 --> 21:52.786
we're able to assemble
these frames quite quickly,

21:52.792 --> 21:55.616
so I imagine we'll be able to
grow the business exponentially.

21:55.702 --> 21:58.456
And, of course, once they are
assembled they're painted over there,

21:58.462 --> 22:00.280
packed over there and
collected and shipped out.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.118
It's a very efficient operation.

22:02.124 --> 22:03.978
Well, it'd be more
efficient if we could get

22:03.984 --> 22:05.607
some more weldin' gear in here.

22:08.024 --> 22:09.798
Oi, hey, remember,

22:09.804 --> 22:11.875
- you don't get to talk, all right?
- Oh, piss off!

22:11.881 --> 22:14.212
Nah, we rehearsed this,
ya fuckin' goldfish.

22:14.218 --> 22:16.032
Let me and Sonia do the talkin'!

22:16.038 --> 22:18.242
- Susan!
- Oh, I can weld better than her too.

22:18.248 --> 22:19.492
D'you wanna see?

22:19.498 --> 22:20.698
Hey, give me that.

22:20.945 --> 22:22.785
- Hey! Fuckin' get off
- Radic, back away please!

22:22.791 --> 22:25.334
- and let someone else have a go!
- No, I'm the boss!

22:25.340 --> 22:26.750
Stop hoggin' the fuckin' gear

22:26.756 --> 22:28.045
- ya dumb bitch!
- Now, hey, hey...

22:28.051 --> 22:29.449
- Jenkins!
- Booms,

22:29.455 --> 22:30.949
- just let her have a go...
- No... fuckin'... way!

22:30.955 --> 22:33.008
- Radic!
- Stella, no pushing, love.

22:33.014 --> 22:34.611
- What are ya gonna do, eh?
- No pushing, Stell... !

22:34.617 --> 22:35.874
- Oh!
- Ooh!

22:35.880 --> 22:37.570
Go for it, Liz!

22:37.576 --> 22:40.057
- Yeah, give it to him!
- Havin' a good root?!

22:40.063 --> 22:42.307
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Mr...

22:42.313 --> 22:44.239
- I'm so sorry, Mr Channing.
- Get the fuck off me!

22:44.245 --> 22:45.916
Oi, Liz, does he like you on top?

22:45.922 --> 22:49.483
- Shut the fuck up!
- Everybody calm down!

22:49.489 --> 22:50.706
- Are you okay?
- Get me out of here.

22:50.712 --> 22:52.183
Oh, is that your wank hand?!

22:52.189 --> 22:54.787
- Slot her!
- Why? It wasn't even my fault.

22:54.793 --> 22:56.628
I'm so sorry, Mr Channing,
it was an accident. I...

22:56.634 --> 22:58.698
- Stay the fuck away from me!
- It was an acci...

23:03.213 --> 23:05.044
That workshop is a disaster.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.020
It's a danger to the
officers and the women.

23:07.026 --> 23:08.346
- Shut it down!
- Look, I actually think

23:08.352 --> 23:10.448
- that was a mistake...
- Shut it down!

23:10.580 --> 23:12.909
Argh!

23:19.193 --> 23:21.888
What were you thinking, giving
those bitches welding gear?

23:21.894 --> 23:24.416
The Department did approve
the trial, and with respect,

23:24.422 --> 23:26.148
it wasn't the welding
gear that was the problem.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.571
Well, I'm surprised they haven't
killed each other already.

23:30.377 --> 23:33.477
Vera, just... just
get it shut down ASAP.

23:33.942 --> 23:35.654
I'll inform Stevens now.

23:38.632 --> 23:40.042
So...

23:40.640 --> 23:42.358
will I live?

23:42.364 --> 23:44.841
If you're a good boy and
you stay out of trouble.

23:44.847 --> 23:47.956
Oh... where's the fun in that?

23:52.034 --> 23:53.626
- I want to talk to him.
- That's not possible.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.692
- I would like to negotiate.
- Mr Channing has made his decision!

23:56.698 --> 23:58.298
I will not be shut down!

23:58.877 --> 24:00.790
You don't have a choice.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.462
Pack up this equipment. Do it quickly.

24:20.730 --> 24:22.800
I'm sorry, everybody,

24:24.011 --> 24:26.041
we are being shut down...

24:27.115 --> 24:32.854
because of the actions of
one stupid individual...

24:34.302 --> 24:36.680
Elizabeth Birdsworth.

24:38.118 --> 24:39.350
Me?

24:39.443 --> 24:41.037
Sonia that was an accident.

24:41.043 --> 24:43.667
- I did...
- Shut the fuck up!

24:44.247 --> 24:45.579
Look at you!

24:45.670 --> 24:48.865
All the airs and graces of a cart horse!

24:48.871 --> 24:52.315
You have single-handedly
ruined this entire operation.

24:52.321 --> 24:54.203
Dashed the hopes of all these women.

24:54.209 --> 24:57.119
You are a total liability
and a complete waste of space.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.899
You should be ashamed of yourself.

24:59.297 --> 25:02.203
- Sonia, I...
- Get out of my workshop!

25:25.409 --> 25:27.009
We might have a problem.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.939
- Concerning?
- Jackson. I think he's suss.

25:30.798 --> 25:33.314
Officer Jackson's two brain cells are

25:33.320 --> 25:37.725
generally occupied with
eating and breathing.

25:37.731 --> 25:40.219
- Don't worry about him.
- Channing shut down the workshop,

25:40.225 --> 25:42.578
so there's no chance of using
it as a supply route anyway.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.522
I'm sure you'll find an alternative.

25:54.191 --> 25:56.996
Such a shame about
your little enterprise.

25:57.277 --> 25:59.474
Managing these women, it's a...

25:59.691 --> 26:01.480
it's a fine art isn't it?

26:01.902 --> 26:03.875
Big job for a little lady...

26:04.124 --> 26:05.426
in a wheelchair.

26:05.432 --> 26:07.254
Actually, you've disappointed me, Joan,

26:07.260 --> 26:09.381
I expected something a bit more...

26:09.656 --> 26:11.252
visceral.

26:11.445 --> 26:14.414
You really don't want
me as an enemy, Stevens.

26:16.724 --> 26:18.200
For the record...

26:20.039 --> 26:22.630
I don't respond well to intimidation.

26:32.687 --> 26:35.086
I can fix this.

26:35.092 --> 26:36.808
Oh, you think so?

26:37.048 --> 26:40.131
If I can get the Green
Wall project reinstated...

26:40.626 --> 26:43.033
me and Franky get jobs in the workshop.

26:43.039 --> 26:44.239
Okay?

26:44.732 --> 26:46.652
What are you, a miracle worker?

26:47.844 --> 26:49.044
Leave it with me.

26:53.555 --> 26:55.568
Ms Westfall, uh...

26:56.219 --> 26:59.155
Birdsworth needs to
see you, she insisted.

26:59.161 --> 27:00.653
Also, Doyle needs an appointment,

27:00.659 --> 27:02.668
Oh, right, okay.

27:03.977 --> 27:05.899
- Oh, hey. Look, I didn't... didn't know
- Yeah?

27:05.905 --> 27:08.729
who else to speak to, 'cause Ms
Bennett's busy with Mr Channing...

27:08.735 --> 27:11.514
- What happened?
- Um, it's Sonia, she... she

27:11.520 --> 27:13.201
- attacked me, in front of the women.
- Attacked you?!

27:13.207 --> 27:15.702
Yeah, verbally. So, we were in the
workshop and there was an accident

27:15.708 --> 27:17.781
and she's blaming me. Which
doesn't make any sense,

27:17.787 --> 27:20.382
so I'm thinking that she's
figured out that I'm Witness X

27:20.388 --> 27:21.976
- Oh, God, Liz. Liz, Liz, Liz.
- and I'm tryin'...

27:21.982 --> 27:23.499
- Slow down, you're doin' my head in.
- What?

27:24.078 --> 27:25.484
I'm sure you're just overreacting.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.679
I mean the women in here they
lose their tempers all the time

27:27.685 --> 27:30.367
and I'm sure Franky didn't
mean anything by that, darling.

27:30.373 --> 27:33.287
- Sonia. Yeah.
- Sonia. Sonia, sorry. Yeah.

27:33.293 --> 27:36.074
So, were you even
listening to me just then?

27:36.183 --> 27:37.509
Liz, I've got a lot to do

27:37.515 --> 27:39.597
- this afternoon. Come on, let's...
- No, no, no, no, no. No, hey, hey.

27:39.800 --> 27:43.164
- You're here to help us, okay.
- Mmm.

27:44.972 --> 27:46.675
You've been drinking.

27:47.402 --> 27:50.691
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Jesus Christ, you are pissed.

27:50.697 --> 27:51.926
No wonder you're tryin' to get

27:51.932 --> 27:53.772
- rid of me.
- Liz, I had a glass of wine at lunch,

27:53.778 --> 27:55.019
would you like to keep your voice down,

27:55.025 --> 27:56.878
- thank you?
- Right, so how are we supposed to

27:56.884 --> 27:58.088
come to you and confide in you,

27:58.094 --> 28:00.804
when you're going out
to lunch, getting pissed.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.269
You don't know what
you're talking about.

28:02.275 --> 28:03.508
Oh, trust me, love,

28:03.514 --> 28:07.115
I know everything there is
to know about secret drinking.

28:07.491 --> 28:09.403
I wrote the frigging book.

28:10.187 --> 28:12.280
Jesus Christ!

28:21.825 --> 28:24.041
Ms Bennett, can I have a quick word?

28:24.047 --> 28:26.041
- Birdsworth!
- Uh, it's private.

28:27.362 --> 28:28.761
What's the problem?

28:30.073 --> 28:33.855
I just tried to see Miss
Westfall and there's a situation.

28:33.948 --> 28:35.656
Well, you need to elaborate.

28:35.878 --> 28:38.734
I'm worried she's gonna blab
about the Witness X stuff.

28:39.776 --> 28:41.772
Why on Earth would she do that?

28:41.778 --> 28:43.016
'Cause she's not herself.

28:43.017 --> 28:44.917
- Trust me. No, I'm not.
- I think you're being paranoid.

28:45.061 --> 28:45.645
- I swear.
- Liz,

28:45.646 --> 28:47.301
- you are making no sense.
- Okay.

28:47.781 --> 28:50.510
She's been drinking. Right?

28:51.308 --> 28:52.908
She's pissed.

28:53.003 --> 28:54.834
You go and see for yourself.

28:56.628 --> 28:57.995
Get back to your unit.

29:05.705 --> 29:09.003
- I was just coming to see you.
- I'm going home. I don't feel well.

29:09.503 --> 29:13.424
- I think we should talk.
- Sorry, Vera. I'll call you later.

29:31.424 --> 29:33.369
In case you ever need
a friend at the top.

29:33.517 --> 29:34.717
Mm.

29:42.721 --> 29:45.201
You don't remember me.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.412
We used to call you Golden Showers.

29:53.022 --> 29:55.576
Do your bosses know
that you owned a brothel?

29:56.201 --> 29:58.397
Do they know what you did to us?

30:06.242 --> 30:08.377
You might wanna shut your mouth.

30:08.383 --> 30:10.625
Well, see that's the thing...

30:11.148 --> 30:13.156
silence is golden.

30:19.993 --> 30:23.056
I'd like to repeat my request
for a CSDS search of the officers.

30:23.062 --> 30:24.376
Well, unless something has changed...

30:24.382 --> 30:25.958
- Something has changed.
- we are exact... Okay, what?

30:25.964 --> 30:27.742
Look, I'm just asking you to trust me.

30:27.865 --> 30:30.626
Yeah, if it backfires I'm
the one who pays the price.

30:30.632 --> 30:32.437
Channing is already on the warpath.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.727
Will...

30:35.856 --> 30:37.837
if you could just give
us a moment, please.

30:37.843 --> 30:39.043
Sure.

30:40.228 --> 30:42.845
- Ah, how's the wrist?
- Oh, it's fine.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.432
Yes, Nurse Radcliffe looked after me.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.119
Now, Vera, it appears that
I might have been a bit hasty

30:50.125 --> 30:52.158
in shutting down the Green Wall project.

30:52.432 --> 30:57.066
Now, one person's actions shouldn't
affect all the other women.

30:58.989 --> 31:01.474
No, well, actually I
think you are right.

31:01.708 --> 31:05.206
A project like that is too much
responsibility for one prisoner.

31:05.909 --> 31:08.248
Well, Stevens seems very capable.

31:08.254 --> 31:10.850
Mm, she's also highly manipulative
and potentially dangerous.

31:10.856 --> 31:12.056
Vera...

31:12.574 --> 31:15.484
she's a fuckin' twig in a wheelchair.

31:16.493 --> 31:18.147
Now, I'm going to reverse my decision.

31:18.153 --> 31:20.303
The Green Wall project
can proceed as planned.

31:20.309 --> 31:23.173
Mm-hmm. So, what changed your mind?

31:23.493 --> 31:24.902
Oh, it was...

31:25.164 --> 31:28.144
emotional, judgemental, it's
never a good combination.

31:28.641 --> 31:30.156
I'll see myself out.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.838
Well, I-I'd like your
directions in writing.

31:32.844 --> 31:34.720
I'll put my concerns
on the record as well.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.712
Just... cut and paste
from the last time.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.539
- We're back in business!
- Right, wow!

31:41.545 --> 31:43.172
Oh, good.

31:43.178 --> 31:45.764
- So, like, when do we start work?
- First thing tomorrow morning.

31:45.770 --> 31:47.256
Everything's back to normal.

31:47.262 --> 31:48.462
- Awesome.
- Mmm.

31:48.468 --> 31:50.382
I tell ya... I tell ya, Stella's lucky.

31:50.388 --> 31:53.606
'Cause I was, like, gonna
shiv the bitch. I was. I was.

31:54.514 --> 31:57.312
Hey... hey... ahem...

31:57.318 --> 32:01.297
like, how... how come you went bunta
at Liz when it was Stella's fault?

32:02.172 --> 32:04.594
Mm, don't worry about
the workplace politics.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.699
Just focus on doing a good job.

32:06.705 --> 32:08.595
Oh yeah, no, I will, I promise. I-I...

32:08.601 --> 32:09.929
I won't let you down.

32:09.935 --> 32:12.085
I knew Channing was fucked up but...

32:12.091 --> 32:15.187
- I didn't think he'd own a brothel.
- So fucking disgusting. I can't believe

32:15.193 --> 32:17.185
- he's in charge of this place.
- I can't...

32:17.563 --> 32:18.763
Smiles...

32:19.056 --> 32:21.454
did you manage to organise
that counselling appointment?

32:21.460 --> 32:24.444
I passed on your message to Miss
Westfall, but she went home sick.

32:24.821 --> 32:26.021
Right. Okay.

32:26.258 --> 32:29.461
- Why do you need counselling?
- Just wanna keep in their good books.

32:32.710 --> 32:35.594
- Find someplace else to sit.
- Oh... !

32:45.612 --> 32:48.567
Congratulations on
the, uh, reinstatement.

32:49.575 --> 32:52.176
If you're still asking
to use my workshop...

32:52.302 --> 32:55.294
the answer's still... no!

32:55.846 --> 32:58.575
It's important for you to
be in control, isn't it?

32:59.353 --> 33:00.817
I understand that.

33:02.038 --> 33:03.664
I understand you...

33:04.713 --> 33:06.295
better than anyone.

33:07.383 --> 33:10.181
I think we share certain qualities.

33:11.202 --> 33:14.840
I mean, that garden project isn't
just about status and power, is it?

33:15.398 --> 33:17.325
It's a distraction from...

33:22.721 --> 33:25.172
I heard about your
little... outburst earlier.

33:25.835 --> 33:28.051
- Mm.
- Failure's not an option.

33:28.057 --> 33:30.383
I won't let anyone stand in my way.

33:30.389 --> 33:32.710
But one day someone will, won't they?

33:33.387 --> 33:35.617
They will get in your way,

33:37.165 --> 33:39.753
and then those primal
urges will kick in,

33:39.759 --> 33:42.403
and once again you're gonna
have blood on your hands.

33:44.384 --> 33:47.335
When that time comes, you're
gonna need someone you can rely on.

33:49.647 --> 33:51.755
I see who you are...

33:54.065 --> 33:55.850
and I respect it.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.182
I understand it.

34:02.950 --> 34:05.482
We could be very useful allies.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.197
So, do we have a deal.

34:20.983 --> 34:22.531
We're back on.

34:22.536 --> 34:24.072
Take care of Jackson.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.856
- Hi.
- Bridget?

34:35.862 --> 34:38.860
Sorry, I just, um,
needed to talk to someone.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.079
- I'm sorry.
- No, come in.

34:41.085 --> 34:42.976
- Come in. Come in.
- Thanks.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.597
You've been drinking.

34:49.603 --> 34:50.956
Oh...

34:50.962 --> 34:53.683
I've just been trying
to blot it all out,

34:53.688 --> 34:55.297
you know, and I've made it...

34:55.485 --> 34:57.367
I've made it worse, Vera.

34:57.556 --> 35:01.200
I am so sorry about
today. I bailed on you.

35:01.390 --> 35:02.703
And I'm...

35:03.601 --> 35:07.520
I'm just not coping and I miss her,
you know. I don't know what to do.

35:07.745 --> 35:09.333
- Does... Um...
- It's all right.

35:09.339 --> 35:11.542
- I can't work it out.
- It's all right.

35:14.268 --> 35:16.501
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

35:20.467 --> 35:22.081
Do you have to be somewhere?

35:22.198 --> 35:23.807
No. It's just...

35:24.304 --> 35:25.504
No, it doesn't matter.

35:25.510 --> 35:27.258
I'm so sorry, Vera.

35:27.264 --> 35:30.047
You're just the only one that
understands this situation.

35:30.053 --> 35:32.163
It's okay, but Bridget you can't...

35:32.169 --> 35:35.031
- turn up to work like that.
- Yeah, I know.

35:35.037 --> 35:36.794
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

35:37.050 --> 35:39.178
If it happens again I
can't turn a blind eye.

35:39.184 --> 35:40.895
It won't happen again, I promise.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.599
- Oh, who's that?
- Um...

35:45.811 --> 35:48.476
- There's something you need to know.
- Get your gear off, here come Jakey!

35:49.387 --> 35:51.208
Oh, shit. Hi, Bridget.

35:51.214 --> 35:52.414
Um...

35:53.613 --> 35:57.013
Jake and I are in a relationship.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.488
- Sorry, I didn't realise...
- No, it's okay. So...

35:59.662 --> 36:01.467
How long's this been going on for?

36:01.473 --> 36:04.129
A while... we're living together.

36:04.708 --> 36:06.645
Why didn't you tell me?

36:06.651 --> 36:08.805
She was worried what
the staff would think.

36:10.714 --> 36:14.027
- I wouldn't have said anything.
- Oh, I know, but...

36:14.191 --> 36:16.072
Look, I was a bit paranoid.

36:16.078 --> 36:17.617
Don't you trust me?

36:17.623 --> 36:19.734
Oh, of course I do. It...

36:20.140 --> 36:22.136
it's a tricky situation.

36:22.727 --> 36:25.079
- All right. I'm gonna head off.
- Oh...

36:25.085 --> 36:26.411
- You don't have to go.
- No, no, no.

36:26.417 --> 36:28.645
- I don't want to ruin your evening.
- No, you're not.

36:28.651 --> 36:30.247
I'll call a cab, okay.

36:30.253 --> 36:31.855
- Bri... Bridget.
- I'll see you later.

36:35.872 --> 36:37.417
You should've texted.

36:51.494 --> 36:53.986
What the hell are the CSDS doing here?!

36:58.323 --> 37:00.121
It's a waste of time and money.

37:00.127 --> 37:01.629
I mean, how are we
supposed to do our jobs

37:01.635 --> 37:04.214
with them breathing down
our necks? It's ridiculous.

37:08.914 --> 37:10.148
Step away from your locker,

37:10.154 --> 37:11.946
- please. This is a search.
- Fuck!

37:11.952 --> 37:14.303
Please drop what you're
doing and step aside.

37:14.309 --> 37:15.658
Come on. Come on.

37:19.053 --> 37:20.677
Hey, is anyone in the bathroom?

37:20.683 --> 37:21.883
Yeah.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.575
- Get him out of there.
- Can you hear me?

37:28.581 --> 37:30.296
- If there's anyone in there
- Yeah, I'm coming!

37:32.139 --> 37:34.662
- ***
- Fuck!

37:34.862 --> 37:36.556
Get in there!

37:36.562 --> 37:37.762
Hands.

37:41.353 --> 37:42.894
It won't take long. Just...

37:50.592 --> 37:53.173
All... clear.

37:54.404 --> 37:55.937
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

37:58.412 --> 38:00.554
I told you that was a waste of time.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.792
What made you change your
mind about calling them in?

38:02.798 --> 38:05.766
I told Mr Stewart about your suspicions

38:05.772 --> 38:08.041
and he agreed that we
should look into it.

38:08.131 --> 38:09.875
Should've ignored the pair of you.

38:10.069 --> 38:11.957
Next time I'll trust
my own gut instinct.

38:18.966 --> 38:20.250
Hey.

38:24.042 --> 38:25.862
Oh! Fuck off, argh!

38:26.019 --> 38:27.511

38:27.517 --> 38:28.808
What are you talking about?!

38:28.814 --> 38:31.399
You tried it once with the
piss-test, you motherfucker!

38:31.405 --> 38:33.761
What, are you fucking crazy?!
Get the fuck off you... Argh!

38:33.767 --> 38:36.199
- Fuck! Shit!
- Huh?

38:36.426 --> 38:39.535
You steal my job and then
you try to get me arrested?

38:39.541 --> 38:41.451
- But, you're making a mistake.
- Hey,

38:41.457 --> 38:43.816
you might have fooled
Vera but not me, okay.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.294
Mate, you're the one
that asked me for the

38:45.300 --> 38:47.763

38:47.769 --> 38:48.995
You're fuckin' crazy.

38:49.001 --> 38:50.600
- I could have you reported for this.
- Yeah?

38:50.606 --> 38:53.138
Do you want me to call Vera, eh?

38:56.622 --> 38:57.822
Yeah.

38:57.945 --> 38:59.145
Ah!

39:03.993 --> 39:05.368
I'm onto you.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.281
You fuckin' arsehole!

39:12.803 --> 39:14.842
So, if you are gonna... work here...

39:16.855 --> 39:21.476

rules. Okay, you listening?

39:21.543 --> 39:22.743
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

39:22.871 --> 39:25.244
All right. Rule number one...

39:25.873 --> 39:27.921

39:29.011 --> 39:30.500
Rule number two...

39:30.506 --> 39:32.221
is I'm in charge.

39:32.227 --> 39:33.697
Guess what rule number three is?

39:33.703 --> 39:34.903
Ooh... ?

39:34.986 --> 39:36.907

- Fuckin' bingo!

39:37.425 --> 39:40.165
- All right, so don't stuff it up.
- Thanks, Booms.

39:40.214 --> 39:41.414

39:41.682 --> 39:43.831
Oh well, it might be kinda...

39:44.315 --> 39:45.691
nice to have you around.

39:45.697 --> 39:48.323
- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Ow! Yeah.

39:48.329 --> 39:50.034
Just... start work.

39:52.104 --> 39:53.805
I guess you were right...

39:54.930 --> 39:56.832
you'll be leaving here in a box.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.827
Doyle, Ms Westfall will see you now.

40:05.698 --> 40:06.921
What's goin' on?

40:07.010 --> 40:08.323
What are ya doin'?

40:09.823 --> 40:11.220
I resigned.

40:11.485 --> 40:14.011
Nuh. No fuckin' way.

40:14.017 --> 40:16.391
I can't be here anymore.

40:16.712 --> 40:20.244
I swear, there's nothin'
goin' on between Allie and I.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.106
I don't care about Allie.

40:22.485 --> 40:24.417
I care about you.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.683
And I fell really fuckin' hard

40:27.689 --> 40:29.203
and... and I can't deal with this.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.890
I can't be here and
not be with you anymore.

40:31.896 --> 40:34.393
Well, give me some
time and I can fix that.

40:34.979 --> 40:36.512
How are you gonna do that?

40:38.175 --> 40:40.599
I dunno, just don't leave me.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.369
All I think day and night is you.

40:45.375 --> 40:47.897
So, stay.

40:47.961 --> 40:51.053
- Don't give up on us.
- Look at me, Franky.

40:51.946 --> 40:54.419
Look at me, I'm a mess.

40:55.281 --> 40:58.975
I can't look in the mirror.
I can't even see myself.

40:59.070 --> 41:02.867
If you just hang in there, I'll
find a way for us to be together.

41:02.981 --> 41:04.949
We can get out of this place.

41:04.955 --> 41:06.577
We'll go to another fuckin' country.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.589
We'll start fresh. We'll start again.

41:09.286 --> 41:10.778
You're dreaming.

41:12.009 --> 41:14.197
We have to make a clean break...

41:14.977 --> 41:16.735
for both our sakes.

41:19.809 --> 41:21.389
Cor*, so that's it?

41:23.996 --> 41:26.219
I fuckin' love you!

41:26.225 --> 41:28.480
I fuckin' love you, too.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.045
It's not over.

41:31.411 --> 41:33.030
Bye, Franky.

41:34.823 --> 41:36.718
No, we're not done!

41:53.382 --> 41:54.582
Hey!

41:54.859 --> 41:56.296
What's wrong?

42:03.660 --> 42:04.947
Franky, what the f... ?

42:06.851 --> 42:08.301
Franky, fu...

42:08.307 --> 42:10.484
Franky? Fuck!

42:10.490 --> 42:12.528
Ooh.

42:12.534 --> 42:13.911
Let's do this.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.469
Oh, God, this is wrong.

42:21.034 --> 42:22.367
You sure about that?

42:24.974 --> 42:26.480
No.

42:32.752 --> 42:35.631
Do it.

42:35.637 --> 42:38.970
Wait! Wait.

42:38.976 --> 42:42.271
I can't, it's too soon.

42:42.579 --> 42:45.978
Yeah, I know.

42:45.984 --> 42:48.899
Just forget about it.
