[ Chuckles evilly ]

20:41.107 --> 20:44.242
It was all for the moo-box.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.410
[ Laughs ]

20:46.412 --> 20:47.878
I love this show.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.748
Me too. You never know
what's coming.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.084
I'm Anne, by the way.
Just moved in down the street.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.120
Honey! This new one's
making her move!

20:56.122 --> 20:57.588
That's a wig.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.823
Wha...?

21:12.272 --> 21:15.039
Yeah, a few vigorous laps
in the pool will...

21:15.041 --> 21:16.240
What happened to the pool?!

21:16.242 --> 21:18.542
The HOA voted against it.

21:18.544 --> 21:21.279
Turns out a lot of people
thought it was tacky.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.047
Like that vest you had.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.751
Do you want me
to get you a jar, Dad?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.352
I know where they are!
