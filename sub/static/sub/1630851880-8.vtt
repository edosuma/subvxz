A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
EIGHT MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND THREE MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:32.416 --> 00:35.791
Hey, Lina, how are you?
I heard the news. Congratulations!

00:35.875 --> 00:39.250
I'm jealous. I've always wanted
to do something like that.

00:39.833 --> 00:42.541
You can tell me all about it
when we see each other, okay?

00:42.625 --> 00:43.625
Okay, bye.

01:21.833 --> 01:25.583
So, this is for 105 and 109.

01:25.666 --> 01:26.500
Okay.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.708
-Well… you'd take 104.
-Great.

01:29.791 --> 01:31.958
-And then for 103…
-103.

01:32.041 --> 01:34.791
…you need to add one gram of paracetamol.

01:34.875 --> 01:35.916
For Paco?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.708
-Yes.
-Okay.

01:37.791 --> 01:39.875
-Great.
-Perfect.

01:39.958 --> 01:41.458
Okay, that's everything then.

01:45.166 --> 01:47.916
Emilia's annoyed.
She says she hardly sees you anymore.

01:48.416 --> 01:49.541
That's nice of her.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.541
She'll miss you a lot.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.041
Well, we all will.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.666
Hey, Lina.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.583
Yeah?

01:58.250 --> 01:59.166
Thank you so much.

02:00.791 --> 02:01.625
For?

02:02.125 --> 02:05.500
This wasn't a permanent position,
and I got it thanks to you.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.583
And my boyfriend's moving here too.

02:08.666 --> 02:11.958
And, well, we're looking for an apartment,
but it's tough.

02:12.750 --> 02:13.875
Where are you looking?

02:14.708 --> 02:18.375
Anywhere. I'd love to live
near the hospital, but there's nothing.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.166
Well, mine is nearby.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.916
I can talk to the landlord,
you can take a look and,

02:26.833 --> 02:28.666
if you like it, it's all yours.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.166
Is it big enough for two?

02:30.791 --> 02:31.666
Yes.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.666
I shared it with someone for a long time.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.416
Hello.

02:43.166 --> 02:44.000
Hi.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.083
I texted you.

02:47.291 --> 02:48.208
I saw that.

02:51.625 --> 02:52.875
Want me to leave you alone?

02:54.791 --> 02:56.250
I can be alone with you here.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.291
Any plans for the summer?

03:07.666 --> 03:08.916
I'm getting out of here.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.500
I'm going to the beach with friends.

03:14.375 --> 03:15.208
Cool.

03:15.875 --> 03:16.708
How about you?

03:19.041 --> 03:23.333
Well, I have to move out
and I want to spend a few days in Morocco.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.083
After that, I'll come back

03:29.041 --> 03:30.250
and say bye to everyone.

03:31.625 --> 03:32.791
Will you say bye to me?

03:34.041 --> 03:34.916
No.

03:35.833 --> 03:36.666
No?

03:37.250 --> 03:38.083
No.

03:44.041 --> 03:44.875
Are you nervous?

03:45.916 --> 03:47.041
To be honest, I'm not.

03:47.958 --> 03:48.958
Well,

03:49.041 --> 03:51.125
you will be, as the date gets closer.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.041
Or not.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.625
Aren't you excited?

04:00.125 --> 04:02.625
When I found out I'd got it,
I didn't feel anything.

04:03.666 --> 04:04.500
I don't know.

04:06.541 --> 04:07.500
Well, the truth is,

04:09.041 --> 04:10.125
it's a big change.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.708
That's what I thought, that…

04:14.583 --> 04:15.958
I thought it might be

04:16.041 --> 04:18.625
the fear of changing countries, homes,

04:19.125 --> 04:19.958
friends.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.458
I plan to visit you.

04:25.125 --> 04:25.958
Right.

04:29.041 --> 04:29.875
I don't know.

04:32.291 --> 04:36.166
It's like I know I should be happy,
because it's good for me, and

04:36.875 --> 04:38.041
deep down, I know that.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.000
But I just can't feel happy.

04:43.916 --> 04:44.750
Why?

04:47.708 --> 04:49.708
I know it's crappy to say this, because…

04:51.333 --> 04:53.875
It's horrible
when you need someone to be excited

04:54.708 --> 04:56.583
about something you've wanted for years.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.041
But I would have loved
to share it with him.

05:25.708 --> 05:26.750
LINA RUIZ
NURSE

05:33.666 --> 05:36.375
Hi, Lina.
Could you come with me for a second?

05:36.458 --> 05:38.791
-I need your help.
-Is something wrong?

05:38.875 --> 05:40.333
No, everything's fine.

05:40.916 --> 05:41.750
Can you come?

05:42.250 --> 05:43.583
Yes, I'll be right there.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.458
Surprise!

06:10.833 --> 06:12.208
Thank you so much.

06:12.291 --> 06:14.666
You're sweet, you're all emotional.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.375
Come on, tell us. When are you leaving?

06:17.458 --> 06:19.666
I'm leaving on October 21st.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.583
-That's really soon.
-Yeah.

06:21.666 --> 06:22.916
What will you do there?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.958
I'm going to a kids' hospital in Palampur.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.375
-Where's that?
-In India.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.875
-That's lovely.
-How long are you staying there?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.958
Well, I don't know.

06:33.041 --> 06:36.166
-You'll come back here after, right?
-I don't know that either.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.041
Want some more champagne?

06:43.833 --> 06:44.750
I do.

06:44.833 --> 06:45.958
There you go.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.541
-No, thank you.
-Are you ready?

06:50.625 --> 06:53.000
-For what?
-To replace Lina.

06:54.583 --> 06:57.125
Well, I'll try, yeah.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.208
She's set the bar high.

07:00.458 --> 07:02.291
-No pressure, okay?
-Yeah.

07:16.416 --> 07:17.500
No, and you?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.750
Look. This is Lina, my girlfriend.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.750
-Let me introduce you. Oli…
-Hi.

07:27.833 --> 07:30.333
…my work partner in the mornings.
And Alberto.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.208
-Alberto, nice to meet you.
-Hi.

07:32.291 --> 07:35.708
Relax, I was a newbie once too.
Your boyfriend's a hoot.

07:35.791 --> 07:38.500
He dressed up like an old dude
for a futurist party.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.625
-Elderly man. Show some respect.
-This is his vision of the future.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.875
I see it more like a diva from Mars.

07:44.458 --> 07:47.750
-He's the only one who had that idea.
-I like it.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.708
It's important to be original.

07:49.791 --> 07:50.625
It's different.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.541
Well,
let's see how original your classes are.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.958
-There's a photo booth.
-Really?

07:56.041 --> 07:58.416
-Let's go take some pictures.
-Let's go.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.833
-Bye.
-He's such an idiot.

07:59.916 --> 08:00.875
Yeah, I saw you.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.125
CAPSULE

08:56.000 --> 08:57.416
This booth looks great.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.333
What is it?

09:02.333 --> 09:05.541
-I really like this little scar.
-Wow, really?

09:07.916 --> 09:09.750
And I really like it when you dance.

09:10.791 --> 09:12.250
That's great.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.875
And I like

09:13.958 --> 09:15.500
your exit strategy,

09:15.583 --> 09:18.791
when what you really wanted
was to feel me up in the photo booth.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.041
-I like that you always make me laugh.
-Always? .

09:25.541 --> 09:27.375
Sometimes I try but it doesn't work.

09:28.375 --> 09:29.708
Okay, almost always.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.500
I really like your kisses.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.375
And I like yours.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.875
I really like the woman you've become.

09:46.541 --> 09:48.333
You do everything you set your mind to.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.666
And you always will.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.000
Oh!

10:19.083 --> 10:21.125
Are you running away from your own party?

10:23.291 --> 10:24.166
You know me.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.458
Everything's going to be fine. You'll see.

10:32.750 --> 10:33.583
I know.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.291
Hello ma'am. Very cheap.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.541
Beautiful skirt.

12:23.416 --> 12:25.333
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
