WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:04.572
Tonight the Scranton Business
Park is having Casino Night.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.474
And we are converting
our warehouse

00:06.507 --> 00:08.042
into a full-blown
gambling hall.

00:08.076 --> 00:11.212
And I know it's illegal
in Pennsylvania.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.780
But it's for charity.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.749
And I consider myself
a great philanderer.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.818
It's just nice to know
at the end of the day

00:17.851 --> 00:19.520
I can look in the mirror
and say,

00:19.553 --> 00:21.622
"Michael, because of you,

00:21.655 --> 00:23.557
"some little kid in the Congo

00:23.591 --> 00:26.327
has a bellyful of rice
this evening."

00:26.360 --> 00:29.463
Just...makes you feel good.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.768
Ahem.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.407
Excuse me.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.110
How long is the wait
for a table for two?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.778
I would never, ever
serve you.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.681
Not in a million,
billion years.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.283
It's a nice tux.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.685
I know. It belonged
to my grandfather.

00:51.719 --> 00:56.124
He was buried in it,
so...family heirloom.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.827
So what's the deal?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.229
We've gotta pay
for our own drinks?

01:01.262 --> 01:02.763
That's lame.
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.199
And besides,
I'm a roulette expert.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.435
Impossible.
Roulette is not a game of skill.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.170
It is a game of chance.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.372
I can always kind
of win at roulette.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.740
Oh, really?
Mm

01:12.773 --> 01:14.442
How would you do that?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.777
Mind control.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.846
You can't be serious.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.849
Are you serious?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.717
Ever since I was little kid,

01:23.751 --> 01:25.553
like eight or nine,

01:25.586 --> 01:28.389
I could sort of control
things with my mind.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.791
I don't believe you.
Continue.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.460
It was just
little things, you know.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.661
Like I could make
something shake.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.363
Or I could make a marble
fall off the counter.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.765
You know,
just little things.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.434
Heh!
That's ridiculous.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.570
You know what? Uh...

01:42.603 --> 01:45.373
Why don't you move
that coat rack?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.740
Excuse me, everyone!

01:46.774 --> 01:48.509
Attention
in the office, please.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.779
Jim is about to prove
his telekinetic powers.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.747
And he needs
absolute silence.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.715
Go ahead.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.518
Okay. I'll try.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.880
Oh, my God.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.689
I try not to think of it
as lagging behind.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.359
It's more of a David
and Goliath thing.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.826
the matter is, of

03:12.860 --> 03:14.528
that your branch is
currently number four

03:14.562 --> 03:16.297
of the five branches
that I oversee.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.332
Top 80%.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.633
Michael...
Yep?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.669
You know that
I'm very serious here.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.672
Jan, listen. I promise I will
kick it up a notch.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.839
Bam!

03:25.873 --> 03:27.408
What?

03:27.441 --> 03:30.444
Emeril. Oh, actually,
while I have you--

03:30.478 --> 03:32.646
Not that I have you
or have ever had you.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.715
But we're having
our Casino Night tonight,

03:34.748 --> 03:36.650
and I think everyone
would love to see

03:36.684 --> 03:37.718
their fearless leader here.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.521
I thought that you were
their fearless leader.

03:40.554 --> 03:45.826
I am, but you are my Eva Perón
to my César Chévez.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.530
I, um, think you can
handle it probably, Michael.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.766
Oh, come on, come on!
It'd be fun.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.602
I can hear it
in your voice.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.870
You need a break.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.539
Goodbye, Michael.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.675
Jan and I understand
each other.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.844
The romance thing is sort of
on hold for the time being.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.846
But we've remained
good friends.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.881
Good friends with privileges.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.851
Not now.
Someday.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.287
Okay, everybody.
Tonight's event

04:13.321 --> 04:15.423
is to benefit
the Boy Scouts of America.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.758
Again.
We do that every year.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.759
Well, they need our money.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.561
They don't have cookies
like the Girl Scouts.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.530
It'd be nice to do
something for people

04:22.563 --> 04:23.664
who are actually suffering.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.666
Well, Oscar,
if you don't like it,

04:25.699 --> 04:27.968
then you should
concentrate on winning.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.904
Because the person
at the end of the evening

04:30.938 --> 04:34.575
with the highest chip count
will receive $500

04:34.608 --> 04:36.844
to donate to the charity
of their choice.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.012
And they will get
a mini fridge

04:39.046 --> 04:40.614
compliments of
Vance Refrigeration.

04:40.648 --> 04:43.484
So, get your charities
into Pam.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.053
I, for example, am playing
for Comic Relief.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.721
That doesn't exist anymore.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.592
Comedy's very much alive,
as are homeless people.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.861
No, they stopped
making that show.

04:53.894 --> 04:57.398
Well, then they need
our money more than ever.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.567
You have to pick an approved
nonprofit organization.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.702
There's a great soup kitchen
in downtown Scranton.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.071
Delicious pea soup
on Thursdays.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.906
I'll probably give
the money to them.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.942
Something with animals.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.744
Or people.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.348
Kobe Bryant has a foundation,
and he is so hot.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.585
And he gave his wife
the biggest diamond ring.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.086
I know he didn't do it.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.790
Maybe he did it.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.126
We are giving money
that has been gambled.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.629
Why don't we just deal drugs
or prostitute ourselves

05:28.662 --> 05:30.564
and donate that money
to charity?

05:30.598 --> 05:33.734
Oh, and another fun thing.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.835
We, at the end
of the night,

05:34.868 --> 05:36.737
are going to
give the check

05:36.770 --> 05:38.839
to an actual group
of Boy Scouts.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.741
Right, Toby?
We're gonna--

05:40.774 --> 05:41.742
Actually, I didn't think
it was appropriate

05:41.775 --> 05:44.612
to invite children
since it's--

05:44.645 --> 05:47.047
You know, there's gambling
and alcohol.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.582
And it's
in our dangerous warehouse.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.519
And it's a school night.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.754
And, you know,
Hooters is catering.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.391
Is that enough?
Should I keep going?

06:00.494 --> 06:02.630
Why are you the way
that you are?

06:02.663 --> 06:05.499
Honestly, every time I try
to do something fun

06:05.533 --> 06:06.634
or exciting,

06:06.667 --> 06:10.471
you make it not that way.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.807
I hate so much

06:13.841 --> 06:18.512
about the things
that you choose to be.

06:18.546 --> 06:19.613
Okay, you know what?

06:19.647 --> 06:22.650
I will not donate
my winnings

06:22.683 --> 06:25.686
to Comic Relief since
apparently it doesn't exist.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.990
I am going to donate to
Afghanistanis with AIDS.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.759
I think you mean
the Aid to Afghanistan.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.695
No, I mean Afghanistanis
with AIDS.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.664
Afghani.
What?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.832
Afghani.
That's a dog.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.000
No, that's Afghan.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.669
That's a shawl.

06:41.702 --> 06:42.536
Wait. Canine AIDS?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.538
No, humans with AIDS.
Who has AIDS?

06:44.572 --> 06:47.475
Guys, the Afghanistananis.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.577
You know what?
No. No.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.745
AIDS is not funny.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.647
Believe me.
I have tried.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.784
There are certain topics that
are off-limits to comedians.

06:56.817 --> 07:00.554
JFK. AIDS.
The Holocaust.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.557
The Lincoln assassination
just recently became funny.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.627
"I need to see this play like
I need a hole in the head."

07:08.161 --> 07:10.698
And I hope to someday
live in a world

07:10.731 --> 07:13.867
where a person could tell
a hilarious AIDS joke.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.703
It's one of my dreams.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.471
What are you doing?

07:17.505 --> 07:20.474
Oh, nothing.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.511
"Till Death Do Us Rock."

07:23.544 --> 07:24.878
They're wedding bands.
Oh.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.213
Roy was supposed to
pick the band,

07:26.246 --> 07:29.650
but he's concentrating more
on the bachelor party now.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.784
Wait, wait,
where are you going?

07:30.818 --> 07:32.185
I mean, even if you don't
hire a band,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.722
you still have to
watch the bands.

07:34.755 --> 07:38.526
Pam, these are people who have
never given up on their dreams.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.161
I have great
respect for that.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.163
And yes, they're all
probably very bad.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.565
And that'll make me
feel better

07:44.598 --> 07:46.634
about not having dreams.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.636
There's a KISS
cover band in here.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
Let's do it.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.673
I'm pretty happy these days.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.542
I'm getting married soon,

07:54.575 --> 07:58.512
and I'm getting along
with everybody at work.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.815
Why did I talk to Jan
about transferring?

08:01.849 --> 08:04.752
Well, you know...

08:04.785 --> 08:08.622
I have no future here.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.992
I have already put down
the deposit.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.595
Do you understand
how a deposit works?

08:14.628 --> 08:17.631
Mike, I am not having fire
eaters in a paper warehouse.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.132
It's Casino Night.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.268
Like Las Vegas. There are
fire eaters all over the place.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.703
Except my warehouse.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.937
Actually, it's my warehouse.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.540
Actually, it's owned
by Beekman Properties,

08:26.574 --> 08:28.642
and Dunder Mifflin is four
years into a seven-year lease.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.679
Why are you here?

08:31.712 --> 08:32.813
When Darryl was coming,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.081
you said you wanted me
here for protection.

08:34.114 --> 08:38.819
N-N-- I said not that.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.954
We just have a lot
of stuff down there

08:40.988 --> 08:42.222
that could be stolen.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.224
That's ironic.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.258
What?

08:45.292 --> 08:47.561
That you are afraid.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.563
Why? 'Cause
I'm from the hood?

08:49.597 --> 08:51.599
Dinkin flicka.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.002
Dinkin flicka.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.271
I taught Mike some phrases

08:58.305 --> 09:01.141
to help with his
interracial conversations.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.611
You know, stuff like
"fleece it out,"

09:03.644 --> 09:07.080
"gormac five,
"dinkin flicka."

09:07.114 --> 09:09.683
You know,
things us Negroes say.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.585
Give me some.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.255
Oot!
Oot!

09:15.288 --> 09:18.325
Oh, yeah. I taught him
a handshake, too.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.916
Wow. I don't know
how you're gonna decide.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.852
They are all
extremely good.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.086
I think I should
hire them all.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.622
Do like Lollapalooza.
Have three stages, yeah.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
Your mom would love that.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.292
She would.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.195
Now this band is
called Scrantonicity.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.231
Let's take a look.
Nice.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.868
Oh, wait.
That's Kevin.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.736
On the drums.
What?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.972
On the drums!
Oh, my God!
That's Kevin.

10:05.005 --> 10:08.208
Great song, Kev.

10:08.241 --> 10:12.279
Oh, my God. He's the drummer
and the singer.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.182
We really don't do
a lot of weddings.

10:15.215 --> 10:19.119
We actually don't play
in public very often.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.356
We're all really hoping
that Pam's wedding works out.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.894
This could be a turning point
for the band.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.328
Wow. Oh!

10:28.361 --> 10:32.199
Yeah, you haven't seen
that since 1983.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.867
That is amazing.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.436
Okay, we have to sign him.
I'm gonna call the label--

10:36.469 --> 10:38.806
No, no, no!
Come back!

10:38.839 --> 10:40.240
Hey, you're gonna lose him
to another wedding. Kev!

10:40.273 --> 10:42.175
Jim is great.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.077
Being with him
just takes away

10:44.111 --> 10:46.313
all the stress
of planning my wedding.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.116
Yes?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.751
Michael,
Carol Stills for you.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.687
Who?
Carol Stills.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.055
Do I know
a Carol Stills?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.189
Your realtor.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.925
Oh, yeah,
put her through.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.861
Hey, Carol, how goes
the real estate biz?

11:00.894 --> 11:02.763
Is it real good?

11:02.796 --> 11:03.864
Still me.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.265
Sometimes I don't put
Michael through

11:05.298 --> 11:07.167
until he's already
said something.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.237
I look at it as
a practice run for him.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.773
He usually does better
on the second attempt.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.407
Carol, you're on
with Michael.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.776
Hello, Michael.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.477
Hi, Carol.
how you doing?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.913
I'm great. I just needed
one last signature

11:19.947 --> 11:21.148
for your mortgage insurance.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.183
Oh, hey,
no problemo.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.417
Incidentally,
I love the place.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.019
Oh, great.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.254
Has a little bit
of a weird smell.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.289
It's okay. At Christmas,
the tree helped.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.291
Oh, good.
I'm glad.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.360
Um, can I drop it
over later?

11:33.393 --> 11:37.297
Actually, I'm sort of
hosting this charity thing

11:37.330 --> 11:39.099
in our warehouse.
Casino Night.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.400
Oh, great.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.969
Yeah, it'll be good.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.171
You know what?
Why don't you come by?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.006
Bring the papers.
I'll sign 'em.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.141
And then you can stay
and have a drink.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.309
To the casino thing?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.311
Yeah, it'll be fun.
What do you--

11:53.246 --> 11:54.915
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can you hold on?

11:54.948 --> 11:57.184
Michael, Jan's on line two.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.853
Okay.
Put her through.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.256
Jan Levinson, I presume?

12:03.290 --> 12:07.527
It's still me.
Jan, here's Michael.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.796
Michael?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.097
Hey, Jan.
How you doing?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.833
You know, I--I thought
about it,

12:12.866 --> 12:14.802
and you are right.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.069
I am?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.204
I could use a little fun.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.273
So I am going to drive up
for your Casino Night.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.275
Uh--okay.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.912
Incidentally,
what is the charity?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.914
AIDS.

12:26.947 --> 12:30.083
Okay then. I will--
I'll see you tonight.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.152
Okay.
Sounds great.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.822
Bye-bye.
Bye.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.489
Uh, hello, Carol?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.525
Sorry about that.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.127
No problemo.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.030
Right. Um...

12:43.063 --> 12:45.365
To answer your question,
yes.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.101
What?
I'd love to go.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.569
Okay.
I have to get a sitter,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.071
but that shouldn't be
a problem.

12:51.104 --> 12:51.872
Problem. Good.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.874
And I'll bring
the papers too.

12:53.907 --> 12:57.077
Good. All right.
Sounds great.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.012
Well, I'll see you tonight.
Bye.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.180
Bye.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.420
Two queens on Casino Night.

13:07.454 --> 13:11.124
I am going to drop a deuce
on everybody.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.135
Oh, my God!

13:22.169 --> 13:25.839
Mwah!
That's great!

13:25.873 --> 13:28.475
Hey, Carol.
You look great.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.410
Thanks.
Thank you for inviting me.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.879
It looks so great in here.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.313
Well.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.919
That's how we do it
in the paper biz.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.054
It's European.

13:41.088 --> 13:46.159
Michael.
Yes? Ah, Dwight!

13:46.193 --> 13:48.962
Codename Re/Max is here.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.131
No sign of Lan Jevinson.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.901
I'm Michael's wingman.
I've got his back.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.168
Two dates.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.005
He's got two dates tonight.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.240
My job is keep Jan
away from Carol.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.042
And vice versa.

14:02.075 --> 14:06.313
Michael said, "We must deceive
them so as not to hurt them,

14:06.346 --> 14:11.151
and in that way,
we honor them."

14:11.184 --> 14:13.620
Can I get you a drink?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.122
The food is from Hooters.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.290
A drink would be good.
Okay.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.462
Oh, I steal things
all the time.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.431
It's just something I do.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.533
I stopped caring
a long time ago.

14:26.566 --> 14:30.170
You should see how many supplies
I've taken from this place.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.240
Honestly, I love
stealing things.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.175
I'm gonna get a drink.
Do you need anything?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.077
No, I'm fine.
Thanks, sweetheart.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.917
Billy, your nurse is hot.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.585
That's my girlfriend.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.655
Your nurse became
your girlfriend. Sweet.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.257
She was never my nurse.
I met her at Chili's.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.424
She was my waitress.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.595
Chili's is great.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.272
Willkommen. Bienvenue.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.608
And welcome to Monte Carlo.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.979
Dwight.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.614
I am no longer your boss.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.050
Lady Fortune is your boss.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.019
Will Lady Fortune
give me a raise?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.054
Shut it, shut it.

15:21.088 --> 15:21.854
Will Lady Fortune
be your mistress?

15:21.888 --> 15:26.994
Only time will tell,
my friends.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.297
Leave all your preconceived
notions about casinos

15:30.330 --> 15:32.099
at the door.

15:32.132 --> 15:36.303
Old friends.
New lovers.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.140
And the disabled.
Welcome all!

15:40.173 --> 15:42.009
Great. Okay.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.576
Shuffle up and deal.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.445
Let's get it started.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.714
Black-eyed crows.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.983
Okay, the game is no-limit
Texas Hold 'Em.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.085
Good luck, everybody.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.191
That's at least
four red chips to you, sir.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.264
All in.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.665
Oh!

16:05.698 --> 16:06.733
Bluffing is
a key part of poker,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.535
which is too bad,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.704
because I am not
very good at bluffing.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.374
Did you believe me?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.110
I'll call.

16:17.144 --> 16:21.048
What are--
That's insane.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.749
I have good cards.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.352
Well, Toby, I went
all in on the first hand,

16:25.385 --> 16:28.121
so doesn't that tell you that
I might have good cards too?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.223
So don't be stupid.
Just take it back.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.558
I'm sorry. He can't, sir.
He's gone all in.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.559
Okay,
all right, whatever.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.096
Flip 'em.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.368
You really screwed
that up.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.203
Way to go, Toby.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.737
Wow.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.074
I don't really play cards,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.710
It felt really good to take
money from Michael.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.146
Gonna chase that feeling.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.215
That's the normal
question.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.451
I expect to do
very well tonight.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.221
I have an acute ability
to read people.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.823
Jim for instance
has a huge tell.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.427
When he gets a good hand,
he coughs.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.198
Uh, I will raise.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.340
Thanks.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.710
It's the weirdest thing.
Every time I cough, he folds.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.745
Wow. Bad luck.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.414
Ah, yeah, whatever.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.849
Hey, you know what?
If luck weren't involved,

17:29.882 --> 17:33.120
I would always
be winning.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.855
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.224
Michael.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.226
Jan.
Hi.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.861
Look, okay.
I think we're all adults here.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.097
And it has always been
my understanding

17:44.131 --> 17:46.366
that we have
an open relationship.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.401
What are--Wait.
What are you talking about?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.303
What does that mean?

17:50.337 --> 17:52.772
After you said
you weren't coming,

17:52.805 --> 17:54.607
I invited Carol to come.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.743
And I don't think that
I did anything wrong.

17:56.776 --> 18:00.280
No.
No, you didn't.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.781
Hi, I'm Jan.
I'm Michael's boss.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.183
Hi.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.252
Does anyone
want a drink?

18:05.285 --> 18:06.586
No, I'm good.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.121
Okay.

18:10.323 --> 18:14.661
Heh. Um...

18:14.694 --> 18:16.829
Hey, hey.
Hey

18:16.863 --> 18:18.198
Jan's here.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.636
Give me the dice.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.706
Come on, Dwight.
It's on you, baby.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.675
Good evening, Dwight.
What is this?

18:28.708 --> 18:31.311
Evening, Angela.
This is craps.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.147
I need to roll an eight.
If I do, everyone wins.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.815
Then roll an eight.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.350
Thank you, Angela.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.253
Good luck, Dwight.

18:40.287 --> 18:44.757
Yeah! Yeah! Mwah!

18:44.791 --> 18:46.559
That's good stuff.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.861
Dwight, let's keep it going.
Let's keep it going.

18:48.895 --> 18:49.929
Let it ride.
Let it all ride.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.198
Give me the dice!

18:59.639 --> 19:01.608
Yeah, right.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.675
"Yeah, right," what?

19:02.709 --> 19:04.344
What was this?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.746
I have good cards.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.681
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.784
And I'm gonna
take you all in.
Wow.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.287
I think
you're bluffing.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.367
Yeah, I think
she's full of it.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.606
Straight.
Oh.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.408
Three nines.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.810
Jim Halpert,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.779
Thank you very much.
It was fun.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.551
Cosmopolitan, please.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.253
Can I get a red wine?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.757
So, uh, so two hours.
That's a long drive.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.492
Well, it's part
of the job.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.461
You know, keep an eye
on things.

19:54.494 --> 19:58.498
So...why not?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.639
So how long have
you and Michael been, um--

20:06.673 --> 20:09.442
Oh, uh, well, actually,

20:09.476 --> 20:13.446
I guess this would be
our first date, I guess.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.315
Casino Night
in the warehouse.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.716
Good sport.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.285
Well, I'm having
a nice time.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.321
Oh, me too.
Me too.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.630
One beer,
and one 7 and 7

20:30.663 --> 20:31.898
with eight
Maraschino cherries,

20:31.931 --> 20:35.568
sugar on the rim,
blended if you can.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.936
So that's still
going on, huh?

20:36.969 --> 20:41.274
You and Kelly?

20:41.308 --> 20:42.575
All right!

20:42.609 --> 20:44.344
Point is four.
Shooter roll a four.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.447
Come on, shooter!

20:47.480 --> 20:48.781
Blow!
Blow for luck.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.683
Yeah!

20:50.717 --> 20:53.653
Also you.
Not playing favorites.

20:53.686 --> 20:57.290
All right, here we go.
Yeah!

20:57.324 --> 20:59.592
Five.
Aw, so close, so close.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.494
Come on.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.330
So, where are you
staying, Radisson?

21:03.363 --> 21:06.433
What?
Super 8
Best Western.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.968
I didn't--
Holiday Inn?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.370
The Hyatt
in Wilkes

21:10.403 --> 21:11.604
Are you staying
with Michael?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.606
All right!

21:17.944 --> 21:20.813
I won the 2002 $2,500

21:20.847 --> 21:23.082
No-Limit Deuce to Seven
Draw Tournament

21:23.115 --> 21:25.785
at the World Series
of Poker in Vegas.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.589
So, yeah, I'm pretty good
at poker.

21:32.992 --> 21:33.993
All in.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.728
Okay, let's do it.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.063
Good luck, honey.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.565
Oh, thank you, Bobby,
but it doesn't matter.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.832
It's just fun to play.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.634
Three queens.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.902
Nice, very nice.

21:42.935 --> 21:43.903
I have an Ace.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.873
No, that's a flush.
Oh, man!

21:46.906 --> 21:48.475
I have a flush!
Yes!

21:48.508 --> 21:50.977
Look, I won. Look,
I have all the clovers.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.645
You want to play again?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.814
I suck.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.518
She took you down, huh?

21:58.551 --> 22:01.588
I do not want
to talk about it.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.790
Hey, I saw your tape.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.993
Your band, Scrantonicity.
You guys rock.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.428
Yeah?

22:08.461 --> 22:10.129
Yeah, you guys want
to play our wedding?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.732
Awesome.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.367
Did Pam say it was okay?

22:14.401 --> 22:17.136
Whatever.
I'm in charge of the music.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.139
Dude, you will
not be sorry.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.675
Sweet.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.711
All right.
All right.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.153
Smoke?

22:34.186 --> 22:37.123
No, thanks.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.892
You having fun?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.928
Fabulous time.

22:45.632 --> 22:49.101
I drove two and a half hours
to get here.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.104
Yeah, we all really--
Left work early,
drove down here.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.575
And I am completely
underdressed.

22:55.608 --> 22:59.646
I think
you look great.

22:59.679 --> 23:04.717
Why did I hook up
with Michael?

23:04.751 --> 23:07.086
Yeah, why did you?

23:07.119 --> 23:13.192
It was very late, Jim.
Very late and, uh...

23:13.225 --> 23:15.628
Have you given any more thought
to the transfer?

23:15.662 --> 23:17.830
Oh, yeah.

23:17.864 --> 23:21.468
Good.
Mm-hmm.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.537
Have you told anyone?

23:24.571 --> 23:27.507
No.
Well, you should.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.649
Uh, excuse me.

23:36.683 --> 23:37.850
Uh, big moment.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.853
The evening's chip leader

23:40.887 --> 23:44.624
and winner of this beautiful
mini refrigerator

23:44.657 --> 23:48.495

Vance Refrigeration,

23:48.528 --> 23:50.963
Creed Bradden,
Dunder-Mifflin.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.605
Thanks. I never owned
a refrigerator.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.877
Sorry, babe.
I'm just beat.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.547
It's okay.
I'll see you at home.
Okay.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.516
Hey, don't try to lose
too much money, all right?

24:09.549 --> 24:11.083
Okay.
In case you still want
a honeymoon.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.489
Hey, Halpert.
Keep an eye on her, all right?

24:16.523 --> 24:18.491
Okay.
Will do.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.593
Bye.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.229
Hey.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.463
Hey, how's it going?
Good.

24:24.497 --> 24:30.670
Especially after
I took all your money in poker.
Ha-ha, yeah.

24:30.703 --> 24:34.073
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

24:34.106 --> 24:35.675
About when you wanna give me
more of your money?

24:35.708 --> 24:37.076
No.
Did you wanna
do that now?

24:37.109 --> 24:39.546
We can go inside.
I'm feeling kinda good tonight.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.148
I was just, um...

24:43.883 --> 24:46.919
I'm in love with you.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.088
What?

24:49.121 --> 24:52.759
I'm really sorry if that's
weird for you to hear,

24:52.792 --> 24:56.062
but I needed you
to...hear it.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.267
Probably not good timing.
I know that, I just--

25:01.300 --> 25:02.902
What are you doing?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.608
What do you expect me
to say to that?

25:10.810 --> 25:13.680
I just needed you
to know.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.181
Once.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.319
Well, I, um--

25:20.352 --> 25:22.622
I...

25:24.323 --> 25:25.558
I can't.

25:25.592 --> 25:28.661
Yeah.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.831
You have no idea...
Don't do that.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.567
what your friendship
means to me.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.704
Come on.
I don't wanna do that.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.773
I wanna be more
than that.

25:40.807 --> 25:44.811
I can't.

25:44.844 --> 25:51.283
I'm really sorry
if you misinterpreted things.

25:53.252 --> 25:56.255
It's probably my fault.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.958
Not your fault.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.762
I'm sorry I misinterpreted
our friendship.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.338
Hey!

26:12.371 --> 26:14.841
I'm leaving.
Hey!
Okay.

26:14.874 --> 26:15.842
So I just wanted
to congratulate you

26:15.875 --> 26:16.876
on a fantastic evening.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.077
Did the company proud.
Thank you.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.646
And, uh, thanks
for inviting me.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.180
You were right.
I needed it, so thanks.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.949
Okay.
Thanks for coming.
Nice to meet you.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.752
And you guys have
a good time together.
Okay.

26:25.785 --> 26:26.953
Talk to you Monday.
Yep.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.322
Bye-bye.
Good night.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.691
She's a good boss.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.959
She seems really nice.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.360
Oh, she's great.

26:34.393 --> 26:37.630
Love triangle drama.

26:37.664 --> 26:38.965
All worked out
in the end though.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.068
The hero got the girl.
Who saw that coming?

26:42.101 --> 26:43.335
I did.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.904
And Jan is really happy
for me.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.906
So actually,
the hero got two girls.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.741
He got the girl
that he works with,

26:48.775 --> 26:53.145
and he got the girl
that he buys real estate from.

26:53.179 --> 26:57.917
So I've got my New York girl
and my local flavor.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.286
Life is good.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.291
About ten minutes ago.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.828
No, I didn't know
what to say.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.397
Yes, I know.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.399
Um, I don't know, Mom.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.002
He's my best friend.

27:17.937 --> 27:22.174
Yeah, he's great.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.444
Yeah, I think I am.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.281
Um, I have to go.
I will.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.251
Listen, Jim.
