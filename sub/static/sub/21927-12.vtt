00:11.220 --> 00:14.384
<i>Power has
always been a deadly narcotic,</i>

00:14.598 --> 00:16.088
<i>and in 1989,</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:19.051
<i>RadioShack's Tandy 1000 SL</i>

00:19.269 --> 00:21.101
<i>was my drug of choice.</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:24.640
<i>With an Intel 8086</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.144
<i>running at eight megahertz</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.602
<i>and a five-and-a-quarter-inch
floppy drive,</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:29.480
<i>there was nothing</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:30.686
<i>I couldn't do.</i>

00:31.406 --> 00:32.692
<i>From adding snazzy graphics</i>

00:32.908 --> 00:34.149
<i>to my homework...</i>

00:34.952 --> 00:36.193
So snazzy.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.657
<i>...to easily alphabetizing</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.706
<i>my list of enemies
and their crimes.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:44.875
So easy.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.412
Sheldon, time to go.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.247
We really need
to get one of these.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.378
What on earth do we need
a computer for?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.550
Yeah, we got you
and your big head.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.377
But we can get

00:54.596 --> 00:55.677
so much accomplished.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.005
I could use
a spreadsheet program

00:57.224 --> 00:58.715
to keep track of your expenses.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.516
I do that in the back
of my checkbook.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.686
Yes, but does your checkbook
go "beep" when you open it?

01:04.063 --> 01:04.849
I don't think so.

01:05.691 --> 01:06.351
<i>Plus, the computer</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:07.899
can organize your recipes.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.726
But my recipes <i>are</i> organized.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.061
On index cards.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.612
Like a cave person.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.735
Cave Mom.
I'm gonna call you that.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.282
It doesn't matter, Sheldon.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.984
We can't afford a computer.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.490
Sure we can. It's only $998,

01:20.706 --> 01:22.914
and Dave says we can buy it
on easy monthly payments.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.115
That's true.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.245
Stay out of this, Dave.

01:25.961 --> 01:26.576
Come on.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.535
We got to get home.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.335
But...

01:28.547 --> 01:29.913
Sheldon, I said no.

01:30.132 --> 01:30.918
I can make you a good deal

01:31.133 --> 01:31.919
<i>on the floor model,</i>

01:32.134 --> 01:32.965
Mrs. Cooper.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.883
Seriously, Dave,
you're getting on my nerves.

01:36.013 --> 01:36.924
It's not fair.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.675
You bought Missy a Ring Pop.

01:38.974 --> 01:39.964
For ten cents.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.425
- And I'm worth every penny.
- Let's go.

01:43.186 --> 01:43.846
Sorry, Dave.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.428
We're living
paycheck to paycheck.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.600
Move!

02:10.172 --> 02:11.959
- Ah, RadioShack.
- Ah, RadioShack.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.131
<i>Here it is, the Tandy 1000 SL
computer system.</i>

02:14.343 --> 02:17.381
Sheldon was going on and on
about that thing today.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.303
<i>I've never seen one
so easy to use.</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:21.597
<i>Greetings. Need
directions back to your planet?</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:23.470
<i>This technology is more advanced
than we thought.</i>

02:23.685 --> 02:24.846
<i>You know that movie</i> E.T.?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.057
The kid who finds him,
his name is Elliott,

02:27.272 --> 02:29.514
which starts with an "E"
and ends with a "T."

02:29.816 --> 02:30.852
Coincidence?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.434
I don't think so.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.652
You're gonna live
with us forever, aren't you?

02:35.364 --> 02:37.447
So, Sheldon wants
a computer?

02:37.699 --> 02:38.564
Ever since he could talk.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.991
But now more than ever.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.693
Well, he should get a job
after school.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.823
Save up and buy one.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.700
Get a job? He's nine.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.996
I mowed lawns
when I was his age.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.164
Made pretty good money.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.242
You want Sheldon to mow lawns?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.085
He's so pale,
five minutes in the sun,

02:51.296 --> 02:52.787
he'd burst into flames.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.292
I would pay to see that.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.373
Shut up, Georgie.

02:55.967 --> 02:56.582
<i>I hope you told him</i>

02:56.802 --> 02:57.588
we can't afford it.

02:57.803 --> 02:58.839
Of course.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.503
I could buy it for him,

03:00.722 --> 03:02.554
and then y'all could pay
me back when you can.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.508
Okay, Connie, now you're
just insulting me.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.343
Well, that was not my intention,

03:07.562 --> 03:09.144
but I'm glad to hear it.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.596
I can pay my own bills

03:10.816 --> 03:11.852
and take care of my family.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.184
There are expenses
we could cut back on

03:14.403 --> 03:15.860
so we could afford a computer.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.607
You mean like the money
you give to church?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.738
No, I mean like
the money you give

03:19.950 --> 03:21.486
to the Lone Star Beer company.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.863
Good one, Mom.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.034
- Shut up.
- Shut up, pumpkin. - Shut up.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.236
We're not getting a computer.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.196
We don't need your money.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.323
Where are you going?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.084
To get a... glass of milk.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.752
He's lying. He's getting a beer.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.125
Shut up, Georgie.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.971
Mom?

03:44.975 --> 03:46.557
Why are you still up?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.552
Madame Curie is on the roof,

03:49.771 --> 03:52.764
and she's not wearing her hat.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.269
You're just dreaming, baby.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.734
But she'll be cold
without her hat.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.903
I'll give her mine.
Now you go to sleep.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.648
Mm, thanks, Mom.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.233
You're the best.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.449
<i>Oh, Lord.</i>

04:22.596 --> 04:24.758
I'm guessing we're not having
our once-a-week.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.425
Sorry, I only have relations
with gentlemen I like.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.435
Oh, come on. You know how I feel

04:31.646 --> 04:33.478
about your mother meddlin'
in our finances.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.977
She wasn't meddlin',
she was offering to help.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.059
And that computer
is not some silly toy.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.065
Sheldon could use it
for his schoolwork,

04:40.280 --> 04:43.114
and I could use it to...
organize my recipes.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.112
You already got 'em organized
on those little cards.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.488
Yeah, like a cave person.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.740
Well, it doesn't matter.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.662
We can't afford it,
end of story.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.165
Not exactly end of story.

04:53.877 --> 04:54.583
What's that mean?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.627
I've been setting money aside
the last couple of years,

04:56.838 --> 04:58.420
and this might be a good use
for it.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.665
Money from what?

05:00.884 --> 05:02.466
You know, here and there.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.173
Bookkeeping for the church,

05:05.388 --> 05:06.378
some seamstress work,

05:06.598 --> 05:08.510
birthday money
from my Aunt Zelda.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.341
And just how much
of this "here and there" money

05:10.560 --> 05:11.641
you got saved up?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.469
Well, seeing as it's my money,

05:13.688 --> 05:15.145
I don't think
that's any of your business.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.768
None of my business?

05:17.359 --> 05:17.974
You see every nickel

05:18.193 --> 05:19.855
I make,
and you got secret money?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.811
It's not secret.
I just told you.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.650
Where you hiding it?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.323
Well, now you're headed
into secret territory.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.401
Oh, okay.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.779
Just so I'm clear,
my money's our money,

05:30.997 --> 05:32.283
but your money's your money.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.159
That's right.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.287
Oh, good to know.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.335
I'm glad we're not having
our once-a-week

05:38.547 --> 05:40.129
'cause I am not in the mood.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.462
Really?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.134
That's too bad.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.927
Why? Are you?

05:47.305 --> 05:48.216
No!

05:51.184 --> 05:52.391
That was uncalled for.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.981
I forgot to tell you,
a girl called for you.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.024
What girl?

06:04.239 --> 06:05.730
I don't know. A girl.

06:05.949 --> 06:06.905
Well, what'd she say?

06:07.117 --> 06:09.325
It's hard to remember.
This was months ago.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.285
Hey.

06:13.206 --> 06:13.992
Two cases?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.539
You've got to be kidding me.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.161
Don't worry,
I didn't use your money.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.538
I used mine.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.172
Finish your dinner

06:24.384 --> 06:25.215
and then pack a bag.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.634
We are going to Meemaw's.

06:27.178 --> 06:27.793
Why?

06:28.013 --> 06:30.255
Because your mom and dad
need a break from each other.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.305
For how long?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.304
I don't know. Just pack.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.059
Will I need earmuffs?

06:36.271 --> 06:37.603
Sure, if you want.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.557
Although my almanac
does predict mild temperatures.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.891
Then don't bring it.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.859
I'll just bring my almanac.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.356
You know what, I'll bring both.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.322
Should I pack my toothbrush

06:48.533 --> 06:50.650
or use the one
I keep at Meemaw's?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.030
I got this one.

06:52.621 --> 06:53.782
Nobody cares.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.075
I don't want
to go to Meemaw's house.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.577
What if that girl calls back?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.283
Fine, then stay here
with your father.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.664
Sheldon and Missy, we are out
of here in half an hour.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.624
Not a lot of time
to pick a toothbrush.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.221
Come on in.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.101
Mom and Dad need a break.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.603
We don't know how long.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.027
What's he got in there?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.445
Everything.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.782
<i>First and ten in the
closing minutes of the fourth quarter...</i>

07:35.997 --> 07:37.704
I ain't never
getting married.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.408
- That so?
- Yeah.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.335
Women are nothing but trouble.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.457
I'll get it!

07:46.549 --> 07:48.256
Hello, Georgie speaking.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.676
Did you run to the phone?
Do you feel stupid?

07:53.556 --> 07:54.592
Who was it?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.091
Nobody.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.175
This little tiff

07:58.395 --> 07:59.602
between your mom and me
will blow over.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.020
Don't make a big deal of it.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.472
I'm not. I'm just saying

08:02.691 --> 08:04.227
I'm better suited
to the single life.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.975
And how do you picture that?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.106
Okay, well, you know the buffet
at Golden Corral,

08:08.321 --> 08:09.277
where there's all kinds
of choices

08:09.489 --> 08:10.946
and you can have
as much as you want?

08:11.157 --> 08:11.817
Yeah.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.525
It'll be like that,
only with hot girls.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.362
Georgie, I'll bet you
a thousand dollars

08:17.580 --> 08:19.321
you're married before you're 25.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.448
You got a bet.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.167
I feel like
I'm stealing your money.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.420
<i>Georgie married
his first wife at 19.</i>

08:30.927 --> 08:32.793
<i>He never paid my father.</i>

08:33.346 --> 08:36.089
Well, I got to tell you
how happy I am

08:36.307 --> 08:38.924
that y'all are spending
the night with me.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.260
Your house smells
like cigarettes.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.309
So happy.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.933
Sheldon, we've
talked about this.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.357
You don't need to announce
to people how things smell.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.228
Hmm.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.817
All right, you two, settle in.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.146
Are you and Dad
gonna get a divorce?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.650
Of course not.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.448
Are you sure?
Packing up your kids

08:54.659 --> 08:56.400
in the middle of the night
and moving in with your mom

08:56.619 --> 08:58.576
has all the earmarks
of a divorce.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.495
We're not getting a divorce.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.073
Okay, go to sleep.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.703
Sweet dreams.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.049
I can't believe Mom and Dad
had a fight over beer.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.421
I don't think
the fight was about beer.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.302
I think there was
more subtext.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.387
You're probably right.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.387
Then again,
I don't know what subtext is.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.645
I don't want to get
in your business,

09:29.861 --> 09:31.318
but since you're
getting in my bed,

09:31.529 --> 09:33.737
- I'm getting in your business.
- Go ahead.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.564
When you leaving?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.366
Very funny.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.034
That wasn't a joke.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.986
I love you, and
I love the kids,

09:41.206 --> 09:43.072
but I love you better
living across the street.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.079
Sorry the end of my marriage
is inconveniencing you.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.535
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.710
It's a little spat.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.005
No, this was
a long time coming.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.004
This goes to the very core
of our relationship.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.880
I see we're sticking
with dramatic.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.713
The minute he found out
I had money set aside,

09:58.932 --> 10:00.423
he felt threatened.
And you know why?

10:00.642 --> 10:02.884
'Cause it meant that I can
live independent of him.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.719
Sleeping in your
mommy's bed?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.395
You know what I mean.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.478
You gonna buy Sheldon
that computer?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.685
Well, now I have to.

10:12.904 --> 10:13.735
Got it.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.791
You do know I still have
an active love life.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.242
Just go to sleep.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.166
On this very bed.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.422
Oh, Mom.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.300
What's for breakfast?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.135
I don't know. Grab
a bowl of cereal.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.095
Mom usually makes us
eggs and toast

10:48.314 --> 10:49.475
and the occasional meat.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.102
Well, Mom isn't here, is she?

10:51.609 --> 10:54.977
Whoa. Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.445
And you had a choice
'cause you had the whole bed.

10:57.699 --> 10:58.359
Georgie.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.282
Walking on thin ice.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.785
Maybe you should go across
the street and apologize.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.366
I can't do that.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.655
Why not?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.828
'Cause if I do,
it sets a bad precedent.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.784
What's Nixon got to do with it?

11:11.296 --> 11:11.956
What?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.755
You said "bad president,"
like Nixon.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.798
You know, this guy.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.091
You going to apologize?

11:23.850 --> 11:24.636
<i>Dad!</i>

11:25.185 --> 11:25.925
Dad!

11:27.187 --> 11:29.645
If you are, bring back meat!

11:38.573 --> 11:39.279
<i>Hey.</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:41.357
I hope you're happy.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.905
Thank you, Georgie.
That's very kind.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.531
Mom and Dad are fighting
because you want

11:45.747 --> 11:47.158
to get a stupid computer.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.077
What are you talking about?

11:49.292 --> 11:50.408
Mom wanted
to buy it for you,

11:50.627 --> 11:51.492
Dad said they couldn't
afford it,

11:51.711 --> 11:52.747
Meemaw offered
to pay for it,

11:52.962 --> 11:54.703
and now I'm eating
pineapple spears for lunch.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.963
I hate making
my own lunch.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.715
I'm sorry, Georgie,
I didn't know.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.463
Yeah, well, now you do.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.668
What did you get?

12:01.888 --> 12:04.175
A turkey sandwich Mom cut
in the shape of a heart,

12:04.390 --> 12:05.631
a fruit cup, a brownie,

12:05.850 --> 12:08.092
and a note from Meemaw saying
how much she loves me.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.516
I haven't read it yet,
but I bet it's a lot.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.814
I don't even have
a can opener.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.187
Oh, Sugar Apple,
I love you so much.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.148
Your affection for
inanimate objects frightens me.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.824
I'm glad you're happy, Missy.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.574
I'm even happier that I got
a toy, and Sheldon got nothin'.

12:27.872 --> 12:28.988
<i>Well, now,
we're not exactly</i>

12:29.207 --> 12:30.243
done shopping.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.825
Sheldon, you still want
that computer?

12:33.670 --> 12:34.956
I thought we couldn't
afford it.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.412
Don't you worry about that.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.042
Do you want it or not?

12:38.591 --> 12:39.752
More than anything.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.335
All right, then,
let's go get it.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.134
Wait. He gets a computer
and I get a lousy toy?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.715
I thought you liked it.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.015
Not anymore.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.973
Where's the water come out of?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.855
Well, seeing as that's
the dryer, nowhere.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.185
Hmm.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.900
So this one's the washer?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.232
No foolin' you.

13:04.993 --> 13:05.733
What are you doing?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.944
Separating the whites
from the colors.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.698
Whoa, that's racist.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.577
How did I get a rocket scientist
for one son

13:12.792 --> 13:14.909
- and a rodeo clown for the other? <i>
- Oh, man.</i>

13:15.128 --> 13:17.620
I'd give anything
to be a rodeo clown.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.083
<i>They make
people happy,</i>

13:19.299 --> 13:21.291
and they see the rodeo for free.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.585
Mmm.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.726
<i>The home computer
I had long coveted</i>

13:32.937 --> 13:35.020
<i>was finally in my possession,</i>

13:35.732 --> 13:38.566
<i>but it was also destroying
my home.</i>

13:39.444 --> 13:41.310
<i>Thankfully, it came pre-loaded</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:44.067
<i>with a program to help solve
personal problems.</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:46.941
<i>Hello, I am Eliza.</i>

13:47.744 --> 13:50.327
My... parents...

13:51.080 --> 13:54.039
are... fighting...

13:54.250 --> 13:55.832
a lot.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.502
I see.
Can you elaborate on that?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.751
My mother...

14:02.342 --> 14:05.460
bought... me...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.214
this...

14:07.597 --> 14:09.964
computer...

14:11.184 --> 14:12.174
but...

14:12.393 --> 14:17.479
my dad... says... we can't...

14:17.690 --> 14:20.228
<i>afford it.</i>

14:21.527 --> 14:23.735
<i>Do you have issues
with your mother?</i>

14:23.946 --> 14:26.359
Mmm...
No.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.692
<i>She... makes me...</i>

14:29.911 --> 14:32.028
<i>spaghetti...</i>

14:32.246 --> 14:34.909
with hot dogs...

14:35.124 --> 14:37.036
<i>cut up in it.</i>

14:37.835 --> 14:39.792
<i>Can you elaborate on that?</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:43.292
<i>Are you...</i>

14:43.508 --> 14:45.841
going to help me or not?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.512
<i>Hello, I am Eliza.</i>

14:52.433 --> 14:54.470
The future might be overrated.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.137
Okay, water's
definitely on.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.346
Try it now.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.022
We want delicate
or regular?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.521
It doesn't matter,
just turn it on.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.693
Let's go with
delicate to be safe.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.572
Nothin'.

15:09.784 --> 15:10.740
Damn it.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.659
Wait, I know what to do.

15:13.079 --> 15:13.694
What?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.825
Go across the street
and apologize to Mom.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.456
I got nothin' to apologize for.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.500
You don't have to mean it.
I never do.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.997
Georgie, just mind
your business.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.208
Okay, sorry.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.172
In case you
were wondering,

15:25.383 --> 15:26.544
I didn't mean that.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.084
See how easy it is?

15:31.180 --> 15:32.716
These home computers
are amazing.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.423
I could start a real
bookkeeping business

15:34.642 --> 15:35.883
with that thing.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.843
And that would go a
long way to giving you

15:38.062 --> 15:39.678
the financial independence
you're looking for.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.138
Darn tootin'.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.899
Just for your information,

15:45.528 --> 15:47.235
Sheldon is using the
computer right now

15:47.447 --> 15:49.063
to try and fix your marriage.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.147
Really?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.195
What did it say?

15:52.702 --> 15:53.818
It said...

15:54.787 --> 15:56.574
"Get out of your mother's house."

15:56.789 --> 15:58.075
- Mom.
<i>- I'm serious.</i>

15:58.291 --> 15:59.281
I want a cigarette,
and I'm tired

15:59.500 --> 16:00.786
of hiding behind
the garage.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.618
You think I should apologize
to George?

16:02.837 --> 16:05.295
Well, of course not. That would
set a terrible precedent.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.747
<i>I think you should
go back over there</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:08.252
to pick up some
clothes for the kids

16:08.468 --> 16:09.754
and be all cold
and distant,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.505
so he has to
apologize to you.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.671
Oh, that's not bad.

16:14.098 --> 16:14.963
Do it.

16:15.892 --> 16:16.803
I will.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.259
Why you drinking tea?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.636
Get out.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.744
Oh, hello.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.578
Hey.

16:47.632 --> 16:48.873
Were you coming back, or...?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.167
Just to get some clothes
for the kids.

16:53.137 --> 16:53.968
Oh.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.847
Were you coming to talk to me?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.468
Well... yeah.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.012
I, um...

17:07.984 --> 17:09.442
...wanted to apologize.

17:11.948 --> 17:12.779
Really?

17:18.119 --> 17:19.156
Want to go for a walk?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.328
Talk a little?

17:22.250 --> 17:23.161
Sure.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.081
Hey, kids, come here.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.709
Look at that.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.764
<i>It looks like your mom and dad
are gonna be all right.</i>

17:39.141 --> 17:41.053
Does this mean
we're going home?

17:41.269 --> 17:42.635
It appears so.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.679
I didn't even get to wear
my earmuffs yet.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.603
And this program will allow us
to track our family finances,

17:52.822 --> 17:55.610
create a budget, and
prepare tax documents.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.815
- That's impressive.
- Mmm.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.445
Would you like to know
how much money

17:58.661 --> 18:00.243
you spend on beer annually?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.411
- No.
- I would. -

18:04.083 --> 18:06.200
$936.

18:06.711 --> 18:07.371
George.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.207
If you switched
to Hawaiian Punch,

18:10.423 --> 18:12.380
we could live in a bigger house.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.258
<i>Hello, I am Eliza.</i>

18:16.846 --> 18:18.553
Eliza...

18:19.724 --> 18:24.094
Are... you...

18:25.313 --> 18:26.053
hot?

18:27.565 --> 18:29.431
In your fantasies, am I hot?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.893
Oh... yes.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.024
You realize you're not
talking to a real person.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.356
Hey, get out of here.
I'm about to score.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.448
<i>Missy! Turn off the computer.</i>

18:42.663 --> 18:43.494
<i>Time to go to bed.</i>

18:43.706 --> 18:45.698
I got to finish my homework!

18:47.293 --> 18:48.750
Big money, big money.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.583
Yes!

19:01.599 --> 19:02.806
Hello?

19:05.436 --> 19:06.267
Hello?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.447
Oh.

19:24.955 --> 19:25.615
What?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.242
What? Nothin'.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.418
Button you pull, that's stupid.
