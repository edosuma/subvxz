WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:07.065
You have me at a bit of a
disadvantage, Mr. Griffiths.

00:07.066 --> 00:09.868
Oh, I have you at a total
disadvantage, Ms. Vaughan.

00:10.174 --> 00:11.985
Although I daresay that towel

00:11.986 --> 00:15.016
has never been shown
off to better advantage.

00:17.006 --> 00:18.955
What can I do for you?

00:18.956 --> 00:21.945
As a matter of fact,

00:21.946 --> 00:24.085
you can do exactly as I say.

00:24.086 --> 00:26.025
You see, the Firm has
recently discovered

00:26.026 --> 00:29.975
that our Ben has
been working with the FBI.

00:31.076 --> 00:34.915
Your angelic influence, I assume.

00:34.916 --> 00:37.025
And your mother disapproves?

00:37.026 --> 00:39.025
Oh, you know about my mother, do you?

00:39.026 --> 00:42.005
He has been telling
tales out of school, hasn't he?

00:42.006 --> 00:43.965
Did he also happen to
mention that my sister

00:43.966 --> 00:45.875
has escaped Federal custody,

00:45.876 --> 00:47.895
and is now back with
the Family, as well?

00:47.896 --> 00:49.035
All of which is to say

00:49.036 --> 00:52.065
that you're very lucky it's
me here and not her.

00:52.066 --> 00:53.975
She's no fan of yours.

00:53.976 --> 00:55.945
As you can imagine.

00:55.946 --> 00:58.045
- Yes, well, your sister is...
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:58.046 --> 01:01.055
Before you say anything you'll regret,

01:01.056 --> 01:04.915
please remember she is my sister.

01:04.916 --> 01:09.045
And... she's watching.

01:09.046 --> 01:10.965
They all are.

01:10.966 --> 01:15.875
Say "hello" to Mum, Margot, and Ben.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.926
Or "goodbye," depending
on how Benji plays this.

01:23.026 --> 01:26.895
I trust I can rely on
your full cooperation?

01:26.896 --> 01:28.875
I'll do whatever you want.

01:28.876 --> 01:29.906
Of course you will, dear.

01:30.643 --> 01:32.055
Just tell Rhys to let her go.

01:32.056 --> 01:33.885
She'll be fine.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.935
I promise you. I give you my word.

01:35.936 --> 01:38.945
Oh, but that's the problem, my love.

01:38.946 --> 01:41.055
Your word means nothing to me now.

01:41.056 --> 01:44.975
So, Rhys will take her
somewhere safe until we finish the job.

01:44.976 --> 01:45.985
And then?

01:45.986 --> 01:48.544
And then... we'll see, won't we?

01:48.771 --> 01:50.394
Sybil, if anything happens to her...

01:50.395 --> 01:53.956
Now, now, that all depends on you.

02:18.946 --> 02:21.045
Where is he taking her?

02:21.046 --> 02:25.945
If I knew that, I would go
there and kill her myself.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.025
Margot.

02:27.026 --> 02:30.085
Are you seriously asking
me for help right now?

02:30.086 --> 02:33.045
If you want to see Alice
safe, I would do what she says.

02:33.046 --> 02:34.975
Is that what you were doing,

02:34.976 --> 02:37.035
following orders even
though she rejected you?

02:37.036 --> 02:38.895
She didn't reject me.

02:38.896 --> 02:41.045
She passed me over for a promotion.

02:41.046 --> 02:45.905
And I rashly decided to
strike out on my own with you.

02:45.906 --> 02:49.105
Which proved to be the
biggest mistake of my life.

02:49.106 --> 02:50.945
I am sorry.

02:52.936 --> 02:54.095
Are you?

02:54.096 --> 02:58.095
Alice says that you're
happier than you've ever been,

02:58.096 --> 03:00.045
that you've at last found someone

03:00.046 --> 03:02.086
you can be your true self with.

03:04.106 --> 03:07.885
Well, now Rhys has found her, too.

03:07.886 --> 03:10.085
Now, then,
darlings, should we go?

03:10.086 --> 03:11.915
Where are we going?

03:11.916 --> 03:14.005
Oh, fewer questions, I think, Benji?

03:14.006 --> 03:16.905
The less you know, the
less tempted you'll be

03:16.906 --> 03:18.656
to tell your new friends at the FBI.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.955
Come along.

03:20.956 --> 03:21.945
Is Alice here?

03:21.946 --> 03:22.945
Not yet. Why?

03:22.946 --> 03:24.015
She's not picking up her phone.

03:24.016 --> 03:25.045
What's going on?

03:25.046 --> 03:26.413
Margot Bishop escaped.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.045
What?!

03:27.046 --> 03:28.105
- How?
- Oh, my God.

03:28.106 --> 03:30.065
Someone let her out of holding,

03:30.066 --> 03:31.935
someone with the FBI.

03:31.936 --> 03:33.915
The Firm has people on the inside.

03:33.916 --> 03:34.915
Apparently.

03:34.916 --> 03:37.085
So, now there's no one we can trust.

03:37.086 --> 03:40.935
No. I'm sorry.

03:40.936 --> 03:42.005
Where are you going?

03:42.006 --> 03:43.066
To call Allie.

03:52.036 --> 03:54.076
Try this one.

04:09.936 --> 04:12.106
Leave it. It's fine.

04:14.086 --> 04:15.955
It's the office.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.237
They'll be wondering where I
am, and they'll come looking.

04:21.036 --> 04:22.985
All right. Go ahead. Answer it.

04:22.986 --> 04:24.956
Tell them you won't be coming in today.

04:27.066 --> 04:29.046
And make it convincing.

04:34.026 --> 04:35.045
Hello?

04:35.046 --> 04:36.035
Where are you?

04:36.036 --> 04:37.885
Oh, I'm, uh...

04:37.886 --> 04:40.065
Listen, Dao's here.

04:40.066 --> 04:41.508
Margot escaped.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.895
Oh? How?

04:44.896 --> 04:47.055
The Firm has people in the FBI.

04:47.056 --> 04:48.926
Are you on your way?

04:49.986 --> 04:53.945
I'm, um... I'm actually not
feeling like myself today.

04:53.946 --> 04:55.509
What's wrong? Are you... Are you sick?

04:55.661 --> 04:57.035
I'm fine.

04:57.036 --> 05:00.925
I just may need the
day to get back on my feet.

05:00.926 --> 05:01.935
Okay.

05:01.936 --> 05:03.447
Do you need anything? Can I...

05:03.448 --> 05:04.906
No, I'll call you.

05:06.996 --> 05:08.095
Here.

05:08.096 --> 05:10.055
Put this on.

05:10.056 --> 05:12.035
She's not feeling well.

05:12.036 --> 05:13.386
What do you want to do?

05:13.537 --> 05:15.086
I want to find Margot Bishop.

05:17.096 --> 05:20.965
Impressive, isn't it? All
the latest technology.

05:20.966 --> 05:24.925
Turns out it costs an
actual fortune to make a fake one.

05:24.926 --> 05:27.075
- Hello, Leah, darling.
- Sybil.

05:27.076 --> 05:31.055
Hello, Paul McCartney. How's
my favorite Beatle?

05:32.926 --> 05:33.965
Reggie.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.935
Ben.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.915
Oh, that's right. You didn't know.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.955
Mr. Lennox works for me
now. Don't you, Mr. Lennox?

05:41.956 --> 05:44.895
Turns out he was as surprised

05:44.896 --> 05:46.915
by your alliance with the Bureau

05:46.916 --> 05:48.046
as we were.

05:49.056 --> 05:50.975
So, how's it going?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.579
Right this way. I'll show you.

05:54.379 --> 05:55.935
It's actually comforting to know

05:55.936 --> 05:57.706
I'm not the only friend you betrayed.

05:57.707 --> 05:59.976
- Margot!
- Coming, Mother.

06:06.886 --> 06:08.005
I begged you to stay away.

06:08.006 --> 06:09.075
The FBI?

06:09.076 --> 06:11.075
Dao?

06:11.076 --> 06:12.955
You're a snitch now?

06:12.956 --> 06:15.985
I never told them about you. I swear.

06:15.986 --> 06:18.065
Now Rhys has Alice. Sybil
is using her as leverage.

06:18.066 --> 06:19.895
Do you know where she is?

06:19.896 --> 06:20.985
No, we're not doing this.

06:20.986 --> 06:23.945
I'm not getting myself killed for you

06:23.946 --> 06:25.085
or Alice Vaughan.

06:25.086 --> 06:26.935
And if you're smart...

06:26.936 --> 06:28.895
Reggie, if you know anything, please.

06:28.896 --> 06:31.955
Benjamin!

06:31.956 --> 06:34.955
Take this file number to
the City Planner's office...

06:34.956 --> 06:37.085
without stopping to look for Alice.

06:37.086 --> 06:40.045
Do whatever you need to
do. Be whoever you need to be.

06:40.046 --> 06:42.925
But bring back the
blueprints from that file.

06:42.926 --> 06:45.906
And don't be long about it.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.915
Very nice.

06:52.916 --> 06:55.915
Who is your stylist?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.995
Shall we go and show the
world your new look?

06:57.996 --> 06:59.036
I'll need a bag.

07:00.906 --> 07:02.895
Quite right.

07:02.896 --> 07:05.106
It's not like me to
forget to accessorize.

07:18.096 --> 07:20.015
Well, not that one,

07:20.016 --> 07:22.896
'cause that one doesn't
go with the outfit, does it?

07:26.036 --> 07:27.986
That's the one. Perfect.

07:38.986 --> 07:41.045
Hey, does she need us to
bring her soup or anything?

07:41.046 --> 07:43.025
I could go to Greenblatt's.

07:43.026 --> 07:45.926
When was the last
time she was even sick?

07:46.996 --> 07:48.046
Never.

08:12.648 --> 08:14.561
_

08:15.017 --> 08:17.055
She's still not
answering her phone.

08:17.056 --> 08:18.105
She's probably asleep.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.785
Yes, and when she wakes up,

08:19.786 --> 08:21.005
I will be there to make sure Margot

08:21.006 --> 08:22.905
doesn't come anywhere near her.

08:22.906 --> 08:24.085
- I'm coming with you.
- Me too.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.885
No, I need all of you
guys to stay here...

08:26.886 --> 08:29.246
and figure out how we're gonna catch...

08:32.096 --> 08:34.976
Val... I need your help.

08:39.129 --> 08:40.285
Where is she?

08:40.457 --> 08:42.066
I don't know. That's why I'm here.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.706
Do not lie to me.

08:43.707 --> 08:45.875
The Firm found out that
I've been working with Agent Dao.

08:45.876 --> 08:47.475
Now they have Alice.

08:47.476 --> 08:50.375
- Val.
- I wouldn't.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.395
Danny, we have to find
her. We don't have much time.

08:52.396 --> 08:55.033
You actually think we
believe anything you have to say?

08:55.034 --> 08:57.096
This isn't a con. Alice
is in real danger.

08:57.097 --> 08:58.375
You're gonna tell me where she is.

08:58.376 --> 08:59.425
Val... Whoa.

08:59.426 --> 09:01.415
Valerie, what are you
doing? Put the gun down.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.455
Not until you pick yours
up. He is a criminal.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.306
Danny, get Agent Shawn in here.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.465
Now, where is she?

09:11.466 --> 09:13.365
She's with Rhys.

09:13.366 --> 09:14.535
Where?

09:16.396 --> 09:18.425
People talk about how
horrible Los Angeles is,

09:18.426 --> 09:22.395
but it's really quite
gorgeous, isn't it?

09:22.396 --> 09:25.265
What are we doing here?

09:25.266 --> 09:27.345
I don't know. What do you want to do?

09:27.346 --> 09:31.326
We could go to the Broad,
uh, take the tour of Disney Hall.

09:33.346 --> 09:35.643
Your kidnapping skills need work.

09:35.994 --> 09:38.425
I've never
been very fond of kidnapping.

09:38.426 --> 09:41.275
It's far too tedious.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.485
Here I was thinking you
were a professional.

09:43.486 --> 09:46.345
"Just kill the
victim," that's what I say.

09:46.346 --> 09:48.275
Save everybody time.

09:48.276 --> 09:49.276
Shall we sit?

09:58.316 --> 10:00.425
You're not gonna kill me.

10:00.426 --> 10:02.375
Well, I'd rather not.

10:02.376 --> 10:04.425
It's Benji's life I'm worried about.

10:04.426 --> 10:06.365
What does that mean?

10:06.366 --> 10:09.395
Well, ever since his
unfortunate little tryst with the Feds,

10:09.396 --> 10:12.255
our Benji's had a target on his back,

10:12.256 --> 10:13.829
with my mother taking aim.

10:14.104 --> 10:15.385
And why hasn't she killed him yet?

10:15.386 --> 10:16.465
Because she needs him.

10:16.466 --> 10:19.325
She needs him to pull off one last job.

10:19.326 --> 10:21.305
During which I'm hoping

10:21.306 --> 10:24.315
that he'll fall back into
favor with Mother,

10:24.316 --> 10:26.465
and all will be forgiven.

10:26.466 --> 10:29.305
And what's the job?

10:31.286 --> 10:34.335
That's not important to the story.

10:34.336 --> 10:36.295
For Benji, what really matters

10:36.296 --> 10:39.315
is that it all goes off without a hitch.

10:39.316 --> 10:41.275
Now, in order for that to happen,

10:41.276 --> 10:43.485
you need to stay out of the way.

10:43.486 --> 10:46.335
You do that, and I will ensure
that the two of you

10:46.336 --> 10:48.446
run off and live happily ever after.

10:50.336 --> 10:52.305
Are you offering me a deal?

10:52.306 --> 10:53.465
I'm offering you a choice.

10:53.466 --> 10:58.425
You can either spend the
next 72 hours in a 4x6 cage,

10:58.426 --> 11:02.375
or I can arrange an
ocean-view suite at Shutters,

11:02.376 --> 11:04.385
and you can binge on room service

11:04.386 --> 11:07.305
and abominable American television,

11:07.306 --> 11:08.729
which I kind of quite enjoy.

11:08.889 --> 11:10.355
Mm.

11:10.356 --> 11:13.325
Only if you tell me about the job.

11:15.266 --> 11:18.286
You don't seem to
understand. This is not a negotiation.

11:20.376 --> 11:22.266
I have a gun.

11:24.286 --> 11:25.386
So do I.

11:32.336 --> 11:34.395
Now, where did you get that from?

11:34.396 --> 11:35.445
Hmm-hmm.

11:37.276 --> 11:39.485
You are a clever one, aren't you?

11:39.486 --> 11:43.315
So, the only person here
with a choice is you.

11:43.316 --> 11:45.355
I can pull the
trigger and effectively end

11:45.356 --> 11:48.455
your ability to ever
achieve an erection again,

11:48.456 --> 11:52.375
or you can leave here with the
knowledge that your family

11:52.376 --> 11:54.455
will never be able to bargain with me,

11:54.456 --> 11:57.285
and never be able to make me go away

11:57.286 --> 11:59.425
because I am in control here.

11:59.426 --> 12:00.465
Not you.

12:00.466 --> 12:02.455
Not Ben.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.406
Not anyone else.

12:06.376 --> 12:08.475
So...

12:08.476 --> 12:10.475
what's it gonna be?

12:10.476 --> 12:13.375
Choice is yours.

12:13.376 --> 12:15.416
Wow. I can see why he likes you.

12:17.476 --> 12:19.415
I'll keep my erection, thank you.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.115
You made the right choice.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.435
Oh, you've no idea.

12:24.396 --> 12:25.798
After you?

12:37.306 --> 12:38.857
I swear to God, Christopher...

12:38.858 --> 12:41.211
or whatever you're
calling yourself these days...

12:41.212 --> 12:43.265
Ben. He's Ben now.

12:43.266 --> 12:44.695
'Cause "Ben" is my real name.

12:44.696 --> 12:46.385
If you do not tell me where she is...

12:46.386 --> 12:47.485
We are wasting time.

12:47.486 --> 12:50.132
If I don't return soon, Sybil
will know something is up,

12:50.133 --> 12:51.285
and she will hurt Alice.

12:51.286 --> 12:52.345
What the hell is going on?

12:52.346 --> 12:53.335
Alice!

12:53.336 --> 12:54.465
What are you doing here?

12:54.466 --> 12:56.375
And what's that for?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.325
Where have you been?

12:58.326 --> 13:00.315
What is going on? I was at the house.

13:00.316 --> 13:01.395
Where's Rhys?

13:01.396 --> 13:03.335
He, um... He let me go.

13:03.336 --> 13:04.345
What?

13:04.346 --> 13:06.255
He wanted to make a deal.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.034
He told me if I agreed to
stay away from the wedding,

13:08.035 --> 13:09.285
he'll get us out of here.

13:09.286 --> 13:10.138
Who?

13:10.139 --> 13:11.375
Me and Ben.

13:11.376 --> 13:13.295
Why would he say that?

13:13.296 --> 13:15.275
Because Sybil is planning to kill me.

13:15.276 --> 13:16.345
The minute you finish this job.

13:16.346 --> 13:18.395
He's trying to save your life.

13:18.396 --> 13:21.326
What makes you think that
he's telling the truth?

13:23.316 --> 13:25.406
He let her go, didn't he?

13:34.316 --> 13:36.285
I'm sorry. But I just...

13:36.286 --> 13:40.295
I thought it was gonna be easier,
but seeing him here...

13:40.296 --> 13:43.285
And I know you've forgiven him, but...

13:43.286 --> 13:44.385
I still...

13:47.356 --> 13:49.265
I'm just gonna need some more time.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.376
And I'm clearly not gonna get it.

13:55.446 --> 13:58.345
The Bureau called to
say that I'm off the case,

13:58.346 --> 14:00.405
and they've torn up
Ben's C.I. agreement.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.265
- So no immunity?
- No.

14:02.266 --> 14:04.395
Firm wants me dead, and the
Feds want to put me away.

14:04.396 --> 14:06.345
And the Firm will be
coming after us again, too.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.385
Margot's not gonna forget
you put a gun to her head.

14:08.386 --> 14:10.265
What's our next move? I
got to get back there.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.375
If you can find
out what they're up to...

14:11.376 --> 14:13.265
if we catch them in the act...

14:13.266 --> 14:14.275
But we can't arrest them,

14:14.276 --> 14:15.995
and the Feds are
not on our side anymore.

14:15.996 --> 14:18.395
But we still have LAPD contacts.

14:18.396 --> 14:20.325
What do you say?

14:20.326 --> 14:23.305
What can I say? It's not up to me.

14:23.306 --> 14:24.455
It's up to him now.

14:24.456 --> 14:28.285
Val, I am sorry for everything
I did to you, and to this firm.

14:28.286 --> 14:31.375
And if you want me to,
I will leave right now.

14:31.376 --> 14:33.455
Or I can stay and help.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.396
Whatever you want. It's up to you.

14:39.406 --> 14:41.405
No.

14:41.406 --> 14:44.276
You got us into this, you're
gonna help get us out.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.665
This is Sybil Griffiths,

14:52.666 --> 14:53.755
the mother of Rhys and Margot.

14:53.756 --> 14:55.845
Though Rhys is the
head of the Kensington Firm,

14:55.846 --> 14:58.645
he does everything his
mother tells him to.

14:58.646 --> 15:00.665
We all do exactly as Sybil tells us.

15:00.666 --> 15:04.635
Here are the blueprints, as requested.

15:04.636 --> 15:05.765
In digital form, as well.

15:05.766 --> 15:08.845
Oh, you're slowly working your
way back into my heart,

15:08.846 --> 15:10.675
aren't you, Benjamin?

15:10.676 --> 15:11.825
Anything for Alice Vaughan.

15:11.826 --> 15:13.725
Is she all right?

15:13.726 --> 15:15.795
She'll be fine as long as
you do as you're told.

15:15.796 --> 15:16.785
Right, darling?

15:16.786 --> 15:18.665
Right, Mum.

15:18.666 --> 15:20.765
Allie got the drop on
you with the gun, didn't she?

15:20.766 --> 15:24.765
You seem to have a fondness
for women with concealed weapons.

15:24.766 --> 15:27.715
I'm trying not to read too much into it.

15:27.716 --> 15:28.865
Where did you tell
Sybil you're hiding her?

15:28.866 --> 15:30.785
Someplace so off-putting

15:30.786 --> 15:32.795
even Mum wouldn't
think of looking there.

15:32.796 --> 15:34.665
Glendale.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.675
We know Sybil is using Ben and Rhys

15:36.676 --> 15:38.275
to infiltrate the society wedding

15:38.409 --> 15:40.695
of Morgan Foster and Stephanie Duncan.

15:40.696 --> 15:41.725
Why Morgan and Stephanie?

15:41.726 --> 15:43.695
It's not them. It's Morgan's mom.

15:43.696 --> 15:45.675
Virginia Foster, who is the president

15:45.676 --> 15:47.320
and C.E.O. of Foster Shipping.

15:47.464 --> 15:48.815
30 years ago, Virginia
Foster inherited

15:48.816 --> 15:50.775
her father's bankrupt shipping business.

15:50.776 --> 15:54.805
471 vessels calling at over 316 ports.

15:54.806 --> 15:56.705
And she turned it into the largest

15:56.706 --> 15:58.655
and most powerful fleet in the world.

15:58.656 --> 16:01.765
Which means she controls presidents
and policy-makers,

16:01.766 --> 16:03.835
all of whom she keeps on her payroll,

16:03.836 --> 16:05.725
all of whom she pays in cash.

16:05.726 --> 16:06.775
She asked you to get blueprints.

16:06.776 --> 16:08.675
Of all of Virginia Foster's properties.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.795
One downtown, one in Benedict Canyon,

16:10.796 --> 16:12.645
Malibu, Santa Barbara.

16:12.646 --> 16:13.745
Judging by the layout,

16:13.746 --> 16:15.805
the vault should be
here in the sub-basement.

16:15.806 --> 16:18.685
And you said she killed a
man to get an access code?

16:18.686 --> 16:19.795
The combination of which

16:19.796 --> 16:23.865
Mr. George Tyson
thoughtfully provided before he died.

16:23.866 --> 16:25.645
But why rob a wedding?

16:25.646 --> 16:26.795
Sybil Griffiths has plenty of money.

16:26.796 --> 16:28.685
With Sybil, it's never
just about the money.

16:28.686 --> 16:29.825
And don't forget, she has Leah Wells.

16:29.826 --> 16:32.715
So, how much
currency have we made so far?

16:32.716 --> 16:34.805
At this point... $10
million by end of day.

16:34.806 --> 16:37.685
Well, based on the size of
this vault, we'll need more.

16:37.686 --> 16:39.326
- More?
- How much more?

16:39.461 --> 16:41.645
Well, look at the size of
it. It's enormous, isn't it?

16:41.646 --> 16:43.795
Best make $20 million, I think.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.635
- $20 million?
- By Saturday?

16:45.636 --> 16:46.715
There's no way.

16:46.716 --> 16:48.765
Oh, there's always a way, Mr. Lennox.

16:48.766 --> 16:50.825
I know you're not going
to disappoint me.

16:50.826 --> 16:53.695
But how are Ben and I supposed
to smuggle $20 million

16:53.696 --> 16:54.845
in fake dollars?

16:54.846 --> 16:58.695
You're not. You're going
to get the rest of us in.

16:58.696 --> 17:00.655
If you and Rhys can get them inside...

17:00.656 --> 17:01.675
Then you can get us inside.

17:01.676 --> 17:02.685
Theoretically.

17:02.686 --> 17:03.685
But how do we do that?

17:03.686 --> 17:04.845
Well, I'm going to help you

17:04.846 --> 17:08.685
by creating a few problems
that only you two can solve.

17:12.636 --> 17:14.645
We are going to have to
cancel this wedding.

17:14.646 --> 17:15.694
- Oh, that's a bad idea.
- No, you can't do that.

17:15.695 --> 17:16.835
Well, I don't know what else to do.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.635
The wedding planner quit.

17:18.636 --> 17:19.665
- What?
- Why?

17:19.665 --> 17:20.694
And now I've lost the caterer.

17:20.695 --> 17:22.744
So I have 200 people coming over,

17:22.746 --> 17:24.744
and nothing to feed
them, and no one to serve them.

17:24.746 --> 17:27.855
Well, Virginia, that is
not entirely true. You have us.

17:27.856 --> 17:29.855
We do it all. We have our own team.

17:29.856 --> 17:31.725
We've been trying to tell her.

17:31.726 --> 17:32.805
They've done hundreds of weddings.

17:32.806 --> 17:34.765
Destination
weddings. Celebrity weddings.

17:34.766 --> 17:35.776
Royal weddings.

17:37.836 --> 17:39.685
Well, not the last one.

17:39.686 --> 17:41.665
The one before that. We
can't really speak about it.

17:41.666 --> 17:42.735
Thank you for trying to help,

17:42.736 --> 17:44.785
but I have people
coming from all over the world.

17:44.786 --> 17:47.695
I have a Cardinal from Rome.

17:47.696 --> 17:49.795
And it's not the two
of you. I love my gays.

17:49.796 --> 17:51.805
I was hoping maybe
Morgan would be gay...

17:51.806 --> 17:53.745
No offense, Stephanie.

17:53.746 --> 17:56.705
But I can't just turn my
son's wedding over to...

17:56.706 --> 17:58.645
I'm sorry. Who's wedding?

17:58.646 --> 17:59.485
Honey.

17:59.486 --> 18:01.725
Yours, darling.

18:01.726 --> 18:04.815
But it is a gift that
Morgan's father and I are giving you.

18:04.816 --> 18:07.765
And traditionally, you don't get
to pick out your own gifts.

18:07.766 --> 18:10.705
You accept them, and you
pretend you love them.

18:10.706 --> 18:12.715
And then, when your
daughter gets married,

18:12.716 --> 18:14.645
you get to ruin her big day.

18:16.686 --> 18:18.775
We're gonna do this
wedding with Andy and Charlie

18:18.776 --> 18:21.725
or we're not gonna do it.

18:21.726 --> 18:22.815
Is that so?

18:22.816 --> 18:25.785
Morgan, how do you feel about that?

18:25.786 --> 18:28.577
How do you feel about that, Morgan?

18:29.726 --> 18:31.755
Um...

18:33.746 --> 18:35.706
Morgan is terrified.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.735
And not just because weddings
are terrifying...

18:39.736 --> 18:40.795
Which they are.

18:40.796 --> 18:42.805
- but because...
- He's frightened.

18:42.806 --> 18:45.815
Of hurting the two most important
people in his life.

18:45.816 --> 18:47.665
Which is you two.

18:47.666 --> 18:49.385
He wants you to have the
wedding you've always wanted,

18:49.386 --> 18:51.695
and he wants you to be able
to give your family and friends...

18:51.696 --> 18:53.775
And the Cardinal, God bless him.

18:53.776 --> 18:55.735
A night they'll never forget.

18:55.736 --> 18:59.666
And I have no idea how
to do that, but they do.

19:00.676 --> 19:01.845
Just tell us what you want.

19:01.846 --> 19:03.846
And we will make it happen.

19:09.846 --> 19:12.645
Your wedding invitations have arrived.

19:12.646 --> 19:14.041
- Is this silk?
- It is.

19:14.231 --> 19:16.775
Because Virginia said no
one uses paper anymore.

19:16.776 --> 19:18.725
Wow. This is almost as
nice as the invitation

19:18.726 --> 19:19.705
I got to your wedding.

19:19.706 --> 19:20.705
Val.

19:20.706 --> 19:21.725
It's all right. I deserve it.

19:21.726 --> 19:23.765
You deserve much worse.

19:25.656 --> 19:26.665
You two don't have to do this.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.785
If we don't put these people away,

19:27.786 --> 19:28.845
they'll come after us again.

19:28.846 --> 19:30.715
They will come after you at the wedding.

19:30.716 --> 19:32.865
Not in front of 200
people. It'll be fine.

19:32.866 --> 19:36.675
We'll catch them in
the act, put them away,

19:36.676 --> 19:39.785
and you will be free.

19:39.786 --> 19:41.755
You sure that's what you want?

19:41.756 --> 19:42.815
Mm.

19:42.816 --> 19:45.655
What I want...

19:45.656 --> 19:47.836
is for you to save me a
dance at the reception.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.656
I had better go.

20:00.646 --> 20:01.676
I'll see you there.

20:22.676 --> 20:23.735
How'd it go at AVI?

20:23.736 --> 20:25.645
Did you give them their invitations?

20:25.646 --> 20:26.926
They should be on their way now.

20:28.696 --> 20:29.815
This can't be right.

20:29.816 --> 20:31.695
This is the address on the invitation...

20:31.696 --> 20:32.815
252 Framingham Road.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.382
But it doesn't make any sense.

20:34.504 --> 20:36.775
Yes, it does. It makes total sense.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.705
Your boyfriend played us.

20:38.706 --> 20:39.948
Again.

20:49.836 --> 20:51.705
Ben's not picking up.

20:51.706 --> 20:53.306
I cannot believe we fell for this again.

20:53.399 --> 20:54.421
Some of us didn't.

20:54.422 --> 20:55.725
Listen, you guys, I know
what this looks like,

20:55.726 --> 20:56.775
but Ben is not playing us.

20:56.776 --> 20:57.825
How can you say that?

20:57.826 --> 20:59.795
He never wanted us anywhere
near that wedding.

20:59.796 --> 21:01.745
That's right, because he's
trying to protect us.

21:01.746 --> 21:03.715
He's trying to protect himself, okay?

21:03.716 --> 21:04.775
He doesn't want us near his big score.

21:04.776 --> 21:06.715
This isn't his score, it's Sybil's.

21:06.716 --> 21:08.715
And the minute that it's
done, she's going to kill him.

21:08.716 --> 21:09.765
- You believe him?
- No, she won't.

21:09.766 --> 21:10.845
And the longer we stand
here talking about it,

21:10.846 --> 21:12.845
the less time we have to
save him and ourselves.

21:12.846 --> 21:14.745
What about Virginia
Foster's other properties?

21:14.746 --> 21:16.755
Other than this lot, there's
the one in Malibu,

21:16.756 --> 21:17.795
the one in Benedict Canyon.

21:17.796 --> 21:18.865
Where in Benedict Canyon?

21:18.866 --> 21:21.705
I'm still waiting on
satellite images, but... oh.

21:21.706 --> 21:22.685
See that?

21:22.686 --> 21:25.765
That's... cars. A lot of cars.

21:25.766 --> 21:27.736
It looks like we're
going to Benedict Canyon.

21:31.686 --> 21:32.656
At least I am.

21:38.866 --> 21:40.735
You were trying to protect her.

21:40.736 --> 21:42.835
I'm not sure she'll see it that way.

21:42.836 --> 21:45.785
And if she does, she
still won't like it.

21:45.786 --> 21:47.715
Yeah. It turns out that women don't like

21:47.716 --> 21:49.856
being lied to and manipulated.

21:49.857 --> 21:50.865
Speaking of which...

21:50.866 --> 21:52.463
Virginia!

21:54.716 --> 21:55.775
Congratulations, darling.

21:55.776 --> 21:57.775
You look stunning, by the way.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.655
And the ceremony was lovely.

21:59.656 --> 22:02.775
Well, the reception's not
bad either, thanks to you two.

22:02.776 --> 22:04.775
I must admit, I had my doubts,

22:04.776 --> 22:06.665
but I couldn't have
done it better myself.

22:06.666 --> 22:07.865
There is no higher praise.

22:07.866 --> 22:09.645
Shall we have a photo?

22:09.646 --> 22:10.635
Good idea.

22:10.636 --> 22:11.646
Uh, excuse me, sir?

22:12.786 --> 22:14.805
Could you take a photo
of the three of us?

22:14.806 --> 22:15.865
Absolutely.

22:15.866 --> 22:17.786
- All right.
- Everybody smile.

22:25.816 --> 22:28.785
It looks like Virginia has
seven of her security guards

22:28.786 --> 22:30.765
stationed in the main ballroom.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.865
We're gonna need to hack
into these feeds, as well.

22:32.866 --> 22:33.845
Thank you, Jamison.

22:33.846 --> 22:35.765
Mum, how's it going?

22:35.766 --> 22:37.558
We're waiting till they
sit down to dinner.

22:37.559 --> 22:38.745
- Then we'll make our move.
- Mm-hmm.

22:38.746 --> 22:39.785
Oh...

22:39.786 --> 22:41.705
Well, who plated this?

22:41.706 --> 22:43.815
It looks horrible.

22:43.816 --> 22:45.695
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:45.696 --> 22:48.835
it is my pleasure to
present the bride and groom,

22:48.836 --> 22:51.725
Morgan and Stephanie,

What?

25:29.786 --> 25:32.655
Nothing.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.766
Just...

25:37.786 --> 25:41.645
Does Shawn have any
idea how lucky he is?

25:42.746 --> 25:45.666
I told you, Shawn's not really my type.

25:46.776 --> 25:49.655
So...

25:49.656 --> 25:50.755
what's your type?

25:50.756 --> 25:52.855
Apparently it's really
mouthy co-workers

25:52.856 --> 25:57.655
who are talking when they should
probably be kissing me.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.676
Yeah. I-I hate people like that.

26:04.796 --> 26:05.806
Hey.

26:10.726 --> 26:12.636
Can I talk to you for a sec?

26:19.757 --> 26:22.715
Look, I don't know what's
going on between you and Sophie,

26:22.716 --> 26:23.785
- but I just...
- Nothing.

26:23.786 --> 26:25.805
Nothing is going on between
Sophie and me, Shawn.

26:25.806 --> 26:26.805
I swear.

26:26.806 --> 26:29.795
Good. Okay.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.665
Because I didn't want
things to get weird between us.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.835
Good.
No. Yeah. Me neither.

26:34.836 --> 26:37.725
Uh...

26:37.726 --> 26:40.646
So... would you like
to go out some time?

26:41.856 --> 26:44.756
With me, on a date?

26:48.776 --> 26:50.635
We're wasting time.

26:50.636 --> 26:52.645
We have to let them at
least commit the crime

26:52.646 --> 26:53.695
before we can catch them.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.685
We should just arrest Ben
and be done with it.

26:55.686 --> 26:56.725
You know why you don't like him?

26:56.726 --> 26:59.745
Yes, as a matter of fact.

26:59.746 --> 27:02.705
Because you're both exactly the same.

27:02.706 --> 27:05.695
Mm-hmm. You both love Alice.

27:05.696 --> 27:07.745
You're both trying to save her.

27:07.746 --> 27:10.725
And you both lie to get
exactly what you want.

27:10.726 --> 27:13.785
What? I never lied to you.

27:13.786 --> 27:16.785
I told you it was
just sex, nothing more.

27:16.786 --> 27:19.685
See? I think you're lying right now.

27:19.686 --> 27:20.785
I think you like me.

27:22.796 --> 27:25.675
You are the worst FBI agent ever.

27:25.676 --> 27:26.825
Shh!

27:26.826 --> 27:28.785
I'm undercover!

27:28.786 --> 27:34.745
Everyone else here sees me with
you, and they're thinking,

27:34.746 --> 27:37.696
"He's just the luckiest
man in this room."

27:48.666 --> 27:50.675
You knew he was gay.

27:50.676 --> 27:52.715
I did.

27:52.716 --> 27:54.715
So, what? You were just torturing me?

27:55.786 --> 27:57.855
You made it so easy.

27:57.856 --> 28:00.855
You seemed like such a nice person.

28:02.716 --> 28:04.706
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

28:06.726 --> 28:07.926
What are you doing after this?

28:09.816 --> 28:11.845
I am going out with Shawn.

28:11.846 --> 28:12.845
What?

28:12.846 --> 28:14.695
He asked me out.

28:14.696 --> 28:15.845
And you said yes?

28:15.846 --> 28:17.635
He's such a nice guy.

28:17.636 --> 28:18.705
How could I say no?

28:18.706 --> 28:19.805
Daniel...

28:19.806 --> 28:21.806
Is it weird that I'm
kind of looking forward to it?

28:31.786 --> 28:35.645
Once dinner is served, they'll
start moving the money.

28:35.646 --> 28:39.666
And Val will call the cops, and
I'll have our guys move in.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.796
And then?

28:44.646 --> 28:45.785
What do you mean?

28:45.786 --> 28:48.665
I mean...

28:48.666 --> 28:50.855
if we take down the Firm,

28:50.856 --> 28:52.762
and Sybil doesn't kill me,

28:53.092 --> 28:55.319
and I don't have to spend
the rest of my life in jail...

28:55.668 --> 28:57.665
Mm-hmm.

28:57.666 --> 29:00.815
Do you still have your dress?

29:00.816 --> 29:03.666
Because I still have our wedding bands.

29:04.796 --> 29:06.805
You actually bought us wedding bands?

29:06.806 --> 29:08.695
<i>Well, I didn't exactly buy them.</i>

29:08.696 --> 29:10.745
You stole our wedding bands?

29:10.746 --> 29:12.341
The royal family doesn't
even know they're missing.

29:14.716 --> 29:17.705
Alice Vaughan,

29:17.706 --> 29:20.666
will you marry me?

29:30.846 --> 29:32.785
Sybil's gonna love these.

29:32.786 --> 29:34.706
She said to let you
know we're 30 minutes away.

29:35.726 --> 29:37.675
I copy that.

29:44.686 --> 29:45.966
What's the matter? What's wrong?

29:48.676 --> 29:49.646
Margot!

29:53.846 --> 29:56.182
I need you to do something for me.

30:00.816 --> 30:06.775
If Alice Vaughan is here, it
means Ben's betrayed us again.

30:06.776 --> 30:09.675
And Rhys.

30:09.676 --> 30:11.214
It seems you were right.

30:11.347 --> 30:15.785
I did make a mistake
choosing your father's successor.

30:15.786 --> 30:18.705
But you'll let me make it
up to you, won't you, darling?

30:18.706 --> 30:19.993
Of course, Mum.

30:20.215 --> 30:21.835
Right. We've got no time to waste.

30:21.836 --> 30:23.736
We have to move the money now.

30:27.756 --> 30:31.006
The key to dealing with
parents is boundaries,

30:31.007 --> 30:33.755
especially when you're
dealing with a narcissistic mother.

30:33.756 --> 30:35.685
And believe me, I should know.

30:35.686 --> 30:36.745
Even with Ben...

30:36.746 --> 30:37.706
Who?

30:39.856 --> 30:41.795
Sorry. Charlie.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.805
Where is Charlie?

30:43.806 --> 30:46.666
And why is he kissing
that woman on the neck?

30:55.706 --> 30:57.845
Y-You better let me handle this.

30:57.846 --> 31:01.765
<i>What the hell do you
two think you're doing?</i>

31:01.766 --> 31:02.865
We're getting married.

31:02.866 --> 31:04.645
What?

31:04.646 --> 31:05.766
What is going on here?

31:06.826 --> 31:10.685
What's going on is...

31:10.686 --> 31:12.372
the two of you should probably leave

31:12.373 --> 31:13.725
for your honeymoon right now.

31:13.726 --> 31:15.765
- What?
- What are you talking about?

31:15.766 --> 31:16.756
Morgan...

31:18.706 --> 31:20.021
your mother is a gangster.

31:20.152 --> 31:21.665
Well, I know she can be a handful...

31:21.666 --> 31:22.755
No, it's true.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.635
Virginia Foster is
involved in conspiracy,

31:25.636 --> 31:26.705
fraud, money laundering...

31:26.706 --> 31:29.635
I'm sorry, who... Who is she?

31:29.636 --> 31:30.845
I like her. I'm Stephanie.

31:30.846 --> 31:32.665
- Alice.
- Hi.

31:32.666 --> 31:34.695
These are outrageous accusations.

31:34.696 --> 31:35.835
Mom, if any of this is true...

31:35.836 --> 31:38.645
It would explain so much.

31:38.646 --> 31:39.695
I'm calling security.

31:39.696 --> 31:40.665
Please do.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.785
Tell them you're being robbed.

31:41.786 --> 31:42.805
By you?

31:42.806 --> 31:44.805
They're here to warn us.

31:44.806 --> 31:47.245
By an organization
called the Kensington Firm.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.815
The Kensington Firm is in England.

31:49.816 --> 31:50.865
So it is true.

31:50.866 --> 31:53.705
My mom is a gangster.

31:53.706 --> 31:56.725
They're expanding into your territory.

31:56.726 --> 31:58.775
Starting with the
vault in your sub-basement.

32:02.676 --> 32:04.675
This morning, they
smuggled in all the tools

32:04.676 --> 32:06.835
they'll need for the job.

32:06.836 --> 32:09.765
But not before they took
control of your security cameras.

32:09.766 --> 32:12.845
We're gonna need to
access these feeds, as well.

32:16.924 --> 32:18.835
Even if they get around the cameras,

32:18.836 --> 32:20.805
the vault door is reinforced steel.

32:20.806 --> 32:23.695
Yes, but your head of
security, George Tyson,

32:23.696 --> 32:24.765
gave them the pass code.

32:32.766 --> 32:34.655
And a counterfeiter named Leah Wells

32:34.656 --> 32:36.635
gave them everything else they needed

32:36.636 --> 32:38.575
to replace your fortune with fakes.

32:45.816 --> 32:47.855
As we speak, the
caterers are moving money

32:47.856 --> 32:50.692
from your vault, through the kitchen,

32:50.819 --> 32:52.825
and straight out the back door.

33:01.776 --> 33:04.735
But the real payoff for
Sybil isn't the robbery.

33:04.736 --> 33:07.725
It's when you try to
spend the fake cash.

33:07.726 --> 33:09.765
The bills will be
flagged as counterfeits,

33:09.766 --> 33:11.835
your business associates will drop you,

33:11.836 --> 33:13.164
you'll be in jail,

33:13.373 --> 33:14.865
and Sybil Griffiths will move in,

33:14.866 --> 33:16.855
taking your clients and
your trade routes,

33:16.856 --> 33:19.745
leaving you with nothing.

33:21.676 --> 33:22.855
Is this the last one?

33:22.856 --> 33:24.856
Then I'll take it myself, dear.

33:28.806 --> 33:31.695
You don't want to go out
there, Mrs. Griffiths.

33:31.696 --> 33:32.765
FBI's out there.

33:32.766 --> 33:33.845
Oh.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.805
Oh, haven't you heard, Ms. Vaughan?

33:35.806 --> 33:38.635
The FBI works for me now.

33:38.636 --> 33:39.685
Not all of us.

33:39.686 --> 33:41.676
The LAPD are on their way, too.

33:44.636 --> 33:46.705
So, this is the thanks I get?

33:46.706 --> 33:49.439
After all I've done for you?

33:49.571 --> 33:50.795
You were planning to kill me.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.765
And you deserved it.

33:52.766 --> 33:55.645
After all the things
you've done, the lies you've told.

33:55.646 --> 33:58.705
<i>And suddenly you think
you're worth something,</i>

33:58.706 --> 34:01.686
<i>that out of the blue, you can be good?</i>

34:02.826 --> 34:03.866
Well, he's not.

34:06.646 --> 34:08.725
But you'll see.

34:08.726 --> 34:10.815
When the police arrive, you'll
be charged with fraud,

34:10.815 --> 34:12.855
conspiracy, murder, attempted murder.

34:12.856 --> 34:15.696
Let's not forget theft.

34:17.766 --> 34:18.716
The money.

34:19.835 --> 34:22.676
Where's the money?

34:25.636 --> 34:26.676
Margot.

34:32.735 --> 34:34.775
Well done, Jamison.

34:34.775 --> 34:36.735
Do I finally get to talk now?

34:36.735 --> 34:38.415
Oh, I can think of far better things

34:38.416 --> 34:39.795
for you to do with that mouth.

34:44.652 --> 34:45.795
We can't thank you enough.

34:45.795 --> 34:47.735
- For ruining your wedding?
- No, no, no.

34:47.735 --> 34:48.864
You're giving us
leverage to use against my mom

34:48.866 --> 34:50.635
for the rest of our lives.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.715
Oi! The cops will be here any minute.

34:53.716 --> 34:54.824
- Right. You guys go.
- Thank you, Charles.

34:54.826 --> 34:55.844
- Thank you guys.
- Go.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.775
- Did you get the tickets?
- First class,

34:57.776 --> 35:00.705
with the privacy pods
and the lie-flat beds.

35:00.706 --> 35:01.795
Someplace tropical, I hope.

35:01.796 --> 35:03.756
Complete with no extradition.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.032
You two planned this?

35:06.187 --> 35:07.865
We wanted it to be a surprise.

35:07.866 --> 35:10.247
Also, just in case one of
us got shot or arrested,

35:10.248 --> 35:11.725
we didn't want you to
be too disappointed.

35:11.726 --> 35:12.805
Without your immunity deal,

35:12.806 --> 35:14.745
we have to get you out of the country.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.785
I am not going anywhere without you.

35:16.786 --> 35:19.725
No, you don't have to. One
of these tickets is mine.

35:19.726 --> 35:20.685
We're doing this?

35:20.686 --> 35:21.735
We are doing this.

35:21.736 --> 35:23.376
And the best part
is, I'm coming with you.

35:26.846 --> 35:28.775
I'll go home and get my bag.

35:28.776 --> 35:29.735
I'll see you on the plane.

35:29.736 --> 35:30.685
All right.

35:31.816 --> 35:34.795
Come on, you two! Plenty
of time for that in Togo.

35:34.796 --> 35:37.825
In fact, that's all
there is to do in Togo.

35:44.241 --> 35:47.695
It's just for a few weeks. You
sure you're okay with it?

35:47.696 --> 35:49.695
Just promise you'll come back.

35:49.696 --> 35:51.695
And be careful.

35:51.696 --> 35:53.645
Hold on a sec.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.865
Alice Vaughan?

35:59.866 --> 36:02.675
Emily Clark, FBI.

36:02.676 --> 36:03.865
Sorry about the intrusion.

36:03.866 --> 36:05.836
We got a tip about a stolen painting?

36:07.686 --> 36:08.715
One second, Val.

36:08.716 --> 36:09.815
We have a search warrant,

36:09.816 --> 36:12.856
and we're gonna need for
you to come with us, ma'am.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.055
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms. Vaughan.

36:21.056 --> 36:22.135
I just have a few questions.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.215
Absolutely. Happy to help.

36:24.216 --> 36:26.115
Do you recognize this painting?

36:26.116 --> 36:27.225
I do.

36:27.226 --> 36:29.105
The Singer Museum hired your firm

36:29.106 --> 36:31.035
to protect it at a recent opening, yes?

36:31.036 --> 36:32.155
Mm-hmm.

36:32.156 --> 36:35.105
In fact, you apprehended a
man named Mario Visconti,

36:35.106 --> 36:37.145
who attempted to steal the
painting from the museum...

36:37.146 --> 36:38.215
Mm-hmm.

36:38.216 --> 36:40.165
The same painting we found on a wall

36:40.166 --> 36:42.115
in your bedroom this evening.

36:45.056 --> 36:47.135
Sorry. I was waiting for the question.

36:47.136 --> 36:50.065
Did you steal the painting from
the museum, Ms. Vaughan?

36:53.166 --> 36:55.115
If I may,

36:55.116 --> 36:59.145
I think you're asking the
wrong questions, Agent Clark.

36:59.146 --> 37:02.055
Here's what I would be
asking if this was my case.

37:02.056 --> 37:04.215
Why would a
reputable private investigator

37:04.216 --> 37:07.135
steal her clients'
multimillion-dollar painting,

37:07.136 --> 37:11.165
then put it on her bedroom
wall where anyone could see it?

37:11.166 --> 37:13.095
Doesn't make sense.

37:13.096 --> 37:15.015
So, then I'd be asking,

37:15.016 --> 37:17.045
"What if the person who
called in the anonymous tip

37:17.046 --> 37:18.245
put the painting there,

37:18.246 --> 37:20.095
and who made this call?"

37:20.096 --> 37:21.205
And who has the most to gain

37:21.206 --> 37:24.045
from both of us sitting in this room,

37:24.046 --> 37:25.175
wasting our time,

37:25.176 --> 37:29.115
when we should be out
trying to catch this person?

37:29.116 --> 37:33.015
But I don't want to tell
you how to do your job. So...

37:35.126 --> 37:37.225
Unless you have a warrant for my arrest

37:37.226 --> 37:39.185
to go with your search warrant...

37:39.186 --> 37:42.083
I'm gonna go and do your job for you.

37:49.206 --> 37:51.206
You may go, Ms. Vaughan.

37:52.216 --> 37:54.055
Thank you, Emily.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.235
You left the party so quickly.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.436
Where are you?

38:01.587 --> 38:03.125
Well, you'll disappointed to learn

38:03.126 --> 38:06.225
I am not in a jail cell with my mother.

38:06.226 --> 38:10.075
In fact, you're speaking to the
new head of the Kensington Firm.

38:10.076 --> 38:11.185
- ♪ No more pain and no more shame ♪
- [Glasses clinks]

38:11.186 --> 38:12.195
Is that Alice?

38:12.196 --> 38:15.015
Oh, speaking of Alice...

38:15.016 --> 38:17.145
I wouldn't hold the
plane for her, if I were you.

38:17.146 --> 38:19.035
Margot, what did you do?

38:19.036 --> 38:22.075
Well, let's just say the FBI
may have received an anonymous tip

38:22.076 --> 38:24.200
regarding a certain stolen painting.

38:24.393 --> 38:27.125
So I don't think Alice will
be joining you for another,

38:27.126 --> 38:30.195
what, 5 to 10 years after sentencing?

38:30.196 --> 38:32.135
Enjoy your trip, darling.

38:32.136 --> 38:34.065
Tell my brother to watch himself.

38:36.016 --> 38:38.146
What? What did she do?

38:47.156 --> 38:49.095
- When did they get here?
- Half-hour ago.

38:49.096 --> 38:50.195
They won't let us in.

38:50.196 --> 38:52.115
And they made us give
them our phones and computers.

38:54.046 --> 38:55.075
Agent Clark.

38:55.076 --> 38:56.225
Ms. Vaughan.

38:58.176 --> 38:59.506
How'd it go with her?

38:59.772 --> 39:02.065
She didn't have anything, or
she would have arrested me.

39:02.066 --> 39:03.175
That's why they're here.

39:03.176 --> 39:05.055
And they won't leave until
they find something.

39:05.056 --> 39:07.225
Will they... find anything?

39:07.226 --> 39:09.105
They'll find everything.

39:09.106 --> 39:11.108
Keys to the museum, security codes.

39:11.109 --> 39:13.195
Everything I would have
needed to steal that painting.

39:13.196 --> 39:14.438
Did you call Ben?

39:14.439 --> 39:16.225
Yeah. It went to
voicemail. They're on the plane.

39:16.226 --> 39:19.075
I'm sorry, Allie.

39:19.076 --> 39:21.115
How bad is it? You couldn't stop them?

39:21.116 --> 39:22.195
There's nothing I can do.

39:22.196 --> 39:25.045
She has a warrant, and
it's not my case anymore.

39:25.046 --> 39:27.065
When were you gonna tell
me about the painting?

39:27.066 --> 39:29.155
I was gonna put it
back once I figured out how.

39:29.156 --> 39:31.245
So, we explain to the
museum exactly what happened.

39:31.246 --> 39:33.195
And they'll just believe it.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.055
I'm so sorry, you guys.

39:35.056 --> 39:37.045
This isn't you. This is Margot Bishop.

39:37.046 --> 39:38.045
Our clients won't know that.

39:38.046 --> 39:39.205
They will when we take her down.

39:39.206 --> 39:41.205
It's gonna be hard for
me to do that from jail.

39:41.206 --> 39:43.045
<i>You are not going to jail.</i>

39:43.046 --> 39:44.366
I called Gordon. He's on his way.

39:47.166 --> 39:48.165
Ms. Vaughan.

39:48.166 --> 39:49.225
Agent Clark.

39:49.226 --> 39:52.015
I just received a
warrant for your arrest.

39:52.016 --> 39:53.095
What?

39:53.096 --> 39:54.225
Based on what evidence?

39:54.226 --> 39:57.135
Proof that Mario Visconti
used Ms. Vaughan's security badge

39:57.136 --> 39:59.055
to steal the
painting. He stole the badge.

39:59.056 --> 40:01.045
We also found evidence that your office

40:01.046 --> 40:03.035
contacted the woman who
forged the painting,

40:03.036 --> 40:04.125
Elizabeth Workman...

40:04.126 --> 40:06.075
- No, that was me. I did that.
- Sophie.

40:06.076 --> 40:08.145
And then there's the painting itself,

40:08.146 --> 40:10.225
which was hanging on your wall.

40:10.226 --> 40:12.105
I'm sorry, but...

40:15.246 --> 40:18.185
Alice Vaughan, you are under arrest

40:18.186 --> 40:21.235
for the following Federal
felony offenses...

40:21.236 --> 40:24.225
art theft, fraud, burglary,

40:24.226 --> 40:27.215
money laundering, and racketeering.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.245
You and your firm are
given notice of Federal seizing

40:30.246 --> 40:32.095
and forfeiture of all your assets.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.065
You have the right to remain silent.

40:35.146 --> 40:37.125
Anything you say
can be held against you...

40:45.236 --> 40:48.065
It wasn't her. It was me.

40:48.066 --> 40:51.185
My name is Benjamin Jones.

40:51.186 --> 40:55.076
I stole the
painting, put it on her wall.

40:56.146 --> 40:58.085
I robbed from her and her clients,

40:58.086 --> 41:01.115
and framed her for everything.

41:01.116 --> 41:03.215
I'm the one you need to arrest.

41:03.216 --> 41:07.136
So you can let her go and take me.
