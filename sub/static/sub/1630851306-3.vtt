WEBVTT

00:09.777 --> 00:11.643
MY NAME IS JOE BIDEN.
I'VE BEEN A UNITED STATES

00:11.744 --> 00:14.277
SENATOR FOR 15 YEARS.

00:14.376 --> 00:17.644
>> HE BECAME THE FIFTH TO SEEK
THE NOMINATION.

00:17.744 --> 00:20.612
>> I HONEST TO GOD BELIEVE I'LL
BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE

00:20.711 --> 00:21.012
UNITED STATES.

00:21.112 --> 00:21.646
>> COME ON.

00:21.746 --> 00:23.746
>> HONEST TO GOD.

00:23.845 --> 00:28.414
>> SENATOR JOE BIDEN BOWS OUT.

00:28.513 --> 00:30.515
>> THERE WILL BE ANOTHER
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS AND I'LL

00:30.615 --> 00:31.682
BE THERE.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.682
>> FRIENDS, TODAY I FILED THE
NECESSARY PAPERS TO BECOME

00:35.781 --> 00:37.215
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.

00:37.316 --> 00:40.683
THE WORLD IS READY.
AMERICA IS READY AND I'M READY.

00:40.783 --> 00:43.251
>> JOE BIDEN.
I'M RUNNING AS CANDIDATE FOR

00:43.349 --> 00:44.683
PRESIDENT.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:44.783 --> 00:49.352
>> JOE BIDEN NOT DOING WELL IN
IOWA, WILL DROP OUT.

00:49.451 --> 00:51.284
>> LET ME MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR
TO YOU.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.420
I AIN'T GOING AWAY.

00:54.519 --> 00:56.253
>> WHAT A MOMENT IN HISTORY.

00:56.352 --> 00:59.653
>> THE THIRD TIME HAS TURNED OUT
TO BE THE CHARM.

00:59.753 --> 01:03.454
>> JOE BIDEN FINALLY WINS THE
PRESIDENCY.

01:03.554 --> 01:08.455
>> I PLEDGE TO BE A PRESIDENT
WHO SEEKS NOT TO DIVIDE BUT

01:08.555 --> 01:11.022
UNIFY.
WHO DOESN'T SEE RED STATES AND

01:11.122 --> 01:22.426
BLUE STATES, ONLY SEES THE
UNITED STATES.

01:22.525 --> 01:25.426
>> PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN FACES A
DAUNTING TASK.

01:25.525 --> 01:27.360
>> WHAT HE TAKES OVER IS A
FRACTURED AND DIVIDED COUNTRY.

01:27.460 --> 01:28.393
>> IMPEACHMENT TRIAL LOOMING --

01:28.492 --> 01:31.227
>> 400,000 AMERICANS DEAD FROM
CORONAVIRUS.

01:31.328 --> 01:33.194
UNEMPLOYMENT, EVICTIONS,
FORECLOSURES.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.161
>> THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE
CHANGE.

01:35.260 --> 01:40.429
>> THE RACIAL RECKONING WE'RE
GOING THROUGH.

01:40.528 --> 01:43.530
>> THAT EACH GENERATION HAS LEFT
BEHIND A COUNTRY A LITTLE BIT

01:43.629 --> 01:48.197
BETTER THAN THE COUNTRY THAT IT
INHERITED.

01:48.296 --> 01:51.265
AND I BELIEVED I COULD AND I
STILL BELIEVE I WILL MAKE A

01:51.365 --> 01:54.397
DIFFERENCE IN FULFILLING THAT
LEGACY.

01:54.497 --> 02:02.233
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MR.
PRESIDENT!

02:37.473 --> 02:38.175
>> HEY, GUYS.

02:38.275 --> 02:42.474
>> HEY, STRETCH.

02:42.574 --> 02:43.775
>> HEY!

02:43.875 --> 02:46.376
>> HOW IS IT GOING, GUYS?

02:46.476 --> 02:50.509
>> IT'S GOING WEIRD.
I'M IN THE D.C. GREEN ZONE.

02:50.609 --> 02:53.144
>> IT'S MONDAY OF INAUGURATION
WEEK, THE WEEK THAT FOLLOWS

02:53.244 --> 02:55.078
IMPEACHMENT WEEK WHICH WAS THE
WEEK THAT FOLLOWED INSURRECTION

02:55.177 --> 03:01.079
WEEK.
IT'S BEEN A BUSY JANUARY.

03:01.179 --> 03:03.045
>> I FOR ONE AM LOOKING FORWARD
TO INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK.

03:03.145 --> 03:04.646
>> I WOULD KILL FOR
INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK RIGHT NOW.

03:04.746 --> 03:07.114
>> AN INAUGURATION THAT WAS
GOING TO BE STRANGE NO MATTER

03:07.213 --> 03:09.715
WHAT BECAUSE OF COVID NOW REALLY
LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.513
>> THE REALITY IS THAT JOE BIDEN
WILL HAVE A HUGE CROWD BUT

03:12.614 --> 03:14.048
THEY'LL ALL BE IN CAMOUFLAGE.

03:14.147 --> 03:17.049
>> 25,000 NATIONAL GUARD, ZERO
TICKETS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE

03:17.149 --> 03:20.750
PUBLIC.

03:20.849 --> 03:26.317
>> ONE THING THAT'S REALLY SAD,
WE USUALLY SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL

03:26.417 --> 03:28.451
FORMALITY OF THE PRESIDENT
HANDING OVER THE WHITE HOUSE TO

03:28.551 --> 03:32.385
THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
WE SAW IT WITH H.W. TO CLINTON

03:32.485 --> 03:36.953
TO OBAMA AND THEN OBAMA TO TRUMP
AND THAT WON'T HAPPEN THIS TIME.

03:37.052 --> 03:40.419
>> IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME
SINCE 1869 WITH ANDREW JOHNSON

03:40.520 --> 03:42.687
THAT THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT IS
NOT GOING TO ATTEND THE

03:42.787 --> 03:55.323
INAUGURATION.
TRUMP IS SHATTERING TRADITIONS

03:55.422 --> 03:56.491
THAT HAVE PRE-EXISTED THE
AUTOMOBILE AND THE LIGHT BULB.

03:56.590 --> 04:00.590
>> WE KNOW HE'S LEAVING.
THERE'S A LOT OF SP

04:00.691 --> 04:01.791
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.859
>> AND HE IS THE PRESIDENT
FACING ALL OF THIS STUFF, RIGHT?

04:03.958 --> 04:05.525
THAT HE'S COMING IN HOT.

04:05.624 --> 04:13.460
>> HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO
UNDO THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT

04:13.561 --> 04:14.693
DONALD TRUMP DID.
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE CONGRESS.

04:14.794 --> 04:19.028
SO HE CAN ACT ON THE TRAVEL BAN,
ON JOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE

04:19.128 --> 04:20.861
ACCORD ACCORD.

04:20.962 --> 04:22.095
>> I THINK BIDEN THINKS THE ONLY
WAY HE CAN SURVIVE LIKE THE

04:22.195 --> 04:24.563
CRISES ON TOP OF CRISES ON TOP
OF CRISES IS TO GO ON OFFENSE

04:24.662 --> 04:27.429
AND NEVER TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE
PEDAL.

04:27.530 --> 04:29.830
>> THE ONE THING THAT'S
HAPPENING ON WEDNESDAY THAT HAS

04:29.931 --> 04:33.431
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE, AN
HISTORIC FIRST.

04:33.530 --> 04:35.299
WE'LL SEE A WOMAN SWORN IN AS
THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

04:35.398 --> 04:38.732
STATES, NOT JUST A WOMAN BUT A
WOMAN OF COLOR.

04:38.832 --> 04:42.200
>> YEAH.
IT'S ONE MOMENT OF PROGRESS THAT

04:42.299 --> 04:47.467
YOU JUST, THAT CANNOT BE DENIED.
HOW IMPORTANT IT WILL BE THAT

04:47.568 --> 04:50.602
LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS LOOK AND
SEE A BIRACIAL WOMAN AS VICE

04:50.701 --> 04:57.037
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.770
>> IT'S A REALLY POWERFUL LIGHT
IN WHAT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY DARK

04:59.869 --> 05:02.837
NIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY.

05:02.938 --> 05:04.371
>> IT IS AMAZING THAT TWO AND A
HALF MONTHS AGO WHEN THEY

05:04.472 --> 05:06.537
FINALLY CALLED THE ELECTION,
PEOPLE WERE DANCING IN THE

05:06.638 --> 05:10.840
STREETS.
LET'S GET PAST THE ABNORMALITY

05:10.940 --> 05:13.373
OF THE TRUMP ERA AND RETURN TO
NORMAL.

05:13.474 --> 05:19.541
>> I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING THAT
IS TRUE, THIS WEEK WILL BE THE

05:19.640 --> 05:23.075
LAST TIME WE SAY THE WORDS
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST

05:23.174 --> 05:30.342
TIME WE STAY WORDS PRESIDENT
BIDEN.

05:32.510 --> 05:36.111
STARTING AT THIRD STREET, WE
HAVE AN INSTALLATION THAT RUNS

05:36.212 --> 05:37.678
THE LENGTH OF THE MALL.
WE'VE GOT THIS SCAFFOLDING

05:37.777 --> 05:46.446
STRUCTURE.
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS A GRID

05:46.546 --> 05:48.580
THAT IS GOING TO SUPPORT 3,888,
THREE BY FIVE AMERICAN FLAGS,

05:48.681 --> 05:49.914
EIGHT FOOT TALL.

05:50.015 --> 05:51.114
>> WHY THAT NUMBER?

05:51.215 --> 05:56.015
>> BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER
FITS ON THE GRID.

05:56.116 --> 06:02.816
>> WHEN YOU WERE DESIGNING THIS,
YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE

06:02.916 --> 06:03.717
FLAGS AND NOT PEOPLE?

06:03.816 --> 06:04.850
>> YES.
WE WANTED TO UTILIZE THE MALL IN

06:04.950 --> 06:06.217
SUCH A WAY THAT IT COULD
REPRESENT THAT WE COULD NOT

06:06.318 --> 06:08.717
SAFELY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER ON
THIS DAY BUT WE WANTED TO DO

06:08.818 --> 06:12.318
SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTED ALL
OF THE UNITED STATES.

06:12.419 --> 06:15.818
>> HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
THIS GROUP IS ALL OF US.

06:15.919 --> 06:22.653
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE YOU CHECKING.

06:22.754 --> 06:24.554
WE ARE STARTING WITH A 150 FOOT
BY 300 FOOT AMERICAN FLAG.

06:24.653 --> 06:25.421
>> WOW!

06:25.522 --> 06:29.356
>> YEAH.
IT'S A FOOTBALL FIELD.

06:29.455 --> 06:32.489
>> KNOWN IN OUR BUSNESS AS A
BAF.

06:32.590 --> 06:41.392
A BIG ASS FLAG.
IT WILL BE UP A LITTLE HIGHER.

06:41.491 --> 06:51.960
>> BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY GET.

06:53.193 --> 07:00.395
>> IN A LITTLE MORE THAN 24
HOURS, JOE BIDEN WILL BE SWORN

07:00.496 --> 07:03.263
IN AS THE 46th PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.

07:03.363 --> 07:04.696
HE WILL INHERIT AN INCREDIBLE
SET OF CHALLENGES.

07:04.796 --> 07:09.897
AMERICA PASSING THE 400,000
DEATHS.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.864
PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN WILL
HONOR THE VICTIMS THIS AFTERNOON

07:12.965 --> 07:15.232
AT A CEREMONY AT THE REFLECTING
POOL.

07:15.332 --> 07:16.898
>> JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS
ARE STARTING THEIR INAUGURATION

07:16.998 --> 07:19.198
CEREMONIES HERE AT THE LINCOLN
MEMORIAL WITH A MEMORIAL SERVICE

07:19.299 --> 07:22.799
FOR COVID VICTIMS.
AND THAT'S SOMETHING TRUMP HAS

07:22.900 --> 07:28.301
NEVER DONE.
400,000 DEATHS TODAY.

07:28.402 --> 07:35.970
THAT'S NEARLY AS MANY AMERICANS
AS DIED IN WORLD WAR II.

07:41.003 --> 07:49.205
[ BELLS ]

07:50.638 --> 07:56.073
>> TO HEAL, WE MUST REMEMBER.
IT IS HARD SOMETIMES TO

07:56.174 --> 08:00.607
REMEMBER.
BUT THAT'S HOW WE HEAL.

08:00.707 --> 08:05.776
IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO THAT AS A
NATION.

08:05.875 --> 08:11.877
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.
BETWEEN SUNDOWN AND DUSK, LET US

08:11.976 --> 08:22.979
SHINE THE LIGHTS AND REMEMBER
ALL WE LOST.

08:34.416 --> 08:35.548
>> THERE ARE OFFICIALLY 6 HOURS
LEFT WITH DONALD J. TRUMP AS

08:35.648 --> 08:36.681
45th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

08:36.782 --> 08:40.782
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

08:40.883 --> 08:48.884
>> IT'S SO HARD TO ENCAPSULATE
IT INTO WORDS.

08:50.585 --> 08:55.152
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO HAS A
VERY MR. SMITH GOES TO

08:55.253 --> 09:00.888
WASHINGTON MENTALITY, YOU LOOK
BACK ON THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND

09:00.987 --> 09:03.653
YOU COME TO MOVE TO D.C.
SARAH SANDERS SAID SHE NEEDED

09:03.753 --> 09:05.821
YOUR HELP, BASICALLY.
AND THE WEIGHT OF IT IS

09:05.921 --> 09:09.288
SOMETHING I DON'T THINK I
EXPECTED WHEN I CAME HERE AND

09:09.388 --> 09:12.422
THE WEIGHT OF THIS MOMENT TODAY
IS NOT SOMETHING I WAS

09:12.522 --> 09:19.391
EXPECTING, EITHER.

09:19.490 --> 09:23.858
>> SO LET ME GIVE YOU THIS
CAMERA.

09:23.958 --> 09:27.792
I THINK YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.
IT IS AN iPHONE.

09:27.893 --> 09:28.560
LIKE, YOU'RE OUR GO PRO.

09:28.660 --> 09:29.460
>> DO I HAVE TO DO THOSE
MOTIONS?

09:29.560 --> 09:30.460
CAN I JUST WALK IN AND DO IT?

09:30.560 --> 09:42.028
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

09:42.562 --> 09:44.695
>> NOW AS YOU CAN SEE, THE
PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST LADY

09:44.796 --> 09:48.897
EXITING THE BACK OF THE WHITE
HOUSE.

09:48.997 --> 09:51.763
ABOUT TO LEAVE WASHINGTON AS A
TWICE IMPEACHED PRESIDENT WHO

09:51.864 --> 09:56.931
HAS INCITED AN INSURRECTION.
THE DISGRACED 45th PRESIDENT OF

09:57.032 --> 10:10.868
THE UNITED STATES WALKING TO
MARINE ONE FOR THEIR LAST RIDE.

10:13.869 --> 10:17.369
>> THERE IT GOES.

10:17.470 --> 10:20.370
>> DONALD J. TRUMP IS OF COURSE
THROWING HIMSELF A POMP-FILLED

10:20.470 --> 10:24.071
SENDOFF AT JOINT BASE ANDREWS.

10:24.171 --> 10:29.604
>> ALL RIGHT.
NOW HE'S COMING OVER HERE.

10:29.705 --> 10:36.641
>> ARE THOSE VULTURES CIRCLING?

10:37.007 --> 10:45.042
AND THERE HE IS.

10:45.142 --> 10:48.875
>> TRYING TO GET IN TO SEE THE
PRESIDENT DEPART DOWN TO

10:48.975 --> 10:54.143
FLORIDA.
THE SUN IS UP.

10:54.244 --> 11:01.845
SHOULD BE A GOOD DAY.

11:09.181 --> 11:16.282
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY, IT IS MY
GREATEST HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO

11:16.382 --> 11:25.883
HAVE BEEN YOUR PRESIDENT.
SO JUST A GOODBYE.

11:25.984 --> 11:37.019
WE LOVE YOU.
WE WILL BE BACK IN SOME FORM.

11:37.119 --> 11:41.120
SO HAVE A GOOD LIFE.
WE WILL SEE YOU SOON.

11:41.220 --> 11:44.821
THANK YOU.

11:44.921 --> 11:49.756
>> HAVE A GOOD LIFE.
WE WILL SEE YOU SOON.

11:49.855 --> 11:54.522
>> HAVE A GOOD LIFE.
WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

11:54.623 --> 11:58.490
>> HAVE A GOOD LIFE TO THE
VILLAGE PEOPLE, YMCA.

11:58.590 --> 12:06.426
YMCA

12:29.696 --> 12:34.630
>> SO HE'S TAKEN OFF.
WE'VE LEFT WASHINGTON.

12:34.730 --> 12:39.798
>> INSIDE, THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE CRYING, OF COURSE.

12:39.898 --> 12:43.267
I FELT ONE PERSON NEXT TO ME
COMMENTED, THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS

12:43.365 --> 12:48.401
A FUNERAL.h2W
THEY WERE AT A FUNERAL.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.402
A PERSON SAID, IN MANY WAYS, THE
COUNTRY DIED.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.234
>> THAT'S DARK.

12:50.335 --> 12:54.636
>> IT WAS.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT STARTED

12:54.734 --> 13:01.403
SPEAKING, A GIRL I KNOW THAT I
WORKED WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE

13:01.503 --> 13:04.771
WHO ALL DAY WAS LIKE, I'M GOING
TO BE FINE.

13:04.870 --> 13:06.205
IT'S ALL OKAY.
THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE.

13:06.305 --> 13:07.772
EVERYTHING IS FINE.
AS SOON AS HE START SPEAKING, I

13:07.872 --> 13:08.971
LOOKED OUT.
TEARS WERE POURING OUT FROM HER

13:09.071 --> 13:10.272
GLASSES, AND SHE SAID, I'M NOT
FINE, I'M NOT FINE, I'M NOT

13:10.372 --> 13:11.071
FINE.

13:11.171 --> 13:15.673
>> YOU SAW HIM GIVE THOSE
REMARKS.

13:15.773 --> 13:18.307
IT WAS LIKE A PREEMPTIVE DEFENSE
AGAINST A WIDESPREAD CHORUS OF

13:18.407 --> 13:21.907
CRITICISM.

13:22.008 --> 13:24.776
>> HE'S DEFENDING HIS RECORD AS
WOULD ANY PRESIDENT.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.676
THAT'S A REITERATION OF LOOK AT
ALL THE STUFF WE COULD

13:27.776 --> 13:29.008
ACCOMPLISH.
IF THEY WON'T GIVE US CREDIT FOR

13:29.109 --> 13:31.143
IT, BUT REMEMBER THAT.

13:31.244 --> 13:37.643
>> YOU KNOW, HOGAN, THE THING
HE'LL BE REMEMBERED FOR, THE

13:37.744 --> 13:46.346
FINAL ACT OF HIS PRESIDENCY, A
WHITE SUPREMACIST MOB STORMING

13:46.445 --> 13:48.881
THE CAPITOL TRYING TO KILL
LAWMAKERS.

13:48.979 --> 13:50.047
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF THING IN
THAT ADMINISTRATION THAT

13:50.147 --> 13:51.248
HAPPENED IN FOUR YEARS THAT
PEOPLE WILL TRY TO POINT TO,

13:51.348 --> 13:52.114
THIS ONE THING.

13:52.614 --> 13:53.647
>> HE'S GETTING IMPEACHED FOR A
SECOND TIME FOR THIS THING.

13:53.748 --> 13:59.215
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO
POINT OUT THE FACT THAT, HE

13:59.316 --> 14:01.484
ACCOMPLISHED A LOT FROM A POLICY
STANDPOINT.

14:01.583 --> 14:05.550
HE WAS A LIGHTNING ROD FROM A
PERSONALITY STANDPOINT.

14:05.649 --> 14:11.319
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS
LAST LITTLE BIT WAS A BLACK EYE.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.219
>> DO YOU THINK HE REGRETS
ANYTHING ABOUT HOW HE HANDLED

14:13.319 --> 14:17.552
IT?

14:17.652 --> 14:22.186
>> I DON'T KNOW.
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT

14:22.287 --> 14:24.421
PARTICULAR THING.
ALL I CAN DO IS LOOK AT WHAT HE

14:24.521 --> 14:29.754
SAID IN REAL-TIME.
I DON'T KNOW.

14:29.855 --> 14:34.956
I DON'T KNOW IF HE REGRETS
ANYTHING OR NOT.

14:35.056 --> 14:37.657
>> THERE ARE HISTORIANS THAT
SAY THIS WAS THE WORST

14:37.757 --> 14:38.958
PRESIDENCY IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
THIS IS WORST ECONOMY SINCE THE

14:39.057 --> 14:40.425
GREAT DEPRESSION.
THERE IS A SEPTEMBER 11th OF

14:40.524 --> 14:41.624
DEATH EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF
COVID, ALL UNDER THIS

14:41.724 --> 14:43.892
PRESIDENT'S WATCH.

14:43.992 --> 14:45.959
>> TO PUT THE STATE OF WHERE THE
COUNTRY IS AT THE FEET OF THE

14:46.058 --> 14:48.692
PRESIDENT IS --

14:48.792 --> 14:54.460
>> WHO ELSE'S FEET SHOULD IT BE
AT IF NOT HIS?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.961
>> I'M SAYING, THE VITRIOL.
THEY ATTACKED HIM BEFORE HE EVEN

14:58.061 --> 15:01.295
BECAME PRESIDENT.
OF COURSE, THEY ATTACKED HIM

15:01.394 --> 15:02.762
DURING HIS PRESIDENCY.
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPEACH

15:02.863 --> 15:04.296
HIM AFTER HE'S GONE?
THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS

15:04.396 --> 15:06.596
GUY.

15:06.696 --> 15:08.131
>> HE ENDED WITH GOODBYE, WE
LOVE YOU, WE WILL BE BACK IN

15:08.230 --> 15:09.564
SOME FORM.

15:09.663 --> 15:12.197
>> YES.
HE LIKES TO LEAVE IT OPEN-ENDED

15:12.297 --> 15:15.565
LIKE THAT.
91% OF REPUBLICANS SAID THEY

15:15.665 --> 15:17.731
WOULD VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN SO WHO
KNOWS?

15:17.831 --> 15:19.898
>> YOU'RE SAYING THE TRUE HEART
OF THE PARTY REMAINS WITH HIM,

15:19.998 --> 15:21.800
STAUNCHLY.

15:21.899 --> 15:27.200
>> YEAH.
THE GOP OF THE LOVABLE LOSER I

15:27.301 --> 15:36.668
THINK IS OVER.
I THINK THE SELF-LOATHING

15:36.768 --> 15:38.237
REPUBLICAN IS NOT GOING TO HAVE
A PLACE IN THE PARTY, I THINK,

15:38.336 --> 15:44.838
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.wY■

15:48.806 --> 15:52.806
>> SOMETHING I THINK WILL HAPPEN
UPSTAIRS HERE, DIVINE ENTER

15:52.906 --> 15:58.240
SPRENGS WILL PREVENT JOE BIDEN
FROM PUTTING HIS HANDS ON THE

15:58.340 --> 16:00.807
PEDESTAL.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR.

16:06.642 --> 16:11.310
>> BIDEN MOTORCADE STRETCHING
ITS WAY THROUGH THE STREETS OF

16:11.410 --> 16:13.811
WASHL ON ROUTE UP TO THE
CAPITOL.

16:13.911 --> 16:16.978
THIS IS A MESSAGE OF NOT TONIGHT
TRANSITION OF POWER BUT THE

16:17.077 --> 16:19.378
STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF THE
SYSTEM.

16:19.478 --> 16:23.112
>> THE BIDEN MOTORCADE DRIVING
RIGHT PAST ALL THE NATIONAL

16:23.211 --> 16:29.214
GUARD TROOPS.
O SAY CAN YOU SEE

16:29.314 --> 16:34.015
>> THE DIGNITARIES ARRIVING ON
CAPITOL HILL AS WE GET CLOSER

16:34.114 --> 16:38.582
AND CLOSER TO THE INAUGURATION
CEREMONY.

16:38.681 --> 16:41.115
WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HAIL

16:41.216 --> 16:45.550
>> THIS IS THE PRIZE FOR JOE
BIDEN AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF

16:45.651 --> 16:53.185
TRYING, AFTER SO MANY YEARS, A
MEMBER OF THE U.S. SENATE.

16:53.286 --> 17:09.155
THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE
HOME OF THE BRAVE

17:11.355 --> 17:13.489
>> SOLEMNLY SWEAR --

17:13.588 --> 17:18.789
>> I SOLEMNLY SWEAR --?
THAT I WILL SUPPORT AND DEFEND

17:18.891 --> 17:21.825
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES, SO HELP ME GOD.

17:21.924 --> 17:23.790
>> SO HELP ME GOD.

17:23.892 --> 17:29.026
>> ALL RIGHT!

17:29.125 --> 17:33.693
>> DID NOT FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD
BE THE NEXT CHAPTER AFTER TRUMP.

17:33.793 --> 17:34.794
BUT IT IS.

17:34.894 --> 17:38.795
>> PLEASE RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND
AND REPEAT AFTER ME.

17:38.894 --> 17:42.129
>> THE PRESIDENT'S OATH IS ABOUT
TO BE ADMINISTERED.

17:42.229 --> 17:46.429
>> I DO SOLEMNLY SWEAR --

17:46.529 --> 17:52.597
>> DO I JOSEPH ROBINETT BIDEN
SOLEMNLY SWEAR.

17:52.698 --> 17:53.832
SO HELP ME GOD.

17:53.931 --> 18:00.298
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MR.
PRESIDENT.

18:00.399 --> 18:07.168
>> JOE BIDEN TAKING THE OATH.
NOW HE WILL GIVE HIS SPEECH.

18:10.468 --> 18:14.902
>> WE FACE AN ATTACK ON OUR
DEMOCRACY AND ON TRUTH.

18:15.002 --> 18:21.437
A RAGING VIRUS, GROWING
INEQUITY, THE STING OF SYSTEMIC

18:21.537 --> 18:27.005
RACISM, CLIMATE CRISIS,
AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE WORLD.

18:27.104 --> 18:31.338
WE WILL BE JUDGED BY HOW WE
RESOLVE THESE CASCADING CRISES.

18:31.439 --> 18:34.039
WILL WE MASTER THIS RARE AND
DIFFICULT HOUR?

18:34.140 --> 18:38.274
WILL WE MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND
PASS ALONG A NEW AND BETTER

18:38.373 --> 18:41.107
WORLD TO OUR CHILDREN?
I BELIEVE WE MUST.

18:41.208 --> 18:45.975
I'M SURE YOU DO AS WELL.
I BELIEVE WE WILL.

18:46.075 --> 18:50.343
TOGETHER, WE SHALL WRITE AN
AMERICAN STORY OF HOPE, NOT

18:50.442 --> 18:53.076
FEAR.
OF UNITY, NOT DIVISION.

18:53.178 --> 18:56.443
OF LIGHT, NOT DARKNESS.
MAY THIS BE THE STORY THAT

18:56.545 --> 18:59.479
GUIDES US.
THE STORY THAT INSPIRES US.

18:59.578 --> 19:04.479
AND THE STORY THAT TELLS AGES
YET TO COME THAT WE ANSWER THE

19:04.579 --> 19:09.381
CALL OF HISTORY.
WE MET THE MOMENT.

19:09.480 --> 19:15.515
DEMOCRACY AND HOPE, TRUTH AND
JUSTICE DID NOT DIE ON OUR WATCH

19:15.614 --> 19:19.850
BUT THRIVED.
MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA AND MAY

19:19.949 --> 19:24.918
GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.

19:25.017 --> 19:30.585
>> WE SAW THIS STEELY
DETERMINATION AND COMPASSION OF

19:30.684 --> 19:31.884
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

19:31.985 --> 19:37.287
>> THE STAKES COULD NOT BE MORE
WITH REGARD TO WHO JOE BIDEN IS,

19:37.386 --> 19:44.321
WHAT HIS MESSAGE IS, AND WHAT IS
NEEDED TO COME.

19:44.421 --> 19:49.689
>> THAT SPEECH WAS, I THOUGHT, A
REALLY BEAUTIFUL SPEECH.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.721
>> HE IS KIND OF PHYSICIAN IN
CHIEF.

19:51.822 --> 19:55.355
IT IS LIKE EM, I KNOW YOU HAD A
TEMPERATURE.

19:55.456 --> 19:59.423
I'LL GIVE YOU A COLD COMPRESS,
I'LL TUCK YOU IN, MANAGER, AND

19:59.524 --> 20:00.790
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

20:00.891 --> 20:03.758
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF SPEECH
LIKE HAVING COME AT THE END OF

20:03.858 --> 20:08.559
FOUR YEARS OF MAKE BELIEVE AND
BULL SHIT AND LIES, WE'LL JUST

20:08.660 --> 20:10.559
TELL YOU HOW IT IS ALL THE TIME.

20:10.660 --> 20:14.360
>> THERE WILL BE BATTLES OVER
POLICY FOR SURE IN CONGRESS THAT

20:14.460 --> 20:18.694
DOES FEEL LIKE THE TRUE BATTLE
IS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO FACE FACTS

20:18.795 --> 20:21.662
AND FACE TRUTH AND TRY UNIFY THE
COUNTRY.

20:21.761 --> 20:25.762
>> IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO
SEE MITCH McCONNELL ON THE

20:25.863 --> 20:29.264
STAGE.
LIKE IT'S THE LOOMING SHADOW OF

20:29.363 --> 20:29.864
DISCORD.

20:30.364 --> 20:32.565
>> THE REMINDER OF THE FIGHT
THAT LIES AHEAD.

20:32.664 --> 20:39.200
>> YEAH.
THE THING THAT HAS BEEN MOST AD

20:39.299 --> 20:39.998
NOISHL NOI

20:40.098 --> 20:42.432
, ADMIRABLE, TO SAY WE HAVE
THIS.

20:42.533 --> 20:47.166
WE'LL HAVE TO BUCKLE UP AND DO
IT.

20:47.267 --> 20:49.468
>> THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON
ALREADY EVEN THOUGH JOE BIDEN

20:49.567 --> 20:50.934
HAS JUST ENTERED THE WHITE
HOUSE.

20:51.035 --> 20:56.502
>> INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE,
PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A SERIES

20:56.603 --> 20:57.569
OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS.

20:57.835 --> 21:01.836
>> WE ARE STANDING BY FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST PRESS

21:01.938 --> 21:04.137
BRIEFING.
IT IS EXPECTED TO GET UNDERWAY

21:04.238 --> 21:05.371
AT ANY MOMENT NOW.

21:05.470 --> 21:12.140
>> GOOD LUCK, THANK YOU, MA'AM!

21:17.339 --> 21:22.575
>> ALL RIGHT.

21:22.674 --> 21:26.308
>> OKAY.
HERE WE GO.

21:26.409 --> 21:29.008
READY?

21:29.108 --> 21:32.210
>> ARE WE GOOD?
ARE WE GOOD, ANGELA?

21:32.310 --> 21:36.077
>> 40 SECONDS.

21:47.012 --> 21:47.614
[ LAUGHTER ]

21:47.712 --> 21:51.347
>> WE'RE VERY PATRIOTIC TODAY.

21:51.447 --> 21:52.081
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOOD?

21:52.181 --> 21:57.682
>> WE'RE GOOD.

21:57.781 --> 22:01.016
>> WHETHER THEY CAN DO IT AT THE
SAME TIME WITH LEGISLATIVE

22:01.115 --> 22:05.417
THINGS.
BUT THAT NO DOUBT -- HERE COMES

22:05.517 --> 22:08.617
JEN PSAKI.
LET'S LISTEN IN TO THE PRESS

22:08.718 --> 22:09.317
SECRETARY.

22:09.918 --> 22:13.352
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME TO

22:13.451 --> 22:16.420
SERVE IN THIS ROLE, WE TALKED
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING

22:16.519 --> 22:20.987
TRUTH AND TRANSPARENCY BACK TO
THE BRIEFING ROOM.

22:21.086 --> 22:24.754
REBUILDING TRUST WILL BE CENTRAL
TO OUR FOCUS EVERY SINGLE DAY

22:24.854 --> 22:27.421
WITH.
THAT, I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOUR

22:27.521 --> 22:28.121
QUESTIONS.

22:28.788 --> 22:31.021
>> JEN, HAS PRESIDENT BIDEN
INVITED CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO

22:31.122 --> 22:33.789
SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE
COVID RELIEF MEASURE THAT HE

22:33.890 --> 22:34.523
INTRODUCED?

22:35.123 --> 22:36.922
>> HE'S BEEN DISCUSSING THAT
WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

22:37.023 --> 22:39.556
SINCE LONG BEFORE HE WAS SWORN
IN TODAY.

22:39.656 --> 22:43.258
IN TERMS OF WHEN HE WILL MEET IN
PERSON, I WILL SAY SOON.

22:43.357 --> 22:50.759
WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE OF AN
UPDATE ON THAT FOR YOU.

22:50.858 --> 22:51.759
>> HI!

22:51.860 --> 22:54.960
>> YOU'RE SO NICE TO GET US ON
THE DANCE CARD.

22:55.060 --> 22:56.995
I KNOW HOW CRAZY IT HAS GOT TO
BE.

22:57.095 --> 22:59.760
>> WELL, THERE IS A LOT GOING ON
HERE.

22:59.861 --> 23:02.562
>> YEAH.
SO YOU'VE BEEN AT THE PODIUM

23:02.662 --> 23:04.296
BEFORE.
NOT THIS SPECIFIC ONE.

23:04.395 --> 23:05.395
HOW DID IT FEEL?

23:05.496 --> 23:08.697
>> EVEN THOUGH I HAD DONE A
SIMILAR JOB AT THE STATE

23:08.796 --> 23:12.030
DEPARTMENT, YOU HAVE THE WEIGHT
OF, I WANT TO REPRESENT THE

23:12.131 --> 23:15.664
PRESIDENT.
I WANT TO MEET THIS MOMENT.

23:15.765 --> 23:19.498
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.
I WANT MY MOM TO BE PROUD.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.033
ALL THE THINGS.
ONCE I GOT OUT THERE, IT FELT

23:23.133 --> 23:25.601
GREAT.
I USED HIM AS MY GUIDE.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.602
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE
TALKED ABOUT, HOW TO MAKE SURE

23:28.700 --> 23:31.102
THAT I'M ALINED WITH WHERE HE
IS.

23:31.201 --> 23:35.035
AND YOU KNOW, FROM HAVING WORKED
FOR A PRESIDENT BEFORE, IT HELPS

23:35.134 --> 23:36.768
JUST TO LISTEN TO THEM.

23:36.868 --> 23:40.703
>> I REMEMBER HEARING FROM MY
BOSS AFTER HE READ THE

23:40.804 --> 23:42.703
NEWSPAPER.
EMI CAN GET PEOPLE TO SAY THAT

23:42.804 --> 23:44.104
ABOUT ME FOR FREE.

23:44.203 --> 23:47.637
>> THERE WILL BE DAYS WHERE I DO
NOT SAY THINGS IN THE WAY HE

23:47.738 --> 23:50.671
WANTS ME TO SO I'M PREPARED FOR
THAT, TOO.

23:50.771 --> 23:53.707
>> HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DO
THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE

23:53.806 --> 23:56.274
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION?

23:56.373 --> 23:58.708
>> WELL, THEY'RE NOT MY MODEL.

23:58.807 --> 24:01.275
>> THIS WAS THE LARGEST AUDIENCE
TO EVER WITNESS AN INAUGURATION,

24:01.374 --> 24:04.208
PERIOD.

24:04.307 --> 24:08.142
>> FIRST AND FOREMOST,
SELF-IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY

24:08.242 --> 24:12.509
TO CONVEY YESTERDAY THAT WE
WOULD DISAGREE AT TIMES IN THE

24:12.611 --> 24:15.643
BRIEFING ROOM AND I THINK IT WAS
IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO HEAR

24:15.743 --> 24:17.277
THAT.
THAT'S PART OF THE HEALTHY BACK

24:17.377 --> 24:20.545
AND FORTH AND THAT'S PART OF
DEMOCRACY.

24:20.644 --> 24:25.512
>> SO THE, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS
COME IN WITH A PLEDGE TO

24:25.613 --> 24:30.146
BIPARTISANSHIP.
IT IS KIND OF HIS DNA.

24:30.248 --> 24:32.648
YOU HAVE BIG STUFF TO DO.
HOW WILL YOU SQUARE THE THINGS

24:32.748 --> 24:36.481
YOU NEED 22nd THE PARTISAN SMIP
WILL CERTAINLY COME WITH AN

24:36.582 --> 24:39.548
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL?
WELL, FIRST WE HAVE TO KIND OF

24:39.649 --> 24:43.717
KEEP OUR BLINDERS ON AND FOCUS
WHAT WE FEEL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

24:43.816 --> 24:47.116
ELECTED HIM TO DO.
TO ADDRESS COVID.

24:47.217 --> 24:49.883
ADDRESS COVID, ADDRESS COVID.
GET IT UNDER CONTROL.

24:49.985 --> 24:55.852
>> IS THERE A POINT WHERE YOU
HAVE TO PUT BIPARTISANSHIP ASIDE

24:55.951 --> 24:57.152
AND GET RESOLUTIONS PASSED?

24:57.252 --> 24:58.819
>> MAYBE.
WE'LL SEE.

24:58.920 --> 25:06.153
WE WON'T WAIT FOR A KUMBAYA.
WE'LL TRY FOR A BIPARTISAN

25:06.255 --> 25:07.854
PACKAGE AND A BIPARTISAN
APPROACH.

25:07.954 --> 25:12.421
THAT REQUIRES LOTS OF TALK,
ENGAGEMENT CONVERSATIONS.

25:12.521 --> 25:16.257
IT IS OUR FIRST GOAL.
WE'LL SEE IF IT STICKS.

25:16.356 --> 25:19.524
>> WE ALL KNOW THE OLD AXIOM
THAT OVERNIGHT?

25:19.624 --> 25:23.424
A LONG TIME AND A WEEK IS
FOREVER IN AMERICAN POLITICS.

25:23.525 --> 25:28.959
>> SO THINGS CAN CHANGE FAST.
I CAST MY FIRST PRESIDENTIAL

25:29.058 --> 25:33.126
VOTE IN 1964 FOR BARRY
GOLDWATER.

25:33.227 --> 25:36.260
HE CARRIED SIX STATES.

25:36.361 --> 25:39.694
>> YEAH.
A LAND SLIDE AGAINST BARRY

25:39.795 --> 25:43.595
GOLDWATER.
IT PRODUCED LOP SIDE DEMOCRATIC

25:43.696 --> 25:47.729
MAJORITIES SINCE 1965 AND 1966.
LYNDON JOHNSON COULD DO WHATEVER

25:47.829 --> 25:50.963
HE WANTED AND HE WANTED TO DO
EVERYTHING AND HE DID IT.

25:51.064 --> 25:56.098
AND THEN THE REACTION SET IN.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WON FIVE OF

25:56.199 --> 25:59.732
THE LAST SIX PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS.

25:59.833 --> 26:03.432
>> IF WRITE SPEAKING TO
PRESIDENT BIDEN, I WOULD SAY,

26:03.533 --> 26:06.468
DON'T OVERREACH.

26:12.568 --> 26:17.236
>> THESE FOUR CRISES, COVID,
ECONOMY, RACE, CLIMATE.

26:17.335 --> 26:20.970
THE MOST URGENT ONE IS COVID.
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IN ITS

26:21.069 --> 26:24.071
FIRST HOURS OF OFFICE SAYING,
THIS IS WHAT HE GOES TO SLEEP

26:24.171 --> 26:27.604
THINKING ABOUT, THIS IS WHAT HE
WAKES UP THINKING ABOUT.

26:27.704 --> 26:31.538
DO YOU THINK IF THEY GET COVID
RIGHT, HE'LL BE ON A PRETTY GOOD

26:31.640 --> 26:32.206
PATH?

26:32.306 --> 26:33.972
>> IF.
I THINK IT IS A HIGH

26:34.073 --> 26:36.140
PROBABILITY.
WE REACH SOMETHING LIKE HERD

26:36.239 --> 26:38.606
IMMUNITY.
WE GET THE CRITICAL MASS OF

26:38.707 --> 26:44.108
VACCINES AND WE GET, ON THE WAY
THERE, COMPLIANCE WITH MASK

26:44.209 --> 26:46.276
WEARING, SIMPLE PROTOCOLS OF
PUBLIC HEALTH.

26:46.375 --> 26:50.776
IF WE DO THAT, I THINK HE'S APT
TO BE ON A ROCKET SHIP BECAUSE

26:50.875 --> 26:54.610
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO
EXPLODE WITH PENT-UP DEMAND.

26:54.710 --> 26:58.178
PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO RESTAURANTS
TORSION GET BACK ON AIRPLANES.

26:58.278 --> 27:01.912
>> WE'RE AT THE END OF THE
INAUGURAL WEEK.

27:02.012 --> 27:05.313
THIS EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL,
UNPRECEDENTED INAUGURAL.

27:05.412 --> 27:11.913
YOU THINK ABOUT THE VARIOUS
THINGS YOU THINK THAT JOE BIDEN

27:12.015 --> 27:13.481
DID RIGHT THIS WEEK.
THE INAUGURAL WAS A SUCCESS.

27:13.581 --> 27:23.682
IT HAD A LITURGICAL FUNCTION.
THE NATION HAS BEEN WAITING

27:23.783 --> 27:25.517
MONTHS TO EXHALE AND I THINK
THEY DID THAT BAT

27:25.616 --> 27:31.184
THEY DID THAT BABOUT NOON ON TH
20th.

27:31.285 --> 27:34.685
PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST NOW AS HE
TAKES OFFICE, 74 MILLION PEOPLE

27:34.786 --> 27:38.220
VOTED NOT JUST FOR HIS OPPONENT
BUT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STYLE

27:38.319 --> 27:42.987
OF RHETORIC AND POLITICS AND
COMPORTMENT AND DEMEANOR.

27:43.086 --> 27:49.721
AND HE GAVE THEM THE OPPOSITE.
HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS WAS

27:49.822 --> 27:54.123
RHETORICAL OATMEAL, NOURISHING,
GOOD FOR US, NOT VERY EXCITING.

27:54.222 --> 27:58.923
AND I MEAN THAT IN THE NICEST,
POSSIBLE WAY.

27:59.024 --> 28:01.923
DONALD TRUMP TRIED INJURY HIM BY
SAYING SLEEPY JOE BIDEN.

28:02.025 --> 28:09.125
I THINK MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
SAID, SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
