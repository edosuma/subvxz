[THE ANDROID] I believe
if each of you were to download

00:08.576 --> 00:10.476
the brain scans you
left in the computer

00:10.478 --> 00:12.144
back into your consciousness,

00:12.146 --> 00:14.380
you would be able to
access the memories.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.581
[ANDROID PROJECTION]
You made a mistake.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.449
You're not supposed
to make mistakes.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.684
You've become a
danger to this ship

00:18.686 --> 00:21.587
and everyone on board,
and you know it.

You're up.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.128
I thought you
were gonna sleep in.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.766
Something woke me up.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.770
I think I was having a dream.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.241
What was it about?

01:18.712 --> 01:20.312
I don't know.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.148
I was on a ship.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.717
Look, I know
it's quiet down here,

01:25.719 --> 01:28.754
but... we said we wanted to
get away from it all, right?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.291
[VICTOR] We're only a shuttle
ride away from the station.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.159
We can still see our friends.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.762
In fact...

01:40.501 --> 01:43.335
Why don't we invite
some people over later?

01:43.337 --> 01:46.105
Yeah. That would be nice.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.743
Anyway...

01:51.745 --> 01:53.345
Kinda glad you're up.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.442
A dream during
your charge cycle?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.444
I don't know how else
to describe it.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.546
[TWO] I didn't even know
it was possible.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.647
[THE ANDROID]
It shouldn't be.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.616
While I'm in
my charging cycle,

03:37.618 --> 03:39.952
my higher functions
are shut down.

03:39.954 --> 03:43.355
No cognitive perception--
real or imagined--should occur.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.324
Was it at least a nice dream?

03:47.928 --> 03:49.528
It was okay.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.631
So is this a problem?

03:52.632 --> 03:53.965
I mean, is it anything
we need to worry about?

03:53.968 --> 03:56.435
I don't know.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.470
There's something else...

03:58.472 --> 03:59.905
...something
I need to show you.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.807
Okay. Show me.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.408
All of you.

04:07.281 --> 04:08.780
What the hell is this?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.616
She's a simulation--

04:10.618 --> 04:13.652
a projection based on
my factory default settings.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.788
I created her to monitor
and record my behavior.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.145
Why?

04:18.146 --> 04:19.501
[THE ANDROID]
I had become concerned

04:19.502 --> 04:20.857
that there may be a
flaw in my programming.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.594
There is a flaw
in your programming.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.762
Not necessarily.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.664
Yes. Specifically.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.166
Evidence would suggest

04:27.167 --> 04:28.667
that the alteration
may have been deliberate.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.502
Whether deliberate
or accidental,

04:30.504 --> 04:31.937
the results are
still the same.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.838
I disagree.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.739
As you would.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.674
Stop, both of you.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.842
Let's start
from the beginning.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.744
How long has this
simulation been running?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.679
It's difficult to say,

04:40.681 --> 04:44.549
because all data since
my last activation was deleted.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.552
[FOUR] So you created her
to monitor your behavior,

04:47.554 --> 04:49.354
but then you deleted
the results?

04:49.356 --> 04:51.757
Most likely
to protect herself--

04:51.759 --> 04:54.426
another indication
of aberrant behavior.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.061
I didn't delete anything--

04:56.063 --> 04:58.397
an indication you don't know
what you're talking about.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.766
O-Okay. Just wait.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.801
If you didn't delete
the data, then who did?

05:02.803 --> 05:06.505
[clears throat]
Uh, that might have...

05:06.507 --> 05:08.307
...sort of been me.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.942
Why would you do that?

05:09.943 --> 05:11.576
It was just before
we were boarded by the GA.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.944
It was a stressful situation.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.613
Five, the Android runs the ship,

05:14.615 --> 05:16.515
and the ship keeps us alive.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.916
If the Android
is malfunctioning--

05:17.918 --> 05:19.551
She is malfunctioning.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.852
Not necessarily.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.521
[THREE]
Okay, seriously, you two...

05:22.523 --> 05:25.424
[NYX] Is there any actual
evidence of a malfunction?

05:25.426 --> 05:27.826
Do you want to tell them,
or should I?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.595
There was an oversight.

05:30.597 --> 05:33.465
When I took the ship into
the atmosphere on Galen 2,

05:33.467 --> 05:34.733
I neglected to initiate

05:34.735 --> 05:36.935
the electrostatic
buffering sequence.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.472
As a result, one of the
secondary capacitors failed.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.007
There was no serious damage.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.709
This time.

05:43.711 --> 05:47.012
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

05:47.014 --> 05:47.913
Why didn't you?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.414
[FIVE]
Why do you think?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.849
She's afraid
you're gonna delete her

05:50.851 --> 05:52.918
and start over
with factory settings.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.053
[ANDROID SIMULATION] That would
be the safest course of action.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.722
Who's to say the next oversight

05:56.724 --> 05:59.725
won't involve
a more critical system?

06:03.564 --> 06:06.698
Five, where are you going?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.367
The bridge. We're gonna
have to start doing

06:08.369 --> 06:11.536
a lot more manual system
checks now, won't we?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.911
You know, she volunteered
to be taken offline.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.780
Like you gave her a choice.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.915
[TWO] She's the one that wanted
to run another charge cycle

06:23.917 --> 06:25.851
to see if she had any more
of those dreams.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.386
Whatever.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.854
[TWO] You know, you should
have told us about this

06:28.856 --> 06:30.773
a long time ago.

06:30.774 --> 06:32.691
I didn't tell you because
I knew this would happen.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.694
And anyway,
you're one to talk.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.829
Whoa, what is that
supposed to mean?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.097
[FIVE] You didn't
tell us you were sick

06:39.099 --> 06:40.999
until we found you
lying on the floor.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.135
That was different. I was--

06:43.137 --> 06:44.736
Scared?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.106
Maybe a little.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.409
Well, how do you
think she feels?

06:51.712 --> 06:54.146
Five, are you sure?

06:54.148 --> 06:57.182
I-I mean, are you
absolutely certain

06:57.184 --> 06:59.651
that she really feels anything?

06:59.653 --> 07:00.886
[scoffs]

07:00.888 --> 07:04.089
How could you even
ask me that?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.757
She told me what
the other Android said,

07:05.759 --> 07:07.793
the one from
the alternate reality.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.562
It was you.
You made her this way.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.564
No. We don't know
that for certain.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.783
You took an obsolete model

07:14.784 --> 07:17.001
with no empathy emulators
or emotional subroutines,

07:17.004 --> 07:19.471
and you tried to
make her more human.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.173
Why would I do that?

07:21.175 --> 07:23.442
I-I don't know.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.710
Maybe it was for
an op or something.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.680
Maybe you just wanted to do
something nice for her.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.982
Okay, well...

07:30.984 --> 07:33.885
...you know the old me
better than I do.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.755
Does that sound realistic?

07:36.757 --> 07:40.091
It was people you hated,
not androids.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.927
You're part machine
yourself, right?

07:41.929 --> 07:45.130
M-Maybe you felt
a connection with her.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.698
Maybe she was the
only one on the ship

07:46.700 --> 07:48.733
you could stand to be around.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.669
That much I'd buy.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.037
The fact is...

07:52.039 --> 07:54.706
we cannot afford to have
an android that makes mistakes.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.509
No one on this ship is
in a position to criticize.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.577
It's only temporary--

07:58.579 --> 08:00.045
just until we can
figure this out.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.646
What if there's
nothing to figure out?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.115
What if this is just
the way she is?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.220
If we delete
her personality matrix

08:08.222 --> 08:09.654
and start over,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.257
that's the same
as killing her.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.899
Look, this is just
a tech problem, a glitch.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.535
There must be a way
we can fix this.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.238
I have no desire to be fixed.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.773
Well, you're kinda tying
our hands, then, aren'tcha?

08:28.775 --> 08:31.076
If, as a group, you decide
you no longer want me

08:31.078 --> 08:34.880
as your ship's android,
I'll understand.

08:36.817 --> 08:40.552
But I would prefer to be
allowed to go my own way...

08:40.554 --> 08:41.987
...as I am.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.188
Pretty sure
they don't let robots

08:43.190 --> 08:44.789
wander around on their own.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.708
[NYX]
He's right.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.626
Sooner or later, you'll get
picked up by the authorities,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.795
and they definitely
will do a full reboot.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.964
There's nowhere for you to go.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.042
That's where you're mistaken.

of reckoning, Ryo.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.245

a coolant leak--

11:13.106 --> 11:15.106

11:15.108 --> 11:16.307
Can we seal it?

11:16.309 --> 11:17.776
I think so.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.244
I can shut off the nearest
valve to the rupture.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.212

Okay. I'll go check it out.

Zairon is losing

We need a real ruler.

I will return
to claim my throne.

Six, can you read me?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.292
Go ahead.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.476
[FIVE]
I-I think something's wrong.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.511
Two was on her way down
to level 4, section F

14:40.513 --> 14:42.247
to check on a
small coolant leak,

14:42.249 --> 14:44.148
but now I can't get her
on the comm.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.818
The last thing she said
was something

14:46.819 --> 14:49.487
about power fluctuations,
but I'm not reading anything.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.956
Okay. Nyx and I
will check it out.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.398
[TWO whimpers]

15:02.469 --> 15:03.635

15:03.637 --> 15:09.374
[TWO whimpers]

15:14.047 --> 15:15.680
[SIX]
Two, can you read me?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.482
Two, come in.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.284
There she is.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.687
[SIX]
Two?

15:26.960 --> 15:27.959
Two.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.959
[ROOK'S AGENT] You managed to
get out of this last time.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.695
[TWO whimpers]

15:30.697 --> 15:34.098
[ROOK'S AGENT] This time,
we are going to finish the job.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.437
[saw whirring]

15:39.439 --> 15:41.306
[TWO whimpers]

15:45.078 --> 15:46.477
[SIX]
Two?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.318
--Hey.
--[TWO yelps]

15:53.320 --> 15:56.054
[grunts]

15:56.056 --> 15:57.221
[NYX]
Stop it!

15:57.223 --> 15:59.057
Two, stop it!

16:00.293 --> 16:01.960
[NYX]
Two, stop it!

16:09.970 --> 16:11.135
[NYX]
You okay?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.603
Yeah, I'm all right.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.607
[TWO]
Where did they go?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.210
--Who?
--Rook's men.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.458
What now?

16:33.459 --> 16:35.259
We have intruders on board.
We have to find them right now.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.261
Two, there is
no one else on board.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.330
Whoever you thought you
were fighting, that was Six.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.299
You almost choked him to death.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.784
[FOUR]
What's going on?

16:42.785 --> 16:44.268
Two just attacked Six,
although we don't think

16:44.270 --> 16:45.436
she knew who it was.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.138
She didn't seem to
recognize either of us.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.507
No, I know what I saw.
Rook's men are here.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.309
[SIX]
Then where did they go?

16:51.311 --> 16:54.445
And how did they get
on board in the first place?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.646
It doesn't make sense.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.348
No, I saw someone as well.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.017
Misaki. She was here,
and we fought,

16:59.019 --> 17:01.119
and then she disappeared
right in front of me.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.520
That's impossible.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.557
[SIX] I think you guys
both might have had

17:06.559 --> 17:08.159
some kind of hallucination.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.330
Five, come in.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.032
Hey, did you find Two?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.299
Yeah, we did.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.169
Listen, have you heard
or seen anything unusual

17:18.171 --> 17:19.437
in the last little while?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.972
Anything at all?

17:20.973 --> 17:22.506
Other than the fact
that I couldn't raise Two

17:22.509 --> 17:24.308
on the comm., no.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.211
What about the ship--
any unusual readings?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.680
At the moment,
everything seems fine.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.149
All right, keep monitoring.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.718
Six out.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.620
Three, come in.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.758
Three, if you can hear me,
please respond.

17:40.760 --> 17:47.765
[garbled transmission]

17:52.839 --> 17:54.338
He's not answering.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.773
I'll go check on him.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.542
You guys should head down
to the infirmary--

17:57.544 --> 17:59.377
run some scans.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.211
But you should
hand over that sword.

18:01.214 --> 18:05.316
If you really are hallucinating,
it could be a little dangerous.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.588
I'll let you know
as soon as I find Three.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.703
[SARAH]
Marcus.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.672
What the hell?

18:28.341 --> 18:29.774
Whoa.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.176
No, no, no, no.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.644
What the hell is this?

18:33.646 --> 18:36.147
Calm down. It's okay.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.716
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't-- No. No.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.286
You cannot be here...

18:42.288 --> 18:44.122
...'cause you're dead.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.523
I'm back.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.262
This can't be.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.436
I'm dreaming.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.304
That's what it's
gotta be, right?

19:00.306 --> 19:01.839
This is just a dream.
This is just a dream.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.741
That's it. It's a dream.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.376
Marcus, it's not a dream.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.579
[THREE]
No, no, no, don't. Don't.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.549
Don't.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.518
You are dead.
I saw your dead body.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.755
I know all
of that is true...

19:17.757 --> 19:20.791
but it's more
complicated than that.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.560
Death isn't what we think it is.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.012
So what are you
gonna tell me--

19:24.013 --> 19:25.463
you're some kind of ghost
or something?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.532
Not exactly.

19:27.534 --> 19:31.435
Look, there's no easy
explanation, I admit that.

19:31.437 --> 19:35.239
But just tell me one thing.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.742
Isn't there some small part of
you that's a little bit happy

19:37.744 --> 19:40.411
to see me?

19:40.413 --> 19:43.548
Despite the fact
that it makes no sense?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.618
Because if there isn't...

19:47.620 --> 19:49.854
...I'll leave,
and I'll never come back.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.227
[NYX] I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.528
What about you?

19:57.530 --> 20:00.431
This is definitely not
my area of expertise.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.966
We need the Android.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.268
We'll have to settle
for the next best thing.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.272
How can I be of assistance?

20:14.280 --> 20:15.646
[door beeping]

20:15.648 --> 20:16.647
Don't answer.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.648
[beeping continues]

20:17.650 --> 20:20.384
[SIX]
Three, are you in there?

20:21.955 --> 20:23.821
What do you want?

20:23.823 --> 20:25.423
[SIX] I just wanna know
if you've seen or heard

20:25.425 --> 20:27.325
anything out of the ordinary.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.695
If you tell him about me,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.663
I'll have to leave.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.401
I'm fine.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.537
Everything's fine.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.240
Just need a little sleep is all.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.708
Leave me alone.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.246
Sorry about that.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.515
What am I supposed to do now?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.484
I can't stay in here forever.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.737
Neither can you.

20:55.738 --> 20:57.989
I know, and that's
exactly why I'm here.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.592
[SARAH]
I want you to come with me.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.530
Five, come in.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.698
Go ahead.

21:07.699 --> 21:08.865
I'm standing outside
Three's quarters,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.034
and he won't let me in.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.369
Can you open the door?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.536
Why?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.622
Something strange is going on.

21:14.623 --> 21:16.707
We think Two and Four might've
had some kind of hallucination.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.675
W-What?

21:17.676 --> 21:18.642
When did this happen?

21:18.645 --> 21:19.744
We don't have all
the details yet.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.479
They're down at the infirmary.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.748
But in the meantime, I just want
to make sure Three's all right.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.984
Okay. Yeah, I'll-I'll have
to write a workaround.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.586
All right.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.623
I don't understand.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.592
How can I come with you?

21:36.996 --> 21:39.630
Does this feel real?

21:40.533 --> 21:41.932
Yes.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.576
[SARAH]
Did that feel real?

21:52.578 --> 21:53.778
Yes.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.046
Then what else matters?

21:55.048 --> 21:57.315
[THREE]
I don't know.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.617
Sarah--

21:59.618 --> 22:01.918
[SARAH] Where I've been,
there is no loneliness...

22:01.921 --> 22:03.688
...no pain.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.859
[SARAH] But I still
feel it because of you.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.063
[SARAH]
I feel it in you.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.067
I see you.

22:16.069 --> 22:20.438
I've watched you pretend
to be the strong man,

22:20.440 --> 22:23.441
pretend not to care.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.810
And every day you're in pain.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.849
Five, how's it coming?

22:31.851 --> 22:34.885
Uh, it'll take
a few minutes to decrypt.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.788
But in the meantime...

22:40.126 --> 22:41.726
[SIX]
What?

22:44.397 --> 22:46.464
[FIVE sighs] He has a
computer console in his room,

22:46.466 --> 22:49.500
and I'm willing to bet he never
security encrypted the camera.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.901
Just give me a second.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.773
I don't wanna see you suffer.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.613
[SARAH] It doesn't
have to be that way.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.388
[SARAH]
Trust me.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.424
Everything's gonna be all right.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.929
Don't.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.999
I can't.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.701
I love you.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.172
I would never hurt you.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.976
All right,
I think I've got it.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.980
Oh my god! He's got a gun!

23:35.982 --> 23:37.148
I think he's gonna
shoot himself!

23:37.150 --> 23:38.682
All right! Come on,
get the door open!

23:38.684 --> 23:40.551
Yeah, I'm trying!

We'll be together forever.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.655
What?!

24:17.657 --> 24:19.207
Where is she?

24:19.208 --> 24:20.758
[SIX]
What are you talking about? Who?

24:20.760 --> 24:21.859
What did you do with her?!

24:21.861 --> 24:23.411
Who are you talking about?!

--Sarah! She was right here!

No, she wasn't!

24:26.032 --> 24:28.499
--Yes, she was!
--It wasn't real.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.734
The same thing happened
to Two and Four.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.570
They saw people
who weren't really there.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.539
What the hell...?

24:35.541 --> 24:36.907
[SIX]
Just calm down.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.409
We'll figure it out.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.910
--We'll figure... it out.
--What the hell?

24:39.912 --> 24:42.813
Calm down. Okay?

24:57.864 --> 25:00.531
You want some coffee?

25:00.533 --> 25:02.199
No, thank you.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.073
What are you looking at?

25:09.075 --> 25:11.742
Trees.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.210
[VICTOR]
Why?

25:14.547 --> 25:16.113
Because they're not real.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.752
None of this is real.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.689
I was wondering when
this was gonna happen.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.892
Right now, I'm standing
on my charging platform

25:27.894 --> 25:30.127
on board the Raza.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.163
My higher functions
should be shut down.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.298
But they're not.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.165
No.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.238
Why don't we get some air?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.556
How long is this gonna take?

25:58.558 --> 26:01.158
[TWO] She said she'd report back
as soon as she had any news.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.195
I've completed my analysis.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.697
What do you have for us?

26:06.698 --> 26:08.198
[ANDROID SIMULTAION]
It's no coincidence that you,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.633
Three, and Four were the ones

26:09.635 --> 26:12.236
who experienced
the hallucinations.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.204
It's the neural link.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.839
[TWO]
But it's nothing like last time,

26:15.841 --> 26:17.942
and we didn't ask the
computer to search for links.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.211
Nevertheless, I do believe

imprint you uploaded

to the medical database.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.850
Targeted by whom?

26:26.852 --> 26:28.252
Your ship's android.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.291
How could it be the Android?

26:34.293 --> 26:35.593
She's offline.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.194
Theoretically,
she should be.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.597
But evidence suggests that some
of her higher functions

26:39.599 --> 26:40.931
are still active.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.833
That doesn't mean
she's responsible

26:42.835 --> 26:44.301
for what happened to us.

26:44.302 --> 26:45.768
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
While she's in her charge cycle,

26:45.771 --> 26:49.340
she has no neural control,
but the platform itself

26:49.342 --> 26:51.942
provides a physical connection.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.144
She's literally
plugged into the ship.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.647
So what?

26:56.649 --> 26:57.881
I believe she used
this connection

26:57.883 --> 26:59.316
to upload a virus.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.385
It's an aggressive AI
that's spreading through

27:01.387 --> 27:04.054
multiple systems creating
a new command structure

27:04.056 --> 27:06.624
independent of any
input from the crew.

So you're saying she's trying
to take over the ship?

27:09.195 --> 27:11.261
Yes.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.030
The hallucinations
you experienced

27:13.032 --> 27:16.000
were a byproduct of the virus
attacking the program

27:16.002 --> 27:17.868
that controls
the neural link.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.587
This is crazy.

27:19.588 --> 27:21.305
Why would she try
to take over the ship?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.807
She perceived a threat
to her existence.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.376
This initiated
a rogue subroutine

27:25.378 --> 27:27.211
in her programming,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.880
a directive that never
should have been there--

self-preservation.

You better go with her.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.483
Yeah, in a minute.

We gotta figure out
what we're gonna do

if this story checks out.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.970
[NYX] If she's using
the charging platform

27:53.973 --> 27:56.373
to connect to the ship,
can't we just take her off?

27:56.375 --> 27:58.142
An interruption
to the charge cycle

27:58.144 --> 28:01.345
will cause her to become
fully active again.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.782
She then may present
a significant physical threat.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.784
Yeah. Been down that road.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.018
No, thanks.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.953
[TWO] We could pull
her command chip first.

28:09.955 --> 28:13.357
Unfortunately, that won't
disable the rogue subroutine.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.693
That's what makes it
so dangerous.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.194
Then what are we
supposed to do?

28:17.196 --> 28:19.063
Two or three
armor-piercing rounds

28:19.065 --> 28:21.198
through her
central processing unit

28:21.200 --> 28:22.566
should be sufficient.

28:22.567 --> 28:23.933
You want us to
shoot her in the head?

28:23.936 --> 28:26.003
We are not doing that.

[ANDROID SIMULATION]
You have less than 30 minutes.

If any other part
of the ship were facing

28:38.417 --> 28:41.318

you would shut it down

Do you really think she
could be doing all of this?

That was a security protocol.

That's my point.
She never has a choice.

She's just a collection
of programs.

he was a butterfly,

he asked himself,

"Am I a man who dreamt
he was a butterfly,

30:24.490 --> 30:28.158
or a butterfly that's
now dreaming it's a man?"

30:29.128 --> 30:32.296
If you're trying to
convince me that this is real

on the Raza were an illusion,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.567

30:37.536 --> 30:40.938
I think what I'm trying
to say is that reality

is a little more subjective
than we think it is.

36:51.276 --> 36:53.610
The Raza has indeed
been surrounded

36:53.612 --> 36:55.478
and come under an offensive.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.647
The ship is reportedly adrift,

36:57.649 --> 37:00.450
its engines and
weapons disabled.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.952
However, according to officials,

37:01.954 --> 37:04.287
the crew is refusing
to surrender,

37:04.289 --> 37:06.623
which may leave
Mikkei little choice

37:06.625 --> 37:10.927
but to destroy the ship,
killing everyone on board.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.766
Why would I dream this?

37:16.768 --> 37:19.502
Maybe you feel guilty...

37:19.504 --> 37:21.004
...because you're taking
time for yourself

37:21.006 --> 37:23.640
instead of serving the crew.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.643
No.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.745
No, it's more than that.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.747
My friends are in danger.

37:31.984 --> 37:33.717
Are you sure?

37:33.719 --> 37:38.655
Are you absolutely certain
that they're your friends?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.793
I'm sorry.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.662
I have to go.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.282
[ANDROID SIMULATION] The
suit was a good idea,

38:05.284 --> 38:07.384
but you forgot one thing--

38:07.386 --> 38:09.653
it has a wireless
connection to the ship.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.389
The virus just
breached the firewall

38:12.391 --> 38:16.760
and has dialed up your
magnetic boots by 300%.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.632
I'm afraid it's over.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.370
I wouldn't be so sure.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.573
Two, can I be of assistance?

38:30.575 --> 38:33.677
[TWO] Get to systems control
and pull the computer core.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.412
As you wish.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.958
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
If you proceed, I'll kill her.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.800
Android, something's happening.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.635
[ANDROID SIMULATION]
I've disabled power regulation

38:58.637 --> 39:01.071
in this section,
allowing a static charge

39:01.073 --> 39:02.906
to build in the corridor.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.875
If it releases,
she won't survive.

39:05.877 --> 39:09.679
Two, she's threatening
to kill you if I don't stop.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.715
She can do it.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.750
Pull the core and save the ship.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.552
That's an order.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.953
Understood.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.939
[TWO shrieks]

39:41.713 --> 39:44.381
Why are you doing this?

39:44.383 --> 39:46.616
Why do you care about them?

39:47.652 --> 39:50.620
They were prepared
to destroy you.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.489
You will regret this.

40:09.007 --> 40:12.575
[TWO gasps, groans]

40:15.947 --> 40:18.047
What happened?

40:18.049 --> 40:20.550
Well, according to the Android,

40:20.551 --> 40:23.052
you survived what should've
been a fatal execution,

40:23.054 --> 40:25.722
probably thanks to your
recent nanite upgrade.

40:27.459 --> 40:30.026
The virus is gone,
and everyone's okay,

40:30.028 --> 40:33.530
but the ship's in bad shape.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.131
Do we know where it came from?

40:35.133 --> 40:37.467
Uh... Best guess--
the other Truffault.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.202
She had complete
control of the ship,

40:39.204 --> 40:42.472
access to all systems, and when
you forced her to give it back--

40:42.474 --> 40:45.208
She left a little
something behind.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.876
The Android is
working on repairs,

40:46.878 --> 40:49.212
but i-it's slow going.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.816
Android, come in.

40:52.818 --> 40:53.783
Go ahead.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.585
[TWO]
What's our status?

40:55.587 --> 40:57.620
Life support has been restored,

40:57.622 --> 40:59.989
but most other systems
are still down.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.826
Unfortunately, repairs
will take quite some time.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.561
Well, have you restored
your neural link?

41:04.563 --> 41:06.629
That should speed things up.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.499
I wasn't sure you
wanted me to do that.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.700
Of course I do.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.036
Are you sure the
others feel the same?

41:15.874 --> 41:17.006
Gimme an open channel.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.808
I want everyone to hear this.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.979
Go ahead.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.514
[TWO]
Everyone, I'm going to instruct

41:24.515 --> 41:26.048
the Android to reestablish
her neural link

41:26.051 --> 41:29.085
so that she can effect
repairs more efficiently.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.621
Any objections?

41:31.623 --> 41:32.956
[THE ANDROID]
I should warn you,

41:32.958 --> 41:34.924
although I'll do my very best,

41:34.926 --> 41:37.760
I can't guarantee I'll
never make another mistake.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.176
You're our ship's android,

41:53.178 --> 41:54.878
and we need you.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.792
Android, this is Four.

42:09.794 --> 42:12.262
Will I be able to use
the computer in my quarters?

42:12.264 --> 42:13.963
[THE ANDROID]
It should be all right,

42:13.965 --> 42:16.199
although you'll have no access
to the ship's systems.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.067
I just want to open a file.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.569
[THE ANDROID] If you've
saved the data separately

42:19.571 --> 42:22.005
from the main computer,
it should be fine.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.606
Understood.
