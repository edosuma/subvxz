WEBVTT

00:00.428 --> 00:01.696
You're looking good, dad.

00:01.835 --> 00:04.078
I'd say you shaved a few
minutes off your last lap.

00:04.224 --> 00:05.374
If I had to guess,

00:05.404 --> 00:08.083
I'd think you're clocking in
at about a 45-minute mile,

00:08.113 --> 00:10.166
which puts you just
behind Mrs. Abalone.

00:10.196 --> 00:11.247
Lorelai, really.

00:11.277 --> 00:12.968
I think that's an
unfair comparison.

00:12.998 --> 00:16.251
Mrs. Abalone had her bypass
two whole days before mine.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.735
No no, no excuses.
You just have to dig a little deeper.

00:18.766 --> 00:21.990
Come on, grandpa, just visualize Mrs.
Abalone eating your dust.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.347
- Rory, honestly.
- No, it's all right.

00:24.952 --> 00:25.976
How's this?

00:26.225 --> 00:29.534
Wow, I would say we have
a new slow-walk leader

00:29.569 --> 00:31.202
in the cardiac-recovery wing.

00:31.237 --> 00:32.229
Hey, do you hear that?

00:32.625 --> 00:33.963
What, the crowd cheering?

00:33.997 --> 00:36.621
Whoo! Yeah, grandpa!

00:36.655 --> 00:38.711
Would you two stop?
You're making a scene.

00:38.745 --> 00:40.910
Mr. Gilmore,
congratulations on your recent victory.

00:40.946 --> 00:43.841
Any opinions about the
allegations of steroid use

00:43.875 --> 00:45.112
among your fellow athletes?

00:45.146 --> 00:48.050
I consider myself proof
positive that it can be done...

00:48.085 --> 00:49.320
and done clean.

00:49.358 --> 00:51.253
Richard, must you
encourage them?

00:51.288 --> 00:52.420
Excuse me, Emily.

00:52.458 --> 00:54.880
I'm getting a little stir
crazy in this place.

00:54.915 --> 00:56.830
You'll be getting out
of here soon enough.

00:56.866 --> 01:00.382
Oh, I forgot to tell you -- Kate and
Daniel Urman called to send
their regards.

01:00.418 --> 01:01.893
Oh, hey, Mr. Gavelle.

01:01.926 --> 01:03.050
Looking good, Ira.

01:03.187 --> 01:05.470
They sent a lovely floral
arrangement to the house.

01:05.507 --> 01:08.603
Although personally I find white
roses a little uninspiring.

01:08.638 --> 01:11.582
I think my favorite arrangement is
still the one that Christopher sent.

01:11.615 --> 01:14.560
It was very tasteful and
appropriate and so colorful.

01:14.597 --> 01:17.220
I mean, we're not in mourning,
for heaven's sake.

01:17.255 --> 01:20.291
I'm getting very tired of white flowers.
You thanked him for us?

01:20.328 --> 01:22.292
Uh, yeah.
Hey, you know that young guy

01:22.325 --> 01:25.191
who's been visiting miss
Santiago in room 236?

01:25.225 --> 01:26.681
Not her son. Her boyfriend.

01:26.718 --> 01:27.760
- No!
- Yes.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.023
Girls, I don't think that's
any of our business.

01:30.055 --> 01:32.231
But he's at least 20
years younger than she is.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.703
- 32 according to the night nurse.
- 32?

01:34.737 --> 01:37.431
He's just a boy. What could they
possibly have to talk about?

01:37.468 --> 01:40.213
I don't think they're doing a lot of
talking, if you know what I mean.

01:40.245 --> 01:42.353
I most certainly do
not know what you mean.

01:42.388 --> 01:43.692
All right, that's enough.

01:43.727 --> 01:45.463
Rory, when are you
heading back to Yale?

01:45.496 --> 01:46.673
Yeah, you should
hit the road, huh?

01:46.705 --> 01:49.262
Yeah. Remember,
you owe me a full report on the T.A.

01:49.297 --> 01:50.921
that's taking over my spot.

01:50.957 --> 01:54.513
The whole semester should
concentrate on microeconomics,

01:54.546 --> 01:57.722
so if this Culbertson fellow
even mentions Ben Bernanke,

01:57.756 --> 01:59.670
- give me a call.
- I promise I will.

01:59.705 --> 02:01.973
But actually, I was thinking maybe
I'd hang out here with you guys

02:02.008 --> 02:03.691
a little longer and
go back next week.

02:03.728 --> 02:05.601
- What?
- Don't be silly, Rory.

02:05.635 --> 02:08.070
- You're going back today.
- I've only missed two days.

02:08.107 --> 02:09.512
Two days? That's plenty.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.390
But it's just the
beginning of school.

02:11.425 --> 02:12.850
It doesn't matter.
It's not a big deal.

02:12.888 --> 02:15.851
It is a very big deal.
Plus, we already decided.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.151
Yeah, but haven't you ever decided
something and then changed your mind?

02:19.487 --> 02:22.180
Honey, listen,
everything is gonna be fine.

02:22.216 --> 02:24.842
Grandpa's doing great.
There's no reason for you to stay.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.430
What if he needs something?

02:26.465 --> 02:27.932
Grandma has got
this place wired.

02:27.967 --> 02:30.421
She's already slipped the nurses
something to keep the ice chips coming.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.073
- Really, he's fine.
- Okay.

02:32.107 --> 02:34.123
- What about you?
- What about me?

02:34.155 --> 02:35.991
I don't want you to
have to go home alone.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.201
Oh, I'm fine.

02:37.235 --> 02:38.790
Yeah, but dad hasn't been home.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.403
Well, he's with G.G.
at his mom's.

02:41.438 --> 02:43.021
Okay, but for how long?

02:43.057 --> 02:45.330
I don't know, honey.
He just said he needed some time.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.602
How much time?

02:46.637 --> 02:49.431
He didn't say.
Look, I've had my hands full here,

02:49.466 --> 02:51.641
so I really didn't want to
get into it over the phone.

02:51.677 --> 02:54.073
Do you want me to call him
and just see what's going on?

02:54.106 --> 02:55.681
Absolutely not.

02:55.716 --> 02:58.711
Well, what is his problem?
It was just a character reference.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.543
Hey, don't worry about it.
It's between me and your dad.

03:01.577 --> 03:03.660
We're gonna work it out, okay?

03:03.936 --> 03:04.912
Okay.

03:04.945 --> 03:07.683
"Okay" like you're
gonna go back to school

03:07.716 --> 03:09.542
like our original deal?

03:09.736 --> 03:11.452
I will go back to school.

03:11.488 --> 03:13.291
However, for future reference,

03:13.328 --> 03:15.731
the next time we have a conversation
where I say, "maybe friday,"

03:15.767 --> 03:17.681
that does not mean that
we have struck a deal.

03:17.717 --> 03:21.272
See, I remember you saying "absolutely,
definitely, positively friday."

03:21.307 --> 03:24.000
Oh,  so it's your
word against mine?

03:24.038 --> 03:26.373
It's a classic case of she said,
she said.

03:27.135 --> 03:28.810
Hi, Mrs. Santiago.

03:29.416 --> 03:31.021
Her boyfriend, really?

03:31.057 --> 03:32.390
She's got a nice butt.

03:32.428 --> 03:33.711
- What?
- What?

03:33.746 --> 03:35.391
It's the hospital gowns.
Believe me.

03:35.428 --> 03:37.413
I wish I did not know that.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

04:33.445 --> 04:34.472
- You're back.
- I'm back.

04:34.507 --> 04:35.450
Thanks for the call.

04:35.486 --> 04:37.973
- Hey, how's your dad?
- Oh, he's great, thanks.

04:38.006 --> 04:40.850
How was the Wilson wedding?
I can't believe she added 15 people

04:40.885 --> 04:42.293
- at the last minute.
- I know, right?

04:42.325 --> 04:44.181
It took us an hour to get
the extra rooms ready,

04:44.215 --> 04:46.781
but we sent welcome baskets up like
you said, and everyone seemed fine.

04:46.817 --> 04:48.330
- Even the mother-in-law?
- She was awful.

04:48.368 --> 04:49.500
She's a beast.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.853
- Hey!
- There she is!

04:52.976 --> 04:53.870
So?

04:53.906 --> 04:57.192
Well, he made his nurse go get him
a Wall Street journal this morning.

04:57.226 --> 04:58.460
That's good!
That's a good sign!

04:58.495 --> 04:59.713
Yeah, he's doing better.

04:59.745 --> 05:01.772
And thanks for the cookies.
They were a big hit.

05:01.807 --> 05:03.622
Oh, good. With these cravings,

05:03.657 --> 05:06.503
all  I feel like cooking is chili with
cayenne pepper and extra onions,

05:06.535 --> 05:09.080
but I didn't think chili with cayenne
pepper and extra onions cookies

05:09.116 --> 05:10.632
would go over well
with your parents.

05:10.707 --> 05:12.872
Tell them it's exotic and expensive,
and they'll love it.

05:12.907 --> 05:14.842
The little one has
a spicy palate, huh?

05:14.876 --> 05:16.460
Yeah, except for the
cauliflower thing.

05:16.498 --> 05:18.883
He or she has got a
huge cauliflower thing.

05:18.916 --> 05:21.121
Also not a good cookie.
Oh, hi.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.442
Hello, Lorelai. Welcome back.

05:22.478 --> 05:24.730
Thanks. What's with the dog?

05:24.766 --> 05:25.750
Why is that here?

05:25.787 --> 05:27.540
I assume you're
talking about Paw-Paw.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.840
I'm talking about the furry thing
that you know you're not supposed

05:29.877 --> 05:32.592
to bring to work due to the fact
that many of our guests do not enjoy

05:32.628 --> 05:35.042
finding dog hairs in
their lobster bisque.

05:35.078 --> 05:36.672
I had no choice but to
bring him in today.

05:36.705 --> 05:38.012
Paw-Paw could not
be left alone.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.352
His brother Chin Chin
passed away last night.

05:40.387 --> 05:41.833
Michel, I'm so sorry.

05:41.868 --> 05:43.723
Paw-Paw is beside himself.

05:45.228 --> 05:46.891
I'm really sorry, Michel.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.782
You didn't even like him.

05:49.196 --> 05:51.300
Sure, I did. That little guy!

05:51.336 --> 05:53.892
You called him a
walking flea circus.

05:54.265 --> 05:56.621
Chin Chin was a
wonderful dog, Michel.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.311
Thank you.

05:57.347 --> 06:00.380
Yeah. Remember at
the labor day picnic,

06:00.411 --> 06:02.127
I dropped my sandwich,
and I was like,

06:02.152 --> 06:04.336
"oh, great,
now I've got to clean this all up."

06:04.365 --> 06:08.434
And Chin Chin just came
in and scooped it up,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.102
and saved me that trip.

06:10.138 --> 06:11.633
That was Paw-Paw.

06:11.668 --> 06:12.952
What? No!

06:12.987 --> 06:14.281
I was standing right there.

06:14.318 --> 06:16.153
That was Paw-Paw who
ate your sandwich.

06:16.186 --> 06:18.451
Chin Chin didn't
even like barbecue.

06:18.487 --> 06:20.551
Oh, well, still.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.873
Still what?! Are your two stinky
little children interchangeable?

06:23.906 --> 06:25.391
Hey! Excuse me!

06:25.427 --> 06:27.271
What Sookie means to say
and what I mean to say

06:27.308 --> 06:29.150
is we're very sorry
for your loss.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.790
Thank you, Lorelai.

06:31.185 --> 06:33.963
He was always such
a sweet little dog.

06:33.995 --> 06:36.653
What a personality. So warm.

06:36.807 --> 06:40.862
Warm. Yes.
And, um, fuzzy and...

06:40.897 --> 06:43.502
I just can't believe he's gone.

06:43.538 --> 06:47.412
It doesn't feel real.
I miss him so much.

06:47.555 --> 06:50.233
Well, you should have a
memorial or something.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.311
Yeah, that's a good idea.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.431
Oh. I suppose it is.

06:54.468 --> 06:57.071
Yeah, it'll give you and
Paw-Paw a chance to say goodbye.

06:57.105 --> 06:58.652
That might be nice.

06:58.687 --> 07:00.263
Could you do it by tomorrow?

07:00.295 --> 07:01.533
Me? What?

07:01.566 --> 07:05.002
If you're going to put together
a memorial, it should be soon.

07:05.187 --> 07:08.530
Uh... yeah, sure.
Tomorrow would be fine.

07:08.565 --> 07:10.160
All right, that sounds fine.

07:10.198 --> 07:13.093
Well,  I guess I should get
started on the guest list.

07:13.125 --> 07:16.563
There are so many people who
will want to pay their respects.

07:16.797 --> 07:18.252
Paw-Paw. Come on.

07:19.956 --> 07:22.631
Any objections to holding
a chow funeral, speak now,

07:22.665 --> 07:23.773
although it's already too late.

07:23.806 --> 07:27.052
Oh, it's a nice idea, though.
He was so upset.

07:27.087 --> 07:29.381
I could have sworn the
sandwich dog was Chin Chin.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.293
It was hard to tell the difference
between them. They were both so --

07:31.328 --> 07:33.073
- Aloof.
- I was gonna say obnoxious.

07:33.106 --> 07:33.882
That too.

07:33.918 --> 07:36.863
I think Chin Chin was the one who
was aloof, obnoxious, and a biter.

07:36.898 --> 07:38.182
That's right.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.251
Oh, good. You're back.

07:41.288 --> 07:42.453
Yeah, I'm back.

07:42.536 --> 07:44.522
I went to the Sigma
Chi party without you.

07:44.555 --> 07:46.271
I was going to wait,
but I didn't know when you'd be back,

07:46.307 --> 07:48.261
so I decided to just
go ahead and do it.

07:48.297 --> 07:49.611
Well, that's fine, Paris.

07:49.647 --> 07:50.591
I know it's fine.

07:50.628 --> 07:51.803
It was on the schedule.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.601
What was I supposed to do,
stop my life because you were gone?

07:54.636 --> 07:57.011
No, but I'm glad that you went.

07:57.138 --> 07:58.512
That's great. How was it?

07:58.546 --> 08:00.942
Asinine. You didn't
miss anything.

08:00.975 --> 08:02.692
Here, I wrote a summary.

08:03.455 --> 08:05.790
And here's your mail.
I flagged your bills.

08:05.827 --> 08:07.252
Oh, thanks, Paris.

08:07.857 --> 08:10.263
So, how are you?

08:10.297 --> 08:11.601
Oh, I'm okay.

08:11.636 --> 08:13.811
- And Richard?
- Oh, he's really good.

08:13.847 --> 08:16.473
They're gonna keep him for another
night, then he should be able to
go home.

08:16.505 --> 08:18.082
It was a myocardial infarction?

08:18.118 --> 08:19.291
Yeah, a heart attack.

08:19.328 --> 08:21.470
- Is he going on beta blockers?
- I don't know.

08:21.508 --> 08:23.170
If he can tolerate them,
he should.

08:23.206 --> 08:26.401
They reduce the risk of death
following a heart attack by about 25%.

08:26.436 --> 08:28.932
Of course, he'll have to
implement a few lifestyle changes,

08:28.965 --> 08:31.573
but you tell him if Bill Clinton can
give up cheese fries and pork grits,

08:31.607 --> 08:33.403
he can get by without
his 5:00 martini.

08:33.434 --> 08:34.722
I will pass that along.

08:34.756 --> 08:35.700
Good.

08:35.736 --> 08:37.933
Anyway, I'm glad he's okay.

08:38.054 --> 08:40.360
Yeah, me too. That was scary.

08:40.397 --> 08:41.423
I'll bet.

08:41.808 --> 08:44.462
So, I downloaded your reading lists,
and I went to the bookstore

08:44.495 --> 08:47.273
and hid copies of your books so you
wouldn't get stuck buying used ones

08:47.307 --> 08:49.482
with some idiot's
comments in the margins.

08:49.515 --> 08:51.610
And here,
I made you a copy of the notes

08:51.647 --> 08:54.291
from our "History of feminism" seminar
since you missed the first class.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.300
Oh, thanks, Paris.
What's with the blacked-out section?

08:57.337 --> 09:00.333
I'm happy to share the things the
teacher said to the general public,

09:00.366 --> 09:03.002
but I'm not about to share my
insights into the material.

09:03.395 --> 09:04.723
Don't  give me that look.

09:04.756 --> 09:06.450
If there's one thing I
learned in that first lecture

09:06.486 --> 09:08.573
it's there's not room for
many women at the top.

09:08.607 --> 09:10.353
Gloria Steinem
would be so proud.

09:10.406 --> 09:12.592
Whatever. The facts
speak for themselves.

09:12.627 --> 09:14.913
Nadine Strossen is
the head of the ACLU,

09:14.946 --> 09:17.343
not Nadine Strossen and
her very best friend.

09:17.478 --> 09:19.951
Oh, we're supposed to choose
a paper topic by next friday,

09:19.988 --> 09:22.653
but I'm sure you can swing an extension
if you play the grandfather card.

09:22.688 --> 09:25.270
I will have a topic picked. I don't
need to play the grandfather card

09:25.307 --> 09:26.731
because my grandfather is fine.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.781
Okay.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.340
So, are you ready to trade?

09:29.378 --> 09:31.102
- Trade what?
- Résumés.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.391
It's on the schedule.
We're supposed to trade résumés today

09:33.426 --> 09:35.802
and get back to each other by tomorrow
morning with questions or comments.

09:35.835 --> 09:36.850
I forgot.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.920
I've been at the
hospital for two days.

09:38.956 --> 09:40.811
So much for not playing
the grandfather card.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.571
No, there's no card.

09:42.605 --> 09:44.571
I  just mean that I haven't
gotten around to it.

09:44.605 --> 09:46.431
I will get you my
résumé by tomorrow.

09:46.466 --> 09:49.882
Fine. By "résumé" you
mean "résumés," right?

09:49.915 --> 09:50.982
How many do we need?

09:51.015 --> 09:52.853
I have 21 versions,

09:52.886 --> 09:56.101
each one tailored to a particular
job in a particular field --

09:56.137 --> 09:58.291
grad school,
law school, med school,

09:58.326 --> 10:00.162
fellowships, jobs
on newspapers,

10:00.197 --> 10:01.850
jobs on the business
side of newspapers,

10:01.887 --> 10:03.853
jobs working for
multimedia conglomerations,

10:03.886 --> 10:06.070
jobs working for
"the little guy,"

10:06.107 --> 10:09.211
jobs in the public sector, i.e.
internships in Washington,

10:09.246 --> 10:11.482
for which there are three different
versions based on whether or not

10:11.515 --> 10:14.782
I'm applying to work for a democrat,
a republican, or a Joe Lieberman.

10:14.818 --> 10:17.423
Wow. When did this get here?

10:17.457 --> 10:19.161
Yesterday. Anyway,
like I was saying,

10:19.198 --> 10:21.900
it's important to tailor your
résumés to your potential employers.

10:21.938 --> 10:24.471
You think Harvard law school is
looking for the same skill set as Nasa?

10:24.508 --> 10:26.143
Probably not. Funnily enough,

10:26.177 --> 10:28.843
neither Harvard law school
nor Nasa are on my list.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.502
So, I'll get you my
résumés tonight.

10:31.685 --> 10:35.663
Oh, look, it's from Logan --
second-semester senior survival kit.

10:35.695 --> 10:38.950
There's a datebook
and a stress ball,

10:38.985 --> 10:42.012
a magnetic poetry kit,
bags and bags of coffee beans,

10:42.047 --> 10:44.212
something called an
inspirational marble keepsake

10:44.247 --> 10:46.963
with the words "anything's
possible" engraved on it.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.211
Don't worry.
I'll keep it in my room.

10:51.326 --> 10:53.650
Oh! This is a beer funnel.

10:53.685 --> 10:55.252
I saw one at the
party last night.

10:58.097 --> 10:59.652
Logan, thank you.

10:59.687 --> 11:00.833
You got the package?

11:00.866 --> 11:04.280
Yeah, finally someone gave me
an inspirational keepsake.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.481
Are you inspired?
Next year, baby, anything's possible.

11:07.518 --> 11:10.053
Yeah, I hear you loud
and clear and heavy.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.643
Good, because the
world is your oyster,

11:11.646 --> 11:13.851
to quote the other inspirational
keepsake I was considering.

11:13.886 --> 11:15.951
So how's it being back?
How are you doing? You doing okay?

11:15.987 --> 11:17.191
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:17.226 --> 11:18.861
Because if you want me
to come up tonight...

11:18.896 --> 11:20.393
No, I'll see you on sunday.

11:20.426 --> 11:21.933
Okay, but if you
change your mind...

11:21.968 --> 11:22.892
You'll be here.

11:22.925 --> 11:24.743
Logan, I cannot
thank you enough.

11:24.776 --> 11:27.721
You've just been really great
throughout this whole thing.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.250
No way.
You don't get to thank me for that.

11:29.287 --> 11:30.592
It comes with the territory.

11:30.627 --> 11:32.483
Rory, my 10:00
coffee just showed.

11:32.516 --> 11:34.742
Go. I've got a 10:00
cereal waiting for me.

11:34.775 --> 11:36.603
- I'll call you later?
- Sounds good.

11:36.635 --> 11:38.473
- I love you.
- You, too.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.012
What's with the gooney look?

11:43.437 --> 11:46.330
Your face.
It's right out of a Harlequin romance.

11:46.366 --> 11:47.650
He's just been so great.

11:47.688 --> 11:49.990
I mean, he's really been there
for me for the past couple days.

11:50.028 --> 11:52.782
I had to practically send him
away from the hospital yesterday.

11:52.815 --> 11:55.930
I know. It's amazing. I never
thought you guys were gonna last.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.791
- What?
- I'm just being honest.

11:57.825 --> 11:59.123
Logan Huntzberger?

11:59.156 --> 12:02.262
Between the women and the drinking, that
kid was on the Colin Farrell freeway

12:02.298 --> 12:04.531
about to pull over into the
Robert Downey Jr. rest stop.

12:04.566 --> 12:05.593
I get it, Paris.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.833
What I'm trying to say is,
he's changed.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.651
You changed him. It's amazing.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.331
I'm rarely this wrong.

12:11.425 --> 12:12.512
Well, thanks.

12:12.547 --> 12:13.763
Don't get me wrong.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.782
Doyle was quite the ladies' man,
as well.

12:15.816 --> 12:17.992
Now, he's down for the count.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.931
The other night, he wanted to play
"Let's think up baby names" in bed.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.490
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:22.525 --> 12:25.100
I mean, let's face it.
We took two wild stallions,

12:25.136 --> 12:26.122
and we broke them.

12:26.158 --> 12:27.952
I don't think I
really "broke" Logan.

12:27.988 --> 12:29.203
Oh, you broke him.

12:29.238 --> 12:30.410
You broke him hard.

12:30.447 --> 12:32.561
You can open the gate,
and he's not going to bolt.

12:32.597 --> 12:35.161
You can kick him with a spur,
and he's not going to spook.

12:35.198 --> 12:36.321
You own him.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.490
Paris, stop. That's ridiculous.

12:38.726 --> 12:40.783
I think I'm gonna go
work on my résumés.

12:40.818 --> 12:42.722
Hey, let's make them go
out and get tattoos.

12:42.758 --> 12:44.352
It'll be like we branded them.

12:44.616 --> 12:47.890
It says here "12% sales
tax." And that is?

12:47.926 --> 12:50.420
The percentage of sales tax the
state of Connecticut mandates.

12:50.457 --> 12:51.563
I know. It's outrageous.

12:51.598 --> 12:52.840
Harold, I've already
paid the bill.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.131
And this is the room rate.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.513
Times three nights. Yep.

12:55.548 --> 12:59.060
Okay, and what is this charge for,
exactly, under room service?

12:59.096 --> 13:02.022
That's... for the room
service that you ordered.

13:02.058 --> 13:03.462
Would you like to
see an itemized copy?

13:03.497 --> 13:04.763
- No.
- Yes.

13:04.797 --> 13:07.443
That's it. I'm leaving.
Thank you for your patience.

13:07.476 --> 13:08.650
No problem.

13:08.686 --> 13:10.492
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.792
Thank you. Bye.

13:11.827 --> 13:14.020
- So, are you ready to talk?
- Oh, sure.

13:14.055 --> 13:15.323
Let's go to the library.

13:15.358 --> 13:16.402
Okay.

13:19.307 --> 13:21.020
Please sit down.

13:25.938 --> 13:29.682
Okay, I'm ready to hear
your ideas for the funeral.

13:30.746 --> 13:33.400
Okay. Um... gosh, our ideas.

13:33.436 --> 13:35.713
Well, we've got so many ideas.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.770
So, so many.

13:37.805 --> 13:41.241
Why don't you start with,
uh, the ideas?

13:41.277 --> 13:44.633
Okay. Um, well,
first of all, we thought

13:44.665 --> 13:46.992
- we'd put him in a box.
- A box?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.273
- A bag?
- A bag?

13:48.307 --> 13:51.002
Sorry,  animal disposal is
not my area of expertise.

13:51.448 --> 13:53.912
Chin Chin has been cremated
at the animal hospital.

13:53.947 --> 13:57.082
After the memorial, his ashes will
be scattered under the poplar tree

13:57.116 --> 14:00.452
behind my house where he
so often went to think.

14:00.487 --> 14:02.250
Oh, okay. Cool.

14:02.305 --> 14:04.010
A tree. That's nice.

14:04.045 --> 14:07.230
Why don't you talk me through
the particulars of the event?

14:07.267 --> 14:08.703
Right. Okay.

14:09.278 --> 14:13.032
Well, we, uh,
thought we would have it here.

14:13.307 --> 14:14.573
That sounds good.

14:14.608 --> 14:16.950
- Okay. During lunch.
- During lunch?

14:16.987 --> 14:18.970
- Or before lunch.
- Or after lunch.

14:19.005 --> 14:21.161
Either way. Before or after lunch.
Doesn't matter.

14:21.198 --> 14:22.830
Why must it relate
to lunch at all?

14:22.865 --> 14:26.312
It doesn't have to. We were just
using lunch as a measure of time.

14:26.346 --> 14:27.971
A way to break up the day.

14:28.005 --> 14:29.330
Yes, totally arbitrary.

14:29.366 --> 14:31.521
I was thinking twilight
might be nice.

14:31.558 --> 14:34.220
Great. Well, then 5:00 it is.

14:34.257 --> 14:36.873
That's a wonderful... idea.

14:36.908 --> 14:40.221
Sookie, what else
was on our list?

14:40.256 --> 14:41.561
Do you have yours with you?

14:41.595 --> 14:43.831
I don't. Sorry.

14:43.866 --> 14:47.463
I left mine with yours, so...

14:47.497 --> 14:48.992
The flowers.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.382
Oh, that was the first
thing on our list.

14:51.416 --> 14:52.962
There will definitely
be flowers.

14:52.996 --> 14:54.972
I was thinking gerber
daisies would be nice,

14:55.008 --> 14:58.692
maybe in red, yellows,
oranges to complement his fur.

14:58.725 --> 14:59.650
Done and done.

14:59.688 --> 15:01.613
Can I trust you to
liaise with the florist?

15:01.647 --> 15:03.541
I'll liaise with the florist.

15:03.577 --> 15:05.621
Let's discuss the programs.

15:05.978 --> 15:08.050
- The programs.
- You want programs?

15:08.088 --> 15:10.892
Do you think when the Princess
of Wales was interred at Althorp

15:10.928 --> 15:14.683
the Spencer family was asked
whether or not they wanted programs?

15:14.715 --> 15:15.581
Probably not.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.052
I assume there are no stationery
selections for me to choose from yet.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.610
- Not yet.
- You know what, who cares?

15:20.647 --> 15:22.271
Why don't we just
use fax paper?

15:22.308 --> 15:24.230
And why not print them
out on the computer?

15:24.266 --> 15:26.400
After all, it's just a dog.

15:26.637 --> 15:29.882
Hey, Michel,
don't worry about the programs, okay?

15:29.917 --> 15:32.650
We'll make up something
really nice for you.

15:33.138 --> 15:33.940
Fine.

15:35.136 --> 15:37.823
Here's the picture I'd
like to use for the cover.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.571
Aw, well, isn't that cute?

15:40.605 --> 15:42.911
Oh, yeah. Cute.

15:42.948 --> 15:44.643
Shall we go over the menus?

15:44.675 --> 15:47.300
Ah, the menus.
Well, Sookie, take it away.

15:47.336 --> 15:49.153
Oh! Hey. Stay.

15:49.188 --> 15:51.002
I'd love your input.

15:51.035 --> 15:53.630
You've always let me know that when
it comes to food, you're the boss.

15:53.665 --> 15:55.802
Well, you're the boss.

16:01.145 --> 16:03.453
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:04.796 --> 16:06.843
I guess we should talk.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.203
I guess we should.

16:08.285 --> 16:09.383
Crudités?

16:09.418 --> 16:10.523
Not here. Come on.

16:10.555 --> 16:13.311
If your child died,
would you serve crudités?

16:13.348 --> 16:15.550
Hey, can my children
not be your go-to?!

16:21.185 --> 16:22.513
Okay, go. Talk.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.822
Well, obviously we
have some issues.

16:24.857 --> 16:27.411
Issues? What issues?
We got in a fight and you took off.

16:27.448 --> 16:29.202
- I was mad.
- Oh, you were mad.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.470
Then never mind.
You should have left.

16:30.506 --> 16:32.441
- Don't be sarcastic.
- Don't tell me what to do,

16:32.475 --> 16:35.611
not when I wake up on the morning after
we have a fight and you've disappeared.

16:35.648 --> 16:38.432
- I needed some space.
- Oh, you needed space?

16:38.466 --> 16:41.191
We're married. You need space,
you walk around the block,

16:41.225 --> 16:42.873
you go get a beer.
You don't take off.

16:42.905 --> 16:44.501
My father was in the hospital.
You weren't there.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.633
I turned my phone off after the fight.
I was upset.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.921
I came as soon as I heard.

16:47.958 --> 16:51.002
Yeah, you came and then you stayed
for an hour and then you left again.

16:51.038 --> 16:53.522
I didn't feel like staying much
when I saw who else was there.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.903
I didn't ask Luke to come.

16:54.938 --> 16:56.412
You didn't ask him
to leave, either.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.202
No, I didn't. He's my friend.

16:58.238 --> 16:59.543
He brought food.
You weren't there!

16:59.575 --> 17:01.811
I was there. I saw your dad.
I checked in.

17:01.847 --> 17:04.103
"Checked in." I'm not
the 6:40 to Buffalo.

17:04.135 --> 17:06.213
I'm sorry.
I'm sick of seeing that guy.

17:06.248 --> 17:07.593
How do you think I feel?

17:07.626 --> 17:10.079
For two days,
I'm in that hospital 18 hours a day.

17:10.117 --> 17:11.622
I didn't even know if
you were coming back.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.800
- I needed time.
- I needed you.

17:13.835 --> 17:14.791
Lor...

17:14.828 --> 17:16.592
You know what the
worst part of it was?

17:16.627 --> 17:20.170
When you weren't there,
part of me wasn't surprised.

17:21.856 --> 17:23.220
That's not fair.

17:24.088 --> 17:26.903
I can't do this now.
I have a million things to get done.

17:26.936 --> 17:28.181
I just -- I can't.

17:28.217 --> 17:30.471
- So, when?
- I don't know. Later.

17:38.347 --> 17:41.981
Okay. Well, then,
you're all set for the 16th.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.751
- Hang on.
- Hanging.

17:44.005 --> 17:45.383
Yes, sir.

17:45.578 --> 17:48.441
Well, that's wonderful.
We're looking forward to it. Thank you.

17:48.495 --> 17:49.753
Okay, bye.

17:49.787 --> 17:50.763
Hi, hon.

17:50.798 --> 17:52.872
Quick, get me into a
microeconomic mood.

17:52.906 --> 17:57.282
Uh, okay. Supply and demand,
profit margin, pork bellies.

17:57.317 --> 17:58.681
You had me till pork bellies.

17:58.718 --> 18:00.682
You're going to grandpa's
class sans grandpa?

18:00.716 --> 18:02.410
Yes, and I'm kind
of dreading it.

18:02.445 --> 18:05.021
I only signed up for this class
because grandpa was teaching it.

18:05.057 --> 18:06.783
I'm not naturally econ crazy.

18:06.815 --> 18:08.860
Is anyone really econ crazy?

18:08.897 --> 18:10.733
Oh, yeah.
First thing I learned last semester.

18:10.747 --> 18:13.610
People find the gross national
product endlessly fascinating.

18:13.645 --> 18:14.751
Weird.

18:14.787 --> 18:15.880
Blew my mind.

18:15.918 --> 18:18.360
So, how's your
re-immersion going?

18:18.395 --> 18:20.572
Pretty good,
loving the non-fluorescent lighting,

18:20.606 --> 18:23.171
although I miss eating my
meals out of a vending machine.

18:23.206 --> 18:24.022
How are you doing?

18:24.055 --> 18:24.963
Not bad.

18:24.997 --> 18:27.853
Logan got me a marble plaque,
and Paris hid books. It was sweet.

18:27.885 --> 18:29.511
All right,
must be a generational thing.

18:29.547 --> 18:32.072
Must be. Any word from dad?
Latte, please.

18:32.306 --> 18:36.113
Um... yes, actually.
He just came by the Inn.

18:36.145 --> 18:37.700
- He did?
- A couple hours ago.

18:37.738 --> 18:39.533
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know,

18:39.567 --> 18:41.963
he said he's been
needing some space.

18:41.998 --> 18:44.523
That's ridiculous.
He hasn't been home in two days.

18:44.558 --> 18:47.750
He was upset about the letter, then he
saw Luke at the hospital, you know?

18:47.787 --> 18:49.572
So what if he saw
Luke at the hospital?

18:49.607 --> 18:50.892
He should have been
there for you.

18:50.925 --> 18:52.350
He was. He came.

18:52.388 --> 18:53.943
Yeah, but then he left.

18:53.977 --> 18:56.410
Honey, look,
don't be mad at your dad, okay?

18:56.446 --> 18:58.321
It's a complicated situation.

18:58.358 --> 19:00.070
Mom, stop it.
I'm not Switzerland.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.941
- What?
- I'm on your side.

19:02.377 --> 19:04.490
I don't want you to take sides.

19:04.528 --> 19:06.211
Look, I'm not a
kid anymore, okay?

19:06.245 --> 19:08.501
I get to have an opinion,
and I get to pick a side.

19:08.536 --> 19:09.943
And I'm on your side,
like it or not.

19:09.977 --> 19:10.800
Okay.

19:10.837 --> 19:13.360
It's not just because you're
right and he's wrong.

19:13.396 --> 19:15.891
I'm on your side,
no matter what.

19:15.926 --> 19:17.692
No matter what?

19:17.726 --> 19:21.780
I mean, even if I cut off all your
hair while you were sleeping,

19:21.816 --> 19:23.363
would you still be
on my side then?

19:23.396 --> 19:24.142
Yep.

19:24.178 --> 19:27.010
What if I signed you up for a
camping trip and made you go?

19:27.045 --> 19:27.841
Even then.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.812
What if I put a secret clause on
your birth certificate that says

19:29.845 --> 19:32.473
when you turn 23,
your name changes to Hildegarde?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.673
There's no such thing as a
birth-certificate clause.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.970
- I had a really good lawyer.
- Even then.

19:37.007 --> 19:38.281
Oh, good to know.

19:38.516 --> 19:40.723
So, talk to me.
How are you feeling?

19:40.756 --> 19:43.643
Oh, good. Fine. Medium.

19:43.678 --> 19:46.011
You know, rare --
medium rare. Rare.

19:46.048 --> 19:47.240
More like sashimi.

19:47.277 --> 19:48.191
Yeah?

19:48.227 --> 19:50.952
It's scary, you know?
Your dad, um...

19:51.137 --> 19:52.730
tends to...

19:52.996 --> 19:56.193
avoid conflict when
things get complicated.

19:56.226 --> 19:58.313
Did you tell him that?
You should tell him that.

19:58.345 --> 19:59.170
I did.

19:59.205 --> 20:00.473
I mean, I tried.

20:00.508 --> 20:02.982
I was mad.
I told him we'd talk later.

20:03.017 --> 20:04.732
Well, you can call me
after you talk to him.

20:04.765 --> 20:06.973
I'm sure you guys will work
everything out, but...

20:07.005 --> 20:08.553
you can call me if
you need anything.

20:08.586 --> 20:10.203
Yeah. I got you on speed dial.

20:10.236 --> 20:11.711
Really? You programmed
your speed dial?

20:11.747 --> 20:14.010
No. It's
metaphorically speaking.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.562
I can dial really fast, though.

20:15.598 --> 20:17.421
Got you.
Okay, I'm gonna run into class.

20:17.458 --> 20:18.723
Okay, hon. Sounds good.

20:18.757 --> 20:20.890
- Okay, peace out, yo.
- Bye, Hilde.

20:24.235 --> 20:25.690
- Hey, Rory.
- Hey.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.470
- Good to see you.
- Rory Gilmore?

20:28.275 --> 20:30.241
Heard your name.
Just want to introduce myself.

20:30.278 --> 20:32.221
Tucker Culbertson,
filling in for your grandfather

20:32.255 --> 20:33.770
until he's well
enough to come back.

20:34.706 --> 20:37.661
Well, hello,
professor Culbertson.

20:37.696 --> 20:38.821
Thanks for the promotion.

20:38.856 --> 20:40.912
I'm not a professor yet.
I'm just a T.A.

20:40.947 --> 20:43.101
Oh. Uh, sorry --

20:43.395 --> 20:47.052
not that you're a T.A.,
just that I called you --

20:47.087 --> 20:49.873
- Um, I'm Rory.
- I know.

20:50.306 --> 20:51.603
Right.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.981
So, how's he doing?

20:53.045 --> 20:54.871
Great. Thanks.

20:54.907 --> 20:57.030
I'm glad.
I heard he's a terrific lecturer.

20:57.068 --> 20:59.061
Oh, yeah, the best --

20:59.097 --> 21:02.033
well, in my entirely
biased opinion.

21:02.065 --> 21:04.602
I'm with you. I can't believe
this is his first year teaching.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.521
He really put together a great syllabus.
I'm looking forward to getting into it.

21:07.558 --> 21:08.760
Me too.

21:09.148 --> 21:10.340
Well, it's nice to
meet you, Rory.

21:10.377 --> 21:12.050
Yeah, well, good luck.

21:12.085 --> 21:16.202
Oh, I mean,
not that you need it or anything.

21:16.367 --> 21:18.012
Okay, bye.

21:27.005 --> 21:28.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.220
Sorry I'm late.
It was busy at work.

21:31.256 --> 21:32.411
That's okay.

21:32.446 --> 21:34.943
I hope you don't mind.
I saw you were using three of them,

21:34.978 --> 21:37.290
so I thought I'd program
your universal remote.

21:37.325 --> 21:38.453
Thanks.

21:38.486 --> 21:40.833
- Want some coffee?
- No, I'm okay...

21:41.186 --> 21:43.630
- Unless you want some.
- No, I'm okay.

21:45.958 --> 21:48.931
- So, uh...
- So, uh...

21:50.195 --> 21:52.433
I've been thinking
about things, and...

21:52.467 --> 21:54.321
you're right.
I shouldn't have taken off.

21:54.357 --> 21:55.361
No, you shouldn't have.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.251
But you got to understand,
Lor, that letter --

21:57.285 --> 21:59.220
- Ugh. "Character reference."
- Whatever.

21:59.257 --> 22:00.761
No, not whatever.

22:00.795 --> 22:03.183
There's a big difference between a
letter and a character reference.

22:03.218 --> 22:05.283
I had to write that stuff
for Luke for a judge

22:05.315 --> 22:06.991
so he could get
custody of his kid.

22:07.027 --> 22:08.042
- Don't do that.
- What?

22:08.076 --> 22:09.460
Make me think this
is all in my head.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.460
- It is!
- It's not!

22:10.498 --> 22:12.922
- I see the way you look at him.
- Stop.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.801
I chose you. I married you.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.851
- It's not that simple.
- What else is there?

22:16.886 --> 22:18.842
- Stuff! There's other stuff.
- Like what?

22:18.876 --> 22:20.920
I got into a fight
with the guy, Lor.

22:20.956 --> 22:22.040
What?

22:22.248 --> 22:25.151
About a month ago at the gazebo,
I just walked up to him.

22:25.186 --> 22:27.221
We started whaling
on each other.

22:27.257 --> 22:28.542
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

22:28.575 --> 22:30.792
It's not something
I'm exactly proud of.

22:30.825 --> 22:32.973
This is what it's come to --
I'm fighting the guy in the street.

22:33.006 --> 22:35.573
Isn't that the kind of thing
you would tell a person?

22:35.607 --> 22:38.731
I mean, I could help.
I could have been more sensitive.

22:38.768 --> 22:40.490
It's not just about
the fight, Lor.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.502
I should have given you more time.
You asked me to.

22:42.537 --> 22:44.523
I said I would. I didn't.

22:44.555 --> 22:45.520
No, Chris.

22:45.558 --> 22:47.942
You were vulnerable,
and I pushed you.

22:47.977 --> 22:50.441
And I think it's because we
always had this timing issue.

22:50.476 --> 22:53.331
We were too young,
and then Sherry got pregnant.

22:53.365 --> 22:55.071
You were with him and --

22:55.125 --> 22:57.053
I don't know.
I saw this opportunity, and I thought,

22:57.086 --> 22:59.393
"now, we should do this now
while we have the chance,

22:59.428 --> 23:01.743
while you're free and clear."
But you weren't. You're not.

23:01.766 --> 23:02.810
Yes, I am!

23:02.847 --> 23:06.522
You were engaged to him, Lor.
You needed time to -- to disengage.

23:06.557 --> 23:08.393
Stop. That's not what this is.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.923
We're together now.
Maybe we did rush into it,

23:10.955 --> 23:13.343
but we can work this out.

23:14.908 --> 23:16.703
I don't think we can.

23:18.177 --> 23:19.611
What does that mean?

23:19.646 --> 23:20.943
You're giving up?

23:20.976 --> 23:22.750
I don't know what else to do.

23:22.788 --> 23:25.212
There's lots else to do.
We can work on this.

23:25.246 --> 23:27.081
Work on what?
Work on you thinking that I'm the man

23:27.116 --> 23:28.621
you want to spend the
rest of your life with?

23:28.656 --> 23:30.892
I've been asking you to marry me
for 20 years. We're finally married.

23:30.928 --> 23:32.890
I still feel like
I'm asking you.

23:33.307 --> 23:34.601
That's terrible.

23:35.136 --> 23:37.331
I'm sorry if you feel that way,

23:37.368 --> 23:39.130
if I made you feel that way.

23:39.657 --> 23:42.322
That's not how I feel.
I'm in this.

23:43.107 --> 23:44.621
I want to believe that.

23:44.658 --> 23:46.750
You should. It's true.

23:51.978 --> 23:54.680
Look, I should probably
get back to my mom's.

23:54.718 --> 23:56.603
G.G.'s been there all day.

23:56.955 --> 23:59.482
Yeah, you should be with her.
How is she?

24:00.535 --> 24:03.080
She's fine. She's good.

24:05.746 --> 24:07.352
So, we'll talk more tomorrow?

24:08.335 --> 24:10.131
Okay. Yeah.

24:21.497 --> 24:23.771
Lorelai, I specifically
sent out a memo

24:23.807 --> 24:26.070
asking that all
pillows featuring cats

24:26.106 --> 24:27.762
- be removed from the library.
- What?

24:27.796 --> 24:28.993
The cat pillows --
they're still there!

24:29.025 --> 24:30.802
Ah, yeah, I'll take care of it,
I promise.

24:30.835 --> 24:32.581
- And you have to talk to Sookie.
- What about?

24:32.615 --> 24:34.233
I asked her about
the final menu.

24:34.268 --> 24:36.423
She said she didn't have it yet.
I said "when can I expect it?"

24:36.455 --> 24:39.201
She said she wasn't sure. I said,
"might I ask what you are planning?"

24:39.237 --> 24:40.800
And she said -- and I quote --

24:40.836 --> 24:43.190
"let's see what's left over
at the end of the day,

24:43.226 --> 24:45.230
and I'll whip up
something delicious."

24:45.365 --> 24:47.650
Leftovers! Why even bother?

24:47.888 --> 24:51.090
Is it too much to ask that
the passing of my beloved dog

24:51.127 --> 24:53.463
be marked by food that has
been prepared specifically

24:53.497 --> 24:54.800
with that occasion in mind?

24:54.837 --> 24:56.683
I'm sure the food
will be wonderful.

24:56.997 --> 24:58.423
Have you called
about the flowers?

24:58.456 --> 25:00.351
- I was just about to.
- Lorelai.

25:00.386 --> 25:02.023
Grayson's only needs
a 2-hour heads up.

25:02.055 --> 25:04.433
At least do you have a
program for me to approve?

25:04.468 --> 25:05.822
Uh, not yet, but I will.

25:05.858 --> 25:08.710
- The funeral is tonight.
- I'm well aware of that.

25:08.746 --> 25:11.011
- Then why has nothing been done?
- Plenty has been done.

25:11.046 --> 25:13.760
No! Nothing has been done.
You are putting no effort into --

25:13.795 --> 25:15.100
Michel, back off.

25:15.136 --> 25:17.091
I happen to have a few other
things on my mind right now,

25:17.127 --> 25:19.063
so forgive me if I haven't
put all of my energy

25:19.096 --> 25:21.292
into focusing on
your dog funeral.

25:22.927 --> 25:27.131
I apologize that my loss has come
at an inopportune time for you.

25:27.166 --> 25:29.352
I will try to schedule
the next death

25:29.387 --> 25:31.442
when it is more convenient.

25:34.927 --> 25:37.912
Let's see -- "Gender trouble,"
Judith Butler. It should be here.

25:37.948 --> 25:39.021
Are you sure this is
where you hid it?

25:39.058 --> 25:41.052
Of course.
I had an aunt Judy who loved to travel,

25:41.088 --> 25:42.220
hence the travel section.

25:42.258 --> 25:44.630
Then I used my standard
covert alphabetizing system

25:44.667 --> 25:46.820
using the third letter of
the author's last name, "T,"

25:46.836 --> 25:49.211
followed by the third letter of
the author's first name, "D."

25:49.246 --> 25:52.432
So it should be right here,
after Tabin but before Thoreau.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.880
I don't understand
why it's not here.

25:53.917 --> 25:56.093
Okay, I'm gonna go check the
women's studies section again,

25:56.127 --> 25:58.240
see if I can find a used copy,
just in case.

25:58.278 --> 26:00.400
Wait a minute.
This whole shelf is a mess.

26:00.436 --> 26:02.891
Why is Congwen Shen
before Tony Griffiths?

26:02.927 --> 26:04.491
Excuse me. You.

26:04.526 --> 26:06.441
Come over here and
explain yourself.

26:11.988 --> 26:12.911
Rory.

26:13.325 --> 26:14.833
Oh. Hey.

26:14.997 --> 26:16.721
- How you doing?
- Good, thanks.

26:16.756 --> 26:19.242
I'm glad.
I wanted to thank you.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.161
Seems you gave me a
pretty good evaluation.

26:21.197 --> 26:21.852
What?

26:21.885 --> 26:23.351
I got a call from
your grandfather.

26:23.387 --> 26:24.663
I think he was
talking about class,

26:24.698 --> 26:27.521
unless you happened to see the econ
grad students take out the comp.

26:27.557 --> 26:29.090
Lit grad students in
ultimate frisbee.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.993
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
I'm a little all over the place.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.470
New semester, you know.

26:33.506 --> 26:36.140
I just wanted to thank you.
It's always nice to get good feedback.

26:36.156 --> 26:37.773
- No problem.
- See you around.

26:37.808 --> 26:38.893
Okay.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.082
That -- That's a good book.

26:42.866 --> 26:44.993
- Which one?
- Um, "Eva luna."

26:45.025 --> 26:47.451
Everyone loves "House of the
spirits," but I just think "Eva luna"

26:47.485 --> 26:48.873
is Allende's best work.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.661
Cool. I'm looking
forward to reading it.

26:50.696 --> 26:51.950
Yeah, me too.

26:52.626 --> 26:54.351
Oh, for you to read it.

26:55.028 --> 26:56.373
I'll see you around.

26:56.407 --> 26:57.553
Bye, Rory.

26:58.376 --> 27:00.832
Where were you? The women's
studies section is over there.

27:00.965 --> 27:02.952
Um, yeah, I was on my way.

27:03.197 --> 27:04.140
The book's gone.

27:04.177 --> 27:06.683
Apparently, they redid the travel
section and alphabetized it

27:06.717 --> 27:08.622
according to destination
instead of author.

27:08.655 --> 27:10.813
I ripped the salesman a new one,
but it was too late.

27:11.126 --> 27:13.291
Hey. What's wrong with you?

27:13.326 --> 27:13.993
What?

27:14.027 --> 27:15.203
You're all red and blotchy.

27:15.236 --> 27:16.352
Oh, am I?

27:16.397 --> 27:18.893
It's probably just 'cause
I'm a bit warm in here.

27:19.395 --> 27:20.420
So you found it?

27:20.457 --> 27:22.491
No. Weren't you listening?

27:22.527 --> 27:25.902
Here. It's used, but luckily,
the previous owner was a dimwit slacker

27:25.937 --> 27:27.300
who only made it
through chapter one.

27:27.337 --> 27:28.580
Oh, great.

27:29.638 --> 27:30.682
That's good.

27:32.236 --> 27:33.352
Flower delivery.

27:33.857 --> 27:34.782
Kirk?

27:34.818 --> 27:36.783
Oh, I didn't know you
worked for Grayson's.

27:36.815 --> 27:39.090
Oh, no, I don't work there.
I'm volunteering.

27:39.127 --> 27:40.283
How... noble.

27:40.317 --> 27:42.992
Yeah, I just thought it was
time to give something back.

27:43.025 --> 27:44.210
Here's your bill.

27:44.248 --> 27:47.033
It's a little high because we
had to do a little airbrushing.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.723
Small blemish on the nose.

27:48.758 --> 27:52.232
Probably wasn't visible to the naked
eye, but when we blew the picture up --

27:52.266 --> 27:53.611
- Wow.
- Sounds great.

27:53.645 --> 27:56.093
I got stuff to take care of.
Bring the rest of the flowers in?

27:56.128 --> 27:57.433
Sure thing.

27:58.815 --> 28:00.493
I don't want to
embarrass you, but

28:00.525 --> 28:02.743
it is customary to
tip the deliveryman.

28:02.776 --> 28:03.970
I thought you
were volunteering.

28:04.007 --> 28:05.223
Not for you.

28:05.257 --> 28:07.660
Ask Rob at the front desk.
He's got the petty cash.

28:08.648 --> 28:11.003
Hey, Christy,
will we see you tonight at the memorial?

28:11.037 --> 28:12.832
- Actually, I don't think --
- Let me rephrase that.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.702
We'll see you tonight at the memorial.
Attendance is mandatory. Thanks.

28:17.295 --> 28:19.301
- How's the food coming?
- Hey!

28:19.336 --> 28:21.722
I've got a walnut arugula
gorgonzola croustini,

28:21.758 --> 28:24.551
a little caraway cornbread
with apricots, bacon,

28:24.587 --> 28:26.481
and a little jalapeño jam,

28:26.515 --> 28:29.182
beef tenderloin chiffonade
in little focaccia rounds,

28:29.217 --> 28:31.182
and -- oh! --
sweet potato biscuits

28:31.215 --> 28:33.742
with pork tenderloin and
a little apple chutney.

28:33.778 --> 28:34.762
- Wow.
- Yeah.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.551
Some of my finest work all
wasted on a dog funeral

28:37.585 --> 28:38.962
and a petty little man.

28:38.997 --> 28:40.821
Well, he said some
things he didn't mean.

28:40.858 --> 28:42.472
You don't go after
someone's children.

28:42.508 --> 28:46.093
He's going through a very rough time,
and he really will appreciate all
of this.

28:46.126 --> 28:48.652
I know. I made him
some fat-free brownies, too.

28:48.687 --> 28:50.270
I know. I'm a softy.

28:50.306 --> 28:51.961
And the whole kitchen staff's
gonna be there, right?

28:51.997 --> 28:53.650
Those who value
their jobs will be.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.302
I pulled out my "don't
mess with me" face,

28:55.337 --> 28:57.122
which I use on the
kids all the time.

28:57.157 --> 28:59.621
I'll be damned if they don't
hop to and brush those teeth.

28:59.658 --> 29:01.903
Good, I want a full house,
and if they have minty-fresh breath,

29:01.936 --> 29:03.122
that's just a plus.

29:03.155 --> 29:05.502
They'll be there --
not that Michel will say thank you

29:05.538 --> 29:08.802
or modify his behavior in any
way to show that he's grateful,

29:08.837 --> 29:11.813
but just so you know,
you're doing a really nice thing.

29:11.848 --> 29:14.312
Well, thanks.
I feel bad about snapping at him.

29:14.345 --> 29:16.590
You have a lot on your mind.
Want a brownie?

29:16.628 --> 29:17.951
Mm, no, thanks.

29:17.988 --> 29:20.261
Um, so,
I talked to Christopher.

29:20.297 --> 29:21.742
Wait. Get out.

29:22.276 --> 29:23.590
You're doing a
great job, though!

29:23.596 --> 29:24.933
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Keep it up.

29:25.515 --> 29:26.523
Go.

29:27.076 --> 29:29.010
I talked to Christopher.
I was really mad.

29:29.047 --> 29:30.490
But you were able
to work it out.

29:30.525 --> 29:33.040
We're working on working it out.
He thinks I don't want to be in it.

29:33.077 --> 29:35.520
He thinks that I don't even
want to be in this marriage.

29:35.558 --> 29:37.673
- But you do, right?
- Of course I do.

29:37.708 --> 29:38.630
Yeah, that's what I thought.

29:38.665 --> 29:40.230
It's this Luke thing.

29:40.268 --> 29:42.880
Christopher's jealousy
is blinding him,

29:42.915 --> 29:46.272
and I've been racking my brain to
think of a way to convince him

29:46.308 --> 29:48.053
that I twant to be
in this marriage.

29:48.085 --> 29:51.521
And I think the only way is if I
cut Luke out of my life entirely.

29:51.558 --> 29:52.461
No Luke at all.

29:52.497 --> 29:54.563
No, I mean,
it wouldn't be that big a difference.

29:54.596 --> 29:57.493
It's not like I see
him a lot as it is.

29:57.527 --> 30:00.660
Well, that's true, although just
because you don't see him a lot

30:00.696 --> 30:03.223
doesn't mean he's not a
big part of your life.

30:03.255 --> 30:05.240
Eight months ago,
you were engaged to the guy.

30:05.277 --> 30:08.110
I know. I try not to dwell on
that because I've moved on.

30:08.148 --> 30:09.800
I-I married Christopher.

30:09.835 --> 30:12.900
It's just that it's Luke.
You guys were together a long time.

30:12.937 --> 30:13.770
I know.

30:13.805 --> 30:16.643
You were friends for years
even before you were together.

30:16.677 --> 30:19.223
And then, when you were together,
you were really together.

30:19.256 --> 30:20.712
Yes. We were.

30:20.748 --> 30:23.251
So all I'm saying is that
you broke up with Luke

30:23.285 --> 30:25.091
and immediately started
dating Christopher.

30:25.128 --> 30:27.093
And I know you're over it,
and I know you've moved on,

30:27.126 --> 30:31.070
but all those feelings for Luke didn't
just disappear overnight, right?

30:31.107 --> 30:32.990
That's what I'm saying.
Of course they didn't.

30:33.027 --> 30:34.920
It's just,
you moved really quickly.

30:34.956 --> 30:38.303
Yes, I moved quickly to a
man I love who loves me,

30:38.335 --> 30:40.032
who wanted to marry me.

30:40.068 --> 30:42.551
When Luke and I were together,
he was kind

30:42.588 --> 30:44.602
and loyal and thoughtful.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.722
The guy built me an ice-skating rink,
for god's sake.

30:46.755 --> 30:48.032
God, I forgot about that.

30:48.065 --> 30:50.440
But he was also distant
and uncommunicative,

30:50.477 --> 30:52.343
and he didn't want to marry me.

30:52.375 --> 30:54.650
And I tried everything
I could to work it out.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.091
Of course I have
feelings for him.

30:56.127 --> 30:57.642
That's what Christopher's
responding to,

30:57.678 --> 30:59.942
and that's why,
in order to save my marriage,

30:59.977 --> 31:02.770
the only thing I can do
is cut Luke out, right?

31:02.808 --> 31:03.970
Right.

31:06.126 --> 31:08.401
I'm sorry, it's just,
I have a but.

31:08.476 --> 31:09.620
Yes?

31:10.488 --> 31:15.123
If there were no Luke -- no Luke in
the past, no Luke in the picture...

31:16.295 --> 31:17.341
Yeah?

31:17.735 --> 31:19.700
Well, would it be Christopher?

31:19.736 --> 31:21.933
Would he be "the one"?

31:27.588 --> 31:30.382
I don't even know why we are
bothering to select music.

31:30.416 --> 31:32.612
Why not just turn on the
radio and hope for the best?

31:32.646 --> 31:34.860
Maybe we'll get lucky
and a hip-hop station

31:34.895 --> 31:36.760
will be playing
Snoop Doggy Dogg.

31:36.797 --> 31:38.710
Michel, come on.
I said I'm sorry.

31:38.746 --> 31:40.192
We're gonna have a
beautiful ceremony.

31:40.225 --> 31:41.653
Look, here's Zach. Hi, Zach.

31:41.685 --> 31:43.202
Hey. Lorelai.

31:43.558 --> 31:46.660
Hello, Michel.
I'm very sorry to hear about your loss.

31:46.695 --> 31:47.912
It totally blows.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.100
Thank you.

31:49.137 --> 31:51.270
So, Zach's gonna do the
music for the ceremony.

31:51.305 --> 31:53.740
I'm psyched, dude.
At first I was thinking mandolin,

31:53.776 --> 31:55.731
but then I'm like, "whoa,
Zach, are you tripping?

31:55.758 --> 31:57.470
It's got to be the
acoustic guitar."

31:57.505 --> 31:58.953
A way more soulful sound.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.873
Have you thought about the
music for the ceremony?

32:00.905 --> 32:03.063
Yeah, I did --
vintage Bowie, originally recorded

32:03.096 --> 32:06.072
with Herbie Flowers on bass,
Aynsley Dunbar on drums.

32:06.105 --> 32:07.613
You know where I'm going?

32:07.647 --> 32:10.172
"Diamond dogs"? Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!

32:10.207 --> 32:12.090
# They call them
the diamond dogs #

32:12.127 --> 32:14.012
# Bow-wow, woof woof,
whoo-hoo! #

32:14.047 --> 32:15.373
That sounds great.

32:15.405 --> 32:17.652
We didn't need a song
that necessarily had dogs

32:17.685 --> 32:19.920
in the lyrics, right, Michel?

32:19.955 --> 32:22.650
Whatever. David Bowie
sounds like a hoot.

32:22.687 --> 32:24.863
More princess Diana, less dog.

32:24.895 --> 32:26.321
So you want Elton John?

32:26.358 --> 32:29.132
We were thinking very dignified --
Bach, Mozart.

32:29.168 --> 32:30.930
- Céline Dion.
- Or Céline Dion.

32:30.966 --> 32:32.383
Please don't make me do that.

32:32.415 --> 32:35.722
After all, "My heart will go on"
was Chin Chin's favorite song.

32:35.755 --> 32:37.980
Oh, well, then,
there you go, huh?

32:38.017 --> 32:41.780
We'll just find, uh,
"My heart." "My heart belongs to daddy,"

32:41.817 --> 32:43.810
"My heart belongs to me,"
"My heart belongs to you."

32:43.845 --> 32:45.153
My heart can't
make up its mind.

32:45.187 --> 32:47.403
How about "Tears in heaven"?
That's a wicked song.

32:47.435 --> 32:49.882
Well, "My heart is
crying for you,"

32:49.915 --> 32:51.871
"My heart is waiting,"
"My heart stood still."

32:51.905 --> 32:54.110
People very interested in
this whole heart thing.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.361
"I will always love you" --
it's got the cheese factor,

32:56.395 --> 32:58.563
but it's still at
least a legitimate --

32:58.598 --> 33:02.260
- "My heart will go on."
- Oh, good! They have it!

33:02.298 --> 33:06.052
So you get working on that,
and, uh, we'll be moving on.

33:07.895 --> 33:10.723
Okay, so,
we're all set with the music,

33:10.756 --> 33:12.960
and the rest of the flowers should
be delivered in about an hour.

33:12.995 --> 33:15.153
You got your suit from the cleaners.
All we have to do now

33:15.185 --> 33:18.392
is stop by the printer's and
approve the layout for the program.

33:18.428 --> 33:21.693
Actually, as long as we're here,
I think I'm gonna stop into Luke's.

33:21.726 --> 33:23.032
Really? Why?

33:23.066 --> 33:26.211
Do you remember last year when that
troupe of mimes took over the Inn?

33:26.246 --> 33:30.202
It was a very stressful time for me,
guessing at what they wanted,

33:30.237 --> 33:33.362
watching to see what they were pointing
at so I knew what to fetch them.

33:33.398 --> 33:36.533
When they finally left,
I needed a bit of comfort,

33:36.566 --> 33:40.690
so I stopped at Luke's
and I bought a hamburger.

33:40.726 --> 33:41.781
- You didn't.
- I know.

33:41.815 --> 33:43.551
It was a moment of insanity.

33:43.587 --> 33:45.452
Thank god by the
time I got home,

33:45.488 --> 33:48.310
I had already calculated that
it would take me 55 minutes

33:48.347 --> 33:52.340
of medium-intensity interval training on
my elliptical machine to work it off.

33:52.376 --> 33:55.571
Thought better of the whole thing and
dumped the foul thing in the trash.

33:55.607 --> 33:56.590
Close call.

33:56.625 --> 33:58.891
Yeah, extremely.
Unfortunately, Chin Chin,

33:58.925 --> 34:03.061
being the little rascal that he was,
fished it out of the garbage.

34:03.768 --> 34:06.860
After all the exotic dog
food I lavished on him --

34:06.895 --> 34:09.503
homemade biscuits,
fresh-ground lamb --

34:09.536 --> 34:13.562
It was this burger that he
seemed to enjoy the most.

34:13.597 --> 34:17.841
And today,
I will eat one in his memory.

34:17.875 --> 34:19.902
Well, what a sacrifice.

34:19.938 --> 34:21.659
Uh, go on in.
You get your burger.

34:21.697 --> 34:23.100
I'll get started
at the printer's.

34:23.137 --> 34:24.380
Sounds good.

34:24.927 --> 34:26.782
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

34:48.466 --> 34:49.992
What are you doing here?!

34:50.027 --> 34:52.112
Aw, I couldn't
wait till sunday.

34:54.416 --> 34:55.663
What's that look?

34:55.697 --> 34:58.692
Oh, Paris calls it my
Harlequin romance face.

34:58.727 --> 34:59.860
Come on in!

35:03.147 --> 35:04.923
Where is the infamous
miss Geller?

35:04.955 --> 35:07.173
Now? Let's see.

35:07.207 --> 35:11.030
This afternoon, she is belly dancing
with the Yale Belly Dance Society

35:11.065 --> 35:12.332
at the Payne Whitney gym.

35:12.367 --> 35:13.852
Wow, how'd you get out of it?

35:13.886 --> 35:17.162
I'm supposed to be at a wrestling match.
We're supposed to trade notes later.

35:17.195 --> 35:18.400
Use the term "half nelson."

35:18.437 --> 35:20.252
I'll use the term "whole
nelson." I'm not afraid.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.460
Yeah, don't do that.

35:25.077 --> 35:27.371
Logan, um,
I have to talk to you.

35:27.407 --> 35:28.612
Sure, what's going on?

35:29.178 --> 35:31.493
Well, uh, maybe let's sit.

35:31.526 --> 35:33.240
Yeah, come on. Sit down.

35:33.407 --> 35:34.592
Okay.

35:37.895 --> 35:39.850
Okay. Um...

35:40.235 --> 35:42.983
This is hard for
me to bring up,

35:43.016 --> 35:47.771
but, um, because of the whole
thing that happened with Marty,

35:47.805 --> 35:49.281
I just wanted to tell
you about it now

35:49.318 --> 35:51.502
so that you don't think
this is a big deal.

35:51.537 --> 35:53.501
Or, actually, maybe it is a big deal.
I don't know.

35:53.536 --> 35:55.003
That's why I want to
talk to you about it.

35:55.035 --> 35:56.191
What's going on?

35:56.227 --> 36:01.612
Well, maybe it's just human nature.
Maybe we don't want to be happy.

36:01.648 --> 36:02.781
You're not happy?

36:02.817 --> 36:05.603
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm so happy.

36:05.635 --> 36:07.661
Okay, good,
so what's the problem?

36:07.765 --> 36:12.562
Um, I don't know. I never thought of
myself as a self-destructive person before,

36:12.596 --> 36:17.101
but I don't know, maybe I do have
this weird self-sabotaging streak.

36:17.136 --> 36:18.720
What are you talking about?

36:18.758 --> 36:22.941
Well, the grad student who's
filling in for my grandfather --

36:22.977 --> 36:25.713
I guess he's kind
of good-looking.

36:25.746 --> 36:29.360
And I ran into him at the bookstore,
and I told him I liked Isabel Allende,

36:29.397 --> 36:31.311
and it was disgusting!

36:31.348 --> 36:33.732
You told him you
like Isabel Allende?

36:33.768 --> 36:37.232
But it was the way I said it.
I was all nervous and weird.

36:37.265 --> 36:40.453
I googled him after class.
I don't know even know why.

36:40.488 --> 36:43.812
You're being so perfect,
and I'm turning into this monster.

36:43.847 --> 36:46.430
- You're not a monster.
- No, I am. I am.

36:46.467 --> 36:51.032
I think I got so safe
and felt so good with you

36:51.067 --> 36:53.561
that I let my guard down,
and this beast emerged.

36:53.597 --> 36:55.521
Hey, make up your mind.
Are you a beast or a monster?

36:55.557 --> 36:56.542
- Logan.
- What?

36:56.577 --> 36:58.543
It sounds like you have
a crush on this guy.

36:58.577 --> 37:00.242
I'm so sorry.

37:00.568 --> 37:02.242
Why are you looking
at me like that?

37:02.276 --> 37:03.773
It's just a crush.

37:03.837 --> 37:05.003
You're not upset?

37:05.038 --> 37:08.413
I'd be a hypocrite, because I have on
occasion found other girls attractive.

37:08.448 --> 37:09.400
Yes, I know.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.442
But I would never do anything
about it because I love you

37:11.477 --> 37:12.992
and want to be with you.

37:13.206 --> 37:14.483
That's good, I guess.

37:14.516 --> 37:16.661
- You guess.
- No, it is good.

37:16.696 --> 37:19.202
It's just, did I break you?

37:19.236 --> 37:20.370
What?

37:20.668 --> 37:23.973
Paris said that I broke you,
that if I kicked you with my spurs,

37:24.008 --> 37:25.440
you wouldn't spook.
Is that true?

37:25.477 --> 37:27.313
No, I'd definitely
be a little spooked.

37:27.347 --> 37:29.173
- You know what I mean.
- I honestly don't.

37:29.588 --> 37:33.671
I guess she meant that you
belong to me or something.

37:33.788 --> 37:35.570
Well, do you belong to me?

37:35.607 --> 37:37.260
Yeah, I guess I do.

37:37.295 --> 37:39.231
Well, then I'm cool with that.

37:39.266 --> 37:40.772
- You are?
- Yeah.

37:40.806 --> 37:42.660
This whole thing is my fault.

37:42.696 --> 37:44.821
- What? Why?
- I was a jerk about Marty.

37:44.857 --> 37:47.060
I overreacted,
and I obviously freaked you out so much

37:47.095 --> 37:49.192
I made you think you have to tell me
when you recommend a book to a guy,

37:49.228 --> 37:50.672
and you don't, okay?

37:50.708 --> 37:52.172
Yeah, okay.

37:52.208 --> 37:55.122
Because I trust you completely,
and I'm not worried about us.

37:55.155 --> 37:57.023
Yeah, I guess I'm not either.

37:57.377 --> 37:58.732
It's weird.

37:58.795 --> 38:00.201
But good weird?

38:00.477 --> 38:01.832
Great weird.

38:07.128 --> 38:09.491
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Anything.

38:09.686 --> 38:11.732
Has Paris ever
belly danced before?

38:11.765 --> 38:13.353
No, I think this is
her first class.

38:13.385 --> 38:15.301
- Another question?
- Shoot.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.542
Why the hell aren't we
over there watching her?

38:17.747 --> 38:19.080
Yeah, we should.

39:19.688 --> 39:21.520
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:23.985 --> 39:25.450
How was the funeral?

39:25.828 --> 39:26.910
Sad.

39:38.638 --> 39:41.092
- It's not just Luke.
- Lor...

39:43.678 --> 39:45.320
I mean, you were right.

39:45.946 --> 39:47.733
There are feelings there,

39:48.285 --> 39:49.580
because...

39:51.496 --> 39:54.333
When that ended, I just jumped.

39:55.295 --> 39:56.530
I pushed you.

39:57.876 --> 39:58.963
I jumped.

40:02.517 --> 40:04.731
But if that's all there was --

40:06.187 --> 40:07.913
If that's all it was,

40:08.496 --> 40:10.572
we could fix it, you know...

40:11.455 --> 40:12.893
with time.

40:13.895 --> 40:15.053
But it's not.

40:18.765 --> 40:23.131
You've always been this...
possibility for me...

40:25.866 --> 40:28.253
...this wonderful possibility.

40:29.545 --> 40:31.372
But it's just not right.

40:34.507 --> 40:36.292
And I'm so sorry.

40:37.897 --> 40:39.793
I'm so sorry.

40:44.498 --> 40:45.543
Yeah.

40:50.825 --> 40:52.641
I guess I should
have known, huh?

40:52.677 --> 40:55.412
It took me 20 years to
get you to say yes.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.780
I need you to know...

40:59.676 --> 41:02.301
that you're the man...

41:02.678 --> 41:04.691
I want to want.

41:06.356 --> 41:07.570
I know.

41:09.196 --> 41:13.840
You have no idea...
how badly I wish...

41:13.876 --> 41:14.912
I do.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.210
I do know.

41:31.045 --> 41:32.101
I do.
