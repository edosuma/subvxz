00:00.083 --> 00:02.292
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.334 --> 00:04.709
"For if true love's kiss
should ever break the curse,

00:04.751 --> 00:06.960
Henry Mills would surely die."

00:06.983 --> 00:08.048
Mom!

00:08.084 --> 00:10.217
Both the doctor and the baker were given

00:10.253 --> 00:11.652
a gift before they were attacked...

00:11.976 --> 00:13.358
A heart-shaped candy box

00:13.383 --> 00:14.855
filled with chocolate marzipan truffles.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.657
I want to find Anastasia.

00:16.692 --> 00:18.492
You can't change things
with the family you lost,

00:18.527 --> 00:20.203
so maybe, uh, you should try it

00:20.209 --> 00:21.626
with the family you still have.

00:22.667 --> 00:27.543
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

00:27.570 --> 00:30.170
Ready or not, here I come!

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.250 --> 00:43.917
Found you, Ana.

00:53.996 --> 00:55.896
Anastasia?!

00:58.773 --> 01:00.206
Anastasia?!

01:01.509 --> 01:03.709
Where are you?!

01:15.083 --> 01:18.667
I knew that lantern
would guide you to me.

01:18.688 --> 01:20.058
I got so lost.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.250
Don't worry, Drizella.

01:22.288 --> 01:25.705
I promise, your big sister
will never leave you.

01:26.025 --> 01:29.617
We might have found each
other, but now we're both lost.

01:29.653 --> 01:32.187
Luckily, I know a way
we can get back home.

01:32.665 --> 01:34.733
Take my hands.

01:34.751 --> 01:40.293
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

01:40.739 --> 01:43.074
As long as we're together,

01:43.099 --> 01:46.601
we'll always find a way back home.

01:58.792 --> 02:00.584
You said you'd never leave me.

02:03.334 --> 02:06.960
And for a while, I wished that was true.

02:07.023 --> 02:11.292
Every year you've laid in this box,

02:11.328 --> 02:13.895
I suffered under your shadow.

02:16.876 --> 02:21.335
I want Mother to feel
the pain that I endured.

02:21.371 --> 02:27.141
Only... I'm not strong
enough to cast this curse.

02:27.581 --> 02:32.213
Perhaps the answer lies within you.

02:38.209 --> 02:40.626
Well, isn't this familiar?

02:41.725 --> 02:44.625
Head full of steam. A
curse built on vengeance...

02:44.667 --> 02:48.168
And a nosy witch thinking
she can change my mind.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.666
You know, you once trusted
me to teach you about magic.

02:52.216 --> 02:54.636
Give up on this curse,

02:54.667 --> 02:56.168
and I'll find a way to help you.

02:56.381 --> 02:59.374
I... don't need your help.

02:59.709 --> 03:02.210
I don't need anyone.

03:08.709 --> 03:11.918
Gothel. What are you doing here?

03:11.955 --> 03:13.988
Testing your commitment.

03:14.024 --> 03:16.724
And I must say, child, I'm impressed.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.542
I don't care what you think.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.631
You should.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.876
The curse you seek requires more magic

03:23.918 --> 03:25.544
than you can conjure alone.

03:27.270 --> 03:29.537
There's great power in family,

03:29.584 --> 03:32.667
but nothing left to glean from yours.

03:37.834 --> 03:40.323
My circle of sisters

03:40.334 --> 03:42.918
has the most powerful
magic in this realm.

03:42.952 --> 03:47.555
Join us... or suffer
your failures alone.

03:47.590 --> 03:50.658
The choice is yours.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.262
I know what the problem is.

04:05.292 --> 04:06.876
I hired you to fix it!

04:07.125 --> 04:08.876
Now find my sister!

04:13.334 --> 04:16.188
And to think I used to
believe you were special.

04:16.209 --> 04:20.043
And here you are... lost again.

04:20.067 --> 04:23.591
I see you're encouraging as ever.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.042
I know we've had our differences,

04:27.097 --> 04:29.530
but I came to renew our deal.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.758
To find Anastasia?

04:31.884 --> 04:34.026
You just want the power
she has as the Guardian

04:34.051 --> 04:36.070
so you can get the Dark One's Dagger.

04:36.104 --> 04:39.349
What you want will kill her,
and I'll have no part of that.

04:40.195 --> 04:43.217
Your desire to honor your
mother's dying wish is noble.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.824
But you don't know where
she is any more than I do,

04:45.849 --> 04:48.216
and your plans to reunite
have run out of time.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.668
This was in the lobby when I arrived.

05:01.328 --> 05:03.854
I've already siphoned
some magic from Anastasia,

05:03.879 --> 05:06.279
and with you gone, I'll take the rest.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.883
I didn't survive this long

05:10.908 --> 05:14.008
to be killed by a chocolatier
with a penchant for theatrics.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.460
I'll be fine.

05:19.461 --> 05:22.529
What you'll be is exactly
like the other two victims...

05:22.798 --> 05:24.064
Dead.

05:25.340 --> 05:27.040
You wanted to stand alone, Ivy.

05:27.735 --> 05:30.277
Now you truly are.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.085
Hey, Roni.

05:37.090 --> 05:38.328
You got that to-go order?

05:38.353 --> 05:40.587
Uh, yes. Remy's firing it up now.

05:40.612 --> 05:42.179
No time to eat here?

05:42.288 --> 05:43.675
Oh, it's for Lucy and her sitter.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.209
I got plans with Sabine tonight.

05:47.634 --> 05:49.634
That's the sitter calling.

05:57.459 --> 05:59.043
What's the cocoa for?

05:59.045 --> 06:02.780
Well, keeping up this ruse
about Henry is hard on you.

06:02.816 --> 06:03.948
I can tell.

06:05.042 --> 06:07.084
But until I get my hands on some magic,

06:07.120 --> 06:09.720
there's no way to undo what Ivy's done.

06:10.144 --> 06:13.624
Hey, keeping your mom and dad apart

06:13.667 --> 06:15.792
keeps him alive.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.834
At least my mom has Sabine.

06:20.032 --> 06:22.432
Henry has nobody to cheer him up.

06:24.292 --> 06:27.793
You know, your dad might
be kind of a loner here,

06:27.824 --> 06:30.115
but before the curse,

06:30.125 --> 06:31.792
he had some pretty great friends.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.808
Like... fairy-tale friends?

06:35.071 --> 06:37.238
His two best friends were
Captain Hook and Jack.

06:38.458 --> 06:41.025
Here, they're known as Detective Rogers

06:41.050 --> 06:43.317
and... Nick.

06:44.688 --> 06:47.621
You mean my dad and my
cursed dad were friends?

06:47.646 --> 06:48.523
Yeah.

06:49.092 --> 06:51.427
How does that help us here?

06:51.452 --> 06:54.696
I bet if we get your dad and
his old friends together...

06:56.195 --> 06:57.607
fate'll do the rest.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.876
I'm on it.

06:59.876 --> 07:02.752
Operation Bromance is a go.

07:02.792 --> 07:03.751
Hmm.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.917
I wouldn't have taken you
for an antiques kind of guy.

07:14.348 --> 07:15.981
Hey, do you want to order some food

07:16.006 --> 07:17.352
and maybe work the candy-killer case?

07:17.866 --> 07:19.688
You're not really
calling it that, are you?

07:20.250 --> 07:21.667
Well, no, not me.

07:21.677 --> 07:23.345
Not me. The boys in the bullpen.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.637
No, I think we need a break.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.970
As my wife used to say,
wandering another path

07:27.995 --> 07:30.262
often leads us where we need to go.

07:30.407 --> 07:31.706
Hence the teacup.

07:31.731 --> 07:32.863
Well, in that case,

07:32.876 --> 07:35.293
I guess my path is
leading me to the market.

07:35.546 --> 07:38.814
Since Tilly moved in, I've
been going through a lot of jam.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.514
Enjoy your time off.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.334
Hey, Weaver.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.383
Got a call about a 13-year-old girl

07:48.417 --> 07:50.500
wandering outside an
abandoned restaurant.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.554
Fits the description of
the girl you're looking for.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.751
What's the deal with her anyway?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.159
She's just a scared girl,

07:58.195 --> 08:00.829
but also a piece of
a much larger puzzle.

08:11.918 --> 08:13.460
Hello?

08:15.626 --> 08:16.626
Why don't you come out?

08:16.667 --> 08:19.293
I've got a fresh can of pepper
spray we can try together.

08:29.658 --> 08:31.357
Ohh, who locked this door?

08:34.167 --> 08:35.793
Please don't hurt me!

08:37.349 --> 08:38.816
No!

08:41.972 --> 08:43.673
Ohh!

08:47.626 --> 08:49.043
Aah!

08:53.334 --> 08:54.584
Ohh!

09:12.042 --> 09:13.960
Aah!

09:15.414 --> 09:18.222
Yeah, I was always more
of a pinball man myself.

09:18.247 --> 09:20.347
I held the high score
for weeks on this game,

09:20.372 --> 09:23.664
and then... JBH went and claimed it.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.122
But I've got a stack of tokens

09:26.158 --> 09:28.840
and an evening committed
to undoing this injustice.

09:28.876 --> 09:31.405
Yeah. Noble quest for sure.

09:31.459 --> 09:34.210
But I've got to be honest, I
thought be out wooing Jacinda.

09:34.211 --> 09:35.978
Yeah, well,

09:36.003 --> 09:37.351
I've actually downgraded

09:37.376 --> 09:39.776
from wooing to giving her some space.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.500
But aside from seeing
me at geek DEFCON 1,

09:43.501 --> 09:44.377
what are you doing here?

09:44.401 --> 09:45.375
You tell me.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.402
Lucy texted me saying
you had a lead on my case.

09:48.361 --> 09:49.363
She did?

09:49.375 --> 09:50.959
Cool. "Galaga."

09:52.295 --> 09:55.142
Uh, you guys see Lucy around?

09:55.834 --> 09:58.531
Let me guess. She texted
you to meet her here?

09:58.542 --> 09:59.584
Yeah.

09:59.616 --> 10:00.518
How'd you know?

10:00.543 --> 10:02.425
Because the kid used to do
this with me and her mom.

10:02.494 --> 10:04.331
And now that she's
done playing matchmaker,

10:04.375 --> 10:05.802
it would appear that she's decided

10:05.834 --> 10:08.876
to literally text me
into the friend zone.

10:09.727 --> 10:10.633
Yeah, I'm sorry.

10:10.668 --> 10:11.980
I'm sure you guys
have better stuff to do

10:12.000 --> 10:14.083
than mash buttons and eat hot wings.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.017
Actually, I think this is
exactly where I need to be.

10:18.042 --> 10:19.108
Excuse me.

10:21.918 --> 10:23.293
All right.

10:23.314 --> 10:25.081
Let's see what you got.

10:31.523 --> 10:34.757
Uh, yeah, we got a strict
no-whiskey-for-witches policy.

10:36.459 --> 10:38.001
It's about the killer.

10:38.022 --> 10:39.621
He came for me.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.329
If not for the heel on my stiletto,

10:46.334 --> 10:47.835
I would be dead right now.

10:48.117 --> 10:49.455
Okay.

10:49.491 --> 10:50.890
You want my help?

10:52.160 --> 10:55.328
Bring me a fix for whatever
you poisoned Henry with.

10:55.926 --> 10:56.968
I don't have one.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.375
If I did, I swear, I
would give it to you.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.326
But... Please.

11:01.834 --> 11:03.251
I'm powerless here.

11:03.292 --> 11:04.168
I need magic.

11:04.209 --> 11:06.960
Have you found any way at all
to glean some from this world?

11:06.961 --> 11:09.793
You set this curse up so I had none.

11:09.806 --> 11:11.836
I'm so stupid.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.204
I built a trap around myself.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.473
And the irony is I was going
to go find my sister, Anastasia,

11:15.509 --> 11:16.441
and make amends.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.977
And then fate held a knife to my throat,

11:19.012 --> 11:22.514
literally held a knife to my throat.

11:26.375 --> 11:29.834
Yeah, I wouldn't save me, either.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.491
All right.

11:33.817 --> 11:35.556
You did the right thing coming to me.

11:35.581 --> 11:37.181
I'll call Weaver.

11:38.057 --> 11:39.022
Thank you.

11:39.751 --> 11:42.585
And you're safe here.

11:42.603 --> 11:44.270
Trust me.

11:44.305 --> 11:47.540
If anyone's gonna have the
pleasure of killing you,

11:47.801 --> 11:49.501
it's gonna be me.

12:00.167 --> 12:02.918
I see you've come to your senses.

12:02.964 --> 12:05.731
I've come to join your little
supernatural sewing circle.

12:07.292 --> 12:09.204
It's not that simple.

12:09.358 --> 12:11.959
You're not the only witch with interest.

12:14.375 --> 12:18.291
Now the last recruit has arrived...

12:18.292 --> 12:19.876
we can begin.

12:22.918 --> 12:24.627
Each of you shows promise.

12:24.669 --> 12:27.770
But only two of you will get the honor

12:27.806 --> 12:29.887
of joining The Coven of the Eight.

12:30.774 --> 12:33.686
I've hidden two golden flowers

12:33.709 --> 12:36.585
in the woods beyond the river.

12:36.613 --> 12:39.915
Whoever returns with
these mystical plants

12:39.950 --> 12:42.451
will show themselves worthy.

12:42.618 --> 12:44.319
You'll each work alone.

12:44.624 --> 12:47.522
You'll have to be savvy and cutthroat.

12:47.626 --> 12:49.418
Well, so much for sisterhood.

12:53.042 --> 12:56.709
Sisterhood is a prize not easily won.

13:01.305 --> 13:03.238
Happy hunting.

13:10.167 --> 13:12.209
Gothel can be a bag of wind sometimes.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.002
I liked seeing you put her in her place.

13:14.035 --> 13:15.434
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the show.

13:15.459 --> 13:16.459
Hang on one second.

13:20.703 --> 13:22.287
I knew you were the strong one.

13:22.785 --> 13:24.110
What's your point?

13:24.145 --> 13:26.245
Alone out here, we're
just gonna get lost.

13:26.281 --> 13:28.781
But together, we can find these things.

13:28.816 --> 13:31.517
We can both win this.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.750
I'm glad I didn't run you
through with that stick.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.418
While I would love a drink,
I'm not in the mood for company.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.175
Your troubled mood is
exactly why I'm here...

14:05.501 --> 14:06.876
Drizella.

14:09.918 --> 14:12.168
And who exactly are you?

14:12.217 --> 14:13.216
Hmm.

14:13.224 --> 14:15.633
Dr. Facilier, at your service.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.073
Oh, I can service myself, thanks.

14:19.393 --> 14:21.257
I'd say your encounter at the garage

14:21.292 --> 14:23.251
has proven that to be most untrue.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.208
The killer's going to keep coming.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.671
And who's to say you aren't the killer?

14:36.334 --> 14:39.090
I'm a witch doctor.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.292
I'm just as much a target as you.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.286
I've come to make a deal.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.418
Roni already has my back.

14:48.112 --> 14:50.379
See, Roni only cares

14:50.417 --> 14:53.001
about fixing the son you poisoned.

14:53.042 --> 14:57.084
And you've already told
her you can't do that.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.208
Your mother's gone.

14:59.223 --> 15:01.023
Your sister hates you.

15:01.058 --> 15:03.592
The coven's turned their back on you.

15:03.626 --> 15:05.544
No one's going to help you.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.176
Except me.

15:08.484 --> 15:10.833
Only by escaping to another realm

15:10.868 --> 15:12.468
will you ever be safe.

15:12.501 --> 15:13.293
Let me guess.

15:13.314 --> 15:15.136
That magic bean comes with a cost?

15:16.776 --> 15:19.975
You'll pay for your life
with the price of another.

15:20.011 --> 15:21.223
Your sister.

15:23.103 --> 15:25.214
Gothel will get to her anyway.

15:25.542 --> 15:27.075
It's in the cards.

15:28.322 --> 15:29.821
So, either you can let your sister die

15:29.834 --> 15:31.793
empowering that witch,

15:31.848 --> 15:35.149
or you can let her death
pay for your safety.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.038
Even if I wanted to,

15:44.039 --> 15:45.757
I've been looking for her for days.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.459
That girl is nowhere to be found.

15:47.486 --> 15:50.187
You don't need to find her
when you can make her find you.

16:32.597 --> 16:35.928
Wow. So that little
girl's magic did all this.

16:36.501 --> 16:39.103
You know, you'd think
ignoring someone's phone calls

16:39.125 --> 16:42.250
would be a big enough hint
that you didn't want to chat.

16:43.162 --> 16:45.162
I wasn't inviting you over for tea.

16:45.529 --> 16:48.096
Ivy was attacked by the killer.

16:48.577 --> 16:50.445
And while I was filling your voicemail,

16:50.470 --> 16:52.701
my bar-back saw her leave with someone.

16:53.478 --> 16:56.264
Uh, with Gothel?

16:56.306 --> 16:58.640
Or do you mean your, uh,
clandestine boyfriend?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.667
Don't tell me you've forgotten

17:02.709 --> 17:04.335
it's my business to collect secrets.

17:05.093 --> 17:07.415
And the question really is

17:07.451 --> 17:10.647
when were you gonna tell me
about this desire for my dagger?

17:10.673 --> 17:13.255
I was hoping I could change his mind,

17:13.834 --> 17:15.209
like Belle did for you.

17:15.228 --> 17:16.724
Well, he clearly
hasn't changed his mind.

17:16.751 --> 17:20.126
And if Facilier succeeds, I
might never get back to Belle.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.963
If he gets his hands on Anastasia...

17:21.999 --> 17:24.132
I know what terrible things
he can do with that magic.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.901
It's why I've come to you.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.537
Yeah.

17:32.042 --> 17:33.975
So, what do we do now?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.510
Quite simply?

17:35.546 --> 17:39.581
We have to get to
Anastasia before Ivy does.

18:08.959 --> 18:10.959
Can we have a little less lollipops

18:11.000 --> 18:12.918
and a little more finding flowers?

18:12.934 --> 18:14.901
I have a brother like you.

18:14.936 --> 18:17.870
Always a bit of a sour ball.

18:17.906 --> 18:21.340
For a long time, it seemed
like we raised each other.

18:21.667 --> 18:22.876
Well, if you guys are so tight,

18:22.918 --> 18:25.185
why isn't he sharing lollipops with you?

18:26.324 --> 18:27.603
Where you start with your siblings

18:27.628 --> 18:29.081
isn't always where you end up.

18:29.584 --> 18:31.001
And where did you end up?

18:31.292 --> 18:32.334
At a gingerbread house.

18:32.934 --> 18:34.645
We got caught by a witch.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.540
She tried to throw us in her oven.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.582
Seems like you got out okay.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.783
Not unscathed.

18:40.717 --> 18:42.847
And from that day on, I was determined

18:42.876 --> 18:45.210
never to be weak to
that sort of power again.

18:46.310 --> 18:47.802
And your brother?

18:48.017 --> 18:50.178
Forever altered.

18:50.213 --> 18:55.082
His arms, scarred from
burns. And his mind, well...

18:57.786 --> 19:00.887
Last I heard, he was traveling
around under a different name.

19:03.125 --> 19:06.334
You might not get it,
but losing a sibling

19:06.375 --> 19:09.334
eats a hole in you that's
damn-near impossible to fill.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.001
I get it more than you know.

19:16.042 --> 19:17.459
What was his name?

19:18.125 --> 19:19.876
Hansel.

19:19.905 --> 19:21.004
I'm Gretel.

19:21.381 --> 19:23.440
Good to meet you, Gretel.

19:23.476 --> 19:25.175
I'm Drizella.

19:40.922 --> 19:42.759
Ah.

19:42.795 --> 19:44.361
Candy gumdrops.

19:44.626 --> 19:46.043
Well, I guess you did learn something

19:46.125 --> 19:47.751
in that gingerbread house after all.

19:48.111 --> 19:50.446
And if your abilities weren't
as sharp as your tongue,

19:50.482 --> 19:53.049
we'd be flat as sugar cookies right now.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.085
Come on. Let's best these witches.

19:59.169 --> 20:01.290
Ah! God.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.719
Now, you've got two good hands,

20:02.751 --> 20:03.918
and I still did better than that.

20:05.709 --> 20:08.043
Ohh, hey, thanks for sticking around.

20:08.060 --> 20:08.940
I needed this.

20:08.975 --> 20:09.974
Yeah, me, too.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.210
Well, the real question is

20:12.250 --> 20:14.388
have you accomplished
what you set out to do?

20:14.417 --> 20:16.857
Well, if we're talking
high scores, then no,

20:16.876 --> 20:18.293
but if we're talking about forgetting

20:18.350 --> 20:19.649
an adorably frustrating,

20:19.685 --> 20:21.818
yet underdog, endearing single mom

20:21.853 --> 20:24.554
then still no.

20:25.924 --> 20:28.787
I just... I just can't
tell if Jacinda and I

20:28.792 --> 20:30.959
are meant for each other anymore.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.863
Someone smart once told me

20:34.459 --> 20:36.085
sometimes wandering a different path

20:36.125 --> 20:37.500
takes you to where you need to go.

20:38.352 --> 20:40.012
What does that mean?

20:40.048 --> 20:42.348
It means there are plenty
of women in this bar

20:42.383 --> 20:46.686
who would find your whole
John Hughes outlook charming.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.879
It's time to see what
fate has in store for you.

20:49.152 --> 20:51.257
And how do you gentlemen
propose I do that?

20:51.292 --> 20:52.959
Simple.

20:53.372 --> 20:54.771
You're gonna walk up and ask out

20:54.796 --> 20:56.362
the next woman who comes in the bar.

20:57.545 --> 20:59.604
- Yep. 
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

20:59.629 --> 21:01.300
I...

21:02.584 --> 21:04.085
All right. You know what?

21:04.130 --> 21:06.447
You guys might see me crash
and burn, but I'll do it.

21:06.654 --> 21:08.633
Next woman who walks through that door

21:08.667 --> 21:11.126
is getting asked out by Henry Mills.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.192
Getting through that trap
gives us a pretty big lead.

21:41.209 --> 21:43.334
The question is,

21:43.524 --> 21:45.391
which way do we go to keep it?

21:48.083 --> 21:49.959
Both.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.084
We're a team, right?

21:56.094 --> 21:57.685
If I was gonna screw you over,

21:57.720 --> 22:00.254
I would have let the trap
do my dirty work for me.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.084
You're right.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.222
We meet back here?

22:05.258 --> 22:07.858
With flowers in hand,
and we win this thing.

22:08.140 --> 22:09.660
Together.

22:18.876 --> 22:20.377
What are you doing here?

22:20.417 --> 22:21.751
I've come to help you win.

22:22.220 --> 22:23.422
These other witches,

22:23.447 --> 22:25.584
they're just further traps for you,

22:25.819 --> 22:28.754
obstacles to test your resolve.

22:30.024 --> 22:34.119
You alone have proven yourself
worthy to join the coven.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.792
But you said there were two spots.

22:35.845 --> 22:37.712
I lied. And about the flowers, too.

22:37.747 --> 22:39.714
There's none in these woods.

22:41.667 --> 22:45.126
Your real test has yet to begin.

22:50.709 --> 22:52.709
Prove you're one of us.

22:54.167 --> 22:55.209
Kill Gretel.

22:55.855 --> 22:57.542
I don't want to do that.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.868
But you do want your curse.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.375
And the only way
you're going to get that

23:01.384 --> 23:04.185
is with my family by your side.

23:08.250 --> 23:12.001
I warned you witches
not to get too close.

23:27.918 --> 23:29.836
Drizella?

23:33.099 --> 23:35.931
It's me, Ana. I'm so glad you came.

23:35.959 --> 23:38.460
- I-I lit a lantern like we used to. 
- What do you want?

23:42.292 --> 23:45.918
I needed to see you, to talk to you.

23:47.834 --> 23:51.209
I've done terrible things.

23:51.258 --> 23:53.992
I think I did them because I was afraid.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.518
I got so lost, Ana.

23:58.553 --> 24:01.254
Again.

24:01.290 --> 24:03.323
I was hoping you would help me get home.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.258
But Gothel said that there was no way.

24:05.294 --> 24:06.693
I found one.

24:06.937 --> 24:07.936
A-A magic bean.

24:07.961 --> 24:09.763
It opens a door to our realm.

24:09.798 --> 24:12.265
It just needs your magic to enchant it.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.125
I'm sorry that I didn't
realize this before,

24:20.134 --> 24:24.870
but... I need you.

24:31.751 --> 24:35.085
All I ever wanted was for
us to be home together.

24:35.132 --> 24:37.799
Me, too, Ana. Me, too.

24:38.264 --> 24:39.665
So, let's go.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.042
Where's the magic bean?

24:42.078 --> 24:44.245
Right here.

24:52.412 --> 24:54.312
You... lied.

24:54.337 --> 24:55.343
I'm so sorry, Ana.

24:55.378 --> 24:57.178
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ana.

24:57.209 --> 24:59.960
Know that... Mother
wanted us to be together,

24:59.983 --> 25:02.817
and I-I tried to do the
right thing this time.

25:05.508 --> 25:07.207
But I don't want to die.

25:09.834 --> 25:13.959
And if it comes down to you or me...

25:14.309 --> 25:16.130
I choose me.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.500
Doesn't all this seem weird?

25:19.535 --> 25:21.035
I mean, come on, you
can't deny how the universe

25:21.060 --> 25:22.359
keeps bringing us together.

25:22.384 --> 25:24.802
Because my dinner with Sabine
ended up right next door to you?

25:24.834 --> 25:26.168
Yes! Exactly!

25:26.175 --> 25:27.574
Well, you sound like Lucy.

25:27.816 --> 25:29.549
What if Lucy could be right?

25:29.845 --> 25:31.478
About fairy tales?

25:31.513 --> 25:33.980
Okay, just for a moment,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.125
just pretend that you
really are Cinderella.

25:36.185 --> 25:37.918
I mean, come on, how
great would that be?

25:37.953 --> 25:39.019
I don't know.

25:39.054 --> 25:40.921
Glass slippers seem
like a terrible idea.

25:40.959 --> 25:43.501
Ah, but me being a handsome prince

25:43.525 --> 25:46.026
here to sweep you off your
feet seems pretty good.

25:46.061 --> 25:52.287
Well, then, what we need right
now is a way to test fate.

25:52.292 --> 25:54.251
- Okay.
- Wait here.

25:57.334 --> 25:58.543
Wow. We, uh...

25:58.581 --> 26:00.548
We really should have put
some money down on this.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.984
My mind's still on the case, obviously.

26:03.298 --> 26:06.070
Yeah. Candy killer thing?

26:07.626 --> 26:10.000
Hey, I understand if
you can't talk about it.

26:10.001 --> 26:10.888
No, it's not that.

26:10.913 --> 26:12.922
It's just we don't have any real leads.

26:13.274 --> 26:15.080
Well, now you're making me nervous.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.349
Well, you don't need to be.

26:17.384 --> 26:19.251
The victims all got a warning,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.386
unless you received
anonymous chocolates.

26:21.921 --> 26:23.255
I didn't.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.324
I'm not really much of a sweets guy.

26:25.628 --> 26:28.827
Although I will name my next
band Anonymous Chocolates.

26:31.542 --> 26:33.542
That's an impossible
shot. Nobody can make that.

26:33.583 --> 26:34.982
Well, that's the whole point.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.553
Me walking through those
doors could be a coincidence,

26:38.584 --> 26:45.709
but you sinking in this token
is truly a million to one.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.428
Mm-hmm.

26:47.459 --> 26:49.960
All right, so, if it lands in the mug,

26:50.292 --> 26:54.709
then everything's real...
the fairy tales, destiny...

26:55.170 --> 26:56.303
true love.

26:58.428 --> 27:00.633
Good luck, my prince.

27:02.418 --> 27:03.377
All right.

27:04.647 --> 27:06.246
Okay.

27:10.221 --> 27:11.846
Phew.

27:24.501 --> 27:26.750
Did it... Did he just...?

27:26.751 --> 27:28.168
Did you... Did you just see...?

27:28.210 --> 27:30.010
Settled that once and for all.

27:30.792 --> 27:32.541
Uh, you heading out?

27:32.542 --> 27:35.334
Uh, yeah, Sabine just
texted. Our table's ready.

27:39.709 --> 27:41.918
Till we meet again.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.250
Henry Mills.

27:56.104 --> 27:58.238
Will she suffer?

28:03.792 --> 28:05.543
Does it really matter to you?

28:11.042 --> 28:13.209
The ash will absorb her magic.

28:13.552 --> 28:15.419
And when it's all over,

28:15.444 --> 28:18.578
that bean will be imbued
with enough to take you home.

28:27.068 --> 28:28.902
Just one last thing to do.

28:39.751 --> 28:41.460
Is this part of your ritual, too?

28:41.596 --> 28:44.597
No, this isn't my doing.

28:48.834 --> 28:50.634
She's waking up.

28:50.667 --> 28:52.001
How is this possible?

28:52.833 --> 28:54.899
Because I'm waking her up.

28:56.626 --> 28:59.960
And I'd be worried about what
she's going to do to you, Ivy,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.626
because you've been a very bad sister.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.959
You beat me back here.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.793
Does that mean you found something?

29:17.315 --> 29:19.505
No, I was just thinking.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.917
About what?

29:29.375 --> 29:31.959
Gothel can't be trusted.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.471
What happened to you and your
family in the gingerbread house,

29:34.506 --> 29:37.874
it happened to my
family, too, with Gothel.

29:39.334 --> 29:42.334
I don't want to be in her coven anymore.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.881
I know we haven't known each
other for that long, but...

29:44.918 --> 29:46.752
- We have a connection.
- Yes.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.446
You and I are all the
sisterhood we need.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.317
Whatever it is you
came here today to do,

29:53.757 --> 29:56.226
we can help each other do it.

29:57.743 --> 29:59.048
I'm in.

30:01.334 --> 30:03.252
And I know how we're
gonna get what we want.

30:04.548 --> 30:08.049
You may not have found a
golden flower, but I did.

30:12.042 --> 30:13.376
Come see for yourself.

30:14.815 --> 30:17.149
I think I'll stay right here.

30:19.255 --> 30:20.655
Oh.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.013
She came to you, too.

30:25.417 --> 30:26.792
I wanted you to leave here with me.

30:26.809 --> 30:28.532
That's not a candy cane in your hand.

30:28.542 --> 30:30.293
Lower your weapon.

30:33.042 --> 30:34.293
That's what I thought.

30:47.162 --> 30:49.663
Ohh!

30:53.209 --> 30:54.543
I don't want to hurt you.

30:54.614 --> 30:56.548
And I want a spot in that family.

30:56.583 --> 30:57.816
I need it.

30:58.986 --> 31:00.444
I'm sorry.

31:17.892 --> 31:19.926
Congratulations.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.495
You did it.

31:22.530 --> 31:24.263
I didn't want to.

31:24.527 --> 31:26.566
But you did.

31:26.709 --> 31:30.251
Now let's talk about
your vengeance, sister.

31:44.584 --> 31:47.001
Ana, please talk to me.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.001
There's nothing left to say.

31:49.042 --> 31:50.292
Aah!

31:51.810 --> 31:53.276
You know what you need to do.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.705
Me? You said you'd help me.

31:55.751 --> 31:58.001
These aren't my cards being turned over.

32:05.751 --> 32:09.377
And another pillar you've
clung to has crumbled.

32:15.876 --> 32:18.293
It's time, Anastasia.

32:18.730 --> 32:23.598
Time to show your sister how
alone she really left you.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.794
Don't listen to her, Ana!

32:30.959 --> 32:33.001
You don't care about me.

32:33.030 --> 32:34.263
You never have!

32:34.288 --> 32:35.820
That's not true!

32:35.834 --> 32:37.752
I loved you more than anyone.

32:38.264 --> 32:40.448
Gothel convinced me that
you could be replaced,

32:40.483 --> 32:41.755
but she was wrong.

32:41.780 --> 32:42.746
She tricked me.

32:42.771 --> 32:44.729
And she tricked you.

32:45.537 --> 32:48.052
I never drew you in with that lantern.

32:49.572 --> 32:50.638
She's right.

32:51.828 --> 32:53.145
I've done some horrible things

32:53.167 --> 32:55.793
because she pushed me to do them,

32:56.303 --> 32:59.356
all to force us to this very moment.

32:59.776 --> 33:02.463
Why should I believe
anything you have to say?

33:02.834 --> 33:05.752
Because you were always
the one bright light

33:05.792 --> 33:07.293
that guided me home.

33:07.662 --> 33:09.811
And Gothel realized to get your power,

33:09.846 --> 33:12.247
she had to break the bond between us.

33:13.349 --> 33:14.962
If you kill me,

33:14.987 --> 33:16.751
you'll sully your pure heart...

33:16.820 --> 33:19.821
And if I kill you, she
gets the magic, too.

33:20.667 --> 33:25.179
I don't want to see you
lose your Guardianship,

33:25.209 --> 33:26.626
so do as you wish.

33:27.272 --> 33:30.540
I won't let Gothel
control my fate anymore.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.168
What are you doing?! Do it.

33:42.667 --> 33:43.959
Kill her now!

33:44.304 --> 33:45.679
Come on!

33:49.501 --> 33:50.543
Kill her!

33:52.044 --> 33:53.009
No.

34:00.292 --> 34:02.126
Ana.

34:08.958 --> 34:12.333
I guess you underestimated
the power of sisterhood.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.667
What the hell happened here?

34:26.626 --> 34:29.001
Your good-hearted boyfriend.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.292
You okay?

34:36.042 --> 34:37.751
Couldn't have just stayed at that table?

34:37.768 --> 34:41.069
I know. I know. You were right.

34:42.918 --> 34:45.460
Well, I would have left, too.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.335
I never should have left you at
the tower all those years ago.

34:51.375 --> 34:55.600
Yeah, well, I know a little something

34:55.626 --> 34:57.502
about being a difficult student.

34:57.562 --> 35:01.698
All those lessons about family and love,

35:01.751 --> 35:03.751
I thought they would weaken my magic.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.735
But I get it now.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.171
That's where the
strongest magic comes from.

35:08.209 --> 35:10.918
Uh, it s... it sounds
like you're saying goodbye.

35:11.479 --> 35:13.810
I know I'm leaving behind a big mess,

35:13.845 --> 35:15.523
and I cast the curse.

35:15.548 --> 35:18.330
And you're probably angry with me.

35:18.355 --> 35:19.949
Angry?

35:20.417 --> 35:22.251
You tried to kill my son.

35:22.674 --> 35:25.146
Angry is quite the understatement.

35:25.709 --> 35:29.124
But I also know that
you didn't do this alone.

35:29.125 --> 35:30.834
Gothel manipulated you.

35:30.882 --> 35:32.681
And if Gothel's after your sister,

35:32.706 --> 35:34.239
the sooner she's safe and out of reach,

35:34.264 --> 35:36.865
the better it is for all of us.

35:36.918 --> 35:37.836
So...

35:40.375 --> 35:41.584
Go.

35:42.757 --> 35:44.858
We're gonna be okay.

35:44.893 --> 35:45.758
Trust me.

35:45.794 --> 35:48.094
We've broken curses before.

35:48.129 --> 35:50.563
We won't stop fighting
until we break this one.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.467
So, do you forgive me?

35:57.211 --> 36:01.213
Mm, let's just say I understand you.

36:02.709 --> 36:08.084
My gift to you... is
what I always wanted...

36:08.107 --> 36:11.475
Someone to believe I can change.

36:12.810 --> 36:14.658
Thank you.

36:15.959 --> 36:18.877
I don't even know what I'm
going to say to Jacinda.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.937
Well, don't worry.

36:23.138 --> 36:25.205
When the time's right,
we'll tell her everything.

36:26.792 --> 36:30.126
Drizzy, were you honest before?

36:30.180 --> 36:31.913
Can that bean really bring us back?

36:31.949 --> 36:34.700
I was told yes, but I
don't know how to do it.

36:34.725 --> 36:37.152
I do. Take my hands.

37:02.626 --> 37:04.166
You were right, Ana.

37:04.167 --> 37:07.043
When we're together, we'll
always find a way home.

37:19.325 --> 37:21.520
I'm surprised you let the Guardian go.

37:23.334 --> 37:25.293
Well, it was the right thing to do.

37:25.298 --> 37:27.920
So, you're giving up
on getting to Belle?

37:28.572 --> 37:31.640
It might seem that way,

37:31.667 --> 37:34.459
but you know, every time I do good...

37:35.070 --> 37:37.570
it just brings me closer to her.

37:39.209 --> 37:40.668
Now I've got to believe that one day,

37:40.669 --> 37:42.251
another Guardian will appear.

37:43.196 --> 37:46.520
But those two sisters
going off together...

37:46.823 --> 37:51.625
Well, that means today is
a good day for everyone.

38:06.751 --> 38:08.751
What are you doing here?

38:08.778 --> 38:10.078
Hmm?

38:10.113 --> 38:11.755
Gonna prey on some more of my customers?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.959
You think that's what happened tonight?

38:16.250 --> 38:19.792
I did what I needed
to get what I wanted,

38:19.876 --> 38:22.293
just as I told you I would.

38:22.538 --> 38:24.008
And you're still no closer

38:24.033 --> 38:26.123
to your precious Dark One dagger.

38:26.167 --> 38:28.459
Well, it wasn't the
dagger I was after tonight.

38:29.417 --> 38:32.542
Just a little bit of this.

38:34.503 --> 38:39.156
So, you stole magic and ran away?

38:41.501 --> 38:43.960
I left those girls so
they could find each other,

38:43.963 --> 38:46.447
just as the cards told me they would.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.815
You expect me to believe that?

38:50.076 --> 38:52.514
Weaver's got you thinking
something awful about me.

38:52.542 --> 38:54.001
Yeah, well, he's usually right.

38:54.042 --> 38:55.584
Not about this.

38:55.642 --> 38:58.076
Look.

39:01.281 --> 39:04.850
Anastasia was never going to die.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.488
I just needed to siphon some magic

39:06.501 --> 39:08.168
when she used her power.

39:08.209 --> 39:10.853
And now that you have it,
how do you plan on using it?

39:12.432 --> 39:13.677
As a gift.

39:14.213 --> 39:16.094
As I always intended.

39:19.792 --> 39:22.334
Go find a way to save your son.

39:29.709 --> 39:32.251
Can I really trust this
doesn't come with a price?

39:32.792 --> 39:38.459
The only price to pay
is seeing that smile.

39:47.501 --> 39:49.751
Thank you, guys, by the
way. We got to hang again.

39:49.792 --> 39:51.161
Oh, you're just saying that

39:51.167 --> 39:53.709
because you reclaimed
your "Galaga" score.

39:54.165 --> 39:56.432
Oh. Is that your car?

39:59.459 --> 40:02.207
Well, it looks like my paperweight now.

40:02.208 --> 40:03.307
You need some help?

40:03.342 --> 40:05.492
No. You guys head home.

40:05.542 --> 40:06.667
I can take care of it.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.681
You're a good man, Henry.

40:10.717 --> 40:14.193
It's time you responded
to those signs, you know?

40:14.218 --> 40:16.854
Well, technically, I
didn't sink the shot.

40:16.889 --> 40:19.190
Then forget the signs, bro.

40:20.890 --> 40:22.960
Rogers. Good luck on that case.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.751
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

40:24.764 --> 40:28.841
I'm betting the answer
is right under your nose.

41:05.417 --> 41:09.626
Are you lying in wait or just watching?

41:09.673 --> 41:13.241
It's my understanding that
it's you who's been out for me.

41:14.367 --> 41:17.112
You're looking quite tired, Dark One.

41:17.167 --> 41:18.584
You feeling the weight of time?

41:18.626 --> 41:21.377
If you think you're getting my dagger,

41:21.417 --> 41:23.354
you are gonna suffer the same fate

41:23.375 --> 41:25.293
as all others who have tried.

41:25.349 --> 41:27.989
Really?

41:28.602 --> 41:33.296
Because I know of your desire
to join Belle in the afterlife.

41:33.334 --> 41:38.043
And killing anyone might just
keep you away from her forever.

41:39.375 --> 41:41.750
You interfere with my family,

41:42.114 --> 41:46.032
rest assured, I will find a loophole,

41:46.341 --> 41:51.143
and I will put both your
feet on the other side.
