57:41.334 --> 57:43.754
He says he wasn't alone.

57:46.840 --> 57:47.840
He drew this?

57:49.342 --> 57:52.182
He says it's his friend from the forest.

57:52.512 --> 57:53.932
And it reminded me of...

57:54.013 --> 57:55.853
I know what it reminded you of.

57:57.183 --> 57:58.233
That one?

57:58.852 --> 57:59.942
GRACE: Oh.

58:00.019 --> 58:02.519
How old was I when
you drew this for me?

58:02.689 --> 58:03.979
Uh, maybe five or six.

58:04.065 --> 58:05.525
Just before your mother passed away.

58:06.568 --> 58:09.778
I remember then,
you hung on every word I ever said.

58:11.030 --> 58:13.030
You were so full of questions.

Please, don't tell me another story.

Just tell me what you remember.

58:25.086 --> 58:26.416
(SIGHS)

58:28.590 --> 58:29.720
What I remember?

58:31.801 --> 58:34.721
What I remember is, I was out hunting...

58:36.055 --> 58:37.595
and the sun was shining down...

58:38.224 --> 58:39.702
and wind was blowing through the trees.

58:39.726 --> 58:42.436
And I remember thinking,
"Boy, this is exactly where I belong."

58:43.605 --> 58:45.605
I stopped by a creek to get a drink.

58:45.773 --> 58:47.693
Suddenly I realize
I wasn't in the sun anymore...

58:47.775 --> 58:49.935
and I looked up to see
what was blocking the sky.

58:50.111 --> 58:53.911
And what did I see but a dragon?

58:54.991 --> 58:56.581
I see a dragon.

58:58.494 --> 59:00.084
I've never been so scared in my life.

59:01.581 --> 59:04.291
But when I raised my gun to shoot...

59:04.459 --> 59:08.089
suddenly there was this feeling, this...

59:09.172 --> 59:10.672
It was like magic.

59:11.591 --> 59:14.261
There's no other word to express it.
It was magic.

59:15.970 --> 59:18.810
So, I put my gun down
and just sat there...

59:18.973 --> 59:23.653
and we sat there across the creek
from each other just looking.

59:24.312 --> 59:26.112
I just sat there looking.

59:26.272 --> 59:29.152
And then the dragon turned
and disappeared into the woods.

59:29.317 --> 59:31.687
And I remember thinking,
"I am one lucky guy."

59:35.323 --> 59:36.823
Of course, nobody believed me.

59:37.533 --> 59:39.203
I knew what people
were saying about me.

59:39.369 --> 59:42.089
I must admit, there were times
when I thought, "Maybe they're right."

59:42.163 --> 59:44.833
But then I thought about the magic.

59:45.667 --> 59:47.707
It changed the way I see the world...

59:47.877 --> 59:49.837
the way I see trees,
the way I see sunshine...

59:50.004 --> 59:51.554
the way, even, I see you.

59:54.008 --> 59:56.048
I wouldn't trade that for anything.

59:59.806 --> 01:00:02.556
So, I'm not gonna try to
convince you. I quit that.

01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:08.402
But maybe if you
could just be open to looking.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:12.987
I know those woods.

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.821
I know those woods
like the back of my hand.

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:22.156
I couldn't have missed a dragon.

<i>The way you see the world
It got you this far</i>

01:35:37.274 --> 01:35:41.704
<i>You might have some bruises
and a few scars</i>

01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:45.120
<i>But you know you're gonna be okay</i>

01:35:47.410 --> 01:35:49.620
<i>And even though you're scared</i>

01:35:49.703 --> 01:35:52.003
<i>You're stronger than you know</i>

01:35:52.873 --> 01:35:55.423
<i>If you're lost out
where the lights are blinding</i>

01:35:55.501 --> 01:35:57.381
<i>Caught and all the stars are hiding</i>

01:35:57.461 --> 01:36:00.841
<i>That's when something wild
calls you home</i>

01:36:00.923 --> 01:36:01.923
<i>Home</i>

01:36:01.966 --> 01:36:04.426
<i>If you face the fear
that keeps you frozen</i>

01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:06.600
<i>Chase the sky into the ocean</i>

01:36:06.679 --> 01:36:09.849
<i>That's when something wild
calls you home</i>

01:36:09.932 --> 01:36:10.932
<i>Home</i>

01:36:11.308 --> 01:36:13.688
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:15.561
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

01:36:15.855 --> 01:36:18.895
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa</i>

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:30.159
<i>Calls you home</i>

01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:35.500
<i>Calls you home</i>

01:36:37.334 --> 01:36:39.554
<i>Calls you home</i>

01:36:41.672 --> 01:36:44.052
<i>Calls you home</i>

01:36:47.261 --> 01:36:49.721
<i>You're lost out where
the lights are blinding</i>

01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:51.885
<i>Caught and all the stars are hiding</i>

01:36:51.974 --> 01:36:54.854
<i>That's when something wild
calls you home</i>

01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.770
<i>If you're lost out where
the lights are blinding</i>

01:36:58.856 --> 01:37:01.106
<i>Caught and all the stars are hiding</i>

01:37:01.192 --> 01:37:04.112
<i>That's when something wild
calls you home</i>

01:37:04.195 --> 01:37:05.195
<i>Home</i>

01:37:05.279 --> 01:37:07.869

<i>Go North, go North</i>

01:37:41.524 --> 01:37:44.654
<i>With wings on your feet</i>

01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:47.782
<i>Go North with the wind</i>

01:37:47.863 --> 01:37:51.533
<i>Where the three rivers meet</i>

01:37:51.617 --> 01:37:54.367
<i>There's a clearing of sorts</i>

01:37:54.453 --> 01:37:58.253
<i>In the circle of trees</i>

01:37:58.624 --> 01:38:03.844
<i>Where the wild constellations shine
One two and three</i>

01:38:05.756 --> 01:38:10.256
<i>Look all around you and see</i>

01:38:12.137 --> 01:38:17.177
<i>Deep in the forest there dragons will be</i>

01:38:18.394 --> 01:38:20.524
<i>They come from the Earth</i>

01:38:20.604 --> 01:38:24.904
<i>Yes, they come from the stone</i>

01:38:24.984 --> 01:38:27.364
<i>The icy, cold North</i>

01:38:27.444 --> 01:38:30.324
<i>That's where they call home</i>

01:38:31.782 --> 01:38:36.702
<i>Go where the mountain kisses the sea</i>

01:38:38.372 --> 01:38:43.132
<i>Better be brave
Far braver than me</i>

01:38:45.087 --> 01:38:50.877
<i>Look all around you and see</i>

01:38:51.635 --> 01:38:56.465
<i>Deep in the forest there dragons will be</i>

01:39:00.269 --> 01:39:02.899
<i>If a dragon should find you</i>

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:05.900
<i>You might ought to run</i>

01:39:06.859 --> 01:39:11.989
<i>No one has lived through
such a run-in, not one</i>

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.910
<i>So if you hear a roar</i>

01:39:15.993 --> 01:39:19.003
<i>Goodness sake, leave them be</i>

01:39:20.247 --> 01:39:23.327
<i>Up where you find them</i>

01:39:23.417 --> 01:39:26.457
<i>Wild and free</i>

01:39:28.172 --> 01:39:32.722

01:39:34.553 --> 01:39:39.683
<i>Deep in the forest there dragons will be</i>

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.730
<i>Look all around you</i>

01:39:43.812 --> 01:39:49.782
