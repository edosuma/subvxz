>> Ughhhh!
Physical contact!
>> Darwin: Just try and take

10:44.277 --> 10:47.746
some responsibilities for your
actions from time to time.
>> Never!

10:47.748 --> 10:50.915
>> Gumball: And maybe try to
laugh<i> with</i> people instead of
always laughing<i> at</i> them.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.652
>> Yeah. That's right.
Keep hoping.
>> Darwin: And try to remember

10:53.654 --> 10:55.820
that other people have hearts,
too.
>> Get bent!

10:55.822 --> 11:00.525
This is the Internet you're
talking to!
[ Both laugh ]

11:00.527 --> 11:01.559
>> Both: Meh.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.601
>> Gumball: Where are they?!
Where are they?!
Where are they?!

11:09.603 --> 11:12.404
>> Anais: Is it really that
important?
>> Gumball: Of course it is!

11:12.406 --> 11:16.041
This is crupac the barbarian!
Without his weapons, he's...
Crupac, the weird dude who hangs

11:16.043 --> 11:19.477
out in furry underpants and
looks like he's angrily trying
to shake hands with people.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.313
>> Anais: Like i said, is it
<i>really</i> that important?
>> Darwin: Hey, who's

11:22.315 --> 11:24.382
Daniel lennard?
>> Gumball: [ Scoffs ]
Who cares?!

11:24.384 --> 11:28.386
>> Anais:<i> Him,</i> apparently.
For mom?!
Look at all this stuff he sent

11:28.388 --> 11:31.856
her.
And listen to this -- "here's
another gift because your beauty

11:31.858 --> 11:36.728
and happiness is the most
important thing in my world.
Signed, Daniel lennard."

11:36.730 --> 11:38.963
That guy's trying to steal our
mom!
[ Both gasp ]

11:38.965 --> 11:42.500
>> Gumball: ¶ dun-dun-dun-duh ¶
>> Darwin: [ Gasps ]
>> Anais: We need to find him

11:42.502 --> 11:44.703
and make sure --
>> mom: What are you doing?!

11:45.838 --> 11:48.540
>> Gumball: What are<i> you</i> doing?
>> Mom: Showing you how angry i
am.

11:48.542 --> 11:52.577
If i had to pull a<i> real</i> frown
every time you guys misbehaved,
I'd be more wrinkly than a

11:52.579 --> 11:55.780
granny in a bath.
What are you doing spreading
trash all over the grass?!

11:55.782 --> 12:01.753
>> Gumball: Uhhhhhhhhhh...
Re...Cycling?
>> Mom: Really?

12:01.755 --> 12:06.157
>> All: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
>> Mom: [ Sighs ]
Then i guess it's all right.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.893
[ Door closes ]
>> Gumball: Oh, my gosh!
This is terrible!

12:08.895 --> 12:12.564
He's gonna steal mom!
[ Panting ]
I-i don't feel good.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.768
[ Woozily ] I think I'm gonna --
[ Whump! ]
[ Inhales deeply ]

12:16.770 --> 12:18.903
[ Chuckles ]
[ Normal voice ] Okay.
Sorry about that.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.474
I think I'm better n--
[ Woozily ] Oh, no.
I'm passing out again.

12:22.476 --> 12:25.844
[ Whump! ]
[ Inhales deeply ]
[ Chuckles ]

12:25.846 --> 12:28.680
[ Normal voice ] Okay.
I think I'm all right no--
[ Woozily ] Oh, nnungg...

12:28.682 --> 12:32.484
[ Whump! ]
>> Anais: We should have seen
this coming.

12:32.486 --> 12:35.520
She's a great mom.
Who<i> wouldn't</i> want her?
We have to do something before

12:35.522 --> 12:38.389
that guy steals her away!
>> Gumball: I've got a plan!
Uhh...

12:38.391 --> 12:41.192
[ Whump! ]
First, Darwin uses his man voice
to call mom, pretending to be

12:41.194 --> 12:44.062
her boss and tell her that she
has to go into work...
>> Darwin: [ Deep voice ] Hello,

12:44.064 --> 12:46.598
this is your boss from the place
you work.
>> Gumball: When she leaves the

12:46.600 --> 12:49.400
house, we hack into her e-mail
and send a message to
Daniel lennard posing as her to

12:49.402 --> 12:52.237
get him to agree to a secret
meeting in the park tonight.
Then we steal some of mom's

12:52.239 --> 12:54.706
clothes.
<i>Then</i> we break for lunch.
I'm thinking burritos.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.408
<i>Then</i> we sneak out of the house
with the clothes and cross down
to the park.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.611
Once there, you will tell
Daniel lennard that he's in
danger...

12:59.613 --> 13:02.714
>> Anais: You are in danger,
Daniel lennard.
>> Gumball: ...And that mom is a

13:02.716 --> 13:05.884
horrible, carnivorous monster
and you are the survivors of her
previous family.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.952
Then I'll attack him disguised
as mom...
Reeee!

13:07.954 --> 13:11.589
...scaring him away forever.
Boom!
>> Anais: Hm.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.526
That could work.
We need to make sure nothing can
go wrong.

13:14.528 --> 13:17.695
Let's go through this in detail.
Okay.
So, what exactly would Darwin

13:17.697 --> 13:20.465
say to mom?
[ Telephone rings ]
[ Telephone beeps ]

13:20.467 --> 13:24.969
>> Mom: Hello? Nicole watterson.
>> Darwin: [ Inhales ]
Uhhhhhh...

13:24.971 --> 13:28.640
>> Mom: Who is this?
>> Darwin: ...Hhhhhhhhh.
[ Pop! ]

13:28.642 --> 13:31.309
>> Anais: Okay.
So we call mom, and Darwin reads
what's on the paper.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.046
>> Mom: Hello? Nicole watterson.
>> Darwin: [ Deep voice ] Hello.
This is your boss from the place

13:35.048 --> 13:39.651
you work.
We need you to, uh --
[ Normal voice ] Uhhhhhh...

13:39.653 --> 13:41.252
[ Pop! ]
>> Gumball: [ Groans ]
Okay.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.489
So we write a script and then
call mom from a pay phone.
>> Darwin: [ Deep voice ] Hello!

13:44.491 --> 13:47.392
This is the boss from the place
you work.
We need you to come here right

13:47.394 --> 13:50.929
away, or you're fired!
>> Mom: Why? What's going on?
Is it the kobayashi account or

13:50.931 --> 13:55.600
is it the infrastructure problem
with the throughput outflow?
>> Darwin: [ Normal ] Uhhhhhh...

13:55.602 --> 13:58.102
[ Pop! ]
[ Whoosh! ]
>> Anais: Turn the page.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.939
>> Darwin: [ Deep voice ] It's
so serious, i can't discuss it
over the phone.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.741
Bye!
>> Mom: [ Gasps ]
[ Panting ]

14:03.743 --> 14:05.910
>> Gumball: Then i get to the
computer.
[ Door slams ]

14:05.912 --> 14:12.283
Hu! Hur! Eh! Ah! Hi-ah! Hur!
Ha ha!
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.652
>> Anais: Come on.
Let's be real for a minute.

14:15.821 --> 14:19.524
>> Gumball: Eh!
Ehh heh heh!
Hii-eh!

14:19.526 --> 14:22.527
Uah!
Hnnnng!
[ Whamp! ]

14:22.529 --> 14:26.331
[ Panting ]
Eah!
Nhah! Ngah! Ngah!

14:26.333 --> 14:29.367
[ Sniffing ]
Hah!
Okay. Then i --

14:29.369 --> 14:33.304
[ gulps ]
I'm s--
[ Gasping ]

14:33.306 --> 14:39.410
[ Sighs deeply ]
Hoo!
Then i break into mom's e-mail

14:39.412 --> 14:44.148
account.
"Dear Daniel lennard!"
>> Darwin: Dude, your caps lock

14:44.150 --> 14:46.517
is on!
>> Gumball: Oh. Sorry.
"Dear Daniel lennard, meet me at

14:46.519 --> 14:49.254
the park tonight.
It's mega-important, dude."
>> Anais: Oh, come on!

14:49.256 --> 14:51.923
Have you ever heard mom say
"mega" or "dude"?
>> Gumball: [ Sighs ]

14:51.925 --> 14:54.859
What would<i> you</i> say?
>> Anais: Just say it's an issue
of utmost importance.

14:54.861 --> 14:58.496
>> Gumball: [ Mockingly ] Ohhh!
Would you like me to cc the
queen of england, as well?

14:58.498 --> 15:01.199
[ Smack! ]
>> Anais: Just send the thing!
>> Gumball: [ Sighs ]

15:01.201 --> 15:03.801
"Forever yours, gumball."
>> Darwin: Dude!
You just signed it with your own

15:03.803 --> 15:05.970
name!
>> Gumball: Oh, come on!
I've already had to re-type this

15:05.972 --> 15:08.106
thing three times!
[ Sighs ]
All right.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.442
"Dear Daniel lennard, meet me at
the park tonight.
It's an issue of utmost

15:11.444 --> 15:14.078
importance.
Forever yours, mom."
>> Anais: Come on!

15:14.080 --> 15:18.116
Mom would never sign "mom."
She would sign her own name!
>> Gumball: Yeah. Sure.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.085
"Dear Daniel lennard,
nah-nah-nah.
Forever yours, Nicole."

15:21.087 --> 15:23.922
>> Anais: Wait!
What'd you put in the subject?
>> Gumball: Aaah!

15:23.924 --> 15:26.557
Can we just move on from the
e-mail bit?!
>> Anais: Come on.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.394
Every part of the plan has to be
foolproof.
>> Gumball: Eh-eh-eh-eh

15:29.396 --> 15:31.462
eh-eh-eh-eh...
All right. It's done.
I put "hello."

15:31.464 --> 15:33.498
Lunchtime!

15:35.367 --> 15:39.103
>> Darwin: Mm.
Burritos are nice, but they're
kind of messy.

15:39.105 --> 15:43.041
>> Gumball: Okay, next, we sneak
past dad to get to the park.
It should be easy -- he'll be

15:43.043 --> 15:45.710
asleep.
>> Dad: [ Sniffing ]
Hey!

15:45.712 --> 15:48.446
Where do you think you're going?
>> Darwin: Aah!
Why'd he wake up?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.682
>> Anais: He smelled us.
You wiped some sauce on
yourself.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.550
>> Gumball: ¶ lunchtime again ¶

15:54.687 --> 15:59.924
ah-bup-bup!
don't forget to use your napkin.
Okay, next, we sneak past dad to

15:59.926 --> 16:02.961
get to the park.
>> Dad: Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

16:02.963 --> 16:06.331
>> Darwin: Aah!
How is that even possible?!
He smelled it from<i> inside</i> us?

16:09.702 --> 16:12.737
[ Sighs ]
It's just not as good without
the sauce.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.908
[ Both panting ]
Why did you leave five hours to
run to a park that's only three

16:16.910 --> 16:19.677
blocks away?
>> Gumball: Because [Panting]
she's got no legs.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.246
They're more like feet coming
out of her butt.
>> Anais: Why don't we take

16:22.248 --> 16:25.183
bikes?
>> Gumball: Because...
...It's way funnier to watch you

16:25.185 --> 16:32.357
try to run.
>> Anais: [ Grunting ]
[ Panting ]

16:32.359 --> 16:35.660
Oh, man!
The park's closed!
[ Whump! ]

16:35.662 --> 16:39.330
Why didn't you get in when it
was open?!
>> Darwin: It was closed when we

16:39.332 --> 16:42.133
got here.
I've been waiting for four hours
for him to man up and jump.

16:42.135 --> 16:46.471
But he's too scared!
>> Gumball: I'm not scared!
I...Just don't want to do it.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.873
>> Darwin: You don't want to
because you're scared!
>> Gumball: Aah!

16:48.875 --> 16:51.776
No! Not c--
no! Not cool!
Okay! Okay!

16:51.778 --> 16:57.215
Fine! I'm doing it!
[ Exhales ]
Okay.

16:57.217 --> 17:01.786

Whaa!
[ High-pitched ] Oaaaaaaah!

17:01.788 --> 17:05.690
don't sit there! Help me out!
don't leave me hangi-i-i-ng!
Please, please!

17:05.692 --> 17:08.526
Somebody do something!
>> Anais: You do realize that
all this is just happening in

17:08.528 --> 17:11.429
your head, right?
>> Gumball: [ Normal ] Yeah, but
let's just go to the shop to buy

17:11.431 --> 17:15.233
some rope<i> before</i> we go to the
park, because I'm not going
through all that again.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.737
[ Whump! ]

17:22.307 --> 17:25.143
>> Anais: How did they get in
here when the gate is...
Wait!

17:25.145 --> 17:28.746
No one actually tried it?!
>> Gumball: It was shut!
>> Anais: A<i> shut</i> door isn't a

17:28.748 --> 17:31.682
<i>locked</i> door!
- I think we all learned that
after the granny jojo

17:31.684 --> 17:35.286
dressing-room incident.
>> Gumball: [ Shudders ]
What kind of weirdo gets dressed

17:35.288 --> 17:37.588
hat-first?
Anyway, which one is
Daniel lennard?

17:37.590 --> 17:40.625
>> Darwin: We'll know when we
see him, but right now, let's
just<i> imagine</i> what he would be.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.061
>> Gumball: Well, we already saw
from his note that he's pretty
slimy.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.496
[ Squish! ]
We also know he's rich, so he
must be full of bling.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.832
[ Squish! ]
>> Darwin: Also, he's probably
evil.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.934
[ Squish! ]
Mm. No. More evil.
[ Squish! ]

17:49.936 --> 17:53.738
No. Even<i> more</i> evil.
[ Squish! ]
Yeah. That's our Daniel lennard.

17:53.740 --> 17:58.776
[ Squish! Squish! Squish! ]
>> Gumball: Okay.
Everyone put on their disguises.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.613
>> Anais: Uh...Mr. Lennard?
>> [ High-pitched ] Yes?
Indeed.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.216
>> Anais: There's no way mom
would fall for a guy with a
voice like that.

18:05.218 --> 18:10.488
>> Darwin: Evil voice!
>> [ Evilly ] Yes, indeed?
>> Anais: Uh, we need to warn

18:10.490 --> 18:14.425
you, good sir.
>> Oh, but it's<i> you</i> who should
be warned.

18:14.427 --> 18:20.264

How does he know about our
plan?!

>> Because next time you plan to
get rid of me, don't write
"fake e-mail to Daniel lennard"

in the subject line!
