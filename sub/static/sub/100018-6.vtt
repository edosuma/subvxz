<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.176 --> 00:23.344
Say goodbye to your friend.

00:26.614 --> 00:27.682
No!

00:27.716 --> 00:31.353
Give me your hand.

00:31.385 --> 00:34.055
Don't let go.

01:06.989 --> 01:09.058
<i>Imagine community...</i>

02:02.376 --> 02:04.146
"Krypto."

02:04.179 --> 02:06.581
Okay, Krypto.

02:06.614 --> 02:09.584
And I guess I'm...

02:09.616 --> 02:13.822
"Conner."

02:50.292 --> 02:54.042
You ready, boy?

03:10.412 --> 03:12.896
I don't know why
you had to pound on my door

03:12.897 --> 03:13.959
at 6:00 a.m.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.684
Because I called your apartment,

03:15.685 --> 03:18.319
I called your cell,
I texted you.

03:18.354 --> 03:19.497
Where the hell were you
all night?

03:19.521 --> 03:21.156
None of your goddamn business.

03:21.189 --> 03:22.790
Could you please stop yelling?

03:22.824 --> 03:23.891
I wasn't yelling.

03:23.925 --> 03:25.961
Jesus. Do you have any aspirin?

03:25.993 --> 03:29.532
Aspirin's not gonna fix this.

03:29.564 --> 03:32.534
You've gotta be
fucking kiddin' me.

03:32.568 --> 03:35.638
Eight lab personnel,
three security guards...

03:35.670 --> 03:37.439
all in the hospital,
all critical.

03:37.473 --> 03:39.641
- Where is...
- Subject 13?

03:39.675 --> 03:41.453
He's gone. Who the hell
do you think did all this?

03:41.477 --> 03:43.780
That's impossible.
How could that happen?

03:43.812 --> 03:46.848
That's what
you're supposed to tell us.

03:46.882 --> 03:47.983
Looks like someone got up

03:48.015 --> 03:51.552
on the wrong side
of the glass tube...

03:51.586 --> 03:52.822
Mercy Graves.

03:52.854 --> 03:54.990
Personal Security Specialist
to Mr. Luthor.

03:55.022 --> 03:57.658
Yes, I've heard of you, Ms. Graves.

03:57.692 --> 03:58.764
I'm Walter Hawn,

03:58.765 --> 04:01.062
Vice President
of Special Projects,

04:01.096 --> 04:04.467
- and this is...
- I know who she is.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.635
Big night, I see.

04:06.669 --> 04:09.504
Chanel or Chardonnay?

04:09.538 --> 04:11.640
What the hell are you doing here?

04:11.674 --> 04:14.443
You've got a real problem
on your hands.

04:14.477 --> 04:17.079
Mr. Luthor wants answers.

04:17.112 --> 04:19.148
And he wants his experiment back.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.483
Well, I'll just let you two...

04:20.516 --> 04:23.145
This thing you created
must've been triggered by something.

04:23.146 --> 04:24.463
I'm assuming you know
what that might've been?

04:24.487 --> 04:29.290
Actually, uh, Eve's the expert
on genetics and cloning, so...

04:31.560 --> 04:34.362
Where'd your boy go, Doctor?

04:34.396 --> 04:38.966
If we're lucky,
he's scared and hiding.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.235
And if we're not?

04:40.269 --> 04:41.870
That's harder.

04:41.903 --> 04:44.415
Our predictions have him at the
emotional age of a two-year-old,

04:44.439 --> 04:48.776
so he's feeling fear,
curiosity, anger...

04:48.810 --> 04:52.113
<i>confusion, wonder,</i>

04:52.146 --> 04:54.249
<i>everything that
he is experiencing</i>

04:54.283 --> 04:59.283
<i>is for the very first time.</i>

04:59.321 --> 05:00.889
<i>Mentally, emotionally,</i>

05:00.922 --> 05:04.660
<i>psychologically, he's a child.</i>

05:04.694 --> 05:08.564
<i>He's absorbing the world
like a sponge,</i>

05:08.596 --> 05:13.435
<i>sights, smells, sounds...</i>

05:13.468 --> 05:15.301
<i>Even the people he meets
will have an effect</i>

05:15.302 --> 05:19.920
<i>on his future behavior.</i>

06:27.776 --> 06:29.278
Hey!

06:29.310 --> 06:32.581
What the hell's
the matter with you?

06:32.615 --> 06:34.350
What the hell's
the matter with you?

06:34.382 --> 06:36.351
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

06:36.384 --> 06:37.886
Take it easy.

06:37.918 --> 06:39.355
If you want this shirt,

06:39.387 --> 06:44.059
it costs money.
12.50 or, uh, two for 25.

06:44.091 --> 06:49.031
We don't have any money.

06:49.064 --> 06:53.113
Then come back when you do.

06:58.908 --> 07:00.843
So you think
he's making any friends out there?

07:00.877 --> 07:03.846
The only thing we know
about his personality is this.

07:03.879 --> 07:06.382
He was clearly
in a hurry to get out of here.

07:06.415 --> 07:08.317
Where'd he want to get to
so badly?

07:08.350 --> 07:10.319
I'm not sure, but his memories

07:10.351 --> 07:12.521
might be the best clue
that we have.

07:12.555 --> 07:15.257
What memories?
He's been alive for all of ten hours.

07:15.290 --> 07:16.725
Due to the DNA-cloning process,

07:16.759 --> 07:18.593
he might have
epigenetic memories,

07:18.627 --> 07:21.963
actual memories from the lives
of the two men who made him.

07:21.997 --> 07:24.500
Some of those memories
might be pleasant, others less so.

07:24.533 --> 07:29.533
The flood of emotion could make him
unstable and even dangerous.

07:34.509 --> 07:36.512
Come on.

07:36.545 --> 07:37.812
Please, stop! No!

07:37.846 --> 07:39.548
Stay here, Krypto.

07:39.581 --> 07:41.250
Give me your wallet. Now!

07:41.283 --> 07:43.129
What the hell's
the matter with you?

07:49.692 --> 07:51.627
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.605
Thank you. He was trying
to steal my money and I...

07:53.629 --> 07:57.165
- You have money?
- Well, yes.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.170
Can I have your money?

08:04.540 --> 08:07.041
Don't hurt me!

08:07.074 --> 08:08.648
Thanks.

08:10.879 --> 08:13.716
So, let's say we do find him.

08:13.749 --> 08:16.760
Who or what will we be facing?

08:16.761 --> 08:17.813
We don't know.

08:17.814 --> 08:19.957
We thought we would have
a year with him after incubation.

08:19.958 --> 08:23.391
That would have given us time
to observe him and to learn from him,

08:23.425 --> 08:25.259
and to teach him
about the outside world,

08:25.293 --> 08:26.427
I mean...

08:26.461 --> 08:27.797
I guess we'll see.

08:27.829 --> 08:30.342
We've got a potential murderer
walking around out there,

08:30.343 --> 08:32.735
with our technological
fingerprints all over him.

08:33.436 --> 08:34.602
Our boss wants answers.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.014
"We'll see"
just isn't gonna cut it.

08:36.038 --> 08:37.740
Okay. Well, you can
remind our boss

08:37.773 --> 08:39.875
that he initiated this project
without my knowledge.

08:39.908 --> 08:42.477
When I found out, I warned him
of the potential dangers,

08:42.510 --> 08:43.645
and he ignored me.

08:43.678 --> 08:45.224
"We'll see" was good enough
for him then.

08:45.248 --> 08:47.515
So, I guess he's gonna
have to live with it now.

08:47.548 --> 08:50.753
Either way, we gotta bring
Subject 13 in.

08:50.785 --> 08:53.621
So, tell me what you need
to get that done...

08:53.655 --> 08:56.658
and it's yours.

08:56.692 --> 08:59.961
We'll need your team.

08:59.995 --> 09:02.062
My pleasure.

09:02.096 --> 09:05.232
They'll need briefing.

09:05.267 --> 09:09.317
And you might wanna change.

09:17.779 --> 09:21.549
You'll be hunting the world's
most dangerous infant.

09:21.582 --> 09:23.652
And I think it is safe to say

09:23.686 --> 09:25.986
he has not had his nap.

09:28.023 --> 09:29.792
That's funny.

09:29.825 --> 09:32.028
You know what else is funny?

09:32.061 --> 09:33.629
I'm interviewing
replacements today,

09:33.662 --> 09:35.798
'cause not all of you
are coming back.

09:35.831 --> 09:38.734
The goal is to subdue him
by whatever means necessary.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.134
Does that include killing him?

09:40.168 --> 09:42.738
No. Are we clear on that?

09:42.770 --> 09:44.340
I want that to be really clear.

09:44.374 --> 09:47.809
We're talking about six years
and $40 million worth of science.

09:47.842 --> 09:50.077
We have a lot left
to learn from him,

09:50.110 --> 09:51.880
and I want to learn it.

09:51.913 --> 09:56.913
That means I need him back
in one piece.

09:57.385 --> 09:59.721
Load up.

09:59.754 --> 10:01.447
Good luck with them.

10:03.924 --> 10:04.960
What?

10:04.961 --> 10:06.394
You're going with them.

10:06.427 --> 10:07.562
Field ops is your job.

10:07.596 --> 10:10.399
They need your expertise
on the ground.

10:10.432 --> 10:13.101
That's what FaceTime is for.

10:13.135 --> 10:16.132
You spent the last six years
of your life working on this project...

10:16.133 --> 10:18.506
day and night.

10:18.539 --> 10:23.278
No partner, no kids,
not even a dog.

10:23.312 --> 10:24.980
It's been your one true love.

10:25.014 --> 10:26.881
And now, after all that sacrifice,

10:26.916 --> 10:29.384
you're telling me
you don't want to meet him?

10:29.418 --> 10:31.586
To finally look into his eyes
and know what it is

10:31.620 --> 10:36.457
you gave everything up for?

10:36.491 --> 10:41.491
I sure hope he's worth it.

10:56.745 --> 11:00.195
Come on, boy. Let's go.

11:04.919 --> 11:08.657
They're coming for us, Krypto.

11:08.691 --> 11:12.291
We gotta get outta here.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.203
Clark?

11:22.236 --> 11:23.567
Clark.

11:32.279 --> 11:34.582
Come on, buddy.

11:34.615 --> 11:37.166
We're going home.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.952
Okay, watch your step.

11:40.462 --> 11:41.517
Take care now.

11:45.293 --> 11:47.663
Krypto...

11:47.696 --> 11:49.697
I have a feeling
we're in Kansas.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.803
Come on.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.456
Come on, Krypto. This is it.

12:17.592 --> 12:18.793
Come on.

12:38.078 --> 12:40.849
Hello?

12:40.883 --> 12:43.952
Someone there?

12:43.985 --> 12:48.423
I think I used to live here.

12:48.456 --> 12:51.259
What's your name?

12:51.293 --> 12:53.828
Conner.

12:53.861 --> 12:57.466
I never knew a Conner.

12:57.499 --> 13:00.535
But I'm glad I do now.

13:00.570 --> 13:05.570
Would you and your dog like to
come in out of the rain?

13:10.245 --> 13:11.644
Okay.

13:24.759 --> 13:28.210
I'll put the kettle on.

13:31.533 --> 13:36.533
- It's different than it used to be.
- Is it?

13:39.807 --> 13:42.711
The kitchen should be over there.

13:42.745 --> 13:46.115
And a staircase.

13:46.148 --> 13:50.686
And there should be
a big red barn out back.

13:50.719 --> 13:52.620
And a windmill.

13:52.653 --> 13:54.789
That sounds like
the old Kent place,

13:54.822 --> 13:57.458
a few miles down the road.

13:57.491 --> 13:58.860
Clark.

13:58.894 --> 14:00.363
That's right. Clark Kent.

14:00.395 --> 14:02.697
He was a friend
of my son Alexander's.

14:02.730 --> 14:05.500
Lex Luthor.

14:05.533 --> 14:10.033
He was always Alexander to me.

14:14.376 --> 14:17.511
Alexander never did
have many friends.

14:17.546 --> 14:19.215
I used to say to him,

14:19.248 --> 14:24.248
"Alexander, friends are harder
to come by than money."

14:24.320 --> 14:29.120
I do believe that.

14:30.091 --> 14:33.928
It's certainly been
true for him, I'm afraid.

14:33.962 --> 14:36.697
Whoo!

14:36.731 --> 14:39.500
What the hell's
the matter with you?

14:39.533 --> 14:41.570
Sorry.

14:41.602 --> 14:42.904
It was an accident.

14:42.937 --> 14:46.307
It happens more and more nowadays.

14:52.047 --> 14:54.216
I love this little town.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.919
I expect to be here
until the day I die.

14:57.952 --> 15:00.089
Uh, but Alexander...

15:00.121 --> 15:02.389
He moved to Metropolis
the minute he could.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.792
Why?

15:03.826 --> 15:06.794
Some people have a thing
inside them...

15:06.828 --> 15:10.099
ambition, uh, purpose,
a calling.

15:10.131 --> 15:14.003
It makes them feel larger
than they really are.

15:14.035 --> 15:15.937
So they need to be
in a large place

15:15.971 --> 15:20.509
so they don't feel...
smothered.

15:20.543 --> 15:23.346
There's a bottle of brandy
on the counter over there.

15:23.379 --> 15:27.081
I allow myself a small glass
after dinner.

15:27.115 --> 15:31.015
Would you care to join me?

15:45.533 --> 15:47.335
To new friends.

15:47.369 --> 15:48.418
Cheers.

15:55.577 --> 15:59.048
Take a look in that cabinet
over there.

15:59.081 --> 16:01.615
He was a brilliant child.

16:01.649 --> 16:04.119
So gifted.

16:04.153 --> 16:06.788
- You're proud of him?
- Yes, very.

16:06.822 --> 16:09.256
He's a scientist...

16:09.289 --> 16:10.792
like I was.

16:10.826 --> 16:12.927
But even as a child,

16:12.961 --> 16:17.961
he was far beyond anything
I could ever hope to be.

16:18.100 --> 16:22.671
Then why did you beat him?

16:22.703 --> 16:26.274
Is that what he told you?

16:26.307 --> 16:29.077
- Because it's a goddamn lie.
- No, it isn't.

16:29.110 --> 16:32.081
I don't know who you are.

16:32.114 --> 16:34.615
Or what you wanted coming here.

16:34.649 --> 16:35.716
I'm not sure either.

16:35.750 --> 16:39.650
I would like you to leave.

16:42.758 --> 16:45.660
Alexander was a difficult child.

16:45.693 --> 16:49.297
Stubborn.

16:49.331 --> 16:52.934
Arrogant.

16:52.967 --> 16:55.270
He was a genius.

16:55.303 --> 16:59.474
But... he was
missing something.

16:59.508 --> 17:02.977
Inside. A moral compass.

17:03.011 --> 17:04.746
A sense of right or wrong.

17:04.779 --> 17:05.980
How do you know that?

17:06.015 --> 17:08.518
Because it's true.
I mean, I tried to teach him.

17:08.550 --> 17:12.654
But he couldn't be taught.
He wouldn't be taught!

17:12.689 --> 17:14.990
It was as if he knew
what I was trying to do,

17:15.022 --> 17:16.558
and he actively resisted me.

17:16.592 --> 17:19.260
- Maybe he was scared.
- He never cried.

17:19.295 --> 17:23.065
No matter how long it went on.

17:23.097 --> 17:27.303
He would just... stare at me.

17:27.336 --> 17:30.005
- With contempt.
- You deserved it.

17:30.038 --> 17:31.940
He would've done anything
for your approval.

17:31.973 --> 17:34.809
He never cared
for anyone's approval.

17:34.843 --> 17:39.413
I cared about yours!

17:39.446 --> 17:42.684
Who are you?

17:42.719 --> 17:44.362
- Everybody get down!
- On the ground, now!

17:44.386 --> 17:46.154
Nobody move!

17:46.188 --> 17:47.757
Down, boy.

17:47.789 --> 17:50.826
What in God's name's going on?
You can't come into my house,

17:50.858 --> 17:52.027
order people around!

17:52.060 --> 17:53.662
<i>Quiet!</i>

17:53.694 --> 17:56.231
Hey!

17:56.265 --> 18:00.169
- Shut up.
- Stop that. What are you doing?

18:06.409 --> 18:08.911
<i>Fire, fire, fire!</i>

18:08.943 --> 18:10.746
What? No, stop that!

18:27.730 --> 18:31.114
Stand down, God damn it!
I said stand down!

18:32.666 --> 18:35.903
Freeze!

19:20.281 --> 19:22.190
Subject targeted. Firing.

19:33.162 --> 19:36.157
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

19:55.684 --> 20:00.484
No...
No, no, no...

20:34.855 --> 20:37.292
Please don't kill me.

20:37.326 --> 20:39.295
Who are you?

20:39.327 --> 20:41.896
My name is Eve Watson.

20:41.930 --> 20:43.765
Are you with them?

20:43.798 --> 20:45.867
I work for Cadmus Labs.

20:45.902 --> 20:47.836
But I did not want them
to hurt you. They...

20:47.869 --> 20:49.782
They should not have
shot at you. That was wrong.

20:49.806 --> 20:53.342
- Then why did they?
- I told them not to, but...

20:53.375 --> 20:56.510
I think they were afraid of you.

20:56.544 --> 20:57.747
Why?

20:57.779 --> 21:02.750
Because they'd never seen
anything like you.

21:02.784 --> 21:05.820
What am I?

21:05.854 --> 21:07.804
Can I just...

21:21.537 --> 21:23.539
You...

21:23.540 --> 21:25.586
are a genetic clone.

21:27.509 --> 21:30.077
You were designed...

21:30.112 --> 21:31.913
with the whole...
My whole point

21:31.948 --> 21:34.349
was to see if I could
actually create a person...

21:34.383 --> 21:35.817
You created me?

21:35.852 --> 21:38.855
You were created the way
that every person is,

21:38.887 --> 21:42.324
the genetic material
of two different people blended together.

21:42.357 --> 21:46.327
So, you and who else?

21:46.362 --> 21:48.631
Well, no. Not me.

21:48.663 --> 21:50.365
In your case, it was two men.

21:50.398 --> 21:52.733
Well, one man and one Superman.

21:52.767 --> 21:55.767
Who is the Superman?

21:57.972 --> 22:01.123
Superman.

22:09.585 --> 22:13.020
People like Superman.

22:13.055 --> 22:15.156
- He saves people.
- Yes.

22:15.190 --> 22:19.193
Yes, people love Superman.

22:19.228 --> 22:21.096
Who is my other dad?

22:21.128 --> 22:23.030
His name is Lex Luthor.

22:23.065 --> 22:27.569
He's very smart, and...

22:27.603 --> 22:32.140
Well, he's very smart.

22:32.173 --> 22:33.842
People don't love him, do they?

22:39.448 --> 22:41.115
We don't have much time.

22:41.148 --> 22:42.651
They're gonna send others.

22:42.684 --> 22:45.787
If they get me,
what will they do to me?

22:45.819 --> 22:46.989
I don't know.

22:47.022 --> 22:49.124
Before tonight, I thought
they would've given me

22:49.156 --> 22:51.460
more time to study you.

22:51.492 --> 22:53.327
I wanted time to teach you.

22:53.362 --> 22:55.263
I wanted time to learn from you.

22:55.297 --> 22:58.400
Is that what'll happen
if we go back with them?

22:58.433 --> 23:00.075
No, I don't think so.

23:00.076 --> 23:02.203
Will they let me
meet my fathers?

23:02.237 --> 23:05.339
Superman doesn't even
know you exist.

23:05.374 --> 23:07.075
And you really don't wanna meet
Lex Luthor.

23:07.108 --> 23:08.943
Yes, I do.

23:08.977 --> 23:11.346
I have to meet him.

23:11.380 --> 23:14.883
I need to know who I am.

23:21.856 --> 23:24.092
You know what?

23:24.125 --> 23:26.061
Fuck Cadmus.

23:26.095 --> 23:30.465
We can either sit here
and let them take us...

23:30.499 --> 23:33.868
or we can hit the road.

23:43.479 --> 23:45.513
Where are we going?

23:45.548 --> 23:47.650
I have a cabin up at Lake Kipling.

23:47.682 --> 23:49.250
Nobody knows about it.

23:49.284 --> 23:52.153
I suppose that could
buy us a day or so.

23:52.186 --> 23:55.624
Was it your idea to make me?

23:55.657 --> 23:57.259
I have a PhD in genetics.

23:57.292 --> 24:00.996
I was hired by Cadmus to study
the theoretical possibilities

24:01.028 --> 24:05.099
of cross-species cloning.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.568
Okay, let me make this simple.

24:06.602 --> 24:09.704
I came up with the plan
to design someone like you,

24:09.739 --> 24:12.973
but I never expected for them
to actually do it.

24:13.008 --> 24:15.510
So, making me was wrong?

24:16.778 --> 24:19.281
No. I mean,
it's not that simple,

24:19.315 --> 24:24.315
There's no such thing
as a bad scientific experiment.

24:24.452 --> 24:28.490
You know, I mean,
take nuclear fission.

24:28.523 --> 24:30.159
Sorry, that might be
a little beyond...

24:30.192 --> 24:32.961
Nuclear fission is a form of
elemental transmutation

24:32.994 --> 24:36.865
in which the nucleus of an atom
splits into two or more smaller nuclei.

24:36.898 --> 24:39.535
The by-products include
free neutrons, photons

24:39.567 --> 24:41.836
in the form of gamma rays,
and other nuclear fragments

24:41.871 --> 24:45.441
such as alpha
and beta particles.

24:45.473 --> 24:47.909
How did you do that?

24:47.942 --> 24:50.145
I don't know.

24:50.179 --> 24:52.913
Feel like I just... remembered it.

24:52.948 --> 24:55.550
So...

24:55.584 --> 24:59.320
It's not just memories.
You have epigenetic knowledge.

24:59.354 --> 25:01.589
Some of the things that
your fathers knew,

25:01.624 --> 25:03.592
you're gonna know, too.

25:03.625 --> 25:06.729
So, nuclear fission is...

25:06.761 --> 25:11.761
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

25:13.635 --> 25:15.904
I don't know.

25:15.938 --> 25:18.240
One thing I do know is,

25:18.273 --> 25:20.476
when I found out what they were
at doing at Cadmus,

25:20.509 --> 25:22.344
that they were developing you,
I stayed.

25:22.376 --> 25:24.747
I could've left, but I didn't.

25:24.779 --> 25:29.550
I decided that I was going to be
the one moral, decent human being

25:29.585 --> 25:32.386
still involved.

25:32.421 --> 25:35.356
- You didn't abandon me?
- No, I didn't.

25:38.226 --> 25:40.561
Can I call you "Mom"?

25:40.596 --> 25:42.448
Don't be a smart-mouth.

25:45.934 --> 25:47.402
There's some damage
to the house,

25:47.435 --> 25:49.570
but rest assured,
your father is fine...

25:49.605 --> 25:52.473
I don't know,
I'll get an estimate.

25:52.508 --> 25:55.309
No, they're in the wind,
both of them.

25:55.344 --> 25:57.613
But don't worry, Mr. Luthor,

25:57.645 --> 26:00.516
we're tracking them
even as we speak.

26:02.451 --> 26:06.055
I know, I'm hungry, too, buddy.

26:06.087 --> 26:08.289
Maybe she'll bring us
some hot dogs.

26:08.323 --> 26:11.226
Get it? "Hot dogs"?

26:11.259 --> 26:14.630
"Dogs," get it?

26:14.663 --> 26:17.465
Get back in the car!

26:17.499 --> 26:18.800
Stop it!

26:18.834 --> 26:22.637
Get your hands off of me!

26:28.843 --> 26:29.911
Hey.

26:29.943 --> 26:31.613
Hey, hey, don't.

26:31.646 --> 26:33.382
- He's hurting her.
- Just let it go.

26:33.414 --> 26:37.164
- Why?
- Because I said so.

26:50.833 --> 26:52.268
- You should've let me help.
- Nope.

26:52.301 --> 26:54.435
Because if you make a scene,
then Cadmus finds us

26:54.470 --> 26:55.871
- that much faster.
- So what?

26:55.904 --> 26:57.740
I don't care.
And you're not my mom!

26:57.772 --> 27:01.210
You're damn right I'm not.

27:01.243 --> 27:04.211
All right, there's a word,
"consequences."

27:04.246 --> 27:06.147
Do you know what that means?

27:06.181 --> 27:07.182
No.

27:07.214 --> 27:08.717
I didn't think so.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.619
Okay, consequences
are the shitty things that happen

27:11.653 --> 27:13.823
when you make stupid decisions
without thinking.

27:13.855 --> 27:17.506
- I can do whatever I want.
- No, you can't, that's the problem.

27:17.507 --> 27:19.925
You don't have the maturity to do
what's in your best interest.

27:19.926 --> 27:23.131
Fine, then I'm leaving.

27:23.164 --> 27:24.666
Come on, buddy.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.634
Don't you dare!

27:26.669 --> 27:31.669
You come right back here, now.
Both of you!

27:34.143 --> 27:36.045
This is exactly
the sort of behavior

27:36.077 --> 27:38.913
that's gonna get you in trouble.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.615
What were you gonna do
to that guy, huh?

27:40.648 --> 27:42.328
I was gonna make him
leave his girlfriend alone.

27:42.352 --> 27:44.787
How? Were you gonna throw him
through a wall?

27:44.819 --> 27:46.488
- Maybe.
- Were you gonna kill him?

27:46.521 --> 27:47.613
I don't know!

27:47.614 --> 27:51.643
Know!

27:55.063 --> 27:58.099
Okay. Okay. Fine.

27:58.134 --> 28:03.134
You wanna know who you are?
What you are?

28:03.337 --> 28:05.507
Let's go.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.891
Go where?

28:11.680 --> 28:14.529
I'm gonna show you.

28:20.722 --> 28:22.972
Come on, buddy.

28:46.682 --> 28:48.517
What are you doing?

28:48.549 --> 28:51.385
Having breakfast.
You want some?

28:51.420 --> 28:54.720
It smells like brandy.

28:57.992 --> 29:00.561
Why are you drinking that stuff?

29:02.765 --> 29:04.032
This is what grown-ups do

29:04.066 --> 29:09.066
when they don't like the way
that they're feeling.

29:11.373 --> 29:14.509
Where are we?

29:14.542 --> 29:17.242
Cadmus Industries.

29:19.882 --> 29:23.632
A better future tomorrow.

29:25.252 --> 29:28.403
Welcome home, Conner.

29:50.045 --> 29:51.480
What happened here?

29:51.512 --> 29:54.415
There was
an isobutylene explosion.

29:54.449 --> 29:56.451
Fumes were highly toxic.

29:56.486 --> 30:00.689
Sixteen people were killed
and the entire facility was condemned.

30:00.722 --> 30:02.691
What was this place?

30:02.724 --> 30:05.094
It was a chemical factory and lab.

30:05.126 --> 30:10.126
Walter Hawn used to say this was
where the devil's work got done.

30:10.232 --> 30:14.036
The fire alarm went off
just after lunch.

30:14.069 --> 30:16.071
Everyone was evacuated.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.882
We thought we'd be back
within a couple of days

30:17.906 --> 30:20.808
and things would go back
to normal, but they never did.

30:20.843 --> 30:22.944
I don't understand.

30:22.978 --> 30:24.946
What are we doing here?

30:24.980 --> 30:27.449
I wanted to meet Lex Luthor.

30:27.481 --> 30:29.483
That's why we're here.

30:29.518 --> 30:31.553
This place?

30:31.586 --> 30:34.436
This is Lex Luthor.

30:48.871 --> 30:50.372
"Project Rakshasa"?

30:50.404 --> 30:51.973
Don't ask.

30:52.007 --> 30:53.308
Was it something bad?

30:53.342 --> 30:55.678
Lex Luthor used to say,

30:55.711 --> 30:59.714
"Knowledge is a fire that once lit
can never be extinguished."

30:59.748 --> 31:01.384
He thought he was being clever.

31:01.416 --> 31:04.386
He was mangling the words of the man
who invented the atomic bomb.

31:04.420 --> 31:07.556
"Knowledge is a fire that,
absent of morality,

31:07.588 --> 31:09.392
will consume us all."

31:09.424 --> 31:12.560
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna leave.

31:12.594 --> 31:14.329
I lied to you, Conner.

31:14.363 --> 31:15.608
I told you that there's
no such thing

31:15.632 --> 31:19.034
as a bad science experiment.
Of course there is.

31:19.067 --> 31:24.038
Tuskegee, MK-Ultra,
the Nazis, and this.

31:24.073 --> 31:27.608
Eve Watson's
Nobel Prize-losing work.

31:27.643 --> 31:31.546
Stop...

31:31.579 --> 31:34.150
doing that!

31:34.182 --> 31:35.951
Lex Luthor wanted
to clone Superman,

31:35.984 --> 31:38.988
but he just couldn't
figure out how.

31:39.020 --> 31:42.124
I told him he need to use
human genes

31:42.157 --> 31:46.028
to stabilize the alien ones.

31:46.060 --> 31:51.060
I gave him the idea to use
his own DNA to create you!

31:52.733 --> 31:54.603
You're saying I'm bad?

31:54.635 --> 31:56.570
No.

31:56.605 --> 32:00.808
I'm saying I am.

32:00.843 --> 32:04.012
I had so many chances

32:04.046 --> 32:05.913
to go against Cadmus.

32:05.948 --> 32:07.482
I could've left.

32:07.517 --> 32:09.518
I could've tried harder
to stop them,

32:09.550 --> 32:12.488
but I didn't.

32:12.521 --> 32:14.957
I told myself there would be
at least one good person

32:14.990 --> 32:16.358
involved in this project,

32:16.392 --> 32:18.126
but I'm no better
than Lex Luthor,

32:18.160 --> 32:20.229
because when it comes
right down to it,

32:20.261 --> 32:25.261
I just wanted to see
if we could do it.

32:25.968 --> 32:28.470
I don't think you're bad.

32:28.502 --> 32:33.041
I just wanna leave.

32:33.075 --> 32:35.044
You said you wanted to know
who you are

32:35.076 --> 32:38.247
and where you come from.

32:38.279 --> 32:41.983
All the answers
that you're looking for...

32:42.017 --> 32:45.953
are on the other side
of that door.

32:45.988 --> 32:50.092
You're the only person
who could possibly open it.

32:50.125 --> 32:55.125
But, kiddo,
I really suggest you don't.

33:14.583 --> 33:16.518
I have to.

35:08.264 --> 35:11.414
I know what I am now.

35:19.108 --> 35:20.141
Conner...

35:20.175 --> 35:23.112
What the hell's
the matter with you?

35:33.556 --> 35:38.126
That's why you brought me here.

35:38.159 --> 35:42.809
You wanted me to see what I am.

35:44.599 --> 35:46.402
I'm a monster.

35:46.434 --> 35:50.172
I didn't bring you here
to shame you.

35:50.204 --> 35:53.775
I brought you here to warn you.

35:53.809 --> 35:56.110
You're not Lex Luthor.

35:56.144 --> 35:58.880
And you're not Superman.

35:58.914 --> 36:00.548
You're both...

36:00.583 --> 36:03.918
which means you have to be
very careful.

36:03.952 --> 36:07.088
I'm sorry.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.490
I just...

36:09.523 --> 36:13.728
I got so mad.

36:13.762 --> 36:16.030
I know.

36:16.063 --> 36:19.233
Sometimes that anger
will be yours.

36:19.268 --> 36:23.172
And sometimes, it will be his.

36:23.204 --> 36:24.940
And either way,
you have got to learn

36:24.972 --> 36:28.643
how to control it.

36:28.677 --> 36:33.583
When you woke up yesterday...

36:33.615 --> 36:36.585
why did you attack
those scientists?

36:36.619 --> 36:41.590
I heard someone howling in pain.

36:41.623 --> 36:45.393
It was Krypto.
They were experimenting on him.

36:45.427 --> 36:47.929
I wanted to make it stop.

36:47.963 --> 36:49.331
And when those men from Cadmus

36:49.364 --> 36:52.400
tried to capture you last night...

36:52.434 --> 36:54.536
why did you kill them?

36:54.570 --> 36:56.606
They were hurting the old man.

36:56.639 --> 36:58.873
He was helpless.
It wasn't fair.

36:58.907 --> 37:02.378
See?

37:02.411 --> 37:05.246
You're not a monster.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.717
You're a person.

37:08.750 --> 37:12.121
What does that mean?

37:12.153 --> 37:14.103
That means...

37:21.597 --> 37:25.099
Your life is going to be difficult

37:25.134 --> 37:29.333
and complicated and painful.

37:30.371 --> 37:34.271
And sometimes full of joy.

37:36.545 --> 37:41.282
Just remember people are not
what they say they're going to do,

37:41.317 --> 37:44.617
they are what they do.

37:46.855 --> 37:48.923
So, what should I do?

37:48.956 --> 37:51.360
Run.

37:51.393 --> 37:53.161
Don't put down roots.

37:53.195 --> 37:54.795
Be careful who you trust.

37:54.829 --> 37:56.164
Don't use your powers

37:56.197 --> 37:58.065
because that will draw
attention to you.

37:58.099 --> 38:00.902
And for you,
that is a bad thing.

38:00.936 --> 38:04.239
And above all...

38:04.273 --> 38:06.842
don't be a hero.

38:09.478 --> 38:11.213
It's time to start running.

38:11.246 --> 38:14.750
No. I can't leave you here.

38:14.784 --> 38:16.686
- They'll kill you.
- What are you gonna do?

38:16.719 --> 38:18.920
Save my life
by killing all of them?

38:18.954 --> 38:22.023
<i>But you said they made you bad.</i>

38:22.056 --> 38:25.460
They didn't make me bad.

38:25.494 --> 38:27.929
You have a chance to be good.

38:27.963 --> 38:30.097
To be better than I am.

38:30.132 --> 38:32.166
<i>You have to get out of here.</i>

38:32.201 --> 38:36.070
I don't wanna leave you.

38:36.103 --> 38:37.329
Go.

38:46.181 --> 38:47.782
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

38:47.817 --> 38:52.817
He tried to kill me.
I begged for my life.

38:57.059 --> 38:58.927
Bullshit.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.498
This time...

39:02.530 --> 39:05.831
we're doing it my way.

39:10.239 --> 39:11.588
Let's go.

39:23.184 --> 39:25.885
No, boy. We can't.

39:42.737 --> 39:43.936
Hang on.

39:49.311 --> 39:51.860
No!

40:08.896 --> 40:10.666
Who the fuck are you?

40:10.699 --> 40:14.150
I'm not super sure yet.

40:29.016 --> 40:32.086
Whoever you are...

40:32.119 --> 40:35.423
I don't know how to thank you.

40:35.456 --> 40:37.893
I'm just glad I could help.

40:44.365 --> 40:46.235
Hey.

40:48.269 --> 40:49.804
Jason?

40:52.106 --> 40:53.409
What happened?

40:53.442 --> 40:58.442
This guy just saved my life.
