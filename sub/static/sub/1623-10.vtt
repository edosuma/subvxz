an army!

00:06.840 --> 00:08.000
Twelve's not a primary.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.215
Traveling through time is killing me,
isn't it?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.880
- Yes.
- How many jumps have I got left?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.513
Not as many as I'd like.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.719
Why are you doing this?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.590
Cos you're important.
We have plans for you.

- Jose, this is Sam. Your son.
- Hello.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.678
- You gotta stop.
- I watched her die.

no future. Your son's already dead.

we got the new core from Spearhead.

00:38.789 --> 00:45.080

successful. Mr Cole is now in 2015.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.692
- She sent you?
- Yeah.

Are you lying to me, Mr Ramse?

01:21.582 --> 01:22.617
Yeah.

- I got it. Skydiving.
- I don't know. It's kinda played.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.018
Have you everjumped out of a plane?

02:27.147 --> 02:30.014
They strap you to instructors.
I don't like it.

- OK.
- Mm.

02:34.237 --> 02:39.106
Mm, hang off a 500ft cliff
by ropes and those metal keychains?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.075
OK. They're called carabineers,
first of all. You know that.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.032
When did we become adrenaline junkies?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.746
Filling the void.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.243
There we go.

No, it's not.

You're alive.

The virus is still out there.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.746
The Twelve Monkeys
got their hands on it somehow.

04:06.872 --> 04:10.535
We destroyed M Five Ten in Chechnya,
we burned it, all of it.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.204
The CIA has satellite photos
that prove that.

04:13.336 --> 04:17.124
The Night Room is destroyed,
the remains, the origin is gone.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.872
- Leland is dead.
- We missed something.

04:19.009 --> 04:23.469
We? No, you. You missed something.
How is this still happening?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.462
Because it was neverjust Leland.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.390
There's Oliver Peters. He was
at the CIA during Operation Troy.

04:31.521 --> 04:35.139
- He gave them the virus.
- We need to find him.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.267
Langley barely let us off the hook
last time, we can't open that again.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.735
- Aaron, we have to.
- Why?

04:40.864 --> 04:42.946
Look, I know this is
hard for you to understand.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.907
No, I get it. The world is ending.

You're a time traveler.
Who doesn't know what he's doing.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.404
- Back off.
- You got her killed.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.576
And then I got her back.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.370
How many times
will you be able to do that?

04:54.503 --> 04:57.245
How many times does she have to die
before you figure your shit out?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.041
- Cole.
- You don't know, do you?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.756
- Stop it!
- You're right about one thing.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.968
The future's pretty bleak
if you're all they've got.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.964
The fact that he's here? Again.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.795
I don't know.

05:44.928 --> 05:49.092
At least before,
I had hope that we could beat this.

Yeah. Well, nothing stays the same.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.296

07:08.428 --> 07:12.922
He uses them to mask the smell of death.
It's an old plague trick.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.474
That's not Peters.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.478
It's his husband. Peters is gone.

They must have gotten to him first.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.068
And his hard drive.

They're connected to this place somehow.

it all started. We found it.

18:59.055 --> 19:03.139
- Not follow him blindly.
- I'm not following him blindly.

19:03.267 --> 19:07.977
Cass, after everything that's happened
to you. Kidnapped. Killed. Unkilled.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.357
- That's not gonna happen again.
- It is.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.815
It's gonna happen over and over again.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.855
Listen to me.

19:15.988 --> 19:21.608
If Cole is right...
You and I don't have a future.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.578
- Cass...
- I can do this alone but don't want to.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.714
Please don't make me.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.000
(SIGHS)

19:49.605 --> 19:51.846
He's ready.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.643
(SIGHS)

19:57.279 --> 19:59.270
Alright. Let's get this over with.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.752
Brave.
Don't make 'em like you any more.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.589
Most stay away, whispers.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.799
Some come for my herb.
Gives you pictures you know.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.678
Pictures in your head you can't erase.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.477
They don't work
unless the leaves are red

20:31.605 --> 20:34.688
and they're not red
unless he's been there.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.433
Why don't you tell me about
the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.437
Monkeys?! (SIGHS)

20:40.573 --> 20:43.781
No. No monkeys here.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.491
Who are you?

20:47.913 --> 20:52.031
We're the Daughters. Of mothers.
And midnight.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.626
And fathers.

20:55.755 --> 21:00.624
It's all out of order,
but there's still time, for you and me.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.672
- We have work to finish.
- What are you talking about?

21:03.804 --> 21:07.843
- What work?
- All kinds. Undo what I've done.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.840
You've done. What Cole's done.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.387
You know Cole?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.887
Cole, Cole...

21:15.608 --> 21:20.523
Eyes that see. Poor otter eyes.
Can't stop the plague.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.650
No. Can't undo that.

21:24.408 --> 21:29.277
- You know who started it?
- Yes.

21:29.413 --> 21:33.122
No.
There's only one who truly knows.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.788
Sees. Did see. Will see. (SIGHS)

21:37.797 --> 21:40.209
- The Witness.
- How do I find him?

21:40.341 --> 21:43.208
Tell me where Cole is
and I'll give you what you need.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.336
Cole's gone. I don't know where.

21:47.348 --> 21:51.091
How do you know what I need?

21:54.688 --> 22:00.058
Take it. It's yours.
You're gonna need it later.

22:03.531 --> 22:08.651
You're a good friend.
Not yet. But you will be.

22:12.915 --> 22:16.703
Wait.
There's something you need to know.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.872
WHITLEY: Get out. Open up.

22:20.214 --> 22:21.670
OLD JENNIFER: Today...

22:23.133 --> 22:28.673
...something happens
that will change things for you.

22:29.974 --> 22:34.013
Where's Ramse's bag?
Where does he keep his stuff?

22:34.144 --> 22:38.763
Not everything is preordained.
No matter how it may seem.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.766
- Hey, you can't be here.
- Shit.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.563
These people have done nothing.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.991
They say things happen for a reason.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.785
(SIGHS) That is a lie.

23:15.519 --> 23:21.185
Death can be both cause and effect.

23:21.317 --> 23:25.856
That's how it works. No straight lines.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.438
You ready?

23:32.870 --> 23:35.031
It's time to go.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.876
I know what happened to your mom.

24:25.965 --> 24:30.299
It's not fair. It's not right.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.805
It's what it is.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.719
You're not alone. You always got me.

24:40.854 --> 24:46.520
Always gonna protect you. Always.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.195
I gotta do something

24:52.324 --> 24:55.191
and I gotta go away for a little bit.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.196
OK?

24:58.706 --> 25:04.417
But I promise you I'm gonna come back.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.202
Promise.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.224
Take care.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.191
It was an accident. I made it right!

25:37.327 --> 25:39.659
Really? Is she alive again?

25:39.788 --> 25:42.575
Those injections
are essential for this mission!

25:42.708 --> 25:46.792
They may be essential.
But I'm not going after Ramse.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.538
With whatever time is left,
he should be a father to that boy.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.470
You know you're right about one thing.

26:02.186 --> 26:07.271
Someone, someday,

26:07.399 --> 26:10.061
will judge us for what we've done.

26:19.703 --> 26:24.242
Alright. So the trail of 25 Pagai Island
Macaques that I tracked from Sumatra

26:24.374 --> 26:26.956
to Guam to Panama goes cold right here.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.084
And that matters why?

26:29.213 --> 26:33.047
Because these particular monkeys
are perfect for viral cloning,

26:33.175 --> 26:36.417
and it's the only shipment of its kind
for the last two months.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.378
Could be a coincidence, but I doubt it.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.975
We're looking for one of these numbers.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.312
Ready?

27:05.332 --> 27:08.449
OK. You check out
that row of containers.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.962
I'll start on that side
and we'll meet in the middle.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.295
OK. Hey, be careful.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.419
MAN: Hello?

28:00.929 --> 28:05.423
Yes. I can hear you. Dr Peters?

28:05.559 --> 28:08.016
- PETERS: Who is it?
- It's Cassandra Railly.

28:08.145 --> 28:09.760
PETERS: Please, help me.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.541
(SIGHS)

28:57.194 --> 28:59.526
The virus. Where is it?

29:00.572 --> 29:04.781
(LAUGHS) It's done.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.448
It's gone. It's... it's...
it's completed.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.616
How?

29:10.749 --> 29:15.243
It wasn't hard.
A simple matter of reconstituting

29:15.379 --> 29:17.370
from the DNA I sequenced at Markridge.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.297
Why would you do this?

29:20.425 --> 29:26.386
For Jason. They said if I didn't
finish the job that they would...

29:30.102 --> 29:33.890
- Where are they taking the virus?
- I don't know.

29:34.022 --> 29:37.185
I don't know. They wouldn't say.
They just kept...

29:37.317 --> 29:40.480
He kept talking about the...
the Messengers. The Twelve.

29:40.612 --> 29:45.231
- Part of their plan.
- The Twelve. Who are they, Oliver?

29:45.367 --> 29:46.823
Tell me.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.739
Jason's dead, isn't he?

29:53.875 --> 29:55.706
Jason's...

29:59.840 --> 30:02.547
What I know.

30:02.676 --> 30:08.046
Even if you stopped them,
I could just make it again.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.882
I'm too dangerous alive.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.640
Please.

30:21.945 --> 30:27.030
Please. (SNIFFS)

30:53.310 --> 30:55.676
You need to get out of here.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.229
Stay off main roads.
Do not try to leave the country.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.231
Find a hole and disappear into it.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.198
WOMAN: Aaron Marker.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.662
AARON: Who are you?

31:15.791 --> 31:17.281
We haven't met.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.624
You're one of them.

31:19.753 --> 31:25.589
I want you to listen to me. And consider
everything I'm about to tell you.

31:25.717 --> 31:30.586
Doctor Railly is very important.
To us. And to you.

31:32.057 --> 31:37.097
So, tell me. What are you willing to do
to keep her alive?

31:59.793 --> 32:02.876
(SIGHS) Just couldn't keep away.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.819
Leave the case and go.

32:34.411 --> 32:38.074
Can't do that. I need to speak to Jones.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.781
What for?

32:43.044 --> 32:46.787
Assurance.
That she'll leave me and my son alone.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.840
You got what you want.
Let me talk to her.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.473
Hands behind your head.

33:14.117 --> 33:17.860
Look, what happened to Elena...

33:20.832 --> 33:22.413
I'm sorry, Ramse.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.926
(GRUNTS)

33:38.058 --> 33:43.018
They told me... (SIGHS)
what you did to the guy who shot Elena.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.102
I know it wasn't your fault.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.689
(GRUNTS)

34:03.041 --> 34:05.032
Whitley? Whitley, come in.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.918
SOLDIER: Move, move, move!

34:11.550 --> 34:14.838
JONES: Adler, we have to revive him.
I'm going to start the splinter process.

34:14.970 --> 34:17.461
We have to send him back to 1987 now.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.972
Do not let him get involved.

34:26.273 --> 34:30.858
(GRUNTS) Max.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.271
- What's going on?
- You're gonna be OK.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.149
Mr Cole, the effects
have not worn off yet.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.946
Cole, I will go check it out.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.029
Bring the core to full power.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.998
We'll have to augment every conduit
for a jump this far.

34:47.127 --> 34:50.460
Input coordinates. Double check.
There is no margin for error here.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.251
I want all the exits sealed.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.333
(GUNSHOTS)

35:00.640 --> 35:03.598
Get away from the control! Now!

35:07.814 --> 35:11.432
You thought you had everybody fooled,
huh?

35:12.861 --> 35:14.522
Huh?

35:30.378 --> 35:34.621
This is all over. It ends today.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.967
Ramse. It's me.

35:47.103 --> 35:50.095
Leave! Now!

35:50.231 --> 35:52.643
I can't do that.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.982
What do you mean you can't?

35:55.111 --> 35:59.024
Ramse, I want the same thing you do.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.772
A better life. OK?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.740
For all of us.

36:04.371 --> 36:09.536
She took Elena from me.
I'm not gonna let you take my son.

36:14.756 --> 36:18.999
She succeeds in this mission,
he's gone.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.168
Maybe he'll have a better future.

36:23.306 --> 36:28.892
I'm his father. Maybe not good enough.

36:29.979 --> 36:34.097
Tell me, Mr Ramse.
The love that you feel for your son.

36:34.234 --> 36:38.443
Can you imagine that a thousand fold?
A billion?

36:38.571 --> 36:45.443
Just think of the loss across the world
that hit parent after parent.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.619
Hannah.

36:53.294 --> 36:59.210
That's your little girl.
The plague took her from you.

36:59.342 --> 37:04.006
That's what this is for you.
The plague happened.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.973
My son is the future.

37:09.394 --> 37:13.057
Your daughter is the past.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.476
Do it.

37:19.028 --> 37:19.938
Do it.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.698
Ramse. Don't!

37:36.880 --> 37:37.915
Mr Cole.

37:49.476 --> 37:53.219
Shit! Shit!

37:56.024 --> 37:58.265
(PANTS)

38:02.238 --> 38:04.729
JONES: The soldiers will be here soon.

38:06.075 --> 38:10.865
There's nowhere to go.
Give up, Mr Ramse.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.796
I promised my son
I'd always protect him.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.421
I can't do it now...

38:31.226 --> 38:33.842
...I'II do it then.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.576
Max...

38:55.166 --> 38:59.785
Ramse... don't let him go.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.168
Hey. Hey.

39:19.148 --> 39:23.107
You? You wanna live?

39:25.822 --> 39:27.733
Send me back.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.158
JONES: No! Don't!

39:36.165 --> 39:37.200
Ramse!

39:44.382 --> 39:45.997
(YELLS)

40:08.865 --> 40:11.652
You really think Peters will be able
to outrun the Twelve Monkeys?

40:11.784 --> 40:14.491
He's a genius. He'll figure it out.

40:14.621 --> 40:17.533
Maybe you should have left
the gun with him. Let him do it.

40:21.669 --> 40:28.131
- I think that's enough.
- OK. But he's not innocent.

40:28.259 --> 40:33.049
He thought he was saving his husband.
But he still made a choice.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.138
I get it.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.347
You do?

40:39.479 --> 40:43.267
Helping to destroy the world
to save just one person?

40:43.900 --> 40:50.021
One person that you love.
In the end, isn't that all that matters?

40:50.156 --> 40:51.191
No.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.173
Where is he?

41:11.302 --> 41:14.214
Yourjump to 1987
was pre-programmed,

41:14.347 --> 41:18.556
but with the serum
so freshly administered,

41:18.685 --> 41:22.724
it's very difficult to say
where he might have landed.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.934
Why can't you just bring him back?

41:26.067 --> 41:28.729
He was never synchronized.
We have no tracer signal.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.446
His trip was one-way.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.860
- (SIGHS)
- You alright?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.200
Yeah.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.445
This treatment was a temporary
solution for your condition.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.788
ltjust gives us one morejump.

41:42.917 --> 41:48.002
James. We are out of time.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.631
1987 is the end game.

41:52.760 --> 41:59.302
You must find the source of the plague
and you must eliminate it.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.893
James.

42:12.030 --> 42:16.945
Mr Ramse survives the jump,
he's gonna try and stop you.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.026
And when he does I'm gonna kill him.
