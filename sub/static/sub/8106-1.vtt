00:14.223 --> 00:16.015
Mark? Mark?

00:16.141 --> 00:18.726
Mark, please ask your father
if he wants a burger.

00:18.852 --> 00:19.686
Mom.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.020
I know. You're defending the free world.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.022
Please ask your Dad
if he wants a burger.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.274
Dad?

00:25.984 --> 00:29.404
Dad? Mom wants to know
if you want a burger.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.744
Mom, I don't know what
he wants. You ask him.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.955
Aunt Arlene!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.293
Want a burger?

00:46.505 --> 00:48.381
Okay.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.795
The guy drove his wheelchair
into a pool. House would love that.

02:50.921 --> 02:54.423
He'll be bored. It's a great visual,
but it's diagnostically boring.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.260
What about post-hair-transplant
aphasia guy?

02:57.386 --> 03:00.137
Infection-throwing clots. House will
shoot it down and call you an idiot.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.806
Oh, well,
we wouldn't want that.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.307
What about yoga girl?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.475
It has a good hook.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.810
Should we lead with it?

03:06.353 --> 03:10.189
His first day back, he might
want to flex his sarcasm muscle.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.149
Maybe we open with
one of the weaker pitches.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.572
You ran here?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.741
It's just eight miles.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.909
Why did you...

03:22.035 --> 03:24.620
Why does a dog lick its
workplace-acceptable euphemism

03:24.746 --> 03:27.415
- for testicles?
- Because he can.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.416
What have you got for me, boss?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.085
I thought you said you needed
eight weeks of rehab.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.170
- You should have been back here...
- If I'd come back sooner,

03:33.297 --> 03:36.757
then I'd only be able to run six miles.
I never would have made it in.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.176
- What have you got for me?
- You're completely pain-free?

03:39.303 --> 03:40.595
The ketamine treatment
can wear off.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.763
It's been two months.
It's not wearing off.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.807
- What have you got for me?
- You can take as long as...

03:44.933 --> 03:47.977
Why are we having this discussion?
Want to hear me thank you again?

03:48.103 --> 03:50.438
Thank you, Doctor Cuddy,
not just for removing the bullet,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.273
but thank you for putting me
into a ketamine-induced coma

03:52.399 --> 03:55.026
and changing my life.
Happy? I am.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.987
Middle-aged man had hair transplant
about two months ago...

03:58.113 --> 04:01.198
Infection-throwing clots.
You're an idiot.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.744
Except you're not an idiot,

04:06.079 --> 04:09.123
and she is holding a file
for a 26-year-old female.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.375
What have you
really got for me?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.337
Girl was doing an inverted yoga pose,
neck snapped,

04:14.463 --> 04:15.922
paralyzed from the neck down,

04:16.048 --> 04:20.259
except the x-rays show
no evidence of spinal injury.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.261
And she's cute.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.263
Oh, well played, sir.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.854
What about Stephen Hawking
trying to do the 500 butterfly?

04:31.980 --> 04:36.317
Forget it. Brain cancer, brain surgery.
There's nothing left to diagnose.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.778
I would take the other one.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.238
I'll take them both.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.829
You don't think
he had brain cancer?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.498
Of course he had brain cancer.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.708
Even oncologists
don't screw up for eight years.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.045
So if there's no diagnostic issue,
why are you taking the case?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.297
- Treatment can be interesting.
- Not to you.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.548
- I've changed.
- No, you haven't.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.093
- No, I haven't.
- So why are you taking the case?

05:02.219 --> 05:03.469
The guy tried to kill himself.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.804
The guy had cancer.
He's a lump.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.974
He hasn't been able
to touch his wife, speak to his kids.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.977
He's been in that chair for eight years.
His muscles have atrophied.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.895
Maybe I can help him
with the pain.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.355
Isn't that enough of a reason
to want to help?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.440
- Not for you.
- I've changed.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.817
No, you haven't.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.236
Then why am I
taking this case?

05:27.244 --> 05:30.037
- Let's start with the cute paraplegic.
- Welcome back.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.580
- Hey.
- You look...

05:31.707 --> 05:32.540
Healthy.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.716
Quad with no broken neck.
Struck me as odd.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.512
You can take a whole two minutes
to ease into being back.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.264
I would've taken
a whole month to ease back,

05:48.390 --> 05:50.099
but eight weeks is
the maximum rehab time

05:50.225 --> 05:52.977
for a gunshot wound
to the stomach and neck, so go.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.396
We heard they never found the guy.
There's no new leads.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.481
What? You think he might have
shot this patient, too?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.817
- It would explain her symptoms.
- It could be MS.

05:59.943 --> 06:03.029
See? It's not so difficult.
It's not MS.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.781
She had no symptoms before she
climbed onto her head.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.993
Unless she's been upside-down
for the last 10 years, MS ain't it.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.953
Could be transverse myelitis,
swelling in the disks,

06:11.079 --> 06:14.206
- choking off nerve function.
- MRI is negative for that.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.756
Your leg looks fine.
Totally pain-free?

06:21.882 --> 06:25.217
When did this turn into, "What did
you do over your summer vacation?"

06:25.343 --> 06:27.511
It's a little weird to
discuss the case

06:27.637 --> 06:29.513
while you're staring
at your blood on the floor.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.058
I asked Cuddy to
replace the carpet.

06:33.685 --> 06:38.272
I like the carpet.
What did you do over the summer?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.607
- I...
- Redo the tests.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.819
Let's see if the source of the problem
is in the limbs or the spine. Do an EMG.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:47.491 --> 06:51.786
We've got a whole other quad to cover.
This guy's still got fluid in his lungs.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.329
You don't think
that's from the pool he drank?

06:53.455 --> 06:56.499
Give him an O2 mask.
His leg muscles have atrophied.

06:56.625 --> 07:00.127
Tendons have shortened from disuse,
causing intense pain.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.339
Tendon surgery will make him
more comfortable.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.049
Comfortable?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.552
Scoot.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.017
Thanks for being here.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.603
Not a problem.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.279
My Dad wouldn't kill himself.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.406
You haven't spoken to him
in over six years.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.034
- I know my dad.
- Mark, the doctor's just trying to...

07:32.160 --> 07:35.246
- He wouldn't kill himself.
- Fine. I'm wrong.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.290
You obviously have
a better understanding of this man

07:38.416 --> 07:41.085
who drools in front of your
TV set 24 hours a day.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.628
Doctor House?

07:42.754 --> 07:46.132
Look, he must have been confused, all
right? It must have been an accident.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.676
I hope it was
a suicide attempt.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.847
If he was trying to kill himself,
then he knows how miserable his life is.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.016
It means there's still
something there to kill.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.145
It means your dad's
still there.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.025
Sorry. Need you.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.528
Thank you.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.661
We were doing the EMG,
but we never got past the insertion

08:15.787 --> 08:18.998
of the conduction pin.
Did she just say, "Thank you"?

08:19.124 --> 08:21.333
I loaned her some money.
What went wrong?

08:21.459 --> 08:22.626
Nothing went wrong.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.628
If nothing went wrong,
then something went right.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.172
You're not gonna tell me
why she thanked you?

08:26.298 --> 08:28.507
You're not gonna tell me
what went right?

08:28.633 --> 08:33.470
You did something for which
she is grateful, and you're embarrassed?

08:33.597 --> 08:36.891
For you. She saw you coming up,
thought you were a 14 year-old boy.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.142
I set her straight.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.061
I am not telling you
what went wrong or right

08:41.188 --> 08:43.606
until you tell me why
she said, "Thank you."

08:43.732 --> 08:48.819
Oh, you got me. You know I need
to know. I am so gonna fold.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.156
Except you're forgetting
there's one thing I can do now.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.245
It's either that
or a reflex response.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.830
What happened?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.081
Okay.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.125
This is Doctor House.
House, this is Caren...

09:03.251 --> 09:04.627
Pleasure's all mine.
What happened?

09:04.753 --> 09:07.463
When we inserted the conduction pin,
she flinched.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.590
She flinched? Did you hear?

09:09.716 --> 09:10.883
Does that mean
I'm getting better?

09:11.009 --> 09:14.845
How big is a flinch? Bigger than
a twitch? Smaller than a spasm?

09:17.682 --> 09:19.725
- Do you smoke?
- Socially, not a lot.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.435
You do yoga, and you smoke?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.937
I know it's hypocritical,
but...

09:23.063 --> 09:27.733
No, the world sees your legs.
No one's checking out your lungs.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.109
How would smoking cause...

09:29.236 --> 09:31.278
It wouldn't.
I just needed a lighter.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.991
- House.
- Oh, my God!

09:37.285 --> 09:39.995
- The case was looking so promising.
- Hey, I'm not faking.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.373
You moved,
therefore you can move.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.003
Get this lunatic out of here
before she bores again.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.421
I'm not faking!

10:11.945 --> 10:16.782
I heard you were watching surgery
with a patient's family,

10:17.367 --> 10:19.910
talking to a patient's family.

10:21.913 --> 10:25.666
It's because of your hallucination,
isn't it? After you were shot.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.918
You chose life.
You decided you wanted meaning,

10:28.044 --> 10:32.965
so you took a case with no mystery,
something any doctor could do,

10:33.091 --> 10:37.094
a case with no upside
except the satisfaction

10:37.220 --> 10:39.054
of helping
another human being.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.599
She thanked me.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.269
And you felt nothing.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.440
I wasn't sure what
I was supposed to feel.

10:51.526 --> 10:56.739
It's like your leg. It's atrophied.
Keep working it. The feeling will come.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.824
Sorry. Need you again.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.117
I told you to get rid of her.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.869
It's a good thing we didn't.
Tightness in her chest.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.746
She can't breathe.
It could be pleural effusion.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.791
Right. Either that or she's holding
her breath like a four-year-old.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.055
Relax. I'm not gonna
burn you again.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.641
I'm going to stab you!

11:31.608 --> 11:35.110
Look, either you're faking,
or you've got a pleural effusion.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.571
That's a buildup of fluid
around the lungs, which is very serious,

11:37.697 --> 11:40.199
and I would have no choice but to
stab you in the back with this needle

11:40.325 --> 11:41.950
and suck all of the fluid
out of you.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.787
So...

11:44.913 --> 11:46.705
We should give her a local.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.832
That would defeat
the point of me being nasty.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.960
Ready?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.012
- Down.
- She can't breathe if she's down.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.138
- Down.
- She can't...

12:03.264 --> 12:05.516
Down, down, down! Come on!

12:14.567 --> 12:16.193
That's not a pleural effusion.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.736
The problem's in her heart.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.156
Can't fake that.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.046
Had to relieve the pressure
three times in the last two hours,

12:36.172 --> 12:39.425
so either we figure out what's causing
blood to build up around her heart,

12:39.551 --> 12:41.718
or I follow her around
with a needle for the rest of her life.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.887
Echo was clean.
No structural abnormalities.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.223
It could be
an infectious process, TB.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.058
Or vasculitis would also
explain the effusion.

12:48.184 --> 12:53.063
But not the paralysis.
Let's assume that she wasn't faking it.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.692
She moved, therefore she could move.
She wasn't paralyzed.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.695
Doesn't mean she was faking.
It could have been a delusion.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.196
Now, either she was faking

13:01.322 --> 13:03.532
and coincidentally
got a real cardiac problem

13:03.658 --> 13:05.826
at the exact same time,
or it's a delusion,

13:05.952 --> 13:09.079
and the fake paralysis is
a real neurological symptom.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.206
Are you thinking
vascular tumor on her spine?

13:11.332 --> 13:12.499
Her platelets are normal.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.585
And she's been scanned up
and down. It's all clean.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.795
So open her up and find it.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.548
So what do you want us to do?
Just start at her neck

13:19.674 --> 13:22.718
and just keep on cutting down her spine
until we stumble on something?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.178
That should work.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.979
- His heart rate's a little high.
- Should I be worried?

13:34.105 --> 13:36.899
Probably just means he's still
in discomfort from the surgery.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.526
I'm gonna up his
morphine a little.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.111
You've been so nice to us.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.197
It's the job.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.075
No, I mean, all the other doctors,
all they did was obsess on the cancer,

13:47.202 --> 13:51.288
the treatment, the damage,
just trying to fix him.

13:52.123 --> 13:56.376
You're the first doctor that's given
a damn about the quality of his life.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.591
His heart rate's come down.
The morphine worked. I was right.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.808
What a touching moment.
That's why we become doctors,

14:11.935 --> 14:14.353
for these rare moments
when our hearts are warmed...

14:14.479 --> 14:16.813
Would you like to get a drink?

14:17.023 --> 14:19.608
Are you serious, or are you just trying
to change the subject?

14:19.734 --> 14:21.485
No, I'm serious.

14:21.611 --> 14:26.907
I drink. You drink. We could do it
at the same time, the same table.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.619
If you eat,
we could do that, too.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.791
I mean, if the answer's no,
that's cool, but...

14:38.378 --> 14:43.924
No, it's just you're just coming off of
surgery, and you're not yourself yet,

14:44.050 --> 14:47.678
and I work for you,
and even though last year's...

14:48.972 --> 14:51.848
You're smiling.
I'm saying no, and you're smiling.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.811
Well, don't take it personally.
It's just 'cause you're full of crap.

14:55.937 --> 15:00.107
You have no interest in going out with
me. Maybe you did, when I couldn't walk,

15:00.233 --> 15:03.527
when I was a sick puppy
that you could nurture back to health.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.655
Now that I'm healthy,
there's nothing in it for you.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.908
You are not healthy.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.288
Cuddy wants to see you.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.298
You've been back at work
24 hours,

15:24.424 --> 15:27.926
and you're already playing
hide-and-seek in a woman's spine.

15:28.052 --> 15:28.969
Who won the pool?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.470
There's no tumor.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.472
Her platelets are normal.
The scans didn't...

15:32.599 --> 15:37.060
What's the worst that can happen? Might
paralyze her. She won't even notice.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.771
Her lawyers might.
You're not doing the surgery.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.732
And lower the morphine
on your other patient.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.776
Fine, I'll lower it
if you let me do the surgery.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.738
What? You want to trade?

15:48.281 --> 15:51.992
We're not swapping a couple of goats
for your help putting up a barn.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.244
You want something.
I want something. We compromise.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.954
It's the grownup way
to resolve our differences.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.331
There already is
a mechanism for that,

15:57.457 --> 15:59.625
it's called
the employer-employee relationship,

15:59.751 --> 16:02.044
I get what I want,
and you don't.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.728
You tried to swap?

16:19.854 --> 16:23.523
Ran a few more tests. They came back
negative. The surgery's on.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.285
You really don't give a crap,
do you?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.329
Does that make me evil?

16:37.455 --> 16:38.789
Yeah.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.625
The girl's life is at stake. All
we're talking about with the guy is...

16:41.751 --> 16:45.420
All we're talking about is the reason
you took the case, to help someone.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.214
- Too bad for them.
- Too bad for you.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.635
The reason we crave meaning
is because it makes us happy.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.013
The first level
of happiness...

16:55.556 --> 16:57.140
I'm not going away.

16:57.266 --> 17:01.603
The fifth level of happiness
involves creation, changing lives.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.357
The sixth level is heroin.
The seventh level is you going away.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.985
You're saving lives,
which is tantamount to creating lives,

17:09.112 --> 17:12.072
but all you're taking away
from this is the game.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.407
You don't have to listen
to them thanking you.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.410
You don't have to change the cases
you take or even how you handle them.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.038
You just have to know
that you made a difference.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.717
- House! You're not...
- I'm not an idiot.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.843
Move.

17:32.969 --> 17:33.927
House, leave her alone.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.595
Close her up.
You want to know why?

17:35.722 --> 17:36.888
The room's no longer sterile.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.350
True, but it's not
the most interesting reason.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.019
That is not a sexy big toe.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.563
You'd never put that
in your mouth.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.522
What the hell does
that got to do...

17:45.648 --> 17:49.317
I told you it was interesting,
but it gets even better.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.156
Scurvy?

17:54.282 --> 17:55.657
Yeah. Drink.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.243
Like what sailors get
when they don't eat right?

17:58.369 --> 18:01.955
Aye, aye. Your arms and leg tissues
are choked with blood.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.584
It makes it hard to move.
It also damages your hair and toenails.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.170
But I'm on this great diet,
lots of protein, lots of...

18:08.296 --> 18:11.631
No vitamin C. Now drink.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.678
Well, thank you.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.182
And thank Doctor House.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.933
You can send him a note.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.939
The nurse changed his morphine.
I thought you were worried about...

18:28.357 --> 18:32.861
It's just post-op discomfort.
He's ready to go home.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.946
So he won't have any pain?

18:35.072 --> 18:36.823
Eventually.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.409
Thank you.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.578
Everything else
will be the same.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.582
Well, you took away his pain,
and that changes a lot.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.256
Why don't you put him
in some sort of facility,

18:54.634 --> 18:56.885
some place without a pool?

18:59.222 --> 19:02.098
Yeah, I could dump him there,

19:02.225 --> 19:05.685
except he's my husband.

19:06.354 --> 19:07.687
He's my son's father.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.774
Right. Kids need a dad,

19:10.900 --> 19:13.401
someone to play catch with,
talk about girls.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.862
You know, Mark's learning
that you don't have to abandon someone

19:15.988 --> 19:18.031
- just because...
- Get a dog.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.703
I'm taking care of him
for the same reason you helped us.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.040
Because some guy shot you,
and you hallucinated?

19:27.333 --> 19:28.875
I have a responsibility.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.878
So he's just an anchor,
weighing you and your family down,

19:32.004 --> 19:35.674
sapping your energy, wasting your life?
That's the meaning you take from this?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.259
I want to take care of him.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.969
You enjoy this?

19:39.095 --> 19:40.637
I can't abandon him.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.851
So you don't want to
take care of him?

19:46.143 --> 19:49.646
Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you,
make you happy,

19:50.815 --> 19:54.401
but not taking care of him
would make you miserable?

19:57.488 --> 19:58.488
Hmm.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.456
Okay, here we go.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.712
Okay, slowly.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.676
I don't need your help.
I've done this a million times.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.012
Here, lie him like that.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.769
Do that again.
Make that sound.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.536
What was that?

20:46.662 --> 20:49.956
That was talking.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.924
You guys are lousy doctors.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.176
You were in such a rush
to make the patient feel better,

21:01.302 --> 21:03.261
you forgot to check
what was wrong.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.722
Yoga girl walked out of here
two hours ago. You fixed her.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.224
- Not her. The other guy.
- He had brain cancer.

21:08.351 --> 21:12.020
They removed it eight years ago. His
condition's been the same ever since.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.022
Until last night. He spoke.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.483
What'd he say?

21:19.862 --> 21:20.946
He grunted?

21:21.072 --> 21:22.822
You want us to
dissect eight years

21:22.949 --> 21:25.367
of medical history with grunting
in the differential?

21:25.493 --> 21:28.703
Sounds good.
Call me when you're done.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.502
You're fabricating a mystery
because you're bored.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.629
I am not bored.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.174
Damn it!

21:41.300 --> 21:43.385
You didn't tell the wife
it was only a grunt?

21:43.511 --> 21:44.719
Of course not.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.847
'Cause then she would never have
consented to a bunch of dangerous tests.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.766
I don't remember
you being this bitchy.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.811
The Vicodin dulled it. In the sober
light of day, I'm a buzz-kill.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.563
You're giving false hope
to a family that's been wrecked.

21:55.690 --> 21:58.400
Don't torture them. Let it go.
Tell the wife it was only a grunt.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.359
Tell her to go home.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.319
I can't let her down
like that.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.239
I pumped her up
with too much false hope.

22:07.952 --> 22:12.831
I stuck that primo!
How rad am I?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.231
2002, patient had dry eyes.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.358
Dry eyes plus a grunt.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.611
- It all makes sense.
- Could be a neurological issue.

22:43.738 --> 22:46.531
I get hay fever, I put drops in my eyes.
I don't go to a neurologist.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.534
Dry eyes could indicate
an autonomic dysfunction.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.493
It goes on the board.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.203
What about coughing
or boogers?

22:52.329 --> 22:53.246
Should we include boogers?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.914
I'm happy we're doing this.

22:55.041 --> 22:58.168
I'd much rather do this
than lengthen some guy's tendon.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.504
Patient's headaches increased.
Doc scanned his head, found a tumor.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.715
- You like wasting your time?
- I'm learning.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.801
To do what?
Reconsider solved cases

23:06.927 --> 23:08.678
because you don't wanna deal
with the real world?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.096
He's pushing
where there's nothing.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.348
Cameron,
you are an excellent doctor.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.934
You'll get lots of tearful thank-yous
from grateful patients.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.062
Yeah, aren't I
such a bitch for wanting that?

23:17.188 --> 23:19.814
No, it's not a bad thing,
but it's not why I'm here.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.649
I took this fellowship
to learn from House.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.319
He's teaching you
to be a masochist.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.530
Dry eyes goes on the board.

23:30.076 --> 23:33.161
In eight years,
the patient experienced 214 symptoms,

23:33.287 --> 23:34.662
many of them repeated.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.830
Any patterns?

23:35.956 --> 23:39.959
Fever plus frequent urination
could mean prostatitis.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.836
Or a urinary-tract infection.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.047
White count was normal.
No infection.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.508
If you add pain
into the mix, fever,

23:46.634 --> 23:50.386
frequent urination
could indicate a kidney problem.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.805
I like it.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.390
No, creatinine and BUN
were both normal.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.392
Not the kidney part.
The pain part.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.854
Abdominal pain plus all that
stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.191
Perfect. You managed to pick
the one symptom he never had,

24:03.317 --> 24:04.192
abdominal pain.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.194
It's the first symptom
on the board, "grunt."

24:06.320 --> 24:08.488
Grunting isn't pathognomonic
for abdominal pain.

24:08.614 --> 24:12.826
No, the traditional diagnostic
marker is compression of the diaphragm,

24:12.952 --> 24:15.662
vibration of the larynx,
leading to the audible sound,

24:15.788 --> 24:17.247
"I have a pain in my abdomen."

24:17.373 --> 24:20.250
Richard's symptoms are culled
from eight years of medical history.

24:20.376 --> 24:24.003
They're not patterned. These are
random, individual events over time.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.966
Illnesses have incubation periods.
Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.342
His throat will collapse.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.970
Muscle degeneration in his neck
won't tolerate the scope.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.847
- It's an automatic trach.
- You're talking about him

24:33.973 --> 24:34.889
like he's an invalid.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.182
We were insensitive.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.978
Does he drool? Can he hold his neck
straight? Does he choke on his food?

24:42.606 --> 24:45.275
His neck's fine.
His throat's not gonna collapse.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.402
Cameron,
get consent from the wife.

24:50.281 --> 24:51.865
Open.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.124
I need you to swallow.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.303
Sorry about that.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.352
Here we go.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.114
We're passing through
the lower esophageal sphincter

25:33.240 --> 25:34.741
into the antrum
of the stomach.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.704
There's the tail
of the pancreas.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.039
Looks clean.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.375
Moving medially. The body
and the head of the pancreas look clean.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.544
Get it out. Get it out.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.297
It's stuck. I can't move it.
His throat's collapsed.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.885
His vitals are all over
the place. We're losing him.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.138
Cutting.

25:58.724 --> 26:02.477
We trached him, endoscopically removed
the probe, and he's breathing again,

26:02.603 --> 26:05.146
so, all in all, great idea.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.398
Get a look at the pancreas
before the world ended?

26:07.524 --> 26:08.358
It was clean.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.068
Which means,
barring anything else,

26:10.194 --> 26:12.153
meaning you,
he can go home tomorrow.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.280
This man nearly died.
How can you discharge him?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.574
His throat collapsed
because of what we predicted.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.618
You stick something
down someone's throat,

26:18.744 --> 26:23.081
they gag, spasm, which he did. It took
us a half an hour to get the thing out.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.250
Except our patient's throat
was sedated,

26:26.543 --> 26:29.879
which means the brain should have
sent a signal not to do anything.

26:30.965 --> 26:34.550
This could be cancer
or some bizarre neuro-degeneration,

26:34.677 --> 26:39.055
- even a new type of vascular...
- Stop it. You're enjoying this.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.266
I find it interesting.

26:41.392 --> 26:42.642
It's interesting
only if you're right.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.978
If you're wrong,
we're torturing this guy to amuse you.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.691
Half hour to remove the probe?

26:50.985 --> 26:52.360
House.

26:52.987 --> 26:53.903
It's not a spasm.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.782
His throat didn't collapse.
It locked down.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.535
The brain is supposed to tell every
muscle in the body to relax and contract

27:00.661 --> 27:03.037
at the same time.
This muscle was only contracting,

27:03.163 --> 27:05.081
which means the signal from the brain
was not getting through.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.042
There are no lesions on his brain,
nothing to interrupt any orders.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.502
All it takes is one wire down.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.004
You have no evidence
of any wires down.

27:11.130 --> 27:15.675
A few microtumors on the meninges,
and suddenly you're choking to death.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.094
You want to look at
the lining of his brain?

27:18.220 --> 27:21.347
The amount of contrast material
you need to pump up there just to see...

27:21.473 --> 27:23.933
- He'll bleed into his brain!
- No, he won't.

27:24.059 --> 27:28.813
Because that wouldn't be interesting.
You can get permission this time.

27:31.692 --> 27:34.861
The brain is enclosed
in a sack called the meninges.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.322
Does this mean
the cancer's back?

27:37.448 --> 27:39.574
- No. No, no, no.
- House.

27:44.121 --> 27:49.917
If we found cancer, it wouldn't be
the original cancer. It'd be new.

27:50.044 --> 27:53.421
So, what, more surgery,
more radiation.

27:53.547 --> 27:54.839
Might not be the worst thing.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.595
If this isn't just ancient history, then
maybe it's something we can correct.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.097
Might even get some
brain function back.

28:04.725 --> 28:05.975
He could get better?

28:06.101 --> 28:07.310
No.

28:14.610 --> 28:17.278
But understanding
what you're saying will be nice.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.739
Maybe you could figure out
ways to communicate.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.160
Thank God he spoke to you.

28:24.286 --> 28:30.249
Mrs. McNeil, the test to do
this is very risky. He could die.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.756
He's already dead.

28:50.104 --> 28:52.271
Chase, go slow.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.524
I've already injected it
into his spinal canal.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.819
Next stop, his brain.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.702
Contrast material
entering into the fourth ventricle.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.663
No parenchymal bleeds.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.374
Blood pressure's high,
but it's holding.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.710
Meninges are intact.
No bleeding.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.467
Oh, God. Foreman, get in here.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.069
Surgeon repaired the CSF leak.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.279
You're lucky he didn't die.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.573
I'm lucky?
He's the one who didn't die.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.032
We told you he'd hemorrhage.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.910
You told me he'd bleed
into his brain, not out of his ear.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.537
You've got to drop this.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.164
We're missing something.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.501
We did a dangerous test, and something
bad happened. That's all this is.

29:57.004 --> 30:01.215
Give me a tour of the brain, Foreman.
Walk me through the scans.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.302
1998, what happened?

30:04.428 --> 30:07.972
Five-centimeter, grade-four astrocytoma
between the parietal...

30:08.098 --> 30:12.185
Nothing. Next? The speck
on the superior temporal region.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.103
It's a re-growth, benign.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.147
The star thingy
next to the Rathke cleft?

30:16.273 --> 30:17.732
Scar tissue from a biopsy.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.650
House, every speck
is not a suspect.

30:19.776 --> 30:23.863
It's years of surgeons
digging around in his head. Let him go.

30:24.364 --> 30:28.201
Redo every blood test
he's ever had. Rescan his head.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.535
No.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.790
He's been suffering for eight years.
I'm not gonna help you make it worse.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.168
I'm not gonna help you
make it interesting.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.087
That's okay. Foreman's better
at that stuff than you are.

30:40.672 --> 30:44.550
We need five-millimeter cuts through
the occipital and hypothalamic regions.

30:45.469 --> 30:46.761
No.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.064
How many millimeters?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.276
I can help him.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.570
That's it?
That's your argument?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
It seems like a good one.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.200
If I thought for a second you wanted to
help him, you'd have carte blanche.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.327
You're doing this
because it's fun.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.079
Does nobody in this hospital

31:13.205 --> 31:15.081
have anything better
to talk about than my motives?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.624
My motives have nothing
to do with the case.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.043
Your motives have everything
to do with your judgment.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.379
For the first time in years,
I got no opiates in my body.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.547
Now you question my judgment?

31:22.673 --> 31:25.174
Twenty-four times a year,
you come storming into my office,

31:25.300 --> 31:28.761
spouting that you can help someone,
only you never say those words.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.429
You say something like,

31:30.556 --> 31:34.392
"His pancreas is gonna explode
because his brain is on fire."

31:34.518 --> 31:36.852
You come here with medicine,
not with platitudes.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.230
I didn't wanna bore you
with the details.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.857
There are no details.
You have a hunch.

31:42.776 --> 31:46.821
House, you don't use hunches.
You always have reasons.

31:47.447 --> 31:51.117
This hospital doesn't exist
for your whims. I'm sorry.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.162
As of 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,
I'm sending your patient home.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.672
The answer's no.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.883
Cuddy called 30 seconds after you left
and said you'd try an end-around.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.443
My leg hurt.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.113
How bad?

32:29.239 --> 32:31.073
Enough that I'm telling you.

32:31.950 --> 32:32.783
Did it go away?

32:34.536 --> 32:35.620
Ached for a while.

32:38.081 --> 32:41.000
First time I've felt anything
there since the surgery.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.252
But it went away?

32:45.380 --> 32:48.174
It was muscular.
There was some cramping.

32:50.344 --> 32:51.802
What are you smiling about?

32:54.264 --> 32:56.015
You're 40-something years old.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.975
You've been running God knows
how many miles a day,

32:58.101 --> 32:59.852
fallen a hundred times
off that skateboard,

32:59.978 --> 33:01.604
and you're shocked
to have some soreness?

33:01.730 --> 33:03.147
Just give me a prescription.

33:03.273 --> 33:04.482
For Vicodin?

33:04.608 --> 33:07.151
House, people get
aching joints, cramps.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.612
They put on an ice pack.
They take some ibuprofen.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.530
I know what the pangs
of middle age feel like.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.617
No, you don't
because you've been stuffing Vicodin

33:14.743 --> 33:16.369
every five minutes
since you turned middle-aged.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.995
The surgery didn't work.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.205
Don't play me.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.040
You think this is a scam?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.042
I think you want me
to feel sorry for you

33:23.168 --> 33:27.088
and either do the end-around on Cuddy
or give you the drugs.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.260
Either way, you get the high
you think you need.

33:37.224 --> 33:40.351
House, your surgery worked. You're fine.

33:40.477 --> 33:44.188
It's just gonna take time
for it to feel good.

35:15.989 --> 35:19.116
Circumventricular system
senses cytokines

35:19.242 --> 35:21.368
released in the early stages
of the immune response,

35:21.495 --> 35:23.412
but CVOS releases
prostaglandins

35:23.538 --> 35:25.790
that reset the hypothalamic
set point upward

35:25.916 --> 35:29.960
unless it's countered by antipyretic
therapy, so, yeah, his brain is on fire.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.297
The suicide attempt
was not a suicide attempt.

35:33.423 --> 35:34.965
He drove that wheelchair
into the pool

35:35.091 --> 35:37.384
because he couldn't regulate
his body temperature.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.386
He had a hypothalamic
dysregulation.

35:40.388 --> 35:45.893
And you discovered this when
you stepped into the university pool?

35:46.561 --> 35:49.188
Fountain. I can cure him.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.314
Cure him!

35:50.440 --> 35:52.358
Even if the fountain
proved anything,

35:52.484 --> 35:55.361
fixing hypothalamic dysregulation
isn't gonna regenerate brain.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.988
No, but if the scar tissue
on his hypothalamus

35:58.114 --> 35:59.532
is resting against
the pituitary,

35:59.658 --> 36:02.493
the adrenals would shut down.
Addison's disease.

36:02.619 --> 36:05.287
You didn't see any scar tissue
on his MRI, his CT scans...

36:05.413 --> 36:07.873
- His brain is functional.
- His temperature's normal.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.876
There is nothing wrong
with his hypothalamus or his pituitary!

36:11.002 --> 36:12.461
I can make him walk.
I can make him talk.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.046
This is a wild guess

36:14.172 --> 36:16.882
that came to you
because you were sweating.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.427
Inject him with cortisol. The guy
will have sex with his wife again.

36:20.554 --> 36:25.558
He'll hug his kid again. Hopefully,
that's the combination he was using.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.434
It'd be a shame
if I had cured a pedophile.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.980
You're smiling.
That's a bad sign.

36:31.940 --> 36:32.815
You're high.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.067
I told you,
I haven't had anything in three months.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.152
This is as high as you get,

36:37.279 --> 36:40.656
a theory that ties your case up
in a neat little bow,

36:40.782 --> 36:43.117
but you don't have
a lick of substantiating proof.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.956
Your decision doesn't make any sense.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.166
There is no risk
to a cortisol injection.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.210
If I'm wrong, big deal.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.713
He goes home a vegetable
like he already is, but if I'm right...

36:55.839 --> 36:58.883
This is not about downsides
or risk management.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.344
It is a big deal
for you to understand the word "No."

37:05.223 --> 37:07.099
I'm sorry, House.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.876
He's on his way out of here.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.587
I figured you'd be on your scooter,
racing down the halls

37:36.713 --> 37:38.839
to stab the patient
in the neck with cortisol.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.093
She was right to say no.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.306
I had no objective reason
to think that I was right.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.477
Just needed the puzzle.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.493
Hold on a sec.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.869
Is everything all right?

38:10.830 --> 38:14.291
Yeah, it's just
something I forgot.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.596
What's that?

38:27.722 --> 38:33.060
This is cortisol,
and it's to fight infection.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.524
Want to hold onto that?
Let's put a bandage on it.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.127
Is he okay?

39:03.174 --> 39:04.216
Yes.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.759
Can we go now?

39:05.885 --> 39:08.262
You can go.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.481
Excuse me.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.509
Richard. Richard.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.184
Dad, you okay?

40:04.778 --> 40:08.030
Richard? Richard! Richard!

40:09.282 --> 40:11.533
Richard!

40:12.952 --> 40:15.454
Richard.

40:22.253 --> 40:26.632
Richard, you're standing.

40:49.823 --> 40:52.116
Thank you.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.045
He got up.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.297
I have to go tell House.

41:07.423 --> 41:11.218
No. Cuddy, you can't tell him.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.470
I have to tell him.
He was right.

41:13.596 --> 41:16.598
Why did you do it?
Why did you think he might be right?

41:17.559 --> 41:18.934
Because he's House.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.186
Medically, what made you think
he was right?

41:22.480 --> 41:23.313
Nothing.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.191
He got lucky. That's all that happened.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.319
Telling him no
was a good thing

41:29.445 --> 41:32.906
because next time, he won't get lucky.
He'll kill someone.

41:34.033 --> 41:37.870
Just because he was right
doesn't mean he wasn't wrong.

41:44.836 --> 41:48.130
I see him every day.
I can't just...

41:48.882 --> 41:50.757
Everybody lies.
