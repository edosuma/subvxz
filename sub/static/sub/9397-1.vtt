00:22.120 --> 00:24.190
Nathan, I was hoping that was you.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.989
- I've been here alone all night.
- I had something to do.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.439
Oh, honey.

00:32.360 --> 00:36.956
I know this is hard for you,
but I promise you, we'll be free soon.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.353
I know we will.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.029
Hi.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.634
- What are you doing here?
- I want to come home, Nathan.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.556
Haley, this is really bad timing.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.191
Nathan, we have to go.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.039
- What's going on?
- It's urgent.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.270
It's your father. We have to go now.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.314
I'm sorry.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.994
Haley.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.518
Come with us.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.833
Looks like it's just you and me
this summer.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.515
- Peyton, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.954
- Come on, let's get you home.
- I can't be there alone.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.511
Will you stay with me?

02:22.960 --> 02:26.157
Peyton, you gotta talk to me.
What's going on with you?

02:28.680 --> 02:31.513
I've been getting
these creepy emails lately.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.353
Then, tonight this woman shows up

02:35.560 --> 02:37.790
and she knew things about me.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.112
What kind of things?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.991
She says she's my mother.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.798
My mom's dead, Luke.
I was there in the hospital.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.598
I watched her die.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.395
What?

03:03.960 --> 03:06.269
I did something tonight, Peyton.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.231
And I can't take it back.

03:36.240 --> 03:39.118
It's your father's car. He was working late.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.114
Mrs. Scott?

03:45.200 --> 03:48.192
- My husband was inside.
- They didn't tell you?

03:49.360 --> 03:52.750
Wait here. Captain, Mrs. Scott's here.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.037
Okay, putting aside the fact
that I do look pretty good

05:00.120 --> 05:02.680
considering I've been on a plane
for like a day and a half,

05:02.760 --> 05:04.637
you cannot ambush me at the airport

05:04.720 --> 05:07.632
with flowers and
a nicely tanned end-of-summer body

05:07.720 --> 05:10.154
considering the way we left things

05:12.000 --> 05:14.673
three months ago. Okay.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.951
Actually, I'm just here to pick up my mom
from New Zealand.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.156
I didn't think you were coming in
till tomorrow.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.674
You thought wrong.
Oh, look, there's my cab.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.196
Quick, maybe you can tell me
you love me or something.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.713
Hi, honey.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.437
Welcome home, Mom.
You haven't missed a thing.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.193
About time.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.071
Why, I knew you couldn't go an entire
summer without doing something here.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.630
- Whatever. You don't know me.
- Oh, I think I do.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.918
Okay, so, check it out, Tom Sawyer.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.999
If you're lucky, I might let you help me.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.231
And if you're really lucky,
I might even let you pay to help me.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.912
What do you say?

06:11.440 --> 06:12.919
Brooke's home.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.031
Went to the airport this morning
to pick up my mom,

06:15.120 --> 06:16.712
and poof, there was Brooke.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.631
- Poof?
- Poof.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.716
What are you gonna tell her?

06:27.880 --> 06:31.077
You're not doing this again.
You've turned Nathan's room inside out

06:31.160 --> 06:33.276
how many times
over the last three months?

06:33.360 --> 06:36.477
Those annulment papers
got to be here somewhere.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.592
Dan, you know what the doctor said.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.036
Getting agitated is just going to make
your burns itch.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.599
Isn't this really about the dealership?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.997
It's nearly rebuilt.
You'll be going to work soon.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.473
It might bring back some bad memories.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.719
I had a dream.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.238
I was at the office. Everything was normal.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.438
Then my arm was on fire.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.798
You still don't remember
how it happened?

07:19.120 --> 07:20.109
I was drinking,

07:23.200 --> 07:24.235
and passed out.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.679
Then I was on the outside,

07:30.360 --> 07:33.557
on the edge of an inferno.
Everything in between is black.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.070
I suppose some of our survival skills
are more than we know.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.796
- At least Nathan will be home soon.
- Which home, Deb?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.950
This one or with Haley?

07:57.760 --> 08:00.877
- Yo, big time! You got a letter, man.
- Letter? From who?

08:00.960 --> 08:03.758
I don't know, but whoever it is,
she smells hot.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.353
Gimme that.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.909
You better just hope she doesn't meet me.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.599
Hey. That was your mom on the phone.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.558
She said she's gonna spend the night
at the hospital with your dad.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.837
Unbelievable.
Should have a Scott family discount.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.270
I'm really sorry, Nathan.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.315
- About my dad or about us?
- About everything.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.996
So what are you doing here anyway?

08:43.080 --> 08:45.275
- Tour playing Tree Hill?
- No.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.631
They wanted me to become a solo artist
and record a record or something,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.716
but it didn't matter without you.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.109
None of it mattered without you.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.388
- I made a lot of mistakes, Nathan.
- That's right.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.630
And if you left the tour for me,
you made another one,

09:02.720 --> 09:04.438
because I'm leaving in the morning.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.511
I'm going to High Flyers.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.473
Well, good.

09:11.520 --> 09:15.308
Good, you deserve it.
You deserve to have whatever you want.

09:16.480 --> 09:21.156
Listen, there's no more apartment
and I put all your stuff in storage,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.995
so you can spend the night
in the guest room if you want.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.878
Nathan, there wasn't a moment
when I was away

09:35.960 --> 09:38.315
that my heart wasn't with you in Tree Hill.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.879
That's great.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.796
But I'm still leaving tomorrow.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.357
Unlike you, I'm taking my heart with me.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.551
You talking to me yet?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.312
- Yeah.
- Good.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.839
- And I brought you flowers.
- Oh?

10:09.240 --> 10:12.277
They're very nice.
Where did you get them?

10:12.360 --> 10:13.952
Neighbor's yard.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.235
- Look, I'm sorry about the airport earlier.
- It's cool.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.990
No, I felt stupid for jumping to conclusions

10:23.080 --> 10:26.277
and maybe a little jealous
that you weren't actually there for me.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.036
It's good to see you, Luke.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.515
How you been?

10:38.720 --> 10:41.029
Tell me that was a goodbye kiss.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.870
I want to be with you, Brooke.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.120
Look, I know it wasn't fair

10:48.200 --> 10:50.760
how I told you I wanted to be with you

10:50.840 --> 10:53.638
when your cab's just parked right outside.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.230
I just saw you slipping away,
and I guess I panicked.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.359
It's okay.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.112
Really, it is.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.712
I actually had the whole summer
to think about this

11:04.800 --> 11:07.439
and I thought we could
totally have a summer-like fling

11:07.520 --> 11:09.112
just in the fall.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.155
And nonexclusive.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.353
Nonexclusive? How's that work?

11:16.720 --> 11:19.837
Well, we hang out, we go to movies,
we have fun.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.033
- Do we kiss?
- You bet your ass we kiss.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.991
Do we do more than kiss?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.194
Maybe.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.835
But we also date other people.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.317
So what do you think?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.749
I kind of think you're a genius.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.713
Oh, you're just figuring that out now,
are you?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.076
I missed you, Lucas Scott.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.835
And I missed you, too, pretty girl.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.519
Call me later.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.956
I have to go deal with Peyton's whole
"I'm your mother" scenario.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.031
Right, that one's pretty messy.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.712
Yeah, so I've heard.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.110
You know, you leave for a couple months,
crazy moms start showing up

12:04.200 --> 12:06.839
and there's all these things
you don't know.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.349
Yeah.

12:16.520 --> 12:21.116
- Did you hear something?
- Look, Peyton, I locked all the doors.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.598
I didn't hear anything. You're fine, okay?

12:28.840 --> 12:32.071
So, Brooke said you kept some of the stuff

12:32.160 --> 12:34.355
from when we were sort of...

12:34.440 --> 12:36.078
Whatever we were.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.270
She thinks you're still into me.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.193
I told Brooke
I wanted to be with her today,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.038
before she left.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.319
Nice timing.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.830
I'm a real piece of work, huh?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.749
I mean, every time I play it in my mind

12:55.840 --> 12:59.276
this "idiot" light keeps flashing at me.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.357
"Shut up, shut up."

13:02.760 --> 13:03.875
Yeah.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.794
Either you say too much or,
like me with Jake,

13:06.880 --> 13:09.758
you don't say enough,
and then they're gone.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.951
Yeah. Sorry about Jake.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.797
Yeah, me, too. It broke my heart.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.389
It's been a tough year on hearts.

13:21.880 --> 13:26.078
So, it's too bad we had to be
this desperate to hang out again, huh?

13:26.240 --> 13:28.959
Well, we didn't have to be. We just are.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.270
But I'm glad you're here, you know.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.352
I know we kind of lost each other
for a while,

13:35.880 --> 13:37.677
but, hopefully, that's over, right?

13:37.760 --> 13:40.228
Especially considering our history.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.434
It's always gonna be there, isn't it?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.473
You and me?

14:03.480 --> 14:04.993
Hi, sweetheart.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.594
- Is it true?
- Honey, look...

14:07.680 --> 14:09.716
You said you wanted
to talk about it face-to-face, Dad.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.631
So we're face-to-face.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.796
Is this woman my mother?

14:15.280 --> 14:18.875
Your mom is gone, Peyton. You know that.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.078
But your biological mother is alive.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.271
I never knew your father.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.712
We only met Ellie.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.351
We asked that
she not make contact with you

15:24.440 --> 15:26.396
unless you requested it.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.116
You know, sometimes it's hard for me
to look at you without seeing your mom.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.072
You got so much from her
in such a short time.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.868
What did I get from her exactly?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.598
Other than lies?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.512
Just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.591
You mean, other than you?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.314
Sorry.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.678
That wasn't fair.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.112
This is really weird, Nathan.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.918
You know, I can just call Peyton
or Lucas or something.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.831
No, Haley, it's late.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.511
Besides, what's the difference?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.955
You turn the lights out,
it's all the same darkness, right?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.359
Nathan...

16:53.720 --> 16:55.153
You know,

16:55.800 --> 16:59.759
you know when you took those drugs
before the game where you collapsed?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.472
You made a mistake.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.555
But I know you promised yourself
that if you had a second chance,

17:06.640 --> 17:08.994
you would do things differently.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.231
I know that I hurt you.

17:15.079 --> 17:18.435
But I promised myself that
if I could get you to listen,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.150
I would tell you that

17:23.160 --> 17:25.515
there was never a day on that tour

17:25.599 --> 17:28.797
when I didn't think
you were the best part of my life.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.438
You can't just say that, Haley.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.750
- Not after months of silence.
- Why? It's the truth.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.909
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.116
What about the day you signed
the annulment papers?

17:36.200 --> 17:38.156
- The papers that you initiated?
- Yeah.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.676
After I drove a thousand miles to see you
and you didn't even call me after I left.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.752
- Must have been a hell of an encore.
- Nathan, you just walked away!

17:44.840 --> 17:46.910
Well, it beats running away.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.468
- I did call.
- You called our answering machine, Haley!

17:49.560 --> 17:51.551
Because I knew that you were gonna
hang up on me anyway,

17:51.640 --> 17:54.712
- so I had to leave a message!
- I didn't even play it.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.839
I deleted you.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.878
Well, then you deleted this.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.639
I was being childish when I walked away
from you for the tour.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.272
You gave me an ultimatum
the night that I left

18:15.120 --> 18:17.998
and I fought back
for all the wrong reasons.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.516
And I was being stubborn

18:21.680 --> 18:25.116
and I can't take that back.
I wish that I could.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.076
Did I want to go? Yeah.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.873
I loved it. I loved every night of it.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.195
But I want you to know something,
Nathan.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.236
There was never a night

18:39.560 --> 18:42.279
where I loved it more than I loved you.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.318
Pretty angry, huh?

19:00.560 --> 19:01.709
Yeah.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.795
You can probably tell
that Nathan's not here.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.117
- He moved out before he left for camp.
- Yeah, I know.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.715
I'd say "welcome back,"
but I don't suppose you're staying.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.838
- No, I am.
- Oh.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.108
Well, you might be staying,
but you're not staying here.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.040
I just rented this place. For me.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.996
How you feeling, Mouth?

19:44.680 --> 19:45.874
Mouth?

19:47.560 --> 19:50.438
Weak. I'm feeling
seriously underdeveloped.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.079
Could have fooled me.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.676
Who would've thought you could move
all this stuff in here by yourself, huh?

19:57.960 --> 19:59.473
Yeah, who knew.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.754
- Here.
- Thanks.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.956
So, are any of these guys the reason
you don't want to date Lucas?

20:10.920 --> 20:13.912
No. I date Lucas, just not exclusively.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.032
So it's kind of like with Felix?

20:17.760 --> 20:22.072
God, no. Felix was a physical thing.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.431
I'd go for some romance with Lucas.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.716
- But you won't commit to him?
- No, too much trauma.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.237
I don't know, Brooke.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.197
I felt larger than life
when I was with Erica.

20:34.240 --> 20:38.233
- I'd give anything to have that back.
- You and Erica broke up?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.832
- Yeah.
- Why? What happened?

20:43.800 --> 20:45.438
She got popular.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.793
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.633
It is so much better to play the field.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.868
Davis.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.959
Come on.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.158
- Hey, Mouth, nice work.
- Why is that?

21:11.840 --> 21:14.195
Brooke gets a place of her own,
you already got her in the bedroom.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.874
- Easy on the skanky innuendo.
- I'm gonna get some more stuff.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.436
You could get the couch.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.989
Yeah.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.192
All right, total reverse déjà vu.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.429
I moved all of Nathan's crap
out of here three months ago.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.358
Oh, but this is gonna be so much better

21:32.200 --> 21:35.192
because this is our new
post-game party palace.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.117
All it needs is a P. Sawyer makeover,
a little paint,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.515
a couple of those creepy "nobody
understands me" drawings that you do

21:40.280 --> 21:42.111
and a batch of hot boys.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.950
Hence the skanky innuendo.

21:45.800 --> 21:50.078
First thing we have to do is cover up
Nathan's hideous paint stain.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.754
I don't know. I say you leave it.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.996
We can't leave it,
Haley's gonna be here now and then.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.874
- She can't be looking at that.
- Why not? It's her fault it's there.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.719
You and Haley fighting?

22:02.440 --> 22:04.158
That depends on which Haley
we're talking about.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.434
Haley Scott, the nice girl that played Tric,

22:05.720 --> 22:07.756
or Haley James, the not-so-much-of-a-wife

22:08.320 --> 22:12.199
that left town and never called,
because, her, I have a problem with.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.515
Maybe she just got scared
of needing somebody too much.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.832
Needing them so much,
she just abandoned them?

22:24.640 --> 22:27.313
Okay, you can hate me for saying this,

22:28.840 --> 22:30.751
but maybe your problem
isn't so much with Haley

22:31.680 --> 22:33.636
as it is with Ellie,
your returning birth mother?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.830
No, Brooke, my problem is with anybody

22:35.720 --> 22:37.711
who just vanishes
and then waltzes back in

22:37.960 --> 22:39.678
and expects to be instantly forgiven.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.793
Your problem is you're not gonna have
anybody to help you paint this place

22:41.840 --> 22:43.637
if you keep telling me what my problem is.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.636
Sorry. Too angry?

22:48.360 --> 22:50.635
- Just a smidge.
- Dialing back.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.913
Thank you.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.149
Look,

22:54.920 --> 22:58.754
all I'm saying is we both know
what it's like to have your heart broken.

22:57.160 --> 23:00.869
Maybe Haley just needs a little help,
whether or not she's to blame.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.389
<i>Hey!</i>

23:22.720 --> 23:24.199
Are you okay?

23:24.720 --> 23:25.948
Depends.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.191
Are you home for good?

23:29.920 --> 23:31.319
Or for bad.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.949
Good.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.516
Your mom didn't sleep for a week
when we brought you home.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.516
Every cough, every gurgle,

24:07.200 --> 24:10.431
she'd be up and have you
in her arms immediately.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.319
One time,

24:14.440 --> 24:18.797
I teased her about it and she said,
"I'm always gonna be there for her.

24:16.240 --> 24:20.199
"No matter what.
She's gonna know her mother loves her."

24:22.200 --> 24:25.829
Honey, we were gonna tell you together.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.038
But when she died,

24:36.400 --> 24:39.597
I guess I didn't want to confuse your grief,

24:39.160 --> 24:43.551
and I felt so powerless
that I couldn't protect you from losing her.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.512
You know,
I look at this drawing and I think

24:53.560 --> 24:55.994
you can be mad at me if it helps.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.400
But you leave your mom out of it

25:01.920 --> 25:04.195
because she never lied to you

25:06.120 --> 25:08.793
and she loved you with all her heart.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.315
And this other woman, Ellie,

25:15.080 --> 25:17.992
she doesn't change who your mom was.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.958
So don't you...

25:29.080 --> 25:30.672
Don't you dare.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.635
Who is the sexy world traveler?

25:46.800 --> 25:49.394
- It's so good to see you.
- Welcome back.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.270
So, what do you think of the place?

25:51.880 --> 25:54.348
Well, Lucas said it was different.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.270
It's pretty edgy, but I like it.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.030
- And change is good.
- Yeah.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.235
How have you been?

26:01.960 --> 26:04.235
Well, as you know
from my e-mails about Dan,

26:03.160 --> 26:05.674
I have been one miserable bitch. You?

26:05.520 --> 26:08.557
- Well, I've been the miserable part.
- I'm sorry.

26:08.240 --> 26:11.277
- I guess that means Andy's not back.
- Not yet.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.278
Well, we'll see.
Hopefully, he'll be back soon.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.318
- Have you heard from Keith?
- No, I haven't. I guess you haven't either?

26:17.920 --> 26:20.070
Hey, can a girl get a decent cup a joe
around here?

26:23.480 --> 26:27.075
- One song per cup. I've missed you, kiddo.
- I missed you, too.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.996
I could use a cup of gin...
I mean, coffee, myself.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.435
Karen?

26:32.760 --> 26:35.832
- Yeah, please. Coffee, not gin.
- I'll have gin.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.757
So what brings you around,
Miss Jet-setter?

26:37.440 --> 26:40.477
Well, considering what they pay
the opening acts,

26:39.400 --> 26:41.436
I was kind of hoping for a job.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.190
Actually, I was just kind of hoping
to waitress like before.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.190
Table five needs a cleanup.
Let's see what you got.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.151
- I'm on it.
- All right.

26:59.640 --> 27:03.394
Well, we were out of gin
so I went with coffee.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.159
Thank you.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.079
You know,

27:35.880 --> 27:39.350
I had my first performance right here,
just for Nathan.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.749
Have you talked to him
since he left for camp?

27:42.800 --> 27:46.270
No, he never picked up, so I wrote letters.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.713
Are you awake?

28:05.400 --> 28:06.515
Yeah.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.070
Will you talk to me, please?

28:10.040 --> 28:12.759
I don't know what to say to you, Haley.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.870
And part of me just wants to find
the right words to hurt you,

28:17.120 --> 28:19.111
the same way you hurt me.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.397
I am hurting, Nathan.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.513
You mean, because I made out with Chris?

28:28.240 --> 28:31.277
Because I turned my back on us
and walked away?

28:31.080 --> 28:33.310
Oh, wait. That was you.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.232
Always and forever.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.109
What?

28:43.680 --> 28:44.954
Nothing.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.434
Hales?

28:53.200 --> 28:56.556
Nathan, please, I just want to talk to you.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.319
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.231
Haley, I can't do this.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.039
I'm sorry. You need to go, all right?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.708
Please.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.558
I understand if you don't love me anymore.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.918
Always and forever.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.391
That's what sucks, Haley.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.632
I still do love you.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.593
I always will.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.076
I just can't trust you.

29:55.840 --> 29:56.909
Dan.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.957
You found the papers?

30:18.800 --> 30:22.236
- These are our divorce papers, Deb.
- You've recovered,

30:29.320 --> 30:32.790
and so have I,
but our marriage isn't going to.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.592
It's time to end it.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.157
"But if he could once return to that
certain starting place

30:46.800 --> 30:50.634
"and go over it all slowly perhaps
he could find that thing he was missing."

30:49.920 --> 30:51.876
Divorce is fine, Deb.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.232
You seem surprised.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.190
But I guess, at a certain point,
the fire burns out.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.030
I think I'll go for a walk.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.958
How much for a broken heart
with a side of regret?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.470
More than you want to know.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.635
So when you're done here,
bring your stuff to the apartment.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.959
- Why?
- Because you're moving in with me.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.033
Why would you do that?

31:45.240 --> 31:46.798
Because you need a place to live,

31:46.760 --> 31:49.320
and I need rent money to pay for
my new back-to-school wardrobe.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.234
So the way I see it, you move in,
I look hot, you don't get crabs at a shelter.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.519
Works for me.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.838
So the whole summer, and I still
can't get used to that hair of yours.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.755
What?

32:08.600 --> 32:12.115
You did yours last spring,
and mine actually looks good.

32:09.800 --> 32:14.749
Plus, Ellie had the whole long-hair thing
and I don't want to look anything like her.

32:13.920 --> 32:17.549
Yeah, I met her once.
Before I knew who she was.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.355
You haven't heard from her all summer?

32:25.000 --> 32:27.958
No, not since I slammed the door
in her face.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.874
Weird e-mails stopped coming?

32:30.480 --> 32:32.630
Yeah. Why?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.270
She's back, Peyton. Ellie.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.632
I saw her today.

32:40.040 --> 32:43.157
Yo, big time.
I'm gonna see you at that party, right?

32:45.760 --> 32:48.638
- Maybe, we'll see.
- "Maybe, we'll see"?

32:48.960 --> 32:50.598
All right, but if you don't show up,

32:51.920 --> 32:54.388
I might booty call that girl
that sent you that letter now.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.517
- All right.
- All right.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.474
Hey, yo, Nate,

33:00.120 --> 33:02.190
you can't get it all back at once, man.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.955
Take it slow. Give it some time.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.354
Pretty soon, you'll be back,
better than ever.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.953
All right?

33:10.280 --> 33:11.918
Catch you later.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.074
Okay, here's the deal.

33:54.520 --> 33:58.274
I got room for you but not a lot of pity.
You did what you did, and it's done.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.758
- Take it or leave it.
- I'll take it.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.313
All right. Come on in, roommate.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.757
- May the grace of God be with you.
- Yeah, okay.

34:32.159 --> 34:35.869
I got to tell you, padre, this isn't exactly
my home court, you know.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.389
Never had much use for religion.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.031
I guess what you call kindness
I call weakness.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.949
But, no man is bulletproof. I know that.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.638
After all, they crucified your boy,
didn't they?

34:51.880 --> 34:53.916
What troubles you, my son?

34:54.840 --> 34:57.877
What troubles me
is how I've made mistakes.

34:59.880 --> 35:04.032
How I lie awake at night
keeping company with regret, fallibility.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.559
I've not been the man I intended to be.

35:12.120 --> 35:13.712
That troubles me.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.874
And you've come seeking absolution?

35:17.560 --> 35:19.915
Yeah, I suppose I have.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.636
Let me ask you something.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.349
Is it possible to grant forgiveness
for sinful acts yet to be committed?

35:29.360 --> 35:31.590
I'm afraid I don't understand.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.317
It's simple, really.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.071
Three months ago,
someone tried to kill me.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.913
They drugged me and left me for dead.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.030
I pretended not to remember.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.553
But, in fact, every night since,
I've tried to piece it together.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.915
And when I find out who did this to me,
and I will find out soon,

36:08.680 --> 36:12.150
the sins I commit then
could turn this place to rubble.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.829
Aren't you afraid of swimming alone?

36:24.360 --> 36:26.590
Well, beats being alone on land.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.796
- Looking for me?
- Sort of.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.669
How come?

36:32.000 --> 36:35.675
I just wanted to know if
you wanted to hang out, grab some food.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.391
- Keep it casual.
- Casual is good.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.399
Have a seat.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.156
This is gonna work, right?

36:54.160 --> 36:56.549
- What's that?
- Us dating.
