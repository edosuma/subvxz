02:08.800 --> 02:10.279
Hi.

02:10.639 --> 02:14.872
I'm Billy Ray Wetnap
from Pest Boys Exterminators...

02:15.280 --> 02:18.909
...where our motto is,
"There's no bug we can't plug."

02:19.560 --> 02:22.199
And to prove it,
our very own Verminator...

02:22.440 --> 02:24.749
...has volunteered
to get into this glass cage...

02:25.000 --> 02:28.037
...with 10,000
Peruvian stinging beetles.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.679
Stinging beetles?
You said they were gonna be ladybugs.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.672
Now, she is armed with nothing
but her Verminator spray gun...

02:40.920 --> 02:45.232
...filled with our new poison,
RU Dead 42.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.991
It's not working.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.078
The reason that the Peruvian
stinging beetle is so large...

02:56.320 --> 03:00.438
...is that 80 percent of his body weight
is pure D venom.

03:06.680 --> 03:11.470
They don't even lose their stingers
like them sissified African killer bees.

03:25.040 --> 03:29.750
Well, it looks like our very own
Verminator's in a little bit of trouble.

03:30.480 --> 03:35.076
But you won't be if you call Manny,
me or Ma at Pest Boys Exterminators.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.436
Call 1-800-LEGS-UP...

03:37.640 --> 03:41.918
...where our motto is,
"If you wish it, we will squish it."

03:46.320 --> 03:48.356
Well, Ma, it says right here:

03:48.600 --> 03:51.990
"The Peruvian beetle sting
can cause temporary insanity.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.834
But on the bright side,
it has a delightful mating call...

03:55.040 --> 03:56.837
...and stays crunchy in milk."

03:58.280 --> 04:01.431
Well, the doctor said
she seems to be fine.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.791
The pods! The pods!
They're opening!

04:06.040 --> 04:08.349
Is that you, Napoleon?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.993
No, Rhett, it's me.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.950
And mark my words,
the South shall rise again.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.798
Peg.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.152
Peg. Bud.
Man, do I have good news.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.472
Al, aren't you forgetting someone?

04:35.920 --> 04:38.388
Oh, Peg, she's nuts.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.472
Nuts or not,
she is still our daughter.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.631
Oh, all right, Peg.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.597
Hi, pumpkin.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.117
Isn't that cute. I used to call her
pumpkin, now she is one.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.798
But, Peg, anyway, like I was saying,
man, I got good news.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.190
Tomorrow, not only
will I be selling shoes...

04:58.440 --> 05:00.908
...I will be selling ladies' handbags.

05:03.440 --> 05:07.228
That high school diploma
is really starting to pay off.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.911
Anyway, Kelly...

05:10.360 --> 05:13.272
...guess who has the job
of hiring the new employee?

05:13.520 --> 05:17.229
Oh, now, I wouldn't go
ploughing today, Brer Bear.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.237
Let me try this one more time
while the liquor stores are open.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.277
Al, are you trying to tell us...

05:27.520 --> 05:30.193
...that they're gonna put you
in charge of doing the hiring?

05:30.600 --> 05:34.798
Yes, I am. And let us hope I pick more
carefully than I've done in the past.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.871
I must be careful and selective.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.237
I must not hire the first boob
who walks in the door.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.599
You're hired.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.830
Shouldn't I fill out
an application first?

05:59.440 --> 06:00.919
Oh, good idea.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.712
Here you are.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.233
Right over here. Have a seat.
Get off.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.272
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.512
Threats don't frighten me.
I'm married.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.473
To my job,
not to some giant big redhead.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.157
Where it says "name,"
do you want mine?

06:23.400 --> 06:27.109
No.
Just a simple naked photo will do.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.715
Well, well, well.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.513
It's true what they say.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.389
Even in hard times
consumers still flock to quality.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.959
Excuse me, Al.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.236
Is this seat taken?

06:53.720 --> 06:57.429
Or this one? Or this one?

06:58.800 --> 07:00.597
Marcie, come here.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.637
Look. There's a woman.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.795
Aren't they something?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.232
So, what do you want?

07:12.480 --> 07:16.109
Jefferson has something to say.
Jefferson?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.957
Yeah, Al, I'm...

07:19.200 --> 07:22.033
I'm here to apply for the j...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.876
- For the j...
- Job! Job! Say it!

07:26.320 --> 07:28.072
I am tired of coming home
every night...

07:28.280 --> 07:31.272
...and finding you watching
the Home Shopping Network.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.078
Look, Marcie, I don't know
the first thing about selling shoes.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.709
Is this the right colour for me?

07:38.360 --> 07:41.716
Absolutely.
It brings out the violet in your eyes.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.716
I'll take 12.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.439
I'm sorry, Marcie. But the job
has already been filled by someone...

07:56.640 --> 07:57.914
...far more qualified.

07:58.160 --> 08:02.517
Mr. Bundy, where it says "date," do
you want his name or where we went?

08:05.960 --> 08:10.511
That's Heidi. She's dumb
as toast, but I'd kill for her.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.273
And I'd start with you.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.799
You piece of algae.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.471
If you think that I am
going to stand idly by...

08:19.720 --> 08:23.679
...and let you hire
some salute to silicone...

08:25.080 --> 08:28.868
...instead of an obviously qualified
person, then you're wrong, Al Bundy.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.193
I'll have my woman's group here so
fast it'll make your bulbous head swim.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.477
My Jefferson is
far more qualified than...

08:45.360 --> 08:50.150
I'm not just a shoe salesman.
I also direct movies for HBO.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.039
Let's go, Jefferson.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.475
Marcie, I thought you wanted me
to get a job.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.717
Your job is pleasing me,
and I am not pleased.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.757
That's my mom.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.360
"Sex." This could take a while.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.596
Can I write on the back?
The front's all full.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.832
Yes, yes. And feel free to move around
if you want to.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.515
I'm here to apply
for the shoe salesman's job.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.955
Job's taken. Get out.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.678
Polk High?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.837
Oh, Polk you're the best
Of all the schools

09:32.080 --> 09:34.355
- For you we'll always cheer
- For you we'll always cheer

09:34.560 --> 09:36.835
- By day we learn to read and write
- By day we learn to read and write

09:37.080 --> 09:39.389
- By night our team will fight, fight, fight
- By night our team will fight, fight, fight

09:39.640 --> 09:41.835
- No matter where we are
- No matter where we are

09:42.080 --> 09:44.116
- We'll always give a.
- We'll always give a.

09:44.360 --> 09:46.715
- For P-O-L-K
- P-O-L-K

09:46.960 --> 09:49.474
- Polk. Polk. Polk
- Polk. Polk. Polk.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.513
Aaron Mitchell. Class of '93.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.991
Al Bundy. All class, all the time.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.877
Wait a second.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.116
Al Bundy?

10:07.160 --> 10:08.718
The All-State Al Bundy?

10:09.240 --> 10:10.468
I was.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.472
- I thought you died in Nam.
- No.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.989
Well, actually, I started that rumour.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.994
Yeah, see, I died here at home,
victim of Agent Red.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.038
Al Bundy. Do you know
what a hero you are to me?

10:27.280 --> 10:30.750
I presume you're referring
to my four touchdowns in one game.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.833
Well, that and the four holes
you drilled into the walls...

10:34.040 --> 10:36.031
...of the girls locker room.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.914
For years I didn't think
women had heads.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.594
- Well, I see you play a little ball.
- No, no, no. You played ball.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.189
I was just All City.
I was lucky to get a scholarship.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.834
- I got a scholarship to college.
- And what happened?

10:55.160 --> 10:58.835
An injury. Tackle broke my leg.
Wife broke her water. The end.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.553
But...

11:01.800 --> 11:04.997
...all things considered, I think
things turned out pretty well.

11:05.240 --> 11:08.198
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.759
Well, sorry to hear the job's filled...

11:20.960 --> 11:24.077
...but you know, it was worth
the trip here just to meet you.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.238
If it's any consolation, the players
didn't start making big money...

11:27.440 --> 11:29.670
...till after your career
would've been over anyway.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.395
Well, that big shoe money's
still coming down.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.953
Hey, Bundy.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.793
Go deep.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.279
What the hell. You got the job.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.639
Really?

12:09.480 --> 12:10.833
Thanks, Mr. Bundy.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.555
Hey, I don't wanna impose,
but I got my football in the car.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.230
- Would you autograph it for me?
- Sure, kid. Go get it.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.996
Did I just hear you hire
someone else?

12:23.240 --> 12:27.153
Oh, yeah, you did.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.108
- What should I do?
- Well...

12:31.280 --> 12:32.918
Keep writing.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.677
Hi, honey.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.510
Al, I'll tell you,
we just got back from the doctor...

12:43.760 --> 12:45.830
...and he said that she's much better.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.279
Al, what's wrong?
Your face looks strange.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.039
Yeah, it's called a smile, Peg.
But don't worry about it.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.033
I'm not taking it home with me.
Peg, you should see.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.953
I just hired the best kid ever
to help me out in the store.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.237
He's a football hero at Polk High
last year. You should see him.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.153
He's the son I always wanted.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.078
And who's that over there?

13:11.320 --> 13:14.232
Oh, that's the wife I always wanted.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.479
Daddy?

13:23.160 --> 13:25.628
Peg, why can't we just put her
in David Letterman's house...

13:25.840 --> 13:27.432
...and get it over with?

13:28.080 --> 13:30.036
Come on, Kelly.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.637
- And how do we say goodbye?
- Alice, you're the greatest.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.197
I wanna thank you again, Mr. Bundy.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.749
- I really needed this job.
- That's okay. I know.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.319
College is expensive.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.471
Actually, that's pretty much paid for.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.830
I'm using this money to buy a ring
for my girl.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.871
We're gonna get married.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.510
What's wrong with getting married?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.359
Aaron...

14:10.880 --> 14:13.474
...sit down over here, son.
Let's have a chat.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.357
Now, I too am a great believer
in love.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.149
I wanna find it myself someday.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.999
But let me give you
a little bit of advice.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.390
Bed them, don't wed them.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.470
Do them, don't woo them.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.671
Date them, don't mate them.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.158
But Angie's different.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.312
- Well, she...
- Always lets you pick out the movie?

14:38.560 --> 14:41.028
Doesn't mind when you wanna watch
a ballgame?

14:41.280 --> 14:44.795
Can recognize a kitchen appliance
two out of three times?

14:45.400 --> 14:46.628
That's her.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.794
That's all women before the day.

14:51.840 --> 14:56.072
Mr. Bundy, I appreciate your concern,
but I want to get married.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.670
I see now what I have to do.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.473
Come with me.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.392
Where are we going?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.232
The mall lounge.

15:10.480 --> 15:14.553
Or as we like to call it,
"the valley of the shadow of death."

15:27.680 --> 15:29.671
There they are, son.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.431
The lost souls.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.672
The meek, the miserable,
the married.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.078
And over here are the lowest
of the lows.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.312
The ones relegated to holding
their wives' purses.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.711
What's wrong with him?

15:52.200 --> 15:55.317
His wife is shopping
at Victoria's Secret.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.755
She tried on a garter belt last week...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.230
...they haven't seen it since.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.714
And look over there
between Burt and Carson.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.035
Well, it's just an empty space.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.358
With your name on it, Aaron.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.518
Hey, come on, guys.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.558
What could be better
than two people loving each other...

16:19.800 --> 16:21.756
...and sharing the good times
and the bad?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.752
A steak?

16:24.840 --> 16:26.114
Fellas...

16:26.360 --> 16:28.920
...what we've got here
is a non-believer.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.831
A little marrying music, please.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.032
My wife will never cook or clean

16:44.280 --> 16:46.316
Still my money's spent

16:46.920 --> 16:49.639
Who knew when I first chose my mate

16:49.880 --> 16:52.394
That she would put on
That much weight

16:52.640 --> 16:54.835
More sex we'd lik e for sure

16:55.080 --> 16:57.548
If it only weren't with her

16:57.800 --> 17:00.872
Please K-l-L-L
K-l-L-L

17:01.080 --> 17:03.036
Me, me, me

17:13.000 --> 17:15.833
That's the marrying man's
fight song, son.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.877
That and taps.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.071
Good luck, Aaron.

17:36.760 --> 17:41.390
Thanks. It's much easier to fill this out
with the light on.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.072
Take your time.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.798
Hello. Is Aaron here?

17:48.040 --> 17:51.510
- I just came by to bring his lunch.
- Oh, thanks.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.834
You must be Angie.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.239
- His fiancée.
- Well, yes.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.996
You don't have to say it. I know.
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.028
Oh, but not as lucky as he is,
I'm sure.

18:10.280 --> 18:14.831
Why, he tells me you don't mind
when he watches sports.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.749
Which I think is good
because there's...

18:18.000 --> 18:21.595
There's a game on tonight and
I thought maybe I'd invite him over...

18:21.840 --> 18:23.159
...to watch it.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.752
Oh, I'm sure he'd love to.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.117
I'd watch it with you,
but I have a cooking class tonight.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.749
You like football and cooking?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.830
Sure. What woman doesn't?

18:47.320 --> 18:48.639
But...

18:50.560 --> 18:52.915
...l'll bet you like to eat, huh?

18:53.760 --> 18:56.035
Well, sure.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.751
You know, fruit, vegetables.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.795
My big weakness
is the Roy Rogers salad bar.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.156
Not that the food is bad,
I just feel guilty...

19:05.400 --> 19:07.960
...about spending $1.99 on myself.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.189
Don't take this personally,
but would you marry me?

19:19.440 --> 19:22.830
My wife wouldn't like it,
but she doesn't like anything I like.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.872
You're cute.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.118
Well, I better go
or I'll be late for work.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.074
You work?

19:36.880 --> 19:38.108
What else am I gonna do?

19:38.360 --> 19:42.035
Sit around the house all day
watching Oprah and eating bonbons?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.633
Well, at least I still have...

19:56.480 --> 19:58.118
A chair.

19:59.160 --> 20:03.392
Where a beautiful girl once sat.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.356
I need shoes.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.839
Peg?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.798
Oprah.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.871
You know, Peg, I made a mistake.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.749
This morning before I left I thought
that all women were totally useless.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.639
Now I realize it was just you.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.952
I thought all men were destined
to marry the worst possible mate...

20:31.200 --> 20:34.636
...but I now realize it was just me.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.236
Oh, hi, Al.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.112
I didn't hear you.
I was watching Oprah.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.193
That's all right, Peg.
I was talking to Oprah.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.359
But, you know what
I'm going to do now?

20:47.600 --> 20:49.670
I'm going to live the life
I should have had...

20:49.880 --> 20:52.838
...vicariously through Aaron.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.548
And I'm going to live my sports life
through him.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.394
I'm going to have dinner
through him.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.596
And if he'll let me, I'm even
going to have sex through him.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.270
Oh, hi, Al.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.873
I didn't hear you.
I was watching Oprah.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.396
If only Oprah were on
when I said, "I do."

21:17.280 --> 21:19.032
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it, Daddy.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.077
- Oh, hi, pumpkin.
- Hi.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.710
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine. I'm all better.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.076
Thattagirl.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.190
- Hi.
- Hi. Is Mr. Bundy here?

21:31.800 --> 21:34.473
You're that good football guy
everyone's talking about.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.517
Yeah, and what's your name?

21:36.760 --> 21:38.591
Thumbelina!

21:51.400 --> 21:53.152
Book 'em, Dano.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.992
A great daughter.
You must be very proud.

22:01.160 --> 22:05.312
I'd sell her for scrap if I could.
What's going on?

22:05.520 --> 22:08.239
I just stopped by to thank you
for setting me straight.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.916
You made me realize that I shouldn't
jump into marriage.

22:12.160 --> 22:16.073
So I broke off my engagement
with Angie.

22:16.760 --> 22:20.878
And decided to go back to the girl
I dated all through high school.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.997
And I want you to meet her.

22:41.080 --> 22:45.358
Mr. Bundy, I'd like you to meet Meg.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.712
Oprah!
