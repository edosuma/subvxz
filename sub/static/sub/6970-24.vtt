00:25.291 --> 00:27.744
All right, great.
Tell him to come on in.

00:27.779 --> 00:30.330
Excuse me.
Make way. Let her through.

00:31.598 --> 00:36.803
Agent scully? Detective
rempulski, alexandria p.d.

00:36.838 --> 00:39.155
Thanks for coming down
to do this.

00:50.683 --> 00:56.322
- It him?
- Yeah.

01:09.586 --> 01:11.704
Agent scully,
please have a seat.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.962
Agent scully,
we've had a brief discussion,

01:18.997 --> 01:23.316
but will you restate the matter
we're here to put to rest?

01:23.351 --> 01:25.268
Yes, sir.

01:28.271 --> 01:29.773
Four years ago,

01:30.273 --> 01:35.278
section chief blevins assigned me to
a project you all know as the x-files.

01:35.313 --> 01:39.783
As i am a medical doctor with
a background in hard science,

01:39.818 --> 01:43.787
my job was to provide
an analytical perspective...

01:43.822 --> 01:47.290
on the work
of special agent fox mulder...

01:47.325 --> 01:51.711
whose investigations
into the paranormal...

01:51.746 --> 01:54.297
were fueled
by a personal belief...

01:54.332 --> 01:59.252
that his sister had been
abducted by aliens when he was 12.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.723
I come here today,
four years later,

02:03.758 --> 02:09.229
to report on the illegitimacy
of agent mulder's work.

02:10.729 --> 02:14.234
It is my scientific opinion...

02:14.269 --> 02:17.737
that he became,
over the course of these years,

02:17.772 --> 02:20.156
a victim...

02:20.191 --> 02:24.160
a victim
of his own false hopes...

02:24.195 --> 02:26.663
and of his belief...

02:26.698 --> 02:29.165
in the biggest of lies.

03:22.051 --> 03:24.553
We're meeting the guide
at base camp.

03:25.054 --> 03:27.072
- He'll take us to the site.
- Has he seen it?

03:27.107 --> 03:30.826
Oh, yeah.
He said it's unbelievable.

04:05.661 --> 04:08.964
- How soon can we get to the site?
- Right now?

04:09.465 --> 04:11.717
We'd be pushing it
to be up top by nightfall.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.803
I'd rather sleep seeing it than
lay awake all night wondering.

04:14.838 --> 04:18.940
It's gonna take some work. I've
waited all my life for this day.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.694
Let's do it.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.973
Over here!

05:13.395 --> 05:15.197
How you doin'?

05:15.232 --> 05:17.383
Hello.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.152
I assume you're okay.
Nice to meet you. George.

05:29.928 --> 05:33.932
My god.
It's beautiful.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.409
Agent scully, i presume
you have a basis...

05:43.909 --> 05:45.661
for this break
from agent mulder.

05:45.696 --> 05:47.880
Yes, sir.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.132
Recent events
have shed new light...

05:50.167 --> 05:52.167
on the factual
and physical evidence...

05:52.202 --> 05:55.671
that would serve to prove the
existence of extraterrestrial life,

05:56.171 --> 05:59.925
which is the foundation of agent
mulder's consuming devotion to his work.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.610
What factual evidence?

06:01.645 --> 06:04.096
Agent mulder was recently
contacted by a man...

06:04.596 --> 06:08.801
whose pursuit of this evidence
seemed to coincide with his own.

06:08.836 --> 06:12.938
In his intense desire
to believe,

06:12.973 --> 06:15.941
agent mulder was duped
by this man.

06:16.442 --> 06:20.696
He was fooled by an act of
scientific sleight of hand...

06:20.731 --> 06:25.968
calculated to perpetuate
false truths, the larger lie.

06:26.003 --> 06:29.471
I am here today
to expose this lie,

06:29.506 --> 06:31.974
to show the mechanism
of deception...

06:32.009 --> 06:35.477
that drew him and me into it...

06:35.512 --> 06:38.981
and to expose agent
mulder's work for what it is.

06:46.438 --> 06:49.441
And grabbing him by the knees,
then him falling backwards,

06:49.476 --> 06:51.693
tumbling over me
and down the stairs.

06:51.728 --> 06:54.596
Hi. Speaking of bill, is he coming?

06:54.631 --> 06:57.750
Good evening. May i take
your coat? Thank you.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.535
There he is.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.005
Hi.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.508
Hello, dana.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.511
Look at you. Look at you, my big brother.

07:09.546 --> 07:12.314
I'm sorry i'm late.
My ship got stuck in traffic.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.320
Did you get my birthday card? Yes, i did.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.923
Thanks for remembering
this year. Once a decade.

07:20.958 --> 07:23.826
Father mccue, i've been waiting for you.

07:26.578 --> 07:28.997
How you feeling, dana?

07:29.032 --> 07:33.318
I'm fine. Let's get some
dinner, huh? Yeah, i'm starving.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.539
You came just in time.

07:43.780 --> 07:47.666
So the parrot says,
"i only got one question:

07:47.701 --> 07:49.668
What did that chicken
in there do?"

07:52.806 --> 07:56.708
- Mom, i'll open some more wine.
- Okay.

08:03.398 --> 08:07.402
I feel awkward sitting here.
I'm sure you do too.

08:07.437 --> 08:10.722
No. I'm sorry. I've known
your family for so many years.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.558
Your mother
asked me to come,

08:12.593 --> 08:15.677
that i might have
a word with you.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.480
I know it's been some time
since we've spoken ourselves,

08:18.515 --> 08:21.717
since you drifted
from the church.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.436
Father mccue... but at
a time of personal crisis,

08:24.471 --> 08:26.255
a threat to your health,

08:26.755 --> 08:32.144
turning back to your faith is
important and essential. Father mccue...

08:32.644 --> 08:36.648
i appreciate my mother's
concern... and yours,

08:37.149 --> 08:40.903
but i'm being treated for my cancer,
and i'm taking every precaution.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.971
Faith can make you
stronger.

08:46.474 --> 08:49.977
I haven't felt a need.

08:50.012 --> 08:52.980
I have strength, and...

08:53.015 --> 08:56.984
And i'm not going
to come running back now.

08:57.019 --> 08:58.986
It's just not who i am.

08:59.021 --> 09:01.489
I'd be lying to myself
and to you.

09:01.524 --> 09:05.359
Dana. Phone.

09:08.095 --> 09:10.081
Excuse me.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.041
- Hello.
- Scully, it's me. Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

09:20.076 --> 09:23.744
- No, is something the matter?
- I need your help on something.

09:23.779 --> 09:29.066
Somebody named arlinski just contacted me
at the smithsonian. Contacted you about what?

09:29.101 --> 09:32.520
About something he found on
a mountain in canada. What?

09:32.555 --> 09:35.940
I'd rather not talk about it over the phone.
I just need you to meet me at the smithsonian.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.142
- When?
- Right away.

09:44.849 --> 09:46.634
I'm on my way.

09:53.674 --> 09:56.143
I'm gonna have to apologize
to your brother and mother.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.446
This is something that just
couldn't wait, though. It's okay.

09:58.481 --> 10:00.248
Who is this arlinski?

10:00.748 --> 10:05.253
He's a forensics anthropologist that i've
been in contact with over the past four years.

10:05.288 --> 10:08.756
Several years ago he was involved in
a u.f.o. Photo enhancement scandal,

10:08.791 --> 10:11.259
but he continues
to profess his innocence.

10:11.294 --> 10:13.761
What am i coming to see?
I'm not going to tell you.

10:13.796 --> 10:15.763
I want you to decide
for yourself.

10:17.632 --> 10:19.717
By my rough estimate,

10:20.218 --> 10:22.220
from the sediment
in our ice core samples,

10:22.255 --> 10:25.389
the body you're looking at
is over 200 years old.

10:25.424 --> 10:28.025
It looks perfectly intact.
Yeah.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.027
That doesn't make sense. There
would have been signs of predation.

10:30.062 --> 10:34.365
Yeah, but the position he was found in,
stuffed in a crevice at high altitude,

10:34.400 --> 10:37.285
he may have frozen fast
enough to avoid being eaten.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.821
Does that fit geologically?
The area where he was found...

10:40.856 --> 10:43.658
is in the terminal moraine of a
glacier which has since receded.

10:43.693 --> 10:48.329
Two hundred years ago, the area where
he was frozen was within the tree line.

10:48.364 --> 10:50.381
- There would have been a thaw.
- Who found him?

10:50.416 --> 10:54.201
A canadian
geodetic survey team.

10:55.419 --> 10:58.205
Along with a colleague
of mine named babcock,

10:58.240 --> 11:01.342
they're all still up there
on the mountain.

11:01.377 --> 11:04.178
- Who else knows about this?
- No one.

11:05.413 --> 11:09.367
I know what
your first thought was,

11:09.402 --> 11:11.369
but the st. Elias range?

11:11.869 --> 11:13.704
That's a long way to go
for a hoax.

11:13.739 --> 11:18.859
- If you're gonna go, why not go all the way?
- I'm circumspect myself,

11:19.360 --> 11:21.696
but the ice core samples
i took can't be faked.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.714
You have the ice core
samples here?

11:23.749 --> 11:26.217
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.723
One taken from each side of the body.

11:32.758 --> 11:36.927
A 360-degree matching
integrity of sediment.

11:38.763 --> 11:40.765
It's my sincere belief...

11:40.800 --> 11:43.267
that what we have here...

11:43.302 --> 11:46.637
is the complete corpus of an
extraterrestrial biological entity.

11:46.672 --> 11:49.590
Absolute,
and irrefutable.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.343
Qualitatively indefensible.
You go public with this,

11:52.378 --> 11:54.679
and nobody is going
to believe you.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.581
You also risk never knowing because the same
people who buried the truth assiduously...

11:58.082 --> 12:01.519
will be in charge of its
authentication. That's why i came to you.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.587
I need to get the specimen
out so i can authenticate it.

12:03.622 --> 12:08.926
This body means everything
to you, agent mulder.

12:08.961 --> 12:12.430
You're gonna have the proof in
your hands. And what do you want?

12:12.465 --> 12:14.832
We just want the credit.

12:19.337 --> 12:22.740
Do you think it's foolish?
I have no opinion, actually.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.743
You have no opinion? This is
your holy grail, mulder, not mine.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.578
What is that
supposed to mean?

12:27.613 --> 12:30.931
It just means that proving to the
world the existence of alien life...

12:30.966 --> 12:32.717
is not my last, dying wish.

12:34.535 --> 12:37.288
How about santa claus
or the easter bunny?

12:37.323 --> 12:40.524
This is not some selfish
pet project of mine.

12:41.025 --> 12:44.528
I'm as skeptical of that man as
you are, but definitive proof...

12:44.563 --> 12:48.532
of sentient beings sharing time and
existence with us would change everything.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.534
Every truth we live by
would be shaken to the ground.

12:50.569 --> 12:54.321
There is no greater revelation imaginable,
no greater scientific discovery.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.091
You already believe, mulder.
What difference will it make?

12:57.126 --> 12:59.093
What will proof change for you?

13:00.995 --> 13:04.749
If someone could prove to you the
existence of god, would it change you?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.518
Only if it had been disproven.

13:07.553 --> 13:10.805
Then you accept the possibility
that belief in god is a lie?

13:10.840 --> 13:13.224
I don't think about it,
actually,

13:13.259 --> 13:15.559
and i don't think
that it can be proven.

13:15.594 --> 13:18.863
But what if it could be? Wouldn't
that knowledge be worth seeking?

13:18.898 --> 13:22.099
Or is it just easier
to go on believing the lie?

13:23.567 --> 13:25.519
I can't go with you, mulder.

13:25.554 --> 13:30.374
Can you at least take a look at those
core samples and tell me if they're a lie?

13:30.409 --> 13:32.777
That's all i'm asking.

13:37.114 --> 13:39.500
What i couldn't tell
agent mulder,

13:39.535 --> 13:41.786
what i had only
just learned myself,

13:41.821 --> 13:46.657
was that the cancer which had been
diagnosed in me several months earlier...

13:47.158 --> 13:48.959
had metastasized.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.713
The doctors told me,
short of a miracle,

13:52.748 --> 13:57.218
it would continue
to aggressively invade my body,

13:57.253 --> 14:02.723
advancing faster each day
towards the inevitable.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.210
What's that for?

14:43.028 --> 14:45.898
I don't know these men well.
Do you?

14:45.933 --> 14:51.003
- Well enough.
- I'm gonna be up here alone until you get back.

14:51.038 --> 14:53.289
I hope i don't have to use it.

14:59.011 --> 15:01.313
I think you better
have a look at this.

15:05.684 --> 15:07.186
We were doing a lateral cut
to the back corner...

15:07.686 --> 15:10.072
when i saw something
in the ice.

15:10.107 --> 15:12.925
Right here.

15:15.394 --> 15:17.896
What do you think that is?

15:20.899 --> 15:24.186
I don't know. It could be
a bubble, a weak spot.

15:25.971 --> 15:30.743
Or a casting channel,
a pour hole.

15:30.778 --> 15:34.229
Liquid poured in
from the side or above somehow.

15:34.264 --> 15:36.732
Poured from where?

15:36.767 --> 15:40.019
I don't know. The angle
wouldn't make sense.

15:40.054 --> 15:44.223
Yeah, you're right.

15:52.247 --> 15:55.751
We'll never know
until we get it out of there.

16:16.822 --> 16:20.325
The iron concentration, density and
temperature profiles are all consistent.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.829
There's a tight matrix of
crystals at approximal center,

16:23.864 --> 16:26.331
suggesting the quick-freezing
scenario you mentioned.

16:26.832 --> 16:29.334
Here at the terminus, you've got
some particulate hydrocarbons:

16:29.835 --> 16:32.121
Jet fuel pollutants found just
about everywhere in the world.

16:32.156 --> 16:36.792
But not in old ice? Don't
misunderstand. This is old ice.

16:36.827 --> 16:41.447
This sample has numerous layers of sedimentation,
like the rings on a tree essentially.

16:41.482 --> 16:47.269
So it hasn't been tampered
with? Not from what i can see.

16:47.304 --> 16:49.138
Can i ask why it is
you're testing this ice?

16:49.173 --> 16:52.374
Another agent asked me to.

16:52.409 --> 16:53.976
Do you know where
this sample came from?

16:54.011 --> 16:57.780
From a site
in the yukon territory.

16:57.815 --> 17:02.418
Why? There's some cellular
material within the matrix.

17:02.453 --> 17:06.688
- Plant or animal?
- I don't know. It's what i'd have to classify a chimera,

17:06.723 --> 17:09.942
a hybrid cell.
From what?

17:09.977 --> 17:14.128
- As i said, i don't know.
- Is it capable of cell division?

17:14.164 --> 17:16.598
I don't know that either.
I've just now found them.

17:17.098 --> 17:19.885
I'd like to get them under our
electron microscope, if that's okay.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.670
Yes, please.

18:41.033 --> 18:43.485
I thought you said
there was someone meeting us.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.721
Yeah, a guide named ralston.

19:06.925 --> 19:08.794
I don't get it.

19:08.829 --> 19:13.432
This had all been arranged. He knew he
was supposed to take us up to the summit.

19:14.766 --> 19:18.053
I don't know what to do.

19:24.226 --> 19:27.229
We can probably follow
this track right up to the site.

19:27.264 --> 19:29.731
Maybe we'll meet him
on the way down.

19:43.529 --> 19:46.999
Funny place
to take a nap.

19:54.941 --> 19:56.592
He's been shot.
Oh, god.

19:56.627 --> 20:00.196
- This our guide?
- Yeah.

20:41.254 --> 20:44.674
Excuse me.
I'm looking for dr. Vitagliano.

20:46.409 --> 20:48.728
Dr. Vitagliano...
is he here?

20:48.763 --> 20:52.064
Uh, no, i'm afraid not.

20:52.099 --> 20:55.785
I was supposed to meet him here.
Actually, i'm a little late.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.087
Sorry.

22:39.021 --> 22:40.856
Oh, my god.

22:41.991 --> 22:45.144
They're all dead.
They've been shot.

22:50.182 --> 22:52.134
Babcock!

22:56.088 --> 22:57.590
The body.

23:09.018 --> 23:12.805
It's gone.
They took it!

23:20.212 --> 23:23.199
No one knew.
We didn't tell a soul.

23:23.234 --> 23:27.203
They had radio communication. Maybe
it was being monitored. Wait. Shh!

23:35.361 --> 23:36.862
Someone's still alive.

23:39.749 --> 23:41.534
It's babcock.

23:41.569 --> 23:43.319
Get me some water.

23:48.824 --> 23:50.709
It looks like
he took a shotgun hit.

23:50.744 --> 23:54.530
It didn't open him up too badly.
The bleeding's stopped.

23:54.565 --> 23:57.416
Who did this?

23:57.451 --> 24:00.286
- here you go.
- They took our body, babcock.

24:00.321 --> 24:04.073
- No... i buried it.
- Where?

24:32.134 --> 24:35.938
Dana?
Bill.

24:35.973 --> 24:37.806
What are you doing here?

24:37.841 --> 24:40.776
I picked up the phone
when they called mom's.

24:41.276 --> 24:43.028
Said you could use
a change of clothes.

24:43.063 --> 24:47.166
Thank you.
Where's mom?

24:49.301 --> 24:51.303
I didn't tell mom
what happened.

24:55.274 --> 25:00.279
So what did happen?
I, uh...

25:00.314 --> 25:01.780
i was knocked down
a flight of stairs,

25:02.281 --> 25:04.283
but i'm okay, luckily.

25:05.734 --> 25:07.569
You're not okay, dana.

25:11.323 --> 25:15.110
I know about your cancer.

25:17.062 --> 25:20.015
- I told mom not to tell you.
- Why?

25:23.835 --> 25:25.704
Because it's very personal.

25:29.007 --> 25:30.893
Because i don't want sympathy.

25:32.294 --> 25:34.079
You think you can cure yourself.

25:34.114 --> 25:39.334
Mom tells me
that you've gotten worse,

25:39.369 --> 25:41.670
that your cancer's gone
into your bloodstream.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.743
What are you doing at work,
getting knocked down and beaten up?

25:47.778 --> 25:50.546
What are you trying to prove?
That you're gonna go out fighting?

25:50.581 --> 25:52.097
Come on, bill.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.051
You know what
mom's going through?

25:57.836 --> 25:59.955
Why do you think i didn't
tell her when they called?

25:59.990 --> 26:03.041
- What should i be doing?
- We have a responsibility,

26:03.076 --> 26:05.427
not just to ourselves,
but to the people in our lives!

26:05.462 --> 26:09.865
Just because i haven't bared my soul
to you or to father mccue or to god...

26:09.900 --> 26:13.702
doesn't mean that i'm not
responsible to what's important to me.

26:13.737 --> 26:16.555
To what? To who?
This guy, mulder?

26:18.507 --> 26:22.311
Where is he, dana?
Where is he through all this?

26:31.653 --> 26:34.856
- Thank you for coming.
- Dana...

27:50.298 --> 27:54.803
We should be able to do a good enough examination
of the body right here to remove any doubt.

27:54.838 --> 27:57.539
We won't know for sure until
we do a carbon dating test.

27:57.574 --> 28:00.409
I'm anticipating his physiology
alone is going to be telltale.

28:00.444 --> 28:03.412
The piltdown man hoax wasn't
uncovered for 40 years...

28:03.447 --> 28:06.281
until it failed the carbon dating
test, and that wasn't even very good.

28:06.316 --> 28:10.318
If this were a hoax, would we have
six dead men up on that mountain?

28:10.353 --> 28:14.723
Somebody other than us
sure as hell believes it's not.

28:19.061 --> 28:22.330
As you can imagine, that's
a heavily trafficked stairwell,

28:22.365 --> 28:26.835
so we went back to the bio lab where
we found an anomalous set of latents.

28:26.870 --> 28:30.622
We found a partial matching in the
stairwell four centimeters from one of yours.

28:30.657 --> 28:33.275
- Have you run it through the n.c.i.c.?
- Yep.

28:33.775 --> 28:36.144
This is your assailant. Unfortunately,
he doesn't have a criminal record.

28:38.130 --> 28:39.931
Try the federal database.

28:46.455 --> 28:50.175
I'll be damned. How'd you know
it would be a government employee?

28:50.210 --> 28:52.828
Where does he work?

28:52.863 --> 28:55.113
Right here in washington.

28:55.148 --> 28:58.967
Michael kritschgau,
formerly of the u.s. Army,

28:59.002 --> 29:02.137
now attached to the pentagon's
research division in virginia.

29:06.625 --> 29:09.344
Is this the man?

29:23.809 --> 29:27.729
The body is
147 centimeters long,

29:27.764 --> 29:31.099
weighing 24 kilograms
deliquesced.

29:37.172 --> 29:42.994
Derma is hairless gray with an
elephantine texture with no odor.

29:43.029 --> 29:46.898
There are some small eruptions
on the surface of the skin,

29:46.933 --> 29:52.404
mostly likely due to the presence
of iron phosphate in the ice.

29:52.439 --> 29:57.893
Otherwise there appears to be no
scarring and no identifying marks.

29:57.928 --> 30:02.898
The circumference of the head
is 64 centimeters.

30:02.933 --> 30:07.402
There are four digits on each
hand and three on each foot.

30:07.437 --> 30:11.389
The sex is indeterminate.

30:11.424 --> 30:16.211
The eyes are lidless black...

30:16.246 --> 30:18.530
covered by what appears
to be a thin membrane,

30:18.565 --> 30:22.951
which i am now removing.

30:22.986 --> 30:26.721
The tissue underneath...

30:26.756 --> 30:29.891
seems to be semigelatinous...

30:29.926 --> 30:33.077
with a fine network of veins
running throughout.

30:59.454 --> 31:02.457
Examination of the chest
cavity confirms the presence...

31:02.492 --> 31:07.462
of what appears to be
a cardiopulmonary system...

31:07.497 --> 31:11.466
heart, lungs,
all identifiable...

31:11.501 --> 31:15.970
within a mass of white
stringlike tissue...

31:16.005 --> 31:19.257
that doesn't appear
to correspond...

31:19.292 --> 31:21.242
to human physiology.

32:18.066 --> 32:22.804
Stop! Federal agent!
Hold it!

32:31.362 --> 32:33.598
Michael kritschgau!

32:35.083 --> 32:37.902
You are under arrest!

32:40.188 --> 32:42.156
Identify your location!

33:07.248 --> 33:10.601
Get out of the car! Now!

33:13.738 --> 33:15.807
Move!

33:25.283 --> 33:28.786
Please don't shoot. I didn't
mean to hurt you. I had no choice.

33:28.821 --> 33:32.206
Hands on the car! If you
arrest me, they'll kill me.

33:32.241 --> 33:33.608
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:33.643 --> 33:37.245
The same people
who are trying to kill you.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.180
The people who gave you
your cancer.

33:53.711 --> 33:57.598
There's tissue culturing to be
done, dna sequence and an analysis.

33:57.633 --> 34:01.436
We'd be wise to run a gas chromatograph
and that carbon dating you suggested.

34:01.471 --> 34:04.789
But if this isn't alien,
i don't know what it is.

34:08.728 --> 34:10.445
Mulder.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.797
I had reached agent mulder
in a warehouse...

34:12.831 --> 34:15.800
just outside of washington
in sethburg, virginia.

34:16.300 --> 34:19.303
They had managed the frozen
corpse by helicopter...

34:19.804 --> 34:21.304
down the side
of the mountain...

34:21.806 --> 34:25.810
and across the canadian
border in a refrigerated truck.

34:26.310 --> 34:29.813
After conducting a limited
physical examination,

34:29.849 --> 34:32.315
agent mulder
was ready to believe...

34:32.817 --> 34:37.822
that the body was that of an
extraterrestrial biological entity,

34:37.857 --> 34:40.608
that he had finally found the
proof which had eluded him,

34:40.643 --> 34:44.978
which would confirm not only
the existence of alien life,

34:45.014 --> 34:47.732
but of his sister
samantha's abduction.

34:47.766 --> 34:51.786
But this man kritschgau had
convinced you otherwise. How?

34:51.821 --> 34:55.389
He told me a story,
which detailed point by point...

34:55.424 --> 35:00.394
the systematic way in which agent
mulder had been deceived and used,

35:00.429 --> 35:05.600
and how i, as his partner,
had been led down the same path,

35:05.635 --> 35:09.437
losing a family member
due to my allegiance...

35:09.472 --> 35:13.941
and contracting a fatal disease, which
i was being told was engineered...

35:13.976 --> 35:18.196
by the men who are responsible
for agent mulder's deception.

35:18.231 --> 35:20.248
Were you able to convince
agent mulder of these facts?

35:20.283 --> 35:23.284
I was only able
to convince him to meet me...

35:23.319 --> 35:26.287
so that he might
hear the story the way i had.

36:07.095 --> 36:11.633
- Who the hell is this?
- Right there, pork.

36:14.219 --> 36:16.938
How's the wound?

36:16.973 --> 36:19.090
I'll live.

36:20.692 --> 36:23.078
What is this,
babcock?

36:25.630 --> 36:27.766
Get the door.

36:45.817 --> 36:48.803
Where did mulder go?

36:48.838 --> 36:51.339
He got a call.
Is he a believer?

36:51.374 --> 36:53.691
Oh, yeah.

36:53.726 --> 36:57.095
- Then we're the only ones who know.
- Right.

37:00.415 --> 37:02.851
The lie you believe...

37:02.886 --> 37:07.355
that they have cleverly led you
to believe, agent mulder...

37:07.390 --> 37:10.859
is that there's intelligent
life other than our own...

37:11.359 --> 37:13.611
and that we have had contact
with these life-forms.

37:13.646 --> 37:17.649
So you're saying this has
all been orchestrated, a hoax?

37:17.684 --> 37:21.953
Which you have been used to perpetuate.
You come by this knowledge how?

37:24.172 --> 37:27.142
Working for the d.o.d.

37:28.643 --> 37:31.146
Watching a military
industrial complex...

37:31.646 --> 37:34.399
that operated unbridled and
unchecked during the cold war...

37:34.434 --> 37:38.920
create a diversion of attention from
itself and its continued misdeeds...

37:38.955 --> 37:41.890
by confabulating enough
believable evidence...

37:41.925 --> 37:47.228
to convince passionate adepts like
yourself that it really could be true.

37:47.263 --> 37:50.398
And just by chance,
you run into agent scully?

37:55.438 --> 37:57.906
I was just like you,
agent mulder:

37:57.941 --> 38:00.241
Suspicious of everything
but what you should be.

38:01.976 --> 38:06.431
I ran the d.o.d.'s
agitprop arm for a decade.

38:06.466 --> 38:08.433
I can show you records
of disinformation...

38:08.933 --> 38:11.686
dating back to the korean
war, before you were born.

38:11.721 --> 38:13.955
Why come to me now?
Why not four years ago?

38:16.925 --> 38:19.928
I have a son who's very sick.

38:19.963 --> 38:22.297
He served in the gulf war.

38:27.819 --> 38:30.321
The lies are so deep,

38:30.356 --> 38:32.323
the only way to cover them...

38:32.358 --> 38:35.076
is to create something
even more incredible.

38:36.311 --> 38:38.613
They invented you:

38:38.648 --> 38:42.534
Your regression hypnosis, the
story of your sister's abduction,

38:43.034 --> 38:44.536
the lies
they fed your father.

38:45.036 --> 38:48.673
You wanted to believe so badly,
and who could have blamed you?

38:48.708 --> 38:50.959
And the thousands
of u.f.o. Sightings?

38:50.994 --> 38:54.312
Above-top-secret
military aircraft...

38:54.347 --> 38:56.648
concept designed
to feed hysteria.

38:56.683 --> 38:58.366
Evidence of alien biology?

38:58.401 --> 39:02.237
Unclassified but naturally
occurring biologic anomalies...

39:02.737 --> 39:04.239
science will eventually explain.

39:04.274 --> 39:07.091
The body that was found?
Meticulously constructed...

39:07.126 --> 39:09.227
out of biomaterials...

39:09.262 --> 39:13.231
created through the hybridization
of differentiated cells...

39:13.266 --> 39:15.149
what are called chimeras...

39:15.184 --> 39:17.418
frozen into place over
the course of a year...

39:17.453 --> 39:21.506
using sediment and materials
that would bear out its age,

39:21.541 --> 39:24.792
poured through a small channel
drilled in the rock above.

39:24.827 --> 39:28.730
They would have known the body would be
carbon-dated, that it would be proved a fake.

39:28.765 --> 39:32.100
- The body will never be tested.
- What do you mean?

39:32.135 --> 39:34.452
You were only meant to see it...

39:34.487 --> 39:36.788
to make you believe the lie...

39:36.823 --> 39:39.641
so that you might
finally commit...

39:39.676 --> 39:41.609
and go public with the news.

39:44.579 --> 39:46.080
This man is a liar.

39:49.450 --> 39:52.103
You can see for yourself,
agent mulder.

39:52.138 --> 39:54.389
The body is already long gone.

40:12.039 --> 40:15.309
Dr. Arlinski?

40:19.463 --> 40:21.215
It's gone.

40:23.834 --> 40:25.586
Mulder?

40:27.271 --> 40:29.690
What?

40:30.858 --> 40:34.178
It's arlinski.
He's dead.

40:38.182 --> 40:39.166
So is this man.

40:43.704 --> 40:47.691
Who did this, mulder?

40:47.726 --> 40:49.693
Mulder?

40:49.728 --> 40:52.196
What we had here was proof. There's
no way it could be anything else.

40:52.231 --> 40:55.699
You said it yourself:
More tests needed to be run.

40:55.734 --> 40:57.601
But the ice core samples
checked out.

40:58.102 --> 41:00.604
If the ice hasn't been tampered with,
how could the body within be a fake?

41:00.639 --> 41:03.073
Cellular material found
in the ice core samples...

41:03.108 --> 41:06.577
were a direct match for what
this man kritschgau described:

41:06.612 --> 41:09.296
Hybrid cells, chimeras
within the matrix.

41:09.797 --> 41:12.299
Do we know for sure those cells
are not extraterrestrial?

41:12.334 --> 41:15.803
Mulder, everything this man described...
you can't just guess at these details.

41:15.838 --> 41:20.040
I'm sorry, but the facts here completely
overwhelm any argument against them.

41:20.075 --> 41:22.927
Facts overwhelmed by the lies
created to support them.

41:23.344 --> 41:26.247
The only lie here is the one
that you continue to believe.

41:26.282 --> 41:29.583
After all i've seen
and experienced,

41:29.618 --> 41:32.586
i refuse to believe
that it's not true.

41:32.621 --> 41:37.274
Because it's easier
to believe the lie, isn't it?

41:37.309 --> 41:41.562
What the hell did that guy say
to you that you believe his story?

41:43.914 --> 41:47.418
He said that the men
behind this hoax...

41:47.453 --> 41:49.920
behind these lies...

41:49.955 --> 41:53.757
gave me this disease
to make you believe.

42:09.056 --> 42:12.876
What we generally mean
is intelligent life,

42:12.911 --> 42:15.879
something resembling
our noble selves.

42:15.914 --> 42:18.382
It is highly probable...

42:18.417 --> 42:21.385
that there are such
intelligent forms of life...

42:21.420 --> 42:23.887
in other galaxies
in the universe,

42:24.388 --> 42:26.390
and it is even more probable...

42:26.890 --> 42:29.893
that many of these forms are
vastly more intelligent than we.

42:29.928 --> 42:33.330
I think there's no question...

42:33.365 --> 42:36.834
but that we live
in an inhabited universe...

42:36.869 --> 42:40.204
that has life all over it.

42:40.239 --> 42:42.623
By finding out what the other
planets are like,

42:42.658 --> 42:47.494
by finding out whether there are
civilizations on planets of other stars,

42:47.529 --> 42:52.950
we reestablish a meaningful
context for ourselves.

42:52.985 --> 42:57.421
I don't think we should wait
until the encounter occurs,

42:57.456 --> 43:01.925
but that we should do all in our
power to prepare ourselves for it.

43:01.960 --> 43:07.398
I can conceive of no nightmare
as terrifying...

43:07.433 --> 43:10.768
as establishing
such communication...

43:10.803 --> 43:12.870
with a so-called
superior...

43:12.905 --> 43:16.290
or, if you wish, advanced
technology in outer space.

43:21.862 --> 43:25.866
Early this morning...
i got a call from the police,

43:25.901 --> 43:29.370
asking me to come
to agent mulder's apartment.

43:30.871 --> 43:33.374
The detective asked me...

43:35.376 --> 43:38.879
he needed me to identify a body.

43:38.914 --> 43:41.999
Agent scully...

43:51.191 --> 43:54.194
agent mulder died
late last night...

43:54.229 --> 43:58.699
from an apparent self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.

44:37.738 --> 44:40.708
I made this!

44:41.305 --> 44:47.271
