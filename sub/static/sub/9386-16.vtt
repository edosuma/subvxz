WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:05.255
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.339 --> 00:08.091
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.175 --> 00:12.095
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.179 --> 00:14.806
On which we used to rely?

00:14.890 --> 00:18.101
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:18.185 --> 00:21.480
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.563 --> 00:23.190
All the things
that make us

00:23.273 --> 00:24.858
Laugh and cry

00:24.942 --> 00:30.030
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:34.952 --> 00:37.704
I am so bored.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.958
Hey, dog, when you take
a break from re-applying your lipstick,

00:41.083 --> 00:42.292
how about taking me
to the park?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.836
My lipstick? What?

00:43.919 --> 00:45.003
(chuckling)
Oh.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.715
Oh, right, right.
Right, because of my penis.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.802
Yeah, that's--that's--
that's fantastic.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.596
Lois, Brian won't
take me to the park.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.140
Then he talked about
his ding-dong.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.810
Lois. Lois!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.436
Damn it, woman!
Pay attention to me!

01:01.520 --> 01:04.189
Ow! Stewie, that's
not nice.

01:04.273 --> 01:06.024
Don't grab Mommy's
pants like that.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.401
You could really hurt her.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.528
Yes. Yes, I could,
couldn't I?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.655
I could hurt Mommy.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.491
Shame on us, Rupert.
How dare we succumb to boredom

01:14.575 --> 01:16.869
while that wretched woman
continues to breathe?

01:16.952 --> 01:19.705
She must be destroyed.
With Lois out of the way,

01:19.788 --> 01:21.582
I could finally focus
on my life's ambition

01:21.665 --> 01:23.625
of taking pictures
of Madison County.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.253
(sighs)

01:26.336 --> 01:27.796
Let's go back
and take a bath.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.090
Yeah. How about you go back
and take a bath?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.597
Griffin, have you filed
those shipping reports yet?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.515
Angela, Angela, come here.
Check this out.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.059
Look at what
this chick is doing to this polar bear.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.353
Wait, wait, it-- it's, uh...

01:43.437 --> 01:46.190
Wait, wait, wait.
It's-- It's coming up.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.233
(exclaims)

01:48.317 --> 01:49.526
(chuckling)

01:49.610 --> 01:50.903
Oh, there you are, Opie.

01:50.986 --> 01:54.156
Congratulations.
You made Employee of the Month again.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.450
(babbling nonsense)

01:56.533 --> 01:58.535
How come I'm never
Employee of the Month?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.037
Man, this is
the worst job I've had

02:00.120 --> 02:02.873
since I was the conductor
for the Sand People choir.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.208
And a one and a two.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.627
(all gibbering)

02:07.920 --> 02:11.423
No, no, no, no, no!
The altos were early.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.217
Oh, this is the worst
glee club I've ever...

02:13.300 --> 02:15.177
Oh. Oh, come on.
Where are you going?

02:15.260 --> 02:17.387
-The benefit's tomorrow!
-Relax.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.890
The Sand People frighten
easily but they'll be back.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.225
And in greater numbers.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.601
Well, that'll give us
a richer harmony.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.770
Oh, yeah.
No, it's gonna sound fantastic.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.153
(whirring)

02:36.740 --> 02:39.201
Ah! Help! Somebody!
I'm blacking out.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.370
(screaming)

02:41.453 --> 02:42.746
Brian, help me.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.791
(screaming)

02:50.420 --> 02:51.505
(pinging)

02:55.843 --> 02:58.428
That jerk, Opie, got
Employee of the Month again.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.805
All because my boss hates me.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.100
Maybe you need
to brown-nose her a little bit, Peter.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.227
Really? I thought you said
she was ugly.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.979
Oh, oh, oh,
you mean kiss up to her.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.397
That's a great idea, Joe.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.773
And if that doesn't do it,

03:09.857 --> 03:12.693
you could always just
work hard and be polite.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.612
That's how I won friends
when I worked for E!

03:15.696 --> 03:19.700
Seabiscuit! Seabiscuit!
Would you mind talking to E!?

03:19.783 --> 03:22.578
I'm not Seabiscuit.
I'm Penelope Cruz.

03:22.661 --> 03:26.582
And you're just lovely.
Would you like a carrot?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.293
(munching)

03:29.376 --> 03:31.086
Good girl.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.754
Brown-nose, huh?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.965
All right. I'll do
something special for her.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.471
Surprise!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.807
Griffin, what the hell
are you doing at my house?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.685
Well, I asked around the office
and everybody said you liked animals,

03:46.768 --> 03:49.104
so I organized
a surprise cockfight.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.189
Ta-da!

03:50.272 --> 03:53.108
-(gasping)
-Oh. Oh, boy.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.361
Oh, boy. Oh, God. Uh...

03:56.445 --> 04:00.240
Well, looks like
they killed each other.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.701
That's probably what all that racket
was about an hour ago.

04:02.784 --> 04:07.080
Um, well, I will
see you Monday.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.547
(glass shattering)

04:16.256 --> 04:18.717
Ah, crap.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.138
Well, looks like the good Lord
just sent me a conversation starter.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.724
Come here, Jesse.
Come get the ball.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.526
(both groaning)

04:40.948 --> 04:43.075
BOTH:
Down by the shores of the hanky-panky

04:43.158 --> 04:45.869
Where the bullfrogs leap
from bank to banky

04:45.953 --> 04:47.162
(screams, thuds)

04:47.246 --> 04:49.289
(chuckling)
How unfortunate.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.751
Miss Hobson, Stewie's
really been acting out a lot at home.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.963
And I was just wondering,
how's he been behaving at school?

04:56.046 --> 05:00.092
Hmm. Mrs. Griffin, let me
show you some pictures he drew in class.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.517
-Notice anything unusual?
-I sure do.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.061
-His father's not in any of them.
-Exactly.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.648
Well, Peter's been
very preoccupied with work lately.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.859
I guess Stewie's been
missing his father.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.652
Thank you for letting me know.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.571
-(crossbow firing)
-(groans)

05:20.654 --> 05:21.947
Damn! She moved.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.782
Well, I suppose
it's not the first time

05:23.866 --> 05:25.617
someone's made
a miscalculation.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.953
(zooming)

05:29.872 --> 05:31.540
What happens to us
in the future, Doc?

05:31.623 --> 05:34.585
It's your kids, Marty.
Something's gotta be done about your kids.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.212
-What do you mean?
-Your daughter marries a black man.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.257
That-That's actually not
a big deal for me.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.134
Yeah, me neither.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.928
Well, it...
Well, it... You... Really?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.514
Yeah. I mean, w-what's--
what's wrong with that?

05:47.598 --> 05:48.932
Oh, no, no, nothing,
nothing.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.560
It's nothing, I guess.
I think-- I think it's great.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.270
Congratulations.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.480
I don't think I'm comfortable
around you anymore.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.982
Did you know peanut butter
was invented

05:57.065 --> 05:58.901
-by a black man?
-Too late, Doc.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.696
(doorbell rings)

06:03.530 --> 06:05.991
Oh, hi, Herbert.
What brings you here?

06:06.074 --> 06:10.204
It seems your son's baseball
broke one of my windows the other day.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.873
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.209
Chris, this is gonna come out
of your allowance.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.293
Oh...

06:16.376 --> 06:18.420
Perhaps we could
work something out.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.380
I could use
a strapping young man

06:20.464 --> 06:22.508
to do some chores
around my house.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.884
That seems fair to me.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.345
Chris, you have damaged
this man's property.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.763
And until you pay off
the debt,

06:27.846 --> 06:29.681
you'll do whatever job
he wants you to do.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.600
And at the end of the day,
if you're exhausted

06:31.683 --> 06:32.851
and your face is
dripping wet,

06:32.935 --> 06:34.686
well, that just means
you did a good job.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.855
That sounds fine.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.650
I don't want to spend
my weekend doing chores.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.069
You know, Chris,
a little hard work can do wonders.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.862
Just look at how
they built the pyramids.

06:43.946 --> 06:47.074
They say all peoples
must go through some hard times.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.493
Well, we Jews are getting
ours out of the way early.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.205
From here on out,
it's gonna be nothing but smooth sailing.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.084
I have an announcement
to make.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.045
Don't you do it.
Don't you lose a single pound.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.381
I don't care what
those Hollywood image-makers say.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.632
Big women are sexy.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.008
(sighs)
I wanted to tell you

07:05.092 --> 07:07.803
that Opie will
not be receiving Employee of the Month,

07:07.886 --> 07:09.680
because he's being promoted!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.890
Oh, yes! That means
I'm Employee of the Month.

07:11.974 --> 07:15.310
No, you're not, Griffin.
I'm giving it to Soundwave.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.729
So, I can just put
my stuff anywhere?

07:21.233 --> 07:24.319
My wife, Denise.
We met in a Christian chat room.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.824
Peter, we need
to talk about your son.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.409
The fat one
or the funny-looking one?

07:30.492 --> 07:34.037
Ha ha ha!
Dad called you fat.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.122
Wait.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.915
Stewie's really been
acting out lately.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.668
And, I think it's 'cause
he's not spending enough time with you.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.879
It's time that you take
an interest in your son.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.007
Starting today,
I want you to spend more time with Stewie.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.550
Uh... okay.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.260
You can make a box fort.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.929
See? Here's a box.
You can pretend it's a fort.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.307
Actually, that sounds
like fun. I want this.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.184
I'm king in here.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.395
Peter, maybe Stewie
would like to play fort, too.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.771
No!

07:59.855 --> 08:01.565
If you need me,
I'll be in space.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.532
Great idea bringing Stewie
to Fenway Park, Peter.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.826
Yeah. There's no better place
for a father and son

08:12.910 --> 08:15.287
to really get
to know each other than a ball game.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.580
Uh, where is Stewie?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.873
(panting)

08:19.708 --> 08:21.460
(gasping)
Is that a baby in there?

08:21.543 --> 08:24.296
Oh, my God!
He's gonna miss the game.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.131
(electrical buzzing)

08:26.215 --> 08:28.717
Hey, you guys.
You remember those hot homeless twins

08:28.800 --> 08:30.802
who live under the overpass?
Well, last night I--

08:30.886 --> 08:33.305
Wait, wait, wait, Quagmire.
Let me cover Stewie's ears.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.890
(silence)

08:47.277 --> 08:49.821
And this is the hand
that caused all the trouble.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.032
(laughs)
Got your nose, little guy.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.951
(screaming)

08:56.870 --> 08:59.540
Peter, did you take
Stewie to a strip club?

08:59.623 --> 09:01.166
He smells like
sweat and fear.

09:01.250 --> 09:05.212
Let me tell you, Tuesday afternoon
is not exactly their "A" squad.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.839
I actually saw bullet wounds.

09:06.922 --> 09:10.092
You can't just take him places
you want to go. He's a baby.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.679
Look, Lois, I think I know how
to spend time with my own kid, all right?

09:13.762 --> 09:16.139
The bond between
a father and son is sacred.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.019
I'm sorry, Jesus.
But my house, my rules.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.981
Up yours, Joseph.
You're not my real dad.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.941
(beeping)

09:26.024 --> 09:27.109
(ringing)

09:27.192 --> 09:29.194
-Hello?
-Hey, Dad, it's me.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.822
Listen, things here
aren't working out anymore.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.532
And I was just--
I was wondering,

09:33.615 --> 09:35.951
can-- can I come live
with you and Janet for a while?

09:36.034 --> 09:38.871
Oh, wow, kiddo.
You know, I'd love that,

09:38.954 --> 09:42.541
but I don't know if now is the best time.
Maybe next year, okay?

09:42.624 --> 09:43.792
I'll see you Friday night.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.377
Tell your mother
I sent the check.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.296
So, where were we?

09:47.379 --> 09:48.881
Right about here.

09:48.964 --> 09:53.051
-Ah, come on, baby, it's my birthday.
-No.

09:53.135 --> 09:56.221
All I'm saying is
that you just need to find an activity

09:56.305 --> 09:58.390
that you and Stewie can share.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.268
Peter, can you reach
that box of rice?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.145
-Ow!
-Oh, sorry, Lois.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.521
(laughing)

10:04.605 --> 10:06.773
Oh, oh, that rice
got you, bitch.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.067
Hey, Stewie's laughing.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.736
Hey, you think that's funny?
Hey, you like that?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.988
Hey, hey, Lois, you want
some beans with that rice?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.072
Ow!

10:14.990 --> 10:16.909
Oh! Oh, I misjudged you,
fat man.

10:16.992 --> 10:18.577
Damn it. Peter,
what's wrong with you?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.871
Wait, wait, wait, Lois, Lois, don't move.
Stewie's loving this.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.415
(smashing)
(laughs)

10:23.498 --> 10:25.125
See if she's got
any cash on her.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.462
(chortling)

10:28.545 --> 10:30.756
Okay, Stewie,
get the camera ready.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.009
(shouting)

10:34.092 --> 10:35.385
Peter, stop it!

10:35.469 --> 10:37.137
What the hell
are you doing?

10:37.221 --> 10:40.057
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm bonding with Stewie.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.183
(both laughing)

10:47.356 --> 10:51.151
Oh, there is nothing more precious
than a baby's laughter.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.654
(Peter laughs)

10:53.737 --> 10:55.280
(tires screeching)

10:55.364 --> 10:58.325
(both laughing
uncontrollably)

11:07.501 --> 11:09.378
(splashing)

11:09.461 --> 11:11.880
(continuing to laugh
uncontrollably)

11:29.314 --> 11:32.234
(laughter calming down)

11:38.198 --> 11:39.241
(both sigh)

11:39.950 --> 11:41.243
Jeez, I hope
she can get out.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.870
Oh, I'm sure
she'll be fine.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.289
(doorbell ringing)

11:45.372 --> 11:46.832
Well, hello there, young man.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.501
I was starting to think
you weren't coming.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.628
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Herbert.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.338
Well, I guess
I'll get started.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.508
You know, if you get
sweaty and want to take your shirt off,

11:56.592 --> 11:57.885
that'd be just fine.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.345
Or tie it in a knot,
your choice.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.310
We now go live
to Ollie Williams

12:06.393 --> 12:08.103
in the Channel Five
traffic copter.

12:08.187 --> 12:10.230
-What's the scene, Ollie?
-Everybody looks like ants!

12:10.314 --> 12:11.690
Probably because
you're up so high.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.902
Coming up next,
an exclusive interview with Andrew Shue.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.905
Hey, hey, Dad, Dad,
pull my finger.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.239
Wait... (farts)

12:19.323 --> 12:22.326
Sounded like a peep toad.
But it's not summer.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.369
(breathing hard)

12:24.453 --> 12:27.247
Hey, drippy. You're back.
What's for dinner?

12:27.331 --> 12:29.875
Peter, when I said,
"Bond with Stewie,"

12:29.958 --> 12:31.668
this is not
what I had in mind!

12:31.752 --> 12:33.295
I am furious with you!

12:33.378 --> 12:35.422
You can't talk
to him like that.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.049
(grunting)

12:37.132 --> 12:38.759
Take that!

12:38.842 --> 12:40.135
Stewie, you're going
to your room.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.095
I think not,
Dad's got my back.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.765
Eh, Stewie, she looks mad.
You better go to your room.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.683
What? What's the matter
with you, fat man?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.268
Stop her.
Help me, you fool.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.605
You traitor.
I trusted you, but you're a wuss!

12:51.688 --> 12:53.565
Oh, don't feel bad, Peter.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.192
Hey, I know
what'll cheer you up.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.902
No, I don't think
I'm in the mood.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.946
Are you sure?

12:59.029 --> 13:00.781
It's peanut butter
jelly time

13:00.864 --> 13:02.115
Peanut butter jelly time

13:02.199 --> 13:03.784
Peanut butter
jelly time

13:03.867 --> 13:05.619
Where ya at? Where ya at?

13:05.702 --> 13:06.954
Where ya at?
Where ya at?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.705
Now there you go,
there you go

13:08.789 --> 13:09.998
There you go,
there you go

13:10.082 --> 13:11.625
Peanut butter jelly

13:11.708 --> 13:13.377
Peanut butter
jelly

13:13.460 --> 13:14.795
Peanut butter jelly

13:14.878 --> 13:16.171
Peanut butter
jelly

13:16.255 --> 13:19.216
Sorry, Brian.
It's just not doing it today.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.176
Do the peanut butter jelly,
peanut butter jelly

13:21.260 --> 13:22.803
Peanut butter jelly
with a baseball bat

13:22.886 --> 13:24.137
Peanut butter jelly,
peanut butter jelly

13:24.221 --> 13:26.098
Peanut butter jelly
with a baseball bat

13:35.065 --> 13:37.818
PETER: Hey, Stewie.
You got a minute for your daddy?

13:37.901 --> 13:39.444
Get out of here,
you spineless oaf!

13:39.528 --> 13:42.364
Oh, and by the way,
I faked all those bowel movements.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.575
Brian, I feel awful.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.286
Stewie and I were
getting along so good and now he hates me.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.663
-How do I get him to like me again?
-Well, that depends.

13:49.746 --> 13:53.292
Do you really want my advice or are you
just asking random questions again?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.585
What's a hypotenuse?

13:56.628 --> 13:58.630
Stewie, I know you're
a little mad at me right now.

13:58.714 --> 14:01.592
But, when you see where I'm taking you,
you're gonna change your mind.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.510
Oh, yeah, right.
I'm gonna change my mind.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.930
We just sat on a plane
for three hours to come to Florida,

14:07.014 --> 14:08.348
God's waiting room,

14:08.432 --> 14:09.892
for who knows what...

14:11.393 --> 14:13.645
Oh, Disney World!
Disney World! Disney World!

14:13.729 --> 14:15.272
Oh! Oh!
I want to go to Disney World!

14:15.355 --> 14:17.900
Oh! Oh! Disney World!
Disney World! Oh! Oh! Oh!

14:18.942 --> 14:20.444
I'm still mad at you.

14:23.530 --> 14:28.160
(kids shout)

14:28.243 --> 14:31.371
Hey, check it out, Stewie.
Halle Berry's Wild Ride.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.415
(all exclaiming)

14:34.458 --> 14:35.792
(running footsteps)

14:35.876 --> 14:38.629
('80s pop music playing)

14:42.174 --> 14:45.886
Wow! It looks like
Michael Jackson's coming right at me.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.723
I say, we've
been puttering around

14:49.806 --> 14:51.016
this fat farm for hours.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.309
I've had enough.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.728
Hey, Stewie,
they got-- Stewie?

14:54.811 --> 14:56.146
Oh, my God, he's gone.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.440
Has anyone seen
my son? Hello?

14:58.524 --> 15:00.234
Hey, it's the crows
from Dumbo.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.527
Hey, you guys seen my son?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.612
Well, I done seen
about everything

15:03.695 --> 15:06.532
but I sure enough
ain't seen your boy, no how!

15:06.615 --> 15:09.660
Ah, that's good old-fashioned
family racism.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.293
Well, well,
a lost child.

15:18.377 --> 15:21.088
Looks like we've got
a new recruit.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.464
(Stewie exclaiming)

15:23.757 --> 15:24.758
Now sing.

15:24.842 --> 15:25.968
I shall do no such thing.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.052
You must sing.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.762
If you don't,
they'll make you do

15:28.846 --> 15:31.056
a Christmas movie
with Tim Allen.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.226
It's a tiny, tiny world

15:34.309 --> 15:37.604
It's a tiny,
tiny world

15:39.314 --> 15:42.192
Is Chris still doing chores
for that disgusting old man?

15:42.276 --> 15:43.819
Meg, that's not nice.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.196
Old people have
a lot to offer society.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.573
Just look at Kim Cattrall.

15:47.656 --> 15:50.742
(moaning)
Come and get it, big boy.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.119
(metallic creaking)

15:52.202 --> 15:53.370
Oh, damn.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.917
There we go.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.043
(shatters)

16:00.127 --> 16:02.754
(jazz music playing)

16:04.673 --> 16:06.758
Thanks for buying
me dinner, Mr. Herbert.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.053
Oh, I wanted to thank you properly
for all your hard work.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.638
Souvenir photograph?

16:11.722 --> 16:12.806
Hell, yes.

16:15.851 --> 16:18.770
(soft rock music playing)

16:27.446 --> 16:31.491
-HERBERT: He rakes
-and trims the grass

16:31.575 --> 16:35.370
He loves to mow and weed

16:35.454 --> 16:39.082
I cook like Betty Crocker

16:39.166 --> 16:43.420
And I look like Donna Reed

16:43.504 --> 16:47.591
There's plastic
on the furniture

16:47.674 --> 16:51.553
To keep it neat and clean

16:51.637 --> 16:54.640
In the Pine-Sol
scented air

16:54.723 --> 16:58.894
Somewhere that's green

17:00.020 --> 17:03.106
Between our frozen dinners

17:03.190 --> 17:07.277
And our bedtime, 9:15

17:07.361 --> 17:10.822
We snuggle watching Lucy

17:10.906 --> 17:13.992
-(no discernible dialog)
-On a big, enormous

17:14.076 --> 17:18.413
12-inch screen

17:18.497 --> 17:21.834
I'm his

17:21.917 --> 17:24.294
December bride

17:25.337 --> 17:29.800
Chris Griffin,
he knows best

17:30.551 --> 17:34.680
The kids play Howdy Doody

17:34.763 --> 17:39.935
As the sun sets
in the west

17:40.018 --> 17:42.437
A picture out of

17:42.521 --> 17:47.359
Better Homes and Gardens

17:47.442 --> 17:52.406
Magazine

17:54.032 --> 17:58.328
Someday I know

18:00.163 --> 18:04.418
We, too, will go

18:07.004 --> 18:11.383
Somewhere that's

18:12.176 --> 18:18.765
Green

18:22.102 --> 18:24.980
(snoring)

18:25.063 --> 18:26.231
Are you dead?

18:26.315 --> 18:27.691
(music playing)

18:27.774 --> 18:31.236
It's a tiny,
tiny world

18:31.320 --> 18:34.448
It's a tiny, tiny world

18:34.531 --> 18:37.993
It's a tiny,
tiny world

18:38.076 --> 18:41.538
It's a tiny, tiny world

18:41.622 --> 18:43.665
I say, fat man!
Get me out of here!

18:43.749 --> 18:46.043
Oh, Stewie, there you are.
Thank God.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.711
Why are you dressed
like Rerun?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.379
(all cheering)

18:50.464 --> 18:51.840
You're free, children.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.760
Run back to
your individual countries of origin.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.094
GUARD: Hey!

18:56.178 --> 18:59.139
Those multi-cultural slave children
belong to the Disney Corporation!

18:59.223 --> 19:00.641
Get 'em, Achmed.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.101
Uh... uh...

19:03.185 --> 19:05.312
hey, look over there.
There's a woman learning.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.615
Quick, in here.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.455
(hissing)

19:24.081 --> 19:25.290
(zings)

19:36.176 --> 19:38.345
(wheels squealing)

19:45.644 --> 19:46.687
(exclaiming)

19:51.984 --> 19:52.985
(panting)

19:53.068 --> 19:54.278
Looks like we're
in the clear.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.154
(gasps)
Michael Eisner.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.239
Cover your heart!

19:57.364 --> 19:59.741
Kali Maa!

19:59.825 --> 20:01.910
Kali Maa!

20:01.994 --> 20:04.830
Kali Maa!

20:04.913 --> 20:06.665
You betrayed
the shareholders.

20:06.748 --> 20:07.791
(groaning)

20:07.875 --> 20:08.876
(screaming)

20:16.800 --> 20:17.801
You think he's dead?

20:17.885 --> 20:19.636
No, no. He'll be back
on his feet in no time,

20:19.720 --> 20:21.638
probably follow
in Jonathan Dolgen's footsteps,

20:21.722 --> 20:23.599
wind up with a pod deal
over at Touchstone.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.309
-You all right, Stewie?
-(sighing)

20:25.392 --> 20:26.643
You know what, fat man?

20:26.727 --> 20:29.021
I'm not sure how to say this
without sounding cheesy,

20:29.104 --> 20:31.982
but, uh, well, you really
came through for me today.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.234
So I-- I--

20:34.318 --> 20:35.485
Oh, what the hell.

20:35.569 --> 20:38.030
Oh, I love you, too, buddy.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.532
Come on, Stewie.
Let's go home.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.659
STEWIE:
Hmm, Florida. Just think,

20:42.743 --> 20:44.703
somewhere in
this state right now,

20:44.786 --> 20:47.456
Jeb Bush is eating
a live puppy.

20:49.333 --> 20:53.921
Well, Jesse, I guess we got to find
some other way to spend our evenings.

20:54.004 --> 20:57.299
MALE TV ANNOUNCER:
And now back to ESPN's exclusive coverage

20:57.382 --> 20:59.092
of the Little League
World Series.

20:59.176 --> 21:01.261
Oh, jackpot!

21:05.557 --> 21:07.559
(theme music playing)
