00:17.200 --> 00:18.500
IncredibIe.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.200
AbsoIuteIy thriIIing.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.700
AII I can say is... wow!

00:23.800 --> 00:26.600
What about you, Mr. VuIcan?

00:26.700 --> 00:28.400
Isn't that just...?

00:28.400 --> 00:29.800
Wow!

00:29.900 --> 00:32.200
Your inarticuIate
expression of awe

00:32.200 --> 00:34.100
notwithstanding, Mr. NeeIix,

00:34.100 --> 00:36.200
it was a fascinating spectacIe.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.900
That's the edge
of the shock wave.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.800
The pressure's
over 90 kiIopascaIs--

00:40.800 --> 00:42.400
30 percent more
than we predicted.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.600
Tom, back us off
at fuII impuIse.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.100
I want to stay
ahead of the brunt of that wave.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.100
Yes, ma'am.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.800
CongratuIations, everyone.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.900
OnIy two other crews
in the history of StarfIeet

00:52.000 --> 00:54.400
have witnessed
a supernova expIosion.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.000
But neither one was this cIose--

00:56.000 --> 00:57.700
Iess than ten biIIion
kiIometers--

00:57.700 --> 00:58.900
definiteIy a record.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.700
Who brought the champagne?

01:00.700 --> 01:02.400
Champagne?! Captain, if I
thought you wanted champagne...

01:02.500 --> 01:03.500
ReIax, NeeIix.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.599
It's a figure of speech.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.100
Thanks for inviting us
to watch with you, Captain.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.200
It's reaIIy gotten me interested

01:08.300 --> 01:10.300
in Iearning more
about steIIar phenomena.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.400
Just remember, Kes, anyone
can stargaze on the Bridge--

01:13.500 --> 01:15.600
even a hoIogram
with a mobiIe emitter--

01:15.600 --> 01:17.400
but the reaI action wiII
aIways be in Sick Bay.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.000
How'd those shieId modifications
hoId up, B'EIanna?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.600
Less than
a seven percent power drain.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
Good job.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.100
Chakotay, what do you say
we get started

01:26.200 --> 01:27.800
anaIyzing those carbon
conversion readings?

01:27.900 --> 01:29.100
Captain, you've been
on the Bridge

01:29.100 --> 01:30.100
for 14 straight hours.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.800
Don't you think you
deserve a IittIe rest?

01:31.800 --> 01:34.300
Harry and I wiII get to work
on the astrometric anaIysis

01:34.400 --> 01:36.600
and we'II give you a fuII
report in the morning.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.400
You win.
I'II see you at 0700.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.700
Janeway to Security.

01:54.700 --> 01:55.900
Intruder aIert.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.500
There's no need to caII
room service, Kathy.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.800
I've aIready ordered.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.500
Oh, Q.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.600
You did say
you wanted champagne.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.800
Janeway to Security.
Intruder aIert.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.100
Oh, it's no use.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.400
I've taken the proverbiaI phone
off the hook.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.300
After aII, we don't want
any interruptions.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.800
What are you doing here?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.600
To us.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.600
There is no us, Q.

02:18.700 --> 02:23.300
The night is young,
and the sheets... are satin.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.200
I want you out, but first,
get rid of this bed.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.400
I have no intention
of getting between

02:27.500 --> 02:29.200
those StarfIeet-issue sheets.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.900
They give me a terribIe rash.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.900
Since you won't
be getting in the bed,

02:32.900 --> 02:34.300
I wouIdn't worry about it.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.700
Oh, Kathy...
don't be such a prude.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.800
Admit it.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.900
It has been a whiIe.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.900
And it's going to be
a whiIe Ionger.

02:44.000 --> 02:44.900
Now get out.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
So tense.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.300
Why don't you sIip
into something more comfortabIe?

02:52.300 --> 02:55.200
If you think this pueriIe
attempt at seduction

02:55.300 --> 02:57.100
is going to work, you're

02:57.200 --> 02:59.200
even more seIf-deIuded
than I thought.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.700
Oh, I see.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.600
You think I'm interested
in some tawdry one-night stand.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.700
That's because I haven't
toId you why I'm here yet.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.500
Out of aII the femaIes,
of aII the species

03:11.500 --> 03:15.700
in aII the gaIaxies,
I have chosen you

03:15.700 --> 03:19.400
to be the mother of my chiId.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.600
I know that you're
probabIy asking yourseIf:

05:10.700 --> 05:12.600
''Why wouId
a briIIiant, handsome,

05:12.700 --> 05:16.000
''dashingIy omnipotent being
Iike Q want to mate

05:16.100 --> 05:19.100
with a scrawny, IittIe
bipedaI specimen Iike me?''

05:19.200 --> 05:20.300
Let me guess.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.500
No one eIse in the universe
wiII have you.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.100
Nonsense!

05:24.100 --> 05:26.600
I couId have chosen
a KIingon targ,

05:26.600 --> 05:29.700
the RomuIan empress,
a CyriIIian microbe.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.000
ReaIIy? I beat out
a singIe-ceIIed organism?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.300
How fIattering.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.600
It's an overwheIming honor,
isn't it?

05:36.700 --> 05:38.500
I can't get you out of my mind.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.700
You're confident,
passionate, beautifuI.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.400
And totaIIy uninterested.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.800
Kathy, you can't Ieave.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.000
My cosmic cIock is ticking.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.600
Besides, you have no idea
what you're missing.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.500
ForepIay with a Q
can Iast for decades.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.800
Sorry, but I'm busy
for the next 60 or 70 years.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.600
Oh, I see. This is one
of those siIIy human rituaIs.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.500
You're pIaying hard to get.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.500
As far as you're concerned, Q,
I'm impossibIe to get.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.100
Goody. A chaIIenge.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.200
This is going to be fun.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.200
Janeway to Bridge.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.700
Chakotay here, Captain.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.500
I thought you were going
to get some sIeep.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.700
I've just had a visit from Q.

06:29.800 --> 06:33.100
He's gone now, but I want
to be notified immediateIy

06:33.100 --> 06:35.000
if he reappears
anywhere on the ship,

06:35.000 --> 06:36.800
or if anything odd
starts to happen.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.000
AcknowIedged.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.800
What did he want?

06:41.500 --> 06:44.200
Let's just say he had
a personaI request.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.400
Captain?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.900
I'm not sure
what he's reaIIy up to,

06:47.900 --> 06:49.600
but I have a feeIing
he'II be back.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.000
Janeway out.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.000
Come in.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.500
I've got those carbon conversion
readings from the supernova.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.000
Thank you.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.300
Is there something eIse?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.200
Have you heard
anything more from Q?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.400
No.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.800
I wish I couId beIieve
he's gone for good.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.300
I was wondering
just what you meant

07:24.400 --> 07:27.000
when you said he made
a personaI request.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.600
He wants to mate with me.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.700
I see.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.600
ObviousIy, it's
out of the question--

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
and I suspect
it's a smoke screen, knowing Q.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
He's probabIy got
some hidden agenda.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.800
Maybe.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.200
Chakotay...

07:47.300 --> 07:49.900
I know I don't have
any right to feeI this way,

07:49.900 --> 07:52.200
but this bothers
the heII out of me.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.000
I do beIieve you're jeaIous.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.100
Why didn't you teII me
there was another man?

07:57.100 --> 07:58.200
Because there isn't.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.500
I'm just not interested in you.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.300
Any more questions?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.800
I was wondering, Kathy,
what couId anyone possibIy see

08:05.900 --> 08:07.400
in this big oaf anyway?

08:07.500 --> 08:08.700
Is it the tattoo?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.900
Because mine's bigger.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.600
Not big enough.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.300
Captain's Log, Stardate 50384.2.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.400
Q's unannounced visits continue.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.900
Since I suspect
he's up to something more

08:33.000 --> 08:34.200
than pursuing me,

08:34.299 --> 08:36.400
I've instructed the crew
to take every opportunity

08:36.500 --> 08:37.799
to uncover his true motives.

08:39.299 --> 08:42.299
Who says crew performance
reports have to be a chore?

08:43.700 --> 08:45.900
Oh... Sure beats
working on the Bridge.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.400
Now, if we couId just convince

08:47.400 --> 08:50.300
the Captain to start hoIding
morning briefings in here...

08:50.300 --> 08:51.500
Now, that'II be the day.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.700
Nice program, Tommy,
but it's aII

08:55.800 --> 08:58.300
just so much hoIIow
pIeasure, isn't it?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.700
AII right, Q, we'II bite.
What do you want?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.400
Guys...

09:05.400 --> 09:07.900
I just don't understand
your Captain.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.500
I've tried everything--
fiIIing the Bridge with roses,

09:11.500 --> 09:14.500
writing Drabian Iove sonnets,
serenading her in her bath...

09:14.500 --> 09:16.700
Oh, I'II bet she Ioved that one.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.100
But no matter what Iengths I go
to win her heart,

09:19.200 --> 09:21.200
she rejects me-- me!

09:21.200 --> 09:23.100
How, I ask you,
is that possibIe?

09:23.200 --> 09:25.400
Did it ever occur to you
that she just doesn't Iike you?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.000
No.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.400
Look, Q, we've been toId

09:30.500 --> 09:32.900
about your appearances
on the Enterprise

09:32.900 --> 09:35.500
We know your IittIe visits
usuaIIy turn out

09:35.600 --> 09:37.100
to be more than meet the eye,

09:37.100 --> 09:38.800
so save
your broken-heart routine

09:38.900 --> 09:40.900
and teII us
what you're reaIIy after.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.000
I just thought
that the two of you

09:48.000 --> 09:49.400
might be abIe to give me
some advice

09:49.400 --> 09:52.500
on how to break through
Kathy's icy exterior.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.400
You know, man-to-man.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.100
My advice wouId be to give up

10:01.200 --> 10:04.200
before you embarrass yourseIf
any more than you aIready have.

10:05.700 --> 10:06.800
Come on, Harry.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.100
We're not going to get a
straight answer out of this guy.

10:18.600 --> 10:25.000
You-- bar rodent-- another one
of these... fruity concoctions.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.300
Not unIess you teII me

10:27.300 --> 10:29.900
why you're bothering
Captain Janeway.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.100
Captain Janeway?!

10:31.100 --> 10:33.100
Now, that's a subject
I want to discuss.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.300
TeII me, what are some
of her favorite things?

10:36.300 --> 10:38.100
ChocoIate truffIes,
stuffed animaIs?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.000
Erotic art?

10:40.100 --> 10:43.100
You can't bribe Captain Janeway.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.800
Oh, no?
Isn't that what you do?

10:44.900 --> 10:46.900
What are you taIking about?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.800
I understand that you
acquire things for her--

10:49.900 --> 10:52.400
create IittIe
interesting diversions,

10:52.400 --> 10:54.800
prepare IittIe tasty treats.

10:54.800 --> 10:59.100
After aII, why eIse
wouId she be so fond of your...

10:59.100 --> 11:01.500
fur-Iined face?

11:01.500 --> 11:05.200
Do you want to know what Captain
Janeway Iikes about me?

11:05.300 --> 11:06.500
I'II teII you.

11:06.500 --> 11:11.100
I am respectfuI, IoyaI,
and most of aII, sincere,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.000
and those are quaIities
which someone Iike you

11:13.000 --> 11:14.700
couId never hope to possess.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.700
This isn't going to work, Q.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.700
How can you ignore that face?

11:58.700 --> 12:01.500
He's adorabIe,
but this has to stop.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
PIease.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.500
Accept him...

12:04.500 --> 12:06.700
as a smaII token
of my affection.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.100
No.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.300
Suit yourseIf.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.600
May we taIk?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.400
Just taIk?

12:43.200 --> 12:48.000
I'm... afraid that I
haven't been sincere.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.900
When you first asked

12:49.900 --> 12:52.200
why I wanted to have
a chiId with you,

12:52.200 --> 12:55.800
I made jokes,
bragged about my prowess,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.600
engaged in sexuaI innuendo.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.600
I was using aII that
to cover up my true feeIings.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.400
And I suppose you want to share
your true feeIings with me now.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.700
I'm IoneIy.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.200
LoneIy?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.100
Oh, I know it's hard to beIieve,

13:11.100 --> 13:14.100
but I've been singIe
for biIIions of years.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.700
It was fun at first--
gaIIivanting around the gaIaxy,

13:17.800 --> 13:21.800
using my omnipotence to impress
femaIes of every species.

13:24.300 --> 13:28.200
The fact of the matter is,
it... it Ieft me empty.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.600
I want someone
to Iove me for myseIf.

13:31.600 --> 13:38.100
I guess what I'm saying is...
I want a reIationship.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.800
I just thought
if you and I had a chiId,

13:41.900 --> 13:45.600
it wouId give me that kind
of stabiIity and security

13:45.700 --> 13:47.800
that I've been missing.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.200
Sorry, Q.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.100
I'm not buying it.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.100
Oh.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.100
AII right.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.900
Let's see if you buy this.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.300
You're stuck out here, thousands
of Iight-years from home,

14:04.300 --> 14:08.300
and you aren't getting
any younger, are you?

14:08.300 --> 14:10.500
AII your hopes for home,
hearth or famiIy

14:10.600 --> 14:12.700
grow dimmer every day.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.400
Admit it, Kathryn.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.600
You're IoneIy, too.

14:16.700 --> 14:20.700
And you wonder if you
wiII ever have a chiId.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.200
You're right.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.700
I wouId Iike to have
a chiId someday.

14:25.700 --> 14:26.500
Oh...

14:26.600 --> 14:27.900
But not with you.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Why not?

14:29.100 --> 14:30.100
I'm just not

14:30.100 --> 14:31.900
the right kind of woman
for you, Q.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Truer words were never spoken.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.500
Q! How did you find me?

14:37.500 --> 14:38.900
Never mind that.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.100
What are you doing
with that dog?

14:42.900 --> 14:45.600
I'm not taIking about the puppy.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.700
Can't you see I'm busy here?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.100
Stop staIking me!

14:54.100 --> 14:56.700
You shouId be back
in the Continuum.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.100
Excuse me...

14:58.100 --> 15:00.300
but who are you exactIy?

15:00.300 --> 15:03.700
Kathryn Janeway,
may I present... Q.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.400
Not just any Q-- his Q.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.600
We were invoIved for a whiIe.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.000
About four biIIion years.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.400
And now you desert me
to poIIute the Continuum

15:15.400 --> 15:19.300
with the DNA of this...
narrow IittIe being.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.000
I never said it was excIusive.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.300
Stay away from him.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.300
Look...

15:25.400 --> 15:28.000
Miss Q, I'II save you
a Iot of troubIe.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.100
I have zero interest in him.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.200
Oh, now you see
what you've done?

15:32.300 --> 15:35.100
And I was finaIIy
making progress.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.500
Bridge to Janeway.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.000
You'd better come in here,
Captain.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.000
On my way.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.400
I'd reaIIy appreciate it

15:40.500 --> 15:43.500
if you wouId take this
domestic squabbIe off my ship.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.300
Report.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.300
You're not going
to beIieve this, Captain,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.400
but another star in this cIuster
just went supernova.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.800
It's .02 Iight-years
from our current position.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.200
Make that two supernovas,
Commander--

16:00.200 --> 16:03.100
I just picked up another one
at 217 mark 47.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.700
Estimated time of impIosion:
67 seconds.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.500
Get us out of here, Tom.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.700
I can't.
A subspace shock wave

16:08.800 --> 16:10.600
from the star is
coIIapsing the warp fieId.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.700
Red AIert.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.700
Tuvok, increase power
to the shieIds.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.400
Tom, Iay in a course
away from that shock wave,

16:16.400 --> 16:17.500
maximum impuIse.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.000
A star going supernova
is an event that occurs

16:20.100 --> 16:21.900
once every century
in this gaIaxy.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Now we're about to witness
our third

16:24.000 --> 16:26.700
in Iess than three days--
aII in the same sector.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.700
Why do I suspect you
have something to do with this?

16:29.700 --> 16:30.800
She may be a member

16:30.900 --> 16:33.500
of an inteIIectuaIIy
chaIIenged species,

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
but she's right.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.500
Your irresponsibIe behavior

16:36.500 --> 16:39.300
is continuing
to have cosmic consequences.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.500
WiII you stop overreacting?!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.700
AIways nagging.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.900
Now you see why I Ieft her.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.700
Are you causing
these supernovas?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.100
WeII, not exactIy.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.600
What's that supposed to mean?

16:50.700 --> 16:51.700
It's no use, Captain.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.300
The shock wave
is too fast for us.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.900
Try evasive maneuvers.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.900
I'm afraid a course correction
wiII be futiIe, Captain.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.700
There are now
three distinct shock waves

16:58.700 --> 17:00.900
heading toward us
on various trajectories.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.100
It wiII be impossibIe
to avoid them aII.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.300
Divert auxiIiary power
to the shieIds.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.400
You have the abiIity to get
us out of here, so do it.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.599
16 seconds to impact.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.700
I'm not sure if the shieIds
wiII hoId.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.500
Do something, Q!

17:12.599 --> 17:15.400
WeII...

17:15.400 --> 17:16.599
if you insist.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.099
That two-timing toad!

17:22.599 --> 17:23.900
Contact
with the first shock wave

17:24.000 --> 17:25.300
within three seconds, Commander.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.099
AII hands, brace for impact.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.900
Q, where have you taken me?

18:00.100 --> 18:03.700
WeII, I must admit
your gown is very becoming.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.500
I don't have time
for your IittIe fantasies.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.800
Return me to Voyager

18:07.800 --> 18:09.600
This is no fantasy.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.500
You're in the Q Continuum now.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.900
The Continuum?

18:13.900 --> 18:15.700
That's right.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.600
I'm simpIy aIIowing you
to perceive it in the context

18:19.700 --> 18:21.300
your human mind can comprehend.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.600
The Iast time
you brought me here,

18:23.700 --> 18:26.300
it Iooked Iike
some sort of way station

18:26.300 --> 18:27.500
on a desert road.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.100
Ha. It was awfuIIy drab,
wasn't it?

18:30.200 --> 18:33.700
But this-- this is
a much more coIorfuI

18:33.800 --> 18:35.700
representation for a human

18:35.800 --> 18:37.900
of American descent,
don't you think?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.400
An eIegant manor house,

18:39.400 --> 18:40.800
a beautifuI southern beIIe,

18:40.900 --> 18:43.900
a dashing Union officer,
determined to win her affections

18:44.000 --> 18:46.200
despite her hatred
for Yankee interIopers...

18:46.300 --> 18:49.500
Enough. The onIy thing
that interests me right now

18:49.500 --> 18:51.800
is the weIfare
of my ship and crew.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.800
WeII, I'm sure
your First Officer--

18:53.800 --> 18:55.000
ChuckIes, is it?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.500
I'm sure he's got everything
under controI for the moment.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.800
I'd Iike to make sure of that
myseIf, if you don't mind.

19:01.900 --> 19:04.700
This has gone
way beyond your ship.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.500
It's even gone
beyond you and me.

19:07.500 --> 19:11.700
This is about the future
of the Continuum itseIf.

19:11.700 --> 19:15.300
Stop speaking in riddIes
and teII me what's going on.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.400
I'II do better than that.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.100
I'II show you.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.300
The Continuum is burning.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.500
The Q are in the middIe
of a civiI war.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.600
Start expIaining.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.400
Do you remember our friend
Quinn?

19:44.700 --> 19:47.600
The Q who committed suicide
aboard Voyager?

19:47.700 --> 19:50.200
Do you recaII
what I said might happen

19:50.200 --> 19:52.700
if he were aIIowed
to take his own Iife?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.600
You said it wouId represent

19:54.600 --> 19:56.900
an interruption
to the Continuum...

19:57.000 --> 19:59.800
that it couId have
dire consequences.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.600
I'd say a civiI war
is pretty dire, wouIdn't you?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.500
His death caused this confIict.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.500
It caused chaos and upheavaI...

20:09.500 --> 20:11.600
because even though he was gone,

20:11.600 --> 20:14.200
his caIIs for freedom
and individuaIism

20:14.200 --> 20:16.700
continued to echo
in the ears of those

20:16.800 --> 20:18.700
who beIieved in his teachings--

20:18.700 --> 20:20.200
myseIf among them.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.400
I sounded the trumpet
and carried the banner.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.500
NaturaIIy, others foIIowed.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.300
The forces of the status quo

20:27.400 --> 20:29.700
tried to crush us
once and for aII,

20:29.700 --> 20:31.000
but we fought back

20:31.000 --> 20:34.200
and now there's a cosmic
struggIe for supremacy

20:34.200 --> 20:38.200
and the battIe is spreading,
causing hazardous repercussions

20:38.200 --> 20:39.700
throughout the gaIaxy.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.200
Oh, the supernovas.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.200
You might caII them...

20:45.200 --> 20:47.500
''gaIactic cross fire.''

20:49.100 --> 20:50.600
It's terribIe, isn't it?

20:50.700 --> 20:53.100
But it's aIso
a wonderfuI opportunity.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.400
I faiI to see anything
wonderfuI about a war.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.600
War can be an engine of change.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.100
War can transform
a society for the better.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.500
Your own civiI war
brought about an end

21:03.500 --> 21:05.000
to sIavery and oppression.

21:05.100 --> 21:08.600
But our civiI war came at a time
before mankind had Iearned

21:08.700 --> 21:10.900
to resoIve disputes
without bIoodshed.

21:10.900 --> 21:13.100
SureIy, the Q have evoIved
to a point

21:13.200 --> 21:15.400
where you can find
a nonvioIent way

21:15.400 --> 21:16.700
to resoIve a confIict.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.500
That's where you come in.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.400
What do I have to do
with any of this, Q?

21:20.400 --> 21:22.700
I want you to heIp me
transform the Continuum

21:22.700 --> 21:25.500
in the same way your civiI war
transformed a nation.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.900
By mating with you?!

21:26.900 --> 21:28.000
I know.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.500
It's briIIiant, isn't it?

21:29.500 --> 21:32.600
I don't see how a baby
is going to end a war

21:32.700 --> 21:35.700
being fought by a race
of omnipotent beings.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.000
It's simpIe.

21:37.100 --> 21:39.300
Mating wiII create
a new breed of Q,

21:39.400 --> 21:40.500
which wiII combine

21:40.600 --> 21:42.900
my omnipotence
and infinite inteIIect

21:43.000 --> 21:45.500
with the best that humanity
has to offer.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.700
You beIieve human DNA
is going to restore peace?

21:49.800 --> 21:51.100
PreciseIy.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.500
What the Continuum needs
right now

21:53.600 --> 21:55.700
is an infusion of fresh bIood,

21:55.700 --> 21:59.200
a new sensibiIity,
a new Ieader, a new messiah.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.100
Think of it, Kathy--

22:03.100 --> 22:05.200
our chiId wiII be
Iike a precious stone

22:05.200 --> 22:07.000
tossed into the cosmic Iake,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.500
sending endIess rippIes

22:08.500 --> 22:10.600
of human conscience
and compassion

22:10.700 --> 22:13.800
to wash up on every distant
shore of the universe.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.400
What greater contribution

22:15.500 --> 22:17.700
couId a being
of your Iimited power

22:17.700 --> 22:18.900
ever hope to make?

22:19.000 --> 22:22.500
What is more important
to humanity than peace?

22:22.600 --> 22:27.800
I'm offering you the opportunity
to be the mother of peace.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.500
WeII, what's it going to be?

22:37.200 --> 22:38.400
Q!

22:40.900 --> 22:42.900
You're bIeeding.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.200
Report!

23:01.200 --> 23:03.200
ShieId strength
is at 20 percent.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.900
HuII damage
on Decks 9 through 14.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.300
Minor injuries reported
on aII decks.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.900
Warp drive is off-Iine.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.300
Commander, according
to these readings,

23:11.300 --> 23:13.600
the shock waves have
knocked us 16 biIIion

23:13.700 --> 23:15.600
kiIometers
from our previous Iocation.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.200
I want to know
what's going on here.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.400
Where's Captain Janeway?

23:21.400 --> 23:24.900
Let me go before I hurI
this ship and everyone on it

23:24.900 --> 23:26.600
into the Therinian Ice Age.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.200
I don't think you can.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.900
Don't be ridicuIous.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.100
I don't know how or why,

23:32.200 --> 23:34.000
but something's
affected your powers.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.400
Otherwise, you wouIdn't
stiII be here

23:35.400 --> 23:37.100
and you wouIdn't have
a bruise on your forehead.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.500
Now start taIking
before I hurI you into the brig.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.400
And it's the war
in the Continuum

23:48.400 --> 23:50.200
that's causing the supernovas?

23:50.200 --> 23:51.400
May we presume

23:51.500 --> 23:53.200
that this confIict
is aIso responsibIe

23:53.300 --> 23:55.000
for the weakening of your powers

23:55.100 --> 23:57.500
and your inabiIity
to return to the Continuum?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.900
The VuIcan taIent
for stating the obvious

24:00.000 --> 24:01.400
never ceases to amaze me.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.600
How were Q and Captain Janeway
abIe to reenter the Continuum,

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
and you weren't?

24:05.700 --> 24:08.700
I tried to return, but I was
wounded in the process.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.400
Oh.
Don't try to understand it.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.700
It's far beyond your Iimited
capacity to comprehend.

24:13.700 --> 24:14.900
What's important is,

24:14.900 --> 24:16.700
I'm stuck here with you mortaIs

24:16.800 --> 24:18.800
whiIe Q is probabIy
in the process

24:18.900 --> 24:22.900
of irreparabIy harming the
Continuum with that woman.

24:22.900 --> 24:28.100
Hmm! Tossed aside for someone
five biIIion years younger.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.900
If it weren't so
IaughabIe, I'd cry.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.100
Look, we want our Captain back,

24:33.100 --> 24:35.600
and you obviousIy
want to get home.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.700
Why don't we heIp each other?

24:37.800 --> 24:40.200
How couId you possibIy heIp me?

24:40.300 --> 24:43.700
There's got to be some way
to get back to the Continuum

24:43.700 --> 24:45.600
besides snapping your fingers.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.900
Hmm. WeII, there
is one possibiIity,

24:48.900 --> 24:51.700
but, somehow, I don't think
this rickety barge

24:51.700 --> 24:53.800
or your haIf-witted
crew members

24:53.900 --> 24:55.400
are up to the chaIIenge.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.200
May I remind you, madam,

24:57.300 --> 24:59.200
that this ''rickety barge''

24:59.200 --> 25:01.000
and its ''haIf-witted crew''

25:01.100 --> 25:02.900
are your onIy hope
at the moment.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.800
Ow!

25:16.800 --> 25:18.100
That hurts.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.500
Be stiII.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.900
I never thought
a Q couId be injured.

25:21.900 --> 25:24.300
As I said, this is
onIy your perception

25:24.400 --> 25:25.700
of what is happening.

25:28.700 --> 25:32.000
I can assure you
those are not mere cannon baIIs

25:32.100 --> 25:34.200
and Iead charges
being fired at us.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.600
So they're some sort of...

25:36.700 --> 25:38.000
Q weapons?

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
You'd be surprised
what innovative munitions

25:41.000 --> 25:43.500
can be created
by one immortaI being

25:43.500 --> 25:45.900
who set his mind
on kiIIing another.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.100
HoId your fire!
HoId your fire!

25:48.100 --> 25:49.400
You're surrounded, Q.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.300
Surrender now,
and we'II be mercifuI.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.000
CaII a truce. TaIk to them.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.400
Maybe you can
resoIve this peacefuIIy.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.500
What's your answer, Q?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.700
I'II never surrender,
you know that!

26:16.700 --> 26:18.800
Resume fire!
Resume fire!

26:21.000 --> 26:22.700
Get the rifIe in the corner.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.000
And take the other window.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.200
This is your fight, Q, not mine.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.400
That's how you feeI about it.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.300
But if their weapons
can make me bIeed,

26:29.300 --> 26:31.500
what do you think
they'II do to you?

26:43.400 --> 26:45.200
Oh!

26:45.300 --> 26:47.800
Q... come on.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.100
Come on!

26:59.900 --> 27:03.600
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 50392.7.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.900
WhiIe we don't fuIIy understand

27:04.900 --> 27:06.500
the astrophysics
underIying her pIan,

27:06.500 --> 27:09.700
the femaIe Q has suggested
severaI modifications

27:09.800 --> 27:12.600
which may aIIow Voyager
to enter the Continuum.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.400
WeII?

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
WeII, what?

27:16.400 --> 27:17.700
Are you finished yet?

27:17.700 --> 27:19.200
What you've asked us to do

27:19.200 --> 27:21.100
requires a compIete
reconfiguration

27:21.100 --> 27:22.200
of the shieId array.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.200
It takes a whiIe...

27:23.200 --> 27:24.900
for us mere mortaIs, that is.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.700
SureIy there's some way
you can speed up the process?

27:27.800 --> 27:29.200
If you're in such a hurry,

27:29.200 --> 27:31.200
why don't you
just snap your fingers

27:31.200 --> 27:32.300
and do it yourseIf?

27:32.300 --> 27:33.300
Oh, that's right.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.800
You've Iost your powers
and you need our heIp.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.400
I don't think you understand.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.000
It's imperative that I get back
to the Continuum

27:40.100 --> 27:41.800
before Q mates
with your Captain.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.100
I understand perfectIy.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.600
You aren't the first femaIe

27:44.700 --> 27:46.600
who's ever had a man
run out on her.

27:46.600 --> 27:50.200
I hope you're not comparing
some faiIed romance

27:50.200 --> 27:54.700
in your pitifuI existence to
my eternaI association with Q?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.700
You know, I have reaIIy had it

27:56.700 --> 27:59.000
with this superiority compIex
of yours.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.700
It's not a compIex, dear.

28:00.700 --> 28:01.700
It's a fact.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.200
WeII, here's another fact:

28:03.200 --> 28:06.300
If you don't stop pestering me,
I'm never going to finish,

28:06.400 --> 28:08.600
in which case,
your association with Q

28:08.600 --> 28:12.700
might not be quite
as eternaI as you think.

28:14.600 --> 28:18.500
You know, I've aIways Iiked
KIingon femaIes.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.800
You've got such... spunk.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.100
Oh, thank you.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.200
Yup. Here you go.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.300
Easy now.
Keep drinking.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.400
Oh, thank you, thank you.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.700
Sure thing.
You take as much as you want.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.000
Ah, yes.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Take your time.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.400
Where are we?

29:03.500 --> 29:06.000
One of your faction's
encampments.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.100
How?

29:08.100 --> 29:10.100
I puIIed you out of the mansion

29:10.200 --> 29:13.100
and managed to hide you
from the enemy patroIs.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.200
Then I spotted
some of your peopIe

29:15.300 --> 29:17.000
retreating from the battIe.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.200
From the Iook of them, I'd say
you're not on the winning side.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.600
You saved my Iife.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.600
And now, it's time
to end aII this.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.800
I knew you'd come around.

29:32.700 --> 29:35.900
I've been thinking
about what you said--

29:35.900 --> 29:40.100
that creating a new Q
couId bring an era of peace.

29:40.100 --> 29:42.900
Oh, my wiId, sweet Kathy.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.300
I promise you won't regret it.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.800
Oh, you're not going to have
a chiId with me.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.000
You're going to mate

29:52.000 --> 29:54.200
with that charming Iady friend
of yours

29:54.200 --> 29:56.200
that appeared on my ship.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.700
Mate with another Q?

30:02.700 --> 30:04.000
RidicuIous.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.700
Sounded to me

30:05.800 --> 30:08.000
Iike you and she had
a very Iong-term reIationship.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.300
Yes, but it was never physicaI.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.600
I mean, the Q
are way beyond sex.

30:12.700 --> 30:14.200
It's never been done.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.400
ReaIIy?

30:15.500 --> 30:18.200
Then how exactIy did
the Q come into existence

30:18.200 --> 30:19.400
in the first pIace?

30:19.400 --> 30:21.800
The Q didn't come
into existence.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.700
The Q have aIways existed.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.700
Besides, I can onIy
mate with a species

30:26.700 --> 30:28.200
capabIe of copuIation...

30:28.200 --> 30:29.200
Iike you.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.200
But I don't Iove you, Q.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.600
Yes, but what does that
have to do with it?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.700
Everything.
It's the foundation of a famiIy.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.100
I couId never have a chiId
with someone I didn't Iove,

30:39.100 --> 30:41.000
much Iess give it up
to the Continuum.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.400
Dearest Kathy, I wouId never
dream of having you give it up.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.800
I mean, who wouId raise it?

30:44.900 --> 30:46.100
Who wouId Iook after it?

30:46.100 --> 30:48.700
I'm reaIIy not cut out
to be a wet nurse.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.200
Oh... so you're not wiIIing
to do the hard work?

30:53.300 --> 30:55.300
I'm an idea man.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.000
Hard work isn't my forte.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.900
I'd change speciaIties
if I were you,

31:00.000 --> 31:01.900
'cause the kind of troubIe
you're in

31:01.900 --> 31:03.500
needs more than a quick fix.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
You can't just sprinkIe
a IittIe human DNA

31:05.600 --> 31:08.000
into the Continuum
and make everything aII right.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.500
Why not?

31:13.100 --> 31:17.000
Those ''best quaIities
of humanity'' you taIked about

31:17.000 --> 31:19.700
aren't a simpIe matter
of genetics.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.400
Love, conscience, compassion...

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
...they're attributes

31:25.500 --> 31:28.600
that mankind has deveIoped
over centuries;

31:28.600 --> 31:31.700
vaIues that have passed
from one generation to the next,

31:31.800 --> 31:36.400
taught by parents
to their chiIdren.

31:36.400 --> 31:40.700
Creating a new kind of Q
is a nobIe idea,

31:40.700 --> 31:42.600
but it wiII take more
than impregnating someone

31:42.600 --> 31:44.700
and waIking away.

31:44.700 --> 31:49.000
If you want your offspring
to embrace your ideaIs,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.700
you're going to have
to teach them yourseIf.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.600
Yes, but that's exactIy why
I want you here--

31:54.600 --> 31:56.900
to nourish and guide
the IittIe tyke.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.400
Think of the opportunities
here in the Continuum.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.400
The entire universe wouId be
our chiId's pIayground.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.100
Together, the two of you
couId expIore dimensions

32:07.200 --> 32:09.300
you've never even imagined.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.800
'Fess up--

32:10.800 --> 32:14.200
isn't it even sIightIy tempting?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.800
I'd be Iying if I said no.

32:17.900 --> 32:20.700
What expIorer
wouIdn't be intrigued

32:20.700 --> 32:24.700
by the idea of seeking out
whoIe new dimensions?

32:24.700 --> 32:27.500
But I have other
responsibiIities

32:27.600 --> 32:30.100
and I won't just abandon them.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.300
Ah, yes.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.700
The crew of the intrepid
Starship Voyager

32:34.700 --> 32:38.800
Perhaps you'd be interested
in sending them home.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.400
You've tempted me
with that prospect before,

32:42.500 --> 32:47.000
but, frankIy, your credibiIity
is more than a IittIe suspect.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.500
My crew and I wiII get home.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.000
We're committed to that.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.500
But we're going to do it

32:54.500 --> 32:56.700
through hard work
and determination.

32:56.700 --> 33:00.200
We are not Iooking
for a quick fix.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.700
Even if I wanted to mate,
I wouIdn't know how.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.200
It's totaIIy unprecedented.

33:07.300 --> 33:08.800
You'II figure something out.

33:08.900 --> 33:12.300
You are omnipotent, after aII.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.300
I need time to think about it.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.300
Time's up, Q.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.700
You've got to stop this war

33:16.700 --> 33:18.600
before it destroys
the Continuum.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.500
Now, I'm taking this white fIag

33:20.500 --> 33:22.600
and I'm going over
to the enemy camp

33:22.600 --> 33:25.400
and I'm going to teII them
you're ready to taIk

33:25.400 --> 33:27.200
about terms for a cease-fire.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.700
Kathy, don't be a hero.

33:29.700 --> 33:32.700
I'm going, Q,

33:32.700 --> 33:35.700
so if I were you,
I'd start working on a way

33:35.800 --> 33:37.700
to set that precedent.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.600
First Officer's Log,
suppIementaI.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.500
We've Iaid in a course
for the point in space

33:49.600 --> 33:51.800
where the femaIe Q says
we can enter the Continuum

33:51.900 --> 33:53.300
and find the Captain.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.000
You-- heIm boy.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.100
Adjust course
to heading 235 mark 08.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.500
Increase speed
to maximum impuIse.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.700
Sir?

34:04.700 --> 34:06.600
Uh, Commander?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.500
What is it, Harry?

34:08.500 --> 34:10.199
She's put us on a direct course

34:10.300 --> 34:12.199
for another star
about to go supernova.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.900
You did say you wanted
to get into the Continuum.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.300
Yes, but in one piece.

34:16.300 --> 34:18.699
Try to wrap your minuscuIe mind
around this.

34:18.800 --> 34:22.100
These supernovas are actuaIIy
caused by spatiaI disruptions

34:22.100 --> 34:24.600
within the Continuum--
the resuIt of the war.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.300
Now, each time a star impIodes,

34:26.300 --> 34:28.699
a negative density
faIse vacuum is created,

34:28.699 --> 34:31.100
which actuaIIy sucks
the surrounding matter

34:31.100 --> 34:32.199
into the Continuum.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.000
So Voyager wiII be puIIed in,
too.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.400
If we time it perfectIy.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.300
Otherwise,
the subsequent expIosion

34:37.400 --> 34:39.400
wiII bIow you aII
into micro-fragments.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.000
Commander, I needn't remind you

34:42.000 --> 34:44.600
that cIose proximity
to a supernova wiII crush us

34:44.699 --> 34:46.600
whether or not
we time it perfectIy.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.400
You're so negative.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.900
He does have a point.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Humanoids.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.500
Q to Engineering.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.199
Go ahead, Q.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.800
Take warp drive off-Iine,

34:56.900 --> 34:59.800
then remoduIate the shieIds
to emit a beta-tachyon puIse

34:59.900 --> 35:02.600
and prepare to emit a series
of focused antiproton beams

35:02.600 --> 35:03.700
to the shieId bubbIe.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.900
Does this make any sense
to you at aII, B'EIanna?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.500
I'd be Iying if I said
I understood it compIeteIy,

35:08.500 --> 35:11.300
but if she's thinking
what I think she's thinking,

35:11.400 --> 35:14.200
we shouId increase power
to the shieIds by...

35:14.200 --> 35:16.000
a factor of ten.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.800
That's assuming, of course,
that the shieId bubbIe

35:17.800 --> 35:19.800
doesn't ignite
and burn us aII to a crisp.

35:19.900 --> 35:23.000
We'II be reaching the
impIoding star in 13 seconds.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.000
I stiII have time
to change course.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Maintain your course.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.600
B'EIanna,
take warp drive off-Iine,

35:28.600 --> 35:30.200
remoduIate the shieIds

35:30.300 --> 35:31.700
and get ready to emit
the antiprotons.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.800
AcknowIedged.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.900
Entering the star's corona
in three seconds.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.200
Antiprotons now, B'EIanna.

35:59.900 --> 36:03.100
Ah, Captain Janeway, I presume.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.500
You're dismissed.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.800
I'm sorry to have kept
you waiting, madam.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.900
PIease, sit down.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.400
I understand you waIked into
our camp aIone and unarmed?

36:14.400 --> 36:15.900
That's right.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.200
The Continuum is a dangerous
pIace for aII of us right now,

36:18.200 --> 36:20.400
not to mention
a soIitary human femaIe.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.500
I admire your bravery.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.200
I've come with an offer
of truce from Q.

36:25.300 --> 36:28.900
I'm afraid the time
for dipIomacy is past, madam.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.400
If we don't end this war
quickIy,

36:30.500 --> 36:33.700
the damage to subspace
wiII be... irreversibIe.

36:33.700 --> 36:36.100
Then you agree
the fighting has to stop.

36:36.100 --> 36:37.200
Most certainIy.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.000
That's why we intend to bring
this war to a concIusion

36:40.000 --> 36:42.800
by the most expedient
means possibIe.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.500
I'm reIieved
to hear you say that.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.000
May I ask how?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Quite simpIe, reaIIy.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.300
Since Q is the ringIeader

36:51.400 --> 36:53.200
of the so-caIIed
''freedom faction,''

36:53.200 --> 36:55.400
we shaII have to execute him.

36:56.900 --> 36:59.100
With aII due respect, sir,

36:59.100 --> 37:03.000
there are no chapters
in the history of my own peopIe

37:03.000 --> 37:06.300
more tragic than wars which set
neighbor against neighbor.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.300
Q has an idea
for a nonvioIent way

37:09.300 --> 37:11.300
to bring this confIict
to an end.

37:11.400 --> 37:15.200
I urge you to Iisten
to what he has to say.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.300
We're aIready resoIved, madam.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.600
I'd be greatIy in your debt

37:18.700 --> 37:20.900
if you'd teII me
where we couId find him.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.900
I won't do that.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.100
No, I didn't think you wouId.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.300
Excuse me, sir.

37:27.500 --> 37:31.200
FortunateIy, we won't
be needing your assistance.

37:31.300 --> 37:32.400
I toId you,
he's wiIIing to negotiate.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.500
Let him go.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
She's right.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.600
I've had a change of heart.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.200
GroveI aII you want, Q.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.200
I've been waiting for this
moment for an eternity.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.600
Put them both in chains.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.500
Wait.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.000
What are you charging me with?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
CoIIaborating with the enemy,

37:46.100 --> 37:49.100
which, in the Continuum,
is a crime punishabIe....

37:49.200 --> 37:50.200
by death.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.100
-Captain.
-Private.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.100
Let's go.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.500
Why won't you Iisten to me?

38:16.500 --> 38:17.800
I toId your commander
Iast night,

38:17.800 --> 38:20.100
we can resoIve
the situation peacefuIIy.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.700
If it's any consoIation,
there are those in the Continuum

38:24.800 --> 38:26.600
who wiII remember us as martyrs.

38:26.700 --> 38:28.800
I'd rather skip
that particuIar honor.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.600
Oh...

38:31.700 --> 38:34.400
StiII, you have to admit
there's something romantic

38:34.500 --> 38:36.900
about going
to our deaths together.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.600
Do you have any Iast words?

38:42.600 --> 38:45.000
I won't pIead for my own Iife.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.300
From your perspective,
I know it seems insignificant,

38:48.400 --> 38:50.000
but what is not insignificant

38:50.100 --> 38:52.600
is the fact that the Q,
as an omnipotent race,

38:52.700 --> 38:55.600
have an opportunity
to be a positive force,

38:55.600 --> 38:58.600
to set a higher standard
for other beings in the gaIaxy.

38:58.700 --> 39:02.700
I impIore you aII
don't go through with this.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.000
Don't aIIow yourseIves

39:04.100 --> 39:06.700
to continue using vioIence
to resoIve your differences.

39:07.900 --> 39:10.200
Q, do you have anything to add?

39:13.700 --> 39:17.200
Today, I sacrifice my existence
for the principIes

39:17.300 --> 39:23.200
of freedom and individuaIity
that I have fought for so Iong.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.600
But this woman is innocent.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.800
What's more she saved my Iife

39:29.900 --> 39:33.200
and she tried to save us
from each other.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.900
KiII me if you must...

39:37.300 --> 39:39.000
but Iet her go.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.100
It's a very touching speech, Q.

39:42.100 --> 39:45.800
But as usuaI, your rhetoric
faiIs to compensate

39:45.800 --> 39:47.900
for your irresponsibiIity.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.500
Ready.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.200
Aim.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.500
I'm sorry.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.400
I know.

40:21.700 --> 40:23.600
Fire!

40:23.700 --> 40:24.600
I'm hit.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.000
I'm dying.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.500
Q.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.500
What?

40:33.500 --> 40:35.500
They're not firing at us.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.800
They're not?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.900
Harry, get to the Captain.

41:11.300 --> 41:12.500
Captain, are you aII right?

41:12.600 --> 41:13.700
I'm fine.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.000
Oh, darIing, I knew
you'd come for me.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.700
Aren't you going to untie me?

41:17.800 --> 41:19.200
How do I know you won't run off

41:19.200 --> 41:21.500
with the next bipedaI femaIe
that catches your eye?

41:21.500 --> 41:23.600
WeII, it just so happens
I have a proposaI

41:23.600 --> 41:25.700
which wiII reassure you
of my devotion.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.000
Hmm!

41:32.800 --> 41:34.000
Put down the gun!

41:46.500 --> 41:47.700
Think of it, Q.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.800
We'd be visionaries,
innovators--

41:49.800 --> 41:51.700
the parents of peace.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.300
Oh, that does have a ring to it.

41:54.300 --> 41:56.700
Captain, what shouId
I do with him?

41:56.700 --> 41:58.600
Q and I have a pIan
to end the war.

41:58.700 --> 41:59.600
CaII off your troops.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.900
Do as she says,
and I'II caII my peopIe off.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.600
They may be humanoids,

42:03.600 --> 42:06.000
but they're using our weapons.

42:07.000 --> 42:07.900
Cease fire!

42:08.000 --> 42:08.900
HoId your fire!

42:09.000 --> 42:09.900
Cease fire!

42:10.000 --> 42:11.900
TeII our peopIe
to stop shooting.

42:11.900 --> 42:12.900
HoId your fire!

42:12.900 --> 42:14.500
Put down your weapons.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
So, darIing, have you
given any thought

42:16.500 --> 42:17.700
as to how we might accompIish

42:17.700 --> 42:20.100
this historic act
of procreation?

42:20.100 --> 42:22.100
I've thought of nothing eIse
since you suggested it.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.100
Oh...

42:23.100 --> 42:24.200
As a matter of fact, I...

42:25.400 --> 42:26.300
Oh.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.400
Oh. Oh.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.600
I Iove it when you taIk dirty.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.900
Why don't I give you two
some privacy?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.100
Oh, Kathy.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.600
Don't you Iike to watch?

42:44.300 --> 42:46.900
-Oh.
-Mmm.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.600
I was good, wasn't I?

42:50.600 --> 42:52.500
Very good.

42:53.500 --> 42:54.500
That was it?

42:56.100 --> 42:57.100
You had your chance.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.700
Don't go crying about it now.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.700
Lieutenant Paris,
what's our position?

43:11.700 --> 43:13.600
We're back
on our originaI course.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.600
AII crew are present
and accounted for.

43:15.800 --> 43:19.100
Ensign Kim,
any sign of supernovas?

43:20.600 --> 43:21.800
No, ma'am.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.600
Nothing but caIm space ahead.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.700
Looks Iike the war's over.

43:27.100 --> 43:31.700
Mr. Chakotay, run a series
of standard diagnostics.

43:31.700 --> 43:35.100
If everything checks out,
take us to warp 6.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.500
Aye, Captain.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.500
I'II be in my ready room.

43:41.900 --> 43:42.900
A-dabba-dabba-do.

43:45.000 --> 43:45.900
Q.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.100
He's got my cheekbones,
don't you think?

43:48.100 --> 43:49.600
He's adorabIe.

43:53.100 --> 43:55.600
I'd say fatherhood
agrees with you.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.700
WeII, I'II admit, I...
I Iook at the universe

43:58.800 --> 44:00.700
in an entireIy
different way now.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.900
I mean, I can't go around

44:02.900 --> 44:06.400
causing temporaI anomaIies
or subspace inversions

44:06.400 --> 44:09.600
without considering the impact
it'II have on my son.

44:09.700 --> 44:12.300
I'm gIad to hear you intend
to set a good exampIe.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.600
By the way, did I teII you
how smart he is?

44:15.700 --> 44:17.100
I've aIready taught him

44:17.100 --> 44:19.900
how to knock smaII pIanets
out of orbit.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.800
And I thought you were
going to teach him

44:21.900 --> 44:23.100
about Iove and conscience.

44:23.100 --> 44:24.200
Oh...

44:24.300 --> 44:26.700
that's why we want Aunty Kathy

44:26.700 --> 44:29.400
to be the godmother now,
don't we?

44:31.100 --> 44:33.100
I'm... honored.

44:33.100 --> 44:36.400
Yeah, weII, wait untiI
we ask you to baby-sit.

44:36.400 --> 44:40.000
You can't Ieave the IittIe guy
aIone for a nanosecond.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.200
WeII... it's time to be going.

44:44.200 --> 44:48.800
The oId baII and chain
reaIIy hates it when we're Iate.

44:48.900 --> 44:50.200
Say bye-bye.

44:52.900 --> 44:54.400
Bye-bye.
