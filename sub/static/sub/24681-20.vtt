00:01.714 --> 00:04.240
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.318 --> 00:06.411
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.486 --> 00:09.284
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.356 --> 00:11.085
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.226 --> 00:15.990
Everyone's good for Thursday.

00:16.062 --> 00:17.257
Then we're all set.

00:17.331 --> 00:18.889
Pick up
Carmine on the way.

00:18.965 --> 00:21.024
He's too busy
to show up today?

00:22.035 --> 00:24.128
They're leaning on him
pretty hard at work.

00:24.204 --> 00:26.604
What's he afraid of,
getting fired?

00:30.177 --> 00:31.576
No. Try that one.

00:38.952 --> 00:40.214
Perfect.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.489
I'm getting scared, Nicky.

00:44.558 --> 00:48.221
Don't, baby.
I'll be right next to you.

00:50.697 --> 00:52.426
Three months, in advance?

00:53.533 --> 00:57.128
Mr. Richmond, I do not wish to be cruel,
but I'm not sure she has that long.

00:57.471 --> 00:59.302
I'm not sure she doesn't.

01:00.774 --> 01:02.207
And I'll be out of touch
for a while.

01:06.813 --> 01:08.906
Coverage is only
another $9 a day.

01:09.015 --> 01:12.416
Initial here
and here, sign here.

01:12.486 --> 01:13.578
I'll get the keys.
You need a map?

01:14.421 --> 01:16.446
We know where we're going.

01:17.290 --> 01:18.587
Not tonight.
I got something to do.

01:18.658 --> 01:20.956
But Timmons says he wants the
numbers crunched by tomorrow morning.

01:21.027 --> 01:22.995
What do you want me to do,
hold your hand?

01:23.063 --> 01:24.928
Steve, can I tell him
you'll be done?

01:24.998 --> 01:26.488
First thing, Mr. Skoller.

01:28.935 --> 01:31.631
You know, Carmine, I'd catch
your back if you needed help.

01:31.772 --> 01:34.673
Don't kid yourself.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.152 --> 01:50.283
Carmine?
I'm Drew, this is Wes.

01:50.490 --> 01:52.617
It's freezing. You're late.

01:53.393 --> 01:54.758
We've got time.

02:07.474 --> 02:09.305
Hey, are you sure
we're in the right place?

02:09.376 --> 02:10.365
We're sure.

02:11.978 --> 02:13.377
This is it. Turn here.

02:31.631 --> 02:34.156
Hey, man, it's almost
9:00. We're gonna miss it.

02:35.101 --> 02:36.193
We're on time.

02:56.990 --> 02:59.686
Hey, quit...
Quit fooling around.

03:04.030 --> 03:06.055
Hey. Hey!

03:10.470 --> 03:11.630
Stop!

04:10.330 --> 04:12.821
I was working the gate
over at Larrabee Trucking,

04:12.899 --> 04:15.834
I saw this car stopped
at the crossing.

04:15.902 --> 04:17.494
Their headlights went out.
I thought they were stalled,

04:17.571 --> 04:18.697
maybe their battery died.

04:18.772 --> 04:20.000
Anybody get out
of the car?

04:20.072 --> 04:21.233
No, ma'am.

04:21.308 --> 04:23.276
I could make out
people inside.

04:23.343 --> 04:26.506
They must have heard the train. They
kept blowing the horn and didn't...

04:26.580 --> 04:30.038
Thank you, Mr. Clemente, this
officer will take your statement.

04:31.751 --> 04:33.150
Maybe we can get
a shot of what happened

04:33.219 --> 04:35.483
from the security cameras
on those warehouses.

04:35.555 --> 04:37.455
This train come through
here every night?

04:37.524 --> 04:40.322
Twice weekly. We're lucky
tonight it was deadheading.

04:40.393 --> 04:42.827
Normally it's carrying
a load of chlorine gas.

04:42.896 --> 04:43.988
Nice.

04:44.598 --> 04:46.498
Believe it or not,
it could have been worse.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.431
Any other week, we
would have been looking

04:48.501 --> 04:51.061
at a toxic gas cloud
over the Bronx.

04:51.771 --> 04:52.965
There's no key
in the ignition.

04:55.375 --> 04:59.436
The impact wouldn't have knocked
it out. Someone removed it.

04:59.679 --> 05:01.237
That fits what
the eyewitness saw.

05:01.314 --> 05:03.782
He said the headlights
went off.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.647
So the engineer
wouldn't see the car.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.086
Somebody was trying
to cause a toxic spill.

05:12.759 --> 05:14.090
A suicide mission?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.355
It's gonna take days
to ID these people.

05:21.368 --> 05:23.598
Can we get a shot
of this, please?

05:23.670 --> 05:27.106
Make sure that the lab does a
workup on these glass fragments.

05:28.808 --> 05:32.107
It's a rental.
To a Drew Esterhaus.

05:32.178 --> 05:35.443
He took the collision
insurance. Money well spent.

05:36.650 --> 05:38.675
Esterhaus didn't
show up this morning.

05:38.752 --> 05:40.014
Can I ask why
you need his info?

05:40.086 --> 05:42.350
We think he was killed
in an accident last night.

05:42.422 --> 05:45.323
He gave your law firm's
address to a car rental company.

05:45.859 --> 05:49.386
This is his desk.
So what happened?

05:49.462 --> 05:50.451
We're not sure.

05:52.465 --> 05:54.399
Well, it doesn't look like
he worked here very long.

05:54.467 --> 05:57.903
Six months.
He moved from Oregon.

05:58.204 --> 06:02.903
<i>The home address we have for
him is 347 East 41st Street.</i>

06:03.343 --> 06:06.972
That's the Y. Esterhaus ever
mention any environmental issues?

06:07.047 --> 06:09.948
Maybe that's an area your
law firm specializes in?

06:10.016 --> 06:12.450
No. We do trusts
and estates. Why?

06:12.519 --> 06:14.077
What exactly did
you hire him to do?

06:14.154 --> 06:15.178
Research.

06:15.255 --> 06:19.715
Any reason why he looked up regulations
on "do not resuscitate" orders?

06:20.126 --> 06:24.460
He was drafting instructions to a hospital
for a friend. He asked me to look it over.

06:24.531 --> 06:27.125
You remember the name of
this friend, or the hospital?

06:30.537 --> 06:32.402
He said he might be
out of touch for a while.

06:32.472 --> 06:35.339
He pre-paid his mother's care
for the next three months.

06:36.943 --> 06:39.639
His mother is very ill.
What's wrong with her?

06:40.447 --> 06:42.972
She's in the last stages
of Huntington's disease.

06:44.984 --> 06:47.646
Huntington's disease is
inherited, isn't that right?

06:47.721 --> 06:48.745
Right.

06:48.955 --> 06:50.388
Did Mr. Richmond
know that?

06:50.457 --> 06:51.481
Yes.

06:54.094 --> 06:56.062
Richmond's HMO said
he had himself tested

06:56.129 --> 06:58.063
for the Huntington's gene
a month ago.

06:58.131 --> 06:59.496
We don't know the results.

06:59.566 --> 07:00.590
Anybody we can ask?

07:00.667 --> 07:04.228
He lived alone, divorced,
no kids, no girlfriend.

07:04.304 --> 07:07.432
If you have the gene, you get
the disease. There's no cure.

07:07.941 --> 07:10.501
So maybe he's somebody who'd
look for a quick way out.

07:10.577 --> 07:11.566
What about Esterhaus?

07:11.644 --> 07:15.273
He's got one arrest at an anti-Big
Lumber protest in Portland.

07:15.648 --> 07:19.345
He dropped out of law school. No
fixed address for the last three years.

07:19.419 --> 07:21.216
Neither of these guys
left much of a vapor trail.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.915
It's hard to fathom what
their ultimate motive was.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.559
That helps with
the Bell's palsy?

07:27.627 --> 07:29.254
I don't know. I just
gotta wait it out.

07:29.596 --> 07:31.962
The ME just ID'd
the other passengers.

07:32.031 --> 07:34.864
All right, after you do the
notifications, bring in their next of kin.

07:37.771 --> 07:40.740
No, our daughter never
mentioned these men.

07:41.374 --> 07:44.639
How about your son, Mr.
Rozakis, he ever talk about them?

07:44.711 --> 07:47.771
Drew Esterhaus, Wes
Richmond, Carmine Ruggiero?

07:49.749 --> 07:52.343
Any of them active
in environmental causes?

07:52.418 --> 07:57.014
Eugenie always made sure we
recycled, but, no, she wasn't active.

07:57.690 --> 08:00.181
Unless Nicholas got her
involved in something.

08:00.293 --> 08:04.252
My son didn't have time for that
stuff. He was looking for work.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.764
Carmine was totally
focused on his job.

08:06.833 --> 08:09.802
He told me that he was
going to a party later.

08:09.936 --> 08:12.837
He needed a break,
he'd been working so hard.

08:12.906 --> 08:16.899
Mr. Rozakis, is there anything that you
can tell us about Nicholas and Eugenie?

08:18.645 --> 08:20.374
They were just
two kids in love.

08:21.581 --> 08:25.142
Eugenie was very immature.
She didn't know what love is.

08:25.218 --> 08:29.211
Nick told me they'd stop
paying for Eugenie's college

08:29.355 --> 08:30.481
if she kept seeing him.

08:30.557 --> 08:32.957
If she'd just listened to us,

08:33.025 --> 08:34.823
she never would've been
killed in this accident.

08:34.894 --> 08:37.760
That's not true. You
can't control what happens.

08:44.203 --> 08:48.265
Folks, thank you for coming
in. We'll be in touch with you.

08:49.709 --> 08:52.303
Again, we're very
sorry for your loss.

08:58.151 --> 09:00.016
We need a minute,
Mr. Rozakis.

09:00.086 --> 09:02.247
Why? I told you what I know.

09:02.989 --> 09:05.287
You know it wasn't
an accident.

09:05.725 --> 09:08.250
What do you want from me? My son's dead.

09:08.328 --> 09:12.492
Mr. Rozakis, if you know it was
a suicide, you have to tell us.

09:13.867 --> 09:16.734
God, I should've known.

09:17.871 --> 09:20.271
He attempted suicide before?

09:20.340 --> 09:21.568
After his mother died.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.734
I tried to help
him toughen up.

09:24.811 --> 09:28.872
And this time, you have no
doubt it was a suicide. Why?

09:29.582 --> 09:31.447
Did Nick leave a note?

09:32.619 --> 09:34.246
It wasn't a note.

09:36.522 --> 09:40.253
<i>I just can't... I can't live without
Genie, and she can't live without me.</i>

09:41.461 --> 09:44.259
<i>Don't blame yourself, Pop.
It's nobody's fault.</i>

09:44.330 --> 09:48.232
<i>And don't blame Drew and Wes. We
all got together and talked it out.</i>

09:48.301 --> 09:50.531
<i>This is the way
it's gotta be.</i>

09:51.437 --> 09:53.905
<i>I love you, Pop. Goodbye.</i>

09:55.275 --> 09:56.902
He recorded it
with his cell phone

09:56.976 --> 09:58.773
and e-mailed it
to his father.

09:59.245 --> 10:01.577
Yeah, he makes it sound
so damn normal.

10:02.682 --> 10:05.947
They discussed it like a
meeting of the suicide club.

10:06.019 --> 10:08.920
There's other voices
at the end.

10:09.889 --> 10:11.720
<i>I love you, Pop. Goodbye.</i>

10:11.791 --> 10:14.760
<i>Carmine?
I'm Drew, this is Wes.</i>

10:14.827 --> 10:16.226
<i>It's freezing.
You're late.</i>

10:17.230 --> 10:20.859
Doesn't sound like Carmine and the
others knew each other by sight.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.165
The glass in the shoe,
it's Carmine.

10:32.278 --> 10:35.577
I want a graph showing eight
quarters of income, not four.

10:36.349 --> 10:38.078
Do it over.

10:38.818 --> 10:40.615
Leonard?
What?

10:40.687 --> 10:43.087
Carmine Ruggiero's
family called.

10:44.123 --> 10:47.024
He was in the car that train
crashed into Thursday night.

10:47.093 --> 10:49.527
I told his family I'd send
them his personal effects.

10:49.595 --> 10:55.932
No, bring everything to me, his files,
his computer, I'll sort through it.

10:58.504 --> 11:00.131
Whatever you say, Leonard.

11:04.811 --> 11:08.042
It's safety glass from
the car's rear window.

11:08.114 --> 11:11.811
The way it's pressed deep into the
treads, it's not from the collision.

11:12.618 --> 11:15.086
He was trying to kick
his way out of the car.

11:15.154 --> 11:18.646
That's why most of the glass
is embedded in his heel. Thanks.

11:19.993 --> 11:21.824
Maybe when he saw
that train bearing down,

11:21.894 --> 11:23.885
Carmine had a change of heart.

11:24.330 --> 11:27.731
The people in the car, if he'd
never met them face to face,

11:27.800 --> 11:32.100
if he didn't know them, it's possible that
he had no idea what they were planning.

11:33.506 --> 11:37.169
A suicide club, and Carmine
didn't know he was a member.

11:43.116 --> 11:46.574
Carmine had flyers in his apartment
for parties at secret locations.

11:46.652 --> 11:49.746
They send e-mails telling people
where to catch a ride to the party.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.813
That might be where Carmine
thought he was going.

11:51.924 --> 11:53.289
Who set him up?
One of the other four?

11:53.359 --> 11:57.261
No evidence they knew Carmine
or each other before this week.

11:57.797 --> 12:01.028
Four suicidal people don't just
bump into each other on the street.

12:01.434 --> 12:04.870
We're also wondering how they
ended up at the railroad crossing.

12:04.937 --> 12:07.929
None of them ever lived
or worked in the area.

12:08.741 --> 12:12.677
They knew the train schedule
almost down to the second.

12:13.079 --> 12:16.845
Look. This is from the
surveillance cameras, 50 yards away.

12:16.916 --> 12:20.249
Now, less than a minute
after they stop on the tracks,

12:20.319 --> 12:21.946
the train comes through.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.486
Find who provided
this information,

12:26.559 --> 12:29.187
maybe you'll find who
trapped Mr. Ruggiero.

12:32.465 --> 12:37.596
This camera is hooked up to a
network, right? For remote monitoring?

12:37.670 --> 12:39.535
To a dispatch office
in Port Elizabeth.

12:39.605 --> 12:41.436
The images are sent
over the Internet.

12:41.507 --> 12:43.771
If it's unsecured,
anyone can tap in?

12:44.444 --> 12:46.412
With the right search words.

12:49.182 --> 12:50.547
Here we go.

12:54.954 --> 12:56.512
Somebody at
their home computer

12:56.589 --> 13:00.320
could have watched this long enough
to figure out the train schedule.

13:01.894 --> 13:04.658
Can we do a search for this image,
see if it's on any other websites?

13:04.730 --> 13:06.220
Anything's possible.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.033
That one?

13:19.078 --> 13:21.444
There's ours,
and the train schedule.

13:21.581 --> 13:23.572
And five other local
railroad crossings.

13:24.517 --> 13:25.506
"High places. "

13:30.823 --> 13:32.188
The numbers
under each building,

13:32.258 --> 13:35.716
maybe punch-key access codes
for the door to the roof?

13:39.398 --> 13:42.492
Counselor? Counselor,
you have to see this.

13:42.568 --> 13:45.662
This is a website,
it's a suicide how-to.

13:45.738 --> 13:47.433
Could be how they found
the railroad crossing.

13:47.507 --> 13:49.600
There's a chat room
and a message board.

13:52.078 --> 13:55.013
"Joanie and Chachi caught
the train Thursday night.

13:55.081 --> 13:56.844
"They were in fine company. "

13:57.483 --> 14:01.044
Joanie and Chachi, screen
names for Nicholas and Eugenie?

14:01.487 --> 14:03.148
This is where
the four of them met.

14:03.222 --> 14:04.348
Five.

14:04.423 --> 14:06.550
Whoever set up Carmine
had to be on here

14:06.626 --> 14:09.117
posing as him to
talk to the others.

14:09.195 --> 14:11.220
I'll subpoena their records.

14:11.297 --> 14:15.631
A matchmaking service for
suicides. It was bound to happen.

14:16.802 --> 14:18.633
I'll dance in hell before
I turn over anything.

14:18.704 --> 14:21.935
The people who log on to my
website aren't breaking any laws.

14:22.008 --> 14:25.808
Mr. Smythe, we're interested
only in conversations

14:25.878 --> 14:29.109
pertaining to the individuals
who died last Thursday.

14:29.182 --> 14:31.173
Any conversation on
my client's website

14:31.250 --> 14:32.842
is protected by
the First Amendment.

14:32.919 --> 14:36.980
Those individuals exercised not only
their free speech, but their free will.

14:38.257 --> 14:40.521
I have a better idea,
Mr. Smythe.

14:40.593 --> 14:42.288
I'll have you indicted
on four counts

14:42.361 --> 14:44.625
of manslaughter
for aiding a suicide.

14:44.997 --> 14:48.364
You can't scare me. I've
fought this battle before.

14:49.001 --> 14:52.528
I'm invoking my right to
testify before your grand jury.

14:52.605 --> 14:54.004
Be my guest.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.942
My website is a forum for
the free exchange of ideas.

14:58.010 --> 15:00.706
I do not give advice
one way or the other.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.215
I respect the right of
individuals to live their life,

15:04.283 --> 15:06.376
or end it, with dignity.

15:06.953 --> 15:07.942
Thank you.

15:08.287 --> 15:13.919
Mr. Smythe, is this really your
idea of a dignified end to a life?

15:13.993 --> 15:16.223
If it's the end they
chose for themselves.

15:16.295 --> 15:18.786
Myself, I'd probably
go another way.

15:18.864 --> 15:22.265
How? Off a roof in Midtown?

15:22.335 --> 15:23.996
Or the George
Washington Bridge?

15:24.870 --> 15:26.531
Or maybe a poison?

15:27.073 --> 15:28.665
Your website
provides information

15:28.741 --> 15:30.504
for each of these
methods of suicide.

15:30.576 --> 15:34.512
I don't offer anything that
isn't freely available elsewhere.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.878
At the public library,
for example.

15:36.949 --> 15:37.973
Really?

15:38.050 --> 15:41.508
They have a section called
"Suicide For Dummies"?

15:41.587 --> 15:44.351
The people who come to my site
aren't dummies, Mr. Carver.

15:44.423 --> 15:46.653
They've made
an informed decision.

15:46.726 --> 15:50.526
You don't even know how old
they are. They could be children.

15:51.564 --> 15:54.226
Do you offer them
another perspective?

15:54.300 --> 15:57.269
Do you list the numbers
of suicide hotlines?

15:57.336 --> 15:58.997
That's not my responsibility.

15:59.071 --> 16:02.165
What is your responsibility,
Mr. Smythe?

16:02.241 --> 16:04.300
I just post
neutral information,

16:04.377 --> 16:06.072
as is my right under
the First Amendment.

16:06.145 --> 16:07.806
Are you telling us
you did not foresee

16:07.880 --> 16:11.941
that your information would be used
by these people to kill themselves,

16:12.018 --> 16:14.714
to give them that
final push over the edge?

16:14.787 --> 16:17.756
No one who comes to my website
is asking to have their life saved

16:17.823 --> 16:22.817
by me or by Big Brother.
All they want is respect.

16:23.129 --> 16:27.327
And all they get from you,
Mr. Smythe, is indifference.

16:29.335 --> 16:30.393
You're excused.

16:33.873 --> 16:37.365
At this time, the People ask that
the grand jury consider the charges

16:37.443 --> 16:41.038
previously submitted
to you. Yes?

16:41.113 --> 16:45.777
Mr. Carver, the statute says a person
is guilty of second-degree manslaughter

16:45.851 --> 16:49.412
if they intentionally help
another person commit suicide.

16:50.156 --> 16:51.680
But if they're just
providing information

16:51.757 --> 16:53.520
anyone can get at
the public library,

16:53.592 --> 16:54.616
how is that a crime?

16:54.694 --> 16:58.790
Mr. Smythe speaks of a
free exchange of ideas.

16:59.498 --> 17:02.023
There's only one idea
on his website,

17:02.101 --> 17:05.069
that suicide is in every
case a reasonable answer.

17:06.172 --> 17:09.868
He talks of neutral information.
There are no neutral acts.

17:10.409 --> 17:14.140
By assembling this information in
one place, he facilitates suicide.

17:14.646 --> 17:17.513
His website offers
them no alternative.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.642
He says that's not
his responsibility.

17:20.519 --> 17:21.747
Well,

17:24.522 --> 17:29.961
if you see a bleeding man, it
is your responsibility to help.

17:30.963 --> 17:33.454
You can't look away
and do nothing.

17:34.166 --> 17:40.366
It is not your responsibility to
grease the skids of his demise.

17:40.606 --> 17:43.234
Doing that is criminal.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.839
Four counts of manslaughter.

17:49.915 --> 17:52.679
What I get for overestimating
the intelligence of a grand jury.

17:52.752 --> 17:55.380
Just be grateful the D.A. Let
you off with a plea bargain.

17:55.454 --> 17:58.753
I don't consider shutting
down my website a bargain.

17:58.991 --> 18:00.925
All right.
Joanie and Chachi, right?

18:00.993 --> 18:02.824
This is the last chat
I have for them.

18:02.895 --> 18:06.023
Thank you. You can go do
your little dance in hell now.

18:10.069 --> 18:14.699
<i>All right, we've got Chachi
chatting with Lawboy and Flix134.</i>

18:14.974 --> 18:16.498
If Chachi's Nicholas,

18:16.575 --> 18:19.339
Lawboy might be Drew
Esterhaus at the law firm.

18:19.812 --> 18:21.439
They're setting up a meeting.

18:21.714 --> 18:24.649
Whitestone. The hospice
for Wes Richmond's mother.

18:24.717 --> 18:26.309
<i>So he's Flix134.</i>

18:28.053 --> 18:31.955
Well, we got a new
addition here. "Carm00."

18:32.191 --> 18:34.682
Carmine, or somebody
posing as him,

18:34.760 --> 18:37.752
begging off from a face-to-face
before the big night.

18:38.297 --> 18:41.027
Can we search for just
Carm00's entries?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.961
Carm00 and Lawboy.

18:56.315 --> 18:58.909
Edie. A girl
at Carmine's work?

18:58.984 --> 19:02.476
Well, she's mentioned for a reason.
Maybe the reason Carmine was killed.

19:05.758 --> 19:09.558
We're all still in shock about
Carmine. Such a terrible waste.

19:09.628 --> 19:12.461
You're his immediate
supervisor. You knew him well?

19:12.531 --> 19:14.965
Not very.
We have a high turnover.

19:15.501 --> 19:19.028
He was very driven, one of our
most promising finance specialists.

19:19.605 --> 19:22.472
Mr. Skoller, it's your wife.
She's downstairs in the car.

19:22.541 --> 19:24.270
Tell her I'll be
a few minutes.

19:24.677 --> 19:25.666
Mrs. Skoller...

19:25.744 --> 19:27.371
Taking the family
skiing for the weekend.

19:27.446 --> 19:31.473
There's just one more thing. We need
to speak with one of his coworkers,

19:32.251 --> 19:33.980
a woman named Edie?

19:34.553 --> 19:35.713
Edie Elverson?

19:37.590 --> 19:39.751
I'm afraid Edie passed away.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.621
She took her own life
five months ago.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.600
I really should go.

19:52.505 --> 19:56.168
Talk about turnover.
A murder and a suicide?

19:58.410 --> 20:00.002
Or two murders.

20:05.117 --> 20:06.675
<i>Hello? Hubert, I've been going through</i>

20:06.752 --> 20:10.745
<i>Ruggiero's laptop and I've
found some disturbing things.</i>

20:11.190 --> 20:13.124
<i>I need you in here
tomorrow morning.</i>

20:13.192 --> 20:16.787
But, Leonard, I'm with my family
in the Berkshires. We just got here.

20:16.862 --> 20:18.124
Your family can
stay up there, Hubert.

20:18.197 --> 20:22.031
I need you in here tomorrow
morning, first thing.

20:22.134 --> 20:23.795
I work, you work.

20:42.021 --> 20:44.489
Edie Elverson
took a dive off a high-rise.

20:44.557 --> 20:46.855
No evidence of a struggle,
only her prints

20:46.926 --> 20:48.894
on the keypad for
the roof door alarm

20:48.961 --> 20:51.725
and only her prints on a bottle
of wine found on the roof.

20:51.797 --> 20:52.821
She'd been drinking?

20:52.898 --> 20:54.866
Blood alcohol of 0.05.

20:54.934 --> 20:56.697
Her parents said
she'd been depressed.

20:56.769 --> 21:00.330
The roof alarm code was
on the suicide website.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.232
No coincidence Carmine's killer
used the same website to set him up.

21:04.310 --> 21:06.904
He wants to draw a parallel
between the two deaths.

21:08.614 --> 21:12.015
This is a message written
under Carmine's name,

21:12.084 --> 21:14.279
"So much guilt.
What kind of person am I?

21:14.353 --> 21:16.514
"Too late for apologies,
that's the worst. "

21:17.423 --> 21:20.881
Now, Carmine did something to
her maybe that led to her suicide.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.860
Killing him
could be payback.

21:24.463 --> 21:28.422
Carmine Ruggiero?
We know who he is.

21:29.568 --> 21:30.967
He worked
with our daughter.

21:31.036 --> 21:32.697
Do you know how
they got along?

21:32.771 --> 21:34.602
Edie never said they didn't.

21:34.673 --> 21:36.800
Did they have a
relationship outside of work?

21:36.875 --> 21:39.400
No. She wasn't
seeing anyone.

21:39.478 --> 21:41.537
Did you ask Ruggiero
these questions?

21:41.614 --> 21:42.672
No.

21:43.616 --> 21:46.107
He was killed a week ago,
in a collision with a train.

21:46.652 --> 21:51.112
Those kids in that car? I heard
it was some kind of suicide pact.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.249
We're still sorting that out.

21:53.325 --> 21:55.156
But you're asking us
about Edie?

21:55.661 --> 21:58.186
Well, we found a message,
attributed to Carmine,

21:58.263 --> 22:01.824
expressing regret about
something he might've done to her.

22:02.368 --> 22:04.768
The police said
Edie committed suicide.

22:04.837 --> 22:07.897
Maybe Carmine contributed
to her state of mind.

22:09.775 --> 22:12.676
Now, you told the police
she was depressed.

22:13.145 --> 22:16.171
It was that job. She worked
her heart out. Even weekends.

22:16.248 --> 22:18.876
She'd be over for Sunday
brunch and get called away.

22:25.257 --> 22:27.225
Seven-day work weeks
are standard.

22:27.292 --> 22:30.284
Loans to companies in
trouble are deadline driven,

22:30.396 --> 22:32.489
and we have a young staff
with plenty of energy,

22:32.564 --> 22:34.862
and the more they burn,
the more they earn.

22:34.933 --> 22:37.902
Or burn out, Mr. Timmons,
like Edie Elverson?

22:38.270 --> 22:41.103
This isn't work
for the faint-hearted.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.868
Character weaknesses bubble
up to the surface pretty fast.

22:44.343 --> 22:47.540
Carmine Ruggiero, was that
one of Edie's weaknesses?

22:49.214 --> 22:51.444
I never heard that.
Excuse me.

22:55.387 --> 22:56.945
We're waiting, where is he?

22:58.857 --> 23:02.224
Oh. There you are. Hubert'll
answer all your questions.

23:03.595 --> 23:06.758
These files cover Edie's
last two months of work.

23:06.865 --> 23:10.665
Performance review, loans in
progress. And these are Carmine's.

23:10.736 --> 23:13.796
Edie's performance,
how was it?

23:13.872 --> 23:17.330
Her family said that
she worked long hours.

23:17.409 --> 23:20.708
She got the work done, but
she kept missing deadlines.

23:20.779 --> 23:22.906
Any way Carmine
could've submarined her?

23:22.981 --> 23:24.141
No, I would've caught on.

23:26.085 --> 23:28.144
Mr. Skoller, maybe you
can explain this.

23:28.220 --> 23:32.350
There are eight revisions of this
loan analysis that Edie prepared.

23:32.558 --> 23:35.118
Except, each draft doesn't seem all
that different from the previous.

23:35.194 --> 23:39.290
There's new punctuation marks,
the graph's a little bigger...

23:40.566 --> 23:42.431
Were these changes your idea?

23:42.501 --> 23:44.731
No. Mr. Timmons
reviewed these.

23:46.004 --> 23:47.972
A lot of busywork for nothing.

23:48.741 --> 23:51.107
That would be contrary
to the company policy

23:51.176 --> 23:53.906
outlined in our
human resource document

23:53.979 --> 23:56.948
that every employee has to
review and sign once a year.

23:57.015 --> 24:00.473
If we find any other files, I'll
make sure you get them right away.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.684
Each report that Edie wrote
was revised over and over again.

24:06.091 --> 24:08.286
She was called out
for minor mistakes

24:08.360 --> 24:12.387
and dragged in
to work weekends.

24:12.464 --> 24:14.591
Somebody had it in for her.

24:15.067 --> 24:17.399
Well, it's a hostile
work environment.

24:17.469 --> 24:20.905
Maybe that's the reason
for Skoller's legal-speak.

24:21.673 --> 24:24.574
The company being sued
for Edie's suicide.

24:25.344 --> 24:27.505
Edie Elverson's
parents were preparing

24:27.579 --> 24:29.342
for a wrongful death suit
two months ago.

24:29.815 --> 24:33.012
They took depositions,
including Carmine Ruggiero.

24:33.118 --> 24:35.916
I convinced the Elversons'
lawyer to give us a copy.

24:35.988 --> 24:37.717
Short deposition.

24:37.790 --> 24:41.783
The lawyer had scheduled two hours
with Ruggiero, but she cut it short.

24:43.228 --> 24:44.889
Did Longbridge settle
with the Elversons?

24:44.963 --> 24:46.487
The lawsuit
was never filed.

24:46.565 --> 24:50.228
My impression is that the
Elversons decided to drop it.

24:50.302 --> 24:51.360
Maybe this is why.

24:51.436 --> 24:54.928
"Question. Was Ms. Elverson asked to
work more hours than other employees?

24:55.007 --> 24:57.567
"Ruggiero. No. She told
me she came in to work

24:57.643 --> 24:59.668
"because she hated
being at home alone.

24:59.745 --> 25:01.736
"She was uncomfortable
around her family.

25:02.114 --> 25:04.082
"Question. Did she explain
what she meant?

25:04.149 --> 25:05.912
"Ruggiero.
She was drinking a lot.

25:05.984 --> 25:07.679
"She was afraid
they'd find out.

25:08.187 --> 25:12.419
"Question. Isn't it true she was
asked to redo her work for no reason?

25:12.491 --> 25:14.425
"Ruggiero. No.
It was her idea.

25:14.493 --> 25:15.858
"She said she
was afraid Timmons

25:15.928 --> 25:17.452
"would notice she was
making mistakes

25:17.963 --> 25:20.295
"because of her drinking
and fire her. "

25:20.365 --> 25:23.960
"I came in one Saturday, I found
her in the bathroom, getting sick.

25:24.036 --> 25:25.367
"She was drunk,
she was crying.

25:25.437 --> 25:29.737
"She told me she tried to kill
herself in college by taking pills.

25:29.808 --> 25:31.298
"She said no one knew. "

25:31.376 --> 25:32.809
This is how Carmine
let her down.

25:32.878 --> 25:35.711
He lied in his deposition,
like a good company man,

25:35.781 --> 25:38.249
and he sank
the Elversons' lawsuit.

25:39.151 --> 25:40.641
But if he dies
an apparent suicide

25:40.719 --> 25:42.152
because he felt guilty
about lying...

25:42.221 --> 25:45.657
It might help the Elversons'
lawsuit get back on track.

25:45.724 --> 25:48.818
I can think of one person
that would make happy.

25:49.795 --> 25:52.855
I came across these
in my office.

25:52.931 --> 25:54.455
I thought Mrs. Elverson
might want them.

25:55.601 --> 25:57.466
I'm sure she'll appreciate
the thought.

25:57.536 --> 26:01.131
I have to tell you again
how sorry I am about Edie.

26:01.206 --> 26:04.471
We lost another young person
a couple of weeks ago.

26:04.676 --> 26:08.009
Carmine Ruggiero.
Took his own life.

26:09.348 --> 26:12.317
The stress in that office,
it's inhuman.

26:13.719 --> 26:15.619
That's not what
the police think.

26:15.687 --> 26:16.711
What do you mean?

26:16.788 --> 26:20.053
They talked to me and my lawyer
about Edie and the lawsuit.

26:20.125 --> 26:23.424
Like they think I had
something to do with Ruggiero.

26:26.732 --> 26:28.700
Thanks for the pictures,
Mr. Skoller.

26:38.477 --> 26:39.774
What's all this?

26:39.845 --> 26:41.540
Our friends at Longbridge

26:41.613 --> 26:46.482
sent us the contents of
Carmine's desk. Day planner.

26:46.652 --> 26:49.018
See what he had down
for that Thursday.

27:00.966 --> 27:02.331
Something for Edie?

27:09.541 --> 27:14.774
Leonard Timmons? I'm seeing
something sheer and sexy.

27:14.947 --> 27:17.814
Edie Elverson was having
an affair with her boss.

27:17.883 --> 27:19.009
No wonder she felt harassed.

27:19.084 --> 27:21.109
Not to mention suicidal.

27:21.186 --> 27:23.984
Carmine had proof
of the affair.

27:24.056 --> 27:25.421
It's probably stolen
from Edie's desk.

27:27.893 --> 27:30.191
It's considerable leverage
over Timmons.

27:30.262 --> 27:31.354
If I were Timmons,
I might've started

27:31.430 --> 27:33.990
looking at train
schedules myself.

27:39.705 --> 27:42.697
I'm a married man.
I'm not stupid.

27:44.042 --> 27:45.270
I saw what happened
at Boeing,

27:45.344 --> 27:48.108
people getting fired even
for having consensual affairs.

27:48.180 --> 27:53.277
"Saw this and thought of you.
Can't wait to see you in it. Len. "

27:53.752 --> 27:56.277
We had Secret Santa
last Christmas.

27:56.355 --> 27:59.984
I drew Edie's name,
I bought her a funny hat.

28:00.392 --> 28:03.225
The detectives tell me
they can trace this gift card

28:03.328 --> 28:06.195
to the lingerie store
it came from.

28:06.264 --> 28:07.822
That wouldn't prove anything.

28:07.899 --> 28:10.333
You're curious where
we found it, aren't you?

28:10.402 --> 28:11.664
Maybe he already knows.

28:11.737 --> 28:13.261
Carmine Ruggiero had it.

28:13.338 --> 28:16.330
Now, he was blackmailing
you over your affair?

28:16.408 --> 28:18.706
It's why Edie was called in
to the office on the weekends.

28:18.777 --> 28:20.711
It's why she felt
sexually harassed.

28:20.779 --> 28:21.803
She wasn't sexually harassed.

28:21.880 --> 28:25.372
She wanted to break it off, and
that's when you turned on her,

28:25.450 --> 28:28.681
more work, more scrutiny,
until she'd capitulate to you.

28:28.754 --> 28:30.449
That's rubbish.
She felt trapped.

28:30.522 --> 28:33.514
Miss Elverson was already
a troubled young woman.

28:33.592 --> 28:38.325
That lawsuit, that could've
gotten very messy for you,

28:38.397 --> 28:40.831
if it weren't for Carmine. There
was no affair. You can ask anyone...

28:40.899 --> 28:43.060
We'd ask Carmine, but someone
put him in front of a train.

28:43.135 --> 28:47.003
We didn't come here to be
ambushed. Leonard, let's go.

28:51.043 --> 28:53.034
Secret Santa,
that's a new one.

28:54.079 --> 28:57.606
Prove him a liar. Find the
gift that went with the card.

29:01.386 --> 29:04.822
Designer lingerie. I see
marks from garter belt hooks.

29:06.124 --> 29:09.252
But no garter belts
and no matching stocking.

29:09.327 --> 29:11.352
Everything here's rated PG.

29:11.830 --> 29:16.028
You'd think Timmons would shower
her with negligees, sexy bras...

29:19.738 --> 29:22.036
Mr. Elverson,
did Edie have a laptop?

29:22.107 --> 29:23.233
We didn't find one.

29:23.308 --> 29:26.709
She have a diary or electronic
organizer, anything like that?

29:26.778 --> 29:30.839
No. Just old letters, and a photo
album with pictures of her friends.

29:31.516 --> 29:33.245
Could we see that?

29:33.318 --> 29:35.309
I had it out
a couple of days ago.

29:35.887 --> 29:37.252
No lingerie, no computer,

29:37.322 --> 29:40.257
maybe Timmons cleaned her
place out after she died.

29:40.692 --> 29:43.593
You were with the police when
they went into Edie's place?

29:43.662 --> 29:44.651
How did it look?

29:44.729 --> 29:46.788
It looked all right,
a little messy.

29:50.702 --> 29:52.567
You just looked
at these a couple of days ago?

29:52.637 --> 29:54.434
I just added
those office pictures.

29:54.506 --> 29:57.600
Edie's supervisor dropped
them off last Tuesday.

29:59.277 --> 30:01.108
Hubert Skoller?
Out of the blue?

30:01.179 --> 30:03.704
Yes. And he told me
about Carmine Ruggiero.

30:03.782 --> 30:05.875
He thinks it was a suicide.

30:09.054 --> 30:10.453
Well, what did you
say about that?

30:10.522 --> 30:11.921
I told him you people
seemed to think

30:11.990 --> 30:14.390
that I had something to
do with the kid's death.

30:18.530 --> 30:20.725
Okay, thank you, Mr. Elverson.

30:20.799 --> 30:22.357
We'll call you
when we're done.

30:24.803 --> 30:27.271
Hubert hears Elverson's
a murder suspect.

30:27.372 --> 30:30.398
The next day, we
coincidentally find a gift tag

30:30.475 --> 30:32.067
that implicates Timmons.

30:36.448 --> 30:38.643
Hubert Skoller, office enigma.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.751
Timmons found out
she suicided,

30:43.822 --> 30:46.814
he must've sent his right-hand
guy to clean out her apartment.

30:46.892 --> 30:49.520
Which would explain how
Hubert got the gift card

30:49.628 --> 30:52.153
he planted in
Carmine's day planner.

30:52.964 --> 30:54.431
Implicating your boss
in a murder

30:54.499 --> 30:57.093
isn't usually what
right-hand guys do.

30:57.169 --> 30:59.933
Thank you. Well, this might
explain his change of heart.

31:00.005 --> 31:02.496
His deposition in
the Elverson suit.

31:02.574 --> 31:04.235
"Question.
Did Miss Elverson complain

31:04.309 --> 31:06.174
"to you about her work
hours and workload?

31:06.478 --> 31:08.776
"Skoller. No.
Question. When her work was

31:08.847 --> 31:10.610
"constantly sent
back for revisions,

31:10.682 --> 31:13.242
"didn't it occur to you
something was wrong? Skoller. No.

31:13.318 --> 31:16.048
"If I thought she was being
victimized, that she was suicidal,

31:16.121 --> 31:18.749
"and I had done nothing, what
kind of person would that make me?"

31:18.823 --> 31:21.121
That has a familiar
ring to it.

31:28.466 --> 31:30.195
"I see Edie's shadow
everywhere at work.

31:30.268 --> 31:34.068
"So much guilt.
What kind of person am I?"

31:34.773 --> 31:38.539
It was Hubert pretending
to be Carmine on the website.

31:39.311 --> 31:41.541
He feels guilt about
what happened to Edie.

31:43.915 --> 31:47.248
He knows what kind of person
he is, and he doesn't like it.

31:47.319 --> 31:49.685
He's trying to
put things right.

31:49.754 --> 31:52.450
Killing Carmine,
exposing Timmons' affair...

31:53.124 --> 31:55.354
Maybe Hubert kept other
souvenirs from Edie's place.

32:02.534 --> 32:04.661
You gonna finish it for him?

32:05.270 --> 32:07.465
Hubert does beautiful work.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.773
But it's dusty. Looks like he
hasn't touched it in months.

32:11.843 --> 32:14.812
No time. Between the mortgage
and three kids in private school,

32:14.879 --> 32:17.177
he'd better keep it
to the grindstone.

32:17.849 --> 32:21.444
And all of his bills
are past due. Small ones.

32:21.519 --> 32:27.355
$60 for his cable TV, $50
for his kid's ballet lessons.

32:27.692 --> 32:29.751
His alumni association
wanted to honor him

32:29.828 --> 32:33.764
for his work mentoring
undergrads. But he never responded.

32:37.769 --> 32:41.796
He's letting it all slide, even
the things that matter to him.

32:43.775 --> 32:45.868
He's sinking into depression.

32:46.177 --> 32:48.145
He hasn't let
everything slide.

32:49.748 --> 32:54.014
Recent bank and brokerage
statements organized by institution,

32:55.387 --> 32:58.879
insurance policies with
canceled checks attached.

33:04.162 --> 33:06.357
A key to his
safe-deposit box.

33:07.832 --> 33:09.629
For his wife?

33:10.769 --> 33:13.704
Looks like Hubert is getting
all his affairs in order.

33:20.345 --> 33:24.304
Mr. Skoller, it's the Carmichael
loan, I can't make the numbers work.

33:25.450 --> 33:26.644
I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

33:26.718 --> 33:27.707
It's nothing.

33:28.653 --> 33:30.644
Just deleting old files.

33:32.624 --> 33:34.854
Let's take a look at
those numbers, Steven.

33:39.597 --> 33:41.895
I appreciate that you
think he might be suicidal,

33:41.966 --> 33:46.767
but my interest here is putting whoever
killed Carmine Ruggiero behind bars.

33:46.838 --> 33:50.638
If Hubert Skoller dies
before we can get the truth,

33:51.876 --> 33:55.175
no one's interest is served.

33:55.246 --> 33:56.304
If he wanted to
make things right,

33:56.381 --> 33:58.747
why not just expose
Timmons' affair?

33:58.817 --> 34:02.150
He helped Timmons cover up,
he lied in the deposition.

34:02.220 --> 34:04.484
He'd lose his job.
This guy can't afford it.

34:04.556 --> 34:06.820
He probably thought that
Carmine's apparent suicide

34:06.891 --> 34:08.449
would bolster
the Elversons' claim

34:08.525 --> 34:11.120
that Longbridge was
a hostile work environment.

34:11.196 --> 34:12.185
That's who he
was trying to help.

34:12.263 --> 34:14.128
But now it's
falling apart on him.

34:14.199 --> 34:18.226
Look, if we give him a way
out... He panicked the last time

34:18.303 --> 34:20.237
he thought that we were
going after the wrong man.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.000
I'll calendar the grand jury
in the morning

34:25.076 --> 34:28.806
to consider a bill of indictment
against Frank Elverson,

34:29.547 --> 34:34.348
by which time you should be serving
this subpoena on Mr. Skoller.

34:35.085 --> 34:37.145
That is what
you have in mind, isn't it?

34:37.222 --> 34:39.850
Almost. We'll need another
one for Len Timmons.

34:44.228 --> 34:45.456
Perfect.

34:48.366 --> 34:50.163
So they roped you in, too.

34:50.235 --> 34:51.429
Do you know what it's about?

34:52.270 --> 34:56.400
Well, it says right here on the
subpoena, "People versus Elverson. "

34:56.474 --> 34:58.339
Seems pretty clear to me.

34:58.410 --> 34:59.741
They're indicting
Frank Elverson

34:59.811 --> 35:01.745
for the murder
of Carmine Ruggiero.

35:03.114 --> 35:04.274
Oh, my God.

35:06.518 --> 35:10.477
Hubert, my lawyer has some advice
on handling the D.A.'s questions.

35:11.489 --> 35:15.220
It's important your answers stay
on point. Don't volunteer anything.

35:15.293 --> 35:20.196
You got that, Hubert? Stay on
point. Don't embarrass the company.

35:21.232 --> 35:23.462
Good, you're both here.

35:23.535 --> 35:27.699
Before you testify, I need you
to sign these waivers of immunity.

35:28.907 --> 35:31.842
You'll be testifying before a
grand jury assembled to consider

35:31.943 --> 35:34.343
a bill of indictment
against Frank Elverson

35:34.412 --> 35:36.676
for the murder
of Carmine Ruggiero.

35:36.748 --> 35:38.443
You're expected
to answer truthfully

35:38.516 --> 35:40.450
and to the best
of your knowledge.

35:40.518 --> 35:42.952
I don't think I have
anything relevant to offer.

35:43.021 --> 35:45.148
You let me worry
about that, Mr. Skoller.

35:53.531 --> 35:56.625
Well, there are some things
we need to go over

35:56.701 --> 35:59.568
to help Mr. Carver
prepare for your testimony.

35:59.637 --> 36:02.299
Why does he think
Mr. Elverson killed Carmine?

36:02.373 --> 36:05.342
Now, I've met Mr. Elverson,
he didn't seem the type.

36:06.277 --> 36:08.245
We can't discuss
evidence with you.

36:08.313 --> 36:10.247
Except evidence they
already know about.

36:10.315 --> 36:12.180
You know, the lawsuit.

36:15.286 --> 36:17.447
Carmine's deposition
blew it out of the water.

36:17.522 --> 36:21.959
With Elverson,
it's all about money.

36:24.128 --> 36:27.029
It's like what you said about
his daughter in your deposition,

36:27.098 --> 36:32.126
she's aloof,
not a team player...

36:32.203 --> 36:34.899
That's right.
Very standoffish.

36:34.973 --> 36:37.601
Usually a sign of
personality problems.

36:40.745 --> 36:43.908
Did you ever get the box of
materials from Carmine's desk?

36:43.982 --> 36:46.177
Got it the same day
you sent it.

36:46.251 --> 36:48.742
That's how we found
your card to Edie.

36:52.824 --> 36:53.848
Really?

36:53.925 --> 36:55.688
Tucked into
Carmine's day planner.

36:57.495 --> 37:03.195
Mr. Timmons said that it was
from his Secret Santa gift.

37:03.268 --> 37:05.133
A funny hat, right?

37:05.203 --> 37:06.431
That's right, a hat.

37:07.772 --> 37:10.707
You remember, Hubert,
at the Christmas party?

37:11.809 --> 37:13.800
Yes, Leonard, I remember.

37:15.313 --> 37:17.907
I'm sure Edie
didn't need a hat.

37:17.982 --> 37:21.941
She was probably
already wearing a lampshade.

37:22.587 --> 37:25.647
Yeah, that's the impression we got
of her from Carmine's deposition.

37:25.723 --> 37:27.384
She had a drinking problem.

37:27.458 --> 37:30.086
That had to be hard for
Elverson to hear from Carmine.

37:31.396 --> 37:32.920
No wonder he went
after the kid.

37:32.997 --> 37:34.965
I never saw any
evidence of drinking.

37:36.334 --> 37:37.323
Hmm.

37:37.835 --> 37:40.269
How about you, Mr. Timmons,
you ever notice anything?

37:40.338 --> 37:44.968
Unfortunately, yes. I saw her
come out of a bar near the office

37:45.109 --> 37:47.873
on a couple of occasions,
in the middle of the day.

37:47.946 --> 37:52.212
Edie's funny hat,
you know...

37:53.518 --> 37:55.918
We never...
What did it look like?

37:56.521 --> 37:59.718
It was green,
like for a Christmas elf.

38:00.391 --> 38:02.882
If you knew Edie was
drinking during work,

38:02.961 --> 38:04.326
why didn't you
reprimand her?

38:04.429 --> 38:07.887
Yeah, Hubert'll tell you, I'm
no hard-ass. I gave her a chance.

38:08.733 --> 38:11.827
I just had no idea
how bad it was.

38:15.273 --> 38:16.706
You had no idea?

38:17.842 --> 38:21.107
That's what Hubert said
in his deposition.

38:23.715 --> 38:26.843
Because if he had an idea
how suicidal she was,

38:26.918 --> 38:31.912
and he did nothing, what kind
of person would that make him?

38:31.990 --> 38:33.480
Exactly right.

38:36.361 --> 38:39.330
A green Christmas elf hat,
is that...

38:40.031 --> 38:42.158
That's really what
he gave her?

38:45.737 --> 38:49.332
Come on, Hubert, you can't
take this anymore, man.

38:53.077 --> 38:55.307
There was no
damned funny hat.

38:56.481 --> 39:00.577
He gave her red stockings, garter
belts, all kinds of lingerie.

39:00.652 --> 39:02.017
He was having
an affair with her.

39:02.086 --> 39:03.917
Hubert, what the hell
are you talking about?

39:03.988 --> 39:06.684
I can't listen to
any more of your lies.

39:06.758 --> 39:09.318
After she died, Len gave
me a key to her apartment

39:09.394 --> 39:10.759
and a list of everything
he'd given her,

39:10.828 --> 39:12.557
and he told me
to take it all.

39:12.630 --> 39:15.758
You bastard.
You're finished. Finished!

39:15.833 --> 39:18.563
The affair, that's why he harassed
her, that's why he victimized her?

39:18.736 --> 39:21.967
Yes, when she wouldn't
sleep with him anymore.

39:23.474 --> 39:25.374
He said he'd crush her.

39:25.810 --> 39:27.641
He kept punishing her
and punishing her

39:27.712 --> 39:29.839
till she couldn't
take it anymore.

39:29.914 --> 39:32.382
And she came to you
for help, didn't she?

39:32.784 --> 39:36.049
She was too ashamed to file a
complaint. She asked me to talk to him.

39:38.756 --> 39:40.189
What did you do?

39:43.995 --> 39:45.053
Nothing.

39:47.331 --> 39:49.765
I was afraid of Leonard,
of losing my job.

39:51.102 --> 39:53.161
I told her she'd have to
tough it out.

39:54.305 --> 39:57.570
You shut the door on her.
That did it.

39:59.744 --> 40:01.974
Even so, Hubert,
it doesn't change anything.

40:02.046 --> 40:04.173
You still have to testify
in the Elverson case.

40:04.248 --> 40:08.309
It changes everything. He's the
one with a reason to kill Carmine.

40:08.386 --> 40:10.320
Carmine knew about the affair.

40:10.388 --> 40:12.288
What was Carmine
gonna say about it?

40:12.390 --> 40:15.450
He'd already lied under oath.
He was no threat to Timmons.

40:15.526 --> 40:18.461
You see, Elverson's still
got the better motive.

40:18.996 --> 40:21.658
The D.A.'s not gonna back off
on prosecuting him.

40:21.733 --> 40:24.531
Oh, God. Oh, God.

40:25.470 --> 40:26.494
I got to get out of here.

40:26.571 --> 40:27.560
Hubert, do not leave.

40:27.638 --> 40:28.935
Please, I just need some air.

40:29.006 --> 40:30.940
Now you know how Edie felt.

40:32.443 --> 40:34.604
Trapped, no way out.

40:34.679 --> 40:37.409
We found that box with
your papers neatly arranged,

40:37.482 --> 40:39.074
the key to the safety deposit.

40:39.150 --> 40:41.209
We know what you're
planning to do.

40:41.285 --> 40:43.048
And then what?

40:43.254 --> 40:46.018
Frank Elverson takes
the rap for killing Carmine?

40:46.791 --> 40:48.554
What about you wanting
to set things right?

40:48.626 --> 40:50.150
What, does that become
an empty gesture?

40:50.228 --> 40:52.287
You end up hurting
Edie's parents,

40:52.363 --> 40:54.228
the very people
you tried to help.

40:54.932 --> 40:56.627
I don't know what to do.
Yeah, you do.

40:56.701 --> 40:58.191
I don't know what to do.
Make things right!

40:58.269 --> 40:59.861
I tried, but look
what happened!

40:59.937 --> 41:02.770
You tried because you wanted
to be a good person.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.637
Make things right.
Well, be a good person now.

41:04.709 --> 41:06.006
Hey, look at me!

41:09.347 --> 41:10.678
A good person, Hubert.

41:13.117 --> 41:14.778
Because you're
better than him.

41:14.852 --> 41:16.183
Oh, God.

41:20.625 --> 41:23.185
Be a good person.
You make things right.

41:32.570 --> 41:36.301
I put Carmine in that car.

41:38.576 --> 41:40.373
I knew what would
happen to him.

41:48.452 --> 41:50.886
You made him
one of your guys.

41:51.823 --> 41:56.317
He lied for you,
and so did I,

41:58.429 --> 42:00.090
until I couldn't.

42:05.570 --> 42:07.037
I couldn't...

42:10.875 --> 42:12.433
Okay, Hubert.

42:13.845 --> 42:14.937
Okay.

42:18.416 --> 42:20.384
Now you're under arrest.

42:26.157 --> 42:30.617
You use, you use, you use...

42:31.896 --> 42:37.425
Fifteen years I've watched you use
them up, all the Edies and Carmines.

42:38.269 --> 42:42.365
Well, no more.
No more! No more!

42:51.749 --> 42:53.740
I'll be talking to you,
Mr. Timmons.

42:53.818 --> 42:55.786
In the meantime, you might
familiarize yourself

42:55.853 --> 42:59.414
with such legal terms
as obstruction and perjury.

43:09.166 --> 43:13.125
Killing Carmine, he was
really killing himself.

43:13.838 --> 43:15.806
It's a step
he should've skipped.
