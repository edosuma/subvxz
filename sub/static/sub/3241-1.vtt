00:10.010 --> 00:13.890
<i>People disappear all the time.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:16.725
<i>Young girls run away from home.</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:20.904
<i>Children stray from their parents
and are never seen again.</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:26.281
<i>Housewives take the grocery money
and a taxi to the train station.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.113
<i>Most are found, eventually.</i>

00:29.196 --> 00:34.123
<i>Disappearances, after all, have explanations.</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:35.703
<i>Usually.</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:43.377
<i>Strange, the things you remember.</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:47.090
<i>Single images and feelings
that stay with you down through the years.</i>

00:48.674 --> 00:52.975
<i>Like the moment Yd realized,
I'd never owned a vase.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:57.729
<i>That I'd never lived in any place long enough
to justify having such a simple thing.</i>

01:00.143 --> 01:02.316
<i>And how at that moment,</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:06.742
<i>I wanted nothing so much in all the world
as to have a vase of my very own.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:13.160
<i>It was a Tuesday afternoon,</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:15.208
<i>six months after the end of the war.</i>

01:23.667 --> 01:25.340
Oh, God!

01:25.419 --> 01:26.420
Hold him.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.755
Hold him right now! You hear me?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.010
Jesus Christ!

01:30.841 --> 01:32.013
You're going home, right?

01:33.135 --> 01:34.136
Here, quickly!

01:37.264 --> 01:38.686
Doctor, doctor!

01:38.932 --> 01:40.024
Oh, God!

01:40.100 --> 01:42.694
I'll have to clamp the femoral artery
before he bleeds out!

01:42.769 --> 01:45.113
It's all right, Jackie boy. You're going
home, mate. You're going home.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.656
Oh, my God!

01:52.446 --> 01:53.493
Jesus!

01:53.572 --> 01:54.824
Move.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.920
We've got him now, nurse.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.217
Scalpel!

02:27.230 --> 02:29.824
Claire! Did you hear? It's over!

02:29.900 --> 02:31.902
It's really, finally over!

02:34.154 --> 02:35.155
Hi!

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

03:06.645 --> 03:10.570
<i>Somehow, in my mind, V-E Day,</i>

03:10.649 --> 03:15.155
<i>the end of the bloodiest
and most terrible war in human history,</i>

03:15.237 --> 03:17.456
<i>grows fainter with each passing day.</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:22.377
<i>But I can stiff recall
every detail of the day,</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:26.628
<i>when I saw the life I wanted
sitting in a window.</i>

03:26.707 --> 03:28.380
<i>I sometimes wonder
what would have happened</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:32.133
<i>if I'd bought that vase
and made a home for it.</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:34.260
<i>Would that have changed things?</i>

03:35.298 --> 03:37.175
<i>Would I have been happy?</i>

03:37.259 --> 03:39.057
<i>Who can say?</i>

03:39.136 --> 03:40.763
<i>I do know this.</i>

03:40.846 --> 03:43.725
<i>Even now, after all the pain and death</i>

03:43.807 --> 03:45.730
<i>and heartbreak that followed,</i>

03:45.809 --> 03:48.153
<i>I still would make the same choice.</i>

05:31.790 --> 05:35.670
<i>We were in Scotland
on our second honeymoon.</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:38.130
<i>Or at least that's what Frank called it.</i>

05:38.213 --> 05:42.434
<i>A way to celebrate the end of the war years
and begin our lives anew.</i>

05:45.470 --> 05:48.019
<i>But it was more than that.</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:51.398
<i>I think we both felt a holiday
would be a convenient masquerade</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:54.946
<i>for the real business of getting to know
the people we'd become</i>

05:55.021 --> 05:56.898
<i>after five years apart.</i>

06:02.362 --> 06:04.114
- What do you suppose that is?
- Huh?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.707
Oh, good Lord. Blood.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.293
Are you sure?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.664
I think I should know
the look of blood by now.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.382
There's a stain just like it
on the house next door.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.090
There's two more over there.

06:22.507 --> 06:26.102
We seem to be surrounded
by homes marked with blood.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.054
Perhaps Pharaoh has refused Moses,

06:28.138 --> 06:31.483
and the spirit of death will travel
the streets of Inverness tonight,

06:31.558 --> 06:34.107
sparing only those who mark
their doors with lamb's blood.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.404
You may be closer than you think.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.402
Could well be
some sort of sacrificial ritual,

06:38.481 --> 06:40.984
but I suspect pagan
rather than Hebrew.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.992
I had no idea Inverness was such
a hotbed of contemporary paganism.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.664
Well, my dear, there's no place on earth

06:46.740 --> 06:49.084
with more magic and superstition
mixed into its daily life

06:49.159 --> 06:50.160
than the Scottish Highlands.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.588
Shall we?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.040
Lead on.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.062
The blood you saw
is that of a black cockerel.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.394
It's an old custom at this time of year

07:11.473 --> 07:14.898
to make such a sacrifice
to honor Saint Odhran.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.401
Odhran,
he was sainted in the eighth century?

07:19.189 --> 07:20.532
You know yer history.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.235
I'm afraid my husband is a historian,
Mrs. Baird.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.658
He'd quite happily stand here
holding forth for hours

07:25.737 --> 07:26.909
if you encourage him.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.581
Hardly.

07:28.657 --> 07:33.288
Highland folklore is far from my specially,
but am I right in thinking there's an...

07:33.411 --> 07:35.914
Is there an old saying
associated with Saint Odhran?

07:39.709 --> 07:42.679
Yes. "The Earth went over Odhran's eyes."

07:44.172 --> 07:47.176
He was buried alive voluntarily.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.305
Charming.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.853
Are ye a professor then, Mr. Randall?

07:50.929 --> 07:52.556
I will be soon.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.609
He's accepted a post at Oxford
beginning in two weeks.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.357
Then this is a last holiday

07:57.435 --> 08:00.439
before settling down
to a workaday life again, is it?

08:00.522 --> 08:04.072
Well, you've picked a bonnie time to be here,
just nigh on Samhain.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.448
I take it that's Gaelic for Halloween?

08:06.528 --> 08:08.872
Well, Halloween is derived from Samhain.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.370
The Church often took pagan holidays
and renamed them for their own purposes.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.750
Samhain became Halloween,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.174
Yule became Christmas, and so on...

08:19.249 --> 08:21.968
Well, you're both welcome at the festival,
of course.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.468
Mind you, ghosts are freed on the feast days,

08:25.547 --> 08:26.924
and they'll be wandering about,

08:27.090 --> 08:29.309
free to do good or ill as they please.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.929
Of course. What would Halloween...

08:32.053 --> 08:34.397
Samhain be without a good ghost story?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.691
And we have those for sure.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.188
I'll show you to your room.

08:45.108 --> 08:48.328
<i>Before the war, we were inseparable.</i>

08:48.403 --> 08:53.079
<i>But for the next five years,
we saw each other a grand total of 10 days.</i>

08:53.158 --> 08:55.001
It's not without its charms.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.625
Beats an army tent and a cot in the mud.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.831
Indeed.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.051
<i>When the war ended,</i>

09:08.131 --> 09:11.681
<i>we both thought things would
return to the way they once were,</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:13.348
<i>but they hadn't.</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:19.392
Gosh!

09:20.602 --> 09:22.479
So much for marital privacy.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.155
Do you think the sound carries?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.233
Well, I think it's fair to say

09:26.316 --> 09:30.071
Mrs. Baird will be kept apprised
of any renewed attempt to start a family.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.546
Lazybones.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.758
You'll never manage
the next branch on your family tree

09:43.833 --> 09:45.426
if you don't show more industry than that.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.879
Really?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.384
What are you doing?

09:52.717 --> 09:55.311
- Come on.
- Mrs. Randall,

09:55.386 --> 09:57.013
what am I to do with you?

09:58.848 --> 09:59.974
Right.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.858
What are you doing?
You're gonna break the bed.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.003
You know, one of those things

10:21.079 --> 10:24.504
I used to try and remember lying in my cot,

10:24.582 --> 10:26.960
was the sound of my husband's laugh.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.714
I couldn't conjure it no matter what I did.

10:31.214 --> 10:35.811
I couldn't hear it even though
I'd heard it a million times before.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.066
- It's the strangest thing.
- I know.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.772
I used to...

10:49.065 --> 10:50.533
I used to sketch this.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.736
- My hand?
- Well...

10:52.861 --> 10:54.454
The lines, really.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.160
Why exactly, I'm not sure,

10:57.240 --> 11:00.665
but I had a very clear memory
of this... This pattern.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.212
Made little doodles everywhere.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.004
There was...

11:07.083 --> 11:08.426
A brigadier once dressed me down

11:08.501 --> 11:11.550
because I drew it in the margin
of a report for the minister.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.390
Yeah.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.989
Claire...

12:18.571 --> 12:19.788
Happy?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.207
Yes.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.587
<i>Frank's passion for history</i>

12:25.662 --> 12:28.415
<i>was another reason
for choosing the Highlands.</i>

12:28.498 --> 12:30.171
You see up there?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.423
The top there, that's Cocknammon Rock.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.300
And in the 17th and 18th centuries,

12:34.379 --> 12:36.928
you'd have often found
a British Army patrol up there

12:37.006 --> 12:39.885
lying in wait for Scottish rebels
and brigands.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.722
Can you see how it commands
the high ground in every direction?

12:43.805 --> 12:46.934
It was a perfect position for an ambush.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.939
<i>Not that I minded.</i>

12:49.018 --> 12:52.147
<i>I was raised by my uncle
after the death of my parents.</i>

12:58.403 --> 13:00.781
<i>Uncle Lamb was an archeologist,</i>

13:00.863 --> 13:03.491
<i>so, I'd spent the balance
of my formative years</i>

13:03.574 --> 13:05.201
<i>traipsing through dusty ruins</i>

13:05.285 --> 13:08.084
<i>and various excavations
throughout the world.</i>

13:08.162 --> 13:11.041
<i>I'd learned to dig latrines and boil water,</i>

13:11.124 --> 13:15.004
<i>and to do a number of other things not
suitable for a young lady of gentle birth.</i>

13:15.086 --> 13:17.054
- Uncle?
- Yes.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.469
The very thought.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.117
<i>Frank's new-found passion was genealogy.</i>

13:42.196 --> 13:44.324
<i>His personal genealogy, that is.</i>

13:45.366 --> 13:46.959
<i>Mine was botany.</i>

13:47.035 --> 13:48.628
<i>I'd developed a keen interest</i>

13:48.703 --> 13:51.877
<i>in the use of plants and herbs
for medicinal purposes.</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:56.545
So, from what I can gather,

13:56.627 --> 13:59.050
Castle Leoch was the ancestral home

13:59.130 --> 14:01.224
of the Laird of the MacKenzie clan

14:01.299 --> 14:03.142
until midway through the 19th century.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.679
Here, take a look.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.411
<i>In a way, burying himself in the distant past</i>

14:25.490 --> 14:28.039
<i>gave Frank an ability to escape the recent.</i>

14:29.285 --> 14:32.414
<i>While I was in the army,
Frank had sewed in London.</i>

14:32.497 --> 14:35.091
<i>Intelligence, overseeing spies</i>

14:35.166 --> 14:37.385
<i>and running covert operations.</i>

14:37.460 --> 14:39.633
So, I think this might have been the kitchen.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.555
Really?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.725
I would say that's probably a hearth.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.646
Yeah.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.732
Strange.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.156
I have no evidence
that my ancestor visited this castle,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.734
but it was within his operational sphere.

15:00.817 --> 15:05.914
So, it is just possible
that he walked these very halls.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.546
<i>He'd sent dozens of men
behind the lines on secret missions,</i>

15:13.621 --> 15:15.669
<i>and most never came back.</i>

15:17.125 --> 15:19.878
<i>He didn't talk about it very often,</i>

15:19.961 --> 15:22.009
<i>but I knew it prayed on him.</i>

15:56.873 --> 15:58.045
It won't open.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.258
Come on.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.838
Three, two, one...

16:38.247 --> 16:40.170
What do you think this was used for?

16:40.625 --> 16:43.094
From the lack of proper lighting
and ventilation,

16:43.169 --> 16:47.640
I would say province of the castle hermit.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.301
Or perhaps a troll or two.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.647
I don't think trolls live in pairs.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.605
Solitary creatures, they.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.980
It's a pity.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.820
All this,

17:05.900 --> 17:07.777
and no one to share it with.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.162
You'll get dirty.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.458
You can give me a bath.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.728
Why, Mrs. Randall,

17:38.808 --> 17:41.357
I do believe you've left
your undergarments at home.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.734
Yes! Yes, yes, yes.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.527
- I found him.
- Indeed.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.150
Let us have a look.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.778
Him? Is it Walter?

18:27.857 --> 18:31.202
No, darling, Jonathan.
Jonathan Wolverton Randall. Finally.

18:31.527 --> 18:35.282
Captain of dragoons in the British army,

18:35.364 --> 18:36.866
and your direct ancestor.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.121
Exactly.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.827
Otherwise known as "Black Jack."

18:39.910 --> 18:41.753
A rather dashing nickname

18:41.829 --> 18:44.423
that he probably acquired
while he was stationed here in the 1740s.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.842
The Reverend has found
a series of army dispatches

18:46.917 --> 18:49.261
- that mention the Captain by name.
- How exciting.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.589
It is.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.174
Good to see all your sleuthing
over the past week has paid off.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.930
Yes, I was beginning to wonder.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.808
It appears Black Jack
commanded the garrison

18:57.887 --> 19:00.390
at Fort William for four years or so.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.142
Seems to have spent quite a bit of his time

19:02.224 --> 19:03.601
harassing the Scottish countryside

19:03.684 --> 19:05.027
on behalf of the Crown.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.776
Well, he was hardly alone in that endeavor.

19:07.855 --> 19:08.981
The English were deeply unpopular

19:09.065 --> 19:10.863
throughout the Highlands
in the 18th century.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.077
And well into the 20th, it would seem.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.655
I distinctly heard the barman
at that pub last night

19:15.738 --> 19:18.241
refer to us as "Sassenachs."

19:18.991 --> 19:20.834
I hope you didn't take offense.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.459
It only means "Englishman" after all,

19:23.537 --> 19:26.336
or at worst, "Outlander."

19:27.249 --> 19:29.718
I've brought you a wee bit of refreshment,
gentlemen.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.671
I've brought but the two cups,

19:31.754 --> 19:35.008
for I thought perhaps Mrs. Randall
might care to join me in the kitchen...

19:35.091 --> 19:38.595
Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.932
See you later.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.113
This person here...

19:50.981 --> 19:53.734
It's been so long
since I've had a good cup of oolong.

19:53.818 --> 19:57.072
Aye, I couldn't get it during the war.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.124
It's the best for the readings, though.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.828
I had a terrible time with that Earl Grey.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.791
The leaves fall apart so fast,
it's hard to tell anything at all.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.595
So, you read tea leaves, then?

20:13.713 --> 20:16.057
Like my grandmother taught me.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.141
And her grandmother before that.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.517
Drink up your cup.
Let's see what we've got there.

20:34.358 --> 20:39.114
Well, am I going to meet a tall, dark
stranger and take a trip across the sea?

20:39.196 --> 20:40.368
Could be.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.666
Or could not.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.248
Everything in it is contradictory.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.254
There's a curved leaf,
which indicates a journey,

20:51.333 --> 20:53.961
but it's crossed by a broken one,

20:54.044 --> 20:55.921
which means staying put.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.727
And there are strangers there,
to be sure, several of them.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.311
And one of them's your husband,
if I read the leaves all right.

21:07.475 --> 21:08.818
Show me your hand, dear.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.734
Odd.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.453
Most hands have a likeness to them.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.121
There are patterns, you know?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.367
But this is a pattern I've not seen before.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.420
The large thumb, now.

21:32.500 --> 21:37.222
It means that you're strong-minded,
and you have a will not easily crossed.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.804
And this is your Mount of Venus.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.766
In a man, it means he likes the lasses,

21:44.845 --> 21:47.223
but it is a bit different for a woman.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.354
To be polite about it,

21:49.433 --> 21:52.562
your husband is not likely
to stray far from your bed.

21:58.192 --> 22:01.366
The lifeline's interrupted,

22:01.445 --> 22:04.119
all bits and pieces.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.912
The marriage line's divided.
Means two marriages.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.460
But...

22:13.916 --> 22:16.920
Most divided lines are broken.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.265
Yours is...

22:23.342 --> 22:24.594
Forked.

22:28.430 --> 22:32.185
But I suspect your ancestor had a patron.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.191
A prominent and powerful man

22:34.270 --> 22:36.523
who could protect him
from the censure of his superiors.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.699
Possibly, but it would have to
have been someone

22:38.774 --> 22:40.526
very high up in the hierarchy of the day

22:40.609 --> 22:42.236
to exert that kind of influence.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.371
The Duke of Sandringham.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.874
The Duke of Sandringham?

22:46.949 --> 22:48.201
Hold on.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.833
Wasn't Sandringham
a suspected Jacobite himself?

22:51.161 --> 22:52.834
Aye. You know, I believe you're right.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.799
And the duke died
under very suspicious circumstances

22:55.875 --> 22:57.218
just before the battle of...

22:57.293 --> 22:58.545
None of that, none of that!

22:58.627 --> 23:00.300
Stand away before you do
some permanent damage.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.847
I think we're getting somewhere at last.

23:01.922 --> 23:06.098
I'm really glad to hear it,
but I think I shall take my leave.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.019
- So soon?
- Yes.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.689
I feel a bath is in order.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.016
Aye, of course.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.693
Well, I hope you will join us
for Samhain tomorrow night.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.441
What? The pagan festival?

23:16.520 --> 23:18.443
Reverend Wakefield, you do astonish me.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.068
I love a good ghost story
as much as the next fellow.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.864
All right. Take your time, darling.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.495
- Do try to get home before the storm breaks.
- I will.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.590
<i>I'd never put any stock in superstition.</i>

23:40.669 --> 23:44.219
<i>And my Catholicism was nominal at best.</i>

23:44.298 --> 23:46.096
<i>However, I couldn't shake the feeling</i>

23:46.175 --> 23:49.349
<i>that Mrs. Graham's words
had a ring of prophecy.</i>

23:51.013 --> 23:53.391
<i>The war had taught me to cherish the present</i>

23:53.474 --> 23:56.227
<i>because tomorrow might not
ever come to pass.</i>

23:57.186 --> 23:59.564
<i>But what I didn't know at the time</i>

23:59.647 --> 24:02.617
<i>was that tomorrow
would prove less important</i>

24:02.691 --> 24:04.238
<i>than yesterday.</i>

24:10.157 --> 24:13.127
Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!

24:51.240 --> 24:54.915
Excuse me, can I help you with something?

25:19.810 --> 25:24.441
Frank, I was hoping to have the whole place
lit up by the time you got back.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.444
Darling, what's the matter?

25:32.072 --> 25:33.119
Frank?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.999
You look like you've seen a ghost.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.796
I'm not at all sure that I haven't.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.888
When he pushed past me,
he was close enough

25:47.963 --> 25:50.261
that I should have
felt him brush my sleeve as he passed,

25:50.340 --> 25:52.968
but I... I didn't.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.854
And then I turned around to say something,

25:55.929 --> 25:57.647
and he had gone.

25:57.723 --> 25:58.895
He just vanished.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.317
That's when I

26:00.392 --> 26:02.235
felt a chill down my spine.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.157
Did you have many Scots
in your charge during the wan?

26:12.321 --> 26:15.700
Yes, there was quite a few.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.999
There was one in particular.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.588
He was a piper in the Third Seaforths.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.587
He couldn't stand being stuck with a needle.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.134
It was...

26:28.003 --> 26:29.425
All right.

26:37.346 --> 26:40.395
What is it exactly, that,

26:40.474 --> 26:42.192
you're asking me, Frank?

26:43.477 --> 26:46.026
When I saw that chap staring up at you,

26:48.023 --> 26:50.071
I thought he might be
someone you had nursed.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.699
Someone who might be looking for you now

26:53.403 --> 26:54.950
to reconnect.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.706
To “reconnect?"

27:01.954 --> 27:03.877
It wouldn't be unusual.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.672
I mean, it wouldn't be surprising
if you had sought some...

27:07.751 --> 27:09.378
Comfort, or...

27:10.629 --> 27:14.759
Are you asking me if I've been unfaithful?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.055
Claire.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.720
Is that what you think of me, Frank?

27:18.595 --> 27:19.938
No, darling. No.

27:20.013 --> 27:24.189
No. All I meant was that even if you had,

27:24.351 --> 27:26.570
it will make no difference to me. I love you.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.732
And nothing you could ever do
could stop my loving you.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.827
Forgive me.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.042
Forgive me?

27:45.038 --> 27:46.255
Of course.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.164
<i>Sex was our bridge back to one another.</i>

28:18.238 --> 28:21.333
<i>The one place where we always met.</i>

28:21.408 --> 28:25.538
<i>Whatever obstacles presented
themselves during the day or night,</i>

28:25.621 --> 28:28.795
<i>we could seek out
and find each other again in bed.</i>

28:29.625 --> 28:32.048
<i>As long as we had that,</i>

28:32.127 --> 28:34.596
<i>I had faith everything would work out.</i>

28:55.484 --> 28:58.954
That reminds me, I want to set an alarm.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.326
No.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.534
I thought we weren't
setting alarms on this trip.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.085
I want to see the witches.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.666
Must I ask?

29:11.667 --> 29:14.637
Apparently,
there's a circle of standing stones

29:14.711 --> 29:16.429
on a hill just outside the village,

29:16.505 --> 29:20.601
and there's a local group
who still observe rituals there.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.644
Well, they're not actually witches.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.266
This lot are meant to be druids.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.395
Sadly, I don't think there'll be
a coven of devil-worshippers.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.397
Well, it's a pity.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.446
Cam imagine anything I'd rather do.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.568
Liar.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.905
Where will we be watching this spectacle?

29:37.067 --> 29:38.614
A place called Craigh na Dun.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.299
So, according to local folklore,

29:52.374 --> 29:54.843
these stones were carried here from Africa

29:54.918 --> 29:56.886
by a race of Celtic giants.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.887
I wasn't aware that Celts
made a lot of trips to Africa.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.718
Only the giant ones.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.560
Is that Inverness?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.186
Yes, it must be.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.312
Someone's coming.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.559
Is that Mrs. Graham?

30:53.643 --> 30:55.236
I think ii is.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.110
The Reverend's housekeeper is a witch.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.450
Not a witch. Druid, remember?

31:22.589 --> 31:25.012
<i>They should have been ridiculous,</i>

31:25.092 --> 31:26.514
<i>and perhaps they were.</i>

31:27.135 --> 31:30.139
<i>Parading in circles on top of a hill.</i>

31:30.222 --> 31:33.817
<i>But the hairs on the back of my neck
prickled at the sight,</i>

31:34.476 --> 31:36.945
<i>and some small voice inside warned me</i>

31:37.687 --> 31:39.985
<i>I wasn't supposed to be here.</i>

31:41.108 --> 31:45.989
<i>I was an unwelcome voyeur
to something ancient and powerful.</i>

34:17.639 --> 34:18.856
Wait for me!

34:18.931 --> 34:20.934
I'm caught on something.
I'll be there in a minute.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.478
Claire, someones coming.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.348
We should go.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.120
What have you got there?

35:18.199 --> 35:19.667
I'm looking for that plant.

35:19.743 --> 35:22.041
I think it's a forget-me-not,
but I'm not sure.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.622
Why don't you pop back and get it?

35:23.747 --> 35:25.966
I was considering it.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.793
Would you care to go with me?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.753
Darling, I'd love to,

35:29.836 --> 35:31.713
but I've got an appointment
with the Reverend.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.719
He found a box of materials last night.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.800
Bills of sale from Black Jack's quartermaster.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.554
That sounds terribly exciting.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.312
Are you laughing at me?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.228
Never.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.735
- Shall I meet you for dinner later?
- Yes.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.862
- Love you.
- Love you.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.115
Come here.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.436
<i>Once, traveling at night,</i>

37:47.515 --> 37:49.984
<i>I fell asleep in the passenger seat
of a moving car,</i>

37:51.770 --> 37:55.695
<i>lulled by the noise and the motion
into an illusion of serene weightlessness.</i>

37:57.275 --> 37:59.494
<i>Then the driver took a bridge too fast.</i>

38:00.403 --> 38:05.034
<i>And I woke to see the world
spinning outside the car windows,</i>

38:05.116 --> 38:08.746
<i>and the sickening sensation
of falling at high speed.</i>

38:09.537 --> 38:13.542
<i>That is as close as I can come to
describing what I experienced,</i>

38:14.876 --> 38:17.220
<i>but it falls woefully short.</i>

39:04.551 --> 39:05.803
What?

40:15.496 --> 40:17.749
<i>When confronted with the impossible,</i>

40:17.832 --> 40:19.834
<i>the rational mind will grope for the logical.</i>

40:24.839 --> 40:27.592
<i>Perhaps I had stumbled onto
the set of a cinema company</i>

40:27.675 --> 40:30.144
<i>filming a costume drama of some sort.</i>

40:47.987 --> 40:49.830
<i>But there was no logical reason</i>

40:49.906 --> 40:52.034
<i>for actors to fire live ammunition.</i>

41:46.254 --> 41:47.972
Frank?

41:48.381 --> 41:50.304
What the devil are you doing?

41:57.807 --> 41:59.104
You're not Frank.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.315
No, madam. I am not.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.447
Who the bloody hell are you?

42:10.278 --> 42:12.622
I am Jonathan Randall Esquire,

42:12.697 --> 42:14.870
Captain of His Majesty's Eighth Dragoons.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.583
At your service.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.174
Who are you?

42:31.257 --> 42:33.100
My husband is expecting me.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.270
He'll come looking for me
if I'm not back in 10 minutes.

42:35.344 --> 42:37.597
Your husband? What's his name?

42:39.182 --> 42:40.525
What is his name?

42:42.310 --> 42:45.154
- Frank.
- Frank what?

42:47.106 --> 42:49.655
Frank Beauchamp. He's a teacher.

42:50.401 --> 42:54.406
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you'
Mrs. Frank Beauchamp, a teachers wife.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.741
You must think me the fool.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.247
You'll be well advised
to tell me exactly who you are

42:59.327 --> 43:00.670
and why you're here.

43:00.787 --> 43:03.586
Madam, you'll find
my patience is not infinite.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.712
Get off me, you bastard.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.013
The speech of a lady.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.841
The language of a whore.

43:13.341 --> 43:14.843
I choose the whore.

43:20.807 --> 43:21.808
Druid!

43:21.891 --> 43:23.438
- What?
- Druid!

43:25.103 --> 43:26.355
Who are you?

43:26.437 --> 43:28.531
Where are we going? Where are we go...

43:29.649 --> 43:30.866
Over here!

43:32.193 --> 43:33.991
You men over there! Quickly!

43:39.033 --> 43:41.081
<i>I wanted it to be a dream,</i>

43:41.160 --> 43:42.753
<i>but I knew it wasn't.</i>

43:48.417 --> 43:50.294
<i>If naming else,</i>

43:50.378 --> 43:52.972
<i>my erstwhile savior fairly reeked of odors</i>

43:53.047 --> 43:56.642
<i>too foul to be part of any dream
I was likely to conjure up.</i>

44:25.746 --> 44:27.544
Let's have a look at you then, lass.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.337
I trust you're able to see me now?

44:32.420 --> 44:33.717
What's your name?

44:34.255 --> 44:37.259
<i>I decided to continue using my maiden name.</i>

44:37.341 --> 44:40.811
<i>If they intended to ransom me,
I didn't want to lead them back to Frank.</i>

44:41.262 --> 44:43.139
Claire.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.269
Claire Beauchamp.

44:44.599 --> 44:45.896
Claire Beauchamp.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.728
That's right.
And just what the hell do you think...

44:48.811 --> 44:50.028
You said you found her?

44:50.104 --> 44:51.526
Aye.

44:51.606 --> 44:54.359
She was havin' words
with a certain Captain of dragoons

44:54.442 --> 44:55.864
with whom we are acquainted.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.069
There seemed to be some question

44:57.153 --> 44:59.406
as to whether the lady
was or was not a whore.

44:59.739 --> 45:02.083
And what was the lady's position
in this discussion?

45:04.243 --> 45:05.460
I am not.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.129
We could put her to the test.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.582
I don't hold with rape.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.676
And we've not the time for it, anyway.

45:13.628 --> 45:16.632
Dougal, I've no idea
what she might be or who,

45:17.298 --> 45:19.141
but I'll stake my best shot she's not a whore.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.479
We'll puzzle it out later.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.932
We've got a good distance to go tonight.

45:26.015 --> 45:27.813
And we must do something about Jamie first.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.403
<i>Escape was my chief concern,</i>

45:30.478 --> 45:32.776
<i>but I had no idea where I was.</i>

45:32.855 --> 45:35.859
<i>And trying to find the mad back to Invemess
in the gathering darkness</i>

45:35.942 --> 45:37.660
<i>felt like a fool's errand.</i>

45:38.152 --> 45:40.280
Out o' joint, poor bugger.

45:40.363 --> 45:42.365
You can't ride with it
like that, can you, lad?

45:42.448 --> 45:44.075
Hurts bad enough sitting still.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.410
I couldna manage a horse.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.203
I don't mean to be leaving him behind.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.414
There's no help for it, then.

45:49.497 --> 45:50.999
I'll have to force the joint back.

45:51.874 --> 45:55.094
<i>The wisest course of action
would have been to keep my head down,</i>

45:55.169 --> 45:56.466
<i>my mouth shut,</i>

45:56.545 --> 45:59.765
<i>and wait for the search parties
Frank must have called out by now.</i>

46:00.341 --> 46:01.342
Here, lad.

46:12.812 --> 46:13.984
Hold him.

46:17.149 --> 46:18.196
Don't you dare!

46:19.568 --> 46:20.740
Stand aside at once.

46:21.988 --> 46:23.990
You'll break his arm if you do it like that.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.081
You have to get the bone
of the upper arm in the correct position

46:28.160 --> 46:30.333
before it slips back into joint.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.137
Hold him steady.

46:59.567 --> 47:00.614
This is the worst part.

47:17.585 --> 47:19.007
It doesn't hurt anymore!

47:19.086 --> 47:20.338
It will.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.219
It will be tender for about a week.

47:22.298 --> 47:23.595
You'll need a sling.

47:24.592 --> 47:27.596
You, fetch me a long piece of cloth or a belt.

47:28.095 --> 47:31.269
"Fetch me? she says. Do ye hear that, lads?

47:31.349 --> 47:32.692
Give her yer belt.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.532
- I'm taking a guess you've done this before.
- I'm a nurse.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.786
Not a wet nurse.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.913
You mustn't move the joint
for two or three days.

47:50.409 --> 47:53.879
When you begin to use it again,
go very slowly at first.

47:54.622 --> 47:56.875
Stop at once if it hurts,

47:57.375 --> 47:59.628
and use warm compresses on it daily.

48:00.961 --> 48:04.181
All right, how does that feel?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.810
Better. Thank ye.

48:09.553 --> 48:10.645
Can you ride?

48:11.430 --> 48:13.398
- Aye.
- Good. We're leaving.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.250
Where is it?

48:39.333 --> 48:41.381
Where's the city?
It should be visible from here.

48:42.878 --> 48:44.255
Inverness?

48:45.339 --> 48:47.091
You're looking straight at it.

48:50.261 --> 48:53.982
<i>There were no electric lights
as far as the eye could see.</i>

48:54.056 --> 48:57.777
<i>So, as much as my rational mind
rebelled against the idea,</i>

48:57.852 --> 49:01.732
<i>I knew in my heart
I was no longer in the 20th century.</i>

49:05.818 --> 49:07.195
Get yourself up.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.996
You be sure to stay close to the rest of us.

49:10.114 --> 49:13.459
And should ye try anythin' else,
I shall slit your throat for you.

49:13.534 --> 49:15.002
Do you understand me?

49:15.828 --> 49:17.546
Gimme your foot. Give it to me.

49:27.715 --> 49:28.887
Careful!

49:28.966 --> 49:30.058
What are you trying to do?

49:30.759 --> 49:33.478
I'll get my plaid loose to cover ye.

49:33.554 --> 49:34.646
You're shivering.

49:38.517 --> 49:39.939
Thank you, but I'm fine, really.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.897
You're shaking so hard,
it's making my teeth rattle.

49:43.772 --> 49:46.400
The plaid will keep us both warm,

49:46.484 --> 49:47.986
but I canna do it one-handed.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.411
Can ye reach?

50:00.915 --> 50:02.417
We don't want you to freeze before sun-up.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.844
Sun-up?

50:05.920 --> 50:07.718
You mean we'll be riding all night?

50:08.047 --> 50:09.424
All night,

50:09.548 --> 50:11.221
and the next one, too, I reckon.

50:12.927 --> 50:14.929
Fine time of year for a ride, though.

50:15.721 --> 50:16.722
Druid.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.301
You see up there?

51:33.173 --> 51:34.846
I know this place.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.887
Been through here before, have ye?

51:38.721 --> 51:39.768
Yes.

51:39.847 --> 51:41.224
The 17th and 18th centuries,

51:41.307 --> 51:43.935
you'd have often found
a British Army patrol up there.

51:45.019 --> 51:46.521
I recognize that rock.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.982
The one that looks like a cook's tail.

51:49.064 --> 51:50.737
It has a name.

51:53.402 --> 51:55.075
Cocknammon Rock.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.866
The English, they used it for ambushes!

51:59.199 --> 52:01.167
They could be lying in wait right now.

52:01.827 --> 52:04.546
It's a bonnie place
for an ambush, right enough.

52:07.041 --> 52:08.088
Dougal.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.425
Dougal. Dougal.

52:29.813 --> 52:32.657
Now, you'll be telling me
exactly how and why

52:32.733 --> 52:35.452
you come to know
there's an ambush up ahead.

52:35.527 --> 52:36.995
I don't know,

52:37.071 --> 52:38.948
but I heard the redcoats
use Cocknammon...

52:39.031 --> 52:40.078
Where did you hear?

52:42.826 --> 52:43.827
In the village.

53:03.514 --> 53:04.811
Hide yourself!

54:07.327 --> 54:08.499
Lost yer way?

54:15.836 --> 54:17.713
Hope you haven't been
misusing that shoulder.

54:19.423 --> 54:20.470
You' re hurt!

54:20.883 --> 54:23.636
This lot isn't my blood.

54:23.719 --> 54:25.016
Not much of it anyway.

54:29.183 --> 54:32.778
Dougal and the others
will be waiting further up the stream.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.732
We should go.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.781
- I'm not going with you!
- Yes, you are.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.613
What? Are you going to
cut my throat if I don't?

54:42.696 --> 54:44.164
Why, no?

54:44.907 --> 54:45.954
But...

54:46.033 --> 54:47.876
You don't look that heavy.

54:49.369 --> 54:51.087
Now if ye won't walk,

54:52.039 --> 54:54.713
I shall pick you up
and throw you over my shoulder.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.303
Do ye want me to do that?

54:59.713 --> 55:00.965
No!

55:02.591 --> 55:03.808
Well, then,

55:05.511 --> 55:07.730
I suppose that means you're coming with me.

55:21.693 --> 55:22.694
Serves you right.

55:22.778 --> 55:24.951
Probably torn muscles as well as bruising.

55:25.072 --> 55:27.746
Well, it wasn't much of a choice.

55:28.742 --> 55:29.914
If I'd not moved my shoulder,

55:29.993 --> 55:32.121
I'd never have moved
anything else ever again.

55:32.913 --> 55:35.541
I can handle a single redcoat with one hand,

55:35.624 --> 55:37.092
maybe even two.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.510
But not three.

55:39.378 --> 55:41.051
Besides, ye can fix it for me again

55:41.129 --> 55:42.426
when we get to where we're going.

55:42.506 --> 55:43.928
That's what you think.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.598
You have. Here's to you, lass.

55:46.677 --> 55:50.773
For tipping us to the villains in the rocks
and giving us a wee bit o' fun!

55:59.690 --> 56:00.987
Have a wee nip.

56:01.942 --> 56:05.287
It willna fill your belly,
but it will make ye forget you're hungry.

56:49.156 --> 56:50.328
Stop!

56:51.325 --> 56:53.202
Help! He's going over!

56:57.998 --> 56:59.420
Help me get him up!

57:00.208 --> 57:01.630
Come on.

57:02.836 --> 57:03.837
Take it easy.

57:04.671 --> 57:05.672
Easy now.

57:12.596 --> 57:13.768
Gunshot wound.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.394
The idiot could've said something.

57:15.474 --> 57:16.942
It's a clean exit.

57:17.017 --> 57:19.019
I think the round's gone
straight through the muscle.

57:19.227 --> 57:21.776
I don't think it's serious,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

57:22.564 --> 57:25.317
It'll need to be disinfected
before I can dress it properly.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.822
Disinfect?

57:28.070 --> 57:29.447
Yes, it must be cleaned of dirt

57:29.529 --> 57:30.872
to protect it from germs.

57:30.989 --> 57:32.036
Germs?

57:33.659 --> 57:35.252
Just get me some iodine.

57:38.121 --> 57:39.122
Merthiolate?

57:41.583 --> 57:42.709
Alcohol?

57:45.462 --> 57:46.884
Here you go.

57:53.804 --> 57:54.805
Welcome back.

57:55.639 --> 57:57.141
I'm all right, just a wee bit dizzy.

57:57.224 --> 57:58.521
You are not all right.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.602
Didn't you tell how badly you were bleeding?

58:00.686 --> 58:02.063
You're lucky you're not dead,

58:02.145 --> 58:04.113
brawling and fighting
and throwing yourself off horses.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.443
All right, I need a sterile bandage

58:07.526 --> 58:09.153
and some clean cloth.

58:13.907 --> 58:15.784
Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.

58:24.543 --> 58:25.544
Hold still.

58:28.630 --> 58:29.847
Easy.

58:32.426 --> 58:33.518
Lift him up.

58:39.641 --> 58:42.520
Come on, you goddamn bloody bastard.

58:42.602 --> 58:45.572
I've never heard a woman
use such language in my life.

58:45.647 --> 58:47.741
Your husband should tan your hide
for ye, woman.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.739
St. Paul says, "Let a woman be silent, and..."

58:49.818 --> 58:52.992
You can mind your own bloody
business and so can St. Paul!

58:58.618 --> 59:00.837
And if you move so much as a single muscle

59:00.912 --> 59:02.038
while I'm tying this bandage,

59:02.122 --> 59:03.874
I'll bloody throttle you.

59:03.957 --> 59:06.710
Threats, is it?

59:06.793 --> 59:08.386
And after I shared my drink with ye.

59:08.462 --> 59:10.635
We have 15 miles to go yet.

59:10.714 --> 59:13.058
Five hours, at the least, if not seven.

59:13.133 --> 59:15.511
We'll stay long enough for ye
to stem the bleeding and dress his wound.

59:15.594 --> 59:16.811
No more than that.

59:19.306 --> 59:20.728
He needs rest.

59:22.309 --> 59:24.277
- Did you hear me?
- Randall...

59:28.565 --> 59:30.613
The officer ye encountered,

59:32.986 --> 59:34.613
he won't give up so easily.

59:35.697 --> 59:37.495
He commands the redcoats hereabouts

59:39.076 --> 59:42.046
and he's sent patrols out
in every direction by now.

59:43.789 --> 59:45.336
We canna stay here long.

59:46.291 --> 59:48.009
You know Randall?

59:48.085 --> 59:49.302
Black Jack Randall, that is?

59:51.671 --> 59:52.672
Aye.

59:56.051 --> 01:00:00.397
I won't risk you or anyone else
being taken prisoner by that man.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:04.018
If ye canna fix me up well enough to ride,

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.354
you'll be leaving me here
with a loaded pistol

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.696
so I may determine my own fate.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.986
You might've well told me you were shot

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.697
before you fell off the horse.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.290
Didn't hurt much at the time.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.917
Does it hurt now?

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:24.503
Aye.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:26.711
Good.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.217
That's about all I can do.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.586
The rest is up to you.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:48.899
Thank you, Sassenach.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:51.315
Truly.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.491
All right, on your horse, soldier.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.073
<i>Castle Leach.</i>

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:37.991
<i>I'd been here with Frank two days age.</i>

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:41.160
<i>Or was that in the future?</i>

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.745
<i>How could I remember
something that hadn't happened yet?</i>

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.502
<i>So far, I'd been assaulted,</i>

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.930
<i>threatened, kidnapped and nearly raped.</i>

01:01:57.005 --> 01:02:01.431
<i>And somehow,
I knew that my journey had only just begun.</i>
