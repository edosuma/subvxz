WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:02.334
This isn't a joke, joe.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.770
We're running out of time.
What is the plan?

00:04.772 --> 00:05.971
        Joe: We're gonna show
        the world the truth.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.340
        Religion is not
        about love or charity.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.775
            It is about blood.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.643
    Kingston: There's a serpent
        in our garden,

00:11.645 --> 00:14.113
One who seduces our troubled
    brothers and sisters

00:14.115 --> 00:15.647
        With his lies.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.349
    I'm speaking to you,
        joe carroll.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.618
    Joe: If the good preacher
        wants a holy war,

00:19.620 --> 00:22.287
    Then, by hell,
    we'll give him one.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.689
        I think
        kingston tanner's son

00:23.691 --> 00:25.124
            May be joe's
            next target.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.291
Mike:
The televangelist's son?

00:26.293 --> 00:27.326
                    Yeah.
Where is he?

00:27.328 --> 00:28.527
            Northfield college.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.695
Joe's people
attacked the college,

00:29.697 --> 00:30.796
Took preston tanner.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.131
Ryan is following
them to joe.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.465
                I just want
                to help ryan.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.833
Claire: Ms. Cooke,
if you want to help ryan,

00:34.835 --> 00:36.168
Help me.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.803
                Claire matthews?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.471
    Carrie: Lily gray
    has taken center stage

00:39.473 --> 00:41.540
        By impersonating
    carroll and his followers

00:41.542 --> 00:43.342
        In order to free
        her imprisoned son.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.544
Joe: You clever,
little viper.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.712
            This is the phone
            they used

00:46.714 --> 00:48.147
            To contact
            lily gray.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.715
            Have cyber forensics
            look into it.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.550
Lily: You weren't the only one
    to hurt me, ryan.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.319
    Say hello to your son,
        richard.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.855
        You take from me,
        I take from you.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.157
            Ryan: We're gonna
            find lily gray

00:58.159 --> 00:59.324
            And joe carroll,
            and then

00:59.326 --> 01:00.726
            After all this
            is over,

01:00.728 --> 01:02.361
            We're gonna
            go have a life.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.063
            Joe: Welcome
            to korban, preston.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.398
            It's time
            for you to pay

01:06.400 --> 01:08.967
            For the sins
            of your father.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.005
            Where's jimmy?

01:13.007 --> 01:15.007
            He's supposed
            to be down here.

01:15.009 --> 01:17.176
        Jimmy!

01:17.178 --> 01:18.343
Don't worry
about him.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.312
Joe is waiting.
Here. Help me out.

01:30.023 --> 01:33.425
        Come on.
        Get out of there.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.027
            Whoa ho ho ho!

01:35.029 --> 01:37.062
        Where you going, huh?

01:37.064 --> 01:39.598
Let's go for a walk.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.740
        [gun cocks]

01:48.742 --> 01:51.210
                    Freeze!

01:51.212 --> 01:53.278
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.047
            Take it easy, man.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.548
Hey, what is this place?

01:56.550 --> 01:58.450
                    Uh!

02:03.756 --> 02:05.958
        Rrgh!

02:27.480 --> 02:29.448
You want to do what?
                        I know.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.583
    It sounds insane,
    but I can lure joe out.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.118
        I know what to say.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.953
And you want to do this
on the air in an interview.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.655
            Yeah. That's
            all kinds of crazy.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.090
    It'll
    throw him.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.658
    Whatever he's doing,
    it'll throw him.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.326
    It'll get him off his game.
    I'm his weakness.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.162
        If he thinks I'm alive,
        he's gonna crack.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.930
Anything on ryan?

02:44.932 --> 02:47.299
                We found
                ryan's phone

02:47.301 --> 02:49.001
            A few miles away
            from the college.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.602
He was headed north
and after joe's people

02:50.604 --> 02:52.304
And preston tanner,
but there were

02:52.306 --> 02:54.139
7 interchanges
within 45 miles.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.774
That's a wide
search area.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.110
    You faked your death
for a reason, ms. Matthews.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.845
        You have a son
        to consider.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.847
            I'm doing this
            for my son.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.682
            This is the only
            card I have to play.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.984
            I can get to him.
            Put me on live.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.686
            I can speak to him
            directly.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.788
And I'm not so sure you're
making a rational decision.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.290
This is an emotional
ordeal, ms. Matthews.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.292
    Listen. I'm gonna do this
    with or without you.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.661
        I can put it online
    all by myself if I want to.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.162
        Don't be foolish,
        ms. Cooke.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.463
        I mean, think of
        the sequel you can write

03:18.465 --> 03:19.831
        After all this is over.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.366
        Joe is gonna send
        a big message,

03:21.368 --> 03:22.801
        And a lot of people
        are gonna die,

03:22.803 --> 03:24.703
    And I would think you guys
    would want to stop it.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.873
Ok. Let me talk
to my producer.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.542
It would be best
to do it here.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.010
I can have a small crew
put together.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.812
I'll need
a little time.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.014
Here's my card.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.717
            You can contact
            claire through me.

03:46.492 --> 03:50.195
        Hey, you're not
        really gonna do this.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.830
It's insane.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.699
I'm not putting her
on television.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.201
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from ryan.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.570
Keep her off the internet,
take away her cell phone--

03:58.572 --> 03:59.905
She's not
thinking clearly--

03:59.907 --> 04:01.540
            No. I know.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.942
And find ryan,
please.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.883
    You're wrong for wanting
        to stop me.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.352
    I can find joe, mike.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.020
            I'd like to focus
            on finding ryan.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.356
    [cell phone rings]

04:17.358 --> 04:20.358
            [beep]
    hello?

04:20.361 --> 04:23.228
    Yeah.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.696
Ok. Great. Thanks.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.365
            [beep]

04:26.367 --> 04:29.101
Kingston tanner
heard from joe.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.704
Jenny:
Don't kill me, please!

04:32.706 --> 04:34.273
            Quiet,
            you stupid bitch.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.908
Please, god, don't kill her.
    Don't kill her.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.045
                        [slice]
    no! Don't. Don't.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.447
        Hello, pastor,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.283
        Or may I call you
            kingston?

04:44.285 --> 04:46.451
I do feel, given the intimacy
    of this moment,

04:46.453 --> 04:49.888
        We should be
    on first-name terms.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.224
    By the time you see this,
        I will have spent

04:52.226 --> 04:55.260
        Some quality time
        with your son.

04:55.262 --> 04:59.731
        I have a lesson
about the nature of true faith.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.566
    Actually, it's not
    just a lesson for him,

05:01.568 --> 05:04.436
    But you, your followers,

05:04.438 --> 05:07.673
    And the entire world.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.246
How did the tape
arrive?

05:14.248 --> 05:16.315
One of the pastor's bodyguards
    found a flash drive

05:16.317 --> 05:18.917
        In an envelope
    just outside his gate.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.152
Cyber team?
Forensics?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.153
            It's in the works.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.088
Excuse me. You--
I know you.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.590
You're agent...
Weston.

05:25.592 --> 05:28.093
You've been part of this
for a long time.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.262
        Sorry, sir,
        about your son.

05:30.264 --> 05:33.598
I'm sorry
about your father.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.535
My condolences
to you and your family.

05:38.304 --> 05:42.841
Dear god,
please bless this man.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.943
Please bring him comfort
in his suffering.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.679
Please ease his pain
so that he may go forth

05:47.681 --> 05:50.349
And do your bidding.
Amen.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.617
We shall respond to
joe carroll's message

05:52.619 --> 05:54.019
Right away.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.620
        I don't think that's
        a good idea, pastor.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.457
    No, no. This is a war.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.158
        This is a war
        on my faith.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.327
    Showing joe carroll
    that my trust in god

06:02.329 --> 06:03.628
    Is stronger than ever,

06:03.630 --> 06:05.364
    That is how we will
    bring preston home.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.531
                Engaging carroll
                could mean

06:06.533 --> 06:07.799
                More violence
                to preston

06:07.801 --> 06:10.802
                And others.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.371
Now, my son and I
have had our differences,

06:12.373 --> 06:14.806
But he's just a boy,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.308
Just a child
trying to find his way,

06:16.310 --> 06:18.677
And he will need
the prayers of others.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.645
        You don't have
        to go on tv to pray.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.814
Of course not.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.716
I'll abide
by your wishes

06:24.718 --> 06:26.451
As long as
the good lord allows.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.284
            Hey, why aren't you
            in your robe?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.256
                    Uh!

07:12.198 --> 07:15.934
    Tilda: Everyone please
    take your places.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.275
We're ready.
                    Great.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.543
            I'll let joe know.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.546
Emma, when do we leave?
Do you know?

07:27.548 --> 07:28.747
            The large group
            will be leaving

07:28.749 --> 07:30.115
            Shortly after
            the ceremony,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.217
            Then joe and
            the inner circle

07:32.219 --> 07:33.952
            First thing
            in the morning.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.887
This is our final
mission, isn't it?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.290
        Yes, tilda. This will be
        our final mission.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.958
            Are you ready
            for it?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.461
Yes, but the others--

07:42.463 --> 07:44.896
We've never done anything
this big before.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.132
        That's why joe needs you
        to lead the charge.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.001
            He has faith
            in you, tilda. Come.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.245
    Man: Hooray for joe!

08:00.247 --> 08:01.980
                Woman:
                Hooray, joe!

08:01.982 --> 08:05.650
    [cheering and applause]

08:26.973 --> 08:30.108
            Welcome!

08:30.110 --> 08:34.044
    Welcome, my chosen ones.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.518
    Joe: Your actions
    are being talked about

08:39.520 --> 08:43.121
    Across the nation,

08:43.123 --> 08:46.791
    But tonight as we prepare
            to embark

08:46.793 --> 08:51.630
    On our most important
    mission to date,

08:51.632 --> 08:55.367
        We will rejoice!

08:55.369 --> 08:57.936
    [cheering and applause]

09:10.550 --> 09:12.717
I'm so sorry, joe.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
I promise I'll be
better from now on.

09:14.721 --> 09:18.223
            Shush. It's fine.
            It's fine, um...

09:18.225 --> 09:20.158
                    Courtney.
Courtney.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.860
            Courtney.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.995
            Courtney.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.731
    Courtney, you are here

09:26.733 --> 09:30.835
    For a much greater purpose.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.837
    Courtney, meet preston.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.840
    This fine, young man

09:35.842 --> 09:41.012
    Is going to deliver you
    from your suffering,

09:41.014 --> 09:44.849
        For he is going
        to send you home!

09:44.851 --> 09:49.688
    [cheering and applause]

09:49.690 --> 09:51.690
            I don't understand.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.758
            What is it
            you want me to do?

09:57.563 --> 09:58.930
    [cheering and applause]

10:03.269 --> 10:07.939
    I want your devotion,
        preston.

10:11.110 --> 10:15.246
    I want preston to show us

10:15.248 --> 10:21.219
    That his father's words
    are a web of lies,

10:21.221 --> 10:25.256
        That his father's
        abuse of power

10:25.258 --> 10:30.595
And his rampant profiteering
    is far from godly,

10:30.597 --> 10:33.064
        But death--

10:33.066 --> 10:35.900
    Death is necessary.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.436
    [cheering and applause]

10:38.438 --> 10:41.239
    Joe: It is not good.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.775
        It is not evil.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.911
    It is only inevitable.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.213
[whimpers]

10:49.915 --> 10:53.618
    Preston: I have no idea
    what you're talking about.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.755
        I won't kill her.

10:56.757 --> 11:03.328
Preston, blood
must be spilled here

11:03.330 --> 11:09.434
So that courtney
can go home.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.002
        Man: Home!

11:11.004 --> 11:16.107
There is no wrong
in sacrifice.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.444
There is no redemption
without blood,

11:19.446 --> 11:22.313
No redemption
without blood.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.783
    All: No redemption
    without blood.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.318
No redemption without blood.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.021
        No redemption
        without blood.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.624
No redemption without blood.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.160
        No redemption
        without blood.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.328
No redemption without blood.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.964
        No redemption
        without blood.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.300
No redemption without blood.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.335
        No redemption
        without blood.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.705
    [cheering and applause]

11:46.707 --> 11:50.008
            Preston!

11:50.010 --> 11:53.311
            Preston!

11:53.313 --> 11:58.216
    It is time for you
    to make a choice.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.818
            Join me.

11:59.820 --> 12:05.323
    Join us as we wage
    our holy war

12:05.325 --> 12:09.327
    And give this girl
    the salvation

12:09.329 --> 12:13.832
    She so richly deserves
    so that her blood

12:13.834 --> 12:17.402
    Can serve as a message
        to your father

12:17.404 --> 12:22.340
    That life is sacrifice.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.842
            [gunshot]

12:23.844 --> 12:25.810
        [all screaming]

12:28.080 --> 12:29.314
Traitor!

12:37.423 --> 12:40.191
                    Robert:
                    You hit?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.761
        No. I'm ok.
What the hell was that about?

12:42.763 --> 12:44.863
                I think we've
                got a problem.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.599
Oh, yes, clearly.

12:56.408 --> 13:01.212
    Alistair, why don't we
    have a location yet?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.081
    You said the number
joe called me from was enough,

13:03.083 --> 13:04.282
        That your people
        could find it.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.450
                My people
                are tracing it,

13:05.452 --> 13:07.085
            But they have to
            do it undetected.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.219
            May take
            a little time,

13:08.221 --> 13:09.554
            But they'll
            get an address.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.256
        Are you ready to move
        when we get the call?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.158
Of course I'm ready.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.127
            Are you and luke
            packed?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.395
    Yes.
                Good.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.063
            You can help me with
            the bags, please.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.266
Why don't we just
leave the country?

13:21.268 --> 13:22.600
Mom, we're together.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.235
We're a family again.
Let's just go.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.405
            And we will as soon
            as we're done here.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.974
Why do you have
to get joe carroll?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.576
I don't want to lose
anyone else.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.778
I don't want
to lose you, mother.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.647
            My love,
            you're so sensitive,

13:35.649 --> 13:37.649
        But I really must insist
        that you man up.

13:37.651 --> 13:41.953
        This whiny-child routine
        has lost its appeal.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.822
                Listen.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.591
            Joe carroll must pay
            for what he's done.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.092
            Now go make sure
            luke is ready to go.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.427
            We'll have
            to move quickly.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.662
            Go on.
            Get the bags.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.606
Did you catch him?

14:01.608 --> 14:03.975
        We're still looking.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.811
You promised me
that we had isolated

14:06.813 --> 14:09.781
Every disgruntled
member.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.150
                It--

14:12.152 --> 14:14.786
            It might not be
            a korban member.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.855
        No?

14:16.857 --> 14:18.957
Um...

14:18.959 --> 14:22.493
    When we were leaving
the college, we saw ryan hardy.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.630
Oh. Ha ha ha!

14:25.632 --> 14:28.633
And he followed you
here, yeah,

14:28.635 --> 14:30.802
And you waited

14:30.804 --> 14:34.205
Until now before
telling me this?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.841
            We were
            so careful, joe,

14:36.843 --> 14:39.477
            But, yes,
            it might be him.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.346
            I don't know.
            I can't be sure.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.514
        He was wearing a mask
        and a robe, and--

14:43.516 --> 14:45.216
    We need to leave now.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.718
    If ryan hardy is here,
        we're done.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.386
        The fbi will be
        right behind him.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.321
    Look. Jason comes
    from around here.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.656
    He has an empty home
    two hours away

14:51.658 --> 14:53.024
    That micah used
    to use as a retreat.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.826
    I think we need to get
    you there for protection.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.227
                No, no, no. No.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.530
            What you need to do

14:59.532 --> 15:02.500
            Is find ryan hardy

15:02.502 --> 15:05.403
            And bring him
            to me now.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.074
    Good.

15:13.712 --> 15:16.514
Joe, you need
to think about this.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.182
            We need to go.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.884
            Don't let ryan
            get to you.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.519
            We have to be smart.
Thank you.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.054
Thank you, emma,

15:23.056 --> 15:25.924
For your
unsolicited advice,

15:25.926 --> 15:28.526
But we will
hold our course.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.728
        We have kingston turner
        to deal with.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.364
        So send the troops out
        without delay,

15:33.366 --> 15:35.600
            And we will
            follow shortly.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.271
        You are not
        thinking clearly.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.373
    The fbi could be storming
    this place any second.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.043
        This could be the end.

15:45.045 --> 15:48.446
Then it ends, emma.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.223
            Get on your knees.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.893
Jenny: Don't kill me!
                        [slice]

16:01.895 --> 16:04.095
Anything
on the video?

16:04.097 --> 16:07.732
    Not enough to work with.
    Forensics were inconclusive.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.967
            What about ryan?

16:08.969 --> 16:10.301
Still nothing.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.402
                Claire?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.603
Still at ryan's
apartment.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.272
We blocked
her internet access.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.740
                Mm.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.742
How are you doing?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.978
            I suck.
            How you doing?

16:19.980 --> 16:22.280
    Same.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.582
About what
that preacher said

16:24.584 --> 16:27.919
With the whole
prayer--

16:27.921 --> 16:29.954
        That was weird,
            huh?

16:29.956 --> 16:32.590
                No. It wasn't.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.593
            What's weird, mike,

16:35.595 --> 16:37.929
            Is, your father
            just died,

16:37.931 --> 16:40.264
            And you're
            not grieving.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.433
            So answer
            the question again.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.635
            How are you?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.270
I told you.
It sucks.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.506
        This coffee sucks.
        Give me a little more.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.645
I'm not running
from it, max.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.782
It's there
all the time.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.952
This is all a distraction
just to make it bearable.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.454
            And you're not on
            some revenge mission

17:03.456 --> 17:05.690
            To get lily gray?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.791
            Killing her isn't
            gonna fix anything.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.292
            You know that.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.928
        [beep beep beep]

17:16.035 --> 17:18.301
Task force got something
on the phone

17:18.304 --> 17:19.804
We took from
lily gray's hired gun.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.372
                Yeah?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.340
Decklan made two calls
to a burner phone,

17:23.343 --> 17:25.977
One pinged to a cell tower
near a hotel.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.979
Staff there confirm
two people fitting lily

17:27.981 --> 17:30.148
And mark's description left
just after luke's escape.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.816
            Hey, what about
            the second call?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.818
Pinged to a cell tower
in suburban new jersey.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.553
Looking for
property records.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.622
            It's clarke. Yeah?

17:39.491 --> 17:41.826
Hey, what you said.
Found a house in new jersey.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.561
        They found lily gray.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.430
        Ok. We're on our way.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.805
Robert: Over here!

18:38.584 --> 18:40.618
                    Uh!
        Oof!

18:40.620 --> 18:41.619
    Uh!

18:46.391 --> 18:48.226
Where's joe sending
his cult?

18:48.228 --> 18:49.227
            I'm not telling you
            anything.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.561
Then you're useless.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.562
            Don't, don't,
            don't, don't!

18:51.564 --> 18:52.630
        Somewhere in new york.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.065
            That's all I know,
            I swear.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.734
What's the plan?
What are they gonna do?

18:56.736 --> 18:57.902
            I don't know.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.070
What is the target?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.471
        Only the chosen know.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.240
            I wasn't chosen.
            I don't know.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.643
    Robert, on radio:
    Joe, we found ryan hardy.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.078
            He's here.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.746
Joe, on radio:
Is he alone?

19:08.748 --> 19:12.083
                I think so.
                I can end this.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.818
                If I find him,
                can I kill him?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.787
No, no.
Bring him to me.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.456
You understand?

19:18.458 --> 19:21.058
        Yes. I understand.
        I'll take care of it.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.799
            [gunshot]

19:28.801 --> 19:29.934
            What are you doing?

19:29.936 --> 19:30.935
            I said I didn't
            know anything.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.837
    Ryan: Shut up!

19:32.839 --> 19:35.239
Drop it,
ryan!

19:40.812 --> 19:42.213
Take him.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.286
                    We got you,
                    bitch.

19:48.288 --> 19:51.022
        Yeah. You got me.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.694
We got ryan hardy.
We're bringing him in.

20:16.515 --> 20:21.719
Man: Nothing here.
Guys, it's clear. Clear.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.823
    Clarke: We got a body.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.326
    She's been identified
    as mandy lang,

20:28.328 --> 20:30.194
        Arkansas girl
    linked to joe carroll.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.729
                Wait a minute.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.064
    If mandy is with joe,
why is her body here with lily?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.065
            There's bad blood

20:34.067 --> 20:35.533
            Between joe
            and lily now.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.034
        Joe wasn't interested
        in her clan of psychos.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.170
They kill mandy
to get revenge.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.571
    Sir...
                Yeah?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.173
We got I.D.S on the people
that were in the house--

20:42.175 --> 20:44.008
Lily gray and
the twins luke and mark

20:44.010 --> 20:46.244
And a known merc by the name
of alistair duncan.

20:46.246 --> 20:49.046
    Thank you. Alistair duncan.
    What do we got on him?

20:49.048 --> 20:52.917
Fought in uganda,
nigeria, pakistan.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.552
He's got several
known aliases--

20:54.554 --> 20:56.520
Brian bellnap,
henry fortner.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.556
Fortner. He recently
used a credit card

20:58.558 --> 21:00.024
Under the name
fortner.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.692
        "golden driver
        car rentals."

21:01.694 --> 21:03.060
        Rented a car
        yesterday.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.562
                Car rentals
                mean gps.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.531
        I'll get a judge to
        issue a subpoena asap.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.234
                What is joe
                doing, huh?

21:10.236 --> 21:12.570
            I don't understand
            what is happening.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.705
            Why doesn't joe
            just kill ryan?

21:14.707 --> 21:17.108
Joe loses the ability
to think clearly around ryan.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.576
There's some weird
thing between them.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.044
            Yeah. I know
            their history.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.113
            All the more reason
            for him to kill him.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.881
Jason: Security cameras
are clear.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.216
No one is with him
that I can tell.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.884
            Mm, great,
            for 5 more minutes.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.220
            Emma, we got to get
            out of here.

21:29.222 --> 21:30.588
            The others will be
            in new york soon.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.723
            We got to catch up.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.558
            Well, is the plan
            even still on?

21:34.560 --> 21:38.596
I don't know.
Stop asking me questions.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.899
        This is what happened
        last year, isn't it,

21:41.901 --> 21:44.568
            With his wife,
            his son,

21:44.570 --> 21:46.704
        With ryan hardy, huh?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.808
            Joe fell apart,
            didn't he?

22:09.328 --> 22:12.663
    Oh...

22:15.467 --> 22:18.469
    Well...

22:18.471 --> 22:22.173
Oh, this is splendid.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.644
I've missed you, ryan.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.112
            You, too, buddy.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.448
Oh, please.
Don't deflect with humor.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.017
I know you've
missed me, too.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.019
I take it
you came alone.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.787
            Maybe, maybe not.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.290
Ha ha!
Always the maverick.

22:39.292 --> 22:41.158
Ha ha! No.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.660
You definitely
came alone.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.128
Otherwise,
I'd be dead by now.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.463
            You will be soon.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.631
You really that determined
to kill me, ryan,

22:47.633 --> 22:49.500
After all that we've
been through together?

22:49.502 --> 22:52.703
I thought you and I
were a pair.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.005
        Yeah. You're right.
        I wouldn't dream of it.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.841
        You can untie me, even.
        I'll be good.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.543
Ha ha ha!
Funny. Ha ha ha!

22:59.545 --> 23:01.679
    Hmm...

23:01.681 --> 23:05.149
No. You needn't
trouble yourself, ryan.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.986
I'm pretty sure that
my days are numbered,

23:08.988 --> 23:12.323
No, but it does hurt
that you can't quite see

23:12.325 --> 23:15.860
How much you need me.

23:15.862 --> 23:19.397
Seems you don't
appreciate

23:19.399 --> 23:21.832
All I am to you.

23:21.834 --> 23:25.002
            Well, I promise you,
            once you're dead,

23:25.004 --> 23:27.671
            I'll sort it all out

23:27.673 --> 23:29.373
            In therapy
            or something.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.842
Ha ha!
                So...

23:31.844 --> 23:33.844
            What's
            the big finish?

23:33.846 --> 23:35.846
            Sounds like you got
            some epic ending

23:35.848 --> 23:37.681
            Involving
            kingston tanner.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.049
Yes. Yes.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.419
Indeed, I have moved on
from the macabre

23:41.421 --> 23:45.055
Of edgar allen poe
and have turned

23:45.057 --> 23:47.558
To an altogether
more horrific

23:47.560 --> 23:50.861
Piece of fiction--
the bible.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.530
                Oh.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.064
            Are you sending
            a message to god

23:54.066 --> 23:55.232
            That you're coming?

23:55.234 --> 23:56.400
            Because
            I don't think

23:56.402 --> 23:57.735
            That's where
            you're headed.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.537
Ha ha ha!

23:59.539 --> 24:02.039
I've missed us, ryan.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.209
I really have
missed us.

24:05.211 --> 24:09.079
You have no idea

24:09.081 --> 24:11.916
What I've planned,
have you?

24:11.918 --> 24:14.051
            I know it's not
            about the bible

24:14.053 --> 24:15.920
            And god.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.055
        You're just using
        religion as an excuse

24:18.057 --> 24:20.090
To glorify
your nature, right?

24:20.092 --> 24:22.460
I mean, you're more
interested in getting

24:22.462 --> 24:24.261
Into the psychos
hall of fame

24:24.263 --> 24:26.230
Because--
let's face it--

24:26.232 --> 24:29.366
What else is there
for you now?

24:32.404 --> 24:37.107
Infamy will ensure
I live forever.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.809
    Heh.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.980
            You're a brilliant
            man, joe.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.582
            You truly are.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.251
            You're a brilliant
            teacher,

24:47.253 --> 24:50.921
            But you can't see
            yourself, can you?

24:50.923 --> 24:53.090
            Your psychopathy,
            your mental illness,

24:53.092 --> 24:55.759
            Your need to kill
            are all overshadowed

24:55.761 --> 24:59.597
            By your narcissism.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.665
    Oof...

25:01.667 --> 25:06.504
            It controls you,
            and it will end you.

25:06.506 --> 25:10.107
Oh, real friends

25:10.109 --> 25:12.443
Are able to speak

25:12.445 --> 25:15.279
The harshest of truths.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.281
            I'm not your friend.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.483
Oh, yes.

25:19.485 --> 25:22.186
Yes, you are, ryan.

25:22.188 --> 25:26.490
Now, when
I look at you,

25:26.492 --> 25:29.460
I see myself,

25:29.462 --> 25:34.164
And you reflect
a part of me

25:34.166 --> 25:37.201
That I only see
when I'm in your presence.

25:37.203 --> 25:42.206
Does that sound
familiar to you?

25:42.208 --> 25:45.442
No. You're
my best friend, ryan.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.647
Listen. We're gonna have
to pick this up later.

25:49.649 --> 25:52.550
Some much to do,
so little time to do it in.

25:52.552 --> 25:55.352
I think you're really
going to enjoy

25:55.354 --> 25:58.522
My next parlor trick.

25:58.524 --> 26:01.125
Tsk tsk tsk.
Would you mind?

26:11.870 --> 26:13.170
        Kingston:
    Thank you for coming out

26:13.172 --> 26:15.573
    On this day of tragedy.

26:15.575 --> 26:19.410
    I stand before you today
        a broken man.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.512
    As you may have heard,

26:21.514 --> 26:24.014
    There was an attack
    on my son's college.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.250
        Many were killed,

26:26.252 --> 26:29.486
        And my son preston
        was kidnapped--

26:31.189 --> 26:32.690
        [clears throat]

26:32.692 --> 26:34.758
    Kidnapped by joe carroll.

26:37.896 --> 26:41.031
    Joe: Now, would you
    have them kneel

26:41.033 --> 26:43.434
    Facing each other
    between the two of us?

26:43.436 --> 26:45.135
        Thank you.

26:47.238 --> 26:51.241
        May I introduce
    my dear friend ryan hardy?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.444
        Oh, the camera.
    Emma, where is the camera?

26:53.446 --> 26:54.712
    We should be filming this.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.880
I have it.
            Ah, thank you.

26:56.882 --> 26:59.049
Joe, please--
                    just--

26:59.051 --> 27:01.619
                This will be
                very quick, hmm?

27:03.221 --> 27:07.958
    Kingston: Joe carroll
is the very epitome of evil,

27:07.960 --> 27:11.228
And though we walk in the shadow
    of the valley of death,

27:11.230 --> 27:13.430
    I shall fear no evil,

27:13.432 --> 27:16.967
For god's promises are rich,

27:16.969 --> 27:19.236
    Wonderful to behold,

27:19.238 --> 27:22.606
    And so I say to you,
        joe carroll,

27:22.608 --> 27:24.908
        Spawn of satan,

27:24.910 --> 27:27.911
    You will not be victorious.

27:27.913 --> 27:30.948
    Now please join us
        in prayer

27:30.950 --> 27:32.983
        As we ask god...

27:34.152 --> 27:37.921
    To bring my son home.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.858
    Joe: Now, preston...

27:42.961 --> 27:46.263
    What is your decision?

27:46.265 --> 27:49.433
    It's a very simple choice.

27:49.435 --> 27:54.938
    One of you must die.

27:54.940 --> 27:58.275
    So what will you do,
        my son?

27:58.277 --> 28:01.111
        Will you honor
    your father's doctrine

28:01.113 --> 28:05.315
    Of "thou shalt not kill"
    when it really matters,

28:05.317 --> 28:07.317
    Or will you save yourself
    and show the world

28:07.319 --> 28:11.789
    That deep down,
    we are all savages?

28:11.791 --> 28:14.024
    It's very dramatic,
    this, isn't it?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.794
Or you could
kill me,

28:16.796 --> 28:19.463
Let that be
the message.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.932
    Eh, it's not an option.

28:27.639 --> 28:34.812
        Preston,
    your answer, please.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.181
        Please, please,
        don't make me do this.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.482
            Please don't
            make me.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.484
Joe, joe,
don't do this.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.352
        You just
    keep talking, ryan.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.721
        Now...

28:45.390 --> 28:48.726
I can kill you,

28:48.728 --> 28:53.030
Or you can kill
courtney, hmm?

28:53.032 --> 28:54.832
    Hmm?

28:54.834 --> 28:57.668
What will you do,
my son, hmm?

28:57.670 --> 29:01.338
Who is going
to die today?

29:01.340 --> 29:04.541
            Ryan: Preston,
            don't do it.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.176
            Don't do it.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.846
            He's not
            gonna kill you.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.014
        You're no leverage
        for him if you're dead.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.883
    Oh...

29:12.885 --> 29:15.085
Oh, that's a decision,
isn't it--

29:15.087 --> 29:17.354
Listen to the man
in the chair

29:17.356 --> 29:20.624
Or the man with
the big knife, hmm?

29:24.362 --> 29:26.864
                I won't do it.

29:26.866 --> 29:31.301
    Oh, well, your choice.

29:35.406 --> 29:37.374
                Please, please
                don't do it.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.942
                Please, please!

29:38.944 --> 29:42.112
Do you really want
to die today, preston?

29:42.114 --> 29:46.216
    Huh?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.451
    Hmm?

29:49.387 --> 29:50.788
                    Please, no.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.559
                Courtney: No.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.462
No! Oh!
                        No.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.798
        There it is--

30:00.800 --> 30:02.633
        The truth.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.805
                Please don't.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.675
                    No.

30:14.245 --> 30:19.082
        Ryan: Preston,
        don't do it. No.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.417
I'm so sorry.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.486
            No. I'm not ready.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.755
            Please, not me.

30:24.757 --> 30:26.423
God, forgive me.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.126
        Oh, no, no, no.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.961
                    No!

    Of the valley of death,
    I shall fear no evil,

30:56.856 --> 31:00.324
For god's promises are rich
    and wonderful...

31:00.326 --> 31:01.792
                I see he didn't
                keep his word.

31:01.794 --> 31:02.993
    Shocker.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.494
    I'm following the gps
    in the vehicle

31:04.496 --> 31:06.129
That alistair duncan rented,
    and--guess what--

31:06.131 --> 31:08.465
    It's 30 miles north
of where we lost ryan's phone.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.467
            Lily is not trying
            to get away.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.369
            She's going
            after joe.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.838
Which means ryan could be
right in the middle of it.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.473
                All right.
                We got to move.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.676
        I got a chopper
        on the way.

Carrie, I'm sorry. It's claire.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.053
        I'm calling
    from ryan's phone.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.555
    Claire.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.490
            I never heard
            from you.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.492
Claire, I can't
interview you.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.660
            Yeah.
            I realize that,

31:36.662 --> 31:38.328
            But you have
            to do something

31:38.330 --> 31:40.898
            If you care
            about ryan.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.833
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can help you.

31:42.835 --> 31:45.335
            That's fine.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.737
            There are dozens
            of other reporters

            take my call.

    Wait.

            I'm gonna kill you.

32:39.558 --> 32:43.060
You keep saying
that, ryan,

32:43.062 --> 32:47.064
And you can no more
kill me than I you.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.967
Don't you get it?

32:49.969 --> 32:53.470
            If I die, you die.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.758
            The target
            is half a mile east.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.159
            We've got two men
            inside,

33:16.161 --> 33:17.928
        And they've got eyes on
        two or 3 dozen people.

33:17.930 --> 33:19.296
            It's some sort
            of religious camp,

33:19.298 --> 33:20.464
            But they're armed.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.598
            You stay here
            with them, james.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.766
            I'll keep you
            updated.

33:22.768 --> 33:23.967
Lily: I don't care
who you kill,

33:23.969 --> 33:25.836
But bring joe to me.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.771
He's mine.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.107
                Let's move!
                Let's move.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.508
I want to go.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.010
            Oh, no, sweetie.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.445
        You're not up for it.
        You're still healing.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.514
        You'll stay here
        with me, both of you.

in the vehicle.

We're ready
to go.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.696
            We have a problem.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.131
            We got two vehicles
            at the front gate.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.165
        Fbi?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.833
They could be.
I'm not sure.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.635
        Whoever it is,
        we need to go now.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.137

Where's joe?

34:00.139 --> 34:02.205
        Where do you think?

34:05.643 --> 34:07.544
                So...

34:09.147 --> 34:11.380
            How do you think
            my final act

34:11.382 --> 34:13.516
            Is going so far?

34:13.518 --> 34:16.152
Not bad.

34:16.155 --> 34:19.489
Just got to follow it up
with something big, right?

34:19.491 --> 34:23.493
You going after
tanner now?

What are your
followers up to?

            my old friend.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.735
            I'm slightly
            concerned, though,

34:31.737 --> 34:34.871
        That this may be our
        final moment together

34:34.873 --> 34:37.340
            Because you're right
            about one thing.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.009
            My time is up.

34:39.011 --> 34:41.210
Yeah. It is.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.411
                Hmm.

34:45.216 --> 34:51.054
        Since we're being...
        Intimate, let me ask,

34:51.056 --> 34:54.424
            Do you miss her?

34:54.426 --> 34:59.062
        I mean, how often do you
        think about claire?

34:59.064 --> 35:02.065
            Good, because
            I miss her, ryan.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.401
            I really do.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.203
            She will always be

35:10.409 --> 35:15.512

            I should be off.

            hug or something.

            the spectacle,

            find it worthy.

        write another book.

at the front gate.

                    to go now.

with you?

39:40.145 --> 39:41.978
            He was just with me.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.880
            I think--

39:43.882 --> 39:46.549
            I think he's gone
            to find lily.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.519
Carrie: I'm carrie cooke
with a rather cryptic message

39:49.521 --> 39:51.154
        For joe carroll.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.555
I was told in sincere confidence

39:52.557 --> 39:54.391
    That no one but he
would understand this message.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.692
Emma: You're sure
no one comes here?

39:55.694 --> 39:56.826
        It's my uncle's place.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.828
            He never
            leaves the city.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.832
How can I sleep with the view--
        you asleep,

40:02.834 --> 40:05.735
    Diner lights flashing pink
        on your skin,

40:05.737 --> 40:08.338
        Your breath
        on my shoulder?

40:08.340 --> 40:11.207
    Me, I could die happy.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.343
            No, no, no, no, no.

40:13.345 --> 40:14.844
What's she saying?

40:14.846 --> 40:16.346
Carrie: ...Intended solely
    for joe carroll.

40:16.348 --> 40:17.847
        This had been
an "update america" special...

40:17.849 --> 40:19.349
                Claire.

40:19.351 --> 40:20.750
    Carrie: I'll be back
        this evening

40:20.752 --> 40:22.018
    With all the latest updates
    on the recent murders

40:22.020 --> 40:23.686
    And the ongoing search
        for carroll.

40:23.688 --> 40:26.122
        [footsteps]

40:30.361 --> 40:31.761
                    James?

40:42.239 --> 40:44.174
Hello, lily.

40:48.412 --> 40:50.146
Agent weston.

40:51.215 --> 40:54.584
Get on your knees.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.686
                Do it.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.393
            Where are your sons?

41:03.395 --> 41:05.562
They didn't come.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.064
            I find that
            hard to swallow.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.634
I'm unarmed.
I'll go easily.

41:11.636 --> 41:14.270
Take me into custody.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.806
            Is that
            what you want,

41:16.808 --> 41:18.074
            To go to prison?

41:18.076 --> 41:19.175
            You'd be ok
            with that?

41:23.914 --> 41:26.916
    Mike!
                Ryan, back off.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.786
    Don't.
    Don't do this.

41:29.788 --> 41:33.389
No. Come on.
You're better than this.

41:37.761 --> 41:40.430
        Lily: Mike,
        you're a good man.

41:40.432 --> 41:44.334
        Put the gun down.
        Take me into custody.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.307
            You're wrong, lily.

41:51.309 --> 41:54.277
            I used to be.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.179
            Not anymore.

41:57.781 --> 42:00.049
                Mike--

42:01.785 --> 42:04.854
        Ryan: Mike--
        mike, please.

42:06.824 --> 42:10.560
        This is not you.
        This is me.

42:12.796 --> 42:16.900
    Don't be me, please.

42:38.022 --> 42:41.257
I know this isn't gonna fix
    anything for me...

42:44.228 --> 42:46.729
        But it will fix you.

42:52.202 --> 42:55.271
    [panting]
