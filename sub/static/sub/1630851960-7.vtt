24:48.820 --> 24:49.946
Holy shit!

24:50.197 --> 24:55.118
Wha-- Holy shit! Wait, this is major!
Are you serious?

24:55.202 --> 24:56.453
[Ana] Ah, okay.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.788
Okay, I'll call you back in a bit. Bye.

24:58.872 --> 24:59.706
Ah.

24:59.789 --> 25:00.832
-[laughing Yes, babe!
-What?

25:00.916 --> 25:01.750
[big inhale]

25:01.833 --> 25:05.170
My art is going to be showcased
in a huge gallery show.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.255
-Shut up.
-Like, I'm gonna be the featured artist.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.966
-Me! It's happening!
-Babe, that's fuckin' great! [kisses]

25:10.091 --> 25:12.469
-It's fucking happening!
-[big inhale] I'm so excited for you!

25:12.552 --> 25:14.513
Oh, my God. Tim is so excited.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.641
Wait. Oh, it's his show?

25:17.724 --> 25:20.685
-Yes, whose else would it be? [laughs]
-Right.

25:20.936 --> 25:25.524
[big inhale] Congrats, Banksy, but hello!
You see this little red light blinking?

25:25.607 --> 25:26.816
Okay, sorry.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.737
In five years, oh, God, I see so much.
I see...

25:31.196 --> 25:34.950
I see murals, like, my murals
on the walls of, like, the Bay,

25:35.033 --> 25:38.537
East Harlem, maybe even Tokyo one day.
I see...

25:38.620 --> 25:40.497
Oh, my God, I see stickers of luchadores

25:40.580 --> 25:42.791
making out just plastered
all over the city.

25:42.874 --> 25:48.088
I see... I see my own gallery here,
here in Boyle Heights. Um...

25:48.421 --> 25:52.759
I see commissioned art pieces,
like Becky G and JLo. I see, um,

25:52.842 --> 25:56.555
I see T-shirts and, like, bookbags
and hoodies, I mean...

25:56.638 --> 25:58.515
[inhales] I--

25:58.765 --> 26:00.433
I see so much. [small laugh]

26:10.068 --> 26:12.153
Hey, help me.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.780
[laughs]

26:13.863 --> 26:16.741
-Five more hours and I shed these wheels.
-Are you trying to get rid of me?

26:16.825 --> 26:17.659
[chuckles]

26:20.287 --> 26:21.162
[grunts]

26:21.246 --> 26:24.207
-You all right?
-Wow!

26:27.419 --> 26:28.336
Oh.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.796
There you go.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.174
-You're spoiling me.
-What?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.427
Yeah. What's up?

26:36.219 --> 26:38.263
I just felt like celebrating.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.229
Hey, is this, um-- Is this cilantro?

26:47.981 --> 26:50.108
Watercress. Like it?

26:50.692 --> 26:53.570
-Yeah, it's good.
-Yeah, me too.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.576
So...

27:01.036 --> 27:03.496
last night you talked about staying.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.168
-For family?
-Yeah, you know... um...

27:08.960 --> 27:11.671
my dad, he always wanted
to be a grandpa, and...

27:12.213 --> 27:16.009
Well, my tías are here. My mom's
the only one that's out in the Bay.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.971
Oh, and you're here too. It'd be good
for the baby to see you on the regular.

27:20.055 --> 27:20.889
[small laugh]

27:23.183 --> 27:24.184
You know, when you...

27:24.976 --> 27:27.479
left off to Stanford for undergrad,
that shit was hard.

27:29.356 --> 27:32.067
We broke up so many times, you remember?
[chuckles]

27:34.819 --> 27:36.196
So many times.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.831
Look, Erik...

27:47.207 --> 27:48.041
[small inhale]

27:48.124 --> 27:51.086
I know you don't want me
to take it, okay? But...

27:58.551 --> 28:00.470
It's the best thing for you and the baby.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.889
["Dime Mentiras" plays]

28:06.309 --> 28:08.061
My dream has always been you.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.690
But I'm not trying to hold you back.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.575
You...

28:23.535 --> 28:25.578
You gotta dream big enough
for the both of you.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.082
-Right?
-[sniffs] Mm-hm. [crying]

28:29.457 --> 28:30.458
Hey.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.210
You should go.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.633
[big inhale] You should go.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.884
[crying]

28:41.052 --> 28:41.886
[kisses]

28:42.137 --> 28:43.096
[crying]

29:01.239 --> 29:02.157
Hey, Pop.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.576
[chuckles, in Spanish] How'd it go, son?

29:05.702 --> 29:07.036
When's the wedding?

29:08.037 --> 29:08.872
Uh...

29:23.595 --> 29:24.512
Nah.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.055
[in Spanish] Don't worry.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.727
-Don't worry.
-[in Spanish] I'm okay, Pop.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.353
[in Spanish] Don't worry.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.733
-It's okay.
-[crying]
