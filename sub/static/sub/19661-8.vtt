WEBVTT

00:01.940 --> 00:04.140
- Five weeks on trial.

00:04.250 --> 00:06.689
Now jury deliberations.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.880
I can't do it anymore.

00:08.890 --> 00:13.320
- Is there a problem with
the other jurors, Ms. Spencer?

00:13.320 --> 00:16.690
- No. It's...

00:18.530 --> 00:22.750
It's... A lot of pressure.

00:22.770 --> 00:24.710
I need to go home.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.810
- Your honor, if this juror
wants to be excused,

00:26.810 --> 00:29.110
I won't object.

00:29.110 --> 00:32.880
- Would you step outside
for a moment, Ms. Spencer?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.690
- Please.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.630
- I assume you object, Peter.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.030
- It would be counterproductive

00:51.030 --> 00:53.770
to start deliberations
over again with an alternate.

00:53.770 --> 00:55.600
It's a waste
of everybody's time.

00:55.610 --> 00:56.940
- Forcing her to stay is only
putting more pressure on her

00:56.940 --> 00:58.640
to vote guilty.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.640
- Your client should've
thought of that

00:59.640 --> 01:01.040
before he killed two people.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.010
- What is it with you guys?
There's no jury in earshot.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.750
Send Ms. Spencer back in.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.820
- What are you gonna tell her?

01:16.830 --> 01:21.130
- That we're not
running a club med here.

01:21.130 --> 01:23.000
- Thank you, your honor.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.920
- Publish the verdict, Mr. wick.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.830
- In the case of the people
of the state of Illinois

01:51.830 --> 01:53.630
versus Ricardo mendoza,

01:53.630 --> 01:55.200
on the count of first degree
murder,

01:55.200 --> 02:00.200
the people find the defendant
guilty.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.040
<i>- Escoria racistas!</i>

02:03.640 --> 02:08.840
- The defendant will be remanded
into custody pending sentencing.

02:08.850 --> 02:10.210
<i>- Con cuidado, eh?</i>

02:10.210 --> 02:12.980
- The people thank the jury
for their service.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.720
You are dismissed.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.990
This court stands adjourned.

02:26.130 --> 02:28.200
- Okay, I've been here
long enough.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.000
In the bullpen, there is a board
covered with clothing.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.170
- Yeah. The winners club.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.910
When an Asa wins his or her
first felony trial,

02:37.910 --> 02:40.070
a piece of something they were
wearing when the verdict came in

02:40.080 --> 02:42.440
goes up on the wall.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.750
- There's a piece of a bra
up there.

02:44.750 --> 02:47.180
- What can I say? Second chair
always picks the item.

02:47.180 --> 02:51.820
- You're telling me someone here
actually wore a bowtie?

02:51.820 --> 02:56.190
Yeah, well, I lost a bet.

02:56.190 --> 02:58.230
- Stone.

03:04.030 --> 03:05.830
Yeah.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.940
- Patrol saw her body floating
in the water.

03:16.950 --> 03:19.150
Summons to appear for jury duty
was in her wallet.

03:19.150 --> 03:22.780
Cpd ID'd her.
They called us.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.250
We called you.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.060
- Me says no visible bruising.

03:28.060 --> 03:31.290
The crap up her nose means
she was most likely alive

03:31.290 --> 03:32.990
when they dumped her
in the swim.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.800
- Los hotas?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.970
- She begged to be let
off the case.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.240
Maybe I should've let you go.

04:04.190 --> 04:06.290
- Last week on the kaplan case,

04:06.300 --> 04:07.960
a juror tried to get
out of jury duty

04:07.960 --> 04:10.800
'cause his pet pig was
depressed.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.300
If word gets out that jurors
are being whacked,

04:13.300 --> 04:15.370
we'll never seat another jury.

04:15.370 --> 04:16.899
- I'll have voight
put together...

04:16.910 --> 04:20.040
- no, no, no. I want you
running point on this.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.339
You picked her, right?

04:21.339 --> 04:22.780
- I did, yeah.

04:22.780 --> 04:26.010
- You did right
demanding she stay.

04:26.020 --> 04:29.920
Oh, I want cpd cars, unmarked,
on all the jurors

04:29.920 --> 04:32.050
until we figure this out.

04:32.050 --> 04:33.990
Get the mayor.

04:38.790 --> 04:41.800
- Santiago mendoza.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.400
- This ain't about
parking tickets, is it?

04:43.400 --> 04:44.900
- We're here about Ricardo.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.800
- He okay?
- He's fine.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.000
- For a dude looking
at mandatory life.

04:49.010 --> 04:50.400
- You seemed pretty pissed, too.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.410
Maybe you decided
to do something about that.

04:52.410 --> 04:56.140
- Oh, you caught me.
I'm organizing a prison break.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.420
- Or you killed a juror.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.550
- Whoa, damn. I'm a civilian.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.490
You should be looking
at los hotas, man.

05:06.490 --> 05:09.120
They threatened <i> mi madre</i>
to make sure Ricardo don't rat.

05:09.130 --> 05:11.360
- Where did this happen?

05:11.360 --> 05:12.590
- My mom's house.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.560
Miguel followed her home
first day of trial.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.460
- Miguel Lopez?

05:16.470 --> 05:18.570
- He's a sick bastard.

05:29.010 --> 05:31.110
- Yo, Miguel.

05:32.850 --> 05:34.180
- What...

05:35.480 --> 05:37.050
- hey, what are you doing?

05:43.990 --> 05:45.960
- Where you going, Miguel?
Where you going?

05:54.140 --> 05:55.570
Hands behind your back.

05:55.570 --> 05:57.870
Why'd you make me run, huh?

05:57.870 --> 06:00.140
- You good?
- Yeah.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.480
- What did I do?
- You threatened seÃ±ora mendoza.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.250
That's what.
- I don't even know who that is.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.950
- He really is that stupid.
Ricardo's mother.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.150
- I'm there to support
my homie, bro.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.120
Why would I threaten his mom?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.420
- I don't know... to make sure
your homie doesn't rat you out?

06:12.420 --> 06:14.090
- What about her?
You threaten her, too?

06:14.090 --> 06:16.890
- I don't even... wait.

06:16.890 --> 06:19.260
The bitch from the jury?

06:19.260 --> 06:20.530
- The bitch be dead.

06:20.530 --> 06:21.900
- Are you accusing me?

06:21.900 --> 06:24.030
- She did put your homie away.

06:24.030 --> 06:25.630
- Now first you say
I threatened Ricardo

06:25.640 --> 06:27.230
to keep him from ratting me out,

06:27.240 --> 06:29.500
then I whack a juror
for locking him up?

06:29.510 --> 06:31.940
That don't make sense together.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.540
Who's stupid now?
- Still you.

06:34.540 --> 06:37.040
- Now, maybe instead of crawling
all in my business,

06:37.050 --> 06:39.110
you should talk
to that <i> jurado racista</i>

06:39.120 --> 06:41.080
with the ugly-ass sweaters.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.950
- What are you talking about?
- He was on the jury too.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.250
Bottom row at the end.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.490
I saw him and your dead chick
hashing it out

06:47.490 --> 06:49.120
in the parking lot one night.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.930
- Come on.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.670
Must be hard being stuck
in a room with 11 strangers.

06:57.670 --> 07:00.300
- You mean seven strangers
and four knuckleheads.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.040
We should've been out of there
in two hours.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.640
That kid was guilty as sin.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.640
- Was Lily Spencer
one of the knuckleheads?

07:07.640 --> 07:10.080
- No. She was a "guilty"
after the first ballot.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.080
- Oh, so you didn't have
any trouble with her?

07:12.080 --> 07:14.320
- Why?
She say something?

07:14.320 --> 07:16.650
- You were arguing
in the parking lot.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.690
- That's what she said?

07:18.690 --> 07:21.190
She was crying.
I was consoling her.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.190
- About what?

07:23.190 --> 07:26.090
- She said the trial was ruining
her life. She had to get home.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.200
- Did she mention
anyone from los hotas

07:28.200 --> 07:30.630
giving her a hard time?

07:30.630 --> 07:32.530
- Okay, that's it.

07:32.540 --> 07:35.670
Tell me what's going on,
or get out.

07:35.670 --> 07:38.740
- Lily Spencer is dead,
Mr. Evans.

07:38.740 --> 07:44.110
- Oh, my god.
Such a sweet kid.

07:44.110 --> 07:48.220
Those punks.
They did it, right?

07:48.220 --> 07:50.120
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.590
I was the foreman.

07:51.590 --> 07:53.120
They're gonna come for me now,
right?

07:53.120 --> 07:54.690
I want protection.

07:54.690 --> 07:57.160
- It's already there.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.360
- Did she mention
anything specific?

08:03.370 --> 08:06.070
- Look. All I know is that
someone was driving her nuts

08:06.070 --> 08:08.140
with all those texts.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.640
The judge told us to shut off
our phones.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.140
We did. But Lily said that she
had to keep hers on or...

08:15.140 --> 08:18.650
Or there would be consequences.

08:18.650 --> 08:20.680
- You didn't think
of telling the judge?

08:20.680 --> 08:24.650
- I assumed the texts
were personal business.

08:24.650 --> 08:27.090
I guess I was wrong.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.590
- The phone company
only keeps texts for three days.

08:29.590 --> 08:34.159
Lily received 67 texts,
all from the same guy.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.059
How did los hotas
get her cell number?

08:36.070 --> 08:38.600
- They didn't,
unless one of them was

08:38.600 --> 08:40.230
moonlighting at a tech firm.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.740
Thanks.

08:41.740 --> 08:44.770
The texts are from a phone
owned by jaxco.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.270
- The restaurant app?
- Among others.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.040
We're looking
at a high-tech stalker.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.380
- Here's the last text message:

08:51.380 --> 08:54.650
"It's either the jury
or your kid. Last chance."

09:01.560 --> 09:03.760
- Best day of my life was
when I met Lily.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.060
Worst? Well, when she dumped me.

09:06.060 --> 09:09.300
- We wanted to ask you about
a bunch of texts you sent her.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.700
- Lily and I broke up.
We didn't declare war.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.270
We communicated daily
because of Sam, our son.

09:16.270 --> 09:18.810
Hey, buddy. Say hey.
- Hi.

09:18.810 --> 09:20.810
- We're gonna be right in here,
okay?

09:22.410 --> 09:24.650
Please.

09:24.650 --> 09:27.380
- You share custody?
- 50/50.

09:27.380 --> 09:31.450
That's why you're here, right?
- Not exactly.

09:31.450 --> 09:34.460
- Did something happen to Lily?

09:34.460 --> 09:36.860
I'm sorry.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.800
When?

09:41.800 --> 09:46.800
- We found her two nights ago.
- Her body was in the river.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.370
- You people... you forced her
onto that damn case.

09:50.370 --> 09:51.870
You should've protected her!

09:54.810 --> 09:58.480
Thank god it was my day.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.750
Just tell me you have
the bastard in custody.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.820
What? What is it?

10:06.820 --> 10:10.790
- You sent her 67 texts
in 3 days, Mr. Clark.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.560
You didn't get a response
for two days.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.690
You didn't find that odd?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.600
- Hold on.
If you're suggesting

10:15.600 --> 10:17.330
that I had something
to do with this...

10:17.330 --> 10:19.600
- well, you sent her a text,
and I quote,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.770
"it's either the jury
or your kid."

10:21.770 --> 10:24.510
Kind of sounds like a threat.

10:24.510 --> 10:26.740
- All right.
Out of context,

10:26.740 --> 10:29.380
okay, yeah,
maybe that sounds bad,

10:29.380 --> 10:34.620
but the thing is, people think
you invent a couple apps,

10:34.620 --> 10:36.520
you just sit on your butt
and cash checks.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.850
I'm busy, okay?
Sam was hounding me.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.720
Kids don't understand jury duty.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.760
All he knows is that his mother
missed another soccer game.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.860
- Nice boat.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.900
- Yeah,
it's a 1936 grebe cruiser.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.630
- Huh. You ever take Lily out
on it?

10:54.740 --> 10:57.370
- There wasn't enough dramamine
in the city.

10:57.370 --> 10:58.740
- When was the last time
you took it out?

10:58.740 --> 11:01.640
- About a week ago.

11:01.640 --> 11:02.810
- Dad?

11:02.810 --> 11:05.750
- One second, Sam.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.620
Are we good?

11:08.620 --> 11:11.890
- Two nights ago...
- I was home with Sam.

11:11.890 --> 11:15.360
All night.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.460
- Good.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.530
- There she is, the beauty.

11:21.530 --> 11:23.530
- Mr. Clark take her out
recently?

11:23.530 --> 11:25.400
- Sure. Two days ago.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.470
Scratched her up real bad.
I buffed and waxed. Good as new.

11:29.470 --> 11:32.510
- Was she with him?

11:32.510 --> 11:36.880
- Yeah, honestly, i...
I can't keep them straight.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.880
- Eddie, would you mind
handing me that hoodie?

11:46.220 --> 11:47.420
Thank you.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.760
- Is there anything else?

11:48.760 --> 11:52.530
- No, we're good.
Thanks for your help.

11:52.530 --> 11:57.460
Huh. "How to avoid getting
a warrant" by Laura nagel.

11:57.470 --> 11:58.730
- Wonder if these are Lily's.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.470
- Oh, there you go.
Looks like Clark fibbed

12:02.470 --> 12:03.900
about bringing Lily aboard, too.

12:03.910 --> 12:05.940
- Clark's a little bit
of a prick, right?

12:05.940 --> 12:07.640
- Lie to me once...

12:07.640 --> 12:10.840
- So, tell me,
how does he get joint custody?

12:10.850 --> 12:12.610
- Judges are like that now.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.250
Even if they think the dad
may be questionable,

12:14.250 --> 12:15.580
judge says it's a good idea

12:15.580 --> 12:18.490
for the kid
to have both parents.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.020
It's only temporary.
You'll get Jen back soon.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.530
- Yeah.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.830
- He owns a hot tech company,

12:27.830 --> 12:30.630
and the mother of his kid
works at Walmart.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.730
- A perk of not being married.

12:32.740 --> 12:35.900
Hoodie was Sam's.

12:37.570 --> 12:40.710
- Maybe Clark only told us
one fib.

12:40.710 --> 12:42.040
- Mm.

12:46.810 --> 12:48.280
- Lily was being evicted.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.620
This notice is dated
the day she died.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.990
- Hey! What's going on?

12:52.990 --> 12:55.460
- It's okay.
State's attorneys.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.820
- Is Lily okay?

12:56.830 --> 12:58.630
- Are you a friend of hers?

12:58.630 --> 13:00.590
- I guess.
I'm the live-in manager.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.500
- She was murdered.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.070
- Wh...
What about Sam?

13:05.070 --> 13:07.300
- He's fine.
He's with his father.

13:10.310 --> 13:13.310
She was my favorite tenant.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.980
- Why were you booting her?

13:14.980 --> 13:17.880
- I just manage the building.
I don't own it.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.910
She was three months behind.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.480
- She talk about Sam's dad much?

13:22.480 --> 13:25.690
- I asked. She didn't want
to talk about him.

13:25.690 --> 13:27.720
Now Grayson's gonna
let me have it.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.560
- Grayson?
- The owner.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.790
He gave me a lot of flac
for renting to her.

13:31.790 --> 13:33.790
She'd been evicted
from two other places.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.030
- Well, why did you, then?

13:35.030 --> 13:38.630
- Her sister, Sarah,
cosigned the lease.

13:38.630 --> 13:41.700
- You know
where we can find Sarah?

13:42.970 --> 13:46.910
- Sarah's my wife...
Was my wife.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.710
She passed away
three months ago.

13:48.710 --> 13:51.880
Ovarian cancer.

13:51.880 --> 13:55.080
I promised Sarah
I'd take care of Lily.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.880
- You mean financially?

13:56.890 --> 14:00.550
- That, too.
This is so sad.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.360
Lily used to be an assistant
professor of English

14:03.360 --> 14:06.760
at ccu, you know?
- What happened?

14:06.760 --> 14:08.760
- Jaxson Clark happened.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.930
We told her to back off,
but she wouldn't listen.

14:10.930 --> 14:14.670
- Did he hit her?
- Bruises fade.

14:14.670 --> 14:19.010
Bones heal.
Humiliation is forever.

14:19.010 --> 14:22.540
You want to know how?

14:22.540 --> 14:25.580
Okay. We went over there
for dinner.

14:25.580 --> 14:27.810
Chicken Kiev, Jaxson's favorite.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.780
It was obvious that Lily
had worked her butt off

14:30.790 --> 14:33.650
to make sure
that everything was perfect.

14:33.660 --> 14:36.160
Jaxson takes one bite,

14:36.160 --> 14:38.930
says it's dry,
and orders a pizza.

14:38.930 --> 14:40.960
Real empathy, huh?

14:40.960 --> 14:43.700
- Why did she stop teaching?

14:43.700 --> 14:46.970
- "The mother of my son
will not work."

14:46.970 --> 14:50.000
After they split up,
it got worse.

14:50.010 --> 14:54.040
He started calling her,
texting her nonstop.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.980
Sarah and I went to the cops
with her

14:55.980 --> 14:57.880
to get a restraining order.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.010
They told her to stop
checking her messages,

15:00.020 --> 15:01.720
answering his calls.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.850
- It's not a bad idea.

15:03.850 --> 15:07.120
- Jaxson labeled every text,
"about Sam."

15:07.120 --> 15:08.890
How could she not look?

15:08.890 --> 15:11.430
The last time we spoke,

15:11.430 --> 15:16.000
she said she actually
spotted him watching her.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.430
- When was that?
- Before that stupid trial.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.800
She was over by the river.
- The river?

15:22.810 --> 15:24.810
- Under the
lasalle street bridge.

15:24.810 --> 15:27.140
It's where we sprinkled
Sarah's ashes.

15:27.140 --> 15:30.740
Lily would go down there
to feel close to Sarah.

15:30.750 --> 15:36.720
She saw Jaxson on the bridge
staring down at her.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.190
- Thank you.

15:40.460 --> 15:42.160
That's not far
from where we found Lily.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.020
- Mm-hmm.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.460
- No, sorry.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.830
- You sure? No?

15:49.830 --> 15:52.030
Have you seen this girl?
You sure?

15:56.100 --> 15:57.770
- Nothing.

15:57.770 --> 16:00.210
- How is it possible
that nobody saw anything?

16:00.210 --> 16:02.180
A fight, a... an argument.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.910
- Maybe they did,
but they didn't care.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.150
- What the hell is that?

16:12.150 --> 16:14.990
For sure!

16:14.990 --> 16:17.090
- Hashers?
- That's what we call ourselves.

16:17.090 --> 16:19.060
We're a drinking club
with a running problem.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.860
You know what I mean?

16:20.860 --> 16:22.200
- How often do you run?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.200
- Mondays, wednesdays,
and Fridays.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.070
Depends on if we got after it
Thursday night, you know?

16:27.070 --> 16:30.040
- You always wear cameras?
- Oh, yeah. These guys?

16:30.040 --> 16:31.940
How else would we remember it
the next day?

16:31.940 --> 16:34.170
- You happen to record
Wednesday's run?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.980
What happened to good
old-fashioned drinking?

16:37.980 --> 16:39.250
- Ugh.

16:39.250 --> 16:42.080
Oh, man. Just watching them,
I want to puke.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.120
- Apparently you're not alone.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.960
- Ugh.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.700
- Hold on.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.100
Back up.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.100
Stop.

17:03.110 --> 17:05.569
Right there. Zoom in.

17:06.910 --> 17:08.710
Pink coat.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.740
- That's Lily.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.150
- Okay, play it from here.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.119
- That water's freezing.
What is she doing?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.819
- Killing herself.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.230
- Oh, man.

17:36.770 --> 17:39.310
- Ooh. Oh, we're good.
Thank you.

17:39.310 --> 17:43.840
- Close to 30 million cows
were slaughtered in 2016 alone.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.110
- This is pork.

17:46.110 --> 17:48.680
- Anyway, the me's report says
Lily's lungs were filled

17:48.680 --> 17:51.280
with river water,
making the COD drowning.

17:51.290 --> 17:54.090
- Ah. External bruising?
- Mm-mm.

17:54.090 --> 17:56.720
She had klonopin in her blood.
- How much?

17:56.730 --> 17:59.330
- Enough to stop her
from changing her mind.

17:59.330 --> 18:01.290
It was a suicide, Peter.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.160
- The duct tape didn't
look suspicious to you?

18:03.170 --> 18:07.230
- Walking into a freezing river
is suspicious.

18:07.240 --> 18:11.140
The best way to make sure you'll
drown is to not be able to swim.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.670
- How in the world
did she tape herself?

18:13.680 --> 18:15.810
- You'd be amazed
by what you can find on YouTube.

18:15.810 --> 18:17.710
I'm happy to pursue this,

18:17.710 --> 18:19.210
but what exactly
am I looking for?

18:19.210 --> 18:21.310
- Something that will allow me
to charge Jaxson Clark

18:21.320 --> 18:23.820
with the stalking
and harassment of Lily Spencer.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.220
- Without a victim?

18:26.220 --> 18:28.120
This isn't on you.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.620
- She came to me. She said
she was under a lot of pressure.

18:30.630 --> 18:33.190
I didn't... Listen.

18:36.830 --> 18:39.830
- Her sister's wife said Lily
and her ex spent time in court.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.300
I'll look into their
domestic relations court files.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.640
- There you go.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.110
- If someone took me to court
as much as Jaxson took Lily,

18:50.110 --> 18:52.650
I might consider
a few drastic measures myself.

18:52.650 --> 18:55.280
Twice a month since they split.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.220
Motion for financial disclosure.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.890
- She worked at Walmart.

18:58.890 --> 19:01.420
- Motion to update
financial disclosure.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.160
Motion to preclude visitation.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.860
- Let me guess:
Motion for monitored visitation.

19:06.860 --> 19:08.660
- Right.

19:08.660 --> 19:12.730
- Over and over until she
just couldn't fight anymore.

19:12.730 --> 19:15.340
I bet Clark didn't
even want the kid.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.370
He just didn't want Lily
to have him.

19:17.370 --> 19:20.770
- There are two sides
to every story.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.440
Family services investigated
five cases of abuse

19:23.450 --> 19:26.880
in regards to Sam,
all against Lily.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.250
- Might explain
why Jaxson wanted full custody.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.980
- Hm.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.290
- I'll talk to the kid.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.820
It's better if I go alone.

19:35.820 --> 19:37.360
I mean,
if his mom did abuse him,

19:37.360 --> 19:39.460
he might be more comfortable
talking to a guy.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.430
- I'll hit dcfs.
- You want company?

19:44.430 --> 19:46.900
- I'm driving.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.400
- Jaxson called our hotline
about Lily for everything.

19:50.410 --> 19:53.270
Lily left Sam alone to borrow
an egg from a neighbor?

19:53.280 --> 19:55.210
Inadequate supervision.

19:55.210 --> 19:57.010
Sam saw a roach?

19:57.010 --> 19:59.750
Claimed unsafe
living conditions.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.720
- What about the abuse claims?

20:01.720 --> 20:04.480
- Sam had a nasty bruise
on his upper arm.

20:04.490 --> 20:06.790
Kid stepped
into oncoming traffic.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.460
Lily grabbed him, left a mark.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.930
- Every nine-year-old in the
city probably has the same one.

20:11.930 --> 20:15.260
- Only one of their parents
didn't file a claim with us.

20:15.260 --> 20:18.500
- Hold on. You took Sam away
from Lily for three months

20:18.500 --> 20:20.930
because of a black and blue
mark?

20:20.940 --> 20:24.340
- Look, from what I can tell,
Lily is a good mom.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.470
But it is my job
to protect the child.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.240
I can't ignore complaints.

20:28.240 --> 20:32.350
- Was there any real abuse?

20:32.350 --> 20:34.350
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

20:34.350 --> 20:37.020
- Chad, Lily's dead.

20:37.020 --> 20:38.990
That means she's lost custody
permanently,

20:38.990 --> 20:40.750
so if you're
holding anything back...

20:40.760 --> 20:44.860
- one time when I stopped by
to do a safety visit,

20:44.860 --> 20:46.460
Lily had a cast on her arm.

20:46.460 --> 20:50.760
She claimed she fell
down the stairs.

20:50.770 --> 20:53.430
- Jaxson?
- I didn't say that.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.340
I have no evidence
that he ever touched her.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.370
I do know that he wanted
full custody of Sam.

20:59.370 --> 21:02.510
I also know that Lily was
not about to give him up.

21:02.510 --> 21:04.380
And she did say
it was an accident,

21:04.380 --> 21:05.810
so what was I gonna do?

21:05.810 --> 21:09.080
- Oh, I don't know. Something?

21:16.790 --> 21:18.890
- It's supposed to be
best interest of the child.

21:18.890 --> 21:21.260
The only interest these people
look out for is their own.

21:21.260 --> 21:24.000
- I assume you're speaking
from personal experience?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.400
- Oh, great. Did you read that
on a bathroom wall?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.870
- You did kind of overreact
in there.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.900
- You want to hear
about overreaction?

21:30.910 --> 21:34.810
My ex tells the courts that my
irrational behavior worries him,

21:34.810 --> 21:38.040
so for the next six months, the
only way that I could see Jen

21:38.050 --> 21:41.350
was through the supervision
of a state-approved monitor.

21:50.290 --> 21:52.460
My advice: Don't get married.

21:52.460 --> 21:55.300
- Oh, I don't plan to.

21:55.300 --> 21:59.000
- Here I had you pegged
as a hubby, five kids,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.070
living in a brownstone
in Lincoln park kind of gal.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.570
- I want kids even less
than I want a husband.

22:04.570 --> 22:06.310
- You tell your boyfriend that?

22:06.310 --> 22:07.910
- I don't have a boyfriend.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.440
- You don't get lonely?

22:09.440 --> 22:11.440
- Didn't say I was celibate.

22:11.450 --> 22:13.080
Just no one regular.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.590
Chicago med?

22:18.590 --> 22:22.520
- Yep. Lily's case worker said
she had a broken arm.

22:30.060 --> 22:33.930
- Hey, Sam, remember me?
Detective Dawson?

22:33.940 --> 22:35.970
- Yeah. Hi.

22:35.970 --> 22:37.000
- Mind if I talk to you
a minute?

22:37.010 --> 22:38.570
- No.

22:40.470 --> 22:42.540
- Where's your dad?

22:42.540 --> 22:46.880
- He's late.
He always is.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.480
- Sorry about your mom.

22:50.490 --> 22:53.450
I lost someone close to me
when I was young, too.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.420
I know you won't buy this now,
but it gets better.

23:00.090 --> 23:03.000
Let me ask you something, Sam.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.070
Did your mom ever hit you?

23:06.070 --> 23:08.100
- No.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.040
- It doesn't mean she didn't
love you if she did.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.970
Sometimes things get
too tough for moms,

23:13.980 --> 23:15.610
they take it out on their kids.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.110
I know about this because...

23:17.110 --> 23:20.010
- Sam!

23:20.020 --> 23:22.520
Let's go.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.150
Now. Come on.

23:24.150 --> 23:25.590
- Hey, take it easy.
- Don't touch me.

23:25.590 --> 23:26.990
Ow! Aah!

23:26.990 --> 23:29.660
- Stop! Stop!
- Let go of my arm!

23:29.660 --> 23:32.530
Stop! Stop!

23:32.530 --> 23:34.490
- Let go of my arm!

23:42.000 --> 23:43.600
Come on. Let's go.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.070
- Put the phones away.

23:50.680 --> 23:55.010
- Lily Jane Spencer was
brought in for an od.

23:55.020 --> 23:56.650
- Klonopin?

23:56.650 --> 24:00.050
- She washed a handful down
with a bottle of wine.

24:00.060 --> 24:02.020
- Do you think she was trying
to kill herself?

24:02.020 --> 24:04.720
- It says here she spoke
to one of our psychiatrists...

24:04.730 --> 24:07.530
Or, rather,
he tried to speak to her.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.560
She wasn't too talkative.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.560
I'll tell you what:
This lady was lucky

24:11.570 --> 24:13.970
someone found her in time
and called 911.

24:13.970 --> 24:15.570
- And her broken arm?

24:15.570 --> 24:18.170
- Um, her hair was wet
when she came in.

24:18.170 --> 24:19.610
She was pretty doped up.

24:19.610 --> 24:21.670
She probably slipped
getting out of the bath.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.480
It's amazing
that's all she broke.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.210
Excuse me.

24:28.580 --> 24:31.750
- He sent her more than 60 texts
in two days,

24:31.750 --> 24:34.190
after which she pops
a bunch of pills,

24:34.190 --> 24:36.220
passes out, falls,
and breaks her arm.

24:36.220 --> 24:40.290
To wit: "Sammy's eye is black.
His knee is scraped."

24:40.300 --> 24:42.030
She replies back,
"he had a snowball fight

24:42.030 --> 24:43.460
with his friends."

24:43.470 --> 24:45.530
He texts back,
"don't lie to me, Lily.

24:45.530 --> 24:49.100
"I'm filing a discontinuation
of shared custody motion

24:49.100 --> 24:50.470
"in the morning.

24:50.470 --> 24:53.110
Once again, you're a loser."

24:53.110 --> 24:55.610
- I'm surprised he didn't add,
"lol."

24:55.610 --> 24:58.750
- He did. And the next morning,
he filed the motion.

24:58.750 --> 25:04.080
This is harassment.
Maybe stalking.

25:04.090 --> 25:07.090
- Do you think Clark knew
about her first suicide attempt?

25:07.090 --> 25:09.590
- Dawson and nagel said he
wasn't what you'd call helpful.

25:14.230 --> 25:17.560
What do you think we should do?

25:17.570 --> 25:19.770
- I think the guy's an ass.

25:19.770 --> 25:23.140
I also think there are stalking
and harassment laws

25:23.140 --> 25:25.240
on the books for a reason.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.050
- Rob, this is...
This is the strategy?

25:40.060 --> 25:42.520
Kristy, this is what we call
marketing, huh?

25:42.520 --> 25:45.160
'Cause I could grab some
prepubescent kids...

25:46.590 --> 25:48.330
Did you come back
to knock me around some more?

25:48.330 --> 25:49.630
- We have other business
right now.

25:49.630 --> 25:51.130
- Yeah?

25:51.130 --> 25:53.670
- Jaxson Clark,
I'm placing you under arrest

25:53.670 --> 25:56.140
for the stalking and harassment
of Lily Spencer.

25:56.140 --> 25:57.140
You have the right
to remain silent.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.770
- Penny, call Miranda sharp.

25:58.770 --> 26:00.540
Pick up Sam from school,

26:00.540 --> 26:03.080
take him to my house,
and wait there with him.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.780
Should be back in an hour.

26:09.180 --> 26:12.090
- Stalking, harassment,
inducement.

26:12.090 --> 26:13.820
I mean, while we're going
with bogus counts,

26:13.820 --> 26:17.390
I've always wanted to defend
someone charged with mayhem.

26:17.390 --> 26:21.160
I just like saying it.
Mayhem.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.160
- I forgot how much
you enjoy this, Miranda.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.260
- Well, if we don't have fun,
what have we got?

26:25.270 --> 26:28.330
- We've got stalking,
harassment, and inducement.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.440
- Ooh, feisty.

26:32.570 --> 26:33.770
Do you know how many great
restaurants I found

26:33.780 --> 26:35.170
because of this guy?

26:35.180 --> 26:37.780
I can't have him going
to prison.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.310
He has a kid, stone.

26:39.310 --> 26:41.610
- You want me to pay a fine?
I'll pay a fine.

26:41.620 --> 26:42.680
- If that's why you called
this meeting...

26:42.680 --> 26:44.250
- no.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.850
This is.

26:46.860 --> 26:48.650
<i>- Hey, take it easy.
- Don't touch me.</i>

26:48.660 --> 26:51.160
<i>Ow! Aah!
- Stop! Stop!</i>

26:51.160 --> 26:53.360
<i>- Let go of my arm!</i>

26:53.360 --> 26:55.330
- That looks like brutality
to me.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.770
- You know what's more fun
than mayhem, Miranda?

27:02.440 --> 27:03.900
Extortion.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.670
- What happened
to your sense of humor?

27:05.670 --> 27:07.210
Put that away.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.770
I'm sure we can work this out.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.910
- Mr. Clark pleads guilty
to a class four felony

27:10.910 --> 27:12.910
stalking charge,
he serves two years.

27:12.910 --> 27:15.350
When he's out, he enrolls
in anger management classes.

27:15.350 --> 27:17.720
- Two years?
- I think you meant to say

27:17.720 --> 27:19.350
six months, out in three
with good behavior.

27:19.350 --> 27:20.790
- I'm sure you told your client

27:20.790 --> 27:22.620
if we go to trial
he's looking at four years.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.360
- For what?

27:24.360 --> 27:27.360
- We can start with over 1,500
harassing and threatening texts

27:27.360 --> 27:28.860
in three months.

27:28.860 --> 27:30.730
- Two years.
Take it or leave it.

27:30.730 --> 27:32.830
- It's not my fault
Lily finally got it right.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.270
- You knew about Lily's
first suicide attempt?

27:39.270 --> 27:41.370
- Jaxson.
- Yeah.

27:41.380 --> 27:43.480
Yeah, she called me, crying.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.350
Waah, waah, like a...
Like a pathetic goat.

27:47.350 --> 27:49.380
Next thing I know,
her lesbo sister's blaming me

27:49.380 --> 27:52.950
because Lily went full
Whitney Houston in the bathtub.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.760
- You should've taken
the two years, Mr. Clark.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.860
Now I'm charging you
with Lily's murder.

28:10.770 --> 28:11.970
- Are you out of your mind?

28:11.970 --> 28:14.870
<i>"Sui,"</i> from the Latin,

28:14.880 --> 28:16.510
meaning "of self."

28:16.510 --> 28:18.510
<i>"Cidium,"</i>
Latin for "a killing."

28:18.510 --> 28:20.380
Put them together,
and what do you get?

28:20.380 --> 28:21.980
You don't get murder...
That's what.

28:21.980 --> 28:23.820
- I know I'm pushing it, mark.

28:23.820 --> 28:27.420
- The man was across town when
his ex walked into the lake,

28:27.420 --> 28:28.750
for god's sake.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.990
- It's like he sent her
a letter bomb.

28:29.990 --> 28:31.960
- No, it's not.
No, it's not.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.960
With a letter bomb, there's no
intervening, independent cause.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.530
Namely, her own death wish.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.700
- He was the direct cause
of her death.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.240
I'm gonna argue
if he knew she was suicidal,

28:43.240 --> 28:45.000
it's like knowing she'd open
the exploding letter.

28:45.010 --> 28:48.740
- How cute. But it's
the legislature's job

28:48.740 --> 28:50.840
to write new law, not ours.

28:50.850 --> 28:53.950
- I'm not writing new law.
I'm just stretching the old.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.550
- Emotional abuse of women
is typically viewed

29:00.560 --> 29:02.860
as less harmful
than physical abuse.

29:02.860 --> 29:06.790
If you can't see the injury,
how bad can it really be?

29:06.790 --> 29:10.730
- So, a husband loses his temper
and screams at his wife

29:10.730 --> 29:12.330
when she erases
the football game

29:12.330 --> 29:15.270
that he was looking forward
to watching all week.

29:15.270 --> 29:16.440
Is that emotional abuse?

29:16.440 --> 29:18.340
- No.
If he does it once,

29:18.340 --> 29:20.470
in isolation, of course not.

29:20.480 --> 29:24.340
- Could it be written?
Like in an email or a text?

29:24.350 --> 29:27.380
- Yes. What's critical
in these cases is

29:27.380 --> 29:31.050
the repetition of the
criticism... the insult or blame.

29:31.050 --> 29:33.350
At a certain point,
the victim goes from being

29:33.350 --> 29:36.960
simply humiliated to
suffering diminished dignity.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.890
Her self-worth
and her self-confidence

29:38.890 --> 29:41.060
are utterly destroyed.

29:41.060 --> 29:45.360
- Is it possible that
such a victim becomes suicidal?

29:45.370 --> 29:47.930
- Without self-worth, why go on?

29:51.970 --> 29:54.470
- You're doing important work,
Dr. Cole.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.040
I applaud you for it.

29:57.050 --> 29:59.080
I wonder, can you tell me,

29:59.080 --> 30:02.380
is suicide always caused
by one specific thing?

30:02.380 --> 30:04.620
- Sometimes there are
several causes.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.350
- Lily Spencer had lost job
after job.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.990
She was facing eviction again.

30:08.990 --> 30:11.920
Her sister had just passed away
from ovarian cancer.

30:11.930 --> 30:14.960
- Her ex was
emotionally abusive.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.560
- That too, perhaps.
Not to mention

30:17.570 --> 30:20.800
she was facing five weeks
of jury duty.

30:20.800 --> 30:24.470
I mean, this was a woman riddled
with anxiety.

30:24.470 --> 30:26.570
Lily begged to be let go.

30:29.010 --> 30:32.550
So, isn't it possible
that all of those things

30:32.550 --> 30:36.120
caused Lily Spencer
to take her own life?

30:36.120 --> 30:38.850
- It's possible.

30:38.850 --> 30:41.620
- Dr. Cole,
how long have you been studying

30:41.620 --> 30:43.660
the psychology of abuse?

30:43.660 --> 30:45.060
- 18 years.

30:45.060 --> 30:48.430
- And yet,
in your expert medical opinion,

30:48.430 --> 30:52.100
you cannot say for sure that
Jaxson's behavior was

30:52.100 --> 30:54.670
the sole cause
of Lily's suicide,

30:54.670 --> 30:57.070
isn't that right?

30:57.070 --> 30:59.040
- Yes.

30:59.040 --> 31:03.040
- Then how in the world could
a layman like Jaxson Phelps

31:03.040 --> 31:05.580
possibly know that his actions
would result

31:05.580 --> 31:07.650
in the death of Lily Spencer?

31:16.590 --> 31:19.930
- It started with small things
at first.

31:19.930 --> 31:23.660
He criticized the way
Lily loaded the dishwasher,

31:23.660 --> 31:27.470
what books she read,
how she dressed.

31:27.470 --> 31:33.010
He started to isolate her
from her friends, family.

31:33.010 --> 31:38.040
He said that Sarah and
I were a bad influence on Sam.

31:38.050 --> 31:41.480
- Why would he say that?
- We're gay.

31:43.580 --> 31:47.650
- Did things get easier for Lily
once she split from Jaxson?

31:47.660 --> 31:50.720
- In some ways they got worse.

31:50.730 --> 31:53.660
All those horrible texts
he sent her.

31:53.660 --> 31:57.660
I swear that's what made her try
to kill herself the first time.

31:57.670 --> 32:01.200
When Jaxson found out, he said
to her, right to her face,

32:01.200 --> 32:04.670
"what kind of loser
can't even kill herself?"

32:10.710 --> 32:14.010
- Ms. kelman,

32:14.020 --> 32:16.120
do you recognize this?

32:19.190 --> 32:20.650
- Yes.

32:20.660 --> 32:23.060
- Could you please tell us
what it is?

32:23.060 --> 32:27.130
- It's a text that Lily sent me
shortly before Sarah died.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.230
- Could you please read it
to the court?

32:36.670 --> 32:39.210
- "I can't live without Sarah.

32:39.210 --> 32:42.240
If Sarah dies,
my life's not worth living."

32:42.240 --> 32:44.780
- Objection. Hearsay.

32:44.780 --> 32:46.650
- Offered to show
the declarant's frame of mind

32:46.650 --> 32:48.250
and emotional state
at the time this statement

32:48.250 --> 32:50.150
was made, your honor.

32:50.150 --> 32:52.250
- Overruled.

32:55.790 --> 32:58.160
- Nothing further, Ms. kelman.

33:05.930 --> 33:08.170
- Just so you know,
Gloria says you're becoming

33:08.170 --> 33:10.870
some kind of feminist hero.

33:10.870 --> 33:12.970
But she married me.
What does she know?

33:12.970 --> 33:14.910
- I may not have the law
fully at my back,

33:14.910 --> 33:16.180
but I think the jury's with me.

33:16.180 --> 33:18.210
- Hm.
- Truth be told,

33:18.210 --> 33:20.550
I'm a little worried
about tomorrow.

33:20.550 --> 33:21.980
- Yeah, who isn't?

33:21.980 --> 33:25.220
- Sharp's calling Sam Clark
to the stand.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.820
- To rave about
what a great daddy he is.

33:27.820 --> 33:29.990
- How do you cross-examine
a nine-year-old

33:29.990 --> 33:33.290
whose father's on trial
for killing his mother?

33:33.290 --> 33:35.190
- Gently.

33:42.200 --> 33:46.310
- Hey, Sam. You mind
if I ask you a few questions?

33:48.310 --> 33:50.110
It'll be easy. I promise.

33:52.850 --> 33:54.850
That is quite the scar you got
there.

33:54.850 --> 33:57.550
Did you get that playing soccer?

33:57.550 --> 33:59.920
- I burned myself at the stove
at my dad's house.

33:59.920 --> 34:04.220
But dad took me to the hospital.

34:04.230 --> 34:07.030
- Did you call your mom
and tell her what happened?

34:07.030 --> 34:11.199
- I'm not allowed to
call my mom by myself.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.330
- Why not?

34:13.330 --> 34:16.070
- Dad said that
'cause she didn't pay the bill

34:16.070 --> 34:18.670
she wasn't allowed to use up
my minutes.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.270
- What if you wanted to call her
and tell her

34:22.280 --> 34:24.679
about something that happened
at school?

34:31.320 --> 34:34.090
It's okay, Sam.

34:34.090 --> 34:37.190
In a courtroom, you're supposed
to answer all the questions.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.630
- It doesn't cost anything.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.070
- What doesn't?
- Snapchat.

34:48.070 --> 34:50.600
- Your honor,
there doesn't seem to be a point

34:50.610 --> 34:52.639
to this questioning.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.010
- Good job, Sam.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.380
- I happen to agree
with the defense, Mr. stone.

35:03.380 --> 35:06.990
- Refusing to allow the child
to communicate with his mother

35:06.990 --> 35:10.090
was part of the defendant's
pattern of abusive behavior.

35:10.090 --> 35:11.960
- He just testified
that he spoke to his mother

35:11.960 --> 35:13.130
through snapchat.

35:13.130 --> 35:16.630
- Fine. Then I move
to examine the phone.

35:16.630 --> 35:19.060
- It's irrelevant.

35:19.070 --> 35:21.170
- You opened the door,
Ms. sharp.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.200
Do you have your phone
with you, son?

35:32.380 --> 35:34.250
<i>- You're the worst mother ever!</i>

35:34.250 --> 35:36.650
<i>I hate you!
I want to live with my dad,</i>

35:36.650 --> 35:39.750
<i>and I'm gonna tell the judge
that!</i>

35:41.660 --> 35:45.720
- Who was home the night you
shot this snapchat for your mom?

35:45.730 --> 35:48.190
- Me and my dad.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.760
- Did your dad know that you
made this snapchat for her?

35:54.030 --> 35:55.900
- No.

35:55.900 --> 35:58.440
- Were you mad at her?

35:58.440 --> 36:00.740
- I don't know.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.340
- You told her you hated her,
Sam.

36:10.450 --> 36:12.380
You said that you wanted
to go live with your dad.

36:12.390 --> 36:15.090
Did you mean that?

36:15.090 --> 36:17.720
- Not really.

36:17.730 --> 36:19.760
- Then why'd you say it?

36:26.400 --> 36:29.700
Did your dad tell you
to say that?

36:33.210 --> 36:35.310
Sam, would you watch the screen,
please?

36:41.180 --> 36:43.380
There.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.450
You see that?

36:45.450 --> 36:47.750
You see your arms?

36:55.400 --> 36:59.030
Who's holding the phone, Sam?

36:59.030 --> 37:02.400
Hey, look at me.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.170
You know what?
You're not in trouble.

37:06.170 --> 37:08.270
But I need you to
answer my question.

37:12.180 --> 37:16.750
My dad. He made me send it.

37:16.750 --> 37:21.220
I didn't want to,
but he made me.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.820
Is it my fault?

37:24.830 --> 37:27.430
Did I kill my mom?

37:27.430 --> 37:31.330
- No, Sam. No.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.530
It's not your fault.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.790
- On the sole count
of first degree murder,

37:52.790 --> 37:56.520
the jury finds the defendant,
Jaxson Clark, guilty.

38:10.870 --> 38:14.040
- Before you people started
to deliberate,

38:14.040 --> 38:18.140
I instructed you on how to apply
the law regarding murder.

38:18.150 --> 38:22.450
Yes, I detest this defendant.

38:22.450 --> 38:26.450
He did what he did, and a woman
may have died because of it.

38:26.450 --> 38:31.060
But "may have"
is not good enough.

38:31.060 --> 38:34.390
You rendered a decision based
purely on emotion.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.500
Sit down, Mr. stone.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.540
You ignored my instructions
completely,

38:43.540 --> 38:46.410
and now you force me
to ignore your decision.

38:46.410 --> 38:50.510
- Your honor, i...
- I said sit, Mr. stone.

38:54.110 --> 38:58.420
Unlike you, I actually listened
to the testimony.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.220
The prosecution
clearly did not establish

39:01.220 --> 39:04.220
that the defendant knew
his actions would result

39:04.230 --> 39:05.520
in Ms. Spencer's death.

39:05.530 --> 39:09.130
Therefore, I am setting aside
your verdict.

39:09.130 --> 39:12.460
You are free to go, Mr. Clark.

39:12.470 --> 39:14.970
And you are dismissed.

39:31.380 --> 39:34.250
- I thought judges only
overruled the jury verdict

39:34.260 --> 39:36.220
in textbooks.

39:37.890 --> 39:39.560
- I know.

39:39.560 --> 39:43.430
I should never have
dropped the lesser charges.

39:43.430 --> 39:45.460
- You got your head out
in front of your skis.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.570
We all do it.
Once.

39:48.570 --> 39:53.410
- Clark is getting a total pass.

39:53.410 --> 39:55.510
- You know what I think?

39:55.510 --> 39:58.480
I think you should go home,
go to sleep.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.380
I guarantee you, you wake up
in the morning,

40:00.380 --> 40:03.180
there will be a brand new
bad guy waiting for you.

40:03.180 --> 40:06.690
- I just hope
I can recognize him.

40:06.690 --> 40:09.690
I saw the same thing happen
to a friend of mine.

40:09.690 --> 40:12.160
- Nobody I know, I hope.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.260
- A college friend.
Corra.

40:16.260 --> 40:18.960
Her boyfriend, Rhys, he...

40:18.970 --> 40:22.330
He did a real number on her.

40:22.340 --> 40:25.440
And I didn't do anything.

40:29.310 --> 40:33.680
The law's got to change, mark.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.950
- Then change it.

40:39.990 --> 40:43.320
- Good morning, senators.
I'm here to speak to you

40:43.320 --> 40:46.290
about the
Illinois murder statute,

40:46.290 --> 40:48.360
specifically how it should
include a situation

40:48.360 --> 40:51.460
in which one person,
using emotional abuse,

40:51.470 --> 40:55.530
causes another
to commit suicide.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.970
Let me tell you
about Lily Spencer.

40:58.970 --> 41:02.340
She was a bright, kind woman,

41:02.340 --> 41:04.410
<i>and a loving mother</i>

41:04.410 --> 41:06.650
<i>who did everything in her power</i>

41:06.650 --> 41:08.750
<i>to protect the future of her son</i>

41:08.750 --> 41:11.250
<i>from an abusive father.</i>

41:11.250 --> 41:13.720
- Peter stone.

41:13.720 --> 41:17.390
- Hi, corra.
- I can't believe it.

41:19.630 --> 41:22.290
Um, did something happen
with Rhys?

41:22.300 --> 41:27.270
- I wouldn't know.
Actually, i...

41:27.270 --> 41:31.240
I need to apologize
for something.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.010
- For what?

41:33.010 --> 41:35.070
- Do you mind if I come in?

41:36.510 --> 41:38.080
- I'll make coffee.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.410
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
