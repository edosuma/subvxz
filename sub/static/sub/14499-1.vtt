WEBVTT

02:57.763 --> 02:59.958
Don't forget Sunday, on the 15th.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.960
Eliseo is cooking.

03:02.768 --> 03:06.704
That's Marie's brother.
He's the sous chef at Saint Maxime's.

03:08.608 --> 03:12.066
You know, Kathy says that
California Nouvelle is finished.

03:12.912 --> 03:16.245
People want to go back to pot roast
and mashed potatoes.

03:16.749 --> 03:18.717
Saint Maxime's is not a joint...

03:19.118 --> 03:22.087
where the vegetables
look like baby doodoo.

03:41.140 --> 03:43.370
It's that sleazebag Duke.

03:58.991 --> 04:01.118
That kid looks like a minor to me.

04:02.695 --> 04:05.721
- Yeah.
- She looks the same age as my daughter.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.238
Let's go in.

04:56.349 --> 04:58.874
That little girl that just came in here,
which room?

04:58.985 --> 05:00.714
That would be which girl, sir?

05:02.455 --> 05:05.583
You try me, you'll wish
you were back in Mother India.

05:06.259 --> 05:07.351
211, sir!

05:08.894 --> 05:10.663
Thought I heard a scream in here.

05:10.763 --> 05:14.534
- Jesus Christ! Who the fuck are you?
- Get that kid over to Father Burke's.

05:14.634 --> 05:16.035
Fuck you and your badge!

05:16.135 --> 05:19.366
You can't come in here like that
and abuse somebody's privacy!

05:19.538 --> 05:22.405
- I'm going to take you down to the station.
- Bullshit I am!

05:30.549 --> 05:32.141
Motherfucking bitch!

05:32.585 --> 05:33.916
You fucking ass!

05:35.488 --> 05:38.924
Come on, fuckhead! Come on, fucker!

05:48.834 --> 05:50.563
You dirty bastard.

05:51.837 --> 05:54.032
You get pleasure from hurting kids.

05:55.408 --> 05:58.844
You're going to swear out a statement
that that shitbag Duke...

05:59.111 --> 06:00.635
brings those kids to you.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.776
I can't do that.
He'll blow the fucking whistle on me!

06:08.120 --> 06:12.250
In that case, you're going to feel what
it's like to be one of those little kids!

06:24.970 --> 06:27.632
I don't think I'm going to be able
to eat tonight.

06:28.307 --> 06:31.276
What's wrong?
That awful guy Tovar picking on you again?

06:33.579 --> 06:35.069
It's the job, Kathleen.

06:36.449 --> 06:37.780
It's the job.

06:41.354 --> 06:43.618
It's the rotten people, it's the filth.

06:45.658 --> 06:47.455
I'm getting to be just like them.

06:49.462 --> 06:50.793
Don't ever say that.

06:52.498 --> 06:56.195
I feel like walking away
from this damn job now!

06:57.069 --> 06:58.331
And give it all up?

06:58.771 --> 07:02.036
The security, the seniority, the pension?

07:03.008 --> 07:05.408
You know the idea
you and me were talking about?

07:06.078 --> 07:10.378
Buying the little place up in Carmel,
maybe like a tavern. We could do that.

07:10.950 --> 07:12.815
We could make a go of it, you know.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.010
I did something today.

07:19.258 --> 07:21.317
I did something stupid.

07:21.827 --> 07:23.658
It might jeopardize my pension.

07:26.098 --> 07:27.360
Is Rios involved?

07:28.467 --> 07:30.492
No, and I can't tell him.

07:33.839 --> 07:37.070
I know you didn't lie, you didn't steal...

07:37.443 --> 07:39.035
and it's not about drugs.

07:39.912 --> 07:42.748
So I think somebody
just got your Irish up...

07:42.848 --> 07:46.750
and you handled it
in an extra-departmental manner.

07:48.587 --> 07:51.557
- You always try to make me feel better.
- Yes.

07:51.657 --> 07:53.249
And you do. Thanks.

08:11.710 --> 08:13.678
Good evening, gentlemen.

08:15.114 --> 08:18.982
Remember, please,
we try not to speak Japanese in class.

08:20.019 --> 08:22.283
Now then, Hada-San, would you join me?

08:28.294 --> 08:30.228
No bows, Mr. Hada.

08:30.396 --> 08:34.025
Remember, bows make Westerners
very uncomfortable.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.464
Just a handshake.

08:36.501 --> 08:38.971
- Very good, Mr. Hada.
- Very good.

08:39.071 --> 08:41.073
Very good. Yes, indeed. Thank you.

08:41.173 --> 08:44.744
Now then, we shall assume that
we are in the Los Angeles offices...

08:44.844 --> 08:47.039
of the General Electric Corporation.

08:47.246 --> 08:50.483
I'm a Mr. Jones,
who has invited you for lunch. Shall we?

08:50.583 --> 08:51.675
Okay.

08:52.418 --> 08:54.682
Mr. Hada, how are you?

08:55.354 --> 08:57.219
Hello, Mr. Jones!

08:57.990 --> 08:58.990
My...

09:00.826 --> 09:02.461
bowels are not good.

09:02.561 --> 09:03.926
No.

09:04.263 --> 09:06.663
Please, understand, Mr. Hada...

09:06.866 --> 09:09.435
that the phrase,
"How are you, Mr. Hada?"...

09:09.535 --> 09:13.596
does not require an answer,
other than, "How are you, Mr. Jones?"

09:14.173 --> 09:16.642
Because neither Mr. Jones
nor any other American...

09:16.742 --> 09:19.905
gives a damn about your health,
your family, or your problems.

09:20.713 --> 09:24.114
And you cannot ever speak of bowels...

09:24.583 --> 09:26.175
in polite society.

09:28.621 --> 09:32.557
Things that occur below the belt,
or below the obi for that matter...

09:32.992 --> 09:34.960
may be perfectly natural in Japan.

09:35.294 --> 09:37.125
But they are kinjite...

09:37.563 --> 09:41.124
forbidden subjects, in the West.

09:55.314 --> 09:56.440
No...

09:57.116 --> 09:59.380
I have an hour's ride home.

10:00.252 --> 10:01.344
Please...

10:02.454 --> 10:04.718
rest well, everybody.

10:05.758 --> 10:07.157
Until tomorrow, then.

10:11.664 --> 10:13.365
Good night.

10:13.465 --> 10:14.932
Good night.

10:29.081 --> 10:32.676
I like you coming in here
with your dictionary, like a student.

10:33.319 --> 10:34.946
And you like students?

10:35.154 --> 10:37.315
It was a student who made me a woman.

10:37.790 --> 10:40.987
I was afraid, and he was so strong.

10:41.894 --> 10:44.158
You can have
your student again, Nobu-Chan.

10:45.097 --> 10:47.292
Let me sleep with you tonight.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.393
You've had too much to drink, Hada-San.

10:51.437 --> 10:53.928
I don't want to spend the night
watching you sleep.

10:55.674 --> 10:57.505
Don't put me off, Nobu-Chan.

11:02.314 --> 11:06.216
I am perfectly capable.

11:21.433 --> 11:22.866
Good night, Hada-San.

12:43.649 --> 12:45.207
They're at it again.

12:45.984 --> 12:48.754
It's mother's fault. Father is a man.

12:48.854 --> 12:50.981
He should not be criticized all the time.

12:51.323 --> 12:53.814
It's his business
that keeps him out late at night.

12:53.926 --> 12:58.329
Mother does not want him drinking,
or spending time with bargirls.

12:59.064 --> 13:01.157
That's called business entertainment.

13:01.667 --> 13:05.603
That's why we have a nice home.
That's why we go skiing in the winter.

13:07.773 --> 13:10.970
You are going through the motions
of being a dutiful wife.

13:11.910 --> 13:13.673
But there is no kindness to it.

13:14.747 --> 13:16.548
Without looking at you...

13:16.648 --> 13:18.946
I can see the disapproval on your face.

13:19.952 --> 13:23.183
Your parents did you no favor
sending you to a Christian school.

13:24.256 --> 13:27.555
The teacher filled your head
with nonsense about sin and guilt...

13:27.826 --> 13:31.318
and with fables, which, in Japan,
we confine in the children's books.

13:32.064 --> 13:34.396
But of obligations,
they taught you nothing.

13:35.334 --> 13:37.996
I have fulfilled my obligations to you...

13:38.270 --> 13:40.795
to the girls,
to the company and to the country.

13:43.475 --> 13:46.239
I know you are a good provider...

13:47.346 --> 13:49.541
but it is this filth I cannot stand.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.210
You, a father, hiding this dirt.

13:54.086 --> 13:56.919
It makes me afraid
of your sexual thoughts.

13:59.892 --> 14:02.087
These are adult comic books, Kazuko.

14:02.294 --> 14:05.024
Men read them on the train,
and in the office.

14:06.331 --> 14:09.926
As to my sexual thoughts,
they shouldn't frighten you.

14:11.069 --> 14:13.503
You rarely give me
an opportunity to share them.

14:15.707 --> 14:16.707
But then...

14:18.043 --> 14:21.137
your sexual gifts are few and bitter.

14:41.934 --> 14:42.992
I am sorry.

14:44.503 --> 14:45.970
Please, forgive me.

15:25.277 --> 15:26.478
Hi, Daddy.

15:26.578 --> 15:29.911
You know Vinnie.
He plays basketball for St. Ambrose.

15:30.415 --> 15:31.905
Nice to see you again, sir.

15:32.150 --> 15:34.084
You know it's after 11:00?

15:35.487 --> 15:37.216
Don't athletes need their sleep?

15:38.824 --> 15:41.349
And so do 15-year-old schoolgirls.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.420
Parochial-school schoolgirls.

16:00.245 --> 16:04.773
Why do we send her to a parochial school?
The nuns don't teach her anything.

16:05.050 --> 16:08.315
You know, she's down there
in the dark with that stud.

16:08.921 --> 16:10.322
Why does that disturb you?

16:10.422 --> 16:13.448
Would you rather she were
in the back seat of a car somewhere?

16:14.192 --> 16:17.161
What's wrong with Vince?
He's a very nice young man.

16:18.664 --> 16:20.131
What got you upset?

16:20.599 --> 16:24.467
His buttons open? His zipper at half-mast?

16:24.736 --> 16:28.672
Do you have to paint pictures?
That's our daughter we're talking about.

16:32.577 --> 16:35.614
Second down and 15
at the Cobras' 15-yard line.

16:35.714 --> 16:37.841
Mike Mendoza now at quarterback.

16:40.986 --> 16:45.457
Pass complete to Joe Kelly,
first down at the Chicago 20-yard line.

16:45.557 --> 16:47.718
Durwood Broadmore made the stop.

16:57.803 --> 17:01.967
This is a waste of time.
We'll never get anything inside this place.

17:02.207 --> 17:04.471
Keep your zipper up, man.
It's still early.

17:05.444 --> 17:10.040
Mendoza to Wade Hawkins.
Tackle made by the Bruisers' Carl Haygins.

17:10.915 --> 17:13.146
Check out the little girl in Section 3.

17:18.924 --> 17:22.361
Five yards for the score
by running back Wimpy Pal.

17:22.461 --> 17:25.521
Touchdown Los Angeles Cobras!

17:27.432 --> 17:28.626
Lavonne...

17:30.335 --> 17:32.428
I want you to see something.

17:32.971 --> 17:34.996
Section C, Aisle 3.

17:40.379 --> 17:42.279
She's making my hormone count soar.

17:45.317 --> 17:46.716
Who's the ugly bastard?

17:47.152 --> 17:49.552
That's Crowe from Vice.

17:49.654 --> 17:51.849
The guy that's been
fucking up my business.

18:00.999 --> 18:04.594
And the pass is intercepted by Wimpy Pal.

18:05.303 --> 18:09.262
Penalty flag on the play.
Offside is charged against the Bruisers.

18:18.183 --> 18:19.207
Let's go.

18:21.853 --> 18:25.152
Pendahos on to attempt
a 20-yard field goal.

18:29.428 --> 18:32.397
You're really lucky
to have a great guy like that for a dad.

18:32.864 --> 18:33.922
I know it.

18:34.232 --> 18:36.564
But sometimes he can be really extreme.

18:37.169 --> 18:40.696
When he's like that, my mom says,
"It's Crowe against the world."

18:44.776 --> 18:47.040
Wait, I forgot to ask my dad for drinks.

18:47.279 --> 18:48.803
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

18:50.348 --> 18:53.215
Hey, Crowe, you sly dog.

18:53.351 --> 18:57.219
You like young pussy, don't you?
I saw you sitting with a poon pie.

18:58.657 --> 19:01.693
She's worth $5,000 a week, man.
Put her on the streets.

19:01.793 --> 19:03.590
Yeah, man, you can make a fortune.

19:12.404 --> 19:16.101
He is extreme. No question about it.

19:54.746 --> 19:56.611
There you go, Father.

19:58.683 --> 20:01.846
- They're still warm. From Joe's Deli?
- Where else?

20:04.456 --> 20:05.889
You spoil me shamefully.

20:06.258 --> 20:09.455
Here's the week's heartbreak,
believed to be in the area...

20:10.896 --> 20:12.363
an 11-year-old boy...

20:13.565 --> 20:15.226
a retarded girl of 17.

20:16.234 --> 20:18.464
That's my offering.
What have you got for me?

20:19.371 --> 20:21.737
We have a 14-year-old
brought in last night...

20:22.174 --> 20:24.108
been in town for 72 hours.

20:24.576 --> 20:28.034
Picked up at the bus terminal,
gang-raped, sodomized...

20:28.313 --> 20:30.281
and working the streets the next day.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.847
I don't think she's ready
to face the cops.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.185
I respect the way you feel, Father,
but I got pressure from the top.

20:38.924 --> 20:41.324
When a kid shows up,
they want to know about it.

23:58.890 --> 24:00.517
She was beautiful.

24:01.192 --> 24:04.457
Haunting, to be more accurate.
And let me tell you...

24:04.863 --> 24:08.264
she was having an orgasm!

24:08.600 --> 24:11.433
Are you sure you're not just
wishing an orgasm on her?

24:11.536 --> 24:14.937
If she wasn't enjoying it,
why didn't she cry for help? Tell me that.

24:15.874 --> 24:19.071
Because she is not some bargirl
who knows how to deal with men.

24:20.178 --> 24:21.338
Because of shame.

24:21.813 --> 24:25.374
Better humiliation, than the shame
of telling others she's been touched.

24:25.483 --> 24:27.383
That is the Japanese way, isn't it?

24:27.519 --> 24:29.851
- Maybe you're right.
- I am right.

24:30.321 --> 24:34.621
And now, I will give you some information
that will place you in my debt.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.928
Then I might not want to hear it.

24:38.029 --> 24:39.257
Yes, you will.

24:39.564 --> 24:43.557
For three years you're going to be forced
to watch the home games of the Dodgers.

24:45.336 --> 24:47.566
A transfer to the Los Angeles office?

24:51.376 --> 24:53.241
I'm indebted to you, deeply.

24:53.678 --> 24:55.339
- To America!
- To America!

25:57.542 --> 26:00.909
You are making a major mistake.
You've got nothing on me.

26:01.112 --> 26:04.377
- I suggest that you get out before I...
- Before you call a cop.

26:06.451 --> 26:08.919
You and me, we're going to take a drive.

26:09.020 --> 26:12.956
You give me a hard time,
I'm going to blow off your kneecaps.

26:15.093 --> 26:16.253
Drive.

26:31.109 --> 26:32.599
What kind of shit is this?

26:34.245 --> 26:36.213
Take me in, so I can call my lawyer.

26:37.215 --> 26:40.378
This has nothing to do with lawyers,
nor the department.

26:40.885 --> 26:45.322
You make a living selling little kids. I
make a living stopping pissheads like you.

26:45.924 --> 26:50.418
This is just between you and me,
and I'm going to put you out of business.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.407
What the hell
have you brought me here for?

27:09.247 --> 27:12.341
- You'll find out.
- Look, I think you're a little bit unstable.

27:12.684 --> 27:15.016
You've got a wife
and a couple of kids, right?

27:15.386 --> 27:16.580
What do you make?

27:17.255 --> 27:18.779
About $35,000?

27:23.861 --> 27:26.159
This is a President with a diamond face.

27:26.331 --> 27:28.390
$25,000...

27:29.701 --> 27:31.100
at Tiffany's.

27:32.604 --> 27:35.300
It's yours,
and we never see each other again.

27:40.845 --> 27:45.339
I'd like to shove this up your ass,
but I don't want to dirty my hands.

27:51.089 --> 27:52.454
You're going to eat it.

27:52.857 --> 27:55.382
You're going to eat it,
or I'll blow your head off.

27:55.593 --> 27:57.857
Open up your mouth!

28:13.077 --> 28:14.305
I'm dying.

28:17.582 --> 28:19.174
No, you're not.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.647
But you'll have to stick your head
between your legs to tell the time.

28:44.609 --> 28:45.667
Now what?

28:46.077 --> 28:47.203
Just watch.

29:04.028 --> 29:05.928
Fucking bastard!

29:07.031 --> 29:08.199
Why?

29:08.299 --> 29:09.357
Why, man?

29:11.469 --> 29:12.959
Nothing personal, Duke.

29:13.404 --> 29:15.133
It's a question of ethics.

29:15.339 --> 29:18.365
Should a man enjoy a $20,000 car...

29:18.543 --> 29:22.206
bought by the efforts of teenage girls
on their knees and backs?

29:24.649 --> 29:27.641
You're going to stop running
these little girls, Duke...

29:27.885 --> 29:29.785
because if you don't, you're dead.

29:30.755 --> 29:32.245
Dead in the gutter, dead.

29:37.328 --> 29:40.832
You're a mad dog! I shoot mad dogs!

29:40.932 --> 29:43.332
I blow their fucking guts out!

29:43.701 --> 29:45.931
Colorful, but dangerous.

30:15.967 --> 30:18.299
Swimmers, take your marks.

30:47.231 --> 30:48.721
Come on, Rita.

31:00.845 --> 31:04.679
Way to go, Rita.
That's your personal best, 26.5.

31:05.316 --> 31:07.944
- I'm so proud of her.
- Me, too.

31:08.486 --> 31:10.681
Good job, Rita. How about some shots?

31:13.491 --> 31:14.719
Perfect.

31:18.696 --> 31:19.958
Great.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.876
Why the hell doesn't her coach
cover her up?

31:31.976 --> 31:34.308
Put a robe or something on her?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.607
She could catch her death of cold.

31:51.262 --> 31:52.797
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:52.897 --> 31:57.535
we will be arriving at Los Angeles
International Airport in 10 minutes...

31:57.635 --> 32:00.304
where the time is 9:15 a.m...

32:00.404 --> 32:02.565
and the temperature is 68 degrees.

32:03.107 --> 32:05.735
Thank you for flying All Nippon Airways.

32:58.195 --> 33:00.565
I'd rather go to an American school.

33:00.665 --> 33:04.897
I don't see how abacus drill and
calligraphy are going to help me in life.

33:06.237 --> 33:08.639
I think we are doing quite well
in the world...

33:08.739 --> 33:11.799
in spite of the educational system,
which you criticize.

33:12.176 --> 33:14.167
Come, let's go to school.

33:14.779 --> 33:17.771
An abacus can calculate
as fast as a computer.

33:18.382 --> 33:21.715
As for calligraphy,
it is part of our heritage.

33:22.353 --> 33:25.720
How would you write your
New Year's resolutions? On a typewriter?

33:27.758 --> 33:30.328
You should listen
to your older sister, Se-Chan.

33:30.428 --> 33:32.293
You're too impulsive.

33:33.264 --> 33:36.597
I'll be late tonight.
I'm taking a client out for dinner.

34:48.105 --> 34:49.473
What do you think?

34:49.572 --> 34:51.475
I think they're right off the bus...

34:51.574 --> 34:53.811
no place to go,
hungry and scared shitless...

34:53.911 --> 34:56.038
now that they're in the big city.

34:56.981 --> 35:00.144
Let me off at the next corner.
I'll make my move.

35:01.018 --> 35:03.554
Question is, how do I get rid of the boy?

35:03.654 --> 35:06.791
Get rid of your sexist attitude.
That boy is sweet.

35:06.891 --> 35:11.157
There's a clientele for that.
Plenty of rich asshole bandits around.

35:11.829 --> 35:15.162
Get them both and diversify.
Part of your new operation.

35:41.892 --> 35:44.759
Forget about the kids.
Do exactly like I say.

36:27.905 --> 36:30.608
I'm not interested
in your ballistics expertise.

36:30.708 --> 36:34.111
I'm interested in that glaring blank
in your report...

36:34.211 --> 36:37.515
like who the hell is out there
gunning for the both of you, and why?

36:37.615 --> 36:41.652
It's not Joey Kaplan they're after.
The man was a paragon of virtue.

36:41.752 --> 36:43.481
We know, Captain.

36:43.787 --> 36:47.154
Joey Kaplan died for your sins.
Now that's it, isn't it?

36:47.525 --> 36:50.761
Please, Captain, we make a lot of enemies.

36:50.861 --> 36:53.694
No, Eddie. Even thieves like you.

36:54.498 --> 36:56.398
It's not we, it's me.

36:57.334 --> 36:58.803
I make a lot of enemies.

36:58.903 --> 37:01.739
Perhaps you'd favor us
with a list of your enemies?

37:01.839 --> 37:03.207
Who's your number one?

37:03.307 --> 37:06.435
Since May 23, it's a pimp called Duke.

37:06.844 --> 37:09.369
He runs little girls for wealthy perverts.

37:09.580 --> 37:14.108
So why's May 23 so ingrained
in that fine mind of yours?

37:14.518 --> 37:17.955
It was May 23 I set his Cadillac on fire.

37:18.055 --> 37:21.786
And on May 23,
I made him swallow a big gold watch.

37:21.959 --> 37:24.393
A President. It has a diamond face.

37:24.862 --> 37:28.127
I think they sell for $25,000.

37:28.732 --> 37:30.868
What are you, completely crazy?

37:30.968 --> 37:33.370
You can't bust the scumbag
like any other cop.

37:33.470 --> 37:36.740
No, you've got to exact
a biblical vengeance.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.037
I mean, who appointed you
avenger of my department?

37:40.177 --> 37:42.079
Who gave you a flaming sword?

37:42.179 --> 37:45.979
Captain, this bag of shit
is running little girls.

37:46.650 --> 37:47.650
Babies.

37:47.785 --> 37:49.553
And he's getting fat off them.

37:49.653 --> 37:52.490
If I haul him in,
he's back out on the street in 30 minutes.

37:52.590 --> 37:54.125
What are we supposed to do?

37:54.225 --> 37:57.795
Obey the regulations
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

37:57.895 --> 37:59.055
Now get out.

38:05.069 --> 38:06.696
- Crowe.
- Yes, sir.

38:08.305 --> 38:12.105
If you were into me for $50,000,
I'd come after you myself.

38:37.668 --> 38:40.364
So, Hada-San, America's not so different?

38:43.307 --> 38:45.639
No. Hands off.

38:47.411 --> 38:50.014
Hada-San, you must learn the rule...

38:50.114 --> 38:53.651
touching hostess' breast
definitely not permitted in Los Angeles.

38:53.751 --> 38:56.811
Not permitted? How sad.

38:57.354 --> 38:59.379
- Why not?
- City regulation.

38:59.890 --> 39:03.382
I think there are
too many regulations in America.

39:03.527 --> 39:07.224
It makes for good balance,
drink in one hand...

39:07.898 --> 39:10.093
breast in the other.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.774
Partner...

39:20.377 --> 39:22.902
I think I've had too much
to drink tonight.

39:33.724 --> 39:36.393
- I had a lot of fun at the ballet.
- It was really fun.

39:36.493 --> 39:37.895
The music, wasn't it good?

39:37.995 --> 39:40.331
- Let's go again.
- Sure. When are we gonna go?

39:40.431 --> 39:42.666
I don't know. Let's ask Sister Dominique.

39:42.766 --> 39:45.633
She's really nice,
she'll probably let us go again.

40:07.558 --> 40:09.960
We've got to go to the sale.
We've got to go.

40:10.060 --> 40:12.585
- Yeah, I've been saving, so...
- Good.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.601
- P is for party
- A is for all right

40:26.810 --> 40:29.335
- R is for rowdy
- T is for tonight

40:29.680 --> 40:32.816
- Y is for you
- And you know what to do

40:32.916 --> 40:34.885
I said, party

40:34.985 --> 40:36.487
Don't let your momma know

40:36.587 --> 40:38.122
Party

40:38.222 --> 40:39.723
Or she won't let you go

40:39.823 --> 40:41.654
Party

40:59.743 --> 41:02.507
- P is for party
- A is for all right

41:03.947 --> 41:06.541
- R is for rowdy
- T is for tonight

41:07.918 --> 41:10.944
- Y is for you
- And you know what to do

41:11.688 --> 41:13.157
I said, party

41:13.257 --> 41:14.858
Don't let your momma know

41:14.958 --> 41:16.619
Party

41:16.894 --> 41:18.020
Party

41:33.777 --> 41:35.112
What happened, Rita?

41:35.212 --> 41:37.581
Some Oriental guy
touched my holy of holies.

41:37.681 --> 41:39.046
Holy shit!

41:40.884 --> 41:43.387
- What's the matter, Rita?
- Some pervert touched her.

41:43.487 --> 41:45.955
- Who?
- Some Oriental guy.

41:46.457 --> 41:48.425
Was it one of these shitheads?

42:11.081 --> 42:13.879
The cash, the plastic, and the Seiko, now.

42:36.206 --> 42:37.708
Can you spell that for me?

42:37.808 --> 42:40.003
P-U-R-R...

42:40.143 --> 42:42.976
G-l-N-H-E-N.

42:44.348 --> 42:48.682
All right.
Now, Rita, I know it's difficult, but...

42:49.052 --> 42:53.580
have you some way of knowing
if he was Japanese, Chinese, or Korean?

42:54.324 --> 42:55.951
How can you tell?

42:56.527 --> 42:59.223
All I know is that he was not really old.

43:00.797 --> 43:02.662
He looks...

43:04.468 --> 43:06.163
He looks like...

43:06.670 --> 43:08.331
Like me? Why not?

43:09.940 --> 43:12.670
All Asians share a superficial likeness.

43:13.176 --> 43:15.007
How was he dressed, Rita?

43:15.145 --> 43:18.148
Would you say he was a working man,
or a businessman?

43:18.248 --> 43:22.386
I meant, was he in a suit and tie,
or in sweats, or in a windbreaker?

43:22.486 --> 43:24.321
He was in a suit, all right...

43:24.421 --> 43:27.754
with a white shirt and a tie,
like a banker, you know, on TV.

43:29.092 --> 43:31.195
Now, Rita, think real hard.

43:31.295 --> 43:32.990
What else did you notice?

43:34.064 --> 43:36.934
Wristwatch, pocket handkerchief,
briefcase, a camera?

43:37.034 --> 43:38.869
There was something.

43:38.969 --> 43:42.166
He wore a little button
in his lapel. Here.

43:42.573 --> 43:45.064
Describe it, Rita, think real hard.

43:45.642 --> 43:47.132
It was shiny...

43:47.477 --> 43:50.207
maybe red or blue...

43:51.582 --> 43:54.050
Gosh, I don't know. I'm really sorry.

43:54.818 --> 43:56.683
It gives us a better idea.

43:56.787 --> 44:00.157
The big Japanese companies have their
employees wear their logos.

44:00.257 --> 44:01.825
That really narrows it down.

44:01.925 --> 44:05.128
How many Japanese businessmen
do you think there are in the city...

44:05.228 --> 44:06.430
at any one time?

44:06.530 --> 44:09.522
According to the LA Times, about 25,000.

44:11.034 --> 44:13.730
I wish I could tell you how it happened.

44:14.605 --> 44:16.835
You need not tell me anything.

44:17.608 --> 44:20.338
All that matters is that you are at home.

44:23.347 --> 44:24.746
Sometimes...

44:25.582 --> 44:28.642
I think you are
much more capable than I...

44:30.354 --> 44:32.254
that you are a better person.

44:53.343 --> 44:56.039
This is how the Chinese emperors slept.

44:57.514 --> 44:58.913
No quilt...

44:59.783 --> 45:02.251
and only young women to cover them.

45:04.054 --> 45:05.817
How wise they were.

45:07.257 --> 45:09.953
Where do you learn these wicked things?

45:11.361 --> 45:14.091
You ask too many questions, Kazuko-Chan.

46:24.334 --> 46:25.858
Why, Hiroshi?

46:27.037 --> 46:29.528
The first time after so many years?

46:32.409 --> 46:33.535
Maybe...

46:35.512 --> 46:37.912
because we are so vulnerable here.

47:01.505 --> 47:04.374
Somebody cops a feel off Rita on the bus.

47:04.474 --> 47:08.512
Nothing happened, and you're behaving
like she was raped or something.

47:08.612 --> 47:10.781
Some sleazy Oriental...

47:10.881 --> 47:13.543
gropes my daughter,
and you say nothing happened?

47:13.884 --> 47:15.118
My daughter?

47:15.218 --> 47:18.155
Maybe you don't realize
what's going on in this country...

47:18.255 --> 47:20.257
but take the Japanese, for instance...

47:20.357 --> 47:23.727
they're buying hotels,
office buildings, golf courses.

47:23.827 --> 47:25.362
They're taking over.

47:25.462 --> 47:29.262
You and me, we're busting our ass,
and then we suck hind tit.

47:29.699 --> 47:31.802
What the hell's going on up here?

47:31.902 --> 47:35.133
You see what I mean?
Taking over. Look at that.

47:43.313 --> 47:44.905
Move this car!

47:45.315 --> 47:48.113
What the hell do you think this is,
a parking lot?

47:48.385 --> 47:51.188
You are double-parked. Do you understand?

47:51.288 --> 47:54.985
I'm going to throw your ass in jail,
if you don't move this car now.

47:56.293 --> 47:58.495
What the hell are you looking at?

47:58.595 --> 48:01.325
You people behave like you own this town.

48:01.698 --> 48:04.690
Well, this is not Tokyo,
this is Los Angeles.

48:05.969 --> 48:07.270
You over there!

48:07.370 --> 48:09.539
You're obstructing the sidewalk...

48:09.639 --> 48:13.632
and your goddamn cars
are obstructing the thoroughfare.

48:13.777 --> 48:16.012
And you're fucking obstructing me!

48:16.112 --> 48:19.240
I apologize. He's not feeling too well.

48:21.351 --> 48:23.478
Come on, partner, let's go.

48:29.459 --> 48:31.256
What's troubling you?

48:35.165 --> 48:40.068
It's about this rage that I feel
ever since Rita was...

48:41.805 --> 48:42.805
molested.

48:45.709 --> 48:48.337
These thoughts
that I have that plague me...

48:49.412 --> 48:53.041
I have this feeling of revenge
that's eating my gut.

48:54.517 --> 48:57.577
From what you've told me,
Rita was pawed on the bus.

48:57.721 --> 49:01.487
Ugly as the experience was for her,
"molest" seems too strong a term...

49:01.625 --> 49:04.327
and implies something
that never actually happened.

49:04.427 --> 49:06.827
I detect a possessiveness, Crowe.

49:06.997 --> 49:09.557
Rita is your daughter,
she's not your wife.

49:10.133 --> 49:13.904
I want to be sure it is a father's anger
I'm witnessing, if you follow me.

49:14.004 --> 49:16.370
I know what you're saying, Father.

49:18.008 --> 49:20.875
- I'm not sure I can face it.
- Listen to me.

49:21.378 --> 49:24.438
We are all beset by demons.
Every one of us.

49:25.115 --> 49:28.175
And it's up to you to recognize
what's bothering you.

49:28.418 --> 49:30.487
Know your enemy, so to speak.

49:30.587 --> 49:35.251
Deal with this in a forthright manner,
and you'll be back in a state of grace.

49:35.692 --> 49:39.822
May the God of Justice and Mercy
strengthen your soul.

49:43.633 --> 49:44.725
Exemplary.

49:48.405 --> 49:50.635
Don't hold the brush so stiff.

49:53.610 --> 49:55.100
Is this right?

49:56.212 --> 49:59.375
You missed the upward stroke
on the right-hand side.

50:07.290 --> 50:10.589
It's almost right.
Only the water radical is weak.

50:11.728 --> 50:12.888
Where?

50:14.998 --> 50:16.761
On the first stroke.

50:19.469 --> 50:21.699
Think of ocean spray, not of ink.

50:25.608 --> 50:27.940
Okay, everyone, class dismissed.

50:28.211 --> 50:30.771
I'll see everyone back here
in half an hour.

50:35.251 --> 50:37.354
Hello, ladies. What would you like today?

50:37.454 --> 50:38.855
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream.

50:38.955 --> 50:41.191
- What did you say you wanted?
- Strawberry.

50:41.291 --> 50:44.454
Strawberry. There you go. Enjoy.

51:34.544 --> 51:35.909
Follow her.

51:45.922 --> 51:48.191
Come on, Fumi-Chan,
the school bell's ringing.

51:48.291 --> 51:50.282
I know. I won't be late.

52:43.546 --> 52:47.083
Hello, little girl.
Will you show me where your school is?

52:47.183 --> 52:49.452
I have an appointment
with your headmistress.

52:49.552 --> 52:51.076
Yes, of course.

53:41.037 --> 53:44.268
- Why have you brought me here?
- I just forgot some papers.

53:46.376 --> 53:48.276
It'll only be a moment.

53:52.282 --> 53:55.410
This is where I live. It's nice, isn't it?

54:22.478 --> 54:24.105
You like my home?

54:24.514 --> 54:25.845
It's nice.

54:30.453 --> 54:31.888
Please, please.

54:31.988 --> 54:34.657
I just had my physical,
and my blood pressure is up...

54:34.757 --> 54:37.627
so no surprises, please.

54:37.727 --> 54:39.251
Just listen up.

54:39.929 --> 54:41.431
Japanese Middle School.

54:41.531 --> 54:44.400
One of those private schools
off Echo Park?

54:44.500 --> 54:46.102
- You guys know it?
- Yeah.

54:46.202 --> 54:48.170
Missing female juvenile.

54:48.438 --> 54:50.838
Could be nothing, but...

54:51.574 --> 54:54.978
from what I read, these Japanese
school kids, they don't play hooky.

54:55.078 --> 54:57.342
They go to school six days a week...

54:57.714 --> 54:59.614
do four hours of homework...

55:00.650 --> 55:02.880
sleep maybe six hours a night.

55:03.019 --> 55:06.182
Instead of vacations,
they enroll in cram courses.

55:07.190 --> 55:11.024
Anyway, get on over there.
There could be diplomatic implications.

55:12.295 --> 55:16.900
Could you replace me with somebody who's
more sympathetic to the Asian community?

55:17.000 --> 55:19.869
Excuse me, it's because of
what happened to his daughter.

55:19.969 --> 55:22.172
Rita? What happened?

55:22.272 --> 55:24.541
She was molested on the bus by an Asian.

55:24.641 --> 55:28.011
Molested? Look, this is the real world.
We don't use euphemisms.

55:28.111 --> 55:30.204
Abused? Raped? What?

55:31.247 --> 55:34.951
She was on a bus and somebody
stuck their hand up under her skirt and...

55:35.051 --> 55:36.319
touched her.

55:36.419 --> 55:38.546
You know, her private parts.

55:38.755 --> 55:39.983
Touched?

55:42.125 --> 55:45.094
My nephew Stevie was touched
by the priest in choir practice.

55:45.194 --> 55:47.958
Now, what the hell has that got to do
with your work?

55:48.498 --> 55:52.268
In this city, you want to get racially
selective in your assignments?

55:52.368 --> 55:56.771
You don't want to do Blacks and Hispanics,
Iranians, Vietnamese or Chinamen?

55:57.507 --> 56:00.203
You want to do Anglo-Saxons. Good.

56:00.943 --> 56:04.902
You can walk a beat in Glendale,
as a patrolman. Now beat it.

57:08.044 --> 57:10.613
Excuse me for asking obvious questions.

57:10.713 --> 57:13.783
Does your daughter have any friends
in the Los Angeles area...

57:13.883 --> 57:15.585
who do not attend this school?

57:15.685 --> 57:18.984
No, we have only been in the city
for three months.

57:19.622 --> 57:22.859
Does she have any boyfriends?
Is there a young man that...

57:22.959 --> 57:24.950
No, that is not possible.

57:25.795 --> 57:26.853
Why?

57:27.964 --> 57:30.797
Because Fumiko is our daughter...

57:31.834 --> 57:33.802
and she is just a young girl.

57:35.071 --> 57:38.507
Japanese young girls do not...

57:39.542 --> 57:41.911
Japanese young girls do not what?

57:42.011 --> 57:43.478
Let me recap.

57:43.913 --> 57:46.282
There have been no arguments at home.

57:46.382 --> 57:48.818
She doesn't know anybody in the area.

57:48.918 --> 57:50.442
She's not precocious.

57:50.753 --> 57:53.156
Could there be someone in Tokyo
that she misses?

57:53.256 --> 57:56.191
Mr. Rios, let me explain.

57:57.026 --> 57:59.085
It is different in Japan.

57:59.395 --> 58:03.525
Our children have not the latitude
of American children.

58:04.634 --> 58:08.866
A daughter like Fumiko-San
would be an innocent.

58:48.311 --> 58:49.642
The tongue.

59:02.124 --> 59:03.614
Do you like it?

59:18.975 --> 59:21.307
We'll pass around copies of this.

59:30.420 --> 59:32.285
I think we ought to go.

59:38.361 --> 59:40.829
Do you have any instructions
for Mr. And Mrs. Hada?

59:41.197 --> 59:44.030
Yes. We want someone to be
at this number at all times.

59:44.434 --> 59:47.926
I'm sending Officer Petrini over here
to stand a telephone watch.

59:48.070 --> 59:49.070
You got that?

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:10.816
Am I glad we're out of there.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.752
I don't know how to deal
with that sobbing, tears and all.

01:00:15.665 --> 01:00:17.826
I thought these guys had balls of iron...

01:00:18.668 --> 01:00:20.932
you know, give your life
for the emperor...

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.400
committing hara-kiri, that kind of thing.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:27.507
Now don't make me out to be insensitive,
because I can imagine...

01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:30.403
being the father of a teenager...

01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:33.015
I can imagine how that guy must feel.

01:00:35.084 --> 01:00:36.574
Where do you want to start?

01:00:36.853 --> 01:00:40.152
I don't know yet,
but, Eddie, we've got to find that girl...

01:00:40.623 --> 01:00:42.784
even if we have to work
outside the system.

01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:45.717
Bear in mind that I intend
to retire on 20...

01:00:46.229 --> 01:00:49.164
and I have no plans
to be a Carmel saloon keeper.

01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:52.463
So let's not operate
too far out of the system.

01:01:08.651 --> 01:01:09.743
Voilà!

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:15.916
Baby-San.

01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:26.368
You're open for business.

01:01:31.908 --> 01:01:33.943
When can I go home? I want to go home.

01:01:34.043 --> 01:01:35.445
- Be nice!
- You promised.

01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:37.536
Be nice to this man! Do what he says!

01:01:37.647 --> 01:01:38.815
Then we'll talk.

01:01:38.915 --> 01:01:41.406
- But you promised!
- We'll talk about it!

01:01:42.184 --> 01:01:43.419
Now, come on!

01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.544
But you promised you'd let me go!

01:01:45.788 --> 01:01:47.619
My mother doesn't know where I am.

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:48.916
She'll be worried!

01:01:49.358 --> 01:01:51.155
- Please, let me go home!
- I will!

01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:53.262
All in good time. Now, get in there!

01:01:53.763 --> 01:01:55.025
- Let's go home!
- Easy.

01:01:55.464 --> 01:01:56.658
Sit down.

01:02:14.684 --> 01:02:16.515
Your school called me.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.014
They're very disappointed in your work.

01:02:20.623 --> 01:02:21.885
Very disappointed.

01:02:22.858 --> 01:02:26.487
The headmistress said
to me that you are tardy...

01:02:27.229 --> 01:02:28.423
slovenly...

01:02:28.731 --> 01:02:30.096
and impudent.

01:02:30.866 --> 01:02:34.199
I told her that I would
punish you severely.

01:02:35.504 --> 01:02:37.938
I wish it could have been otherwise.

01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:40.801
Driver.

01:02:46.949 --> 01:02:47.949
Let's go.

01:02:52.655 --> 01:02:56.250
Lieutenant Crowe, Fumiko Hada has been
spotted at the Palms Hotel.

01:02:57.226 --> 01:02:58.989
Okay. We're on our way.

01:03:17.179 --> 01:03:18.314
Good.

01:03:18.414 --> 01:03:19.676
That's it.

01:03:24.453 --> 01:03:26.045
Good. That's cool.

01:03:26.455 --> 01:03:27.854
Now hold it.

01:03:32.161 --> 01:03:34.823
Yeah, now make it feel good.
Touch her right there.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.667
Kill the playback.

01:03:40.569 --> 01:03:41.831
That's great.

01:03:42.838 --> 01:03:44.772
Yeah. And kill this light here, guys.

01:03:45.408 --> 01:03:46.409
Here you go.

01:03:46.509 --> 01:03:48.177
The rest of the set looks good.

01:03:48.277 --> 01:03:50.108
Lets clear out here, guys. Perfect.

01:03:50.346 --> 01:03:51.747
I'm rolling now.

01:03:51.847 --> 01:03:53.178
And, action! Playback!

01:04:03.092 --> 01:04:05.356
Little more smoke
in that shot there, Johnny?

01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:19.640
Open up! Police!

01:04:19.842 --> 01:04:21.070
That's the way.

01:04:21.677 --> 01:04:23.440
You got it now. Come on.

01:04:29.185 --> 01:04:31.210
Yes. Now, come on!

01:04:31.353 --> 01:04:32.479
Hey!

01:04:32.621 --> 01:04:33.823
Sid, it's the cops!

01:04:33.923 --> 01:04:35.322
Everybody, on the floor!

01:04:37.359 --> 01:04:39.452
- Look at all this shit!
- Now!

01:04:47.436 --> 01:04:48.835
Let's get out of here!

01:05:20.703 --> 01:05:23.001
Call the units. We'll take them in.

01:05:37.019 --> 01:05:38.486
That's not Fumiko!

01:05:41.123 --> 01:05:43.091
Get me Sergeant Thomas in Vice.

01:05:45.027 --> 01:05:48.190
The Japanese Chamber of Commerce
released the text of a letter...

01:05:48.397 --> 01:05:50.599
to the mayor's office
voicing apprehension...

01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:52.902
at the disappearance of Fumiko Hada...

01:05:53.002 --> 01:05:54.731
a Japanese high-school student.

01:05:55.004 --> 01:05:58.496
The letter voices fears
of foul play against the teenager.

01:05:58.774 --> 01:06:01.110
This comes among recent complaints
of violence...

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:03.644
Fumi-Chan!

01:06:04.914 --> 01:06:07.883
Can't stay here doing nothing!
I have to go look for her!

01:06:07.983 --> 01:06:09.951
Go with him, please! Quickly!

01:06:18.027 --> 01:06:19.662
Hey, come on inside!

01:06:19.762 --> 01:06:21.263
There's good stuff in here!

01:06:21.363 --> 01:06:23.666
Emmanuelle 4. Maid in Sweden.

01:06:23.766 --> 01:06:26.736
Bring her in, and you won't
have to use your hand tonight!

01:06:26.836 --> 01:06:28.437
You know it! All right!

01:06:28.537 --> 01:06:30.039
Come in! It's only $4.

01:06:30.139 --> 01:06:31.800
Come on. Get on up here!

01:06:31.907 --> 01:06:35.377
Hey, bring the little lady in.
You'll be coming like mad!

01:06:35.477 --> 01:06:38.881
You're old enough. I'll let you in.
I'll stick you in behind somebody!

01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:40.750
Fellas! Where you going?

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:43.444
Hey, fellas. Hey! Come on inside!

01:06:43.953 --> 01:06:46.989
Come on inside!
No fuckee-suckee like this in Tokyo!

01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:48.491
This be some young stuff!

01:06:48.591 --> 01:06:51.219
- Bug off!
- 9, 13! Oriental, too!

01:06:51.327 --> 01:06:52.851
You'll love it!

01:07:27.863 --> 01:07:29.125
Who lives here?

01:07:29.698 --> 01:07:30.995
Someone nice.

01:07:36.972 --> 01:07:40.430
Someone that I want you
to be very nice to.

01:07:48.717 --> 01:07:51.311
Duke told me you've just come from Tokyo.

01:07:52.288 --> 01:07:54.188
How very interesting.

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.521
How do you like it here?

01:07:57.192 --> 01:07:59.319
Have you made friends yet?

01:08:02.698 --> 01:08:04.723
Oh, poor darling.

01:08:04.967 --> 01:08:07.902
It must be hard to leave
your friends behind.

01:08:11.373 --> 01:08:13.238
When I was a little girl...

01:08:13.475 --> 01:08:15.568
that was a long time ago...

01:08:15.844 --> 01:08:18.938
my parents put me
in a boarding school in Paris.

01:08:19.848 --> 01:08:23.340
I can't tell you how lonely I felt
the first night...

01:08:24.586 --> 01:08:26.645
in that dreadful dormitory.

01:08:27.589 --> 01:08:29.613
How very, very lonely.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.823
You know Detective Crowe.

01:08:34.363 --> 01:08:37.433
Mr. Crowe is a friend of mine.
He needs your help.

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:40.194
I would appreciate it, but it's up to you.

01:08:40.301 --> 01:08:43.270
If you feel you're getting in
over your head, come and get me.

01:08:43.505 --> 01:08:45.131
I'll be in my office.

01:08:51.714 --> 01:08:53.113
DeeDee...

01:08:53.948 --> 01:08:57.850
a little girl has been snatched,
and I'd like to talk to Duke about it.

01:08:58.921 --> 01:09:01.754
I'd like to get that little girl
back to her parents.

01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:04.455
How do you know she wants to go back?

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.254
How do you know
she doesn't want to be with Duke...

01:09:07.395 --> 01:09:09.227
if it's Duke she's with?

01:09:09.497 --> 01:09:10.828
I know her parents.

01:09:10.933 --> 01:09:12.423
You don't know shit.

01:09:12.533 --> 01:09:15.002
I'd rather be with Duke
than with my parents.

01:09:15.636 --> 01:09:19.241
DeeDee, it was Duke who put you
out on the street.

01:09:19.341 --> 01:09:21.243
He made you turn tricks.

01:09:21.343 --> 01:09:22.832
Duke didn't turn me out.

01:09:23.278 --> 01:09:25.143
My stepfather did when I was 12.

01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:28.482
I did him and his friends
until I was 14 and ran away.

01:09:29.551 --> 01:09:32.220
All right, but it was Duke
who started you on drugs.

01:09:32.321 --> 01:09:33.810
He made you dependent.

01:09:33.956 --> 01:09:37.084
He did. But if he didn't,
somebody else would have.

01:09:37.593 --> 01:09:39.787
DeeDee, you know what Duke is.

01:09:40.395 --> 01:09:42.227
Why are you trying to protect him?

01:09:42.331 --> 01:09:43.854
Duke was good to me.

01:09:44.299 --> 01:09:46.062
He bought me nice clothes.

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:49.035
He took me to Jamaica.
We stayed in a classy hotel.

01:09:49.772 --> 01:09:52.764
I didn't have to hustle.
It was like being married.

01:09:54.076 --> 01:09:55.509
Did you love him?

01:09:55.711 --> 01:09:57.611
If that's what love is.

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:03.484
There's a little girl out there.

01:10:03.986 --> 01:10:05.817
She's never been away from home.

01:10:07.156 --> 01:10:09.750
I'd like to find her
and return her to her parents.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.961
Then I'm going to leave
all this behind me.

01:10:18.934 --> 01:10:20.765
Duke's a great dresser.

01:10:21.036 --> 01:10:22.901
He spends thousands on his clothes.

01:10:24.373 --> 01:10:26.208
He might have gone underground, or moved.

01:10:26.308 --> 01:10:29.835
But he would still go to Rosario's
to get his pants made, suits altered.

01:10:30.145 --> 01:10:31.169
Rosario's?

01:10:32.114 --> 01:10:35.413
He has a shop downtown.
They play dominos there at night.

01:10:35.984 --> 01:10:37.451
Duke used to take me there.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.217
That's all I'm going to tell you.

01:10:40.556 --> 01:10:41.750
Thanks, DeeDee.

01:11:37.312 --> 01:11:38.347
Rosario's.

01:11:38.447 --> 01:11:39.447
Mr. Rosario?

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:14.608
Don't settle down yet.
Our customer's arrived.

01:13:25.087 --> 01:13:26.850
Gentlemen, can I help you?

01:13:28.056 --> 01:13:30.425
Two of your tenants just drove in.

01:13:30.525 --> 01:13:33.562
A flashy dresser known as Duke,
and a heavyset man.

01:13:33.662 --> 01:13:34.730
Ring a bell?

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:37.633
We have 200 apartments.
You'll have to be more specific.

01:13:37.733 --> 01:13:39.530
Some detail, so I can help you.

01:13:39.701 --> 01:13:42.237
We think there's a Japanese juvenile
staying with him.

01:13:42.337 --> 01:13:44.106
Japanese? Well, let's see.

01:13:44.206 --> 01:13:47.767
We have a Matsuda, a Manabe, a Toyama...

01:13:49.878 --> 01:13:50.902
Hey!

01:13:57.119 --> 01:13:58.677
Listen, shitface.

01:13:58.887 --> 01:14:01.356
We're not fucking around!
What's the apartment number?

01:14:01.456 --> 01:14:03.185
Hey, don't get mad!

01:14:03.525 --> 01:14:05.360
You're looking for Apartment 906.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.950
Elevator's to your right.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.282
It's Lorenzo. Two cops on the way.

01:14:27.382 --> 01:14:29.316
- Get the fuck out!
- Thanks!

01:14:29.518 --> 01:14:31.453
- Fumiko, hurry up!
- She's in the bedroom.

01:14:31.553 --> 01:14:32.821
I can't get her out!

01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:35.224
Here's the last of the money.
Where is Fumiko?

01:14:35.324 --> 01:14:36.425
Get her!

01:14:36.525 --> 01:14:38.694
Take the back stairs,
and use Lorenzo's car.

01:14:38.794 --> 01:14:40.591
- I'll stall them, man!
- Hurry up!

01:14:41.263 --> 01:14:43.527
Leave the shit behind and let's go!

01:14:44.466 --> 01:14:46.593
Get your ass out here! You hear me, girl?

01:14:47.769 --> 01:14:49.100
Open the door, bitch.

01:14:49.705 --> 01:14:52.799
You better open up, or I'll kick your ass!
Hey, bitch!

01:14:53.008 --> 01:14:54.876
Hurry up, and open the fucking door!

01:14:54.976 --> 01:14:58.080
I'm gonna break your ass
if you don't hurry!

01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.442
Down the stairs!

01:15:11.193 --> 01:15:13.127
If you don't open up, I'm gonna...

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:29.032
You could've buzzed.

01:15:29.211 --> 01:15:30.872
On the floor, asshole.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:45.149
Tampico, Long Beach.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.089
This guy's into Mexican food!

01:15:47.295 --> 01:15:49.786
Police brutality is gonna blow your case.

01:15:50.265 --> 01:15:52.495
You've heard of
the overworked court system?

01:15:52.834 --> 01:15:54.267
There may not be a case.

01:15:54.703 --> 01:15:56.898
You tell us where Duke is,
we'll let you go.

01:15:57.973 --> 01:15:59.304
Duke is long gone.

01:16:00.742 --> 01:16:03.108
What about the girls? The Japanese kid?

01:16:03.545 --> 01:16:04.978
Duke is a salesman, right?

01:16:05.247 --> 01:16:07.875
When he goes on the road,
the inventory goes with him.

01:16:08.517 --> 01:16:10.280
You missed him by a pussy hair.

01:16:10.852 --> 01:16:12.444
Pussy. Get it?

01:16:15.223 --> 01:16:17.657
Let's throw that son of a bitch
off the balcony.

01:16:20.328 --> 01:16:21.730
You guys are bullshitting.

01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:25.061
Don't throw me over the balcony!
Jesus, take me back!

01:16:25.367 --> 01:16:27.769
No, Jesus, take me back!

01:16:27.869 --> 01:16:29.504
When you tell us where Duke is.

01:16:29.604 --> 01:16:32.266
I swear to God, I don't know!

01:16:34.042 --> 01:16:35.202
Wrong answer!

01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:40.876
Same question.

01:16:41.116 --> 01:16:43.218
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

01:16:43.318 --> 01:16:45.554
- Where?
- I swear to God, I don't know.

01:16:45.654 --> 01:16:48.256
I don't know!
Sweet Jesus, somebody's gotta help me!

01:16:48.356 --> 01:16:51.193
I'm slipping. Help me! I don't know!

01:16:51.293 --> 01:16:52.861
I swear to God, I don't know!

01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:54.996
I don't know! Bring me up!

01:16:55.096 --> 01:16:57.223
I'm slipping!

01:17:16.585 --> 01:17:17.882
Oh, no.

01:17:27.295 --> 01:17:29.661
What do we do with the boots?

01:17:37.038 --> 01:17:38.596
I am Fumiko Hada.

01:17:38.974 --> 01:17:40.839
I have caused you much trouble.

01:17:41.309 --> 01:17:42.970
I am so sorry.

01:18:17.145 --> 01:18:20.876
We have guests
from the not-so-mysterious Orient.

01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:23.185
Honey, would you get the door?

01:18:23.285 --> 01:18:25.150
Let's go fix up that room.

01:18:32.627 --> 01:18:36.256
Good morning, Mr. Crowe.
We are so sorry to disturb you.

01:18:36.731 --> 01:18:38.528
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:18:42.003 --> 01:18:43.766
- How are you?
- Okay.

01:18:48.109 --> 01:18:51.272
This is my wife Kathleen, my
daughter, Rita. Mr. And Mrs. Hada.

01:18:51.513 --> 01:18:53.815
Party, don't let your momma know

01:18:53.915 --> 01:18:56.611
Party, or she won't let you go

01:18:57.085 --> 01:18:58.553
Would you like to sit down?

01:18:58.653 --> 01:19:00.712
No, thank you. We have to leave soon.

01:19:01.923 --> 01:19:02.923
Thank you.

01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:06.488
Mr. Crowe, you have returned our daughter.

01:19:08.129 --> 01:19:10.256
And we want to thank you personally.

01:19:10.799 --> 01:19:15.259
So we took the liberty of asking
Captain Tovar for your address.

01:19:16.438 --> 01:19:18.565
It was very rude of us.

01:19:19.007 --> 01:19:20.770
Please, forgive the intrusion.

01:19:21.209 --> 01:19:24.076
We want to give you this
small present for your daughter.

01:19:24.846 --> 01:19:27.516
- P is for party
- A is for all right

01:19:27.616 --> 01:19:30.084
- R is for rowdy
- T is for tonight

01:19:30.485 --> 01:19:33.855
- Y is for you
- You know what to do

01:19:33.955 --> 01:19:37.516
I said, party, party

01:19:37.726 --> 01:19:40.058
Fumiko sent a poem.

01:19:40.895 --> 01:19:44.262
She wrote it for Lieutenant Crowe.
Her way of saying thank you.

01:19:46.968 --> 01:19:49.300
You're going to have to read that.

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:04.048
"Small boat beyond horizon

01:20:04.886 --> 01:20:06.547
"Big boat in harbor

01:20:07.255 --> 01:20:08.882
"Which course is true?"

01:20:10.825 --> 01:20:12.656
It's not easy to translate.

01:20:13.628 --> 01:20:14.686
What's it mean?

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:17.157
I think Fumiko thought you would know.

01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:22.326
I appreciate the thought.
Please, thank her for me.

01:20:23.038 --> 01:20:24.562
I wish she could have come.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.571
It's difficult for her.

01:20:27.942 --> 01:20:29.603
When we are back in Japan...

01:20:30.545 --> 01:20:33.882
she will stay with my mother
in the country for a while.

01:20:33.982 --> 01:20:37.281
Well then, thank you
very much for your hospitality.

01:20:54.769 --> 01:20:57.829
I wish we could have found
their daughter sooner.

01:22:42.544 --> 01:22:44.910
Wait, as I was saying...

01:22:45.613 --> 01:22:49.049
Yes, he's here. I'll tell him.

01:23:03.431 --> 01:23:05.763
- The little girl, Fumiko?
- Yeah?

01:23:06.634 --> 01:23:07.965
She's dead.

01:23:09.637 --> 01:23:10.865
Overdose.

01:23:14.142 --> 01:23:17.305
"Small boat beyond horizon,
big boat in harbor"

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.772
Sounds like a riddle to me.

01:23:21.449 --> 01:23:23.918
Fumiko told her mother
I would know what it meant.

01:23:24.018 --> 01:23:26.454
I don't think she would send me a riddle.

01:23:26.554 --> 01:23:27.987
It's a poem.

01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:31.826
You think she's trying
to tell me that the...

01:23:31.926 --> 01:23:34.656
"small boat beyond the horizon" is her...

01:23:34.829 --> 01:23:36.456
dead, out of it?

01:23:37.765 --> 01:23:40.131
And the "big boat in the harbor" is...

01:23:42.036 --> 01:23:44.630
a boat where Duke is hiding out.

01:23:46.908 --> 01:23:48.476
Remember that piece of paper?

01:23:48.576 --> 01:23:50.874
- Tampico, Long Beach?
- Yeah?

01:23:51.346 --> 01:23:53.337
We thought it may be a restaurant.

01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:57.442
Could be the name of the boat.

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:04.658
It's worth a call to the harbormaster.

01:25:37.785 --> 01:25:39.412
- Let's grab them.
- Not yet!

01:26:00.842 --> 01:26:02.503
They're going to get away.

01:26:03.778 --> 01:26:05.939
No, this is the only way out.

01:26:08.082 --> 01:26:10.141
- What now?
- Wait.

01:26:12.754 --> 01:26:13.914
Let's take them!

01:27:47.215 --> 01:27:49.206
Okay. Get going.

01:28:20.515 --> 01:28:23.416
Get him out. Move it! Get out.

01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:37.691
I'll get you, you little shit!

01:32:47.114 --> 01:32:49.344
I can't swim! Save me!

01:32:51.485 --> 01:32:53.783
Crowe, don't let me die!

01:32:54.388 --> 01:32:57.380
Oh, God! Save me!

01:32:58.092 --> 01:32:59.855
Please, save...

01:33:02.363 --> 01:33:03.921
I can't swim!

01:33:06.033 --> 01:33:07.694
Oh, God!

01:33:22.817 --> 01:33:24.785
You know, Duke, it was my intention...

01:33:25.186 --> 01:33:28.553
to leave you beside the road
somewhere in a gunnysack.

01:33:29.089 --> 01:33:32.093
But I felt that justice
would not have been served.

01:33:32.193 --> 01:33:34.058
Poetic justice, that is.

01:33:34.395 --> 01:33:37.125
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- You'll see.

01:33:38.666 --> 01:33:40.793
Hey, pretty boy!

01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:45.373
Look here! Hey, pussy!
Pussy. Young, tight thing!

01:33:45.473 --> 01:33:48.676
Hey, sweet thing!
I got something big and long for you!

01:33:48.776 --> 01:33:51.679
Hey, pretty boy, cut you!

01:33:51.779 --> 01:33:54.942
Hey, guys, I got me a new mama!

01:33:55.082 --> 01:33:57.051
And when I'm through with this bitch...

01:33:57.151 --> 01:34:00.985
she's gonna walk out of this cellblock
wearing a strapless and heels.

01:34:01.655 --> 01:34:02.655
Crowe!

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:05.484
You're a fucking bastard!

01:34:14.735 --> 01:34:16.168
Here's your dinner!

01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:18.966
Don't fuck with me, boy!

01:34:20.107 --> 01:34:22.974
- Don't touch me!
- Don't fuck with me, boy!

01:34:25.112 --> 01:34:28.377
Crowe! You bastard!

01:34:28.949 --> 01:34:30.382
That's justice.
