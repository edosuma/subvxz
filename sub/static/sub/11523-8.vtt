00:06.464 --> 00:09.134
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- Please.

00:09.217 --> 00:11.278
It's only Fake Christmas,
Ms. Schmidt-If-You're-Nasty.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.221
I think this is cute.

00:13.304 --> 00:17.517
And a little weird,
like a bunny with human teeth.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.352
But why is she here?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.146
I had to invite Mimi.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.189
She had no place to go on Fake Christmas.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.024
This is not a real holiday.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.068
She had nowhere to go on a Thursday.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.820
Well, I've got the Christmas spirit.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.406
I made everybody stockings,

00:31.489 --> 00:33.366
even Murasaki.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.869
Murasaki doesn't do Christmas.

00:35.952 --> 00:37.787
Ho, ho, ho!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.831
- Merry Christmas!
- Santa!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.042
Wait, I can't kiss you.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.210
I'm married!

00:44.294 --> 00:47.672
And Mrs. Claus is a beautiful
and very sexual woman.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.196
Where was all this acting commitment

00:49.257 --> 00:51.657
when I asked you to say it was my birthday
at Baskin Robbins?

00:53.428 --> 00:55.388
- The Jews took my painting!
- What?

00:55.472 --> 00:57.390
Now it's a party!

00:57.474 --> 00:59.476
Ho, ho, ho.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.769
You ho!

01:00.852 --> 01:02.062
Sonja?

01:04.438 --> 01:05.774
Where's Dong?

01:05.857 --> 01:07.192
How would I know?

01:07.275 --> 01:09.319
He says he's been working late,

01:09.402 --> 01:13.281
and then I found this under his pillow.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.659
- Is that my scrunchie?
- Hey!

01:16.743 --> 01:19.579
You don't barge into people's tugboats...

01:19.662 --> 01:23.833
uh, homes... and wave
a pocket butthole at them!

01:25.001 --> 01:26.544
I put it there, Sonja.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.881
I went to your house
to beg Dong to take me back.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.675
He kicked me out,
but I hid this under his pillow.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.153
I thought, that way,
I might be in his dreams,

01:34.177 --> 01:36.012
like Freddy Krueger, but romantic,

01:36.095 --> 01:37.138
but with the same sweater.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.599
This seems much less
important than my thing.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.519
I'm watching you, Kimmy,
and you never know where I am

01:42.602 --> 01:44.646
because of my invisibility hat.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.568
He kept my scrunchie.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.195

- Sorry, little boy.
- Ew, stop.

You're a worse actor than Cate Blanchett.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.779
Hmm.

Yeah, I get that a lot.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.855
What's eating you, sweetheart?

03:08.938 --> 03:11.441
Some Jewish family
is claiming that the Nazis

03:11.524 --> 03:13.985
stole my Mondrian from them in the '30s.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.862
They can't take my painting!

03:15.945 --> 03:18.072
- Well, maybe I can help.
- Really?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.490
- I can't pay you.
- Come on.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.327
I got your back with this painting thing.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.787
I actually know a little something
about that world.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.623
Twice a week, I'm a nude model

03:26.706 --> 03:29.751
for what I'm pretty sure is an art class.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.213
Kimmy, wh...

03:34.297 --> 03:38.509
Dong, I know Sonja's at work,
so I knew you'd be alone.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.346
Yes, Sonja is at work.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.604
Look, Sonja found my scrunchie
under your pillow,

03:49.687 --> 03:51.731
so I told her the truth:

03:51.814 --> 03:53.566
that I put it there because I'm trying

03:53.650 --> 03:55.652
to drive the two of you apart.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.904
Oh, how could you?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.948
- What a trick to play.
- I know.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.866
I was being a real slutburger.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.535
But since I'm here...

04:06.829 --> 04:09.374
Mm.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.000
Now it's your turn.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.877
Yeah, take it.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.504
You have to leave!

04:14.587 --> 04:15.672
I'm married!

04:15.755 --> 04:17.423
I cannot suck on your scarf!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.091
Fine, I give up.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.552
Now that I know how you
really feel about me...

04:22.637 --> 04:24.013
goodbye forever.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.016
I hate you so much,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.559
you crazy American witch.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.853
I hate you, too.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.988
Ah, Sonja.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.072
Where did you come from?

04:43.074 --> 04:45.994
This bus is taking forever!

04:48.204 --> 04:50.123
Ermahgerd.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.518
I took the day off for Kimmy,
and now she's out chasing Dong.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.626
You know what?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.086
I'm going out, Mimi Kanassis.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.754
I'm gonna find me an ice cream shop

04:56.838 --> 05:00.258
that won't ask for ID
when I tell them it's my birthday.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.430
Uh-uh, Rick.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.765
I am not coming in to work on my day off.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.600
Titus, we are slammed.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.769
Jason just got a callback for <i>Hamilton,</i>

05:11.853 --> 05:13.479
so we need you to cover his shift.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.481
Why didn't I get an audition for that?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.245
They're just prejudiced 'cause I can't rap

05:17.317 --> 05:18.335
or walk quickly in a circle.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.486
Titus, you know the day
the ground beef expires

05:20.570 --> 05:21.839
is our busiest time of the month.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.741
Just get down here, okay?

05:26.117 --> 05:28.828
When will this liberal war
on Fake Christmas end?

05:28.911 --> 05:30.973
So you're the creep who's trying
to take this painting

05:30.997 --> 05:32.248
out of my children's mouths.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.624
My name is Russ Snyder.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.169
I'm the attorney for the Jewish
Art Reclamation Project,

05:36.252 --> 05:37.253
or JARP!

05:37.336 --> 05:38.671
Please excuse the sling.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.674
I can't discuss it
due to an ongoing lawsuit,

05:41.758 --> 05:44.510
but... the door said "push."

05:44.594 --> 05:45.928
It did, okay?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.055
So every...

05:47.138 --> 05:48.532
All right,
let's get to the matter at hand.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.600
I'm not giving anything to those whiners!

05:50.683 --> 05:52.935
Ms. White, the family
pronounces it "Wiener."

05:53.019 --> 05:55.480
And their claim
to <i>Composition in Burgundy and Gold</i>

05:55.563 --> 05:57.315
is frankly unassailable.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.358
But it's her painting! She bought it!

05:59.442 --> 06:02.779
Yes, only after Hermann Goering stole it

06:02.862 --> 06:04.238
so he could turn it into a dress.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.991
Fortunately, the war ended
before he could create

06:07.075 --> 06:09.243
what would have been
a real statement piece for him.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.913
Now, take these.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.122
Excuse the greasy hands.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.292
I had an <i>empanada con queso</i> in the car.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.628
Now, you can clearly see the evidence here

06:18.711 --> 06:21.631
in this 1936 photo of the family home.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.301
Oh, yeah, they look real Jewish.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.720
What... No, they're standing
in front of the painting.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.180
Really?

06:29.263 --> 06:32.016
Because my painting has colors in it!

06:35.061 --> 06:37.021
- All right, Mr. Dubbin...
- "Mister"?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.106
I like him!

06:38.189 --> 06:40.441
Let me know how your office
would like to proceed.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.443
I'd like to bring some
well-deserved closure

06:42.527 --> 06:45.988
to Harry Wiener and his late wife,
Ivana Eda-Wiener.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.327
What do we do?

06:51.410 --> 06:53.704
Well, we could either
give the painting back,

06:53.788 --> 06:57.083
or I can stall this thing
pretty much forever.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.417
- You can?
- Oh, yeah.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.711
It's the one thing I'm better at
than my brother, David.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.463
You should see him peel an orange.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.714
Perfect!

07:03.798 --> 07:06.968
We just let those bastards
twist in the wind,

07:07.051 --> 07:09.387
like the twins on laundry day.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.557
Exactly, so you just keep me
on retainer indefinitely,

07:12.640 --> 07:14.267
and that painting stays with you.

07:14.350 --> 07:18.688
See, I've got this little
courtroom stalling trick.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.274
It's...

07:21.357 --> 07:22.900
pretty...

07:22.984 --> 07:25.319
amazing.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.405
What...

07:27.488 --> 07:29.157
I...

07:29.240 --> 07:31.701
do...

07:31.784 --> 07:33.828
is...

07:47.425 --> 07:49.886
Well, this is some Fake Christmas.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.387
Where did everybody go, anyway?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.723
Jacqueline took the old lady
to the movies,

07:53.806 --> 07:55.516
and the black guy's dead!

08:03.357 --> 08:04.734
Dong?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.988
How did you fit in Rat Alley?

08:09.071 --> 08:10.990
Why did you take the fall
for me with Sonja?

08:11.073 --> 08:14.202
After the way I treated you,
I was like Cher in <i>Clueless</i>

08:14.285 --> 08:16.287
pretending she wasn't falling for Josh.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.997
As if!

08:18.080 --> 08:20.625
You have every reason to hate me,

08:20.708 --> 08:22.752
but you protected me.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.462
You are such a good person, Kimmy.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.299
Every day, after Sonja
goes to work at the U.N...

08:28.382 --> 08:29.675
Wait, where?

08:29.759 --> 08:30.927
I smell your scrunchie

08:31.010 --> 08:33.221
and dream of when I am
divorced in two years.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.972
As if!

08:35.056 --> 08:36.265
I can't live like this.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.683
- Run away with me!
- What?

08:37.767 --> 08:38.601
No, I...

08:38.683 --> 08:40.102
You were right this whole time.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.812
We shouldn't wait to live our lives.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.096
But you could lose everything.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.358
Without you, I already have.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.990
Sonja knows you work nights,

08:53.074 --> 08:54.992
so take tonight off.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.494
We could go somewhere together.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.288
Like when Joey and Pacey
went to Aunt Gwen's cottage in

08:59.372 --> 09:01.172
"The Creek of the Son of Daw."

09:01.207 --> 09:02.416
But where would we go?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.627
I think we're both
thinking the same thing.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.045
On three.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.005
One, two, three.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.423
Four.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.925
The Poconos.

09:13.928 --> 09:14.845
What are you doing?

09:14.929 --> 09:17.723
You're not Frankenwolf today.
You're filling in for Jason.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.225
The Spooky Gravedigger?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.851
Wait, I'm shift manager?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.270
Do I still get to do my solo?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.897
No, the Invisible Kraken
will take your part.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.525
You have way too much work to do.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.526
Wert?

09:28.609 --> 09:30.570
But those papers
have numbers on them, Rick.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.654
Numbers!

09:31.737 --> 09:34.156
The most boring of all the shapes!

09:40.496 --> 09:41.914
Hey, are you the manager?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.000
I think these Spooky Joes went bad.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.001
Serve them anyway!

09:45.084 --> 09:46.460
Have the customers no toilets?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.796
Have they no trash cans?

09:52.174 --> 09:56.095
Wow, will you look at this place?

09:56.178 --> 09:57.263
Oh, my God.

09:57.346 --> 10:01.559
A Wall Street fella
could really kill a lady in here.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.563
It's all over.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.608
All you got to do is pay the lawyer

10:08.691 --> 10:11.068
to stall for you until the Wieners...

10:15.156 --> 10:17.241
I can't do that!

10:17.325 --> 10:20.077
I... I can't afford to do that.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.996
I'm broke, okay?

10:22.079 --> 10:23.205
Are you kidding?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.541
With this apartment and that wig?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.834
I can't stay here.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.502
That painting was all I had left.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.049
This is the painting?

10:33.132 --> 10:38.054
It's just a bunch of squares
and, like, three paints.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.222
A kid could draw this!

10:40.306 --> 10:42.600
Or we could.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.274
Well, we're getting closer.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.072
Wait, which one is the original?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.657
Oh, God.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.909
I'll have to sell my diamonds and pearls.

10:59.992 --> 11:03.746
Oh, honey, you're gonna have
to sell all your Prince albums.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.956
Well, at least then I can cancel
my insurance policy.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.833
I won't have anything worth insuring.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.418
Hang on.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.962
Is the painting insured?

11:12.046 --> 11:13.172
Well, of course.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.801
A standard policy against fire,
theft, orgy mist, and class war.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.803
Well, why didn't you say so?

11:18.886 --> 11:20.513
That's easy!

11:20.596 --> 11:24.266
All you got to do is say
you're giving the painting back

11:24.350 --> 11:27.937
to Harry Wiener and his daughter,
Anita Wiener-Statt.

11:28.020 --> 11:32.274
But then... Oh, no...
a bunch of dogs eat it!

11:32.358 --> 11:35.736
I know a guy who makes things happen.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.530
What kind of things?

11:37.613 --> 11:41.534
Well, let's just say
the New York Liberty did not beat

11:41.617 --> 11:43.786
the Indiana Fever last night

11:43.869 --> 11:47.331
on the strength of their crisp layups.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.874
Here's the number.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.877
I don't know if I can do that.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.048
Think it over.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.064
I've never stayed at a hotel before,

12:12.148 --> 12:15.609
but I don't think this place is open.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.237
When I called from the road,
the fax line was working.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.905
Nope, it was that raccoon.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.620
Let's find someplace else to stay.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.497
I promised you Aunt Gwen's cottage, and...

12:28.581 --> 12:29.748
This is better.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.542
We can have whatever room we want,

12:31.625 --> 12:34.628
and there's no way
anyone's gonna spot us here.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.964
And look, they must have tennis!

12:37.798 --> 12:40.050
Oh, man, no, I think
this used to be an orange.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.062
I bet this place
used to be really romantic.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.314
Seriously.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.649
I mean, the bathtub's shaped like a butt!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.950
"Warning regarding babies and hot tubs:

13:05.034 --> 13:07.077
Due to the high temperatures
and their ability

13:07.161 --> 13:09.830
to preserve prostatic fluid,
bathe at your own risk

13:09.914 --> 13:11.832
of spontaneous pregnancy."

13:13.334 --> 13:17.213
Wow, that's not where
I thought that was headed.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.674
So we can do whatever we want.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.762
I feel like Kevin McCallister
in <i>Home Alone.</i>

13:24.845 --> 13:26.472
And I'm the old man with the shovel.

13:27.723 --> 13:31.519
Okay, on three, let's both say
what we want to do.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.897
One, two, three.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.666
- Raid the candy machine!
- Lose my American virginity.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.900
Candy machine.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.743
Whoo-hoo!

13:47.826 --> 13:48.744
Oh, yeah!

13:48.827 --> 13:50.996
Whoo!
Whoo!

13:59.129 --> 14:01.048
Please, ma'am,
I'm trying to be reasonable.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.633
Heater's broken on six!

14:02.716 --> 14:04.653
You'll have to take that up
with your credit card company,

14:04.677 --> 14:07.012
but I can offer you
a complimentary waffle.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.013
Mount Breezy Lodge.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
Please hold forever.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.378
So what should we do now?

14:39.461 --> 14:41.797
I mean, what else do people
even do in hotels...

14:41.881 --> 14:43.799
with beds...

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
together?

14:46.093 --> 14:47.177
We don't have to.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.680
No, I want to.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.100
Why do you think I packed
this fancy nightgown?

14:59.523 --> 15:00.858
Let's brush our teeth!

15:06.947 --> 15:08.324
Take a load off.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.259
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

15:27.343 --> 15:28.469
I don't know why I did that!

15:28.552 --> 15:30.304
Did I do something wrong?

15:30.387 --> 15:32.514
No, I just have problems.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.767
I had a weird childhood.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.186
Like Anna Chlumsky in <i>My Girl.</i>

15:39.563 --> 15:41.690
Let's try again. Please.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.692
Okay.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.944
I'm going to kiss you now.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.320
Okay.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.744
Ugh, why does this keep happening?

15:57.998 --> 16:00.918
Damn Creepy Coins.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.129
Why can't we use gift cards
like everybody else?

16:04.213 --> 16:07.591
Hey, Titus, since you're the manager now,

16:07.675 --> 16:09.426
do you mind if I take off a little early?

16:09.510 --> 16:10.427
I do mind.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.113
You're being paid to be here, are you not?

16:12.137 --> 16:14.074
Or perhaps you'd rather
I replace you with a Yuko.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.183
But I have to take Tiny Tim to the doctor.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.601
I don't care about...

16:17.685 --> 16:19.103
Wait a minute, you don't have kids.

16:19.186 --> 16:22.856
Tiny Tim is my nickname for my penis.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.400
- He's very sick.
- Hogwash!

16:24.483 --> 16:26.026
The hogwash just made it worse!

16:26.110 --> 16:27.027
Fake Christmas or no,

16:27.111 --> 16:28.711
you shall work befitting your situation!

16:28.737 --> 16:30.823
If I gave everyone who had
a sick penis the day off,

16:30.906 --> 16:33.117
there'd be no one here at all,
least of all me, sir!

16:33.200 --> 16:34.368
Now, good day!

16:38.455 --> 16:40.416
I've got to do it for my family.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.625
I'm calling Lillian's guy.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.631
I've got no choice.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.632
I fail.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.259
<i>Calling voice mail.</i>

16:50.342 --> 16:51.552
No, idiot, I'm calling...

16:51.635 --> 16:53.178
<i>Yesterday, 9:10 p.m.</i>

16:53.262 --> 16:54.638
<i>It's her voice mail, Virgil.</i>

16:54.722 --> 16:57.099
<i>Hi, Jackie-Lynn, it's Mom.</i>

16:58.684 --> 17:00.227
I was in the paper!

17:00.310 --> 17:03.105
I found a leaf
that looked like January Jones.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.815
<i>She's from South Dakota, you know.</i>

17:04.897 --> 17:06.817
She knows!

17:06.900 --> 17:09.403
Oh, we forgot to tell you.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.614
That secret society at Yale finally agreed

17:12.698 --> 17:15.659
to return your
great-great-grandfather's skull.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.244
It's a beer stein now,

17:18.328 --> 17:21.165
<i>but the important thing is,
is that he's home.</i>

17:21.248 --> 17:24.084
<i>See, people do the right thing eventually.</i>

17:25.252 --> 17:27.087
I cut that leaf to look like her.

17:28.964 --> 17:31.258
<i>Call us when you can, dear.</i>

17:40.142 --> 17:41.810
Maybe this is still <i>Home Alone.</i>

17:41.894 --> 17:44.688
It's just the part where Kevin
cripples those desperate men.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.690
I don't want it to be <i>Home Alone.</i>

17:46.774 --> 17:49.485
That's not... sexy.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.320
What happened to...

17:51.403 --> 17:52.780
<i>Dawson's Creek!</i>

17:55.491 --> 17:57.034
Yeah, I get that a lot.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.828
But like the name tag says, I'm Purvis.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.582
That's what I wanted tonight to be like.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.917
Remember the end of season one

18:05.000 --> 18:06.543
when Dawson and Joey finally kissed?

18:06.627 --> 18:07.961
It was so perfect!

18:08.045 --> 18:10.422
Ha! Perfect.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.132
She doesn't even end up with Dawson.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.259
What? But it's his creek.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.262
Yeah, Joey and Pacey go all the way

18:17.346 --> 18:19.640
on the class ski trip
at the end of season four.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.058
Well, I only saw season one

18:21.141 --> 18:22.893
for totally normal not weird reasons.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.938
And it's not like their thing
was all that perfect either.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.741
I mean, Pacey and Joey
were totally fighting

18:27.773 --> 18:28.690
for that entire ski trip

18:28.774 --> 18:30.294
because of that blonde in the hot tub.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.961
And what about that speech that she gave?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.320
What was up with that?

18:33.403 --> 18:35.215
"This is because you carried
my bag off the bus.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.800
This is because
you taught me how to drive."

18:36.824 --> 18:37.991
I mean, she makes sex

18:38.075 --> 18:41.829
sound like some sort of...
McDonaldland gift card

18:41.912 --> 18:43.552
you'd give your dog walker for Christmas.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.933
I mean, how about, "This is because

18:44.957 --> 18:46.792
I find you really attractive, Pacey.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.853
This is because I love
your doughy little boy body,

18:48.877 --> 18:50.557
and I know it's gonna tighten up one day."

18:50.587 --> 18:53.340
Whatever.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.342
He got through it.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.554
Jeez, Purvis, I had no idea
it was so complicated.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.764
Yeah, and don't even
get me started on sex.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.516
I mean, it's weird, and it's gross,

19:02.599 --> 19:04.410
and it's way too close
to where we poop and pee,

19:04.434 --> 19:05.894
which is why I'm never gonna do it.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.482
Well, I guess we all have our issues.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.693
But as long as you find the right person,

19:12.776 --> 19:14.611
you know, like Pacey and Joey,

19:14.695 --> 19:16.495
none of the rest of that stuff
really matters.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.325
Just the ice pack, then?

19:20.409 --> 19:22.953
Um...

19:23.036 --> 19:25.038
condoms?!

19:28.417 --> 19:29.543
Good news!

19:29.626 --> 19:33.130
Jason got the part in <i>Hamilton</i>
of break-dancing John Locke,

19:33.213 --> 19:35.424
so consider yourself promoted!

19:35.507 --> 19:37.134
You mean I have to do this job forever?

19:37.217 --> 19:39.970
Yes, we are gonna have
to recast your old part.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.555
Uh...

19:41.638 --> 19:45.267
Rodney could fit
into the Frankenwolf costume.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.894
I get to sing?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.520
Goodbye, Rodney Simmons.

19:48.604 --> 19:52.566
Hello, Troylus Cressibo, star on the rise!

19:55.152 --> 19:57.487
It's like looking into my own past,

19:57.571 --> 19:59.489
right down to the six-pack abs.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.824
Shut up.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.409
I used to be like him.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.411
Now I'm just sitting here
counting my money.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.496
What will become of me if I keep this up?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.377
Oh, God!

20:12.461 --> 20:14.022
That's what the president looks like now?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.256
Spirit, are you saying
that's what I'll turn into

20:16.340 --> 20:17.382
if I'm the boss?

20:17.466 --> 20:20.677
All gray and wrinkly
and everyone hates me?

20:20.761 --> 20:23.972
Nah, man, I just want to know
if I can switch to hockey.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.183
Is that really what it's all about?

20:26.266 --> 20:28.268
What's the point of any of it?

20:29.728 --> 20:30.729
Lillian.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.732
Kimmy.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.359
My loyal servants.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.987
You know what?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.239
I quit!

20:40.322 --> 20:42.002
I'm going home to celebrate Fake Christmas

20:42.074 --> 20:43.367
with the people I fake love!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.502
If I'm reading this right,

20:53.585 --> 20:55.921
one of us needs to go back for a banana.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.549
Let me see if I can figure it out.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.475
I blame my mom for this.

21:08.558 --> 21:11.061
She never taught me
about the birds and the bees.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.562
And the Durnsville school system

21:12.646 --> 21:14.606
only taught us
about the birds and the bees.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.194
Did you know God won't let penguins fly

21:19.278 --> 21:20.696
because they're gay?

21:27.202 --> 21:29.288
Ready for the hurricane?

21:29.371 --> 21:32.457
Uh, Kimmy?

21:32.541 --> 21:34.334
Oh, no!

21:34.418 --> 21:35.978
Have I been punching you
this whole time

21:36.003 --> 21:37.087
and didn't realize it?

21:37.170 --> 21:39.131
I think I have a latex allergy.

21:39.214 --> 21:42.134
This happened once before
when I tried to sleep

21:42.217 --> 21:44.386
on a pile of cut-up bike tires.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.555
Call back.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.140
And now I can't breathe,

21:48.223 --> 21:51.351
which means my brain isn't getting

21:51.435 --> 21:53.645
any of your emails, Peter.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.150
No!

21:58.233 --> 21:59.568
Not <i>My Girl.</i>

21:59.651 --> 22:01.820
It's supposed to be <i>Dawson's Creek.</i>

22:06.241 --> 22:07.576
Hello, 911, this is Kimmy.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.161
How are you?

22:09.244 --> 22:10.404
I'm just trying to be polite.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.747
I've never done this before.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.665
And you're wasting my time!

22:23.216 --> 22:25.302
Will you stop making those noises?

22:25.385 --> 22:26.404
Okay, look, I'll have you know

22:26.428 --> 22:27.947
that some of the most powerful men
in history

22:27.971 --> 22:28.972
were mouth-breathers.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.975
Lou Ferrigno, Henry Kissinger,

22:32.059 --> 22:35.520
John Merrick, whom you may know better
as the Elephant Man.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.773
Wow, and you're boring.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.608
You're the total package!

22:39.691 --> 22:40.984
Are we done here?

22:41.068 --> 22:43.487
I think I just figured out
why a beautiful woman like you

22:43.570 --> 22:46.531
is living alone,
but I'm afraid I can't leave

22:46.615 --> 22:48.492
until the Mondrian does.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.369
Look, I'm not the bad guy here, okay?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.370
Really?

22:52.454 --> 22:53.622
Well, then who is?

22:53.705 --> 22:56.208
Who do I blame for all of this?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.542
Kimmy.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.669
Kimmy did this to me.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.255
She said I didn't need
a rich husband to support me,

23:02.339 --> 23:03.757
but she was wrong.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.760
I just want my old life back.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.154
All right, just take the painting

23:08.178 --> 23:09.596
directly to the granddaughter,

23:09.679 --> 23:12.432
Maya Wiener-Hertz-Allott-Cozzabudts.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.683
All right, let's go.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.978
I got to wheels up back to D.C.
in 90 minutes.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.772
He has a jet?

23:18.855 --> 23:22.067
I haven't flown private in so long.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.784
Yeah, okay, good.

23:30.867 --> 23:31.868
That's it.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.387
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.287
What?

23:34.371 --> 23:36.289
And I'm guessing this isn't
Mrs. Green Card

23:36.373 --> 23:38.875
you were trespassing with
on a federal raccoon sanctuary?

23:45.549 --> 23:47.968
This is the kind of stuff
Trump's talking about.

23:48.051 --> 23:48.969
Yeah, you're telling me, Dave.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.471
These Chinese guys
taking all our redheads.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.056
I'll call Immigration.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.978
I'm so sorry, Dong.

23:58.061 --> 23:58.979
I ruined your life,

23:59.062 --> 24:00.939
and we didn't even super make out.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.150
You didn't ruin my life.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.153
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

24:09.322 --> 24:12.659
You know, there's no
old telephones in here.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.078
- Uh-huh.
- And you're in handcuffs...

24:15.162 --> 24:17.914
which is making my brain feel calm

24:17.998 --> 24:19.833
for more totally normal reasons.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.501
Kimmy, are you sure?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.378
We're never going to see each other again,

24:23.461 --> 24:25.797
and it's really gross back here.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.717
It's never gonna be perfect.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.612
Oh!

24:48.695 --> 24:50.697
Thank... Thank God you're home!

24:50.780 --> 24:52.699
I just chased some guy out of here

24:52.782 --> 24:55.535
after I caught him wrecking your toilet!

24:55.619 --> 24:57.537
Dong got arrested.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.331
They're gonna send him back to Vietnam.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.504
I got a guy who has some dogs,

25:06.588 --> 25:08.965
but I don't think
his dogs are gonna be able

25:09.049 --> 25:11.218
to eat your way out of this one.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.973
Boy, what day is today?

25:17.057 --> 25:18.183
Me?

25:18.266 --> 25:19.392
Um, Thursday.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.228
Oh, it hardly seems possible.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.896
So much has happened!

25:22.979 --> 25:24.231
I ran all the way home

25:24.314 --> 25:27.067
because it seemed
more festive and dramatic,

25:27.150 --> 25:31.029
but it took, like, four hours,
and it was definitely a mistake!

25:31.112 --> 25:34.532
But I finally learned the true meaning
of Fake Christmas!

25:34.616 --> 25:36.743
Since when do you care
about Fake Christmas?

25:36.826 --> 25:38.328
Anyway, it's almost over.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.497
Oh, Kimmy, don't you get it?

25:42.123 --> 25:44.626
Fake Christmas
isn't about a day of the year,

25:44.709 --> 25:46.795
and it's definitely not
about getting presents!

25:48.088 --> 25:49.005
Titus!

25:49.089 --> 25:51.383
What in the hello, Operator,
please give me number nine?

25:54.177 --> 25:59.099
Fake Christmas is about one simple thing.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.309
It's about being with your fake family.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.064
My baby servants.

26:13.154 --> 26:17.200

28:22.742 --> 28:24.661
<i>- Good night, everybody!
