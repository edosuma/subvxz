00:00.960 --> 00:02.810
Previously on Enterprise:

00:02.900 --> 00:04.260
Captain, I've located Ensign Sato.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.580
She's aboard one of the Reptilian vessels.

00:07.689 --> 00:09.140
The third launch code...

00:09.510 --> 00:11.360
We have complete access.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.490
The Guardians will not let us fail.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.870
The power ratings from the weapon are increasing.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.320
They're preparing to launch.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.440
Open a vortex.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.870
Set a course for Earth.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.070
The Captain wants to take
a team aboard to destroy it.

00:33.180 --> 00:34.640
I need three volunteers.

00:34.810 --> 00:36.550
She's undergone a severe neural trauma.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.950
She's been inside the weapon.
I have to know what she saw.

00:38.950 --> 00:41.220
Have her taken aboard Degra's ship right away.

00:42.740 --> 00:47.280
The Aquatics joined us only because you promised
to neutralize the spheres.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.020
We have a plan to disable Sphere 41.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.690
If we're right, it should disrupt the entire network.

00:52.710 --> 00:55.760
Reptilians will preside over a stronger, ...

00:55.760 --> 00:58.190
unified Xindi Empire, ...

00:58.390 --> 01:01.190
if humankind is eradicated.

01:08.350 --> 01:12.590
If they'd made us the dominant species
before the wars, ...

01:13.360 --> 01:15.430
our homeworld would still exist.

01:15.690 --> 01:18.800
And our alien brothers would still fill the skies.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.450
We should be grateful ...

01:20.720 --> 01:24.330
that the Guardians have finally come to their senses.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.500
Once Earth is destroyed, the Reptilians...

01:27.970 --> 01:31.080
will take their rightful place at the head ...

01:31.080 --> 01:34.000
of a new Xindi Empire.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

03:03.480 --> 03:06.880
They're nearly three hours ahead of us,
but this vessel is faster.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.340
We're closing the gap.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.420
It may be faster, but it's not well-armed.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.270
How many ships are escorting the weapon?

03:12.270 --> 03:13.950
I can't tell.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.420
The only way we're going to be able
to destroy this thing is from the inside.

03:22.860 --> 03:23.720
Any luck?

03:25.260 --> 03:27.690
All of Degra's schematics are encrypted.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.320
We're going to need Hoshi to help us.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.920
She's in no condition to come up here.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.250
I wish I had a choice, Malcolm.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.260
Sir, she's barely conscious.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.850
Can you transfer that to a PADD...

03:41.250 --> 03:42.760
something portable?

03:45.590 --> 03:48.520
The favorable timelines continue to diminish.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.800
They should be increasing.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.240
The weapon has almost reached its target.

03:54.620 --> 03:57.620
But the Earth ship is on course
for a primary sphere.

03:58.050 --> 04:00.770
Accelerate the transformation around that sphere.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.680
They mustn't be allowed to intervene.

04:07.640 --> 04:08.590
Report.

04:08.590 --> 04:10.440
We've realigned the main power grid.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.550
It should increase the deflector pulse
threefold, maybe four.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.640
But it's gonna fry just about every system on board.

04:18.089 --> 04:20.649
Be prepared to initiate the pulse within two hours.

04:20.940 --> 04:22.830
I don't think you heard what I just said.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.540
We try this and the ship's going
to come apart at the seams.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.460
Two hours, Mr. Tucker!

04:31.190 --> 04:34.650
The Captain told the Xindi
we'd try to knock these things out.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.220
He didn't say anything about demolishing
Enterprise in the process.

04:37.220 --> 04:40.460
Has it occurred to you what's going
to happen if Captain Archer fails?

04:40.460 --> 04:42.630
-If Earth is destroyed?
-Every day!

04:42.630 --> 04:43.930
Good.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.760
Then you've already come to
the conclusion that without humanity..

04:47.230 --> 04:50.030
there's no one to combat these sphere-builders.

04:50.030 --> 04:52.120
Their Expanse will continue to grow...

04:52.120 --> 04:56.540
encompassing one system after another,
including Vulcan.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.020
Your world is no longer the only one in jeopardy.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.840
Two hours.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.170
( door opening ) I think we've got a problem.

05:13.170 --> 05:14.230
What is it?

05:14.230 --> 05:15.750
Sphere 41...

05:16.720 --> 05:19.180
-Are you certain these are the coordinates?
-Yep.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.100
There shouldn't be anything on sensors,
not with the cloaking barrier, ...

05:23.220 --> 05:24.300
but therit is...

05:24.430 --> 05:25.510
and it's getting bigger.

05:25.510 --> 05:26.950
Have you analyzed it?

05:27.620 --> 05:29.080
Could be spatial anomalies...

05:29.080 --> 05:31.770
but they're clustered much tighter
than we've ever seen.

05:34.370 --> 05:36.930
They're transforming the space surrounding that sphere.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.930
Not unlike the disturbance
where we found the trans-dimensional being.

05:39.930 --> 05:41.560
They're obviously expecting us.

05:41.660 --> 05:42.960
If we're going to disable the network ...

05:42.960 --> 05:45.480
we'll need to get within a kilometer of the surface.

05:45.540 --> 05:49.440
If the ship were to enter that disturbance,
the entire crew would be dead within minutes.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.180
I could synthesize a neuroleptic compound ...

05:53.770 --> 05:56.540
that would keep us conscious
for approximately 12 minutes.

05:57.010 --> 05:59.960
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do
to prevent epidermal decay.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.890
12 minutes won't be enough.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.890
Perhaps I can extend it, but not by much.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.980
I encourage you and Mr. Tucker
to consider alternatives.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.320
There must be something you can do
to abbreviate your plan.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.070
Any luck?

06:21.210 --> 06:22.070
Ensign?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.390
I'm not feeling very well.

06:29.670 --> 06:32.900
Do you think you can get
Phlox to come down here?

06:34.350 --> 06:36.770
We're on Degra's ship, Hoshi.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.000
Phlox isn't here.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.680
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.800
The schematics for the weapon...

06:46.430 --> 06:48.510
Degra encrypted them before he was killed.

06:48.510 --> 06:50.450
You've been trying to decipher them.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.680
I can't remember the third code.

06:53.770 --> 06:55.830
They wouldn't have been able to arm the weapon if...

06:55.830 --> 06:57.710
I hadn't given th the third code.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.430
You were drugged, Hoshi.
You had no choice.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.120
I did-- I should have fought harder.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.580
You need to finish...

07:07.830 --> 07:09.530
what you're doing.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.210
You're almost there.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.040
We're going to board the weapon.

07:16.280 --> 07:18.290
Try to overload the power systems.

07:18.670 --> 07:21.840
But we can't do that until
we can read these schematics.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.550
I tried to jump, but I wasn't fast enough.

07:23.550 --> 07:24.950
You need to finish this.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.560
You got the three codes.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.110
So, why don't you just kill me?
Didn't you say you were going to kill me?

07:30.110 --> 07:32.000
You got to pull yourself together...

07:32.480 --> 07:34.470
just for a little while longer.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.160
You need to complete the decryption.

07:46.430 --> 07:47.920
Everything hinges on it.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.920
Do you understand?

07:53.740 --> 07:54.950
I understand.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.790
When we exit the vortex, how close will we be?

08:04.790 --> 08:06.730
Approximately two million kilometers from Earth.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.340
Two million?

08:08.340 --> 08:11.540
If we had all five codes,
we could begin the launch sequence immediately.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.090
But with three, we need additional time.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.440
We'd be vulnerable...

08:15.440 --> 08:18.190
if we dropped into normal space
any closer to the target.

08:18.190 --> 08:22.820
Do whatever it takes to fire
the weapon as quickly as possible.

08:29.410 --> 08:30.660
You wanted to see me, sir?

08:30.750 --> 08:34.520
I think I found a way to boost the deflector pulse
without tearing the ship apart,...

08:34.700 --> 08:37.929
but it's going to mean transferring
all impulse power to the array.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.220
When?

08:39.220 --> 08:40.860
Soon as we reach the sphere.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.809
Sir...

08:41.809 --> 08:43.100
Sorry, Travis.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.580
You're gonna have to get us
to the manifold on thrusters only.

08:45.970 --> 08:47.450
That's tying my hands, Commder.

08:47.470 --> 08:49.390
Especially with the ticking clock.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.660
You can do it.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.200
Look over these schematics.

08:53.330 --> 08:56.340
Familiarize yourself with the surface features of the sphere.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.300
We won't be able to transport directly
onto the control platform.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.760
It's too heavily shielded.

09:02.430 --> 09:03.990
We'll have to beam in and out.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.120
No deeper than this peripheral platform.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.020
What if you need to board the weapon before ....

09:08.020 --> 09:10.580
your crewman completes her decryption?

09:13.460 --> 09:14.660
I'm taking her with me.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.900
Sir, she's hardly in any shape...

09:16.900 --> 09:18.390
She's been there, Malcolm.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.070
That's where she deciphered
that third launch code.

09:21.070 --> 09:22.380
She was drugged.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.780
There's no reason to believe that she'll remember...

09:24.330 --> 09:25.890
She's coming with me!

09:27.040 --> 09:29.470
I want you and your team right before we do...

09:30.310 --> 09:32.260
secure the closest route to the platform.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.230
If you succeed in creating the overload, ...

09:36.520 --> 09:38.980
what makes you think
you'll be able to get out in time?

09:38.980 --> 09:41.570
I'll give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.400
You'll be in charge of helping Hoshi.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.470
And you, sir..?

09:48.260 --> 09:50.500
I have no plans of dying on that weapon, Malcolm.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.350
I'm going to see what else
she's come up with.

10:02.020 --> 10:04.170
This is a very important day, Jonathan.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.760
I don't have time for this.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.270
It'll only take a minute.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.160
You see the fellow in the blue jacket...

10:09.160 --> 10:10.770
near the left end of the dais?

10:11.280 --> 10:12.210
That's you...

10:12.210 --> 10:14.270
a little more than seven years from now.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.500
You and the others are about to make history.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.740
Do you remember I told you about a Federation?

10:26.930 --> 10:27.820
What about it?

10:28.790 --> 10:32.030
I work with some people who are going
to be pretty angry at me for telling you this, ...

10:32.030 --> 10:33.890
but you're going to be an integral part ...

10:33.890 --> 10:35.690
of forming that Federation.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.310
You're down there, right now,...

10:38.370 --> 10:40.550
with Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites ....

10:40.590 --> 10:42.520
getting ready to sign the Charter.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.270
The membership's going to grow.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.930
Dozens, eventually hundreds of species.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.480
A United Federation of Planets.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.710
I have a team preparing to board the weapon.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.960
I've got other things to think about right now.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.620
Let Reed or one of the others
go to the control platform.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.660
What are you talking about? ...

10:57.660 --> 11:00.910
It's too great a risk-- if you're killed,
none of this will happen, ....

11:01.210 --> 11:02.680
at least not the way it's supposed to happen.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.630
Then it'll happen some other way.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.700
Who's to say whether it'll be better or worse?

11:07.820 --> 11:10.080
It's essential you be a part of this.

11:11.610 --> 11:12.720
Where are we?

11:12.880 --> 11:13.920
What planet?

11:14.930 --> 11:15.500
Earth.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.150
Seems to me it's just as essential
that Earth be around for this, too.

11:19.150 --> 11:21.320
Lieutenant Reed can work with Sato.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.930
They are not crucial to the future of mankind.

11:25.470 --> 11:26.510
You are.

11:28.130 --> 11:32.070
My mission is to save Earth,
not your Federation.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.070
You can't ignore your place in history.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.710
My place is on that control platform.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.910
Now, get me the hell back to Degra's ship.

11:45.660 --> 11:48.270
And if it's not too much of an inconvenience,...

11:48.270 --> 11:52.380
I'd appreciate it if you'd contact
my first wife's third husband.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.010
Groznick.

11:56.770 --> 11:59.880
tell him that he's welcome
to keep the Aldebaran drum set I loaned him.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.700
Oh, they have...

12:02.230 --> 12:04.120
a child named Indaura.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.160
A sweet little girl-- she must be, uh...

12:07.630 --> 12:09.370
oh, eight or nine by now.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.940
Well, I would like to leave her my botanical library.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.140
She always had a flair for plants.

12:17.140 --> 12:18.770
Computer, pause recording.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.900
Everything's ready here.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.850
Commander Tucker has completed
his modifications to the deflector.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.470
I apologize if I interrupted you.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.630
Oh, no, no, don't be silly.

12:33.190 --> 12:36.620
I was simply dictating a letter
to my colleague, Dr. Lucas

12:37.150 --> 12:40.690
He offered to make sure my affairs were
in order in the event that, uh...

12:41.950 --> 12:43.030
Well, you know.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.740
I've always found it distracting to think of death, ...

12:47.740 --> 12:50.190
especially when entering a dangerous situation.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.010
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.280
I don't know about Vulcans, but Denobulans...

12:55.280 --> 12:59.120
take great pleasure in bequeathing
their belongings to far-flung relatives.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.570
We're not dead yet.

13:01.070 --> 13:02.350
Bridge to T'Pol.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.300
Go ahead.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.010
We're approaching the coordinates.

13:09.010 --> 13:10.340
Take us out of warp.

13:13.330 --> 13:14.980
Hope for the best, Doctor.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.310
It's grown.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.550
It's 100,000 kilometers deeper than
when we first detected it.

13:35.550 --> 13:38.100
I've enhanced the neuroleptic compound
as much as I can.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.620
I strongly advise we remain in the disturbance
no longer than 15 minutes.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.100
Are you ready to release the compound?

13:46.850 --> 13:48.100
Then proceed.

13:48.220 --> 13:50.120
Stand by to charge the deflector.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.220
Set a course, Ensign.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.880
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

13:57.030 --> 13:59.800
We've begun to formulate a plan, thanks to Hoshi, ...

13:59.800 --> 14:02.800
who's made some progress
in decrypting the schematics.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.210
What have you guys figured out?

14:05.720 --> 14:10.180
We've got to disable the reactor at
a specific point during the inversion sequence,

14:10.740 --> 14:12.110
but we don't know the sequence.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.110
If it's not done in the right order,...

14:15.300 --> 14:19.150
the internal safeguards will kick in,
and it'll be impossible to create an overload.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.670
I found the sequence,
but decrypting it's another story.

14:22.670 --> 14:24.880
Your friend Degra didn't make this easy.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.880
I wish I could tell you to take your time.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.540
First time you came to visit me in Brazil...

14:32.540 --> 14:34.190
It didn't stop raining for a week.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.180
I had a bug then, too.

14:36.430 --> 14:40.370
A tropical bacteria, not a reptilian parasite.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.400
I was sick as dog,...

14:44.910 --> 14:47.410
but I wanted to make a good impression.

14:47.530 --> 14:49.070
When we get back home,

14:49.570 --> 14:53.670
I'll see to it you get some R
R
in Norway or Canada.

14:54.710 --> 14:57.270
Someplace where there's not
a tropical bug in sight.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.490
Or reptiles.

14:58.490 --> 14:59.410
Or reptiles.

15:00.340 --> 15:01.440
Keep at it.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.100
I'll get these to the bridge.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.160
We've gotten close enough
to isolate their signatures.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.160
The Insectoid ship is no longer with them.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.880
Why would they leave the vortex?

15:17.880 --> 15:19.230
We have no idea.

15:19.480 --> 15:23.390
All we know is that the weapon is being
escorted by a single reptilian vessel...

15:23.880 --> 15:24.880
Dolim's.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.740
At least we only have one ship to contend with.

15:37.450 --> 15:38.910
Here we go.

15:40.380 --> 15:42.640
-Doctor?
- 15 minutes and counting.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.840
Any sign of the sphere?

15:48.300 --> 15:49.500
It's too soon.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.500
Hold your course.

15:55.860 --> 15:58.480
Degra's vessel is less than 20 minutes behind us.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.300
Lieutenant,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.430
we're about to drop into normal space.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.760
Stand by to initiate the firing sequence.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.730
We're ready.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.890
Are you detecting any Earth vessels
near the coordinates?

16:09.890 --> 16:10.920
No vessels.

16:11.010 --> 16:13.250
But there is one small orbital station.

16:16.390 --> 16:17.770
Unarmed.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.790
Let me see Earth.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.230
Enlarge.

16:38.170 --> 16:39.920
It's a shame,...

16:40.140 --> 16:41.570
all that water.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.810
The Aquatics would feel at home here.

16:47.910 --> 16:49.330
Have got it.

16:49.590 --> 16:51.830
-How far?
- 20,000 kilometers.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.110
13 minutes left.

16:53.230 --> 16:55.680
As soon as we make visual contact,
go to thrusters.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.670
Set a heading to latitude 15 degrees north.

16:59.100 --> 16:59.990
Deflector.

16:59.990 --> 17:01.210
Standing by.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.599
They're 800,000 kilometers ahead.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.990
Get your team ready to go.

17:17.990 --> 17:19.190
Aye, sir.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.630
Dolim's changing course.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.349
They're heading for a space station.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.630
Are we in visual range?

17:30.740 --> 17:32.260
Yosemite Three.

17:32.460 --> 17:33.960
A military instillation?

17:33.960 --> 17:35.740
A research post.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.570
Usually 30 to 40 civilians aboard.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.760
Hail them on this frequency.

17:47.090 --> 17:49.600
The weapon's emitting destruction waves.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.840
I can't get anything through.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.110
15 degrees north.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.130
Dock to 2,000 meters.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.870
Track starboard.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.850
82 mark zero.

18:04.850 --> 18:05.770
Aye.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.360
Doc, there's something weird happening to my skin.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.310
Me, too.

18:10.310 --> 18:12.050
It was expected-- try not to scratch it.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.080
11 minutes remaining.

18:17.110 --> 18:20.090
The Guardians said that once Earth is gone ...

18:20.090 --> 18:23.310
we're to destroy all human colonies.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.940
I see no reason not to begin with this station.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.080
Target.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.300
Fire when ready.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.000
They're heading back toward the weapon.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.700
Ten deees port.

18:58.310 --> 18:59.670
Slow to 30 KPH.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.810
I'm transferring the target point
to the deflector ray.

19:05.580 --> 19:06.390
Got it.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.010
Begin.

19:14.430 --> 19:15.810
Fish in a barrel.

19:18.710 --> 19:20.330
Less than ten minutes to go.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.710
What the hell's going on?!

19:59.710 --> 20:01.350
Power just fell ten percent!

20:01.350 --> 20:03.570
I'm picking up explosions on E-deck.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.850
Bridge to Engineering, report.

20:07.710 --> 20:08.850
I'm losing the beam!

20:08.920 --> 20:10.970
There are nine alien life signs aboard.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.900
They appear to be trans-dimensional beings.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.100
How's that possible?

20:14.100 --> 20:17.650
This disturbance we're in, it's obviously been altered
enough to sustain them.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.990
Who's on Degra's ship?

20:20.750 --> 20:25.570
Eight primates, three arboreals,
and seven humans.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.460
Have their weapons been upgraded?

20:28.460 --> 20:29.230
No, sir.

20:29.870 --> 20:31.320
Pathetic.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.240
Prepare to intercept.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.540
They're arming their torpedoes.

20:38.510 --> 20:39.360
Sir.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.520
How's Hoshi doing?

20:42.520 --> 20:43.800
She's holding up.

20:43.940 --> 20:46.490
She and the MACOs are at the transporter device.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.350
Remember, no heroics.

20:51.890 --> 20:54.920
Just get us in, and then keep them off your ass.

20:56.770 --> 20:59.320
There's another vessel approaching
at high warp.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.800
They're asking for you.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.650
You're not using your head, pink skin.

21:06.650 --> 21:09.410
That ship you're on is
no match for the Reptilian.

21:09.410 --> 21:11.740
I'm busy, Shran.
What are you doing here?

21:11.760 --> 21:15.140
You should be impressed we managed
to track you through the vortex.

21:15.420 --> 21:18.100
I anticipated that you'd need some help.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.090
Corporal Kelly to the bridge.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.690
Go ahead.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.660
Our weapons are passing right through them.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.090
You've got to stop this.

21:36.210 --> 21:37.290
If I don't get full power back, ...

21:37.290 --> 21:39.570
this is gonna take three,
four minutes longer than we thought.

21:39.570 --> 21:41.000
We can't afford three or four minutes.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.020
Corporal Kelly, listen to me very closely.

21:43.020 --> 21:47.740
Modulate your weapons
to a rotating frequency of 32.6 tera-cycles.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.610
Doctor...

21:48.610 --> 21:51.140
Our trans-dimensional friend,
the one we found in the pod, ...

21:51.140 --> 21:53.490
I had quite a few hours to study his physiology.

21:53.490 --> 21:55.580
Let's hope my memory serves me well.

21:56.870 --> 21:59.020
I'll be right in front of you, gentlemen.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.770
Keep a low profile.

22:01.330 --> 22:02.910
We're matching speed.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.290
You said there were no human vessels
in the vicinity!

22:06.590 --> 22:07.760
They're not human.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.510
Destroy them both.

22:17.430 --> 22:19.040
That third torpedo almost got you.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.380
Be careful!

22:20.900 --> 22:22.160
Prepare to come about to port.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.370
Stay below me.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.750
We'll need to get within a kilometer of the weapon.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.360
Just stay below me.

22:33.290 --> 22:35.950
Let's fight back this time, shall we?

22:35.950 --> 22:38.370
Bring the forward cannons on line.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.050
Go!

22:51.830 --> 22:55.100
And tell Archer we're not even anymore.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.020
He owes me.

23:22.130 --> 23:23.910
It's coming back

23:24.040 --> 23:26.040
Tell them to keep doing what they're doing.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.670
Walker to the bridge.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.010
Go ahead.

23:38.010 --> 23:40.810
We've secured Engineering,
but I don't think we've seen the last of them.

23:42.410 --> 23:44.010
It's time for you to work your magic, Mr. Tucker.

23:44.010 --> 23:46.750
Within five minutes, everyone on
this ship is going to start dying.

23:47.650 --> 23:48.720
No pressure.

23:50.410 --> 23:52.850
Okay, bring up the inversion sequence.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.500
Start with the third one from the left.

24:08.600 --> 24:09.530
Got it.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.390
The second from the right.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.220
Hoshi?

24:27.870 --> 24:29.380
I'm all right.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.780
The first one on the left is next.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.740
Commander, the sensors show the humans are
no longer aboard Degra's vessel.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.930
These ships are drawing us away from the weapon.

24:45.170 --> 24:46.530
Get us back!

25:00.510 --> 25:02.220
-What's going on?
- Ignore it, Commander.

25:02.220 --> 25:03.680
You've got less than two minutes.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.200
Got it.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.830
Two to go.

25:58.510 --> 25:59.540
Hoshi?

26:18.660 --> 26:19.870
Reed to Archer.

26:19.870 --> 26:20.680
Go ahead.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.460
I'm pretty certain that was the last of them, sir.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.440
Good work.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.390
Now get down here.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.250
T'Pol...

26:32.440 --> 26:34.090
-T'Pol!
-All right.

26:35.930 --> 26:37.490
Take us to full impulse.

26:37.490 --> 26:38.710
Get us out of here.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.110
Wait a minute, I'm almost there.

26:40.110 --> 26:41.560
You don't have a minute, Commander.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.470
Then give me ten seconds.
I'm telling you, I got it.

26:50.390 --> 26:51.750
That's it, time's up.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.190
It sure is.

27:02.530 --> 27:03.750
Now, Mr. Mayweather.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.780
The network is being destroyed.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.670
Looks like we're getting out of
this soup faster than we thought.

27:36.670 --> 27:40.160
Without the sphere,
their transformed space must be collapsing in on itself.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.920
Which one, Hoshi?

27:46.920 --> 27:49.240
Number four-- the fourth one from the left.

27:49.340 --> 27:50.420
Are you sure?

27:50.420 --> 27:55.200
Yes, yes, number five is
the last one after you disable the reactor.

28:02.810 --> 28:05.230
But if we knock the reactor out won't that be enough?

28:05.230 --> 28:07.500
We didn't come here to disable this weapon.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.530
We came here to destroy it.

28:10.530 --> 28:11.770
Give me the charges.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.490
I'll take care of it, sir.

28:13.490 --> 28:16.340
I want the four of you to get to the outer framework.

28:16.340 --> 28:17.610
Beam back to Degra's ship.

28:17.610 --> 28:18.970
As Chief Tactical Officer...

28:18.970 --> 28:20.890
This is open for debate, Lieutenant.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.020
Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.

29:34.310 --> 29:36.970
What have you done?!

30:15.770 --> 30:17.860
One Reptilian transported to the weapon.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.760
Let's make sure he has nowhere to go back to.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.950
They have no shielding on their starboard engine.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.050
Target all weapons.

30:34.050 --> 30:36.410
-Can you get a lock on him?
- Not yet.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.980
Your captain is too deep within the weapon.

31:54.370 --> 31:58.990
Acting Captain's Star Log:
February 14, 2152.

31:58.990 --> 32:02.600
We're holding position at the coordinates
where we were told to meet Degra's vessel.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.970
So far, there's been no word from them.

32:06.100 --> 32:09.760
Long-range sensors are detecting
no evidence of the spheres.

32:10.880 --> 32:11.900
None of them?

32:12.330 --> 32:13.070
None.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.800
And all the spatial anomalies within
our scanning range have vanished.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.110
What about the thermobaric cloud barrier?

32:25.360 --> 32:28.790
I can only detect a small section
from our present location, but...

32:28.790 --> 32:31.000
it appears to be dissipating.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.430
Looks like we kept our end of the bargain.

32:34.710 --> 32:38.060
It would appear that the Expanse
is returning to normal space.

32:41.150 --> 32:42.800
We should have heard something by now.

32:43.340 --> 32:44.760
What if they failed?

32:44.990 --> 32:46.190
Earth could be...

32:47.760 --> 32:49.190
Just be patient.

32:53.870 --> 32:56.360
My skin's healing faster than yours.

32:57.810 --> 33:00.260
I guess you Vulcans aren't so tough after all.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.910
Dr. Phlox says we should all be back
to normal within two to three days.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.990
I'm only kidding.

33:07.790 --> 33:09.320
You look nice like this.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.020
Kind of like an old oil painting.

33:16.150 --> 33:17.730
I'm not old.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.410
I will only be 66 years old
on my next birthday.

33:24.610 --> 33:26.430
I can't believe you told me that.

33:27.230 --> 33:29.040
You accused me of looking old.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.330
That's not what I mean.

33:30.410 --> 33:33.930
I've been trying to get you to tell me
your age since we left space dock.

33:35.170 --> 33:36.360
Why now?

33:37.110 --> 33:38.740
To Vulcans,..

33:39.220 --> 33:41.800
certain information is considered intimate.

33:43.830 --> 33:44.800
Intimate?

33:46.950 --> 33:48.450
Bridge to T'Pol.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.650
Go ahead.

33:50.650 --> 33:53.160
A vortex just opened.
It's Degra's ship.

33:59.130 --> 34:00.880
This is Enterprise.
Please repeat.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.450
Captain, did you stop the weapon?

34:07.820 --> 34:09.639
Captain?

34:12.969 --> 34:14.719
Set an intercept course.

34:30.770 --> 34:31.540
It's done.

34:33.040 --> 34:33.929
Done?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.639
Captain Archer destroyed the weapon.

34:37.590 --> 34:38.810
Where is he? Is he okay?

34:44.560 --> 34:45.960
Captain didn't make it, Trip.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.080
What do you mean he didn't make it?

34:51.080 --> 34:56.159
The weapon exploded before
he could transport to Degra's ship.

35:19.190 --> 35:20.160
Come in.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.260
Thank you.

35:28.010 --> 35:30.980
The Aquatic vessel should have you
home in less than a day.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.530
I was pleased to hear
that the Council has agreed to reconvene.

35:36.970 --> 35:41.120
It was difficult for the Insectoids
to ignore recent events.

35:42.210 --> 35:43.600
And the Reptilians?

35:44.470 --> 35:46.600
They'll join us eventually.

35:46.940 --> 35:51.540
They have no choice but to accept
that the Guardians' promises were empty.

35:55.530 --> 35:59.020
Your captain's sacrifice will not be forgotten.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.360
Safe journey.

36:05.650 --> 36:06.860
Thank you.

36:15.380 --> 36:16.620
It's all right.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.550
It's all right.
It won't be much longer.

36:19.550 --> 36:21.000
I promise.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.590
Is something wrong?

36:25.810 --> 36:30.540
Oh, I think they sense that
we are traveling in an unusual manner.

36:30.810 --> 36:33.540
In the belly of the beast, so to speak.

36:34.540 --> 36:35.620
There are no windows here.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.590
How would they know
we're inside the Aquatic vessel?

36:38.220 --> 36:40.150
I don't have the slightest idea.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.470
But I doubt I'll get much peace and quiet
around here until we are...

36:43.470 --> 36:45.440
flying under our own power.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.330
Itl only be a few more hours.

36:48.780 --> 36:50.750
Is there something I can do for you?

36:52.950 --> 36:55.010
My skin hasn't fully healed yet.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.310
Oh, you're doing fine.

36:59.730 --> 37:02.190
Vulcans are obviously more sensitive to ...

37:02.370 --> 37:04.460
the effects of the mysterious realms.

37:05.060 --> 37:06.900
I guess we're not so tough after all.

37:07.710 --> 37:08.630
Excuse me?

37:09.910 --> 37:12.130
Is there anything I'll need to treat this?

37:13.060 --> 37:14.320
Only time.

37:16.750 --> 37:17.910
How's morale?

37:20.960 --> 37:23.680
It isn't easy for a crew to lose its captain.

37:25.730 --> 37:28.490
I suppose we'll all need time to heal.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.960
Will he be all right?

37:37.550 --> 37:38.600
Not for a while.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.960
He lost his best friend.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.830
But I think it's just a matter of time.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.120
He'll be fine again.

37:52.580 --> 37:53.740
Did you hear that?

37:54.710 --> 37:56.740
Doctor says you'll be fine.

37:59.090 --> 38:00.490
It's just a matter of time.

38:16.830 --> 38:19.710
- Distance?
-800,000 kilometers.

38:20.780 --> 38:22.120
Set a course, Ensign.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.400
You should be in your quarters.

38:26.400 --> 38:30.120
With all due respect to Phlox,
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

38:35.330 --> 38:37.120
Mind if we take a look?

38:48.710 --> 38:50.890
Prettiest sight I ever saw.

38:52.210 --> 38:53.890
And it's all in one piece.

38:54.570 --> 38:56.190
The captain would be proud.

38:57.260 --> 38:59.450
Open a channel to Starfleet Headquarters.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.260
Strange.

39:08.250 --> 39:09.620
What?

39:09.620 --> 39:11.290
They're not responding.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.430
You'd think they'd be waiting with baited breath.

39:15.870 --> 39:17.550
Try another frequency.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.700
I'm not picking up the orbital platforms.

39:22.870 --> 39:25.550
The Reptilians destroyed Yosemite station.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.470
It's not just Yosemite.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.230
There's nothing coming from any of them.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.500
I've rotated through all the frequencies.

39:36.570 --> 39:38.270
Contact the Lunar One colony.

39:38.270 --> 39:39.510
I already tried.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.950
Prepare a shuttle pod. I want you and
Ensign Mayweather to get down to San Francisco.

39:48.950 --> 39:50.670
Find out what's wrong.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.020
Looks pretty normal to me.

40:11.590 --> 40:14.200
Then why the hell doesn't anyone want to talk to us?

40:16.720 --> 40:18.560
Land at the pad behind the Command Center.

40:19.990 --> 40:20.940
Finally.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.000
We've got three vessels approaching.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.220
It's about time.

40:25.870 --> 40:28.930
This is Commander Charles Tucker of the starship Enterprise.

40:29.150 --> 40:31.350
You guys gave us quite a...

40:32.770 --> 40:34.350
What the hell...?

40:35.330 --> 40:36.300
Sir...
