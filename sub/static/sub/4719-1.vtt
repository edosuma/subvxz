03:17.564 --> 03:18.929
Strange.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.993
Who'd do something like this?

03:23.603 --> 03:26.436
Maybe someone got a little upset
about their roaming charges.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.069
Stealing satellite phones
makes sense. You can hock them.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.044
You can run up charges
on somebody else's account.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.682
But burning them?

03:38.418 --> 03:39.680
Youngsters?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.717
Pulling some prank?

03:42.188 --> 03:43.621
No.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.315
They'd have left a note.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.226
"Fuck you" to their parents...

03:49.596 --> 03:51.928
...or the world or whatever.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.395
Not a bad idea, though.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.122
I brought Peggy here
on our first date.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.260
Yeah, we all did.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.728
Not Peggy, of course.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.797
Yeah, I got you.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.435
Last sunset in a month...

04:36.643 --> 04:38.076
...always works.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.743
Come on. Let's go do the sign.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.645
You okay, Eben?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.983
Yeah.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.629
Why do you even bother with that?
Nobody's gonna see it for a month.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.133
It's tradition.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.150
Put this off till the last minute,
didn't you?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.022
There's a lot of small towns
in this state.

06:03.229 --> 06:07.063
My boss wants all his gear inspected
and certified by the 31st.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.295
And I noticed you saved
Barrow for the last.

06:12.905 --> 06:15.203
You sure you don't wanna stay?

06:15.675 --> 06:17.666
Me and Jeannie were hoping
you and Eben...

06:17.877 --> 06:21.404
...might rethink
this separation thing.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.611
Thanks.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.485
I...

06:28.388 --> 06:30.322
...gotta make the plane.

06:38.598 --> 06:42.557
Okay, sweetie. I know you can't
handle a month with no sun.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.704
I promise I won't live on
Oreos and Snapple, all right?

06:51.744 --> 06:52.870
Have fun in Seattle.

06:53.079 --> 06:57.709
Yeah. So long, Kirsten.
I'll call you when I get there.

06:59.619 --> 07:00.984
Goodbye.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.024
Got a problem?

07:44.931 --> 07:47.365
Nothing I can't handle
my own fucking self.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.304
This for generators?

07:57.777 --> 07:59.836
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.380
Beau, I have to cite you for it.
I can't have it leaking on the street.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.248
What?

08:12.058 --> 08:13.753
For that? You don't...

08:13.960 --> 08:17.919
You don't have to cite me.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.989
You don't have to do anything.

08:23.102 --> 08:26.128
Isn't that why we live out here?

08:26.572 --> 08:28.972
You know, for a little freedom?

08:31.043 --> 08:32.635
Happy motoring.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.919
Yeah, I'll add it to my collection.

08:44.155 --> 08:47.592
You know, Beau's not so bad.
Why'd you bother writing him up?

08:48.628 --> 08:51.859
He lives all alone out there
on the south ridge.

08:52.298 --> 08:56.200
A little citation now and then
lets him know he's a part of this town.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.263
<i>Eben? Come in, Eben.</i>

09:02.775 --> 09:03.764
Yeah, Helen.

09:03.976 --> 09:07.070
<i>Something bad's happened
to John Riis' dogs.</i>

09:15.087 --> 09:18.989
<i>Well, folks, you're listening
to KBRW, Barrow, Alaska.</i>

09:19.191 --> 09:20.249
<i>Today's the last day...</i>

09:23.229 --> 09:26.096
<i>I'm leaving too, getting
on that last plane out of here.</i>

09:48.821 --> 09:50.049
Hey, Stella, are you okay?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.454
Damn it, Malekai.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.560
Don't you know what
"right of way" means?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.129
I'm sorry, Stella.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.361
The brakes jammed and...

10:02.568 --> 10:05.867
Eben wanted this back from the airport
before the storm hit, and I was...

10:06.072 --> 10:09.132
Oh, shit.
Who's gonna run me to the airport?

10:09.909 --> 10:11.672
Well, wouldn't Eben?

10:13.412 --> 10:15.573
My mom could come down
and give you a tow...

10:15.781 --> 10:18.079
...but, you know,
she don't move too fast.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.249
Fuck! Where's my phone?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.136
It's me.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.715
Surprise.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.355
I... I need a ride to the airport.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.415
What?

11:01.894 --> 11:04.294
You're in town,
and you didn't wanna talk?

11:04.497 --> 11:09.525
<i>I had fire-marshal work here,
and I just had a little accident.</i>

11:09.735 --> 11:12.101
I'm stuck on Ransom and 355.
The airport'll close...

11:12.304 --> 11:14.431
...and I'll never get to Anchorage.

11:18.911 --> 11:22.005
I mean, if you wanna talk,
we can do it on the drive.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.944
Hey, Billy.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.122
Stella's stuck at Ransom and 355.

11:30.322 --> 11:33.155
She needs a ride to the airport.
Can you go get her?

11:38.264 --> 11:39.731
Yeah.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.163
John Riis needs me
for something...

11:42.368 --> 11:44.461
...so Billy's gonna come get you.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.703
Let me know if a day comes
when you do wanna talk.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.104
What sick jerk would do this?

12:22.308 --> 12:26.039
Every kennel. Every dog we had.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.013
Did you fight with anyone
recently, John?

12:32.985 --> 12:36.318
I'll kill them. I'll kill them.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.647
This wasn't done long ago.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.419
I'll find them. Okay?

12:52.338 --> 12:53.600
You'll be okay, Malekai.

12:59.044 --> 13:02.275
- Where have you been?
- I couldn't find the damn car keys.

13:02.481 --> 13:06.713
Then I was like, "Wait, was that
Rogers and 355 or Ransom?"

13:06.919 --> 13:08.978
- And then...
- Yeah, never mind. Let's go.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.950
It would be a lot easier
if you just played, Grandma.

13:16.162 --> 13:20.496
Oh, I don't really care for those sort of
games, if you wanna know the truth.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.500
Try your brother.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.803
- What?
- Eben, do you wanna play?

13:29.275 --> 13:31.505
I can't right now, Jake. Sorry.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.045
While you were busy with John Riis,
Carter and Wilson called...

13:35.247 --> 13:37.909
...about a vandalism problem
at the Utilidor.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.586
Thanks.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.660
Call Point Hope and Wainwright.
See if they're having any troubles.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.232
No.

14:07.913 --> 14:11.076
I am not trapped here for a month.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.092
- There's someone you can bunk with.
- Don't start, Billy.

14:22.294 --> 14:26.025
Peggy and me can put two girls in one
room. You'd have a place of your own.

14:26.232 --> 14:29.724
I can't stay here. I've got bills
to put in the mail. My plants'll die.

14:30.736 --> 14:31.998
It'll all work out.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.434
Of course, the price
of staying at my place...

14:35.641 --> 14:39.133
...is explaining to me and Peggy
just what is wrong with you and Eben.

14:44.917 --> 14:48.353
Not enough time this century
to cover that, Billy.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.880
Eben, how you doing?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.571
- Good to see you.
- Hey, Carter.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.614
Lord, it's gotta be
10 below out here.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.979
- Eben.
- Wilson.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.689
Can't your wife bring you up
a sweater or two?

15:33.699 --> 15:35.690
Bring the whole tribe up
while she's at it?

15:37.036 --> 15:38.936
They'll come when they're ready,
I guess.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.830
So...

15:41.040 --> 15:44.601
...I've found all kinds of garbage
in here over the years.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.005
Blue jeans, bikes...

15:47.212 --> 15:50.670
Sometimes I can yank them out before
the muffin monster chews them to shit.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.783
The muffin monster?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.718
I saw Wilson's helicopter logo.

16:02.928 --> 16:05.294
Pulled that stuff out
before it got totally trashed.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.770
You keep your copter
under lock and key, don't you?

16:12.972 --> 16:16.601
Yeah, I put it in dry dock
when the tourists headed south.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.935
I haven't looked at it for days.
They ripped out the throttle...

16:20.145 --> 16:22.705
...the rotors,
half the fucking helicopter!

16:23.015 --> 16:24.607
It's my life, Eben.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.582
Why would someone
rip the hell out of my bird?

18:00.479 --> 18:02.106
Hey! Stop!

18:03.916 --> 18:05.713
Stop! Stop!

18:06.218 --> 18:07.242
Who are you people?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.266
No whiskey?

18:25.871 --> 18:27.532
No rum?

18:27.739 --> 18:29.434
Alcohol's illegal this month.

18:31.009 --> 18:34.410
Folks have a hard enough time in the
dark without booze making it worse.

18:36.215 --> 18:39.343
Well, forget about the liquor...

18:39.651 --> 18:41.312
...Lucy.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.115
Just bring me a bowl of...

18:45.324 --> 18:47.155
...raw hamburger.

18:47.359 --> 18:51.489
You can only get meat two ways
around here, frozen or burnt.

18:54.266 --> 18:58.066
You don't bring me what I wanna eat,
what I wanna drink.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.295
That's enough, pal.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.606
Leave the lady be.

19:25.931 --> 19:29.560
Hey, what do you say the two of us
go outside and have a little talk, huh?

19:31.136 --> 19:36.733
Well, now, what's wrong with a man
wanting a little fresh meat?

19:39.912 --> 19:41.846
Come on. You and me, let's go.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.179
I'm taking you outside.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.581
I would like to see that.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.024
I would too.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.762
But then Lucy'd have to clean up
after Eben kicked your ass.

20:02.668 --> 20:05.159
It's more trouble than you're worth.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.173
Hey, be nice!

20:15.814 --> 20:17.247
Enough.

20:17.449 --> 20:18.939
Stay down.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.948
Fire marshal's office lets you carry
one of those things?

20:25.157 --> 20:28.490
It's a funny thing, I never asked.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.288
So you missed your flight?

20:31.496 --> 20:34.431
That sucks. Where you gonna stay?

20:39.338 --> 20:43.240
Billy and Peggy are putting me up.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.940
Well, I'll talk to you sometime,
I guess.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.649
Hey, listen.

20:55.821 --> 20:59.917
Look, maybe I'll come along
and say hi to Jake and Helen.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.596
Bye, Luce.

21:14.806 --> 21:18.037
We haven't seen vandalism
like this in a long time.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.038
Don't you know how to take care
of this town without me?

21:32.190 --> 21:34.658
Malekai totaled my car.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.428
Hell of a day.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.687
Just you wait.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.644
Hey, Jake.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.258
- Where are we going?
- I'm heading back to your house.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.448
My landlady...

22:08.660 --> 22:11.356
...doesn't want pipeline workers
keeping her up all night.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.155
Denise is right.

22:13.432 --> 22:16.833
- Let's head back to my place.
- Neither of you are getting me alone.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.593
Neither!

22:18.970 --> 22:22.235
We share, right?
None of us have to be greedy.

22:22.441 --> 22:26.070
- Yeah, come on. We'll be good.
- Oh, you will?

22:26.278 --> 22:29.839
- Where's the fun in that, Gabe?
- You bad little bitch.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.913
All right, all right,
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.515
- Whoever wins, we go to his place.
- Good idea. Let's do it.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.586
- Come on.
- Hurry up, let's get moving.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.018
On three.

22:40.759 --> 22:42.192
One, two...

22:45.497 --> 22:47.021
Gabe?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.960
Gabe?

22:51.770 --> 22:52.896
Gabe!

23:13.191 --> 23:15.352
Let me tell you what I got.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.563
You don't work at the refinery.

23:19.498 --> 23:23.025
You didn't fly in.
Somebody'd have seen you.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.698
And you're definitely
not from around here.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.873
How'd you get in?

23:37.215 --> 23:38.705
All right.

23:41.286 --> 23:45.416
We got a long time to figure this out.
Nobody's coming for you for a month.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.176
Jake, come here a second.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.452
What the hell is that?

24:15.821 --> 24:19.848
It's pot. It helps her with her cancer.

24:20.058 --> 24:23.824
Didn't tell you I got a little greenhouse
at home. Didn't want you arresting me.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.993
Now I know why you wanted
to live with Grandma.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.965
No, I just thought you and Stella
ought to have some privacy.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.035
Well, that worked out.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.375
Computer's down.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.408
I'll call Gus.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.212
Strange.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.657
The phone's down too.

24:52.858 --> 24:56.294
Mr. And Mrs. Sheriff.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.522
So sweet.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.493
So...

25:01.700 --> 25:05.659
...helpless against what is coming.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.972
He's just trying to freak us out.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.168
It's working.

25:13.979 --> 25:16.413
We have more important things
to think about.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.715
- I'll check on Gus.
- Check on Gus.

25:20.385 --> 25:22.376
Bar the windows.

25:22.587 --> 25:24.384
Try to hide.

25:24.890 --> 25:26.721
They're coming.

25:28.260 --> 25:32.754
This time they gonna
take me with them, honor me.

25:33.598 --> 25:37.398
Yeah. For all that I have done.

25:38.470 --> 25:39.994
"They"?

25:44.276 --> 25:45.368
Who are "they"?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.452
The generator's kicked in.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.071
- I'm heading out to the cell tower.
- We have to stay here with him?

26:19.744 --> 26:22.542
Sure. We'll keep an eye on him.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.810
As soon as the lines are back up,
get Billy over here.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.850
Stay on the walkie-talkie with me
until the power's back.

26:50.175 --> 26:51.665
Gus!

27:02.120 --> 27:03.485
Gus?

27:34.919 --> 27:39.686
This is Sheriff Eben Oleson.
Stay in your homes, lock your doors...

27:40.125 --> 27:43.026
...and load your firearms.
This is not a drill.

27:44.529 --> 27:47.020
- Is your genny up and running?
- Yeah.

27:47.832 --> 27:51.165
Anyone with a genny should go home
immediately, just to be safe.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.803
If you don't have one,
you should meet at the diner.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.803
I heard gunshots, Eben.
What the hell is going on?

27:57.108 --> 27:58.632
I don't know.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.879
Just go home.
I'll let you know when I find out, okay?

28:04.082 --> 28:05.242
Okay.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.587
Come on, guys. Let's go.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.386
Let's just have dinner, John.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.158
Please?

28:46.491 --> 28:48.823
John! John!

28:49.094 --> 28:50.288
- Ally!
- John!

28:51.096 --> 28:53.360
No! No! John!

28:56.568 --> 28:58.035
John!

29:06.444 --> 29:08.378
John!

29:08.580 --> 29:10.514
No!

29:13.017 --> 29:14.609
John!

29:14.819 --> 29:16.377
Ally! Ally!

29:17.756 --> 29:20.054
- John! John!
- Ally!

29:20.258 --> 29:21.418
- Oh, my God!
- Ally!

29:21.626 --> 29:24.356
- John! John!
- Ally!

29:24.562 --> 29:27.588
Oh, my God. No!

29:30.401 --> 29:32.494
No way out of town.

29:33.304 --> 29:34.794
No one to come help.

29:35.006 --> 29:37.031
- Shut up.
- Ignore him, Jake.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.301
You can feel it.

29:42.013 --> 29:47.110
That cold ain't the weather,
that's death approaching.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.955
Who you think
they gonna take first?

29:53.925 --> 29:58.624
The girl who thinks
a gun will help her?

29:58.997 --> 30:02.091
The kid, sheriff's kid?
Or the old gal?

30:02.367 --> 30:04.062
Shut up!

30:08.006 --> 30:09.132
Yeah.

30:10.408 --> 30:13.002
Thank you for the plastique.

30:13.211 --> 30:17.409
I can snap that apart
and pick the lock.

30:17.615 --> 30:20.675
- No, you won't.
- Jake, he can't. Jake.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.081
Jake.

30:34.265 --> 30:35.994
You shithead.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.064
Helen, get the first-aid kit.

30:50.849 --> 30:55.013
All right, time to talk.
Who are you here with?

30:55.386 --> 30:56.819
Who are you here with?

31:00.458 --> 31:02.722
Who did that to Gus?

31:04.929 --> 31:07.227
You're a dead man.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.530
Where are they?!

31:10.602 --> 31:13.002
I don't talk to dead men.

31:13.838 --> 31:16.500
I don't talk to dead men!

31:19.177 --> 31:21.771
Well, if I'm dead,
no one lets you loose from here.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.238
You're all dead!

31:32.457 --> 31:34.789
I can take care of that for now,
but Doc Miller...

31:34.993 --> 31:38.690
No. Wait till the power's back.
Call Doc Miller then.

31:38.963 --> 31:41.523
This fucker doesn't deserve
anything till then.

31:48.072 --> 31:53.100
Billy and I'll work our way
from South Street to the pipeline.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.481
His friends don't have
many places to hide.

31:59.284 --> 32:01.115
I'll join you.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.451
No, we got it.

32:05.823 --> 32:08.690
Right now, you, me and Billy
are the authorities.

32:08.893 --> 32:11.487
It'd be stupid not to take more help.

32:11.696 --> 32:14.529
We got walkie-talkies. We'll be fine.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.671
There's a Taser in the back.
If he gives you any trouble...

32:20.872 --> 32:23.340
...use it. Okay?

32:23.775 --> 32:26.039
You drive. I'm riding shotgun.

32:31.749 --> 32:34.274
- Stop the truck.
- What?

32:34.686 --> 32:35.846
Stop the fucking truck.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.529
I thought I saw something.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.214
- Get in the truck.
- What?

33:05.717 --> 33:06.911
Get in the fucking truck!

33:20.365 --> 33:21.923
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

33:31.042 --> 33:32.532
- Holy shit!
- Fuck!

33:44.689 --> 33:46.247
What the hell was that?

34:02.573 --> 34:05.508
Shit! What was that?
Where was that? Where was that?

34:06.310 --> 34:08.039
<i>No!</i>

34:08.346 --> 34:09.505
<i>- Helen!
- Help!</i>

34:09.714 --> 34:12.581
Helen! Helen, come in!

34:20.324 --> 34:21.382
Jake?

34:21.958 --> 34:22.947
Helen?

34:24.862 --> 34:26.159
Are you here?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.929
Oh, shit.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.282
They didn't take me.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.592
Who did they take?

34:56.594 --> 34:59.427
They didn't take me.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.262
Did they take my brother?

35:20.351 --> 35:22.216
Finish me off.

35:27.158 --> 35:29.092
Finish me.

35:32.363 --> 35:33.796
Eben.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.667
Eben, look at me.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.662
No.

35:58.189 --> 36:05.186
The heads must be separated
from the bodies.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.696
Do not turn them.

36:14.372 --> 36:18.069
We should have come here ages ago.

36:43.634 --> 36:45.465
What are they?

36:48.639 --> 36:50.368
We don't know.

36:50.575 --> 36:54.409
- Wilson, I wanna go home.
- It's okay. Dad!

36:54.612 --> 36:57.740
- It's okay.
- You keep shooting and they just...

36:58.249 --> 36:59.648
They just keep coming.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.751
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.980
Maybe they're all coked up
on PCP or something, you know.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.283
They don't feel any bullets.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.667
They killed every sled dog in town.

37:21.038 --> 37:23.268
They took Aaron and Gabe.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.099
They killed my grandmother.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.397
There is no escape.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.174
No hope.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.771
Only hunger and pain.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.577
What are you? What are you?

40:10.441 --> 40:13.569
- Lucy, is the back door locked? Okay.
- All locked.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.103
Jake?

40:18.816 --> 40:22.013
- Eben! Eben!
- Jake.

40:23.554 --> 40:26.955
- Who the hell are these people, Eben?
- What do they want?

40:32.630 --> 40:35.428
We'll figure that out when we
get you guys someplace safe.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.864
There's a generator at the Utilidor.

40:39.069 --> 40:42.800
No, that's way out on the edge of town.
We need someplace close to hide.

40:43.007 --> 40:43.996
Now.

40:46.410 --> 40:48.275
Charlie Kelso's attic.

40:49.046 --> 40:51.480
It has a pull-down ladder.
You can't tell it's there.

40:52.349 --> 40:54.817
He would've boarded up
his home before he left.

40:55.419 --> 40:57.284
Which is exactly why
it's a good idea.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.951
We'll pull down a board to get in,
then we'll tack it back.

41:01.492 --> 41:02.720
Carter.

41:07.097 --> 41:09.588
I want you to lead everybody
close to the buildings.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.961
If you hear anything,
roll under a crawlspace.

41:12.169 --> 41:15.730
Go straight to Kelso's attic.
I'll meet you there.

41:16.106 --> 41:17.903
What are you gonna do?

41:20.511 --> 41:24.345
I'm gonna load up with as many bear
traps and flares as a 4x4 can carry.

41:24.882 --> 41:27.146
Something's gotta slow them down.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.322
I'm coming with you.

41:36.927 --> 41:37.916
Okay.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.749
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

42:05.256 --> 42:06.245
Shit!

42:13.864 --> 42:15.331
Fuck!

42:17.801 --> 42:19.132
Shit!

42:34.351 --> 42:36.080
Eben!

42:38.889 --> 42:40.516
No!

42:45.829 --> 42:47.057
Go! Get out of here!

42:49.066 --> 42:50.590
Shit. Shit. Shit.

42:58.275 --> 42:59.765
Move it. Move it!

43:01.779 --> 43:03.269
Come on!

43:12.022 --> 43:13.387
Go!

43:19.830 --> 43:21.991
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

43:22.199 --> 43:25.191
- We gotta lose this thing.
- And go where?

43:25.869 --> 43:27.700
We know a place.

43:44.421 --> 43:45.888
Okay.

43:57.501 --> 43:58.798
Go.

44:19.023 --> 44:20.991
These seem to work.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.993
It's well hidden.

44:39.410 --> 44:40.775
Hey.

44:47.651 --> 44:49.619
Two, three.

45:25.789 --> 45:27.689
I saw them...

45:29.159 --> 45:31.923
...feed on Grandma Helen.

45:33.764 --> 45:37.097
They're like vampires, you know?

45:39.269 --> 45:41.169
Vampires don't exist, Jake.

45:42.239 --> 45:44.264
They don't fall
when you shoot them.

45:45.142 --> 45:46.575
Hell, neither do I.

45:47.444 --> 45:51.073
Well, I don't care what they are.
I just care what we do about them.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.446
What are we gonna do about them?

45:58.589 --> 46:00.614
We'll sleep in shifts.

46:02.326 --> 46:06.057
We'll ration our food, and then
we'll figure out the next step.

46:08.632 --> 46:12.295
We have two advantages.
We know this town...

46:13.036 --> 46:14.298
...and we know the cold.

46:15.539 --> 46:17.166
We live here for a reason.

46:19.309 --> 46:21.470
Because nobody else can.

46:29.253 --> 46:31.244
Yeah, right.

46:53.010 --> 46:58.175
You did all that I asked.

47:06.490 --> 47:10.551
We will take care of you.

47:34.852 --> 47:39.084
The things they believe.

47:59.676 --> 48:02.372
I guess it's good
you didn't want kids, huh?

48:03.714 --> 48:05.477
Imagine.

48:08.252 --> 48:10.550
Where...? Where's Catherine?
Where's Catherine?

48:10.754 --> 48:13.154
- Dad. Dad. Dad.
- What?

48:13.357 --> 48:16.656
Dad, Mom died a long time ago.

48:19.196 --> 48:20.390
Isaac...

48:20.597 --> 48:24.931
...you should go to sleep now.
You should go to sleep.

48:25.402 --> 48:29.395
That's right. That's right.
You should go to sleep.

48:32.209 --> 48:33.904
Thank you.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.420
They're ransacking
the Clarks' place.

48:55.299 --> 48:57.199
They're tearing through
everyone's home.

48:57.467 --> 49:00.903
- We have to move.
- When do you suggest we do that?

49:01.405 --> 49:04.306
Now, while we have the strength.

49:05.075 --> 49:08.306
Until we have some way to stop them,
it's suicide, Lucy.

49:08.512 --> 49:11.106
We can stay here
until they find us...

49:11.315 --> 49:13.306
...and they can kill us all,
or we can run.

49:13.517 --> 49:16.111
Some won't make it,
but it's better than all of us dying!

49:16.320 --> 49:18.117
- Shut up!
- Doug, you should sit down.

49:18.355 --> 49:19.617
Maybe Denise or Lucy dies...

49:19.823 --> 49:22.121
...but that's okay so long as
you have a chance?

49:22.326 --> 49:24.351
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

49:32.436 --> 49:33.630
Stupid.

49:40.911 --> 49:44.745
Start a fight, that'll get us all
killed a lot faster.

49:55.792 --> 49:56.850
Okay.

50:01.965 --> 50:05.662
We go to the general store to get
supplies, then we go to the Utilidor.

50:11.308 --> 50:13.674
But we'll never make it there
without cover.

50:15.012 --> 50:18.641
We get there,
we can last the month.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.840
The next blizzard, we'll be ready.

50:31.762 --> 50:33.662
Hello!

50:35.165 --> 50:37.133
Somebody!

50:43.106 --> 50:45.336
Help!

50:46.143 --> 50:48.008
Come on.

50:49.946 --> 50:52.107
Help!

50:53.683 --> 50:55.810
Please!

50:56.953 --> 50:58.978
Anyone?

51:00.891 --> 51:02.722
Hello?

51:05.429 --> 51:07.420
Anyone?

51:08.198 --> 51:10.166
Help!

51:13.703 --> 51:15.671
We need to get her in
before they find her.

51:15.872 --> 51:17.567
- Wait.
- What?

51:18.041 --> 51:20.669
Look at the rooftops behind her.

51:25.816 --> 51:28.284
Please!

51:32.222 --> 51:34.520
They're using her as bait.

52:03.220 --> 52:04.653
Please.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.356
Please, no. I tried.

52:08.558 --> 52:10.321
There isn't anybody left.

52:16.199 --> 52:17.996
Please.

52:19.136 --> 52:22.469
Please, God. Please.

52:23.673 --> 52:25.834
God?

52:42.726 --> 52:43.988
No God.

53:03.513 --> 53:04.707
Eben.

53:13.390 --> 53:14.982
Eben!

53:22.098 --> 53:23.531
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

54:06.009 --> 54:08.739
I've known Kirsten my whole life.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.268
I'm going out.

54:10.480 --> 54:12.380
Why we waiting?
While they're feeding...

54:12.582 --> 54:14.607
...we could make a run for it.

54:14.818 --> 54:17.309
- I can kill these things.
- We'll die in here otherwise.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.283
Eben doesn't know what he's doing!

54:19.489 --> 54:20.456
- Just move.
- Beau.

54:20.657 --> 54:22.716
We agreed to keep
the bigger weapon here.

54:22.926 --> 54:25.394
- Just move!
- We need you here.

54:35.872 --> 54:37.533
Okay.

54:37.774 --> 54:39.765
Okay. Okay.

54:51.254 --> 54:52.778
John.

54:54.257 --> 54:56.384
How long have you
been under there?

54:57.427 --> 54:58.621
I'm not sure.

54:59.195 --> 55:00.685
Where's Ally?

55:01.865 --> 55:04.026
Took Ally.

55:04.234 --> 55:05.997
Couldn't follow.

55:07.203 --> 55:08.898
You're okay?

55:11.041 --> 55:14.442
- The leg hurts.
- Okay.

55:15.612 --> 55:18.342
I know a safe place.

55:18.548 --> 55:22.314
I'm gonna pull you out.
But stay quiet.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.079
Come on.

55:28.291 --> 55:30.259
So hungry.

55:30.927 --> 55:33.691
Yeah, we'll get you
something to eat. Yeah.

55:40.637 --> 55:42.298
What happened to you?

55:43.340 --> 55:44.739
Shit!

55:53.350 --> 55:54.942
Eben.

55:56.152 --> 55:57.278
Come on.

56:01.691 --> 56:03.454
John.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.060
John! Stay back! Stay back!

56:17.440 --> 56:18.634
John.

56:19.976 --> 56:21.341
Stay back!

57:18.168 --> 57:19.726
Are you hurt?

57:19.969 --> 57:22.028
- There's blood.
- He can't breathe.

57:22.238 --> 57:24.206
I'm okay. I'm okay.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.341
Where's your inhaler?

57:27.710 --> 57:30.543
- I lost it.
- Oh, shit.

57:37.554 --> 57:39.954
John Riis became one of them.

58:37.714 --> 58:39.011
Isaac.

58:43.653 --> 58:46.178
No. Isaac.

58:46.422 --> 58:48.686
I'm walking to Wainwright.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.152
It's 80 miles.
There's no way to get there.

58:52.462 --> 58:54.657
- Just go back upstairs.
- Wilson.

58:54.864 --> 58:58.027
Come on down. We need to get
out of here. Bring your mother too.

58:58.234 --> 59:00.759
- Okay, we'll die if you go out there.
- No!

59:00.970 --> 59:05.134
No. I'll die if I stay here. That's what's
gonna happen. Leave me alone.

59:06.676 --> 59:07.734
What's she doing?

59:08.311 --> 59:10.779
Just... Just keep quiet.

59:12.982 --> 59:15.348
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

59:19.188 --> 59:21.122
Let's just go back upstairs.

59:21.324 --> 59:23.622
Can l...? There's a bathroom?

59:24.327 --> 59:26.522
No... Okay, remember
you can't flush.

59:26.729 --> 59:29.061
We'll just open the valve afterwards.

59:50.553 --> 59:53.351
Who would have thought
we'd make it this long, huh?

59:53.556 --> 59:54.818
We're ahead of the curve.

59:55.024 --> 59:57.754
Every day they need more food.
They'll be back.

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.691
Dad? Dad?

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.369
Dad!

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.536
No noise!

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.447
- Wait! You can't just rush out.
- He's my father.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.114
Wait! No!

01:00:50.513 --> 01:00:52.947
Stella, are you all right?
What happened?

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.084
Isaac went to Wainwright.

01:00:56.953 --> 01:01:00.480
- Wilson went to find him.
- How long you been down here?

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.921
Dad!

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.864
Dad!

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.858
Dad!

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.396
Dad!

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.397
I should've fought harder.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.765
Kept Wilson here.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.678
It's hard to stop someone
when their family's at stake.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:11.579
The things you'll do
to save your own.

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.786
We were like that once.

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.288
Weren't we?

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.129
It's gone.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.971
It's snowing.

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.437
As soon as it's safe,
we have to move.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.454
You four, canned goods.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.591
Stella, Carter, propane, batteries.

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:34.957
Jake, medical supplies. We meet
back here in two minutes. Let's go.

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:04.723
I promised my wife I wouldn't live
on these things while she was gone.

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.292
She'll cut you slack.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.718
Oh, God.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.251
I'm done playing with this one.

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.789
You wanna play with me now?

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:46.698
Come on!

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.063
What?

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:57.075
Okay.

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.380
Wait.

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:57.261
Somebody!

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.235
Somebody get the ax!

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.953
She was just a girl.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.568
You did the right thing.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.674
It's okay.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:50.817
Who was she?

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.291
I mean, does anybody
recognize her?

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.229
No.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:57.857
No.

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.166
The whiteout's over.

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:16.412
We have to move.

01:09:16.618 --> 01:09:18.678
We can't stay here.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:21.322
But the Utilidor's too far
without cover.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:27.819
Eben?

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:33.460
Could we make it to your station
if somebody created a diversion?

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.232
How?

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.145
These things can't survive the sun.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.974
What if we brought the sun early?

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.881
Helen had that operation at home.

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:55.314
Yeah. She used an ultraviolet light
to grow the stuff.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:59.324
Yeah. I can run for her place,
let them follow me.

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:03.089
Hit them with the sun lamp while the
rest of you go to the sheriff's station.

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:05.324
Just because something
stopped Bela Lugosi...

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.230
...doesn't mean it can stop
these things.

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:11.600
Why would they send that stranger
to cut us off...

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:14.002
...if they can handle the light?

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.510
What if it doesn't work?

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.312
It has to.

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:30.349
I'll do it.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:33.461
- I'm the fastest.
- Bullshit.

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.726
I weigh less than you
and I know Grandma's house.

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:40.493
- You're 15 years old. Forget about it.
- I'm 15. Right.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:43.365
- You've got a wife. People need you.
- Jake.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.367
I saw you in the back with the ax.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.708
You think you're up to doing that
three or four more times?

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:54.281
You don't even think
this plan'll work.

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.211
Yeah, but you do.

01:10:58.187 --> 01:10:59.484
I'm going.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.022
I'll see you at the station.

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:05.016
You'll need to start her genny first.

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.460
See you soon.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.464
Hey!

01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:37.252
- Come on.
- Go, go, go.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:43.596
Hey!

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.563
Come on, motherfuckers!

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:50.663
Hey!

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.835
Come on. Come on.

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:54.065
Come on!

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.219
Let me check.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:22.055
Okay, quick. Come in.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.425
Come on, Stella.

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.366
<i>You there?</i>

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:44.846
Yeah. Yeah, it worked.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.940
But they're gonna cut off
the power, so...

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:24.949
<i>Stella. I got out.</i>

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:28.222
It's good to hear your voice.

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:30.084
<i>Don't wait for me.</i>

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.828
Please.

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.589
Eben.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:44.696
Run for Rogers Avenue,
towards the trencher.

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.442
It's my turn.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.436
You do understand?

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:29.046
What can be broken must be broken.

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.330
Fuck off!

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.813
Welcome to Barrow,
top of the world.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.740
You ain't gonna eat me.

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:18.814
When a man meets a force...

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.718
...he can't destroy...

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.526
...he destroys himself instead.

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:31.531
What a plague you are.

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.121
Beau...

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:02.893
And Doug.

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.787
Now there's six of us.

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:38.357
Soon there'll be just five.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:49.672
The little girl in the store.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.647
I changed.

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:55.641
I'm just so thirsty now.

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:03.884
I couldn't tell you.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:08.690
That photo's all I've got left
of my family.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.632
Martha was taking the kids
to visit her mom.

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:19.570
They were hit...

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:23.303
...by a drunk driver.

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:31.679
I wanted to be with them so much.

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:39.427
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:46.597
But I know they're waiting for me.

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:54.698
I can't live forever.

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.274
I can't.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:00.737
Eben.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.549
Don't let me.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.721
No, Carter.

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:13.719
He told us what he wants.

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.975
Did you see that?

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:41.982
Yeah.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:51.315
It's Billy.

01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:19.953
Billy.

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:52.251
It's Peggy and the girls.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:57.289
I heard the screams.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:01.691
I didn't want them to die
like the rest.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.457
I tried to shoot myself too.

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:09.193
The fucking gun jammed.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.075
I shouldn't have signaled to you.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:21.142
I just couldn't stand
being on my own.

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.630
You have a family.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.438
You don't ever hurt them!

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:51.904
Don't ever hurt them.

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:13.195
Maybe they tried for the Utilidor.

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:03.280
Gail.

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:05.951
Gail.

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.019
No. Stella.

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.962
Stella.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:27.299
I'll meet you at the Utilidor.

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:37.109
No, Billy, stay there!

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:16.481
Eben!

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:18.949
Jake.

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:22.786
Jake.

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.058
Stella?

01:29:32.767 --> 01:29:34.667
Gail Robbins?

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.534
We don't know.

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:54.621
It took centuries for us...

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:56.786
...to make them believe...

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:05.526
...we were only bad dreams.

01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:16.404
We cannot give them reason
to suspect.

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.478
Destroy them all.

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:20.640
Stella, this is Eben. Come in.

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:24.037
Where are you?

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.279
Hello?

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:40.154
- Hello?
- Stella. This is Eben.

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.829
- Come in.
- Anyone?

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:09.717
Eben!

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.520
Billy. Bill, hey. Billy!

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:48.320
- Go!
- No. Billy.

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:49.921
Shit. Shit.

01:32:57.338 --> 01:32:58.327
Eben!

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.490
Hey.

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:57.261
I found these behind Carter's desk.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.559
Chocolates, vitamins and vodka.

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.628
Stella, come in. This is Eben.

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:07.936
We should celebrate.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.937
One day till sunrise.

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:25.484
You did good
getting everybody here.

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.525
<i>Eben.</i>

01:34:39.006 --> 01:34:40.769
Stella.

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:44.771
<i>Whisper. They're walking around.</i>

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:48.971
<i>I just had to hear your voice.
I've got Gail with me.</i>

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.582
Where are you?

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:53.618
Opposite the Melanson's,
under a wreck.

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:08.428
- Are you okay?
- It's so cold.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.630
We're freezing, Eben.

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:14.972
I can see the car.
The wreck on the right.

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.375
We're coming to get you.

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.009
There's way too many of them.

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.743
They'd kill us before we got to her.

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:38.688
We have to cut off
or they'll hear you.

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:42.728
I'll call you back when it's safe.

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:48.767
<i>The sun comes up tomorrow.</i>

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:52.543
<i>We're gonna watch it together.</i>

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.612
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:35:58.552 --> 01:36:01.146
<i>I should never have left you.</i>

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:07.888
The street's filling up with oil.

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:17.300
They broke into the pipeline.

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:49.228
They're burning down the town.

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:07.718
Nobody will know what happened.

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:11.983
They'll just think it was
some horrible accident.

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:21.732
Next time they'll take out
Point Hope, Wainwright.

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:29.208
Wait. Wait.

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:33.008
This building's strong.
Can't we just ride it out here?

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:45.882
He'll kill her if she runs.

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:50.386
She'll burn if she stays.

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:58.400
You go out there,
won't they come after all of us?

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.248
Oh, dear God.

01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:15.446
Eben.

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:23.486
Eben!

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:29.566
Eben.

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.697
Jake...

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:36.138
...when they're all watching me,
get on the walkie-talkie...

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:42.579
...and tell Stella to run for it.
- What are you talking about?

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.680
Eben.

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:55.186
When John Riis and Carter changed,
they were only bitten.

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:57.864
They stayed who they were
for a little while.

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:03.267
We can't fight them
the way that we are.

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:10.033
Thanks, little brother.

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.481
Take care of Stella for me.

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:23.982
- Are you fucking crazy?
- It's somebody else's blood.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:50.644
- He's one of them.
- How do we know he won't attack us?

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:54.312
- Maybe we should stop him now.
- Shut up.

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:55.852
Shut up!

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.460
Nobody touches him.

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:08.096
I can smell your blood.

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:31.282
You can't fight them all, Eben.

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:17.800
Stella, it's Jake.

01:41:18.972 --> 01:41:20.963
Get out of there now. Run.

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:29.308
The one who fights.

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.127
Go!

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:32.330
What did you do to yourself?

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:35.659
What I had to.

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.806
Should I go after them?

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:52.043
- It's almost dawn. We made it.
- Eben.

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:54.315
The dawn.
