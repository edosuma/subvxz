We can map it on your phone.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.693
Okay.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.456
(LAUGHS)

32:03.672 --> 32:05.208
What?

32:06.801 --> 32:09.759
I was just noticing
that you have the most incredible skin.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.260
It's flawless.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.057
That's a new one on me.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.844
Do you mind?

32:24.235 --> 32:25.350
(THUD)

32:25.569 --> 32:27.855
Oh. Sorry.

32:33.744 --> 32:36.201
- (CRASH)
- Oh!

32:38.958 --> 32:42.997
Oh, are you kidding me? Stiles!

32:46.298 --> 32:48.163
- Mrs. McCall?
- Yes!

32:48.384 --> 32:51.876
Wow, this is... This is just crazy.
What a coincidence, huh?

32:52.096 --> 32:53.711
(MELISSA LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

32:53.931 --> 32:56.092
Nicely done, Scott.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.801
"Nicely done."

33:08.112 --> 33:10.819
I mean... I do not know what happened.
You guys just came out of nowhere.

33:11.031 --> 33:14.239
Came out of nowhere! We were parked
on the side of the road, Stiles.

33:14.452 --> 33:15.862
How crazy is that?

33:16.078 --> 33:18.615
I mean, we should probably call the cops,
you know, do like an accident report thing.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.447
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Are you sure?

33:21.667 --> 33:24.579
- I think I'm feeling a little whiplash.
- Whiplash? You hit us!

33:24.795 --> 33:27.332
I don't know, there's
something definitely wrong with my neck.

33:27.548 --> 33:30.585
I know you're there, Scott,
and I'm impressed.

33:30.801 --> 33:34.089
It's too bad most teenagers
aren't that smart.

33:34.263 --> 33:38.302
"It's like that one on the lacrosse team...
Jackson."

33:38.517 --> 33:40.974
"Thinks he knows all about us."

33:41.187 --> 33:43.929
"You know how they say
knowledge is power."

33:44.148 --> 33:46.104
"Not in his case."

33:47.818 --> 33:50.275
Jackson. Oh, no.

34:04.335 --> 34:05.996
This is it?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.537
This is the place?

34:10.716 --> 34:12.422
Go ahead.

34:20.518 --> 34:23.976
Is it safe?
I don't want rafters falling on my head.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.769
Go in.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.202
(WOOD CREAKS)

35:06.522 --> 35:08.137
What's in here?

35:08.941 --> 35:10.522
Everything you want.

35:28.836 --> 35:31.919
(HINGES CREAK)

35:36.427 --> 35:39.669
It's gonna be all right. Trust me.

35:48.272 --> 35:52.106
JACKSON: This house...
It's the same house.

35:53.027 --> 35:54.483
What'd you say?

35:54.695 --> 35:57.311
I've dreamt about this place.

35:58.574 --> 36:01.361
I remember the staircase.
I remember these... These walls.

36:01.577 --> 36:04.034
I remember everything.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.116
You've been here?

36:10.628 --> 36:13.085
No, never. I dreamt it.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.748
There's no one else here.

36:20.638 --> 36:22.469
And no one else coming?

36:26.602 --> 36:27.887
(WHIMPERING)

36:28.103 --> 36:30.219
No... No, please...

36:30.397 --> 36:32.774
Please don't, okay? I'll shut up.
I'll never say another word again.

36:32.983 --> 36:34.018
I'll leave Scott alone.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.188
Please, you can't do this! Please!

36:38.739 --> 36:40.400
(SOBBING) I...

36:40.616 --> 36:43.232
- I don't deserve it.
- I think you do.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.943
- No!
- Look around you!

36:46.664 --> 36:49.451
Wouldn't there be
someone here trying to save you?

36:49.667 --> 36:51.999
There's no one here.

36:52.920 --> 36:56.959
And there's a reason. No one cares that
you drive an expensive car.

36:57.174 --> 36:59.130
No one cares that you have perfect hair,

36:59.343 --> 37:04.007
and no one cares
that you're captain of the lacrosse team!

37:04.223 --> 37:06.384
Excuse me.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.012
Co-captain.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.648
(GROWLING)

37:19.822 --> 37:21.153
- Move!
- No.

37:21.365 --> 37:23.697
Fine. I'll kill you, too.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.069
- (WHISTLING SOUND)
- Cover your eyes!

37:25.285 --> 37:27.071
(PINGING)

37:28.038 --> 37:30.324
(GLASS SHATTERING)

37:31.625 --> 37:34.082
(RAPID GUNFIRE)

37:40.926 --> 37:42.962
Scott! Go!

37:45.013 --> 37:47.470
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

37:50.018 --> 37:51.633
Run!

37:59.862 --> 38:01.068
(ROARS)

38:10.038 --> 38:12.495
(ELECTRONIC CHIME)

38:21.091 --> 38:22.956

38:23.177 --> 38:25.463
(WHEEZING)

38:34.605 --> 38:36.891
(GULPING)

38:40.444 --> 38:42.355
Allison.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.746
Stop.

38:58.962 --> 39:02.955
MAN: It's all right, Scott.
You're gonna be all right.

39:16.146 --> 39:17.181
(GASPS)

39:17.397 --> 39:18.557
(COUGHING)

39:18.774 --> 39:21.356
I wouldn't get up just yet.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.643
- Am I...
- You're fine.

39:24.863 --> 39:29.857
And I've given you something
that should speed up the healing process.

39:34.665 --> 39:36.496
But you're a vet.

39:36.834 --> 39:39.246
That's very true.

39:39.461 --> 39:44.000
And 90 percent of the time,
I'm mostly treating cats and dogs.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.081
Mostly?

39:47.970 --> 39:49.676
Mostly.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.769
What is this place?

40:04.027 --> 40:05.642
Let's start with the basics.

40:05.863 --> 40:09.481
You know how every family
has its secrets?

40:09.741 --> 40:12.118
Ours are a little different.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.163
(DOOR THUDS)

40:19.459 --> 40:21.541
("WHO ARE YOU, REALLY?" PLAYING)

40:21.753 --> 40:24.711
So you feel entitled to a sense of control

40:24.923 --> 40:27.255
And make decisions
that you think are your own

40:27.467 --> 40:29.674
You are a stranger here
Why have you come?

40:29.887 --> 40:31.002
Why have you come?

40:31.221 --> 40:33.553
Lift me higher
Let me look at the sun

40:33.724 --> 40:34.713
Look at the sun

40:34.933 --> 40:37.174
And once I hear them clearly say

40:37.394 --> 40:41.182
Who? Who are you, really?

40:42.065 --> 40:46.650
And where are you going?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.739
Well, I've got nothing left to prove

40:49.948 --> 40:52.234
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose

40:52.451 --> 40:54.692
See me bare my teeth for you

40:54.912 --> 40:58.871
Who? Who are you?

41:01.543 --> 41:03.044
(GROWLING)

41:03.629 --> 41:04.835
(GASPS)

41:06.006 --> 41:08.543
Isn't he beautiful?

41:09.092 --> 41:11.344
(ROARING)
