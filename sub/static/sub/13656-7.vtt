You got a pretty nice setup here Rusty.

00:02.329 --> 00:06.655
- You got your own room, a table, DVR.
- It's not my room.

00:06.656 --> 00:08.141
I wouldn't mind living here myself.

00:08.143 --> 00:10.498
The lab found a familial match to the boy,

Daniel Dunn, who I bet will test out

00:12.764 --> 00:14.498
as Rusty's biological father.

00:14.533 --> 00:17.599
Do you want me to meet him, so, like... 

00:17.633 --> 00:21.066
like I could leave here and live with him?

00:21.100 --> 00:22.635
Meeting your biological father... 

00:22.669 --> 00:23.806
it's entirely up to you.

00:23.841 --> 00:25.748
Well, then, I don't want to.

00:25.783 --> 00:28.785

02:43.585 --> 02:45.520
I don't want to criticize
Hollywood division,

02:45.554 --> 02:47.289
but why did they leave the victim

02:47.323 --> 02:48.623
to go to his upstairs bathroom?

02:48.658 --> 02:50.392
Because a neighbor saw a young girl

02:50.460 --> 02:51.994
jump out of that second-story window

02:52.028 --> 02:53.996
and called it in to Hollywood,

02:54.031 --> 02:55.765
which is how patrol came to
be there in the first place.

02:55.799 --> 02:57.333
Flynn: Okay.

02:57.368 --> 03:01.971
Officers arrived, found
Derek Hansen murdered,

03:02.006 --> 03:04.974
the bathroom door
locked, so they opened it.

03:05.009 --> 03:07.744
Hollywood figured the girl might
have hurt herself in the fall,

03:07.812 --> 03:09.579
so they tracked her down to an E.R.

03:09.613 --> 03:12.349
Treated and released to Sanchez,
who's bringing her here now.

03:12.383 --> 03:15.018
So far, she's not cooperating,
but that's to be expected.

03:15.053 --> 03:16.453
Because she's a suspect?

03:16.488 --> 03:18.755
Because she's a hooker.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.023
Tao: And this is her.

03:20.058 --> 03:22.693
She goes by "Little Elena" online.

03:22.727 --> 03:24.895
Girls this young are
usually controlled by a pimp.

03:24.929 --> 03:26.363
Flynn: Hollywood's treating it

03:26.398 --> 03:27.966
like your basic "pimp kills john" incident,

03:28.000 --> 03:29.768
so they wrapped the crime scene.

03:29.802 --> 03:31.470
Provenza: That was before they found out

03:31.504 --> 03:34.006
the victim was a politically
connected activist

03:34.040 --> 03:36.442
fighting to end sex trafficking of minors,

03:36.476 --> 03:40.013
and maybe... working with these young girls

03:40.047 --> 03:42.882
<i>just a little more closely
than he should have been.</i>

03:42.917 --> 03:44.852
Has the, uh, media gotten wind of this?

03:44.886 --> 03:47.688
No, but the politically
connected are already here,

03:47.723 --> 03:49.557
breathing down our necks.

03:49.591 --> 03:53.495
That's why I suggested we keep
working behind closed doors.

03:53.529 --> 03:54.763
Is that the official crime report?

03:54.797 --> 03:57.499
Yeah. Uh, here's what you need.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.701
The victim was found
sitting at his desk chair

03:59.735 --> 04:01.436
punched in the face, stabbed twice,

04:01.470 --> 04:03.805
throat cut, and, uh... 

04:03.873 --> 04:05.974
Oh, yeah. Look at these spatters, Mike.

04:06.042 --> 04:07.843
Interesting, huh?

04:07.877 --> 04:11.481
Hmm. This blood spurt
landed on top of the desk

04:11.548 --> 04:13.583
after it was ransacked.

04:13.617 --> 04:15.385
The pimp looked for the money first.

04:15.419 --> 04:17.988
Or, in addition to being a child molester,

04:18.055 --> 04:20.724
our victim was a big slob.

04:20.757 --> 04:22.626
More than that, we do not know

04:22.661 --> 04:24.828
because his computer and
cellphone are missing.

04:24.896 --> 04:27.832
So a public figure working with politicians

04:27.899 --> 04:32.336
and an outspoken activist
against underage prostitution... 

04:32.404 --> 04:34.905
I guess that would allow
him to contact minors

04:34.939 --> 04:37.941
without drawing the wrong
kind of attention to himself,

04:37.976 --> 04:40.477
but do we have anything that suggests

04:40.511 --> 04:43.447
that he could have been
trying to help the girl?

04:43.481 --> 04:45.015
She locked herself into the bathroom,

04:45.050 --> 04:47.017
which is where she would
have gone to call her pimp

04:47.085 --> 04:48.051
before rendering services.

04:48.086 --> 04:49.620
Or text him for help.

04:49.654 --> 04:52.356
Tao: This victim has multiple stab wounds.

04:52.424 --> 04:53.757
That's rather pimp-esque.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.826
If the girl gives up the guy who runs her,

04:55.860 --> 04:57.861
- maybe we can make him for the murder.
- Flynn: Good luck with that.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.131
Most of these girls think
their pimp's their boyfriend.

05:00.165 --> 05:02.666
Did Elena have a cellphone
when they picked her up?

05:02.701 --> 05:04.835
No, no, no. At the first sign of trouble,

05:04.870 --> 05:07.672
the girls know to dump everything
leading back to their pimps.

Captain Raydor, Lieutenant Provenza.

05:17.905 --> 05:20.474
This is State Senator Mac Austin

05:20.508 --> 05:22.910
and his Chief of Staff, John Jacob Felton.

05:22.944 --> 05:25.446
They worked with our victim on a bill

05:25.480 --> 05:28.583
that would add funds to
California police departments.

05:28.617 --> 05:30.885
Derek wanted millions of extra dollars

05:30.920 --> 05:32.554
training law-enforcement agencies

05:32.588 --> 05:33.622
about human trafficking.

05:33.656 --> 05:34.623
Millions?

05:34.657 --> 05:36.725
Yes. Millions.

05:36.759 --> 05:38.727
Austin: Difficult to get committee approval

05:38.761 --> 05:40.929
on Derek's entire wish
list, but by pairing up money

05:40.963 --> 05:43.865
for police departments with Shannon House,

05:43.932 --> 05:46.601
I hope to keep his foundation going.

05:46.635 --> 05:48.002
Senator, the details of this murder

05:48.037 --> 05:50.004
have not yet even been
released to the press.

05:50.039 --> 05:52.040
How did you know about Derek's death?

05:52.074 --> 05:53.574
There was no message,

05:53.609 --> 05:55.676
but I'm afraid his last
call was to my cell.

05:55.711 --> 05:57.811
The police didn't know it was my number,

05:57.846 --> 05:59.613
but when they checked it out,

05:59.648 --> 06:03.484
procedure may not have
been followed exactly.

06:03.518 --> 06:05.652
But, um, Derek and I were very close.

06:05.687 --> 06:06.887
Professionally. Not personally.

06:06.955 --> 06:08.488
Sanchez: Excuse me, ma'am,

06:08.523 --> 06:09.924
I've got the girl who calls herself Elena

06:09.958 --> 06:11.692
- in interview room 1.
- All right.

06:11.726 --> 06:13.527
Would that be the young lady
who jumped out of Derek's house?

06:13.561 --> 06:15.529
She could be, but we don't want anyone

06:15.563 --> 06:17.097
to know she was at the crime scene,

06:17.132 --> 06:18.465
so keep that quiet.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.167
We can't have special treatment here,

06:20.201 --> 06:22.703
so if you need to release
that information... 

06:22.737 --> 06:24.571
No, no, no, no.

06:24.606 --> 06:26.506
We don't want the murderer to
know that we have a witness.

06:26.540 --> 06:30.677
Julio, is there anything else?

06:32.480 --> 06:35.082
Well, uh, Elena only speaks Spanish.

06:35.116 --> 06:36.583
So she might've heard a fight,

06:36.617 --> 06:38.484
but she probably didn't understand it.

06:38.519 --> 06:41.053
And she insists she was locked
in the bathroom the whole time,

06:41.088 --> 06:42.488
so she didn't see anything.

06:42.522 --> 06:44.056
Did she mention her pimp?

06:44.090 --> 06:45.925
No, ma'am, but Hollywood's
bringing him over right now.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.027
So the pimp's already under arrest,

06:48.062 --> 06:49.696
and the girl is cooperating?

06:49.730 --> 06:51.164
Oh, not a chance, sir,

06:51.198 --> 06:54.000
but Elena's name came up on three F.I.S.

06:54.035 --> 06:55.936
F... F.I.S?

06:56.003 --> 06:57.671
Uh, yeah.

06:57.705 --> 07:00.741
When a patrol officer
talks to a suspicious type,

07:00.775 --> 07:03.110

07:03.145 --> 07:04.512
like these... F.I.S.

07:04.546 --> 07:05.913
Let's see.

07:05.948 --> 07:10.786
Elena was stopped on three
separate occasions by the L.A.P.D.

07:10.820 --> 07:13.889
And always in the company
of her pimp, Charles Alvarez.

07:13.923 --> 07:17.025
So Mr. Alvarez is currently on probation,

07:17.060 --> 07:19.628
but what's this little circle
with the dot in the center?

07:19.695 --> 07:20.962
Does that mean he's a target?

07:20.997 --> 07:22.230
Provenza: Uh, no.

07:22.265 --> 07:24.600
The circle with the dot in the center

07:24.634 --> 07:26.768
means that in the professional opinion

07:26.802 --> 07:29.704
of the officer conducting the interview,

07:29.739 --> 07:31.639
Mr. Alvarez was an asshole.

07:33.809 --> 07:37.512
Well, too bad that's not a crime, isn't it?

07:37.547 --> 07:39.214
I'll be needing your professional opinion

07:39.248 --> 07:41.483
quite a lot over the next few days

07:41.517 --> 07:43.618
because if you discover that Derek

07:43.653 --> 07:45.787
had this girl in his house
for the wrong reasons,

07:45.821 --> 07:47.055
well, the sooner I know that, the better,

07:47.089 --> 07:48.756
which is why I'd like to leave John here

07:48.791 --> 07:49.991
to monitor your progress.

07:50.059 --> 07:52.160
Sir, you have a speech at 1100 hours

07:52.228 --> 07:54.729
- that I think you should...
- I've made speeches long before I met you, John.

07:54.763 --> 07:55.997
This is more important.

07:56.032 --> 07:58.100
If Chief Taylor has no objections... 

08:00.637 --> 08:03.639
No. No, John, of course. Observe.

08:03.674 --> 08:05.675
Thank you.

08:05.743 --> 08:08.578

Damn it!

08:44.114 --> 08:45.648
Wow. Such language.

08:45.683 --> 08:47.016
Shocking, I know.

08:47.051 --> 08:49.686
It seems that the captain
has suddenly become

08:49.720 --> 08:51.621
very frustrated with the system.

08:51.655 --> 08:54.290
Well, boys, you're about to hear something

08:54.325 --> 08:57.026
that I thought would
never come out of my mouth.

08:57.061 --> 08:59.228
Mike, call the D.A.'s office.

08:59.262 --> 09:02.131
Get Hobbs over here.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.567
I think we might just need a snake wrangler

09:04.635 --> 09:08.037
to help us with all of
our new political friends.

09:08.071 --> 09:09.739
You can take this desk.

09:09.807 --> 09:12.041
The detective who normally sits here

09:12.076 --> 09:14.977

09:15.012 --> 09:17.246
Oh, but are you gonna talk to the girl now?

09:17.314 --> 09:20.049
Chief Taylor said something
about my listening in.

09:20.083 --> 09:23.252
Yes, Mr. Felton, we are
about to interview Elena.

09:23.286 --> 09:24.987
And I'd like to remind you

09:25.021 --> 09:28.324
of the confidential nature
of a murder investigation.

09:28.358 --> 09:29.558
Of course, Captain.

09:29.593 --> 09:31.260
I only report to the Senator,

09:31.328 --> 09:33.229
and that's to keep him
from being blindsided.

09:33.263 --> 09:36.665
Oh, John Jacob. Did they find the girl yet?

09:36.700 --> 09:38.367
The one from Derek's house?

09:38.402 --> 09:40.069
Excuse me. Who are you?

09:40.103 --> 09:42.772
Marisol Pena. I worked with Derek.

09:42.806 --> 09:45.007
I've been worried that whoever killed him

09:45.042 --> 09:46.909
might have murdered the girl, too.

09:46.943 --> 09:50.880
I thought you only reported to the senator.

09:50.914 --> 09:52.114
[Clears throat] I'm so sorry.

09:52.182 --> 09:53.883
Uh, h... he felt Marisol might be able

09:53.917 --> 09:55.918
to help figure out what happened.

09:55.953 --> 09:58.253
She's the executive
director of Shannon House.

09:58.288 --> 10:01.189
Oh, well, then perhaps you
can tell me if it was normal

10:01.224 --> 10:04.359
for Derek to have an underage prostitute

10:04.393 --> 10:06.094
in his own home.

10:06.129 --> 10:09.097
I know how it must look to you,
but Derek passed his card out

10:09.132 --> 10:11.800
to any young girl he
thought was being trafficked.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.735
I told him that one day,

10:13.770 --> 10:15.604
one of these pimps was gonna take him out.

10:15.638 --> 10:17.172
[Voice breaking] I told him.

10:17.207 --> 10:18.907
We already have the pimp in our custody.

10:18.942 --> 10:21.143
Well, he'll assume that she turned him in.

10:21.177 --> 10:24.180
The girl... she's not gonna talk to you.

10:24.214 --> 10:26.282
Look, let me help you.

10:26.316 --> 10:28.183
I walked the streets for 15 years.

10:28.218 --> 10:32.054
There is a very narrow window of
opportunity to gain this girl's trust.

10:32.088 --> 10:33.956
Working with teenagers who
have been sexually abused... 

10:33.990 --> 10:38.327
It's complicated, and the slightest mistake

10:38.361 --> 10:40.229
can drive them back out onto the street,

10:40.263 --> 10:42.631
where most of them die.

10:42.665 --> 10:46.802
Derek was murdered trying
to save this girl's life.

10:46.836 --> 10:49.304
Please. Let me help you.

10:49.338 --> 10:52.240
P... please don't waste his sacrifice.

10:55.011 --> 10:57.979
I will be mindful of your concerns,

10:58.013 --> 11:02.751
but first, you need to be mindful of mine.

11:05.921 --> 11:07.822
Elena.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.127
[Speaking Spanish]

11:12.161 --> 11:15.965
"This man... he was a
friend of yours, wasn't he?"

11:15.999 --> 11:18.234
[Speaking Spanish]

11:18.268 --> 11:20.369
"He was murdered yesterday."

11:20.403 --> 11:24.039
"We know you jumped out his window."

11:24.074 --> 11:25.074
"Maybe you killed him."

11:25.108 --> 11:26.242
That's ridiculous. Shh!

11:26.276 --> 11:27.443
"No, no, no. I didn't."

11:27.477 --> 11:29.445
Ms. Pena, she needs to talk,

11:29.479 --> 11:31.848
and you need to keep quiet, please.

11:31.882 --> 11:33.182
[Speaking Spanish]

11:33.216 --> 11:34.750
[Speaking Spanish]

11:42.359 --> 11:44.394
"C. A."?

11:45.529 --> 11:47.163
Charles Alvarez.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.102
[Speaking Spanish]

11:52.136 --> 11:53.436
"You make money for him, right?"

12:01.245 --> 12:02.478
"He's your cousin."

12:04.414 --> 12:08.084
Charles Alvarez has already
asked for a public defender?

12:08.152 --> 12:09.318
Hey, pimps know the drill.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.786
He's not gonna say anything,

12:10.821 --> 12:12.221
his girl's not gonna say anything,

12:12.256 --> 12:13.990
and they'll both be back on the street

12:14.024 --> 12:15.524
by tomorrow morning.

12:15.559 --> 12:17.760
Cynthia: Captain Raydor.
Just who I was looking for.

12:17.794 --> 12:19.528
Cynthia. Good news.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.297
Sharon Raydor,

12:21.331 --> 12:25.334
this is Daniel Dunn, Rusty's father.

12:25.368 --> 12:27.236
Captain, it's nice to meet you.

12:30.039 --> 12:31.941
And you... Mr. Dunn.

12:31.975 --> 12:33.242
Call me Daniel.

12:33.276 --> 12:34.476
[Clicks tongue]

12:42.200 --> 12:43.378
Rusty was very clear,

12:43.379 --> 12:47.253
he did not want to meet
his biological father.

12:47.287 --> 12:48.988
I mean, the kid's just now settling down.

12:49.055 --> 12:51.190
Foster care is, by definition, temporary.

12:51.224 --> 12:54.093
As it is, officially,
Rusty has a placement issue

12:54.127 --> 12:56.561
to which this man could be the answer.

12:56.596 --> 12:58.631
At the moment, he's more of a question.

12:58.665 --> 13:01.634
<i>Yeah, like why'd he just
show up now after 16 years?</i>

13:01.668 --> 13:04.637
Because you people gave
us DNA results last week

13:04.671 --> 13:06.739
and told us to go look for him.

13:06.773 --> 13:10.276
And once we found Mr. Dunn,
we were legally obligated

13:10.310 --> 13:12.945
to notify him of Rusty's existence.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.748
And in all 50 states,
we would've had to try

13:15.783 --> 13:18.652
to reunite him with a
parent or the nearest... 

13:21.589 --> 13:23.857
Hey. What's up?

13:23.925 --> 13:25.826
Nothing.

13:25.860 --> 13:28.228
Um, why aren't you in school?

13:28.263 --> 13:29.830
Uh, faculty retreat.

13:29.864 --> 13:31.232
They let us go right after mass.

13:31.266 --> 13:33.134
Gotta love those Catholics, right?

13:33.168 --> 13:34.168
[Chuckles nervously]

13:36.238 --> 13:37.638
Am I in trouble again?

13:37.673 --> 13:38.940
Oh, no, no, no. What do you need?

13:38.975 --> 13:42.210
Uh, a soda?

13:42.278 --> 13:44.212
Um, we have a sensitive family thing

13:44.280 --> 13:46.715
going on right now in the break room, so... 

13:46.749 --> 13:48.283
I'll bring you a soda in a minute.

13:48.317 --> 13:50.685
Great. Okay.

13:52.021 --> 13:53.989
- Uh, bye, Cynthia.
- Bye, Rusty.

13:58.895 --> 14:00.896
Let me give you the headline here.

14:00.963 --> 14:04.700
Unless he proves unfit, Mr.
Dunn has parental rights.

14:04.734 --> 14:07.269
<i>If he turns out to be Rusty's father.</i>

14:07.304 --> 14:11.808
- Lieutenant, Mr. Dunn's DNA has
already shown a connection...
- No, no, no.

14:11.842 --> 14:13.710
<i>Mr. Dunn's brother's DNA</i>

14:13.744 --> 14:16.879
has proven to be a near-match for Rusty.

14:16.914 --> 14:18.581
Near-match.

14:18.615 --> 14:19.816
I mean, what if there's
another brother out there?

14:19.850 --> 14:21.351
[Scoffs]

14:21.385 --> 14:23.653
You are a person we shouldn't
have to tell this to.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.021
Families keep secrets.

14:25.056 --> 14:27.725
Lieutenant, would you
meet and greet our pimp?

14:27.759 --> 14:30.260
And please ask Lieutenant
Tao to bring me a kit.

14:30.295 --> 14:32.896
Sure.

14:34.766 --> 14:38.602
Anyway, uh, real estate
is maybe coming back,

14:38.637 --> 14:40.871
which is good because I've got
a few properties in orange county

14:40.906 --> 14:42.873
that, uh, hopefully I can turn around

14:42.907 --> 14:44.207
for a nice chunk of change.

14:44.242 --> 14:46.143
So, you know, good... good savings.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.377
Good, uh, good prospects.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.179
And how is your brother doing?

14:49.214 --> 14:51.682
Well, he's in prison.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.784
So, not great.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.752
Have any other male siblings?

14:55.787 --> 14:58.856
No, no. I have a sister. Does she count?

14:58.890 --> 15:01.358
And did you all grow
up near the Beck family?

15:01.393 --> 15:06.397
Uh, well, um, Rusty's mother,

15:06.431 --> 15:08.666
uh, Sharon, you know,

15:08.700 --> 15:10.401
she was only around for the first half

15:10.435 --> 15:12.136
of my junior year of high school.

15:12.171 --> 15:14.806
I forget what her dad did, but
they moved away that winter.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.175
So is it even possible
you got her pregnant?

15:17.209 --> 15:19.010
Oh, yeah.

15:19.045 --> 15:21.913
It's, uh, it's very possible.

15:21.947 --> 15:23.214
[Chuckles]

15:23.248 --> 15:25.383
But I didn't know that.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.952
So after she left town, you
never heard from her again... 

15:27.987 --> 15:30.722
a postcard or phone call
saying you had a son?

15:30.756 --> 15:32.090
No. No, no.

15:32.124 --> 15:33.725
This... it's not something
that I like to say,

15:33.759 --> 15:37.429
but, you know, Sharon was... very social.

15:37.463 --> 15:40.399
I doubt she knew whose kid it was.

15:40.433 --> 15:44.102
Look [Chuckles] why the third degree?

15:44.137 --> 15:46.405
Is the kid in some kind of trouble?

15:46.439 --> 15:47.739
Or is he in jail?

15:47.773 --> 15:50.775
No.

15:50.810 --> 15:52.978
Rusty's staying at a private home,

15:53.012 --> 15:55.947
and he is a material
witness in a murder trial,

15:55.982 --> 15:59.017
which makes him my professional concern.

15:59.085 --> 16:00.018
I see.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.953
Does he know about me?

16:01.988 --> 16:03.355
Yes.

16:03.389 --> 16:05.892
And does he want to see me?

16:05.926 --> 16:07.326
At the moment, no.

16:07.361 --> 16:13.934
Oh. Okay. So how do we handle that?

16:13.969 --> 16:17.872
Uh, well, I could try to
persuade him to change his mind,

16:17.906 --> 16:19.374
but while I'm doing that,

16:19.408 --> 16:22.343
we should legally establish
your parental rights.

16:22.378 --> 16:24.178
Hi.

16:24.213 --> 16:26.948
I just need to take a quick
swab inside your cheek, okay?

16:26.982 --> 16:28.349
[Sighs]

16:28.384 --> 16:32.086
Okay. Um, does it hurt?

16:32.121 --> 16:34.989
Not usually. No.

16:38.326 --> 16:39.493
Say "ahh."

16:39.528 --> 16:43.497
Ahhh.

16:43.532 --> 16:45.232
Just checking to see if you're human.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.868
How did Mr. Alvarez violate
his probation, exactly?

16:47.903 --> 16:50.404
We found this folding knife in his pocket

16:50.472 --> 16:52.006
when we picked him up.

16:52.041 --> 16:55.710
So, Charlie, tell me.

16:55.744 --> 16:57.812
You know this guy?

17:00.549 --> 17:02.884
<i>Hey. Sit up straight and talk to me.</i>

17:02.918 --> 17:04.018
<i>I'm tired.</i>

17:04.051 --> 17:05.185
Yeah? Why's that?

17:05.220 --> 17:06.186
I work nights.

17:06.221 --> 17:07.821
So I heard.

17:07.856 --> 17:11.393
You stayed up late last
night to murder Derek Hansen.

17:11.426 --> 17:12.894
Murder?

17:12.928 --> 17:14.194
When? What's he... 

17:14.230 --> 17:18.165
Mr. Alvarez, don't
talk. It's not that hard.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.868
Lieutenant, you need probable
cause to hold him on a murder.

17:20.903 --> 17:23.438
[Chuckling] Oh, I've got more than cause.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.409
I've got one of Charlie's girls.

17:27.444 --> 17:28.510
Girls?

17:28.545 --> 17:30.179
What girls?

17:30.213 --> 17:32.214
He's a funny guy, this one, huh?

17:32.248 --> 17:33.916
Oh, yeah. I'm hilarious.

17:33.950 --> 17:37.786
Turns out, this girl was at
Derek Hansen's house last night

17:37.820 --> 17:39.288
when you beat him up and killed him.

17:39.322 --> 17:40.355
[Scoffs]

17:40.390 --> 17:43.225
Mr. Alvarez, show him your hands.

17:46.796 --> 17:48.464
<i>All right.</i>

17:48.498 --> 17:50.799
<i>Hold there.</i>

17:50.833 --> 17:52.534
[Door opens]

17:52.568 --> 17:54.136
How's it going?

17:54.203 --> 17:56.905
<i>You know how to work that thing?</i>

17:56.939 --> 17:59.074
<i>Oh, yeah. I know how to work it.</i>

17:59.108 --> 18:02.844
What'd you do with Rusty's father?

18:02.878 --> 18:04.079
He's in the break room,

18:04.113 --> 18:07.215
waiting for me to tell Rusty he's here.

18:07.249 --> 18:08.983
Kid deserves to know.

18:09.017 --> 18:10.551
It's not that simple.

18:10.585 --> 18:13.587
<i>Okay, so, Charlie,</i>

18:13.622 --> 18:15.489
we've got a witness,

18:15.524 --> 18:18.092
an underage girl you've
been selling in Hollywood.

18:18.126 --> 18:20.194
And she's been telling us all about you.

18:20.228 --> 18:21.461
Willis: How do we know you have a witness?

18:21.496 --> 18:23.530
Come on. Is this whole thing a fabrication?

18:23.565 --> 18:26.234
How do you think we found your idiot
client in the first place, Willis?

18:26.268 --> 18:27.502
The girl told us where to look.

18:27.536 --> 18:30.338
And listen to me... you be careful

18:30.406 --> 18:32.107
about who you accuse of fabrication.

18:32.141 --> 18:34.509
I don't make crap up... ever.

18:34.543 --> 18:36.244
Hobbs: His public defender knows

18:36.279 --> 18:38.414
you need the girl to
I.D. Alvarez as her pimp,

18:38.448 --> 18:40.249
or you have nothing but
the probation violation

18:40.283 --> 18:41.550
to hold him with.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.655
Lieutenant Flynn, I have an idea.

18:48.258 --> 18:50.193
I was making progress with
her. What are you doing?

18:50.260 --> 18:52.094
We just have a quick follow-up.

18:52.129 --> 18:53.929
Well, then, I'm going with her.

18:53.964 --> 18:55.431
That's not allowed, ma'am.

18:59.369 --> 19:01.337
Oops! Sorry. Wrong room.

19:01.371 --> 19:02.438
Willis: What is this?

19:02.472 --> 19:04.407
Alvarez: Hey, that's my cousin.

19:04.441 --> 19:05.441
What's up, cuz?

19:05.475 --> 19:06.875
Don't be mad, Chuckie.

19:07.944 --> 19:11.279
Well, what do you know?
Somebody speaks English.

19:11.313 --> 19:13.281
You're not telling the
truth, and you're a killer.

19:13.315 --> 19:15.516
Okay, sweetheart, you
tell him what you told us.

19:15.551 --> 19:17.518
Nothing! I told them nothing!

19:17.553 --> 19:19.287
Sit down, asshole.

19:19.321 --> 19:22.490
You heard what he said. Sit down.

19:22.525 --> 19:24.925
<i>Tao: You saw Chuckie murder Derek.</i>

19:24.960 --> 19:26.393
No! I... I heard an argument! That's all!

19:26.461 --> 19:28.162
I... I never said you
were there, Chuckie. Never.

19:28.196 --> 19:30.030
It's all good, baby girl.

19:30.064 --> 19:32.466
<i>It's all good.</i>

19:35.503 --> 19:37.170
You're dead!

19:37.204 --> 19:40.172
I will kill you! You are dead!

19:40.206 --> 19:42.207
It's over! You're done!

19:42.242 --> 19:45.444
<i>Now, that's what I call an identification.</i>

19:45.478 --> 19:47.346
Not to mention witness intimidation.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.181
We have him for a year now... at least.

19:49.215 --> 19:51.083
I'm coming for you, bitch!

19:51.117 --> 19:53.285
Did the suspect just break our door?

19:53.319 --> 19:55.687
<i>Flynn:... What you did to the door?</i>

19:55.721 --> 19:57.322
I think he did.

19:59.592 --> 20:01.159
Hold it there.

20:01.193 --> 20:02.694
Hollywood had to open Derek's bathroom door

20:02.728 --> 20:05.363
because it was locked when
they got there, correct?

20:05.398 --> 20:06.398
Right.

20:06.432 --> 20:08.066
And that's strange,

20:08.100 --> 20:09.601
because if Chuckie went
upstairs to get his girl back,

20:09.635 --> 20:11.236
he would have busted that door down.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.138
Like he did in the interview room.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.540
And he would have been
even more furious last night

20:15.575 --> 20:17.209
if he thought that Elena was there

20:17.243 --> 20:18.910
and was trying to run away from him.

20:18.944 --> 20:21.413
[Knocking on glass]

20:23.616 --> 20:26.551
I think the door tells us
Chuckie was never there.

20:26.586 --> 20:28.253
Lieutenant Provenza,
please tell Dr. Morales

20:28.288 --> 20:30.089
I want to see Derek Hansen's body.

20:30.123 --> 20:31.223
I'll do that, Captain.

20:33.293 --> 20:38.264
But before we go, I think
you have a notification to do.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.544
<i>What? You said it was up to me,</i>

20:52.579 --> 20:54.913
that meeting my father was up to me.

20:54.947 --> 20:57.082
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let
me tell you what happened here.

20:57.116 --> 20:59.484
- And he's in the building right now?!
- Just listen to me for a second.

20:59.518 --> 21:01.852
Do you not see how
screwed up this is, Sharon?

21:01.887 --> 21:03.454
Let me explain this to you.

21:03.488 --> 21:04.455
Oh, my God!

21:04.489 --> 21:06.156
Oh, my God!!

21:06.191 --> 21:07.458
Let me explain.

21:07.492 --> 21:09.359
When DCFS found out about Daniel Dunn,

21:09.394 --> 21:12.496
they became legally obligated
to tell him about you.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.197
So... so that's why Cynthia was here.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.632
Did she bring this guy with her?

21:15.666 --> 21:18.068
Is... is he in the break
room? He is, isn't he?

21:18.102 --> 21:19.903
He is in the break room,
and that is why you guys

21:19.938 --> 21:21.371
wouldn't let me in to get my soda,

21:21.406 --> 21:23.574
because I am the sensitive
family problem you have.

21:23.608 --> 21:26.010
Cynthia thought she was doing you a favor

21:26.044 --> 21:27.578
by bringing Mr. Dunn here.

21:27.613 --> 21:29.380
No! You stop it, Sharon! She
was doing a favor for you.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.983
<i>She was not doing a favor for me!</i>

21:32.017 --> 21:33.484
Great! The rules win!

21:33.519 --> 21:35.620
Now you can get rid of me,
and it's not your fault.

21:35.654 --> 21:38.990
- I am not trying to get...
- Okay. That's enough. That's enough!

21:39.025 --> 21:43.062
Now, you know that I am
not friends with this woman,

21:43.096 --> 21:44.930
but if she wanted to get rid of you,

21:44.965 --> 21:46.899
she could have dumped you
in a group home months ago.

21:46.933 --> 21:49.068
- It's all right, Lieutenant.
- No, it's not all right.

21:49.102 --> 21:50.336
<i>It's not all right.</i>

21:50.370 --> 21:51.570
So this guy shows up,

21:51.605 --> 21:54.407
says he's your father, wants to see you.

21:54.441 --> 21:55.941
Well, none of us like it.

21:56.009 --> 21:58.945
But instead of whining about the situation,

21:58.979 --> 22:01.247
let's look at our options.

22:01.281 --> 22:02.648
You talked to him?

22:04.451 --> 22:06.385
And what did you think?

22:09.056 --> 22:10.256
Rusty... 

22:10.290 --> 22:13.092
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

22:13.127 --> 22:15.428
Um, I can't say that I liked him.

22:15.463 --> 22:17.130
I don't know him.

22:17.165 --> 22:21.101
[Voice breaking] And,
uh, I can't be objective.

22:21.136 --> 22:24.138
He made an effort to come and see you,

22:24.172 --> 22:27.675
and I think just... think about that.

22:27.709 --> 22:29.443
- Sharon, I'm sorry.
- I know.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.711
Sharon, I'm sorry.

22:30.745 --> 22:32.546
I know. I know.

22:34.249 --> 22:37.951
Hope you're proud of yourself.

22:37.986 --> 22:39.219
Really classy,

22:39.253 --> 22:43.257
accusing her of wanting to get rid of you.

22:47.396 --> 22:49.731
Dr. Morales: First stab goes
straight through the heart... 

22:49.765 --> 22:51.466
right atrium, fatal.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.202
The second stab severed the renal artery.

22:54.236 --> 22:56.003
Mm. Kidneys.

22:56.038 --> 22:57.272
The blood supply to them, yes.

22:57.306 --> 22:58.739
Then we have the throat stab.

22:58.773 --> 23:02.610
Now, this blood spatter that
hit the papers on the desk?

23:02.644 --> 23:04.245
Very long and thin,

23:04.279 --> 23:05.746
suggesting it didn't
fall from a great height,

23:05.781 --> 23:09.484
meaning Mr. Hansen was
likely stabbed in the heart

23:09.518 --> 23:11.553
in position level with a desk,
which makes perfect sense.

23:11.587 --> 23:13.288
How so?

23:13.322 --> 23:16.124
Um, let... let me get
the right kind of chair.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.700
[Clears throat]

23:25.735 --> 23:31.306
I'm sorry... about Rusty, Captain, um... 

23:31.340 --> 23:33.475
you've got a tough
situation there, I guess.

23:33.509 --> 23:34.476
I do.

23:34.510 --> 23:36.711
[Inhales deeply]

23:36.746 --> 23:38.513
I can't tell him I want him to stay,

23:38.547 --> 23:39.781
because what if his father

23:39.816 --> 23:41.650
turns out to be a terrific human being?

23:41.684 --> 23:46.488
And, on the other hand, I
can't push him to see Mr. Dunn.

23:46.523 --> 23:51.027
It'd be like asking him
to leave, and if he goes... 

23:51.061 --> 23:54.297
Rusty comes with certain
challenges, and very frankly,

23:54.332 --> 23:58.168
I would like to be sure that
this guy is up to the job.

23:58.202 --> 24:02.071
And, also, why is Mr. Dunn
hanging around our break room

24:02.105 --> 24:04.206
when I very clearly explained to him

24:04.240 --> 24:05.507
that Rusty didn't want to see him?

24:09.245 --> 24:13.649
<i>But I can't ask him these things.</i>

24:13.683 --> 24:15.483
Oh, no.

24:15.518 --> 24:18.553
<i>But Rusty is a material
witness in a murder trial.</i>

24:18.588 --> 24:20.322
I think I should make sure

24:20.356 --> 24:23.358
that if he's going to be
outside of our jurisdiction,

24:23.392 --> 24:25.160
he is available to testify.

24:25.194 --> 24:27.262
That is our legal obligation.

24:27.296 --> 24:31.700
Maybe Mr. Dunn should just go away,

24:31.735 --> 24:33.369
come back another day.

24:33.403 --> 24:34.403
[Clattering]

24:34.438 --> 24:36.105
All right.

24:36.172 --> 24:42.078
So the victim was seated
during the entire attack.

24:42.112 --> 24:44.747
And, before any of these wounds occurred,

24:44.781 --> 24:46.281
his neck was broken.

24:46.316 --> 24:47.783
And because it's pretty important,

24:47.817 --> 24:49.451
I'd like to demonstrate how this happened.

24:49.485 --> 24:51.119
Lieutenant?

24:53.555 --> 24:56.124
For the record, I'm uncomfortable.

24:56.159 --> 24:59.194
The killer snaps the neck,
severing the spinal cord,

24:59.229 --> 25:00.696
interrupting signals to the brain.

25:00.731 --> 25:02.398
Panic never sets in,

25:02.432 --> 25:05.535
so no struggle while the
killer proceeds to stab,

25:05.569 --> 25:08.539
very methodically, here, then here,

25:08.573 --> 25:10.140
then stabs the throat.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.709
Very little blood produced,

25:11.743 --> 25:14.445
since the heart is no
longer pumping properly.

25:14.479 --> 25:17.314
Every wound fatal.

25:17.382 --> 25:20.217
So this was a professional hit?

25:20.251 --> 25:21.819
<i>Well, that's for you to decide,</i>

25:21.886 --> 25:23.853
but whoever killed this man

25:23.888 --> 25:25.822
avoided all the muss of a frontal assault

25:25.890 --> 25:27.724
and was thorough enough to
make sure the victim was dead

25:27.758 --> 25:28.859
several times over.

25:30.595 --> 25:32.896
Sound like hand-to-hand
combat to you, Lieutenant?

25:32.930 --> 25:35.899
Maybe we should ask a soldier.

25:35.933 --> 25:39.135
Hayes: If anyone in your deployment
uses prostitutes overseas,

25:39.169 --> 25:42.638
if he sexually abuses his
fellow female soldiers,

25:42.672 --> 25:46.709
then he could end up bringing
those bad habits back home.

25:46.744 --> 25:49.846
As officers, it's up to you
to let your soldiers know

25:49.881 --> 25:52.282
that, one, you will investigate

25:52.317 --> 25:54.718
all incidents of sexual misconduct

25:54.753 --> 25:56.520
and report up the chain of command.

25:56.554 --> 25:58.455
And two, you will ensure

25:58.490 --> 26:01.725
appropriate disciplinary action be taken

26:01.760 --> 26:03.594
by following up on all complaints.

26:03.628 --> 26:06.463
And that's it for the day. Dismissed.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.370
Excuse me. Lieutenant Angel Hayes?

26:13.404 --> 26:14.605
Yes.

26:14.639 --> 26:17.875
Lieutenants Tao and Flynn, L.A.P.D.

26:17.942 --> 26:19.943
Is this an okay time to
ask you a few questions?

26:19.978 --> 26:23.180
Absolutely. I hope I have answers.

26:23.214 --> 26:24.815
Do you know a man named Derek Hansen?

26:24.849 --> 26:26.951
Derek? Sure. He worked here.

26:26.985 --> 26:30.421
We still use his material
for our seminars. Why?

26:30.455 --> 26:31.956
Was he good at his job?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.758
<i>Uh, maybe a little too good.</i>

26:33.793 --> 26:34.826
What do you mean?

26:39.299 --> 26:40.632
Derek wanted to try out

26:40.667 --> 26:43.201
a whole new psych protocol on recruits,

26:43.236 --> 26:45.404
have us screen for sexual abusers.

26:45.471 --> 26:48.640
But that kind of test takes
years for the army to approve.

26:48.674 --> 26:52.310
So when we told Derek no,
he went over our heads.

26:52.345 --> 26:53.378
To whom?

26:53.413 --> 26:55.747
Secretary of the army.

26:55.814 --> 26:56.981
Ooh. Yeah.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.750
Not a good move.

26:59.818 --> 27:01.318
Look, I'm an M.P.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.420
I know you guys don't
ask questions for fun.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.888
What's going on?

27:04.923 --> 27:07.223
When was the last time
you saw or spoke to Derek?

27:07.258 --> 27:11.661
He called and asked me to
help him lobby a state senator

27:11.695 --> 27:12.662
to fund Shannon House.

27:12.696 --> 27:13.796
By doing what?

27:13.831 --> 27:15.531
Contacting some retired officer.

27:15.566 --> 27:17.800
Asked me to look up
the guy's service record

27:17.835 --> 27:18.968
so I'd know what to say.

27:19.002 --> 27:21.270
- And this was when?
- Last week.

27:21.304 --> 27:23.372
But Derek had some information wrong,

27:23.407 --> 27:25.575
so it took me a minute to figure it out.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.276
Did you give him the record?

27:27.311 --> 27:28.711
No. That's strictly confidential.

27:28.746 --> 27:30.413
I just corrected Derek's mistake.

27:30.447 --> 27:33.817
Then he said never mind the
call and that he'd sort it out.

27:33.851 --> 27:35.885
What kind of mistake we talking about?

27:35.920 --> 27:39.422
Derek said this man retired as a captain,

27:39.457 --> 27:43.293
but he actually received
an honorable discharge

27:43.328 --> 27:44.962
as a lieutenant.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.530
Um, here it is.

27:46.564 --> 27:49.666
Uh, does the name Lieutenant
John Jacob Felton ring a bell?

27:50.867 --> 27:52.835
Yes, ma'am. It does.

28:08.225 --> 28:11.094
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Dunn.

28:11.129 --> 28:12.996
I'm Lieutenant Provenza.

28:13.030 --> 28:15.932
We've, uh, got a lot
going on around here today.

28:15.966 --> 28:18.368
And the kid still hasn't made up his mind.

28:18.402 --> 28:22.205
So, you sure you want to wait?

28:22.240 --> 28:23.840
Yeah.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.342
Yeah, if there's a chance

28:25.376 --> 28:28.212
that he'd be willing to
sit with me for a minute,

28:28.246 --> 28:29.213
yeah, I'll wait.

28:29.248 --> 28:30.948
Is there a rush?

28:30.983 --> 28:32.350
Excuse me?

28:32.384 --> 28:34.986
I'm just saying that Rusty is,

28:35.054 --> 28:38.522
well, he's a little "if,
and, or" at the moment.

28:38.557 --> 28:40.124
He's had a rough life.

28:40.158 --> 28:41.459
His caseworker told me some of that.

28:41.493 --> 28:43.127
I know that he's had problems.

28:43.162 --> 28:45.997
And you're still pushing
hard to meet with him.

28:46.031 --> 28:49.568
I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.

28:54.508 --> 28:57.978
It's a pretty big shock to
find out that you have a kid.

28:58.012 --> 29:01.448
I haven't told anybody.

29:01.482 --> 29:03.884
To be honest, I'm engaged to
be married in a few months,

29:03.918 --> 29:05.452
and if we've got to start
out with a bigger family

29:05.486 --> 29:07.054
than we thought... 

29:07.088 --> 29:09.423
Wait. H... hold on a
second. "A bigger family"?

29:09.457 --> 29:13.860
Are you saying that your
wife-to-be already has children?

29:13.894 --> 29:16.396
Two girls... 3 and 5.

29:16.430 --> 29:17.630
I see.

29:17.665 --> 29:19.099
Yeah.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.334
So before I break this news to her,

29:21.369 --> 29:24.071
I'd like to find out a little bit more

29:24.105 --> 29:26.139
about what I should say.

29:26.174 --> 29:28.141
Explains a lot.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.646
Okay.

29:32.681 --> 29:35.049
I'll see what I can do.

29:37.453 --> 29:40.521
Taylor: You would think a
State Senator's Chief of Staff

29:40.556 --> 29:43.625
would know better than to
lie about his military record,

29:43.660 --> 29:46.161
but, my God, right on his résumé... 

29:46.196 --> 29:49.131
"John Jacob Felton,
retired captain, U.S. Army."

29:49.166 --> 29:51.034
That's what I call self-promotion.

29:51.068 --> 29:54.103
Veterans take a very dim
view of inflating rank,

29:54.138 --> 29:57.240
but for politicians, it's
completely unacceptable,

29:57.274 --> 29:59.042
and Derek... 

30:01.312 --> 30:04.314
Derek was prepared to
use this fraudulent résumé

30:04.348 --> 30:05.582
to blackmail Felton.

30:05.616 --> 30:07.150
For what?

30:07.185 --> 30:09.053
Tao: Here's the relevant
e-mail correspondence

30:09.087 --> 30:11.622
between John Jacob Felton and Derek Hansen.

30:11.657 --> 30:13.224
Felton writes to Derek,

30:13.258 --> 30:14.692
"there's a limit to
what we can do this year.

30:14.727 --> 30:16.327
The state budget deficit... "

30:16.361 --> 30:17.962
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

30:17.996 --> 30:20.331
"Under these circumstances,
you should consider

30:20.365 --> 30:22.366
getting half the usual
funding for Shannon House

30:22.401 --> 30:23.401
a great victory."

30:23.435 --> 30:25.069
"But the Senator wants to know

30:25.103 --> 30:27.238
you won't embarrass
him over this compromise,

30:27.272 --> 30:29.239
which is the best we can do right now."

30:29.274 --> 30:31.108
But Derek wasn't a compromiser.

30:31.143 --> 30:34.078
He knew that Felton was
ex-army, so he went to an officer

30:34.112 --> 30:36.380
that he thought might
help him twist an arm.

30:36.414 --> 30:38.349
Instead, she gave him
something even better.

30:38.383 --> 30:40.584
A fraudulent résumé that allowed Derek

30:40.619 --> 30:43.587
to threaten a Senator's
Chief of Staff with exposure

30:43.622 --> 30:46.757
unless Derek got full funding
for everything he wanted.

30:48.260 --> 30:52.096
And thanks to me, Felton
knows we have no evidence.

30:52.130 --> 30:53.130
[Glasses clatter]

30:53.165 --> 30:54.565
It's not all bad, chief.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.634
As far as he knows, we're
still pursuing the pimp.

30:56.668 --> 30:58.236
- He won't see us coming.
- All right.

30:58.270 --> 30:59.937
Let's talk about for a second

30:59.972 --> 31:02.374
because arresting Austin's
chief of staff for murder

31:02.408 --> 31:04.108
without being able to prove it

31:04.143 --> 31:07.078
ruins the senator's career
and doesn't help us, either.

31:07.112 --> 31:10.448
And we have no physical evidence
tying Felton to this crime.

31:10.482 --> 31:13.451
Well, actually, we do. We have a witness.

31:13.485 --> 31:15.252
We have Elena.

31:15.287 --> 31:18.122
You mean the girl who said
she didn't see anything.

31:18.156 --> 31:21.526
She also said she didn't speak
English, and then she did,

31:21.560 --> 31:25.530
so who knows what else we
could get her to remember?

31:26.732 --> 31:29.167
[Sighs deeply]

31:29.201 --> 31:31.736
Tell me something, Elena.
And this is off the record.

31:31.771 --> 31:35.273
<i>When you were at our victim
Derek's house last night,</i>

31:35.307 --> 31:37.075
<i>was he paying for your time?</i>

31:37.109 --> 31:38.310
<i>Elena: No.</i>

31:38.344 --> 31:41.980
He handed out his card to a
bunch of us at a diner one day,

31:42.014 --> 31:43.281
said he could help.

31:43.315 --> 31:44.682
<i>[Scoffs]</i>

31:44.717 --> 31:48.286
<i>We laughed, like, "right. Help how?"</i>

31:48.320 --> 31:50.154
<i>It couldn't change what we had done.</i>

31:50.189 --> 31:53.191
<i>And our parents wouldn't want us back.</i>

31:55.094 --> 31:56.594
<i>But I kept the card.</i>

31:56.629 --> 32:01.133
Uh, and I see these... these
girls in uniforms from a school,

32:01.167 --> 32:03.769
laughing and eating frozen yogurt.

32:03.803 --> 32:07.172
And I thought, "that used to be me."

32:07.206 --> 32:10.108
So I snuck off, walked to Derek's house.

32:10.143 --> 32:14.846
He was, uh, very nice.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.356
Oh! Buzz, what happened?

32:24.391 --> 32:27.393
I'm not sure. Maybe something got bumped.

32:27.427 --> 32:30.195
Lieutenant, we're having
technical difficulties.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.330
Hold the interview.

32:31.364 --> 32:33.365
I'll be right back.

32:33.399 --> 32:35.167
You're doing great, Elena.

32:37.236 --> 32:38.570
We're almost done, Elena.

32:38.638 --> 32:40.372
I don't ever have to
worry about Chuckie again?

32:40.406 --> 32:42.274
No. We've got him.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.276
The only thing that's left for us to do

32:44.310 --> 32:46.411
is to go over the rest of that little story

32:46.445 --> 32:47.545
we asked you to tell.

32:47.579 --> 32:49.347
And it... it doesn't matter

32:49.381 --> 32:52.083
if I never saw anybody
else in Derek's house?

32:52.117 --> 32:53.117
No.

32:53.152 --> 32:54.252
The only thing that matters

32:54.320 --> 32:56.721
is this guy believes you when you lie.

32:56.755 --> 32:58.089
Can you do that?

32:58.123 --> 32:59.390
[Chuckles]

32:59.424 --> 33:01.258
If I couldn't make men
believe me when I lied,

33:01.326 --> 33:03.560
Chuckie would've dumped me a long time ago.

33:08.199 --> 33:10.100
You know, John, since it seems

33:10.134 --> 33:12.168
like Derek died in the line of duty,

33:12.202 --> 33:14.437
maybe the Senator can
use what happened here

33:14.471 --> 33:15.638
to good effect.

33:15.673 --> 33:18.074
Rename the legislation for Derek.

33:18.108 --> 33:21.377
Hell, might even make it easier to pass.

33:21.412 --> 33:23.079
Well, to be honest, Chief,

33:23.113 --> 33:25.782
funding this bill has
been an uphill battle,

33:25.816 --> 33:31.688
but I will say if you're able to use
existing law to put away this pimp,

33:31.722 --> 33:36.092
it just might prove our present legal
structure is better than we assume.

33:36.127 --> 33:37.527
[Door opens]

33:37.561 --> 33:40.698
All fixed now. Should
be coming back online.

33:40.732 --> 33:42.333
[Door closes]

33:42.367 --> 33:43.734
[Sighs]

33:46.304 --> 33:49.606
<i>Okay, so you were looking out the window,</i>

33:49.641 --> 33:50.608
and you could see the street?

33:50.642 --> 33:51.809
Yes.

33:51.844 --> 33:54.346
I was... 

33:54.380 --> 33:56.448
I was so afraid Chuckie
might come and get me.

33:56.482 --> 34:00.218
So tell me, Elena,

34:00.252 --> 34:02.420
did you see who came to
Derek's house last night?

34:08.728 --> 34:14.431
<i>Yes. And I saw him go to
his car after the fight.</i>

34:14.467 --> 34:17.302
<i>And what kind of car was it?</i>

34:17.337 --> 34:19.705
<i>Uh, a blue BMW.</i>

34:19.739 --> 34:23.141
<i>Did you get a chance to
see what he looked like?</i>

34:23.176 --> 34:28.748
Um, kind of tall. Big, burly,
short hair... brownish-blond.

34:28.782 --> 34:30.516
<i>And he wore glasses.</i>

34:30.551 --> 34:33.186
<i>And he and Derek fought?
[Cellphone vibrates]</i>

34:33.219 --> 34:34.154
Yes.

34:34.188 --> 34:35.388
Did Derek say a name?

34:35.422 --> 34:37.357
<i>John. I heard him say John.</i>

34:37.391 --> 34:39.659
<i>Or Jacob. Maybe... maybe John Jacob?</i>

34:39.693 --> 34:42.328
You're not leaving, are you, John?

34:42.362 --> 34:44.329
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm getting a call.

34:44.364 --> 34:46.498
If it's the Senator,
you may want to tell him

34:46.532 --> 34:49.301
I'm very close to making an arrest.

34:53.371 --> 34:54.638
There some kind of problem?

34:54.672 --> 34:57.842
We were hoping you could tell us, Captain.

34:57.876 --> 34:59.543
Or is it Lieutenant?

34:59.578 --> 35:01.478
Your résumé says one thing,

35:01.513 --> 35:03.614
your military record says another.

35:03.648 --> 35:05.282
Hate to say it, John.

35:05.317 --> 35:08.286
You're burly, you wear
glasses, your hair is short,

35:08.320 --> 35:10.956
and you drove here today in a big blue BMW.

35:10.990 --> 35:12.490
[Scoffs]

35:12.525 --> 35:14.826
[Sighs]

35:17.863 --> 35:19.998
What are you... 

35:22.635 --> 35:25.637
what is it you think you're doing?

35:25.671 --> 35:29.240
I believe we're arresting you
for the murder of Derek Hansen.

35:29.274 --> 35:30.541
Before we go there, let
me read you your rights.

35:30.575 --> 35:32.809
Oh, I waive. Okay, I waive!

35:32.844 --> 35:34.711
This is ridiculous!

35:34.746 --> 35:38.649
I didn't kill Derek, okay?
Are you... are you serious?

35:38.683 --> 35:40.550
Excuse me, Mr. Felton.
Do you carry a knife?

35:40.585 --> 35:42.486
[Chuckles] On me? Of course not!

35:42.520 --> 35:44.555
Then you brought one with you last
night when you killed Derek Hansen.

35:44.589 --> 35:46.723
Which means you planned
the murder out, Lieutenant.

35:46.758 --> 35:48.859
Congratulations, Mr. Felton,

35:48.893 --> 35:51.027
you've just been promoted to murder one.

35:53.731 --> 35:57.667
You're gonna take the word of
a teenage hooker against mine?

35:57.702 --> 36:00.270
Come on, she probably killed
Derek for molesting her.

36:00.305 --> 36:01.905
I don't think she had the combat training

36:01.940 --> 36:04.308
to stab him twice, slit his
throat, and break his neck.

36:04.342 --> 36:08.546
But an ex-infantry officer
could do that very well.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.581
What happened, John?

36:10.615 --> 36:14.685
Did you lose it?

36:14.720 --> 36:18.556
Did Derek's blackmail attempt
make you snap, go crazy?

36:26.631 --> 36:29.300
Sanchez: DDA Hobbs, if you will... 

36:29.334 --> 36:31.002
Hobbs: I talked to my boss.

36:31.036 --> 36:32.737
We'll call it murder two.

36:32.771 --> 36:36.574
30 years. You will have a
date for a parole hearing.

36:36.608 --> 36:37.908
Yeah?

36:37.943 --> 36:40.845
And how many people convicted of murder two

36:40.879 --> 36:43.881
have been out in the last 20 years?

36:43.915 --> 36:45.916
Two, I think.

36:45.950 --> 36:47.984
But that's just because of the
current political atmosphere.

36:48.019 --> 36:49.853
Times change.

36:49.887 --> 36:52.321
I can either arrest you now... 

36:52.356 --> 36:54.924
murder one with special circumstances

36:54.958 --> 36:56.792
and you can explain yourself in open court

36:56.827 --> 36:59.729
while a jury decides whether or
not to put a needle in your arm...

36:59.763 --> 37:02.732
or I can call a lawyer,

37:02.767 --> 37:05.602
work with him on your statement of facts,

37:05.637 --> 37:07.738
and we can wrap this up today.

37:07.773 --> 37:10.775
Bear in mind, we now have an eyewitness.

37:15.414 --> 37:17.415
You can't scare me with murder one.

37:17.450 --> 37:20.084
Nobody's being executed
in this state anymore.

37:20.119 --> 37:21.552
That's true,

37:21.587 --> 37:23.921
but as Chief Taylor says, times change.

37:23.956 --> 37:26.023
Who knows what the political
atmosphere will be like

37:26.058 --> 37:28.392
after your 10th year on death row.

37:31.496 --> 37:33.763
So... 

37:33.798 --> 37:35.765
You agree, in advance,

37:35.800 --> 37:38.768
to a second-degree murder conviction?

37:38.803 --> 37:40.537
I do.

37:40.571 --> 37:43.606
And can I give you my written statement?

37:45.109 --> 37:47.377
Or do you need to hear me say

37:47.411 --> 37:49.946
how I killed the son of a bitch out loud?

37:49.980 --> 37:52.148
Just be thorough. I don't
want to miss a detail.

37:57.888 --> 37:59.856
Taylor: I'll give the Senator an update.

37:59.890 --> 38:04.894
He'll be relieved to know his activist
friend was completely innocent.

38:04.961 --> 38:06.862
And I can thank him for insisting

38:06.896 --> 38:09.531
on leaving the killer
here with us this morning.

38:09.566 --> 38:12.501
Saved us a little time.

38:15.638 --> 38:19.007
One deal done.

38:19.042 --> 38:21.843
And one to go.

38:34.993 --> 38:37.593
I think it says something
good about Daniel,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.528
that he waited around for 12 hours.

38:40.563 --> 38:43.364
Yeah, well, I waited for 16 years.

38:43.399 --> 38:48.002
And that's tough... 
but maybe not his fault.

38:48.036 --> 38:49.504
Look.

38:49.538 --> 38:52.407
What you do today is still your decision.

38:52.441 --> 38:55.243
But when the DNA comes back... 

38:55.278 --> 38:57.079
Oh, I know.

38:57.113 --> 38:58.647
I've been looking it up all
day long on the Internet... 

38:58.681 --> 39:01.450
that whole parental-rights thing.

39:01.484 --> 39:03.285
If he takes this to court, we're screwed.

39:03.319 --> 39:05.453
The law is on his side, so
don't say we have choices.

39:05.488 --> 39:08.189
We don't have choices... either of us.

39:08.224 --> 39:10.258
We can choose how we react.

39:10.292 --> 39:14.195
Yeah, but he won't like me, Sharon.

39:14.229 --> 39:17.264
He'll find out everything
about me, and I just... 

39:17.299 --> 39:19.200
I can't.

39:19.234 --> 39:22.036
It makes me feel like
I have to... to run away,

39:22.070 --> 39:25.139
t... to be somewhere else.

39:25.173 --> 39:26.640
You can't get to somewhere else

39:26.675 --> 39:28.476
because the thing that
you want to run away from,

39:28.510 --> 39:29.544
you take it with you.

39:31.481 --> 39:33.548
Where you go, it goes.

39:33.583 --> 39:35.350
So before you run away,

39:35.385 --> 39:41.056
why don't you give him a
really good look in the eye?

39:48.464 --> 39:52.367
I know I... I already said
that I was sorry for... 

39:52.401 --> 39:54.636
for saying that you
wanted to get rid of me.

39:54.670 --> 39:56.438
That was... that was terrible.

39:56.472 --> 39:59.408
And I don't... I don't really think that.

39:59.442 --> 40:04.446
I just... I feel like I
don't belong here sometimes,

40:04.480 --> 40:10.252
which is weird because you have
been nothing but good to me, Sharon.

40:10.287 --> 40:12.555
And I know that.

40:14.825 --> 40:16.225
I always know that.
