03:39.010 --> 03:43.174
- Hey!
- It's her. The Ridgeway girl.

03:43.306 --> 03:48.142
- Nice.
- Some of us have to work for a living.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.453
Daisy! Back into line.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.400
Welcome to Wade Hall, Miss Ridgeway.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.364
We all hope you will be very happy here.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.155
Thank you, Bamstaple. I know I shall.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.780
Perhaps you would care
to meet the staff, miss?

04:50.916 --> 04:55.501
Later. I want to see what progress
we've made with the grounds.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.540
The architect isn't here yet, miss.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.463
Now, Barnstaple.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.584
Very good, miss.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.889
<i>- Jackie!
- Linnet!</i>

05:13.021 --> 05:14.932
- Jackie!
- Oh, Linny!

05:16.775 --> 05:19.563
Oh, I'm sorry.
That fool of a butler didn't tell me.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.651
Oh, no, no. It's alright, it's alright.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.568
- You look marvellous.
- Thank you. So do you, as always.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.815
Where should I serve the tea,
mademoiselle?

05:26.952 --> 05:29.193
<i>- In the drawing room.
- Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

05:29.329 --> 05:32.867
- Let's go upstairs and freshen up.
- What's the matter with Louise?

05:32.999 --> 05:39.120
Man trouble, what else? She wants
to get married. To an Egyptian, no less.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.544
She knew absolutely nothing about him,
so I had him checked out.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.917
- And?
- He had a wife already.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.795
- So you put a stop to it.
- You bet I did.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.093
I told her she couldn't look to me
for a dowry,

05:50.225 --> 05:53.308
and naturally he wouldn't touch her
without one. Men!

05:54.604 --> 06:00.646
- Oh, Linnet! Oh! It's beautiful!
- I'm so glad you like it.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.111
Listen, Linnet. I've got something
to tell you, and a favour to ask.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.197
- Well, anything, you know that.
- No, no. This is serious.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.785
- I'm engaged.
- Jackie! Oh, that's wonderful!

06:11.913 --> 06:13.824
- Will you give him a job?
- A job?

06:13.957 --> 06:16.494
Here, at Wode Hall. Please.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.664
Don't you think you should tell me
something about him first?

06:19.796 --> 06:24.541
Well, his name is Simon,
Simon Doyle, and he's...

06:24.676 --> 06:27.634
Oh, he's everything
I've ever dreamed of.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.429
Jackie...

06:30.557 --> 06:32.594
- Isn't it lovely?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.093
- Yes, isn't it?
- The trouble is he's broke.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.187
- That makes two of us.
- These shoes are killing me.

06:39.316 --> 06:43.435
But he loves the country
and a job here would be just ideal.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.859
Oh, Linnet, I'll die if I can't marry
him. I really will, I'll just die.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.449
- You have got it badly.
- I know.

06:50.577 --> 06:55.196
- Alright. What do you want me to do?
- Well, you've got this huge place.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.869
You're going to need someone
to run it for you. Simon!

06:58.001 --> 07:00.493
- But I need someone with experience.
- No, listen!

07:00.629 --> 07:03.963
He studied Estate Management
at Cambridge. He's very bright.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.878
I'll tell you what.
If you don't like him, you can fire him.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.001
But you will, I know you will.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.720
Alright.
Why don't you bring him down tomorrow?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.510
- And I'll have a look at him.
- Thank you!

07:15.644 --> 07:17.601
- Jackie!
- Bye-bye!

07:23.151 --> 07:25.062
I just don't want to feel
a fool.

07:25.195 --> 07:29.735
Don't worry. Linnet promised.
Well, almost.

07:29.866 --> 07:35.361
- I think Linnet may not even like me.
- Nonsense. She'll adore you!

07:35.497 --> 07:38.205
And you're perfect for the job. Perfect.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.700
Well, I'll do my best
not to let you down.

07:40.835 --> 07:45.545
Oh, Simon, I do love you.
You make me so happy!

07:47.509 --> 07:51.173
- We'll honeymoon in Egypt.
- You always said we'd go to Egypt.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.360
Hello! Linnet!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.487
Oh, Linny. Here he is.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.081
- Come on.
- Hang on, darling.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.324
Here he is.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.285
My Simon.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.465
Hello.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.590
Jackie's told me so much about you.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.089
Isn't he perfect?
Isn't he, Linny?

08:39.519 --> 08:44.138
- Yes, I think he'll do very well.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.734
<i>I told you.</i>

09:02.834 --> 09:07.078
Linnet Ridgeway marries penniless
Prince Charming after whirlwind romance.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.296
They plan to honeymoon in Egypt.
Jesus H Christ!

09:10.425 --> 09:14.168
Don't you mean Tut N Khamun?
Well, what the hell do we do?

09:17.432 --> 09:20.766
The Bremen sails tonight.
I can just get on.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.056
What, and try fixing
those British lawyers?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.429
- No, you dope.
- Then what?

09:27.150 --> 09:30.188
I'll go to Egypt.
Hell, she's gonna be there for a month.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.358
"Why, Uncle Andrew!"

09:33.490 --> 09:36.107
A chance meeting.
I'm over there on a trip.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.200
Honeymoon lovers,
she's not thinking too clear.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.070
Get the picture?

09:41.206 --> 09:44.039
Look, Linnet's no fool, Pennington.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.876
Neither am I!

09:49.756 --> 09:55.672
Well, you have a nice trip,
wicked Uncle Andrew.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.930
So that's the Ridgeway girl.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.847
What are you studying so closely?

10:03.978 --> 10:07.187
Her picture? Or her pearls?

10:07.315 --> 10:12.435
Keep a civil tongue in your head,
Bowers, or you'll be out of a job.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.981
What do I care?

10:15.031 --> 10:17.944
This town is filled with
rich old widows

10:18.076 --> 10:20.909
willing to pay for a little
grovelling and a body massage.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.869
You go ahead and fire me.

10:22.997 --> 10:28.538
Temper, temper, Bowers!
It's obvious you need a holiday.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.419
How would a little trip
down the Nile suit you?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.293
There's nothing I would
dislike more.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.921
If there's two things in the world
I can't abide, it's heat and heathens.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.923
Good, then we'll go.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.845
Bowers, pack!

12:26.788 --> 12:29.405
Why don't they put
an escalator in these things?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.451
- Lazybones!
- Lazybones?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.747
Don't you know it's better
to travel hopefully than to arrive?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.709
What a view!

12:41.135 --> 12:43.467
- Happy, darling?
- Silly!

12:43.596 --> 12:47.305
- We must be the happiest people alive.
- And the prettiest.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.051
- And the luckiest.
- And the alonest.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.928
Just us and no one else.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.815
The Neter Menkaure pyramid
is 204 feet high.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.860
Each side of the base
is 356.5 feet.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.905
- Jackie!
- What the hell are you doing here?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.031
Seeing the sights,
like yourselves.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.785
But you were at the Danieli in Venice,
and at Brindisi too.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.082
- What a coincidence!
- Jackie, why?

13:21.217 --> 13:24.335
She's following us about
deliberately.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.258
Is that true?
Well, it's intolerable!

13:27.390 --> 13:30.928
And common. Very, very common.

13:31.060 --> 13:35.054
And effective. Very,
very effective.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.980
Bye-bye.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.898
- Bitch! Everywhere we go she pops up.
- Darling...

14:28.034 --> 14:32.119
- Like some kangaroo in heat.
- Oh, I can't understand her.

14:32.246 --> 14:36.080
- Can't you?
- Oh, I suppose it's my fault.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.576
I broke our engagement
and went off with you.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.372
She must be really unhappy.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.793
- She's revelling in every minute of it.
- No.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.337
Darling.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.260
We are the lucky ones.
Don't let Jackie spoil it.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.469
I won't.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.972
This is the perfect honeymoon.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.849
No one's gonna wreck it for us.

15:04.779 --> 15:05.814
I love you.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.526
I'll race you back.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.647
- Colonel Race!
- Poirot!

16:28.779 --> 16:31.146
Oh, I'm enchanted to see you!

16:31.282 --> 16:33.899
- Oh, my old friend! How capital!
- Yes.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.197
Oh, I haven't clapped eyes on you
since...

16:36.329 --> 16:38.991
Oh, that strange affair
of the decapitated clergyman.

16:39.123 --> 16:39.988
Yes, yes.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.367
I still think you were lucky
to find that cake knife up the chimney.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.996
Lucky? With me it's the exercise
of the little grey cells.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.338
Luck, I leave to the others.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.300
Yes, I'd forgotten
your opinions about yourself.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.385
Might one ask,
what are you doing here?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.175
I'm <i>les vacances.</i>

16:56.307 --> 17:00.050
Shortly I'm going up the Nile
on the steamer. And you?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.551
Oh, the same, oddly enough.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.599
Oh. In other words, you're
following one of the passengers.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.815
<i>No, no. Seufement les vacances,</i>
<i>man ami.</i>

17:07.944 --> 17:09.480
<i>On!</i>

17:09.612 --> 17:11.773
- Like yourself.
- Yes.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.568
This chair is free, eh?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.320
In this world, comrade,
nothing's free.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.118
- Bitte?
- Forget it. Sit down.

17:24.252 --> 17:29.042
- Danke. You are reading Das <i>Kapital?</i>
- Yes. I never travel without it.

17:30.258 --> 17:35.048
Dr Ludwig Bessner.
Of the Bessner Institute, Zurich.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.341
Jim Ferguson, citizen of the world.

17:38.849 --> 17:42.467
- You are on holiday, perhaps, eh?
- No.

17:42.603 --> 17:46.141
I'm observing the decline
of the capitalist system, my friend.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.687
<i>Oh, indeed.</i>

17:49.819 --> 17:53.687
Well, you've got
a good specimen there, eh?

17:53.823 --> 17:56.906
- The young Kaugummi heiress.
- That parasite?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.867
- You don't approve?
- She makes me sick.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.322
In any decent society...

18:03.457 --> 18:06.620
Ah, you may be right.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.960
She has altogether too much power.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.047
- Monsieur.
- Shukran jazeelan.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.506
<i>Tobin tcbin!</i>

18:23.978 --> 18:27.266
- Linnet? Linnet, honey!
- Uncle Andrew!

18:27.398 --> 18:30.516
What a surprise! I didn't know
you were travelling in Egypt!

18:30.651 --> 18:34.690
Well, it's very sudden. As a matter
of fact, I'm on my honeymoon.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.941
Your honeymoon? What do you know!
Is this the lucky young man?

18:40.202 --> 18:43.661
Darling, this is my American lawyer
and trustee, Andrew Pennington.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.655
Simon. Simon Doyle.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.748
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- How do you do?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.993
- Won't you join us?
- Well, just for a moment.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.338
But don't worry.
I'm not going to intrude.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.924
I know how young people are.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.339
The cynosure of all eyes.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.260
Even you, with your English reserve,
gaze.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.509
- She's very beautiful.
- Oh, she's very rich.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.056
You know who she is, of course.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.053
- Of course.
- Yes.

19:08.189 --> 19:12.183
Do forgive me for butting in,
but I have a bet with my daughter here,

19:12.318 --> 19:15.731
that you're Hercules Porridge,
the famous French sleuth.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.401
Not quite. I am Hercule Poirot,
the famous Belgian sleuth.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.275
I told you, Rosalie.

19:22.411 --> 19:26.951
There's only one Monsieur Poirot
in the world. He's unmistakable.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.916
As indeed I realise I am myself.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.536
My mother is Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.757
<i>Otter... Salo... Of course.
Enchanté.</i>

19:36.884 --> 19:39.967
So here we are,
two famous people in one plaoe.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.384
- Oh, three, surely.

19:43.516 --> 19:47.601
I was talking about genius,
not mere money, monsieur.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.437
Oh, you know Colonel Race,
my old friend?

19:51.565 --> 19:54.683
This is... and her daughter...

19:54.819 --> 19:56.355
Charmed, simply charmed.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.979
Please, sit down, madame, mademoiselle.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.284
You're probably working on
some other book now, madame.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.404
Set in Egypt, perhaps?

20:07.540 --> 20:12.080
How thrillingly clever of you
to deduce that, Monsieur Porridge!

20:12.211 --> 20:16.045
I am here to absorb local colour
for my grand opus,

20:16.173 --> 20:19.131
<i>Snow on the Sphinxb Face.</i>

20:19.260 --> 20:22.423
Frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love

20:22.555 --> 20:26.469
as this young English girl from
Haslemere, scarcely out of school,

20:26.600 --> 20:31.015
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheikh.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.138
Somehow, I don't think
Monsieur Poirot

20:33.274 --> 20:35.606
is a very keen reader
of romantic novels, Mother.

20:35.735 --> 20:41.572
Of course he is. All Frenchmen are.
They're not afraid of good, strong sex!

20:41.699 --> 20:46.114
Unlike, I might say, most of
our leading lending libraries.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.282
They have banned
Salome Otterbourne

20:48.414 --> 20:51.702
for speaking the truth
about men and women.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.745
But she goes on, nonetheless.

20:53.878 --> 20:58.964
The truth, yes. The truth.
It's so difficult to tell.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.165
Thank you, monsieur.

21:06.432 --> 21:11.643
Well, perhaps you would
join me in a tango, er, mademoiselle?

21:11.771 --> 21:15.685
A little exercise after dinner.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.522
- Do you tango, Colonel?
- Poorly, I'm afraid, Mrs Otterbourne.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.819
Then I shall teach you
to do it correctly,

21:25.951 --> 21:28.909
as it was done in old Spain,
when it was known as the "cheeker",

21:29.038 --> 21:32.156
that is to say,
with a sensuous, erotic dash.

22:28.389 --> 22:31.177
Damn it, Jackie!
Can't you leave us alone?

22:35.312 --> 22:36.552
Waiter.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.372
Monsieur Poirot!
Monsieur Poirot!

23:24.653 --> 23:26.860
I saw you with Linnet
this morning.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.980
How much is she paying you
to warn me off?

23:29.116 --> 23:32.154
No, no. I accepted no commission
from Madame Doyle, nor will I.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.527
What I have to say to you
is in pure friendship.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.826
Oh, yes? And what would
you like to say?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.826
That I'm making a public show of myself?
That I'm crazy?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.419
I say bury the dead.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.040
Not as the Egyptians do,

23:47.176 --> 23:50.919
preserving the body in order to ensure
the immortality of the soul.

23:51.055 --> 23:54.548
No. Properly, finally.
Turn your back on the past.

23:54.683 --> 24:00.520
Look only fonlvard.
Remember, time heals everything.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.682
If you think I'm suffering,
you're quite wrong.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.025
Actually, I'm rather
enjoying myself.

24:07.154 --> 24:11.364
Yes. Your pleasure is the very worst
part of it, mademoiselle.

24:12.743 --> 24:16.407
I don't care.
Simon was mine and he loved me.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.154
Then she came along and...

24:24.338 --> 24:26.204
It's only a tiny thing...

24:27.424 --> 24:28.630
...but it's lethal.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.551
And my father taught me
to be a crack shot.

24:35.057 --> 24:41.303
Sometimes, I swear I'll put this gun
right against her head,

24:41.438 --> 24:45.147
and then ever so gently
pull the trigger.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.815
When I hear that sound
more and more...

24:52.825 --> 24:57.945
I know how you feel.
We all feel like that at times.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.866
Only, I warn you, mademoiselle...

25:01.208 --> 25:06.123
Do not allow evil into your heart.
It will make a home there.

25:07.548 --> 25:12.167
If love can't live there,
evil will do just as well.

25:14.054 --> 25:18.469
Oh. How... How sad, mademoiselle.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.727
Hello, Mr P!

25:32.865 --> 25:35.072
- You're going back to the hotel?
- Where else?

25:35.200 --> 25:38.283
Look. It's a surprise for Linnet.
Do you think she'll like it?

25:38.412 --> 25:42.076
- That depends. Does she smoke?
- Just Craven "A".

25:43.125 --> 25:45.913
By the way... Have you had a chance
to talk to Jackie yet?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.752
Yes, just a few moments ago.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.668
Well, good. I hope you got
her to see some sense.

25:50.799 --> 25:55.043
Alas, to her,
sense is perpetual revenge.

25:55.179 --> 25:58.717
- Are you serious?
- I'm always serious, mon ami.

26:00.934 --> 26:05.223
Jackie's stubborn, I know,
and damn possessive.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.847
- But surely...
- Did she want to possess you?

26:07.983 --> 26:11.271
Well, I suppose so. Yes, she did.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.815
But she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.529
She wishes to wear the trousers.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.524
Yes. And a man can't have that,
can he, Mr P?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.617
<i>No, no, ne peut pas.</i>

26:21.705 --> 26:25.664
You know, when I first met Linnet...
Well, how should I put it?

26:25.793 --> 26:29.502
It was like the moon after sunrise. You
just don't notice it's there any more.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.213
After I met her,
Jackie just didn't exist.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.049
Yes. Some women have that power.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.215
But how are you going to find
a way out of your present dilemma?

26:38.347 --> 26:41.965
Well, I have the most marvellous plan
and it's absolutely foolproof.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.736
Cabby!

26:55.864 --> 26:59.323
The railway station, quickly.
We're late for the Alexandria train.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.299
The railway station!

27:18.512 --> 27:20.048
Fast as you can.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.713

28:40.761 --> 28:42.092
Thank you.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.137
Look. There she is.

28:58.195 --> 29:03.486
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Welcome aboard the Kamak. Yes.

29:03.617 --> 29:06.029
My name is Mr Choudry.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.243
I am the manager of this boat

29:08.372 --> 29:12.457
and your delight and happiness
is my sole concern and pleasure.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.915
Quite rightly.

29:14.044 --> 29:17.127
I have here... I have here...

29:17.256 --> 29:23.252
Yes, I have here a list of names and,
er... and, er... staterooms.

29:23.387 --> 29:28.257
I guess from your faces
which is which, OK?

29:28.392 --> 29:32.636
Er... You are Mrs and
Miss Otterbourne.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.353
- Righty?
- Wrong?

29:34.481 --> 29:36.188
I'm Mrs Van Schuyler

29:36.316 --> 29:39.684
and I wish to be taken
to my cabin immediately.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.814
Bowers will have the cabin opposite,
on the starboard side.

29:43.949 --> 29:47.487
The roasting afternoon sun
may do wonders

29:47.619 --> 29:50.611
for those jaundiced jowls of hers.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.363
Right away, Madam. Right away.

29:53.542 --> 29:58.537
Yes. You must be Dr Bessner.
Such elegant German moustaches.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.335
I'm afraid you'd never make
a detective, Monsieur.

30:02.467 --> 30:06.677
The moustaches, although
undeniably elegant, are Belgian.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.014
My name is Poirot, Hercule Poirot.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.635
Ah, the famous Monsieur Poirot?

30:13.770 --> 30:16.808
I grovel in mortification.
I grovel.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.058
Look, wouldn't it just be simpler
for us to give you our names

30:20.193 --> 30:22.309
and you to give us
the cabins that we booked?

30:22.446 --> 30:28.192
Simpler? Ah, lummy! Yes.
Unquestionably simpler. Unquestionably.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.785
Such a brilliant lack
of complication.

30:30.912 --> 30:35.201
In a trice, the safragi will
conduct you all to your stateroom.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.496
Safragi! Saf...

30:38.712 --> 30:39.747
<i>blows]</i>

30:39.880 --> 30:41.746
Ah, we start.

30:41.882 --> 30:46.046
May I suggest that you all take
your last look at the city?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.886
Safra... Safragi!

32:15.559 --> 32:19.803
Well, we've done it.
We got rid of her, at last.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.851
What did you expect?
You're a genius.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.399
Well, it's not bad
for the Simple Simon.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.155
<i>Blows]</i>

33:12.991 --> 33:14.026
Fabulous, isn't it?

33:15.911 --> 33:17.777
You're the Ridgeway girl,
aren't you?

33:18.914 --> 33:23.659
And you're Mrs Van Schuyler.
I wondered if we'd ever break the ice.

33:23.793 --> 33:28.833
Well, I seldom talk to strangers,
but never to strange honeymooners.

33:29.841 --> 33:34.506
- I'm glad you're breaking your rule.
- Well, rules are made to be broken.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.471
At least, mine are by me.

33:41.895 --> 33:45.854
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- Thank you.

33:45.982 --> 33:50.271
And amazing,
if you know how they're made.

33:52.072 --> 33:55.940
A tiny piece of grit makes
its way into an oyster

33:56.076 --> 34:00.991
which eventually becomes
a pearl of great price

34:01.122 --> 34:04.615
hanging round the neck
of a pretty girl like you.

34:06.336 --> 34:09.623
- I never thought of it that way.
- Well, you should.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.416
The oyster nearly dies.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.670
Come along now. Back to the cabin.
Time for your massage.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.389
My companion, Bowers.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.179
She did 15 rounds once
with Jack Dempsey.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.893
He was never the same man again.

34:26.022 --> 34:30.812
- Sorry, Miss Ridgeway.
- Mrs Doyle. Mrs Simon Doyle.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.810
You have got to forgive Miss Bowers.

34:32.946 --> 34:36.484
She's just unfamiliar
with the married state.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.449
- I saw you drooling over her pearls.
- Shut up, Bowers.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.491
You'd give every tooth in your head
to lay your hands on them.

34:42.621 --> 34:43.453
What nonsense.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.291
Just because you've got a grudge against
her father, no need to be uncivil.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.629
Grudge?
Melhuish Ridgeway ruined my family.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.963
Well, you should be grateful.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.630
If he hadn't, you'd have missed
the pleasure of working for me.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.130
I could kill her on that score alone.

35:04.561 --> 35:05.801
Tea, madame?

35:09.941 --> 35:13.684
I am Salome Otterbourne
and I must have a word.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.983
I thought we were already having words
through our lawyers.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.483
It is about that
that I have come to supplicate.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.529
Supplicate?

35:21.661 --> 35:24.619
I mean to entreat, or to appeal,
if you like.

35:24.748 --> 35:28.867
I'm afraid we authors are
a little ﬂowery in our speech.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.619
And defamatory in our writing.

35:32.714 --> 35:38.005
<i>I'm sorry you should have taken Passion
Under the Persimmon Tree that way.</i>

35:38.136 --> 35:42.004
I assure you the intention was
merely to show a young girl's heart

35:42.140 --> 35:44.973
beginning to beat
to the primordial drum.

35:46.519 --> 35:51.013
Can't you see, my dear, that what
I wrote was really quite ﬂattering?

35:51.149 --> 35:52.856
Frankly, Mrs Otterbourne,

35:52.984 --> 35:58.104
I don't consider being likened
to a nymphomaniacal baboon ﬂattering,

35:58.239 --> 36:02.233
and I suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation

36:02.369 --> 36:04.326
for being the butt
of your vulgar drivel!

36:04.454 --> 36:07.947
- Good afternoon.
- Philistine!

36:08.083 --> 36:11.417
I'll show you what reputation
is about!

36:35.110 --> 36:38.444
- I'm sorry to intrude.
- Uncle Andrew.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.438
But these are the papers
I told you needed signing.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.441
The lease on the Chrysler Building...

36:45.662 --> 36:50.202
Ah, let's see, the silver mine
concessions, Baku oil transfers

36:50.333 --> 36:53.621
and the Cam Crisp Chou-choc merger.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.639
Just sign on the last page,
right on the bottom, my dear.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.008
But, Uncle Andrew,
I haven't even read it yet.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.479
There's no need, there's no need.
It's all quite straightforward.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.268
Checked and double checked by me.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.893
But I always read everything
through before I sign.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.814
My father taught me that.

37:20.947 --> 37:24.065
He always said never to trust anyone.
Not even your own lawyers.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.158
Dear old Melhuish.
What a sense of humour!

37:27.287 --> 37:30.871
Well, as far as I'm concerned, I've
never read a legal document in my life.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.865
I certainly don't intend to start now.

37:34.294 --> 37:35.204
You don't say.

37:36.212 --> 37:39.295
- Isn't that a little feckless, darling?
- Yes, absolutely.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.791
But I'm dying for a Manhattan,
aren't you?

37:42.844 --> 37:46.087
Alright.
Seeing we're on our honeymoon.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.462
That's a girl.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.052
Now, the next one.

37:54.105 --> 37:57.268
I do hope I'm not, er, butting in.
I am a lawyer.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.643
I just wanted to say how much I admire
your businesslike attitude.

38:00.779 --> 38:04.898
Your father was absolutely right. Never
sign a document until you've read it.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.819
I'm sure you agree, sir.

38:06.951 --> 38:11.036
Er, sure. Sure. There's no hurry.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.866
Well, now, if you'll excuse me.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.465
I hope I've not given of fence.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.004
What if you have, Mr...?

38:25.136 --> 38:28.094
- Race. Colonel Race.
- What if you have, Colonel?

38:28.223 --> 38:30.464
Lawyers are trained
to deal with of fences.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.642
Would you join us for a drink
in the bar?

38:33.770 --> 38:36.808
- Thank you. Most kind.
- And what about you, Mr P?

38:36.940 --> 38:39.022
After all,
there's cause for celebration.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.767
As you see, my plan to lose Jackie
worked like a charm.

38:41.903 --> 38:45.612
Yes, so it would, <i>er...</i>
so it would seem.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.651
<i>Mes félicitations.</i>

38:47.784 --> 38:50.526
Colonel Race and
will join you in a, er...

38:52.872 --> 38:54.112
...moment.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.580
Darling?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.332
- Madame, I must talk with you.
- Later, Louise.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.835
- No, now! It's important.
- I'll see you in the bar.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.675
- Well?
- I've received a cable.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.516
My fiancé has sent his woman
back to her people.

39:14.644 --> 39:17.557
He's waiting for me.
I must go to him.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.181
Please, give me the money
that you promised me.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.478
I've been with you for five years now.

39:22.610 --> 39:28.026
- It's completely out of the question.
- Madame, you promised me.

39:28.157 --> 39:32.071
- He's still married, Louise.
- I implore you.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.992
I need that money as a dowry.
I've worked hard for you.

39:36.124 --> 39:39.116
And you'll continue to do
so until I say otherwise.

39:39.252 --> 39:42.961
- Madame, you can't refuse me.
- Thank you, Louise.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.544
Chasm-as!

39:50.179 --> 39:53.717
Mon Dies, how she makes
enemies of them all.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.558
Even her own lawyer
is trying to cheat her?

39:56.686 --> 39:58.927
You old fox! So you noticed?

39:59.063 --> 40:01.725
Well, I knew that you weren't here...
How was it again?

40:01.858 --> 40:04.646
<i>"Seufement pour les vacaxaces,</i>
<i>man ami."</i>

40:05.987 --> 40:07.318
Yes, I suppose I can tell you.

40:07.447 --> 40:10.690
Sub rosa, I am working
for Mrs Doyle's English lawyers,

40:10.825 --> 40:13.692
and they suspect Andrew Pennington
of... well, of...

40:13.828 --> 40:16.445
- Embezzling her money.
- That's about the size of it.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.743
You see, under the terms
of the father's will,

40:18.875 --> 40:22.539
she gets control of the money when
she marries, and as she has married...

40:22.670 --> 40:24.581
He is trying to get her
to sign a document

40:24.714 --> 40:26.330
which will get him out of the soup.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.958
Exactly. I think I've scared him off
for the moment,

40:29.093 --> 40:31.425
but who knows what he'll try next?

40:31.554 --> 40:33.966
Or any of them, for that matter.

42:44.479 --> 42:47.471
"Inside the Great Temple of Karnak,

42:47.607 --> 42:52.852
we pass the pedestals
of numerous small rams." Ja.

42:52.987 --> 42:58.448
"Each with a small image
of Amenophis Ill in front of it." Yeah.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.943
Oh, yes, rams.

43:01.079 --> 43:05.164
Lickerish, priapic, ruttish rams!

43:05.291 --> 43:06.531
How noble they are!

43:06.667 --> 43:12.629
With their proud ﬂanks, ﬂared nostrils
and unashamed curled horns.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.465
Ja. Ja, come, Fraulein, come.

43:19.472 --> 43:23.511
You know, Karl Marx said that
religion was the opium of the people.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.805
For your mother,
it's obviously sex.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.894
Don't you think
you better calm her down?

43:28.022 --> 43:30.229
She'd do one of those beasts
a fearful injury.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.816
Mr Ferguson, my mother may be
a figure of fun for you,

43:32.944 --> 43:34.776
but she still happens to be my mother.

43:34.904 --> 43:39.068
She kept me marvellously in better days.
I'm not going to desert her now that...

43:40.535 --> 43:42.776
- Now that what?
- Nothing.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.913
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be nosy.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.248
And I certainly didn't mean
to offend you.

43:49.377 --> 43:51.994
Honestly, Miss Otlerbourne,
I am not as bad as I look.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.041
- Aren't you?
- Scout's honour'?

43:59.762 --> 44:04.006
- Would you mind offending her?
- Linnet Ridgeway's a leech.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.008
A parasite on the skin of society.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.760
For God's sake, in a sane world,

44:07.895 --> 44:10.102
she'd be bumped off
as a warning to the others.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.892
- Bumped off?
- That's what I said.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.316
- Mr Ferguson?
- Jim.

44:15.444 --> 44:18.653
Jim, is it true
you can't libel the dead?

44:20.366 --> 44:23.279
I'm not sure I understand the question.

44:23.411 --> 44:24.401
Never mind.

44:24.537 --> 44:29.623
Oh, look, isn't it wonderful?
Quite beyond comprehension!

44:29.750 --> 44:32.367
Ah, the artistic temperament,
Monsieur Pennington.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.291
What strange forms it takes!

44:35.423 --> 44:38.415
I'm afraid that doesn't
much concern me, Monsieur Poirot.

44:38.551 --> 44:41.259
I confine myself
to the world of facts and figures.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.596
The ancient Egyptians felt
quite at home with facts and figures.

44:44.724 --> 44:47.261
The Grand vizier Ptahhotep

44:47.393 --> 44:51.512
was crushed to death
under a thousand pieces of silver

44:51.647 --> 44:54.856
because he embezzled
his master's treasury.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.811
- You don't say.
- Oh, yes.

48:24.610 --> 48:28.774
God! You alright?
Linnet, you alright?

48:30.366 --> 48:32.983
Come on. Easy.

48:33.119 --> 48:36.157
That's it, come on, up you come.
Alright?

48:38.332 --> 48:39.618
What happened?

48:39.750 --> 48:42.583
That stone must have fallen
or was pushed.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.955
- To kill me?
- Jackie!

48:48.259 --> 48:49.920
But she's not here!

49:17.121 --> 49:19.237
Oh, my poor madame,
that was a close shave.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.740
- It could've been a nasty accident.
- Accident?

49:21.876 --> 49:23.992
That stone has been up there
for 4,000 years.

49:24.128 --> 49:27.371
It chooses the moment to fall
when there are people underneath? No.

49:27.506 --> 49:30.248
Not exactly 4,000 years, Herr Poirot.

49:30.384 --> 49:34.378
- These pillars were built in 1788...
- We all agree with you, Herr Bessner.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.675
You may have a patient on your hands.
Please.

49:36.807 --> 49:40.266
Oh, most negligent of me!
Ja, ja, here.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.725
I'm alright. Really I am.

49:41.854 --> 49:45.848
Ja, ja, but I think maybe you go back
to the boat, you take a little rest, eh?

49:45.983 --> 49:49.977
Alright. But only for a
couple of hours, doctor.

49:50.112 --> 49:52.854
I must see the Temple of Abu Simbel
this evening.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.778
Oh, that is most extraordinary.

49:55.910 --> 50:00.245
Did you know that the easternmost figure
is the famous Vocal Statue?

50:00.372 --> 50:02.158
<i>- Really?
- Ja.</i>

50:02.291 --> 50:05.283
Then we must be there in time.
Thank you, doctor.

50:06.504 --> 50:09.587
At sunset it emits
a sad, plaintive note.

50:09.715 --> 50:12.173
- He scares me.
- Oh, he's harmless.

50:44.625 --> 50:47.492
My God, it's fantastic.

50:47.628 --> 50:50.541
I think they're frightening.

50:50.673 --> 50:52.129
No, they're not.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.470
Do you think he'll sing
a note for me?

51:03.602 --> 51:06.560
Why not? You're divine.

51:36.343 --> 51:41.964
Welcome to the Temple of Abu Simbel.
The facade is 84 feet long.

51:42.099 --> 51:46.639
Each of the statues of Ramesses II
is 65 feet high.

51:49.898 --> 51:55.735
Get away from me! Get away!
Get away from me!

51:55.863 --> 51:59.572
OK, darling!
Don't let her spoil everything.

52:34.985 --> 52:38.774
So you could not bury your dead.
You cannot stay away.

52:38.906 --> 52:41.147
Nope, I can't keep away.

52:41.283 --> 52:44.901
You didn't really think I'd be fooled
by any trick Simon could invent?

52:46.830 --> 52:50.118
I'm very sorry to see you here,
mademoiselle.

52:50.250 --> 52:51.456
Forgive me for saying so,

52:51.585 --> 52:55.499
but you're embarking on
a hazardous journey in troubled waters.

52:55.631 --> 52:59.920
You face who knows
what currents of misfortune.

53:00.052 --> 53:02.919
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's the truth.

53:03.055 --> 53:06.423
You're cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety.

53:07.476 --> 53:10.013
You can still turn back
if you really want to.

53:11.814 --> 53:15.023
One must follow one's star
wherever it leads.

53:15.984 --> 53:20.273
- Even to disaster?
- Even to hell itself.

53:30.165 --> 53:33.374
I left my bag in the bar.
I'll join you in a minute, darling.

53:45.389 --> 53:49.678
Well... We are alone, meme Frau.

53:49.810 --> 53:54.145
The opportunity to talk to you in
private has not presented itself before.

53:55.399 --> 53:59.358
- What do we have to talk about?
- My reputation, Frau Doyle.

54:00.320 --> 54:03.779
- You ran that institute in Zurich.
- That is so.

54:03.907 --> 54:06.820
And you have been saying
so many unpleasant things about me

54:06.952 --> 54:10.240
to people of influence
and position.

54:10.372 --> 54:12.204
- I say you're a quack.
- Frau Doyle!

54:12.332 --> 54:14.869
- You're a dangerous quack.
- Now, listen to me!

54:15.002 --> 54:18.085
My good friend Myra Seligman
listened to you. Too well!

54:18.213 --> 54:21.046
And allowed you to give her
those filthy injections.

54:21.175 --> 54:24.543
I prescribed a course
of armadillo urine.

54:24.678 --> 54:28.763
Ja, I had used it previously
with great success.

54:28.891 --> 54:32.429
In the case of poor Myra,
she went barking mad, thanks to you.

54:32.561 --> 54:33.892
I will not allow this.

54:34.021 --> 54:37.605
These irresponsible remarks
about my treatment have got to stop!

54:37.733 --> 54:40.521
Then sue me, if you dare.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.859
Now, you know that is impossible.

54:42.988 --> 54:46.526
Any scandal attached to my clinic
would bring instant ruin.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.150
Then it's rather your funeral,
isn't it?

54:50.537 --> 54:54.701
Well, let's hope that
it is not yours!

54:54.833 --> 54:58.417
Do you want a créme de cacao,
or a cognac, perhaps?

54:58.545 --> 55:01.003
The service upstairs is so slow.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.463
<i>Nein. Danke-</i>

55:24.947 --> 55:26.563
What time is it?

55:28.325 --> 55:31.534
There's a clock. Use your eyes.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.996
Didn't your mother ever tell you,
as far as servants are concerned,

55:35.123 --> 55:36.659
there is a vast difference

55:36.792 --> 55:40.160
between amiable eccentricity
and downright rudeness?

55:40.295 --> 55:41.456
My mother was a lady.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.704
A disposition she failed
to pass on to you.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.081
It's your bedtime.

55:45.217 --> 55:48.335
- Very well. Where's my stole?
- I haven't seen it.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.970
- You sure you had it with you?
- Of course I'm sure.

55:52.099 --> 55:55.057
- Well, I haven't seen it anywhere.
- Use your eyes.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.972
Monsieur Poirot?

56:03.735 --> 56:08.445
I hope one day you'll be able
to tell me about some of your cases.

56:08.574 --> 56:11.532
The... the juicier ones.

56:11.660 --> 56:14.072
- Juicier ones?
- Bloodier.

56:14.204 --> 56:18.038
Ah! <i>Comme vous voulez, madame.</i>

56:19.209 --> 56:22.122
- Goodnight. Goodnight, monsieur.
- Bonsoir.

56:28.302 --> 56:30.760
- Oh! So sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.639
You look very sleepy tonight,
Monsieur Porridge.

56:35.767 --> 56:39.852
Yes, I'm extremely.
I am consumed by sleep, Madame.

56:39.980 --> 56:44.099
I don't know why,
but I can hardly keep my eyes open.

56:44.234 --> 56:47.192
<i>Naughty. Me, too.</i>

56:47.321 --> 56:50.279
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to escort me to my cabin?

56:52.367 --> 56:54.574
It is this way, as you know.

56:58.081 --> 57:03.326
I suppose that uncouth young man will
appear now and attempt to seduce you.

57:03.462 --> 57:06.921
Well, don't let him succeed
without at least the show of a struggle.

57:07.049 --> 57:11.168
- Remember, the chase is very important.
- Oh, Mother!

57:12.888 --> 57:14.845
No, this way is better.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.635
There's a beastly step here,
which I always trip on.

57:17.768 --> 57:19.429
No, no, that's the river!

57:27.903 --> 57:29.814
No, no. No, no, no...

57:29.947 --> 57:32.188
The old Nile is a bit choppy tonight,
monsieur.

57:32.324 --> 57:35.066
It is true.
There are disturbing currents.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.077
Here we are. Here we are.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.116
No, no, no, no. In there.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.956
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir! Bonsoir, madame.</i>

58:08.026 --> 58:09.312
Hello.

58:11.363 --> 58:15.778
- Been ashore?
- Yes. It's lovely in the moonlight.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.616
A real honeymoon night.

58:18.704 --> 58:22.038
If the clergyman's daughter
drinks nothing but water

58:23.709 --> 58:25.791
she's certain to finish on gin

58:26.878 --> 58:28.334
One diamond.

58:29.548 --> 58:31.880
- Simon, we're waiting.
- Sorry.

58:36.430 --> 58:38.216
It's your call.

58:39.307 --> 58:41.264
- Double.
- What?

58:41.393 --> 58:44.135
<i># He was her man</i>

58:44.271 --> 58:47.389
<i># But he was doing her wrong</i>

58:48.608 --> 58:50.690
- Join me?
- No, thank you.

58:53.155 --> 58:56.773
- Would you mind repeating your bid?
- Sorry.

58:56.908 --> 58:59.775
If the aunt of the vicar
has never touched liquor

58:59.911 --> 59:02.494
just wait till she finds the champagne

59:02.622 --> 59:03.953
Bottoms up!

59:04.082 --> 59:06.574
I'm sorry, darling, I wasn't thinking.

59:08.003 --> 59:11.962
<i># Swore to be true to each other</i>

59:12.090 --> 59:15.048
- <i>#</i> True <i>as</i> tire stars.--
- I'm afraid that gives you the rubber.

59:15.177 --> 59:16.963
- # He was her man
- I think I'll go to bed.

59:17.095 --> 59:20.008
- I think it's time to turn in.
- I'll second that.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.924
- Goodnight. Sleep tight.
- Goodnight.

59:24.061 --> 59:27.019
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.
- Coming, Simon?

59:27.147 --> 59:30.185
I won't be a second, darling.
I'll just tidy up.

59:30.317 --> 59:31.807
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

59:31.943 --> 59:33.684
It is late. I think I'll
be going, too.

59:33.820 --> 59:38.860
Oh, no, no. You, sit down!
Tell me all about yourself.

59:38.992 --> 59:40.983
There's not very much to tell, really.

59:41.119 --> 59:43.531
I'm Salome Otterbourne's daughter,
as you know.

59:43.663 --> 59:46.371
If the wife of a divine
has never touched wine

59:46.500 --> 59:48.958
you can bet she'll end up
with the Scotch

59:51.046 --> 59:56.507
Go on, you were something... saying
something about somebody's daughter.

59:57.636 --> 01:00:01.425
- Salome Otterbourne, the novelist.
- Salome?

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:04.298
Didn't she have
some fellow's head cut off?

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.971
It should happen
to somebody else I know.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.012
Don't you think you've had enough?

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.388
- Enough what?
- To drink.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.983
To drink? What business
is it of yours?

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.068
- None, I suppose.
- Damn right.

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.858
- What's the matter, Simon, afraid?
- Afraid of what?

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:25.282
Afraid I might tell this charming
young lady the story of my life.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:28.280
- I really must be going.
- No, no, wait!

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:32.705
It's a very sad tale. A three-hanky
story if you're easily moved.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:35.671
- For God's sake, Jackie.
- What?

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:40.467
Go to bed and stop making
a fool of yourself.

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:46.682
Oh, Simon says I'm making a fool
of myself. Simon says go to bed.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:51.475
Bed! You make me sick!

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:55.315
- Go to bed!
- You can't treat me like this!

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.150
Now look, Jackie!

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:59.816
- I'll kill you first!
- Jackie!

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:19.298
- Quick. Help him!
- Jesus.

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.758
Oh. My God!

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.754
I'll get Dr Bessner.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.387
Get her to her cabin.
Calm her down.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.931
What have I done?!

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:37.854
Oh, that Bowers woman. She's a nurse,
isn't she? Get her to look after her.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:41.603
Come on.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.115
<i>Simon!</i>

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.234
Make sure she's not left alone.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:52.869
Then get the doctor! Quickly!

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.008
Lie down.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.894
I'll get Miss Bowers.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:18.690
- Simon. Simon!
- Take it easy.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:22.527
Rosalie's gone to get Miss Bowers.
She's a nurse. She'll look after you.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.368
You've been the devil of a time.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.122
Miss Bowers had gone to bed.
She'll be here in a minute.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.044
- The sooner the better.
- How is she?

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.464
As well as can be expected for a girl
who tried to shoot her ex-lover.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.837
How can you be so heartless?

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:54.386
There now. Miss Bowers is just coming.
It'll be alright.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:57.889
- It'll be alright.
- It's Doyle. There's been an accident.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.686
Yes, yes. Miss Otterboure told me.

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:06.359
I think a shot of morphia
will meet the case.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:11.577
I've always found it very effective
when Mrs Van Schuyler is canying on.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:15.744
Ferguson, you'd better go and get
that Hun doctor from next door.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:18.617
- He ought to have a look at Doyle.
- Yes, right.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.878
Bad, this.
Get me one more cloth, fa?

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:30.049
Alright.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:39.437
The bone is fractured.
There is much losses of blood, ja.

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:43.434
Alright. Alright, alright.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.857
Help me get him to <i>my</i> cabin, ja?

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:51.654
Are you afraid of a little blood
like a young Madchen?

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.778
Come here, Ferguson. Help me get him up.

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:03.788
I'll stay with her tonight. You never
know how they're going to react.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:08.300
- Miss Bowers, is she quiet?
- Yes.

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.921
Yes, I've given her some morphia.
I won't leave her.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:15.516
Ah, good.
Young lady, you come with me, ja?

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:18.260
You'll be more use
than this Stutzer here,

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.558
who's afraid at the sight
of a little blood.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.146
Open the door. Ja.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:29.985
Easy, alright, alright. That's it.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:33.108
<i>Almost... Here we are. Ja.</i>

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:44.043
<i>Ja.</i>

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.801
Alright. Could you get
a cool towel for the head, ja?

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:52.636
Yes, doctor.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:05.603
- Ja.
- I'd better go and pick up that gun.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.898
It's not the sort of thing we want
to leave lying around, is it?

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.862
- Ja.
- Yes.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:14.233
Jackie. She mustn't be left alone.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.030
She isn't. Don't worry.

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:23.079
Oh, God. It's all been my fault.
I treated her so badly.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:27.037
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was drunk.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.210
Now, this is going to hurt.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.134
Are you sure someone
shouldn't tell your wife?

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.221
Yes. Yes, please.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:46.349
No. Ho, no, let her sleep.
Nothing to worry her till morning.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:52.192
The best I can do is patch it up.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:56.783
There is no exit wound.
The bullet is lodged deep in there.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:06:00.495
Ja, it will have to wait
until we get to Wadi Halfa.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.205
Roll up the sleeve.

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.746
And swab it with this, eh?

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:11.590
Ja. I will have some splints made.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:15.757
And then I will set them
when you are asleep, eh?

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:19.883
- Thank you, doctor.
- Ja. Now, don't you worry.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.969
Everything's going to be alright.

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.061
It's not there.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.274
- Was?
- The gun. It's not there.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:41.782
But who could have taken it?

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:44.873
Search me.
I only hope it's not important.

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:49.601
"Sometimes I want to put
this little gun up to her head,

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.599
and very gently pull the trigger."

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:57.271
- Was?
- Oh, nothing.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.485
The manager put the matter in my hands,

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:06.534
so it'll be our responsibility
until we reach Wadi Haifa.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.623
Well, I am at your disposal,
of course.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.288
So, doctor,
what can you tell us about this?

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.755
She was shot with a very small bullet.

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:19.126
A .22 calibre, I think. And the gun was
held very close to the head.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.924
<i>Here you can see all the versengen.</i>

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:25.474
Damn it, man, can't you speak English?

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.890
- Oh, you mean the scorching.
- Ja, ja, the scorching.

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:32.852
Excuse me.

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.651
<i>'Hens, tiens, tiens...</i>

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:49.535
- What do you make of that?
- Huh?

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:54.332
Oh, I think it's... I think it's easy.
You see, Madame Doyle was dying.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.876
She wished to identify
the murderer to us,

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.591
and therefore she dipped her finger
in her own blood.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.711
She wrote "J" on the wall. "Jacqueline"!

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:07.386
Oh, what you say is dumb.
The lady dies instantly!

01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:08.724
- Really?
- Ja.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:11.435
There is no time for writing
with the finger in blood.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.352
- No, no.
- Oh, you make a joke?

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:18.227
Well, it's a very small one.
Not in very good taste, I'm afraid.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:22.732
The fact remains the "J" is on the wall.
Now it's up to us to explain why.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:27.987
It seems a gesture
which is childishly melodramatic.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:31.831
- Doctor, what about the time of death?
- Well...

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:36.578
She has been dead at least six hours,
no longer than eight.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.955
That puts it between midnight
and 2:00am.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.332
- Which is extraordinary.
- Why is that?

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:44.461
Because it means quite simply
that Mademoiselle Jacqueline

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.304
could not have done it.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:48.719
<i>You told me yourself,
mon Colonel,</i>

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:53.345
<i>that Madame Doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 11:45 p.m.,</i>

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:54.812
<i>to go to bed.</i>

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.103
<i>And from then on, Jackie was in view</i>

01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:00.023
<i>either of Mademoiselle Rosalie
and Monsieur Doyle</i>

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.146
<i>or Monsieur Ferguson
and Mademoiselle Bowers,</i>

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:08.698
<i>who injected her with morphia and
stayed with her in her cabin all night.</i>

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:13.373
And Simon Doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.287
I don't suppose he could walk very far?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.661
Not one step, I assure you.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:21.461
Excellent! Let's hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.299
I am afraid it will net, men Colonel.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.044
Everyone on this boat knew

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:28.046
exactly why Mademoiselle Jacqueline
hated Madame Doyle.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:32.551
She was a natural for what
the Americans would call a "frame-up".

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:36.601
At least, main Herr;
you cannot suspect me!

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:38.223
Oh, why not?

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:41.977
You had a very good reason to kill her,
as I discovered last night.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:45.276
Oh. Then you did overhear!

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.571
But that was no motive.
I mean, I could have sued her.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:54.665
- And risk ruin? Murder is cheaper.
- And safer, if you don't get caught.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:57.124
But I could not have done such a thing.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.209
I disagree.

01:10:58.337 --> 01:11:01.830
<i>At the time of the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle,</i>

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:05.925
<i>you could have been on deck,
perhaps unable to sleep.</i>

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:10.256
<i>You could have heard
the sound of voices...</i>

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:14.225
<i>..looked through the window
of the saloon, seen what happened...</i>

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:16.970
- Go to bed!
- You can't treat me like this!

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.517
Now look, Jackie!

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:20.515
I'll kill you first!

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:22.767
Jackie!

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.819
<i>..And remembered
the position of the gun.</i>

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:32.034
<i>Later, when you were
called from your cabin,</i>

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:37.249
<i>you could have picked up the gun
while you were tending Monsieur Doyle.</i>

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.788
<i>Later still, when all was quiet,</i>

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:44.586
<i>you could have left your cabin,
unobsen/ed by your sleeping patient,</i>

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:48.756
<i>and gone to Madame Doyle's cabin
and shot her.</i>

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.886
No, Herr Doctor, I cannot rule you out.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:57.807
What you are suggesting is Ubermabig!

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.603
Outrageous! Ja!

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:06.694
No, I will not stay here
to be insulted.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:42.181
Found something in the nail varnish?

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:45.809
On n'at£rape pas les mauahes
avec le urfnaigre.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:46.855
I beg your pardon?

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:51.528
It's an old French proverb,
which takes too long to explain.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:54.822
Come, my friend. Let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.820
of the paying customers.

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.581
How long was it, in your estimation,

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:08.958
between the time you and Dr Bessner
carried Monsieur Doyle from the saloon

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:11.460
to when you returned
to look for the gun?

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:15.965
- Oh, about three or four minutes.
- Three or four minutes.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.434
You were just outside the saloon
when the shooting took place.

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.929
It would have been
perfectly possible for you

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.021
to have noted the position of the gun.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.982
I agree. Perfectly possible.

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:32.402
Perfectly possible also for you to have
waited until the saloon was empty,

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:37.369
then to have taken the gun
and only pretended not to have found it.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.914
<i>Then, before returning
to Dr Bessner to report its loss,</i>

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:52.088
<i>you could have used it
to kill Madame Doyle.</i>

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:55.428
I could have done,
but as it happens, I didn't!

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.181
And you, mademoiselle?

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.926
You could have taken the gun
before you left here,

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:04.976
when Monsieur Ferguson
was helping Monsieur Doyle.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.733
- I'll get Miss Bowers.
- Yeah, right.

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.824
<i>On your way to fetch Miss Bowers,</i>

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.795
<i>you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to Madame Doylek cabin</i>

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:30.413
<i>and murder her.</i>

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:41.220
<i>It would have added only a minute
or two to the time that you were away.</i>

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:45.186
Miss Bowers! Wake up! Miss Bowers!

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.899
- What's that?
- Could you please come quickly?

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:53.270
Why should either of us
take the blasted gun?

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.397
We have no reason
to murder Linnet Doyle.

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.945
Ah, but she was "a leech".

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.535
She was "a parasite
on the skin of society"

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:03.781
- who "deserved to be bumped off".
- Well, yes, but...

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:07.659
Oh, yes, monsieur. "Bumped off
as a warning to the others".

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.536
You damned froggy eavesdropper.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:14.041
Belgian. Belgian eavesdropper,
if you please, sir.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:19.137
And you, mademoiselle. You were eager
to save your mother great damages.

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.427
How could I possibly have done that?

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:24.551
You asked a question two days ago.
I will now answer it for you.

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:29.682
You are quite right, mademoiselle.
You cannot libel the dead.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.525
I think you're horrid.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:34.690
You pretend to be
so kind and considerate,

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.483
and all you want to do is trap us.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:42.573
I must find out what lies hidden,
mademoiselle. The truth.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:47.783
What it amounts to, then, is after
you gave Miss Jacqueline the morphia,

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:49.829
she never stirred all night.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.750
Exactly. Nervous reaction, booze
and morphia.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.214
Together, they'd have sunk the Titanic.

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:58.175
So, unquestionably,
she could not have done the murder'?

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:00.921
No, absolutely not.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:05.267
No, but you could have.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:09.891
- Me?
- Yes, you, mademoiselle.

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:13.062
Let us suppose you were out on deck
at the time of the shooting

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:17.904
and saw what took place, and thus knew
where the gun was lying.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:21.570
Young lady, you come with me, ja?

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.160
You'll be more help
than this Stutzer here

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:27.906
who's scared at the sight
of a little blood.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:31.034
<i>While Monsieur Ferguson
and Mademoiselle Rosalie</i>

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.207
<i>were assisting Dr Bessner,</i>

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:37.958
<i>you could have left your patient
and run in here to pick up the gun.</i>

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.584
<i>You would have had enough time</i>

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.429
<i>before Monsieur Ferguson returned
to search for it.</i>

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:01.444
<i>Then you could have hurried down
the pon' side to Madame Day/ea cabin</i>

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:02.906
<i>and shot her.</i>

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:08.033
Preposterous.
Why should I kill Mrs Doyle?

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:10.827
Because her father was
Melhuish Ridgeway,

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.453
whose unscrupulous business methods
ruined your father

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:17.250
and condemned you to a servant's life.

01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:20.125
Poppycock. From whom did you hear that?

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.844
From your own lips, mademoiselle,
three days ago.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.805
How dare you listen
to a private conversation!

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.924
Some voices carry.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.593
Is it true?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.858
<i>- Yes, it is.
- Voilá.</i>

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:41.105
But why should I kill Mrs Doyle
for something that happened years ago?

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:46.280
Because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day.

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.619
No, unfortunately, mademoiselle,

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:51.489
I cannot be persuaded
by your protestations.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.663
To my mind, you had the means,
the motive, the opportunity,

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:58.333
and what is more,
the disposition to kill.

01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:00.581
Have you quite finished,
Monsieur Poirot?

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:01.628
For the time being.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.298
Hold yourself ready to answer further
questions should the need arise.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:08.924
- I shall do no such thing.
- Monsieur Poirot!

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:16.057
- It is true about Linnet?
- It is perfectly true.

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:25.902
I didn't kill her. I know
you all think I did, but I didn't.

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.742
<i>Calmez vous, calmez vous, ma petit.</i>

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.783
We know that you did not kill
Madame Doyle. We have proved it.

01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:32.371
- Proved!
- Thank God.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:35.533
What about Simon? Is he alright?

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:39.708
Dr Bessner seems reasonably satisfied
with his condition so far.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.714
I was mad last night.
I might have killed him.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:52.558
- Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
- It's more than likely.

01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:54.097
It's been my experience

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.973
that men are least attracted
to women who treat them well.

01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:01.897
Miss Bowers, escort Miss Jacqueline
to her cabin and see that she's alright.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:06.314
We'll arrange a visit
to Monsieur Doyle later.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.157
Oh, thank you.

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:26.217
I think you and I should visit him
first. He must be awake by now.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:29.928
<i>Vérité.</i>

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:35.434
The thing which intrig...

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:39.392
...intrigues me most about
this case is the pistol.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.357
- The pistol?
- Why is it missing?

01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:43.146
I fail to see why that is important.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.361
In many cases
the murder weapon is missing.

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:48.777
Even in a case
where a frame-up is attempted? No.

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:53.699
Why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing "J" on the wall in blood,

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.492
and then removing J's gun?

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.082
Yes, I see what you mean.
Oh, they found something.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:04.047
One thing is for certain.
Madame Doyle was not killed by a fish.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:43.541
- Are you alright?
- Yes, thank you.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.834
I must have just blacked out
for a moment.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:48.583
Try a spot of lunch.
It might give you some strength.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.837
- No, thank you. I couldn't face it.
- You couldn't face it?

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:55.135
- Do you permit that, er...
- Please, do. Help yourself.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.602
I just can't believe that...

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.063
...that Linnet's dead.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.533
It's a bad knock.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:19.285
I suppose it must look awfully black
against Jackie,

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:22.499
but I just know she wouldn't
commit cold-blooded murder.

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.539
No, rest assured, monsieur,

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:27.379
we know for a fact it was
not Mademoiselle Jackie.

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:28.714
Thank God for that.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:32.551
Well, then, do you have any idea
who it might have been?

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.593
Well, it could have been
practically anybody.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:39.843
Well, only yesterday
she was saying

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:42.185
everyone around her on this boat
was her enemy.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:46.148
We have reason to believe
that she was right, monsieur.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:52.897
Monsieur...

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.240
<i>Oh, pardon.</i>

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.031
I came to see if you were comfortable.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.871
As comfortable as can be expected.
Thank you, Louise.

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:02.615
Ah, the discoverer of the body.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.083
You should be able to shed
some light on all this.

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:07.169
<i>Pardon?</i>

01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:11.291
You, you, you accuse me?
A respectable girl?

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:14.920
- I swear to you on my mother's grave...
- Allons, allons, Louise.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:18.639
<i>Pas tant d'histoires.</i>
<i>II fast dire la vérité.</i>

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.257
<i>Asseyez vous.</i>

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:40.904
Poirot, can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand?

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:45.078
She said that all the world
loved Madame Doyle.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.042
At least that's a fresh approach.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:52.007
Now then, when did you last see
Mrs Doyle alive?

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:56.219
Last night, monsieur. I was in her cabin
to undress her and put her to bed.

01:22:56.346 --> 01:23:00.635
- And then where did you go?
- To my cabin. Where else?

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:04.055
And you didn't see or hear anything
after that that might help us?

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:07.806
How oould I, monsieur? My cabin
was on the other side of the boat.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:14.980
Naturally, if I'd been unable to sleep,
if I'd stayed on deck then,

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:19.404
perhaps I would have seen this assassin
enter and leave madame's cabin.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.032
But as it <i>is...</i>

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.952
Oh, monsieur, I implore you!
You see how it is.

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:28.872
- What else can I say?
- Nobody's accusing you of anything.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.291
New, don't worry, Louise.
I'll look after you.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:33.539
- Monsieur is very good.
- But...

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:40.805
If you had not gone straight back to
your cabin after leaving Madame Doyle,

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.594
you would have had time

01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:45.468
to witness the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle in the saloon.

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:48.016
<i>- Ah, non!
- Ah, oui!</i>

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:51.607
You could have walked on the deck,
seen everything.

01:23:51.735 --> 01:23:55.399
Then when the coast was clear,
you could have taken the gun...

01:23:55.531 --> 01:23:56.862
<i>.. Returned...</i>

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.822
<i>..and shot Madame Doyle.</i>

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:05.117
Monsieur, you accuse me unjustly.

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.911
Why should I do such a wicked thing?
Just answer me that.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.000
Oh, Louise.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:14.122
I know all about you,
and your love affair,

01:24:14.258 --> 01:24:17.922
and Madame Doyle's objections
to your leaving her.

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:22.513
But I had no money and no references.
I had no choice but to stay.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:25.053
Précisément.
And how you hated her for that.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:26.675
But I didn't kill her!

01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:32.857
One final question, Louise.
Where are Madame Doyle's pearls?

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:38.904
Her pearls?
She was wearing them last night.

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:40.818
She put them on the table by her bed.

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:46.993
- And were they there this morning?
- Mon <i>Dieu!</i> I didn't even look!

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:53.621
I went to her bed, I saw Madame,
I cried out, and I ran out of the room.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.462
You did not even look!

01:24:56.550 --> 01:25:00.339
But I, Hercule Poirot,
have eyes which notice everything.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:04.843
The pearls were not on
the dressing table this morning.

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:08.388
They had gone. Vanished.

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:11.386
<i>Disparu.</i>

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.321
- We must find the gun.
- And the pearls.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:31.324
Yes, that should not prove
too difficult.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.794
<i>Oh, fé, f8! Q8'?! Fai!' Chase'!</i>

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:37.504
You're right.
Yes, I could do with a change of shirt.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:40.295
Yes, let's make a little pause
to freshen Ia toilette.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:47.090
- And to rest the little grey cells.
- I'll see you in five minutes.

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:19.170
<i>Oh, lá, lá!</i>

01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:39.501
I must thank you
for a most timely deliverance.

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:44.381
My pleasure. I heard your SOS. Do you
think it was put there deliberately?

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:45.965
Of course it was.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.131
But it will take more than a serpent

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:52.222
to interrupt the investigation
of Hercule Poirot.

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:57.391
How is the sleuthing going?
With eminence and discretion?

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:01.599
- No one to put the hand grips on?
- Not yet.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:04.894
Oh, er...

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:08.989
There is a dead cobra over there.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:12.451
Do me the kindness of having it removed,
please. Thank you very much.

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:16.573
- Come, Race.
- A cobra? Oh, cripes!

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:22.203
Never have I seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin. Never.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:34.510
Who's next? Pennington?
We know he's a wrong 'un.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.805
Oh, he's a dangerous one.

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:02.163
Monsieur Poirot, I presume?

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:05.545
<i>Excuse: moi, madame.</i>

01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:12.595
Perhaps you will permit us to join you?

01:29:12.722 --> 01:29:13.928
Of course.

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:18.008
Well?

01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:20.602
Your cabin is next to Madame Doyle's,
n'est pas?

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:21.686
It is.

01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:24.898
Did you hear anything strange
late last night?

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:28.439
I certainly did.
I am a very light sleeper.

01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:31.485
I was awakened by a popping sound.

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:33.198
A Popping sound?

01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:37.570
Exactly. Just like a champagne cork
coming out of a bottle.

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:41.407
An indifferent champagne,
you understand?

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:46.754
Not a great vintage.
That makes a much more discreet sound.

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:50.671
Could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork?

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:51.712
Very possibly.

01:29:51.845 --> 01:29:54.132
Though I'm sure you must appreciate

01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:58.428
that I have a minimal familiarity
with firearms.

01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:10.486
We have found it! We have found it!
Oh, goody, goody!

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:11.979
Oh. Goody, goody gumdrops!

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:21.118
This certainly takes the camel's hump.
Oh, yes! And no mistake! Gentlemen!

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:27.290
Gentlemen, I'm sure we have
found what you're looking for.

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:29.538
- Thank you, Mr Choudry.
- No mention.

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:41.683
Ah, without question,
the pistol of Mademoiselle Jackie.

01:30:45.315 --> 01:30:48.524
New Derringer .22, four shot.

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:50.188
Two bullets fired.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.736
A man's handkerchief. Looks like blood.

01:30:53.865 --> 01:30:57.278
And a marble ashtray
to send it to the bottom.

01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:00.653
- And my stole.
- This is yours, madam?

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:04.327
Well, of course it's mine.
I missed it last night in the saloon.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:09.203
The murderer wrapped it around the
pistol to deaden the noise of the shots.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:12.377
Impertinence! That stole was
given to me in Romania

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:15.001
by Crown Prince Carol himself.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:18.970
People are no respecters
of other people's property.

01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:22.012
Nor indeed of other people's jewellery.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:26.103
What can you be referring to, monsieur?

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:28.973
I'm referring to the Potsdam pearls,
madame!

01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:32.227
Which belong to Madame Doyle
and which have been abducted!

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:37.820
- Abducted?
- Dérobé. Purloined.

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:40.363
Pinched.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:46.662
And why are you looking at me
in that too-familiar, continental way?

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:49.000
What have these pearls to do with me?

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:55.045
Ah, I am the nasty
little eavesdropper, madame.

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.213
I heard that you much admire
these pearls.

01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:01.430
That you would give "every tooth
in your head to possess them".

01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:04.016
That bloody Bowers!

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:08.183
It is my theory that you have
an obsessive love of jewellery, madame,

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:11.102
that you coveted Madame
Doyle's pearis

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:17.776
and that you determined to possess them,
even if this meant robbery or murder.

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:21.366
You do not deny it, madame?

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:24.612
I can picture you walking the deck
last night,

01:32:24.748 --> 01:32:27.911
waiting for Madame Doyle to be asleep.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:29.033
<i>Go to bed!</i>

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:31.661
<i>Quite by chance,
you see the shooting in the saloon.</i>

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:33.707
- Jackie!
- I'll kill you first!

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.922
Jackie!

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:40.719
<i>When the mom is empty, you seize
the opportunity of taking the gun.</i>

01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:45.216
<i>You go to Madame Doyle's cabin,
knowing that her husband will not be there.</i>

01:32:53.818 --> 01:33:00.030
<i>You shoot her and then you take
the pearts from her bedside table.</i>

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:01.819
You will withdraw that!

01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:06.195
Or I shall prosecute you for slander
with the utmost vigour!

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:11.041
It will not equal the vigour
with which I shall search this boat,

01:33:11.169 --> 01:33:14.287
and in particular, your cabin, madame,
for those pearls.

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.787
I give you a good afternoon.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:22.136
- You perfectly foul French upstart!
- Belgian upstart, please, madame.

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:28.133
Was it necessary to be
so rough on the old lady?

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:30.101
You seem to be accusing everybody.

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:33.894
With reason, mon Colonel. What, you
think old ladies don't commit murder'?

01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:35.641
I am convinced she has the pearls.

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:38.735
The only question is,
did she kill to acquire them?

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:41.275
- Monsieur Choudry!
- Mamaba!

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.907
- Yes, Colonel?
- We will depart immediately.

01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:46.572
I've already given the orders.

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:49.571
At this very moment,
the engineer is building up steam.

01:33:51.918 --> 01:33:52.874
Why the sudden rush?

01:33:53.002 --> 01:33:56.461
I tell you, mon Dieu, I feel
the presence of evil all about me.

01:33:56.589 --> 01:33:58.921
The sooner we reach Wadi Halfa,
the better.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:00.916
I'll lock these up in a safe place.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:03.760
Then we must commence our search
for the pearls.

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:19.105
That's the last of the crew's cabins.
Maybe she threw them overboard.

01:34:20.405 --> 01:34:23.488
You forget that we have not yet
examined Pennington's cabin.

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:25.027
That's right. Let's do it now.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:29.575
Ahoy there!
So our journey is continuing.

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:31.413
Good afternoon, Madame.

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.075
Will you not join me
for a little refreshment?

01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:36.827
This marvellous little man here

01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:39.546
has just made me
the most extraordinary concoction

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:41.540
out of native fruit juices.

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.383
It's called a Golden Sobek,

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:47.470
and is named after the god of
the ancient city of Crocodilopolis.

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:49.260
Not for me, thank you very much.

01:34:49.392 --> 01:34:53.135
Sometimes I do take the hair of the dog,
but never the scale of the crocodile.

01:34:53.271 --> 01:34:54.306
Race!

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:57.181
And how are you getting along
with your investigation

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.399
of this tragic affair,
Monsieur Porridge?

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:02.895
Oh, norrnalement, madame.
Normally, as they say.

01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:07.616
Oh, the <i>crime</i> passionnel,
the primitive instinct to kill,

01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:10.202
so closely allied to the sex instinct.

01:35:11.414 --> 01:35:14.497
I have every sympathy
for that poor, half-crazed Jackie.

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:19.416
Her emotions are a turmoil,
her hot Latin blood raging

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:21.788
to be avenged
on the woman who stole her man.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:24.917
Yes, of course,
but it could have been someone else,

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.511
with a motive at least as good.

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:32.424
- Oh, who?
- You, Madame Otterbourne.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.097
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come, come.

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:37.767
Your daughter and you know
you cannot libel the dead.

01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:42.018
Now you will never have to pay
those huge damages she was asking for.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:44.941
- But one would hardly kill for that.
- Would one not'?

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:48.864
- Well?
- Another Golden What-Have-You.

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:53.782
You know, Mrs Otterbourne...

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:59.493
It is you that I can see looking
into the saloon through the windows

01:35:59.629 --> 01:36:01.540
at that, as you put it,

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:05.837
poor, half-crazed Jacqueline
shooting Monsieur Doyle.

01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:10.964
<i>And then, when everyone has gone,
running in to take up the gun,</i>

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:14.433
<i>and then stealing forth
to kill Madame Doyle.</i>

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.849
No! My world is the world of grand love
and passionate romance,

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:20.518
not grubby murders.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.482
Now, if you'll please leave me alone.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.568
Well, if we have disturbed you,
we are both desolate.

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:27.062
Life can be so cruel!

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:30.987
You must be brave, very brave,
to bear the calumnies of life.

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:38.540
Here, barman!
This crocodile has lost its "croc"!

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:45.004
What a perfectly dreadful woman. Why
doesn't somebody shoot her, I wonder?

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:48.046
Perhaps one day, the subscribers
of the lending libraries

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:51.010
will club together and hire an assassin.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:21.165
So, Madame Van Schuyler
is foolish enough

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:24.036
to play games with Hercule Poirot.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:27.540
You realise, of course, you have
no actual proof that she stole them.

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:31.009
The fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:34.801
that she did not kill
while stealing them in the first place.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.659
Pennington?

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:09.874
We must find that document he was
trying to induce Madame Doyle to sign.

01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:11.340
What's this?

01:38:11.469 --> 01:38:13.631
- Poirot.
- Yeah?

01:38:13.763 --> 01:38:16.721
Ho! Well, Mademoiselle Jackie
was not the only passenger

01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:19.762
- who was travelling armed.
- Still, Linnet Doyle was not shot

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:22.261
- with a thing this size.
- No, obviously not.

01:38:23.815 --> 01:38:26.933
<i>Oh, lá, lá, lá, lá, lá, lá!
Quelle pagaille!</i>

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:33.568
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Your eyes are better. Tell me.

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:39.285
What the hell is going on?

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:42.998
We're going through your private
papers, sir, isn't that obvious?

01:38:43.126 --> 01:38:44.582
You're what?

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:48.537
It may be the custom in Paris
to go through people's things,

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:49.913
but we're not in Paris now!

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:53.542
- Brussels, sir! The country <i>is...</i>
- I don't care if it's Borneo!

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:56.670
You have no right to be in my cabin,
no right at all!

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:58.467
We have every right.

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:02.684
The Company has commissioned us
to investigate this murder.

01:39:02.812 --> 01:39:05.349
Which has nothing to do with my papers!

01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:06.516
On the contrary.

01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:09.266
They prove that
in spite of Madame Doyle's marriage,

01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:12.144
you are still trying
to control her money.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:16.486
So what? There's no law against it.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:18.858
There is a law against
swindling your client,

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:21.783
and my people don't like
to see it contravened.

01:39:21.914 --> 01:39:23.655
Your people? Who the hell are they?

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:27.000
I represent Mrs Doyle's English lawyers.
We are not at all happy

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:30.541
about the way you and your partner
have been handling her affairs.

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:32.084
- Go to hell.
- Now look here...

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:35.425
- Her affairs are in perfect order.
- Oh, I wish that were true.

01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:36.884
I think you came over here

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:39.721
in order to get her signature
on this power of attorney.

01:39:39.849 --> 01:39:44.218
You failed and so you went
to the Temple of Amun...

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:48.479
<i>..and you climbed
to the top of the tall pillar.</i>

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:06.916
<i>There, you dislodged a stone which fell
and which namowly avoided killing her.</i>

01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:17.880
You can't pin that on me. Get out of
here! I've heard enough of this garbage.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:21.095
You may have to, one day,
listen to a little more of such garbage

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:24.182
from the lips of a public prosecutor.

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:27.769
Oh, this is yours, I believe.
Belgium.

01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:41.404
Let us change for dinner.
J'ai <i>faim.</i>

01:40:41.536 --> 01:40:44.198
- Poirot, you have a woman?
- Femme is woman.

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:46.412
J'ai <i>faim.</i> I am peckish.

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.497
Oh, I must have a word
with that little one.

01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.996
I will join you at the table,
mon Colonel.

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:56.748
Be good enough to order
me les moriffes.

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:59.751
<i>Les modifies? Oh, moray.</i>

01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:08.810
Well, how goes it with you,
ma petite?

01:41:09.855 --> 01:41:11.721
Badly, Monsieur Poirot.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:15.100
I feel so ashamed.

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:18.570
- His wife's dead, and...
- Now he's available to you again.

01:41:21.867 --> 01:41:24.780
Is it so wrong of me to hope
he'll come back?

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:28.871
I still love him.
And now he needs me more than ever.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.116
Oh, Monsieur Poirot, could <i>l..</i>

01:41:31.252 --> 01:41:35.246
Could you arrange for me to see him?
Just for five minutes. Please!

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:37.963
I don't see why not.

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:42.711
That is, if he wishes,
and the Herr Doctor raises no objection.

01:41:42.847 --> 01:41:44.713
I will make some inquiries.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.388
Ah, good! The temperature is down!

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:58.143
Alright, Herr Poirot. I've no objection,
provided the visit is short.

01:41:58.279 --> 01:42:00.987
- <i>Funf Minuten at the</i> most, <i>ja?</i>
- <i>Merci, docteun</i>

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:03.740
Mademoiselle Jackie!

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:08.244
- You can see him now.
- Oh, thank you!

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:12.865
- Hello, Jackie.
- Simon.

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:20.090
I'm very sorry about Linnet.

01:42:21.302 --> 01:42:23.589
- Thank you.
- Simon, I didn't kill her.

01:42:23.721 --> 01:42:26.383
- I swear that.
- You don't have to say it.

01:42:27.433 --> 01:42:28.764
I know.

01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:35.855
- Forgive me. Please.
- Jackie...

01:42:37.276 --> 01:42:40.439
Last night I was mad.
I might have killed you.

01:42:41.447 --> 01:42:43.939
What, with a rotten little peashooter
like that?

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.859
Will it be... Will you walk again?

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.281
Don't be a chump.

01:42:49.413 --> 01:42:51.154
As soon as we get to Wadi Halfa

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:54.123
they'll dig the damn thing out
and I'll be as right as rain.

01:42:54.251 --> 01:42:57.619
Ah, ja! Yeah!

01:42:57.755 --> 01:43:00.622
<i>Remember, fUnf Minuten, ja?</i>

01:43:01.967 --> 01:43:04.459
Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry!

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:08.213
There now.
There's nothing to apologise for.

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:30.068
<i>Qsfest-ce Que ciest que ga?</i>

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:33.613
I asked for a plate of morilles.

01:43:33.749 --> 01:43:36.457
- What's that when it's at home?
- Mushrooms.

01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:38.121
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:41.963
I thought you wanted a moray eel.
That's the best they could do.

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:44.708
- I've ordered you a new bottle of wine.
- Why?

01:43:44.844 --> 01:43:47.802
Last night's bottle was a little mouldy
when he poured it out.

01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:48.761
Mouldy?

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:50.755
Yes, you know,
it had a lot of bits in it.

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:55.476
But that's the normal sediment
for a great bottle of Chéteau Pétrus.

01:43:58.858 --> 01:44:00.724
- Will you join me in some?
- No, thanks.

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.147
You stick to your wine.
I'll stick to my whisky.

01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:06.397
You drink whisky all the... Wine...

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:11.284
Oh, how strange! Of course.

01:44:18.043 --> 01:44:20.284
May I?

01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:23.789
You know, Poirot, the way I see it,
everybody could have done it.

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:27.337
And everyone had a reason for doing it.
It's incredible.

01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:29.551
<i>Absolument.</i>

01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:33.840
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.563
Good evening, madam. Please.

01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:28.068
Come quick. Quick.

01:45:44.088 --> 01:45:46.079
- Fetch Dr Bessner.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:53.302
You see what this is?

01:45:55.766 --> 01:46:00.852
Money. Looks like a piece of a thousand
franc note. It has to be blackmail.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:04.098
She must have known something
about Linnet Doyle's murderer.

01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:09.231
What idiots we have been!

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:12.063
<i>Ah, non de non!</i>

01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:16.617
What did she say this afternoon?

01:46:16.745 --> 01:46:22.661
"If I had been unable to sleep,
if I had stayed on deck,

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:24.283
I could then, perhaps,

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:28.584
have seen the assassin enter
or leave Madame Doyle's cabin."

01:46:30.175 --> 01:46:33.338
But that is precisely what happened.
She did see the assassin!

01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:36.303
And it's because of her greed
that she now lies dead!

01:46:36.432 --> 01:46:40.892
Much good that does us. We still
don't know who killed either woman!

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.728
No, no, no, that's not quite right.

01:46:43.856 --> 01:46:47.269
You see, we have been running
in the wrong direction, you and I.

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:50.939
We know almost all there is to know...

01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:55.398
...except that what we know seems...

01:46:56.535 --> 01:46:58.025
...seems incredible.

01:46:59.914 --> 01:47:01.029
Impossible.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.913
Ah, killings.

01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:10.505
Killings! All the time, killings!

01:47:11.884 --> 01:47:13.215
<i>Ja.</i>

01:47:14.386 --> 01:47:16.423
Dead no more than an hour.

01:47:17.932 --> 01:47:19.889
The throat's been cut...

01:47:21.602 --> 01:47:23.559
...with a very thin knife.

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.356
One like this.

01:47:30.402 --> 01:47:32.063
That's very interesting, doctor.

01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:34.984
Are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing?

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:36.355
<i>Was?</i>

01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:41.786
So now you think that I,
Ludwig Bessner,

01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:44.747
have killed this miserable
little femme de chambre?

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:47.416
<i>Oh, Gott im Himmell</i>

01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:51.378
What do I have to do with the squalid
affairs of the lower classes?

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:57.294
It is well known they do not have
neuroses, just animal passions!

01:48:03.936 --> 01:48:06.303
- Take the body to the ice room.
- Yes, sir.

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:10.731
So you think you know, huh?

01:48:10.859 --> 01:48:13.191
I must confess,
I don't see any real light myself.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.187
Dr Bessner has just told me
what's happened to the maid.

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:19.907
I must speak with you
and Mr Doyle at once.

01:48:20.995 --> 01:48:23.453
I wouldn't go in there.
Dr Bessner is rather cross.

01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:27.665
My good man, I know that. But a little
Kraut crossness won't stop me now.

01:48:27.793 --> 01:48:29.329
You see, I know.

01:48:30.963 --> 01:48:33.876
Mr Doyle, I know who
killed Louise Bourget.

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:36.966
What? You say you know
who killed Louise?

01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:39.552
Ah, ja, net to shout!

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.547
And you, Frau Otterbourne,
you cannot be here. I forbid it.

01:48:42.683 --> 01:48:43.844
My patient is resting.

01:48:43.976 --> 01:48:46.138
But I must! You see,
it's vitally important!

01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:48.056
You see, I know all. All, I tell you!

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:51.556
Now, look, I will not take
that pushing with Ellbogen.

01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:54.480
Mr Doyle, I tell you that I,
Salome Otterbourne,

01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:56.898
have succeeded
where frail men have faltered.

01:48:57.031 --> 01:48:59.864
I am a finer sleuth
than even the great Hercule Porridge.

01:48:59.992 --> 01:49:03.986
Mrs Otterbourne,
for God's sake, calm down!

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:06.863
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

01:49:07.833 --> 01:49:10.916
- I refuse to speak in front of him.
- Now you will not speak at all.

01:49:11.045 --> 01:49:14.629
New, rants, raus. His temperature is
rising with all this disturbance.

01:49:14.757 --> 01:49:17.920
Doctor, it will rise even more
if we don't hear what she has to say.

01:49:18.052 --> 01:49:18.837
Herr Doyle...

01:49:18.969 --> 01:49:22.303
We are talking about
the murderer of my wife!

01:49:22.431 --> 01:49:24.672
Oh, ja. Ja, alright.

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:28.221
<i>You can stay drei Minuten.</i>
Three <i>minutes.</i>

01:49:28.353 --> 01:49:31.095
And you, now, you speak softly, eh?

01:49:36.653 --> 01:49:38.610
Odious little man!

01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:42.983
Madam, do I understand that you have
evidence to show who killed Mrs Doyle?

01:49:43.118 --> 01:49:46.076
You do and I have.

01:49:46.205 --> 01:49:48.071
You will agree, will you not,

01:49:48.207 --> 01:49:52.872
that whoever killed Louise Bourget
also killed Linnet Doyle.

01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:55.961
- That is quite possible.
- Well...

01:49:57.216 --> 01:50:02.177
I saw who killed Louise Bourget
with my own eyes.

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.597
Pray continue, madame.

01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:14.063
I happened to be in the stern
of the boat talking to one of the crew,

01:50:14.191 --> 01:50:16.774
<i>who was showing me
a most intriguing sight.</i>

01:50:16.902 --> 01:50:21.521
<i>A buffalo and a camel, yoked together,
tilling the soil.</i>

01:50:21.657 --> 01:50:24.991
You saw this by moonlight,
of course, madame?

01:50:26.662 --> 01:50:30.326
Yes, I did.
I have amazingly good eyesight.

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:32.786
Anyway, I left him.

01:50:32.918 --> 01:50:37.207
<i>And suddenly, as I rounded the corner,
I heard a scream.</i>

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.708
<i>It came from Louise Bourget's cabin.</i>

01:50:41.844 --> 01:50:44.131
<i>Then I saw the cabin door open.</i>

01:50:44.263 --> 01:50:48.006
<i>As the door opened wider,
I saw that it was...</i>

01:51:06.451 --> 01:51:08.067
Pennington's.

01:51:22.259 --> 01:51:25.422
I heard a big boom!
What now has happened?

01:51:25.554 --> 01:51:27.465
Mrs Otterbourne's been shot.

01:51:33.979 --> 01:51:35.344
- Mr Pennington?
- Yes?

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.767
This is your gun, I believe.

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:41.359
Anybody could have taken that gun.
Everybody knew it was there.

01:51:41.486 --> 01:51:44.649
I was saying just the other night,
I always can? A gun abroad.

01:51:44.781 --> 01:51:47.694
It is time for these murders to stop.

01:51:47.826 --> 01:51:49.942
I have, unfortunately,
delayed too long.

01:51:50.078 --> 01:51:54.037
I would like to see everybody,
please, in the saloon,

01:51:54.166 --> 01:51:56.578
when all will be revealed.

01:51:56.710 --> 01:52:01.045
In, er... 30 minutes?

01:52:07.596 --> 01:52:11.931
I can't believe it. Mother dead.

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:13.299
Why?

01:52:14.353 --> 01:52:19.189
- She must have found something out.
- Oh, God! Poor darling!

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:21.648
I loved her, in spite of it all.

01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:24.735
And now she's gone.

01:52:26.281 --> 01:52:28.067
I can't take it in.

01:52:29.117 --> 01:52:30.573
Suddenly I'm...

01:52:31.745 --> 01:52:33.076
All alone.

01:52:35.374 --> 01:52:36.739
No, you're not.

01:52:38.043 --> 01:52:39.579
I'll look after you.

01:52:41.046 --> 01:52:42.787
<i>Oh, Jim...</i>

01:52:44.675 --> 01:52:46.461
Poor Mother.

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:50.552
You'd never have got away from her.
Not while she was alive.

01:53:14.329 --> 01:53:20.701
<i>Mesdames, mademoiselles, messieurs.
The game is over.</i>

01:53:20.836 --> 01:53:24.295
I, Hercule Poirot, now know,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

01:53:24.423 --> 01:53:29.793
who killed Madame Doyle, Louise Bourget
and Madame Otterbourne.

01:53:29.928 --> 01:53:33.216
Foolishly, I began this investigation
with the preconceived idea

01:53:33.348 --> 01:53:35.089
that there must have been a witness

01:53:35.225 --> 01:53:39.560
to the shooting scene between
Mademoiselle Jackie and Simon Doyle.

01:53:40.772 --> 01:53:44.731
That this person must have taken
the gun from here,

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.773
after everyone had left the saloon,

01:53:47.904 --> 01:53:50.236
and must have used it
to kill Madame Doyle

01:53:50.365 --> 01:53:54.324
and to attempt to frame
Mademoiselle Jackie.

01:53:54.453 --> 01:53:55.568
<i>You see, mes amis,</i>

01:53:55.704 --> 01:54:00.289
it is not as though there were
any lack of suspects among you.

01:54:00.417 --> 01:54:04.877
She might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth.

01:54:05.005 --> 01:54:08.714
Or by someone whose father had been
ruined by Madame Doyle's father.

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:12.426
Or by someone obsessed
with the idea of robbery.

01:54:12.554 --> 01:54:17.219
Or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money.

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:20.844
Or by someone who was desperately
trying to save her mother

01:54:20.979 --> 01:54:23.892
from financial ruin.

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:25.435
Or yet,

01:54:25.567 --> 01:54:30.482
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee.

01:54:31.823 --> 01:54:36.067
Or by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim.

01:54:42.292 --> 01:54:47.128
And then I remembered
something very important.

01:54:47.255 --> 01:54:49.371
<i>On the night of the killing,
I slept heavily,</i>

01:54:49.508 --> 01:54:52.375
<i>not lightly, as is my custom.
Why?</i>

01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:56.212
<i>Because my wine had been drugged</i>

01:54:56.348 --> 01:55:01.934
<i>by someone who did not wish me to be
present at the night's events.</i>

01:55:02.062 --> 01:55:07.023
<i>It was the easiest thing in the world.
The bottles stand open all daylong.</i>

01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:09.767
<i>You, mon Colonel,
you even sent the bottle back,</i>

01:55:09.903 --> 01:55:13.612
<i>saying, to use your words,
that it was "mouldy".</i>

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:19.531
<i>And this in itself plainly implies
premeditation on someonek's part.</i>

01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:23.406
It means that yesterday before 7:30 p.m.,
when dinner was served,

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:27.080
the crime had already been decided upon.

01:55:27.212 --> 01:55:30.955
I began to think on something that has
been puzzling me from the beginning.

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:34.755
If the intention was to implicate
Mademoiselle Jackie,

01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:38.424
why had the gun been removed
from Madame Doyle's cabin?

01:55:38.557 --> 01:55:40.389
And then I understood.

01:55:40.517 --> 01:55:45.728
The murderer had removed the gun
because he, or she, had to remove it.

01:55:45.856 --> 01:55:49.520
There was no other course.
And there was more.

01:55:51.027 --> 01:55:54.895
Dr Bessner,
you examined Madame Doyle's body.

01:55:57.284 --> 01:55:58.240
<i>Ja.</i>

01:55:59.202 --> 01:56:02.911
You will remember that there were
signs of scorching round the wound.

01:56:03.039 --> 01:56:03.824
<i>In other words,</i>

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:07.495
<i>the gun had been placed very close
to her head before being fired.</i>

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:08.833
That is correct.

01:56:10.088 --> 01:56:13.206
But when we recovered
the gun from the Nile,

01:56:13.341 --> 01:56:16.754
it was wrapped in this
brocade stole

01:56:16.887 --> 01:56:19.925
and had evidently been fired
through its folds,

01:56:20.056 --> 01:56:23.720
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot.

01:56:23.852 --> 01:56:28.722
Dr Bessner, if it had been fired
through the stole,

01:56:28.857 --> 01:56:32.691
there would have been no scorching
on Madame Doyle's temple.

01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:37.938
In other words, the shot that killed
Madame Doyle could not have been fired

01:56:38.074 --> 01:56:40.190
through the stole.

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:42.238
And then, perhaps,
it was the other one.

01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:45.453
The one which Jacqueline
de Bellefort fired at Simon Doyle.

01:56:45.582 --> 01:56:47.949
Jackie!

01:56:49.377 --> 01:56:52.540
<i>But no, we have a witness for that.
We know it's not so.</i>

01:56:54.090 --> 01:56:57.333
Therefore, there was a third shot.

01:57:00.514 --> 01:57:03.131
One of which we know nothing.

01:57:05.018 --> 01:57:10.934
But... there were only two shots
missing from the gun.

01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:25.911
The next curious circumstance occurred
in Madame Doyle's cabin.

01:57:27.082 --> 01:57:30.165
<i>In it I found two bottles
of coloured nail polish.</i>

01:57:30.293 --> 01:57:35.163
<i>One bottle was labelled "Rose", but
the few drops remaining in that bottle</i>

01:57:35.298 --> 01:57:37.960
<i>were not pale pink,
but bright red.</i>

01:57:38.093 --> 01:57:42.553
<i>And instead of the usual smell
of pear drops, vinegar.</i>

01:57:43.974 --> 01:57:50.141
Mes <i>amis,</i> it was red ink,
which formed an inevitable link

01:57:50.272 --> 01:57:53.606
with this handkerchief
which we found

01:57:53.733 --> 01:57:56.896
together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole.

01:57:57.028 --> 01:58:01.613
And ink washes easily out of linen,
leaving a pale pink stain.

01:58:03.118 --> 01:58:08.363
Then something happened which put
the matter beyond all doubt.

01:58:09.541 --> 01:58:15.207
Louise Bourget was killed because
she was blackmailing the murderer.

01:58:15.338 --> 01:58:19.878
We know this not only because of
the fragment of a thousand franc note

01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:24.049
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers,

01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:28.970
but also because of some
rather curious words she used

01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:31.218
only this morning.

01:58:31.354 --> 01:58:34.312
Naturally,
if I'd been unable to sleep...

01:58:34.441 --> 01:58:38.059
<i>Naturally, if I had
been unable to sleep,</i>

01:58:38.194 --> 01:58:39.901
<i>if I had stayed on deck,</i>

01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:45.867
<i>I might then perhaps have seen the
assassin enter or leave madames cabin.</i>

01:58:47.662 --> 01:58:50.529
Now, what exactly did that tell us?

01:58:52.375 --> 01:58:58.371
What exactly did she tell
us with that?

01:59:00.675 --> 01:59:04.589
That she had stayed on deck.
She did see the murderer.

01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:08.464
Yes, but you still fail to see
my point, mon Colonel, excuse me.

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.719
- Why did she say that to us?
- As a hint?

01:59:12.854 --> 01:59:16.188
As a hint, of course,
but why hint to us?

01:59:17.692 --> 01:59:20.980
She knows who the murderer is.
Alright, she can do one of two things.

01:59:21.112 --> 01:59:23.774
She can tell us
or else she can keep quiet

01:59:23.907 --> 01:59:27.445
and demand money
from the person concerned later.

01:59:27.577 --> 01:59:29.534
But she does
neither of these two things.

01:59:29.663 --> 01:59:33.782
She uses the conditional tense,
if you please. "If I had been."

01:59:33.917 --> 01:59:35.282
This can mean only one thing.

01:59:35.418 --> 01:59:40.254
She's hinting, alright, yes,
but she's hinting to the murderer.

01:59:40.382 --> 01:59:43.124
In other words,
he was present at the time.

01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:51.516
But apart from you and me,
only one other person was present.

01:59:51.643 --> 01:59:54.351
Precisely. Simon Doyle.

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:58.187
What?

02:00:03.405 --> 02:00:06.488
Yes. You are under the constant
supervision of Dr Bessner.

02:00:06.616 --> 02:00:09.529
She had to speak then.
She might not have got another chance.

02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:13.029
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
- I don't think I'm being ridiculous.

02:00:13.164 --> 02:00:16.953
I remember very clearly your answer.
"I will look after you."

02:00:17.085 --> 02:00:19.998
"No one is accusing you of anything."

02:00:20.130 --> 02:00:24.920
This is exactly the assurance
that she wanted, and which she got.

02:00:29.389 --> 02:00:34.225
Oh, Mr P, you really have made a fool
of yourself this time, and no mistake.

02:00:34.352 --> 02:00:37.890
I've got plenty of witnesses to prove
that I couldn't have killed Linnet.

02:00:38.022 --> 02:00:39.262
I know you have.

02:00:40.316 --> 02:00:44.560
But you did kill her
and Louise Bourget saw you.

02:00:44.696 --> 02:00:46.687
Oh, what nonsense!

02:00:46.823 --> 02:00:48.279
I tell you that Herr Doyle

02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:51.446
could not have moved about the boat
with a fractured leg.

02:00:51.578 --> 02:00:53.444
I tell you that I, Ludwig Bessner,

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.867
would testify to this
to any court in the world.

02:00:55.999 --> 02:00:59.492
In that case, I would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant.

02:01:00.462 --> 02:01:04.706
<i>- Irrelevant?
- Unanwendbar.</i>

02:01:04.841 --> 02:01:08.755
<i>Unanwendbar? Me?</i>

02:01:10.638 --> 02:01:12.379
I have testified

02:01:12.515 --> 02:01:16.429
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century.

02:01:16.561 --> 02:01:19.269
My testimony alone saved
Strutzrumple,

02:01:19.397 --> 02:01:23.186
the Dresden Sachertorte Murderer,
from execution.

02:01:23.318 --> 02:01:24.979
- And in the case...
- Calmez vous.

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:29.230
Your testimony is irrelevant because
you started to tend to Monsieur Doyle

02:01:29.365 --> 02:01:31.697
five minutes after he had been shot.

02:01:31.826 --> 02:01:35.490
But I tell you he could not have
moved during those five minutes.

02:01:35.622 --> 02:01:38.535
I agree, if he'd been shot at
that time, but had he been?

02:01:40.543 --> 02:01:44.286
Consider what had actually
been seen.

02:01:44.422 --> 02:01:48.256
<i>Mademoiselle Rosalie saw
Jacqueline fire her pistol.</i>

02:01:48.384 --> 02:01:52.799
<i>She saw Doyle collapse to the ﬂoor,
and then turning away to seek help,</i>

02:01:52.931 --> 02:01:56.049
<i>she ran into Monsieur Ferguson,
who had heard the shot.</i>

02:01:57.018 --> 02:02:01.808
<i>All he saw was Doyle clutching
a red-stained handkerchief to his leg.</i>

02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:04.978
<i>He quite naturally assumed
that Doyle had been shot,</i>

02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:07.771
<i>but the assumption was wrong.</i>

02:02:07.904 --> 02:02:12.148
<i>The bullet had not gone into Doyle,
but elsewhere.</i>

02:02:12.283 --> 02:02:13.990
<i>And now what happens?</i>

02:02:14.118 --> 02:02:19.454
<i>Doyle insists that Jackie be taken away
to her cabin and not be left alone.</i>

02:02:20.917 --> 02:02:22.954
<i>And so Jackie is helped
to her cabin</i>

02:02:23.086 --> 02:02:25.623
<i>by Mademoiselle Rosalie
and Monsieur Ferguson.</i>

02:02:25.755 --> 02:02:30.420
<i>Then, Mademoiselle Rosalie
goes to fetch Miss Bowers.</i>

02:02:31.636 --> 02:02:33.673
<i>Accordingly,
all the activity is centred</i>

02:02:33.805 --> 02:02:35.762
<i>on the starboard side
of the boat.</i>

02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:36.800
Miss Bowers!

02:02:48.695 --> 02:02:51.778
<i>Two minutes are all
that Doyle needs.</i>

02:02:51.906 --> 02:02:55.570
<i>He takes of? His shoes,</i>
<i>picks up the gun from under the sofa,</i>

02:02:55.702 --> 02:02:57.659
<i>where Jackie had
thoughtfully thrown it</i>

02:02:57.787 --> 02:02:59.949
<i>so that it would be forgotten
until later,</i>

02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:03.039
<i>and runs like a hare
along the port deck.</i>

02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:07.040
<i>He then enters his wife's cabin.</i>

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:55.209
<i>Doyle then takes Madame Van Schuyler's
stole which he had previously hidden,</i>

02:03:55.345 --> 02:03:57.131
<i>and wrapping up the gun in it</i>

02:03:57.263 --> 02:04:01.097
<i>in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching,</i>

02:04:01.225 --> 02:04:04.593
<i>fires a bullet into his own leg.</i>

02:04:15.198 --> 02:04:20.534
<i>He removes one of the spent cartridges,
which he disposes of,</i>

02:04:20.662 --> 02:04:25.156
<i>and inserts a fresh one, thus
indicating, should the gun be found,</i>

02:04:25.291 --> 02:04:28.829
<i>that only two bullets
had been fired from it.</i>

02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:47.515
<i>He then rewraps the gun in the stole,
adds the stained handkerchief</i>

02:04:47.647 --> 02:04:51.982
<i>and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom,</i>

02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:55.944
<i>and throws the whole bundle
out of the window into the Nile.</i>

02:04:56.072 --> 02:04:58.905
<i>And now he lies back
on the sofa,</i>

02:04:59.033 --> 02:05:02.867
<i>clasping a fresh handkerchief
to his leg,</i>

02:05:02.996 --> 02:05:05.909
<i>this time in genuine agony.</i>

02:05:14.882 --> 02:05:17.544
<i>[C'est extraordinaire,
n'est pas?</i>

02:05:17.677 --> 02:05:20.465
It's impossible.
I can scarcely believe it.

02:05:20.596 --> 02:05:23.304
Of course it is,
absolutely bloody impossible.

02:05:23.433 --> 02:05:25.015
Why do you say it's impossible?

02:05:25.143 --> 02:05:27.885
You yourself told me
that you heard softly running feet.

02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:30.103
What reason was there for
anyone to run?

02:05:30.231 --> 02:05:32.973
Yes, I know, but to do all that
on the spur of the moment?

02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:36.318
Once and for all, mon Colonel,
it was not on the spur of the moment,

02:05:36.446 --> 02:05:38.813
it was carefully planned.

02:05:38.948 --> 02:05:42.441
- By Doyle?
- Oh, Doyle. He merely acted the part.

02:05:42.577 --> 02:05:47.913
It was planned by his accomplice,
Mademoiselle Jacqueline de Bellefort.

02:05:51.502 --> 02:05:53.459
You must be mad.

02:05:54.505 --> 02:05:57.998
No, I'm not mad.
That's the truth.

02:05:59.135 --> 02:06:04.130
Who gave Doyle his alibi?
You did, by firing that shot.

02:06:05.099 --> 02:06:07.841
And who gave you your alibi?

02:06:07.977 --> 02:06:13.313
Doyle, by insistingb that
someone stay with you all night.

02:06:13.441 --> 02:06:16.183
It's not true! It's not!

02:06:16.319 --> 02:06:19.277
It is true. Why bother to deny it?

02:06:20.698 --> 02:06:25.443
You and Doyle were lovers.
You still are lovers.

02:06:25.578 --> 02:06:28.787
The plan was that Simon would kill
his wife, inherit the money,

02:06:28.915 --> 02:06:34.285
and then aftewvards, at some later date,
marry his old love.

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:37.333
It was a very brilliant concept.

02:06:37.465 --> 02:06:41.959
Your persecution of Madame Doyle,
Simon's feigned rage,

02:06:42.095 --> 02:06:45.463
your selection of Mademoiselle Rosalie
as a witness,

02:06:45.598 --> 02:06:50.217
and all that build-up to the shooting,
the exaggerated hysteria...

02:06:51.354 --> 02:06:53.812
There was only one risk
you really took.

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:58.025
And that was that Simon's wound
simply had to be disabling.

02:06:58.152 --> 02:07:02.362
Oh, and, er, pardon me,
but one piece of foolishness,

02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:07.530
which was the drawing of the letter "J"
on the wall of the cabin,

02:07:07.662 --> 02:07:09.903
so melodramatic it could only have
one effect.

02:07:10.039 --> 02:07:11.996
That of exonerating you.

02:07:12.125 --> 02:07:17.211
And who would want to do that
except an accomplice?

02:07:18.673 --> 02:07:25.090
But then... the plan began
to go wrong, did it not?

02:07:25.221 --> 02:07:27.838
<i>Louise Bourget has
been wakeful.</i>

02:07:27.974 --> 02:07:31.057
<i>She sees Doyle
run into his wife's cabin.</i>

02:07:32.436 --> 02:07:36.430
<i>She hears the shot and sees
him return to the saloon.</i>

02:07:38.693 --> 02:07:41.526
<i>She makes her greedy bid
for hush money</i>

02:07:41.654 --> 02:07:45.113
<i>and in doing so,
signs her own death wanant.</i>

02:07:46.242 --> 02:07:50.406
Herr Doyle could not have killed her,
because he could not have moved.

02:07:50.538 --> 02:07:53.326
- I will swear to that.
- You would be right.

02:07:54.292 --> 02:07:56.408
She was killed by Mademoiselle Jackie.

02:07:59.255 --> 02:08:01.166
No!

02:08:01.299 --> 02:08:04.087
Yes, I am afraid there is no doubt.

02:08:04.218 --> 02:08:07.711
Just before dinner,
she asked to see Monsieur Doyle.

02:08:07.847 --> 02:08:12.432
<i>Quite foolishly, as it tums out,
I agreed and brought them together.</i>

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:17.350
<i>The one apparently guilt-ridden
and distraught, the other comforting.</i>

02:08:17.481 --> 02:08:19.597
Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry.

02:08:19.734 --> 02:08:21.099
There, now.

02:08:21.235 --> 02:08:25.900
<i>However, I'm sure as soon as
we've gone, the tone changes.</i>

02:08:26.991 --> 02:08:29.358
It's going fine, darling.
We're nearly there.

02:08:29.493 --> 02:08:32.281
Like hell it is! Louise knows.

02:08:32.413 --> 02:08:35.531
She saw me.
She's trying to blackmail us.

02:08:37.126 --> 02:08:38.833
I'll have to shut her up.

02:08:40.755 --> 02:08:43.747
- Can't we pay her'?
- All our lives?

02:08:45.009 --> 02:08:46.499
Jackie, are you sure?

02:08:57.563 --> 02:09:00.476
- Give me some money.
- Why?

02:09:00.608 --> 02:09:03.976
That's what she's waiting for.
It'll put her off guard. Where is it?

02:09:04.111 --> 02:09:05.647
In my jacket. In the wardrobe.

02:09:23.339 --> 02:09:25.296
- I love you.
- I know.

02:09:26.342 --> 02:09:27.298
Are we insane?

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.667
Oh, I don't know,
but we can't stop now.

02:09:31.555 --> 02:09:32.886
Jackie...

02:09:34.892 --> 02:09:36.508
Wish me luck.

02:09:49.407 --> 02:09:51.774
<i>Unfortunately for her,
in her haste,</i>

02:09:51.909 --> 02:09:55.527
<i>she leaves a tiny fragment
of a thousand franc note behind</i>

02:09:55.663 --> 02:09:57.779
<i>clutched in the dead
woman's fingers.</i>

02:09:57.915 --> 02:10:00.122
<i>But even more unfortunately,</i>

02:10:00.251 --> 02:10:03.494
<i>she is seen by Madame Otterbourne
leaving the cabin.</i>

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:06.212
<i>She is unaware of this at the time,</i>

02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:10.834
<i>and returns to Dr Bessner's cabin
to replace the scalpel.</i>

02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:16.181
<i>Then, having changed for dinner,
somewhat ﬂushed and out of breath,</i>

02:10:16.309 --> 02:10:18.846
<i>she hurries into the dining mom.</i>

02:10:19.937 --> 02:10:21.598
As for Madame Otterbourne,

02:10:21.731 --> 02:10:26.692
when she hears of the murder
of Louise Bourget from Dr Bessner,

02:10:26.819 --> 02:10:30.062
she suddenly realises that she has
actually seen the murderer

02:10:30.197 --> 02:10:32.359
leaving the scene of the crime.

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:35.574
What? You say you know
who killed Louise?

02:10:35.703 --> 02:10:37.410
Calm. Not to shout.

02:10:37.538 --> 02:10:40.280
And you, Frau,
you cannot be here. I forbid it!

02:10:40.416 --> 02:10:42.498
<i>It seemed strange to me
at the time</i>

02:10:42.626 --> 02:10:46.540
<i>that Doyle should be shouting
so loudly at Madame Otterbourne.</i>

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:48.959
<i>Now, of course,
I realise that what he was doing</i>

02:10:49.091 --> 02:10:51.298
<i>was shouting a warning to Jackie
next door.</i>

02:10:51.427 --> 02:10:55.091
Mrs Otterbourne, for God's sake,
calm down.

02:10:55.222 --> 02:10:58.010
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

02:10:58.142 --> 02:11:02.852
<i>And why did he ask her to start at
the beginning and tell the whole story?</i>

02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:07.770
<i>Obviously, to give Jackie time to act,
which she did, like lightning.</i>

02:11:07.902 --> 02:11:09.438
Herr Doyle...

02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:12.813
We are talking about
the murderer of my wife!

02:11:17.495 --> 02:11:19.031
Mr Pennington?

02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:36.094
<i>She boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot</i>

02:11:36.222 --> 02:11:38.714
<i>and her boast was not an idle one.</i>

02:11:38.849 --> 02:11:40.214
I saw it...

02:11:42.812 --> 02:11:46.350
<i>She dropped the gun and
bolted into her own cabin next door.</i>

02:11:46.482 --> 02:11:52.148
<i>It was highly risky,
but it was her only possible chance.</i>

02:11:57.201 --> 02:12:00.410
<i>Voila, mes amis.</i>
That is all.

02:12:07.294 --> 02:12:11.663
Congratulations, Mr P,
on a highly amusing theory.

02:12:11.799 --> 02:12:13.585
Oh, it's more than a theory.

02:12:14.552 --> 02:12:17.920
Unfortunately, it is the truth.

02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:23.971
Then what happened to the first bullet?
The one that Jackie fired at me?

02:12:24.103 --> 02:12:28.142
Oh, that's a good question, yes.
Can you all see this table?

02:12:28.274 --> 02:12:31.232
There's a newly-made bullet hole,
just there.

02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:37.072
Of course, you had time to dispose of
the bullet and throw it into the Nile.

02:12:37.199 --> 02:12:40.157
- What pifﬂe!
- Oh, no. It's not pifﬂe.

02:12:40.286 --> 02:12:41.447
Remember, we have proof

02:12:41.579 --> 02:12:44.788
that all three bullets came
from Mademoiselle Jacqueline's gun.

02:12:44.915 --> 02:12:46.826
Suppose that's true, Monsieur Poirot,

02:12:46.959 --> 02:12:49.371
where's the proof
that Simon fired the other two?

02:12:49.503 --> 02:12:53.371
Well, that's right! You've no proof.

02:12:53.507 --> 02:12:55.794
You've absolutely no proof at all.

02:12:55.926 --> 02:12:58.839
We'll produce some, never fear.
You won't get away with this.

02:12:58.971 --> 02:13:03.010
No? Well, you'll never convince
a jury without proof.

02:13:04.268 --> 02:13:08.432
And where do you intend to get it, Mr P?
From Linnet?

02:13:09.607 --> 02:13:12.019
Oh, no. Not from Linnet.

02:13:13.903 --> 02:13:14.938
From you.

02:13:16.864 --> 02:13:19.777
- From me? What do you mean?
- It's a bluff, Simon.

02:13:19.909 --> 02:13:22.321
It's very far from being a bluff.

02:13:22.453 --> 02:13:23.989
There is a very simple test

02:13:24.121 --> 02:13:27.614
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world.

02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:29.991
It's called a moulage test.

02:13:31.754 --> 02:13:34.121
- “Moulage test"?
- Yes, moulage.

02:13:34.256 --> 02:13:36.247
You know, when you fire a gun

02:13:36.383 --> 02:13:39.671
tiny grains of powder become embedded
in the skin

02:13:39.803 --> 02:13:44.047
and they can now be removed
by a thin layer of wax.

02:13:44.183 --> 02:13:46.720
That's a moulage test.

02:13:48.896 --> 02:13:51.388
Oh, mon Colonel,
will you administer this?

02:13:51.524 --> 02:13:53.765
When you wish.

02:13:55.778 --> 02:13:58.987
I assume, of course, that you're
willing to submit to such a test?

02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:04.609
There is no pain involved,
just a little... warmth.

02:14:16.465 --> 02:14:17.500
Jackie, what...

02:14:19.593 --> 02:14:21.129
What can we do?

02:14:29.061 --> 02:14:32.645
Nothing. It's over.

02:14:41.615 --> 02:14:44.027
I don't mind so much, monsieur.

02:14:44.159 --> 02:14:46.617
About me, I mean.

02:14:46.745 --> 02:14:48.611
You do mind, don't you? A bit?

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:54.125
- Yes.
- And don't judge Simon too harshly.

02:14:54.253 --> 02:14:55.414
He never had any money

02:14:55.546 --> 02:15:00.040
and Linnet simply dazzled him
with all that wealth.

02:15:00.175 --> 02:15:03.293
Simon, do you remember what you said?

02:15:04.346 --> 02:15:06.132
I said if this was a book,

02:15:06.265 --> 02:15:09.929
I'd marry Linnet and she'd die
within a year and leave me everything.

02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:12.802
That's when I saw the idea
come into his head.

02:15:12.938 --> 02:15:16.556
I was terrified. I knew
he'd try some perfectly absurd way.

02:15:16.692 --> 02:15:19.400
He even had the idea
of putting a cobra in her bed.

02:15:20.988 --> 02:15:24.356
Well, you found another use
for that serpent, mademoiselle.

02:15:27.036 --> 02:15:28.902
I'm glad it didn't kill you, monsieur.

02:15:29.038 --> 02:15:31.245
-- Truly,

02:15:34.835 --> 02:15:35.870
So you...

02:15:37.463 --> 02:15:38.749
<i>You see...</i>

02:15:40.049 --> 02:15:41.631
...I had to help him.

02:15:43.761 --> 02:15:45.798
I've always had to help him.

02:15:47.556 --> 02:15:49.172
Oh, Jackie, I love you.

02:15:50.517 --> 02:15:51.552
I love you.

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:00.224
Stop!

02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:06.776
Monsieur Poirot.

02:16:19.922 --> 02:16:21.708
<i>Quelle tragédie.</i>

02:16:37.606 --> 02:16:40.724
A splendid piece of detection,
Poirot, I must say.

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:44.522
You know, I couldn't possibly have
carried out that moulage test.

02:16:44.655 --> 02:16:46.191
I have no wax.

02:16:46.323 --> 02:16:49.986
You astonish me, mon Colonel.
You absolutely astonish me.

02:16:53.163 --> 02:16:55.780
Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.

02:16:55.915 --> 02:16:57.998
I'm afraid the description
of your cases

02:16:58.127 --> 02:17:00.584
will have to wait until another time.

02:17:00.713 --> 02:17:02.329
<i>Oh, quel dommage, madame!</i>

02:17:02.464 --> 02:17:05.798
I was hoping to recount to you
my recent extraordinary experience

02:17:05.925 --> 02:17:08.884
on the Orient Express.

02:17:09.012 --> 02:17:11.093
Come on, Bowers. Time to go.

02:17:11.223 --> 02:17:15.387
This place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary.

02:17:15.519 --> 02:17:18.887
Thank God, you'll be in one yourself
before too long.

02:17:19.022 --> 02:17:21.638
- Bloody old fossil.
- Temper, temper, Bowers!

02:17:21.775 --> 02:17:24.392
What you need is a nice cool holiday.

02:17:24.528 --> 02:17:29.022
I was thinking of a trip
through the Gobi Desert.

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:35.366
Monsieur Poirot,
I wanted you to be the first to know.

02:17:35.496 --> 02:17:36.736
We've just got engaged.

02:17:36.874 --> 02:17:39.161
<i>Oh, mes félicitations, mademoiselle.</i>

02:17:40.127 --> 02:17:41.663
- Monsieur.
- Congratulations.

02:17:41.795 --> 02:17:43.957
- And bonne chance to both of you.
- Thank you.

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:46.205
- Goodbye, Monsieur Poirot.
- Goodbye, sir.

02:17:46.341 --> 02:17:47.797
- Colonel Race.
- Good luck.

02:17:50.888 --> 02:17:54.050
Oh, mes petite! A word of advice.

02:17:54.183 --> 02:17:59.269
As they say in America, take it easy.

02:17:59.396 --> 02:18:00.852
We'll try.

02:18:09.239 --> 02:18:12.948
- What are you thinking?
- I was thinking of Moliére.

02:18:13.075 --> 02:18:17.491
<i>"La grande ambition des femmes
est d'inspiner l'amour."</i>

02:18:17.623 --> 02:18:20.615
I do wish you'd speak
some known language.

02:18:20.751 --> 02:18:25.460
"The great ambition of women
is to inspire love."

02:18:26.305 --> 02:18:32.775
