01:42.458 --> 01:44.417
<i>The past
can haunt a man.</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:48.333
<i>That's what they say.</i>

01:54.500 --> 01:57.083
<i>And the past is just a series
of moments.</i>

01:59.792 --> 02:02.333
<i>Each one... perfect.</i>

02:04.375 --> 02:05.458
<i>Complete.</i>

02:07.708 --> 02:10.292
<i>A bead on the necklace of time.</i>

02:36.208 --> 02:38.000
<i>The past doesn't haunt us.</i>

02:39.583 --> 02:41.292
<i>Wouldn't even recognize us.</i>

02:43.375 --> 02:45.542
<i>If there are ghosts
to be found...</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:49.417
<i>it's us who haunt the past.</i>

03:05.250 --> 03:06.625
You lost your queen.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.375
Care to find her again?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.417
Maybe another time.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.458
You're late.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.375
"Late" is a construct
of linear time.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.542
We don't deal in that.

03:25.417 --> 03:28.750
And yet, we charge by the hour.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.833
Your first appointment's
already in.

03:32.917 --> 03:34.167
Who is it?

03:34.250 --> 03:36.542
Your old pal from the forces.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.167
The one who never pays.

03:45.750 --> 03:46.708
Hank.

03:47.750 --> 03:48.917
Hey, Bannister.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.542
How you been?

03:52.625 --> 03:54.958
Got turfed out of the place
I was crashin' at.

03:55.042 --> 03:56.500
Land baron?

03:56.583 --> 03:57.708
You know it.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.958
They stealin' all the drylands.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.792
I've been missin' my old place.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.875
I'd like to see Angie again.

04:06.958 --> 04:08.417
'Course.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.083
<i>It used to be
you couldn't go back again.</i>

04:10.167 --> 04:13.083
<i>But time is no longer
a one-way stream.</i>

04:13.167 --> 04:17.208
<i>Memory is the boat
that sails against its current.</i>

04:17.291 --> 04:18.625
<i>And I'm the oarsman.</i>

04:22.458 --> 04:24.875
<i>When the waters rose
and war broke out...</i>

04:24.958 --> 04:27.500
<i>there wasn't a lot to look
forward to...</i>

04:27.583 --> 04:30.833
<i>so people began looking back.</i>

04:30.917 --> 04:34.417
<i>The tank started
as an interrogation tool...</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:35.792
<i>and since then...</i>

04:35.875 --> 04:38.042
<i>nostalgia's become
a way of life.</i>

04:38.125 --> 04:39.333
Mic.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.958
<i>But for Watts and me,
it's a living.</i>

04:46.625 --> 04:49.083
Synaptic map complete.
Ready for the lull.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.500
You're going on a journey.

04:56.417 --> 04:57.833
A journey through memory.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.292
Your destination?

05:00.375 --> 05:02.583
A place and time
you've been before.

05:03.833 --> 05:05.917
To reach it...

05:06.000 --> 05:08.333
all you have to do
is follow my voice.

05:10.292 --> 05:13.083
It's summer. 13 years ago.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.167
You're in the fields
behind your father's house.

05:28.292 --> 05:29.375
You pick up the ball.

05:30.875 --> 05:32.083
<i>Ah!</i>

05:36.917 --> 05:40.417
<i>Come on, Angie. Drop it.</i>

05:43.500 --> 05:46.125
Come on, drop it, Angie.
Come on.

05:46.208 --> 05:48.625
Yeah, you're a good girl.

05:48.708 --> 05:52.000
Okay. You ready? You ready?

05:52.083 --> 05:53.167
<i>Go get it.</i>

05:55.792 --> 05:58.500
<i>Come here, baby. Come here.</i>

05:58.583 --> 06:00.083
<i>Come here, drop it.</i>

06:00.167 --> 06:04.792
<i>Aww! That's a good girl. Yeah.
You're such a good girl.</i>

06:04.875 --> 06:07.083
<i>Come on, you ready?</i>

06:08.792 --> 06:10.333
You wanna go again?

06:10.417 --> 06:11.667
Go get it.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.083
<i>Go get the ball, Angie.</i>

06:14.167 --> 06:16.833
I love that damn dog.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.333
I'm cash-strapped,
but I got these.

06:19.417 --> 06:22.333
You know what baca will do
if you don't get off it, right?

06:22.417 --> 06:25.750
Well, nothin' worse than
what the world's already done.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.250
You know how it was.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.500
You two served.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.875
I heard you were
a damn good shot.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.500
Mm. Only after
a couple of drinks.

06:35.583 --> 06:38.583
And if I aimed
one man to the right.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.000
It's not quite enough, but...

06:43.083 --> 06:45.292
- I can get you back next time.
- No, it's on the house.

06:46.667 --> 06:47.750
Thank you.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.333
You keep putting shit
on the house

06:51.417 --> 06:52.708
for your war buddies...

06:52.792 --> 06:54.500
the roof's liable to cave in.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.958
We'll be fine, Watts.
Nostalgia never goes out of style.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.958
<i>Truth is, nothing is more
addictive than the past.</i>

07:04.417 --> 07:07.250
<i>Who wouldn't want to be
reunited with a loved one?</i>

07:09.583 --> 07:12.583
<i>Or relive the most meaningful
moments of their life?</i>

07:12.667 --> 07:14.667
<i>Look at those toes.</i>

07:16.292 --> 07:17.833
Can Mommy kiss the toesies?

07:19.833 --> 07:22.000
<i>Mommy's special girl.</i>

07:22.083 --> 07:26.042
<i>But memories, even good
ones, have a voracious appetite.</i>

07:28.375 --> 07:31.708
<i>If you're not careful,
they consume you.</i>

07:33.042 --> 07:35.583
Don't worry, my flower.
I love you.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.500
<i>I'll always take care of you.</i>

07:41.750 --> 07:43.625
Hey, Elsa.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.125
Here. Take it home.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.500
You always revisit
the same memory.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.208
This way, you can
watch it anytime...

07:50.292 --> 07:52.833
instead of wasting your money
on the tank every week.

07:52.917 --> 07:53.958
Thanks.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.750
But it's not the same.

07:55.833 --> 08:00.250
In the reminiscence,
I can feel his arms around me.

08:00.333 --> 08:01.625
Nothing compares.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.708
Thought you were worried
about the roof caving in.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.583
I'm tired of staring
at his pasty ass.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.375
She needs to quit being
sentimental and move the hell on.

08:39.957 --> 08:41.125
I'm headin' home.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.667
Here. Have some.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.125
It'll help with the pain.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.792
You think I can't tell
when you're hurting?

08:48.875 --> 08:51.250
Well, I have the leg.
What's your excuse?

08:51.333 --> 08:52.792
I work for you.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.167
We have another appointment?

08:56.250 --> 08:57.250
No.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.000
We're closed.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.125
I'm sorry. I know it's late.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.167
I lost my keys on the way home
from work.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.583
I've looked for hours,
but I can't find them anywhere.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.333
Call a locksmith.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.917
<i>It's bad for
business, but it's true.</i>

09:13.000 --> 09:15.500
<i>There are certain moments
that never leave you.</i>

09:17.625 --> 09:19.583
<i>Like the moment
I first saw her.</i>

09:21.958 --> 09:23.375
We can give her a quick nudge.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.583
Thank you.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.458
What is that for?

09:34.542 --> 09:36.500
Protects everyone.

09:36.583 --> 09:40.250
Ensures that we don't have you remember
anything you don't want us to know.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.083
Do you think you can
find my keys?

09:42.167 --> 09:45.292
That depends.
Are they lost or forgotten?

09:45.375 --> 09:48.750
Forgotten things can always be
fished up and dusted off.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.250
But the lost, those things people
never really took much notice of...

09:51.333 --> 09:52.708
till they were gone.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.625
They're defined
by their absence.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.583
You can't remember something
that never made an impression.

09:57.667 --> 10:01.250
Let's say the keys
are misplaced.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.667
It's your money.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.125
Just take a seat.

10:09.625 --> 10:13.042
Thiopental. Relaxes the neural
pathways for the prompts.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.125
It won't hurt.
Just a little pinch.

10:16.958 --> 10:17.875
Okay?

10:20.917 --> 10:23.208
Sedative will kick in soon.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.792
If you'd liked to get undressed,
we provide modesty suits...

10:25.875 --> 10:28.000
so I can slip out while you...

10:28.083 --> 10:29.792
You're gonna see it all anyway,
aren't you?

10:33.875 --> 10:36.792
You'll have to lose those.

10:43.833 --> 10:46.625
So, we never go over 30 volts.

10:46.708 --> 10:49.625
You don't need much to unlock
a flood of memories.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.125
Trick is finding the right one.

10:52.292 --> 10:54.542
Relax. It always
works out fine.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.000
Don't say "always."

10:56.083 --> 10:58.167
"Always" makes promises
it can't keep.

11:04.042 --> 11:05.917
I'm Mae, by the way.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.958
Nick.

11:12.292 --> 11:14.375
Let's get this over with,
shall we?

11:18.542 --> 11:22.333
You're going on a journey.
A journey through memory.

11:22.417 --> 11:23.500
Your destination?

11:23.583 --> 11:26.208
A place and time
you've been before.

11:26.292 --> 11:29.958
To reach it, all you have to do
is follow my voice.

11:30.042 --> 11:32.250
It's last night.
The sun is setting.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.833
You're beginning your day.

11:45.125 --> 11:46.958
Oh.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.750
Okay.

11:51.417 --> 11:52.542
Sunken Coast?

12:26.583 --> 12:27.917
She decent?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.208
Like she'd care.

12:44.042 --> 12:47.375
There. She put the keys
in her bag.

12:47.458 --> 12:49.833
When did you next take your
keys out of your purse?

13:02.250 --> 13:04.042
<i>She's still got 'em.</i>

13:04.125 --> 13:06.083
<i>Here you go. Bye.</i>

13:07.083 --> 13:08.042
Reset.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.542
<i>Have you seen my earrings?</i>

13:16.625 --> 13:19.417
- Which ones?
- My lucky ones. The jade?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.500
We got 'em.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.750
Reset.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.792
Why bother?
She left the keys in the dressing room.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.833
Nick, come on,
let's pull her out of the tank.

13:37.917 --> 13:38.833
In a sec.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.333
What the hell's
wrong with her?

14:12.583 --> 14:16.750

15:48.000 --> 15:49.792
Hey.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.292
Miss Fancy left something.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.417
<i>When the sun rises...</i>

16:05.500 --> 16:07.708
<i>Miami turns into a ghost town.</i>

16:12.250 --> 16:15.750
<i>To escape the heat of day,
the city's become nocturnal.</i>

16:22.167 --> 16:24.042
<i>But sleep doesn't come easy.</i>

16:29.208 --> 16:31.083
<i>We're all haunted by something.</i>

17:01.083 --> 17:03.667
<i>Years ago, the battles
at the border ended...</i>

17:03.750 --> 17:05.833
<i>but the battles at home
had just begun.</i>

17:08.291 --> 17:11.375
<i>We try to go on like
nothing's changed...</i>

17:11.458 --> 17:14.666
<i>but underneath,
the city simmers with unrest...</i>

17:14.750 --> 17:17.500
<i>which means the DA's office
is never short of work.</i>

17:22.958 --> 17:25.083
Walter Sylvan is gravely ill.

17:25.166 --> 17:28.125
Walter Sylvan is the most
notorious land baron in Miami.

17:28.208 --> 17:32.125
He wanted to buy the land cheap,
so he burned it to the ground.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.875
Sorry I'm late.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.333
It's all right.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.875
The DA won't be needing your
services after all.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.083
Isn't that right, Avery?

17:39.167 --> 17:41.083
I'll contest this
at a higher court.

17:41.167 --> 17:43.792
I'm sure they'll agree my client's
in no shape to get in the tank.

17:43.875 --> 17:48.167
If you wanna depose him, you'll
have to do it the old-fashioned way.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.167
You can't convict me for being
a good businessman, sweetheart.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.833
No, but I could convict you
for murder.

17:52.917 --> 17:54.708
There were families in that
building, Mr. Sylvan.

17:54.792 --> 17:56.125
Not all of them made it
out on time.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.667
I never burned
any buildings.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.125
No, of course not.
Your lackeys did it for you.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.750
I suppose you and your associate
will have to put me in the tank...

18:02.833 --> 18:04.500
to prove that little theory.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.667
But it appears that won't be happening.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.375
Case is going well, then.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.542
Nothing we can do.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.625
The law doesn't apply to men
like Sylvan.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.375
Come on, Dad. Let me take you
home to your medicine.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.833
I have to get my affairs
in order.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.292
Have you found her yet?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.083
No, Dad. Not yet.

18:34.292 --> 18:35.625
<i>Avery's right.</i>

18:35.708 --> 18:38.542
<i>Arson, bribery, murder.</i>

18:38.625 --> 18:40.792
<i>The whole city is rotten
with corruption.</i>

18:40.875 --> 18:43.375
<i>Both united, one voice!
Down with the Sylvans!</i>

18:43.458 --> 18:47.250
<i>During the war, barons like Walter
Sylvan bought up all the drylands...</i>

18:47.375 --> 18:49.583
<i>for pennies on the dollar.</i>

18:49.667 --> 18:51.583
<i>They profited off
the desperate</i>

18:51.667 --> 18:54.375
<i>and left them to live
at the mercy of the tides.</i>

18:55.917 --> 18:58.833
<i>The displaced carry on
the best they can.</i>

19:01.083 --> 19:03.917
<i>One day, the ocean
will reclaim all of this.</i>

19:06.042 --> 19:07.458
<i>Until then...</i>

19:07.542 --> 19:10.833
<i>the Sunken Coast is
where they call home.</i>

19:24.417 --> 19:30.125
<i>♪ I set my chin
A little higher ♪</i>

19:30.208 --> 19:35.250
<i>♪ I hope a little longer ♪</i>

19:35.333 --> 19:39.458
<i>♪ Build a little stronger ♪</i>

19:39.542 --> 19:44.000
<i>♪ Castle in the air ♪</i>

19:44.083 --> 19:47.750
<i>♪ And thinking
You'll be there ♪</i>

19:50.875 --> 19:56.958
<i>♪ I walk a little faster ♪</i>

20:15.083 --> 20:16.125
Thank you.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.375
You have a great voice.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.625
Four years I've worked here.

20:26.708 --> 20:30.000
And you're the first man
to notice my voice.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.208
Will you tell me something
I've been wondering about?

20:32.292 --> 20:35.250
Before you performed last
night, you were crying.

20:35.958 --> 20:36.792
Why?

20:38.250 --> 20:41.167
That was my memory.

20:41.250 --> 20:45.208
Shouldn't you have just seen
the things I was looking at?

20:45.292 --> 20:46.750
Close your eyes.

20:46.833 --> 20:49.542
It's a little demonstration
to answer your question.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.500
So, you have a boyfriend

20:53.583 --> 20:55.208
- or someone you're involved with?
- Oh.

20:55.292 --> 20:56.667
- What does that...
- Answer the question.

20:57.750 --> 20:58.875
Eyes closed.

21:00.708 --> 21:05.042
No, I'm not involved right now.

21:05.125 --> 21:09.375
Then for the purposes of this experiment,
we'll use something more elemental.

21:09.458 --> 21:10.583
Your first kiss.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.125
Picture that moment.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.542
Charlie Mulvaney.

21:17.625 --> 21:20.292
Okay. The way
young Charlie approached.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.458
And the kiss itself.

21:25.542 --> 21:26.875
Not just the beginning...

21:27.875 --> 21:29.292
the whole kiss.

21:31.417 --> 21:33.125
Until the moment
you break away.

21:37.042 --> 21:39.667
And by the end, you saw yourself
as well as him, didn't you?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.792
Happens with everyone.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.750
Your turn to answer
my question.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.542
Why were you crying?

21:50.208 --> 21:51.292
Nerves.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.042
Happens before every gig.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.417
I step onto that stage...

21:57.500 --> 22:00.833
and they don't wanna see a
woman in a thrift store dress...

22:00.917 --> 22:02.917
wondering how she's gonna
make rent.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.250
They want something perfect.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.542
They want to be lied to.

22:12.917 --> 22:14.667
You don't seem
like you're lying.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.583
Well, I guess it's working.

22:24.458 --> 22:25.833
Would you escort me home?

22:28.875 --> 22:29.833
All right.

23:00.833 --> 23:03.250
Don't bother. Bulb's out.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.833
Would you like some water?

23:05.917 --> 23:07.375
- Sure.
- Okay.

23:28.042 --> 23:29.708
That machine of yours...

23:33.083 --> 23:36.542
How close can you get
before the illusion's broken?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.458
Can you get this close?

23:47.125 --> 23:48.375
This close?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.708
How about...

23:57.917 --> 23:59.083
this close?

24:03.125 --> 24:05.875
Aren't you tired of watching
from the shadows?

25:19.875 --> 25:21.583
You're up early.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.792
I like it this time of day.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.625
Before the sun sets
and the city wakes up.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.458
Tea?

25:30.542 --> 25:32.167
I can't find my mug.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.708
It's under your sink,
next to a lipstick, a stocking...

25:35.792 --> 25:36.750
and...

25:37.583 --> 25:38.875
your neck massager.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.292
You were snooping.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.167
I saw it in your reminiscence.

25:46.333 --> 25:48.333
How come I don't remember
the mug?

25:48.417 --> 25:52.333
People tend to notice the same things
they were focused on in the moment.

25:52.417 --> 25:55.500
I mean, it's possible,
if you revisit the same memory enough

25:55.583 --> 25:58.000
to notice new things, but...

25:58.083 --> 26:00.292
if you're not careful,
you can get burned.

26:00.375 --> 26:03.792
Have that moment seared in
an endless loop in your mind.

26:03.875 --> 26:05.875
That's why you
never go in the tank?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.125
Memories are like perfume.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.625
Better in small doses.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.458
Maybe you haven't made
the right memories.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.708
Jesus Christ.
You're in here again?

26:38.792 --> 26:40.875
No, no, no! Put me back!
Put me back!

26:40.958 --> 26:42.750
For months now,
you've been hitting this tank,

26:42.833 --> 26:44.708
reliving every damn memory
you had with her.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.625
You have to get your head
out of the past

26:46.708 --> 26:47.917
and into the here and now.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.375
God damn it!

26:49.458 --> 26:51.250
Oh, shit.

27:01.708 --> 27:03.208
It's been months, Nick.

27:03.292 --> 27:05.250
I can't keep turning
a blind eye to this.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.875
I'm the boss, not you.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.125
And I've turned a blind eye
to plenty.

27:09.208 --> 27:12.250
Well, the difference is I know what I'm
gonna find at the bottom of a bottle.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.750
And it's not answers.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.250
We were happy.
We were planning for the future.

27:16.333 --> 27:19.583
She wouldn't just disappear,
not without a word.

27:19.667 --> 27:23.667
She settled up with her landlord.
She emptied her apartment.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.792
She would have told me.

27:25.875 --> 27:26.958
Why didn't she tell me?

27:28.917 --> 27:32.750
All I know is, wherever she is,
she has moved on. And you should, too.

27:32.833 --> 27:35.625
People don't just vanish.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.375
Okay? She must be
in some kind of trouble.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.583
We're the ones
in trouble, Nick.

27:39.667 --> 27:43.375
Pods poaching our business,
regulars jumping ship.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.250
Even Elsa hasn't popped by
for her usual in months.

27:46.333 --> 27:50.000
I never thought I'd miss the sight of
that old man's pasty ass, but here we are.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.833
Every business
has its ups and downs.

27:51.917 --> 27:53.917
No, no, no. This is different.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.125
We've gotten by
in the Spill-Zone for years.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.083
But pretty soon that dam
is gonna break,

27:58.167 --> 28:01.333
and we'll be underwater with
no funds to fish ourselves out.

28:01.417 --> 28:04.208
So, what do you
expect me to do, hmm?

28:04.292 --> 28:07.042
Avery called. She's got
a day job for us.

28:07.125 --> 28:09.292
So, go home and get some sleep.

28:09.375 --> 28:10.792
'Cause you look like shit.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.625
<i>I try to forget.</i>

28:18.708 --> 28:21.333
<i>But even without the tank,
she haunts me.</i>

28:24.250 --> 28:25.667
<i>That book.</i>

28:25.750 --> 28:28.917
<i>I see you reading it sometimes
when you can't sleep.</i>

28:29.000 --> 28:31.625
What are those?
Are those memories?

28:31.708 --> 28:34.500
They aren't mine.
They belong to the people I interrogated.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.958
During the war?

28:40.417 --> 28:42.667
You can't find one memory
without moving through others.

28:42.750 --> 28:46.125
I couldn't just see the things
I was asked to find.

28:46.208 --> 28:47.833
I saw why they ran
in the first place.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.708
When the waves came for them...

28:51.833 --> 28:53.333
they had no walls
to hide behind.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.417
And the people,
what happened to them?

28:59.500 --> 29:00.958
The world moved on.

29:02.542 --> 29:04.667
Trying to pretend like
none of this happened.

29:07.958 --> 29:10.375
But there are some things
we should never forget.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.333
And some things we can't forget
even if we want to.

29:17.917 --> 29:18.917
<i>Where did she go?</i>

29:20.667 --> 29:21.917
<i>Why did she leave?</i>

29:25.167 --> 29:27.250
<i>People don't just disappear.</i>

29:33.667 --> 29:35.292
All right.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.458
Look, man. I'll tell you the
same thing I tell you every time.

29:37.542 --> 29:38.708
Mae isn't here.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.708
If there's something you know,
please, anything.

29:45.792 --> 29:48.292
I'm not sure Mae was the person
you thought she was.

30:11.542 --> 30:13.208
<i>You're going on a journey.</i>

30:14.750 --> 30:16.708
<i>A journey through memory.</i>

30:17.750 --> 30:19.250
<i>Your destination?</i>

30:19.333 --> 30:21.708
<i>A place and time
you've been before.</i>

30:23.042 --> 30:24.292
<i>Are you awake?</i>

30:25.417 --> 30:26.458
<i>No.</i>

30:29.000 --> 30:31.042
Then I must be dreaming, too.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.250
This bruise, what happened?

30:38.375 --> 30:40.750
Oh, occupational hazard.

30:40.833 --> 30:44.208
You try waiting tables
in 6-inch heels.

30:45.250 --> 30:46.583
Oh.

30:46.667 --> 30:49.833
How did you smuggle us
into baron country anyway?

30:49.917 --> 30:51.833
Called in a favor
from an old client.

30:51.917 --> 30:54.375
You do this to impress
all the girls?

30:55.333 --> 30:56.875
Only the one I'm in love with.

30:59.875 --> 31:03.583
You don't love me. We've only
known each other a few months.

31:03.667 --> 31:06.500
You know how many sunsets
I saw in the trenches?

31:07.375 --> 31:09.500
1,458.

31:10.542 --> 31:12.333
I counted them, every minute.

31:12.417 --> 31:17.167
Sunset was the last few minutes
before the fighting began again.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.125
I used to wonder how I could
spend those moments better.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.167
Now I know.

31:42.208 --> 31:43.708
Come with me.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.500
There's somewhere
I wanna take you.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.417
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

31:59.500 --> 32:02.333
<i>A story?
What kind of story?</i>

32:03.208 --> 32:04.958
One with a happy ending.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.417
No such thing
as a happy ending.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.625
All endings are sad.

32:10.708 --> 32:13.083
Especially if the story
was happy.

32:13.167 --> 32:16.375
Then tell me a happy story,
but end it in the middle.

32:19.125 --> 32:21.667
Ever hear of Orpheus
and Eurydice?

32:28.917 --> 32:30.000
Jesus.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.833
We're closed!

32:46.000 --> 32:47.083
Shit.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.708
She came back for me.
I know she did.

33:28.792 --> 33:31.167
She could've lost that earring
months ago.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.958
All kinds of shit
gets swept up in the gutter.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.167
- You're late, Bannister.
- You're not gonna take me in again!

33:42.250 --> 33:43.458
- Relax.
- Not again!

33:43.542 --> 33:45.958
Ah, shit. Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

33:50.542 --> 33:52.292
Saw a lot of runners
at the border.

33:52.375 --> 33:54.458
There are more elegant ways of
stopping a man than a bullet.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.000
Yeah?

33:56.083 --> 33:59.000
I heard your partner didn't
share the same philosophy.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.583
Only philosophy I had
was "don't die."

34:01.667 --> 34:04.542
And I went through plenty of
bullets trying to keep it that way.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.875
- Oh, they're here.
- Okay, good.

34:12.958 --> 34:14.250
It's about time.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.542
I haven't seen a rig like this
since the war.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.167
Government cutbacks.

34:18.250 --> 34:21.333
2D's all they spring
for now for offsites.

34:22.042 --> 34:23.333
Meet Mr. Falks.

34:23.417 --> 34:25.667
Drug dealer, recently OD'd
on his own supply.

34:25.750 --> 34:29.792
Rumor is, he was working for a baca
kingpin out of New Orleans named Saint Joe.

34:29.875 --> 34:31.583
Joe is the one we're after.

34:31.667 --> 34:33.667
Could be the only thing left
in there is jambalaya, but...

34:33.750 --> 34:36.833
if you do find anything,
the warrant gives us a window of 10 years.

34:36.917 --> 34:39.167
At least it saves us
on thiopental.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.042
It's been 12 goddamn hours.
Still no sign of Joe?

34:51.125 --> 34:53.417
Well, you should have invested
in a better rig.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.917
It's not just that.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.625
His mind's fighting my prompts
because he's dying.

34:57.708 --> 34:59.542
Dying men always want closure.

34:59.625 --> 35:04.417
Some last, happy thought
to cling to before they die.

35:05.292 --> 35:06.542
I need another approach.

35:10.958 --> 35:13.042
Do you enjoy
a good party, Falks?

35:20.375 --> 35:21.833
Oh, here we go.

35:29.458 --> 35:30.750
<i>What's up?</i>

35:35.542 --> 35:36.750
Where is this?

35:37.750 --> 35:39.333
Looks like New Orleans.

35:39.417 --> 35:41.417
That's Lorenzo.
That's Joe's main muscle.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.250
<i>Lorenzo, what's happenin'?</i>

35:44.375 --> 35:45.583
All right.

35:47.833 --> 35:48.917
Is that anyone?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.208
<i>Keep 'em coming.</i>

35:51.458 --> 35:53.542
Did you see any other
old friends?

35:57.042 --> 36:00.000
Holy shit, that's him.
We got him. That's Saint Joe.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.000
'Sup, Joe?

36:11.250 --> 36:13.875
I got a big shipment
comin' in soon.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.875
Gonna need your friends on the
force to look the other way.

36:18.792 --> 36:20.458
That could be arranged.

36:20.542 --> 36:21.917
He's making
some kind of deal.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.458
Who's that
Joe's talking to?

36:23.542 --> 36:25.167
Some lowlife.
Who cares?

36:25.250 --> 36:27.500
<i>♪ Whispered something
In your ear ♪</i>

36:27.583 --> 36:29.000
She's new.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.625
Mae?

36:35.708 --> 36:38.500
- <i>♪ It was a perverted thing to say ♪</i>
- Oh, shit.

36:43.708 --> 36:48.042
<i>♪ But I said it anyway ♪</i>

36:48.125 --> 36:49.042
When? When was this?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.750
Over five years ago.

36:54.417 --> 36:58.208
<i>♪ Made you smile
And look away ♪</i>

37:04.167 --> 37:08.917
<i>♪ Nothing's gonna

37:13.667 --> 37:18.542
<i>♪ As long as you're with me,

37:23.917 --> 37:27.833
<i>♪ Nothing's gonna

37:29.875 --> 37:31.917
<i>Get me an introduction.</i>

37:32.000 --> 37:34.458
Warrant doesn't cover Joe's booty
calls. We need to move on from this.

37:34.542 --> 37:36.375
The girl, when did you
next see her?

37:41.958 --> 37:44.833
Hey, Joe. This is Mae.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.000
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.875
The pleasure, <i>shi wo de.</i>

37:54.833 --> 37:56.000
Hmm.

37:59.042 --> 38:01.917
No, no, no,
not that pastel shit. Hmm.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.792
Ever tried baca?

38:07.208 --> 38:09.333
They're a little strong
for my taste.

38:09.417 --> 38:13.583
Listen, you're gonna sing
at his club, party in his pad...

38:13.667 --> 38:15.417
but you're too good
for his baca?

38:15.500 --> 38:17.042
Easy, Falks.

38:17.125 --> 38:20.542
A girl like you needs
to be put in her place.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.750
Let go! No, no. No!

38:27.333 --> 38:29.125
<i>What the hell, Joe?</i>

38:29.208 --> 38:31.125
<i>Apologize to the lady.</i>

38:31.208 --> 38:32.583
Apologize to her?

38:32.667 --> 38:35.417
You misapprehend your place
in the world, Falks.

38:35.500 --> 38:39.250
See, a <i>niu</i> like that
is one of a kind.

38:39.333 --> 38:43.417
Whereas men like you
are replaceable.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.958
Wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

38:46.042 --> 38:48.500
I recommend doing it outside.

38:48.583 --> 38:50.083
Easier to hose down
the brain matter.

38:50.167 --> 38:51.250
No. Please.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.417
<i>Please! You can't do this.</i>

38:53.500 --> 38:57.042
Sure, I can. Probably get
a medal for it.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.750
<i>Stop, stop, stop!
Don't shoot.</i>

38:58.833 --> 39:00.167
<i>See how simple it would be?</i>

39:00.250 --> 39:02.042
All NOLA cops
are dirty. Focus on Joe.

39:02.125 --> 39:04.500
- Just wait.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

39:08.875 --> 39:11.667
<i>You all right?
You look shaken.</i>

39:11.750 --> 39:13.708
- <i>It's okay?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

39:13.792 --> 39:15.875
<i>You sure you don't want one?</i>

39:15.958 --> 39:17.667
<i>It's good for the nerves.</i>

39:17.750 --> 39:19.042
Jesus, don't.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.250
What are you doing, Mae?

39:21.333 --> 39:22.833
Who gives a shit
about this girl?

39:22.917 --> 39:24.542
- Get back to the collusion case, Nick.
- Hang on.

39:24.625 --> 39:26.125
- Tell us about Saint Joe.
- Hey. Hey.

39:26.208 --> 39:28.000
- Look, he sent you here...
- Don't do that.

39:28.083 --> 39:29.792
...because he's expanding his baca
business into Miami, isn't he?

39:33.667 --> 39:36.042
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... What the hell is that?
- He's blanking.

39:36.125 --> 39:37.958
You really should let the
professionals do the prompting.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.125
- I just asked a question.
- A leading question.

39:40.208 --> 39:43.000
You presupposed Joe sent Falks here
to help with a Miami expansion.

39:43.083 --> 39:45.583
You were wrong. There's no
memory to access, you hit static.

39:45.667 --> 39:48.542
He blanks for more than a couple of
minutes and he'll get brain damage.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.917
Bannister. God damn it,
just do it.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.583
All right.
Come here, quick.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.000
It's all right, Falks.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.125
You took a misstep.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.083
You just traveled
down the wrong path.

40:04.167 --> 40:05.708
But now you're back...

40:05.792 --> 40:08.875
back to somewhere you've been,
with someone you know.

40:15.125 --> 40:17.875
The girl you sent to Joe,
when was the last time you saw her?

40:22.292 --> 40:24.542
<i>Hey.
Sorry to bother you.</i>

40:24.625 --> 40:26.917
<i>I'm just here to pick up
the weekly drop.</i>

40:29.125 --> 40:31.875
<i>Had to go anyway,
baby. Be good, huh?</i>

40:31.958 --> 40:33.125
Mm-hmm.

40:35.458 --> 40:36.875
Joe's leaving. Move on, Nick.

40:36.958 --> 40:38.875
<i>Have a seat, Falks.</i>

40:38.958 --> 40:40.500
<i>I really shouldn't.</i>

40:40.583 --> 40:42.542
<i>Joe won't mind.</i>

40:42.625 --> 40:44.708
Do you remember
the first time we met?

40:46.208 --> 40:48.375
<i>I was broke. Alone.</i>

40:48.458 --> 40:50.500
<i>I thought I had nothing
left to lose.</i>

40:50.583 --> 40:52.875
<i>But I was wrong. I still had...</i>

40:52.958 --> 40:57.083
a shred of innocence,
a glimmer of hope.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.125
And then I...

41:02.208 --> 41:06.250
<i>I tried baca. And it took
everything away.</i>

41:06.333 --> 41:08.375
The innocence, the hope.

41:08.458 --> 41:12.083
<i>But also the fear, the hurt...</i>

41:13.792 --> 41:15.583
<i>the guilt.</i>

41:15.667 --> 41:18.292
<i>I became invincible...</i>

41:18.375 --> 41:21.667
<i>because nothing mattered.</i>

41:23.292 --> 41:27.375
<i>Nothing but these</i>
<i>little pearls.</i>

41:27.458 --> 41:28.750
<i>I should go.</i>

41:28.833 --> 41:30.833
Joe's expecting his baca drop.

41:32.083 --> 41:33.542
What the hell?

41:36.375 --> 41:37.833
You stealing from Joe?

41:39.167 --> 41:40.417
Why?

41:40.500 --> 41:43.833
Because I have nothing
left to lose.

41:43.917 --> 41:45.417
Get your head
in the game, Nick.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.917
You're growing gills
in the tank for that junkie?

41:47.000 --> 41:50.292
She's not a junkie. She's not.

41:50.375 --> 41:53.292
Oh, shit. You didn't even know.

41:53.375 --> 41:57.208
- She never touched baca. Ever. Right?
- God damn it.

42:00.875 --> 42:02.625
You knew and you never said?

42:04.750 --> 42:06.792
Wasn't my place.

42:06.875 --> 42:10.125
Baca is a drug that
you don't kick. Ever.

42:10.208 --> 42:12.167
She'll keep going back to it
and to whoever she gets it from.

42:12.250 --> 42:13.667
Then I know where to find her.

42:17.792 --> 42:18.833
Nick!

42:33.458 --> 42:34.500
<i>Who was she?</i>

42:36.792 --> 42:38.583
<i>Who was she when not with me?</i>

42:43.958 --> 42:45.750
<i>Was she the woman I knew?</i>

42:46.917 --> 42:49.000
<i>Or that stranger I saw?</i>

42:54.667 --> 42:56.792
<i>Was she running
from the past...</i>

42:58.125 --> 43:01.333
<i>or racing back towards it?</i>

43:01.417 --> 43:04.375
<i>To find where she'd gone,
I had to know where she'd been.</i>

43:05.750 --> 43:07.292
<i>I had to look back...</i>

43:08.417 --> 43:09.542
<i>to New Orleans.</i>

43:28.208 --> 43:29.875
The hell do you want?

43:29.958 --> 43:33.417
I'm looking for Saint Joe.
Lorenzo referred me.

43:35.417 --> 43:36.875
Friend of Lorenzo's.

43:43.917 --> 43:46.625
He said he's a friend
of Lorenzo's.

43:58.250 --> 44:00.167
Friends with Lorenzo, eh?

44:01.500 --> 44:03.208
You got <i>guanxi</i> with me, pal?

44:04.292 --> 44:05.583
Business transaction.

44:05.667 --> 44:07.583
I'd rather discuss it
in private.

44:07.667 --> 44:09.708
Vet, huh?

44:09.792 --> 44:12.208
You folks even starch
your sentences.

44:13.750 --> 44:16.292
What brand of henchman
were you?

44:16.375 --> 44:19.750
I was in the navy. Then I was
drafted for border patrol.

44:19.833 --> 44:24.333
Drafted. Huh.
I know how that goes.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.708
Government forced your hand.

44:27.792 --> 44:29.583
Forced mine, too,

44:29.667 --> 44:33.708
only God-fearing citizens like me
weren't drafted for border patrol.

44:33.792 --> 44:35.625
We were rounded up
and put in little camps.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.542
You were interned.

44:37.625 --> 44:40.542
Right here in Louisiana.
9th Ward.

44:41.792 --> 44:43.750
Were you there
when the levees broke?

44:43.833 --> 44:45.583
How do you think
I got this name?

44:45.667 --> 44:49.125
Sure as hell ain't
my sense of piety.

44:49.208 --> 44:50.750
<i>"Jiu"</i> means "ninth."

44:50.833 --> 44:54.125
"Saint" 'cause they figure
my ass walks on water.

44:55.708 --> 44:58.625
But that's all blood
under the bridge now, <i>pengyou.</i>

44:58.708 --> 45:00.958
And this is business, right?

45:01.042 --> 45:04.625
Right. I need vermillion baca,
10 pallets.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.458
Bulk, eh?

45:07.542 --> 45:10.625
You got balls. Bocce-sized.

45:10.708 --> 45:13.583
Fine. Let's discuss payment.

45:13.667 --> 45:18.542
Alas, payment is not the <i>wenti</i>
holding up this transaction, <i>pengyou.</i>

45:19.250 --> 45:20.625
It's trust.

45:22.375 --> 45:25.833
For instance,
your pal Lorenzo's been dead for years.

45:25.917 --> 45:27.833
Work-related injury.

45:27.917 --> 45:32.958
Which means you're not
who you say you are. Are you?

45:43.333 --> 45:44.542
Right.

45:46.042 --> 45:49.875
People say it's peaceful
to drown...

45:49.958 --> 45:52.042
but that's <i>gou pi.</i>

45:52.125 --> 45:56.250
I learned that in the camps when your kind
left us to die after the levees burst.

45:57.958 --> 45:59.042
Here, I'll show you.

46:09.458 --> 46:14.250
Now, <i>gao su wo,</i>
why are you really here?

46:14.333 --> 46:15.708
I'm looking for a woman.

46:17.083 --> 46:20.375
Some <i>niu</i> ran out on you?

46:20.458 --> 46:23.208
I guess your balls
ain't so bocce-sized after all.

46:23.292 --> 46:24.750
She stole your baca.

46:24.833 --> 46:26.000
Goes by the name Mae.

46:27.667 --> 46:28.708
Hmm.

46:29.833 --> 46:31.792
You've seen
my favorite chanteuse.

46:34.500 --> 46:38.583
So, you come to my <i>jia</i>
thinking she boomeranged back?

46:39.833 --> 46:41.375
Sorry, <i>pengyou.</i>

46:41.458 --> 46:44.750
I haven't seen Mae since
she skipped out years ago.

46:44.833 --> 46:49.917
Don't feel bad. She fooled me
just like she fooled you.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.125
Hey, I know exactly
what she took from me.

46:54.208 --> 46:56.542
Drugs, money, time.

46:56.625 --> 46:58.833
But what did she take from you?

46:58.917 --> 47:01.750
Hmm?

47:03.625 --> 47:06.708
Oh, poor <i>guisunzi.</i>

47:06.792 --> 47:10.042
You've been had,
and you don't even know why.

47:12.917 --> 47:16.250
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry, <i>pengyou.</i>

47:16.333 --> 47:19.375
The pain will be over soon.

47:19.458 --> 47:20.917
But not too soon.

47:52.792 --> 47:54.042
Watts?

48:03.708 --> 48:05.417
Let go and I'll
shoot you myself.

48:51.500 --> 48:52.875
My tank.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.958
Shit, I'm out.

50:07.792 --> 50:09.833
Good thinking,
shooting the tank.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.375
I was aiming for Joe.

50:25.750 --> 50:27.792
I've seen this kind
of hit before.

50:27.875 --> 50:31.958
Your lungs will fill with blood.
You'll suffocate before you bleed out.

50:34.875 --> 50:36.750
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

50:37.542 --> 50:40.500
Don't let me die...

50:41.542 --> 50:43.167
like they did in the camps.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.208
We'll part as friends, then.

51:07.583 --> 51:09.917
Why do you put yourself
through this, Nick?

51:14.500 --> 51:17.792
<i>Mae.
What was she hiding?</i>

51:21.583 --> 51:23.333
You still have me in there?

51:23.417 --> 51:25.958
Locked away with all those
other memories?

51:26.042 --> 51:27.708
You and your lost keys.

51:27.792 --> 51:31.042
Ever think the best thing
would be to destroy them?

51:33.667 --> 51:34.792
Why would I do that?

51:34.875 --> 51:37.167
Maybe memory fades
for a reason.

51:37.250 --> 51:41.458
If we just dwelled on the bad things
in the past, we'd never get over them.

51:41.542 --> 51:44.750
And if we just dwelled
on the good...

51:44.833 --> 51:46.458
we might never match it again.

51:46.542 --> 51:48.833
There aren't any memories
you wanna hold on to?

51:48.917 --> 51:52.000
- I guess there's one.
- Hmm?

51:52.083 --> 51:54.542
When London sank,
I fled to New Orleans.

51:54.625 --> 51:57.417
But New Orleans had a lot of...

51:58.958 --> 52:00.833
bad associations.

52:00.917 --> 52:04.875
So, I got a one-way ticket
out of there to here.

52:04.958 --> 52:08.000
When I arrived in Miami,
I had no plan whatsoever.

52:08.083 --> 52:11.083
I had no savings,
I had no place to stay.

52:11.167 --> 52:14.375
So, I found a dinghy in a canal
and crawled in it for a nap.

52:14.458 --> 52:18.667
And while I was sleeping,
some asshole cuts me loose.

52:18.750 --> 52:22.917
<i>I drifted south past the Keys
and would have drifted forever...</i>

52:23.000 --> 52:25.583
if I hadn't found Frances.

52:25.667 --> 52:26.958
Frances?

52:27.042 --> 52:28.750
<i>At first, I thought
it was a mirage.</i>

52:28.833 --> 52:30.500
She was smoking a cigarette
on the stoop

52:30.583 --> 52:32.000
of a white clapboard house...

52:32.083 --> 52:33.958
<i>in the middle of the waves.</i>

52:34.042 --> 52:37.333
<i>It was like something
out of a dream.</i>

52:37.417 --> 52:41.833
And she took me in
and got me on my feet again.

52:43.833 --> 52:48.750
So, when I'm feeling scared
or lost...

52:48.833 --> 52:50.792
then that is
what I think about.

52:55.542 --> 52:57.292
I think of a song.

52:57.375 --> 52:59.833
- My grandfather used to hum it.
- Oh.

52:59.917 --> 53:03.375
After he died, didn't hear
that song for a long time.

53:05.042 --> 53:06.917
And then I heard it again.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.542
You sang it so sweetly,
it was like I'd never...

53:12.458 --> 53:14.292
never truly heard it before.

53:19.375 --> 53:23.750
<i>♪ You are smiling
You were smiling then ♪</i>

53:25.583 --> 53:28.583
<i>♪ Can't remember where ♪</i>

53:29.542 --> 53:31.500
<i>♪ Or when ♪</i>

53:40.917 --> 53:42.792
What are you even
looking for in there?

53:42.875 --> 53:44.333
What she took from me.

53:44.417 --> 53:46.542
She was a grifter, playing me,
looking for something.

53:46.625 --> 53:50.833
No offense, Nick,
but what would she want to take from you?

53:50.917 --> 53:53.042
The only thing of value I have
doesn't belong to me.

53:53.125 --> 53:57.250
Right. Some bullshit memories.
You're reaching.

53:57.333 --> 53:59.917
Come on, think. You were here with
her the last time she was here.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.042
Of course I was.

54:01.125 --> 54:02.625
Were you with her
the whole time?

54:09.542 --> 54:11.542
Oh. Nick's not around
for another hour.

54:11.625 --> 54:15.583
No, I brought these for him,
but this is for you.

54:16.792 --> 54:18.583
I was hoping
we could talk a bit.

54:31.458 --> 54:33.125
You don't like me, do you?

54:34.375 --> 54:36.042
Why?

54:36.125 --> 54:38.250
Nick's good at seeing people
in the tank.

54:39.583 --> 54:41.708
My eyes are clearer out here.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.667
You're hiding something.

54:56.792 --> 54:58.000
I'm an addict.

55:01.458 --> 55:02.500
I was.

55:03.708 --> 55:05.750
In New Orleans,
I got hooked on baca.

55:08.333 --> 55:10.000
And you haven't told Nick.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.708
He wouldn't judge you.

55:13.792 --> 55:15.958
He wouldn't look at me
the same way, either.

55:17.042 --> 55:18.625
Why are you telling me?

55:21.125 --> 55:22.917
Because you will judge me.

55:24.167 --> 55:26.583
But it won't change
the way you see me.

55:27.667 --> 55:29.292
I'm not one to judge.

55:32.583 --> 55:34.292
You know how I got my name?

55:34.375 --> 55:37.833
"Watts"? Figured it was
from the...

55:37.917 --> 55:39.292
During the war...

55:39.375 --> 55:43.292
after my stint on the front,
I worked in munitions.

55:43.375 --> 55:47.667
Soldering lithium batteries
into drones. It was a shit job.

55:47.750 --> 55:49.583
But I needed money
for me and my daughter.

55:50.417 --> 55:51.542
You have a child?

55:52.417 --> 55:54.542
She's grown now.

55:54.625 --> 55:57.917
We're not in touch.
I'm not exactly the maternal type.

55:59.208 --> 56:00.958
Though...

56:01.042 --> 56:02.458
I tried for a while.

56:03.250 --> 56:05.625
Even gave up drinking.

56:05.708 --> 56:09.708
The problem with going dry
is the mind is clear.

56:09.792 --> 56:11.542
But the hands...

56:13.167 --> 56:14.958
they shake.

56:15.042 --> 56:17.292
All it took
was one wrong spark.

56:17.375 --> 56:20.208
Lit up that whole place
like Independence Day.

56:22.083 --> 56:23.833
Afterward, my daughter
went north...

56:23.917 --> 56:25.333
- to stay with some relations...
- Sorry.

56:25.417 --> 56:26.958
...and I went back
to the bottle.

56:28.292 --> 56:33.125
Only thing stopped me
drowning in it was Nick.

56:33.208 --> 56:35.542
That's why you stayed
all these years.

56:35.625 --> 56:37.208
Loyalty.

56:37.292 --> 56:40.875
That, and he doesn't pay me
enough to drink myself to death.

56:42.583 --> 56:45.542
Men are strange, aren't they?

56:45.625 --> 56:48.125
They don't see
what's right in front of them.

56:48.208 --> 56:49.708
There's nothing to see.

56:51.750 --> 56:53.417
We both know that's not true.

56:57.917 --> 57:00.333
Excuse me for a sec.

57:00.417 --> 57:02.375
It's okay.
I was gonna go anyway.

57:17.750 --> 57:19.292
Whatever you saw in there...

57:21.083 --> 57:22.708
please don't
jump to conclusions, Nick.

57:22.792 --> 57:24.500
What am I supposed to think?

57:24.583 --> 57:26.542
I mean, this whole time,
you've been keeping this from me?

57:30.042 --> 57:31.208
It's complicated.

57:33.458 --> 57:35.708
I didn't wanna ruin things
between us.

57:35.792 --> 57:37.542
You were supposed to
watch over this place.

57:37.625 --> 57:41.417
Instead, you got drunk,
you let her walk into the vault.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.500
- What are you talking about?
- Look.

57:50.500 --> 57:52.708
No, no, it's impossible.

57:52.792 --> 57:54.583
Even with the keys...

57:54.667 --> 57:56.542
she wouldn't have known
the code to the vault.

57:56.625 --> 57:58.583
- Even I don't know the code to the vault.
- It's not a code...

57:58.667 --> 58:00.167
it's a tune.

58:00.250 --> 58:01.792
She studied me for months.
She must have figured it out.

58:20.417 --> 58:21.625
Everything in my batch
is here.

58:21.708 --> 58:23.208
Wait a minute, look.

58:23.292 --> 58:25.292
Look at this.
Cameron, Campbell, Caplan, Cummings.

58:25.375 --> 58:26.958
- What is it?
- There's no Carine.

58:27.042 --> 58:28.417
Elsa Carine's files.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.292
<i>They're all gone.</i>

58:30.375 --> 58:33.708
What would Mae want with Elsa?
She barely had enough to pay us.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.125
To the floating market
at the park.

58:54.208 --> 58:57.125
Sir, I'm looking
for this woman.

58:57.208 --> 59:00.500
- Sir, have you seen this woman? Elsa?
- No.

59:00.583 --> 59:02.958
- Sir, have you seen this woman?
- No.

59:03.042 --> 59:05.708
Hey, uh, I'm looking for Elsa
Carine, I think she works here.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.792
Just wanna have a word.

59:07.875 --> 59:10.292
Yeah. Talk to that rat
over there.

59:11.708 --> 59:13.208
Thank you. Hey.

59:13.833 --> 59:15.083
Hey, hey!

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Hey!

59:28.750 --> 59:29.917
Just wanna talk to you.

59:40.542 --> 59:41.625
Just wanna talk.

59:46.250 --> 59:47.500
- Hey!
- I've got papers, pig!

59:47.583 --> 59:49.375
Hey, I'm not a cop, okay?

59:49.458 --> 59:51.250
I'm a friend of Elsa's and I want to help.
I think she's in trouble.

59:51.333 --> 59:53.500
How the hell are you supposed
to help her now?

59:53.583 --> 59:54.833
She's dead.

59:57.042 --> 59:58.250
Dead?

59:59.458 --> 01:00:00.792
What happened?

01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:02.292
Told the cops.

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:04.000
But they don't care
what happens to people like us.

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:05.458
What did you see?

01:00:05.542 --> 01:00:07.042
Elsa was packing up
for the day...

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:09.542
<i>when some guy decides to get
in her face.</i>

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:12.083
<i>All I know is
Elsa didn't stand a chance.</i>

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:14.708
He killed her.

01:00:14.792 --> 01:00:16.833
I haven't seen
Freddie since.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:18.208
Freddie?

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:20.500
Elsa's kid?

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.958
<i>Elsa had a child.</i>

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:25.917
Did the man hurt Freddie, too?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.792
He left that to his girlfriend.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.792
Some redheaded bitch.
She grabbed him.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.292
Wouldn't let him go
no matter how much he screamed.

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:40.667
<i>Who was she?</i>

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.250
<i>Who was she when not with me?</i>

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:46.708
<i>A liar.</i>

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.500
<i>An addict.</i>

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:51.792
<i>A killer.</i>

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.083
<i>I had to find her.</i>

01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:59.125
<i>But it turns out,
she was already looking for me.</i>

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:11.917
Mae?

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:31.583
Forget about Mae.

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:33.167
She's moved on.

01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:37.167
And I suggest you do the same.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.583
It's me.

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:44.083
Loverboy won't be
bothering us no more.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.833
- Again.
- No.

01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:55.167
You wanna get burned?

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.875
Have this beatdown
in your brain forever?

01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.958
- You're gonna have to let this go.
- No.

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:03.375
He must have left some clue of who he is.
I just need to remember.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:04.833
- Nick!
- What are you doing?

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:06.917
I am saving your junkie ass.

01:02:08.917 --> 01:02:10.667
Okay.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:12.958
I was hoping you'd drop this,
but I can't let you burn yourself.

01:02:13.042 --> 01:02:15.708
I found something
in your peripheral vision.

01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:18.208
Anything about this face
strike you as familiar?

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:27.625
- He's the dirty cop who worked for Saint Joe.
- Yeah.

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:33.042
Let's go see what we can
find out from Avery.

01:02:35.917 --> 01:02:37.542
Break up the barons!

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:39.583
Murderers!

01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:41.083
Town's ready to riot.

01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:42.250
What happened?

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:43.875
Man, you're
in the tank so much,

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:45.500
you don't even know?

01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:47.375
The land baron,
Walter Sylvan...

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:51.042
the guy you were supposed to depose,
he died a couple of days ago.

01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:53.875
These folks were hoping the
courts would bust his monopoly.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:58.750
But his widow and son
will inherit everything.

01:02:58.833 --> 01:03:01.417
It's late.
Someone might see us.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.458
Come on, Mom.
You're just confused.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.042
Do they think
this is a mistake?

01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:11.708
Old fling of yours, Nick?

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:15.750
Yeah, we met a long time ago,
back when I first opened shop.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.667
She came to me for a session.

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:26.375
<i>Seeing Tamara
stirred a memory.</i>

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.875
<i>A clue that had been
in my mind all along.</i>

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:35.708
I thought I told you
not to get back in the tank.

01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:39.250
Well, Mae stole all of Elsa's
files, but there was another copy.

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:40.542
What did you find?

01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:43.083
Well, I talked to Avery.

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:46.333
She's still pretty pissed about
you blowing her deposition.

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:48.125
But she did give me some intel.

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:50.375
His name is Cyrus Boothe.

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:52.000
Cyrus Boothe.

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:55.292
He used to work for Saint Joe,
but they had a falling out.

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:56.958
So, he moved to Miami.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.625
And until recently,
he's been working for...

01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:02.125
- Walter Sylvan.
- Yeah.

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:04.625
See, look at this. Listen.

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:08.333
<i>Don't worry, my flower.
I love you.</i>

01:04:09.792 --> 01:04:11.792
<i>I'll always take care of you.</i>

01:04:11.875 --> 01:04:13.500
I mean, that voice
always bothered me.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:14.958
I just couldn't put my finger
on it.

01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:17.125
And then I remembered
where I'd heard it.

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:19.458
Tamara Sylvan's reminiscence.

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:20.708
Walter's widow.

01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:22.292
It was years ago.

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:24.083
I never forgot that voice.

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:27.000
- <i>Did anyone see you?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:30.417
<i>Thank God.
Everyone's mad enough as it is.</i>

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.042
<i>They think this is a mistake.</i>

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:33.458
Listen.

01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:36.875
<i>Don't worry, my flower.
I love you.</i>

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:38.833
<i>I'll always take care of you.</i>

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:46.625
They say you can't tell yet,
but I know it's a boy.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.958
Are you happy?
Tell me you're happy.

01:04:53.042 --> 01:04:55.625
I'm so happy I could dance.

01:04:56.833 --> 01:04:58.625
There's no music.

01:04:58.708 --> 01:05:01.042
Remember the song that
was playing the first night we met?

01:05:01.125 --> 01:05:03.667
On the count of three,
I want you to imagine it.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.083
<i>Can you hear it?</i>

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.583
<i>I hear it, Walter.</i>

01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:08.292
Elsa's lover
was Walter Sylvan...

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:09.333
<i>I hear it.</i>

01:05:09.417 --> 01:05:10.500
...and they had a son.

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:12.375
And Walter wanted him dead.

01:05:12.458 --> 01:05:16.000
He knew he was dying. He sent Boothe
to tie up the loose ends with Mae.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:18.917
We can't prove it.
Not with this.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.625
The only files on Elsa are in your memory.
That's hearsay.

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:25.042
Avery can't use it, but I can.

01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:27.458
If I find Boothe,
I'll find Mae.

01:05:27.542 --> 01:05:28.583
Nick, wait.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:34.625
In all the time that you knew Mae,
how much did you really know her?

01:05:34.708 --> 01:05:36.542
How much did you
really love her?

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:39.125
- Why the hell do you care?
- Because I know how blind you can be.

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:42.792
You're hurt because
you thought you were in love.

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:44.208
But it wasn't real.

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:46.167
She was an idea
wrapped in a tight dress.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.167
An absence you wanted to pour
all your broken pieces into.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:51.750
You think I'm chasing an absence?
Well, at least I'm chasing something.

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.958
I'm not just running away
all the time.

01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:55.292
What's that supposed to mean?

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:58.000
You ran away
from your own daughter.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:00.208
You can be a real son of a
bitch, you know that?

01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:01.958
But it's true, isn't it?

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:05.375
Everything you cared about,
your ex, your kid, your job...

01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:06.958
you left.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.083
I never left you.

01:06:09.167 --> 01:06:11.125
Well, maybe you should have.

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:13.125
'Cause I'm no better than the bottle
for you. I'm just another place to hide.

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:14.750
You'd be better off
working a pod.

01:06:14.833 --> 01:06:15.958
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:17.250
- No.
- Watts.

01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:20.333
What you have with me
isn't a life.

01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:22.750
It's barely a living.

01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:24.583
Maybe it's best
if you moved on.

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:26.667
You're firing me?

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:28.208
I'll call one of the pods
on your behalf.

01:06:28.292 --> 01:06:29.750
I'll set you up
with a good gig.

01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:32.917
Screw you and your charity.
This isn't about me.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.583
This is about you
and your goddamn obsession.

01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:38.250
She is responsible for the
murder of an innocent woman

01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:39.708
and the kidnapping
of a little boy.

01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:41.500
And she used my files
to do it.

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:43.125
Then go to the police.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.917
We both know the police don't
care about cases like this.

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:48.375
I'm asking you.

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:50.875
I am begging you.

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:52.583
Don't go down this path.

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:56.167
Stay here in this life.

01:06:58.333 --> 01:06:59.833
Stay here with me.

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.292
I'm sorry, Watts.

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:07.958
I have to do this.

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:15.875
Fine.

01:07:15.958 --> 01:07:18.000
You made your choice.

01:07:18.083 --> 01:07:20.042
I just hope to hell
that you survive it.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.292
'Cause I won't be around
to save your ass the next time.

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:45.417
<i>For your safety,
please stand behind the yellow line.</i>

01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:56.583
<i>The Sylvans, like all other
barons, live in the drylands.</i>

01:07:57.958 --> 01:08:00.292
<i>They build dams
to insulate themselves...</i>

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:04.333
<i>pushing the waves
into the surrounding areas.</i>

01:08:04.417 --> 01:08:10.125
<i>The barons stay afloat
by drowning everyone else.</i>

01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:14.583
<i>They say the only ones to survive the
Titanic were the rich and the rats.</i>

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.292
<i>The barons are both.</i>

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:24.125
I'd like a word with
Ms. Sylvan regarding the...

01:08:24.207 --> 01:08:26.542
I know exactly
what it's regarding.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:28.000
And you're an hour late.

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:30.625
Little tall, aren't you?

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:09.292
Try to stick to the script,
and fix the tie.

01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:38.957
Did anyone see you?

01:09:39.792 --> 01:09:41.625
Oh, thank God.

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:44.167
Everyone's mad enough as it is.

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.292
They think this is a mistake.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.207
<i>Most burners are torn apart
by the worlds they straddle...</i>

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:55.542
<i>the real one around them</i>

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.750
<i>and the one
playing in their mind.</i>

01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:02.292
<i>Only the rich mold the world
to meet their delusions.</i>

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:05.000
Do you remember me?

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.125
We met once.
I'm Nick Bannister.

01:10:09.333 --> 01:10:11.000
Walter, please.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.708
They say
you can't tell yet...

01:10:17.625 --> 01:10:19.792
but I know it's a boy.

01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.042
Your boy's grown now.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:27.667
We need to talk
about Cyrus Boothe.

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:29.500
Boothe works security
for you, right?

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.333
Where is he? Tell me.

01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:34.875
I hear it, Walter.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:37.958
I hear it.

01:10:38.042 --> 01:10:39.792
All right, I'm done playing.
Your husband is dead. Come here.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:41.208
Nonsense.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:43.542
Walter and I are expecting
our baby any day now.

01:10:50.833 --> 01:10:52.042
When are we?

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.208
It's been years, Tamara.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:57.083
When did I change?

01:10:57.167 --> 01:10:59.625
You ever hear of a girl
named Elsa Carine?

01:10:59.708 --> 01:11:02.375
She and Walter
were having an affair.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.875
One of many flowers.

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:07.208
Only this one was different.
She had a child.

01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:09.250
Walter never liked sharing.

01:11:10.167 --> 01:11:12.000
That's why he told Boothe.

01:11:12.083 --> 01:11:13.375
Told him what?

01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:16.292
To kill them. Both of them.

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:17.708
You heard him say that?

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:20.917
He's not the man
I thought he'd be.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.292
When you're young,
you think the future will be one thing.

01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:30.042
You see it play out
like a string of dominoes.

01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:32.708
You have no idea...

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:34.542
the things that are lined up.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.083
Boothe...

01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:38.708
was he working with anyone?

01:11:39.667 --> 01:11:41.000
There was a woman.

01:11:42.125 --> 01:11:44.333
Some whore from New Orleans.

01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:47.375
Where are they now?

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
Tamara, where are
Boothe and Mae?

01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:54.292
Where do you think?

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:56.458
With all the other trash
you can't throw away.

01:11:59.042 --> 01:12:00.417
You're the man
from the deposition.

01:12:01.167 --> 01:12:02.292
Security!

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.375
I just have
a couple of questions.

01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:04.458
He's harassing my mother!

01:12:04.542 --> 01:12:05.667
I'm not. I'm not harassing her.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:06.667
- It's all right. Hey.
- Come on.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.125
I know you.

01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:11.083
You're the man who remembers
everyone else's memories.

01:12:11.167 --> 01:12:13.208
What do you want us
to do with him, ma'am?

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.875
Exactly what Walter
would have done with him.

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:26.375
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait!

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:27.458
You're so happy.

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:28.417
Tamara!

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.833
You're so happy...

01:12:33.875 --> 01:12:34.958
Hey!

01:12:35.042 --> 01:12:37.083
Sorry, buddy.
I'll make it fast.

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:44.958
You served?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Two tours on the Gulf.

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:50.583
Three tours. Western line.

01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:53.250
Next time, I won't miss.

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:14.125
I wanna buy your boat.

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:29.792
<i>I didn't get much from the
Sylvan widow, but it was enough.</i>

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:32.500
<i>There's only one place
where the trash piles up...</i>

01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:35.208
<i>alongside all the city's
lost souls.</i>

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:39.417
<i>The old recycling plants.</i>

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.583
<i>To find Boothe and Mae,
I had to go to Hell itself.</i>

01:14:41.292 --> 01:14:43.417
Say it.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:48.750
Say "People like us don't fall in love.
We plummet."

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:50.167
Then touch me here.

01:14:58.083 --> 01:14:59.500
Don't move.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:03.750
Hello, Mae.

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.292
Get out of here.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:13.583
Go.

01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:26.583
Tenacious fella, ain't you?

01:15:28.375 --> 01:15:29.917
Tell me where I can find her.

01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:47.792
I bet you thought
that was fate, huh?

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.333
- What?
- Some kind of sign...

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:52.667
that she should sing that song
from when you was a kid.

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.625
But nothing's an accident
with Mae.

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:57.833
Everything's researched...

01:15:57.917 --> 01:16:00.250
meticulously calculated.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.417
You can hate her for it.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.333
But who are you to judge?

01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:09.042
Mae and me,
we're from a different world.

01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:10.625
The one that sank.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.667
When the waves came,
they washed away our lies.

01:16:18.167 --> 01:16:21.500
Revealed what this world
has always been.

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:24.250
A wilderness with one rule.

01:16:26.417 --> 01:16:29.000
Survive or die.

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:33.917
A place like that
is beyond good and evil.

01:16:35.125 --> 01:16:38.333
Only sin left
is self-deception.

01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:41.458
Telling yourself that you're
better than everyone else.

01:16:41.542 --> 01:16:44.542
That you deserve
to be standing...

01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:47.125
while everyone else sinks.

01:16:48.708 --> 01:16:51.375
I've never labored
under that delusion.

01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:53.500
Always seen myself...

01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:55.875
exactly for what I am.

01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.167
And I see you, too.

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:01.875
Where is she?

01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:05.208
You think
you're some avenging hero.

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:07.833
Where is she?

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:12.333
You're just an empty man
looking for a woman to blame.

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:15.958
Come on, shoot me.

01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:17.625
You won't get
what's in my head.

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.583
You'll never get to Mae.

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:10.417
Shit.

01:22:09.208 --> 01:22:10.708
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:17.292
<i>A story?
What kind of story?</i>

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:23.292
<i>One with a happy ending.</i>

01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:29.083
<i>No such thing
as a happy ending.</i>

01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:32.833
<i>All endings are sad.
Especially if the story was happy.</i>

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:37.208
<i>Then tell me a happy story...</i>

01:22:37.292 --> 01:22:38.958
<i>but end it in the middle.</i>

01:23:49.667 --> 01:23:51.625
People love their secrets.

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:54.000
They think secrets are the one thing
they can take with them when they go...

01:23:54.083 --> 01:23:55.292
but not you, Boothe.

01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:57.958
You don't get to
keep your secrets or hers.

01:24:01.292 --> 01:24:03.375
You think you want answers...

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:05.458
but you don't.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:08.458
You're blind with rage.

01:24:09.792 --> 01:24:11.833
And there's safety in that.

01:24:11.917 --> 01:24:14.542
Your ignorance protects you.

01:24:14.625 --> 01:24:18.250
'Cause when you finally see
Mae for who she really is...

01:24:18.917 --> 01:24:20.542
the truth...

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:22.917
ain't gonna set you free.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.333
It's gonna damn you.

01:24:26.292 --> 01:24:27.583
Like me.

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:39.792
You're going on a journey.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:41.625
Your destination?

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:44.167
A place and time
you've been before.

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:46.833
You were sent to Miami
to find Mae.

01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:48.667
Show me when you found her.

01:25:02.833 --> 01:25:04.417
Stay away, asshole.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.583
Is that any way
to treat an old pal?

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:07.875
I don't know you, "pal."

01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:09.708
But I know you.

01:25:09.792 --> 01:25:11.583
You're Saint Joe's old <i>niu.</i>

01:25:13.625 --> 01:25:14.833
Don't know who that is.

01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:16.458
Joe's still
got a hard-on for you.

01:25:16.542 --> 01:25:18.917
Especially when you took off
with all of his baca.

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:23.000
You're the dirty cop
he used to run with.

01:25:23.083 --> 01:25:25.042
He sent you
to bring me back?

01:25:25.125 --> 01:25:26.542
He did.

01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:28.958
But I'm an independent
contractor now.

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:34.000
Those scars a courtesy of Joe?

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:36.333
Guess I'm not the only one
who stole from him, then.

01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:39.792
I'm gonna look like the goddamn Mona Lisa
compared to what he's gonna do with you...

01:25:39.875 --> 01:25:41.667
if I hand you over.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:44.083
- Baca's gone. I sold it a long time ago.
- I'm not here for that.

01:25:44.167 --> 01:25:46.292
<i>I got a new proposition.</i>

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.583
Unless you want Joe
paying you a visit...

01:25:48.667 --> 01:25:50.625
I suggest you cooperate.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.000
What do you want me to do?

01:25:53.083 --> 01:25:54.583
I want you...

01:25:54.667 --> 01:25:55.958
to do what you do best...

01:25:57.083 --> 01:25:58.125
to this guy.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.458
It was all a setup.

01:26:04.542 --> 01:26:06.792
<i>Tell me about your friend
from the war again.</i>

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:07.792
<i>Nick.</i>

01:26:09.208 --> 01:26:10.458
Baca?

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:11.792
What do you
want to know?

01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:14.875
Hank? Oh, shit.

01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:17.167
<i>Anything that
comes to mind, really.</i>

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:21.458
Kind of women he likes,
kind of music he listens to...

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:24.792
There's this song he used
to whistle in the trenches.

01:26:33.958 --> 01:26:36.083
<i>♪ And so it seems... ♪</i>

01:26:36.167 --> 01:26:37.292
<i>She planned everything.</i>

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:39.208
<i>♪ ...that we've met... ♪</i>

01:26:39.292 --> 01:26:40.292
The song.

01:26:40.375 --> 01:26:42.958
<i>♪ ...before ♪</i>

01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:43.958
<i>The earring.</i>

01:26:46.292 --> 01:26:48.417
Oh, my God,
even the lost keys were a setup.

01:26:49.625 --> 01:26:50.833
<i>Do it again!</i>

01:26:51.875 --> 01:26:52.958
<i>You drop the keys!</i>

01:26:57.375 --> 01:26:59.208
You're gonna do it again.

01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:02.625
This whole time,
I was nothing but a mark.

01:27:02.708 --> 01:27:04.500
<i>It has been
three months.</i>

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:06.208
<i>These things take time, okay?
His partner's got the key.</i>

01:27:06.292 --> 01:27:07.750
<i>I can't figure out
his combination.</i>

01:27:07.833 --> 01:27:09.875
Liar! You're stalling!

01:27:12.542 --> 01:27:13.458
Why?

01:27:15.792 --> 01:27:17.792
Ugh!

01:27:17.875 --> 01:27:21.875
Don't tell me this gimp
screwed a conscience into you?

01:27:21.958 --> 01:27:23.750
<i>I'm touched.</i>

01:27:23.833 --> 01:27:26.333
<i>But remember,
in this line of work,</i>

01:27:26.417 --> 01:27:28.250
<i>a conscience
will get you killed.</i>

01:27:29.667 --> 01:27:31.125
This bruise,
what happened?

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:34.833
I want those files.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:38.917
Show me.

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:41.333
<i>Here they are.</i>

01:27:46.375 --> 01:27:49.208
The guy she's with,
he's that baron, isn't he?

01:27:49.292 --> 01:27:50.750
What are you gonna
do with them?

01:27:52.625 --> 01:27:54.792
I'm gonna destroy them.

01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:57.250
And all other proof
of their little tryst.

01:27:58.208 --> 01:28:00.208
What other proof?

01:28:00.292 --> 01:28:04.042
No one ever told you about
the birds and the bees, Mae?

01:28:04.125 --> 01:28:07.542
The rich, they really don't
like it when a bastard branch

01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:10.042
sprouts off of their
precious family tree.

01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:19.458
The boy,
what happened to him?

01:28:24.958 --> 01:28:25.958
<i>Hello, Elsa.</i>

01:28:27.375 --> 01:28:30.542
Oh! Sorry,
do I know you?

01:28:30.625 --> 01:28:32.875
We have
mutual friends.

01:28:34.417 --> 01:28:37.583
How's Freddie?
Is he here today?

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:40.458
Uh... what... what
do you want with Freddie?

01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:45.167
Oh, hey.
Hey, Freddie.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.375
Can, can you tell me
what this is about?

01:28:49.458 --> 01:28:51.417
You screwed
the wrong guy.

01:28:55.833 --> 01:28:57.750
No. No.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:00.083
He loved me.

01:29:00.167 --> 01:29:01.667
Said he'd take care of me.

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:03.125
Oh, yeah.

01:29:03.208 --> 01:29:04.833
He's gonna take care of both of you.

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:09.333
I did you first.
Be grateful for that.

01:29:11.667 --> 01:29:13.083
Mom?

01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:14.458
Hey, Freddie.

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:16.000
<i>Can you help me, please?</i>

01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:17.375
- Mommy?
- Come on.

01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:19.250
- Stop! Freddie, don't!
- Don't be afraid.

01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:21.042
- Come here, kid. Come on.
- No, don't!

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:22.583
- No, I want my mommy!
- Don't! No!

01:29:22.667 --> 01:29:24.292
<i>The hell are you doing?</i>

01:29:24.375 --> 01:29:25.917
What I should have
from the start.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.208
Go! Go ahead!

01:29:27.292 --> 01:29:28.333
<i>Go to the boat!</i>

01:29:29.042 --> 01:29:30.208
Get in!

01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:31.875
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

01:29:34.167 --> 01:29:35.792
- Mommy!
- Get down!

01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:38.958
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mommy...

01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:55.792
She saved him.

01:29:58.625 --> 01:30:00.917
She got away from you,
you son of a bitch.

01:30:09.417 --> 01:30:12.125
It's all right. It's all right.
You took a misstep.

01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:14.375
I led you down
a path never taken.

01:30:18.125 --> 01:30:19.292
Let's try again.

01:30:22.792 --> 01:30:25.208
Oh, my God, you did see Mae
again, didn't you?

01:30:35.792 --> 01:30:36.958
Oh, my God.

01:30:38.792 --> 01:30:40.792
We're closed!

01:30:40.875 --> 01:30:42.250
I figured you'd come back.

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:44.542
What was the plan, huh?
Run away together?

01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:47.042
Play mom and dad
to the little boy?

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:48.958
<i>Guess I'm gonna have to take
both of you out now.</i>

01:30:49.042 --> 01:30:51.667
- <i>No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait.</i>
- <i>Let's get lover boy out here.</i>

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:53.917
Nick doesn't know anything.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.542
<i>Take me. I'll come with you and I'll
tell you everything you need to know.</i>

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:56.958
Please, just don't hurt him.

01:30:59.917 --> 01:31:00.917
Get in the car.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.208
The earring.
You wanted me to find it.

01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:23.167
I love you.

01:31:27.042 --> 01:31:28.042
Mae.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
She came back.

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:34.250
Because of me.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.042
What the hell
did you do to her?

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:49.583
<i>Let's not make this more
difficult than it has to be, huh?</i>

01:31:50.417 --> 01:31:51.417
<i>Swallow.</i>

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.958
<i>Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!</i>

01:31:53.042 --> 01:31:55.708
- <i>No more. No.</i>
- <i>Undiluted baca.</i>

01:31:55.792 --> 01:31:58.750
Now, tell me,
where is the boy?

01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:04.792
<i>Soon, the baca
is gonna kick in</i>

01:32:04.875 --> 01:32:07.042
and bring back
the Mae I used to know.

01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:09.458
And when it does...

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:11.625
there's nothing
you'll hold back.

01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:13.500
Nothing you won't do.

01:32:13.583 --> 01:32:15.542
No one you won't betray.

01:32:15.625 --> 01:32:16.792
<i>Not the kid...</i>

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.708
- not your boyfriend.
- Oh, God.

01:32:19.792 --> 01:32:22.417
You'll tell me everything you know.
Understand?

01:32:30.583 --> 01:32:32.208
<i>Now, tell me
where the kid is.</i>

01:32:44.583 --> 01:32:46.292
You already know.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.667
<i>You know.</i>

01:32:52.292 --> 01:32:53.292
Mae?

01:32:54.708 --> 01:32:59.667
<i>I told you once,
don't you remember?</i>

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:03.333
<i>At first, I thought it was a
mirage floating in the waves.</i>

01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:07.625
White clapboard house.

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:12.167
<i>It saved me once.
And maybe, maybe it can save Freddie, too.</i>

01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:13.792
What are you talkin' about?

01:33:13.875 --> 01:33:14.792
Mae.

01:33:20.958 --> 01:33:22.875
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.</i>

01:33:27.792 --> 01:33:29.375
<i>But you're here now,
aren't you?</i>

01:33:33.583 --> 01:33:35.125
<i>We have this one last chance.</i>

01:33:35.208 --> 01:33:38.708
Yes, Mae, I'm here.
I'm right here.

01:33:38.792 --> 01:33:41.500
<i>There are so many things
I wanted to tell you.</i>

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:45.708
<i>But I was scared.</i>

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:50.958
<i>You looked at me in a way
no one's ever looked at me.</i>

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.375
<i>I wanted to be
that person you saw.</i>

01:33:55.667 --> 01:34:01.875
<i>It's so stupid of me to think
falling in love could save me.</i>

01:34:01.958 --> 01:34:05.083
People like us
don't fall in love.

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:09.500
We, we plummet
to places...

01:34:09.583 --> 01:34:11.208
deep and dark.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:12.833
But love?

01:34:14.458 --> 01:34:17.875
<i>Love is the thing
we climb to.</i>

01:34:17.958 --> 01:34:22.208
<i>Rung after rung, we,
we pull ourselves out of ourselves...</i>

01:34:22.292 --> 01:34:24.417
<i>reaching for something greater.</i>

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:29.542
<i>If we could
just hold on.</i>

01:34:51.375 --> 01:34:54.792
<i>I wish I could've
held on longer.</i>

01:34:57.542 --> 01:35:00.083
Stay. Stay.

01:35:00.167 --> 01:35:01.458
<i>I love you...</i>

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.542
Nick.

01:35:04.292 --> 01:35:05.625
Nick?

01:35:05.708 --> 01:35:08.667
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:10.875
The man who's gonna kill you!

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:15.958
<i>There's only one way out.</i>

01:35:16.042 --> 01:35:18.958
Mae, don't. No, no, no.
Wait, no.

01:35:19.042 --> 01:35:20.958
- <i>No, no, no.</i>
- Where do you think you're going?

01:35:21.042 --> 01:35:22.958
Mae!

01:35:23.042 --> 01:35:25.125
No, no, Mae.
Mae, Mae, Mae, no, no...

01:35:26.417 --> 01:35:27.875
<i>I can't let him
find Freddie.</i>

01:35:27.958 --> 01:35:29.042
Stay. Don't...

01:35:29.125 --> 01:35:30.167
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:33.375
No, no...
No. No!

01:35:33.458 --> 01:35:35.167
No, no, no!

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:24.250
Mae was wrong,
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:36:26.042 --> 01:36:27.542
'Cause dying is easy.

01:36:27.625 --> 01:36:30.208
A few moments of suffering
and then nothing.

01:36:30.292 --> 01:36:33.708
You deserve more than nothing.
You deserve to remember.

01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:37.708
We're going
on a journey.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:41.083
A journey down a path you tried
to forget but never could.

01:36:41.167 --> 01:36:45.083
A journey to your worst fear,
your worst pain.

01:36:45.167 --> 01:36:47.375
How did you get
your scars, Boothe?

01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:55.250
They call 'em
rats of the sky.

01:36:56.708 --> 01:36:58.583
They're just doves...

01:36:58.667 --> 01:37:00.000
with dark wings.

01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:03.667
They are as
they're made to be.

01:37:07.167 --> 01:37:08.250
Freak.

01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:10.042
I told Joe
we couldn't trust you.

01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:12.417
- Ah!
- You been skimmin' off his sales.

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.708
Of course I did.

01:37:13.792 --> 01:37:16.750
This whole town is bent.
Be crooked not to.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.625
Feel that fire?

01:37:30.708 --> 01:37:32.500
Burning like it did
that night.

01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.292
But this night will never end.

01:37:34.375 --> 01:37:37.375
This night will be with you
for the rest of your life!

01:37:37.458 --> 01:37:39.750
This is where
your journey ends!

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.500
They say you can't tell yet...

01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:08.583
but I know it's a boy.

01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:15.792
Don't bother calling security,
all right? We need to talk.

01:38:17.083 --> 01:38:18.083
Sit.

01:38:24.042 --> 01:38:27.500
For a long time, you've known about
your father's affair, haven't you?

01:38:27.583 --> 01:38:30.667
Must've been quite a shock to learn
that he'd fathered another child.

01:38:32.708 --> 01:38:34.250
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:38:34.333 --> 01:38:35.833
Sure you do.

01:38:35.917 --> 01:38:37.167
<i>He was in love
with Elsa.</i>

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:38.708
Don't worry,
my flower.

01:38:38.792 --> 01:38:40.458
<i>And vowed to protect her
and her son.</i>

01:38:40.542 --> 01:38:42.208
I'll always
take care of you.

01:38:42.292 --> 01:38:43.792
He was looking for them.

01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:46.333
He wanted to make things right
with them before he died.

01:38:46.417 --> 01:38:48.208
- Have you found her yet?
- No, Dad.

01:38:48.292 --> 01:38:50.292
Didn't wanna split
your fortune, did you?

01:38:50.375 --> 01:38:52.000
So, you hired Boothe
to kill them

01:38:52.083 --> 01:38:54.208
so you could keep
the money to yourself.

01:38:54.292 --> 01:38:55.333
Bullshit.

01:38:55.417 --> 01:38:56.667
Your own mother
tried to tell me.

01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:58.208
Walter never liked sharing.

01:38:58.292 --> 01:39:00.042
She just confused
you and your father.

01:39:01.042 --> 01:39:02.333
It's easy to see how.

01:39:03.417 --> 01:39:04.667
Mother gets confused.

01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:05.958
Not about this.

01:39:06.042 --> 01:39:08.125
Boothe proved it
with a phone call.

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:10.125
It's me.

01:39:10.208 --> 01:39:13.292
I thought he was conspiring
with a woman I knew.

01:39:13.375 --> 01:39:15.250
But I was wrong.

01:39:15.333 --> 01:39:17.125
And he couldn't have been
calling your father.

01:39:18.292 --> 01:39:20.250
Your father was
already dead.

01:39:20.333 --> 01:39:22.583
And the dead
don't take phone calls.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:24.417
But you do.

01:39:27.667 --> 01:39:28.917
Should've tossed your phone.

01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:35.792
Name your price.

01:39:37.292 --> 01:39:40.542
I'll have as much as you need
once the estate clears.

01:39:40.625 --> 01:39:42.458
I doubt that.

01:39:42.542 --> 01:39:44.583
Your half-brother Freddie, though,
he'll, he'll be quite comfortable.

01:39:46.375 --> 01:39:48.625
- Freddie, he...
- Alive, yeah.

01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:51.292
Police picked him up
early this morning.

01:39:51.375 --> 01:39:55.917
<i>Visited a white clapboard house off the
coast of the Keys where they found him...</i>

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.125
<i>safe and sound.</i>

01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:02.792
Won't be long before the cops
piece together what happened.

01:40:02.875 --> 01:40:04.125
They'll be here
for you soon.

01:40:11.208 --> 01:40:13.375
Go ahead. Do it.

01:40:35.208 --> 01:40:36.792
I won't let them
take me.

01:40:36.875 --> 01:40:38.500
Between memory
and oblivion...

01:40:39.875 --> 01:40:41.500
I know which torture
I'd choose.

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:45.750
But you've never done
your own dirty work.

01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:47.667
I doubt you have it
in you to start now.

01:40:51.792 --> 01:40:54.750
On the count of three,
imagine it.

01:40:57.250 --> 01:41:00.042
One, two...

01:41:10.417 --> 01:41:12.042
I hear it, Walter.

01:41:13.583 --> 01:41:14.708
I hear it.

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:23.833
Don't worry.
Your father is in great hands.

01:41:23.917 --> 01:41:26.125
The tank will keep his body
sustained for years.

01:41:26.208 --> 01:41:27.708
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

01:41:27.792 --> 01:41:29.333
- I'll give you guys a few minutes.
- Thank you.

01:41:34.042 --> 01:41:37.208
If you're thinking about checking
in, trust me, you cannot afford it.

01:41:37.292 --> 01:41:39.375
I burned someone
on purpose.

01:41:42.875 --> 01:41:43.958
Such a kidder.

01:41:45.375 --> 01:41:47.083
Joking about something
like that.

01:41:47.167 --> 01:41:48.875
Everyone knows that would get
you more time than murder.

01:41:48.958 --> 01:41:50.542
- It's not a joke.
- Okay.

01:41:55.333 --> 01:41:57.375
You got a death wish?

01:41:57.458 --> 01:42:00.500
The DA will pluck that little confession
right out of my head with the tank.

01:42:00.583 --> 01:42:02.417
- I want them to.
- What?

01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:07.583
- What are these?
- Reminiscences.

01:42:07.667 --> 01:42:11.292
They belong to Elsa Carine and Cyrus
Boothe, the man who killed Elsa...

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.208
and Mae.

01:42:14.167 --> 01:42:15.208
Mae is dead?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.625
I'm sorry.

01:42:19.708 --> 01:42:21.750
Take these. I need you
to get them to Avery.

01:42:22.792 --> 01:42:24.667
She'll depose me.

01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:26.083
She'll ask about you.

01:42:26.167 --> 01:42:27.083
I'm counting on it.

01:42:29.417 --> 01:42:31.083
Sorry, Watts.

01:42:31.167 --> 01:42:33.708
I'd ask someone else, but,
turns out, you're my only friend.

01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:37.167
Yeah.

01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.292
I wish I'd fired you
a long time ago.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.542
Gee, thanks.

01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:50.042
I see clearer now all
the things that I missed.

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:55.958
Your best moments
aren't behind you, Emily.

01:42:56.042 --> 01:42:58.000
They're waiting
for your arrival.

01:43:00.625 --> 01:43:01.667
Your daughter...

01:43:03.917 --> 01:43:04.917
go find her.

01:43:07.083 --> 01:43:08.250
There's still time.

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:12.167
You're acting like
I won't see you again.

01:43:13.458 --> 01:43:16.292
You'll see me.
I'll see you.

01:43:16.375 --> 01:43:18.375
You've always
been there for me.

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:21.375
I don't expect
that will change.

01:43:21.458 --> 01:43:23.875
But first, you're gonna
have to hear my confession.

01:43:28.458 --> 01:43:29.333
Okay.

01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:34.250
It started,
as you know...

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:36.125
with a set
of lost keys.

01:43:36.208 --> 01:43:38.500
Only, they were never really
lost in the first place...

01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:39.917
not even misplaced.

01:43:40.917 --> 01:43:42.667
It started as a con...

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:45.125
<i>but by the end,
it was something real.</i>

01:43:50.458 --> 01:43:55.542
<i>The city reacted swiftly
to word of Sylvan's crimes.</i>

01:43:55.625 --> 01:43:58.750
<i>Their rage against the barons
had been pent up too long.</i>

01:44:00.583 --> 01:44:02.333
<i>No walls could contain it.</i>

01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:08.500
<i>A trickle became a flood.</i>

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:13.083
<i>Maybe this time
it would wash the world clean.</i>

01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:18.375
<i>Either way...</i>

01:44:18.458 --> 01:44:19.500
<i>I won't know.</i>

01:44:32.917 --> 01:44:36.542
<i>For my role in exposing
the Sylvan conspiracy...</i>

01:44:36.625 --> 01:44:38.042
<i>Avery cut me a deal.</i>

01:44:40.292 --> 01:44:41.708
<i>I didn't get to walk...</i>

01:44:42.958 --> 01:44:44.333
<i>but I got what I wanted.</i>

01:44:59.583 --> 01:45:00.958
<i>You're going on a journey.</i>

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.542
<i>A journey through memory.</i>

01:45:06.417 --> 01:45:08.542
<i>Your destination?</i>

01:45:08.625 --> 01:45:11.417
<i>A place and time
you've been before.</i>

01:45:14.542 --> 01:45:16.042
<i>To reach it...</i>

01:45:16.125 --> 01:45:19.333
<i>all you have to do
is follow my voice.</i>

01:45:26.417 --> 01:45:28.292
<i>The past can haunt a man.</i>

01:45:29.792 --> 01:45:30.958
<i>That's what they say.</i>

01:45:33.833 --> 01:45:37.167
<i>That the past is just
a series of moments.</i>

01:45:38.333 --> 01:45:40.625
<i>Each one perfect.</i>

01:45:41.667 --> 01:45:42.792
<i>Complete.</i>

01:45:44.875 --> 01:45:47.417
<i>A bead on the necklace of time.</i>

01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:57.375
We're closed.

01:45:57.458 --> 01:45:59.417
I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.625
I lost my keys on the
way home from work.

01:46:03.042 --> 01:46:04.875
<i>The past
doesn't haunt us.</i>

01:46:06.417 --> 01:46:08.875
<i>Wouldn't even recognize us.</i>

01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:11.875
<i>♪ It seems we stood
And talked ♪</i>

01:46:11.958 --> 01:46:14.500
<i>If there are ghosts
to be found...</i>

01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:16.917
<i>it's us who haunt the past.</i>

01:46:19.667 --> 01:46:21.208
<i>We haunt it...</i>

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:22.625
<i>so we can look again.</i>

01:46:24.583 --> 01:46:26.333
<i>See the people we miss...</i>

01:46:28.125 --> 01:46:30.083
<i>and the things
we missed about them.</i>

01:46:35.208 --> 01:46:36.917
<i>I see you fully now.</i>

01:46:38.583 --> 01:46:40.542
<i>Your darkness and your light.</i>

01:46:42.583 --> 01:46:44.708
<i>Shimmering...</i>

01:46:44.792 --> 01:46:47.958
<i>like the city at dusk
when it's most beautiful.</i>

01:46:49.042 --> 01:46:50.250
Tell me a story.

01:46:52.208 --> 01:46:54.333
A story? What kind of story?

01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:57.833
One with a happy ending.

01:46:59.417 --> 01:47:01.083
No such thing
as a happy ending.

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:03.375
All endings are sad.

01:47:03.458 --> 01:47:05.417
Especially if the story
was happy.

01:47:08.208 --> 01:47:11.042
Then tell me a happy story,
but end it in the middle.

01:47:27.667 --> 01:47:28.958
- Grandma?
- Mm?

01:47:30.125 --> 01:47:31.875
You miss him...

01:47:31.958 --> 01:47:33.792
don't you?

01:47:33.875 --> 01:47:36.250
Missing people
is a part of this world.

01:47:37.458 --> 01:47:39.125
Without that sadness...

01:47:40.292 --> 01:47:41.917
you can't taste the sweet.

01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:46.958
A long time ago,
we both chose our endings.

01:47:47.833 --> 01:47:49.042
He turned back...

01:47:49.833 --> 01:47:51.125
and I looked ahead.

01:47:52.667 --> 01:47:56.750
I like to think that we both
chose right for ourselves.

01:47:56.833 --> 01:47:58.708
<i>As I held her
in my arms,</i>

01:47:58.792 --> 01:48:00.292
<i>I thought of a story.</i>

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.958
<i>It's a tragedy...</i>

01:48:04.042 --> 01:48:05.792
<i>but only if you
stop at the end.</i>

01:48:07.083 --> 01:48:09.250
Ever hear of Orpheus
and Eurydice?

01:48:11.167 --> 01:48:13.042
They were a couple
very in love.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.583
Until one day Eurydice died.

01:48:16.667 --> 01:48:18.250
That's a horrible story.

01:48:18.333 --> 01:48:19.708
I'm not in the middle yet.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.792
Orpheus descended to Hell...

01:48:22.875 --> 01:48:25.083
begged the Devil
to release her, until...

01:48:26.167 --> 01:48:28.292
finally, the Devil agreed...

01:48:28.375 --> 01:48:29.708
with one condition.

01:48:31.333 --> 01:48:33.667
He couldn't look back
until they had escaped.

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:36.792
And what happened?

01:48:39.708 --> 01:48:41.208
Orpheus took her by the hand...

01:48:42.125 --> 01:48:44.292
and led her back to life.

01:48:44.375 --> 01:48:46.500
And they lived
happily ever after?

01:48:51.042 --> 01:48:52.667
What other ending
could there be?
