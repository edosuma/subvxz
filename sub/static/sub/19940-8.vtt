We need to make it normal
for them.

09:14.570 --> 09:18.910
Well, I think I will do
whatever you think is right.

09:18.950 --> 09:21.120
Okay.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.670
Then I think it's time.

09:29.790 --> 09:31.800
Just so you know,
I'm doing really well at work.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.590
-I know.
-I'm up for a big promotion.

09:33.630 --> 09:34.800
-I know.
-I'm gonna get it,

09:34.840 --> 09:36.010
and it's gonna mean more money.

09:36.050 --> 09:38.930
-Okay. -And my father
had nothing to do with it.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.430
He'd probably be against it

09:40.470 --> 09:41.890
since it would mean
I'd be traveling a lot.

09:41.930 --> 09:43.020
You would? How much?

09:43.060 --> 09:44.230
But it would also mean that

09:44.270 --> 09:45.350
I could take care of everything.

09:45.390 --> 09:46.810
How much would you
be traveling, Joel?

09:46.850 --> 09:49.400
I could take care of you,
of the kids.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.940
You won't have to worry.

09:50.980 --> 09:53.110
I promise, I got you covered.

09:59.450 --> 10:03.080
(children laughing)

10:06.710 --> 10:08.120
He still out?

10:08.170 --> 10:10.540
Are you kidding?
He's been out since cake.

10:10.590 --> 10:12.630
The Maisel men and their sleep.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.090
Please. During the war,

10:15.130 --> 10:17.260
my father fell asleep
in a foxhole

10:17.300 --> 10:19.300
and when he woke up,
it was a beer garden.

10:19.340 --> 10:20.850
Sounds like Moishe.

10:20.890 --> 10:23.350
The oom-pah band is
what finally woke him up.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.390
(Midge chuckles)

10:25.430 --> 10:28.730
(Esther cries)

10:28.770 --> 10:30.690
MIDGE (whispers):
Need some help?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.400
JOEL (whispers):
Nope. I got it.

10:38.530 --> 10:39.660
Thanks.

10:51.670 --> 10:55.460
(piano tune plays over radio)

10:58.260 --> 11:00.640
So, Ollie the elephant
is out, huh?

11:00.680 --> 11:03.010
Yep. It happened last week.

11:03.050 --> 11:05.260
Friday morning Ollie was in,
then by dinnertime,

11:05.310 --> 11:06.680
suddenly it was Louis the lion.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.270
Not sure what happened.

11:08.310 --> 11:09.850
Wow.

11:09.890 --> 11:13.020
Sorry, pal.
Life is cold.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.900
Do you remember when we
bought that for him?

11:14.940 --> 11:17.650
I believe it was to
stop a whole lot of screaming.

11:17.690 --> 11:20.110
-Smallpox vaccination.
-Yeah.

11:20.150 --> 11:23.870
He was never gonna be bought off
by a lollipop alone.

11:23.910 --> 11:25.490
What are you doing?

11:25.540 --> 11:27.080
I'm eating.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.120
I can see.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.660
Should I be timing you?

11:29.710 --> 11:31.120
There might be a prize in it
or something.

11:31.170 --> 11:32.580
I'm just so hungry.

11:32.630 --> 11:33.540
That from the party?

11:33.580 --> 11:35.380
I made an extra tray.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.340
I should never cook
while hungover.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.550
-Do you want some?
-Uh...

11:39.590 --> 11:42.090
Are Abe and Rose gonna be home
any time soon?

11:42.140 --> 11:45.260
Papa's at a work gathering,
Mama's with the garden club.

11:45.300 --> 11:49.600
Nights are very quiet
and very separate recently.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.270
Come on. Sit.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.520
Okay.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.270
There any beer in the fridge?

11:56.320 --> 11:57.980
Look in the back.

11:58.030 --> 12:00.280
Mama doesn't like
to look at beer.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.490
It makes her think
of venereal disease.

12:02.530 --> 12:06.080
(Joel chuckles)

12:06.120 --> 12:08.410
The party seemed successful.

12:08.450 --> 12:09.870
Only one kid shoved an acorn
up his nose.

12:09.910 --> 12:10.910
Mendel?

12:10.960 --> 12:12.870
-Yep.
-Well,

12:12.920 --> 12:14.290
when you got a talent...

12:14.330 --> 12:15.500
Mm.

12:19.010 --> 12:20.880
I noticed the new
dining room.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.930
Yep.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.010
You were not kidding.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.850
I hope this thing
works itself out soon.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.520
I hate to see my parents
like this.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.980
It will.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.440
They'll realize it's
a mistake to be apart.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.320
They will realize that
they belong together,

12:37.360 --> 12:40.150
and they'll fix it
before it's too late.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.490
Abe and Rose are very smart.

16:50.150 --> 16:51.940
...was the week before
our wedding.

16:51.990 --> 16:54.110
That's right.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.200
I remember laying here
thinking,

16:58.240 --> 17:02.330
"In one week, I'll be married
to Miriam Weissman,

17:02.370 --> 17:04.540
"the most beautiful girl
in the world.

17:04.579 --> 17:09.960
"And I'll have a wife,
and we'll have our own home,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.130
"and we'll have two kids,

17:12.170 --> 17:15.470
"and I'll never, ever
have to have sex

17:15.510 --> 17:17.970
in front of the Dionne
quintuplets again."

17:18.010 --> 17:20.680
Best-laid plans.

17:20.720 --> 17:24.099
And now here we are.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.849
You're back
in your parents' house,

17:25.900 --> 17:28.020
I'm back in mine.

17:28.060 --> 17:31.230
Very strange.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.320
-I've got a curfew.
-You're kidding.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.780
-And chores.
-Wow.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.070
I have a job.

17:36.110 --> 17:37.280
I heard about the job.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.530
Saving up for a TV set

17:38.570 --> 17:40.280
and some roller skates.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.040
Well, I got some
roller skates.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.620
They have Buck Rogers on them.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.290
Redd Foxx?
What's this?

17:48.330 --> 17:50.290
That's called a party album.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.460
Sort of underground comedy.

17:52.510 --> 17:53.670
Why underground?

17:53.710 --> 17:55.510
I don't know.
They're dirty,

17:55.550 --> 17:57.760
but really funny.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.310
"The Music Inn"?

18:02.350 --> 18:04.060
That's the place I got 'em.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.230
On 4th.
Right near the Gaslight.

18:06.270 --> 18:08.810
-You'd love it.
-Hanging out

18:08.850 --> 18:10.520
at record stores
in the Village,

18:10.560 --> 18:13.610
working in a department store...

18:13.650 --> 18:15.740
Went to a protest
in Washington Square Park.

18:15.780 --> 18:17.320
Do you know they want
to put a road

18:17.360 --> 18:18.410
right through the middle
of the arch?

18:18.450 --> 18:20.280
-What for?
-I don't know.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.830
Progress.

18:21.870 --> 18:25.960
Progress?
Right.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.620
Progress.

18:27.670 --> 18:30.420
Things move on, I guess.

18:32.460 --> 18:35.840
How did I screw everything up
so badly?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.970
I never said I'm sorry,
did I?

18:38.010 --> 18:41.430
I don't know.
Maybe.

18:41.470 --> 18:43.970
I should have come back
on my knees that night.

18:44.010 --> 18:47.310
Bought you flowers.

18:47.350 --> 18:48.770
I should have...

18:48.810 --> 18:52.060
Never should have left
in the first place.

18:52.110 --> 18:56.110
You just have to understand...

18:56.150 --> 18:58.450
you are a lot, Midge.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.110
A lot of what?

19:04.950 --> 19:07.330
You meet a girl.

19:07.370 --> 19:09.830
Maybe she's pretty,

19:09.870 --> 19:12.540
maybe she's smart,

19:12.590 --> 19:15.630
maybe she's funny.

19:15.670 --> 19:18.340
Maybe your parents
like her.

19:18.380 --> 19:19.680
Maybe you get really lucky,

19:19.720 --> 19:22.720
and she's one or two
of those things.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.060
I got 'em all.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.720
That's a lot.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.230
It wasn't enough, though.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.940
It was.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.610
It was more than enough.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.150
I fell in love with you

19:37.190 --> 19:39.700
the moment I asked you out,
and you said no.

19:39.740 --> 19:41.110
A pointless "no."

19:41.160 --> 19:42.870
The first time
I laid eyes on you,

19:42.910 --> 19:43.990
that was it for me.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.870
Until you left.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.580
I never left.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.830
I don't know what I did, but...

19:51.870 --> 19:53.170
I never really left.

19:53.210 --> 19:56.630
Sure felt like you left.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.760
What can I do, Midge?

20:03.800 --> 20:07.220
What can I do to...

20:07.260 --> 20:09.770
I love you.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.730
Do you know that?

20:12.770 --> 20:16.190
Do you know that I love you?

20:18.820 --> 20:20.490
So, what happens now?

20:20.530 --> 20:22.280
What do you want
to happen?

20:23.740 --> 20:26.620
Because whatever it is,
I will do it.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.000
Just tell me what you want.

20:33.370 --> 20:36.250
(whispers):
I want your roller skates.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.800
(chuckles)

20:49.930 --> 20:51.140
(bicycle bell jingles)

20:52.560 --> 20:54.600
(milk bottles clinking)

20:59.900 --> 21:01.440
(loud thud in kitchen)

21:01.490 --> 21:02.740
-Oh, no.
-What?

21:02.780 --> 21:04.570
Shh. We fell asleep.

21:04.610 --> 21:05.910
We weren't supposed
to fall asleep.

21:05.950 --> 21:06.990
-I was...
-Shh.

21:07.030 --> 21:08.450
That sounds like eggs.

21:08.490 --> 21:09.620
Does that sound like eggs?

21:09.660 --> 21:10.660
-It...
-Shh.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.080
ROSE:
Morning, Zelda.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.290
ZELDA:
I'm making eggs, Mrs. Weissman.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.290
See? Shit!
Eggs. Shit!

21:15.330 --> 21:16.750
-Midge...
-We fell asleep.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.210
I can't believe we fell asleep
in my room.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.300
-So what? -There are poodles
in here, Joel.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.710
Dozens of 'em.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.380
We've had sex in your room
before, Midge.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.010
Not since we've been married.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.220
Well, you got me there.

21:26.260 --> 21:27.590
You have to go.

21:27.640 --> 21:31.180
Wait. What...
What are you doing?

21:31.220 --> 21:33.020
I... this is not the way
to make me go,

21:33.060 --> 21:34.230
in case there was
a question.

21:34.270 --> 21:35.350
Get your clothes.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.650
(chuckling)

21:36.690 --> 21:38.400
You get your clothes,
you leave,

21:38.440 --> 21:39.860
they'll never know.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.990
Oh, to have a camera
right now.

21:43.030 --> 21:44.700
-Get dressed.
-Midge, I...

21:44.740 --> 21:46.280
-You have to get dressed.
-But I...

21:46.320 --> 21:47.950
You get dressed
and climb out the window,

21:47.990 --> 21:49.200
just like you used to.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.660
Yes, good,
climb out the window,

21:50.700 --> 21:52.080
go from the fire escape
to the roof,

21:52.120 --> 21:53.500
and take the freight elevator
back down.

21:53.540 --> 21:55.540
Will you stop?
Will you just...

21:55.580 --> 21:57.330
You should try out
for the Yankees.

21:57.370 --> 21:59.540
MIDGE:
Shoes, belt, socks.

21:59.590 --> 22:02.380
Where are your socks?
Where are your socks?

22:02.420 --> 22:04.670
Where are your socks?
What'd you do with your socks?

22:04.720 --> 22:06.300
Oh, they're in your shoes.

22:06.340 --> 22:08.090
At some point last night
you stopped to put your socks

22:08.140 --> 22:09.800
-in your shoes?
-I didn't, I...

22:09.850 --> 22:11.680
Why are you slow?
Were you always this slow?

22:11.720 --> 22:12.970
I haven't panic-dressed
in a while.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.850
Go! You can finish outside.

22:14.890 --> 22:17.270
Okay, okay, calm down.
I'm going.

22:17.310 --> 22:19.060
Oh, wait.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.690
I think I left my wallet
in the kitchen.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.650
-Let me just, uh...
-This isn't funny.

22:22.690 --> 22:26.070
ROSE:
Miriam? Are you up?

22:26.110 --> 22:27.320
If not, get up.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.200
I'm up.
I'll be right there.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.830
-Joel, please, just...
-I'm going.

22:31.870 --> 22:33.410
Geez, it's freezing.

22:33.450 --> 22:35.700
This window seemed bigger
five years ago.

22:35.750 --> 22:36.790
ROSE:
No, no cheese.

22:36.830 --> 22:38.750
No cheese from now on, ever.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.630
-(whispering): Hey.
-What?

22:52.180 --> 22:54.060
Did you always look
like this in the morning?

22:54.100 --> 22:56.100
You got to go.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.610
Morning, Mama.
Morning, Zelda.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.240
My goodness, the coffee smells
especially amazing today.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.150
You know those days when coffee
just smells extra amazing?

23:09.200 --> 23:12.030
Yes, those are wonderful days.
What are you wearing?

23:12.070 --> 23:14.160
This is a robe.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.910
Yes. I stand by
my previous statement.

23:16.950 --> 23:19.120
Your face is a mess.
Your hair is a mess.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.290
So it's a theme.
No, I just, I-I had...

23:22.330 --> 23:24.500
I had a dream
I was on a safari,

23:24.550 --> 23:27.090
and there was no place for me
to get my hair done.

23:27.130 --> 23:29.090
And all my bags got lost,

23:29.130 --> 23:30.760
and a lion chased me
and ate my purse.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.300
And when I woke up,
I looked like this.

23:32.340 --> 23:35.430
So, that is the last time
that I... dream.

23:38.890 --> 23:40.310
My room's a mess.

23:40.350 --> 23:42.560
Wouldn't want you
to dock my allowance.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.060
Good morning, Papa.

23:44.110 --> 23:45.270
Want to hear about
my safari dream?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.530
It's the reason
I look like this.

23:46.570 --> 23:48.440
Like what?

23:48.490 --> 23:49.990
Coffee sure smells good, huh?

23:50.030 --> 23:51.530
-Smells like coffee.
-Mm.

23:51.570 --> 23:52.610
Good morning, Zelda.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.030
Good morning, Mr. Weissman.

23:54.070 --> 23:55.530
-Good morning, Ro...
-I'll take my breakfast

23:55.580 --> 23:57.330
in the dining room, Zelda.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.500
Will you be joining
Mrs. Weissman?

23:59.540 --> 24:01.830
In the dining room?

24:01.870 --> 24:04.750
No, I won't.

24:04.790 --> 24:06.960
Bye, Papa.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.380
(knife clatters)

24:08.420 --> 24:10.130
What?

24:10.170 --> 24:12.840
The coffee smells
very good this morning.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.510
(laughs softly)

24:16.510 --> 24:18.680
DON:
"Belter Chemical Company

24:18.720 --> 24:19.930
"of Pasadena, California

24:19.980 --> 24:21.690
specializes
in Bakelite production."

24:21.730 --> 24:23.190
Got to speak up, Donny.

24:23.230 --> 24:25.770
"But their profits
have seen a steady decline

24:25.810 --> 24:26.980
"ever since the war ended.

24:27.020 --> 24:28.400
"Not only is there no need

24:28.440 --> 24:30.240
-for pilot goggles..."
-Yada, yada, yada.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.200
You got to pace it up. You're
boring the shit out of me.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.660
-Archie? -Hmm, what?
Is Donny still talking?

24:34.700 --> 24:36.410
-Screw you, Archie.
-JOEL: Okay.

24:36.450 --> 24:38.450
Let's say Donny finishes
and everyone's still conscious.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.370
-Thank you, thank you very much.
-You'll step in

24:40.410 --> 24:41.830
with the Belter profit
and loss records.

24:41.870 --> 24:43.420
Play up the bad, which means...

24:43.460 --> 24:45.630
We swoop in with a lowball offer
that they will jump at!

24:45.670 --> 24:48.000
Hear that, Donny?
It's called having a pulse.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.670
I'm being ganged up on here,
Mrs. Moskowitz.

24:49.710 --> 24:51.050
Play nice, boys.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.880
Archie finishes,
then I'll bring it home.

24:52.930 --> 24:55.470
There will be lots of
figures, lots of fireworks.

24:55.510 --> 24:58.010
I'll throw around words
like "phenolic resins."

24:58.060 --> 25:00.680
-Oh! -Oh! -Catalin,
Faturan and Crystalate...

25:00.720 --> 25:02.310
I hear they're headlining
at the Apollo next week.

25:02.350 --> 25:04.020
-Then I'll point to charts!
-Charts! -Charts!

25:04.060 --> 25:05.100
-And graphs!
-Graphs! -Graphs!

25:05.150 --> 25:06.940
I'll dazzle them with bullshit,

25:06.980 --> 25:08.980
and then we'll hand out some
very nice color-coded binders,

25:09.020 --> 25:10.480
and as they all start to read,

25:10.530 --> 25:12.240
I'll sum up the
presentation with the words,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.860
"The future is ours.
And we will take it!"

25:14.910 --> 25:17.030
-(cheering)
-Well.

25:17.070 --> 25:18.280
We're ready, men.

25:18.330 --> 25:20.540
-Get a shave, press your suits.
-Oh.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.080
I don't think Don
should wear his Grey suit.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.670
It makes him look tubby.

25:24.710 --> 25:25.920
Et Tu, Mrs. Moskowitz?

25:25.960 --> 25:27.460
JOEL:
You heard her, Donny.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.500
-You're tubby in the Grey.
-ARCHIE: Boy,

25:28.540 --> 25:30.050
are you in a good mood.

25:30.090 --> 25:31.710
(chuckling): He's been
in a good mood all day.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.050
Something making you
extra happy?

25:33.090 --> 25:35.010
Something you can share?
Or pour?

25:35.050 --> 25:37.840
-Well, I wasn't gonna say
anything. -ARCHIE: About what?

25:37.890 --> 25:41.810
It's not a done deal yet, but
it looks like maybe Midge and I

25:41.850 --> 25:43.680
-might give it another go.
-DON: You're kidding.

25:43.730 --> 25:46.100
Oh, thank God. Thank you, God.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.560
-Easy, boy.
-You don't understand.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.400
You have no idea
what it's been like with Imogene

25:49.440 --> 25:51.650
since the two of you split.
She's gone crazy.

25:51.690 --> 25:53.490
Wasn't that long a trip, pal.
I got news for you.

25:53.530 --> 25:55.530
She's obsessed
with my every move.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.240
Where have I been,
what am I doing?

25:57.280 --> 25:59.070
I spilled ketchup
on my shirt one day,

25:59.120 --> 26:00.910
and she goes over to my
secretary's apartment

26:00.950 --> 26:04.450
and compares all her
lipstick color to the stain.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.660
-Ooh! -Can I tell her
about Midge?

26:05.710 --> 26:06.750
(laughs):
Please, let me tell her.

26:06.790 --> 26:08.460
Not just yet, but soon.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.210
In the meantime, after work
tonight, drinks are on me.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.010
-(laughs) -Oh!
-You, too, Mrs. Moskowitz!

26:14.050 --> 26:17.010
(chuckles) I can't wait
to meet Mrs. Maisel.

26:17.050 --> 26:18.720
I bet she's a pretty
wonderful girl.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.760
Oh, she is, Mrs. Moskowitz.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.350
-She is at that.
-(chuckles)

26:32.610 --> 26:35.990
(muttering)

26:36.030 --> 26:37.490
No.

26:37.530 --> 26:39.570
Hey, what's funnier,
corned beef or pastrami?

26:39.610 --> 26:41.240
Pastrami.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.870
(quietly):
"Pastrami..."

26:43.910 --> 26:46.000
That is funnier.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.460
Thank you!

26:47.500 --> 26:48.620

26:57.090 --> 26:58.930
He could just be

26:58.970 --> 27:00.430

27:03.760 --> 27:05.560
I'm going to church
with my family.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.690

27:10.940 --> 27:13.110

It's snowing.

27:13.150 --> 27:14.480
I love the snow.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.980
Don't you love the snow?

27:16.030 --> 27:17.150
I do love the snow.

27:17.190 --> 27:18.650
I think the snow is good luck.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.320
Depends on how far
you have to walk.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.870
My wedding had a Russian
winter wonderland theme.

27:22.910 --> 27:24.580
You know, like
Doctor Zhivago.

27:24.620 --> 27:26.950
You had a medical themed
wedding? That's really weird.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.330
Doctor Zhivago is a book.
Don't make us look stupid.

27:29.370 --> 27:31.830
Everything was white,
and there were trees painted

27:31.880 --> 27:33.290
like they were covered
with snow.

27:33.340 --> 27:35.920
It was really,
really beautiful.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.380
What are you doing
tonight, Midge?

27:37.420 --> 27:39.260
-Oh, I have plans.
-Hmm.

27:39.300 --> 27:40.880
Is it something wonderful?

27:40.930 --> 27:43.010
It is. It is
something wonderful.

27:43.050 --> 27:44.810
That's good. Because tonight,

27:44.850 --> 27:46.930
everyone should do
something wonderful.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.290
it's not funny
unless you hit "licking."

28:11.330 --> 28:13.420
Right. Licking the lamp post.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.380
Licking the lamp post.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.000
Jesus, how long
are we gonna be sitting here?

28:17.050 --> 28:18.710
You're supposed
to go on at 8:00.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.380
When you said "shit gig,"
this is exactly what I pictured.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.680
Yeah, this place
is pretty much the worst.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.680
Now, remember, the audience
out there will be terrible.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.930
All right?
They're gonna be drunk,

28:26.970 --> 28:28.720
horny and in no mood to laugh.

28:28.770 --> 28:30.430
There's pretty much no chance
you're gonna win them over,

28:30.480 --> 28:32.140
even if you do show them
your tits,

28:32.190 --> 28:34.560
'cause there's a lot of tits
to look at in here.

28:35.770 --> 28:37.320
I'm sorry, was that the end
of the pep talk?

28:37.360 --> 28:38.730
Just keep going.

28:38.780 --> 28:40.400
No matter what they toss at you,
keep going.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.740
-Okay. -Duck, you know,
but keep going.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.580
-So, Susie.
-Yes?

28:46.620 --> 28:48.540
I'm gonna tell you something.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.450
-Okay. -I'm just gonna say it,
because I want you to hear it,

28:50.500 --> 28:52.000
and after I say it
and after you hear it,

28:52.040 --> 28:53.330
we are not gonna
discuss it again.

28:53.370 --> 28:55.380
I just want you to hear it,

28:55.420 --> 28:56.630
because we are
in business together,

28:56.670 --> 28:57.920
and we spend time together

28:57.960 --> 29:00.170
and it could come up
occasionally.

29:00.210 --> 29:01.300
And I don't want to keep
anything from you.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.630
But I don't want you
to be surprised

29:02.670 --> 29:03.880
-if I accidentally...
-What is this?

29:03.930 --> 29:05.090
The lost Hamlet monologue?

29:05.140 --> 29:06.340
Just say it, for Christ's sake.

29:06.390 --> 29:07.850
I spent the night with Joel.

29:07.890 --> 29:10.640
After Ethan's party,
he spent the night.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.980
And we... spent the night.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.190
So there.

29:15.230 --> 29:16.810
I told you. You know it.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.690
We are not gonna
talk about it again.

29:20.980 --> 29:23.110
Who's Joel?

29:23.150 --> 29:25.610
My husband.

29:25.660 --> 29:27.370
You slept with your husband?

29:27.410 --> 29:28.530
He was such an asshole.

29:28.580 --> 29:29.990
We are not gonna talk about it.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.620
Are you getting back together
with him?

29:31.660 --> 29:33.540
I just thought I should tell you
in case it came up...

29:33.580 --> 29:34.750
In case what?

29:34.790 --> 29:36.290
We are not gonna talk about it.

29:36.330 --> 29:37.750
-You are, aren't you?
-Not talking about it.

29:37.790 --> 29:39.840
-But...
-Not talking about.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.630
-MAN: Susie Myerson!
-Yeah.

29:41.670 --> 29:46.010
We'll continue not talking
about it when I get back.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.890
You slept with your husband?

29:49.930 --> 29:52.270
Yes.

29:52.310 --> 29:54.850
Aren't you supposed to sleep
with your husband? I'm confused.

29:54.890 --> 29:57.020
Well, we've been
separated for a while,

29:57.060 --> 29:58.730
so it was, it was
a little unexpected.

29:58.770 --> 30:00.940
Well, your boyfriend took it
pretty well, considering.

30:00.980 --> 30:02.610
Oh, Susie's not my boyfriend.

30:02.650 --> 30:03.780
She's my manager.

30:03.820 --> 30:05.360
Strippers got managers now?

30:05.400 --> 30:06.570
I-I'm not a stripper.

30:06.610 --> 30:07.700
What are you?

30:07.740 --> 30:08.820
I'm a comic.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.160
Ooh, tough way to make a living.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.160
(laughter)

30:14.200 --> 30:15.620
Get your coat.

30:15.660 --> 30:16.920
Why?

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
-Just get it. Let's go.
-Susie.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.090
They canceled us, okay?
You happy?

30:21.130 --> 30:22.380
What are you talking about,
"canceled"?

30:22.420 --> 30:23.800
They just told me,
they got someone else

30:23.840 --> 30:25.010
for your spot tonight.

30:25.050 --> 30:25.970
Why?

30:26.010 --> 30:27.090
Why do you think?

30:27.130 --> 30:28.470
Harry fucking Drake.

30:28.510 --> 30:29.930
Are you kidding?
How did he even know

30:29.970 --> 30:31.260
about this stupid gig?

30:31.300 --> 30:33.810
-Oh, I told him.
-Why?

30:33.850 --> 30:35.390
'Cause I'm the world's
biggest idiot.

30:35.430 --> 30:37.390
And you can bet
if he cost us this loser gig,

30:37.440 --> 30:39.600
he's probably gonna cost us
the other loser gig, also.

30:39.650 --> 30:41.860
Well, they're blackballing
Amanda Gleason, not me.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.900
I-I could change my
name to Trudy Macintosh.

30:43.940 --> 30:45.860
Well, he knows my name, Trudy.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.610
And they're not dealing with me,
and I'm your manager. Right?

30:48.660 --> 30:49.950
Yes. Of course.

30:49.990 --> 30:51.320
Right?

30:51.370 --> 30:53.160
Yes. Susie, please.
We're a team.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.080
Okay.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.330
So what do we do now?

30:56.370 --> 30:57.540
I don't know.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.540
Shit, shit, shit.

30:59.580 --> 31:02.250
(quietly):
Cunt.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.130
It's a good thing
you don't have a career anymore,

31:04.170 --> 31:05.380
'cause that loser husband
of yours

31:05.420 --> 31:08.170
would never have
let you do this anyway.

31:13.510 --> 31:15.890
I'll fly out of here,
like a bird.

31:15.930 --> 31:18.560
Like a bird, like a bird.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.020
I'll run out of here,
like a deer.

31:21.060 --> 31:23.570
Like a deer, like a deer.

31:23.610 --> 31:26.030
MAN: I'll swim out of here,
like a fish.

31:26.070 --> 31:28.700
-WOMEN: Like a fish,
like a fish. -Back table.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.990
MAN: I'll climb out of here,
like an ape.

31:31.030 --> 31:34.160
-What's he doing here?
-Fuck if I'm gonna ask.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.410
MAN: I'll slink out of here,
like a snake.

31:36.450 --> 31:38.160
WOMEN: Like a snake,
like a snake.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.500
-Hey boss, nice to... -Who
the hell is Amanda Gleason?

31:41.540 --> 31:44.340
-Why? -Word is she's
persona non grata.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.590
Harry Drake himself
made the call.

31:46.630 --> 31:49.720
The last time I talked to
Harry Drake was ten years ago,

31:49.760 --> 31:51.550
when the same whore
gave us both the clap.

31:51.590 --> 31:52.840
-That's a nice story.
-He's saying

31:52.890 --> 31:54.470
Amanda Gleason better not
come within ten feet

31:54.510 --> 31:56.220
of the Gaslight.

31:56.260 --> 31:58.850
If she does, he'll make
sure anyone who performs here

31:58.890 --> 32:00.890
will never work
on the East Coast again.

32:00.940 --> 32:02.850
Look, Harry
is a legendary drunk.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.690
And he's saying
you screwed him over.

32:04.730 --> 32:06.190
-Did you do that?
-(stammers)

32:06.230 --> 32:07.480
At least I didn't
give him the clap.

32:07.530 --> 32:09.530
Who is Amanda Gleason, Susie?

32:09.570 --> 32:10.950
-She's a comic I'm managing.
-Well, see if you can

32:10.990 --> 32:12.160
manage to keep her out of here.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.910
-Eddie...
-Don't book her,

32:13.950 --> 32:15.580
don't give her a slot.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.790
Don't let her use the john.
Nothing. You got it?

32:17.830 --> 32:19.580
You'd feel different
if you'd heard her act.

32:19.620 --> 32:20.790
Susie, listen to me.

32:20.830 --> 32:22.540
You've done a good job here

32:22.580 --> 32:25.960
with Baz off in the tundra,
or wherever the hell he is.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.300
But I need you to stand down
for a while.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.510
What does that mean?

32:29.550 --> 32:31.800
It means let Jackie run things.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.760
Let him put
the lineups together.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.600
You stay away from anything
having to do with the talent.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.600
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-Run the door.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.390
I would rather clean gum
off the floor.

32:40.430 --> 32:43.440
Sit your ass on that stool
and take people's money.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.940
No fucking way.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.770
You want to take that sunny,
people-pleasing attitude

32:46.820 --> 32:49.650
of yours and go look
for another job? Go ahead.

32:49.690 --> 32:51.950
Rikers might be hiring. Okay.

32:51.990 --> 32:54.240
We're clear. I'm leaving.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.780
It's nice seeing you.

32:55.820 --> 32:58.950
Don't make me
come down here again.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.870
-MAN: Snake.
-WOMEN: Snake,

33:00.910 --> 33:02.790
snake, snake, snake.

33:02.830 --> 33:05.920
Snake.

34:35.469 --> 34:37.050
I want postcards from Paris.

34:37.090 --> 34:38.219
Mais oui.

34:38.260 --> 34:39.340
Hey!

34:39.389 --> 34:41.050
Penny.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.560
-What are you... -I have been
all over town looking for you.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.679
-Penny, I'm working right now.
-Oh, I know.

34:45.730 --> 34:47.350
I know you're working
because Joel said you worked

34:47.389 --> 34:48.650
in a department store.

34:48.690 --> 34:50.020
He just didn't say which one.

34:50.060 --> 34:52.230
So I went to all of them.

34:52.270 --> 34:54.530
I went to Saks.
I went to Bergdorf's.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.780
I went to Macy's.
I went to Gimbels.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.110
They're across the street from
each other, so that was easy.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.370
I went to Lord & Taylor's.

35:00.410 --> 35:01.570
I went to Bendel's,
even though I thought,

35:01.620 --> 35:02.660
"She wouldn't shop at Bendel's,"

35:02.700 --> 35:03.910
but it's not really about

35:03.950 --> 35:05.500
where you would shop, is it?

35:05.540 --> 35:07.330
-Not really. Look, can we...
-I almost gave up.

35:07.370 --> 35:10.040
But I decided, "No,
I'll give it one more try."

35:10.080 --> 35:12.250
And I came here,
and here you are.

35:12.290 --> 35:15.170
-Yes. Look...
-I know all about you and Joel.

35:15.210 --> 35:17.090
I know that you spent
the night together.

35:17.130 --> 35:18.800
And I think that's rotten.
It's mean

35:18.840 --> 35:20.680
and it's spiteful and vindictive

35:20.720 --> 35:22.100
and I don't understand
why you'd do it.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.560
Wow. Where's a fainting couch
when you need one?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.430
Joel and I were happy.

35:25.470 --> 35:26.850
-Oh, boy.
-I made him happy.

35:26.890 --> 35:28.770
-He moved out, Penny.
-Not really.

35:28.810 --> 35:30.400
-Are his things there?
-There's socks.

35:30.440 --> 35:32.610
Socks? Or just a sock?

35:32.650 --> 35:34.150
He moved out. You broke up.

35:34.190 --> 35:35.570
No. We did not break up.

35:35.610 --> 35:37.690
Joel never said the words,
"We broke up."

35:37.740 --> 35:39.740
-What words did he say?
-Other words.

35:39.780 --> 35:41.280
Other words that basically
amount to "we broke up"?

35:41.320 --> 35:42.950
I was good for him.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.990
Better for him than you were.
He relaxed around me.

35:45.030 --> 35:46.950
He'd come home at night
and fall right to sleep.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.660
Boy, you are making it
way too easy.

35:48.710 --> 35:50.120
If you had just let go,
if you had just...

35:50.160 --> 35:51.540
He never took off
his wedding ring.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.960
You didn't think
that was strange?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.380
The stress of everything
made his fingers swell.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.920
Penny, you don't really
believe that, do you?

36:01.550 --> 36:03.390
He would've forgotten you.

36:03.430 --> 36:06.350
You just did something.

36:06.390 --> 36:08.560
You need to go.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.850
You did sleep together,
didn't you?

36:11.900 --> 36:14.730
-Yes.
-Tramp!

36:14.770 --> 36:16.770
That's what I went
to seven different

36:16.820 --> 36:18.110
department stores to say!

36:18.150 --> 36:20.820
You are a tramp!

36:23.320 --> 36:25.240
We need to have a talk.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.370
Bring your handbook.

36:35.750 --> 36:36.790
What do you do?

36:36.840 --> 36:38.170
Spoken word with tambourine.

36:38.210 --> 36:39.960
Your parents must be thrilled.

36:40.010 --> 36:42.220
Okay. 8:30.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.380
Can I get some change?

36:43.430 --> 36:44.890
Fuck off.

36:44.930 --> 36:47.680
Oh, yeah. Singles okay?

36:47.720 --> 36:48.680
What do you do?

36:48.720 --> 36:50.680
Carter Family covers.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.440
11:30.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.270
How'd you get Imogene to let you
come out with me tonight?

36:54.310 --> 36:55.810
I explained this is a big deal
for you.

36:55.860 --> 36:57.690
You needed your second
by your side.

36:57.730 --> 36:59.360
So if I bomb, you're going up?

36:59.400 --> 37:00.940
Nope. You bomb,
I look the other way.

37:00.990 --> 37:03.660
Never met you.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.320
Hi, there.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.410
-Remember me?
-No.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.660
-I'm the one with the brisket.
-No.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.500
Actually, my wife
would bring the brisket,

37:11.540 --> 37:13.580
but it was for me
to get me a spot.

37:13.620 --> 37:16.000
So, how about I owe you a
brisket and you give me a spot?

37:16.040 --> 37:17.210
No.

37:17.250 --> 37:20.510
Okay. Hey, that
is a great blouse.

37:20.550 --> 37:21.670
Barking up the wrong tree, pal.

37:21.710 --> 37:23.720
Right. Look,
I'd really love a spot.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.300
Anything you could do?

37:25.340 --> 37:27.390
I don't give out
the spots anymore.

37:27.430 --> 37:28.640
Got to talk to him.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.970
Tell him he's got a nice ass.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.680
That usually works.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.480
Okay, thanks.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.230
Hi.

37:36.270 --> 37:38.480
I'm a comedian.
I'd like a slot tonight.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.690
Sorry, pal. All full.

37:39.730 --> 37:41.650
You sure?

37:41.690 --> 37:45.990
Just gave the last one
to that guy or that guy.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.740
I don't know. One of those guys
got the last slot.

37:48.780 --> 37:51.240
What if I come back tonight
just in case someone drops out?

37:51.290 --> 37:54.040
That's a pretty
fucking stupid idea.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.710
Okay.
Then I'll try again tomorrow.

37:55.750 --> 37:57.500
And the next day,
and the day after that

37:57.540 --> 37:59.170
because I am going
to get a slot

37:59.210 --> 38:01.710
and I am going to get back up
on that stage.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.130
Cue the orchestra.

38:03.170 --> 38:06.130
What do I care?
Come back whenever you want.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.640
Let's go, Arch.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.010
Mr. Persistency.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.350
This is what Midge wanted.

38:10.390 --> 38:11.970
She wanted me to be a comedian

38:12.020 --> 38:13.430
and I just didn't
try hard enough.

38:13.470 --> 38:15.440
So, now, I do this for Midge

38:15.480 --> 38:18.940
because from now on,
she gets everything she wants.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.190
MIDGE:
Papa?

38:30.320 --> 38:32.580
(thumping)

38:32.620 --> 38:34.250
Papa?

38:34.290 --> 38:36.000
ABE:
Yes?

38:38.040 --> 38:39.380
What are you doing?

38:39.420 --> 38:41.290
Alphabetizing my books.

38:41.340 --> 38:43.500
Can I talk to you for a moment?

38:43.550 --> 38:46.010
Okay.

38:46.050 --> 38:48.130
Are you... y-you're gonna do it
from there?

38:48.180 --> 38:50.430
I think that's what
we're looking at, yes.

38:50.470 --> 38:52.060
Okay.

38:52.100 --> 38:57.140
Well, I just wanted to tell you
that Joel and I

38:57.190 --> 38:58.980
might be getting back together.

38:59.020 --> 39:03.650
Are you kidding me?

39:03.690 --> 39:07.450
After what you put your mother
and me through,

39:07.490 --> 39:09.570
you have the nerve
to come in here and tell me

39:09.610 --> 39:11.870
you're getting back together?

39:11.910 --> 39:14.410
-I...
-She's not speaking to me.

39:14.450 --> 39:16.450
She took my study. Look at me.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.080
Look at what I have
to do every single day

39:19.120 --> 39:20.630
because you wouldn't
let Joel come back!

39:20.670 --> 39:22.590
-I'm sorry.
-No!

39:22.630 --> 39:25.250
-"No" what?
-No, I forbid it.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.880
You forbid me to get back
together with my husband?

39:27.920 --> 39:30.260
Yes, I forbid it.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.890
You have laid waste
to everyone and everything

39:33.930 --> 39:35.850
around you.

39:35.890 --> 39:37.430
It's been like a typhoon.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.640
The Red Cross should start
handing out blankets.

39:39.690 --> 39:41.600
You have ruined everybody's life

39:41.650 --> 39:44.900
and now that there's no more
havoc to wreak,

39:44.940 --> 39:46.320
you want to get back together

39:46.360 --> 39:49.110
and be happy. No.

39:49.150 --> 39:53.320
You don't get to be happy
until I can get to my piano!

39:53.370 --> 39:55.620
Papa, I am so sorry.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.410
I really am. I-I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

39:58.450 --> 40:00.830
I didn't mean
to upset your lives.

40:00.870 --> 40:02.380
ABE:
Ugh.

40:02.420 --> 40:05.040
I've just missed him so much.

40:05.090 --> 40:07.380
I miss being married.

40:07.420 --> 40:11.220
I miss having someone
to laugh with,

40:11.260 --> 40:14.100
someone next to me at night.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.850
Are you sure?

40:18.890 --> 40:20.810
I love him.

40:20.850 --> 40:23.060
Goddamn it!

40:23.100 --> 40:27.280
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
I'm fine.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.570
Oy.

40:29.610 --> 40:32.820
And I thought your teenage years
were a problem.

40:32.860 --> 40:35.410
Well, look on the bright side.

40:35.450 --> 40:36.620
Still might not happen.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.660
Don't tease.

40:38.700 --> 40:43.750
I'm a different person now
than when he left.

40:43.790 --> 40:45.590
He might not like the new me.

40:45.630 --> 40:48.460
People change.

40:51.550 --> 40:55.090
You know who your mother
was when I first met her?

40:55.140 --> 40:58.810
She had just come back
from France.

40:58.850 --> 41:02.890
She smoked cigarettes.

41:02.940 --> 41:05.400
She wore a beret.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.980
-She ate.
-Stop.

41:08.020 --> 41:11.860
I once shared an entire
chocolate cake with her.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.860
That was a great night.

41:14.910 --> 41:20.200
But now... she's different.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.620
She changed.

41:21.660 --> 41:24.120
Ah, I'm sure I changed.

41:24.170 --> 41:28.090
I'm not as limber as I once was,
that's for sure.

41:28.130 --> 41:31.840
But I still love her.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.470
(sighs)
Change...

41:35.510 --> 41:37.600
part of marriage.

41:40.010 --> 41:41.020
If he loves you...

41:41.060 --> 41:42.350
He does.

41:42.390 --> 41:44.390
If he loves you,

41:44.440 --> 41:49.190
and you can forgive...

41:49.230 --> 41:52.070
ah, who the hell knows?

41:52.110 --> 41:54.240
Just, please...

41:54.280 --> 41:59.490
please, don't tell your mother
unless you're very, very sure.

41:59.530 --> 42:01.870
-Okay.
-Because if I come home

42:01.910 --> 42:06.120
and she's moved me
into the kids' room...

42:06.170 --> 42:08.750
-I'll have to kill you.
-I understand.

42:08.790 --> 42:12.800
I'll feel bad about it,
but it will happen.

42:19.350 --> 42:21.350
You need a hand?

42:21.390 --> 42:23.020
No.

42:23.060 --> 42:26.980
Not sure which way I want to go.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.610
If you need me, just holler.

42:29.650 --> 42:31.270
Mm-hmm.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.940
Yeah, definitely.

42:32.980 --> 42:35.150
Ha, this is it.

42:35.190 --> 42:37.530
Wow. This place ever new?

42:37.570 --> 42:39.240
Doubt it.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.620
(laughing):
Hey.

42:40.660 --> 42:42.160
Maybe I should take up
an instrument.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.910
We could have an act,
take it on the road.

42:43.950 --> 42:45.500
Wait, hear that?

42:45.540 --> 42:48.790
I think that was Imogene
passing out somewhere.

42:48.830 --> 42:51.000
Hey, I'm looking
for party albums.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.420
Uh, downstairs, but don't touch
anything without gloves on.

42:53.460 --> 42:55.300
Is that to protect
the records or me?

42:55.340 --> 42:56.420
(Archie chuckles)

42:56.470 --> 42:58.260
Oy, tough crowd.

42:58.300 --> 43:00.550
-Let's go downstairs.
-WOMAN: Play it again.

43:00.590 --> 43:03.010
-I swear I know her.
-MAN: Okay, here you go.

43:03.060 --> 43:04.560
MIDGE (on reel-to-reel
recorder): I gave him kids.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.480
-A boy and a girl.
-(laughs)

43:06.520 --> 43:08.190
And, yes, our little girl
is looking more and more

43:08.230 --> 43:10.100
like Winston Churchill
every day.

43:10.150 --> 43:11.770
-(both laugh) -You know,
with that big Yalta head?

43:11.810 --> 43:13.690
But that's not a reason
to leave, right?

43:13.730 --> 43:15.110
That's Barbra Mellon.

43:15.150 --> 43:17.110
No, it's not. I asked her.

43:17.150 --> 43:19.240
MIDGE:
Walk of shame.

43:19.280 --> 43:22.950
Walk of shame.

43:22.990 --> 43:26.120
I loved him and I showed him...

43:26.160 --> 43:27.790
WOMAN:
I love this part.

43:27.830 --> 43:29.040
MIDGE:
All that shit they say

43:29.080 --> 43:31.040
about Jewish girls
in the bedroom?

43:31.080 --> 43:33.290
Not true.
There are French whores

43:33.340 --> 43:35.130
standing around
the Marais District saying,

43:35.170 --> 43:37.720
(French accent): "Did you hear
what Midge did to..."

43:37.760 --> 43:39.010
What the hell is this?

43:39.050 --> 43:40.180
It's not for sale.

43:43.100 --> 43:45.680
(woman gasps)

43:45.720 --> 43:47.020
Hey.

43:52.650 --> 43:54.770
-Joel.
-Not now, Archie.

43:54.820 --> 43:56.280
What the hell was that?

43:56.320 --> 43:59.030
It's just... I just...

44:03.870 --> 44:06.990
Belter is located
just seven miles

44:07.040 --> 44:09.120
from the California Institute
of Technology,

44:09.160 --> 44:12.830
which gives us the opportunity
to recruit the expertise

44:12.880 --> 44:15.750
at CalTech to overhaul
its current production methods.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.590
My growing expertise

44:17.630 --> 44:20.420
in corporate
organizational structure,

44:20.470 --> 44:24.680
coupled with my newfound passion
for-for, uh...

44:36.110 --> 44:37.690
I quit.

44:41.030 --> 44:43.450
What?

44:50.700 --> 44:53.250
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Jesus Christ.

44:53.290 --> 44:54.750
-Hey, Lenny.
-It's you?

44:54.790 --> 44:56.840
I'm sorry. They wouldn't
let me in without paying.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.300
Yes, that's how
a business usually operates.

44:58.340 --> 44:59.880
Look, I had to talk to you.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.260
Don't you ever send a message
to anyone saying,

45:01.300 --> 45:02.590
"Your drug dealer is outside."

45:02.630 --> 45:04.180
That could go wrong
in so many ways.

45:04.220 --> 45:05.340
-Have you heard about this?
-What?

45:05.390 --> 45:06.430
Look.

45:08.470 --> 45:09.640
Sophie Lennon?

45:09.680 --> 45:10.890
Yes, yes, I heard.

45:10.930 --> 45:12.060
I rejoiced.

45:12.100 --> 45:13.140
Sophie Lennon's a hack.

45:13.190 --> 45:14.600
Plus, she owes me money.

45:14.650 --> 45:16.400
I wrote some jokes for her.
Never paid me.

45:16.440 --> 45:17.980
Good jokes, too,
but she said her audience

45:18.020 --> 45:19.280
doesn't know the word
"cunnilingus."

45:19.320 --> 45:20.610
Yeah, well,
because of that show,

45:20.650 --> 45:22.070
Amanda Gleason
has been blackballed.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.110
Who's Amanda Gleason?

45:23.150 --> 45:24.530
She's the comic
who took down Lennon.

45:24.570 --> 45:26.700
Amanda Gleason
is a terrible name.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.120
I know. She knows. We all know.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.200
The name's not the problem.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.080
-What's the problem?
-The problem is

45:31.120 --> 45:32.910
she's been blackballed.
She can't get a gig anywhere

45:32.960 --> 45:34.500
and I've been blackballed
along with her.

45:34.540 --> 45:35.500
You understand "blackballed"?

45:35.540 --> 45:36.710
I understand blackballed.

45:36.750 --> 45:38.130
-So...
-It's terrible.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.250
What do you want from me?

45:40.300 --> 45:42.510
I need you to do a show
at the Gaslight.

45:42.550 --> 45:44.590
I don't do basket houses
anymore.

45:44.630 --> 45:46.180
I wear big boy pants now.

45:46.220 --> 45:48.100
Just do this as a favor to me?

45:48.140 --> 45:50.260
For you?
I don't owe you anything.

45:50.310 --> 45:51.720
Now, if you really
were my dealer...

45:51.770 --> 45:53.350
Fine. Don't do it for me.

45:53.390 --> 45:54.350
Do it for Midge.

45:54.390 --> 45:55.640
-Midge?
-Yeah.

45:55.690 --> 45:58.560
Midge.

45:58.610 --> 46:00.230
Oh, Midge.

46:00.270 --> 46:02.690
Well, well, well.

46:02.740 --> 46:05.320
All hail the Upper West Side.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.570
So?

46:07.620 --> 46:10.870

47:05.130 --> 47:07.510
They're definitely not mine.
I don't think.

47:07.550 --> 47:09.470
Maybe they're the cousins
from Florida or...

47:09.510 --> 47:10.970
I have some family in Ottawa,
but...

47:11.010 --> 47:14.470
Holy shit, who the hell
are these people?

47:14.520 --> 47:15.720
MIDGE:
They're chorus boys.

47:15.770 --> 47:16.770
They're what?

47:16.810 --> 47:18.020
Chorus boys. Dancers.

47:18.060 --> 47:19.900
I... what?

47:19.940 --> 47:22.020
I wanted to make sure there were
great dancers at our wedding,

47:22.060 --> 47:24.400
so I hired some chorus boys from
Pajama Game to come and dance.

47:24.440 --> 47:26.030
Two of them did "Steam Heat."

47:26.070 --> 47:27.780
Notice the great hat work.

47:27.820 --> 47:30.820
I'm sorry. You hired ringers
to dance at our wedding?

47:30.860 --> 47:32.660
Yes.

47:32.700 --> 47:34.660
-Okay, come on.
-Wait, where are we going?

47:34.700 --> 47:35.870
To find the rabbi.

47:35.910 --> 47:37.870
I'm marrying you all over again.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.840
Ooh, that's good.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.170
Someone should
do something with that.

47:45.210 --> 47:47.340
Keep moving.

-But, you can't?
-Not right now.

Some other time would work.

49:32.780 --> 49:35.240
So, where are you going?

49:40.080 --> 49:41.910
You're not gonna tell me,
are you?

49:44.330 --> 49:46.630
Or, if you do,
you're just going to lie.

49:49.380 --> 49:53.340

isn't it?

No pressure, but I need you
to be perfect tonight.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.240
No pressure, but if ever
there was a night

50:56.280 --> 50:57.950
that everything in the world
depends on how great

50:57.990 --> 50:59.490

taking the pressure off.

-I thought I wasn't allowed
back here. -You're not.

I thought you weren't allowed
to give me stage time.

51:05.750 --> 51:07.580
-I'm not.
-Then what the hell is going...

51:07.620 --> 51:10.000
Jesus, you giving out free cars

Hello, Amanda Gleason.

What are you doing?
What is going on here?

51:14.960 --> 51:17.220
I am doing what is unheard of
in this business.

51:17.260 --> 51:18.470
It's called a very nice thing.

51:18.510 --> 51:19.840
Oh, well, then, thank you.

51:19.890 --> 51:21.300
Thank Susie.
She set this up.

51:21.350 --> 51:22.890
Are you going on like that?

51:22.930 --> 51:25.140
Thank you. What? No.

51:25.180 --> 51:26.520
Is there gonna be
a snowstorm in here?

51:26.560 --> 51:28.140
-No. -You keepin' it clean

Susie...

LENNY: She did.
She shoved a paper in my face...

51:44.660 --> 51:46.660
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

51:56.340 --> 51:57.670
Okay.

51:57.710 --> 52:00.090
So, I'm going up there
to do a set, for nothing.

52:00.130 --> 52:02.680
I'm going to say,
"Hello, blah, blah, blah,"

52:02.720 --> 52:04.720
and then I'm gonna
hand the mic off to you.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.180
The only thing I ask--
no, demand--

52:06.220 --> 52:08.680
I am not introducing you
as Amanda Gleason.

52:08.730 --> 52:11.020
-You've got to find a better
fucking name. -Way ahead of you.

52:11.060 --> 52:12.310
Okay. You ready?

52:12.350 --> 52:14.480
-I...
-Sure you are.

52:15.520 --> 52:17.030
How did you do this?

52:17.070 --> 52:18.900
Lots of perverted sex acts.

52:18.940 --> 52:20.700
I'll have skinned knees
for a month.

52:22.110 --> 52:23.950
Wow.

52:23.990 --> 52:25.620
Good look?

52:25.660 --> 52:26.990
(exhales sharply)
The look.

JACKIE:
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

52:28.410 --> 52:31.420
I can't believe these words
are coming out of my mouth,

52:31.460 --> 52:32.620
but here I go.

52:32.670 --> 52:36.300
Welcome to the stage,
Lenny Bruce!

52:36.340 --> 52:39.210
(loud cheering)

52:46.310 --> 52:47.720
LENNY:
Good evening,

52:47.760 --> 52:49.850
ladies, gentlemen,

52:49.890 --> 52:51.560
and all the undecided.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.730
(laughter)

52:52.770 --> 52:54.150
I'm your host for the evening.

52:54.190 --> 52:56.480
Now, I have promised
the powers that be

52:56.520 --> 52:59.230
that I will perform
my little dog and pony show

52:59.280 --> 53:01.280
for all you fine people, but,

53:01.320 --> 53:03.360
before I do,
I have a favor to ask.

53:03.410 --> 53:07.160
I have a friend who's been going
through some of the same shit

53:07.200 --> 53:08.790
that I've gone through lately,

53:08.830 --> 53:10.830
and I don't want to
get on a rant here,

53:10.870 --> 53:12.460
but Stalin would be very proud.

53:12.500 --> 53:14.370
(laughter)

53:14.420 --> 53:16.170
So, indulge me, because

53:16.210 --> 53:18.460
I think she's going to be
very big

53:18.500 --> 53:21.630
and she's a hell of a lot
easier on the eyes than I am.

53:21.670 --> 53:23.510
Please welcome to the stage,
a very classy lady,

53:23.550 --> 53:25.930
my friend...

53:25.970 --> 53:28.810
I'm actually gonna let her
introduce herself to you.

53:28.850 --> 53:30.430
Okay. Get up here.

53:30.470 --> 53:31.850
(applause)

53:31.890 --> 53:33.690
Susie...

53:33.730 --> 53:35.900
Go show 'em how it's done.

53:35.940 --> 53:39.110
MAN:
All right, yeah!

53:39.150 --> 53:41.570
Thank you. Hi!

53:41.610 --> 53:43.240
(louder, over microphone):
Thank you.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.990
Wow, so nice, considering
you thought you were here

53:45.030 --> 53:46.990
to see Lenny Bruce, and instead,
you have to listen to me

53:47.030 --> 53:49.030
-for a while.
-(laughter)

53:49.080 --> 53:52.450
I promise to insult the Pope
and read you my court documents

53:52.500 --> 53:54.870
-before the evening is over.
-(laughter)

53:54.920 --> 53:59.170
So, let's see,
what can I talk about?

53:59.210 --> 54:01.300
Going through a pretty dull time
in my life.

54:01.340 --> 54:05.510
Oh! My husband's girlfriend
attacked me at work yesterday.

54:05.550 --> 54:09.010
-(scattered laughter) -You know
what that's like, huh, ladies?

54:09.050 --> 54:11.520
Really? No one?

54:11.560 --> 54:13.680
Oh, good, then you'll love this.

54:13.730 --> 54:16.730
So, my husband left me
three months ago

54:16.770 --> 54:18.310
for his teenage secretary.

54:18.360 --> 54:21.150
However, the other night
he came home...

54:21.190 --> 54:22.990
for some clean underwear
and a fuck.

54:23.030 --> 54:24.780
(laughter)

54:24.820 --> 54:26.200
Actually,
just for the underwear.

54:26.240 --> 54:28.410
I threw in the fuck for free.

54:28.450 --> 54:32.160
Anyhow, Lolita found out
and, boy, was she steamed.

54:32.200 --> 54:35.120
She couldn't believe
I'd have the nerve

54:35.160 --> 54:37.500
to sleep with my husband.

54:37.540 --> 54:38.750
She thought that was mean.

54:38.790 --> 54:41.500
And vindictive.
And she has a point.

54:41.550 --> 54:44.590
After all, she has a teddy bear
he won for her at Coney Island.

54:44.630 --> 54:47.180
All I've got is a wedding ring

54:47.220 --> 54:48.930
and two kids
who called him "Daddy."

54:48.970 --> 54:52.010
Who cares if I was there first,
this girl

54:52.060 --> 54:54.390
put a lot of work
into luring him away.

54:54.430 --> 54:56.140
I mean, she had to...

54:56.180 --> 55:00.230
-have a vagina.
-(loud laughter)

55:00.270 --> 55:03.110
Pretty low bar.
But pretty high vagina.

55:03.150 --> 55:04.530
She's tall.

55:04.570 --> 55:07.360
-(laughter)
-And dumb. I mean, she's pretty,

55:07.400 --> 55:09.160
but I'm pretty sure
NASA doesn't have her

55:09.200 --> 55:10.950
on its short list
for job openings.

55:10.990 --> 55:14.200
Anyhow, yesterday she drags
her giant vagina into my work

55:14.240 --> 55:15.620
and starts yelling at me.

55:15.660 --> 55:17.960
And after a while,
I start yelling back.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.500
And she's saying,
"You stole him,"

55:19.540 --> 55:20.960
and I'm saying,
"I was there first."

55:21.000 --> 55:22.500
And she says,
"I was there second,"

55:22.540 --> 55:24.340
and I say, "That's a very
immature argument,"

55:24.380 --> 55:26.170
and she says, "Do you want to
buy some Girl Scout cookies?"

55:26.210 --> 55:27.670
And I say, "No,"
and she says, "You're sure?"

55:27.720 --> 55:29.130
And I say,
"Do you have vanilla creams?"

55:29.180 --> 55:31.140
And she says, "No,"
and I said, "You bitch!"

55:31.180 --> 55:33.640
(loud laughter, applause)

55:33.680 --> 55:35.390
And everyone in the store
is staring,

55:35.430 --> 55:38.440
and I'm starting to wonder,
who's right here?

55:38.480 --> 55:41.150
I mean, was it really fair
to lure Joel back

55:41.190 --> 55:42.900
with the promise of
coherent conversation

55:42.940 --> 55:44.780
and unlimited clean
jockey shorts?

55:44.820 --> 55:46.610
I just assumed I had that right.

55:46.650 --> 55:50.200
I really thought you find a guy,
you give it up, you get married.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.570
Oh, no, wait. You get married,
then you give it up.

55:52.620 --> 55:55.080
Get married, then give it up.
I got to write that down.

55:55.120 --> 55:58.460
Anyhow, my point is,
with the ring came the sex.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.170
Exclusive sex.

56:00.210 --> 56:02.210
Right? Something to count on.

56:02.250 --> 56:04.210
Something you know is yours.

56:04.250 --> 56:07.710
Like a social security number

56:07.760 --> 56:10.510
or a family history of insanity.

56:10.550 --> 56:11.590
(laughter)

56:11.640 --> 56:13.350
But apparently, it's not.

56:13.390 --> 56:15.350
He left. She took him.

56:15.390 --> 56:18.310
Did I relinquish my rights
when he walked out the door?

56:18.350 --> 56:19.850
Is that how it works?

56:19.890 --> 56:21.690
Now, did it always work that way

56:21.730 --> 56:23.610
and I just didn't read
the fine print?

56:23.650 --> 56:25.230
What are the fucking rules?

56:25.270 --> 56:28.320
I mean, not the fucking rules,
the "fucking" rules.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.280
Who gets first "fucking" rights?

56:30.320 --> 56:31.860
-(laughter)
-Hey.

56:31.910 --> 56:33.370
MIDGE:
Is it first come, first serve?

56:33.410 --> 56:35.200
-Finders keepers...
-Hey!

56:35.240 --> 56:36.830
-...losers eventually go blind?
-How did you get in

56:36.870 --> 56:39.660
-without paying?
-So, this is you, huh?

56:39.700 --> 56:41.960
-What?
-That!

56:42.000 --> 56:43.960
You got her into this, right?

56:44.000 --> 56:45.630
Got her to go up there
like that?

56:45.670 --> 56:48.550
Got her to stand up there
and talk about our life.

56:48.590 --> 56:50.590
-Hey, she says what she wants.
-Talk about me.

56:50.630 --> 56:52.130
She must just find you amusing.

56:52.180 --> 56:53.760
I know I find you
completely ridiculous.

56:53.800 --> 56:55.640
You don't give a shit
what you're doing.

56:55.680 --> 56:56.720
I'm not doing anything.

56:56.760 --> 56:59.060
You're breaking up a family!

56:59.100 --> 57:01.180
That's the mother
of my children up there

57:01.230 --> 57:03.850
talking trash about me in front
of a bunch of strangers.

57:03.900 --> 57:05.560
Well, you got to admit, it's
better than her talking trash

57:05.610 --> 57:07.360
about you in front of a bunch
of people you know.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.900
Are you happy?

57:08.940 --> 57:10.400
Are you happy
that you've ruined my life?

57:10.440 --> 57:12.700
Hey, I didn't fuck my secretary.
That was you!

57:12.740 --> 57:14.070
You don't know anything
about me.

57:14.110 --> 57:16.120
Oh, buddy, I know
so much more than you think.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.450
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

57:17.490 --> 57:20.450
You are ripped right out of
a bullshit male catalogue.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.750
King of the mansion,
spoiled brat.

57:22.790 --> 57:25.040
Who do you go home to, huh?

57:25.080 --> 57:26.710
What do you know
about having a family?

57:26.750 --> 57:28.590
Nothing! And thank God.

57:28.630 --> 57:31.170
'Cause if I had to go home to
you, I'd set the house on fire.

57:31.210 --> 57:33.380
-Fuck you!
-No, fuck you, Sal Mineo!

57:33.430 --> 57:34.970
Get the hell away from me.

57:35.010 --> 57:37.180
Midge has a path now, a career.

57:37.220 --> 57:39.640
And she's gonna be a star and
you are just gonna be that guy

57:39.680 --> 57:41.390
sitting at some loser bar
every night

57:41.430 --> 57:43.020
pointing to the television set
saying,

57:43.060 --> 57:45.310
"I used to be married to her,
but I fucking blew it!"

57:45.350 --> 57:47.020
MIDGE:
Wing it.

57:47.060 --> 57:49.440
And how come men seem to get
a completely different

57:49.480 --> 57:51.070
-set of rules to follow?
-MAN: Hey!

57:51.110 --> 57:53.990
Hey, go home
and clean the kitchen!

57:54.030 --> 57:55.780
MIDGE:
Oh, sir, I'm Jewish.

57:55.820 --> 57:58.620
-I pay people to do that.
-(laughter)

57:58.660 --> 58:00.290
Women aren't funny.

58:00.330 --> 58:02.160
Your wife must have
a sense of humor.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.580
She's seen you naked.

58:03.620 --> 58:06.330
-(loud laughter)
-(audience oohing)

58:06.370 --> 58:07.750
I'm sorry.
I thought we were truth telling.

58:07.790 --> 58:08.960
You're a dumb bitch.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.220
-Oh, who told you?
-(laughter)

58:15.720 --> 58:19.050
What can I say? All the good men
are taken, ladies.

58:19.100 --> 58:23.020
(applause)

58:23.060 --> 58:24.600
Now, where were we?

58:28.810 --> 58:30.650
MAN: Uptown or downtown, boys?
Where are we goin'?

58:30.690 --> 58:32.900
Hey, asshole!

58:32.940 --> 58:34.690
Oh, so you answer
to asshole, asshole?

58:34.740 --> 58:36.610
What's your problem?

58:38.910 --> 58:40.030
MAN 2:
Whoa, hey! Hey!

58:40.080 --> 58:41.950
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Get off!

58:41.990 --> 58:44.120
-Come on!
-What the hell are you doing?

58:44.160 --> 58:45.580
MAN 3: Hey, buddy,
you're gonna kill him.

58:45.620 --> 58:47.540
WOMAN:
Get out of here!

58:47.580 --> 58:49.960
(people shouting)

58:50.000 --> 58:53.260
-Are you crazy?!
-Come on.

58:53.300 --> 58:54.550
She's good!

58:54.590 --> 58:57.630
She's fucking good!

58:57.680 --> 58:59.220
Hey, get out of here!

58:59.260 --> 59:00.930
Keep walking.

59:00.970 --> 59:04.390
(excited chatter continues)

59:04.430 --> 59:07.140
She's good.

59:09.150 --> 59:10.860
She's good.

59:13.610 --> 59:15.940
(loud laughter)

59:15.990 --> 59:18.150
MIDGE: But if we didn't have
our husbands,

59:18.200 --> 59:20.700
-what would we have
to talk about? -(laughter)

59:20.740 --> 59:23.030
You have been a great audience,
ladies and gentlemen.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.370
That's it for me.

59:24.410 --> 59:26.200
My name is Mrs. Maisel.

59:26.250 --> 59:28.830
