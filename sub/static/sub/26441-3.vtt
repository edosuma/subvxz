That way is not for coloreds.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.312
for getting off, then back on there,

01:29.400 --> 01:32.472
not when there is folks standing
in the stairwell.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.917

So, not Sheffield then.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.594
I think he's in New York this week.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.790
I could give him a call.

What's that?

04:01.640 --> 04:03.120
Traces of Artron energy?

04:03.200 --> 04:04.680
Should we know what Artron energy is?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.956
It's the same type of energy
that TARDIS runs off.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.350
There really shouldn't be traces
of Artron energy here.

a segregated bus to a white passenger.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.794
And got arrested for it.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.576
How long have you been here?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.716
Get out of Montgomery.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.800
You're not the first to say that to us.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.359
If I see any of you again,
I will kill you.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.789
Don't threaten me.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.957
Chop chop, on your way now.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.356
(HUMMING)

13:46.440 --> 13:48.238
(LAUGHS) What are you doing?

13:48.320 --> 13:49.674
Come on, gang.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.274
Are we actually leaving?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.919
Not in a million years.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.432
I'm getting pretty sick
of seeing that sign.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.874
So, how are we gonna do this?

14:12.960 --> 14:13.960
(GROANS)

14:14.040 --> 14:15.679
In you come before anyone sees.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.360
Well, this is fun.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.110
Last time I sneaked into someone's room
by a window was Danny Biswas in Year 10.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.711
You just went right down
in my estimation.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.480
All right!

14:25.560 --> 14:28.029
Danny Biswas? He was punching
well above his weight.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.196
Did you just accidentally
pay me a compliment?

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Whatever.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.398
GRAHAM: Why can't we just
stay in the TARDIS?

14:36.480 --> 14:39.376
DOCTOR: Our friend with the temporal
displacement weapon has got eyes on it.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.681
We go in and out of there,
we're gonna run into him again.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.896
And I don't want to, just yet.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.840
- Not until we figure this out.
- This is better?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.798
Smuggling ourselves into crummy motels?

14:46.880 --> 14:48.792
I just need a moment to work this out.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.872
Yeah, like, what do we actually know?

14:50.960 --> 14:53.998
Well, 1955, Montgomery.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.198
One day away from Rosa Parks
refusing to give her seat up on a bus.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.431
Meanwhile, we've got
an out of time impostor,

14:59.520 --> 15:02.194
skulking in the bus works
with a temporal displacement weapon.

15:02.280 --> 15:06.194
I understand "weapon," but not sure
about "temporal displacement."

15:06.280 --> 15:08.112
Displaces you through time.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.396
A blast hits you,
you're thrown through time

15:10.480 --> 15:12.039
to wherever the user has set it.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.839
He had it set for the very far future.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.956
That's horrible.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.396
Yes, and it uses Artron molecules.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.393
That, plus his Vortex Manipulator

15:20.520 --> 15:23.638
were presumably what the TARDIS detected
when it brought us here.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.677
So, do we think he is trying
to kill Rosa Parks?

15:25.760 --> 15:26.800
Or use that weapon on her?

15:26.840 --> 15:29.594
He is been here a while.
Set up base at the bus works.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.160
If he wanted to get rid of her,
why has he not done it already?

15:32.520 --> 15:34.637
Besides, the sonic picked up
something else on him,

15:34.720 --> 15:36.234
but I need to go back to make sure.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.320
Right.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.120
What do you remember
about Rosa from school?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.754
Oi, whoa. What are you doing?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.640
That is vandalism.
We'll have to pay for that!

15:43.680 --> 15:45.160
Don't worry. Special pen.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.756
No, pack it in. You ain't Banksy.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
Or am I?

15:50.200 --> 15:54.240
Rosa takes the bus
on the first of December, 1955.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.640
What time of day?

15:55.720 --> 15:57.791
Evening. She was coming home from work.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.976
I remember because she said,
people thought she didn't stand

16:00.000 --> 16:01.736
because she was tired from working,
but she wasn't.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.760
Where did she work?

16:02.840 --> 16:05.150
I think it was in a shop,
like a department store.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.312
No, no, wait, earlier she told
that git that slapped Ryan,

16:08.440 --> 16:09.874
"Your suit will be ready tomorrow."

16:10.040 --> 16:12.794
That's it, she did clothes repairs.
She was a seamstress.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.031
I mean, is a seamstress.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.640
Can't get used to being in the past.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.279
(BANGING ON DOOR)

16:19.760 --> 16:21.433
- Bathroom.
- Seriously?

16:21.520 --> 16:22.920
Very seriously.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.117
No, Doc, the wall.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.440
(HUMMING)

16:31.520 --> 16:33.512
Banksy doesn't have one of those.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.796
Or have I?

16:37.640 --> 16:39.757
Oh, Officer. What can I do for you?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.434
Can I come in, ma'am?

16:43.160 --> 16:44.913
"Ma'am," I still can't get used to that.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.520
Here we are, darling.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.216
This police officer was
so keen to come in

16:49.240 --> 16:50.776
he didn't feel the need
to introduce himself.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.598
Is there a problem, Officer...

16:52.680 --> 16:55.149
Mason. Montgomery police.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.296
I'd offer you a cup but the refreshment
facilities are very poor.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.549
I'll be leaving a note.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.915
British?

17:02.080 --> 17:03.480
(CHUCKLES) How can you tell?

17:03.640 --> 17:05.632
You've been making folks uneasy.

17:05.760 --> 17:06.910
How have we done that?

17:07.040 --> 17:10.636
You don't happen to know
a couple of mongrels, hmm?

17:10.920 --> 17:13.674
Negro boy. Mexican girl.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.156
I don't recognise anyone
by that description.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.476
They say that Negro
has been going around

17:20.560 --> 17:24.076
picking fights with upstanding citizens.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.076
You appreciate it's a...
It's an offence

17:28.160 --> 17:30.391
to harbour coloreds in a room here.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.136
We're not harbouring anyone who
doesn't have the right to be here.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.160
Mmm-hmm.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.232
MASON: What's your business here
in Montgomery?

17:39.360 --> 17:42.080
We are here to pitch an invention.

17:42.360 --> 17:46.240
Yeah, uh, it's a telephone.

17:47.720 --> 17:53.717
That plays music and it's a camera,
also takes photos.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.633
And it's a calendar.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.992
And it sends letters.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.635
- Sounds ridiculous.
- Yeah...

18:01.120 --> 18:02.793
What's your name, sir?

18:03.160 --> 18:04.560
Steve.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.909
Jobs. Steve Jobs.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.560
You being disrespectful with me,
MrJobs?

18:11.640 --> 18:14.712
Steve Jobs would never disrespect
a Montgomery police officer, sir.

18:32.760 --> 18:37.516
You get yourselves gone
as soon as your business is concluded.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.199
Mmm-hmm.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.393
I did not warm to him.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.911
RYAN: I'm sick of this place already.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.560
YASMIN: I know.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.876
To be here just as history
is taking place.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.832
This ain't history here, Yaz.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.360
We're hiding behind bins.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
(SIGHS)

19:01.160 --> 19:04.312
I'm having to work so hard to keep
my temper, every second here.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.560
I could have slapped that guy back there
as soon as we arrived.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.830
Thank God, my nan taught me
how to keep my temper.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.791
Never give them the excuse.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.149
Yep.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.591
- My dad tells me the same.
- Yeah, see.

19:18.280 --> 19:22.320
It's not like Rosa Parks wipes out
racism from the world forever.

19:22.520 --> 19:26.514
Otherwise, how come I get stopped way
more by the police than my white mates?

19:27.360 --> 19:29.272
Oi, not this police.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.874
Tell me you don't get hassle.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.158
Of course, I do. Especially on the job.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.431
I get called a Paki
when I'm sorting out a domestic,

19:36.520 --> 19:39.194
or a terrorist on the way home
from the mosque.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.714
Yeah, exactly.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.437
But they don't win, those people.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.314
I can be a police officer now

19:45.400 --> 19:47.720
because people like Rosa Parks
fought those battles for me.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.995
For us.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.593
And in 53 years they'll have
a black president as leader.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.639
Who knows where they'll be
50 years after that?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.551
That's proper change.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.920

20:02.920 --> 20:05.958
- What?
- Were you born this positive?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.359
Guess so.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.033
Must be my Mexican blood.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240

20:13.520 --> 20:15.557
Yaz? Ryan?

20:17.120 --> 20:18.634
(HUMMING)

20:19.760 --> 20:23.151
Where were we? We need
as much intel as we can get.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.114
If we're gonna protect Rosa,
we need to know the facts of her life.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.159
Home address. Daily routine.
Where she works.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.875
The route she takes
and the church she attends.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.395
Also the name of the driver she refused.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.073
I know that. It's James Blake.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.475
How do you know that?

20:37.560 --> 20:41.110
Well, your nan when she found out
I was a bus driver, said to me,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.630
"You better not be like James Blake.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.598
"Blake the snake."
That's what she called him.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.637
And I had to ask her who he was,

20:47.720 --> 20:49.576
and she just said he gave
all bus drivers a bad name.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.273
She said that when you'd only just met?

20:51.360 --> 20:52.953
- Yeah.
- That's pretty hardline.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.440
That's my nan.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.632
Yeah. She had a t-shirt that said,

20:58.640 --> 21:00.120
"Spirit of Rosa."

21:02.680 --> 21:04.911
And well, I wish that she was here.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.832
I don't. She'd start a riot.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.798
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:13.880 --> 21:15.553
Right. Operation Rosa Parks.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.833
YASMIN: I found out where she works.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.957
Montgomery Fair Department store.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.437
And if the phone book's right,
this is where she lives.

21:41.560 --> 21:46.589
Right. So, these bus routes don't go
near Rosa's shop or house,

21:46.680 --> 21:49.354
but these ones do.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.837
Great. If we can find Rosa's route
and time today,

21:52.920 --> 21:54.320
we can keep an eye on her tomorrow.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.318
Who's up for a bus ride?

21:59.760 --> 22:01.433
GRAHAM. Sir, excuse me.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.749
Sorry.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.672
Hey, Doc.

22:06.120 --> 22:10.273
This route is one of three that goes
between Rosa's home and where she works.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.999
I reckon this one's the most direct.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.336
DOCTOR: So it's most likely she takes
this one tomorrow night.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.079
But we can't be certain
exactly what time.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.072
Unless we stalk her all day.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.636
This is me. On the back of the bus.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.115
I'm so ashamed.
You shouldn't have to do this.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.919
I agree. I'm sorry, Ryan.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.397
The driver let me on
at the front of the bus.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.836
What does that mean for where I sit?

22:35.880 --> 22:38.918
Obviously not a lot of
Pakistani heritage around here.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.599
Does coloured just mean black in 1955?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
(SIGHS)

22:44.240 --> 22:46.471
I guess I'll park
my South Asian Mexican backside

22:46.560 --> 22:48.756
in the white section
and let's see what happens.

Good times.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.990

23:10.080 --> 23:12.197
then get on the bus with her
when she finishes work.

Have a little chat.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.360
Hi. Nice to see you again.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.880
Mrs Parks, right?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.030
Yes.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.999
You helped us out earlier today
with our little misunderstanding.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.680
I remember. British.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.150
Yes, funny thing.
You'll never believe this.

23:32.360 --> 23:35.194
We're actually doing
market research for bus companies.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.078
Looking at people's transport habits.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.392
Answer the questions,
enter the raffle for a prize.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.870
You get this bus this time every day?

23:43.040 --> 23:45.635
Most days. Always this time.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.114
And you live?

23:47.200 --> 23:49.351
Cleveland Court. Next stop.

23:51.360 --> 23:56.640
Ma'am, if you keep sitting there
we're all going to have to move.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.120
What do you mean?

24:00.040 --> 24:03.158
Well, if white folks need seats,

24:03.520 --> 24:06.240
by law, I have to give mine up.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.597
This middle section's only for coloreds
if white folk don't need it.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.200
Well, that's not right.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.231
Tell that to your company, sir.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.197
If I win your raffle, will that give me

24:17.280 --> 24:21.274
the right to sit anywhere
I want on this bus?

24:22.080 --> 24:23.514
No.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.351
I didn't think so.

This is my stop.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.317
I'm gonna follow her.

24:34.440 --> 24:35.760
See what I can find out.

Meet you back at the motel later.

I hope so.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.559
Graham, do you think you can find
James Blake, the driver?

24:51.520 --> 24:53.840
Um, yeah, I'll just have a talk
with the bloke at the front

24:53.880 --> 24:55.758
and find out where
they all drink.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.560
Yaz, can you compile a timeline
of what happens,

24:58.640 --> 25:00.120
this time tomorrow evening?

25:00.200 --> 25:01.919
Okay. But what are you gonna do?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.993
Talk to our friend.
Tell him to stay out of history's way.

25:17.960 --> 25:21.590
Stalking Rosa Parks!
Don't know about this.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.672
You better not be following me.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.272
- I wanna help.
- With what?

25:32.560 --> 25:33.960
The fight.

25:35.440 --> 25:40.674
And how do I know you're not a spy
for the police or the FBI?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.720
Because if they were gonna send a spy

25:42.800 --> 25:45.616
they would send one who could actually
follow you without being spotted.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.313
And that didn't have a British accent.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.640
Also, don't think they know
any black guys.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.280
(LAUGHS)

25:56.440 --> 25:58.238
You any good at serving coffee?

Oops. Shame.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.840
You just sent all your equipment
to goodness knows where.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.630

26:47.720 --> 26:50.235

26:50.320 --> 26:51.470
(GRUNTS)

26:51.560 --> 26:53.597
Cheap and nasty. Now we're even.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.438
First things first.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.839
Tell me about Stormcage.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.519
- Storm what?
- Ah, rubbish liar.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.752
On your wrist is a Stormcage identifier.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.793
The most secure prison facility
this side of the universe.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.280
Not in this time zone, of course.

27:12.360 --> 27:15.034
But I guess that's where
the Vortex Manipulator comes in.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.600
It's amazing what you can get

27:16.680 --> 27:19.070
if you're prepared to work
and barter inside that prison.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.640
Escape or release?

27:20.720 --> 27:24.714
I did my time. I'm rehabilitated.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.871
What were you there for
in the first place?

27:26.960 --> 27:30.397
Oh, if I tell you,
it might colour your view of me.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.800
I was young. Nobody got hurt.

27:34.600 --> 27:39.834
Well, a few people got killed.
A few hundred people. Thousand tops.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.033
Two thousand.

27:45.840 --> 27:49.197
And it was nasty enough that Stormcage
placed a neural restrictor in your brain

27:49.280 --> 27:51.237
before releasing you
back into the universe.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.193
How can you know that?

27:56.160 --> 27:58.834
- Who are you?
- Very good scanner, this.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.832
I though I detected it
the first time we met.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.515
And then it started to make sense
because we were wondering...

28:03.600 --> 28:06.638
You've obviously got a problem
with Rosa, why don't you just kill her?

28:06.720 --> 28:08.996
But the answer is, because you can't.

28:09.520 --> 28:13.992
Neural restrictor means you can't kill
or injure any living thing.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.993
It stops you from doing it,
no matter how much you wanna try.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.753

smash your Vortex Manipulator...

28:47.720 --> 28:50.633
- Why?
- I'm allowed a hobby.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.079
And yours is Rosa Parks?

28:53.160 --> 28:55.072
This is where things
started to go wrong.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.953
And you think you can put them right?

29:00.120 --> 29:02.680
I had a lot of time to think
in Stormcage,

29:02.760 --> 29:06.310
and I realised
tiny actions change the world.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.240
What's your name?

29:09.320 --> 29:12.233
- Krasko.
- Don't like it.

29:12.360 --> 29:15.000
Listen, Krasko,
I will give you one warning.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.720
Go somewhere else.
Find a beach, read a book.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.190
Because you're a criminal
who's lost his kit.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.634
Lost his weapons.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.480
You think that makes a difference?

29:25.280 --> 29:29.274
History changes
when tiny things don't go to plan.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.272
You mean tomorrow.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.272
Won't work.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.317
Not while I'm here.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.280
Well, let's see.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.954
This is Ryan Sinclair.
He's from England.

29:54.200 --> 29:58.956
I'm thinking he might be
a new recruit to our youth council.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.080
I said he could listen in
and serve coffee.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.233
Ah, this is my husband, Parks.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.317
This is Mr Fred Gray.

30:12.200 --> 30:16.911
And this is Dr King
from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

30:17.640 --> 30:18.710
What?

30:18.800 --> 30:21.474
- Martin Luther King?
- That's correct.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.075
Oh, my days.
My nan loves you.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.719
Your "nan"?

30:28.280 --> 30:30.397
My gran. Grandma.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.234
The elder ladies do love
your sermons, Martin.

30:33.920 --> 30:37.231
You'll never be short for
a grey-haired wife in Alabama.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.993
She attend Dexter Avenue?

30:40.000 --> 30:42.276
No, she died recently.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.076
I'm sorry for your loss, son.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.793
Thank you.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.678
Thank you, Martin Luther King.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.472
She'd be chuffed to know
that you said that.

- Ryan.
- Excuse me, Dr King.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.992
Yes, Rosa Parks? Whoa.

keeping coloreds apart from whites.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.918
No. No, we don't do that.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.309
You approve of that, Jim?

31:33.400 --> 31:35.960
Just the way it is.
No matter how much they complain.

31:36.040 --> 31:37.474
Ain't going to change.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.872

Well, 'cause it's a Thursday, innit?
You know, like a work day.

gave me the good news.

But, yeah.

Meeting you guys. Listening to you
all talk. I can't believe it.

It'll get better, you know.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.633
Better.

That's what I said.
Strangely, he didn't listen.

Tiny actions.
That's what Krasko is doing.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.914
See, he's clever. I'll give him that.
He knows.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.074
He is not planning on killing
or destroying or breaking history.

33:27.160 --> 33:31.791
He's planning to nudge it
just enough so that it doesn't happen.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.714
Enough of a stick in the spokes
to throw everything off the rails

33:34.800 --> 33:36.496
and now I'm really mixing
my transport metaphors.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.080
Well, he didn't reckon
with us keeping it in place.

33:43.320 --> 33:46.279
Now we know what our task is.

Keep history in order.

No changing it.

Rosa Parks gets on the bus

33:59.000 --> 34:02.630
driven byJames Blake
and that the bus is full,

34:02.720 --> 34:05.440
so Rosa sits when she is asked
to stand for white passengers.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.896
- (BEEP)
- Ryan, don't mess with that.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.320
How does it even work?

Charger's here, this setting dials
the temporal destination.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.480
Pretty simple, pretty deadly.

34:13.560 --> 34:14.880
Now, can we concentrate?

34:14.960 --> 34:17.235
How are we supposed
to keep history in order

34:17.320 --> 34:19.596
if James Blake is going
to go fishing at Mill Creek

34:19.679 --> 34:21.797
and another driver is lined up
to do his route?

- I've got an idea.
- I've got an idea.

I reckon we'll be here all day.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.235
Yeah, might as well.

is kicking off.

- Mmm.
- Gonna be big trouble.

Oh, we heard that
a group of black passengers

36:10.240 --> 36:12.480
were planning a sit-in across
all the bus routes tonight.

Don't do that.

enormous clothing emergency.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Can you help me?

36:39.080 --> 36:41.640
That is one nasty tear.

36:41.720 --> 36:42.949
Yes, it is.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.239
And there is nothing us Brits hate
more than a clothing emergency.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.880
Mrs Parks, I have to go out
in that coat this evening,

36:48.960 --> 36:50.679
and if it's torn
I'll get in such trouble.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.240
Can you take a look at it now?

Well, I don't have any collections
until tomorrow afternoon.

I guess I could fit you in.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.235
Now, if you come back
just before we close...

37:09.320 --> 37:12.313
I'll wait... while you work.
Keep you company.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.239
- I don't need company.
- No, but my coat does.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.955
It's very valuable.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.032
I don't usually allow it
out of my sight.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.874
Thank you.
You're gonna make a big difference.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.120
Well, I best set to work then.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.216
Don't let her out of your sight.
I'm gonna go meet Graham and Ryan.

37:29.240 --> 37:33.234
Remember, get Rosa out of here
by 5:40, at the latest,

37:33.320 --> 37:34.959
to be on that bus on time.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.159
(TICKING)

37:42.240 --> 37:44.118
BLAKE: I came back
from the creek for this?

37:44.200 --> 37:46.271
Four flat tyres
and a smashed in windshield.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.840
What the hell happened?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.154
- Kids.
- Well, I can't drive that.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.153
Oh, no, you go on home.
We'll cancel the route.

37:57.480 --> 38:01.315
BLAKE: So much for that protest.
This bus ain't going nowhere.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.040
GRAHAM: Did you hear that?

38:06.120 --> 38:07.839
Everything we do,
Krasko's a step ahead.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.230
He must have deliberately smashed up
that bus himself.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.440
RYAN: We've got to fix this.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.796
James Blake has got to drive
Rosa's bus home tonight.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.678
(PANTING)

38:15.800 --> 38:17.678
Right, well,
he ain't giving up that easily.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.080
Well, neither are we.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.914
Ryan, check every bus stop
along Blake's route.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.072
Tell the waiting passengers that the
bus is coming, and they have to wait.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.196
Okay.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.199
Do not let any of the passengers walk.
The bus has to be full.

38:29.280 --> 38:32.273
It has to be crowded enough
so that Rosa is expected to move.

38:32.360 --> 38:34.272
Right, got it. Good luck.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.431
- Now, Graham.
- Mmm-hmm?

38:37.920 --> 38:39.513
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

38:40.640 --> 38:43.917
GRAHAM: Nicking and hot-wiring a bus
from right outside the depot?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.515
Hope our friendly cop
don't hear about this.

38:46.600 --> 38:47.875
What in the hell?

38:50.360 --> 38:51.840
This is your replacement bus service.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.957
- Jim boy.
- You again.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.816
I know, I literally get everywhere.
Now, come on. Hop in and do your job.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.513
You're already 18 minutes
behind schedule.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.553
How do you know that? What's going on?
What happened to that damn sit-in?

39:01.640 --> 39:03.074
Nobody else knew anything about it.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.153
Love to explain all that to you
but you know us Brits. Very imperious.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.993
Not prone on explaining ourselves
to anyone.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.753
So no time to chat. Just get driving.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.640
Lot of people need
to get on this bus tonight.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.878
(SIGHS) Driver James Blake
behind the wheel, check.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.520
"Bus services suspended."
No, no, no. Krasko.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.392
Have you always
wanted to be a seamstress?

39:46.480 --> 39:49.279
No, I dreamed of being a teacher.

39:49.360 --> 39:53.240
But my grandmother got sick,
then my mother,

39:53.360 --> 39:56.239
- so that was the end of school.
- Sorry about that.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.392
Oh, I got myself educated.
Just took longer than I thought.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.913
- But you kept going.
- Always.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.356
An education makes you unstoppable.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.112
Everything here is a fight for you.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.840
Don't you get tired?
What keeps you going?

40:11.120 --> 40:13.191
The promise of tomorrow.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.796
When today isn't working,
tomorrow is what you have.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.271
You married? Got a job back home?

40:20.360 --> 40:22.829
Not married and I'm a police officer.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.599
- You're police?
- Yup. Just starting.

40:26.680 --> 40:27.796
Not where I want to be.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.038
- Mmm. Where is it you want to be?
- In charge.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.713
(LAUGHS) Amen to that.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.479
Shouldn't you be finishing up?

40:36.600 --> 40:40.276
If a job is worth doing,
it is worth doing well.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.319
But don't you have a bus to get?

40:42.400 --> 40:44.119
I can always walk.

41:02.840 --> 41:06.038
Hey, Doc, I don't want to be an alarmist

41:06.120 --> 41:08.351
but this bus seems a bit emptier
than last night.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.560
(SIGHS)

41:11.040 --> 41:12.918
DOCTOR: No, that's bad.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.477
We need the bus to be full.
Come on, Ryan.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.520
Excuse me, excuse me. Old people.
The buses are still running.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.159
We're gonna walk.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.914
The buses are coming, I promise.
Please, just wait for the bus.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.992
You don't tell me what to do, boy.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.160
Oh, man. This place.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.159
Passengers down, white passengers down.
Not good.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.716
- I think that should just about...
- Love it.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.479
Let's go. I'll walk you out.
Pay you on the way.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.632
Ah, I might have known.
Pretty boy blocking the road.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.632
Right then. This is on me.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.398
Mate, move your car so the bus
gets through. Come on, out of the way.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.597
No, you get out of my way.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.912
Just give it up, will you?
Cut your losses.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.229
You're not gonna win tonight.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.313
I already have.
I know what should happen.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.715
And even if it gets past here,

42:16.800 --> 42:20.396
that bus is at least three passengers
short of what it should be by now.

42:20.480 --> 42:23.951
Parks won't be asked to stand,
she won't protest

42:24.040 --> 42:26.236
and your kind
won't get above themselves.

42:26.320 --> 42:29.870
- My "kind"?
- Yeah, your kind.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.995
Stay in your place.

42:32.720 --> 42:35.030
Mate, you're living in the past.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.396
In fact, you like the past that much,

42:37.480 --> 42:39.915
- so why don't you stay there?
- (BEEP)

42:41.600 --> 42:43.990
Oh! Oh, it worked.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.157
Nice one, Ryan. Thanks, Ryan.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.156
Move the car, clear the route,
find the bus,

42:49.240 --> 42:52.756
and Rosa Parks will change the world.
Good, here we go.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.271
DOCTOR: Yaz!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how's it going?

43:00.360 --> 43:02.033
Mrs Parks fixed your coat.

43:02.120 --> 43:06.114
Oh, thank you, Mrs Parks.
Beautiful work. Much appreciated.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.873
You're welcome, ma'am.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.798
RYAN: Don't shut the door.
Don't drive off! One more coming on.

43:18.280 --> 43:22.069
(PANTING) Found you.
I just got rid of Krasko.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.436
- How?
- I borrowed this.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.160
I think I dialled the settings
as far back as it can go.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.350
He's gone.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.397
Use the door for coloreds.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.999
Law's a law.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.554
DOCTOR: Let's move back.

43:57.440 --> 44:01.070
GRAHAM: Hey, Doc, Rosa's on board,
Blake's driving, we're good, right?

44:02.280 --> 44:04.112
YASMIN: What's the matter?
What are you doing?

44:04.200 --> 44:05.429
Counting seats.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.712
YASMIN: Has it worked?
Have we done enough?

44:08.800 --> 44:10.120
I don't know.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.954
We get off at the next stop, right?

44:15.320 --> 44:17.437
Empire Theatre, yeah.

44:20.440 --> 44:24.195
Right, come on then. We can go.
Job done. History is safe.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.632
- Well, come on then.
- Doctor?

44:30.720 --> 44:32.393
Don't get off, Graham.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.796
If we get off, there's enough
empty seats for white passengers.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.634
Rosa won't be asked to move.
We have to stay on.

44:39.720 --> 44:43.157
We were here. We're part of the story.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.833
Part of history.

44:44.920 --> 44:46.752
No, no. I don't want to be part of this.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.799
We have to. I'm sorry.
We have to not help her.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.757
I'm gonna need those seats back there.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.599
You all better make it light on
yourselves and let me have those seats.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.234
Stand up now.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.557
I don't think I should have to.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.710
(SHOUTING) Are you going to stand up?

46:01.400 --> 46:02.720
No.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.479
If you don't stand,
I'm gonna have you arrested.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.754
You may do that.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.914
Across Montgomery
people refuse to use the buses

47:39.000 --> 47:40.992
as a response to Rosa's arrest.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.552
And in just over a year,
on the 21st of December, 1956,

47:46.640 --> 47:49.712
segregation on buses in Montgomery
was ended.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.480
So it all worked out for her.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.517
No, life's still hard for Rosa.

47:54.280 --> 47:56.351
She loses her job, so does her husband.

47:56.440 --> 47:59.717
It's a struggle. They keep fighting.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.519
And in June 1999,

48:03.640 --> 48:07.190
Rosa receives the Congressional Medal
from President Clinton.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.670
The highest award given to any civilian,

48:09.760 --> 48:13.754
recognising her as a living icon
for freedom.

48:14.320 --> 48:17.392
It took so long, though. Her whole life.

48:17.480 --> 48:18.880
Yes, it did.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.472
But she changed the world.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.792
In fact, she changed the universe.
