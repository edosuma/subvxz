<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

00:02.291 --> 00:05.058
I'm Dr. AJ Austin in the flesh.

00:05.094 --> 00:06.927
<i>One of the most gifted
cardiothoracic surgeons</i>

00:06.963 --> 00:08.328
<i>is meeting with me today.</i>

00:08.364 --> 00:09.763
I still plan to cut.

00:09.799 --> 00:11.331
Why bother?

00:11.367 --> 00:12.967
Keep Austin away
from conscious patients.

00:13.003 --> 00:14.802
York, what did you shove
up your rectum this time?

00:14.838 --> 00:16.068
<i>It was the first time that...</i>

00:16.105 --> 00:17.938
That you had extracted

00:17.974 --> 00:21.441
an object from the colon
of an adult male?

00:21.477 --> 00:24.078
- Yes.
- <i>I like working for Hunter.</i>

00:24.114 --> 00:26.779
She likes everyone who works
for her to be discreet.

00:26.815 --> 00:28.448
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

00:28.484 --> 00:29.984
<i>I'm just delivering
your groceries.</i>

00:30.020 --> 00:32.152
<i>I think someone's following me.</i>

00:32.188 --> 00:34.357
I'm just starting to realize
how far Lane's willing to go.

Claudia!

01:06.722 --> 01:08.258
Claudia, wait!
Somebody, he... Get her!

01:12.662 --> 01:14.460
Seriously? Are you...

01:14.496 --> 01:16.166
Really? Thanks.

01:24.573 --> 01:26.307
- And then he said...
- "No,

01:26.343 --> 01:27.641
Bob's actually your uncle."

01:30.680 --> 01:31.644
See,
that's funny because it's...

01:32.681 --> 01:34.582
Never mind.

01:35.719 --> 01:37.850
"Incoming"?

01:37.886 --> 01:39.752
Whoa!

01:39.788 --> 01:41.192
Oh!

01:42.525 --> 01:44.091
Claudia?

01:44.127 --> 01:45.358
- Get back! Get back!
- Hey! Hey!

01:45.394 --> 01:46.760
- Stop. Claudia.
- Claudia.

01:48.597 --> 01:50.263
- Get back! Get back.
- Claudia, let us help you.

01:50.299 --> 01:52.365
- Hey.
- You're hallucinating.

01:56.706 --> 01:57.938
No! Please!

01:59.075 --> 02:00.274
Oh, my God.

02:02.911 --> 02:04.210
Just come with us.

02:04.246 --> 02:05.912
Claudia!

Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:18.494 --> 02:20.226
- Incoming.
- Okay, let's go to Trauma One.

02:20.262 --> 02:23.066
Major trauma, page Surgery.

02:27.837 --> 02:29.737
It's your sis.
Do you want me to pick up?

02:29.773 --> 02:32.305
I can't do Jessie before coffee.

02:32.341 --> 02:34.308
Well...

02:34.344 --> 02:36.614
I got his license plate.

02:38.648 --> 02:40.284
And you were gonna
keep that to yourself?

02:42.452 --> 02:44.250
- What?
- And do what?

02:44.286 --> 02:46.654
Track him down, catch up to him
this time, kick his ass?

02:46.690 --> 02:49.422
Oh, well, maybe you can track
him down and slash his tires,

02:49.458 --> 02:51.659
throw a trash can
through his window.

02:51.695 --> 02:52.959
Whatever.

02:52.995 --> 02:54.595
How about I call the cops?

02:54.631 --> 02:56.429
They can finally nail
this creepy son of a bitch.

02:56.465 --> 02:58.464
Yeah, that sounds
like a good plan.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.734
Think this is
when you go help someone

03:01.770 --> 03:04.405
in that big, shiny hospital.

03:04.441 --> 03:06.006
I'm fine.

03:21.357 --> 03:22.956
She was hit by an ambulance?

03:22.992 --> 03:24.357
Yeah, she was admitted

03:24.393 --> 03:26.260
with a severe headache,
high temperature,

03:26.296 --> 03:28.529
nausea, somnolence,
and she started hallucinating

03:28.565 --> 03:30.763
- and she charged out.
- Yeah. Hip fracture

03:30.799 --> 03:32.965
from impact
with the ambulance, and...

03:33.001 --> 03:35.202
looks like loops of bowel
in her chest?

03:35.238 --> 03:36.670
The impact ruptured
her diaphragm.

03:36.706 --> 03:38.304
I'll prep for surgery.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.107
Yeah, I'd like to pull in
Dr. Austin for this,

03:40.143 --> 03:41.809
if you could check his schedule?

03:41.845 --> 03:43.944
He treated you like a child
at Bradley's surgery.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.145
He's the best thoracic surgeon
I've ever seen.

03:46.181 --> 03:49.482
He'll probably save her life.

03:52.388 --> 03:54.454
Dr. Nolan,

03:54.490 --> 03:55.722
I called you a cretin

03:55.758 --> 03:57.524
after our last
surgical experience.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.692
Is there anything
you'd like to say to me?

03:59.728 --> 04:01.832
Yes, there is.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.568
Let's have a good surgery.

04:06.101 --> 04:08.202
I love that.

04:08.238 --> 04:10.002
Yes, let's do that.

04:10.038 --> 04:12.875
Dr. Okafor, proceed with
the time out, s'il vous plaÃ®t.

04:14.043 --> 04:15.709
Claudia Clare Webb.

04:15.745 --> 04:17.644
Yes, correct.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.079
A pair of ruptured
diaphragms, status: post-MVA,

04:20.115 --> 04:21.382
versus pedestrian...

04:21.418 --> 04:23.716
Well, this is a special treat.

04:23.752 --> 04:25.486
Just here to observe.

04:25.522 --> 04:28.392
Dr. Bell said,
"I will still cut."

04:30.026 --> 04:32.091
I said, "Why bother?"

04:32.127 --> 04:33.360
Dr. Bell said,

04:33.396 --> 04:36.663
"Love, passion, discipline."

04:36.699 --> 04:40.603
A rare opportunity
for the both of us.

04:44.274 --> 04:46.272
- And after that, we can take you to see her...
- Damn it, lady!

04:46.308 --> 04:47.274
You keep giving me
the runaround.

04:47.310 --> 04:48.509
I need you to tell me...

04:48.545 --> 04:50.043
Sir, you need to calm down.

04:50.079 --> 04:51.411
I need you to tell me
where I can find Claudia.

04:51.447 --> 04:54.680
- Now. My...
- Hey. Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

04:54.716 --> 04:56.616
- Claudia's my patient. What's your name?
- Felix.

04:56.652 --> 04:58.284
- Are you taking me to see her?
- Soon.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.685
Trust me, she's in good hands.

04:59.721 --> 05:00.788
I trust nobody.

05:00.824 --> 05:02.255
Nobody.

05:02.291 --> 05:03.923
Now, somebody, tell me
where I can see Claudia,

05:03.959 --> 05:06.360
or get out of my face now.

05:06.396 --> 05:07.693
I'll take you to see her as soon

05:07.729 --> 05:09.630
- as she's in recovery.
- I don't believe you.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.397
I got to make sure
that Claudia's getting

05:11.433 --> 05:13.233
the best treatment.
People like you

05:13.269 --> 05:15.635
lie to people like me
all the time.

05:15.671 --> 05:18.639
I need to see Claudia now!

05:18.675 --> 05:20.940
Are you done? Are you ready
to listen to the person

05:20.976 --> 05:23.075
who's trying to save her life?

05:23.111 --> 05:25.077
Hmm?

05:31.421 --> 05:33.719
So, Claudia's your mom?

05:33.755 --> 05:37.490
She's more of a mother to me
than anyone else.

05:37.526 --> 05:40.260
She gave me a job
when no one else would.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.163
We have to run some tests
when she's out of surgery

05:43.199 --> 05:44.330
and figure out what's going on.

05:44.366 --> 05:46.834
Yeah, I know, I know, but...

05:46.870 --> 05:48.469
She spreads herself thin,
you know?

05:48.505 --> 05:52.005
She's got a lot
of mouths to feed.

05:56.812 --> 05:58.846
Looks like
a traumatic splenic laceration

05:58.882 --> 06:00.247
from the accident.

06:00.283 --> 06:01.615
Do you need
a trauma surgeon or...?

06:01.651 --> 06:03.987
No. Lap. Suction.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.452
Hmm.

06:06.488 --> 06:08.921
"Not seeing things
can be a blessing."

06:08.957 --> 06:10.791
Someone famous said that.

06:10.827 --> 06:12.291
August Strindberg.

06:12.327 --> 06:15.462
Ah, look at
the big brain on Albert.

06:15.498 --> 06:18.764
But that quote doesn't
really apply in surgery.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.466
Seeing is saving.

06:20.502 --> 06:23.005
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Bell?

06:26.509 --> 06:28.078
Dr. Bell?

06:30.312 --> 06:33.113
Well, I've never met
a bleeder I couldn't catch.

06:33.149 --> 06:36.315
All right, Captain,
I think it's my turn.

06:36.351 --> 06:38.485
Stay where you are,
keep your quotes to yourself.

06:38.521 --> 06:40.521
2-0 silk.

07:01.110 --> 07:02.676
Imagine you can handle it
from here.

07:06.214 --> 07:08.514
Nice.

07:08.550 --> 07:11.517
Yes, Officer,
the guy has been following me,

07:11.553 --> 07:13.719
he confronted me at my house.

07:13.755 --> 07:16.723
I just... I don't feel safe.

07:16.759 --> 07:21.260
Okay. You'll look into it when?

07:21.296 --> 07:22.896
Thanks.

07:22.932 --> 07:24.897
For nothing.

07:29.238 --> 07:31.904
- Allie, listen.
- What are you doing here?

07:31.940 --> 07:34.507
Look, I'm worried Lane's
gonna hurt someone else.

07:34.543 --> 07:37.077
I just need Lily's
original blood work.

07:37.113 --> 07:38.712
- I know you're scared...
- Uh, yes.

07:38.748 --> 07:39.913
I'm scared.

07:39.949 --> 07:41.949
I have a child, bills.

07:41.985 --> 07:43.550
If I lose this job...

07:43.586 --> 07:45.685
I can't lose this job.

07:45.721 --> 07:48.224
Stay away from me.

07:51.594 --> 07:53.594
All right,
the surgery went well.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.262
- Toxicology results?
- Negative.

07:55.298 --> 07:57.130
- No drugs, no alcohol.
- Well, we still have to figure out

07:57.166 --> 07:58.464
what's causing
her erratic behavior.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.565
Sounds like bacterial
meningitis.

07:59.601 --> 08:00.967
She needs a spinal tap.

08:01.003 --> 08:03.103
Start her on empiric
antibiotics after that.

08:03.139 --> 08:04.704
Ah, Pravesh.

08:04.740 --> 08:07.640
Your favorite frequent flyer
just arrived.

08:07.676 --> 08:08.976
Go.

08:09.012 --> 08:10.978
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

08:11.014 --> 08:14.685
Don't tell me he put
another condiment in his colon!

08:16.319 --> 08:19.285
It's nice
to see you again, York.

08:19.321 --> 08:22.389
- And this must be...
- My beloved mother, Yvonne.

08:22.425 --> 08:25.225
Yorkie has told me
so much about Chastain.

08:25.261 --> 08:27.093
Thank you for your care of him.

08:27.129 --> 08:28.662
Don't mention it.

08:28.698 --> 08:32.332
I have the same problem,
you know.

08:32.368 --> 08:34.799
A day without asthma
is a day I long for.

08:34.836 --> 08:36.769
Well,

08:36.804 --> 08:38.438
we are so glad that we could help.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.240
With his asthma.

08:40.275 --> 08:41.808
And Conrad is where?

08:41.844 --> 08:43.808
Urgent case.

08:43.845 --> 08:46.112
So, Ms. Evans,
what brings you in today?

08:46.148 --> 08:47.681
Well, I took a tumble.

08:47.717 --> 08:50.917
Yorkie and I were out for a walk
on the BeltLine, and...

08:50.953 --> 08:52.318
Can we stop for a second?

08:52.354 --> 08:53.620
Do you have
any heart-related issues?

08:53.656 --> 08:57.256
Mm, no, not that I know of.

08:57.292 --> 08:58.625
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Yeah.

08:58.661 --> 08:59.960
- Okay.
- It hurts, yeah.

08:59.996 --> 09:02.129
I'm gonna order
an echocardiogram and expedite

09:02.165 --> 09:03.462
an X-ray on your foot, okay?

09:03.498 --> 09:05.432
- Fine by me.
- All right.

09:05.468 --> 09:07.471
Wait.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.871
- Wait, where you going?
- Just one sec.

09:11.907 --> 09:14.975
My mother is my entire life.
Do you understand?

09:15.011 --> 09:17.376
She seems
like a very sweet lady, York.

09:17.412 --> 09:19.479
She is a bulldog.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.481
My dad left us.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.350
Did she wallow in self-pity? No.

09:23.386 --> 09:25.818
She grabbed life by the balls.

09:25.854 --> 09:27.453
Kung fu grip,

09:27.489 --> 09:28.789
- started squeezing...
- Okay.

09:28.825 --> 09:31.792
Just try not to worry, York.

09:31.828 --> 09:34.327
I assure you, she is going
to get the very best care.

09:34.363 --> 09:35.998
She better.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.876
Jessie?

10:23.912 --> 10:25.378
- I screwed up, Nicky.
- Look at me, what did you take?

10:25.414 --> 10:28.247
I tried to call you,
I tried to call you.

10:28.283 --> 10:29.348
Oxy?

10:29.384 --> 10:31.351
- Yeah. I'm...
- Okay.

10:31.387 --> 10:33.620
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on, okay?

10:33.656 --> 10:34.721
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

10:34.757 --> 10:36.689
Oxy overdose, 79 Fairview Drive.

10:36.725 --> 10:37.857
I have Narcan.

10:37.893 --> 10:40.129
I'm giving it to her now.

10:41.664 --> 10:42.962
Stay with me, Jessie.

10:45.066 --> 10:47.137
Come here.

10:48.003 --> 10:49.973
Stay with me, Jessie.

10:54.509 --> 10:56.710
Come on.

10:56.746 --> 10:58.712
Come on, come on, come on.

10:58.748 --> 11:00.675
Come on, come on.

11:03.290 --> 11:06.119
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never
want to do this to you again.

11:06.155 --> 11:08.154
I don't care. I don't care
about that, Jess, okay?

11:08.190 --> 11:10.823
- Let's just get you better.
- Trauma Bay Two.

11:10.859 --> 11:13.793
- What's going on?
- My sister. She OD'd on oxy.

11:13.829 --> 11:15.828
- I gave her two doses of Narcan.
- You had it around?

11:15.864 --> 11:17.931
After the last time, I had to.
Just keep an eye on her, okay?

11:17.967 --> 11:19.466
You know I will.

11:19.502 --> 11:21.768
Vitals, full blood work, EKG.
Let's have Narcan standing by.

11:21.804 --> 11:24.069
I want updates every five
minutes. Keep this one quiet.

11:24.105 --> 11:25.471
Of course.

11:25.507 --> 11:28.909
I told her to call me
before she...

11:28.945 --> 11:30.943
I didn't pick up earlier.
I should have answered.

11:30.979 --> 11:33.612
She's here now. She's safe.

11:33.648 --> 11:36.448
- She could have died.
- Do not do this to yourself.

11:36.484 --> 11:38.555
I should've picked up
the phone. I...

11:43.993 --> 11:45.591
Any word on Claudia's
blood test?

11:45.627 --> 11:47.260
Elevated white count,
otherwise normal.

11:47.296 --> 11:49.295
We'll need more tests
to figure out what's going on.

11:49.331 --> 11:51.431
My head's killing me!

11:51.467 --> 11:54.701
- My head is killing me!
- Look at me. Deep breaths.

11:54.737 --> 11:56.135
Deep breaths, Claudia. Claudia.

11:56.171 --> 11:57.870
Tell me what's wrong
with me, please.

11:57.906 --> 12:01.006
- Stay focused. Shh...
- What's going on? What do we got?

12:01.042 --> 12:02.274
Her head CT was normal,

12:02.310 --> 12:04.211
but with these symptoms,
I think we need a repeat.

12:04.247 --> 12:05.712
Claudia.

12:05.748 --> 12:08.215
We're gonna get you something for the pain.

12:08.251 --> 12:11.050
Claudia's visitor, Felix,
in a gang.

12:11.086 --> 12:12.885
Last time one of their
members showed up,

12:12.921 --> 12:15.521
a rival tried to take him out,
this place was chaos.

12:15.557 --> 12:16.990
She's also uninsured,

12:17.026 --> 12:21.227
so we have to diagnose and treat
Claudia before Bell turfs her.

12:21.263 --> 12:22.529
Huh.

12:22.565 --> 12:24.997
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm looking for Claudia Webb.

12:25.033 --> 12:28.367
- She's in recovery right now and can't be seen.
- Yo!

12:28.403 --> 12:29.535
Felix.

12:29.571 --> 12:31.504
Go back to the waiting area.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.374
- Hell no. He's cool.
- Wait, who's cool?

12:34.410 --> 12:37.077
This cat right here.

12:37.113 --> 12:40.413
- Thanks for coming.
- How are you?

12:40.449 --> 12:42.816
Man, I'm freaking out, man.
I still haven't seen her.

12:42.852 --> 12:45.351
Do Claudia proud,
keep it together.

12:45.387 --> 12:46.986
For her, okay?

12:47.022 --> 12:49.422
I used to arrest this guy
every six months

12:49.458 --> 12:50.894
until Claudia took him in.

12:51.893 --> 12:53.659
Felix is one of many ex-cons

12:53.695 --> 12:55.361
she's hired
at her catering company.

12:55.397 --> 12:59.064
Claudia's an important part
of the Atlanta PD family.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.934
- Take special care of her.
- Don't worry.

13:01.970 --> 13:03.370
I got your word on that, homie?

13:03.406 --> 13:05.876
Yeah, you got my word.

13:08.978 --> 13:11.711
Appreciate it.

13:11.747 --> 13:14.547
Come on.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.820
Thank you for coming.

13:20.922 --> 13:23.222
You have a fifth metatarsal
fracture in your foot.

13:23.258 --> 13:25.591
But the good news is
it's-it's nonsurgical.

13:25.627 --> 13:27.427
Oh!

13:27.463 --> 13:29.929
Yeah, but that echocardiogram
is not so good.

13:29.965 --> 13:31.697
Let's keep this train moving.

13:31.733 --> 13:34.567
Ms. Evans, your aortic valve

13:34.603 --> 13:36.101
has calcified and thickened,

13:36.137 --> 13:38.438
resulting in critical
aortic stenosis.

13:38.474 --> 13:40.707
It's in urgent need
of replacement.

13:40.743 --> 13:42.141
How urgent?

13:42.177 --> 13:43.742
D-Does it require
general anesthesia?

13:43.778 --> 13:45.245
It does.

13:45.281 --> 13:46.980
A close friend of mine
went under

13:47.016 --> 13:49.883
and when he woke,
he was a different man.

13:49.919 --> 13:52.585
He couldn't even recognize
his own family.

13:52.621 --> 13:54.154
Yeah, she's right.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.926
General anesthesia can trigger
dementia in the <i>Cocoon</i> crowd.

13:58.294 --> 14:01.593
Now, there is another option.

14:01.629 --> 14:03.429
It's, uh, nonsurgical.

14:03.465 --> 14:05.368
- You interested? - Yes.
- Yes.

14:06.835 --> 14:09.903
Don't have the surgery and die.

14:09.939 --> 14:14.106
Hey. You... watch it, buddy.

14:14.142 --> 14:17.610
Dr. Austin is just being honest,
but I would rather die

14:17.646 --> 14:20.245
than go through life
being demented and confused.

14:20.281 --> 14:23.316
- Mom!
- I still got to go to my belly dancing classes.

14:23.352 --> 14:25.150
- - I like this lady.
- Pravesh.

14:25.186 --> 14:28.420
- Hallway, sidebar, now.
- York.

14:28.456 --> 14:30.459
Emergency, sorry, bye.

14:33.695 --> 14:35.194
It's Claudia.

14:35.230 --> 14:37.697
She started seizing
and her sats are dropping.

14:37.733 --> 14:39.164
Let's get her to the ICU.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.466
Push two of lorazepam

14:40.502 --> 14:44.104
and prep a gram
of phenytoin on standby.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.304
Okay, ready?

14:45.340 --> 14:46.840
Let's go. One...

14:46.876 --> 14:49.212
two... three.

15:00.855 --> 15:04.490
- Not now.
- Easy. I come in peace.

15:04.526 --> 15:06.393
I-I heard about
your sister. I'm sorry.

15:06.429 --> 15:08.894
- I trust she's doing better?
- Yeah.

15:08.930 --> 15:11.798
I have a troubled loved one
in my family as well.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.665
Believe me, I understand
what you're going through.

15:13.701 --> 15:15.201
He's doing great now.

15:15.237 --> 15:17.337
He was part of the program
over at Crossroads.

15:17.373 --> 15:20.874
Hasn't had a relapse since.
Four years clean.

15:20.910 --> 15:22.308
If you'd like,

15:22.344 --> 15:25.010
I can help get Jessie
into the program free of charge.

15:25.046 --> 15:26.678
Are you crazy?

15:26.714 --> 15:28.981
You are the last person
I want help from right now.

15:29.017 --> 15:31.053
Why don't you let me
take care of my family.

15:36.025 --> 15:38.028
Hmm.

15:40.028 --> 15:42.562
What's wrong with me?

15:42.598 --> 15:44.496
The seizures
have been continuing

15:44.532 --> 15:46.066
and we're trying
to figure out why.

15:46.102 --> 15:49.568
I have so many people,
they're like family to me.

15:49.604 --> 15:54.240
- They depend on me.
- I know. I've met some of them.

15:54.276 --> 15:56.909
I don't know
what happens to everyone

15:56.945 --> 15:59.078
if I'm not okay, you know?

15:59.114 --> 16:03.052
Look who it is.

16:05.387 --> 16:06.790
You look great.

16:08.456 --> 16:11.457
You're gonna be okay.

16:11.493 --> 16:14.527
I know.

16:14.563 --> 16:16.729
Whatever happens...

16:16.765 --> 16:18.731
look how far you've come.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.934
I am so proud of you.

16:21.970 --> 16:25.205
Don't talk like that.

16:25.241 --> 16:26.539
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:26.575 --> 16:29.542
I love you.
We all love you.

16:29.578 --> 16:31.673
I know you do.

16:39.454 --> 16:42.554
Dr. Austin, where are you going?

16:42.590 --> 16:45.424
To see a movie. <i>I Feel Pretty.</i>

16:45.460 --> 16:48.795
Centers on an ordinary woman
who struggles with feelings

16:48.831 --> 16:51.964
of inadequacy and insecurity
on a daily basis.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.067
Amy Schumer. She makes me laugh.

16:55.103 --> 16:56.502
What do you want?

16:56.538 --> 16:58.304
I wasn't comfortable
mentioning this earlier,

16:58.340 --> 17:01.141
but I can do a transcatheter
aortic valve replacement.

17:01.177 --> 17:02.942
So Yvonne can have
moderate sedation.

17:02.978 --> 17:07.247
- I need an attending.
- I'm not really a fan of awake surgeries.

17:07.282 --> 17:09.915
A risk we have to take.
You in or out?

17:09.951 --> 17:12.085
Great.

17:12.121 --> 17:14.621
I already bought my damn ticket!

17:14.656 --> 17:16.756
Are those Claudia's CSF results?

17:16.791 --> 17:19.259
Negative for
bacterial meningitis.

17:19.295 --> 17:21.161
So we're still nowhere closer
to figuring out

17:21.196 --> 17:23.529
- what's wrong with her.
- We're looking for a zebra.

17:23.565 --> 17:26.464
- But we've run every test.
- Yeah, now you know the drill.

17:26.501 --> 17:27.665
You talk.

17:27.702 --> 17:30.802
- To whom?
- Felix, Mambo, and Raq.

17:30.838 --> 17:34.606
Figure out everything
about Claudia.

17:34.642 --> 17:36.875
Habits, hobbies, favorite food.

17:36.911 --> 17:38.413
Hope we get closer
to a diagnosis.

17:43.719 --> 17:46.786
Awake? What do you mean awake?

17:46.822 --> 17:48.621
Awake, meaning not sleep...

17:48.657 --> 17:50.056
Don't you do that.

17:50.092 --> 17:52.525
It just... scares me.

17:52.561 --> 17:54.860
- When I had surgery...
- Surgery?

17:54.896 --> 17:56.562
For what, Yorkie?

17:56.598 --> 17:59.999
Mom, it wasn't a big deal.

18:00.035 --> 18:03.202
- Is it safe?
- Yes. And just regional anesthesia.

18:03.238 --> 18:05.305
- I'm in.
- Mama.

18:05.341 --> 18:07.539
I'm in.

18:07.575 --> 18:09.509
But you listen to me,
mister man.

18:09.545 --> 18:12.212
I'm sure you are
God's gift to medicine,

18:12.248 --> 18:14.012
but you mind your
Ps and Qs in the OR.

18:14.048 --> 18:15.882
If I hear anything
to the contrary,

18:15.918 --> 18:19.852
I will wield my pen like
a mighty sword. Ask Pravesh.

18:19.888 --> 18:23.756
I was thinking about something
else when you were talking.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.759
But don't bother repeating it.
I really don't care.

18:26.795 --> 18:29.895
I am going to save your
mother's life.

18:29.931 --> 18:31.196
You're welcome.

18:31.232 --> 18:33.165
So you've got the valve issue,

18:33.201 --> 18:35.667
asthma, varicose veins,

18:35.703 --> 18:37.337
a recent cataract surgery.

18:37.373 --> 18:39.105
Any other medical history
we should know about?

18:39.141 --> 18:40.240
- Nope, that is everything.
- Uh...

18:40.276 --> 18:42.342
Yorkie, honey, give us a minute.

18:42.378 --> 18:44.277
- But we don't have secrets, Mother.
- No, no, honey.

18:44.313 --> 18:46.378
I... Just one moment, sweetie.

18:46.414 --> 18:48.218
Okay?

18:50.084 --> 18:51.683
Close the door.

18:51.719 --> 18:54.420
I have, um...

18:54.456 --> 18:57.190
the little "C."

18:57.226 --> 19:00.626
The little "C"?
You mean big "C."

19:00.662 --> 19:03.429
- Cancer.
- No. Chlamydia.

19:03.465 --> 19:06.699
We call it the little "C"
in my retirement community.

19:06.735 --> 19:08.438
Yeah, you do.

19:09.938 --> 19:11.570
She likes European movies.

19:11.606 --> 19:13.439
- At least I can tell you that much.
- European movies...

19:13.475 --> 19:15.240
Mambo, not European movies,
she hates European movies.

19:15.276 --> 19:16.608
- She loves the outdoors.
- She does.

19:16.644 --> 19:18.478
- She does like the outdoors.
- She loves music.

19:18.514 --> 19:19.479
It doesn't matter
what kind of music.

19:19.515 --> 19:20.779
As long as she can groove to it,

19:20.815 --> 19:22.080
- she digs it.
- Loves food.

19:22.116 --> 19:23.750
Oh, she loves to cook...

19:23.786 --> 19:25.317
- The Hot Pocket things, the...
- The little Hot Pocket things.

19:25.353 --> 19:26.885
- She cooks a good meatloaf.
- She likes hiking, biking.

19:26.921 --> 19:28.121
She's at the water park,
she's always in...

19:28.157 --> 19:29.489
she was in the water
the whole day...

19:29.525 --> 19:31.790
- Yeah.
- It was nice. I mean, we do it every year.

19:31.826 --> 19:32.959
Wait.

19:32.995 --> 19:34.993
Wait, back up.
What did you just say?

19:35.029 --> 19:36.663
Uh, we did an event
for the Boys & Girls Club.

19:36.699 --> 19:38.298
- I know, but, uh...
- We-we always do an event for them.

19:38.334 --> 19:39.898
Wh-Where was it, again?

19:39.934 --> 19:41.134
- It was, uh, Running Rapids.
- Running Rapids.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.468
- Yeah, yeah, Running Rapids.
- Right?

19:42.504 --> 19:45.137
- Yeah.
- Yo, why are you asking all these questions?

19:45.173 --> 19:46.506
Did Claudia get in the water?

19:46.542 --> 19:47.773
- Yeah, man, lazy river.
- Obviously.

19:47.809 --> 19:50.712
- Slides.
- You know what, uh, I'll be right back.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.914
Hey! Yo! I got it!

19:54.950 --> 19:56.848
Conrad, I got it.

19:56.884 --> 19:58.984
Get this.

19:59.020 --> 20:02.321
Claudia was at Running Rapids.

20:02.357 --> 20:05.258
- Warm, stagnant water.
- So what are we thinking?

20:05.294 --> 20:06.792
<i>Naegleria fowleri.</i>

20:06.828 --> 20:08.294
98% fatal.
I don't like those odds.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.829
Yeah, but the signs
and the symptoms,

20:10.865 --> 20:13.132
they-they-they all line up.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.500
The CSF didn't show an amoeba.

20:15.536 --> 20:18.203
Because it was Gram stained.
I took a seminar

20:18.239 --> 20:20.440
on brain-eating amoebas
in med school.

20:20.476 --> 20:22.474
If they don't use
the Wright-Giemsa,

20:22.510 --> 20:23.776
it's almost impossible
to detect it.

20:23.812 --> 20:26.179
Tell the lab to rerun
the held sample

20:26.215 --> 20:28.651
with the Wright-Giemsa. Now.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.489
You need anything?

20:36.525 --> 20:39.491
Yes, go to work. I know you got
a million things to do.

20:39.527 --> 20:41.698
We're good.

20:43.565 --> 20:45.964
Nice to see you two
are happening again.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.567
Nothing's happening again.

20:47.603 --> 20:49.801
Well, it should be.

20:49.837 --> 20:52.337
- Nice to have you back, Jess.
- Conrad.

20:52.373 --> 20:54.740
When's the last time
you had a simple carb?

20:56.711 --> 20:57.846
It's been a minute.

21:03.751 --> 21:07.587
Eight months clean.

21:07.623 --> 21:10.323
Happiest I've been in forever.

21:10.359 --> 21:12.362
Just like that,
I threw it all away.

21:14.129 --> 21:17.663
Saddest part is,
I can't even tell you why.

21:17.699 --> 21:19.565
It happened. It's done.

21:19.601 --> 21:21.867
Now I just need to get you
into a treatment program.

21:21.903 --> 21:23.336
Too expensive.

21:23.372 --> 21:25.337
I'll do outpatient again.
I'll go to meetings.

21:25.373 --> 21:28.673
No, Jess, we got to get you
better for good this time.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.375
Whatever it takes.

21:30.411 --> 21:33.382
I'm such a liability.

21:35.883 --> 21:37.953
Thank you. Let me talk to her.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.753
You've saved me
so many times, Nicky.

21:41.789 --> 21:44.089
I can't keep doing this.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.692
- You don't deserve this.
- I'm not going anywhere.

21:46.728 --> 21:50.730
And don't you dare call yourself
a liability again.

21:50.766 --> 21:52.735
We all have our demons.

21:54.236 --> 21:56.969
You never judged me for mine.

21:57.005 --> 21:58.937
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

21:58.973 --> 22:03.408
I really do think you might need
to make Conrad some pasta.

22:03.444 --> 22:05.644
He won't eat it.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.379
<i>Dr. Okafor.</i>

22:07.415 --> 22:09.648
- What are you doing here?
- Well, one of your patients

22:09.684 --> 22:12.484
made it into my space,
so now I'm coming into yours.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.154
- York.
- He's very insistent.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.990
He also writes medical reviews

22:18.026 --> 22:19.959
on every major website
known to man.

22:19.995 --> 22:23.061
An awake surgery on his mother
with the Raptor?

22:23.097 --> 22:24.730
Whose grand idea was that?

22:24.766 --> 22:27.567
Well, now you'll have to control
his uncontrollable mouth.

22:27.603 --> 22:29.268
Isn't that your expertise?

22:29.304 --> 22:31.269
It's way below my pay grade.

22:31.305 --> 22:32.471
You put this plan into motion.

22:32.507 --> 22:34.106
This surgery falls on your head.

22:36.111 --> 22:38.510
I'm sorry. I don't get
it. What are we doing here?

22:38.546 --> 22:42.815
I'm the patient, wide awake
on the table.

22:42.851 --> 22:44.817
I'm trying to prevent you
from giving Yvonne

22:44.853 --> 22:47.153
a heart attack during surgery.
This isn't about me.

22:47.189 --> 22:48.587
Well, this certainly isn't
about me.

22:48.623 --> 22:50.289
Is that what you thought
was-was happening here?

22:50.325 --> 22:51.790
You were gonna train me?

22:51.826 --> 22:54.192
You're gonna groom me, huh?
Come on, girl.

22:54.228 --> 22:55.827
I don't want
this old lady to die

22:55.863 --> 22:57.930
because you can't keep
your mouth shut.

22:57.966 --> 23:00.365
Maybe this will help you
understand me better.

23:00.401 --> 23:02.702
My daddy looks like Chow Yun-Fat

23:02.738 --> 23:05.203
and my mother is the spitting
image of Mary J. Blige.

23:05.239 --> 23:06.672
Now, you're probably thinking
at least one of them

23:06.708 --> 23:08.673
served in the armed forces,
right? Wrong.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.343
They met at Vassar.

23:10.379 --> 23:13.279
A decade later they adopted
my left-for-dead ass.

23:13.315 --> 23:15.647
They were fantastic parents.

23:15.683 --> 23:18.317
My childhood was amazing,
but guess what.

23:18.353 --> 23:21.119
That didn't matter
'cause I was still mad as hell

23:21.155 --> 23:23.021
because the people
who actually made me

23:23.057 --> 23:25.124
tossed me away like trash.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.026
That's all I ever thought about.

23:27.062 --> 23:30.863
Why are you telling me this?

23:30.899 --> 23:33.798
Because I was just like you,
princess.

23:33.834 --> 23:37.737
Closed off, tied and,
and twisted all up inside,

23:37.773 --> 23:41.240
until I learned to use
that emotion as fuel.

23:41.276 --> 23:45.644
See, you think my behavior
is a weakness. No.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.879
It's my superpower.

23:47.915 --> 23:51.083
I walk into the OR with nothing

23:51.119 --> 23:52.984
but a clear mind
and steady hands.

23:53.020 --> 23:56.221
The only thing that stands
between life and death in an OR

23:56.257 --> 23:58.223
are these, and the very thing

23:58.259 --> 23:59.991
that you were trying
to breed out of me

24:00.027 --> 24:02.595
is why mine are better
than anyone else's.

24:02.631 --> 24:05.664
Now...

24:05.700 --> 24:09.335
you tell me something real
and make me believe it.

24:09.371 --> 24:11.904
I...

24:11.940 --> 24:15.907
do not need your superpower.

24:15.943 --> 24:19.110
Then you will make
a great surgeon.

24:19.146 --> 24:23.048
But you will never be
the best surgeon.

24:23.084 --> 24:26.087
That's too damn bad.

24:36.297 --> 24:39.131
Whoa. There it was.

24:39.167 --> 24:41.433
<i>Naegleria fowleri</i> confirmed.

24:41.469 --> 24:43.068
Brain-eating amoeba.

24:43.104 --> 24:44.703
So we administer miltefosine.

24:44.739 --> 24:46.071
Spoken like a true rookie.

24:46.107 --> 24:47.640
It's the only chance
for a patient

24:47.676 --> 24:50.442
with primary amebic
meningoencephalitis to survive.

24:50.478 --> 24:52.944
It's also incredibly expensive
with a short shelf life.

24:52.980 --> 24:55.146
So I'll give you one guess
who doesn't stock this drug.

24:55.182 --> 24:56.715
Chastain.

24:56.751 --> 24:59.317
And Claudia doesn't have the
money for a drug we don't have.

24:59.353 --> 25:00.720
Okay, so we fix this.

25:00.756 --> 25:02.154
I mean, there's got to be
something that we could...

25:02.190 --> 25:03.489
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

25:03.525 --> 25:05.257
We need the Glacial Sun.

25:05.293 --> 25:07.993
That's for inducing hypothermia

25:08.029 --> 25:09.561
in cardiac arrest patients.

25:09.597 --> 25:11.297
If we can lower
her body temperature

25:11.333 --> 25:13.098
to below what the amoeba
can survive

25:13.134 --> 25:15.100
and administer the miltefosine,

25:15.136 --> 25:16.735
we might have a shot.

25:16.771 --> 25:17.903
We also might freeze her
to death.

25:17.939 --> 25:20.172
It's possible. Call the CDC,

25:20.208 --> 25:22.407
and then call whoever
the CDC tells you to call

25:22.443 --> 25:25.110
and do not stop until you get
a dose of miltefosine.

25:25.146 --> 25:26.846
What do we do about the money?

25:26.882 --> 25:29.581
We do whatever it takes.
And keep this quiet.

25:29.617 --> 25:33.452
We don't want this popping up
on Bell's radar.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.587
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, uh,</i>

25:35.623 --> 25:38.758
I've been thinking
about what you said.

25:38.794 --> 25:41.192
Nic, if it's true,

25:41.228 --> 25:43.328
I couldn't live with myself.

25:43.364 --> 25:45.330
<i>Can you meet me at the clinic
at 4:00 a.m.,</i>

25:45.366 --> 25:46.598
<i>before the staff arrives?</i>

25:46.634 --> 25:48.334
Of course.

25:48.370 --> 25:49.669
And listen, Allie,
I know this is hard,

25:49.705 --> 25:51.037
but it's the right thing to do.

25:51.073 --> 25:52.437
You don't deserve
to go down with her.

25:52.473 --> 25:53.772
<i>I will get you Lily's files.</i>

25:53.808 --> 25:55.875
<i>Okay, see you then. Thank you.</i>

25:55.911 --> 25:57.912
<i>Gotta go, bye.</i>

26:08.657 --> 26:12.558
Ms. Evans, would you care
for some music?

26:12.594 --> 26:15.664
Yes. How nice. Tom Jones?

26:16.898 --> 26:19.231
I love Tom Jones.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.533
Dr. Okafor, time out, please.

26:21.569 --> 26:23.735
- Yvonne Aurora Evans.
- Correct.

26:23.771 --> 26:27.239
- Actually, that's "Aurr-rrora."
- Dr. Chu.

26:27.275 --> 26:28.240
You got to roll the middle "R."

26:28.276 --> 26:30.041
It's Spanish.

26:30.077 --> 26:32.411
- I'm not Spanish, but my mother loved...
- Date of birth.

26:34.449 --> 26:36.315
April 4, 1942.

26:36.351 --> 26:39.385
My boyfriend thinks
I was born in '47.

26:39.421 --> 26:42.221
He was born in '45,
but you know men.

26:42.257 --> 26:45.223
They prefer younger women.

26:45.259 --> 26:48.927
Am I gonna feel much? I mean,
I know I'm not gonna feel pain,

26:48.963 --> 26:51.329
- but...
- You know what you are going to feel, Ms. Evans?

26:54.268 --> 26:56.702
As good as new,
when this surgery is complete.

26:56.738 --> 26:58.671
How does that sound?

26:58.707 --> 27:02.040
That sounds wonderful.
Just wonderful.

27:10.317 --> 27:12.250
Were you aiming at something?

27:12.286 --> 27:14.019
Sorry,
I'm just-just frustrated.

27:14.055 --> 27:15.421
Claudia was diagnosed
with P.A.M.

27:15.457 --> 27:17.088
I know. I heard.

27:17.124 --> 27:19.191
And the CDC sent me to
the only company in the U.S.

27:19.227 --> 27:20.760
that supplies miltefosine.

27:20.796 --> 27:23.061
They're in Florida
and of course they're closed.

27:23.097 --> 27:24.529
I've been calling
the owner's cell phone

27:24.565 --> 27:26.132
and I keep getting
his voice mail.

27:26.168 --> 27:29.604
She's gonna die, man.

27:32.740 --> 27:35.875
I'm sorry, am I boring you
with this devastating news?

27:35.911 --> 27:37.542
It's late; he's sleeping.

27:37.578 --> 27:39.545
Yeah, awesome.
Super helpful. Thanks.

27:39.581 --> 27:40.945
What's the number?

27:40.981 --> 27:42.714
We'll tag-team him
until we get him,

27:42.750 --> 27:46.251
even if it takes all night.

27:46.287 --> 27:49.288
Oh, I remember visiting
my grandmother in the '60s.

27:49.324 --> 27:51.790
It was awful.

27:51.826 --> 27:56.261
I never imagined I'd be one
for a retirement communities.

27:56.297 --> 27:58.596
Oh, I remember...

28:15.650 --> 28:19.451
But these days,
they're like mini resorts.

28:19.487 --> 28:23.923
Mmm, I couldn't imagine

28:23.959 --> 28:25.790
I'd be one
for a retirement community.

28:25.826 --> 28:27.459
Is everything okay?

28:27.495 --> 28:30.996
Ms. Evans, best to stay quiet

28:31.032 --> 28:33.632
as we thread
the catheter through.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.838
Okey-dokey.

29:01.363 --> 29:03.529
<i>This is Kevin.</i>

29:03.565 --> 29:06.065
Kevin? It's you.

29:06.101 --> 29:08.334
It's Dr. Devon Pravesh,
Chastain Park, Atlanta.

29:08.370 --> 29:10.802
We left you, like...

29:10.838 --> 29:12.570
39 messages, yeah.

29:12.606 --> 29:14.405
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just urgent.

29:14.441 --> 29:17.843
I have a patient with primary
amebic meningoencephalitis,

29:17.879 --> 29:20.212
and we need miltefosine
as soon as possible.

29:20.248 --> 29:22.181
<i>Patient insured?</i>

29:22.217 --> 29:23.648
No.

29:23.684 --> 29:25.183
It's $48,000.

29:31.293 --> 29:33.259
It's not a problem.

29:33.295 --> 29:35.360
How fast can you get it here?

29:35.396 --> 29:37.930
Uh, the time it takes me to pull
on my pants and drive there.

29:37.966 --> 29:40.569
I'll see you
in about four hours.

29:42.871 --> 29:44.670
We need a lot of money.

29:44.706 --> 29:46.337
From where?

29:46.373 --> 29:48.206
48 Gs?

29:48.242 --> 29:50.342
Yes.

29:50.378 --> 29:54.346
- Brain-eating amoeba?
- Unfortunately.

29:54.382 --> 29:57.415
So, we get this money
for Claudia and she'll be good?

29:57.451 --> 29:59.550
It gives us a fighting chance
to save her life.

29:59.586 --> 30:01.587
Yes.

30:01.623 --> 30:03.187
But there could be
some permanent damage.

30:03.223 --> 30:06.058
We'll get the money.

30:06.094 --> 30:07.526
Yeah.

30:07.562 --> 30:10.462
Good luck.

30:16.904 --> 30:18.703
Sorry, I'm sorry. OR 3 ran over.

30:20.941 --> 30:22.273
This one's a doozy, huh?

30:22.309 --> 30:23.776
My gram-gram had chlamydia.

30:23.812 --> 30:25.109
- Uh, Jess.
- And I think... Hey, Chu.

30:25.145 --> 30:27.913
Yeah, estrogen and, uh, Viagra,

30:27.949 --> 30:29.448
they're helping gomers
hump like rabbits.

30:29.484 --> 30:30.615
The patient's awake.

30:30.651 --> 30:32.984
Are you blind,
illiterate, or both?

30:33.020 --> 30:36.254
The sign on the window says,
"Awake surgery in progress."

30:36.290 --> 30:38.423
- She made a mistake. Move on.
- You giving orders now?

30:38.459 --> 30:39.558
I'm giving advice.

30:41.296 --> 30:42.994
I don't feel well.

30:43.030 --> 30:45.964
What's happening?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.465
Abnormal rhythm.

30:47.501 --> 30:49.401
- What's happening to...? Oh!
- Put her under.

30:49.437 --> 30:51.436
You sure?

30:51.472 --> 30:54.239
I said put her under.

30:54.275 --> 30:56.775
Geez, this looks like
my eighth grade science project.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.777
If she dies, it's on me.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.078
My call, my ass.

31:00.114 --> 31:03.414
So do me a favor, relax.

31:03.450 --> 31:05.651
So, lowering Claudia's
body temp freezes the amoeba?

31:05.687 --> 31:07.786
It slows its progress,

31:07.822 --> 31:10.254
which hopefully can limit
the damage to her brain, it's...

31:10.290 --> 31:13.528
It'll buy us time
until the miltefosine arrives.

31:20.969 --> 31:22.800
Get me that miltefosine.

31:22.836 --> 31:24.635
We can't keep her cold for long.

31:24.671 --> 31:26.004
Pads. We need to cardiovert her.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.506
Push diltiazem.

31:29.411 --> 31:30.679
Get Dr. Nolan in here.

31:32.180 --> 31:33.945
Why? He's a trauma surgeon.

31:33.981 --> 31:35.481
I have my reasons.

31:35.517 --> 31:36.651
Clear.

31:37.684 --> 31:39.817
Sinus rhythm.

31:39.853 --> 31:42.954
We do not need a trauma surgeon
when there is no trauma.

31:42.990 --> 31:45.124
I'm here. What's going on?
What do we got?

31:46.928 --> 31:48.059
Is this Tom Jones?

31:48.095 --> 31:49.894
You know this is Tom Jones.

31:49.930 --> 31:52.830
Uh, a-am I needed
for this surgery?

31:52.866 --> 31:54.532
No, you are not needed
for this surgery, Dr. Nolan,

31:54.568 --> 31:55.968
but your colleagues

31:56.004 --> 31:58.871
need to lay eyes on someone
who gets it,

31:58.907 --> 32:02.340
someone who listens, who learns
and who understands...

32:02.376 --> 32:03.975
What it's like to let your
emotions get the best of you?

32:04.011 --> 32:06.644
Just shut your mouth.

32:06.680 --> 32:10.048
This is unfortunate.

32:10.084 --> 32:11.717
I believe it was Nietzsche

32:11.753 --> 32:13.551
who said that many
are stubborn in...

32:13.587 --> 32:15.820
You've served your purpose.
Now get out.

32:24.632 --> 32:28.000
Oh, man, thank you.
Thank you.

32:28.036 --> 32:29.635
Thanks.

32:41.950 --> 32:44.348
Hey, how's Jessie?

32:44.384 --> 32:46.785
- She's better.
- Huh.

32:46.821 --> 32:49.020
Uh, what exactly
is going on here?

32:49.056 --> 32:50.689
Fund-raiser.

32:50.725 --> 32:53.724
Reformed criminals doing
a legal drug deal

32:53.760 --> 32:55.359
with more cash
than I've ever seen.

32:55.395 --> 32:57.729
While my sister
is detoxing from legal drugs

32:57.765 --> 32:59.731
bought illegally.

32:59.767 --> 33:00.798
Hey, you.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.567
Uh, look, Mambo, this...

33:02.603 --> 33:04.036
Ooh... Uh, yep.

33:04.072 --> 33:06.038
- Nurse Nevin, right?
- Yeah.

33:06.074 --> 33:08.043
Yeah, you took care of
my Uncle Deebo a few years back.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.608
Deebo. Oh, I love him.

33:10.644 --> 33:12.544
- He's a big teddy bear.
- Yeah.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.879
He always would brag
about how good you were to him.

33:14.915 --> 33:16.815
I think he had a little crush,
to tell you the truth.

33:16.851 --> 33:18.049
Oh, how's he doing?

33:18.085 --> 33:19.617
He's dead as hell.

33:19.653 --> 33:22.386
Well, diabetes
finally took him out.

33:24.124 --> 33:26.157
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

33:26.193 --> 33:27.593
But, anyway,
I never got a chance

33:27.629 --> 33:28.926
to say thank you in person.

33:28.962 --> 33:31.596
- Hey, just doing my job.
- Yeah?

33:31.632 --> 33:33.898
Well, you ever need me
to return the favor,

33:33.934 --> 33:36.468
you just holler.

33:36.504 --> 33:39.274
Hey, Mambo.

33:41.142 --> 33:42.941
Actually, there...

33:42.977 --> 33:46.644
there is a situation
I could use a little help with.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.914
You are quickly becoming
a lost cause to me, Dr. Okafor.

33:49.950 --> 33:53.584
Your behavior in the OR...
in general... is unacceptable.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.988
Well, I inspire and transform
those around me

33:56.024 --> 33:57.488
in order to breed the best.

33:57.524 --> 33:58.857
I do not compromise.

33:58.893 --> 34:01.026
- You're delusional.
- Yeah?

34:01.062 --> 34:03.361
Well, when you win
a three-peat JAMA publication

34:03.397 --> 34:05.763
and an ASA Medallion
in the same year, then, maybe,

34:05.799 --> 34:07.098
I'll consider your diagnosis.

34:07.134 --> 34:09.266
But until then,
if you're in my OR,

34:09.303 --> 34:12.469
you either exit or evolve.

34:12.505 --> 34:14.339
That's funny.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.841
I didn't peg you for a doctor
who cared about accolades.

34:16.877 --> 34:18.275
Well, I do.

34:18.312 --> 34:20.277
I am who I am.

34:20.313 --> 34:23.484
That will never change.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.676
What's up, man?

34:50.712 --> 34:52.543
Can I help you with something?

34:52.580 --> 34:55.647
Yeah. My little sister Nic

34:55.683 --> 34:59.555
wanted me to return the favor.

35:04.859 --> 35:06.691
Thanks for coming
all this way, Kevin.

35:06.727 --> 35:08.060
Ah, it wasn't so bad.

35:08.096 --> 35:09.727
I once drove to Kentucky
to deliver a dose.

35:09.763 --> 35:12.064
Did that patient make it?

35:12.100 --> 35:14.232
Ah, afraid not.

35:14.268 --> 35:15.334
Never would have imagined

35:15.370 --> 35:18.102
a pharma CEO
to hand-deliver medication.

35:18.138 --> 35:19.738
Yeah.

35:19.774 --> 35:23.040
Well, I worked in Big Pharma
for 20 years.

35:23.076 --> 35:24.575
Couldn't take it anymore.

35:24.611 --> 35:27.111
Believe it or not,
I put people before profit.

35:27.147 --> 35:29.881
Wait, so you only supply
miltefosine?

35:29.917 --> 35:31.383
Big Pharma refuses.

35:31.419 --> 35:35.120
Not enough people
contract <i>Naegleria.</i>

35:35.156 --> 35:36.555
No patients, no money.

35:36.591 --> 35:37.856
How do you profit?

35:37.892 --> 35:40.024
I don't. 48 grand a pop's

35:40.060 --> 35:42.794
what I need to keep the lights
on and the drug stocked.

35:42.830 --> 35:44.930
Speaking of which, my daughter
is getting married tomorrow.

35:44.966 --> 35:46.964
I should probably get
back on the road.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.301
Uh, who should I, uh... invoice?

35:49.337 --> 35:51.270
Yeah, uh...

35:51.306 --> 35:54.606
Hey, pay that man his...

35:54.642 --> 35:57.308
- Uh...
- So you're the guy?

35:57.344 --> 36:00.448
Drove all the way from Florida
to deliver Claudia's medicine?

36:01.948 --> 36:04.018
It's all there.

36:09.122 --> 36:10.321
For your records.

36:10.357 --> 36:12.660
- No records.
- No records.

36:15.196 --> 36:16.828
Thank you, Kevin.

36:16.864 --> 36:18.497
I really hope this trip
was worth it for you.

36:18.533 --> 36:20.432
It certainly will be
if Claudia survives.

36:20.468 --> 36:21.633
Let me know, okay?

36:21.669 --> 36:24.205
Will do.

36:28.276 --> 36:30.841
<i>You've reached Allie.
Please leave a message.</i>

36:30.877 --> 36:34.115
<i>Hi, Allie, it's Nic.
I'm pulling up now.</i>

37:10.518 --> 37:12.521
Allie?

37:24.265 --> 37:26.335
Allie?

37:43.009 --> 37:45.182
- Tell me about this man that you're very close to.
- No.

37:45.218 --> 37:47.986
- You met him.
- Oh, there he is.

37:48.022 --> 37:49.354
Bring it in for the real thing.

37:49.390 --> 37:51.093
Oh.

37:53.027 --> 37:55.260
- All right, big guy.
- Thank you.

37:55.296 --> 37:57.863
- You're all right by me.
- Thank you, York.

37:57.899 --> 37:59.263
Now, let's get you guys home,
yeah?

37:59.299 --> 38:01.165
- Yeah.
- All right.

38:02.870 --> 38:05.437
- Just get my flowers, don't forget.
- Yeah.

38:05.473 --> 38:08.707
It's clear you've chosen
the right profession, young man.

38:08.743 --> 38:09.874
Thank you.

38:17.652 --> 38:20.285
Yorkie, why is there
a syrup bottle up your butt?

38:20.321 --> 38:21.886
You pulled up

38:21.922 --> 38:24.558
the wrong "Y. Evans."

38:26.960 --> 38:28.330
I'm so sorry.

38:31.598 --> 38:33.765
It's okay.

38:33.801 --> 38:35.437
I have chlamydia.

38:37.904 --> 38:41.439
Those... look...

38:41.475 --> 38:43.874
good.

38:43.910 --> 38:46.645
How we feeling?

38:46.681 --> 38:49.017
Can you tell us your name?

39:00.194 --> 39:02.993
Yo, Felix.

39:03.029 --> 39:05.062
Hey, what's up?

39:05.098 --> 39:06.430
What?

39:06.466 --> 39:09.066
Oh, what's up?

39:09.102 --> 39:10.234
She okay?

39:10.270 --> 39:13.337
She's awake?

39:13.373 --> 39:15.843
This one's all you.

39:17.310 --> 39:19.276
Yeah.

39:19.312 --> 39:20.812
She's awake.

39:20.848 --> 39:22.346
And she's okay.

39:22.382 --> 39:23.948
In fact, she's doing great.

39:23.984 --> 39:26.750
And she can't wait
to see all you guys.

39:28.455 --> 39:30.354
Hey, man.

39:30.390 --> 39:31.857
You did good, man.

39:31.893 --> 39:33.862
You did real good.

39:37.131 --> 39:38.296
Oh!

39:38.332 --> 39:40.198
I love you, D.

39:45.705 --> 39:47.475
Oh, God.

39:48.975 --> 39:51.546
Man, not again.

39:53.413 --> 39:56.147
You know, only four people
in the U.S. have

39:56.183 --> 39:58.549
ever survived <i>Naegleria fowleri.</i>

39:58.585 --> 40:00.285
You just saved the fifth.

40:00.321 --> 40:01.653
It would not have been great
if you'd frozen Claudia

40:01.689 --> 40:04.154
to death, but you didn't.

40:04.190 --> 40:05.689
No, today you gambled

40:05.725 --> 40:08.392
on unorthodox medicine
and you won.

40:08.428 --> 40:10.961
Had you not won...

40:10.997 --> 40:12.564
you'd be walking
out of this hospital

40:12.600 --> 40:14.198
for the last time,

40:14.234 --> 40:15.332
to join the ranks
of the unemployed

40:15.368 --> 40:16.537
along with Nurse Nevin.

40:17.939 --> 40:19.174
This is my hospital.

40:20.174 --> 40:22.674
It's not your casino.

40:22.710 --> 40:24.676
Enjoy your drinks.

40:24.712 --> 40:27.412
Ah.

40:27.448 --> 40:29.247
Wait, wait.

40:29.283 --> 40:31.515
What just... what just happened?

40:31.551 --> 40:32.850
He said you're amazing.

40:34.955 --> 40:38.156
And he can fire you
whenever he wants.

40:38.192 --> 40:39.857
Hello.

40:39.893 --> 40:41.359
<i>They set me up.</i>

40:41.395 --> 40:42.560
Who set you up?

40:42.596 --> 40:44.495
Where are you?

40:44.531 --> 40:46.932
Atlanta Detention Center.

40:46.968 --> 40:49.234
I'm on my way.

40:49.270 --> 40:51.535
No, Conrad, listen to me.

40:51.571 --> 40:53.037
There's nothing
you can do for me right now.

40:53.073 --> 40:55.709
There's something else
I need help with.

40:56.944 --> 40:58.442
There you are.

40:58.478 --> 40:59.711
I was just about to call you.

40:59.747 --> 41:00.912
I tried Nic, like,
a hundred times.

41:00.948 --> 41:02.046
She's not answering.

41:02.082 --> 41:03.848
Where you going, Jessie?

41:03.884 --> 41:05.683
Inman Park.
Gonna meet up with some friends,

41:05.719 --> 41:07.519
just clear my head.

41:07.555 --> 41:09.453
It'll be good for me.

41:09.489 --> 41:11.689
Thanks for everything yesterday.

41:11.725 --> 41:13.959
Sit down, Jessie.

41:13.995 --> 41:16.428
Yeah, I'm good.

41:16.464 --> 41:19.064
Did Nic send you?

41:19.100 --> 41:20.765
Is that why she's not
answering my calls?

41:20.801 --> 41:23.968
You know,
I don't need this right now.

41:24.004 --> 41:25.903
And I've been discharged.
Dr. Whatever said I could go.

41:25.939 --> 41:28.573
Uh, Nic got you a place
at Crossroads;

41:28.609 --> 41:30.107
it's a three-week program.

41:30.143 --> 41:31.642
- Crossroads.
- Mm-hmm.

41:31.678 --> 41:33.410
Nice.

41:34.515 --> 41:35.914
See, this is what happens.

41:35.950 --> 41:37.982
People make decisions
about my life,

41:38.018 --> 41:40.484
- and that's not okay.
- We'll do this together.

41:40.520 --> 41:41.586
Yeah, I said I'll do the
outpatient stuff,

41:41.622 --> 41:42.720
I'll go to meetings...

41:42.756 --> 41:44.589
You tried it last time,
and it didn't work.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.758
I'm leaving.

41:46.794 --> 41:48.392
Move, Conrad.

41:48.428 --> 41:50.060
You almost died last night.

41:50.096 --> 41:52.129
Would you have come
to my funeral if I did?

41:52.165 --> 41:54.765
You care now?

41:54.801 --> 41:56.968
We're family?

41:57.004 --> 41:58.502
Please.

41:58.538 --> 42:01.740
You're still
just passing through.

42:01.776 --> 42:05.145
Well, I'm here right now,
and I'm not leaving without you.

42:06.881 --> 42:08.783
Where the hell is my sister?

42:10.817 --> 42:12.283
Your sister's going through
a hard time right now...

42:12.319 --> 42:14.022
- Is she okay?
- She will be.

42:17.058 --> 42:18.689
Your sister loves you very much.

42:18.725 --> 42:20.591
She loves more than anything.

42:20.627 --> 42:24.332
If you don't want to do it
for you, do it for her.

42:26.399 --> 42:28.235
I wasn't always
the one screwing up.

42:31.071 --> 42:33.872
Oh.

42:33.908 --> 42:37.011
I guess you don't know Nic
as well as you think you do.

42:40.681 --> 42:42.046
I'll be waiting outside.

42:42.082 --> 42:43.682
We'll leave when you're ready.
