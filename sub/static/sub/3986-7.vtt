00:21.200 --> 00:24.300
Now they're on line.

00:27.668 --> 00:30.034
- This is masked as Marlo's
cell number?

00:30.133 --> 00:31.599
How the fuck how?

00:31.736 --> 00:33.402
- Spoofed to imitate
a call stream

00:33.502 --> 00:36.070
like it's
a phone company switch.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.335
We can put any digits in
we want.

00:38.436 --> 00:40.636
Meanwhile, phone company
paperwork on the case

00:40.768 --> 00:42.902
has the cell
we gave to Sydnor.

00:42.969 --> 00:46.503
It's fairly basic shit.

00:51.704 --> 00:53.537
- Now, stick to
the script.

00:53.669 --> 00:55.703
We don't want
any tell-tales.

00:55.803 --> 00:58.037
Even with
the voice modulator,

00:58.171 --> 01:00.604
you're exposed here.

01:00.704 --> 01:03.969
Seven-baker-fourteen.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.070
Bga, go ahead fourteen.

01:06.172 --> 01:07.072
Fourteen.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.637
I got a vehicle
blocking an entrance.

01:08.804 --> 01:12.172
Four hundred pressman.

01:17.737 --> 01:21.336
- What the--
Oh, shit.

01:25.174 --> 01:26.107
Templeton.

01:26.174 --> 01:27.474
Hey, you--

01:27.541 --> 01:29.808
Where do you get off,
you sick little twist?

01:29.908 --> 01:31.175
Sexual?

01:31.273 --> 01:32.174
I'm not sexual with them.

01:32.271 --> 01:33.338
I'm not abusive with them.

01:33.439 --> 01:34.639
How dare you write
that in your paper

01:34.739 --> 01:36.174
without knowing
nothing about me--

01:36.273 --> 01:37.373
What?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.271
- Biting's not sex,
it's biting.

01:39.373 --> 01:40.808
I'm not sick like that.

01:40.908 --> 01:43.741
- Whoa, hang on--
Hang on, hang on.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.672
- Maybe I should
come bite you.

01:45.774 --> 01:47.207
Would you like that,
scotty?

01:47.308 --> 01:48.942
I bet you would
like that.

01:49.008 --> 01:49.908
Am I right?

01:50.008 --> 01:51.475
You write about me
like I'm sick.

01:51.642 --> 01:53.376
You're the sick one,
you know that?

01:53.475 --> 01:55.941
Is that why you like me,
scotty?

01:56.041 --> 01:56.942
Is that why?

01:57.041 --> 01:59.408
Fuck me--

01:59.542 --> 02:01.910
Yeah, this is Holley,
Baltimore homicide.

02:02.041 --> 02:06.109
I need a trap-and-trace on case
oh-eight, h-one-fourteen.

02:06.208 --> 02:09.275
Cell phone is in use
right now.

02:09.374 --> 02:11.642
- I could come bite you;
you tell me how sexual it is.

02:11.744 --> 02:12.843
Okay, hang on.

02:12.943 --> 02:14.843
Who, where are you--

02:14.944 --> 02:16.677
- Well, here's what's
happening now.

02:16.776 --> 02:18.409
You humiliate me
like that?

02:18.511 --> 02:21.611
You mortify me like that
in front of my father?

02:21.778 --> 02:23.211
My father's father?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.610
Listen to me,
smack daddy, crack daddy,

02:25.712 --> 02:28.979
little baby whack daddy,
here's what's happening.

02:29.045 --> 02:31.678
You ain't never
going to find them anymore.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.578
You ait never gonna
see them no more.

02:33.677 --> 02:35.145
I'm sending you
something right now.

02:35.243 --> 02:36.611
You take a good look
at this guy,

02:36.742 --> 02:38.776
because you ain't ver
going to see him no more.

02:38.879 --> 02:40.579
Hey, okay.

02:40.678 --> 02:45.046
Don't hang up.
Can we--

02:45.148 --> 02:46.214
Oh, shit.

02:46.311 --> 02:47.211
Did you get McNulty?

02:47.311 --> 02:48.245
Just his voicemail.

02:48.345 --> 02:49.612
Oh, Christ.

02:49.712 --> 02:54.713
That was--
That was him.

02:54.814 --> 02:56.613
Again!

02:56.713 --> 02:58.345
Nice bawlmer accent.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.180
It's my heritage.

03:00.279 --> 03:01.713
- Has traced
the phone in question

03:01.812 --> 03:03.678
to pier five
on pratt street.

03:03.779 --> 03:06.814
All units respond to that twenty
and detain anyone present

03:06.913 --> 03:09.313
pending the arrival
of a duty officer.

03:09.414 --> 03:10.716
- One-baker-ten,
copy that.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.982
I'm rolling.

03:12.147 --> 03:14.614
- One-ker-thirteen,
I'm almost there.

03:14.715 --> 03:15.715
Kga to all units.

03:15.815 --> 03:16.815
Be advised
that we're looking

03:16.949 --> 03:21.515
for a ten-thirty individual
on a cell phone.

03:24.214 --> 03:26.183
- Anyone on a phone?
- Not that I saw.

03:26.282 --> 03:27.183
Just some people
moving through,

03:27.281 --> 03:28.481
but it could be anybody.

03:28.614 --> 03:30.182
Let's just fan out
and take names.

03:30.282 --> 03:31.382
Go down this road.

03:31.482 --> 03:32.482
Get their names
over there.

03:32.616 --> 03:34.349
Get everybody up
in this area now.

03:34.449 --> 03:35.347
Stop.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.816
What the hell is this?

03:37.916 --> 03:38.849
- Hey, let go of me.
- Get your hands up--

03:39.017 --> 03:39.917
Get on the ground now.

03:40.016 --> 03:42.483
- Get your hands up!
Step out!

03:42.617 --> 03:46.985
- Get everody over there
and get their cell phones.

03:47.119 --> 03:48.552
- I need everyone to take out
yourell phones

03:48.651 --> 03:50.284
and place them on the table
in front of you.

03:50.383 --> 03:52.283
- Stop,
he didn't do anything.

03:52.384 --> 03:54.551
What are you doing?

04:13.487 --> 04:14.387
Sarge, we got him.

04:14.486 --> 04:15.954
- Bullshit.
- I got him on tape.

04:16.052 --> 04:16.952
- The goof
actually called.

04:17.052 --> 04:19.486
- Yeah, yeah,
it was sweet--

04:19.587 --> 04:23.688
Hey, what'd I miss?

04:25.952 --> 04:27.486
- He went off
on a tangent.

04:27.654 --> 04:28.853
Said he wanted to bite me.

04:28.953 --> 04:30.154
- What?
Bite you how?

04:30.251 --> 04:32.319
- Scott, are you saying
that he threatened to--

04:32.419 --> 04:36.253
- Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

04:36.353 --> 04:39.520
Holy Christ.

06:24.962 --> 06:26.197
- So are we partners
or what?

06:26.229 --> 06:27.229
No, Clay.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.596
I don't pick
so much as a single juror

06:29.697 --> 06:32.230
without a full amount
of my fee being paid.

06:32.329 --> 06:34.330
If you want Billy Murphy
on your case,

06:34.397 --> 06:36.230
you got to pay
to put him there.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.330
- I got a taste for you
right up front.

06:38.396 --> 06:40.596
A good,
five-figure taste.

06:40.665 --> 06:43.231
But you asking for me to pay
a winner's fee right up front,

06:43.331 --> 06:46.364
and you know what?
I ain't a winner yet.

06:46.498 --> 06:49.166
Right now, with the sword
hanging over my head,

06:49.330 --> 06:51.598
I don't have the kind of
financial support at my disposal

06:51.697 --> 06:55.165
that I would ordinarily be
able to rely upon, you feel?

06:55.264 --> 06:57.066
- So the money boys
are laying off, huh?

06:57.166 --> 07:00.533
- Oh, they thinkin' short when
they should be thinkin' long.

07:00.632 --> 07:02.531
Shameful shit.

07:02.631 --> 07:06.532
25,000, 25,000 more
when you seat a jury.

07:06.633 --> 07:07.901
I don't work that way.

07:07.968 --> 07:11.068
- I know you don't, partner,
I know you don't.

07:11.168 --> 07:13.634
And normally, I wouldn't dream
of asking you to suit up

07:13.766 --> 07:16.066
for game day
with my tab, as it is.

07:16.166 --> 07:19.799
- 200,000 when I get you out
from under this mess.

07:19.866 --> 07:21.934
And Clay,
don't fuck me.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.469
Don't even think about fucking me
out of a single part of that fee.

07:25.566 --> 07:28.101
- Oh, Billy, you talk
as if you don't know me.

07:28.202 --> 07:31.103
I'm disappointed.
I am.

07:31.202 --> 07:33.068
My brother,
let's be fair.

07:33.168 --> 07:34.835
I'm providing you
with the opportunity

07:35.002 --> 07:37.735
to go head to head
with the state's attorney

07:37.835 --> 07:40.335
in a case that's gonna be
front page news.

07:40.435 --> 07:42.268
For all that profile?

07:42.368 --> 07:45.335
Sheet, partner,
you should be payin' me a fee.

07:45.434 --> 07:49.302
- Seriously, dawg, for 20,000
cash to my campaign committee,

07:49.338 --> 07:51.236
I'll get myself indicted
federal,

07:51.402 --> 07:53.203
let you go to trial
on that.

07:53.303 --> 07:54.769
Beat the feds
like a stepchild,

07:54.837 --> 07:57.838
an' really make a name
for yourself.

07:57.937 --> 07:58.837
Fuck you?

07:58.938 --> 08:01.404
Naw, son,
I'm gonna make you.

08:01.503 --> 08:03.403
Motherfuckers gonna be
wipin' they ass

08:03.503 --> 08:04.838
with johnnie Cochran's
memory,

08:04.937 --> 08:06.270
and carryin'
your business card

08:06.370 --> 08:07.938
in every damn pocket
before we done.

08:08.039 --> 08:09.571
no.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.106
I already got more rep
than any lawyer would ever nee

08:13.206 --> 08:20.207
why don't you save that
silver-tongued bullshit for the jury?

08:20.307 --> 08:21.840
Right.

08:21.939 --> 08:24.073
No, nothing since.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.706
Alright.

08:28.706 --> 08:30.673
- Me, barlow and kincaid
been sittin' here

08:30.773 --> 08:33.773
like the fucking maytag
repairmen, growing piles.

08:33.873 --> 08:35.707
Nothing, not a call.
Then, bang.

08:35.841 --> 08:36.874
No luck at the harbor.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.975
We were tracking the g.p.s.
Then it just goes dead.

08:39.073 --> 08:40.239
Area of pier five.

08:40.340 --> 08:41.506
Where's McNulty right now?

08:41.606 --> 08:42.871
- He's over
at the newspaper.

08:42.972 --> 08:46.773
- Let's hear
that motherfucker again.

08:46.874 --> 08:51.776
Hey, you-- where do you get
off, you sick little twist?

08:51.874 --> 08:59.677
- Sounds like some gearhead
from dundalk.

08:59.876 --> 09:02.609
- And emotionally,
how was he?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.777
He sounded pissed.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.442
At you, personally?

09:05.541 --> 09:08.443
- Like I told you,
he sd I humiliated him

09:08.540 --> 09:10.708
by writing
that the biting was sexual.

09:10.809 --> 09:15.877
At the end, he offered
to come here and bite me.

09:15.977 --> 09:17.343
I didn't really
respond to that.

09:17.509 --> 09:19.275
Okay.

09:19.441 --> 09:21.275
Did he sound like
the same guy?

09:21.342 --> 09:22.710
What do you mean?

09:22.810 --> 09:24.711
- Did it sound like the same
voice you heard on the first call?

09:24.876 --> 09:26.710
- Oh, right.
Yeah.

09:26.811 --> 09:28.245
No, actually.

09:28.344 --> 09:29.712
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

09:29.845 --> 09:32.278
It was the same,
but this time I noticed

09:32.377 --> 09:34.212
he had a real thick
bawlmer accent.

09:34.278 --> 09:35.845
Real thick.

09:35.944 --> 09:37.643
- You didn't notice
that theirst time, huh?

09:37.744 --> 09:41.478
- I guess I did,
but I forgot.

09:41.578 --> 09:42.812
Did I screw up
in any way?

09:42.911 --> 09:44.213
- No.
Not at all.

09:44.344 --> 09:46.912
- Listen, we reserve the right
to make this decision,

09:47.011 --> 09:49.345
but that said,
would running these photos

09:49.444 --> 09:51.445
in any way
impair the investigation?

09:51.545 --> 09:52.479
I don't think so.

09:52.545 --> 09:54.712
Fact is, we need
as many eyes as we can

09:54.814 --> 09:56.081
looking for
this homeless guy.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.546
- You don't know
where is guy is, huh?

09:57.645 --> 09:59.278
He could be--

09:59.379 --> 10:01.013
- Could already be
a victim, sure.

10:01.115 --> 10:04.415
Jesus.

10:04.512 --> 10:06.580
That's Charles and conway.

10:06.679 --> 10:08.147
I wonder if he's a regular
out there.

10:08.215 --> 10:10.047
- He had to have used
a different phone though.

10:10.214 --> 10:12.646
Had to have been a cell phone
if he sent you these.

10:12.781 --> 10:17.014
- That's true. But, again,
you can't print anything

10:17.115 --> 10:18.481
about where
he's calling from.

10:18.581 --> 10:20.280
We're trying to get up
on that cell phone.

10:20.381 --> 10:21.482
- What should I do
if he calls again?

10:21.549 --> 10:23.483
- Keep him on the line
as long as you can.

10:23.580 --> 10:24.680
Don't spook him.

10:24.782 --> 10:28.215
Guy likes to rant.
Let him do his thing.

10:28.316 --> 10:29.582
You okay?

10:29.683 --> 10:30.583
me?

10:30.683 --> 10:32.217
Yeah, I guess.

10:32.316 --> 10:33.751
- I wouldn't worry;
he's just using you.

10:33.849 --> 10:36.217
He needs you.

10:36.348 --> 10:38.348
- I kind of resent that,
actually.

10:38.448 --> 10:39.782
Oh, I dunno.

10:39.883 --> 10:42.983
It's workin' out pretty well
for both of you, right?

10:43.084 --> 10:47.784
Gentlemen--
Thanks for these.

10:51.783 --> 10:53.349
- Callin' Vincent
on his cell all morning,

10:53.484 --> 10:54.717
he still ain't answer.

10:54.851 --> 10:55.951
Ain't got time for this.

10:56.052 --> 10:57.618
Re-up time
will come due,

10:57.717 --> 11:03.218
we still ain't picked up
the mannitol.

11:03.318 --> 11:06.219
What the fuck?

11:08.220 --> 11:09.787
Yo, Vincent.

11:09.885 --> 11:11.786
Where you at?

11:11.885 --> 11:17.253
Manny? Manny?

11:17.352 --> 11:19.686
Shit.

11:31.885 --> 11:32.952
Omar.

11:33.054 --> 11:34.253
- Why you still
alive then?

11:34.387 --> 11:37.421
- He say tell Marlo
he out in the streets, waitin'.

11:37.519 --> 11:39.054
Say this whole damn city
gonna know

11:39.154 --> 11:41.121
Marlo ain't man enough
to come down in the streets.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.187
He get the stash?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.253
Yo, cherry.

11:43.387 --> 11:45.155
He blew manny up
as soon as he got inside.

11:45.222 --> 11:46.588
He was gonna do me, too.

11:46.688 --> 11:48.222
- How the fuck
he get inside?

11:48.323 --> 11:50.389
- Manny open up
to go on the food run,

11:50.522 --> 11:52.888
an' this dicksucker
was right there.

11:53.021 --> 11:55.055
He knew
we was the stash.

11:55.224 --> 11:57.423
Ain't need to be told shit.

11:57.489 --> 11:59.757
He just knew.

12:04.055 --> 12:05.856
- Four key of raw;
flushed.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.924
- Hey, yo, cherry.
You gonna untie me, right?

12:09.022 --> 12:13.857
C'mon, nigga,
untie me--

12:13.959 --> 12:15.557
Seriously, steven.

12:15.658 --> 12:18.258
If you can't afford it,
that's fine, I understand.

12:18.356 --> 12:19.890
And if you think this clown
is gonna hold me off

12:20.058 --> 12:20.990
and keep the statehouse,

12:21.092 --> 12:22.625
then I know
you've got to hedge your bets

12:22.725 --> 12:24.060
given how much you're
waiting on fm annapolis.

12:24.159 --> 12:25.725
But if you're gonna choose
a side on this thing,

12:25.792 --> 12:27.591
please, do it early.
That's all I'm saying.

12:27.692 --> 12:29.093
I hear ya, Tom.

12:29.157 --> 12:30.524
You know what, I'm going
to write out a check today,

12:30.624 --> 12:31.992
and send it out the door.

12:32.091 --> 12:35.159
- That's great, steven;
really, I do appreciate it.

12:35.259 --> 12:39.526
Can you, um,
can I ask you to consider--

12:39.626 --> 12:41.425
- I'll double down on that
for my wife, too.

12:41.593 --> 12:44.425
For your wife, too.

12:44.526 --> 12:48.426
That's just great, really.

12:48.527 --> 12:50.995
Yeah, thanks for going
the extra mile on this.

12:51.093 --> 12:52.193
No problem, Tom.

12:55.292 --> 12:56.659
Photographs?

12:56.793 --> 13:00.293
- He messaged digital photos
of the possible victim

13:00.360 --> 13:02.227
to the "sun" reporter.

13:02.361 --> 13:03.995
I've canvassed this guy's
regular corner,

13:04.160 --> 13:05.927
and he has indeed been missing
a couple days.

13:06.026 --> 13:07.460
We got these photos
from the newspaper,

13:07.561 --> 13:09.795
but we want to be able to
intercept any future images--

13:09.896 --> 13:11.796
Hence the amended order.

13:11.894 --> 13:13.627
Correct.

13:13.728 --> 13:17.295
- Can we catch photos
with our city equipment?

13:17.362 --> 13:18.461
Actually, no.

13:18.561 --> 13:20.261
We're still bumping around
in the 20th century.

13:20.362 --> 13:21.996
But howard county
has the right software

13:22.096 --> 13:23.395
on a couple
of their computers.

13:23.495 --> 13:27.396
You need two?

13:27.496 --> 13:28.764
- Yeah, in case
one computer goes down,

13:28.864 --> 13:30.296
we got the other one
as back-up.

13:30.396 --> 13:34.232
We don't wanna Miss our shot
at this nut.

13:34.363 --> 13:38.231
Well, good hunting.

13:38.396 --> 13:41.030
Thank you, judge.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.364
Oh, Ronnie.

13:45.464 --> 13:48.865
You briefed your boss?

13:48.930 --> 13:50.631
And he's calling the mayor,
right?

13:50.766 --> 13:53.031
- And Rawls too,
I imagine.

13:53.132 --> 13:56.198
- Ah, pretty little fella
gets himself elected

13:56.333 --> 13:57.700
on a law and order ticket.

13:57.798 --> 13:59.498
Crime doesn't go down much,

13:59.597 --> 14:03.065
and then, a couple weeks before he starts
gearing up to announce for governor,

14:03.166 --> 14:04.966
some wingnut starts
killing people,

14:05.066 --> 14:07.134
taking photographs,
sending 'em to the newspaper.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.234
You know something?

14:08.332 --> 14:12.699
You may wanna check
the governor's alibi.

14:12.799 --> 14:15.234
You know?

14:17.235 --> 14:21.502
Oh--thanks.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.201
- You couldn't
make thirty?

14:29.332 --> 14:32.000
Twenty?

14:32.102 --> 14:34.268
Ninety-two.

14:34.368 --> 14:35.635
I'm gonna tell you
something.

14:35.735 --> 14:36.902
There are a lot of people

14:37.001 --> 14:39.236
who want Tommy Carcetti
to be their fuckin' governor.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.704
And I can't imagine
what they're thinking.

14:41.803 --> 14:44.069
Ninety-two, Norman,
in a single morning.

14:44.171 --> 14:45.070
It is a new record.

14:45.169 --> 14:46.636
- The motherfucker
killing homeless guys?

14:46.735 --> 14:47.802
He grabbed one
off the street,

14:47.903 --> 14:48.903
wrapped a ribbon
on his wrist,

14:49.002 --> 14:50.503
sent a photo
to the "Baltimore sun,"

14:50.602 --> 14:51.802
saying we won't
find the body.

14:51.902 --> 14:53.170
He--what?

14:53.267 --> 14:56.436
- The newspaper's
gonna run the photos.

14:56.537 --> 14:57.872
Bill Rawls.

14:57.970 --> 15:01.436
I need him
on the line now.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.836
* you rascal you

15:06.004 --> 15:10.371
* I'll be glad when you're dead,
you rascal you *

15:10.538 --> 15:15.439
ah--aw, look at ya,

15:15.539 --> 15:18.905
ya baby-bumpin'
motherfucker.

15:19.004 --> 15:21.205
Look at you.

15:22.471 --> 15:23.371
Let's go.

15:23.472 --> 15:24.806
Deputy wants
as much of my squad

15:24.906 --> 15:27.106
as I can wrangle upstairs
right now.

15:27.204 --> 15:32.371
We're going large Richard
on McNulty's serial killer.

15:34.538 --> 15:36.305
I'm worçing my cases.

15:36.406 --> 15:38.608
- Bunk,
command performance.

15:38.773 --> 15:40.141
The deputy wants bodies.

15:40.241 --> 15:41.974
The mayor's spewing
over this thing.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.775
I'm not going.

15:43.874 --> 15:45.774
- What? You don't see those
on my sleeve?

15:45.874 --> 15:47.241
Plain as fuckin' day,
Bunk.

15:47.374 --> 15:49.608
- I'm doing police work
here.

15:49.674 --> 15:52.241
In fact, I have a fresh angle
on last year's major case,

15:52.374 --> 15:55.307
on which I'm the sole
remaining investigator.

15:55.474 --> 15:57.775
So fuck your stripes
and fuck McNulty,

15:57.876 --> 16:00.776
and fuck your
big-dick red ball.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.243
If you can't work with that,
then just write me the fuck up,

16:03.408 --> 16:07.576
and ship my ass
to a trial board.

16:14.543 --> 16:16.710
- So, for starters, alma
stays with the investigation,

16:16.876 --> 16:17.942
and detectives
downtown.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.876
You don't go home
without checking for updates

16:19.976 --> 16:21.942
before the E-dot
and double-dot editions.

16:22.043 --> 16:23.710
So the case file is McNulty,

16:23.811 --> 16:25.978
with the rest of his squad
as immediate support.

16:26.076 --> 16:28.443
Lieutenant d'addario's shift
will man the wiretap.

16:28.512 --> 16:30.079
- In addition to
alma and Scott,

16:30.144 --> 16:31.610
olesker will have
a column coming.

16:31.711 --> 16:32.978
Fletcher, I want you
on homeless react,

16:33.077 --> 16:35.043
also interviews with
advocates and experts

16:35.146 --> 16:36.446
talking up the problem.

16:36.510 --> 16:37.711
Melody,
you get on the phone

16:37.812 --> 16:40.678
with the whitecoats at
clifton t. Perkins or wherever,

16:40.779 --> 16:42.146
and work up a sidebar
on what it means

16:42.246 --> 16:43.745
when a whackjob
kills somebody

16:43.878 --> 16:45.277
and wants to talk
to reporters about it.

16:45.378 --> 16:47.079
- Greg, I've been
scanning the casework,

16:47.178 --> 16:50.445
and I note that while there have been
numerous field interviews and canvasses;

16:50.546 --> 16:51.914
we haven't done much
with background work

16:52.012 --> 16:53.013
on victims and families.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.746
If you could take charge
of that--

16:54.878 --> 16:57.246
Colonel tomlin,
we're going to need tactical

16:57.379 --> 16:59.745
to provide surveillance cars
and undercover decoys

16:59.879 --> 17:01.079
where the homeless gather.

17:01.248 --> 17:03.148
We need to be
in the street, proactive.

17:03.247 --> 17:06.380
This case is as much about
preventing another abduction or murder

17:06.446 --> 17:08.080
as it is about making
an arrest--

17:08.180 --> 17:10.513
- Thing is, we can't work
this one with the phone.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.647
We need to be in the street,
at eye level--

17:12.780 --> 17:15.181
- We need to keep the media
as part of the equation.

17:15.347 --> 17:17.314
This reporter
that's bn contacted--

17:17.413 --> 17:18.414
He's in the middle of it.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.314
That may be a way
to solve this thing.

17:20.446 --> 17:21.914
- You're in the middle
this now,

17:22.015 --> 17:23.949
so while we're still going to
present this as a first-person piece

17:24.114 --> 17:25.946
on your latest contact
with the killer,

17:26.050 --> 17:28.383
alma's still going to interview
you for the mainbar.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.582
- Now, McNulty's preliminary
checks with shelter workers,

17:30.683 --> 17:32.383
and a canvass
of conway and Charles,

17:32.482 --> 17:34.648
indicates that our victim
is indeed missing,

17:34.748 --> 17:36.115
but when we get
a full I.D.,

17:36.217 --> 17:39.017
we need toun every connection
to make sure this isn't a hoax.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.450
Chief, we're going to need to
pull bodies from district ops

17:41.548 --> 17:43.382
to give homicide
their own surveillance arm.

17:43.482 --> 17:46.650
And having had some experience
in the politics of staffing,

17:46.816 --> 17:48.750
I leave it to McNulty
to pick the people.

17:48.849 --> 17:50.151
- For once, people,
I am assured

17:50.252 --> 17:52.383
that the resources we need
to work this story

17:52.483 --> 17:54.218
will be there for us.

17:54.315 --> 17:58.984
So let's surround this mess
and report the hell out of it.

17:59.118 --> 18:00.786
This one's got legs.

18:00.885 --> 18:02.851
- I am now told,
by the mayor directly,

18:02.952 --> 18:04.586
that there will be
no overtime restrictions,

18:04.683 --> 18:07.484
no staffing limits
on this case.

18:07.585 --> 18:10.685
So put this case down.

18:10.784 --> 18:15.485
- Police work.
Whaddaya know?

18:17.653 --> 18:18.787
Good day.

18:18.885 --> 18:20.485
Six g-packs so far.

18:20.585 --> 18:23.019
New package be
droppin' them fiends.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.886
Yeah.

18:24.986 --> 18:28.087
Probably need
one more re-up.

18:28.188 --> 18:29.888
- Career day
on the corner, hanh?

18:29.988 --> 18:32.989
Step off, nigga.

18:35.821 --> 18:37.256
- Hey, Mike,
check th out.

18:37.354 --> 18:39.088
"certified
hydrotherapist,

18:39.186 --> 18:42.086
"experience with
geri-atric patients,

18:42.155 --> 18:44.256
sinai hospital
outpatient clinic."

18:44.355 --> 18:45.455
Jerry who?

18:45.588 --> 18:48.257
- Whatever, how about this--
"dental front desk,

18:48.419 --> 18:51.222
high quality dental office
seeks front desk."

18:51.321 --> 18:52.522
- What do they mean,
like furniture?

18:52.688 --> 18:53.722
- Like a secretary,
I guess.

18:53.855 --> 18:55.989
- Man, you ain't even
ever been to no dentist.

18:56.089 --> 18:59.555
- "Huhvac maintenance
supervisor."

18:59.655 --> 19:01.022
- What the fuck
is a huhvac?

19:01.123 --> 19:02.823
- "H-V-a-c."
Maybe they spelled it bad.

19:02.922 --> 19:05.388
"systems manager in
a deadline driven environment."

19:05.456 --> 19:07.090
- Man, ain't
nothing there.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.089
And even if there was,
you ain't sixteen,

19:09.189 --> 19:11.023
and y'all got to pick up bug
after three--

19:11.158 --> 19:13.191
- Hey, hey, hey,
hang on, hang on--

19:13.287 --> 19:14.354
"exotic dancer,

19:14.456 --> 19:17.522
"downtown financial district
lunch time hours--

19:17.624 --> 19:21.658
Must be flexible
in body and mind."

19:21.792 --> 19:24.992
Now we talking--

19:27.358 --> 19:30.125
Heeeeeey--
Make it rain on 'em.

19:30.224 --> 19:31.125
Make it rain.

19:31.225 --> 19:32.226
Hold up.

19:32.326 --> 19:35.059
Time out.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.192
Fuck did I do?

19:39.292 --> 19:41.093
- If we don't know,
then you do.

19:41.192 --> 19:44.592
This is bullshit.

19:48.492 --> 19:51.392
Yo, don't forget
about bug.

19:51.492 --> 19:53.560
- As this is an ongoing
investigation,

19:53.660 --> 19:55.095
I'm going to ask
that you direct questions

19:55.193 --> 19:57.827
to the police officials
best equipped to answer.

19:57.928 --> 20:00.962
These new developments in the case
of the homeless slayings in our city

20:01.093 --> 20:04.961
are troubling and tragic
and unacceptable.

20:05.127 --> 20:06.427
We are now doing
everything possible

20:06.526 --> 20:08.760
to locate and identify
the individual

20:08.860 --> 20:12.595
depicted in the photographs sent
to the "Baltimore sun" today.

20:12.694 --> 20:15.695
We are endeavoring to protect
other homeless citizens,

20:15.795 --> 20:17.061
and we are
pursuing the suspect

20:17.163 --> 20:19.429
with every means
at our disposal.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.695
I have made clear
to my police commanders

20:21.862 --> 20:24.595
that they have my full
confidence and the authority

20:24.696 --> 20:27.064
to employ whatever resources
they require.

20:27.164 --> 20:29.329
And let mee unequivocal--

20:29.429 --> 20:31.130
This man
will be brought to justice.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.329
Thank you.

20:32.428 --> 20:36.130
- Mr. Mayor--
Mr. Mayor--

20:54.265 --> 20:56.165
Voice and digital photos.

20:56.267 --> 21:02.066
He calls again,
you'll capture either one.

21:02.165 --> 21:03.531
- I can do those background
checks myself, Jay/

21:03.633 --> 21:04.533
there's no need to--

21:04.633 --> 21:05.534
You heard the deputy.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.533
He specifically
assigned Greggs.

21:07.632 --> 21:08.900
- Greggs
has an open triple.

21:08.997 --> 21:11.031
- And this squad
has your serial killer,

21:11.133 --> 21:12.101
and the case is shit-hot.

21:12.199 --> 21:13.566
- Jay, I don't need--
- Jimmy--

21:13.665 --> 21:15.632
You are the point man on the
motherfucker who's now missing.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.467
You don't have time to be working
backgrounds on the older cases.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.469
It goes to Greggs;
end of fucking story.

21:21.566 --> 21:26.534
Now...
What else do you need?

21:28.467 --> 21:30.468
- I'm gonna need those surveillance
teams as this thing sprawls,

21:30.567 --> 21:32.301
but for right now,
let me pull this guy's I.D.

21:32.468 --> 21:34.367
As fast as I can,
figure what he's about.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.834
And after that,
I'll have more to spin off.

21:35.933 --> 21:37.466
- Voice analysis
of the call?

21:37.568 --> 21:40.202
- Shit, I don't believe
in that shit.

21:40.269 --> 21:41.368
Next thing I know,
you'll want me to go

21:41.469 --> 21:43.203
to fucking Quantico
with this fucking thing.

21:43.336 --> 21:46.771
As a matter of fact--

21:46.867 --> 21:50.868
You don't believe in behavioral
forensics, Dr. Moreland?

21:50.969 --> 21:53.237
- I don't believe in much
of anything at this point.

21:53.335 --> 21:54.335
- Well, it doesn't
fucking matter

21:54.403 --> 21:56.404
what any of us believe
at this point.

21:56.502 --> 21:59.971
You turned on
the fuckin' tap, Jimmy.

22:00.035 --> 22:04.103
They're finally paying
for police work again.

22:08.037 --> 22:10.871
Proud of yourselves?

22:13.137 --> 22:14.404
We're close to Marlo.

22:14.504 --> 22:15.938
A week or two at most.

22:16.038 --> 22:18.639
- How does it feel getting
Greggs pulled off her triple?

22:18.772 --> 22:21.807
How does it feel knong that you
got surveillance teams out there,

22:21.905 --> 22:24.071
and district units,
and tactical--

22:24.173 --> 22:25.404
All of 'em chasin'
bullshit.

22:25.504 --> 22:26.871
- We're gonna use the
surveillance teams, actually.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.337
They're gonna help us
bring in the case, Bunk.

22:28.437 --> 22:29.438
I n't even want to know

22:29.538 --> 22:30.906
whose picture you got
running in the paper,

22:30.972 --> 22:35.674
or where that motherfucker
actually happens to be.

22:38.338 --> 22:42.173
- Names and addresses;
whater you got.

22:42.241 --> 22:43.240
Jimmy--

22:43.340 --> 22:44.541
Don't ll yourself.

22:44.674 --> 22:46.407
Shit.

22:46.507 --> 22:47.607
Don't worry, son.

22:47.707 --> 22:51.575
I got you covered
on all this.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.973
Listen,
one other thing.

22:55.074 --> 22:59.373
I, uh--I'm getting'
my kid for an overnight.

22:59.475 --> 23:01.176
Where do I get
kid's furniture?

23:01.273 --> 23:02.274
Ikea.

23:02.374 --> 23:05.708
Ah, see y'all.

23:05.809 --> 23:07.742
Shame on y'all.

23:07.810 --> 23:10.744
I mean it.

23:14.010 --> 23:14.909
Trace lab.

23:15.074 --> 23:16.175
It's Moreland.

23:16.276 --> 23:17.743
You just called.

23:17.877 --> 23:21.280
- I know,
and I'm callin' again.

23:21.375 --> 23:24.776
I need the tracework
on oh-six-h-two-seven-one,

23:24.844 --> 23:26.278
and I need it now.

23:26.408 --> 23:30.044
- I know, he hasn't been
around to it yet.

23:30.111 --> 23:31.211
Well, tell him I called,

23:31.309 --> 23:32.576
and tell him
I'm gonna keep calling

23:32.676 --> 23:40.411
until he feels
my fucking pain, a-ight?

23:40.544 --> 23:43.411
Gift-wrapped.

23:46.011 --> 23:48.845
Number one.

23:58.612 --> 23:59.946
Fuck.

24:00.047 --> 24:03.614
How the fuck do they expect me
to get this shit done on my own?

24:03.679 --> 24:06.946
Broke ass department
ain't even payin'--

24:07.046 --> 24:08.580
You okay?

24:10.481 --> 24:11.515
It's fucked up.

24:11.614 --> 24:12.949
It's all fucked up, okay?

24:13.047 --> 24:14.115
I could make a red
go to black

24:14.248 --> 24:16.248
'cept for these cheap
motherfuckers--

24:16.312 --> 24:19.681
Whaddaya got?

24:19.779 --> 24:23.146
- Good snitch put the finger on
an eyeball wit been duckin' me.

24:23.247 --> 24:26.581
He lays up at this one girl's
place at athol avenue, right?

24:26.682 --> 24:29.316
Comes in late,
but he leaves early.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.182
so?

24:31.283 --> 24:33.616
- So I don't mind sittin' on the
place all night long an' not get paid.

24:33.714 --> 24:35.082
But it's a garden
apartment.

24:35.249 --> 24:37.049
Parking lots
on both sides,

24:37.150 --> 24:38.250
and if he decides
to park on the street

24:38.415 --> 24:39.250
and walk across the grass,

24:39.349 --> 24:42.183
he still has
the fucking patio doors.

24:42.249 --> 24:44.449
Two more men do it?

24:44.549 --> 24:46.783
Yeah, and two more cars, yeah.

24:46.882 --> 24:49.250
- I got more bodies than
I can use on my serial thing.

24:49.349 --> 24:51.817
Lemme make a call,
hook you up with two tac guys.

24:51.918 --> 24:54.085
You tell 'em you're sitting
on a twenty that I gave you.

24:54.248 --> 24:55.614
I'll write up the hours
under my file.

24:55.716 --> 24:57.448
And you can do that?

24:57.618 --> 25:00.885
Go with God.

25:13.719 --> 25:16.085
- Can you make out
who that is?

25:16.186 --> 25:18.819
Yeah.

25:18.921 --> 25:20.087
Look at you.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.020
Not even blinking.

25:25.386 --> 25:26.987
Not that I blame you

25:27.120 --> 25:31.519
after what this heinous
motherfucker did to you.

25:35.654 --> 25:38.855
Still, this right here
is vicious.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.755
I mean, whoever did this
had a real time;

25:40.855 --> 25:43.956
now you know
what I'm saying?

25:44.055 --> 25:51.388
Now, I know it wasn't you
because with all due respect,

25:51.490 --> 25:55.058
you don't have the physicality
to do this kind of damage.

25:55.189 --> 25:56.756
I mean,
whoever did this

25:56.856 --> 26:00.757
had to be a full-grown
and powerful individual--

26:00.923 --> 26:05.023
A fearsome individual--

26:05.125 --> 26:07.456
You see
what I'm sayin'?

26:07.557 --> 26:10.090
You the murder police.

26:10.190 --> 26:13.523
How the fuck
would I know?

26:13.621 --> 26:15.321
- Is this spot good
for a stand-up?

26:15.423 --> 26:18.523
- Let's go with
a wide shot on this.

26:36.623 --> 26:39.157
- ...say they are hopeful
thathe renewed attention

26:39.260 --> 26:41.325
to their son's death
a few years ago

26:41.425 --> 26:42.492
will lead police to--

26:42.592 --> 26:44.293
Kinda formula, I know.

26:44.358 --> 26:47.426
Anecdotal lede,
nut graf, best quote--

26:47.526 --> 26:49.426
- It works as a sidebar,
but for tomorrow,

26:49.525 --> 26:50.993
let's stretch it some, huh?

26:51.158 --> 26:54.458
Really spend some time with
some of these people, you know?

26:54.561 --> 26:57.893
What I mean is, sometimes,
the weakest stuff in a story

26:58.062 --> 26:59.894
is the shit with
quotation marks around it.

27:00.062 --> 27:02.361
You got a guy telling
how rough it is on the street,

27:02.461 --> 27:03.427
it really doesn't
have much pull.

27:03.528 --> 27:06.196
But if you can describe him
as he really is,

27:06.262 --> 27:08.360
tell his story
in moments.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.628
Look, tomorrow,
get back in the shelters,

27:10.727 --> 27:13.095
and the soup kitchens,
and just be with folk.

27:13.161 --> 27:14.961
I don't even care
if you file copy on it.

27:15.061 --> 27:16.527
I mean, if something
presents itself as a story,

27:16.628 --> 27:17.562
great, but if not,

27:17.661 --> 27:20.296
just spend the day
being with people.

27:20.396 --> 27:23.298
I'm not interested in what can
be quoted or counted on this one.

27:23.395 --> 27:25.029
I'm interested
in what feels true.

27:25.130 --> 27:29.629
- I'm in, thirty inches, with room
for price's stuff from the hall.

27:29.729 --> 27:30.830
Scott?

27:30.997 --> 27:31.831
Five minutes.

27:31.930 --> 27:33.396
- We're coming up
on first edition.

27:33.497 --> 27:35.265
Three minutes.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.630
- We had him in that,
what do you call it,

27:38.729 --> 27:39.996
rehabilitation--

27:40.097 --> 27:41.362
Four times.

27:41.462 --> 27:44.197
We're not rich people.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.031
Henry's on disability.

27:46.098 --> 27:49.564
- We get him out,
he makes all kinds of promises,

27:49.665 --> 27:54.132
but, well, you know--

27:54.231 --> 27:55.597
I'm sorry.

27:55.765 --> 28:03.600
- The last time, we decided
we wouldn't be there for him.

28:03.699 --> 28:05.766
We knew he'd probably
die out there;

28:05.865 --> 28:08.933
if the drugs get him,
we knew that.

28:09.032 --> 28:13.200
But this thing in the newspaper,
this sex stuff.

28:13.301 --> 28:16.034
The biting or whatever.

28:16.132 --> 28:23.299
Jesus, nobody
deserves that.

28:23.433 --> 28:25.366
- You see what I have
a problem with, right?

28:25.435 --> 28:27.002
I mean, the first-person
is one thing.

28:27.069 --> 28:28.901
I know he needs to put himself
in the story--

28:29.001 --> 28:30.268
It's essential.

28:30.433 --> 28:32.967
- But this business about him
being out there day and night

28:33.069 --> 28:34.136
with the homeless--

28:34.235 --> 28:36.135
I mean, this stuff
about sharing their--

28:36.233 --> 28:38.867
Quote, darkest corners
with them, unquote--

28:38.969 --> 28:43.970
- He's writing
more as an essayist.

28:44.068 --> 28:47.169
- We've got a column
from olesker, front metro.

28:47.269 --> 28:50.803
I mean, it's pretty powerful
without being purple.

28:50.902 --> 28:53.069
But this stuff
that Scott's written,

28:53.238 --> 28:55.871
it makes it sound like he's been
ling with the homeless for weeks.

28:55.970 --> 28:58.736
He spends one night
under the j.f.x.,

28:58.839 --> 29:01.206
another half day quoting people
in a homeless shelter.

29:01.369 --> 29:03.270
It ain't exactly studs terkel.

29:03.368 --> 29:04.635
- You don't think the piece
should run as it is?

29:04.737 --> 29:08.272
- I mean, we have him
interviewed about the call

29:08.370 --> 29:09.370
from the killer
in alma's mainbar.

29:09.469 --> 29:10.369
We have his quotes.

29:10.470 --> 29:12.003
But the rest
of this stuff,

29:12.104 --> 29:14.204
he's acting like he's
taking his life in his hands,

29:14.370 --> 29:17.072
he walks another highway
at night?

29:17.171 --> 29:18.271
I mean, this is
our fucking city.

29:18.439 --> 29:19.639
This ain't beirut.

29:19.738 --> 29:23.105
I respect your concerns.

29:23.171 --> 29:25.471
I'll take the piece
and mo it as my own edit.

29:25.607 --> 29:28.474
How's that?

29:34.039 --> 29:36.505
Okay.

29:38.639 --> 29:40.274
- And while they declined
to talk on camera,

29:40.372 --> 29:43.141
the parents of jonathan boland
say they are hopeful

29:43.208 --> 29:46.275
that the renewed attention to
their son's death a few yes ago

29:46.407 --> 29:48.372
will lead police
to his killer.

29:48.472 --> 29:52.674
For channel six news,
I'm Patricia--

29:52.842 --> 29:55.474
Media's going crazy.

29:55.575 --> 29:57.875
City hall, too.

29:57.943 --> 30:00.843
But for once, we're getting
what we need to do the job.

30:00.942 --> 30:02.409
How does it feel?

30:02.540 --> 30:03.975
Forbidden.

30:04.074 --> 30:05.240
I feel like
at any moment,

30:05.408 --> 30:06.243
they're gonna find out
how much we're spending

30:06.341 --> 30:08.676
and shut us down.

30:08.775 --> 30:11.042
You don't have all this
in your head yet?

30:11.142 --> 30:13.341
- I just want to
go over it all again.

30:13.442 --> 30:15.144
We finish voir dire
by lunch,

30:15.242 --> 30:17.775
and then,
it's opening arguments.

30:17.878 --> 30:19.977
- For Mr. Bond.
It's on him.

30:20.044 --> 30:21.344
- He needs
a strong second.

30:21.411 --> 30:26.978
He needs me to know
this case inside and out.

30:31.976 --> 30:33.343
How much longer, Lester?

30:33.477 --> 30:36.312
- If Marlo has a code,
we can break the code.

30:36.408 --> 30:37.876
That's a given.

30:38.011 --> 30:39.178
How long?

30:39.277 --> 30:45.644
Depends on the code,
doesn't it?

30:45.778 --> 30:48.377
- Quicker we bring this in
and shut it down,

30:48.545 --> 30:50.079
the safer
we'll all be.

30:50.179 --> 30:52.246
I mean, Landsman wants me
to go to fucking Quantico,

30:52.345 --> 30:54.346
let the F.B.I.
Do a profile.

30:54.445 --> 30:56.912
- Might learn something
about yourself.

30:56.979 --> 30:58.811
It's not funny, Lester.

30:58.913 --> 31:01.347
This shit's bigger than
I ever thought it would be.

31:01.445 --> 31:02.980
The whole fuckin' city--

31:03.079 --> 31:08.713
Yeah, Jay.

31:08.813 --> 31:13.713
No. No, I don't need
an academy class

31:13.848 --> 31:18.647
to help with a canvass
near this guy's corners.

31:18.748 --> 31:21.850
Well, I don't need
any additional canvassing.

31:21.915 --> 31:23.915
What? You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

31:24.014 --> 31:26.281
Because I already know the name
of the missing smokehound.

31:26.379 --> 31:27.446
Yeah, his name,
his d.o.b.

31:27.548 --> 31:30.914
And his last known address
at a city shelter.

31:31.013 --> 31:33.914
Lawrence butler,
3/10/1951,

31:34.015 --> 31:37.116
400 west street,
south Baltimore men's shelter.

31:37.282 --> 31:38.749
- Well, how did you
get all of that?

31:38.849 --> 31:41.549
how?

31:41.648 --> 31:42.916
Police work.

31:43.084 --> 31:44.750
When I have more leads,
sergeant,

31:44.849 --> 31:46.516
I'll be able to use
the extra manpower you give me

31:46.650 --> 31:47.583
and run this shit down.

31:47.650 --> 31:49.785
But until then,
will you back off, Jay?

31:49.851 --> 31:55.320
Yeah,
just back the fuck off.

31:55.482 --> 31:57.217
Trouble with making this thing
into a red ball?

31:57.415 --> 31:59.883
People started treating it
like a fucking red ball.

32:00.017 --> 32:01.918
Jesus!

32:02.052 --> 32:03.484
Get me out of this,
Lester.

32:03.584 --> 32:06.284
As fast as you can.

32:06.385 --> 32:09.953
- Senator--
Senator--

32:10.051 --> 32:13.319
Senator, there have been rumors
of a last minute plea offer.

32:13.420 --> 32:18.420
- How can I plead
to what I didn't do?

32:18.587 --> 32:19.886
- What're you reading
there, senator?

32:19.987 --> 32:21.854
This here?

32:21.952 --> 32:24.518
"prometheus bound,"
an ancient play,

32:24.619 --> 32:26.787
one of the oldest we have,
about a simple man

32:26.886 --> 32:29.520
who was horrifically punished
by the powers that be

32:29.619 --> 32:33.587
for the terrible crime of trying
to bring light to the common people.

32:33.688 --> 32:38.688
In the words of aeschylus,
"no good deed goes unpunished."

32:38.789 --> 32:42.689
I cannot tell you how much
consolation I find in these slim pages.

32:42.787 --> 32:43.988
- One more question,
senator--

32:44.055 --> 32:46.120
- Ladies and gentlemen, I do
believe I have my day in court

32:46.256 --> 32:49.957
and I will see you inside.

32:56.621 --> 32:57.788
- City hall
wants an update.

32:57.889 --> 33:01.823
What do we know
about our missing mope?

33:07.190 --> 33:08.923
What else?

33:09.056 --> 33:10.723
- Sending a tape of the call
down to Quantico,

33:10.823 --> 33:11.923
along with the case file.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.356
They'll review,
then meet with us.

33:13.457 --> 33:16.357
- You gotta hit every downtown
shelter or mission there is--

33:16.456 --> 33:18.091
You want bodies for that?

33:18.189 --> 33:19.890
I'm taking christeson.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.423
The rookie?

33:21.523 --> 33:22.923
- Yeah, he'll ask
the extra question.

33:22.991 --> 33:24.057
He's hungry. He's--

33:24.157 --> 33:28.024
I need more bodies,
I'll let you know.

33:32.359 --> 33:33.927
- Heard what you did
with christeson,

33:34.024 --> 33:35.225
letting him go
on his own case,

33:35.391 --> 33:38.293
while you carry him
and two surveillance teams.

33:38.458 --> 33:39.726
Your shit is right, Jimmy.

33:39.824 --> 33:41.226
Thanks.

33:41.359 --> 33:43.760
- So I got another one
for ya.

33:43.860 --> 33:44.994
You remember
the rape-murder I had?

33:45.091 --> 33:46.357
Bolton hill job?

33:46.490 --> 33:48.491
Brother-in-law
of my rapist--

33:48.625 --> 33:49.926
Last year
wouldn't talk to me,

33:50.025 --> 33:52.559
but now, his wife
just got collared,

33:52.659 --> 33:55.027
and if she gets locked up,
his kids go to family services,

33:55.193 --> 33:57.293
so he's desperate to deal.

33:57.425 --> 34:00.426
The problem is,
he's in the new York system--

34:00.526 --> 34:02.228
Elmira, newburgh,
one of those places.

34:02.328 --> 34:03.961
Anyway, I get a road car
and expenses,

34:04.060 --> 34:06.392
I can put it down.

34:09.163 --> 34:12.495
Jimmy, he strangled
a 20-year-old,

34:12.594 --> 34:15.295
stuffed her
under her bed.

34:15.393 --> 34:17.862
- Okay, give my c.c.
To motor pool.

34:17.962 --> 34:19.760
I'll bury the expenses
and the o.t. In my file.

34:19.862 --> 34:22.195
Thanks, brother.

34:27.197 --> 34:31.164
- Ain't you the lil'
king of diamonds.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.731
Homicide.

34:36.797 --> 34:38.163
Naw, he's on the street
right now.

34:38.263 --> 34:42.063
Call back
in a couple hours.

34:42.264 --> 34:51.733
- On second thought, gonna have Norris
with me on that canvass today, boss.

34:51.862 --> 34:54.629
- And with every single transaction
you've described, detective,

34:54.797 --> 34:57.799
the money was routed through
the senator's personal account

34:57.899 --> 34:59.799
and then
withdrawn as cash--

34:59.900 --> 35:01.601
Yes, sir.

35:01.699 --> 35:02.999
- Often
in the same amounts?

35:03.165 --> 35:04.664
Often the exact amounts,

35:04.732 --> 35:06.200
sometimes
slightly smaller amounts,

35:06.300 --> 35:09.366
but always within a day
of the initial deposit.

35:09.533 --> 35:11.000
- Thank you,
detective Freamon.

35:11.099 --> 35:13.633
Your honor,
no further questions.

35:13.732 --> 35:16.301
- Cross examination,
Mr. Murphy.

35:16.365 --> 35:19.633
- No questions,
your honor.

35:40.934 --> 35:42.301
You got a number?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.301
What?

35:43.400 --> 35:44.467
Number on a slip.

35:44.568 --> 35:46.101
If you get a number,
I might could find you a seat.

35:46.236 --> 35:47.203
It's Mac an' cheese today.

35:47.302 --> 35:50.669
- Uh, no, um,
I'm a newspaper reporter.

35:50.768 --> 35:51.870
- Oh, so you got
what to eat then.

35:52.001 --> 35:54.668
- Yeah, came down here
just to hang out,

35:54.769 --> 35:56.837
and get with
some homeless people.

35:56.935 --> 35:58.103
- How come whenever
y'all be wanting homeless,

35:58.203 --> 35:59.936
y'all come
to the soup kitchens?

36:00.038 --> 36:01.037
- You don't serve
homeless?

36:01.137 --> 36:02.037
Serve everybody.

36:02.136 --> 36:04.203
Homeless, poor folks,
workin' people

36:04.303 --> 36:05.936
tryin' to make it
to a paycheck.

36:06.038 --> 36:08.671
Shit, half the neighborhood be
up here week before check day.

36:08.770 --> 36:12.503
Hey, uh, you're not--

36:12.670 --> 36:14.437
Homeless?

36:14.605 --> 36:16.339
No, I'm down in
my sister's basement,

36:16.436 --> 36:18.604
over at edmondson village.

36:18.704 --> 36:22.337
What you need
the homeless to say?

36:22.438 --> 36:24.172
Talk about the killings.

36:24.239 --> 36:26.606
The thing going on
with the serial killer.

36:26.705 --> 36:28.505
But mostly, I'm just
lookin' for a story

36:28.606 --> 36:29.939
about what it's like
for them.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.341
What life is like.

36:32.438 --> 36:33.873
Hard times out here.

36:33.973 --> 36:35.773
I can't imagine.

36:35.874 --> 36:40.073
- You gonna write a story
about what life's like, huh?

36:41.307 --> 36:43.607
Bubbles, man.

36:43.707 --> 36:45.174
Michael fletcher.

36:45.273 --> 36:48.607
- Sticking for the moment with
the west Baltimore hoops charity,

36:48.740 --> 36:51.174
what were your basic
responsibilities there?

36:51.274 --> 36:52.808
I can't rightly say.

36:52.976 --> 36:57.375
- Yet, you Drew $40,000 a year
as the executive direcr.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.541
nah.

36:58.639 --> 37:00.806
All at money went straight
back to senator Davis.

37:00.909 --> 37:03.542
- Ah!
None for you?

37:03.644 --> 37:05.711
- I got paid through the
district office for drivin' him.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.275
That money I kept.

37:07.375 --> 37:08.810
An' whenever I would
go out to snatch some money

37:08.909 --> 37:10.276
- for the senator--
- Objection.

37:10.342 --> 37:11.373
- Sometimes
kick me back a few.

37:11.507 --> 37:12.808
- Move to strike
all of that.

37:12.977 --> 37:13.810
Sustained.

37:13.909 --> 37:15.543
Disregard
that last comment.

37:15.642 --> 37:18.575
This case is limited to
the charges stemming from

37:18.676 --> 37:21.444
the operation of senator Davis'
non-profit charities.

37:21.542 --> 37:25.277
Other matters
are not relevant.

37:27.310 --> 37:29.177
Here it is.

37:40.911 --> 37:45.444
- What the hell is that--
A meet at five-fifty?

37:45.543 --> 37:47.277
I'm gonna go
get up on monk.

37:47.378 --> 37:48.945
Hmm-hmm.

37:51.112 --> 37:53.578
- You have a criminal history;
do you not, Mr. Price?

37:53.679 --> 37:55.679
Yeah, I did some years.

37:55.779 --> 37:59.047
- And when you last
got out of prison six years ago,

37:59.145 --> 38:02.778
was setor Davis aware
of your criminal record?

38:02.880 --> 38:04.512
Yes, sir.

38:04.645 --> 38:06.247
- And yet,
he gave you a job,

38:06.378 --> 38:10.280
but today, is this how
you repay him?

38:10.412 --> 38:13.513
The testimony you gave
about returning the money

38:13.580 --> 38:15.414
you earned
at the senator's charities,

38:15.514 --> 38:19.049
you say you repaid it
to the senator in cash, correct?

38:19.147 --> 38:20.579
Every time.

38:20.681 --> 38:24.717
- So there's no proof that the
senator ever received that money,

38:24.814 --> 38:25.882
isn't that correct?

38:25.981 --> 38:27.182
I guess not.

38:27.316 --> 38:28.183
You guess not.

38:28.315 --> 38:31.449
I guess not.

38:31.581 --> 38:33.315
- Mr. Price,
you acknowledged earlier

38:33.449 --> 38:35.983
that in exchange
for your testimony,

38:36.082 --> 38:39.048
you received immunity
from prosecution

38:39.147 --> 38:42.349
for any charges
related to this case.

38:42.451 --> 38:46.352
Is it fair to say that
testifying against senator Davis

38:46.449 --> 38:51.084
ensures that you will not
yourself go to jail?

38:51.217 --> 38:52.416
Got-damn right.

38:52.516 --> 38:53.516
Mr. Price.

38:53.617 --> 38:54.984
- I'm sorr--
Oh shit, sorry--

38:55.085 --> 38:55.984
Mr. Price.

38:56.151 --> 38:58.185
- Okay, my b, judge.
Sorry.

38:58.286 --> 39:00.452
- Mr. Price,
do you expect this jury

39:00.617 --> 39:03.551
to take the word
of a twice-convicted felon

39:03.651 --> 39:08.286
over the word of a duly elected
member of the Maryland state senate?

39:08.452 --> 39:09.919
What can I say?

39:10.018 --> 39:14.384
Y'all can play it like
you feel an' leave me be.

39:38.287 --> 39:39.187
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:39.287 --> 39:40.486
I don't get it.

39:40.588 --> 39:43.587
He hasn't moved off this spot
for an hour and a half.

39:43.721 --> 39:48.288
- Alright, well, come
on back then, alright?

39:48.387 --> 39:49.754
- Guy's been hitting
the bus shelters

39:49.855 --> 39:51.556
every third
or fourth night.

39:51.654 --> 39:53.121
We got two wounded
and one dead

39:53.221 --> 39:55.487
going back to that piece
since december.

39:55.656 --> 39:57.123
All I'm asking
is for hours

39:57.221 --> 39:59.355
to stake this asshole out.

39:59.455 --> 40:01.388
Guy's like clockwork.

40:01.556 --> 40:02.555
Spot me an' garvey,

40:02.655 --> 40:06.856
three nights
and the case is fuckin' down.

40:06.956 --> 40:08.490
- I can give you
two nights.

40:08.589 --> 40:09.488
- If he hits
on the third?

40:09.588 --> 40:10.488
One night.

40:10.589 --> 40:11.790
Okay, okay.

40:11.922 --> 40:13.055
Two nights.

40:13.223 --> 40:15.656
- You need to put
my c.c. Number on the ot slips

40:15.757 --> 40:16.958
and you give those to Jay--

40:17.057 --> 40:20.290
- It's cool.
I know the drill.

40:20.390 --> 40:21.691
You do?

40:21.858 --> 40:23.491
- You're doing good here,
boss--

40:23.590 --> 40:27.424
What did you just call me?

40:27.524 --> 40:29.226
What the hell is that?

40:29.323 --> 40:30.690
Office reports.

40:30.789 --> 40:33.292
Families of your victims,
debriefed in full.

40:33.391 --> 40:35.857
And believe me,
it ruined my week.

40:35.958 --> 40:37.524
Rough, huh?

40:37.625 --> 40:39.425
- I'm sittin' there explaining
to the salt of the fuckin' earth

40:39.524 --> 40:41.458
why their eldest,
who is living on the street

40:41.527 --> 40:43.995
because nothing they did
could fix his problems,

40:44.159 --> 40:45.627
but God knows they tried--

40:45.792 --> 40:49.526
Why he met his end being bit on and
fucked with by some sick motherfucker

40:49.626 --> 40:52.793
who used him
for jerk-off purposes.

40:52.892 --> 40:54.093
How the shit
about the bite marks

40:54.227 --> 40:57.161
get in the papers
in the first place?

40:57.260 --> 40:58.426
Gotta run.

40:58.525 --> 41:00.593
I got shit to assemble.

41:00.693 --> 41:03.526
You didn't tell me that part
of it, did you, motherfucker?

41:03.628 --> 41:04.627
Who's up next?

41:04.727 --> 41:08.426
I got one at the corner
of calhoun and mosher.

41:23.263 --> 41:27.394
- Jesus--
That poor guy.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.897
- Wanna take him home
with you?

41:29.997 --> 41:32.299
Shit.
Take me.

41:32.363 --> 41:33.296
What?

41:33.363 --> 41:36.930
- I'm just having fun
with you, man.

41:37.030 --> 41:42.665
- Thanks for bringing me here,
man, showing me around.

41:45.697 --> 41:48.231
nah.

41:48.331 --> 41:49.964
Not about that.

41:50.098 --> 41:51.764
Sure?

41:51.864 --> 42:00.499
- Just--
Write it like it feels.

42:09.566 --> 42:11.400
Fuck.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.867
Shit!

42:41.069 --> 42:43.702
- Rodney, you can't press
a regular for his whole tab.

42:43.802 --> 42:45.069
It just isn't done.

42:45.169 --> 42:46.569
I used to run a bar.

42:46.668 --> 42:48.668
I know how these things work,
remember?

42:48.801 --> 42:50.501
- Gus haynes,
in the flesh.

42:50.600 --> 42:51.902
Well, more of it maybe.

42:52.002 --> 42:53.201
How the hell you been?

42:53.370 --> 42:54.635
Where you been hidin'?
You in vice still?

42:54.737 --> 42:56.803
- Vice? Shit,
that does take me back.

42:56.904 --> 42:58.637
I did eight years
in homicide, brother.

42:58.802 --> 43:01.070
Now it's the western.

43:01.169 --> 43:02.802
Speaking of hiding out,
when you stop comin' round?

43:02.904 --> 43:04.371
Last I saw you was--

43:04.470 --> 43:06.804
- Well, I'm not running
the districts anymore.

43:06.969 --> 43:07.802
I'm an editor now, so--

43:07.971 --> 43:12.104
- Then you can afford
to buy a round.

43:12.239 --> 43:14.739
Hey, Dennis.

43:14.804 --> 43:16.739
Let me pull your coat.

43:16.801 --> 43:18.602
Long time, Gus.

43:18.738 --> 43:20.738
Don't tell me you knew
I'd be here tonight.

43:20.804 --> 43:22.738
- It's a cop bar, you know,
so, if it's not you,

43:22.872 --> 43:25.206
it's some other face
from back in the day.

43:25.306 --> 43:27.206
Theoretical question.

43:27.304 --> 43:28.536
Oh, theoretical.

43:28.639 --> 43:30.772
In that case, a double, rodney,
Gus is buyin'.

43:30.906 --> 43:32.306
Two, rodney.

43:32.405 --> 43:34.639
So...

43:44.672 --> 43:47.207
What?

43:47.306 --> 43:52.740
- I seen you
at the stash house, yo.

43:52.841 --> 43:55.475
Ain't you used to be
with them Barksdale boys?

43:55.573 --> 43:57.174
What they call you, yo?

43:57.276 --> 44:02.041
Savino.

44:02.210 --> 44:05.043
- That's right.
Savino.

44:05.141 --> 44:06.974
You ain't never
moved no dope.

44:07.109 --> 44:09.975
You was always muscle
as I recall.

44:10.042 --> 44:12.775
Now you musclin'
for Marlo, huh?

44:12.942 --> 44:14.743
I wasn't there.

44:14.842 --> 44:18.309
When they did the old man
like that, I wasn't there.

44:18.375 --> 44:21.042
Chris an' Snoop,
they on that.

44:21.142 --> 44:23.009
- Oh, I know
who was there.

44:23.110 --> 44:26.410
So you innocent, huh?

44:26.509 --> 44:28.211
Let me ask you
somethin' though.

44:28.311 --> 44:29.878
Bein' that youuscle
for Marlo,

44:30.011 --> 44:33.345
what you was gonna do
if you was there, huh?

44:33.444 --> 44:35.810
Riddle me that.

44:38.176 --> 44:39.977
Yeah.

44:44.344 --> 44:46.544
You know what, yo?

44:55.512 --> 44:56.946
Ready?

44:57.046 --> 44:58.812
Yeah.

44:58.878 --> 45:00.880
A-ight.

45:05.713 --> 45:06.915
Yeah?

45:07.013 --> 45:09.113
We got to talk.

45:09.245 --> 45:10.379
I'll come over to you.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.914
hmm.

45:14.915 --> 45:16.548
Does that seem possible?

45:16.647 --> 45:19.282
To go through the court system
with a false I.D.?

45:19.381 --> 45:22.181
- Maybe the first time,
if she's got no priors,

45:22.283 --> 45:25.549
no prints on file,
but after that?

45:25.649 --> 45:28.448
B.p.I. Sheets have
fingerprint characteristics

45:28.549 --> 45:30.983
that are like
an F.B.I. Bar code.

45:31.082 --> 45:32.749
And it's paired
with a photo.

45:32.882 --> 45:33.916
A name's one thing.

45:34.015 --> 45:35.882
But unless
hese women
are twin sisters

45:36.016 --> 45:37.750
and one's been carrying
the other one's hand around

45:37.916 --> 45:40.116
in her purse
for the last twelve years--

45:40.216 --> 45:45.116
Somebody's
yanking your chain.

45:45.216 --> 45:46.916
It's definitely a code.

45:47.016 --> 45:49.483
Definitely not having
much to do with time.

45:49.584 --> 45:51.851
We're at a point where
I'm going to need more bodies,

45:51.950 --> 45:54.118
surveillance cars,
man hours.

45:54.217 --> 45:55.650
We're gonna have to stay
on these guys

45:55.751 --> 45:57.952
until those clocks
start to make sense.

45:58.051 --> 46:00.918
- Well, good news is they giving
me more manpower than I can waste.

46:01.017 --> 46:02.285
Bad news?

46:02.386 --> 46:03.952
- It's all around the office
that I'm giving out hours

46:04.119 --> 46:08.186
and money to people
to work other cases.

46:08.319 --> 46:09.185
I can't help it, Lester.

46:09.286 --> 46:10.220
It's the kind of person
I am.

46:10.317 --> 46:11.385
I give and give and give--

46:11.516 --> 46:12.684
- You know,
if you're not careful,

46:12.784 --> 46:14.984
you're gonna get shit on you,
on us.

46:15.119 --> 46:16.319
Who's gonna complain?

46:16.418 --> 46:21.052
Guys are working cases
and getting paid--

46:21.152 --> 46:23.686
So what exactly
do you need?

46:23.785 --> 46:24.953
Seven men.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.420
No, eight.
And cars.

46:27.518 --> 46:30.686
- Oh shit, they offered me men
from the districts,

46:30.786 --> 46:33.687
and a surveillance supervisor
to run the detail.

46:33.788 --> 46:35.221
- Anyone in the districts
we trust?

46:35.322 --> 46:37.754
- Hmm.
Lemme think on that.

46:40.486 --> 46:41.954
Yeah?

46:42.054 --> 46:45.721
- I don't know how the fuck did
you of all people do this shit, huh?

46:45.821 --> 46:46.821
how?

46:46.921 --> 46:48.620
- You got the right
allen wrench?

46:48.720 --> 46:49.986
God damn directions.

46:50.088 --> 46:53.421
- What kind of scotch
you using?

46:59.956 --> 47:01.089
ow!

47:01.188 --> 47:02.356
Fuck!

47:02.455 --> 47:04.622
Fuck! Fuck!

47:04.721 --> 47:05.788
Piece of shit!

47:05.888 --> 47:08.521
- Yo, so you talked
to Chris, right?

47:08.622 --> 47:10.156
What he say?

47:10.324 --> 47:11.723
He didn't say shit.

47:11.823 --> 47:14.257
He knows I ain't say
a fuckin' word to no police.

47:14.356 --> 47:17.523
- And you heard what little
dermell said to the juvenile master?

47:17.624 --> 47:20.558
Lady ax him like,
"yo, you got a record?"

47:20.657 --> 47:22.025
he's like "yeah, bitch,
I got a record.

47:22.124 --> 47:26.925
My record's so long
I'm about to put out an album."

47:27.025 --> 47:31.659
- Uh uh uh, don't touch
that dial, young'un.

47:37.026 --> 47:39.659
This a Stanfield
corner, huh?

47:39.757 --> 47:42.622
huh?

47:42.725 --> 47:44.926
You know who I am?

47:51.825 --> 47:53.760
You make sure
you tell the boss man

47:53.860 --> 47:56.927
that you know who it is
dropped savino last night.

47:57.028 --> 47:58.961
Ya feel me?

47:59.062 --> 48:01.761
You tell that man
I'ma drop all his muscle

48:01.859 --> 48:08.128
until he get the heart to come
down to the street and dance.

48:08.227 --> 48:11.928
You gonna remone that,
sweetpea?

48:25.596 --> 48:27.796
- That's Omar?
Damn.

48:27.896 --> 48:31.863
Savino dead, yo?

48:31.962 --> 48:37.061
- Shit, man, if he'DA made me from
monk's apartment the other night,

48:37.163 --> 48:39.897
I might be laid out
my own self.

48:39.963 --> 48:44.765
Gimpy as a motherfucker.

48:44.864 --> 48:46.398
- I don't know, senator.
I want to believe you.

48:46.498 --> 48:48.033
I mean,
I'm your lawyer.

48:48.162 --> 48:49.895
But there's all this
up on the board

48:50.032 --> 48:52.797
that Mr. Bond
has on display--

48:52.965 --> 48:55.265
$11,000
to west side hoops,

48:55.399 --> 48:58.032
next day,
$11,000 drawn,

48:58.131 --> 49:02.730
then $11,000 deposited in
your personal banking account--

49:02.832 --> 49:04.632
- You bet
it all went into my account.

49:04.731 --> 49:06.998
It made it easier
for me to do my job.

49:07.098 --> 49:08.464
And at the end of the day?

49:08.563 --> 49:09.997
Not one penny
stayed with me.

49:10.166 --> 49:12.366
- I need you to do better
than that, senator.

49:12.532 --> 49:13.366
Where are your records?

49:13.467 --> 49:14.368
Records?

49:14.464 --> 49:15.699
Yes, records.

49:15.800 --> 49:18.434
For example,
this check for $11,000

49:18.532 --> 49:20.367
dated january 22nd--

49:20.466 --> 49:22.534
That was last winter, right?

49:22.633 --> 49:27.101
So, some went to pay
everyone's b.g.E.,

49:27.167 --> 49:29.900
'cause half my district was
gonna have the heat turned off,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.302
and then, some went
for puff jackets for them

49:32.402 --> 49:33.935
that got children in need.

49:34.034 --> 49:35.901
Let me tell you
something, man.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.935
My neck of the woods,
it's a jungle out there.

49:39.034 --> 49:44.134
Everybody living hand to mouth,
improvising, hustlin',

49:44.270 --> 49:46.737
make do with as little
as you can imagine.

49:46.834 --> 49:50.735
Hell, that, uh, that TV show,
what's that, "survivor"?

49:50.836 --> 49:52.470
Man, they want
some good contestants,

49:52.635 --> 49:54.569
they need to come
around westside.

49:55.769 --> 49:56.835
Folks I know?

49:56.937 --> 49:58.536
Oh, we'd do great
on that show.

49:58.669 --> 50:01.468
Practice every damn day
of our lives.

50:01.634 --> 50:03.303
Hell,
and "fear factor"?

50:03.404 --> 50:06.504
Oh, sheee--
Don't even get me started.

50:06.602 --> 50:09.337
- Forgive me, but I still don't
understand how that justifies--

50:09.438 --> 50:10.704
- Let me tell you something,
brother--

50:10.837 --> 50:13.971
I don't know how they do it
out in Roland park--

50:14.071 --> 50:18.337
Maybe prosecutor obonda
can enlighten me on that.

50:18.506 --> 50:20.506
But my world is strictly
cash and carry,

50:20.605 --> 50:22.972
and I am Clay Davis.

50:23.105 --> 50:26.571
My people need something,
they know where to find me.

50:26.672 --> 50:30.239
Let me tell you, brother,
I step out the door,

50:30.339 --> 50:32.739
hit the corner of mosher
and pennsylvania,

50:32.839 --> 50:34.773
you better believe
my pockets are bulging.

50:34.873 --> 50:38.307
But by the time
I get to Robert street--

50:38.406 --> 50:40.073
Objection!

50:40.172 --> 50:43.973
Objection, your honor.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.341
- Senator! Senator,
take a seat,

50:46.440 --> 50:49.075
and refrain from off-hand
references to Mr. Bond.

50:49.173 --> 50:51.439
- My apologies,
your honor.

50:51.539 --> 50:54.975
- But these charities were
set up for basketball leagues

50:55.140 --> 50:57.041
in city rec centers,
weren't they?

50:57.140 --> 51:02.075
- Yeah, but you give me 20,000or
a basketball and an air pump,

51:02.174 --> 51:04.908
I am pullin' goodly on that
for whatever,

51:04.974 --> 51:07.075
whoever comes at me.

51:07.176 --> 51:11.176
"senator Clay,
I gots to bury my mother,

51:11.310 --> 51:13.277
"bail out my son,

51:13.377 --> 51:16.544
"buy a new shirt
for a job interview,

51:16.642 --> 51:19.010
pay my child's asthma doctor."

51:19.109 --> 51:22.542
Takes me half an hour
to go a hundred yards,

51:22.642 --> 51:26.841
and excuse me if I didn't ask
that old Arthur-itised woman

51:26.976 --> 51:28.076
for a receipt,

51:28.176 --> 51:30.743
or that young mother
needed the similac

51:30.844 --> 51:32.711
to sign
a damned piece a paper

51:32.810 --> 51:34.977
so I don't have to be up here
in this box right now

51:35.076 --> 51:38.010
explainin' to folks who never
been in our neck of the woods

51:38.111 --> 51:40.477
how things truly are.

51:40.611 --> 51:43.177
And if a jury of my peers,

51:43.279 --> 51:48.214
you all deem it right and true
for me to walk out of here

51:48.312 --> 51:51.211
an upright
and justified man?

51:51.313 --> 51:53.379
Oh, I ain't
gonna lie to you.

51:53.477 --> 51:55.778
I'ma gonna do
the same damn thing tomorrow,

51:55.844 --> 51:58.313
and the day after that
and the day after that,

51:58.412 --> 52:01.478
until they got me laid out
at march's funeral home,

52:01.579 --> 52:04.416
and truck me off
to mt. Auburn.

52:09.112 --> 52:10.746
Silence.

52:10.914 --> 52:12.315
Silence in this courtroom.

52:12.413 --> 52:13.646
What about trailers?

52:13.747 --> 52:14.947
Like fema.

52:15.049 --> 52:17.215
We set up trailers to act as
temp housing for some of the--

52:17.314 --> 52:18.847
Some of the shelter
popution.

52:18.980 --> 52:21.513
You know, put 'em down
in war memorial plaza.

52:21.614 --> 52:23.781
- Do you know how much
fema pays per trailer?

52:23.948 --> 52:25.349
- A dozen trailers
for the homeless.

52:25.514 --> 52:28.249
We've got three to four thousand
on the streets, at least.

52:28.350 --> 52:29.249
It's symbolic.

52:29.347 --> 52:30.348
You know, we're doing
what we can

52:30.415 --> 52:32.948
with a civic disaster--
Like new orleans--

52:33.048 --> 52:34.149
Abandoned by the state,

52:34.248 --> 52:36.115
ignored by the federal
government.

52:36.215 --> 52:39.683
- It's bad enough you want to
keep the city shelters open 24/7.

52:39.782 --> 52:40.950
That puts
the health department

52:41.050 --> 52:43.217
a couple hundred thousand
in the red.

52:43.316 --> 52:44.849
You add that to the overage
we're gonna see

52:44.949 --> 52:46.383
for letting
the police department run wild

52:46.481 --> 52:48.417
with overtime
and investigative costs--

52:48.582 --> 52:50.581
There's no choice anymore.

52:50.683 --> 52:52.883
This thing has a lock
on everyone's attention.

52:52.985 --> 52:54.651
When another victim
disappears,

52:54.816 --> 52:56.550
we're gonna be
even more on the spot.

52:56.648 --> 52:59.449
- I'm just telling you, if
this goes on more than a month,

52:59.550 --> 53:01.083
with what we'll be spending,

53:01.250 --> 53:02.716
you're looking at cutbacks
throughout the agencies;

53:02.818 --> 53:06.153
maybe even teacher layoffs
come the end of the fiscal.

53:06.253 --> 53:08.918
- Teacher layoffs...
- By a gubernatorial candidate...

53:09.052 --> 53:10.285
In an election year.

53:10.450 --> 53:13.617
Lovely.

53:21.184 --> 53:22.818
- Hold up, hold up,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

53:22.885 --> 53:25.850
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:25.986 --> 53:27.119
I just want to say

53:27.219 --> 53:31.119
that despite all the false
accusations made against me,

53:31.286 --> 53:35.087
the people who I continue
to serve have spoken.

53:35.186 --> 53:37.721
What the fuck just happened?

53:37.853 --> 53:40.820
- ...as long as I can
to serve the people.

53:40.920 --> 53:44.721
- Whatever it was, they don't
teach it in law school.

53:46.919 --> 53:50.354
- 45 inches of Clay Davis
playing not just the race card,

53:50.487 --> 53:53.022
but the whole deck,
coming at ya.

53:53.121 --> 53:55.288
- Got it.
Thank ye.

53:55.388 --> 53:58.955
- Someday you're going to have
to explain all this to me, Gus.

53:59.056 --> 54:00.055
After watching that verdict
come in,

54:00.157 --> 54:02.790
I feel very white.

54:02.855 --> 54:04.855
- Well, start with some
James Brown records

54:04.956 --> 54:08.489
and work up from there.

54:13.555 --> 54:14.855
It's embarrassing,
ain't it?

54:14.955 --> 54:17.956
- I can't believe nobody had
sense enough to tone this down.

54:18.058 --> 54:19.125
The hype is bad enough.

54:19.290 --> 54:21.124
But what gets me is
that I can't trust the guy.

54:21.224 --> 54:23.590
I mean, I send him back out onto
the street to own his mistake,

54:23.691 --> 54:26.591
he comes back with some
bullshit about stolen identities.

54:26.691 --> 54:28.325
I don't give a fuck
he gets took.

54:28.425 --> 54:30.024
Everybody gets took
now and then.

54:30.125 --> 54:31.191
I know I did.

54:31.326 --> 54:33.058
- It's about
not owning up to it.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.793
- Gus, this thing with
the woman and the crab cake?

54:35.958 --> 54:37.358
You think the first time
you catch him

54:37.426 --> 54:39.059
is the first time
he does it?

54:39.158 --> 54:42.325
- Lotta guys'll try
to duck a correction.

54:42.425 --> 54:43.358
But the thing with this is,

54:43.490 --> 54:45.059
he was standing
on an outright lie.

54:45.159 --> 54:46.526
And if he'll lie
about a correction--

54:46.625 --> 54:50.491
- Then will he lie to make a
story better than it ought to be?

54:50.591 --> 54:52.327
- I keep thinking about
that kid in the wheelchair

54:52.428 --> 54:53.860
out in front
of oriole park.

54:53.993 --> 54:57.126
The one that only
had a nickname.
