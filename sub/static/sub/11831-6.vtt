12:28.166 --> 12:30.435
[ Man ]
Well, he was an okay worker.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.904
<i>Not a great journalist</i>
<i>by any means,</i>
<i>but a good guy.</i>

12:33.971 --> 12:35.906
Why did you discharge him,
Mr. Holt?

12:35.973 --> 12:38.843
He looked like a monkey.
There were...

12:38.909 --> 12:42.279
other reasons than that,
were there not, Mr. Holt?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.248
Oh. Sure.

12:44.314 --> 12:46.984
Uh, like I said, he wasn't
this great journalist--

12:47.051 --> 12:49.319
<i>And he was</i>
<i>always complaining.</i>

12:49.386 --> 12:52.222
<i>You gotta understand.</i>
The Hub <i>is a small paper.</i>

12:52.289 --> 12:55.660
<i>We need morale.</i>
<i>Harry didn't have it.</i>
<i>You didn't, Harry.</i>

12:55.726 --> 12:58.528
Mr. Holt, don't address
the plaintiff.

12:58.595 --> 13:02.499
- I've been addressin' him
for nine years, Judge.
- We don't do that in here.

13:02.566 --> 13:04.869
Well, that strikes me
as silly.

13:04.935 --> 13:06.904
People should go
face to face with problems.

13:06.971 --> 13:09.139
I went straight to him
and told him to shave his neck.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.608
- Didn't I, Harry?
- I won't ask you again, sir.

13:11.675 --> 13:16.513
Sorry.
Look, like I was saying,
we're a small paper,

13:16.580 --> 13:19.583
and everybody's gotta
pull loads for each other,

13:19.649 --> 13:21.851
even sell ad space.

13:21.918 --> 13:24.254
Fact, that may be
our biggest job.

13:24.321 --> 13:27.090
We don't sell ad space,
we don't get to sell papers.

13:27.156 --> 13:30.259
And the plaintiff wasn't
selling advertising space?

13:30.326 --> 13:32.328
<i>Who would buy</i>
<i>anything from him?</i>

13:32.395 --> 13:34.931
Hair coming out of his collar,
climbing up his neck
like a vine.

13:34.998 --> 13:37.200
He looks like a monkey.

13:37.266 --> 13:40.870
Did you leave bananas
on his desk, sir?

13:40.937 --> 13:44.207
Of course not,
and I didn't encourage it.

13:44.273 --> 13:46.375
And what he didn't
tell this court...

13:46.442 --> 13:50.914
<i>is after he'd get all hurt</i>
<i>by these bananas,</i>
<i>he'd eat them.</i>

13:50.980 --> 13:52.982
Move to strike.
That isn't relevant.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.783
He started turning into
this negative person.

13:54.850 --> 13:58.187
I can't keep hearing complaints
from somebody with a hairy neck.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.489
- Objection.
- <i>[ Judge ]</i>
<i>Sustained.</i>

14:00.556 --> 14:02.358
Why don't we take our break?

14:03.926 --> 14:05.861
You admit it?
Lindsay,
what's the big deal?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.796
The big deal.
The big deal?
Shh! Come on.

14:07.863 --> 14:10.599
You drugged me.
You slipped an illegal drug
into my wine without telling me.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.835
You then sleep with me
while I'm under
the influence.

14:12.901 --> 14:15.371
The big deal
is called rape.
[ Scoffs ]

14:15.438 --> 14:17.940
First of all,
it was such a minimal dosage.

14:18.006 --> 14:20.509
"Minimal"? You can't regulate it
with any accurate--
Second of all,

14:20.576 --> 14:23.145
I've always drugged you one way
or another and you've always
known about it...

14:23.211 --> 14:25.581
without wanting to know
about it, so let's not pretend.

14:25.648 --> 14:28.150
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

14:28.216 --> 14:30.385
Have you ever known anyone
more uptight about sex than you?

14:30.452 --> 14:33.088
- That's not the point.
- No, the point is
you liked it...

14:33.155 --> 14:35.490
when I slipped
a little something
in the brownies.

14:35.557 --> 14:38.560
- You were glad when I didn't
tell you about it--
- That went on in college,

14:38.626 --> 14:40.996
and has nothing
to do with this.
I am talking about you...

14:41.063 --> 14:44.566
being incapable of enjoying sex
without something to take away
your inhibitions.

14:44.632 --> 14:47.835
I'm talking about how
we both know you loved it more
the night of,

14:47.902 --> 14:49.737
and felt less guilty
the day after,

14:49.804 --> 14:52.407
if you could pretend
you didn't know
I was loosening you up.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.943
Wine is one thing.
Last night you slipped me
an illegal drug.

14:58.546 --> 15:03.017
Okay, the stuff
might have been stronger.
If so, I apologize.

15:03.084 --> 15:05.887
But I didn't do anything
we didn't do before,

15:05.953 --> 15:07.989
and you know that.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.359
When you described yourself
in your ad as someone...

15:12.426 --> 15:14.662
"eager to discover life
beneath the surface,"

15:14.729 --> 15:16.598
what did you mean?

15:16.664 --> 15:18.733
I think it's pretty obvious
what that means.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.569
So when we spoke on the phone
of my first marriage,
about my kids,

15:22.636 --> 15:25.873
that was you trying to discover
the life below the surface?

15:25.940 --> 15:27.875
I suppose.

15:27.942 --> 15:30.044
Do you recall telling me
you'd never felt
so comfortable...

15:30.111 --> 15:32.013
talking to a man
as you felt with me?

15:32.079 --> 15:34.115
I may have said that.

15:34.181 --> 15:38.385
And when we spoke on the phone,
didn't we mutually share
our respective hurt...

15:38.452 --> 15:41.155
at being rejected
on physical appearance alone?

15:41.222 --> 15:43.324
We talked about a lot
of stuff, George.
I don't see--

15:43.390 --> 15:46.126
And didn't we talk about that?

15:47.561 --> 15:49.596
Yes.
And yet,

15:49.663 --> 15:53.133
as soon as you saw me
you became uninterested.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.202
I just didn't think
things would work out.

15:56.269 --> 16:00.106
Why not?
Because--

16:01.174 --> 16:03.409
I just didn't think so.

16:03.476 --> 16:05.311
Why not?

16:08.214 --> 16:10.784
Asked and answered.

16:10.851 --> 16:13.286
Was it because
I'm losing my hair?

16:13.353 --> 16:15.321
Don't have the physique?
Bad skin?

16:15.388 --> 16:17.924
It's not just
physical appearance, George.

16:17.991 --> 16:20.193
It was--

16:20.260 --> 16:23.029
I don't know.
It was demeanor as well.

16:23.096 --> 16:26.599
"Demeanor."
What was my demeanor?

16:29.369 --> 16:31.471
A demeanor that didn't
attract me.

16:31.537 --> 16:33.406
That's all I can say.

16:33.473 --> 16:35.508
One of the things
that attracted me to you...

16:35.575 --> 16:37.743
was your incredible ability
to articulate...

16:37.810 --> 16:40.145
what you think and feel.

16:40.212 --> 16:42.682
So what was it
about my demeanor?

16:44.817 --> 16:47.186
You struck me as--

16:48.253 --> 16:50.322
as kind of a loser.

16:52.091 --> 16:54.259
"A loser"?

16:54.326 --> 16:57.462
<i>All that</i>
<i>self-deprecating charm</i>
<i>on the phone--</i>

16:57.529 --> 17:00.532
In person, it just
wasn't that charming.

17:00.599 --> 17:03.268
It was immediately sad,

17:03.335 --> 17:05.503
even a little pathetic.

17:08.607 --> 17:10.909
And you think--

17:10.976 --> 17:13.178
And you think
that you deserved better?

17:13.244 --> 17:15.946
I never said that.

17:16.013 --> 17:18.883
Well, why don't you say it?

17:18.950 --> 17:20.919
Please.

17:20.984 --> 17:24.522
Okay.
I wanted more.

17:24.589 --> 17:27.224
I didn't wanna
play the fat girl
by the punch bowl...

17:27.290 --> 17:29.628
who leaves with the nerd.

17:29.694 --> 17:32.030
I wanted more than that.

17:32.096 --> 17:34.132
I'm sorry.

17:38.469 --> 17:40.839
It seems we have two options.

17:40.905 --> 17:43.274
- Reopen the case--
- <i>[ Pratt ]</i>
<i>It won't help.</i>

17:43.341 --> 17:46.077
Look, we always knew
she couldn't have
done it alone.

17:46.144 --> 17:49.780
<i>We had two theories:</i>
<i>Either he did it,</i>
<i>or they did it together.</i>

17:49.848 --> 17:52.984
We were kind of hoping
if he had acted solo, she would
have turned state's evidence.

17:53.051 --> 17:56.420
<i>I still think</i>
<i>they did it together.</i>
They didn't.

17:56.487 --> 17:58.456
- Can you prove that?
- We could stipulate
to the polygraph.

17:58.522 --> 18:01.225
- Oh, right.
- Keith, I got
nothin' vested here.

18:01.292 --> 18:04.395
My guy's free.
She wasn't in on it.

18:04.462 --> 18:07.598
- The jury says she was.
- Come on.
What are we doin' here?

18:09.767 --> 18:12.135
Okay.

18:12.202 --> 18:15.072
Look, I'll consider--
And I mean consider here.

18:15.138 --> 18:18.008
<i>We can bring federal</i>
<i>criminal claims,</i>
<i>plus perjury.</i>

18:18.075 --> 18:20.410
<i>He agrees to plead</i>
<i>guilty to both.</i>

18:20.478 --> 18:23.080
No double jeopardy
challenges from you.
Thirty years.

18:23.146 --> 18:25.616
He won't do that.
He's not goin' to jail.

18:25.683 --> 18:27.217
Then we have nothing
to talk about, Bobby.

18:27.284 --> 18:29.186
<i>I'm not letting</i>
<i>them both go free.</i>

18:29.252 --> 18:32.823
This is a solved
and closed case, and I'm
very happy to keep it that way.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.827
Your Honor?

18:38.795 --> 18:41.731
I'm afraid I have to agree
with the district attorney here.

18:41.798 --> 18:45.302
<i>Without new</i>
<i>and conclusively</i>
<i>exculpatory evidence,</i>

18:45.368 --> 18:47.504
there are no grounds
to reopen.

18:47.570 --> 18:51.007
- <i>Her conviction has to stand.</i>
- We do nothing then?

18:51.074 --> 18:53.310
We proceed to sentencing.

18:55.878 --> 18:59.516
Mr. Holt, you think it's okay
to fire somebody just 'cause
of the way they look?

18:59.582 --> 19:03.185
- I do.
- Looks alone, period?

19:03.252 --> 19:06.423
I wouldn't fire somebody because
of the color of their skin,
if that's what you're thinking.

19:06.489 --> 19:09.592
But for looking
like a monkey?
Absolutely.

19:09.659 --> 19:12.161
One can't be
a successful film critic
if he's not attractive?

19:12.228 --> 19:15.031
What about Gene Shalit?

19:15.097 --> 19:18.600
[ Laughs ]
I knew he'd say that.

19:18.668 --> 19:21.603
Gene Shalit is an exception.
He's always saying
insipid things.

19:21.670 --> 19:24.140
What comes out of his mouth
goes with looking
like a monkey.

19:24.206 --> 19:28.710
Isn't it true, sir,
you fired another employee
for being too fat?

19:28.777 --> 19:31.813
Sandra Boyd.
I don't have a problem
with fat.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.084
But with Sandra--
She wore sleeveless dresses,

19:35.151 --> 19:37.386
so whenever she would
reach up or wave,

19:37.453 --> 19:39.455
this part would wiggle
for a full minute.

19:39.521 --> 19:42.858
- <i>I found it distracting.</i>
- And Wayne Keppler?

19:42.924 --> 19:45.394
- Midget. I'm afraid of 'em.
- You're scared of midgets?

19:45.461 --> 19:48.497
<i>I'm not proud of it,</i>
<i>but for whatever reason,</i>
<i>I get nervous around 'em.</i>

19:49.731 --> 19:53.602
You also fired Kim Orent
for having doughnut breath.

19:53.669 --> 19:55.937
I tried a diet.
She comes in
smelling like crullers.

19:56.004 --> 19:57.906
It's bad for my discipline.

19:57.973 --> 20:00.141
I can't tell whether
I'm winning or losing here.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.611
Look. There's a reason
for all this.

20:02.678 --> 20:06.782
- What's that, sir?
- It's my paper.

20:06.848 --> 20:10.852
<i>One of the reasons</i>
<i>I hustled up investors</i>
<i>to start my own company...</i>

20:10.919 --> 20:12.888
<i>is so it could be mine--</i>

20:12.954 --> 20:15.824
so I could choose the people
I wanted to be around.

20:15.891 --> 20:19.227
I could have gone to work
someplace else and gone
by other people's rules,

20:19.294 --> 20:21.329
but I didn't want that.

20:21.396 --> 20:24.365
So I walked the plank
and started my own business.

20:24.432 --> 20:27.935
And now you're trying
to tell me who I gotta hire
and who I can't fire?

20:28.002 --> 20:30.905
No, I'm trying to say
you can't discriminate
against people...

20:30.971 --> 20:32.907
on account of looks alone.

20:32.973 --> 20:36.577
Oh, please.
That kind of discrimination
goes on all the time.

20:36.644 --> 20:38.846
The only difference here is,
I admit it.

20:38.913 --> 20:42.383
Harry is a negative guy
who looks like an ape,

20:42.450 --> 20:44.485
<i>and I don't want him</i>
<i>working for my company.</i>

20:44.552 --> 20:49.156
There's a juror over there--
I won't say which one--
who looks like a possum.

20:49.223 --> 20:51.358
I wouldn't hire him either.

20:51.425 --> 20:54.995
I'm terribly sorry,
but I really think
it's time for another break.

20:57.597 --> 20:59.633
So what are you
going to do?

20:59.699 --> 21:01.701
What can I do?
File charges?

21:04.704 --> 21:07.641
Does this drug
knock you out?
It could, but it didn't.

21:07.707 --> 21:11.945
It just kind of made me giddy,
and incredibly--

21:12.012 --> 21:13.947
Horny?

21:14.013 --> 21:16.483
Yeah.

21:17.617 --> 21:20.053
Lindsay, how do you
go about proving...

21:20.119 --> 21:21.855
that you wouldn't
have consented?

21:21.921 --> 21:23.823
I mean, you have
with this guy before.

21:23.890 --> 21:26.793
There were rumors
flying around about scratches
on the conference table.

21:26.860 --> 21:28.862
But I know I wouldn't have
this time.

21:28.928 --> 21:30.964
I regretted having
to Lemon Pledge
the conference table.

21:31.030 --> 21:34.167
Trust me. I'd made up my mind
never to be anything
but platonic with him again.

21:34.233 --> 21:37.937
Then why'd you go out
with him, drink wine and--
Rebecca.

21:38.004 --> 21:41.841
Wait. I'm just asking questions
that are definitely
going to get asked.

21:41.908 --> 21:44.110
There are rape shield laws
in Massachusetts.
They can't attack me.

21:44.177 --> 21:47.246
Lindsay, this morning,
over the toilet bowl,
you told me you enjoyed it.

21:47.313 --> 21:50.416
Yeah, but it was only
because of the drug.

21:50.483 --> 21:53.887
I know myself, Rebecca.
I'm not capable of good sex.

21:58.291 --> 22:00.759
Did you tell him
how good it was?

22:05.798 --> 22:07.633
Maybe.

22:11.069 --> 22:14.840
- You told the D.A.?
- Gentlemen's agreement.
It stays sealed.

22:14.907 --> 22:17.743
Maybe I should just
come out in public.

22:17.810 --> 22:21.647
Wouldn't that put
some political pressure
on them to let her go?

22:21.714 --> 22:23.949
You don't rank too high
in the credibility polls
right now.

22:24.016 --> 22:25.851
You lied on the stand.

22:25.918 --> 22:28.520
<i>They'll just think</i>
<i>you're lying now.</i>

22:28.586 --> 22:30.889
The polygraph
is inadmissible.

22:30.956 --> 22:33.458
Why would I say I did it?
What would be my motive?

22:33.525 --> 22:37.162
To free your girlfriend,
to get the money--

22:37.229 --> 22:39.131
which right now,
you don't get.

22:39.197 --> 22:43.668
If Mary Jane is cleared,
she suddenly qualifies
for the insurance proceeds...

22:43.735 --> 22:46.371
and the inheritance,
which is millions
of dollars--

22:46.438 --> 22:48.473
Money you get to play with
if you stay together.

22:48.540 --> 22:51.709
You think she'd stay with me
after learning what I did?

22:51.776 --> 22:53.778
Look, you can do
whatever you choose to do.

22:53.845 --> 22:56.881
As your lawyer, let me
give you this piece
of legal advice.

22:56.948 --> 23:00.652
A public confession
does not help Mary Jane.

23:00.718 --> 23:04.088
I do think it exposes you
to federal criminal claims,

23:04.155 --> 23:06.023
as well as perjury.

23:06.090 --> 23:08.426
She'd still
be goin' to jail,
and so would you.

[ Knocking ]

23:11.896 --> 23:14.465
Hi, Andrea.
Hi.

23:14.531 --> 23:16.868
What's goin' on?

23:16.934 --> 23:19.636
What do you mean?

23:19.704 --> 23:24.375
There's rumors
of ex parte meetings--
you, Pratt, the judge.

23:24.441 --> 23:26.844
What's goin' on?

23:28.512 --> 23:31.082
I, uh--
I went to Judge Hiller...

23:31.148 --> 23:34.518
and told her how
I really did ambush you
at the trial,

23:34.585 --> 23:36.487
<i>and that she and Pratt</i>
<i>should consider...</i>

23:36.553 --> 23:39.523
giving Mary Jane
a new trial, but...

23:39.590 --> 23:41.625
they refused.

23:41.692 --> 23:44.528
Why didn't you bring me
in on this?

23:44.595 --> 23:47.298
Anything you said
would have been self-serving.

23:47.364 --> 23:49.466
I thought I could be
more persuasive alone.

23:49.533 --> 23:53.637
<i>Andrea,</i>
<i>does Mary Jane--</i>

23:54.605 --> 23:56.707
Does-Does she think
I turned on her?

23:56.773 --> 23:59.876
No. She knows it was him.

24:09.853 --> 24:12.989
I think it's goin' well,
but--
But what?

24:13.056 --> 24:15.191
Well, even though he was
saying what I wanted,

24:15.258 --> 24:18.228
I couldn't tell
if I was gettin' him
or he was gettin' me.

24:18.294 --> 24:20.530
It was a paradox.

24:20.596 --> 24:23.933
Wh-What's next?
Well, Harry's been recalled,
and he takes the stand again.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.070
You want me there?
No. I can do this.
It's okay.

24:27.137 --> 24:29.839
Jimmy, this case
should be kind of
a slam dunk, you know.

24:29.905 --> 24:32.542
I'm doin' fine, Bobby.
Okay.

24:32.608 --> 24:34.810
Mr. Papp, you weren't
a negative person?

24:34.877 --> 24:37.647
I had my gripes,
like everybody else,

24:37.713 --> 24:40.149
but it's not like
I walked around
oozing pessimism.

24:40.215 --> 24:44.186
And how would you describe
your journalistic skills?
I'd describe them as good.

24:44.253 --> 24:46.489
And did the other reporters
at <i>The Hub</i> appreciate
your skills?

24:46.556 --> 24:50.560
Look, everybody knows
the discrimination that goes on
against the film critic.

24:50.626 --> 24:52.828
Why don't you fill us in
on that, Mr. Papp?

24:52.895 --> 24:54.964
<i>They don't think</i>
<i>we're real journalists.</i>

24:55.030 --> 24:56.799
They're jealous 'cause we get
to interview celebrities.

24:56.866 --> 25:01.303
In fact, the other reporters
at your paper object to you
even being called a journalist.

25:01.370 --> 25:03.272
Isn't that right?
So what?

25:03.338 --> 25:07.076
You think Tom Brokaw invites
Janet Maslin to his parties,
or Gene Siskel?

25:07.142 --> 25:10.845
<i>They're all</i>
<i>considered jokes.</i>
<i>This doesn't bother us.</i>

25:10.912 --> 25:12.814
We know in our hearts
if we weren't there,

25:12.881 --> 25:15.950
the general public wouldn't
be able to decide whether
they like the movie or not.

25:16.017 --> 25:18.253
Oh, but it does
bother you, Mr. Papp...

25:18.320 --> 25:21.290
to know that your kind of work
isn't really respected
by your peers.

25:21.356 --> 25:24.259
- I don't see the relevance
in this.
- I am trying to show...

25:24.326 --> 25:28.029
that this is an embittered man
who only finds gratification
in attacking others.

25:28.096 --> 25:30.932
That is why he is
attacking my client today.

25:30.999 --> 25:32.634
He fired me
for looking like a monkey.

25:32.701 --> 25:34.268
For looking like
a brooding monkey...

25:34.335 --> 25:36.437
who was casting a negative pall
over the entire office.

25:36.505 --> 25:38.172

- I'll say it now.

for other jobs, Mr. Papp?

25:46.748 --> 25:49.818
I will.
It's too painful
right now.

25:49.884 --> 25:51.986
Hmm. Prior to your discharge,

25:52.053 --> 25:54.788
didn't my client repeatedly
ask you to shave the hair
on your neck,

25:54.855 --> 25:57.291
and to trim the fuzz
coming out of your ears?

25:57.358 --> 26:00.828
I did sometimes, but he wasn't
giving grooming tips
to the other reporters.

26:00.894 --> 26:05.599
<i>You were too lazy to comply</i>
<i>with these requests.</i>
<i>Isn't that the truth?</i>

26:05.666 --> 26:07.968
Objection.
That's a legal conclusion.

26:08.035 --> 26:10.571
No, it isn't,
but I'll sustain
the objection anyway.

26:10.638 --> 26:12.540
Well, on what grounds?

26:12.606 --> 26:15.008
I just ruled
in your favor, counsel.

I have here the last review
prior to your discharge.

26:19.580 --> 26:23.216

The Island of Dr. Moreau.
Did you write this review?

26:23.283 --> 26:26.754

26:31.324 --> 26:33.626
"It stinks."

26:33.694 --> 26:36.930
Would you consider that
a lazy review?

26:38.498 --> 26:42.002
I would consider that succinct.

26:42.069 --> 26:44.304
You wanna repeat that?
<i>You heard me, Chris.</i>

26:44.371 --> 26:47.107
Resign from the D.A.'s office,
or I file charges.

Whatever drug
you're on now, Lindsay,

26:49.776 --> 26:52.145
If this file
came across your desk,
you'd prosecute.

26:52.212 --> 26:55.047
Maybe I exercised poor judgment.
"Poor judgment"?
Is that what you call it?

26:55.114 --> 26:57.484
The sex was consensual.
I didn't have the capacity
to give consent.

26:57.550 --> 26:59.786
I was under the influence.
You had capacity.
You initiated it.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.054
Because of the drug.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.492
Lindsay, think about this.

27:05.558 --> 27:07.359
I have thought
about it all night,

27:07.427 --> 27:10.062
and I can't live
with letting you
get away with it.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.701
I will not resign my job,

27:14.767 --> 27:17.369

I'll fight,

27:17.436 --> 27:19.305

27:19.371 --> 27:22.408
I don't want to ruin

I'll do whatever it takes.

27:30.716 --> 27:34.186
Mr. Vogelman, how many
personals had you responded
to prior to Miss Frutt's?

27:34.253 --> 27:36.155
Around five or six.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.224
And based
upon your experience,
is it your expectation...

27:38.290 --> 27:40.226
that whatever you read
in a personal...

27:40.292 --> 27:42.328
<i>is going to be accurate?</i>
I hope so.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.563
When you and Miss Frutt met,
did she seem...

27:44.630 --> 27:46.698
to live up to whatever
expectations you had?

27:46.765 --> 27:49.801
Actually, she exceeded them...
at first.

27:49.868 --> 27:53.372
So you formed a
subsequent opinion based upon
your meeting her personally?

27:53.439 --> 27:55.373
Well, I suppose I did.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.076
Yet you don't feel
Miss Frutt was free to
form a subsequent opinion?

27:58.143 --> 28:01.146
- Not on sight, no.
- <i>You would</i>
<i>consider it unusual...</i>

28:01.212 --> 28:03.114
for a person to be
rejected on sight?

28:03.181 --> 28:06.151
I was expressly led to believe
that she wouldn't.

28:06.217 --> 28:08.253
Have you been rejected
on sight before,
Mr. Vogelman?

28:08.319 --> 28:11.556
Many, many, many times.
Did you take
these women to court?

28:11.622 --> 28:14.125
This woman made
false representations.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.561
Ah! So you weren't hurt
by the rejection,

28:16.627 --> 28:19.030
you were hurt
by her representations?

28:19.097 --> 28:21.199
You're doing
a tricky lawyer thing now.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.768
I'm just trying to get
at the root of your pain
and suffering.

28:23.834 --> 28:26.771
Other women have rejected you
who you didn't sue.
Miss Frutt, you do sue.

28:26.837 --> 28:29.207
Was it just because
she ran an ad,

28:29.274 --> 28:31.376
or were you somehow
hurt more here?

28:31.442 --> 28:33.378
Both.

28:33.444 --> 28:35.313
Okay.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.882
And why did Miss Frutt's
rejection hurt more?

28:37.948 --> 28:40.084
I won't be subjected
to tricky lawyer questions.

28:40.150 --> 28:42.319
<i>There's nothing tricky</i>
<i>about this, Mr. Vogelman.</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:44.555
You filed a lawsuit here
over a broken date.

28:44.622 --> 28:48.993
I'm asking you why did this hurt
more than the other times
you've been rejected?

28:49.059 --> 28:51.028
First, I was set up
for a bigger fall.

28:51.095 --> 28:53.297
She led me to believe
she wasn't like the others.

28:53.363 --> 28:55.032
And second?

28:56.333 --> 28:58.769
Is there a second?

29:00.570 --> 29:04.041
Second, she's not like
the others.

29:06.310 --> 29:08.278
How so?

29:08.345 --> 29:10.414
I plead the fifth.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.549
You can't do that
at a civil deposition, sir.

29:12.616 --> 29:15.952
How is she not like
the other women
who have rejected you?

29:17.554 --> 29:19.456
She's not pretty.

29:21.558 --> 29:27.364
I mean, she <i>is</i> to me,
but not in a conventional--

29:30.600 --> 29:33.603
When attractive women say no,
I guess I've been able
to rationalize...

29:33.670 --> 29:35.605
that they either
have a boyfriend...

29:35.672 --> 29:37.841
or at least
lots of choices.

29:39.709 --> 29:42.111
With you,

29:42.178 --> 29:44.948
I knew for a fact
that you had no other choices.

29:45.014 --> 29:48.417
You led me to believe
you were somewhat desperate.

29:48.484 --> 29:52.488
Then upon one look at me,
you evidently said to yourself,
"Not that desperate."

29:54.157 --> 29:56.025
Imagine--

29:56.092 --> 29:58.227
Imagine what it feels like
to be the nerd...

29:58.294 --> 30:01.864
that can't even get the fat girl
by the punch bowl.

30:05.468 --> 30:08.271
She deserves to die.

30:08.337 --> 30:12.708
I realize that
Massachusetts doesn't have
the death penalty, Your Honor,

30:12.775 --> 30:14.743
but I feel that she
would warrant it...

30:14.810 --> 30:18.213
for what she did
to my brother.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.348
It wasn't enough
that she disgraced...

30:20.416 --> 30:23.351
and devastated him
with an extramarital affair.

30:23.418 --> 30:25.954
Afraid of losing money,

30:26.021 --> 30:28.691
she poisoned him.

30:28.757 --> 30:31.927
This is a man
who never hurt anybody,

30:31.994 --> 30:36.198
who never treated her
with anything but love...

30:36.264 --> 30:38.133
and kindness.

30:39.434 --> 30:42.270
He would probably
even find some way
to forgive her,

30:42.337 --> 30:44.406
but I can't.

30:47.742 --> 30:50.278
You murdered a wonderful man.

30:50.345 --> 30:52.547
<i>Please address your remarks</i>
<i>to me, Mrs. Clark.</i>

30:55.450 --> 30:57.452
I would ask
that you punish this woman...

30:57.519 --> 31:00.054
in a manner commensurate
with her crime.

31:03.024 --> 31:06.327
- Mr. Pratt, anybody else?
- No, Your Honor.

31:06.394 --> 31:08.596
Counsel?

31:08.663 --> 31:13.000
Your Honor, I would only say
that my client maintains
her innocence of this crime.

31:13.067 --> 31:16.103
Yes, well, for this proceeding,
I must presume her guilt.

31:16.170 --> 31:19.440
I understand.
I would only add that the crime
for which she was convicted,

31:19.506 --> 31:21.976
though not technically
one of passion,

31:22.043 --> 31:24.912
was one the state claims
to be motivated by passion.

31:24.979 --> 31:27.381
She has no previous record.

31:27.448 --> 31:30.317
I would also ask Your Honor
to take into account...

31:30.384 --> 31:34.555
the circumstantial nature
of the prosecution's case
in sentencing.

31:34.621 --> 31:36.523
Thank you.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.559
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I'll take this</i>
<i>under advisement.</i>

31:38.625 --> 31:40.761
Your Honor, I'm an attorney
of record on this case,

31:40.827 --> 31:42.729
and I'd like to make
a brief statement.

31:42.796 --> 31:45.566
I'm not interested
in any statement
attorney Donnell has to make.

31:45.632 --> 31:48.201
I'm not interested
in directing
my statement to you.

31:52.473 --> 31:54.340
I'll hear you, counsel.

31:57.578 --> 32:00.747
We all have roles to play
in this process.

32:00.814 --> 32:05.118
My role was, and still is,
to protect that man
sitting right there.

32:05.185 --> 32:09.522
Your role is to evaluate
all the evidence,

32:10.724 --> 32:14.327
all the circumstances
surrounding the evidence...

32:14.394 --> 32:19.265
and all the facts
that you may find
to mitigate this matter.

32:19.332 --> 32:22.302
I know what
my role is, counsel.
Thank you.

32:22.368 --> 32:26.039
I would ask that, Your Honor,
when you take this
under advisement,

32:26.106 --> 32:31.377
that you let yourself
be guided not only
by the law,

32:31.444 --> 32:35.515
but by your wisdom...
and your conscience.

32:36.749 --> 32:39.218
As you've said many times,

32:39.284 --> 32:42.021
you're the one
who gets to wear the robe.

32:43.556 --> 32:45.458
I would ask...

32:46.859 --> 32:49.028
that you wear it proudly.

33:07.212 --> 33:09.348
Where does it end?

33:09.414 --> 33:11.616
You fire somebody
because he's fat
or little...

33:11.683 --> 33:15.420
or 'cause of a toupee
or 'cause he looks
like a monkey?

33:15.487 --> 33:19.324
It's shameful.
It's not a decent way
to treat people.

33:19.391 --> 33:23.161
There's an implied covenant
of good faith in every contract,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:23.228 --> 33:28.833
There's an implied agreement:
You perform your job,
you do good work,

33:28.900 --> 33:30.735
you don't get fired
for looking funny.

33:30.802 --> 33:34.673
This man gave himself
to that newspaper
for nine years,

33:34.739 --> 33:36.541
then he's suddenly cut loose...

33:36.608 --> 33:39.277
'cause his boss doesn't feel
like seeing his face.

33:39.343 --> 33:42.213
It's mean.
It's unfair.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.449
Harry Papp deserved better.

33:45.516 --> 33:48.386
Where does it end?

33:48.452 --> 33:51.856
Where does it end?
Well, it begins
and ends with the law.

33:51.923 --> 33:55.526
The law says
you cannot discriminate
on skin color...

33:55.593 --> 33:58.496
or gender or ethnicity
or handicaps,

33:58.562 --> 34:03.667
but it provides no
special protection to people
who look like monkeys.

34:03.734 --> 34:06.003
<i>Now, of course,</i>

34:06.069 --> 34:08.005
there is an implied
covenant of fairness.

34:08.071 --> 34:10.308
But please--
One rule of fairness must be...

34:10.373 --> 34:14.777
that if a man takes
the personal and financial risks
to start his own company,

34:14.844 --> 34:17.313
<i>he must be allowed</i>
<i>to control that company.</i>

34:17.380 --> 34:22.585
And if he wants to cater
to his personal aesthetic taste,
he should be allowed to.

34:22.652 --> 34:24.755
It is his company.

34:24.822 --> 34:29.326
And let's remember,
it wasn't just that
Mr. Papp looks like a monkey.

34:29.391 --> 34:31.762
He was an unhappy monkey,

34:31.829 --> 34:34.431
which made <i>The Hub</i>
a less fun place to work.

34:34.496 --> 34:36.666
And there are other
reporters and workers
at <i>The Hub</i> too.

34:36.733 --> 34:38.701
What about them?

34:38.768 --> 34:42.906
<i>And by his own admission,</i>
<i>Mr. Papp wasn't</i>
<i>terribly skilled.</i>

34:42.973 --> 34:44.741
He wasn't popular
among his coworkers.

34:44.806 --> 34:48.110
And not to make too much
of this film critic business,

34:48.178 --> 34:51.514
but let's consider
the job he does.

34:51.581 --> 34:54.150
Well, truth be told,
he doesn't <i>do</i> anything.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.819
He doesn't walk planks.
He doesn't take risks.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.289
He just sits back and watches--

34:59.356 --> 35:02.859
watches what other people do,
and then gives his opinion.

35:02.925 --> 35:08.164
I mean, is it any wonder
that Harry Papp has grown
to be so embittered?

35:08.230 --> 35:12.602
<i>He goes to the movies</i>
<i>and writes about whether</i>
<i>he likes it or not.</i>

35:12.669 --> 35:15.404
That is his life's work.

35:15.471 --> 35:18.340
How could he not
end up embittered?

35:18.407 --> 35:22.311
How could he not feel
that his life is a big waste?

35:22.378 --> 35:27.316
Now, Harry Papp
may be a nice man,
but he's angry--

35:27.383 --> 35:33.389
angry that his profession
is not taken seriously
by his peers or by anybody,

35:33.455 --> 35:36.092
and he's looking to
take it out on Mr. Holt.

35:36.158 --> 35:39.228
And he is lazy.

35:39.295 --> 35:42.564
<i>He has shown</i>
<i>almost zero initiative,</i>

to be anything other
than a watcher.

By law, I accept
the jury's verdict,

was statutory.
