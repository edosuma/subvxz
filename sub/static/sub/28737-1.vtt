00:00.943 --> 00:03.908
Marie Winter has a dirt
file here in prison.

00:04.449 --> 00:07.346
Once I get a hold of it, we
won't just nail her protector,

00:07.374 --> 00:09.205
we'll have her entire network.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.698
Well, good, 'cos that's your job.

00:10.750 --> 00:12.785
Taylah, what the fuck
did you do with that gear?

00:12.842 --> 00:15.949
I told Kaz where I stashed it, she
said she'd get rid of it for me.

00:18.093 --> 00:20.226
Marie? Marie?!

00:20.257 --> 00:22.000
You need to stay away from Kaz.

00:22.005 --> 00:23.457
Come on, I'm not afraid of her.

00:23.473 --> 00:25.809
- She's already tried once.
- That gear?

00:25.934 --> 00:27.287
She poisoned me?

00:27.303 --> 00:28.578
Or you'll what, Kaz?

00:28.625 --> 00:31.924
- Slip them some gear laced with rat poison?
- The fuck?

00:34.026 --> 00:36.435
- Still reckon she wouldn't dog ya.
- You crossed Kaz.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.683
Kaz is your best friend, and
you picked Marie over her.

00:38.693 --> 00:40.494
Kaz tried to kill Marie.

00:40.509 --> 00:41.961
- I can't trust you.
- What?

00:41.977 --> 00:43.215
We're done.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.069
Chamberlain, the doctor you
assaulted, he dropped dead.

00:49.084 --> 00:50.948
What are my chances of being convicted?

00:50.953 --> 00:52.363
You're fucked.

00:55.989 --> 00:56.989
You're pregnant.

00:56.999 --> 00:59.408
- I wanna be a proper dad...
- There's no "we", Jake.

00:59.439 --> 01:01.635
I'm having this baby on my own.

01:02.332 --> 01:03.378
I've got the money.

01:03.404 --> 01:05.101
You are not getting anything...

01:07.281 --> 01:08.525
That's not Ferguson!

01:10.939 --> 01:12.786
Channing has shot her
right in front of me.

01:12.853 --> 01:14.352
Murphy was the blackmailer.

01:14.389 --> 01:16.376
- There might be a way out of this.
- How?

01:16.792 --> 01:19.659
Derek Channing, formerly a
correctional services manager,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.470
will be remanded over the murder

01:21.480 --> 01:23.249
of former Wentworth Corrections Officer

01:23.281 --> 01:26.403
Brenda Murphy and
ex-governor Joan Ferguson.

01:27.173 --> 01:29.774
Ruby's out... you're fighting me.

01:31.913 --> 01:34.510
Your sister's a coward.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.813
Finish her!

01:38.229 --> 01:39.941
She killed Dragovic.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.738
Where's Winter's file?

01:44.754 --> 01:46.127
You never fucking had it, did ya?

01:46.174 --> 01:48.547
You strung us along,
you murdered an inmate.

01:48.558 --> 01:51.264
We're calling it, the
undercover op is finished.

01:51.284 --> 01:52.585
We're cutting you loose.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.076
_

02:56.743 --> 02:58.812
You're being released back into general.

03:15.305 --> 03:16.900
Thanks for getting me out of that hole.

03:16.942 --> 03:19.140
- How'd you go?
- No record as an undercover.

03:19.186 --> 03:22.983
All I found was Rita Mitchell,
a uniformed member NWA.

03:23.041 --> 03:25.076
That was over a decade ago.

03:34.411 --> 03:36.492
Have you heard about
Marie's sentence, Governor?

03:36.513 --> 03:37.882
Not yet, Novak.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.888
Clearly some level of
corruption has been involved,

03:40.894 --> 03:43.557
but I'll have a hard time proving
it, if they disappeared your file.

03:43.573 --> 03:46.887
You're saying, as far as
the cops go, I don't exist?

03:47.548 --> 03:49.395
She got 15 years.

03:52.174 --> 03:53.511
15 years.

03:58.854 --> 04:01.842
15 fucking years.

04:02.523 --> 04:05.578
If you plead self-defence I
may be out to get the charges

04:05.580 --> 04:07.316
knocked down to manslaughter.

04:07.441 --> 04:11.265
- But you're still looking at...
- 15 fucking years.

04:11.294 --> 04:15.157
Shit lawyers, "Don't do anything
to aggravate your sentence."

04:15.180 --> 04:18.250
"Keep your head down."
Well, where did that get me?

04:18.375 --> 04:19.791
Wow.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.210
Now people are gonna pay.

04:24.188 --> 04:25.769
What are you in for?

04:26.192 --> 04:27.486
Murder.

04:36.501 --> 04:39.597
Hey, anything you need,
just... come see me, yeah?

04:52.193 --> 04:53.328
Through here.

04:54.238 --> 04:56.637
- What's going on?
- Governor wants to see you.

04:57.980 --> 04:59.399
Thank you, Mr Jackson.

05:00.018 --> 05:01.798
I heard about your sentence.

05:01.876 --> 05:03.822
I know it's more than
you were expecting.

05:03.832 --> 05:05.503
I just want to get back to my unit.

05:05.519 --> 05:08.636
It is never easy, particularly at first.

05:08.761 --> 05:10.970
But I want a guarantee there
won't be any trouble as a result.

05:10.994 --> 05:12.695
- Is that clear?
- Perfectly.

05:12.820 --> 05:15.614
There'll be no trouble from
me, I can promise you that.

05:19.049 --> 05:21.021
Take Winter back to her unit.

05:22.270 --> 05:25.516
She's making all the right noises,
I'm not sure I can trust her.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.717
Well, she's been a model
prisoner the past few months.

05:27.733 --> 05:30.517
Yeah, she had every reason to
be, now she's an unknown quantity.

05:30.642 --> 05:32.697
- Keep a close eye on her.
- OK.

05:43.061 --> 05:45.221
- What happened?
- All went to shit.

05:47.052 --> 05:48.932
You've got visitors.

06:00.254 --> 06:01.775
Bit of overkill, isn't it?

06:01.794 --> 06:03.184
We heard about your sentence.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.922
Ah, so you're here to console me?

06:04.958 --> 06:07.009
Nothing short of what you deserve.

06:07.904 --> 06:09.985
Least I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

06:10.110 --> 06:12.774
Hey, I know you've been
laying low, hoping for release.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.094
But if you think this is a
game-changer, think again.

06:16.354 --> 06:18.841
I think you're a touch paranoid, Kaz.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.947
I've got no power in here.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.344
So, I'd be stupid to take on
you and your army, wouldn't I?

06:25.396 --> 06:27.855
I'm not talking about
me, talking about Rita.

06:27.883 --> 06:30.260
Not interested, I just
want to get outta here.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.400
Enjoying the new digs.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.743
You know what they say,

06:38.868 --> 06:40.580
you lay down with dogs...

06:40.595 --> 06:43.374
- Oh what? You get loyalty!
- Good luck with that.

06:54.858 --> 06:56.829
- What happened?
- I don't know.

06:56.866 --> 06:59.431
I was told the strings that people...

06:59.858 --> 07:01.986
God, I'm as shocked as you are.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.483
So, what now?

07:04.514 --> 07:07.194
Well I'm gonna appeal,
I'm not accepting this.

07:07.834 --> 07:09.060
Hey...

07:11.731 --> 07:13.180
... at least we'll be together.

07:15.899 --> 07:17.060
Yeah.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.966
Ooh... don't pull.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.180
Hey, Ms Bennett!

07:28.220 --> 07:29.629
You've really popped!

07:29.650 --> 07:30.667
Oh...

07:30.675 --> 07:32.570
Yeah, can you still work like that?

07:32.578 --> 07:34.700
Yeah, pregnancy's not
an illness, Jenkins.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.615
I can still do
everything perfectly well.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.477
- You ever gonna tell us who the father is?
- Yeah.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.161
Finally let you out. Welcome back.

07:48.860 --> 07:51.559
- What happened with Marie?
- 15 years.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.769
I'm fucked as well.

07:55.831 --> 07:57.220
Can we just have a minute?

08:01.002 --> 08:02.714
You watch your back, OK?

08:02.787 --> 08:05.420
- Why? What did she say?
- Just shit she thinks I want to hear,

08:05.436 --> 08:07.163
but I don't buy it for a second.

08:07.288 --> 08:08.526
She's coming.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.659
For both of us.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.138
Oi.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.411
- You heard about Marie?
- Yeah.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.415
Yeah? Well, you've
got to get out of here.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.704
- Your lawyer's find anything?
- Nah.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.508
Dodgy bastards erased my
entire history from the unit.

08:32.438 --> 08:33.724
How?

08:33.947 --> 08:36.450
- Everyone knows who you are.
- Rue,

08:36.471 --> 08:38.131
the whole point being an undercover cop

08:38.145 --> 08:40.488
is no-one knows you're a
cop, not even other cops.

08:40.503 --> 08:41.886
Yeah, but you were in uniform.

08:41.913 --> 08:43.780
NWA over ten years ago.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.015
Still, it's not like you're
gonna turn into a biker.

08:46.028 --> 08:48.286
Plenty of former cops turn bad, Rue.

08:48.499 --> 08:50.310
- Oh, shit.
- I know.

08:50.362 --> 08:53.546
- That's the fucked-button.
- Fucked-button?

08:56.380 --> 08:57.990
I'm scared for you, Rite.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.717
You know Marie'll
want payback for Drago.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.750
- She's got no crew.
- Yeah, but she's got some weird pals.

09:03.786 --> 09:06.319
- She's like the Boogie Man, or something!
- Don't talk like that.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.636
True.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.122
Hey, I can handle myself.

09:11.247 --> 09:12.512
What's that?

09:13.300 --> 09:15.103
These came for you.

09:16.278 --> 09:17.709
This fella?

09:17.719 --> 09:19.935
He called it quits.

09:19.972 --> 09:21.975
Yeah, well, he must've changed his mind.

09:21.991 --> 09:24.780
He's been writing twice a week
since you've been in the slot.

09:24.968 --> 09:26.539
He's a persistent follower,

09:26.664 --> 09:29.729
reckon he still wants to marry ya! Eh?

09:29.854 --> 09:32.118
I reckon I'm gonna have
to knock that on the head.

09:33.304 --> 09:35.562
Why don't you just sit down,
show me what you've got?

09:35.573 --> 09:37.395
Yeah, look, I'll show you what I've got.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.913
So, we go left into this corridor,

09:39.939 --> 09:42.088
- and then, right into the heart.
- Yeah...

09:42.099 --> 09:44.653
you don't need to write all
that shit down, all right?

09:44.654 --> 09:47.209
Just... keep sticking with me, OK?

09:47.500 --> 09:49.858
Wh... what if you're not here?

09:49.874 --> 09:52.283
Hello? I'm in prison, where am I going?

09:53.058 --> 09:56.112
Oh, just... give me that,
I'll draw you a fucking map.

09:57.418 --> 09:59.660
Listen I'm gonna need
you as extra muscle.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.935
- Why?
- Marie got 15 years.

10:01.987 --> 10:03.959
She's got nothing to lose now.

10:05.011 --> 10:07.420
Do you think she might
try and shiv you again?

10:07.700 --> 10:09.314
She'll do something.

10:09.820 --> 10:12.848
Oh, my God, love, that's not good.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.580
Who's Marie, again?

10:23.332 --> 10:25.242
Well, this changes everything.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.613
How do you mean?

10:29.472 --> 10:32.735
We can't keep hiding this
for the next 15 years.

10:34.353 --> 10:36.408
I... guess I never thought about it.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.791
I thought you were getting out.

10:39.150 --> 10:42.424
- Yeah, me, too.
- Which is the reason I wanted to continue this.

10:43.111 --> 10:45.691
Look, sooner or later,
we'd get sprung, and...

10:45.702 --> 10:48.043
Yes, I'd get fired and
never see you again.

10:52.481 --> 10:54.417
We should be realistic, I think.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.555
What, you want to cut it off?

10:57.909 --> 10:59.413
Are you OK with that?

11:02.341 --> 11:03.820
It's probably a good idea.

11:07.606 --> 11:09.350
So, we agree, then?

11:11.879 --> 11:12.940
Yeah.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.932
The lawyer reckons I could be
in here for a very long time,

11:25.968 --> 11:28.095
even if I plead self-defence.

11:28.268 --> 11:30.313
Yeah... I'm sticking by you, Rite.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.539
Ray, you're not listening to me.

11:32.815 --> 11:34.751
I want you to get on with
your life, not waste it

11:34.761 --> 11:36.618
pining on someone you can't be with.

11:36.940 --> 11:38.252
Damnit.

11:38.856 --> 11:40.540
The last three months killed me.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.415
I thought I'd fucked it when
you didn't answer any more,

11:42.426 --> 11:44.954
but it gave me some
thinking time, and...

11:46.650 --> 11:48.393
I can't live without you.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.047
Well, you're gonna have to.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.180
Marie.

12:24.546 --> 12:27.152
So, we are... right here?

12:27.178 --> 12:30.285
- Yep, this is the hub.
- Yeah, and we're heading there.

12:30.493 --> 12:32.175
- Oh, the showers?
- Showers.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.804
- The showers...
- Lucas? It's Marie,

12:33.819 --> 12:36.322
I need you to visit as
soon as possible, all right?

12:36.634 --> 12:38.860
Jenkins? Governor wants to see you.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.488
- What for? I haven't done nothing.
- Don't argue, just move.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.172
Not you, Birdsworth,
go back to your unit.

12:45.208 --> 12:46.670
Tell your shadow to go.

12:46.712 --> 12:49.746
Stay! Just use the map, the map!

13:04.283 --> 13:05.396
You lost?

13:06.972 --> 13:09.381
- You're Marie.
- Yeah, that's right.

13:09.694 --> 13:11.572
Well, don't worry, I'll look after you.

13:11.639 --> 13:12.867
All right.

13:12.909 --> 13:16.175
- I've... I've got a map.
- Ah... salud.

13:16.208 --> 13:19.372
Well, don't give me that
look, Jenkins, it's good news.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.220
A date's been set for your parole
hearing in two months' time.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.975
Fucking hell! That's the best
fricking news ever, isn't it?!

13:24.986 --> 13:26.458
Yeah, now I do need to remind you

13:26.490 --> 13:28.582
that just because you
are eligible for parole

13:28.597 --> 13:30.398
doesn't automatically
mean you'll be granted it.

13:30.420 --> 13:33.800
No... no, I've got to pass
my parole hearing first.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.230
Yeah. And in meantime, you
have to be a model prisoner.

13:36.246 --> 13:37.783
- So, no fighting...
- Fuck no.

13:37.808 --> 13:38.811
So...

13:39.411 --> 13:40.826
No swearing.

13:41.213 --> 13:42.405
Shit.

13:42.963 --> 13:44.157
Sorry.

13:44.192 --> 13:47.047
OK, all right, and you have to
fulfil any required programme.

13:47.073 --> 13:49.232
Yep, whatever you say.

13:51.951 --> 13:54.240
_

13:54.365 --> 13:56.855
OK, let's go through the details.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.975
Hey! I've got to talk to ya.

13:59.997 --> 14:03.215
- I... I can't be your muscle no more.
- Why? What's up?

14:03.229 --> 14:06.180
It's me parole hearing, it's
coming up in, like, two months.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.700
Huh!

14:07.740 --> 14:09.395
- Congratulations!
- Yeah!

14:09.420 --> 14:11.964
Oh... sorry.

14:11.997 --> 14:14.117
'Cos I know you're worried
about Marie and everything.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.990
But you know, maybe she
won't even try nothing?

14:15.997 --> 14:17.889
The fuck are you doing with Liz?

14:18.423 --> 14:20.479
Oh, she was lost, the poor thing.

14:20.498 --> 14:22.040
Her friends just abandoned her.

14:22.046 --> 14:24.966
There you are! I was
worried where you'd get to.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.035
- You all right, Liz?
- Yes...

14:27.074 --> 14:29.422
I think so. Why wouldn't I be?

14:30.189 --> 14:32.860
Fucking told you not to leave Liz alone.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.430
Well, I couldn't help it, could I?!

14:34.446 --> 14:36.698
What did she want to
see you about, love?

14:36.726 --> 14:37.812
- Oh...
- Boom?

14:37.843 --> 14:38.975
Hey.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.124
What are you lard-asses doing
here? Come on, we've got a game on.

15:02.221 --> 15:04.666
Move, move, move!

15:05.200 --> 15:07.841
Oi, hot stuff! No rough
play, or you're out.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.169
- Come on, I didn't fucking do anything!
- So!

15:10.195 --> 15:11.691
Ahem the fuck up, Lizzy!

15:11.730 --> 15:13.620
Channing's trial date's been set.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.848
There's nothing to worry about,
he's ganged-up for Murphy's murder.

15:16.867 --> 15:18.540
Over here, Booms!

15:18.580 --> 15:21.460
What if he starts mouthing
off about his blackmail story?

15:21.585 --> 15:24.540
No-one will believe him, they
all think he's a cokehead.

15:24.580 --> 15:27.424
Plus, they've shut down the
investigation to the senior staff.

15:27.476 --> 15:29.355
- I hope you're right.
- Shit, look out!

15:31.794 --> 15:34.181
- Are you OK?
- I fucking warned you, Costa!

15:34.240 --> 15:35.495
Get off the court now.

15:35.508 --> 15:37.192
- What the fuck?!
- You could've hurt Vera!

15:37.231 --> 15:40.035
Vera? Did you knock her up, Mr Stewart!

15:43.436 --> 15:45.303
All right, that's it,
everyone off the court now.

15:45.316 --> 15:47.775
- I'm shutting this down, give it here.
- That's not fair!

15:47.794 --> 15:49.427
No, she's the idiot, not us!

15:49.446 --> 15:51.500
If you don't like it,
get back to your units.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.328
Hey.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.869
Are you holding?

15:58.340 --> 15:59.892
Fuck off.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.538
Hey, what's that?

16:02.787 --> 16:05.206
- Oh, wow!
- Hey, Rita!

16:05.239 --> 16:06.780
You seeing this? Look up there!

16:06.799 --> 16:09.232
Oh, he's serious about you!

16:12.697 --> 16:15.669
_

16:17.797 --> 16:21.706
- "Marry me, Rita!"
- Say yes! Say yes!

16:21.732 --> 16:24.190
That's lovely, Rita!

16:30.844 --> 16:32.855
Ray? What the fuck do
you think you're doing?

16:32.873 --> 16:35.391
If you don't say "yes",
I'll have to keep going.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.895
You're gonna blow all your money on *.

16:37.915 --> 16:41.385
- Yeah, until you change your mind.
- It's not gonna happen, Ray.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.660
If you get married, sis,
can I be your best man?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.548
I'm not getting fucking married!

16:47.751 --> 16:50.899
Can you just drop the overprotective
stuff, Jake, it is nauseating.

16:50.919 --> 16:53.403
- You don't have the right to tell me what I can...
- The right?

16:53.416 --> 16:55.628
- Give me a break.
- It's bad enough that the staff

16:55.667 --> 16:57.633
- know you're the father...
- Not that you've ever acknowledged it.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.735
I don't need the prisoners
finding out, as well!

16:59.776 --> 17:03.300
Vera, I accept we won't
be honeymooning in Hawaii.

17:03.425 --> 17:04.704
But whether you like it or not,

17:04.710 --> 17:06.641
I have a right to be
part of this child's life.

17:08.780 --> 17:10.096
Governor? Dr Miller's here.

17:10.106 --> 17:11.424
- Ah, send him in.
- Come on through.

17:11.444 --> 17:12.506
What's wrong?

17:12.631 --> 17:14.759
I'm here to deliver the baby.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.396
Sorry!

17:17.621 --> 17:19.499
It's not true, I'm a psychiatrist.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.272
Er, this is Jake Stewart.

17:21.299 --> 17:23.183
He's one of my senior officers.

17:23.199 --> 17:24.993
- Good to meet you, Jake.
- Likewise.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.923
Dr Miller is joining the team,
we are very lucky to have him.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.535
He's highly credentialed.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.260
As what, a stand-up comic?

17:32.340 --> 17:34.317
Yeah, I did try that in
Edinburgh once, but uh,

17:34.369 --> 17:36.102
medicine got the better of me.

17:36.424 --> 17:38.220
Well, you made the right choice.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.102
Dr Miller's been awarded
a prestigious grant.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.180
It's got special interests
in Anti-Recidivism.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.364
Well, that will come
in handy around here.

17:47.071 --> 17:48.538
Mr Stewart?

17:48.740 --> 17:52.134
Could you do me a favour and
give Dr Miller a bit of a tour

17:52.139 --> 17:54.278
- while I finish this report?
- Sure!

17:54.460 --> 17:56.177
Iso would be a good start.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.674
Welcome aboard, Greg.

17:58.710 --> 17:59.980
Thanks.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.225
Boomer?

18:06.703 --> 18:08.509
Oi, idiot!

18:09.060 --> 18:11.824
Hey, Mr Stewart! Who's the hottie?

18:11.844 --> 18:14.362
- Hey, pretty boy!
- G'day, you want a gobby?

18:16.300 --> 18:18.982
Oh, fuck... fuck!

18:19.107 --> 18:21.603
Actually, sorry, Mr
Stewart, I didn't mean that!

18:21.620 --> 18:24.035
- That just came out.
- Don't worry about that,

18:24.087 --> 18:26.208
I got it too when I first arrived.

18:26.220 --> 18:28.895
- Ooh!
- Hope that's the new shrink!

18:29.020 --> 18:32.260
Boomer? We training, or
you checking out the talent?

18:32.300 --> 18:34.159
I'm checking out the talent.

18:34.776 --> 18:36.506
- Well, come on here!
- Just c'mon...

18:36.901 --> 18:40.413
Hey... I've got to tell you something.

18:40.635 --> 18:42.937
My parole hearing's
coming up in two months.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.081
- What?!
- Yeah!

18:44.112 --> 18:46.945
But, erm... don't say nothing to Liz.

18:46.980 --> 18:50.022
'Cos she's, you know, she... Hey!

18:50.032 --> 18:51.515
- Yeah, OK.
- Hey.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.194
- You know, she...
- Hey, come on, Miss Parole!

18:54.227 --> 18:56.300
- Miss Parole?
- Hands up, that's it.

18:56.340 --> 18:59.359
- Boomer thinks I don't know.
- What's that, Liz?

18:59.892 --> 19:02.871
Well, Ruby's training Boomer
to disguise her own training,

19:02.900 --> 19:06.136
'cos apparently, she wanted
to hide it from someone.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.375
Harder!

19:22.428 --> 19:25.719
- Ey! You heard of knocking?
- I know what you're doing.

19:25.758 --> 19:28.380
- What, taking a piss?!
- Training Boomer?

19:28.406 --> 19:32.300
- I get out in a month, I'm gonna box.
- No, you're not!

19:32.719 --> 19:36.245
- Nothing you'll be able to do about it, eh?
- Listen,

19:36.370 --> 19:37.705
I didn't kill Drago

19:37.718 --> 19:40.384
so you could piss your life
away with one lousy punch.

19:40.664 --> 19:42.583
Well, best start training me, then,

19:42.596 --> 19:45.574
- so I can protect myself.
- Fuck you.

19:46.263 --> 19:47.850
Sissy...

19:48.982 --> 19:51.227
... I know what you've done for me.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.945
And I know what it's cost you.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.885
I'll never forget that.

19:59.050 --> 20:01.021
But I gave up Allie.

20:01.665 --> 20:05.281
I can't give up on boxing, too.

20:26.052 --> 20:27.581
Hey.

20:28.251 --> 20:32.479
- What's up?
- Oh, I'm pissed off. For you.

20:34.722 --> 20:39.171
I know it's a lot to process. You
thought I was leaving, and now...

20:41.500 --> 20:44.570
... well, everything's changed.

20:47.451 --> 20:52.219
I really love you, Allie, but
I need you to be honest with me.

20:52.915 --> 20:54.879
Are we gonna stay together?

20:56.882 --> 20:59.601
Can you commit to me now?

21:34.625 --> 21:37.181
This is the second
message I've left you.

21:37.253 --> 21:40.134
I need to speak to you
urgently, so you better show up.

21:42.878 --> 21:45.213
Hey. Are you holding?

21:45.338 --> 21:47.470
- What are you after, hon?
- Crank.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.954
Sorry, can't help you with that.

21:56.699 --> 21:58.579
Birdsworth...

21:58.638 --> 22:01.942
... showing signs of
deterioration for some time now.

22:02.807 --> 22:05.513
Perhaps you might recommend
relocating her to the psych unit...

22:05.552 --> 22:07.230
... relocating her to the psych unit.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.968
- She could be a danger to herself and us.
- Liz?

22:10.014 --> 22:12.218
There's someone I want
to introduce you to.

22:12.219 --> 22:14.899
This is Dr Miller, the
new staff psychiatrist.

22:15.107 --> 22:18.580
- Hi, Liz. Greg Miller. Pleased to meet you.
- Why?

22:19.036 --> 22:21.501
I just thought you might
like to have a chat sometime.

22:22.509 --> 22:26.405
No. No, I don't think so.

22:31.003 --> 22:34.061
- Kaz!
- There you are. I told you to wait for me!

22:34.074 --> 22:35.797
They want to stick me in the psych unit.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.997
- I know that's what they're planning.
- What are you talking about?

22:38.021 --> 22:39.758
- Who's gonna do what?
- The new shrink.

22:39.790 --> 22:42.140
No, that's not gonna
happen, not while I'm here.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.681
And I've got life.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.599
So, what took you so long?

22:49.631 --> 22:52.012
Have you forgotten where
the money comes from, Lucas?

22:52.038 --> 22:54.180
Money? That's your problem.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.334
- What?
- Everyone heard you got 15 years.

22:56.355 --> 22:57.994
Other plays are moving in.

22:58.060 --> 23:00.772
You tell those fucking ingrates
they still have a job to do!

23:00.773 --> 23:04.014
- I want my son's killer found.
- No-one is looking for his killer.

23:04.056 --> 23:05.538
No-one gives a shit.

23:05.616 --> 23:07.256
They're not dancing
to your tune any more.

23:07.297 --> 23:10.020
- Where's your fucking loyalty?!
- You're not my boss!

23:10.145 --> 23:13.073
Drago was my boss, and loyalty
is what she had for you,

23:13.074 --> 23:14.551
and look where that got her.

23:15.124 --> 23:16.648
You said she'd be getting out.

23:16.669 --> 23:18.469
You said she'd be taking revenge.

23:18.548 --> 23:20.046
- I know, but I couldn't get to her.
- You've done fuck all!

23:20.066 --> 23:22.241
I couldn't get to her,
man. She was in isolation.

23:22.262 --> 23:24.953
I've got no respect for
you, Marie. No-one has.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.857
We're tired of waiting.

23:27.487 --> 23:29.006
You're finished.

23:52.342 --> 23:53.700
Bad news?

23:54.085 --> 23:56.973
- I don't want to talk about it.
- OK.

23:57.785 --> 24:00.897
- Anything I can do?
- I don't want your help or your sympathy.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.650
I'm not a beaten dog.

24:04.976 --> 24:06.568
- Look, I just want...
- No, don't!

24:06.615 --> 24:08.248
Leave me alone.

24:10.184 --> 24:11.698
Fucking prick!

24:11.750 --> 24:13.692
You know, he fucking bleeds me dry,

24:13.713 --> 24:16.580
and now he says that no-one
gives a fuck about Danny?!

24:16.866 --> 24:18.905
You know I'm never gonna
find out who killed him.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.059
- You don't know that.
- "No-one gives a shit!"

24:21.074 --> 24:22.563
You know what? Well, fuck them all!

24:22.573 --> 24:24.426
I should've got revenge on Kaz and Rita.

24:24.452 --> 24:26.195
No! You were right to let it go.

24:26.221 --> 24:28.900
- I did not let that go. I put that on hold.
- Marie,

24:28.940 --> 24:32.335
Rita is gonna be punished,
OK? She's facing 15 years, too.

24:32.350 --> 24:35.020
You're gonna be stuck with
both of them for a long time.

24:35.259 --> 24:36.945
Don't make your life...

24:38.194 --> 24:41.940
... OUR life harder than it needs to be.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.709
OK?

24:44.995 --> 24:47.092
OK? I can't commit to that.

24:52.498 --> 24:53.721
OK.

24:54.018 --> 24:55.443
You're right.

24:57.046 --> 25:00.236
I don't wanna lose you again, eh?

25:11.501 --> 25:13.280
What's going on between you and Winter?

25:13.936 --> 25:15.013
Nothing.

25:15.471 --> 25:17.819
It's not the first time I've
seen you two having private chats.

25:17.843 --> 25:19.664
- Look, she was sad, I just...
- Are you fucking her?

25:19.680 --> 25:20.866
No!

25:22.448 --> 25:24.831
- You know she's on with Allie.
- Look, I said I'm not, OK?

25:25.620 --> 25:28.161
OK, well, just a heads-up.

25:28.379 --> 25:31.173
You might want to keep your
distance, 'cos it looks suss.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.856
So, you finally said yes to a visit,

25:43.981 --> 25:46.827
which I'm thinking can
only mean one thing.

25:49.033 --> 25:50.714
You've caved.

25:52.691 --> 25:54.481
You won't want to
marry me any more, Ray,

25:54.507 --> 25:57.281
- not once you know the truth.
- The truth?

25:58.748 --> 26:02.417
You're, um... you're
married to someone else.

26:07.370 --> 26:10.877
I'm an undercover cop.

26:13.588 --> 26:16.850
I befriended you to infiltrate
the Conquerors bikers club

26:16.897 --> 26:20.592
and report on their drug trafficking
and illegal gambling activities.

26:21.185 --> 26:22.683
Infiltrate?

26:24.983 --> 26:26.086
Well, I was...

26:26.138 --> 26:27.600
The whole time you've known me,

26:27.725 --> 26:29.936
throughout our entire relationship,

26:29.972 --> 26:32.808
I've been a cop, dogging a club.

26:34.739 --> 26:37.159
That's why the cops were
always one step ahead.

26:39.916 --> 26:42.221
They were picking us off, one by one.

26:44.547 --> 26:46.659
I thought it was bad luck.

26:49.719 --> 26:51.530
What the fuck?

26:54.699 --> 26:56.411
And why didn't they arrest me?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.581
Because you were my unwitting informant.

26:58.628 --> 27:01.094
- That's what I was to you.
- I'm sorry, Ray,

27:01.162 --> 27:03.395
but I have to tell you
this for your own sake.

27:03.894 --> 27:06.366
Obviously you can't breathe
a word of this to anyone,

27:06.387 --> 27:08.473
or your mates will put
a bullet through you.

27:17.777 --> 27:19.260
Who are you?

27:49.339 --> 27:50.926
How did Ray take it?

27:54.167 --> 27:55.910
No, I'm sorry, sis.

27:58.662 --> 27:59.963
Hey.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.752
There's two of us now, eh?

28:06.638 --> 28:08.324
You sure you can trust him?

28:10.014 --> 28:11.340
Yep.

28:11.380 --> 28:13.820
I'm just saying, it's a risky play.

28:15.004 --> 28:16.992
I'd trust Ray with my life.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.100
Even now.

28:26.980 --> 28:28.801
How you settling in? Anything you need?

28:29.004 --> 28:30.982
Just the person I wanted to see.

28:31.107 --> 28:32.693
Come on in.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.779
I was hoping to identify
a select group of prisoners

28:35.799 --> 28:38.042
to participate in the
anti-recidivism programme.

28:38.057 --> 28:39.077
Yeah, how can I help?

28:39.113 --> 28:41.002
Well, naturally, you
know the women well.

28:41.018 --> 28:42.898
I was wondering if you
could put together a list

28:42.927 --> 28:45.649
of the usual suspects,
just as a starting point.

28:45.675 --> 28:48.069
Yeah, I can do that.
Any particular criteria?

28:48.085 --> 28:51.086
Yeah, I'd suggest selection
based on risk, need,

28:51.123 --> 28:53.012
responsivity to any previous...

28:53.090 --> 28:55.270
Sorry to interrupt.
Governor, I need a word

28:55.280 --> 28:56.815
before you go home tonight, please.

28:57.013 --> 28:59.849
- Yeah, what is it?
- I want to resign.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.565
What?!

29:05.250 --> 29:07.097
Are you worried about Channing's trial,

29:07.139 --> 29:08.820
- what it might dredge up?
- No, it's not that.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.074
Well, then, why?

29:10.948 --> 29:13.740
Uh, it just feels like it's
time to put the past behind me,

29:13.865 --> 29:15.460
move on from this place.

29:16.620 --> 29:18.620
And I probably should have
done it a long time ago.

29:19.970 --> 29:21.787
Is there any way I can
talk you out of this?

29:21.839 --> 29:24.660
- Maybe a raise. I could...
- No. My mind's made up.

29:33.420 --> 29:36.180
I don't know how I will
survive without you, Will.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.165
At the same time, I don't
want to hold you back.

29:40.176 --> 29:41.900
It's entirely your decision to make.

29:42.025 --> 29:44.551
In that case, I'd like
to leave in two weeks.

29:45.872 --> 29:47.350
Yeah.

29:49.426 --> 29:50.899
Thank you, Vera.

29:54.744 --> 29:57.142
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Will.

30:26.213 --> 30:27.883
What have you got there, Kylee?

30:28.066 --> 30:29.627
Fuck off, it's mine!

30:29.938 --> 30:31.026
No!

30:31.042 --> 30:33.289
You were seen scoring
at the visitor's centre.

30:34.272 --> 30:35.953
Piss the fucking dog.*

30:35.979 --> 30:38.986
Look, maybe you don't know, but
I have a zero tolerance policy.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.938
- What?
- You heard.

30:40.954 --> 30:42.349
So you're gonna flush that.

30:42.380 --> 30:43.982
Like fuck I am!

30:44.060 --> 30:45.986
- This cost me all my fucking cash!
- It's either that

30:45.997 --> 30:47.535
or the steam press, and believe me,

30:47.553 --> 30:49.904
this is the far less painful option.

30:49.956 --> 30:54.181
Fuck you, bitch! No! No! No!

30:54.363 --> 30:56.140
No! No!

30:56.180 --> 30:59.696
- What have you done?!
- I'm gonna kill you!

31:00.211 --> 31:02.984
No! No!

31:03.031 --> 31:05.508
No! No! No!

31:24.027 --> 31:27.735
- You're becoming a regular customer.
- I want ice. A lot of it.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.442
Heard you were on the
roast, but from H to ice?

31:30.457 --> 31:32.716
- Things are bad!
- You want the money or not?

31:33.020 --> 31:34.580
And I'll need a knife.

31:45.047 --> 31:46.980
- Ahh... !
- This what you're after?

31:48.075 --> 31:50.458
I've got... I've got no money.

31:50.583 --> 31:51.712
It's a gift.

31:51.738 --> 31:53.809
And not only that,
I'll keep you supplied.

31:53.934 --> 31:56.629
So you come see me whenever you want it.

31:58.596 --> 32:00.020
What do you want?

32:01.874 --> 32:03.466
Kaz Proctor.

32:04.075 --> 32:06.020
I fucking hate Proctor.

32:06.364 --> 32:07.700
Me too.

32:13.207 --> 32:14.860
Didn't think you'd see me.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.146
I owe you that much.

32:16.209 --> 32:18.134
You can tell me what a lowlife dog I am.

32:18.259 --> 32:20.189
Hmm... Mm-hmm.

32:22.167 --> 32:23.723
I still wanna marry you.

32:24.664 --> 32:27.157
- What the fuck, Ray?
- Yeah.

32:28.702 --> 32:31.704
I'm a fucking cop. I
betrayed you for two years.

32:31.829 --> 32:34.100
Oh, yeah, you're good,
I'll give you that.

32:34.425 --> 32:37.210
I didn't have a fucking clue who
you were or where you were going

32:37.246 --> 32:39.260
when you went off for
all that me time, but...

32:39.796 --> 32:41.544
but you're not that good.

32:42.808 --> 32:44.837
It wasn't just sex.

32:46.002 --> 32:47.393
We have...

32:47.900 --> 32:50.509
we have a connection
unlike anything else.

32:51.169 --> 32:54.390
And you can fake a few things, but...

32:54.915 --> 32:56.695
... but I know you love me.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.937
And you can't fake that.

33:03.736 --> 33:05.058
Huh...

33:06.863 --> 33:08.700
So, you call me a mug,

33:09.563 --> 33:11.582
but you're the girl I'm gonna marry.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.536
What am I gonna do with you?

33:16.750 --> 33:18.030
Well, you can...

33:18.441 --> 33:20.694
start by explaining
if you're still a cop,

33:20.720 --> 33:22.380
what are you doing in here?

33:25.523 --> 33:28.837
I was set in here to do an
undercover job on a fellow prisoner.

33:29.139 --> 33:31.699
And that involved
killing this Drago bitch?

33:31.740 --> 33:33.796
No, that was self-defence,

33:33.832 --> 33:35.524
but my bosses weren't too impressed

33:35.540 --> 33:38.219
so the bastards cut me
off and deleted my files.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.436
So technically I'm not a cop any more.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.954
Unless I find a way to prove it,
I'm stuck in here for 15 years.

33:43.985 --> 33:46.457
Well, so you give me
these fuckers' name,

33:46.462 --> 33:47.695
I go round and have a chat

33:47.737 --> 33:49.100
- and sort something out.
- Ray...

33:49.140 --> 33:52.114
And if that doesn't work, you go public,

33:52.140 --> 33:54.736
expose these corrupt
bastards for who they are.

33:55.054 --> 33:56.469
Can't do that.

33:57.614 --> 34:00.020
Conquerors would hunt
you down and kill you,

34:00.377 --> 34:02.940
and I'd be beaten to
death by the prisoners.

34:04.284 --> 34:05.595
Yeah...

34:06.646 --> 34:07.874
There is that.

34:07.937 --> 34:10.429
If you weren't such a
dumb fuck, I'd marry you.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.846
She said yes.

34:22.411 --> 34:24.268
She said yes!

34:24.580 --> 34:26.260
We're gettin' married!

34:54.418 --> 34:57.219
Governor, I've got Connors
insisting on seeing you...

34:57.255 --> 34:58.636
- Miss Bennet...
- What is it, Connors?

34:58.660 --> 35:01.459
As prison governor, can you
perform a marriage ceremony?

35:15.660 --> 35:17.324
She's still not away.

35:17.933 --> 35:19.385
Do you reckon I should wake her up?

35:19.416 --> 35:21.356
No, Liz'll get up when she gets up.

35:22.260 --> 35:23.614
Yeah...

35:23.864 --> 35:26.156
Yeah, she seemed a bit down,
so I thought maybe I should

35:26.180 --> 35:27.660
do something with her, you know?

35:27.842 --> 35:29.620
You're a good friend, Booms.

35:29.660 --> 35:33.374
Yeah. Well, you know,
she deserves it, eh?

35:33.620 --> 35:36.420
I reckon she's gonna start to
get better real soon too, eh?

35:36.460 --> 35:37.940
No, she's not.

35:37.980 --> 35:40.184
What? You can't say that.

35:40.975 --> 35:43.119
Booms, we've just got
to hope for the best,

35:43.135 --> 35:44.660
but be prepared for the worst.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.380
Steady on!

35:46.720 --> 35:49.285
That's what you say when
someone's, like, about to die.

35:50.352 --> 35:53.552
That's the way this rotten disease goes.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.758
Yoo-hoo!

35:59.774 --> 36:01.590
There she is!

36:01.652 --> 36:03.618
Yeah, I had a lovely nap.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.334
- You're up.
- Yeah?

36:06.350 --> 36:07.510
Great!

36:07.552 --> 36:10.080
- It's time for walkies.
- You?

36:10.106 --> 36:11.927
- Exercise?
- Yeah!

36:11.953 --> 36:14.289
- Well, it's good for the brain, eh?
- Is it?

36:14.300 --> 36:15.886
- Yeah!
- Well, in that case...

36:15.896 --> 36:17.282
Come on, it's good for the brain.

36:17.306 --> 36:18.842
- Come on, Rubes.
- All right.

36:18.868 --> 36:20.788
- See you, Kaz.
- I'll meet you later.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.709
No!

36:37.053 --> 36:38.603
What the fuck?!

36:52.563 --> 36:54.460
Ahhh!

36:55.893 --> 36:58.869
Get off me! Get off me!

37:07.075 --> 37:09.178
- Drop the weapon now!
- Get back here!

37:09.220 --> 37:11.239
- Open the door.
- Drop the shiv!

37:11.260 --> 37:13.346
- Open the door.
- Drop the shiv!

37:13.393 --> 37:16.890
Open the fucking door, or
I'm gonna cut this baby out.

37:16.926 --> 37:18.576
Do what she says!

37:19.206 --> 37:21.183
Do what she says.

37:21.922 --> 37:23.727
Code blue, this is Sierra 6.

37:23.753 --> 37:25.705
Prisoner with a shiv
has the governor hostage,

37:25.736 --> 37:28.344
heading to the North Yard.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.060
Get the fuck away from her!

37:31.100 --> 37:32.878
Clear all the prisoners,
seal all the gates.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.401
Let her go!

37:36.062 --> 37:37.873
Let her go! Let her go now!

37:37.894 --> 37:40.224
Jake, Jake, back off. Watch it.

37:40.349 --> 37:43.133
Everyone out of the fucking way!

37:45.168 --> 37:47.550
It's not OK, it's not OK!

37:47.623 --> 37:50.376
- It's OK. It's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

37:50.391 --> 37:52.816
- It's OK.
- It's not...

37:54.007 --> 37:56.594
Kylee, why don't you tell
me what it is you want?

37:56.980 --> 37:59.144
I want my baby back.

37:59.980 --> 38:01.340
Fuck off!

38:03.593 --> 38:05.170
Kylee, I'm Greg Miller.

38:05.758 --> 38:09.124
- Can I talk to you?
- No, I don't wanna talk to anyone.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.867
You stay away! You keep away from me!

38:11.882 --> 38:14.177
I won't come any closer.
I just want to talk.

38:14.744 --> 38:16.815
I just want to understand what's
going on for you right now.

38:16.831 --> 38:17.991
They're all trying to get me.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.180
- They want kill me, they want to hurt me.
- No,

38:20.220 --> 38:21.939
- no
- one wants to hurt you, Kylee.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.020
- Yes, they do.
- I want to keep you safe.

38:24.957 --> 38:26.919
OK? I want to keep everyone safe.

38:27.288 --> 38:30.659
Yeah, but she's not safe.
She's never gonna be safe.

38:32.246 --> 38:34.695
I know you don't wanna hurt anybody.

38:35.222 --> 38:37.585
You don't wanna hurt
Miss Bennett, or her baby.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.119
It wasn't my fault. It wasn't
my fault. I didn't do it.

38:40.139 --> 38:42.673
That's OK, that's OK...

38:43.709 --> 38:47.461
'Cos she's dead, isn't she?

38:49.323 --> 38:51.913
No! She's dead, isn't she?

38:51.920 --> 38:54.485
- My little baby girl...
- It's OK...

38:55.989 --> 38:58.029
- That's OK...
- My little girl...

38:58.060 --> 39:00.295
It was an accident, Kylee.

39:00.490 --> 39:02.816
OK, I know you didn't
want to hurt your child...

39:02.837 --> 39:04.757
They told me, they told
me, the voices told me.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.416
She had the devil in her, she was...

39:06.437 --> 39:07.906
- Listen to my voice.
- ... she was possessed...

39:07.930 --> 39:11.442
- Listen to my voice, Kylee, OK?
- No... No!

39:12.087 --> 39:14.268
I want my baby back.

39:14.273 --> 39:16.060
OK, here's what we're gonna do.

39:16.495 --> 39:18.795
I want to come over and take
Miss Bennett by the hand,

39:18.821 --> 39:20.887
- and I want you to let her go.
- It's OK...

39:21.063 --> 39:23.264
Because you don't want
to hurt Miss Bennett.

39:25.428 --> 39:28.060
- That's OK. It's OK.
- It's OK.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.752
OK, Kylee...

39:30.870 --> 39:32.710
... I'm just gonna take
Miss Bennett's hand.

39:32.825 --> 39:34.149
OK?

39:35.380 --> 39:37.276
Where's my baby?

39:37.734 --> 39:40.044
- I know.
- My baby...

39:40.070 --> 39:42.765
I know, Kylee. I'm just
gonna take her hand, OK?

39:43.056 --> 39:44.357
OK?

39:45.689 --> 39:47.937
I've got her now, Kylee. You can let go.

39:49.472 --> 39:51.720
Make everyone safe, OK?

39:59.420 --> 40:00.732
OK.

40:03.990 --> 40:05.550
Hold her still.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.056
Steady...

40:11.971 --> 40:14.890
- You OK?
- Yeah.

40:15.015 --> 40:17.415
Let's get her into the psych
unit until she calms down, yeah?

40:17.450 --> 40:18.813
Yeah, sure.

40:21.311 --> 40:22.500
You OK?

40:29.427 --> 40:32.620
Your pulse is racing, but
the foetal heart rate is fine.

40:39.527 --> 40:41.072
I was right to be protective.

40:41.197 --> 40:43.176
- You're not being careful enough.
- No, you need to back off, Jake,

40:43.200 --> 40:45.776
- or I'll have you charged with harassment.
- It's my child too.

40:45.833 --> 40:47.498
I'm not gonna stand by
while you jeopardise...

40:47.514 --> 40:49.163
Don't you dare blame me for this!

40:49.174 --> 40:51.552
You need to be on maternity
leave, not working.

40:51.578 --> 40:53.493
- I am not an invalid.
- I...

40:55.991 --> 40:57.479
Everything all right?

40:58.171 --> 40:59.519
Yeah, it's fine.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.380
Thank you for what you did out there.

41:05.289 --> 41:07.209
You saved my baby's life.

41:13.776 --> 41:15.181
Is there a problem?

41:16.669 --> 41:18.455
Yes, he's the father.

41:18.787 --> 41:20.124
I see.

41:25.337 --> 41:28.038
Hey, love, where are you going?
There's a seat for you there.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.615
I don't think so.

41:30.213 --> 41:32.279
It's OK, Liz, I'm with Marie.

41:36.940 --> 41:38.382
Are you OK, love?

41:38.585 --> 41:40.386
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:40.511 --> 41:42.181
Why'd that girl attack you?

41:42.223 --> 41:44.319
Because she was off
her head on drugs, Liz.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.575
Hey, that new shrink was
pretty good today, eh?

41:46.592 --> 41:48.304
Oh, no, no, I don't trust him.

41:48.346 --> 41:49.594
He was a fricking hero.

41:49.620 --> 41:51.062
I reckon he'd have a big cock.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.539
I don't care about his big cock,

41:52.555 --> 41:54.469
he threw that girl into the psych unit.

41:54.594 --> 41:56.244
I don't know how much
time I've got left,

41:56.264 --> 41:58.856
but I don't want to spend it
in a psych unit, fuck that!

41:58.882 --> 42:00.911
I've still got things that I wanna do.

42:00.926 --> 42:02.340
Like what, Liz?

42:02.982 --> 42:04.260
I can't remember.

42:05.063 --> 42:07.686
Well, when you do remember,
why don't you write them down?

42:07.811 --> 42:10.295
Yeah, like... like a bucket list.

42:10.948 --> 42:13.102
- Yeah, that's what you need, Lizzy.
- A what?

42:13.113 --> 42:14.169
A bucket list.

42:14.174 --> 42:16.614
- You figure out exactly what you want, right?
- Yeah.

42:16.651 --> 42:20.751
And... and we'll make
all your dreams come true.

42:21.687 --> 42:23.212
One way or another.

42:23.220 --> 42:25.320
Oh, well, that sounds lovely!

42:25.980 --> 42:28.816
- Is it a bucket list?
- That's a bucket list, that's what we're gonna do.

42:28.820 --> 42:31.096
- Miss Bennett. Are you OK?
- Miss Bennett's here.

42:31.174 --> 42:32.780
Shitting ourselves, eh?

42:32.820 --> 42:34.863
I was gonna rugby tackle her, right?

42:34.894 --> 42:37.503
But um... I don't know, the shrink
seemed to have it under control.

42:37.527 --> 42:39.815
Thank God nothing happened
to you and the bub.

42:43.542 --> 42:47.000
Everyone, everyone,
thank you. That's... I...

42:47.220 --> 42:48.650
I really appreciate it.

42:48.660 --> 42:50.335
We're both fine.

42:50.347 --> 42:53.739
- Good.
- Connors, the general manager has approved.

42:53.802 --> 42:56.252
A civil celebrant can
perform your wedding.

42:56.263 --> 42:58.318
- Congratulations.
- Thanks so much, Miss Bennett.

42:58.443 --> 43:01.044
Does that mean I get to be the best man?

43:01.060 --> 43:04.140
Who else am I gonna ask?

43:04.265 --> 43:07.395
Hey, attention, compound!

43:07.434 --> 43:09.488
We're gonna have a fucking wedding!

43:25.341 --> 43:27.415
Hey. You wanted to see me?

43:27.688 --> 43:29.393
Come in. Shut the door.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.032
Are you OK?

43:40.782 --> 43:43.631
I'm gonna step back from
my governor's duties.

43:44.002 --> 43:46.700
- You going on maternity leave?
- No, no, not yet.

43:46.740 --> 43:48.594
I want to reduce my hours and

43:48.828 --> 43:51.365
the management stress
is just a bit too much.

43:51.401 --> 43:52.712
Fair enough.

43:53.659 --> 43:55.075
Well, I'm sure the GM will have...

43:55.090 --> 43:57.213
I need you to take
over as Acting Governor.

43:59.492 --> 44:01.001
- I've resigned.
- Postpone it.

44:01.027 --> 44:02.478
- I can't, Vera.
- I need to know

44:02.479 --> 44:03.894
I'm leaving the women in safe hands.

44:03.900 --> 44:05.415
I just don't think I'm the right person.

44:05.424 --> 44:08.420
Oh, Will, you're
exactly the right person.

44:08.545 --> 44:10.940
Nobody knows this prison like you do.

44:12.120 --> 44:15.140
- Sorry, I can't do it.
- But you care so much about the women.

44:18.466 --> 44:20.266
It's only for a few months

44:20.578 --> 44:24.622
until I come back, and then you can
leave with my blessing, I promise.

44:24.637 --> 44:27.379
- Look, I'd love to. I just don't think...
- Please do this for me.

44:30.948 --> 44:32.764
We've been through so much together.

45:11.799 --> 45:14.531
Hey, don't worry, hon, you're
not missing out on anything.

47:32.346 --> 47:34.817
Ray!

47:35.968 --> 47:38.394
Let me go!

47:38.466 --> 47:42.681
Let me go! Let me go!

47:43.455 --> 47:45.420
Ray!
