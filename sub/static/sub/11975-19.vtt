WEBVTT

00:17.133 --> 00:19.167
I'm so excited for
Miami.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.167
When are we going to
get good Miami outfit?

00:21.167 --> 00:23.200
I know.
I need some good outfits.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.200
I should see if Monica can come
this week.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.200
No, I'm texting
Monica.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.533
No, no, no, but
I'm leaving before you. Stop.

00:29.533 --> 00:33.367
Hey, Moni, I'm going
to Miami for a full Kardashian

00:33.367 --> 00:36.700
extravaganza, and I will need
divine looks.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.700
Exclamation point.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.700
How does your
thing work?

00:40.700 --> 00:42.700
- What do you mean?
- Mine doesn't.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.700
Watch.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.700
- Hi. Exclamation.
- You say exclamation

00:47.700 --> 00:51.067
- point.
- Oh.  idiot.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.067
Point. Wait.

00:53.067 --> 00:56.067
- What?!
- Monica, exclamation

00:56.067 --> 00:58.933
point.
Nope.

00:58.933 --> 01:03.633
It can't read tone.
It just reads your words.

01:03.633 --> 01:08.667
I leave town for
three weeks.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.200
Would love to do some Miami
looks.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.200
Exclamation point.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.000
- See?
- I don't know why yours

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
- does that.
- Right.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.367
Think I'm gonna take...
Spending the day with bae.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.367
Bae and day-- they

01:26.367 --> 01:28.367
- rhyme.
- Day, bae.

01:28.367 --> 01:31.467
Bae, day.
Oh, really.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.533
Do you have this much fun when
you're with Kim?

01:33.533 --> 01:36.800
Hell to the no.

01:53.267 --> 01:55.367
Lay down, put your
right arm there and then roll

01:55.367 --> 01:57.367
- yourself back.
- Okay.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.200
Just nice and easy.
Arms down by your side.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.067
Inhale, and then you're just
gonna push the carriage all the

02:01.067 --> 02:03.067
- way up.
- Wow.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.833
- Hey, Scotty.
- And lower those heels.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.433
- Hi. How are you?
- Good afternoon, sir.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.067
- How are you? Nice to see you.
- How you doing?

02:08.067 --> 02:09.900
- Nice to see you.
- Likewise. Yeah.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.433
Flat heel, push away, drive your
hips all the way down, press all

02:11.433 --> 02:13.333
- the way up.
Ay-ay-ay.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.000
This is not
childbirthing, but it's kind of

02:15.000 --> 02:16.767
close.
Lucky you're there and I'm here.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.600
Aren't you gonna try
it?

02:18.600 --> 02:20.233
- This ain't for me.
- Press away, a little

02:20.233 --> 02:21.567
- burn.
- Yeah.

02:21.567 --> 02:22.900
There we go.
Slow down.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.633
This is a like a bad
porno with a venereal disease.

02:25.633 --> 02:26.967
All the way down.
Wider.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.667
- Wider?
- Harder, wider,

02:28.667 --> 02:32.200
faster, slower, don't burn me.
Ow, it hurts when I pee. Ooh!

02:32.200 --> 02:34.100
- Last one.
- Scott makes me laugh.

02:34.100 --> 02:39.067
So it makes me really happy when
he chooses to spend time with me

02:39.067 --> 02:41.267
rather than some of his friends
that might not be the best

02:41.267 --> 02:44.100
- influence on him.
- Don't get too

02:44.100 --> 02:45.433
- nervous, don't worry.
- Okay.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.733
- I'm not...
- Oh,.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.233
- Oh, no way!
- Don't worry, buddy.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.633
I'm not wearing
boxers.

02:49.633 --> 02:51.300
Thank God.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.967
Two different
workouts. Press away.

02:52.967 --> 02:56.300
Wow.
This is something.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.967
Push the heels and
stretch the legs all the way

02:57.967 --> 02:59.633
- out to me, make a circle.
- Oh, you got to be

02:59.633 --> 03:01.633
- kidding me.
- And one, and two.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.633
I'm a guy for a
reason.

03:03.633 --> 03:05.633
I don't want to...
I'm gonna have a kid here.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.533
- Vulnerability.
- I'm not having a

03:07.533 --> 03:09.533
child!

03:09.533 --> 03:11.533
- Oh, drop it.
- Oy!

03:11.533 --> 03:13.367
And the leg's gonna go
back, it's gonna go back.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.367
What?!
This is dangerous!

03:15.367 --> 03:17.200
- I'm right here.
- This does not feel

03:17.200 --> 03:19.200
safe!

03:19.200 --> 03:20.900
- That's what she said.
- What's happening?!

03:20.900 --> 03:22.767
This is called
"enjoyment." Roll it down. One.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.600
- This is enjoyment?
- I don't think so.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.433
I feel like I'm gonna
die.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.267
- I don't like this.
- Hold the knees, open

03:28.267 --> 03:30.267
- stretch.
- Oh, my God!

03:30.267 --> 03:32.000
- Roll it down.
- How enjoyable is this?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.067
- Okay, down here.
- That was the best.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.400
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm one of the better people on

03:37.400 --> 03:39.900
- these things.
- You know what's funny?

03:39.900 --> 03:41.233
It creeps up on you.
Like, you get sore.

03:41.233 --> 03:43.900
Oh, my God, I can't
wait!

03:43.900 --> 03:46.167
That sounds amazing!
I can't wait to hurt!

03:46.167 --> 03:48.233
You want to wake your
body up.

03:48.233 --> 03:51.067
- So, I want him to come over.
- I will be here.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.367
You can do some
Pilates.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.900
You know, Scottie,
you're always telling me that

03:53.900 --> 03:55.933
you have nobody to hang out with
these days.

03:55.933 --> 03:57.833
- I don't.
- I'm doing lunch with

03:57.833 --> 03:59.767
my girlfriends next week, and
you're welcome to come.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.767
- I'm there.
- My friends love you.

04:01.767 --> 04:08.500
Okay.â™ª â™ª

04:13.800 --> 04:16.867
I love that you're
never hot or cold.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.967
Like, you could wear this, and
it'll be 200. It's...

04:18.967 --> 04:21.600
Wait. That is, like...
Seriously, you have to say that.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.900
That's, like, what everyone
says. Okay.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.800
I love that you're
never, like, hot or cold.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.200
Like, it's 90 degrees, and
you're wearing full jean jacket.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.333
And in New York when it's
two degrees, you'll wear, like,

04:31.333 --> 04:34.333
- a little skirt.
- #NeverReallyOutside.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.300
- #InMyOwnEnvironment.
- Yup.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.800
You know what's so
crazy is, I've been having,

04:40.800 --> 04:43.033
- like, just anxiety lately.
- About what?

04:43.033 --> 04:46.133
Like, every last thing.
Like, even driving here.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.033
I try to drive, like, not on
the... all the way on the

04:48.033 --> 04:49.233
- freeway...
- Right.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.033
...because what if a car
flips over and hits me?

04:51.033 --> 04:52.733
I can't believe
this is happening to you.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.133
I think of, like, every
freak accident.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.900
Leaving Caitlyn's house and
driving down the hill, I was

04:55.900 --> 04:58.433
like, "I don't care if North is
25.

04:58.433 --> 05:01.433
I'm not letting her drive up
this hill and down by herself."

05:01.433 --> 05:03.033
Oh, you're turning
into, like, a worry wart?

05:03.033 --> 05:04.600
- Everything?
- Like, totally worrying.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.167
- I'm not this person.
- No, I know you're

05:06.167 --> 05:08.500
- not.
- Like, this is on stilts,

05:08.500 --> 05:10.467
and that bothers me.
I think, like, we can get

05:10.467 --> 05:12.000
- crushed.
- You're...

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
- Now you're going crazy.
- No, it's what I think of

05:14.000 --> 05:15.467
- every single day.
- That's terrible.

05:15.467 --> 05:26.433
Yeah.â™ª â™ª

05:26.433 --> 05:29.567
Hey.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.567
- Hi.
- What's up?

05:31.567 --> 05:33.467
I just wanted to
see when you were coming over

05:33.467 --> 05:36.833
- later.
- Oh, um, I'll probably

05:36.833 --> 05:39.267
be a little bit later just
'cause I'm going to do something

05:39.267 --> 05:41.267
- in the city for a little bit.
- What are you going

05:41.267 --> 05:43.267
- to do?
- Your mom asked me to

05:43.267 --> 05:47.100
go have tea with her and
girlfriends.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.533
- Okay.
- I don't think it's

05:50.533 --> 05:54.300
- the weirdest thing, do you?
- Um...

05:54.300 --> 05:57.433
- it's just... it's random.
- Going into this whole

05:57.433 --> 06:02.000
tea party sounds okay.
I mean, I have no idea what I'm

06:02.000 --> 06:03.933
gonna talk about with all these
ladies for this amount of time,

06:03.933 --> 06:07.867
- but I'm sure I'll figure it out.
- ...Kathy. Hello there.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.700
Wow. You guys look
very fancy. I had no idea.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.700
- Hey, there.
- Hi, Scott.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.500
- Hi. How you doing?
- What's happening?

06:13.500 --> 06:15.200
At least put your
sunglasses on so we're chic.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.133
Oh, are you supposed
to wear sunglasses here?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.067
Well, when you're
having tea.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.067
- Really? Okay.
- I don't know.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.067
I'll take mine off.
But you should leave yours on.

06:23.067 --> 06:26.067
I try to see my girlfriends
every week or so.

06:26.067 --> 06:30.000
We're always hanging out, and
why not invite Scott?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.100
He's the life of the party.
So Kylie just went to a new

06:33.100 --> 06:35.100
gynecologist, and he said to
her...

06:35.100 --> 06:37.100
Oh, awesome.
I can't wait to hear about this.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.100
- That's right.
- Let's talk about all

06:39.100 --> 06:42.933
- of your daughters' vaginas.
- You have to learn how

06:42.933 --> 06:44.767
- to take care of your body.
- Scott, you know you...

06:44.767 --> 06:46.433
As a female, it's a lot
different than when you're a

06:46.433 --> 06:50.033
- male.
- Is this comfortable,

06:50.033 --> 06:51.867
- this table?
- That's why it's called

06:51.867 --> 06:53.867
"high tea."
It's goes low into me.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.867
- Get it?
- No, it's crushing my

06:55.867 --> 06:58.567
- tea.
- So what else?

06:58.567 --> 07:00.600
You have some gossip
for us?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.433
I wish I did.
I have nothing. I live alone.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.100
If you're going to
come to tea, you have to have

07:04.100 --> 07:06.100
- really good gossip.
- Okay, so...

07:06.100 --> 07:07.433
Did you sell your
house?

07:07.433 --> 07:09.800
- No.
- Rob was looking for a

07:09.800 --> 07:11.467
house one time, and I got really
mad because Rob didn't like the

07:11.467 --> 07:13.467
house I liked.
I said, "Well, this is just

07:13.467 --> 07:15.300
She literally wants to

07:15.300 --> 07:17.333
buy everything.
It's unbelievable.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.067
If I send her anything, she's
like, "Oh, my God, that's so

07:19.067 --> 07:21.067
amazing.
Is there two of them?"

07:21.067 --> 07:23.700
I feel like we should

07:23.700 --> 07:25.367
- do a girl's trip.
- Definitely, or...

07:25.367 --> 07:27.100
- Nice. I'll be there.
- Girl's trip.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.900
Nice.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.300
I was a little
nervous coming into this, but

07:31.300 --> 07:34.067
everybody's so nice and so not
intimidating.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.233
And I feel like I'm definitely
getting along even better than I

07:37.233 --> 07:39.233
- thought with all of her friends.
- Arnold Palmers?

07:39.233 --> 07:42.800
Right here for our
other girlfriend, Scott.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.633
That's what I'm here

07:44.633 --> 07:46.633
- for.
- I know.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.033
But I will say, I
really admire hanging out with

07:49.033 --> 07:51.033
you guys because it's not all
about texting and being on

07:51.033 --> 07:52.867
- your phones.
- No, we weren't even on

07:52.867 --> 07:54.767
- it.
- That's beautiful.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.600
Like, I actually get to listen
and hear things.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.433
- We're old school.
- I need to get to this

07:58.433 --> 08:00.167
- meeting. I love you guys...
- Next time we're gonna

08:00.167 --> 08:02.167
- have more gossip for you.
- I love it.

08:02.167 --> 08:04.167
- I'll see you soon.
- Love you, Scott.

08:04.167 --> 08:05.833
Can't wait to plan the
trip to Mexico for all of us.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.433
- Are you coming?
- We're going to Punta

08:07.433 --> 08:09.100
- Mita.
- What do you mean?

08:09.100 --> 08:10.933
- Somebody's got to supervise.
- Well, yeah, he's

08:10.933 --> 08:12.600
- definitely coming with us.
- We need an escort.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.033
Well, or a pool boy.

08:22.633 --> 08:27.033
Beautiful, Kendall.

08:27.033 --> 08:32.233
Gorgeous. Beautiful, Kendall.
Very strong. Beautiful.

08:32.233 --> 08:38.533
Bring the legs out.
Yes, beautiful.

08:38.533 --> 08:42.500
Hey, Kendall.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.000
Hey, Mom.
What are you doing?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.467
Going to go into a
couple meetings.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.467
Oh, okay.
Um, do you want to know the

08:50.467 --> 08:53.033
craziest thing?
So have you ever had sleep

08:53.033 --> 08:55.067
- paralysis?
- What does that mean?

08:55.067 --> 08:56.967
I don't know.
It's like you wake up, and

08:56.967 --> 08:58.800
your brain is aw...
Like your mind is awake, but

08:58.800 --> 09:01.133
your body's still asleep, so you
can't move.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.800
Like, you just wake up, and
you're fully paralyzed.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.833
- That's terrible.
- Terrifying.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.767
You feel like you're never gonna
move again.

09:06.767 --> 09:09.700
I'm freaking out because
recently, I wake up in the

09:09.700 --> 09:11.667
middle of the night and I can't
move.

09:11.667 --> 09:15.067
I looked it up online, and it's
a weird thing called sleep

09:15.067 --> 09:17.767
paralysis.
It's so scary when it happens.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.933
You literally feel like you're
never gonna get out of it.

09:19.933 --> 09:22.733
- It mainly happens on planes.
- I think you've just got

09:22.733 --> 09:24.733
incredible anxiety about
traveling.

09:24.733 --> 09:27.133
- Yeah.
- You know?

09:27.133 --> 09:30.633
And you can't have a fear of
getting on a plane because of

09:30.633 --> 09:33.600
- your anxiety attacks.
- But it's...

09:33.600 --> 09:36.867
No, no, I'm done arguing with
people because everyone says I'm

09:36.867 --> 09:39.867
fine, but I don't feel fine.
And I promise you, one day, when

09:39.867 --> 09:41.867
I'm rushed to the hospital, then
you guys are gonna wake up,

09:41.867 --> 09:43.867
because I promise you this is
not...

09:43.867 --> 09:46.600
Kendall, I believe you.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.267
- Okay.
- I don't want you to

09:51.267 --> 09:53.533
live with this anxious feeling
all the time.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.867
- That's terrible.
- Yeah, and I'm kind

09:55.867 --> 09:58.067
of freaking out.
It's so weird, 'cause I get,

09:58.067 --> 10:01.367
like, super light-headed when
I'm on planes, too.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.400
- And I feel like I'm gonna faint.
- Yeah.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.400
I don't know what to
do, 'cause I'm, like, freaking

10:05.400 --> 10:08.867
- out about even flying home.
- All right, just take a

10:08.867 --> 10:12.367
- deep breath.
- Push it, boom, boom.

10:12.367 --> 10:14.367
Oh, God.
I just don't know if it's the

10:14.367 --> 10:17.067
most appropriate thing in the
world to be half-naked with

10:17.067 --> 10:20.067
Kourtney's mom and all of her
friends doing all these weird,

10:20.067 --> 10:22.533
exotic dance moves that you'd
see in a strip club.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.533
I want to look at you
from behind.

10:24.533 --> 10:27.600
Get back to thrust.
Thrust, thrust, thrust.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.700
You have a week in

10:29.700 --> 10:34.300
- Paris, Milan, London.
I-I don't know if

10:34.300 --> 10:37.100
- I'm gonna be able to do that.
- Well, you're already

10:37.100 --> 10:40.433
- booked to do that, honey.
- I think that my

10:40.433 --> 10:42.333
health is a bigger deal.

10:55.833 --> 10:58.000
- What is going on here?
- Hi, Scott.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
- Hello.
- We're doing water

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
- aerobics.
- And would love for you

11:02.000 --> 11:05.200
- to join.
- Um...

11:05.200 --> 11:07.533
Initially, when Kris asked me
if I wanted to come over and

11:07.533 --> 11:10.167
swim in the pool, you know, I
thought, no big deal.

11:10.167 --> 11:13.333
I didn't really think it was
gonna be, like, water aerobics.

11:13.333 --> 11:16.533
We're just getting
started.

11:16.533 --> 11:19.067
It's a little weird, and I
definitely don't know what I've

11:19.067 --> 11:21.200
- gotten myself into.
- I'm Tracy, and I was

11:21.200 --> 11:23.433
- told that you guys love it hard.
- Yeah, oh, yeah, we do.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.433
That's what I...
Yes.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.433
- Yeah, we do.
- If you don't like it

11:27.433 --> 11:29.500
hard, what's gonna happen is
you're going to turn a little

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
- blue, it's gonna be good.
- Hey, Scott, why don't

11:31.500 --> 11:33.500
you be, like, the, leader.
I want to look at you from

11:33.500 --> 11:34.767
behind.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.500
- Yes.
- I think there's enough

11:36.500 --> 11:38.000
going on, I don't need to be in
the middle.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.067
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.733
- Yes.
- And so, close your

11:40.733 --> 11:44.567
eyes and feel it.
Reverse.

11:44.567 --> 11:47.333
- Scott's into it.
- It's, uh, very

11:47.333 --> 11:49.333
different.
Okeydokey.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.367
...five, come on, six.
Out your mouth, push it.

11:51.367 --> 11:53.367
It has a mind of its
own.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.600
Oh, God.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.600
Roll, Scott, come on,
roll.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.933
Give me your hips.

11:59.933 --> 12:03.367
You know...
Pretty sure I have no idea

12:03.367 --> 12:05.967
what's, uh, happening.
I mean, it's a little bit of a

12:05.967 --> 12:08.800
weird life that I lead here.
I don't think this is for guys.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.967
- Come on.
- This is like a

12:10.967 --> 12:12.967
- stripper class.
- You could give somebody

12:12.967 --> 12:15.400
- a lap dance when this is over.
- This is all for your

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
tight tush.
Squeeze, nice and tight.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.400
Scott, either you're
gonna do it or you're not.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.867
I didn't know water
aerobics was this sexual.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.967
Two, get back to
thrust.

12:23.967 --> 12:27.533
- Thrust, thrust, thrust, thrust.
- I just don't know if

12:27.533 --> 12:29.833
it's the most appropriate thing
in the world to be half-naked

12:29.833 --> 12:32.967
with Kourtney's mom and all of
her friends doing all these

12:32.967 --> 12:35.967
weird, exotic dance moves that
you'd see in a strip club.

12:35.967 --> 12:37.967
It's a little embarrassing, I'm
not gonna lie.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.733
Squeeze your butt
cheeks like you're holding a

12:39.733 --> 12:41.467
credit card.
Shake it out, come on, booty

12:41.467 --> 12:42.867
rolls.

12:42.867 --> 12:44.600
Do you care if I pee
a little?

12:44.600 --> 12:47.000
- No peeing in the pool.
- Well, I'm trying to

12:47.000 --> 12:49.033
hold it while you're doing the
jumping jacks.

12:49.033 --> 12:59.067
I have had two kids.â™ª â™ª

12:59.067 --> 13:00.600
Come do a selfie with
me.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.367
- No.
- You never do selfies

13:02.367 --> 13:04.733
with me-- one day when I'm not
here you're gonna regret it,

13:04.733 --> 13:08.200
because it's gonna be like, "I
wish I had a picture of me and

13:08.200 --> 13:10.133
my mom doing selfies in the
kitchen."

13:10.133 --> 13:11.567
- Wait.
- I feel like I just

13:11.567 --> 13:13.567
- took a picture with a fan.
- Okay.

13:13.567 --> 13:16.333
- I am a fan.
- I actually like

13:16.333 --> 13:18.667
- these, will you send 'em to me?
-  My hair.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.133
You can send 'em to
yourself.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.533
Wait, let's take
more.

13:21.533 --> 13:23.967
- Oh, whoa.
- This is a new world

13:23.967 --> 13:27.167
- for me.
- Get it, Kendall.

13:27.167 --> 13:29.733
I'm gonna caption it
"Pictures with fans."

13:29.733 --> 13:33.000
- I'm your biggest fan.
- Since when?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.733
You're my favorite.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.600
Do you want to go over your
schedule?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.867
- I mean, I guess.
- You have a week in

13:40.867 --> 13:46.100
- Paris, Milan and then London.
I-I don't know if

13:46.100 --> 13:49.700
- I'm gonna be able to do that.
- Well, you're already

13:49.700 --> 13:52.133
- booked to do that, honey.
- I can't travel that

13:52.133 --> 13:54.133
- much.
- Well...

13:54.133 --> 13:56.333
I'm, like, scared.
I'm freaking out because of

13:56.333 --> 13:59.900
these  paralysis things.
I'm scared to fall asleep

13:59.900 --> 14:01.900
because it keeps happening to
me.

14:01.900 --> 14:06.067
It's almost like... it almost
feels like my heart stops.

14:06.067 --> 14:10.333
Okay.
The nature of what you do for a

14:10.333 --> 14:13.700
living and your career is flying
around the world.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.467
You have designers that have
already booked you and are

14:16.467 --> 14:18.800
- counting on you to show up.
- I'm just telling

14:18.800 --> 14:21.767
you...
I think that my health is a

14:21.767 --> 14:25.400
- bigger deal.
- Kendall basically lives

14:25.400 --> 14:28.867
on an airplane.
So the anxiety on an airplane

14:28.867 --> 14:33.100
and the sleep paralysis is a
huge problem.

14:33.100 --> 14:37.833
Sometimes it's been so bad that
she's been paralyzed from even

14:37.833 --> 14:40.100
- getting on an airplane.
- I want to get off

14:40.100 --> 14:43.133
- the plane.
- Kendall, don't cry.

14:43.133 --> 14:47.267
And I've had to get on a plane,
fly from L.A. to London just to

14:47.267 --> 14:52.000
get her from London to New York.
So it's becoming a real problem.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.400
It's genuinely
frightening and I don't know how

14:54.400 --> 14:56.300
much of it I can do.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.233
Why are you going to tea
parties and doing water

15:03.233 --> 15:04.667
- aerobics?
- First of all, it was

15:04.667 --> 15:07.200
- high tea.
- That's a little odd.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.333
I knew this whole
water aerobics thing was gonna

15:09.333 --> 15:11.333
come back and haunt me.
I didn't want to be, like, a

15:11.333 --> 15:14.200
full-blown cougar stalker.
- Just so not like

15:14.200 --> 15:16.667
- you.
- You called me the other

15:16.667 --> 15:19.233
day to ask me a question and you
just seemed very anxious.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.233
- Yeah.
- Kendall has got the

15:21.233 --> 15:22.733
same thing-- remember the other
day?

15:22.733 --> 15:24.233
She can't get on the
plane.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.667
When you get in your
own head, it's scary.

15:26.667 --> 15:34.067
And you don't want to let it get
to the next step like Kendall.

15:42.833 --> 15:46.633
What a life-changer that
you got rid of the camel drapes.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.833
Yeah, but I'm not
sure if I like it.

15:48.833 --> 15:51.600
I love it.
This makes it, like, chicer.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.467
They couldn't be this camel
color with the lines in them.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.467
- You liked it all?
- Well, I mean, it

15:57.467 --> 15:59.467
was just... it was easy and it
looked finished, but...

15:59.467 --> 16:01.467
All of that was
here when I moved in.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.467
It looks cleaner, a
little brighter.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.467
It's not like you
really need to black this room

16:05.467 --> 16:07.467
out, so it doesn't really
matter.

16:07.467 --> 16:12.033
Yeah.
So, Scott, why on Earth are you

16:12.033 --> 16:14.200
hanging out with my mom, going
to tea parties and doing water

16:14.200 --> 16:16.200
- aerobics?
- First of all, it

16:16.200 --> 16:18.200
- wasn't a tea party.
- It was a tea party.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.000
It was "high tea."
Was Lisa Miles

16:21.000 --> 16:23.033
- there?
- A tea party...

16:23.033 --> 16:26.000
No, Lisa was at water aerobics.
Lisa wasn't at high tea, she was

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
- busy.
- She texted me for

16:28.000 --> 16:31.367
your number today.
Like, since when were you

16:31.367 --> 16:34.867
- interested in water aerobics?
- Yeah, that's a little

16:34.867 --> 16:36.867
- odd.
- You never worked

16:36.867 --> 16:39.367
out a day in your life since I
met you.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.833
The only difference
between them and all of you is

16:41.833 --> 16:43.867
they don't sit on their phones
the whole time.

16:43.867 --> 16:46.333
- Saggier skin?
- Their skin's a drop

16:46.333 --> 16:48.533
- saggier.
- Just so not like

16:48.533 --> 16:53.233
you.
Just not your, like, steez.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.533
I knew this whole
water aerobics thing was gonna

16:55.533 --> 16:57.800
come back and haunt me.
I mean, I didn't want to be,

16:57.800 --> 16:59.800
like, a full-blown cougar
stalker.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
It's definitely not the most
normal thing on the planet.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.800
So maybe I shouldn't hang out
with the cougar squad.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.933
I don't want you to
feel bad.

17:06.933 --> 17:09.600
- I think you do.
- I was just

17:09.600 --> 17:13.733
interested in what exactly goes
down.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.500
I don't know, listen,
I mean, we talked about...

17:16.500 --> 17:19.667
Menopause.
I'm just kidding.

17:27.067 --> 17:32.067
Tonight I am going

17:32.067 --> 17:35.700
to the launch of Skyspace L.A.,
and I'm super excited to go.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.867
It's really nice to have this
event here, just 'cause I don't

17:38.867 --> 17:42.300
have to travel alone.

17:42.300 --> 17:46.567
Hello, everybody, and welcome to

17:46.567 --> 17:50.567
OUE Skyspace L.A.
I am so excited to be here.

17:50.567 --> 17:53.733
I brought all my friends out and
we are gonna ride this slide,

17:53.733 --> 17:56.600
and we are so excited for Travis
Scott to perform.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.133
And, yeah, I just hope everyone
has an amazing time.

18:03.100 --> 18:06.000
You were perfect.
You did it.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.167
I'm gonna go on the
slide.

18:08.167 --> 18:11.567
I can't.

18:11.567 --> 18:14.933
Kendall!

18:14.933 --> 18:17.433
I'm coming!

18:17.433 --> 18:19.767
- I hate it, I hate...
- I got you going down,

18:19.767 --> 18:21.800
- Kendall.
- I did it!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.400
How proud are you
of Kendall?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.200
Very proud.
I'm really glad to just spend

18:26.200 --> 18:28.233
some time with Kendall at her
event.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.767
We both travel so much, but she
has a few days here in L.A., so

18:31.767 --> 18:35.033
I'm glad to just be here and
watch her do her thing.

18:35.033 --> 18:38.633
- Pretty view.
- God, I'm so tired.

18:38.633 --> 18:41.133
You are?
What's been going on?

18:41.133 --> 18:43.967
This stupid sleep
paralysis thing is, like, really

18:43.967 --> 18:46.400
- getting to me.
- Sleep paralysis?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.233
- What is that?
- It's, like, you're

18:48.233 --> 18:51.567
asleep and then, like, the
middle of the night, basically

18:51.567 --> 18:54.333
your mind wakes up but your
body's still asleep.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.800
So, like, you wake up, but
nothing can move.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.467
- You can't speak, nothing.
- Wait, what?

18:59.467 --> 19:01.133
- Who's had this?
- Me. It's the

19:01.133 --> 19:02.600
It's the scariest thing in the
entire world.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.067
You literally think you're never
gonna be able to...

19:04.067 --> 19:05.467
And you can't pull
your body up, right?

19:05.467 --> 19:07.033
You can't do
anything.

19:07.033 --> 19:08.633
You're freaking out.
Like, cause all you want to do

19:08.633 --> 19:10.567
is be able to move.
So you're laying there, and

19:10.567 --> 19:12.300
you're trying to move, but I
think the key is to try and

19:12.300 --> 19:14.067
- relax.
- And you can't

19:14.067 --> 19:15.733
- communicate?
- Nothing.

19:15.733 --> 19:18.300
I mean, I thought I was
having anxiety.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.167
This is, like, so much scarier.
I've never heard of sleep

19:22.167 --> 19:25.967
paralysis, and I think it sounds
like such a crazy experience.

19:25.967 --> 19:29.233
And I feel so bad that she has
been going through this.

19:29.233 --> 19:32.033
This is the most
chilled out green room.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.700
Mm-hmm.
- Go to sleep, Kendall.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.467
- Take a nap.
- Yeah, I only got,

19:37.467 --> 19:40.033
- like, two hours of sleep.
- Me, too.

19:40.033 --> 19:41.733
It's been months living like
that.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.833
- So annoying.
- Kim, how do you do that?

19:43.833 --> 19:46.433
- I would die.
- I know. It's so...

19:46.433 --> 19:49.400
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

19:58.800 --> 20:02.000
Hey, how are you?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.100
- What's happening?
- Good.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.033
- The house looks great.
- Just hanging around

20:06.033 --> 20:07.633
in a gown.
I like it.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.467
It matches the tones of the
walls.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.600
I just wanted to point
out, she said I was kicking her

20:11.600 --> 20:13.267
out, and she made me feel guilty
about it.

20:13.267 --> 20:15.133
Every single time she
comes...

20:15.133 --> 20:17.133
Well, just don't make
me feel guilty.

20:19.133 --> 20:20.833
- Should we go sit down?
- Yeah, we can go over

20:20.833 --> 20:23.767
- here.
- So you called me the

20:23.767 --> 20:26.267
other day to ask me a question,
and you just seemed very

20:26.267 --> 20:28.300
- anxious.
- Yeah.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.267
And I don't know where
it's coming from.

20:30.267 --> 20:33.267
Kendall has got the same thing--
remember the other day?

20:33.267 --> 20:34.700
She can't get on the
plane.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.100
She thinks that, you
know, like, she wakes up...

20:36.100 --> 20:37.500
- She told me about it.
- It's awful.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.933
I mean, I'll never forget flying
to Paris to fly home with her.

20:40.933 --> 20:44.033
It was almost like she jumped on
me and, like, fell asleep

20:44.033 --> 20:46.433
cuddling because she was so
happy to have me there on the

20:46.433 --> 20:49.367
plane.
She could finally relax.

20:49.367 --> 20:55.333
So I think that she feels very
scared and not in control of her

20:55.333 --> 20:57.400
- situation.
- I'm in control.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.867
And you're feeling not
in control.

20:58.867 --> 21:01.500
- Emotionally.
- My mind does go crazy.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.767
When you get in your
own head, it's scary.

21:03.767 --> 21:06.133
And you don't want to let it get
to the next step, like...

21:06.133 --> 21:08.200
- Kendall's at the next step.
- Yeah.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.200
And that's
debilitating, because she can't

21:10.200 --> 21:13.567
do what she needs to do and she
can't live life.

21:13.567 --> 21:17.100
- Yeah.
- It's really ironic that

21:17.100 --> 21:20.767
Kim and Kendall are going
through similar things.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.700
Maybe there's a way that they
could help each other manage

21:23.700 --> 21:26.567
their anxiety so that they
would feel like they had the

21:26.567 --> 21:29.500
support of one another.
I think that we should find

21:29.500 --> 21:34.933
somebody for you two to talk to
so that this doesn't get bigger

21:34.933 --> 21:39.767
than it already is.
What happened to you?

21:39.767 --> 21:42.033
I had to go to, like,
this closing for a house that

21:42.033 --> 21:44.367
- I'm buying.
- It definitely bugged me

21:44.367 --> 21:47.433
- that you didn't show up.
- Mimic the panic

21:47.433 --> 21:49.000
- attack symptoms...
- Oh.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.267
...when you're
just kind of calm like this.

21:51.267 --> 21:58.067
Oh, my God, no, this
is so scary. Okay, pass.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.933
Hey.

22:07.933 --> 22:11.633
Hey, what happened to
you?

22:11.633 --> 22:15.233
Um, I had to go to,
like, this closing for a house

22:15.233 --> 22:19.667
- that I'm buying.
- Well, it definitely

22:19.667 --> 22:22.267
bugged me that you didn't show
up.

22:22.267 --> 22:24.400
Kris asked me if I
wanted to come over and eat with

22:24.400 --> 22:26.433
her friends.
You know, I definitely know it's

22:26.433 --> 22:29.800
not cool to flake on anybody,
but I guess I gotta start

22:29.800 --> 22:32.533
hanging out with some people my
own age.

22:32.533 --> 22:35.133
I had a place for you.
We sat there waiting.

22:35.133 --> 22:38.033
And we were looking forward to
you coming, you know, it's just

22:38.033 --> 22:40.967
manners to call somebody and
say, "Hey," or, you know, pop me

22:40.967 --> 22:44.200
a text and tell me something
came up because I was counting

22:44.200 --> 22:46.167
- on it.
- I mean, I guess I'll

22:46.167 --> 22:49.667
- know now for the future.
- All right, kiddo.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.300
Well, I'll see you soon and I
love you.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.733
Okay, all right.
I love you.

22:52.733 --> 22:55.267
- Okay, bye.
- All right, bye.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.767
- Do you want a muffin?
- No.

23:04.767 --> 23:08.600
Um, are you going to
France on, uh, Friday?

23:08.600 --> 23:11.267
I don't know, man.
I'm afraid to, like, get on a

23:11.267 --> 23:13.033
plane.
It's so crazy.

23:13.033 --> 23:15.200
I'm, like, supposed to be gone
and, like, traveling.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.933
- And like...
- You can do it.

23:16.933 --> 23:23.933
Ah!

23:23.933 --> 23:25.467
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.100
I'm good, how are you?
I'm Michelle.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.600
- Good. Hi, I'm Kim.
- Nice to meet you.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.867
Nice to meet you.
Here, we can go over here.

23:31.867 --> 23:36.067
My mom found this therapist
who specializes in anxiety.

23:36.067 --> 23:38.600
Since Kendall and I really
aren't therapy people, I think

23:38.600 --> 23:41.667
it's better for us to do it
together and just see if it

23:41.667 --> 23:43.933
helps us.
I mean, I really pride myself

23:43.933 --> 23:47.300
in, like, fully having my
together all the time.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.267
And with how bad things are for
Kendall, she has to get this

23:51.267 --> 23:53.867
under control.
This is Kendall.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.300
- Kendall, this is Michelle.
- Hi.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.500
Hi. Nice to meet
you, Michelle.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.967
- How are you?
- I'm good, how are

23:57.967 --> 23:59.300
- you?
- We're anxious.

23:59.300 --> 24:00.867
Well, good thing
I'm here.

24:00.867 --> 24:03.867
So I guess I just want to kind
of get to know a little bit

24:03.867 --> 24:06.867
about what typically makes you
guys anxious.

24:06.867 --> 24:09.200
Sometimes, I
literally randomly get panic

24:09.200 --> 24:12.800
attacks when I'm flying or
traveling or by myself.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.133
Mm-hmm.
- Mainly on planes,

24:14.133 --> 24:15.867
though.
Like, I had a crazy panic attack

24:15.867 --> 24:18.667
and I was FaceTiming my mom
crying, like, on the plane.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.333
And, like, I have weird sleep
paralysis happen to me when I'm

24:21.333 --> 24:23.267
on planes now.
And this is all new.

24:23.267 --> 24:25.033
So I'm, like... I don't even
know if there's a way around any

24:25.033 --> 24:26.600
- of it.
- There's not a

24:26.600 --> 24:28.867
whole lot you can do, like,
sort of in the moment.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.000
It's kind of riding the wave.
It's more about sort of

24:31.000 --> 24:33.400
preparing yourself.
And so there's coping skills.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.333
One of my favorite ones is
something called "interceptive

24:35.333 --> 24:38.333
exposure."
Basically just trying to mimic

24:38.333 --> 24:42.367
the panic attack symptoms when
you're just kind of calm like

24:42.367 --> 24:44.367
- this.
- Oh.

24:44.367 --> 24:47.133
The theory behind
it is that if you know what a

24:47.133 --> 24:50.167
panic attack is and you know how
to calm yourself down, you're

24:50.167 --> 24:52.467
less likely to have a panic
attack and they're less scary

24:52.467 --> 24:54.133
- when you're having them.
- Oh, my God, no, this

24:54.133 --> 24:57.867
is so scary. Okay, pass.
I'm not about to, like,

24:57.867 --> 25:02.433
actually... oh, my God, no.
The therapist is trying to get

25:02.433 --> 25:05.033
me to make a panic attack
happen.

25:05.033 --> 25:07.700
But every time I think about my
anxiety at all, it only makes it

25:07.700 --> 25:09.667
worse.
I want to get this under

25:09.667 --> 25:14.733
- control, but not like this.
- So I'm gonna have

25:14.733 --> 25:16.967
you tell me what thoughts are
going through your head.

25:16.967 --> 25:19.800
I'm kind of nervous to
induce my anxiety.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.233
Since you avoid
driving near the center divider,

25:22.233 --> 25:25.533
let's get all the way over.

25:25.533 --> 25:27.167
Hi. Did you cancel
everything?

25:27.167 --> 25:28.800
- Cancel everything?
- Yeah. Like...

25:28.800 --> 25:30.400
Are you kidding me?
Everybody's booked and they're

25:30.400 --> 25:31.733
counting on you.
These people are gonna lose

25:31.733 --> 25:33.633
their minds.

25:37.167 --> 25:40.733
If you know what a
panic attack is and you know how

25:40.733 --> 25:42.933
to calm yourself down, you're
less likely to have a panic

25:42.933 --> 25:45.267
attack and they're less scary
when you're having them.

25:45.267 --> 25:49.133
Oh, my God, no, this
is so scary. Okay, pass.

25:49.133 --> 25:52.667
I'm not about to, like,
actually... oh, my God, no.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.400
Just remind
yourself when you're on that

25:54.400 --> 25:57.200
plane that it will end.
You're not dying.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.533
Um... my anxiety's
really different.

26:01.533 --> 26:06.233
Like, if I get in a car, I'm
like, what if I drive, like, you

26:06.233 --> 26:08.433
know, on this side of the
freeway and then a car flips

26:08.433 --> 26:11.433
over and hits me this way?
I mean, I'm always afraid of a

26:11.433 --> 26:14.333
car accident.
Like, always.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.300
Do you think you
think about that more often than

26:16.300 --> 26:18.433
- the average person?
- Yeah, definitely.

26:18.433 --> 26:22.300
Yeah.
Any idea why?

26:22.300 --> 26:25.933
I don't know.
I think about it all the time.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.600
Mm-hmm.
- Like, it drives me

26:27.600 --> 26:30.000
- crazy.
- The interesting

26:30.000 --> 26:32.267
thing about anxiety disorders is
even though they're all

26:32.267 --> 26:34.367
different symptoms-- so you have
the panic attacks and you just

26:34.367 --> 26:38.000
sit here and ruminate-- the
treatment is very similar.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.433
We could take a drive, we
could... I could show you what

26:39.433 --> 26:41.567
that might look like.
We can, like, key...

26:41.567 --> 26:43.267
I'm not gonna go for
that.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.933
We're gonna spin
you in the car.

26:44.933 --> 26:46.267
- Does that work for you?
- Okay.

26:46.267 --> 26:47.600
Yeah, does that
work?

26:47.600 --> 26:48.933
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

26:48.933 --> 26:50.467
All righty then, I'm
gonna go home.

26:50.467 --> 26:51.800
Well, thank you.
Nice to meet you.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.600
You're welcome.
You, too.

26:53.600 --> 26:57.533
I know this is really
difficult for Kendall, but I am

26:57.533 --> 27:03.600
disappointed, 'cause I feel like
it's fixable if she works on it.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.400
- Okay.
- So what we're

27:06.400 --> 27:10.200
trying to accomplish is
experiencing those thoughts.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.567
So I'm gonna have you tell me
what thoughts are going through

27:12.567 --> 27:16.833
- your head as we're driving.
- I'm kind of nervous to

27:16.833 --> 27:20.900
induce my anxiety, but if it's,
like, an exercise that she

27:20.900 --> 27:23.500
thinks will help, I'm totally
willing to try it.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.767
I just want to get past my
anxiety and figure out a way

27:26.767 --> 27:29.600
just to live life like I was
before.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.733
I just heard a story about,
like, kids that threw a rock in

27:32.733 --> 27:37.167
a window, and, like, the woman
that they hit is brain-damaged.

27:37.167 --> 27:39.500
Mm-hmm.
- And then I'm like, "Ugh,

27:39.500 --> 27:42.033
that could be anyone."
It, like, breaks my heart.

27:42.033 --> 27:44.267
Mm-hmm. You know
the average person doesn't think

27:44.267 --> 27:46.900
that way, right?
Yeah, okay. Just checking.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.400
Well, we call these intrusive
thoughts-- they're just pop-ins.

27:49.400 --> 27:53.833
They-they jump in your head and
is related to being responsible

27:53.833 --> 27:55.833
for another human being.
And that's scary.

27:55.833 --> 27:57.833
That's overwhelming to a lot of
moms.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.833
- Yeah.
- So if you can,

27:59.833 --> 28:02.633
since you typically avoid
driving near the center divider,

28:02.633 --> 28:05.533
if we can get over, my
suggestion is let's get all the

28:05.533 --> 28:11.167
- way over.
- Okay.

28:11.167 --> 28:14.533
So are you having
any thoughts that you'll get hit

28:14.533 --> 28:16.533
- or anything like that?
- A little bit.

28:16.533 --> 28:18.733
- A little bit. Yeah.
- It's just more like I'm

28:18.733 --> 28:21.433
extra aware what those cars are
doing.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.100
Mm-hmm. So... And
do you ever tell yourself, like,

28:24.100 --> 28:26.300
"No, I'll be fine" or anything
like that?

28:26.300 --> 28:28.633
No, it just... I let it
pass.

28:28.633 --> 28:31.433
Good. That's really
what you want to do, and that's

28:31.433 --> 28:34.200
generally what I teach people to
do, is really just tolerating

28:34.200 --> 28:37.533
those thoughts.
It's like, try not to be super

28:37.533 --> 28:41.267
aware that... you know, it's
that fine line between, um,

28:41.267 --> 28:44.733
being hypervigilant and-and kind
of living your normal life,

28:44.733 --> 28:50.567
making sure I'm aware of what's
going on and then also, like,

28:50.567 --> 28:55.400
not changing my behaviors too
much for that.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.767
I mean, I never had
anxiety.

28:57.767 --> 29:00.100
I've never really had anything
to where I've not really been in

29:00.100 --> 29:05.100
control and so, I think this is
just, like, a slipup and I have

29:05.100 --> 29:09.100
- to take back my life.
- Yes, all of these

29:09.100 --> 29:13.100
bad things could happen, um,
but again, we don't want to

29:13.100 --> 29:15.100
necessarily change our lives
because of it.

29:15.100 --> 29:27.667
Totally.â™ª â™ª

29:27.667 --> 29:29.900
Oh, Scott, Scott,
Scott.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.267
That's me.
Mm-hmm.

29:32.267 --> 29:34.400
First of all, I love
your shorts.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.067
- Thanks.
- And secondly, what

29:36.067 --> 29:38.733
- happened to your leg?
- I fell off a scooter.

29:38.733 --> 29:41.667
- What scooter?
- One of Mason's.

29:41.667 --> 29:43.333
- That's really bad.
- I don't

29:43.333 --> 29:45.333
want to talk about it.
I was ridiculous.

29:45.333 --> 29:49.000
Anyway... I heard that
you are now flaking hanging out

29:49.000 --> 29:51.367
with Kris Jenner.

29:51.367 --> 29:53.367
I just think it's
getting a little bit weird that

29:53.367 --> 29:55.800
I'm with her and her friends,
like, every other day.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.267
- Who cares?
- Going to dinner, going

29:57.267 --> 29:59.633
to lunches, pool exercising,
pool aerobics, I mean, what's

29:59.633 --> 30:01.133
- next?
- But aren't you having

30:01.133 --> 30:02.333
- fun with her?
- Totally!

30:02.333 --> 30:04.267
But Kourtney kind of gave me a
little  about it.

30:04.267 --> 30:05.633
'Cause Kourtney's a
hater.

30:05.633 --> 30:06.967
It's not only
Kourtney.

30:06.967 --> 30:08.467
- Was it Nancy?
- Nance.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.600
- Nancy.
- Fancy Nancy AKA Kimmy

30:10.600 --> 30:13.633
K has been bothering me, too.
Like, "Why are you always with

30:13.633 --> 30:15.667
my mom, and all of her friends,
and all the..."

30:15.667 --> 30:17.667
- Why do you care?
- Maybe I'm liking it

30:17.667 --> 30:20.433
- too much and I'm scared.
- I think my mom is

30:20.433 --> 30:22.767
super cool.
I love her friends and I know

30:22.767 --> 30:25.400
that all of us, especially
Kourt, would agree that my mom

30:25.400 --> 30:28.633
and her friends are definitely a
better influence for Scott than

30:28.633 --> 30:31.800
some of his other friends.
It's, like, a great, positive...

30:31.800 --> 30:34.733
thing for him to be around.
I feel like you're more freaked

30:34.733 --> 30:36.300
out 'cause you feel like you're
going to cougar town.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.867
- Like, it's fine.
- Right.

30:37.867 --> 30:39.567
I really think you're
being crazy, and I think that

30:39.567 --> 30:41.633
you should appreciate that
you're a hit and that these old

30:41.633 --> 30:44.567
broads love you.
And also, like, if we were to

30:44.567 --> 30:49.933
compare to who you were hanging
out with prior to, like... these

30:49.933 --> 30:52.667
broads, I think you're doing
pretty well.

30:52.667 --> 30:56.333
Listen, I-I agree.
I'd rather be hanging out with

30:56.333 --> 30:58.200
your mom and her friends than
people that don't actually care

30:58.200 --> 30:59.867
- about me.
- Right.

30:59.867 --> 31:02.367
They are fun.
You actually bring up a good

31:02.367 --> 31:05.133
point.
You know, I definitely do feel

31:05.133 --> 31:07.467
bad about pushing Kris and her
friends away, 'cause I know that

31:07.467 --> 31:09.733
they were only trying to be
there for me, and I feel like

31:09.733 --> 31:13.067
she always has been and I really
have a nice time with them.

31:13.067 --> 31:15.033
I shouldn't be scared to admit
it.

31:15.033 --> 31:16.700
You got to hang out
with the cougars.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.633
I like the cougs.
Trust me, I do.

31:18.633 --> 31:22.033
- You keep them young.
- Forever young.

31:22.033 --> 31:24.567
- Forever sprung.
- Ew.

31:24.567 --> 31:26.800
- Hi, my baby.
- Off of me.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.167
She's a nice girl.
You let other girls lick you,

31:29.167 --> 31:31.767
- why not her?
- Excuse me?

31:31.767 --> 31:34.600
My baby.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.467
Look how cute this
picture is of your dad and me

31:47.467 --> 31:50.733
and Auntie Joyce and Uncle
Larry.

31:50.733 --> 31:52.867
It's almost like we were all
color-coordinated.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.267
Saint kind of looks like
Robert.

31:55.267 --> 31:57.567
- Robert, your brother?
Mm-hmm.

31:57.567 --> 32:01.167
It's so wild how
fashion has so much to do with

32:01.167 --> 32:03.167
the memories.
It's like, I remember that

32:03.167 --> 32:06.500
outfit.
101

32:06.500 --> 32:09.067
sweater.
Like, out in public and it

32:09.067 --> 32:11.867
wasn't Halloween.
Oh, my God, look at your dad.

32:11.867 --> 32:14.467
That's a major 'stache.

32:14.467 --> 32:17.100
Don't you, like, wonder,
like, what would our lives be

32:17.100 --> 32:19.367
like, though, if my dad was
here?

32:19.367 --> 32:21.633
Like, don't you think our lives
would've been, like, so

32:21.633 --> 32:24.700
- different?
- I think about it all

32:24.700 --> 32:29.333
the time because I feel like, in
some way, he is still here.

32:29.333 --> 32:34.700
Your lives would be fuller, for
sure.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.967
He would be so proud of you guys
right now.

32:36.967 --> 32:39.200
- He totally would.
- He would be so...

32:39.200 --> 32:40.467
He would be, like,
really excited...

32:40.467 --> 32:42.533
- ...impressed.
- ...that, like, Rob is...

32:42.533 --> 32:46.767
ventured back over and everyone
is, like, all together.

32:46.767 --> 32:51.833
- Getting along.
Mm-hmm.

32:51.833 --> 32:54.933
My dad lived his life to
the fullest and I have all these

32:54.933 --> 32:57.367
photos now that I could look
back at.

32:57.367 --> 33:02.267
I know he never lived in fear
and I don't want to ruin all of

33:02.267 --> 33:07.900
the memories for my kids because
of my own anxiety.

33:07.900 --> 33:12.167
The last thing my dad said to me
was, "I know you'll be okay and

33:12.167 --> 33:15.333
you are strong."
So, I would never want to not

33:15.333 --> 33:16.433
live up to that.

33:20.267 --> 33:24.300
My motto has always just
been, like, take control of your

33:24.300 --> 33:26.300
own life.
So, I think that it's really

33:26.300 --> 33:33.233
good if we just, like, try
meditating.

33:41.567 --> 33:44.800
Look how he set up over
here for the painting.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.567
- Hi! How are you?
- Good, how are you?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.233
Wine and cheese,
ladies?

33:49.233 --> 33:51.067
- Love that.
- This is so cute.

33:51.067 --> 33:52.933
Let's definitely
grab some wine. Right?

33:52.933 --> 33:54.367
- Definitely.
- 'Cause that helps,

33:54.367 --> 33:55.433
- for sure.
- Okay.

33:55.433 --> 33:56.700
We're putting our
aprons on?

33:56.700 --> 33:58.067
â™ª Aprons. â™ª
Please, put your

33:58.067 --> 33:59.500
- aprons on.
- Oh, hello.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.167
What's shaking?

34:02.167 --> 34:03.500
What are you doing
here?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.100
- We're painting.
- Coming to painting

34:05.100 --> 34:06.867
class.
Are you crazy?

34:06.867 --> 34:08.300
- Oh.
- I'm not gonna miss out

34:08.300 --> 34:10.767
on this.
Okay.

34:10.767 --> 34:13.300
I've gone back and
forth thinking about if I'm

34:13.300 --> 34:15.967
gonna hang out with these lovely
women or not... and the truth

34:15.967 --> 34:18.033
is, I don't care what people
think.

34:18.033 --> 34:21.967
Age really is just a number and
I love all these ladies, so...

34:21.967 --> 34:24.500
I'm not gonna break bonds with
these people that have only been

34:24.500 --> 34:27.000
there for me.
And, you know, these ladies need

34:27.000 --> 34:28.633
the Lord.
Can I have a little bit?

34:28.633 --> 34:29.900
Do you guys have an
extra easel, by any chance?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.333
- We do.
- Of course they do.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.067
So, here's the base.
Kind of a slight little smiley

34:33.067 --> 34:35.033
face.
You see how I kind of angled it?

34:35.033 --> 34:37.233
- Yeah.
- Just do that.

34:37.233 --> 34:38.667
- Wow!
- Wow!

34:38.667 --> 34:41.133
I like this color.
That is a nice palette you got

34:41.133 --> 34:42.533
- there. That is nice.
- Yeah, are you sure?

34:42.533 --> 34:44.333
That's sweet, that's
like a teal.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.733
Right.
I would almost go with a nice

34:45.733 --> 34:47.267
- turquoise.
Mm-hmm.

34:47.267 --> 34:48.667
- Okay.
- Beautiful. Beautiful

34:48.667 --> 34:50.033
- little line up.
- Are you seriously

34:50.033 --> 34:51.533
gonna, like, build a studio in
your house?

34:51.533 --> 34:53.133
Is that gonna be the next thing
that you're gonna do?

34:53.133 --> 34:54.700
I'm thinking about...
well, I'm gonna have Scott do

34:54.700 --> 34:56.167
- it.
- Oh, it's gonna go in

34:56.167 --> 34:57.467
- Scott's house, huh?
- Yeah, he lives right

34:57.467 --> 34:58.833
- down the street.
- You're gonna have

34:58.833 --> 35:00.000
- the artist's studio?
- No idea.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.933
Why don't you do
sculpting and do that scene from

35:01.933 --> 35:04.000
where you, like, build
that big, phallic symbol?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.200
Oh, we could do
sculpting next!

35:05.200 --> 35:07.500
- Right.
- Can somebody make me

35:07.500 --> 35:08.800
- some green?
- I'll make you some

35:08.800 --> 35:10.400
- green.
- I need some green!

35:10.400 --> 35:13.533
- I need olive green.
- Oh, you're doing a

35:13.533 --> 35:16.500
very, very nice little job over
there, I'm not gonna lie.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.367
Ta-da!
- Beautiful.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.033
- Beautiful, guys!
- Yay!

35:22.033 --> 35:24.733
- Oh, that's pretty.
- Thanks for coming,

35:24.733 --> 35:26.800
Scott.
I love having you in the class.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.200
- Oh, yeah.
- That made it fun.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.700
Just one of the girls,
you know?

35:29.700 --> 35:31.700
Yeah, well, you look
good in a dress.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.767
Thanks.
I also wanted to say, I'm sorry

35:34.767 --> 35:36.933
I didn't meet you guys the other
day for lunch.

35:36.933 --> 35:39.467
I feel bad that I flaked on you.
Now I'm thinking, I'm like, it's

35:39.467 --> 35:43.600
better this than something else.
So that's why I came today, I

35:43.600 --> 35:45.300
was like, I miss hanging out
with everybody.

35:45.300 --> 35:49.533
You live a very tiny
life on Earth and enjoy yourself

35:49.533 --> 35:51.433
- and do what makes you happy.
- That's totally true.

35:51.433 --> 35:53.167
And how much fun did we
have?

35:53.167 --> 35:55.333
Listen, we have a nice
little time for ourselves.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.700
- A nice little time.
- I love you. I love you.

36:09.067 --> 36:13.400
I hate
this ottoman with a passion.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.500
Like...
It's pretty gross.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.000
I honestly cannot
stand it.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.367
- Hi!
- Hello.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.500
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey, how are you?

36:32.500 --> 36:35.300
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.500
I've had no anxiety on
the road.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.300
- That's awesome.
- You know what's funny?

36:39.300 --> 36:42.000
Now that I think about it, I
really haven't had anxiety since

36:42.000 --> 36:44.033
- I saw you.
- Like no bull.

36:44.033 --> 36:46.033
That's amazing.
I cured you.

36:46.033 --> 36:49.700
- Yeah, I think you did.
- There is no cure

36:49.700 --> 36:52.233
for anxiety.
And the thing is sometimes when

36:52.233 --> 36:54.967
people talk about this stuff and
kind of get educated about where

36:54.967 --> 36:58.567
the thoughts are coming from,
there's a calming quality in

36:58.567 --> 37:00.433
- that.
- Yeah, totally.

37:00.433 --> 37:03.000
I have, like, a little bit more
of, like, a handle.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.233
Like, I just-- it's not freaking
me out as much.

37:05.233 --> 37:08.733
That's good.
And, uh, how's Kendall doing?

37:08.733 --> 37:11.833
She's the same.
And she's supposed to fly out

37:11.833 --> 37:14.967
for work in a couple of days.
Like, that's when she gets her

37:14.967 --> 37:17.000
- anxiety, so...
- Right. Right,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.833
right, right, on the plane.
You can also just do simple,

37:19.833 --> 37:22.667
like, breathing exercises.
So, you know, do meditation or

37:22.667 --> 37:26.767
- mindfulness.
- Yeah, maybe.

37:26.767 --> 37:30.967
I got such a good control over
my anxiety, I want that for

37:30.967 --> 37:34.300
Kendall and I want her to really
work on it cause Kendall's been

37:34.300 --> 37:39.067
staying in L.A. and living in
this anxiety fear about

37:39.067 --> 37:42.567
traveling, and that's not really
realistic for her career.

37:42.567 --> 37:50.167
I don't think this has to get
the best of her.

37:56.433 --> 37:59.067
Think I hate
bodysuits more than anything.

37:59.067 --> 38:00.833
- Hmm?
- I said I hate

38:00.833 --> 38:03.800
bodysuits more than anything.
I'm too long for them.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.600
Wait, do you like what I
did to my phone, seriously?

38:05.600 --> 38:06.667
- Yeah.
- Isn't it cute?

38:06.667 --> 38:08.333
- Yeah.
- Cause I wanted, like, a

38:08.333 --> 38:12.967
KIMOJI case but, like, a LuMee
case so I put stickers.

38:12.967 --> 38:16.933
So what's so crazy is that I
literally haven't had anxiety.

38:16.933 --> 38:18.600
- That's crazy.
- Haven't even thought

38:18.600 --> 38:20.167
- about it.
Mm-hmm.

38:20.167 --> 38:23.833
But I also think that
everybody handles things in

38:23.833 --> 38:25.767
different ways.
So I think maybe it's really

38:25.767 --> 38:27.867
good if we just, like, try
meditating, you know?

38:27.867 --> 38:30.333
I'll kind of like let you do
your thing since I've tried

38:30.333 --> 38:33.067
meditating, it's not my thing.
I think actually talking to the

38:33.067 --> 38:36.633
girl was more my thing.
As a way to try to help Kendall,

38:36.633 --> 38:40.233
I set up a meditation for her
and I just to have this, like,

38:40.233 --> 38:43.833
little session.
Some people live by it.

38:43.833 --> 38:46.700
And because, you know, there is
no cure for anxiety.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.500
Like, you have to get control of
your feelings.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.700
Unless you want to change your
job and do something totally

38:51.700 --> 38:54.367
different, which you don't.
So I feel like you just have to,

38:54.367 --> 38:58.567
like... get ahold of it, you
know what I mean?

38:58.567 --> 39:00.000
- Yeah.
- I'll bring you out

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
there, you know, you can just
see if you like it.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.767
Okay.
I'm into it.

39:05.767 --> 39:08.400
- So let's go.
- I do feel like Kim

39:08.400 --> 39:10.533
is right, 'cause I do love my
career.

39:10.533 --> 39:13.167
And I love being able to travel
the world and I feel blessed.

39:13.167 --> 39:15.800
This is the lifestyle I want to
live, so meditation's something

39:15.800 --> 39:19.100
that I'm willing to try just to
kind of cope with it.

39:19.100 --> 39:22.700
- How serene is this?
- Oh, wow, are you

39:22.700 --> 39:25.200
- trying to hold my hand?
- No.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.400
- Hello.
- How are you?

39:27.400 --> 39:29.000
Hi, good, I'm
Heather.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.500
- Hi, I'm Kim.
- Kim, nice to meet

39:30.500 --> 39:31.900
- you.
- Hi, I'm Kendall.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.267
- Nice to meet you.
- Ooh, what is this?

39:34.267 --> 39:37.000
So what we're gonna
do is we're gonna start with

39:37.000 --> 39:39.567
just learning to watch the mind
a little bit.

39:39.567 --> 39:44.267
So now getting into a posture.
Whatever's comfortable for you.

39:44.267 --> 39:47.867
So the thinking mind tells us
what to do all day.

39:47.867 --> 39:51.533
So for this moment in time what
we're doing is we're dropping

39:51.533 --> 39:54.767
into our wisdom mind.
Just dropping that question,

39:54.767 --> 39:58.133
"What do you need?"
Asking the heart.

39:58.133 --> 40:01.933
Developing another voice rather
than that inner thinker, we can

40:01.933 --> 40:05.933
have that compassionate voice
saying, "I'm here to give you

40:05.933 --> 40:11.100
comfort.
I'm here to listen to you.

40:11.100 --> 40:16.467
I'm here, you're safe."
We can create that inner soother

40:16.467 --> 40:19.767
to help care for our heart, our
body and our mind.

40:19.767 --> 40:24.100
We just slowly begin to
strengthen this muscle allowing

40:24.100 --> 40:27.567
ourselves to give ourselves
care.

40:27.567 --> 40:35.267
And when we're ready, gently
opening the eyes.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.633
Well, you had a lot of
stillness.

40:37.633 --> 40:39.133
- Really?
- Yes, that was great.

40:39.133 --> 40:40.400
Is that a good
thing?

40:40.400 --> 40:41.700
Yes, that's a really
good thing.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.800
- There was a lot of stillness.
- I feel like I zoned

40:43.800 --> 40:45.400
- out.
- That's a good thing,

40:45.400 --> 40:47.067
- right?
- Yeah. No, I loved

40:47.067 --> 40:48.833
- it.
- Good, yay.

40:48.833 --> 40:52.200
Thank you.
It's pretty amazing because this

40:52.200 --> 40:55.067
is definitely making me, like,
relax a little bit and find some

40:55.067 --> 40:59.300
peace.
And knowing that having anxiety

40:59.300 --> 41:02.833
isn't something that you can
just fix and it'll go away,

41:02.833 --> 41:05.300
meditation's definitely
something that could help me.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.333
It's something that I can
obviously take everywhere with

41:07.333 --> 41:09.400
me.
Whenever I feel like I need it.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.033
So we can do those
practices when we're not anxious

41:12.033 --> 41:14.733
and still bring in that
compassioned voice even when

41:14.733 --> 41:17.233
- things are really stressful.
- Well, thank you.

41:17.233 --> 41:18.667
You're welcome,
thank you.

41:18.667 --> 41:20.567
Thank you.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.933
What are these
juices?

41:35.933 --> 41:37.833
Take whatever.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.367
- Ugh.
- You know what's weird is

41:45.367 --> 41:47.600
I usually don't like meditating,
but I kind of liked it.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.867
Yeah.
I feel like I should tell Mom.

41:49.867 --> 41:53.367
Oh, my God, call Mom and
be like, "We have to cancel.

41:53.367 --> 41:55.167
I can't do it."
I already said that

41:55.167 --> 41:56.767
to her.
It's gonna be like, "Did you

41:56.767 --> 41:59.033
cancel it?"

41:59.033 --> 42:01.067
- Hey, Kendall.
- Hi, did you cancel

42:01.067 --> 42:04.033
- everything?
- Cancel everything?

42:04.033 --> 42:06.767
- Yeah, like...
- Are you kidding me?

42:06.767 --> 42:09.533
No, I didn't cancel anything,
Kendall.

42:09.533 --> 42:11.800
I mean, these people are gonna
lose their minds.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.600
Everybody's booked and they're
counting on you.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.100
Mom, chill, chill.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.700
- Why would I chill?
- Because I think I'll

42:17.700 --> 42:22.767
be okay.
I just did a meditation class

42:22.767 --> 42:25.700
and I feel like it might
actually help.

42:25.700 --> 42:28.033
- I really liked it.
- That's really cool.

42:28.033 --> 42:30.567
Do you think that you know how
to do that if you tried it again

42:30.567 --> 42:32.933
- on your own, Kendall?
- Yeah.

42:32.933 --> 42:35.667
Well, I'm proud of you
for doing that. That's awesome.

42:35.667 --> 42:38.000
Thanks.
Love you.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.433
All right.
I love you, too.

42:39.433 --> 42:41.267
I really don't think
I would've done it if you hadn't

42:41.267 --> 42:43.367
have made me do it, so, thank
you.

42:43.367 --> 42:47.867
Sometimes it's good to
be forced to do things.

42:47.867 --> 42:50.200
- On the next episode...
- I think it's crazy

42:50.200 --> 42:52.767
what's going on in the world and
I'm passionate about stricter

42:52.767 --> 42:54.500
- guns laws.
- If you get involved with

42:54.500 --> 42:57.133
that type of stuff, you're gonna
get a lot of hate.

42:57.133 --> 42:58.667
Where's the interview
person?

42:58.667 --> 43:03.400
We are doing the LEGACY video
with my mom, Mary Jo, and I'm

43:03.400 --> 43:06.633
nervous.
What's your biggest fear?

43:06.633 --> 43:09.600
I try not to fear.
What's your biggest fear?

43:09.600 --> 43:12.033
I
don't want to say it.

43:12.033 --> 43:15.200
Why did you ask me that?
I can't believe I'm crying.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.000
