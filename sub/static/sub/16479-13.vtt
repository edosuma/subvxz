WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:04.436
COMMENTATOR: They've scored five
touchdowns in this game...

00:04.438 --> 00:05.804
Wow. Check this out.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.172
Coach and May's
foreign exchange student

00:07.174 --> 00:08.807
just added me as a friend.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.776
Montsie.
His name is Montsie.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.611
I didn't know they had
a foreign exchange student.

00:12.613 --> 00:13.946
I didn't know they moved
to North Carolina.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.447
Neither did I.
(they laugh)

00:15.449 --> 00:17.282
They moved to North
Carol-- what?
Yeah.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.651
How did none of us know about
this? How is that possible?

00:19.653 --> 00:21.954
Eh, they moved. It happened.
We need to make
more of an effort.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.889
We don't even know that
our friend has moved

00:23.891 --> 00:25.224
to a different state.
I mean, we're still friends.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.992
We just have nothing
to do with each other.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.127
This doesn't bother you?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.461
Realistically, we'll
probably see 'em

00:29.463 --> 00:31.397
two or three more
times before we die.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.232
And it's sad, but it's
also not that sad.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.833
What?
Who cares? What's for dinner?

00:34.835 --> 00:36.235
I care.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.070
McKenna, please. Please,
don't do this. Okay? I mean,

00:38.072 --> 00:40.239
what about that formal swimwear
ad I got you? McKenna?

00:40.241 --> 00:42.007
McKen--?

00:42.009 --> 00:43.976
Well, guys! It happened again.

00:43.978 --> 00:46.979
A big agency stole
another one of my clients.

00:46.981 --> 00:49.415
And I have a big audition today.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.682
Gosh darn it. You know what?
CECE: Jess!

00:50.684 --> 00:52.084
Those pretty boys
don't deserve you.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.987
Which one is McKenna?
Is he the gaunt, heroin-hot one?

00:54.989 --> 00:57.089
That's Jean Francois.
He got poached last week.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.825
McKenna's the one that looked
like a jacked Bryant Gumbel.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.760
Oh...
And this is a huge deal!

01:01.762 --> 01:03.095
It's the Sausage
Crunchies account!

01:03.097 --> 01:04.396
Why would a dog food company

01:04.398 --> 01:07.066
be interested in a bunch
of hot models?

01:07.068 --> 01:07.900
Oh, no, it's, uh--
NICK: No, no, no.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.435
Sausage Crunchies
are people food.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.903
They're like brown
cheese snacks.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.905
Yeah, it's like space food.
I-I put them in soup.

01:12.907 --> 01:13.906
CECE:
I just really wanted to show

01:13.908 --> 01:15.774
this casting agency
that I was legit.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.743
Now, if I go down there
with just Donovan,

01:17.745 --> 01:19.411
I'm gonna look
like a no-name hustler.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.013
Gosh darn it.
Should I go out now and try

01:21.015 --> 01:22.681
to find new clients,
or should I concentrate

01:22.683 --> 01:24.917
on the one client
that I have left?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.452
You know, they're probably
sniffing around Donovan

01:26.454 --> 01:28.921
as we speak.
(gasps) Crap.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.255
Is that what he wants
to talk to me about?
Hey.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.857
He said he wanted to talk
to me about something.
Cece.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.125
Is that what he wanted
to talk to me about?
Cece, calm.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.126
These poachers.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.928
You concentrate on Donovan.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.097
I'll go see if I can drum up
some new clients.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.766
Very sweet, but the audition
is in six hours from now.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.534
So we have no time
to look for new clients.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.104
Well, recruiting is just
like sales, I mean selling a job

01:45.106 --> 01:47.239
is just like selling drugs.
I do that every day.

01:47.241 --> 01:50.642
Are you offering to help, too?

01:50.644 --> 01:51.743
Honestly, I wasn't.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.446
But based on how

01:54.448 --> 01:55.914
intensely you're staring at me,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.784
I guess I've boxed myself
into a corner here, so--

01:58.786 --> 02:00.953
Great! Okay.
You concentrate on Donovan.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.288
We'll get the models.
Heads in, guys.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.490
What?
"Heads in"?

02:04.492 --> 02:05.757
No. It's "hands in."

02:05.759 --> 02:06.758
I'm pretty sure it's "heads in."

02:06.760 --> 02:07.759
What are we supposed to do?

02:07.761 --> 02:08.760
Smoosh our heads together?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.762
Yeah.
Everybody. Hands in.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.830
Hands in.
Hands in.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.433
WINSTON:
Meow.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.601
SCHMIDT: Winston!
What?

02:15.603 --> 02:17.002
How are you not tired of this?

02:17.004 --> 02:18.170
Tired of what?

02:18.172 --> 02:20.239
♪ ♪

02:23.010 --> 02:26.645
Okay, model types, 3:00.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.946
Take a bow.

02:27.948 --> 02:28.914
Wait, those two oatmeal men?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.782
Follow my lead.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.918
How did we ever date
the same dude?

02:32.920 --> 02:33.986
(laughs): Hey!

02:33.988 --> 02:35.120
<i> Kampai.</i> That's Japanese

02:35.122 --> 02:37.422
for "What's up?"

02:37.424 --> 02:38.991
Hi! Jessica Day.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.125
What are we celebrating?

02:40.127 --> 02:42.161
Kirby here works
for a marine biologist.

02:42.163 --> 02:45.931
and he got them to name a new
species of sea slug after me.

02:45.933 --> 02:46.932
Oh!

02:46.934 --> 02:47.933
It's called Bruce's

02:47.935 --> 02:49.434
Eastern Sea Slug.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.602
You two are fascinating.
Have you ever

02:50.604 --> 02:51.770
considered modeling?

02:51.772 --> 02:52.838
KIRBY:
I actually have.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.606
Us?
A-A lot.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.308
I have a rich fantasy life.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.943
Oh.
I can't wait to hear
more about that.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.611
Sounds so great.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.446
What are you doing?
Those guys are obviously

03:01.448 --> 03:03.115
not model material.

03:03.117 --> 03:04.483
Because they're not
cookie-cutter hot?

03:04.485 --> 03:07.619
Cece needs a bunch
of different guys,

03:07.621 --> 03:08.854
so don't judge a book
by its cover.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.289
Except when you're
talking about models.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.824
Models exist to be on covers.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.059
I think that's
an oversimplification.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.994
I think the best models
have something

03:15.996 --> 03:17.462
to give them
a little personality.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.065
Something, something
that makes them stand apart.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.833
Like a gap in their lower teeth,

03:21.835 --> 03:23.635
or a neck nipple.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.404
You're making this
way too complicated.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.905
Look, this is all
it needs to be.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.907
You walk up to a hot guy, okay?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.008
And you say "Hey, you're hot.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.643
Do you want to be a model?"

03:31.645 --> 03:33.011
You have to forge
a connection with them.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.479
And that way they entrust us
with the thing

03:34.481 --> 03:36.081
that makes them
really beautiful.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.583
You know what?
You do your thing.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.917
I'll do my thing.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.586
But your thing cannot be

03:40.588 --> 03:42.421
going back to the slug guys.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.089
Sea slugs, Reagan.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.991
They're sea slug guys.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.027
But you're right.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.163
You're nasty about it,
but you're right.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.165
CECE:
<i> So, Donovan.</i>

03:53.167 --> 03:54.833
<i> You have something</i>
<i> you want to tell me?</i>

04:06.780 --> 04:09.348
(inhales, exhales)

04:11.185 --> 04:15.254
I've... made a big decision.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.588
No, Donovan, don't.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.357
I'm gonna stop wearing beanies.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.358
Wait, what?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.126
I think. I...

04:21.128 --> 04:23.362
That's what you wanted
to talk to me about?

04:23.364 --> 04:26.198
I thought some big agency
was trying to poach you.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.432
No. (chuckles)

04:27.434 --> 04:28.800
They've just been
sending me

04:28.802 --> 04:30.035
baskets and trying to take me

04:30.037 --> 04:32.104
to fancy dinners and stuff.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.272
What?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.606
They've just been
giving me baskets

04:34.608 --> 04:35.474
and trying--
Listen to me, okay?

04:35.476 --> 04:36.608
I know

04:36.610 --> 04:38.910
that gift baskets are great.

04:38.912 --> 04:39.911
Yeah.
They are.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.280
But once BGE signs you,

04:41.282 --> 04:42.781
there are no more baskets.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.750
Because they don't
care about you.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.119
All they care about are numbers.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.920
But you, Donovan,

04:48.922 --> 04:51.923
you are my first priority.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.091
So when you're with me,

04:53.093 --> 04:55.460
you will never feel neglected.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.962
Just tell me what you need.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.096
I got you.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.464
I need someone
to help me get better

04:59.466 --> 05:01.600
at tricks on my motorcycle.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.802
Sure.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.171
(grunts)
Mmm.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.173
I really hate these things.
I just can't stop eating 'em.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.441
I got to say,
the taste is average,

05:09.443 --> 05:12.110
but the aftertaste
is outstanding.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.279
What happens when I'm
just an outstanding aftertaste?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.981
Hmm?

05:15.983 --> 05:16.982
When I move out,
are you guys gonna

05:16.984 --> 05:18.150
forget about me like Coach?

05:18.152 --> 05:20.452
This loft is what
tethers us together.

05:20.454 --> 05:24.256
And once it's gone, we're gonna
be spread across the Earth

05:24.258 --> 05:25.924
like Rod Stewart's offspring.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.160
What I'm gonna miss most
about you is all this poetry.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.461
No, no, no.
You know what,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.263
do not give up
on us already.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.665
We just need to find something
that keeps us together.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.934
Like a dark secret
or a time-share.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.602
You know, it was easier
when men went to war.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.338
You'd forge an
unbreakable bond

05:39.340 --> 05:41.340
in a crucible of
blood and pain.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.975
You can't get that splitting
the cost of toilet paper.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.778
We just need to come up
with some sort of ritual.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.846
Yes! Now you're thinking.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.614
We stand in a circle, right?

05:49.616 --> 05:50.949
We burn chicken bones,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.534
all right?
Dear Lord, Winston.

05:52.535 --> 05:54.118
Then we're just secretive
about it.
This is the wrong ritual...

05:54.121 --> 05:55.187
I'm just saying
no one knows about it.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.122
I didn't literally mean
a ritual.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.124
Oh.
I just mean, like,
a shared experience,

05:59.126 --> 06:00.659
one that bonds us together.
I've been saying this

06:00.661 --> 06:02.661
for the longest time,
but I'm really ready

06:02.663 --> 06:05.664
to get super weird into metal
detectors if you guys are.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.732
That's, sure, that's one idea.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.733
You look for treasure.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.234
Nickels, dimes, quarters.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.569
If you find
enough, um,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.337
said treasure or change,

06:12.339 --> 06:14.072
supplement your income.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.240
It's also entertaining.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.641
While looking,
there's, uh,

06:16.643 --> 06:18.009
an endorphin rush.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.846
It's entertainment,
it's income... uh, ritual.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.914
Why don't we get tracksuits
and play chess at the park?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.316
I already got a chess crew.

06:24.318 --> 06:27.319
♪ ♪

06:27.321 --> 06:29.688
You do that right outside
of the loft?

06:29.690 --> 06:31.923
Yeah, right outside the loft.
How have I never seen you once?

06:31.925 --> 06:32.858
'Cause you don't go outside
of the loft.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.359
That's just not true.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.360
Fellas,

06:35.362 --> 06:37.596
fellas, fellas, I got it.
Yeah?

06:37.598 --> 06:38.663
Metal detectors?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.933
That's a super cool idea, man.

06:41.935 --> 06:42.901
I appreciate the idea.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.236
I want to hear more about it.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.972
I feel like I'm being teased.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.511
Let me guess,
you guys are pre-gaming

06:52.513 --> 06:54.913
before your high school reunion.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.282
You were nerds, but you grew
up to be super handsome.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.617
You were cool
but approachable.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.051
Maybe you were rollerbladers...

07:00.053 --> 07:01.520
Okay. Here's the deal.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.754
You're all models now,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.122
and that's your new manager.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.024
H-Hold on a sec. There's
only one number on this card,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.959
and there's two of you.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.294
Oh.
(laughs)

07:09.296 --> 07:10.929
You think we're trying
to pick you up,

07:10.931 --> 07:12.764
because we're at a bar
and we're telling you

07:12.766 --> 07:13.932
how handsome you are.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.201
Excuse me.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.636
You're hot,
and you're about to make

07:17.638 --> 07:19.037
the easiest decision
of your life.

Only child, right?

07:28.115 --> 07:31.283
I guess now I am.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.151
As of yesterday.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.289
Sorry, did you...?
Did you...?

07:37.291 --> 07:38.423
It's loud.
Did you hear what I,

07:38.425 --> 07:39.991
I said?
I said you were hot.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.093
Um, have you ever thought
about modeling?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.929
Lady, you can't treat me
like a piece of meat.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.631
Now, I know I'm hot, but
I don't need your validation.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.767
We're trying to have
a serious conversation here

07:48.769 --> 07:50.101

08:07.588 --> 08:08.987
So, how'd you do?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.956
Got a couple irons
in the fire, so...

08:10.958 --> 08:12.924
Me, too, me, too.
Planted a couple seeds,

08:12.926 --> 08:14.926
just waiting
for the harvest.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.595
Hey! Hey, you.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.596
Stop what you're
doing right now.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.797
What? I'm sorry.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.831
That's just how I walk.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.999
If I don't swing my arms,

08:21.001 --> 08:22.100
I start thinking I'm standing,

08:22.102 --> 08:23.168
and I'll fall.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.436
Oh...
(chuckles)

08:24.438 --> 08:26.638
Tell me, do you have any
modeling experience?

08:26.640 --> 08:27.939
I was trapped
in a window display

08:27.941 --> 08:29.107
in a department store once,

08:29.109 --> 08:30.642
and I was on the news a lot.

08:30.644 --> 08:34.279
Are we talking local
or national news?

08:34.281 --> 08:35.447
Oh, that's a good question.

08:35.449 --> 08:37.516
Um...

08:39.620 --> 08:41.653
I think-- sorry--
what my friend is trying to say

08:41.655 --> 08:44.122
is that it sounds like
you have on-camera experience,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.991
and if you would like,
we can hook you up

08:45.993 --> 08:48.460
with a top talent manager who
could get you an audition today.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.996
I do like hooking my
thumb into my belt loops,

08:50.998 --> 08:51.897
and pulling my pants down...

08:51.899 --> 08:53.498
Yeah. No.
Don't do it now.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.300
But it is
called "the cowboy."

08:55.302 --> 08:56.902
And I can see it's
not your first rodeo.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.571
Okay. Uh, your new
manager's name is Cece.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.939
Go to that address.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.076
Thanks. Okay.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.914
No, don't say it.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.181
We're a team.
No.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.149
I'm the bait,
you're the hook.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.517
I don't think
the bait usually

09:12.519 --> 09:14.586
thinks of the hook
as its teammate.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.087
That's such a hook thing to say.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.522
You're such a hook.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.924
You know...

09:18.926 --> 09:23.094
I've always wanted
to have a boys spa day.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.998
Nick, did you wear your
shirt during the massage?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.433
I did, but no bottoms.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.434
It was liberating.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.435
Good for you.
Check this out.

09:30.437 --> 09:33.238
These cucumbers are gratis.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.940
(laughs)
I'm gonna make some pickles.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.741
If you're impressed by a couple
of free cucumbers,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.276
get ready to have your
blind blown,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.512
'cause I signed us up
for the elite package.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.447
Does that mean the pickle's
already pickled?

09:42.449 --> 09:44.683
Gentlemen, eucalyptus towels?
Thank you.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.918
Oh, yeah--
Uh, mine's already wet!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.687
No, no, no, it's for smelling,
not drying.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.754
Oh.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.923
Put it up to your face,
smell it.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.792
Mmm. How could a smell
be both hot and cold

09:53.794 --> 09:55.961
at the same time, I ask.
It's nice.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.028
Ooh, this place is dope.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.197
Man, I feel very Roman.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.032
Boys, I think
we found our ritual.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.200
(laughing)
Yeah, we did.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.602
If you gentlemen are ready,
I can take you

10:03.604 --> 10:04.703
to your Brazilians.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.205
(laughs)
Sounds very fun.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.306
I'm in a relationship,

10:08.308 --> 10:09.774
myself.
Yeah.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.976
Uh, but I would
love to look.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.611
Just point me to
the door, please.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.779
Sir. The elite package at S'Pa

10:14.781 --> 10:17.549
includes the wax removal of hair
from your nether regions.

10:21.922 --> 10:22.921
What did you say, homeboy?

10:22.923 --> 10:24.222
Scrotum wax.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.595
No, Schmidt.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.198
Say something.
Say something to him.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.601
CECE:
Donovan.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.003
I have some
very good news.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.505
I have a brand-new client

10:40.507 --> 10:42.607
that I am very excited
for you to meet.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.676
I'm Dean and I'm a model.
Mm-hmm.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.679
But I'm a model.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.114
No. I'm a model.
Yeah, both models.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.148
No. I'm a model.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.149
No. I-I am a model.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.451
I am... I'm the model.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.619
But, like, I'm, but I model.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.787
I'm a model.
I model.
You...

10:55.789 --> 10:57.155
I'm a model.
I just told-- I'm a model.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.790
Astro Fuel.
I model.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.659
What the heck is going on?

11:00.661 --> 11:04.095
Well, Cece's Boys is growing,
so I'm just gonna help Dean

11:04.097 --> 11:06.765
make a résumé for the big
audition we're all gonna go on.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.832
What about my résumé?

11:07.834 --> 11:08.800
You already have a résumé.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.269
Well, I-I-I want another one.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.971
And another sandwich.
I want a sandwich, too.

11:12.973 --> 11:13.938
Stop copying me!

11:13.940 --> 11:15.974
Donovan. Dean.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.446
REAGAN:
Um...

11:21.448 --> 11:22.681
Hmm.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.783
(indistinct chatter)

11:24.785 --> 11:25.984
No...

11:25.986 --> 11:27.052
The line between
what we're doing

11:27.054 --> 11:29.154
and being creepy is so thin.
(cell phone rings)

11:29.156 --> 11:30.822
Hey, Cece, what's up?

11:30.824 --> 11:31.956
Any luck? The audition's
in an hour,

11:31.958 --> 11:33.191
I'm getting kind of panicky.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.959
Yeah. Totally. Um...

11:34.961 --> 11:36.861
We're just looking for that
perfect Cece's Boys type,

11:36.863 --> 11:38.963
you know... perfect.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.965
Ow!
I don't know hair this short
can get so tangled!

11:40.967 --> 11:42.467
Okay?
You're hurting me.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.635
I'm very sorry.
DONOVAN: Cece, I don't know

11:43.637 --> 11:45.070
how many buttons
to do on my shirt.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.071
Donovan, please.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.573
Look, Jess.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.008
If you haven't found
anyone by now,

11:50.010 --> 11:52.177
maybe I should just
cut my losses.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.079
Maybe I should just
tell them I only--

11:54.081 --> 11:56.081
No, no, no, no, no.
We actually, um...

11:56.083 --> 11:57.682
(clears throat)
We have two guys, we'll...

11:57.684 --> 12:00.151
You do? Oh!
...bring them right over.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.120
You are the best.
Thank you!

12:02.923 --> 12:04.055
I'm sorry?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.691
I'm gonna be honest.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.326
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.329
Oh, it-it's the other one.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.098
No.
They have a real look.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.099
What look would that be?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.600
I own my own
dog-walking company?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.001
Branding!

12:17.003 --> 12:18.002
You're good.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.771
You know what?
I believe in them.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.607
And we also
have no other choice.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.275
So let's get them camera-ready.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.844
How far away is
that camera gonna be?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.312
(laughs)

12:33.754 --> 12:35.920
Okay, guys, let's go--
Oh, hey, Kirby.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.589
Looking good.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.190
That is for cats.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.259
But it's okay.
Put this on.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.761
They're from my roommate's
earthquake kit.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.129
He has a three-week supply.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.930
Bruce. Put this on.
They won't recognize you

12:45.932 --> 12:48.099
on your next volunteer
shift at the hospital.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.935
Ah. Jess. Hallway.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.438
Okay, are you absolutely sure

12:53.440 --> 12:55.707
that this is the way to go?

12:55.709 --> 12:58.943
Can't we get our hands on,
like, a water polo team?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.613
Or hire escorts?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.782
Or call in a bomb
threat to the audition.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.083
In this political environment?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.785
Oh, I'm nervous even saying it.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.253
What about nothing?
No!

13:08.255 --> 13:11.589
Is nothing maybe the right
thing to do in this situation?

13:11.591 --> 13:13.758
We can't bail on Cece.
This is her shot.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.493
We can't let her
become irrelevant

13:15.495 --> 13:17.962
like chunky belts,
or quoting<i> Borat.</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:19.430
Okay. Well, if I have
to go down with the ship,

13:19.432 --> 13:20.965
I'm not going down
without a fight.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.101
And those two are
gonna need a lot more

13:23.103 --> 13:24.435
than hair gel and V-necks.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.437
They're gonna need
motorcycle boots,

13:26.439 --> 13:28.940
scarves, knit caps,

13:28.942 --> 13:31.643
and all the eye makeup
that Schmidt's got.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.444
DEAN (muffled):
Cece?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.180
Hello?

13:36.449 --> 13:37.849
Cece?

13:37.851 --> 13:40.585
(muttering)
What are you doing in here?

13:40.587 --> 13:41.953
Donovan told me to wait here
in your break room

13:41.955 --> 13:43.621
and then he left.
What?!

13:43.623 --> 13:45.523
And I couldn't open the door
and it was really dark.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.625
Donovan, get in here right now!

13:47.627 --> 13:50.094
Donovan, we have
an audition

13:50.096 --> 13:53.097
in an hour and you
lock Dean in a closet?

13:53.099 --> 13:54.332
Well, you said
I was your number one client.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.800
Okay. No. Wait, Donovan.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.603
I'm out of here.
Just calm down. Wait.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.105
I went the wrong way.
Don't look.

14:01.107 --> 14:03.107
(whispering):
So, what are we thinking?

14:03.109 --> 14:04.509
I don't know. Maybe they give
you something to bite down on.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.010
No, I'm talking about leaving!

14:06.012 --> 14:07.278
You're being
so dramatic right now.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.613
I don't think
I'm being dramatic.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.481
Look, I'll say it now
without any drama.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.518
I don't want the hairs ripped
off my testicles by a stranger.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.119
I think they're there
for a reason.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.521
They are trained professionals
in there.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.624
This isn't gonna be some
back-alley sack waxing.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.125
They have those?

14:21.127 --> 14:23.294
I'm sure they do,
but this isn't one of them.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.462
Who would go to that one?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.130
(sputters) Well, sometimes,
in an emergency,

14:26.132 --> 14:28.633
you got to do
what you got to do.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.068
What would
the emergency ever be?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.903
Nick, this is gonna be like
cottage cheese all over again.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.905
At first, you're gonna be
kicking and screaming,

14:33.907 --> 14:35.073
saying that you
don't want to try it,

14:35.075 --> 14:36.808
but I'm telling
you, in the end,

14:36.810 --> 14:38.910
you're gonna tell everybody that
you meet how much you loved it.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.345
This is nothing
like cottage cheese.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.013
Exactly like cottage cheese.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.815
Guys, I have off-the-charts
follicle strength, okay?

14:43.817 --> 14:46.084
It'll be a blood bath down
there, a real crime scene,

14:46.086 --> 14:47.585
so I'm leaning, "No."

14:47.587 --> 14:49.254
I'm out!
Like my mother says

14:49.256 --> 14:50.655
at every party she goes to,

14:50.657 --> 14:52.924
"No one touches my purse."

14:52.926 --> 14:54.759
Good day.
Wait. Sit.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.261
Wait. Sit down.
You guys don't

14:56.263 --> 14:58.196
need to leave.
Just a minute ago,

14:58.198 --> 15:00.031
you were saying how much
you love this place.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.034
Just don't get your sack waxed.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.003
Okay, I don't care
how big the park is.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.005
If there is a loose bear in it,

15:07.007 --> 15:08.606
I'm not going in the park!

15:08.608 --> 15:09.941
I'm never going
in that park again!

15:09.943 --> 15:11.576
I'm never going in again!

15:11.578 --> 15:12.610
But this is our ritual!

15:12.612 --> 15:13.578
Schmidt,
we'll just find a new one.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.746
Easy for you to say.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.914
You two guys
are still gonna be

15:15.916 --> 15:17.415
living together in the loft,

15:17.417 --> 15:19.083
saying, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.085
I didn't know you were
in here in the bathroom."

15:21.087 --> 15:23.855
And coming up with clever
names for the Wi-Fi network

15:23.857 --> 15:26.591
like, "This Is 4D."
That's pretty good.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.693
I'd say we just... Let's agree
right now to switch it to that.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.461
Points is, is your lives
are going to go on,

15:30.463 --> 15:33.831
and I'll just always be
that weirdo you once lived with.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.269
So you know what?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.538
I am gonna get

15:40.540 --> 15:42.307
my sack waxed.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.709
So enjoy the rest
of your lives together.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.544
I'm gonna go shuck this corn.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.714
Oh, man.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.716
Hey, do you think
they'll take a picture of him

15:51.718 --> 15:53.785
just as they rip
like they do on roller coasters?

15:53.787 --> 15:56.421
I think you missed the point
of what just happened.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.489
(laughing)

16:04.764 --> 16:05.964
Did you just see that?

16:05.966 --> 16:06.931
No. I had my eyes closed.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.433
I was saying a
non-denominational prayer

16:08.435 --> 16:09.934
for Bruce and Kirby.
What did I miss?

16:09.936 --> 16:11.936
That woman just
checked out our guys.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.605
Like, she-she really
checked them out.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.275
Maybe we have a chance.
I don't know.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.110
Did you hear what
you just said?

16:19.112 --> 16:21.112
What?
You said, "Our guys."

16:21.114 --> 16:22.447
Okay, let's just go in.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.681
Our guys!

16:23.683 --> 16:24.849
Don't get sentimental.

16:24.851 --> 16:25.683
Our guys.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.951
Oh, you get off of me.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.519
Our guys!

16:30.357 --> 16:33.191
(indistinct chatter)

16:46.139 --> 16:47.772
Jess, I asked for models,
not a couple

16:47.774 --> 16:48.940
of driver's ed instructors!

16:48.942 --> 16:51.109
I know, Cece, but they're
hot on the inside.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.978
Bruce teaches CPR to children
with irregular mouths,

16:53.980 --> 16:57.015
and Kirby has given so much bone
marrow, they told him to stop.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.983
I don't know
how that's gonna help them

16:58.985 --> 17:00.451
at a print ad audition.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.120
You're right, she's right.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.122
I don't know what
we were thinking.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.623
Let's go put these dogs down.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.625
Why did we even give them names?

17:07.627 --> 17:08.459
They came with names.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.794
Right, I guess
what I meant

17:09.796 --> 17:11.596
is why did we bothering
learning them.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.966
Guys,

17:14.968 --> 17:15.967
uh, there's

17:15.969 --> 17:17.869
been a little hiccup.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.170
We're allowed
to eat all these, right?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.238
I just love them.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.908
Yeah, you guys
can keep eating. Um,

17:23.910 --> 17:27.478
so, there's no way to sugarcoat
this, but the truth is...

17:27.480 --> 17:29.914
(shushing)
Wait, wait, wait...

17:29.916 --> 17:32.016
Ooh, nasty!
So gross, right?

17:32.018 --> 17:33.017
(shushing)
Cece?

17:33.019 --> 17:35.653
Cece, come here.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.855
What?
Look around this room.

17:37.857 --> 17:41.159
Nobody's eating these things
but them.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.261
Oh, my God, yes!

17:43.263 --> 17:44.929
And they love them.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.497
It almost makes me
want to try them.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.033
And I emphasize "almost."

17:49.035 --> 17:52.170
They're making a mistake.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.507
These are the guys
that can sell this stuff.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.709
Not these guys.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.012
But they've already decided
on the direction of the ad.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.413
So tell them to change it!

18:02.415 --> 18:04.982
I mean, what have you
got to lose?

18:11.357 --> 18:13.925
Hey, Joy.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.960
I'm scared.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.028
NICK:
Don't you be scared, kid!

18:17.030 --> 18:18.029
Nick?

18:18.031 --> 18:19.430
We're here with you, buddy!

18:19.432 --> 18:20.698
Winston!

18:20.700 --> 18:22.033
NICK:
We don't need a ritual, Schmidt,

18:22.035 --> 18:24.035
'cause you're not gonna lose us.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.270
I thought we could've
just told you that,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.439
but Winston thought
we needed to show it.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.807
Yeah, I thought
that would be better.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.943
You know,
it makes more sense to me.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.978
Band of brothers.
Band of brothers!

18:33.980 --> 18:36.047
That's right, man.
Band of brothers, bro.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.181
Band of brothers.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.785
You know,
I've been a little bit

18:40.787 --> 18:41.986
curious about it
this whole time.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.155
I just couldn't admit it to you
guys, you know?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.323
I think this would be
more dignified

18:45.325 --> 18:46.757
if we did it in silence.
SCHMIDT: Of course.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.758
Yeah, let's do this in silence.
Good luck, guys.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.793
I'm ready for you, lady.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.794
Three friends going

18:49.796 --> 18:51.496
on the same silent journey,

18:51.498 --> 18:53.297
together, yet separate,

18:53.299 --> 18:55.766
alone, yet closer than ever.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.001
(screaming)

18:57.003 --> 18:58.769
Nick?
I'm all right!

18:58.771 --> 19:00.104
(paper ripping,
Winston screaming)

19:00.106 --> 19:02.173
SCHMIDT:
Winston?
Can you hear me, Schmidt?!

19:02.175 --> 19:03.774
You hang in there,
you son of a... (screaming)

19:03.776 --> 19:05.676
Aah! This woman's
ripping it off!

19:05.678 --> 19:08.379
(shrieking)

19:11.017 --> 19:13.017
Ooh! That's actually
kind of warm. Ouch!

19:13.019 --> 19:14.919
No! Okay, time out, time out,
time out, time out,

19:14.921 --> 19:16.454
time out, time out,
time out, time out, time out!

19:16.456 --> 19:17.989
(paper rips)

19:17.991 --> 19:19.457
(slowed-down,
distorted speech)

19:19.459 --> 19:21.826
(screaming)

19:21.828 --> 19:24.028
(slowed-down yelling)

19:26.099 --> 19:27.665
(slow-motion, distorted):
No, no, no! No!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.800
(yelling, ripping sound)

19:29.802 --> 19:32.103
(yelling)

19:32.105 --> 19:33.671
(ripping sound)

19:33.673 --> 19:35.239
(distorted yelling)

19:36.309 --> 19:38.109
(distorted groaning)

19:38.111 --> 19:40.178
(distorted yelling)

19:40.180 --> 19:41.612
(distorted):
Oh!

19:41.614 --> 19:43.714
(yelling and howling)

19:46.119 --> 19:49.587
How many times
do you freakin' do it?!

19:51.124 --> 19:53.191
Okay, good. You
both are here.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.993
So, guess who got the
Sausage Crunchies job.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.296
(gasps)
Oh, yay, Kirby!
Hey, Kirby!

19:58.298 --> 20:00.131
Not Kirby, but I am going
to hang on to him.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.133
I think he could book
ads for both fast food

20:02.135 --> 20:03.534
and anti-depressants.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.203
Ah.
Bruce?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.003
They absolutely hated Bruce.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.139
He got sick during the audition.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.641
Sausage Crunchies everywhere.
That's a lot.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.411
But they loved Dean!

20:13.413 --> 20:15.012
Mm. (laughs)
Oh, it's nice to see

20:15.014 --> 20:16.747
the good guys win.
Right?!

20:16.749 --> 20:19.750
They said I brought them the
best and the worst of the day,

20:19.752 --> 20:22.420
so... maybe that's my thing.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.088
Hmm.
Can I throw out this,

20:24.090 --> 20:26.090
uh, soggy bag of cucumbers?

20:26.092 --> 20:27.024
WINSTON:
No!

20:27.026 --> 20:28.492
Those are pickles in progress.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.761
(groaning)

20:30.763 --> 20:32.029
Um, I don't mean to be mean,
but you guys are being real

20:32.031 --> 20:33.698
babies about this whole thing.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.765
(laughs)
They don't...

20:34.767 --> 20:36.534
Until you've had
your sack waxed,

20:36.536 --> 20:37.835
you can't know this pain.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.103
Excuse me?
Childbirth?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.038
Weekly wax, top to tail.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.873
We went through hell,
and we came out

20:42.875 --> 20:44.108
the other side, gentlemen.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.876
It was war.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.944
Granted, one that took place

20:46.946 --> 20:50.681
in a high end-spa,
but still our war.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.116
(laughs)
That's right.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.251
I mean, this not something
we do every week, right?

20:53.253 --> 20:54.252
No, it's like a monthly thing.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.020
Monthly?
Not a chance!

20:56.022 --> 20:58.422
It's our ritual.
No. No, no, no, no.
One time only.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.458
Guys, how can it be a ritual
if we only do it one time?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.261
Shut up, Schmidt!
I will never go back!

21:06.432 --> 21:08.766
(Winston crying)

21:08.768 --> 21:10.835
NICK:<i> It's okay, man. We're</i>
