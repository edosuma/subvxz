Ah!

[phone rings]

03:09.375 --> 03:10.709
Hi, can you hear me?

03:10.709 --> 03:12.751
[from phone] Hey, Sis.
Yeah, I can hear you great.

03:12.751 --> 03:15.417
JOSH: Loud and clear.
SAMMY: Oh, hi.

03:16.042 --> 03:19.042
So, are you going
to be able to make it?

03:19.042 --> 03:20.292
Tell me you changed your mind.

03:20.292 --> 03:23.918
No. Josh, stop it.
You're killing me.

03:23.918 --> 03:27.042
Come on. Charlet
misses her pattycakes.

03:27.042 --> 03:28.083
Auntie Sammy!

03:28.083 --> 03:30.709
Aw! Oh, come on,
that's not fair.

03:30.709 --> 03:31.834
Darn right it's not fair.

03:31.834 --> 03:36.000
This is the second Christmas
in a row you're skipping out on.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.417
I know.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.250
And you're leaving me alone
with Mom... and Dad.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.626
I mean, I gotta use
all the ammunition I got.

03:41.626 --> 03:44.876
Josh, I promise I will make it
up to you next Christmas.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.834
SAMMY: I swear.
[baby fusses]

03:46.834 --> 03:49.709
I really,
really mean it this time.

03:49.709 --> 03:52.000
TABITHA: Is she coming?
SAMMY: It's just that I'm--
I'm almost done

03:52.000 --> 03:53.125
with the first draft.
JOSH: No.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.375
You know how I get
when I'm writing.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.209
I get hyper-focused and--

03:56.209 --> 03:57.000
[baby gibberish]

03:57.000 --> 03:58.542
...and it's not fair
to you guys.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.042
Oh. Sorry Sammy.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.959
I was just, uh,
a little distracted.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.918
What can I say?
I miss you, Sis.

04:05.918 --> 04:08.209
I miss you, too.
And uh...

04:08.209 --> 04:10.375
but this really is
what's best for me right now.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.083
I hope you understand that.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.000
[sighs] Yeah, I hear ya.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.791
It's just... Look, I understand
your work's important,

04:17.791 --> 04:18.625
but sometimes you gotta...

04:18.625 --> 04:21.250
I can start sorting out
the cabin while I'm up here.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.501
Sammy, there's no rush
on that.

04:23.501 --> 04:24.667
We can easily do that
next summer.

04:24.667 --> 04:28.709
I have to go back out to finish
construction on the porch.

04:28.709 --> 04:29.292
I know, but...

04:29.292 --> 04:31.876
it'll get done faster
and I'm already here.

04:31.876 --> 04:35.375
Listen, Christmas
is a time for family.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.542
You need to be around
the ones you love

04:37.542 --> 04:40.042
and the ones that love you.

04:40.042 --> 04:42.751
I hear you,
and I understand.

04:42.751 --> 04:44.876
Did you get
your package from Nana?

04:44.876 --> 04:46.709
Yes, I did.
It's in my bag.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.250
I can't wait to open it.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.542
We couldn't wait.
It's epic.

04:50.542 --> 04:55.083
Ours was a phosphorescent
Thomas Kincaid wall hanging.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.459
We've already put it up.

04:56.459 --> 04:57.042
[Sammy laughs]

04:57.042 --> 04:59.751
Okay. Well, look, I'm, uh,
I'm up by the cell tree

04:59.751 --> 05:01.709
and I am freezing my butt off.

05:01.709 --> 05:05.959
Ummm, so I'm going
to get going, but, uh,

05:05.959 --> 05:08.375
call you on Christmas Eve, okay?

05:08.375 --> 05:10.876
Okay. I love you, Sis.

05:10.876 --> 05:11.459
I love you, too.

05:11.459 --> 05:13.792
Give my love and hugs
to everyone, okay?

05:13.792 --> 05:14.959
Will do.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.501
All right. Bye-bye.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.792
Merry Christmas.

05:21.542 --> 05:25.542
Well, hello there, kiddo.
What you doin' there?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.542
It needs a little kick.

05:27.542 --> 05:29.042
[chuckles] Okay.

05:29.042 --> 05:32.334
You go tell Mom
we're going to brunch.

05:32.334 --> 05:34.501
[shouting] Yay, brunch!

05:39.042 --> 05:42.501
[♪♪♪]

05:55.459 --> 05:59.751
Seth, that probate officer
Mr. Pricker called again.

05:59.751 --> 06:00.542
And if I have to hear that...

06:00.542 --> 06:02.876
Octavia, what are you
talking about here?

06:02.876 --> 06:06.334
Probate? I thought
that was all settled.

06:06.334 --> 06:06.876
You thought wrong.

06:06.876 --> 06:11.209
Now, have you found anyone for
the Mathis Christmas party yet?

06:11.209 --> 06:12.626
I RSVP'd you for two,

06:12.626 --> 06:15.042
so you need to get yourself
a girl, Seth.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.876
It's a Mele Kalikimaka thing.

06:17.876 --> 06:20.626
Don't forget to break out
your grass skirt.

06:43.709 --> 06:47.042
Yoo-hoo!

06:47.042 --> 06:48.667
[Seth sighs]

06:56.292 --> 06:58.918
Seth, do you think
it's wise to go tromping off

06:58.918 --> 07:00.334
into the middle of nowhere?

07:00.334 --> 07:01.417
Yes.

07:01.417 --> 07:02.876
In the middle of winter?

07:02.876 --> 07:03.876
Yes!

07:03.876 --> 07:04.876
At Christmas?

07:04.876 --> 07:06.209
[Seth sighs]

07:06.209 --> 07:08.042
Bah, humbug.

07:08.042 --> 07:10.876
What about
the Mathis contract?

07:10.876 --> 07:13.292
This should
only take a few days.

07:13.292 --> 07:15.167
I'll be back
with plenty enough time

07:15.167 --> 07:17.334
to finalize
the Mathis contract.

07:17.334 --> 07:17.751
When?

07:17.751 --> 07:20.501
At the Christmas party
before they leave on holiday.

07:20.501 --> 07:24.334
And then, I can focus
on closing that Somas deal.

07:24.334 --> 07:26.000
You're always running
after tomorrow, Seth.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.709
You know there's more to life
than business.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.000
You can't chase progress,
Octavia.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.709
You have to beat progress.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.709
But is all this work
really worth it...

07:34.709 --> 07:36.167
at this time of the year?

07:36.167 --> 07:39.709
You have your way of
celebrating and I have mine.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.417
Look, I'll be back in two days.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.626
Today's a gift, Seth.

07:43.626 --> 07:45.918
That's why they call it
the present.

07:45.918 --> 07:48.334
It would do you good
to remember that.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.501
[raps files on desk]

07:51.542 --> 07:53.459
Merry Christmas.

CHEFS COUNTRY CAFE

08:19.125 --> 08:19.709
Yes, yes, hello.

08:19.709 --> 08:24.459
I'm trying to reach
a Mrs. Craigland.

08:24.459 --> 08:29.375
It's regarding the property
off of Old Forks Road.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.417
And I do apologize
for the late...

08:31.417 --> 08:33.667
Can I get you
anything else, hon?

08:33.667 --> 08:36.751
No, I'm-- I'm good.
Thank you.

08:36.751 --> 08:38.792
I believe that there were
some documents

08:38.792 --> 08:40.626
left out of the package
I received

08:40.626 --> 08:43.626
from the country surveyor's
office.

08:43.626 --> 08:47.375
[sighs] Well, for one thing,
there was no address listed.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.209
How am I supposed to
even find this place?

08:51.626 --> 08:58.375
Oh, okay, but lot numbers don't
show up on Google Map searches.

08:58.375 --> 09:07.375
But I-- please, just...
Hello? Hello?

09:07.375 --> 09:10.292
Oh, of course.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.042
[Seth sighs]

09:14.918 --> 09:17.501
Looks like you got
your hands full.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.584
Markets never sleep.

09:22.584 --> 09:26.125
Well, city boy,
what brings you to these parts?

09:26.125 --> 09:28.042
Business, actually.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.000
Apparently,
I had a Great-Uncle Larry

09:30.000 --> 09:32.167
who left me property
around here.

09:32.167 --> 09:35.125
Well, that doesn't sound
like business to me.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.250
I'm gonna sell it.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.000
I just came out here
for the weekend

09:38.000 --> 09:39.375
to survey the property,

09:39.375 --> 09:43.334
and the logging rights alone
are probably worth a fortune.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.876
Problem is, I don't know
how to find this place.

09:46.876 --> 09:50.125
I have survey lines and
a reference to Old Forks Road,

09:50.125 --> 09:53.584
but Old Forks Road
doesn't show up on any map.

09:53.584 --> 09:56.375
Old Forks Road
is a gaming trail.

09:57.459 --> 09:58.709
Do you know how to get there?

09:58.709 --> 10:03.083
Of course, I do. I got my first
buck out by Walker Ridge.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.083
Walker Ridge.
Walker. Yeah, yeah.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.125
Larry Walker
was my Great-Uncle.

10:07.125 --> 10:10.334
You must be talkin'
about Ol' Gusty.

10:10.334 --> 10:10.834
Gusty?

10:10.834 --> 10:14.083
He was always blowin'
in and outta town, you know.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.083
People never knew whether
he was comin' or goin'.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.626
[chuckles]

10:18.626 --> 10:21.876
That's how
he got the name Gusty.

10:21.876 --> 10:23.918
You don't say.

10:23.918 --> 10:27.501
He always was off
lookin' for his fortune.

10:27.501 --> 10:33.042
Nobody's seen him since he
broke off with that Parker gal.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.542
Did you say Parker?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.918
Yes. Mary Beth Parker.

10:36.918 --> 10:41.959
He even, uh, built her
a cabin up at Parker Pass.

10:41.959 --> 10:44.292
After the engagement
was broken off...

10:44.292 --> 10:48.083
well, Gusty left town.
[chuckles]

10:48.083 --> 10:52.250
Mary Beth,
she married a Whetly.

10:53.709 --> 10:54.459
Mary Beth Parker.

10:54.459 --> 10:57.209
She's the other shareholder
on the property.

10:57.209 --> 10:59.250
Oh.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.542
I wanna buy her out.

11:00.542 --> 11:03.792
With what-- towards, you know,
probate and all that.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.375
I see.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.250
Right.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.584
Can you tell me
how to get there?

11:08.584 --> 11:10.501
Of course, I can.

11:19.542 --> 11:20.751
Got somethin' to write on?

11:20.751 --> 11:24.667
I don't have anything.

MR. GATLY: Thank you.
RUBY: What are you boys up to?

11:39.542 --> 11:40.209
A fortune.

11:40.209 --> 11:43.375
[laughs]
Good luck with that!

11:43.375 --> 11:45.792
[chuckles] Yeah.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.626
We're gonna
split the fortune, right?

11:48.626 --> 11:50.959
SETH: Slow down.
MR. GALTY: This is like
a secret map.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.542
We're gonna split the fortune
or are we not?

11:53.542 --> 11:54.792

of course you don't.

Look, I almost died
like five times today.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.876
Look, I'm lost and alone
and I just...

17:04.876 --> 17:10.791
I just need you to...
I need you to please...

17:10.791 --> 17:13.416
Thank you.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.125
[collapses on floor]

17:15.125 --> 17:21.459
[Sammy gasps]

17:21.459 --> 17:22.959
[Seth grunts]

17:29.292 --> 17:31.959
[Sammy sighs]

17:44.542 --> 17:47.542
[Seth groans and grunts]

18:04.042 --> 18:05.584
Hello?

18:22.250 --> 18:24.292
[loud thumping]

18:26.167 --> 18:27.667
'Morning.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.167
Ah, good morning.

18:30.167 --> 18:32.209
Getting in a little,
uh, mountain workout?

18:32.209 --> 18:36.292
[chuckles] There was a ring
around the moon last night.

18:36.292 --> 18:37.751
It's gonna snow.

18:37.751 --> 18:40.292
I think I saw that.

18:40.292 --> 18:41.876
[Seth groans]

18:43.542 --> 18:45.042
You all right?

18:45.042 --> 18:46.626
Oh, I'm good.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.334
Look like you're hurtin'.

18:48.334 --> 18:50.125
Nah, I'm good.

18:51.125 --> 18:51.709
Sure about that?

18:51.709 --> 18:55.083
[groans] Nah,
it's just a little tweak.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.918
Okay.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.834
Let's get you inside.

18:58.834 --> 19:00.167
Come on.

19:00.167 --> 19:04.834
Okay. [sighs]

19:04.834 --> 19:06.125
[Seth groans]

19:06.125 --> 19:09.709
Okay, come on now.
Are you bleeding?

19:09.709 --> 19:10.834
Maybe just internally.

19:10.834 --> 19:13.959
[chuckles] Okay then,
you'll be fine.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.959
Here, lie down on the floor.

19:17.501 --> 19:18.626
Easy.

19:18.626 --> 19:19.083
Easy does it.

19:19.083 --> 19:23.501
[Seth grunts]
SAMMY: Put your feet up here,
on the table.

19:23.501 --> 19:25.125
[Seth grunts]

19:25.125 --> 19:26.709
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

19:26.709 --> 19:28.542
[groans]
What is this gonna do?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.250
Trust me, it works.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.626
[sighs] Your bedside manner
is a little rusty.

19:33.626 --> 19:39.542
Well, this couch here
has a long list of victims.

19:39.542 --> 19:43.542
[groans and grunts]
I think it's gettin' worse.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.792
Give it a minute
and you might just live.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.751
[sighs] You're out here
in the wilderness,

19:48.751 --> 19:51.501
Seth Walker
from San Francisco.

19:51.501 --> 19:53.167
Survival of the fittest.

19:53.167 --> 19:57.375
Yeah, it seems like
I'm learnin' that by the minute.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.751
Wait, how did you... ?

19:58.751 --> 20:00.792
I rifled through your wallet.

20:03.042 --> 20:03.501
What?

20:03.501 --> 20:06.709
Actually, it was a very
sensible thing for me to do.

20:06.709 --> 20:11.250
What if you were crazy?
What if you were a criminal?

20:11.250 --> 20:12.709
Do I look like
a criminal to you?

20:12.709 --> 20:15.751
I don't know.
Do I look crazy to you?

20:17.209 --> 20:18.667
[sighs] Of course not.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.667
Have you ever
read the book Misery?

20:20.667 --> 20:24.125
[kettle whistles]

20:26.459 --> 20:29.667
[chuckles] Relax.
I'm just messing with you.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.000
How's the back feeling?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.626
[Seth groans]

20:34.542 --> 20:38.209
Surprisingly better.

20:38.209 --> 20:39.626
Hmmpf.

20:43.083 --> 20:46.542
Samantha Whetly,
but everyone calls me Sammy.

20:46.542 --> 20:47.584
Seth Walker.

20:47.584 --> 20:48.375
Pleased to meet you

20:48.375 --> 20:50.584
and thank you for...
[chuckles]

20:50.584 --> 20:52.709
...well, everything.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.751
All right.
Let's get you up.

20:55.501 --> 20:57.042
Careful.

20:57.042 --> 20:58.167
[Seth groans]

20:58.167 --> 20:59.334
Okay.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.334
Oh, yeah.

21:00.334 --> 21:02.167
Careful. [laughs]

21:02.167 --> 21:04.042
[Seth grunts]

21:10.083 --> 21:11.209
It's hot.

21:11.209 --> 21:12.959
[Seth sighs]

21:12.959 --> 21:14.459
[Sammy chuckles]

21:16.876 --> 21:21.125
So, what brings you all the way
up here anyway, Seth Walker?

21:21.125 --> 21:25.834
Funny you should ask. Business,
actually.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.292
Business?

21:27.292 --> 21:30.292
You mentioned that your
name is Whetly.

21:30.292 --> 21:30.584
Yes.

21:30.584 --> 21:34.751
By any chance, are you related
to a Mary Beth Parker?

21:34.751 --> 21:37.334
Yes, she's
my great-grandmother.

21:37.334 --> 21:38.292
She built this cabin.

21:38.292 --> 21:41.626
Oh, actually, that's her
in that picture there.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.876
How do you know
about Mary Beth?

21:43.876 --> 21:49.417
Well, actually, my Great-Uncle
Larry built this cabin in 1928.

21:49.417 --> 21:51.709
But apparently
your great-grandmother

21:51.709 --> 21:55.918
and my great-uncle
had a thing.

21:55.918 --> 21:58.792
Never trust a Walker.

21:58.792 --> 21:59.667
Huh?

21:59.667 --> 22:01.626
They'll always walk away.

22:02.834 --> 22:07.459
Look, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.709
I-- I would love to, and...

22:08.709 --> 22:13.792
I could do that as soon as
we can settle on a price.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.751
Price?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.334
For what?

22:18.000 --> 22:22.125
It turns out that my Uncle
Larry's estate was left...

22:22.125 --> 22:25.209
well, let's just say
kind of messy.

22:25.209 --> 22:29.042
But what does your mess
have to do with my cabin?

22:29.042 --> 22:32.792
You are a living relative
of Mary Beth Parker.

22:32.792 --> 22:36.209
You have no idea
how happy that makes me.

22:36.209 --> 22:37.709
Why?

22:37.709 --> 22:42.167
I wanna buy out your family's
share in the cabin.

22:42.167 --> 22:43.709
[chuckles] You're mistaken.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.667
This is my great-grandmother's
cabin.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.459
My family owns it.

22:48.709 --> 22:51.083
That's not exactly accurate.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.542
[Seth grunts]

22:57.876 --> 23:00.334
Well, see for yourself.

23:01.334 --> 23:04.042
That is a copy
of my great-uncle's will.

23:04.042 --> 23:08.334
In it you'll find a reference
to a Mary Beth Parker.

23:08.334 --> 23:11.709
You see, my uncle
actually owns this land.

23:11.709 --> 23:13.459
A thousand acres to be exact,

23:13.459 --> 23:17.209
and he is the co-owner
of this cabin.

23:17.209 --> 23:20.250
Noted in paragraph 4 on page 2,

23:20.250 --> 23:23.375
he lists Mary Beth Parker
as the co-owner.

23:23.375 --> 23:26.709
They had a life share
in the cabin.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.751
It's all in the property title.

23:28.751 --> 23:31.959
There's a copy behind the will.

23:31.959 --> 23:33.375
A life share?

23:33.375 --> 23:35.459
Yeah, that's just
a contractual agreement

23:35.459 --> 23:38.459
between co-owners that prevents
them from selling to a--

23:38.459 --> 23:39.709
a third party
while they're still alive.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.834
[chuckles] There must be
some kind of mistake.

23:42.834 --> 23:44.167
No, no. There's no mistake.

23:44.167 --> 23:46.709
It's all right there
in black and white.

23:46.709 --> 23:49.167
I came up here
to survey the property

23:49.167 --> 23:52.375
so I could offer
a fair price.

23:52.375 --> 23:53.751
What?

23:54.209 --> 23:58.125
Samantha Whetly,
this is your lucky day.

24:00.250 --> 24:01.918
[Seth gasps]

24:02.209 --> 24:05.417
I was mistaken.
You are crazy.

24:06.501 --> 24:08.501
I can make you a good offer.

24:08.501 --> 24:09.751
Huh!

24:10.167 --> 24:12.167
You are being unreasonable.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.876
SETH: Ugh!
SAMMY: I'm being unreasonable?

24:14.876 --> 24:16.501
I'd say so.

24:16.501 --> 24:17.334
Who do you think you are?

24:17.334 --> 24:19.751
You can't just waltz in here
out in the middle of nowhere,

24:19.751 --> 24:23.876
flash that adorable grin
and expect me to sell my cabin!

24:23.876 --> 24:27.209
Okay, when you put it
that way, it looks bad.

24:27.209 --> 24:28.918
But, you can't stop progress.

24:28.918 --> 24:31.667
There is no way in hell
I would ever sell this place!

24:31.667 --> 24:35.334
Oh, come on, I'm sure
we can work something out.

24:37.125 --> 24:38.876
[groans] Okay. Fine.

24:38.876 --> 24:39.709
If you won't sign off,

24:39.709 --> 24:41.417
I guess
I'll see you in court.

24:41.417 --> 24:43.709
It's a date!

24:43.709 --> 24:44.709
[slams door]

24:44.709 --> 24:46.292

always crazy?

25:26.876 --> 25:31.209
Miss Whetly, uh, Sammy,

25:31.209 --> 25:33.042
can you let me in?

25:35.709 --> 25:39.834
Sammy, please.
I'm gonna die out here.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.250
Is that a promise?

25:42.250 --> 25:43.834
[knock on door]

25:43.834 --> 25:46.167
You know,
according to the will,

25:46.167 --> 25:48.876
I own half this cabin, too.

25:48.876 --> 25:49.709
Fifty-fifty.

25:49.709 --> 25:53.542
Now, open my door
and let me in.

25:53.542 --> 25:54.834
Ugh!

25:59.667 --> 26:03.250
[door opens]

26:03.250 --> 26:04.709
[door closes]
SAMMY: You're welcome.

26:04.709 --> 26:06.209
Don't ever say that again!

26:06.209 --> 26:07.417
Oh, thank you.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.709
Look, I know this isn't ideal,

26:08.709 --> 26:11.042
but I can't go anywhere
until that storm ends.

26:11.042 --> 26:13.209
So? Looks like you're
just going to have to

26:13.209 --> 26:15.375
make the best of it.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.834
[Sammy sighs]

26:20.292 --> 26:22.167
You can take that side.

26:22.167 --> 26:24.876
What if I have to
use the bathroom?

26:24.876 --> 26:27.709
[sighs] Fine.

26:27.709 --> 26:31.417

Fifty-fifty.

[Seth sighs]

27:14.000 --> 27:15.667

Do you think I could... ?

27:51.459 --> 27:52.751
Sure.

Mmmm, warm, buttery.

All right. Um...

Hell has finally frozen over.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.709
In 1940.

29:43.709 --> 29:45.667
This makes no sense.

You're right.
That was a horrible idea.

30:43.042 --> 30:48.334
Hey Sammy, look at this.
I think it stopped.

30:48.334 --> 30:50.834

We've been stuck
here for two days.

Really?

32:58.167 --> 33:00.125
You gave me the cold shower.

33:13.834 --> 33:14.792
What is that?

33:14.792 --> 33:17.000
It looks a little old-timey.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.709
Yahtzee.
Everyone knows Yahtzee.

33:19.709 --> 33:20.375
Yahtzee.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.542
[giggles] It's fun,
you'll like it.

33:23.542 --> 33:25.167
Do I have a choice?

33:25.167 --> 33:28.125
Nope. Come on, let's go.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.000
Hmmpf.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.584
Here is your scorecard.

33:36.751 --> 33:40.792
Oh, make sure to write
your name at the top.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.250
But it's just the two of us.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.709
I don't think
we're gonna mix 'em up.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.542
You see this box?

33:47.542 --> 33:48.834
Yeah, so?

33:48.834 --> 33:51.709
This box is filled
with scorecards

33:51.709 --> 33:53.417
going generations back.

33:53.417 --> 33:57.709
It's like a mini time capsule
of family and fun.

33:58.209 --> 34:03.250
Come on, you have no reference
point for good times gone by?

34:03.250 --> 34:04.417
Uh...

34:04.417 --> 34:05.375
well, I...

34:05.375 --> 34:07.626
That is... so sad.

34:07.626 --> 34:10.583
No, it's not sad.

34:10.583 --> 34:14.542
I just... I didn't think you
would want me to be a part of...

34:14.542 --> 34:16.375
Good times gone by?

34:17.375 --> 34:20.918
Yeah, well, you know,
it's Christmas.

34:20.918 --> 34:23.958
And you are now,
for better or worse,

34:23.958 --> 34:25.708
part of the cabin's history.

34:25.708 --> 34:30.042
So, here are the rules
of the game.

34:30.042 --> 34:33.501
[♪♪♪]

34:48.751 --> 34:52.167
[shake of dice]

34:52.167 --> 34:53.208
Yahtzee!

34:53.208 --> 34:53.876
No!

34:53.876 --> 34:54.708
Well, they're fair and square.

34:54.708 --> 34:57.751
Your beginner's luck
is killing my game!

34:57.751 --> 34:59.125
I will take it.

34:59.125 --> 35:01.000
[shakes dice]

35:12.334 --> 35:15.876
So, in regards to this
time capsule...

35:15.876 --> 35:17.209
Who all has been here?

35:17.209 --> 35:21.083
You know, mostly family.
Many long gone now, I guess.

35:21.083 --> 35:21.876
But what's the story

35:21.876 --> 35:24.751
behind your great-grandmother
Mary anyway?

35:24.751 --> 35:25.834
If I remember correctly,

35:25.834 --> 35:30.709
Great-Grandma Mary was jilted
when she was left by her fiancé

35:30.709 --> 35:34.709
who I now know to be
your great-uncle, Larry.

35:34.709 --> 35:35.667
Mary and Larry.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.209
Sounds kind of corny.

35:37.209 --> 35:40.125
It's kind of adorable
if you think about it.

35:40.501 --> 35:45.000
Anyway, story has it Larry
speculated in the stock market.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.751
Really? How random is that?

35:47.751 --> 35:50.042
Random as what?
Why's that?

35:50.042 --> 35:53.542
Oh, nothing.
Please, continue.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.542
Well, Larry, I guess,
staked his fortune

35:57.542 --> 36:00.042
in something called
utility stocks.

36:00.042 --> 36:02.083
Pffft! What?

36:02.083 --> 36:03.000
What?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.709
All right.
It's not important.

36:05.709 --> 36:08.334
Okay. So, the stock market
crashed in 1929.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.292
Black Thursday.

36:10.292 --> 36:10.792
What?

36:10.792 --> 36:13.542
Black Thursday.
October 24, 1929.

36:13.542 --> 36:16.209
That's the day
the stock market crashed.

36:16.209 --> 36:17.542
Yeah, okay. That day.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.209
Your great-uncle left
shortly thereafter

36:20.209 --> 36:21.375
to go remake his fortune,

36:21.375 --> 36:25.209
leaving my great-grandmother
with a broken heart.

36:25.209 --> 36:26.209
Ouch!

36:26.209 --> 36:29.167
And that's when
the family motto began,

36:29.167 --> 36:29.792
"Never trust a Walker.

36:29.792 --> 36:32.709
They'll always walk away,
leaving you in ruin."

36:32.709 --> 36:37.125
Wow! That is some
pretty shady drama.

36:37.125 --> 36:40.584
On behalf of all Walkers,
I would like to apologize.

36:40.584 --> 36:42.459
No, no need for that, really.

36:42.459 --> 36:44.792
I am sure the Whetlys
have plenty of skeletons

36:44.792 --> 36:45.959
in quite a few closets.

36:45.959 --> 36:50.542
So, what are you doing here
out in the middle of nowhere

36:50.542 --> 36:53.459
in the middle of winter,
Sammy Whetly?

36:53.459 --> 36:55.667
[sighs]
I am working on a project,

36:55.667 --> 36:56.542
if you can believe it.

36:56.542 --> 36:59.751
Is that what you've been
doing in your room all day?

36:59.751 --> 37:02.709
Yes, why do you ask like that?

37:02.709 --> 37:03.501
Oh, it's just...

37:03.501 --> 37:06.626
Well, I catch you
smiling a lot.

37:06.626 --> 37:08.250
[chuckles] So?

37:08.250 --> 37:10.876
So... why so smiley?

37:10.876 --> 37:12.542
What are you working on?

37:13.876 --> 37:16.209
I'm working on a book.

37:16.209 --> 37:17.167
You're a writer!

37:17.167 --> 37:19.250
Mah, something like that.

37:19.250 --> 37:20.876
And what do you write?

37:20.876 --> 37:24.209
Lately, mostly just drafts.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.959
Drafts. Sounds lucrative.

37:25.959 --> 37:28.959
Nah. Now you sound
like my brother.

37:28.959 --> 37:29.959
I'm sorry.

37:29.959 --> 37:30.834
Don't be. I get it

37:30.834 --> 37:34.501
which is why I tend to
avoid the conversation lately.

37:38.209 --> 37:39.459
[shakes dice]

37:39.459 --> 37:42.375
Come on!

37:42.375 --> 37:44.959
Oooh, 3's or 4's?

37:45.375 --> 37:48.209
Hmmm, I would go for 4's.

37:48.209 --> 37:49.626
I think I will.

37:49.626 --> 37:54.584
My, that's what,
like, eight points?

37:54.584 --> 37:56.209
Cocky.

37:56.209 --> 37:58.209
See, you are having fun.

37:58.209 --> 37:59.292
Yeah, I guess.

37:59.292 --> 38:00.375
You guess?

38:00.375 --> 38:05.042
No, I am, and it beats
a cold shower.

38:05.042 --> 38:06.792
[Sammy laughs]

38:07.125 --> 38:12.417
So you come out here to be
alone to avoid conversations?

38:12.417 --> 38:14.375
I didn't say that.

38:15.209 --> 38:18.751
Well, it's not
entirely inaccurate.

38:18.751 --> 38:20.375
I knew it.

38:20.375 --> 38:21.209
How are you so sure?

38:21.209 --> 38:25.876
It's my job to read people...
speculate their comfort levels.

38:25.876 --> 38:27.792
I'm a financial trader.

38:28.042 --> 38:31.834
Like the stock market?
Like Uncle Larry?

38:31.834 --> 38:32.626
Random!

38:32.626 --> 38:34.667
[chuckles] I know, right?

38:34.667 --> 38:35.125
I have to admit,

38:35.125 --> 38:36.667
my mind's a little ready
to blow, right now.

38:36.667 --> 38:40.000
I had no idea, and when
you were telling me the story,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.542
the hair on the back of my neck
started standing up.

38:42.542 --> 38:43.709
It was freaky.

38:43.709 --> 38:44.667
I have no words.

38:44.667 --> 38:49.000
I just keep hearing my family
motto running through my mind.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.292
I think I might have to
toss you out again right now.

38:52.292 --> 38:55.292
I did not read you
as a heartless person.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.834
[giggles]
Oh, how did you read me?

38:59.584 --> 39:03.209
I would say you're confident,
a risk taker,

39:03.209 --> 39:07.167
but you probably have
a doable plan B

39:07.167 --> 39:08.918
in case things go south.

39:08.918 --> 39:10.083
Really?

39:10.083 --> 39:13.876
And you're working out
something personal.

39:15.417 --> 39:17.042
Why do you say that?

39:17.042 --> 39:20.334
Why else would someone be
all alone on Christmas

39:20.334 --> 39:23.209
in a cabin
in the middle of nowhere?

39:23.209 --> 39:25.792
Well, when you
put it like that.

39:25.792 --> 39:28.751
So, why aren't you home
with your family and friends?

39:28.751 --> 39:30.876
Or are we expecting company?

39:30.876 --> 39:37.209
Aah, no. It's just me.
I just needed some space.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.334
I love Christmas.

39:38.334 --> 39:42.792
Kids love Christmas.
You love the escape.

39:42.792 --> 39:44.542
Escape from what?

39:44.542 --> 39:46.542
Family. Friends.

39:46.542 --> 39:48.042
I could say
the same about you.

39:48.042 --> 39:51.459
Me? No, I--
I hate Christmas.

39:51.876 --> 39:53.501
How can anyone hate Christmas?

39:53.501 --> 39:56.209
It's surprisingly very easy.

39:56.209 --> 39:57.959
Well, why?

39:57.959 --> 39:59.876
What reindeer
pooped in your stocking?

39:59.876 --> 40:01.709
[Seth laughs]
[Samantha giggles]

40:01.709 --> 40:04.292
No, it's nothing like that.

40:04.292 --> 40:06.584
It's just... ten years ago,

40:06.584 --> 40:10.250
I realized I could use
my time better

40:10.250 --> 40:13.042
at the end of the year,
and it kind of stuck.

40:13.042 --> 40:13.918
Ten years?

40:13.918 --> 40:16.292
Yep, and all the hard work
paid off

40:16.292 --> 40:17.417
because business is booming.

40:17.417 --> 40:20.167
You're telling me
you haven't celebrated Christmas

40:20.167 --> 40:21.375
in ten years?

40:21.375 --> 40:22.542
Yeah.

40:22.542 --> 40:23.209
No presents?

40:23.209 --> 40:24.000
SETH: Nope.
SAMMY: No tree?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.125
SETH: No.
SAMMY: No office
Christmas party?

40:26.125 --> 40:27.751
Only if I'm entertaining
a client,

40:27.751 --> 40:29.250
but even then,
I try to avoid it.

40:29.250 --> 40:31.292
[whispers] Oh, I have no words!

40:31.292 --> 40:32.375
Don't be judgy.

40:32.375 --> 40:34.334
I'm not, it's just...

40:34.334 --> 40:37.834
the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

40:37.834 --> 40:38.542
H-h-hey!

40:38.542 --> 40:40.792
I feel like
you need an intervention.

40:41.042 --> 40:44.918
There's more to life
than just business, Seth.

40:44.918 --> 40:48.292
You know, I happen to
hear that a lot lately.

40:49.000 --> 40:49.792
Well, work is important,

40:49.792 --> 40:54.709
but you have to carve out time
for a little holiday fun.

40:54.709 --> 40:57.876
[sighs]
Yeah, maybe I should.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.792
[shakes dice]

41:07.375 --> 41:10.083
I don't believe it.
Yahtzee!

41:10.083 --> 41:12.000
That is not fair!

41:12.000 --> 41:14.709
[Seth laughs]

41:14.709 --> 41:16.292
Ah!

41:19.834 --> 41:20.709
What's this for?

41:20.709 --> 41:24.542
[sighs] Seems to be
your good luck charm.

41:28.042 --> 41:30.792
And a memento.

41:30.792 --> 41:33.000
Thank you.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.918
Of good times gone by.

41:37.042 --> 41:39.042
Well, I think
this game is over

41:39.042 --> 41:42.375
unless you wanna challenge me
to the best two out of three.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.250
And have you
kick my butt again?

41:44.250 --> 41:45.792
Not tonight.

41:46.542 --> 41:50.042
So-o-o-o,
I guess we have to go

41:50.042 --> 41:53.250
to our own side
of the room now.

41:53.250 --> 41:53.709
Right.

41:53.709 --> 41:56.250
I may have been
a little extreme with the...

41:56.250 --> 41:57.959
The battle lines?

41:57.959 --> 41:59.250
No, I get it.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.876
[sighs] All the same,

42:00.876 --> 42:04.709
it's not exactly demonstrating
goodwill toward man.

42:08.334 --> 42:09.918
[Sammy sighs]

42:16.542 --> 42:18.167
[both chuckle]

42:23.709 --> 42:25.626
Merry Christmas.

42:27.584 --> 42:29.334
So wait,
does this mean that I...

42:29.334 --> 42:32.167
This means you can
walk into the kitchen.

42:32.167 --> 42:33.375
Understood.

42:33.375 --> 42:34.959
[Sammy giggles]

42:34.959 --> 42:37.334
Whoa, it's really late.

42:37.334 --> 42:38.542
Time flies when you're...

42:38.542 --> 42:39.876
Having fun?

42:39.876 --> 42:41.959
[Sammy laughs]

42:42.959 --> 42:45.792
I guess I'll see you
in the morning.

42:45.792 --> 42:47.876
Okay then.
Good night.

42:47.876 --> 42:50.876
Good night.

42:50.876 --> 42:54.959
Oh, are you warm enough?

42:54.959 --> 43:02.792
Actually, I could use another
blanket if you have one.

43:02.792 --> 43:04.417
Hmmpf.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.876
Sorry.

43:12.876 --> 43:14.876
[Seth sighs]

43:14.876 --> 43:16.626
Thank you.

43:19.459 --> 43:21.876
Uh, um, Sammy...

43:21.876 --> 43:24.834
I-- I don't mean to
impose upon your goodwill,

43:24.834 --> 43:28.334
but do you mind
if I could get that uh...

43:30.042 --> 43:31.209
Thank you!

43:31.209 --> 43:35.209
[giggles] Seth, I'm sorry.

43:35.834 --> 43:38.751
No, don't be.
You're right.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.209
It was pretty good payback.

43:41.209 --> 43:42.918
[Sammy chuckles]

43:48.209 --> 43:51.042
Oh, uh, thanks again.

43:51.042 --> 43:54.751
My pleasure, and you're gonna
want to let the water run.

43:54.751 --> 43:57.209
It takes a minute to heat up.

44:02.209 --> 44:04.250
[door closes]

44:39.501 --> 44:41.667
[groans] 'Morning.

44:41.667 --> 44:44.125
We're gonna get outta here
for a little bit.

44:45.959 --> 44:46.709
Can we?

44:46.709 --> 44:47.709
Yep. The storm's past.

44:47.709 --> 44:50.751
We should have clear skies
for a while.

44:50.751 --> 44:53.375
Oh, that's...
that's great news.

44:53.375 --> 44:56.542
[giggles] You really were
going stir-crazy, weren't you?

44:56.542 --> 45:00.584
What? No, no.
I gotta get back.

45:00.584 --> 45:01.167
Get back?

45:01.167 --> 45:03.751
I-- I thought you had to
survey the property.

45:04.542 --> 45:09.000
I did. I-- I do.
But I've lost three days.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.334
So, we still have time
to make the rounds.

45:11.334 --> 45:13.042
Might as well see
what you've inherited.

45:13.042 --> 45:15.709
[brushing teeth]

45:15.709 --> 45:16.667
Some other time.

45:16.667 --> 45:18.959
It's the end of the year,
and...

45:18.959 --> 45:19.626
I gotta get back.

45:19.626 --> 45:22.209
[sighs] I've gotta finalize
a contract with a client

45:22.209 --> 45:24.334
before he leaves for a holiday.

45:24.501 --> 45:28.000
It's two days until Christmas.
Who's really doing work?

45:28.000 --> 45:30.042
[water runs]

45:30.042 --> 45:31.709
[sighs] I am.

45:35.709 --> 45:40.292
Look, Sammy, I really appreciate
all you've done for me.

45:40.292 --> 45:41.042
I-- I do.

45:41.042 --> 45:43.876
I mean, you saved my life
like, twice.

45:43.876 --> 45:48.709
And I can see that it's gonna
take longer than I anticipated.

45:48.709 --> 45:49.709
That's presumptuous.

45:49.709 --> 45:52.209
No, no.
What I mean to say is...

45:52.209 --> 45:52.876
You'll cut your losses

45:52.876 --> 45:55.000
and come back later
with a better offer?

45:55.000 --> 45:59.042
Well, maybe.
I don't... I don't know.

45:59.042 --> 46:02.792
The offer might be
off the table for now.

46:02.792 --> 46:04.709
Oh, that was easy.

46:04.709 --> 46:05.417
No, no, no.

46:05.417 --> 46:07.792
The point is,
there's no rush.

46:07.792 --> 46:10.000
We can work this out later.

46:12.334 --> 46:13.626
Right.

46:13.876 --> 46:15.876
My trip was an imposition
on you

46:15.876 --> 46:17.542
and your charming
little holiday,

46:17.542 --> 46:20.751
and for that, I'm sorry.

46:22.709 --> 46:25.834
What is so important
that you have to go back now?

46:25.834 --> 46:28.542
Hmmpf, why does that matter?

46:28.542 --> 46:31.876
Three days ago,
you were trying to kick me out.

46:32.709 --> 46:33.792
You're right.

46:33.792 --> 46:38.542
I just... I thought
that you were finally...

46:38.542 --> 46:40.709
Well, never mind.

46:45.542 --> 46:48.250
Bye, Seth.
Safe journey back.

46:49.876 --> 46:51.709
[sighs] And Seth...

46:51.709 --> 46:53.417
Don't forget
there's more to life

46:53.417 --> 46:55.375
than just business.

46:55.375 --> 46:58.334
Be sure to close the door
behind you on the way out.

47:01.375 --> 47:03.083
[door closes]

47:11.709 --> 47:13.792
[Seth sighs]

47:23.459 --> 47:25.667
Yeah, why not.

47:34.167 --> 47:37.209
[door closes]

47:37.209 --> 47:38.709
Thank you.

47:43.375 --> 47:45.042
[Seth sighs]

47:56.167 --> 47:57.375
Have I even been
doing this right?

47:57.375 --> 48:01.792
[laughs] How did you ever
get through Old Forks Road?

48:02.542 --> 48:05.250
Dumb luck I suppose.

48:05.250 --> 48:08.501
You know, I could take a day.

48:08.501 --> 48:09.000
Hmmm.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.042
A little room for good
times gone by, I guess.

48:12.042 --> 48:15.375
What about the contract?
What changed your mind?

48:16.834 --> 48:19.542
[sighs] I was
thinking about you.

48:19.542 --> 48:23.792
I, uh, meant
what you said last night.

48:23.792 --> 48:26.334
I guess I could use
an intervention.

48:26.334 --> 48:29.417
Hmmm, yeah.
Let's work on that.

48:29.417 --> 48:30.709
But just a little one

48:30.709 --> 48:34.459
so that I get back before
a client leaves on holiday.

48:34.459 --> 48:35.542
Deal.

48:35.542 --> 48:36.042
Whoa!

48:36.042 --> 48:39.250
♪ It's beginning to look
A lot like Christmas ♪

48:39.250 --> 48:40.375
Baby steps. Please.

48:40.375 --> 48:43.542
[laughs] Oh, come on.

48:43.542 --> 48:45.167
Ugh!

48:50.209 --> 48:52.417
SETH: Ooops!
SAMMY: Whoa!

48:52.709 --> 48:56.042
I don't think I'm ever gonna
get used to these things.

48:57.375 --> 49:00.292
Easy there.
Line in with me.

49:00.292 --> 49:01.876
Try these.

49:03.083 --> 49:04.334
Where were you three days ago?

49:04.334 --> 49:06.167
[chuckles]
Survival of the fittest.

49:06.167 --> 49:08.876
Stick with me
and you might just survive.

49:11.584 --> 49:12.584
Ah! [laughs]

49:12.584 --> 49:15.459
Oh, you should really
use the poles.

49:16.918 --> 49:19.751
[groans] All right!

49:23.709 --> 49:25.292
[Seth groans]

49:27.417 --> 49:29.667
Where are we going?

49:29.667 --> 49:31.209
[Sammy laughs]

49:31.209 --> 49:32.125
Besides down?

49:32.125 --> 49:33.083
Step one of your...

49:33.083 --> 49:35.375
[Seth grunts]
[Sammy laughs]

49:35.375 --> 49:37.417
Step one,
of your intervention,

49:37.417 --> 49:41.334
walking if we can,
in a Winter Wonderland.

49:44.459 --> 49:46.000
[Sammy laughs]

50:03.250 --> 50:07.125
Well, here it is.

50:07.125 --> 50:09.375
Here what is?

50:09.375 --> 50:11.042
Ridge line.

50:11.042 --> 50:16.125
According to that will,
everything here is yours.

50:16.125 --> 50:16.667
I guess.

50:16.667 --> 50:19.834
Wow, I had no idea
it was so...

50:19.834 --> 50:20.250
Big?

50:20.250 --> 50:23.250
[giggles] Yeah, a thousand acres
goes pretty far.

50:23.250 --> 50:25.125
Oh, it's impressive.

50:25.125 --> 50:26.709
[Sammy sighs]

50:27.209 --> 50:28.542
I feel kind of awkward

50:28.542 --> 50:31.083
seeing as how I don't even know
how my uncle acquired it.

50:31.083 --> 50:34.918
Especially after hearing
your family's story.

50:34.918 --> 50:36.834
You mean to tell me
that you acquired

50:36.834 --> 50:39.042
a substantial amount
of God's country

50:39.042 --> 50:41.042
and you have no idea how?

50:41.042 --> 50:45.375
My family isn't...
well, the closest.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.000
That's an understatement.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.501
And you know all of your
extended relatives?

50:49.501 --> 50:50.918
Yeah. I do.

50:50.918 --> 50:52.792
Every other summer,
we come up to the cabin.

50:52.792 --> 50:55.709
This past Fourth of July
was one for the scrapbooks.

50:55.709 --> 50:58.459
Wait, you were just here
for the summer,

50:58.459 --> 51:01.417
and you chose to come back out
for the winter?

51:02.167 --> 51:03.584
Yeah.

51:03.584 --> 51:07.042
The quiet,
the memories.

51:12.083 --> 51:13.667
You're doing it again.

51:13.667 --> 51:15.083
What?

51:15.083 --> 51:15.792
Smiling.

51:15.792 --> 51:17.918
[laughs] I can't help it.

51:17.918 --> 51:20.709
This is a moment
worth smiling about.

51:24.667 --> 51:25.417
[Seth sighs]

51:25.417 --> 51:27.250
SETH: Oh!
[Sammy laughs]

51:27.876 --> 51:30.334
Step two. Get the wall!

51:31.876 --> 51:33.792
[shrieks and laughter]

51:33.792 --> 51:34.918
You're goin' down.

51:34.918 --> 51:38.501
[shrieks and laughter]

51:41.876 --> 51:43.542
You can't do that.

51:43.542 --> 51:45.334
[laughter]

51:50.709 --> 51:52.918
[Seth groans]
[Sammy laughs]

51:59.542 --> 52:03.626
So what's in this manifesto
you're working on?

52:03.626 --> 52:06.542
It's more of a biography.

52:06.542 --> 52:08.083
Oh? About who?

52:08.083 --> 52:12.292
I am profiling the life
of an amazing woman.

52:12.292 --> 52:12.792
Yeah?

52:12.792 --> 52:15.667
Yeah, she was a real
trailblazer for women's sports.

52:15.667 --> 52:16.751
Oh! Really?

52:16.751 --> 52:17.250
Uh-hm.

52:17.250 --> 52:21.167
She won a bronze medal
in the 1948 Olympic Games,

52:21.167 --> 52:23.334
but had a heart of gold.

52:23.334 --> 52:24.042
Wow!

52:24.042 --> 52:24.876
You know, and she just...

52:24.876 --> 52:27.876
she used her platform
to help train young women

52:27.876 --> 52:31.250
to be successful in
whatever they chose to do.

52:31.250 --> 52:33.083
That's impressive.

52:33.083 --> 52:35.375
It is. And she...

52:35.375 --> 52:39.167
she spent her whole life
championing women's causes.

52:39.167 --> 52:42.292
Whew, sounds like
a big responsibility.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.375
It is.

52:43.375 --> 52:46.667
I'd be afraid that I'd miss
the mark on a project like that.

52:46.667 --> 52:51.459
[giggles] Well, fortunately,
I was trained by the best.

52:51.459 --> 52:53.501
Cheers to that.

52:53.501 --> 52:55.167
Cheers.

52:59.542 --> 53:01.459
[both chuckle]

53:01.459 --> 53:04.876
[♪♪♪]

53:36.292 --> 53:39.209
Step six,
and my personal favorite.

53:39.209 --> 53:40.876
Trim up the tree.

53:53.375 --> 53:55.459
[gasps] Oh!

53:58.209 --> 54:02.292
Wow, that looks really... old.

54:02.292 --> 54:05.250
It is. It's
a Great-Grandma Mary ornament.

54:05.250 --> 54:06.834
She made it.

54:06.834 --> 54:07.375
Really?

54:07.375 --> 54:09.459
Yep. And she lived through
the Great Depression.

54:09.459 --> 54:13.209
You had to be very resourceful
in those days.

54:13.209 --> 54:16.000
Now I know where
you get it from.

54:17.876 --> 54:21.709
And her talents were not
limited to just sewing.

54:21.709 --> 54:24.417
You see that wreath over there?

54:24.417 --> 54:28.918
You mean, this raggedy
old gaudy gold thing?

54:28.918 --> 54:30.709
Don't be judgy!

54:30.709 --> 54:34.667
I'm not.
It's-- it's very shiny.

54:36.375 --> 54:38.792
It's made of ham cans.

54:40.042 --> 54:42.083
SETH: What?
[Sammy giggles]

54:47.167 --> 54:47.959
What?

54:47.959 --> 54:50.292
Would you look at that?

54:50.292 --> 54:52.000
How did she even do this?

54:52.000 --> 54:55.542
With pinking shears
and a lot of patience.

54:57.501 --> 55:00.501
I mean, where would she even
find the time to do this?

55:00.501 --> 55:02.918
It looks like it took hours.

55:02.918 --> 55:04.542
Probably one of
those long winter days

55:04.542 --> 55:07.459
when going outside
wasn't really an option.

55:08.709 --> 55:11.667
Hmmpf. I could think of
a few other things

55:11.667 --> 55:15.334
to occupy my time
like day trading or...

55:15.334 --> 55:16.459
SETH: Ouch!
SAMMY: Oh!

55:16.459 --> 55:20.292
Careful! The wreath bites.
[laughs]

55:20.292 --> 55:20.792
Come on.

55:20.792 --> 55:23.834
Come help me put together
Great-Grandma Mary's tree.

55:28.459 --> 55:31.125
What do you mean
"put it together"?

55:36.751 --> 55:38.417
Ta-da!

55:43.083 --> 55:46.000
This is the first time
I'm doing it,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.375
how am I supposed to help?

55:48.375 --> 55:52.250
A notch for every... piece.

55:52.834 --> 55:55.000
And you have to push it in
like kind of far.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.667
Really. Wow.

55:58.667 --> 56:00.417
Wh-o-o-o-a.

56:04.709 --> 56:06.167
Give it to me. [laughs]

56:06.167 --> 56:08.417
You win. It's your tree.

56:10.375 --> 56:12.751
Oooh, it looks so good!

56:26.584 --> 56:28.542
It's a lot nicer than mine.

56:28.542 --> 56:30.792
[giggles] Show me
how you can juggle.

56:30.792 --> 56:32.584
SETH: I just uh...
SAMMY: Don't break any!

56:32.584 --> 56:34.834
Look at this one!

56:34.834 --> 56:37.751
SETH: Cute.
SAMMY: It's amazing.

56:37.751 --> 56:39.959
I love it. Perfect!

56:40.501 --> 56:42.209
Oh, ice skates.

56:42.209 --> 56:43.709
[indistinct]

56:43.709 --> 56:45.918
Don't waste that on the tree.
You keep that.

56:45.918 --> 56:46.751
[giggles] Pinecones.

56:46.751 --> 56:50.459
My mom used to make
these reindeer out of them.

56:50.459 --> 56:53.083
She would put like
a pipe cleaner around here

56:53.083 --> 56:53.959
and make like, the antlers,

56:53.959 --> 56:56.375
and then, put two little eyes
on the either side.

56:56.375 --> 56:59.209
So cute!
We had tons of 'em.

56:59.209 --> 57:00.626
And this...

57:00.626 --> 57:02.459
Ah yeah.
Oh, you figured that out.

57:02.459 --> 57:03.709
[Sammy laughs]

57:03.709 --> 57:04.876
Ha-ha-ha.

57:04.876 --> 57:07.834
SAMMY: Ah!
SETH: We've gotta be
close to the end.

57:07.834 --> 57:09.417
[Sammy giggles]

57:10.000 --> 57:12.459
SETH: This one's actually...
SAMMY: Here.

57:20.959 --> 57:23.667
SAMMY: Is it going to light?
SETH: Pressure.

57:23.667 --> 57:24.334
The pressure's on

57:24.334 --> 57:26.459
'cause it's going to be
hard to get that one.

57:26.459 --> 57:28.042
Oh, I see.

57:28.042 --> 57:31.209
It won't stay. [laughs]

57:32.000 --> 57:33.626
[strikes match]

57:47.167 --> 57:49.876
Ah, good work.

58:02.209 --> 58:03.709
Oooh!

58:05.792 --> 58:07.542
All right!

58:07.542 --> 58:09.501
[giggles] One.

58:09.501 --> 58:11.209
At this rate,
by next Christmas...

58:11.209 --> 58:12.584
[Sammy giggles]

58:12.584 --> 58:14.542
We'll have one string.

58:14.542 --> 58:18.334
I didn't break that last one
because I'm a genius.

58:18.334 --> 58:19.709
Look.

58:19.709 --> 58:20.959
That's pathetic.

58:20.959 --> 58:22.375
That's progress.

58:22.375 --> 58:23.918
[laughs] Ah.

58:26.626 --> 58:29.250
SETH: All right. That's...
SAMMY: Back to one.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.584
One hour
down the drain.

58:30.584 --> 58:33.375
[Sammy laughs]
SETH: Right.

58:44.125 --> 58:46.626
What about that gold one?

58:46.626 --> 58:48.918
That is a miniature gymnast

58:48.918 --> 58:51.292
that was given to me
in eighth grade.

58:51.292 --> 58:52.083
Were you a gymnast?

58:52.083 --> 58:55.417
No! The Summer Olympics
was a few months earlier.

58:55.417 --> 59:00.042
Nana thought I would aspire
to be an Olympian.

59:00.042 --> 59:01.125
Did it work?

59:01.125 --> 59:03.209
[giggles] Also a no.

59:03.209 --> 59:05.918
I was terribly klutzy as a kid

59:05.918 --> 59:08.584
which is why I stuck
with the books.

59:08.584 --> 59:11.375
Oh, so that is
why you are a...

59:11.375 --> 59:15.459
Writer. Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

59:15.459 --> 59:20.626
Well, that and... Nana.

59:20.626 --> 59:23.167
Oh, yeah?

59:23.167 --> 59:27.167
Nana was the Olympian.

59:27.167 --> 59:29.375
[sobs]

59:29.375 --> 59:31.834
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you...

59:31.834 --> 59:36.501
It's okay.
She passed away last summer.

59:36.501 --> 59:39.250
That's why I came up
to the cabin.

59:39.250 --> 59:41.834
She practically raised
my brother Josh and me

59:41.834 --> 59:43.334
in the summers.

59:43.334 --> 59:46.083
She loved this place.

59:46.083 --> 59:48.792
I guess I felt that somehow
by being here,

59:48.792 --> 59:51.209
she wouldn't feel so far away.

59:51.876 --> 59:54.751
Well, that's an adorable
gesture.

59:54.751 --> 59:56.000
Tell that to Josh.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.501
[sighs] I bailed on Christmas
again this year.

59:59.501 --> 01:00:01.792
I'm sure he understands.

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:02.209
No.

01:00:02.209 --> 01:00:07.209
I mean, Christmas is about
being with the ones you love.

01:00:07.209 --> 01:00:08.876
I just didn't have the heart
to tell him

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:12.125
I was still processing it all.

01:00:13.459 --> 01:00:18.751
I told him I was... working.

01:00:18.751 --> 01:00:21.876
And here I thought
no one works before Christmas.

01:00:21.876 --> 01:00:25.209
Yeah, I guess
that wasn't very fair of me.

01:00:26.709 --> 01:00:31.209
So, do you need to go
back to work?

01:00:31.209 --> 01:00:36.459
No, I'm happy
where I'm at right now.

01:00:36.459 --> 01:00:37.292
Today's a gift,

01:00:37.292 --> 01:00:40.375
and that's why
it's called the present.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:43.042
And where did that come from?

01:00:43.626 --> 01:00:49.083
I heard that from
a very feisty and wise lady.

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:51.918
And I now understand
what she meant.

01:00:51.918 --> 01:00:55.542
Why Seth, I do believe
you're well on your way

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:57.083
to a full recovery.

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.167
Oh really?

01:00:58.167 --> 01:00:58.709
[giggles] Yes!

01:00:58.709 --> 01:01:02.250
I think you just jumped ahead
to the 12th step.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:06.250
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.542
I will. Thank you.

01:01:08.542 --> 01:01:11.709
Oh my gosh,
I almost forgot!

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:13.834
[Sammy sighs]

01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:18.584
[gasps] Oooh!

01:01:23.209 --> 01:01:26.167
I didn't realize
we were doing gifts.

01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:29.459
No, it's from my Nana.

01:01:29.459 --> 01:01:32.334
We just met three days ago.

01:01:32.334 --> 01:01:35.209
Is there something
I should know about?

01:01:35.209 --> 01:01:37.834
No. It's for me.

01:01:37.834 --> 01:01:40.083
Nana used to buy them
months in advance.

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:40.751
Oh, that's thoughtful.

01:01:40.751 --> 01:01:43.709
Yeah. We found them when
we were cleaning out her house.

01:01:43.709 --> 01:01:46.334
And that's a little creepy.

01:01:46.334 --> 01:01:48.667
No, it's gonna be lovely.

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:54.584
Nana had a very particular
taste in Christmas decorations.

01:01:54.584 --> 01:01:58.042
[opening package]

01:02:03.709 --> 01:02:07.834
Wow, it's a... Yeah, wow.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:09.000
Oh!

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.375
The gawdier the better.

01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.042
Awww!

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.000
Oh! Oh, it lights up!

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.375
[Seth scoffs]

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:23.751
I'll treasure this forever.

01:02:23.751 --> 01:02:25.501
Where are you gonna put it?

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.709
Right there.

01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:44.334
Sammy... thank you.

01:03:34.209 --> 01:03:37.667
[cooking sizzles]

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:48.584
'Morning, sleepy.

01:03:48.584 --> 01:03:51.959
[giggles]
What time is it?

01:03:51.959 --> 01:03:53.542
10:30.

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:54.918
Wow!

01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:05.459
Lovely. Thank you.

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:11.501
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:14.209
It is.
Merry Christmas Eve to you.

01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:15.751
[mugs clang in toast]

01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:19.417
I hope you don't mind.
I just grabbed

01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:20.876
what I could find
out of the fridge.

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:24.042
Not at all.
I love bacon bits.

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:25.542
Breakfast of champions.

01:04:25.542 --> 01:04:26.083
[Sammy giggles]

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:28.542
I figured we'd fuel up
before heading out.

01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:30.375
Out?

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:33.959
Yeah. I thought we'd explore
the south side of the property.

01:04:33.959 --> 01:04:35.459
Is there anything
interesting there?

01:04:35.459 --> 01:04:37.459
Yeah. Actually,
there's a waterfall

01:04:37.459 --> 01:04:39.250
about half a mile down.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:39.834
It's frozen over,

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.876
but it's still probably
a beautiful sight to see.

01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:43.792
It's a date.

01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:47.792
Okay then.
We'll head out after breakfast.

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:50.083
How do you like your eggs?

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:54.000
Oh, um, over easy, please.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.501
Comin' right up.

01:05:00.792 --> 01:05:03.250
Um, I'm gonna freshen up.

01:05:03.876 --> 01:05:07.792
You better hurry up.
Breakfast will be ready soon.

01:05:49.334 --> 01:05:50.709
Ready to go?

01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:58.542
SETH: Lead the way.
SAMMY: All right.

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:02.459
Hey, this place
looks familiar.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:03.000
It should.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.876
About a quarter mile down is uh,
the entrance to Old Forks Road.

01:06:09.876 --> 01:06:13.125
This is the cell tree.

01:06:13.125 --> 01:06:14.542
It's the last place
you can get reception

01:06:14.542 --> 01:06:17.375
before you hit the cabin.

01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:19.042
Can't miss it.

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:22.042
[texts loading]
What the--

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:25.167
See? Works every time.

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.626
Oh, my gosh!

01:06:28.626 --> 01:06:30.709
Oh-oh! Looks like
they found you.

01:06:30.709 --> 01:06:32.792
Oh, this is not good.

01:06:32.792 --> 01:06:36.042
What? You okay?

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:37.209
[texting] Um, yeah.

01:06:37.209 --> 01:06:41.834
Listen, Sammy...
I might have to go.

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:44.626
Go? Go where?

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:48.000
Home. The Mathis deal
I was working on

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.375
before I came here...
fell apart.

01:06:53.334 --> 01:06:58.417
Hello? Hello.
Octavia, can you hear me?

01:06:58.417 --> 01:07:00.542
Of course, I'm alive.

01:07:00.542 --> 01:07:04.459
Yes, yes, I know.
I just got distracted.

01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:07.334
What? No, it's not important.

01:07:07.334 --> 01:07:09.626
No, I am. Right away.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:11.292
Octavia, listen,
you're breaking up.

01:07:11.292 --> 01:07:15.834
Let me call you back
in about an hour, okay?

01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:16.667
Yes, yes.

01:07:16.667 --> 01:07:19.334
Just call them
and tell them to hold on.

01:07:19.334 --> 01:07:20.876
I am on my way.

01:07:20.876 --> 01:07:21.459
[Seth sighs]

01:07:21.459 --> 01:07:26.125
So, whatever it is,
I'm sure it's not that bad.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:30.459
I'm sorry, Sammy,
but I have to leave like now.

01:07:30.459 --> 01:07:33.209
Seth... Seth, wait.

01:07:33.209 --> 01:07:36.626
Hold on!
Would you slow down?

01:07:36.626 --> 01:07:39.209
I can't. I've really
gotta get back.

01:07:39.209 --> 01:07:40.542
So you're really
just gonna leave?

01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:42.000
SETH: Yes!
SAMMY: Just like that?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.209
Yes, like that.

01:07:43.209 --> 01:07:45.042
I'm sorry if that makes me
a jerk, but...

01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:47.792
Don't be like that.
I didn't say that.

01:07:47.792 --> 01:07:48.834
Be like what?

01:07:48.834 --> 01:07:54.459
Just make sure that whatever
you're looking for is worth it.

01:07:54.459 --> 01:08:01.042
Sammy, I gotta go back
and fix this.

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:04.167
Okay. I understand.

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.042
But how are you even
gonna get a flight?

01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:08.083
It's Christmas Eve.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:08.542
I dunno.

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:10.375
I should have thought
about that a few days ago

01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:12.834
before I got stuck out here.

01:08:12.834 --> 01:08:14.125
Well, I didn't exactly
tie you up,

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:17.876
and if I remember correctly,
I saved your life.

01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:19.292
Like twice.

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:24.292
And where are you going?
The cabin's this way.

01:08:25.834 --> 01:08:29.459
And this is what it looks like
when a Whetly walks away.

01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:39.042
Sammy! Sammy, wait!

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.042
[Sammy slams door]

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:53.667
Sammy... I don't
mean it that way.

01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:54.459
Close the door, please.

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:56.917
You're letting out
all the hot air.

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:02.626
[Seth sighs]

01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:15.417
[opens and closes door]
You're still here.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:18.209
I'll be out of your hair
in just a minute.

01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:20.042
[glass breaking]

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:22.375
[upset tone]
What did you do?

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.417
SAMMY: No!
SETH: I am so sorry.

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:29.250
God, Seth...
please just back up.

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.209
I got this.

01:09:30.209 --> 01:09:32.459
I'm sorry, Sam.
I really am.

01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:33.917
Seth, please.

01:09:43.959 --> 01:09:46.876
I really screwed this up,
haven't I?

01:09:46.876 --> 01:09:48.125
It's fine.

01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:51.501
[sobs] I shouldn't be
so careless with my things.

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:58.667
You really should get going
if you're going to make it back.

01:10:06.584 --> 01:10:12.083
Seth, I really do hope
you have a safe journey.

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:54.751
[door closes]

01:12:30.042 --> 01:12:32.167
[glass falls to table]
[Sammy sighs]

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:45.834
[sniffling]

01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:27.083
[chatter]
JOSH: Oh, thank you very much.

01:13:31.334 --> 01:13:33.042
[Sammy sighs]

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:36.626
[cell phone buzzing]

01:13:36.626 --> 01:13:40.918
Hello there, Sis.
Merry Christmas.

01:13:40.918 --> 01:13:42.459
Merry Christmas, Josh.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:43.375
How's the weather holdin' up?

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.542
It's lookin' a little hairy
on the news.

01:13:45.542 --> 01:13:47.459
Nothin' I can't handle.

01:13:47.459 --> 01:13:50.918
Did you open Nana's gift yet?

01:13:50.918 --> 01:13:52.375
Yeah, yeah, I did.

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:55.417
Well, don't keep me hanging.
What was it?

01:13:55.417 --> 01:13:56.876
It was this, um, [giggles],
this--

01:13:56.876 --> 01:14:00.542
this statue of the Nativity
with this battery-powered candle

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:04.375
perpetually lighting up
the manger.

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:05.501
It's so perfect!

01:14:05.501 --> 01:14:09.209
She always knew
you loved Nativities.

01:14:09.209 --> 01:14:11.209
[sobs] Yeah.

01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:13.209
Oh? I'm sorry, Sammy.

01:14:13.209 --> 01:14:14.584
Don't cry.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.083
You know, she's looking down
right now,

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:17.918
having a good laugh of her own.

01:14:17.918 --> 01:14:21.125
Yeah, yeah, I bet she is.
[sniffling]

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:24.792
I'm sorry. I wish
I could give you a hug.

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:27.125
I could really
use one right now.

01:14:28.417 --> 01:14:31.334
Hey, how's the book
coming along?

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:34.209
Yeah. Good.
Yeah, it's great.

01:14:34.209 --> 01:14:37.751
Good, that means
your trip was worth it.

01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:39.375
[Sammy sniffling]

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.209
I shouldn't have bailed, Josh.

01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:42.000
I'm so sorry.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.876
Don't be. I'm just sad
you're alone for the holiday.

01:14:45.876 --> 01:14:46.876
Ugh!

01:14:46.876 --> 01:14:49.167
You needed this trip.

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:50.834
[sniffling] Yeah, I did.

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:55.667
Hey look, it's...
it's really cold out here.

01:14:55.667 --> 01:14:58.042
So I'm going to
let you go, okay?

01:14:58.042 --> 01:14:59.667
Okay.

01:14:59.667 --> 01:15:03.876
Miss you, Sis,
and I'm sending you a big hug.

01:15:03.876 --> 01:15:05.375
Thanks, Bud.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:08.501
Give my love and hugs
to everyone, okay?

01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:12.042
Merry Christmas, Sammy.
Love you.

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:14.751
Merry Christmas, Josh.
Love you.

01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:25.334
[Sammy sniffling]

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:33.876
Yes, just book it.

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:38.292
But you'll have three layovers
and you'll be traveling all day.

01:15:38.292 --> 01:15:39.417
Look, I don't care.

01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:42.125
The point is I will
get there eventually.

01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:44.125
But it's Christmas, Seth.

01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.167
So?

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:47.250
I've got presents to unwrap.

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:49.959
[sighs] Octavia,
I have to fix this deal.

01:15:49.959 --> 01:15:53.542
Listen, Seth, Christmas
may mean nothing to you,

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:54.709
but here in the real world,

01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:56.834
we appreciate
this time of the year.

01:15:56.834 --> 01:15:59.626
Octavia, just get this flight
through and I will...

01:15:59.626 --> 01:16:02.209
I will give you
the first two weeks off

01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:03.459
in January, I swear.

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:07.209
There's more to life
than business, Seth.

01:16:08.542 --> 01:16:11.584
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

01:16:11.584 --> 01:16:12.584
Because it's true.

01:16:12.584 --> 01:16:16.042
Today is a gift, that's why
they call it the present.

01:16:16.042 --> 01:16:21.042
Now, I'm a wise woman, Seth.
You'll do best to listen to me.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:21.918
But the...

01:16:21.918 --> 01:16:24.542
But nothing.
The Marshalls have already left.

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:26.375
But there's still
a chance that...

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:29.167
They are in St. Croix, Seth,
and you flying in

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:33.542
and crashing their Christmas
isn't a smart plan.

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:35.751
Oh! Well,
when you put it that way.

01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:38.709
Just face it, there's nothing
you can do to fix this deal

01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:41.209
until next year.

01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:44.542
[sighs] Ugh, Octavia...
what am I gonna do?

01:16:44.542 --> 01:16:46.751
I'm gonna tell you
what you're gonna do.

01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:49.375
Seth, you're gonna
have yourself

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.417
a merry little Christmas.

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:53.876
Now go do whatever it is
you need to do

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:55.626
to figure that out.

01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:04.709
You're right.
Octavia, you are so right.

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:06.292
Yes, I am.

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:09.584
Thank you for
expanding your mind.

01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:12.542
[sighs] I am such an idiot!

01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:13.209
Now I didn't say that,

01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:16.042
but if you feel the need
to be honest with yourself,

01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:17.375
who am I to stop you.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:23.501
[snickers]
Octavia, thank you.

01:17:23.501 --> 01:17:24.584
You're welcome.

01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:26.959
And I'll take you up
on that two-week offer.

01:17:26.959 --> 01:17:28.334
Oh, wait a minute.

01:17:28.334 --> 01:17:32.250
See you mid-January.
Merry Christmas.

01:17:33.834 --> 01:17:37.751
Lord have mercy,
that boy needs a woman!

01:17:44.876 --> 01:17:48.375
[store bell rings]

01:17:54.667 --> 01:17:57.542
Good morning, Mr. Gatly,
and Merry Christmas.

01:17:57.542 --> 01:17:59.334
Well, if it isn't
the city boy.

01:17:59.334 --> 01:18:01.083
I thought you'd be
long gone by now.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:03.834
Nope. I was
unexpectedly delayed,

01:18:03.834 --> 01:18:05.918
but it was a good thing.

01:18:05.918 --> 01:18:08.751
Did you ever get that sign-off
on that property you wanted?

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:11.709
You know, I got
something better.

01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:13.250
I'm actually
heading back there now.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:16.626
Oh no, not now.
You-you can't get through.

01:18:16.626 --> 01:18:19.918
It's all over the news.
There's an avalanche.

01:18:19.918 --> 01:18:21.792
Closed the pass down.

01:18:21.792 --> 01:18:22.834
Avalanche?

01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:23.959
Yeah. It's a big one, too.

01:18:23.959 --> 01:18:25.959
Blizzard brought in
a record amount of snow.

01:18:25.959 --> 01:18:27.918
It gave way and closed the pass.

01:18:27.918 --> 01:18:30.000
But Sammy is still up there.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.834
I'm afraid there's no
gettin' in on Old Forks Road.

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:35.667
Well, how am I
gonna get to her?

01:18:35.667 --> 01:18:36.584
I mean, she's all
alone up there.

01:18:36.584 --> 01:18:38.751
There's no cell service.
She could be in danger.

01:18:38.751 --> 01:18:44.584
Well, I guess, uh...
Parker Pass is still open.

01:18:44.584 --> 01:18:45.918
You could get in that way.

01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:47.209
And you know how to get there?

01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.834
Of course, I do.

01:18:47.834 --> 01:18:51.334
I got my first billy goat
up by Parker Ridge.

01:18:51.334 --> 01:18:53.209
[gasps] Of course you did.

01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:57.209
[chuckles] I'll show you.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.542
This is us here, okay?

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:04.626
Right? Gotta go straight...

01:19:31.876 --> 01:19:35.542
[text messages loading]

01:20:07.918 --> 01:20:09.959
[knock on door]

01:20:10.751 --> 01:20:12.042
Hello?

01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:21.834
Who is it?

01:20:23.375 --> 01:20:27.501
It's uh, Seth.
Seth Walker.

01:20:29.751 --> 01:20:32.667
Don't know if I know
any Seth Walkers.

01:20:32.667 --> 01:20:39.918
[chuckles] Um... yeah.
We met the other day.

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:43.542
Are you sure you don't have
anywhere else you need to be?

01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:49.209
I'm sure.
I-I just need to...

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:53.792
Hi.

01:20:53.792 --> 01:20:55.709
Hi.

01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:57.876
I just need to be with you.

01:20:57.876 --> 01:21:01.250
I really... just need to
be with you.

01:21:08.626 --> 01:21:09.834
Merry Christmas.

01:21:09.834 --> 01:21:12.209
[giggles] What?

01:21:12.209 --> 01:21:13.876
Go ahead, open it.

01:21:16.834 --> 01:21:17.334
Uh-hm.

01:21:17.334 --> 01:21:20.501
I sort of... fell down
the mountain on my way over.

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:21.918
[Sammy laughs]

01:21:23.334 --> 01:21:27.542
Oh, it's perfect.

01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:29.876
[Sammy laughs]

01:21:34.876 --> 01:21:36.709
I didn't see anybody
come up the path.

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:40.292
Old Forks Road was closed
due to an avalanche.

01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:41.876
An avalanche?

01:21:41.876 --> 01:21:42.709
Yeah.

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:46.375
No! Oh my gosh!
How did you get here?

01:21:46.375 --> 01:21:48.584
I had to use uh, Parker Pass.

01:21:48.584 --> 01:21:49.751
Parker Pass?

01:21:49.751 --> 01:21:51.918
Yeah. Cuts right through
my land.

01:21:51.918 --> 01:21:54.167
I ended up on Walker Ridge.

01:21:54.167 --> 01:21:56.751
Seth, they call it
Walker Ridge

01:21:56.751 --> 01:21:59.459
because you can see
the property line.

01:21:59.459 --> 01:22:00.375
Okay...

01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:04.042
Old Forks Road
is the property line.

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:05.709
Everything to the west of it
is yours.

01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:09.584
Everything to the east of it
belongs to the Whetlys.

01:22:09.584 --> 01:22:11.751
So that makes the cabin...

01:22:11.751 --> 01:22:14.000
Smack dab in the middle.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.083
Fifty-fifty.

01:22:15.083 --> 01:22:16.918
[laughs] For better or worse.

01:22:16.918 --> 01:22:18.375
[Seth chuckles]

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.375
Merry Christmas, Seth.

01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:22.876
It's a very merry Christmas,
indeed.

01:22:22.876 --> 01:22:27.125
I just wish that I had
a gift to give you.

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:29.083
You already did.

01:22:29.083 --> 01:22:30.792
What?

01:22:30.792 --> 01:22:33.167
[Sammy laughs]

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.709
You're here.
Today's a gift.

01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:40.125
That's all the present I need.
