02:10.964 --> 02:13.546
Almost reminds you of Krypton,
doesn't it?

02:15.886 --> 02:17.376
Who are you?

02:17.554 --> 02:21.297
The answer to many
of your unanswered questions.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.184
I seriously think
you have the wrong farmhouse.

02:26.355 --> 02:30.473
I'd have expected a girl raised
by such a stoic race to be a better liar.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.060
But you're just as transparent as Kal-El.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.241
-How do you know Kal-El?
-l've been watching.

Only because you have no option to return,
but you would, wouldn't you?

You have to miss the way things
used to be.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.098
Getting your memory back
must have been...

03:04.768 --> 03:06.349
...a disappointment.

03:07.563 --> 03:09.724
I like my life here.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.727
And I think you should leave.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.479
That's a valiant effort.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.278
But it's not the truth.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.868
What if I told you...

03:25.038 --> 03:27.495
...that there was a way to go back?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.699
To save everyone you loved?

03:32.170 --> 03:36.413
I'd say you weren't the ﬁrst Kryptonian
to use those memories against me.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.381
And it won't work.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.886
That's unfortunate...

03:44.391 --> 03:46.427
...because I need you.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.344
Sorry. That's not my problem.

I didn't ask nicely.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.824
If we'd have done this my way...

04:12.002 --> 04:13.663
...no one would've gotten hurt.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.243
Why didn't you tell me there
was another Kryptonian?

05:33.417 --> 05:37.035
You were halfway across the country
with no memory. He's not a guy.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.998

against this thing...

05:50.350 --> 05:52.682

Your father.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.360
He made bad choices toward the end.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.120
Is it possible that he and Zod were allies?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.372
Never.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.786
If there's one thing that our fathers
agreed on, it was their hatred for Zod.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.710
Then why has he turned his attention
toward you?

06:25.677 --> 06:27.258
I don't know.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.766
But when we go up against him...

06:31.933 --> 06:35.391

if we were all in the same playing ﬁeld.

21:37.588 --> 21:38.703
What is it?

21:38.881 --> 21:42.715
A massive power surge ﬂared up
in Metropolis right near the Isis Foundation.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.385

22:00.695 --> 22:02.310
-C|ark. |--
-Save it for the police.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.070
-No, please. I came to see Lana.
-Lana.

22:05.241 --> 22:09.109
I'd hoped she could talk some sense into
you, but we're running out of time, son.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.321
You must listen to me.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.613
CLARK: You destroyed the life of one son.
You don't get a second chance.

22:13.791 --> 22:17.124
The only real son you have hates you
just as much as I do.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.786
That-- That doesn't matter,
but you've gotta listen to me. Please.

22:20.965 --> 22:24.298
It doesn't, because you're just gonna
wash your hands of it, aren't you?

22:24.468 --> 22:27.960
Just like you did when you murdered
Dr. Swann and the Queens?

22:28.139 --> 22:31.097
You haven't changed.
Patricia told me and you killed her for it.

22:31.267 --> 22:35.431
No. Clark, no. I'd never--

22:37.189 --> 22:43.435

what you think of me, but |— Oh, God.

I should have listened to my father.

22:51.787 --> 22:55.575
l was stupid to think you could care
about anyone other than yourself.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.782
You're less human than I am.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.043

I must give you.

Here, take this. Please.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.665
There's nothing you have that I want.
Now, where's Lana?

23:05.843 --> 23:10.553
I don't know. The receptionist said
she had a visitor and then she left.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.306
Visitor.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.308
Lana.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.152
Lana.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.323
Thank God you weren't at Isis.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.236

to ﬁnd you.

No.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.609
No. Lana?

24:13.869 --> 24:16.030
So much for teamwork.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.615
Why'd you disappear on me?

24:17.790 --> 24:21.578
I thought you were gonna check in with me
when you and Chloe found Brainiac.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.165
Clark, what's wrong?

24:27.383 --> 24:28.372
What happened?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.639
It's Brainiac. He's done something.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.307
It was supposed to be me.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.600
Lana, please.

25:31.822 --> 25:35.189
Well, it kind of takes the intrigue
out of breaking and entering.

25:37.328 --> 25:41.537
So why do you think that Lionel's sharing
his deep, dark murderous secrets with Lana?

25:41.707 --> 25:45.620
He left his ofﬁce and came straight here.
Just look around.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.638

26:08.400 --> 26:12.814

-Creepy.

No way.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.671
Who is that?

26:37.012 --> 26:40.504
Patricia Swann's driver-slash-suspected-
killer who's vanished.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.514
Right.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.183
And that's signiﬁcant because...?

"Lana, I'm innocent,
you have to believe me.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.854
I need your help. Lionel."

26:53.570 --> 26:57.358
The guy who killed Patricia Swann
wasn't hired by Lionel.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.988
He was working for Lex.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.140

I hope you found the bank.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.721
Sir, we traced the key
to the National Depository of Switzerland...

27:26.895 --> 27:28.226
...but we hit a roadblock.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.264
When we're this close,
I think it's fair to say...

27:31.442 --> 27:34.934
...that persuading a gloriﬁed teller
should be the least of our worries.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.070
If someone's holding out,
pay them whatever they're asking.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.653
Sir, this bank held off the Third Reich,
the Sicilian Maﬁa and al Qaeda.

27:41.827 --> 27:45.069
With all due respect,
I'm fairly certain they won't bow to you.

27:45.247 --> 27:48.910
I don't understand. If they're
requiring authorization, that's not an issue.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.200
-We have the key.
-We have one key.

27:51.962 --> 27:55.921
Each safety deposit box
in the high security vault requires two.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.915
Two?

27:59.345 --> 28:04.556

the other, but we don't have any leads.

The Traveler is useless to us
unless we can control him.

Just outside the city called Smallville.

Okay. Let's go.

for the key.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.263

31:34.810 --> 31:38.018
A little adjustment
to her central nervous system.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.474
Absolutely irreversible

31:40.649 --> 31:42.435

31:48.824 --> 31:51.611
I'm afraid that she is suffering.

There's part of Lana that's completely
aware of what's happening around her...

31:57.374 --> 31:59.990
...but she has no control over her body.

32:00.669 --> 32:05.459

34:12.968 --> 34:15.459

34:16.763 --> 34:18.549

to be his vessel, his emissary.
