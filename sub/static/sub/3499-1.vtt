00:14.758 --> 00:18.229
<i>In the second age the War of Gods intensified.</i>

00:18.249 --> 00:21.276
<i>As battles raged and the
Gods ravaged the land,</i>

00:21.296 --> 00:24.717
<i>survivors became few and scattered.</i>

00:24.736 --> 00:26.571
<i>The Humans forged the Order,</i>

00:26.587 --> 00:29.442
<i>a desperate alliance with Elves and Dwarves.</i>

00:29.458 --> 00:34.088
<i>This ended the war, forcing the Orcs
and Dark Elves deep into the wastelands.</i>

00:34.110 --> 00:36.961
<i>As the Order struggled to restore civilization</i>

00:36.981 --> 00:41.033
<i>the Prophets were tormented by
visions of a growing darkness in the West.</i>

00:41.053 --> 00:44.717
<i>An ancient evil rekindled...</i>

00:44.737 --> 00:47.817
<i>In the dim corners of taverns and caverns</i>

00:47.837 --> 00:52.702
<i>whisperings were heard of a syndicate
of conspirators known as the Shadow.</i>

00:52.722 --> 00:56.606
<i>In the lawless borderlands between
Battle Grave and Waspire</i>

00:56.626 --> 00:59.199
<i>operatives of the Shadow emerged.</i>

00:59.219 --> 01:03.414
<i>The prophets dispatched agents
of their own to uncover the origin</i>

01:03.434 --> 01:07.404
<i>and intentions of the Shadow Cabal.</i>

03:18.936 --> 03:21.470
You've been busy, Fang-Tor Bloodmoon.

03:21.497 --> 03:27.053
Murder, rape, arson,
desecration of a Holy Relic.

03:30.472 --> 03:34.440
I have gold. Walk away.

03:34.530 --> 03:37.295
And I'll give you double.

07:54.170 --> 07:59.416
We don't need it.
We do, we do need...

07:59.436 --> 08:03.230
What, who's there?

08:03.775 --> 08:07.841
Is that you, Gyarmuck?
- What does he want?

08:07.871 --> 08:10.527
I'll have some words with you.

08:27.104 --> 08:29.838
You've been tracking me, Keltus.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.787
The gods be damned!
Order sent you.

08:32.856 --> 08:36.823
I need some answers.
- I answer to no one

08:36.847 --> 08:39.163
but the Shadow now.

08:39.405 --> 08:42.083
That answers at least two of my questions.

08:47.837 --> 08:50.161
You have come a long way
for me, Keltus.

08:50.181 --> 08:53.355
Loyal lapdog of the Prophetess!

08:53.375 --> 08:57.448
They say you're hard
to kill. For a human.

08:57.468 --> 09:00.688
But Humans can't see in
the dark, can they?

09:00.708 --> 09:05.402
No, but I can hear a loud
mouthed Dwarf well enough.

09:36.950 --> 09:40.395
I'd rather not kill you,
I need information.

09:40.415 --> 09:45.637
The Order hangs by a thread, Keltus.

09:45.942 --> 09:50.876
Take up with the Rising Shadow.
Join our cause!

09:50.896 --> 09:52.743
Your part is said.

09:52.763 --> 09:57.435
Now tell me, why the Shadow is
gathering here in the North

09:57.455 --> 09:59.860
and the identity of your contact.

09:59.880 --> 10:04.347
In a few days, the God
of Death will awaken

10:04.367 --> 10:07.984
and then you will have your answers.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.822
My Lady is impatient, Dwarf.

10:10.842 --> 10:14.074
Now, tell me or die.
- Die?

10:14.977 --> 10:19.050
You fear death.
I only fear its master.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.773
I'm going to tell you nothing.

10:21.798 --> 10:26.305
So be it!
Give my regards to your master.

10:43.544 --> 10:48.754
The Shadow grows with
every life that is taken.

10:49.906 --> 10:53.136
When Kullimon's raiders
bring us the vessel

10:53.156 --> 10:58.054
not even the Gods will
stand against our power.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.254
Kullimon's raiders?
Thank you.

11:01.274 --> 11:03.647
That's just what I needed to know.

11:04.262 --> 11:08.595
You're welcome. Now die!

11:08.615 --> 11:11.541
In pieces!

11:16.778 --> 11:18.692
Oh! Gee.

12:00.102 --> 12:02.340
<font color="#ffff00">Against my will</font>

12:02.366 --> 12:05.708
<font color="#ffff00">Mulgrut has raided for
an agent of the Shadow.</font>

12:05.782 --> 12:07.490
<font color="#ffff00">An enemy of the clan!</font>

12:07.542 --> 12:09.642
<font color="#ffff00">A needless provocation.</font>

12:10.859 --> 12:13.279
<font color="#ffff00">Now revenge is upon us.</font>

12:16.918 --> 12:19.031
<font color="#ffff00">The raid is over.</font>

12:19.684 --> 12:21.750
<font color="#ffff00">What's done is done!</font>

12:21.779 --> 12:26.800
<font color="#ffff00">But the Shadow pays well for the vessel.</font>

12:28.591 --> 12:30.950
<font color="#ffff00">We should join him.</font>

12:30.973 --> 12:32.793
<font color="#ffff00">For wealth and power!</font>

12:33.941 --> 12:36.822
<font color="#ffff00">We are warriors!
Hear my words!</font>

12:40.964 --> 12:43.854
<font color="#ffff00">You will end as his slaves!</font>

12:45.152 --> 12:51.192
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, we are warriors. Not
thieves and murderers!</font>

12:52.026 --> 12:56.273
<font color="#ffff00">Mulgrut wants you to bow to
the Shadow. I know his heart.</font>

12:57.702 --> 12:59.843
<font color="#ffff00">You are a weakling.</font>

12:59.916 --> 13:03.464
<font color="#ffff00">We don't fight for gold!</font>

13:03.525 --> 13:06.203
<font color="#ffff00">But for glory!</font>

13:17.104 --> 13:20.955
<font color="#ffff00">The horde has no respect for you, Kullimon</font>

13:22.249 --> 13:24.649
<font color="#ffff00">They are going to follow me!</font>

13:25.501 --> 13:29.333
<font color="#ffff00">The horde is mine now.</font>

13:30.734 --> 13:34.479
<font color="#ffff00">And mine alone!</font>

13:54.676 --> 13:58.596
<font color="#ffff00">Those who are still faithful,
may follow me.</font>

14:30.607 --> 14:32.302
<font color="#ffff00">Kill these cowards!</font>

14:50.568 --> 14:52.388
<font color="#ffff00">To me!
To me!</font>

15:26.524 --> 15:28.774
<font color="#ffff00">Seize him!</font>

15:39.173 --> 15:40.859
<font color="#ffff00">On your knees!</font>

15:46.262 --> 15:51.418
<font color="#ffff00">Are you brave enough to murder
the grandson of Mahan Shek?</font>

15:51.506 --> 15:54.160
<font color="#ffff00">descendant of the Holy Warrior?</font>

15:56.854 --> 15:59.722
<font color="#ffff00">This I will not do, Kullimon.</font>

16:00.857 --> 16:04.085
<font color="#ffff00">Since a quick death is too merciful for you.</font>

16:53.613 --> 16:57.520
What information did you take from the Dwarf?

16:57.898 --> 17:02.872
He spoke of a vessel, Prophetess!
To be delivered by Kullimon.

17:03.396 --> 17:07.638
An Orc raider.
We've crossed paths before.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.165
The Dwarf also spoke of the power of Goth Azul.

17:10.190 --> 17:14.298
The God of Death!
Do not speak his name.

17:14.318 --> 17:17.201
The other Gods are seeking
a return to our world

17:17.231 --> 17:19.242
as our Goddess feared.

17:19.262 --> 17:21.431
They must not succeed!

17:21.451 --> 17:25.933
Lest the world be ravaged by
chaos in a new war of Gods.

17:26.133 --> 17:29.538
If the Death God is unleashed
from the underworld

17:29.558 --> 17:34.995
all things living shall perish.
- Tell me where to go, prophetess.

17:35.015 --> 17:39.900
The general called Drennon has an agent
of the Shadow in his dungeon.

17:39.922 --> 17:43.961
Spare no method in extracting
answers from him.

17:43.981 --> 17:47.384
You must not fail this.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.998
A package for field general Drennon.
- Leave your weapons.

18:29.018 --> 18:33.080
Why?
- Leave your weapons or leave the outpost!

18:58.740 --> 19:02.344
This is his head, I take it?
- It is.

19:02.502 --> 19:04.859
He'll have to be identified.

19:05.448 --> 19:10.929
400 gold coins. That is what was promised.
Do not cheat me, Human!

19:11.524 --> 19:15.717
For the full 400 you'd have to take
the head to the fortress at Ang-Kirk.

19:15.957 --> 19:18.166
And that is a long road.

19:18.595 --> 19:22.054
One not friendly to Elven kind.

19:22.295 --> 19:26.494
I will give you 300 and my men will take the
head to the fortress for the difference.

19:26.514 --> 19:28.931
You are a ringed signatory of the Order.

19:28.951 --> 19:31.747
You will give me the 400
or I will take the head.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.782
And what?
You've killed him for us already.

19:34.802 --> 19:40.660
That's well enough and I doubt you'll find
any other interested buyers for a bandit's head.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.396
Bandit?
That's another thing.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.603
The bounty was for Fang-Tor
Bloodmoon, the bandit.

19:46.682 --> 19:49.919
Nobody said anything about a
dragon riding Shaman.

19:50.037 --> 19:52.792
He gave me this as a parting gift.

19:54.930 --> 19:58.986
I think I'm owed something a
little extra, don't you think?

20:01.733 --> 20:04.944
Alas, for you an outcome

20:04.964 --> 20:09.581
both unfortunate and regrettable.

20:09.893 --> 20:13.664
The symbol itself is outlawed.
You must understand.

20:13.703 --> 20:18.977
Get me a cleric who can get rid of this thing
before I forget what side I'm fighting for!

20:19.101 --> 20:23.931
The mark as far as we've been able to discover
is permanent and cannot be removed.

20:23.951 --> 20:27.493
Even with magic.
- Well, I have a problem with that.

20:27.513 --> 20:30.522
As do I.
Seize her!

20:30.769 --> 20:32.773
What?!

20:34.020 --> 20:38.635
You bear the mark. An agent
of the Shadow cannot be trusted.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.347
Your reward is forfeit.

21:20.151 --> 21:23.349
I should slit you, traitor.
- Assaulting a magistrate

21:23.369 --> 21:27.608
is punishable by death.
- Mine or yours?

21:30.897 --> 21:33.591
Don't ever let a blade
through that door again.

21:34.098 --> 21:36.900
Strip her down to her skin next time.

21:43.403 --> 21:48.413
Oh god! Keltus, what do you want?

21:48.423 --> 21:51.664
I have enough troubles with
bounty hunters and cultists.

21:51.684 --> 21:54.894
I don't need the church as well,
meddling with my business.

21:56.261 --> 22:01.550
I'll be damned! Have some decency!
- Hail, magistrate.

22:05.012 --> 22:09.487
Hail, Ambassador!
What is this about?

22:09.973 --> 22:12.845
The Dwarves are joining
up with the Shadow now.

22:13.293 --> 22:16.513
Elves too, from what
I've seen this morning.

22:16.634 --> 22:19.553
That one claims she was cursed.

22:19.665 --> 22:22.589
Did you have to drop his
bloody arm on my table?

22:22.609 --> 22:25.035
You should have brought
this Dwarf to me for a trial.

22:25.055 --> 22:28.284
Don't question my methods
and I won't report yours.

22:28.746 --> 22:33.934
Are the hands of the Prophetess so clean
that you follow her without question?

22:34.035 --> 22:37.150
My orders come directly from the Lady herself.

22:37.170 --> 22:40.478
I have nothing to doubt
and I answer to no one.

22:42.008 --> 22:47.155
You are young still.
With few regrets.

22:47.196 --> 22:52.936
You have a prisoner named Maggut Guilbrow.
I need to ask him a few questions.

23:20.905 --> 23:25.575
Beautiful flower, trapped in an ugly place.

23:25.962 --> 23:29.310
So sweet to my lips and tongue.

23:42.674 --> 23:47.888
Sister, you bear the mark.

23:49.325 --> 23:51.492
And an elf, no less!

23:52.577 --> 23:55.209
How precious!

23:56.420 --> 23:58.240
Listen carefully!

23:58.522 --> 24:02.502
There is a box,
heavy, laden with gold.

24:02.517 --> 24:06.579
Which gold must be
taken to Garret's Crossing

24:06.599 --> 24:09.829
by the second watch of the new moon.

24:10.746 --> 24:13.462
If by some chance you are...

24:15.905 --> 24:21.157
You must take our place and exchange
the gold with Kullimon's raiders

24:21.177 --> 24:27.150
for the sacred vessel which the
Shadow sought these many years.

24:28.206 --> 24:33.047
Where is the gold?
- In the hollow of a tree.

24:33.462 --> 24:36.534
Just after the Bleeding
Stone you will find it.

24:36.554 --> 24:41.175
At dawn collect the blood from the altar

24:41.195 --> 24:45.645
to fill the vessel.
- Where is the Bleeding Stone?

24:47.536 --> 24:53.433
You bear the mark.
Sure you know that.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.379
Where is the Bleeding Stone?

24:58.844 --> 25:01.328
You impostor!

25:47.875 --> 25:50.720
I see you saved Drennon the trouble of an execution.
.

25:54.940 --> 25:59.267
You bear the mark, yet you murder
your own Shadow brother.

26:01.746 --> 26:04.130
Did he speak before you killed him?

26:08.377 --> 26:11.935
I know you are cursed with the mark

26:12.071 --> 26:14.969
by the Orc Shaman,
who calls himself Fang-Tor.

26:14.989 --> 26:18.083
Right before I cut off his head.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.644
Release her to me!
By authority of the Prophetess.

26:24.864 --> 26:30.147
Tell no one Maggut Guilbrow is dead.
Burn the body.

26:49.628 --> 26:53.711
Death, death is upon you,
wandering warrior.

26:53.731 --> 26:55.496
Step aside!

26:55.716 --> 27:01.700
The stain of spilled blood
leaves a mark, does it not?

27:04.487 --> 27:07.670
I speak of you, Keltus.

27:09.354 --> 27:11.530
How do you know me?

27:14.870 --> 27:17.546
I have seen you before,
near the temple.

27:17.708 --> 27:20.079
You've come a long
way to play at riddles.

27:20.298 --> 27:25.575
Riddles?
I meant to speak plainly.

27:26.064 --> 27:29.437
A hero is known by his deeds

27:29.564 --> 27:32.617
but judged by his heart.

27:32.969 --> 27:37.927
Who has your heart,
Keltus, wanderer?

27:41.692 --> 27:43.579
Friend of yours?

27:43.889 --> 27:47.664
Come on,
there's a long way ahead of us.

28:26.153 --> 28:31.039
You know I can help but I'm
gonna need your help first.

28:50.820 --> 28:53.374
I don't need your help, Human!
- Really?

28:53.518 --> 28:55.733
I freed you from execution.

29:14.601 --> 29:19.360
I work alone and my work is
far from finished. I go South.

29:21.239 --> 29:24.225
You know, the priestesses of the
Order can remove the mark.

29:24.251 --> 29:27.134
It's your choice.
Maybe you'd rather see yourself decay

29:27.197 --> 29:30.267
as the undead contagion festers in your blood.

29:30.296 --> 29:34.189
Which it does as we speak.
- What priestesses?

29:34.322 --> 29:36.587
Where are they?
- I serve my mistress

29:36.632 --> 29:39.255
the Prophetess of Ari-Alia,
I am their ambassador.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.856
What do you want with me, Ambassador?
- You have the mark!

29:44.283 --> 29:48.135
But unwillingly. That makes
you special, maybe even unique.

29:48.279 --> 29:51.531
I need you to infiltrate the Shadow
and bring me information.

29:52.284 --> 29:54.525
And you'll see to it that
I'm cured of this?

29:55.199 --> 29:57.249
Yes.

29:58.299 --> 30:01.796
Cure me first and then I'll help you.
- The priestesses are days from here.

30:01.886 --> 30:03.736
I need your help now.

30:09.783 --> 30:11.697
The rat-faced human
that I killed in the prison

30:11.747 --> 30:13.958
told me to go to the Bleeding Stone.

30:14.249 --> 30:18.301
The Bleeding Stone?
What did he want you to do there?

30:18.739 --> 30:20.865
I'll tell you when we get there.

30:22.716 --> 30:25.090
That's more than a day on foot.

30:35.992 --> 30:40.161
You said you work alone.
Unusual for an Elf.

30:40.676 --> 30:44.115
Where are your kin?
- I have no kin.

30:44.623 --> 30:47.947
Your fighting style is Elahrian.
- Yes.

30:48.104 --> 30:53.407
A High Elf then. From the Garuun-Dan.
- Yes

30:54.205 --> 30:56.845
But surely too young to have fought in the Orc wars?

30:57.460 --> 30:59.347
You are a survivor.

31:00.406 --> 31:03.668
You know, I read the history,
the whole clans were starving.

31:03.788 --> 31:08.662
Forced them to your forests. There was a famine.
- Bite your tongue, Orc lover.

31:09.460 --> 31:14.155
Hey, I am no fan of the Orcs.
But I am no fan of Elves either.

31:14.273 --> 31:18.433
You and I have no friends,
we share that at least.

31:21.693 --> 31:24.459
The Bleeding Stone is on that far ridge.

31:51.206 --> 31:53.202
What?

32:19.622 --> 32:25.554
Well met, brother of the Order.
- Not so well for you, it seems, Kullimon the Black.

32:28.121 --> 32:30.896
You're the one they call 'Wanderer'.

32:31.446 --> 32:34.820
You're younger than your reputation implies.

32:35.331 --> 32:39.078
Was it not so long ago you were a
commander of a horde of Orc raiders?

32:39.875 --> 32:44.871
I may have the lost the battle
but not yet my last breath.

32:50.085 --> 32:52.911
What's this? Your consort?

32:53.110 --> 32:57.575
Surely  your prophetess frowns
upon her henchman befriending an elf.

32:58.398 --> 33:00.146
Enough.

33:00.277 --> 33:04.113
Now, you have the habit of killing prisoners before
I have a chance to question them.

33:07.578 --> 33:11.851
What news from Warspire?
- Hard times, Human.

33:11.875 --> 33:14.359
Good raid targets are
not easy to come by.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.747
Rumor has it the monastery
was sacked just two days before.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.711
Leaving many dead.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.230
Sounds like a certain someone I know.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.353
Cut me down and I'll tell you about it.

33:25.411 --> 33:28.135
It was the shrine of Noc Benari.
They are monastics.

33:28.136 --> 33:31.114
They have taken a vow of poverty.
They have nothing of value there.

33:31.883 --> 33:35.521
Nothing of value to me or to you,
but beneath the shrine

33:35.701 --> 33:39.357
is the tomb of Odus the Tall
and in that tomb were some artifacts.

33:39.435 --> 33:43.629
One of which was very eagerly sought
after by an agent of the Shadow.

33:43.841 --> 33:46.000
Which artifact?

33:47.470 --> 33:49.816
Cut me down.

33:57.111 --> 33:59.315
Which artifact, Kullimon?

33:59.388 --> 34:03.547
The Bone Vessel is what they call it
- The Bone Vessel?

34:03.865 --> 34:08.420
It's said it holds the Ashes of Amun Khan.
It's a fake, like most relics.

34:08.658 --> 34:12.639
Fake or not, delivered into the right hands
it's worth a small fortune in gold.

34:12.906 --> 34:17.529
Where will the exchange take place?
- I will take you there.

34:18.050 --> 34:21.771
With your wounds you are too slow.
Go back to Warspire. This is my affair now.

34:22.042 --> 34:27.174
I too have unfinished deeds.
I go to face the horde one last time.

34:28.853 --> 34:31.788
Kill me if you must.
I will not tell you the place.

34:32.264 --> 34:37.554
Go on, kill him. It is at Garret's
Crossing at new moon.

34:39.513 --> 34:43.302
The girl speaks truth, but there
are details of which she is unaware.

34:44.201 --> 34:47.614
If it's the vessel you want,
you'd be fools to refuse my help.

34:47.882 --> 34:51.183
I care nothing for this so called Bone Vessel.

34:53.148 --> 34:56.764
I would rather saw my left arm off
and be done with the both of you

34:56.784 --> 34:59.463
than work with this pig faced scum

34:59.606 --> 35:04.316
Your curse! Your days
are numbered, Shadow child.

35:04.411 --> 35:06.887
It is I who shall refuse to accompany you!

35:07.009 --> 35:09.779
She is not controlled by the Shadow of Death.

35:09.957 --> 35:13.578
Yet she would kill an unarmed,
wounded, kneeling opponent.

35:16.746 --> 35:20.582
The goddess sent me to each
of you, all for a noble purpose.

35:24.643 --> 35:28.191
It is no coincidence we will
go together to meet our fate.

35:31.431 --> 35:33.212
Had enough?

35:36.485 --> 35:38.968
There may be a time and place
for you to kill each other

35:39.019 --> 35:42.221
but it is not here and not now.

35:44.588 --> 35:49.122
I do not serve your Goddess and I
do not live or die by goodwill.

35:50.222 --> 35:53.058
So long as her goals and my own are aligned

35:53.189 --> 35:55.384
I will go with you.

35:55.649 --> 35:58.944
I care nothing for the gods. I do as I please.

35:59.050 --> 36:02.299
But I will travel with you two fools to 
the Bleeding Stone and no further.

36:03.017 --> 36:07.428
That's for my part. Keltus will see to it
that his priestesses remove my mark.

36:07.782 --> 36:10.820
And if I again choose to end
the life of a worthless Orc

36:10.886 --> 36:13.787
do not get in my way or it
will be yours that I take.
.

36:16.377 --> 36:21.533
To the Bleeding Stone then. We'll march
through the night if Kullimon can handle it.

36:21.650 --> 36:25.453
Even dripping in blood
I out walk you, pale-skin.

36:45.364 --> 36:49.445
There's movement out there.
I can sense it.

36:49.476 --> 36:52.705
Yet I see no warmth
and hear no beating heart.

36:53.414 --> 36:56.125
Not all that walks has a beating heart.

37:57.034 --> 37:59.256
A weapon.

38:16.817 --> 38:19.488
Thanks for your help.
- It was a puny lizard.

38:19.633 --> 38:22.713
No match for Keltus the Wanderer.

38:46.955 --> 38:50.088
The Bleeding Stone,
was a meeting place for the Warlocks.

38:50.808 --> 38:54.104
Ancient worshipers of an Elder God.

38:54.169 --> 38:57.041
Nemyt, what was it Maggut wanted you here for?

39:01.818 --> 39:05.286
He told me to wait for the Moon Zyneth
and then to collect the blood from the stone.

39:05.966 --> 39:08.684
This is not something my raiders care about.

39:08.892 --> 39:11.543
It was not needed for the exchange.

39:11.887 --> 39:14.742
Only the Shadow wants this blood.

39:14.902 --> 39:17.051
We should leave it be.

39:18.751 --> 39:22.210
The Horde was to be paid in gold.
- How much?

39:22.296 --> 39:26.598
A thousand coins worth.
- Which we don't have.

39:26.604 --> 39:32.341
Nemyt, it's time to tell us everything
Maggut Guilbrow said to you in that prison.

39:35.568 --> 39:38.938
He became suspicious of me when
I asked where the Bleeding Stone was.

39:38.996 --> 39:43.600
He couldn't tell me anything
more so I killed him.

39:44.375 --> 39:47.070
You should have left him for me to question.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.497
We wait here and see if the Bleeding Stone
lives up to its name, then collect the Blood.

39:52.743 --> 39:55.854
We may need Nemyt to pose as
a true Shadow agent before long

39:55.921 --> 39:58.063
and the blood may
make all the difference.

39:58.424 --> 40:00.533
In the meantime get some sleep.

40:02.493 --> 40:05.758
We won't stop again before we reach Garret's Crossing.

42:45.309 --> 42:50.203
Where is the brat?
- She left in the woods only moments ago.

43:04.277 --> 43:07.692
Looks like she knew just when to leave.

43:10.034 --> 43:12.145
Which way out of here?

43:12.679 --> 43:15.523
If we can cut them down
I guess we can outrun them.

43:15.746 --> 43:18.975
Cowards run, warriors fight.

43:20.299 --> 43:21.884
Then we fight.

43:38.950 --> 43:42.130
Too many of them!
Killing gets us nowhere!

43:43.423 --> 43:46.055
<i>Killing is all I can offer.</i>

43:48.561 --> 43:50.924
Let's not be too nice.

43:51.214 --> 43:53.778
Attention!

46:02.093 --> 46:04.575
From which hell did they come from?

46:05.311 --> 46:09.796
They were watching all along.
When you left they closed in.

46:09.869 --> 46:13.097
Why?
- You're one of them. That's why.

46:13.185 --> 46:16.003
Where were you?
- I couldn't sleep.

46:21.647 --> 46:24.568
I just saved you!
What do you want from me?

46:25.001 --> 46:28.003
Do you think I'm evil?
You think I'm one of them?

46:28.203 --> 46:30.467
I want you to tell me the truth.

46:30.511 --> 46:33.898
The truth?
You swore to help me!

46:34.082 --> 46:37.715
To rid me of this curse.
You tell me the truth, Keltus!

46:37.774 --> 46:42.422
Am I just a pawn in this game?
Can your almighty Prophetess help me?

46:42.541 --> 46:44.538
Can she?!

46:46.539 --> 46:47.659
Yes.

46:48.796 --> 46:54.142
And if she can't, then what?
- She will save you.

46:58.365 --> 47:02.128
This, this isn't me.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.420
They did this to me and
I'm gonna make them pay.

47:08.729 --> 47:12.406
And I believe you can, Nemyt.
If you can resist long enough!

47:25.606 --> 47:28.906
Enough! We must leave!

47:29.837 --> 47:35.382
To Garret's Crossing. Now!
Before the next night falls.

48:40.913 --> 48:44.767
Human flesh is weak.
My wounds from that damn cross

48:44.850 --> 48:50.154
are just old scars.
- The flesh is weak, but the mind is sharp.

48:50.601 --> 48:55.119
The mind too is weak.
You have feelings for the Elf brat.

48:55.579 --> 48:58.832
She is fighting the curse.
Even you must admire her strength.

48:58.875 --> 49:02.727
Her heart is black or the curse
would not have taken to her.

49:02.747 --> 49:07.177
The Shadow has claim only on souls
blinded by murder and hatred.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.200
She was cursed as she killed
Fang-Tor Bloodmoon.

49:10.469 --> 49:12.724
The Shaman lord?

49:14.176 --> 49:19.748
I suspected she was in league with the Shadow.
It was he who poisoned Mulgrut's mind.

49:20.905 --> 49:23.093
I owe her debt for killing him.

49:23.179 --> 49:25.814
And now she's cursed because of it.

49:27.016 --> 49:32.383
And there's one other thing.
She was a child of the Garuun-Dan.

49:32.575 --> 49:36.942
I should have known.
- She is consumed with vengeance.

49:40.249 --> 49:45.728
The skies were free of rain these years.
The clans were starving.

49:46.173 --> 49:51.510
We went to the woods many times, to survive.
We wanted food, nothing more.

49:51.808 --> 49:54.859
The Elves were hidden in the trees.

49:54.879 --> 49:58.975
We didn't even see them as our hunters
were slain by Elven arrows.

50:00.835 --> 50:05.758
Every party returned with diminished numbers.
Without food.

50:06.082 --> 50:08.378
At last we gathered a war party.

50:08.391 --> 50:11.611
And in desperation attacked the Garuun-Dan.

50:13.280 --> 50:16.400
Their women fought as valiantly as the men.

50:16.669 --> 50:19.228
And we spared the children.

50:21.465 --> 50:26.491
She has nothing but her revenge.
No family, no people.

50:27.089 --> 50:29.549
She kills without remorse.

50:29.652 --> 50:35.528
Is she so different from you, wanderer?
Your order is not known for its kindness.

50:35.604 --> 50:37.971
In service of a higher purpose.

50:38.744 --> 50:43.307
The prophetess remains pure but her servants...
they do as they must.

51:10.047 --> 51:13.256
No one's here. We're early.

51:13.742 --> 51:17.481
Why do we assume the Shadow hasn't
already sent an agent for the exchange?

51:17.760 --> 51:20.423
As long as we are here first
it won't matter.

51:20.564 --> 51:22.729
Keep watch!

51:33.887 --> 51:36.120
I gotta take care of this.

52:05.681 --> 52:07.665
The elf retrieved the bones.

52:07.934 --> 52:11.038
And I will return them to
the temple for destruction.

52:11.690 --> 52:14.970
And you trust her for this task?

52:15.356 --> 52:17.560
I see no other option.

52:18.471 --> 52:21.562
I promised her the priestesses
would cure her of the contagion

52:21.565 --> 52:25.038
and remove the mark.
- She is an Elven murderer.

52:25.097 --> 52:29.337
And soon will be the servant of Goth Azul.

52:29.432 --> 52:34.558
Her usefulness is at an end.
You will kill her.

52:36.290 --> 52:38.610
I had planned to do so.

52:38.659 --> 52:42.466
You are my loyal servant, Keltus.

53:03.176 --> 53:08.105
None to soon. Here comes Mulgrut
my former first captain.

53:10.043 --> 53:15.334
Good, they are early.
Nemyt, you ready?

53:15.458 --> 53:18.889
As ready as I can be to face a horde of dogs.

53:21.751 --> 53:25.786
Hold nothing back. Mulgrut
has a keen eye for treasure.

53:26.032 --> 53:30.419
And if something should go wrong?
- We're on our way.

53:30.528 --> 53:34.277
You make for a small target.
- Thanks.

53:34.384 --> 53:39.407
Beware of Mulgrut. He has a coward's
heart but a cunning mind.

53:39.663 --> 53:43.515
If they can fear you
you will succeed.

54:15.170 --> 54:21.092
<i>Burning field. Broken spire.</i>

54:21.279 --> 54:26.808
<i>The coward soils his pants
as I light him on fire.</i>

54:32.426 --> 54:35.554
The common tongue doesn't do justice.

54:55.249 --> 54:58.994
Does the Shadow send in a child

54:59.092 --> 55:02.316
to do with Mulgrut, the Warlord?

55:02.356 --> 55:03.921
And where is Kullimon the Black?

55:03.922 --> 55:07.338
Does he send his whores
to deal with the Shadow?

55:08.841 --> 55:14.800
Kullimon the Black is now
Kullimon the worm food.

55:31.841 --> 55:35.838
You are a kneel fight,
barely initiated to the Shadow.

55:35.858 --> 55:38.763
How is it you have gone to the ...
- I have come for the vessel.

55:39.016 --> 55:41.669
I have the payment in full.

55:51.349 --> 55:55.306
This purse is light.

55:55.835 --> 55:58.484
Do not think to make a fool of me, Elf!

55:58.871 --> 56:03.218
The Shadow cares nothing for money,
we wouldn't cheat you over a few paltry coins.

56:03.333 --> 56:06.430
One thousand as agreed.

56:06.431 --> 56:12.410
Why should I not keep your
treasure along with the vessel?

56:15.435 --> 56:18.684
Are you fool enough to trifle with the Shadow?

56:18.748 --> 56:22.091
My life means nothing and now
yours hangs by a thread.

56:22.204 --> 56:24.591
Give me the vessel!

56:26.890 --> 56:30.624
Kethku, give her the vessel!
Now!

56:35.556 --> 56:41.134
Another day, Orc scum and I would
bleed you like the filthy pig you are.

56:50.637 --> 56:52.356
Seize her!

57:03.830 --> 57:07.647
Tell me, dark rider
does this Elf ride with you?

57:07.667 --> 57:10.995
A thief and impostor!
Give me the vessel!

57:11.046 --> 57:15.577
No, not so fast.
She has paid the price.

57:15.678 --> 57:17.412
How do I know...

57:22.144 --> 57:26.111
You dare to mock?
Give me the vessel!

57:28.145 --> 57:31.269
Kethku!

57:40.680 --> 57:43.698
You lust for power,
Mulgrut the Betrayer!

57:43.819 --> 57:46.359
And power you shall be granted!

57:46.928 --> 57:51.804
Banded murderers and betrayers,
join with the rising Shadow

57:51.824 --> 57:57.210
and take upon you the Power of Goth Azul.

57:57.230 --> 58:00.805
Bothku Vir Otumnai Ger-Havock..

58:17.376 --> 58:19.668
Ha, i'm immune.

58:32.483 --> 58:34.748
At last!

58:35.935 --> 58:40.935
I am immortal.
We serve Goth Azul!

58:42.284 --> 58:45.312
Go to the Dimwood Pass.

58:53.759 --> 58:55.975
And now you, plaything!

58:56.089 --> 59:00.401
We'll make great swat.
For the horde.

59:00.531 --> 59:04.248
Take her to Dimwood Pass.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.679
I'll go after the Shadow agent.

59:17.113 --> 59:21.430
I must retrieve the vessel.
- And I have a vendetta to settle with the horde.

59:22.113 --> 59:26.799
You would leave the girl to her terrible
fate after she did her part to help you?

59:27.430 --> 59:30.491
My only responsibility
is to the Prophetess.

59:32.897 --> 59:36.162
May your enemies suffer and your friends...

59:37.746 --> 59:40.355
May your enemies suffer.

01:00:17.742 --> 01:00:20.228
Prophetess, guide me.

01:01:55.257 --> 01:01:58.710
After Mulgrut has
had his fun with you

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:02.251
he's promised you to me.

01:02:19.516 --> 01:02:21.920
I've bled the Bleeding Stone
if that's what you were looking for

01:02:21.986 --> 01:02:26.729
Ambassador of Light,
you will give in to the Shadow.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:31.064
Your soul is empty.
- You stole the ashes of Amun Khan.

01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:34.797
I'm taking them back!
- You cannot kill me.

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:38.592
You belong to Goth Azul now!

01:04:24.487 --> 01:04:28.931
Your faith is weak, your mind is doubtful.

01:04:29.022 --> 01:04:34.030
In death you will serve our master well.

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:39.499
I will never serve Goth Azul.

01:04:58.116 --> 01:04:59.556
Prophetess

01:05:01.188 --> 01:05:02.180
Save me!

01:05:02.212 --> 01:05:05.871
You have failed me, Keltus the Forsaken.

01:05:05.965 --> 01:05:11.625
You are forever cursed.
The goddess remembers you no more.

01:06:35.717 --> 01:06:38.384
I don't lay with fish.

01:07:06.712 --> 01:07:10.410
Play with us.
- Yes, come play with us.

01:07:12.345 --> 01:07:15.278
Come, play with us.

01:07:23.299 --> 01:07:28.162
Are you not Kullimon the Brave?
Kullimon the Conqueror?

01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:32.415
I don't have time for
this, water whore.

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:15.404
There is still fight in you, that is good.

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:18.401
It means more fun for me!
- Don't touch me.

01:09:18.569 --> 01:09:24.261
But I am Mulgrut!
Warlord Of the Battle Grave!

01:09:24.345 --> 01:09:26.578
And Slayer of Elves.

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.649
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:09:37.947 --> 01:09:43.095
Mulgrut, the horde is hungry.
They have not hunted in days.

01:09:43.126 --> 01:09:45.243
The hunger will pass.

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:51.018
The warriors, they are restless.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:53.868
They ask why we must wait here.

01:09:53.888 --> 01:09:58.332
They do not serve the Shadow.

01:10:00.514 --> 01:10:05.742
The horde serves at my pleasure
and my pleasure is here, in Dimwood Pass!

01:10:05.845 --> 01:10:10.110
Now go and muster my horde.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.378
For the bloodsport.

01:10:14.806 --> 01:10:16.920
Horde, Pak-Chut!

01:10:24.615 --> 01:10:30.493
And now, my plaything...
I will teach you of much suffering!

01:10:31.429 --> 01:10:34.891
The Horde kills for honor
in battle, Mulgrut.

01:10:35.912 --> 01:10:39.389
Is one bound girl
the best you can do?

01:10:45.084 --> 01:10:49.552
No! Kullimon!
It is impossible!

01:10:49.832 --> 01:10:53.172
How fares the Horde under
Mulgrut the Betrayer, Kethku?

01:10:53.173 --> 01:10:56.601
Have you spent that gold?
Have you hunted?

01:10:56.945 --> 01:10:59.288
Have you seen victory in battle?

01:11:00.335 --> 01:11:02.976
Or instead have you been cursed and enslaved

01:11:03.095 --> 01:11:05.733
taking orders from a human master?

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:08.631
Silence him!

01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:13.394
I challenge Mulgrut for the Horde.

01:11:13.905 --> 01:11:15.206
No.

01:11:15.457 --> 01:11:18.657
You have no right to challenge.

01:11:18.872 --> 01:11:22.241
The Horde has already chosen between us!

01:11:26.295 --> 01:11:30.528
Do you fear to bite me,
Mulgrut the Cursed?

01:12:15.942 --> 01:12:21.072
I, Kullimon the Black,
again Master of the Horde.

01:12:24.433 --> 01:12:27.136
But this Horde is cursed.

01:12:27.314 --> 01:12:30.095
A curse which I alone have escaped!

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:33.458
You all belong to the Shadow now!

01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:36.235
And my revenge is complete.

01:12:46.634 --> 01:12:49.841
Kullimon is not one of us!

01:12:50.819 --> 01:12:55.205
Shadow warriors, immortal brothers,

01:12:55.299 --> 01:12:59.831
It is I, Mulgrut,
who has power over death.

01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:02.408
It's us!

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.369
What are you doing?

01:14:06.856 --> 01:14:08.932
Now we can go.

01:14:12.103 --> 01:14:14.451
Kill them.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.297
Move!

01:16:04.568 --> 01:16:08.661
And here you are again, Keltus, Wanderer.

01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:11.271
Though you're alone.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.201
So very alone.

01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:34.474
I've been watching you, Keltus,
judging you.

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:38.323
Your sword is keen.

01:16:38.573 --> 01:16:42.651
Your devotion is absolute,
but your heart is empty.

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:46.904
You can not defeat Goth Azul like that.

01:16:47.996 --> 01:16:49.396
Who are you?

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:58.011
I am your oldest friend, Keltus.

01:16:58.273 --> 01:17:00.938
Your only friend.

01:17:01.843 --> 01:17:05.971
You have been cast off so I claim you as my own.

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:08.392
The Shadow rules over the dead

01:17:08.412 --> 01:17:12.524
but has no real power over the living.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:08.124
You still feel pain.
That's a good sign.

01:18:14.363 --> 01:18:16.704
There. Good as new.

01:18:18.804 --> 01:18:22.507
An old Orc healing trick!
It seals the wound shut.

01:18:22.593 --> 01:18:25.030
Stops the bleeding.

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:35.643
You touched me.

01:18:37.022 --> 01:18:39.197
Never do that again.

01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:45.042
I make no promises.
But I respect your request.

01:18:48.734 --> 01:18:50.371
Where is Keltus?

01:18:52.474 --> 01:18:55.334
He went after the Shadow agent.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:06.177
You're surprisingly resistant to the curse.

01:19:06.665 --> 01:19:11.705
My kindred, they succumbed very quickly.

01:19:13.153 --> 01:19:16.311
That is because they are weak willed pigs.

01:19:17.676 --> 01:19:20.666
As are all Orcs?

01:19:23.684 --> 01:19:25.513
Not all of them.

01:19:28.219 --> 01:19:30.310
So what will you do now?

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:37.695
What I've always done. I'm gonna
punish those who have wronged me.

01:19:38.253 --> 01:19:40.961
Keltus?
- No.

01:19:42.822 --> 01:19:46.630
He is what he is,
I always understood that.

01:19:47.014 --> 01:19:48.947
The Shadow then?

01:19:50.213 --> 01:19:52.590
They cursed the wrong Elf.

01:19:54.295 --> 01:19:58.645
And they are gonna regret it.
- You should rest, regain your strength.

01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:01.627
I'm strong enough.

01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:06.266
I work alone.
- Alone you will fail.

01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:09.417
Keltus was right.
I was meant to help you.

01:20:12.438 --> 01:20:14.586
Thanks for saving me.

01:20:33.653 --> 01:20:35.448
We must continue.

01:20:55.892 --> 01:20:57.012
Down!

01:20:59.835 --> 01:21:03.386
This is my domain.

01:21:05.764 --> 01:21:07.119
What is this magic?

01:21:07.225 --> 01:21:11.047
It's not magic.
It's a machine, it's a powder.

01:21:11.087 --> 01:21:13.447
Dwarven devilry!

01:21:19.354 --> 01:21:22.511
I'm gonna break your scrawny neck, coward.

01:21:28.566 --> 01:21:31.263
I will collect your heads.

01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:34.621
Orc and Elf kind!

01:21:40.918 --> 01:21:43.388
Come, catch me!

01:21:59.544 --> 01:22:01.606
Now! He's reloading.

01:22:34.789 --> 01:22:37.054
She is one of us.

01:22:38.087 --> 01:22:40.524
But you are an outsider.

01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:45.959
All hail the God of Death.

01:22:47.575 --> 01:22:49.958
I bring the thunder!

01:22:50.457 --> 01:22:52.606
And I bring the rain.

01:23:04.984 --> 01:23:07.219
A little sooner would have been nice.

01:23:07.402 --> 01:23:10.318
I just saved you from a one-armed Dwarf.

01:23:13.584 --> 01:23:16.491
I hate to have to kill everything twice.

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:44.374
Keltus?

01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:49.065
You still resist the curse.
I was wrong about you.

01:23:49.092 --> 01:23:53.132
There is so much strength in you
and good left in your heart.

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.911
You came back.

01:23:58.413 --> 01:24:00.802
We have to kill them.
- I know.

01:24:01.897 --> 01:24:04.007
I lied to you, Nemyt.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.287
The Prophetess would
never have removed the mark.

01:24:06.303 --> 01:24:10.370
You did your part and
you nearly died. I'm sorry.

01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:14.184
I do not know how to save you
or even if you can be saved.

01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:18.109
Then I will resist it for as long as I can.

01:24:19.486 --> 01:24:21.382
So what now?

01:24:25.792 --> 01:24:28.392
The Shadow agent has
the ashes of Amun Khan.

01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:31.220
And the blood of Goth Azul.
He took the canteen

01:24:31.244 --> 01:24:33.283
I collected at the Bleeding Stone.

01:24:33.357 --> 01:24:36.468
When they are mixed together
at the entrance to the underworld

01:24:36.541 --> 01:24:40.134
they will raise an Avatar of Goth Azul,
Lord of the Dead.

01:24:40.199 --> 01:24:43.652
With him at their head, their
legions will march across the land,

01:24:43.671 --> 01:24:46.870
their ranks swelling with the
corpses they reanimate.

01:24:47.726 --> 01:24:50.527
And then they will be unstoppable.

01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:54.050
That sounds bad.

01:24:54.903 --> 01:24:56.910
They wait at the Well of Demons.

01:24:57.296 --> 01:25:00.492
Their leader Goth Azul was
imprisoned in the underworld.

01:25:00.661 --> 01:25:03.420
So where is this Well of Demons?

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.480
Nemyt was drawn to them,
she is leading us right to it.

01:25:10.329 --> 01:25:14.883
If anyone had told me I'd be joined
with an Elf and a Human Cleric

01:25:15.662 --> 01:25:18.012
I'd have cut off his manhood
and fed it to him.

01:25:18.484 --> 01:25:19.645
Yeah.

01:25:19.704 --> 01:25:22.512
Good thing I like you two.

01:25:43.866 --> 01:25:45.715
What's happened to you?

01:25:46.455 --> 01:25:48.344
You're different.

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:52.434
I've left the Order.

01:25:52.955 --> 01:25:56.678
And I follow Tarsa,
an Elder God.

01:26:00.538 --> 01:26:05.436
It's okay. I was healed.
There is hope for you yet.

01:26:06.115 --> 01:26:08.533
Let's get this done.

01:27:10.463 --> 01:27:12.631
What are they waiting for?

01:27:14.259 --> 01:27:16.762
Lots of innocent people down there.

01:27:16.927 --> 01:27:19.007
And the death offering is
enough to please him.

01:27:19.379 --> 01:27:23.380
Goth Azul will speak
and the ritual will begin.

01:27:23.647 --> 01:27:29.076
Shadow brothers! Prepare to
witness the rebirth of your god.

01:27:31.737 --> 01:27:34.522
Now is the time!

01:27:35.427 --> 01:27:38.070
Start the ritual!

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.483
Are you alright, Nemyt?

01:27:48.632 --> 01:27:50.561
I am drawn to the Well of Demons.

01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:53.600
But I can resist.

01:28:05.746 --> 01:28:08.174
They would sense Kullimon
or me among them.

01:28:10.315 --> 01:28:13.378
They will accept you.
You can get close enough.

01:28:14.346 --> 01:28:17.362
Close enough for what?
- Disrupt the ceremony.

01:28:17.567 --> 01:28:19.956
Get the Bone Vessel or the blood.

01:28:20.078 --> 01:28:23.875
Kullimon and I will provide distraction
to enable you to approach.

01:28:23.895 --> 01:28:25.844
Let's say she gets close enough

01:28:25.902 --> 01:28:27.964
and even gets the vessel.
What then?

01:28:28.148 --> 01:28:31.119
She wouldn't make it
out of there alive.

01:28:31.481 --> 01:28:36.808
No, but I can break the Bone Vessel,
throw its ashes to the wind.

01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:40.786
But they tear her to pieces.
There must be a better plan.

01:28:40.885 --> 01:28:45.496
This was always the plan.
It's why Keltus broke me out of prison.

01:28:51.929 --> 01:28:55.342
I will do it, but swear to me:

01:28:55.424 --> 01:28:58.878
If this curse overtakes me you will hunt
this body down and you will destroy it.

01:28:58.945 --> 01:29:02.812
Burn it until there's nothing left.
- I swear.

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:05.823
I believe in you, Nemyt.

01:29:10.385 --> 01:29:12.923
To die in battle
is the greatest glory.

01:29:12.984 --> 01:29:16.299
To chose to do so,
is the greatest honor.

01:29:17.617 --> 01:29:22.259
Who knows? Maybe even an Elf
can journey to the Hall Of Warriors.

01:29:29.772 --> 01:29:32.701
My vengeance on your kind
is satisfied, Kullimon.

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.038
You have killed enough Orcs?
- No.

01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:38.896
There's one I'm glad I didn't kill.

01:29:41.411 --> 01:29:43.341
Hurry!

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.239
Nemyt.

01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:50.788
Throw them in.

01:30:03.245 --> 01:30:05.636
No, no...

01:30:28.529 --> 01:30:32.502
I sense something.
She's not gonna make it.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:14.132
She stopped. The curse
was too much for her.

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:17.590
We will do our part.
Have faith she'll do hers.

01:31:17.877 --> 01:31:20.119
Come on.

01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:02.809
Kill the intruders!

01:32:07.353 --> 01:32:10.438
They took the bait.
You ready to die?

01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:13.810
I tried that once before.
Didn't suit me.

01:32:22.151 --> 01:32:26.611
Your heart is black,
your soul is dead.

01:32:26.667 --> 01:32:30.449
Now fall on your sword.

01:32:43.773 --> 01:32:46.653
Fall on your sword.

01:32:46.829 --> 01:32:50.687
You will obey.
- No.

01:33:39.594 --> 01:33:45.270
It is time, nothing can stop us now.

01:33:48.426 --> 01:33:51.185
Kullimon! Nemyt!

01:33:57.816 --> 01:34:01.121
I promised you pain and death.

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:04.152
Elf. Witch.

01:34:13.975 --> 01:34:19.950
With the ashes of Amun Khan
and the blood of Goth Azul

01:34:20.376 --> 01:34:24.955
the God of Death is reborn!

01:34:29.595 --> 01:34:34.139
There is no escape
for you this time.

01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:46.362
Yes, Kullimon.

01:34:48.003 --> 01:34:51.393
So we meet again
for the last time.

01:34:53.847 --> 01:34:58.810
Your pet Elf is about to die.

01:35:01.267 --> 01:35:05.053
You will die of shame,
Mulgrut the Damned.

01:36:26.073 --> 01:36:27.042
I ...

01:36:27.105 --> 01:36:28.225
... am ...

01:36:28.346 --> 01:36:30.995
... immortal!

01:37:12.089 --> 01:37:14.433
I ... I failed.

01:37:15.009 --> 01:37:17.371
You did your part.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.855
Now Keltus must do his.

01:39:21.931 --> 01:39:23.752
She's dying.

01:39:29.988 --> 01:39:33.525
We have overcome the Shadow.
You're free.

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:39.209
Help me, Keltus.

01:39:55.977 --> 01:39:58.386
Nemyt...

01:40:37.687 --> 01:40:39.846
What ... what happened?

01:40:41.393 --> 01:40:43.600
You died!
- What?

01:40:48.681 --> 01:40:50.811
You brought me back.

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.458
As I was brought back.

01:40:58.654 --> 01:41:01.413
So, Your Holiness...

01:41:01.764 --> 01:41:06.562
Any magic left in those puny hands
to heal an old Orc's wounds?

01:41:07.415 --> 01:41:11.956
I don't want to waste it.
Anyway, you heal quick, don't you?

01:41:19.353 --> 01:41:23.139
75, 150, 600 men.

01:41:23.261 --> 01:41:25.520
We need a big bag.

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:29.311
Nemyt!
Better get moving.

01:41:29.382 --> 01:41:31.944
The sun's coming up.
This is dragon country.

01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:34.639
Do you not know the bounty
on all these heads?

01:41:34.827 --> 01:41:37.424
Haven't you learned your
lesson about bounties?

01:41:37.716 --> 01:41:41.181
Fine. I'm coming back later.

01:41:50.013 --> 01:41:54.226
We're splitting that money three ways
- How about we all fight for it?

01:41:54.387 --> 01:41:58.815
Why not? You'll end up with nothing.
- Fine by me.

01:41:58.835 --> 01:42:01.585
You two will kill each other
and I walk away with the gold.
