WEBVTT

01:38.588 --> 01:40.356
What's your name?

01:40.389 --> 01:43.828
Um,
Rebecca, what's yours?

01:43.861 --> 01:45.796
I don't know.

01:45.829 --> 01:47.565
What are you doing here?

01:47.597 --> 01:49.632
I have no idea.

01:49.665 --> 01:52.769
I vaguely remember
asking a question.

01:52.802 --> 01:55.338
What was the question?

01:55.371 --> 01:57.507
Daddy, why am I here?

01:57.540 --> 01:59.542
You want to stay up
all night and play.

01:59.576 --> 02:02.913
No Daddy, I don't mean
why am I here in my bedroom.

02:02.945 --> 02:04.414
Why am I here in the world.

02:04.448 --> 02:05.850
What am I here for?

02:09.219 --> 02:12.055
Rebecca, you're deep.

02:12.089 --> 02:14.124
Now go to sleep.

02:15.392 --> 02:17.394
You
mean you don't know?

02:19.029 --> 02:21.698
Do you?

02:21.732 --> 02:23.734
Yes, I did ask
questions like that

02:23.767 --> 02:26.070
when I was a kid. I was deep.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.470
But don't get me wrong.

02:27.504 --> 02:29.072
I'm not that deep.

02:29.106 --> 02:30.608
It really all started

02:30.641 --> 02:33.611
with how most searches for
meaning start... with pain.

02:33.643 --> 02:35.111
Lots of pain.

02:35.144 --> 02:36.779
Everything in my body ached.

02:36.812 --> 02:38.749
I was wracked with
back pain for years,

02:38.781 --> 02:40.784
but lately the pain
had gotten worse.

02:40.816 --> 02:43.186
To top it off, I couldn't
sleep at night anymore

02:43.220 --> 02:44.822
and I couldn't figure out why.

02:44.855 --> 02:46.724
I didn't want to take pills.

02:46.756 --> 02:48.224
You're lonely,

02:48.257 --> 02:49.993
you just need to find the
right guy, someone said.

02:50.026 --> 02:53.930
You're lonely, you need
to find the right guy.

02:55.766 --> 02:58.369
Try acupuncture.

03:00.436 --> 03:02.138
You will feel much better.

03:02.172 --> 03:04.008
Those herbs are for sleep.

03:04.041 --> 03:07.578
You take 30 drops
three times a day.

03:07.611 --> 03:10.513
You will probably go
through a bottle a week.

03:10.547 --> 03:12.149
How much is each bottle?

03:12.181 --> 03:13.784
Is 85.

03:13.816 --> 03:14.718
Dollars?

03:14.750 --> 03:16.587
Yes, and this one is 90.

03:28.899 --> 03:30.300
And this.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.068
Change your bed, they said.

03:32.101 --> 03:33.603
Is our top of the
line, state of the art,

03:33.637 --> 03:34.939
pillow top mattress

03:34.971 --> 03:38.207
with over two and a half
feet of memory foam!

03:38.240 --> 03:39.743
Two and a half feet?

03:39.775 --> 03:42.445
I guarantee, you
will never, ever

03:42.478 --> 03:44.013
want to rise up from this bed.

03:44.047 --> 03:45.049
Amazing.

03:49.486 --> 03:51.322
With over
two and a half feet

03:51.355 --> 03:52.590
of memory foam.

03:52.623 --> 03:55.125
Over two and a half
feet of memory foam.

03:55.157 --> 03:55.993
Ah. Ow.

04:15.712 --> 04:18.349
crickets chirping

04:20.082 --> 04:21.685
Nothing helped.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.988
I cannot help you.

04:29.058 --> 04:31.895
Maybe have to learn to be
happy with what you have.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.798
11th night of insomnia.

04:38.502 --> 04:41.071
Rebecca, is that you?

04:41.103 --> 04:44.240
Blair Mushkinski,
spiritual fanatic

04:44.274 --> 04:47.177
and my best friend's sister
from the third grade.

04:47.209 --> 04:50.147
In 10 seconds she'll push
some religious book on me.

04:50.180 --> 04:53.951
Blair, hi, I didn't
know you came here.

04:53.983 --> 04:55.618
Thank God.

04:55.651 --> 04:57.553
I'm learning The
Garden of Emuna book.

04:57.587 --> 04:59.055
Have you read this book?

04:59.089 --> 05:00.658
It is so amazing.

05:01.558 --> 05:02.493
What's wrong?

05:03.426 --> 05:04.227
Nothing.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.595
You look terrible.

05:05.628 --> 05:06.829
What's going on?

05:06.863 --> 05:08.264
If I start talking
I'll start crying.

05:08.298 --> 05:10.434
Come sit with me, I'm
learning The Garden of Emuna.

05:10.466 --> 05:11.368
The Garden of what?

05:11.401 --> 05:13.070
Emuna, you know, like faith.

05:13.103 --> 05:14.538
It's the Hebrew word for faith.

05:14.570 --> 05:15.938
And you're learning this why?

05:15.971 --> 05:16.774
It's my mother.

05:16.807 --> 05:17.608
She's forcing you.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.442
Oh, God forbid, no,

05:19.476 --> 05:22.279
it's just since she's
been reading this book

05:22.312 --> 05:25.049
she's been kind of nice to me.

05:25.082 --> 05:28.851
She smiles a lot and
she just seems happy.

05:28.885 --> 05:30.788
Your mother, really?

05:30.820 --> 05:33.156
Sorry to say this, but
your mother, happy?

05:33.190 --> 05:35.024
Oh, you know everything
she went through in her life.

05:35.058 --> 05:35.959
So how do you explain it?

05:35.991 --> 05:38.361
She read this book, thank God.

05:38.394 --> 05:40.430
So I thought, if it
could make her happy.

05:41.832 --> 05:44.702
Look, don't be alone right
now, come sit with me.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.271
That's
the thing about desperation.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.106
You're so much more
open to things.

05:49.139 --> 05:51.475
These are the
principles of faith.

05:51.507 --> 05:55.478
Number one,
everything good or bad

05:55.512 --> 05:56.613
comes from God.

05:56.646 --> 06:00.784
Number two, it's
all for the best

06:00.817 --> 06:04.288
even if we can't see
why at the moment.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.788
This is it?

06:05.822 --> 06:08.158
The magical book
that made your mother happy?

06:08.190 --> 06:11.060
That's it, it's
all for the best?

06:11.094 --> 06:15.165
So all the garbage and
suffering we go through

06:15.197 --> 06:17.767
every single day
is for the best?

06:17.800 --> 06:18.901
I love you, Blair,

06:18.935 --> 06:21.639
but it's not for me, I'm sorry.

06:22.805 --> 06:25.276
Over-simplified
religious propaganda.

06:28.277 --> 06:31.080
It's all for the best.

06:31.113 --> 06:33.282
It's
all for the best.

06:33.315 --> 06:35.719
It's
all for the best.

06:35.752 --> 06:37.755
12th night of insomnia.

06:37.788 --> 06:38.589
Ah!

06:42.491 --> 06:44.761
I can't take it anymore,

06:44.795 --> 06:46.062
what do you want from me?

06:46.096 --> 06:46.997
Ah!

06:47.029 --> 06:49.899
I'll do anything, help me!

06:49.933 --> 06:51.135
Ahhh!

06:52.269 --> 06:54.437
OK, God, I've tried
everything else.

06:54.471 --> 06:57.041
I don't exactly know what
I'm doing here, but OK.

06:58.175 --> 07:00.410
It's all from You,
it's all for the best.

07:00.442 --> 07:01.277
Ah!

07:03.212 --> 07:07.416
This
sleeplessness is from You.

07:07.450 --> 07:09.152
Help me!

07:09.185 --> 07:10.587
These pains from You,

07:10.620 --> 07:13.223
all my loneliness and
fears are from You.

07:13.255 --> 07:16.425
It must be for the best,
it's from You, right?

07:16.459 --> 07:17.560
Ah!

07:21.264 --> 07:22.599
I'll just have faith.

07:22.632 --> 07:23.867
Ah!

07:23.899 --> 07:25.501
I'll choose
to have faith.

07:25.534 --> 07:26.369
Help me.

07:27.803 --> 07:30.940
It's all from You, it's
all for the best.

07:33.243 --> 07:37.447
If this is what You want
from me right now then

07:39.014 --> 07:40.450
I accept it.

07:41.651 --> 07:43.287
I accept it.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
I accept it.

07:45.288 --> 07:46.389
I accept it.

07:47.990 --> 07:49.894
And I felt calm.

07:51.527 --> 07:56.533
That night, for the first
time in a long time, I slept.

07:58.101 --> 08:00.571
Excuse me, do you have
The Garden of Emuna book?

08:00.603 --> 08:01.938
I can't find it anywhere.

08:01.971 --> 08:04.240
Sorry, Geveret,
completely sold out.

08:04.274 --> 08:05.475
Geveret?

08:05.507 --> 08:06.642
It means
Mrs. in Hebrew.

08:06.675 --> 08:08.312
It's OK, Rebecca,
we'll just use my book.

08:08.344 --> 08:09.812
But I wanted my own copy.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.315
We can order it.

08:11.348 --> 08:13.617
Look, The Garden of Emuna is
Rebbe Nachman's teachings,

08:13.649 --> 08:15.051
but you can also
read his stories.

08:15.084 --> 08:16.486
He had stories?

08:16.519 --> 08:20.624
Oh, yes, they're
very mystical, really esoteric,

08:20.656 --> 08:23.894
so kabbalistic, I barely understand
them, but I love them.

08:23.926 --> 08:26.329
My favorite is the one with
The Fixer and the King.

08:26.363 --> 08:27.564
Here.

08:27.596 --> 08:29.031
You know he was
born in the Ukraine.

08:29.065 --> 08:30.033
Who is?

08:30.065 --> 08:31.267
Rebbe Nachman.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.469
I was there once to
visit his grave site.

08:33.502 --> 08:35.538
Completely changed my life.

08:55.425 --> 08:57.928
I know it's all from God
and it's all for the best,

08:57.960 --> 09:01.230
but if I have to go
on another blind date

09:01.263 --> 09:03.566
I will shoot myself.

09:03.599 --> 09:04.500
That doesn't sound like you,

09:04.533 --> 09:06.636
you're inspiring, not suicidal.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.473
I've reached a point,
I'm ready to do anything.

09:09.506 --> 09:12.476
You're still thinking
about liposuction?

09:12.508 --> 09:13.476
Uman.

09:13.509 --> 09:14.644
Uman, what is that?

09:14.677 --> 09:15.912
Is that a new
surgical technique?

09:15.945 --> 09:18.114
No, the Ukraine, where
Rebbe Nachman is buried.

09:18.147 --> 09:19.382
Let's go, what do you say?

09:19.416 --> 09:22.084
What, are you crazy?

09:22.118 --> 09:24.588
What, is she crazy?

09:24.621 --> 09:27.324
Look, you got to be careful
about going on these group trips

09:27.357 --> 09:29.392
to tour these remote areas.

09:29.425 --> 09:32.963
My Uncle Daryl went to
Uganda on a group trip,

09:32.996 --> 09:34.665
uch, we never saw him again.

09:34.698 --> 09:39.036
Rebecca, I am telling you,
people have had real miracles

09:39.069 --> 09:40.771
after going to Uman.

09:40.804 --> 09:42.039
Couldn't you use a
miracle right now?

09:42.071 --> 09:43.339
Couldn't we both?

09:43.373 --> 09:45.041
Blair, just get it
through your head,

09:45.075 --> 09:47.310
there's nothing on this
earth that would ever

09:47.344 --> 09:48.811
make me go to Ukraine.

09:48.844 --> 09:50.846
Ach. Hmm.

09:50.879 --> 09:52.749
Ahhhhhhh!

10:18.842 --> 10:20.244
Oh, no.

10:33.022 --> 10:36.292
So
there I was in Uman in July,

10:37.324 --> 10:38.627
over 100 degrees temperature.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.537
We lost our hotel rooms,

10:49.004 --> 10:51.841
had to stay in bunk beds
with six to 12 in a room.

10:54.676 --> 10:56.980
One bathroom for 20 women.

11:00.416 --> 11:03.586
Needless to say, it was a miracle
we didn't kill each other.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.559
People from all over
the world travel here

11:10.593 --> 11:13.163
to the grave site of
Rebbe Nachman of Breslov,

11:13.195 --> 11:15.498
whose teachings on
faith were the basis

11:15.531 --> 11:17.100
of the book we'd been learning.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.202
This was it?

11:20.235 --> 11:22.071
Rebbe Nachman's grave site?

11:22.104 --> 11:27.110
No bells, no whistles, just
desperate people praying to God,

11:27.709 --> 11:29.679
but I felt lost.

11:29.711 --> 11:31.080
I couldn't connect.

12:59.935 --> 13:01.738
You do realize there are

13:01.771 --> 13:03.339
11 other
women in this room

13:03.373 --> 13:05.142
besides you?

13:07.743 --> 13:09.846
Did someone move the fan?

13:20.256 --> 13:21.525
Crazy night, huh?

13:23.026 --> 13:26.061
I can be a little sensitive
to noise at night.

13:26.094 --> 13:27.897
It's not exactly
the Waldorf, is it?

13:27.930 --> 13:29.900
No, it's not the Waldorf.

13:29.932 --> 13:31.967
- But I don't mind it.
- You don't?

13:32.001 --> 13:34.938
No. Honestly, I'm at
that point in my life

13:34.970 --> 13:36.438
where a smile means more to me

13:36.472 --> 13:38.108
than a goose down
feather pillow.

13:38.141 --> 13:41.411
Rebbe Nachman would go out
into these fields every day

13:41.444 --> 13:43.979
by himself, for at
least an hour a day

13:44.012 --> 13:45.482
and speak to God.

13:45.515 --> 13:47.017
I'd love a goose down
feather pillow right now.

13:47.050 --> 13:49.286
Baruch Hashem, I spent a
lot of time with your daughter

13:49.319 --> 13:50.520
when she was in Florida.

13:50.552 --> 13:51.987
She's a lovely, lovely girl.

13:52.021 --> 13:53.890
She should find a
wonderful boy very soon.

13:53.922 --> 13:55.224
Thank you so much.

13:55.257 --> 13:56.859
It's just nice to
be around people.

13:56.892 --> 13:58.460
For me it depends
on the people.

13:58.493 --> 14:01.464
You OK to hike in
those flimsy shoes?

14:01.497 --> 14:03.333
They're year old
Manolo Blahniks.

14:03.366 --> 14:04.901
I was gonna throw
them out anyway.

14:04.934 --> 14:05.969
Humph!

14:06.002 --> 14:06.902
I'm a writer.

14:06.935 --> 14:08.070
I spend a lot of time alone.

14:08.103 --> 14:09.573
What kind of writer are you?

14:09.605 --> 14:13.075
I write a health / healing
column for Ohm Magazine.

14:13.108 --> 14:14.143
Have you heard of it?

14:14.176 --> 14:15.545
Yeah, I think so.

14:15.578 --> 14:17.881
You've never heard
of it, no one has,

14:17.914 --> 14:20.483
but it is the biggest
magazine that deals with

14:20.516 --> 14:23.053
the whole
mind-body-healing issue.

14:23.085 --> 14:24.887
Well, they were the biggest.

14:24.921 --> 14:28.190
They're downsizing, so they
fired me two weeks ago.

14:28.224 --> 14:30.259
That's rough.

14:30.292 --> 14:31.695
How have you been
spending your time?

14:31.728 --> 14:33.630
Mostly kvetching.

14:33.662 --> 14:35.097
When I was little,

14:35.131 --> 14:37.200
my mother would see me walk
into the kitchen in the morning

14:37.233 --> 14:39.636
and she'd say, "Look
it's the kvetcher".

14:39.669 --> 14:41.638
"She's up and she's kvetching."

14:41.671 --> 14:43.105
Well they'll have
other names for it,

14:43.138 --> 14:46.942
depression, anxiety, personality
disorder, yada, yada, yada.

14:46.975 --> 14:48.677
So why are you here?

14:48.710 --> 14:50.946
Do you have to know why
you're here to be here?

14:50.979 --> 14:52.349
Well, it doesn't hurt.

14:53.983 --> 14:55.986
See that woman over there?

14:56.018 --> 14:57.453
She wants to get pregnant.

14:57.487 --> 15:01.024
Marital problems, money
problems, yada, yada, yada.

15:01.056 --> 15:02.925
And that's Rebetzen Eliana.

15:04.193 --> 15:06.396
I've heard some interesting
stuff about her.

15:06.429 --> 15:09.332
She knows things about
you, she's very intuitive.

15:09.364 --> 15:11.868
People go to her all the
time with their problems.

15:13.603 --> 15:17.140
Ah! Rebetzen Eliana

15:17.172 --> 15:20.809
I wonder if I could
ask you a question.

15:20.843 --> 15:24.147
I'm Brenda, by the
way, from New York.

15:25.047 --> 15:28.984
I heard so much about you

15:29.017 --> 15:33.189
and I had this crazy
dream last night.

15:33.222 --> 15:35.925
Maybe you could tell
me what it means.

15:37.359 --> 15:41.864
I am walking down the aisle
wearing this long white dress.

15:42.598 --> 15:44.067
I got to the chuppah

15:44.099 --> 15:49.105
and who turns around
but Julio Iglesias.

15:50.506 --> 15:53.108
Anyway, in the beginning,

15:53.142 --> 15:55.712
Julio and I were so happy

15:57.546 --> 16:00.651
but then something changed.

16:02.050 --> 16:05.454
These strange women started
showing up at our door.

16:06.888 --> 16:11.627
Well of course, my Yan,
looked a little like Julio

16:12.494 --> 16:14.196
but he never cheated on me.

16:15.998 --> 16:19.236
At least not that I know of.

16:21.002 --> 16:22.538
What do you think?

17:20.095 --> 17:21.430
- Didn't you see the sign?
- What?

17:21.463 --> 17:23.132
You are number 82 aren't you?

17:23.165 --> 17:25.167
Um, yeah.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.471
And you're still
standing there because why?

17:29.505 --> 17:30.774
Why?

17:30.806 --> 17:32.575
Why does everyone have the same

17:32.607 --> 17:34.610
idiotic expression
on their face?

17:34.643 --> 17:36.845
Sometimes it makes
me want to scream.

17:38.713 --> 17:39.948
Do you have any
idea where you are?

17:39.981 --> 17:41.250
You did get the invitation.

17:41.284 --> 17:45.220
Come on, come one, put
a spring in your step,

17:45.254 --> 17:48.091
Miss I Don't Know Why
I'm Here On This Earth,

17:48.123 --> 17:49.692
you're not the only one waiting.

17:51.126 --> 17:53.695
Well, I don't know what
you said or what you did,

17:53.728 --> 17:56.833
but apparently you
got ahead of the line.

18:02.171 --> 18:03.907
Ahead of all these people.

18:04.841 --> 18:06.508
And look how miserable they are.

18:16.251 --> 18:19.655
But at least they're
better than these idiots.

18:19.689 --> 18:22.926
They don't even know
anything's wrong.

18:35.537 --> 18:37.106
I have nothing to say.

18:50.686 --> 18:52.021
- Assist, please.
- What?

18:52.054 --> 18:54.291
I can't do this
without you, Rebecca.

18:55.991 --> 18:57.059
What's wrong with her?

18:57.994 --> 18:59.529
What isn't wrong with her?

18:59.562 --> 19:01.898
- Can it be fixed?
- Maybe.

19:03.732 --> 19:06.602
- If you help.
- How?

19:06.635 --> 19:08.770
- Tell me the truth.
- About what?

19:08.804 --> 19:09.439
Yourself.

19:09.471 --> 19:10.573
What do you want to know?

19:10.605 --> 19:12.575
Why are you here?

19:12.607 --> 19:13.842
You hate computers

19:13.875 --> 19:16.478
but you spend all your
days working on them.

19:16.511 --> 19:18.914
You've dreamt your whole
life of making films

19:18.948 --> 19:20.883
but instead you
color-correct them?

19:22.218 --> 19:24.554
Intellectually, you
believe in a benevolent God

19:24.586 --> 19:29.157
but you've never
really been able to feel it.

19:29.190 --> 19:31.059
And the people closest to you

19:31.093 --> 19:33.596
have no idea who you are inside.

19:36.298 --> 19:40.302
♪ Is it any wonder ♪

19:40.335 --> 19:43.172
♪ You feel alone all the time? ♪

19:44.539 --> 19:46.876
Who are you?

19:47.977 --> 19:49.679
Are you a surgeon
or a psychic?

19:49.711 --> 19:50.513
Come with me.

19:52.614 --> 19:53.450
Eli.

19:59.622 --> 20:01.056
Where are we?

20:01.090 --> 20:02.893
You want to make
films, don't you?

20:05.460 --> 20:06.728
Warner Renquist?

20:06.761 --> 20:07.829
The King of Hollywood?

20:07.863 --> 20:08.765
This is great.

20:08.797 --> 20:10.432
You could introduce me

20:10.466 --> 20:12.068
to the head of Warner
Renquist Studios?

20:13.568 --> 20:15.704
Wait, shouldn't we knock?

20:16.805 --> 20:19.042
Sh, watch.

20:29.117 --> 20:32.287
Stavros says you're
safe from that bean lawsuit

20:32.321 --> 20:36.926
Stavros says we're safe
from that bean lawsuit.

20:36.959 --> 20:38.327
Safe from that bean lawsuit.

20:38.361 --> 20:39.862
Stavros... is an

20:39.894 --> 20:41.998
incompetent fool.

20:42.030 --> 20:43.165
Uch, his breath stinks.

20:43.199 --> 20:44.734
Wait, what is this?

20:44.767 --> 20:46.803
I didn't see anyone talking.

20:46.835 --> 20:49.572
Oh, you're hearing
his inner thoughts.

20:49.604 --> 20:50.873
I can do that?

20:52.107 --> 20:53.375
With me you can.

20:53.409 --> 20:55.011
Do I have
enough in that offshore account

20:55.044 --> 20:57.280
to cover the resort remodel?

20:57.313 --> 21:00.416
Should never have
trusted that accountant.

21:00.449 --> 21:01.383
Dinky.

21:01.417 --> 21:02.619
Dinky.

21:02.651 --> 21:05.354
Hi, my name's Dinky
and I'm stupid.

21:05.388 --> 21:07.457
Sell that stock.

21:07.489 --> 21:08.557
What are you waiting for?

21:10.125 --> 21:14.196
I have to go to that darned
orthopedist for the knee.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.670
He can't sleep either.

21:20.702 --> 21:21.837
Darned knee!

21:21.871 --> 21:23.873
Darned knee!

21:23.905 --> 21:25.974
Darned knee!

21:30.979 --> 21:33.716
Teras, so I
know so much about, you know?

21:33.748 --> 21:35.817
The work
published and performed.

21:35.851 --> 21:38.354
The composer and pianist,
who lives in New York City.

21:48.497 --> 21:50.999
Another cappuccino,
Roberto, pronto.

21:51.967 --> 21:53.703
Honey, it's your fifth.

21:53.736 --> 21:56.072
You have your green
juices, I have my caffeine.

21:56.104 --> 21:57.239
How do you expect me to function

21:57.273 --> 21:58.940
after not sleeping all night?

22:03.778 --> 22:05.314
I can't stand them.

22:05.346 --> 22:06.148
Who?

22:06.181 --> 22:07.083
Happy people.

22:07.115 --> 22:08.383
What, honey?

22:08.417 --> 22:10.586
I said, I have three
islands, seven homes,

22:10.619 --> 22:13.089
thousands of
servants, employees.

22:13.122 --> 22:14.824
I frickin' own half of Hollywood

22:14.856 --> 22:16.325
and yet I'm miserable.

22:16.357 --> 22:17.592
And if I'm miserable
with all this,

22:17.625 --> 22:19.628
then no one has a
right to be happy.

22:19.661 --> 22:21.329
If anybody out there
is happier than I am

22:21.363 --> 22:22.265
I will kill them.

22:22.297 --> 22:23.700
I will freakin' kill them.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.301
No one's allowed to have
less worries than I do.

22:26.334 --> 22:27.703
What are you smiling about?

22:29.537 --> 22:32.541
I had no idea he
was so miserable.

22:34.642 --> 22:35.944
That's it!

22:35.978 --> 22:38.881
Some call him the
King of Sadness.

22:40.082 --> 22:41.084
Where is he going?

22:47.422 --> 22:49.659
No one
has a right to be happy.

22:51.293 --> 22:52.695
If there's somebody out
there who's happier than I am

22:52.728 --> 22:53.763
I will kill them.

22:53.796 --> 22:55.832
I will freakin' kill them.

23:09.644 --> 23:10.846
What's gonna happen to her

23:10.880 --> 23:12.015
when I'm gone?

23:13.882 --> 23:15.050
Is he smiling?

23:16.951 --> 23:18.353
He does seem satisfied.

23:20.088 --> 23:21.757
Who's gonna help me

23:21.790 --> 23:23.692
when I can't walk anymore?

23:24.660 --> 23:26.696
Why is he smiling?

23:26.728 --> 23:28.831
Misery loves company.

23:28.863 --> 23:30.632
I picked Jason up
from soccer practice

23:30.665 --> 23:33.535
after waiting an hour
and he just glares at me.

23:33.568 --> 23:35.403
Two years ago he worshiped
the ground I walked on,

23:35.437 --> 23:37.106
now it's the silent treatment.

23:37.139 --> 23:39.142
Between him and this one
I don't sleep anymore.

23:39.174 --> 23:40.342
Why didn't I have kids

23:40.375 --> 23:42.545
when I had the chance?

23:42.577 --> 23:43.779
COMPLAINING MOTHER
VOICEOVER: I don't know

23:43.813 --> 23:45.281
how much longer
I can keep going.

23:47.950 --> 23:50.219
I'll never get a job.

23:52.153 --> 23:55.190
I hate my job.

23:55.223 --> 23:57.392
I wish I
was doing something I love.

23:58.294 --> 23:59.528
Why can't
I make a living

23:59.562 --> 24:01.430
doing what I love?

24:01.462 --> 24:03.598
Need a
vacation, I'm exhausted.

24:03.632 --> 24:05.200
Just
got back from vacation

24:05.234 --> 24:06.235
and I'm exhausted.

24:07.736 --> 24:09.472
What
am I gonna do with my life?

24:09.505 --> 24:11.040
What
if I end up alone?

24:12.507 --> 24:14.442
He
doesn't call, he doesn't call.

24:14.476 --> 24:15.945
Why doesn't he call?

24:15.978 --> 24:18.214
How could I
get Jenny to go out with me?

24:30.825 --> 24:34.229
It's OK, soon
they'll turn into them.

24:34.263 --> 24:35.998
I don't get it.

24:36.030 --> 24:37.933
How did they?

24:37.967 --> 24:39.768
Turn into that?

24:39.802 --> 24:43.473
Worries, fears,
anxiety, sadness.

24:59.755 --> 25:02.024
Why is he so happy?

25:54.410 --> 25:56.946
He lives
alone in a crumbling shack.

25:56.978 --> 25:58.748
What's he so happy about?

26:01.216 --> 26:03.419
!@*#$!@#!

26:16.498 --> 26:19.735
That's it, I'm goin' in!

26:39.455 --> 26:41.057
Hello.

26:41.090 --> 26:42.491
Hello, sir.

26:42.524 --> 26:44.459
Haven't eaten in three days.

26:44.492 --> 26:46.828
Wondering if you could
spare some food? I...

26:49.064 --> 26:50.032
Is that herb-crusted
beef, with...

26:51.566 --> 26:53.001
scalloped potatoes and...

26:54.902 --> 26:57.172
couscous?

26:57.206 --> 27:02.211
Now that is simply
amazing.

27:03.612 --> 27:05.815
You've got the quite the
nose on yourself, don't you?

27:05.847 --> 27:08.283
Well, you have to
come inside now.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.824
I drink to you, my friend.

27:48.856 --> 27:51.192
May your cupboards
be full of couscous,

27:51.226 --> 27:55.664
your mind clear of
clutter and your heart,

27:55.697 --> 27:58.133
may your heart be
filled with joy.

28:03.171 --> 28:04.640
Thank you, my friend.

28:06.107 --> 28:07.042
Thank you.

28:18.786 --> 28:20.989
Who are you?

28:34.001 --> 28:37.172
So you have a feast
like that every night?

28:37.206 --> 28:39.842
Yeah, yeah, I don't
go a day without it.

28:39.874 --> 28:41.844
How long you been doin' it?

28:42.744 --> 28:44.147
Ever since I can remember.

28:45.581 --> 28:49.151
But how can you afford
all that food every night?

28:49.183 --> 28:50.885
I'm a fixer.

28:50.919 --> 28:52.955
A repairman, you know, I
can't really make anything

28:52.988 --> 28:56.258
but, why, I can fix
just about anything.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.628
So in the morning, I go out

29:00.696 --> 29:03.265
and I fix things.

29:03.297 --> 29:06.768
Once I've made 40 bucks I buy
all the food and drink I need

29:06.802 --> 29:08.938
and I go home.

29:08.970 --> 29:10.472
That's great, that's great.

29:10.506 --> 29:12.440
But tell me, where do you
get all your fixing work?

29:12.473 --> 29:15.343
The studio, you
know, Renquist Studios?

29:15.376 --> 29:17.212
They've known me
since I was a boy.

29:18.146 --> 29:20.548
My father used to work for them.

29:20.582 --> 29:22.818
I'm not on the
books or anything,

29:22.851 --> 29:24.053
but I just help out
when they need it

29:24.085 --> 29:27.355
and they sort of just
pay me on the spot.

29:27.389 --> 29:28.724
- How nice.
- Yeah.

29:30.057 --> 29:32.827
That's right, you heard me.

29:32.861 --> 29:34.964
If I hear of anyone
giving any work

29:34.997 --> 29:38.300
to any bugger who's
not on the payroll,

29:38.333 --> 29:41.769
I will personally grind
their bones into dust

29:41.803 --> 29:43.639
while they're sleeping!

29:43.671 --> 29:44.507
Got me?

29:50.511 --> 29:52.780
Sorry Larry, I don't have
any work for you today.

29:52.814 --> 29:55.584
Oh, that's OK, Bob.

29:55.616 --> 29:57.418
Not a problem at all.

30:02.990 --> 30:05.594
I'm sorry, Larry,
there's nothing.

30:05.626 --> 30:06.728
Are you sure?

30:06.761 --> 30:08.630
There's a broken
wheelbarrow right there.

30:08.663 --> 30:12.033
It's supposed to be broken

30:12.066 --> 30:13.001
for the scene.

30:15.938 --> 30:18.841
Oh, OK it's all right.

30:20.609 --> 30:23.346
It's OK, hey, hey, hey.

30:26.113 --> 30:26.949
I'll see ya'.

30:32.888 --> 30:35.691
I feel terrible,
Larry, I really do.

30:35.723 --> 30:38.827
I just hope your Dad, may God
rest his soul, forgives me,

30:39.861 --> 30:42.164
but we can't hire you anymore.

30:42.197 --> 30:45.633
Oh, Douglas, I've been
fixin' stuff for you guys...

30:45.667 --> 30:47.303
- Since you were six.
- Yeah.

30:47.335 --> 30:48.570
I know it, Larry,

30:48.603 --> 30:51.273
and you're better than
anyone on the payroll.

30:51.305 --> 30:53.875
So then, then, why?

30:56.911 --> 31:00.615
The King said no
more non-payroll hires

31:00.649 --> 31:02.685
for fixing jobs.

31:05.754 --> 31:10.726
Huh.

31:39.321 --> 31:41.557
God,
I know this is from You.

31:41.590 --> 31:44.827
I know
this is for the best.

32:13.287 --> 32:15.356
We're not following him?

32:15.390 --> 32:17.293
I just need to rest a minute.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.656
What just happened?

32:58.967 --> 33:02.470
You need
a hand with that?

33:02.504 --> 33:04.473
Dude, you like read my mind.

33:04.506 --> 33:06.776
Honestly never used
one of these before.

33:07.976 --> 33:10.478
Well, let me take
it off your hands.

33:10.511 --> 33:13.915
I'm sure you've got much more
important things to be doing.

33:13.949 --> 33:15.984
Dude, thanks.

33:18.386 --> 33:20.588
Dude, you like
saved my life, man.

33:20.622 --> 33:24.426
Honestly, this is
worth every peso.

33:24.459 --> 33:27.863
The pleasure's all
mine, dude.

33:29.765 --> 33:33.002
Can't wait to see
a grown man cry.

33:36.270 --> 33:38.473
Mmm, what smells so good?

33:39.373 --> 33:40.608
Eggplant?

33:42.811 --> 33:43.712
What?

33:48.950 --> 33:51.586
Eggplant Parmesan?

33:54.956 --> 33:55.791
Garlic bread?

33:57.892 --> 34:01.196
Caramel apple
crostata for dessert?

34:01.228 --> 34:04.065
Got it, come on in.

34:18.113 --> 34:19.248
Awww.

34:19.281 --> 34:20.116
Ay.

34:26.922 --> 34:28.891
I drink to you, my friend.

34:30.357 --> 34:34.263
May your cupboards always
be full of crostata.

34:34.296 --> 34:36.198
Your mind clear of clutter

34:36.230 --> 34:38.667
and your heart filled with joy.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.169
Come here, my brother.

34:43.103 --> 34:45.540
Thank you, thank you.

34:46.707 --> 34:48.075
I drooled on your sweater.

34:48.109 --> 34:50.078
Oh, no, I'll wash it
out, it's all right.

34:50.111 --> 34:51.413
It's wine but...

34:52.980 --> 34:56.017
It's funny, he never has any
trouble falling asleep here.

34:58.386 --> 35:00.122
Who are you?

35:01.489 --> 35:03.991
So, were you fixing
things on the lot again?

35:04.024 --> 35:06.027
Is that how you got
the money for the food?

35:06.060 --> 35:10.732
No, no, apparently the big
cheese, King of the studio,

35:12.167 --> 35:16.438
he forbade any non-studio
hires for repairs yesterday.

35:16.471 --> 35:21.076
So I couldn't find a job, but
then I bumped into this guy

35:21.109 --> 35:25.380
trying to cut wood for a film
set and I helped him out.

35:25.413 --> 35:26.448
He paid me.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.216
- How wonderful.
- Yeah.

35:29.518 --> 35:33.589
Hey dude, more wood
for choppin'?

35:33.622 --> 35:35.123
Dude, I wish,

35:35.156 --> 35:39.594
but I got in some serious
trouble about manana.

35:39.627 --> 35:42.263
I mean, yesterday.

35:42.297 --> 35:46.001
No more non-studio
hires, sorry dude.

35:46.033 --> 35:47.969
I wish I could use ya'.

35:48.002 --> 35:49.805
Oh, no, it's OK,

35:49.837 --> 35:52.006
I understand.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.710
- I
- know this is from You.

35:57.478 --> 36:01.049
God, I know
that this is for the best.

36:15.430 --> 36:16.665
You don't want to follow him?

36:16.698 --> 36:19.167
Hold on, I'm thirsty.

36:38.453 --> 36:39.988
I don't get it,
what's in there,

36:40.020 --> 36:42.490
an amusement park or somethin'?

36:59.873 --> 37:01.442
Ohh.

37:02.877 --> 37:03.779
Ohhh.

37:03.812 --> 37:06.381
Larchmont, what happened?

37:06.413 --> 37:10.352
Ah, I slipped on
a banana, Larry.

37:10.384 --> 37:13.220
That's a good
one, you slipped on a banana.

37:13.254 --> 37:14.989
I really slipped on a banana.

37:15.022 --> 37:16.524
Oh.

37:16.558 --> 37:18.393
If I don't finish cleaning
these stables by end o' day

37:18.426 --> 37:20.495
they're going to fire me.

37:20.527 --> 37:22.830
They already
grumbling I too old.

37:22.864 --> 37:24.399
And you know what?

37:24.431 --> 37:25.634
They're right.

37:25.667 --> 37:28.536
Larchmont, you
leave this to me.

38:18.152 --> 38:20.288
- Don't you look happy.
- What?

38:20.321 --> 38:22.190
You were smiling and
dancing in your sleep.

38:22.223 --> 38:23.625
- No I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

38:23.658 --> 38:25.993
You were even singing,
it woke me up.

38:26.027 --> 38:27.529
No.

38:27.562 --> 38:29.464
- You were.
- Oh, yeah.

38:35.502 --> 38:36.738
Ah.

38:41.308 --> 38:42.143
Ah.

38:50.151 --> 38:50.951
Ah.

38:50.984 --> 38:51.953
Hey.

38:58.192 --> 39:00.428
So how's the wood
chopping business?

39:00.462 --> 39:01.897
Well, I wouldn't know.

39:01.930 --> 39:05.933
King of Hollywood outlawed
outsiders from chopping wood.

39:05.966 --> 39:07.501
If I didn't know better,

39:07.535 --> 39:10.238
I would say the King
was out to get me.

39:14.109 --> 39:15.977
That's ridiculous, isn't it?

39:16.009 --> 39:17.845
Of course.

39:19.413 --> 39:21.917
But I bumped into this guy
cleaning out stables on set

39:21.950 --> 39:25.786
and I helped him out and
he was pretty grateful.

39:25.819 --> 39:28.457
Fantastic.

39:30.591 --> 39:32.760
I don't know how
they found out, Larry,

39:32.794 --> 39:34.429
but they found out.

39:34.462 --> 39:38.100
They say if I hire you
again I'm finished.

39:38.132 --> 39:41.002
Or my bones probably
will be ground into dust.

39:42.636 --> 39:46.707
You know, my ex-son-in-law,
don't pay no child support.

39:46.741 --> 39:49.277
I gotta help my
little girl, Larry.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.113
I gotta hold on to this job.

40:05.393 --> 40:08.530
God,
I know this is from You.

40:08.562 --> 40:10.832
I know that this
is for the best.

40:14.201 --> 40:16.036
We're not gonna
follow him, are we?

40:16.069 --> 40:19.341
You're a smarty-pants,
aren't you?

40:36.623 --> 40:37.926
Meketo mi bon bon.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.462
Son of a *#@!

40:41.495 --> 40:42.930
Don't count that.

40:57.911 --> 41:00.314
You
hear me Corporal Sagget?!

41:01.649 --> 41:03.185
Sagget!

41:03.218 --> 41:07.489
We need 200 more
soldiers, Pronto!

41:07.522 --> 41:09.090
But sir,

41:09.122 --> 41:10.858
no one's volunteering.

41:10.892 --> 41:13.127
No buts, Sagget.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.329
Just recruits.

41:15.363 --> 41:16.163
Do

41:16.196 --> 41:16.997
you

41:17.031 --> 41:17.833
hear

41:17.866 --> 41:20.134
meeeeee?!!!!!!!

41:21.169 --> 41:22.103
Yes, sir!

41:27.341 --> 41:31.245
Hand me a three wood
if you would there, um.

41:31.279 --> 41:32.247
Yes, sir.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.162
Excuse me.

41:49.596 --> 41:51.466
I saw the sign?

41:51.498 --> 41:52.567
That's great.

41:53.701 --> 41:55.837
I mean, you did?

41:55.870 --> 41:58.406
Yeah, Larry Fixer.

41:58.439 --> 42:00.174
Most people just
call me the Fixer.

42:01.743 --> 42:05.145
You are still seeking soldiers
for temporary service?

42:05.178 --> 42:06.981
You're looking for
the short-term option.

42:07.015 --> 42:08.616
Yeah, I hope that's doable.

42:08.649 --> 42:10.718
Don't see why not.

42:10.752 --> 42:12.786
Oh, there is just one thing.

42:12.819 --> 42:15.022
I would need to
leave every night.

42:16.056 --> 42:17.892
Sure, we can do that.

42:19.294 --> 42:22.196
Oh, and I would need
to be paid every morning.

42:22.230 --> 42:23.198
Is that possible?

42:24.399 --> 42:25.234
Ahhhhh!

42:26.801 --> 42:29.237
I think we can
work something out.

43:15.082 --> 43:16.550
Hey.

44:09.569 --> 44:11.138
Who are you?

44:13.241 --> 44:14.843
So I guess
work's going OK?

44:14.875 --> 44:16.477
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

44:16.511 --> 44:19.514
but it seems the work at the
studio is all finished for me.

44:20.547 --> 44:21.950
No one will hire me.

44:21.982 --> 44:23.484
- No.
- Yeah.

44:23.518 --> 44:24.953
What are you gonna do?

44:24.986 --> 44:27.388
It's too bad you can't
make your feasts anymore.

44:27.422 --> 44:29.190
Oh, no, I can still do 'em.

44:29.223 --> 44:32.594
Yeah, I saw this sign
for soldiers for hire

44:32.627 --> 44:35.296
and as soon as I found out they
would pay me every morning,

44:35.328 --> 44:36.364
I signed right up.

44:37.631 --> 44:39.299
What a miracle.

44:39.332 --> 44:41.635
I am so happy for you.

45:02.924 --> 45:03.725
Yes, sir.

45:04.692 --> 45:05.493
No, sir.

45:06.359 --> 45:07.161
Yes, sir.

45:08.428 --> 45:09.229
Understood, sir.

45:10.297 --> 45:11.466
Loud and clear.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.504
Marge, get the Fixer
in here, pronto,

45:16.703 --> 45:21.709
Ah. Hmmm. Ummm. Brrr. Ummm.

45:24.444 --> 45:25.980
Can't pay you today, Fixer.

45:28.149 --> 45:29.350
Oh, but we had an agreement

45:29.382 --> 45:30.618
that you would pay me every day.

45:30.651 --> 45:32.654
True, but the
Captain just called,

45:32.687 --> 45:35.390
the King decreed that
no one gets paid today.

45:35.422 --> 45:36.390
The King, what King?

45:36.424 --> 45:38.692
You know, Renquist.

45:38.725 --> 45:41.628
Oh, Renquist, like
the studio Renquist.

45:41.661 --> 45:44.031
What? You didn't
know? He runs this army.

45:44.064 --> 45:45.232
Oh, no, I didn't know that.

45:45.265 --> 45:47.201
Anyway, you don't
understand, corporal,

45:47.234 --> 45:49.503
I really need that money or
else I can't do my little...

45:49.536 --> 45:50.705
Can't what?

45:50.738 --> 45:52.739
Well like... Oh
it's not important.

45:52.772 --> 45:55.509
Listen, I just really,
really need the money.

45:55.542 --> 45:57.010
Hands are tied, Fixer.

45:57.044 --> 45:58.145
Can't go against the King.

45:58.178 --> 45:59.613
I will pay you
tomorrow for two days,

45:59.647 --> 46:01.049
but today it's impossible.

46:03.384 --> 46:04.386
Sorry.

46:06.654 --> 46:08.156
OK.

46:08.189 --> 46:11.460
I know
this is for the best.

46:16.497 --> 46:17.332
Ah.

46:46.359 --> 46:47.694
Hey! So how's
the new job goin'?

46:47.727 --> 46:49.062
Oh, good now.

46:49.096 --> 46:50.498
It was a little
hairy for a second.

46:50.531 --> 46:52.200
The King, he suspended
all salaries.

46:52.232 --> 46:55.504
I wasn't sure I was gonna get
the money to make a feast.

46:57.471 --> 46:58.806
Well?

46:58.839 --> 47:00.007
Well what?

47:00.040 --> 47:02.309
Well, how did you get
the money, damn you?

47:02.343 --> 47:04.111
I mean,
I'm just curious.

47:05.645 --> 47:06.714
You!

47:06.747 --> 47:08.882
I pawned my gun.

47:08.915 --> 47:09.984
How much for the gun?

47:11.852 --> 47:12.654
Eh,

47:13.721 --> 47:14.822
$40.

47:14.855 --> 47:15.757
Deal.

47:15.790 --> 47:16.958
Yeah, so when I get paid today,

47:16.991 --> 47:19.227
I'll redeem the gun
and put it back.

47:21.094 --> 47:22.163
How much for this?

47:23.797 --> 47:25.100
Two bucks.

47:27.902 --> 47:29.504
No one will know
the difference.

47:29.536 --> 47:32.406
Like I said, I can fix
anything, I tell ya'.

47:32.439 --> 47:34.274
The King will
never know a thing.

47:34.308 --> 47:35.544
That's wonderful.

47:40.580 --> 47:42.550
I have an enemy prisoner.

47:44.018 --> 47:46.754
He killed 20 of our
men in cold blood.

47:46.786 --> 47:48.022
The government wants him dead,

47:48.055 --> 47:49.890
but they don't want
to do it themselves.

47:49.924 --> 47:52.427
Call that Fixer
guy you recruited.

47:52.460 --> 47:53.228
To kill a man?

47:53.261 --> 47:54.295
You have a problem with that?

47:54.328 --> 47:55.029
Yes, sir.

47:55.062 --> 47:56.230
I mean, no, sir.

47:56.263 --> 48:00.300
Anyway, the idiot
pawned his gun.

48:00.334 --> 48:01.803
He's carryin' around a fake.

48:01.835 --> 48:04.038
He has the gall to think
he could get away with it.

48:04.071 --> 48:05.573
Ha!

48:05.605 --> 48:08.276
Let's see him get
himself out of this one.

48:09.442 --> 48:11.511
Roberto!

48:11.544 --> 48:14.781
Get me my cappuccino, pronto.

48:41.575 --> 48:45.413
You summoned me, Mr. Renquist?

48:45.446 --> 48:47.815
Yes, execute that
man over there.

48:47.848 --> 48:49.484
He's a vicious criminal.

48:49.517 --> 48:51.886
A terrible, frightening
monster of a man.

48:51.919 --> 48:55.022
He's a threat to society
and to all of mankind.

48:57.924 --> 49:01.161
Oh, but I've never
killed anyone before.

49:01.194 --> 49:02.529
Well, it's a
perfect time to start.

49:02.562 --> 49:04.097
Please, you have to get
someone else to do it.

49:04.131 --> 49:05.565
I gave you an order, private.

49:05.598 --> 49:07.401
You have a problem
following orders?

49:09.870 --> 49:11.873
Is his case really that clear?

49:13.341 --> 49:15.843
I mean what if his
case is not clear?

49:15.875 --> 49:16.843
What if he didn't do it?

49:16.877 --> 49:18.079
Maybe he didn't do it?

49:18.111 --> 49:19.446
What if he doesn't
deserve to die?

49:19.480 --> 49:22.050
The case
against him is certain.

49:22.082 --> 49:23.250
No doubt whatsoever.

49:23.283 --> 49:24.518
Execute him now.

49:35.529 --> 49:36.831
Ohhhhhh,

49:36.864 --> 49:38.333
_Uwaaaahhhhhhhh!

49:38.366 --> 49:39.567
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

49:39.600 --> 49:43.171
Wuaaaahhhhh!

49:43.203 --> 49:46.707
God almighty, never
in my entire life

49:46.741 --> 49:49.310
have I killed a
person, any person.

49:49.343 --> 49:54.214
If this man is innocent, I
mean really and truly innocent,

49:54.247 --> 49:55.982
I'm beggin' ya' God,

49:56.015 --> 49:59.953
you sweet, sweet God,

49:59.986 --> 50:02.623
let my gun not be a gun.

50:04.325 --> 50:08.763
Let it be a harmless and
completely useless toy.

50:27.114 --> 50:27.749
Thank you.

50:32.919 --> 50:34.088
Come here, Fixer.

50:36.223 --> 50:38.359
Go in peace, Fixer.

50:38.392 --> 50:39.694
Go in peace.

50:39.727 --> 50:42.230
Thank you so much,
thank you so much.

50:42.263 --> 50:44.766
And may I say, you
look so familiar.

50:45.665 --> 50:47.033
Hmmm.

50:47.067 --> 50:48.436
- Cut.
- That's it?

50:48.468 --> 50:49.903
It's late,
you need to sleep.

50:49.937 --> 50:50.772
But I don't get it.

50:50.805 --> 50:51.605
You don't get it?

50:51.638 --> 50:52.439
I don't get it.

50:52.473 --> 50:53.440
You don't get it.

50:53.473 --> 50:54.975
Tell you what,

50:55.009 --> 50:57.745
tomorrow I'll tell you the
other version of the story.

50:57.777 --> 50:59.013
There's
another version?

51:16.297 --> 51:18.833
Rebetzen Eliana,

51:18.866 --> 51:22.402
my dream continued last night.

51:22.435 --> 51:25.705
Julio Iglesias and I

51:25.739 --> 51:27.909
were having a baby.

51:27.942 --> 51:29.043
There I was

51:29.076 --> 51:33.448
giving birth in Yankee Stadium.

51:33.480 --> 51:36.350
Thousands of people watching me.

51:38.685 --> 51:42.155
Yan and I never
had kids, you know,

51:42.189 --> 51:44.257
but I always imagined

51:44.290 --> 51:47.694
that it would be more
painful than that.

51:48.895 --> 51:53.000
But of course, it
was just a dream.

51:53.933 --> 51:57.337
So that's makes no sense.

51:57.370 --> 51:58.638
Brenda, what are you dong?

51:58.672 --> 52:00.174
What do you mean?

52:00.207 --> 52:02.576
Rebetzen Eliana doesn't
speak a word of English.

52:03.877 --> 52:05.680
She only understands
Hebrew and French.

52:09.183 --> 52:10.651
How did you end
up coming here?

52:10.683 --> 52:13.187
Oh, I heard about it
when I was back at home.

52:13.219 --> 52:14.455
I was writing an article

52:14.488 --> 52:16.022
about the power of
prayer in healing.

52:16.056 --> 52:17.692
So you found a connection?

52:17.725 --> 52:21.496
Well, in the end, I figured
that if the soul is healed

52:21.529 --> 52:23.397
and doing what it
needs to be doing,

52:23.430 --> 52:25.600
the body just naturally follows.

52:25.632 --> 52:27.134
How do you heal your soul?

52:27.167 --> 52:28.402
I have no idea.

52:29.969 --> 52:32.105
But they call, Rebbe Nachman
the doctor of the soul.

52:32.138 --> 52:34.374
This is just so strange,
doctors of souls, fixers, kings,

52:34.408 --> 52:36.076
it can't get any
weirder than this.

52:36.109 --> 52:36.977
Ah!

52:37.944 --> 52:40.046
She doesn't look so good.

52:40.080 --> 52:41.616
You think?

52:41.649 --> 52:43.417
You said you had another
version of the story.

52:43.450 --> 52:45.919
Ah, yes.

52:51.959 --> 52:53.560
Wow, who's that?

52:54.495 --> 52:55.529
The King.

52:55.562 --> 52:56.597
The real king.

52:58.131 --> 52:59.666
This is his land.

53:00.801 --> 53:02.536
He does
seem different.

53:03.837 --> 53:06.507
I have everything.

53:06.540 --> 53:08.743
There can be no
one happier than I.

53:09.944 --> 53:12.714
Who can have fewer
worries than I have?

53:14.348 --> 53:17.183
Maybe I'll investigate.

53:19.919 --> 53:22.489
Louis, it's been four years,
the bakery isn't working.

53:22.522 --> 53:24.892
I'm tired of having
nothing to eat.

53:32.098 --> 53:33.500
Who'll take care of me

53:33.533 --> 53:36.069
when I can't walk anymore?

53:43.910 --> 53:45.378
What's gonna happen to her

53:45.411 --> 53:47.881
when I'm gone?

53:47.915 --> 53:50.051
Yeah, but this is just
like the other story.

53:50.084 --> 53:52.853
Yes and no, let's
just fast forward.

53:55.122 --> 53:56.924
How is he happy?

53:56.957 --> 53:59.093
His home is sunk
into the ground.

53:59.125 --> 53:59.960
He has nothing.

54:01.127 --> 54:03.363
He is behaving as if
he has everything.

54:03.397 --> 54:04.699
I must find out.

54:05.799 --> 54:06.901
Yes?

54:06.933 --> 54:08.969
Entree, door's quite open.

54:09.002 --> 54:12.839
Consider my home your home
from floor to ceiling.

54:12.872 --> 54:13.674
Wow,

54:14.507 --> 54:15.643
thanks.

54:38.131 --> 54:40.334
So it
is possible to have nothing

54:40.366 --> 54:42.135
yet be totally happy.

54:43.569 --> 54:46.539
But I wonder, can he keeps
this state of happiness

54:46.573 --> 54:49.310
when things are
not going his way?

54:53.714 --> 54:58.252
Let me see what happens
when I ruin this for him.

54:58.285 --> 55:00.687
The rest of the story
is pretty much the same.

55:02.689 --> 55:04.958
So what's the difference?

55:04.991 --> 55:08.294
So tell me, where did
you get all this stuff?

55:08.328 --> 55:09.363
Well, I'm a fixer.

55:09.395 --> 55:10.864
What do you think?

55:10.897 --> 55:14.701
Well, this king
doesn't seem like a bad king.

55:14.734 --> 55:17.837
If I hire you, I'll be
arrested, by king's orders.

55:17.870 --> 55:21.474
He just wants to see
what The Fixer is made of.

55:21.507 --> 55:24.745
Can he stay happy when
things are not going his way.

55:24.777 --> 55:25.913
Is that it?

55:25.946 --> 55:30.183
No, of all the places
the King could be,

55:30.216 --> 55:32.419
he goes out of his way
to eat with this guy

55:32.453 --> 55:33.320
and stay in his home.

55:33.352 --> 55:34.521
And why him?

55:34.555 --> 55:39.060
Is it because he's
happy no matter what?

55:39.093 --> 55:41.594
Wouldn't you prefer the
company of such a person?

55:41.627 --> 55:44.497
Yeah, but I have to tell ya'

55:44.531 --> 55:46.100
that's a very hard
level to be at,

55:46.132 --> 55:48.902
don't you ever just
wake up in a bad mood,

55:48.935 --> 55:51.238
or sometimes a person
has real problems,

55:51.270 --> 55:52.539
sickness, poverty, pain.

55:52.573 --> 55:54.475
Are we not supposed
to feel anything,

55:54.507 --> 55:55.810
become a society of robots

55:55.843 --> 55:57.478
putting a pretend
smile on our face

55:57.511 --> 55:59.779
while actually screaming inside?

55:59.812 --> 56:02.482
This is the part
of the story you never saw.

56:02.515 --> 56:03.517
Watch again.

56:05.886 --> 56:06.954
We're going in?

56:07.921 --> 56:09.656
We're going in.

56:09.689 --> 56:10.724
We're going in.

56:11.892 --> 56:13.527
What's he doing?

56:17.797 --> 56:21.902
You said sometimes
you just want to scream.

56:24.270 --> 56:25.238
So scream!

56:25.272 --> 56:26.640
Ahhh!

56:26.672 --> 56:27.475
Yell!

56:27.507 --> 56:28.308
Ahhh!

56:30.009 --> 56:32.379
- I can do that?
- Of course.

56:32.411 --> 56:34.647
God, help me!

56:34.681 --> 56:36.117
I don't know what to do.

56:36.149 --> 56:37.317
Ah!

56:37.350 --> 56:38.618
What do You want me to do?

56:38.652 --> 56:39.820
I don't know what to do.

56:39.852 --> 56:41.421
Ah!

56:41.455 --> 56:43.056
I need to make a living.

56:43.089 --> 56:44.725
I can't take it anymore.

56:44.757 --> 56:46.227
Ah!

56:46.259 --> 56:47.962
I'm willing to do anything.

56:48.828 --> 56:50.830
Just help me.

56:50.864 --> 56:54.468
A person's screams
can carry their prayers

56:54.500 --> 56:56.403
to the highest places.

56:57.870 --> 56:59.839
God, I know this is from You.

56:59.872 --> 57:03.042
And I know this is for
the best, just guide me.

57:03.076 --> 57:05.880
A broken heart
is very precious.

57:05.913 --> 57:07.815
Help me trust in only You.

57:07.848 --> 57:09.283
Give me faith.

57:09.315 --> 57:12.752
Talk to God every day.

57:12.785 --> 57:15.054
For at least an hour.

57:15.087 --> 57:18.959
Be yourself with Him,
tell Him everything.

57:20.893 --> 57:22.062
So that's how

57:22.094 --> 57:23.430
he stayed happy
despite everything.

57:23.462 --> 57:25.365
I thought he was
super-human or something.

57:29.803 --> 57:31.705
Rebecca!

57:31.738 --> 57:32.573
Rebecca!

57:35.741 --> 57:37.844
I thought you were...

57:37.877 --> 57:39.712
Didn't I have a pulse?

57:39.745 --> 57:40.714
No.

57:41.848 --> 57:44.184
Sorry, was I supposed
to check for that?

57:48.654 --> 57:50.957
I think so, yeah.

57:50.991 --> 57:53.360
I woulda checked for that.

57:56.363 --> 57:57.931
What happened to you?

57:57.964 --> 57:58.999
Nothing.

58:01.602 --> 58:03.937
So what made you come here?

58:05.105 --> 58:08.642
Forgive me,
super-invasive question.

58:08.674 --> 58:11.411
Of course you're here for
the same reason I'm here,

58:11.444 --> 58:14.381
but you shouldn't
have any problems.

58:14.413 --> 58:17.584
I mean, look at you.

58:17.618 --> 58:19.152
That's what everyone says.

58:19.185 --> 58:20.888
Barbara, we can't figure it out.

58:20.921 --> 58:22.355
You have everything.

58:22.388 --> 58:24.959
Looks, personality, you
dress like a million bucks,

58:24.991 --> 58:26.893
you actually have
a million bucks.

58:26.926 --> 58:28.228
Why are you still single?

58:28.261 --> 58:29.863
Nope, no one ever
says that to me.

58:29.897 --> 58:33.267
Most people tell me I should
smile more and wear makeup.

58:33.299 --> 58:36.603
Someone even
mentioned liposuction.

58:36.636 --> 58:38.004
That was a joke, OK?

58:38.038 --> 58:40.474
Yeah, it was hilarious.

58:40.506 --> 58:41.741
I don't know what to say.

58:41.774 --> 58:43.543
I feel as if I have
to give them a reason

58:43.576 --> 58:45.111
even when I don't know why.

58:45.145 --> 58:46.780
I've been looking
for over seven years.

58:46.812 --> 58:49.015
One day you'll be
ecstatic to be on your own

58:49.049 --> 58:52.085
with no husband
to drag you down.

58:52.118 --> 58:56.890
Tom was more like another child
to me than a real partner.

58:56.924 --> 59:01.062
Brenda, you never
said, why did you come?

59:02.930 --> 59:04.498
I have cancer.

59:13.506 --> 59:17.744
So how do you talk to God?

59:19.712 --> 59:22.415
It can be stream
of consciousness

59:23.817 --> 59:28.689
or if you want structure you
can divide up your conversation

59:28.721 --> 59:30.524
into three parts.

59:31.457 --> 59:32.526
First part,

59:33.627 --> 59:35.630
start with gratitude

59:36.863 --> 59:39.567
for the things that are
working in your life.

59:40.767 --> 59:42.402
For the things
you're happy about.

59:44.036 --> 59:45.872
Second part,

59:45.906 --> 59:48.709
tell God your problems

59:48.741 --> 59:51.312
as if to a close
friend or a therapist.

59:52.779 --> 59:55.516
Tell him everything
in your own words.

59:55.549 --> 59:57.618
Ask questions.

59:57.651 --> 59:59.386
Do you need to change something?

59:59.419 --> 1:00:01.121
To fix something?

1:00:01.154 --> 1:00:04.625
And then, the last part.

1:00:04.658 --> 1:00:06.926
Ask for help.

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:09.563
Ask for what you want.

1:00:10.730 --> 1:00:13.901
Ask, ask for everything

1:00:15.468 --> 1:00:19.272
you need and don't hold back.

1:00:21.607 --> 1:00:24.678
An idea, thank God

1:00:24.710 --> 1:00:26.446
for giving it to you

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:30.151
as if you already had it

1:00:31.551 --> 1:00:34.689
even if you don't have it yet.

1:00:35.622 --> 1:00:38.591
Everyone, pick a spot

1:00:39.759 --> 1:00:42.495
and spend an hour
talking to God.

1:00:48.234 --> 1:00:51.939
And remember, start
with gratitude.

1:00:53.939 --> 1:00:56.175
Thank you, God,
for my gorgeous eyes.

1:00:56.209 --> 1:00:57.777
Thank you, God,

1:01:00.346 --> 1:01:02.783
for my new teeth, implants.

1:01:02.815 --> 1:01:04.451
Thank you, God,
that my eyes look good

1:01:04.484 --> 1:01:06.520
with almost any
color eye shadow.

1:01:06.553 --> 1:01:10.623
That I can now chew hard food.

1:01:10.656 --> 1:01:13.727
Thank you, God, for that
amazing five course meal

1:01:13.759 --> 1:01:15.395
at the Waldorf on Sunday.

1:01:15.428 --> 1:01:16.829
Thank you for my new hip.

1:01:16.863 --> 1:01:20.466
Thank you, my son smiled
at me before I left.

1:01:20.500 --> 1:01:24.271
Thank you, God,
for my size 26 waist.

1:01:24.303 --> 1:01:26.339
I don't need a walker anymore.

1:01:26.372 --> 1:01:29.008
Thank you, God, for my
new leopard skin shoes

1:01:29.042 --> 1:01:30.944
and matching gold sequin belt.

1:01:30.977 --> 1:01:32.946
Thank you for

1:01:35.348 --> 1:01:37.451
letting me stay in the hospital

1:01:38.919 --> 1:01:42.723
longer, 'til they could
get me home health aide.

1:01:42.756 --> 1:01:45.225
Thank you, I didn't
forget my pills.

1:01:45.257 --> 1:01:47.727
Oh, and I almost forgot,

1:01:47.761 --> 1:01:49.730
thank you for my new Armani bag.

1:01:49.763 --> 1:01:53.734
I especially love the golden
clasp with a smiley face.

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:55.602
Hah.

1:01:56.870 --> 1:02:00.241
Well, I know there's
more gratitude stuff

1:02:01.174 --> 1:02:02.576
but I kinda need to talk.

1:02:04.243 --> 1:02:06.046
Despite everything I have, God.

1:02:06.078 --> 1:02:07.214
I'm just not happy.

1:02:07.247 --> 1:02:08.748
I'm just not happy.

1:02:08.781 --> 1:02:10.350
I'm just not happy.

1:02:10.382 --> 1:02:11.551
How could I be happy?

1:02:11.585 --> 1:02:14.021
I'm like the six
million dollar woman.

1:02:14.053 --> 1:02:15.888
Half my body's made of titanium.

1:02:15.922 --> 1:02:18.257
My hip, my knee,

1:02:18.290 --> 1:02:19.426
my teeth.

1:02:19.459 --> 1:02:20.560
How can I be happy?

1:02:20.593 --> 1:02:22.161
I'm on six different
medications,

1:02:22.194 --> 1:02:24.664
they all have 10
different side effects.

1:02:24.698 --> 1:02:26.065
I just got fired.

1:02:26.098 --> 1:02:27.167
What's next?

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:29.002
And my son hates me.

1:02:29.035 --> 1:02:31.337
How can I be happy?

1:02:31.370 --> 1:02:32.905
I can't find a man.

1:02:32.939 --> 1:02:34.174
All my friends are married

1:02:34.207 --> 1:02:36.877
and let's be real, God,

1:02:36.910 --> 1:02:39.846
my friends are great,
but I was the one

1:02:39.879 --> 1:02:41.948
who was supposed to
be married first.

1:02:41.982 --> 1:02:44.451
I mean, come on,
God, look at me.

1:02:44.484 --> 1:02:46.886
I just have a question, God.

1:02:46.919 --> 1:02:49.622
A simple question.

1:02:49.656 --> 1:02:50.958
What was the point?

1:02:50.991 --> 1:02:52.860
I can't find
anyone that I like.

1:02:52.893 --> 1:02:57.231
The two marriages,
Alan leaving me,

1:02:57.263 --> 1:03:00.267
my parents dying, meeting Yan,

1:03:00.299 --> 1:03:02.135
then him dying too.

1:03:02.169 --> 1:03:04.471
All the guys that like
me, all they care about is

1:03:04.504 --> 1:03:07.207
money, cars and clothes.

1:03:07.239 --> 1:03:12.212
They are so superficial, so
arrogant, so full of themselves.

1:03:13.113 --> 1:03:15.582
Taking care of everyone.

1:03:15.614 --> 1:03:17.850
Just to watch them die.

1:03:17.884 --> 1:03:19.186
I don't want that.

1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:21.155
I'm not like that.

1:03:21.187 --> 1:03:23.756
My meaningless job.

1:03:25.158 --> 1:03:25.993
Am I?

1:03:27.527 --> 1:03:28.929
Am I like that?

1:03:28.962 --> 1:03:31.065
What am I supposed to say?

1:03:31.964 --> 1:03:33.700
Thank you that I got fired?

1:03:34.768 --> 1:03:36.003
That I'm on speed dial

1:03:36.035 --> 1:03:38.671
with a psychiatrist
and a psychologist?

1:03:38.705 --> 1:03:41.975
I mean, Is it my fault
you've given me so much?

1:03:42.007 --> 1:03:45.078
OK, I know, I know, I'm not
living up to my full potential.

1:03:45.111 --> 1:03:48.015
I know I could be doing
more with myself, but what?

1:03:49.149 --> 1:03:53.053
I mean, right now,
all I do is eat, shop,

1:03:53.085 --> 1:03:57.056
work out and worry
about not being married.

1:03:57.089 --> 1:03:58.524
Maybe if I hadn't gotten fired

1:03:58.558 --> 1:04:00.994
I wouldn't have the time
now to just focus on myself

1:04:01.027 --> 1:04:03.197
instead of just
writing about it.

1:04:03.230 --> 1:04:04.064
Maybe

1:04:06.198 --> 1:04:07.767
I should embrace who I am.

1:04:07.801 --> 1:04:10.971
Still, how do you expect
me to believe in you

1:04:11.004 --> 1:04:13.507
when there's so much chaos
going on in the world?

1:04:13.540 --> 1:04:15.042
Should I embrace who I am?

1:04:16.475 --> 1:04:18.277
Can I embrace who I am?

1:04:18.310 --> 1:04:20.913
In my mind, with my
son and in my work.

1:04:20.946 --> 1:04:23.383
Can I embrace myself
just the way I am?

1:04:33.292 --> 1:04:35.328
If only I could
just feel you with me

1:04:35.361 --> 1:04:37.497
in the midst of all this chaos.

1:04:39.832 --> 1:04:42.602
God, that felt good.

1:04:44.136 --> 1:04:46.673
I can't remember the last time
someone hugged me like that.

1:04:50.977 --> 1:04:55.047
Maybe it's OK to love
clothes and fashion.

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:58.352
Maybe I should do
something with this.

1:04:58.384 --> 1:04:59.919
What do you think, God?

1:04:59.953 --> 1:05:02.656
I mean, maybe that's the
reason I'm still single.

1:05:02.689 --> 1:05:04.424
What was the point?

1:05:04.457 --> 1:05:09.462
Because now the doctors
are saying it's all over.

1:05:10.864 --> 1:05:14.602
And everything just passed like
some dull and painful dream

1:05:15.335 --> 1:05:17.070
I barely even noticed.

1:05:17.102 --> 1:05:20.106
I'm not ready to go yet.

1:05:20.140 --> 1:05:22.908
This can't be all there is.

1:05:22.942 --> 1:05:25.946
I still haven't
figured out who I am,

1:05:25.978 --> 1:05:29.616
what I'm supposed
to do with my life.

1:05:30.950 --> 1:05:35.756
I know I'm 65, but so what?

1:05:36.855 --> 1:05:39.825
Until I'm in the ground
I'm not giving up.

1:05:39.859 --> 1:05:43.930
So the question is, what
do you want from me?

1:05:43.962 --> 1:05:45.064
Hmm?

1:05:45.098 --> 1:05:48.235
Why am I here, huh?

1:05:48.268 --> 1:05:49.970
Why am I here?

1:05:51.971 --> 1:05:52.873
Why am I here?

1:05:53.973 --> 1:05:56.076
Why am I here?

1:06:01.948 --> 1:06:04.750
I read this beautiful
idea that every

1:06:04.783 --> 1:06:07.320
soul comes into this
earth with a special song

1:06:07.353 --> 1:06:09.323
that only it can sing.

1:06:09.355 --> 1:06:11.591
Can a person live their
whole life and never sing it

1:06:11.623 --> 1:06:15.863
or waste it trying to
sing someone else's song?

1:06:17.129 --> 1:06:21.033
♪ Is it any wonder ♪

1:06:21.067 --> 1:06:24.071
♪ You feel alone all the time? ♪

1:06:24.937 --> 1:06:26.372
The world is full of messages.

1:06:26.406 --> 1:06:29.276
Trim, lean,
abs in just minutes...

1:06:29.308 --> 1:06:30.477
Do
this and you'll be happy.

1:06:30.509 --> 1:06:32.111
Change that and
you'll be a success.

1:06:32.145 --> 1:06:34.047
Lose weight, be perfect.

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:37.151
Beautiful,
handmade jewelry.

1:06:38.183 --> 1:06:39.785
Accomplish.

1:06:39.819 --> 1:06:41.221
I love you.

1:06:43.056 --> 1:06:44.257
I love you.

1:06:44.290 --> 1:06:46.794
Make a lot of money
and you'll be happy.

1:06:49.129 --> 1:06:50.163
But I'm not.

1:06:50.196 --> 1:06:51.797
Ah!

1:06:51.830 --> 1:06:53.499
Wish I could be happy like that.

1:06:53.533 --> 1:06:54.567
Do you really?

1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:56.303
Of course, who wouldn't?

1:06:56.335 --> 1:06:58.437
- OK.
- Huh?

1:07:04.477 --> 1:07:06.513
I wish I could
be happy like that.

1:07:08.781 --> 1:07:10.783
Just think of the scuff marks.

1:07:17.189 --> 1:07:19.125
I gotta tell ya'
somethin', Fixer.

1:07:19.158 --> 1:07:22.261
You're probably the best friend.

1:07:22.294 --> 1:07:25.498
Actually, you're the only
friend that I have ever had.

1:07:25.531 --> 1:07:28.634
But I just don't understand why.

1:07:28.667 --> 1:07:30.202
Why all this?

1:07:30.236 --> 1:07:33.306
Why do you insist on doing
all of this every night?

1:07:33.339 --> 1:07:35.275
Why is it so important?

1:07:37.109 --> 1:07:38.745
I came here thinking
I'd get an answer,

1:07:38.777 --> 1:07:40.212
but I still don't know.

1:07:40.245 --> 1:07:42.749
Talk to God every day.

1:07:43.783 --> 1:07:46.051
For at least an hour.

1:07:46.085 --> 1:07:48.221
Be yourself with Him.

1:07:48.254 --> 1:07:50.089
Tell Him everything.

1:07:51.790 --> 1:07:54.393
But the rest of the time,

1:07:54.426 --> 1:07:56.962
the other 23 hours of the day,

1:07:56.995 --> 1:08:00.633
a person must enlist
all their strength

1:08:00.667 --> 1:08:03.370
to be joyful at all times.

1:08:03.402 --> 1:08:08.107
It's human nature to be drawn
to depression and sadness

1:08:08.140 --> 1:08:09.843
because of life's daily events.

1:08:09.875 --> 1:08:14.513
Believe me, everyone is
filled with suffering.

1:08:14.547 --> 1:08:16.884
No matter how it
looks on the outside.

1:08:17.884 --> 1:08:20.953
That is why you

1:08:20.987 --> 1:08:22.589
must force yourself

1:08:22.621 --> 1:08:25.959
to be joyous at all times.

1:08:27.594 --> 1:08:29.997
To make yourself happy

1:08:31.363 --> 1:08:32.299
in any way possible.

1:08:35.033 --> 1:08:36.769
Even with silliness

1:08:37.670 --> 1:08:38.806
if necessary.

1:08:40.739 --> 1:08:41.575
Ah!

1:08:43.408 --> 1:08:45.478
How does she look?

1:08:45.511 --> 1:08:47.046
Looks good to me.

1:08:53.952 --> 1:08:55.855
My life is unfolding.

1:08:55.889 --> 1:08:57.457
Whether I'm doing
it right or not,

1:08:57.489 --> 1:08:59.059
I don't want to waste it.

1:08:59.091 --> 1:09:00.960
If I could have faith
that You're with me

1:09:00.993 --> 1:09:03.729
in every decision, even
the seemingly wrong ones,

1:09:03.763 --> 1:09:07.768
then maybe my life would
be a life of meaning.

1:09:08.968 --> 1:09:10.336
She said,

1:09:14.706 --> 1:09:17.576
ask for what you want

1:09:17.609 --> 1:09:18.911
like

1:09:20.145 --> 1:09:21.982
you already have it.

1:09:23.148 --> 1:09:25.117
Thank you, God,

1:09:27.319 --> 1:09:28.589
for healing me.

1:09:36.028 --> 1:09:38.598
Thank you for
sending me my soulmate.

1:09:39.765 --> 1:09:43.603
Thank you for getting
me off all those meds.

1:09:45.071 --> 1:09:47.806
Maybe I'm here to find you,
in,

1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:49.176
in myself,

1:09:50.242 --> 1:09:52.545
in others,

1:09:55.148 --> 1:09:56.984
in everything around me

1:09:58.952 --> 1:10:02.088
then every moment

1:10:02.121 --> 1:10:05.025
would be my life's purpose.

1:10:05.058 --> 1:10:07.861
Every moment would be my song.

1:10:07.894 --> 1:10:09.830
Who are you?

1:10:15.367 --> 1:10:18.437
Every breath, every thought,

1:10:18.470 --> 1:10:21.073
every word,

1:10:21.107 --> 1:10:22.743
every movement,

1:10:24.943 --> 1:10:26.647
is that why I'm here?

1:10:27.947 --> 1:10:30.450
To find you in it?

1:10:31.584 --> 1:10:33.620
Why are we dancing?

1:10:33.653 --> 1:10:36.356
Maybe because
it makes you happy.

1:10:36.389 --> 1:10:40.060
Do you think that maybe
being happy is the thing

1:10:40.093 --> 1:10:43.430
that makes your prayers heard?

1:10:50.536 --> 1:10:54.674
So, do
you know why you're here yet?
