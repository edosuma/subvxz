<i>In your cruise division

00:04.463 --> 00:07.841
I believe my son was across
that operation.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.929
It seems that a number
of documents were signed out

00:12.012 --> 00:13.597
by a Gregory Hirsch.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.308
Is that someone known
to you, Mr. Wambsgans?

00:16.391 --> 00:17.309
Uh, no, no, sorry.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.894
‐No?
‐No, Tom?

00:19.394 --> 00:22.731
I need you to chase down
the Sovereign Wealth money.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.534
You guys have the muscle
to take us private?

00:24.566 --> 00:25.566
Yes.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.878
<i>Could you come to Turkey?
Pitch to me?</i>

00:26.902 --> 00:28.695

And, um,

00:28.779 --> 00:30.579

Where's Dave?

00:31.031 --> 00:32.698
You're the target
of another bid.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.784
<i>Isn't that a problem?</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:35.619
Not to make this all about us,

00:35.702 --> 00:38.664
but are they going to shoot us
at any point?

00:39.414 --> 00:42.084
You told me nothing
about you stepping aside.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.710
You broke something here.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.587
They have someone else
for a victim.

00:45.671 --> 00:46.964
Could we find out
what she wants?

00:47.589 --> 00:48.799
I'm not going in.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.842
I'm out.
I don't want to be part of this.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.261

Time for a blood sacrifice.

Raise your right hand.

this committee

Yes, if it is to be said.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.502
You can speak to us normally.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.548
Okay, no‐‐ Thank you, sir.

So, what do you think?

Me?

02:30.609 --> 02:33.820
If you added Karolina...

02:33.904 --> 02:37.616
that's a decent bundle
of leadership meat

02:37.699 --> 02:38.909
to feed the sharks.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.453
Slippery cunt.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.626
Oh... I've always got time
for my big shareholders.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.671
I'm on my way to see Datu

Uh... I'm a tough bastard,

23:51.180 --> 23:53.641
So... I hear, uh...

23:53.724 --> 23:56.810
- ‐private's off, right?
- Okay! Ready?

23:56.894 --> 23:58.204
Just didn't trust them
in the end.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.105
I can't explain why.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.441
'Cause you're a bit racist?

24:02.524 --> 24:05.319
I didn't think so, but there's
always that possibility.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.370
It's bad. It's very, very bad.

24:23.212 --> 24:26.256
Hey, Greg.
What are you drinking?

24:26.340 --> 24:30.260
Uh... This is... I'm not sure.
It's a‐‐ It's a rosé.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.637
It's not my favorite.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.931
Ooh, you got a favorite
champagne now.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.601
Well... you can't help noticing.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.437
It's fine. I'll drink it.
It's just not my favorite.

24:40.521 --> 24:44.400
Well, you better drink up,
brother, because...

24:44.483 --> 24:46.944
if you end up carrying the can
for cruises,

24:47.027 --> 24:49.655
you'll be back to drinking milk
from a saucer.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.824
We're going private.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.452
‐Deal's off.
‐What?

24:55.536 --> 24:57.496
There's gonna be a head
on a spike.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.173
Hey, Pa.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.385
Uh... A quick one, not a biggie.

25:11.885 --> 25:12.928
Um...

25:14.096 --> 25:17.808
I need some help on reviews.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.643
‐The play?
‐Yeah.

25:19.727 --> 25:22.813
Just a spritz of praise.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.481
Some poster toppings.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.942
<i>The Chronicle</i> or <i>The Herald,</i>
just, uh...

25:27.026 --> 25:28.944
could you lean a little bit?

25:29.028 --> 25:32.406
You know, something like‐‐
Not this, but something like,

25:32.489 --> 25:33.699
"Kill for a ticket,"

25:33.782 --> 25:35.826
or "The theatrical event
of the season."

25:35.909 --> 25:39.121
I do not like to lean
on my people.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.290
Oh, come on.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.459
I mean, you brought down
a Canadian government

25:43.542 --> 25:45.061
over grain subsidies,
you can't give me

25:45.085 --> 25:47.337
‐one fucking lousy review?
‐Hey. Hey, easy!

25:47.421 --> 25:51.341
I hear you jizzed 500K
on a fake Napoleon dick.

25:51.425 --> 25:55.596
That's irrelevant. Look, Pa,
I'm‐‐ I'm actually hurtin' here.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.730
It's a half a mil a week.
I've got Austerlitz,

25:58.766 --> 26:01.518
I've got my campaign,
and I'm not super liquid,

26:01.602 --> 26:03.062
so I'm just...

26:03.145 --> 26:05.397
I'm just wondering
if I could hit you for like...

26:06.482 --> 26:11.487
like, uh... a little 100 mil.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.822
‐A little 100 mil?
‐Yeah.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.201
Well, you know, maybe. Maybe.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.787
But you have to quit
your campaign.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.165
Wha‐‐ Pa, no.
I got a whole team.

26:23.248 --> 26:27.503
Just to financially indicate
sound judgment, good intentions.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.689
I'm floating policy, I got
feelers, I got the Conheads‐‐

26:29.713 --> 26:32.716
It's a horseshit pipe dream.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.802
Everybody thinks you're a joke.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.929
And you're
fucking embarrassing me.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.476
Right. Right.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.646
Thanks for your honesty.

26:45.729 --> 26:49.441
Pull the plug
and we'll get into it all.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.568
But now,
I got bigger fish to fry.

26:51.652 --> 26:54.988
- ‐Uh‐huh. Nice. Lovely.
- So, hey, uh, listen up.

26:55.072 --> 26:58.283
I just wanted to say there are
a lot of whispers going around,

26:58.367 --> 27:01.912
but I'm not going to make
an announcement tonight.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.582
I wanna do the best thing,
the most decent thing,

27:05.666 --> 27:08.585
so, uh, tomorrow,
we'll get into a discussion

27:08.669 --> 27:10.629
about our missteps and...

27:10.712 --> 27:16.927
how we can indicate how sorry
we are to the rest of the world.

27:17.010 --> 27:22.266
Okay?
We're all pals here. Right?

27:22.349 --> 27:25.269
So... tonight, drink up.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.355
And tomorrow,
we'll figure it out.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.357
Thank you. Thank you.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.279
So,
someone's getting shitcanned.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.989
Let's get the party started.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.623
So, Willa,

27:46.707 --> 27:48.375
‐how's the play going?
‐Fuck off!

27:51.044 --> 27:52.629
How are you feelin'?

27:52.713 --> 27:54.339
Sick, anxious.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.595
Why is he doing it like this
do you think?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.597
How do you mean?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.307
"We're all pals here."

28:03.390 --> 28:06.184
"Let's have a discussion."
Like he suddenly wants our views

28:06.268 --> 28:08.562
'cause he loves advice.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.480
‐He's running a show trial.
‐Mm‐hm.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.483
You get the whole politburo
to sign the death warrant,

28:13.567 --> 28:15.360
then all our hands are bathed
with blood.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.322
Aw, that's nice and lovely.

28:18.405 --> 28:22.075
Ooh, no reception. Death cruise?

28:24.745 --> 28:26.330
Who are you thinking?

28:26.413 --> 28:27.998
‐You know what?
‐What?

28:28.081 --> 28:29.249
Frank!

28:29.333 --> 28:30.584
I hear it's gonna be you.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.252
Yeah, screw you.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.089
- ‐What have you heard?
- I got a book going.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.674
Want to put a million
on yourself?

28:37.758 --> 28:38.998
I'll give you four‐to‐one odds.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.677

much sweeter.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.889
Okay, are we‐‐ What exactly
are we hearing here?

28:43.972 --> 28:45.641
I'm hearing Frank.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.142
‐Uh‐huh.
‐Yeah.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.745
What do you mean, "Uh‐huh"?
He's bullshitting.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.228
Well, it's plausible.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.606
It's plausible.
You're plausible.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.107
Hey, I didn't say I wasn't.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.919
No, you're actually
a prime candidate. Six‐to‐one.

28:55.943 --> 28:59.071
This‐‐ This‐‐ This is horrible.
Roman, we're real people.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.739
You are not.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.534
You claim to be real,
but look at ya. Look at ya!

29:04.618 --> 29:06.119
Oh, yeah.
‐Yeah.

Cool shades, bro.
‐Uh‐huh.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.292
‐or just a... Yeah.
‐All right. I'm coming.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.338
So.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.799
When were you gonna ask?

29:21.218 --> 29:25.806
Naomi? I‐‐ I did. I‐‐
I asked Kerry to send word to...

I like her, Dad.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.026
And, uh...

29:38.110 --> 29:41.279
thought it could be
a rough weekend and...

29:41.363 --> 29:43.240
I know there's history, but...

29:43.323 --> 29:44.825
I mean, she's‐‐ she's...

29:45.867 --> 29:47.703
kind of a good one for me, Dad.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.496
Right.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.916
I wasn't properly informed.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.837
And I'm just not sure
we have enough provisions.

‐For everything.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.556
Yeah, I know. She'll‐‐
She'll stay out of the way.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.767
I‐‐ I mean, she's great.
I mean...

30:10.851 --> 30:13.353
I just don't want you
fucked on drugs.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.315
And she's part of it. Isn't she?

30:24.531 --> 30:27.451
Should I... do the knock
and invite her up?

30:27.534 --> 30:29.494
Well, I...

30:29.578 --> 30:31.872

30:31.955 --> 30:33.457

‐Okay.

There is kind of...

Could she watch us?

31:14.164 --> 31:16.041
Uh... Yeah. She could‐‐

31:16.124 --> 31:17.876
‐She‐‐ She could watch us.
‐Yeah.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.921

31:32.390 --> 31:35.227
that I might‐‐ I might not
be able to...

31:35.811 --> 31:37.020
perform.

‐Because I can't‐‐ I don't know.
‐Oh, Tom, no.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.359

We could put her in the bathroom

31:48.615 --> 31:50.158
and she could look through
the keyhole.

isn't coming in,

35:54.235 --> 35:55.403
we need stability.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.405
Yeah, yeah. You may be right.

35:57.489 --> 36:02.619
I need one meaningful skull
to wave.

36:02.702 --> 36:07.040
If the shareholders' meeting
were tomorrow, we lose.

36:07.123 --> 36:10.293
I need to persuade
a couple of big figures.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.544
So...

36:12.671 --> 36:14.214
anyone like to say anything?

36:17.717 --> 36:19.928
I'll take care of whoever it is.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.847
No one will be forgotten.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.266
Well, I mean, I‐‐
If we're doing this,

36:25.350 --> 36:26.768
I don't want to spread shit
around.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.979
We're all loyal servants,
but, so, I‐‐ I only say

36:30.063 --> 36:33.483
without malice aforethought,
presumably general counsel

36:33.566 --> 36:36.486
is center of the web.
Sorry, Gerri. I like you.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.906
There is no one
more loyal than Gerri.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.827
Exactly. What about Frank?

36:43.910 --> 36:45.995
I mean, how come
Frank is even here today?

36:46.079 --> 36:47.789
‐Thank you.
‐You're welcome.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.999
I could see it. I'd take it.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.626
- ‐I make sense.
- Right?

36:51.710 --> 36:53.670
And after what he did to you,
the boardroom coup?

36:53.753 --> 36:57.549
- ‐Water under the bridge.
- Right. In which case...

36:57.632 --> 36:59.592
I guess, in a certain way,

36:59.676 --> 37:02.971
my‐‐ my... indiscretion
against the family,

37:03.930 --> 37:05.306
I would say objectively,

37:05.390 --> 37:08.727
makes me less
of a compelling sacrifice,

37:08.810 --> 37:14.274
is the only thing I would say.
Unlike... uh... for instance...

37:15.108 --> 37:16.776
a loyal servant like Karl.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.738
Uh‐huh. Uh... I‐‐

37:19.821 --> 37:21.531
‐Thank you, Frank, for that.
‐Mm‐hm.

37:21.614 --> 37:27.829
Uh... Well, my thing, I guess,
is that if, uh, Rhea is no more,

37:27.912 --> 37:30.707
sadly, uh,
we're back to having, uh‐‐

37:30.790 --> 37:34.043
we're back to Gerri
as named successor.

37:34.127 --> 37:37.547
So, that fattens her up
for the kill, so to speak.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.174
I guess everyone knew
I was always

37:39.257 --> 37:40.884
just a name on a piece of paper.
Right?

37:40.967 --> 37:43.011
Oh... I think you were
always more than that.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.847
I think that's exactly‐‐
‐And plus‐‐ well, hang on.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.558
Plus, you know,
the old copy book

37:48.641 --> 37:51.352
is a bit blotty.
Expense accounts,

37:51.436 --> 37:54.355
daughters first class
on the company coin.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.648
- ‐Right, Karl.
- Y‐‐ Yeah.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.233
"I just went
for the sports massage.

37:57.317 --> 37:58.711
I had no idea it was that sort
of establishment."

37:58.735 --> 37:59.778
- Okay.
- Karl sounds good.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.279
Mm‐hm.
‐Sausage thief.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.782
You know, Gerri is theoretically
kind of perfect.

38:03.865 --> 38:04.949
Hear, hear.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.868
Uh... No, "theoretically."

38:06.951 --> 38:08.745
No, that's bullshit. I disagree.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.497
- ‐No.
- Why?

38:10.580 --> 38:14.083
Why do I disagree?
Because that's my opinion.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.419
Yeah, but your reasoning?

38:16.503 --> 38:19.339
Seriously, Gerri?
To pay for cruises?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.090
We‐‐ We take out a senior woman?

38:21.174 --> 38:22.425
Haven't we, you know,

38:22.509 --> 38:24.844
kidding here,
killed enough women already?

38:24.928 --> 38:26.805
I mean, I think
the obvious choice is,

38:26.888 --> 38:29.933
and I hate to say it
because he's such a swell guy,

38:30.016 --> 38:31.810
is...

38:32.393 --> 38:33.686
Tom.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.438
Excuse me?
‐Yeah.

38:35.522 --> 38:38.399
Right? I know, but you know,
head of cruises.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.401
But I‐‐ Well...

38:40.485 --> 38:43.071
‐I have been a loyal servant.
‐Yeah, but,

38:43.154 --> 38:46.282
you know, if‐‐ If this is, uh...

38:46.366 --> 38:49.077
just laboratory time,
human emotions extracted,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.995
Tom, I fucking love you, dude,

38:51.079 --> 38:52.914
but you shat the bed
over Mo Lester.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.517
But I was sent in there
as the beating‐‐

38:54.541 --> 38:56.185
as the fucking beating man.
I took the beating.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.752
You got suckered in by Eavis.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.814
‐I answered the questions.
‐You don't answer the questions.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.023
You don't answer the questions.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.757
Okay, that's, like, rule one.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.884
I'm‐‐ I'm not beating up on you
here.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.845
I'm just saying,
he got a win off you

39:06.928 --> 39:09.806
and you're kind of the face
of this, and...

39:09.889 --> 39:12.308
I don't know.
Look, I'm saying this,

39:12.392 --> 39:14.936
but I don't believe it.
I'm just‐‐ I'm saying it,

39:15.019 --> 39:17.480
because this is the time
we're all saying things.

39:17.564 --> 39:21.526
Yeah, I think, uh, Tom works.
Just kind of a clarity, I think.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.611
- Yeah.
- You know.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.488
Anyone care to speak
to my qualities?

39:25.572 --> 39:27.866
‐No, Tom looks logical.
‐What?

39:27.949 --> 39:30.410
- ‐Cruises. Document destruction.
- What?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.036
I'm not saying
that it should be.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.497
I mean, I‐‐ I'm saying,
you're like family,

39:34.581 --> 39:38.334
which is good, but also not...
family, which is kinda good.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.271
Tom, it's the elephant
in the room, we can say that.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.398
No, we can't. There's no need
to say the elephant in the room.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.816
There are 15 other elephants
in the room.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.675
Tom, the testimony, you‐‐

39:45.758 --> 39:48.112
‐you kind of put a target
on yourself.
Why shouldn't it be you?

39:48.136 --> 39:49.989
‐lf it should be me, why‐‐
why shouldn't it be you?
I've never even been in‐‐

39:50.013 --> 39:51.639
I'm not attacking you,
I'm defending you.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.284
Well, it doesn't feel like that.
It doesn't feel like that.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.475
Okay. Fine. How do I work?

39:54.559 --> 39:55.894
I don't know! I don't know.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.646
I'm just‐‐ I'm not saying you.
I'm just saying.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.815
I mean, I guess
if we were saying Shiv,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.026
we'd highlight witness tampering
and, uh,

40:03.109 --> 40:05.612
you know, that she was
gonna take over, but...

40:05.695 --> 40:07.756
I don't know, it probably‐‐
it probably doesn't work.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.616
Uh... Yeah. Too right
it doesn't fucking work.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.218
I don't make sense.
I've never been inside.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.661
What about both of them?
Shiv and Tom.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.330
Beauty and the beast.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.165
Does Tom work?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.420
Honestly, Tom...

40:22.503 --> 40:26.215
I don't think he's
a big enough skull. No offense.

40:26.299 --> 40:30.637
Then how about Tom with some
fucking Greg sprinkles?

40:30.720 --> 40:32.388
What? Greg sprinkles?

40:32.472 --> 40:34.474
Yeah, just a party pack.
You as a sweetener.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.892
Yeah. Yeah.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.019
Elmo and Big Bird,
I could start to see that.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.647
‐And then you throw in, like,
a Karl, or a Frank, or a Ray.
Okay.

40:40.730 --> 40:43.191
‐
‐Yeah, yeah. No, no. Why not?

40:43.274 --> 40:44.400
Oh, these are just examples.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.569
No, of course.
Yeah, no, just go ahead,

40:46.653 --> 40:48.780
‐worked for you for 23 years.
‐What‐‐ What precisely

40:48.863 --> 40:51.240
- ‐are Greg sprinkles?
- Greg sprinkles

40:51.324 --> 40:54.160
are basically
a fantastic garnish

40:54.243 --> 40:56.496
to basically anyone seated
at this table.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.123
‐Okay.
‐Like a Tom sundae with a‐‐

40:59.207 --> 41:00.750
with a little Greg cherry
on top.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.669
- ‐ Perfect.
- Oh. No, I object.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.171
I really do. I‐‐ I mean...

41:05.254 --> 41:07.256
Who cares?
‐I'm more than a sprinkle.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.133
You know? What about you?

41:09.217 --> 41:10.551
‐What about Roman?
‐What about me?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.011
Let's hear it. What's the pitch?

41:12.095 --> 41:14.263
You're widely known
as a horrible person.

41:14.347 --> 41:15.682
Thanks, toe jam,
why don't you...

41:15.765 --> 41:16.849
It could be Roman.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.810
There's another elephant
in the room.

41:18.893 --> 41:21.104
But what about I just
throw myself over the side?

41:21.187 --> 41:23.564
- ‐Huh?
- Didn't see that coming.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.692
Yeah, in return
for a little payout.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.443
I'm cash strapped,
so just strap me

41:27.527 --> 41:29.529
into that sweet, sweet
golden parachute

41:29.612 --> 41:30.947
and toss me in the volcano.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.116
Uh... I'm sorry. I just don't‐‐
I don't see that.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.619
Like, look, okay, you say,
you know, <i>eminence grise.</i>

41:36.703 --> 41:39.038
‐What?
‐So, uh, old Richelieu here,

41:39.122 --> 41:40.957
uh, skulking around
in the background,

41:41.040 --> 41:44.585
pulling the strings
all these years. Who knew?

41:44.669 --> 41:47.380
The maligned influencer
finally rid of.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.926
That's, um, that's kind of you,
Con.

41:52.010 --> 41:56.055
Thank you. And, uh...
we'll bear it in mind.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.768
Yeah, so I, uh...

42:01.978 --> 42:03.688
I need to reflect.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.898
I mean, we've, uh...

42:07.275 --> 42:10.194
half an idea, but, uh... Yeah.

42:11.487 --> 42:12.572
Later?

42:21.456 --> 42:24.459
What's‐‐ What? We have half
an idea? What's a half an idea?

42:40.850 --> 42:43.102
‐Ken. Can I get one word?
‐Yeah, sure.

42:43.186 --> 42:46.981
♪ ♪

42:48.191 --> 42:50.401
‐♪ ♪
‐

42:50.485 --> 42:52.612
What's up?

42:53.946 --> 42:55.865
Are we okay?

42:55.948 --> 42:58.326
I told her she was welcome,
but, uh...

42:58.409 --> 43:00.828
‐she's on a hair trigger.
‐Oh. Yeah, I don't know.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.080
She, um...

43:03.122 --> 43:05.917
She just... I don't know.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.296
Is Stewy available?

43:12.799 --> 43:14.133
Okay, um...

43:15.259 --> 43:18.805
I think so. He's on Paxos. Yeah.

43:20.431 --> 43:23.601
It might be... humiliating.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.562
Yeah, sure.

43:26.646 --> 43:29.148
But what I ought to do,
I don't wanna do.

43:40.409 --> 43:41.911
No, not this one.
I don't like it.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.722
You don't like it?
What's wrong with this one?

43:43.746 --> 43:46.415
- I can see a sea urchin.
- Oh, come on! Tom!

43:46.499 --> 43:48.501
Next cove, please, Julius.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.129
There are infinite coves.
Let's find the perfect one.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.312
Thanks for meeting, man.

44:08.396 --> 44:09.730
Please. Please, please, please,

44:09.814 --> 44:10.982
come, come, come, sir.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.376
How are you, sir?
Please, take a seat.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.484
You guys need anything?

44:13.568 --> 44:15.111
Yeah, don't wait for us
or anything.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.612
I waited,
but I was really hungry.

44:16.696 --> 44:18.090
You guys good?
You guys need anything?

44:18.114 --> 44:19.323
Uh... Maybe in a minute.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.201
Well, uh... look.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.620
We both know...

44:24.704 --> 44:26.164
it's a‐‐ it's a knife's edge.

44:26.247 --> 44:27.915
You may have it. We may have it.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.793
Our proxy advisors tell us
we probably have it.

44:30.877 --> 44:32.879
‐Mm‐hm.
‐And, um...

44:33.546 --> 44:34.672
Dad?

44:34.755 --> 44:36.549
You look a little sweaty, dude.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.301
Okay. Okay.

44:38.384 --> 44:40.469
So, I've come to make a deal.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.889
This isn't a negotiation.
It's a one‐bang,

44:42.972 --> 44:45.641
final‐deal offer
and it's generous.

44:45.725 --> 44:48.519
So... don't insult me
with a counter.

44:49.437 --> 44:52.773
I say this, we eat some octopi,

44:52.857 --> 44:54.650
we shake hands. Okay?

44:54.734 --> 44:56.611
Okay, I love that. I really do.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.822
Three board seats,
including Ken's.

44:59.906 --> 45:01.741
You get a codified say

45:01.824 --> 45:04.243
in the appointment
of our next CEO.

45:04.327 --> 45:06.287
We remove our poison pill,

45:06.370 --> 45:09.790
conduct a strategic review
on terms co‐set with you,

45:09.874 --> 45:14.170
dismiss all our litigation
on the proxy battle.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.881
Spin off cruises. Okay?

45:24.764 --> 45:26.307
No, I don't think that works.

45:28.768 --> 45:30.686
The fuck do you mean?
‐Bullshit.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.521
Are you fucking stupid?

45:32.605 --> 45:34.440
You have to consider that.

45:34.523 --> 45:36.150
You have to ask Sandy.

45:36.234 --> 45:42.198
‐That is a good fucking deal.
‐lt does not work for us, sir.

45:42.281 --> 45:46.118
Dude. I mean, are‐‐
are you fucking for real?

45:46.202 --> 45:48.996
I mean, you‐‐ you need
to fucking make it work.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.416
Okay? Or I will personally
fucking destroy you.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.002
- ‐I will come to you at night...
- Ken, it does not work

45:55.086 --> 45:56.396
‐for u‐‐
‐...with a fucking razor blade

45:56.420 --> 45:57.546
and I will cut

45:57.630 --> 45:59.382
‐your fucking dick off.
‐Fucking dick off.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.276
And I will feed it‐‐

at the firm

He had a twisted sense
of loyalty to bad actors

millions of dollars
in settlements

without his explicit approval...

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:15.049
