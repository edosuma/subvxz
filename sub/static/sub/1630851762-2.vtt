- Ah! Girl, you are early.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.795
Oh, girl.
I had to get
out the house.

Thank you.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.683
- Tort puns be funny.
- I aim to please.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.685
Oh, all right.
Look, before we close out,

01:42.769 --> 01:45.021
I need help spearheading
the rebranding presentation

01:45.104 --> 01:47.565

02:13.466 --> 02:15.885

I'm so glad
to hear that.

That's crazy. What?

02:34.946 --> 02:37.323
- Girl, I'm tired.
- Mmm.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.992
I think I'm gonna go lay down.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.163
- You got me my own pillow?
- Yeah.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.456
If you're gon' keep

02:45.540 --> 02:46.708
I want you
to be comfortable.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.625
Aww.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.503
Also, your head
kept deflatin' mine.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.921
You couldn't just
do a nice thing?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.427
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.387
Goodnight.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.141
You're my best friend...

So, we want it
to be just like

03:15.737 --> 03:16.905
that last event
you did here.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.114
Oh, the coding workshop.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.408
So you all want iPads
and loose cables everywhere?

03:20.491 --> 03:22.368
Nah, I mean, there
were a bunch of people.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.661
That's what we want.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.079
But not too
many people

03:25.163 --> 03:27.498
because we already got
a whole bunch of RSVPs.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.083
Oh, well, about that...

03:29.167 --> 03:31.711
Are y'all sold on havin'
the one-year here?

03:31.794 --> 03:33.338
'Cause you could get
more bang for your buck

03:33.421 --> 03:35.298
in a bigger,
more open location.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.176
Hey, I got a hookup
at a car wash parkin' lot.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.637
You just gotta
work one shift.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.513
Y'all still talkin'
'bout this party?

03:42.597 --> 03:44.098
Aric, your client is hot.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.308
Okay? He been waitin',

03:45.391 --> 03:46.726
his wife just went into labor,

03:46.809 --> 03:47.977
and he need to shape up
real quick.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.897
- So, what's up?
- Labor? That's what he's sayin'?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.273
Come do your job.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.277
So, about these locations,

03:56.361 --> 04:00.698
what you thinking,
'cause we gotta stay
within this budget.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.367
Uh, well, normally when
I'm working with a client,

04:02.450 --> 04:03.910
they make sure
that I'm well fed

04:03.993 --> 04:06.621
'cause my best ideas
require sustenance.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.374
Oh, well, I'm glad I'm not
one of them clients

04:09.457 --> 04:12.001
'cause, you know, you gotta
set your expectations lower.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.505
- Oh, okay. Cheap clients.
- Wow. Okay.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.135
You have
a lot of options.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.348
You can try
Ladera Park
or Hermosa Beach.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.226
Or the church on Adams
has a parking lot
that's super spacious.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.312
- Okay, you know this party
'bout to get unholy.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.939
But I could--
I could check out
the other two though.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.316
- Okay.
- How you feel about tomorrow?

04:35.400 --> 04:36.401
I feel good.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.070
It took like six months
of me wooin' Nadia,

04:39.153 --> 04:41.114
and then another
two months to convince

04:41.197 --> 04:42.156
the Nothing But Water team,

04:42.240 --> 04:45.952
but... it's all
finally happenin'.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.787
All right. I see you.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.748
- Entrepreneur shit.
- Entrepre-noire.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.629
Oh, they're tryin' to
set a mood up in here.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.381
It looks like it's working.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.637
- Damn.

05:07.306 --> 05:09.017
So what else do you
have goin' on tonight?

05:09.100 --> 05:13.396
Um, I got plans downtown later.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.857
Oh, those kinda plans?

05:19.694 --> 05:20.987
What about you?

05:21.070 --> 05:23.239
Hangin' with Molly.
It's freaky Friday,

05:23.322 --> 05:25.158
so we're gonna watch
"Any Given Sunday."

05:26.117 --> 05:27.910
That's what makes it so freaky.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.998
- Okay.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.299
Hey! So y'all can do
all this renovation work,

05:41.382 --> 05:44.260
and you still can't call
the estate planner that
I connected you with?

05:44.343 --> 05:47.388
See, we knew you
were gonna ask, so...

05:49.682 --> 05:51.684
There you go.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.564
Y'all wrote your will in pencil?

05:56.647 --> 05:58.566
Well, I had to erase
a few things because

05:58.649 --> 06:00.443
Jerome pissed me off.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.446
Mom, Dad, this limp,
loose leaf of paper

06:03.529 --> 06:05.490
does not qualify
as estate planning.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.492
You actually have
to go through lawyers--

06:07.575 --> 06:09.368
Hey, Molly.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.412
Hi.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.914
Molly, you
remember Herbert.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.541
You know,
Herbert from church, Herbert.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.670
Herbert, that became
a deacon at 15, Herbert?

06:19.754 --> 06:20.755
You remember.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.465
We were
at choir rehearsal,

06:22.548 --> 06:24.801
and I told him that
you two should connect.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.969
Herbert plays the organ
and you listen to music, so.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.932
Sometimes, I try to play
songs that the kids
can really connect to.

06:31.015 --> 06:34.352
I rework trap songs
for the Lord.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.647
What?
I'm just tryin' to get
you back in circulation.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.273
Okay. So, Mom,

06:39.357 --> 06:42.068
I'm really not pressed
to be dating right now.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.945
I'm actually just
focusing on me.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.780
Well, don't focus too long.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.783
I mean, you still gotta
meet a man, date him.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.993
That's two more years,
could be more.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.122
Then me and your Daddy gotta
save up for a big wedding.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.998
That's at least
two more years.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.250
Could be more.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.627
I mean, by the time
you're married,

06:59.710 --> 07:03.089
maybe, your Daddy could
roll ya down the aisle

07:03.172 --> 07:05.049
because he'll
be in a wheelchair.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.219
Because he'll be old, Molly.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.805
I'm just saying that,
in this situation,

07:10.888 --> 07:13.850
- I would rather--
- Hey, Molly.
Found one of the songs.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.768
<i>♪ Jesus gang, Jesus gang,
Jesus gang ♪</i>

07:15.852 --> 07:17.687
<i>♪ Jesus gang,
Jesus gang, Jesus gang ♪</i>

07:17.770 --> 07:19.939
<i>♪ Getting on the cross

07:20.022 --> 07:21.649

07:21.732 --> 07:23.442
<i>♪ Jesus gang, Jesus gang,

07:25.403 --> 07:27.905
And this is the framework
of Crenshawn's show

07:27.989 --> 07:32.702
as he highlights how he got
into fashion while incarcerated.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.954
As you can see,
Quoia is already rockin'

07:35.037 --> 07:36.706
one of Crenshawn's designs.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.001
You can take it
from day to night
with a blazer.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.711
I mean, it's day
right now,

07:41.794 --> 07:43.087
but it'll be night later.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.297
That makes sense.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.757
And Crenshawn actually
hires former inmates,

07:46.841 --> 07:48.384
so that they can
get the experience

07:48.467 --> 07:51.053
to find jobs
on the outside.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.388
Thank you.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.729
- Wow.
- Wow.

07:59.812 --> 08:00.938
Wow.
What you and Shawn

08:01.022 --> 08:02.273
have come up
with is incredible.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.567
And his story?
So inspiring.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.903
You really blew us away
like

08:06.986 --> 08:09.363
Thank you so much.
That means a lot.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.908
I'm so excited that
this is all finally
comin' together.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.492
Oh, agreed.
Agreed.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.204
Um, I'm-- I'm
a little concerned

08:16.287 --> 08:17.872
that this show
might be a bit

08:17.955 --> 08:20.333
big for Crenshawn's
level of experience.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.585
- What do you mean?
- Uh, well, it's pretty long,

08:22.668 --> 08:24.253
it's at the high end
of our budget,

08:24.337 --> 08:25.880
and I noticed
in the presentation,

08:25.963 --> 08:28.925
there's supposed to be,
um, a group of drummers,

08:29.008 --> 08:31.427
interpretive dancers,
uh, multimedia,

08:31.510 --> 08:34.263
and people
on lowrider bicycles?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.266
Yeah, I don't know
how you show perseverance
without lowriders.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.063
I mean, this is what
we talked about
from the beginning.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.522
Yeah, I know
it's last minute,

08:43.606 --> 08:45.650
but we have
some relationships
with a few artists

08:45.733 --> 08:47.693
that are on the same
vibe as Shawn...

08:47.777 --> 08:49.570
but they're a bit more...

08:49.654 --> 08:51.113
established and experienced.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.325
Yeah, artists like
Blue Parrot,
Renaissance, Edikt.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.244
Yeah, I'm familiar,
but none of them

08:56.327 --> 08:58.329
are from the community,
like Crenshawn is.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.249
Yeah, well, um, there's
a lot of great options,

09:01.332 --> 09:03.459
so think about it.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.920
Great work.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.880

09:07.964 --> 09:10.549

09:15.846 --> 09:17.098
The week before
an event is always

09:17.181 --> 09:18.849
stressful, Nathan.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.184
You'll figure it out.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.560
You better
<i>Carpe</i> that <i>Diem,</i>

09:21.644 --> 09:23.145

09:23.229 --> 09:24.981
Nah, I don't know
what that means.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.357
All right, bye.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.943
- Hey!
- Hey!

09:29.026 --> 09:30.778
So you two are
actually friends?

09:30.861 --> 09:32.238
Girl, I could
never be friends

09:32.321 --> 09:33.739
with somebody whose
dick I've seen.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.617
We're helping
each other out.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.702
Plus, he seein' someone,

09:37.785 --> 09:39.704
and he probably got
a bevy of bitches.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.248
- How many bitches make a bevy?
- Seven.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.542
Then I bit my tongue
a bevy of times today.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.919
Oh, how did
the presentation go?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.587
I see you with your
power suit on.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.423
This that Takeover Teal.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.385
I mean, I killed it,
but now Seth is saying

09:54.468 --> 09:57.263
he doesn't think Crenshawn
has enough experience.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.681
They love saying that.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.182
But how's we gonna
get experience

10:00.266 --> 10:01.726
if we're never given
the opportunity?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.270
That is the same shit
I was goin' through
with The BLOCC.

10:04.353 --> 10:07.023
Like, at least with NBW,
I can point to something

10:07.106 --> 10:09.483
and say, "See? Experience."

10:09.567 --> 10:11.485
And now you've got
a bevy of experience.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.821
I don't know 'cause Seth
talkin' about replacin' him

10:13.904 --> 10:15.990
with other artists
who've been at it longer,

10:16.073 --> 10:18.826
and I'm just worried
the whole thing's
gonna turn out--

10:18.909 --> 10:21.662
- White-friendly?
- Yeah, that.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.040
Well, listen.
Every boss got a boss.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.708
So why don't you
just hit up Nadia?

10:27.084 --> 10:30.212
You smart and I think
she might be in town, too.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.922
- Great idea.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.883
Ahh, come on.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.719
My Mom needs
to stop with these
damn pictures.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.887
You talkin' 'bout Herbert?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.389
- Yes.
- He can't look that old.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.934
His Daddy cute. Show me him.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.604
I said, his Daddy cute.
Show me him, Molly.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.938
Show me him.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.525
<i>♪ So tell me ♪</i>

10:51.609 --> 10:53.402
<i>♪ Tell me why ♪</i>

10:54.445 --> 10:55.905
Okay.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.032
Mm! Ow!

10:59.700 --> 11:01.535
Oh, let's do it.
Damn.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.953
"Looking for serious partners.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.039
"Must be successful, fit,
one degree, two preferred,

11:05.122 --> 11:06.457
"with no kids,
and if you're not that,

11:06.540 --> 11:08.125
please swipe left."

11:08.209 --> 11:11.796
Damn, I was
doin' the most.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.801
What are you looking for?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.388
But I thought you
were feelin' Jared.

11:20.471 --> 11:24.517
I am, but, girl,
these League niggas
have been vetted,

11:24.600 --> 11:26.394
and Jared didn't
even go to college.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.812
So, what happened
with The League?

11:27.895 --> 11:29.605
Molly
<i>Girl, I'm over them niggas.</i>

11:29.688 --> 11:31.732
Like, they look good on paper,
but they on some bullshit.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.234
I've dated outside
my race before,

11:33.317 --> 11:34.944
but I know I wanna
end up with a Black man,

11:35.027 --> 11:37.655
so what is the point?

11:39.281 --> 11:40.991
Okay, um.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.830
Uh, dating me is like...

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
Oh, okay.
Well, you know,
I just wanted to know

11:49.208 --> 11:50.709
that you got home safely.
That's all.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.586
And don't take
this the wrong way,

11:52.670 --> 11:54.130
you really needed a win.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.881
Look, I'm tired.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.634
Molly, you literally
never let shit go.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.066
Oh my god.
This is so good.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.527
Yup. Nice big breakfast steak.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.405
Right?
Oh god, I love steak.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.407
So, I wanted to talk
about the event.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.952
There's something
I wanted to, um--
ooh, another steak?

12:25.035 --> 12:27.037
Who, uh--

12:27.121 --> 12:29.081
Hey!

12:29.165 --> 12:30.458
Hey.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.792
When you told me you
had some concerns

12:31.876 --> 12:33.711
about the direction
of the event,
I invited Seth,

12:33.794 --> 12:36.088
and figured we
could all get
on the same page.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.090
That was
a great idea.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.717
Yeah, that's why
you're you.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.344
And to be clear,
workin' with Seth
has been amazing.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.345
He's so smart.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.307
Whip-smart.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.642
Um, and I understand

12:48.726 --> 12:50.519
Seth's concerns
about Crenshawn

12:50.603 --> 12:52.396
having a lack
of experience,

12:52.480 --> 12:55.065
but no one else
has the authenticity
that he does.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.986
I get that... but this
just feels ambitious.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.488
We're a young company.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.989
The moves we make
now are important.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.825
If this doesn't go well,
it could cost us.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.827
But we orderin'
breakfast steaks?

13:06.911 --> 13:08.204
I'm not trying
to be difficult.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.539
This is a big deal for us.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.500
No-- it's a big deal
for me, too.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.586
And, I understand it's a risk,

13:15.669 --> 13:17.254
but...

13:17.338 --> 13:19.215
when this goes well,

13:19.298 --> 13:23.969
NBW gets to say that
they discovered Crenshawn.

13:35.606 --> 13:39.360
If we're gonna go with him,
we'll have some notes.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.946
Great!
Notes are my favorite.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.156
Thank you notes,
love notes,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.200
notebooks,
"The Notebook."

13:46.283 --> 13:49.328
Great movie, sad ending.
We have got to find a cure.

13:51.789 --> 13:52.957

13:58.754 --> 14:00.923
Aight, I ain't

14:01.006 --> 14:03.008
Tarik is eatin'
snacks on the job.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.639
Well, you can eat
snacks, too, bro.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.432
You a free man now.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.393
- Word.
- Aight.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.770
Can't be snack snitchin'.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.106
- You feel me.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.357
So, I met with the team...

14:18.440 --> 14:20.734
- Word.
-...and great news,
we're good to go.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.319
Oh, shit!

14:22.403 --> 14:23.529
- Word?
- Yeah.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.072
Yo, that's what's up!

14:25.155 --> 14:26.365
I knew you'd get
that shit done.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.075
- I appreciate that.
- No, thank you.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.493
- I'm really excited--
- I'm 'bout to change

14:29.577 --> 14:31.370
- the game
on these niggas, boy.
- Ahh.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.330
Yo,
I'm talkin' straight
flex mode, nigga.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.582
- Okay.
- Yo, you know that little art

14:34.665 --> 14:36.000
performance piece
I was talkin' about?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.251
- Uh-huh.
- We gotta dial that up

14:37.334 --> 14:38.294
a whole notch now.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.628
I'm finna go crazy.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.838
Absolutely.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.799
Uh, well, NBW did have
a couple of notes.

14:43.882 --> 14:44.717
Notes?

14:44.800 --> 14:45.968
What you mean "notes"?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.845
Well, they, um, they just

14:47.928 --> 14:50.389
requested to simplify
the show a bit.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.142
Simplify?
What you mean
by simplify?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.768
They think it's ambitious,

14:54.852 --> 14:57.104
but they just want
you to be successful.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.981
Huh.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.483
For example, they...

15:01.567 --> 15:03.902
want to cut the section
on perseverance.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.696
That's one of the dopest
parts of the show.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.072
Iss, I'm not
tryna cut that.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.575
I know, the lowriders.
I love them too.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.119
What else they sayin'?

15:12.202 --> 15:14.496
Mmm.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.123
You know, it's funny.
Earlier you had said

15:16.206 --> 15:18.584
you wanted to double down
on the performance element.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.961
They wanna lose that, too.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.881
Damn.
Maybe they not
seein' the vision.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.841
- This might not be the move.
- No!

15:25.924 --> 15:27.343
Crenshawn,
I gotta say
I still think

15:27.426 --> 15:29.345
this is a great
opportunity.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.514
And I still think
you're the perfect
person for the job.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.224
I know how good you are.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.185
And, honestly, takin'
a couple of notes

15:36.268 --> 15:37.686
is miles better than
the other artists

15:37.770 --> 15:38.896
they were tryin'
to bring into this.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.689
- Other artists?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.777
But-- but I talked
them out of that.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.446
Look, they-- they
love your vision,

15:47.529 --> 15:48.697
they love your passion,

15:48.781 --> 15:53.786
they just... wanna make
sure that it works.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.996
Maybe we just gotta
wait for somebody who
really get the vision.

15:56.080 --> 16:00.334
Notes are normal for where
we're at right now.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.253
Look, starting over
would be a waste

16:03.337 --> 16:07.049
of the six months
we spent tryin'
to get here.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.468
It's all part
of the game.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.387
And I'm just tryin'
to win with you.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.391
I was hype as fuck
about this shit, too.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.726
Me too.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.020
Fuck it.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.480
- Let's get it.
- Yes!

16:21.563 --> 16:23.440
We got this.
I got you.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.733
I won't let you down.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.151
Aight.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.698
Keenan?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.158
Just eat
the sandwich, nigga.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.580
- Carol <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Mom!

16:38.664 --> 16:41.166
<i>Oh, hey!
Baby, just a second.</i>

16:41.250 --> 16:44.086
I am making spaghetti squash.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.548
Now, did you know that
there's no spaghetti in it?

16:47.631 --> 16:48.924
Yeah.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.846
Hey, I, I just
wanted to apologize

16:53.929 --> 16:56.849
for bein' so hard on you
about the estate stuff.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.935
I know I can be

17:00.018 --> 17:03.564
<i>oh, too tight
about things, and so,</i>

17:03.647 --> 17:07.067
when I feel it,
I wanna address it.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.988
Well, you don't owe me a sorry.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.073
<i>I know you want
what's best for us.</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:18.245
I just have to push through
my fear... and do it.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.205
<i>No, I get it.</i>

17:20.289 --> 17:22.124
Believe me.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.460
That is not easy.

17:24.543 --> 17:28.964
Well, I'm gonna call
the estate planner tomorrow.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.718
And maybe you
can give Herbert a call.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.972
You know, I saw him when
we had beach day at the church.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.558
Jesus, be a thigh.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.143
Oh, I'm hangin' up, Mom.

17:45.856 --> 17:46.982
<i>♪ You gotta know
what you want ♪</i>

17:47.066 --> 17:48.484
<i>♪ You gotta push that line ♪</i>

17:48.567 --> 17:50.527
<i>♪ You gotta stay on your toes ♪</i>

17:50.611 --> 17:52.654
- Hey, girl!
- Hi--

17:52.738 --> 17:55.491
Uhh, bitch,
have you lost
your mind?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.951
Dasani?
We NBW gang now.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.161
Oh, my bad.
I ain't know.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.079
So we got colors,
is there a hand sign,

18:01.163 --> 18:02.372
is there a dance?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.335
So what do you think?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.837
Aw, girl.
I know you been
puttin' in work,

18:08.921 --> 18:11.256
but this... this is it!

18:11.340 --> 18:13.717
- This is amazing.
- Thank you, girl.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.345
Okay.
So, all the gift bags
are all set up.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.679
And Crenshawn
just arrived,

18:17.763 --> 18:19.515
so I'm gonna see
if he needs any
additional help.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.726
And god damn!
Why ex-cons
gotta be so fine?

18:22.810 --> 18:24.812
I mean, I knew,
but I didn't
know-know.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.105
I mean, lock me up
and send me to his jail.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.649
- Okay?
- Quoia, please.
Keep it cool.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.443
- Hi, Quoia.

18:31.527 --> 18:35.322
- Just checkin'.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.576
She still thinks I brought
a gun to the block party?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.745
I mean, you did.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.290
Mmm. Another
Issa Dee event.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.166
Time for an interview?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.835
Uh, yeah,
I don't have time.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.545
If you don't make time,
I'll have to do an exposé

18:49.628 --> 18:51.588
on what you're hiding here.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.552
The BLOCC
is super excited

18:56.635 --> 18:58.220
to be spotlighting
Crenshawn,

18:58.303 --> 18:59.721
a local
Black designer,

18:59.805 --> 19:01.390
who has such a pertinent
point of view

19:01.473 --> 19:03.392
on the flaws
in our prison system.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.643
Wow.
This is an event

19:04.726 --> 19:07.020
with an actual impact
on the community.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.356
I see you've been
taking my notes.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.527
Is there a problem?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.821
No, no, no. That's just
a special cheer

19:15.904 --> 19:18.031
that we do when everything's
going as it should be.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.700
- Yeah.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.076
- Ooh, look at you.
- Yeah.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.494
Yeah, okay.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.376
What's goin' on?

19:29.459 --> 19:31.420
It's about Crenshawn.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.427
- What the fuck?!
- I, I know.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.596
That's why I was
wavin' so crazy.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.772
Hey, Crenshawn.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.108
This looks like all
the stuff that we
cut from the show.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.234
What's up?

19:54.318 --> 19:56.528
It wasn't
feelin' right, so...

19:56.612 --> 19:58.071
put the pieces back in.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.448
But we're a team.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.657
Why would you do
that five minutes

20:00.741 --> 20:02.367
before the show
without tellin' me?

20:02.451 --> 20:03.577
'Cause...

20:03.660 --> 20:06.246
I knew you'd try and
talk me out of it, right?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.999
Yeah, you're damn right I would.
This is outta pocket.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.417
We have a brand
to answer to--

20:10.500 --> 20:12.002
Ay, nah, you got
a brand to answer to.

20:12.085 --> 20:15.380
Okay.
Maybe we should start
using "I" statements.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.133
Okay.
I feel like you're being
really unprofessional.

20:18.216 --> 20:21.428
And I feel like
your support for me
is just a bunch of talk.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.889
You can't support
me halfway, Issa.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.683
Do you have any idea
what I even had to do
to get you here?

20:26.767 --> 20:30.228
Now, you hear yourself?
You're not my savior, bro.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.898
Look, I was doin'
just fine without you.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.360
I refuse to be a sellout.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.945
- What're you tryin' to say?
- I'm not takin' notes

20:38.028 --> 20:39.363
from people who
want me to be like

20:39.446 --> 20:41.198
a bunch of wack artists
I don't respect.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.241
You said you love
my passion, right?

20:43.325 --> 20:44.910

Yeah, you didn't
take the notes.

22:37.272 --> 22:40.150
No, the-- um, I actually
did talk to Crenshawn,

22:40.233 --> 22:43.070
but he's an artist,
little bit of a loose cannon--

22:43.153 --> 22:47.115
Loose cannon?
Uh, he's more like a missile.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.368
That... blew me away.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.413
Wait, what?
Thank you, huh?

22:53.497 --> 22:56.208
Sometimes, when
you're starting out,
you can get so...

22:56.291 --> 22:59.044
nervous about everything
going right, and then...

22:59.127 --> 23:00.796
you meet people
like you and Crenshawn

23:00.879 --> 23:02.339
who trust their gut.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.382
Thanks for pushing us.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.885
Yeah, thank you.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.303
Well, I should get home.
I...

23:08.386 --> 23:10.472
had a very aggressive
massage the other day,

23:10.555 --> 23:12.682

23:12.766 --> 23:14.267
