00:07.300 --> 00:09.833
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero...

00:09.867 --> 00:12.467
Alaskans blaze a trail
into the wild.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.333
CHIP: It has to be ourselves
saving ourselves

00:14.367 --> 00:15.867
or all they're gonna do
is find a corpse.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.567
NARRATOR: Chip travels
the tundra to protect
his family.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.300
CHIP: Any way along this trail
we're within a day's walk

00:21.333 --> 00:23.000
of food and shelter.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.333
NARRATOR: Sue's contact with
the outside world
is threatened.

00:25.367 --> 00:26.433
SUE: Those wires come down,

00:26.467 --> 00:27.967
I can't communicate
to get help.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.067
NARRATOR: Andy struggles to
trap food on frozen ground.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.767
ANDY: I hate working
and not producing.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.267
NARRATOR: And Erik
loses control in
the Arctic wilderness.

00:59.533 --> 01:00.733
SUE: Awesome!

01:02.633 --> 01:04.233
Beautiful sunny day.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.933
The winter up here
on the north slope

01:06.967 --> 01:08.633
and in Kavik in particular,

01:08.667 --> 01:10.500
it is just one blizzard
after the other.

01:10.533 --> 01:14.300
It is absolutely relentless
and just beats you down.

01:14.333 --> 01:17.133
This is the break in the storm
I've been looking for.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.500
Uh, you know, it's a lull.

01:18.533 --> 01:20.633
This is the opportunity
I've got to clear out

01:20.667 --> 01:23.367
in between my rows
of trailers and in front.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.167
I'm making a nice, flat,
smooth, even patch of ground

01:27.200 --> 01:28.833
that I can move around on.

01:28.867 --> 01:30.533
Ermie can move around on
and safely get

01:30.567 --> 01:32.300
from place to place
without, you know,

01:32.333 --> 01:35.133
going up
and over the, uh, drifting.

01:35.167 --> 01:36.967
You can't see
what's behind them.

01:37.067 --> 01:39.933
You know, it gives, uh,
gives predators a place

01:39.967 --> 01:41.633
to hide and jump out
at you from.

01:41.667 --> 01:45.700
I'm just going into the, uh,
time of year
where the predators

01:45.733 --> 01:47.267
are much more active here.

01:47.300 --> 01:51.600
So clearing some of this snow
is my top priority.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.067
NARRATOR: Below freezing
conditions have forced Sue

01:54.100 --> 01:56.267
to heat her machinery
before use.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.067
Her primary snow clearing
vehicle, the Bobcat,

01:59.067 --> 02:00.867
is no exception.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.867
It is warmer in here
with the generator running.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.867
But what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna open the back door

02:05.900 --> 02:07.367
for a little bit more light
in here.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.967
I'm gonna get the heater,
the, uh, extension cord,

02:11.067 --> 02:12.067
plug it all in.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.567
Extension cord's glowing red,

02:13.600 --> 02:15.933
that means the power's
being delivered.

02:15.967 --> 02:17.367
I'll go get that tarp.

02:27.867 --> 02:30.733
This is by no means perfect.

02:30.767 --> 02:33.067
You know, what I'm trying
to do is...

02:33.067 --> 02:35.467
I want the battery warm,
I want the oil warm.

02:36.733 --> 02:39.200
It's cold, so I'm just trying
to create a little bubble

02:39.233 --> 02:44.833
of happiness for this heat
to collect and warm
everything up.

02:44.867 --> 02:46.067
But it's gonna take a while,

02:46.067 --> 02:47.533
that thing's been sitting
for months.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.067
While that's happening,
I can, uh,

02:51.167 --> 02:52.900
grab my shovel,

02:52.933 --> 02:55.333
start working on a couple
of the staircases.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.600
Something this deep,
this tall,

03:01.633 --> 03:03.333
this hard packed,
I'm probably...

03:03.367 --> 03:05.667
I'll get to where
I can free up the doorway,

03:05.700 --> 03:07.467
but then when I bring
the Bobcat through,

03:07.500 --> 03:10.367
I'll use the bucket
as much as I can.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.067
When you're living all
on your own in a remote,

03:13.100 --> 03:16.400
cold, mostly dark place
for a lot of the year,

03:16.433 --> 03:20.500
your body kicks into a whole
different gear of time.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.400
Everybody else seems to have
this 24-hour time clock.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.200
I don't pay attention
to the clock,

03:25.233 --> 03:26.900
I pay attention to my body.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.767
When I wake, when I eat,
when I sleep,

03:28.800 --> 03:31.167
it's got nothing to do with
is it light or is it dark.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.467
It's when it's,

03:32.500 --> 03:34.400
my body says it's right
to do it.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.433
I've done quite a bit
but the position

03:37.467 --> 03:39.467
of the sun's telling me
I need to get out there

03:39.500 --> 03:42.367
and check on the Bobcat,
see if I can crank that thing
over yet.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.233
We got a lot more chores to
do, so I better get to it.

03:47.633 --> 03:50.167
ANDY: Every day, you're
thinking about what
am I gonna do today

03:50.200 --> 03:52.700
and what can I do to prepare
to make that go easier?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.367
It's hard enough
to live out here,

03:55.400 --> 03:57.400
without making it harder
on yourself.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.100
Eight.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.100
I've got a lot
of muskrat activity out

04:11.133 --> 04:14.333
on the lake behind our place.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.067
I figured it would probably
be worthwhile

04:16.100 --> 04:17.633
to spend some time, go out,

04:17.667 --> 04:20.167
and see if I can't trap
some of the muskrats
that are out there,

04:20.200 --> 04:23.500
because, I really kind of
enjoy eating muskrats.

04:23.533 --> 04:25.800
It's kind of like
the veal of beaver

04:25.833 --> 04:27.233
and beaver's really good too.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.500
And I really like diversity
in my diet, so I set a trap,

04:30.533 --> 04:33.567
I set it down in the muskrat,
uh, push-up,

04:33.600 --> 04:35.233
which is basically
like a little house

04:35.267 --> 04:36.467
where they feed. (SNIFFS)

04:36.500 --> 04:38.067
Cut off part of the top
of the house

04:38.100 --> 04:40.333
so I can see down in
and attach

04:40.367 --> 04:42.400
it to this stick right here

04:42.433 --> 04:44.067
and then this stick
will make it

04:44.067 --> 04:46.933
so if the muskrat does go down
into the hole,

04:46.967 --> 04:48.300
he doesn't take my whole trap.

04:57.233 --> 04:59.800
Okay, out into
the Arctic wasteland.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.367
(DOGS BARKING)

05:11.800 --> 05:13.067
Let's go!

05:13.767 --> 05:14.800
Atta boys!

05:16.233 --> 05:17.633
Okay, let's go. Hup, hup.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.067
Living out here, we really

05:24.067 --> 05:25.767
don't live by the calendar
that much,

05:25.800 --> 05:27.233
we live by the seasons.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.733
You kind of
have to second guess

05:30.767 --> 05:33.333
what mother nature's
gonna throw at you every year.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.200
When the cold hits,
when the temperatures

05:38.233 --> 05:42.233
are well below zero,
it's pretty damn dangerous,

05:44.267 --> 05:46.333
because, once you get cold,
your body shuts down.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.933
If you're by yourself,
there's no 911 out here,

05:48.967 --> 05:50.533
there's nobody
to come save your ass.

05:51.633 --> 05:52.700
It's all over.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.333
Atta boys! Straight ahead.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.233
Atta boy. Good.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.133
Go over to this house,
this is a nice big one.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.600
Let's see what we've got.

06:09.067 --> 06:11.367
There's a lot of houses
out here this year.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.867
Way more than I've ever seen.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.500
Right now there's probably
well over 100 push ups

06:17.533 --> 06:18.633
out on the lake.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.600
The biggest thing
I'm up against right now

06:23.633 --> 06:25.800
is this transitioning
into the cold time

06:25.833 --> 06:27.267
of the year for me.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.600
Once they freeze up, that's it
for muskrat trapping,

06:29.633 --> 06:32.267
because the muskrats
can't come up into them.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.267
The important thing right now
is to get as many out

06:34.300 --> 06:36.267
as I can
before the cold weather

06:36.300 --> 06:39.467
closes these in
and the game's over
until springtime.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.867
So you can see,
there's all kinds
of vegetation here.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.800
Their breathing has created
a bunch of ice right here

06:44.833 --> 06:46.600
and that's also helping
to seal it

06:46.633 --> 06:47.800
so air can't come in

06:47.833 --> 06:51.333
and as it starts to freeze,
they bring more and more

06:51.367 --> 06:52.867
of this material up
and they keep packing

06:52.900 --> 06:55.433
it in there to create more
and more insulation.

06:55.467 --> 06:57.433
It's like putting
more insulation in your attic.

06:57.467 --> 06:59.567
So, can I get some
of these traps going

06:59.600 --> 07:02.433
and catch a few muskrats
before the really cold weather

07:02.467 --> 07:05.567
hits and they can no longer
keep up with the amount

07:05.600 --> 07:07.867
of insulation
that's needed there?

07:07.900 --> 07:10.133
So I'm hoping this will work.

07:10.167 --> 07:12.400
I'm just gonna as carefully
as I can,

07:12.433 --> 07:14.067
put this back over the hole

07:15.867 --> 07:18.533
and cover it back up
and hopefully insulate it

07:18.567 --> 07:20.100
as good as I can,

07:20.133 --> 07:21.733
so it doesn't
freeze up on them.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.067
Another big one over here.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.300
This looks like a pretty good
little spot.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.300
I think I'll get a set in here
and then hopefully

07:32.333 --> 07:34.467
I'll be lucky enough
to catch something.

07:35.967 --> 07:37.800
Fingers are getting cold.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.400
Put this pack overtop.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.400
Okay, you guys.
Come and get it.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.167
I've got a good system

07:51.200 --> 07:52.800
and I think
I'm gonna just go ahead

07:52.833 --> 07:56.967
and start popping in traps
in as many of these houses
as I can.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.667
Right there, good
job, Iceberg.

08:10.567 --> 08:13.100
I think there's almost
20 traps out,

08:13.133 --> 08:14.933
so I think my odds are
fairly good.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.367
Trapping's nothing but
a wait-and-see game.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.167
Set my last trap,
let them set overnight,

08:21.200 --> 08:23.300
come back tomorrow
and see if the muskrats

08:23.333 --> 08:26.433
have outsmarted me or
I've out smarted them.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.200
Let's go home.
Atta boys. Hup, hup.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.700
CHIP: Our way
of living requires money.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.200
And our way of making money
is to sell the stuff

08:39.233 --> 08:40.800
that we make from the things
we gather.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.333
You've got these divvied up?

09:02.367 --> 09:04.400
Just the, um, flap
of the cardboard,

09:04.433 --> 09:06.533
not the whole cardboard box.

09:06.567 --> 09:09.300
CHIP: Part of what we do here
is get ready for the winter.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.133
Part of getting ready for that
is we put caches in place.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.667
We put gasoline, we put food,
and a way to rest so that

09:15.700 --> 09:17.433
on any way along this trail,

09:17.467 --> 09:19.567
we're within a day's walk
of food,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.733
rest, and maybe
a little bit of shelter

09:21.767 --> 09:23.700
if we use a tarp
and make a tent.

09:23.733 --> 09:26.467
NARRATOR: The Hailstone family
spends the winter hunting,

09:26.500 --> 09:29.067
fishing, and trapping
across the Arctic.

09:29.067 --> 09:32.200
Planting emergency supplies
along their travel routes

09:32.233 --> 09:34.067
is crucial to their survival.

09:34.067 --> 09:36.300
Well, the main elements
of a cache are to have,

09:36.333 --> 09:38.900
number one,
the ability to eat something,

09:38.933 --> 09:40.500
fuel, fuel for the body.

09:40.533 --> 09:43.067
Then you need to have a form
of heat or a fire

09:43.100 --> 09:46.633
so we've got matches and a lot
of burnable stuff here.

09:46.667 --> 09:50.333
We are going to make a way
to melt water and basically

09:50.367 --> 09:51.800
have all the comforts
of camping.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.967
We don't really consider it
a survival situation,

09:54.067 --> 09:56.767
we consider it a "Well, I've
got to get home" situation.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.267
And what we do every time
is when we leave,
we're ready to stay the night.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.467
This is one of our backups,
people are other backups,

10:02.500 --> 10:05.367
but number one, it
has to be ourselves,
saving ourselves,

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
or all they're gonna do
is find a corpse.

10:12.733 --> 10:15.333
AGNES: Right now I'm heading
to go get some, uh, gas.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.233
That's the only thing left
that I have to get

10:17.267 --> 10:21.167
for our caches that me
and Chip are going to go set.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.500
Good afternoon Native Store,
this is Agnes Hailstone.

10:27.533 --> 10:31.200
I'm here to pick up
my 9.97 gallons gas.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.300
(WOMAN SPEAKING VIA SPEAKER)

10:33.333 --> 10:36.267
"Go ahead, it's ready"
she said.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.467
So this is where we come
to purchase our gas.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.133
When we gonna buy it
for cash money.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.100
It's kind of weird
getting gas here.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.900
Press the button,
and call the Native Store,

10:44.933 --> 10:48.200
and tell them how much gas
or stove oil you want.

10:48.233 --> 10:51.500
And then they'll either
tell you to go up to the store

10:51.533 --> 10:52.733
and go pay for it.

10:52.767 --> 10:56.500
Or if you're a local,
they'll let you, um,
just go up

10:56.533 --> 10:58.967
and pay for it
after you fill up.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.567
That's it. Now that I'm done
with getting all my gas
and spending all my money,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.333
I'm gonna go
back home to Chip.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.733
ERIK: If I come out my door
and I go east,

11:13.767 --> 11:16.067
I can go all the way
to the Atlantic Ocean.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.400
I come out my door
and I go west,

11:19.433 --> 11:21.267
I go all the way
to the Pacific Ocean.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.567
I have the biggest backyard
on earth.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.433
All right.

11:37.767 --> 11:40.200
I'm about ready
if you're about ready, Martha.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.967
We've got everything we need.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.833
Yeah, we'll be good
with one tank of gas
for a sled load.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.167
NARRATOR: Erik and Martha
Salitan rely on the land

11:48.200 --> 11:51.267
to provide them
with their means of survival.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.700
With temperatures dropping,
today they will head

11:53.733 --> 11:57.300
into the woods to gather one
of their most vital resources.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.567
ERIK: I went into winter
with very little firewood.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.067
I spent my whole fall
guiding hunters

12:02.067 --> 12:04.900
and I didn't have
very much firewood
coming into the winter.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.867
Then we didn't get any snow,
so it has been hard

12:06.900 --> 12:10.067
to get out and get any wood.
And it's been warm.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.333
The river hasn't been
very safe.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.733
It finally is enough snow
to get out here

12:13.767 --> 12:15.067
and get a little bit wood.

12:17.767 --> 12:19.233
MARTHA: That looks dead.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.200
What do you think?
It's a nice size.

12:24.233 --> 12:26.300
ERIK: Does it have any green
on it at all?

12:26.333 --> 12:29.067
That one's not green,
but it's little.

12:33.067 --> 12:37.267
This is a six-inch wood.
We'll get a few days wood
out of this.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.167
(ENGINE ROARING)

12:50.133 --> 12:52.500
MARTHA: A lot of people,
they'd rather have
things handed to them.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.500
Us, we'd rather go out
and do it ourselves.

12:54.533 --> 12:57.067
It's just the way that we are.
It's just our nature.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.567
ERIK: I don't think
I'm gonna be able

13:04.600 --> 13:06.767
to get all the wood
that I have out here
in this load.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.700
Try to load
a little bit more on,

13:08.733 --> 13:10.800
then head back to the house
with this load.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.767
MARTHA: Didn't lose a log.
It was awesome.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.267
ERIK: (CHUCKLES) How about
the chainsaw?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.733
MARTHA: No, didn't lose
the chainsaw either.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.733
-ERIK: Good.
-MARTHA: I think you
rode pretty well.

13:30.067 --> 13:32.067
ERIK: This load alone
was pretty good.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.567
I'm not gonna waste any time.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.100
You want to start
making some food

13:35.133 --> 13:37.200
and I'll run back by myself
and get the other load?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.600
-MARTHA: Sounds good.
-ERIK: All right.

13:50.333 --> 13:54.067
It's been a good day.
We're just gonna get in safe
with this last load.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.967
Got the heavy ones
out of the way.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.400
This light load
should be pretty easy going

13:59.433 --> 14:01.167
if we can just get up
this bank.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.133
So rock and roll.

14:22.233 --> 14:25.133
Last load of the night,
always when you get hurt.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.633
Get this

14:27.667 --> 14:30.567
flipped over before it stalls
out on me.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.767
-(BATTERY BEEPING)
-(ENGINE DYING)

14:35.600 --> 14:37.067
(ERIK SPEAKING)

14:39.133 --> 14:40.733
Pay the price...

14:40.767 --> 14:42.367
When you're out here in

14:42.400 --> 14:44.500
poor snow conditions
trying to,

14:46.433 --> 14:50.733
trying to haul wood
when there's not a good trail.

14:50.767 --> 14:54.300
The problem is if I don't
get flipped over quick,
it will be all flooded.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.133
My wife is a mile away
at the house.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.733
If I didn't show up
in 30 minutes,

15:02.767 --> 15:04.800
she'd come out
and look for me.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.300
Before I had my wife
and I lived out here alone

15:07.333 --> 15:10.067
and you come out
and get hurt like that,

15:10.067 --> 15:12.167
let's just say
I'm not that well-loved.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.833
The track's not connected.

15:22.867 --> 15:25.367
When I flipped the machine,
I kicked the track.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.767
So rather than
smoke the machine... (SNIFFS)

15:28.800 --> 15:30.867
I'm just gonna walk home

15:30.900 --> 15:33.733
and I'll deal
with this tomorrow.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.867
I guess the,
the old adage goes,

15:38.900 --> 15:42.467
never ride a snow machine
further than you're willing
to walk home.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.067
I'm walking home.

15:48.467 --> 15:51.433
SUE: You can't live in this
kind of an environment

15:51.467 --> 15:53.300
and expect everything
to be perfect.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.767
That's not why I'm here.
I don't want it perfect.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.800
(ENGINE RUNNING)

16:13.433 --> 16:16.767
I'm gonna go make myself
a path to the Twinkie

16:16.800 --> 16:18.933
and jam out some snow.

16:18.967 --> 16:20.633
It's time
to rock it hard, man.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.433
NARRATOR: After heating
the Bobcat overnight,

16:26.467 --> 16:29.233
Sue must clear the snow
throughout camp,

16:29.267 --> 16:31.767
which will provide safe trails
and protect her

16:31.800 --> 16:33.667
from any unforeseen predators.

16:35.700 --> 16:40.500
SUE: You know, I've got hours
and hours of work to do.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.100
It's a pretty big chore.

16:42.133 --> 16:47.400
It's 10 acres that I'm trying
to keep fairly groomed
in and out.

16:51.867 --> 16:53.067
All right.

16:54.533 --> 16:56.167
I got a bunch
of snow macked out.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.933
Got a little trail here.
That was my goal.

16:58.967 --> 17:01.633
But I'm getting cold.
I'm getting really cold.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.933
So, uh, I need to go inside,

17:03.967 --> 17:06.067
put on a little bit
heavier gear.

17:07.267 --> 17:09.200
You know, the staying warm is,

17:09.233 --> 17:11.433
it's not just having layers,

17:11.467 --> 17:13.367
it's having
appropriate layers.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.333
You're not going
to be a beauty queen,

17:15.367 --> 17:17.400
you're being a snow queen.

17:23.233 --> 17:25.633
I'd love to relate this chore
to what a normal person

17:25.667 --> 17:28.600
would be doing in the city,
but I'm not that gal.

17:28.633 --> 17:32.067
You know, there's no service
I can call. It's me.

17:38.733 --> 17:41.667
The goal today was
to get the Bobcat running,

17:41.700 --> 17:43.500
shovel off a few
of the stairs,

17:43.533 --> 17:46.367
and start the process
of clearing camp.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.733
Big drifts

17:47.767 --> 17:50.333
near where I need to go. Um,

17:50.367 --> 17:52.067
knock those down
and get them out.

17:52.067 --> 17:54.333
I've still got
a lot more to do,

17:54.367 --> 17:56.800
so I've got to get
the upper paw on the job.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.167
ANDY: You gotta
take care of yourself.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.733
You gotta be smart
about what you do.

18:03.933 --> 18:05.800
And you gotta try and keep
from getting hurt.

18:05.833 --> 18:08.800
'Cause there's nobody to come
rescue you when you screw up
out here.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.500
Hup, hup. Hup, hup.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.200
Good. Kip, kip.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.433
NARRATOR: Yesterday,
Andy set traps on the
frozen lake near camp

18:27.467 --> 18:30.167
in hopes of harvesting
muskrats for food

18:30.200 --> 18:31.567
before temperatures fall

18:31.600 --> 18:34.467
and the animals
are no longer accessible.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.100
This one's
a little bigger house,

18:36.133 --> 18:39.533
so I'm kind of hoping that
I have a little better chance
on this one.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.433
No, looks like
the same thing, man.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.667
They really packed
this one in.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.200
See, this was all open
when I set the trap.

18:55.433 --> 18:59.133
Whoa. There's a lot
of activity on this one.

18:59.167 --> 19:04.133
Pretty frustrating to open up
the houses and see them
all full of that material.

19:04.167 --> 19:05.933
I hate working
and not producing.

19:05.967 --> 19:08.167
That just really bugs me.
If I'm gonna do something,

19:08.200 --> 19:09.433
I really want a payoff
from it.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.633
My leg hold traps
aren't working too good,

19:11.667 --> 19:15.400
so I'm gonna try using some
of these conibear traps.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.167
A conibear trap
is a body gripper.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.733
I'm hoping that
that's gonna work

19:18.767 --> 19:21.133
and alleviate the problem
of them stuffing

19:21.167 --> 19:23.400
this vegetation into my trap.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.233
See if this thing will
go down in there.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.333
Get this in.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.667
I can try and get it right
below the level of the ice.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.367
That looks pretty good to me.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.267
It's all about adapting
to whatever the situation
throws at you.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.467
And right now,
the situation is push-ups

19:43.500 --> 19:45.767
are getting smaller,
harder to trap

19:45.800 --> 19:47.233
in the actual push up.

19:47.267 --> 19:50.900
So going under the ice seems
like the way to go to me.

19:50.933 --> 19:54.400
(SIGHS) I think I'll go to
the next one and try again.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.233
Looks like more
of the same here,

19:58.267 --> 20:00.900
pushing stuff up
into the hole.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.333
Looks like it was almost
a waste of time yesterday.

20:03.367 --> 20:06.333
They're just blocking
my traps in.

20:06.367 --> 20:09.167
When you're trapping rats,
you've got to be innovative.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.233
If you're not innovative,
you don't keep adjusting

20:11.267 --> 20:12.467
to what they're doing,

20:12.500 --> 20:14.633
then you're not
gonna catch them.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.100
I got a bunch more.
We'll just keep trying.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.367
So far they're skunking me,

20:20.400 --> 20:21.833
so I've gotta do
something different,

20:21.867 --> 20:24.433
because obviously
what I've been doing
isn't working.

20:24.467 --> 20:27.533
Hopefully I can outsmart
these little suckers.

20:27.567 --> 20:30.667
Close this baby up and head on
back to dodge.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.133
Okay. Let's go. Hup, hup.
Hup, hup.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.333
CHIP: A lot of people
don't get the idea
of being out here.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.200
They just don't realise that
we get to shape ourselves here

20:43.233 --> 20:44.500
and we get to flow
with nature,

20:44.533 --> 20:46.300
rather than having people
influence us.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.067
I'm bringing out the things
I'm gonna put in my cache.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.067
Sleeping bags, a box of food,
and a little bit of equipment.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.933
I'm gonna make my sled ready,

21:05.967 --> 21:09.200
tie this stuff down,
and get on the road.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.933
NARRATOR: Today, Chip
and Agnes will plant supplies

21:11.967 --> 21:13.700
along their winter
travel routes,

21:13.733 --> 21:16.567
which will help them survive
in case of an emergency.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.133
CHIP: Well,
this is like a gun.

21:18.167 --> 21:20.167
It's insurance and you hope
you don't have to use it.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.533
So basically, um, we don't
want to have to go eat up
the food that we're trying

21:23.567 --> 21:25.067
to put in place
to save ourselves.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.167
AGNES: We're just
going a little ways

21:26.200 --> 21:28.233
and we'll all come back
tonight and...

21:28.267 --> 21:29.467
Lay it down, lay it down.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.200
Before the weather
gets bad and then

21:31.233 --> 21:33.067
let's go again tomorrow?

21:33.100 --> 21:35.633
If the weather's good.
Depends on the weather.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.333
AGNES: Looks like
there's storm coming.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.767
It's only a couple hours out
and a couple hours back.

21:45.433 --> 21:46.667
CHIP: It's a pretty
important thing.

21:46.700 --> 21:47.933
I'm gonna have
to have a cache.

21:47.967 --> 21:50.267
It might even be a place
we can use in an emergency.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.267
So that's kind of
the whole idea of the cache.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.267
That looks good right there.

22:00.833 --> 22:02.100
CHIP: Awesome.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.500
Yeah, this is nice and deep.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.833
This would be
a good place to put one.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.467
It'll get covered over,
but, uh,

22:08.500 --> 22:10.800
we'd be able to dig this out
and have a windbreak

22:10.833 --> 22:12.500
without having
to put the tarp up.

22:12.533 --> 22:15.233
Why don't you take the axe
and go knock off, uh,
three poles?

22:15.267 --> 22:16.500
-Okay.
-CHIP: Sound good?

22:16.533 --> 22:17.933
Yup.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.467
(GRUNTING)

22:20.733 --> 22:22.567
AGNES: This is
an all right tree.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.900
It got some dry branches...
(PANTING) And it's, um...

22:28.933 --> 22:31.300
(CHUCKLES) Small enough
for me to chop down.

22:36.067 --> 22:37.367
I'm putting the things
in the tarp

22:37.400 --> 22:39.200
that I want to be in the tarp,
and now I'm folding it up

22:39.233 --> 22:40.967
and weatherproofing it.

22:41.067 --> 22:42.300
Now I'll basically
leave it right here.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.667
My wife will come over here
with three poles

22:43.700 --> 22:45.167
and make a tripod,
and we'll mark it,

22:45.200 --> 22:46.467
and we'll move on
to the next place.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.600
Just go around the tree
and push it down.

22:50.367 --> 22:51.667
Just the pole.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.567
Watch out.

22:55.300 --> 22:58.733
This cache is gonna be good
till it starts to thaw, huh?

22:59.900 --> 23:02.200
(GRUNTS) Whoa.

23:02.233 --> 23:04.533
-Wind's getting you?
-The wind.

23:04.567 --> 23:06.167
It's getting strong.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.300
CHIP: It's just the way
it's going right now.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.233
The wind's picking up
so, I'm...

23:09.267 --> 23:12.067
I wanna beat the weather.
So, what I'm trying
to do is get this done

23:12.067 --> 23:13.767
as fast as possible
and I see my wife

23:13.800 --> 23:16.933
is hustling over here
with some tripod material.

23:16.967 --> 23:18.733
AGNES: I'm gonna tie them up

23:18.767 --> 23:20.733
and then put it right in front
of where this cache is

23:20.767 --> 23:24.333
in this tree right here.
This is a good thing to have.

23:24.367 --> 23:27.200
It's got a shelter,
it's got food, it's got

23:27.233 --> 23:29.933
something to make a fire
and melt water with.

23:29.967 --> 23:31.867
Pretty much all we need
to get by.

23:31.900 --> 23:35.400
This is security for us.
Just like money in the bank.

23:35.433 --> 23:37.067
-I think this will be good.
-Yeah.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.400
Can't miss that tripod.

23:39.433 --> 23:41.433
Well, there's no call boxes,
no highway patrol,

23:41.467 --> 23:42.933
there's no one's
gonna help you.

23:42.967 --> 23:45.067
No AAA. It ain't coming along.

23:45.067 --> 23:46.967
-You ready to go home?
Because we have...
-Yeah.

23:47.067 --> 23:49.167
Uh, nothing but a wall
of white coming to us.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.700
CHIP: Let's get her done!

23:56.933 --> 23:59.600
SUE: I'm human, even if
I don't always seem like it.

23:59.633 --> 24:03.267
Things bum me out,
occasionally it reinforces

24:03.300 --> 24:05.933
that I've chosen
a very solitary existence.

24:05.967 --> 24:08.333
But, it's my life
and I like living it.

24:24.967 --> 24:27.267
SUE: So last night, you know
something over here

24:27.300 --> 24:30.267
is, uh, making a lot of noise.

24:31.433 --> 24:34.067
Right there
is the problem area.

24:34.067 --> 24:35.967
My water pipe
has been blown up,

24:36.067 --> 24:38.833
blown off to the side.
What you can barely see

24:38.867 --> 24:40.900
is my communication wiring

24:40.933 --> 24:42.800
is wrapped around that trestle
to take it

24:42.833 --> 24:44.100
from the satellites over.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.633
It's gonna yank down my wires.

24:45.667 --> 24:49.800
Those wires come down,
I can't even communicate
to get help.

24:49.833 --> 24:53.667
NARRATOR: Tundra winds have
put Sue's communication lines
in jeopardy.

24:53.700 --> 24:57.633
And she must secure them
or risk being cut off
from the outside world.

24:57.667 --> 24:59.367
SUE: I've got to try
and move the snow.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.067
Get close enough to that
trestle that I'll hopefully

25:02.067 --> 25:03.900
be on top of the snow,

25:03.933 --> 25:06.400
to get up on top
of the Bobcat,

25:06.433 --> 25:07.867
stand there, and tie it down.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.933
I specifically don't use
the Bobcat back this way.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.400
I've got too many wires
on the ground.

25:13.433 --> 25:14.667
Fuel lines,

25:14.700 --> 25:18.200
it's just not an area I ever
dick with in the winter.

25:26.167 --> 25:29.200
I need to get that tall.
This isn't tall enough.

25:29.233 --> 25:31.300
Done, I can't go any more
this way.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.300
You can see
I'm gonna knock it down.

25:38.167 --> 25:40.700
Come on. For fuck's sake!

25:40.733 --> 25:42.967
The Bobcat from the ground
is not tall enough

25:43.067 --> 25:44.600
for me to stand on
and do the fix.

25:46.567 --> 25:48.600
You know, it's just
so freakin' close.

25:55.367 --> 25:57.100
Yeah, that's not gonna hold
home fry's weight.

25:57.133 --> 25:58.633
I could stack barrels,

25:58.667 --> 26:01.533
but that's how I busted my leg
in three places
a few years ago.

26:01.567 --> 26:03.400
So that's probably
not my best idea.

26:03.433 --> 26:07.167
I break myself one more
good time and I'm done.

26:07.200 --> 26:12.167
I think what I'll do is
I'll get my handy dandy
little ladder, test fate.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.633
Might bust my ass,
but I might find a fix.

26:14.667 --> 26:16.367
I can't think about
the falling.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.133
I have to think
about the fixing.

26:19.067 --> 26:20.433
(SUE PANTING)

26:30.067 --> 26:33.433
(CHUCKLES) It's so unstable.
This is stupid.

26:35.433 --> 26:36.500
Oh, man!

26:47.367 --> 26:49.267
Just do some half hitches.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.133
Back them against each other.

26:55.067 --> 26:56.433
(SIGHS)

26:56.467 --> 26:58.933
This is one of the most
stupid things I've
done in a long time.

26:58.967 --> 27:02.233
I put three turns around.

27:02.267 --> 27:03.667
Not freaking' tight,

27:04.233 --> 27:05.233
but

27:05.267 --> 27:08.067
whether it's absolutely piss
tight or not,

27:08.067 --> 27:09.333
uh,

27:09.367 --> 27:11.733
I got three and then
I loop these two together.

27:11.767 --> 27:14.833
This one here will give it
some downward force,

27:14.867 --> 27:17.167
because I tied it to this one.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.533
Something that silly,
saves my communications.

27:22.733 --> 27:24.467
Who knew?
Bubble-gum and twine.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.600
Probably not the safest fix
I've ever done,

27:26.633 --> 27:28.600
but hey,
credit where credit's due.

27:28.633 --> 27:30.567
I didn't stand on top
of barrels this time.

27:31.933 --> 27:34.267
Frustrating day on one hand,

27:34.300 --> 27:37.467
but I overcame it and I still
came up with a fix.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.200
Yay me!

27:39.233 --> 27:42.067
Life's a river,
sometimes it's full of shit
sometimes it's clear water.

27:42.067 --> 27:43.500
Figure out how to swim, man.

27:47.367 --> 27:48.600
ANDY: I'm always
experimenting.

27:48.633 --> 27:50.300
It seems like a lot
of my experiments

27:50.333 --> 27:51.800
are failed experiments.

27:51.833 --> 27:54.367
But if you're afraid to fail,
you don't learn anything.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.433
Failure is teaching
your best lessons.

28:10.967 --> 28:13.667
ANDY: I'm gonna check my
muskrat sets out on the lake.

28:13.700 --> 28:17.100
The wind came up overnight,
so not nearly

28:17.133 --> 28:19.533
as much fun today,
as it was yesterday

28:19.567 --> 28:20.800
out on the lake here.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.300
First time out
I was just trying to assess

28:26.333 --> 28:29.067
what was going on
out on the lake.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.167
If the push-ups
were even trappable.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.367
And they were.

28:34.833 --> 28:37.267
I set some sets on top
of the ice

28:37.300 --> 28:39.667
on their feeding platforms

28:39.700 --> 28:43.767
and my traps were rendered
inoperable.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.233
So I've modified that now
and I've tried it

28:46.267 --> 28:48.567
under the ice,
in the water.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.167
And I'll find out today
if the conibears work better

28:51.200 --> 28:52.767
than the leg holds.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.400
We'll just see what happens.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.500
Everything's freezing up
pretty bad.

29:02.367 --> 29:04.167
Right now,
the weather's changing,

29:04.200 --> 29:06.600
temperatures are starting
to drop down into zero

29:06.633 --> 29:07.933
and well below zero now.

29:07.967 --> 29:09.267
It's gonna be pretty
challenging

29:09.300 --> 29:10.633
trapping the muskrats.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.800
I'm gonna try and get this
done as quick as I can

29:12.833 --> 29:14.300
and get the heck off the lake.

29:15.367 --> 29:18.767
And hopefully
we got some muskrats.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.233
I don't know if I set that off
or something else did,

29:21.267 --> 29:22.733
but that one was set off.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.167
They chewed off the stick
where I had my trap on it.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.233
So I may have lost everything
on this one.

29:33.567 --> 29:35.400
That sucks. Dammit.

29:35.433 --> 29:38.500
Came in and piled all
of this stuff up
on top of my stick here.

29:38.533 --> 29:41.367
I'm hoping I got one here.
It's all froze in right now.

29:41.400 --> 29:46.067
I think this whole endeavour
would be a whole lot easier
early in the fall.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.300
Out here on the lake
it's probably 15 below

29:48.333 --> 29:49.700
or so wind chill.

29:49.733 --> 29:52.067
Everything's icing up,
which is making it
a lot harder.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.467
Come on, muskrat.

29:59.067 --> 30:00.267
Nothing.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.533
Set the trap off,
but it didn't get caught.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.033
Uh-oh.

30:11.067 --> 30:12.567
It looks like they chewed
this one off too.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.567
Let's hope they're still
in here somehow.

30:15.600 --> 30:20.267
And I don't know
where this trap is.
This froze up too last night.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.767
Unless that's it right there,
that might be it right there.

30:30.067 --> 30:31.833
Nope. Nothing.

30:31.867 --> 30:35.400
I think my muskrat trapping
days are coming to an end
pretty quick here.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.067
Come on, rat.

30:40.367 --> 30:42.167
I don't know, wait a minute,
this one got sprung.

30:44.300 --> 30:48.200
And we got a muskrat! Yeah!

30:48.233 --> 30:50.633
It looks like
the conibear got him.

30:50.667 --> 30:53.033
Finally, a little bit
of success here.

30:53.067 --> 30:55.067
Yee-haw.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.967
That's exactly the way
I wanted to catch him.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.633
Right by the head.
It's a quick kill
and very humane.

31:01.667 --> 31:03.600
They're not gonna
get away like that.

31:03.633 --> 31:06.433
So that looks like
a pretty good technique to me.

31:07.667 --> 31:10.833
And it's a good sign.
So I think the modification,

31:10.867 --> 31:14.133
putting the traps down
in the water was a
real good way to do it.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.567
I'll go over and check out
these other houses.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.333
I got a couple right over here
I'll go check out.

31:24.833 --> 31:26.800
Yeah, looks like another one.

31:26.833 --> 31:28.900
Oh, yeah! We got a rat!

31:28.933 --> 31:31.700
Yeah, buddy. Woo-hoo!

31:31.733 --> 31:34.500
That's the perfect catch.
Right around the neck.

31:34.533 --> 31:36.133
That's what we want.

31:36.167 --> 31:39.867
It's always a good feeling
when you try something
new and it works.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.300
This was a good experiment.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.733
Yeah, looks like another one.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.300
This one by the hind leg.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.733
So the leg hold trap worked on
that one.

31:54.433 --> 31:58.067
This is the last hole.
I'm ready to call it a day.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.200
All right.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.133
Let's see
if we got anything here.

32:05.567 --> 32:07.133
Nope. Nothing. (SIGHS)

32:07.967 --> 32:10.333
Everything's pretty much
closing in now

32:10.367 --> 32:12.700
so quickly that I don't think
I'm gonna be able to

32:12.733 --> 32:14.400
do too much more.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.200
I'm glad I had a chance
to do this.

32:16.233 --> 32:18.233
I learned quite a bit,

32:18.267 --> 32:19.967
developed some new techniques.

32:20.067 --> 32:21.700
All in all,
I think it's a success.

32:21.733 --> 32:24.500
We got some fur,
we got some meat

32:24.533 --> 32:27.100
and, that's what
I'm out here for.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.300
Sun's getting low,
it's time to go home.

32:30.333 --> 32:31.633
It's a good day trapping.

32:31.667 --> 32:34.400
Time to go home and do some
skinning and cooking.

32:34.433 --> 32:37.067

that I wrecked last night.

We'll get the snow machine
back to the hangar,

33:36.633 --> 33:38.433
and get it all fixed up,

33:38.467 --> 33:41.167
and we'll just wasted
about half a day.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.467
That's not too bad.

33:43.367 --> 33:45.433
I went off this bank here

33:45.467 --> 33:48.067
and it just,
it rolled violently enough

33:48.067 --> 33:49.633
that it kicked the track.

is all,

so I gotta find,
I gotta somehow

33:58.933 --> 34:00.400
get this freed up

34:00.433 --> 34:03.433
so we can load
the sled in the sled.

34:06.433 --> 34:08.700
When the sled rolled down
the bank,

34:08.733 --> 34:12.133
this rolled too and it twisted
all up in there.

34:12.167 --> 34:15.467
So I'm having problems
getting it off.

on this?

34:31.100 --> 34:32.467
and then we'll cache
this wood,

towing the snow machine.

Well, we're through
the hard part!

35:18.567 --> 35:20.833
We're just gonna putt home
nice and slow and

35:20.867 --> 35:23.933
get this machine back
in the hangar
and get it fixed.

to heat the house now

35:27.067 --> 35:29.233
for quite some time
with that wood we got.

35:29.267 --> 35:31.333
Although, I kind of busted
my sled up,

35:31.367 --> 35:33.233
in the end, it's still a win.

35:33.267 --> 35:35.633
I just really wouldn't call
it a big victory.

MARTHA: So, what do you think
is wrong with it?

35:50.600 --> 35:52.633
When I rolled the machine
down the hill,

35:52.667 --> 35:55.100
the track came off the rails.

35:55.133 --> 35:56.633
And so what we need to do is,

35:56.667 --> 35:58.100
get it lined up right

35:58.133 --> 36:00.067
and then tighten
it back down. So...

36:00.100 --> 36:01.767
It's just convenient
that we were

36:01.800 --> 36:04.500
-a couple of miles away
from the house.
-ERIK: Yeah.

36:05.867 --> 36:07.333
We'll fix it up no problem.

36:07.367 --> 36:10.400
-Now, we've got tools,
and light, and heat.
-Yeah.

36:10.433 --> 36:13.467
And we got a bunch
of firewood, so let's go
take care of that.

36:15.467 --> 36:19.400
ERIK: I hate to think
of getting firewood and
different chores you do

36:19.433 --> 36:21.067
to live here
as being really hard.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.933
But today it was kind of
a little bit hard.

36:23.967 --> 36:25.733
Sometimes life is pretty
cherry here,

36:25.767 --> 36:28.267
but, uh, cherry is not exactly
what I would describe

36:28.300 --> 36:31.133
as, uh, what
transponded today.

36:31.167 --> 36:33.067
Get an armload and go inside?

36:33.667 --> 36:35.067
Sounds good.

36:38.567 --> 36:41.967
ERIK: I'm happy to have some
of this new, uh, birch wood.

36:42.067 --> 36:46.100
We have, you know,
put a piece of birch in there

36:46.133 --> 36:47.367
at the end of the day and

36:47.400 --> 36:48.700
-it will burn all night.
-MARTHA: Yeah.

36:48.733 --> 36:50.233
-It won't burn out.
-It's good overnight wood.

36:50.267 --> 36:52.533
That is good overnight wood.

36:52.567 --> 36:54.367
All in all, I'd say
it was a pretty good day.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.167
We cut a bunch of wood.
I rolled the sled but...

36:57.200 --> 36:59.767
I'll be able to fix that
no problem.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.733
We're sitting here warm,
aren't we?

37:02.900 --> 37:05.167
Wood in the wood stove.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.767
MARTHA: Then,
I think we're doing okay.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.967
CHIP: If I had a million
bucks, I'd still
be out here camping.

37:12.067 --> 37:13.433
You cannot buy

37:13.467 --> 37:16.300
this kind of adventure,
this kind of peacefulness.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.567
You can't buy this kind
of time with your children.

37:32.967 --> 37:35.533
For today I'm gonna go put out
a couple caches.

37:35.567 --> 37:39.333
My last cache,
my farthest cache.

37:39.367 --> 37:41.333
We've already
set caches at Kookoochiaq

37:41.367 --> 37:42.667
and now we're going
to Independence,

37:42.700 --> 37:44.867
which is the very end of
our trapping-hunting line.

37:44.900 --> 37:47.500
We're taking basically
a gas stash and

37:47.533 --> 37:49.767
a cache of food and
some other safety equipment.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.900
Gas is really important.

37:50.933 --> 37:52.367
There's no gas stations
out at that end.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.833
We have to have a way
to fill up again and

37:53.867 --> 37:55.633
I have to have a way
to tell myself,

37:55.667 --> 37:57.167
or a safety anchor place

37:57.200 --> 37:59.067
that I can go to
where there is more gas.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.600
And I'm taking Tinmiaq
with me today

38:00.633 --> 38:02.400
because my wife's been there
a thousand times,

38:02.433 --> 38:04.067
Ting's been there
maybe 100 times.

38:04.067 --> 38:05.500
But she's our safety.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.900
I want her to see exactly
where these places are.

38:06.933 --> 38:08.333
I'm gonna point them
out to her.

38:08.367 --> 38:10.367
If anyone is gonna get me
parts, or bring me gas

38:10.400 --> 38:11.700
or find me with a broken leg,

38:11.733 --> 38:13.633
it's gonna be
one of my daughters here or

38:13.667 --> 38:14.867
my son in Dearing.

38:14.900 --> 38:17.367
Quite a long ride,
maybe 200 miles from here.

38:17.400 --> 38:20.067
But I can be there in probably
about maybe 5 hours.

38:20.067 --> 38:21.567
It's gonna be
a long trip for sure.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.300
You know, there might be
some danger to it.

38:23.333 --> 38:25.200
Isn't there danger
crossing the street?

38:25.233 --> 38:27.467
It's no different for us,
except we're crossing
the Arctic Circle.

38:32.067 --> 38:34.433
Me and my wife
are really into education.

38:34.467 --> 38:38.767
But a kid in school
can't learn to be warm
out in the minus 40.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.400
A kid can't learn
terrain features,

38:40.433 --> 38:43.167
they can't learn
where the ice is, or hunt,

38:43.200 --> 38:45.333
or gut an animal
without actually doing it.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.500
Whoa, you remember this place?

38:53.533 --> 38:54.567
Yeah.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.233
There the mountain.

38:58.267 --> 38:59.800
Right over there, the creek.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.067
Here's my firewood.

39:02.067 --> 39:05.500
How about I get
the axe off and
we can start a small fire.

39:08.067 --> 39:09.467
I love it when they do that.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.600
One thing we always do,

39:11.633 --> 39:14.400
we always get
the fire started.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.800
So we just got here
to Independence.

39:18.133 --> 39:20.733
It's the end of my dad's
and mom's, uh, trap

39:20.767 --> 39:24.100
lines that they set back here.

39:24.133 --> 39:26.967
I made me a hole
to make a fire.

39:27.067 --> 39:30.200
It's better to make a fire
on top of ice than to make
a fire on top of snow.

39:30.233 --> 39:32.700
A lot of this wood
is, uh, old and dead.

39:32.733 --> 39:34.867
But, um, it's not always dry.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.433
A lot of times this stuff
will get, um, rained on

39:37.467 --> 39:39.600
and stuff like that and
it doesn't have time to dry.

39:39.633 --> 39:41.100
Gonna put a light to that.

39:41.967 --> 39:44.067
-The matches.
-CHIP: Yeah.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.500
-She's on fire.
-Yeah.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.100
TINMIAQ: There you go.

39:53.667 --> 39:55.967
Whoa. It didn't hurt bad.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.333
(CHUCKLING)

40:04.600 --> 40:07.700
So I got some snow melting so
I can make some coffee.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.100
(CHIP MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)

40:17.600 --> 40:19.033
TINMIAQ: Nice and hot.

40:19.867 --> 40:21.067
Coffee.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.500
TINMIAQ: Coffee's done, Dad.
CHIP: Oh, good.

40:24.533 --> 40:26.400
-How far are you?
Almost done?
-I'm almost...

40:26.433 --> 40:29.200
I'm almost done here.
I was getting my ropes
down and I'll join you.

40:29.233 --> 40:32.067
And whatever we don't drink
we'll throw in the thermos

40:32.100 --> 40:34.733
and we'll call it good.

40:34.767 --> 40:38.733
Today, me and Ting drove out
to the furthest point of
our trap line.

40:38.767 --> 40:41.467
And we put in our
anchor. We put in our
turn around point.

40:41.500 --> 40:42.433
This is our cache.

40:42.467 --> 40:44.300
This is the place that
is the biggest,

40:44.333 --> 40:46.233
is the furthest part
of the loop of the trapping

40:46.267 --> 40:48.200
that we do and then
we go back to Noorvik.

40:48.233 --> 40:51.800
We're just about set up. We
have to come back here one
more time. We'll bring a tent.

40:51.833 --> 40:53.000
I'll bring my wife.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.900
She can bring her guns.
I'll bring my traps.

40:54.933 --> 40:56.867
And we'll get
our light winter on.

40:56.900 --> 41:00.400
-Well bud, it's been good.
Look, we got a good cache.
-Yeah.

41:00.433 --> 41:03.067
We got a good trail to follow.
I'm gonna haul ass!

41:03.067 --> 41:05.267
I got an empty sled,
I got a full tank of gas

41:05.300 --> 41:08.833
and a date with your mom.

41:08.867 --> 41:09.900
I'm right behind you.

41:09.933 --> 41:11.133
I bet you are.

41:23.867 --> 41:26.200
ANDY: If you think you're old,
then you will be old.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.167
I think a lot of it
is mental attitude.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.700
So, I try and go
into everything

41:29.733 --> 41:33.200
with the attitude of, "Hell
yeah, let's get it done."

41:41.700 --> 41:42.733
Muskrats.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.933
And I'll take my time
with the first one.

41:46.967 --> 41:49.200
It's been a while
since I skinned one so,

41:50.200 --> 41:52.400
get my technique down
a little bit again.

41:52.433 --> 41:54.733
It's been a unique
fall experience here.

41:54.767 --> 41:57.967
The rats are populating,
so that's good.
It's another food source.

41:58.067 --> 42:00.433
I learnt a good lesson,
start muskrat trapping

42:00.467 --> 42:01.933
a little bit earlier
in the year

42:01.967 --> 42:05.067
before it gets so cold.
I think I'd save myself
a lot of work

42:05.067 --> 42:08.533
and maybe a little frustration
on how to trap them.

42:08.567 --> 42:11.667
But I think I got a good
method now that I know
works when it's cold,

42:11.700 --> 42:14.333
so, it should work really well
when it's not so cold.

42:16.533 --> 42:21.067
A little bit of carrot.
A little bit of potato.
A little bit of cabbage,

42:21.100 --> 42:23.067
tomato and green chilli in it.

42:23.067 --> 42:25.400
And a little bit of rat.

42:25.433 --> 42:28.800
All that took was, uh,
two days of rat trapping

42:28.833 --> 42:30.467
and some cold fingers.

42:31.667 --> 42:33.833
Oh, yeah. She's a bubbling.

42:33.867 --> 42:36.167
Let's see, let's dig out
a nice old chunk

42:36.200 --> 42:39.067
of hindquarters and back.
Look at that.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.300
Mm, mm, mm.

42:47.067 --> 42:50.167
So I got a hindquarter,
a little bit of tail,

42:50.200 --> 42:53.067
a little bit of front
shoulder. Mm, mm, mm.

42:53.100 --> 42:54.600
I'll serve a little bit
of this up,

42:54.633 --> 42:56.133
let it cool a few minutes.

42:56.167 --> 42:58.067
Slurp that stuff on down.
