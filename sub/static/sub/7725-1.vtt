02:15.835 --> 02:18.736
Only a shooting star.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.598
Come on, Andie.
Everybody's watching on TV.

02:22.675 --> 02:25.143
You can't see it
if you don't come in.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.577
Can too see it.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.748
Just another wisher.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.694
He winked at me!

02:49.636 --> 02:52.867
John Glenn winked at me!

02:54.774 --> 02:56.901
I'm going up.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.774
I am.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.012
I'm going up.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.587
We are at Tminus 19 days
and counting

03:17.664 --> 03:21.065
toward main engine test
of Atlantis on July 23rd...

03:21.134 --> 03:22.624
- Thanks.
- Hi, darling.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.296
- I'm not going up.
- Yeah, I heard.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.770
I can't believe it.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.034
They chose Eddie Miller
instead of me.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.973
He gets airsick in cars.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.308
That's why I married you
instead of Eddie Miller.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.906
I thought for sure I was
getting up there this time.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.848
You'll get your chance next time.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.476
Primary objective of the test...

03:40.553 --> 03:42.282
You're damn right I will.

03:42.355 --> 03:46.587
You're not gonna be the only one
in this family to walk on the moon.

03:46.659 --> 03:48.388
Think of the bright side.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.691
You get to spend your summer
with me at Space Camp.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.128
Oh, no.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.864
You promised.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.331
Terrific.

03:57.403 --> 04:01.430
I get to play "Let's pretend I'm
an astronaut" with a bunch of kids.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.805
These aren't just kids, you know.

04:03.876 --> 04:08.711
These are clean-cut
all-American kids.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.409
Make me proud.

04:45.151 --> 04:47.949
I believe this is
one of your kids now.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.380
Yep, I'd recognize him anywhere...

04:51.457 --> 04:54.756
clean-cut, well motivated...

04:55.461 --> 04:57.122
...all-American.

05:04.203 --> 05:06.296
Great boosters!

05:10.810 --> 05:13.370
- Will you turn that down?
- What?

05:13.446 --> 05:15.676
Would you mind turning that down?

05:15.748 --> 05:18.046
Okay, okay, no sweat.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.415
You want Space Camp?

05:20.486 --> 05:23.114
No. My father
wants Space Camp,

05:23.189 --> 05:25.316
but I want my head examined.

05:25.391 --> 05:28.952
- It was worth it for the car.
- Let's hope so.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.086
Yeah.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.724
Would you get your ass
out of my parking spot?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.631
Yeah, right.
Sorry about that.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.472
Space Age technology, huh?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.476
Have a good summer.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.476
Make sure you check
that left mag, Dad. It's sticking.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.016
Okay.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.211
Welcome aboard, campers.

06:27.286 --> 06:30.221
I'm Zach Bergstrom,
director of Space Camp.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.986
We're going to train you
just like NASA trains astronauts.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.324
I didn't say "real astronauts"

06:36.396 --> 06:40.230
because at Space Camp,
you are real astronauts.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.062
Robert Pickett, Purple Team.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.796
Lonnie Fowler, Red Team.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.770
- Kathryn Fairly.
- Kathryn Fairly.

06:45.838 --> 06:46.862
Blue Team.

06:46.939 --> 06:49.032
- Hideo Takamini.
- Hideo Takamini.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.042
Blue Team. Gardener...

06:51.110 --> 06:53.806
Kevin Donaldson, Yellow Team.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.075
Dennis Anderson,
you're with the Green Team.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.344
Susan Lange, on the Green Team.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.716
Ricky Powell,
you're on the Purple Team.

07:00.787 --> 07:04.018
- David Joe, White Team.
- Chris Chu, White Team.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.253
Okay, everybody, let's all
gather in the Rocket Park

07:07.326 --> 07:10.454
where you'll meet
the other members of your team.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.725
Leave your bags here.
You can pick them up later.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.460
Come on, everybody,
let's move it.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.661
Orientation at 1300 hours.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.768
Four years ago
Space Camp was created

07:19.839 --> 07:23.605
not only to provide you with
hands-on access to space hardware,

07:23.676 --> 07:27.305
but also to teach you how
to work together as a team.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.507
Hi, I'm Andie Bergstrom.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.211
You're an astronaut!
The first female pilot!

07:33.286 --> 07:35.117
Yeah. How did you know that?

07:35.188 --> 07:38.351
I've read all about you in
the "Young Astronauts" program.

07:38.424 --> 07:42.292
Let's see, you were the backup pilot
for the first Discovery flight,

07:42.361 --> 07:43.953
but Coats got it instead.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.593
Yeah. I remember.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.794
What are you doing here?

07:51.337 --> 07:52.702
Hello.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.367
- And what is your name?
- Rudy Tyler, ma'am.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.137
Spit it out, Rudy.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.177
Rudy Tyler, ma'am!

08:03.516 --> 08:05.450
I meant the gum, Rudy.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.645
You look like a guy with...

08:10.022 --> 08:11.455
...a lot of energy.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.152
I'm making you
Mission Specialist #1,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.195
Equipment Function and Operation.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.820
Wow. Thanks, ma'am.

08:17.897 --> 08:21.663
My father told me when you come
to Space Camp, they give you...

08:21.734 --> 08:23.793
We'll talk about it later, okay?

08:24.737 --> 08:27.706
By the way, this is Space Camp
and not the Marine Corps.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.833
- Yes, ma'am.
- You can call me Andie.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.440
Hi, Andie. I'm Tish.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.480
Tish AmbrosÃ©.
Right there.

08:39.552 --> 08:44.148
Yeah. So what brings you
to Space Camp, Tish?

08:44.222 --> 08:47.283
Well, I did this audit at JPL
in radio astronomy.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.123
It was unbelievable!

08:49.195 --> 08:53.359
I mean, can you imagine
an extraterrestrial disc jockey?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.730
Like, listening
to radio waves from space?

08:57.970 --> 09:01.371
I mean, like waiting
for signs of intelligence?

09:02.808 --> 09:05.038
- Like...
- I know the feeling.

09:07.113 --> 09:10.173
I'm gonna make you
Mission Specialist #2,

09:10.249 --> 09:11.841
Communications.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.042
Cool.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.884
Max! What are you doing here?

09:16.956 --> 09:21.723
Checking in for my next mission
against the Empire, Your Highness.

09:22.261 --> 09:26.493
Your next mission is to haul ass
back to Junior Camp right now.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.999
Come on, Andie.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.467
I've been at Junior
twwo summers running.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.026
Don't kick me out.

09:33.272 --> 09:37.208
- You're just not ready.
- I am too ready!

09:38.344 --> 09:42.075
Okay, one screw-up, and you're
back in the little leagues. Got it?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.082
Copy, Rogue Leader.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.742
Roger and out.

09:48.821 --> 09:51.051
Hideo Takamini.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.455
- Hideo Takamini?
- Right here.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.856
Hideo Takamini?

09:58.698 --> 10:03.397
Well, actually it's pronounced
Kevin Donaldson.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.994
I don't have a Donaldson.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.706
Well, you have one now.

10:11.477 --> 10:14.674
I'm Kathryn Fairly,
and it's an honor to meet you.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.238
- I'm sorry...
- It's okay.

10:17.316 --> 10:21.275
Okay, I have twwo positions left...
Pilot and Shuttle Commander.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.688
Kevin, tell me why you'd like
to be Shuttle Commander.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.384
I wouldn't, no.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.326
Actually, I was thinking
more along the lines

10:29.395 --> 10:31.625
of Mission Regent...

10:31.697 --> 10:35.155
or Sovereign, maybe?

10:35.234 --> 10:36.929
Something like that.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.929
Kathryn, what about you?

10:41.007 --> 10:43.100
I know a lot
about the space program,

10:43.175 --> 10:45.700
and I'm going
into the Air Force Academy.

10:46.345 --> 10:50.281
And I want to be the first
female Shuttle Commander.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.048
You think that's
more important than Pilot?

10:54.887 --> 10:56.377
Yeah.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.680
It's okay.

10:59.759 --> 11:03.160
You can let her have it
because I don't really care.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.129
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.696
Now that you're
Shuttle Commander,

11:08.768 --> 11:10.759
you're gonna have to
start to care, Kevin.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.997
Kathryn, you can be Pilot.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.164
But...

11:14.240 --> 11:16.037
Pilot.

11:18.744 --> 11:22.043
This is a mock-up of the cargo bay
and the storage pallets.

11:22.114 --> 11:24.605
That arm is
the remote manipulator system.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.174
It can be used for repairs

11:26.252 --> 11:28.914
and to link up with satellites
or other vehicles.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.717
This is a zero-gravity chair.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.055
It rides on a cushion of air which
creates the feeling of weightlessness

11:34.126 --> 11:36.458
you encounter when you
leave the earth's atmosphere.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.224
Come on, Max.

11:43.569 --> 11:46.902
This is the greatest thing
since the X-Wing Fighter!

11:48.307 --> 11:51.276
This is the Shuttle simulator,
which you're going to learn to fly

11:51.343 --> 11:53.573
at speeds of up to Mach 25.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.207
It looks complicated, but when
you get the basics down, it's easy.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.308
The computer does
most of the work.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.410
The first lesson
I want to teach is...

12:06.659 --> 12:10.789
"Why I won't touch anything
until I know how to use it."

12:10.863 --> 12:12.524
- By Rudy Tyler.
- Right.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.260
- Yeah, Rudy.
- Is everybody okay?

12:16.335 --> 12:18.667
This is the Mercury Sigma 7.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.433
When they were
building these capsules,

12:20.506 --> 12:23.407
the astronauts demanded
the engineers create a way for them

12:23.476 --> 12:26.445
to be able to pilot the capsule back
through the re-entry

12:26.512 --> 12:28.070
through the earth's atmosphere.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.910
Otherwise they would feel
like monkeys...

12:31.183 --> 12:32.673
What the hell is that?

12:35.287 --> 12:37.278
A prototype maintenance droid.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.790
NASA built him
for the space station.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.724
- When's he going up?
- He's not.

12:41.794 --> 12:42.988
They blew it on his shielding.

12:43.062 --> 12:46.327
His chips become unpredictable
in about twwo hours.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.423
He's such a complex
piece of machinery,

12:48.501 --> 12:51.299
NASA hasn't been able
to iron out all the bugs.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.497
So he helps out here
and at Kennedy.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.097
Jinx!

12:58.077 --> 13:00.568
It's a midget extraterrestrial!

13:00.646 --> 13:04.275
No, he is the world's only
$27-million handyman.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.080
- Where the hell is that ratchet?
- In your hand.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.447
He's also quite literal.

13:12.591 --> 13:15.492
Okay, we've all met Jinx.
Let's get going.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.604
Come on.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.879
...third-stage separation
before it gets into orbit...

13:36.949 --> 13:38.849
Dennis, I got you that manual.

13:38.918 --> 13:42.445
How many pounds of thrust
does the shuttle produce at liftoff?

13:42.521 --> 13:46.082
6,981,400.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.989
How'd you know?

13:48.060 --> 13:50.392
How in the world
did she know all that?

13:50.462 --> 13:51.929
Got me.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.761
You know,
that Kevin is a real babe.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.394
- He's a jerk.
- Oh, really?

13:58.204 --> 14:00.263
He's completely unserious.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.240
Did you check out
the size of his hands?

14:06.812 --> 14:09.576
Earth to Kathryn.
Come in, please.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.748
What are you doing?

14:18.824 --> 14:22.658
I'm trying to figure out
how to run this thing. See?

14:25.164 --> 14:27.428
For a multi-axis trainer?

14:27.499 --> 14:29.490
It's one of the toughest parts
of the training.

14:29.568 --> 14:32.901
Scary for a pilot.
You know anything about it?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.166
Three concentric circles

14:35.241 --> 14:37.709
spinning in different directions
simultaneously.

14:37.776 --> 14:41.439
Object... to stabilize from
central point utilizing hand controls.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.171
You want a piece?

14:45.184 --> 14:48.847
- How'd you know all that?
- I remember everything I read.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.912
It's a real drag sometimes.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.322
My mind gets totally cluttered.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.691
- What'd you get on your SATs?
- 800s.

14:56.762 --> 15:00.721
You ever, like, talk about anything
aside from learning things?

15:05.371 --> 15:07.396
You know, you're real pretty.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.103
Kind of understated.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.541
But you got great eyes.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.939
You know...

15:15.014 --> 15:18.074
I could do this great
makeup job on you.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.312
Guys go for eyes... kind of.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.283
Guys go for what I haven't got.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.290
Makeup's not gonna help.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.796
Thanks anyway.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.060
What's your essay
going to be about?

15:38.771 --> 15:43.572
"Why I'm going to be the first
female Shuttle Commander."

15:43.642 --> 15:45.769
That is going to go down real big.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.835
Andie will get a kick out of that.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.219
What's yours going to be about?

15:54.286 --> 15:57.949
I'm going to do
"I want to go into space

15:58.023 --> 16:00.491
"to contact life forms
that exist on chemicals

16:00.559 --> 16:02.459
other than carbon and oxygen."

16:02.528 --> 16:04.587
You should visit my high school.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.129
So we struck this deal.

16:09.201 --> 16:12.568
He got me to Space Camp,
and I got me a jeep.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.162
So what are you doing here?

16:14.239 --> 16:17.572
I wanna be the first guy to have
a fast-food franchise in space.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.602
- Rudy T's.
- Are you serious?

16:22.247 --> 16:26.047
Yeah. Some guy in a space station
is gonna get a Big Mac attack,

16:26.118 --> 16:27.608
Rudy T's gonna be there.

16:29.388 --> 16:32.016
So that's why you're here?

16:33.025 --> 16:34.390
Well...

16:35.928 --> 16:37.520
Come on.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.795
I like learning.

16:42.868 --> 16:45.166
Some guys in my school said,

16:45.237 --> 16:47.330
"Yo, Rudy, how come
you takin' science?

16:47.406 --> 16:49.874
You don't need to be
takin' science, man."

16:49.942 --> 16:52.274
They don't ask me
if I like science.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.403
Do you like science?

16:56.448 --> 16:59.383
Yeah. I love science.

16:59.451 --> 17:01.316
Now ask me
if I'm any good at it.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.218
Not so hot, huh?

17:04.123 --> 17:06.318
Some things
I just can't figure out.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.721
It's a bummer, man.

17:15.534 --> 17:19.231
My philosophy is to sleep late,

17:19.304 --> 17:21.431
drive fast,

17:21.507 --> 17:23.941
and not take
any of this shit seriously.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.704
Straight up?

17:30.082 --> 17:33.108
Hey, booster-breath,
leave me alone!

17:33.185 --> 17:35.710
- Let me see it, kid.
- Come on.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.957
Who are you,
the lmperial Guard or something?

17:40.025 --> 17:43.256
What do you got in there?
Let us take a look.

17:44.663 --> 17:46.824
- What's going on?
- This kid's got this thing in there.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.059
We just want to see it.

17:48.133 --> 17:51.102
Why don't you evaporate,
laser-brain?

17:51.170 --> 17:53.604
- Lay off the kid!
- Let's take a look.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.934
Wow, look at that!

17:55.007 --> 17:56.907
Holy shit!

17:56.975 --> 17:59.910
Shit... solid waste
aboard space station

17:59.978 --> 18:02.378
can be handled
in one of two ways...

18:02.448 --> 18:04.439
Jinx, cancel!

18:09.988 --> 18:11.785
Okay, get down.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.799
What is it?
What's it do?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.892
Anything you ask him to.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.460
- Sure moves slow.
- Jinx, shake a leg.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.972
- Don't do that!
- All right.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.067
Man, he literally does
what he's told!

18:32.144 --> 18:35.204
Jinx, move over here, buddy.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.440
Stop it!

18:37.616 --> 18:40.016
Get your hands off me!

18:42.354 --> 18:43.480
Play dead.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.483
That's enough!

18:45.557 --> 18:46.785
Shut up!

18:47.659 --> 18:49.354
Wiggle your ears!

18:51.196 --> 18:52.788
Jesus.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.494
It's broken.
Let's get out of here.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.043
- See you later, Dave.
- All right.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.174
Sorry, kid.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.329
Servos activating.

19:34.306 --> 19:37.241
Sensor generators are okay.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.843
Image analyses are clean.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.107
Retractors stabilized.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.286
I'm gonna put
your shield on now, Jinx.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.191
Don't worry.
It'll be okay.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.056
You're here with your buddy Max.

20:03.068 --> 20:07.437
When I'm done with you,
you'll be as good as new.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.570
There.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.942
Yo, Jinx.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.897
Yo, Max.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.403
All right!

20:43.242 --> 20:44.334
All right!

20:44.409 --> 20:47.003
I can't believe it.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.446
I can't believe those
Green Team jerkoffs did that to you.

20:50.515 --> 20:54.713
What a bunch of monkey clones.
They ought to be zapped.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.382
- Where are you going?
- To zap them.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.789
No, no, Jinx, stop it!

21:03.095 --> 21:05.154
There you go again.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.528
Why do you have to take
everything so literally?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.863
How else should I take it?

21:09.935 --> 21:12.768
No, no, Jinx, it's okay.
Don't worry.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.396
Don't worry, you'll be okay.

21:17.743 --> 21:18.903
You know...

21:20.712 --> 21:23.078
You're really neat, Jinx.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.117
You too, Max.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.713
Friends forever?

21:30.322 --> 21:32.790
Friends...

21:33.325 --> 21:36.385
...forever.

21:40.699 --> 21:42.394
By the time you leave Space Camp,

21:42.467 --> 21:44.697
you will know the function
of every circuit on the shuttle.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.499
You may never get
the chance to fly in it,

21:46.571 --> 21:48.801
but it won't be
because you don't know how.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.432
If you ever get to be astronauts,

21:50.509 --> 21:52.636
you're going to thank us for
making you wear these jumpsuits

21:52.711 --> 21:54.406
because they provide
ease of movement

21:54.479 --> 21:56.276
and additional
storage space in orbit.

21:56.348 --> 21:59.408
The cushions of air
the zero-gravity chair rides on

21:59.484 --> 22:01.042
helps you simulate
the weightlessness

22:01.119 --> 22:04.646
you'd experience during EV A...
extravehicular activity.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.191
That's the work you'd be doing
outside the shuttle.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.750
To work in space,
you have to know how to move in it.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.489
Don't push off.
Nothing will stop you

22:11.563 --> 22:14.691
unless you're acted upon
by an outside force.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.631
Kathryn, it's your job as Pilot

22:16.702 --> 22:20.069
to monitor all the onboard systems
and feed that data to Kevin,

22:20.138 --> 22:23.130
who, as Commander,
is in charge of the orbiter.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.802
You can suit up
in your EMU in five minutes, Rudy,

22:25.877 --> 22:27.367
once you get the hang of it.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.210
EMU... that's extravehicular
mobility unit.

22:30.282 --> 22:34.013
You're gonna need it to do
any activity in the vacuum of space.

22:34.086 --> 22:37.613
Kathryn, give me the coordinates
of the space station at 0100 hours.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.351
You have to call up whatever
information I ask for in a moment.

22:40.425 --> 22:42.222
Split-second decisions are essential.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.558
You're traveling
at 17,000 miles an hour.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.494
There is no room for error.

22:46.565 --> 22:49.090
You'll find your spacesuits
stored in the airlock.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.135
You're on your own there
when you depressurize

22:51.203 --> 22:54.900
as you prepare to move
from the cabin into the cargo bay.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.672
Okay, Kathryn, now it's your turn
in the multi-axis trainer.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.976
This is one of the most
critical tasks to master,

23:03.048 --> 23:06.506
especially if you want to achieve
top ranking here

23:06.585 --> 23:08.519
as a shuttle pilot.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.416
Secure?

23:11.490 --> 23:14.687
Okay, you have 30 seconds
to stabilize.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.954
Here you go.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.360
Thirty seconds.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.998
All right, start it up.

23:27.439 --> 23:30.602
If the shuttle is spinning when it
re-enters the earth's atmosphere,

23:30.675 --> 23:34.167
the astronaut has
just seconds to stabilize

23:34.246 --> 23:36.111
or he might enter a flat spin.

23:36.181 --> 23:39.082
Keep your head centered.
Don't turn it right or left.

23:40.152 --> 23:43.121
- Push your stick forward.
- I got it.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.418
Fifteen seconds.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.424
You're yawing to the right.
Turn it left.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.427
Go right, right.
Come on, you can...

23:51.329 --> 23:55.129
Come on, Kathryn.
You're not a passenger, you're a pilot.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.462
- Fly it.
- I'm trying.

23:56.535 --> 23:59.595
- You've got ten seconds.
- I'm going to be sick.

23:59.671 --> 24:00.695
Come on.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.264
Five seconds.
Come on, Kathryn, fly it.

24:05.043 --> 24:07.944
Okay, shut it off.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.422
I would have gotten it
in another minute.

24:21.493 --> 24:24.587
Another minute, you would have
been burnt up on re-entry.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.131
Come on and get out.
We're running late.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.600
I can do it. You're just not
giving me a chance.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.566
All right.

24:36.541 --> 24:39.999
Five minutes, but that's all.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.076
Come on, Kevin.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.084
Okay, next I'm going to show you

24:47.152 --> 24:50.610
how to strap yourselves
into our orbital exerciser.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.681
- Rudy, you want to go first?
- Give me a hand.

24:53.758 --> 24:58.354
A microgravity environment
is equivalent of prolonged bed rest,

24:58.430 --> 25:00.625
causing the heart to weaken...

25:01.132 --> 25:05.535
You know, I wouldn't
let Andie get to you like that.

25:05.604 --> 25:08.835
I couldn't please her if I spent
the rest of my life trying.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.238
Why do you want to please
anybody but yourself?

25:16.615 --> 25:18.139
I don't know.

25:22.587 --> 25:25.988
I'm not an expert,
but it seems to me

25:26.057 --> 25:30.426
that if you just eased up
on the thing, you could handle it.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.895
You're just trying too hard.

25:34.432 --> 25:36.764
Maybe we have
something in common.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.285
You know, there's this
full moon tonight.

25:56.054 --> 25:59.387
You're gonna turn into
a werewolf or something like that?

26:00.125 --> 26:02.889
No, but I know this great place

26:02.961 --> 26:05.293
where we could
check the shuttle out.

26:07.332 --> 26:11.234
Right. I'll get caught
breaking curfew. No way.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.463
Well...

26:14.039 --> 26:18.237
If I can handle that,
will you go?

26:21.012 --> 26:22.343
All right.

26:26.217 --> 26:27.616
All right.

26:29.554 --> 26:32.250
Say, Max, you got a minute?

26:32.324 --> 26:34.724
You've been coming here
for a couple of years.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.686
What's the best way
to get to the beach?

26:38.763 --> 26:40.594
You're gonna ask him?

26:40.665 --> 26:43.133
Distract and destroy
the lmperial Guard.

26:44.469 --> 26:46.334
You've got ten seconds.

26:46.404 --> 26:48.804
What would Luke Skywalker do?

26:48.873 --> 26:50.636
Howwould he get
to the launch pad?

26:50.709 --> 26:53.075
Kid's gonna go for the droid.

26:56.982 --> 27:00.042
Jinx, what's the best way
to the launch pad?

27:00.118 --> 27:03.246
Go out to main gate,
go to highway, turn left...

27:05.023 --> 27:08.390
That takes me
right by Zach Bergstrom's office.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.258
Is there another way
to the launch pad, Jinx?

27:11.329 --> 27:13.058
A secret way?

27:13.131 --> 27:14.723
Secret!

27:14.799 --> 27:17.734
Turn left before Zach's office,
turn right at Rocket Park,

27:17.802 --> 27:19.269
avoid maintenance building,
go east.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.567
Depending on ground speed,
beach can be reached...

27:21.640 --> 27:23.369
No one talks!

27:52.270 --> 27:54.329
Look at that shuttle!

27:56.041 --> 28:00.569
Can you believe that it can go
from the earth up into the stars?

28:04.049 --> 28:06.540
Look, there's the Seven Sisters.

28:06.618 --> 28:07.880
Oh, yeah?

28:10.488 --> 28:12.752
It's so beautiful up there.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.356
I wish it was like that down here.

28:20.131 --> 28:24.727
So, you're really
into this space stuff, huh?

28:24.803 --> 28:25.997
Yeah.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.639
Ever since
I was a little girl.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.575
My dad used to
take me up in his plane

28:32.644 --> 28:34.737
and hold me on his lap.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.743
Sometimes at night

28:38.817 --> 28:43.345
I used to reach out
and try to touch the stars.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.592
I couldn't wait to grow up.

29:00.939 --> 29:05.035
What's so special
about going up?

29:08.012 --> 29:11.743
In space, anything is possible.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.950
Maybe we could even
do things right up there

29:17.021 --> 29:20.013
instead of screwing them up
like we have down here.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.618
Yeah, but what's the point?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.755
We're all gonna get nuked anyway.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.664
Kevin, that's just an excuse

29:30.735 --> 29:32.794
for people who are
afraid to try.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.573
Hold it.
Hold it one second here.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.409
It's not that I'm afraid to try.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.038
It's just that...

29:46.584 --> 29:49.951
I don't know.
I just don't care, I guess.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.491
- Yes, you do.
- I do?

30:00.031 --> 30:04.297
It's just that it's easier
to say you don't care...

30:06.037 --> 30:07.971
...than it is to try...

30:08.907 --> 30:10.636
...and then fail.

30:20.785 --> 30:22.343
I know.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.449
I'll never tell.

30:28.526 --> 30:31.791
Torture me, kill me...
I'll still never tell.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.192
Fess up. Where's Kevin?

30:34.265 --> 30:36.199
Max is gonna get it.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.258
Kathryn is gone, too.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.826
All right.

30:40.638 --> 30:43.163
Where are Kevin and Kathryn?

30:44.142 --> 30:46.337
Kevin and Kathryn
are at launch pad.

30:46.411 --> 30:48.402
It is a secret.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.479
Let's go.

31:15.773 --> 31:18.037
I thought you said
you cleared it.

31:18.109 --> 31:21.135
Yeah, well, I kind of cleared it.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.180
Yeah, kind of.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.008
Shit.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.259
I'll just be a minute.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.937
We were just talking.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.704
That's not the point,
and you know it.

31:52.777 --> 31:55.575
Nobody cares about Space Camp
more than I do,

31:55.647 --> 31:58.207
and you've been on my case
since day one.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.443
Why?

32:03.621 --> 32:08.149
The first time I met you,
I saw it in your eyes.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.421
It's like looking in a mirror.

32:12.897 --> 32:14.626
You're special, Kathryn.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.962
Why are you so hard on me?

32:22.674 --> 32:25.507
Because someday
you're going up.

32:26.344 --> 32:28.073
But the only way you will

32:28.146 --> 32:32.480
is if you have every drill down
better than everyone else.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.519
There's no room for mistakes...

32:35.586 --> 32:38.749
every "I" dotted,
every "T" crossed.

32:39.857 --> 32:41.848
That's the way I learned it.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.118
That's the way you'll learn it.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.265
You copy?

32:51.002 --> 32:52.435
I copy.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.742
What's going on?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.554
What, is it morning already?

33:13.624 --> 33:15.114
Who talked?

33:16.394 --> 33:18.453
It wasn't me, Han Solo.

33:18.529 --> 33:21.327
The Emperor got
information out of Jinx.

33:25.269 --> 33:29.171
I'm not Han Solo, okay?

33:29.240 --> 33:31.401
And you're not Luke Skywalker.

33:31.776 --> 33:35.212
There's no Empire,
and there's no Force,

33:35.279 --> 33:36.974
and there's no Dark Side, okay?

33:37.048 --> 33:39.881
You're just an ordinary kid,
and so am I,

33:40.018 --> 33:43.283
and maybe nobody ever
lives happily ever after, all right?

33:46.824 --> 33:48.792
So just...

33:48.860 --> 33:51.522
Just stay away from me.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.525
Far away.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.665
I wish I were far away.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.703
I wish I were
anywhere except here!

34:34.304 --> 34:35.567
I wish...

34:37.208 --> 34:39.676
I wish I was in space.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.413
I wish I was in space.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.950
Hello, Jinx.
How can NASA help you?

36:10.401 --> 36:12.528
Put Max in space.

36:14.872 --> 36:19.571
There is no Max listed
in Astronaut Program.

36:21.746 --> 36:24.579
There is now.

36:25.750 --> 36:29.481
How come I have to do
all the dangerous stuff?

36:29.554 --> 36:33.320
Joe Allen and Dale Gardner
did this on Discovery 51-A.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.449
It's okay.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.892
Somehow I don't think that's
gonna make him feel any better.

36:40.665 --> 36:43.463
Range scale at orbit on primary.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.662
Roger. Primary and secondary.

36:46.737 --> 36:47.999
Okay.

36:48.573 --> 36:51.940
Enter OMS 1 burn program, Pilot.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.646
Roger, OMS 1, Commander.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.180
Stand by, Pilot.

37:00.251 --> 37:04.119
Atlantis, this is control.
We have orbit confirmed.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.486
125 nautical miles.

37:06.557 --> 37:10.220
Inclination of 35 degrees.

37:10.294 --> 37:13.786
You are in position
for satellite recovery.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.593
Rudy, man, you're on.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.261
Rudy's the best on the RMS.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.701
Don't worry, Max.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.036
Rudy knows this arm
like the back of his hand.

37:25.109 --> 37:27.475
Sorry, Rudy, I didn't know
you were there.

37:27.545 --> 37:28.944
I almost dropped Max!

37:32.650 --> 37:35.847
Instigate emergency
power-loss scenario.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.285
Killing power, sir.

37:40.625 --> 37:41.922
What's going on?

37:42.493 --> 37:46.793
Somebody get me down from here
or I'm gonna be sick!

37:46.864 --> 37:48.456
Help!

37:50.034 --> 37:52.935
Rudy, relax, man.
You're freaking out.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.767
Get me down from here!

37:54.839 --> 37:58.536
Control, this is Atlantis.
We're experiencing electrical failure.

37:58.609 --> 38:02.204
- Switching to auxiliary cells.
- That's my decision, not yours.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.804
Wait, it's that one.

38:03.881 --> 38:06.816
I know, it's the green one
right next to the red.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.247
- Rudy, what are you doing?
- That was the wrong one.

38:11.322 --> 38:12.721
I got it now.
Here you go.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.781
Help!

38:17.862 --> 38:19.921
Rudy, just cross-wire it.

38:19.997 --> 38:21.294
Sit down.

38:21.365 --> 38:24.095
Sit down!
That's an ord...

38:26.003 --> 38:27.129
Forget it.

38:27.204 --> 38:28.796
I can handle it.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.505
What is going on in there?

38:32.576 --> 38:34.305
We're showing another OMS burn.

38:34.378 --> 38:37.814
The pilot must have hit
the switch when she got up.

38:37.882 --> 38:40.112
Why isn't she at her post?

38:40.184 --> 38:42.846
She's just too busy
doing everybody else's job.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.013
Orbit's decaying, Shuttle.

38:45.089 --> 38:46.613
Okay, take over, Commander.

38:46.691 --> 38:49.216
Hey, it's not my job, man.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.318
You ask the pilot
to do that question.

38:51.395 --> 38:53.886
I'm sick and tired.
I'm doing no more windows.

38:53.964 --> 38:56.023
You're falling out of orbit, Atlantis.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.364
You're coming up
on atmospheric interface.

38:58.436 --> 39:00.529
You're gonna be toast.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.901
My God!

39:03.908 --> 39:06.376
Careful. There's a lot of live stuff.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.479
Pilot, do you copy? Pilot.

39:10.548 --> 39:12.948
I'm sorry,
Kathryn's not in right now,

39:13.017 --> 39:15.485
but if you'd like to leave
your name and number at the tone,

39:15.553 --> 39:17.111
she'd be glad to get back to you.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.554
You're coming up
on interface, Atlantis.

39:19.623 --> 39:21.056
Roger that, Atlantis.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.492
Ladies and gentlemen, please
return your seats and tray tables

39:24.562 --> 39:26.621
to their full upright positions

39:26.697 --> 39:29.063
and extinguish all smoking material,

39:29.133 --> 39:32.660
as we are about to land
in the red zone.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.796
No survivors!

39:34.872 --> 39:36.134
Rudy, we're gonna flunk.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.835
We're not gonna flunk
if you just listen to me.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.544
All of you, stop it!

39:46.250 --> 39:48.411
I'm sorry, but Rudy was...

39:48.486 --> 39:49.817
Quiet!

39:51.088 --> 39:52.578
I don't wanna hear about it.

39:52.656 --> 39:55.181
I can't hear it.
You knowwhy?

39:55.893 --> 39:57.554
'Cause you're all dead.

39:58.929 --> 40:01.796
You just disintegrated
during re-entry.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.132
Don't you understand
what that means?

40:07.171 --> 40:10.937
You're all dead because you
didn't work together as a team.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.315
And you're responsible.

40:21.352 --> 40:22.910
- Me?
- That's right, you.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.080
You're Shuttle Commander.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.592
You are responsible for everything
that happens on this ship.

40:28.659 --> 40:31.628
I didn't ask to be responsible,
remember?

40:33.931 --> 40:36.832
That's a pitiful excuse
for killing four people.

40:38.869 --> 40:42.066
Oh, God.
I don't believe this.

40:42.139 --> 40:45.404
Look, nobody got killed, okay?

40:46.510 --> 40:49.411
I mean, it's just Space Camp.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.515
Launch possibilities.

40:54.084 --> 40:58.282
What are possibilities
of launching Max into space?

41:00.157 --> 41:04.890
There is no possibility
at this time.

41:04.962 --> 41:08.921
This is not going to be easy.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.729
- Hello, Commander Bergstrom.
- Hi, you twwo.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.103
How are you doing?

41:17.174 --> 41:19.165
What's a "firf"?

41:19.243 --> 41:23.612
That's FRF...
flight readiness firing.

41:23.681 --> 41:26.912
That's how NASA tests
the main engines of the shuttle.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.414
This is the first year
we got permission

41:29.487 --> 41:32.854
for you guys to experience it,
and some of you...

41:33.824 --> 41:36.292
...are even gonna be able
to sit in this.

41:37.695 --> 41:40.721
You'll get an astronaut's
point of view. See ya.

41:47.037 --> 41:48.402
Engine test.

41:48.472 --> 41:52.135
Jinx must be ready,
Thursday, 4 p.m.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.725
Max on shuttle during engine test.

42:12.796 --> 42:15.663
How do we change
engine test into liftoff?

42:15.733 --> 42:19.396
Worst-case scenario...
thermal curtain failure.

42:19.470 --> 42:22.371
Define "thermal curtain failure."

42:22.439 --> 42:24.964
Failure of heat shield
during engine test.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.010
Only one booster will ignite.

42:27.077 --> 42:29.136
Result... forced launch.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.477
Why launch?

42:31.549 --> 42:34.484
If you do not light
the second booster at launch,

42:34.552 --> 42:37.316
the shuttle will lift off
and crash.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.618
That is unacceptable.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.158
To avoid worst-case scenario,

42:42.226 --> 42:44.592
second booster must be ignited.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.220
Result... perfect launch.

42:47.031 --> 42:49.727
Thermal curtain failure possibilities?

42:49.800 --> 42:55.170
One thermal curtain failure
every 4.9 million years.

42:55.239 --> 42:58.003
Max won't live that long.

42:58.075 --> 43:01.511
Max needs
thermal curtain failure.

43:01.579 --> 43:06.107
Max and Jinx friends...

43:06.183 --> 43:08.583
forever.

43:09.753 --> 43:13.917
I can't believe our luck!
We get to sit inside the shuttle.

43:14.758 --> 43:18.694
Hold at Tminus 60 minutes
until the test firing

43:18.762 --> 43:21.458
of the three main engines
aboard Atlantis.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.727
At this time,
the orbiter test conductor...

43:23.801 --> 43:26.099
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.572
- You all right?
- Yeah.

43:32.643 --> 43:35.043
You heard
just a few minutes ago...

43:35.112 --> 43:39.242
It's amazing, isn't it?
I can't believe our luck!

43:39.316 --> 43:41.580
...countdown cut-off procedures.

43:41.652 --> 43:44.382
We will continue the countdown
on board the shuttle...

43:47.257 --> 43:48.747
The engine ignition occurs

43:48.826 --> 43:51.954
at about six seconds
prior to Tminus zero.

43:53.263 --> 43:56.391
Everything has been
continuing to go very smoothly

43:56.467 --> 43:58.697
here in the firing room
at the Launch Control Center

43:58.769 --> 44:01.829
and out at Launch Pad 39A.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.768
Once again, the duration
of this test firing

44:05.843 --> 44:08.539
will be between 20
and 22 seconds.

44:08.612 --> 44:11.877
The test should be completed
at the plus time shown on the clock,

44:11.949 --> 44:15.942
a mission-elapsed time
of approximately 15 seconds.

44:17.054 --> 44:21.218
The next 20 minutes are going to be
the most exciting of your life.

44:21.291 --> 44:25.660
Twenty minutes?
I wish twwenty days!

44:37.007 --> 44:39.373
Max into shuttle.

44:41.745 --> 44:44.976
Engine test into launch.

44:45.049 --> 44:48.246
Max into space.

44:49.086 --> 44:51.680
Our NASA test director
will be verifying...

44:51.755 --> 44:53.882
We don't have
a lot of time in here.

44:53.957 --> 44:56.152
Watch your heads
when you come in.

45:01.832 --> 45:03.891
Look at this place!

45:03.967 --> 45:07.027
- I feel like a real explorer!
- It is so incredible!

45:07.104 --> 45:08.867
- Is that a closet?
- No.

45:08.939 --> 45:12.602
Everybody take the seats that
you were assigned in the simulator.

45:12.676 --> 45:14.803
Kathryn and Kevin,
get up in your seats.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.846
In space it doesn't matter
where the seats are.

45:16.914 --> 45:18.848
- How do you get up?
- Just hop up.

45:18.916 --> 45:19.905
There you go.

45:19.983 --> 45:22.281
The only thing missing here
is a tape deck.

45:22.352 --> 45:24.877
Pilot and Commander strapped in.

45:25.956 --> 45:27.423
This is amazing!

45:27.491 --> 45:29.482
It's better than
the Millennium Falcon!

45:29.560 --> 45:31.653
I can't believe they actually fly this.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.890
Max, Tish, take your seats
on the mid-deck.

45:33.964 --> 45:35.955
If you need any help,
just holler.

45:36.033 --> 45:38.968
Roger, Commander.
I'll arm the laser guns.

45:41.238 --> 45:42.762
May the Force be with you.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.171
Please put on your helmets

45:44.241 --> 45:46.232
and make sure
your headsets are plugged in.

45:46.310 --> 45:48.676
Pilot and Commander,
unstow cue cards.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.213
Roger.

45:50.280 --> 45:53.875
Cue cards? Right.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.653
APU fuel.

45:58.155 --> 45:59.952
Right RSC cross-feed.

46:00.023 --> 46:01.547
Is everybody set?

46:01.625 --> 46:03.422
- Roger.
- Roger.

46:03.494 --> 46:06.759
- Kevin, look at that!
- It's a bunch of numbers to me.

46:06.830 --> 46:09.390
Control, this is Atlantis.
Do you copy?

46:09.466 --> 46:11.957
Roger, Atlantis.
This is Launch Control.

46:12.035 --> 46:14.060
Radio check, over.

46:14.138 --> 46:17.107
Solid Rocket Boosters A and B,
ignition off.

46:17.174 --> 46:20.371
- Stand by for main engine test.
- Stand by.

46:21.378 --> 46:23.141
Atlantis, do you copy?

46:23.981 --> 46:26.074
She's all yours.

46:30.387 --> 46:31.615
Go ahead.

46:33.056 --> 46:35.684
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

46:36.493 --> 46:38.688
Come on, will you
answer the man?

46:40.330 --> 46:41.592
Thanks.

46:47.504 --> 46:50.632
Control, this is Atlantis.

46:50.707 --> 46:53.938
Radio check satisfactory. Over.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.148
I heard that, Kathryn!

47:03.854 --> 47:05.719
Stand by for FRF ignition.

47:05.789 --> 47:07.518
Counting down.

47:07.591 --> 47:09.650
Tminus ten...

47:10.427 --> 47:13.191
...nine... eight...

47:13.263 --> 47:15.925
seven... six...

47:15.999 --> 47:17.330
five...

47:17.401 --> 47:18.834
four...

47:18.902 --> 47:21.268
three... twwo...

47:21.338 --> 47:22.600
one...

47:22.673 --> 47:24.868
Go for main engine test.

47:33.617 --> 47:36.313
We have main engine start.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.222
Tplus five...

47:45.295 --> 47:48.423
Max needs thermal curtain failure.

47:49.733 --> 47:51.667
...nine... ten...

47:52.636 --> 47:54.126
Oh, my God!

47:54.204 --> 47:57.264
...13... 14...

47:57.341 --> 47:59.036
15... 16...

47:59.109 --> 48:01.077
Thermal curtain failure.

48:02.646 --> 48:07.310
Max and Jinx friends forever.

48:07.384 --> 48:11.047
...three... four... five...

48:11.121 --> 48:12.713
We have overheat on Booster B.

48:14.591 --> 48:17.082
- Temperature?
- 1,200 degrees and climbing.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.491
Get that thing operational.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.393
The thermal curtain is failing.

48:20.464 --> 48:21.931
Terminate the test.

48:21.999 --> 48:24.058
We're past shutdown temperature.
We can't stop it.

48:24.134 --> 48:26.432
We have thermal curtain failure.

48:27.804 --> 48:29.328
What does that mean?

48:30.807 --> 48:32.604
Booster B...
temperature is critical.

48:33.343 --> 48:35.777
Kathryn, get out of there now!

48:35.846 --> 48:38.178
Andie, make 'em stop!
Make 'em turn it off!

48:38.248 --> 48:39.237
They're trying!

48:39.316 --> 48:41.580
Booster B is near ignition.
It's gonna light.

48:41.652 --> 48:43.552
Andie, help us!

48:43.620 --> 48:46.612
Light Booster A!
Launch us or we're gonna explode!

48:46.690 --> 48:48.385
What's happening?!

48:48.458 --> 48:50.824
Please, Andie!

48:51.995 --> 48:53.053
Grab her, Rudy!

48:53.130 --> 48:55.496
- Do it.
- Zach, we're not authorized.

48:57.334 --> 48:59.325
Light it or they're gonna die.

49:00.570 --> 49:02.299
Ignite Booster A.

49:02.372 --> 49:05.830
- Five... four...
- Arm booster igniters.

49:05.909 --> 49:07.206
Booster igniters armed.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.108
- Rudy, hold on to her!
- I'm trying!

49:09.179 --> 49:10.976
Go for launch! Now!

49:11.048 --> 49:12.072
Light it.

49:17.554 --> 49:21.490
Kathryn!
Get in the seat!

49:51.388 --> 49:52.878
Go, baby, go.

49:55.559 --> 49:57.493
My God!

49:58.662 --> 50:00.562
We have liftoff.

50:10.440 --> 50:13.534
Bye, Max.

50:29.259 --> 50:31.625
Instituting roll maneuver, Atlantis.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.720
Roger, Control.

50:39.936 --> 50:43.497
Roll maneuver complete.
Atlantis, you're looking good.

50:45.342 --> 50:47.105
Do you want to take it?

50:52.049 --> 50:54.540
Jesus Christ, Zach!

50:58.822 --> 51:01.848
I guess you're not going to
have to wait so long after all.

51:03.427 --> 51:05.292
You're going to have to throttle.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.101
Atlantis, this is Control.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.568
Throttle.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.107
Copy, Control.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.878
Main engines at 65%% .

51:27.250 --> 51:29.946
Kathryn, just hang on!

51:30.020 --> 51:33.148
It's three G's.
I know it's tough.

51:33.223 --> 51:36.386
Kevin, you've got to drop
the solid boosters.

51:36.460 --> 51:38.189
They're on your side.

51:38.261 --> 51:40.695
Now arm SRB separation.

51:40.764 --> 51:42.425
I don't knowwhich ones!

51:42.499 --> 51:45.229
Panel C-3.

51:45.869 --> 51:48.133
On your right side.

51:49.606 --> 51:52.700
Atlantis, you are go
for SRB separation.

51:52.776 --> 51:53.936
Hit it!

52:00.317 --> 52:03.218
Control, this is Atlantis.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.618
We have SRB separation.

52:05.689 --> 52:08.089
- Over.
- They have SRB sep.

52:08.158 --> 52:09.921
Atlantis, this is Control.

52:09.993 --> 52:13.451
Press for MECO.
You are go for main engine cutoff.

52:13.530 --> 52:14.690
Roger.

52:19.302 --> 52:20.929
This will be the lead story...

52:21.004 --> 52:23.871
MECO is on schedule. Over.

52:29.045 --> 52:31.912
I don't knowwhere
this drill's gonna end, baby.

52:32.716 --> 52:34.206
Hang in there.

52:34.918 --> 52:38.911
Roger.
MECO is on schedule. Over.

52:44.361 --> 52:47.125
Control, this is Atlantis.
Do you read? Over.

52:48.198 --> 52:50.257
Atlantis.

52:50.333 --> 52:51.925
We're losing her.

52:52.002 --> 52:55.995
This bird wasn't flight-ready.
They only have short-range radio.

52:57.207 --> 52:58.640
Shit!

52:58.708 --> 53:02.235
Kevin, we have MECO.

53:02.312 --> 53:05.770
Go for ET sep on my mark.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.340
Three... twwo...

53:08.418 --> 53:10.181
one!

53:10.253 --> 53:11.880
Do you knowwhere it is?

53:11.955 --> 53:13.650
I think so. Got it!

53:21.531 --> 53:23.362
They got their OMS burn.

53:23.433 --> 53:25.025
They're still climbing.

53:25.101 --> 53:26.261
Come on!

53:33.476 --> 53:37.572
Tracking reads Atlantis
at 180 by 33.

53:37.647 --> 53:39.478
They're in orbit.

53:49.359 --> 53:52.726
I didn't touch
a thing, Andie. Honest.

53:52.796 --> 53:55.026
I know, Rudy.

53:56.233 --> 53:59.396
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

53:59.469 --> 54:01.664
I think we've achieved orbit.

54:01.738 --> 54:02.898
Jesus!

54:02.973 --> 54:05.533
- Kathryn, are you okay?
- I think so.

54:05.609 --> 54:07.008
You're floating.

54:07.077 --> 54:10.069
Just relax and allow yourself
to flowwith it.

54:10.680 --> 54:14.275
I could lose the liftoff,
but this is incredible!

54:15.785 --> 54:18.379
Weightlessness!
This is unreal!

54:18.455 --> 54:20.889
I feel like I'm flying.

54:21.658 --> 54:24.024
- We're in space, Kevin.
- I can't believe it.

54:24.094 --> 54:27.257
Max, Tish, are you okay?

54:27.330 --> 54:30.788
- Why me?
- I feel sick.

54:31.735 --> 54:33.965
We're gonna die.

54:35.405 --> 54:37.532
We're already dead.

54:38.541 --> 54:41.009
This feels like a dream.

54:45.315 --> 54:48.751
Kevin, is this incredible or what?

54:48.818 --> 54:51.150
You got more guts than me, Rudy.

54:54.624 --> 54:57.422
- Man coming through.
- Oh, my God.

54:57.494 --> 54:59.189
It's like magic.

54:59.262 --> 55:01.321
Max, you gotta try this flying.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.158
Watch your head, Max.

55:06.536 --> 55:09.403
- Are you all in one piece?
- I think so.

55:09.472 --> 55:11.463
- Good.
- Jesus.

55:11.541 --> 55:15.204
Well, I think we have
a few things to talk about.

55:15.278 --> 55:16.870
A few things?

55:16.946 --> 55:18.106
Yeah.

55:31.227 --> 55:34.196
Maybe you can touch
those stars now, huh?

55:42.272 --> 55:44.570
Let me see.

55:44.641 --> 55:46.336
Is that Earth?

55:46.409 --> 55:47.671
Sure is, Max.

55:47.744 --> 55:49.939
That's the coast
of Africa right there.

55:50.013 --> 55:51.878
And there's the Swiss Alps.

55:51.948 --> 55:54.508
It goes by so fast.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.947
What an amazing sunset.

56:03.827 --> 56:07.092
Boy, I could stay
up here forever.

56:09.366 --> 56:11.027
Me too.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.377
Andie, I wanna go home.

56:36.259 --> 56:39.695
- What went wrong, Andie?
- What's a thermal curtain failure?

56:39.763 --> 56:41.230
How did this happen?

56:41.297 --> 56:44.289
It's not important
how it happened.

56:44.367 --> 56:47.359
What's important now
is howwe get back home.

56:47.437 --> 56:49.029
We are going home.

56:50.039 --> 56:52.564
Folks, I'm gonna need
all your help to get there.

56:54.511 --> 56:56.945
Rudy, you and Kevin
stow the aft deck seats.

56:58.181 --> 57:00.877
We have no voice contact
with NASA.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.747
Telemetry is still on.

57:02.819 --> 57:05.617
The safest procedure will be
for them to bring us down on auto

57:05.688 --> 57:07.178
at the next available window.

57:07.257 --> 57:10.021
There are windows out there?

57:10.093 --> 57:12.391
No, it's where we re-enter
the Earth's atmosphere

57:12.462 --> 57:13.952
at the right time and place

57:14.030 --> 57:16.225
so we can land
at Edwards Air Force Base.

57:16.299 --> 57:19.234
First re-entry for Edwards
is in 12 hours.

57:19.302 --> 57:21.896
Okay, we just sit tight,

57:21.971 --> 57:24.303
and we keep everything
running till then.

57:25.175 --> 57:29.612
In the meantime,
I'm gonna check this mother out.

57:30.547 --> 57:33.482
- This is unprecedented.
- I don't knowwhat to tell you.

57:33.550 --> 57:35.541
I gotta give some statement.
They're right there.

57:35.618 --> 57:37.779
I want that gallery cleared out.

57:37.854 --> 57:40.516
Take those kids
back to Space Camp.

57:40.590 --> 57:43.718
- The president has to be told.
- They'll be back in 12 hours.

57:43.793 --> 57:45.954
How am I supposed to
keep a lid on this?

57:46.029 --> 57:48.759
People for 500 miles
know the shuttle went up.

57:48.832 --> 57:51.300
Tell them the truth...
we launched my wife

57:51.367 --> 57:53.767
and five kids from the Space Camp.

57:54.437 --> 57:56.098
They'll never believe it.

57:59.142 --> 58:00.370
What's your reading?

58:00.443 --> 58:02.843
South 5-5-55.

58:05.181 --> 58:07.479
We have to find
an earlier re-entry.

58:08.518 --> 58:12.113
- Why? What's the problem?
- The shuttle wasn't flight-ready.

58:12.188 --> 58:15.749
They won't be alive in 12 hours.

58:18.094 --> 58:20.085
One tank of oxygen?

58:22.332 --> 58:24.800
How long will one tank last?

58:27.136 --> 58:28.660
Twelve hours.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.937
That's not enough.

58:33.009 --> 58:36.911
We'll need more for re-entry,
at least another hour.

58:36.980 --> 58:39.175
So what are we gonna do?

58:42.919 --> 58:45.149
Re-entry to landing...
14 hours.

58:45.221 --> 58:49.123
Estimated oxygen supply...
11 hours, 56 minutes.

58:49.192 --> 58:51.092
Max will erase?

58:51.160 --> 58:54.618
Probability... 100%.

58:54.697 --> 58:58.064
Get Max out of space now.

58:58.134 --> 58:59.761
How?

58:59.836 --> 59:02.498
NASA is working on the problem.

59:03.206 --> 59:05.834
NASA needs help.

59:09.646 --> 59:11.637
Any suggestions?

59:12.549 --> 59:16.315
- Daedalus.
- Of course, Daedalus.

59:18.788 --> 59:21.780
Now if only we could talk to her.

59:21.858 --> 59:23.985
She's a good pilot, Zach.

59:25.061 --> 59:26.619
She'll think of it.

59:35.572 --> 59:40.407
Great. No oxygen was provided
for the life-support system.

59:40.977 --> 59:42.467
What about the propulsion system?

59:42.545 --> 59:44.342
We can raid liquid oxygen
from there.

59:44.414 --> 59:47.406
The propulsion system
uses nitrogen tetroxide, Rudy.

59:47.483 --> 59:49.678
We want to breathe,
not dry-clean our lungs.

59:49.752 --> 59:52.414
Let's think. Where are we
gonna get more oxygen?

59:52.488 --> 59:54.649
I could run down to 7-11.

59:54.724 --> 59:56.385
Right, Kev.

59:56.459 --> 59:57.983
That's it.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.258
- What's it?
- You wanna share this with us?

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:04.766
Yep. We're going to Daedalus.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:08.463
- The space station.
- That's right.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.199
Isn't it still under construction?

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:13.140
But they already
have oxygen storage.

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.369
Kevin, get in the seat.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.935
The rest of you just hang on,
prepare for maneuver.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.072
We're gonna transfer
to another orbit.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.751
I just hope we have time.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.614
We're going
for Daedalus rendezvous.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.122
Prepare for OMS burn.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.017
Roger.

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.321
Power up.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.294
- Kevin, give me a course bearing.
- Course bearing, right.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:42.895
Kevin, you did this
in the simulator. Come on.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.769
I faked it in the simulator.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.171
Then get out of the seat.
Kathryn.

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.438
- I'll get it.
- Out!

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.919
Kathryn, give me a course bearing.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.258
Oh-Niner-5-5-Niner.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.355
Stand by for OMS burn.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.327
Go for OMS.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.907
Roger.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.882
Thanks a lot, NASA.
Congratulations for a job well done.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.214
Okay, give my thanks.

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:32.083
Jerry and Wayne did a great job.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.952
Three for three...

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:38.221
We have Atlantis transferring
to a higher orbit at 76.4 degrees.

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.485
She remembered!

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:42.627
That's it.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.960
Yes!

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:48.535
Give me Daedalus ETA.

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.670
The estimated time of arrival
at Daedalus

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.972
is 26 minutes and 13 seconds.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.874
This would be easier if we could
reach Mission Control.

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:01.610
- Did you do it?
- It was too difficult.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:03.208
Tell me what you want me to do.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.311
Max, do I have to do
everything for you?

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:08.619
You've got a 180 IQ.
You can't figure it out?

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.759
All right, now, Max,
it's very simple, okay?

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:15.457
Just like a dentist's chair.

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.522
Like a Mr. Thirsty.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:21.767
I ain't getting in there.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.033
Max, don't worry, okay?

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:27.440
It's not like you're using it
for much else anyway.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.307
Okay, hop in.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.175
Don't forget to turn
the fan on, okay?

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.824
There's Daedalus.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.333
We made it.

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:13.154
Andie, I knowwe made it here,

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:15.213
but how are we gonna
make it to re-entry

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.759
without help from Ground Control?

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:20.796
Well, I've been giving that
a lot of thought lately,

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.626
and I've come up
with one good idea.

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:24.529
- I had an idea.
- What?

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.693
Well, you know how you said...

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.937
Like, how you said
they have that telemetry stuff

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.500
and, like, they could
read all our instruments?

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:36.943
Well, I was thinking...

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:40.278
or maybe I was just inspired
by the view and all...

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.018
Is that India we're coming up on?

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.678
What idea?

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:48.519
Yeah, well, code.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.286
The CXT switch?

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.418
You mean Morse code.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.588
Yeah, I read a book on it once.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.461
Terrific.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:01.466
Go get on the switches.
Good idea, Tish.

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:03.402
They've gotta hear us.

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.770
All right, Kathryn, I need you
to help me get ready.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.333
It's time for me
to get into the airlock.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.934
Sounds good...

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:44.438
Jinx help NASA.

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:47.038
Jinx help NASA.

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:50.311
Jinx help NASA.

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:53.981
Max, are all the elements
of the spacesuit in place?

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.045
Check.

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:56.682
Kathryn, did you
double-check to see

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:59.227
if the portable life-support system
has been charged?

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.387
Check.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:03.227
I'll be in there for a while
suiting up and depressurizing.

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:07.065
I'll establish contact when I'm ready
to go into the cargo bay.

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:09.127
Okay, Rudy, open the airlock.

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:18.336
I'm going to bring back
twwo tanks of oxygen.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.041
We've gotta have a backup.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.622
Once I'm out there,
I'll be gone about 20 minutes.

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:27.953
Once I'm out there,
I'll be gone about 20 minutes.

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:30.891
Don't talk any more than you need,

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.987
and don't move around
unless it's absolutely necessary.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.497
Here, Andie.

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:42.862
Kathryn, you're in charge
until I get back.

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:09.493
I once knew this guy who could hold
his breath underwater for hours.

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:13.229
Nobody could ever figure out
exactly how he did it.

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:17.528
Well, maybe it wasn't hours,

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.904
but it sure was a long time.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:26.544
That was when
I was on the swim team.

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:29.275
It was freshman year.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:35.883
He used to do it, too...
hold his breath for hours...

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.887
...just by thinking
about eating French fries.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:46.768
I guess he really got off
on eating French fries.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.141
You're using up oxygen, man.

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:56.404
Yeah.

01:06:57.613 --> 01:07:00.047
Kathryn, do you read me?

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:01.913
Roger, Andie.

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:04.985
I've entered the cargo bay
and I'm securing the hatch.

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:07.419
Check.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.490
Kind of makes you miss
the good old days of camp, doesn't it?

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:17.088
Really.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:23.302
When I'm locked into the MMU,
prepare to open the CBDs.

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:38.980
Kathryn, do you copy?

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.281
Roger, Andie.

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:45.450
Prepare to open CBDs.

01:07:46.195 --> 01:07:48.823
It's a go for
cargo bay doors, Rudy.

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:54.301
Cargo bay doors activated.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:33.666
What was that, Andie?
I couldn't quite copy.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.776
God!

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:51.853
Guys.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:55.456
We only have one hour left.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.808
I found them!

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:43.606
- All right!
- All right!

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:10.701
Come on, please!

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.931
Shit.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:16.773
Oh, God.
I just can't reach them.

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.005
What?

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.571
They're still
in their storage modes.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.776
I'm gonna have to try it
without the MMU.

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.580
No. Tell her not to.

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.917
She'll have no power,
no control.

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.854
She'll tumble out into space
without her jet pack.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.152
Where is she?

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.847
Damn it!

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:30.044
It's no good.
I just can't reach it.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.088
Well, she has to!
Tell her she has to get them!

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:35.521
Tish, she can't, all right?

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.226
Make her.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.161
She just isn't small enough.

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.561
Well, I am.

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:48.362
You can't go out there.

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.337
It's a good idea, guys.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:53.769
I am ready.

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:57.835
- Push a little harder.
- Double-check everything.

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.873
Is this the only suit
you could find?

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.111
It's the only one down there.

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.381
Tish, give me your belt.

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.946
What an excellent idea.

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.559
What are you going to do
with her belt?

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:16.189
We are going to make
this suit as small as Max

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.893
so he can fit through Daedalus.

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:22.164
All right, Maxwell!

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:44.083
Commander Skywalker reporting in.

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:50.058
Rudy, I want you to make sure
that RMS arm is in lock.

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.032
Double-check everything.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.063
Radio check is okay.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:56.036
What about these doors over here?

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:58.505
It's okay. They have to be able
to get back in.

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:01.737
Okay, Max, get strapped
into the RMS,

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.176
and Rudy will swing you
over to Daedalus.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.307
Roger.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.852
No way!

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:24.355
Let me in!
I changed my mind!

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:27.027
Let me in! Please let me in!
Let me in!

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.501
I changed my mind!

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.663
Max, you have to help Andie.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.902
Let me in!
Please let me in!

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:35.341
Luke.

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.074
Luke.

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:42.417
Use the Force, Luke.

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:46.549
Stretch out your feelings.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:49.318
The Force is always with you.

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.729
- Look!
- Go, Max.

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.891
- You can do it.
- Unbelievable.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:23.580
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.693
Help me.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.205
I'm sorry, Max.
Hang in there.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.016
It's me!
I'm here to rescue you!

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:55.181
God!

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:58.385
I'm small enough
to reach the oxygen.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:02.896
Yeah.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.025
That's the way, Max.

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:12.767
Now unstrap the tank
and pass it over to me.

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:27.251
Only one minute left.

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:30.917
Okay, Max, I'm gonna take this
back to the ship.

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.984
The sooner you get
that second tank,

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:34.892
the sooner we can go home.

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:37.830
I'm hurrying, Andie. Honest.

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:40.732
I know you are.

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.834
Rudy, please keep
that arm steady.

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.743
He's doing the best that he can.

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:54.475
I know, but she is trying
to load the cannisters.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.677
Could you guys argue
without talking?

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:12.626
Well, that's it, campers.

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.526
All we have left
is the air in the cabin.

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:55.068
Oh, my God!

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.304
Oh, no!

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:07.982
Save me!

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.424
I can't stop!

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:15.292
Look, Max.

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.598
I'm right behind you.

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:25.199
I can't stop!

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.338
Don't worry.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:31.004
I'm not gonna let you
get away from me.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.147
I'm getting closer.

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.016
I can't stop!

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:40.952
- Come on!
- Hold steady.

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:47.388
Reach your hand out.

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:49.430
I'm trying to.

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:53.894
- I'm gonna get you.
- I can't reach!

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:58.804
Help! Andie!

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.940
I'm almost there.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.805
I've got your foot.

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:09.144
Okay, I've got your foot.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.899
You think you're scared now?

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:33.673
Wait till your parents get the bill
for breaking Daedalus.

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.856
Forty minutes to re-entry.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.021
They're cradling the arm.

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:55.154
Let's hope there's oxygen
on the end of it.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:07.002
Connect the tank hose cap to the...

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:13.043
...blue valve.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:19.482
Which one?
There are twwo.

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:23.684
Rudy, remember,
this is pure oxygen.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.488
If we make the wrong connection,

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.495
we're gonna be sitting
in the middle of a fireball.

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.554
You must get it right.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:40.766
It's the blue valve
next to the green.

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:50.341
There is no blue one
next to a green.

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.886
No, no, not green.
I meant yellow.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:56.151
Rudy, we're all gonna be dead
before you make up your mind.

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:04.655
It's the blue valve
next to the red.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.223
It's the wrong hose.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.928
It is not.
It's the red one.

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:10.904
Will somebody please
make a decision?

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.204
It's the red one.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:18.746
It's the yellow!

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.374
I have been studying this book
since I came to camp.

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:22.746
I know I'm right.

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.619
Believe me.

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.819
Do it, Andie.

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:37.592
It's the blue valve
next to the yellow valve.

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.323
Please.

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.873
Good job, Rudy.

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:36.290
- All right!
- That was cutting it close.

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:38.383
- They got air!
- All right!

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.221
Let's get this thing
programmed for re-entry.

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:46.358
Put 'em on auto
and bring 'em on home!

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:54.801
Okay, Max, I have it now.
You can go in the airlock.

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:58.578
And, Max...

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:03.808
Thanks.

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.258
No.

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:54.860
What's happening?

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:55.994
Status check?

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.039
We are closing the cargo bay doors.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:00.267
Prepare for de-orbit burn.

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.299
What's going on?

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:04.773
Nothing's responding.

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:07.076
Who's closing
the cargo bay doors?

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:11.181
Help me!
Andie's not in yet!

01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:13.921
Come on, Andie.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.217
Please.

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:23.196
It's NASA. They're bringing us
down on auto.

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:24.595
Well, make 'em stop!

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:32.398
Come on.
I don't have her!

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:35.272
Stop the doors!

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.436
She's not in!

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.409
Look at Andie.

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:43.446
Andie, do you hear us?

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:45.942
Andie, come in.

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.082
Andie, can you read us?

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:03.595
T minus 23 minutes
for re-entry window.

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:04.899
Prepare for RSC burn.

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:07.441
Let's turn 'em around
for deceleration.

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.636
There's a manual
override switch here.

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.812
I saw it.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.211
Where is it?

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.517
Here it is.

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:24.422
If we override NASA,
we'll miss the window.

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:25.982
We've gotta go now.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.961
We can't leave Andie.
She'll die.

01:24:28.029 --> 01:24:29.894
Yaw maneuver complete.

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:31.955
Stand by for OMS burn.

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:40.333
Kathryn, take the window.

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:42.433
It's your only chance.

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:45.476
Prepare for de-orbit burn.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.378
Ready for countdown.

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:48.541
Ten...

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:50.015
Nine seconds.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.254
Five...

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.986
Do something, Kathryn.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.391
Two seconds.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:05.922
Rudy, open the cargo bay doors.
Tish, unstow the medical kit.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.871
Listen, we're going
to open the doors.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.204
Bring Andie in.
This time use the foot restraints.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.140
Hang in there, buddy.

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:23.416
- All right, Rudy, do it.
- Now?

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.826
Come on, Andie.

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:44.137
Help me run a check
on the manual systems.

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.380
Come on, Andie.

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:18.601
Okay, Max.
Okay, let her go.

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:21.965
I got her.

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:27.504
All right, guys,
let's take this thing off her.

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:36.787
I'll get her gloves.
Let's get her out of the EMU.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:39.827
- Transport her to the sleep station.
- Tish, anything?

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.663
No, nothing.

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:50.029
I don't get it.
Why would she override auto?

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:53.870
And miss the window.
How much oxygen did they buy?

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:56.968
Not enough to make it
to the next window at Edwards.

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.775
Why would she
miss their last chance?

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:04.508
What the hell else
is going wrong up there?

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.691
How is she?

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.129
I think she
shattered her arm

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:23.693
and she broke her ribs.

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:26.001
I don't know, really.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.008
So, Kevin,
what the hell do we do?

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:32.646
Rudy, I don't know.

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:35.114
Well, we have got to do something.

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:38.584
Christ, I'm not a doctor!
I don't knowwhat to do!

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:42.650
Look, guys...

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:45.659
Just get back to your stations,

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:49.390
and I'll stay here...
with Andie.

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:51.728
I want to stay with Andie.

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.297
I'll stay with Andie, okay?

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:58.464
You just get back
to your stations.

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:27.997
I guess we just keep doing
what we're doing.

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.779
We missed the window.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.787
I know.

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:51.952
We don't have enough oxygen
to last till the primary for Edwards.

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:57.092
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah?

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:01.801
Do they think so?

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:06.063
Andie's part of the crew.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.404
You took responsibility for her.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:13.105
Somebody had to.

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.179
Great.

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:20.285
That's what makes
a good flight commander.

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:26.316
I'm a good pilot,
but I'm no commander.

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:31.321
My mom always says that...

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:37.433
...being boss and being bossy
isn't the same.

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.973
I'm never gonna
see her again, am I?

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.911
Come on. Come on.

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:51.318
- There's nothing new here.
- There's something we're missing.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:54.355
Yes, Mr. President.
We'll stay in touch.

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:58.454
The only thing
we're missing is a miracle.

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.801
- I've got an idea.
- Let's hear it.

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.133
Come here.

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.876
Hey, guys.

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.536
I've got a question.

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:23.413
I was looking outside
and wondering,

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:26.351
is Edwards the only place
where we can land?

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:29.015
- I don't know. Is it?
- I don't know.

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:33.652
I remember reading about the shuttle
landing in White Plains or something.

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:36.891
Come on, it's in the middle
of New York.

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:40.092
White Sands.
White Sands, New Mexico.

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.635
Columbia of '82 landed there

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:44.262
'cause the strip at Edwards
was too wet.

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:46.568
So if we could make
the window to White Sands...

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:47.869
We can land there.

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.432
Tish, get going.

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.307
- Make them hear us.
- All right.

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:53.939
Rudy, I love you.

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:56.415
- Check out the coordinates.
- You got it.

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.145
Max, take care of Andie for me.

01:30:58.219 --> 01:31:00.813
Let's see if we can
navigate this bird ourselves.

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:02.913
I'm not gonna speculate
about anything.

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.252
What about the kids?

01:31:04.325 --> 01:31:06.816
As soon as I have something
to confirm, I will.

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:17.328
Jinx put Max in space.

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.737
Jinx can get Max back.

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:24.404
Jinx put Max in space.
Jinx can get Max back.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.413
Jinx put Max in space.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.176
How'd you know
about Max, Jinx?

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:31.275
Jinx and Max friends forever.

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:33.149
Jesus Christ.

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:35.451
Get that thing out of here.
Get security.

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:37.957
Maybe he can help us,
unless you've got a better idea.

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.686
Wait a minute!

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:45.095
Jinx, how can you help NASA?

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:48.795
C-O-M-E l-N...

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:52.271
C-O-N-T-R-O-L...

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.308
Take it out of here.
Get it out.

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:56.434
...M- E l-N...

01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:00.208
C-O-N-T-R-O-L...

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.407
Come in, Control.

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:03.780
C-O-M-E l-N...

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:07.446
C-O-N-T-R-O-L...

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:08.614
Come in, Control.

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.316
Max's code.

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:13.019
- Morse code.
- Max's code.

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:16.257
Damn! They're talking to us!
We got Morse code.

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.025
Jack, translate this.

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.931
Jinx, I'm treating you
to a can of oil.

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:27.902
Request... alternate...

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.567
landing...

01:32:29.644 --> 01:32:30.668
White...

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:34.181
White Sands.
Columbia, '82... check it out.

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:37.149
White Sands re-entry window
is nine minutes.

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.877
Get me White Sands.

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.945
We have to send them
a landing softwware update.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.581
I hope White Sands is ready for this.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.785
They'll make it ready.
It's our only shot.

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:51.359
- They're never gonna hear this.
- Just keep going, Tish.

01:32:56.037 --> 01:32:58.096
What's wrong now?

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:05.034
Whip me, beat me,
take away my charge card!

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.670
NASA is talking!

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:19.825
- Did somebody say NASA?
- It's NASA!

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:22.055
It's NASA!

01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:26.330
Guys, they need
an OMS burn, like now!

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.164
- OMS burn coming right up.
- Window coordinates?

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:32.069
She's gotta slow that thing
down to 4,800.

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:34.664
It's not Andie, Zach.
I just got that.

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.437
Andie's hurt.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.569
Some kid named Kathryn
is flying the bird.

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.713
113 by 17.

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:45.650
Window coordinates...
113 by 17.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.985
Roger that.
We figured 250 by 19.

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:50.751
Well, we weren't that far off.

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:52.850
Our time parameter... 0210.

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:55.953
We have to be at re-entry
at 0210, and that's in...

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.130
That's in six minutes!

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:03.426
Zach wants to know
how Andie's doing.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.067
Give me a headset.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:11.202
- She wants a headset.
- She wants a headset?

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:14.338
Okay, Andie, relax.
Don't worry about it.

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.280
We can handle it, okay?

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:19.012
Max, you and Andie
get strapped in.

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:21.951
Get me out of this now.

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:24.150
Helium pressure...

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.454
Kevin, you know,
I never knew how to do this.

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:31.760
- I don't know...
- Of course you can do it.

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:33.265
No, it's re-entry.

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:35.325
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:37.894
We'll all die, right?

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:40.964
We're all gonna die
if you don't do it,

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:43.306
so just relax, okay?
You're panicked.

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:45.140
You're damn right I'm panicked.

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:48.306
Okay, fine. That's perfect.
I'll do it.

01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:49.508
All right.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:53.280
Tish, you ever read a book
on how to fly this thing?

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.250
Okay, I'll do it.

01:34:57.324 --> 01:35:00.418
So competitive, aren't we?

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.427
Okay, team.

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:06.365
Let's put these helmets on,
and let's do it.

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:09.993
Okay, Kathryn,
lock coordinates in.

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.200
Coordinates locked in.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:17.034
Stand by for OMS burn.

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:20.979
Twenty-nine seconds
and counting.

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:24.245
Hey, Max, we're going home.

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:27.014
Great! I'm starving.

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:29.056
All right, OMS burn
on my mark.

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:32.185
Three... twwo...

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:34.523
one... mark.

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.969
Preparing for yaw maneuver.

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.471
You're doing great, Pilot.

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:59.448
Come on, Kathryn,
you can do it.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.714
Just take it easy.

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:04.849
Entry interface in twwo minutes.

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.400
Re-entry's in range.

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.531
Prepare for 180 roll.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.337
Standing by.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:25.270
Okay, and...

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.112
Go for roll.

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:38.591
You're lookin' good!

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:47.625
We're passing through 135 degrees
on the way to 180, Andie.

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.726
You said you couldn't
fly this thing.

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:54.073
I think we came around too much.

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:58.040
- Oh, no, wait a minute.
- What's wrong?

01:36:58.112 --> 01:37:00.273
- What's happening?
- Look!

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:06.853
Kathryn, make it stop!

01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:08.183
Kathryn, you're in a flat spin.

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:09.984
You've got to concentrate.

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:20.096
She's lost it.
She's coming in out of control.

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:22.328
Ionization blackout
in 30 seconds.

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.064
Tracking's gonna lose them.

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.969
Coming up on re-entry.
We've gotta stabilize.

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:32.069
You guys, get strapped in!

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.506
What happened to the lights?

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:39.376
The trainer.

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:42.013
Remember the trainer.
You can do it.

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:50.596
Kathryn, listen to me.

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:54.760
We talked about
when it would be your turn.

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:56.564
This is it.

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:58.867
Do you copy?

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:03.100
I copy.

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:26.292
Good work.

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:34.270
You've got to bring the nose up.

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:36.036
We have to go in
at an angle.

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:39.477
Right. Re-entry angle should be
30 degrees at least.

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:42.174
We're at 26.

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.410
Twenty-seven. Keep going.

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:49.312
Twenty-eight!

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:54.694
- Ionization blackout.
- We've lost contact.

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:03.535
Watch the readout
on the nose attitude indicator.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.765
You can fly it, Kathryn.

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:08.841
Keep the nose at 30 degrees.

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:11.370
Twenty-nine...

01:39:11.445 --> 01:39:13.845
Just a little bit more.
Push it. Thirty!

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:23.083
- It's not holding.
- We're burning up!

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:29.258
Come on, be there.

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.927
Don't push it.
Ease up on the yawjets.

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:36.765
Come on!
Come on, keep holding it.

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:41.799
Come on.

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:49.279
Kathryn, you can do it.

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:20.669
Where are we?

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:26.514
We're dead.
We didn't make it.

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.818
I knowwe made it.

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.525
I knowwe did.

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:46.933
Goldstone's picked them up.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.675
You did it.

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:59.552
- She did it!
- Good job, Kathryn.

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:03.783
Good flying, Kathryn!

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.422
Oh, God.

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:09.621
Good job.

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:11.728
You did it, Kathryn.

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:14.700
No. We all did it.

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.633
Damn right we did!

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.303
We all did it.

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:27.345
Atlantis, this is Control.
Do you copy?

01:41:27.414 --> 01:41:30.383
- Mission Control!
- NASA!

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:32.442
Copy that, Control.

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:34.350
This is Atlantis.

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:35.979
All right!

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:45.196
Way to go.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:49.760
Andie, are you all right?

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.894
Yeah.

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.506
We're all fine.

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:57.608
We're just real happy to be home.

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.502
Amen.

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:20.398
Atlantis, we have you on auto
and we are bringing you home.
