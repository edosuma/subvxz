WEBVTT

00:13.647 --> 00:14.758
Hush.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.193
If you stop moving,
he'll wake up.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.494
It's almost 2:00 a.m.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.329
He's gonna be hungry again
in an hour.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.964
I read about a kid
that couldn't sleep

00:20.988 --> 00:22.399
unless he was in a moving car.

00:22.423 --> 00:26.403
His parents drove
3,000 miles in a month.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.804
Sit for five minutes.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.573
I'll take over.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.308
Give me ten.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.333
Greedy.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.448
- Stay here. Stay here.
- No.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.050
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.252
It's gonna be okay.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.355
Help, somebody help!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.457
Oh, my... God!

00:47.481 --> 00:49.039
Neil, come back!

01:26.821 --> 01:29.099
Oh, yeah!

01:29.123 --> 01:30.901
A date.

01:30.925 --> 01:34.071
Let's just say that something
very special is happening to...

01:34.095 --> 01:36.006
very Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo today.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.841
Who are you seeing?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.376
Kurosawa.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.544
Really?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.379
Did not know
you were into Asian women.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.680
Kurosawa is a dude.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.583
I certainly did not know
you were into Asian dudes.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.419
Akira Kurosawa,
who, as I'm sure you are aware,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.822
is one of the greatest
filmmakers of all time.

01:51.846 --> 01:54.724
He's having a little festival
of his films at the Odeon.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.927
Seven Samurai
and The Hidden Fortress.

01:56.951 --> 01:57.994
Man movies.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.563
They're great works of art.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.398
This is a great work of art.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.933
Oh, yeah? What do you got there?

02:02.957 --> 02:04.434
New Judy Blume?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.403
I always liked Are You There,
God? It's Me, Margaret.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.739
This, my friend, is
the Declaration of Independence.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.341
My citizenship test
is coming up,

02:11.365 --> 02:13.043
and I wish to pass
with swimming colors.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.177
Flying colors.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.812
Any colors will do, McGee.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.048
Ah, Timmy. You look a little
rough around the edges there.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.883
You up all night
playing video games again?

02:19.907 --> 02:21.451
Well, I will admit
that maintaining

02:21.475 --> 02:23.987
my state-of-the-art status
is exhausting.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.590
But you are looking at a man

02:26.614 --> 02:27.991
who has his whole
apartment wired

02:28.015 --> 02:29.493
to a single remote control.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.494
Everything?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.995
Even the microwave.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.396
Wow.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.232
It's like the Clapper.
Remember that?

02:35.256 --> 02:36.733
Clap on, clap off.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.969
Oh, I am living the dream, baby.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.637
Nah, no clapping yet.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.561
Norfolk. Dead navy officer.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.574
Hey, uh, boss, do you mind

02:44.598 --> 02:46.009
if I grab some coffee
real quick?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.711
Yeah, I do. We got no time.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.726
Here, suck on this, Butternuts.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.175
Oh, it does taste like coffee.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.720
Wait, did he just tell me to?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.075
Suck it up, McGee.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.393
Well, look at this.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.282
The cavalry's arrived.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.631
Who knew homicide in Norfolk

03:07.655 --> 03:09.599
meant working with you guys
all the time.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.734
Navy town, navy crimes.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.736
Could be worse, right?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.372
Morning, Agent David.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.040
Good morning, Detective.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.341
Ziva, why don't you
get statements.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.543
McGee, physical evidence.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.711
I'm gonna take
some photographs, so...

03:21.735 --> 03:23.446
Sorry, boss. Uh...

03:23.470 --> 03:26.183
If there's anything you need,
sir, I'm right here.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.884
Witnesses?

03:27.908 --> 03:29.553
Three, so far.
Couple walking their baby

03:29.577 --> 03:31.788
heard it,
but didn't see the assailant.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.057
That's the vic's fiancée
over there.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.226
Been there all night,
saw it up close.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.649
Not hurt but rattled pretty bad.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.367
Put that insidious device
away, Mr. Palmer.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.803
This is a crime scene,
not a chat room.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.938
Sorry, Doctor. It's just...

03:47.962 --> 03:50.273
it's just, uh,
she texted me "yes."

03:50.297 --> 03:51.274
- What?!
- Yeah.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.909
Oh, splendid!

03:52.933 --> 03:53.933
Splendid.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.079
Ah, Jethro.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.148
Palmer's embalmer
said yeah, huh?

03:58.172 --> 03:59.616
The little funeral home girl?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.986
Listen, Palmer,
girls who work down there

04:03.010 --> 04:05.155
in the mortuaries,
they like to do it in the dark.

04:05.179 --> 04:06.289
So what you want to do is...

04:06.313 --> 04:07.357
Focus, DiNozzo.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.391
Sorry, boss. Focusing.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.060
It's Navy Captain Joseph Norton.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.861
Lived here in Norfolk.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.964
There's a lot of cash
in his wallet.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.478
Well, looks like
that ring box is empty there.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.302
Maybe, uh, left the money,

04:19.326 --> 04:20.971
took the ring,
unless the lady's wearing it.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.340
- Well, I don't see a ring around here anywhere.
- Duck?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.375
Well, multiple wounds
to the torso.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.544
Significant loss of blood.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.179
As to the time of death...

04:29.203 --> 04:30.680
No need. We got witnesses.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.849
Ah, usually our investigations

04:32.873 --> 04:35.318
don't come
with such a value-added bonus.

04:35.342 --> 04:38.521
Mr. Palmer,
let us prepare the captain

04:38.545 --> 04:40.657
for his final voyage.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.582
Mind if I talk to your witness?

04:45.252 --> 04:46.229
She's yours now.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.345
Just keep me in the loop.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.167
So you saw the attacker's face?

04:51.191 --> 04:52.369
No, not really.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.937
It was so dark.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.372
It was very fast.

04:55.396 --> 04:59.355
Ma'am, um, I'd like you to meet,
uh, Special Agent Gibbs.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.907
Jethro...

05:12.313 --> 05:14.391
Hey, Joann.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.027
This is a surprise.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.396
You two know each other?

05:19.420 --> 05:23.066
Agent David, Joann Fielding,

05:23.090 --> 05:24.067
my mother-in-law.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.069
Ex-mother-in-law.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.805
Shannon's mom.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.141
Kelly's grandmother.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.411
Well, uh, so when was
the last time

05:34.435 --> 05:36.096
you two saw each other?

05:37.137 --> 05:39.628
The girls' funeral.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.227
All right, McNosy,
what do you got?

05:51.251 --> 05:52.462
Well, from what I can gather,

05:52.486 --> 05:55.231
Gibbs and Joann Fielding
are very estranged.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.867
The woman lost her daughter
and her granddaughter.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.869
Now her fiancé died in her arms

05:59.893 --> 06:01.738
and her former son-in-law
is investigating.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.839
Show some sympathy.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.508
M-Maybe she's cursed,
like a Kennedy.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.576
Minus the grassy knoll.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.810
I heard about that.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.893
The shooter was really
in the book suppository.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.348
Depository.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.683
That's what I said.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.684
I'm listening.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.853
Hey, boss.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.222
Um, we, uh,
just checked the cameras

06:19.246 --> 06:21.157
covering the waterfront;
Nothing caught the suspect.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.259
Which means he probably knew
where the cameras

06:23.283 --> 06:24.894
were positioned
and how to avoid them.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.429
Which means?

06:26.453 --> 06:28.397
He's familiar
with the promenade, so we should

06:28.421 --> 06:31.701
start questioning the employees,
the marina shopkeepers,

06:31.725 --> 06:32.902
and, you know, the residents.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.926
Victim?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.239
Captain Joseph L. Norton.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.075
Supply Corps,
63 years old, no family.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.677
Six months from retirement,
spotless service record.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.513
- Never been married.
- He was about to be.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.714
What about the engagement ring?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.215
Yeah.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.718
This is a copy of the receipt
where Norton bought it.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.620
Three karats,
grade "E," flawless,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.355
- one minor occlusion.
- Track it?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.791
Uh, well, we got a BOLO
out on the stone right now,

06:54.815 --> 06:56.626
and McCadden is, uh,
checking with local fences.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.345
That's good work, DiNozzo.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.964
You heard me.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.046
Gibbs.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.368
Your mother-in-law
is waiting for you

07:05.392 --> 07:06.502
in the conference room.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.104
I'd like to speak
to you afterward.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.722
Did you come all the way down
here to tell me that, Director?

07:11.998 --> 07:14.644
Ziva, that sketch artist comes,
you send her up.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.978
McGee, find that weapon.
DiNozzo...

07:16.002 --> 07:17.437
Working on that ring, boss.

07:18.738 --> 07:19.782
Yeah, big-time.

07:19.806 --> 07:21.274
He complimented me twice.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.286
Very un-Gibbs.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.488
We better keep
an eye on that guy.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.923
Don't you agree, Director?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.659
Is that your decision,
Agent DiNozzo?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.394
It's not mine to make, sir.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.080
You got that right.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.658
Thank you.

07:44.664 --> 07:48.657
Still drinking
the same old swill, I see.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.448
Keeps my engine running.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.269
How is your father, Jethro?

07:55.308 --> 07:58.087
He's stubborn.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.756
I guess that's a good thing.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.693
How's Mac?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.127
Mac and I divorced

08:05.151 --> 08:08.497
about two years
after it happened.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.166
Rough.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.434
On everybody.

08:11.458 --> 08:15.605
It was never, ever the same
after we lost the girls.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.063
How about you?

08:20.233 --> 08:24.013
You know, you didn't have
to go through this alone.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.848
Oh, I called, Joann.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.016
You never called me back.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.203
That is not exactly
how I remember it.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.682
What happened last night?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.328
Joe took me
to a retirement party

08:39.352 --> 08:41.429
for a friend of ours.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.032
Navy admiral.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.068
And then he wanted
to walk down by the water.

08:46.092 --> 08:50.806
He said that... he wanted
to ask me something.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.661
He proposed to you.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.178
Yes.

08:56.202 --> 09:00.650
I was looking
at the ring on my finger

09:00.674 --> 09:05.354
when this...
this stranger walked up.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.156
Pulled his gun out.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.525
What'd he look like?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.662
He was white, in his 20s.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.832
Joe just went
for that gun... so fast.

09:16.856 --> 09:20.336
I screamed at him
and I begged him not to do it.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.129
I wanted to help, but I...

09:26.566 --> 09:27.643
Excuse me.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.567
The, uh, sketch artist is here.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.784
You okay to do this?

09:34.808 --> 09:38.938
I want to do anything to help.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.537
This won't take long.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.038
I'll be the judge of that.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.440
Protocol.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.165
I am related to the victim.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.980
S.O.P. is for you
to ask me to step aside.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.648
Okay, I'm asking.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.116
Okay, I'm declining.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.951
She was Shannon's mother.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.319
This is another violent crime.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.654
It has to affect you.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.590
Leon, we've all lost people.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.992
It was a long time ago.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.160
Don't give me that B.S., Gibbs.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.595
I know what pushes your buttons.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.280
This could be a problem.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.369
Okay, off the record.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.826
Okay, try me.

10:29.863 --> 10:33.009
I need to do this for Shannon.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.627
She would have wanted it.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.854
Okay.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.490
But if your judgment comes
into question even once...

10:47.514 --> 10:48.924
I'll take myself off the case.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.916
No. I will.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.840
We've already decided.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.776
You've already decided.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.878
I don't have a choice, Shannon.
I'm a marine.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.446
- It's my job.
- You're not thinking

11:10.470 --> 11:12.114
about this family.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.316
You knew they wanted
to transfer you.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.619
- It's not my decision.
- Mom, don't.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.221
He's taking
my girls away from me.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.390
I made a commitment.
I have to honor it.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.017
Don't you do this. Please!

11:30.757 --> 11:32.168
Sorry, boss.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.355
Uh... Detective McCadden
is here.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.657
You need anything?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.398
You to, uh, to leave.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.839
Right.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.088
Looks like everything's here.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.355
What can we do
for you, Detective?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.057
Witness statements.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.392
Gibbs signed off on 'em.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.561
- They're fine.
- You sure about that?

11:58.585 --> 12:00.863
Play nice, kiddies,
plenty of room in the sandbox.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.198
Joann Fielding told us

12:02.222 --> 12:04.166
the same thing she told you.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.802
Had the ring on
when they were robbed.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.521
You look at her fingers?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.906
Arthritis.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.898
Try getting
a size four ring on there.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.413
- What size are you, David?
- She wouldn't know that.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.703
Five... every girl knows
her ring size, just in case.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.186
Joann said she was wearing it.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.355
You do a gunshot residue test?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.057
Got to be a false positive.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.959
Ms. Fielding was
within a foot of the shots

12:29.983 --> 12:30.960
that killed her fiancé,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.128
She'd be covered

12:32.152 --> 12:34.697
in cordite and sulfur
from the discharge.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.865
Test would be useless.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.880
Maybe. Maybe not.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.402
All right,
sketch artist finished.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.238
Downloading the drawing.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.806
You guys need help
with the BOLOs?

12:43.830 --> 12:46.208
Oh, no, I think
we've got it covered, Phil.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.409
After you.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.078
All right, what we are doing

12:49.102 --> 12:51.046
is running the composite
through facial recognition,

12:51.070 --> 12:52.435
known felons first.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.051
You're already getting hits?

12:56.075 --> 12:57.119
Get out of here, McCadden.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.474
Happy to.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.464
Who is this?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.533
I told you before.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.402
This is the man
that I remember from last night.

13:13.426 --> 13:17.072
That's the man
who killed Joseph.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.073
The hell it is.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.542
Oh, Jethro, what do you know?

13:19.566 --> 13:20.609
You weren't even there.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.578
That's not him.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.946
I know what I saw.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.016
Joann, that's Kyle Buckley.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.851
Remember Kyle Buckley?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.086
I went to high school
with Kyle Buckley.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.613
This is the face that I saw.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.825
I remember very clearly.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.494
Yeah, so do I.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.163
Kyle Buckley died
in a car accident

13:41.187 --> 13:42.677
three years ago.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.170
I understand
that this is hard on you,

13:48.194 --> 13:51.073
so I'm gonna ask you again.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.965
Did you see the guy
who did this or not?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.125
All right, here we go.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.160
Sorry about that.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.229
I drive a little bit
like a maniac.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.396
Thank you.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.565
- This is a nice place you got here.
- Yes.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.968
Yeah. I bet you have some view.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.437
Mm! That sea air!

14:21.461 --> 14:22.938
Uh, do you need me
to walk you up?

14:22.962 --> 14:24.640
Oh, no, no, no, I'm-I'm fine.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.275
I just need to get
a little rest.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.810
Okay, well,

14:27.834 --> 14:31.814
some warm milk, hot bath...
and you'll be fine in no time.

14:31.838 --> 14:36.118
Well, I can tell you're
a good man, Agent DiNozzo.

14:36.142 --> 14:39.421
Jethro doesn't trust
many people.

14:39.445 --> 14:42.591
Well, i-if you don't mind
my asking,

14:42.615 --> 14:45.060
I'm just a little
curious about...

14:45.084 --> 14:46.829
Jethro.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.789
What was he like
when he was young?

14:51.858 --> 14:55.471
You know, I don't think
I ever really understood Jethro.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.840
I always liked him a lot.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.742
I was very happy when

14:59.766 --> 15:01.944
he and Shannon got married.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.129
We made a very nice family.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.599
Then everything changed.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.922
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to drag all this to the surface.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.506
Oh, trust me. He'll be fine.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.149
Thanks, Tony.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.335
Boss.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.038
We retrieved Captain Norton's
laptop and a few cell phones

15:29.062 --> 15:31.206
from his apartment;
Two of them were burn phones.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.509
Why would a career
navy captain need a burn phone?

15:33.533 --> 15:34.677
Keep talking.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.011
Cells were purchased in Arizona

15:36.035 --> 15:37.880
and used when Norton
was still assigned

15:37.904 --> 15:41.750
to a carrier battle group
operating in SOUTHCOM's AOR.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.686
South American
aircraft carriers.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.387
Before his transfer to Norfolk.

15:45.411 --> 15:46.555
Who was he calling?

15:46.579 --> 15:48.157
Oh, mostly, uh, Nogales.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.191
It's a border town,

15:49.215 --> 15:51.360
half on the U.S. side,
half in Mexico.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.495
According to the DEA,
a major drug smuggling point

15:53.519 --> 15:54.963
for the Reynosa Cartel.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.398
- Laptop?
- Cracked it.

15:56.422 --> 15:57.566
Three different
Zurich bank accounts

15:57.590 --> 15:59.735
dating back almost 20 years,

15:59.759 --> 16:02.071
all of them dormant since Norton
transferred to Virginia.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.373
Looks like our captain
was involved

16:04.397 --> 16:06.075
- in the drug trade, boss.
- Ten million bucks.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.643
Tidy little nest egg,

16:07.667 --> 16:09.812
but, uh, Captain must have
bailed on the drug business.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.313
Why?

16:11.337 --> 16:14.249
Because he's not taking navy
trips to South America anymore.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.651
Cartel connections.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.053
Ten years of encrypted
e-mails from Mexico.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.389
I don't understand how Norton
smuggled drugs out of there

16:20.413 --> 16:23.025
when our ships never drop anchor
in Mexican ports.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.914
Maybe somebody wanted
their money back.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.873
You, uh, smelling for the scent
of almonds, Doctor?

16:37.897 --> 16:40.376
Perhaps these, uh, bullet tips
were laced with cyanide.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.444
It's your cologne, Mr. Palmer.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.446
It is absolutely wretched.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.116
Well, I... I'm just test-driving
one for my big date.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.852
I'm also trying out
disposable contact lenses.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.187
Well, change is good,
Mr. Palmer.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.590
As long as you are
the motivation

16:54.614 --> 16:55.824
for the change.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.617
Smells like a French whorehouse
in here.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.896
Uh, that-that's me.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.465
What are you trying to do,
Palmer, raise the dead?

17:03.489 --> 17:06.167
Would you take these up
to Ms. Sciuto right away?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.838
And, uh, then use
the Hazmat shower.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.160
Yeah, use it twice.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.178
I do hope he doesn't end up
with a broken one of these.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.579
Yes, what I believe

17:17.603 --> 17:21.250
is the kill shot entered
the lower left ventricle.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.018
It traveled
in an upward direction,

17:23.041 --> 17:26.355
caused a severe aortic rupture.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.824
But that's not why
I called you down here.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.628
His entire gastronomic tract
is inflamed.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.863
Yes, this is the handiwork
of leishmaniasis.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.966
In this case,
visceral leishmaniasis.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.370
It's a parasite you get
from infected sand flies,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.839
found mostly
in Third World countries.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.073
Like Mexico?

17:45.097 --> 17:46.462
Possibly.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.048
Cool, huh?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.283
It's like a carnival.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.517
If you hit the target,

17:55.541 --> 17:58.887
you could win a stuffed animal.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.956
I don't like
stuffed animals much.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.791
What do you got, Abbs?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.806
Spatter patterns
from Joann's coat.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.398
Doesn't match.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.799
I don't think she was standing

18:10.823 --> 18:12.968
where she said she was standing
when the captain was killed.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.471
As a matter of fact,
I know she wasn't.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.073
I mean, maybe... maybe
she got it wrong.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.909
Or she had some sort of post-
traumatic stress disorientation.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.778
Maybe, but what blood came
from spatter

18:22.802 --> 18:23.979
and what was transferred?

18:24.003 --> 18:27.249
If she was standing
behind the captain

18:27.273 --> 18:30.219
when he was struggling with the
killer, then the blood spatter

18:30.243 --> 18:32.187
would be here
on her left front shoulder

18:32.211 --> 18:34.923
from this exit wound.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.282
There's nothing there.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.595
Jackpot!

18:39.619 --> 18:41.211
It's Major Mass Spec calling.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.835
I love this machine.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.770
If Major Mass Spec were a guy,

18:48.794 --> 18:50.105
I would totally marry him

18:50.129 --> 18:52.241
and bear his little
mini-mass children.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.877
Abby, what am I looking at?

18:54.901 --> 18:57.145
The results from Joann
Fielding's fingernail scrapings.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.413
I've never found this much

18:58.437 --> 19:00.015
under a living victim's
fingernails before.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.618
It's 100% worsted wool fiber

19:02.642 --> 19:03.852
with a Scotchgard coating.

19:03.876 --> 19:04.920
It was manufactured
in Denton, New Hampshire.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.422
Navy peacoat?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.224
Government issue.

19:09.248 --> 19:12.060
But this one has minute traces
of after-burned kerosene,

19:12.084 --> 19:14.730
sea foam, and aspirated
JP-5 aircraft fuel

19:14.754 --> 19:16.098
embedded in the surface.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.800
Sailor on the deck
of an aircraft carrier?

19:18.824 --> 19:20.736
On the flight deck
during takeoff.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.204
Okay, flight crew.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.972
That narrows down
your suspect list

19:23.996 --> 19:26.475
from a few million
to like 7,000.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.010
Well, that doesn't
help much, Abbs.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.479
I'm not going to leave you
with a "doesn't help much."

19:30.503 --> 19:33.472
These fibers are specifically
from epaulets.

19:35.274 --> 19:36.618
Peacoats don't have epaulets.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.634
Officer bridge coats do.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.011
Beautiful morning.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.619
Member of my own family
has been lying to me.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.677
Your story doesn't add up.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.693
Well, maybe your math is wrong.

20:05.938 --> 20:09.418
Listen, the man I loved
just died in my arms.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.420
What the hell do
you want from me?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.422
Respect.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.924
A little honesty maybe.

20:15.948 --> 20:19.261
I've always given you respect.

20:19.285 --> 20:22.864
When, uh, Shannon was alive...
maybe.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.867
In my family,
you have to earn it.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.725
When those girls died,
you did nothing.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.611
Did you know
that Joe Norton dealt drugs?

20:35.635 --> 20:37.613
That's ridiculous.

20:37.637 --> 20:38.780
I can prove it.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.382
I loved him. I knew him.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.451
How well did you know him?

20:42.475 --> 20:44.953
You know he had millions
in the bank?

20:44.977 --> 20:48.123
Drug money from his dealings
with the Reynosa cartel...

20:48.147 --> 20:49.625
the same men
who killed your daughter.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.693
Shut up.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.862
Shannon. Kelly.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.464
Mexico. Norton.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.615
They all have one thing
in common, Joann: You.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.702
You.

21:00.726 --> 21:04.406
You are the one
who took my family away from me.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.741
I'm a marine.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.576
I had orders.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.478
I didn't have a choice.
I had to go.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.747
Because of you, they're dead.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.650
I didn't kill them.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.653
But it was still
your responsibility.

21:17.677 --> 21:21.169
Why weren't you there
to take care of our girls?

21:24.383 --> 21:29.164
This is about the murder
of Joseph Norton, Joann.

21:29.188 --> 21:33.035
Well, go do
your damn job, Jethro.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.138
Nothing ever stopped you before.

21:36.162 --> 21:39.154
Nothing's going to stop you now.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.521
You want to learn about being
a real man, McGee,

21:52.545 --> 21:54.356
you got to study
the Japanese samurai.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.657
These guys are like Gibbs

21:55.681 --> 21:58.393
with even bigger stones
and less to say.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.028
Is that even possible?

22:00.052 --> 22:03.165
Hoo-ah! DiNozzo.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.599
- It's me, DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss?

22:04.623 --> 22:05.600
What are you doing?

22:05.624 --> 22:07.669
I was, I was just tracking down.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.261
Norton's deployment history.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.477
Yeah, we're... we're on it.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.745
Boss on his way back?

22:16.769 --> 22:17.746
Stop what you're doing.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.880
Why?

22:18.904 --> 22:21.216
He wants us to check
some phone records.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.884
On Norton's burn phones?

22:22.908 --> 22:24.486
No, Joann Fielding.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.889
Financial accounts, too.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.958
Any calls to Mexico?

22:29.982 --> 22:31.660
Uh, I went back five years.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.061
Nothing out of the ordinary,

22:33.085 --> 22:35.897
except there were plenty
of calls to Nogales, Arizona,

22:35.921 --> 22:37.365
the U.S. side.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.400
Who?

22:38.424 --> 22:40.502
Only one number.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.771
Let me throw it up
on the plasma here.

22:42.795 --> 22:46.675
Joann called Martin Hendricks,
a retired P.D.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.510
listed as
"Locator of Missing Persons."

22:48.534 --> 22:50.145
Joann's looking for somebody.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.546
Based on old checking
account statements,

22:51.570 --> 22:53.615
she was paying this guy
on and off for almost two years,

22:53.639 --> 22:55.817
both in the U.S.
and across the border.

22:55.841 --> 22:56.985
Hendricks is not cheap,

22:57.009 --> 22:59.154
but he does claim
a 98% success rate.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.013
How much she spend?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.593
Almost $28,000.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.629
DiNozzo, get Ziva, head on down
to Arizona and talk to him.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.431
Arizona?

23:09.455 --> 23:11.032
Do I have to?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.467
You know, my grandfather retired
to Arizona.

23:12.491 --> 23:13.549
It's a dry heat.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.403
Oh, my God!

23:27.239 --> 23:28.350
Aren't you hot?

23:28.374 --> 23:29.885
I've been told that before.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.853
I'm talking about temperature.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.722
Okay, stop complaining.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.457
This is what winter
feels like in Israel.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.325
Well, we're not in Israel.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.894
We're in the good old
U.S. of A.,

23:38.918 --> 23:39.995
my little immigrant friend,

23:40.019 --> 23:41.263
where we like to embrace

23:41.287 --> 23:44.518
central air, not melanoma.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.148
I'm gonna knock.

23:49.328 --> 23:50.672
Mr. Hendricks, NCIS.

23:50.696 --> 23:53.975
Federal agents.
We need to talk with you.

23:53.999 --> 23:56.611
Something has been broken off
inside the lock.

23:56.635 --> 23:59.247
- Well, maybe it's the key.
- No, a nail.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.849
Someone did not want
anyone entering.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.652
Something's not right.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.686
I'm going in.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.046
We're going in.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.879
This guy Hendricks
knows how to live.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.818
Or not.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.385
It's like
a homemade toaster oven.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.074
Guess we found Hendricks.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.410
Well done.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.644
Thanks.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.226
Not you. Him.

24:49.988 --> 24:54.468
You hired a retired cop
in Arizona to work for you.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.805
This is your file.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.694
How is Mr. Hendricks?

25:03.836 --> 25:06.648
Oh, my God.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.537
What happened?

25:10.376 --> 25:12.220
It's just us.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.336
There's no video.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.513
Talk to me.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.094
He's dead.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.896
You connect the dots.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.965
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:23.989 --> 25:27.435
You spent $28,000
looking for someone

25:27.459 --> 25:29.137
who spent a lot
of time in Mexico.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.138
Who was that? Norton?

25:30.162 --> 25:31.239
Yes.

25:31.263 --> 25:35.043
I met him in Baja
when I was on vacation.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.212
Then we came back,
I lost his number,

25:37.236 --> 25:41.716
so I, uh, I hired
Mr. Hendricks to find him.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.619
You took out a bank loan
to go on a second date?

25:44.643 --> 25:48.123
Don't patronize me, Jethro.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.458
You see the trail
you're leaving?

25:50.482 --> 25:52.727
People are dead.

25:52.751 --> 25:55.063
Dangerous drug dealers
are connected.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.099
And you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.802
I am the victim here.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.237
This situation

26:02.261 --> 26:04.072
has got your name
written all over it.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.840
I don't know exactly
what you did

26:05.864 --> 26:07.042
or why you did it,

26:07.066 --> 26:10.912
but because of Shannon...

26:10.936 --> 26:12.948
I'll give you a chance.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.463
Do you want my help
or don't you?

26:22.548 --> 26:24.379
Good luck.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.035
It's open.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.984
You called, Mr. Gibbs?

26:49.008 --> 26:51.653
You want a beer?

26:51.677 --> 26:53.989
Yeah, if you have
a slice of cold pizza

26:54.013 --> 26:55.056
to go with it.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.749
I think I can handle that.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.229
Crazy day at the office.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.965
Amazing how people keep suing
each other

27:03.989 --> 27:07.102
even in the... worst economy
in years.

27:07.126 --> 27:10.171
Yeah? Better than them
killing each other.

27:10.195 --> 27:13.174
Oh, they do that, too,

27:13.198 --> 27:14.222
when they lose.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.602
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.983
So what's this about?

27:22.007 --> 27:24.452
You made it sound important.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.653
It is.

27:25.677 --> 27:27.522
You still do pro bono work?

27:27.546 --> 27:30.458
If the price is right.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.074
Yeah.

27:33.986 --> 27:37.365
I have someone who...
might need your help.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.152
Who is it?

27:41.193 --> 27:43.171
My former mother-in-law.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.830
You're kidding.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.889
No.

27:49.368 --> 27:53.715
And if anybody asks,
we never talked.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.717
You okay with that?

27:55.741 --> 27:59.554
Representing
your ex-mother-in-law?

27:59.578 --> 28:02.824
"Okay" might be
the wrong description.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.692
"Conflicted," maybe.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.161
All right.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.164
Turn out the lights
when you leave.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.452
This may be the worst date
I've ever had.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.704
Love is but a sweet
embrace, a whispered phrase,

28:16.728 --> 28:17.839
a graceful face.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.140
Is that Tennyson?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.842
No, no, Mallard.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.779
There was a poetry competition
in school when I was 15.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.548
I took second place.

28:26.572 --> 28:27.849
Very romantic.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.051
I'm trying to put you
in the mood, Mr. Palmer.

28:30.075 --> 28:32.854
It's a pity your embalmer friend
isn't here to see this.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.189
It's very unusual.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.624
Can I bring her after our date?

28:36.648 --> 28:38.093
No.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.394
What'd he die of?

28:39.418 --> 28:41.943
A dry wit.

28:43.288 --> 28:44.933
I am sorry.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.402
He was baked to death.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.737
The bindings that were around
his wrists and ankles

28:49.761 --> 28:53.208
were there simply
to hold him in place.

28:53.232 --> 28:57.612
Extreme thirst can be
a significantly painful death.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.913
Mexican cartels.

28:58.937 --> 29:02.484
Yes, they're
a little more public

29:02.508 --> 29:04.119
with their executions,
and certainly more bloody.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.553
What are you thinking?

29:05.577 --> 29:09.114
I'm thinking that they made
an exception in this case.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.626
What do you got, McGee?

29:11.650 --> 29:13.795
Boss, Norfolk Sanitation
just found Norton's phone

29:13.819 --> 29:15.830
from the other night
in a marina Dumpster.

29:15.854 --> 29:16.998
Somebody tossed it.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.032
You find anything?

29:18.056 --> 29:19.167
Uh, possibly.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.002
There were two calls
earlier that day

29:21.026 --> 29:23.738
to the same local number,
a Lieutenant David Shankton.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.507
According to the VFTP database,

29:25.531 --> 29:28.309
Shankton owns the same make
and model handgun

29:28.333 --> 29:30.111
that was used
to kill Captain Norton.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.814
I can't believe he's dead.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.950
I just saw him at the admiral's
retirement dinner.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.888
How well you know
Captain Norton?

29:39.912 --> 29:42.290
I've served under him
at the Supply Center

29:42.314 --> 29:43.525
for the past four years.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.493
Before that?

29:45.517 --> 29:49.297
We met in the Yucatán
down in Mexico

29:49.321 --> 29:50.665
over a decade ago.

29:50.689 --> 29:54.702
You and the captain
margarita amigos?

29:54.726 --> 29:56.538
No, sir,

29:56.562 --> 29:58.640
nothing like that.

29:58.664 --> 29:59.941
Before I joined the service,

29:59.965 --> 30:01.509
I worked fishing charters.
That's how we met.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.479
Captain Norton inspired me
to join the navy.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.481
Hmm, it's a touching story.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.183
You know, we, uh, compared.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.551
Norton's credit card statements
to yours,

30:09.575 --> 30:10.818
and you know what we found?

30:10.842 --> 30:13.788
You guys were both
in the same town

30:13.812 --> 30:16.858
at the same time in Mexico
18 different times.

30:16.882 --> 30:19.194
It's a popular place.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.529
Yeah, Gulf and Reynosa cartels
smuggle a lot of drugs

30:21.553 --> 30:23.064
out of the Yucatán.
You know that?

30:23.088 --> 30:24.866
So what's your point?

30:24.890 --> 30:28.336
Do you own a nine-millimeter,
Lieutenant?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.572
I did.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.827
Somebody stole it from my house
about a month ago.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.612
I'm sorry.
What the heck is going on here?

30:37.636 --> 30:39.480
We think you two
had a little partnership.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.382
That's what we think
is going on.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.218
Cartel gives you the drugs.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.852
You have a little rendezvous
with Norton,

30:44.876 --> 30:46.721
and then he brings 'em back
to Norfolk, except...

30:46.745 --> 30:49.873
he wasn't really sharing
the wealth, was he?

30:52.951 --> 30:54.362
I didn't kill anybody.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.030
You talked to him yesterday.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.166
You knew he'd be at the party,

30:58.190 --> 31:00.852
knew that he was gonna
propose to Joann.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.440
Do you mind if I just
take a look at this?

31:05.464 --> 31:09.377
If the fibers match,
it puts you at the murder scene.

31:09.401 --> 31:13.648
Somebody's trying to frame me,
all right?

31:13.672 --> 31:16.918
Well, if they are, they're
doing a pretty good job of it.

31:16.942 --> 31:19.240
Get the sample to Abby.

31:22.447 --> 31:25.193
Then get over to Joann's.
Keep an eye on her.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.561
Boss, this is our guy.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.850
Okay, samples to Abby... on it.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.610
Well, if it isn't
M. Allison Hart.

31:42.634 --> 31:43.711
Agent DiNozzo.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.080
You two know each other?

31:46.104 --> 31:47.749
Ms. Fielding is my client.

31:47.773 --> 31:50.585
Oh. Well, you get around.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.453
She doesn't feel safe here.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.389
You all right, Joann?

31:54.413 --> 31:57.712
Yes, Tony. I'll be just fine.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.301
She's been through
a very difficult loss

32:06.325 --> 32:08.770
and your investigation
isn't making things

32:08.794 --> 32:09.904
any easier for her.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.939
Well, I'm sorry. Now listen,

32:11.963 --> 32:16.277
do you think I could have a word
with your client for a second?

32:16.301 --> 32:18.379
No.

32:18.403 --> 32:21.702
Anything you have to say to her,
you can now say to me.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.909
Good night, Agent DiNozzo.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.403
This an intervention?

32:42.427 --> 32:44.327
Told me there were cocktails.

32:46.031 --> 32:49.077
You're holding Lieutenant
Shankton for Norton's murder.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.478
Yeah.

32:50.502 --> 32:51.846
So you think he did it?

32:51.870 --> 32:54.615
Maybe.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.917
Then why are you holding him?

32:55.941 --> 32:57.318
Evidence says he did it.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.354
He had a similar weapon,
had motive.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.922
Plus, he's the only connection

33:00.946 --> 33:05.193
we have to the Reynosa cartel,
and I want him.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.663
Joann Fielding knew Lieutenant
Shankton through her fiancé.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.131
Yeah, and?

33:10.155 --> 33:12.367
Well, you must know she spent
time at Shankton's house.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.235
We think she set him up.

33:14.259 --> 33:15.870
Both men link
to the same drug cartel

33:15.894 --> 33:19.440
responsible for Shannon
and Kelly's deaths.

33:19.464 --> 33:20.908
Really, Leon?

33:20.932 --> 33:23.845
That makes her awfully clever.

33:23.869 --> 33:26.814
My mother-in-law the vigilante.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.783
Go ahead, Gibbs, cross it.

33:28.807 --> 33:29.984
Try me.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.486
I'm just doing my job.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.354
- So am I.
- You want me to step out?

33:33.378 --> 33:34.389
No.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.757
Remember, I said

33:35.781 --> 33:38.226
if your judgment should come
into question even once...

33:38.250 --> 33:40.294
I'll take myself off this case.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.081
Will you be able to do it?

33:43.637 --> 33:45.366
Arrest her?

33:57.235 --> 34:01.315
With the new information
from Abby's report,

34:01.339 --> 34:02.683
I decided to take another look.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.884
Three slugs.

34:03.908 --> 34:06.520
One lodged itself
in Norton's spine,

34:06.544 --> 34:10.123
the other two passed
right through... bilaterally.

34:10.148 --> 34:12.672
However...

34:15.219 --> 34:19.132
Joann... could not have been
behind Norton

34:19.157 --> 34:21.467
when he tried
to disarm his attacker.

34:21.492 --> 34:25.839
There's no way she was
on the side of the exit wound.

34:25.862 --> 34:31.678
The actual blood spatter on her
was low down around the waist.

34:31.702 --> 34:37.751
She had to have been
in front of him and facing him.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.254
I'm sorry, but...

34:40.277 --> 34:43.907
she fired the shots herself,
Jethro.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.851
I'm sure of it.

34:48.853 --> 34:52.533
I need to talk to her... alone.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.467
No.

34:54.492 --> 34:56.937
No?

34:56.960 --> 34:59.173
She's my client now.

34:59.197 --> 35:00.541
You're lead
on the investigation.

35:00.565 --> 35:01.975
That can work
against her best interests.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.611
She's your client
because I asked you.

35:04.635 --> 35:05.913
Was your mistake.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.083
By the way, you're out of beer.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.517
Could you please get
some light beer?

35:10.541 --> 35:12.820
This crap you drink...
ooh, it's doing a number on me.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.088
She's family.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.410
I need to talk to her.

35:21.385 --> 35:23.464
I'll advise my client
against it,

35:23.488 --> 35:26.023
but it's up to her.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.724
What are you up to, Mr. Gibbs?

35:33.865 --> 35:37.426
You have been defending
guilty people for too long.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.781
As long as we battle each other

35:40.805 --> 35:43.467
and somebody wins,
I have done my job.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.308
And that's okay with you?

35:54.619 --> 35:56.830
You really want to talk to her?

35:56.854 --> 35:59.299
Yeah.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.814
I want some answers.
I want the truth.

36:03.861 --> 36:05.863
Law school 101.

36:07.865 --> 36:09.196
Truth's overrated.

36:13.538 --> 36:17.030
Is this your personal
torture chamber?

36:19.076 --> 36:21.943
The only person ever tortured
down here is me.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.175
Thank you.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.714
I know everything, Joann.

36:37.061 --> 36:39.439
You knew that you couldn't get

36:39.463 --> 36:43.110
Shannon and Kelly's
real killers,

36:43.134 --> 36:45.679
and so you went after Norton.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.604
Guilty by association.

36:51.676 --> 36:52.870
We're not doing this.

36:55.413 --> 36:56.505
Sit.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.928
That ex-cop you hired

37:00.952 --> 37:03.997
to go to Arizona
to look for Norton,

37:04.021 --> 37:08.202
the Reynosa cartel... they knew
he was snooping around

37:08.226 --> 37:09.836
and they killed him.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.630
So you found Norton...

37:13.731 --> 37:16.510
you did,
and you charmed him and...

37:16.534 --> 37:18.345
you killed one man
and you framed another,

37:18.369 --> 37:22.931
and you... planned it all
like a pro.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.478
Really, are you that smart?

37:29.947 --> 37:34.761
I'm just a mother who lost
everything she loved.

37:34.785 --> 37:39.399
Shannon and Kelly...

37:39.423 --> 37:41.948
Norton didn't kill 'em.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.518
But I know who did.

38:06.083 --> 38:09.814
How'd it feel, hmm?

38:11.622 --> 38:13.988
Satisfying?

38:17.828 --> 38:19.955
Oh, Jethro.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.712
The night that he proposed,

38:25.736 --> 38:29.082
he was holding me in his arms.

38:29.106 --> 38:35.422
I whispered our girls' names
in his ear.

38:35.446 --> 38:38.191
Then I pulled the trigger

38:38.215 --> 38:43.175
one, two, three times...

38:44.188 --> 38:46.952
and I watched him die.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.022
Nobody ever need know.

38:58.402 --> 39:03.931
You and I both did
what we did... for them.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.897
You are under arrest
for the murder

39:16.921 --> 39:22.302
of Captain Joseph Norton,
for tampering with evidence,

39:22.326 --> 39:24.404
for interfering
with a criminal investigation.

39:24.428 --> 39:26.073
Mr. Gibbs,

39:26.097 --> 39:30.677
you just arrested my client
illegally and unlawfully.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.480
You interrogated her
without proper citation

39:33.504 --> 39:34.915
of her Miranda rights,

39:34.939 --> 39:37.484
and you coerced a confession.

39:37.508 --> 39:40.487
If you don't release
her right away,

39:40.511 --> 39:43.173
I will pursue legal action.

39:47.184 --> 39:49.311
The case'll never stick, right?

39:51.355 --> 39:53.721
You just made
a very big mistake.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.840
Yeah.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.842
You won.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.578
Did I?

40:04.602 --> 40:06.627
Take care of yourself, Joann.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.842
You, too, Jethro.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.894
Quiet. Here he comes.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.721
Abby, uh...

40:47.745 --> 40:50.557
matched the fibers
from Shankton's coat.

40:50.581 --> 40:53.393
He had the means,
the opportunity,

40:53.417 --> 40:55.729
about $10 million worth
of motive.

40:55.753 --> 40:58.398
Lieutenant's a drug dealer.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.413
He deserves to do time.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.571
Boss, what about
your mother-in-law?

41:04.595 --> 41:09.576
Joann Fielding
is no longer a suspect

41:09.600 --> 41:12.091
or a person of interest
in this investigation.

41:13.871 --> 41:16.883
Great. Can we go home now?

41:16.907 --> 41:18.151
Yeah.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.369
Yeah, good night.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.635
If I hurry,
maybe I can catch Rashomon.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.804
Hey, guys, guys.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.973
Breena, these are my coworkers.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.999
Everyone, this is Breena.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.745
Life isn't fair.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.314
Hey, guys, pleasure to meet you.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.649
Ziva, McGee, and...

41:49.673 --> 41:50.884
Tony, right?

41:50.908 --> 41:52.719
I described you.

41:52.743 --> 41:55.088
Apparently,
the details were accurate.

41:55.112 --> 41:56.289
She has a photographic memory.

41:56.313 --> 41:59.593
Jimmy loves me for my mind.

41:59.617 --> 42:02.415
Isn't he the cutest thing ever?

42:03.354 --> 42:05.189
Yeah.
