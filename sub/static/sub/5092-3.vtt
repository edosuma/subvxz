WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.237
(gunfire,
shell casings clinking)

00:12.680 --> 00:15.083
Better not go shooting
with your brothers anymore.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.550
You'll show 'em up.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.387
They need to be put in their
place from time to time.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.723
Still out-shoot us all, though.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.293
Well, targets don't shoot back.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.329
You miss the job, don't you?

00:29.730 --> 00:33.634
What I probably miss is the idea
of it, not the reality.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.570
So, rumor has it,

00:36.604 --> 00:39.173
you're getting out more often.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.841
You seeing anybody?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.376
Who ratted me out?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.078
I have my sources.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.279
Mm-hmm.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.414
Nicky?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.449
She doesn't want her mom
to be lonely.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.619
The only time I
felt lonely is

00:51.652 --> 00:53.821
when I was married
to her father.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.538
And how is your ex-husband?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.140
(laughing)

01:15.476 --> 01:16.610
(subway cars clacking
on tracks)

01:20.781 --> 01:23.551
What's the matter,
you nervous?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.854
I been through worse than this.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.622
MAN:
Yeah, right.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.224
MAN 2:
Nervous is fine.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.792
Keeps you on your toes.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.395
But if you're scared,
we have a problem.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.599
Let's go.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.544
All right, before we hit
the streets, let's say hi

01:50.578 --> 01:52.546
to our new cop here,

01:52.580 --> 01:57.385
Officer Luisa Sosa, who made
72 collars her rookie year.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.420
I guess that could
even be a new record.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.489
It is.
Well, there
you have it.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.258
She joins us from the 2-9.
How about it?

02:04.292 --> 02:07.495
(applause and cheering)

02:07.528 --> 02:10.364
Okay, be careful
out there today.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.532
MAN:
Let's do it.
(banging on podium)

02:11.565 --> 02:13.701
All right?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.703
Oh, hey, Reagan,
little change in plans.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.438
You ride with Sosa.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.540
You guys are running
Bingo Bags today.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.509
Reagan, nice to see you.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.476
How you doing?

02:22.510 --> 02:23.844
What? You two know
each other.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.213
Academy.
Academy.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.814
Nice. A reunion.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.516
You can work together
and catch up.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.451
I want you both
in plain clothes.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.820
And you get her up to
speed, okay, college boy?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.189
Okay, you got it, Sarge.
All right.

02:35.223 --> 02:38.826
So, how's married life
with the Harvard honey?

02:38.859 --> 02:41.229
Oh, it didn't quite have
the fairy-tale ending.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.530
Count your blessings.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.564
Oh.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.632
Well, that's two surprises.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.833
I'm single. What else?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.635
You're still in the bag.
I figured Daddy

02:47.668 --> 02:49.570
would have you commanding
a detective squad by now.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.571
Uh, I turned it down,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.540
hoping to work Bingo Bags
with you someday.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.375
Well, I'm glad
that worked out for you.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.909
Mm-hmm.
So, what's Bingo Bags?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
A great way
to ruin somebody's day.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.548
Come on, let's get changed.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.819
(quiet whimpering, crying)

03:05.853 --> 03:07.555
MAN:
Shh...

03:18.666 --> 03:20.634
People...
(hostages gasping)

03:20.668 --> 03:23.237
...just need
a few more minutes of your time.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.239
Then we'll be out of your lives.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.576
Anybody moves, it'll be the last
thing you do on this earth.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.346
You got something
you want to say, Rabbi?

03:32.380 --> 03:34.548
WOMAN:
Do as he says!

03:52.500 --> 03:53.567
Hey.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.768
Almost done back there?

03:54.802 --> 03:56.337
I'm coming. I'm coming!

03:57.605 --> 03:59.573
(grunts, people scream)

03:59.607 --> 04:02.310
(gasps)

04:05.646 --> 04:07.481
(people screaming)

04:09.350 --> 04:11.352
(groaning)

04:15.756 --> 04:17.758
(grunts)

04:18.759 --> 04:20.594
(murmuring)

04:20.628 --> 04:23.497
(excited chatter)

04:23.531 --> 04:25.433
(panting)

04:27.735 --> 04:29.737
(siren blaring)

04:31.539 --> 04:33.507
Help me.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.643
Somebody, please.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.449
(siren blaring,
tires squealing)

04:42.650 --> 04:44.652
(groaning)

04:47.921 --> 04:49.557
(sirens blaring)

04:49.590 --> 04:52.660
(gasping)

04:52.693 --> 04:53.527
(groaning)

04:53.561 --> 04:55.563
(sirens blaring)

05:19.820 --> 05:21.455
You have a briefing on the
new Impact Zone deployment,

05:21.489 --> 05:22.656
the Borough Presidents' meeting,

05:22.690 --> 05:24.124
and then your train
leaves for Washington.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.093
I have printed out
your remarks

05:26.126 --> 05:27.961
for the Senate hearing
on gun violence.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.863
Did the report come
in on the shooting

05:29.897 --> 05:30.964
out in Rockaway
last night?

05:30.998 --> 05:33.601
It'll be here for you to
review on the train to D.C.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.068
And DCPI
should be... here.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.070
(indistinct voices on TV)

05:37.104 --> 05:38.806
Another smiling face.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.474
We have a botched
bank robbery

05:40.508 --> 05:42.843
that's morphed
into a hostage situation.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.012
(sighs)

05:45.045 --> 05:47.548
Baker, cancel
the Washington trip.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.050
I can testify
some other time.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.985
It's a great
country, isn't it?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.154
A Mick flatfoot
from Brooklyn gets

05:54.187 --> 05:57.157
invited to stand before the
most august body in the land.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.058
And you weren't even subpoenaed.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.093
Thanks for the perspective.
What else?

06:00.127 --> 06:03.030
Danny caught the case.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.799
Garrett, it has been a decade

06:05.833 --> 06:08.736
since I was in the business
of assigning detectives.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.538
This is a tabloid city, Frank.
They'll make a meal of it.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.539
Then it's small potatoes.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.941
I have no control
over who gets these cases.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.175
They don't buy it.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.411
(sighs)

06:20.481 --> 06:22.149
(siren blaring)

06:22.182 --> 06:24.618
(garbled radio transmission)

06:24.652 --> 06:27.120
(indistinct shouting)

06:29.156 --> 06:31.425
(garbled radio transmission)

06:31.459 --> 06:33.861
OFFICER:
Yes, sir...

06:33.894 --> 06:36.096
(siren blaring)

06:36.129 --> 06:38.065
It's a real
junkie-with-a-note robbery.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.167
They compromised
the alarm system,

06:40.200 --> 06:41.835
they knocked out
the video feeds.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.837
Then they bypassed
the electronic vault lock.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.073
Have any idea how
big the crew is?
Three perps.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.075
According to witnesses,
two of them bolted.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.042
Their van is gone.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.444
One of them was shot.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.480
By who?
A customer.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.848
The bank manager says
it was a diamond dealer,

06:54.882 --> 06:56.116
licensed to carry.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.185
He in turn was shot
for his effort.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.453
Is he alive?

06:59.487 --> 07:02.189
Based on what witnesses say,
we believe so.
MAN: Hey, Captain.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.157
Hey, you know Jack Condo,
one of our negotiators?

07:04.191 --> 07:07.094
Hey.
Regular Dog Day Afternoon
here, huh?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.096
Oh, yeah.
Do you have
any information

07:09.129 --> 07:09.997
on the guy inside?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.232
No, nothing, Danny.
He's not responding.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.801
TARU's capturing
the phone lines,

07:13.834 --> 07:15.603
so if he calls out,
he's only gonna get us.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.770
We've got a
command center

07:16.804 --> 07:17.971
setting up out back.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.907
Meanwhile, we got the place
on lockdown,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.842
we got an entry team
ready to roll,

07:21.875 --> 07:23.143
snipers in position,

07:23.176 --> 07:24.244
ready to line up a shot.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.013
Yeah, unless I can
talk him out first.

07:26.046 --> 07:26.980
Either that,
or I lay him out.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.949
Okay, well,
while you two figure that out,

07:28.982 --> 07:29.983
we got two desperadoes

07:30.017 --> 07:31.785
running around town
with guns in their hands.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.754
Can you keep us posted
on any information

07:33.787 --> 07:34.955
you get from the inside?
It could help us

07:34.988 --> 07:36.123
find out who these guys are.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.257
Sure thing.
Thanks, guys.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.259
JACKIE:
Hey.
Hey.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.162
We, uh, got a description of
the van and a partial plate.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.263
Plus, check this out.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.633
Came from a security camera
on a building next door.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.502
With the masks and gloves on,
it's hard to make anything out.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.103
Is that a tattoo?
I think so.
If we blow it up,

07:50.137 --> 07:51.839
I'm sure we can
see what it says.

07:51.872 --> 07:52.973
All right, well,
let's try and get...

07:53.006 --> 07:53.974
WOMAN:
Help! Help!

07:54.007 --> 07:55.108
He's got a gun!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.276
He's got a gun!

07:56.309 --> 07:58.779
Come on.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.213
Hold it!
Hold it!

08:00.247 --> 08:01.582
There's blood everywhere!

08:01.615 --> 08:03.684
What's going on?
Come here. Come here.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.052
What's going on?
He's in the back.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.187
Okay.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.057
Where is he?
Where is he with the gun? Gun?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.092
Back. In back.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.132
(sighs)

08:19.166 --> 08:22.069
Well, now we're down
to hunting one mutt.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.771
Yeah. Well, he died
with a gun in his hands.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.938
His mother
will be proud.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.139
What, you know this guy?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.241
Yeah, Vinny Vario.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.342
He's from the West Side.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.144
He's been pulling heists
since he was ten years old.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.312
You know who
he works with?

08:32.345 --> 08:33.614
No, but I know somebody
who does.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.882
Why don't you sit tight here,

08:34.915 --> 08:36.149
feed me anything
that happens, all right?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.551
I'm gonna make a date.
Yeah.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.686
Wonderful.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.987
This is my date.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.197
This important?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.866
I got tickets
for the ballet.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.568
Bumped into a friend of yours.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.070
He looks like crap.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.939
Ooh.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.173
He actually looks
better dead.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.842
Yeah. He had a little mishap
at the bank.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.343
You have any idea
what he was up to?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.678
Who he was working with?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.079
He came to me
maybe two weeks ago,

09:06.113 --> 09:07.681
said he was looking
to put a crew together.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.249
Why'd he come to you?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.619
Wanted to talk me
out of retirement.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.086
Ah, and you don't give me
a heads up,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.221
let me know
something might be going down?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.256
Crime prevention is your
bailiwick, Detective, not mine.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.792
Ah.
And besides, I ain't
got no crystal ball.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.994
At least 20 jobs get planned
for every one that happens.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.329
Okay, all right.
Did any names come up?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.097
No, no names.
He did mention

09:24.131 --> 09:26.634
the guy that brought him the job
was new to the racket.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.836
You saying, Vario was working
with an amateur?

09:28.869 --> 09:29.937
That's the way
it sounded to me.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.739
Looks like that came back

09:31.772 --> 09:33.641
to bite him in the ass.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.942
(engine starting)

09:34.975 --> 09:37.144
You're welcome.
Yeah.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.946
(siren blaring,
garbled radio transmission)

09:47.420 --> 09:50.023
(phone ringing)

09:55.262 --> 09:57.264
(panting)

10:00.133 --> 10:01.268
You had to be a hero.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.671
(panting)

10:06.339 --> 10:08.241
Please, I need to
go to a hospital.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.977
Let me see.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.713
All right.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.115
Aren't you going
to answer that?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.184
(woman whimpering)

10:20.387 --> 10:22.756
Come out of there.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.157
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.159
(cries)
Come on.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.261
Please, I don't
want any trouble.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.863
(groaning)
Get over by him.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.365
He needs to go
to a hospital.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.701
What, are you a doctor
or a bank clerk?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.003
I dropped out
of nursing school.
Good.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.705
See what you can do for him.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.708
(man groaning,
phone ringing)

10:42.309 --> 10:43.744
CONDO:
Hey.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.445
Thanks for answering.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.446
Okay to go.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.948
I'm Jack.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.917
How's it going
in there, huh?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.319
We're, uh... we're getting ready
to play pinochle.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.220
CONDO:
Okay.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.989
Can I get you anything?
A deck of cards?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.157
How about, uh,

10:57.190 --> 10:59.693
five million in 20s
and a helicopter?

10:59.727 --> 11:02.329
Okay, so you want money
and transportation.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.196
So how's it go?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.465
Now you give me 20 bucks
and a skateboard

11:05.498 --> 11:07.701
and tell me you gave me
everything I asked for?

11:07.735 --> 11:10.170
Save it.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.305
Look, we have a
situation here.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.241
I'm just trying to
help you resolve it.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.810
At least tell me your name.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.715
Call me Ishmael.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.283
(dial tone)

11:23.316 --> 11:25.018
All right, now what?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.187
It's 98 in the
shade today.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.421
We turn off the
air-conditioning,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.858
decrease his
comfort level.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.492
Then I keep dialing.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.195
Last one of these
took 28 hours.

11:38.131 --> 11:42.302
So the decoy leaves a bag with
valuables in it on a bench,

11:42.335 --> 11:44.371
and if someone comes along
and takes it, we collar them

11:44.404 --> 11:45.505
for petit larceny?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.007
That's about it.
Theory is,

11:47.040 --> 11:48.075
people committing
smaller crimes

11:48.108 --> 11:49.476
also commit
the big ones

11:49.509 --> 11:50.410
or know people
who do.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.113
Yeah, broken windows,
blah, blah, blah.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.148
But I love it.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.516
Yeah, I figured
you would.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.086
You got a problem
with this, Reagan?

12:00.253 --> 12:02.823
Just that it's
borderline entrapment.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.892
Come on, you take something
that doesn't belong to you,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.059
you're a perp.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.961
Or did you miss that class
at the academy?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.499
(indistinct chatter)

12:12.532 --> 12:14.467
Yo.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.405
All right.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.807
Come on,

12:19.840 --> 12:20.974
come on.

12:21.008 --> 12:21.975
Here we go.

12:22.009 --> 12:25.478
Oh, man, yo, there is
a purse in here, man.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.379
Like shooting
fish in a barrel.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.116
Yeah, hold, hold on
a beat, Dirty Harry.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.217
First we roll
the scooter by,

12:30.250 --> 12:31.952
give 'em a chance
to turn the bag in.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.121
No way these hippity-hop
mopes turn it in.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.422
They think they won
the lottery.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.059
Hey, yo, Officer.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.393
Yeah, I found this.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.329
Where'd you find this at?
Right there on the bench.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.931
OFFICER:
Just sitting there?

12:43.964 --> 12:44.932
MAN:
Just sitting there.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.134
Damn.
What do you know?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.336
MAN:
Take it in?

12:49.369 --> 12:52.539
MAN 2: Yo, do we get
a reward or no?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.180
SNIPER:
Captain, I have a shot.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.215
CONDO:
Stand by.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.789
(phone line ringing)

13:12.359 --> 13:14.361
(helicopter hovering)

13:18.598 --> 13:21.801
(phones ringing)

13:23.603 --> 13:25.805
Why don't you just tell them
what you want?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.508
Because what I want--

13:28.541 --> 13:30.610
they can't give it to me.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.047
Yeah, well, you keep this up
and we're going to lose him.

13:34.081 --> 13:37.284
(phones ringing)

13:41.288 --> 13:44.257
Hey, friend, you want
to turn the AC back on?

13:44.291 --> 13:47.527
I'm worried about
the injured hostage, Ishmael.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.197
You send him out and we'll
talk about air-conditioning.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.564
Yeah, don't worry about him.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.268
He's definitely not likely.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.536
The round went
through his shoulder--

13:56.569 --> 13:59.206
all meat, no bones, no arteries.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.641
You're not a doctor, Ishmael,
you can't be sure.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.244
Just turn on
the damn air-conditioning.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.316
DANNY:
Are you sure
that's what he said?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.384
Yeah, "not likely,"
like in not likely to die.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.253
You ever hear
anyone say that but a cop?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.988
No, only on this job
do we use a negative

14:15.022 --> 14:16.556
to describe
a positive.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.992
All right, so he's
using police jargon.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.994
The negotiator, too--
he was all over him,

14:21.028 --> 14:22.429
like he knew the script
or something.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.364
Right, like he'd been
on the job.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.999
And then there's
what my CI told me.

14:26.033 --> 14:26.833
What'd he say?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.568
Well, he said
that the dead perp Vario

14:28.601 --> 14:31.071
was hooking up with a guy
new to the business.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.506
You know, I hate
to say this, but...

14:33.540 --> 14:36.977
You can say it--
our perp is a cop.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.184
(garbled radio transmission)

14:44.217 --> 14:46.586
(siren wailing,
helicopter hovering)

14:46.619 --> 14:49.689
Ishmael, I just got some news,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.325
and now I think we're kind of
all on the same side here.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.995
Why's that?
You a bank robber, too?

14:55.028 --> 14:56.096
No,

14:56.129 --> 14:59.299
but you're on the job,
or you were.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.002
Isn't that right?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.537
So we need to
work together

15:04.571 --> 15:07.040
to get you out of
there in one piece.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.475
That's what you want,

15:08.508 --> 15:10.377
and now that's
what we want.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.052
Commissioner, sir.
Commissioner, sir.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.154
As you were.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.155
Good morning.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.224
Not so far, it isn't.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.526
Lieutenant, what do we know?

15:26.559 --> 15:28.095
Sir, we think he may be a cop.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.562
Based on?
He seems to know the
negotiating script

15:29.596 --> 15:31.464
better than any civilian would.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.299
Also he used...
He also referred

15:32.332 --> 15:34.501
to the wounded hostage
as "not likely,"

15:34.534 --> 15:36.036
and who besides a cop
would do that?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.238
Thinking we should let ESU
know it's one of our own.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.407
We'll stick with
standard procedure.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.009
Jack, would you
excuse us a minute?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.043
Sir.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.112
I'm just saying, there's
no need to let a cop...

15:45.145 --> 15:47.114
If a priest messes
with a kid,

15:47.147 --> 15:49.049
is he any less guilty
because of his calling?

15:49.082 --> 15:50.117
No, sir.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.152
Do you respect his bishop
if he uses his position

15:52.185 --> 15:53.686
to protect the priest?

15:53.720 --> 15:57.190
I'm just...
Danny, whether he
is or was a cop is irrelevant.

15:57.224 --> 16:00.060
Right now he's a bank robber
with hostages,

16:00.093 --> 16:03.296
and Jack Condo is
my best hostage negotiator.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.998
This is his show,
understood?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.233
Yes, sir.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.035
Excuse me.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.603
They blew up this shot from the
security camera-- the tattoo.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
Bella horrida?

16:15.175 --> 16:16.609
What's bella horrida?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.778
It's a Latin phrase from Virgil.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.082
Bella horrida-- horrid wars.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.251
What is it?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.619
What?

16:28.288 --> 16:29.656
Everything okay?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.224
(sighs)
Yeah, don't ask.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.293
Eighth Squad found the van.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.096
All right, let's go.
Okay.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.097
(elevator bell dings)

16:37.130 --> 16:39.799
Baker, I want the rosters
and current status

16:39.832 --> 16:42.469
of every member of the
Special Investigative Unit

16:42.502 --> 16:45.105
from 1995 through '99.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.306
Including the C.O.?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.341
I was the C.O.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.413
DANNY:
Okay, so now we got the van.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.348
We just got to find
the missing perp.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.084
Hey, what do you got for us?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.518
Beautiful day
for a crime scene, detectives.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.188
Sunshine means
people use sun visors.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.589
That's always one
place they never check

17:02.622 --> 17:04.091
to wipe for prints.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.059
We pulled a gorgeous
thumbprint right there.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.427
Beautiful.
We're in a bit of a hurry.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.428
Can you expedite
that for us?

17:08.461 --> 17:09.562
Well, if you get

17:09.596 --> 17:11.598
your partner bonita here
to give me one of those

17:11.631 --> 17:14.067
big smiles,
you got a deal.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.168
Que sonrisa.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.204
Hey, Casanova, come on,
you got anything else for us?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.405
Oh, yeah,
check it out.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.541
We got this from the parking lot
at Kings General Hospital.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.809
Dated yesterday.

17:22.842 --> 17:23.710
Yesterday?
The van was stolen

17:23.743 --> 17:26.513
two days ago
at a lot at Williamsburg.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.747
What, this perp
took the van

17:27.780 --> 17:29.082
to the hospital?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.718
Look, if you get the lab

17:31.751 --> 17:33.520
to turn that print around
in an hour,

17:33.553 --> 17:35.588
I got two Mets tickets
behind the dugout for you.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.590
Your partner--
she come with me?

17:37.624 --> 17:38.391
Huh?

17:38.425 --> 17:40.227
You should know better
than that.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.228
Should know better what?
Never date

17:41.261 --> 17:43.396
a girl with a gun.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.570
(siren wailing)

17:50.603 --> 17:52.605
(garbled radio transmission)

17:56.209 --> 17:59.379
(sighs)

17:59.412 --> 18:03.683
So... you don't have
a plan "B," do you?

18:03.716 --> 18:04.784
Don't antagonize him.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.619
I'm supposed to just
sit here and die?

18:12.192 --> 18:15.462
No, it's Vario--
V-A-R-I-O-- Vario.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.397
No staff by that name.
Okay,

18:17.430 --> 18:19.299
what about patients?
Detective,

18:19.332 --> 18:20.800
you know better than that.
Marie,

18:20.833 --> 18:22.235
there are lives at
stake here, okay?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.237
So is my career,
Danny.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.673
(phone rings)

18:26.706 --> 18:28.708
Reagan.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.577
You're kidding me.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.513
All right, yeah,
yeah, great, yeah.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.283
They found a match on the
thumbprint in the van.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.284
It's a Kevin Moran.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.117
The Mets tickets worked.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.586
Can you check Kevin
Moran, please?

18:41.254 --> 18:44.191
Marie.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.194
Marie, please.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.262
Wow, do you hear
my stomach growling?

18:49.296 --> 18:50.897
I need to go
grab my yogurt.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.766
Helps keep me regular.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.304
Okay.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.742
Anything?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.444
No Moran.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.314
Nothing.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.782
We're missing
something here, Jack.

19:09.816 --> 19:14.287
Okay, Kevin Moran was released
from Wallkill three months ago

19:14.321 --> 19:15.788
after a dime for armed robbery.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.191
His last known address
was in the 3-5.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.526
Already checked him out,
though, he's negative.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.662
Well, he also had
a girlfriend-- a Lacy Campisi.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.663
She's probably worth
checking out.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.965
Is there any connection
between Moran and Vario?

19:25.998 --> 19:26.966
Um, well,

19:26.999 --> 19:27.767
Vario was from Manhattan,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.702
Moran was from
the ass end of Queens.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.438
Vario did banks.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.439
Yeah, Moran

19:32.472 --> 19:33.940
did warehouses.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.543
(phone rings)

19:36.576 --> 19:38.245
Yeah, Dad.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.379
Do you have any intersection

19:39.412 --> 19:41.214
on the accomplices?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.482
So far, nothing.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.517
Well, take another look
at the robbery charges

19:44.551 --> 19:45.718
on their rap sheet.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.554
Who were the arresting officers?

19:47.587 --> 19:50.290
Let's see, nothing, and

19:50.323 --> 19:53.526
a Flood and...

19:55.027 --> 19:58.298
Flood, William J.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.333
Billy Flood.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.234
(sighs)

20:01.268 --> 20:02.235
You think?

20:02.269 --> 20:03.870
I hate to say it, but yeah.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.639
I talked to his ex-wife,
I may even have a motive.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.875
I'll leave it to you
to hand it over to Condo.

20:08.908 --> 20:09.876
All right.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.578
We'll stay in touch.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.380
Who's Billy Flood?

20:13.413 --> 20:16.649
When you were a reporter,
you did that story on my unit.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.386
Special Investigations.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.720
Yeah.
No one would
actually confirm

20:20.753 --> 20:22.355
that it existed.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.390
It did exist.

20:28.027 --> 20:31.298
And Billy Flood was one
of the best men in the unit.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.265
Our guy in
the bank

20:32.299 --> 20:33.900
is a Frank Reagan guy?

20:33.933 --> 20:37.404
Not is-- was.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.585
All right, Lacy, this guy
Moran, he smacks you around

20:52.619 --> 20:55.555
and yet you're still sitting
here protecting him?

20:55.588 --> 20:56.856
I haven't seen
him for months.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.592
Right, okay, well, your
neighbors said there
was a lot of arguing

20:59.626 --> 21:01.461
coming from your
apartment this morning.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.062
Who was yelling?
I was.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.031
My kid was making
a mess again.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.066
You got a kid?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.802
Hmm, so you probably
won't mind then.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.304
Mind what?

21:11.338 --> 21:12.805
If I call my buddy Paulie.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.642
Who's Paulie?
Just Paulie.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.676
Terminator Paulie?

21:16.709 --> 21:18.345
Terminator Paulie.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.746
You know what
Terminator Paulie does?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.948
He works for
the city.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.850
Spends all day terminating
people's parental rights.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.652
What's that got to do with me?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.587
Well, you're gonna be going
upstate for hindering

21:27.620 --> 21:30.557
prosecution, so Paulie's gonna
get to do what Paulie does best.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.559
That's right.
By the time you see

21:32.592 --> 21:34.661
your kid again, he'll be growing
up with his new mommy.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.496
Probably won't even
recognize you.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.465
You can't do that.
You're right,
we can't do it.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.966
But Paulie can.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.735
Hey, Paulie...
I told you-- I don't
know where Moran is!

21:42.769 --> 21:44.537
Danny Reagan here.
I need a favor.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.673
Yeah. Look, I got
a case for you.
Wait!

21:46.706 --> 21:48.541
Oh, yeah.
Wait, wait.

21:48.575 --> 21:51.544
No, she's sitting
right here.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.880
You got to promise me
he won't get out this time.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.715
Look, Moran is not getting out
of prison

21:55.748 --> 21:56.949
unless he leaves in a pine box.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.619
The guy's a psycho.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.788
If he's a psycho,
then help us find him,

22:01.821 --> 22:04.023
and I promise you,
you will never see him again.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.961
Okay. Hey, Paulie.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.764
I'm gonna send her
up your way. Yeah.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.566
He came by this morning.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.635
Took all the cash I had.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.104
It was my rent money,
the bastard.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.941
I'll get back to you.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.376
All right, well, do you know

22:23.410 --> 22:25.111
where he would go
if he was on the run?

22:25.144 --> 22:30.483
Kept an old convertible
at a chop shop in Brooklyn.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.151
Friend of his runs the place.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.453
You know the address?

22:33.486 --> 22:35.054
It's on Kent Street,

22:35.087 --> 22:36.589
by Broadway, I think.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.859
It's right around
where the van was stolen.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.132
REPORTER: We've just arrived
on the scene at the bank

22:46.165 --> 22:49.969
where the hostage situation
is unfolding.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.605
Billy Flood was
one of the best.

22:52.639 --> 22:55.174
Your father handpicked
him for his unit.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.444
They were all
young, all single,

22:57.477 --> 22:59.679
all expert marksmen.

22:59.712 --> 23:03.049
ERIN:
Sounds more like the Foreign
Legion than a police unit.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.417
Well, it was
crack cocaine days.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.185
We were fighting a war.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.787
Their job was

23:07.820 --> 23:09.789
to go after the
worst of the worst.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.591
They had no set tours,

23:11.624 --> 23:13.560
could use any weapon
they wanted.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.062
Basically, it was shoot first
and ask questions later.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.597
And these were the good guys?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.799
The stress got to Flood.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.701
Started drinking.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.802
Hmm.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.738
We sent him to
The Farm twice.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.074
Then one day
in broad daylight on-duty,

23:28.107 --> 23:30.743
he wraps his car around a pole
on Fifth Avenue.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.745
He was drunk?
Yeah.

23:32.779 --> 23:37.484
Yeah, drinking on the job
was a huge problem back then.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.852
I had to set an example,

23:39.886 --> 23:41.954
so I terminated him.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.091
I didn't think I had a choice.

23:45.124 --> 23:49.962
But now...

23:49.996 --> 23:52.765
I'm wondering
if I'd handled it differently,

23:52.799 --> 23:57.103
maybe it's the Nature Channel
we're watching instead.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.174
LINDA:
Sorry I'm late.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.144
What happened?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.013
Somebody die?

24:09.582 --> 24:12.051
Kevin Moran?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.053
Police!

24:14.086 --> 24:17.957
This guy Moran could have been
on the road for hours by now.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.528
There's a light on in back.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.829
I'm gonna check it out.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.832
There's a convertible over here.

24:25.865 --> 24:29.569
Thing probably hasn't been
on the road since the
Clinton administration.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.107
Kevin Moran.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.549
Reagan!
Hold it!

24:42.582 --> 24:44.551
Let her go.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.819
I'm not going back to the joint.
So you decide.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.921
Decide what?
Whether or not you want to go

24:48.955 --> 24:50.857
to your partner's funeral
three days from now.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.593
Hey, the guy you shot
in the bank is fine.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.962
There's no bodies on you,
so let her go.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.965
Reagan, just shoot
the son of a bitch. Go ahead.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.868
I'm counting to three. One...

25:01.901 --> 25:03.202
two...

25:03.235 --> 25:05.938
All right!

25:05.972 --> 25:08.207
All right.

25:13.746 --> 25:14.947
All right.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.585
I give up.
Too late.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.021
Moron.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.056
Nice shot.
It was very therapeutic.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.192
Though he didn't put up
much of a fight.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.894
You should have let me hit him.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.328
(handcuffs clicking)

25:29.361 --> 25:30.963
JAMIE:
You might not like it,

25:30.997 --> 25:32.765
but most people do
the right thing.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.687
(motorcycle approaching)

25:57.757 --> 25:59.058
He's mine.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.930
Hey, cowboy. Police.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.231
Don't move.

26:05.264 --> 26:08.100
You're a cop, little lady?
No problem.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.814
(yelling)

26:21.848 --> 26:24.717
Get down.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.619
I got a gun.

26:28.955 --> 26:32.058
All right, people,
come on, back it up.
Got him?

26:32.091 --> 26:33.960
Petit larceny and a gun.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.997
Some people, partner,
definitely do the wrong thing.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.298
Stop moving.

26:39.331 --> 26:42.902
Hey, anything?
Zippo.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.204
Trying to get him to let
the wounded hostage go.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.407
But, you know,
I knew this guy.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.243
Yeah, I hear
he was the real police.
Yeah, he was.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.679
When the bad guys tell
ghost stories,

26:52.712 --> 26:53.746
it's SIU they're talking about.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.081
Why don't you let
me talk to him?

26:55.114 --> 26:56.783
Come on, Danny,
you know we discourage

26:56.816 --> 26:58.350
third party intervention...
I know the protocol.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.787
Okay, please.
I know, but I can
get through to this guy.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.055
Let me take care of this.
Let me do my job. Thank you.
All right.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.696
That's his daughter, right?
Yeah, Emma's her name.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.964
Emma, right.
Yeah, we got it off
his ex-wife.

27:11.998 --> 27:15.034
Your father tipped us. You
should probably talk to him.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.669
Yeah, I'll do that.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.273
Why don't you
just give up?

27:21.307 --> 27:23.976
There's
no way out.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.978
Do you really want to die?

27:29.048 --> 27:31.417
We're not going
to stop you.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.254
(phone ringing)

27:39.158 --> 27:44.130
So, why'd you quit
nursing school?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.432
Because I can't stand
the sight of blood.

27:46.465 --> 27:47.834
(chuckles)

27:47.867 --> 27:49.836
(coughs)
Oh, my God, he's
going into shock!

27:49.869 --> 27:51.871
We need to get him
out of here now!

27:51.904 --> 27:54.774
(phone ringing)

28:00.479 --> 28:01.447
(phone buzzing)

28:01.480 --> 28:03.449
Yeah.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.719
I'm ready to talk
about the injured hostage.
That's a smart move, Billy.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.721
We're going to send
two paramedics in.

28:08.755 --> 28:12.024
And you send in two cops
dressed as EMT's? No!

28:17.997 --> 28:19.031
Billy, Billy,

28:19.065 --> 28:20.366
listen, it's Danny Reagan.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.434
Listen, it's me, all right?

28:22.468 --> 28:25.037
Let me come in. No paramedics,
nobody, just me.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.039
All right, let me get
the guy out of there.

28:27.073 --> 28:30.076
Come on, it'll make things
easier for you, all right?

28:34.947 --> 28:36.916
(hostage coughs)

28:43.089 --> 28:45.758
ERIN:
I remember Billy Flood

28:45.792 --> 28:47.393
from all the barbecues
Dad used to have.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.928
He was handsome.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.330
All the girls used
to swoon over him.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.800
Gee, girls falling
for a handsome cop--

28:53.833 --> 28:55.067
how could that happen?

28:55.101 --> 28:57.336
I don't think
you have to worry

28:57.369 --> 28:59.538
that Danny's going
to start robbing banks.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.342
It's a fine line--
cops and robbers.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.011
Most people choose

29:05.044 --> 29:06.478
what side they're on
early in life.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.147
Yeah, what I mean is

29:08.180 --> 29:12.218
even the good guys
have to do awful things.

29:14.386 --> 29:18.424
I just... I worry about Danny,

29:18.457 --> 29:22.028
Jamie, Frank, all of you.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.931
You spend so much time with
the ugliness of life.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.432
All the violence.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.200
It's got to scar you.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.436
I think coming from a family
like this makes it easier.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.171
I mean, we can talk about it.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.572
We all get it.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.508
I just see what it does
to Danny, and...

29:36.542 --> 29:40.112
There are days I wish he would
have stayed in construction.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.249
Don't tell him I said that.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.018
I'm serious.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.287
(garbled radio transmissions)
DANNY:
Let me come in, all right?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.890
Come on, Billy.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.125
Come on, give me a shot.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.497
Fine. Hurry up.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.999
Right. All right.
Hey, hey, you can't do this.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.301
Come on, he said for me to...
We're gonna lose control
of the situation.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.371
We're not gonna lose control...
We're supposed
to follow procedure.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.306
He said no EMT's!
Your father said
follow procedure!

30:07.339 --> 30:10.943
If I don't go in there,
the guy is gonna die!
Let him go.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.411
CONDO: All right,
Captain.

30:33.532 --> 30:37.003
Linda, Erin, get in here.

30:38.004 --> 30:41.040
They're sending
Danny in.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.509
Why are they sending Danny?
I don't know.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.112
REPORTER: ...where the hostage
situation has been unfolding.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.915
He'd bring his gun
in with him, though, right?

30:51.017 --> 30:53.385
I can't say for sure
what's going on.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.489
Except that this was
probably his idea.

31:07.934 --> 31:11.503
REPORTER: No one's quite sure
what's going on...

31:11.537 --> 31:13.605
This could be a major
turning point

31:13.639 --> 31:16.242
in this highly tense
hostage situation.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.144
Did you know
about this?

31:18.177 --> 31:21.147
We'll keep you informed as more
details become available.
No.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.190
It's all right.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.059
(gasping)

31:33.092 --> 31:34.160
Hey.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.229
Right?

31:37.263 --> 31:41.133
Okay, no tricks.
It's just me.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.907
I'm going to approach
the victim, all right?

31:49.708 --> 31:52.144
Go.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.991
Hey!

32:05.024 --> 32:06.492
It's all right.
Hey, Billy,

32:06.525 --> 32:08.527
it's all right.
I'm just taking him out.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.696
It's like we agreed, all right?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.200
(hostage coughing)

32:14.233 --> 32:15.434
It's okay.

32:18.137 --> 32:21.307
No problem.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.479
Come on, I got a hostage.
Come on!

32:36.122 --> 32:39.191
Fantastic.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.194
Now we got the P.C.'s
son held hostage.

32:42.228 --> 32:47.333
Yeah, I'd say that was a pretty
crappy career move, Captain.

32:47.366 --> 32:51.270
We line up this shot, I'm taking
this bastard Flood out.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.371
Okay.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.406
Billy...

32:54.440 --> 32:56.375
You got what you wanted,
Danny, just go.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.544
I didn't come here
for him, Billy.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.412
I came for you.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.682
Your father knows I'm in here?

33:03.715 --> 33:06.685
Billy, the whole city knows
you're in here by now.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.255
CAPTAIN (over radio):
You got a green light.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.423
Roger, Captain.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.226
(helicopter hovering)

33:14.260 --> 33:16.295
It's too late for you
to save me, Danny,

33:16.328 --> 33:17.263
so just go.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.330
No, it isn't.
Listen...

33:18.364 --> 33:21.600
You got me.
Why don't we let her go?

33:21.633 --> 33:22.868
We don't need her, Billy.

33:22.901 --> 33:25.571
Let's let her go. We'll figure
this out together, you and me.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.306
The only think I need
to figure out, Danny,

33:27.339 --> 33:30.176
is do I have
the balls to shoot myself

33:30.209 --> 33:32.344
or do I take
the coward's way out

33:32.378 --> 33:34.713
and let that sniper do it
for me?

33:34.746 --> 33:36.715
Billy... Billy!

33:36.748 --> 33:38.484
Hey! Don't do it.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.286
Oh... Billy!

33:43.322 --> 33:45.191
Come on. Don't do it.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.692
Billy, look at me.
Billy!

33:46.725 --> 33:48.327
All right,
I tell you what.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.496
You want to do it?
You want to kill yourself?

33:50.529 --> 33:54.066
Okay, do it.
What about her, Billy?

33:54.100 --> 33:57.203
Huh?

33:57.236 --> 33:58.337
What about your little girl?

33:58.370 --> 33:59.705
You do that,

33:59.738 --> 34:02.808
who's gonna take care
of your little girl, Billy?

34:02.841 --> 34:05.744
That's right, look at her.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.347
Who's gonna take
care of her then?

34:10.416 --> 34:12.251
I know that's why you're here.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.820
Come on. The whole city knows
that's why you're here, okay?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.523
My old man
even said it.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.525
He said, "If I was in Billy
Flood's position,

34:19.558 --> 34:21.193
"and my kid was gonna die

34:21.227 --> 34:23.095
"if she didn't get
an operation and didn't

34:23.129 --> 34:26.398
have any money or insurance,
I would do the same thing."

34:28.167 --> 34:31.670
SNIPER (over radio):
Reagan's blocking my shot.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.739
Come on. Your little girl
does not want you stepping

34:33.772 --> 34:35.407
in front of that window
and neither do I.

34:35.441 --> 34:38.377
You know what is outside
that window, Billy.

34:41.313 --> 34:44.316
She needs a heart transplant.
She's eight years old.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.584
I can't help her.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.586
You know what
that's like, Danny,

34:47.619 --> 34:50.489
not being able to save
your own child?

34:50.522 --> 34:51.857
I don't.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.325
I was gonna fly her
out tonight,

34:53.359 --> 34:56.295
get the operation in India.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.764
"Medical tourism," they call it.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.433
100 grand is all I needed.

35:01.467 --> 35:04.336
It's crazy,
I know, but...

35:07.673 --> 35:10.642
(voice breaking): She's the only
good thing I ever did.

35:10.676 --> 35:14.380
The only good thing
I ever did.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.682
No, she's not, Billy.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.518
You were a good cop.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.320
You are a good cop.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.889
Do the right thing here.

35:23.922 --> 35:27.159
It's not too late
to fix it, Billy.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.230
(sirens wailing)

35:31.263 --> 35:34.266
Nah...

35:34.300 --> 35:35.367
I'm nothing.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.745
(grunts)

35:53.652 --> 35:55.421
(shouting)

35:55.454 --> 35:57.423
Go to the right!
Go, go, go, go!

35:57.456 --> 35:58.890
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:58.924 --> 36:01.460
Move it! Go!
Clear!

36:01.493 --> 36:03.862
It's over, Billy.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.631
I'm sorry.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.665
I'm sorry.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.803
(panting)
(handcuffs clicking)

36:13.739 --> 36:15.474
(sighs)

36:20.312 --> 36:22.681
"Sources close
to the mayor said,

36:22.714 --> 36:25.784
'If the Police Commissioner
thinks sending his son

36:25.817 --> 36:29.455
'to conduct cowboy diplomacy
is the way

36:29.488 --> 36:31.690
'to handle these situations,

36:31.723 --> 36:35.361
he is sorely out of touch.'"
Huh...

36:35.394 --> 36:38.464
Well, I couldn't agree more.
JAMIE:
I got back to the house

36:38.497 --> 36:41.400
with the collar, guys all had
it on the break room TV.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.769
They're all ripping
into me about Danny
going into that bank.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.937
Well, for what it's worth,
it was my bad idea

36:45.971 --> 36:47.339
to go into the bank.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.774
Dad had nothing
to do with it.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.008
What a surprise.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.710
HENRY: All good cops
pull a ruse,

36:51.743 --> 36:54.613
but the great cops,
they know when to improvise.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.015
So you just let 'em run amok?

36:57.048 --> 37:01.253
I was informed by the Incident
Commander that he was sent in.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.621
Chain of command noted
and observed.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.556
Still, when I saw you
walk into that bank

37:04.590 --> 37:07.459
like John Wayne,
I wanted to choke you.

37:07.493 --> 37:08.460
Who's John Wayne?

37:08.494 --> 37:10.429
That's sad.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.563
(Henry chuckles)

37:11.597 --> 37:12.931
He's an old movie star.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.600
NICKY: How about Billy
Flood's daughter?

37:14.633 --> 37:15.867
What's gonna happen to her?

37:15.901 --> 37:17.503
Well, I think
she's gonna be okay.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.472
Catholic Charities moved her up
to the top of their list.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.341
Funny thing, after
church today,

37:22.374 --> 37:23.775
Father McMurray mentioned
how grateful he was

37:23.809 --> 37:25.577
for a donation to
the hospital's fund.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.646
Well, I guess there's

37:27.679 --> 37:29.781
a lot of generous people
in this city.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.417
LINDA:
So it was all for nothing.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.286
He could have
just asked for help.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.387
Instead, he robbed a bank.

37:35.421 --> 37:38.990
Sometimes we judge ourselves
by our good intentions,

37:39.024 --> 37:42.728
but we are judged
by our last worst act.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.829
Are you listening, boys?

37:43.862 --> 37:44.530
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

37:44.563 --> 37:47.299
I'm so glad I married a hero.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.504
(clears throat)

37:55.774 --> 37:57.909
Excuse me.

38:06.852 --> 38:10.922
Hey, what's
going on?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.325
What's the problem,
Linda?

38:13.359 --> 38:16.094
I'm so glad that Billy Flood's
daughter's gonna be okay,

38:16.127 --> 38:17.596
but what about
our kids, Danny?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.365
What about our kids, Linda?
Our kids are fine.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.499
What are you talking about?
Really? Really?

38:20.532 --> 38:22.501
How are our kids gonna be?
What are you
talking about?

38:22.534 --> 38:24.836
What's gonna happen to our kids
the next time you swagger into

38:24.870 --> 38:26.838
one of those buildings,
and then you don't come out?

38:26.872 --> 38:29.074
What about our kids
then, huh, Danny?

38:29.107 --> 38:31.877
What about me?
Son of a bitch.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.512
Linda, I knew the guy,

38:33.545 --> 38:35.481
I knew what he was
doing in the bank,

38:35.514 --> 38:37.483
and I knew he wasn't
gonna shoot me.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.551
You don't know that.
You don't know any such thing!

38:39.585 --> 38:40.852
That is macho crap!

38:40.886 --> 38:42.588
John Wayne.

38:42.621 --> 38:46.725
John Wayne never faced a real
gun in his life. John Wayne...

38:50.662 --> 38:52.764
(sobs softly)

38:52.798 --> 38:56.635
I was watching it on TV, Danny.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.871
I saw you.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.680
It scared the crap out of me.

39:08.714 --> 39:12.484
Hey. Hey...

39:12.518 --> 39:14.586
(heavy breaths)

39:19.190 --> 39:21.393
Come on.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.661
(sobs)

39:22.694 --> 39:24.496
I'm sorry.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.798
I'm so sorry.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.800
Look, I love you.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.636
I love you and
those boys

39:30.669 --> 39:32.003
more than anything
on this Earth,

39:32.037 --> 39:33.138
and I promise you

39:33.171 --> 39:35.674
I won't let
anything happen.

39:37.676 --> 39:41.447
You know, the first and last
thing I think about every day

39:41.480 --> 39:46.652
before I do anything is
to get home safe to you.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.559
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.161
What would you do if
I needed an operation
and we had no money?

39:56.194 --> 39:58.196
And your life was
on the line?

39:58.229 --> 39:59.465
Yeah.

39:59.498 --> 40:00.699
Rob a bank.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.733
(scoffs)

40:01.767 --> 40:03.535
Wow, Ma Barker.
(all chuckle)

40:03.569 --> 40:06.171
Don't listen to your aunt, boys.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.642
HENRY: When you were
18 months old,

40:10.676 --> 40:13.545
you spiked a fever, 105 degrees.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.046
It's 3:00
in the morning.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.682
You mother's in a panic.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.017
There'd been an outbreak
of meningitis

40:19.050 --> 40:20.719
in the neighborhood.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.053
Three dead toddlers.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.857
An ambulance crew arrives,

40:25.891 --> 40:28.026
they want to take you
to St. Victor's;

40:28.059 --> 40:29.094
a butcher shop.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.464
I insist on Methodist.
The guy says,

40:32.498 --> 40:34.600
"I'm not authorized
to go there."

40:34.633 --> 40:37.135
Now, you're burning up,
convulsing in my arms.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.639
I take out my service
revolver and I say,

40:40.672 --> 40:43.675
"Now you're authorized."

40:43.709 --> 40:45.711
(chuckling)

40:47.679 --> 40:50.048
Check out Pops
getting all gangsta.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.717
He pulled a gun
on an EMT.

40:51.750 --> 40:52.584
I never heard that story.

40:52.618 --> 40:56.221
We almost lost you that night,
Francis.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.690
Guess I owe you one, Pop.
