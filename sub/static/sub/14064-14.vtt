00:00.882 --> 00:01.777
Take all the money out of the

00:01.777 --> 00:03.254
drawer and put it in a bag.

00:03.254 --> 00:04.665
She already murdered a man.

00:04.665 --> 00:06.007
Please let this one get away.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.196
All the rules in this relationship.

00:08.231 --> 00:09.785
I'm sorry.

00:09.820 --> 00:12.311
But if you hit me or anything,

00:12.346 --> 00:13.551
I might literally die.

00:13.551 --> 00:15.562
Your case is dismissed.
You're free and clear.

00:15.562 --> 00:16.768
I've found you a job.

00:16.768 --> 00:17.881
Come and get it.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.317
So I've met this girl.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.385
You did?

00:20.420 --> 00:21.383
Irma Levine.

00:21.418 --> 00:22.728
You don't fool me.

00:22.763 --> 00:24.663
She gives me a bit of trouble.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:58.094 --> 00:58.454
Hello.

00:59.220 --> 01:02.171
Ms Levine. Alan Shore.

01:02.954 --> 01:05.530
Hello, Mr Shore.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.109
Uh, is there something I can do for you?

01:08.193 --> 01:09.319
<i>There is.</i>

01:09.402 --> 01:11.742
And let me preface my remarks by saying

01:11.770 --> 01:14.552
while we don't know each other very well and

01:14.587 --> 01:17.334
while I'd rather be speaking to you in person

01:17.369 --> 01:19.919
<i>so as to beter gauge your reaction,</i>

01:19.954 --> 01:24.971
<i>Ms Levine,</i> I've been having certain
fantasies about you.

01:26.502 --> 01:31.937
Intense, unabashedly sexual fantasies

01:33.259 --> 01:37.388
and I thought we could meet to discuss them.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.225
<i>Did you get that?</i>

01:42.755 --> 01:44.228
One drink.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.735
Ms Levine!

01:52.770 --> 01:54.069
Mr Shore.

01:55.072 --> 01:58.075
I took the liberty of ordering champagne.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.119
Thank you.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.509
So? These fantasies?

02:09.544 --> 02:12.443
They're many and varied actualy.

02:12.848 --> 02:14.910
But now that you're here they seem

02:14.945 --> 02:17.045
a very poor substitute for reality.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.152
Well, I'll admit I've been having

02:20.181 --> 02:22.099
some fantasies of my own.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.897
Have you? Tell.

02:25.811 --> 02:27.834
I walk into a building.

02:27.869 --> 02:29.905
My old high school gym

02:29.940 --> 02:31.942
you follow me inside

02:32.026 --> 02:34.153
and there are these booths

02:34.188 --> 02:36.280
set up. It's election day.

02:36.363 --> 02:37.698
Why not?

02:37.781 --> 02:41.243
I go into a very small booth and
you follow me in.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.400
Your hand, like the breeze,

02:44.435 --> 02:47.016
reaches up my inner thighs

02:47.051 --> 02:49.602
and I turn around and I say,

02:49.637 --> 02:52.154
“It's not right”. And you say…

02:52.189 --> 02:53.830
Shut up and let's do this.

02:54.528 --> 02:57.122
And you say, “What's not right?”

02:57.157 --> 03:02.245
And I say, “It's not right that I should
vote and my

03:02.280 --> 03:05.639
vote doesn't count due to redistricting”.

03:05.839 --> 03:06.876
What?

03:06.911 --> 03:09.190
All of our elected officials are

03:09.225 --> 03:11.599
redrawing the district voting lines

03:11.634 --> 03:13.974
to tilt the elections in their favor.

03:14.009 --> 03:15.561
Our officials are stealing our

03:15.561 --> 03:17.604
country, Alan. And we need to stop them.

03:17.604 --> 03:19.245
And I may need a lawyer.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.847
And I'm guessing you're not
looking for a naked one.

03:21.847 --> 03:24.379
This could be the worst threat to
democracy ever, Alan.

03:24.379 --> 03:26.987
And no one is paying attention.

03:27.022 --> 03:30.494
We're gonna make them pay attention.

03:31.626 --> 03:35.422
Take our votes now!

03:42.095 --> 03:44.938
Oddly, this was one of my fantasies.

03:44.973 --> 03:47.969
And the chilly weather is certainly an
added bonus.

03:47.969 --> 03:49.529
<i>Pack it up, ladies.</i>

03:49.554 --> 03:50.895
<i>Pack it up.</i>

03:52.689 --> 03:55.733
All right. Ladies! That's it. Let's go.

03:55.768 --> 03:58.778
Okay. Everybody stay calm. Alan? Alan?

03:58.813 --> 04:00.071
Yes! No problem.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.365
Ah. Ah.

04:03.491 --> 04:05.994
I forgot what I was going to say.

04:06.029 --> 04:06.995
Oh yes! Ah.

04:07.078 --> 04:10.373
And I say this with great reluctance. Here.

04:10.457 --> 04:11.833
Don't answer any questions.

04:11.833 --> 04:14.752
I'll be down to bail you out as soon as I can.

04:50.788 --> 04:52.435
And I'm not sucking up.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.167
Saving that boy the way you did?

04:54.167 --> 04:55.675
You're a real local hero.

04:55.710 --> 05:00.590
And the media darling.
The cameras loved you.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.139
–Thanks.
–Hm.

05:02.174 --> 05:04.295
Alan Shore said some
very good things about you.

05:04.295 --> 05:07.722
Well! He's an excellent attorney.

05:07.757 --> 05:08.896
So tell me.

05:08.931 --> 05:11.302
Why do you want to work
at Crane, Poole and Schmidt?

05:11.302 --> 05:12.441
The money.

05:12.476 --> 05:14.937
I've served for six years
at the D.A.'s office.

05:14.937 --> 05:16.497
Working eighty hour weeks,

05:16.564 --> 05:18.065
eating dinner out of to-go tins.

05:18.065 --> 05:19.984
My furniture is from my parent's garage.

05:19.984 --> 05:22.646
And buy my clothes
from “Janey's Dress for Less”.

05:22.646 --> 05:24.280
I could tell you some crap about wanting

05:24.280 --> 05:26.104
new and exciting challenges and blah, blah, blah.

05:26.104 --> 05:29.610
But, why not just be honest? It's the money.

05:35.165 --> 05:38.078
What kind of business
could you bring to the firm?

05:38.078 --> 05:39.503
Oh, I made a lot of contacts

05:39.503 --> 05:41.046
when I was doing white-collar crime.

05:41.046 --> 05:44.581
I also know a lot of cops and
detectives, and inspectors.

05:44.758 --> 05:47.804
And of course I am wired
into the D.A.'s office.

05:47.839 --> 05:50.222
Uh huh!

05:56.770 --> 05:58.981
That's a website for a ski resort?

05:59.016 --> 06:01.400
Yeah. Whistler. Do you ski?

06:01.435 --> 06:02.776
No.

06:02.818 --> 06:05.054
And it's really a shame cuz here I am

06:05.089 --> 06:07.369
freezing my butt off of Mount Bendejo.

06:14.913 --> 06:17.583
Adios, muchacha.

06:20.544 --> 06:22.351
Mr Hopper has finally come around.

06:22.351 --> 06:24.172
It took us a long time to get him here,

06:24.172 --> 06:25.751
but he's willing to settle.

06:25.751 --> 06:28.854
I'm thinking of getting them
to rename lung cancer after me.

06:28.854 --> 06:30.178
Daniel? Are you listening to me?

06:30.178 --> 06:32.257
Think about it. You know, it makes sense.

06:32.257 --> 06:34.200
The Lou Gehrig thing?

06:34.235 --> 06:36.143
We're going in now.

06:36.435 --> 06:40.147
Good morning, Samantha.
Mr Hopper in the rest room?

06:40.182 --> 06:43.775
No. His wife just called.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.778
He died this morning.

06:59.082 --> 07:00.994
I can't believe you did this to me.

07:00.994 --> 07:02.168
What did I do?

07:02.203 --> 07:03.962
This.

07:04.629 --> 07:06.464
<i>It's complete chaos out here.</i>

07:06.464 --> 07:08.209
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

07:08.209 --> 07:11.136
Ha, ha, it was quite a scene.

07:11.678 --> 07:12.991
Oh, look! It's me!

07:13.026 --> 07:14.305
I can see that.

07:14.340 --> 07:15.765
You were there in a sea of

07:15.765 --> 07:17.135
breasts and you didn't invite me.

07:17.135 --> 07:18.726
It wasn't a sex thing, Denny.

07:18.726 --> 07:22.564
This was a political protest
about a serious issue.

07:22.599 --> 07:24.190
I heard there were two hundred

07:24.190 --> 07:25.775
women. That's four hundred breasts.

07:25.775 --> 07:28.111
And you kept them all to yourself.

07:28.194 --> 07:29.730
I have to get to an arraignment.

07:29.730 --> 07:30.521
The topless woman?

07:30.521 --> 07:31.093
Yes.

07:31.128 --> 07:31.769
I'll go with you.

07:31.769 --> 07:34.492
It's in court. She'll be completely dressed.

07:34.575 --> 07:36.217
Aww. Why are they pixelating them?

07:36.217 --> 07:38.494
This is a cable news channel.

07:38.529 --> 07:40.772
You can show breasts on cable.

07:53.052 --> 07:55.429
Yes, may I help you, dear?

07:55.596 --> 07:57.160
This is my office.

07:57.195 --> 07:58.519
Oh. I needed a base of

07:58.554 --> 08:00.625
operation for my sandwich cart business.

08:00.625 --> 08:01.259
But, I…

08:01.294 --> 08:03.024
You're a first-year? Right?

08:03.059 --> 08:04.719
Well, it goes like this.

08:04.754 --> 08:06.793
Named partner, senior partner,

08:06.828 --> 08:08.808
junior partner, senior associate,

08:08.833 --> 08:12.530
sandwich lades, Xerox guy, janitor, first-years.

08:12.613 --> 08:12.824
But I…

08:12.824 --> 08:14.274
I'm on the phone, dear.

08:14.615 --> 08:16.325
Oh.

08:16.701 --> 08:18.995
Did she know that when she asked him?

08:19.030 --> 08:21.580
Oh, no! Ha, ha.

08:23.708 --> 08:24.959
The lawsuit's been dropped.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.351
The claims died with Hopper and the

08:26.351 --> 08:28.796
wife decided not to pursue it any further.

08:28.796 --> 08:32.049
I wanna see she gets
the original settlement offer.

08:32.258 --> 08:34.552
You don't have to do that, Daniel.

08:34.717 --> 08:36.136
Sure I do.

08:37.763 --> 08:39.503
Hey! You busy tomorrow night?

08:39.946 --> 08:41.058
No. Why? What's going on?

08:41.058 --> 08:42.885
I thought you might wanna go to a funeral.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.085
Hopper's?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.284
No. Mine.

08:46.105 --> 08:47.899
We'll go in my limo. I got a TV,

08:47.899 --> 08:49.525
I got the uppy downy things so we can

08:49.525 --> 08:51.151
make out and the driver can't see us.

08:51.151 --> 08:54.023
Yeah.  Uh.  I love making out
on the way to funerals,

08:54.023 --> 08:56.747
especially with the guest of honor.

08:56.782 --> 08:58.860
What's wrong with wanting
to see your own funeral?

08:58.860 --> 09:00.696
Besides, if you wait till you're dead
you don't get

09:00.696 --> 09:02.497
to hear all the great things
people say about you.

09:02.497 --> 09:03.504
Think about it.

09:03.539 --> 09:04.503
Daniel!?

09:05.970 --> 09:06.398
Denny!

09:06.433 --> 09:07.042
Lookin' good.

09:07.042 --> 09:08.877
Thank you. Do you wanna
come to my funeral?

09:08.877 --> 09:09.962
Oh, funerals are sad.

09:09.962 --> 09:11.171
Oh, this one's gonna be fun.

09:11.171 --> 09:11.891
Count me in.

09:11.914 --> 09:12.589
Tomorrow night.

09:12.589 --> 09:14.216
No can do. Busy.

09:14.299 --> 09:16.009
Rain check?

09:16.426 --> 09:18.219
Absolutely.

09:18.254 --> 09:20.013
He's a keeper.

09:22.057 --> 09:23.362
Denny's great.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.107
Yep.

09:24.268 --> 09:26.513
He doesn't hear a think
anyone says, does he?

09:26.513 --> 09:28.105
Nope.

09:31.608 --> 09:33.235
Ms Raines? How was your

09:33.318 --> 09:34.896
interview at Crane, Poole and Schmidt?

09:34.896 --> 09:36.161
Short.

09:36.196 --> 09:38.657
Docket number 667065,

09:38.740 --> 09:40.679
Commonwealth versus Irma Levine.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.661
One count of disturbing the peace.

09:42.661 --> 09:44.038
Your Honor, at this time the people

09:44.038 --> 09:45.473
would like to amend the complaint.

09:45.473 --> 09:47.146
We are charging Ms Levine with Penal

09:47.146 --> 09:48.834
Code two-seven-two, section sixteen.

09:48.834 --> 09:50.845
Open and gross lewdness
and lascivious behavior.

09:50.845 --> 09:52.215
Are you out of your mind?

09:52.215 --> 09:53.516
How do you plead Counselor?

09:53.516 --> 09:56.039
Time out. Your Honor,
that charge is a felony.

09:56.039 --> 09:58.719
This woman was arrested
as part of a political protest,

09:58.719 --> 10:01.245
there was nothing lewd
and lascivious about it.

10:01.245 --> 10:03.268
Read the statute. She violated it.

10:03.268 --> 10:04.273
This is absurd.

10:04.308 --> 10:07.661
If she is convicted she'll be forced
to register as a sex offender.

10:07.661 --> 10:10.512
Save it for the jury, counselor.
How do you plead?

10:10.512 --> 10:13.586
Even more not guilty than we were
prepared to plead a moment ago.

10:13.586 --> 10:15.611
Conference with the clerk
to set the trial date.

10:15.611 --> 10:16.995
Next case.

10:19.114 --> 10:20.461
Why are you doing this?

10:20.461 --> 10:21.243
I'm late.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.553
There were two hundred women
arrested that day.

10:23.553 --> 10:25.780
Are you going to charge them all
as sex offenders?

10:25.780 --> 10:28.806
We're going to see
how this case goes first.

10:40.477 --> 10:41.811
What the hell happened in

10:41.811 --> 10:43.229
your interview with Holly Raines?

10:43.229 --> 10:44.495
I don't like your tone.

10:44.495 --> 10:45.534
And you're square.

10:45.534 --> 10:47.484
Game over. Now what the hell happened?

10:47.484 --> 10:49.736
Didn't like her.
She was only here for the money.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.572
Brad! Everyone from the
senior partners to the

10:52.655 --> 10:55.408
assistant janitor
is only here for the money!

10:55.491 --> 10:57.846
Okay. Look. You had an affair with Tara.

10:57.846 --> 11:00.132
You paid your assistant to sleep with you.

11:00.132 --> 11:03.492
I'm a partner now, I'm not gonna let you
use this firm as an escort service!

11:03.492 --> 11:04.900
This was not about sex!

11:04.935 --> 11:06.273
It's about bribery!

11:06.308 --> 11:09.202
I had to offer her an interview to get
Catherine Piper off.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.609
Now you've made her mad and she's

11:10.609 --> 11:13.009
taking it out on another client of mine!

11:13.033 --> 11:14.595
What the hell are you doing?

11:14.595 --> 11:19.682
Strengthening my quads. Ski season.

11:35.032 --> 11:38.019
They say it was caused by stress from
the first Gulf war.

11:38.019 --> 11:39.527
But, whatever the cause,

11:39.610 --> 11:41.410
Brad Chase does indeed suffer

11:41.445 --> 11:44.024
from a severe case
of Irritable Bowel Syndrome

11:44.024 --> 11:47.611
and his gastroenterologist has told him
to take up sports to strengthen

11:47.611 --> 11:51.974
the gluteus maximus muscles
to control things back there.

11:51.975 --> 11:54.291
And this is the first I've ever heard
of it but apparently

11:54.291 --> 12:00.496
the high altitude of the ski slopes is
also good in helping to prevent leakage.

12:01.173 --> 12:02.541
Something to do with the thin air.

12:02.541 --> 12:04.873
So. Long story short I will get you

12:04.908 --> 12:07.241
another interview with a named partner.

12:07.241 --> 12:08.069
Thank you.

12:08.104 --> 12:08.722
You're welcome.

12:08.722 --> 12:11.425
Now, can you please charge Irma Levine

12:11.460 --> 12:13.556
with something reasonable?

12:13.591 --> 12:16.151
Or better yet just drop the whole thing.

12:16.374 --> 12:17.084
Can't do it.

12:17.084 --> 12:20.044
I'll never be able to guarantee you
a job but I promise…

12:20.044 --> 12:21.445
I know you think this is about me

12:21.445 --> 12:23.073
being mad at Crane, Poole and Schmidt,

12:23.073 --> 12:25.648
but it isn't. This comes straight from my boss.

12:25.648 --> 12:28.189
Why does the District Attorney care about this?

12:28.189 --> 12:30.054
He wants to set an example to

12:30.089 --> 12:32.619
discourage these kinds of protests.

12:32.654 --> 12:35.652
Ms Raines. If you convict Irma of this charge

12:35.687 --> 12:38.616
she'll have to register as a sex offender.

12:38.651 --> 12:42.731
She'll be lumped into the same group
as rapists and child molesters.

12:42.749 --> 12:44.279
All because of a political protest.

12:44.279 --> 12:49.888
How can this seem even remotely fair to you?

12:50.217 --> 12:51.992
It's out of my hands.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.978
Parson's trial. We're trying to plead this out,

12:55.978 --> 12:58.073
so I want you to research any cases

12:58.073 --> 13:01.026
involving deaths resulting from marital disputes.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.047
I'm on it.

13:02.431 --> 13:04.158
I do have a slight problem.

13:04.777 --> 13:06.812
There's an old woman in my office.

13:06.812 --> 13:07.660
Pardon?

13:07.695 --> 13:08.824
The sandwich lady.

13:08.859 --> 13:09.349
Catherine.

13:09.349 --> 13:11.034
She's taken over my office.

13:11.855 --> 13:13.512
Am I to understand that you,

13:13.512 --> 13:15.892
a lawyer working at one of the most

13:15.927 --> 13:18.163
prestigious firms in the Boston area,

13:18.198 --> 13:20.435
cannot negotiate with the sandwich lady

13:20.435 --> 13:21.955
to get her out of your office?

13:21.955 --> 13:23.410
Well, of course I can.

13:23.445 --> 13:26.799
I just don't wanna take up the firm's
billable time.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.292
You think this will take time?

13:29.327 --> 13:31.300
Well, no sir. I'll take care of it.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.203
Forget I said anything. Please.

13:39.646 --> 13:42.357
Shirley! Just the person I needed to see.

13:42.392 --> 13:44.525
I'm in a terrible bind and I

13:44.609 --> 13:46.659
need to borrow your breasts.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.815
All right. But have them home by eleven.

13:48.815 --> 13:52.267
I'm sure you've followed Irma Levine's
case in the news.

13:52.302 --> 13:52.749
I have.

13:52.784 --> 13:55.154
Then you know the D.A.,
or whoever is pressuring him

13:55.154 --> 13:57.413
is attempting to suppress political protests.

13:57.413 --> 13:58.414
Naked ones, yes.

13:58.498 --> 14:00.541
This is not a small issue, Shirley.

14:00.541 --> 14:03.419
This type of thing is going on
all over the country.

14:03.419 --> 14:05.759
They've banned roadside parking
and camping in

14:05.759 --> 14:08.854
Crawford, Texas to stop people from
protesting the war.

14:08.854 --> 14:10.671
If you criticize this administration,

14:10.671 --> 14:13.510
they just might reveal your wife is a CIA agent.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.812
Congress is creating a law that forces

14:15.847 --> 14:18.102
people with political blogs either register

14:18.102 --> 14:20.777
with the government or face potential prosecution.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.196
Little by little people are being silenced.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.564
I need your stature. Expertise.

14:25.599 --> 14:28.883
Cut the crap, Alan, it's about boobs and
you need a nice pair at the table.

14:28.883 --> 14:30.654
You are absolutely delicious when you

14:30.654 --> 14:32.353
cut to the heart of the matter like that.

14:32.353 --> 14:34.017
They are throwing everything at me, Shirley.

14:34.017 --> 14:35.937
I need to throw everything back.

14:36.128 --> 14:37.054
I'll think about it.

14:37.054 --> 14:38.017
Think fast.

14:39.423 --> 14:41.550
If I agree to help you, one condition.

14:41.550 --> 14:43.691
I assume during the course
of this case, breasts

14:43.691 --> 14:45.890
will be referred to
in many colorful ways.

14:45.890 --> 14:46.840
One would hope.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.651
Personally however I don't ever want

14:48.651 --> 14:50.392
to hear them referred to as ‘hooters’.

14:50.392 --> 14:51.775
I hate that word.

14:51.810 --> 14:54.239
Oh, and this is a little off topic,

14:54.274 --> 14:56.669
but I hate the word ‘underpants’ too.

14:56.856 --> 14:59.961
If I can have your breasts I promise not
to say, ‘hooters’.

14:59.961 --> 15:00.765
Thank you, Alan.

15:00.765 --> 15:02.899
Now, for underpants,
if you promise not to wear any…

15:02.899 --> 15:04.396
Goodbye, Alan.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.203
We advised her to put
her clothes back on,

15:14.203 --> 15:17.803
but she and her cohorts insisted
on marching around topless.

15:18.386 --> 15:18.984
And Officer Minden,

15:18.984 --> 15:20.724
The District Attorney's here.

15:21.666 --> 15:26.933
Scott Bodnar.  Politicians are drawn to
cameras like flies are drawn to…

15:26.968 --> 15:27.814
Politicians.

15:27.849 --> 15:31.299
And what was your reaction to the
defendant's toplessness?

15:31.299 --> 15:33.136
I was shocked. Offended.

15:33.171 --> 15:34.540
Were you the only one offended?

15:34.540 --> 15:34.924
No, ma'am.

15:34.924 --> 15:36.370
We've received numerous complaints from

15:36.370 --> 15:39.079
the community about the defendant's behavior.

15:39.114 --> 15:40.092
Thank you.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.013
Ms Levine and her cohorts, as

15:47.097 --> 15:49.099
you so colorfully referred to them,

15:49.099 --> 15:51.761
were there as part of a political
protest, correct?

15:51.761 --> 15:53.128
So she says.

15:53.163 --> 15:54.461
So she says…

15:54.496 --> 15:57.867
She was holding this sign.

15:57.902 --> 15:58.301
Yes.

15:58.336 --> 16:00.603
Not exactly the stuff erections are made of.

16:00.603 --> 16:01.491
Objection.

16:01.526 --> 16:02.635
Sustained.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.745
Isn't it true

16:03.780 --> 16:06.282
that more people paid attention once

16:06.366 --> 16:08.792
the protesters took off their tops?

16:08.827 --> 16:11.871
They drew a bigger crowd, that's for sure.

16:11.906 --> 16:13.373
Thank you.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.634
Then… Uh, one last thing.

16:17.669 --> 16:20.505
As a beat cop, who regularly pursues

16:20.588 --> 16:23.549
rapists, murderers and other violent criminals,

16:23.584 --> 16:26.511
and also as who protects the rights of the KKK

16:26.594 --> 16:28.887
and other provocative groups who

16:28.888 --> 16:31.139
are legally permitted to protest,

16:31.140 --> 16:33.120
can you sit up there and honestly tell us

16:33.120 --> 16:35.426
you were offended by a group

16:35.427 --> 16:39.148
of bare breasted protestors?

16:42.110 --> 16:44.904
They broke the law, Mr Shore.

16:44.939 --> 16:46.803
I find that offensive.

17:00.962 --> 17:01.702
<i>Shocked.</i>

17:01.702 --> 17:04.240
<i>Shocked and appalled that people would so</i>

17:04.240 --> 17:06.709
<i>blatantly flaunt our obscenity laws.</i>

17:06.709 --> 17:09.326
Whore. Any place there's a camera

17:09.361 --> 17:11.944
there's Bodnar having sex with it.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.916
Where have you been keeping your head?

17:13.916 --> 17:15.537
Around. I didn't see you on

17:15.539 --> 17:17.194
the balcony the other night.

17:17.194 --> 17:18.814
Bev and I had something to do.

17:18.814 --> 17:21.221
Then we did it again.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.483
Alan?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.529
I heard that you asked Shirley

17:26.529 --> 17:28.155
to be part of your dream team.

17:28.155 --> 17:29.272
Why her and not me?

17:29.272 --> 17:30.319
Shirley has breasts.

17:30.319 --> 17:32.403
Ours are just beginning to develop.

17:32.403 --> 17:34.944
You're starting this case off
on the wrong foot.

17:34.944 --> 17:35.704
How so?

17:35.746 --> 17:36.620
It's got everything.

17:36.620 --> 17:40.834
Sex, politics, everything
but one key ingredient,

17:40.869 --> 17:42.593
Denny Crane. I'm in.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.790
Denny, you don't even know
what this case is about.

17:44.790 --> 17:49.350
It doesn't matter.  I don't have to know
what it's about in order to try it.

17:53.972 --> 17:55.432
I want you out of my office.

17:55.432 --> 17:56.997
I'm an attorney, I graduated top of my

17:56.997 --> 17:58.637
class at Suffolk University Law School,

17:58.637 --> 18:00.917
I passed the bar exam the very first try

18:00.917 --> 18:03.197
and I was recruited by the best firms.

18:06.693 --> 18:08.561
I killed a man.

18:19.373 --> 18:22.125
Never seen those on TV.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.362
There's that whore!

18:25.337 --> 18:27.699
Watch out everybody the real whore's here.

18:27.699 --> 18:28.639
Denny!

18:29.299 --> 18:31.009
I don't have a tranquilizer gun so

18:31.009 --> 18:32.587
I'm going to have to reason with you.

18:32.587 --> 18:36.604
We agreed you could be on this case
only if you don't speak.

18:36.639 --> 18:38.975
Speak in the courtroom.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.158
Besides it's opportunities like this

18:41.158 --> 18:43.230
that make Crane, Poole and Schmidt

18:43.265 --> 18:46.552
Crane, Poole and Schmidt.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.444
Denny Crane. Ten cents a dance.

18:49.479 --> 18:51.071
Hey, Scott!

18:51.106 --> 18:52.078
Denny.

18:52.113 --> 18:54.908
I'd just like to say that most of

18:54.991 --> 18:57.709
us begin life suckling on a breast.

18:57.744 --> 19:00.455
If we're lucky we end life
suckling on a breast.

19:00.455 --> 19:04.415
Anybody who's against breasts
is against life itself.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.136
Denny Crane.

19:08.171 --> 19:11.257
Mr Crane! Mr Crane! Excuse me!

19:12.801 --> 19:14.272
Sir? Any comments?

19:14.719 --> 19:18.348
Ms Levine? Can you tell me what this is?

19:18.431 --> 19:21.611
It's a map of the Boston area
congressional district.

19:21.651 --> 19:24.050
This is district four.

19:24.085 --> 19:25.956
How would you describe its shape?

19:25.956 --> 19:28.015
It's shaped like a large intestine.

19:28.015 --> 19:29.969
Now, why would we, as a people,

19:30.004 --> 19:33.917
choose to shape a congressional district
like a large intestine?

19:33.952 --> 19:36.436
We don't. Our elected officials do.

19:36.471 --> 19:39.725
Say you voted for the incumbent
congressman last election,

19:39.725 --> 19:43.073
and I live on the opposite side of the
street and I voted against him?

19:43.073 --> 19:45.842
His party can draw the line down the
middle of the street

19:45.842 --> 19:47.583
to include you and exclude me.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.926
Can they really do that?

19:48.926 --> 19:51.461
With computer modeling they can be very exact.

19:51.461 --> 19:54.012
This isn't about boobs at all.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.583
It's foreplay. Wait your turn.

19:59.472 --> 20:00.945
Why did you start this group?

20:00.945 --> 20:04.531
To protest the war.
We had our shirts on then!

20:04.566 --> 20:07.259
There were nearly one hundred thousand
of us in the streets.

20:07.259 --> 20:08.432
A sea of people.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.105
But the local news reported

20:10.140 --> 20:12.153
that only a few thousand showed up.

20:12.153 --> 20:14.373
As if our protest didn't even happen.

20:14.478 --> 20:15.689
So what did you do next?

20:15.689 --> 20:18.224
We continued to protest with little effect

20:18.259 --> 20:20.159
and we eventually learned that

20:20.194 --> 20:22.095
in order to get your message heard

20:22.095 --> 20:23.521
you had to shock people.

20:23.521 --> 20:24.877
You had fantasies about this

20:24.877 --> 20:27.217
college girl? She nothing but a talker.

20:28.573 --> 20:30.568
A moment please, Your Honor.

20:31.794 --> 20:34.410
Denny, we're trying to work here.

20:34.445 --> 20:37.027
Give him your keys to play with.

20:38.050 --> 20:39.689
And finally, Ms Levine.

20:39.724 --> 20:41.359
What do you do for a living?

20:41.359 --> 20:42.890
I run a women's shelter.

20:42.925 --> 20:45.999
And if you are convicted and placed on

20:46.034 --> 20:49.073
the State's Sexual Offender's registry,

20:49.108 --> 20:50.554
what happens to you?

20:50.589 --> 20:52.001
I would lose everything.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.205
My job, my home, my standing
in the community.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.916
So. If one wanted to intimidate people

20:58.951 --> 21:01.364
from exercising their first amendment rights

21:01.364 --> 21:02.806
this would be a good way to do it?

21:02.806 --> 21:03.866
Objection!

21:03.901 --> 21:05.750
Nothing further.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.132
Ms Levine.

21:10.167 --> 21:13.513
Your laudable work for battered women
not withstanding,

21:13.548 --> 21:15.714
isn't it correct that you were arrested

21:15.714 --> 21:18.294
only when you illegally
bared your breasts?

21:18.598 --> 21:19.301
Yes.

21:19.336 --> 21:22.065
You could have continued to make that
same statement

21:22.065 --> 21:23.853
while keeping your clothes on?

21:23.853 --> 21:25.989
But the message wouldn't have gotten the
same coverage.

21:25.989 --> 21:27.171
So it's your contention

21:27.171 --> 21:28.732
that it's alright to break laws

21:28.732 --> 21:31.037
so long as you're trying to get a message across?

21:31.037 --> 21:33.084
I think that's a gross exaggeration.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.308
Our community has set standards and laws

21:35.308 --> 21:37.462
for what it deems to be indecent behavior.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.995
What our elected officials are doing is indecent.

21:39.995 --> 21:41.377
My breasts are not.

21:41.412 --> 21:43.885
You intentionally broke that law. Didn't you?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.250
I took my top off.

21:45.285 --> 21:47.235
In many cultures a woman's bared

21:47.270 --> 21:49.221
breasts are not considered indecent!

21:49.221 --> 21:50.138
But we're in America.

21:50.138 --> 21:53.618
In America we're allowed to set our own
laws.  Are we not?

21:54.984 --> 21:56.389
Yes.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.315
Nothing further.

22:19.569 --> 22:21.161
Your funeral's in a bar?

22:21.196 --> 22:23.490
Funeral homes close too early.

22:23.525 --> 22:25.575
And they don't have beer.

22:25.909 --> 22:30.497
Nice outfit, but I do believe I said
hockey casuals.

22:31.206 --> 22:33.055
I'm feeling a little like Alice

22:33.055 --> 22:34.869
down the rabbit hole right now,

22:34.869 --> 22:36.609
So I'm just gonna go with it.

22:36.669 --> 22:38.713
That's an excellent attitude.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.757
My family's gonna love you!

22:40.792 --> 22:42.208
Your family?

22:42.925 --> 22:44.452
It's my funeral.

22:54.645 --> 22:56.856
Come on, come on. Come on!

22:59.817 --> 23:02.215
Go! Go! Go spinny man! Go spinny man!

23:02.250 --> 23:04.614
Wow, you've really picked up the lingo.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.616
Yes! Ha! Ha!

23:07.617 --> 23:09.612
I had to let him win. It's his funeral.

23:09.612 --> 23:13.032
Aww, you got beat by a girl
and a dead guy. Deal with it.

23:15.207 --> 23:17.410
If I could have your attention…

23:20.671 --> 23:22.861
We have gathered here tonight

23:22.896 --> 23:25.051
to pay our final respects to…

23:25.134 --> 23:27.474
that guy who's eating the Buffalo wing.

23:28.763 --> 23:30.377
I know we look at Daniel and

23:30.377 --> 23:32.837
everyone here is thinking the same thing.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.269
“How much is he leaving me in the will?”

23:36.395 --> 23:38.901
Seriously, after our folks

23:38.936 --> 23:43.409
passed, Daniel was the one there for us.

23:44.063 --> 23:46.318
He always has been.

23:46.353 --> 23:48.574
And he always will be.

23:48.609 --> 23:50.781
To you. Bro.

23:50.816 --> 23:52.061
I love you.

23:54.788 --> 23:57.309
Now let's have some zamboni cake!

24:22.566 --> 24:24.484
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

24:24.902 --> 24:27.122
You know, you're wrecking my funeral?

24:27.314 --> 24:29.197
I know.

24:29.865 --> 24:31.867
We're here, and it's you, and

24:31.950 --> 24:33.869
your friends and your family.

24:33.910 --> 24:36.663
And it's like a beginning only you're…

24:36.698 --> 24:39.583
It sucks. That's it.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.967
It just sucks.

24:44.588 --> 24:47.356
This is good for you.

24:48.049 --> 24:52.894
And everyone in there is unbelievable.

24:52.929 --> 24:56.057
And I have been trying. I really have. But…

24:59.561 --> 25:01.396
But…

25:03.023 --> 25:06.671
you're dying and it's eating me up inside.

25:09.404 --> 25:12.866
Go back to your party.

25:38.933 --> 25:40.470
It's time for court, Denny.

25:40.470 --> 25:41.651
I'm not going.

25:41.686 --> 25:43.410
You took me to the circus and

25:43.410 --> 25:45.099
you didn't show me any elephants.

25:45.099 --> 25:46.447
I'm sorry.

25:46.482 --> 25:48.602
But I am going to call the D.A. to the stand.

25:48.602 --> 25:50.688
Well, that'll be fun. But it's not enough.

25:50.688 --> 25:52.036
Be careful of Bodnar.

25:52.071 --> 25:54.949
I'm not sure you want that whore as an enemy.

25:54.984 --> 25:57.410
By definition he's my enemy.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.540
He can't call the District Attorney.

26:02.540 --> 26:03.122
I just did.

26:03.122 --> 26:04.983
He was never included
in our witness list.

26:04.983 --> 26:06.938
The Commonwealth hasn't had
ample time to prepare.

26:06.938 --> 26:08.896
Your Honor, his testimony is relevant.

26:08.896 --> 26:10.756
This case is all about the railroading

26:10.756 --> 26:12.547
of my client's first amendment rights.

26:12.547 --> 26:15.418
And Mr Bodnar seems to be conductor
on the said railroad.

26:15.418 --> 26:16.750
It's a cheap stunt.

26:16.785 --> 26:17.217
Enough.

26:17.252 --> 26:20.479
I'm certain District Attorney Bodnar can
take care of himself.

26:20.479 --> 26:23.010
I'll allow his testimony.

26:25.688 --> 26:28.524
District Attorney Bodnar! Alan Shore.

26:28.559 --> 26:29.931
Before we start, I just

26:29.931 --> 26:32.296
wanna say I love those mailers

26:32.331 --> 26:34.662
you send out come election time.

26:34.697 --> 26:38.426
We're all inspired by the story of your roots,

26:38.461 --> 26:40.861
your father the Czechoslovakian cobbler,

26:40.911 --> 26:43.072
your mother the Czechoslovakian cobbler's wife.

26:43.072 --> 26:44.924
I also wanna thank you for

26:44.959 --> 26:46.741
taking the time to be here.

26:46.776 --> 26:50.212
You're a busy man keeping criminals off
the street,

26:50.247 --> 26:53.648
fighting for truth, justice and the American way,

26:53.683 --> 26:57.558
and yet you make time to be here.

26:58.149 --> 26:59.258
Every day.

26:59.293 --> 27:02.242
This case must be very important to you.

27:02.277 --> 27:02.780
It is.

27:02.815 --> 27:05.632
I guess the question
on all of our minds is, why?

27:05.632 --> 27:07.404
Well, Mr Shore, as you know

27:07.439 --> 27:09.179
this was defiance of the law.

27:09.212 --> 27:10.342
On a sizeable scale.

27:10.342 --> 27:11.920
It was extremely offensive

27:11.955 --> 27:13.499
to a large number of people.

27:13.499 --> 27:16.199
And there were a lot of TV cameras out there.

27:16.794 --> 27:18.320
And in here.

27:18.545 --> 27:20.293
The point is, Ms Levine's

27:20.328 --> 27:22.479
message was getting across! Wasn't it?

27:22.479 --> 27:24.699
That's why this case is so important.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.892
That's what's so frightening to you.

27:26.927 --> 27:27.999
The truth was getting out.

27:27.999 --> 27:30.334
The truth about the stranglehold

27:30.369 --> 27:32.169
you and other politicians have

27:32.194 --> 27:33.950
on our political system. Correct?

27:33.950 --> 27:36.768
Mr Shore. I was elected to represent the

27:36.803 --> 27:39.586
community and to act in their best interest.

27:39.917 --> 27:42.002
People have right to political speech.

27:42.002 --> 27:43.528
No matter how extreme.

27:43.563 --> 27:46.012
They do not have the right to break the law

27:46.012 --> 27:48.819
with lewd and lascivious behavior on the
streets of Boston…

27:48.819 --> 27:48.996
Yes…

27:48.996 --> 27:52.308
Mr Shore you asked me a question.
Please allow me to finish.

27:52.308 --> 27:53.734
I don't know what society you live in

27:53.734 --> 27:57.698
but our society has made it clear where
it stands on indecency.

27:57.733 --> 27:59.470
If you're looking for a litmus test?

27:59.470 --> 28:02.388
Just ask Janet Jackson.

28:06.505 --> 28:08.215
Well, congratulations, Alan.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.151
Your drilling of the D.A. on

28:10.186 --> 28:12.037
the stand has really paid off.

28:12.072 --> 28:13.968
The plea bargain he had set on the

28:13.968 --> 28:15.829
Parson's case suddenly got rejected.

28:15.829 --> 28:17.222
Gee, I wonder why?

28:17.257 --> 28:18.937
Mr Parson did kill his wife.

28:18.967 --> 28:20.510
I mean, he should go to jail.

28:20.510 --> 28:22.835
We are now known in the D.A.'s office

28:22.870 --> 28:25.986
as those SOB's from Crane, Poole and Schmidt.

28:26.021 --> 28:29.102
And for what? You are still losing this case.

28:29.185 --> 28:30.694
Paul, if that's all they're calling us?

28:30.694 --> 28:32.664
Clearly I've not done my job.

28:42.323 --> 28:43.943
I'm here! What do you want?

28:43.950 --> 28:45.528
Brad, would you agree that you owe me one

28:45.528 --> 28:48.360
for the egregious way you handled the
Holly Raines interview?

28:48.360 --> 28:49.569
Alan, her attitude was…

28:49.569 --> 28:51.581
The important thing is, I agree that you
owe me one.

28:51.581 --> 28:52.916
Just follow my lead.

28:55.044 --> 28:57.755
Mr Bodnar, we're gonna lose this case.

28:57.790 --> 28:58.756
Yes, you are.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.756
And I don't know what to do about it.

29:00.756 --> 29:02.697
We could get to the appeals process,

29:02.697 --> 29:04.569
but so many of our fine judges are

29:04.569 --> 29:06.956
not into the first amendment these days.

29:06.956 --> 29:09.029
And if by some miracle we make it
into the Supreme Court.

29:09.029 --> 29:11.707
Well they're not that tickled with
the first amendment either!

29:11.707 --> 29:14.768
So. As you can see. I am in a pickle.

29:14.803 --> 29:17.086
You didn't need to come down here
to explain that to me.

29:17.086 --> 29:18.332
No. I know.

29:18.589 --> 29:24.141
But I did need to explain this. It's Brad here.

29:25.735 --> 29:27.159
What about Brad here?

29:27.194 --> 29:31.406
He's decided he's going to run
against you for District Attorney.

29:32.873 --> 29:34.709
Really?

29:37.753 --> 29:38.257
Yes.

29:38.292 --> 29:41.716
I mean, I think he's a natural
for politics.  Don't you?

29:41.751 --> 29:43.474
Look at him. Gorgeous.

29:43.509 --> 29:45.475
And tough on crime. The man

29:45.510 --> 29:50.075
single-handedly rescued a kidnapped child.

29:51.517 --> 29:54.156
The Republican Party is bound to love him

29:54.191 --> 29:56.831
because he's so demonstratively pro-torture.

29:56.831 --> 29:58.664
A man who's not afraid to get his hands

29:58.664 --> 30:00.857
dirty while he cuts off the fingers of others.

30:00.857 --> 30:03.016
Oh! You're a Republican! Aren't you, Scott?

30:03.016 --> 30:03.696
Mr Shore.

30:03.731 --> 30:07.151
I wonder who your party'd rather have
carrying its standard?

30:07.151 --> 30:10.869
You? Or Captain Handsome?

30:11.036 --> 30:14.581
Brad, stand up and take your jacket off.

30:18.460 --> 30:21.178
Yes. Ooh. Good.

30:21.213 --> 30:23.882
Put it over the shoulder.

30:30.180 --> 30:31.563
Wow!

30:31.598 --> 30:34.371
I think this job is about more than looks.

30:34.406 --> 30:37.145
Well. You'd have to think that, wouldn't you?

30:37.229 --> 30:39.038
I notice the polls don't have you

30:39.038 --> 30:40.813
doing too well with women voters.

30:40.813 --> 30:42.783
You are aware my client runs

30:42.818 --> 30:44.655
a shelter for battered women?

30:44.690 --> 30:46.424
Do you think persecuting her will

30:46.424 --> 30:47.890
play well with the distaff side?

30:47.890 --> 30:49.501
Are you trying to threaten me?

30:49.501 --> 30:51.043
Not me. It's my friend here.

30:51.043 --> 30:55.259
This case has him so incensed! Doesn't it, Brad?

30:55.294 --> 30:55.661
Yes.

30:55.696 --> 30:59.176
It's inspired him to pluck his hat from
those beautiful blond

30:59.176 --> 31:01.088
locks and toss it into the ring.

31:01.088 --> 31:04.521
I can just see the two of you in a
televised debate.

31:04.556 --> 31:06.097
Not, really. I can only see him

31:06.097 --> 31:08.508
because you seem to fade
into the background.

31:08.508 --> 31:11.237
Tell me, Brad, how many
of your clients are millionaires?

31:11.237 --> 31:11.737
All of them.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.509
Rich coffers to draw from.

31:13.544 --> 31:17.941
It would be much nicer, wouldn't it
Mr Bodnar, to run unopposed?

31:21.606 --> 31:25.735
Well. You've both made
some extremely valid points

31:25.777 --> 31:27.654
and I think Goldilocks here

31:27.737 --> 31:29.801
would be a formidable opponent.

31:29.836 --> 31:31.866
I look forward to the campaign.

31:31.901 --> 31:36.074
And Mr Shore, I look forward
to seeing you in court.

31:41.543 --> 31:43.705
Brad, you know,
you don't actually have to run.

31:43.705 --> 31:45.769
On the other hand
you've made a powerful enemy,

31:45.769 --> 31:46.871
and I think you've learned a valuable

31:46.871 --> 31:49.217
lesson about following my lead.

31:49.252 --> 31:51.303
Thanks. Douchebag.

31:55.265 --> 31:56.641
Hey!

31:57.183 --> 31:58.893
Hi!

31:59.227 --> 32:02.480
So? How was the rest of your funeral?

32:02.515 --> 32:04.282
Oh, it was great.

32:04.317 --> 32:06.049
It totally bombed.

32:07.485 --> 32:09.877
So? Are we okay?

32:11.155 --> 32:15.868
Daniel. I am the worst coward there is.

32:15.903 --> 32:17.745
Yeah. Well. We all avoided you

32:17.829 --> 32:19.664
then, when we were playing quarters.

32:19.664 --> 32:21.791
No.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.935
I can't keep going.

32:26.629 --> 32:28.798
Okay, time out.

32:28.881 --> 32:30.733
Don't decide anything just yet. Okay?

32:30.733 --> 32:33.591
Because I got something.

32:34.971 --> 32:37.076
Look, I'm going to Switzerland.

32:37.515 --> 32:39.970
They got this experimental treatment in

32:40.005 --> 32:42.425
St Moritz that I… scammed my way into.

32:43.813 --> 32:45.850
And I don't know if it's gonna work.

32:45.850 --> 32:48.726
But I figure it's worth a shot.

32:49.693 --> 32:53.615
And if it does, I'll be back.

32:54.316 --> 32:57.201
And then decide. Okay?

32:58.244 --> 32:59.641
Okay.

33:14.218 --> 33:16.806
You're going off like a dog aren't you?

33:19.264 --> 33:20.480
What do you mean?

33:20.724 --> 33:23.525
When a dog knows it's gonna die

33:23.560 --> 33:27.564
he goes off into the woods by itself and uh,

33:27.599 --> 33:30.673
rich guys go to St Moritz.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.376
They have beautiful woods there.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.625
Yes, they do.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.934
I'll see you, Guido.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.232
See ya.

34:00.222 --> 34:02.182
Ms Levine took her shirt off.

34:02.217 --> 34:04.316
That is not in dispute.

34:04.351 --> 34:06.916
And she did it to make
a political point.

34:06.951 --> 34:09.516
Now people make political points every day.

34:09.516 --> 34:11.560
The TV, the press, on the internet,

34:11.560 --> 34:13.985
expressing opinions of all kinds

34:14.069 --> 34:16.487
without breaking the law.

34:16.523 --> 34:18.150
For Ms Levine, our country's

34:18.150 --> 34:21.291
guarantee of free speech wasn't enough.

34:21.326 --> 34:24.364
Our guarantee of freedom of assembly?
Wasn't enough.

34:24.364 --> 34:26.643
And apparently our guarantee of

34:26.679 --> 34:28.924
freedom of the press wasn't enough.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.538
None of these freedoms
were enough for Ms Levine

34:31.538 --> 34:33.880
and the point she had to make. No.

34:33.915 --> 34:36.027
She had to break the law by

34:36.062 --> 34:39.391
violating our community standards of decency.

34:39.427 --> 34:42.722
No one violated Ms Levine's freedom of speech!

34:42.757 --> 34:47.851
Ms Levine violated our community laws.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.897
Don't let her get away with it.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.987
Jake Watson convicted of

34:58.071 --> 34:59.920
molesting an eight-year-old girl.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.741
Served two years, then convicted of

35:01.741 --> 35:03.701
molesting an eleven-year-old girl.

35:03.701 --> 35:07.205
John Bauers, convicted of multiple counts of rape.

35:07.246 --> 35:10.875
Calvin Stevens, convicted of sodomizing and

35:10.910 --> 35:14.504
molesting over a dozen boys ages six to ten.

35:15.254 --> 35:17.792
This is a list of registered sex-offenders.

35:17.792 --> 35:19.652
This is the list the prosecutor

35:19.675 --> 35:21.469
thinks Ms Levine should be put on.

35:21.469 --> 35:26.015
This is the company they think she belongs in.

35:26.265 --> 35:27.607
Do you?

35:27.642 --> 35:30.402
Do any of you think that a woman who

35:30.437 --> 35:33.163
bared her breasts at a political rally

35:33.792 --> 35:35.352
poses the same risk to the

35:35.366 --> 35:38.903
community as rapists and child molesters?

35:39.035 --> 35:42.695
Of course you don't.  And I'll let you
in on a little secret.

35:44.033 --> 35:45.333
Neither do they.

35:45.368 --> 35:48.496
You see they arrested Ms Levine and the
other women

35:48.531 --> 35:51.651
before and charged them
with ‘disturbing the peace’.

35:51.707 --> 35:54.585
When a woman is arrested for

35:54.668 --> 35:57.505
sunbathing topless in a public park,

35:57.588 --> 35:59.676
she's either charged with disturbing

35:59.676 --> 36:01.694
the peace or more likely the cop says,

36:01.694 --> 36:06.554
“Hey, lady put your shirt back on”. And
then he goes off to deal with real crime.

36:06.805 --> 36:08.898
So why is Ms Levine different?

36:08.933 --> 36:12.519
Because she was protesting redistricting.

36:12.554 --> 36:13.832
Now, I know that may sound

36:13.832 --> 36:17.031
arcane and theoretical to you.

36:17.066 --> 36:20.194
But I assure you that to the politicians in power,

36:20.229 --> 36:22.988
there is nothing more dear to their hearts.

36:23.023 --> 36:24.780
If Ms Levine had written a scholarly

36:24.780 --> 36:27.987
article about redistricting
for an obscure journal

36:28.022 --> 36:30.319
that nobody would ever have read, the

36:30.354 --> 36:32.062
District Attorney wouldn't have cared at all.

36:32.062 --> 36:35.053
But she and the other women

36:35.088 --> 36:38.045
made their argument topless.

36:38.128 --> 36:39.921
People paid attention
because, let's face it,

36:39.921 --> 36:41.609
when two hundred women take their

36:41.609 --> 36:43.227
tops off, people are going to look.

36:43.227 --> 36:46.195
But after they've gawked for a minute
they might ask,

36:46.195 --> 36:48.415
“Why have they taken their tops off”?

36:48.847 --> 36:52.404
And then they might find out
it's because of redistricting.

36:52.893 --> 36:55.958
And then they might say, “Well, what is that?”

36:55.993 --> 36:58.573
And then when they find out they might say,

36:59.121 --> 37:04.442
“Oh my God!  Our politicians have
highjacked our Democracy”.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.211
The prosecutor charged Ms Levine

37:07.246 --> 37:12.746
for violating our community standards.

37:13.133 --> 37:15.255
This is Boston.

37:15.290 --> 37:17.924
Home of the Tea Party.

37:17.959 --> 37:20.622
Home of the people and the spirit of

37:20.657 --> 37:24.341
freedom that literally created this country.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.648
Our community standard is that we

37:26.683 --> 37:29.081
won't be silenced by the King of England,

37:29.081 --> 37:30.799
much less the District Attorney!

37:30.799 --> 37:34.979
Our community standard is that we speak
the truth to power.

37:35.101 --> 37:39.272
And if those in power don't like it…

37:39.564 --> 37:41.816
…too bad.

38:00.668 --> 38:03.441
Oh, look at you. This is terrible.

38:04.526 --> 38:06.154
I'll tell you what I'll do, Garry.

38:06.154 --> 38:06.608
Garrett.

38:06.608 --> 38:08.978
I'm not in the office all the time.

38:09.013 --> 38:11.296
I mean I'm very busy over lunch and

38:11.331 --> 38:13.635
morning break and afternoon coffee.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.907
That would leave three or four hours

38:15.942 --> 38:18.144
when I won't need the office at all.

38:18.179 --> 38:20.451
Make yourself at home.

38:20.486 --> 38:22.142
Thanks.

38:22.177 --> 38:26.557
So you can be in there all during lunch
when you eat your two sandwiches.

38:26.569 --> 38:27.603
Two sandwiches?

38:27.638 --> 38:28.449
Oh. Yes.

38:28.484 --> 38:30.747
You'll be buying two sandwiches off the cart.

38:30.747 --> 38:32.111
The ones that aren't moving.

38:32.111 --> 38:34.983
Usually it's liverwurst and tongue.

38:35.628 --> 38:36.815
Bye.

38:38.956 --> 38:41.678
Joke's on you! I like tongue!

38:46.964 --> 38:49.467
Will the defendant please rise?

38:53.095 --> 38:55.618
Has the jury reached unanimous verdict?

38:55.653 --> 38:56.994
We have, Your Honor.

38:57.029 --> 38:58.224
What say you?

38:58.225 --> 39:01.062
In the matter of the Commonwealth versus
Irma Levine,

39:01.062 --> 39:04.023
on the count of open and gross lewdness
and lascivious behavior,

39:04.023 --> 39:05.558
we find the defendant,

39:06.026 --> 39:07.555
not guilty.

39:07.590 --> 39:09.000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury

39:09.000 --> 39:10.541
we thank you for your services.

39:10.541 --> 39:11.809
Courts adjourned.

39:14.408 --> 39:16.243
Congratulations.

39:16.493 --> 39:17.597
I think you're closing made all

39:17.597 --> 39:19.404
the difference. Thank you very much.

39:19.404 --> 39:21.176
You're welcome. And about your protest.

39:21.176 --> 39:23.047
Next time try pasties.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.673
Well? Alan?

39:30.049 --> 39:31.849
Thank you.

39:31.884 --> 39:35.904
You're not actually going to say goodbye
to me in public courtroom?

39:36.215 --> 39:38.515
Walk me out?

39:42.936 --> 39:46.148
Excuse me? This elevator's taken.

39:58.910 --> 40:00.704
Oh my.

40:03.790 --> 40:06.584
Suddenly I'm feeling all the hope

40:06.619 --> 40:09.379
and the anticipation and the ever so

40:09.463 --> 40:12.340
slight trepidation of election day.

41:05.727 --> 41:09.522
Ugh! What is this?

41:09.814 --> 41:11.482
Diet Scotch. It's Bev's idea.

41:11.482 --> 41:14.527
She wants me to slim down for the wedding.

41:20.908 --> 41:23.578
I've been wondering, Denny. Are we drifting?

41:23.613 --> 41:24.155
Drifting?

41:24.190 --> 41:24.819
Apart.

41:24.854 --> 41:25.456
Apart?

41:25.491 --> 41:26.177
Yes.

41:26.212 --> 41:27.731
No!

41:27.766 --> 41:29.250
Good.

41:37.550 --> 41:39.670
I'm gonna miss you, Denny once you're married.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.602
I'm not going anywhere.

41:41.637 --> 41:44.932
I've been married. Of course you are.
