WEBVTT

00:13.685 --> 00:15.445
God, I love the pub!

00:17.205 --> 00:20.725
It's just a place where everyone's equal,
everyone's your friend, you know?

00:20.805 --> 00:22.365
-Hello, Ken.
-Oh, bollocks!

00:22.445 --> 00:23.965
I followed you here for some bro-time.

00:24.045 --> 00:26.445
High on my agenda
is me marrying your sister

00:26.525 --> 00:29.445
and finally penetrating your family unit,
let's make this happen.

00:29.525 --> 00:32.125
Hark! It's Ken Thompson!

00:32.885 --> 00:35.405
-Sorry, do I know you?
-I have a gift for knowing people.

00:36.405 --> 00:39.765
-I know Graham, for example.
-Graham, whose actual name is Steve?

00:39.845 --> 00:40.765
I will speak.

00:41.765 --> 00:43.085
Ken Thompson,

00:43.165 --> 00:47.965
you will be the Liberal Democrat
parliamentary candidate for Lichfield.

00:48.045 --> 00:49.965
Right, that's very specific.

00:50.045 --> 00:54.125
And you, Graham, will invent
an award-winning sex toy

00:54.205 --> 00:56.565
called the Jolly Rooster. Haha!

00:56.645 --> 00:59.605
-Yes!
-Really? Very illuminating.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.285
-She's crackers.
-Yeah, I know.

01:03.045 --> 01:05.245
Although, fun fact,
my name actually is Graham.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.005
You what?

01:08.485 --> 01:10.365
Yeah, I changed it to Steve
by deed poll some time ago.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.525
I mean, Graham is just a bit boring.

01:13.285 --> 01:15.325
-So you mean she's actually--
-Yeah.

01:15.405 --> 01:16.685
How did you...?

01:19.765 --> 01:21.365
Hell's bells, Ken, she's gone!

01:23.765 --> 01:25.565
Oh, no, wait, she's over there.

01:36.685 --> 01:38.405
So you just need to sign here and here,

01:38.485 --> 01:40.165
and your divorce will be through
in ten days.

01:40.245 --> 01:42.085
-Congratulations.
-Wonderful!

01:42.165 --> 01:45.365
My brother said you were an expert
at this mindless clerical stuff.

01:45.445 --> 01:48.925
-Always nice to receive a compliment!
-There is this other little thing.

01:49.005 --> 01:52.445
I got this darling little letter
from UK Immigration.

01:52.525 --> 01:55.565
It said, "Ivy, your visa has run out

01:55.645 --> 01:58.445
and you need to leave the country
within 90 days!"

01:58.525 --> 02:00.165
So, what's that about?

02:00.725 --> 02:02.965
Well, I think it means your visa
has run out

02:03.045 --> 02:05.085
and you have 90 days to leave the country.

02:05.165 --> 02:08.365
But I can't go back to the States.
They'll pin Ron's crimes on me!

02:08.445 --> 02:10.245
So, what do I do?

02:10.325 --> 02:12.165
Well, you could get a job.

02:13.165 --> 02:14.965
Or you could get married
once the divorce comes through.

02:15.045 --> 02:17.405
There you go.
I'll marry a wealthy Englishman.

02:17.485 --> 02:21.125
Someone like Sean Connery
or Liam Neeson.

02:21.205 --> 02:23.765
Right, you do only have 90 days, though.

02:23.845 --> 02:26.245
Ninety more days than I need.
Are <i>you </i>a millionaire?

02:27.285 --> 02:28.765
Will you marry me?

02:28.845 --> 02:31.645
No, I'm with Tash.

02:31.725 --> 02:33.045
Although if I wasn't...

02:34.485 --> 02:35.925
Oh. Still no.

02:38.565 --> 02:40.365
She said <i>you'd </i>be an MP?

02:40.445 --> 02:43.005
Yeah. It was like a prediction,
like she'd seen it in a vision.

02:43.085 --> 02:46.085
-Spooky-kabooky!
-Did make me think, though.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.325
Remember when I was making waves
at the Lib Dems?

02:48.405 --> 02:49.965
Nina wanted me to be a councillor.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.045
-Till you took an E and puked on her!
-Yeah.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.045
I should have liked a life in politics.

02:54.125 --> 02:56.165
-You're going to go into politics?
-Oh, no.

02:56.245 --> 02:59.005
It's just something an old lady said
down the pub. It's nothing serious.

02:59.085 --> 03:01.725
Politics! Now, <i>that </i>would have made
Daddy happy.

03:01.805 --> 03:05.925
I worry what he would have thought about
you had he seen you living like this.

03:09.965 --> 03:12.365
Oh, well, hello!

03:12.965 --> 03:15.645
I am hoarse, I'm actually hoarse!

03:15.725 --> 03:17.525
-That was fricking awesome!
- Where were you?

03:17.605 --> 03:19.725
At a march to release
this innocent journalist.

03:19.805 --> 03:23.325
You renegades! Y'all have fun out there
shaking your rattles?

03:23.405 --> 03:26.205
Actually, we're fighting for the poor
and the oppressed, Ivy.

03:26.285 --> 03:27.765
Which is sort of you now, isn't it?

03:30.085 --> 03:32.405
Oh, Twitter's saying
that Douglas Markham's resigning.

03:32.485 --> 03:34.605
-Isn't he...?
-Our local MP!

03:34.685 --> 03:38.405
-There's going to be a by-election.
-Ken, don't. It's a coincidence.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.165
It's a bit weird, isn't it?

03:40.245 --> 03:42.005
That's exactly what that old woman said!

03:42.085 --> 03:44.485
Yeah, we probably shouldn't read
anything into it, though.

03:48.845 --> 03:49.765
Ken?

03:49.845 --> 03:52.565
It's Nina,
she wants me to come in urgently.

03:52.645 --> 03:54.765
She's something important
she wants to discuss.

03:54.845 --> 03:56.805
Spooky-kabooky!

04:00.805 --> 04:03.445
Well, I'd made the money
I wanted to make, Yusra,

04:03.525 --> 04:06.365
and I just really couldn't get on
with being an estate agent.

04:07.005 --> 04:10.565
Everyone's so grasping
and that's just not me.

04:10.645 --> 04:12.845
And working in a garden centre <i>is </i>you?

04:12.925 --> 04:16.765
I don't see any horticultural
experience here.

04:18.245 --> 04:20.445
Oh, I've got experience.

04:20.525 --> 04:26.085
Let's just say I used to look after
some pretty exotic plants.

04:27.285 --> 04:30.125
Your previous job was drug dealer?

04:30.205 --> 04:32.365
Well, drug dealer <i>and </i>grower, yeah.

04:32.925 --> 04:37.245
Well, isn't that marvellously dangerous?
I like a grower.

04:38.525 --> 04:41.005
Well, Dylan, you seem
a likely young man.
You could fit in here very nicely.

04:43.645 --> 04:46.885
Thing is, how do I know
if you're any good or not?

04:46.965 --> 04:49.845
Do you have a portfolio?

04:51.685 --> 04:54.165
Examples of your work?

04:54.245 --> 04:58.485
Well, I might have
an eighth of a portfolio.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.765
Mm.

05:04.525 --> 05:07.205
Just so you know,
this means you haven't got the job.

05:07.285 --> 05:08.965
Brilliant, I didn't want it anyway.

05:10.685 --> 05:14.845
Oh, wait, I'm going to slip
into something more interesting.

05:14.925 --> 05:16.765
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

05:16.845 --> 05:20.525
-You're going to love this.
-Am I? Am I going to love it?

05:20.605 --> 05:21.725
Oh, yeah, baby!

05:25.925 --> 05:28.845
-Nearly done?
-OK, I'm coming.

05:28.925 --> 05:30.405
Come on, I'm ready.

05:31.005 --> 05:33.445
So... what do you think?

05:36.205 --> 05:37.605
This is new.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.805
Sorry to hear
about Douglas Markham, Nina.

05:41.885 --> 05:43.645
Have you got a replacement yet?

05:43.725 --> 05:47.805
Well, difficult times
call for a fresh face,

05:47.885 --> 05:50.565
and I think that you, in particular,

05:50.645 --> 05:53.605
will be very surprised to hear
who we've gone for.

05:53.685 --> 05:56.205
Oh. Do I know them?

05:56.285 --> 06:00.005
It's a local colossus,
hitherto barely involved in politics,

06:00.085 --> 06:03.405
and someone not a million miles
away from this table.

06:05.205 --> 06:09.205
Wow! Nina! I don't know what to say!

06:09.285 --> 06:12.725
Yep. So, we are delighted
to announce that the candidate

06:12.805 --> 06:15.565
who's going to be fighting
this by-election is Yu...

06:15.645 --> 06:17.325
sra.

06:17.405 --> 06:18.605
Yusra Duncan.

06:19.205 --> 06:23.405
Sorry, I have terrible problems with
her name. She's a local businesswoman!

06:24.325 --> 06:27.165
Well, what was all that about
"not far from this table"?

06:27.245 --> 06:29.405
Oh, oh, yeah, her head office
is across the road.

06:29.485 --> 06:31.885
-Oh!
-Ken, you look very grumpy. What's wrong?

06:31.965 --> 06:34.445
No, no, it's fine, it's...
Well, I thought maybe
you had me in mind.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.725
You? Oh, my goodness!

06:39.805 --> 06:41.525
That's so...

06:41.605 --> 06:43.965
Oh, so funny!

06:46.165 --> 06:47.805
Oh, you!

06:47.885 --> 06:49.845
No, sorry, it's Yusra Duncan.

06:49.925 --> 06:52.485
Yeah, we had to make
a very quick choice, so...

06:52.565 --> 06:54.125
She's very popular
with our biggest donor.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.045
Do you know Gordon Andrews,
the poultry magnate?

06:56.125 --> 06:57.245
Yeah.

06:57.325 --> 06:59.525
He's hosting a big fundraiser for us
on Saturday.

06:59.605 --> 07:02.605
That's why I've called you in.
Come along, bring your family.

07:02.685 --> 07:04.005
-What, that's it?
-Mm.

07:04.085 --> 07:05.565
You said it was urgent!

07:05.645 --> 07:07.725
Oh, well, um...

07:07.805 --> 07:10.205
I must have meant "not urgent".

07:12.005 --> 07:13.725
Go away now, please.

07:14.765 --> 07:16.565
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.845
Very busy.

07:21.045 --> 07:22.245
Here he is!

07:22.325 --> 07:26.245
Do I see before me
the parliamentary candidate for Lichfield?

07:26.325 --> 07:27.525
No, you do not.

07:27.605 --> 07:31.125
Nina remains a psychopath and this
has been another wild goose chase.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.925
I would have been an amazing MP,

07:34.005 --> 07:37.525
and now she expects me to go
to some worthless fundraiser

07:37.605 --> 07:38.805
round at Gordon Andrews' house?

07:38.885 --> 07:41.005
-Well, it's not happening.
-Gordon Andrews?

07:41.085 --> 07:44.285
Dad, Andrews' chickens are reared
in windowless warehouses.

07:44.365 --> 07:48.405
-He is a monster!
-Yes, here he is! He's on the list!

07:48.485 --> 07:51.485
86, widowed, worth 40 million.

07:51.565 --> 07:52.765
He is perfect!

07:52.845 --> 07:55.285
-A chicken torturer?
-Who's 86?

07:55.365 --> 07:57.885
Oh, shush, both of you.
Can't a girl fall in love?

07:57.965 --> 07:59.285
Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

07:59.365 --> 08:02.205
Word has it he's sweet
on the chosen candidate, Yusra Duncan.

08:02.285 --> 08:04.765
Yusra Duncan! Let's have a look.

08:07.605 --> 08:09.365
Ha! No contest!

08:09.445 --> 08:10.845
Trust me, darlin',

08:10.925 --> 08:14.885
when that millionaire hears about
my milkshake, he's going to feel 75 again.

08:15.525 --> 08:17.005
Your milkshake?

08:18.125 --> 08:19.645
I need to pick out my outfit.

08:19.725 --> 08:20.925
And the dog's outfit.

08:21.005 --> 08:23.205
And she's put on a lot of weight lately!

08:23.285 --> 08:25.325
-It's a shame we're not going.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.765
All right, losers?

08:26.845 --> 08:29.045
Just brought some washing round for Mum.

08:32.485 --> 08:35.045
Hey, why are you looking
at Yusra Duncan?

08:35.125 --> 08:37.765
-Why, do you know her?
-Oh, I've seen her around.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.405
I mean, she's pretty fit for an old lady.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.125
Right?

08:42.205 --> 08:43.285
I suppose.

08:44.605 --> 08:45.925
Well, I shagged her.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.005
You did?

08:47.085 --> 08:48.485
Oh, horrible!

08:48.565 --> 08:53.365
And let me tell you,
she has got some pretty specific tastes!

08:53.445 --> 08:57.085
Oh, come on, Dylan, spill the beans!

08:57.165 --> 09:03.485
OK, so, she likes to do it
dressed up in teddy bear outfits.

09:03.565 --> 09:06.005
-Oh, my!
-Teddy bears?

09:06.085 --> 09:07.885
And you did it?

09:07.965 --> 09:11.045
Obviously, I did it, but, to be honest,
it was actually pretty comfy.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.365
-Oh, my God!

09:15.005 --> 09:19.525
Yes! Can't you see?
The path presents itself!

09:20.085 --> 09:23.085
Your rival is a fur-vert!

09:23.165 --> 09:26.045
That can't be normal,
not even in ye olde England.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.645
She's not my rival, Ivy.
I'm not even in the running.

09:28.725 --> 09:32.365
Ken, you're forgetting
your trump card, your sister!

09:32.445 --> 09:34.365
Now, we go to this party.

09:34.445 --> 09:36.765
I get the millionaire
to fall in love with me.

09:36.845 --> 09:40.125
You use the information to knock Yusra
out of the way!

09:40.205 --> 09:41.525
Bad-a-bing, bad-a-boom!

09:43.645 --> 09:44.605
No!

09:46.685 --> 09:49.085
Oh, shit, it might just work.

09:49.165 --> 09:50.765
I could still be an MP!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.445
No, no, no, it's immoral!

09:53.525 --> 09:55.125
And anyway, how would we prove it?

09:55.205 --> 09:59.205
Well, I mean, she did get me to film it,
if that helps.

10:02.725 --> 10:05.005
-Don't tell Lorna.
-£500.

10:09.445 --> 10:12.685
Gordon Andrews,
he takes a bird to market!

10:12.765 --> 10:16.245
Gordon Andrews,
he tortures chicken and turkey!

10:16.325 --> 10:18.125
Well, that's the last car
that's coming in!

10:18.205 --> 10:20.605
Yeah, the party's over, chump!

10:20.685 --> 10:23.205
-Come on, let's do this! Yeah!

10:28.925 --> 10:30.205
They're going to be so mad!

10:30.845 --> 10:32.765
They're going to be like,
"Why can't I get in?

10:32.845 --> 10:34.965
Oh, my God, I can't get into the party!"

10:35.045 --> 10:37.285
-Give me your phone.
-Here.

10:37.365 --> 10:39.165
No distractions.

10:44.205 --> 10:46.085
-You've hidden the keys, right?
-Yep.

10:46.165 --> 10:47.405
Swallowed them.

10:47.485 --> 10:49.565
What? Tash, you swallowed them?

10:49.645 --> 10:50.605
Yes, bruv!

10:50.685 --> 10:53.725
-They're going to have to cut us out!
-Tash, you mentalist!

10:54.885 --> 10:58.245
Gordon Andrews,
he takes a bird to market!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.565
-Gor--
-Tash?

11:02.045 --> 11:03.365
Shit! How did they get in?

11:04.325 --> 11:05.525
I don't know.

11:08.205 --> 11:09.925
Excuse me, hello...?

11:10.005 --> 11:12.485
Um, is this the main entrance?

11:12.565 --> 11:16.165
No, ladies, if you want the main entrance,
you have to go to the other side.

11:16.245 --> 11:17.525
Oh, OK, thank you.

11:23.685 --> 11:28.485
We must say thank you to you,
Gordon. It's a beautiful event.

11:28.565 --> 11:30.605
Thank you for your support.

11:30.685 --> 11:33.085
Spur your courage
to the stickin' place, Kenneth.

11:33.165 --> 11:35.685
Give me a half an hour
to enrapture the millionaire.

11:35.765 --> 11:38.085
-Then show the video to Nina!

11:38.165 --> 11:41.365
-Ivy, do you think this is a good idea?
-Well, why wouldn't it be?

11:41.445 --> 11:44.805
I'm about to blackmail someone
with a porn video starring my own son.

11:44.885 --> 11:47.165
It just seems a bit... sordid.

11:47.245 --> 11:49.285
-What's all this whispering about?
-Nothing.

11:49.365 --> 11:50.925
Just getting into the vibe of the party.

11:51.005 --> 11:54.485
Look at the balloons
and all the social democracy.

11:54.565 --> 11:57.485
-It's nice.
-Oh, Ken, lovely, you're here.

11:57.565 --> 12:00.405
-Come and meet our host.
-Here, take the dog.

12:05.445 --> 12:08.805
Ah, here you are
in this random corner of the room!

12:08.885 --> 12:11.565
Oh! Who's your hot friend?

12:11.645 --> 12:15.845
All right. Ivy, my sister.
This is Nina.

12:15.925 --> 12:18.085
Yeah, yeah, doesn't matter.

12:18.165 --> 12:21.285
-Are you Gordon Andrews?
-Yes.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.845
<i>Enchantée!</i>

12:24.565 --> 12:25.965
Oh, dear!

12:26.045 --> 12:27.765
My shawl!

12:35.445 --> 12:36.805
Are you married?

12:38.165 --> 12:40.325
So, you're a single guy?

12:40.405 --> 12:41.565
-Yeah.
-Oh!

12:41.645 --> 12:44.485
That is so rare in someone so handsome!

12:46.045 --> 12:48.445
Oh! Like you don't know!

12:50.325 --> 12:52.925
Stop staring at me that!

12:53.005 --> 12:55.445
It's like you're seducing me on the spot!

12:59.565 --> 13:02.085
Get the hell out of here!
I've got it, bitch!

13:05.205 --> 13:06.885
Look at us laughing together!

13:08.565 --> 13:11.045
Ooh! Ah! Gesundheit!

13:15.805 --> 13:18.725
Oi, it's going to be a shit night!

13:18.805 --> 13:20.325
Yeah! Poor chickens!

13:22.485 --> 13:25.645
-Oh! That's so rude!
-Really rude!

13:28.205 --> 13:29.685
I'm so sorry.

13:30.525 --> 13:32.445
Ben said he'd pick us up
about five, didn't he?

13:33.885 --> 13:34.925
Four hours.

13:38.805 --> 13:42.965
Tell you how we could use
the time constructively...

13:46.165 --> 13:48.165
-Yes, Tash!
-Yeah.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.765
-Have you got a lighter?
-Mm-hm.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.765
Ken, Ken!

13:58.845 --> 14:02.125
The old goat's hooked!
My divorce comes through next week.

14:02.205 --> 14:07.285
I'll be remarried in a month
and widowed pretty soon afterwards.

14:07.365 --> 14:10.245
Now it's your turn.
Nina's right over there.

14:10.325 --> 14:13.725
I don't know, all these underhand tactics.
It's just not me.

14:14.405 --> 14:16.605
This is your chance to <i>be </i>something

14:16.685 --> 14:19.885
and all you have to do is ruin
someone else's life!

14:19.965 --> 14:22.685
And if you don't do it, I will.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.605
-Nina?
-Yeah?

14:27.685 --> 14:30.045
-Could I have a word?
-Um, OK.

14:31.045 --> 14:32.045
Bye.

14:32.125 --> 14:35.565
This is all highly secretive, Ken.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.445
It's almost like
you're trying to seduce me.

14:37.525 --> 14:40.725
-That's not what this is at all.
-OK, right, well, what is it?

14:41.605 --> 14:45.405
- Well, Nina...
-Yep, Ken, spit it out.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.325
It's Yusra Duncan.

14:49.045 --> 14:53.605
I've got wind of a video of her having sex
with a man in his 20s.

14:54.405 --> 14:55.565
That's not all.

14:57.325 --> 15:00.685
-They're both dressed as teddy bears.
-Oh, my God, OK, um...

15:02.285 --> 15:05.325
Wow, Yusra Duncan's
an ursusagalmatophile!

15:05.405 --> 15:07.485
-Oh, it's got a name?
-Yeah, that's the name.

15:07.565 --> 15:11.045
-OK.
-And the voters really don't like them.

15:11.125 --> 15:12.365
Well...

15:13.165 --> 15:17.605
I may have acquired the video,
and, let's just say...

15:18.805 --> 15:21.885
I would hate for it
to get into the wrong hands.

15:21.965 --> 15:25.285
Absolutely, absolutely,
Yusra's campaign would be dead on arrival.

15:25.365 --> 15:27.085
-It would be a disaster.
-Oh, I know.

15:27.165 --> 15:29.485
-Cataclysm, so...
-Yeah.

15:30.445 --> 15:34.165
OK. Right, well, thank the Lord
this isn't going to go any further.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.125
-Right, I'd better start the auction.
-Whoa, whoa, wait!

15:39.685 --> 15:41.605
How do you know it's not going
to get into the wrong hands?

15:41.685 --> 15:44.725
Well, I mean, you said yourself
you're the only person with the video.

15:44.805 --> 15:46.845
Yes, I know what I said, but...

15:46.925 --> 15:50.005
What if it were to happen by accident?

15:51.645 --> 15:53.445
Well, that's highly unlikely.

15:53.525 --> 15:57.365
OK, well, what if I did it deliberately?

16:01.525 --> 16:03.445
What, you, blackmail her?

16:04.165 --> 16:06.405
That's wonderful!

16:06.485 --> 16:08.485
Good, kind, beautiful Ken?

16:08.565 --> 16:11.885
Would you do something so dastardly?
No, that's never going to happen!

16:15.045 --> 16:16.045
It was a joke.

16:17.845 --> 16:20.485
Oh, you're so funny, Ken, you are!

16:20.565 --> 16:22.405
OK, bye, see you later!

16:32.045 --> 16:33.445
I think that's done.

16:33.525 --> 16:36.245
I do not need any more of that!

16:42.325 --> 16:46.005
You know when Ben told me
that he was still mates with his ex?

16:46.085 --> 16:48.805
I was not happy.

16:48.885 --> 16:52.245
I was, like... "warning signs!"

16:52.325 --> 16:54.965
Yeah, totally.
You're just, like, "Bitch alert!"

16:56.725 --> 16:59.485
And I was, like,
"Please, don't let her be pretty!"

16:59.565 --> 17:01.965
And then I saw you, and...

17:03.565 --> 17:05.165
Obviously, you're gorgeous.

17:06.685 --> 17:08.205
Yeah, I really am.

17:09.565 --> 17:12.685
You keep telling people.
I like that character trait!

17:13.925 --> 17:16.205
And then we got to talking
and I was, like, "Woah!

17:16.285 --> 17:18.685
This is incredible, we're the same!"

17:18.765 --> 17:20.085
We are the same.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.485
-The same, there is no difference.
-There is no difference.

17:29.325 --> 17:32.005
So what did you think of me
when we first met?

17:32.085 --> 17:33.325
What did I think?

17:35.285 --> 17:38.125
-I thought you were hitting on me!

17:38.205 --> 17:39.205
What?

17:40.365 --> 17:43.805
-Oh, God, cos we met in that coffee shop?
-Yeah.

17:43.885 --> 17:45.725
But then I saw you with Ben and...

17:46.285 --> 17:48.405
I realised you were
just being really nice.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.205
You know, cos that's what you're like.

17:53.765 --> 17:54.885
You're just really, really--

18:24.925 --> 18:26.285
Tash!

18:32.205 --> 18:35.845
-I give pleasure to people.
-Oh, absolutely, good for you.

18:35.925 --> 18:37.925
-Must go and see other people.
-OK, OK.

18:39.605 --> 18:44.645
Been chatting to that Yusra Duncan.
She is just lovely!

18:44.725 --> 18:46.805
Yeah, a typical politician, isn't it?

18:46.885 --> 18:49.325
All smiles, aren't they?
Then they sell their own grandma.

18:49.405 --> 18:51.525
-Oh, no, her grandma's dead.
-Well, there you go.

18:51.605 --> 18:55.005
And not just her grandma.
Her husband died a few years ago, too.
She said he was really funny.
He was one of those football mascots.

19:00.685 --> 19:04.405
She said she tries to remember him
in every way she can.

19:04.485 --> 19:05.525
Right!

19:06.245 --> 19:10.085
Well, thank God no one's going to see
a video of her dealing with <i>that </i>pain.

19:10.165 --> 19:11.245
-What?
-Hm?

19:11.325 --> 19:13.765
-Ken, are you OK?
-Yeah. No, I'm fine.

19:13.845 --> 19:17.165
Do you know what, Lorna?
I think I might try and be an MP one day.

19:17.245 --> 19:20.685
I think I'd be good at it,
but I want to do it the right way.

19:20.765 --> 19:21.885
Bully for you, Ken.

19:24.005 --> 19:27.365
-What would be the wrong way?
- Testing, testing, one, two, three.

19:27.445 --> 19:29.485
Come on, let's sit down.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.805
Welcome, everybody.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

19:32.885 --> 19:34.925
It's nearly time for the auction.

19:35.005 --> 19:36.925
And I would love to thank Gordon

19:37.005 --> 19:41.125
for his amazingly generous donation
of these antiques.

19:43.885 --> 19:46.725
First, I know that you're all very,
very much looking forward

19:46.805 --> 19:48.885
to meeting our new candidate.

19:48.965 --> 19:52.685
And here she is. Yusra Duncan!
Come up, Yusra!

19:57.045 --> 19:59.525
- Now, of course...
-How did it go with Nina?

19:59.605 --> 20:01.685
Fine. Common sense prevailed in the end.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.285
You chickened out. I knew you would.

20:04.365 --> 20:06.325
Don't worry,
your big sister looked after it.

20:06.965 --> 20:08.045
What do you mean looked after it?

20:08.125 --> 20:10.845
I swapped the files
on the computer back there.

20:11.405 --> 20:13.285
-You didn't.
-Of course I did.

20:13.365 --> 20:15.885
I'm not going to let you be
a loser all your life.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.365
They're about to play the video

20:17.445 --> 20:20.765
that'll introduce everybody
to their new candidate!

20:21.525 --> 20:27.765
...And here it is, a video to
introduce everybody to our new candidate.

20:27.845 --> 20:30.965
And you're all going to see
a new side to Yusra.

20:31.565 --> 20:34.765
Oh, God, no, no!
I've got to stop it, I've got to stop it!

20:34.845 --> 20:37.485
- Ken!
-So, after Yusra's said a few words,

20:37.565 --> 20:41.645
we'll watch a little video and then
we'll get on with the auction, OK?

20:41.725 --> 20:44.005
So, speech, Yusra!

20:45.965 --> 20:48.925
I just want to say it's been great
to meet you all.

20:49.005 --> 20:51.045
And with that, I'll hand back to Nina.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.125
-Is that it?
-OK.

20:53.205 --> 20:55.525
-Well, all that needs to be done...
- No, no, no!

20:55.605 --> 20:59.565
...is for me to work out which button
on this remote to press.

20:59.645 --> 21:02.125
OK, stop, stop!

21:02.205 --> 21:03.085
Sorry!

21:03.165 --> 21:04.925
Ken, what are you doing?

21:05.005 --> 21:07.245
-I'm sorry, I want to make a speech.
-What?

21:07.325 --> 21:09.965
-Hello, Lib Dems!

21:11.085 --> 21:13.005
I said, hello, Lib Dems!

21:13.085 --> 21:15.725
- Hello.
-Hello. How's everyone doing?

21:15.805 --> 21:18.045
- Yeah, good.
-Whoo! Lib Dems!

21:18.125 --> 21:21.045
- Whoo!
- Good, isn't it?

21:21.125 --> 21:24.485
Hello, I am Ken Thompson.

21:25.645 --> 21:27.285
Do not adjust your sets.

21:27.365 --> 21:28.565
I am this big.

21:28.645 --> 21:30.525
-And I am this handsome.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.845
Ha! Now, listen,
Yusra is a fine candidate.

21:34.925 --> 21:37.965
I know, when it comes to raising money
for the Lib Dems,

21:38.045 --> 21:41.045
there is no magic money tree,
there isn't.

21:41.125 --> 21:45.005
But there is such a thing
as a money plant.

21:45.085 --> 21:48.445
And I bought six of them
at Yusra's garden centre earlier!

21:48.525 --> 21:50.845
-Cos that's what she makes happen.

21:50.925 --> 21:53.005
That's hilarious!

21:53.085 --> 21:55.045
Yeah! Thank you, sir.
Where are you from?

21:55.125 --> 21:56.525
Er... Redditch.

21:56.605 --> 21:59.645
Redditch! Whoa!
You want to get some cream for that!

21:59.725 --> 22:01.565
-"Redd-itch"!

22:01.645 --> 22:05.285
-At least I'm not from Itch-field, mate.
-Itchfield's good as well!

22:05.365 --> 22:09.565
-That's good. Say some more!
-Er, anyone in from Rashburn?

22:09.645 --> 22:12.285
Rashburn! Love it!
Not as good, but still funny!

22:12.365 --> 22:14.045
Try and think of some more.

22:14.125 --> 22:17.565
Don't press that button. You're
about to show the video, the furry video!

22:17.645 --> 22:19.805
-The furry video?
-Yes, the furry video!

22:19.885 --> 22:23.045
-How did they get hold of the furry video?
-I don't know. Sabotage.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.245
-Sabotage?
-What's going on?

22:25.325 --> 22:29.925
Yusra, I'm sorry, but your enemies have
got hold of some incriminating material.

22:30.005 --> 22:31.765
Oh, God, no!

22:31.845 --> 22:35.285
-Is it the midget gardeners?
-What? No!

22:35.365 --> 22:37.045
-The bear suit?
- Yes.

22:37.125 --> 22:39.845
-Oh, what have I done?

22:39.925 --> 22:41.685
-Ken, you'd better give me the mic.
-OK.

22:43.725 --> 22:46.445
All right, hey, pack it in.
Yusra needs to speak.

22:46.525 --> 22:48.725
Yusra, please, come on now.

22:49.365 --> 22:50.925
Hello again, everyone.

22:51.005 --> 22:54.525
Um...
I've got something I have to tell you.

22:54.605 --> 22:58.405
Um, you know,
when you go through a hard time in life,

22:58.485 --> 23:02.165
you cling on to any kind of comfort -

23:02.245 --> 23:04.045
soft,

23:04.125 --> 23:07.845
warm, furry comfort.
And when I feel lonely, um...

23:12.925 --> 23:15.925
I can't do this.
Friends, I can't be your candidate.

23:16.005 --> 23:18.845
-I'm going to step down.

23:19.725 --> 23:24.405
Of course, who you pick to succeed me
is up to you.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.205
-I'm sorry.
-Yusra...

23:28.205 --> 23:30.085
What about Ken Thompson?

23:30.165 --> 23:33.085
That's a great idea,
I like funnyman.

23:33.165 --> 23:37.605
-Ken.
- Ken! Ken! Ken!

23:39.565 --> 23:40.925
Wow!

23:41.005 --> 23:43.525
Yes, Ken Thompson!

23:43.605 --> 23:48.365
You have been selected to be
the next Liberal Democrat candidate!

23:52.885 --> 23:56.285
-I knew he could do it.
-Will you marry me?
-Oh! I thought you would never ask.

24:00.805 --> 24:03.485
My divorce comes through in a week.
Can you live that long?

24:03.565 --> 24:06.125
I mean, wait that long?

24:06.205 --> 24:08.445
Ken! Ken! Ken!

24:08.525 --> 24:11.565
Thank you, thank you.
I don't know what to say.

24:12.685 --> 24:16.925
I suppose, what I can promise is,
as your new candidate,

24:17.005 --> 24:19.045
there will be a gentler politics.

24:19.725 --> 24:22.365
And Yusra leaves
with her reputation intact.

24:22.925 --> 24:26.925
No one needs to ask what happened,
who said what, who blackmailed who?

24:27.005 --> 24:28.965
Let's just move forward,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:29.045 --> 24:31.605
Let's move forward together.

24:31.685 --> 24:35.485
-Together with dignity.
-Wow, a round of applause for Ken!
