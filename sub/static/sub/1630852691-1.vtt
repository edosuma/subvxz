00:21.208 --> 00:24.458
<i>Outer space. It's all around us.</i>

00:24.541 --> 00:26.875
<i>A diffuse mass of infinity.</i>

00:26.958 --> 00:29.750
<i>The universe is teeming</i>
<i>with darkness and mystery.</i>

00:29.833 --> 00:32.458
<i>95% of it is completely unknown to us.</i>

00:37.541 --> 00:40.791
<i>Only when the universe</i>
<i>sometimes shows us its potential</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.333
do we get a sense of what it may contain.

00:44.416 --> 00:48.000
One such time was 17 years ago
when the universe came to Middelbo.

00:48.750 --> 00:53.000
<i>Middelbo, the world's most mundane suburb</i>
<i>on the outskirts of Denmark.</i>

00:53.583 --> 00:57.166
<i>A rich shipping town which hit the skids</i>
<i>when they closed the shipyard.</i>

00:57.666 --> 00:59.666
When the yard closed,
so did everything else.

01:00.541 --> 01:02.125
Middelbo was going down.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.291
<i>But on 22nd February, 17 years ago,</i>

01:05.375 --> 01:09.791
<i>on the exact day Hussein</i>
<i>closed down his grocery store forever,</i>

01:10.291 --> 01:12.958
<i>a meteor landed in the vegetable aisle.</i>

01:16.916 --> 01:18.958
<i>That was the turning point for Middelbo.</i>

01:19.750 --> 01:22.500
<i>People came from all around</i>
<i>to see the Middelbo Crater.</i>

01:24.250 --> 01:25.625
<i>Hussein was a smart man.</i>

01:25.708 --> 01:27.791
<i>He made souvenir meteor snow globes.</i>

01:29.125 --> 01:32.458
<i>He had T-shirts printed,</i>
<i>caps and cups made. This created jobs.</i>

01:33.333 --> 01:35.500
<i>Suddenly,</i>
<i>Middelbo was a tourist attraction.</i>

01:35.583 --> 01:37.041
<i>That's why we are here today.</i>

01:38.333 --> 01:40.916
From Middelbo to Meteorbo.

01:43.750 --> 01:44.750
Thank you.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.541
Have a great day,
and thanks for listening.

01:50.958 --> 01:52.500
I want to hear more about the meteor.

01:53.916 --> 01:55.583
There's nothing more to tell.

01:55.666 --> 01:58.041
But you didn't really say anything.

01:58.958 --> 02:01.458
You just talked
about the grocer and Middelbo.

02:01.541 --> 02:04.666
If you want more information,
then visit the museum.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.958
But I'm asking you.

02:07.291 --> 02:11.208
Sure, and I'd like to answer
all of your questions.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.000
-Is that it?
-Yes.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.541
Can such a small rock
make such a big crater?

02:18.125 --> 02:21.250
Yes, because you can see
the giant crater it made.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.958
It's hard to believe.
It doesn't look like a real meteor.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.208
Are you some kind of meteor expert?

02:29.791 --> 02:32.750
-Any other questions?
-You don't know what you're talking about.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.583
Can I touch it then?

02:36.166 --> 02:38.916
-Of course not.
-But you're sure it's real.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.541
It won't break if it's real.
Why can't I touch it then?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.916
Because the sign says, "Don't touch."

02:45.000 --> 02:47.375
Because they know it's not a real meteor.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.708
I know your type.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.125
You think you're smarter
than everybody else

02:53.208 --> 02:55.458
because you know
how to run a Google search.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.500
But, in reality,

02:57.583 --> 03:00.541
you're just a sad little boy.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.250
I'll tell my teacher you hit me.

03:03.958 --> 03:05.791
Jesus, you're annoying.

03:11.666 --> 03:13.166
I'll give you two seconds.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.791
Be careful!

03:31.875 --> 03:32.833
It wasn't me.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.291
<i>You let him touch the rock!</i>

03:52.666 --> 03:55.333
-I didn't know it would break.
-It says…

03:59.291 --> 04:02.708
-I can put it back together.
-You're doing no such thing.

04:02.791 --> 04:04.750
You're staying well away from it!

04:05.250 --> 04:07.958
People come from all over to see the rock.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.083
Not so many right at this moment.

04:11.166 --> 04:15.541
People come from all over to see the rock!

04:15.625 --> 04:17.541
You know that's not true.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.458
Sorry.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.083
You're fired.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.208
What?

04:29.833 --> 04:30.833
Just go.

07:24.958 --> 07:26.750
Did you seriously smash the meteor?

07:28.958 --> 07:30.333
It wasn't me.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.958
It's super odd
if meteors are made of glass.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.541
What are you talking about?

07:38.041 --> 07:38.916
Look.

07:39.666 --> 07:40.791
What's that?

07:42.250 --> 07:44.208
Parts of the rock.

07:44.708 --> 07:45.791
But that's glass.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.333
A meteor isn't made of glass.

07:48.416 --> 07:51.916
-I don't know what they're made of.
-Not glass, that's for sure.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.166
Nobody lies about a rock.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.125
Everybody lies.

08:01.208 --> 08:04.625
My parents aren't at a country inn.
They're at a swingers' club.

08:10.750 --> 08:11.958
I need more.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.083
Jonas?

08:30.333 --> 08:31.541
-Hi, baby.
-Hey.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.291
No, you stink of puke.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.541
Well, I just puked.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.500
But guess what?

08:41.583 --> 08:42.916
I can still drink more.

08:50.416 --> 08:53.750
I just spoke to Zannie.
She says the meteor is a fake.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.416
Stop it.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.458
So, the meteor is fake?

09:00.166 --> 09:02.708
I think I'll call Hussein and tell him.

09:05.791 --> 09:07.458
What if he cancels the town fair?

09:08.291 --> 09:10.000
Why would he cancel it?

09:10.083 --> 09:13.750
If you tell him the meteor is fake,
he may not want to have a fair.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.916
If it's fake, he already knows.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.375
Emma, can't you just be normal sometimes?

09:18.458 --> 09:20.541
-Everyone thinks--
-What does everyone think?

09:21.958 --> 09:25.458
They think
you're really, really nice, Emma.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.708
And I think so too.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.666
Let's just party, okay?

09:57.541 --> 09:58.916
<i>You've called Hussein.</i>

09:59.000 --> 10:03.333
<i>Leave a message or drop me an email</i>
<i>at bigboss@middelbomuseum.dk</i>

10:03.416 --> 10:04.500
It's Emma.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.916
Could we talk about the rock?

10:07.416 --> 10:10.791
Because it may not be a meteor.
It might be made of glass.

10:11.666 --> 10:13.666
And then it's a fake, right?

10:15.083 --> 10:16.750
I'd like to talk to you about it.

10:34.541 --> 10:35.375
Hey!

10:50.375 --> 10:52.875
THE MIDDELBO CRATER

11:07.125 --> 11:08.250
Good morning, honey.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.333
Good morning.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.666
-Did you sleep well?
-I can hardly remember.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.333
I got up a long time ago.

11:15.416 --> 11:16.416
Cool.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
I heard you got fired from the museum.

11:24.375 --> 11:28.208
-It wasn't my fault.
-Of course not. It never is.

11:29.958 --> 11:32.583
How many jobs have you had this past year?

11:33.625 --> 11:35.166
I don't remember.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.208
Five, Emma.

11:40.791 --> 11:42.250
Five jobs in one year.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.625
This is different.

11:46.708 --> 11:47.708
How so?

11:48.583 --> 11:50.041
This wasn't my fault.

11:50.916 --> 11:54.208
It's ridiculous to fire me
when they were the ones who lied.

11:55.541 --> 11:56.708
What are they lying about?

11:58.041 --> 11:59.041
The meteor.

12:02.541 --> 12:03.833
It was made of glass.

12:04.416 --> 12:06.166
Have you told anyone about the meteor?

12:07.791 --> 12:10.291
No. I haven't said anything to anyone.

12:11.291 --> 12:13.458
All right, good. Leave it alone.

12:17.416 --> 12:19.083
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

12:31.916 --> 12:32.916
There you go.

12:37.833 --> 12:40.000
I'd like some more pills.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.791
You have enough for two weeks as usual.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.500
I think I have to increase my dose.

12:44.583 --> 12:48.458
I think I need to hear a bit more
about your mental state then.

12:51.708 --> 12:53.250
Could you tell me about it?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.916
It's just this town, you know?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.333
It's like

12:59.416 --> 13:01.333
everyone's pissing me off all the time.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.208
How do you do it?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.583
How do I do what?

13:14.625 --> 13:15.708
How do you survive?

13:16.583 --> 13:17.541
This town.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.791
All of this without going nuts.

13:20.791 --> 13:22.125
Well…

13:23.000 --> 13:25.333
I focus mainly on myself.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.958
But you're a teenager. That's different.

13:30.791 --> 13:31.625
How so?

13:31.708 --> 13:34.000
When you're a teenager,

13:34.750 --> 13:37.416
you're either part of something,
or you're against it.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.000
You're against it right now.

13:44.541 --> 13:46.041
You'll be okay, Emma.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.000
Most of us are.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.333
One a day.

13:56.708 --> 13:57.541
Thanks.

13:57.625 --> 13:58.666
-See you.
-Yes.

14:06.291 --> 14:07.291
Emma!

14:19.458 --> 14:20.541
Would you get in, please?

14:22.416 --> 14:23.500
Do I look like an idiot?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.250
Hussein wants to talk to you.

14:26.958 --> 14:28.000
Okay.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.541
Can you ride your bike to him then?

15:35.000 --> 15:35.833
Welcome.

15:37.916 --> 15:39.041
Can I have my job back?

15:44.333 --> 15:45.333
No.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.500
So, why am I here?

15:49.958 --> 15:50.791
Follow me.

15:53.791 --> 15:57.541
Did you know
that when most meteors hit the ground

15:57.625 --> 16:02.333
the force of the impact is so great that
they disappear when they hit the surface?

16:02.416 --> 16:04.125
They simply evaporate.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.083
Into tiny dust particles
carried away on the wind.

16:07.583 --> 16:08.750
Poof!

16:09.958 --> 16:10.958
Gone.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.208
So the meteor is a fake?

16:13.791 --> 16:15.958
-It's a symbol.
-Yes, of a lie.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.375
-It's not a lie.
-It is, if you made the rock.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.708
You can't fire me
for destroying a fake rock.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.125
Drink tickets?

16:43.208 --> 16:44.875
Go to the fair tonight.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.041
Have a good time.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.750
That'll get you free drinks all night.
Not just you. Your friends too.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.833
Seriously?

16:56.916 --> 16:59.541
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Pretend it didn't happen.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.083
Okay?

17:13.958 --> 17:14.958
Hi, babe!

17:15.750 --> 17:16.916
Hi!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.208
Where are you going?

17:19.291 --> 17:20.666
Just home to Nik's.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.166
Are you excited?

17:24.958 --> 17:26.666
-What about?
-The fair.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.208
Let's get wasted, yeah?

17:29.291 --> 17:32.291
Cool. And fortunately
I have all these drink tickets.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.625
Where did you get them?

17:34.541 --> 17:37.458
Hussein tried to bribe me with them
when I said he was a liar.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.958
-Did you speak to Hussein?
-Yes.

17:40.041 --> 17:41.375
And he's a real jerk.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.750
But I told you not to speak to him.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.791
-It doesn't matter.
-It totally does!

17:47.708 --> 17:51.291
We have one day a year in this shithole
that's actually a good day.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.208
One day!

17:53.291 --> 17:55.208
And you can't fucking ruin it.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.958
I just don't think people should lie.

17:58.458 --> 18:01.666
I think you're really
crossing boundaries right now.

18:02.541 --> 18:03.541
Okay.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.833
Every time you think something is a lie,

18:07.916 --> 18:10.750
we all have to pay for it
and then we're not allowed to have fun.

18:11.708 --> 18:14.416
Do you think
that you always just want to have fun

18:14.500 --> 18:17.458
because you're petrified
of taking a good look at yourself

18:17.541 --> 18:19.291
and doing something with your life?

18:23.291 --> 18:26.083
Do you remember when I said
everyone thinks you're super nice?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.750
That was a big, fat lie.

18:30.541 --> 18:33.750
Everybody thinks
you're a giant pain in the ass!

18:33.833 --> 18:36.291
You can stick the fair
where the sun doesn't shine.

18:37.791 --> 18:39.791
Does that mean you're not coming?

18:41.333 --> 18:42.541
I love you!

19:12.791 --> 19:13.750
Are you ready?

19:14.458 --> 19:15.666
I'm not going.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.041
Of course you're going.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.708
I don't want to.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.083
It's a tradition.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.541
We're having candied apples.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.791
We'll laugh at drunk people.
All the stuff we always do.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.583
I can't.

19:29.708 --> 19:30.541
Okay.

19:33.958 --> 19:34.958
Okay?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.250
Yes, it's fine.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.791
"I, Emma…"

19:47.583 --> 19:48.500
No.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.458
"…hereby grant my mother

19:51.083 --> 19:54.958
permission to decide three things
I have to participate in every year

19:55.041 --> 19:57.500
until I leave home. Love, Emma."

19:57.583 --> 20:01.125
-I was 13!
-So what? You're still living at home.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.916
I call a Mom veto.

20:06.125 --> 20:07.125
See you in a minute.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.291
Holy crap. They taste so bad.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.958
I always forget that I don't like them.

20:38.958 --> 20:40.500
That's traditional too.

20:40.583 --> 20:43.125
-It's like biting into red cement.
-No, it's delicious.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.791
You've got to be kidding me!

21:05.708 --> 21:07.000
What are you doing?

21:08.458 --> 21:09.458
Hi, babe.

21:10.375 --> 21:11.833
I didn't think you were coming.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.000
So you decided to make out with Noreen?

21:14.083 --> 21:16.083
I thought you wouldn't find out.

21:17.666 --> 21:19.375
That's a hell of an excuse.

21:21.583 --> 21:22.500
What about you?

21:22.583 --> 21:24.458
-Me?
-Yeah.

21:24.541 --> 21:27.208
Why are you doing it?
You're not interested in him.

21:27.291 --> 21:28.125
Calm down!

21:28.875 --> 21:29.708
Fuck you.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.250
Emma!

21:42.458 --> 21:43.625
Hey!

21:46.333 --> 21:47.208
There you go!

22:01.291 --> 22:04.375
Did you know they were snogging?
Jonas and Noreen?

22:05.416 --> 22:06.583
Everything's fake!

22:09.166 --> 22:10.375
Dear Middelbo.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.791
Thank you for coming out tonight.

22:13.416 --> 22:19.625
Today, I have the great honor
of presenting the man who'll save us all.

22:20.541 --> 22:23.541
Thomas Damborg, the future of Middelbo.

22:28.541 --> 22:29.791
Having a great night, huh?

22:29.875 --> 22:33.250
Thanks a million.
It's an honor to be here.

22:33.333 --> 22:38.000
I represent Astraeus,
an international hedge fund

22:38.083 --> 22:41.708
with a long tradition of
finding the diamond in the coal mine.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.500
We believe that, together,

22:45.041 --> 22:48.791
we can turn Middelbo into
the center of shipping in Northern Europe.

22:49.541 --> 22:53.541
We believe that this town
has the identity, the sheer cohesion,

22:53.625 --> 22:57.375
and the experience passed down
from generations of shipyard workers

22:57.458 --> 22:59.583
since the start of the last century.

23:00.708 --> 23:03.583
Middelbo will show everyone
that we can build anything.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.125
A proud town hit by the universe.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.458
This created unity.

23:12.041 --> 23:12.916
Hello!

23:13.416 --> 23:14.541
Hello!

23:18.541 --> 23:19.750
Sorry?

23:21.291 --> 23:23.666
Don't you get that it's all a fucking lie?

23:24.583 --> 23:27.625
-What?
-He's a fraud.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.125
The meteor is fake.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.291
Thank you to our local stand-up comedian.

23:32.375 --> 23:35.791
If the youth of Middelbo
has not yet drunk us dry,

23:35.875 --> 23:37.958
the bar over there
is very reasonably priced.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.291
Have a good evening. Thanks.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.375
MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WALL
WHO IS THE WOBBLIEST OF THEM ALL?

24:28.125 --> 24:29.916
<i>What do you know exactly, Emma?</i>

24:36.041 --> 24:37.166
<i>Tell us what you know.</i>

25:07.583 --> 25:08.583
Shit.

25:13.333 --> 25:14.375
Okay.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.791
I'm so wasted…

26:37.083 --> 26:38.083
Fuck!

26:39.208 --> 26:40.208
Ouch.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.500
Come on inside.

27:07.416 --> 27:08.416
Drink this.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.041
What am I doing here?

27:12.125 --> 27:13.708
You were asleep outside.

27:14.333 --> 27:18.083
It was freezing, so we helped you.
Or the vampire over there did.

27:19.291 --> 27:20.291
Vampire?

27:20.875 --> 27:21.708
Yup.

27:21.791 --> 27:24.916
Marie is 99% vampire.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.125
And the last percent?

27:27.708 --> 27:28.958
I don't drink blood.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.166
-You don't drink blood?
-Not yet.

27:33.916 --> 27:37.666
But aren't you 0% vampire then?

27:43.791 --> 27:45.208
I'm just going to go home.

27:45.291 --> 27:46.875
We'd like to talk first.

27:46.958 --> 27:50.625
I've already talked to your dad.
I know I have to shut up.

27:51.333 --> 27:52.958
But you don't have to shut up.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.666
You have to tell us what you know.

27:54.750 --> 27:58.041
-I don't know anything you don't know.
-Maybe. Tell us.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.791
How did you know about the meteor?

28:02.583 --> 28:04.041
It just broke, that's all.

28:04.125 --> 28:05.625
I don't know anything.

28:07.416 --> 28:09.291
-I told you so.
-What did you say?

28:10.208 --> 28:12.166
That it was all just a coincidence.

28:13.416 --> 28:14.708
What was?

28:14.791 --> 28:16.375
Elvis thought you knew something.

28:16.958 --> 28:19.125
It doesn't matter. See her out, Marie.

28:19.208 --> 28:20.166
Sure.

28:20.250 --> 28:21.250
Just go home.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.166
-She's cute, huh?
-Yeah.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.458
You said it.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.125
What are you doing?

28:33.875 --> 28:36.083
It doesn't matter. Just go home.

28:36.166 --> 28:37.500
No, I don't want to.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.291
Relax. She's okay.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.291
-You don't know that.
-Don't tell anyone, okay?

28:48.333 --> 28:50.041
Or she'll bite me?

28:52.250 --> 28:54.791
We know everything.
We know everything about you.

28:55.625 --> 28:56.916
We keep an eye on people.

28:57.458 --> 29:00.333
We're the only ones investigating
what's wrong in Middelbo.

29:01.666 --> 29:03.166
This town has secrets.

29:04.416 --> 29:05.708
We want to expose them.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.666
There are people
who were there 17 years ago.

29:08.750 --> 29:11.833
We know they were in the area
when the so-called meteor hit.

29:11.916 --> 29:15.583
-They saw it, but never said anything.
-How do you know they were there?

29:16.166 --> 29:17.208
We looked into it.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.708
Everyone of interest to us
was within a 500-meter radius.

29:21.583 --> 29:22.916
But they've kept it secret.

29:24.791 --> 29:25.625
Why?

29:26.708 --> 29:28.291
Because the truth is dangerous.

29:29.583 --> 29:32.250
They know it wasn't a meteor
that hit back then.

29:33.416 --> 29:34.916
Okay, so what was it?

29:36.125 --> 29:37.250
A spaceship.

29:41.208 --> 29:42.041
A what now?

29:42.125 --> 29:44.791
-Isn't that the term?
-A spaceship.

29:48.958 --> 29:51.458
All right. See you. I'm leaving.

30:08.666 --> 30:09.750
Seriously?

30:24.458 --> 30:25.833
You can't just reject it.

30:26.625 --> 30:27.666
Why not?

30:27.750 --> 30:28.750
Because it's true.

30:30.041 --> 30:33.625
Is your life such a comic book
that you actually believe

30:33.708 --> 30:37.125
that some sort of spaceship
landed in Middelbo 17 years ago?

30:37.208 --> 30:38.125
What if I tell you

30:38.208 --> 30:41.666
that three days ago there were rumors
of a signal from outer space?

30:41.750 --> 30:43.291
And that Middelbo replied?

30:44.541 --> 30:45.958
Sure, so what?

30:46.458 --> 30:49.333
What if I told you
Astraeus didn't exist a month ago?

30:50.583 --> 30:52.833
How did they grow so big so quickly?

30:53.500 --> 30:56.333
Something is really odd here.
I think it's worth looking into.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.291
There you are.

31:19.833 --> 31:20.791
I called you.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.333
Ten missed calls, Mom?

31:26.416 --> 31:28.166
Come on in, schnookums.

31:30.583 --> 31:32.541
CONGRATULATIONS

31:33.041 --> 31:34.291
Congratulations.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.375
Thanks.

31:36.041 --> 31:37.375
Did you forget?

31:37.458 --> 31:38.625
Yes. A little.

31:39.541 --> 31:42.375
I wasn't sure
if I should treat it as a kid's birthday

31:42.458 --> 31:45.833
or a hangover,
so there's birthday cake and chips.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.375
Yum.

31:51.125 --> 31:52.333
Seventeen years old…

31:53.875 --> 31:56.666
-I remember it--
-Like it was yesterday.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.416
Exactly. Your dad says happy birthday too.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.083
My dad doesn't know I exist.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.875
I'm sure he knows somehow, somewhere.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.333
What happened yesterday?

32:11.541 --> 32:12.500
Were you there?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.916
I left early,
but a lot of other people were there.

32:18.541 --> 32:20.083
I think I got a little bit drunk.

32:21.708 --> 32:24.250
-Didn't I tell you to leave it?
-You did.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.875
-It was probably stupid.
-Yeah, a bit.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.291
Everyone needs to believe in something.

32:33.666 --> 32:35.458
What if they believe in a lie?

32:36.791 --> 32:37.625
Then they do.

32:38.291 --> 32:42.375
You don't have to focus on that.
Just focus on what makes you happy.

32:43.125 --> 32:47.000
Yes. And that's not arguing
with people all the time.

32:47.083 --> 32:48.083
I know.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.625
It's not worth it.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.500
No.

32:52.375 --> 32:53.666
Put it behind you.

32:55.125 --> 32:56.125
Okay.

32:56.791 --> 32:57.750
Okay?

32:58.250 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, I'll put it behind me.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.083
-Promise?
-Yes.

33:05.833 --> 33:08.333
MIDDELBO SHIPYARD

33:28.375 --> 33:29.750
Great attendance, huh?

33:49.916 --> 33:53.083
Aren't you the girl
from last night at the fair?

33:56.083 --> 33:58.291
What was it? Something about the meteor?

33:58.375 --> 33:59.291
It was nothing.

34:00.791 --> 34:03.041
It was just something I thought I knew.

34:05.166 --> 34:06.791
Every time we discover something new,

34:06.875 --> 34:10.458
it turns out that what we thought
we knew yesterday is wrong today.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.500
And here you are.

34:14.416 --> 34:15.291
Yes.

34:16.583 --> 34:17.583
Would you like a tour?

34:18.833 --> 34:19.833
Yes, please.

34:23.416 --> 34:25.500
I'm actually looking for a job.

34:25.583 --> 34:27.416
You've come to the right place then.

34:28.791 --> 34:31.166
What kind of jobs do you offer?

34:32.291 --> 34:34.666
-Are you picky?
-No, I'm not.

34:35.625 --> 34:38.208
-But I am pretty difficult.
-We can always fire you.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.375
I've tried that before.

34:43.125 --> 34:44.708
What do you do exactly?

34:44.791 --> 34:45.833
We're building.

34:46.750 --> 34:47.666
It's a shipyard.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.250
Middelbo deserves
to return to its glory days.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.750
And you were founded a month ago?

35:01.541 --> 35:02.625
That's what I heard.

35:03.958 --> 35:05.375
You can look us up online.

35:09.125 --> 35:13.208
We've been on the verge of disappearing
a few times, but we're still here.

35:13.791 --> 35:15.208
And have been since 1875.

35:17.333 --> 35:18.791
Sure. Of course.

35:25.791 --> 35:26.791
Hi.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.250
Hi.

35:31.333 --> 35:32.333
What's up?

35:33.125 --> 35:34.875
I just signed up for a job.

35:36.333 --> 35:37.333
Come on.

35:37.916 --> 35:38.916
Where are we going?

35:40.791 --> 35:42.250
We're keeping an eye on someone.

35:43.166 --> 35:44.166
Come on.

35:45.875 --> 35:46.875
Okay.

35:47.750 --> 35:48.750
It's here.

35:51.208 --> 35:52.541
But that's my doctor.

35:53.833 --> 35:54.833
What's up with her?

35:55.833 --> 35:57.916
I told you. We're keeping an eye on her.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.041
Would you like a cracker?

36:11.833 --> 36:12.833
Sure.

36:21.125 --> 36:22.166
And happy birthday.

36:23.375 --> 36:24.416
What?

36:24.500 --> 36:26.000
Isn't it your birthday?

36:35.583 --> 36:36.583
Thanks.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.375
What do you think she knows?

36:52.750 --> 36:55.250
Susan was there 17 years ago.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.916
Maybe she'll reveal something
if we keep an eye on her.

36:59.333 --> 37:02.708
What would Susan reveal?
She's just a boring old doctor.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.041
If you really wanted to hide something,

37:06.125 --> 37:08.791
wouldn't you want to appear
as boring as possible?

37:10.916 --> 37:11.916
Like you, you mean?

37:14.458 --> 37:15.291
Yes.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.833
But why are we watching?

37:20.208 --> 37:21.958
Because everyone's got secrets.

37:27.166 --> 37:28.666
Mads and Elvis are…

37:30.125 --> 37:32.458
They're completely
consumed by this conspiracy.

37:34.541 --> 37:35.833
I'm actually not.

37:36.833 --> 37:38.875
I just like to watch people.

37:39.708 --> 37:41.416
The more I look,

37:42.125 --> 37:46.708
the more I realize
that everyone's as fucked up as me.

37:46.791 --> 37:48.458
And that makes me feel a bit better.

38:11.416 --> 38:12.500
What's going on now?

38:17.041 --> 38:17.958
Look.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.583
That's my biology teacher, Hans.

38:24.375 --> 38:26.375
Yup, you're right.

38:29.208 --> 38:30.791
Is she fucking around?

39:44.833 --> 39:48.416
