00:00.352 --> 00:02.553
Morocco!
Whoo!

00:03.761 --> 00:05.520
Holiday!

00:08.200 --> 00:09.880
I'm flying.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.600
Whoa, hang on...

00:13.720 --> 00:15.080
If you tell a soul

00:15.200 --> 00:17.001
I'll fucking kill you, all right?

00:17.121 --> 00:19.000
Screw you!
You mind fuck.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.160
What's going on, bro?

00:21.320 --> 00:24.320
I think maybe she can't do it.
Be with someone.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.240
When you pull,
the more she goes away.

00:26.519 --> 00:27.641
Come with me.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.040
Where?

00:29.160 --> 00:30.440
Anywhere.

00:30.759 --> 00:33.081
I have some friends who hides
drugs in empty houses.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.160
Yeah? Who?

00:34.320 --> 00:38.200
English boy. His name is Luke.
He is bad. Very bad.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.519
We want a favour.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.560
Why should I do anything for him?

00:40.721 --> 00:44.640
The girl. You've been fucking her.
Now Luke's going to fuck her.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.040
Come on. Stop them.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.120
What's going on?

00:48.281 --> 00:50.400
Slow down!
Matty, slow down!

00:50.520 --> 00:51.920
Stop the car.
Stop it!

00:53.360 --> 00:54.960
This is it!

00:55.120 --> 00:56.920
Why did he run like that?

01:47.600 --> 01:50.400
* Oh, woman, what's your problem?

01:50.520 --> 01:53.520
* I want you to tell me
that I've got some

01:53.800 --> 01:58.560
* When it is you who is the one
who in fact has some

01:58.680 --> 02:00.480
* Oh, you filthy woman

02:03.720 --> 02:05.481
* You're a filthy, filthy woman

02:05.601 --> 02:07.680
* You're a filthy, filthy woman

02:07.800 --> 02:11.520
* You filthy, filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy woman!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.640
Where are you going, buddy?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.200
Somewhere that smells
less like our balls.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.680
That is not balls, man,
that is soul lubricant.

02:34.840 --> 02:35.920
I'm pretty sure it's balls.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.640
O'Malley, please, yeah!

02:38.767 --> 02:41.538
Just one more, right?
It's right fucking there, man.

02:41.658 --> 02:42.640
I'm late for visiting time.

02:42.801 --> 02:45.720
Well, it's hardly visiting time
if Blood won't let you in.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.520
That's not the point.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.600
What if this is it, man,
the day we perfect Filthy Woman,

02:50.720 --> 02:53.400
get a contract and we start
the revolution, as discussed?

02:53.560 --> 02:55.880
And what if today's
the day she wakes up?

02:57.640 --> 02:58.920
Thank you.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.800
Hi, it's Grace,
smile and speak at the beep.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.840
Grace...

03:15.480 --> 03:17.040
It's me... again.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.280
Can you just wake up?

03:25.240 --> 03:26.560
I love you.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.840
Did you hear what I said there?

03:35.240 --> 03:36.760
I love you.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.440
Yeah?

03:39.840 --> 03:41.600
I fucking love you.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.160
Grace?

03:49.280 --> 03:50.760
Rich.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.880
Grace. Are you all right,
can you hear me?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.560
Why aren't you here?

03:57.680 --> 04:00.360
I... I tried. I tried.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.760
We all did.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.880
Your dad won't let us in.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.640
Then try harder, Richard.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.920
What?

04:24.120 --> 04:26.720
* Ain't no kid gonna realise

04:28.320 --> 04:31.800
* Change is forever turning by

04:33.560 --> 04:35.880
* Things are moving awfully fast

04:37.280 --> 04:40.480
* Grab your keys and grab that bag

04:40.640 --> 04:42.920
* We're going to follow

04:44.880 --> 04:47.560
* Follow your dreams

04:53.000 --> 04:54.920
Seriously, Richard?

04:55.040 --> 04:57.760
Are we seriously doing this again?

04:57.920 --> 05:01.040
Oh, come on, give me a break,
Pauline. She's the love of my life.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.040
Look... Two minutes
and I'm gone, yeah?

05:03.200 --> 05:04.840
The love of my life.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.199
I don't know, Richard.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.439
The love of my life.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
Stop saying that!

05:08.760 --> 05:10.000
It's working, though.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.520
Yes! No, no!

05:11.640 --> 05:13.920
Look. Why don't you...?

05:22.960 --> 05:26.240
Nurse, call security, tell them
that the boy has got in... again.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.360
Don't bother. I know the way out.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.000
This is exactly the kind
of blatant emotionalism

05:39.120 --> 05:41.400
we shan't have to deal
with in Switzerland.

05:41.561 --> 05:44.720
Grace might benefit from being
around people who love her.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.160
Professor Blood. Wait, please!

05:48.280 --> 05:51.680
He is inappropriate,
indecorous, inane

05:51.840 --> 05:53.240
and in a great deal of trouble.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.360
Don't you think this is a bit hasty?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.520
My daughter deserves the finest
medical care available

05:58.680 --> 06:00.640
and a clinic in Zurich
is the finest...

06:00.800 --> 06:01.439
Zurich?

06:01.559 --> 06:02.600
In all of Europe.

06:02.761 --> 06:06.000
I want her ready to leave for
Switzerland by this evening.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.840
Good day.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.000
* They don't care at all

06:11.160 --> 06:13.200
* At all, at all... *

06:21.960 --> 06:25.760
* Follow, follow your dream. *

06:26.000 --> 06:27.480
Grace.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.360
There's a door over there, you know.

06:42.920 --> 06:47.840
It's hard to explain. Involves your
crazy dad. He is crazy, you know.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.120
I'm disappointed. I thought you
would find your way in sooner.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.040
If you were worth your salt.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.440
Well... I'm here now
and that's the main thing.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.080
That's the main thing.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.120
Don't ever get ill on me again,
OK? I mean it.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.560
Like... ever.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.200
I mean it.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.560
OK.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.280
Dad's taking me
to Switzerland to get better.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.240
Yeah, I know.

07:20.600 --> 07:26.360
I probably really love you, Grace,
but your dad's a total bell end.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.840
I want you to think a way
out of the predicament, Richard.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.080
This is your moment
to show me what you're made of.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.320
Hmm.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
Promise me, Rich.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.560
I promise.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.360
Cool, get in here.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.000
What... now?!

07:44.160 --> 07:46.160
I'm horny, aren't you?

07:46.320 --> 07:48.360
Fuck it, yes.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.920
Come on, hurry up.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.040
All right, all right.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.560
Get in here.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
All right. All right.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.680
Oh, shit... sorry.

08:03.761 --> 08:05.120
Stupid fucking jeans.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.440
Mind my catheter.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.040
Shit, sorry.

08:14.160 --> 08:14.681
Whoops!

08:14.801 --> 08:16.760
What?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.680
Fuck off! Fuck off!

08:28.680 --> 08:30.640
Fucking come on, then.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.360
What about my...

08:39.840 --> 08:41.039
Fuckers!

08:52.680 --> 08:54.640
{pub}Richard!

08:54.760 --> 08:56.720
Sweetie!

08:58.560 --> 09:00.560
Richypoo!

09:01.840 --> 09:03.560
What?

09:03.680 --> 09:06.120
Surprise! We got you a ticket!

09:06.280 --> 09:07.721
You're coming to Halkidiki with us!

09:07.841 --> 09:09.480
I fucking well am not.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.640
Richard!

09:10.800 --> 09:11.840
Anita!

09:14.760 --> 09:16.720
Mr Blood called again today.

09:16.880 --> 09:21.080
I know you're worried
about Grace, poppet. We all are.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.600
How much have I spent on flowers
in the last two weeks?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.280
£11.49.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.720
£11.49, poppet.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.720
But you can't keep doing this
to that poor family.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.800
Give them some space, Rich.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.721
A holiday will do you
the world of good.

09:36.841 --> 09:38.721
And you'll make lots of new friends.

09:38.841 --> 09:41.480
We met some lovely young girls
banana-boating last year.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.400
Yeah? I'd rather hang myself.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.960
Kevin, unpack the bags.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.681
Anita, I'm sure he didn't mean...

09:49.801 --> 09:52.200
I said unpack the effing bags!

09:52.320 --> 09:55.320
Every single warning sign
Take A Break said to look out for,

09:55.440 --> 09:57.000
but you wouldn't listen!

09:57.160 --> 10:00.320
I will not come home to my baby
swinging from the rafters!

10:00.440 --> 10:02.520
Mum, I'm not going to actually...

10:02.680 --> 10:04.560
We will fix you, poppet.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.200
I know it hurts. Of course it does
but you'll move on.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.480
It's just young love.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.560
It's not real.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.040
Mum, I'm fine. She needs me here.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.600
If Blood wants me to stay away,
I'll stay away.

10:23.760 --> 10:25.480
But I'm not leaving. OK?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.720
If she's not on that flight
in four hours,

10:31.840 --> 10:34.520
I'm actually going to be forced
to kill myself.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.360
Are we clear, Kevin?

10:52.120 --> 10:56.520
* Another rose wilts in East Harlem

10:56.640 --> 10:59.600
* And uptown, downtown

10:59.840 --> 11:03.120
* A thousand miles between us

11:03.240 --> 11:07.480
* She's waiting for the night to fall

11:07.600 --> 11:10.120
* Let it fall

11:10.240 --> 11:13.760
* I'll never make it in time... *

11:36.320 --> 11:38.280
Mr Blood?

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
I've been thinking and, er...
you're right... about everything.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.280
Whatever you want for her,
whatever you want me to be, I'll be.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.760
Just don't take her away, all right?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.560
Mr Blood?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.240
No!

12:19.280 --> 12:21.440
No fucking signal! Fuck!

12:23.240 --> 12:25.040
Fuck!

12:35.400 --> 12:37.520
* I'm walking on sunshine, whoa!

12:39.480 --> 12:43.680
* I'm walking on sunshine, whoa!

12:43.800 --> 12:48.320
* I'm walking on sunshine, whoa!

12:48.480 --> 12:50.000
* And don't it feel good... *

13:15.200 --> 13:20.280
* You'll take me home tonight

13:22.000 --> 13:26.840
* We both know that

13:28.840 --> 13:33.520
* You hold my arm firmly

13:35.720 --> 13:40.920
* And say, "Oh, please don't leave"

13:42.560 --> 13:49.280
* Don't you worry
cos I'm staying here

13:49.440 --> 13:56.720
* Don't you worry cos I'm not leaving

13:56.840 --> 14:03.960
* Don't you worry
cos I'll stay here with you... *

14:05.600 --> 14:07.480
Don't worry, I'm here.

14:07.600 --> 14:13.760
* I'll stay here with you, with you

14:17.280 --> 14:24.360
* You say, "It's time to leave"

14:24.480 --> 14:29.840
* It's getting dark

14:31.760 --> 14:36.960
* Feet moving on their own

14:38.280 --> 14:44.360
* We trust they'll take us home

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
* Don't you worry
cos I'm staying here

14:53.160 --> 14:54.960
* Don't you worry...

14:57.040 --> 14:59.760
* ... cos I'm not leaving

15:01.800 --> 15:07.080
* Don't you worry
cos I'll staying with you... *

15:16.160 --> 15:18.320
Rich! Come on, Rich?

15:18.440 --> 15:19.880
Come on, Rich!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.600
Richard!

15:21.760 --> 15:23.760
I can smell you from out here, man.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.960
I've got weed!

15:37.560 --> 15:40.000
You've been man-tracked, bitch.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.160
Nice gaff. Where is she, then?

15:50.800 --> 15:52.760
Zurich?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.360
Like in space?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.480
It's in Switzerland.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.800
She's only been awake five minutes
and he takes her skiing?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.241
That is mental.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.840
She's at a clinic,
you subnormal twat.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.440
And he can do what he wants,
apparently.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.560
So let's go.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.040
Where?

16:11.160 --> 16:13.680
Zurich, man. Delta Force Rescue.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.920
I don't know where she is.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.680
Oh.

16:17.840 --> 16:21.080
So we'll just wait here
till she gets back, then?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.680
Et voila. Huh? That's Swiss.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.000
Cheers, mate.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.320
Give me...

16:48.040 --> 16:49.640
Oh, shit.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.040
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, mate.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.520
You motherfuck...

16:57.680 --> 16:58.639
Fucking hell.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.721
You fucking dickhead, man.

16:59.841 --> 17:01.880
I'm sorry. You want some?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.280
Yeah.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.040
It's massive. God, my chest.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.359
Whooooo!

17:18.079 --> 17:19.520
Boom-town!

17:19.640 --> 17:21.040
This is great, innit?

17:21.160 --> 17:22.800
I mean it's like being
on Bad Boy Island.

17:22.921 --> 17:24.319
Huh?

17:24.440 --> 17:28.319
Pinocchio! Our first squat.
This is it, man.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.521
This is where it all begins.

17:29.641 --> 17:31.640
What?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.160
The music revolution.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.560
Hang on. We're not going, er...

17:35.720 --> 17:38.600
Our first gig is going
to be a fucking blinder.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.200
You can't put a gig in a house.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.147
Right, firstly,
this isn't just any house.

17:42.267 --> 17:43.871
This is David Blood's house.

17:43.991 --> 17:47.040
Secondly, we need to fuck
his shit up.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.640
So come on!

17:51.720 --> 17:53.400
I do like fucking his shit up.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.000
Now you're talking.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.520
Swing away.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.480
Um...

18:06.200 --> 18:08.480
Yes, that's what I am talking about!

18:08.600 --> 18:11.560
Mindless anarchy. That's what
the kids are about nowadays!

18:11.720 --> 18:12.880
Wooo!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.160
Yeah!

18:14.320 --> 18:16.160
* Noo, na-noo noo na-noo noo

18:16.280 --> 18:17.800
* Na-noo noo na-noo noo...

18:22.680 --> 18:24.400
Stop!

18:24.560 --> 18:26.601
Come on, man. Let's go poo
on his bed!

18:26.721 --> 18:29.760
Shut it! Shut up!
Just shut it, shut up!

18:44.800 --> 18:46.520
Aargh. Fuck sake!

18:48.320 --> 18:49.999
What are you doing, buddy?

18:50.360 --> 18:51.800
Shut the fuck up.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.640
Fuck!

18:55.200 --> 18:56.600
No fucking signal.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.961
Do that thing where you put your sim
card on your forehead.

18:59.081 --> 19:00.200
Shut up.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.600
It proper works. Shitbox told me.
Listen you got to...

19:02.761 --> 19:05.160
What, Alo?
What the fuck do you want?

19:05.280 --> 19:06.680
I'm trying to help you.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.840
Well, don't!
I don't want any fucking help.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.280
No-one can help me
because I've got no fucking signal

19:12.400 --> 19:16.160
and I want to speak
to my girl... friend!

19:18.760 --> 19:20.680
I've got to find her.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.000
Have you checked the fridge?

19:26.120 --> 19:27.360
What?

19:30.080 --> 19:32.920
I know, I know. I am that good.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.000
OK. You have some uses.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.200
One, one, OK...

19:45.520 --> 19:46.081
Guten tag.

19:46.201 --> 19:47.800
Yeah, yeah, go, go.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.920
Willkommen zum Klinik Gotzmann.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.639
OK, I don't understand
any of those words.

19:53.561 --> 19:55.520
Yes. I'm trying to contact
Grace Blood.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.862
Grace Blood!

19:59.080 --> 20:00.760
No. Listen, please!

20:02.280 --> 20:04.600
Why does nothing work?

20:04.720 --> 20:06.560
Keep your gonads on!

20:06.680 --> 20:08.801
Guten tag.
Wie kann ich dir helfen?

20:08.921 --> 20:10.280
Er... yes!

20:10.400 --> 20:11.721
Entschuldigung.

20:11.841 --> 20:13.319
Ja, bonjour...

20:13.640 --> 20:15.080
Ich verstehe nicht.

20:15.200 --> 20:20.480
Ist der une... Um...
Grace Blood, por favor?

20:20.640 --> 20:23.640
OK, you're looking
for Grace, buddy. Ha-ha!

20:23.760 --> 20:27.160
Yes, I'm, er... Grace Blood...
I'm her brother.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.560
Ja cool. Putting you through.
Hold the line.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.040
Yes! Yes!

20:32.200 --> 20:34.840
Yes, you do love me,
you fucking love me!

20:34.960 --> 20:36.600
Come on! Yes!

20:42.521 --> 20:43.840
Grace!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.240
<i>This is unacceptable
behaviour, Hardbeck. It's futile.</i>

20:46.400 --> 20:47.360
Grace! Grace!

20:47.480 --> 20:49.329
- <i>Leave us alone!</i>
- Grace, can you hear me?

20:57.396 --> 20:59.200
I'm really s...

21:03.080 --> 21:05.000
Talk to me, man.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.600
Go home, Alo.
I want to be on my own.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.080
All right?

22:05.280 --> 22:07.480
The Wicked Witch...

22:15.440 --> 22:17.440
Don't grow up, Gracey.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.360
Wait, wait, hon...

22:44.480 --> 22:46.280
There, there?

22:46.400 --> 22:49.320
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.560
Oh, no. No, no, no.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.120
Wait, wait. Keep it there.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.120
Keep it there, fuck!

22:57.240 --> 22:58.880
Oh, fuck!

23:01.040 --> 23:03.160
No, wait, wait.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.600
You awful, awful bastards.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.160
Ah... Jesus and Mary...

23:07.320 --> 23:09.080
Can I just...

23:09.200 --> 23:11.760
You're on your own here, big boy.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.240
This is... This is horrific.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.599
Mate, I... She always makes
such a racket, honest.

23:16.719 --> 23:18.480
It's like a paddling pool got
punctured or something.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.480
Oh, cheers.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.160
You know what? Fuck the both of you.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.320
Er... Rich, why didn't you...

23:25.440 --> 23:27.240
Why didn't you call me?

23:27.400 --> 23:30.920
What, she wakes up and you just
don't bother to let me know?

23:31.080 --> 23:32.160
I lost my phone.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.840
I'm her best friend.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.800
Well, I'm sorry. I see you managed
to fill the emptiness inside, though.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.240
I wanted a fuck. He's available.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.000
Yeah. But you like me, right?

23:42.160 --> 23:45.480
Long as you don't talk,
yeah, it's all right.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.320
But this is a secret, right?

23:48.480 --> 23:49.920
Min, I don't give a fuck.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.280
Why don't you just wipe yourself
down and then piss off?

23:56.120 --> 23:57.121
That's my phone.

23:57.241 --> 23:58.920
Shut it.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.200
Fuck.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.960
I, er... I need some closure here.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.080
Yeah, go on, then.

24:11.760 --> 24:12.759
Rich?

24:12.879 --> 24:13.921
Oh, thank Christ!

24:14.041 --> 24:15.640
I tried to ring you.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.880
I know. Er... when...

24:17.041 --> 24:20.720
When are you coming home, Grace?
Because I really need you, OK?

24:20.840 --> 24:23.400
Rich, I haven't got long.
They're moving me again.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.800
Dad won't tell me where.

24:24.961 --> 24:27.480
Your fucking dad
wants to split us up.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.680
Run away.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.200
It's not that simple.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.561
It is! Just run away and I'll...

24:31.681 --> 24:33.520
He's my dad, Rich.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.160
Meet you in Paris, OK?

24:35.320 --> 24:37.360
I can't. Shit, it's him.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.439
No, wait, Grace!

24:39.841 --> 24:41.960
Oh, fuck me. Fuck! Fucking hell.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.640
Ah! Ah! Fucking hell, yeah!

24:44.760 --> 24:47.240
Ah! Ah!

24:47.400 --> 24:50.120
Ah, fuck! Fuck! Ah!

25:33.333 --> 25:34.352
{pub}No!

25:47.200 --> 25:49.680
See the acoustics in here, man?!

25:50.440 --> 25:51.800
Oi!

25:51.960 --> 25:53.320
Get this out!

25:53.480 --> 25:55.080
Why? This could be
the gig of the century!

25:57.000 --> 25:58.080
Rich...

25:58.240 --> 26:00.240
Richard, you give me back
my amp! Rich!

26:02.520 --> 26:05.400
That's nice. That's really
fucking nice, isn't it?

26:06.520 --> 26:09.800
Touch my kit, Rich, and you'll get
this one down your throat

26:09.960 --> 26:11.745
and this one up your arse.

26:11.865 --> 26:13.999
Everything I do for you
and you fuck it back at me.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.001
I fetched your gear for you.

26:15.121 --> 26:17.200
I don't want you to fetch my gear!

26:17.440 --> 26:18.681
I want you to fetch my girlfriend!

26:18.801 --> 26:20.360
Don't you get it, man?

26:20.520 --> 26:22.479
If she wanted to be here,
she would be here!

26:22.599 --> 26:23.840
No! She's dumped you, mate!

26:24.001 --> 26:27.240
All right, actually, no...
she got her dad to do it for her.

26:27.400 --> 26:31.240
Maybe that is a bit pussy, but now
we're going to party like it's 1999

26:31.400 --> 26:33.880
and get the fuck over it!

26:35.040 --> 26:36.640
Rich...
You fuck off!

26:36.800 --> 26:40.080
No, you dildo. Get off!
Rich, fuck off!

26:43.800 --> 26:44.720
What are you doing?

26:44.880 --> 26:46.520
You two look so fucking lame,

26:46.640 --> 26:48.080
I'm giving it
a sheen of responsibility.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.200
Well, don't, all right?

26:49.640 --> 26:50.641
Rich, get off!

26:50.761 --> 26:53.280
You think being in this stupid band
is going to help?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.080
Music doesn't solve anything!

26:55.200 --> 26:56.160
Yes, it does.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.119
That's what you've told me
all my life.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.601
This is the music revolution.

26:59.721 --> 27:01.560
Music revolution!

27:03.520 --> 27:06.200
You are first against the wall,
O'Malley!

27:10.760 --> 27:12.560
I was trying to help you.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.439
I am always trying to help you.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.201
Why bother?

27:15.321 --> 27:16.680
Because I'm your mate.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.960
Yeah? You sure you don't want
to be in the band

27:19.080 --> 27:20.160
so Mini can let you look her
in the eye when you suck her cock?

27:20.320 --> 27:22.240
Can you just keep it down, yeah?

27:22.360 --> 27:22.960
She still here?

27:23.120 --> 27:25.481
Yeah. She doesn't
want anyone to know.

27:25.601 --> 27:28.720
Do you want to know why Mini
doesn't want anyone to know?

27:28.840 --> 27:31.480
It's cos she'll fuck anything
and you're anything.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.200
You're a fucking joke.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.240
Mate...

27:39.800 --> 27:42.520
Oh, fuck!

27:42.680 --> 27:44.280
Oh, mother fucker!

27:46.200 --> 27:47.480
You know what?

27:47.600 --> 27:49.080
You give up poking Yoko Ono

27:49.200 --> 27:51.960
and we'll start the music
revolution together.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.000
Me and you.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.160
Don't ask me to do that, man.

27:56.280 --> 27:59.320
I might never see breasts
like that again.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.199
I mean, they are magnificent.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.361
Rich!

28:03.481 --> 28:04.880
Not the axe, Rich.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.200
Rich, don't throw away the dream!

28:08.480 --> 28:09.840
You dick.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.800
Take your piece of shit axe,
your piece of shit amp

28:13.920 --> 28:16.680
and put it in your piece of shit van
and fuck off!

28:44.280 --> 28:46.320
Let me get this straight...

28:46.440 --> 28:49.040
you broke in to your college
principal's house,

28:49.160 --> 28:51.439
started living there
and wearing his clothes?

28:51.559 --> 28:52.561
Alo started it.

28:52.681 --> 28:54.043
Jesus Christ!

28:54.163 --> 28:55.721
Why haven't you rung me?

28:55.841 --> 28:56.760
Huh?

28:56.920 --> 28:59.081
I've been going off my nut
cos my best friend's

28:59.201 --> 29:02.280
been in a coma for four weeks and
nobody could be arsed to ring me,

29:02.440 --> 29:03.641
tell me she woke up
and left the fucking country.

29:03.761 --> 29:05.800
I thought Mini would have told you.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.320
Mini knows about this?! What the
fuck... she can't pick up the phone?

29:09.480 --> 29:11.160
Maybe her mouth's too full.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.160
What?!

29:12.320 --> 29:13.960
Nothing.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.040
Everything's mental
since fucking Morocco.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.000
Can't we take her dad
to court or something?

29:21.120 --> 29:22.600
I don't think it works like that.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.999
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29:26.119 --> 29:27.240
I thought you were metal.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.080
Yeah, I thought I was, too.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.240
You're not the only one
who misses her, you know?

29:35.360 --> 29:37.360
What the fuck has happened to us all?

29:39.040 --> 29:40.600
Where are my friends?

29:47.400 --> 29:48.920
I-I'll get you some biscuits.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.600
Oi, mate, can we get some
biscuits here, please?

29:58.520 --> 30:01.120
I do actually feel a little better.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.760
You said you'd meet her
in Paris, right?

30:14.880 --> 30:16.719
I didn't get round to where to meet.

30:16.839 --> 30:17.959
Her dad came in.

30:18.079 --> 30:19.560
Ring the stupid clinic again.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.600
They won't talk to us.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.600
How hard can it be
to find someone in Paris?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.400
In the whole of Paris?

30:28.520 --> 30:29.480
Pretty hard.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.920
Not sounding very metal again, Rich.

30:33.040 --> 30:33.880
Liv.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.120
Here she comes.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.720
Hi.

30:37.840 --> 30:40.880
So, what's so important
you couldn't tell me on the phone?

30:43.480 --> 30:44.360
Grace woke up.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.400
Oh!

30:47.520 --> 30:49.160
Fuck, um...

30:49.280 --> 30:51.080
Can we go see her?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.521
How's your French?

31:00.720 --> 31:03.160
Oh, mate, I'm going as fast as I can.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.440
It's all right.
You don't have to leave.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.280
No, I think we really should leave.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.640
Why?

31:08.760 --> 31:10.920
According to Facebook,
there's about 300 people

31:11.080 --> 31:12.120
coming here to watch us play tonight.

31:12.281 --> 31:13.680
Cancel it.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.760
See, the thing is, I might have
said that there's an empty house

31:16.880 --> 31:19.160
in the middle of the countryside
and the owners are away,

31:19.321 --> 31:21.880
so they're really gonna
come and fuck this place up.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.120
Good. I hope they burn it down.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.360
Right, cock boy, I'm leaving...

31:26.520 --> 31:28.720
Oh...

31:28.840 --> 31:30.200
Hi.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.240
What are you doing here?

31:34.400 --> 31:37.960
You found them, then?
Your... straighteners?

31:38.120 --> 31:42.840
Yeah, yeah, I'm really gonna...
straighten my hair tonight.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.280
Mini, why didn't you tell us
Grace was OK?

31:48.080 --> 31:52.560
The signal's shit here...
I just found out!

31:52.720 --> 31:53.880
Yay!

31:55.840 --> 31:58.360
Well that's... that's my ride.

32:05.160 --> 32:05.960
So what's the happy haps?
You guys just chillin'?

32:06.120 --> 32:08.280
Shut up and drive me home,

32:08.560 --> 32:09.761
Wrist Monkey.

32:09.881 --> 32:12.000
Gonna get my dick sucked tonight.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.880
Up top, Creevey!

32:16.920 --> 32:18.080
Stay fresh, yeah?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.040
You're not going anywhere, Mins.

32:20.201 --> 32:24.160
We need to take a fiver off
every idiot that comes here tonight,

32:24.320 --> 32:26.040
then we fill up this dump truck with

32:26.281 --> 32:28.160
Diesel and we go get our friend back
OK?

32:58.120 --> 32:59.800
What?

32:59.920 --> 33:02.040
Nothing.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.800
Come on, mate. It's Revolution Time.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.079
Anybody fucks up,

33:14.240 --> 33:15.999
I'll chew their balls off.

33:16.119 --> 33:16.721
Mate, we need to, er...

33:16.841 --> 33:18.120
Get a new drummer. Yeah!

33:33.160 --> 33:35.360
Good evening,
children of the Revolution!

33:53.520 --> 33:55.880
* You are the sword I'm the Knight

33:56.160 --> 33:59.840
* It's destiny United we will fight

34:00.000 --> 34:03.040
* Chop us down we're reborn

34:03.200 --> 34:07.000
* Together forge a will
That can never be torn

34:07.120 --> 34:10.199
* You can cleft us in twain

34:10.360 --> 34:13.920
* But we'll reanimate
and our core remains the same

34:20.560 --> 34:24.040
* Because we are, we are, we are

34:24.199 --> 34:28.520
* Because we are
We are, we are one... *

34:35.880 --> 34:39.440
This house... this fucking house...
belongs to someone who doesn't care

34:39.560 --> 34:42.199
as long as you're in your place.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.159
This house is a fucking prison!
It needs... It needs to be...

34:46.280 --> 34:47.920
Ripped the fuck apart!

35:02.200 --> 35:05.040
* Seek to control

35:05.280 --> 35:08.040
* But you can't break our whole

35:09.480 --> 35:15.400
* We will be heard, be heard

35:17.120 --> 35:21.400
* Because we are, we are, we are

35:21.560 --> 35:24.120
* Because we are
We are, we are one. *

35:39.880 --> 35:40.760
Grace!

35:42.800 --> 35:44.480
Grace!

35:55.280 --> 35:56.320
Grace!

35:56.480 --> 35:57.840
Grace!

35:57.960 --> 36:00.200
Grace!

36:16.240 --> 36:17.720
Grace!

36:19.320 --> 36:20.720
What?

36:24.280 --> 36:25.800
Rich, just wait a second.

36:25.920 --> 36:26.599
I can't. I'm wasting time.

36:26.719 --> 36:28.999
You just made a mistake,
it's all right.

36:29.160 --> 36:29.959
She's got to be here!

36:30.079 --> 36:32.160
Rich, she's not here.
You're seeing things!

36:32.481 --> 36:35.200
Nothing works without her, Alo,
none of this!

36:35.360 --> 36:37.640
We're gonna find her, mate.
First thing tomorrow.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.680
No, not tomorrow! I need her now!

36:40.920 --> 36:41.960
It fucking hurts!

36:42.120 --> 36:45.992
It fucking hurts so much.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.240
Graaace!

37:01.720 --> 37:03.200
Wanker!

37:03.320 --> 37:04.560
Fuck you!

37:07.760 --> 37:08.920
Grace?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.160
Hello?

37:13.320 --> 37:14.720
Grace?!

37:24.720 --> 37:25.840
Hey...

37:30.320 --> 37:31.960
Hey.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.040
I came to find you.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.320
Yeah? After you trashed my house.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.520
Sorry about that.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.641
It got out of hand.

37:39.761 --> 37:41.920
Everything does, sooner or later.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.480
Yeah. Where is he? Your dad?

37:45.600 --> 37:48.920
I left him behind.
He can't get past things.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.400
Like?

37:52.240 --> 37:54.760
Like I... probably love you.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.640
Rich...
You've still got your clothes on.

38:05.960 --> 38:06.920
Oh... we can...

38:07.080 --> 38:08.520
we can do that now?

38:08.640 --> 38:10.160
We certainly can.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.880
Everything's better.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.520
Here you are again.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.960
Here I am again.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.280
I love you... so much.

40:14.394 --> 40:15.394
{pub}Grace?

41:00.080 --> 41:02.560
Hello.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.120
I had to go.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.840
Yeah. Why?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.360
You know why, Rich.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.400
No.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.520
Come back.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.640
I can't.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.560
Isn't everything beautiful
this morning?

41:22.720 --> 41:25.480
Everything is so beautiful.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.880
I don't understand.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.241
I love you, Rich.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.480
You fucked my house up, I see.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.360
Sorry.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.400
Where's Grace gone?

42:31.240 --> 42:32.480
I'm very sad to say...

42:37.040 --> 42:39.520
Actually,
she died yesterday afternoon.

42:46.760 --> 42:47.921
I just spoke to her.

42:48.041 --> 42:49.480
I speak to her all the time.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.120
Me too.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.120
What else is there to do?

42:59.840 --> 43:04.040
She never woke up, did she,
from the accident?

43:08.520 --> 43:10.760
That's why we went to Switzerland.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.560
To see if they could wake her up.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.480
I just wanted to try it, you know?

43:21.040 --> 43:22.720
So all this time, she was...?

43:24.360 --> 43:26.960
They said there was nobody
left inside.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.800
I thought, what would she think of me

43:31.920 --> 43:35.160
for turning off the stupid
machine thing?

43:37.320 --> 43:38.870
What would she think?

43:43.960 --> 43:45.759
She'd have thought you're her dad,

43:45.879 --> 43:47.840
and that's what
you're supposed to do.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.400
She loved me.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.520
And I...

44:13.200 --> 44:16.240
Yes.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.240
That's why I'm here.

44:56.240 --> 45:00.080
Talk to me. I don't want to.
Or even if I did... I can't.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.560
What the fuck is wrong with all
of you? What the fuck?!

45:05.400 --> 45:06.720
I think I can help.

45:06.880 --> 45:08.840
With what? With everything.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.840
Everything about me is magic.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.120
I don't need any new friends.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.920
Stop it. Stop fucking with my head.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.321
We don't know you.
We don't need you.

45:19.441 --> 45:22.440
Don't ever come back.
