Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:04.100 --> 00:07.000
- I'm learning more every day.
- With your journey.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.200
That's right. That's right. And I'm not
too proud to say I needed to make it.

00:12.100 --> 00:14.000
You noticed I haven't
mentioned the whore.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.700
- Something about you different.
- How's it going, Harold?

00:17.700 --> 00:21.100
- Where the cigarettes? All the time you smokin'.
- I quit.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.800
- Be careful. You get fat like Goodyear blimp.
- It's nice to see you too, pal.

00:24.600 --> 00:29.400
I talked to Greg, and he relayed your
message to me. You're gay now, huh?

00:29.300 --> 00:32.299
I just always liked you
as a friend, James.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.800
- Morning.
- Morning, Donna.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.600
Extra pencils. Actually...

00:59.600 --> 01:02.600
I'm gonna bunk here for a while.
Me and Marie...

01:02.600 --> 01:05.099
I- I was gonna say spat-
what we had.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.700
Actually, it was more
of a full-blown quarrel.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.700
Greg, I-I'm sorry you have problems
at home. But we discussed...

01:11.600 --> 01:14.600
- I'm not comfortable with the subject.
- Absolutely understood.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.100
I have a suitcase on my person.
I was explaining what it was.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.900
- Good morning, Detective.
- Good morning, Donna. Greg.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.400
Hey, Bobby.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Oh, hey, Andy. I'm sorry
to hold you up on that D.D.5.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.200
I was startin'it last night
when World War lll broke out.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.400
- Fancy's looking for it.
- I know.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.100
I'll finish it right away.
Me and Marie went at it pretty good.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.100
I'm gonna bivouac
in a crib upstairs.

01:38.900 --> 01:41.100
Might be moving in with him.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.300
- Why's that?
- Sylvia's got this test.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.000
- You know, they take out some fluid?
- Amniocentesis?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.900
Uh, I guess it's
pretty standard nowadays.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.900
Yeah. It's very run of the mill.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.300
So she asked me this morning.
She said, Do you want to go?"

01:53.300 --> 01:55.800
Dope that I am,
I figure I got a choice.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.900
Homicide in Chinatown.
Greg, I need that D.D.5.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.100
- Yeah. Right away, Lieu.
- Okay.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.400
- So you said no?
- Yeah.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.800
Now she looks at me like one of them snails,
leaves a trail on the cement?

02:06.800 --> 02:10.000
So I'm following her around
the apartment, you know? 'Please, let me go.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.600
Let me see some huge needle get stuck
in your belly so I nearly pass out."

02:14.500 --> 02:17.000
Uh-uh," she says.
Not if you have to be begged."

02:16.900 --> 02:19.200
- Go with her, Andy.
- Yeah. Now she says I can't.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.600
- She don't mean that.
- Ah, it's like talking to a skell.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.000
You never know where you stand. I gotta
tell Medavoy I got dibs on the upper bunk.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.300
Thanks.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.500
Hey, Doc.
Pretty good service there.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.900
Yeah. Well, I was on
a coronary two blocks away.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.600
German tourist facedown in his wonton soup.
Now I got a jumper in Gramercy Park.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.300
And somehow, I'm supposed to make
a 10:15 squash game on the island.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.900
Whew! That kind of stress, they wonder
why you guys burn out.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.200
- So what do we got here?
- Nineteen-year-old Asian girl.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.900
Homicide stabbing.
Two wounds in the chest...

04:02.800 --> 04:05.600
one right through the heart-
time of death, sometime after midnight.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.500
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah, see you guys.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.300
- How's it going?
- Victim's name is Katie Chow.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.200
Lives here with her parents.
Works at their shop around the corner.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.600
T- shirts, baseball caps,
tourist stuff.

04:18.600 --> 04:22.000
- Any weapon?
- No. We haven't found one so far.

04:21.899 --> 04:24.300
E.S.U. 's comin'down.
Gonna do a search.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.000
- Any sign of forced entry here?
- No. Not at all.

04:29.800 --> 04:34.600
Andy, what do you think these are?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.400
M.E. Said they're cat scratches.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.300
The parents in there?

04:39.300 --> 04:41.900
They got a nephew with them.
Speaks English pretty good.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.600
All right, thanks.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.600
Hey, kitty.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.700
- Are you the nephew?
- Yes. I'm Lyle Chow.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.700
Detective Sipowicz. I'm Detective Simone.
They don't speak any English, huh?

05:01.700 --> 05:03.700
Not much. I can translate.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.000
Mr. And Mrs. Chow,
we're very sorry for your loss.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.900
When was the last time
they saw their daughter alive?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.800
I went to the bedroom
about 11:00, and Katie was...

05:30.800 --> 05:33.500
in the living room talking with Eddie Wong"-
That's her boyfriend.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.600
- What did she say?
- She said she never liked him.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.700
Do they think that Eddie might have
had something to do with her death?

05:49.400 --> 05:52.000
They don't know.
They think he's no good.

05:51.900 --> 05:55.200
- Too flashy.
- Well, this Eddie, do they know...

05:55.200 --> 05:57.900
where he lives or how we can
get in touch with him?

06:00.300 --> 06:04.100
Do you mind if we look around?

06:05.900 --> 06:09.100
If they could put a list
together of Katie's friends...

06:09.100 --> 06:11.800
coworkers and so forth,
that'd be a big help.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.300
- Hey.
- What do you got?

06:52.100 --> 06:54.700
- Is that Eddie?
- Yeah.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.900
This book is in Chinese.
It could be of help.

06:56.900 --> 07:00.200
We're gonna take it with us. Thanks.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.700
How come all these guys want
to look like Steven Seagal?

07:11.100 --> 07:13.500
Yeah, come on through.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.700
- Hey, James.
- Hey.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.400
That couple going into the coffee room,
and this is the 61.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.300
You want to work it
with Adrianne?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.300
Yeah, all right.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.900
Adrianne, uh, Lieu wants you to help me
with this house robbery.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.700
Sure.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.700
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.200
- Hi. I'm Detective Martinez.
- Hello.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.700
- Detective Lesniak.
- Hi.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.400
- Hereafter we can meet you downstairs, all right?
- That's no problem.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.600
Were the both of you home
when the robbery occurred?

07:49.600 --> 07:54.000
- I was at my chess club meeting.
- I was reading.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.300
And I heard
a knock at the door.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.200
No one had buzzed,
so I was a little concerned.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.100
I looked through the peephole...

08:00.100 --> 08:03.500
George had a second one installed,
so I could see from my chair.

08:03.500 --> 08:07.500
And I saw a man
holding a policeman's badge.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.700
I asked who it was,
and he said...

08:09.700 --> 08:14.500
Police. I just need to ask a few questions,"
or something like that.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.900
As soon as the chain was off the door,
a black man burst in and said...

08:17.900 --> 08:20.000
Tell me where the cash is
and you won't get hurt."

08:19.900 --> 08:22.600
I was so scared.
I couldn't even talk.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.700
And that's when he hit me.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.799
Take your time,
Mrs. Donaldson. No rush.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.400
If you don't want to go through
with this, honey, that's okay too.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.700
- Everything we lost can be replaced.
- No, I'm okay.

08:38.700 --> 08:43.200
You say you're okay. But meanwhile
you're distraught, and you're going to pieces.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.300
I don't know if we need
any more complications like this.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.200
I can do this.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.300
All right. Fine.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.700
How would you describe the man
in terms ofheight, build, clothing?

09:10.700 --> 09:13.900
- Hey, Andy.
- Harold.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.700
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.800
- You know Bobby Simone?
- Hey, Bobby. You left the P.C. Office, huh?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.100
- Yeah, yeah.
- Good.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.400
So, Andy, how's married life
treating you, huh?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
Not bad. I'm having a baby.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.700
Oh, congratulations. Hope
the little baby look like wife, huh?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.300
- Yeah, you and me both.
- So what we got?

09:29.300 --> 09:31.700
Got a 19-year-old girl
stabbed to death in Chinatown.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.200
No record. Never been in
any kind of trouble before.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.800
Last seen with her boyfriend, who her
parents don't like. Name is Eddie Wong.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.200
Why they hell boss
send me to Brooklyn?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.500
Oh, the victim's
two friends live over here.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.700
Found this in her, uh-
Found this in her room.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.600
- We think it looks like Chinese.
- Yeah.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
- I'll take a look.
- Andy, I think that's her over there.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.800
Listen, uh, if she speaks
English, let me talk to her...

09:53.800 --> 09:55.800
and you guys could
talk to the other one.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.400
- Over by Sunset Park.
- I drive. This guy maniac behind wheel.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.600
See you back at the house.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.300
- Are you Stacey Foo? -
Yeah. - Hi, how are you doing?

10:08.200 --> 10:11.400
- I'm Detective Simone.
- Katie's dad called. He said you'd be coming.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.200
Can you, uh, think of anyone
who might've wanted to hurt Katie?

10:14.100 --> 10:16.000
No. No way.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.100
- You know this guy Eddie Wong?
- Yeah. He used to be her boyfriend.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.800
- Used to be?
- He dumped her the day before it happened.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.200
- So was Katie upset over that?
- My God, she was, like, devastated.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.600
She thought they were gonna get married.
Eddie might've said that...

10:27.500 --> 10:30.100
so she would sleep with him,
or maybe she just assumed.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.100
- But she did think it.
- So what did you think of Eddie?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.300
Cute.

10:35.300 --> 10:38.100
Do you think he might've been
involved in her death in any way?

10:38.000 --> 10:42.400
No. Even though he's in a gang and everything,
he was always real nice when I saw him.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.100
- He's in a gang? What's the name of the gang?
- The Flying Dragons.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.600
How am I gonna get ahold of this guy, Eddie?
Do you know where he lives?

10:49.500 --> 10:52.900
But I know he drives a black Lexus.
The expensive one.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.300
Okay. Thanks, Stacey.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.500
If you think of anything else,
give me a call.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.800
As soon as we've got some books and mug
shots put together based on your description...

11:12.700 --> 11:15.200
- we'll bring them to your apartment.
- Thanks.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.900
- Help my wife down the stairs?
- No problem.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.700
- Honey, I'll be down in a minute.
- All right.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.600
Could we talk somewhere,
just the two of us?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.700
Yeah, sure.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.700
So, uh, what's on your mind,
Mr. Donaldson?

11:36.800 --> 11:38.900
I wasn't at the chess club last night.

11:38.900 --> 11:43.900
- Uh-huh.
- I love my wife as much as I ever did.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.900
But we don't have
a sexual relationship any longer.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.000
After the accident,
she stopped enjoying it.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.000
So where were you
last night, Mr. Donaldson?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.900
I meet a woman
every week at a hotel.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.900
Why did you feel
you needed to tell me this?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.100
There's a small chance
she could be involved.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.600
- What are you basing that on?
- No concrete reason. Just an impression I have.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.400
- The type of person that she is?
- She's a prostitute.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.800
She's not the most reputable type,
I wouldn't think.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.900
- And she knows something about your home?
- I've told her some things.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
- Including your wife's a cripple?
- You can't tell my wife.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.900
- I would never hurt her, Detective.
- What's this woman's name?

12:13.900 --> 12:17.200
Ellen Lewis.
I don't know if that's real.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.500
- Where are we gonna find her?
- You can't tell Mary.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.800
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell your wife.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.000
I've got her phone number.
I'll give it to you.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.700
We'll set it up.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.700
Mine doesn't think
Eddie's involved.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.700
- She say he was in the Flying Dragons?
- Yeah.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.700
But nobody cares,
'cause he was so cute.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.900
You know, that was them last year,
that shooting in the bowling alley.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.700
Where they had 30 witnesses
and nobody saw nothing?

12:50.700 --> 12:53.700
- Be nice if we can get Eddie to double up.
- Keep dreaming.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.700
Next to these guys,
the goombahs are loudmouths.

12:55.700 --> 13:00.800
- Eddie Wong's address in diary. Scumbag block.
- Let's go.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.900
- Andy. I finished that five.
- Come on. We're gonna hit an apartment.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.200
Harold says there's a fire escape
in the alley.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.000
- We'll go around back.
- We got the front entrance.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.900
Yeah.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.800
- You want some fish?
- No.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.200
- Harold.
- Yeah.

13:50.800 --> 13:55.100
Exterminator.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.800
Police!

14:00.800 --> 14:04.200
- Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.300
Show him how to get down.
Freeze! Back from the window!

14:06.300 --> 14:11.000
You tell him his ass is mine!

14:10.800 --> 14:13.300
You okay?

14:13.300 --> 14:16.000
- Yeah.
- This guy speaks English. I got the back.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.800
Hey! Head up!
Head up! Head up!

14:18.700 --> 14:20.800
Tell them to get their heads up.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.400
- He's not here.
- I massage girl! No friend.

14:25.300 --> 14:29.200
- Miss, you keep your mouth shut. Andy, you all right back there?
- All clear!

14:29.200 --> 14:33.700
Got a Tech-9, a Glock
and a nine millimeter automatic.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.400
And a half key of heroin
and a.38. Greg.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.500
Call the radio cars for transportation.
Let them know we got six to the house.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.900
15th Squad to Central K."
Got six coming into the house.

14:42.900 --> 14:46.800
- Need transport.
- Miss, hey. Get up. Get dressed. Dressed!

14:46.800 --> 14:49.300
Harold?

14:49.300 --> 14:51.500
- Yeah?
- I want you to tell them...

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
that they just finished
taking shots at cops.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.000
If they had any brains, they'd cooperate.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.900
You tell them they got until
we get back to the house...

14:57.900 --> 15:00.000
to try and smarten up
and help themselves out.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.800
I dare any woman...

15:13.800 --> 15:16.500
Could I say something?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.600
I want to challenge anyone
in this audience with my ability.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.100
- Code word is bingo?"
- Yeah.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.300
- Who is it?
- It's Ellen.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.000
- Hi.
- Hi. You must be Ray.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah. Come on in.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.400
- Nice room.
- Yeah.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.400
Uh, I'm a little new at this, Ellen.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.100
I guess we should talk about,
you know, what we're gonna do...

15:51.100 --> 15:53.600
- and get the business part out of the way.
- Mm.

15:53.500 --> 15:57.400
Why don't you take your clothes off,
so I know you're not a cop...

15:57.300 --> 16:01.100
and you'll be comfortable,
and then we'll talk all about it.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.800
See, I'm-I'm
getting comfortable.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.300
Yeah. So far, so good.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.300
I, uh, think I should
know what I'm getting.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.300
Yeah. Look, honey...

16:13.300 --> 16:15.900
why don't you take your clothes off
so I know you're not a cop?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.800
And then we'll have
a real nice party.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.200
A cop? Listen, George just said
you were a nice, talented girl.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You know, a-You know,
a good friend of his.

16:24.100 --> 16:28.900
- If this is gonna get complicated, I don't-
- Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.200
- How about a half-and-half for 200?
- Yeah?

16:32.100 --> 16:34.000
- Mm.
- Bingo.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.400
Zip up, Ellen. You're busted.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.900
- I knew you were a cop.
- But you couldn't resist, right?

16:46.500 --> 16:49.400
That heroin we found
in your apartment...

16:49.300 --> 16:51.900
that kind of weight, gotta
take that to Federal court.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.900
Mandatory minimum sentence
you're looking at is 10 years.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.600
- It's not my apartment.
- That's right. You werejust visiting.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.000
As soon as you realized it was
full of guns, whores and drugs...

16:59.900 --> 17:02.000
you were so shocked
you dove out the window.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.500
See, we're giving you a choice here,
Jimmy. You do the 10 years...

17:04.500 --> 17:06.500
or you help us on these
homicides we're looking at.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.900
I don't know anything about
the bowling alley, or the girl.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.700
- And I don't know Eddie Wong.
- You tell us where to find this Eddie...

17:12.700 --> 17:14.900
and at the very least,
we get this put in state court.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.400
You probably get 10 months
or maybe get a walk.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.099
This is no testimony, Jimmy.
This is an address.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.200
Nobody's gonna know
you did anything.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.599
Ten years or 10 months.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.100
A guy named Eddie. Might be him.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.300
Used to hang out at the apartment.

17:32.300 --> 17:35.100
- He run some games at a place on Mott Street.
- Gambling?

17:35.100 --> 17:38.400
Mah-jongg, craps.
It starts about 900.

17:38.400 --> 17:43.300
- What's he drive?
- Lexus. 400 coupe.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.500
I'm looking for Detective Medavoy.
I'm his wife.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.700
Ah, he stepped out.
He should be back any moment.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.600
I have to give him this.
I'll wait.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.200
Miss Donna Abandando.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.800
I don't need a nameplate
to know who you are.

18:23.700 --> 18:28.100
The one Greg was involved with. Bitch!

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
Uh, Mrs. Medavoy, I don't think
this the appropriate place.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.500
- Did you convince him to move out again?
- Uh...

18:37.600 --> 18:40.300
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Not from you.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.100
Come with me anyway.

18:56.300 --> 19:01.500
Mrs. Medavoy, whatever problems you and
Gregory are having have nothing to do with me.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.300
Gregory and I have
no personal relationship whatsoever.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.400
I'm supposed to believe that?
After you stole him once already?

19:07.300 --> 19:11.100
I'm supposed to believe someone who has
no regard for the sanctity of the family.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.900
Is that what you and your bag boy
from the grocery talked about?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.700
- The sanctity of the family?
- The assistant manager!

19:18.700 --> 19:20.800
- That was a completely different situation.
- Oh!

19:20.800 --> 19:25.000
I don't care to argue.
I'm sorry Gregory left.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.900
But I had nothing to do with that.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.800
Did you ever consider that an outsider
might not have caused this?

19:34.700 --> 19:37.600
That something might actually
be wrong with your marriage?

19:37.400 --> 19:40.000
Oh, yeah?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.400
Why don't you do a lovelorn column?
Advice from a Whore."

19:49.600 --> 19:53.400
Hey, Donna. Marie?

19:53.400 --> 19:56.800
You took the wrong suitcase.
You tookJanie's ice skating stuff.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.500
Um, sorry.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.300
Medavoy.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.200
L- I'll talk to you later.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.900
Bitch!

20:17.900 --> 20:20.100
So we got an address
on the gambling joint that Wong runs.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.900
- We're gonna hit it tonight.
- Wong's a Flying Dragon.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.600
- May know about those bowling alley homicides.
- He's got to.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.900
- You get a search warrant?
- Yeah. I'm gonna talk to Sylvia.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.800
She's in taking a statement.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.900
So you don't give much weight
to the girlfriends' statements?

20:31.900 --> 20:35.200
- Where they don't think he killed her?
- Still gotta look at the guy.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.500
- They hardly knew him.
- What about the others you picked up?

20:37.500 --> 20:39.700
The shooter's being booked
on attempted murder.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.800
The other three on the guns
and the narcotics. We let the girls go.

20:42.800 --> 20:47.200
Finish diary, Lieu. Our D.0.A. All kinda
upset with this guy named Eddie Wong.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.500
You know, about the breakup.
'Don't know if I can go on."

20:49.500 --> 20:51.400
Life not worth living."
The whole nine yard.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.900
- Think it could be a suicide?
- I don't know.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.800
- She sound pretty depressed.
- Okay.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.500
Let's get that warrant from Sylvia.

21:03.800 --> 21:08.200
- You with us, Greg?
- Yeah.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.700
Sylvia...

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
we're gonna need
a search warrant.

21:15.500 --> 21:21.100
That guy we like in the Chinatown homicide
here. Eddie Wong, 608 Mott Street.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.900
- Sure.
- So, 4:00, huh?

21:24.700 --> 21:27.100
- Sorry?
- Your doctor's appointment.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.100
Oh, yes. 4:00.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.600
Sylvia, let me go with you.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.800
Nah, Andy. Not with
your teeth clenched.

21:35.800 --> 21:40.000
My sole point- this is
a professional procedure.

21:39.800 --> 21:44.100
- We can certainly hope.
- The last thing the doctor needs...

21:43.900 --> 21:48.100
He sticks a needle in you,
I'm standing there observing.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.900
Besides which,
your privates are uncovered.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.900
We understand each other perfectly.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.200
Great tie.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.200
Oh, boy.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.200
- How do you wanna work the interview?
- I'll go off you.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.400
I'm gonna try and shake her up,
make this Donaldson woman in bad shape.

22:25.100 --> 22:29.800
- You been busted before. Right, Ellen?
- Just once, maybe twice.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.900
If you help us out, this don't
have to go on your record.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.300
- Help you out? How?
- How well do you know George Donaldson?

22:35.300 --> 22:38.000
- George Donaldson?
- We know he's one of your regular johns.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.500
I see him every once in a while.
I don't really know him.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.900
- You ever been in his apartment?
- No.

22:44.900 --> 22:49.000
You know George's wife was robbed a couple
of days ago when George was with you?

22:48.900 --> 22:50.800
- No.
- That's right. The guy who did it raped her.

22:50.800 --> 22:54.600
- And he also put a bad beatin'on her.
- She may not make it.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.000
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, Ellen?

22:57.800 --> 23:00.400
You know what we did while
you were sitting herejust now?

23:00.300 --> 23:04.400
We called your beeper company.
And we found out who the bill goes to.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.800
- Spenser McVeigh.
- Is he your pimp?

23:06.700 --> 23:09.300
- I don't have a pimp.
- Lots of times we see girls...

23:09.200 --> 23:11.500
who get information on their johns
and pass it along to their pimps.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.400
- You ever do that?
- No.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.000
I'm gonna say this once, Ellen.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.200
If we find out this Spenser did this,
and you was involved in the planning...

23:19.200 --> 23:21.300
or anything like that,
to tell him where to go...

23:21.300 --> 23:23.500
it's just like you were there.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.400
You don't know it was Spenser.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.700
The guy who raped and beat up
Mrs. Donaldson knew she was in a wheelchair.

23:28.600 --> 23:33.700
- How do you think he knew that?
- If she dies, this turns into second-degree murder.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
Eligible for the death penalty.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.500
I didn't do anything. And I haven't
seen George since last week.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.300
You think Spenser knows anything?

23:41.300 --> 23:44.000
We got people searching
his place right now. If we get a call...

23:43.900 --> 23:46.400
and they've found some of
the Donaldson's property over there...

23:46.400 --> 23:49.400
you could be facing the death penalty,
so think about that.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.100
Get in front of this now
and do yourself a favor.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.700
Maybe we can work something out.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.500
Is Spenser gonna protect you?

23:56.600 --> 23:59.800
Or is he gonna make things better
for himself, saying it was your idea?

24:04.800 --> 24:08.100
It wasn't my idea.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.300
15th Squad advising.
Units at the back. We're going in.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.200
- Police!
- Everybody freeze! Hands on the tables!

24:43.200 --> 24:45.800
- Against the wall!
- Get your hands on the tables!

24:45.700 --> 24:49.500
Get the hands where we can
see them! Don't worry about your money!

24:49.300 --> 24:51.700
Against the wall!
Up against the wall!

24:51.700 --> 24:54.400
Against the wall.
Against the wall.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.600
- Andy, you see him?
- Not yet.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.200
All right. We're looking
for Eddie Wong. Harold?

25:01.300 --> 25:04.800
- Eddie!
- Eddie Wong!

25:04.700 --> 25:07.900
- Eddie! Eddie Wong! -
You know Eddie Wong? - No.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.300
Eddie Wong?

25:10.300 --> 25:16.000
Got him!

25:15.900 --> 25:18.200
- What are you guys bothering me for?
- Shut up.

25:21.900 --> 25:24.400
Here.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.900
Everybody clear?
Right here. About here.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.200
If you could place her
in front of the window.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.200
You'll be looking
through a one-way glass.

25:47.100 --> 25:50.500
So you don't have to worry
about anyone seeing you.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.100
I'm just amazed you got
a suspect so quickly.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.500
- We acted on a tip. All set?
- Yeah.

26:02.100 --> 26:05.200
All right?

26:05.200 --> 26:08.300
You got her?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.600
Do you recognize
anyone in the room?

26:13.300 --> 26:15.300
Number three.

26:17.100 --> 26:20.100
- Where do you recognize him from?
- He's the man who robbed me.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Hold number three.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.800
Excuse me a second, will you?

26:37.400 --> 26:40.200
- Are you sure Ellen is involved?
- The guy is her pimp.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.300
She said she gave him the address,
told him you had cash in the house...

26:42.300 --> 26:44.300
and your wife was in the chair.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
And he was just I.D.'d.
I'd say she was involved.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.200
- It'd be great if you get him to plead guilty.
- Well, we'd like that too.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.200
If there's a trial, very painful information
will come out.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.800
- I'd hate to hurt my wife like that.
- We'll see what his lawyer says.

26:53.700 --> 26:56.400
Even if it means less jail time,
I'd be comfortable with that.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.000
You're doing a lot of dealing,
considering you're not the one...

26:59.000 --> 27:01.600
that had a gun barrel
pointed at your face.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.600
- I'm doing it for her sake.
- It's good she's got you looking out for her.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.400
- You guys are jamming me up.
- All right.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.400
- I'll take a sleeping pill so I don't lie awake.
- Your girlfriend died, Eddie.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.700
- You know, she was stabbed to death.
- It's got nothing to do with me.

27:21.700 --> 27:25.500
- Sit down!
- Nothing to do with me.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.300
Yeah. Well, we were
over at her parents'house.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.100
- That's not what they think.
- They think you did it, Eddie.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.900
Her parents hate me.
They think I'm a gangster.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.100
- Where would they get that impression?
- So what happened to her?

27:36.100 --> 27:40.200
- I don't know.
- You were the last one seen with her. You were arguing.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.400
You're in a gang.
You got a criminal record.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.700
- I would never hurt Katie.
- Well, Katie wound up dead.

27:45.600 --> 27:51.200
If you're so upset, why aren't you looking for
who killed her? Who's your hero, Eddie? O. J?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.900
You want to know what I think?
I think she killed herself.

27:53.900 --> 27:57.600
- And why would she do that?
- I know she was pretty upset when I left.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.900
I told her I couldn't see her anymore.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.400
- You got a pretty high opinion of yourself.
- Hey, listen.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.400
It didn't make any sense to me either.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.200
I mean, she worked her 12 hours,
came home, dinner, television, that was it.

28:07.200 --> 28:10.400
Me? Every night's like Saturday night.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.400
So I told her it wasn't gonna work.
And she said she couldn't live without me.

28:13.300 --> 28:18.300
You know, how all girls do.
But I swear, I didn't think she was serious.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.400
So you figured she killed herself
and the knife escaped?

28:20.400 --> 28:23.400
If we check your place, are we gonna
find any knives over there, Eddie?

28:23.300 --> 28:25.300
Having a knife doesn't mean I killed her.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.000
I swear, I had nothing to do with this.
You gotta let me go.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.500
No, no, no. No good, Eddie. You see, we got
enough to charge you for murder right now.

28:35.100 --> 28:40.500
- You guys are gonna get me killed.
- By who?

28:40.400 --> 28:42.500
Whoever kills me,
you ain't gonna solve it.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.900
- Why is that, Eddie?
- I didn't kill this girl, all right?

28:45.900 --> 28:48.200
I didn't kill anyone.
But I'm gonna wind up dead.

28:48.200 --> 28:51.300
Over what?

28:51.200 --> 28:53.500
Right now,
they're going over my place.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.800
- Who is?
- The guys I work for!

28:56.700 --> 29:00.900
Who am I kidding?

29:00.800 --> 29:04.600
I'm dead right now.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.400
My second guy ran off
with the books.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.700
You been skimming a little?
The boys gonna find out?

29:10.700 --> 29:14.000
You got something else for us
there, Eddie? Huh?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.300
Because I am telling you,
we will hang you for this Katie.

29:17.100 --> 29:20.700
I didn't touch her.
And I can't give up these guys!

29:20.600 --> 29:24.200
Why, Eddie?
Because it's not honorable?

29:24.100 --> 29:26.300
Well, you think
about the honor in this.

29:26.300 --> 29:30.900
You think about being in Rikers
and having several large convicts...

29:30.700 --> 29:33.800
honor you by turning
your ass into chop suey.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.300
Understand this, Eddie. We have enough to
charge you right now. Her parents say it was you.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.900
On the other hand,
if you got something heavy enough...

29:38.900 --> 29:40.800
you could be looking
at witness protection.

29:40.900 --> 29:42.900
See, you got a good look
to you, Eddie.

29:42.800 --> 29:47.000
Good personality, obviously very
high impact with the ladies there.

29:46.900 --> 29:51.900
Every night's a Saturday night. There is no reason
you can't start again somewheres else.

29:51.700 --> 29:56.800
There were some homicides last year, Eddie.
Flying Dragon was involved.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.000
I can't testify. If I testify
against a Flying Dragon, I'm dead.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.300
You could testify and be long gone, assuming
that your story on the girl holds up.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.000
I got nothing to do with her.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.300
If that's true, Eddie, and
we make some cases off of you...

30:08.400 --> 30:11.900
there's no reason why
next year you can't be...

30:11.700 --> 30:15.200
in a basement somewheres else taking
your neighbor's hard-earned money.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.400
The shooter from the bowling alley
moved toJersey.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.500
Name's David Chin.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.400
Write it.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.800
So, uh, you think this'll be
a temporary thing, Greg?

30:41.800 --> 30:45.600
I don't know, James,
I don't even know what I hope.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.800
I figured you guys
were gettin' it together.

30:47.800 --> 30:53.100
Yeah, well, a period after we moved back in,
things were going good.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.400
Then eventually,
we're bickering again.

30:56.400 --> 31:01.000
We're back in a groove, like
salmon going back to spawn.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.000
Only we don't spawn, of course.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.800
Yeah. Sometimes I think that
the monks got the right idea.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.300
Yeah.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.900
You and Adrianne working
that house robbery together?

31:10.900 --> 31:13.200
- Yeah.
- How are you gettin' along?

31:13.200 --> 31:17.900
All right. You know. I still gotta
call her out on that lesbian thing.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.800
Her exact position there.
Except I never find the right spot.

31:21.800 --> 31:25.500
Just ask her man to man.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.500
Things with this Anita were
going pretty good, you know.

31:27.600 --> 31:32.000
- Oh, your dietitian friend.
- Yeah. I halfway figure, why rock the boat?

31:31.800 --> 31:36.700
But I still felt like I could really develop
something strong with Adrianne.

31:38.400 --> 31:41.800
You ever imagine having
feelings like that for someone?

31:41.700 --> 31:44.500
Yeah.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.200
Hey, Greg. I hope you don't think
I'm out of line, but...

31:47.200 --> 31:48.900
In what regards?

31:48.900 --> 31:52.400
I was wondering, you know,
what was it like, bein' with Donna?

31:55.400 --> 31:57.800
Imagine the best experience
you've ever had.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.600
Yeah?

32:01.600 --> 32:04.600
Now double it.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.600
Ouch.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.300
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

32:38.300 --> 32:41.000
Not too much... discomfort?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.400
Mm-mm.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.800
When do they expect
to know something?

32:48.800 --> 32:52.300
In about 10 days.
They said that I seem fine.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.900
He has next to no index of concern."

32:59.000 --> 33:01.600
Andy, we're having a boy.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.800
You're confident on that?

33:09.800 --> 33:13.100
When they do an amnio,
they also do an ultrasound.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.600
See? That's his head.
And that's his arm.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.900
And that's his penis.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.200
It's kind of fuzzy.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.500
Hey, how did they get
that picture?

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
Well, they put some
jelly on your stomach.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.500
And then they pass some sort
of transmitter over it.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.500
- Hmm.
- How did you think they took it?

33:54.000 --> 33:57.400
Oh, th-that'd be preferable.
That method.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.400
All this science,
it really keeps you on your toes.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.000
The D.A. Says if this Eddie Wong's cleared
on his girlfriend's death...

34:18.000 --> 34:21.100
he'll get relocation for testimony
in the bowling alley whack.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.800
The address that Wong gave on this guy
that did the homicide is out in East Orange.

34:24.800 --> 34:28.000
- So we're coordinating with theJersey state police.
- Wong ready to I.D. The guy?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.500
- Guys.
- That's the Chow girl's parents.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.800
We're gonna talk to 'em more
on the suicide angle.

34:32.699 --> 34:36.100
- I'll take 'em to coffee room, okay?
- Yeah.

34:35.900 --> 34:39.000
Lieu, the medical examiner said
those scratches on their daughter's thigh...

34:38.900 --> 34:40.699
he thought might
have come from a cat?

34:40.699 --> 34:42.699
Those might be hesitation marks.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.800
Someone trying to get
the nerve to stab themselves.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.800
He figured it out
during a squash game.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.000
If it was a suicide, where's the knife?

34:57.600 --> 34:59.900
- Hey.
- James.

35:03.300 --> 35:06.000
These are three more items
we realized were taken.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.800
Our insurer says you have to list them
before they'll honor our claim.

35:09.700 --> 35:12.100
It's no problem. We can make out
a supplementary five.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.200
- How are you feeling today?
- I'm upset.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.100
Expect to feel that way a lot,
Mrs. Donaldson.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.100
It's natural, with what happened.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.700
- My wife thinks we should move.
- I don't feel safe anymore.

35:22.700 --> 35:26.000
I thought since we were coming up here,
you could explain to her that's not necessary.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.700
I don't feel safe.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.600
I think the detectives can explain
there's no reason not to feel safe.

35:31.500 --> 35:35.100
The man has agreed
to a plea and is in jail.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.300
He is in jail, Mr. Donaldson. But
your wife being frightened is still real.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.200
One way to think of it-
Imagine your feelings if, God forbid...

35:41.200 --> 35:43.400
- there was a murder in the apartment.
- That's right.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.600
That's absolutely right.
But there wasn't a murder.

35:45.600 --> 35:50.000
And the man who did this is in custody, and
rent-controlled apartments don't fall off trees!

35:51.300 --> 35:53.700
I don't know how many more
adjustments I got in me.

35:53.700 --> 35:56.200
And how many more sacrifices!

35:56.100 --> 35:59.700
If I'm going to have to live this way,
I wish I'd died.

35:59.700 --> 36:02.200
Detective Lesniak, can you fill out
this five for Mrs. Donaldson?

36:02.200 --> 36:05.100
- Sure, James.
- Mr. Donaldson, come here.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
You know, maybe your wife
would feel more secure...

36:15.200 --> 36:17.100
if she knew the neighborhood
wasn't going high crime...

36:17.200 --> 36:19.100
or that the break-in
came from your whore's pimp.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.800
- That's not an alternative.
- You don't choose to make...

36:21.800 --> 36:23.300
that information available,
and I'm not gonna sit in judgment.

36:23.200 --> 36:27.000
- You are judging me!
- I'm telling you. Don't make us your beards.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.700
If you're too cheap to lose your rent control
to buy your wife some peace of mind...

36:30.600 --> 36:32.800
or whatever mind games you want
to run because she let you down...

36:32.800 --> 36:35.600
and got crippled, that's your call.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.700
Don't do it in this house.
Don't use me and my partner.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.900
- You follow?
- Yes.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.800
Do what you want on the street. When
you're in this building, act like a man.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.400
Now, go back with your wife.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.700
This must be a graduation picture.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.700
Sun Yat-sen Middle School
Student of the Month."

37:10.100 --> 37:12.100
- Look, Harold.
- Yeah.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.100
We'd like you to ask
Mr. And Mrs. Chow...

37:14.100 --> 37:18.300
with regards to their daughter's
break-up with Eddie Wong...

37:18.200 --> 37:20.300
how upset was Katie about that?

37:28.200 --> 37:31.300
She won't tell them anything.
She know they disapprove.

37:31.300 --> 37:35.300
So that means she was upset?

37:38.900 --> 37:44.000
Now, Harold, I want you to tell Mr. Chow
that if this was not a murder...

37:43.800 --> 37:45.900
that we are spending a lot
of time and effort here...

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
when we could be out there
catching other criminals.

37:47.800 --> 37:52.900
Let him know that neither him or his wife
will be in trouble for not telling us before.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.200
Huh?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.500
Tell police not to look
for Eddie Wong no more.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.400
They try to be good parents.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.800
Of course you did. Yes.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.400
That's the knife their daughter used
for the suicide.

38:29.300 --> 38:32.100
Tell the police not to look
anymore for Eddie Wong.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.200
Hey. James, it's your case.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.300
You need to sign the supplemental five.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.900
- Yeah. Thanks for filling that out.
- You'll give it to the boss?

38:50.800 --> 38:55.000
- Yeah. Thanks, Adrianne.
- Some jerk, huh? That poor woman's husband?

38:54.900 --> 38:56.500
Yeah.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.300
I mean, I know it's gotta be
a tough adjustment for him too.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.200
No, he wasn't bein' straightforward.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.400
He was saying one thing
and meaning something else.

39:03.300 --> 39:07.300
Honey this, and that- and meanwhile
he was hurting her feelings.

39:07.300 --> 39:12.500
Yeah. Anyway,
I enjoyed working with you.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.700
See, I make that another example, Adrianne.
The exact same thing.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.600
- I don't know what you mean.
- Why reach out, saying something like that...

39:18.600 --> 39:21.800
- and meanwhile you think I'm a dope?
- I don't think you're a dope.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.700
That is so far off what I think.

39:23.700 --> 39:26.600
Tell Greg to tell me you're gay.
Then I hear rumors you're not gay.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.300
- You should be more straightforward.
- James.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.700
I'm not sayin' be straight.
Be whatever you want.

39:32.600 --> 39:35.600
I don't know what I am.
I said what I said to discourage you.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.500
Because I didn't think we should go out.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.100
So today, you're gay or you're not?

39:41.300 --> 39:44.300
Once I said that...

39:44.200 --> 39:46.400
I thought maybe, like, I told,
like, a true lie.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.000
Because I never had a successful
relationship with a man.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.300
But I went to a meeting-
that G.0.A. L?

39:51.300 --> 39:55.300
- The gay officers club?
- The Gay Officer Action League.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.700
I didn't feel comfortable there.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.100
And now, since the meeting...

40:02.100 --> 40:04.800
I lie awake nights...

40:04.800 --> 40:09.500
'cause what I think is,
probably I'm straight.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.700
But I wind up with men that hurt me.

40:14.600 --> 40:19.300
It's my problem, James.
I just don't know how to be happy.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.200
Now that you figured that out...

40:26.200 --> 40:28.700
you took a vow not to learn?

40:28.600 --> 40:31.500
Huh?

40:35.100 --> 40:38.500
- Greg.
- Marie?

40:38.500 --> 40:42.200
- Who's watching the kids?
- Connie, from down the block.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.200
Greg, we can't let this happen to us.

40:45.100 --> 40:49.300
I think it has happened, Marie. Me moving
in here, that's just acknowledging the fact.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.300
No! No.

40:52.100 --> 40:55.200
- When you do blank,"I feel blank."
- Marie!

40:55.100 --> 40:58.600
Come on, Greg.
When you do blank,"I feel blank."

40:58.600 --> 41:02.300
Marie, to hell with the marriage counselor!
And to hell with doing blank."

41:02.200 --> 41:04.300
When you do blank,"I feel blank."

41:04.400 --> 41:07.600
You're harping, Marie.
And that's what I can't stand.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.800
The moment I walk in from work,
it's a harping quality.

41:10.700 --> 41:14.000
- When you harp, I feel-
- I feel like moving out.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.300
- Good!
- When you nag me constantly and tell me how broke we are.

41:18.200 --> 41:22.100
- Good.
- You're inside my mind all day, remarking on my shortcomings.

41:21.900 --> 41:25.600
- Go for it, Greg!
- When you coach me during sex, it pisses me off!

41:28.600 --> 41:30.800
Greg?

41:33.600 --> 41:35.700
Do whatever you want.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.700
This is a public area, Marie.

41:39.700 --> 41:42.500
People could walk in here any minute.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.600
No more coaching. Take me, Greg.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.300
So, you worried about your car?

42:23.700 --> 42:27.400
Oh, my car will be fine.

42:27.300 --> 42:29.200
I'm worried about you.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.400
You're worried about me, huh?

42:33.600 --> 42:36.900
I don't want to hurt you,
James, if it doesn't work out.

42:36.800 --> 42:40.200
Adrianne, maybe you spend so much time
worrying about other people...

42:40.200 --> 42:42.200
you don't think much of yourself.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.900
So you figure only
a jerk would ask you out.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.800
The kind of guy
that would raise his hand.

42:46.800 --> 42:51.400
Well, I won't raise a hand.
And I like you plenty.

42:53.100 --> 42:57.500
I'll tell you something else. I don't care
what Andy and them say about my clothes...

42:57.400 --> 43:00.500
I got good taste.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.700
I like it when you smile.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.200
I like it a lot.

43:05.100 --> 43:07.400
I'm gonna make you smile all the time.

43:18.200 --> 43:22.200
Come on inside, James.
We'll have some coffee.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.400
I thought you'd never ask.
