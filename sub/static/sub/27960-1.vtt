Well, let me explain.

When I fled the genocide
of Rwanda,

53:42.393 --> 53:44.873
I lost every material
thing I ever owned.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.527

escaped death several times.

53:53.186 --> 53:54.448
So now,

53:55.232 --> 53:59.061

as a loan from God,

54:00.976 --> 54:03.414

the rest of my days

A loan from God.

54:10.986 --> 54:12.727

54:17.863 --> 54:19.256

Hello from Nairobi, Kenya.
My name is Andrea Hartley,

01:43:37.776 --> 01:43:39.169
and I hope that experiencing
our story

01:43:39.343 --> 01:43:41.084
has encouraged and inspired you.

01:43:41.258 --> 01:43:44.174
Our lives were forever changed
when my family sponsored Umuhoza

01:43:44.348 --> 01:43:46.045
through Compassion
International.

01:43:46.611 --> 01:43:49.571
Though Compassion takes care
of nearly two million children
worldwide,

01:43:49.745 --> 01:43:52.008
there are more than 200,000
children in waiting,

01:43:52.182 --> 01:43:55.272
children who are being taken
of through Compassion projects

01:43:55.446 --> 01:43:58.188
somewhere in the world,
but don't yet have a sponsor.

01:43:58.536 --> 01:44:01.278
They are waiting like Umuhoza
was waiting for my family.

01:44:01.713 --> 01:44:04.107
Would you consider helping
disciple one child

01:44:04.281 --> 01:44:05.717
in another country?

01:44:06.152 --> 01:44:09.155
Please text "I WILL"
to 83393

01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:11.027
and Compassion
will send you information

01:44:11.201 --> 01:44:13.029
on one child
who is waiting for you.

01:44:13.203 --> 01:44:14.291
Thank you.
