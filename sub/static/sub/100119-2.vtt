00:12.480 --> 00:14.960
[Hayley] Here! Over here!

00:15.040 --> 00:18.000
Help! Over here!

00:18.760 --> 00:20.280
Here!

00:21.640 --> 00:24.240
[doctor] She fell off a cliff
but a bush stopped her fall.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.760
She's badly bruised
and has difficulty breathing.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.480
Get me a chest tube. Stat!

00:37.200 --> 00:38.480
Our friend was brought here.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.760
You'll have to go to the waiting room.
Only family allowed.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.000
Let me take a look at that.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.520
-I'm fine. My friend--
-Young man, please sit down.

[indistinct announcement over PA]

01:46.880 --> 01:49.080
[indistinct chatter]

02:05.280 --> 02:06.600
You dropped something.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.680
What?

02:13.199 --> 02:16.360
There's gonna be a little skirmish
between a few inmates in a half hour.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.520
Use that key to hide in the laundry room.
Now.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.600
Oh, Soph.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.520
-Oh, my God, you okay?
-I'm okay.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.400
Who needs two lungs?

02:52.480 --> 02:53.320
[chuckles softly]

02:54.960 --> 02:56.960
When I saw you fall off that cliff...

02:57.040 --> 02:59.440
Thank God that shrub was there
to block your fall.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.760
I guess so.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.400
Though I wouldn't mind
something less thorny.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.120
Yeah, like a beanbag chair.
[chuckles softly]

03:07.200 --> 03:08.440
Don't make me laugh.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.240
Oh, Sophie. Oh, my God.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.160
It's so good to see that you're all right.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.440
-Dad, she's not all right. She's--
-Hey, hey. I'm fine.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.920
Brooke, can I talk to Sophie alone?

03:19.640 --> 03:21.200
Now, what were you thinking?

03:22.320 --> 03:23.560
Drinking that water?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.440
And not calling for help?

03:28.360 --> 03:31.040
I don't know. [sighs]

03:32.080 --> 03:33.160
We were trying to win.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.720
Oh, as always.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.880
-[Louis] How are you feeling, captain?
-Awful.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.440
-Sophie, I am so, so sorry. I--
-No, no, I'm sorry.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.800
[sighs] I...
I can't believe I let this happen.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.080
You fell, Sophie.
You didn't let this happen.

03:54.680 --> 03:58.760
-If anyone's responsible--
-It's... It's all my fault.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.200
All my fault. I'm their captain.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.560
[Hayley] <i>Nobody wanted to lose.</i>

04:05.640 --> 04:07.680
You know what the pressure is like
in this school.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.280
Which is my next question.
Why are you wearing Eagles colors?

04:11.360 --> 04:14.840
-That's on me, Ms. Woods.
-No, it's not.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.120
-I chose to wear this, Mom.
-[cell phone chimes]

04:19.760 --> 04:21.480
[Ryan] Oh, that's your dad.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.560
I need to sign some papers
to release Alex.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.200
Daniel, you'll look after Hayley for me?

04:27.280 --> 04:29.680
-Yes, Ms. Woods.
-Thank you. You can call me Ryan.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.640
Okay.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.040
-Bye, Mom.
-[Daniel mouthing] Ryan.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.560
[Hayley] What're you smiling about?

04:39.640 --> 04:42.440
The nurse told me to make sure
it doesn't get infected.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.160
-Thanks. I--
-Oh, seriously, it's no problem.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.480
It's the least I can do.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.200
You've been through so much.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.400
First, Aspen goes back to London,
leaving you all alone, and now this.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.800
It's tragic.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.480
Yeah, well, everyone's been through a lot.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
Not just me.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.040
Well, nothing from today would have
happened if Hayley hadn't switched teams

05:11.120 --> 05:12.920
and started everyone fighting.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.960
You know, now that I think of it,
maybe Hayley burned the flag.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.840
No, she would never do that.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.400
Who else could have done it?

05:23.880 --> 05:27.160
It was a routine leadership challenge.
They failed, unfortunately.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.760
-[sighs]
-I don't remember going out in the woods

05:28.840 --> 05:30.480
alone when I was at the Greenhouse.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.320
They weren't alone.
We always knew where they were--

05:32.400 --> 05:35.040
Louis, if those bushes
hadn't stopped Sophie's fall...

05:35.120 --> 05:36.440
But they did.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.360
Everything's okay now.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.440
It's not okay.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.520
The other parents are upset, too.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.880
Those were our kids out there.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.920
They pushed themselves too far.
They could have died.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.440
Ryan, don't you think
that's a little extreme?

05:48.520 --> 05:50.840
[Carter] Louis, there's going to be
an investigation into this.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.920
The state won't let this thing
go untouched. They want answers.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.040
And they've asked me to help get them.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.440
Is that what this is?

05:58.600 --> 05:59.920
The beginning of an interrogation?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.200
[scoffs]

06:01.800 --> 06:03.120
If you'll excuse me.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.760
Thank you for staying with me out there
and taking care of me.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.840
You should probably call Jackie
and tell her how you are.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.920
She might be seeing all of this
on the news.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.400
-Emma, I should tell you that--
-[Emma] I...

06:26.480 --> 06:27.880
I should call Leaf, too.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.880
[knocking at door]

06:41.560 --> 06:43.600
Well, it's nice to see you guys, too.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.520
What are you doing here?
Aren't you an Eagle now?

06:47.600 --> 06:48.600
[sighs softly]

06:49.280 --> 06:50.320
I guess I am.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.480
Here to pick up my stuff.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.880
Leo, you're our captain.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.720
You have to do something.
You can't just let her leave.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.520
Yeah, Hayley's not an Eagle.
She's... one of us.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.120
[sighs]

07:43.880 --> 07:45.560
[indistinct chatter]

07:46.200 --> 07:47.840
Sophie texted from the hospital.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.600
-She's already bored.
-[Alex chuckles]

07:50.680 --> 07:51.880
-Not surprised.
-[Parker] Of course.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.000
[Hayley] Hey, Eagles.

07:53.560 --> 07:58.040
[Daniel] Hey!
Oh, what's up, babe? Mmm.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.120
Feel free to stay as long as you want.
Maybe even forever.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.800
Hey, don't let this guy pressure you.
That's my job.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.600
-[Daniel] Mmm-hmm.
-Definitely stay forever.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.280
-[chuckles softly] I love you, bro.
-I love you, too.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.200
Come on. Let's get a bed set up for you.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.800
-Oh, she can have mine. Yeah.
-[reporter] <i>Mr. Osmond, tell me why</i>

08:24.280 --> 08:26.440
-[Daniel] Hey! There it is.
-[Eagles cheering]

08:26.520 --> 08:27.920
Seth, thanks, bro.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.480
[chuckles] Don't thank me.
Louis sent them over. Come on, guys.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.960
Hmm, Louis sent them over.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.280
[reporter] <i>Mr. Osmond, can you tell me why</i>
<i>the children of the Greenhouse </i>

09:09.560 --> 09:10.680
[Daniel] What're you doing here?

09:13.040 --> 09:15.440
My guess is the same as you.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.160
Whoa.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.960
[scoffs] I knew Davies got there
way too fast.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.200
Your coach was the rat.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.160
Whoa, hey, Coach Davies is a good guy.
He wouldn't have done this on his own.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.120
You think Louis told him to do it?

09:52.680 --> 09:55.160
[sighs] Look, we can't tell anyone
about this.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.240
Louis could get in really big trouble.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.280
Whoa, are you kidding?
I can't hide this from Hayley.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.600
You know her.
She can read people like a book.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.520
[sighs] Yeah, I know.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.320
But she can keep a secret, though.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.120
No.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.120
No, she shouldn't have to.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.520
And we think Louis
was just trying to divide us.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.120
To make us compete again.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.520
Hey, my dad may have wanted us to compete,

10:21.600 --> 10:24.040
but he never meant for us
to fight with each other.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.960
He didn't steal our iodine pills.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.320
He also didn't cheat or hide the sign.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.200
I think the Ravens deserve an apology.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.640
-[Hayley scoffs]
-Yeah, you first.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
Make me.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.160
You know, you've got real bold lately.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.880
Yo, enough, guys.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.760
This is not about
the Eagles versus the Ravens.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.480
It's about the Greenhouse.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.120
What're we gonna do tomorrow when they
question us about what happened?

10:46.200 --> 10:48.800
[scoffs] So, what, you want us to lie?

10:48.880 --> 10:49.720
[Leo] No.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.640
Look, we just want everyone's opinions
on what to do.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.520
[Becca] If we tell people what Louis did,
he could get in trouble.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.240
Maybe even fired.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.160
[Parker] Wait, what?

10:59.240 --> 11:01.320
Like, you think the school
would close down or something?

11:02.200 --> 11:05.400
I mean, wouldn't they just
find someone to replace him?

11:05.480 --> 11:07.560
No one can replace my dad!

11:08.560 --> 11:10.160
He is the Greenhouse.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.680
She's right. We should cover for him.
It's our faults that we got hurt.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.440
[scoffs] What? No, it isn't, Alex.

11:18.160 --> 11:23.840
Guys, none of this would have happened if
they didn't push us to fight each other.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.480
Look, guys, I think we should vote.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.560
And we should all honor
whatever we decide.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.440
-All right?
-[Leo] Yeah.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.040
So, all those in favor of telling
what we know about Louis?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.280
And all those in favor
of keeping things quiet?

11:51.320 --> 11:53.280
All right. Then we've decided.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.080
This never happened.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.440
Everything that you knew
before you walked in here tonight

11:58.520 --> 11:59.440
is what you tell them tomorrow.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.480
We competed, we fought...
and we took it too far.

12:06.520 --> 12:07.360
Okay?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.560
-All right.
-[Daniel] Okay, guys.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.960
Hey, uh, you good?

13:16.480 --> 13:19.240
Why was your entire team dehydrated
at the end of the hike?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.120
We left our iodine pills at the river.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
It was our fault.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.920
We decided to go on without them
because we wanted to win the challenge.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.880
Why was it so important for you
to win at all costs?

13:29.960 --> 13:31.600
Especially your health?

13:32.200 --> 13:33.520
It's the Greenhouse.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.120
He was testing it for me.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.240
Because he was protecting me.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.960
True love makes even
the smartest man a fool.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.880
[Ms. Hayes] Why didn't you use
your walkie-talkie after Max got hurt?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.480
Max wanted us to go on without him.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.080
He wanted our team to win.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.920
We all did.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.080
You lost a member of the Ravens
to the Eagles.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.000
Why do you think that happened?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.080
Hayley wanted a change.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.680
Um, a fresh start.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.320
Fresh start from what, exactly?

14:18.480 --> 14:21.240
There was some fighting
between the houses.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.440
Some of the people on her team thought
it was Hayley's fault, but it wasn't.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.120
Then whose fault was it?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.320
Who burned the flag?

14:34.320 --> 14:35.560
We were just messing with them.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.520
Uh, we didn't think they'd get so upset.

14:38.600 --> 14:43.960
So, you joined the team that had
just burnt your own team's flag?

14:44.040 --> 14:45.160
Did Daniel say that?

14:45.240 --> 14:46.400
Is that what happened?

14:50.480 --> 14:52.120
Yes. It was a prank.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.000
Really?

14:54.800 --> 14:55.640
Really.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.160
Nobody meant to get hurt.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.200
What if Hayley tells about my dad?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.760
She wouldn't break a promise.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.000
But she voted against us.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.120
I mean, she's not really
an Eagle yet, so...

15:12.200 --> 15:14.960
No, I know her. She won't rat.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.400
[Sophie] Hey, guys.

15:17.040 --> 15:17.960
-[Daniel] Hey!
-[Alex] Sophie!

15:18.040 --> 15:19.200
Oh, my God, you're back?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.760
[Alex] It's so great to see you.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.880
-Hey! Oh.
-[chuckles softly] Hi.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.360
-How are you? Okay?
-[Daniel] Soph!

15:25.440 --> 15:28.320
-[Brooke] Sophie!
-Hi. Ooh! [chuckles]

15:28.400 --> 15:29.840
-[Brooke] Here, let me take your bag.
-Thank you.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.120
[Daniel] How you doing, girl?
Good to see you.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.040
[Sophie] Yeah.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.400
[Alex] Hey, Soph, you feeling better?

15:34.480 --> 15:36.440
Yeah. Ugh, I couldn't stay in that...

15:36.520 --> 15:38.080
-Sit down.
-...hospital another day.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.680
Plus, I heard something about
an investigation. What's going on?

15:42.760 --> 15:44.400
Ah, it's nothing, really.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.240
We actually found out
Louis had Coach Davies

15:46.320 --> 15:48.720
-mess with us in the woods.
-What?

15:48.800 --> 15:53.040
Yeah. He's the one who burned the flags
and painted Leo's guitar.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.280
Seriously?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.600
But, I mean... [chuckles softly]

15:55.680 --> 15:57.360
You know, after having to listen
to Leo play all night,

15:57.440 --> 15:59.160
I'm surprised Coach
didn't smash that thing.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.880
[all chuckling]

16:01.920 --> 16:04.680
Wait, why are you all joking about this?

16:06.120 --> 16:08.640
What Louis did was awful.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.320
Hey, Soph, we were the ones
who took it too far.

16:11.880 --> 16:12.840
Not my dad.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.320
But... but why?
Like, why would he do that?

16:18.400 --> 16:21.120
We think to make us compete again.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.600
-[Alex] Yeah.
-[Daniel] Yeah.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.760
Sophie...

16:26.440 --> 16:29.920
we all took a vote last night
and decided to keep things quiet.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.200
You know, for my dad's sake.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.920
What do you mean?

16:35.160 --> 16:39.160
Well, I did it. I lied to my dad.
Like that's not gonna haunt me forever.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.560
Hey, Soph. How are you?

16:42.840 --> 16:44.680
Wait, so you all lied about what happened?

16:45.840 --> 16:49.160
Do you want my father
to lose his job over this stupid hike?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.920
I told you, we all voted for this.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.160
Yeah. Yeah, well...

16:59.280 --> 17:00.280
I'm not a liar.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.120
And I didn't vote.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.480
Sophie!

17:08.000 --> 17:10.440
-Is she serious?
-She's doing the right thing.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.119
Sophie, please. Don't do this.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.359
We could all lose a great leader.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.119
Maybe even lose this school.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.880
It's not our decision to make.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.359
What are you saying?
Are you trying to take my dad down?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.640
It's not like he pushed you
off that cliff.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.720
What are you talking about?
Brooke, I almost died.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.480
But it's not just about that.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.160
I would never pressure someone
to lie about what I did.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.800
My dad would never do that.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.000
No, he wouldn't. But you just did.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.960
Soph, I'm not pressuring you.
I am begging you.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.280
My dad has had such a hard time lately
with Jason and everything.

17:50.120 --> 17:50.960
Please.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.200
Don't do this.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.640
All right. Well, that's it.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.280
I'll report, uh, my findings
to the state board, of course,

18:08.360 --> 18:12.800
but I don't think any inappropriate
or criminal activity took place. Do you?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.160
No.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.480
Thanks.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.320
As hard as this was,
I'm glad everything was investigated,

18:19.400 --> 18:20.920
if it gives the state peace of mind.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.200
Absolutely.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.640
[knocking at door]

18:26.000 --> 18:28.480
-Soph.
-Sophie. You got released!

18:29.680 --> 18:32.400
Actually, I am here to be interrogated.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.840
Testify, what...
whatever you're calling this.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.320
Sophie, you were just in a major accident.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.720
You don't have to talk about anything.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.640
No.

18:44.080 --> 18:44.920
I want to.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.840
The thing is,
if Louis has taught me anything,

19:02.080 --> 19:05.000
it's that a great leader
should always speak their mind...

19:08.080 --> 19:09.560
keep their word, and...

19:11.000 --> 19:12.680
[chuckles softly] tell the truth.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.160
I'm sorry.

19:20.520 --> 19:24.160
Thank you, Sophie, for being
incredibly brave for the second time.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.280
Well... her statement changes everything.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.080
I'll have to report this
to the state board, of course.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.360
Mr. Osmond, I'm sorry,
but I must tell you,

19:43.440 --> 19:46.120
this probably does not bode well
for your cause.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.600
I understand.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.040
[indistinct chatter]

20:06.000 --> 20:06.920
[sighs softly]

20:09.320 --> 20:11.960
Sophie, what'd you tell them?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.240
[sighs] You...

20:18.360 --> 20:21.400
and you. I want to talk to both of you,
right now.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.400
[Parker sighs]

20:33.040 --> 20:34.120
Soph...

20:36.360 --> 20:37.320
You didn't.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.000
[sighs]

20:43.080 --> 20:46.840
Is it true? Was Louis
really responsible for all of this?

20:51.120 --> 20:53.480
-Yes, he was.
-[Carter sighs]

20:54.840 --> 20:57.280
-So, both of you just lied to my face.
-No.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.200
No, it wasn't like that.
We all took a vote--

21:00.280 --> 21:03.760
Oh, so you all came in knowing
you're going to lie to my face?

21:06.960 --> 21:09.160
I thought your mother and I
taught you better than that.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.480
[sighs]

21:33.840 --> 21:36.120
[Becca] <i>Yep.</i>
<i>I heard the whole thing.</i>

21:37.000 --> 21:39.360
-How?
-How do you think?

21:39.440 --> 21:41.080
My ear to the door.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.800
-Man, that girl has got some <i>cojones.</i>
-Thank you.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.120
I was talking about Sophie.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.520
Leo, what will happen to Louis?

21:49.440 --> 21:51.120
I don't know if he can
come back from this.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.720
-Oh, Brooke. Oh.
-[sniffles] Daddy.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.040
-[Brooke sighs]
-It's going to be okay.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.720
I resigned from the Greenhouse.

22:17.800 --> 22:18.640
No.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.320
Please, no, Dad!

22:20.400 --> 22:21.800
It's the right thing to do.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.720
And you know who
would have agreed with me?

22:25.520 --> 22:26.480
She would.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.120
She would've said, "Oh, Louis,
you've really stepped in it now.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.440
Better get some new shoes."

22:33.480 --> 22:34.760
What does that even mean?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.800
It means I have to move on.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.040
-Then I'm coming with you.
-Absolutely not.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.760
You're staying here.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.000
When your mother was dying,

22:46.600 --> 22:49.160
she made me promise that you and Jason
would grow up and study here,

22:49.240 --> 22:51.640
in this place that she so loved.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.000
And a wise young friend of yours
just reminded me,

22:58.080 --> 23:01.640
all great leaders always keep their word.

23:04.520 --> 23:05.640
All right?

23:13.920 --> 23:14.760
[sighs]

23:16.080 --> 23:17.880
-[gasping]
-[shushing]

23:17.960 --> 23:19.800
Hey, hey, little sis.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.600
I need your help.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.040
["The Way Back" playing]
