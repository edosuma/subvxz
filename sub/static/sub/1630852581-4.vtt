WEBVTT

00:09.920 --> 00:11.280
Gerald.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.200
Father Brown.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.000
Thank you.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.600
I haven't made a decision yet.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.200
Of course. I wouldn't expect you to
make a decision on the basis

00:28.200 --> 00:31.440
of a single letter.
But I'm glad you're even here.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.200
I've been thinking about what I did.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.080
It's all I've thought about.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.600
The person I was then.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.480
I can barely say his name.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.520
Kalon.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.880
Foolish.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.320
Confused.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.840
Murderous.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.520
And what now?

01:02.520 --> 01:07.520
The psychiatrists all say that
I've made a remarkable recovery,

01:07.520 --> 01:10.000
but that's what they said at
the last hearing.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.520
But if you were there...

01:13.360 --> 01:15.880
All I'm asking is that you hear
my truth.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.880
If after that you decide you can't
help me, then I'll accept that.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.520
You want me to gaze into your soul?

01:22.520 --> 01:25.120
And if what you see is good

01:25.120 --> 01:27.080
and it is in your heart to...

01:30.120 --> 01:32.160
You saved me once before,
Father.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.360
Please...

01:35.360 --> 01:37.080
..save me again.

02:11.200 --> 02:15.120
He threw his wife out of a window.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.160
Perhaps a cup of tea?

02:17.160 --> 02:20.080
Right. One cup of tea.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.600
And he brainwashed Suzie.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.640
Poor girl was never the same after.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.440
Small wonder she ran off with
a Buddhist.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.560
Suzie found her peace.
The question is, has Kalon?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.200
Gerald.

02:33.200 --> 02:38.080
Father, sometimes there's such
a thing as too much do-gooding.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.520
This is not about "do-gooding".

02:40.520 --> 02:43.440
This is about a second chance.
This is about redemption.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.040
So, you've already made up
your mind.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.760
I have done no such thing.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.800
Yes, I believe he's a changed man.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.920
And what brings you
to that conclusion?

02:57.960 --> 02:59.640
I have spoken with him.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.200
I have spent time with him.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.920
Obviously I am not trained
to offer a medical diagnosis,

03:08.920 --> 03:11.160
but as his spiritual adviser...

03:15.080 --> 03:19.520
..Gerald shows genuine remorse
for what he has done.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.360
He is tortured by it.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.000
And that agony can only come from
one place,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.520
a conscience.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.080
And if he were to be released,

03:30.080 --> 03:31.960
you would be willing to guide him

03:31.960 --> 03:35.160
through his re-assimilation into
society?

03:37.640 --> 03:38.920
Yes.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.640
Yes. Of course.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.560
Well, of course I tried, Sidney.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.560
The hospital will tell me
absolutely nothing.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.080
I'm going to see if he might...

03:54.080 --> 03:55.520
Oh, I think that's him now.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.040
Just get back here as soon as
you can.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.280
So, just how long does it take

04:03.280 --> 04:06.560
to sing the praises of
a murdering psychopath?

04:06.560 --> 04:10.600
I waited until the director of the
institution had made his decision.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.960
And?

04:23.520 --> 04:26.120
You have gone absolutely mad.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.600
I appreciate your concern,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.520
but I am asking you to trust me.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.880
I would not be doing this unless
I was sure.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.080
I promise you.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.200
I am not the "murdering psychopath"
you think I am.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.120
That man died a long time ago.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.680
You disgust me.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.800
Sid.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.640
"And the Astral Ancients did command
that we till

05:36.640 --> 05:42.200
"the soil to honour their gifts,
to entreat their favours.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.120
"We till the soil
to bless their light,

05:46.120 --> 05:50.600
"to summon their wisdom,
to beg for their healing."

05:51.680 --> 05:53.440
Let me do that. Are you sure?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.720
Of course. You need a break.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.480
I'm all right.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.920
If my daughter wants
the blessings of

05:59.920 --> 06:04.000
the Astral Ancients,
she has to earn them.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.680
Tell him, child.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.520
"In shadow are the slovenly,
denied their blessings."

06:09.520 --> 06:12.320
You may rest.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.880
All of you.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.960
She will be blessed a thousandfold
at the Solstice.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.520
She will be healed.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.200
Kalon?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.960
Tobias.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.800
Why are you here?

06:28.800 --> 06:31.560
To seek acceptance.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.560
To beg forgiveness.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.640
Is that why you've brought
a priest?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.040
Everything's
going to be all right now.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.280
What makes you say that?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.640
Kalon.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.560
Thank you.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.560
You've arrived
at an auspicious time.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.560
Chapters will be joining us from all
over the country for the solstice.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.720
Chapters?

07:12.720 --> 07:15.360
The religion has been flourishing.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.680
The student becomes the master.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.720
Forgive me for asking -

07:19.720 --> 07:21.520
your forehead markings?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.480
Oh, the five levels of
enlightenment,

07:23.480 --> 07:26.680
based on insights delivered
to me by the Astral Ancients.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.600
And what about the crystal balls?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.640
You telling fortunes now?

07:30.640 --> 07:32.600
They aren't crystal balls.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.240
They're spirit orbs.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.400
My mistake.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.600
It's all in here.
There's nothing to hide.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.200
Perhaps you'd like
a tour of our homestead after tea?

07:45.200 --> 07:47.320
Why have you returned?

07:47.320 --> 07:49.960
I wish to rejoin the order.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.800
You killed your astral partner.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.520
You have no right...

07:54.520 --> 07:56.000
It is not up to you.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.360
This does not concern you, Celeste.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.000
You weren't even here in
Kalon's time.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.800
Tobias saved us when you abandoned
this order.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.920
He brought us together.
He's our leader now.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.360
It's not my intention
to usurp his leadership.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.560
I wish simply to be amongst
the people of the sun.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.280
I will consider it.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.680
You can go.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Your mother's right.
He's a murderer.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.160
My mother doesn't know what she's
talking about.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.640
How do you think he can help you?
He's the founder.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.080
The seer of the light.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.000
If he can't help me, who ca...

08:35.000 --> 08:36.480
Clara? It's happening.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.880
Come.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.360
Astral Ancients, we beseech you
to channel your power

08:43.360 --> 08:44.720
through the lens of our bodies.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.720
To guide your light upon
the spirit of our daughter.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.600
We beseech you to calm
the storm inside her,

08:50.600 --> 08:53.720
to heal her with your blessed power.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.320
We beseech you, we beseech you.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.760
We beseech you.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.840
WORSHIPPERS: We beseech you. We
beseech you. We beseech you.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.400
The power of prayer is a miraculous
thing, isn't it, Father?

09:13.160 --> 09:15.160
What are you doing here?

09:15.160 --> 09:18.000
Please. Leave.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
We're a self-sufficient community.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.120
We grow our own food,
make our own clothes.

09:25.120 --> 09:29.040
But our ultimate destiny is
through here.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.840
The Sun Temple.

09:40.840 --> 09:44.200
A vision from the Astral Ancients.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.680
An instruction.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.400
To build a place for our people,

09:49.400 --> 09:52.440
to be close to them always.

09:52.440 --> 09:56.720
The Astral Ancients show a flair
for the extravagant.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.840
All the better to exult their glory.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.680
Wouldn't you agree?

10:01.680 --> 10:04.400
"Glory be to the Astral Ancients."

10:04.400 --> 10:06.920
First testament. Chapter three.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.400
Bet that cost a few bob.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.920
We've been pooling our resources
into investments

10:20.920 --> 10:23.800
and with the blessings and guidance
of the Astral Ancients,

10:23.800 --> 10:25.640
we will have our paradise.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.080
Our paradise. Not yours.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.480
You are not worthy
of this blessing.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.560
Thelma.
I want to speak to you alone.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.960
Later. Celeste, show our guests
back to the garden.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.200
Kalon, let us speak.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.880
Here.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.760
The originals.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.120
My legacy.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.040
Our legacy.

10:59.040 --> 11:03.280
There are undoubtedly others
who feel like Thelma.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.800
And with good reason.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.560
But let me speak to them,

11:06.560 --> 11:09.200
to all of them, at the solstice.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.480
If I'm rejected, so be it.

11:12.480 --> 11:16.280
But as your founder,
and your friend,

11:16.280 --> 11:18.360
I simply ask to be heard.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.400
BOTH: Astral blessings upon you.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.440
Astral blessings upon you.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.160
GONG RINGS OUT

11:36.160 --> 11:38.320
Our founder has returned to us,

11:38.320 --> 11:42.240
and with the blessings
of the Astral Ancients,

11:42.240 --> 11:44.720
he shall once again be one of us.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.480
Astral blessings upon you.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.240
GONG RINGS OUT

11:52.320 --> 11:57.240
Kalon, do you accept baptism
into the way of the light?

11:57.240 --> 12:00.680
I do. Do you vow to learn the
teachings of the Astral Ancients,

12:00.680 --> 12:02.920
to commit them to your heart?I do.

12:02.920 --> 12:07.440
Do you swear to abide by their will,
to submit to their authority?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.520
I do. No!

12:09.520 --> 12:11.600
You can't!

12:11.600 --> 12:14.960
You will not interfere with
the sacred ritual of baptism...

12:14.960 --> 12:17.520
But he's a murderer!

12:17.520 --> 12:19.640
We will speak of this later. Go.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.000
Kalon...

12:26.000 --> 12:27.240
..be anointed...

12:28.800 --> 12:31.720
..into the light.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.120
Be anointed.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.960
VARIOUS: Be anointed. Be anointed.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.000
That's where you keep
your spirit orb?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.520
Don't worry about Thelma.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.120
She thinks she knows the
Astral Ancients better than Tobias.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.960
But all she really knows is
how to manage the rotas

13:01.960 --> 13:03.200
and boss people about.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.440
If you need anything, talk to me.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.480
Thank you.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.280
Gerald!

13:31.280 --> 13:34.120
I asked you to leave.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.760
Not until you tell me
what you're doing here.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.120
You got my letter?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.560
I did.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.360
So THAT is why you came back?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.800
It is nothing like that.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.240
What, then?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.400
What's going on?

13:45.400 --> 13:46.840
My friend was just leaving.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.760
You give me no choice.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.400
I will telephone the institution

13:51.400 --> 13:53.560
and I will tell them
what has happened.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.840
Do as you must.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.480
Come.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.000
I never believed
the whispers about you.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.960
That's not how I remember you.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.800
You were kind, protective.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.360
Whispers?

14:10.360 --> 14:14.120
About the way you...treated women.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.040
Or the spiteful things
my mother says.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.840
But I know it isn't true.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.880
I communed with Dominique's
astral spirit.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.000
You did what?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.960
And she told me it was an accident.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.600
And now you're here,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.160
you'll heal me,

14:32.160 --> 14:33.960
and everything will be all right.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.800
Clara...uh...

14:39.240 --> 14:41.200
..there are some things
you need to know.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.440
Um... Someone must be in there.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.520
HE KNOCKS ON DOOR

14:53.440 --> 14:55.520
Hello?

15:01.360 --> 15:03.440
SHE SCREAMS

15:05.320 --> 15:06.400
Get Mallory!

15:08.600 --> 15:10.640
HE GASPS

15:15.440 --> 15:17.600
SHE SCREAMS

15:17.600 --> 15:18.920
She's dead.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.560
Thelma.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.160
Oh, no.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.160
No.

15:32.320 --> 15:37.880
May her astral spirit
rise unto the sun.

15:38.880 --> 15:43.360
May the Ancients draw her
into glorious union.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.440
May her light shine always.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.200
VARIOUS: May her light shine always.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.480
Windows are all bolted.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.120
Nowhere to hide.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.080
Maybe it was an accident. She fell.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.720
Sir, the magnifying glass - broken
during a struggle, perhaps?

16:12.720 --> 16:17.680
Do you see any signs of
a struggle in this room, Sergeant?

16:17.680 --> 16:20.640
Looks like these fell
out of her pocket, mind.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.160
"Phenytoin".

16:23.160 --> 16:24.680
That doesn't make sense.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.840
I told you to wait outside
with the others.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.360
Given my prior history
with this group,

16:30.360 --> 16:32.720
I thought I might be of assistance.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.280
Why doesn't it make sense, Father?

16:35.280 --> 16:38.680
The followers don't believe
in modern medicine.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.600
Only the natural healing remedies of
the Astral Ancients.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.960
Astral Ancients?

16:44.960 --> 16:47.600
Well, their spiritual forebears.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.480
It's in the book.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.480
Sergeant, homework.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.440
Padre, out.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.000
What's that on her fingertips?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.280
Hmm. Hmm.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.320
Black paint?

17:00.680 --> 17:01.760
Padre!

17:04.480 --> 17:06.160
Murder weapon.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.800
Looks like blood and hair.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.960
We'll take over
the investigation from here.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.760
There's broken glass on
the mantelpiece.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.840
Odd. Out!

17:20.000 --> 17:21.280
You found out who it is yet?

17:21.280 --> 17:23.000
No, not yet.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.960
Everything's going to be all right.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.560
How can you say that?
My mother's dead.

17:28.560 --> 17:33.040
Clara, I'm so sorry for your loss.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.760
Thank you.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.840
If you don't mind my asking,

17:36.840 --> 17:41.960
why did your mother wear
a magnifying glass around her neck?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.040
She used it for reading.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.360
And inspecting our cleaning.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.560
I see.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.400
Gerald, might I have a word
with you, alone?

17:55.440 --> 17:56.760
Right.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.840
We have a few questions.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.600
Sergeant. Sir.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.280
The victim has black paint
on her fingertips.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.520
Does that mean anything
to you at all?

18:05.520 --> 18:06.800
The marks of banishment.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.800
Three lines scored across
the forehead.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.520
So she was banishing someone
when she was killed?

18:12.520 --> 18:13.760
So it would appear.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.520
And who might she want to banish?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.560
She was found in your room?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.600
I bore her no ill will.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.160
Same can't be said of
her, though, can it?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.760
Meaning?

18:24.760 --> 18:28.480
She disapproved of my
re-initiation into the order.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.440
And why was that?

18:32.360 --> 18:34.120
You killed your wife.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.160
Sorry...

18:36.600 --> 18:38.400
.."astral partner"

18:38.400 --> 18:40.360
making it look like a fall,

18:40.360 --> 18:43.960
them staged a locked room
to cover your tracks.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.840
So this is a case of, if at first
you don't succeed...?

18:46.840 --> 18:48.040
I didn't do this.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.480
Yours are the only fingerprints
on the murder weapon.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.640
I wish to speak to Father Brown.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.000
Suddenly converted, have we?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.320
I thought you believed
in the astral fairies?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.040
KNOCK ON DOOR

18:58.040 --> 19:00.040
Father Brown's here, Sir.
Spiritual counsel.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.800
Speak of the devil.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.440
You can give him all the spiritual
counsel you like, Padre.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.920
It won't change a thing.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.240
Have you worked out
the locked room?

19:08.240 --> 19:11.240
I'll no doubt have it figured
out by the end of the day.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.280
In the meantime, I'm charging him
with murder. Goodfellow.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.520
Thank you, Sergeant.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.360
No more secrets.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.040
Tell me everything.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.480
Clara came to this order
when she was a child.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.160
It's all she knows,
and I'm responsible for that.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.120
Her mind and her life
poisoned by my delusions.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.920
You went back to save her.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.680
What was in her letter?

20:04.040 --> 20:08.280
She told me she was going to devote
herself to the order,

20:08.280 --> 20:10.320
that the religion had grown.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.440
She told me that she was sick,

20:14.440 --> 20:17.520
but she believed in
the Astral Ancients to...

20:18.680 --> 20:22.880
She wanted me to come back
and channel their power.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.680
But your plan wasn't to heal her.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.320
It was to tell her the truth.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.720
Not just her - all of them.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.400
At the solstice,
before the entire congregation.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.400
And say what? Tell them about
my sickness, my delusions.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.520
Tell them how I preyed
on their weaknesses.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.280
But you can't just rip someone's
faith from under them...

20:40.280 --> 20:41.560
That's what you did to me.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.720
Yes. I did.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.360
And you of all people know
the emotional consequences.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.680
Well, what are the consequences
of letting it go on?

20:49.680 --> 20:51.360
There are lives at stake, Father.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.640
Souls.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.960
Perhaps this is divine retribution.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.440
I'll almost certainly
hang this time.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.920
Which is why it's up to you now.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.560
Up to me?

21:11.680 --> 21:13.320
To finish what I started.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.920
GONG RINGS OUT

21:30.920 --> 21:33.080
We stand in the shadow of a tragedy,

21:33.080 --> 21:34.400
and it's my fault.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.720
It was I who allowed Kalon
back into the order.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.960
It was I who trusted too much.

21:41.960 --> 21:46.560
And it is I who must carry it
on my conscience.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.440
But at times like this

21:48.440 --> 21:52.120
we must open our hearts
to the light,

21:52.120 --> 21:55.560
and keep in sight
our glorious destiny,

21:55.560 --> 21:57.480
our paradise in the sun.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.640
Tomorrow is the solstice.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.360
It shall be a time of healing...

22:03.760 --> 22:05.880
..for us all.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.400
Continue your preparations...

22:11.760 --> 22:14.720
..which Celeste will now
be supervising.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.160
I came to offer my condolences.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.520
Thank you.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.040
Did Kalon say why he did it?

22:25.040 --> 22:28.160
I'm not entirely convinced
he's the culprit.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.840
Well, Inspector Mallory telephoned,
said they're charging him.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.800
I believe he's mistaken.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.160
So you think it was one of us?

22:36.160 --> 22:40.720
I did notice antagonism
between you and Thelma.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.000
On the matter of Kalon, yes.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.320
It turns out she was right.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.920
I was foolishly naive
to think he had truly changed.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.880
Blinded by my own feelings.

22:52.560 --> 22:56.040
Could not the same be true
of you, Father?

22:56.040 --> 22:59.800
Besides, what evidence do you have
to show that he's innocent?

22:59.800 --> 23:02.400
Nothing...yet.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.480
But if I could just see
his room again...

23:05.480 --> 23:07.360
What do you expect to find?

23:07.360 --> 23:08.400
How the killer escaped.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.560
Isn't that a job for the police?

23:11.560 --> 23:14.360
Yes, but a second pair
of eyes wouldn't hurt.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.080
You heard him.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.520
In any case,

23:17.520 --> 23:20.960
we are very busy
with our preparations,

23:20.960 --> 23:22.920
as you can see.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.040
My lady has spoken.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.440
But you're more than welcome
to come back tomorrow

23:27.440 --> 23:29.080
for our solstice celebration.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.080
It's open to the whole community.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.480
An excellent way
to recruit new followers, no doubt.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.960
No different from your church fetes,
wouldn't you say?

23:46.280 --> 23:47.680
Answer me.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.640
Please!

23:55.080 --> 23:57.120
What's the matter, Clara?

23:57.120 --> 23:59.200
My mother's astral spirit
won't manifest.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.240
Why do you think that is?

24:05.800 --> 24:08.440
Could it be something to do
with the pills in her pocket?

24:10.080 --> 24:11.640
Phenytoin.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.000
It's an anti-convulsant.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.400
The local chemist said
they'd dispensed some

24:17.400 --> 24:20.960
to a young man from your order
a few days ago.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.440
Your mother didn't just use
the magnifying glass

24:23.440 --> 24:25.800
for reading and inspection, did she?

24:28.960 --> 24:30.680
That wound's only a few hours old.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.080
How did that happen?

24:34.080 --> 24:35.760
After my attack,

24:35.760 --> 24:37.680
I went to commune with the sun.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.120
I want to show you something.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.680
Don't be angry.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.520
Albert. Where did you...?

24:50.520 --> 24:52.760
I faked a prescription.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.080
It's forbidden.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.520
Surely it can't be the wishes of the
Astral Ancients that you suffer.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.160
It is not ours to question
the wishes of the Astral Ancients.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.640
The chemist said it would help
with your seizures.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.320
I know you mean well.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.480
But you have to throw them away.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.640
Clara, please.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.360
Then I'll do it. No!

25:12.360 --> 25:13.960
I didn't take one.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.440
It's my fault. I-I bought them.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.600
Wait in my office.

25:24.680 --> 25:25.840
Skin.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.200
Astral Ancients,

25:30.200 --> 25:32.960
look down upon this wretched child

25:32.960 --> 25:37.880
and grant her forgiveness
for her blasphemy.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.160
I deserved it.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.480
No, you didn't.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.000
I angered the Astral Ancients.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.920
I had to pay penance.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.280
As a priest,
surely you must understand.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.240
As a priest,

25:51.240 --> 25:53.920
I find sometimes that
a literal reading

25:53.920 --> 25:57.840
of the scripture can lead you away
from the truth, not towards it.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.120
How did your mother's magnifying
glass get broken?

26:04.160 --> 26:06.360
I don't think you're
telling me everything.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.200
I raised my hand against her.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.360
Take this gift of skin
as penance for her weakness.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.120
SHE CRIES OUT

26:22.120 --> 26:24.280
GLASS SMASHES

26:27.000 --> 26:31.280
And now she has forsaken me.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.560
What are you doing?

26:34.080 --> 26:35.440
Talking.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.600
You're upsetting her.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.160
Was it you that Thelma
was about to banish,

26:41.160 --> 26:43.280
for bringing Clara the medication?

26:45.400 --> 26:46.480
Go.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.680
Are you all right?

26:53.280 --> 26:54.880
I didn't tell you to do that.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.320
Why don't you listen
to my instructions?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.600
Father?

27:11.600 --> 27:14.600
Father? What on earth are you doing?

27:16.240 --> 27:17.560
I'm going fishing.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.520
You're going fishing?

28:17.920 --> 28:21.840
Maybe he used some sort of
magnetic device to close

28:21.840 --> 28:23.800
the bolt from the other side
of the door.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.600
A magnetic device?

28:25.600 --> 28:28.400
You've been reading too much
science fiction, Sergeant.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.880
DOOR OPENS

28:33.480 --> 28:35.480
Apologies for the smell.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.520
The murder weapon.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.880
We already have the murder weapon.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.560
Yeah, thanks to your
eagle eyes, Father.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.440
I was wrong.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.160
Observe the fracture.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.920
It was cast into the pond
at the farmhouse.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.600
That doesn't prove anything.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.760
It could have rolled off one

28:50.760 --> 28:53.040
of their laps while
they were fondling it.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.120
I mean, you have to admit, Father,
apart from the crack,

28:56.120 --> 28:58.720
there's no evidence it was used
in the murder.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.880
Consider the fragments of glass
on the mantelpiece,

29:01.880 --> 29:04.120
made when the murderer
smashed Gerald's orb,

29:04.120 --> 29:06.120
to make it appear to be
the murder weapon.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.920
What about the hair and blood?

29:07.920 --> 29:09.680
Easily transferred from the victim.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.320
Listen to yourself, Padre.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.560
Spinning just-so stories,

29:13.560 --> 29:15.840
finding any excuse to get
the killer off the hook

29:15.840 --> 29:18.800
because your neck is on the line
for letting him out.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.120
On the other hand, Sir,

29:20.120 --> 29:22.400
we still haven't been able
to figure out that locked...

29:22.400 --> 29:23.920
Quiet, Sergeant.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.680
You're always preaching
about the truth, Padre.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.880
Well, here's a dose for you -

29:28.880 --> 29:30.640
you made a mistake.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.000
You lost this one.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.480
Now go home.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.040
I need to retrace Thelma's steps,

29:51.040 --> 29:53.720
then perhaps I can work out how,
as well as who.

29:53.720 --> 29:54.840
Father Brown.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.440
Welcome to our celebration.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.040
You've brought your
little friends, I see.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.680
Yes, I have.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.760
Tobias said that all were welcome.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.440
Of course.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
But please don't go in the house.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.280
That's private property.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.920
I was in your pond yesterday.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.040
You were what?

30:17.040 --> 30:18.400
I fell in.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.360
It was quite a spectacle.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.360
While I was in there,

30:22.360 --> 30:24.320
I found a spirit orb.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.880
It was cracked.

30:25.880 --> 30:29.240
Well...who knows how that got there.

30:29.240 --> 30:32.280
As I said, stick to the gardens.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.480
Astral blessings upon you.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.520
ALL: Astral blessings upon you.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.640
All right, I'll admit it,
she's a bit shifty.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.360
She looked as guilty as sin.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.920
Oh, where are you off to now?

30:49.560 --> 30:50.840
Oh!

30:51.920 --> 30:54.920
KNOCK ON DOOR, DOOR OPENS

30:57.200 --> 31:00.080
I just wanted to wish you blessings
for the healing.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.120
Thank you.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.280
What is it?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.920
It's our fault my mother's dead.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.040
What are you talking about?

31:09.040 --> 31:11.880
We angered the Astral Ancients.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.280
I should never even have
touched those pills.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.880
It wasn't your fault. Or mine.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.480
How else was she killed?

31:18.480 --> 31:20.320
There was no-one in the room.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.960
We-we saw it with our own eyes.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.080
She was punished
for our transgressions.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.680
That's not true.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.400
It was against the Word.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.480
Maybe the Word isn't all.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.640
Meaning?

31:35.640 --> 31:38.080
There are more important things.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.520
Like what?

31:39.520 --> 31:41.200
Like-like...

31:41.200 --> 31:42.440
What on earth are you...?

31:42.440 --> 31:43.560
Like love.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.720
I love you.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.760
And I think you feel the same way.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.600
I just want you to be well.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.480
The Astral Ancients
will make me well.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.000
But what if the Astral Ancients
aren't...? Stop it!

32:04.000 --> 32:07.200
Stop! Please.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.240
How can I love someone
who doesn't believe?

33:20.440 --> 33:22.040
The tabernacle.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.360
Oh.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.720
Of course.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.760
SHE HUMS

34:25.080 --> 34:26.920
SHE GASPS

34:34.360 --> 34:36.760
Where on earth is Father Brown?

34:38.120 --> 34:39.800
Oh.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.960
Would you be so kind as
to telephone the police station?

34:43.960 --> 34:45.840
I'm about to apprehend the killer

34:45.840 --> 34:48.120
and I would like Inspector Mallory
here for the arrest.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.680
You sure about that?

34:49.680 --> 34:51.320
I've never been more certain.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.320
There's a telephone in the hallway.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.440
Right.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.440
So who is it?

35:02.240 --> 35:03.400
Look at this.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.880
Kalon. He must have done that
before he killed Thelma,

35:06.880 --> 35:09.200
denouncing his own words.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.080
We shall not speak of him today.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.360
Today is for healing.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.360
GONG RINGS OUT

35:20.200 --> 35:21.920
Please...

35:21.920 --> 35:24.480
..on this joyous day of solstice...

35:25.920 --> 35:29.000
..we pay thanks to
the life-giving sun.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.000
We revere its ancient power

35:33.000 --> 35:35.960
and we celebrate
its glorious light.

35:40.560 --> 35:44.800
The Astral Ancients
are here with us today,

35:44.800 --> 35:48.920
and together we shall
channel their healing power.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.600
Clara.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.880
Astral Ancients,

36:02.880 --> 36:05.480
we beseech you to guide
the light upon

36:05.480 --> 36:08.440
the spirit of this, your daughter.

36:08.440 --> 36:12.720
Touch her with your healing power,

36:12.720 --> 36:15.840
to burn away the sickness
inside her.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.120
We beseech you.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.720
VARIOUS: We beseech you.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.400
We beseech you.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.840
We beseech you...

36:23.840 --> 36:24.960
I can feel them.

36:27.040 --> 36:32.360
I can feel them.We beseech you.
We beseech you.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.720
We beseech you. We beseech you...

36:34.720 --> 36:37.400
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

36:39.560 --> 36:40.680
Clara.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.000
Continue.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.600
Look down upon this,
your fallen daughter,

36:44.600 --> 36:46.280
and bathe her in your light.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.160
Cast out the shadows of sickness,

36:49.160 --> 36:51.640
burn away the torment
that plagues her.

36:51.640 --> 36:52.680
Stop it!

36:54.200 --> 36:56.480
Clara. Clara.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.840
It didn't work.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.880
The Astral Ancients are condemning
me, just as they did my mother.

37:06.880 --> 37:10.720
Clara, you are not being condemned.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.160
Thank you, Father,
but this is an internal matter.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.000
Tobias...

37:16.600 --> 37:20.320
..was it an internal matter
when you murdered Thelma?

37:20.320 --> 37:22.200
GASPS

37:23.840 --> 37:26.040
That is a despicable accusation.

37:27.080 --> 37:31.520
You killed her because
she discovered your secret.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.200
What secret?

37:33.200 --> 37:36.040
After she interrupted
the initiation,

37:36.040 --> 37:38.560
Thelma didn't go to Kalon's room.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.440
There were no black marks
on the door.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.520
She went to your study.

38:16.440 --> 38:17.760
What's this?

38:20.960 --> 38:23.080
Bankruptcy.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.840
History of bad investments.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.640
All your money lost.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.040
Your paradise in the sun has gone.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.800
Whatever he has there is a forgery.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.320
Father Brown has been
an enemy of this church

38:39.320 --> 38:41.920
for a long time.
It's a personal vendetta.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.320
She threatened to expose you,
didn't she?

38:44.320 --> 38:46.920
You've been lying to us.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.360
HE SCOFFS

38:48.360 --> 38:49.880
No.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.240
No, no, this is just
a setback, that's all.

38:53.240 --> 38:56.240
We're sure to recruit new members
at the solstice.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.720
The others have a right to know.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.960
The Astral Ancients are guiding me.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.360
They have a plan.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.800
The Astral Ancients speak to me too.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.840
I will be guided by them.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.360
You dare defy me?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.720
You are not our saviour.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.120
You are a liar
and you are a hypocrite.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.480
And everyone shall know.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.880
No!

39:23.960 --> 39:25.160
An evil lie.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.600
But now you had a problem.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.680
Dead body in your office,

39:30.680 --> 39:32.920
murder weapon in your hand.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.040
You needed someone to frame,

39:35.040 --> 39:37.280
and who better than the man

39:37.280 --> 39:40.360
the victim had antagonised
only moments ago?

39:41.440 --> 39:45.200
So you dragged her to Kalon's room,

39:45.200 --> 39:48.800
and my guess is you saw him.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.800
SHE GASPS

39:52.800 --> 39:56.240
I'll explain later. Clean up
the mess. And get rid of that orb!

39:56.240 --> 39:57.280
Go, go!

39:58.560 --> 40:00.600
So now we're both in on this,
are we?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.080
You're a fantasist, Father.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.880
You bolted the door,

40:05.880 --> 40:06.920
prepared the scene.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.120
But you were disturbed.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.800
Someone must be in there.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.840
KNOCK ON DOOR

40:15.800 --> 40:17.840
Hello?

40:17.840 --> 40:20.760
There was no place for you to hide,
except behind the door.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.040
And now you had another problem.

40:26.040 --> 40:29.200
How to leave your hiding place
without being seen in

40:29.200 --> 40:31.280
the mirror opposite the door.

40:33.320 --> 40:37.480
Which is why Celeste provided
you with a distraction.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.000
SHE SCREAMS

40:40.000 --> 40:41.040
She's dead.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.120
It's all lies!

40:45.080 --> 40:46.440
It's all lies.

40:46.440 --> 40:49.640
He's on a crusade to destroy
any religion that's not his own.

40:53.840 --> 40:58.040
Tobias, I'm here to expose
you as a liar...

40:59.600 --> 41:02.880
..a manipulator, and a murderer.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.680
You said you killed her for me.

41:07.680 --> 41:11.160
CAR APPROACHES
SIREN RINGS

41:22.400 --> 41:24.640
HE GRUNTS

41:24.640 --> 41:25.920
Get off me.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.800
I don't understand.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.640
If I'm not responsible,
why am I being punished?

41:40.640 --> 41:41.840
You're not being punished.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.160
BELL RINGS

41:49.640 --> 41:51.880
Good morning. You're very welcome.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.240
It's on the front
of the newspapers -

41:54.240 --> 41:56.120
"Religious cult goes bankrupt."

41:56.120 --> 41:57.880
Good morning, Mrs Harrington.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.400
Good morning.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.080
Oh, and, Father,

42:01.080 --> 42:03.720
I'm very sorry that I
ever doubted you.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.960
No apologies necessary.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.200
Well, at least that's

42:07.200 --> 42:11.480
the last we'll be seeing
of those deranged lunat...

42:11.480 --> 42:14.480
Would you have room in your
congregation for a few more?

42:14.480 --> 42:18.320
There is always room in the House of
God. Is that not so, Mrs McCarthy?

42:18.320 --> 42:21.800
What? Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.560
Thank you.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.800
It is splendid to see you
looking so well.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.040
Thank you, Father.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.640
Yes, you look better too.

42:31.640 --> 42:35.000
Much better than in that tunic.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.680
Clara's seeing a doctor.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.240
And the others?
Many have gone their own way.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.920
But I'm helping those who want it,
and they're helping me.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.440
Are you coming inside?

42:45.440 --> 42:48.960
You saved me. You saved us all.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.640
From incarceration, perhaps.

42:50.640 --> 42:53.200
But only God can grant salvation.

42:53.200 --> 42:56.080
I don't deserve it.Yes, you do.
After the things I've done.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.240
God forgives.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.840
How do you do it?

43:00.840 --> 43:02.160
Do what?

43:02.160 --> 43:04.280
See the good even
the darkest of souls.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.160
Because it's there.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.200
And I see it in you.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.720
Thank you, Father.
