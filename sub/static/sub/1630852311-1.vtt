00:05.214 --> 00:10.427
Video games are one
of the most powerful mediums ever created.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.931
This merger of imagination and technology

00:14.139 --> 00:18.685
has introduced a fundamental
evolution in human interaction.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.437
Damnit!

00:22.022 --> 00:24.733
And now represents a culture

00:24.816 --> 00:29.154
of 2.4 billion gamers connected worldwide.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.823
Yes!
Move!

00:31.907 --> 00:35.035
But just 20 years ago, the console

00:35.118 --> 00:37.704
that kicked off the era of online
gaming in the living room...

00:37.788 --> 00:39.248
Oh my God!

00:39.331 --> 00:41.166
Almost didn't exist.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.169
Do you ever want to make hardware?

00:45.128 --> 00:47.631
No, that's one thing
that we decided not to do.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.467
The idea that Microsoft
could ever create a game console

00:50.551 --> 00:52.427
- was seen as a bit of a joke.
- Microsoft?

00:52.511 --> 00:55.681
They wear khakis and they're boring
and they're Office and they're Windows.

00:55.764 --> 00:56.849
You might as well call it Nerd Box, right?

00:56.932 --> 00:58.642
I can't imagine how it could be better.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.979
A new console was seen as a risky bet.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.230
There it is.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.024
At a company not accustomed to losing.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.360
You're proposing taking
money away from Windows

01:08.443 --> 01:10.946
in order to fund some game system?

01:11.029 --> 01:13.407
That is an insane business to get into.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.158
It was fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.327
We're gonna make it, aren't we sir?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.582
This is the story
of how a passionate group of gamers

01:21.665 --> 01:24.835
forever changed
the course of a corporate titan.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.129
They saw the future.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.173
Broadband internet to the television set.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.966
Like, you can do that?

01:31.049 --> 01:33.552
And then Bill says, "We should do this,
we should let these guys do this."

01:33.635 --> 01:37.514
And the journey
to get that controller into our hands.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.600
This thing is gonna be the most
badass thing you can imagine.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.476
Fire at will!

01:41.894 --> 01:44.146
Think about the way you could
tell stories with that.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.689
No matter where you are in the world,

01:45.772 --> 01:48.358
we can all be part
of one bigger community.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.486
We need this,
this is like the hotline for us.

01:53.906 --> 01:57.201
We take it for granted now, but back
then this was like science fiction.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.952
We weren't sure how we were gonna do it.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.829
Xbox, watch tv.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.206
Oh God.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.249
Oh, hell no, Microsoft!

02:04.333 --> 02:07.544
Gamers are not gonna be
tolerant of any level of at all.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.755
The risk here was enormous.

02:09.838 --> 02:14.176
You're always just one catastrophic
bug away from not making it.

02:14.259 --> 02:18.972
I remember thinking,
"Hey, maybe we're in over our heads."

02:24.603 --> 02:27.648
There's a new contender
in the video game wars.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.733
Xbox is going to be the future.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.026
Truly the future of video games.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.445
- Xbox.
Taking over the living room.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.864
Limitless, connected
digital entertainment.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.282
You guys never understood.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.660
The company is going
to face fierce competition.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.286
Sniper! Nooo!

02:41.370 --> 02:42.913
It's a ticking time bomb.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.748
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.708
Xbox, getting a major overhaul.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.503
A bold vision for the future of gaming.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.380
It's the Xboooooooooooox!

03:07.855 --> 03:11.358
Hello. I'm Bill Gates.
Chairman of Microsoft.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.153
In this video,
you're going to see the future.

03:16.822 --> 03:21.410
Microsoft first came up
with the Windows concept back in 1983.

03:21.493 --> 03:25.497
I'm going to show you real quickly
a couple highlights from the product.

03:25.581 --> 03:30.002
The graphics interface is
an integral part of this new generation,

03:30.085 --> 03:33.589
that take PCs much further
than they've gone before.

03:33.672 --> 03:38.760
When I came to Microsoft in 1987,
the average age was 27, and I was 27.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.096
We were an amazing young company

03:41.180 --> 03:43.348
with an amazing
young founder in Bill Gates.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.809
He knew business better
than anybody out there,

03:45.893 --> 03:47.686
and he also knew technology.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.190
He was able to synthesize things
that nobody else in the industry could.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.067
It was incredibly fast moving.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.112
It was the kind of place
where people didn't hold back.

03:57.196 --> 04:00.157
For someone who just wanted
to really let loose and grow

04:00.240 --> 04:01.992
and learn, it was an amazing place.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.786
Bill Gates and the team
back then were the disruptors,

04:04.870 --> 04:06.580
which was exciting and palpable.

04:07.039 --> 04:11.043
We just thought of ourselves,
kinda like rebels, kinda, you know,

04:11.126 --> 04:13.629
where, where the big companies like IBM
were these huge companies,

04:13.712 --> 04:16.215
but we were this little
rebel group of hackers,

04:16.298 --> 04:17.966
you know, doing this cool work.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.261
I'm very optimistic
about where we're going.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.139
But that really changed in '95.

04:24.223 --> 04:27.142
Windows '95
has taken over computer stores.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.394
They were on line
in the middle of the night,

04:29.478 --> 04:34.274
personal computer users packed into stores
dying to get their hands on one.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.109
When Windows '95
launched it was like

04:36.193 --> 04:38.362
a coming-out party for the whole company.

04:38.445 --> 04:43.283
Microsoft made a thing
that everybody in the world wanted.

04:43.367 --> 04:47.496
It was like air to me, it just was.
It existed and you needed it.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.499
Today's world, you can't make it
without a computer.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.460
It has thousands of programs
that some of us may need.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.755
I can run three or four applications
at the same time.

04:56.839 --> 05:02.678
Windows '95 is so easy,
even a talk show host can figure it out.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.887
Oh!

05:03.971 --> 05:05.055
By the late '90s,

05:05.138 --> 05:08.809
Windows was dropping a billion dollars
to the bottom line every month.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.352
...3! ...2! ...1!

05:12.396 --> 05:13.981
No running!

05:14.565 --> 05:16.692
It was the most profitable business

05:16.775 --> 05:18.527
in the history of the human race.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.446
I don't think there's ever been
anything remotely like it

05:21.530 --> 05:24.449
unless you count the Spaniards
going to the New World

05:24.533 --> 05:27.536
and like, literally hollowing out
a mountain made of silver.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.959
Microsoft, which has a business
relationship with NBC,

05:34.042 --> 05:36.295
is the most powerful engine
in the new age of computers,

05:36.378 --> 05:38.130
a giant cash machine,

05:38.213 --> 05:40.340
and it strongly disagrees
with the government.

05:40.424 --> 05:43.635
In the late '90s we were sort
of the bad guys, the Death Star.

05:43.719 --> 05:48.182
The perception of Microsoft,
I think generally, was not great.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.436
They were in the middle
of the Justice Department monopoly issues.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.689
We were the big gorilla
in the room on most subjects.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.860
And so people viewed us
as sort of the big, bad tech company.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.615
By 1999, 90 percent of computers worldwide

06:04.698 --> 06:06.867
used the Microsoft Windows
operating system.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.036
They were untouchable,

06:09.119 --> 06:11.413
without comparison, or viable rival.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.917
We'd been successful
in the operating system world,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.418
built a huge PC business,

06:16.502 --> 06:18.587
built Microsoft Office
into this big business,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.130
we were the tech behemoth.

06:20.214 --> 06:24.468
Windows overtook that industry
and transformed the world,

06:24.551 --> 06:28.222
but during that period, disruption
was coming from all sides.

06:34.478 --> 06:38.690
For decades, Sony had been
a Japanese electronics giant

06:38.774 --> 06:42.277
with a history of producing personal
and home entertainment hardware.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.530
And then, in 1994,

06:44.613 --> 06:47.241
Sony struck gold with the PlayStation...

06:47.824 --> 06:50.452
a gaming console
with unparalleled success.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.746
The launch of PlayStation really

06:52.829 --> 06:55.707
thrust gaming into popular culture
in a big way.

06:55.791 --> 07:02.631
And Sony saw an opportunity for gaming
to be even bigger and touch entertainment.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.968
What Sony discovered was a console

07:06.051 --> 07:08.136
was really a Trojan Horse
to the living room.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.848
And once that device
got into the living room,

07:10.931 --> 07:13.433
it could be a multimedia
entertainment device.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.019
Sony was putting
different things into the home.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.273
They're putting a hard disk
here in like a DVR,

07:19.356 --> 07:22.818
they're putting memory here,
they're putting a processor here.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.404
And if they could connect
all those things together,

07:25.487 --> 07:27.239
it would be a computer.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.993
A potentially
existential threat to Microsoft.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.622
Without further ado,
let me introduce to you,

07:35.706 --> 07:38.792
the next generation
of PlayStation technology.

07:38.876 --> 07:42.504
Even before Sony launched PlayStation 2,

07:42.588 --> 07:46.967
they were just creating
this perception of inevitability.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.595
PlayStation 2 was the next big thing,

07:49.678 --> 07:52.055
and anything in its way
was going to get crushed.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.475
Finish him!

07:55.559 --> 07:57.936
They said our new PlayStation
is so powerful

07:58.020 --> 08:00.439
that it's gonna replace the PC.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.400
Sony was showing a slide at trade shows

08:03.483 --> 08:05.569
and to our customers of a future home

08:05.652 --> 08:09.114
that was full of PlayStations
and didn't have any PCs in it.

08:10.866 --> 08:15.454
Which was like shooting cannonballs
over Microsoft headquarters.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.625
It was an incredibly
arrogant thing for them to do,

08:19.708 --> 08:22.294
but it was pointed, too, I mean,
that was a very serious threat.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.464
In the '90s, Microsoft
was a paranoid place,

08:25.547 --> 08:29.009
and when somebody said Sony's gonna
put a PC in the living room,

08:29.092 --> 08:31.178
that got everybody's attention.

08:31.261 --> 08:35.807
And if Sony was at the point
of locking down the living room,

08:35.891 --> 08:37.768
what was Microsoft going to do?

08:40.229 --> 08:44.525
One possible answer was brewing
not from the top executive ranks,

08:44.608 --> 08:47.986
but from deep
within the Microsoft corporate structure.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.240
Four renegades
on the DirectX software team,

08:51.323 --> 08:53.367
who were working
on tech to help developers

08:53.450 --> 08:57.246
create games for Windows,
and who were united by a fervent belief

08:57.329 --> 08:59.206
that games were the future.

08:59.581 --> 09:04.962
I was leading the DirectX development team
with one of my colleagues

09:05.045 --> 09:08.590
on the marketing side
of DirectX, Ted Hase.

09:08.674 --> 09:12.427
You know the question
that we were starting to ask is,

09:12.511 --> 09:15.681
"Where was all this
graphics technology headed?"

09:16.014 --> 09:20.018
Windows had won
the desktop operating-system wars,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.313
so we were starting to ask
where there could be threats

09:23.397 --> 09:25.107
or opportunities in the future.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.360
We quickly narrowed down to games

09:28.443 --> 09:32.865
and an all-encompassing
entertainment platform for the living room

09:32.948 --> 09:35.158
as being an opportunity for us.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.203
Otto had carefully built
a career at Microsoft,

09:38.287 --> 09:40.289
and he had already taken a risk,

09:40.372 --> 09:43.542
because Otto could have been
an important programmer

09:43.625 --> 09:48.130
in a legitimate Microsoft group
like Windows or Office.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.175
Instead, he chose
to be in this DirectX group,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.719
because he was passionate about graphics.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.014
Ted and I both had folks on our teams

09:57.097 --> 10:01.393
we felt could bring some additional
brainpower to the conversation,

10:01.476 --> 10:03.145
including Seamus Blackley...

10:05.522 --> 10:08.984
How do you describe Seamus?
He's a, he's just a piece of work.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.736
One of the most brilliant people
I've ever met.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.072
Besides being a physicist
and a really amazing mathematician,

10:14.156 --> 10:19.077
Seamus really embodied the heart
of what it meant to be a game developer.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.623
When I saw arcade games when I was little,

10:22.706 --> 10:24.082
when I saw <i>Computer Space</i>,

10:24.166 --> 10:29.505
my first idea was not,
"I wanna play this game for hours."

10:29.588 --> 10:33.425
My idea was,
"How can I make my own thing?"

10:34.218 --> 10:37.221
One of Ted's employees was Kevin Bachus,

10:37.304 --> 10:40.933
who had a financial
and market analysis background.

10:41.016 --> 10:44.311
Kevin's like a Vulcan
in the best possible way.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.523
His interface to the world
is entirely intellectual.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.733
That is correct.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.528
We had day jobs for DirectX,

10:52.611 --> 10:57.407
but a lot of our thinking was how
we could build brand-new technology

10:57.491 --> 11:01.537
that was single-mindedly focused
on making the very best games.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.374
The four of us,
we played games, and we loved games,

11:05.457 --> 11:08.418
and we wanted to make them.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.963
That really meant something for us.

11:11.046 --> 11:15.050
They were working
on DirectX, a set of software tools

11:15.133 --> 11:16.885
that standardized game development

11:16.969 --> 11:19.137
across PC hardware, and which was readily

11:19.221 --> 11:21.431
embraced by PC game developers.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.936
But the team saw a way
to push DirectX further, with an idea

11:26.019 --> 11:29.690
that could revolutionize the foundation
of console game development.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.902
With Windows and DirectX,
we have the platform

11:33.986 --> 11:36.989
that everybody wants to do
the work on to make the games.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.617
We already have the entire infrastructure
of everything you need to create

11:40.701 --> 11:42.828
all this technology
sitting on our platform.

11:43.203 --> 11:48.417
If we could only create
a single hardware standard,

11:48.750 --> 11:52.379
a box designed just to run DirectX.

11:53.172 --> 11:56.800
It gave us the idea
that we could produce better games

11:56.884 --> 12:00.220
than Sony and Nintendo and Sega.

12:00.304 --> 12:04.892
At that time Japanese game consoles
had very proprietary chipsets

12:04.975 --> 12:08.270
and they just didn't work very well
for, you know, Western developers.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.814
The instructions on how to use
it would be in Japanese.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.610
What the DirectX group was proposing was,
there's a better way to do this.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.738
We're gonna use PC architecture
that you're familiar with,

12:17.821 --> 12:19.406
which is just gonna work out of the gate,

12:19.489 --> 12:22.284
so they can spend more time
crafting and building their games.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.287
They had
an incredibly developer-friendly story,

12:25.370 --> 12:28.165
you already know how to write these games
if you've written them for PC,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.667
you can write them for console as well.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.295
You know, that message is pretty powerful.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.717
For us, this was
about advancing the gamers' interest

12:38.800 --> 12:42.971
and the game developers' interest,
which would advance Microsoft's interests.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.557
So we decided that this was the right time

12:45.641 --> 12:49.561
to try to build support for the idea
of Microsoft building a game console.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.356
At the same time, nobody ever believed

12:52.439 --> 12:56.527
that Microsoft would actually have
the audacity to attempt such a thing.

12:57.736 --> 13:02.574
The four of us, we were on a
journey to get support for this crazy idea

13:02.658 --> 13:06.662
around putting a DirectX-powered box
in the living room

13:06.745 --> 13:09.289
to deliver interactive content.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.419
We were trying to crash meetings
and get traction on this thing.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.213
We were an annoyance.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.506
Nobody knows who the hell we are.

13:17.965 --> 13:22.427
And we were constantly discovering super
important people who were roadblocks,

13:22.511 --> 13:25.597
or who wouldn't get it,
and who didn't think games were important.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.976
You're proposing taking
money away from Office development

13:29.059 --> 13:32.187
in order to fund some game system?

13:32.646 --> 13:35.357
These people dreaded
having meetings with us.

13:36.525 --> 13:41.196
No surprise, displacing
the stated direction of a company

13:41.280 --> 13:44.867
at the scale of Microsoft
was not a trivial undertaking.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.745
Realizing that
who you knew inside of Microsoft

13:48.829 --> 13:50.747
was at least as important
as what you knew,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.500
we brought in the guy
who could try to build support

13:53.584 --> 13:55.669
for the idea of Microsoft
building our game console.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.795
Nat Brown.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.383
I had a lot of time spent talking
with different teams

14:01.466 --> 14:04.636
and working with kind
of long-term strategic planning.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.972
Nat had an incredible network
of connections.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.683
He opened up a lot of doors for us.

14:09.766 --> 14:13.061
Nat was sort of like our Obi-Wan Kenobi.

14:13.562 --> 14:17.608
This wizard figure who would show up
and go, "Oh, I know who you need to call.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.736
You need to talk to the guys
in this division or that division."

14:20.819 --> 14:23.614
He knew the structure to Microsoft.

14:24.198 --> 14:28.160
It's been nothing but a fight
to figure out how the place works.

14:29.453 --> 14:32.748
One of the first things Nat
said was we needed a proper code name.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.833
Something that would plant in peoples' head

14:34.917 --> 14:36.210
and take on a life of its own.

14:36.293 --> 14:40.964
Nat said, "Well, isn't it really
a DirectX box in the living room?"

14:41.048 --> 14:46.345
I'm like, "Yeah, it's like a DirectX box.
That's what it's about."

14:47.346 --> 14:50.599
And we just put up on the
board, let's call it the DirectX box.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.102
And so we had this awkward thing
in our mouths all the time.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.604
It was a DirectX box.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.690
And I remember saying,
"That's too long. It's just Xbox."

14:58.774 --> 14:59.942
And we liked that.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.527
That was our codename,

15:01.610 --> 15:04.112
as a stand-in, until we had
something better come along.

15:04.655 --> 15:08.075
We built a business case that
showed how big this business could be.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.536
To get buy-in on that
you have to distribute it,

15:10.619 --> 15:11.703
you have to go socialize it.

15:11.787 --> 15:15.541
My trick was getting our stuff
in front of executives

15:15.624 --> 15:18.168
to make them say,
"I want to understand this business."

15:19.628 --> 15:22.756
The team set their sights
on a logical choice,

15:22.840 --> 15:26.301
a senior executive who spoke
their language...literally.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.053
Yeah I'll play real quick.

15:28.136 --> 15:32.224
Ed Fries was a Microsoft lifer,
he joined as an intern.

15:32.307 --> 15:36.728
Ed had been critical
in the development of Office,

15:36.812 --> 15:40.816
one of the biggest franchises
even at that time that Microsoft ever had.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.360
He had this passion
for games, he loved games,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.779
he programmed a game at a very early age.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.406
When most high schoolers

15:47.489 --> 15:49.491
were getting their first
minimum-wage jobs,

15:49.575 --> 15:52.786
Fries was already cashing royalty checks
from his first game.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.455
So let's take a look
at this high-quality product.

15:55.747 --> 16:00.002
A clone of the hit arcade game<i>Frogger</i>, aptly named... <i>Froggy</i>.

16:00.085 --> 16:03.297
Highly original as you can see. Yeah!

16:03.380 --> 16:06.592
When I left Office to go run
the games group,

16:06.675 --> 16:09.094
people told me
I was committing career suicide.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.138
Thank you, that's it. Goodnight!

16:11.221 --> 16:12.973
They said, why would you leave Office,

16:13.056 --> 16:14.641
one of the most important parts
of the company,

16:14.725 --> 16:16.393
to go work on something
no one cares about?

16:16.476 --> 16:20.022
And when I got there, running the games
group, I found out they were right.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.941
No one cared about what I was doing.
And that was awesome!

16:23.567 --> 16:27.738
In '95, the games group was really small.
It was like 20 people.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.699
In a lot of these tech companies
there's not as much respect

16:30.782 --> 16:32.451
given for those other disciplines.

16:32.534 --> 16:35.829
Microsoft, at the time,
didn't care very much about games,

16:35.913 --> 16:37.247
I think we were just more of a hobby.

16:37.331 --> 16:40.584
We were gamers
working in like the bowels

16:40.667 --> 16:43.295
of some Microsoft corporate building.

16:43.378 --> 16:47.174
Our goal at the time was to push
Windows as a gaming platform.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.426
I always felt
like I was doing underdog stuff,

16:49.510 --> 16:51.428
and that's actually what I really enjoyed,

16:51.512 --> 16:55.349
I enjoyed trying to bring Microsoft
from behind in PC games.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.976
After Windows '95 launched,
we had to wear these t-shirts

16:58.060 --> 17:00.646
that said "Microsoft knows games."

17:00.729 --> 17:03.482
You know, it was obvious,
we didn't really know games,

17:03.565 --> 17:06.193
otherwise we wouldn't have had to put it
on our shirt, you know what I mean?

17:08.237 --> 17:13.700
Choose your favorite form
of world domination in <i>Age of Empires</i>!

17:13.784 --> 17:17.120
But after a couple of years
we launched <i>Age of Empires</i>.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.624
It was kind of crazy,
what a fascination that game became.

17:20.707 --> 17:25.295
And it was one of the signature
PC strategy games for years.

17:25.379 --> 17:29.508
That was actually a huge success for us,
and we started to do some acquisitions,

17:29.591 --> 17:31.051
and we were growing
our publishing business.

17:31.134 --> 17:35.055
As we started to ship more
quality games, we finally got to the point

17:35.138 --> 17:38.100
where we were respected in Microsoft,
and people were like,

17:38.183 --> 17:41.061
"Okay, Microsoft actually does know
what it's doing when it comes to games."

17:41.144 --> 17:44.106
Ed took
a broken games business and fixed it,

17:44.189 --> 17:47.776
and made it profitable,
and found a way to do it at Microsoft.

17:47.860 --> 17:51.655
These are difficult, double black belt,
aikido corporate moves.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.704
Steering the tiny PC games division

17:58.787 --> 18:02.291
into a profitable department
had won Ed the trust of Bill Gates,

18:02.374 --> 18:05.085
and yet Fries himself wasn't satisfied.

18:05.377 --> 18:08.046
Our PC market share
was growing into the teens,

18:08.130 --> 18:10.883
and at the same time we weren't doing
anything in the console space,

18:10.966 --> 18:13.343
and that to me
seemed like a bit of a waste,

18:13.427 --> 18:14.761
you know,
it was this huge market out there.

18:14.845 --> 18:18.891
One day, these guys from the DirectX team
walked into my office,

18:19.474 --> 18:23.187
and they pitched me
on this thing, the Xbox.

18:23.270 --> 18:27.524
And basically what they pitched
was a disguised PC.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.443
I thought, "Oh this is great.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.487
This is like a bridge for me
to get to the console business."

18:32.571 --> 18:36.533
This box that will run
a native version of DirectX,

18:36.617 --> 18:40.037
which is the part of Windows that's
really focused on the game developer,

18:40.120 --> 18:41.622
was revolutionary.

18:41.705 --> 18:45.751
It's gonna be easy to port
to this machine, easy to take my games

18:45.834 --> 18:48.712
and make them run, unlike
running on PlayStation at that time,

18:48.795 --> 18:54.718
or a Nintendo machine that were just
very alien hardware compared to a PC.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.554
Ed understood all this game development

18:57.638 --> 19:00.265
that was happening on the PC,
we wanted to make a console

19:00.349 --> 19:03.644
that was specifically designed
to be easy and fun to make games on.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.897
And if the most creative people
did their best work on your platform,

19:06.980 --> 19:09.024
that's really good business,
that's a good idea.

19:09.107 --> 19:13.529
Basically I said, "You know I'm in.
I like this idea. I wanna help you guys."

19:13.612 --> 19:18.242
The DirectX team,
these were troublemakers, upstarts.

19:18.325 --> 19:22.120
They didn't have
these reputations that Ed had,

19:22.204 --> 19:24.998
as sort of born
and bred to work at Microsoft.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.876
They didn't really have
any political clout within the company.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.419
It was, I think, a big win for them

19:29.503 --> 19:31.713
to get me on their side
from my point of view.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.343
This unlikely alliance
would bring the Xbox team

19:36.426 --> 19:40.764
closer to the biggest test of all,
pitching Bill Gates.

19:40.848 --> 19:44.893
And that opportunity would come
sooner than anyone expected.

19:47.855 --> 19:50.232
When Sony unveiled the PlayStation 2,

19:50.315 --> 19:53.902
they started talking about how they were
going to be the death of the PC.

19:53.986 --> 19:57.656
A new concept that we'd like to introduce
going into the next century,

19:57.739 --> 19:59.908
our EE, the Emotion Engine.

20:00.534 --> 20:04.121
It was like, what a great name.
Holy crap, you know, an Emotion Engine.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.958
Our new CPU architecture
significantly outperforms

20:08.041 --> 20:11.837
even the fastest Pentium III architecture
that's in the market today.

20:11.920 --> 20:16.884
They showed beautiful fighters,
models twirling around,

20:16.967 --> 20:19.720
they showed
a thousand delicate rose petals

20:19.803 --> 20:23.265
falling from the sky
to show just how many polygons,

20:23.348 --> 20:27.060
just the raw math that this behemoth
of a device could process.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.772
And guess what, it's got the power
of a thousand suns behind it!

20:31.356 --> 20:35.027
For Microsoft, that really
crystalized what the stakes were.

20:35.110 --> 20:38.155
And Bill asked the DirectX team
to do an analysis

20:38.238 --> 20:40.157
of these claims that Sony had made.

20:42.201 --> 20:47.664
As you can imagine, getting
on Bill's calendar was next to impossible.

20:47.748 --> 20:53.003
I felt a huge sense of pressure
to make things happen,

20:53.086 --> 20:54.671
and make them happen quickly.

20:55.214 --> 20:59.218
Otto and Seamus provided
a fantastic breakdown, very technical,

20:59.301 --> 21:02.012
what the Emotion Engine
did and did not do,

21:02.095 --> 21:04.765
which claims were true,
which claims were exaggerated,

21:05.599 --> 21:09.978
and at the end, they very audaciously
slipped in a little mention

21:10.062 --> 21:12.773
of the fact that, you know,
we could build a console too,

21:12.981 --> 21:15.192
and we put together
what we thought at the time

21:15.275 --> 21:16.735
was a pretty compelling argument.

21:18.570 --> 21:22.115
Gates had been curious about
the viability of a Microsoft console.

21:22.658 --> 21:26.537
But it wasn't until mid-March of 1999,
just one week

21:26.620 --> 21:30.749
after the formal announcement of the PS2,
that the possibility was finally

21:30.832 --> 21:32.918
starting to percolate
amongst the company's elite

21:33.001 --> 21:35.128
at its annual leadership retreat

21:35.337 --> 21:39.424
Semiahmoo was
Bill Gates's annual think week,

21:39.508 --> 21:41.134
to think about, strategically,

21:41.218 --> 21:44.179
what sort of projects
did they want to greenlight.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.682
One of the programs that you do
at this three-day offsite

21:46.765 --> 21:49.893
is an idea-generating effort.

21:49.977 --> 21:54.273
We all sat in a room and people
could propose a topic for a breakout.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.483
We would write down a question

21:56.567 --> 21:58.652
and we'd stand there
with our question in front of us.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.404
People moved around,

22:00.487 --> 22:03.532
and everybody voted
what topic they wanted to work on.

22:04.533 --> 22:08.745
And the question I wrote
that year was what if the cable companies,

22:08.829 --> 22:12.165
companies like AOL and Sony,
all got together

22:12.249 --> 22:15.919
and they all pooled all the subsidies that
they were paying to acquire customers.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.756
They could put out a box for free

22:19.840 --> 22:21.925
because it'd be so ubiquitous

22:22.009 --> 22:25.012
and so highly wanted, that's all I said.

22:25.095 --> 22:28.640
If they could get it
into the home as a game console,

22:28.724 --> 22:33.020
it would be like the comet that hit
the Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs,

22:33.103 --> 22:35.189
meaning the Windows PC.

22:37.316 --> 22:40.903
I got a big line of people
behind me on that one, including Bill,

22:40.986 --> 22:44.156
and off we went to start talking
about it for a couple of hours.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.617
And so we had a sort of a two-hour thrash

22:46.700 --> 22:50.954
on pros and cons of a video game console,
what was the state of play with Sony.

22:51.038 --> 22:53.081
And coming out of there
Gates just called it.

22:53.165 --> 22:56.877
He wanted me to look
into what we should do about it.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.921
Thompson's big question

22:59.004 --> 23:02.299
resonated with Gates, and
a call went out to the entire company

23:02.382 --> 23:04.134
looking for anyone who could answer.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.971
It was sort of an all-points bulletin
to senior managers

23:08.055 --> 23:09.139
all over the company saying,

23:09.223 --> 23:10.849
"Anybody working
on any of this kind of stuff?"

23:11.475 --> 23:17.606
And so, in March of '99, the DirectX team
and every other group in the company

23:17.689 --> 23:19.233
that touched games in any way,

23:19.316 --> 23:22.736
was brought together
for a meeting to talk about

23:22.819 --> 23:26.448
whether we should have a comprehensive
games strategy for the entire company.

23:26.532 --> 23:31.328
We took that opportunity to say, "Listen,
not only do we have a perspective on this,

23:31.411 --> 23:33.080
we actually have a presentation,

23:33.163 --> 23:36.500
a PowerPoint deck that we'd like to share
with everybody that says what we,

23:36.583 --> 23:38.418
the DirectX team,
think the company should do."

23:38.877 --> 23:42.631
And obviously that created a great stir
at the meeting, nobody was expecting that.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.342
But, it was
a great surprise to us to find out

23:45.425 --> 23:48.846
there were other parts of the company that
had aspirations of doing the same thing.

23:53.350 --> 23:57.980
I was running a team in what
was known as the Windows CE group.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.190
Windows CE was an operating system

24:00.274 --> 24:06.405
designed to run devices like
handheld computers or even game consoles,

24:06.488 --> 24:11.285
via a partnership we struck with Sega
around their last game console,

24:11.368 --> 24:12.870
which was the Dreamcast.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.581
We had a pretty capable hardware team.

24:15.664 --> 24:18.542
Some of the guys in that group
- had worked at 3
- DO.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.836
Have you experienced the awesome power

24:20.919 --> 24:22.921
- of the Panasonic REAL 3
- DO system?

24:23.005 --> 24:25.549
And that was a legitimate game console,
albeit one that,

24:25.632 --> 24:30.220
that was not a success in the marketplace,
but it was a legitimate console play.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.140
Together, we had the hardware expertise.

24:33.223 --> 24:37.519
And we had a proposal for what Microsoft
should do next in the console space.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.479
Obviously!

24:39.563 --> 24:42.024
These guys think they know
how to make a game console

24:42.107 --> 24:43.692
and that they should do it
instead of us.

24:43.775 --> 24:46.028
We opened the door and Bill's
interested in a game console,

24:46.111 --> 24:49.948
so now they're going to edge us out and
they're going to step through the door.

24:50.032 --> 24:53.577
They were funded, they had a name,
they had leadership, they had,

24:53.660 --> 24:55.162
executive support.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.080
Their argument was,
we already know how to do this,

24:57.164 --> 25:00.667
what do these kids know, go with us.

25:01.251 --> 25:05.964
The DirectX team was young and
hungry, full of tech know-how and vision.

25:06.215 --> 25:09.510
But Windows CE was
well known within the company,

25:09.593 --> 25:12.221
and had experience on their side.

25:12.304 --> 25:16.475
Suddenly it was a race to try to get
the most legitimacy inside of Microsoft,

25:18.644 --> 25:23.524
where the winner was going to be the one
to bring a game console to market.

25:23.607 --> 25:26.985
And it came to this big battle with Bill.

25:27.069 --> 25:30.948
It was what Microsoft often seemed to do,

25:31.031 --> 25:34.159
which is pit two groups
of smart people against each other.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.078
Classic Bill Gates move.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.748
The stage for the cage match was set.

25:39.831 --> 25:42.292
The DirectX and Windows CE teams

25:42.376 --> 25:45.212
would battle for the right
to make a Microsoft game console,

25:45.295 --> 25:47.130
in front of founder Bill Gates.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.301
To the victors belonged the spoils.

25:52.928 --> 25:56.515
Having Bill in the meeting
was always a fantastic thing

25:56.598 --> 25:59.685
as well as increasing
the tension at the same time.

25:59.768 --> 26:03.063
Somebody's confused.
Somebody's just not thinking.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.523
He was legendary.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.568
If you went in and you're full of [BLEEP],
you'd get shut down.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.403
No, you don't understand.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.989
You didn't, you didn't,
you guys never understood,

26:12.072 --> 26:14.658
you never understood
the first thing about this.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.119
So, you know we tried
really hard not to be full of

26:17.202 --> 26:18.412
He's brilliant.

26:18.495 --> 26:21.748
But it was a very aggressive,
male-dominated culture.

26:21.832 --> 26:23.000
Lots of expletives.

26:23.083 --> 26:27.671
Super, super smart, but man if you said
something stupid, uh...

26:27.754 --> 26:29.506
I'm done.

26:34.469 --> 26:36.471
Round 1!

26:36.555 --> 26:40.225
From my group's perspective, we felt good.

26:40.309 --> 26:42.811
We thought they didn't really understand
the console space,

26:42.895 --> 26:44.980
so frankly we discounted them
a little bit.

26:45.063 --> 26:47.107
Ready? Fight!

26:47.191 --> 26:51.028
We proposed something that aligned
very much with how business was done

26:51.111 --> 26:54.198
in the game console market as it existed.

26:56.158 --> 26:58.327
You gotta meet the market where it's at.

27:00.078 --> 27:04.333
The Win CE guys were sort
of like preaching the model,

27:04.416 --> 27:06.293
but the model isn't very interesting.

27:06.376 --> 27:09.338
In their pitch to Bill
as we're sitting there horrified,

27:09.421 --> 27:12.508
they're basically talking
- about recreating the 3
- DO,

27:12.591 --> 27:15.093
or making a game console similar
to everything else that's on the market.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.596
And we're like, "Ohhh...," you know?

27:17.679 --> 27:22.643
You don't enter a market and copy
what the competition does exactly.

27:22.726 --> 27:26.563
You enter a market to disrupt it.
To do stuff they can't do.

27:26.647 --> 27:32.277
Windows CE presented, and they talked
about this device, and blah blah blah,

27:32.361 --> 27:36.615
and then the DirectX team got up
and presented this vision for Xbox.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.325
There were two things in our plan

27:38.408 --> 27:42.663
that we thought absolutely critical
to the success of Xbox and games on Xbox,

27:42.746 --> 27:45.207
which had never been done before
on a game console.

27:45.707 --> 27:48.877
Number one, a hard drive,
that would be important

27:48.961 --> 27:51.839
not only to save information
about the player's state

27:51.922 --> 27:53.799
and what accomplishments they had done...

27:53.882 --> 27:55.133
Brutal!

27:55.217 --> 27:57.761
but also so they could store
large amounts of data somewhere,

27:57.845 --> 27:59.888
and be able to access
and change that over time.

27:59.972 --> 28:03.392
I remember there was a big debate about
should there be a hard drive in it?

28:05.018 --> 28:06.520
Or not a hard drive in it?

28:08.480 --> 28:11.984
We were the not-hard-drive folks,
we didn't see the benefit of it.

28:14.945 --> 28:16.572
The second component that we thought

28:16.655 --> 28:19.032
was absolutely critical was Ethernet.

28:19.116 --> 28:22.995
The Sega Dreamcast was basically
the first console in history

28:23.078 --> 28:25.289
to have any kind of online
component to it,

28:25.372 --> 28:28.083
but theirs was dial-up internet
using a modem.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.002
That was the technology at the time.

28:30.085 --> 28:32.713
We realized that that was
a short-term solution.

28:32.796 --> 28:35.132
What we wanted to do was
to point towards the future

28:35.215 --> 28:40.929
and integrate Ethernet and high-speed
broadband internet to the television set.

28:41.388 --> 28:44.516
We wanted to bet on the future
rather than on the present.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.352
The ability
to connect machines to each other

28:47.436 --> 28:51.481
and to the internet
was a core part of the DNA.

28:52.024 --> 28:55.527
We were pitching
a very traditional game console

28:55.861 --> 28:59.114
and the Xbox team proposal
as I understood it,

28:59.198 --> 29:02.451
it sounded to us like,
"Hey, we're gonna take a PC,

29:02.534 --> 29:04.912
and then we're gonna go build
a console out of that,"

29:04.995 --> 29:06.747
and it just didn't seem credible.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.540
It's just not the way the business worked.

29:08.624 --> 29:11.793
Final round. Fight!

29:13.003 --> 29:16.965
These two groups came
at the idea of building a game console

29:17.049 --> 29:19.134
in very, very different ways.

29:19.218 --> 29:21.470
So this meeting got really contentious.

29:22.638 --> 29:24.598
We'd have to watch these guys
like on our plan

29:24.681 --> 29:27.100
and tell us it's not gonna work
and talk to Bill

29:27.184 --> 29:28.810
about how game consoles really work.

29:28.894 --> 29:30.896
I'm waiting, I'm like,
"Come on Bill, kill 'em.

29:30.979 --> 29:33.232
Shut 'em down. They're full of [BLEEP]."
And he doesn't do it!

29:33.315 --> 29:35.901
I wanted to see the Bill Gates of old.

29:35.984 --> 29:38.070
I wanted to see Old Testament Bill Gates.

29:38.153 --> 29:41.031
The guy that was famous
for throwing people out of meetings

29:41.114 --> 29:42.699
and telling them never
to come back and telling them

29:42.783 --> 29:44.368
that they're
the dumbest person in the company.

29:44.451 --> 29:49.122
To my horror,
Bill sat back and stroked his chin

29:49.206 --> 29:51.792
and was very thoughtful.

29:51.875 --> 29:56.088
Bill said "Well, I think both teams
raise some good ideas."

29:56.672 --> 29:58.465
But he didn't seem really that impressed.

30:01.009 --> 30:03.971
In front of that audience we
realized we had to bring out every stop.

30:05.013 --> 30:09.601
The guys from the DirectX side knew
that you don't go to a Bill Gates review

30:09.685 --> 30:12.521
without showing something
really spectacular.

30:14.273 --> 30:18.068
And so leading into this meeting,
none of us had slept for like a week.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.028
We made this little device

30:20.112 --> 30:23.448
that had relatively old PC technology

30:23.532 --> 30:24.992
with a game console-like case on it,

30:25.909 --> 30:29.538
and we modified Windows
with a hack that like tears open a hole

30:29.621 --> 30:33.667
from the bottom up
and exposes the hardware.

30:33.750 --> 30:37.588
There was a bunch
of PC components and a game controller

30:37.671 --> 30:42.342
and, you know it was, literally just,
held together by chewing gum and tape.

30:42.426 --> 30:45.179
Soldering stuff, stripping wires

30:45.262 --> 30:47.931
and this was like, you know,
in the back of our car

30:48.015 --> 30:50.267
or like, you know, on the floor
in a conference room

30:50.350 --> 30:51.476
that we were making this stuff.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.314
An ugly timer on it that showed
Windows booting up from power.

30:55.397 --> 30:59.151
Booting a PC 20 years ago,
would take like three minutes.

30:59.234 --> 31:01.111
It could take longer,
it could take five, six, minutes.

31:01.195 --> 31:04.364
These guys played
with the PC, pulled stuff out

31:04.448 --> 31:06.408
that wasn't necessary, changed the BIOS.

31:06.825 --> 31:10.621
I turned it on and so it booted
in like three or four seconds.

31:11.830 --> 31:14.041
Bill Gates almost jumped across the table,

31:14.124 --> 31:15.209
he was so excited when he saw that.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.585
And Bill immediately looks around...

31:16.668 --> 31:19.254
"Why the doesn't Windows boot
like that all the time?"

31:19.421 --> 31:22.299
Yeah.
Bill wanted to see it multiple times.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.843
He's, like, "Turn it off and do it again.
Turn it off and do it again."

31:24.927 --> 31:26.929
I saw his jaw drop.

31:27.012 --> 31:30.432
This is a guy who knows
more than most people in the world

31:30.516 --> 31:32.893
will ever possibly know about PCs,

31:32.976 --> 31:37.231
saw a PC probably
for the first time come on immediately,

31:38.357 --> 31:41.818
and we had
a software emulator of a PlayStation

31:41.902 --> 31:43.153
that had been written for Windows.

31:43.237 --> 31:45.614
So you can imagine
the executives' surprise

31:45.697 --> 31:49.576
when we took a PlayStation disc,
stuck it in the Xbox prototype,

31:49.660 --> 31:53.539
and immediately <i>Tomb Raider</i>
came onscreen in all of its glory.

31:53.622 --> 31:56.583
It bridged the gap of believability.

31:56.667 --> 32:03.549
It made the idea of Xbox
seem tangible and real and achievable.

32:05.884 --> 32:11.265
The DirectX guys were stuntmen,
and they played the game a lot better.

32:11.348 --> 32:14.268
We, frankly, I think underestimated

32:14.351 --> 32:16.478
what they were gonna walk
into the room with.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.106
That meeting wasn't
a great outcome for us.

32:19.189 --> 32:21.441
The Windows CE guys literally said,

32:21.525 --> 32:24.194
"It's not fair, we weren't given
the opportunity to make hardware."

32:24.278 --> 32:25.612
And somebody said...

32:26.238 --> 32:27.447
Eliminate him!

32:27.531 --> 32:30.325
"Well nobody told them
to build hardware, but they did."

32:31.326 --> 32:33.328
Unfortunately for the Windows CE team,

32:33.412 --> 32:35.914
they brought a PowerPoint to a demo fight.

32:42.254 --> 32:46.133
Looking back on it now,
I really do think that Bill looked at us

32:46.216 --> 32:50.679
and saw some aspect of himself,
or the early days of Microsoft,

32:50.762 --> 32:52.181
and that's what he thought
was going to work.

32:53.432 --> 32:57.019
Bill's reaction was,
you guys are proposing

32:57.102 --> 32:58.937
that it's doing good things for Windows,

32:59.021 --> 33:00.397
and it's based on Windows,

33:00.480 --> 33:01.982
and we get Windows in the living room,

33:02.065 --> 33:03.317
that all makes sense.

33:04.109 --> 33:06.820
You're proposing
that we spend 500 million dollars on it,

33:08.155 --> 33:10.324
you need to make
this presentation to Steve.

33:10.407 --> 33:13.577
How much do you think this advanced
operating environment is worth?

33:13.660 --> 33:15.746
Wait just one minute before you answer!

33:16.371 --> 33:21.168
Steve is one of the most
enthusiastic and energetic people

33:21.251 --> 33:23.086
I have ever met in my life.

33:23.170 --> 33:28.800
That energy and enthusiasm
that you see on stage is 100% authentic.

33:29.343 --> 33:32.596
At the time, if the biggest
fan of Xbox was Bill Gates,

33:32.679 --> 33:35.140
the biggest opponent was Steve Ballmer.

33:35.224 --> 33:39.686
Steve, as a good businessman,
liked to make money.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.189
He liked, you know, big bold bets,

33:42.272 --> 33:45.400
but he liked big bold bets
that would pay off.

33:46.610 --> 33:49.446
This was right at the time
when Bill was transitioning

33:49.530 --> 33:51.323
the C.E.O. role to Steve.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.158
And they had already agreed
for a couple years

33:53.242 --> 33:54.868
that if Bill came up with some crazy idea

33:54.952 --> 33:57.120
that cost a lot of money
that Steve should get a chance

33:57.204 --> 33:58.747
to say yes or no on it first.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.083
And that led into this final meeting,

34:01.166 --> 34:05.420
where we really had quite a large group
of executives across the company.

34:07.256 --> 34:08.507
The room was packed,

34:08.590 --> 34:10.843
there were a lot
of different constituencies there,

34:10.926 --> 34:13.136
all the way from the field sales force,

34:13.220 --> 34:15.222
to the most technical side of the company.

34:15.347 --> 34:18.517
You had a lot of people
very, very interested.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.853
Steve's a big guy, and Bill's in there

34:21.061 --> 34:23.313
and you're in there
with these two super-famous guys

34:23.397 --> 34:27.442
who hold your destiny
and Steve is really upset

34:28.068 --> 34:30.237
that we wanted to take this risk.

34:30.571 --> 34:35.701
Ballmer understood very well
where Microsoft's bread was buttered

34:35.784 --> 34:37.703
and where the money came from.

34:37.786 --> 34:41.456
We were a company
known for productivity software.

34:41.707 --> 34:46.879
He didn't want some video game
or even the fact that we made video games,

34:46.962 --> 34:50.924
to threaten
the very lifeblood of the company.

34:52.217 --> 34:55.429
Steve looked
at the Xbox idea and saw insanity.

34:55.512 --> 34:58.640
He went to his whiteboard,
he said, "OK, what's this gonna cost?

34:58.724 --> 35:01.685
What's the hard drive gonna cost?
What's the Ethernet port gonna cost?

35:01.768 --> 35:03.187
What's the graphics chip gonna cost?"

35:03.270 --> 35:05.898
And he totaled it all up and said
"There's no way you guy--

35:05.981 --> 35:09.776
what's your reserve for returns?"
Reserve for returns? What does that mean?

35:10.903 --> 35:13.864
Well, we freely admitted
that we didn't understand

35:13.947 --> 35:15.365
the first thing about hardware,

35:15.449 --> 35:17.784
but we were gamers,
and we were game developers.

35:17.868 --> 35:21.288
Our entire careers
had been built around games.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.292
We knew that 3-D gaming was taking off,

35:25.375 --> 35:28.170
and online gaming
was just around the corner,

35:28.253 --> 35:31.215
and the best and brightest
in the game-development world,

35:31.298 --> 35:36.011
they were moving all their thinking
from the PC to consoles.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.931
We had the opportunity
to go create something

35:39.014 --> 35:41.308
that was going to take all of the equity,

35:41.391 --> 35:44.895
all the goodwill, all the technology
and all of the programming tools

35:44.978 --> 35:47.773
that had ever been created
to make Windows applications

35:47.856 --> 35:49.733
and carry it forward to the living room.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.819
And that was the product
that we were proposing, Xbox.

35:53.779 --> 35:58.742
Looking back at that moment,
what Steve and Bill were seeing

35:58.825 --> 36:02.829
was the future passing Microsoft by.

36:02.913 --> 36:07.000
You know Microsoft was thought of
as this dominant company of the era,

36:07.084 --> 36:10.504
but success or even survival
was anything but preordained.

36:10.587 --> 36:13.966
If Microsoft didn't grab this opportunity,

36:14.424 --> 36:19.012
that Microsoft would be on the wrong side
of the future of tech.

36:19.096 --> 36:23.851
It made everybody
step back a second and think.

36:23.934 --> 36:27.437
The console business was
something that we needed to seize.

36:27.646 --> 36:30.566
I think that that was where
Bill and Steve realized

36:30.649 --> 36:32.234
they needed to move forward with Xbox.

36:33.735 --> 36:36.029
An incredibly electrifying moment.

36:36.113 --> 36:38.740
We'd finally convinced Steve,
Bill was convinced.

36:38.824 --> 36:41.535
They've done an outstanding job
so far, haven't they?

36:41.618 --> 36:43.245
I think Bill did have a view that,

36:43.328 --> 36:45.873
software running on hardware
in a family room

36:45.956 --> 36:49.543
could really bring some unique
experiences into the home.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.670
We could start with video games

36:51.753 --> 36:53.046
but it could go
many directions from there.

36:53.755 --> 36:56.592
It was really an opportunity
to recapture the soul

36:56.675 --> 36:59.553
that Microsoft had at the beginning,

36:59.636 --> 37:02.097
to create that revolution,
to create that new platform.

37:02.514 --> 37:05.142
We were going to do something
no one else had done.

37:05.225 --> 37:08.061
We were going to launch a console
from a software company.

37:08.145 --> 37:10.105
Microsoft had done
nothing like that before.

37:10.189 --> 37:14.484
And then it became clear that there was
just some really big challenges for us.

37:14.568 --> 37:16.862
At the beginning it was about credibility.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.615
We had a task ahead of us to ensure

37:19.698 --> 37:22.451
that we were taken
seriously in the game industry.

37:22.534 --> 37:25.037
This equation of power,
performance, and price.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.040
You have to come correct
on every single part

37:28.123 --> 37:29.791
of that, you know, to be successful.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.919
There were so many tasks
that had to be done

37:32.002 --> 37:33.754
on both the hardware and software side.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.964
We realized that we needed
to have a leader.

37:36.048 --> 37:38.842
It was clear to all of us,
that that person was Rick Thompson.

37:39.009 --> 37:42.304
He had asked the best questions,
the most insightful questions.

37:42.387 --> 37:44.223
We wanted him to be part of the answers.

37:44.306 --> 37:49.102
So Rick was brought in
as the seasoned senior executive

37:49.186 --> 37:52.606
who had experience
in hardware with peripherals.

37:52.689 --> 37:53.732
Mice and keyboards.

37:53.815 --> 37:58.987
And he had to construct a plan
and a go-forward strategy.

37:59.238 --> 38:03.116
My comment at the time was
"I'm not big enough for this job."

38:03.200 --> 38:06.662
But, a couple days later, Steve Ballmer
calls me into his office and says,

38:06.745 --> 38:09.540
"Let's get this straight between
the two of us, this is your job now."

38:09.623 --> 38:12.292
You're making a big splash,
you say you're getting

38:12.376 --> 38:17.172
into this consumer market,
you know, if that doesn't work out well,

38:17.256 --> 38:21.301
it could really give
the company a huge black eye

38:21.885 --> 38:24.555
and that would be
very difficult to recover from.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.808
The risk here is enormous,

38:27.891 --> 38:29.601
with the amount of money
we could lose on this project.

38:29.685 --> 38:32.646
And for me it was fear,
uncertainty, and doubt.

38:32.729 --> 38:35.649
Because you got a business guy who's gonna
try to figure out a business model

38:35.732 --> 38:38.527
with my little team of people
who helped me with the hardware business.

38:38.610 --> 38:41.488
You got four people
coming over from DirectX.

38:41.572 --> 38:43.991
None of us actually knew the rules
of the game that we were playing.

38:44.074 --> 38:46.410
And we basically just stood there
and looked at each other and said,

38:46.493 --> 38:48.662
"Oh Like, now what do we do?"
