WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:06.672
Look at you boys.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.675
I can't believe
the school year's almost over.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.110
In fact, stand against the wall.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.678
I want to see
how much you've grown.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.847
You've never measured us before.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.483
Yeah, but the last family who
lived here measured their kids.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.851
Let's see how you
stack up against

00:18.853 --> 00:21.854
Howie, Jack, and Kimmy Pozlacek.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.455
What happened to Kimmy?

00:23.457 --> 00:26.058
At a certain point,
she just disappeared altogether.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.793
Did she go to college?

00:27.795 --> 00:29.128
She was so short.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.397
I'm so proud of you boys.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.967
Evan's finishing third grade,
Eddie seventh,

00:34.969 --> 00:37.136
and Emery's graduating
elementary school

00:37.138 --> 00:39.138
as the fifth-grade
valedictorian.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.906
He gets to give a speech.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.541
Okay, let's talk
graduation presents.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.410
What are you getting me?
Can I have Jordans?

00:44.412 --> 00:45.511
No, we're not getting you

00:45.513 --> 00:47.880
another pair
of basketball heels.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.402
We're getting you
something better.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.083
- Yes!
- Awesome!

00:51.085 --> 00:53.118
By Santa's beard!

00:54.922 --> 00:56.255
What?

00:56.257 --> 00:59.191
You are invited to
the Cattleman's Ranch

00:59.193 --> 01:03.429
Rib-Eye on the Future
Graduation Buffet Dinner,

01:03.431 --> 01:05.030
featuring
all-you-can-eat chicken.

01:05.032 --> 01:09.768
If it's Rib-Eye on the Future,
why are we having chicken?

01:09.770 --> 01:13.005
Because chicken
is the steak of the future.

01:13.007 --> 01:16.175
Wow.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.410

¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:19.880 --> 01:21.580
¶ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ¶

01:21.582 --> 01:23.582
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

01:23.584 --> 01:25.184
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:25.186 --> 01:27.352
¶ Homey, you don't know
where I come from ¶

01:27.354 --> 01:28.787
¶ But I know where I'm goin' ¶

01:28.789 --> 01:31.557
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

01:31.559 --> 01:33.959
So, our big graduation present

01:33.961 --> 01:38.130
is dinner at your restaurant,
which we eat at all the time?

01:38.132 --> 01:39.965
That's incredible!

01:39.967 --> 01:41.400
(chuckles)

01:41.402 --> 01:42.935
We'll go to your graduation,
then eat after.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.604
And you can each invite
one friend to bring with you.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.639
Great!
I'll invite my friend J.J.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.308
No. J.J.'s too chicken crazy.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.543
And he goes through napkins
like wildfire.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.544
Very well.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.446
Then I'll invite Mommy.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.716
Oh, I would love to go with you,
my angel.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.384
Good. That's one less mouth
to feed.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.487
My boo, Alison, is performing
at Emery's graduation

02:01.489 --> 02:03.055
with the Orlando
Youth Orchestra.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.623
We can give her a ride
to dinner.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.725
Great. So Eddie's bringing
his girlfriend.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.560
Girlfriend?! What girlfriend?

02:08.562 --> 02:11.597
Um... Alison?

02:11.599 --> 02:14.299
I've mentioned her
several times.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.268
I just said "my boo, Alison"?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.170
"Boo"?
That's the word of a ghost.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.672
Eddie, I had no idea
you had a girlfriend.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.509
In fact, I don't understand
most of what you say.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.843
Sho' nuff.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.145
What? I...

02:26.147 --> 02:27.980
Don't worry.
I met Alison at the Fall Ball.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.081
She's a great girl.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.682
Yeah, Mom. You'll love her.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.485
Really? Think about
how many people I love.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.188
Do the math.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.757
Have your brothers help you
do the math.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.666
(school bell rings)

02:47.668 --> 02:48.967
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.335
(gasps)
That's what I was saying!

02:50.337 --> 02:51.870
Hey, Alison. Hey, Nicole.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.372
- What's up?
- Just hanging out.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.507
Talking about something other
than a man.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.176
It's called the Bechdel test.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.810
We learned about it
when we were studying feminism.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.012
We'd tell you more,
but we'd fail.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.513
Cool, cool.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.714
So, Alison, my parents
are throwing a dinner

03:02.716 --> 03:03.882
after Emery's graduation,

03:03.884 --> 03:05.517
and they said
I could bring a date.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.153
Great! I'm so excited
to finally meet your mom.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.488
Oh, Mrs. Huang?

03:09.490 --> 03:10.956
You're gonna love her.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.591
I hung out with her
when I babysat Eddie.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.993
We were more like
co-babysitters.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.963
No, she paid me to watch you.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.298
Later.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.366
Don't be nervous.
Parents love me...

03:21.368 --> 03:23.368
My mom wants me to date
a Chinese girl.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.737
What? She said that?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.739
She's been saying that
for a long time.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.909
If we talk to our baby, he'll
learn the sound of our voices.

03:30.911 --> 03:34.379
Hey, little baby,
this is your bàba.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.647
(doorbell rings)

03:35.649 --> 03:37.149
Uh, that must be
your buffalo wings.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.650
Be right there!

03:40.588 --> 03:44.356
Baby, this is your mother.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.092
You're going to date
a Chinese girl.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.860
I thought
she'd gotten over that,

03:48.862 --> 03:51.330
but I guess she didn't
understand we were dating.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.031
How can she not understand?

03:53.033 --> 03:54.533
I don't know!

03:54.535 --> 03:56.835
I said you were my boo,
my fly girl, my fine shorty.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.571
I don't know how much clearer
I could have been.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.373
So, is she gonna hate me?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.708
(sucks in air)

04:02.710 --> 04:04.176
I really would love
to say no here.

04:04.178 --> 04:07.512
(scoffs) Well, maybe
it won't be<i> that</i> bad.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.282
I mean, once she meets you at the
dinner, I'll bet... No. No way.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.351
Now that I know this,
I can't meet your mom

04:12.353 --> 04:14.119
for the first time
at a graduation dinner.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.387
It's too much pressure.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.623
What if I set up a casual hang
at my place?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.958
Then you can meet her
in a controlled setting!

04:19.960 --> 04:22.194
Yeah, that's good.
I'll bring her a lemon cake.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.895
Everybody loves lemon cake,
right?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.365
(sucks in air) I don't.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.899
I wouldn't.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.668
Mnh-mnh.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.304
(door opens, closes)

04:32.306 --> 04:34.606
There he is, Mr. Valedictorian.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.742
How's your big speech coming?

04:36.744 --> 04:39.044
Great. I thought I'd thank
all the people at school

04:39.046 --> 04:40.279
for being so nice.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.047
I have a question for you.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.416
If Lincoln gave
the Gettysburg Address

04:44.418 --> 04:46.551
and just said things
were "nice,"

04:46.553 --> 04:48.453
do you think
we'd still have slavery?

04:48.455 --> 04:50.055
What?

04:50.057 --> 04:53.125
Speeches have the ability
to effect real change.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.426
Lincoln knew that.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.061
Guess who else knows that.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.096
- Diane Keaton?
- Me.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.499
I am known for
my inspirational speeches.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.967
So let's go out there

05:01.969 --> 05:04.336
and let's win one
for Charlie Sheen's brother!

05:04.338 --> 05:07.839
Ladies, if we build it,
they will come!

05:07.841 --> 05:09.241
(all cheering)

05:09.243 --> 05:11.910
As we approach
Eddie's third birthday,

05:11.912 --> 05:14.646
we should get him
the greatest gift of all...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.415
A human sibling.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.450
JESSICA: Oh, yeah,
I forgot to tell you.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.584
I'm already pregnant.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.420
Wh...

05:21.422 --> 05:24.089
There is great power
in public speaking,

05:24.091 --> 05:26.258
if you know how to harness it.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.592
Can you teach me?

05:27.594 --> 05:28.794
I'd be honored.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.496
But I'm busy.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.198
Of course I will! See?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.634
In two sentences, I made you
feel three feelings...

05:35.636 --> 05:37.102
Disappointment and elation.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.437
What's the third feeling?

05:38.439 --> 05:39.871
Curiosity.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.744
¶¶

05:51.985 --> 05:53.225
What do you mean?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.125
I don't have a suit.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.160
I have two blazers,
three khakis,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.296
and six shirts
that I mix and match

06:04.298 --> 06:06.658
to create 36 different looks.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.136
Isn't a suit complicated
to make?

06:11.138 --> 06:12.904
(chuckles)

06:18.045 --> 06:19.277
Hmm.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.681
I wanted to play video games,

06:22.683 --> 06:25.016
but Alison insisted
we have a study date.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.919
I guess being with Alison
just makes me a better student.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.421
Does she do C.L.C.?

06:29.423 --> 06:31.256
Uh, no.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.425
Hmm.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.494
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.497
Can I talk to you for a second?

06:40.934 --> 06:44.336
(sighs) Try not to be too judgmental
about Eddie's girlfriend.

06:44.338 --> 06:45.937
I know you want him
to date a Chinese girl,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.072
but this is Florida.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.314
His options are limited.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.611
Well, then he should wait
until he goes to college.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.780
He could find a Chinese girl
at Northwestern.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.782
Georgia Tech.

06:56.784 --> 06:57.783
(doorbell rings)

06:57.785 --> 07:00.185
Oh! Right on time.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.355
That's another thing
about Alison... so punctual.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.261
Um...

07:10.397 --> 07:13.465
Oh, hi!
You must be Mr. and Mrs. Huang.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.002
I'm Alison.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.236
Eddie, you didn't tell me
your girlfriend was Chinese.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.472
Oh!

07:20.474 --> 07:24.309
I almost lost my balance
from joy.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.286
Hi. Um, have we met before?
Because I thought...

07:34.288 --> 07:36.221
Oh, yes.
We met at the Fall Ball.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.156
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Huang.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.624
Please, please. Come in.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.128
Louis, you didn't tell me
Alison was Chinese.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.464
This is the only surprise
you've ever given me

07:45.466 --> 07:46.531
that I have liked.

07:46.533 --> 07:51.136
I'd like to present you with
a traditional gift of oranges.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.971
I buy them wholesale.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.639
(whispering) Yes.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.808
Eddie, shut the door.
Shut the door.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.010
Shut the door! Shut the door!

08:01.114 --> 08:03.674
(normal voice) I'll just
put these in the kitchen.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.485
Who are you?

08:06.487 --> 08:08.687
- Are you Eddie?
- Yes.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.189
I'm Audrey, Alison's friend
from Youth Orchestra.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.158
Call her.
She'll explain everything.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.828
Alison, I have so many questions
for you.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.830
Where do you live?
Where is your family from?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.533
Well, uh, we live
near Thornton Park,

08:21.535 --> 08:23.568
which is right over by...

08:25.172 --> 08:28.006
Um, are you crying?

08:28.008 --> 08:31.376
I've been waiting for you.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.012
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.982
(telephone rings)

08:36.984 --> 08:38.517
I'm sorry!

08:38.519 --> 08:40.385
Why is there a Chinese girl here
saying she's you?

08:40.387 --> 08:41.887
I freaked out.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.722
All that talk about your mom
got in my head,

08:43.724 --> 08:45.390
so I sent my friend Audrey.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.526
She plays second-chair piccolo
in orchestra with me.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.895
Eddie, get off the phone!
You're being rude!

08:49.897 --> 08:51.730
And lose the bowls on the table.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.632
I'm gonna put out
the good chips.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.967
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
This is crazy!

08:55.969 --> 08:58.303
No, you can't!
She'll hate me even more!

08:58.305 --> 08:59.905
Well, what was your plan?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.806
I didn't have one! I panicked!

09:01.808 --> 09:06.144
Hey, Eddie. Uh, Alison
wanted to talk to you.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.046
That's not Alison. Whew.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.548
I didn't want to say anything.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.583
I'm usually great with faces.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.851
Me, too.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.052
Do you use the Eyes-Mouth Method

09:14.054 --> 09:15.420
or the Most Prominent Feature?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.489
Both of you,
shut your eyes-mouth.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.690
No one cares.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.692
Is that Audrey? Say hi for me.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.928
(sighs) Alison says hi.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.829
Tell her, "Hi, Al."

09:24.831 --> 09:27.232
Your mom wanted me to tell you
to come join us in the kitchen.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.435
She's gonna make dumplings while
I quiz you with flashcards.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.338
I have to go deal with this.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.340
Okay, but promise me
you won't say anything.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.409
We'll figure something out
tomorrow at school.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.411
Fine.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.846
So, quick quesh...

09:41.848 --> 09:43.081
That's not Alison.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.449
She panicked
and sent her friend Audrey.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.785
(chuckles) I knew it wasn't her.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.888
I'm good with faces.
I use the Mouth-Chin Method.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.590
(sighs)

09:56.964 --> 09:59.097
Perfect? Look at this sleeve.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.600
Can we move some of this
over here?

10:03.470 --> 10:06.204
That's not even a real ruler.
That's Bubble Tape.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.810
(school bell rings)

10:11.812 --> 10:15.113
Well, I hope you're happy.
My mom loves you.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.548
She does?!

10:16.550 --> 10:18.650
Oh. Right. That's not good.

10:18.652 --> 10:23.054
Having a Chinese girl come to
my house and pretend she's you?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.823
This is untenable, dawg!

10:24.825 --> 10:26.057
"Untenable"?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.892
I learned it
from Audrey's flashcards.

10:27.894 --> 10:28.893
It was a long night.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.328
I'm sorry.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.330
I just really wanted your mom
to like me.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.766
I get it.
But we have to come clean.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.769
Come over tonight.
We'll tell my mom it was a joke.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.971
I'll introduce you,
pop in a movie,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.773
and boom... Problem solved.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.109
A movie?
How is that gonna fix anything?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.777
My mom's a huge Denzel fan.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.179
I was saving "Malcolm X" for
when I did something really bad,

10:48.181 --> 10:49.948
like turn our van
into a low-rider.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.516
But these are desperate times.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.089
And now, your valedictorian,

10:58.091 --> 11:00.191
Emery... Emery...
Emery... Emery...

11:00.193 --> 11:02.794
Huang... Huang...
Huang... Huang.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.696
(imitates crowd cheering)

11:07.134 --> 11:08.433
That's your cue.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.469
Oh. Great. Wait.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.539
Where are your visual aids?
Your charts? Your props?

11:14.541 --> 11:16.341
- I don't have any.
- (sighs)

11:16.343 --> 11:18.877
Emery, you don't just speak
to people's ears.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.311
You speak to their eyes.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.714
Give me your speech.
I'll show you how it's done.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.182
(clears throat)

11:24.184 --> 11:27.318
"Good afternoon,
Palms Elementary School."

11:27.320 --> 11:29.554
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.089
Dad, that's my speech!

11:32.626 --> 11:34.192
Dad!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.530
I had prepared some remarks,

11:38.532 --> 11:42.400
but instead, I'm going to speak
from the heart.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.970
And then the real speech
is on your hand.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.306
Ohh.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.308
- That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.777
And you swapped out my speech
with the pages you ripped up.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.080
Right?

11:55.916 --> 11:58.076
Hey, what's that alien's name?

12:03.590 --> 12:04.856
You ready?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
I'm ready.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.093
Hello, Mother.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.761
- Funny story.
- Eddie!

12:09.763 --> 12:12.597
Hi. Your mom called
and invited me to play mahjong.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.399
She insisted that I come over.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.700
Insisted.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.169
I love this girlfriend of yours,
Eddie.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.505
She never feeds Grandma
any good tiles.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.673
(chuckles)

12:27.581 --> 12:29.347
Who's this?

12:29.349 --> 12:30.849
Hi. I'm, uh...

12:30.851 --> 12:33.251
She's, uh, selling
Girl Scout cookies.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.252
Cookies? Cookies?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.754
Nope, we're all good.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.757
Thanks, stranger!
See yourself out! Bye-bye!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.860
Eddie!

12:41.862 --> 12:45.363
You didn't ask Alison
if she wanted cookies.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.564
Alison?

12:46.566 --> 12:49.067
Do you have anything lemon?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.269
(gasps) I love lemon.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.544
(knock on door)

12:59.546 --> 13:01.112
Hi, Eddie.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.314
Change your mind
about those Thin Mints?

13:03.316 --> 13:05.884
I'm sorry. I just...
My mom looked so happy.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.052
I don't know. I just panicked.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.888
- Where's Audrey?
- Still at my house.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.589
I said I had to
go to the bathroom,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.224
turned on the water,
and crawled out the window.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.559
(water running)

13:14.561 --> 13:15.894
Eddie, hurry up!

13:15.896 --> 13:18.496
Are you in line
for the bathroom?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.165
Yeah. I like waiting in line.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.333
It's like being
in a really slow parade.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.936
You know what I hate?
Line cutters.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.304
You know who they're
really cutting?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.806
- Themselves.
- Themselves.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.174
EVAN: Come on!
(knocking on door)

13:29.176 --> 13:31.075
(whimpering)

13:33.180 --> 13:35.847
Your mom's so happy with Audrey.
I'd just be a disappointment.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.683
I guess tomorrow
at your brother's graduation,

13:38.685 --> 13:41.352
we just pretend
we don't know each other.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.755
Yeah, I guess.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.291
Well, I better get going.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.453
If the water bill's too high,
we all get grounded.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.364
¶¶

13:56.436 --> 13:58.303
What a crowd.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.745
I don't know which I like more,
the pomp or the circumstance.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.645
Alison!

14:07.647 --> 14:09.547
Alison!

14:09.549 --> 14:12.784
(sighs) We need to get your
girlfriend some pork bone stew,

14:12.786 --> 14:13.785
help her hearing.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.053
Alison!

14:15.055 --> 14:16.788
Hey.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.864
Hi, Eddie.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.031
Hi, Reba.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.967
I heard about your dating mess.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.635
It's the talk of the band.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.804
Sounds like the whole thing's
FUBAR.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.506
Fudged Up Beyond All Reba.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.475
Have a nice summer.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.077
You, too.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.579
Hopefully when I get back,
you'll have realized...

14:41.581 --> 14:44.849
¶ Those girls are poison ¶

14:44.851 --> 14:47.685
¶ Never trust a big butt
and a smile ¶

14:47.687 --> 14:49.520
Poison.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.422
Poison.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.225
Reba.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.061
Why aren't you wearing
your new suit?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.429
Good question.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.165
Why aren't I wearing
my new suit, Grandma?

15:04.504 --> 15:11.776
Welcome to the Palms Elementary
School class of 1996 graduation!

15:11.778 --> 15:14.112
(applause)

15:14.114 --> 15:16.915
And before we begin,
a quick announcement.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.684
Uh, Billy Sanders,
I've just been informed

15:19.686 --> 15:23.955
that you got a "D"
on your last art project, so...

15:30.196 --> 15:32.130
You let us down, Billy!

15:32.132 --> 15:34.899
(door closes) Okay!

15:34.901 --> 15:41.239
Please give a warm welcome to
your valedictorian, Emery Huang!

15:41.241 --> 15:44.042
Yeah, that's my boy! (Laughs)

15:44.044 --> 15:45.777
(applause)

15:45.779 --> 15:47.045
Good afternoon.

15:48.715 --> 15:54.018
Fourscore
and three semesters ago...

15:55.622 --> 15:58.323
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.791
(audience murmuring)

15:59.793 --> 16:01.225
He's doing it.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.660
I'd prepared a speech,

16:02.662 --> 16:05.496
but instead I wanted
to speak from the heart.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.832
So, I'd like to take
a few moments

16:07.834 --> 16:09.467
to recognize the people

16:09.469 --> 16:12.570
who helped me become
the person I am... my family.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.907
My dad for giving me
the confidence

16:15.909 --> 16:17.175
to come out of my shell.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.344
My grandma.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.849
(chuckles)

16:24.851 --> 16:26.651
And my little brother, Evan,

16:26.653 --> 16:29.587
for teaching me that class
comes in all sizes.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.855
(gasps)

16:30.857 --> 16:32.790
He said my name
in the microphone.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.258
I'm famous!

16:34.260 --> 16:36.427
And my mom for always
wanting what's best

16:36.429 --> 16:38.763
for me and my brothers.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.198
And my brother Eddie

16:40.200 --> 16:42.500
for being honest
and always speaking his mind.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.205
And thank you to everyone else
who supported me.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.974
You've all been real, real nice.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.476
(applause)

16:51.478 --> 16:52.910
(sighs)

16:54.314 --> 16:56.634
- That's not my girlfriend!
- I don't like your girlfriend!

16:56.716 --> 17:00.885
And now a medley
by the Orlando Youth Orchestra.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.388
(orchestra playing)

17:03.390 --> 17:05.356
Wait. I thought you loved
my girlfriend.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.791
She's perfect.

17:06.793 --> 17:10.728
I just didn't realize
how boring that would be.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.063
She's like tofu.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.532
She absorbs flavor.
Got none of her own.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.403
You need someone
with more personality, Eddie.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.304
Like you.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.572
I'm confused.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.741
She's not your girlfriend?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.476
No. The real Alison freaked out

17:25.478 --> 17:27.812
when I told her you wanted me
to date a Chinese girl.

17:27.814 --> 17:31.582
I suppose you don't<i> have to</i>
date someone who is Chinese.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.653
She just has to act Chinese
in here.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.191
So, if the girl I met isn't
your girlfriend, then who is?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.093
The one playing 2Pac
on the piccolo.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.896
("California Love" playing)

17:48.435 --> 17:50.902
First-chair piccolo.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.575
Whoo! (Applause)

17:59.913 --> 18:04.182
And now I'd like to introduce
our next valedictorian,

18:04.184 --> 18:05.917
Chica Cohen.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.518
(applause)

18:07.520 --> 18:09.454
Next valedictorian?

18:09.456 --> 18:11.789
At our school,
everyone is valedictorian

18:11.791 --> 18:13.624
so they don't feel left out.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.526
They're pal-edictorians.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.597
Hi, Mom!

18:19.599 --> 18:21.699
Oh, oh, that's...
That's the light, dear.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.201
Oh, okay.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.770
Hi, Mom! It's me... Chica!

18:25.772 --> 18:28.473
¶ California ¶

18:28.475 --> 18:31.075
¶ Knows how to party ¶

18:31.077 --> 18:34.145
¶ California
knows how to party ¶

18:34.147 --> 18:36.481
So, in order to make
a good first impression,

18:36.483 --> 18:38.649
you used a Chinese double...
Very clever.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.385
It's exactly what I would have done.
Thank you.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.454
So, how did you get so good
at piccolo?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.622
Practice.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.257
To be honest, I started playing

18:46.259 --> 18:48.659
because there are a lot of
unclaimed piccolo scholarships.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.228
Yes.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.497
Mom, are you ever gonna
let me talk to Alison?

18:52.499 --> 18:55.066
Be a gentleman and go get us
some more chicken.

18:55.068 --> 18:58.769
You have to start
training them young.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.505
Okay.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.341
Eddie, I'm gonna need you
to take it easy on the thighs.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.583
We're running low.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.150
I'm sorry, but the good food
is for graduates only.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.421
Thanks for everything, Dad.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.090
Your "tearing up the speech"
trick worked.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.691
No, it didn't.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.760
I could tell you weren't reading
the speech off your hands.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.629
I'm sorry.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.597
In the moment, everything I'd
written just didn't feel right.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.166
I had to use my own words.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.134
An off-the-cuff
emotional speech?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.769
Even Lincoln
had to write his down.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.204
You're a natural.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.973
Hmm. Maybe one day
you could teach me something.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.275
I'd be honored.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.443
But I'm busy.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.380
- See what I did there?
- I like what you did.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.449
Hi, Emery.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.351
Thanks for inviting me
to be your date.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.653
Thanks for saying yes.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.655
We have so many
shared interests.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.956
Is that chicken?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.567
Jessica.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.470
She's really going to town
on those thighs.

20:09.342 --> 20:13.811
Why can't Emery find a nice
girlfriend, like Eddie did?

20:18.184 --> 20:20.218
Grandma? What's going on?

20:20.220 --> 20:22.300
(Frank Sinatra's
"Come Fly With Me" plays)

20:23.223 --> 20:25.256
¶ Come fly with me ¶

20:25.258 --> 20:29.126
¶ Let's fly, let's fly away ¶

20:30.029 --> 20:33.931
¶ If you can use
some exotic booze ¶

20:33.933 --> 20:37.235
¶ There's a bar in far Bombay ¶

20:37.237 --> 20:39.070
¶ Come fly with me ¶

20:39.072 --> 20:43.007
¶ Let's fly, let's fly away ¶

20:43.009 --> 20:46.410
M'Mommy, shall we hit
the buffet?

20:46.412 --> 20:48.179
Nice suit.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.815
¶¶

20:58.124 --> 21:00.925
I can't believe
I've never seen "Malcolm X."

21:00.927 --> 21:02.927
You know,
in ancient Roman times,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.062
his name
would have been Malcolm 10.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.565
Denzel looks good in glasses.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.934
Is there a Mrs. X?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.135
Yeah. Betty Shabazz.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.870
She went on
to become an educator

21:12.872 --> 21:14.071
and civil rights leader.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.640
Oh.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.142
Malcolm X
sure can give a speech.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.712
Malcolm X wasn't afraid
to bring the hammer down

21:21.714 --> 21:24.081
when he saw a great injustice.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.317
Which brings me
to the water bill.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.251
(gasps)

21:27.253 --> 21:28.619
- Go! Run!
- Go, go!

21:28.621 --> 21:30.955
So, I was looking at it...
