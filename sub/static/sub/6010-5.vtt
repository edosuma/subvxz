00:50.542 --> 00:53.742
The pains have stopped. Nothing will
happen yet.

01:02.182 --> 01:04.641
Everything is fine.

01:04.677 --> 01:07.067
You mean it was a false alarm? Not
exactly.

01:07.102 --> 01:10.662
These early labour pains show that
the womb is preparing itself for birth.

01:10.697 --> 01:14.262
Dr Clarkson, I'm afraid Lord Grantham
doesn't enjoy medical detail.

01:14.297 --> 01:16.342
The point is, can we all go back to
bed?

01:16.377 --> 01:17.827
You can.

01:17.862 --> 01:19.987
And so can I. I'll see you out.

01:20.022 --> 01:22.862
Sir Philip Tapsell will be here
tomorrow. Of course.

01:23.662 --> 01:25.622
If you think it advisable.

01:27.982 --> 01:30.502
There really is nothing wrong?
Nothing at all.

01:31.502 --> 01:35.142
She a healthy young woman going through
a very normal and natural process.

01:36.462 --> 01:39.262
I think I'd rather be in the city if
I were having a baby.

01:39.297 --> 01:41.507
Where they've got all the modern
inventions.

01:41.542 --> 01:44.502
Far away from everyone you know and
trust? I don't think I would.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.947
What are you talking about having
babies for, Ivy?

01:46.982 --> 01:49.782
I think we can leave that for a
little further down the menu.

01:49.817 --> 01:51.827
It's always an idea to be prepared.

01:51.862 --> 01:55.782
I expect you're always prepared? I
try to be, Mr Barrow.

01:55.817 --> 01:59.702
I don't like the direction this
conversation is taking.

01:59.737 --> 02:02.787
Could we all begin the day's tasks,
please?

02:02.822 --> 02:08.222
And remember - Lady Sybil is in a delicate
condition, so no noise on the gallery.

02:09.301 --> 02:12.747
It's exciting, though, in't it, to
have a baby in the house.

02:12.782 --> 02:14.702
It won't make much difference to you.

02:14.703 --> 02:16.622
Now get back in the kitchen,
and do as you're told!

02:17.702 --> 02:19.822
Well, I think that message got
through.

02:22.862 --> 02:26.422
We can't risk her welfare to soothe
Clarkson's feelings.

02:26.457 --> 02:29.982
I know. I like the old boy, but he
did misdiagnose Matthew,

02:30.017 --> 02:33.022
and he did miss the warning signs
with Lavinia.

02:33.057 --> 02:35.062
Thank you, O'Brien.

02:35.097 --> 02:36.707
Is that fair?

02:36.742 --> 02:40.262
He didn't wanna get Matthew's hopes up
when it wouldn't make any difference.

02:40.297 --> 02:42.582
With Lavinia, the disease moved like
lightning.

02:42.617 --> 02:45.667
I know, I know. But even so...

02:45.702 --> 02:50.022
Sir Philip Tapsell may have delivered
many lords and royal highnesses,

02:50.057 --> 02:52.107
but he doesn't know US.

02:52.142 --> 02:56.142
I'll ask him to include Clarkson in his
deliberations. Will that satisfy you?

02:56.177 --> 02:58.102
I suppose so.

03:01.262 --> 03:05.267
You look a bit puzzled. I am. Mr
Carson's asked me to wind the clocks.

03:05.302 --> 03:07.782
You must be doing well.
In this house, that marks

03:07.783 --> 03:10.262
you out as First Footman
more than anything could.

03:10.297 --> 03:14.822
That's just it. I said thank you right
away, but I know nothing about clocks.

03:14.857 --> 03:17.742
You'd better ask Mr Barrow. He's the
clock expert.

03:17.777 --> 03:19.899
He used to wind them, but of course

03:19.934 --> 03:22.022
it's quite wrong for a valet to do
it.

03:22.057 --> 03:24.267
Mr Barrow won't mind? Oh, no.

03:24.302 --> 03:28.502
I can see he likes you, and that's good,
since he's got the ear of His Lordship.

03:28.537 --> 03:30.867
Yes, I suppose he would have.

03:30.902 --> 03:34.182
I'd keep in with him if I were you.
I will.

03:34.217 --> 03:36.142
Thank you. Think nothing of it.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.502
I'm the size of a house.

03:45.662 --> 03:47.667
My back hurts,

03:47.702 --> 03:49.662
my ankles are swelling,

03:49.942 --> 03:51.827
and my head aches.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.107
Honestly, I cannot recommend this to
anyone.

03:54.142 --> 03:57.382
I am listening, but of course I'm
dying to start one of my own.

03:59.222 --> 04:02.702
So, you're not waiting? Waiting for
what?

04:02.737 --> 04:05.462
I don't know, but I did wonder.

04:08.142 --> 04:11.022
Mary, you know what I said about the
baby being Catholic?

04:11.057 --> 04:13.902
I've just realised that the
christening will have to be here.

04:13.937 --> 04:15.319
In Downton.

04:15.354 --> 04:16.666
Blimey.

04:16.702 --> 04:18.902
I wanted the whole thing done in
Dublin.

04:18.937 --> 04:20.862
Out of sight, out of mind.

04:22.382 --> 04:24.427
But we can't wait forever.

04:24.462 --> 04:26.787
We can't not christen it, the poor
thing.

04:26.822 --> 04:30.302
You don't have to do this. It's your
baby too.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.347
I don't mind.

04:32.382 --> 04:38.942
I mean, I do believe in God, but all
the rest of it - vicars, feast days,

04:38.977 --> 04:42.422
and deadly sins - I don't care about
all of that.

04:43.662 --> 04:46.662
I don't know if a vicar knows any
more about God than I do.

04:48.102 --> 04:52.382
And I love Tom so very, very much.

04:55.822 --> 04:57.782
I'll let you rest.

04:59.502 --> 05:03.182
And don't worry. I'll fight your
corner with Travis if it comes to it.

05:11.462 --> 05:14.702
There. You feel a slight increase in
the resistance?

05:14.737 --> 05:17.347
I think so. That's what you're
watching for.

05:17.382 --> 05:20.502
Never go past the point where the
clock is comfortable.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.587
You make it sound like a living
thing.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.342
Clocks are living things. My dad was
a clockmaker.

05:25.377 --> 05:27.467
I grew up with clocks. I understand
them.

05:27.502 --> 05:30.462
Never wind them in the early morning
before a room has warmed up,

05:30.497 --> 05:32.919
nor too late, when the night air
cools them down.

05:32.954 --> 05:35.342
Find the time when the family's out
of the room.

05:40.862 --> 05:45.387
But I don't understand. Why
was I kept away from you until now?

05:45.422 --> 05:50.102
Whatever the reason, it's over. The point
is someone has to question Mrs Bartlett.

05:50.137 --> 05:53.822
You wrote and said she saw Vera on
the evening of the day of her death.

05:53.857 --> 05:55.747
That's right.

05:55.782 --> 05:58.682
She went for a walk. The door was
open, and she went in.

05:58.717 --> 06:01.547
She saw Vera was cutting pastry from
under her nails.

06:01.582 --> 06:04.747
I wrote that because it was such a
strange detail for her to remember.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.902
She was making the pie that she ate that

06:06.903 --> 06:09.022
night when I was on the
train back to Downton.

06:14.062 --> 06:16.067
So, Vera planned this?

06:16.102 --> 06:19.822
She meant for you to be imprisoned,
and hanged for her suicide?

06:19.857 --> 06:21.627
It was her revenge.

06:21.662 --> 06:24.662
And what a revenge, for both of us.

06:27.382 --> 06:29.387
But they'll say you poisoned the
milk,

06:29.422 --> 06:32.587
or the flour or something to catch
her after you'd gone.

06:32.622 --> 06:34.882
They tested everything in the kitchen.

06:34.883 --> 06:37.142
They said it was in the pastry,
where I couldn't have put it.

06:40.982 --> 06:42.982
Oh, I hope she's burning in hell!

06:43.017 --> 06:44.982
Don't go down that road.

06:45.982 --> 06:47.982
Once you do, there's no way off it.

06:53.142 --> 06:56.382
I've been thinking about you since
we last met,

06:56.417 --> 06:58.782
and wanted to know how you were
living.

06:58.817 --> 07:00.827
I've not gone back to...

07:00.862 --> 07:03.987
..doing what I was doing, if that's
worrying you.

07:04.022 --> 07:07.142
I've no Charlie to feed, so now if I
starve, I starve alone.

07:08.342 --> 07:10.427
I'd rather starve than do that.

07:10.462 --> 07:14.782
You see...I thought you might work
here for a while.

07:14.817 --> 07:16.827
Helping Mrs Bird.

07:16.862 --> 07:20.702
It would mean that when you moved on
you will have had a respectable job

07:20.737 --> 07:22.907
with a respectable reference.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.547
Are you sure you've thought about
this, ma'am?

07:25.582 --> 07:28.702
What will Mrs Hughes' reaction be, or
Lady Grantham's?

07:28.737 --> 07:30.707
And old Lady Grantham?

07:30.742 --> 07:33.342
I can't wait to hear what she has to
say about it.

07:33.377 --> 07:35.302
Don't you want to come?

07:36.142 --> 07:38.227
It's not that, ma'am.

07:38.262 --> 07:42.062
You're offering a return to a wholesome
world, and I am very, very grateful.

07:42.097 --> 07:43.627
Well, then?

07:43.662 --> 07:47.302
But I think it's going to be a lot
more complicated than you allow.

07:47.337 --> 07:50.942
Then we shall have to face those
complications together, shan't we?

07:55.982 --> 07:57.982
I'll take him from here. Sir.

07:58.822 --> 08:00.867
Bates seems very cheerful. Is he?

08:00.902 --> 08:05.182
He has a visit from his wife earlier.
She must have brought him some good news.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.187
It hardly seems fair, does it?

08:07.222 --> 08:10.307
You've got an extra year, and I've
got a formal reprimand,

08:10.342 --> 08:12.622
and Mr Bates, who's done it all, who's

08:12.623 --> 08:14.902
made all the trouble
for us, gets good news.

08:14.937 --> 08:16.907
What do you think it is?

08:16.942 --> 08:19.542
She can't be pregnant. He was
arrested a year ago.

08:19.577 --> 08:22.142
She might be, but he wouldn't be very
happy about it.

08:22.782 --> 08:24.742
So, what do you wanna do? Um...

08:25.502 --> 08:30.142
It'll need some thought. First, what
does this good news consist of?

08:31.022 --> 08:34.022
When you shared with him, where did
he keep his letters?

08:38.022 --> 08:40.381
Quite a few of the cottages have
been renovated.

08:40.417 --> 08:42.621
Thanks to you. Maybe a little thanks
to me.

08:43.662 --> 08:47.382
But many of the farms have been left
entirely to their own devices.

08:47.417 --> 08:50.462
Coulter hasn't farmed this properly
for 20 years.

08:51.582 --> 08:54.462
He struggles to pay the rent, which
is too low anyway.

08:55.262 --> 08:57.222
There's been no...investment.

08:58.502 --> 09:01.662
Papa would say you can't abandon
people just because they grow old.

09:01.697 --> 09:04.382
I agree, but it would be cheaper to
give him a free cottage,

09:04.417 --> 09:06.707
and work this land as it should be
worked.

09:06.742 --> 09:10.267
I see. And you don't think Papa
understands that?

09:10.302 --> 09:13.102
Maybe he harks back to a time when
money was abundant.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.347
There wasn't much need to keep on
top of it.

09:15.382 --> 09:18.462
I think he equates being
business-like with being mean.

09:18.497 --> 09:20.942
Or worse, middle-class like me.

09:22.742 --> 09:26.102
The middle classes have their
virtues, and husbandry is one.

09:28.182 --> 09:32.222
We ought to get back. Sir Philip
thingy's due on the seven o'clock train.

09:32.257 --> 09:34.422
You ought to be there to hold Tom's
hand.

09:34.457 --> 09:36.467
Poor fellow.

09:36.502 --> 09:39.342
He's so terrified, and so thrilled
at the same time.

09:39.377 --> 09:41.342
As I would be.

09:42.062 --> 09:44.062
As I WILL be.

09:49.902 --> 09:54.302
The dear Duchess of Truro is full of
your praises, Sir Philip.

09:54.337 --> 09:56.347
Then of course, you know that.

09:56.382 --> 09:59.942
She had quite a time when she was
first married, but I said to her,

09:59.977 --> 10:03.502
"Never fear, Duchess, I'll get a
baby out of you one way or another."

10:05.622 --> 10:07.147
And so you did.

10:07.182 --> 10:12.622
Three boys, and as a result, a
secure dynasty, I'm glad to say.

10:12.657 --> 10:14.747
But you see no complications here?

10:14.782 --> 10:18.822
None at all. Lady Sybil is a perfect
model of health and beauty.

10:21.342 --> 10:23.742
We told our local doctor
we'd send a message

10:23.743 --> 10:26.142
to him when it looks
as if the baby's coming.

10:26.177 --> 10:29.022
Dr Clarkson has known us all since
we were girls.

10:29.902 --> 10:35.262
Yet what's needed here, Lady Mary, is
a knowledge of childbirth, nothing more.

10:35.297 --> 10:38.862
But if it soothes you, then of
course.

10:39.742 --> 10:41.702
He's most welcome.

10:42.902 --> 10:44.987
I'm going to check on Sybil.

10:45.022 --> 10:48.862
Sorry to trouble you, My Lord, but I
wondered if I might have a word?

10:48.897 --> 10:50.627
Come into the library.

10:50.662 --> 10:53.582
Matthew, will you take Sir Philip to
the drawing room?

10:56.342 --> 10:58.067
Shall we go in?

10:58.102 --> 11:02.742
Sir Philip, I was rather hoping to
have you to myself for a moment.

11:03.822 --> 11:07.227
Do you know that I was injured
during the war?

11:07.262 --> 11:11.062
I think I did hear something about it
from Lady Grantham.

11:11.097 --> 11:13.702
My spine was very severely bruised,

11:14.782 --> 11:17.502
and for a time it seemed I'd lost
the use of my legs,

11:17.537 --> 11:18.907
and...

11:18.942 --> 11:20.547
everything else.

11:20.582 --> 11:25.222
But the bruising reduced, and you
recovered? I have heard of this.

11:25.257 --> 11:28.067
Well, how relieved you must have
been.

11:28.102 --> 11:33.542
Yes, but I wonder now whether the
injury might have...

11:33.577 --> 11:35.942
affected my...

11:38.622 --> 11:40.627
I suppose I mean my fertility.

11:40.662 --> 11:43.782
If it may have limited my chances of
fathering a child.

11:43.817 --> 11:47.782
Well, is...is everything working as
it should?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.107
Yes.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.027
Then um...

11:52.062 --> 11:54.302
why do you think there may be a
problem?

11:54.337 --> 11:57.142
We're anxious to start a family.

11:57.822 --> 12:01.782
We've been married for a few months
without any...results.

12:01.817 --> 12:03.827
My dear Mr Crawley,

12:03.862 --> 12:06.182
may I point out the word that gives
you away?

12:07.422 --> 12:08.907
Anxious.

12:08.942 --> 12:12.322
Anxiety is an enemy to pregnancy.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.702
Don't, whatever you do, feel anxious.

12:17.222 --> 12:21.342
I can run a test if you wish, but I
would urge you

12:21.377 --> 12:24.462
not to bother for some time yet.

12:26.342 --> 12:29.142
There you are. We were wondering
what had happened to you.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.462
This is extraordinary.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.422
Why did the police miss it so
completely?

12:37.942 --> 12:41.142
Mrs Bartlett never spoke to them.
She never spoke to anyone.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.467
Except to you.

12:42.502 --> 12:45.742
She didn't think the truth would
make any difference now.

12:45.777 --> 12:48.267
She thought it was only further
proof of his guilt.

12:48.302 --> 12:52.622
The difficulty is she may not want to
accept Bates' innocence.

12:52.657 --> 12:54.947
Doesn't she have to? Not
necessarily.

12:54.982 --> 12:58.942
She may think he drove his wife to
suicide, and deserves to rot in prison.

12:58.977 --> 13:02.742
In short, she may not wish to tell
the truth to set him free.

13:04.262 --> 13:06.382
Then we need to get a statement from her

13:06.383 --> 13:08.502
before she finds out it
could overturn the case.

13:08.537 --> 13:12.862
I'll telephone Murray tonight. He can come
up here and talk to you, and see Bates.

13:12.897 --> 13:14.907
You were right, though.

13:14.942 --> 13:17.142
The proof was out there, and you
found it.

13:25.382 --> 13:28.827
The editor of The Sketch wants me to
write for him.

13:28.862 --> 13:32.782
He saw my letter to The Times, and
wants to give me a regular column.

13:34.382 --> 13:36.302
How regular?

13:36.337 --> 13:38.187
And what about?

13:38.222 --> 13:41.222
Once a week, and I can write about
whatever I like.

13:42.262 --> 13:45.082
It would be the problems
faced by a modern woman

13:45.083 --> 13:47.902
rather than the fall of the
Ottoman Empire, but even so.

13:47.937 --> 13:50.262
Will you write under your own name?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.107
I hadn't thought.

13:52.142 --> 13:54.242
You won't have an option.
That's what he's buying,

13:54.243 --> 13:56.342
that's what he wants
- your name and title.

13:58.182 --> 14:02.542
I don't know. I thought Edith's letter
to The Times was very interesting.

14:02.577 --> 14:06.142
Don't bother, Matthew - I'm always a
failure in this family.

14:11.462 --> 14:13.422
I'm sad to hear this, Mrs Bird.

14:14.142 --> 14:17.942
And I'm sad to say it, madam, but
it's kept me awake all night,

14:17.977 --> 14:22.262
and I know I cannot work alongside a
woman of the...

14:23.662 --> 14:27.182
..a woman who has chosen that way of
life.

14:27.217 --> 14:28.867
But Miss Parks has changed.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.862
Maybe she has and maybe she hasn't.

14:31.582 --> 14:35.627
But if I tolerate her, I would be
tarnished by it.

14:35.662 --> 14:38.622
Suppose people come to think that I'd
followed the same...

14:38.657 --> 14:40.547
profession as what she has.

14:40.582 --> 14:44.082
Nobody could look at you and think
that, Mrs Bird.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.582
Well, I hope not, because I'm a
respectable woman.

14:48.742 --> 14:52.022
I may not have much, but I have my
good name,

14:52.057 --> 14:54.067
and I must protect it.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.662
You'll have a month's wages in lieu
of notice.

14:56.697 --> 15:00.262
Where will you go? Back to
Manchester.

15:00.297 --> 15:02.467
I can stay with my sister.

15:02.502 --> 15:06.022
She says there's plenty of work for a
plain cook these days.

15:06.057 --> 15:07.982
And they will find one in you.

15:08.822 --> 15:11.542
Goodbye, Mrs Bird, and good luck.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.307
Anything else you need to know about
having babies, Ivy?

15:18.342 --> 15:20.742
Honestly, if I told
Mrs Patmore the things

15:20.743 --> 15:23.142
you two say to me you'd
be up before Mr Carson.

15:23.177 --> 15:25.147
What are you doing with your
afternoon off?

15:25.182 --> 15:27.822
None of your business. I'd like to
make it my business.

15:29.182 --> 15:31.622
Have you greased the cake tins? Yes.

15:31.657 --> 15:33.227
What about the pastry?

15:33.262 --> 15:36.662
It's in the larder. Get started on
the vegetables for tonight.

15:39.422 --> 15:42.102
She doesn't want much, does she? She
doesn't like me.

15:42.137 --> 15:44.142
Why not? I don't know.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.707
She just doesn't.

15:45.742 --> 15:49.062
Well, anyone who doesn't like YOU
needs their head examining.

15:50.102 --> 15:52.182
I hope you agree with him, Jimmy?

15:52.217 --> 15:54.142
That'd be telling.

15:58.382 --> 16:00.342
Are we the first down?

16:00.862 --> 16:03.022
How is Sybil? Sleeping, thank God.

16:03.502 --> 16:07.302
She's been restless all afternoon.
I don't think it'll be long now.

16:07.337 --> 16:09.627
I'm sorry it couldn't have been in
Dublin.

16:09.662 --> 16:12.902
We know how much it meant. Nothing
means more than she does.

16:14.142 --> 16:16.862
And you're sure you have everything
you need? Quite sure.

16:16.897 --> 16:19.027
Hello, Granny. You're here. How nice.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.542
Your grandmother will be with us
every night until the baby's born.

16:22.577 --> 16:24.579
I hate to get news second-hand.

16:24.614 --> 16:26.582
Well, you won't have long to wait.

16:26.862 --> 16:29.627
I thought I'd bring up Dr Clarkson
after we've eaten.

16:29.662 --> 16:33.862
Yes, I've been talking to Lord
Grantham about the good doctor.

16:33.897 --> 16:36.507
Sir Philip feels the room would be
too crowded.

16:36.542 --> 16:39.822
It might be better to leave old
Clarkson out of it for the time being.

16:39.857 --> 16:41.867
But I said I'd telephone.

16:41.902 --> 16:45.142
Well, it really isn't necessary.

16:45.177 --> 16:47.422
I've given him my word.

16:48.942 --> 16:52.102
Why don't I run down in the car
after dinner, and fetch him?

16:53.342 --> 16:57.782
The hollandaise for the fish, put it
in the sauce boats, and do the souffles.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.662
As soon as - Will you just do it?!

17:02.502 --> 17:04.462
Out of my way, quick.

17:06.821 --> 17:08.182
What are you doing?

17:14.182 --> 17:17.387
Haven't you done it? Oh, my God.

17:17.422 --> 17:20.862
What's happened? It's curdled, and it's
got to go up in a minute. Oh, my Lord!

17:20.896 --> 17:24.702
Ivy can manage it. Go on with what
you're doing. Can you really?

17:24.737 --> 17:26.662
I can.

17:27.342 --> 17:29.302
Now what? Give me an egg quick.

17:34.582 --> 17:37.422
Dribble it in. But it's ruined. Do
what I say.

17:41.062 --> 17:43.027
How does that work?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.742
It's magic. It's one of the tricks of
the trade.

17:49.422 --> 17:53.582
How have you done that? Just...one
of the tricks of the trade.

17:55.662 --> 17:59.622
Well, go and take it up. Well done,
Ivy. You played a good one there.

17:59.657 --> 18:02.942
Thank her, Daisy. Yes, thank you.

18:03.822 --> 18:05.822
That didn't hurt at all, did it?

18:07.982 --> 18:10.182
I'll tell you what,
Daisy, Alfred won't like

18:10.183 --> 18:12.382
you any better for being rough on her.

18:14.262 --> 18:16.222
I should have the fish. I'll do it.

18:24.022 --> 18:28.262
There's nothing more tiring
than waiting for something to happen.

18:30.302 --> 18:33.587
Edith, have you written back to your
editor yet?

18:33.622 --> 18:37.822
What's this? Edith has had an
invitation to write a newspaper column.

18:40.302 --> 18:43.982
When may she expect an offer to
appear on the London stage?

18:44.017 --> 18:45.822
See?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.382
Oh, God, is it beginning?

18:56.022 --> 18:57.982
Dinner's suspended, so to speak.

18:59.662 --> 19:03.142
Yes, but suspended cancelled, or
suspended keeping it hot?

19:03.177 --> 19:05.102
What should I do about dinner down
here?

19:05.137 --> 19:07.102
I couldn't tell you.

19:08.462 --> 19:10.422
But...

19:11.742 --> 19:13.827
What do you mean, concerned?

19:13.862 --> 19:17.667
Lady Sybil's ankles are swollen. She
seems...muddled.

19:17.702 --> 19:21.862
What sort of muddled? Not quite
there, not quite in the present moment.

19:21.897 --> 19:25.022
And what do you think it means? It
means she's having a baby.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.502
A word, Dr Clarkson.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.542
Excuse me.

19:35.302 --> 19:37.747
Sir Philip mustn't bully him into
silence.

19:37.782 --> 19:40.782
My dear, this is just Clarkson's
professional pride,

19:40.817 --> 19:43.267
like barber's asking who last cut
your hair.

19:43.302 --> 19:46.502
They always want to be better than
any other practitioner.

19:46.537 --> 19:48.547
But we must listen to what he has to
say.

19:48.582 --> 19:51.507
I quite agree. I don't want to hurt
Sir Philip's feelings.

19:51.542 --> 19:54.602
If there's one thing
that I'm quite indifferent

19:54.603 --> 19:57.662
to it's Sir Philip Tapsell's feelings.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.102
You are upsetting these people for
no reason at all.

20:00.137 --> 20:01.987
I am not!

20:02.022 --> 20:05.027
I think she may be toxaemic, with a
danger of eclampsia.

20:05.062 --> 20:08.747
In which case, we must act fast.
There is no danger whatsoever.

20:08.782 --> 20:13.302
Judging by my experience, Lady Sybil
is behaving perfectly normally.

20:13.337 --> 20:17.062
Do you not find the baby small? Not
unusually so.

20:17.097 --> 20:18.627
And the ankles?

20:18.662 --> 20:21.382
Maybe she has thick ankles. Lots of
women do.

20:21.417 --> 20:22.622
But she does not.

20:23.662 --> 20:26.822
I'm warning you, Doctor, if you wish
to remain,

20:26.857 --> 20:28.987
you must be silent.

20:29.022 --> 20:30.982
I cannot allow you to interfere.

20:34.222 --> 20:35.782
Oh!

20:38.422 --> 20:40.382
Don't be burnt...

20:53.262 --> 20:56.382
Are you all right, Ethel? Only, I
heard a shout.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.542
Fine, ma'am. Everything's fine.

21:00.102 --> 21:02.062
It's a kidney souffle, ma'am.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.922
A kidney souffle? Isn't that a bit
adventurous?

21:05.957 --> 21:08.747
I've seen Mrs Patmore do it a hundred
times.

21:08.782 --> 21:13.782
Yes, but she can't have begun her career
as a cook by making a kidney souffle.

21:16.022 --> 21:18.067
Shall I try something else, ma'am?

21:18.102 --> 21:20.942
No, if we're to avoid a midnight
feast, it's...

21:23.102 --> 21:25.062
..too late to turn back.

21:30.862 --> 21:32.747
Is everything all right?

21:32.782 --> 21:36.582
I think so. I've just come to fetch
some warm milk in case she fancies it.

21:37.782 --> 21:39.787
Mr Carson?

21:39.822 --> 21:41.782
I'm glad I've caught you.

21:43.142 --> 21:47.742
I've had a letter from Mrs Bird
who used to work for Mrs Crawley.

21:47.777 --> 21:50.782
I didn't know she'd gone. Well,
that's the point.

21:58.702 --> 22:01.147
I've been thinking about what we
should do.

22:01.182 --> 22:05.302
You know I have a brother in Liverpool,
and there might be an opening there.

22:05.337 --> 22:07.422
It'd mean working with cars again -
No.

22:09.062 --> 22:12.342
We're not going backwards. You must
promise me that.

22:15.302 --> 22:17.302
God, I wish there was something I
could do.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.827
Just be here.

22:20.862 --> 22:23.062
We can just lie back and look at the
stars.

22:24.474 --> 22:25.747
Is she...?

22:25.782 --> 22:27.742
It's all just as it should be.

22:28.422 --> 22:30.467
Now what?

22:30.502 --> 22:34.262
I want to test the latest sample of
her urine. Oh, for Heaven's sake.

22:34.297 --> 22:37.622
Just give the order to the nurse,
please, Sir Philip.

22:42.782 --> 22:45.747
How's the young mother doing? Am I
on duty, Dr Clarkson?

22:45.782 --> 22:50.622
What? Only I swear I'm not on duty,
otherwise I wouldn't be lying here.

22:52.902 --> 22:55.902
No. No, you're not on duty.

23:04.822 --> 23:07.867
Mrs Crawley has hired a prostitute to
manage her house.

23:07.902 --> 23:12.702
And that's why Mrs Bird felt she had
no choice but to hand in her notice.

23:12.737 --> 23:17.502
Nor did she, poor woman. Mr Carson,
this is Ethel we're talking about.

23:17.537 --> 23:19.587
OUR Ethel.

23:19.622 --> 23:24.042
And Mrs Crawley was just trying to give
her a helping hand. Is that so wrong?

23:24.077 --> 23:28.462
I do not criticise her for her charity,
but she hasn't considered her actions.

23:28.497 --> 23:31.662
No respectable person - certainly, no
respectable woman -

23:31.697 --> 23:33.702
can now be seen entering her house.

23:33.737 --> 23:35.947
But Ethel's given all that up.

23:35.982 --> 23:40.262
I didn't think she was running a
brothel in Mrs Crawley's kitchen.

23:40.297 --> 23:42.707
Can't we say nothing for now?

23:42.742 --> 23:45.982
Mrs Bird's gone, and I don't
remember Ethel as any great cook,

23:46.017 --> 23:48.022
so it may sort itself out.

23:49.714 --> 23:51.267
Very well.

23:51.302 --> 23:54.467
We shall keep silent. For the moment.

23:54.502 --> 23:59.222
But I don't want the maids going into
that house on any pretext whatsoever.

23:59.257 --> 24:01.227
Is that clear?

24:01.262 --> 24:03.222
Quite clear, Mr Carson.

24:04.182 --> 24:06.142
Or the footmen.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.387
It's my belief that Lady Sybil is at
risk of eclampsia.

24:13.422 --> 24:18.142
What is that? A rare condition from
which she is NOT suffering.

24:18.177 --> 24:20.187
Tell him why you think she may be.

24:20.222 --> 24:24.902
Her baby is small, she is confused,
and there is far too much albumen -

24:24.937 --> 24:26.947
that is, protein - in her urine.

24:26.982 --> 24:30.507
Dr Clarkson, please! Have you
forgotten my mother is present?

24:30.542 --> 24:35.362
Please. A woman of my age can face
reality far better than most men.

24:35.397 --> 24:40.147
The fact remains, if I am right, we
must act at once. And do what?

24:40.182 --> 24:44.142
Get her down to the hospital, and
deliver the child by Caesarean section.

24:44.177 --> 24:47.347
But is that safe? It is the opposite
of safe.

24:47.382 --> 24:49.787
It would expose mother and child to
untold danger.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.627
She could pick up any kind of
infection in a public hospital.

24:52.662 --> 24:55.322
An immediate delivery is
the only chance of avoiding

24:55.323 --> 24:57.982
the fits brought on by the
trauma of natural birth!

24:59.622 --> 25:02.587
It may not work, but - Honesty at
last.

25:02.622 --> 25:06.022
Even if she were at risk from
eclampsia, which she is NOT,

25:06.942 --> 25:11.982
a caesarean is a gamble which might
kill either or both of them.

25:12.017 --> 25:14.142
I think we must support Sir Philip
in this.

25:14.177 --> 25:16.182
But it's not our decision.

25:16.217 --> 25:17.827
What does Tom say?

25:17.862 --> 25:19.907
Tom has not hired Sir Philip.

25:19.942 --> 25:23.382
He is not master here, and I will
not put Sybil at risk on a whim.

25:23.417 --> 25:27.019
If you are sure, Sir Philip? I am
quite, quite certain.

25:27.054 --> 25:30.622
You're being ridiculous. Obviously,
we have to talk to Tom.

25:32.062 --> 25:34.022
Don't look at me. Cora is right.

25:35.102 --> 25:37.182
The decision lies with the chauffeur.

25:41.102 --> 25:43.867
How are things going? I'm not sure.

25:43.902 --> 25:46.707
The doctors are arguing. That's never
a good sign.

25:46.742 --> 25:50.942
Is everything all right?
Unfortunately, it seems it is not.

25:53.662 --> 25:56.822
Could we get her to hospital? To move
her would be tantamount to murder.

25:56.857 --> 26:00.619
Sir Philip, admit you're beginning
to detect the symptoms yourself.

26:00.654 --> 26:04.382
You can see her distress! Can you?
Yes, Lady Sybil is in distress.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.427
She's about to give birth.

26:06.462 --> 26:09.187
Lord Grantham, Mr Branson, time is
running out.

26:09.222 --> 26:12.582
We'd be at the hospital by now if we'd
acted at once. The baby would be born.

26:12.617 --> 26:15.742
If she has the operation now, do you
swear you can save her?

26:15.777 --> 26:17.702
I cannot swear it, no.

26:18.822 --> 26:22.382
But if we do not operate, and I am right
about her condition, then she will die.

26:22.417 --> 26:24.742
If, if! Lord Grantham, can you
please take command?

26:24.777 --> 26:26.947
Tom, Dr Clarkson is not sure he can
save her.

26:26.982 --> 26:30.742
Sir Philip is certain he can bring
her through it with a living child.

26:30.777 --> 26:33.267
Isn't a certainty stronger than a
doubt?

26:33.302 --> 26:36.282
I don't mean to insult Sir Philip,
but Dr Clarkson knows Sybil.

26:36.317 --> 26:39.262
He's known her all her life. So
you'd take her to the hospital?

26:39.297 --> 26:42.302
I would've taken her an hour ago!

26:42.337 --> 26:44.062
God help us!

26:55.902 --> 26:57.942
Any news from the house, ma'am?

26:57.977 --> 26:59.987
Not yet.

27:00.022 --> 27:03.262
Matthew said he would try and
telephone if it's not too late.

27:04.102 --> 27:06.142
Lady Sybil was always kind to me.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.102
Yes, she's a very dear girl.

27:11.022 --> 27:12.347
What...

27:12.382 --> 27:13.622
What's in this?

27:14.662 --> 27:16.622
Some honey. Was that not right?

27:18.862 --> 27:20.822
It's perfectly fine for now, Ethel,

27:21.862 --> 27:23.862
but perhaps not another time.

27:26.022 --> 27:28.067
Would you like anything, Mama? No.

27:28.102 --> 27:30.942
Just good news of the baby, and a
car to take me home.

27:30.977 --> 27:33.462
I don't suppose I shall get either
before long.

27:35.302 --> 27:37.362
What about you, Tom?

27:37.397 --> 27:39.387
I just feel so helpless.

27:39.422 --> 27:42.422
We men are always helpless when a
baby's in the picture.

27:46.182 --> 27:48.722
You can come up. It's a girl.

27:48.757 --> 27:51.262
And they're both... They're fine.

27:53.542 --> 27:55.722
Oh, thank God.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.902
And hallelujah!

28:03.022 --> 28:04.942
She's so beautiful.

28:06.062 --> 28:08.022
Oh, my darling,

28:08.622 --> 28:10.582
I do love you so much.

28:15.982 --> 28:17.942
I just want to sleep, really.

28:19.142 --> 28:21.182
Of course you do. You've earned it.

28:21.217 --> 28:23.142
She's a wonderful baby.

28:25.462 --> 28:27.422
I think we should let her sleep.

28:33.502 --> 28:35.462
Very well done. Thank you.

28:41.422 --> 28:43.382
Mama?

28:43.942 --> 28:45.902
Yes, my darling?

28:46.702 --> 28:50.027
Tom is thinking of getting a job in
Liverpool,

28:50.062 --> 28:53.502
going back to being a mechanic, but
it wouldn't be right for him.

28:54.182 --> 28:56.222
He needs to move forward.

28:56.257 --> 28:58.227
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

28:58.262 --> 29:00.302
You don't need to worry about it now.

29:00.337 --> 29:01.907
I think...

29:01.942 --> 29:03.942
Papa may see it as some kind of
answer,

29:04.462 --> 29:05.627
and -

29:05.662 --> 29:07.702
Your father loves you very much.

29:07.737 --> 29:09.662
I know.

29:10.422 --> 29:12.382
I know, and I love him terribly.

29:14.142 --> 29:18.142
But will you help me do battle for
Tom and the baby if the time comes?

29:18.177 --> 29:20.102
Of course. Lady Grantham?

29:21.542 --> 29:23.502
Now sleep, darling.

29:41.502 --> 29:43.867
I'm sorry we doubted. No.

29:43.902 --> 29:46.627
As to that, Lady Grantham, it's
always a good idea

29:46.662 --> 29:49.702
to forget most of what was said
during the waiting time,

29:49.737 --> 29:51.662
and simply enjoy the result.

29:52.462 --> 29:54.502
Is there anything more to be done?

29:54.537 --> 29:55.827
Not really.

29:55.862 --> 30:00.062
The nurse will stay with her, and so
I suggest we all get some sleep,

30:00.097 --> 30:02.342
and meet again refreshed in the
morning.

30:02.377 --> 30:04.382
Show us a card trick, Jimmy.

30:04.417 --> 30:06.387
It's your move.

30:06.422 --> 30:09.142
That's it. The baby is born.

30:09.622 --> 30:11.667
It's a girl.

30:11.702 --> 30:13.782
Fantastic. Now you can all go to
bed.

30:18.302 --> 30:21.507
Good news. Do you like Lady Sybil?

30:21.542 --> 30:24.662
I do. We worked together in the
hospital during the war,

30:24.697 --> 30:27.142
so I know her better than all of
them, really.

30:27.177 --> 30:29.422
She's a lovely person, like you.

30:38.942 --> 30:40.987
Anything the matter? No.

30:41.022 --> 30:44.262
No, but Mr Barrow's so familiar all
the time, isn't he?

30:45.382 --> 30:47.947
I'm glad to hear it. That's a very
good sign.

30:47.982 --> 30:51.902
If he's taken to you, he'll definitely
put in a good word with His Lordship.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.159
I'd like to tell him to keep his
distance.

30:54.194 --> 30:56.382
Do you want to get your marching
orders, then?

30:57.902 --> 30:59.982
Why, what are you implying?

31:00.017 --> 31:02.062
Nothing unseemly, I hope?

31:02.097 --> 31:04.067
No.

31:04.102 --> 31:06.142
No, nothing like that.

31:06.177 --> 31:08.102
Good night.

31:22.422 --> 31:25.702
Mama, wake up! It's Sybil.

31:33.742 --> 31:36.942
Can you hear me, darling? It's Tom.
I should be getting up.

31:36.977 --> 31:39.382
Darling, all you need to do is rest.

31:40.977 --> 31:42.547
Sybil?

31:42.582 --> 31:44.627
My head...!

31:44.662 --> 31:47.662
My head! Sybil? Let me bathe your
forehead.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.622
It hurts!

31:50.662 --> 31:52.302
What's happening?

31:52.337 --> 31:53.959
Oh, God.

31:53.994 --> 31:55.547
Oh, God!

31:55.582 --> 31:58.102
God, no, no! What the hell is
happening?

31:58.137 --> 32:00.062
Sybil? She can't hear me.

32:02.142 --> 32:05.142
Sybil? Sybil, it's Mary. Can you hear
me?

32:05.177 --> 32:06.787
It looks as if -

32:06.822 --> 32:09.422
It looks as if what? This is
eclampsia.

32:09.457 --> 32:10.867
Sybil?

32:10.902 --> 32:13.862
It cannot be, Sir Philip. You were
so sure.

32:14.862 --> 32:17.187
She can't hear me. This is
unbelievable.

32:17.222 --> 32:19.402
Darling... Somebody do something!

32:19.403 --> 32:21.582
The human life is unpredictable.
But you were so sure!

32:21.617 --> 32:23.862
What can we do? Help her, help her,
please!

32:25.742 --> 32:28.787
Oh, God, no! Dr Clarkson, shall we
take her to the hospital?

32:28.822 --> 32:31.947
There's nothing that can be done.
It's not possible, not these days!

32:31.982 --> 32:33.862
Once the seizures have started,
there's nothing to be done.

32:33.863 --> 32:35.742
You don't agree, do you?

32:35.777 --> 32:39.382
Please don't leave me! Help her!
Help her, please!

32:39.417 --> 32:42.539
She can't breathe. Please, just
breathe.

32:42.574 --> 32:45.198
There has to be something worth
trying!

32:45.233 --> 32:47.787
Please! Come on, come on. Breathe,
love.

32:47.822 --> 32:51.422
Come on. Sybil? Listen, it's me, my
darling. All you need to do is breathe.

32:51.457 --> 32:53.342
We've given her morphine, and
atropine.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.842
What's happening?

32:55.877 --> 32:57.502
Please breathe, love!

32:58.862 --> 33:00.067
Please!

33:00.102 --> 33:02.142
She can't breathe.

33:06.782 --> 33:09.222
Oh, no, no!

33:09.257 --> 33:11.039
Please!

33:11.074 --> 33:12.822
Oh, no!

33:16.142 --> 33:19.102
Please, love.

33:21.262 --> 33:23.422
No, no! Please wake up.

33:24.462 --> 33:26.422
Please don't leave me.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.862
Please wake up, love. Please don't
leave me!

33:30.742 --> 33:32.782
Please don't leave me, love!

33:34.694 --> 33:36.467
No! Oh, God!

33:36.502 --> 33:38.462
Please, love.

33:46.742 --> 33:48.702
But this can't be.

33:49.742 --> 33:51.702
She's 24 years old.

33:53.302 --> 33:55.262
This cannot be.

34:19.621 --> 34:21.862
Is there anything we should do, Mr
Carson?

34:22.702 --> 34:24.702
Carry on, Daisy.

34:26.661 --> 34:28.621
As we all must.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.621
Thomas?

34:57.422 --> 34:59.422
I don't know why I'm crying, really.

35:00.942 --> 35:02.982
She wouldn't have noticed if I'd
died.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.062
You don't mean that.

35:08.422 --> 35:11.182
No. No, I don't.

35:14.822 --> 35:17.742
In my life, I can tell you, not many
have been kind to me.

35:18.622 --> 35:20.622
She was one of the few.

35:27.902 --> 35:30.262
Oh... Don't mind me.

35:32.382 --> 35:34.782
The sweetest spirit under this roof
is gone,

35:36.462 --> 35:38.422
and I'm weeping myself.

35:49.822 --> 35:51.782
Are you all right, Mr Carson?

35:54.302 --> 35:56.262
I knew her all her life, you see.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.982
I've known her since she was born.

36:14.902 --> 36:16.862
We'll look after them.

36:19.022 --> 36:20.982
We'll look after them both.

36:22.822 --> 36:24.782
Don't you worry about that.

36:30.942 --> 36:32.902
It's time to go to bed, Mama.

36:33.862 --> 36:35.982
You'll need some rest to face
tomorrow.

36:38.382 --> 36:41.422
Not just yet. This is my chance to
say goodbye to my baby.

36:43.822 --> 36:45.782
You go.

36:46.862 --> 36:48.822
I'll be all right, I promise.

36:49.862 --> 36:53.262
I could stay, or would you prefer to
be alone?

36:54.062 --> 36:56.062
Alone, I think, but thank you.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.142
And Mary?

37:01.462 --> 37:04.902
Could you ask your father to sleep in
the dressing room tonight?

37:11.022 --> 37:12.982
Because you were my baby.

37:16.102 --> 37:18.382
You always will be. Always.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.102
My beauty, my baby.

37:43.422 --> 37:46.467
I've asked Carson to bring Anna
here, Mr Murray,

37:46.502 --> 37:51.502
but I don't think it'll be possible
for you to see Lord Grantham.

37:52.702 --> 37:55.462
Not today. I'm sure you understand.

37:55.497 --> 37:57.422
Of course.

37:59.502 --> 38:04.062
I should have guessed there was something
wrong when there was no car at the station.

38:04.622 --> 38:06.622
What a dreadful, dreadful thing.

38:14.302 --> 38:16.347
I'll leave you to it.

38:16.382 --> 38:20.427
Mr Murray, I wonder if I might have
a word with you before you go?

38:20.462 --> 38:24.182
It's not the best day for it, but there's
no knowing when you might be up here again.

38:24.217 --> 38:26.142
Of course, Mr Crawley.

38:35.902 --> 38:39.142
I am very sorry to trouble you on a
day like this, Mrs Bates.

38:39.177 --> 38:42.702
You weren't to know. None of us
could have known.

38:49.382 --> 38:51.462
The men from Grasby's have arrived.

38:53.742 --> 38:55.782
To take her away?

38:55.817 --> 38:57.787
Yes.

38:57.822 --> 38:59.782
And we must let them.

39:11.262 --> 39:13.262
Goodbye, my darling.

39:30.222 --> 39:34.622
She was the only person living who always
thought you and I were such nice people.

39:36.022 --> 39:37.982
Oh, Mary...

39:41.182 --> 39:44.502
Do you think we might get along a
little better in the future?

39:44.537 --> 39:46.462
I doubt it.

39:48.662 --> 39:52.662
But since this is the last time we
three will all be together in this life,

39:52.697 --> 39:55.662
let's love each other now, as sisters
should.

40:16.862 --> 40:20.662
You see, what I have discovered is
quite simple, Mr Murray.

40:20.697 --> 40:23.062
It's proof of my husband's
innocence.

40:23.097 --> 40:25.022
That seems a good place to start.

40:25.982 --> 40:29.027
Yes, but the key to his innocence

40:29.062 --> 40:31.342
depends on the word of a woman who
hates him,

40:31.862 --> 40:34.702
and may want him to stay in prison
whatever the truth.

40:36.222 --> 40:38.502
Why not tell me everything you know?

41:02.382 --> 41:04.467
Of course, this isn't the right
time,

41:04.502 --> 41:08.462
but you're here, and it's not a
subject for the telephone.

41:08.497 --> 41:11.987
No, but I must confess to you, Mr
Crawley, that

41:12.022 --> 41:16.942
even at this sad hour, your words are
music to my ears.

41:17.862 --> 41:20.987
Testing times are coming for these
estates, indeed.

41:21.022 --> 41:24.822
They've already arrived, and many
great families will go to the wall

41:24.857 --> 41:26.907
over the next few years.

41:26.942 --> 41:31.422
It's never been more vitally important to
maximise the assets of a place like this,

41:31.457 --> 41:33.582
and run it with a solid business
head.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.542
What are you talking about?

41:36.422 --> 41:40.222
Mr Crawley and I were discussing the
management of the estate.

41:40.902 --> 41:44.027
He was outlining some interesting
plans for the future.

41:44.062 --> 41:47.582
And do you intend to involve my
father in these fascinating plans?

41:47.617 --> 41:49.542
Of course.

41:50.102 --> 41:52.762
Then I cannot think this
a very appropriate moment

41:52.763 --> 41:55.422
to be deciding the destiny
of Downton, Mr Murray,

41:55.457 --> 41:58.959
when my sister's body has just been
removed from the house,

41:58.994 --> 42:02.462
and my father is quite unable to see
or speak to anyone.

42:06.742 --> 42:10.262
I'm really only here to talk to Mrs
Bates about her new evidence.

42:10.297 --> 42:12.267
Naturally, if I'd known...

42:12.302 --> 42:14.387
No, no, that's quite different.

42:14.422 --> 42:18.742
None of us would wish to keep Bates in
prison for an hour longer than necessary.

42:18.777 --> 42:21.382
Shall I fetch her? I've already seen
her.

42:22.462 --> 42:25.262
Now I'm on my way to York to visit
Bates,

42:25.297 --> 42:28.027
and learn what he has to say about
it.

42:28.062 --> 42:30.502
Then thank you so much for coming
all this way.

42:31.102 --> 42:35.102
Lady Mary, please tell your parents
how very sorry I am.

42:35.137 --> 42:37.062
Of course.

42:38.502 --> 42:40.462
Mr Murray is just leaving.

42:54.702 --> 42:58.102
I'm sorry, darling. Forgive me. I
wasn't thinking.

42:58.137 --> 43:00.199
It's just Murray was in the house...

43:00.234 --> 43:02.262
Papa has lost his youngest daughter.

43:02.297 --> 43:04.307
I think that's enough.

43:04.342 --> 43:07.542
Or does he have to lose control of
his estate on the same day?

43:16.222 --> 43:18.862
And the challenge is
to get a statement from

43:18.863 --> 43:21.502
Mrs Bartlett before she
realises its significance.

43:21.537 --> 43:23.462
That's it.

43:25.182 --> 43:27.302
I can't stop thinking about Lady
Sybil.

43:29.062 --> 43:31.782
A lovely young woman at the height
of her happiness.

43:32.742 --> 43:35.142
If I had any beliefs, that would
shake them.

43:35.177 --> 43:37.102
Make your way out now.

43:38.182 --> 43:40.142
I'll keep you informed, Mr Bates.

43:40.862 --> 43:42.902
I'll do my very best for you.

43:42.937 --> 43:44.862
Thank you, Mr Murray.

43:47.862 --> 43:49.822
I suppose that's his lawyer.

43:51.142 --> 43:53.187
Lord Grantham's lawyer, more like.

43:53.222 --> 43:56.162
I don't care if he's lawyer to the
Prince of Wales.

43:56.197 --> 43:59.102
He'll get a shock when he contacts
Mrs Audrey Bartlett.

44:11.062 --> 44:13.902
Oh, Carson. Good afternoon, my Lady.

44:16.142 --> 44:18.102
We've seen some troubles, you and I.

44:20.582 --> 44:24.222
Nothing worse than this. Nothing
could be worse than this, my Lady.

44:56.062 --> 44:58.067
Mama.

44:58.102 --> 45:00.062
Oh, my dears.

45:03.022 --> 45:06.142
You'll be glad to know they've found
a nurse for the baby.

45:06.177 --> 45:08.902
She is already here. Good, good.

45:11.222 --> 45:13.267
Where's Tom?

45:13.302 --> 45:15.982
He's upstairs. I've asked if he wants
anything.

45:16.017 --> 45:17.942
He says no.

45:18.822 --> 45:21.662
He wants his wife back, but that's
what he can't have.

45:24.382 --> 45:27.782
I must write to Dr Clarkson and have
it sent down before dinner.

45:30.622 --> 45:33.742
Darling, there's no need for that.
I should. I want to.

45:33.777 --> 45:35.862
I have to apologise for our
behaviour.

45:35.897 --> 45:37.502
What?

45:37.537 --> 45:38.627
Why?

45:38.662 --> 45:42.042
Because if we'd listened to him,
Sybil might still be alive.

45:42.077 --> 45:45.422
But Sir Philip and your father knew
better, and now she's dead.

45:50.862 --> 45:52.822
Why... Why did she say that?

45:54.782 --> 45:56.742
Because there is some truth in it.

45:58.502 --> 46:01.102
My dear, when tragedies strike,

46:01.137 --> 46:03.667
we try to find someone to blame.

46:03.702 --> 46:08.022
In the absence of a suitable
candidate, we usually blame ourselves.

46:09.182 --> 46:12.502
You are not to blame. No-one is to
blame.

46:14.262 --> 46:20.022
Our darling Sybil has died during
childbirth,

46:21.622 --> 46:23.662
like too many women before her,

46:23.697 --> 46:25.622
and all we can do now...

46:27.502 --> 46:29.462
..is cherish her memory,

46:29.942 --> 46:31.902
and her child.

46:33.342 --> 46:35.302
Nevertheless, there is truth in it.
