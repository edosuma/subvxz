WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:04.366
Hey, sweetheart.
What's up?

00:04.401 --> 00:06.084
I had a bad dream.

00:06.119 --> 00:07.910
Oh? What happened?

00:07.945 --> 00:09.756
There was a big fire,

00:09.791 --> 00:11.532
and you, Uncle Franco,

00:11.567 --> 00:15.868
and Uncle Sean
and Uncle Kenny

00:15.903 --> 00:17.766
saved all the people.

00:17.801 --> 00:19.667
But then you heard
somebody crying,

00:19.702 --> 00:25.235
and you ran back into the fire,
and you got killed by it.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.500
Sweetheart,
listen to me.

00:26.535 --> 00:30.133
Daddy is not gonna die
in a big fire.

00:30.168 --> 00:34.369
Daddy is not gonna disappear
in a big fire, okay?

00:34.404 --> 00:35.703
'Cause daddy's golden right now.

00:35.738 --> 00:37.034
Drink your juice.

00:37.069 --> 00:38.436
And I'm making
your favorite eggs.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.520
I am so late.

00:39.555 --> 00:40.645
Well, you gotta eat.

00:40.680 --> 00:41.701
I don't have time, Dad.

00:41.733 --> 00:43.579
I'm meeting Jennifer
in, like, five minutes.

00:43.639 --> 00:45.113
Um... here.

00:47.570 --> 00:48.802
Uh, let's see...

00:48.837 --> 00:50.637
Two hundred should be enough
for the weekend, right?

00:50.672 --> 00:51.868
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:51.903 --> 00:53.103
Thanks, Daddy.
I love you.

00:53.138 --> 00:54.303
- Call me.
- I will.

00:54.337 --> 00:56.558
Oh, and, uh, Mom's cool
with this, right?

00:56.648 --> 00:59.151
Don't worry about Mom.
I'll take care of her.

00:59.405 --> 01:00.536
Hey.

01:00.571 --> 01:01.837
Oh, my God.

01:01.872 --> 01:03.069
How you doing?

01:03.104 --> 01:06.371
- A little rocky.
- Really?

01:06.406 --> 01:08.938
Auntie Sheila, can we
make cookies today?

01:08.973 --> 01:11.039
Of course, baby.

01:11.074 --> 01:13.105
You want eggs?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.204
Coffee.

01:14.239 --> 01:16.038
I gotta get my own room.

01:16.073 --> 01:17.438
Connor's toys are
all over the place.

01:17.473 --> 01:19.973
Plus, he's been screwing
with my computer again.

01:20.008 --> 01:21.007
Is he awake yet?

01:21.042 --> 01:21.971
No, of course not.

01:22.006 --> 01:24.004
He was up till 4:00
playing Game Boy.

01:24.039 --> 01:25.840
Why don't you go wake up
your brother, honey.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.905
Connor!

01:27.940 --> 01:30.907
You know what? We can
do that, all right?

01:30.942 --> 01:32.773
Go up and get him.

01:32.808 --> 01:35.172
When I was your age,
I shared a room

01:35.207 --> 01:37.908
with two of my brothers
until I was 17 years old,

01:37.943 --> 01:40.609
and your dad shared a room
with two of his sisters

01:40.644 --> 01:42.006
till he was the same age

01:42.041 --> 01:43.442
because he didn't have
any other choice.

01:43.477 --> 01:46.075
Let me tell you
something else--

01:46.110 --> 01:47.642
Hey, asshole.

01:47.677 --> 01:49.175
Hey, asshole.

01:52.143 --> 01:53.274
This is a cop bar.

01:53.309 --> 01:55.376
Yeah, I know.
I got two brothers who are cops.

01:55.411 --> 01:57.808
Not in this precinct.

01:57.843 --> 02:00.309
You know, you guys can't just
wander in wherever you want.

02:00.344 --> 02:01.977
You guys were heroes
for, like, 10 minutes,

02:02.012 --> 02:03.342
but that bullshit's over now.

02:03.377 --> 02:05.677
All right, go ahead.
Go ahead. Take a shot.

02:05.712 --> 02:06.676
What?

02:06.711 --> 02:08.175
Take a swing. Go ahead.

02:08.210 --> 02:11.110
Hey, anybody's getting the first
shot in this situation,

02:11.145 --> 02:12.110
it's gonna be you, bitch.

02:12.145 --> 02:13.878
Really?

02:13.913 --> 02:15.529
Go ahead.

02:15.564 --> 02:17.110
Thanks, man.

02:17.145 --> 02:18.111
I really
appreciate that.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.480 --> 02:39.080
Tommy, what's going on?
You got a problem?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.045
Sanctuary, boys.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.878
Yeah, you got some balls, Gavin,

02:41.913 --> 02:44.013
coming in our precinct,
drinking at our favorite bar.

02:44.048 --> 02:45.514
Hey, free country, asshole.

02:45.549 --> 02:46.946
Well, I got you
for speeding.

02:46.981 --> 02:50.014
I know you're boozed up about
five times over the legal limit,

02:50.049 --> 02:52.213
not to mention
assaulting a police officer.

02:52.248 --> 02:54.213
Off-duty, and he told me
to take the first shot.

02:54.248 --> 02:57.516
I swear to God, Gavin, you so
much as spit on the sidewalk--

03:00.282 --> 03:01.414
What else you got?

03:01.449 --> 03:03.547
- I guess you don't remember, huh?
- What?

03:03.582 --> 03:06.282
You step on the ice against us
in three days, shithead.

03:06.317 --> 03:09.081
Shit. Is that this week?

03:09.116 --> 03:11.749
- Yeah, it sure is.
- Goddamn it.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.746
You really thought this through,
numbnuts, huh?

03:13.851 --> 03:15.581
I'll see you soon.

03:16.949 --> 03:19.049
You forgot you were playing
those guys this week?

03:19.084 --> 03:20.583
Are you crazy?

03:20.618 --> 03:22.401
Yeah.
Crazy like a fox.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.184
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

03:32.338 --> 03:35.538
SANCTUARY

04:18.156 --> 04:19.421
Yeah. Ryan.

04:19.456 --> 04:21.055
Listen, I need you
to play for me.

04:21.089 --> 04:22.788
Are you kidding me?

04:22.823 --> 04:24.987
You get my ass
kicked off the team.

04:25.022 --> 04:27.656
I knew you'd be begging me back,
you piece of shit.

04:27.691 --> 04:30.290
Look, we got our last game
against the cops coming up.

04:30.325 --> 04:31.522
I got these guys.
Sitting ducks.

04:31.557 --> 04:32.956
I've been pissing them
off for weeks,

04:32.991 --> 04:34.240
especially
Red Collins.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.455
I'm telling you, these guys

04:35.490 --> 04:37.090
are like a balloon
waiting to be popped.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.791
It's the perfect
situation.

04:38.826 --> 04:40.275
- All right, I'm in.
- Nice.

04:40.310 --> 04:41.690
Practice tomorrow at 3:00.

04:41.725 --> 04:44.324
You want to beat them?
I got a guy you gotta get.

04:44.359 --> 04:45.289
Who?

04:45.324 --> 04:46.423
Mungo Monahan.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.922
Is he a firefighter?

04:47.957 --> 04:49.893
Technically, no. He's out
on leave of absence.

04:49.928 --> 04:51.157
And that was due to--

04:51.192 --> 04:53.325
He beat up three cops
at a St. Paddy's dance.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.025
They couldn't even
put the cuffs on him.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.357
He can score at will.

04:56.392 --> 04:59.159
Big as a goddamn triple-decker,
and he loves to fight.

04:59.194 --> 05:00.626
Call him in. Get him.

05:00.661 --> 05:02.458
All right.

05:02.493 --> 05:07.527
Secret evil plan
Secret evil plan

05:07.562 --> 05:10.093
I am secret-evil-planman...

05:26.362 --> 05:27.362
Oh, my God.

05:27.397 --> 05:29.193
Happy?

05:29.228 --> 05:31.528
Yeah. It's like brunch
at The Ritz.

05:31.563 --> 05:33.829
Look at this bacon.
It's so flat.

05:33.864 --> 05:35.030
I have my method.

05:35.065 --> 05:36.197
This is amazing.

05:36.232 --> 05:37.294
And there's, like--

05:37.329 --> 05:38.663
there's, like, no grease
or anything.

05:38.698 --> 05:40.361
How do you do that?

05:40.396 --> 05:41.628
You're a witch, aren't you?

05:41.663 --> 05:43.261
It's the only possible
explanation.

05:43.296 --> 05:47.547
You had no idea who you're
getting involved with.

05:47.582 --> 05:51.798
You're like some very sexy
goddess of pork products.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.981
Oh, I like this.

05:54.016 --> 05:56.095
I like this a lot.

05:56.130 --> 05:59.632
Does that mean you're not gonna
come back upstairs?

05:59.667 --> 06:00.765
Can I bring the bacon?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.532
Mm.

06:09.599 --> 06:10.699
Ah.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.433
Yeah, yeah.

06:16.468 --> 06:17.398
Yeah?

06:17.433 --> 06:18.564
Where are you?

06:18.599 --> 06:19.598
I'm at the firehouse.
Why?

06:19.633 --> 06:21.031
'Cause I just
called your place,

06:21.066 --> 06:23.267
and Uncle Teddy said you
never came home last night.

06:23.302 --> 06:25.065
- So... Who is she?
- Who?

06:25.100 --> 06:27.265
The bitch that you were out with
last night.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.667
Baby, you're the only bitch
I'm seeing these days.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.233
You sound drunk.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.566
I should. I am drunk.

06:37.601 --> 06:40.835
You are such a bad boy.
What am I gonna do with you?

06:40.870 --> 06:43.401
- You need something?
- Yes, I do.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.035
Uncle Teddy said
that you and the guys

06:45.070 --> 06:46.000
were going to Belmont.

06:46.035 --> 06:47.534
I love looking
at the horses.

06:47.569 --> 06:49.818
They're so powerful,
and they're so majestic.

06:49.853 --> 06:52.068
I always wanted a horse
when I was a little girl,

06:52.103 --> 06:53.735
even when
I was an altar girl.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.403
Um, I think it's that whole
Catherine the Great story.

06:56.438 --> 06:57.502
You know what I mean?

06:57.537 --> 07:00.470
You know how she got
crushed to death

07:00.505 --> 07:03.403
when she was having sex
with a horse.

07:03.438 --> 07:05.488
Hello?

07:05.523 --> 07:07.538
Tommy?

07:09.937 --> 07:12.004
I'm getting a goddamn horse.

07:17.906 --> 07:19.970
Hey.

07:20.005 --> 07:21.806
How long do you plan
on keeping that down?

07:21.841 --> 07:24.936
Shut up, smartass.

07:24.971 --> 07:28.540
You know, I've been thinking
about this whole bulimia thing.

07:28.575 --> 07:30.605
- Yeah?
- How bad could it be, really?

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
I mean, how often do you hear
about people dying

07:32.675 --> 07:33.805
from throwing up, you know?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.371
I've watched those
doctor and crime shows,

07:36.406 --> 07:39.908
and how often do they say,
"Cause of death: puking"?

07:39.943 --> 07:42.508
You know, I mean,
what's the worst

07:42.543 --> 07:45.038
- that could really happen?
- Um, well...

07:45.073 --> 07:49.107
Eventually the stomach acid will
eat the enamel off my teeth,

07:49.142 --> 07:52.141
and, uh, maybe tear a hole
in my esophagus.

07:54.442 --> 07:57.041
But, like...
a long time from now, right?

07:57.076 --> 07:58.840
Well, a few years.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.740
Great.
We'll just deal with it then.

08:00.775 --> 08:04.342
Oh, so you think we'll still
be together then?

08:04.377 --> 08:07.010
Yeah, I do.

08:07.045 --> 08:09.643
Oh, Mike.

08:14.210 --> 08:15.811
Looks like
he knows what he's doing.

08:15.846 --> 08:17.544
I know
what he's looking at.

08:20.243 --> 08:21.575
I needed this today, Tom.

08:21.629 --> 08:23.930
I needed to get the hell
out of the house.

08:23.975 --> 08:25.704
- Wife giving you trouble?
- Nah.

08:25.745 --> 08:28.745
She, uh...
She might have a problem.

08:28.780 --> 08:29.710
What kind of problem?

08:29.745 --> 08:30.909
I don't want
to say anything

08:30.944 --> 08:33.094
until we know for sure,
you know?

08:33.129 --> 08:35.210
She goes in
for an MRI tomorrow,

08:35.245 --> 08:36.846
and then she's got
to see the doctor--

08:36.881 --> 08:38.244
Holy shit.

08:38.279 --> 08:41.078
Testing.
Evaluating, you know?

08:41.113 --> 08:43.462
Is it life-threatening?

08:43.498 --> 08:45.813
Not for her,
only for me.

08:45.848 --> 08:46.978
Wow.

08:47.013 --> 08:48.814
Well, you're here today
to have some fun, right?

08:48.849 --> 08:50.079
Win some money,
hopefully.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.345
- Hey.
- What?

08:51.380 --> 08:52.580
- What's up?
- What do you got?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.178
He smiled.

08:54.213 --> 08:56.513
Last time he smiled like that,
I won almost 15 grand.

08:56.548 --> 08:58.181
Get ready to place your bets,
boys.

08:58.216 --> 08:59.413
Let's go
to the window.

08:59.448 --> 09:00.880
So it's going great, you know?

09:00.915 --> 09:03.314
Great movie, great dinner,
nice drinks, conversation.

09:03.349 --> 09:04.898
I finally get her back
to my place.

09:04.933 --> 09:06.448
And this chick is smokin',
right?

09:06.483 --> 09:08.466
Oh, yeah. Smokin'.

09:08.501 --> 09:10.414
Smoking's bad for you.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.948
Daddy, can I get this purse?

09:12.983 --> 09:14.065
Hey, baby.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.113
You know what?

09:15.148 --> 09:16.648
I saw some nice
jackets over there.

09:16.683 --> 09:18.148
Why don't you go
pick one out, huh?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.248
- Okay.
- Bye.

09:20.283 --> 09:22.149
Shit, where was I?

09:22.184 --> 09:23.114
Tits.

09:23.149 --> 09:24.483
Fantastic.

09:24.518 --> 09:25.667
Nipples?

09:25.702 --> 09:26.942
Perfect.

09:26.977 --> 09:28.263
- Big?
- Small.

09:28.298 --> 09:29.550
Hi. How are you?

09:31.350 --> 09:32.818
Come here.

09:34.517 --> 09:36.000
So you get her naked.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.409
No. It all goes to shit.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.749
Well, what happened?

09:38.784 --> 09:40.449
- Well, bad kisser.
- Oh, damn.

09:40.484 --> 09:42.301
You mean like
"can't kiss at all" bad kisser,

09:42.336 --> 09:44.118
or "just a little sloppy
and drunk" bad kisser?

09:44.153 --> 09:46.151
Um, no, just bad--
bad kisser.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.283
Just bad.

09:47.318 --> 09:48.684
I faked
a pulled hamstring.

09:48.719 --> 09:50.016
Said I had to
be up early.

09:50.051 --> 09:51.452
Ah, gave her the double excuse.
Nice.

09:51.487 --> 09:52.817
Yeah, but now
what do I do?

09:52.852 --> 09:55.618
I mean, she's really
smart and sexy and nice.

09:55.653 --> 09:57.985
I don't know how to handle the
whole bad-kissing situation.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.186
Just call her and tell her
you want to be friends.

10:00.221 --> 10:01.786
You just got out
of a long-term thing,

10:01.821 --> 10:03.970
- blah, blah, blah.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:04.005 --> 10:06.120
Daddy, can I have
all this stuff?

10:06.155 --> 10:07.552
Ooh, sweetie, look.

10:07.587 --> 10:08.985
I found the perfect
thing, huh?

10:09.020 --> 10:11.821
Let's put all this stuff back
and just buy this, all right?

10:11.856 --> 10:12.786
Come on.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.185
Wow. Spoil her, huh, Frank?

10:14.220 --> 10:16.822
Number 8's feeling sore
in his right front fetlock.

10:16.857 --> 10:17.887
Not his day.

10:17.922 --> 10:20.638
But number 3?
He's never felt better.

10:20.673 --> 10:23.319
Plus, he hates number 1,
who's gay,

10:23.354 --> 10:25.688
who's got a crush on number 2,
who's not.

10:25.723 --> 10:28.654
So I'd say our boy's number 3.

10:28.689 --> 10:30.554
Because number 2 is pretty
goddamn fast,

10:30.589 --> 10:32.589
which means number 1's gonna be
right on that ass,

10:32.624 --> 10:33.788
'cause he's gay.

10:33.823 --> 10:36.354
So that's gonna even things out.

10:36.389 --> 10:40.023
So that's gonna open the door
for our boy, number 3. Bingo!

10:40.058 --> 10:42.655
The number 1 horse
is gay?

10:42.690 --> 10:44.673
Hey, it ain't like
humans have the lock

10:44.708 --> 10:46.657
on the guys-blowing-
other-guys thing.

10:46.692 --> 10:48.023
Come on.
Let's bet.

10:48.058 --> 10:49.191
This is crazy.

10:49.226 --> 10:50.289
Horses are gay?

10:50.324 --> 10:51.925
How do you know
that horses are gay?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.591
Come on! Come on!

10:53.626 --> 10:54.692
Yeah! Yeah!

10:54.727 --> 10:55.758
Come on!

10:57.891 --> 10:59.858
Number 3 wins!

11:14.827 --> 11:17.359
You, uh, hit the jackpot?

11:17.394 --> 11:19.124
Yeah.

11:19.159 --> 11:20.892
Looks like it.

11:20.927 --> 11:28.761
You taking care
of two families now?

11:28.796 --> 11:31.628
None of your business.

11:31.663 --> 11:34.426
My cousin and I, uh,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.361
we pledged to, uh, each take
care of the other guy's family

11:37.396 --> 11:38.860
in case...

11:38.895 --> 11:40.226
If what happened, happened.

11:40.261 --> 11:42.829
But you're kinda getting off
on it a little, right?

11:42.864 --> 11:45.860
I mean, now you're
the big sugar daddy,

11:45.895 --> 11:49.145
which allows you to excuse
all of your abhorrent behavior

11:49.180 --> 11:52.396
and also ensures that none
of the key women in your life

11:52.431 --> 11:53.362
are empowered.

11:54.729 --> 11:57.830
Empowered?

11:57.865 --> 12:00.896
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:00.931 --> 12:02.928
Let me tell you something.

12:02.963 --> 12:05.630
My wife was planning
on going to college.

12:05.665 --> 12:08.297
She was thinking of being
a marine biologist,

12:08.332 --> 12:09.663
believe it or not,

12:09.698 --> 12:12.465
when she, um, found out that she
was pregnant with our first kid,

12:12.500 --> 12:17.431
and she decided she
wanted to be a hands-on mom.

12:17.466 --> 12:19.096
She wanted to have,
like, three kids.

12:19.131 --> 12:21.998
Not like some of these broads
who, you know, have three kids

12:22.033 --> 12:23.799
and then you know,
a full-time job in Manhattan

12:23.834 --> 12:25.330
and are never home,

12:25.365 --> 12:28.649
so their kids are raised
by some Nicaraguan nanny.

12:28.684 --> 12:31.899
My wife fed and bathed
and clothed those kids.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.834
Taught them how to act,
what was right, what was wrong,

12:34.869 --> 12:36.298
how to treat people,

12:36.333 --> 12:39.366
how not to judge people based on
the color of their skin.

12:39.401 --> 12:42.301
It's pretty much the most
important job on the planet,

12:42.336 --> 12:45.201
and I think my wife has done--
done it better than most.

12:46.768 --> 12:47.901
Do you ever tell her that?

13:01.834 --> 13:03.894
- You're gonna love this one.
- What do we got?

13:03.939 --> 13:05.248
Lady said she smelled
something foul

13:05.294 --> 13:06.365
coming from her
neighbor's.

13:06.403 --> 13:07.902
She thinks the neighbor
may be dead.

13:07.937 --> 13:10.003
And she's calling us
instead of the cops?

13:10.038 --> 13:12.034
Yes, because, dead or alive,
the neighbor

13:12.069 --> 13:14.069
hasn't left the apartment
in over three years.

13:14.104 --> 13:15.134
Why is that?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.204
That's what I think
you're gonna love.

13:17.239 --> 13:19.002
Christ.

13:19.037 --> 13:21.037
What do you have to eat
to get this big?

13:21.072 --> 13:22.169
How about
New Hampshire?

13:22.212 --> 13:24.077
High blood pressure.
Who would have guessed?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.611
Oh, God.
I need a mask.

13:25.673 --> 13:27.989
I thought masks
were for pussies.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.305
Call me Shirley.
Christ, the stench.

13:30.340 --> 13:31.503
Come on, guys.

13:31.538 --> 13:34.338
Let's have a little
respect for the dead...

13:34.373 --> 13:36.437
The incredibly fat dead.

13:36.472 --> 13:38.839
Probie, kind of makes
your girlfriend

13:38.874 --> 13:40.504
look a little skinny,
huh?

13:40.539 --> 13:42.889
Let's figure out
how the hell to get her out.

13:42.924 --> 13:45.239
Isn't there a company here
that has a cargo net?

13:45.274 --> 13:47.223
- 81 truck.
- We hook it to the ladder,

13:47.258 --> 13:49.172
ladder comes up
to the window--

13:49.207 --> 13:50.338
I'll get on the horn.

13:50.373 --> 13:51.774
We'll have to take
this window out.

13:51.809 --> 13:52.739
I gotta grab some tools.

13:52.774 --> 13:54.272
Franco, Sean, go do me a favor.

13:54.307 --> 13:56.507
Find something big enough
to cover her up with, okay?

13:56.542 --> 13:58.407
Let's hope the circus
is in town.

13:58.442 --> 14:00.572
Come on, ladies, push.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.074
Where the hell is Tommy
with that wedge? Tommy!

14:03.109 --> 14:04.675
Come on, Garrity.
Put a little muscle in.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.139
I'm afraid.

14:06.174 --> 14:08.441
Of what? She's dead.
It's not like she'll eat you.

14:08.476 --> 14:10.708
I don't know what part I have.
Is this her ass?

14:10.743 --> 14:12.006
Keep pushing.

14:12.041 --> 14:14.008
You go in up to your elbow,
it's ass.

14:14.043 --> 14:15.741
Oh, I can't--

14:15.776 --> 14:17.574
- Will you cut it out?!
- I can't.

14:17.609 --> 14:19.509
Come on. Get downstairs.
Make yourself useful.

14:19.544 --> 14:21.409
Grab the probie,
have them move the rig away.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.409
We'll push from here.

14:22.444 --> 14:26.875
Go. Go.

14:26.910 --> 14:27.941
- Oh, shit.
- What?

14:27.976 --> 14:29.610
It just ate my watch.

14:29.645 --> 14:31.010
Oh, Jesus.

14:31.045 --> 14:32.341
I'm done.

14:32.376 --> 14:34.676
Get somebody else to take
the bottom.

14:34.711 --> 14:36.942
Yeah, hold it steady there,
all right?

14:36.977 --> 14:42.211
When the guys come down, we'll
bring it down nice and slow.

14:42.246 --> 14:43.443
What's going on?

14:43.478 --> 14:44.942
Oh, some giant fat lady died.

14:44.977 --> 14:46.444
We're just trying
to bring her down.

14:48.445 --> 14:50.395
No!

14:50.430 --> 14:52.310
No!

14:52.345 --> 14:53.911
You got to go on a diet, chief.

14:53.946 --> 14:55.345
I'm telling you that much
right now.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.879
Immediately,
I'm going on one.

14:56.914 --> 14:57.845
Holy shit.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.213
I'm going to kick
your ass!

15:02.179 --> 15:04.462
Hey, hey, hey!

15:04.497 --> 15:06.746
Come on! Come on!

15:06.781 --> 15:09.314
You asshole!

15:09.349 --> 15:11.813
Hey, hey! Hey!

15:11.848 --> 15:13.914
You killed my mama!

15:13.949 --> 15:15.980
Calm down!

15:16.015 --> 15:17.181
Come on!

15:17.216 --> 15:18.481
Come on!

15:18.516 --> 15:19.712
Come on!

15:19.747 --> 15:21.513
Stop right there!
I know why you're doing this.

15:21.548 --> 15:24.582
You think we hurt your mother.
We did not hurt your mother.

15:24.617 --> 15:25.847
She died in there.

15:25.882 --> 15:27.847
This is the only way we could
get her out.

15:27.882 --> 15:30.081
How do you think your mother
would feel if she knew

15:30.116 --> 15:31.346
you were hurting the people

15:31.381 --> 15:33.382
trying to help her get
to her final resting place?

15:33.417 --> 15:36.683
Do you think she'd be happy
about that?

15:36.718 --> 15:37.947
Come on, now.

15:37.982 --> 15:40.382
No.
No, she wouldn't.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.783
Now, put that down.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.550
Attaboy.

15:45.617 --> 15:49.150
Good-- good boy.
Yeah.

15:51.217 --> 15:55.451
- That's my mama!
- Okay.

15:55.486 --> 15:58.017
That's my mama!

16:00.952 --> 16:02.868
Hey, you guys,
you guys.

16:02.903 --> 16:04.750
I propose a toast
to Laura.

16:04.785 --> 16:06.586
You really saved our necks
out there today, girl.

16:06.621 --> 16:07.818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:07.853 --> 16:10.202
- Yeah, you really did a great job, kid.
- Finally.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.552
Yeah, I thought Tommy
was a goner for sure.

16:12.587 --> 16:14.317
Come on. I'm golden.

16:14.352 --> 16:15.851
Yeah, you'd have been
real golden

16:15.886 --> 16:17.886
with a Halligan
hanging our of your ass.

16:17.921 --> 16:19.852
She really did save you, Tommy.
Come on.

16:19.887 --> 16:21.887
Look, I don't want to
give her too much credit,

16:21.922 --> 16:23.285
but she obviously
has a talent

16:23.320 --> 16:25.986
for calming down overwrought
400-pound black men.

16:26.021 --> 16:27.987
Thank you, lieutenant.

16:28.022 --> 16:29.087
Hey, call me Lou.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.754
Aw. Really?

16:30.789 --> 16:32.254
No.

16:33.955 --> 16:35.619
Hey, to Laura.

16:35.654 --> 16:37.955
Yeah, may she forever be...
empowered.

16:41.755 --> 16:43.788
...leave your car here.

16:43.823 --> 16:45.822
I'll call you Monday.

16:52.756 --> 16:54.423
- Wow.
- That's a nice view, huh?

16:54.458 --> 16:55.421
Yeah.

16:55.456 --> 16:59.823
Never be the same for me.

16:59.858 --> 17:01.124
Yeah,
me neither.

17:01.159 --> 17:02.355
Even when they put up

17:02.390 --> 17:03.923
whatever it is
they're putting up.

17:03.958 --> 17:06.824
It's like they're trying to
erase what happened, you know?

17:06.858 --> 17:08.321
It's insulting.

17:08.382 --> 17:10.959
Remember they had those
spotlights right after 9/11?

17:11.550 --> 17:12.828
I couldn't take that.

17:13.828 --> 17:16.415
I like it like this.
Empty.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.590
Just the way those
scumbags left it.

17:19.626 --> 17:22.558
No spotlights.
No new buildings.

17:22.593 --> 17:25.092
Just empty.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.458
Yeah.

17:26.492 --> 17:29.524
That's the thing about
the spotlight, you know?

17:29.559 --> 17:33.292
You walk out into it, at first,
everybody thinks they see

17:33.327 --> 17:35.927
a good-looking,
all-American hero.

17:35.962 --> 17:38.492
Then you stay out there
long enough,

17:38.527 --> 17:40.126
you know, they start to notice
certain things.

17:40.161 --> 17:41.594
Maybe your nose
is a little crooked.

17:41.629 --> 17:43.325
Maybe your teeth are too.

17:43.360 --> 17:47.828
You got a little scar
on your upper lip.

17:47.863 --> 17:49.092
Your hair's
not right.

17:49.127 --> 17:50.328
One eye's bigger
than the other.

17:50.363 --> 17:51.795
Next thing you know,

17:51.830 --> 17:52.959
they think

17:52.994 --> 17:56.127
they're looking
at some kind of goddamn monster,

17:56.162 --> 17:59.162
like they're looking
at, uh, King Kong,

17:59.197 --> 18:02.162
and they start throwing shit
at you.

18:02.197 --> 18:03.162
I'll tell you
one thing.

18:03.197 --> 18:05.794
That morning,

18:05.829 --> 18:08.529
they threw a couple of jets
into a couple of buildings,

18:08.564 --> 18:10.880
and they threw at us
the biggest job

18:10.915 --> 18:13.196
in the history
of our profession.

18:13.231 --> 18:14.361
And what did we do?

18:14.396 --> 18:21.064
We gave up 343 of our guys
to save...

18:21.099 --> 18:22.463
at least 10,000.

18:22.498 --> 18:25.029
Yeah.
But look at us now.

18:25.064 --> 18:28.831
Three years later, still waiting
for a goddamn raise.

18:28.866 --> 18:31.329
Tell you what,
guys.

18:31.364 --> 18:33.414
We were on our own
that morning.

18:33.449 --> 18:35.465
We're still on our own today.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.949
Come on. Let's go.

18:36.984 --> 18:38.398
Come on, guys.

18:56.234 --> 18:57.199
Hello?

18:57.234 --> 18:59.466
Hey. It's me.

18:59.501 --> 19:02.167
Listen, I, uh, I got
some more cabbage for you.

19:02.202 --> 19:04.634
Oh, uh, great.
Um, why don't--

19:04.669 --> 19:05.767
I'll tell you what.

19:05.802 --> 19:07.602
Why don't you leave it
on your kitchen counter,

19:07.637 --> 19:09.019
and I'll grab it
in the morning?

19:09.054 --> 19:10.644
You all right?
You sound a little--

19:10.679 --> 19:12.073
No, no. Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.

19:12.108 --> 19:13.588
It's just
Connor's got a cold.

19:13.623 --> 19:15.068
I'm up to my ass
in dirty laundry.

19:15.103 --> 19:16.903
- It's insane.
- Hey...

19:16.938 --> 19:18.568
What?

19:18.603 --> 19:20.703
I just wanted to tell you
that, uh, I'm sorry.

19:22.169 --> 19:23.836
Sorry for what?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.334
I--

19:25.369 --> 19:27.102
I, you know, I think
maybe sometimes I--

19:27.137 --> 19:29.670
I don't give you
enough credit

19:29.705 --> 19:32.168
for, uh, what you do,
you know?

19:32.203 --> 19:34.704
I mean, just the way
things happened to shake out,

19:34.739 --> 19:36.602
you ended up, you know...

19:36.637 --> 19:38.570
Being in charge of most
of the responsibilities

19:38.605 --> 19:40.903
when it came
to the kids, and I--

19:40.938 --> 19:43.204
I think that was just
dropped in your lap.

19:43.239 --> 19:45.471
I just wanted to let you know
that, you know,

19:45.506 --> 19:47.271
I think you're doing...

19:47.306 --> 19:49.037
a great job, and, uh...

19:49.072 --> 19:50.671
You know, maybe--

19:50.706 --> 19:53.839
I haven't been giving you
enough credit for that recently,

19:53.874 --> 19:55.070
you know...

19:55.105 --> 19:57.405
For-- for a while.

20:00.239 --> 20:01.689
Hello?

20:01.724 --> 20:03.104
Yeah.

20:03.139 --> 20:04.589
Thank you.

20:04.624 --> 20:05.881
Thanks, Tommy.

20:05.916 --> 20:07.104
I gotta go.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.305
All right. All right.
I'll, uh...

20:09.340 --> 20:11.340
I'll leave the money
on the kitchen counter for you,

20:11.375 --> 20:12.524
all right?

20:12.559 --> 20:13.674
Thanks.

20:17.508 --> 20:20.573
So listen, I just...

20:20.608 --> 20:22.339
I've just come
out of this, like,

20:22.374 --> 20:23.841
this really long-term
relationship thing.

20:23.876 --> 20:25.642
How long?

20:25.677 --> 20:27.126
Um, uh...

20:27.161 --> 20:28.540
Long.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.658
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Yeah.

20:31.693 --> 20:34.707
I-- I really, really like you.

20:34.742 --> 20:37.343
Yeah, I could tell
the other night.

20:38.643 --> 20:41.093
Um, the thing is, though,
I just--

20:41.128 --> 20:43.543
I think you're too great
a person

20:43.578 --> 20:44.576
to be like a rebound

20:44.611 --> 20:45.775
thing for me.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.210
So I think that
we should, you know...

20:48.245 --> 20:49.894
I don't know.

20:49.929 --> 20:51.653
Just-- just be...

20:51.688 --> 20:53.377
Friends, yeah?

20:54.777 --> 20:56.377
I can't believe
you just said that.

20:56.412 --> 20:57.711
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

20:57.746 --> 20:58.677
No, no, no.

20:58.712 --> 20:59.845
It's just that I've--

21:01.111 --> 21:03.194
I've been dating such idiots
lately,

21:03.229 --> 21:05.278
and you're just so cute
and funny.

21:05.313 --> 21:07.677
I totally agree.

21:07.712 --> 21:09.044
We should keep
seeing each other.

21:09.079 --> 21:10.077
We'll take it slow,

21:10.112 --> 21:13.179
and whatever happens,
happens, right?

21:13.214 --> 21:14.312
Right.

21:15.546 --> 21:19.746
God, you're so special.

21:19.781 --> 21:20.946
Um...

21:20.981 --> 21:23.280
Could you--

21:23.315 --> 21:25.580
Oh, God!

21:25.615 --> 21:26.680
Oh!

21:35.815 --> 21:37.531
Come on, Red!
Come on, Red!

21:37.566 --> 21:39.423
Let's get it going here!

21:39.458 --> 21:41.281
All right, listen up!

21:41.316 --> 21:43.547
Hey, shut up!

21:43.582 --> 21:44.747
All right, here's the game plan.

21:44.782 --> 21:46.113
I got these guys
perfectly positioned.

21:46.148 --> 21:47.965
They're pissed off
to the nth degree, all right?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.782
They're gonna chop at us.
They're gonna stick us.

21:49.817 --> 21:51.183
They're gonna drop their gloves.

21:51.218 --> 21:52.549
We're not gonna respond, okay?

21:52.584 --> 21:53.814
Nobody responds.

21:53.849 --> 21:55.048
No fighting. Nothing.

21:55.083 --> 21:57.717
We take the power play.
We get a nice, big, fat lead,

21:57.752 --> 21:59.817
and then and only then
do I unleash the hounds.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.467
You got it?

22:01.502 --> 22:03.048
Got it.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.348
- Hey, Mungo.
- Yeah?

22:04.383 --> 22:05.450
Aren't you gonna wear pads?

22:05.485 --> 22:06.784
Pads are for pussies.

22:06.819 --> 22:08.082
All right.

22:08.117 --> 22:10.284
Uh, what about a helmet,
there, pal?

22:10.319 --> 22:12.249
Helmets are for pussies.

22:12.284 --> 22:13.684
Yeah, but I think
it's a rule.

22:13.719 --> 22:14.683
Come on, man.

22:14.718 --> 22:16.316
Yeah, yeah.
Rules are for pussies.

22:16.351 --> 22:18.151
All right, guys.
Let's go kick some ass. FDNY!

22:18.186 --> 22:19.085
Huh!

22:20.585 --> 22:22.185
You ladies ready for a whippin'?

22:22.220 --> 22:23.517
What's that, asshole?

22:23.552 --> 22:25.151
You ready
to get your ass kicked?

22:25.186 --> 22:26.519
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.650
Yeah, okay.

22:27.685 --> 22:29.486
The guy without the helmet,
is that Mungo Monahan?

22:29.521 --> 22:30.651
Yeah.

22:30.686 --> 22:32.051
He wasn't on the roster
last time.

22:32.086 --> 22:33.887
Yeah, he was.
He just had a little tummyache.

22:33.922 --> 22:35.151
Bullshit.

22:35.186 --> 22:37.202
Gonna tell number 8
he's gotta wear a helmet?

22:37.237 --> 22:39.219
Just drop the goddamn puck,
will you? Let's go.

22:39.254 --> 22:41.687
They ain't paying me enough.
Let's go.

22:49.621 --> 22:50.820
Oh, come on!

22:50.855 --> 22:53.388
Hey, hey,
look at that, huh?

22:53.423 --> 22:54.520
You little bitch.

22:54.555 --> 22:55.755
Let's go.
You're in the box.

22:55.790 --> 22:56.753
Bye-bye!

22:56.788 --> 22:58.220
Collins, P.D.,

22:58.255 --> 23:01.121
two minutes cross-checking,
two minutes roughing.

23:01.156 --> 23:02.354
Get in the box.

23:02.389 --> 23:03.756
That's a bullshit call.

23:23.223 --> 23:24.156
Yeah!

23:33.024 --> 23:34.591
Come in. It's open.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.375
Goddamn mailman.

23:38.410 --> 23:39.959
He's as deaf as a--

23:39.994 --> 23:41.158
deaf person.

23:44.492 --> 23:45.893
Hey. You.

23:45.928 --> 23:47.425
Hey.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.658
Phyllis ain't here.

23:49.693 --> 23:52.326
I know. She's at my place.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.391
Well, you've got my wife.

23:55.426 --> 23:57.926
I don't know what else
you could possibly need.

23:57.961 --> 24:00.427
She wanted me to come over here
and talk to you.

24:00.462 --> 24:03.361
Okay.

24:03.396 --> 24:06.226
Um...

24:06.261 --> 24:07.995
You want something
to drink? Anything?

24:08.030 --> 24:10.462
A shot of whiskey
would be great.

24:10.497 --> 24:12.246
Shot of whiskey.

24:12.281 --> 24:13.961
Interesting.

24:13.996 --> 24:16.126
She was all happy.

24:16.161 --> 24:17.961
You know, she said
she wanted to take it slow.

24:17.996 --> 24:19.879
Well, you must've said
the wrong thing, dude.

24:19.914 --> 24:21.728
No, I said exactly
what you told me to say.

24:21.763 --> 24:23.963
I don't know what happened.
She threw me under the bus.

24:23.998 --> 24:24.963
Well, try
something else.

24:27.539 --> 24:29.464
Oh, yeah, try something else.
Like what?

24:29.509 --> 24:31.118
- Tell her you're gay.
- What?

24:31.162 --> 24:32.979
You want to get rid
of this chick or not?

24:33.014 --> 24:34.797
The gay thing is a definite
deal breaker.

24:34.832 --> 24:36.629
All right, I'll try it.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.133
When you're talking
about bad kisser,

24:38.193 --> 24:40.389
you're talking about
"too much saliva" bad kisser

24:40.449 --> 24:42.964
or "using your tongue like
an iguana eating a fly"

24:42.999 --> 24:44.330
bad kisser?

24:44.365 --> 24:47.348
Hey, I used to be
a player.

24:47.383 --> 24:50.331
That was
disturbing, chief.

24:50.366 --> 24:51.897
Yeah, and disgusting.

24:51.932 --> 24:53.865
You should've saw the chick
that I did it with.

25:02.466 --> 25:04.097
Way to go!

25:04.132 --> 25:05.364
What do you think, huh?

25:05.399 --> 25:06.665
Hey, time to unleash
the hounds?

25:06.700 --> 25:08.700
You know what? It is time
to unleash the hounds.

25:08.735 --> 25:09.799
Let's go.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.433
Not you. Finesse part
of the game's over.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.151
Mungo, come on.

25:13.186 --> 25:14.834
Come on, guys, go!

25:18.234 --> 25:19.734
Um, I've never
done this before,

25:19.769 --> 25:21.385
so you'll have to excuse me--

25:21.420 --> 25:23.002
Busy day.
Let's move it along.

25:23.037 --> 25:25.132
Okay.

25:25.167 --> 25:26.568
Phyllis wants a divorce.

25:30.302 --> 25:31.335
You okay, Ken?

25:31.370 --> 25:33.402
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:33.437 --> 25:35.435
Have another shot.

25:35.470 --> 25:36.601
Thanks.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.667
Keep talking.
I can hear you.

25:38.702 --> 25:41.069
I know this must be hard
for you--

25:41.104 --> 25:45.902
Yes, yes, yes,
very hard.

25:45.937 --> 25:48.103
She-- she couldn't
bring herself to--

25:48.138 --> 25:49.802
She felt as if--

25:49.837 --> 25:52.037
She came here, that I would've
talked her out of it.

25:52.072 --> 25:54.404
That's exactly what she said.

25:54.439 --> 25:56.804
Well, I know my wife.

25:56.839 --> 25:58.736
Your girlfriend.

25:58.771 --> 26:01.238
Whatever the hell she is.

26:01.273 --> 26:03.705
She want to keep the house?

26:03.740 --> 26:05.971
I think, actually,

26:06.006 --> 26:07.972
she just wants to move--

26:08.007 --> 26:09.103
In with you?

26:09.138 --> 26:11.438
Yeah, we talked about--

26:11.473 --> 26:12.672
You need boxes?

26:14.651 --> 26:17.256
I don't know, man.
I've been hearing stuff from people.

26:17.339 --> 26:18.754
I've seen them together
a couple times.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.218
- You know, something's not right.
- No, there's no way, Frank.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.671
That would be so wrong.

26:22.774 --> 26:25.234
Yeah, well, remember who
you're talking about, huh?

26:25.289 --> 26:25.814
Yeah.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.036
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

26:28.082 --> 26:30.444
Come on, give it up.
What are you talking about?

26:30.486 --> 26:32.464
Tommy and Jimmy's widow.

26:32.534 --> 26:34.556
- You know anything?
- No.

26:34.674 --> 26:36.275
Maybe Tommy'll take
a puck in the head

26:36.310 --> 26:38.241
and knock some sense
into him.

26:38.276 --> 26:40.909
Come here,
come here!

26:51.409 --> 26:53.140
Ladies?

26:53.175 --> 26:55.809
Ladies first,
ladies first!

27:09.912 --> 27:11.245
Good call on Mungo, dude.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.745
Did he hit that guy
or what?

27:12.780 --> 27:14.176
Anytime you need me,
man.

27:14.211 --> 27:15.576
Hey, whoa, shut up,
whoa, whoa, hey!

27:15.611 --> 27:17.211
Hey, ladies,
are you coming out,

27:17.246 --> 27:19.211
or do we have to come in
and get you?

27:19.246 --> 27:20.762
Come on, Gavin!

27:20.797 --> 27:22.279
Get out here!

27:22.314 --> 27:23.312
Come on!

27:39.380 --> 27:40.945
Teddy, what's wrong?

27:40.980 --> 27:43.381
I mean, you haven't talked
since we left the track.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.646
Oh, you're unbelievable.

27:45.681 --> 27:47.697
You told me the 4 horse
was gonna win.

27:47.732 --> 27:49.623
You said he spoke to you,
he felt fine,

27:49.658 --> 27:51.514
he had just had
a nice bucket of oats.

27:51.549 --> 27:52.479
You're upset.

27:52.514 --> 27:54.814
You're damn right I'm upset!

27:54.849 --> 27:56.815
I put 10 grand on that horse,
Arlo!

27:56.850 --> 27:58.347
You let me down!

27:58.382 --> 28:00.048
I don't have
any special talents, Teddy.

28:01.882 --> 28:02.847
What?

28:02.882 --> 28:04.549
All those races
I won?

28:04.584 --> 28:06.181
It was luck, just luck.

28:06.216 --> 28:11.116
You mean you really can't
talk to the horses?

28:11.151 --> 28:12.049
You lied to me?

28:13.716 --> 28:15.017
I guess so.

28:15.052 --> 28:16.181
Why?

28:16.216 --> 28:19.018
Because I liked
being here with you.

28:19.053 --> 28:21.083
This is a nice house.

28:21.118 --> 28:23.549
I love you.

28:23.584 --> 28:25.784
And that's supposed
to make me feel better

28:25.819 --> 28:27.402
about losing 10 grand?

28:27.437 --> 28:28.950
I don't think so, Arlo.

28:28.985 --> 28:31.385
And that "I love you"
only covers the first 50 bucks.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.686
Teddy, listen to me.

28:33.721 --> 28:35.917
I really love you.

28:35.952 --> 28:38.202
Ah, you're pulling my leg.

28:38.237 --> 28:40.294
Why couldn't we be together?

28:40.329 --> 28:42.317
I mean, I could make you happy.

28:42.352 --> 28:48.753
When you say make me happy,
you mean as in sexually?

28:48.788 --> 28:50.050
What do you think?

28:50.085 --> 28:51.736
There are some things
that I could do

28:51.771 --> 28:53.387
that could really
make you feel--

28:53.422 --> 28:56.787
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

28:56.822 --> 29:00.185
Absolutely not.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.385
What kind of things?

29:01.420 --> 29:04.187
Well, I could get a box
about eight inches high

29:04.222 --> 29:05.988
and stand on it
and I could, you know--

29:06.023 --> 29:08.054
No, no, no!

29:08.089 --> 29:09.205
Arlo--

29:09.240 --> 29:10.286
Kiss me.

29:10.321 --> 29:12.155
No, no, that's it!
Game over, got it?

29:12.190 --> 29:13.989
Tell your story walking,
short stuff.

29:14.024 --> 29:15.287
Get out of my house!

29:15.322 --> 29:19.072
Pack all your stuff up
and get out of here.

29:19.107 --> 29:22.822
How can a guy so big
have a heart so small?

29:28.957 --> 29:32.121
See, the thing is, Carol, um--

29:32.156 --> 29:34.890
God, boy, I don't know
how to say this.

29:34.925 --> 29:36.157
Well, take your time.

29:36.192 --> 29:37.808
Okay.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.389
Um...

29:39.424 --> 29:42.390
I'm, um, gay.

29:42.425 --> 29:45.357
I had a feeling.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.423
Excuse me?

29:47.458 --> 29:49.692
Well, I saw that calendar.
How gay was that?

29:49.727 --> 29:51.109
And I asked
a gay friend of mine,

29:51.144 --> 29:52.492
and he said that
that handkerchief

29:52.527 --> 29:53.590
in your back pocket

29:53.625 --> 29:55.026
was an indication
you were really into--

29:55.061 --> 29:56.190
You know what?
Never mind that.

29:56.225 --> 29:58.742
It's just that what
I'm trying to say is--

29:58.777 --> 30:01.259
Wait a second.
How could you think I was gay?

30:01.294 --> 30:04.027
Well, for starters, the hair,
the walk,

30:04.062 --> 30:06.226
- the pants--
- My pants?

30:06.261 --> 30:07.391
Whoa.

30:07.426 --> 30:09.091
Listen, the point is

30:09.126 --> 30:13.028
I think that that's the reason
why we can't--

30:13.063 --> 30:17.227
Rush into things, I know.
I got it.

30:17.262 --> 30:18.844
Yeah, listen--

30:18.879 --> 30:21.404
You're gay!

30:21.439 --> 30:23.894
You're gay!

30:23.929 --> 30:26.178
Now I know why you're
such a terrible kisser.

30:26.213 --> 30:28.428
You've never done it
with a woman before!

30:34.229 --> 30:36.195
Good job.

30:36.246 --> 30:37.629
Excuse me.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.679
Uh, aren't you--?
You're Tommy's cousin, right?

30:39.744 --> 30:41.770
- Right, right. Franco?
- How are you?

30:41.804 --> 30:43.246
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Good to see you.

30:43.296 --> 30:45.530
Yeah, I didn't recognize you
without the thing.

30:45.565 --> 30:47.529
Oh. Who's this?

30:47.564 --> 30:48.829
Oh, this is my daughter
Keela.

30:48.864 --> 30:51.230
Hey, Keela.
I'm Mickey. How are you?

30:51.265 --> 30:52.729
Good.

30:52.764 --> 30:54.247
Good, good!

30:54.282 --> 30:55.696
I had no idea.

30:55.731 --> 30:58.081
Oh, yeah, me neither.

30:58.116 --> 31:00.431
So how's Tom doing? Good?

31:00.466 --> 31:02.196
You tell me.

31:02.231 --> 31:05.398
To tell you the truth,
you don't want to know.

31:05.433 --> 31:07.299
We'll see you.

31:07.334 --> 31:10.731
Yeah.

31:10.766 --> 31:13.365
Come on, sweetie, I want to talk
to this man for a second.

31:14.599 --> 31:16.230
Mrs. Reilly,

31:16.265 --> 31:19.133
I'm gonna ask you
to memorize five words.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.466
You ready?

31:20.501 --> 31:22.483
Sure.

31:22.518 --> 31:24.059
Apple.

31:24.094 --> 31:25.680
Driver.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.007
Sweetly.

31:27.042 --> 31:28.171
Queen.

31:28.206 --> 31:30.503
Happiness.

31:30.538 --> 31:32.169
Apple.

31:32.204 --> 31:33.652
Driver.

31:33.687 --> 31:35.100
Sweetly.

31:36.467 --> 31:37.800
Queen.

31:37.835 --> 31:39.134
Happiness.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.100
Good.

31:40.135 --> 31:42.036
Apple, driver, sweetly,

31:42.071 --> 31:43.534
queen, happiness.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.302
Just remember them
for me, okay?

31:46.337 --> 31:48.069
Tell me about your husband.

31:48.104 --> 31:49.802
What does he do
for a living?

31:49.837 --> 31:51.701
- He's a firefighter.
- Oh.

31:51.736 --> 31:53.670
That's a dangerous profession.

31:53.705 --> 31:55.134
You worry about him?

31:55.169 --> 31:59.003
I do worry, but he's been at it
as long as I've known him

31:59.038 --> 32:01.704
and he's always been fine.

32:01.739 --> 32:03.771
That's very interesting.

32:03.806 --> 32:05.804
What were those five words?

32:05.839 --> 32:08.235
Five words?

32:08.270 --> 32:10.004
Yeah, I asked you
to remember five words.

32:10.039 --> 32:11.470
Can you tell me what they are?

32:12.270 --> 32:15.403
I don't--

32:15.438 --> 32:17.305
Can you remember
any of them?

32:17.340 --> 32:18.872
One?

32:27.573 --> 32:28.739
Hey.

32:30.105 --> 32:31.406
What's going on?

32:36.072 --> 32:38.156
What the hell's eating him?

32:38.191 --> 32:40.240
The guys want
to talk to you.

32:40.275 --> 32:41.472
About what?

32:41.507 --> 32:42.440
I think you know.

32:49.474 --> 32:51.374
We've got solid proof, Tommy.
Real solid.

32:51.409 --> 32:52.673
Really.
What've you got?

32:52.708 --> 32:54.808
You know, we don't want
to get into that right now.

32:54.843 --> 32:56.908
You did it, and now you gotta
pay the consequences.

32:56.943 --> 32:58.575
Yeah, I don't think
you guys have any right

32:58.610 --> 33:00.209
being involved in
my personal business.

33:00.244 --> 33:01.809
You can't mess with
any of the widows.

33:01.844 --> 33:02.774
You know that.

33:02.809 --> 33:03.841
I warned you.

33:03.876 --> 33:05.275
Christ, Tommy, I tried
talking to you,

33:05.310 --> 33:06.374
but you just
wouldn't listen.

33:06.409 --> 33:08.709
My wife's at the hospital
right now

33:08.744 --> 33:10.174
having some tests done.

33:10.209 --> 33:12.209
I don't know what the hell's
gonna happen to her.

33:12.244 --> 33:14.127
You think I need to put up
with your bullshit?

33:14.162 --> 33:16.010
Look, if you guys
are gonna throw a beating,

33:16.045 --> 33:17.174
might as well throw it now

33:17.209 --> 33:19.209
before we get a call
and it spoils your fun.

33:19.244 --> 33:20.911
Oh, you think we're
enjoying this, Tom?

33:20.946 --> 33:22.578
You think any of us
want to be here?

33:22.613 --> 33:24.078
Then why are we doing it?

33:24.113 --> 33:25.544
Because we have to...

33:25.579 --> 33:27.476
For Jimmy.

33:27.511 --> 33:28.809
Because he was our brother.

33:28.844 --> 33:30.743
It's out of respect
for his memory, Tommy,

33:30.778 --> 33:33.111
which you clearly
don't give a rat's ass about.

33:33.146 --> 33:36.979
Now, do you love her?

33:37.014 --> 33:38.879
I don't know.

33:38.914 --> 33:40.745
I'm sorry, Tom.

33:44.546 --> 33:45.513
Damn!

33:48.279 --> 33:50.444
What about you, probie?

33:50.479 --> 33:52.013
Or are you too much of a pussy?

33:54.613 --> 33:55.646
Whoa, Mikey!

33:55.681 --> 33:57.113
Take it easy.
Take it easy!

33:57.148 --> 33:58.212
Easy, man, easy!

33:58.247 --> 34:01.130
You ever say anything
about my girlfriend again,

34:01.165 --> 34:03.539
one goddamn word,
one goddamn more fat joke,

34:03.574 --> 34:05.914
I'll come after you
10 times as hard, asshole.

34:05.949 --> 34:07.246
Yeah, yeah.

34:07.281 --> 34:10.715
That goes for all of you.

34:13.748 --> 34:15.514
- Tommy, you gotta give her up.
- I can't.

34:15.549 --> 34:17.281
You gotta.
I mean, you don't love her.

34:17.315 --> 34:19.947
I can't do it.

34:19.983 --> 34:21.666
- Cut her loose, Tom!
- Give her up, Tommy.

34:21.701 --> 34:23.349
It's Jimmy's wife,
for Christ's sake!

34:23.384 --> 34:25.114
How can you do that?

34:25.149 --> 34:26.949
Want us to break our hands
beating your ass?

34:26.985 --> 34:27.882
She's pregnant.

34:29.483 --> 34:30.449
Shit.

34:40.117 --> 34:41.251
Clean him up.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.083
It's not what you think, Lou.

34:50.119 --> 34:51.049
Hmm...

34:51.083 --> 34:53.351
What I think?

34:54.985 --> 34:57.586
What I think, goddamn.

34:57.621 --> 35:01.551
T, after 9/11,

35:01.586 --> 35:07.920
after our four guys
and the other 52 guys I knew,

35:07.955 --> 35:09.919
52...

35:09.954 --> 35:14.487
52 guys
I came out of the academy with,

35:14.522 --> 35:19.021
spent two or 10 years
working with,

35:19.056 --> 35:21.553
was best man at their marriage

35:21.588 --> 35:24.888
and godfather to their kids
with, with, with, with...

35:24.923 --> 35:27.722
What I think?

35:29.355 --> 35:31.972
Everybody should do
whatever the hell they want,

35:32.007 --> 35:36.165
and they should do a goddamn lot
of it right now,

35:36.200 --> 35:40.323
because tomorrow,
my friend, ain't no guarantee.

35:40.358 --> 35:44.057
Birth, school, work, death.

35:44.092 --> 35:45.556
It goes that quick.

35:45.591 --> 35:47.089
Yeah.

35:54.424 --> 35:58.489
I tell you, man,

35:58.524 --> 36:04.258
every time I walk into a room
to talk to my wife,

36:04.293 --> 36:11.526
I'm surrounded by disappointment
and...

36:11.561 --> 36:16.391
acrimony and disbelief.

36:16.426 --> 36:20.724
The air's just, like,
dripping with it, you know?

36:20.759 --> 36:24.460
It just reminds me of the way
it used to be, you know?

36:24.495 --> 36:28.158
Come home from a tour
safe and sound,

36:28.193 --> 36:32.493
and she'd grab me
by the back of the neck.

36:32.528 --> 36:34.094
She'd grab, like,
the back of my neck

36:34.129 --> 36:37.461
and my ass at the same time

36:37.496 --> 36:40.359
and just kiss me.

36:40.394 --> 36:45.360
I mean, really kiss me,
you know?

36:45.395 --> 36:46.961
And that's what I have
with Sheila, man.

36:46.996 --> 36:51.596
Every time I walk in the door,
she can't get enough of me.

36:58.129 --> 37:03.196
I remember the morning
of Jimmy's funeral.

37:06.464 --> 37:10.697
I pull up to his dad's house
and put the car in park,

37:10.732 --> 37:14.931
and Janet turns to me and says--
I'll never forget this.

37:14.966 --> 37:18.096
She goes, "God, I hate
seeing Jimmy's parents.

37:18.131 --> 37:22.665
You know, they've always been
so judgmental of me."

37:26.799 --> 37:30.499
I said, "They're burying
their oldest child today,

37:30.534 --> 37:32.665
"their only son.

37:32.824 --> 37:35.915
"The last thing they're thinking about
is what they think of you."

37:37.600 --> 37:41.734
Didn't have sex
for three months after that.

37:44.667 --> 37:48.432
That's the goddamn thing, Lou.

37:48.467 --> 37:51.232
Yeah, I tell you,
I hang out with Sheila,

37:51.267 --> 37:54.301
and it's just like we feel
the same way about everything,

37:54.336 --> 37:56.868
about life, about death,

37:56.903 --> 37:59.401
about Jimmy, about...

38:01.501 --> 38:03.618
I mean, I don't know
if I love her, Lou.

38:03.653 --> 38:05.736
I don't know what that means
anymore,

38:05.771 --> 38:07.169
but I like being with her, man.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.587
It's fun.

38:08.622 --> 38:09.935
We laugh,

38:09.970 --> 38:12.634
sometimes we cry,

38:12.669 --> 38:16.503
but goddamn, it's a lot of fun,
you know?

38:16.538 --> 38:20.337
It's like we're on
the exact same page.

38:20.372 --> 38:21.337
You know what I mean?

38:21.372 --> 38:23.537
Yeah.

38:25.905 --> 38:27.738
You gotta tell me
how you found out, Lou.

38:29.938 --> 38:31.605
You owe me this one,
brother.

38:51.673 --> 38:52.872
Hey, cap, have the NPO

38:52.907 --> 38:54.707
charge this soft connection,
all right,

38:54.742 --> 38:56.341
so we can get this going.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.492
Battalion 1-5 to Manhattan,

38:58.527 --> 39:00.573
transmit a 1075 to box 35-33,

39:00.608 --> 39:02.624
fully involved on the top floor,
explosion,

39:02.659 --> 39:04.641
we're gonna need an additional
tower ladder

39:04.676 --> 39:06.041
to cut a hole in the roof.

39:07.708 --> 39:08.873
We're clear in the back.

39:08.908 --> 39:11.173
All right.
6-2-R, this is 6-2.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.241
Primary search negative
on the second floor.

39:13.276 --> 39:14.206
10-4.

39:14.241 --> 39:15.440
Go down to the main floor,

39:15.475 --> 39:17.642
see if Franco and Sean
need a hand.

39:17.677 --> 39:20.009
Got it.
Let's go.

39:23.910 --> 39:25.174
What are you doing?

39:25.209 --> 39:29.242
I thought I heard something
in there.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.367
- We already checked that room.
- Give me two seconds.

39:41.143 --> 39:42.475
You son of a bitch!

39:42.510 --> 39:44.627
You let me die,
you selfish prick.

39:44.662 --> 39:46.710
Why didn't you save me,
Tommy, huh?

39:46.745 --> 39:49.745
You saved yourself, but not me,
not anybody else.

39:49.780 --> 39:51.545
Why'd you make us
go away?

39:51.580 --> 39:53.311
I thought you
liked us, Tommy.

39:53.346 --> 39:54.276
Nobody likes you anymore.

39:54.311 --> 39:55.512
You asshole.
Did you really think

39:55.547 --> 39:57.080
you'd get rid of all of us?

39:57.115 --> 39:59.147
Tommy!

39:59.182 --> 40:01.144
Let's go!

40:01.179 --> 40:02.578
- What are you doing?
- What?

40:02.613 --> 40:04.013
The ceiling doesn't
look good in here.

40:04.048 --> 40:05.245
Come on.

40:07.347 --> 40:08.863
You piece of shit.

40:08.898 --> 40:10.345
You live and I die?

40:10.380 --> 40:12.111
- Tommy!
- How is that fair?

40:12.146 --> 40:14.347
What do you have to offer
to any living person?

40:14.382 --> 40:15.312
Nothing!

40:15.347 --> 40:17.597
Your whole life is shit!

40:17.632 --> 40:19.848
Franco! Franco, on two!

40:19.883 --> 40:21.013
What's wrong?

40:21.048 --> 40:22.613
I need help up here!

40:22.648 --> 40:24.331
- What? What is it?
- It's Tommy.

40:24.366 --> 40:26.040
I can't get him
out of this room.

40:26.075 --> 40:27.715
- What, is he hurt?
- I don't know.

40:29.549 --> 40:31.347
Die, Tommy.

40:31.382 --> 40:33.349
What good are you?

40:33.384 --> 40:35.100
Tommy,

40:35.135 --> 40:36.781
you okay?

40:36.816 --> 40:39.849
You're deader than all of us
combined, you pathetic shit.

40:41.283 --> 40:42.783
Tommy!

40:45.183 --> 40:46.448
We gotta go!

40:46.483 --> 40:47.582
Okay, okay, yeah.

40:47.617 --> 40:48.582
Get the Halligan, man--

40:48.617 --> 40:49.815
Yeah, yeah,
hey, we're cool.

40:49.850 --> 40:51.918
Just make sure he gets
all the way downstairs.

40:52.918 --> 40:56.284
Jesus Christ, Frankie!

40:56.319 --> 40:57.816
Oh, shit!

40:57.851 --> 41:00.251
Get help, get help quick!

41:00.286 --> 41:02.651
Man down!
Man down on two!

41:02.686 --> 41:04.986
Frank, get up!

41:48.456 --> 41:50.754
What happened
up there, Gavin?

41:50.789 --> 41:52.723
Laura and I went up.
We did a sweep.

41:52.758 --> 41:54.854
I thought
I heard something,

41:54.889 --> 41:56.721
and we went back in.
What did she say?

41:56.756 --> 42:01.091
She didn't say much, only
that you seemed disoriented.

42:02.657 --> 42:03.755
Yeah, right.

42:03.790 --> 42:04.922
It doesn't
look good, Tom.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.924
You have this disagreement
with Franco,

42:06.959 --> 42:08.423
next thing
he's in intensive care

42:08.458 --> 42:09.522
fighting for his life.

42:09.557 --> 42:12.224
You guys accusing me
of something?

42:12.259 --> 42:14.157
Figure it out, Einstein.

42:14.192 --> 42:15.690
What?

42:15.725 --> 42:18.558
Let's just say you're not
the most popular crew member

42:18.593 --> 42:19.523
on the floor.

42:19.558 --> 42:20.690
Here's the deal,
Tommy.

42:20.725 --> 42:23.075
You gotta clean up your act
as of right now.

42:23.110 --> 42:25.217
We catch you drinking
on the job, you're gone.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.325
You're caught even
talking to Jimmy's widow,

42:27.360 --> 42:28.657
saying hello to her,

42:28.692 --> 42:30.792
buying her a birthday card,
anything, you're gone.

42:30.827 --> 42:32.593
We've had enough bullshit
around here--

42:32.628 --> 42:34.360
I got 20 goddamn years
in this house, pal.

42:34.395 --> 42:36.992
20 goddamn years.

42:37.027 --> 42:38.627
You guys pull this shit
on me now?

42:38.662 --> 42:39.593
That's about it.

42:43.860 --> 42:45.761
All right, I want a transfer.

42:45.796 --> 42:47.092
Tommy, hold--

42:47.127 --> 42:49.961
No, I want a transfer
out of this house right now.

42:52.394 --> 42:53.327
Thanks, Jer.

43:10.063 --> 43:11.429
Excuse me.

43:19.397 --> 43:20.696
Go ahead.

43:20.731 --> 43:24.831
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned,

43:24.866 --> 43:25.864
and so have you!

43:40.099 --> 43:43.332
How dare you repeat anything
I say to you to anybody else!

43:43.367 --> 43:44.683
You're my priest!

43:44.718 --> 43:45.965
I'm your cousin.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Not anymore, asshole.

46:53.810 --> 46:56.810
