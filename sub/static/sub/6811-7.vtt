00:05.727 --> 00:08.861
I didn't know where the needle came from,

00:08.863 --> 00:10.930
and I didn't care.

00:13.034 --> 00:15.101
All I knew is that I didn't want

00:15.103 --> 00:17.236
to feel this pain anymore.

00:17.238 --> 00:20.606
Just that warm, familiar comfort,

00:20.608 --> 00:22.642
singing inside my blood.

00:22.644 --> 00:23.976
You feel like the weight of the world

00:23.978 --> 00:26.312
is on your shoulders?

00:26.314 --> 00:28.915
Like there is no light
at the end of the tunnel?

00:30.318 --> 00:33.886
Then let A&O Life Success Seminars

00:33.888 --> 00:37.890
build a better you with
just three magic words.

00:37.892 --> 00:40.960
Take life now! Take life now!

00:40.962 --> 00:44.163
Take life now! Take life now!

00:44.165 --> 00:45.932
Take life now!

00:45.934 --> 00:49.068
Take life now! Take life now!

00:49.070 --> 00:52.638
Take life now! Take life now!

00:52.640 --> 00:54.173
Take life now!

00:54.175 --> 00:57.343
Take life now! Take life now!

00:57.345 --> 00:58.678
Whoo! All: Take life now!

00:58.680 --> 01:00.079
- Yeah!
- Whoo, whoo!

01:00.081 --> 01:02.114
- That's right, folks.
- Whoo!

01:02.116 --> 01:05.084
Seize your destiny.

01:05.086 --> 01:08.921
Let A&O help make your dreams come true.

01:08.923 --> 01:14.260
Now, maybe you're thinking
it can't happen to you.

01:14.262 --> 01:17.863
Or maybe you're thinking
that you're just born to lose.

01:17.865 --> 01:20.266
Mm-mm-mm.

01:20.268 --> 01:23.035
You, sir.

01:23.037 --> 01:24.503
What's your name?

01:24.505 --> 01:26.138
David.

01:26.140 --> 01:27.540
Okay.

01:27.542 --> 01:30.810
Well, tell me... before you came to A&O,

01:30.812 --> 01:35.014
you were a boozer, a user, a loser.

01:35.016 --> 01:36.816
Does that sound about right?

01:39.654 --> 01:41.020
Come on up here.

01:41.022 --> 01:42.288
Come on!

01:53.201 --> 01:55.468
What the hell?

01:55.470 --> 01:57.737
It's okay.

01:57.739 --> 01:59.405
You're okay.

01:59.407 --> 02:02.408
You see, a long time ago,
I was just like David.

02:02.410 --> 02:07.213
I let everyone else's
problems become my problems.

02:07.215 --> 02:09.848
Just dragging me down with 'em.

02:09.851 --> 02:11.984
You have people like
that in your life, David?

02:11.986 --> 02:15.087
Just feeding off you like a leech?

02:15.089 --> 02:18.357
I don't... I don't know.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.993
Do you have any family?

02:20.995 --> 02:22.328
- Sister.
- Oh!

02:22.330 --> 02:24.263
You hear that? It's his sister.

02:24.265 --> 02:27.199
- No. That's not what I meant.
- We all know the type.

02:27.201 --> 02:28.534
It's our family.

02:28.536 --> 02:30.403
It's our so-called friends

02:30.405 --> 02:33.739
that we try to help but
only get us into trouble.

02:33.741 --> 02:36.676
Well, that stops right here.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.912
We need to find our own success

02:39.914 --> 02:43.349
before we can succeed
in helping anyone else.

02:43.351 --> 02:45.851
You need to learn how to take life now!

02:58.132 --> 03:00.199
Say it, David.

03:00.201 --> 03:04.036
Come on. Feels good.

03:04.038 --> 03:07.440
- Say it, David!
- Come on, David.

03:07.442 --> 03:08.808
Take life now.

03:08.810 --> 03:10.710
- Yes, take it.
- Yeah, take life.

03:13.281 --> 03:14.780
Take life now!

03:25.560 --> 03:28.728
Take life now! Take life now!

03:28.730 --> 03:30.496
Take life now! Take life now!

03:30.498 --> 03:33.432
I have a feeling he's
going to do great things.

03:33.434 --> 03:37.236
Take life now! Take life now!

03:37.238 --> 03:40.239
Take life now. Take life now.

03:40.241 --> 03:42.475
Take life now.

05:01.876 --> 05:04.610
Gracie!

05:08.917 --> 05:10.917
Oh, no.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.586
You're hurting yourself. Stop!

05:13.888 --> 05:15.521
I hate you.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.690
I hate you!

Gracie!

05:23.965 --> 05:27.066
Gracie!

05:30.038 --> 05:31.704
Ba... baby, I'm so...

05:31.706 --> 05:34.307
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:36.577 --> 05:39.145
Please believe me... I never
meant for you to get hurt.

05:39.147 --> 05:40.813
Mom said you were a good man.

05:40.815 --> 05:42.815
Maybe not good enough.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.246
David!

06:20.588 --> 06:22.521
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:22.523 --> 06:23.589
I've been calling you all night.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.124
I know.

06:25.126 --> 06:27.693
I'm sorry I just ran out on you like that.

06:27.695 --> 06:29.662
No, don't worry about that right now.

06:29.664 --> 06:31.797
Did you find her? The rev's girl?

06:31.799 --> 06:33.632
Yeah. Yeah, we found her.

06:33.634 --> 06:35.634
Where was she?

06:37.672 --> 06:40.506
Hey, I'm not interrogating you right now.

06:40.508 --> 06:43.442
I just want to know everyone's okay.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.379
I'm not okay.

06:46.381 --> 06:50.016
Did somebody hurt you?

06:50.018 --> 06:53.719
I've just been to hell and back.

06:53.721 --> 06:55.521
Listen, there's nothing
you can do about this.

06:55.523 --> 06:57.323
You don't know that, all right?

06:57.325 --> 06:59.625
I care about you, a lot,

06:59.627 --> 07:00.860
and there's nothing in this world

07:00.862 --> 07:03.062
I wouldn't do for you.

07:03.064 --> 07:05.498
Just tell me.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.533
If I told you what it is,

07:07.535 --> 07:11.003
there's a chance you'd
stop feeling that way.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.872
Trust me.

07:12.874 --> 07:14.573
Trusting people hasn't
been working out too well

07:14.575 --> 07:17.009
for me lately, Dusty.

07:17.011 --> 07:18.878
I...

07:18.880 --> 07:21.580
If you see my brother come
home, will you let me know?

07:28.222 --> 07:31.724
God, David, please just be okay.

07:39.667 --> 07:43.169
A&O is more than just a company.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.205
It's about real American values,

07:46.207 --> 07:48.074
changing the way we live our lives

07:48.076 --> 07:52.578
one person at a time, and
now for the first time ever,

07:52.580 --> 07:57.450
A&O is offering all of you
the chance to take life now

07:57.452 --> 07:59.885
at our brand-new success retreat.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.789
Take life now.

08:07.295 --> 08:10.463
His word was spreading,

08:10.465 --> 08:13.432
promising a life without obligation

08:13.434 --> 08:17.436
or complication or consequence,

08:17.438 --> 08:20.439
because the things that make us human...

08:22.543 --> 08:25.077
Make us weak.

08:25.079 --> 08:28.747
He was a prophet for our times,

08:28.749 --> 08:31.150
a new gospel for the ages.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.822
What was she like?

08:36.823 --> 08:39.291
She tried to be happy.

08:39.293 --> 08:44.630
I think more for me and
David than for herself.

08:44.632 --> 08:47.733
It wasn't easy in that house,

08:47.735 --> 08:51.937
even before Sangolo.

08:51.939 --> 08:54.006
I can't forgive your dad for not telling us

08:54.008 --> 08:56.308
the truth about Mom,

08:56.310 --> 08:58.010
but if he really did make her happy,

08:58.012 --> 09:00.112
even for a little while,

09:00.114 --> 09:02.281
then without him, we wouldn't have you.

09:05.353 --> 09:07.786
How come you don't have the mark?

09:07.788 --> 09:11.123
We're both born from an angel.

09:11.125 --> 09:14.126
I don't know.

09:14.128 --> 09:19.932
Mom said something down
there about Trinity.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.935
Like the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost?

09:22.937 --> 09:24.937
Blood of my blood.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.975
That's why I felt so much stronger

09:29.977 --> 09:32.044
when we were together.

09:32.046 --> 09:36.015
We're both parts of the same whole.

09:36.017 --> 09:38.851
Then there's still a part missing.

09:38.853 --> 09:40.886
What happened to your collar?

09:40.888 --> 09:42.988
Not until I've earned the
right to wear it again.

09:42.990 --> 09:44.623
I let revenge take over.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.125
Told myself I was fighting God's war

09:46.127 --> 09:47.960
when it was really my own.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.462
Should have told you truth, no matter what.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.331
This is everyone's war now.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.833
Enos has an entire army
waiting to be unleashed.

09:54.835 --> 09:56.702
If we don't find a way to destroy him,

09:56.704 --> 09:59.205
then nothing will stop him
from taking over Charleston,

09:59.207 --> 10:02.408
one soul at a time.

10:02.410 --> 10:05.244
Enos has been going after all three of you.

10:05.246 --> 10:07.680
Ever since that mark first
appeared on your back,

10:07.682 --> 10:11.684
he's kept the three of you apart.

10:11.686 --> 10:14.353
He's scared.

10:14.355 --> 10:17.556
Angel, demon...

10:19.227 --> 10:21.694
So what's David?

10:21.696 --> 10:23.529
He's like me.

10:23.531 --> 10:25.531
He's human.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.243
So this is it, then?

10:37.245 --> 10:39.378
What you've always wanted.

10:39.380 --> 10:40.713
What do you mean?

10:40.715 --> 10:44.049
His power is what bound me to you.

10:44.051 --> 10:45.584
Once he's destroyed...

10:45.586 --> 10:47.386
I'll finally be free.

10:47.388 --> 10:49.054
And I'll go back to hell.

10:49.056 --> 10:50.889
You know what will happen to me down there.

10:50.891 --> 10:53.292
Don't put that burden on me.

10:53.294 --> 10:54.893
After everything you've done to me.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.396
What about everything I've done for you?

10:57.398 --> 10:59.698
All the times I saved your life,

10:59.700 --> 11:01.767
Grace's life, David's life.

11:01.769 --> 11:03.135
What about my life?

11:03.137 --> 11:04.370
You've known since the beginning

11:04.372 --> 11:06.071
I wanted you out.

11:06.073 --> 11:07.740
You just never believed
I'd be strong enough

11:07.742 --> 11:09.742
to finally do it.

11:11.946 --> 11:14.280
Maybe you are stronger than I thought,

11:14.282 --> 11:16.248
but it's still not enough.

11:18.986 --> 11:21.587
You can't beat Enos without me,

11:21.589 --> 11:24.623
so why should I help you if
it means digging my own grave?

11:24.625 --> 11:27.893
I can't keep living with
a demon inside of me.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.963
Then I'll let Enos kill
us both if I have to.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.667
Promise me, Maria...

11:34.669 --> 11:37.569
Promise me you won't let
me die if I do this for you.

11:43.844 --> 11:46.812
Dusty.

11:46.814 --> 11:48.814
I'll be right there.

12:20.481 --> 12:22.047
David.

12:22.049 --> 12:24.483
Hi, Mar.

12:24.485 --> 12:25.718
Are you okay?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.820
Yeah. I'm fine.

12:27.822 --> 12:29.154
You sure?

12:29.156 --> 12:30.456
Yeah.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.292
Like I said.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.828
Stop! What are you doing?

12:35.830 --> 12:38.664
I put my own life on hold for too long.

12:38.666 --> 12:42.301
I think it's time I move on. You know?

12:42.303 --> 12:44.670
I'm tired of fighting.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.472
Excuse me?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.474
What's gotten into you?

12:48.476 --> 12:49.842
David, I need you right now...

12:49.844 --> 12:51.910
"I need, I need, I need."

12:51.912 --> 12:54.046
You should hear yourself sometime.

12:54.048 --> 12:56.315
Well, guess what, Mar.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.384
Your problems aren't my problems.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.820
What I need is to start taking life now.

13:05.526 --> 13:06.992
Are you high?

13:06.994 --> 13:08.927
First time in my life I
feel good about myself,

13:08.929 --> 13:10.562
the first thing out of your mouth

13:10.564 --> 13:11.830
is that I'm a junkie.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.366
Another reason I'm leaving. Thanks.

13:14.368 --> 13:15.868
I didn't mean it like that.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.003
You just don't understand, Maria.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.072
Everything isn't always about you.

13:20.074 --> 13:22.741
We can't all just be
daddy's little princess.

13:22.743 --> 13:24.176
What the hell are you talking about?

13:24.178 --> 13:25.711
You and that demon bitch.

13:25.713 --> 13:27.279
Watch it, David.

13:27.281 --> 13:28.580
Oh, yeah?

13:28.582 --> 13:30.916
What are you gonna do?

13:32.553 --> 13:34.620
See, you can't even take
care of things yourself.

13:34.622 --> 13:36.422
You need some thousand-year-old bitch.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.557
Well, you'd be nothing without me!

13:39.894 --> 13:41.126
No.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.729
Maria, you okay?

13:43.731 --> 13:45.964
Get out!

13:57.853 --> 14:00.687
You're a hard woman to get alone, Abigail.

14:00.689 --> 14:02.322
Save your breath, whoever you are in there.

14:02.324 --> 14:04.391
It's okay.

14:04.393 --> 14:06.860
I don't need Maria killing
herself if David gets hurt,

14:06.862 --> 14:09.997
so I'll be nice and
gentle when I rip you out.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.032
You're playing for the wrong team.

14:12.034 --> 14:14.334
Enos wants to make a deal.

14:14.336 --> 14:15.769
I don't make deals.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.872
It's okay. Maria can't hear us now.

14:18.874 --> 14:21.074
It's just you and me.

14:24.046 --> 14:26.179
There's nothing Enos has that I want.

14:26.181 --> 14:28.615
But he wants you.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.187
Let's have a drink.

14:39.128 --> 14:44.264
You really think Maria
is the one Enos is after?

14:44.266 --> 14:49.603
She's just another
mortal, but you, Abigail,

14:49.605 --> 14:51.705
you were supposed to be his queen.

14:51.707 --> 14:54.641
That ship sailed a long time ago.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.043
I'm a traitor.

14:56.045 --> 14:58.245
If I go back now, it's a death sentence.

14:58.247 --> 15:00.213
What if Enos can make all that go away,

15:00.215 --> 15:02.049
grant you a full pardon,

15:02.051 --> 15:04.117
wipe the record clean?

15:04.119 --> 15:05.552
He can do that?

15:05.554 --> 15:07.654
Enos is second in command, beautiful...

15:07.656 --> 15:09.623
Above and below.

15:09.625 --> 15:13.960
He's got the position and
clout to do anything he wants.

15:13.962 --> 15:15.929
But Maria...

15:15.931 --> 15:17.731
Has been trying to get rid
of you since the beginning.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.733
You owe her nothing.

15:23.772 --> 15:26.907
Even if you stay inside Maria
until she's a hundred years old,

15:26.909 --> 15:28.642
that's just a blink of an eye for you.

15:28.644 --> 15:32.412
One day, she'll die,
and then you'll die too.

15:34.416 --> 15:38.785
Unless you do the smart thing.

15:41.924 --> 15:43.824
What does he want me to do?

15:51.533 --> 15:55.435
I'd always hoped Maria would
be strong enough on her own.

15:55.437 --> 15:57.871
Truth is...

16:00.042 --> 16:02.442
You've always been part of this fight.

16:14.890 --> 16:19.059
Every father hopes his daughter is special

16:19.061 --> 16:21.828
and will do great things.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.732
Should be counting my blessings.

16:33.342 --> 16:37.010
And I'll do anything I can to help you.

16:41.183 --> 16:46.153
They say that siblings are
the friends God gave you,

16:46.155 --> 16:51.758
the only ones who can truly
see the person you are inside.

16:57.232 --> 16:59.232
Abigail.

17:03.438 --> 17:06.006
David.

17:07.376 --> 17:09.009
Wake up.

17:09.011 --> 17:11.611
Mm.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.047
What happened? Abigail.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.615
I don't remember.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.849
She took over when you changed.

17:16.852 --> 17:18.385
Oh, my God. Did I hurt you?

17:18.387 --> 17:20.854
I don't think so, but
tell me what you remember.

17:20.856 --> 17:22.521
We were screaming.

17:22.523 --> 17:23.589
Dusty came in.

17:23.592 --> 17:25.959
Dusty.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.560
He saw Abigail.

17:27.563 --> 17:29.529
Maria, she killed my demon.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.464
You sure?

17:31.466 --> 17:34.067
She saved my life.

17:34.069 --> 17:37.771
It's okay. You're safe now.

17:37.773 --> 17:39.239
Just rest.

17:41.577 --> 17:43.610
Dusty.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.882
Dusty, wait!

17:57.593 --> 18:00.293
Not unless you can explain
what I saw back there.

18:00.295 --> 18:01.828
You know, no more bullshit, all right?

18:01.830 --> 18:04.064
I deserve more than that from you.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.633
Either you tell me what
the hell is going on...

18:06.635 --> 18:09.603
The truth... or I'm done.

18:11.506 --> 18:12.973
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

18:12.975 --> 18:16.176
Right now, I think I'm probably crazy.

18:22.784 --> 18:25.986
Remember this morning

18:25.988 --> 18:28.955
I said I'd been to hell and back?

18:28.957 --> 18:31.024
What are you telling me?

18:34.029 --> 18:38.431
What you saw back there was a demon.

18:38.433 --> 18:40.267
My demon.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.974
I know.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.542
It's insane.

18:54.850 --> 18:56.883
I've seen things too...

18:56.885 --> 19:00.687
when I was fighting overseas...
a kind of darkness in people

19:00.689 --> 19:04.324
I didn't think I could ever
explain to another human being.

19:04.326 --> 19:08.295
The kind of darkness that
takes you over, controls you.

19:11.166 --> 19:14.034
That thing... that demon.

19:14.036 --> 19:16.303
Abigail.

19:16.305 --> 19:18.538
It's her name.

19:19.841 --> 19:22.242
You can control her?

19:22.244 --> 19:24.678
Sometimes.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.880
I'm trying.

19:29.351 --> 19:32.152
I've never met anyone
like you before, Maria.

19:35.557 --> 19:38.692
So you're not leaving then?

19:38.694 --> 19:39.693
No.

19:48.403 --> 19:49.869
What's wrong?

19:54.343 --> 19:58.878
I've only felt this way
with one other man before.

20:14.429 --> 20:17.397
Listen, Dusty.

20:17.399 --> 20:20.600
There's a lot more trouble still coming.

20:20.602 --> 20:23.269
There's something I have to do.

20:23.271 --> 20:25.071
Then let me help you.

20:25.073 --> 20:28.241
I'm serious.

20:28.243 --> 20:31.244
This isn't me pushing you away.

20:31.246 --> 20:35.315
Just give me a little more
time to see this thing through.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.883
Whatever you need.

20:54.102 --> 20:55.502
After everything that happened,

20:55.504 --> 20:58.571
I was just in so much pain.

20:58.573 --> 21:00.507
I didn't see Dad coming
until it was too late.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.808
I'm sorry.

21:01.810 --> 21:03.176
It's okay, David.

21:03.178 --> 21:06.146
He went after you because he's desperate.

21:06.148 --> 21:10.917
He knows he can't beat
us if we're all together.

21:10.919 --> 21:13.520
What else do you remember?

21:13.522 --> 21:16.322
Some big retreat coming up.

21:16.324 --> 21:18.958
Everybody at A&O was talking about it.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.193
That demon that he put inside me,

21:20.195 --> 21:22.962
it wanted me to bring you there... to Enos.

21:22.964 --> 21:25.498
With David still possessed,
there'd be no Trinity.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.100
You all would have walked
straight into his hands.

21:27.102 --> 21:28.768
So let's give him what he wants.

21:28.770 --> 21:30.837
- What are you talking about?
- No, he's right.

21:30.839 --> 21:33.006
If Enos still thinks
you're under his control...

21:33.008 --> 21:35.508
Then I can lead us right to him.

21:35.510 --> 21:37.811
Mom said that, with the
three of us together,

21:37.813 --> 21:39.512
we could destroy him, right?

21:39.514 --> 21:41.548
We don't even know how this
Trinity is supposed to work.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.116
We're all here now.

21:43.118 --> 21:44.551
I don't feel any different.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.019
It has to work.

21:46.021 --> 21:48.354
We can finally end this for good.

21:48.356 --> 21:50.857
We just have to have a little faith.

21:50.859 --> 21:53.993
Isn't that what you always say, Bledsoe?

21:53.995 --> 21:55.829
Where is this retreat supposed to happen?

21:55.831 --> 21:58.832
Where do you think?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.470
Sangolo.

22:08.867 --> 22:12.070
If there is such a thing as hell on Earth,

22:12.072 --> 22:14.706
then it's a place I've already been.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.742
We all have.

22:17.744 --> 22:20.244
Sangolo.

22:20.246 --> 22:23.514
I used to swear I'd never go back

22:23.516 --> 22:25.650
until Father showed me the light.

22:33.593 --> 22:35.727
Look at all these lost souls.

22:35.729 --> 22:39.530
They have no idea they're on
their way to see the Devil.

22:39.532 --> 22:42.767
We have to play along for now.

22:42.769 --> 22:44.502
We don't have a choice.

22:44.504 --> 22:46.337
Sangolo is where it all started,

22:46.339 --> 22:48.339
and that's where it's going to end.

22:52.278 --> 22:56.681
Why would A&O build anything
there after what happened?

22:56.683 --> 22:58.883
I would have thought the
whole island was condemned.

22:58.885 --> 23:01.886
Because this is Enos'
new Order of Everlasting.

23:03.957 --> 23:07.558
A crowd of new hosts
for his army of demons.

23:11.865 --> 23:14.198
- Watch your step, please.
- Right this way.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.778
Grace, you okay?

23:28.448 --> 23:30.448
- What we did...
- Almost did.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.750
You're still innocent, remember?

23:32.752 --> 23:35.153
That's not the point. It was wrong.

23:37.490 --> 23:40.425
We didn't know.

23:40.427 --> 23:42.427
No matter what...

23:45.065 --> 23:47.298
I still love you.

23:49.903 --> 23:51.969
It's just a different kind of love now.

23:54.007 --> 23:57.942
I know.

23:57.944 --> 24:00.311
Don't worry.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.980
It'll all be okay once
we get to Sangolo Island.

24:10.190 --> 24:12.190
Maria!

24:14.294 --> 24:16.260
- What are you doing here?
- I'm coming with you.

24:16.262 --> 24:18.663
Look, I meant what I said before.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.131
I know you can take care of yourself,

24:20.133 --> 24:21.999
but if you got trouble coming,

24:22.001 --> 24:24.001
I want to be there when it happens.

24:42.122 --> 24:45.857
Maria senses something.

24:45.859 --> 24:49.994
I can see the way she
looks at me... uncertain.

24:52.198 --> 24:55.833
But it doesn't matter now.

24:55.835 --> 24:58.703
Once we're on Sangolo,

24:58.705 --> 25:01.706
nothing else will matter ever again.

25:05.812 --> 25:08.346
Watch your step on the way down, folks.

25:37.377 --> 25:39.177
Greetings, all.

25:39.179 --> 25:43.548
Welcome to the first day
of your brand-new lives.

25:43.550 --> 25:45.183
Now, you lucky folks are the first

25:45.185 --> 25:47.285
to visit our brand-new campus.

25:47.287 --> 25:48.886
This is sick.

25:48.888 --> 25:51.255
I know, but it'll be over soon.

25:51.257 --> 25:53.925
Leading each of you through
several orientation exercises

25:53.927 --> 25:55.960
in preparation for tonight's seminar.

25:55.962 --> 26:01.132
Now, remember... true success
begins with self-reliance.

26:01.134 --> 26:02.967
Come on in.

26:07.540 --> 26:10.107
Now, as you enter the retreat,

26:10.109 --> 26:12.810
you may become separated from
the parties you've arrived with.

26:12.812 --> 26:14.712
Show us that confidence.

26:14.714 --> 26:17.548
Break away from your
friends and your family.

26:17.550 --> 26:21.586
Blaze your own new trail.

26:21.588 --> 26:23.321
Come on in.

26:23.323 --> 26:25.256
Right this way, princess.

26:26.726 --> 26:28.459
Maria, what just happened?

26:28.461 --> 26:30.094
He knows we're here.

26:30.096 --> 26:33.097
Who knows we're here? What's wrong?

26:33.099 --> 26:35.066
Where are the others? Where's David?

26:35.068 --> 26:37.001
I don't know. They... they were right here.

26:37.003 --> 26:38.970
Okay, this group right with me.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.572
Come on, stay with me. This
island plays tricks on you.

26:57.090 --> 27:00.191
Hello? Where'd everyone go?

27:00.193 --> 27:03.628
Maria? David? Dad?

27:04.631 --> 27:06.931
Gracie.

27:06.933 --> 27:08.165
David, is that you?

27:08.167 --> 27:09.800
You were right, Grace.

27:09.802 --> 27:13.337
What we did was very, very bad.

27:13.339 --> 27:15.139
But don't worry.

27:15.141 --> 27:18.142
Soon all of that pain will be gone.

27:18.144 --> 27:21.545
He'll make all the bad feelings go away.

27:25.952 --> 27:28.286
Gracie!

27:28.288 --> 27:29.353
Gracie!

27:30.356 --> 27:31.656
Gracie!

27:34.294 --> 27:36.661
Open this door!

27:36.663 --> 27:39.730
The next step to success

27:39.732 --> 27:43.701
is letting go of that
which you cannot control.

27:48.641 --> 27:50.041
What's so important on the other side?

27:54.247 --> 27:56.147
My daughter.

27:56.149 --> 27:58.082
"My"?

27:58.084 --> 28:01.385
See, that's an interesting word, "my."

28:01.387 --> 28:03.888
It implies ownership.

28:03.890 --> 28:07.925
This man believes that a
grown woman is his possession,

28:07.927 --> 28:10.328
that he owns her.

28:10.330 --> 28:14.098
No one here belongs to
anyone else, my friend.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.400
Who do you think you are?

28:16.402 --> 28:17.802
I'm not gonna ask you again.

28:17.804 --> 28:20.037
Yeah, good job. Get angry.

28:20.039 --> 28:21.906
Show some passion.

28:25.778 --> 28:28.713
Take life now!

28:28.715 --> 28:32.750
Take life now! Take life now!

28:32.752 --> 28:34.952
I guess you were right, Reverend.

28:34.954 --> 28:37.054
- You can own another person.
- Take life now!

28:37.056 --> 28:39.457
And now, you belong to him.

28:49.663 --> 28:52.698
We have to find David and Grace.

28:52.700 --> 28:56.569
Looks like everyone just disappeared.

29:00.408 --> 29:03.075
Do you like what I've done with the place?

29:03.077 --> 29:06.646
Sure is nice to have you
in your old room again.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.083
What is this place?

29:15.690 --> 29:17.456
It's evil.

29:17.458 --> 29:19.458
No matter how he tries to dress it up.

29:21.529 --> 29:22.761
Who?

29:27.201 --> 29:30.603
My father, Enos.

29:35.543 --> 29:38.277
He's the one who put that demon inside you?

29:40.047 --> 29:41.213
Listen to me.

29:41.215 --> 29:43.215
He can't hurt you now.

29:43.217 --> 29:44.817
You got my word, Maria.

29:44.819 --> 29:46.752
You can't promise that.

29:49.757 --> 29:52.157
What's that sound?

29:52.159 --> 29:54.426
I don't know.

29:54.428 --> 29:56.262
Come on.

30:03.104 --> 30:06.572
Our family is home again,

30:06.574 --> 30:08.841
and home is a place

30:08.843 --> 30:11.844
where nothing bad can ever happen.

30:15.016 --> 30:17.016
Let me out of here!

30:20.121 --> 30:21.954
♪ I don't want to choose ♪

30:23.190 --> 30:26.659
♪ I want you all for myself ♪

30:26.661 --> 30:29.461
♪ But this world don't make sense ♪

30:29.463 --> 30:31.430
♪ It's never easy ♪

30:36.170 --> 30:39.838
That's the first song Mom
ever taught me how to play.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.107
You know that feeling when it's like

30:42.109 --> 30:44.944
you're channeling something
from some higher plane,

30:44.946 --> 30:47.880
like you're just a vessel
for something much bigger?

30:47.882 --> 30:51.216
That's what's happening,
and it feels good, Gracie.

30:51.218 --> 30:52.851
Everything feels so good.

30:52.853 --> 30:54.787
It's not real, David,

30:54.789 --> 30:57.690
and I know there's still a
part of you that can hear me.

30:57.692 --> 30:58.991
Help me, David.

30:58.993 --> 31:00.793
Don't let him hurt us again.

31:00.795 --> 31:04.496
I would never let anyone hurt you.

31:08.202 --> 31:11.537
Don't you remember those
early days at Everlasting?

31:11.539 --> 31:13.739
How easy everything was?

31:13.741 --> 31:15.975
It's only once we got
out into the real world

31:15.977 --> 31:18.711
that everything got so
difficult, so confusing.

31:18.713 --> 31:20.212
We were just kids.

31:20.214 --> 31:22.414
We were free.

31:22.416 --> 31:23.716
Snap out of it.

31:23.718 --> 31:25.751
You shouldn't have done that.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.486
I wasn't free.

31:27.488 --> 31:29.254
I was his.

31:33.427 --> 31:35.527
I'm just trying to help you, Grace.

31:35.529 --> 31:37.563
Why can't you see that?

31:57.218 --> 31:59.551
- Hey.
- What?

31:59.553 --> 32:01.587
Do you hear that?

32:03.691 --> 32:05.557
Yeah.

32:05.559 --> 32:11.530
Take life now! Take
life now! Take life now!

32:11.532 --> 32:16.068
Take life now! Take life now!

32:16.070 --> 32:18.737
Take life now! Take life now!

32:18.739 --> 32:20.539
I think it's coming from in there.

32:20.541 --> 32:25.811
Take life now! Take
life now! Take life now!

32:27.114 --> 32:29.782
- Don't touch her!
- No! Dusty!

32:29.784 --> 32:31.884
- Take life now!
- Get off of me! Maria!

32:31.886 --> 32:34.253
- Let go of me!
- Take life now!

32:34.255 --> 32:38.123
- Take life now! Take life now!
- No! David! David!

32:38.125 --> 32:40.392
Take life now! Take
life now! Take life now!

32:40.394 --> 32:43.996
- Abigail, I'm gonna need you!
- Take life now!

32:43.998 --> 32:46.799
Take life now!

32:56.143 --> 32:58.243
Abigail!

33:05.953 --> 33:07.786
Abigail!

33:07.788 --> 33:09.755
She has her mother's voice, doesn't she?

33:11.525 --> 33:12.858
- Enos.
- Here we are, Elijah.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.126
Just you and me.

33:16.130 --> 33:18.197
Can I pour you one?

33:18.199 --> 33:22.367
- No... no, you're a mean drunk.
- Abigail! Abigail.

33:22.369 --> 33:24.937
Now, in recovery, you remember the step

33:24.939 --> 33:27.806
about giving yourself up to a higher power?

33:27.808 --> 33:29.641
Don't you think it's obvious
the higher power's already

33:29.643 --> 33:32.711
given up on you?

33:32.713 --> 33:34.713
Mmm.

33:36.484 --> 33:38.550
Now, I have to get back to my little party,

33:38.552 --> 33:43.789
but first I'm gonna watch you
beg while I take away everything

33:43.791 --> 33:47.126
you love like you did to me.

33:47.128 --> 33:49.228
No!

33:49.230 --> 33:50.729
Gracie.

33:53.134 --> 33:55.634
You stole my wife.

33:55.636 --> 33:58.804
You seduced her into leaving her children.

33:58.806 --> 34:01.740
You broke my family apart.

34:01.742 --> 34:05.010
So who's the devil?

34:05.012 --> 34:09.181
You make me sick, you pious hypocrite.

34:16.090 --> 34:18.257
But I do thank you for Grace.

34:18.259 --> 34:20.359
I'm gonna have a hell of a lot of fun

34:20.360 --> 34:22.761
gutting that little angel of yours.

34:22.763 --> 34:25.197
Leave my daughter alone!

34:25.199 --> 34:26.331
Aren't you gonna beg?

34:26.333 --> 34:27.833
No!

34:27.835 --> 34:30.435
Well, if you're not gonna beg...

34:32.005 --> 34:33.871
Ahh!

34:33.873 --> 34:35.706
Die!

34:48.956 --> 34:50.155
Aah!

35:31.122 --> 35:33.822
Abigail, please.

35:33.824 --> 35:35.624
Where are you?

35:35.626 --> 35:39.995
Shh, it's okay, Maria. I'm right here.

35:39.997 --> 35:41.630
No! No!

35:52.143 --> 35:54.843
I'm sorry it had to be this way,

35:54.845 --> 35:56.679
but like you always said,

35:56.681 --> 35:58.447
this relationship wasn't
good for either of us.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.082
What have you done?

36:00.084 --> 36:01.951
The same thing you would have done to me

36:01.953 --> 36:04.019
if you had the chance.

36:04.021 --> 36:05.521
We're finally going to
be rid of each other,

36:05.523 --> 36:07.223
just not the way you hoped.

36:07.225 --> 36:10.859
Whatever Enos told you, it's a lie.

36:10.861 --> 36:12.728
You have to help me stop this!

36:12.730 --> 36:14.663
Oh, Maria.

36:14.665 --> 36:17.967
Don't make this any harder
on yourself than it has to be.

36:17.969 --> 36:21.370
You still think you're the strong one.

36:21.372 --> 36:23.138
Before this is over, Abigail,

36:23.140 --> 36:26.141
I swear I'll make you
pay for what you've done.

36:31.182 --> 36:32.881
What's the matter, son?

36:32.883 --> 36:35.084
Do I have to watch this part?

36:35.086 --> 36:38.754
You want your sister to
be happy again, don't you?

36:38.756 --> 36:40.756
She doesn't look happy.

36:40.758 --> 36:43.559
Neither did Grace.

36:43.561 --> 36:46.328
That's because it's not over yet.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.497
No. This isn't who I want to be.

36:51.736 --> 36:54.937
Take it back.

36:54.939 --> 36:57.773
I don't want it.

36:57.775 --> 36:59.108
Take it back!

36:59.110 --> 37:00.442
Sorry, David.

37:02.546 --> 37:04.713
There are some things we
can never come back from.

37:31.442 --> 37:34.276
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:34.278 --> 37:35.944
No. Not like this.

37:35.946 --> 37:37.479
Not while he still has my daughter.

37:37.481 --> 37:38.914
Hey, keep your hands off me

37:38.916 --> 37:40.416
and stand behind the yellow line.

37:40.418 --> 37:42.484
Turn this damn bus around.

37:42.486 --> 37:44.887
This bus is going straight to Purgatory.

37:44.889 --> 37:47.089
Listen, you can drive me all
the way to hell if you want

37:47.091 --> 37:49.591
but not until I know my daughter's safe.

37:49.593 --> 37:51.093
Hell isn't on his route.

37:52.963 --> 37:54.630
But I know some other
ways of getting there,

37:54.632 --> 37:57.633
if you're interested.

37:57.635 --> 37:58.801
Who are you?

37:58.803 --> 38:00.636
I'll give you a clue.

38:00.638 --> 38:03.439
I used to be an old friend of your boss.

38:06.110 --> 38:09.311
You know, I don't know how you
can stand working for that guy.

38:09.313 --> 38:12.681
God's too busy doing God knows what

38:12.683 --> 38:16.118
and only has time to talk to the Pope?

38:16.120 --> 38:20.189
Me, I'm always listening.

38:20.191 --> 38:23.192
Can you save my daughter?

38:23.194 --> 38:26.195
Why should I?

38:26.197 --> 38:27.996
I'll give you my soul.

38:27.998 --> 38:29.965
Huh?

38:29.967 --> 38:34.703
A priest's eternal soul for a girl's life.

38:34.705 --> 38:37.005
Pass.

38:37.007 --> 38:40.609
Look, I can always use
another priest on my team,

38:40.611 --> 38:44.313
but Enos is one of my top earners.

38:44.315 --> 38:46.315
I'm gonna need a little more.

38:46.317 --> 38:48.117
That's all I have left to give.

38:48.119 --> 38:50.119
Sorry, Father. No deal.

38:50.121 --> 38:51.487
Then why are you here?

38:51.489 --> 38:54.823
Mm.

38:56.560 --> 39:02.364
You know, I like riding on
the bus every once in a while.

39:02.366 --> 39:05.801
Something 'bout the smell
of diesel, it just...

39:05.803 --> 39:08.303
It relaxes me.

39:12.343 --> 39:16.078
I always heard the Devil
was the betting type.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.713
Used to be a gambler like you.

39:17.715 --> 39:18.814
I'm listening.

39:18.816 --> 39:20.716
Give me one day.

39:20.718 --> 39:22.985
Just one more day of life
to try to save my daughter.

39:22.987 --> 39:25.921
Whether I win or lose, you
still keep my soul either way.

39:25.923 --> 39:29.191
Pass. A lot can happen in 24 hours.

39:29.193 --> 39:31.059
Come on, you know how this works.

39:31.061 --> 39:35.431
The house only takes a bet when
it knows for sure it'll win.

39:35.433 --> 39:38.233
So there's no chance.

39:38.235 --> 39:39.835
12 hours.

39:39.837 --> 39:41.904
Without Abigail, we both know
odds are a thousand to one

39:41.906 --> 39:44.706
I'll even make it to her.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.208
- Pass.
- Damn it!

39:50.915 --> 39:54.349
Well, Father, is that your final offer?

39:54.351 --> 39:56.385
30 minutes.

39:56.387 --> 39:57.719
Come again?

39:57.721 --> 39:59.721
30 minutes to try to save her

39:59.723 --> 40:03.091
and I'll serve you and Enos
in hell till the end of time.

40:12.603 --> 40:14.436
Maria.

40:22.746 --> 40:25.814
Dusty.

40:25.816 --> 40:27.916
I've seen things, Maria,

40:27.918 --> 40:29.618
a kind of darkness in people

40:29.620 --> 40:32.254
I didn't think I could ever explain.

40:32.256 --> 40:34.256
It would take over sometimes.

40:37.061 --> 40:41.463
Be honest... wasn't Dusty just
a little too good to be true?

40:41.465 --> 40:44.166
You believed it because
you wanted to feel loved.

40:44.168 --> 40:45.634
No.

40:49.273 --> 40:52.674
But I'll always love you, princess.

40:53.777 --> 40:55.611
Welcome home.

40:59.350 --> 41:01.416
Let's give 'em one hell of a show.

41:01.418 --> 41:02.851
Ahh!
