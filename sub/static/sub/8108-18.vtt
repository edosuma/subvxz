WEBVTT

00:21.648 --> 00:23.400
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

00:42.085 --> 00:44.003
You have a patient
waiting. See?

00:44.129 --> 00:45.213
I'm waiting for a follow-up.

00:45.338 --> 00:47.882
If you're talking
about Mr. Casdin,

00:48.007 --> 00:50.051
he has a deceased
sticker on his file,

00:50.176 --> 00:53.888
as do all the other follow-ups you have
scheduled for today.

00:56.808 --> 00:57.642
whoops!

01:05.859 --> 01:07.944
I had colds all winter.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.781
I've been in this room a while,
but it's spring now, right?

01:11.906 --> 01:15.493
I feel run down,
like maybe something big is coming on.

01:15.744 --> 01:18.955
Run down? Come on, give me
something. Sore throat?

01:19.164 --> 01:20.790
- No.
- Runny nose?

01:20.915 --> 01:22.709
No. I know it
sounds weird, I'm a nurse,

01:22.834 --> 01:26.588
but could you
run maybe a CBC or a thyroid...

01:30.300 --> 01:31.634
(GASPING)

01:36.639 --> 01:39.184
Dr. Cuddy,
need a consult!

01:42.604 --> 01:43.813
Until she
stops seizing,

01:43.938 --> 01:46.399
may as well go back
to my office and get my diagnosis on.

01:46.524 --> 01:47.942
CUDDY: She's
urinating on herself.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.111
She's having a seizure.
If she hadn't peed...

01:50.236 --> 01:51.780
It's green.

01:55.992 --> 01:57.494
Interesting.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.903
Thirty-five-year-old woman.

02:32.028 --> 02:34.364
Head of nursing
in an old-age home.

02:34.489 --> 02:37.659
Neurological
symptoms and "P"?

02:39.619 --> 02:42.997
(CHUCKLING) Oh, green pee.
I get it. Nice.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.500
THIRTEEN: Neuro is
also written in green.

02:45.625 --> 02:48.378
Does that mean she
has green neurological symptoms as well?

02:48.503 --> 02:51.422
From now on, I'm gonna use two colors.
Green indicates irony.

02:51.548 --> 02:52.757
Pseudomonas infection.

02:52.882 --> 02:54.384
She'd have
a fever. Toxins?

02:54.509 --> 02:56.719
Why are we
taking this case?

02:56.845 --> 03:00.849
Welcome, Your Lordship, we were just
preparing your morning briefing.

03:00.974 --> 03:02.725
Sorry I'm late,

03:02.851 --> 03:05.895
and, yes, green pee does meet
the only diagnostic requirement

03:06.020 --> 03:07.856
you care about.
It's interesting.

03:07.981 --> 03:10.400
But is it worth
us taking this case?

03:10.525 --> 03:14.320
"Us" aren't taking anything.
I'm taking. You're accepting.

03:14.863 --> 03:18.575
Okay, I accept. She has
adult-onset epilepsy,

03:18.700 --> 03:21.786
and she really likes
those St. Patrick's Day beers.

03:22.829 --> 03:25.290
Go check out the house and the office
for toxins and infections.

03:25.415 --> 03:27.750
Her neuro exam was normal,
no subsequent seizures.

03:27.876 --> 03:31.170
It's not life threatening.
It's not important.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.006
Luckily, neither are you.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.851
- You okay?
- Fine.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.769
You and House
this morning?

03:46.895 --> 03:48.062
The way you
were arguing?

03:48.187 --> 03:52.108
(SIGHING) Airing disagreements
doesn't qualify as arguing.

03:52.734 --> 03:56.821
Come on, man, I'm just trying
to help. We're friends.

03:57.864 --> 03:59.908
There are 400
Japanese teenagers

04:00.033 --> 04:01.159
you were playing
Halo with last night

04:01.284 --> 04:02.952
you're better
friends with.

04:03.077 --> 04:06.623
Your avatar should ask their avatars
how they're doing.

04:06.998 --> 04:08.750
I consider you
a good friend

04:08.875 --> 04:11.836
even if we don't
hang that much outside of work.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.756
I wasn't arguing with him.

04:14.881 --> 04:15.840
You kind of were.

04:15.965 --> 04:19.302
Fine, I was.
And you know what?

04:19.427 --> 04:20.553
I was right.

04:21.054 --> 04:23.431
You got conned.
Methylthioninium chloride.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.934
Notable side effect,
green urine.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.727
She's a nurse,
she knows the dosage,

04:27.852 --> 04:28.895
knows how to
fake a seizure.

04:29.020 --> 04:32.815
She pees pea soup and gets the warm
attention of doctors all week long.

04:32.941 --> 04:34.776
She's a Munchausen,
and you're her mark.

04:34.901 --> 04:35.860
So your insight
is based on

04:35.985 --> 04:39.238
discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug
at an old-age home.

04:39.364 --> 04:40.990
No good reason it'd be
sitting on her desk.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.785
You ever tried to pee on yourself
in public? It's not easy.

04:43.910 --> 04:46.621
Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat,
we peed in private.

04:46.746 --> 04:49.624
For good reason. I can spot
a fake seizure,

04:50.333 --> 04:53.169
which means this was real,
which means

04:53.294 --> 04:54.837
her problem is phenol.

04:54.963 --> 04:56.798
Carbolic acid?

04:56.923 --> 04:59.467
Yeah, maybe she
accidentally inhaled some

04:59.592 --> 05:02.387
at a gout treatment
facility, circa 1890.

05:02.512 --> 05:04.681
It's still in some
antiseptic throat sprays.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.933
She's been chugging
it all winter for her colds.

05:07.058 --> 05:08.977
Phenol explains the
seizure and the urine.

05:09.102 --> 05:10.603
She'd have to drink
five bottles a day.

05:10.728 --> 05:11.938
Which is why I'm sure
you won't have trouble

05:12.063 --> 05:15.984
discovering the evidence of it
when you search her house. Bye.

05:18.653 --> 05:22.949
And you can start her on charcoal
hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning.

05:24.075 --> 05:25.493
Seriously?

05:26.828 --> 05:28.830
Oh, you were lying
about the throat spray.

05:28.955 --> 05:31.332
That does make more sense.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.917
So why are you
wasting Taub's time?

05:33.042 --> 05:36.045
Because I don't want him to know
that I'm wasting my time

05:36.170 --> 05:38.840
disproving his fake
seizure theory. Zip!

05:41.092 --> 05:42.552
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

05:45.847 --> 05:47.015
NEIL: Chris?

05:48.266 --> 05:49.934
Chris Taub, right?

05:51.060 --> 05:52.270
Neil Zane.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.064
I was two years under you at
Collegiate High, remember?

05:55.189 --> 05:56.149
Sure.

05:56.274 --> 05:57.984
So you are some big
doctor here now?

05:58.860 --> 06:01.571
I'm a doctor. You?

06:02.113 --> 06:04.198
I was speaking at an econ course
over at the university.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.534
I tripped and banged my leg.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.204
I have some time.
Come with me.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.459
Hi. Tests back?

06:15.668 --> 06:17.420
Head CT was negative.

06:18.755 --> 06:21.591
What about a thyroid uptake
or abdominal ultrasound?

06:21.716 --> 06:26.387
Sure. How about I flash
some lights in front of your face first?

06:26.512 --> 06:27.889
You want me to have
another seizure?

06:28.014 --> 06:28.973
We're gonna have to
give up the room

06:29.098 --> 06:32.226
unless we can
confirm a problem.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.478
Okay-

06:40.359 --> 06:42.361
(CONVULSING)

06:54.874 --> 06:57.126
(SIGHING) Damn it!

06:57.251 --> 07:00.922
Oh, God.
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

07:01.047 --> 07:04.634
What are you worried about? You'll have
maybe a night in jail for fraud.

07:04.759 --> 07:06.761
I have to go tell one of
my employees he was right.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.806
I'm not a Munchausen.
I'm gonna die unless you help me.

07:09.931 --> 07:11.724
You'll have to come up
with something more original.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.310
A cat predicted my death.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.857
Cats make
terrible doctors.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.735
Oh, no, wait,
that's women. You're screwed.

07:26.531 --> 07:27.615
How'd you slip?

07:27.740 --> 07:31.119
I've had this
dizziness problem for a while now.

07:31.244 --> 07:32.829
You get checked
for labyrinthitis?

07:32.954 --> 07:36.040
On antibiotics for
a week. No difference.

07:36.332 --> 07:39.085
- Lie down a sec.
- Whoa, whoa, I'm dizzy.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.586
That's normal.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.089
So what are you teaching?

07:43.214 --> 07:44.632
Entrepreneurship.

07:44.757 --> 07:48.010
I'm a CEO. OstTech Industries.
We make medical devices.

07:48.136 --> 07:50.138
All right.
You can sit up.

07:50.930 --> 07:54.058
So, did that tell you
anything? Did I...

07:55.935 --> 07:57.353
Oh, my God.

07:59.105 --> 08:00.273
You just cured me.

08:00.398 --> 08:02.692
I figured you had a tiny calcium deposit
in your inner ear.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.610
I just shifted it around.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.196
I've seen three
doctors for this.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.741
- I'm buying you dinner.
- Forget it.

08:10.867 --> 08:14.036
Come on. I'm also an investor in a club,
we'll make it a night out.

08:14.162 --> 08:16.998
Well, I'm married, boring.

08:17.874 --> 08:20.668
I know some married people
who aren't boring.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.504
A few years back,
I was one of them.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.840
Good luck, Neil.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.141
If you're gonna kill me and rape me,
please do it in that order.

08:35.266 --> 08:38.019
This is the cat. Debbie.
Have you heard of her?

08:38.144 --> 08:40.605
Debbie? Sorry, but
without a last name...

08:40.730 --> 08:42.690
She was on the news.
We found her as a kitten.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.650
She lives in the nursing home.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.445
She only sleeps next to people
when they're about to die.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.113
Ten patients
in the last year.

08:49.238 --> 08:53.534
And then yesterday, she did it to me
while I was sitting on my couch.

08:53.659 --> 08:57.830
Please. The whole staff, the doctors
even, we all know this is real.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.540
Can you come back later?

08:59.665 --> 09:03.586
I have some business I'm conducting
with the Prince of Nigeria.

09:04.462 --> 09:07.840
Just watch this video.
It'll prove I'm not lying.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.386
Dr. House,
I am begging you.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.556
(GASPING FOR BREATH)

09:19.685 --> 09:20.728
Chest.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.568
Quick, before she goes without attention
for eight seconds.

09:27.693 --> 09:28.694
House.

09:33.324 --> 09:36.327
- She's faking. The cat told me.
- Listen.

09:37.787 --> 09:38.788
(GASPING)

09:39.956 --> 09:43.501
Soft breath sounds.
Means it's bronchospasm.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.714
You can't fake that.

09:53.469 --> 09:55.054
MAN ON TV: Debbie the cat
spends most of her time

09:55.179 --> 09:56.347
just prowling the halls,

09:56.555 --> 09:58.391
the queen of
her own private world.

09:58.516 --> 10:00.851
HOUSE: I gotta say, I don't think
the changes they've made

10:00.977 --> 10:02.561
to American Idol
really work for me.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.356
When Debbie climbs on a patientk bed
and goes to sleep,

10:05.481 --> 10:07.817
we call the loved ones
and tell them to come in.

10:07.942 --> 10:10.903
You wanna treat her?
She's a nut job.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.905
Don't we all
have quirks?

10:13.030 --> 10:15.783
Aren't those eccentricities
what make us human?

10:15.908 --> 10:18.744
<i>It's like Debbie's here on Earth
to bring people to the other side.</i>

10:18.869 --> 10:20.705
MAN: The doctors that we spoke to
also agree that the cat...

10:20.830 --> 10:22.873
Nut jobs get sick, too.

10:23.666 --> 10:28.421
So you think this
cat story is nonsense,

10:28.546 --> 10:31.465
and you admit she faked her
earlier symptoms,

10:31.590 --> 10:33.926
but you still think
she's actually sick now?

10:34.051 --> 10:37.388
Well, anything would sound ridiculous
if you said it in that voice.

10:37.513 --> 10:40.224
Confirm she's faking
or I'm gonna have to kick her out.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.767
There's that voice again.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.519
I'll give you 24 hours.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.272
Consecutive?

10:53.362 --> 10:54.947
What are you doing?

10:55.072 --> 11:00.328
No, Mr. Bond,
I expect you to die. Bronchospasm. Go.

11:00.453 --> 11:02.705
- Bronchitis.
- No cough, no fever,

11:02.830 --> 11:04.415
and Blofeld didn't
smoke a cigar.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.627
He might have. Dude had a lair,
means he was rich.

11:08.753 --> 11:13.299
Rich people enjoy a good stogie,
sometimes send them as gifts.

11:14.008 --> 11:15.634
Hey, Taub,
did that sound like

11:15.760 --> 11:18.679
I was awkwardly trying to segue
into making a point?

11:18.804 --> 11:20.639
- Yes.
- Emphysema.

11:20.765 --> 11:22.767
FOREMAN: Lungs
were clean on the CT.

11:22.892 --> 11:26.020
Dogs can be trained to predict
diabetic comas, epileptic seizures,

11:26.145 --> 11:29.190
they can smell cancer. It is possible
there's something to this cat.

11:29.315 --> 11:31.650
It's more possible
it was just a coincidence.

11:31.776 --> 11:34.612
Ten million nursing homes,
hundred million pet cats,

11:34.737 --> 11:36.072
one of them was bound
to pick a few winners.

11:36.197 --> 11:38.074
THIRTEEN: Debbie was able to predict
there was something wrong

11:38.199 --> 11:40.368
with the patient before you were.
Is that a coincidence, too?

11:40.493 --> 11:44.663
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything,
it might have caused the deaths.

11:44.789 --> 11:46.040
We should've
listened to Ted Nugent.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.585
Yeah. It could be cat scratch fever,
or visceral larva migrans.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.545
Maybe it didn't kill everyone
at the nursing home,

11:51.670 --> 11:53.255
but it may be killing Morgan.

11:53.381 --> 11:56.967
The worms hop from the cat to the
cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.

11:57.093 --> 11:58.844
Those cigars were for me.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.179
HOUSE: Hey, that reminds me.

12:00.304 --> 12:04.558
Why is some fancy CEO sending you
a box of Cuban cigars?

12:04.683 --> 12:06.685
Is it related to
your money worries?

12:06.811 --> 12:07.645
What money worries?

12:07.770 --> 12:10.815
Extrapolating from the fact that he's
been skipping his morning muffin,

12:10.940 --> 12:14.985
I'd say that he lost almost all
his money in the market last year.

12:15.611 --> 12:16.987
I'm on a diet.

12:17.613 --> 12:21.409
I'm also extrapolating from the online
portfolio you forgot to log off,

12:21.534 --> 12:23.661
but it's mostly
the muffins.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.705
Scope her for
worms in the lungs.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.380
We could help out in there.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.882
Yeah, it takes
at least four people

12:37.007 --> 12:40.469
to look inside a crazy woman's lungs
for imaginary worms.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.222
So, you're in
a good mood again.

12:43.347 --> 12:46.809
Do you need another speech
about what a great friend I am?

12:48.894 --> 12:51.439
I'm telling my wife
we don't need to downsize,

12:51.564 --> 12:53.315
but maybe we do.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.444
You really lost
all that money?

12:56.569 --> 12:58.696
I don't care about the money,
I just feel bad for Rachel.

12:59.155 --> 13:01.574
She married a guy in one situation,
ended up with another.

13:01.699 --> 13:03.534
- That's hard on anyone.
- Thanks,

13:03.659 --> 13:05.911
makes me feel much better,
hearing my wife's a gold digger.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.705
No, I just
meant she married

13:07.830 --> 13:10.374
this master-of-the-universe
successful surgeon,

13:10.499 --> 13:15.045
and now he's basically a flunky
for this mad scientist,

13:15.379 --> 13:17.923
who saves lives,
so that's good.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.386
There are no worms
in the lungs.

13:24.889 --> 13:26.891
What else could
cause bronchospasm?

13:27.016 --> 13:28.267
Severe acid reflux.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.685
No esophagitis,
it's not reflux.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.395
Why are you
pushing a crash cart?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.523
Because patients sometimes crash,
and they haven't yet invented

13:34.648 --> 13:38.277
a crash tractor for me to drive wildly
around the hallways.

13:40.404 --> 13:43.282
Why are we in the
coma patients' room?

13:44.408 --> 13:45.618
(MEOWS)

13:46.744 --> 13:49.830
You actually think the cat is going
to predict someone's death?

13:49.955 --> 13:53.626
No. I know the cat is not going
to predict anyone's death.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.753
And then I will have
scientifically disproved...

13:55.878 --> 13:57.588
You didn't keep this patient
despite the cat,

13:57.713 --> 13:59.507
you kept this patient
because of the cat.

13:59.632 --> 14:02.092
You're scared there's
something to it.

14:02.218 --> 14:05.471
If I could prove the non-existence
of an omniscient God

14:05.596 --> 14:07.890
who lovingly guides us
to the other side, I would.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.226
Cat version
will have to do.

14:12.436 --> 14:13.604
Are you scared?

14:13.729 --> 14:15.689
Cats' brains are
always in alpha mode.

14:15.814 --> 14:19.318
The few scientific tests that have
seemed to confirm psychic phenomena,

14:19.443 --> 14:20.653
that's where it takes place.

14:20.778 --> 14:23.280
Please tell me that you were kidding,
so I won't have to fire you.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.865
I was kidding.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.784
We still have
a human patient, right?

14:26.909 --> 14:29.286
- Airborne allergens possible?
- Skin test was negative.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.496
FOREMAN: Lungs
may be more sensitive.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.540
Or House
just screwed up.

14:32.665 --> 14:35.876
If you misinterpreted the breath sounds
as soft instead of loud,

14:36.001 --> 14:38.546
it's laryngospasm
instead of bronchospasm.

14:38.671 --> 14:40.589
Which she can
get from a simple panic attack,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.216
which she was having.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.970
I also heard the lung sounds, too, Taub.
You saying I screwed up?

14:46.095 --> 14:49.014
"Screwed up" is maybe
too harsh, but yes.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.268
THIRTEEN: Don't you
wanna check their charts?

14:52.393 --> 14:54.603
Of course not,
this is a double-blind.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.440
I don't want to even subconsciously
signal to Teddy which one's the sickest.

14:58.566 --> 15:00.150
Her name's Debbie.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.736
Are those welts
on that guy's arm?

15:02.861 --> 15:04.613
Were they here
when we got here?

15:09.368 --> 15:11.537
He has a severe
cat allergy.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.501
That never happened.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.794
Look at Debbie.

15:24.550 --> 15:29.638
Good news, Mr. Limpert.

15:30.014 --> 15:31.724
When you don't
die tonight,

15:31.849 --> 15:35.352
you will finally have done something
good for the world,

15:35.477 --> 15:38.522
as opposed to your
life as a fireman.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.318
Foreman's airborne allergen theory
makes the most sense.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.821
Do a methacholine
challenge on Catgirl to check it out.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.997
I told you to
get rid of Death Cat.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.542
- You see a cat?
- I see a litter box.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.587
This is a disability,
Dr. Cuddy.

16:01.712 --> 16:05.674
- I can't make it to the men's room...
- You pee on the mice, too?

16:06.133 --> 16:09.261
Well, now, you see, the mice actually
prove that I don't have a cat.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.763
Are these...

16:11.472 --> 16:15.059
Are these the genetically modified
lab mice from oncology?

16:15.267 --> 16:17.770
Genetically modified
for tastiness.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.692
Get rid of the cat,
and get rid of your patient.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.819
My team is doing
a methacholine challenge.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.113
Your team just completed
a methacholine challenge,

16:28.238 --> 16:30.282
which came up negative.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.576
Who told you about
the test? Taub?

16:32.701 --> 16:34.745
I'll never say. But yes.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.665
Her airway's clamped
down. I heard it.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.750
We kick her
onto the streets, it could happen again.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.419
Wish there was
a "lawsuit cat," it could warn you.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.630
I'm sorry, but if you
won't escort her out,

16:44.755 --> 16:47.341
I'll have to get
security to do it.

16:55.974 --> 16:59.103
You're joining me
for a goodbye smoke.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.938
I don't smoke.

17:01.188 --> 17:05.275
Fine, if you don't want the seventh
graders to think you're cool.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.491
I went through your purse.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.952
Horoscopes,
good-luck charms.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.788
You went to a good college,
good nursing school,

17:17.913 --> 17:20.290
so you weren't always
a superstitious idiot.

17:20.416 --> 17:21.709
I'm not a superstitious...

17:21.834 --> 17:24.670
How about four years,
that sound right?

17:25.212 --> 17:27.423
That's when you switched
from the family insurance plan

17:27.548 --> 17:28.799
to the one you're on now.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.301
I was married,
I got divorced.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.889
Two years before that,
you got chickenpox shots,

17:36.014 --> 17:39.184
which you only
get in adulthood when you have a kid.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.437
Or I should say
when you had a kid

17:41.562 --> 17:43.689
because no kid
has come to visit you.

17:43.814 --> 17:47.067
Which all makes me think
something bad happened.

17:50.738 --> 17:52.948
It was my stepson, Timothy.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.411
(COUGHS)

17:57.536 --> 17:59.037
What happened?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.039
He was in school.

18:01.165 --> 18:04.752
He was having
his morning snack, and he choked.

18:06.211 --> 18:10.215
And the teachers saw it, and they did
everything that they were supposed to.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.384
He shouldn't have died.

18:13.969 --> 18:16.221
You wanna
make it make sense.

18:18.974 --> 18:20.851
(CRYING) What's
wrong with that?

18:21.351 --> 18:24.313
It's meaningless
is what's wrong.

18:24.438 --> 18:28.066
What's wrong is that it doesn't
do a thing to bring your kid back,

18:28.192 --> 18:30.736
or put you and
your ex together again.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.948
(COUGHING)

18:35.866 --> 18:37.493
Rash on your neck.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.205
Probably not
enough for Cuddy.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.832
(COUGHING)

18:43.957 --> 18:46.543
- Can't breathe.
- Hey, Doc.

18:46.668 --> 18:47.961
(GASPING FOR BREATH)

18:49.254 --> 18:51.548
Breath sound soft
to you, Doc?

18:53.592 --> 18:56.011
Hooray, you're
officially sick.

19:02.226 --> 19:05.312
Churg-Strauss fits best.
Here's the plan.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.564
Taub, change the litter box.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.484
This is pathetic.

19:10.776 --> 19:13.946
You're still punishing me for calling
you out on the green urine lady?

19:14.071 --> 19:16.698
Nope, this is for
ratting me out to Cuddy.

19:16.824 --> 19:20.577
I'm not asking you to apologize,
just scoop some poop out of a box.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.329
Just clean it.

19:23.789 --> 19:24.790
Let House do it.

19:24.915 --> 19:25.749
FOREMAN: (SCOFFING)
Yeah, that'll happen.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.294
He won't just continue to let
our room smell like cat pee.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.421
I'll clean it next time.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.299
I'm out of here.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.643
Now that you've delivered
that important lesson,

19:44.768 --> 19:48.397
I'm gonna go
test the patient. Whoa!

19:50.274 --> 19:52.067
What, you think
your bag's going to die now?

19:52.192 --> 19:53.652
Now you're punishing me

19:53.777 --> 19:56.029
because you think I'm superstitious?
What do you care?

19:56.154 --> 19:57.990
It's not so much
about me caring, per so,

19:58.115 --> 20:01.326
it's more about me wondering
why you're such a credulous idiot.

20:01.451 --> 20:05.247
Thirteen, start the patient on steroids
for the Churg-Strauss.

20:05.539 --> 20:08.667
Unless we have something
we need to argue about?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.841
This is good stuff.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.175
The best.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.510
It's made from
the distilled sweat of

20:18.635 --> 20:21.513
recently-laid-off
hedge fund managers.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.973
Aren't you happy
you came out tonight?

20:23.098 --> 20:27.269
Yeah. I wasn't actually going to,
but not the greatest day at work.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.440
I used to have
an office like this.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.399
Used to?

20:32.524 --> 20:34.192
When I was
a plastic surgeon.

20:34.318 --> 20:37.029
But one day, I took
stock of my life and...

20:38.447 --> 20:41.033
(SIGHING)
Oh, screw it.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.537
I had an affair with the daughter
of one of my partners.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.749
They signed a non-disclosure,
I signed a non-compete.

20:48.874 --> 20:52.544
And the funny thing is
I wound up telling my wife anyway.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.050
You like your job?

20:58.175 --> 21:01.720
Same as you, same as everyone,
it has its ups and downs.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.391
You're lying
to make me feel better.

21:07.225 --> 21:12.940
Yeah. It's the best. I'm in charge,
you know. I'm a kid with toys.

21:13.065 --> 21:15.359
Speaking of which,
what do you think of the prototype?

21:15.484 --> 21:17.444
It's amazing.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.571
You gotta make it
a half-inch smaller, though.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.240
- You serious?
- I got small hands,

21:22.366 --> 21:23.909
6.5 gloves,
like women surgeons,

21:24.034 --> 21:25.535
which are your
fastest-g rowing market.

21:25.661 --> 21:29.414
Me and the girls would have to use
two hands to hit the switch.

21:30.749 --> 21:34.086
Why do I bother paying
the idiots that work for me?

21:34.211 --> 21:35.671
Put down that crap
you're drinking,

21:35.796 --> 21:39.758
because I am breaking out
the really good stuff.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.148
What's wrong?

21:55.273 --> 21:57.567
I went to the bathroom.
My urine...

21:57.693 --> 21:59.653
- Green again?
- It's brown.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.115
I didn't do anything. Honest.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.664
HOUSE: (SINGING) I'm just a girl
who can't say no

22:12.082 --> 22:14.126
It is possible
she's still faking.

22:14.251 --> 22:16.169
She didn't fake
the bronchospasm.

22:16.294 --> 22:19.214
You think she's faking some stuff,
but not other stuff?

22:19.339 --> 22:20.757
Maybe she's Unchausen?

22:20.882 --> 22:24.052
I'm just saying the brown urine
doesn't make sense.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.229
- What?
- Nothing.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.441
THIRTEEN: We've ruled out every
possible cause for brown urine.

22:37.566 --> 22:40.068
No blood in the urine,
liver and kidneys fine.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.154
Brown could be fecal. Fistula.

22:42.279 --> 22:43.321
We checked.

22:43.447 --> 22:45.449
How do we know
the urine is still brown?

22:45.574 --> 22:48.160
Had to be. Once
you've gone brown...

22:49.536 --> 22:52.873
If we've ruled out everything
that can make the urine brown,

22:52.998 --> 22:54.416
what if it just
looked brown.

22:54.541 --> 22:58.754
If the green dye never left her system,
what plus green makes brown?

23:00.297 --> 23:01.381
Purple.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.885
Strep bovis infection
from colon cancer.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.429
Paraneoplastic syndrome
would explain the bronchospasm.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.306
THIRTEEN: We scoped
her when we checked for the fistula,

23:09.431 --> 23:11.600
there's no tumor.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.268
Oh, no.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.188
I wasn't scared
by the umbrella, either.

23:16.313 --> 23:19.316
What? Not everything's
about you, Kutner.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.360
I realize it's stupid.
I just don't know everything,

23:22.486 --> 23:24.446
- I don't want to invite...
- Great.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.031
I thought your
superstitiousness

23:26.156 --> 23:27.324
had to do with your
folks being killed,

23:27.449 --> 23:30.077
but "you're stupid"
works just as well.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.289
Why is there
a ladder here?

23:34.790 --> 23:38.001
Whoops. Forgot that one.

23:38.126 --> 23:43.215
Scopes don't work as well as pillcams.
Give her one, find the tumor.

23:44.633 --> 23:47.219
Come with me, Tiny Taub.

24:04.569 --> 24:08.406
Sorry, I was late again. I've got
a long commute from the poorhouse.

24:08.532 --> 24:10.325
Knew it when I hired you.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.494
You'd eventually
miss the money,

24:12.619 --> 24:15.497
being the big shot
like your new CEO friend,

24:15.622 --> 24:18.333
if that nightclub
stamp on your hand is any indication.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.752
- Don't worry, I'm not quitting.
- I know.

24:20.877 --> 24:24.756
A guy who signs a non-compete instead of
just telling his wife that he cheated

24:24.881 --> 24:25.966
doesn't have
the guts to quit.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.801
Bad example.
I did tell her.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.303
From guilt,
not from courage.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.931
And bravely running
to Cuddy behind my back,

24:33.640 --> 24:36.434
and arriving heroically
late every day.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.770
Cowards make
lousy employees.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.231
Well, maybe you're a coward,
maybe you're quitting.

24:41.356 --> 24:43.316
Either way, I'm screwed.

24:52.325 --> 24:56.163
You'll note how Faster,
Pussycat! Kill! Kill!

24:56.288 --> 24:58.874
Has snuggled up
by coma guy over there.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.586
More importantly,
she did yesterday as well.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.005
And he's still breathing.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.673
We done?

25:20.979 --> 25:23.106
Thank you for
showing me this.

25:25.108 --> 25:28.403
But maybe she's just confused
in this new environment.

25:31.114 --> 25:34.075
In 1844, a preacher
in upstate New York

25:34.201 --> 25:38.205
added up some dates in the Bible
and predicted Jesus' return.

25:38.330 --> 25:41.041
His followers gave away
all their possessions

25:41.166 --> 25:42.751
and showed up in a field.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.836
Guess who didn't show.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.463
So the preacher said
that he miscalculated,

25:46.588 --> 25:48.048
and they went right
back the next month,

25:48.173 --> 25:49.674
but with more followers.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.052
Every time he was
irrefutably proved wrong,

to her she's not dying?

26:20.872 --> 26:23.625
That would be dumb,
as she might be dying.

26:23.750 --> 26:24.960
This woman lost her kid.

26:25.085 --> 26:27.504
Why are you attacking beliefs that give
her a little bit of comfort?

26:27.629 --> 26:29.923
I don't care if her superstitions
make her feel better.

26:30.048 --> 26:32.550
- I just want her to think more clearly.
- Oh.

Maybe that can make her
as happy as you are.

Patient must have Cushing's. We have
to figure out whether it's based in...

30:17.650 --> 30:20.778
A cat's nose is powerful, could smell
liver or kidney failure.

30:20.904 --> 30:23.698
Exactly. Except that if you'd glanced
at the nursing home files

30:23.823 --> 30:24.782
I had faxed over
this morning,

30:24.908 --> 30:27.410
you'd know that most of the patients'
livers and kidneys were fine.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.204
- What else?
- The MRIs aren't telling us

30:29.329 --> 30:31.247
if the Cushing's is in
her adrenals or her brain.

30:31.372 --> 30:32.665
So check her ACTH.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.292
The cat's vision
is at the blue end of the spectrum.

30:34.417 --> 30:37.170
ACTH is 11.7.
It's too close to tell.

don't have an MBA,

31:56.291 --> 31:58.209

32:15.643 --> 32:17.103
it wouldn't be
some quick payoff.

32:17.228 --> 32:20.857
Yeah, I know. I know it's not gonna
change my life overnight.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.901
I just need to
start changing it.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.489
Okay, then.
Let's start.

32:32.118 --> 32:35.830
What exactly are you hoping to find
inside your dead coma guy?

32:35.955 --> 32:40.043
Catnip, chew toy... I don't know,
that's why I'm looking.

32:41.169 --> 32:43.963
Your patient had a cardiac arrest
during the venous sampling.

32:44.088 --> 32:46.716
We got her back, but
her heart's still tenuous.

32:46.841 --> 32:49.093
- That tell us anything?
- She's weak, possibly dying.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.928
So nothing.

32:51.054 --> 32:53.765
- What about the ACTH?
- Slightly elevated.

32:53.890 --> 32:56.017
It confirms the Cushing's
is in the brain. Go.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.227
Are you sure
that it's Cushing's?

32:58.353 --> 33:00.897
You'd expect central body obesity,
she's in good shape.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.733
If it had a normal presentation,
there wouldn't be a cat involved.

33:03.858 --> 33:04.942
So it's the brain,

33:05.068 --> 33:07.945
means the next question is whether
to remove her pituitary right now...

33:08.071 --> 33:11.866
That's not a question for me,
that's a question for the patient.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.951
Now present both sides,
let her decide.

33:14.077 --> 33:15.203
All right.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.792
I've got to stop
telling you my theories.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.502
You always just
try to prove me wrong.

33:22.627 --> 33:25.963

getting bigger at the full moon?

33:26.089 --> 33:27.965
I confirmed that one,

Normally, you'd be up
in the patient room,

on what to do,

in some irrelevant dead guy,

33:33.846 --> 33:36.683

connected to a magic cat,

33:36.808 --> 33:39.060
because you want to prove to me
that you don't care.

33:39.185 --> 33:42.855

a scientific mystery.

33:43.606 --> 33:45.066

your obsessions,

33:45.191 --> 33:47.026
I even encourage them,
for one reason,

33:47.151 --> 33:51.614
they save lives. I don't know
what you're doing now.

33:59.205 --> 34:02.917
CHASE: Cushing's means your body is
overproducing a hormone called cortisol.

34:03.042 --> 34:06.337
The recommended course of action
is to suppress it with drugs.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.464
And that will cure it?

34:08.589 --> 34:11.342
Just treat it.
It could come back.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.928
The only permanent solution is

34:14.053 --> 34:16.723
to cut into your brain and remove
your pituitary gland,

34:16.848 --> 34:19.016
but surgery's dangerous.

34:19.142 --> 34:22.061
Your heart stopped
on the table once already.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.689
I want the surgery.

34:25.189 --> 34:28.609
This thing is gonna kill me
if I don't kill it first.

34:30.653 --> 34:32.321
Because of the cat?

34:33.990 --> 34:37.034
Do you wanna tell me
what an idiot I'm being?

34:37.160 --> 34:38.119
No.

34:39.746 --> 34:43.583

that science can't understand,

that have happened to me.

35:02.310 --> 35:06.939
I don't know what that reason is,
but I know that if there isn't one,

35:07.607 --> 35:10.526
if there's no greater
purpose in the world,

35:12.028 --> 35:14.572
then it's not a world

my resignation?

35:59.283 --> 36:00.827
Easier this way.

36:00.952 --> 36:03.454
It avoids the whole thing
where you panic, run back and grovel,

36:03.579 --> 36:06.332
and I punish you,
and then take you back.

36:09.377 --> 36:10.586

was a receptionist, a temp.

- He's in custody.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.580
I really am not
supposed to say anything else.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.457
I went to
high school with him.

38:11.582 --> 38:14.043
That's what everyone
else thought, too.

38:14.168 --> 38:17.004
I'm guessing you also
cured his ear problem?

38:18.422 --> 38:21.092

the money yet?

38:21.217 --> 38:22.593
No.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.355
I was right,

38:34.480 --> 38:37.316
and more satisfyingly,
you were wrong.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.527
It was coincidence.

38:39.652 --> 38:42.446
That cat was not
predicting deaths,

38:42.571 --> 38:43.739
it was just trying
to keep warm.

38:43.948 --> 38:46.492
Yes, dead people are
renowned for their warm glow.

38:46.617 --> 38:48.619
They are
if they're feverish,

38:48.744 --> 38:50.371
like three of
the patients were.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.874
Or if they are wasting away,
like the other eight.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.668
- Wasting doesn't...
- It does,

38:55.793 --> 38:59.171
if it means someone sticks
a heating blanket on you.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.549
(SIGHS)

39:01.674 --> 39:03.968
Congrats. Because of your
crazy obsession with this cat

39:04.093 --> 39:05.761
you've solved
a completely trivial mystery.

39:05.886 --> 39:08.222
Completely trivial?

39:08.347 --> 39:11.976
My God, it's clearly
only partially trivial.

39:12.643 --> 39:14.562
Debbie climbed
on Morgan, too,

39:14.687 --> 39:15.771
which means
she was overheated.

39:15.896 --> 39:19.442
So what causes flushing,
mimics every Cushing's symptom

39:19.567 --> 39:21.777
except central
body obesity?

39:23.446 --> 39:24.613
Cancer.

39:24.739 --> 39:28.034
A corticotropin-producing
carcinoid tumor of the intestine.

39:28.159 --> 39:30.995
But your pillcam
didn't find anything.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.457
Means it must be somewhere
the pillcam couldn't go.

39:34.999 --> 39:36.625
The appendix.

39:36.751 --> 39:39.754
Congratulations.
You probably saved her life.

39:39.879 --> 39:42.715
You definitely
saved her needless surgery.

39:43.466 --> 39:44.842
Yes, I did.

39:46.135 --> 39:48.304
What's the OR
extension number?

39:48.429 --> 39:49.555
Just curious.

39:59.690 --> 40:00.858
Thank you.

40:02.443 --> 40:06.363
I wouldn't come here for thanks,
that would be ungracious.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.658
It's more about gloating.

40:10.367 --> 40:13.079
You were about to cut out
a piece of your brain

40:13.204 --> 40:15.873
just to chase some
crazy superstition.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.084
But I didn't.

40:18.209 --> 40:21.796
You didn't didn't
do anything. I stopped it.

40:23.047 --> 40:25.091
And what made you do that?

40:25.382 --> 40:28.719
Science. Logic. Reason.
Pick any three.

40:28.844 --> 40:33.474
A cat chooses that exact moment
to sit on your computer.

40:33.599 --> 40:36.018
Maybe that's science
and logic and reason,

40:36.143 --> 40:38.145
or maybe it's
something else.

40:41.732 --> 40:43.400
You're an idiot.

40:46.695 --> 40:49.615
I looked up the preacher
from New York State.

40:50.825 --> 40:53.077
His followers
never faded out.

40:53.202 --> 40:55.412
They became the
Seventh-Day Adventists.

40:55.538 --> 40:58.833
A major religion.
That man changed the course of history.

40:58.958 --> 41:02.586
Because his followers
were as deluded as he was.

41:05.756 --> 41:08.801
Maybe he just gave them
something to live for.

41:12.346 --> 41:13.848
Feel better.

41:19.854 --> 41:21.063
(SIGHS)

41:49.341 --> 41:50.759
Kutner!

41:58.350 --> 42:00.186
Cat pee on my chair?

42:00.311 --> 42:02.688
- Blood on my face?
- Fake blood.

42:07.693 --> 42:09.778
You pay for
the dry-cleaning.

42:16.911 --> 42:18.787
Why are you
still alive?

42:18.913 --> 42:19.914
I'm not sure.

42:20.039 --> 42:22.541
I guess he was impressed
you stood up to him.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.585
And got a cat
to pee on his chair.

42:24.710 --> 42:27.379
Yeah. A cat.

42:38.265 --> 42:40.184
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

43:06.001 --> 43:07.002
(PURRS)
