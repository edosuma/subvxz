that you take his 2:00 p.m.

17:52.303 --> 17:53.887
-in the conference room.
-Who's in there?

17:53.887 --> 17:56.303
Mayoral candidate
Bette Porter.

17:56.303 --> 17:57.595
Isn't she
trailing Milner?

17:57.595 --> 17:59.261
She is, but she's poised
to close the gap.

18:00.637 --> 18:04.095
Brbe L.A.'s first female mayor.d

18:04.095 --> 18:05.845
She's also the first
openly gay candidate.

18:05.845 --> 18:07.595
Her views are
very progressive.

18:09.929 --> 18:11.720
Ms. Porter.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.011
Dani Nùñez,

18:14.011 --> 18:16.136
-Director of Communications.
-Pleasure to meet you.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.178
This is Pierce Williams,
my campaign manager.

18:18.178 --> 18:20.387
Yeah, I believe we met
on Garcetti's first bid.

18:20.387 --> 18:22.136
-Yes. Good to see you again.
-[chuckles] Likewise.

18:22.136 --> 18:24.970
My father's deeply sorry,
but he won't be able to make it.

18:24.970 --> 18:28.261
Oh, well, I hope
everything's okay.

18:28.261 --> 18:31.220
I'm sure it will be.
Please, have a seat.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.428
[clears throat]

18:33.428 --> 18:35.887
So you work
for your father?

18:37.553 --> 18:39.136
I do.

18:39.136 --> 18:41.553
I like to think
I was bred for the job.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.053
I studied Communications
at Stanford

18:43.053 --> 18:45.428
and then I did my
graduate work at USC,

18:45.428 --> 18:47.845
but it is possible there was
some nepotism involved,

18:47.845 --> 18:49.637
if that's what you're thinking.

18:52.512 --> 18:54.303
[producer]
You feel close? Do you feel it?

18:54.303 --> 18:55.470
[Alice]
No. No.

18:55.470 --> 18:57.178
None of them
are right. No.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.512
-They don't feel like me.
-At least Dr. Oz

18:59.512 --> 19:01.011
is a vaginal steaming advocate.

19:01.011 --> 19:03.804
I did vaginal
rejuvenation in '04.

19:03.804 --> 19:05.762
Have vaginas changed since then?

19:05.762 --> 19:06.845
No, they have not.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.762
-No.
-I know it sucks, but,

19:08.762 --> 19:10.512
hopefully, if we give the
network this win,

19:10.512 --> 19:11.762
they'll be more inclined

19:11.762 --> 19:13.136
to allow us
to stretch to include

19:13.136 --> 19:15.011
more politically-minded
candidates.

19:15.011 --> 19:17.345
Right, like my beloved
Roxane Gay.

19:17.345 --> 19:18.345
Exactly.

19:18.345 --> 19:19.929
I got a phone call this morning

19:19.929 --> 19:21.512
from an old friend of mine
from grad school.

19:21.512 --> 19:25.095
She's working as an aide
to a very interesting person.

19:25.095 --> 19:27.220
Okay, listening.

19:27.220 --> 19:29.011
The network wants
to broaden our demographic.

19:29.011 --> 19:31.553
They want to attract a more
far-reaching audience, right?

19:31.553 --> 19:34.178
Alice wants to keep it
queer, queer-adjacent,

19:34.178 --> 19:36.178
uh, social, political.

19:36.178 --> 19:38.512
Who's it gonna be?
I smell an Obama coming.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.553
Kamala.

19:42.553 --> 19:44.887
Can you get her?

19:44.887 --> 19:48.512
Yeah. I interviewed her
for a documentary I made

19:48.512 --> 19:51.303
on criminal justice reform
back when she was a D.A.

19:51.303 --> 19:54.053
This is amazing.
You have to book her.

19:54.053 --> 19:56.136
I cannot wait
to ask her

19:56.136 --> 19:59.303
real but also
inappropriate questions.

19:59.303 --> 20:00.220
-Right?
-Oh, my God.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.845
I'm so glad you're
here this season.

20:02.845 --> 20:04.845
It's all happening.
[chuckles]

20:04.845 --> 20:07.261
I'll keep Dr. Oz warm,
just as a backup.

20:07.261 --> 20:08.845
-Okay, we're not. Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

20:08.845 --> 20:10.387
Okay, let's get
some questions.

20:10.387 --> 20:12.220
Let's go.

20:12.220 --> 20:13.637
We want to convert
the Lincoln Heights Jail

20:13.637 --> 20:15.053
to expand our
corporate offices.

20:15.053 --> 20:17.261
We know it's been
a hotly contested area,

20:17.261 --> 20:18.720
but we do have capital in place

20:18.720 --> 20:20.428
to invest in a project
of that scale.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.136
I just, I have to ask: What's
the source of your capital?

20:24.136 --> 20:26.261
My father's
political contributions,

20:26.261 --> 20:27.428
they're made through
our foundation,

20:27.428 --> 20:29.929
entirely separate
from our family's company.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.428
I don't think
you answered the question.

20:32.428 --> 20:35.387
We have a diverse portfolio.

20:35.387 --> 20:37.095
Investments in everything from

20:37.095 --> 20:39.178
biomedical research
to agriculture...

20:39.178 --> 20:40.929
And the funding
for the biomedical research,

20:40.929 --> 20:43.595
does that come from the sale
of pharmaceuticals?

20:43.595 --> 20:46.261
We design prosthetics for
Wounded Warriors, Ms. Porter.

20:46.261 --> 20:49.929
I understand,
but do you also invest

20:49.929 --> 20:52.095
in the production of opioids?

20:52.095 --> 20:55.679
Prosthetics don't pay
for themselves.

21:00.679 --> 21:03.637
I see.

21:06.553 --> 21:09.470
Our only interest here
is finding the best person

21:09.470 --> 21:11.303
to run this city,

21:11.303 --> 21:13.303
and we believe
that person is you.

21:13.303 --> 21:16.428
I'm not buying
what you're selling.

21:16.428 --> 21:18.845
Our current mayor bought it.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.095
I'm not him.

21:23.470 --> 21:24.804
Ms. Porter.

21:24.804 --> 21:28.470
Do you know why
I'm running for office?

21:28.470 --> 21:31.178
I can't say that I do.

21:31.178 --> 21:32.637
It's because of people like you.

21:32.637 --> 21:35.970
The products you're pushing
are the cause of suffering.

21:35.970 --> 21:37.887
They have contributed
to the worst opioid crisis

21:37.887 --> 21:39.804
our city has ever faced,

21:39.804 --> 21:42.428
and that property that you want
to turn into corporate offices,

21:42.428 --> 21:44.887
that could be used as
a long-term rehab facility.

21:44.887 --> 21:48.470
And while I might understand
the willful ignorance

21:48.470 --> 21:51.720
of a straight white man, I'm
having a hard time understanding

21:51.720 --> 21:53.220
how you could
turn a blind eye.

21:53.220 --> 21:57.178
So I guess what
I really want to know is

21:57.178 --> 21:59.804
how the hell
do you sleep at night?

22:11.303 --> 22:13.345
[door closes]

22:14.428 --> 22:17.178
My job is to introduce you
to potential donors.

22:17.178 --> 22:18.512
Nùñez is
a big player.

22:18.512 --> 22:22.178
I've told you, I'm never
taking money from big pharma.

22:22.178 --> 22:24.095
I know you have a sensitivity
around that particular issue,

22:24.095 --> 22:25.512
-but you need...
-Fuck sensitivity.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.303
Don't ever set up another
meeting like that again.

22:27.303 --> 22:30.053
I am not willing,
under any circumstances,

22:30.053 --> 22:32.178
to compromise
my values.

22:32.178 --> 22:33.553
Noted.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.929
-That meeting never happened.
-Never happened.

22:36.929 --> 22:39.804
-Never happened.
-Never happened.

22:47.053 --> 22:49.387
[indistinct conversation]

22:56.011 --> 22:58.053
Well, that was
a fucking shitshow.

22:58.053 --> 22:59.428
-I'm sorry, Dani...
-In the future,

22:59.428 --> 23:01.553
you need to either
take those meetings yourself

23:01.553 --> 23:04.929
or prep me better.
She made me feel like an idiot.

23:04.929 --> 23:06.762
-Where were you, Dad?
-We have a problem.

23:06.762 --> 23:08.053
What is it?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.887
One of our employee's
sons overdosed.

23:09.887 --> 23:12.053
You're going to
take point on this.

23:12.053 --> 23:14.095
Get ahead of it
as much as you can.

23:14.095 --> 23:16.762
I need you to handle
him for us.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.428
-I understand.
-Okay.

23:26.762 --> 23:28.053
[Dani]
Jack.

23:28.053 --> 23:31.011
-Hi.
-I can't believe this.

23:31.011 --> 23:34.595
I just saw him,
and he'd been clean, and...

23:34.595 --> 23:37.595
-I did this.
-No, you didn't.

23:37.595 --> 23:41.178
Yeah, I did. We did. I mean...

23:41.178 --> 23:42.887
-this is all our fault.
-Jack.

23:42.887 --> 23:43.929
Stop.

23:47.345 --> 23:50.553
Sit down.

23:50.553 --> 23:52.553
[sighs]

24:00.595 --> 24:03.512
That is exactly what the media
wants you to think.

24:03.512 --> 24:07.470
They'll try to connect your work
here with your son's death.

24:10.470 --> 24:12.136
But they're wrong.

24:18.053 --> 24:19.637
-Jack...
-Yeah.

24:19.637 --> 24:21.887
...you know what we do here.

24:21.887 --> 24:24.804
We are not the bad guys.

24:24.804 --> 24:27.136
Me, you, my father?

24:27.136 --> 24:29.387
We are a family, too.

24:29.387 --> 24:31.637
You can't let them
tear us apart.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.512
Yeah, I know, I know,
but what we do here...

24:33.512 --> 24:34.845
Stop. Listen to me.

24:34.845 --> 24:36.970
Your son cannot

24:36.970 --> 24:39.095
be a statistic.

24:39.095 --> 24:42.929
He was a person.
He was your son.

24:44.929 --> 24:48.595
Yeah, he was.

24:48.595 --> 24:50.929
He was...

24:50.929 --> 24:53.887
my little boy.

24:53.887 --> 24:56.053
Exactly.

24:56.053 --> 24:58.595
You're right. [chuckles]

25:00.178 --> 25:03.428
Now tell me,
what did he love to do?

25:03.428 --> 25:05.804
[laughs] Uh...

25:07.178 --> 25:08.512
Mikey was a person.

25:08.512 --> 25:11.303
He was not a salacious
news story.

25:11.303 --> 25:14.345
He loved life. He loved
to fish, play chess.

25:14.345 --> 25:15.553
[reporter] Please
believe me when I say

25:15.553 --> 25:18.595
that I am deeply sorry
for your loss.

25:18.595 --> 25:20.845
[Jack] He was funny,
and he was loved.

25:20.845 --> 25:23.428
Mikey was special.

25:23.428 --> 25:25.220
He's handling this
very well.

25:25.220 --> 25:27.637
Mm-mm.
That's not him.

25:27.637 --> 25:29.428
That's the woman
you met earlier.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.428
He's been coached.

25:30.428 --> 25:34.553
Too bad she works
for the wrong side.

25:34.553 --> 25:37.345
[Jack] ...death of
my son was a tragedy

25:37.345 --> 25:39.553
that has nothing to do
with my work.

25:39.553 --> 25:42.970
[reporter] Thank you very much
for giving us your time today.

25:42.970 --> 25:45.553
You did good.

25:45.553 --> 25:47.553
Thanks, Dad.

25:55.261 --> 25:57.387
[water swishing, spits]

25:59.845 --> 26:02.595
[Jose]
Come on. [grunts]

26:06.637 --> 26:07.595
Shit.

26:21.679 --> 26:23.512
-Dammit.
-Oh, wait, here.

26:23.512 --> 26:25.136
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.
-Let me help.

26:25.136 --> 26:27.261
No, no, it's okay.
Um, here, give me that one.

26:27.261 --> 26:28.595
-[grunts]
-Yeah.

26:28.595 --> 26:32.470
Thank you. You s...
You sure you got both of those?

26:32.470 --> 26:35.428
Yeah, um, yeah.
Here. See?

26:35.428 --> 26:37.470
Okay.

26:39.470 --> 26:42.220
These-these are beautiful,
by the way, these are gorgeous.

26:42.220 --> 26:43.637
Thank you.
My ex hated them.

26:43.637 --> 26:45.261
They thought they took up
too much space.

26:45.261 --> 26:48.220
No, these are amazing. Where
are you moving from, by the way?

26:48.220 --> 26:49.804
-Echo Park.
-Oh, Echo Park!

26:49.804 --> 26:52.428
I love Echo Park. Oh, my God,
no, I got friends...

26:55.637 --> 26:56.720
-Oh...
-Oh, my God.

26:57.970 --> 27:01.011
That's okay.

27:01.011 --> 27:02.387
-It's fine.
-I'm so sorry.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.679
It's okay, I can fix it.
I'm the new property manager.

27:04.679 --> 27:06.804
-So...
-Okay.

27:06.804 --> 27:09.136
Good. That's good.

27:09.136 --> 27:11.637
Well, if you need me

27:11.637 --> 27:14.303
to break anything else,

27:14.303 --> 27:16.345
you know where I live.

27:16.345 --> 27:17.345
Noted.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.762
[laughs]

27:19.762 --> 27:22.929
Um, would you want
to grab dinner later?

27:22.929 --> 27:25.178
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

27:25.178 --> 27:28.095
Sure. Where you guys going?

27:29.970 --> 27:33.178
Oh, them. Yes.

27:33.178 --> 27:36.845
I will ask them
where they want to go.

27:38.345 --> 27:42.136
You know, or it could
just maybe be you and me,

27:42.136 --> 27:43.762
and not them.

27:43.762 --> 27:46.845
Yeah. Sure.

27:46.845 --> 27:48.512
Sounds fun.

27:48.512 --> 27:49.512
Yeah.

27:51.261 --> 27:53.679
Oh, um, and this is
weird timing, probably,

27:53.679 --> 27:56.845
but our stove light's been out
for a few years...

27:56.845 --> 27:59.261
If you don't mind, maybe...

27:59.261 --> 28:01.679
I'll add it to the list.

28:01.679 --> 28:03.220
Cool.

28:06.887 --> 28:07.929
[Alice]
Fuck!

28:07.929 --> 28:09.470
She really said no?

28:09.470 --> 28:13.261
Kamala's not interested
in doing this kind  of show.

28:13.261 --> 28:15.553
What kind is that?
Like a fun, feminist one

28:15.553 --> 28:17.053
where you can drink
coffee and wine?

28:17.053 --> 28:20.637
She thinks it's too small
for where she's at right now.

28:20.637 --> 28:22.303
-Oh, that is fucked.
-I know.

28:22.303 --> 28:23.637
Yeah. No. Uh-uh.

28:23.637 --> 28:25.178
You know what, though?
What's more fucked

28:25.178 --> 28:26.637
is you said you could get her.

28:26.637 --> 28:28.804
I had reason to believe
that she'd say yes.

28:28.804 --> 28:30.887
I-I interviewed her
when she ran for senate.

28:30.887 --> 28:33.428
I have a personal relationship
with her aide, I mean--

28:33.428 --> 28:35.303
But this is a totally
different platform.

28:35.303 --> 28:37.887
-I know. Just--
-No, Sophie,

28:37.887 --> 28:40.136
you can't overpromise me things.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.929

51:47.804 --> 51:51.220
that my job was
to protect the company

51:51.220 --> 51:53.512
that afforded me
the life that I have.

51:53.512 --> 51:56.970
Protect the people who helped
build it from the ground up.

51:56.970 --> 51:59.762
Go on.

52:01.428 --> 52:03.804
[sighs]

52:03.804 --> 52:06.804
You asked me the other day
how I sleep at night,

52:06.804 --> 52:09.053
but the truth is,

52:09.053 --> 52:10.970
I don't.

52:12.387 --> 52:14.929
I am damn good at my job,

52:14.929 --> 52:18.303
but I want to work
for someone I believe in.

52:18.303 --> 52:21.178
And I came here today
because I believe in you.

52:35.762 --> 52:39.178
I'm not so sure
that I trust you.

52:43.804 --> 52:46.011
You've started
your professional life

52:46.011 --> 52:48.345
in a compromised industry.

52:48.345 --> 52:50.178
I know.

52:52.804 --> 52:57.845
But if you want to win,
I think you need me.
