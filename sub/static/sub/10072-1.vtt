05:27.980 --> 05:30.819
- Get out of the car! Get out!
- Satchel, come on, we have to go.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.299
We have to move. Come on.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.902
Get down!

05:36.420 --> 05:39.751
Go! Go, go, go!

05:42.340 --> 05:45.511
Satchel? Are you okay?

05:45.860 --> 05:48.459
Are you okay? Oh, my God.

05:48.460 --> 05:51.219
- Come here.
- Oh, my God.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.659
I can't see.

05:52.660 --> 05:55.019
- What? Satchel?
- I can't see!

05:55.020 --> 05:57.699
Oh, Satchel... Is he okay?

05:57.700 --> 05:59.699
Keep your eyes closed, all right?

05:59.700 --> 06:02.219
Don't look at anything. It's
just gonna hurt your eyes.

06:02.220 --> 06:05.107
- Okay.
- Satchel?

06:05.380 --> 06:07.391
Come here.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.939
- It's okay. I've got you.
- We need to get off the road and find shelter.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.539
We can't do that on foot.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.699
I need to call our family,
let them know we're okay.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.419
Cell phones won't work.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.979
- Nothing electronic will.
- Why did this happen?

06:23.980 --> 06:25.019
That's not important now.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.059
We only have an hour or so before
the radiation starts coming in.

06:28.060 --> 06:31.059
Food, water, supplies, a diesel
vehicle are the priority.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.659
Well, what about the Interstate?
We could, uh, find someone to help us.

06:34.660 --> 06:37.099
No. We need to stay away
from populated areas

06:37.100 --> 06:38.339
until we know what's going on.

06:38.340 --> 06:40.305
Oh, fine.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.219
- Come here.
- Here, hold this, okay? Just stay right here.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.379
All right.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.982
Hold this, right there.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.780
All right. Oh, shit!

07:15.860 --> 07:18.110
No keys.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.861
- Hey, see if you can find me a screwdriver.
- Okay. All right.

07:25.260 --> 07:26.907
Perfect.

07:32.380 --> 07:35.739
Hopefully this works,
Jennifer and Satchel.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.359
Let's see if this
thing has some gas.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.380
- Hop on in.
- Great.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.181
Here. Follow me, okay?

08:10.940 --> 08:14.305
I... I still can't see.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.582
Is, uh... Is this normal?

08:21.020 --> 08:23.270
Yeah, you'll be all right.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.259
Come on, come on.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.859
- Where you going?
- Okay, okay.

08:43.860 --> 08:47.299
All right, I need you to find bottled
water, tuna, peanut butter, um,

08:47.300 --> 08:49.099
beef jerky. Anything high
in protein, all right?

08:49.100 --> 08:50.419
No junk food, no empty calories.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.619
No, stay in the car.
Stay in the car.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.779
Find any kind of batteries you can.
Um, baby wipes. We need baby wipes.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.303
- Okay... Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay? Let's go.

10:20.260 --> 10:24.910
- Where are you headed?
- Waco. My car won't start.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.345
How many did you see go off?

10:27.620 --> 10:29.221
There were two to the east,

10:29.860 --> 10:32.939
by the Dyess air base in Abilene.

10:32.940 --> 10:35.939
One to the north. Uh, I don't
know, maybe Oklahoma City...

10:35.940 --> 10:41.068
And a whole bunch of huge ones to
the south. Probably Dallas, Fort Worth.

10:43.180 --> 10:45.509
They really got us this
time, didn't they?

10:50.460 --> 10:55.190
Look, we need to get somewhere
safe. You can hop in the back.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.026
Okay.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.942
Hello?

11:43.260 --> 11:44.861
Hello?

11:46.180 --> 11:49.779
- Please go away. Go away.
- No, no, no. We just need to find a basement.

11:49.780 --> 11:51.819
Oh, my God!

11:51.820 --> 11:55.659
- Oh, God! Oh, my God! Holy shit!
- Go, go, go!

11:55.660 --> 11:57.299
Are you okay? Are you shot?

11:57.300 --> 12:00.551
Just go! Come on. We
got to get out of here!

12:13.260 --> 12:16.306
- Hey!
- I know what you're looking for.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.419
What about this place?

12:25.420 --> 12:28.341
We're running out of time.
It'll have to do.

12:32.740 --> 12:36.503
- Where are we?
- It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be all right.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.340
Hello?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.381
Hey.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.621
Hey.

13:08.940 --> 13:11.259
- Don't shoot.
- Get the fuck out of here.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.669
I'm a fucking doctor. Okay?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.319
Come on, Mr. Franklins.
He said he was a doctor.

13:29.620 --> 13:33.986
Now, I've been shot once today
and I'm not gonna be shot again!

13:34.820 --> 13:38.619
Now, we have our own food
and we have a lot of water.

13:38.620 --> 13:42.747
We just need a place
to stay. And I'm a doctor.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.587
- I can help you.
- Brad, just let him in!

13:46.660 --> 13:48.591
He said he had food.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.983
We got our own water.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.344
We got a water pump!

13:58.180 --> 14:00.139
If you have a water
pump, it's well water.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.583
It will be irradiated soon.
It's not gonna be safe.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.019
Look,

14:05.020 --> 14:08.539
I got a sick kid and his sister in the
truck. You have a cellar, right?

14:08.540 --> 14:10.619
Yeah, uh-huh. That's
where we've been staying

14:10.620 --> 14:12.419
since the nukes went off.

14:12.420 --> 14:14.259
- Get them down there and stay.
- Okay.

14:14.260 --> 14:16.703
My name's Jonathan.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.660
Okay.

14:20.900 --> 14:24.947
Is your cellar over there?
Look, Elizabeth, come here.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.939
All right, we need to cover this with
dirt. Pull the truck around back.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.339
Anything else around
there, all right?

14:32.340 --> 14:33.699
Just get the shovels
out and cover them.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.825
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.339
Look, all the food and water
I have is in the truck.

14:39.340 --> 14:42.341
It needs to be in the cellar, now.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.066
- What's your name? Angie.
- Angie.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.819
I need you to go upstairs,
like, go in the bathrooms,

14:52.820 --> 14:55.579
get all the towels, all the clothes. Get
them down into the cellar, all right?

14:55.580 --> 14:57.830
Okay. I'll get everything.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.379
- Hey.
- Yeah.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.339
We need more shovels, all right?

15:02.340 --> 15:05.546
Okay, yeah, I have
one in the cellar.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.739
Whose house is this?

15:25.740 --> 15:29.025
It's my grandma and
grandpa's house.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.979
- Where are they?
- Oh, uh, my grandpa has leukemia,

15:32.980 --> 15:36.979
so he's at Dallas at the hospital.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.659
Grandma's with him, but...

15:39.660 --> 15:43.899
- They're probably dead by now.
- I'm sorry.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.779
I'm just kidding. They're
dead! That's for sure.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.064
Could you stop being
an asshole and dig?

15:56.300 --> 15:57.947
Bitch.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.786
Charming.

16:02.940 --> 16:04.541
Who's the moron?

16:04.780 --> 16:06.299
He's our neighbor.

16:06.300 --> 16:11.139
They don't have a cellar, because a lot
of people around here don't have cellars.

16:11.140 --> 16:14.584
But we have a cellar, so...

16:15.260 --> 16:17.544
Great.

16:35.020 --> 16:37.299
- Angie, right?
- I got all the towels.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.425
I don't think there's
any more up here.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.139
How far along are you?

16:44.140 --> 16:45.499
About seven months.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.263
A little more than that.
Like eleven days or so.

16:50.060 --> 16:51.661
Hey, hold on.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.344
Let me see that.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.066
That's fine.

17:09.619 --> 17:11.019
All right, give the, uh...

17:11.020 --> 17:14.271
Give the medicine to the blonde
woman I came with. The calm one.

17:40.420 --> 17:44.339
- Hey, do you think he's gonna be okay...
- Yeah, he's fine.

17:44.340 --> 17:46.305
Is that everything?

17:47.220 --> 17:50.141
Truck's empty. What?

17:51.220 --> 17:53.549
Relax.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.823
Thank God I'm in Texas.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.539
This is my granduncle, Wendell.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.619
He lives with us now

20:15.620 --> 20:19.219
because we couldn't afford a
home for him after the VA cuts.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.899
Pleased to meet you, sir.

20:20.900 --> 20:24.619
Listen, Doc, uh, he's a diabetic.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.179
We have insulin, but we might...

20:26.180 --> 20:27.827
- Don't worry about it.
- Here.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.419
We got all the food and water down.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.939
You have some more
kerosene lamps upstairs.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.019
We need them down here.

20:33.020 --> 20:36.339
Those are Grandma's. She's
really into that antique stuff.

20:36.340 --> 20:39.139
But we gotta make sure that
we don't break any of it

20:39.140 --> 20:41.579
- 'cause if she comes back, then, um...
- Doc...

20:41.580 --> 20:43.830
Doc.

20:44.380 --> 20:47.579
I got a question. You, uh,
took my pistol, remember?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.499
Yeah, don't worry
about it. I still got it.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.340
Yeah, so do I get a gun?

20:52.700 --> 20:58.306
Tell you what, you go a week without
shooting at me again and I'll think about it.

21:21.260 --> 21:24.431
Well! That's real nice.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.979
Sure good to be able to
see everybody's faces.

21:28.980 --> 21:32.259
Yeah, but there's only, uh, three car
batteries, so we have to conserve.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.908
How long do we have
to stay down here?

21:36.260 --> 21:40.228
We are never gettin'
out of here, honey.

21:42.740 --> 21:44.466
At least a month.

21:44.780 --> 21:47.906
Depends how widespread all this is.

21:47.940 --> 21:53.307
The, uh, blast radiation isn't good,
but the fallout is a bigger problem.

21:53.580 --> 21:59.019
When a nuclear bomb goes off,
it sucks up dirt and debris into the air

21:59.020 --> 22:02.179
that falls back down like snow.

22:02.180 --> 22:05.059
It's really radioactive,
and it's a particulate.

22:05.060 --> 22:07.549
You... You breathe it in.

22:08.820 --> 22:11.779
Oh, my God, dude!

22:11.780 --> 22:15.145
Watch out, guys! We can't even
fucking breathe in here now!

22:15.180 --> 22:18.339
I was watching Fox News and

22:18.340 --> 22:21.910
it sounded like it was
pretty widespread.

22:22.100 --> 22:25.379
Well, I knew about that
magnopulse thing, so I...

22:25.380 --> 22:31.191
I put my mp3 player in the safe so that
we at least have some music to listen to.

22:31.260 --> 22:35.339
I know these things went off all
over Asia and North America.

22:35.340 --> 22:40.264
A lot in Europe, too, but I don't know
how widespread the radiation is.

22:40.340 --> 22:42.939
I saw at least five of them go off.

22:42.940 --> 22:45.699
But there's no way of knowing how
many megatons the bombs were...

22:45.700 --> 22:47.499
Uh, the wind direction
at the time of blast...

22:47.500 --> 22:51.459
I have a shortwave right
here that I'm working on.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.219
But...

22:53.220 --> 22:56.203
It might be broken, though.

23:00.403 --> 23:03.724
Grandpa's a pretty big
military collector.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.379
I don't know what all's in there.

23:05.380 --> 23:09.109
He never really lets me mess
with any of that stuff.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.579
Start nailing up the
cellar doors shut.

23:16.580 --> 23:20.309
And if you have any tape,
seal up the cracks.

23:24.220 --> 23:25.379
God damn it, man!

23:25.380 --> 23:28.419
You haven't gotten this shit all
off the fucking shelf? Man, Jesus!

23:28.420 --> 23:30.739
- Gotta take boxes off it!
- Sorry.

23:30.740 --> 23:34.503
Fucking Poindexter, man!
Get this fucking thing off!

23:35.900 --> 23:37.626
Fuck!

23:40.780 --> 23:44.384
- What are you doing, man? Get a hammer!
- I'm sorry. Here.

23:52.620 --> 23:54.585
Hey. Here.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.579
What is that?

24:01.580 --> 24:05.150
It's a Geiger counter.
It measures radiation.

24:05.620 --> 24:08.039
- Well, the door's boarded tight.
- Shh!

24:16.620 --> 24:18.221
The fallout.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.819
Are you fucking crazy?

25:20.820 --> 25:24.099
You're gonna make my wife
piss in a goddamn bucket?

25:24.100 --> 25:27.019
Come on, Mr. Franklins. You
know we can't go upstairs.

25:27.020 --> 25:29.899
Hey, Professor Oppenheimer,
this is the best we can do.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.059
I don't know if you've noticed,
but we don't have a toilet.

25:32.060 --> 25:36.301
Kerosene is less dense than water,
urine, or shit, so it'll stay on top.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.948
All right, you can go in.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.709
- And thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:00.220 --> 26:04.222
Maybe you should try fixing
the, uh, shortwave radio.

26:05.140 --> 26:07.265
Okay.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.059
Is he gonna be okay?

26:10.060 --> 26:15.348
His retinas were too badly burned in
the blast. He was looking directly at it.

26:16.780 --> 26:21.510
Do you think we should tell him?
I mean, he's been asking me.

26:21.660 --> 26:24.422
I'm gonna go check on Angie.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.585
Here, baby.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.389
I'm tired. Oh, shit.

26:45.180 --> 26:47.339
Oh, great.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.351
Hey.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.419
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

26:52.420 --> 26:56.422
- Do you mind if I listen for a heartbeat?
- Yeah, sure.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.021
Okay.

27:00.460 --> 27:03.359
You mind taking a
deep breath for me?

27:04.060 --> 27:06.105
There we go.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.542
She's cool, right?

27:15.780 --> 27:17.620
Right?

27:18.740 --> 27:22.179
You look a little
young to be a M.D.

27:22.180 --> 27:25.059
What are you doing around here?

27:25.060 --> 27:28.459
I was finishing my residency
at New York University.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.221
Wow!

27:31.820 --> 27:33.379
New York!

27:33.380 --> 27:34.699
What?

27:34.700 --> 27:38.065
I'm not doing anything?
I'm just curious.

27:38.140 --> 27:41.459
What are you doing around these parts?
You... I saw your backpack.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.299
You on a walkabout or something?

27:44.300 --> 27:46.504
Yeah, something like that.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.740
Jesus.

27:52.580 --> 27:56.184
All right, stay...
Stay warm, honey.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.186
Thank you.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.899
We need to drink a bottle of
water and try to get some sleep.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.859
- And cover up as much as possible.
- That's...

28:25.860 --> 28:28.539
Brad, please.

28:28.540 --> 28:32.667
Can we just go to sleep?
I don't feel very well.

28:39.900 --> 28:44.027
Hey, Jonathan. Should I be
worried about those two?

28:44.380 --> 28:46.819
I don't know.

28:46.820 --> 28:51.550
Sometimes, she'll come over
here to talk to Grandma...

28:51.900 --> 28:55.982
And she's always, like, crying.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.986
Oh...

28:59.180 --> 29:05.659
Oh, um, I got the, um, shortwave
working. Well, kind of.

29:05.660 --> 29:10.106
You can use my earphones,
but you can only just listen.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.660
The microphone's not connected yet.

29:14.060 --> 29:17.823
Uh, I'm gonna go tuck in Grand Unc.

29:18.180 --> 29:20.544
- Night.
- Good night.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.980
- Here you go, Grand Unc.
- Hmm...

29:27.740 --> 29:29.910
Thank you, Jon.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.579
Are you gonna be okay, Grand Unc?

29:32.580 --> 29:36.229
I sure hope my brother's
okay out there.

29:38.620 --> 29:42.667
Ah, he'll be all right.
He's a war hero.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.259
You should've seen him.
Grandpa, Jonathan.

29:51.260 --> 29:55.831
He was the reason I
volunteered for Korea.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.748
That was a different war.

30:00.260 --> 30:04.219
- I'm gonna be sleeping behind you, okay?
- Hmm... Hmm...

30:04.220 --> 30:07.346
So if you need anything...

30:17.620 --> 30:20.791
Brad's gonna be a problem.

30:44.420 --> 30:47.339
<i>"We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men...</i>

30:47.340 --> 30:48.419
You gotta listen to this.

30:48.420 --> 30:50.699
<i>"Leaning together
Headpiece filled with...</i>

30:50.700 --> 30:52.499
Jonathan said we can just hear.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.059
<i>"...over broken glass
In our dry cellar.</i>

30:55.060 --> 30:58.579
<i>"Shape without form,
shade without...</i>

30:58.580 --> 31:00.099
<i>"...the world ends</i>

31:00.100 --> 31:06.699
<i>"This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends</i>

31:06.700 --> 31:09.279
<i>"Not with a bang, but a whimper."</i>

31:14.560 --> 31:17.139
<i>This is Shenandoah, Oklahoma.</i>

31:17.140 --> 31:19.902
<i>Is there anybody out there?</i>

31:20.060 --> 31:24.279
<i>This is Shenandoah, Oklahoma.
Is there anybody even out there?</i>

32:11.900 --> 32:14.184
- Satchel?
- Hmm?

32:14.220 --> 32:17.221
- You okay?
- Mmm-hmm. Where are we?

32:22.580 --> 32:24.545
What?

32:31.260 --> 32:33.499
- Drink some more, okay?
- Okay.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.387
It's right here. It's a bottle.

32:45.820 --> 32:48.179
What time is it? Does anybody know?

32:48.180 --> 32:51.989
Uh, yeah, it's 11:23 a.m.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.899
Shit. That's what I have, too.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.339
What do you mean, "shit"?

32:57.340 --> 33:00.147
It's almost completely
dark outside.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.179
What?

33:02.180 --> 33:04.619
It's, like, noon.

33:04.620 --> 33:07.541
Yeah. Look for yourself.

33:24.220 --> 33:26.379
That doesn't make any sense.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.425
It's the end of the world.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.939
What did you say?

33:30.940 --> 33:34.111
I said, "It's the
end of the world."

33:35.060 --> 33:37.230
You know what?

33:37.340 --> 33:40.420
You shut the fuck
up with that shit!

33:40.460 --> 33:43.939
My fucking pregnant
wife is right here.

33:43.940 --> 33:47.339
Stop with all this fucking "left
for us" bullshit, all right?

33:47.340 --> 33:49.400
You leave that to your own
psycho head, all right?

33:50.020 --> 33:54.386
- Don't talk to my sister like that!
- Hey, enough.

33:54.860 --> 33:58.779
All right? We're not gonna
get anywhere like that.

33:58.780 --> 34:02.429
It's not gonna help
this day be any better.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.990
Hey, Doc.

34:07.540 --> 34:10.018
How you doing, Wendell?
You doing all right?

34:10.020 --> 34:11.621
Ah, I'm all right.

34:12.860 --> 34:16.699
- Just a little tired from all of the excitement.
- Let me check something out.

34:16.699 --> 34:19.063
I can't complain.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.783
You're doing all right.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.025
Ah...

34:35.780 --> 34:37.659
What have you got there?

34:37.659 --> 34:41.739
Um, when this all started, I was
talking to my best friend Barry

34:41.739 --> 34:43.579
in Minnesota over IM.

34:43.580 --> 34:48.819
And he's the one who told me
about the magnetic pulse thing.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.418
He said I might be able
to save some of my stuff

34:51.420 --> 34:54.751
if I put it in a metal
safe or something.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.779
I don't know, man.
Maybe if it was lead.

34:58.780 --> 35:01.860
This radio still works.

35:05.060 --> 35:11.429
And, um, I put some of my
grandpa's .38 lead rounds in here.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.143
Here's the best part.

35:19.940 --> 35:22.030
Still works.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.221
Well, that should help
you pass the time.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.259
Really, uh...

35:38.260 --> 35:40.988
It just doesn't make any
sense, though. I mean...

35:42.580 --> 35:45.865
It's just dark,
you know? This is...

35:47.740 --> 35:50.339
This is Texas, man! It's, like...

35:50.340 --> 35:54.706
It's, like, 55 degrees
in this shit.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.059
You know what I think?

35:57.060 --> 36:00.939
The government, man...
They've gotta have, like...

36:00.940 --> 36:03.099
- There is no government.
- ...something up their sleeve.

36:03.100 --> 36:06.146
There is no government
anymore, Brad!

36:06.500 --> 36:08.139
So many of those
things have gone off

36:08.140 --> 36:10.899
that we can't even fucking
see the sun anymore!

36:10.900 --> 36:15.027
Look, there's always a
government, all right?

36:15.140 --> 36:17.819
Somebody did this to us!

36:17.820 --> 36:21.339
I wanna find out if we did
anything back to them!

36:21.340 --> 36:23.659
Who the fuck cares?

36:23.660 --> 36:26.339
Hunter and I were on the
shortwave last night,

36:26.340 --> 36:29.819
and everybody is going through the
exact same thing we are, okay?

36:29.820 --> 36:32.379
Fucking bitch! I wanna know
what the President did!

36:32.380 --> 36:35.979
I wanna know. I wanna know
what we're doing... Fuck! Ouch!

36:35.980 --> 36:37.459
- Get off of me!
- Hey, listen...

36:37.460 --> 36:39.939
Listen. Listen, all right?

36:39.940 --> 36:43.259
We're not gonna get anywhere
by yelling at each other. Listen.

36:43.260 --> 36:46.539
<i>...will provide the most
updated medical information...</i>

36:46.540 --> 36:48.819
What? You didn't tell
us we had a radio.

36:48.820 --> 36:50.259
<i>...at the top of the hour.</i>

36:50.260 --> 36:55.548

- You gonna be all right, Grand Unc?
- Yeah, I'm doing great.

37:11.780 --> 37:16.099
Hey, remember those Astros games
against the Mets I took you to last year?

37:16.100 --> 37:18.987
- Yeah.
- New York bastards!

37:19.060 --> 37:22.630
- It was a good trip.
- That was really fun.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.060
Hey.

37:25.740 --> 37:26.819
He's okay?

37:26.820 --> 37:30.344
You're okay.

37:37.580 --> 37:41.946
Astros, huh? I was always
a Royals fan, myself.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.346
Don't hold it against me.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.859
Hey, Wendell, you know the best
part about backing a losing team?

37:50.860 --> 37:52.579
What's that?

37:52.580 --> 37:54.259
Nowhere to go but up.

37:54.260 --> 37:57.670
You're pretty right, there, Doc.

38:04.340 --> 38:06.819
Oh, Hunter, the
shortwave works now.

38:06.820 --> 38:11.789
I mean, uh... I mean, the microphone's
connected, and the speaker works, too.

38:13.300 --> 38:16.471
Shenandoah, this is Cameron.
Are you there? Over.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.710
Hunter?

38:24.300 --> 38:27.585
Trying to find those
fellows from Shenandoah.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.948
Hunter, come on.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.151
Come on.

38:39.020 --> 38:41.907
Okay?

38:48.100 --> 38:51.039
Shenandoah, this is Cameron,
Texas. Are you there? Over.

39:01.020 --> 39:05.466
<i>This is Shenandoah, Oklahoma.
Is there anybody out there?</i>

39:07.380 --> 39:11.063
Shenandoah, this is Cameron.
We are here. Over.

39:12.660 --> 39:14.459
What did I tell ya?

39:14.460 --> 39:16.259
<i>What... What? Whoa! Okay.</i>

39:16.260 --> 39:18.539
<i>- Okay, hold on. Hold on.</i>
- We're not alone.

39:18.540 --> 39:22.259
<i>Hell, man! We didn't think
we'd ever raise nobody!</i>

39:22.260 --> 39:26.579

Motors, Shenandoah, Oklahoma.</i>

39:26.580 --> 39:28.999

How you doing?</i>

39:29.700 --> 39:33.082
Doing a lot better
now, Shane. Over.

39:33.140 --> 39:34.419
<i>Well, that's... That's great, man!</i>

39:34.420 --> 39:37.679
<i>I got 11 people down here in this
basement trying to get along.</i>

39:39.060 --> 39:41.499

Shit, I'm losing him.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.939
Shenandoah, come in.

Do y'all think that's even
worth listening to anymore?

40:19.060 --> 40:20.179
I mean, because they've...

40:20.180 --> 40:22.899
They've been promising an update
for an hour for, like, the past day.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.219
<i>Local authorities
are coordinating...</i>

40:24.220 --> 40:26.099
I just figure...

40:26.100 --> 40:27.459
They're just trying to figure out

40:27.460 --> 40:30.899
how to get people into
evacuation centers, you know?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.939
Hey, Jonathan.

40:32.940 --> 40:35.579
Just another minute
with this battery.

40:35.580 --> 40:39.582
We're already on our second one.
After this, we only have one left.

40:39.620 --> 40:42.299
<i>- This is the Emergency...</i>
- It's brighter outside today.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.539
<i>- Local authorities are coordinating...</i>
- That's good.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.519
<i>- ...with federal agencies and will provide...</i>
- Right?

40:47.720 --> 40:51.141
Yeah, that's, uh... That's great.

40:51.940 --> 40:55.019
Why don't we just all get in our bathing
suits and go play in the sprinklers.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.939
Brad. Stop.

40:57.940 --> 40:59.541
Sorry.

41:00.180 --> 41:02.299
Hey, Jonathan, turn off the radio.

41:02.300 --> 41:06.222
<i>Local authorities are coordinating
with federal agencies...</i>

41:14.540 --> 41:17.063
- Give me my gun.
- Shh!

41:18.460 --> 41:20.061
Hey!

41:38.100 --> 41:41.271
It's okay. It's okay.

41:41.580 --> 41:45.019
No! Hey! We have a gun!

41:45.020 --> 41:46.339
Hey, motherfucker!

41:46.340 --> 41:49.591
Hey, this is my grandparents'
house, you motherfucker!

42:02.020 --> 42:04.059
Shit! I'm sorry...

42:04.060 --> 42:06.779
I'm sorry, Jonathan!
I didn't mean to be a...

42:06.780 --> 42:09.259
I'm fucking hit!

42:09.260 --> 42:11.819
He said your fucking name!
How does he know you?

42:11.820 --> 42:15.659
- I don't know.
- Get up there! Get up there! Come on!

42:15.660 --> 42:18.339
Hey, hey... Hello...

42:18.340 --> 42:19.819
Rob?

42:19.820 --> 42:21.619
- Rob! Rob!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

42:21.620 --> 42:24.139
- It's Rob!
- What's going on up there?

42:24.140 --> 42:25.859
- Hunter.
- Brad, get up here with a hammer.

42:25.860 --> 42:28.699
- What?
- Brad, hammer! Now!

42:28.700 --> 42:30.619
- I didn't know it was you.
- Brad, hammer!

42:30.620 --> 42:33.019
Please, open the door!

42:33.020 --> 42:35.379
We're coming, Rob! Open the door.

42:35.380 --> 42:38.426
- Let us in here.
- Are you fucking crazy?

42:38.740 --> 42:41.661
Coming, Rob!

42:43.460 --> 42:46.539
Elizabeth, grab me a blanket
and a pillow and set it up here.

42:46.540 --> 42:48.259
Jennifer, get me a pillow ready.

42:48.260 --> 42:50.179
Move. Move! Move!

42:50.180 --> 42:51.699
- God damn it!
- Come on, Rob.

42:51.700 --> 42:52.899
- You should see...
- Give me.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.539
I got you. I got you.

42:54.540 --> 42:57.139
- Lay him down.
- Fuck!

42:57.140 --> 43:01.299
I'm so sorry we shot you. I'm so
sorry, Rob. I didn't know...

43:01.300 --> 43:03.219
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck are you, huh?

43:03.220 --> 43:04.259
I'm so sorry, Rob!

43:04.260 --> 43:06.679
- Huh?
- Okay, just let me deal with him!

43:08.580 --> 43:10.739
Jonathan, get out of here.
Let me deal with him.

43:10.740 --> 43:13.059
I didn't know it
was you. I'm so sorry.

43:13.060 --> 43:15.379
Everybody stop apologizing!

43:15.380 --> 43:16.579
Rob, you're in shock.

43:16.580 --> 43:18.899
I need you to just look at me
right here, okay? Let me see this.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.179
- Who is this guy?
- Let me see this.

43:21.180 --> 43:24.704
- Elizabeth, can you hold this? Thank you.
- Who is he?

43:25.140 --> 43:28.459
- I asked you a fucking question! Huh?
- Get off of him!

43:28.460 --> 43:30.619
I need to look at your wrist.

43:30.620 --> 43:33.419
He's my friend. He works at the
comic book shop on Redford.

43:33.420 --> 43:36.779
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up!

43:36.780 --> 43:38.419
Rob...

43:38.420 --> 43:42.339
Hey, Rob, Listen to me, all right?
The bullet went through your wrist.

43:42.340 --> 43:46.299
That's good. That means I'm not
gonna have to remove a bullet.

43:46.300 --> 43:48.619
I'm just gonna have to dress
your wound and clean it.

43:48.620 --> 43:49.699
They're shooting people...

43:49.700 --> 43:51.459
They're shooting people.
They're shooting people!

43:51.460 --> 43:52.619
- Hey... Hey!
- They're shooting people!

43:52.620 --> 43:55.271
Hold him down! Hold him down!

43:59.580 --> 44:01.545
Fuck!

44:08.580 --> 44:10.386
Thanks.

44:12.220 --> 44:15.824
Here, Rob. Drink this slowly, okay?

44:18.220 --> 44:20.059
I don't want it.

44:20.060 --> 44:23.859
Have they... Uh, the town,
have they set up any, um,

44:23.860 --> 44:26.419
evacuation centers or
anything like that?

44:26.420 --> 44:28.219
They tried.

44:28.220 --> 44:30.339
They used the old, uh,

44:30.340 --> 44:31.779
fallout shelter under the library,

44:31.780 --> 44:33.819
but it didn't fit everybody.

44:33.820 --> 44:35.699
There was a lot of fighting.

44:35.700 --> 44:37.379
What about the Guard?

44:37.380 --> 44:39.139
The National Guard?

44:39.140 --> 44:41.459
They're all overseas.

44:41.460 --> 44:43.425
Isn't good out there.

44:43.460 --> 44:45.699
Started with a lot of looting.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.379
Then the bubbas took over

44:47.380 --> 44:49.664
'cause they had the guns.

44:49.860 --> 44:53.384
Second night, there
was a string of rapes.

44:53.780 --> 44:56.339
And they're not letting the
old people have any food.

44:56.340 --> 45:00.103
A lot of people are in
bad shape, all burnt up.

45:00.420 --> 45:03.619
A lot of people
getting really drunk.

45:03.620 --> 45:08.299
Others are going crazy looking for
alcohol and drugs because they ran out.

45:08.300 --> 45:11.141
When did the bruises
first appear, Rob?

45:17.060 --> 45:19.150
They shot all the migrants.

45:19.700 --> 45:22.019
That's when I ran.

45:22.020 --> 45:24.619
They just lined them
up and shot 'em.

45:24.620 --> 45:27.379
Everybody's going crazy and...

45:27.380 --> 45:29.948
That's why I came here.

45:30.700 --> 45:33.379
I was so worried about you, Rob.

45:33.380 --> 45:37.899
You know, with Grandpa
and Grandma and Barry...

45:37.900 --> 45:40.229
...all dead.

45:43.580 --> 45:45.784
Please, you gotta let me stay.

45:46.460 --> 45:47.579
I'm...

45:47.580 --> 45:50.099
All the real sick people, they're...
They're straggling around the town,

45:50.100 --> 45:51.499
looking for food and water, but...

45:51.500 --> 45:54.259
I got my own bottle of water and peanut
butter in my backpack upstairs, okay?

45:54.260 --> 45:57.059
I won't even use your
food, I promise.

45:57.060 --> 45:58.991
Please?

45:59.380 --> 46:01.019
I don't wanna go back out there.

46:01.020 --> 46:06.467
This is Jonathan's home, and if he
says you can stay, you can stay.

46:08.460 --> 46:11.028
- Okay?
- Thank you.

46:13.340 --> 46:16.339
"There are wars and rumors of wars,

46:16.340 --> 46:18.659
"but be not troubled for
these things must pass."

46:18.660 --> 46:20.781
Oh...

46:26.940 --> 46:29.539
It's okay, it's okay.

46:29.540 --> 46:31.747
Shut up!

46:51.780 --> 46:53.899
It's just the radiation setting in.

46:53.900 --> 46:57.947
I'm gonna give you two amoxicillins.
It should help you fight it off.

47:02.140 --> 47:03.859
- Hey, Brad.
- What?

47:03.860 --> 47:07.059
- Is she okay?
- She's... She's fine.

47:07.060 --> 47:09.583
She's just got a little
morning sickness.

47:15.300 --> 47:19.541
- Angie, have you been able to eat anything?
- Not much.

47:20.260 --> 47:24.819
Man, she's fine. It's just harder
for her. She's gotta eat for two.

47:24.820 --> 47:27.107
Right, sweetheart?

47:32.660 --> 47:34.989
Hey, honey!

47:35.420 --> 47:36.499
She's okay.

47:36.500 --> 47:40.379
What the fuck! Hey... Hey,
sweetheart. Sweetheart, come on.

47:40.380 --> 47:43.108
Come on. You're okay! Just breathe!

47:43.180 --> 47:46.099
Angie, breathe. Come on!
You're hurting the baby! Stop!

47:46.100 --> 47:47.747
Stop.

47:49.660 --> 47:51.859
All right? Please!

47:51.860 --> 47:54.699
It's okay! Just breathe!

47:54.700 --> 47:58.459
Breathe! You're hurting the
fucking baby! Just breathe, okay?

47:58.460 --> 48:01.631
- Stop! Stop it!
- Please!

48:06.220 --> 48:08.902
- Oh, my God!
- What?

48:12.820 --> 48:16.629
- What? What are you guys looking at?
- Ange...

48:17.060 --> 48:18.821
What?

48:19.020 --> 48:22.624
Stop. What's wrong with my face?

48:22.740 --> 48:24.379
Ange...

48:24.380 --> 48:27.459
Stop, Brad! You're freaking me out!

48:27.460 --> 48:30.419
- What is wrong with my face? What?
- It's okay, it's okay.

48:30.420 --> 48:33.599
It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry.

48:33.900 --> 48:37.119
- Ange, God, I'm so sorry.
- What happened?

48:40.180 --> 48:41.827
Jennifer?

48:45.660 --> 48:48.308
Jennifer, calm down.

48:48.340 --> 48:52.387
Jennifer, breathe. Just breathe.

48:54.820 --> 48:58.469
Give me your hand.
Stay calm. Jennifer?

49:00.300 --> 49:02.709
Jennifer! Get out of the way!

49:16.620 --> 49:19.700
Oh, my God!

49:37.140 --> 49:39.504
I'm keeping the gun.

49:55.980 --> 49:59.504
Am I gonna die because she bit me?

50:00.220 --> 50:03.061
She was scared, okay?

50:03.420 --> 50:06.699
She was scared of blast burn
and radiation poisoning,

50:06.700 --> 50:08.745
and she was dying and...

50:09.460 --> 50:12.639
She's a refugee of this war.
She's not a movie zombie, okay?

50:14.180 --> 50:16.299
- Could have fooled me.
- Let me see this.

50:16.300 --> 50:19.259
What are we gonna do about her?

50:19.260 --> 50:24.149
Well, Brad and I are gonna take
her upstairs to the top floor.

50:24.780 --> 50:27.019
But I'm gonna wait for the
radiation to die down a little bit

50:27.020 --> 50:29.349
before we do that.

50:35.260 --> 50:38.019
"The soldier now blew
upon a green whistle,

50:38.020 --> 50:44.859
"and at once, a young girl, dressed in a
pretty green silk gown, entered the room.

50:44.860 --> 50:48.099
"She had lovely green
hair and green eyes,

50:48.100 --> 50:51.699
"and she bowed low before
Dorothy as she said,

50:51.700 --> 50:55.299
"'Follow me and I will
show you your room."'

50:55.300 --> 50:59.219
"So Dorothy said goodbye to all
her friends except for Toto,

50:59.220 --> 51:02.659
"taking the dog in her arms,
followed the green girl

51:02.660 --> 51:06.699
"through seven passages and
up three flights of stairs

51:06.700 --> 51:10.539
"until they came to a room
at the front of the palace.

51:10.540 --> 51:13.899
"It was the sweetest
little room in the world,

51:13.900 --> 51:15.739
"with a soft, comfortable bed...

"that had all sheets
of green silk..."

Shenandoah?

51:20.740 --> 51:23.219
This is Cameron, Texas.

51:23.220 --> 51:25.584
Shenandoah, come in.

51:31.620 --> 51:34.339
This is Cameron, Texas.
Shenandoah, come in.

51:34.340 --> 51:37.420
Hey! The story's not over yet.

51:39.060 --> 51:41.899
"...that shot a spray of green
perfume into the air...

51:41.900 --> 51:43.865
<i>Doc?</i>

51:44.620 --> 51:46.870
I'm here, Shane.

51:46.940 --> 51:50.259
- "...to fall back into a beautifully carved..."
- There's something upstairs.

51:50.260 --> 51:53.099
<i>- People moving around.</i>
- Come again?

51:53.100 --> 51:54.819
<i>They can hear us.</i>

51:54.820 --> 51:58.499
<i>A man in an army uniform
came yesterday.</i>

51:58.500 --> 52:01.459
<i>He said it was for the
sake of the nation.</i>

52:01.460 --> 52:03.699
<i>He took my sweet daughter.</i>

52:03.700 --> 52:07.199
<i>I don't really think
he was from the army.</i>

52:10.940 --> 52:13.099
<i>They're outside now.</i>

52:13.100 --> 52:15.619
<i>They're outside, Cameron.</i>

52:15.620 --> 52:20.559
<i>Christ, they're outside!
Crazy son of a bitch! Cameron!</i>

52:23.700 --> 52:25.381
Shane?

52:26.860 --> 52:28.399
Shane, are you there?

52:28.600 --> 52:30.279
<i>Get down!</i>

52:30.480 --> 52:32.419
<i>Cameron, no!</i>

52:32.420 --> 52:37.059
<i>Close the door! Get the door!</i>

52:37.060 --> 52:42.268
<i>Get down, now! No! No!
God! No, Cameron, no!</i>

53:46.540 --> 53:49.461
It won't be much longer now.

53:57.460 --> 53:59.585
Hey, Grand...

54:00.460 --> 54:02.300
Just...

54:03.820 --> 54:05.831
Just go.

54:08.900 --> 54:10.945
Just go.

55:24.300 --> 55:27.779
You keep trying to be the
savior, Doc, and all that guilt,

55:27.780 --> 55:30.382
it's gonna eat up your soul.

55:30.900 --> 55:34.339
You kept the man as
comfortable as you could.

55:34.340 --> 55:37.899
You better accept what's
gonna happen to us all.

55:37.900 --> 55:39.579
You keep swinging from
the rafters like that,

55:39.580 --> 55:43.901
you're liable to dirty up your
spirit for when you meet your Maker.

55:45.020 --> 55:47.588
I'll keep that in mind.

55:57.420 --> 56:01.359
Jonathan is insisting
that we bury Wendell.

56:05.020 --> 56:07.110
Absolutely not.

56:07.140 --> 56:10.479
The radiation is falling a little
bit, but it's still off the charts.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.150
That's what I'm talking about, Doc.

56:18.220 --> 56:21.630
That boy just wants to
do right by his kin.

56:22.100 --> 56:24.859
He's gonna join him soon enough.

56:24.860 --> 56:27.428
It'd be best if you
just let him do it.

56:36.620 --> 56:40.699
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

56:40.700 --> 56:43.059
I'm gonna take a little nap.

56:43.060 --> 56:46.869
Then I'm gonna help that
boy bury his granduncle.

57:39.940 --> 57:41.779
Hurry, guys, we gotta be quick.

57:41.780 --> 57:44.269
Let's go. Hurry.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.939
We should've just left him
up in the fucking attic!

57:47.940 --> 57:49.587
Brad!

57:50.420 --> 57:53.466
Quiet! They can hear us.

58:01.660 --> 58:03.466
You know what?

58:03.820 --> 58:06.299
Remember in the back?
There's, like, a water pump...

58:06.300 --> 58:09.779
No, no, the water's the most
contaminated thing around.

58:09.780 --> 58:11.419
It wouldn't be safe.

58:11.420 --> 58:14.341
Hey, Jonathan. I'm sorry.

58:15.140 --> 58:16.659
If you wanna say something...

58:16.660 --> 58:19.259
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, boy... Oh, boy, we gotta go!

58:19.260 --> 58:21.659
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, shit! Oh, God! You guys...

58:21.660 --> 58:23.280
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

58:23.900 --> 58:25.499
Watch out!

58:25.500 --> 58:26.619
Hey!

58:26.620 --> 58:27.699
Jonathan!

58:27.700 --> 58:29.979
Go! Everyone, back
in the house, now!

58:29.980 --> 58:31.786
Shit!

58:33.100 --> 58:34.339
Jonathan!

58:34.340 --> 58:37.019
- Fuck! I'm shot!
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

58:37.020 --> 58:39.299
- Get in the house now!
- Everybody, get inside!

58:39.300 --> 58:42.631
- Go! Go!
- Get inside now!

58:42.780 --> 58:45.223
- Move!
- Jonathan! Jonathan!

58:45.460 --> 58:47.979
- Jonathan!
- What...

58:47.980 --> 58:51.779

- We gotta finish burying him!

58:51.780 --> 58:54.139
Jesus Christ! Just run! Run!

58:54.140 --> 58:56.902
Close the door!

58:57.860 --> 59:00.462
Oh, damn! Rob!

59:02.980 --> 59:04.786
What happened?

59:26.660 --> 59:28.910
Go, go, go!

59:32.580 --> 59:35.419
Elizabeth, get me a clean rag.

59:35.420 --> 59:37.704
I don't think the
door's gonna hold.

59:37.860 --> 59:40.859
Let's just go up there
and fucking kill 'em all!

59:40.860 --> 59:42.819
No, they're just paper tigers.

59:42.820 --> 59:44.899

Shit!

59:49.740 --> 59:52.911
Oh, shit!

59:53.900 --> 59:57.699
Hey! Hey! Hey, what's the
matter? What's wrong?

59:57.700 --> 59:59.459
- What's wrong with her?
- She miscarried.

59:59.460 --> 01:00:03.739
What? No! Hey. Hey! Come on!

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:08.259
Snap out of it! Please!
God! Fucking help me!

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.704
- We gotta get her to a table.
- Get her to the fucking table!

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.699
- I got it. I got it!
- Grab her head.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.579
Jonathan, bring me a pillow.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.468
You're okay. She's okay, right?

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.859
Honey. Honey. Look...

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.579
- Everything's gonna be fine, right?
- I need to get in here.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.619
I need some towels or something.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.459
She's losing way too much blood.
I need to do a transfusion.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.819
- Help her, man!
- I don't have a way of doing a trans...

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.979
There's nothing I can do.
She needs a transfusion, Brad.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.779
There's nothing I can do!

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.299
What are you saying there's
nothing you can do? Come on, man.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.459
Fucking help her, man. Please!

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.699
Brad, no, you're not listening.
There's nothing I can do!

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.899
- No, no, no!
- She needs a transfusion!

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.459
- No... No. No!
- Jennifer!

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.299
There is something you can do!

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.819
- I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.
- Brad!

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.139
- All right. Stop.
- No, no stop! You fucking operate on my wife!

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.539
Get me... Get me...
Do you have a sewing kit?

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.819
- Yeah, my grandma's.
- Get me a sewing kit. I need a pot.

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.979
All right, I got this.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.379
- If you don't save her, I'll kill you!
- Get alcohol.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.219
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
- Okay.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.419
- Brad, you don't wanna do this, Brad.
- Yeah, I wanna do this!

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.909
I... I need my bag.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.979
- Come on!
- All right, I got this.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.859
Angie's gonna be fine!

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.306
- Brad! Brad, come here! Brad!
- Brad, get in here!

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.659
Brad!

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:31.707
Brad... There's no
future for our child.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.467
Look around. I don't want
him to see this world.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.939
Just make us proud, okay?

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.065
- Please don't do this to me.
- Okay?

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.146
Move!

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.065
Angie... Angie, Angie, Angie.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.186

looking pretty fucked up.

his body out of here?

I mean, there's just more and
more of those people out there.

No, we... We can't
take him outside.

No.

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.706

to carry him. I'm not gonna let you.

Okay, I owe you. I owe all of you.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.309
If someone's gonna risk
themselves, it should be me.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.019
Now, you always...

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.099
You've always kept us sensible.
This is the sensible thing.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.943
I mean, look at me. I'm not
gonna last much longer.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.270
It should be me.

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.419
How's your ear feeling?

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.181
I don't know.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.586
Can you, like, hear out
of it or anything?

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.979
I can't really feel them.

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.151
God, it's bleeding, dude.

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.861
Rob.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.425
All right.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.819
If there's anybody out there,

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:58.059
put the body down and get
back to the basement.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.821
Okay.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.862
Here. Take this.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.259
No.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.939
You need it down there more.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.224
I'll be all right.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.419
- Hey, Rob.
- What?

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.385
Good luck.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:18.586
You, too.

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.903
Rob's been out there a
long time, you guys.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:49.986
He hasn't come back. So...

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:55.549
What do you think? Think
those guys got to him?

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.625
Jonathan, I know you
and Rob were close.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.266
I'm sorry.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.744
You think they're in the house?

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.464
Jesus Christ!

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.379
Why do we still listen
to this shit? What...

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:27.659
What is this guy even
broadcasting about?

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.939
Why can't he just talk to us?

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.499
Maybe he's just always
accepted what's happened.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.699
Let's face it. We
never had a chance.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.622
- This all was over before we even got here.
- Great.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:44.422
So what are we even doing?

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.987
Why are we even still here?
Why don't we just give up?

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.541
I ain't killing myself.
Are you psychotic?

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.827
'Cause that's what we do.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:03.110
We try to survive.
So that we can go home.

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:06.102
Like Dorothy and Toto.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.945
Yeah, like Dorothy and Toto.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.502
Can't sleep either, huh?

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.541
I hear them, too.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.230
And they'll, uh...

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:16.229
They'll definitely be
coming down here soon.

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.419
Yep.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.069
God! Why do you think
they've waited so long?

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:28.187
So how's your shoulder?

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:32.105
The arm should probably come off.

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.188
Yeah, well...

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.461
You're doing a lot better than
the rest of us right now.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:46.759
So, you ready for this?

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.140
Yep.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.423
We should probably let them
sleep as long as they can.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.670
They're coming.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.339
Brad.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.939
I'm gonna go get everyone.

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:30.339
Elizabeth, wake up. Wake up. Get the
guns out. Give them to everybody.

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.941
Oh, shit!

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:36.943
- Jonathan, come on.
- Oh... Okay.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.461
Oh, shit!

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.308
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:56.981
God!

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.779
Are you all right?

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.826
What? Fuck you!

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.901
We are cornered down
here. We gotta go.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:18.949
- Okay.
- Let's go. Go.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.739
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.388
- What?
- It's my friend.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.190
I know him.

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.906
Do it.

01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.025
I'm sorry.

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.709
Get out of my grandparents' house!

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.749
Think we're about to die?

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.989
We're not dead yet.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.359
Argh!

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.710
Get up!

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.865
Let's go!

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.906
Shit!

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.710
Hey!

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:35.299
- Put her down.
- Oh, shit!

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.419
What happened?

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.546
- Get the door! Get the door!
- Aw, fuck!

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:48.547
Aw, shit!

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.979
- Her lung is collapsing.
- I can't hold it, man!

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.619
- Her chest cavity is filling up with air.
- Please, man! Hunter!

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.019
Shit! Fuck! God, please! Fuck!

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.619
Please...

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:02.666
Just let me go.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.664
I'm sorry.

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.744
- Fuck!
- Let me go.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.065
Let me...

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:20.239
- ...go.
- Elizabeth... Elizabeth.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.265
Elizabeth...

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.059
Argh!

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.867
Son of a bitch!

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:44.068
Fuck! You motherfucker!

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.746
Stupid fuck!

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.141
Jonathan...

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.786
We won.
