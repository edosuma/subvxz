WEBVTT

00:05.702 --> 00:09.170
<i>He was reaching for the food,</i>
<i>you mad cunt!</i>

00:09.238 --> 00:10.238
Attius stands with us.

00:10.306 --> 00:12.138
He stands a fucking Roman.

00:12.205 --> 00:14.224
Crassus denies me sharpened blade.

00:14.292 --> 00:15.810
<i>Under what purpose?</i>

00:15.877 --> 00:16.977
<i>Personal matter.</i>

00:17.045 --> 00:18.445
<i>Brigands of Cilicia.</i>

00:18.513 --> 00:19.446
Pirates?

00:19.514 --> 00:22.182
The Aedile and I had an arrangement.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.782
I will not beg for my life.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.216
Do this thing...

00:25.284 --> 00:26.384
<i>And you will be released.</i>

00:26.452 --> 00:27.412
Your man make fight gone.

00:27.453 --> 00:28.386
Ulpianus?

00:29.454 --> 00:30.621
Tell me where they are.

00:30.689 --> 00:33.758
I don't know who you speak of.

00:36.626 --> 00:38.026
<i>Tell your men to advance.</i>

00:38.094 --> 00:39.656
Your father gave strict order not...

00:39.724 --> 00:42.923
My father desires a wolf of battle.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.291
Advance!

00:49.791 --> 00:52.320
<i>Stand ground, stand your fucking ground!</i>

00:52.388 --> 00:53.352
<i>Retreat!</i>

00:54.600 --> 01:02.537

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:03.271 --> 01:05.071
<i>That should do it.</i>

01:05.138 --> 01:06.771
<i>Here then, you cunt!</i>

01:14.106 --> 01:15.471
There stands greater worry

01:15.536 --> 01:17.997
than grain carried to port
by Cilician shits.

01:18.065 --> 01:19.128
What would you have us feast upon?

01:19.196 --> 01:20.656
Promise of better days?

01:20.724 --> 01:24.248
I would see bellies filled
with the death of Romans.

01:24.316 --> 01:26.877
Crassus is certain
to dispatch more soldiers.

01:26.945 --> 01:28.844
And we should be preparing
to greet them.

01:28.912 --> 01:30.212
We are.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.180
By ensuring our own
do not go into battle

01:32.248 --> 01:33.481
weakened by hunger.

01:33.548 --> 01:35.915
<i>Full sails, we here for the night.</i>

01:35.983 --> 01:36.982
Heracleo.

01:37.050 --> 01:38.717
<i>How fares recent venture?</i>

01:38.784 --> 01:40.950
If you are of a thirst,
the gods have shown favor.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.317
You carry no grain?

01:42.385 --> 01:46.051
A clutch of amphoras so filled
were liberated from Roman ship.

01:46.119 --> 01:51.021
Yet its captain held more stock
in drink than seed of bread.

01:51.089 --> 01:53.257
Wine will not feed my people.

01:53.325 --> 01:56.226
The Romans have stored
most of their harvest

01:56.293 --> 01:58.494
against encroaching chill.

01:58.561 --> 02:00.996
Difficulty rises
in securing such bounty.

02:01.064 --> 02:02.597
As does its price?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.263
Yeah.

02:04.331 --> 02:07.325
Ah!

02:09.317 --> 02:11.518
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:11.586 --> 02:12.585
Move back!

02:12.653 --> 02:16.656
Whoa, hold and fall to reason!

02:16.723 --> 02:21.827
See each to a handful,
and clear them from the docks.

02:21.895 --> 02:23.262
Spartacus.

02:23.330 --> 02:25.464
<i>More slaves taken afoot approach gate.</i>

02:27.433 --> 02:29.534
Will you see them to a handful as well?

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.709 --> 02:40.909
Do you know of my sister?

02:40.977 --> 02:44.746
<i>I haven't laid eyes since the city fell.</i>

02:44.814 --> 02:46.114
We should not be wasting
what little food we have

02:46.182 --> 02:47.216
on fucking Romans.

02:47.283 --> 02:48.517
You know my mind upon subject.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.619
I stand with Crixus towards it.

02:50.687 --> 02:51.954
I have given Laeta my word.

02:52.022 --> 02:53.688
It will not be broken.

02:58.107 --> 03:00.370
Let me in, please!

03:06.465 --> 03:11.854
If you hold weapon you must
give over before entering city!

03:11.921 --> 03:13.086
Fuck!

03:13.154 --> 03:14.085
Weapon?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.815
Just this.

03:17.348 --> 03:19.011
<i>Merci.</i>

03:19.078 --> 03:21.308
It seems a lifetime past,
that I stood as him.

03:23.273 --> 03:24.271
<i>Show brand, and see what you...</i>

03:24.338 --> 03:26.435
Show brand or mark,

03:26.500 --> 03:29.331
to prove you stand former slave
and no friend of the Republic!

03:29.399 --> 03:31.028
<i>We have nowhere to go!</i>

03:31.096 --> 03:32.625
<i>Show me your brand.</i>
Show brand.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.253
The most fearsome weapons yet exposed.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.847
I would take no offense
to closer inspection...

03:41.915 --> 03:46.376
<i>Next.</i>

03:53.701 --> 03:57.197
<i>Show me your brand, show me your brand.</i>

03:57.265 --> 03:58.494
<i>We need a place to sleep!</i>

03:58.562 --> 03:59.492
<i>Open bag!</i>

03:59.560 --> 04:01.292
Put mind at ease, brother.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.222
You'll have no need of this here.

04:03.290 --> 04:05.952
Spartacus does not favor
his people holding coin.

04:06.019 --> 04:07.117
<i>Spartacus!</i>

04:12.316 --> 04:14.185
This one carries knowledge
of Crassus' army.

04:14.253 --> 04:16.351
I say about a half
day's march from our wharves.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.515
How great a force?

04:17.583 --> 04:20.014
Larger than fucking city by her word.

04:20.081 --> 04:22.178
<i>Yet he has made camp and holds advance.</i>

04:22.246 --> 04:24.708
Why stay hand when
it grips such numbers?

04:24.776 --> 04:25.974
<i>He but grips his own fucking cock</i>

04:26.041 --> 04:27.139
if he believes we will...

04:27.207 --> 04:28.536
<i>Run!</i>
<i>Fucking Romans!</i>

04:28.604 --> 04:29.602
<i>The Romans!</i>

04:31.035 --> 04:34.796
Seal the gate!

04:39.027 --> 04:42.589
Give fucking way!

05:03.983 --> 05:09.178
<i>Fucking shits drew upon</i>
<i>us when pressed to show brand.</i>

05:09.246 --> 05:12.010
Gratitude for assistance.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.141
There is no greater glory...

05:14.209 --> 05:15.642
Than the death of your enemy.

05:24.451 --> 05:29.547
<i>I would lay eyes upon your brand friend.</i>

05:29.615 --> 05:31.646
Well, that presents some difficulties.

05:31.713 --> 05:33.910
More so if you are absent one.

05:39.074 --> 05:40.572
My dominus branded all his slaves

05:40.640 --> 05:43.971
close to cock and cunt,

05:44.038 --> 05:48.364
equally enjoyed upon drunken nights.

05:48.429 --> 05:53.158
With that knife I rid myself
of him and his fucking mark...

05:59.451 --> 06:01.615
<i>Fall to cover and join the others.</i>

06:06.686 --> 06:09.888
Sever their heads and set them
to pike upon wall,

06:09.956 --> 06:13.583
as warning against future attempt.

06:13.651 --> 06:16.511
Crixus, Gannicus, Agron...

06:16.578 --> 06:18.808
I would have much needed words.

06:34.225 --> 06:36.920
<i>It seizes heart,</i>
<i>to know you in such pain.</i>

06:36.988 --> 06:39.516
A deeper wound stands
removed from sight.

06:39.584 --> 06:42.545
He has not come to your side?

06:42.613 --> 06:44.643
I recall my father's grim visage

06:44.711 --> 06:48.872
when first you delivered
me to encampment.

06:48.939 --> 06:51.170
I have not since laid eyes upon it.

06:51.237 --> 06:52.477
<i>Place no worries in the absence.</i>

06:52.501 --> 06:53.369
The Imperator's mind

06:53.437 --> 06:54.373
is taken with thoughts

06:54.441 --> 06:55.376
of coming battle

06:55.444 --> 06:57.013
against Spartacus.

06:57.081 --> 06:58.983
We move to reclaim the city?

06:59.051 --> 07:01.953
I have received no order
to break encampment.

07:02.020 --> 07:04.489
Though a large number of men
have been dispatched north.

07:04.556 --> 07:05.957
North?

07:06.024 --> 07:06.958
Towards what purpose?

07:08.427 --> 07:10.662
I do not hold your father's
confidence in such matters.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.833
We stand as one in such regard.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.970
What of Caesar?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.340
Does he circle fading corpse,

07:20.408 --> 07:24.911
eager to strip flesh of title
as word and will of my father?

07:24.979 --> 07:26.946
He no longer stands among us.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.214
Caesar has fallen?

07:28.282 --> 07:29.816
<i>He but follows command.</i>

07:31.752 --> 07:32.819
Leave us.

07:39.260 --> 07:40.961
You have given Caesar mission?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.529
<i>One always intended.</i>

07:42.597 --> 07:44.631
He secrets himself among the rebels,

07:44.699 --> 07:47.868
to hasten their fall.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.737
The reason you ordered
he remain unshorn.

07:50.805 --> 07:53.106
<i>To assume guise of errant slave.</i>

07:53.174 --> 07:59.079
One must appear as wolf
to be welcomed by the pack.

07:59.147 --> 08:02.283
A plan well considered.

08:02.351 --> 08:06.154
I will stand by your side
when it bears deadly fruit.

08:06.222 --> 08:09.891
That day has not yet arrived.

08:11.027 --> 08:13.928
Rest, allow wound to properly heal.

08:13.996 --> 08:16.964
Uh, I am your word
and your will, Father.

08:17.032 --> 08:19.800
A position not commanded from upon back.

08:23.004 --> 08:25.272
See yourself to uniform.

08:25.340 --> 08:27.875
<i>And let us break words</i>
<i>towards your men's punishment,</i>

08:27.943 --> 08:30.711
for foolish attempt against Spartacus.

08:35.484 --> 08:38.552
Mystery of Crassus holding
advance falls to discovery.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.020
The fucking cock on him.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.121
Believing a few men could end rebellion.

08:42.190 --> 08:45.925
Crassus does not move
as the others we have faced.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.326
<i>He adopts our strategies,</i>

08:47.394 --> 08:49.595
in effort to twist them against us.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.264
We should heed caution,

08:51.332 --> 08:52.699
and see the gates remain closed.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.000
I will not deny entry

08:54.068 --> 08:56.002
to those who have risked life to
break from their masters.

08:56.070 --> 08:58.071
<i>A thing born late in any regard.</i>

08:58.139 --> 08:59.206
Many unknown to us

08:59.273 --> 09:00.374
have already passed through gate

09:00.441 --> 09:02.543
to join cause, if outward form

09:02.611 --> 09:04.178
<i>does not conceal darker intent.</i>

09:04.246 --> 09:05.980
If there stand such among our ranks,

09:06.047 --> 09:07.614
we must see them exposed.

09:07.682 --> 09:09.116
You scale a mountain of ifs.

09:09.184 --> 09:11.718
I would add to its peak.

09:11.786 --> 09:15.755
<i>If you are struck down</i>
<i>by one of your errant flock,</i>

09:15.823 --> 09:20.360
how would they fare absent guidance?

09:20.428 --> 09:23.597
<i>Crixus would see them upon proper path.</i>

09:23.665 --> 09:25.332
With aid of wise council,

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
<i>gathered at this table.</i>

09:26.468 --> 09:28.269
I pray to the gods

09:28.337 --> 09:32.740
that is a day I never
see come to pass, brother.

09:32.808 --> 09:34.609
<i>Yet if I held sole command,</i>

09:34.677 --> 09:37.078
I would move swiftly against Crassus.

09:37.146 --> 09:38.780
On this we share thought.

09:38.848 --> 09:41.349
We are men of blood and battle.

09:41.417 --> 09:44.386
And the streets grow
restless with idle purpose.

09:44.454 --> 09:48.293
We must stay course agreed upon.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.628
We hold advantage of city walls;

09:50.696 --> 09:53.865
<i>Crassus' legions</i>
<i>will suffer on open plains,</i>

09:53.933 --> 09:56.467
while we train swelling numbers

09:56.535 --> 09:59.437
to see weakened foe to the afterlife.

09:59.504 --> 10:01.572
Would that Attius was still alive,

10:01.640 --> 10:03.807
to forge more weapons.

10:03.875 --> 10:05.642
You would see traitor live,

10:05.710 --> 10:08.578
and Naevia with brains
upon fucking sand?

10:08.646 --> 10:10.914
Let Attius stand as promised fate

10:10.982 --> 10:13.984
for all who would see Roman
slaves from shackle.

10:14.052 --> 10:16.956
Fix mind upon the present,

10:17.023 --> 10:18.824
gauge prowess of those newly among us.

10:18.892 --> 10:20.359
Escaped Romans yet to be found,

10:20.427 --> 10:21.861
Crassus upon our gate,

10:21.929 --> 10:23.663
and you would have
me play fucking doctore?

10:23.730 --> 10:28.480
I would have you observe
with watchful eye.

10:28.537 --> 10:31.237
Any that measure beyond expectation

10:31.305 --> 10:34.198
may reveal themselves
more than they appear.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.573
<i>Join brother, and see it done.</i>

10:48.331 --> 10:50.206
A lifetime ago the words "fucking Gauls"

10:50.274 --> 10:52.784
would spring from mouth.

10:52.851 --> 10:53.872
If it did fall to Crixus to...

10:53.940 --> 10:56.169
You are yet among the living,

10:56.237 --> 10:58.966
and I would see it remain so.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.789
Until threat is known,

11:00.856 --> 11:04.641
I will be as fucking shadow.

11:06.218 --> 11:07.339
Then darken heel,

11:07.407 --> 11:10.436
and let us move to better
know mind of our enemy.

11:13.736 --> 11:15.077
If I stood Roman,

11:15.144 --> 11:17.587
my sword would have your
life in favor of ass.

11:17.655 --> 11:18.575
Again!

11:30.933 --> 11:32.441
If that man proves assassin,

11:32.509 --> 11:34.384
then I am Jupiter's fucking cock.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.039
Hmm.

11:36.107 --> 11:38.116
No skill.

11:38.171 --> 11:40.419
Small cock.

11:41.218 --> 11:42.138
You.

11:43.394 --> 11:44.582
Step forward.

11:53.410 --> 11:56.827
I have witnessed your skill with
knife upon the unsuspecting.

11:56.895 --> 11:58.283
<i>Let us see how you fare with sword</i>

11:58.350 --> 12:00.159
against more discerning eye.

12:18.411 --> 12:20.486
We waste fucking effort.

12:20.554 --> 12:21.875
If there is a Roman among them,

12:21.943 --> 12:23.184
would they not feign ignorance

12:23.252 --> 12:24.939
of the ways of fighting men?

12:25.007 --> 12:27.170
An animal cannot hide truer nature.

12:27.237 --> 12:28.325
<i>When pressed to corner,</i>

12:28.392 --> 12:31.689
<i>it will expose teeth and snap jaw.</i>

12:38.955 --> 12:42.386
You are no stranger
to the clash of steel.

12:42.454 --> 12:44.830
All shepherds are versed in sound.

12:44.885 --> 12:46.773
Many seek to claim
another master's stock

12:46.828 --> 12:51.313
upon hill and plain.

12:57.821 --> 13:01.552
<i>And what did your dominus</i>
<i>call his defender of goat,</i>

13:01.619 --> 13:03.395
before he slipped from grasp?

13:03.462 --> 13:04.937
Lyciscus.

13:05.005 --> 13:07.515
A name forced upon me.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.458
One I desire quickly shed.

13:32.272 --> 13:36.257
I shall have rematch, upon a day.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.122
You.

13:47.190 --> 13:51.795
Step forward, and attempt
to remain from fucking ground.

13:59.968 --> 14:01.543
They take interest in you.

14:10.539 --> 14:13.315
Do they take it in you as well?

14:13.382 --> 14:15.159
And with coin I saw you relieving those

14:15.226 --> 14:18.190
seeking refuge within your walls?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.587
Break such words again,

14:21.236 --> 14:22.636
and I shall relieve you of something

14:22.692 --> 14:23.712
far more valuable.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.698
Ah, you mistake intent, brother.

14:25.765 --> 14:29.372
I mention deed only
towards thoughts of my own.

14:29.439 --> 14:33.552
<i>A city such as this holds</i>
<i>great opportunity,</i>

14:33.620 --> 14:37.957
for those brave enough to seize it.

14:43.831 --> 14:44.964
<i>She turns from offer of villa</i>

14:45.032 --> 14:46.732
<i>for straw and the smell of shit?</i>

14:46.800 --> 14:49.268
<i>For reason fallen upon</i>
<i>understanding ear.</i>

14:49.336 --> 14:50.770
The mind of a woman.

14:50.838 --> 14:52.004
A foreign thing.

14:52.072 --> 14:56.709
I would have words alone,
and see it deciphered.

14:56.777 --> 14:58.544
She holds no threat.

14:58.612 --> 15:00.680
I shall place myself at entrance.

15:00.747 --> 15:04.884
With sword clutched in fucking hand.

15:04.952 --> 15:07.053
Did not think the Slayer
of the Shadow of Death

15:07.121 --> 15:09.923
had need of protector.

15:09.991 --> 15:14.061
Unfortunate precaution,
in wake of morning's events.

15:14.129 --> 15:15.596
Word carries of the attack.

15:15.663 --> 15:17.764
Does it also carry word
of Marcus Crassus,

15:17.832 --> 15:20.134
the man who commanded it?

15:20.202 --> 15:22.269
Crassus...

15:22.337 --> 15:23.470
You are pleased with the man

15:23.538 --> 15:27.207
Rome has sent to kill me.

15:27.275 --> 15:31.278
Crassus stands as no other
in certainty of intent.

15:31.345 --> 15:33.814
<i>He will not stop short of your end.</i>

15:33.881 --> 15:35.148
He is not the first Roman

15:35.216 --> 15:37.150
to believe himself capable of the act.

15:37.217 --> 15:39.084
Those that came before
him did not hold wealth

15:39.152 --> 15:41.086
to turn Juno Moneta envious.

15:41.154 --> 15:44.190
Coin holds little worth
upon the field of battle.

15:44.258 --> 15:46.559
What of a mind keen enough to amass it?

15:53.234 --> 15:57.537
Upon our first meeting you spoke
of dealings with Crassus.

15:57.605 --> 15:59.573
<i>I would know of anything</i>
<i>ear may have caught.</i>

15:59.640 --> 16:01.810
<i>Such knowledge will not reverse sun,</i>

16:01.878 --> 16:04.012
nor alter the course of river's fate.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.850
Then there stands
no reason to deny request.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.052
Our business with Crassus

16:10.119 --> 16:15.324
concerned only grain
and shipment, nothing more.

16:15.392 --> 16:20.329
Yet my husband imparted story,

16:20.397 --> 16:23.833
shared by Aedile of Neapolis
towards future dealings.

16:23.901 --> 16:28.204
The man was thick
in negotiations with Crassus

16:28.271 --> 16:31.340
when he intercepted message
from reviled competitor,

16:31.408 --> 16:34.312
offering more favorable
terms to Crassus.

16:34.379 --> 16:35.513
While seeing both profit

16:35.581 --> 16:39.356
and valuable client soon to vanish,

16:39.423 --> 16:42.626
the Aedile burned errant message,

16:42.694 --> 16:45.029
swiftly agreed to Crassus' demands.

16:45.097 --> 16:47.832
Only to discover months later

16:47.900 --> 16:50.502
<i>Crassus himself had sent the message,</i>

16:50.570 --> 16:53.605
intending for the Aedile
to lay hands upon it,

16:53.673 --> 16:57.582
and move in direction desired.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.253
I too intercepted message from Crassus.

17:04.791 --> 17:08.361
And used what was gleaned

17:08.429 --> 17:11.231
to clear path for him to assume command.

17:11.298 --> 17:15.234
You have struck fear into
the very heart of the Republic.

17:15.303 --> 17:18.868
<i>Imagine the glory that awaits...</i>

17:18.935 --> 17:22.038
the man who defeats you.

17:22.106 --> 17:24.374
Heracleo delivers less than expected.

17:24.441 --> 17:25.909
Rations must be lowered by another half.

17:25.976 --> 17:28.144
We will make due.

17:28.211 --> 17:32.013
Until Crassus reclaims the city.

17:32.081 --> 17:37.952
He does not stand the only
one capable of the unexpected.

17:38.019 --> 17:39.220
Let us seek Heracleo,

17:39.288 --> 17:43.925
and a future even the mighty
Crassus will not see coming.

17:50.868 --> 17:53.804
<i>Dispatch another thousand</i>
<i>men to aid Quinctius.</i>

17:53.872 --> 17:55.639
We must see progress hastened.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.840
Imperator.

18:02.680 --> 18:07.683
My word and my will.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.784
You understand what that means?

18:10.852 --> 18:14.521
Yes, Father.

18:14.589 --> 18:15.656
Do you?

18:27.168 --> 18:32.841
The first battle in my campaign
forever etched in history.

18:32.909 --> 18:35.143
As a victory for Spartacus.

18:35.211 --> 18:37.978
Father...
He was not to be engaged

18:38.046 --> 18:40.648
until I arrived with proper force.

18:40.716 --> 18:45.819
Was command not fucking clear?!

18:45.887 --> 18:48.355
It was.

18:48.423 --> 18:50.391
Yet opportunity presented

18:50.458 --> 18:54.661
when Spartacus moved beyond city walls.

18:54.729 --> 18:58.031
I thought it greater
offense not to seize moment.

19:03.137 --> 19:06.773
Apologies for disobeying
your command, Father.

19:06.841 --> 19:11.177
A thing that could
be forgiven in light of youth.

19:11.245 --> 19:13.079
Yet your men falling to retreat

19:13.147 --> 19:15.515
does not so easily slip from concern.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.284
I ordered them to stand ground.

19:17.351 --> 19:19.653
Yet they fled.

19:19.720 --> 19:25.259
Because they feared the enemy
more than their commanders.

19:25.326 --> 19:29.763
A false assumption
we must see corrected.

19:32.634 --> 19:38.340
What punishment would
you have me inflict?

19:38.408 --> 19:41.043
One to stand warning.

19:41.111 --> 19:43.445
That death at the hands of Spartacus

19:43.513 --> 19:46.815
pales against the wrath
of the House of Crassus.

19:50.453 --> 19:51.953
<i>Decimation?</i>

19:52.021 --> 19:53.193
Not since the days of Marius

19:53.246 --> 19:55.413
has savage ritual been so commanded.

19:56.142 --> 19:58.611
He would make example.

19:58.679 --> 20:00.413
Of what befalls a man who turns heel

20:00.480 --> 20:01.514
in face of enemy.

20:01.582 --> 20:04.484
The fault is mine.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.386
Had I obeyed your order
to stand ground...

20:06.454 --> 20:08.355
Our men broke rank and fled.

20:08.423 --> 20:11.458
You were left absent choice.

20:11.526 --> 20:15.128
As my father now leaves me.

20:15.196 --> 20:17.164
<i>Fifty men.</i>

20:17.231 --> 20:20.267
Fifty stones.

20:20.334 --> 20:25.639
Five stained with the promise of death.

20:25.707 --> 20:29.576
Draw well and live.

20:29.644 --> 20:31.044
Draw poorly...

20:39.154 --> 20:41.856
You stayed at my side
while the others ran.

20:41.924 --> 20:44.292
I am yet from this world because of you.

20:44.359 --> 20:48.395
Place it from mind.

20:48.463 --> 20:52.199
And pray I draw well.

20:52.267 --> 20:57.004
You do not deserve to be placed
at risk among cowards.

20:57.072 --> 20:58.206
I will talk to my father

20:58.273 --> 21:00.808
and beg your removal from decimation.

21:00.876 --> 21:05.213
The act would only
diminish you in his eyes.

21:05.281 --> 21:08.483
A thing I would never allow.

21:08.551 --> 21:13.322
You stand most honorable in his legions.

21:13.389 --> 21:15.424
And this is fucking reward!

21:21.034 --> 21:23.736
I shall do as commanded.

21:23.803 --> 21:28.140
As all soldiers must.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.395
The stables were a sweeter smell.

21:55.167 --> 21:56.368
<i>Castus.</i>

21:56.435 --> 21:58.270
Where is Heracleo?

21:58.338 --> 22:01.273
He was heavy with drink
and whores last I laid eyes.

22:01.341 --> 22:02.908
<i>Seek him upon deck of his ship.</i>

22:02.975 --> 22:04.710
The man has a well known preference

22:04.779 --> 22:07.715
for sea and cunt,
spread equally before him.

22:09.018 --> 22:10.152
Gratitude.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.523
Come, share cup, and we shall
seek him together.

22:13.590 --> 22:16.759
We would not wallow in such low company.

22:18.195 --> 22:20.663
<i>Ah...</i>

22:20.731 --> 22:22.732
We are moved by pressing business.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.799
Another time.

22:23.867 --> 22:26.536
Hmm.

22:26.603 --> 22:27.903
Oh!

22:32.242 --> 22:34.276
<i>You wish to fuck the man,</i>

22:34.344 --> 22:36.312
make introduction and present cock.

22:36.380 --> 22:40.116
I would sooner caress
shit and call it lover.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.119
<i>Cilicians cannot be trusted.</i>

22:42.186 --> 22:45.856
You are familiar with their kind?

22:45.924 --> 22:48.359
I have had the displeasure
of their company,

22:48.426 --> 22:50.094
in years past.

22:50.162 --> 22:52.230
Choose words with care.

22:52.297 --> 22:53.331
Walk with taste.

22:53.399 --> 22:55.933
Spartacus calls them fucking ally.

23:00.569 --> 23:02.870
You do not share opinion?

23:03.939 --> 23:06.673
It would hold no fucking matter.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.441
I am but humble servant

23:08.508 --> 23:11.243
to the will of our glorious leader.

23:11.310 --> 23:16.514
I have heard rumor Spartacus
stands a god among his people.

23:18.817 --> 23:23.621
I have imperiled life
for his cause many times.

23:23.688 --> 23:27.657
At Vesuvius and Calor

23:27.725 --> 23:30.093
and battles far too numerous
in the counting.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.795
Even in the taking of this fucking city.

23:32.863 --> 23:35.230
Only to witness remainder of enemy

23:35.298 --> 23:36.898
spared within its walls.

23:36.966 --> 23:39.067
And coin honestly gained

23:39.135 --> 23:40.869
stripped from hand to forge bargain

23:40.936 --> 23:44.272
with the fucking Cilicians.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.908
But small wonder
you are forced to relieve

23:46.976 --> 23:49.010
what you can from those
newly entering gate.

23:49.078 --> 23:51.246
A fraction of what is owed to me.

23:58.452 --> 24:00.587
That is all I carry.

24:00.654 --> 24:04.189
Consider it yours, toward
our continued friendship.

24:09.460 --> 24:15.264
Too small a sum, to purchase
so rare an item.

24:15.332 --> 24:20.002
Perhaps together we can see it grow.

24:20.070 --> 24:22.205
And both our fortunes rise.

24:37.819 --> 24:39.587
<i>Apologies.</i>

24:41.289 --> 24:45.192
I will not have you speak of this.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.827
Yes, Domina.

24:46.895 --> 24:48.696
I no longer stand as such.

24:48.763 --> 24:51.866
You may call me Laeta.

24:51.934 --> 24:55.069
I often dreamed of being of your house.

24:55.136 --> 24:57.972
You were one of Laurus', were you not?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.140
Many nights I laid prayers

24:59.207 --> 25:00.808
to be free of him.

25:00.876 --> 25:01.836
If only city did not need

25:01.877 --> 25:03.110
to fall in their answering.

25:05.379 --> 25:08.248
Embrace what you have.

25:08.316 --> 25:10.450
All can change in sudden moment.

25:15.389 --> 25:16.690
There, you fucking cunt!

25:16.758 --> 25:18.625
Brictius!

25:18.693 --> 25:21.128
Spartacus gave clear orders.

25:21.195 --> 25:22.763
No hands are to be laid
upon these people.

25:22.830 --> 25:25.165
This Roman shit laid hands upon me,

25:25.233 --> 25:26.400
snapping at robe as I passed.

25:26.468 --> 25:28.602
I but entreated for word of my sister...

25:28.670 --> 25:29.704
Fuck your sister!

25:32.841 --> 25:36.610
Unleash cock, and find it severed.

25:36.677 --> 25:40.747
All their fucking heads
should be set upon pike.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.083
Gratitude.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.152
Owed to Spartacus.

25:46.220 --> 25:48.421
I tend to agree about the pikes.

25:48.489 --> 25:49.422
Wait!

25:49.490 --> 25:50.490
My sister...

25:50.558 --> 25:51.725
Fabia...

25:51.792 --> 25:53.293
flaxen of hair, such as your woman.

25:53.361 --> 25:56.196
I beg of you, I must know if she lives.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.031
Many Roman dead.

25:58.099 --> 26:03.035
You join sister perhaps,
touch again one of us.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.236
<i>Please.</i>

26:06.573 --> 26:10.943
I have not seen her.

26:15.815 --> 26:16.748
Hmm?

26:17.817 --> 26:20.052
Why Spartacus allow them live?

26:20.119 --> 26:21.753
I hold no understanding towards it,

26:21.821 --> 26:23.488
<i>yet we shall honor desire.</i>

26:26.926 --> 26:28.660
Gannicus, I must have words.

26:28.728 --> 26:31.630
None give little girl,
not drink and fuck.

26:31.698 --> 26:33.265
She makes valid argument.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.768
You must listen.

26:35.836 --> 26:38.270
I have laid eyes upon
something that lends worry.

28:05.597 --> 28:09.834
We have taken to each
other's arms many times.

28:09.902 --> 28:13.072
Yet never have soared so high.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.841
We are far from Rome.

28:15.909 --> 28:21.613
And tethers that prevent such flight.

28:21.681 --> 28:23.582
Gratitude.

28:23.650 --> 28:25.951
For allowing me to stay by your side.

28:26.019 --> 28:27.853
Mmm...

28:29.290 --> 28:32.526
I would never have you leave it.

28:32.594 --> 28:35.963
Your presence gives much needed comfort.

28:38.766 --> 28:41.001
It must weigh mind.

28:41.069 --> 28:44.872
This war with Spartacus.

28:44.940 --> 28:49.310
He is but nuisance,
soon to fade from memory.

28:51.246 --> 28:55.683
My thoughts churn upon closer relation.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.228
You have said Tiberius'
wounds already mend.

29:06.296 --> 29:08.731
He will stand your word
and will in coming days.

29:08.799 --> 29:11.701
Mmm.

29:11.769 --> 29:16.472
A weight I question placing
again on so green a sapling.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.674
He grows stronger each day

29:18.742 --> 29:22.512
beneath warming
sun of father's guidance.

29:22.579 --> 29:24.747
Ah, Tiberius has given all to please me.

29:24.815 --> 29:29.185
To become honored soldier.

29:29.253 --> 29:31.187
Yet when eyes are greeted,

29:31.255 --> 29:33.557
<i>there stands only a child before me.</i>

29:33.624 --> 29:36.660
Playing at the games of men.

29:36.727 --> 29:39.997
<i>He has fought and bled</i>
<i>for the glory of Rome.</i>

29:40.064 --> 29:42.099
For his Imperator.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.067
Does he not deserve to be treated

29:44.135 --> 29:46.437
as any other beneath your command?

29:55.747 --> 29:58.483
You know I stand sympathetic
toward your plight.

29:58.550 --> 30:01.186
Our numbers have unexpectedly swelled.

30:01.253 --> 30:03.088
My men and I can only provide

30:03.155 --> 30:05.257
what we ourselves can lay hand upon.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.359
It is not enough.

30:07.427 --> 30:09.128
Perhaps it would be,

30:09.196 --> 30:13.800
<i>if resources were not drained</i>
<i>by undeserving mouths...</i>

30:15.003 --> 30:16.336
<i>You stray from subject.</i>

30:16.404 --> 30:17.604
<i>As you from reason.</i>

30:17.672 --> 30:19.372
<i>Do you think they would</i>
<i>treat your people</i>

30:19.440 --> 30:20.974
with such kindness?

30:21.042 --> 30:22.576
We are not Romans.

30:22.644 --> 30:27.613
Nor shall we become them
by acts of unnecessary cruelty.

30:30.450 --> 30:32.651
<i>This fucking man!</i>

30:35.688 --> 30:40.526
I will provide you with what
I can to feed the lofty ideals.

30:42.028 --> 30:45.831
Yet fear, it shall
fall short of desired mark.

30:45.898 --> 30:48.233
I would see target adjusted,

30:48.301 --> 30:53.438
<i>and center struck with surer purpose.</i>

30:53.506 --> 30:56.641
You wish to alter terms
of our agreement?

30:56.709 --> 31:00.940
I would but add to it,

31:01.008 --> 31:05.778
and see your ships filled
with more promising cargo.

31:14.053 --> 31:15.153
<i>Nemetes!</i>

31:15.221 --> 31:17.088
I would have words.

31:17.156 --> 31:19.157
And I would finish fucking drink.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.626
Fucking Gauls.

31:22.694 --> 31:24.428
Shitholes rivaling the Thracians...

31:24.495 --> 31:26.296
I am not fucking cur!

31:26.364 --> 31:28.331
<i>Gauls.</i>

31:28.399 --> 31:32.667
Return to drink and whores,
or part from this world.

31:32.735 --> 31:35.169
Choose.

31:40.241 --> 31:43.110
<i>You did not need to be so rough</i>
<i>in demonstration.</i>

31:43.178 --> 31:46.880
We both must play our part.

31:46.948 --> 31:50.451
Now speak about what
have you discovered?

31:50.518 --> 31:53.253
The man holds no love for Rome,

31:53.321 --> 31:55.922
through weight of his words.

31:55.990 --> 31:57.490
How do you balance them against truth?

31:57.558 --> 32:00.827
I believe his loyalties mirror my own.

32:00.894 --> 32:03.028
Yet I will set final test,

32:03.096 --> 32:05.863
and gauge action against words.

32:05.931 --> 32:10.466
If words prove false, so does the man.

32:11.935 --> 32:16.271
See it done.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.121
A common thing,

32:32.189 --> 32:34.990
to be so rudely handled by a brother?

32:35.058 --> 32:39.361
Ah, he stands no brother to me.

32:39.429 --> 32:42.231
Nor any man that
has not earned my trust.

32:42.299 --> 32:43.232
Oh.

32:43.299 --> 32:46.001
I fear mood has taken sour turn.

32:46.068 --> 32:47.235
Come.

32:47.303 --> 32:48.470
Let us sweeten it with drink.

32:48.537 --> 32:52.407
I would set desire
towards greater spoils.

32:52.475 --> 32:56.945
And in the revealing of them,
set true nature to light...

33:06.581 --> 33:09.316
<i>This precious jewel</i>

33:09.383 --> 33:14.119
once stood domina to many
slaves within the city.

33:14.187 --> 33:18.757
They attended her every need.

33:18.824 --> 33:24.095
As she now attends ours...

33:24.163 --> 33:25.963
Spartacus allows this?

33:27.599 --> 33:30.067
Fuck the gods, no.

33:30.135 --> 33:33.437
<i>He helped himself to my fucking coin.</i>

33:33.504 --> 33:38.374
I returned favor...

33:41.177 --> 33:43.511
with one of his little pets.

33:59.325 --> 34:02.494
<i>Prove yourself no friend</i>
<i>to these people.</i>

34:02.561 --> 34:06.196
Use this Roman for untold pleasures.

34:06.264 --> 34:11.667
And when you have finished,
leave fresh mark upon her.

34:12.869 --> 34:14.636
As we have so often done.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.342
Leave us.

34:33.356 --> 34:35.623
Calm yourself, calm yourself.

34:35.690 --> 34:37.425
I stand a Roman, as you.

34:44.466 --> 34:47.333
My name is Gaius Julius Caesar.

34:47.402 --> 34:52.005
I come in the name of Marcus Crassus.

34:52.072 --> 34:54.507
His legions are gathering in the north.

34:54.574 --> 34:56.476
We shall take this city,

34:56.543 --> 35:00.050
and see all those who have
done this to you suffer.

35:00.118 --> 35:02.219
Free me...

35:02.287 --> 35:04.355
Soon Crassus will come.

35:04.422 --> 35:06.457
You have my word.

35:19.870 --> 35:21.437
Free me...

35:44.695 --> 35:49.065
What is your name?

35:49.133 --> 35:50.967
Fabia.

35:51.034 --> 35:52.134
Fabia.

36:01.079 --> 36:06.350
Know that it shall not be forgotten.

36:06.418 --> 36:09.320
Nor the men that set you upon this fate.

36:33.648 --> 36:35.749
What have you done, you mad fuck?!

36:35.816 --> 36:37.817
I set her free.

36:37.885 --> 36:40.720
As I would all Romans
yet held by Spartacus.

36:49.131 --> 36:51.967
You truly do stand one of us.

36:52.034 --> 36:53.768
<i>Come, brother.</i>

36:53.836 --> 36:55.970
Let us see it done.

37:02.381 --> 37:06.321
There stands no stronger
bond between men,

37:06.388 --> 37:09.590
than one forged in war.

37:09.658 --> 37:12.193
Nor greater glory

37:12.261 --> 37:17.365
than to fall in defense of mother Rome.

37:17.433 --> 37:19.801
Each of you swore sacramentum.

37:21.037 --> 37:23.638
To obey order given.

37:23.706 --> 37:27.743
To refrain from theft
or breach of common law.

37:27.810 --> 37:31.146
To protect the Legionary Standard.

37:31.214 --> 37:36.852
And never to break rank
nor flee from enemy.

37:40.023 --> 37:45.961
<i>Those who stand before</i>
<i>me turned from field of battle.</i>

37:47.130 --> 37:52.568
Retreated from the rebel Spartacus

37:52.636 --> 37:55.438
and his army of slaves,

37:55.505 --> 38:00.276
fearing them more than
their own commander.

38:00.344 --> 38:07.150
An error this night
I shall see corrected.

38:08.486 --> 38:14.958
And in the lesson,
lay fear upon proper name.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.962
Marcus.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.932
Licinius.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.335
Crassus.

38:33.679 --> 38:37.215
<i>Those who survive decimation</i>

38:37.283 --> 38:40.252
shall be banished to the followers camp.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.188
<i>To live among slaves and whores</i>

38:43.255 --> 38:49.328
<i>until such a day I deem</i>
<i>you worthy of proper company.</i>

38:52.132 --> 38:53.765
Father, I would have word...

38:53.833 --> 38:55.067
I am not your father in this.

38:55.134 --> 38:59.705
I am your fucking Imperator.

38:59.773 --> 39:03.075
I have too long considered
you a child, Tiberius.

39:03.143 --> 39:05.377
Apologies.

39:05.445 --> 39:07.279
You stand a soldier now,

39:07.347 --> 39:11.250
and deserve to be treated as any other.

39:11.317 --> 39:12.618
Join your men.

39:16.423 --> 39:17.924
Fall to command.

39:36.411 --> 39:39.279
<i>Draw lots.</i>

39:39.347 --> 39:44.251
<i>Let this night be forever remembered.</i>

39:44.319 --> 39:46.853
<i>And cause never repeated.</i>

40:11.846 --> 40:13.480
Present your fates.

40:20.554 --> 40:23.822
No, no, fuck!

40:27.060 --> 40:28.460
You cannot do that!

40:48.148 --> 40:49.682
Apologies there is so little.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.984
Food grows scarce.

40:52.052 --> 40:53.819
You risk life for us.

40:53.887 --> 40:55.248
There is no more we can ask of you.

40:55.255 --> 40:57.490
See heart lifted with welcomed news.

40:57.558 --> 40:59.318
Crassus and his legions
are but a day's march

40:59.360 --> 41:00.327
from our city.

41:00.394 --> 41:01.661
He will retake it,

41:01.729 --> 41:03.997
<i>and in the act end our suffering...</i>

41:04.065 --> 41:05.799
<i>I fear it has just begun.</i>

41:10.137 --> 41:11.137
Apologies, Laeta.

41:11.205 --> 41:13.204
I had to tell them what I saw.

41:13.272 --> 41:15.440
The fault is my own.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.675
For laying trust in a rebellious slave!

41:19.477 --> 41:21.712
Hold!

41:21.779 --> 41:23.346
This man.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.881
He is the one Attius helped free?

41:25.949 --> 41:29.384
The blacksmith held no knowledge of it.

41:29.452 --> 41:31.853
Your friend dead, because of her.

41:33.222 --> 41:37.191
<i>See them bound and taken to Spartacus.</i>

41:37.259 --> 41:39.827
They are his concern.

41:39.895 --> 41:41.061
Where do you go?

41:41.129 --> 41:44.231
To see memory of Attius
well fucking honored!

41:50.203 --> 41:51.970
None give rise to suspicion?

41:52.038 --> 41:54.239
They are eager for Roman blood.

41:54.306 --> 41:56.540
As any true to our cause should be.

41:56.608 --> 41:59.942
<i>Fabia...Fabia!</i>

42:02.646 --> 42:03.979
<i>Nemetes!</i>

42:04.047 --> 42:06.815
Break fucking words,
and knowledge of what you carry!

42:06.882 --> 42:08.750
One of the missing Romans!

42:12.654 --> 42:14.288
She came at me out of the shadows

42:14.356 --> 42:15.789
<i>half dead from attempted escape.</i>

42:17.358 --> 42:19.825
If it had not been for Lyciscus...

42:19.893 --> 42:24.362
You spare their lives,
and this is fucking gratitude!

42:24.430 --> 42:26.531
Fuck the Romans!

42:26.598 --> 42:28.733
Fuck the Roman cunts!

42:28.800 --> 42:30.534
Kill the fucking Romans!

42:35.639 --> 42:37.206
Fuck this.

42:37.274 --> 42:39.108
All should be struck from this world.

42:39.175 --> 42:41.910
<i>Fuck the Romans!</i>
<i>As you struck Attius from it?</i>

42:41.978 --> 42:43.746
Subject has been laid to rest, Gannicus.

42:43.813 --> 42:45.847
Along with fucking truth.

42:45.915 --> 42:48.182
<i>He aided the prisoners in escape.</i>

42:48.250 --> 42:49.484
And made attempt on my life
when I discovered...

42:49.551 --> 42:52.420
The Aedile's wife saw them free!

42:52.487 --> 42:53.954
How do you come upon this?

42:54.022 --> 42:57.056
Laeta hid them beneath the floor
of her husband's stables.

42:57.124 --> 43:00.826
Saxa carries her
and the others to Spartacus.

43:06.561 --> 43:08.892
It holds no matter.

43:08.960 --> 43:12.929
Attius was a Roman,
who fell to deserved fate.

43:12.996 --> 43:15.264
He was my friend, you mad bitch!

43:15.331 --> 43:16.732
Seize tongue, brother...

43:21.704 --> 43:23.137
<i>Get him, Gannicus!</i>

43:23.205 --> 43:25.339
<i>Kill him, get the fucker!</i>

43:37.817 --> 43:40.451
<i>Let's see what you're made of, Gannicus!</i>

43:48.092 --> 43:49.926
Come on, hit him!

43:53.663 --> 43:54.696
Gannicus!

44:04.171 --> 44:05.405
Calm yourself...

44:10.877 --> 44:12.077
Fuck you!

44:12.145 --> 44:13.278
<i>Come on!</i>

44:24.156 --> 44:25.356
Get up!

44:39.971 --> 44:41.038
Gannicus!

45:06.397 --> 45:08.331
He left me no choice.

45:08.399 --> 45:10.034
<i>He protects the Romans!</i>

45:10.102 --> 45:12.571
As does our mighty fucking leader!

45:12.638 --> 45:16.108
Is this what we have risked
all for in joining cause?!

45:17.310 --> 45:18.677
Spartacus gives command!

45:18.745 --> 45:20.412
And I would give my life,

45:20.480 --> 45:22.881
to feel enemy's blood hot upon cheek.

45:34.761 --> 45:39.398
We owe Spartacus our own lives.

45:42.002 --> 45:43.836
Yet he is wrong in this.

45:48.775 --> 45:50.342
A thing known by all.

45:55.049 --> 45:57.650
For every unwanted
touch placed upon you.

46:06.061 --> 46:11.332
For every chain around neck,
and every lash upon back!

46:13.035 --> 46:16.671
Take Roman blood as payment...

46:16.739 --> 46:20.175
and let us see this city truly ours!

46:46.168 --> 46:50.872
I will not do this.

46:50.939 --> 46:55.143
You shall do as commanded.

46:55.211 --> 46:56.778
As all soldiers must.

47:02.387 --> 47:04.892
Let it be done!

47:04.959 --> 47:08.233
Begin!

47:35.761 --> 47:36.828
No!

49:17.599 --> 49:22.202
Your lesson well learned.

49:22.270 --> 49:23.737
Imperator.

49:45.394 --> 49:47.995
<i>Each day brings new madness.</i>

49:48.063 --> 49:50.331
Next you will ask to join
in wresting moon

49:50.399 --> 49:51.566
from fucking heavens.

49:51.634 --> 49:53.802
He sets purpose towards
more earthly goal.

49:53.870 --> 49:55.237
<i>Does it lie within possibility,</i>

49:55.305 --> 49:57.606
what I seek to do?

49:57.673 --> 49:59.307
All dreams are possible...

49:59.375 --> 50:02.577
it is but effort and cost that
keeps it from waking grasp.

50:02.645 --> 50:05.780
See this last thing that
I ask of you to its end,

50:05.848 --> 50:07.816
and I will fill your ship

50:07.883 --> 50:11.052
with all the riches this city yet holds.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.553
Let us see it done then, brother!

50:13.622 --> 50:14.620
<i>Spartacus!</i>

50:14.688 --> 50:17.659
Crixus and the others have gone mad.

50:17.726 --> 50:22.030
They're killing the Romans.

50:22.097 --> 50:24.198
Keep watch over the Cilicians.

50:24.266 --> 50:26.368
You seem to favor their fucking company.

50:51.728 --> 50:53.662
Move, quickly!
Come on, quick!

50:53.730 --> 50:55.731
Uh, sorry.

50:55.799 --> 50:57.433
Oh, you must keep moving.

50:57.501 --> 50:59.035
We will not make it to the villa.

50:59.103 --> 51:01.938
No, you will not.

51:02.006 --> 51:03.773
These for Spartacus.

51:03.841 --> 51:05.174
Take from fucking path!

51:05.242 --> 51:07.577
I do not see Gannicus among you.

51:07.645 --> 51:09.612
Nor cause to heed his bitch!

51:13.284 --> 51:14.284
Ah!

51:14.352 --> 51:16.319
I give cause.

51:16.387 --> 51:17.587
Bitch.

51:19.056 --> 51:20.056
More Romans!

51:30.702 --> 51:34.005
<i>Oh my God please, hands off him!</i>

51:35.808 --> 51:37.875
The Aedile's wife!

52:08.274 --> 52:11.810
You will regain sense!

52:11.878 --> 52:13.512
Or fall where you stand!

52:13.580 --> 52:16.381
It is you who has lost sense.

52:16.449 --> 52:17.982
<i>And the Aedile's wife</i>

52:18.050 --> 52:23.622
who has seen you tumble from perch.

52:23.689 --> 52:28.059
<i>She is the one who helped</i>
<i>these Roman shits slip bond!</i>

52:28.127 --> 52:30.695
And smiled at you through fucking lies!

52:30.762 --> 52:33.865
<i>A thing of truth.</i>

52:33.932 --> 52:36.301
Attius held no part in it.

52:36.369 --> 52:38.537
Nor did he deserve the end that he met.

52:46.680 --> 52:51.584
This is return
for the mercy I grant you?

52:52.986 --> 52:55.054
Mercy?

52:55.122 --> 52:59.325
You robbed me of my husband.

52:59.393 --> 53:03.029
<i>Your people slaughtered</i>
<i>thousands within my city.</i>

53:03.097 --> 53:04.264
And I now stand condemned,

53:04.332 --> 53:07.500
for trying to save
but a handful from such cruelty?

53:09.531 --> 53:13.598
Learned at the hand of our Roman master.

53:13.666 --> 53:16.034
<i>Take her life, brother.</i>

53:16.101 --> 53:20.605
And in the act let us become
as one again.

53:25.010 --> 53:28.713
A thing deserved.

53:28.781 --> 53:32.783
Yet I will not see us become
the very thing we fight against.

53:34.919 --> 53:38.155
There are many who question
your mind in this.

53:38.223 --> 53:40.290
I question mind as well...

53:46.298 --> 53:49.467
placing faith in you as a leader.

53:55.140 --> 53:58.609
See the Romans that yet live
gathered within my villa.

53:58.677 --> 54:02.713
Make further attempt against my will...

54:02.781 --> 54:05.616
follow those you have
struck down this night.

54:13.186 --> 54:15.894
The man has helped us more than anyone.

54:15.962 --> 54:21.800
Yet I now doubt path he travels.

54:21.867 --> 54:26.559
Then perhaps the time has come,
to forge our own.
