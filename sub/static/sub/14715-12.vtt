WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.488
<i>Previously on Greenleaf.</i>

00:02.513 --> 00:07.117
Job 3:26.

00:07.151 --> 00:08.652
"I am not at rest,

00:08.686 --> 00:09.653
<i>nor am I quiet."</i>

00:09.687 --> 00:11.544
Pastor Skanks?

00:12.723 --> 00:14.306
Pastor Greenleaf.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.126
Bishop send you over here
to put me in my place?

00:16.160 --> 00:19.663
- No, I came on my own.
- Why? You looking for a job?

00:19.697 --> 00:21.994
I could be, yeah.

00:22.867 --> 00:25.101
- Grace Greenleaf?
- Yeah, that's me.

00:25.136 --> 00:26.368
How can I help you?

00:28.208 --> 00:31.208
- What is it?
- Ray wants custody of Sophia.

00:31.242 --> 00:34.105
We have had Women's Day
at the Peabody Hotel

00:34.130 --> 00:35.645
every year for 35 years.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.953
Well, then somebody needs to get
the deacon board here

00:37.978 --> 00:38.882
to sign the check.

00:38.916 --> 00:40.584
I look forward
to working with you, Kevin.

00:40.618 --> 00:43.153
- Yeah, me, too.
- Who are you?

00:43.187 --> 00:46.056
I'm the only child you have
that hasn't lied.

00:46.090 --> 00:47.057
I was so proud of you this morning,

00:47.091 --> 00:48.925
standing up to your mama like that.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.328
Then you'll really like this.

00:51.362 --> 00:52.829
Until you come clean with me

00:52.863 --> 00:54.731
about whatever's been going on with you,

00:54.765 --> 00:55.932
I want you out of our bed.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.524 --> 01:21.520
Hey.

01:22.526 --> 01:23.417
Hey.

01:24.895 --> 01:26.696
Where are you off to so early?

01:26.731 --> 01:28.665
I'm meeting Carlton
for a walk around the lake.

01:28.699 --> 01:31.701
- Wait up a second.
- I don't want to be late.

01:32.337 --> 01:34.529
What am I still doing
down here, Charity?

01:35.442 --> 01:37.267
Living the private life you enjoy.

01:37.301 --> 01:39.175
It's not very private.

01:39.210 --> 01:40.744
Well, you're not coming back to my bed.

01:40.778 --> 01:42.260
Why? Because of a phone?

01:42.379 --> 01:43.345
Tone.

01:45.521 --> 01:48.121
It's not the phone, and you know it.

01:48.552 --> 01:49.586
It's us.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.222
It's the way we feel.

01:52.256 --> 01:54.032
How about the way I feel?

01:54.792 --> 01:56.760
- I'm those babies' daddy.
- I know.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.695
And I wish you'd act like it.

01:58.729 --> 02:00.386
That's what I'm trying to do.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.966
No, what you're doing is telling me

02:03.000 --> 02:05.001
how it's going to be, and it's not.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.938
What do you want me to say?

02:14.170 --> 02:15.204
I got to go.

02:21.852 --> 02:24.988
Is Basie asking Bishop
for permission to hire you?

02:25.022 --> 02:27.791
- No.
- <i>Well, that's what it sounds like,</i>

02:27.825 --> 02:28.925
coming to Bishop on bended knee

02:28.959 --> 02:30.438
to ask for my husband's hand.

02:30.472 --> 02:32.929
No, he's just being up front about it.

02:32.963 --> 02:34.532
That's how he does things.

02:35.266 --> 02:35.996
Hmm.

02:39.252 --> 02:40.603
I know what this is about.

02:41.252 --> 02:42.972
What is this about?

02:43.007 --> 02:45.909
The fact that Alexa
goes to Triumph now, right?

02:45.943 --> 02:47.077
That's it, isn't it?

02:49.477 --> 02:53.188
Look, baby, that's over.

02:54.588 --> 02:56.753
I don't want anybody else ever again.

02:59.557 --> 03:01.372
I love when you wear
these sleeveless dresses.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.195
You got the sexiest arms in the world.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.448
You know if Bishop does say yes,

03:09.482 --> 03:10.490
we're going to have to move, right?

03:10.515 --> 03:12.458
There's no way your mother's going
to let us stay here.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.961
You and me, we'll work it out.

03:19.414 --> 03:20.300
Zora!

03:22.363 --> 03:23.630
Zora, turn that music down!

03:30.171 --> 03:31.805
So, what do I say?

03:31.839 --> 03:33.786
Just that you want to live with me.

03:35.009 --> 03:36.709
With Dad standing right there?

03:37.267 --> 03:39.612
I don't know.

03:39.647 --> 03:41.948
- Man.
- Who's that?

03:41.982 --> 03:43.410
It's your Aunt Mavis.

03:44.118 --> 03:46.252
Have you seen her since Uncle
Mac got arrested?

03:46.287 --> 03:47.687
Or even talked to her?

03:47.721 --> 03:50.356
No, but I've been dealing
with this, you know?

03:50.391 --> 03:52.926
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.993
You guys look great together.

03:54.028 --> 03:55.829
Thanks, so Sophia wants to know

03:55.863 --> 03:57.797
if Ray has to be present
when she testifies.

03:57.832 --> 03:59.098
Not if you don't want him to be.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.400
Okay.

04:04.004 --> 04:04.971
Connie.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.174
How's the decorating going?

04:08.209 --> 04:10.810
It's an awfully big room, Mae.

04:10.845 --> 04:13.374
Oh, well, we have
a hundred women signed up.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.882
We're down to 86, actually.

04:15.916 --> 04:20.987
Oh. So, can we cut the room in half?

04:21.021 --> 04:23.223
We can, and that boy in charge

04:23.257 --> 04:25.151
showed me what that would look like.

04:25.186 --> 04:26.964
Not the effect you want.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.795
So, what would you suggest?

04:28.829 --> 04:33.116
Well, Felicia's daughter Roxanne

04:33.667 --> 04:35.300
works at the Riverbluff on Union.

04:35.334 --> 04:37.003
The Riverbluff? Connie!

04:37.037 --> 04:38.037
It's just been renovated,

04:38.072 --> 04:40.173
and they've got a smaller event room

04:40.207 --> 04:42.176
that we can get for a third...

04:42.210 --> 04:43.776
But I paid half the deposit

04:43.811 --> 04:45.778
for the Peabody ballroom myself.

04:45.803 --> 04:47.714
It's not just about the money.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.332
It's about showing the deacons

04:49.367 --> 04:51.584
that you and James understand.

04:52.621 --> 04:53.720
Understand what?

04:53.945 --> 04:55.954
How bad things have gotten.

04:56.993 --> 05:00.894
Misty Williams said that having
Women's Day at the Peabody

05:00.928 --> 05:04.425
is like fiddling while Rome burns.

05:05.521 --> 05:07.065
Misty Williams?

05:07.101 --> 05:10.036
And she's not the only one
who has that opinion, either.

05:11.184 --> 05:13.606
I'm not going to the Riverbluff.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.942
I'll make you a deal.

05:15.976 --> 05:17.776
I'll keep Misty quiet

05:18.279 --> 05:21.547
if you get James to let Grace
preach for the summer.

05:21.952 --> 05:22.849
Grace?

05:22.883 --> 05:24.666
She's almost destroyed the church!

05:24.701 --> 05:25.652
If Rome is burning,

05:25.686 --> 05:27.657
it's because she set it on fire.

05:28.238 --> 05:32.085
Well, that girl also raked in

05:32.120 --> 05:35.795
the single largest offering of the year,

05:35.829 --> 05:38.936
and the church needs money.

05:39.641 --> 05:41.526
James is the church.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.604
Nobody's talking about
replacing the bishop for good.

05:44.638 --> 05:46.832
Don't get all dignified.

05:47.374 --> 05:49.153
It'll just be temporary.

05:50.294 --> 05:52.244
You sound like it's decided.

05:52.902 --> 05:54.575
Well, I hope so.

05:55.115 --> 05:58.733
We can't go through another
three months like the last one.

06:00.054 --> 06:01.087
No.

06:04.246 --> 06:05.984
I'll talk to James.

06:06.685 --> 06:08.079
Thank you, Mae.

06:08.862 --> 06:10.330
I knew you'd listen to reason.

06:10.364 --> 06:11.664
I told Misty you would.

06:19.106 --> 06:21.641
I know I haven't been a
perfect parent by any means.

06:21.675 --> 06:23.811
I've had my struggles, obviously.

06:24.446 --> 06:26.980
But I've been clean and
sober now for eight years,

06:27.545 --> 06:31.584
and this whole thing with Grace

06:31.618 --> 06:33.687
<i>bringing Sophia here
without my knowledge,</i>

06:33.721 --> 06:35.965
it's been a real wake-up call.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.754
All I want is a chance
to be a better father

06:39.788 --> 06:40.933
while there's still time.

06:41.628 --> 06:43.190
Thank you, Mr. Fisher.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.265
Now, if everyone will please excuse us,

06:46.300 --> 06:50.672
I'd like to have the CASA and the
younger Miss Greenleaf remain.

07:07.721 --> 07:10.390
Hey, how you doing, Pastor?

07:10.424 --> 07:11.919
Does it usually take this long?

07:12.554 --> 07:13.680
Sometimes.

07:13.714 --> 07:14.761
Okay.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.501
- Here we go.
- Ma'am.

07:23.771 --> 07:24.904
Judge: <i>Bottom line,</i>

07:24.938 --> 07:27.985
<i>based on everything I've heard today,</i>

07:28.019 --> 07:30.877
I'm recommending that at the
end of the school year,

07:30.911 --> 07:34.080
which I understand
is two weeks from today,

07:34.114 --> 07:37.777
Miss Greenleaf be remanded
into the custody of her father

07:37.811 --> 07:40.987
<i>for a period of no less than 90 days,</i>

07:41.309 --> 07:43.384
after which time the requirements

07:43.419 --> 07:46.292
of the original shared custody agreement

07:46.326 --> 07:48.734
will once again obtain.

07:49.663 --> 07:52.131
<i>This court is in recess.</i>

07:54.201 --> 07:56.102
<i>♪ Amen</i>

07:59.673 --> 08:01.174
<i>♪ Amen</i>

08:08.749 --> 08:11.017
<i>♪ Well</i>

08:23.630 --> 08:26.666
<i>♪ Amen, amen, ooh.</i>

08:42.806 --> 08:44.118
So, what are we going to tell them?

08:44.139 --> 08:45.768
- The truth.
- Wich part of it?

08:45.793 --> 08:47.160
You came looking for me,

08:47.195 --> 08:48.495
and you said you were looking for a job.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.730
We want to show him
the respect he deserves.

08:50.765 --> 08:53.099
Mmm. God is good.

08:53.134 --> 08:55.369
- Don't you worry, Pastor.
- I'm not worried.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.275
Sophia. Sophia? Sophia, honey.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.494
Come on. What did you say in there?

09:04.528 --> 09:06.154
That I wanted to live with you.

09:06.188 --> 09:07.330
Is that all you said?

09:07.355 --> 09:08.544
Yeah, basically.

09:08.569 --> 09:09.636
Basically or that's all you said?

09:09.670 --> 09:11.095
That's basically all I said.

09:11.662 --> 09:12.640
And then he said,

09:12.675 --> 09:14.574
"I appreciate that you feel
that way, Miss Greenleaf,

09:14.608 --> 09:16.343
but your mother broke the law."

09:19.714 --> 09:20.814
Can I take this girl to lunch?

09:21.236 --> 09:22.644
Or do you have to get to school?

09:24.132 --> 09:25.534
Just have her back there by one.

09:26.220 --> 09:28.645
Will do. Come on.

09:33.194 --> 09:35.095
So, does this mean that if he
doesn't want her to live here

09:35.129 --> 09:36.596
after the summer's over,
that I can't either?

09:38.492 --> 09:39.559
Not if you want to see her.

09:50.177 --> 09:54.047
I just think I'm ready to
make a move, up my game.

09:54.605 --> 09:57.880
And the pastor here seems like
he's ready to do the same.

09:58.552 --> 09:59.953
Why not join forces?

10:00.390 --> 10:03.123
And you came here to inform me?

10:03.157 --> 10:05.925
Because I know if Jacob's in
a secretive state of mind

10:05.960 --> 10:07.052
where he can't give 100 percent,

10:07.087 --> 10:08.762
<i>I won't be getting my money's worth,</i>

10:08.796 --> 10:10.797
<i>- and the Lord won't either.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

10:10.831 --> 10:13.032
You know, at the end of the day,

10:13.067 --> 10:16.102
getting the Gospel into the
peoples' hearts is the mission.

10:16.137 --> 10:19.005
I'm not concerned with who's
at whose church or whatever.

10:19.039 --> 10:20.607
Oh, obviously.

10:20.641 --> 10:22.809
And I just know
that having your blessing

10:22.843 --> 10:25.414
is going to empower this man
to take up his mantle

10:25.449 --> 10:26.579
<i>in a whole new ministry,</i>

10:27.205 --> 10:28.972
and that excites me.

10:32.987 --> 10:33.953
So, what do you say?

10:34.769 --> 10:38.960
Well, from a purely
objective standpoint,

10:39.628 --> 10:41.929
seems like a good opportunity
for the both of you.

10:41.964 --> 10:44.839
- Yes, Lord.
- I wish it wasn't in Memphis.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.001
With Kerissa's school being here,

10:47.035 --> 10:48.536
<i>your options are limited.</i>

10:48.570 --> 10:51.404
You know, it actually might
be a great sign of unity,

10:51.867 --> 10:55.047
after all Calvary and
Triumph have been through,

10:55.927 --> 10:57.863
to be bound together in this way.

10:59.190 --> 11:02.867
Well, you have my blessing.

11:03.456 --> 11:04.456
Amen.

11:07.285 --> 11:09.256
<i>Would you excuse us, Pastor?</i>

11:10.091 --> 11:11.659
Oh, by all means.

11:15.864 --> 11:16.831
Bishop.

11:29.945 --> 11:31.679
You're going to
have to tell your mother.

11:36.785 --> 11:37.852
I know.

11:41.523 --> 11:43.312
I never will understand
how you drink that.

11:43.346 --> 11:44.892
- What is it?
- It's whey.

11:44.926 --> 11:46.327
- Unh-uh.
- Try it.

11:46.864 --> 11:48.896
- No.
- It has no flavor.

11:48.930 --> 11:50.865
Which means it tastes like a mouth.

11:50.899 --> 11:53.159
<i>- Yuck.
- It's good for you.</i>

11:55.575 --> 11:57.405
Any word from TACS?

11:58.555 --> 12:00.108
Between me and you, no.

12:00.189 --> 12:01.776
And I thought with
the higher test scores

12:01.810 --> 12:03.708
that the turnaround time
would be quicker.

12:03.743 --> 12:05.379
Maybe they're giving us an award.

12:05.414 --> 12:07.826
Yeah, they can keep the award, okay?

12:07.860 --> 12:10.251
And just send me
my accreditation papers.

12:10.285 --> 12:12.336
We don't get that accreditation
by the deadline...

12:12.370 --> 12:13.454
We'll get accredited.

12:14.021 --> 12:15.256
You got a feeling?

12:16.061 --> 12:17.458
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:17.492 --> 12:19.060
Okay.

12:19.646 --> 12:21.221
But I'll send up a prayer anyway.

12:21.563 --> 12:23.133
Well, every little bit helps.

12:27.198 --> 12:28.533
Hi, handsome.

12:30.030 --> 12:32.491
Well, how did it go?

12:36.203 --> 12:38.429
If you think Davina is going
to be leading the singing

12:38.463 --> 12:40.548
while you're having those
babies, you are tripping.

12:40.582 --> 12:42.550
I would sooner FaceTime you in,

12:42.584 --> 12:44.719
put you up on that screen pushing...

12:44.753 --> 12:46.921
♪ Joy to the world...

12:48.089 --> 12:49.590
You are crazy.

12:49.624 --> 12:53.361
Oh. Let me catch up
with you in a minute.

12:53.395 --> 12:55.896
Okay, but that's my final decision.

12:55.931 --> 12:58.466
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.501
And it was over in, like, ten minutes.

13:00.535 --> 13:01.869
We even prayed afterward.

13:01.903 --> 13:03.871
Hey, look, Charity just walked in.

13:03.905 --> 13:05.439
Let me talk to her and I'll give you

13:05.474 --> 13:08.342
all the details when I get home, okay?

13:08.377 --> 13:09.543
Love you.

13:12.107 --> 13:13.614
Before you say anything,

13:13.648 --> 13:15.339
no one left you out of anything.

13:15.373 --> 13:16.995
Who didn't leave me out of what?

13:17.570 --> 13:18.670
What's going on around here?

13:19.915 --> 13:22.649
- I'm shipping out.
- To go where?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.287
I took a job at Triumph.

13:25.321 --> 13:28.529
- What?
- Yeah, you heard right.

13:31.046 --> 13:32.933
I'm going to be
associate pastor over there.

13:32.968 --> 13:34.936
Jake, you can't do that.

13:34.971 --> 13:37.004
- Who says?
- Does Daddy know?

13:37.038 --> 13:38.539
He's fine with it.

13:38.573 --> 13:40.416
I find that hard to believe.

13:41.424 --> 13:43.152
Just sat down with me and Basie Skanks

13:43.187 --> 13:44.745
and gave me his blessing.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.380
Basie Skanks was in this building?

13:46.415 --> 13:48.571
Yeah.

13:49.084 --> 13:50.384
Does Mama know about it?

13:50.419 --> 13:53.428
No, and don't tell her, either.

13:53.922 --> 13:57.582
Look, I'll sit down with her soon

13:57.616 --> 13:59.241
and explain it all.

13:59.775 --> 14:01.896
Jake, she's going to
throw you out of the house.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.275
You know that, right?

14:05.065 --> 14:05.965
Maybe it's time to go.

14:17.812 --> 14:19.413
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner,

14:19.448 --> 14:21.230
but we just decided this morning.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.390
Jacob...

14:25.263 --> 14:28.355
We're still going to
see each other, right?

14:31.893 --> 14:33.494
I got to go.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.230
I got to do something.

14:36.302 --> 14:37.498
I know.

14:40.261 --> 14:41.669
I guess...

14:42.310 --> 14:43.811
I just don't know what to say.

14:46.078 --> 14:47.575
Try congratulations.

14:49.911 --> 14:51.331
Congratulations.

14:52.877 --> 14:53.714
Jerk.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.758
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.126
I just talked to our partners

15:05.160 --> 15:07.220
about the possibility of an appeal...

15:07.255 --> 15:08.040
Okay.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.557
...and this seems to be the consensus.

15:11.430 --> 15:13.254
You're going to have to
give her up for the summer.

15:13.668 --> 15:16.387
And as far as appealing the terms
of the original agreement...

15:16.781 --> 15:17.581
It's hopeless.

15:17.606 --> 15:19.097
No, it's just not easy.

15:19.626 --> 15:20.574
You can appeal the ruling

15:20.609 --> 15:22.843
by filing a motion for reconsideration,

15:22.878 --> 15:24.445
but you may end up with the same judge.

15:24.479 --> 15:25.479
And even if you don't,

15:25.514 --> 15:27.490
by the time you're done fighting,

15:27.525 --> 15:28.837
Sophia will be in college.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.578
What if I take her to Mexico?

15:31.613 --> 15:32.974
You're not the first client of mine

15:32.999 --> 15:34.150
to say that this week, actually.

15:34.185 --> 15:35.731
- I was kidding.
- He was not.

15:35.765 --> 15:37.858
And just so you know, you go to jail.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.727
I can't believe that
he can literally ignore her

15:39.761 --> 15:41.729
for months at a time for years

15:42.288 --> 15:44.936
and then just get her like this.

15:44.971 --> 15:46.433
Well, normally, he couldn't.

15:47.762 --> 15:49.682
But I broke the law, I know.

15:53.776 --> 15:55.509
I really am a Greenleaf.

15:56.772 --> 15:57.738
<i>So, what do you want to do?</i>

15:59.432 --> 16:01.040
<i>Draw up a draft of the motion</i>

16:01.173 --> 16:02.575
just so I can see what it looks like.

16:02.855 --> 16:04.301
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:04.790 --> 16:08.026
- No worries.
- Thanks, Mike, for doing all of this.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.561
I'll stop by tomorrow so you
can see what it looks like.

16:09.595 --> 16:12.781
Okay.

16:12.816 --> 16:14.360
Man: <i>Mavis McCready for you.</i>

16:19.232 --> 16:20.538
Call back.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.367
Got a minute, Daddy?

16:29.402 --> 16:30.929
For you? Always.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.403
What can I do for you, child?

16:35.975 --> 16:39.744
Well, Jacob told me he's leaving.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.949
For browner pastures, yeah.

16:45.718 --> 16:46.651
Are you okay with that?

16:48.308 --> 16:52.257
No, but when you have children,

16:52.291 --> 16:53.792
there comes a day when,

16:54.423 --> 16:56.733
just like the Lord did
with Adam and Eve,

16:56.768 --> 16:58.473
you just have to let them wander down

16:58.498 --> 16:59.731
off into the garden.

17:00.385 --> 17:01.733
It's the only way.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.753
I'll tell you what.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.564
Why don't you...

17:12.011 --> 17:14.512
why don't you take his office
once he's out of there?

17:14.547 --> 17:16.882
- Are you sure?
- Oh, positive.

17:16.915 --> 17:18.561
You work so hard,

17:18.596 --> 17:21.118
and I know you get tired
with those babies.

17:21.153 --> 17:22.753
You deserve a little
private place to rest.

17:24.723 --> 17:25.991
If you're sure.

17:26.611 --> 17:29.436
Charity, to see you in that office

17:29.471 --> 17:33.131
will be the silver lining
I've been praying for all day.

17:37.336 --> 17:38.236
Okay.

17:39.405 --> 17:40.171
Thank you, Daddy.

17:40.205 --> 17:42.908
Oh, my pleasure.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.968
_

18:12.993 --> 18:14.993
_

18:15.049 --> 18:17.915
_

18:18.044 --> 18:20.745
Under no circumstances should
you let him in the building.

18:20.780 --> 18:23.148
Lady Mae does not want him
in the building, period.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.509
- Hey.
- FYI? Really?

18:25.888 --> 18:27.414
Can you guys close that for me, please?

18:29.435 --> 18:32.757
- Thanks. You got my email.
- Yeah.

18:32.792 --> 18:34.960
I just wanted you to know that Isabel
was going to be at Women's Day.

18:34.994 --> 18:37.228
So, come and tell me to my face.

18:37.263 --> 18:38.763
Are you guys getting back together?

18:38.798 --> 18:40.098
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

18:40.132 --> 18:43.125
- Are you?
- We're talking about it.

18:45.137 --> 18:46.071
What?

18:48.074 --> 18:49.322
Nothing.

18:53.679 --> 18:54.879
I thought I'd be

18:54.914 --> 18:56.247
at the Southern Poverty Law Center

18:56.282 --> 18:57.436
for the rest of my life.

18:58.017 --> 19:02.287
You know, Yale, that's kind
of like the Emerald City,

19:02.321 --> 19:03.900
and I love Montgomery.

19:05.024 --> 19:09.327
- So, what happened?
- I was stupid.

19:09.362 --> 19:11.062
I got involved with a guy
that got transferred out here,

19:11.097 --> 19:12.731
and I sent out my resume,

19:12.765 --> 19:15.734
and, well, I won't do that again.

19:21.407 --> 19:24.042
So, here we are.

19:25.411 --> 19:26.910
Yeah, uh...

19:28.412 --> 19:30.815
- it's a nice place.
- Yeah.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.784
You know, I got to tell you,

19:33.453 --> 19:34.918
I appreciate you
bringing us into the church,

19:34.954 --> 19:37.722
but I was relieved when it ended.

19:37.757 --> 19:40.191
I mean, I hope that wasn't too obvious.

19:40.226 --> 19:42.293
Relieved because...

19:42.328 --> 19:43.762
You know,

19:44.568 --> 19:47.514
for the freedom to do this...

19:48.467 --> 19:51.036
and whatever happens next.

19:53.906 --> 19:55.744
- Okay, um...
- What?

19:55.778 --> 19:58.743
Look, I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

19:58.778 --> 20:00.912
- No, don't do that.
- Don't do what?

20:02.145 --> 20:03.815
Why are we at dinner?

20:05.351 --> 20:06.424
Because...

20:10.775 --> 20:11.842
I don't know.

20:13.398 --> 20:16.189
Look, Adrian, I'm not gay.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.388
Okay. All right.
So, you do a guy sometimes.

20:19.423 --> 20:21.800
- You know, I get it.
- I don't do that.

20:22.717 --> 20:24.295
I've told you, I've never done it.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.772
So, you're telling me

20:28.740 --> 20:30.241
you've never flirted with me?

20:40.820 --> 20:45.957
Adrian, I'm straight... and married.

20:46.604 --> 20:49.627
Yeah, with two babies on the way.

20:49.662 --> 20:50.729
I know.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.254
Have you seen your office?

21:02.288 --> 21:04.580
Oh, we're not going to do
any of that until tomorrow...

21:04.614 --> 21:05.844
<i>HR, the whole thing.</i>

21:05.878 --> 21:07.818
<i>But, really, the offices over there,</i>

21:07.853 --> 21:08.913
<i>they aren't anything special.</i>

21:08.948 --> 21:10.849
He puts all his money into programs.

21:11.212 --> 21:14.251
Hmm. It's fun to see you so inspired.

21:14.286 --> 21:15.987
It's fun to be inspired.

21:16.021 --> 21:18.990
You know, if ten percent of the
people over there at that church

21:19.025 --> 21:20.258
are as cool as he is,

21:20.451 --> 21:22.052
<i>it's going to be a whole new life, baby.</i>

21:25.272 --> 21:28.233
So, I'll be back in about an hour.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.501
I think I got ten miles in me today.

21:30.535 --> 21:33.294
Well, you can make it eight
and save two for me.

21:33.668 --> 21:34.873
Hell, yeah.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.908
Well, how about I run two

21:37.461 --> 21:38.710
and save the other eight for you?

21:38.744 --> 21:40.244
Okay, that works, too.

22:13.744 --> 22:15.712
Well, look who exists.

22:28.060 --> 22:29.301
Hey, Mama.

22:30.977 --> 22:34.065
Behold the future of Calvary.

22:36.402 --> 22:38.369
- May I?
- Yeah.

22:38.404 --> 22:39.938
I just had dinner,

22:39.972 --> 22:43.074
so they're doing their
karate moves in there.

22:43.108 --> 22:46.444
- Oh!
- He loves you.

22:46.478 --> 22:47.928
Mama, can I ask you a question?

22:47.962 --> 22:48.980
You may.

22:50.310 --> 22:51.950
Is there something wrong with Daddy?

22:54.605 --> 22:55.572
What do you mean?

22:55.652 --> 22:56.604
I saw him today,

22:56.638 --> 22:57.410
and it seemed like

22:57.445 --> 22:59.611
his hand was shaking or something.

22:59.636 --> 23:00.636
Is he all right?

23:02.239 --> 23:03.439
You'll have to ask him.

23:04.156 --> 23:05.730
So, there is something wrong.

23:06.631 --> 23:08.069
Ask him.

23:08.701 --> 23:10.138
Mama.

23:11.136 --> 23:13.132
There's no need for you to worry.

23:13.405 --> 23:15.443
You stay positive.

23:15.808 --> 23:18.647
Those boys feel everything you feel...

23:18.770 --> 23:20.021
everything.

23:23.390 --> 23:27.018
Have the two of you
started picking names?

23:27.816 --> 23:29.278
Sorry, I can go back upstairs.

23:29.313 --> 23:31.243
No, no. I was just going to bed.

23:33.043 --> 23:34.374
Night, Mama.

23:35.647 --> 23:36.547
Love you.

23:39.657 --> 23:40.557
Good night.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.774
In all my years of marriage,

23:47.808 --> 23:50.208
I never put Bishop on the sofa.

23:50.242 --> 23:53.248
And if I had, he wouldn't
have let it go on this long.

23:53.283 --> 23:55.280
I know, Ma. I tried.

23:55.314 --> 23:59.328
Try? You better stop trying
and do something, boy.

23:59.362 --> 24:01.657
- Make this right.
- It's not entirely up to me.

24:01.692 --> 24:02.987
Charity's hard work, Ma. What you want?

24:03.022 --> 24:08.748
Kevin, I have no idea what is
going on with the two of you.

24:12.121 --> 24:13.773
But here's what I know.

24:15.195 --> 24:16.833
It is up to you.

24:17.221 --> 24:18.254
You're the man.

24:19.392 --> 24:22.189
Don't you understand that your children

24:22.224 --> 24:24.917
are already existing inside that woman?

24:26.345 --> 24:31.548
Already forming in this
cloud of unpleasantness?

24:32.133 --> 24:36.481
Your boys need to feel
safe and secure right now,

24:36.515 --> 24:41.198
not anxious and unsettled and sad.

24:44.258 --> 24:48.187
Trust me, you will disappoint
your children sometimes,

24:48.221 --> 24:51.235
but there's no need to start so soon.

24:54.926 --> 24:55.825
Okay.

25:04.283 --> 25:06.178
When did this happen?

25:07.034 --> 25:10.529
I got the notice of seizure from
the city a couple months ago.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.690
And you didn't call and tell me?

25:13.458 --> 25:14.775
And what would you have done?

25:16.334 --> 25:19.178
- Can you fight it?
- <i>I tried,</i>

25:19.212 --> 25:21.364
but whoever Mac has in his pocket

25:21.389 --> 25:23.807
at city hall ain't budging.

25:24.695 --> 25:26.671
<i>They gave me a nice check, though.</i>

25:27.178 --> 25:28.712
I'm so sorry.

25:28.778 --> 25:29.607
Don't be.

25:30.677 --> 25:33.354
You know, I knew when I
gave you that police report

25:33.388 --> 25:35.254
that I was poking in a beehive,

25:35.896 --> 25:39.161
so I surely cannot act surprised
now that I got stung.

25:39.696 --> 25:41.563
No, but you can still say ouch.

25:43.944 --> 25:45.778
So, how come it's been so hard

25:45.803 --> 25:47.250
to get ahold of you these days?

25:49.300 --> 25:52.990
And I don't want to hear,
"I've been so busy."

25:55.486 --> 25:56.753
I don't want to leave.

25:57.565 --> 25:59.070
Not yet, anyway.

26:00.137 --> 26:01.271
Why?

26:02.824 --> 26:05.076
I don't know, exactly.

26:05.110 --> 26:08.158
You feeling bad because
things are all falling apart?

26:10.729 --> 26:11.862
Don't.

26:12.829 --> 26:14.830
Your family's still your family.

26:15.128 --> 26:18.022
That church deserves to close.

26:18.057 --> 26:19.898
I'm not so sure about that.

26:19.933 --> 26:21.449
After what they did to Faith?

26:21.813 --> 26:24.069
Pushing her truth down into the dark

26:24.423 --> 26:25.842
<i>just so they can keep a shine</i>

26:25.876 --> 26:27.560
on that silver-plated cross?

26:27.585 --> 26:29.053
My parents are the ones
that did that to her,

26:29.120 --> 26:30.086
not the church.

26:30.159 --> 26:33.503
The church did that to them.

26:35.606 --> 26:39.009
The church did that to them.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.933
<i>I know you love your daddy,</i>

26:43.244 --> 26:44.484
<i>but, Gigi, that church,</i>

26:44.518 --> 26:46.285
I mean, just keeping the doors open

26:46.319 --> 26:48.518
turned him into some two-bit hustler

26:48.552 --> 26:51.438
and my sister some preening swan.

26:52.033 --> 26:56.544
And they go on and on,
the Lord this and Jesus,

26:57.400 --> 26:59.568
but it's really
just all about the money.

26:59.602 --> 27:01.602
Money, money, money.

27:01.637 --> 27:03.052
It is so much more than that.

27:03.087 --> 27:04.936
It is not.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.311
You came,

27:10.064 --> 27:11.741
you saw,

27:13.189 --> 27:14.222
and you conquered.

27:20.774 --> 27:21.819
Get out.

27:38.868 --> 27:41.240
I'll come and get you in the Mustang
when school's done.<i>.</i>

27:41.274 --> 27:43.654
We'll drive back with the top down.

27:43.688 --> 27:46.276
- 2,000 miles?
- Yeah.

27:46.310 --> 27:48.152
We'll stop anywhere you want.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.518
Already made arrangements with my chefs

27:50.543 --> 27:51.814
to cover me for two weeks.

27:52.581 --> 27:53.653
It'll be fun.

27:56.259 --> 27:57.159
Okay.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.530
I'm not going to apologize,

28:08.564 --> 28:10.058
because I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.034
She doesn't want to leave, Ray.

28:13.069 --> 28:14.469
Same old Grace.

28:14.503 --> 28:16.037
It's always everybody else's hard time.

28:16.072 --> 28:17.513
I'm going to appeal.

28:18.762 --> 28:21.010
And drag her from courtroom to courtroom

28:21.043 --> 28:23.452
from here to Phoenix and
back again over and over?

28:23.486 --> 28:24.541
Why?

28:26.082 --> 28:27.449
I'm not asking for anything

28:27.483 --> 28:29.084
that isn't within my rights to ask for.

28:30.717 --> 28:32.405
You screwed up.

28:33.329 --> 28:34.504
Deal with it.

28:36.428 --> 28:38.553
I'm sorry, honey, that's the truth.

28:38.588 --> 28:42.097
- Dad.
- Yes, sweetie?

28:44.506 --> 28:46.807
I don't want to leave.

28:49.038 --> 28:50.011
Come here.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.835
Hey, I'll see you in two weeks.

29:02.084 --> 29:04.052
Come on, sweetheart.

29:04.086 --> 29:05.253
Sweetheart. Sweetheart?

29:12.495 --> 29:15.735
Mr. Dorsey, do you have a second?

29:17.266 --> 29:20.101
Please. Release me. Let me go.

29:25.941 --> 29:27.650
Did you hear from TACS?

29:27.689 --> 29:28.756
No.

29:32.617 --> 29:34.449
My husband has just taken a position

29:34.483 --> 29:36.217
as associate pastor at Triumph.

29:39.088 --> 29:40.614
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

29:41.570 --> 29:43.004
I just wanted to tell you.

29:43.125 --> 29:45.339
He'll be around. We'll be around.

29:46.565 --> 29:48.596
Then I look forward to meeting this man

29:48.631 --> 29:49.870
I've heard so much about.

29:54.303 --> 29:56.255
You understand why I'm telling you.

29:57.339 --> 29:58.306
Completely.

29:58.696 --> 30:00.241
I'll keep a respectful distance

30:00.276 --> 30:01.609
and treat any bit of news

30:01.644 --> 30:03.927
as if it's just that... news.

30:04.580 --> 30:05.463
Thank you.

30:06.209 --> 30:07.209
No worries.

30:11.020 --> 30:13.520
Just promise me he won't start
moonlighting as a teacher next.

30:13.554 --> 30:15.094
I don't want to lose my lunch buddy.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.524
I promise.

30:26.569 --> 30:27.430
Hmm.

30:28.671 --> 30:30.494
So, when did all this happen?

30:31.320 --> 30:33.788
A couple weeks ago.

30:34.873 --> 30:36.678
But Daddy signed off on it yesterday,

30:36.712 --> 30:40.882
so I wanted to be the one
to tell you in person.

30:41.531 --> 30:42.691
Uh-huh.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.935
Well, I would have
preferred being consulted

30:46.969 --> 30:49.023
before it became <i>fait accompli.</i>

30:49.409 --> 30:50.893
Mama, I didn't want to
to give you a chance

30:50.926 --> 30:51.893
to try to talk me out of it.

30:52.586 --> 30:53.853
Like I could.

30:53.878 --> 30:57.788
Mama, you can talk a rose
out of smelling pretty.

31:02.336 --> 31:03.564
And just so you know,

31:04.204 --> 31:06.441
Kerissa and I have been
looking for places in town.

31:06.885 --> 31:08.015
What for?

31:09.544 --> 31:11.446
Because we're going to
need a place to live.

31:11.480 --> 31:15.450
Jacob, what kind of day would it be

31:15.901 --> 31:17.809
if I didn't see Winkie eating his cereal

31:17.843 --> 31:20.255
in the morning when I came downstairs?

31:22.621 --> 31:24.150
Don't be silly.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.093
You'll stay at the house.

31:27.996 --> 31:28.896
Hmm?

31:38.474 --> 31:39.407
Thank you, Mama.

31:40.290 --> 31:43.412
Well... hmm.

32:02.598 --> 32:03.845
What's that?

32:04.566 --> 32:08.036
This is a motion to appeal the
ruling the judge made yesterday.

32:08.553 --> 32:11.000
- Don't send it in.
- Why not, honey?

32:11.867 --> 32:15.010
Because... I don't want
to go to court again.

32:15.465 --> 32:16.911
That wasn't fun.

32:16.946 --> 32:18.918
So, we'll both move back to Phoenix.

32:18.953 --> 32:19.878
No!

32:21.550 --> 32:24.774
I'm not switching schools.
I just made friends here.

32:24.808 --> 32:27.952
It's bad enough I have to
go there for the summer.

32:28.312 --> 32:30.235
Sophia, if your dad doesn't
want you to live here,

32:30.269 --> 32:33.062
I can't do anything about it
unless we go to court.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.369
I hate this!

32:37.403 --> 32:39.657
Oh, I know, come here.
Come here. I know.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.437
No. I'm going to go call Zora.

33:06.363 --> 33:09.232
I was just about to come to bed.

33:13.358 --> 33:15.671
Or I could just sit right here

33:15.706 --> 33:17.507
and listen to whatever you have to say.

33:24.213 --> 33:27.215
Connie Sykes came to me
yesterday, James,

33:27.264 --> 33:32.951
with a suggestion, the unpalatability
of which cannot be measured.

33:33.431 --> 33:35.224
- Grace preaching.
- Yes.

33:35.259 --> 33:37.527
And she calls herself my friend.

33:37.561 --> 33:40.396
I told her that wasn't happening.

33:40.431 --> 33:43.264
Now Misty Williams is saying things.

33:43.967 --> 33:46.001
James, we have to get on the same page

33:46.143 --> 33:47.577
or Calvary's going to fly off

33:47.602 --> 33:48.736
in a hundred different directions!

33:51.831 --> 33:54.377
Your only son is going off to
work at another man's church.

33:54.411 --> 33:55.427
There's nothing for him here.

33:55.452 --> 33:56.898
No, it's fine.

33:56.932 --> 33:58.748
I'm not going to get into it now.

33:58.782 --> 34:00.238
He's off to Triumph.

34:01.470 --> 34:05.288
But in the meantime, you're not well.

34:06.230 --> 34:08.301
Things are falling through the cracks

34:08.335 --> 34:11.393
every day that Mac is in jail.
You know they are.

34:11.428 --> 34:14.030
And Gigi, the girl that's
betrayed the both of us,

34:14.063 --> 34:17.233
she's their sweet hope of what's
going to save this church

34:17.266 --> 34:19.435
- and turn it around?
- I'll talk to Connie again.

34:19.469 --> 34:21.054
And here's what
you're going to tell her.

34:21.672 --> 34:22.638
I am going to preach.

34:22.672 --> 34:25.608
Not you, not Grace. Me.

34:26.030 --> 34:29.312
- Just for a while, James.
- Mae, it's one thing

34:29.346 --> 34:30.612
to preach a sermon once a year

34:30.647 --> 34:32.581
about healthy living
and a godly lifestyle.

34:32.616 --> 34:33.583
Are you saying I can't do it?

34:33.617 --> 34:36.007
I'm saying you haven't done it.

34:36.978 --> 34:38.521
Why don't we give Amos Andrews a call?

34:38.554 --> 34:39.987
I'm sure he'd be happy to do a series.

34:40.013 --> 34:41.319
No. No.

34:41.353 --> 34:43.359
The way the jackals
are circling right now?

34:43.393 --> 34:45.998
No. We need a Greenleaf in the pulpit.

34:46.033 --> 34:48.737
We can't move from the spot!

34:49.600 --> 34:51.824
And it's not going to be that
hellcat of a daughter of mine.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.308
That's not going to happen...

34:54.571 --> 34:58.341
unless you come clean to me
about what Mac's got on you.

35:06.169 --> 35:07.858
I'll let Connie know.

35:24.701 --> 35:27.336
- Can we talk?
- Send me an email.

35:45.155 --> 35:49.632
- Hey.
- Hey. Can we talk?

35:50.198 --> 35:52.367
If you have something to say.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.598
Charity, I love you.

35:55.632 --> 35:57.166
I love you, too.

35:59.703 --> 36:00.720
Is that all?

36:02.459 --> 36:03.359
No.

36:08.891 --> 36:09.788
What, then?

36:15.185 --> 36:17.153
Something has been going on.

36:20.643 --> 36:22.505
And I've been hiding it in my phone.

36:23.827 --> 36:24.760
You were right.

36:26.630 --> 36:27.994
But, I, uh...

36:30.901 --> 36:32.168
I want to talk to you about it.

36:34.111 --> 36:35.218
Okay.

36:37.074 --> 36:41.683
The fact is, I don't want
to talk to you about it.

36:41.717 --> 36:43.701
I want to put it behind me, but...

36:48.124 --> 36:49.458
I have to tell you
if I want to be with you.

36:51.619 --> 36:52.659
That's true.

36:53.290 --> 36:58.471
And being with you and those babies

36:58.505 --> 36:59.584
is what I want, Charity.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.596
You got to believe me.

37:03.740 --> 37:04.740
So, what is it?

37:05.583 --> 37:06.919
What do you have to tell me?

37:07.954 --> 37:11.567
Whatever it is, we can deal with it.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.983
Just tell me the truth.

37:16.018 --> 37:19.215
I've been having feelings...

37:21.334 --> 37:23.085
About another woman.

37:25.162 --> 37:26.123
No.

37:27.130 --> 37:31.360
So... so, what...

37:31.395 --> 37:35.164
I haven't done anything.

37:38.235 --> 37:39.790
I figured they're just feelings.

37:40.822 --> 37:42.926
And I have prayed.

37:45.175 --> 37:46.767
Baby, I've been praying.

37:47.663 --> 37:49.092
- What...
- But they won't go away.

37:49.126 --> 37:51.080
What kind of feelings?

37:52.340 --> 37:54.617
What kind of feelings?

37:54.651 --> 37:55.618
Uh...

37:59.775 --> 38:00.675
Kevin!

38:03.073 --> 38:04.193
Feelings about...

38:08.632 --> 38:09.532
...about men.

38:11.802 --> 38:12.702
What does that mean?

38:14.237 --> 38:15.946
Kevin, what does that mean?

38:15.980 --> 38:16.973
I don't know.

38:18.971 --> 38:20.843
Look, but I love you.

38:20.877 --> 38:22.778
I want help. I want to fix this.

38:22.813 --> 38:23.779
I want to fix this.

38:23.814 --> 38:25.612
Are you gay?

38:28.911 --> 38:29.911
I don't know.

38:32.617 --> 38:33.595
Why...

38:34.457 --> 38:35.957
why would you do this?

38:41.131 --> 38:42.398
You're such a liar.

38:42.432 --> 38:44.100
- Baby, I love you.
- How can you?

38:44.134 --> 38:45.101
I do!

38:45.648 --> 38:47.688
What does that even mean?

38:49.573 --> 38:52.775
You sit here and tell me
you have feelings about men

38:52.809 --> 38:54.677
and you love me?

38:54.711 --> 38:57.146
- I love you.
- What does that mean?

38:57.180 --> 38:59.582
- Please!
- What does that...

39:02.352 --> 39:05.187
You're a liar!

39:05.222 --> 39:07.056
I hate you!

39:07.090 --> 39:09.280
Are you okay?

39:09.324 --> 39:10.524
Help!

39:11.428 --> 39:12.428
The thing is,

39:12.462 --> 39:13.429
I think I sent you that email

39:13.463 --> 39:15.131
because I was angry.

39:15.165 --> 39:18.134
- At me?
- No, not at you.

39:19.044 --> 39:20.405
At life.

39:21.671 --> 39:25.341
Before you came back, I was
really cool with Isabel.

39:25.532 --> 39:27.028
Like, I loved her.

39:27.844 --> 39:29.245
I wasn't thinking about you.

39:29.922 --> 39:34.007
But then you showed up,
and I thought that

39:34.040 --> 39:36.185
that life that I had dreamed
about as a little kid,

39:36.219 --> 39:40.122
that perfect life that
I'd almost given up on,

39:40.157 --> 39:41.778
was suddenly possible again.

39:42.969 --> 39:45.694
<i>But...</i>

39:47.374 --> 39:48.632
Do you hear that?

39:51.807 --> 39:52.837
Yeah.

39:59.959 --> 40:01.510
- What's going on?
- What happened?

40:01.545 --> 40:03.516
Something's wrong with the twins.

40:04.114 --> 40:05.781
Baby, you just stay calm.

40:05.816 --> 40:09.652
Remember, all things work together for
good for those who love the Lord.

40:09.686 --> 40:11.720
What's wrong with the babies, Gigi?

40:11.755 --> 40:13.027
I don't know.

40:13.657 --> 40:15.191
Mae: <i>We'll be there, sweetheart.</i>

40:15.225 --> 40:16.492
<i>We're going to come right now.</i>

40:19.357 --> 40:21.530
Kevin? Kevin...

40:21.565 --> 40:24.166
Man: <i>Anybody know what
hospital they're going to?</i>

40:34.711 --> 40:36.645
Doctor: <i>Well, they're stable for now.</i>

40:36.680 --> 40:37.897
Oh, thank God.

40:37.932 --> 40:39.515
But your blood pressure is high.

40:39.549 --> 40:40.929
I want to keep you overnight.

40:41.685 --> 40:42.890
Whatever they need.

40:43.553 --> 40:45.254
I just want them to be healthy.

40:46.520 --> 40:47.825
Are you under a lot of stress?

40:50.143 --> 40:52.294
No. No more than most people.

40:52.329 --> 40:54.430
Doctor, she works seven days a week,

40:54.464 --> 40:56.298
and our family's been going
through a lot of stress

40:56.333 --> 40:57.700
over the last few months,

40:57.734 --> 41:01.237
and her husband is
sleeping on the couch.

41:01.824 --> 41:04.332
<i>Well, I can't speak to that last part,</i>

41:04.866 --> 41:07.643
but assuming your babies'
vitals are normal come morning,

41:07.677 --> 41:09.496
I'm ordering you on a full bed rest

41:09.521 --> 41:11.082
for the remainder of this pregnancy.

41:11.499 --> 41:12.466
Whatever it takes.

41:13.055 --> 41:13.749
Okay.

41:14.122 --> 41:16.246
Then I'll let you folks
say your good nights,

41:16.280 --> 41:17.947
<i>and then you should go</i>

41:17.982 --> 41:19.388
and let this lady get some sleep.

41:19.422 --> 41:21.490
- Thank you so much, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

41:25.514 --> 41:26.481
You want me to stay?

41:26.748 --> 41:29.192
No. We'll be okay.

41:29.353 --> 41:30.453
Okay.

41:32.702 --> 41:33.802
Thank you, Mama.

41:33.837 --> 41:35.271
<i>I love you.</i>

41:35.305 --> 41:36.605
I love you.

41:46.063 --> 41:47.715
You can go home, too.

41:49.252 --> 41:51.131
Charity, I'm not going anywhere, baby.

41:51.166 --> 41:52.121
I love you.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.428
Just be quiet.

41:55.731 --> 41:57.159
Please.
