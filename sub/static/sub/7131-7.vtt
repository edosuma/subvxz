00:11.917 --> 00:16.041
- I have been hearing such great
things about your new show.

00:16.041 --> 00:17.125
- Have you?
- Oh, that's so nice.

00:17.125 --> 00:19.959
- Word around town?
A-ma-zing.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.041
- Lunch is on me.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.542
- Lunch is always on you.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.500
What'd help is a job.
You got one of those?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.166
- [chuckling]
Hey, I'm not a magician.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.250
- Yeah, well, you better
pull something out of your ass.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.458
- What magic shows
did you go to?

00:30.458 --> 00:32.667
- I need a pet name for Helen.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.500
- Really?
Pet names already?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.417
- I know.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.667
It's like we're on some kind
of accelerated lesbian calendar.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.000
Like, three days is a week.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.166
If I were a dog,
I'd be dead by now.

01:40.542 --> 01:41.917

01:41.917 --> 01:43.333
It's the set model
for our new show.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.208
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:45.208 --> 01:48.709
They're actually building
the entire house on the stage.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.208
Three stories,
and all these walls come out,

01:52.208 --> 01:55.458
so they can shoot from one floor
to another.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.917
- Huh.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.250
Anyway, you got to see this.

02:01.834 --> 02:04.667
- Well, that's a vagina.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.417
- Yeah. My kid did it.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.458
- Aw, even more disturbing.

02:09.458 --> 02:12.834
- Not the six-year-old,
the eight-year-old.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.041
- How are you not in prison?

02:14.041 --> 02:15.542
- Come on. It's art.

02:15.542 --> 02:16.625
- Or evidence.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.083
- Picture's up.

02:18.083 --> 02:19.875
- All right,
got to go be somewhat amusing.

02:19.875 --> 02:20.917
Can I leave this here?

02:20.917 --> 02:22.125
- No.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.583
Please take your twat and go.

02:24.583 --> 02:25.917
- [scoffs]

02:25.917 --> 02:27.750
Hey, check it out.
My kid did this.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.834
- You know
what really bothers me?

02:29.834 --> 02:32.083
- Besides the eight-year-old
drawing beaver shots?

02:32.083 --> 02:34.583
- You notice he wasn't
the least bit interested

02:34.583 --> 02:36.458
in our thing.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.959
- Well, I've got to say,
a set model versus kiddie porn?

02:38.959 --> 02:40.500
- No, that's not the point.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.125
If it's not about him,
he couldn't care less.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.709
- Right, he's self-involved.
He's narcissistic.

02:45.709 --> 02:46.500
He's...
[gasps]

02:46.500 --> 02:47.875
an actor.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.291
I know it's hard to remember

02:49.291 --> 02:50.792
given his work on this show.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.333
- Just so bloody one-sided.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.083
You realize he's never even
asked to read our script?

02:56.083 --> 02:57.959
Everyone in town has read it.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.500
Wouldn't you think
he'd be slightly curious?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.125
- Maybe he read it
and didn't like it.

03:02.125 --> 03:04.375
Maybe he's just trying
to spare our feelings.

03:04.375 --> 03:06.375
- Does that sound like him?
- Mm.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.083
Well, then, if he doesn't want
to read it, who cares?

03:09.083 --> 03:11.625
What, you need
his informed literary opinion?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.959
- No, it's just--

03:12.959 --> 03:15.125
- Who he is.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.458
Please let it go.

03:17.458 --> 03:21.125
Just compliment his son's vagina
and leave it at that.

03:26.792 --> 03:29.709
- So we, um--

03:29.709 --> 03:32.500
we have our first notes
on the script for the new show.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.834
- Yeah?
- Mm.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.667
It's amazing.
Virtually nothing.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.208
- Wow.

03:38.208 --> 03:42.083
- It's a little disconcerting,
all this unbridled praise.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.792
Everyone just seems to love it.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.166
- That's great.

03:45.166 --> 03:48.041
I'm thinking of getting a drone.
- A drone?

03:48.041 --> 03:49.333
- Yeah, anyone can buy them now.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.750
- What would you do
with a drone?

03:50.750 --> 03:53.041
- I don't know, drone stuff.

03:53.041 --> 03:54.834
Look at the tops of birds,

03:54.834 --> 03:56.166
see my roof,

03:56.166 --> 03:58.208
drop shit
on Burt Bacharach's house.

03:58.208 --> 04:01.000
- Why Burt Bacharach?
- It's a whole thing.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.917
But he'll know.

04:04.917 --> 04:07.333
- So you haven't by any chance
read it, have you?

04:07.333 --> 04:08.667
- What?

04:08.667 --> 04:09.917
- Our script.
- No.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.542
- Oh, good.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.875
For a second, I was afraid
you might be the one person

04:13.875 --> 04:15.875
who read it
and didn't love it.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.542
- Oh, not to worry.

04:18.542 --> 04:20.333
I could take pictures
of Suzanne Somers.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.834
- What?
- With my drone.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.375
She lives next to me.

04:23.375 --> 04:27.250
Her gardener told my gardener
that she lies out naked.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.583
I'd drone that.
- Right.

04:29.583 --> 04:32.000
[exhales]

04:32.000 --> 04:33.041
Quick question.
- Hmm?

04:33.041 --> 04:34.875
- What is wrong with you?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.500
Why don't you want to read it?
- What?

04:36.500 --> 04:39.709
- Our script.
Why don't you want to read it?

04:39.709 --> 04:41.500
- Whoa, okay, fine.
I'll read it.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.875
- Oh, no,
don't do me any favors.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.834
I don't need a mercy read.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.041
- All right.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.458
- Seriously?
You're not gonna read it?

04:49.458 --> 04:51.250
- Okay, I don't know
what you want here.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.959
- I would like, just for once,
for you to be interested

04:53.959 --> 04:56.125
in something
that's important to me.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.709
- Shouldn't we be
sleeping together

04:57.709 --> 04:58.834
to be having this conversation?

04:58.834 --> 05:00.417
- Fine.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.583
- [exhales]
Please can I read your script?

05:04.583 --> 05:05.750
- No.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.083
- You're right. I'm sorry.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.625
I'm a selfish asshole.
- Agreed.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.917
- I really want to read it.

05:11.917 --> 05:14.250
- Really?
- Yes.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.583
- All right.

05:18.583 --> 05:19.875
As long as you're not doing it

05:19.875 --> 05:21.417
just because I pressured you
into it.

05:21.417 --> 05:22.875
- Oh, well...
- What?

05:22.875 --> 05:26.417

on the Angry Men  rewrite?

05:44.417 --> 05:47.083
- I think some of them
are still too angry.

05:47.083 --> 05:50.125
- [sighs]
Is he ever gonna get there?

05:50.125 --> 05:51.875

on this thing?

she's ever gonna tell us?

- Are we absolutely sure?

she's in?

06:19.458 --> 06:20.875
- 11th? 12th?

06:20.875 --> 06:22.875

no boyfriend?

She lives alone.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.041
She just has those two cats.

- Nothing, really.

Hung out, watched TV.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.041
- Read anything?

- Actually, I'm reading
this book on tape.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.417
It's really cool.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.291
It's about how
if Hitler had won the war--

we sure dodged a bullet there.

the whole bloody weekend.

07:46.542 --> 07:47.542
- I said I'll read it.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.792
- It's 28 pages.

07:49.792 --> 07:51.667
It's not the fucking Goldfinch.

07:51.667 --> 07:54.083
- I don't know--
- It's a thick book.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.000
- Got you.
- Unbelievable.

08:00.709 --> 08:03.291
- Knock, knock.
What's up?

08:03.291 --> 08:07.375
- I believe there is something
for you on my desk.

- What is this?

08:09.583 --> 08:10.792
What did you do?

08:10.792 --> 08:12.291
- Open it.

You should not have done this.

I can't--

You're breathing.

08:38.834 --> 08:40.125
- A key?

08:40.125 --> 08:41.417
After two weeks?

08:41.417 --> 08:44.458
It's just--
it's too much too fast.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.291
Oh, did I tell you?

08:46.291 --> 08:48.625
She already invited me
to Stanford

08:48.625 --> 08:50.083
for her daughter's graduation.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.959
- Aw.
- In June.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.458
- Well, that's not so--

08:53.458 --> 08:55.959
- No, not this June.
Next June.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.500
- Oh.
- Oh, God.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.208
What is wrong with me?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.166
I should be happy.

09:03.166 --> 09:06.083
This--
it's like a dream come true,

09:06.083 --> 09:07.959
and I'm getting hives.

09:07.959 --> 09:10.166
- Oh,
that is definitely hive-y.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.500
- All right, stop looking.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.750
- Okay. Okay, listen.

09:12.750 --> 09:16.542
You have to tell her
how you feel.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.291
- Nyeh.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.458
- You can't spend an entire
relationship on antihistamines.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.709
- Wh-what am I supposed to say?

09:23.709 --> 09:25.083
"Less love, please."

09:25.083 --> 09:28.542
I--I don't want to hurt her.

09:28.542 --> 09:31.500
- You're just asking her
to slow down a bit.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.291
Look, if this relationship
has any hope of sustaining,

09:35.291 --> 09:37.750
you have got to be honest.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.166
- Okay, fine.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.625
[sighs]
You're right.

09:41.625 --> 09:42.792
I hear you.

09:42.792 --> 09:46.917
[cell phone ringing]

09:46.917 --> 09:48.250
Yeah.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.500
[stammering]

09:50.500 --> 09:52.542
Hi, sweetie.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.041
No, I'm at the dentist.

09:54.041 --> 09:56.417
I lost a crown.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.750
It's all good.
Be back soon.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.709
[whimpers]
I got to go.

10:07.291 --> 10:08.959
- You know, I'm a writer too.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.709
- Oh, no. No, I did not.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.709
- I'm working on a screenplay.

10:13.709 --> 10:15.000
- Ah.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.583
Oh, good for you.

10:19.542 --> 10:20.750
- It's about this girl.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.333
- Oh, okay.

10:22.333 --> 10:23.709
- Nobody ever notices her.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.667
No one ever asks about her life
or how she's doing.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.417
It's--it's like
she's not a person too.

10:29.417 --> 10:30.834
No one cares.
- Aw.

10:30.834 --> 10:34.792
- So she decides to kill
her coworkers.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.166
- Ah.
Did not see that coming.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.750
There's your twist.

10:40.750 --> 10:45.166
- She just feels like,
"You don't notice me?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.500
You'll notice me."

10:46.500 --> 10:49.166
- And there's your motivation.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.083
Good, you'll need that.

10:51.083 --> 10:55.375
So...
she kills them...

10:55.375 --> 10:57.333
- By poisoning them.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.583
- I see.

10:59.583 --> 11:02.250
- She does it slowly,
little by little,

11:02.250 --> 11:05.041
and no one suspects
because she's just this girl.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.500
Who is she?
She's nobody.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.625
No one would think.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.667
- Of course not.
Perfect crime.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.166
- Can I show it to you
when I'm done?

11:12.166 --> 11:14.583
- Absolutely.
Yes, I'm very interested.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.291
[chuckling]

11:23.458 --> 11:24.375
Where did you get that?

11:24.375 --> 11:26.250
- Over there.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.041
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.917
- Fucking brilliant.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.166
- You read it?

11:34.166 --> 11:36.166
- Like I had a choice.
- Interesting.

11:36.166 --> 11:41.125
- Oh, well,
I might have mentioned once or--

11:41.125 --> 11:42.667
stop looking at me.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.750
- It is so good.
- Really?

11:44.750 --> 11:46.458
- Oh, my God.
I laughed my ass off.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.041
Now I see why
everybody's flipping out.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.375
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.250
- So have you started casting?

11:51.250 --> 11:52.667
Can I put in a good word
for someone?

11:52.667 --> 11:53.834
- Absolutely. Who?

11:53.834 --> 11:55.041
- Me.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.542
- I'm sorry?
- Say what?

11:58.542 --> 12:01.875
- I would love to do this.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.834
- Great.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.917
- Yes, great.

12:09.917 --> 12:13.750
What, um--
what part were you thinking?

12:13.750 --> 12:15.417
- Well, got to be Anderson.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.333
It's like you wrote it for me.

12:17.333 --> 12:20.041
- Not really.
[chuckling]

12:20.041 --> 12:23.625
Y-you should know
that the actor playing Anderson

12:23.625 --> 12:27.625
also has to play Riggs,
so that's maybe more than you--

12:27.625 --> 12:29.417
- Holy shit, I love Riggs.
- Oh.

12:29.417 --> 12:31.583
- That's my second favorite.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.041
So I'm Anderson and Riggs?

12:34.041 --> 12:36.875
- Apparently so.
- Wow.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.458
I got to tell you,
I was so scared

12:39.458 --> 12:42.250
I'd get stuck taking
some shit show for the check,

12:42.250 --> 12:44.041
but this?

12:44.041 --> 12:46.250
And with you guys?

12:46.250 --> 12:48.834
I--I don't know what to say.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.792
- I think we're all at a loss.
[both chuckle]

12:51.792 --> 12:53.834
- All right.
I got to call my agent.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.709
Let's get this thing going.
Whoo-hoo!

12:55.709 --> 12:57.542
- Whoo-hoo.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.542
Why did you say "great"?

13:02.542 --> 13:04.959
- Well, you said "great."
- Only because you said it.

13:04.959 --> 13:07.458
If I don't say "great"
after you say "great,"

13:07.458 --> 13:09.041
suddenly I'm the bad guy.

13:09.041 --> 13:11.458
And may I just point out--
not in a judgmental way--

13:11.458 --> 13:13.083
none of this would have happened

13:13.083 --> 13:15.500
if you hadn't forced him
to read the bloody thing.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.166
This is all of your making.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.542
- We don't want him in it,
do we?

13:18.542 --> 13:20.333
- You're really asking me that?
No.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.750
Do you?
- No, he's dead wrong.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.750
But he's so excited.
- I know.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.625
But we have been down
the Matt LeBlanc road.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.458
It is bumpy,
and it ends in a cliff.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.500
- So...
- I don't know.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.917
But we have to do something.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.417
This train is moving.

13:32.417 --> 13:33.959
- Hey, what are you guys
doing later?

13:33.959 --> 13:36.083
- Um...nothing.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.917
- Come to the beach.
I'll throw some steaks on.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.417
We'll celebrate this thing.
- Great.

13:39.417 --> 13:42.000
- Cool.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.709
- Who said "great" that time?
- Yeah, I know.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.625
- And you notice
we didn't stop the train.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.959
- No.
We added a dining car.

13:50.417 --> 13:53.959
[keys clacking]

13:55.792 --> 13:57.834
- Are you a dog person?

13:57.834 --> 13:59.667
- Why? What did you order?

13:59.667 --> 14:02.208
- [laughs]
I don't know.

14:02.208 --> 14:06.625
I was just thinking, you know,
maybe we should get a dog.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.792
- Huh.
- Oh, not a fan?

14:08.792 --> 14:12.375
- Uh, no,
I just never had one.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.125
My mother was allergic.

14:14.125 --> 14:16.166
We had a bird, Louise.

14:16.166 --> 14:18.000
My sister taught her to say...

14:18.000 --> 14:19.792
[imitating parrot]
"We're gonna crash.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.458
We're gonna crash."
- Oh, my God.

14:21.458 --> 14:24.417
- Yeah.
It was pretty tense at home.

14:24.417 --> 14:25.625
- I'll bet.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.583
So dog or no dog?

14:28.583 --> 14:32.500
- Well, how would it work?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.458
Where would it live?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.041
- Here.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.500
With us.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.041
- Oh.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.583
- Hello?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.250
- Out here.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.834
- [sighs]

14:47.834 --> 14:50.000
So dreading this.
- Has to be done.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.333
- Right.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.250
- Smile.
Too many teeth.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.166
- All right.

14:57.917 --> 15:00.000
- I forgot
how beautiful this is.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.917
[laughs]

15:01.917 --> 15:05.625
- When were you here?

15:05.625 --> 15:08.458
- I'll wait.

15:08.458 --> 15:11.041
- Yes, we--right.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.750
And then you came over,
and we...

15:13.750 --> 15:16.750
[chuckles]
Welcome back.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.792
How about some wine?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.208
- Gallons.
- Yes, please.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.625
- [laughs]

15:20.625 --> 15:21.709
- All right, we got steaks.

15:21.709 --> 15:24.625
There's corn, potatoes.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.291
My mom made her famous tiramisu.

15:27.291 --> 15:30.166
- Your--your mother's here?
- Yeah.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.875
She came out last week when
she heard my father might die.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.291
She wanted a ringside seat.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.291
Ma!

15:37.291 --> 15:39.166
Ma!

15:39.166 --> 15:41.667
She hates wearing
her hearing aids.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.875
[shouting loudly]
Ma!

15:42.875 --> 15:44.667
Eh, that's okay.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.542
She'll come out when
she smells the meat cooking.

15:47.542 --> 15:50.750
So here's to
The Opposite of Us.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.375
Here's hoping
it's the opposite of Pucks!

15:53.375 --> 15:55.125
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, absolutely.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.750
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

16:00.166 --> 16:02.750
- I'm gonna get the steaks.
I'll be right back.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.250
- His mother's here.
- Fuck.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.667
- We can't tell him
in front of her.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.208
- We can't not tell him.
- I know.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.583
- Oh, great, so now
his mother's on the train.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.417
- I mean,
you're here all the time anyway.

16:19.417 --> 16:21.000
- Mm-hmm.
- You could rent your place out.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.500
Make a few bucks.
- Mm-hmm.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.458
- It just makes sense, you know?
- Mm.

16:24.458 --> 16:25.417
- And I know
what you're thinking.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.875
- You do?

16:26.875 --> 16:28.250
- Everything here
is me, me, me, me.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.458
There's no you.

16:29.458 --> 16:31.917
So what I was thinking was,

16:31.917 --> 16:34.000
we get rid of all of my shit

16:34.000 --> 16:36.166
and redo the whole thing
together.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.375
- [laughing]
What?

16:38.375 --> 16:40.125
[gasps]
That's crazy.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.625
- No, it's not.
Not if you're gonna live here.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.500
Or...
- Or?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.000
- We buy a whole new place.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.291
- [laughing nervously]

16:46.291 --> 16:48.083
- Oh, what about the beach?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.125
Oh, imagine the two of us
coming home from work,

16:50.125 --> 16:52.375
and there's the ocean,
there's the sunset,

16:52.375 --> 16:53.959
and our puppy's waiting for us!

16:53.959 --> 16:56.333
- We're gonna crash.
[coughs]

16:56.333 --> 16:58.625
- What?
- Oh.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.625
I can't do this.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.792
I can't.
I'm sorry.

17:02.792 --> 17:05.959
It's--it's just--
it's too much.

17:05.959 --> 17:09.458
- What's too much?
- All of it.

17:09.458 --> 17:15.417
I mean, you're the best,
most wonderful person ever.

17:15.417 --> 17:17.417
But don't you think
it's all happening

17:17.417 --> 17:20.166
just a little too fast?

17:20.166 --> 17:22.458
Just a--
[squeaks]

17:22.458 --> 17:24.208
- Oh.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.542
Okay.

17:28.375 --> 17:31.417
- I'm sorry.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.667
- Oh, no.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.166
Don't apologize.
My fault.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.166
I just assumed
that you were where I was.

17:36.166 --> 17:40.834
- No, no, I am where you are.

17:40.834 --> 17:45.834
Just, uh, behind you a ways.

17:45.834 --> 17:48.417
Here I am.
[laughs]

17:48.417 --> 17:50.333
[groans]
I shouldn't have said anything.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.166
- No, I'm glad you did.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.667
I'd be stuck out at the fucking
beach with some stupid dog.

17:55.667 --> 17:58.208
- Uh, I think it's just--

17:58.208 --> 18:01.291
this whole thing
is very new for me.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.917
I mean,
every other guy I've been with--

18:03.917 --> 18:06.875
I'm not saying you're a guy.

18:06.875 --> 18:07.959
- Mm, thanks.

18:07.959 --> 18:09.625
- It's just--it's--

18:09.625 --> 18:12.709
it's so different
than anything I've ever--

18:12.709 --> 18:15.500
and I don't mean that way.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.542
Believe me,
I'm loving all that stuff.

18:18.542 --> 18:20.583
Oh, no, wait.

18:20.583 --> 18:25.375
Look, you know I have only
gone out with assholes.

18:25.375 --> 18:28.542
You were married to one of them.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.834
I'm not used to nice.

18:31.834 --> 18:36.000
I think I'm just scared

18:36.000 --> 18:40.208
by how much I care about you.

18:40.208 --> 18:45.166
- Well, I certainly
didn't mean to scare you.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.667
- I know.
[chuckles]

18:47.667 --> 18:50.208
And I'm sorry I got a little...
[babbles]

18:50.208 --> 18:51.917
[both laugh]

18:51.917 --> 18:53.959
- Come here, Scrunch.
both: Oh.

18:53.959 --> 18:56.709
- [laughs]
- Mm.

18:56.709 --> 18:59.917
- Oh, I wasn't even gonna
say anything.

18:59.917 --> 19:01.834
But then Beverly said--

19:01.834 --> 19:03.250
- Beverly?

19:03.250 --> 19:08.917
Oh, Beverly's giving you advice
about us?

19:08.917 --> 19:11.250
- Maybe.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.166
Why?

19:13.166 --> 19:15.417
- Well, I mean,
I know she's your friend,

19:15.417 --> 19:19.083
but I'm not sure she has
our best interests at heart.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.417
- No?

19:20.417 --> 19:21.959
- Well, for one,

19:21.959 --> 19:23.917
she's clearly in love with you.

19:23.917 --> 19:26.792
- [laughing]
B-Beverly?

19:26.792 --> 19:28.333
Oh, that's crazy.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.625
She doesn't even like me
most of the time.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.125
- Oh, okay.

19:32.125 --> 19:36.458
- No, she's not into--
she's married.

19:36.458 --> 19:37.959
- I was married.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.291
- Even so, I don't think--

19:40.291 --> 19:42.333
- Oh, please.
Look at her hair.

19:44.458 --> 19:48.041
[keys clacking]

19:48.041 --> 19:49.583
- So what do you think of this?

19:49.583 --> 19:53.875
When I'm Riggs,
I've got, like, a beard,

19:53.875 --> 19:56.417
but when I'm Anderson,
maybe,

19:56.417 --> 19:59.625
like, a weird wig
or even a bald cap or--

19:59.625 --> 20:03.125
is that too much?

20:03.125 --> 20:05.125
- I'll tell you
what's too much--this steak.

20:05.125 --> 20:07.750
Oh, my God,
you're, like, a steak savant.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.500
[both chuckle]

20:09.500 --> 20:11.583
- Not a lot to it,
just meat and fire.

20:11.583 --> 20:12.792
[chuckles]

20:12.792 --> 20:15.291
So what do you think?
Bald cap or--

20:15.291 --> 20:16.667
- It's a little too soon to--

20:16.667 --> 20:18.291
- No, I know, it's just--

20:18.291 --> 20:19.500
I can't stop thinking about it.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.750
- Oh, believe me,
neither can we.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.166
- So you guys still thinking
about Susan Sarandon?

20:24.166 --> 20:26.709
'Cause I got to say,
I could totally see that now.

20:26.709 --> 20:27.834
- [sighs]

20:27.834 --> 20:29.208
You know...
[chuckles]

20:29.208 --> 20:32.166
We don't need to
bore your mother with work talk.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.959
- She can't hear anything.

20:34.959 --> 20:39.333
Ma, look out, Koreans!

20:39.333 --> 20:41.083
Believe me,
if she could hear...

20:41.083 --> 20:42.709
[all chuckle]

20:42.709 --> 20:44.875
So Susan Sarandon?

20:44.875 --> 20:46.792
- Where?

20:46.792 --> 20:49.166
- That she heard.

20:49.166 --> 20:52.667
- Well...
[clears throat]

20:52.667 --> 20:54.625
Here's the thing.

20:54.625 --> 20:58.041
[sighs]

20:58.041 --> 21:02.834
The network is adamant
about not going with "names."

21:02.834 --> 21:04.792
- Oh.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.333
Sorry, Susan.
[chuckles]

21:07.333 --> 21:09.417
So what then,
just me and an ensemble?

21:09.417 --> 21:16.250
- I'm afraid they are dead set
against any names at all.

21:17.417 --> 21:18.583
- Wait, even me?

21:18.583 --> 21:20.375
- Across the board.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.417
- Even me?

21:22.417 --> 21:26.375
- We think it's a huge mistake,
but what can you do?

21:26.375 --> 21:27.375
- Fight it.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.834
That's what you can do.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.208
It's your show.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.125
You should have a say
in who's in it.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.709
Don't just roll over.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.250
That's how you got screwed
the last time.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.375
- Mm.
- Oh, believe me.

21:37.375 --> 21:40.166
We did not just roll over.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.000
We fought very hard for you.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.750
- Very, very hard.

21:44.750 --> 21:48.000
- Who's dead?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.250
- So who's this coming from?

21:50.250 --> 21:52.041
What's her name?
The new Merc?

21:52.041 --> 21:53.834
- Helen, yeah.
- Mm.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.583
- What if I sat down with her?
Is she cute?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.417
Maybe there's a card
to play there.

21:58.417 --> 22:01.583
- Trust me, you are never
gonna crack that deck,

22:01.583 --> 22:03.000
not even to shuffle.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.917
- No?
- Many queens.

22:04.917 --> 22:08.083
Not so much
with the kings and jacks.

22:08.083 --> 22:10.458
- Got it.
All right, forget that.

22:10.458 --> 22:11.458
Let's just call her.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.208
- Uh, what? What?

22:13.208 --> 22:15.291
- Yeah, maybe the three of us
can turn her around.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.291
- Oh, I'm sure
she's already left the office.

22:17.291 --> 22:19.208
- So we'll just call her
at home.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.291
- What?
Easy, Pinot Noir.

22:21.291 --> 22:24.375
You can't just call her at home.
- Why not?

22:24.375 --> 22:28.625
I'm sure my agent's got
her number.

22:28.625 --> 22:30.083
You know,
these guys actually like it

22:30.083 --> 22:31.500
when you treat them like people.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.125
- But they're not.
I agree with Sean.

22:34.125 --> 22:37.000
It would be a big mistake
to bother--

22:37.000 --> 22:38.166
- Hey, it's Matt.

22:38.166 --> 22:41.208
Do you have Helen...
- Basch.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.917
- Basch's home phone?
I'm here with Sean and Beverly.

22:43.917 --> 22:47.792
She told them she doesn't
want me in their show.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.792
Really?

22:49.792 --> 22:51.875
Hang on.

22:51.875 --> 22:53.291
He's saying he spoke to her
just to see

22:53.291 --> 22:55.083
what kind of money
they're thinking,

22:55.083 --> 22:58.291
and she didn't even know
you'd offered it to me.

22:58.291 --> 23:01.583
- Well, maybe...
- [exhales]

23:03.333 --> 23:08.709
- He spoke to her
before she spoke with us.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.333
- You hear that?

23:13.458 --> 23:15.291
He's saying he talked to her,
like, an hour ago.

23:15.291 --> 23:16.834
You were here an hour ago.
- Well...

23:16.834 --> 23:18.709
- There must be
some logical explanation.

23:18.709 --> 23:20.250
- I don't know
what she could be thinking.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.792
It could be some kind...

23:21.792 --> 23:23.583
- We can get into it
with her

23:23.583 --> 23:24.875
in the morning.
- Of sinister network ploy.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.333
- Y-yeah.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.458
- I'll call you back.

23:32.458 --> 23:33.542
[phone beeps]

23:36.500 --> 23:38.750
Did you talk to her or not?

23:50.875 --> 23:52.250
Huh.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.041
- This is too rare for me.

23:54.041 --> 23:58.208
It looks like
it was in a car accident.

23:58.208 --> 23:59.792
I think she's got mine.

23:59.792 --> 24:01.500
- Oh, my God.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.834
Please, here, take it.

24:02.834 --> 24:04.709
[clears throat]

24:04.709 --> 24:05.959
- Yeah, see?

24:05.959 --> 24:07.375
This one is cooked.

24:07.375 --> 24:10.375
- Yes, it is.

24:15.291 --> 24:18.250
- Do you want me in your show?

24:18.250 --> 24:20.750
- We know she'll never go
for it.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.125
- That's not what I asked.

24:23.125 --> 24:26.166
Do you...

24:26.166 --> 24:28.792
want me in your show?

24:39.667 --> 24:42.792
Then why'd you make me
read the fucking thing?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.834
- Clearly I should not have.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.875
- We're both so sorry.

24:54.875 --> 24:58.917
- [hacking]

24:58.917 --> 25:01.500
[spits]

25:03.041 --> 25:04.959
Gristle.

25:04.959 --> 25:07.291
- Yes, it is.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.125
- Perhaps it would be best
if we left.

25:16.125 --> 25:17.125
[clears throat]

25:17.125 --> 25:18.125
- Where are they going?

25:18.125 --> 25:19.625
Where are you going?

25:19.625 --> 25:22.959
- Um, I'm afraid we have to run,
Mrs. LeBlanc.

25:22.959 --> 25:25.333
- What?
- We have to leave now.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.125
- It was so lovely--

25:27.125 --> 25:29.959
- Wait, wait.

25:44.333 --> 25:47.166
- If you could just tell
your mother good night for us.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.417
- Tiramisu.

25:48.417 --> 25:50.333
- Oh, no, that's very kind,

25:50.333 --> 25:51.667
but I'm afraid
we really have to--

25:51.667 --> 25:52.834
- I made it.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.458
- No, no, I-I know you did,
but--

25:54.458 --> 25:56.000
- It looks delicious,
but we really must--

25:56.000 --> 25:57.333
- Enjoy.

26:11.458 --> 26:12.417
- Mmm, it's brilliant.

26:12.417 --> 26:15.750
- Mmm, this is such a treat.

26:23.917 --> 26:28.750
- We will remember this forever.
- Mm.

26:35.792 --> 26:38.333
Well, that was glorious.
- More?

26:38.333 --> 26:39.667
- No. No, thank you.
- No, no. No, no.

26:39.667 --> 26:40.875
Um...
[clears throat]

26:40.875 --> 26:43.291
All right then, so, uh...

26:43.291 --> 26:45.750
we--we're off.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.333
Um...

26:49.333 --> 26:53.583
again,
we could not regret this more.

26:59.542 --> 27:00.583
- We'll see you tomorrow.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.291
- So sorry.

27:07.917 --> 27:11.250
- Very sorry.
- So poorly handled.

27:15.709 --> 27:17.250
- Thank you for having us.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.291
We must do this again.
- What is wrong with you?

27:23.291 --> 27:24.834
- I don't know.

27:31.959 --> 27:33.166
- They seem nice.
