00:29.797 --> 00:32.533
<i>We are beginning our</i>
final descent into Themyscira.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.234

00:35.234 --> 00:37.204
<i>A friendly reminder that</i>
<i>any man who dares</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:39.206

00:39.206 --> 00:41.441
-[Harley] Ah!
-[pilot] <i>Enjoy your visit.</i>

00:41.508 --> 00:43.243
Here's your crown,
here's your sash.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.445
Here's a reusable penis straw
made of recycled metals,

00:45.445 --> 00:47.179
and its cleaning wand
and a carrying pouch.

00:47.179 --> 00:49.649
Look at you, makin' your list,
checkin' it twice.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.652
You only get
bachelorette weekend-ed once!

00:52.719 --> 00:54.353
I'm gonna check on
the other girls.

00:56.622 --> 00:58.725
Mrs. Freeze in da house!

00:58.792 --> 01:00.627
You ready for the best weekend
of your life?

01:00.694 --> 01:02.529
Don't waste your breath.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.231
I know I'm just a pity invite
because you killed my husband.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.500
Technically he killed himself.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.867
But you still came.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.135
That means you're open
to having a good time.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.704
Well, not really.

01:11.704 --> 01:14.140
But I've never been
to an all-female island before.

01:14.206 --> 01:16.475
Seems like it'll be great
for crying.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.578
Hey, Jen!

01:17.644 --> 01:19.212
[chuckles] It's Jennifer.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.248
Ah, so glad you could
make it from Michigan.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.882
Must be hard
leaving your four kids.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.284
Would've been easier
if I was the maid of honor.

01:25.284 --> 01:27.254
You know, Ivy and I
went to kindergarten together

01:27.254 --> 01:29.355
and we always said we'd
be each other's maids of honor.

01:29.355 --> 01:30.757
-[chuckles]
-So cool.

01:30.823 --> 01:32.325
So special. [gasps]

01:32.391 --> 01:33.826
Wow, gross,
that must happen a lot.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.394
[gasps]

01:35.462 --> 01:36.697
[Jennifer] Ah.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.731
-This is free, right?
-Yep, cheers.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.436
Ugh. Why did I

01:42.436 --> 01:44.170
pay for first class
if you're just gonna

01:44.170 --> 01:45.805
-burst in here.
-The curtain's invisible.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.540
I'm just makin' sure you have
everything you need.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.308
Can I show you how to wash
your reusable straw?

01:49.308 --> 01:51.644
You have two minutes
until my Ambien kicks in.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.179
But we're about to land.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.548
Mmm-hmm, I'm trying
to catnap through

01:54.548 --> 01:56.248
as much of this weekend
as possible.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.487
Everyone's ready to party!
[whooping]

02:01.555 --> 02:03.590
I'm so excited for you
to marry Kite Man.

02:03.599 --> 02:05.626
Me, too. I mean,
I love him, you know.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.260
And I love him!

02:07.260 --> 02:09.763
Ugh! I mean, if you
didn't marry Kite Man, I would!

02:09.763 --> 02:11.731
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, 1,000%.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.699
I'm gonna set you up
for the best marriage ever

02:13.699 --> 02:15.002
by making
your bachelorette party

02:15.002 --> 02:17.002
the best weekend of your life!

02:19.907 --> 02:21.507
-[Harley sniffs]
-[Poison Ivy clears throat]

02:24.443 --> 02:27.593
[theme music playing]

02:33.954 --> 02:35.421
[Poison Ivy] Wow. This is

02:35.421 --> 02:37.223
the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

02:37.289 --> 02:39.759
Themyscira Resort works with
the natural landscape.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.894
It's so you.

02:43.295 --> 02:44.531
Okay! We're here.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.348
Everyone out of
the invisible van!

02:49.703 --> 02:50.837
[yawns]

02:53.639 --> 02:56.408
Harley! I'm Eris,
the resort manager.

02:56.408 --> 02:57.877
We spoke on the phone.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.514
I hope you ladies are ready
for the VIP treatment.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.550
This all feels like
oddly corporate

03:03.550 --> 03:04.884
for the Amazons.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.353
I mean,
they don't seem like the type

03:06.353 --> 03:08.420
to offer soap concierge.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.456
Oh, Svetlana knows her suds.

03:10.456 --> 03:13.894
The economy has been booming
since Wonder Woman disappeared,

03:13.894 --> 03:15.228
and Queen Hippolyta
brought me on

03:15.294 --> 03:17.497
to keep that momentum going.

03:17.563 --> 03:20.300
Hope and Mercy here
will escort you to your suites.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.902
Take lots of pics
and don't forget to tag us.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.973
Itineraries are in your rooms.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.408
Everyone meet in the lobby
in 20 for our spa treatments.

03:29.408 --> 03:31.444
I have never seen you
with a clipboard.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.046
I mean, I'm...
I'm like impressed with it,

03:33.046 --> 03:34.500
but it's also
kinda freaking me out.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.584
It's all for you,
Poison Bridey. [chuckles]

03:37.651 --> 03:39.986
How excited are you to party
with all your besties?

03:39.986 --> 03:42.923
Uh, look, I know this isn't
like a friend group

03:42.990 --> 03:45.358
so much as, like, a disparate
collection of strange women

03:45.358 --> 03:46.627
I glommed on to during the most

03:46.627 --> 03:48.027
difficult stages
of my life, so...

03:48.094 --> 03:49.830
You deserve a fun girls' trip.

03:49.896 --> 03:50.900
And so do they.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.532
I already took the safe out
of Catwoman's room,

03:52.532 --> 03:54.300
I had Mrs. Freeze's AC
turned way up,

03:54.300 --> 03:55.836
and I know Jen
doesn't like fish, so--

03:55.836 --> 03:57.403
I said don't call me Jen.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.472
[Jennifer chuckles]

03:58.538 --> 04:00.306
Harley, you have obviously put

04:00.306 --> 04:01.775
a lot of planning
into this trip,

04:01.842 --> 04:03.342
which just doesn't seem
like you.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.844
Is everything okay?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.612
Of course it is.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.782
I'm the maid of honor
to the hottest bride on Earth.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.584
Thanks. For everything.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.953
[sighs]

04:12.953 --> 04:14.087
I'm truly embarrassed for you.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.455
-What?
-This whole

04:15.455 --> 04:17.091
sweaty maid of honor routine,

04:17.091 --> 04:19.399
too many thoughtful details.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.459
You two hooked up.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.997
What? No! Me? Her? No, never.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.898
Stop denying it.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.767
[groans] Fine, yes!
We kissed. Okay?

04:27.834 --> 04:29.903
[sighs] Feels so great
to say that out loud.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.737
It's really been
weighing on me.

04:31.737 --> 04:33.507
Thanks for saying something.
I really need a confidante.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.408
I am not here to support you.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.976
I do not want
to talk about this again.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.444
Sure, sure,
I may have feelings,

04:38.444 --> 04:39.913
but I'm not gonna act on them.
I mean,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.447
neither of us wants that.
They'll fade over time.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.716
That's what feelings are
known for doing.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.050
Neither of us wants that!

04:44.050 --> 04:45.951
Why don't you say it
one more time to be sure?

04:48.487 --> 04:51.557
[Clayface] Oh! I have almost
finished the border.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.660
Hey! That's part of
the other cloud.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.062
Do not force puzzle pieces.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.629
Look at the cover
of the fucking box.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.598
King, what are you
doing in the cabin?

04:59.665 --> 05:02.802
I thought the open sea
was your home.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.603
It was my home,

05:04.603 --> 05:07.339
but I left for
unspecified reasons,

05:07.339 --> 05:08.641
the origins of which

05:08.641 --> 05:10.877
I choose not to get into
right now.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.447
Well, hey,
this is a bachelor party.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.115
The Wi-Fi's a little slow,

05:16.182 --> 05:19.586
but I think I have some tunes
downloaded on my phone here.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.954
No.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.523
Just the score
to <i>Big Momma's House 2.</i>

05:23.589 --> 05:24.858
Heavens to Betsy.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.494
A rogue lobster
just scuttled aboard.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.129
[yelps] Oh, no!

05:29.196 --> 05:31.497
Oh, no, no, no!
I'm not ready for this.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.600
Nanaue! I have searched
the seven seas for you.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.036
No! No, no, no!

05:36.103 --> 05:37.904
It's a talking lobster.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.507
Have you ever seen anything
as crazy as a lobster talking?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.009
Who is this Nanaue?

05:42.076 --> 05:44.577
King, you okay?
Do you owe this lobster money?

05:44.644 --> 05:46.779
[King Shark]
I wish that's all I owed him.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.548
I told you guys I didn't want
to leave the marina.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.617
[Samson] I and I been looking
for you for months.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.519
Your father needs you.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.889
The Hammerheads,
they won't sign the trade deal.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.759
If the Federation crumbles,
it will start a war.

05:58.824 --> 06:00.793
You must come home
and marry Tabitha,

06:00.860 --> 06:03.730
for the safety and livelihood
of your entire kingdom.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.997
What about what I want?

06:05.064 --> 06:06.399
What are you saying?

06:06.466 --> 06:07.899
You are Nanaue.

06:07.899 --> 06:10.036
Is this an elaborate prelude
to mermaid strippers?

06:10.103 --> 06:11.670
I said
I did not want strippers.

06:11.737 --> 06:13.040
No. [groans]

06:13.107 --> 06:15.641
My father is king
of the Shark Kingdom

06:15.709 --> 06:17.610
and I was heir to the throne,

06:17.677 --> 06:20.512
but I didn't want
an arranged marriage.

06:20.579 --> 06:21.781
So I ran.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.951
And now it's time
for you to shark up.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.019
-Come, quickly!
-He's with us now.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.588
So you can go
back to Shark Kingdom.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.557
[Clayface gasps and groans]

06:31.625 --> 06:33.826
You should listen
to the lobster.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.461
I'll come with you, Samson,

06:35.528 --> 06:38.430
but only to tell off my father
once and for all.

06:38.497 --> 06:40.466
Don't finish the puzzle
without me, guys.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.869
It would be a betrayal.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.839
That was weird.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.742
How was your snorkeling lesson,
Mrs. Freeze?

06:49.810 --> 06:50.944
[Mrs. Freeze] I'm starving.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.278
When's our table gonna
be ready?

06:52.278 --> 06:54.214
Ugh. These patio heaters
don't work.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.550
Ugh. Small talk
makes me claustrophobic.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.617
Tell Ivy
I said happy-- [screeches]

06:58.685 --> 07:00.553
[Harley] Listen up,
you picky bitches!

07:00.553 --> 07:02.223
This weekend isn't about
what you want to do

07:02.223 --> 07:03.622
or not do!

07:03.622 --> 07:05.125
Get off it, Harley.
You suck at this.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.994
Fuck you, Jennifer!

07:06.997 --> 07:08.728
This is about
having the time of our lives

07:08.795 --> 07:10.764
to prove to Ivy
that we are excited

07:10.764 --> 07:12.531
-for her marriage!
-[Jennifer groaning]

07:12.598 --> 07:15.569
So, when our bride comes back
from changing her tampon,

07:15.634 --> 07:17.004
you better participate,

07:17.004 --> 07:19.139
you better smile,
and you better start drinking

07:19.206 --> 07:21.040
like your life depends on it!

07:21.108 --> 07:23.944
-I don't drink.
-I don't care!

07:24.011 --> 07:26.947
This vegan golden apple pate
is divine.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.548
[woodenly] I don't
miss the meat.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.216
Me too, totally the best.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.920
I haven't even thought about
my dead husband once.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.788
Only my happiness for Ivy.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.889
Yay. Cheers to Ivy.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.129
And to Harley,

07:38.129 --> 07:40.026
for making this whole
weekend possible, I guess.

07:40.026 --> 07:43.230
To having fun
on our girls' trip.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.665
Wow. Every one
of my awful friends
are having fun.

07:46.665 --> 07:48.101
You have done the impossible.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.103
Oh, can you toast again
for the camera?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.072
I want to post it
to our sosh meed.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.040
Really? I thought
this whole thing
was like a secret island.

07:54.108 --> 07:55.211
Oh, it was.

07:55.211 --> 07:57.677
But now it will be
a premier resort destination

07:57.677 --> 07:59.178
for A-Listers only.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.646
Hadids and above.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.048
Right, right.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.050
And, Your Majesty,
how do you feel about that?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.853
I am very onboard with this.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.055
Um, what the fuck is wrong with
the Queen?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.589
Meh! Cultures change.

08:10.589 --> 08:11.992
Who wants to
look at a dessert menu?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.699
Is there anything
to do around here

08:13.699 --> 08:15.262
besides relax?

08:15.300 --> 08:16.471
Oh, of course.

08:16.471 --> 08:19.098
There's a restorative
waterfall, a wilderness hike,

08:19.165 --> 08:21.168
and just a ferry ride away

08:21.168 --> 08:23.803
there's a tiny island
called Hedonikka.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.939
-It has men and they--
-We're doing that.

08:27.141 --> 08:29.910
Look, I'm only here
to tell my dad no.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.812
And maybe pick up some lunch.

08:31.877 --> 08:34.914
Nanaue, I've known you
since the day you was born

08:34.981 --> 08:36.649
in the bosom of the ocean.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.441
[yells]

17:22.576 --> 17:24.826
[both grunting]

17:34.221 --> 17:35.823
[groans] You hit me in the tit.

17:35.890 --> 17:39.259
Sign here, date here.
It's the 16th.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.827
-[Jennifer grunts]
-[screams]

17:42.730 --> 17:44.463
<i>Eris, get the contract!</i>

17:46.232 --> 17:48.101
[Harley grunts]

17:48.101 --> 17:50.303
<i>Harley on your right!</i>
<i>No, no, your other right!</i>

17:50.304 --> 17:51.337
<i>My right!</i>

17:51.404 --> 17:52.772
How do I close this window?

17:52.839 --> 17:55.642
Ah! It's in full-screen mode.
Shit. [groans]

17:55.709 --> 17:58.711
Which HDMI port did you use?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.847
-[Harley grunts]
-[Jennifer panting]

18:00.914 --> 18:03.450
-[Jennifer grunts]
-[Eris groans]

18:03.517 --> 18:06.252
This is for selling out nature
and women and--

18:06.318 --> 18:08.387
Not having bottomless mimosas.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.656
[pants]

18:13.527 --> 18:14.560
What happened?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.296
You were possessed by Eris.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.498
She turned
your island into a resort.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.267
This is Themyscira?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.536
Yeah. And Harley Quinn
saved the day.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.637
With the rest of
the Cobb Squad.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.172
Very well.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.307
We shall celebrate
the Cobb Squad's victory

18:28.375 --> 18:30.644
in the ancient tradition
of the Amazons.

18:30.711 --> 18:32.144
We're gonna
have a fucking rager?

18:32.211 --> 18:35.248
We're going to
have a fucking rager.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.517
-[women cheering]
-[Jennifer whooping]

18:38.250 --> 18:40.753
[both groan]

18:40.820 --> 18:42.200
Are you having fun?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.290
I'm just glad you talked me
into coming back out.

18:44.356 --> 18:47.326
You know, it's like,
aside from the horrible mistake

18:47.394 --> 18:50.463
that we made earlier, this has
been my dream vacation.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.866
I mean, relaxation,
partying, murder.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.234
I mean, man,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.202
you know me better than anyone.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.571
You're easy to celebrate.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.907
And you're
fun to celebrate with.

19:02.643 --> 19:03.992
[snoring]

19:08.381 --> 19:10.349
-Oh, shit, fuck!
-Oh, double fuck.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.618
Oh, for the ding of fuck nuts!

19:12.685 --> 19:14.755
I can't-- What is wro--

19:14.821 --> 19:16.455
How can I fuckin'--

19:16.522 --> 19:18.692
Oh, my God.
We have talked about this.

19:18.759 --> 19:20.693
We cannot do this again.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.729
We just said that
we weren't gonna do it
and then we did it again.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.830
You're right.
You're totally right.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.632
We can't do this. We can't--

19:25.699 --> 19:27.567
Wait, why can't we do this?

19:27.567 --> 19:28.969
Because you're my best friend,

19:29.036 --> 19:31.337
and I can't stand
the idea of losing you.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.640
-You know? I--
-You don't have to.

19:33.707 --> 19:35.575
We'd be closer
than we've ever been before.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.309
Well, not closer
than last night,

19:37.309 --> 19:39.278
-I mean, that was crazy.
-Yeah, that was fucking crazy.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.280
Don't you want to feel this way
all the time?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.950
Our whole lives could be
going around the world

19:42.950 --> 19:45.786
saving nature,
freeing all-female armies,

19:45.853 --> 19:47.921
partying, getting free stuff.

19:47.988 --> 19:49.455
It would be so fun!

19:49.957 --> 19:50.957
I love you.

19:51.959 --> 19:55.858
Just think about it, okay?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.500
[Clayface] Ooh,
one hour till we dock.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.836
I bet we can finish the puzzle.

20:02.903 --> 20:04.438
-Hey!
-No one touches another piece

20:04.503 --> 20:06.440
until King Shark gets back!

20:06.440 --> 20:07.473
Nobody. I mean it!

20:07.473 --> 20:08.875
I can't wait to see Ivy.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.778
Ah, I wonder what she'll
complain about first.

20:10.778 --> 20:12.813
Probably the airplane food.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.281
God, she is one in a million.

20:15.347 --> 20:18.317
Wow. You certainly share
a unique connection.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.420
[King Shark roars]

20:20.487 --> 20:23.256
The King hath returned!

20:23.323 --> 20:25.291
So you stood up to your dad?
That rules.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.426
I looked him right in the eye
and I said,

20:27.493 --> 20:30.696
"Daddy, I'm not
marrying Tabitha."

20:30.763 --> 20:31.932
Good for you.

20:31.999 --> 20:34.701
A man is nothing
without his convictions.

20:34.768 --> 20:36.002
Exactly.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.938
And then,
a couple minutes after that

20:38.005 --> 20:39.772
I came back and got married.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.342
What? I can't say no
to King Daddy.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.511
But at least now he knows
I'm not happy about it.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.650
Wait. You got married
to someone you just met?

20:49.715 --> 20:51.919
She didn't reject you
over and over?

20:51.919 --> 20:53.519
How many times did you propose?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.521
I think... none?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.457
-What?
-Tabitha and I worked it out.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.026
We'll stay married publicly,

20:59.093 --> 21:01.627
but we're each allowed
to have secret relationships.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.530
I mean, sure,
we could probably get along

21:04.597 --> 21:06.298
and have a very
milquetoast marriage,

21:06.365 --> 21:08.401
but I don't want that.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.403
I wanna be with
someone who excites me.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.939
Where love isn't safe,

21:11.939 --> 21:14.740
the kind of love that
doesn't have limits.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.308
I want a soulmate.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.544
Just like me and Ivy.

21:17.611 --> 21:18.612
[Clayface] Mmm.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.948
[Harley] Bye!

21:21.015 --> 21:23.083
Jennifer! Welcome home, honey.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.684
[shushes] Stop.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.653
I'm going by Jen now, okay?

21:26.720 --> 21:27.721
Okay. [stammers] What...

21:27.788 --> 21:29.056
What happened on that trip?

21:29.123 --> 21:31.858
[Mrs. Freeze] I can't wait
to get you home.

21:31.858 --> 21:32.893
[chuckles]

21:32.960 --> 21:34.728
Ooh! Stop.

21:34.795 --> 21:37.299
[car squeaking]

21:37.396 --> 21:39.365
[exhales] Okay, I've
thought about what you said.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.567
And this weekend was
so special.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.603
Amazing, really.

21:43.670 --> 21:47.374
And you're right,
that we have had these
high highs together.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.642
But... [sighs] Harley,

21:48.709 --> 21:50.810
you run from
one thing to the next,

21:50.877 --> 21:53.713
and at some point
that's gonna be me.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.781
And the truth is,

21:55.781 --> 21:57.884
I trust you with my life,

21:57.951 --> 22:01.721
but I don't trust you
with my heart.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.090
So, I... I'm marrying Kite Man.

22:05.826 --> 22:07.928
Hey, girl. How was the trip?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.395
It... it was good.

22:09.395 --> 22:10.596
Hey, you wanna
go make some chili,

22:10.596 --> 22:12.398
sit on the couch watching TV

22:12.398 --> 22:15.765
for four to six hours?

22:18.704 --> 22:20.406
[cries]
