WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:01.455
Tonight, is about Swedish cars.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

00:01.457 --> 00:06.307
They gave us the Saab with the
jutty bottom lip, a load of Volvos

00:06.307 --> 00:10.277
and now they've given us
a new type of car.

00:13.997 --> 00:16.667
This is the Koenigsegg.

00:16.667 --> 00:21.977
Sweden's attempt to land a punch
in the Italian-dominated world

00:21.977 --> 00:24.587
of the supercar.

00:24.587 --> 00:27.707
It's their answer to Lamborghini,

00:27.707 --> 00:30.835
Zonda and Ferrari.

00:33.707 --> 00:37.367
But Ferraris are built

00:37.367 --> 00:40.187
with a zest and a Latin passion.

00:40.187 --> 00:44.587
This is built
in a northern European way.

00:44.587 --> 00:50.617
For instance, it's made from
auto clay, epoxy pre-impregnated
carbonfibre.

00:50.617 --> 00:54.987
It's a true semi-monocoque -
the front end is mounted on
a chrome subframe

00:54.987 --> 00:59.067
and the engine sits on top of
a machined aluminium dry sub.

00:59.067 --> 01:02.867
There's also a supporting beam
for the rear subframe.

01:02.867 --> 01:08.707
That's interesting.
There's more too, because none of
this behind-the-scenes technology

01:08.707 --> 01:15.967
has interfered with what
Koenigsegg call the general
ichthyamorphic design principle -

01:15.967 --> 01:18.231
the aesthetics.

01:21.067 --> 01:25.027
The best bit of those aesthetics

01:25.027 --> 01:29.396
are the dihedral,
synchrohelix actuation doors.

01:33.637 --> 01:39.637
So. Is this the
most boring supercar in the world?

01:39.637 --> 01:42.907
Um... no.

01:42.907 --> 01:47.597
ENGINE REVS

01:47.597 --> 01:51.487
It's lighter, more aerodynamic

01:51.487 --> 01:55.627
and more powerful than a McLaren F1.

01:55.627 --> 02:01.737
Its supercharged V8
pumps out a simply colossal

02:01.737 --> 02:04.827
655 brake horsepower.

02:04.827 --> 02:07.227
Koenigsegg say

02:07.227 --> 02:10.267
it goes from 0-60 in three seconds

02:10.267 --> 02:14.977
and on to a top speed of
245 miles per hour.

02:14.977 --> 02:19.827
If those figures turn out
to be accurate, this will be,

02:19.827 --> 02:24.332
quite simply,
the fastest road car in the world

02:31.157 --> 02:37.937
Sadly, our test track isn't
long enough to test the top speed.

02:37.937 --> 02:42.697
The fastest I've been down here
is 170mph in the Pagani Zonda.

02:42.697 --> 02:46.967
And it wasn't much fun.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.617
It may sound simple -

02:49.617 --> 02:52.477
driving down a runway flat out.

02:52.477 --> 02:57.657
But there are problems. It is so
wide it affects your perspective.

02:57.657 --> 03:02.333
So you think, "Little bit faster, "
then before you know it -

03:03.357 --> 03:10.183
you end up here, 14 inches from the
end of the runway, in big trouble.

03:11.657 --> 03:17.797
It may look a bit daft, but we put
up markers to remind me to brake.

03:17.797 --> 03:22.787
Then I waited
until the wind had died down.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.477
And then,

03:25.477 --> 03:29.137
I went after the Zonda's record.

03:29.137 --> 03:31.742
TYRES SSREESH

03:34.937 --> 03:38.237
OK. Those G-forces hurt your neck

03:38.237 --> 03:43.237
I've gotta take as much speed as
I can through this bottom corner.

03:43.237 --> 03:45.797
Onto the main straight

03:45.797 --> 03:49.062
at 112 kilometres an hour.

03:50.997 --> 03:55.937
The supercharger whacking
the fuel out Into third

03:55.937 --> 03:58.197
Up to 7,000rpm. Into fourth.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.281
205kph. And into fifth.

04:01.281 --> 04:03.821
Bit of a bump.

04:03.821 --> 04:06.581
It's starting to weave a bit.

04:06.581 --> 04:09.581
Here we go, 258 and into sixth gear.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.701
268, 271, 277.

04:11.701 --> 04:14.647
Brake hard! Oh, hard!

04:16.461 --> 04:20.701
Engine, whoa!

04:20.701 --> 04:23.932
A button tells us how fast it was.

04:26.791 --> 04:31.061
Ho, ho, ho! 280 kilometres an hour!

04:31.061 --> 04:35.741
That's 174mph.

04:35.741 --> 04:39.301
Four mph faster
than I did in the Zonda.

04:39.301 --> 04:44.921
So, welcome, everyone, to the
fastest car we've ever tested here.

04:47.651 --> 04:52.304
This goes like nothing
I've ever driven.

04:54.291 --> 04:58.341
It feels like
nothing I've ever driven!

04:58.341 --> 05:02.591
The clutch,
steering and gearbox are heavy.

05:02.591 --> 05:06.101
It's a tonne and a half
of testosterone.

05:06.101 --> 05:11.661
You could drive this thing to the
gym, turn around, go home again,

05:11.661 --> 05:16.701
you'd have had more exercise
than if you'd done a workout.

05:18.111 --> 05:21.922
TYRES SCREECH

05:25.071 --> 05:28.370
Touch of understeer.

05:31.171 --> 05:34.561
You've gotta be so fast! Whoa!

05:40.241 --> 05:44.780
It really is absolutely brutal!

05:49.041 --> 05:54.650
A bloke at Koenigsegg said to turn
off traction control. You're joking!

06:00.311 --> 06:05.051
This is the meanest, angriest,
heaviest, most unforgiving machine

06:05.051 --> 06:07.731
I've ever come across.

06:07.731 --> 06:10.541
But it doesn't need to be.

06:10.541 --> 06:15.911
That is the beauty of this car. If
you don't like something, change it.

06:15.911 --> 06:20.911
The bodywork peels away and it's
adjustable - brake bias, suspension,

06:20.911 --> 06:23.741
ride height, power steering.

06:23.741 --> 06:28.671
You can set it up for a big, open
circuit like Silverstone one day.

06:28.671 --> 06:33.591
Next day, couple of minutes' work
and it's ready for Cadwell Park.

06:33.591 --> 06:39.951
If it's a lovely summer's night and
you want it set up to go to the pub

06:39.951 --> 06:46.511
then move that clip, this lever,
this clip and the roof comes out.

06:46.511 --> 06:51.311
Then you simply slide it
into the front, like so -

06:51.311 --> 06:53.831
perfect fit.

06:53.831 --> 07:00.816
Still room for a small bag. Slose
that down. And we're ready to go.

07:05.011 --> 07:09.631
The Koenigsegg doesn't have McLaren
and Ferrari's racing pedigree.

07:09.631 --> 07:14.111
It doesn't have
the visual clout of a Lambo

07:14.111 --> 07:20.789
or the quality of a Zonda, but it's
very fast and very, very special.

07:22.211 --> 07:27.422
It may be a Swede, but take it
from me, it's not a turnip.

07:35.091 --> 07:40.471
Let's get back to the safety theme
and the Koenigs-eugh-egg.

07:40.471 --> 07:45.411
We've established it's the fastest
car we've tested in a straight line.

07:45.411 --> 07:48.351
But what about round the track?

07:48.351 --> 07:54.771
It would have to beat the Zonda's
1m23. 8s. Can it? Willkommen Stoigen.

07:54.771 --> 07:57.251
This is the big one!

07:57.251 --> 08:01.891
Can the Koenigs-eugh-egg take
the lap record round our track?

08:01.891 --> 08:06.631
The car has over 100hp more
than the Zonda and loads of grip

08:06.631 --> 08:09.471
so if anything can do it, this will.

08:09.471 --> 08:14.631
COUNTRY AND WESTERN MUSIS
He shouldn't have gone to Tennessee.

08:14.631 --> 08:20.691
Into Shicago. He's very sideways!
Steady, Stiggy, this car bites!

08:20.691 --> 08:23.591
The Hammerhead. Will it understeer?

08:23.591 --> 08:27.431
Not a chance! Look at that.

08:27.431 --> 08:30.991
COUNTRY AND WESTERN MUSIS

08:30.991 --> 08:35.416
It's the follow through -
that's very fast!

08:37.431 --> 08:42.591
Over the first sector, it was
level pegging with the Zonda.

08:42.591 --> 08:47.431
Can it beat the Pagani to the end?
Bit of a slither. Across the line!

08:47.431 --> 08:51.271
So, was it faster than the Zonda?

08:51.271 --> 08:54.151
AUDIENSE: Yes. You're wrong.

08:54.151 --> 08:57.591
It did it in one minute, 23.9. Wow!

08:57.591 --> 09:00.471
A tenth off.

09:00.471 --> 09:05.391
Just a tenth off.
It's basically the same.

09:05.391 --> 09:11.391
It'll take me longer than 1m23s
to write it out. It's Koenigs...

09:11.391 --> 09:15.231
K-O-E... I've got that. Carry on.

09:15.231 --> 09:19.771
Do you want to see the Stig's
first attempt? ALL: Yes.

09:19.771 --> 09:24.521
OK. Play it.
Here he comes, up to Gambon.

09:24.521 --> 09:28.671
LAUGHTER AND SHEERS

09:28.671 --> 09:31.121
How are you doing?

09:31.121 --> 09:34.351
I've got about 12 Gs on there.

09:34.351 --> 09:38.081
I'll get it on there I reckon. Yeah!

09:38.081 --> 09:43.881
I have to say about the Koenigsegg
that, when I did the speed run,

09:43.881 --> 09:46.281
there's a dip.

09:46.281 --> 09:51.201
When you go at 130mph, it's fine,
but past 160mph, it's really ooh.

09:51.201 --> 09:54.481
And just before I set off on the...

09:54.481 --> 09:59.921
I missed a G. Keep going -
there's no X in it. Is there not?

09:59.921 --> 10:07.521
Just before the speed run, the guys
from Koenigsegg said they'd put
some gaffer tape round the window.

10:07.521 --> 10:12.581
That fills you with confidence!
Still an immensely impressive car.

10:12.581 --> 10:17.837
Come 'ere, let me finish it off for
you, you're gonna be here all day.

10:22.201 --> 10:27.401
Oh, that's how, yeah, you're right.
CC. There's no space for the time.

10:27.401 --> 10:30.351
It goes - I was hoping it might not.

10:30.351 --> 10:33.381
LAUGHTER

10:33.381 --> 10:37.631
It did it in 1m 23.9s.

10:37.631 --> 10:41.941
That is so close.
You've established that

10:41.941 --> 10:45.551
the Koenigseggseggseggviking's fast.

10:45.551 --> 10:50.361
That's good, but that's
not really about safety, is it?

10:50.361 --> 10:55.661
No. Are you planning do anything
with our safety theme at all?

10:55.661 --> 11:01.841
No. Didn't think so. Do you wanna
try? Maybe later. Actually, now.

11:01.841 --> 11:06.651
My guest tonight is best-known
for his role in Men Behaving Badly.

11:06.651 --> 11:12.141
But he was in Boon where he had
a motorcycle, so he had a helmet.

11:12.141 --> 11:15.861
Safety! Exactly. Neil Morrissey!

11:15.861 --> 11:19.421
SHEERING, WHISTLING AND APPLAUSE

11:19.421 --> 11:23.021
Hey! How are you? How are you?

11:23.021 --> 11:26.081
Very well. Have a seat.

11:29.141 --> 11:32.781
Bit of a problem, this.

11:32.781 --> 11:36.741
About six weeks ago,
we were on Parkinson.

11:36.741 --> 11:42.591
We had Parky to ask us questions.
Now what will do? Are you up to it?

11:42.591 --> 11:49.091
THEY IMITATE PARKINSON: I read,
or you read... You're into cars?

11:49.091 --> 11:52.879
Sricket. Let's talk about cricket.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.909
We ARE talking about safety. Yeah.

11:55.909 --> 11:58.979
Are you a safe driver? I am now.

11:58.979 --> 12:03.329
I definitely have been through
a mad area in my life.

12:03.329 --> 12:09.969
I've always had motorbikes.
Oh, no, really?
LAUGHTER

12:09.969 --> 12:15.059
They're fast. I knew one day a guest
would say, "I've got motorbikes",

12:15.059 --> 12:18.709
and I'd sit and pretend to be
interested.

12:18.709 --> 12:23.419
There's perfectly good reasons.
I understand why you don't like them.

12:23.419 --> 12:26.009
Why? Well, you're very tall. Yeah.

12:26.009 --> 12:29.759
You'd look like a clown
on a silly old...

12:29.759 --> 12:32.829
LAUGHTER

12:32.829 --> 12:38.869
Going round a very gentle bend,
knee on the floor. What's that about?

12:38.869 --> 12:41.619
Do you go on these biker weekends?

12:41.619 --> 12:46.669
Not really. I enjoy bikes. I'm not
a member of the biking fraternity.

12:46.669 --> 12:51.199
There's a group of friends
who like bikes, but we don't go...

12:51.199 --> 12:55.799
Cos there is modus operandi
for being a biker. They all meet...

12:55.799 --> 13:00.909
I live in the Cotswolds, OK?
Great roads round there, for, uh...

13:00.909 --> 13:06.209
No, that's it! Every single Sunday,
out they come! Well, yeah.

13:06.209 --> 13:11.539
MEE-EEE-EEE! From 100 miles away!
You can hear them leaving Edinburgh.

13:11.539 --> 13:15.429
MEE-EEE!
It's such a stupid noise they make!

13:15.429 --> 13:23.209
As they drive past your house at
90mph and you're clipping your hedge,
they go past going, "Sad BLEEP".

13:23.209 --> 13:26.918
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

13:29.869 --> 13:32.899
Now look. The thing is,

13:32.899 --> 13:38.369
I don't spend weekends dressed in
leather, going off with other men,

13:38.369 --> 13:43.549
a lot of whom have moustaches,
and drinking soft drinks in the pub.

13:43.549 --> 13:50.349
Yeah, I do have to agree with you
a bit there. There is a certain way
of dressing these days.

13:50.349 --> 13:53.139
We've got some photographs.

13:53.139 --> 13:58.789
This is the sort of thing.
That is dodgy. Do you wear that? No!

13:58.789 --> 14:02.149
This is a Power Ranger, isn't it?

14:02.149 --> 14:05.429
This is what they're dressing like.
Ohhh, no!

14:05.429 --> 14:09.789
How do you look cool,
walking into the pub like that?

14:09.789 --> 14:15.989
And going, "A bitter lemon, please,
cos I'm riding my Honda SBR. " Yeah.

14:15.989 --> 14:20.669
What bike have you got? I've got
a big, fat Triumph. A 955 ST Sprint.

14:20.669 --> 14:25.509
That's just a collection of numbers
and letters. Meaningless. It's fast.

14:25.509 --> 14:28.269
I understand that. It's fast.

14:28.269 --> 14:33.829
It's a nice, light bike. There's as
much variety with bikes as with cars,

14:33.829 --> 14:37.159
for the type of rider that you are.

14:37.159 --> 14:43.019
I did once go on something
called a Ducati Monster. Yeah!

14:43.019 --> 14:45.909
You're familiar with it? God, yeah.

14:45.909 --> 14:48.279
It was in Monte Carlo.

14:48.279 --> 14:53.189
You touched the throttle thing, no,
not like that, like that. Like this.

14:53.189 --> 14:56.839
If you did that,
it'd throw you off the back!

14:56.839 --> 15:01.569
I've never felt aleration...
You literally are holding on.

15:01.569 --> 15:06.549
With those big bikes, the Fireblade
and things, you just hang on, really.

15:06.549 --> 15:11.159
What do they call them in hospital?
Donors? Yeah. Absolutely.

15:11.159 --> 15:14.569
The worst are pizza delivery boys.
Oh, God!

15:14.569 --> 15:19.299
In the rain, with boxes on the back
thinking they're on a circuit.

15:19.299 --> 15:26.039
You're in a queue and the bike goes
down the middle, in a convertible,
have a good stretch.

15:26.039 --> 15:28.789
Scares the life out of them.

15:28.789 --> 15:32.639
I know! That's what car drivers
are jealous of.

15:32.639 --> 15:39.779
We can go through gaps.
I'm not jealous. You're arriving,
covered in leather, dirty, sweaty.

15:39.779 --> 15:45.519
I listened to Terry Wogan all the
way. You can do that on bikes too.

15:45.519 --> 15:50.229
You can have cooling systems in
your outfit and heating, all kinds.

15:50.229 --> 15:54.239
Take you 20 minutes to get off it!
Unplugging it.

15:54.239 --> 15:58.709
What car do you drive?
I've got a nice BMW, 745i.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.339
That's not very sporty.
No, but it's safe.

16:02.339 --> 16:06.659
I prefer to keep my madness
on the circuit.

16:06.659 --> 16:10.739
I like to go to race days.
Track days?

16:10.739 --> 16:15.479
We did those last week. Have you
tried them? Yeah, it's brilliant.

16:15.479 --> 16:18.989
You drive ten different fast cars
all day.

16:18.989 --> 16:24.059
The instructors are brilliant. Like
Stig. They wanna make you go faster!

16:24.059 --> 16:29.259
It's brilliant. And I did well.
I was top in four categories. Really?

16:29.259 --> 16:31.779
Oh, so you're quick in a car, then?

16:31.779 --> 16:38.659
Well, I have a go. One thing the
instructor said is that I'm fearless.
So that suits me, you know.

16:38.659 --> 16:41.979
Listen.
You've had a go at track days.

16:41.979 --> 16:44.659
Yeah. How do you think you got on?

16:44.659 --> 16:47.589
Do you think you're down here?

16:47.589 --> 16:52.899
I hope not! I walked the track today
in two minutes, five seconds!

16:52.899 --> 16:57.659
I did my second circuit and he was
still on it! Still trying to finish!

16:57.659 --> 17:01.489
Where would you like to be?
Near the top!

17:01.489 --> 17:06.858
Do you think you can beat
the chef duo? I'd like to.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.098
It's difficult. This is me at 1.50.

17:10.098 --> 17:14.779
Although that was recorded
with two other people in the car.

17:14.779 --> 17:20.059
I claim to be faster than JK when
I'm not here. Shall we find out?

17:20.059 --> 17:25.059
Yeah! Shall we see his lap? I'm
looking forward to this! Here we go.

17:25.059 --> 17:29.869
TYRES SSREESH
Too much wheel spin. 'I know. '

17:29.869 --> 17:34.059
What am I rambling on about?
I don't know.

17:34.059 --> 17:37.469
That's going there.
That's concentration.

17:37.469 --> 17:41.199
Yes! I'm repeating what Stig told me.

17:41.199 --> 17:46.699
That's smooth. If you go too fast
round the corners, you lose speed.

17:46.699 --> 17:54.299
This is tricky. It's
like threading a needle at 100mph.
You go from wide to narrow track.

17:54.299 --> 17:59.999
That's where Michael Gambon nearly
turned it. You're across the line!

17:59.999 --> 18:02.684
APPLAUSE

18:08.259 --> 18:11.139
Well! I know how fast you did it.

18:11.139 --> 18:14.599
Tell me! Not that I'm competitive.

18:14.599 --> 18:19.689
It's one minute. It's quicker than
Harry Enfield and Richard Whiteley.

18:19.689 --> 18:22.539
Another record's gone this week.

18:22.539 --> 18:27.033
49. You're quicker than me, mate.
WOA-HO-HO!

18:28.819 --> 18:33.249
Well done.
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

18:33.249 --> 18:35.819
That is a quick time.

18:35.819 --> 18:39.109
APPLAUSE

18:39.109 --> 18:43.199
Only JK to beat. Now get out.

18:43.199 --> 18:47.929
That's fantastic! Well,
it's not that fantastic, actually.

18:47.929 --> 18:55.269
It's funny watching people's faces.
Everybody says they're not bothered,
you get to that bit... Ooh, no.

18:55.269 --> 19:00.349
That's the most exciting bit for me,
finding out. It's a good one.

19:00.349 --> 19:04.539
He won't be pleased.
JK will be cross.

19:04.539 --> 19:10.569
I'll book a table at the restaurant.
I'll be there in three minutes!

19:10.569 --> 19:14.629
Ladies and gentlemen,
Neil Morrissey!

19:14.629 --> 19:16.733
APPLAUSE

19:24.545 --> 19:27.575
When this car first arrived,
late last year,

19:27.575 --> 19:32.625
I found it a bit, well, strong.
In fact, I laughed.

19:32.625 --> 19:35.375
But now, I feel a bit of a chump,

19:35.375 --> 19:41.519
Iike the people asked to invest
Â£10 in Trivial Pursuit who didn't.

19:43.215 --> 19:48.575
At best, I might respect them
for their boldness, but oh, no.

19:48.575 --> 19:54.309
Renault have done it again. They've
made a car that is completely cool.

19:56.455 --> 20:01.705
This is Hoxton Square, officially
the coolest place in Britain.

20:01.705 --> 20:04.185
No-one here works in accounts.

20:07.145 --> 20:10.015
If you walk over the square,

20:10.015 --> 20:14.745
when you get across it, your
clothes have gone out of fashion,

20:14.745 --> 20:16.633
and back in again.

20:18.135 --> 20:23.265
Just look how well the car
sits here. And don't forget,

20:23.265 --> 20:26.535
it's a small family car.

20:26.535 --> 20:32.415
Everything else, even the
Ford Focus, looks a bit last week.

20:32.415 --> 20:35.985
It may not drive as well as a Focus,

20:35.985 --> 20:42.625
but you don't care.
It's well priced, well-equipped
and has a decent choice of engines.

20:42.625 --> 20:49.225
The interior is clever.
I could take all my possessions
and lose them in here,

20:49.225 --> 20:54.345
out of sight. Mothers'll be fishing
kids out of cubby holes for years!

20:56.345 --> 21:01.665
But if you buy your next family car
because it's pretty,

21:01.665 --> 21:06.425
or because it's easy to keep tidy,
you need your head looking at.

21:06.425 --> 21:12.605
We're good at going faster, but
we can't cope if things go wrong.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.165
In a crash of between 30 and 40mph,

21:16.165 --> 21:21.745
your head will be thrown forwards
with a force of 40 or 50G.

21:21.745 --> 21:27.765
That means it weighs, suddenly,
50 times as much as usual.

21:27.765 --> 21:34.265
Your neck is under a strain
of two kilonewtons, like holding
a 200 kilo weight with it

21:34.265 --> 21:36.893
or being hung.

21:39.625 --> 21:44.665
The bones in your legs are put
under a stress of four kilonewtons.

21:44.665 --> 21:49.705
That's like jumping off a very high
wall with an adult on your back.

21:52.665 --> 21:57.355
Suddenly, the Megane's safety
features look more interesting.

21:57.355 --> 22:03.605
Like crumple zones. It's designed
to come apart, dissipating energy,

22:03.605 --> 22:06.865
Ieaving you safe inside.

22:06.865 --> 22:10.665
But first, the car is doing things
to protect you.

22:10.665 --> 22:13.345
When it detects a crash starting,

22:13.345 --> 22:17.685
the seat belt has pre-tensioners,
located either side.

22:17.685 --> 22:21.465
The belt clamps you down
into the seat.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.965
As your weight's thrown forward,

22:23.965 --> 22:30.545
the mounting points are designed to
peel away from the body of the car.
It works like a tin opening.

22:30.545 --> 22:35.225
There are weak points engineered in.
It's called a load limiter.

22:35.225 --> 22:38.975
It does just that,
slowing you down gently.

22:38.975 --> 22:43.865
Then there are the air bags.
There are eight in here - eight!

22:43.865 --> 22:50.031
Now, normally, at this point,
we'd just show you the crash test.

22:51.765 --> 22:56.315
That'd be the end of the road test.
But not this time.

22:56.315 --> 23:01.955
We're not going to send this car
back to Renault in the same shape.

23:01.955 --> 23:06.765
We're gonna crash it into that car
at over 30mph.

23:06.765 --> 23:10.615
We won't use dummies.
We're gonna use him.

23:10.615 --> 23:14.195
This is Lee,
our Top Gear brave person.

23:14.195 --> 23:17.115
He has crashed cars before for TV,

23:17.115 --> 23:21.836
but in stunts where they used
helmets, harnesses and roll cages.

23:22.915 --> 23:27.675
But this is no stunt. He won't wear
a helmet or protective clothing.

23:27.675 --> 23:30.555
There are no extra safety features.

23:30.555 --> 23:35.995
Lee will crash this standard Megane,
relying on the car to protect him,

23:35.995 --> 23:38.595
just as you'd have to do.

23:38.595 --> 23:43.035
This has never been done before
on a car programme.

23:43.035 --> 23:50.635
But the Megane is a small family
hatch that thousands will drive
with big claims made about safety.

23:50.635 --> 23:55.186
Let's put RenauIt's money
where their mouth is.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

24:18.915 --> 24:22.715
Lee, can we open it?
Well, the door opens.

24:22.715 --> 24:27.615
How are you? Cor, it doesn't half
generate some heat. How do you feel?

24:27.615 --> 24:30.285
Um...

24:30.285 --> 24:35.115
How fast were you going when you
went in? About 30.

24:35.115 --> 24:37.915
So it was 30... ish.

24:37.915 --> 24:42.915
About the speed... About the speed
of a general mum going to the shops.

24:42.915 --> 24:47.915
The air bags went off. Did you feel
anything else? Seat belts, anything?

24:47.915 --> 24:53.135
I'm glad I went to the toilet before
this. It's pulled me into the seat.

24:53.135 --> 24:59.665
The lap strap across your waist,
I felt really tug me back hard.
It's uncomfortable now.

25:00.975 --> 25:06.205
There's a loud pop, a bit louder
than I imagined it would have been.

25:06.205 --> 25:10.815
Shall we help you out?
No, I think I can...

25:10.815 --> 25:17.855
Have a look at the front.
You did it, so you should see it.
The door...the door is fine!

25:17.855 --> 25:24.274
From here, it's not bad. No! I mean,
it's squashed a bit. The radiator.

25:24.274 --> 25:29.615
Thank you very much! Live crash test
dummy! That's fantastic! It works.

25:29.615 --> 25:34.285
I've just got one thing to do.
Telephone Renault. Oops.

25:34.285 --> 25:39.194
You'd better do that. I'll do this
alone. It's one of those calls!

25:39.194 --> 25:43.874
Many believe that all cars
behave the same in an accident.

25:43.874 --> 25:46.905
Well, that simply isn't the case.

25:46.905 --> 25:53.354
Here is a Toyota Avensis.
This is a Euro NCAP five-star car,
as good as it gets.

25:53.354 --> 25:59.775
It's been crashed into
a deformable concrete block
at 40mph in a laboratory.

25:59.775 --> 26:04.185
If we come round here,
we find the seat has barely moved,

26:04.185 --> 26:09.425
the steering wheel has barely moved
and, crucially, the door closes.

26:09.425 --> 26:15.725
That shows us that
the bit where you're sitting
hasn't crumpled up at all.

26:15.725 --> 26:22.145
We can see the difference
between these cars. This Impian
has had the same crash -

26:22.145 --> 26:25.885
40mph, concrete barrier,
in the same place.

26:25.885 --> 26:29.505
Straight away
I can barely open the door.

26:29.505 --> 26:36.325
It's been bent out of shape here,
which means the cabin has been
deformed and that's where you'd be.

26:36.325 --> 26:42.785
Inside, we can see why this is
a three-star car. The brake pedal
has been shoved up here.

26:42.785 --> 26:48.234
Your foot would have been on there.
That'd damage your ankle and leg.

26:48.234 --> 26:53.925
The steering wheel has been shoved
back. That could damage your chest.

26:53.925 --> 26:58.124
So, the Proton is a bit less money
than the Avensis,

26:58.124 --> 27:02.794
and if you want to save
a bit of money, go ahead.

27:02.794 --> 27:08.244
You can't tell by looking which car
will do best. This is a Ford Fiesta.

27:08.244 --> 27:12.964
It's had the same crash -
40mph, deformable concrete barrier.

27:12.964 --> 27:17.124
We can see why this is
a four-star car. It's not bad.

27:17.124 --> 27:23.204
That's because it's designed
to send the energy around you
and protect you.

27:23.204 --> 27:27.904
It's got bars running through here,
so it held its shape.

27:27.904 --> 27:35.844
There are bars running along
the door. All the energy goes from
the front, the crash, around you.

27:35.844 --> 27:41.604
Compare that to a Freelander. This
is the kind of car families buy.

27:41.604 --> 27:47.964
This pillar, where it meets
the roof, has crumpled,
so any more speed and that'll go.

27:47.964 --> 27:54.544
The roof has given up the ghost
here. The door has had it.
Look how much that has folded up.

27:54.544 --> 27:59.114
The seat, the steering wheel
and the pedals have moved.

27:59.114 --> 28:06.214
You've got a daughter. Yeah.
Would you let her go in this
three-star car having seen this?

28:06.214 --> 28:10.604
These crash tests change
how you look at cars completely.

28:10.604 --> 28:13.554
It's a big, chunky family car and...

28:13.554 --> 28:19.694
Does anybody want to know...?
We've got a list of
the Euro NCAP results here.

28:19.694 --> 28:26.304
Does anybody want to know
how their car fared? An MGZT.
An MGZT. Let's have a look.

28:26.304 --> 28:31.444
That's basically a Rover 75.
I've got it. I've got it.

28:31.444 --> 28:36.254
There you go. Rover 75, 2,000 -
that's a four-star car.

28:36.254 --> 28:42.054
You're OK. You can have an accident
on the way home. Anybody else?

28:42.054 --> 28:47.204
Yeah? A4, Audi A4. Have you done
that? I've got it. The Audi A4?

28:47.204 --> 28:54.284
That again... Here's the difference
a few years make. '97, two stars.
What year's your car? 2003.

28:54.284 --> 28:56.754
It's a four-star.

28:56.754 --> 29:02.494
It's not bad. Srash into another
A4 and you'll be OK. Anyone else?

29:02.494 --> 29:08.284
A Daewoo Nexia. A what? Daewoo Nexia.
A Daewoo Nexia! Have you got one?

29:08.284 --> 29:11.514
No, they haven't bothered!

29:11.514 --> 29:13.724
Anyone else?

29:13.724 --> 29:17.834
Mercedes S-class. That's
a five-star one, isn't it? Yeah.

29:17.834 --> 29:22.874
It's a '99. Oh, a '99. It'll be
interesting to see how it differs.

29:22.874 --> 29:26.754
Unless it's after 2001,
it is a two-star car.

29:26.754 --> 29:32.574
What's yours? '99. It's two stars.
Drive carefully on the way home!

29:32.574 --> 29:39.834
If something pulls out, really
brake hard, OK? A two-star car you
really don't want to be crashing.

29:39.834 --> 29:41.094
Seriously.

29:41.094 --> 29:43.574
Anyone got a Ford Escort?

29:43.574 --> 29:48.477
You've got a Ford Escort? Cosworth.
It doesn't matter. Goodbye.

29:49.524 --> 29:55.494
You've got a...? A Bentley. I bet
they haven't crashed one of those!

29:55.494 --> 29:59.334
I bet they got to the day
and thought, "I can't! "

29:59.334 --> 30:06.554
The Bentley Turbo went through
the concrete block and carried on.
It's still having an accident.

30:06.554 --> 30:12.814
Yeah? Sitroen Saxo.
A Sitroen Saxo. That's kind of
like a carrier bag, isn't it?

30:12.814 --> 30:18.714
Have you done a Sitroen Saxo? Yeah,
it's a two-star. It's a two-star
car.

30:18.714 --> 30:21.434
Whoops! How does that make you feel,

30:21.434 --> 30:25.914
knowing your car will behave
in an accident worse than...

30:25.914 --> 30:32.044
The Freelander is a three-star car.
Yours is two-star.
How does it make you feel?

30:32.044 --> 30:37.034
Very nervous. The strange thing
about safety is you just...

30:37.034 --> 30:41.074
You see that and think,
"I've no need for a car. "

30:41.074 --> 30:45.443
In a Fiesta you could have
the same accident and be OK.

30:48.114 --> 30:53.044
Now, an apology. I forgot to give
you the price of the Koenigsegg.

30:53.044 --> 30:56.714
It's Â£354,000.

30:56.714 --> 30:59.924
AUDIENSE: Oooh! Sorry about that.

30:59.924 --> 31:03.974
Let me cheer you up
with a world exclusive. This.

31:03.974 --> 31:08.814
This is, I think, the most
beautiful car I have ever seen.

31:08.814 --> 31:15.384
It doesn't look wrong
from any angle. It's the new
Aston Martin V8 Vantage.

31:15.384 --> 31:19.654
It's got a 4.3L V8 engine,
rear-wheel drive,

31:19.654 --> 31:24.374
gearbox at the back
for perfect weight distribution.

31:24.374 --> 31:29.684
It's light, very fast and it'll
cost a very reasonable Â£70,000.

31:29.684 --> 31:35.144
Going on sale in 2005. So have you
ordered a Porsche 911 recently?

31:35.144 --> 31:37.999
LAUGHTER

31:40.434 --> 31:42.294
I have a safety thing.

31:42.294 --> 31:45.674
Good. Look, it's this green thing.

31:45.674 --> 31:48.814
And it is...? It's a hearing aid.

31:48.814 --> 31:48.814
Funky hearing aid.
I'm deaf but I'm funky.

31:48.814 --> 31:54.084
Funky hearing aid.
I'm deaf but I'm funky.
HIGH-PITSHED BEEP

31:54.084 --> 31:57.494
It makes you look
like a total berk.

31:57.494 --> 32:01.894
You put it on while you're driving
and if you nod off...

32:01.894 --> 32:04.154
BEEP

32:04.154 --> 32:06.574
LAUGHTER

32:06.574 --> 32:10.074
Jeremy, well done!
I think that's safe!

32:10.074 --> 32:13.454
APPLAUSE
Just...

32:13.454 --> 32:18.214
Before we get carried away,
I've spotted a few drawbacks.

32:18.214 --> 32:22.114
You're driving along,
you change channels.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.154
BEEP

32:24.154 --> 32:24.154
You go into the glove box.

32:24.154 --> 32:26.874
You go into the glove box.
BEEP

32:26.874 --> 32:29.324
I'm not sure.

32:29.324 --> 32:33.054
CONTINUOUS BEEP
Oh, turn it off!

32:33.054 --> 32:40.054
I think that's your second safety
mess-up. Two strikes and you're out.
One more to redeem yourself.

32:40.054 --> 32:43.512
I've got a good one -
here's some war.

32:44.594 --> 32:47.394
After World War II,

32:47.394 --> 32:54.141
General Patton said victory
would not have been possible
without the Willis Jeep.

32:56.154 --> 33:00.194
The modern-day equivalent
is the Humvie.

33:00.194 --> 33:04.724
Its wheels are wide apart
and fit in the tracks left by tanks.

33:04.724 --> 33:07.574
16 inches of ground clearance -

33:07.574 --> 33:11.804
double that
of any other off-road car.

33:11.804 --> 33:16.854
When the first Gulf War was over,
some generals followed Patton,

33:16.854 --> 33:20.324
saying victory was due
in no small part

33:20.324 --> 33:23.194
to this incredible car.

33:23.194 --> 33:27.934
The Iraqi Army's running away
also had something to do with it.

33:27.934 --> 33:34.684
Arnold Schwarzenegger asked
the makers of the Humvie if they
could do a civilian version.

33:34.684 --> 33:41.544
Because... We're fascinated,
with you all the way. But it's
nothing to do with safety, is it?

33:41.544 --> 33:44.024
No, it has. Watch this.

33:48.884 --> 33:53.304
If you want the safest car
in the world - this is it.

33:53.304 --> 33:59.804
You'd call the performance
quite good IF this were a boat.

33:59.804 --> 34:04.194
You never go fast enough
to have a crash.

34:04.194 --> 34:08.551
If someone runs into you -
you're never going to know.

34:17.103 --> 34:21.684
There are some drawbacks,
like having a conversation.

34:21.684 --> 34:26.214
They're so far apart, the seats
are in different time zones.

34:26.214 --> 34:31.964
Then there's the enormous 6.5L,
turbo-charged diesel engine.

34:31.964 --> 34:37.724
It's in the middle of the room,
and the torque-converters

34:37.724 --> 34:42.771
in the wheels sound like giant,
nuclear-powered pepper grinders.

34:42.771 --> 34:46.710
Small wonder Arnold
shouted in his films.

34:46.710 --> 34:50.391
AS ARNIE: I want your motorcycle.

34:50.391 --> 34:53.440
AS MOVIE VOISE-OVER:
He will not stop!

34:54.981 --> 35:02.231
And the problems aren't limited
to talking. There are other issues.

35:02.231 --> 35:05.371
Can you guess what they are?

35:05.371 --> 35:10.771
Oh, this is a narrow street.
And somebody's parked on it.

35:10.771 --> 35:12.261
Huh-hmm.

35:15.271 --> 35:22.231
Stupid place to park! Don't
you know people have big military
vehicles that need to get through?

35:22.231 --> 35:25.940
I fear I may be causing
a few problems.

35:30.241 --> 35:32.171
Sorry.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.480
Sorry.

35:39.111 --> 35:44.781
What on earth are we going to do?
I'm going to have to back up.

35:44.781 --> 35:50.196
That's about 14 cars! It's the end
of the world as we know it. Sorry.

35:52.971 --> 35:56.179
Sorry. They're very good-natured.

35:57.311 --> 36:02.191
Try this anywhere else, I'd have
had my head kicked in by now.

36:02.191 --> 36:07.711
The worse thing about the Humvie
is not the size or the noise.

36:07.711 --> 36:14.435
It's that, as you drive along,
you can see people on the pavements
all mouthing the same thing...

36:19.981 --> 36:22.415
.. "There goes Shris Eubank. "

36:24.451 --> 36:27.181
This is a terrible car.

36:27.181 --> 36:34.081
General Motors has bought the
rights to make a civilian version,
and they've made a new version,

36:34.081 --> 36:39.257
which is kinder to the environment
and softer on your skin.

36:40.281 --> 36:43.731
This is it - the Humvie H2.

36:43.731 --> 36:48.481
It doesn't look like the kind
of car Shris Eubank would drive.

36:48.481 --> 36:52.281
It looks like the sort of car
he designed.

36:54.241 --> 36:58.621
It's available here
with left-hand drive for Â£60,000.

37:00.231 --> 37:06.871
It seems a lot when you peel away
this amazing body and find out
what's underneath.

37:06.871 --> 37:11.941
Yep, under the abs and the pecs,
it's a GMS Tahoe,

37:11.941 --> 37:17.541
which is ugly, big, slow,
and competely flummoxed by snow,

37:17.541 --> 37:22.281
mud, gravel, soil, grass clippings,
drizzle, or even a light breeze.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.704
It's rubbish.

37:27.191 --> 37:31.361
As a result,
the H2 is not going to win any wars.

37:31.361 --> 37:38.085
If the US ever decides we need
a regime change, they won't storm
over the White Sliffs in an H2.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.742
Then there's the fuel consumption.

37:43.361 --> 37:47.401
I tested an H2 in the desert
last year

37:47.401 --> 37:50.347
and got 3.3 miles to the gallon.

37:52.561 --> 37:55.941
Unbelievably,
it's worse on the road.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.601
If I put my foot down,

37:58.601 --> 38:05.281
the fuel consumption metre says
I'm doing one mile to the gallon.

38:05.281 --> 38:06.741
One!

38:06.741 --> 38:10.961
The problem is,
while it's smaller and lighter

38:10.961 --> 38:17.681
and easier to thread through town
than the original Hummer,
it's still nearly four tonnes.

38:17.681 --> 38:21.201
And it has a 6L V8 petrol engine.

38:21.201 --> 38:24.561
Don't think that makes it fast.

38:24.561 --> 38:30.891
Do what you want with the macho
gear lever, it still won't go.

38:30.891 --> 38:34.081
It stops like a duck
on a frozen lake.

38:34.081 --> 38:40.001
The thing is, though,
that if I may liken most cars

38:40.001 --> 38:45.371
to little black dresses, this is a
ball gown with sequins and a bustle.

38:45.371 --> 38:51.001
And look at that row of lights
on the roof - that's a tiara!

38:51.001 --> 38:56.681
It's a Roman orgy, a Hawaiian
barbecue, a Viennese waltz

38:56.681 --> 39:01.161
a helicopter gun ship attack
on Las Vegas rolled into one.

39:01.161 --> 39:03.001
Fabulous!

39:03.001 --> 39:09.041
Yes, it's thirsty and hopeless
and expensive, but I like it.

39:09.041 --> 39:14.331
Unlike the H1, it feels like a car
to drive - it's quiet and refined,

39:14.331 --> 39:17.501
well-equipped, and even practical.

39:17.501 --> 39:21.611
If we look in the back,
we find that,

39:21.611 --> 39:24.561
unlike the H1, it has three seats.

39:24.561 --> 39:30.961
Look at this - a handle so robust,
not even a six-year-old
can break it.

39:30.961 --> 39:33.571
We come round and open the boot -

39:33.571 --> 39:38.441
another man-sized handle -
and inside there's another seat!

39:38.441 --> 39:43.571
And space for a dog
AND, if we lower this like so,

39:43.571 --> 39:46.041
space for two dogs.

39:46.041 --> 39:51.111
If you concentrate REALLY hard,
you can justify this thing.

39:51.111 --> 39:57.251
I've managed to convince myself
that it's a sensible family saloon.

39:57.251 --> 40:01.811
My wife's not so sure,
but you know, given time...

40:01.811 --> 40:05.851
she'll come round
to my way of thinking.

40:05.851 --> 40:12.851
What you have to understand
is that the H2 makes you feel
like a seven-year-old boy.

40:12.851 --> 40:17.800
And for that alone,
you have to love it.

40:23.411 --> 40:29.331
Are you seriously saying that
this revolting piece of pig iron

40:29.331 --> 40:31.931
is a serious alternative to an X5?

40:31.931 --> 40:34.331
It's fantastic!

40:34.331 --> 40:37.211
It's revolting! Slightly revolting.

40:37.211 --> 40:42.241
The point is that it reminds you of
what it is that you love about cars.

40:42.241 --> 40:48.931
Every journey is an event.
I want to go into town.
I'll save up and come back.

40:48.931 --> 40:54.011
There are some journeys in this
that are an event.

40:54.011 --> 40:58.771
I saw one, or one just like it,
in Manchester a while ago.

40:58.771 --> 41:03.531
We'd done some filming and
the owner's son came to collect it.

41:03.531 --> 41:10.741
He was showing off a bit -
"Let's see if it fits through
a drive-through at a burger shop. "

41:10.741 --> 41:17.211
Slams it into reverse
and backs straight over a BMW Z3.
Splat! Like it wasn't there.

41:17.211 --> 41:22.371
And which car won? Ah, I see where
you're going - it was the Hummer.

41:22.371 --> 41:27.111
Size IS important in these things.
That's a bit harsh!

41:27.111 --> 41:29.931
That was a little cruel.

41:29.931 --> 41:36.851
Getting back to the safety thing -
if you run into another car,
you're better off in something big.

41:36.851 --> 41:42.596
They don't come much bigger or
tougher. That's where you're wrong.

41:46.781 --> 41:51.611
This is the Talon Riot
Control Vehicle. Big, isn't it?

41:51.611 --> 41:56.271
This is the real deal -
half a million quids worth.

41:56.271 --> 42:01.321
It's armour-plated to withstand
that terrorist favourite, the AK47.

42:01.321 --> 42:06.341
'More than that, I was lucky -
that skin is also electrified.

42:06.341 --> 42:12.271
'20,000 volts at the fingertips
of your aggressors in seconds. '

42:12.271 --> 42:16.731
I could accommodate 14
of my nearest and dearest in here.

42:16.731 --> 42:22.681
They'd each have their own
shooting hatch, which is nice.

42:22.681 --> 42:27.701
If things turn really nasty and
you're stuck here for a few days,

42:27.701 --> 42:32.691
there's a fridge for your beer,
you can monitor the oxygen levels,

42:32.691 --> 42:35.581
and...there's a lavatory.

42:35.581 --> 42:37.621
Lovely.

42:37.621 --> 42:41.941
Now that is what
I call a control panel -

42:41.941 --> 42:45.081
grenade launcher, impulse generator.

42:45.081 --> 42:46.971
Lovely.

42:46.971 --> 42:51.021
SHOUTING AND JEERING

42:53.371 --> 42:58.252
Oh, dear, that's a bit tedious.
Still, if I press this button...

43:03.981 --> 43:10.081
If the yobs still won't go, you can
deafen them with the PA system.

43:10.081 --> 43:15.491
MUSIS: Distorted version of "I Will
Always Love You" by Whitney Houston

43:15.491 --> 43:20.341
With the infrared spotlights
and grenades, you should be OK.

43:20.341 --> 43:26.901
The thing is, it's all a bit
defensive. What if I want
to go on the offensive?

43:26.901 --> 43:29.631
What can I do in my Talon?

43:34.141 --> 43:40.091
Well, if things get really nasty,
I can always just head-butt stuff.

44:07.901 --> 44:10.563
That should do it!

44:12.621 --> 44:15.442
APPLAUSE

44:18.471 --> 44:22.641
A car that really is
safer than houses.

44:22.641 --> 44:26.020
That's it for this week.
See you next week.
