09:22.429 --> 09:23.762
Big Bang.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.721

- Monument.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.733
- Commemorating washed
up drug dealers.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.901

10:06.640 --> 10:07.672

They ain't been trapping.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.418
2 Chainz, there
wasn't no 2 Chainz.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.820
He had no chains on.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.991
He's like, I'm 2 Chainz.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.493
I smoked out with a dude
named Mark Zuckerberg.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.028
Smoked him out, he was like,

10:30.063 --> 10:30.996

10:31.031 --> 10:32.497

10:32.532 --> 10:34.833
I introduced Jay-Z to Beyonce.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.702
I introduced Whitney to Bobby.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.472
(crowd groans)

10:41.742 --> 10:43.942
But it was a time when
they needed each other,

10:43.977 --> 10:45.477
and then things--

10:45.512 --> 10:47.512

11:16.143 --> 11:17.976
How you gonna be

11:18.011 --> 11:20.078

11:31.758 --> 11:33.658
- Man, how she gonna

11:33.694 --> 11:34.826
She ain't even that cute anyway.

11:34.861 --> 11:39.164
She needs to stop skipping
leg day with her little ugly.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.632
(picture crashes)

11:40.667 --> 11:42.167
- [Roger's Mom]
Roger, what was that?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.835
- Nothing, Mom.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.970
- [Roger's Mom] Do I have
to get out of my chair?

11:46.006 --> 11:47.672
- No, Mama, stay in your chair.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.642
- [Roger's Mom] All right

Hey, look at this.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.989

12:06.960 --> 12:08.860
Look like instructions
for growing

12:08.895 --> 12:10.995
some kinda super
weed or something.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.697
- Yeah, that's good,
but we need to smoke

12:12.733 --> 12:14.833
the blunt that's on
front of it here.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.000
- We don't know what that do.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.002
- Who cares, Roger,
don't nobody care.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.004
It's better than the
twigs we been smoking.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.706
- That's true.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.707
- Race you.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.143
(upbeat music)

12:38.759 --> 12:40.125
What, huh?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.227

12:49.903 --> 12:52.070
- Oh, one, two, three.

(both yelling)

13:04.351 --> 13:08.019
(playful electronic music)

13:25.806 --> 13:26.971
- The hell just happened, man?

13:27.007 --> 13:30.842
- I'm freaking out man, we
must be back on the west side.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.210
- Somebody's coming, man.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.213
(suspenseful music)

13:38.051 --> 13:40.919
- Oh shit, Roger, I
forgot to tell you this.

13:40.954 --> 13:45.156
I had a dream last week and
this is how we both die.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.894
- Who the hell are you?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.197
- Yeah, identify
yourselves right now.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.131
Wait a minute, are we supposed

13:53.166 --> 13:55.233

y'all got helmets?

13:55.268 --> 13:58.102
(coughing)

13:58.138 --> 13:59.938
- No, we just hot boxing.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.073
They look fly, don't they?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.242
- Where are we?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.945
- You just smoked
yourself a one-way ticket

14:06.980 --> 14:08.279
to a player's party.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.114
- Players party.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.983
- Who are you?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.952
- It don't matter who I am.
- That's right.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.387
- It only matters what I know.
- Tell 'em.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.089
- That is the gas.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.961
The loud pack.
- That loud pack, ha ha.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.930
(choir vocalizing)

14:30.871 --> 14:32.136
- I ain't never seen
nothing like that

14:32.172 --> 14:33.972
in them little
projects y'all hang in.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.974
- Never.
- This is so beautiful,

14:36.009 --> 14:38.276
I just need a minute, y'all.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.811
- Is this heaven?

14:39.846 --> 14:41.980
- Does this look like
heaven to you, fool?

14:42.015 --> 14:44.315
Y'all wouldn't
make it in anyway.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.850
- Why are we here?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.252
- Y'all found the
Weed Bible, right?

14:47.287 --> 14:48.353
- Right?
- Yeah but,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.855
what do we do with it?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.991
- Goodness.
- Learn how to grow some weed?

14:53.026 --> 14:54.158
- Duh!

14:54.194 --> 14:55.827
- This book could
change human history

14:55.862 --> 14:59.097
and obviously you

14:59.132 --> 15:01.165
- Both of you.
- I knew I was special,

15:01.201 --> 15:02.100
I knew it.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.437
- Too soon, way too soon.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.139
- Let me learn you
little fellas something.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.040
- Learn 'em something.
- Marijuana's been

15:09.075 --> 15:11.876
around since B.C.
- You know what that is?

15:11.912 --> 15:13.311
- Before crack, sure have.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.447
- It's before Christ,
man, before Christ.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.149
- I got the before
part right, though.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.884
- Now that **** that

15:19.920 --> 15:21.119
we have another name for.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.187
It was called sinsemilla.

Give 'em something else.

15:29.930 --> 15:34.032
And this right here my
friend, is the ultimate bud.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.035
- [Whispered Voice]
It's gorgeous.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.470
- It smells like angel farts.
- Farts of an angel.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.039
- What's it called?

15:41.074 --> 15:42.874
- It's called...

15:42.909 --> 15:45.243
(mystical tinkling)

15:45.278 --> 15:46.911
- I wonder how you spell that.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.847
- You smoke it, you
don't spell it, dummy.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.317
- Now this weed right
here will give you

15:52.352 --> 15:57.188
supernatural ability to fight
off evil, dangerous things.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.491
Make sure you protect
this bible with your life.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.226
- Your life, you heard him.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.729
- Come on.
- Go on, hit 'em one time.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.272
(Calvin and Roger screaming)

16:14.307 --> 16:16.541
- Hell, what year is it?

16:16.576 --> 16:17.675
Who am I?

16:17.711 --> 16:22.513
- Bruh, I feel like the universe
just twerked on my face.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.215
That weed is evil.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.785
Let's hit it again.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.555
- I feel you, but

16:30.590 --> 16:33.424
we can get our money,
cuz, with the weed.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.559

in town right now.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.367
- I'm in.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.568
- And if we grow
this, we can sell it

16:43.603 --> 16:45.436
and make enough money
to start our business.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.372
- Bitch, didn't I

16:47.407 --> 16:49.040
And you not listening, I'm in.

Look, I'm tired of being broke

16:56.616 --> 16:58.282
and I'm tired of staying

16:58.318 --> 17:00.284
- [Roger's Mom] What

17:00.320 --> 17:01.386
- Ma, stop listening.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.388

27:48.267 --> 27:50.901
Search around, you're looking
in the wrong place right here.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.903
Go down there, ask the
Asian people down there.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.038
You ain't asked them?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.239
The white people over there,

27:55.274 --> 27:57.041
being got all their
windows blacked out.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.142
- We didn't check
the white people.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.910
- You ain't even see, they
go in and out the house.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.211
They could be in there
murdering people.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.913
I'm not saying that
they stole anything,

28:02.948 --> 28:04.381
'cause that would be racist.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.350
I'm just saying, check the,

28:06.385 --> 28:08.385
what you do is check
the high school.

28:08.421 --> 28:11.255
Oh, them high boys down
there, they got no respect.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.190
All they looking for
is somebody to get.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.291
They got the face all day.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.627
Maybe they got your ****.

28:16.662 --> 28:17.928
- Is that a booty cloud?

28:17.963 --> 28:20.130
- No, look more to the left.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.900
- [Both] Damn, booty cloud.

28:22.935 --> 28:26.270
- [Big Bang] That's
the booty cloud, woo!

28:26.305 --> 28:29.339
(school bell rings)

28:30.910 --> 28:32.943
- Yo man, why you wearing
that stupid-ass hat?

28:32.978 --> 28:34.278
- What's wrong with it?

28:34.313 --> 28:36.213
I used to wear it
back in the day.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.116
You gotta understand,
cuz, we gotta blend in.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.984
Come on now, gotta trust me.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.086
- Come on, man.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.987
- Come on, twizzler head.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.089
- [Announcer]
Students, please report

28:45.124 --> 28:48.625
to the buses for the Verdant
Biokinetic field trip.

28:48.661 --> 28:49.960
- Aight, now check this out.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.062
We looking for kids
with clean kicks,

28:52.098 --> 28:53.964
'cause that mean
they stole our stash.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.999
- Bet you they did,
I bet you they did.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.969
Oh snap, it's McMullen.
- Yup, McMullen.

28:59.004 --> 29:01.905
- Oh, I did not know he was
still the principal here.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.007
- He is.
- He can't see me.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.109
Can't see me.

29:06.145 --> 29:09.113
You know he's still mad at me.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.848
- You know why.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.282
- Bro, it was a senior prank.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.985
- Man, you smashed his wife.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.987
- On his desk.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.922
- [Both] While the PA was on.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.157
(moaning)

29:20.192 --> 29:23.293
- Oh, I'mma be on
the honor roll now.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.163
- What the!

29:28.968 --> 29:30.434
- Can I get, a swirl.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.670
It's a souvenir.
- I hate that hat.

29:33.706 --> 29:37.007
- Listen, the kid
has gotta wear pants,

29:37.042 --> 29:39.042
that's not up for debate.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.979
(dramatic music)

29:51.423 --> 29:52.456
Coochie king.

29:55.528 --> 29:56.660
Oh, it's on.

30:03.536 --> 30:06.036
- Hey man, why is it so quiet?

30:06.071 --> 30:09.740
- Like, don't nobody
wanna skip class, man.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.175
Yo, Wesley Snipes.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.180
- [Roger] Oh my god.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.016
- Damn, what happened, skirt?
- Poor kid.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.984
Oh my god, what your face?

30:21.020 --> 30:23.020
- Goddamn, these kids.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.188
Oh.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.429
Come on, man, we're
about to get robbed.

30:32.464 --> 30:35.365
You don't wanna
rob us, we broke.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.367
- Would you mind taking
our picture, sir?

30:37.403 --> 30:38.335
- Huh?
- We just got a A

30:38.370 --> 30:41.104
on a science project and
we wanna text our mom.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.339
- Take a picture?

30:42.374 --> 30:44.007
- [Roger] They kids, man.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.075
- Don't you ever reach for
your damn jacket like that,

30:45.110 --> 30:46.543
put your phone in your pocket.

30:46.579 --> 30:49.746
I almost knocked
y'all the **** out.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.458
- Sir.
- Yep.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.026
- He called me sir.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.495
- It's the braids,
I done told you.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.531
You smell that?

31:09.134 --> 31:11.368
- Right here, right here.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.103
Pot, we're going in that door

31:13.138 --> 31:14.371
and we gonna get
them punks, come on.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.216
- Yo, Mr. Crandall.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.784
- Oh, Jesus.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.953
- Can we get high?

31:29.989 --> 31:31.121
- You guys scared
the piss outta me.

31:31.156 --> 31:32.789
Why are you not
on the field trip?

31:32.825 --> 31:33.957
- Boy, that boy high as hell.

31:33.993 --> 31:34.992
You don't remember me?

31:35.027 --> 31:37.227
It's Calvin.
- Roger.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.863
- Hold up, lemme do my move.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.799
- Calvin, yes I remember you.

31:42.835 --> 31:45.102
- What's up!
- You graduated?

31:45.137 --> 31:46.503
- I mean, you know, I
walked across the stage.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.238
- You walked, yeah for sure.
- I was there, you know.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.940
- So what's up?

31:49.975 --> 31:54.177
- We got a little neighborhood
business that, you know,

31:54.213 --> 31:56.580
me and my cousin have
started up, right, you know,

31:56.615 --> 31:58.181
'cause we trying to
change our life around,

31:58.217 --> 32:00.317
'cause I graduated, right?

32:00.352 --> 32:04.087
Some of our business
supplies have been misplaced

32:04.123 --> 32:07.124
and it was brought
to our attention

32:07.159 --> 32:10.160
that some of the people who
might have misplaced them,

32:10.195 --> 32:11.828
they probably go to this school,

32:11.864 --> 32:14.264
so we just wanted to say
hey, you know, speak to 'em.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.832
- So you guys are dealers?

32:15.868 --> 32:16.934
Somebody copped your product.

32:16.969 --> 32:20.037
- The whole stash, man,
they took the whole thing.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.838
And this smells rather familiar.

32:21.874 --> 32:23.874
We was wondering if
you could help us

32:23.909 --> 32:25.375
find out where you got
it, 'cause you know,

32:25.411 --> 32:27.844
it's kinda hard to
come by now, you know?

32:27.880 --> 32:28.812
- You're telling me.

32:28.847 --> 32:31.381
Dealers all over town
are completely sold out.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.116
It's like somebody's
buying in bulk.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.986
Open a friggin' chronic Costco.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.823
Found this canister
earlier in the cafeteria.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.092
I haven't seen it before,

32:42.127 --> 32:45.062
but let me tell you,
it is dank as fudge.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.196
- I smelled it.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.130
- What he say?

32:47.166 --> 32:48.565
- I don't know.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.168
- This smell like angel
farts, this is our stuff.

32:51.203 --> 32:54.304
- Looks like Russians,
talk to Ivanov.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.908
They're in the Magic
Kitty, strip club downtown.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.042
- Russians steal everything.

32:59.078 --> 33:02.379
They done stole our election
and done stolen our weed.

33:02.414 --> 33:06.016
- [McMullen] Calvin, I know
you're in the building.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.317
I found your hat.

33:08.921 --> 33:12.656
If I find you, my friend,
you're going down hard.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.093
- Told you not to wear
that stupid hat, man.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.695
- It's my favorite hat, cuz.

33:18.731 --> 33:21.231
- Sounds like you guys
need this more than I do.

33:21.266 --> 33:24.201
- I do, 'cause I'm going down.
(knocking)

33:24.236 --> 33:25.902
- You homewrecker!

33:27.639 --> 33:28.905
- Here you go.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.641
(energetic music)

33:34.947 --> 33:37.914
- Come on, man, grab me some.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.717
(Calvin and Roger muttering)

33:40.753 --> 33:41.985
The gym, gym.

33:51.463 --> 33:52.362
- Dang.

33:55.467 --> 33:59.436
- I told you if you ever

33:59.471 --> 34:02.272
stepped foot in
this school again

34:05.477 --> 34:07.411
I'd beat you senseless.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.716
- How's our wife?

34:22.293 --> 34:27.264
- That super weed made
you fly, cuz. (laughs)

34:30.002 --> 34:32.436
Dunked on your ass. (laughs)

34:32.471 --> 34:37.274
Uh-oh, what's going on? (yells)

34:37.309 --> 34:39.141
- Come on, man.
- What happened?

34:39.178 --> 34:41.277
What happened to my power?

34:50.322 --> 34:52.322
- [McMullen] Out of the
way, move, move, move.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.255
Calvin!

34:54.159 --> 34:55.058
Damn it.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.162
- [Roger] That was crazy.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.731
That weed got us high for real.

35:05.237 --> 35:08.972
You always got me doing

35:09.007 --> 35:10.006
- Can't believe we alive, cuz.

35:10.042 --> 35:11.374
- Man, get your ass up, man.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.344
- Time to go to the strip club.

35:14.379 --> 35:17.881
Man, can't believe
I lost my hat again.

35:18.951 --> 35:19.850
- Perfect.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.853
- Alicia?

35:22.888 --> 35:24.087
Yo.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.388
- Roger?

35:25.424 --> 35:27.090
- What's up?

35:27.126 --> 35:28.158
- Hey.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.059
- Ha, ha.

35:31.396 --> 35:32.329
- This is my--

35:32.364 --> 35:33.497
- Sorry, I got bugs in my mouth.

35:33.532 --> 35:37.033
My name's Calvin.
- Cousin Calvin.

35:37.069 --> 35:39.369
Anyways, this is where you work?

35:39.404 --> 35:40.370
- Yeah.

35:40.405 --> 35:41.371
- It's dope.

35:42.407 --> 35:45.242
- So are you guys with the kids?

35:45.277 --> 35:50.881
- We um, volunteer chaperone
at the school sometimes.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.186
- Uh, people left their
kids with you guys?

35:56.221 --> 35:57.087
- Yeah.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.256
- What about that?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.257
- I'm just playing.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.092
All right, you guys are
gonna get the full tour,

36:02.127 --> 36:05.428
and don't fall asleep
like you used to in class.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.430
All right guys, my
name's Alicia Harmon

36:07.466 --> 36:09.432
and this is Verdant Biokinetics,

36:09.468 --> 36:12.102
so let's start with my
favorite part of the tour,

36:12.137 --> 36:17.107
employee lounge where there's
free soda and snacks, come on.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.075
- What is you doing?

36:19.111 --> 36:20.944
We ain't got no time
for no full tour.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.546
We ain't got time
for no drinks, Roger.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.315
You forgot, we go to
strip club, the Russian?

36:25.350 --> 36:27.250
- Yo, the booty
club gonna be there.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.418
You see that lady up there?

36:28.453 --> 36:30.287
Yo, just let me
finesse this real quick

36:30.322 --> 36:31.488
and it's gonna be all good.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.991
Plus, she said there's free
soda, so we all Gucci be good.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.327
- Don't nobody give a damn
about no drinks, Roger.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.995
You know what, they better
have liters in there

36:39.031 --> 36:40.263
'cause you sound
thirsty as hell.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.232
- [Roger] Man, shut up.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.002
- Founded in 2013,
Verdant Biokinetics

36:46.038 --> 36:48.438
makes everything
from rocket biofuel

36:48.473 --> 36:50.440
to nutrient-dense baby formula.

36:50.475 --> 36:51.942
- Well, I hope they don't mix up

36:51.977 --> 36:53.510
the baby formula
and the rocket fuel.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.345
Babies gonna be blowing
up all over town.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.014
(Calvin imitates explosion)
(Calvin imitates baby crying)

36:58.050 --> 36:59.950
- We're working to
improve the mind,

36:59.985 --> 37:01.318
the body, and the world.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.986
- [Ana] Hello.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.956
- Oh, and look, there's
our CEO, Miss Ana Cheever.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.958
- Hey, everyone,
sorry to interrupt.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.492
I just want to
say how happy I am

37:09.528 --> 37:11.461
that you're all here
today to be part

37:11.496 --> 37:14.464
of our inner city
youth outreach program.

37:14.499 --> 37:19.102
Alicia is helping us to be
a fully woke corporation.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.972
- [Both] Woke?

37:22.007 --> 37:25.175
- You're all so brave
and so beautiful.

37:26.011 --> 37:29.512
You have such bright,
bright futures ahead of you.

37:29.548 --> 37:33.049
And just remember,
don't do drugs.

37:33.085 --> 37:36.152
Unless, of course, they're
one of ours. (giggles)

37:36.188 --> 37:38.188
I'm kidding, I am kidding.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.390
- Thank you for
that, Miss Cheever.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.491
Let's give it up for her.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.193
- This lady is wack.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.195
I'm finna go find me a
place to smoke, I'm out.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.030
- Why don't we head
into our VR room,

37:47.065 --> 37:48.164
where you guys can fly with bees

37:48.200 --> 37:50.500
through real honeycombs, yeah?

37:53.405 --> 37:55.505
- [System] Access granted.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.188
- You figure it out?

38:12.224 --> 38:15.225
- Oh yeah, you know,
I'm math as hell.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.028
(Alicia laughs)

38:19.131 --> 38:21.231
Yo, so, what
happened to the tour?

38:21.266 --> 38:23.400
- I left them in the auditorium
with a science movie,

38:23.435 --> 38:24.601
so you know, they're probably

38:24.636 --> 38:27.337
all diddling each other by now.

38:27.372 --> 38:29.039
- I like science movies.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.074
- I bet you do.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.275
- What's up with your boss like,

38:32.311 --> 38:36.079
crying about the inner city
kids, dressing like Erykah Badu.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.547
Is she like, serious?

38:37.582 --> 38:39.416
- Yeah, she means well,

38:39.451 --> 38:42.052
but she can just be
a real line-crosser.

38:42.087 --> 38:45.055
That woman stresses me out.

38:45.090 --> 38:49.192
- Word, yo, when I get
like that, yo, I get high.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.396
Yo, I actually got some,
if you wanna smoke?

38:53.432 --> 38:55.398
- I stopped smoking in college.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.366
- For real?

38:56.401 --> 38:58.268
Like, you never smoke?

38:59.171 --> 39:00.370
- I guess, I don't know,

39:00.405 --> 39:02.572
I just started
focusing on my career.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.140
- I feel that, I'm all
about my paper too,

39:04.176 --> 39:07.544
but yo, I gotta smoke,
like I gotsta stay high.

39:07.579 --> 39:11.114
- Well, you're cute,
so you can do that.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.551
(phone vibrates)

39:14.586 --> 39:17.587
See, this is what I'm talking
about, the CEO needs me.

39:17.622 --> 39:20.557
- I'll be here if
you change your mind.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.459
- Shouldn't you
be with the kids?

39:22.494 --> 39:23.593
- Kids, kids.

39:25.297 --> 39:27.230
- Roger, it's this way.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.267
- I knew that.
- Uh-huh.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.636
- Nobody in here.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.272
Time to smoke my blunt.

39:36.308 --> 39:38.274
Ooh, that too hard.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.477
Nobody.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.680
(woman screaming)

39:43.715 --> 39:47.417
- Help me, help me.
- Want me to help you?

39:47.452 --> 39:49.552
Let me take your picture.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.763
- Now, come on here.
- Why you so strong?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.564
Get off, I can walk.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.168
- [Roger] Yo, what's going on?

40:05.203 --> 40:06.336
- Ain't none of
your business, sir.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.771
- It is my business,
he's with me.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.773
- Well then you need
to come with me, too.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.174
Come on, now.
- You snitch.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.276
You're stupid.
- Come on, man, damn.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.211
- Fye is causing
some side effects.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.646
- This is very, very bad.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.215
These results are horrendous.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.718
- Well, should we
delay the launch?

40:21.753 --> 40:24.687
- No, absolutely not, our
stock price would plummet.

40:24.723 --> 40:25.822
- Ow.
- Try it, man.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.624
- [Guard] Sorry to interrupt.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.225
- What is it?

40:29.261 --> 40:30.460
- I found these two
wandering around the halls

40:30.495 --> 40:33.229
and this gentleman was
in a restricted area.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.130
- Who you calling a gentleman?

40:34.166 --> 40:38.368
I am not not gentleman,
I am a grown man.

40:38.403 --> 40:39.836
- What's going on?

40:39.871 --> 40:42.305
- These two claim to
be with the high school

40:42.340 --> 40:45.542
but none of the other chaperones
has ever heard of 'em.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.710
They say they're with you?

40:47.746 --> 40:49.312
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.715
Yep, I'm taking
them to lunch today.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.484
They're actually
community leaders.

40:54.519 --> 40:57.854
- Oh, community
leaders, wonderful.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.489
- Calvin, Roger.

40:59.524 --> 41:03.326
- Yeah, it's Officer Community
Leader Calvin at that.

41:03.361 --> 41:04.727
And Obama was a
community leader.

41:04.763 --> 41:05.728
- I miss Obama.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.363
- He was a deacon at his church.

41:07.399 --> 41:08.331
- We're gonna go.

41:08.366 --> 41:09.499
- Take them to Chez Jane,

41:09.534 --> 41:10.600
it's the best soul
food in Atlanta.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.768
It's on us.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.703
- He only liked brown
M&M's, did you know.

41:13.738 --> 41:16.239
- Thank you so much,
love you brothers.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.209
know what I'm saying,
giving us a ride

41:19.244 --> 41:21.044
back to the whip and all that.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.412
- Are you kidding
me, you just gave me

41:22.447 --> 41:24.881
an excuse to get
out of the office.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.049
Let's go get that lunch
I just lied about.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.985
- Uh-uh, we ain't
got time, ma'am.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.854
We're kinda in a rush.

41:30.889 --> 41:34.090
Have you ever eaten
at Magic Kitty?

41:34.125 --> 41:35.225
- Yo, he's kidding.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.827
We should go to
Zaxby's or something.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.730
- Well if you want the best
wings, you go to Magic Kitty.

41:40.765 --> 41:42.398
Let's go see some booty.

41:42.434 --> 41:44.234
- Okay but look, there's a
reason we gotta go, okay?

41:44.269 --> 41:46.769
- We gotta go see some
Russian gangsters, okay?

41:46.805 --> 41:49.873
They stole our weed and we
ain't really got a plan.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.774
And you can die.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.076
- Okay, well as long
as I'm not eating

41:53.111 --> 41:54.544
a boring-ass salad
bowl at the mall,

41:54.579 --> 41:57.981
I'm down for whatever,
Calvin, let's go.

41:59.484 --> 42:03.419
- You said you
want a ride or die.

42:03.455 --> 42:06.923
So that's what we're into,
people that just wanna die?

I got money.

42:58.009 --> 43:01.578
(mumbles) Popcorn playa.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.146
- Nigga just made it rain on me.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.314

I ain't want no dance.

43:23.034 --> 43:25.001

looking for Ivanov.

43:25.036 --> 43:27.637
- Yes, and tell him
when you see him

43:27.672 --> 43:31.107
I need to talk to him,
the boss is here. (barks)

43:31.142 --> 43:33.176
- He is not a he.

43:33.211 --> 43:36.045
- [Calvin] What you

43:36.081 --> 43:38.314

43:50.562 --> 43:52.328
- Okay, let's hear it.

43:52.364 --> 43:55.565
Why are you coming in here
and disrespecting my business?

43:55.600 --> 43:58.001
- No, what's disrespectful
is you're stealing our weed

43:58.036 --> 43:59.569
and passing it off
like it's your own.

43:59.604 --> 44:02.238

44:02.273 --> 44:04.540
I'mma calm down when y'all

44:04.576 --> 44:06.142
- We don't steal weed.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.011
You are wasting my time.

44:08.046 --> 44:09.178
Bogdan, get rid of them.

44:09.214 --> 44:11.214
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not

Hey, this is my design.

45:16.114 --> 45:18.047
He say, "I want cool
Russian tattoo."

45:18.083 --> 45:21.284
But **** this guy, so

45:21.319 --> 45:24.220
He must like, he

45:24.255 --> 45:26.222

45:31.463 --> 45:32.662
Pussy cat.

45:32.697 --> 45:35.665
- South Atlanta
College, right, yeah.

45:35.700 --> 45:37.433
- I think we're going

45:37.469 --> 45:39.135
- You're not going anywhere.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.636
- Okay.
- Oh.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.639

45:48.446 --> 45:49.412
I want her.

45:50.448 --> 45:51.748

45:51.783 --> 45:55.251

45:55.286 --> 45:56.786
I want to see you dance.

45:56.821 --> 45:59.789
- [Bogdan] I would

45:59.824 --> 46:02.291
- [Irena] You work for me now.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.130

46:07.165 --> 46:09.165

46:47.539 --> 46:49.806
Come on, y'all.

46:51.409 --> 46:53.242

46:59.517 --> 47:01.184
Girl, what was you

47:01.219 --> 47:03.085
- [Alicia] You said

47:03.121 --> 47:07.390
- [Roger] We didn't say kick
the Russian in the head.

47:20.572 --> 47:23.206
(upbeat music)

47:32.917 --> 47:35.051
- [Calvin] Ooh, damn, girl.

47:35.086 --> 47:37.854

47:37.889 --> 47:39.755

47:39.791 --> 47:41.357
Like, if you need

47:41.392 --> 47:42.792
or whatever you were doing,

47:42.827 --> 47:44.927
me and my cousin, really,

47:44.963 --> 47:48.264
- I can't go, I literally
can't go back to work today.

47:48.299 --> 47:49.966
I'm high as hell.

47:50.001 --> 47:52.768
- Which one of these students
do you think smoke weed?

47:52.804 --> 47:53.936
- All these kids smoke weed,

47:53.972 --> 47:56.372
you're gonna have
to talk to them.

47:56.407 --> 47:59.375
Just gotta know

47:59.410 --> 48:04.046
Football players, which one

48:05.817 --> 48:06.916
Damn.

48:06.951 --> 48:08.351
I didn't name it.

48:11.823 --> 48:13.256
I didn't name it!

48:16.027 --> 48:17.927
- All right, it can't be
that hard to find a kid

48:17.962 --> 48:21.397
who smokes weed on
a college campus.

48:21.432 --> 48:24.066
- I think I know somebody.

48:24.102 --> 48:26.002
- Uh-uh, follow my cuz.

48:26.037 --> 48:29.739
(camera shutter clicking)

48:30.842 --> 48:34.977
- Well, well, well, if it
ain't Robbin' and Stealin'.

48:35.013 --> 48:37.747
- Nah, it's Meegan and Steffi.

48:38.483 --> 48:41.918
- Oh, hey, Zesto's,

48:41.953 --> 48:43.419
what's up?
- Oh.

48:43.454 --> 48:45.421
- Sorry about what
happened the other night.

48:45.456 --> 48:46.989
- [Meegan] Hey, didn't
you get our apology joint?

48:47.025 --> 48:49.959
- Yeah, I got it,

48:51.062 --> 48:52.695
But it don't even
matter right now,

48:52.730 --> 48:55.798
y'all need to tell me right

48:55.833 --> 48:56.799
- Right now.

48:59.737 --> 49:01.003
- We don't smoke weed.

49:01.039 --> 49:02.338
- Are you serious?

49:02.373 --> 49:03.839
You're gonna tell
me that right now?

49:03.875 --> 49:05.374
With a straight face, after

59:04.408 --> 59:06.141
- What is he doing?

59:17.922 --> 59:21.290
(Alicia gasps)
- What?

59:25.930 --> 59:27.362
- What happened?

59:29.233 --> 59:30.532
I smell dookie.

59:30.568 --> 59:32.000
- You don't need to
worry about that.

59:32.036 --> 59:33.135
Uh-huh, did y'all see that?

59:33.170 --> 59:35.971
Did you see that, did you
saw that masterpiece, huh?

59:36.006 --> 59:36.939
We ain't playing no games,

59:36.974 --> 59:39.575
no telling what we do
when our powers kick in.

59:39.610 --> 59:43.879
- Yo, that's not our
Weed Bible, look at this.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.547
- [Calvin] Kama
Sutra for Small Men?

59:45.583 --> 59:46.481
- Give me my book back.

59:46.517 --> 59:47.583
- Oh.
- Whoa.

59:47.618 --> 59:49.651
- She be hitting
you from the back?

59:49.687 --> 59:51.253
- That's normal.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.488
- What you got going on, what
kinda fraternity is this?

59:54.458 --> 59:55.924
- Where's our Weed Bible?

59:55.960 --> 59:58.894
- I don't know what that
is, I just bought your weed.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.662
Some dude sold it
to me for cheap.

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.331
- What dude?

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:06.902
- I don't know, some dude
going on about a booty cloud.

01:00:07.504 --> 01:00:09.338
- [Calvin And Roger] Big Bang.

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:11.540
- [Calvin] He can have that.

01:00:12.476 --> 01:00:17.546
- Now we smoke our finest
brother's ashes in his memory.

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:23.018
- [Ghost] Thetas.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.019
- Oh.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:28.290
- I guess smoking dead
people really works.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:32.227
- What's up, negros? (laughs)

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:39.401
in downtown Atlanta,
brought to you by Fye.

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:43.005
It's the future of high,
it's Fye, launching tomorrow.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.040
- [Radio DJ] I know
everybody's excited about that.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.014
- Trap house, there's
so many wonderful things

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:55.384
I could say about you,
but I don't feel like it.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.586
- Big Bang, where's
our Weed Bible?

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.621
- What, what you talking about?

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:02.424
- We know you got it,
because Tobin told us.

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:03.625
- So Tobin told you
I had the bible,

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:05.560
so just 'cause Tobin told you
something, you believe Tobin?

01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:06.695
- Where the bible at?

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.463
- Okay, all right,
yeah, I got it.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:09.631
All right, I sold him some weed

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.433
and I ain't got
none of the rest,

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:12.934
and I ain't got your bible no
more, either, sold that too.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.436
- To who?

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:15.504
- I don't know,
some white people.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:16.204
White people wanna buy
stuff, you sell it to 'em.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.440
Some company called (stutters)

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:20.575
- Verdant Biokinetics?

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:21.743
- That, say it again.

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.445
- Verdant Biokinetics.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.579
- Yeah, that's them
right there, man.

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:26.381
They were all in
a panic to get it.

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:27.749
They almost ripped my
arm apart, some of 'em.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:28.917
We all need it, we all need it.

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:32.054
And they paid me a lot of
money, that's how I'm retiring.

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:34.556
Big Bang outta here, ha, bang.

01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:36.758
- What would a big tech
lab want with our weed?

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.593
- I don't know, they said
they gonna make some like,

01:01:38.629 --> 01:01:40.062
smart blunt, that's
what it was called.

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.964
Fye, and it was fye,
too, they let me try it.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.966
It was amazing, nice clean burn,

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:47.469
fruity flavors, I
think it's the future.

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:50.072
Although the comedown, it's
a little bad, little shaky,

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:52.474
but hey, more weed
better than no weed,

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:53.408
you know what I'm saying?

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:55.510
And they white people,
why not trust 'em?

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:57.979
- And you ain't know
nothing about this?

01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:00.015
- I know they've been developing
something for a while now,

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.651
but I don't know what that has
to do with your Weed Bible.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:05.654
- Grow house, the Weed Bible,

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.590
how you even know
about all that?

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.128
- Man, I've been banging
your mama for months now.

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:14.529
(Alicia gasps)

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:16.498
I saw everything.

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.433
(Roger's mom moaning)

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:20.035
- Bro, who up there
smashing yo mama, bro?

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.105
- I don't know and I don't
wanna know, man, turn this up.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.507
- [Roger's Mom] Ooh
baby, look at him.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.142
- Turn up the TV, man, come on.

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:28.510
I don't wanna hear that.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:30.712
- Bang, bang, bang, bang,

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:32.514
bang.
- That was you?

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:33.682
- Man, don't act so surprised.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.784
I done told you a million times.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:37.686
- I thought those were
just yo mama jokes.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:39.721
Wait, so, you taught
me how to ride a bike.

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:42.524
It was at my fifth
birthday party.

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:43.658
Are you my daddy?

01:02:43.694 --> 01:02:45.460
- Hell no, I ain't
your daddy, boy.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:46.661
- Thank god.
- Look at me.

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.530
- He's got a point,
he got light skin

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:49.531
and you black as hell.

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:50.465
- I was just being nice to you.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:51.533
That's what you do,
you be nice to the kid

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.703
to get close to the mama,
and she let me hit it.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:56.738
- [Roger's Mom] I heard that.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.807
- Damn, your mama
got some ears on her.

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:00.742
- [Roger And Calvin] We know.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.145
- There she is, baby, ha!

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.547
So fine walking
down those stairs.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.549
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, baby.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:08.550
You smell good.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:09.751
- I know.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:13.755
Roger, listen, I told Bang to
get your butt out that gang.

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.056
- Had to do it.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:16.525
- And you, ooh.

01:03:17.728 --> 01:03:18.693
- Did I do good,

01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:20.729
did I do?
- You did good, baby.

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:22.130
Ooh!
- Oh my god.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.167
Mom, I can't unsee
stuff like that.

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:27.068
- Unsee this too.

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:31.540
(Roger's mom
shrieking excitedly)

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:32.707
You want to see it again?
- No, I don't want

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:33.875
to see it ever.
- I got tapes.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:35.177
You should see the other stuff.

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:36.678
- Bang, why am I still carrying

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:37.646
this darn suitcase?
- I don't know,

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:39.214
but you shouldn't carry
nothing but my heart.

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:40.715
- And where's that whip of yours

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:42.717
you keep telling me about,
it's a quarter past.

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.553
- Bang, there it is
right there, look at it.

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:47.189
- Ooh, we done came up, baby.

01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:49.524
- Bang ain't playing
no games, got to go.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.058
- Open my door for me, honey.

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:51.193
- [Big Bang] I will.

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.761
- I'll be back in two weeks.

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:55.597
Don't you drink up
all my Fanta, boy.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:57.098
Hey Daddy, honey.
- You get in there, sweetie.

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:59.634
- Oh, lemme get in here, ooh.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:00.735
Get in, baby.

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:03.238
Work that thing, babe.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:04.606
- Bye, bitches.

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:05.607
We rolling.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:10.579
- Wow, so that's that.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:15.083
- So um, this is
where you guys live?

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.619
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:18.520
- Okay.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.255
- If Big Bang took
our bible and sold it

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.823
to that tech company,
I'm thinking,

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:23.124
let's just go get it back.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.793
I mean, Alicia, you
work there, right?

01:04:24.828 --> 01:04:26.228
So I'm sure it's no
problem with getting

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.763
the CEO to hear us out, right?

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:32.634
- Well, hold on, guys.

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:33.768
Today's been...

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:36.771
I don't even know what today's
been, but I can't do that.

01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:40.242
We're talking about my job
here, my whole career, no.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:41.643
- So now you're
a corporate girl.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:42.811
Thought that place
stressed you out.

01:04:42.846 --> 01:04:43.912
- Yeah well Roger, no offense,

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:44.913
but you wouldn't
know the first thing

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:46.248
about holding down a job.

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.649
- Yeah, I wouldn't know

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:48.183
the first thing, huh.
- I worked my ass off

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.651
to get to where I am,

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.152
and I put it all on
the line for you today.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:53.688
- Just 'cause you work
at some big fancy job,

01:04:53.724 --> 01:04:55.257
that don't mean you
better than anybody.

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:56.925
I ain't no bum.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.859
- Okay, well why don't you just

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.261
say what you really mean, then.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:01.263
- What I'm saying is,
you look real strange

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.698
working for them people
that stole our stuff.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:05.166
I'm just trying to figure
out what side you're on,

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:09.137
'cause right now you're
looking like the feds.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:14.910
- Okay, what I'm not
gonna do is this, so bye.

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:16.978
- Bye.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:18.713

Why aren't you smoking
your little Fye?

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:48.910
- I'm sorry, can I help you?

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:53.648
Oh, you're Alicia's
community guys, supposedly.

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:54.983
- Yeah, and that's our weed.

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:56.718
- Oh, well congratulations.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:57.919
My complements to the chef.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.221
This is the best
weed I've ever had.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:02.857
You're doing a service
to your community.

01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:04.693
My assistant got
this off the streets,

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.261
he got your little
cookbook, too.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.896
So there won't be
any more of this.

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:09.831
- So you got our Weed Bible.

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:12.934
- Through a subcontractor,
so it's all legit.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.870
- Big Bang is not no
damn subcontractor, okay?

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:17.839
He stole that from
us, it's not legit.

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:20.742
- Oh, that sounds
like a you problem.

01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:22.777
(car horn honks)
Sorry, my ride is here.

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:25.013
My assistant, Hayes.

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:28.350
- Hayes, how could you
do this to us, bruh?

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.385
- Sorry, bruh, I'm
up for a promotion.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.753
- I should've dropped
your ass home.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:33.755
- You should've binbied his ass.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.757
- Oh, we didn't
just buy your weed.

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:37.359
We bought everybody's weed

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:40.395
and what we couldn't
buy, we just took.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.964
So the town is thirsty now,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.901
and guess who has the
cool, refreshing answer?

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:49.704
Fye.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.972
- Man, what you know about Fye?

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:53.308
- Oh, well according to
the Urban Dictionary,

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:58.913
fye is slang for fire,
as in, Fye is on fire.

01:06:58.949 --> 01:07:00.949
- Yo, I knew all that
woke **** was fake.

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:01.916
- Who me, fake?

01:07:01.952 --> 01:07:05.387
Oh believe me, I am 100% woke.

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:08.390
You should be thanking me,
I did you people a favor.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.791
- You people?

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.426
- Fye has all the
benefits of marijuana

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:14.763
while speaking to
the modern consumer.

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:19.401
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, syncs all
your contacts, and it's legal.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:22.070
There isn't gonna be a stoner
in Atlanta without one,

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:24.339
and then the rest
of the country.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.809
Dealers go to jail,
but I'm gonna be rich.

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:29.944
- I knew you was a
snake woman, I knew it.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.813
- Damn braids, man.

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:34.015
- Aw, sorry, not sorry.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.950
I have a launch
to get ready for.

01:07:35.986 --> 01:07:38.787
Fye is the future of relaxation.

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:42.857
Here gentlemen, try some.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:45.026
Much love, brothers.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.828
(Calvin muttering angrily)

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:48.863
- Fire her ass up.

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.098
- [Ana] Let's go, Hayes.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.808
- Yo man, I just
can't catch a break.

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:01.976
It don't make no sense.

01:08:02.012 --> 01:08:04.946
- Man, to be honest,
cuz, forget the weed,

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:07.148
forget the Bible, we might
as well just start over,

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:09.984
get a brand new hustle.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.954
- Nah man, I'm tired of
starting over with you.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:14.055
It don't work.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:15.790
We wouldn't even be selling weed

01:08:15.826 --> 01:08:18.725
if you would've just
showed up at the bank, dog.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.863
- Man, I been hustling to
help you with your dreams.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:23.965
I don't give a damn
about no snacks.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.701
I'm just trying to be
a good cousin, bruh.

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:27.836
And you know what, you
gonna stop blaming me

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:33.006
for all your problems that
go wrong in your life, man.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:35.009
- I know you're not
finna smoke that.

01:08:35.045 --> 01:08:37.011
- Oh, this getting smoked.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.520
(Roger snoring)

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.924
- [Fly Girl] Shoot, my
wig goddamn came off.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.794
- Boy, you need to
clean this room up.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.895
- Yo, look at Roger
over here sleeping.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.698
Waste our time, let's get him.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.868
- Baby Powder, what the
hell you doing here?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.537
- We heard about the Bible.

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:03.904
- [Fly Girl] Mm-hmm.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:07.709
- I did what you said
but it's gone now.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.944
- It's gone.
- I let y'all down.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.647
- You didn't let us down.

01:09:12.682 --> 01:09:13.881
You let the people down.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:14.883
- The people.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.651
- You screwed up.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.886
I oughta knock the
green juice outta--

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.587
- Thanks.

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.657
That was helping me a lot,
making me feel better.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:23.925
- Let me explain
something to you,

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.926
see the Europeans--
- School him.

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.895
- They took the weed
and they gentrified it.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.564
- The saltine crackers.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:30.732
- They came in and mixed it up,

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:31.933
put their own bells
and whistles on it,

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:33.734
man, and made it they own.

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.904
- You listening?
- And you gotta stop them.

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:37.572
- How?

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:39.974
The weed you gave me
gave me superpowers, man.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.511
Without that, I'm just
a broke-ass stoner.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:44.612
- Yeah, that's true.
- Boy, that weed

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.814
didn't give you no superpowers.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.816
- Boy, you not a
part of the Avengers.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.952
Ain't no Black
Panther up in you.

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:52.587
(Baby Powder growls)

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:53.587
But he right.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.556
- But how?

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.492
I don't understand.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:58.893
- You were just high.

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:01.796
None of that **** was real other
than what you was thinking.

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:04.933
- [Fly Girl] Boy,
just think about it.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:11.673
(McMullen groans)

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:12.974
- [Calvin] Goddamn!

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.912
(speaking in foreign language)

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:28.823
- [Baby Powder] That weed
ain't get you no superpowers.

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.593
- What the hell's he doing?

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:35.830
- All that other **** that
you thought was happening,

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:37.799
that wasn't real.
- Duh.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.968
- Yes, you were just high.
- Just high.

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:42.837
- The point is,
it's not the weed,

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.839
it's you.
- It's you.

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:46.641
- This is your destiny, boy.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.876
- It's your job Kool-Aid head.

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:49.978
Save the weed.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:53.681
- [Both] Save the weed.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.017
- Save the weed, wait.

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:58.886
Wait, hold up, if the
power wasn't real,

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.989
how am I talking to
y'all two right now.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:01.889
- Oh.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.826
- You not talking to us.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:06.828
It's all in your imagination.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.763
You're sitting on
the couch high.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:10.999
You smoked 30 blunts, you bum.

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:13.668
- You bum.
- Come on with it.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.069
Come on, come on.
- Ooh yeah, it's time.

01:11:15.105 --> 01:11:16.070
- Come on.
- It's time.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.672
- Yeah.
- Get him.

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:18.906
- Let it fly.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:19.874
- Ha ha!

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:24.912
- Damn.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.914
- Hey cuz, did a
gorilla in a cowboy hat

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.049
come talk to you, too?

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:30.084
- What, no, Baby Powder did.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.786
- What he say?

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:34.055
- He said we need to stop
Ana and save the weed.

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:35.790
What the gorilla say?

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.859
- I don't know, he
was speaking Japanese,

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:39.894
but you know what,
Baby Powder is right.

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:43.097
We gotta stop her ASAP, cuz,
'cause I smoked that Fye.

01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:44.899
- What happened?

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.868
(Calvin blabbers)

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.736

- Thank for coming out.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.118
- We really need
your help getting

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.986
to the press event tonight.

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:14.789
- Oh, so you just came
here to ask me for help?

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:15.890
You're not gonna
apologize for anything

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:17.825
that you said the other day?

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.727
- You called me a bum.

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:20.962
- Actually, you
called yourself that,

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:23.030
but if the shoe fits,
sweetie, wear it.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.799
- Shoe fits.
- Uh-huh.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:25.933
- Yo, I'm sorry.

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:28.336
Did you know your boss the
one who dried out Atlanta?

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:32.306
- Shh, you know how paranoid
you sound right now?

01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:34.342
Maybe you should stop
smoking so much weed.

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:36.310
- I'm serious, she did
it so she could sell

01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:38.413

without competition.

01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:41.182

- [Calvin] Uh, C.
King, thank you.

01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:10.872
- [Roger] D. Nuhz.

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.377
- [Announcer] Now,
please welcome

01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:18.913
our founder and
CEO, Ana Cheever.

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:21.916
(audience cheering)

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.554
- All right, thank you, yeah.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.893
All right, all right, yeah.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:36.831
Did you like what you saw?

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:37.899
You like it?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.301
Okay, okay.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.639
Marijuana is a problem
in our community,

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:49.644
and making weed legal
is not the solution,

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:52.914
but replacing it with
something better, cleaner,

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:56.784
and safer is a solution,
and we've done just that.

01:15:56.819 --> 01:15:58.619
And it is Fye.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:01.656
(audience cheering)

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:05.793
- All the weed in Atlanta
is hidden somewhere

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.862
in this building and
we gotta find it.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.031
- Don't even trip, I
already got somebody on it.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:11.332
- My cousin.

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:14.402
(suspenseful music)

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.013
(man yells)

01:16:26.049 --> 01:16:28.616
- [Quenton] Attack your ass.

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:37.358
- [Ana] Now, when I
started my company

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:40.962
back in my dorm at my
women's liberal arts college

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:42.830
where I studied--

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:45.967
- Uh, get your ass
back, thanks.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:50.738
- Let's do this.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:51.906
- You got it, babe.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.074
- Babe?

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.375
She called me babe,
she called me babe.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.844
- I heard, I heard.

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:59.747
- Other than that,
my vision never--

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.849
(man grunts)

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:05.186
Technology bring
the world together.

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:09.690
Oh, that is not part
of the presentation.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:11.192
Technical difficulties.

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:13.894
Can we get this fixed, please?

01:17:15.031 --> 01:17:16.130
- Thanks, Ana.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:20.101
Hi everyone, my name is Calvin

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.869
and this here is
my cousin, Roger.

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:25.039
- Uh my mic, can you get
my mic back on, please?

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:28.175
- And we came here
today to stop Verdant

01:17:28.211 --> 01:17:30.945
from destroying
one of the greatest

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.848
American institutions,
marijuana.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:37.218
- Can we get security
up here, please?

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:38.219
- Check it out.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.221
I don't believe this.

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:41.789
- Get it in there.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:42.823
- Oh.

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:46.027
- [Quenton] Child,
you oughta see

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:47.962
all the weed they got in there.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.897
- That's at least a gram.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:51.932
- Weed is not the problem.
- Talk to 'em, cousin.

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:54.235
- The man is the problem.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.904
Actually, in this
case, the woman--

01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:58.906
(Ana gasps)

01:17:58.941 --> 01:17:59.907
Y'all women.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:03.044
- Security, please?

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:04.712
Security, please?

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:08.783
- Yo, we're dying out
here, we need that smoke.

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:10.284
- Hey Jasper, how much longer?

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:12.253
- A goddamn rush job
like this (mumbles)

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:15.089
Gotta get it right, the
weed gotta be (mumbles)

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:17.158
Talking about, you feel me?

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:18.893
- Uh, two minutes?

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:22.930
- Weed is natural, okay?

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:25.132
It's not some machine that
you could just plug up

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:29.103
into the wall to get
a charge up, no, no.

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:31.138
This woman over here is turning

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:34.108
y'all into junkies for profit.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:35.476
Fye is not fly.

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:38.079
Look what it did to me.

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:40.948
(audience shrieking)

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:42.083
- [Ana] I had nothing
to do with it.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.517
- [Calvin] Look at it.

01:18:43.553 --> 01:18:47.021
Yes, weed coming from my
nipple, this is what Fye did.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:48.956
- I told you not
to smoke that ****.

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:53.961
- Bro, my nipples be
leaking, bro. (screams)

01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:55.963
- [Jasper] Move the meat,

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.298
boy that goddamn meat
better move, boy.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:02.269
The goddamn smoke gotta
goddamn fill up (mumbles)

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.606
- [Calvin] Real weed.

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:07.108
- [Roger And Calvin] Real weed.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:08.008
- Come on, y'all.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.110
- [Roger And Calvin] Real weed.

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:10.144
(Calvin screams)

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.146
- Real weed, real.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:15.082
(Calvin grunting)

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.023
- Let's get back to the
presentation, shall we?

01:19:23.059 --> 01:19:26.127
- Hold up, there's
something very important

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:30.297
I want you guys to all
know about my boss,

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:34.235
the wonderful, caring,
community-minded,

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:37.171
super woke CEO.

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:39.006
- Alicia, thank you,
finally someone's

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:41.542
talking some sense around here.

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:42.710
- My friend Calvin there,

01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:46.013
he actually recorded something
that you guys should see,

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.983
so let's just go
ahead and hit it.

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:51.986
Oh, oh no.

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:55.055
Wait, no, no, no.

01:19:56.192 --> 01:19:57.892
Okay, all right.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:19:59.860
- Oh, we didn't
just buy your weed.

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:01.195
We bought everybody's weed,

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:04.031
and what we couldn't
buy, well, we took that.

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:05.032
Well, we took that.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:06.367
Took that.

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:10.571
And guess what, the cool
refreshing answer is Fye.

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.874
Me, a fake?

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:16.377
I assure you, I am 100% woke.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:20.948
Dealers go to jail,
but I'm gonna be rich.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.050
You should thank me, I
did you people a favor.

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:24.218
(audience gasping)

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:27.188
Thank me, I did
you people a favor.

01:20:28.224 --> 01:20:31.192
- You see, and my friends
Calvin and Roger here,

01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:33.194
they're the ones that
tried to stop her.

01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:34.295
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.399
(audience applauds)
(audience boos)

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:41.135
- Hey man, get off me and go
arrest a white woman for once.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.303
Get off of me.

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.071
- You know what,
I'm just gonna go.

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:46.140
- [Calvin] Why's y'all
waiting, you didn't wait on me.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.642
(audience applauds)

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.144
- Real weed!

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:54.348
- [All] Real weed, real
weed, real weed, real weed.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.618
- [Announcer] Now, to
celebrate the return of weed,

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:28.135
- Yo, Cecil dude,

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:29.470
- Just in here starving, bro.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.305
So you still out here
tryna scrounge around

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.873

01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:35.242
- Nah man, actually
I own 2 Smacked, bro.

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:36.477
- Word.
- Yeah, we just closed

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:37.778
another round of financing,

01:23:37.813 --> 01:23:39.480
putting our value
over 150 million.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.249
That's my whip right there.

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:43.550
- That's you?
- Yeah, man.

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:45.486
- Wow, why you out here
delivering the food?

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.454
- Ah, I just like staying
connected to the customer.

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:49.490
You're the customer,
I'm staying connected.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.492
You're my last drop before
we go somewhere special.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:55.295
My girl just got upgraded to
VP, so she earned a raise.
