02:42.371 --> 02:44.331
Mr. Cash?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.792
M... Mr. Cash?

02:49.253 --> 02:51.004
Mr. Cash.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.548
J.R.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.760
J.R., turn it off and get to sleep.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.430
Change it, J.R. Turn it off.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.981
Guess which Carter that is.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.402
- Anita?
- Nope. June.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.571
<i>That was 10-year-old June singing.</i>

03:15.779 --> 03:17.281
<i>What was the name</i>
<i>of that number?</i>

03:17.739 --> 03:18.782
<i>I was gonna sing...</i>

03:18.991 --> 03:21.994
Turn it off.
Do I have to come in there?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.704
<i>Now here's the cut...</i>

03:25.247 --> 03:26.582
Let's get to bed.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.054
It's hot.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.391
It's gonna be hotter tomorrow.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.270
Maybe Daddy will quit us early
and we can go fishing.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.481
We'll go fishing Saturday.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.527
Daddy needs a good day
from us tomorrow, J.R.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.738
I know.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.076
- Jack?
- Mm-hm?

04:06.205 --> 04:08.207
How come you're so good?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.127
I ain't.

04:14.213 --> 04:17.841
- You pick five times more than me.
- Well, I'm bigger than you are.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.470
You know every story in Scripture.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.640
Well, you know every song
in Mama's hymnal.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.600
Songs are easy.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.810
They ain't for me.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.231
There's more words in the Bible
<i>than in Heavenly Highway Hymns.</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:35.150
Look, J.R., if I'm gonna be
a preacher one day...

04:35.317 --> 04:37.361
...I gotta know the Bible
front to back.

04:37.528 --> 04:41.198
I mean, you can't help nobody
if you can't tell them the right story.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.210
They said by noon it's gonna be 104.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.172
Them radio stations say anything
to get them niggers off.

04:58.257 --> 05:01.593
Ray, why don't you let J.R.
Take the babies in?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.429
I told Rollins
we'd have a crop yesterday.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.307
What do I say when he pulls up here
and we're shy?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.268
You ready to unload that piano?

05:10.519 --> 05:13.021
We're not selling Daddy's piano.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.150
And I'm not the one in Bardstown
drinking every Saturday.

05:23.323 --> 05:29.413
<i>Am I a soldier of the cross</i>

05:29.580 --> 05:33.500
<i>A follower of the Lamb</i>

05:33.709 --> 05:39.131
<i>And shall I fear to own His cause</i>

05:46.763 --> 05:49.474
Eh, what's up, doc?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.081
Whoa.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.302
Hey, what did that...? That rooster
say when he was all blown up...

06:25.511 --> 06:28.931
...by TNT and picking his feathers up
outside that henhouse?

06:29.890 --> 06:34.061
"Fortunately, boy, I keep my feathers
numbered for just such an emergency."

07:09.930 --> 07:11.890
I got it. I got it.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.814
Can we go soon?

07:18.981 --> 07:22.234
Mr. Coles gave me a dollar
to cut the whole pile and not half.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.738
Go on ahead, J.R. Catch a fish.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.664
<i>Put a worm on a hook</i>

07:37.749 --> 07:40.544
<i>And drop it in a brook</i>

07:42.880 --> 07:45.340
<i>If things go right</i>

07:47.759 --> 07:50.220
<i>You'll fry some fish tonight</i>

08:09.448 --> 08:12.159
Where you been? Where you been?

08:14.161 --> 08:17.789
Throw that pole down. Get in the car.
In the car.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.992
You hear them, J. R?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.204
Do you hear them angels?

08:57.371 --> 09:00.082
I can hear them, Jack.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.543
They're so beautiful.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.795
They're beautiful.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.464
Jack?

09:07.631 --> 09:09.174
Do something.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.720
Do something.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.413
You know what that is, J. R?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.749
- You know what that is...?
- Stop it, Ray.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.042
Nothing.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.013
Nothing. That's what that is.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.682
That's what that's worth.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.684
And that's what you are.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.229
Leave him alone, Ray. He didn't do this.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.148
The devil did this.
He took the wrong son.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.569
Stop it, Ray.
He was my best. Now he's gone.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.363
Jack, please don't leave me alone.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.614
Ray.
Quiet!

10:55.781 --> 10:59.034
Stop it...
Quiet! Everybody, quiet!

11:09.628 --> 11:10.921
You're gonna miss your bus.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.769
How come they put "John"
on there, J. R?

11:25.978 --> 11:28.564
Your name's J.R., not John.

11:28.772 --> 11:32.401
Letters don't cut it in the Air Force,
Reba. They told me to pick a name.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.864
Communist troops
<i>have been driven out of Seoul...</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:39.741
<i>... by U.S. Forces,</i>
<i>led by General Douglas MacArth...</i>

11:41.285 --> 11:44.371
Oh. What's that?

11:46.540 --> 11:51.211
- Anybody seen Tommy? Hey.
- He's leaving, Ray. Come on.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.507
Now, don't start crying, Mama.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.928
- Be careful with that rifle, J.R.
- Yeah, I will, Mama.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.140
Last month that Purvis boy
got confused and shot himself.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.809
Ain't gonna be no battles, Carrie.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.812
He's going to Germany.
The war is in Korea.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.107
I love you.
- Love you too.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.568
Take this.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.033
Thanks, Mama.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.620
Take care of yourself, Donzil.
Take care of my sister too.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.538
I will.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.791
Hey, Tommy? Be a good boy.

12:34.630 --> 12:38.133
- You're gonna miss your bus.
- Yeah.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.253
Excuse me. May I?

14:49.389 --> 14:52.100
"Dear Vivian, I really miss you.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.561
Boo hoo hoo."

14:54.895 --> 14:56.772
It don't matter what you write, Cash.

14:56.980 --> 15:01.610
No chassis like that's gonna stay parked
in her daddy's driveway for two years.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.419
Cash.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.588
Write something.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.070
I saw this church in DÃ¼sseldorf
made of limestone.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.613
Big as a train station.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.074
We can get married there
and go to Venice.

15:49.283 --> 15:54.079
That's in Italy, Viv. The streets
are made of water. I ain't kidding.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.164
<i>Johnny...</i>

15:56.331 --> 15:58.750
<i>I haven't seen you for two years.</i>

15:59.668 --> 16:02.421
<i>We only dated for a month.</i>

16:02.963 --> 16:06.550
<i>My daddy says there's</i>
<i>something wrong with you.</i>

16:06.758 --> 16:10.179
Well, what do you say, Viv?

16:11.180 --> 16:14.349
<i>I mean, I thought you said</i>
<i>you loved me.</i>

16:14.558 --> 16:18.395
I do. Oh, I do. I...

16:19.021 --> 16:21.523
<i>Well, then don't be scared.</i>
<i>You tell him that.</i>

16:21.690 --> 16:25.110
<i>- You tell him I love you too.</i>
- He says that's impossible.

16:25.319 --> 16:29.198
- He says that you hardly know me.
- I think I know perfect when I meet it.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.200
Let's go, Cash.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.077
Viv...

16:34.411 --> 16:37.164
Listen, baby. You tell your daddy
I'm your man.

16:37.331 --> 16:40.834
Tell him we'll make a family, and I'm
gonna be on the radio because I am.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.754
You tell him we'll have a nice house,
and we'll be happy.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.548
We'll live in Memphis.
Tell him I'll love you forever.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.593
<i>- You promise?</i>
- That's a promise, Viv. You hear me...?

16:50.010 --> 16:53.055
Five minutes was up
five minutes ago.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.398
<i>I am Folsom Prison.</i>

17:03.524 --> 17:06.902
<i>At one time they called me</i>
<i>Bloody Folsom.</i>

17:07.444 --> 17:10.531
<i>And I earned the name.</i>
<i>My own prisoners built me.</i>

17:10.739 --> 17:15.202
<i>Every block of my granite</i>
<i>is cemented by the blood of men.</i>

17:15.410 --> 17:17.829
<i>Is it any wonder a man</i>
<i>sometimes went berserk...</i>

17:17.954 --> 17:20.499
<i>... and fought the hated walls</i>
<i>that shut him in?</i>

17:20.707 --> 17:23.210
<i>Knock it off, you.</i>
<i>Let a guy get some sleep.</i>

17:23.335 --> 17:26.421
<i>This was a common scene</i>
<i>in those old days.</i>

17:26.630 --> 17:29.091
<i>I had so little work for them to do.</i>

17:29.800 --> 17:33.178
<i>I hear the train comin'</i>

17:34.179 --> 17:37.099
<i>Comin' down the line</i>

17:38.350 --> 17:41.228
<i>I can't see no sunshine</i>

17:42.855 --> 17:46.984
<i>From this window of mine</i>

17:50.195 --> 17:51.530
I'm stuck.

17:51.738 --> 17:57.160
<i>When I was just a baby</i>
<i>My momma said to me, "Son"</i>

17:59.371 --> 18:01.874
<i>"Always be a good boy"</i>

18:03.125 --> 18:06.128
<i>"Don't you mess around with guns"</i>

18:07.629 --> 18:11.758
<i>But I killed a man in Reno</i>

18:15.095 --> 18:19.057
<i>Just to watch him die</i>

18:22.603 --> 18:26.148
<i>When I hear that whistle blowin'</i>

18:27.691 --> 18:30.110
<i>I hang my head...</i>

18:38.911 --> 18:41.371
<i>- and cry</i>

19:12.361 --> 19:14.780
You gonna try today, John?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.407
Really try to sell something?

19:17.533 --> 19:20.911
- What does that mean?
- I cleaned out your case last night.

19:21.745 --> 19:25.541
Baby, all I found were peanut bags
and music magazines.

19:27.251 --> 19:30.003
I need you to think
about what my daddy offered.

19:33.549 --> 19:37.261
Viv, I'm trying. I mean,
I'm really trying to sell stuff.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.653
Hello, ma'am. I'm from Home Equipment
Company over on Summer...

19:54.820 --> 19:57.155
...and we have a lot of products...

19:57.364 --> 20:01.869
Enamel colors that you can choose from,
uh, that we can...

20:02.035 --> 20:06.123
Hello, I'm John Cash, and I'm from the
Home Equipment Company on Summer.

20:06.290 --> 20:09.960
Lucretia. Lucretia, who is it?

20:50.542 --> 20:52.544
Hey, you are late.

21:27.871 --> 21:31.959
<i>Well, I woke up this morning</i>
<i>Looked out the door</i>

21:32.084 --> 21:35.462
<i>I can tell that old milk cow</i>
<i>By the way she lowed</i>

21:35.671 --> 21:40.759
<i>Well, if you've seen my milk cow</i>
<i>Please ride her on home</i>

21:42.970 --> 21:48.100
<i>I ain't had no milk and butter</i>
<i>Since that cow's been gone</i>

21:50.978 --> 21:54.273
<i>I've tried to treat you right</i>
<i>Day by day</i>

21:54.439 --> 21:57.734
<i>Get out your little prayer book</i>
<i>Get down on your knees and pray</i>

21:57.943 --> 22:00.070
<i>You're gonna need</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:05.242
<i>You're gonna need your lovin'</i>
<i>Daddy's help someday</i>

22:07.119 --> 22:12.749
<i>Well, then you're gonna be sorry</i>
<i>For treating me this way</i>

22:13.542 --> 22:15.085
Oh, come now!

22:28.390 --> 22:29.975
A little higher.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.645
You're close. Little higher.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.065
A little... Yeah, a little higher.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.443
Now play the chord.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.489
That's good.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.825
Let's hear your E, Marshall.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.204
There's my E.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.040
Loulabelle, time to come in.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.336
Jack. Jack, get in here.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.463
- Let's go.
Jack.

22:59.630 --> 23:01.590
Let's go, John.

23:06.678 --> 23:09.348
<i>There are some people</i>

23:10.849 --> 23:13.393
<i>Say you cannot tell</i>

23:14.978 --> 23:21.360
<i>Whether you are saved or</i>
<i>Whether all is well</i>

23:22.819 --> 23:25.489
<i>They say you only can hope and</i>

23:26.240 --> 23:29.618
<i>Trust that it is so</i>

23:30.869 --> 23:33.705
<i>Well, I was there when it happened</i>

23:33.872 --> 23:37.501
<i>And so I guess I ought to know</i>

23:39.044 --> 23:41.672
<i>Yes, I know when Jesus saved me</i>

23:41.880 --> 23:45.551
<i>- Saved my soul</i>
<i>- The very moment He forgave me</i>

23:45.759 --> 23:47.511
<i>Made me whole</i>

23:47.719 --> 23:49.930
<i>He took away my heavy burdens</i>

23:50.138 --> 23:53.392
<i>Lord, He gave me peace within</i>

23:53.934 --> 23:58.188
<i>- Peace within</i>
<i>- Well, Satan can't make me doubt it</i>

23:58.313 --> 23:59.940
<i>I won't doubt it</i>

24:02.526 --> 24:03.861
<i>I'm gonna shout it...</i>

24:04.069 --> 24:05.153
Viv?

24:13.412 --> 24:14.955
Viv, open the door.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.040
Viv.

24:20.752 --> 24:24.381
Viv, don't embarrass me.
Everyone's out there watching.

24:30.304 --> 24:32.764
I wanna see my daddy.

24:33.473 --> 24:37.436
I wanna go home, John. Please.

24:37.603 --> 24:40.856
He's just got a job sitting in there,
in San Antonio waiting for us.

24:41.023 --> 24:43.901
- It's just sitting there, waiting.
- Viv. The guys are here.

24:44.026 --> 24:46.069
My band is here in Memphis.

24:46.612 --> 24:49.740
Your band? John, your band?

24:49.865 --> 24:54.620
Your band is two mechanics
who can't hardly play.

24:55.454 --> 24:59.333
Oh, baby, can't you hear the difference
between you and that?

24:59.499 --> 25:04.046
You have your wife and your baby
in a dump, John...

25:04.213 --> 25:09.635
...and another one on the way.
And we can't even make rent.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.345
John...

25:21.688 --> 25:27.194
<i>Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone</i>

25:28.278 --> 25:33.700
<i>You'll wake up some cold day</i>
<i>And find you're alone</i>

25:34.284 --> 25:40.791
<i>You'll call for me</i>
<i>But I'm gonna tell you, "Bye, bye, bye"</i>

25:40.916 --> 25:47.214
<i>When I turn around and walk away</i>
<i>You'll cry, cry, cry</i>

25:48.590 --> 25:52.135
<i>You're gonna cry, cry, cry</i>

25:52.302 --> 25:55.806
<i>And you'll cry alone</i>

25:55.973 --> 26:01.603
<i>When everyone's forgotten</i>
<i>And you're left on your own</i>

26:01.770 --> 26:07.693
<i>You're gonna cry, cry, cry</i>

26:09.778 --> 26:11.280
Hey.

26:11.822 --> 26:14.658
- You hate me?
- No, I don't.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.369
That's a mean song.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.080
Stupid is what it is, Viv.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.125
Yeah.

26:28.130 --> 26:31.133
Vi... Viv, it's just a song.

26:48.734 --> 26:51.403
Excuse me, sir?
You the owner of this place?

26:51.570 --> 26:54.448
- That's me.
- Hello. I'm J.R. Cash.

26:54.573 --> 26:55.949
Sam Phillips.

26:56.074 --> 26:59.119
Good to meet you, Mr. Phillips.
I'm a singer, and I got a band.

26:59.244 --> 27:00.829
We've been working on some songs.

27:00.996 --> 27:03.040
You wanna cut a record, son,
it's $4.

27:03.248 --> 27:06.460
Well, what about the guys there
on the wall in the pictures?

27:06.585 --> 27:09.671
- I mean, they pay $4?
- They're on my label.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.715
Well, how do I get on there?

27:11.882 --> 27:14.009
- You audition.
- Right now?

27:14.134 --> 27:16.011
No...

27:16.220 --> 27:18.430
Call my secretary, Marion,
when she comes back.

27:18.555 --> 27:21.475
She's at the salon. She'll get you
an appointment next month.

27:21.642 --> 27:25.020
- I can't wait that long, Mr. Phillips.
- Excuse me?

27:26.188 --> 27:27.940
I can't wait that long.

27:31.193 --> 27:34.321
- What about this one? I can iron it.
- No.

27:34.530 --> 27:37.241
John, you can't wear that one.
It's black.

27:37.449 --> 27:40.661
It's the only color of shirt we all have.
Nothing wrong with black.

27:40.786 --> 27:44.331
- It looks like you're going to a funeral.
- Well, maybe I am.

27:45.082 --> 27:48.961
<i>Yes, I know when Jesus saved me</i>
Saved my soul

27:49.169 --> 27:52.965
<i>The very moment He forgave me</i>
<i>- Made me whole</i>

27:53.131 --> 27:59.680
<i>He took away my heavy burdens</i>
<i>Lord, He gave me peace within</i>

27:59.930 --> 28:03.892
<i>- Peace within</i>
<i>- Well, Satan can't make me doubt it</i>

28:04.101 --> 28:07.521
I won't doubt it
<i>- It's real and I'm gonna shout it</i>

28:07.729 --> 28:09.439
<i>I'm gonna shout it</i>

28:09.648 --> 28:11.525
Hold on. Hold on.

28:11.692 --> 28:15.028
I hate to interrupt,
but you guys got something else?

28:19.199 --> 28:22.953
I'm sorry. I can't market gospel
no more.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.875
So that's it?

28:29.459 --> 28:32.754
I don't record material
that doesn't sell, Mr. Cash.

28:32.921 --> 28:35.591
And gospel like that doesn't sell.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.969
So is it the gospel
or the way I sing it?

28:39.303 --> 28:40.971
Both.

28:41.388 --> 28:43.974
Well, what's wrong
with the way I sing it?

28:44.141 --> 28:45.601
I don't believe you.

28:46.852 --> 28:51.106
- You saying I don't believe in God?
J.R., come on. Let's go.

28:51.315 --> 28:54.359
No. I wanna understand.
I mean, we come down here...

28:54.568 --> 28:56.945
...we play, and he tells me
I don't believe in God.

28:57.112 --> 29:01.992
You know exactly what I'm telling you.
We've already heard that song.

29:02.659 --> 29:07.915
A hundred times. Just like that.
Just like how you singing it.

29:08.790 --> 29:12.044
- Well, you didn't let us bring it home.
- Bring it...

29:12.211 --> 29:16.590
Bring it home?
All right, let's bring it home.

29:17.591 --> 29:21.136
If you was hit by a truck, and you
was lying out in that gutter dying...

29:21.303 --> 29:24.515
...and you had time to sing
one song, huh?

29:24.681 --> 29:28.352
One song people would remember
before you're dirt...

29:28.560 --> 29:32.940
...one song that would let God know
what you felt about your time...

29:33.148 --> 29:36.235
...here on Earth, one song
that would sum you up...

29:36.401 --> 29:38.904
...you telling me
that's the song you'd sing?

29:39.071 --> 29:43.659
That same Jimmie Davis tune
we hear on the radio all day?

29:44.243 --> 29:47.079
About your peace within
and how it's real...

29:47.204 --> 29:49.790
...and how you're gonna shout it?

29:49.998 --> 29:53.168
Or would you sing
something different?

29:53.293 --> 29:55.504
Something real? Something you felt?

29:55.671 --> 29:58.173
I'm telling you right now,
that's the kind of song...

29:58.340 --> 30:00.801
...people want to hear.
That's the kind of song...

30:00.926 --> 30:03.512
...that truly saves people.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.850
It ain't got nothing to do
with believing in God, Mr. Cash.

30:08.058 --> 30:10.769
It has to do with believing in yourself.

30:16.608 --> 30:19.695
Well, I got a couple songs
I wrote in the Air Force.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.658
You got anything
against the Air Force?

30:25.492 --> 30:26.952
No.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.581
I do.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.962
J.R., whatever you're about
to play, we ain't never heard it.

30:40.090 --> 30:43.385
<i>I hear the train a-comin'</i>

30:44.261 --> 30:47.639
<i>It's rollin' around the bend</i>

30:48.348 --> 30:52.019
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine</i>

30:52.352 --> 30:55.480
<i>Since I don't know when</i>

30:56.315 --> 31:00.402
<i>I'm stuck in Folsom Prison</i>

31:01.528 --> 31:06.033
<i>And time keeps draggin' on</i>

31:12.039 --> 31:16.460
<i>But that train keeps a-rollin'</i>

31:17.461 --> 31:22.090
<i>On down to San Antone</i>

31:24.134 --> 31:27.304
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

31:27.804 --> 31:31.099
<i>My momma told me, "Son"</i>

31:31.850 --> 31:37.940
<i>"Always be a good boy</i>
<i>Don't ever play with guns"</i>

31:38.065 --> 31:41.944
<i>But I shot a man in Reno</i>

31:42.819 --> 31:46.740
<i>Just to watch him die</i>

31:50.744 --> 31:54.081
<i>When I hear that whistle blowin'</i>

31:54.748 --> 31:58.544
<i>I hang my head and cry</i>

31:59.670 --> 32:04.925
<i>I bet there's rich folks eatin'</i>
<i>In a fancy dining car</i>

32:05.092 --> 32:10.013
<i>They're probably drinkin' coffee</i>
<i>And smokin' big cigars</i>

32:10.180 --> 32:13.141
<i>Well, I know I had it comin'</i>

32:13.851 --> 32:17.354
<i>I know I can't be free</i>

32:20.691 --> 32:23.735
<i>But those people keep a-movin'</i>

32:24.319 --> 32:28.031
<i>And that's what tortures me</i>

33:01.231 --> 33:03.025
Where you been?

33:04.359 --> 33:05.986
Are you drunk?

33:09.573 --> 33:13.660
- What happened?
- He didn't like our gospel.

33:15.078 --> 33:17.456
So I played him some songs
that I wrote.

33:18.790 --> 33:21.210
And we made a record, Viv.

33:21.376 --> 33:23.754
I mean a real, real record.

33:28.300 --> 33:32.596
We did it like six times. I had to sing
the song over and over again.

33:32.763 --> 33:36.266
And I'm playing it, and you should've
seen Marshall, he was so nervous.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.810
But, I mean, we made
a real record of my song.

33:38.936 --> 33:41.730
- Oh, gee.
- I can't believe it. It's still...

33:46.985 --> 33:50.155
Yes, sirree, you're listening
<i>to the Tennessee Farm Hour.</i>

33:50.322 --> 33:53.700
Now, here's a new one
from our girl Patsy.

34:05.629 --> 34:06.922
Good lyrics.

34:07.256 --> 34:08.632
Did you write it?

34:08.841 --> 34:11.260
Yeah, it won a poetry prize
<i>in Stars and Stripes.</i>

34:11.510 --> 34:14.429
That was before...
That was before I set it to music.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.356
Hey, flip that over for me, will you?

34:28.360 --> 34:32.155
This is Bob Neal, and you're listening
<i>to the Tennessee Farm Hour...</i>

34:32.364 --> 34:34.449
...brought to you
by Bronson Seed and Feed.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.621
Mr. Phillips? Oh, man, I broke it.
I broke it, I broke it.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.833
John. John. Broke what?
- The record, man, it's smashed.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.710
Mr. Neal, he asked me to flip it over...

34:44.835 --> 34:47.963
...and when I went to do it,
it slipped out of my hands and it broke.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.549
The worst part is, I think he liked it.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.885
John, I know.
We can do it right now.

34:53.051 --> 34:55.929
- Let's get Luther and Marshall.
- We don't need to record it. Sit down.

34:56.054 --> 34:57.222
- I wanna record it.
- John.

34:57.431 --> 35:01.143
Sit down, John.
You don't have to record another one.

35:01.310 --> 35:02.936
What you broke is the test press.

35:03.103 --> 35:07.482
The factory sends me one of those
before they do a run of a thousand.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.862
He's yanking your chain, Mr. Phillips.

35:12.070 --> 35:13.864
Ain't no way nobody
could be that dumb.

35:14.031 --> 35:15.490
Leave him be, Jerry Lee.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.960
John?
Hmm?

35:28.212 --> 35:30.672
When are we gonna talk about...

35:30.839 --> 35:33.592
...how this tour is gonna work?

35:34.301 --> 35:36.011
Because you're...

35:36.220 --> 35:41.350
...out of town three out of four weeks
for the next three months.

35:42.559 --> 35:44.144
Well...

35:46.271 --> 35:48.565
You wanted it.
- Viv, I don't believe it.

35:48.732 --> 35:50.275
He's playing it again.

35:50.442 --> 35:52.069
<i>Them folks at Sun tell me...</i>

35:52.194 --> 35:54.780
<i>... this boy starts a
<i>four-state tour next week.</i></i>

35:58.659 --> 36:00.744
Ho-ho! Son of a gun!

36:00.911 --> 36:03.580
We got a baby sleeping. Come on.

36:10.045 --> 36:12.005
Vivian, you hear that?

36:13.006 --> 36:15.509
Hey! Hey, that's my song!

36:15.634 --> 36:17.052
Oh, the baby.

36:29.273 --> 36:31.191
Hear Daddy in the wind?

36:34.862 --> 36:37.281
<i>Cry, cry, cry</i>

36:37.489 --> 36:39.575
I think she really likes it.

36:53.589 --> 36:56.383
<i>My name is Jerry Lee Lewis</i>
<i>Come from Louisiana</i>

36:56.550 --> 36:59.094
<i>Gonna do a little boogie</i>
<i>On this here piano!</i>

36:59.261 --> 37:01.972
<i>Doing mighty fine</i>
<i>Gonna make you shake it</i>

37:02.181 --> 37:04.850
<i>Gonna make you do it</i>
<i>Make you do it till it breaks</i>

37:05.058 --> 37:07.436
<i>Called the Lewis Boogie</i>
<i>In the Lewis way</i>

37:07.603 --> 37:11.690
<i>Lord, I do my little boogie-woogie</i>
<i>Every day</i>

37:16.320 --> 37:19.031
Never seen nobody play like that.

37:26.455 --> 37:29.249
<i>Well, down in New Orleans</i>

37:29.374 --> 37:32.044
<i>The land of dreams</i>
<i>The best doggone place, son</i>

37:32.211 --> 37:34.630
<i>You ever have seen</i>
<i>Yeah, the cats go wild</i>

37:34.796 --> 37:37.841
<i>With a boogie that's hot</i>
<i>And my boogie makes you want to stop</i>

37:38.050 --> 37:40.093
<i>And do the bop</i>
<i>It's called the Lewis Boogie</i>

37:40.302 --> 37:42.012
<i>In the Lewis way</i>

37:42.221 --> 37:47.601
<i>I do my little boogie-woogie</i>
<i>Every day!</i>

37:49.520 --> 37:54.775
Jerry Lee Lewis, ladies and
gentlemen. "The Killer," Jerry Lee Lewis.

37:56.109 --> 37:58.570
Grab yourselves a pine box, boys.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.781
Nobody follows "The Killer."

38:00.989 --> 38:05.285
These next boys have just put out
their first record called "Cry, Cry, Cry."

38:05.452 --> 38:07.829
Oh, shoot. Now I'm late.

38:07.955 --> 38:10.082
Oh, my gosh. Excuse me.

38:10.290 --> 38:14.002
That's my cue. Oh, no, y...
Oh, that's stuck right on my dress.

38:14.211 --> 38:18.382
- Hey, Bill. Hold on, Bill. I'm coming.
- I think...

38:18.590 --> 38:22.219
Oh, my, I think I hear June Carter's
voice, ladies and gentlemen.

38:24.513 --> 38:27.224
I'll be right there, Bill.
I'll be right there.

38:27.432 --> 38:29.434
Reckon when, June?

38:29.977 --> 38:32.896
Well, Bill, I got tangled.

38:33.522 --> 38:37.860
- In what, June bug?
Johnny Cash's guitar strap.

38:39.111 --> 38:42.155
Don't worry, I can keep this funny
for at least two minutes.

38:42.322 --> 38:45.701
And I'll tell you what, Bill.
He's a strapping boy, that Johnny Cash.

38:45.909 --> 38:49.121
And his guitar strap's
pretty strapping too.

38:50.330 --> 38:53.250
Here. I love that "Cry" song,
by the way.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.210
Hey, thanks.

38:55.419 --> 38:57.212
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

38:57.421 --> 39:01.592
Bill. Bill, I had to come and tell you.
I had to tell you.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.721
I had to tell you.
I just can't sing tonight.

39:07.723 --> 39:09.349
You best be getting out here.

39:09.850 --> 39:10.893
Yeah.

39:11.059 --> 39:13.854
Bill, I got the laryngitis.

39:14.354 --> 39:15.439
Me too.

39:15.564 --> 39:18.025
June, we just...
- I do. Y'all laughing, but I do.

39:19.443 --> 39:22.404
We all just heard you hollering
up a storm backstage.

39:23.530 --> 39:26.241
Well, I didn't have it then, Bill.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss June Carter.

39:39.463 --> 39:41.632
All right, June's gonna be back
to sing later.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.634
Her family's also with us tonight.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.804
But like I was saying, these boys
up next are hotter than a pistol.

39:47.971 --> 39:51.600
They are burning up the radio
with their new hit, "Cry, Cry, Cry."

39:51.725 --> 39:54.645
And I wanna make sure we give them
a big Texarkana welcome.

39:54.811 --> 39:58.232
So here they are, folks. New passengers
on the Sun Rocking Railway...

39:58.440 --> 40:00.901
...Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Two.

40:13.705 --> 40:17.251
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

40:27.511 --> 40:32.140
<i>Hey, get rhythm</i>
<i>When you get the blues</i>

40:32.266 --> 40:36.603
<i>Come on, get rhythm</i>
<i>When you get the blues</i>

40:37.229 --> 40:39.189
<i>Get a rock 'n' roll feelin'</i>
<i>In your bones</i>

40:39.356 --> 40:41.567
<i>Get taps on your toes</i>
<i>And get gone</i>

40:41.733 --> 40:45.654
<i>Get rhythm when you get the blues</i>

40:47.030 --> 40:49.700
<i>Little shoeshine boy</i>
<i>Never gets low down</i>

40:49.867 --> 40:51.577
<i>But he's got the dirtiest</i>
<i>Job in town</i>

40:51.743 --> 40:55.873
<i>Bendin' low at the people's feet</i>
<i>On the windy corner of a dirty street</i>

40:56.039 --> 40:58.041
<i>Well, I asked him</i>
<i>While he shined my shoes</i>

40:58.250 --> 41:00.210
<i>How he'd keep</i>
<i>From getting the blues</i>

41:00.419 --> 41:02.212
<i>He grinned as he raised his little head</i>

41:02.421 --> 41:04.381
<i>He popped a shoeshine rag</i>
<i>And then he said</i>

41:04.590 --> 41:08.594
<i>"Get rhythm when you get the blues</i>

41:08.760 --> 41:13.557
<i>Come on, get rhythm</i>
<i>When you get the blues</i>

41:13.724 --> 41:15.726
<i>Yes, a jumpy rhythm</i>
<i>Makes you feel so fine</i>

41:15.893 --> 41:18.520
<i>It'll shake all the trouble</i>
<i>From your worried mind</i>

41:18.645 --> 41:22.316
<i>Get rhythm when you get the blues"</i>

41:39.249 --> 41:40.751
All right.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.213
<i>Well, I sat down to listen</i>
<i>To the shoeshine boy</i>

41:44.379 --> 41:46.590
<i>And I thought I was gonna jump for joy</i>

41:46.715 --> 41:48.634
<i>Slapped on the shoe polish</i>
<i>Left and right</i>

41:48.800 --> 41:50.969
<i>He took a shoeshine rag</i>
<i>And he held it tight</i>

41:51.136 --> 41:52.930
<i>He stopped once</i>
<i>To wipe the sweat away</i>

41:53.096 --> 41:55.641
<i>I said, "You're a mighty little boy</i>
<i>To be a-workin' thataway"</i>

41:55.766 --> 41:57.351
<i>He said, "I like it"</i>
<i>With a big, wide grin</i>

41:57.559 --> 41:59.269
<i>Kept on a-poppin' and he said again</i>

41:59.436 --> 42:03.190
<i>"Get rhythm when you get the blues</i>

42:03.357 --> 42:04.566
<i>Come on and get rhythm</i>

42:04.733 --> 42:05.901
All right!

42:06.109 --> 42:08.237
<i>When you get the blues</i>

42:08.445 --> 42:10.781
<i>It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe</i>

42:10.989 --> 42:13.075
<i>It does a million dollars' worth</i>
<i>Of good for you</i>

42:13.242 --> 42:18.580
<i>Get rhythm when you get the blues"</i>

42:24.169 --> 42:27.840
Thank you. Thank you very much.

42:28.173 --> 42:29.925
<i>Well, I love that hair, long and black</i>

42:30.092 --> 42:32.010
<i>Hanging down to the middle of your back</i>

42:32.135 --> 42:35.806
<i>Don't cut it off, whatever you do</i>
<i>I need it to run my fingers through</i>

42:36.014 --> 42:39.393
Viv, I'm telling you, I think this is
the best show we've ever done.

42:39.560 --> 42:42.646
Hell, it might be the best show
I've ever seen, no kidding.

42:42.813 --> 42:46.441
<i>Where are you?</i>
- Texarkana. Baby, I miss you.

42:46.650 --> 42:50.362
Hey, do you hear Orbison doing our
song? He turned it to a two-step. Listen.

43:06.670 --> 43:07.796
- Do you hear that?
<i>- Damn it.</i>

43:07.963 --> 43:09.006
What's the matter?

43:10.424 --> 43:12.509
<i>Damn it. Roseanne just ran</i>
<i>her head into the table.</i>

43:12.676 --> 43:15.929
<i>Roseanne.</i>
<i>Roseanne. Here, talk to Daddy.</i>

43:16.096 --> 43:18.515
Hey, Roseanne? Hey, it's Daddy.

43:18.682 --> 43:22.519
Honey, don't, don't cry.
Daddy's gonna be home real soon.

43:22.686 --> 43:24.229
<i>- John, I have to go.</i>
- Huh?

43:24.479 --> 43:26.231
<i>I have to go, John.</i>

43:27.441 --> 43:28.859
Bye.

43:35.365 --> 43:38.785
Hey, y'all say hi to Johnny Cash.
Dad, he wrote that "Cry, Cry, Cry" song.

43:38.994 --> 43:40.204
Mother Maybelle.

43:40.370 --> 43:43.415
- How you doing, Johnny Cash?
- Good. Heck, I'm great, ma'am.

43:43.624 --> 43:45.709
- Hello, John, I'm Ezra.
- Yeah, I know.

43:46.585 --> 43:50.005
- It was nice to meet you, son.
- Real good to meet you, sir.

44:12.611 --> 44:16.406
<i>I walked into a honky-tonky</i>
<i>Just the other day</i>

44:16.573 --> 44:20.285
<i>I dropped a nickel in a jukebox</i>
<i>Just to hear it play</i>

44:20.494 --> 44:24.331
<i>I didn't have no tune in mind</i>
<i>I didn't wait to choose</i>

44:24.831 --> 44:28.961
<i>Just dropped a nickel in the slot</i>
<i>And played the Jukebox Blues</i>

44:36.552 --> 44:38.512
<i>There's a guy in there</i>
<i>With an old tin horn</i>

44:38.720 --> 44:40.514
<i>And a feller on an old banjo</i>

44:40.681 --> 44:42.766
<i>And the man on the fiddle</i>
<i>He wasn't no slouch</i>

44:42.933 --> 44:45.102
<i>He could really drag that bow</i>

44:48.230 --> 44:51.233
You sounded good tonight, Cash.
Real tight.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.652
Oh, thanks, man.

44:54.570 --> 44:56.321
You want some chili fries?

44:56.530 --> 44:58.740
Oh, no, that's okay.

44:58.949 --> 45:02.911
She's been in the spotlight since
you and me was biting ankles.

45:03.287 --> 45:05.372
They say Maybelle
had a crib at the Ryman...

45:05.581 --> 45:08.375
...so she could pull her out
and let her whoop and holler...

45:08.542 --> 45:10.711
...and pop her back in
and go to sleep.

45:10.836 --> 45:12.379
<i>It must have been a drum</i>

45:12.796 --> 45:16.884
<i>It gave that song a solid beat</i>
<i>Boy, he was goin' some</i>

45:24.516 --> 45:28.395
<i>I walked into a honky-tonky</i>
<i>Just the other day</i>

45:28.604 --> 45:32.232
<i>I dropped a nickel in a jukebox</i>
<i>Just to hear it play</i>

45:32.649 --> 45:36.570
<i>I didn't have no tune in mind</i>
<i>I didn't wait to choose</i>

45:36.737 --> 45:40.574
<i>Just dropped a nickel in the slot</i>
<i>And played the Jukebox Blues</i>

45:48.665 --> 45:52.461
<i>I've played a lot of jukeboxes</i>
<i>Most every one in town</i>

45:52.669 --> 45:56.965
<i>But that's the first tune I ever heard</i>
<i>That could make one dance around</i>

45:58.926 --> 46:00.761
<i>Play the Jukebox Blues</i>

46:00.969 --> 46:04.890
<i>Such a rhythm I never heard</i>
<i>I danced out both of my shoes</i>

46:16.151 --> 46:19.196
- We're leaving in an hour, John.
All right.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.284
Oh, that's a sweet story, honey.

46:25.035 --> 46:26.745
All right.

46:26.954 --> 46:28.497
No.

46:29.665 --> 46:31.333
I'm leaving in, like, five minutes.

46:32.292 --> 46:33.710
All right.

46:33.836 --> 46:36.129
Is everything else all right?

46:37.631 --> 46:39.174
I love you too.

46:40.926 --> 46:43.595
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
How you doing?

46:43.762 --> 46:45.556
- Coffee?
- Yeah...

46:45.764 --> 46:47.599
...and some toast, please.

46:51.645 --> 46:53.313
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

46:53.480 --> 46:54.815
Good. Do you mind?

46:54.982 --> 46:56.483
No, not at all.

46:56.650 --> 46:59.111
- Did you lose your voice?
- I did.

46:59.236 --> 47:01.154
I was just singing my heart out
up there.

47:01.572 --> 47:05.242
I got to ask you how you came up
with that sound.

47:05.492 --> 47:06.535
What sound?

47:06.702 --> 47:10.706
That sound everybody's talking about.
Steady like a train. Sharp like a razor.

47:11.957 --> 47:15.210
Well, we'd play faster if we could.

47:15.377 --> 47:18.797
You know, I guess
it just come out like that.

47:19.590 --> 47:22.384
I gotta close my register.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

47:24.595 --> 47:26.430
Thank you.

47:28.223 --> 47:30.934
Here's a picture of my wife, Viv.

47:31.143 --> 47:34.605
- My baby, Roseanne.
- Oh, look at her. She's beautiful.

47:35.355 --> 47:37.065
Thanks. Got another one on the way.

47:37.232 --> 47:38.734
- I got a little girl too.
- Yeah?

47:38.901 --> 47:41.820
Her name's Carlene. Yeah.
She's about the same age.

47:45.782 --> 47:48.911
When I was in the service,
I used to look at pictures of you.

47:49.036 --> 47:51.205
- You know, in magazines.
- Oh.

47:53.457 --> 47:55.959
No. No, it wasn't like that.

47:56.126 --> 47:58.420
I mean, I...
I liked your music, you know?

47:58.587 --> 48:00.214
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:00.380 --> 48:04.384
I mean, I... You were... Well, you are...
I mean, I... I kept track of you.

48:04.593 --> 48:06.887
Yeah, you and your family, you know.

48:07.054 --> 48:09.640
I listened to your voice my whole life,
you know?

48:10.933 --> 48:14.937
Now, me and my brother, Jack,
we always listened to your songs.

48:15.103 --> 48:17.105
- You know, like "Swallerin' Place."
- Yeah.

48:17.272 --> 48:20.526
Yeah, we liked it
when you'd sing one alone.

48:20.692 --> 48:23.612
Well, you and Jack are the only ones.

48:24.530 --> 48:28.283
- What do you mean?
- I'm not really much of a singer, John.

48:28.450 --> 48:32.287
I mean, I got a lot of personality,
I got sass.

48:32.454 --> 48:36.500
I give it my all, but my sister Anita's
really the one who's got the pipes.

48:36.792 --> 48:38.544
- Well, who said that?
- Everybody.

48:38.710 --> 48:40.420
My mama, my daddy.

48:40.587 --> 48:44.800
That's how come I learned to be funny.
So I'd have something to offer.

48:47.010 --> 48:48.971
Well...

48:49.263 --> 48:51.640
Parents aren't always
the best judge of things...

48:51.765 --> 48:53.517
...you want my opinion.

48:57.563 --> 48:59.982
So how long you on the tour?

49:00.190 --> 49:03.151
Another couple of weeks.
We just got on board...

49:03.360 --> 49:06.697
...but I tell you,
it feels like a lot longer.

49:06.864 --> 49:08.365
I'm sure.

49:08.574 --> 49:10.492
I'm headed off.
I'm going to the Ryman.

49:10.701 --> 49:13.495
Tell your brother Jack to tune in,
I'll sing him something.

49:13.662 --> 49:14.997
What does he like?

49:15.163 --> 49:19.459
Oh, that's... That's sweet.
But he passed.

49:19.626 --> 49:22.754
I'm sorry. Were y'all real close?

49:23.380 --> 49:27.676
Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh...

49:31.346 --> 49:36.185
It's funny, I ain't talked about Jack
in a long time, you know? It's...

49:37.686 --> 49:42.191
After he died, I...
I talked about him all the time...

49:44.193 --> 49:47.196
...but I guess people grew tired of it.

49:47.821 --> 49:49.781
So I just stopped.

49:56.246 --> 49:57.664
John?

50:01.835 --> 50:03.795
You're tired, aren't you?

50:06.173 --> 50:08.050
Yeah.

50:08.717 --> 50:10.969
It'll slow down.

50:12.930 --> 50:14.640
It will.

50:15.557 --> 50:18.060
I better get going.

50:18.810 --> 50:20.145
It was good to talk to you.

50:20.312 --> 50:21.855
- You too.
- Take care.

50:22.022 --> 50:25.150
Hopefully, I'll see you soon.
- You better tune in.

50:25.317 --> 50:28.820
- I'll sing you that "Swallerin' Place."
- I will. I really will.

50:28.946 --> 50:30.697
Okay.

50:43.293 --> 50:45.170
That's fine. That's... That's perfect.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.964
Yes, ma'am.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.594
When was the last time you heard him
moving around in there?

50:52.761 --> 50:54.763
I don't know.

51:03.981 --> 51:07.067
Thought you were gonna
help me today, John.

51:13.740 --> 51:16.034
You head out tomorrow.

51:16.243 --> 51:18.704
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:19.246 --> 51:23.333
Better start living life here with us
when you come home...

51:23.500 --> 51:25.627
...before you have to leave again.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.883
You know, I was thinking.

51:31.049 --> 51:33.760
You know, maybe I could get Bob
to push my dates.

51:34.344 --> 51:36.722
I'm happy when I'm here.

51:38.307 --> 51:41.226
I like waking up and seeing your face.

51:52.196 --> 51:53.780
John, those bags over there...

51:55.032 --> 51:59.036
Those letters in there
are 10-to-one from girls.

51:59.286 --> 52:03.332
Ten to one. And they're obscene.

52:03.540 --> 52:05.501
Reba's been trying to answer
some of them.

52:05.667 --> 52:07.211
Half of them ain't even 15...

52:07.377 --> 52:10.881
...and they are sending pictures
of themselves in bathing suits.

52:11.089 --> 52:14.635
Pictures for you to look at
while you're doing time at Folsom.

52:16.970 --> 52:19.389
- Oh, Viv.
- This one girl, she sent you her diar...

52:19.515 --> 52:22.226
Viv, don't even read
those letters, they're...

52:22.392 --> 52:24.937
It's just crazy right now, that's all.

52:25.145 --> 52:26.855
You know.

52:27.481 --> 52:29.900
Hell, you should have seen last week.

52:30.067 --> 52:32.569
We was at the fair...

52:32.736 --> 52:35.364
...and this bus full of 4-H girls
pulls up, you know...

52:35.531 --> 52:37.533
...and they come piling out of there.

52:37.699 --> 52:40.702
They go running, screaming
after Carl and Roy. I mean, running.

52:40.911 --> 52:44.081
John. I have a casserole in the oven
and your sister...

52:44.289 --> 52:47.751
...in the kitchen, and I don't want
to talk about the tour.

52:49.127 --> 52:52.130
Well, Viv, you, you're the one
that brought it up.

52:52.965 --> 52:55.300
In fact, that's my new rule.

52:55.467 --> 52:56.802
When you come home...

52:57.010 --> 53:00.013
...I wanna get right down
to talking about regular things.

53:00.180 --> 53:02.224
Viv, don't give me no rules.

53:02.432 --> 53:04.268
All I got are rules.

53:04.434 --> 53:06.645
All I got is to be
at this place at this time.

53:06.812 --> 53:07.980
I'm trying to go there...

53:08.146 --> 53:10.691
...and I'm trying to spend time
with you, the kids.

53:10.816 --> 53:13.443
And write songs through this.
What do you want from me?

53:13.610 --> 53:17.322
I got you your dream house. All of your
things, all the pretty little things.

53:17.489 --> 53:20.325
I got you your car.
What do you want from me?

53:20.534 --> 53:26.456
I want you, John. I want you. And I
want everything that you promised me.

53:27.499 --> 53:29.751
Well, what if I can't do that?

53:57.821 --> 53:59.531
Got your mind on something?

54:01.617 --> 54:03.410
What are you doing up there, man?

54:03.660 --> 54:06.079
I'm building a bomb.

54:06.205 --> 54:08.665
Where are we going again?

54:08.832 --> 54:11.877
Tyler. George Jones' show.

54:12.211 --> 54:14.880
Where was it we just was?

54:15.130 --> 54:17.799
- Have another one, Carl.
Austin, Carl.

54:18.050 --> 54:19.635
That's where y'all picked me up.

54:19.801 --> 54:22.054
Hey, John,
you seen the new charts?

54:22.221 --> 54:24.056
"Cry, Cry, Cry" was 14, I think.

54:24.223 --> 54:26.350
Yeah, I heard that,
but I haven't seen it.

54:26.600 --> 54:30.103
Wherever we've been, I can tell you
where we're going.

54:31.480 --> 54:34.566
Everybody in this car's going to hell.

54:34.733 --> 54:37.236
And what about the car up there?

54:37.402 --> 54:40.280
We're all going to hell
for the songs we sing.

54:40.447 --> 54:42.491
People who listen to them
will go to hell too.

54:42.616 --> 54:44.743
You shut up with that.

54:44.952 --> 54:46.787
God gave us a great big apple, see?

54:46.954 --> 54:48.455
And he said, "Don't touch it."

54:48.664 --> 54:52.334
He didn't say touch it once in a while
or take a nibble when you're hungry.

54:52.543 --> 54:54.461
He said, "Don't touch it."

54:54.962 --> 54:56.755
Don't think about touching it.

54:56.964 --> 54:58.423
Don't sing about touching it.

54:58.590 --> 55:01.510
Don't think about
singing about touching it.

55:04.805 --> 55:08.642
And what about me, Jerry Lee?
Am I going to hell?

55:09.810 --> 55:12.437
No, June. You're beautiful.

55:13.146 --> 55:16.149
Sleepy is what I am.

55:18.735 --> 55:21.113
She's making me fall in love with her.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.578
Feel my heart. Come here. Sincerely.

55:27.786 --> 55:30.330
Feel my heart, baby.
It's just a-beating for you.

55:30.497 --> 55:31.957
- Stop.
Come on, feel it.

55:32.124 --> 55:33.500
- I'm falling for you.
Hey.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.878
- No, you're not. Jerry Lee.
Jerry Lee.

55:36.044 --> 55:37.087
Come on.

55:37.254 --> 55:39.965
Sit your ass down. Just sit down.

55:40.424 --> 55:43.010
The 1957 Chevrolet.
<i>There's new designs...</i>

55:44.344 --> 55:46.096
Looks like we're here.

55:46.555 --> 55:48.015
Oh, thank goodness.

55:48.891 --> 55:50.851
Get me out of this car
and all these boys.

56:03.572 --> 56:05.532
Let's go. Home sweet home, boys.

56:07.075 --> 56:09.620
You can just put those
right there. That'd be great.

56:12.539 --> 56:14.875
Oh, wait. I wanted
to give you that Billboard.

56:15.918 --> 56:17.836
Oh, right.

56:18.962 --> 56:21.340
It's in here somewhere.

56:22.883 --> 56:25.093
You got a library in there, June.

56:27.012 --> 56:31.391
Here it is. I circled it for you.
It's right there.

56:31.725 --> 56:33.352
Yeah, 14.

56:35.145 --> 56:37.147
I can't believe it.

56:38.982 --> 56:41.860
Um, I wanted to give you this.

56:43.403 --> 56:46.740
I just finished it. It's really amazing.

56:47.115 --> 56:49.701
<i>- "The Prophet"?</i>
- Yeah.

56:49.910 --> 56:51.411
Keep it.

56:51.620 --> 56:53.664
- Oh, no. You don't...
- Whenever I finish a book...

56:53.872 --> 56:56.750
...I give it away to somebody.
It just lightens my load.

56:59.044 --> 57:00.420
John.

57:04.925 --> 57:07.886
I just went through a terrible divorce.

57:10.264 --> 57:13.392
And I got a world of judgment
on me right now.

57:17.271 --> 57:20.357
And, um, it's really
none of my business...

57:20.524 --> 57:23.527
...but you seem like you have
a nice family.

57:26.071 --> 57:28.657
I'm sorry. It just happened.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.493
Just happened?

57:31.702 --> 57:33.745
Yeah.

57:34.413 --> 57:38.417
And you wear black because you can't
find anything else to wear?

57:38.584 --> 57:41.920
You found your sound
because you can't play no better?

57:42.462 --> 57:45.340
And you just tried
to kiss me...

57:45.507 --> 57:47.092
...because it just happened?

57:50.929 --> 57:54.933
You should try taking credit
for something every once in a while.

57:56.977 --> 57:58.937
John.

58:09.072 --> 58:11.200
- Hey, Luth.
- Hey, John.

58:11.617 --> 58:13.285
You okay?

58:13.452 --> 58:15.954
I'll let you know in a few minutes.
How you doing?

58:16.121 --> 58:19.833
Okay. That boy Elvis
sure likes to talk poon.

58:21.126 --> 58:22.711
That's all I heard since Lubbock.

58:24.713 --> 58:27.090
- You want some?
- What is it?

58:29.134 --> 58:32.095
They'll make you wanna drive
all the way to Jacksonville...

58:32.262 --> 58:34.723
...and enjoy yourself
once you get there.

58:35.182 --> 58:37.351
Elvis takes them.

58:38.894 --> 58:40.771
Yeah.

58:44.483 --> 58:45.984
Yes, sir.
Try some.

58:46.151 --> 58:48.111
That's a lot. Be careful.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.030
Here comes Marshall with his bomb.

58:50.155 --> 58:53.617
You got your lighter, J. R?
- Yeah.

58:54.326 --> 58:57.412
All right, you help me
get up in there. Grab that fuse.

58:57.579 --> 58:59.540
How long we got us after we light it?

58:59.790 --> 59:01.750
About 30 seconds a foot.

59:02.584 --> 59:03.877
All right.

59:05.170 --> 59:07.214
He light it?
Does your wife know...

59:07.381 --> 59:08.590
...you like to blow stuff up?

59:08.757 --> 59:12.427
Sure she does. That's why
I married her, John.

59:12.594 --> 59:13.971
Well, you light it?

59:14.179 --> 59:16.431
There's a bomb up there...

59:18.600 --> 59:20.060
It'll go.

59:22.896 --> 59:23.981
It didn't work.

59:24.189 --> 59:25.983
Way to go, Johnny boy.

59:31.280 --> 59:34.366
<i>It was around about four</i>
<i>And I thought she would stop</i>

59:34.533 --> 59:36.910
<i>She looked at me</i>
<i>And then she looked at the clock</i>

59:37.077 --> 59:39.997
<i>She said, "Now, wait a minute, Daddy</i>
<i>Now, don't you get sore"</i>

59:40.163 --> 59:43.125
<i>"'Cause all I want to do</i>
<i>Is rock a little bit more"</i>

59:43.292 --> 59:48.213
<i>'Cause she's my rock 'n' roll Ruby</i>
<i>Rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll Ruby</i>

59:48.380 --> 59:51.049
<i>Rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>When Ruby starts a-rockin'</i>

59:51.258 --> 59:53.886
<i>It satisfies my soul</i>

59:55.721 --> 01:00:01.435
<i>One night my Ruby left me all alone</i>
<i>I tried to contact her on the telephone</i>

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:03.937
<i>I finally found her about twelve o'clock</i>

01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:07.357
<i>She said, "Leave me 'lone, Daddy</i>
<i>'Cause your Ruby wants to rock"</i>

01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:09.193
<i>'Cause she's my rock 'n' roll Ruby</i>

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:13.572
<i>Rock 'n' roll</i>
<i>Rock 'n' roll Ruby, rock 'n' roll</i>

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.326
<i>When Ruby starts a-rockin'</i>
<i>Man, it satisfies my soul</i>

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.836
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:00:31.298 --> 01:00:33.342
How about them boys, huh?

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.470
Johnny Cash
and the Tennessee Three.

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:38.931
- You kicked it good tonight, John.
Thanks, man.

01:00:39.097 --> 01:00:40.766
That's right. Kiss his ass.

01:00:40.933 --> 01:00:42.601
Hey, Jerry Lee,
your mama know you're out?

01:00:42.768 --> 01:00:44.478
She knows.

01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:46.188
She knows.

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.607
How about that Johnny Cash,
everybody?

01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:51.193
Johnny Cash.

01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:03.830
<i>Well, that's all right, Mama</i>
<i>That's all right with you</i>

01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:05.874
<i>That's all right, Mama</i>

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:07.626
<i>Just any way you do</i>

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:10.838
<i>Well, that's all right, that's all right</i>

01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:14.299
<i>That's all right now, Mama</i>

01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:16.802
<i>Any way you do</i>

01:01:17.678 --> 01:01:19.638
<i>Well, Mama, she done told me</i>

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:21.139
<i>Papa done told me, too</i>

01:01:21.306 --> 01:01:23.642
<i>Said, "Son, that gal you're foolin' with</i>

01:01:23.851 --> 01:01:25.310
<i>She ain't no good for you"</i>

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:28.480
<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:31.650
<i>Now, that's all right now, Mama</i>

01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:34.278
<i>Any way you do</i>

01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:35.821
Okay.

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:54.798
Mr. Cash?
Yeah?

01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.176
There's a Miss Audrey Parks
here to see you.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.595
Who?

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.431
Audrey Parks.

01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:11.273
Hey.

01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:22.242
<i>Well, that's all right</i>
<i>That's all right</i>

01:02:22.451 --> 01:02:28.207
<i>Now, that's all right now, Mama</i>
<i>Any way you do</i>

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.501
<i>Oh, get it now!</i>

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:39.426
Ray, why don't you say grace?

01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:43.430
Mama, it's J.R.'s table.
Why don't you say grace, J. R?

01:02:43.764 --> 01:02:45.682
No, go ahead, Pa.

01:03:10.082 --> 01:03:14.336
<i>I go out on a party</i>

01:03:15.504 --> 01:03:17.506
<i>And look...</i>

01:03:17.965 --> 01:03:23.011
<i>I go out on a party</i>

01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:27.599
<i>And look for a little fun</i>

01:03:29.518 --> 01:03:31.478
<i>I found...</i>

01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:35.816
<i>But I find a...</i>

01:03:35.983 --> 01:03:38.026
Shit.

01:03:43.115 --> 01:03:48.704
<i>But I find a darkened corner</i>

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:48.555
<i>Go out on a party</i>

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:56.104
<i>And look for a little fun</i>

01:04:58.065 --> 01:05:03.862
<i>But I find a darkened corner</i>

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:23.465
<i>'Cause I still miss someone</i>

01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:35.727
<i>'Cause I still miss someone</i>

01:05:40.566 --> 01:05:43.277
Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:55.706
You're June Carter, ain't you?
Oh, my. Betsy Purvis.

01:05:55.914 --> 01:05:57.374
Hi, Betsy.
So nice to meet you.

01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:59.168
- We're coming to the show.
- Wonderful.

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:02.963
- This is my husband, Lloyd.
Hi, Lloyd. So nice to meet you.

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.882
You know where
the fishing tackle is?

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:08.427
- Back of them footballs on the corner.
- All right, great.

01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:11.847
Enjoy the show. And if you have
any requests, just holler them out.

01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:13.348
Good morning.
- Hey.

01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:15.225
She's even prettier in person.

01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:38.832
Can I help you?
- Oh, I'm looking for some lace.

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:42.252
Oh, the sewing store on Saticoy's
got lace.

01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:44.588
Thank you.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.341
You know, your ma and pa...

01:06:47.508 --> 01:06:49.760
...are good Christians
in a world gone to pot.

01:06:49.927 --> 01:06:51.637
Well, I'll tell them you said that.

01:06:51.803 --> 01:06:53.805
I'm surprised they still speak to you.

01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:56.725
After that stunt with Carl Smith.

01:06:56.934 --> 01:07:00.854
Divorce is an abomination.
Marriage is for life.

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:05.651
I'm sorry I let you down, ma'am.

01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:24.628
- Hey.
Hey.

01:07:24.795 --> 01:07:26.129
What's funny?

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:29.091
You've been standing in that
spot for about 10 minutes...

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:31.134
...staring at that Polly Pepper book.

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:36.431
Well, I can't... I can't figure which
one Roseanne would like more.

01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:38.976
She got brown hair,
which makes me think this one.

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:41.562
- Right.
- But this is "Baby Sisters."

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.897
And she got a baby sister, and...

01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:46.692
Well, I got that one for Carlene,
and she liked it.

01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:51.071
- Mm-hm. I missed her birthday.
- Oh.

01:07:51.238 --> 01:07:53.115
So I wanted
to get her something more...

01:07:53.323 --> 01:07:56.034
...you know? Like one
of these dollhouses.

01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:58.453
But I don't know how
to get it out to her.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.581
Want me to help you?

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:07.421
I think there's a lake right
up around the corner.

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:18.807
- You got a hitch in your giddyup?
- Yeah.

01:08:39.077 --> 01:08:41.747
Forgot how much I like this.

01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:47.085
Hey, June? I never used one of these
fancy reels before.

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:49.546
Well, what'd you use, a sapling?

01:08:49.712 --> 01:08:51.340
Yeah.

01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:53.800
Okay, hold on. I'll help you.

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:56.886
It's like there's some kind
of lock on it or...

01:08:57.095 --> 01:08:59.598
No. My daddy taught me
how to do this, I'll show you.

01:08:59.765 --> 01:09:01.433
Keep your thumb there
on the button.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.935
That loosens the line.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.937
And then you're gonna bring it back.

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:06.897
Then you're gonna throw it out there.

01:09:07.064 --> 01:09:09.942
And then when you're ready,
if you got a good spot for it...

01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:12.109
...you let go of the button. All right?

01:09:12.277 --> 01:09:14.196
- Sidearm?
- Yeah, sidearm.

01:09:14.363 --> 01:09:15.697
All right.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:19.952
See? There you go.

01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:43.767
<i>Just around the corner</i>
<i>There's heartache</i>

01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:49.773
<i>Down the street that losers use</i>

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:54.945
<i>If you can wade in</i>
<i>Through the teardrops</i>

01:09:55.737 --> 01:10:00.242
<i>You'll find me</i>
<i>At the Home of the Blues</i>

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:05.873
<i>Yeah, you're gonna find me at</i>
<i>The Home of the Blues</i>

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:18.260
Hey, folks, what do you say
we get June Carter out here again?

01:10:18.427 --> 01:10:20.137
Maybe she'll sing with me.

01:10:20.304 --> 01:10:21.638
No, no, no. No.

01:10:21.847 --> 01:10:23.891
Oh, come on, June.
I never sing with you.

01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:26.560
I got my slippers on,
and I'm not coming out there.

01:10:26.768 --> 01:10:28.854
They don't care
if you got your slippers on.

01:10:29.021 --> 01:10:30.898
Come on,
it's the shank of the evening.

01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:33.317
Folks, let's hear it. June. June.

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:34.943
<i>June, June, June.</i>

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.654
<i>June, June, June.</i>

01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:41.241
<i>- June, June, June.</i>
- Come on, June, prove Elvis wrong.

01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:44.661
He says you can't do nothing
that ain't written in your calendar.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:47.956
<i>June, June, June,</i>
<i>June, June, June.</i>

01:10:59.468 --> 01:11:01.386
See, June?
They wanna see us together.

01:11:01.553 --> 01:11:04.473
All right. Quit that clutching on me
and I'll sing with you.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.642
But you gotta quit clutching on me.

01:11:06.808 --> 01:11:08.727
Hi, folks. How y'all doing again?

01:11:08.894 --> 01:11:11.480
I hope y'all don't mind my bare feet.

01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:13.315
So, what are we gonna sing, Johnny?

01:11:13.482 --> 01:11:15.901
You got me out here.
Is that where your plan ends?

01:11:17.361 --> 01:11:19.446
Well, I always liked
that song of yours:

01:11:19.613 --> 01:11:21.657
"Time's a-Wastin'."
Let's do that one.

01:11:21.823 --> 01:11:25.786
Oh, come on. I don't know about that.
How about your hit song, "Big River"?

01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:27.663
That's a good song.

01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:29.831
Well, "Big River" ain't a duet.

01:11:29.998 --> 01:11:33.168
- Uh, let's do "Time's a-Wastin'."
- I am not gonna sing that song.

01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:37.005
It's inappropriate. I recorded it
with my ex-husband. I will not sing it.

01:11:37.214 --> 01:11:38.924
No better way to put it behind you.

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:41.844
- I'm not gonna do it.
- June, just sing.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:44.471
<i>- I've got arms</i>
<i>- And I've got arms</i>

01:11:44.638 --> 01:11:47.182
<i>Let's get together and use those arms</i>

01:11:47.391 --> 01:11:49.434
<i>Let's go</i>

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:52.062
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.314
<i>I've got lips</i>

01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:55.816
<i>And I've got lips</i>

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:58.110
<i>Let's get together and use those lips</i>

01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:00.571
<i>Let's go</i>

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:03.490
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>

01:12:03.657 --> 01:12:06.368
<i>A cake's no good</i>
<i>If you don't mix the batter</i>

01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:08.704
<i>And bake it</i>

01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:10.747
<i>And love's just a bubble</i>

01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:13.667
<i>If you don't take the trouble</i>
<i>To make it</i>

01:12:14.376 --> 01:12:17.546
<i>- So if you're free to go with me</i>
<i>- So if you're free to go with me</i>

01:12:17.713 --> 01:12:20.048
<i>I'll take it quicker than one-two-three</i>

01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:22.342
<i>Let's go</i>

01:12:22.509 --> 01:12:25.137
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>
<i>- Time's a-wastin'</i>

01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:40.194
Don't do that.

01:12:40.986 --> 01:12:43.071
Hey, June.

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.211
June? Open up.

01:12:57.377 --> 01:12:58.754
June, open the door.

01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:01.924
Just leave me be, John, all right?

01:13:02.799 --> 01:13:06.261
What? What, what did I do?

01:13:06.929 --> 01:13:08.305
June, it's a song.

01:13:09.806 --> 01:13:12.768
Just please get away from me.

01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:19.835
<i>I think I hear Johnny</i>
<i>Cash and the Tennessee Three.</i>

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:22.337
<i>They'll be playing all weekend long</i>
<i>at the Malco.</i>

01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:23.881
<i>Matinees and evening shows...</i>

01:14:24.047 --> 01:14:27.718
<i>... along with Jerry Lee Lewis,</i>
<i>June Carter and Carl Perkins.</i>

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:08.550
<i>It's the candyman</i>

01:15:08.717 --> 01:15:11.345
<i>Well, all you ladies gather round</i>

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.180
<i>You know who's comin' to town</i>

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:14.723
<i>And it ain't Santa Claus</i>

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:16.225
<i>It's the candyman</i>

01:15:16.391 --> 01:15:18.143
The candyman right there, Luther.

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:21.563
How come you don't never try
this brand of picking, Luther?

01:15:25.859 --> 01:15:28.362
What you're looking for, Waylon,
I already found.

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:32.032
<i>The candyman is coming home</i>

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:35.744
<i>Don't get stuck</i>
<i>On the candyman's stick</i>

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:39.873
Well, hey, June.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.125
Hey, Jerry Lee.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.798
How you doing, John?

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:52.845
Uh...

01:15:53.637 --> 01:15:56.014
Well, okay, June. How you doing?

01:15:56.974 --> 01:15:58.976
I surmise you've never been to bed.

01:15:59.184 --> 01:16:01.979
- "Surmise."
We got a show at 2.

01:16:02.187 --> 01:16:04.606
- A matinee. You remember?
We were just practicing.

01:16:04.773 --> 01:16:07.276
- Sit down. It's slick here.
Practice makes perfect.

01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:10.112
- Not today, Jerry Lee.
Why not?

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:12.364
- Because you're drunk.
Uh-oh.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.243
Amen, brother.

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:19.121
Come on, Junie, just come
have a beer with us.

01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:21.665
I'm going home tonight
after the show.

01:16:21.832 --> 01:16:24.084
I'm not here to look after y'all.

01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:27.671
You're not?

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.303
You got somebody
to do that for you, John.

01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:37.222
You got a wife somewhere.
You remember that?

01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:38.432
Well, what if I didn't?

01:16:40.642 --> 01:16:42.561
There's too many ifs in that sentence.

01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:44.062
Only one, actually.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:47.441
There's only one if
in that sentence, June.

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:49.776
Good point.

01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:53.238
I thought it was a good point.
I mean, there is only one.

01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.032
- Really?
It's a good point.

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:01.997
Hey.
- Don't talk to me like that.

01:17:02.206 --> 01:17:04.625
We surrender. We surrender.

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:07.377
What was I thinking?
I must've been crazy.

01:17:08.045 --> 01:17:09.713
Y'all are gonna blow this tour.

01:17:10.088 --> 01:17:12.382
You can't walk no line.

01:17:13.509 --> 01:17:15.177
June, we ain't blowing the tour.

01:17:15.344 --> 01:17:19.264
I am not gonna be that little Dutch boy
with my finger in the dam no more.

01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:22.351
You're lying to yourself
if you think this is about a tour.

01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:24.269
This isn't about a tour.

01:17:24.478 --> 01:17:26.313
This isn't about a song.

01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:46.917
<i>I keep a close watch</i>
<i>On this heart of mine</i>

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:51.463
<i>I keep my eyes wide open all the time</i>

01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:55.717
<i>I keep the ends out</i>
<i>For the tie that binds</i>

01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:57.219
I got his picture.

01:17:57.386 --> 01:18:00.889
<i>Because you're mine, I walk the line</i>

01:18:04.643 --> 01:18:08.814
<i>As sure as night is dark</i>
<i>And day is light</i>

01:18:09.273 --> 01:18:13.151
<i>I keep you on my mind</i>
<i>Both day and night</i>

01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:17.656
<i>And happiness I've known</i>
<i>Proves that it's right</i>

01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:21.493
John. Honey, I wanna take
your picture. Roseanne, look at Mommy.

01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:23.120
Say cheese.

01:18:25.539 --> 01:18:29.835
<i>You've got a way</i>
<i>To keep me on your side</i>

01:18:30.294 --> 01:18:34.339
<i>You give me cause for love</i>
<i>That I can't hide</i>

01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:39.178
<i>For you I know</i>
<i>I'd even try to turn the tide</i>

01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:43.682
<i>Because you're mine, I walk the line</i>

01:18:44.266 --> 01:18:46.185
What do you think of California?

01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:48.353
We like it.
We just bought a house.

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:52.816
<i>I keep a close watch</i>
<i>On this heart of mine</i>

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.404
<i>I keep my eyes wide open all the time</i>

01:18:58.155 --> 01:19:02.409
<i>I keep the ends out</i>
<i>For the tie that binds</i>

01:19:02.868 --> 01:19:06.914
<i>Because you're mine, I walk the line</i>

01:19:25.307 --> 01:19:26.892
Lunchtime.

01:19:27.684 --> 01:19:29.811
Come on in, everybody.

01:19:32.272 --> 01:19:35.526
Hey, Kath? Roseanne?

01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:38.278
Hey, girls, look up in the sky.

01:19:38.779 --> 01:19:42.533
Hey, girls!
Hurry up, you can't miss it.

01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:44.743
Hey. You see that bird up there?

01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:50.374
You see that bird? That's a falcon.

01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:51.667
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:54.127
Lunchtime.

01:19:54.294 --> 01:19:55.671
Come on in, everybody.

01:19:55.838 --> 01:19:58.215
This is the topic.
<i>All right, the answer is:</i>

01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:00.509
You ought to know that one.
You look at the funnies.

01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:02.928
- Shmoos.
<i>What were the shmoos?</i>

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:05.389
<i>Correct. Go on and choose the next.</i>

01:20:05.556 --> 01:20:07.349
<i>Let's go with...</i>

01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:09.476
What is this?

01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:11.228
Hey, I've been looking for that.

01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:13.897
That's the letter I wrote
to Bob Dylan on the plane.

01:20:14.064 --> 01:20:15.774
That folk singer I told you about.

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:18.652
You wrote it on an
airsickness bag, honey.

01:20:19.736 --> 01:20:20.821
So what?

01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:24.116
What's so funny?

01:20:24.366 --> 01:20:27.828
I was thinking maybe
you ought to try sleeping at night.

01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:31.123
Maybe eating. Maybe both.

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:36.503
Hey, Viv, you made
your mind up about tonight?

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:39.715
You coming?

01:20:41.717 --> 01:20:44.303
Well, okay. Because you're asking
so nice.

01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:48.640
I got it. Got it.

01:20:52.269 --> 01:20:54.354
Hello? Hey, Bob.

01:20:54.521 --> 01:20:58.066
Hey, can you hold on a second?
One second.

01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:11.580
Hello.

01:21:11.955 --> 01:21:16.585
So, uh, you tell them awards people
that we're gonna come.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:18.587
Uh-huh.

01:21:19.546 --> 01:21:23.550
Hey, Bob. Do you know,
is June gonna be there?

01:21:24.259 --> 01:21:28.180
This year we had a British
invasion, a beautiful girl from Brazil...

01:21:28.347 --> 01:21:31.892
...a matchmaker from New York.
We even had a flying nanny.

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:34.895
- In 1964, we covered the globe.
Hey, Johnny.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:36.396
Hey, Randy, how are you?

01:21:36.563 --> 01:21:38.065
- With some incredible acts...

01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:39.608
June? Hey.

01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:41.109
Hi, John.

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:44.071
- Been a long time.
- Yeah.

01:21:44.238 --> 01:21:46.657
- Hi, Vivian. How are you?
- Hello, June.

01:21:48.659 --> 01:21:49.993
I saw you got married.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.996
- Uh, yes, I did.
- Congratulations, June.

01:21:53.163 --> 01:21:55.290
Thank you. I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

01:21:55.457 --> 01:21:57.459
- So you think this one will stick?
John.

01:21:57.626 --> 01:21:59.336
Is this your third?
John.

01:21:59.503 --> 01:22:01.797
I'm just asking a question.

01:22:01.964 --> 01:22:03.757
Do not do this to me.

01:22:03.924 --> 01:22:05.467
John.

01:22:13.225 --> 01:22:16.562
- Hey, June, wait. I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you, John.

01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:18.647
Hey, excuse me, fella, do you mind?

01:22:20.983 --> 01:22:22.317
You don't look good, John.

01:22:22.818 --> 01:22:25.153
Well, you look real nice.

01:22:25.362 --> 01:22:27.531
So where's your truck driver?

01:22:27.698 --> 01:22:29.575
Stock-car driver.

01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:32.244
You'll be happy to know
things aren't working out.

01:22:32.452 --> 01:22:34.705
It doesn't make me happy.

01:22:35.914 --> 01:22:38.083
Well, a little, it does.

01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:43.714
I wanna tour with you again, June.

01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:46.216
I miss the tour.

01:22:46.383 --> 01:22:47.968
I miss the music.

01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:50.846
I got two growing girls, John.
I can't tour.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:53.515
You're gonna do the comedy
act the rest of your life?

01:22:53.682 --> 01:22:55.976
You got a voice, June. Use it.

01:22:56.185 --> 01:22:58.228
One week a month. That's all.

01:22:58.395 --> 01:22:59.771
All right,
you'll work for me.

01:22:59.938 --> 01:23:03.483
You don't have to worry about bookings,
agents, publicists or anything.

01:23:03.692 --> 01:23:07.779
And if one of your girls get sick,
you stay home and I pay you anyways.

01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:07.905
And if one of your girls get sick,
you stay home and I pay you anyways.

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:18.415
<i>Oh, he taught me to love him</i>
<i>And promised to love</i>

01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:26.089
<i>And to cherish me over</i>
<i>All others above</i>

01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:34.223
<i>How my heart is now wondering</i>
<i>No misery can tell</i>

01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:40.354
<i>He's left me no warning</i>
<i>No words of farewell</i>

01:23:41.855 --> 01:23:48.737
<i>Oh, he taught me to love him</i>
<i>And called me his flower</i>

01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:56.453
<i>That was blooming to cheer him</i>
<i>Through life's dreary hour</i>

01:23:57.496 --> 01:24:04.002
<i>How I long to see him</i>
<i>And regret the dark hour</i>

01:24:04.169 --> 01:24:11.301
<i>He's gone and neglected</i>
<i>This pale wildwood flower</i>

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:30.737
Thank you. That's my
mama's favorite song.

01:24:31.947 --> 01:24:35.534
So y'all sit down, squat down or lie
down, but make yourselves at home...

01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:37.494
...because here's the one and only...

01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:40.414
...Mr. Johnny Cash.

01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:52.885
Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.

01:25:06.565 --> 01:25:09.693
<i>Go away from my window</i>

01:25:10.569 --> 01:25:14.031
<i>Leave at your own chosen speed</i>

01:25:14.489 --> 01:25:18.577
<i>I'm not the one you want, babe</i>

01:25:18.744 --> 01:25:22.789
<i>I'm not the one you need</i>

01:25:22.956 --> 01:25:26.668
<i>- You say you're looking for someone</i>
<i>- You say you're looking for someone</i>

01:25:26.835 --> 01:25:30.923
<i>- Who's never weak but always strong</i>
<i>- Who's never weak but always strong</i>

01:25:31.089 --> 01:25:35.135
<i>- To protect you and defend you</i>
<i>- To protect you and defend you</i>

01:25:35.302 --> 01:25:39.765
<i>- Whether you are right or wrong</i>
<i>- Whether you are right or wrong</i>

01:25:39.932 --> 01:25:43.435
<i>- Someone to open each and every door</i>
<i>- Someone to open each and every door</i>

01:25:43.602 --> 01:25:46.313
<i>- But it ain't me, babe</i>
<i>- But it ain't me, babe</i>

01:25:46.522 --> 01:25:49.775
<i>- No, no, no, it ain't me, babe</i>
<i>- No, no, no, it ain't me, babe</i>

01:25:49.983 --> 01:25:54.488
<i>- It ain't me you're looking for, babe</i>
<i>- It ain't me you're looking for, babe</i>

01:26:19.346 --> 01:26:26.395
<i>You say you're looking for someone</i>
<i>Who'll promise never to part</i>

01:26:27.604 --> 01:26:35.112
<i>Someone to close his eyes to you</i>
<i>Someone to close his heart</i>

01:26:35.988 --> 01:26:39.283

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:52.004
Great show.
- Thank you.

01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:54.673
We loved it.
- It's all June. It's all June.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.884
- Brilliant, John.
Thank you.

01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:59.970
Hi, good to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

01:27:00.137 --> 01:27:01.346
- Hello.
What's next?

01:27:01.513 --> 01:27:03.098
- We're booked in Vegas.
June?

01:27:03.307 --> 01:27:06.393
Yeah?
- I want you to meet my parents.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.562
- That's my mama and my daddy.
- Hi.

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:11.273
How you doing?
- It's so nice to meet you finally.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.691
Hi, I'm June Carter.

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.568
- Miss Carter.
- Nice to meet you.

01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:17.779
You haven't met my little girls,
have you? This is Roseanne...

01:27:17.988 --> 01:27:21.116
Oh, they were sleeping with...
Ain't they sweet?

01:27:21.325 --> 01:27:24.244
You girls are all dressed alike.
I love those yellow ribbons.

01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:26.622
June.
- Yeah?

01:27:26.788 --> 01:27:28.373
Stay clear of my children.

01:27:28.582 --> 01:27:30.876
Vivian, I was just saying hello.
- You heard me.

01:27:31.043 --> 01:27:32.586
Viv.

01:27:33.337 --> 01:27:34.713
- Vivian, please.
- No.

01:27:36.882 --> 01:27:40.677
<i>But ifthey'll laugh at you in Jackson</i>

01:27:40.844 --> 01:27:44.389
<i>I'll be dancing on a pony keg</i>

01:27:44.556 --> 01:27:47.726
<i>They'll lead you 'round town</i>
<i>Like a scolded hound</i>

01:27:47.893 --> 01:27:51.021
<i>With your tail tucked</i>
<i>Between your legs</i>

01:27:51.188 --> 01:27:53.398
<i>You're going to Jackson</i>

01:27:54.566 --> 01:27:56.485
<i>You big-talking man</i>

01:27:57.778 --> 01:28:00.614
<i>And I'll be waiting in Jackson</i>

01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:03.867
<i>Behind my Japan fan</i>

01:28:04.993 --> 01:28:10.123
<i>- Oh, now, we got married in a fever</i>
<i>- We got married in a fever</i>

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:13.669

01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:36.567
Oh, wait, catch it.
Come on, y'all.

01:28:36.733 --> 01:28:39.945
I got this beef jerky.
You're gonna love it, man.

01:28:40.112 --> 01:28:43.198
Nice boots.
High rollers out there?

01:28:51.206 --> 01:28:55.210
Say, officer, how do you get
your shirts to stay that way...

01:28:55.377 --> 01:28:57.713
...so stiff?

01:28:58.714 --> 01:29:00.716
Just starch.

01:29:02.885 --> 01:29:05.929
Huh. It's real nice.

01:29:08.473 --> 01:29:10.184
What?

01:29:10.642 --> 01:29:13.353
- What?
- Are you out of your rabbit-assed mind?

01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:18.025
All right, good night.
- Good night, y'all.

01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:20.194
- Good night.
Give me two, give me two.

01:29:25.282 --> 01:29:27.409
- That was a fun show tonight.
- Yeah, it was.

01:29:27.576 --> 01:29:29.453
- This is my room.
- Right.

01:29:30.913 --> 01:29:33.415
Hey, you wanna have
one of these with me?

01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:35.834
Uh...

01:29:37.377 --> 01:29:39.171
I don't know.

01:30:07.824 --> 01:30:09.576
Can I have one?

01:30:19.169 --> 01:30:22.798
- John.
- All right.

01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:24.466
Wait, wait, here.

01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:26.844
I'll get a good one.

01:30:37.563 --> 01:30:39.147
You know what? You're just mean.

01:30:39.314 --> 01:30:40.941
That's what you are, you're mean.

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:42.860
Here, here.
- You're a mean man.

01:30:43.026 --> 01:30:44.611
Don't say that.
- And I knew it.

01:30:44.778 --> 01:30:46.780
I've known it all along.

01:30:46.947 --> 01:30:49.783
Wait a minute. Here.

01:30:53.871 --> 01:30:56.540
- Come on. Open your mouth.
- No.

01:30:56.707 --> 01:30:58.458
I don't trust you.

01:30:58.667 --> 01:31:01.086
- Don't say that.
- I don't trust you.

01:31:01.253 --> 01:31:03.505
Yes, you do.

01:31:03.922 --> 01:31:09.469
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

01:31:13.932 --> 01:31:16.059
You're so evil. Terrible.

01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:21.106
Oh...

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.694
I suppose I better answer it.

01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:31.658
Hello?

01:31:32.993 --> 01:31:35.954
Oh, hey, Carlene, what's wrong?

01:31:37.706 --> 01:31:41.543
Okay, sweetie, I can't understand what
you're saying, you're crying so hard.

01:31:42.294 --> 01:31:45.339
I know, but you gotta
calm down, honey.

01:31:48.634 --> 01:31:52.012
All right. But everything's okay?

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:56.099
Yeah, I know, sweetie,
sometimes that happens.

01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:58.769
Sweetie, little sisters do
stuff like that sometimes.

01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:01.522
You gotta learn
to be patient with her.

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:15.577
Um, okay, well, um...

01:32:16.787 --> 01:32:20.040
...tell Linda that Mommy said you can
have pancakes on Saturdays.

01:32:20.249 --> 01:32:22.584
- Hey, June, I'm gonna go to my room.
- All right?

01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:26.713
Yeah, I know, sweetie.
I'm gonna come home soon.

01:32:26.922 --> 01:32:28.507
<i>Yeah, sweetie, please don't cry.</i>

01:32:31.343 --> 01:32:34.179
<i>Front desk.</i>
- Hi, could I have June Carter's room?

01:32:34.346 --> 01:32:36.974
<i>Certainly. One moment, sir.</i>

01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:54.449
June.

01:32:57.286 --> 01:32:59.162
It's not wrong, June.

01:32:59.329 --> 01:33:01.248
This ain't wrong.

01:33:02.249 --> 01:33:03.834
June.

01:33:04.251 --> 01:33:08.505
I'm not gonna do this, John.
I'm not gonna do this.

01:33:28.317 --> 01:33:33.155
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:33:34.615 --> 01:33:36.867
Where's Johnny?
Johnny.

01:33:37.034 --> 01:33:39.203
Well, Johnny Cash'll be
out in just a minute.

01:33:39.369 --> 01:33:41.205
He's been detained for just a minute.

01:33:41.371 --> 01:33:43.874
But we're gonna keep
you entertained till then.

01:33:44.041 --> 01:33:45.709
And we're gonna play a wonderful...

01:33:45.876 --> 01:33:47.836
Hold on, hold on. Johnny's here.

01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:49.379
Yeah.

01:33:50.047 --> 01:33:53.217
Here he is, Mr. Johnny Cash.

01:33:54.218 --> 01:33:55.969
Hi, folks, I'm Johnny Cash.

01:33:56.136 --> 01:33:59.348
What about that June Carter,
ain't she a sweetheart?

01:33:59.556 --> 01:34:02.643
"I Got Stripes."
"I Got Stripes."

01:34:23.163 --> 01:34:27.042
<i>On a Monday, I was arrested</i>

01:34:27.626 --> 01:34:30.963
<i>On a Tuesday, they locked me in jail</i>

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.676
<i>On a Wednesday, my trial was attested</i>

01:34:35.843 --> 01:34:40.055
<i>And on a Thursday, they said, "Guilty"</i>
<i>And the judge's gavel fell</i>

01:34:40.222 --> 01:34:44.393
<i>I got stripes</i>
<i>Stripes around my shoulders</i>

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:48.564
<i>I got chains</i>
<i>Chains around my feet</i>

01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:53.026
<i>I got stripes</i>
<i>Stripes around my shoulders</i>

01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:55.237
<i>And them chains</i>
<i>Them chains</i>

01:34:55.445 --> 01:34:57.823
<i>They're about to drag me down</i>

01:35:02.035 --> 01:35:05.622
Get it on, man.
Play the fucking thing.

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:09.001
<i>I got my... just got our britches</i>

01:35:09.209 --> 01:35:13.297
<i>On a Tuesday, I got my ball and chain</i>

01:35:13.463 --> 01:35:16.133
<i>On a Wednesday, my trial</i>

01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:22.139
<i>On a Thurs...</i>
<i>They had to knock me down</i>

01:35:22.347 --> 01:35:23.724
<i>I got stripes</i>

01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:31.106
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:35:34.443 --> 01:35:36.486
Oh, my God. John.

01:35:36.945 --> 01:35:39.865
- Close the curtain. John. John.
Get a doctor.

01:35:40.073 --> 01:35:41.408
Put the curtain back.

01:35:41.617 --> 01:35:43.202
Come on, pull him back.

01:35:43.410 --> 01:35:45.704
J.R., you okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:49.041
J.R., look at me.
John.

01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:55.172
"Fortunately, I was keeping my feathers
numbered for just such an emergency."

01:35:58.509 --> 01:36:00.636
Let's get some help.
- Junie? June?

01:36:00.802 --> 01:36:03.430
Come on, get him some help.

01:36:21.031 --> 01:36:23.325
- Yeah?
J. R?

01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:25.410
What?

01:36:27.996 --> 01:36:29.498
J.R.

01:36:34.711 --> 01:36:36.672
The tour's been canceled, John.

01:36:38.507 --> 01:36:39.842
Who says?

01:36:40.968 --> 01:36:44.721
We got you a ticket home, John.
Tomorrow.

01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:46.557
You see where I'm putting it?

01:36:47.808 --> 01:36:49.309
Right here by the phone.

01:36:55.732 --> 01:36:57.693
Take care of yourself, John.

01:37:14.126 --> 01:37:16.253
You're burning up.

01:37:18.881 --> 01:37:22.259
Got hotter places than my forehead.

01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:28.390
Tell me you don't love me.

01:37:32.269 --> 01:37:34.438
I don't love you.

01:37:35.856 --> 01:37:37.941
You're a liar.

01:37:38.567 --> 01:37:41.904
Well, then I guess you ain't
got no problems, do you?

01:37:52.497 --> 01:37:54.499
- Where are my pills?
- Flushed them all.

01:37:54.666 --> 01:37:56.877
June... Junie, don't say that.

01:37:58.045 --> 01:38:00.881
Now, hold on. I... I... I need those.

01:38:01.048 --> 01:38:05.677
I need those pills. Listen, that's just,
baby... Those are my prescriptions.

01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:10.057
From the doctor. Okay?
I need... I need those.

01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:21.276
Now, I know... I...

01:38:46.134 --> 01:38:48.262
It burns...

01:38:48.428 --> 01:38:51.348
...burns, burns.

01:38:55.644 --> 01:38:57.938
Mommy.

01:38:58.105 --> 01:39:00.274
Mommy.

01:39:09.825 --> 01:39:12.244
Few more minutes, pal.

01:39:18.375 --> 01:39:20.252
There you go.

01:39:27.885 --> 01:39:32.806
<i>The taste of love is sweet</i>

01:39:37.102 --> 01:39:42.274
<i>And it burns, burns, burns, burns</i>

01:39:48.906 --> 01:39:53.452
<i>Then it burns, burns, burns, burns</i>

01:39:53.619 --> 01:39:57.080
<i>The ring of fire</i>

01:39:58.874 --> 01:40:01.376
<i>The ring of fire</i>

01:40:09.092 --> 01:40:13.847
Now boarding,
<i>flight 1919. Service to San Jose.</i>

01:40:14.014 --> 01:40:17.100
<i>At this time, we'd like</i>
<i>to see a boarding pass.</i>

01:40:19.937 --> 01:40:25.609
<i>Final boarding call for flight 57.</i>
<i>Now boarding at gate 7.</i>

01:40:32.449 --> 01:40:33.825
Mr. Cash.

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.257
You wanna take these strings off,
or do you want us to break it?

01:41:17.119 --> 01:41:18.161
There he is.

01:41:24.418 --> 01:41:26.587
What kind of trouble is there?

01:41:26.795 --> 01:41:29.339
- Your career, Mr. Cash?

01:41:29.506 --> 01:41:31.758
Right this way.
Mr. Cash?

01:41:33.468 --> 01:41:35.470
Right here.
Come on, John.

01:42:02.664 --> 01:42:07.002
Your mama was here. Your daddy too.

01:42:07.586 --> 01:42:09.588
What'd he say?

01:42:09.922 --> 01:42:11.924
Said now you won't have to work
so hard...

01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:14.468
...to make people think
you've been to jail.

01:42:25.938 --> 01:42:28.690
- Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

01:42:28.857 --> 01:42:30.651
You okay?

01:42:31.985 --> 01:42:35.531
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:42:37.241 --> 01:42:38.867
I'll see you in the morning.

01:43:03.892 --> 01:43:06.520
Cindy doesn't like mustard.

01:43:12.651 --> 01:43:15.654
The pills were legal, Viv.
You know, I got prescriptions.

01:43:15.821 --> 01:43:18.991
You're not supposed to buy them
across the border, that's all.

01:43:19.157 --> 01:43:22.369
Other than that, it's fine.

01:43:22.536 --> 01:43:25.831
- So the radio's lying?
- Yeah.

01:43:25.998 --> 01:43:28.876
- The TV's lying.
- Baby, they'll say anything.

01:43:29.042 --> 01:43:32.212
Your lawyer's lying. Luther's lying.

01:43:32.379 --> 01:43:36.175
- Marshall's lying. Your manager.
- Viv, I don't wanna fight.

01:43:37.759 --> 01:43:40.053
What about June?

01:43:40.804 --> 01:43:43.682
Does she think it's fine her
new boy's a drug addict?

01:43:43.849 --> 01:43:47.644
She left the tour, Viv. In Vegas.

01:43:50.063 --> 01:43:52.816
Well, that explains everything,
doesn't it?

01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:07.497
<i>God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"</i>

01:44:07.664 --> 01:44:10.959
<i>- Abe said, "You must be puttin' me on"</i>
- John.

01:44:11.126 --> 01:44:14.087
<i>God say, "No"</i>
<i>Abe say, "What?"</i>

01:44:14.254 --> 01:44:17.007
<i>God say, "You can do</i>
<i>What you want, Abe</i>

01:44:17.174 --> 01:44:21.053
<i>But the next time you see me comin'</i>
<i>You better run"</i>

01:44:25.432 --> 01:44:27.351
John, what are you doing?

01:44:27.518 --> 01:44:29.728
It's 7 a.m.

01:44:31.271 --> 01:44:33.732
The kids are getting ready for school.

01:44:34.566 --> 01:44:36.860
Just hanging pictures.

01:44:46.203 --> 01:44:48.622
John, please don't hang these.

01:44:48.914 --> 01:44:52.000
Viv, they're pictures of my band.

01:44:52.543 --> 01:44:55.003
Don't hang these.

01:44:56.964 --> 01:44:59.132
- No, don't hang these.
- Let go of the picture.

01:44:59.341 --> 01:45:02.636
- I said, please don't hang these, John.
- Viv.

01:45:02.803 --> 01:45:04.429
No.

01:45:04.638 --> 01:45:07.891
Viv, get back here. Viv.

01:45:08.058 --> 01:45:10.227
Viv, get back here.

01:45:10.769 --> 01:45:14.481
- Viv, I ain't kidding.
- No.

01:45:19.027 --> 01:45:22.072
Vivian, give me the damn picture.

01:45:23.115 --> 01:45:27.828
- Viv, give me the pic...
- No.

01:45:28.036 --> 01:45:32.416
Hey, Viv, wa... Don't do that.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:37.629
- Now, stop it. Baby, stop it. All right...
- You. You pathetic excuse for a man.

01:45:37.838 --> 01:45:40.507
She will find out, you liar.
She'll find out.

01:45:41.133 --> 01:45:43.385
She'll find out, John.

01:45:43.552 --> 01:45:45.637
- You liar.
- Stop it.

01:45:45.804 --> 01:45:47.472
- No.
- You think you're perfect?

01:45:47.639 --> 01:45:52.019
- You think you're perfect? Huh? Huh?
- No. No.

01:45:55.898 --> 01:45:57.441
No.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.363
No.

01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:05.824
No.

01:46:05.991 --> 01:46:07.910
No.

01:46:17.211 --> 01:46:18.462
I'm coming.

01:46:22.424 --> 01:46:25.052
Shut the door...

01:46:35.521 --> 01:46:39.775
Hey, you leave them out of this.
Viv. You leave them out of this.

01:46:39.942 --> 01:46:43.070
Girls. Girls. No.

01:46:44.154 --> 01:46:45.948
Girls.

01:46:59.545 --> 01:47:06.176
<i>I'm a long way from home</i>

01:47:07.511 --> 01:47:11.640
<i>And so all alone</i>

01:47:12.182 --> 01:47:17.521
<i>Homesick like I never thought I'd be</i>

01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:26.363
<i>I'm a long way from home</i>

01:47:27.739 --> 01:47:31.577
<i>Everything is wrong</i>

01:47:32.244 --> 01:47:37.749
<i>Someone please watch over me</i>

01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:49.928
Thirty hours.

01:47:57.019 --> 01:47:59.980
You've been asleep for 30 hours, hoss.

01:48:00.606 --> 01:48:02.649
Hey, did June call?

01:48:04.318 --> 01:48:07.696
Woman won't return my damn calls.

01:48:14.328 --> 01:48:17.164
They disconnected it yesterday.

01:48:17.372 --> 01:48:19.750
Insufficient "fundilation."

01:48:20.667 --> 01:48:22.920
Now, come on, man.
I gave you money for that.

01:48:23.086 --> 01:48:25.714
Well, that was last month.
This is this month.

01:48:29.551 --> 01:48:34.223
You see, I'm a little
behind right now...

01:48:34.389 --> 01:48:37.768
...and I need this to
turn my phone back on.

01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:39.895
Because I need to talk to my woman.

01:48:40.062 --> 01:48:44.191
You see, I'm in love with a woman and I
need to talk to her, you understand?

01:48:44.358 --> 01:48:47.194
I need this to get my
car out of the shop.

01:48:47.361 --> 01:48:49.988
And she lives way,
way out on the edge of town.

01:48:50.155 --> 01:48:52.616
It's the Bataan Death March
to get there, you see?

01:48:52.783 --> 01:48:56.537
So if you'll just go ahead
and cash this.

01:48:56.703 --> 01:48:58.705
I'm sorry, Mr. Cash.

01:48:58.872 --> 01:49:01.375
- You know who I am.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:01.583 --> 01:49:04.878
Okay, then just please
cash my check for me.

01:49:05.045 --> 01:49:09.049
The bank puts an automatic
hold on checks like this.

01:49:09.383 --> 01:49:11.718
It's a large amount.

01:49:12.302 --> 01:49:15.013
If you can't cash it,
then it's just a piece of paper.

01:49:15.222 --> 01:49:17.766
- Oh, don't do that. Please...
- Why? You can't cash it.

01:49:17.933 --> 01:49:20.727
It ain't nothing.
Just a damn piece of paper.

01:49:30.279 --> 01:49:33.490
Mama, Johnny Cash is here.

01:49:36.493 --> 01:49:38.453
Hey, girls.

01:49:39.329 --> 01:49:43.250
- Hey, Carlene, you look real nice.
- Hey, Johnny.

01:49:43.417 --> 01:49:46.587
- Mama, Johnny Cash is here.
- Hi, Mother Maybelle.

01:49:47.212 --> 01:49:49.089
Hey, John.

01:49:49.256 --> 01:49:50.591
How are you doing?

01:49:50.799 --> 01:49:52.718
Doing all right.

01:49:53.969 --> 01:49:55.470
Hi, June.

01:49:56.221 --> 01:49:57.556
Hi, John.

01:49:57.723 --> 01:50:01.351
Hey, girls can you go inside the
living room and clean up that mess?

01:50:01.518 --> 01:50:03.687
All right, honey.
- I tried to call, June...

01:50:03.854 --> 01:50:06.315
...but I think there's something
wrong with your phone.

01:50:06.481 --> 01:50:08.066
Look at you.

01:50:08.233 --> 01:50:10.277
Have you looked in a mirror lately?

01:50:10.652 --> 01:50:13.155
How are you gonna sing
when you can't even talk?

01:50:13.322 --> 01:50:17.284
"I got the laryngitis." Remember?

01:50:18.869 --> 01:50:21.538
- Marry me, June.
- Oh, please. Get up off your knees.

01:50:21.705 --> 01:50:23.874
You look pathetic. Come on.

01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:26.376
I don't want my girls
seeing somebody like this.

01:50:26.543 --> 01:50:29.630
- Come on, baby.
- Where's my friend John?

01:50:30.255 --> 01:50:33.967
What'd he get, high? Or is he incognito?
Is he gone?

01:50:34.134 --> 01:50:36.136
Because I don't like this guy Cash.

01:50:36.803 --> 01:50:39.473
I ain't incognito.

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.309
I'm right here. You see?

01:50:42.476 --> 01:50:45.479
- I'm here.
- Fine. Where's your car?

01:50:45.896 --> 01:50:47.731
It's in make up.

01:50:47.898 --> 01:50:50.859
- You walked here?
- Yeah.

01:50:51.026 --> 01:50:53.237
You walked here all the
way from Nashville?

01:50:53.403 --> 01:50:57.199
Yeah, well, walking's good for you.
See, I'm trying to get in shape, June.

01:50:57.407 --> 01:51:01.328
It cleans out your system.
Well, it's a spiritual thing.

01:51:01.495 --> 01:51:03.872
I'm on a love walk.

01:51:04.039 --> 01:51:07.918
- The June Carter love walk. Immemorial.
- You know what?

01:51:08.085 --> 01:51:10.420
I am supporting more than
myself right now.

01:51:10.587 --> 01:51:12.631
Please do not blow another tour.

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.175
Oh, June, love's more
important than a tour.

01:51:15.342 --> 01:51:16.885
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

01:51:17.052 --> 01:51:21.098
Well, then start loving yourself.
So we can go back to work.

01:51:21.932 --> 01:51:23.725
All right, June.

01:51:23.892 --> 01:51:26.562
Hey, you keep your phone on,
and I will too.

01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:28.730
I'll call.

01:51:30.774 --> 01:51:32.818
I'll call you.

01:51:34.027 --> 01:51:36.196
When you're feeling better, I'll call.

01:51:44.121 --> 01:51:47.791
Oh. Oh, come on.

01:51:49.626 --> 01:51:52.421
Listen, you know,
times like this, I say to myself...

01:51:52.588 --> 01:51:55.674
...I say, "Jack, what would
the baby Jesus do?"

01:52:00.304 --> 01:52:03.098
- That's your name? Jack?
- Mm-hm. Jack.

01:52:04.516 --> 01:52:06.894
Shit, I need another drink.

01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:11.857
Ahh. I am lit up of the spirit.
Yes, sir, Jack needs another drink.

01:52:28.874 --> 01:52:34.796
<i>June Carter, June Carter</i>
<i>Would you give me some time?</i>

01:52:34.963 --> 01:52:41.178
<i>How much longer will it be till</i>
<i>Till I can call you mine?</i>

01:52:41.345 --> 01:52:47.893
<i>When you see Johnny, would you tell him</i>
<i>That you're gonna stick around?</i>

01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:51.438
<i>And then Johnny will buy you</i>

01:52:52.272 --> 01:52:55.526
<i>A nice white gown</i>

01:53:52.624 --> 01:53:54.960
Hey, that's a beautiful house.

01:54:07.806 --> 01:54:09.600
Hey, man.

01:54:11.476 --> 01:54:12.895
Beautiful place, man.

01:54:13.061 --> 01:54:14.438
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

01:54:24.907 --> 01:54:26.742
Hello?
- June?

01:54:26.909 --> 01:54:29.536
- Hey, it's John.
<i>- Hi.</i>

01:54:29.703 --> 01:54:32.414
Hey. How you doing?

01:54:32.581 --> 01:54:35.792
<i>I'm fine, John. How are you?</i>

01:54:35.959 --> 01:54:39.338
Uh, doing a lot better than
last time you saw me.

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.840
<i>Well, that's good.</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>

01:54:42.007 --> 01:54:45.010
<i>- You still taking those pills?</i>
- No.

01:54:45.177 --> 01:54:48.805
That was, you know... That was
a rough patch there, June.

01:54:48.972 --> 01:54:52.059
I just needed to,
you know, get some time.

01:54:52.226 --> 01:54:54.102
I'm doing better,
though, now, you know?

01:54:54.269 --> 01:54:56.438
I got out of that apartment...

01:54:56.605 --> 01:55:00.150
...and got this place out
in Hendersonville on a lake. Big spread.

01:55:00.317 --> 01:55:03.612
<i>- I heard that.</i>
- Yeah, I'm...

01:55:04.196 --> 01:55:07.199
...trying to get things together.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

01:55:08.825 --> 01:55:11.578
<i>Are you alone on Thanksgiving, John?</i>

01:55:12.663 --> 01:55:16.166
Yeah... My folks are coming
down with Reba and Roseanne...

01:55:16.333 --> 01:55:20.796
...and I got this big bird, but I don't
know when to put it in the oven...

01:55:20.963 --> 01:55:23.423
...or really what
temperature to set it at or...

01:55:23.590 --> 01:55:24.883
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:55:28.095 --> 01:55:30.013
It is beautiful.
Really lucky.

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:33.350
I'm really proud of you.
- You see? It goes from right up there...

01:55:33.517 --> 01:55:36.353
...clear across halfway around the lake.
- Yeah.

01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.523
What's going on down
there with that tractor?

01:55:41.191 --> 01:55:44.987
Uh, I got it stuck. I was trying to pull
this stump, and I come up...

01:55:45.153 --> 01:55:47.114
Doing something dangerous.
- Yeah, but...

01:55:47.281 --> 01:55:49.950
That's a fine piece of equipment to
leave in that mud.

01:55:50.158 --> 01:55:53.078
Is that the way you take care
of your things?

01:55:58.333 --> 01:55:59.376
Hey.

01:56:00.252 --> 01:56:01.461
Thanksgiving, okay?

01:56:01.628 --> 01:56:03.213
Look at this.
Hey.

01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:05.007
Hey.
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:56:05.174 --> 01:56:06.758
Here, Carlene.

01:56:06.925 --> 01:56:08.594
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey, John.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.304
Hi.
- I like this place here.

01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:13.182
Oh, thanks. Hey, Rosie.
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:56:13.348 --> 01:56:14.683
Thank you.
- Hey.

01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:17.352
Let's go and meet John's...
- House is beautiful.

01:56:17.519 --> 01:56:20.230
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

01:56:21.690 --> 01:56:23.692
- John, how you doing?
Let me help you.

01:56:23.942 --> 01:56:26.945
- That's my mama, Carrie.
- Maybelle Carter, Happy Thanksgiving.

01:56:27.112 --> 01:56:29.072
- This is my daddy, Ray.
- How you doing?

01:56:29.239 --> 01:56:31.366
- Good to meet you.
- My mama, Carrie.

01:56:31.533 --> 01:56:33.952
- How do you do?
- Carrie was gonna cook for y'all...

01:56:34.119 --> 01:56:36.788
...but J.R., he doesn't have
a pot or a pan, so...

01:56:36.997 --> 01:56:38.582
We're happy to share our food.

01:56:38.749 --> 01:56:40.459
I just moved in, you know.

01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:42.002
Thanks.
- Come inside.

01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:44.963
If you gonna get out on big
water like lakes or a river...

01:56:45.172 --> 01:56:48.133
...you're gonna need something
you can cast out pretty good.

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:50.511
If you haven't got one,
I'm gonna tell you...

01:56:50.677 --> 01:56:52.596
...you need to get you a Zebco 33.

01:56:52.763 --> 01:56:55.265
That's about the best
reels you can get.

01:56:55.432 --> 01:56:58.769
Don't tangle up much, and you can cast
them about as far as you want.

01:56:58.936 --> 01:57:03.148
There in them little farm ponds, you
don't need nothing but a cane pole...

01:57:03.357 --> 01:57:07.027
...and a float and maybe some crickets
or worms, if you can dig them up.

01:57:07.194 --> 01:57:08.403
That's all we ever had.

01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:12.533
The Zebco 33 is probably your best bet.
I bought June one when she was 12.

01:57:12.699 --> 01:57:15.244
- Remember that?
- That's right. I caught a lot of fish.

01:57:15.452 --> 01:57:16.912
You sure did.

01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.374
So, what do you think, Daddy?

01:57:21.083 --> 01:57:22.876
About what?

01:57:25.754 --> 01:57:28.006
About the house.

01:57:33.262 --> 01:57:35.597
It's a fine big house, John.

01:57:35.806 --> 01:57:38.892
- Thanks.
- It's not as big as Jack Benny's.

01:57:39.059 --> 01:57:41.520
What, you been to Jack Benny's, Ray?

01:57:42.479 --> 01:57:44.439
Saw it on the TV.

01:57:44.648 --> 01:57:49.069
Carrie, I was meaning to ask you,
did you teach the boys to play?

01:57:49.236 --> 01:57:53.574
Well, J.R. Always sang pretty, but I
don't think I could take credit for it.

01:57:54.032 --> 01:57:56.785
I'll bet you did. I bet you
learned the same way I did.

01:57:56.994 --> 01:58:00.622
Oh, out of the hymnals, sure.
I knew you'd say that.

01:58:00.789 --> 01:58:04.710
You know, you'd be surprised how many
musicians can't read shape notes.

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:06.628
I can't imagine.
I know.

01:58:06.795 --> 01:58:10.716
But my husband's uncle, E.M. Bayes,
he taught me with hymnals too.

01:58:10.924 --> 01:58:14.428
Well, how about you, John?
You know how to read shape notes?

01:58:16.597 --> 01:58:18.390
John.

01:58:18.932 --> 01:58:20.642
Mama asked you a question, John.

01:58:20.809 --> 01:58:24.354
I'm really glad y'all
could be here today.

01:58:24.771 --> 01:58:26.815
Especially you, Daddy.

01:58:26.982 --> 01:58:28.901
Glad he came...

01:58:29.067 --> 01:58:32.196
...to dinner,
and Thanksgiving, and all.

01:58:36.533 --> 01:58:39.244
Not everybody's here.

01:58:43.332 --> 01:58:45.918
Jack's not here, is he?

01:58:47.586 --> 01:58:48.962
Huh?

01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:52.925
"Where you been?"

01:58:56.970 --> 01:59:00.140
That's what you said to me.
Remember?

01:59:04.811 --> 01:59:07.189
And I was 12 years old...

01:59:08.649 --> 01:59:11.944
...youse got Jack's bloody clothes...

01:59:13.195 --> 01:59:15.739
...and you says to me,
"Where you been?"

01:59:17.199 --> 01:59:18.992
Well...

01:59:19.785 --> 01:59:21.495
...where were you?

01:59:22.871 --> 01:59:24.873
Where were you?

01:59:30.504 --> 01:59:33.841
I quit drinking a long time ago, J.R.

01:59:34.007 --> 01:59:36.844
What about you?
You still taking them pills?

01:59:38.011 --> 01:59:42.641
- That'll kill you, you know.
- Yeah, well, so will a car wreck.

01:59:44.685 --> 01:59:47.688
You're sitting on a high horse, boy.

01:59:48.564 --> 01:59:51.650
I never had talent. I did the
best I could with what I had.

01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:53.861
Can you say that?

01:59:54.027 --> 01:59:56.530
Mister Big Shot?
Mister Pill-Popping Rock Star?

01:59:56.738 --> 01:59:59.157
- Ray.
Who are you to judge?

01:59:59.366 --> 02:00:03.453
You ain't got nothing.
Big empty house. Nothing.

02:00:03.662 --> 02:00:06.915
Children you don't see. Nothing.

02:00:07.082 --> 02:00:10.502
Big old expensive tractor
stuck in the mud.

02:00:11.086 --> 02:00:12.963
Nothing.

02:00:35.444 --> 02:00:37.362
Come on.

02:00:38.572 --> 02:00:42.409
Let's do it. Come on.

02:00:42.618 --> 02:00:46.330
You is a son of a bitch, ain't you?
Come on.

02:00:48.415 --> 02:00:49.833
Do it, do it.

02:00:50.584 --> 02:00:52.294
Come on.

02:00:54.213 --> 02:00:56.131
Come on.

02:01:00.636 --> 02:01:02.554
I'm gonna sit in the middle this time.

02:01:02.721 --> 02:01:05.307
Come on, you son of a bitch.

02:01:06.433 --> 02:01:08.936
- John?
A fine piece of equipment, huh?

02:01:09.102 --> 02:01:12.689
- John.
Come on.

02:01:14.358 --> 02:01:16.944
You should go down to him.
Mama.

02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:19.613
- He's mixed up.
- I am not going down there.

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:23.617
- If I go down there...
- You already are down there, honey.

02:01:30.791 --> 02:01:33.252
Let's do it. Let's do it.

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.716
John.

02:01:40.175 --> 02:01:41.343
John.

02:01:42.469 --> 02:01:44.388
John.

02:01:44.763 --> 02:01:47.599
John. John.

02:01:48.267 --> 02:01:50.018
- John.
- Aah!

02:01:50.853 --> 02:01:54.147
John. John.

02:02:02.072 --> 02:02:04.658
- June?
Come on.

02:02:16.461 --> 02:02:19.339
You should have left me.

02:03:54.726 --> 02:03:56.645
John?

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:59.857
<i>Go on ahead, J.R.</i>

02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:01.483
<i>You know what that is?</i>

02:04:02.734 --> 02:04:05.362
<i>Just please get away from me.</i>

02:04:05.529 --> 02:04:07.155
<i>Daddy?</i>

02:04:07.364 --> 02:04:08.949
John?

02:04:10.284 --> 02:04:12.119
Hey, John?

02:04:12.369 --> 02:04:16.331
Oh, shit. Jesus. Hey...
What...? Hey, John?

02:04:16.498 --> 02:04:18.667
Get your ass out of here, boy.
- Hey, John.

02:04:18.876 --> 02:04:21.003
Get out.
Take your poison with you.

02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:23.380
Okay. I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:44.276
Hey.

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:50.449
Mom and I picked
these up down the road.

02:04:50.616 --> 02:04:52.326
They're good.

02:05:15.724 --> 02:05:18.393
It's good to see you again.

02:05:19.686 --> 02:05:21.480
Can I get you something else?

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:23.774
Just stay.

02:05:24.858 --> 02:05:26.693
Okay.

02:05:29.863 --> 02:05:32.449
You're an angel.

02:05:34.409 --> 02:05:36.078
No, I'm not.

02:05:36.578 --> 02:05:39.081
You've been here with me.

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:43.001
I had a friend who needed help.

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:45.337
You're my friend.

02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:51.051
But I done so many bad things.

02:05:51.218 --> 02:05:54.388
You done a few. That's true.

02:05:58.475 --> 02:06:01.144
My daddy's right.

02:06:02.521 --> 02:06:05.691
Should have been me on that saw.

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:15.117
Jack was so good.

02:06:15.784 --> 02:06:19.079
He would have done
so many good things.

02:06:19.246 --> 02:06:21.832
What have I done?

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:26.461
Just hurt everybody I know.

02:06:30.716 --> 02:06:33.385
I know I've hurt you.

02:06:39.308 --> 02:06:41.518
I'm nothing.

02:06:44.313 --> 02:06:46.815
You're not nothing.

02:06:49.276 --> 02:06:51.695
You are not nothing.

02:06:52.988 --> 02:06:55.199
You're a good man.

02:06:56.575 --> 02:07:00.913
And God has given you a second
chance to make things right, John.

02:07:02.331 --> 02:07:05.125
This is your chance, honey.

02:07:08.003 --> 02:07:10.714
This is your chance.

02:07:29.858 --> 02:07:32.069
Hi, how are y'all?

02:07:36.114 --> 02:07:38.033
Could you...?

02:07:40.410 --> 02:07:43.997
It's okay. Come on.

02:07:53.048 --> 02:07:55.676
- The evidence of things not seen.

02:07:55.843 --> 02:07:59.596
By faith, Abel offered God a better gift...

02:07:59.763 --> 02:08:03.058
...than his brother, Cain.
Better by faith.

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:10.107
Cain left God. Cain fell from faith.

02:08:11.108 --> 02:08:15.654
He went out from the Lord
and he dwelt in the land of Nod...

02:08:16.947 --> 02:08:19.241
...on the east of Eden.

02:08:20.367 --> 02:08:22.619
Amen.

02:08:22.953 --> 02:08:25.330
Let's all rise.

02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:13.790
What about the Tropicana?
What's wrong with the Opry?

02:11:13.957 --> 02:11:17.002
He was banned after he
smashed up the footlights.

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:21.048
Well, if he smashes lights at Folsom,
they're gonna keep him there.

02:11:21.215 --> 02:11:26.428
Look, Frank, while Johnny was
out recuperating, the world changed.

02:11:26.595 --> 02:11:28.764
Dylan's gone electric.

02:11:28.931 --> 02:11:32.309
The Byrds are electric, the Beatles are
electric. Hell, everybody's electric.

02:11:32.768 --> 02:11:35.229
He needs a fresh sound,
and all he wants to do...

02:11:35.395 --> 02:11:37.940
...is cut a live album with
the same old pickers...

02:11:38.106 --> 02:11:40.609
...at a maximum security penitentiary.

02:11:40.776 --> 02:11:43.403
You can talk to me, you know.
I'm standing right here.

02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:46.073
And what's with the black?
It's depressing.

02:11:46.532 --> 02:11:48.450
Looks like you're going to a funeral.

02:11:49.409 --> 02:11:51.578
Maybe I am.

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.541
Your fans are church folk, Johnny.

02:11:55.791 --> 02:11:57.125
Christians.

02:11:57.292 --> 02:11:58.961
They don't wanna
hear you singing...

02:11:59.127 --> 02:12:02.923
...to a bunch of murderers and rapists,
trying to cheer them up.

02:12:05.843 --> 02:12:08.303
Well, they're not Christians then.

02:12:09.263 --> 02:12:11.265
I'm fine with you doing a live record.

02:12:11.473 --> 02:12:15.227
Just not at a prison.
That's my compromise.

02:12:21.108 --> 02:12:23.360
January 13th...

02:12:23.527 --> 02:12:27.739
...l'll be at Folsom Prison
with June and the boys.

02:12:28.198 --> 02:12:30.200
You listen to the tapes.

02:12:30.367 --> 02:12:34.454
If you don't like them, toss them.

02:12:43.964 --> 02:12:46.008
Mr. Cash?

02:12:46.175 --> 02:12:48.218
M... Mr. Cash?

02:12:49.303 --> 02:12:50.804
Mr. Cash?

02:12:52.514 --> 02:12:55.517
Might I suggest you refrain from
playing any more tunes...

02:12:55.684 --> 02:13:02.816
...that remind them, the inmates, that is,
that, well... That they're in prison.

02:13:03.901 --> 02:13:06.236
You think they forgot?

02:13:06.653 --> 02:13:09.156
Perhaps you and your wife
could do another spiritual.

02:13:10.282 --> 02:13:12.743
That's not my wife, warden.

02:13:14.745 --> 02:13:17.414
I keep asking her,
and she keeps saying no.

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:25.964
You ever drink this water, warden?

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:30.928
No. No, I'm a Coca-Cola man.

02:13:48.362 --> 02:13:50.864
All right.

02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:05.504
I wanna remind you we're
recording live here today...

02:14:05.671 --> 02:14:08.549
...so you can't say hell or shit
or anything like that.

02:14:11.635 --> 02:14:15.097
I gotta tell you, I can't tell you
how many shows we've done...

02:14:15.264 --> 02:14:17.474
...but this is the best
audience we ever had.

02:14:17.641 --> 02:14:19.560
I wanna thank you for that.

02:14:23.814 --> 02:14:28.026
You know, standing back there in
your shop, catching my breath...

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:30.988
...I come to admire you even more.

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:34.074
You see, I never had to
do hard time like you.

02:14:34.241 --> 02:14:36.618
Although I have, on occasion...

02:14:36.827 --> 02:14:38.954
...got myself busted.

02:14:40.122 --> 02:14:43.834
Once in El Paso I had this bag of...
Oh, you heard about that?

02:14:44.001 --> 02:14:46.044
You been in El Paso too?

02:14:46.211 --> 02:14:48.672
Well, anyways I felt tough,
you know?

02:14:48.839 --> 02:14:52.176
Like I'd seen a thing or two,
you know?

02:14:54.178 --> 02:14:56.471
Well, that was till a moment ago.

02:14:56.638 --> 02:15:00.684
Because I gotta tell you,
my hat's off to you now.

02:15:00.851 --> 02:15:05.814
Because I ain't never had to drink this
yellow water you got here at Folsom.

02:15:15.157 --> 02:15:17.576
This song is for your warden.

02:15:17.743 --> 02:15:21.455
<i>Early one mornin'</i>
<i>While makin' the rounds</i>

02:15:21.622 --> 02:15:25.334
<i>I took a shot of cocaine</i>
<i>And I shot my woman down</i>

02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:29.171
<i>I went right home and I went to bed</i>

02:15:29.338 --> 02:15:33.509
<i>I stuck that lovin' forty-four</i>
<i>Beneath my head</i>

02:15:33.759 --> 02:15:37.095
<i>Got up next mornin'</i>
<i>And I grabbed that gun</i>

02:15:37.262 --> 02:15:41.433
<i>Took a shot of cocaine and away I run</i>

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.853
<i>Made a good run but I run too slow</i>

02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:48.607
<i>They overtook me</i>
<i>Down in JuÃ¡rez, Mexico</i>

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:53.153
<i>Late in the hot joint takin' the pills</i>

02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:56.573
<i>In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill</i>

02:15:56.740 --> 02:16:00.702
<i>He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not</i>
<i>Jack Brown"</i>

02:16:00.869 --> 02:16:04.623
<i>"You're the dirty hack that</i>
<i>Shot your woman down"</i>

02:16:05.958 --> 02:16:07.751
I was dressed in black.

02:16:08.710 --> 02:16:11.922
<i>When I was arrested</i>
<i>I was dressed in black</i>

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:16.468
<i>They put me on a train</i>
<i>And they took me back</i>

02:16:16.677 --> 02:16:19.888
<i>Had no friend for to go my bail</i>

02:16:20.097 --> 02:16:24.101
<i>They slapped my dried-up carcass</i>
<i>In the county jail</i>

02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:28.313
<i>The judge, he smiled</i>
<i>As he picked up his pen</i>

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.234
<i>Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen</i>

02:16:32.567 --> 02:16:36.029
<i>Ninety-nine years underneath that ground</i>

02:16:36.237 --> 02:16:39.741
<i>I can't forget the day</i>
<i>I shot that bad bitch down</i>

02:16:40.367 --> 02:16:43.829
<i>Come on, you gotta listen unto me</i>

02:16:43.995 --> 02:16:48.959
<i>Lay off that whiskey</i>
<i>And let that cocaine be</i>

02:16:50.294 --> 02:16:52.379
All right!

02:17:16.153 --> 02:17:18.112
In the back.

02:17:37.841 --> 02:17:39.800
Hey, June.

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:44.056
June.

02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:48.644
What's wrong, John?

02:17:49.352 --> 02:17:53.857
I don't know. Bad dreams. Memories.

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:58.070
Well, you need to get
some rest, sweetie.

02:17:58.904 --> 02:18:01.114
You did good tonight.

02:18:01.281 --> 02:18:05.201
- But we got another show tomorrow.
- Yeah.

02:18:05.369 --> 02:18:07.995
Hey, listen.

02:18:08.205 --> 02:18:12.459
The thing is, I think it's time now.

02:18:12.626 --> 02:18:14.419
You know? I think it's about time.

02:18:14.585 --> 02:18:17.548
- Time for what?
- For you and me...

02:18:18.382 --> 02:18:19.924
...to get married.

02:18:22.886 --> 02:18:25.305
Go to sleep, John.

02:18:26.181 --> 02:18:27.933
I don't wanna sleep.

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:31.520
I wanna marry you,
and I'm telling you it's the time.

02:18:32.271 --> 02:18:37.692
Well, I am telling you with 100
percent certainty that it is not the time.

02:18:38.235 --> 02:18:40.070
It's not about time.

02:18:40.236 --> 02:18:43.906
It's not the right time.
It's not even a quarter to the right time.

02:18:45.117 --> 02:18:46.785
June.

02:18:48.412 --> 02:18:49.745
How do you know when...?

02:18:49.913 --> 02:18:53.165
You haven't been clean
even six months.

02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:57.754
Except for a honeymoon, you have not
thought about what you're asking me.

02:18:57.921 --> 02:19:00.007
Yes, I have.

02:19:00.174 --> 02:19:02.550
I have. It's all I've thought about.

02:19:02.759 --> 02:19:04.761
Well, how's it gonna work, John?

02:19:04.928 --> 02:19:06.972
Where we gonna live?

02:19:07.138 --> 02:19:09.391
What about my girls?

02:19:09.558 --> 02:19:12.519
What about your girls?
What about your parents, John?

02:19:12.686 --> 02:19:15.147
Your daddy won't even look at me.

02:19:15.314 --> 02:19:17.441
June, that stuff will
just work itself out.

02:19:17.648 --> 02:19:19.151
No, it doesn't work itself out.

02:19:19.317 --> 02:19:22.279
People work it out for you,
and you think it works itself out.

02:19:24.364 --> 02:19:26.700
- You're scared.
- What?

02:19:27.284 --> 02:19:29.745
Scared of being in love.

02:19:30.913 --> 02:19:33.999
Scared of losing control.
And you know what, June Carter?

02:19:34.165 --> 02:19:37.544
I think you're scared of living
in my big fat shadow.

02:19:37.753 --> 02:19:39.504
- That's your problem.
- Oh, really?

02:19:39.671 --> 02:19:41.215
- Is that my problem?
- Yeah, it is.

02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:43.258
My problem is it's 2 a.m.

02:19:43.424 --> 02:19:45.093
My problem is I'm asleep.

02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:47.262
I'm on a tour bus with
eight stinking men.

02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:49.932
Rule number one:
Don't propose to a girl on a bus.

02:19:50.098 --> 02:19:51.725
You got that? Rule number two:

02:19:51.892 --> 02:19:54.770
Don't tell her it's because
you had a bad dream.

02:19:56.146 --> 02:19:58.524
- June?
- What?

02:19:59.107 --> 02:20:00.901
Marry me.

02:20:06.281 --> 02:20:07.908
Okay.

02:20:09.576 --> 02:20:13.205
Well, that's... That's the last time
I'm asking.

02:20:13.413 --> 02:20:16.542
Well, good. I hate reruns.

02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:28.011
I got your extra bag.
You don't have to bother...

02:20:30.931 --> 02:20:32.266
Hey, June?

02:20:35.227 --> 02:20:36.854
June.

02:20:38.063 --> 02:20:39.690
June?

02:20:46.363 --> 02:20:48.115
What, you're not talking to me?

02:20:48.323 --> 02:20:50.951
You are not allowed to speak to me.
After that stunt...

02:20:51.118 --> 02:20:53.495
...you're only allowed to
speak to me on-stage.

02:20:53.662 --> 02:20:56.331
- Do you understand?
- What'd I do?

02:20:56.498 --> 02:20:58.333
Why don't you ask
your big fat shadow?

02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:00.169
- Come on, baby.
- "Come on, baby."

02:21:00.335 --> 02:21:03.672
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

02:21:05.424 --> 02:21:09.011
<i>The taste of love is sweet</i>

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:13.849
<i>When hearts like ours meet</i>

02:21:15.475 --> 02:21:18.020
<i>I fell for you like a child</i>

02:21:19.646 --> 02:21:23.150
<i>Oh, but the fire went wild</i>

02:21:24.526 --> 02:21:28.780
<i>I fell into a burning ring offire</i>

02:21:28.947 --> 02:21:33.869
<i>I went down, down, down</i>
<i>And the flames went higher</i>

02:21:34.036 --> 02:21:39.208
<i>And it burns, burns, burns</i>
<i>The ring of fire</i>

02:21:39.416 --> 02:21:44.171
<i>The ring of fire</i>
<i>The ring of fire</i>

02:21:44.338 --> 02:21:48.717
<i>The ring of fire</i>
<i>The ring of fire</i>

02:21:57.184 --> 02:21:59.394
All right. Thank you.

02:22:01.855 --> 02:22:04.733
I don't know if y'all know
who wrote that song...

02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:09.071
...but it's this long-legged gal standing
right here, Miss June Carter.

02:22:10.155 --> 02:22:12.491
Thanks, y'all. Thank you very much.

02:22:12.699 --> 02:22:15.410
So, June, you gonna
stand over there all night...

02:22:15.577 --> 02:22:17.996
...or you wanna come over
here and sing with me?

02:22:18.705 --> 02:22:21.083
I'll sing with you.
You sure that's what you want?

02:22:21.250 --> 02:22:23.961
- Yeah.
- All right. Hold on.

02:22:29.091 --> 02:22:32.010
- Well, folks, what do you say?
All right, Johnny.

02:22:32.177 --> 02:22:35.097
You wanna hear "Jackson"?

02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:42.563
I thought you was gonna wax
poetic a little bit longer.

02:22:42.729 --> 02:22:45.941
- Oh, no, I'm done with that, June.
- Okay, good.

02:22:54.324 --> 02:22:57.744
<i>- We got married in a fever</i>
<i>- We got married in a fever</i>

02:22:57.911 --> 02:23:01.456
<i>- Hotter than a pepper sprout</i>
<i>- Hotter than a pepper sprout</i>

02:23:01.665 --> 02:23:05.085
<i>- We've been talking about Jackson</i>
<i>- We've been talking about Jackson</i>

02:23:05.294 --> 02:23:08.213
<i>Ever since the fire went out</i>

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:10.883
<i>I'm going to Jackson</i>

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:14.511
<i>I'm gonna mess around</i>

02:23:14.678 --> 02:23:18.223
<i>Yeah, I'm going to Jackson</i>

02:23:18.390 --> 02:23:21.393
<i>Look out, Jackson town</i>

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:25.189
<i>Well, go on down to Jackson</i>

02:23:25.355 --> 02:23:28.609
<i>Go ahead and wreck your health</i>

02:23:28.775 --> 02:23:31.904
<i>Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man</i>

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:35.532
<i>Make a big fool of yourself</i>

02:23:35.741 --> 02:23:38.577
<i>You're going to Jackson</i>

02:23:38.744 --> 02:23:40.871
<i>Go comb your hair</i>

02:23:45.584 --> 02:23:48.003
<i>See if I care</i>

02:23:56.053 --> 02:23:59.223
Sorry for the interruption, folks...

02:23:59.389 --> 02:24:03.644
...but I gotta ask June here a question
before we finish this song.

02:24:04.228 --> 02:24:06.104
What's that, John?

02:24:08.649 --> 02:24:10.859
Will you marry me?

02:24:13.987 --> 02:24:15.906
Why don't we just sing
the song, John.

02:24:16.281 --> 02:24:17.950
No, darling.

02:24:20.369 --> 02:24:23.997
Come on, finish the song.
People wanna hear us sing.

02:24:26.291 --> 02:24:27.960
Sorry, folks...

02:24:28.168 --> 02:24:32.506
...but I just can't do this song anymore
unless she's gonna marry me.

02:24:32.673 --> 02:24:35.175
It'd just be like we're lying.

02:24:35.843 --> 02:24:37.553
You got these people
all revved up, John.

02:24:37.761 --> 02:24:40.931
- Now, come on, let's sing "Jackson."
- You got me all revved up.

02:24:41.098 --> 02:24:45.769
I've asked you 40 different ways, it's
time you come up with a fresh answer.

02:24:47.271 --> 02:24:49.064
Please sing.

02:24:49.523 --> 02:24:53.610
I'm asking you to marry me.

02:24:53.777 --> 02:24:55.946
I love you, June.

02:24:58.282 --> 02:25:00.701
Now, I know I've said and
done a lot of things...

02:25:00.868 --> 02:25:06.164
...that I hurt you. But I promise
I'll never do that again.

02:25:06.331 --> 02:25:08.458
I only wanna take care of you.

02:25:08.625 --> 02:25:13.172
I will not leave you like that Dutch
boy with your finger in the dam.

02:25:17.176 --> 02:25:19.511
You're my best friend.

02:25:20.596 --> 02:25:22.681
Marry me.

02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:31.648
All right.

02:25:32.316 --> 02:25:34.151
Yeah?

02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:57.799
In case none of y'all heard,
she said yes.

02:26:04.806 --> 02:26:07.518
She finally said yes.

02:26:40.759 --> 02:26:43.804
Grandpa, here. Let's talk on this.

02:26:43.971 --> 02:26:47.641
- What do you want me to do with it?
- Well, you listen and you talk.

02:26:47.850 --> 02:26:51.478
It's a tin-can telephone,
and the sound goes up the string.

02:26:53.021 --> 02:26:55.440
Hello, grand girls.

02:26:55.607 --> 02:26:57.276
Hello, grand girls.

02:26:57.442 --> 02:27:00.821
Can you hear us?
- Hello, Roseanne.

02:27:00.988 --> 02:27:03.323
- Hello, Carlene.
- You gotta pull it tight, Daddy.

02:27:03.490 --> 02:27:05.617
Grandpa, speak.
Talk, Grandpa.

02:27:05.784 --> 02:27:07.911
- Tell us a story.
Speak. Grandpa.

02:27:08.078 --> 02:27:11.081
- Take it and talk to them.
- They wanna talk to their grandpa.

02:27:11.248 --> 02:27:14.543
Well, I don't got no stories.
You got all the stories. You...

02:27:16.712 --> 02:27:18.630
Why don't you tell
them about the flood?

02:27:18.922 --> 02:27:22.759
About how you made a boat out of the
front door and got us all out of there.

02:27:22.968 --> 02:27:24.928
They'll like that.

02:27:25.095 --> 02:27:28.932
Tell us.
- Go on, tell them. Pull the string tight.

02:27:29.683 --> 02:27:34.855
It was 1937. There was a flood.

02:27:35.305 --> 02:27:41.160
