I don't know where.
Please, help. I'm scared.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.525
- You’re in a coffin?
- Yes.

11:31.609 --> 11:32.860
It's like one of those old,
wooden ones.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.029
- Are you at a funeral home?
- No. No. No.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.155

How are you calling me right now?

11:37.490 --> 11:38.491

If you’re buried in a coffin,
where are you calling me from?

11:41.952 --> 11:43.746
From a cell phone.
There was an old cell phone in the coffin.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.332

- Yes.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.250
Yes. Yes. No, no.
It's not my cell phone,

11:48.334 --> 11:49.627
but, yes, I'm calling from a cell phone.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.380
There was a cell phone in the coffin
when you climbed in?

11:52.463 --> 11:53.964
Yes. What?

11:54.882 --> 11:57.551
- I didn’t climb in, though.
- How did you end up in the coffin, sir?

11:57.635 --> 11:59.345

They gave me a safety number and it was in
my wallet, and I don't know where it is now.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.476

I can patch you through

I'm buried in the desert somewhere.
I need you to help me.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.020
Whoa. Whoa. Sin slow down.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.813

16:30.032 --> 16:32.117
Okay Paul, explain to me what's going on.

16:32.201 --> 16:34.328
All right, all right. Okay.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.123
All right, me and a convoy of other drivers

16:38.207 --> 16:41.085
were delivering some kitchen supplies
to a community center.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.963
And then some kids,
they started throwing rocks at the trucks.

16:45.047 --> 16:50.135
And then, an IED went off up ahead
and it blew up one of the other trucks.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.389
And then these guys,
they came out from behind the houses

16:53.472 --> 16:56.266
and they started shooting everyone
right there on the street.

16:56.350 --> 16:58.852
- Were you shot at?
- I don't know.

16:58.936 --> 17:01.480
I don't know.
I was way in the back of the convoy.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.774
I guess I got hit in the head
by one of the other...

17:03.857 --> 17:07.444
By one of the rocks and I blacked out,
and that's the last thing that I remember.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.906
And then I woke up here,
tied up, in a coffin.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.534
- Who put you there?
- I guess whoever ambushed us.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.536
- A bunch of kids?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

17:15.618 --> 17:18.372
Some kids, the kids,
they threw the rocks at us.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.209
These guys, some Iraqis, some insurgents.
I don't fucking know.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.627
They just... They popped out
and they started shooting everybody...

17:24.712 --> 17:27.172
- right there on the street.
- I thought you said they didn't shoot at you.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.507
They didn't! I don't know.
They shot them!

17:28.590 --> 17:30.217
Sin you're gonna have to stop shouting.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.511
I'm shouting
because you're not listening to me!

17:32.594 --> 17:34.471
I need you to help me!

17:35.556 --> 17:38.517
Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.

17:39.435 --> 17:43.230
Can you trace the call?
GPS or something?

17:44.231 --> 17:46.817
Why is it that they didn't shoot you?

17:48.402 --> 17:51.989
I don't know. I have no idea.
They didn't. That's all I know.

17:53.073 --> 17:56.201
What’s your social security number, Paul?

17:56.285 --> 17:58.245
Why?

17:58.328 --> 18:00.873
Why? Who cares?

18:00.956 --> 18:02.666
I'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert,

18:02.750 --> 18:04.543
who cares
what my social security number is?

18:04.626 --> 18:07.755
I'm an American citizen.
Just send someone to find me.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.342

I can't hear you.

18:12.426 --> 18:15.554
What did you...
Hold on, hold on. No, no, no. I can't...

Who took it, sir?

19:10.400 --> 19:13.320

27:14.092 --> 27:17.512

27:17.595 --> 27:21.057

27:21.141 --> 27:22.726

27:53.465 --> 27:55.675
- Hey. How's it going?
- Okay.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.845
I need to talk to Linda.
She's not answering her phone.

27:58.928 --> 27:59.888
I've got a problem.

27:59.971 --> 28:01.389
I've been held hostage
by a group of guys that...

28:01.473 --> 28:03.892
Fooled you. I'm not really home.

28:03.975 --> 28:07.520
But if you leave a message, i'll get back
to you as soon as I get in. Bye-bye.

28:08.730 --> 28:11.775
Donna, I need to talk to Linda.
It's an absolute emergency.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.152
Have her call me. Use star 69
to find out the number of this phone

28:14.235 --> 28:15.987
and have her call me at this number, okay?

28:16.071 --> 28:17.864
- Paul?
- Donna.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.617
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?

28:20.700 --> 28:22.660
I don't know. I haven 't talked to her all day.
Call her cell. ..

28:22.744 --> 28:24.788
- Are you at your computer right now?
- Yeah. Why?

28:24.871 --> 28:28.291
Okay, I need you to look up a number for me
to the State Department.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.710
Paul, I was just heading out
to the supermarket. I really...

28:30.794 --> 28:32.587
Please, please, please.
Just look up the number for me.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.422
- Ls everything all right?
- No! Everything is not all right!

28:34.506 --> 28:36.549
- Just look up the number for me.
- Don 't fucking yell at me...

28:36.633 --> 28:38.259
- I'm not yelling at you, Donna.
- Yes, you are.

28:38.343 --> 28:40.762
No, I'm not.
Just get me the fucking number!

28:40.845 --> 28:43.390
Get me the number!
Get me the fucking number!

28:44.557 --> 28:45.850
FUCK!

28:45.934 --> 28:48.520
You stupid fucking cunt!

28:48.978 --> 28:50.063
FUCK!

28:50.563 --> 28:53.024
Fuck you, bitch! Fuck you!

28:53.650 --> 28:54.943
Fuck you!

29:17.507 --> 29:20.802
- What?
- Donna, I'm very sorry that I yelled at you.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.346
I shouldn't have done that.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.557
But I'm only going to ask you one more time
to get me this number,

29:25.640 --> 29:28.143
and if you don't, I'm gonna die.

29:28.226 --> 29:30.311
- What?
- Please, I don't have time to explain.

29:30.395 --> 29:32.981
- The number.
- Okay, hold on.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.696
- Okay. State Department.
- Yeah.

29:39.779 --> 29:42.532
- It’s 202...
- 202.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.659
- 134...
- 134.

29:44.742 --> 29:47.745
- 4750.
- 4750?

29:47.829 --> 29:49.622
- Yeah.
- Okay. Fuck you.

29:59.716 --> 30:00.717
United States Department of State.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.470
I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq.
I've been taken hostage.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.972
- I need to speak to someone right away.
- Where are you calling from, sir?

30:06.055 --> 30:10.059
From Iraq. I'm a truck driver.
I work for CRT.
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.604
My convoy was attacked
and I'm being held for ransom.

30:12.687 --> 30:15.482
- Are the kidnappers with you?
- No. I'm buried somewhere.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.609
- You're buried?
- Yeah. Yeah, in a coffin.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.486
It's a wooden box, an old wooden coffin.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.362
Did you try contacting the military out there?

30:21.446 --> 30:23.865
They gave me a number to call,
a safety number.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.992
- But the people took it.
- The people holding you hostage?

30:26.075 --> 30:28.161
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't know.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.830
- Hold on. Let me connect you...
- No, don't put me on hold! No!

30:40.924 --> 30:42.217
- Rebecca Browning.
- Hello?

30:42.300 --> 30:44.552
Yes, hello.
I was just informed of your situation.

30:44.636 --> 30:45.845
Yeah, my situation.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.764
I'm running out of time
and you guys keep putting me on hold.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.516
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

30:49.599 --> 30:50.683
Don't be sorry. Just help me.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.477
I just have a few questions for you,
Mn Conroy.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.104
- You've got to be kidding me.
- It's important that I get this information.

30:55.188 --> 30:58.483
- It’ll help make a rescue attempt...
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.652
- How do you know my name?
- I'm sorry?

31:00.735 --> 31:05.448
My name, I didn't give it to you.
I didn't give it to the other guy either.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.534
What's going on right now?

31:08.076 --> 31:11.621
We received a call from a representative
at CRT. You left him a message?

31:11.704 --> 31:13.206
- Yeah?
- He contacted us right away.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.415
So if you know what the hell is going on,

31:14.499 --> 31:15.667
then what have you done
to get me out of here?

31:15.750 --> 31:17.752
Well, there 's little we can do
from Washington.

31:17.835 --> 31:20.421
So that's it?
I'm just supposed to sit here and rot

31:20.505 --> 31:21.589
because there's little you can do?

31:21.673 --> 31:22.674
- No.
- Then what?

31:22.757 --> 31:25.051
I need to know where you were
when your convoy was ambushed.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.345
- In Baqubah, in the Diyala province.
- Okay.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.055
And has contact been made
with the kidnappers?

31:29.138 --> 31:31.724
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million
by 9:00 tonight.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.726
Okay or else...

31:33.810 --> 31:36.271
Or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.

31:36.354 --> 31:39.983
- What the hell do you think, lady?
- We'll do everything we can.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.318
So you'll pay them then? Yeah?

31:42.402 --> 31:44.445
- No. That we can't do.
- Wait, wait. Why?

31:44.529 --> 31:46.030
It’s the policy
of the United States government

31:46.114 --> 31:47.365
to not negotiate with terrorists.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.825
Not the policy of the
United States government?

31:48.908 --> 31:50.243
Lady, come on!

31:50.326 --> 31:52.787
You're sitting in an air conditioned office,
this is easy for you to say.

31:52.870 --> 31:56.124
You're not the one stuck in a coffin,
buried in the goddamn desert!

31:56.207 --> 31:58.876
- I understand your frustration...
- Frustration?

31:58.960 --> 32:02.463
Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here.
Understand that?

32:09.721 --> 32:11.264
- Hello?
- I'm here.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.933
Then say something.
Tell me how you can get me out of here.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.018
Okay.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.562
What's the number on the phone
that you're calling from?

32:17.645 --> 32:20.648
- I don't Know. Did it come up on your end?
- No. It's listed as unavailable.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.859
Tell me this, can you remember a number?

32:22.942 --> 32:24.777
Yeah. No. I have a... I have a pencil.

32:24.861 --> 32:27.697
- Okay write this down.
- Okay, just a sec.

32:28.823 --> 32:30.617
Okay. Go ahead.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.201
- 410...
- Yeah.

32:32.285 --> 32:33.536
...195...

32:34.245 --> 32:36.581
- 5453.
- 5453.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.708
- Who's that?
- That's Dan Brenner

32:38.791 --> 32:42.545
He's the commander of the hostage
working group over in Iraq.

32:43.713 --> 32:44.964
Hostage working group?

32:45.048 --> 32:48.635
Formed it in 2004
to deal with situations such as yours.

32:48.718 --> 32:51.929
Situations.
I love how you keep calling it that.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.473
- Did you write down the number?
- Yeah.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.850
Good. Now, just hold on,
I 'll connect you with him now.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.436
- He should be expecting you.
- What about the news? I wanna call them.

32:58.519 --> 32:59.812
No, don't call the news.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.356
- I repeat, do not contact the news.
- Why?

33:01.439 --> 33:03.232
- It will only complicate things further..
- That's bullshit.

33:03.316 --> 33:04.984
- You're just covering your own ass.
- No, I'm covering yours.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.736
You don't go looking for something
you don't know is missing.

33:06.819 --> 33:07.820
Everyone who needs to know
about this does.

33:07.904 --> 33:10.448
- I need all the help I can get.
- We are running out of time, Paul.

33:10.531 --> 33:13.951
That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner
right away.

33:14.661 --> 33:15.745
Fine.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.623
I'm transferring you now.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.729
- Brenner
- Dan Brenner?

33:41.813 --> 33:44.357
- Ls this Paul Conroy?
- Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.275
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.

33:46.359 --> 33:49.612
I want you to know that we're already
working on trying to get you out of there.

33:49.696 --> 33:50.863
Thank you, God.

33:50.947 --> 33:53.825
I was told that we have until 9:00 p.m.
ls that right?

33:53.908 --> 33:55.034
- That's what he said.
- All right.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.120
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.

33:57.203 --> 34:00.081
And just so I have this right,
the kidnappers buried you in the ground?

34:00.164 --> 34:01.290
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.

34:01.374 --> 34:04.460
Okay my guess is that
since you're able to get a cell signal,

34:04.544 --> 34:07.171
- you're no more than a few feet underground.
- Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

34:07.255 --> 34:10.299
What about battery life?
How much does the phone have left?

34:10.382 --> 34:14.971
- It's just less than half.
- Okay you have to conserve that battery.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.889
Our best bet of finding you
by tracking your cell signal.

34:17.974 --> 34:21.185
- Ls the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
- Vibrate.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.438
I need you to press
and hold down the asterisk key

34:23.521 --> 34:26.107
to change it to a ring tone.
It will use less power

34:26.190 --> 34:28.775
- What about my Zippo?
- You have a lighter?

34:28.860 --> 34:31.404
- Yeah.
- Use it to look around for markings,

34:31.487 --> 34:33.072
logo, whatever you can find.
- Won’t it use up oxygen?

34:33.156 --> 34:34.741
Don 't worry about that now.
Just try to find...

34:34.824 --> 34:37.118
- It's just so dark in here without it.
- I understand, Paul.

34:37.201 --> 34:41.289
Try to find anything in there that
might indicate where that coffin was made.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.751
- You guys have to hurry.
- We're working as fast as we can, Paul.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.543
Do you Know
if there were any other survivors?

34:46.627 --> 34:48.463
- From your convoy?
- Yeah.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.672
Still unclear at this point.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.592
I just wanted to do right by my family.
That's all.

34:53.676 --> 34:56.971
I didn't know
it was going to be like this out here.

34:57.430 --> 34:59.557
I don't think any of us did.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.604
- That's him. He's calling.
- The kidnapper?

35:04.687 --> 35:06.397
- Yeah. What should I do?
- You know his number?

35:06.481 --> 35:07.523
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

35:07.607 --> 35:09.108
- Okay. What about the call?
- Give me the number first.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.318
- He's going to hang up.
- Take the call.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.029
- I... Okay.
- That's okay, just take the call.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.198
Hello! Hello.

35:16.032 --> 35:17.867
Two hour; four minute.

35:20.244 --> 35:23.539
- You have to give me more time.
- You talk to embassy?

35:23.623 --> 35:25.541
- Give the money?
- Yeah, yeah. I talked to someone.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.335
The government.
They said that they won't pay the money.

35:27.418 --> 35:28.544
- No pay?
- No.

35:28.628 --> 35:30.588
They said they don't negotiate with terrorists.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.049
Terrorists? I am terrorist?

35:33.132 --> 35:36.719
Yeah.
Yeah. You're a terrorist, you son of a bitch.

35:36.803 --> 35:39.222
You terrified, so I am terrorist?

35:40.056 --> 35:42.058
What did I ever do to you?

35:42.433 --> 35:43.976
- Ever do?
- Yeah.

35:45.061 --> 35:49.398
Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,
to make money.

35:49.482 --> 35:52.151
- That's it.
- I have job until you come.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.654
- Now my family have nothing.
- That's not my fault!

35:54.737 --> 35:59.158
9/11 was not my fault, but you still here.
Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.

35:59.242 --> 36:02.078
I told you, I'm only here to work.
To help rebuild.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.454
Rebuild what you destroyed.

36:03.538 --> 36:08.000
Stop! Stop! Just please, stop!
I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay?

36:08.084 --> 36:09.627
I'm nobody that makes decisions
about anything.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.587
I just want to go home.

36:16.843 --> 36:18.010
Hello?

36:19.387 --> 36:22.306
- You make video. Ransom video.
- Yeah, yeah!

36:22.390 --> 36:23.933
I'll make a video.
If you let me go, I'll make a video.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.018
No. You make video now.

36:26.102 --> 36:28.437
- What? How?
- Use video on phone.

36:29.313 --> 36:32.567
Near foot. You read note near foot in box.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.863
- I don't see it.
- Near foot.

36:36.946 --> 36:39.365
- Read note inside box.
- Okay, okay.

36:39.448 --> 36:43.369
- If I make the video, you let me go?
- Only if we get money.

36:43.452 --> 36:46.038
Nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.

36:46.122 --> 36:49.000
We take less. One million, money.

36:49.083 --> 36:51.294
If they pay, you'll let me go?

36:52.587 --> 36:55.172
One million, money.

39:41.338 --> 39:42.465
OW!

41:03.921 --> 41:07.049
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.

41:07.133 --> 41:09.552
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!

41:12.221 --> 41:15.182
We’re sorry, your call
cannot be completed. Please, dial again.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.392
Shit.

41:28.821 --> 41:30.156
- Paul?
- Here's his number.

41:30.239 --> 41:33.409
- Hold on. All right, go ahead.
- Okay. Hold on.

41:34.785 --> 41:39.582
It's 07-902-24-921.

41:40.291 --> 41:43.669
Okay. This is huge, Paul.
Unless they're using a cloned line,

41:43.752 --> 41:46.505
we should be able to find
where this is coming from in minutes.

41:46.589 --> 41:48.424
Okay. What about me?
Can you track my cell signal?

41:48.507 --> 41:50.176
We 're having a lot of trouble with yours.

41:50.259 --> 41:51.844
Seems to be an EDS line,

41:51.927 --> 41:53.804
probably through
one of the Egyptian carriers.

41:53.888 --> 41:55.639
What does that mean?

41:56.682 --> 42:00.186
- That it's just not going to be easy.
- He wants me to make a ransom video.

42:00.269 --> 42:02.938
No. Hold off for as long as you can.

42:03.022 --> 42:04.523
If it gets me out of here, I'm making it.

42:04.607 --> 42:07.818
The last thing we want
is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera.

42:07.902 --> 42:08.903
- We'?
- Yes.

42:08.986 --> 42:10.738
This can't turn into an international incident.

42:10.821 --> 42:13.324
That's all you people care about, isn't it?
Don't you care about me?

42:13.407 --> 42:14.450
- We do.
- What about me?

42:14.533 --> 42:16.785
We do, Paul, we do. That's why we're here.

42:16.869 --> 42:19.455
No, no, no, you don't!
You don't care about me.

42:19.538 --> 42:20.623
You don't care about any of us.

42:20.706 --> 42:23.000
I've had eight friends killed out here,
six of them today.

42:23.083 --> 42:26.545
- Listen, Paul. You just...
- We don't have any guns, any armor.

42:26.629 --> 42:28.797
- Nothing.
- That's because you're not soldiers.

42:28.881 --> 42:30.549
Tell that to the people
who put me in this box!

42:30.633 --> 42:33.844
- Paul, listen.
- Tell that to the people who shot my friends!

42:33.928 --> 42:36.889
- We're doing the best we can.
- No, you're not! You're not!

42:36.972 --> 42:38.432
- Okay, calm down.
- I've been out here nine months.

42:38.515 --> 42:40.100
I know how it works. All you guys care about

42:40.184 --> 42:41.894
is your secret plans
and your back-room politics.

42:41.977 --> 42:43.270
You know, if I was a diplomat,

42:43.354 --> 42:46.106
or a hostage working group leader,
or what the fuck your title is,

42:46.190 --> 42:47.233
I'd be out of here by now.

42:47.316 --> 42:50.069
But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to
sit in here, shut my mouth and die.

42:50.152 --> 42:52.905
Okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.

42:52.988 --> 42:53.989
Fuck you, Dan.

42:54.073 --> 42:56.909
Paul, listen to me.
Finding you is our primary concern.

42:56.992 --> 42:58.911
Bottom line. And we 're searching for you

42:58.994 --> 43:01.247
just as hard as we would be
for a four-star general,

43:01.330 --> 43:03.415
so don't literally waste your breath
suggesting otherwise.

43:03.499 --> 43:06.252
I can't... I can't...

43:06.335 --> 43:07.753
Are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?

43:07.836 --> 43:09.922
I don't know. Who are they?

43:10.005 --> 43:11.674
The people who put me in here,
who are they?

43:11.757 --> 43:15.177
They're just that, people.
No different from you and me.

43:15.261 --> 43:17.930
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Neither are they.

43:18.013 --> 43:19.014
How do you know?

43:19.723 --> 43:23.185
If you were homeless, starving...
Actually I take that back.

43:23.269 --> 43:26.480
If your family was homeless and starving,
what would you do for them?

43:26.563 --> 43:29.566
- I wouldn't kill somebody.
- How can you be sure?

43:30.943 --> 43:32.695
What difference does it make?

43:32.778 --> 43:35.447
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.

43:35.531 --> 43:38.033
They don't care about anything
other than getting the money.

43:38.117 --> 43:39.994
So pay them, just pay them.

43:40.077 --> 43:43.539
Trust me, if it was an option,
I would do that in a heartbeat.

43:46.750 --> 43:48.961
How many others have there been?

43:49.044 --> 43:50.462
- Since I got here?
- Yeah.

43:50.546 --> 43:53.507
Dozens. Journalists, contractors, soldiers.

43:53.590 --> 43:58.053
Dozens have been taken. It's one of
the only functioning businesses out here.

43:58.137 --> 44:00.139
How many have you rescued?

44:05.060 --> 44:07.688
- How many?
- Not many.

44:07.771 --> 44:09.857
- Tell me their names.
- No.

44:11.108 --> 44:13.986
- Any of them.
- Who?

44:14.069 --> 44:16.905
Make me believe
that they really do matter to you.

44:16.989 --> 44:18.907
That they really do matter to you.

44:19.533 --> 44:22.286
- Mark White.
- Who was Mark White?

44:23.412 --> 44:27.750
A kid from New Hampshire.
Twenty-six years old. Med student.

44:28.375 --> 44:31.253
Came over here to help out local doctors.

44:31.337 --> 44:33.130
What happened to him?

44:33.714 --> 44:36.633
- Insurgents grabbed him.
- When?

44:36.717 --> 44:38.385
About three weeks ago.

44:42.473 --> 44:45.351
You remember his name?

44:45.434 --> 44:47.519
I remember all their names.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.940
Is he... Did he?

44:52.024 --> 44:54.610
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive.

44:54.985 --> 44:56.904
- Where is he now?
- Home.

44:57.988 --> 45:00.491
Probably happy to be back at school.

45:03.452 --> 45:05.496
I want to get out of here.

45:05.579 --> 45:07.915
We found him. We’ll find you, too.

45:09.958 --> 45:11.001
How?

45:11.377 --> 45:14.546
We already have a solid lead
on the number you gave us.

45:14.630 --> 45:17.591
- You do?
- Yeah. A unit's on its way over there now.

45:18.592 --> 45:19.968
That's good.

45:20.594 --> 45:22.471
- That feels good.
- Yeah.

45:24.473 --> 45:27.309
What... What should I do in the meantime?

45:27.726 --> 45:30.229
I know it's hard, but try to relax.

45:30.312 --> 45:33.524
The more worked up you are,
the more air you're going to use.

45:33.607 --> 45:35.734
Okay, I know.

45:35.818 --> 45:40.864
I know. It's hard, 'cause I have anxiety.

45:41.782 --> 45:43.659
I take pills for it.

45:43.992 --> 45:46.078
- Do you have them with you?
- Yeah.

45:46.161 --> 45:47.162
Good. Take them.

45:47.788 --> 45:50.249
You need to preserve your oxygen level
any way you can.

45:50.332 --> 45:51.458
Okay.

45:52.626 --> 45:55.254
- Ls your Zippo still lit?
- No, not anymore.

45:55.337 --> 45:57.756
- All right. Good.
- I feel nauseous.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.591
- You have to calm down.
- Okay.

45:59.675 --> 46:01.844
And you need to save that battery.

46:02.511 --> 46:05.013
We 're expecting some intel
in about 10 minutes.

46:05.097 --> 46:06.974
- Call me back then.
- Okay.

46:07.057 --> 46:10.102
- Just hang in there, Paul.
- I'm trying, okay.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.695
- What?
- You make video?

46:19.778 --> 46:20.946
- No.
- You make video!

46:21.029 --> 46:22.156
- Let me out and I'll make it.
- No!

46:22.239 --> 46:23.949
- You make video now.
- I can't read the paper.

46:24.032 --> 46:25.451
- Make video now!
- I can't.

46:25.534 --> 46:27.327
I don't know what you want me to say.
I can't read the paper.

46:27.411 --> 46:29.121
You make video! Now!

46:30.539 --> 46:31.623
I Fuck!

46:38.213 --> 46:39.590
I

46:58.400 --> 47:00.360
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on, come on.

47:01.278 --> 47:02.404
Come on!

47:02.488 --> 47:05.782
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

47:38.482 --> 47:39.608
Fuck.

48:12.015 --> 48:13.141
Shit.

49:56.078 --> 49:58.080
Mountain View Nursing Home.

49:58.163 --> 50:02.626
Hi. I was hoping that
I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please.

50:03.919 --> 50:05.087
Okay.

50:05.587 --> 50:09.966
Let me bring the cordless phone to her room.
Hold on one moment, please.

50:17.766 --> 50:20.477
Mrs. Conroy, you have e telephone cell, dean

50:21.269 --> 50:22.938

50:39.955 --> 50:41.832

Who are you?

50:45.127 --> 50:47.504

50:48.755 --> 50:50.465

51:17.617 --> 51:18.702
Yeah.

51:19.828 --> 51:21.830
I don’t think Pop’s there with you, Mom.

51:22.914 --> 51:25.000
How are you doing, sweetie?

51:25.959 --> 51:27.461
Not very good.

51:31.006 --> 51:33.967
This might be the last time that I talk to you.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.802
That's nice, honey.

51:38.305 --> 51:41.516
Did you get the flowers I sent you
a few months ago?

51:41.933 --> 51:46.730
- Flowers?
- Yeah, I sent you... Never mind.

51:48.774 --> 51:51.568
Look, I'm gonna get going now, okay?

51:52.110 --> 51:54.905
I just wanted to call and talk to you.

51:55.614 --> 51:57.199
I love you, Mom.

51:59.409 --> 52:01.745
I said, I love you, Mom.
Do you want to tell me that you love me?

52:01.828 --> 52:06.249

53:34.713 --> 53:37.132
You have three minute to send video.

54:01.156 --> 54:02.407
My name is Paul Conroy.

54:02.490 --> 54:04.951
I'm an American citizen
from Hastings, Michigan.

54:05.035 --> 54:08.997
I'm a civilian truck driver
for Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

54:09.080 --> 54:11.791
And I have been taken hostage
somewhere in Iraq.

54:12.709 --> 54:15.837
I need $1 million by 9:00 tonight,
Baghdad time,

54:16.546 --> 54:19.341
or I'll be left to die here in this coffin
that I'm buried in.

54:20.258 --> 54:22.802
I'm told that if the money is paid...

54:24.763 --> 54:27.349
I'm told that if the money is paid,
I will be let go.

54:27.432 --> 54:29.851
If it is not, I will be left to die here.

54:31.770 --> 54:35.231
These threats are real
and will be followed through on.

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:56.464
Oh, my God.

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:03.805
I got you.

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:14.941
I got you, you motherfucker.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.866
I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:28.079
Fucking A. Okay.

01:02:34.085 --> 01:02:36.712

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.923
Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.

Thanks and have a great day.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.554
Linda, I figured out the number of the phone.
I got it.

01:02:44.679 --> 01:02:46.597
I got it!

01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:51.394
Okay. It's 0792-42-884.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:55.148
Use the international calling code to dial it.
I got it, baby.

01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:59.026
I love you. Call me as soon as you get this.
Call me. I love you.

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:04.407
Oh, shit.

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:07.702
Shit.

01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.037
Okay.

01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:53.831
Fuck. Come on.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.304
Fuck.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:41.420
My name is Pamela Lutti.

01:04:41.504 --> 01:04:44.131
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda,

01:04:44.632 --> 01:04:47.718
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:54.850
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:56.936
Please. Please, don’t!

01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:16.831
My name is Pamela Lutti.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.833
Please, don’t!

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:24.589
If you’re buried in a coffin,
where are you calling from?

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:29.927
The number you requested,

01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:36.392
269-948-1998.

01:05:37.602 --> 01:05:40.271
They're criminals,
desperate ones at that.

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:42.273
They don't care about anything
other than getting...

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:44.650
At CRT,
we work with our clients to provide...

01:05:44.734 --> 01:05:46.944
Sin you're gonna
have to stop shouting.

01:05:47.028 --> 01:05:49.363
I

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:54.827
Five million, money
tonight, 9:00 p.m., or you stay.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.997
Finding you is our primary concern.
Bottom line.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.416
I

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.881
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:09.675
Please, leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!

01:06:47.963 --> 01:06:49.924
Why the hell did you make that video?

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:52.635
- It's all a bunch of lies.
- What is?

01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:53.969
What are you talking about?

01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:56.097
- All Of it.
- All Of What?

01:06:56.597 --> 01:06:59.767
You don't give a shit about any of us.
We're nothing to you people.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.644
We’re going to find you.I

01:07:01.727 --> 01:07:04.021
Fuck off, Dan. You're babysitting.

01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:06.649
Just gonna stay on the phone with me
until I die.

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:09.026
Okay.
You can’t start breaking on me now, Paul.

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:13.030
- You have to stay strong.
- They shot her and you didn't do anything.

01:07:13.114 --> 01:07:15.408
We didn't even know
she'd been taken hostage.

01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:18.703
- She sent three videos.
- Yeah. That's what they told her to say.

01:07:18.786 --> 01:07:20.621
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:22.957
What do you know?

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:28.629
That your ransom video
already has 47,000 hits on YouTube.

01:07:29.588 --> 01:07:33.259
And all the major networks are playing it,
including Al Jazeera.

01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:36.804
So now your captors have no choice
but to follow through.

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:39.306
I found out the number to this phone.

01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:42.351
- How?
- Who cares?

01:07:43.352 --> 01:07:45.688
I figured it out and you didn’t. Why?

01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:50.025
Because I didn't.

01:07:50.443 --> 01:07:52.570
Just like you and every other person
on the planet,

01:07:52.653 --> 01:07:55.823
there are some things I know,
and there are some things I don't.

01:07:57.825 --> 01:07:59.869
Then how am I ever gonna get out of here?

01:07:59.952 --> 01:08:04.165
Their signal was cloned, like we figured.
But we're close. Really close.

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:08.335
I'm near a mosque.

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:11.255
I heard a call to prayer over the PA.

01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:14.550
Good. Good.
That means that we're in the right area.

01:08:15.176 --> 01:08:16.176
You're...

01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:18.595
You're nearby?

01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:23.559
I spoke with soldiers from the 3rd ID
who were escorting your convoy.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.060
They're alive?

01:08:26.604 --> 01:08:30.524
Not all of them.
Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.611
The rest got caught in small arms fire

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:37.363
What the hell happened out there, Paul?

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:39.073
Paul?

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:40.868
Wait.

01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:42.453
Paul?

01:08:43.621 --> 01:08:46.247
I

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.559
I

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:28.916
FUCK!

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:50.187
Come on. Come on.

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:54.441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.485
Come on.

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:57.987
Hello?

01:09:58.487 --> 01:10:00.406
Hello, who's there?
- Ls this Paul Conroy?

01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:02.575
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Paul. Who are you?

01:10:02.658 --> 01:10:04.451
Paul, my name 's Alan Davenport.

01:10:04.577 --> 01:10:07.037
I'm the Personnel Director
here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:08.289
Yeah, yeah. I left you a message.

01:10:08.372 --> 01:10:12.251
You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning
over at the State Department.

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:14.378
Are you able to speak
on the status of your situation?

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:18.340
It's worse. There was an explosion or
something, and the sand's coming through.

01:10:18.424 --> 01:10:20.926
I probably have about half an hour
before it fills right up.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:23.387
Slow down. You should try to stay calm.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:25.973
0 CD 0 CD 0.
Q)

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:29.560
The hostage-takers, Dan Brenner
from the hostage working group...

01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:32.438
Okay, Paul. I'm with you.
Now, how about the media?

01:10:32.521 --> 01:10:33.898
I know your ransom video leaked,

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:36.066
but have you spoken directly to anyone
about what's going on?

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:37.568
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Good, good, good, good.

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:38.944
It needs to stay that way.

01:10:39.028 --> 01:10:42.323
It's important we keep this situation
as contained as possible.

01:10:42.406 --> 01:10:44.575
The situation is in a coffin!

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.912
I think it's pretty contained!
Help me! Help me!

01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:49.914
What are you doing right now to help me?

01:10:49.997 --> 01:10:52.333
I know you're upset.
But from what I've been told,

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:55.419
they're extremely close
to getting you out of there.

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:57.379
So hopefully it won't be too much longer

01:10:57.463 --> 01:11:00.716
- Thank God.
- Yeah, thank God.

01:11:02.343 --> 01:11:05.346
Now, I'm going to switch on a recorder
right now.

01:11:05.429 --> 01:11:07.556
- What?
- Just a second.

01:11:10.643 --> 01:11:12.227
This is Alan Davenport,

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:16.231
Personnel Director
at Crestin, Roland and Thomas Incorporated.

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:19.693
The date is October 23, 2006.

01:11:19.777 --> 01:11:22.863
I'm speaking with Paul Conroy.

01:11:22.947 --> 01:11:26.992
Mr Conroy are you aware
that I'm recording this conversation?

01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:29.536
- What?
- Please answer the question.

01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:31.372
- Shit.
- Mn Conroy?

01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:32.581
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:32.665 --> 01:11:34.792
And do I have your permission to do so?

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:37.503
Why do you need my permission?
What's this about?

01:11:37.586 --> 01:11:39.296
I need you to answer yes or no, please.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.548
- Yes! Yes, all right?
- Thank you.

01:11:41.632 --> 01:11:44.510
Now, Mr Conroy,
when were you hired by CRT?

01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:47.972
I don't... Nine months ago.
Around January. What is all this?

01:11:48.055 --> 01:11:51.308
I have your official date of hire
as January 4th.

01:11:51.392 --> 01:11:52.977
- Ls that correct?
- Who cares?

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.561
This is fucking crazy.

01:11:54.645 --> 01:11:57.606
- January 4th. Ls that correct?
- Yes!

01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:01.026
And during your initial training,
before being sent to Iraq,

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.239
you were made aware of the dangers inherent
to the position for which you were hired.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:08.242
You mean when I came down there to Dallas,
and you guys said that all of the trucks

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.369
would be armored
and have bulletproof glass?

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:13.247
You mean when you told us
that things were safer than ever over here?

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.832
Is that when...
Is that when I was made aware?

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:17.668
I need you to answer yes or no, please.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:19.378
Yes.

01:12:19.461 --> 01:12:24.383
During that time, did you also receive
and sign an employment contract with CRT,

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:26.552
which thoroughly explained company policy

01:12:26.635 --> 01:12:28.429
as it pertained
to your specific terms of employment?

01:12:28.554 --> 01:12:30.264
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I signed a bunch of things. Yeah.

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:34.143
- Yes or no?
- Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.

01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:36.937
It's our understanding
that you were taken hostage in Iraq

01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:39.148
two hours ago, is that also correct?

01:12:39.231 --> 01:12:42.860
Yes! I think that’s a fair assessment of the situation,
you fucking dick.

01:12:42.943 --> 01:12:44.194
What's the point of all this?

01:12:44.278 --> 01:12:48.407
Our legal department requires that
we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees,

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:53.495
confirming that they understand the reasons
for their forced separation from the company.

01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:57.249
As of this morning, your employment with CRT was officially terminated.

01:12:57.332 --> 01:12:59.668
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. What?

01:12:59.752 --> 01:13:02.171
It was brought to our attention
that you were engaging

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:06.383
in relations with a fellow CRT employee,
Pamela Lutti.

01:13:07.176 --> 01:13:09.803
- No. No, no. Hold on, hold on.
- Stipulated in your contract

01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:13.557
was a fraternization clause,
in which it was stated quite clearly

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.184
- that any relationship...
- Stop, stop, stop. Please.

01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:17.436
...be it romantic or sexual in nature...

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:19.063
- We were just friends.
- ...deemed inappropriate

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:21.899
By CRT senior officials
is grounds for immediate termination.

01:13:21.982 --> 01:13:24.902
Hold on. Okay?
We were just friends. We were just friends.

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:27.571
- Our records indicate differently.
- Your records are wrong.

01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:29.948
We 're also legally required to inform you

01:13:30.032 --> 01:13:32.076
that because you were technically no longer

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:35.621
under the employ of CRT
at the time of your abduction,

01:13:35.704 --> 01:13:38.165
we cannot be held accountable for any injury

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:42.920
that may befall upon you after
your official date and time of termination.

01:13:43.003 --> 01:13:46.256
Therefore, in your case,
that includes this incident,

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:49.051
or any consequences that may result from it.

01:13:50.803 --> 01:13:54.473
What about my insurance money?
My family's gonna need that money.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:58.227
Given that you were alive
up until the time of your termination...

01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.853
Don't do this.

01:14:00.771 --> 01:14:03.107
- Do you understand everything?
- Don't do this!

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:06.485
Do you understand
everything you've been told, Mn Conroy?

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:11.782
Mn Conroy?

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:15.369
You're a piece of shit.

01:14:16.703 --> 01:14:19.998
That concludes our interview
with Paul Conroy.

01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:22.376
I am now turning off the recorder

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:26.630
You put me here.

01:14:31.135 --> 01:14:32.469
I'm sorry.

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:30.420
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:53.527
Come on. Why won't you answer the phone?

01:18:09.311 --> 01:18:10.687
Paul, is that you?

01:18:10.771 --> 01:18:12.272
They're dead.

01:18:12.481 --> 01:18:14.566
- How do you know that?
- I just do.

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:18.862
Three F-16s leveled parts of the city
a few minutes ago.

01:18:18.945 --> 01:18:20.947
Yeah, I know.

01:18:21.573 --> 01:18:23.116
Yeah, that was fun for me.

01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:28.455
Did they know I was here?

01:18:29.915 --> 01:18:31.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:34.544
Did they care?

01:18:39.758 --> 01:18:43.678
These people that took me, if they're dead,

01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:47.140
they can't tell you where I am.

01:18:47.808 --> 01:18:50.352
We can still try to track down your signal.

01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:53.313
You tried that already.

01:18:53.522 --> 01:18:55.482
We can try again.

01:19:04.032 --> 01:19:06.410
- It's over, isn't it?
- No.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.998
Yeah.

01:19:17.546 --> 01:19:19.172
What should I do?

01:19:21.842 --> 01:19:23.176
I don't know.

01:19:25.262 --> 01:19:26.638
It's weird.

01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:29.015
What is?

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:32.185
Knowing.

01:19:35.522 --> 01:19:38.316
I wish this could have gone differently Paul.

01:19:40.444 --> 01:19:41.778
Yeah.

01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:45.824
Me, too.

01:20:03.341 --> 01:20:05.552
My name is Paul Steven Conroy.

01:20:07.387 --> 01:20:12.934
Social security number, 048-32-1198.
Date of birth. 3/23/76.

01:20:15.854 --> 01:20:19.941
This video will serve as my last will
and testament.

01:20:22.194 --> 01:20:23.612
Um...

01:20:25.572 --> 01:20:27.782
To my wife, Linda Conroy,

01:20:29.075 --> 01:20:32.370
I leave you the $700 in my personal savings,

01:20:34.998 --> 01:20:37.751
and whatever's left in my annuity.

01:20:39.044 --> 01:20:42.923
To my son, Shane Conroy,

01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:48.428
I don’t know

01:20:49.763 --> 01:20:52.974
I don't have... My clothes.

01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:57.812
I leave you my clothes,
which you will grow into.

01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:01.942
Not these ones.

01:21:05.946 --> 01:21:07.948
I don't really have...

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:12.035
I wish that I had more for you, but...

01:21:14.246 --> 01:21:18.250
Maybe if I was a famous baseball player,
or some guy who wore a suit to work...

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:22.629
Then I'd have more.

01:21:23.171 --> 01:21:27.092
But, you know, you can be
one of those people if you want. Um...

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:31.221
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:32.222 --> 01:21:35.934
Just promise me that when you get older
that you'll take good care of your mom.

01:21:36.017 --> 01:21:38.728
And, I don't know.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:42.816
You always try to do the right thing.

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:48.947
I love you very much, Shane.

01:21:51.783 --> 01:21:56.413
Maybe I never said that enough. Maybe I did.
I don't know.

01:21:57.622 --> 01:22:00.667
That probably means I didn't. And...

01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:11.303
I'm sorry, Linda.
I should have listened to you.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:22.374
You're not dead. Hello? Hello?

01:23:22.457 --> 01:23:23.875
Where is money?

01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:26.461
- I don't know.
- What don't know?

01:23:26.544 --> 01:23:28.004
- I don’t know where it is.
- Liar!

01:23:28.088 --> 01:23:29.547
