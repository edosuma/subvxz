WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:04.747
Do you believe you did the
things they say you did?

00:04.748 --> 00:08.360
If I did, I wasn't
arrested, I was rescued.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.497
The truth of a confession is immaterial.

00:10.498 --> 00:13.722
What is of crucial importance is
how the confession was obtained.

00:13.757 --> 00:16.280
I'm suggesting Gibson
deliberately provoked him.

00:16.335 --> 00:18.237
How were we to know
she was that desperate?

00:18.271 --> 00:20.762
Now you can add attempted
murder to her list of charges.

00:20.782 --> 00:23.412
- Are you Sean Healy?
- Yes!

00:23.439 --> 00:25.389
Will you give this to Paul for me?

00:25.509 --> 00:28.719
Paul Spector is due to be moved today.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.266
The next stage of his

00:30.626 --> 00:33.061
assessments are about to begin.

00:35.503 --> 00:39.401
Mr Spector. I'm August Larson,

00:39.727 --> 00:42.849
- the lead clinician here.
- I need you to go to London.

00:42.852 --> 00:45.552
I don't think we can afford
to dismiss the connection

00:45.580 --> 00:48.216
between David Alvarez and Paul Spector.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.340
We've had a request to
disclose your dream diary.

00:51.460 --> 00:54.093
He's in hospital, he's incapacitated

00:54.213 --> 00:56.788
and yet he's still infecting
the lives of every person

00:56.828 --> 00:58.168
he comes into contact with.

00:58.546 --> 01:00.827
If a person is able to do to others

01:00.841 --> 01:02.616
what he fears may be done to him,

01:03.300 --> 01:05.036
he may no longer be afraid.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.339
Doctor, I understand that
for you he's a patient,

01:08.459 --> 01:11.957
someone worthy of
understanding, compassion, even.

01:12.250 --> 01:13.755
But to me he's a...

01:13.875 --> 01:15.353
He's a sexual predator.

01:15.562 --> 01:17.729
I'm Mark Bailey, who are you?

01:18.195 --> 01:20.144
I'm told I'm the Belfast Strangler.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.607 --> 01:38.017
Detective Superintendent Gibson?

01:38.589 --> 01:41.495
Dr Larson. What can I do for you?

01:41.517 --> 01:43.630
Mr Spector's defence team

01:43.660 --> 01:46.762
have sent me some
excerpts from your diary.

01:46.793 --> 01:49.063
The pages where it is alleged

01:49.063 --> 01:51.044
Mr Spector made an entry.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.500
I see.

02:01.223 --> 02:02.900
I sense your discomfort.

02:04.497 --> 02:06.040
I have no doubt,

02:06.106 --> 02:08.253
after seeing the entry he made,

02:08.287 --> 02:12.210
knowing that he'd read your
journal felt like a violation.

02:12.537 --> 02:13.830
Yes.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.350
May I ask you,

02:17.065 --> 02:19.151
how long have you kept a diary?

02:20.714 --> 02:22.315
All of my life.

02:23.746 --> 02:26.194
But not really since
I've been in Belfast.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.529
I don't follow.

02:31.060 --> 02:34.223
What Spector wrote in was
more of a dream journal.

02:35.983 --> 02:38.074
Why do you keep a dream journal?

02:41.055 --> 02:42.514
Why do you want to know?

02:43.991 --> 02:45.583
Curiosity, probably.

02:47.603 --> 02:51.016
Initially, I kept it as
an investigative tool.

02:52.276 --> 02:55.472
I trained myself to wake up in
the middle of the night and...

02:57.034 --> 02:59.035
... write down random thoughts.

02:59.912 --> 03:01.887
Then I guess since then, it's

03:03.379 --> 03:05.804
become a compulsion, of sorts.

03:07.036 --> 03:09.954
So you see dreams as a
kind of problem-solving?

03:11.969 --> 03:15.448
I think maybe the sleeping brain makes

03:15.720 --> 03:19.005
connections more quickly
than the waking mind does.

03:20.053 --> 03:21.834
That is certainly possible.

03:25.234 --> 03:28.000
I will treat the entries with respect.

03:28.754 --> 03:29.874
Thank you.

03:31.241 --> 03:33.034
Goodnight, Dr Larson.

03:33.678 --> 03:35.032
Goodnight.

05:20.775 --> 05:22.890
Oi! What's all this!

06:08.154 --> 06:09.700
Paul Spector,

06:09.741 --> 06:12.954
a 32-year-old, right-handed male.

06:13.168 --> 06:15.644
Referred from the
criminal justice system

06:15.664 --> 06:18.529
for appraisal with regard to his fitness

06:18.592 --> 06:20.534
to plead and stand trial.

06:21.474 --> 06:25.084
The charge sheet gives you
an idea of the alleged crimes.

06:26.074 --> 06:27.755
Shot in police custody,

06:27.782 --> 06:30.072
he underwent a splenectomy

06:30.093 --> 06:34.178
so we should be mindful of
his post-operative condition

06:34.234 --> 06:36.502
and ongoing medical needs.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.824
In hospital, after
regaining consciousness,

06:41.039 --> 06:44.251
he presented with
severe retrograde amnesia

06:44.271 --> 06:48.024
in the absence of significant
anterograde amnesia.

06:48.829 --> 06:52.714
I'm told Paul Spector never
knew his biological father.

06:53.199 --> 06:56.265
His mother, Mary Garrison,

06:56.508 --> 07:00.275
committed suicide when
he was eight years old.

07:01.925 --> 07:03.562
She hanged herself.

07:04.936 --> 07:08.189
After a period of two
years in a foster home

07:08.309 --> 07:12.649
that appears to have been a
stable and safe environment,

07:13.514 --> 07:16.569
he was transferred to Gortnacull House.

07:16.794 --> 07:18.554
He was there for three years.

07:19.392 --> 07:23.234
At 13 he was sent to
another home in the South,

07:23.234 --> 07:26.176
Dundalk, County Louth.

07:26.613 --> 07:30.103
Apart from a very agitated first wake up

07:30.311 --> 07:33.744
and a violent emotional response

07:33.864 --> 07:37.455
to being presented with some
of the evidence against him,

07:37.514 --> 07:41.754
the hospital reports
him having been docile,

07:41.754 --> 07:43.448
co-operative,

07:44.010 --> 07:46.292
friendly, even.

07:46.874 --> 07:48.560
It is also very possible

07:48.581 --> 07:53.297
he is someone who acts out in
a dangerous and illegal manner.

07:53.658 --> 07:57.872
The police officer Detective
Superintendent Gibson...

07:58.357 --> 08:02.097
... who at this stage might well
be the person who knows him best,

08:02.114 --> 08:04.690
suggests he has a narcissistic,

08:04.739 --> 08:06.757
sadistic personality.

08:07.604 --> 08:10.517
With regard to his memory loss,

08:10.884 --> 08:12.480
he could be feigning,

08:12.834 --> 08:16.095
exaggerating or simply

08:16.795 --> 08:18.266
malingering.

08:18.674 --> 08:22.567
So I suggest we approach
Mr Spector with...

08:23.039 --> 08:25.813
respectful scepticism.

08:28.434 --> 08:30.783
The daily structure
is 8 to 9, breakfast,

08:30.818 --> 08:32.552
9 to 10, self-care tasks,

08:32.594 --> 08:35.154
washing, dressing, laundry, bed-making.

08:35.274 --> 08:38.073
10 to 12 is therapy or
a 45-minute activity...

08:38.073 --> 08:39.794
art, music whatever.

08:39.794 --> 08:41.794
12 to 2 is lunch and rest period.

08:41.794 --> 08:45.683
2 to 4 is therapy or further activity...

08:45.725 --> 08:49.560
life skills, relaxation,
self-awareness, cooking.

08:50.094 --> 08:53.403
5 to 6.30 is dinner and rest.

08:53.434 --> 08:55.956
And 6.30 to 9.30 is leisure...

08:55.963 --> 08:57.503
pool, watching a movie.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.305
Back in your room at
9.30. Lights out at 10.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.851
Dr Larson will see
you later this morning.

09:03.066 --> 09:04.870
Collect your breakfast there.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.852
All right? Eh, wee fry. Just a wee one.

09:08.157 --> 09:09.714
You all right, mate?

09:39.834 --> 09:41.654
Ma'am.

09:41.695 --> 09:44.185
- Yeah.
- I have a copy of the letter you asked for.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.114
Thanks.

09:57.566 --> 10:00.049
"I probably shouldn't
write this letter to you

10:00.105 --> 10:02.928
but this is hard evidence
to you that I exist,

10:03.048 --> 10:05.030
exist for you, Paul.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.541
I can feel you all over me,

10:07.929 --> 10:09.830
like that night in your study,

10:10.634 --> 10:12.715
I feel you crawling through my veins,

10:12.728 --> 10:14.053
through my mind,

10:14.566 --> 10:17.313
you grab and suffocate my thoughts.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.893
I am in pain for your pleasure.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.410
I have forsaken my friends,

10:23.591 --> 10:25.547
I have forsaken my family,

10:26.344 --> 10:29.001
I am choosing my next move carefully.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.839
Their love is fake.

10:31.959 --> 10:34.898
Fuck everyone who wants
me to step into the light.

10:35.411 --> 10:37.402
It will burn my skin off.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.074
The skin that I will
carve our poetry into

10:40.074 --> 10:42.216
so you will be with me for ever.

10:43.187 --> 10:46.856
I yearn for you when I stare
into the starless midnight.

10:46.976 --> 10:49.499
You are the vast expanse of the sky.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.077
I don't regret a thing,
because the pain is all for you.

10:54.562 --> 10:58.010
I will still love you when I
finally know everything about you.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.889
That's true love."

11:01.041 --> 11:02.955
I fucking hate this.

11:03.226 --> 11:05.210
I hate being without you.

11:05.612 --> 11:08.733
I would kill them all
if I could. Crush them.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.369
Crush them and their pathetic lives."

11:19.754 --> 11:23.689
Ma'am, my client accepts that she
has breached her bail conditions.

11:23.869 --> 11:26.241
Her attempts to contact Mr Spector,

11:26.297 --> 11:28.530
the fact that she stayed
away from her home address,

11:28.558 --> 11:30.074
breaching her curfew.

11:30.292 --> 11:32.462
But there are mitigating factors, Ma'am,

11:32.475 --> 11:34.594
that I'd like to draw your attention to.

11:35.634 --> 11:38.434
The defendant lost her
father when she was aged 13

11:38.457 --> 11:40.154
in a motorcycle accident,

11:40.332 --> 11:42.463
a shockingly violent accident.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.534
She is now just 16 years old

11:44.551 --> 11:47.586
and the best place for her to be
at this difficult time is at home.

11:48.024 --> 11:50.299
Her mother, who is
present today in court,

11:50.332 --> 11:52.974
is prepared to stand surety.
I have checked with the police

11:53.035 --> 11:54.623
and they are happy as to the source

11:54.639 --> 11:56.310
of the monies offered by Mrs Benedetto

11:56.342 --> 11:57.851
to support the suretyship,

11:57.885 --> 12:00.372
- namely savings she has accumulated to...
- Mr McSwain,

12:00.388 --> 12:01.903
let me just stop you there.

12:02.714 --> 12:06.692
Now, your client is not just in
breach of her bail conditions,

12:06.748 --> 12:09.072
she is alleged by the prosecution

12:09.133 --> 12:12.034
to have committed another
very serious offence:

12:12.346 --> 12:15.274
throwing a corrosive
fluid with intent to harm.

12:15.274 --> 12:17.352
Had it not been for the
quick thinking of a friend,

12:17.357 --> 12:19.393
who irrigated her eyes with a drink,

12:19.654 --> 12:21.768
the victim might well
have lost her sight.

12:22.207 --> 12:24.349
Now, I feel I have no choice, therefore,

12:24.469 --> 12:28.300
other than to remand her to the Seapark
Juvenile Justice Centre in Bangor.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.492
There she will be
appointed a case manager

12:30.514 --> 12:32.554
and a key worker who
can assess her needs.

12:32.784 --> 12:34.582
She will be able to attend school also,

12:34.599 --> 12:36.586
- if she so wishes.
- I don't care what you do,

12:36.913 --> 12:38.733
or what you think, or say.

12:39.865 --> 12:42.212
The only one who's honest is Paul.

12:42.754 --> 12:45.014
He's the only person
I choose to listen to,

12:45.134 --> 12:46.829
the only person who sees this world

12:46.840 --> 12:48.177
for what it really is.

12:49.786 --> 12:53.133
Full of sheep like you
being fattened for slaughter.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.973
Pigs waiting for the butcher.

12:56.394 --> 12:58.869
You have a lawyer to
look after your interests.

12:58.989 --> 13:00.756
Any issues you may have,

13:00.790 --> 13:02.327
you address them through him.

13:02.714 --> 13:03.953
Fuck you.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.634
Fuck you all.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.837
Security, please!

13:16.674 --> 13:19.874
- You requested all the Susan Harper files?
- That's right.

13:19.907 --> 13:22.104
This is everything that we have here.

13:22.376 --> 13:23.635
Well, thank you.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.572
OK, so this is what I'm thinking.

13:40.692 --> 13:42.175
We lodge civil proceedings

13:42.203 --> 13:44.057
and make an abuse of
process application.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.317
Adverse publicity?

13:45.344 --> 13:47.994
That certainly, but
also police misconduct.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.434
Specifically, Detective
Superintendent Gibson.

13:50.671 --> 13:53.268
I want you to draw together
all the strands of police

13:53.290 --> 13:56.394
and prosecution behaviour
that has been questionable.

13:56.514 --> 13:59.494
- Starting with the stage-managed arrest?
- Before that.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.995
From the point the
investigation assumed his guilt

14:03.028 --> 14:04.887
and focused on him and him alone.

14:05.825 --> 14:07.584
Stage managing the arrest,

14:07.972 --> 14:09.737
the additional sexual oppression,

14:09.754 --> 14:11.373
the failure to bring him to court

14:11.378 --> 14:13.565
promptly once he was charged, all of it

14:14.003 --> 14:16.234
a vendetta from the
start against our client.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.274
Do you think that adds up to
misconduct of sufficient gravity?

14:19.313 --> 14:21.394
- To warrant a stay?
- Maybe not,

14:21.771 --> 14:23.552
but it will certainly cause a delay.

14:24.135 --> 14:27.437
We need more than just issues
of competency to work with.

14:27.794 --> 14:30.794
The abuse of process
application more than adds up.

14:32.426 --> 14:34.502
You suspect that

14:35.662 --> 14:37.865
Gibson had a previous
relationship with Burns.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.954
It seems she has also had
liaisons with other colleagues.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.173
Spector was in the hotel room

14:44.201 --> 14:45.743
when Burns was there with Gibson.

14:46.394 --> 14:47.925
Let's assume therefore that Spector

14:47.941 --> 14:49.739
had knowledge of that relationship.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.641
He also had access to her dream diary

14:52.697 --> 14:55.622
which gave him insights
into her other liaisons.

14:55.893 --> 14:59.301
What if the damage this could
cause Stella Gibson's career

14:59.323 --> 15:02.286
was a possible motive for her failure

15:02.303 --> 15:03.995
to protect him in the forest?

15:04.323 --> 15:06.659
Spector's whereabouts were leaked

15:06.670 --> 15:09.212
by a detention officer
within the custody suite.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.637
What if Gibson was in on that leak?

15:12.242 --> 15:15.444
What if Spector's life was
deliberately put at risk

15:15.466 --> 15:17.480
by Gibson through police misconduct?

15:17.530 --> 15:20.067
Everyone knew Tyler was
out there with a loaded gun

15:20.067 --> 15:23.434
and a clearly stated aim
to find and kill Spector.

15:23.554 --> 15:25.044
And she let it happen.

15:26.270 --> 15:27.554
Let's make her pay.

15:58.714 --> 16:00.190
Do you have your own room key?

16:02.321 --> 16:03.298
No.

16:06.338 --> 16:07.487
I do.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.234
I'm allowed to feed the
fish in the aquarium.

16:16.238 --> 16:18.430
I used to help with
serving the meals but

16:18.857 --> 16:21.500
I gave larger portions
to people I liked so,

16:22.938 --> 16:24.634
I'm not allowed to do that any more.

16:30.107 --> 16:31.777
I have art today, so...

16:37.304 --> 16:40.012
Wasn't well, better now.

16:40.656 --> 16:42.487
Wasn't well, better now.

16:48.469 --> 16:50.661
"I don't think there
was any criminal intent.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.976
She approached you,

16:51.993 --> 16:53.985
she invited you back to her place.

16:54.196 --> 16:56.471
I'm not saying she was
asking for it necessarily,

16:56.493 --> 16:58.829
but we've all been
there, too much to drink,

16:59.006 --> 17:01.903
one thing leads to another,
things get out of hand.

17:02.114 --> 17:04.467
We're used to dealing with
these sorts of offences.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.598
We understand how these
things can happen."

17:06.903 --> 17:08.513
What officer is that talking?

17:08.513 --> 17:10.114
Er, this is Rees.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.473
"What did she do to anger you, David?

17:12.473 --> 17:15.028
Did she insult you?
What made it turn nasty?

17:17.034 --> 17:19.623
Was she still dressed
when you had sex with her?"

17:20.361 --> 17:21.964
"Alvarez: Maybe."

17:22.314 --> 17:23.796
"She wasn't was she? She was naked.

17:23.807 --> 17:25.333
Did she ask you to tie her up?

17:25.453 --> 17:26.460
David?

17:26.579 --> 17:29.062
Was she into bondage? Tell
us how you killed her."

17:29.645 --> 17:31.060
"I strangled her."

17:31.515 --> 17:33.119
"How did you strangle her?"

17:33.502 --> 17:34.628
"With my belt."

17:35.314 --> 17:38.623
"You see, David, if you say
that, you're not helping me.

17:38.743 --> 17:41.548
- You didn't use your belt, did you?"
- "No."

17:41.753 --> 17:43.202
"What did you use?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.966
Come on, David, think
about what you used."

17:46.248 --> 17:49.650
"Hathaway: You'd taken
your clothes off, David.

17:49.656 --> 17:51.148
You were naked, weren't you?"

17:52.115 --> 17:53.169
"Yes."

17:53.208 --> 17:55.056
"So what did you use to strangle her?"

17:55.949 --> 17:58.169
"Just my hands, just my bare hands."

17:58.397 --> 18:01.565
"There were no strangulation
marks on her neck, David. None.

18:01.685 --> 18:03.952
Were there any pillows
on the bed, David?"

18:04.594 --> 18:07.131
"I smothered her. I took a pillow

18:07.131 --> 18:09.301
and put it over her
face and smothered her."

18:09.745 --> 18:11.310
I mean, Jesus, there's

18:11.820 --> 18:14.934
leading the witness and there's
shoving words down his throat.

18:19.754 --> 18:21.942
Why weren't Alvarez's
defence all over this?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.997
I'm afraid the typical relationship

18:27.003 --> 18:29.227
between a psychiatrist and patient,

18:29.288 --> 18:32.230
where everything that is said
in this room is confidential,

18:32.235 --> 18:33.390
does not apply.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.458
Anything you tell me
can be put in the report.

18:36.896 --> 18:39.422
Because it is the
Court that has asked me

18:39.427 --> 18:41.514
to conduct the evaluation,

18:41.747 --> 18:44.700
you don't have the right
to refuse to participate.

18:45.354 --> 18:47.147
Even if you, for example,

18:47.164 --> 18:49.074
choose not to answer my questions,

18:49.378 --> 18:52.657
I will still need to
provide the written report

18:52.713 --> 18:54.394
that will be sent to the court

18:54.405 --> 18:56.763
and made available to your lawyer.

18:57.279 --> 19:00.831
If the judge orders a hearing
on the issue of your competency

19:00.875 --> 19:03.217
I might be called to testify in court.

19:04.834 --> 19:06.236
Do you understand?

19:06.356 --> 19:07.506
Yes, I do.

19:07.734 --> 19:09.304
I will answer your questions.

19:10.394 --> 19:11.674
Good.

19:11.954 --> 19:13.194
That's good.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.067
Tom. Have a look at this.

19:20.914 --> 19:23.674
This was a key part of
the prosecution's case.

19:23.794 --> 19:26.234
That's the victim, Susan
Harper, and that's David Alvarez

19:26.240 --> 19:27.794
leaving the nightclub together.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.194
Who is that, do you think?

19:39.074 --> 19:42.474
Do you understand the
police's version of events?

19:43.414 --> 19:45.667
The severity of the charges?

19:47.593 --> 19:48.834
Yes, I do.

19:50.954 --> 19:53.298
Do you remember making a confession?

19:55.834 --> 19:56.914
No.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.248
Can you provide a reasonable account

20:02.259 --> 20:04.090
of your behaviour around the time

20:04.107 --> 20:06.155
of the various alleged offences?

20:07.976 --> 20:09.034
No.

20:11.339 --> 20:12.949
Or your state of mind?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.594
No.

20:22.274 --> 20:24.668
Do you think you could
manage your emotions

20:24.690 --> 20:26.714
and behaviour in a courtroom?

20:29.151 --> 20:30.754
I think I could, yes.

20:30.874 --> 20:33.163
Do you think you would
be able to keep track

20:33.186 --> 20:35.938
of events as they unfolded?

20:38.794 --> 20:39.954
Yes.

20:41.034 --> 20:43.768
Would you be able to
challenge witnesses?

20:43.996 --> 20:46.082
That is, to recognise

20:46.093 --> 20:48.413
distortions in witness testimony?

20:51.243 --> 20:53.034
No, I wouldn't be able to do that.

20:54.474 --> 20:55.766
Not unless my

20:55.982 --> 20:57.353
memory returned.

20:58.581 --> 21:02.274
Do you understand the sentence
that could be imposed on you

21:02.283 --> 21:04.042
if you are found guilty?

21:06.128 --> 21:08.354
I would spend the rest
of my life in prison.

21:14.195 --> 21:16.537
Will my memory return, Doctor?

21:18.246 --> 21:19.650
Do you want it to?

21:27.362 --> 21:29.474
I might have something
significant, ma'am.

21:29.474 --> 21:31.480
A Peter Baldwin working as a waiter

21:31.480 --> 21:34.754
in a Caribbean restaurant
called the Plantain Garden.

21:35.182 --> 21:36.994
And the restaurant went bust,

21:37.024 --> 21:38.805
closed in 2008,

21:39.088 --> 21:41.180
but the owner still has his paperwork.

21:41.807 --> 21:45.070
He had reason to give
Peter Baldwin a warning,

21:45.190 --> 21:47.722
a reprimand that stayed on file.

21:48.354 --> 21:53.027
It's dated Saturday
August the 17th, 2002.

21:54.392 --> 21:56.090
The day before the Harper murder.

21:57.815 --> 21:59.308
Why was he reprimanded?

21:59.374 --> 22:01.683
An argument with a
customer that turned nasty,

22:01.694 --> 22:02.854
came to blows.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.954
And the owner positively
identified Spector?

22:06.954 --> 22:09.369
I sent him all the
photographs we have on file.

22:09.489 --> 22:11.314
He seems pretty certain.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.634
The restaurant was in SW9.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.522
Susan Harper's flat was in SW16.

22:21.649 --> 22:23.519
That's Brixton and Streatham.

22:24.754 --> 22:25.994
Both in Lambeth.

23:06.213 --> 23:08.244
I will, thanks for letting us know.

23:17.079 --> 23:19.634
The police say they have fresh
evidence to put to Spector.

23:19.754 --> 23:21.313
What sort of evidence?

23:21.662 --> 23:23.994
Forensic, documentary.

23:24.198 --> 23:26.922
Apparently they have found
a lock-up rented by Spector.

23:26.983 --> 23:29.194
They want to interview
him about the contents.

23:29.254 --> 23:30.634
Oh, fuck!

23:31.046 --> 23:32.438
I'll need to see proof of that

23:32.460 --> 23:34.419
and all the information that
was placed before the judge

23:34.441 --> 23:35.701
to get those warrants.

23:35.717 --> 23:37.610
Get back to the PPS first
thing in the morning.

23:37.634 --> 23:39.181
I want full disclosure.

23:39.547 --> 23:41.900
Oh also, contact The Foyle,

23:42.166 --> 23:45.194
see if Larson thinks Spector's
fit to be interviewed.

23:47.439 --> 23:48.671
Fuck!

23:51.034 --> 23:52.549
It could be Spector.

23:52.938 --> 23:55.712
Rose Stagg puts Spector in
London at the right time.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.320
22 years old, clean-shaven.

23:59.219 --> 24:00.745
It's hard to tell.

24:01.045 --> 24:02.454
No, it's not.

24:03.148 --> 24:04.394
That's him.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.594
I know it's him.

24:07.854 --> 24:10.495
Well, we couldn't quite believe
the interrogation tactics...

24:10.723 --> 24:12.809
a classic old school interview...

24:12.834 --> 24:15.434
trickery, deceit,
psychological manipulation.

24:15.434 --> 24:17.754
Alvarez thought he'd be able
to go home after confessing.

24:17.754 --> 24:19.234
And it seems he fell for it all.

24:19.354 --> 24:21.434
For some reason he
seemed eager to please.

24:21.434 --> 24:23.594
I've no idea why the defence
team weren't all over it.

24:23.642 --> 24:25.471
All the evidence was pretty strong,

24:26.128 --> 24:28.258
the only other fingerprints
found ather flat

24:28.262 --> 24:29.891
were Alvarez's and the only

24:30.100 --> 24:32.328
DNA recovered from her body was his.

24:32.394 --> 24:33.230
True,

24:34.167 --> 24:35.440
but when it comes to the actual murder

24:35.454 --> 24:37.057
they had to lead him by the nose

24:37.079 --> 24:38.775
to get him to where
they wanted him to be.

24:39.326 --> 24:41.692
He really seemed to
lack detailed knowledge.

24:42.753 --> 24:44.634
I have a good feeling about this.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.714
I can smell Spector's involvement.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.782
And when do you see Alvarez?

24:53.026 --> 24:54.065
In the morning.

24:55.144 --> 24:56.794
Call me with any developments.

24:58.846 --> 24:59.743
Goodnight.

24:59.805 --> 25:00.724
Goodnight.

25:38.594 --> 25:41.640
We can order things off the nurses.

25:42.473 --> 25:44.570
They go shopping twice a week. You just

25:44.898 --> 25:47.273
give them the money and they'll
get you the things you want.

25:49.171 --> 25:50.602
I don't have any money.

25:51.594 --> 25:52.634
Oh.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.139
Why are you in this place?

26:05.323 --> 26:07.176
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

26:08.503 --> 26:10.401
I twisted my sister's arm.

26:13.434 --> 26:15.744
I twisted it so far round it broke.

26:17.154 --> 26:18.674
Why did you do that?

26:20.874 --> 26:22.636
I had a haircut.

26:23.358 --> 26:24.407
It...

26:25.600 --> 26:27.264
gave me a new personality.

26:27.270 --> 26:28.729
It made me more feminine.

26:30.249 --> 26:32.430
I thought I was turning homosexual.

26:32.994 --> 26:35.854
When I came home, my
sister said I looked gay.

26:35.871 --> 26:37.702
So I twisted her arm.

26:38.129 --> 26:40.126
She was screaming and I didn't stop.

26:40.954 --> 26:42.246
Then it snapped.

26:43.372 --> 26:45.842
Then I suppose I... panicked.

26:49.554 --> 26:50.814
How old was she?

26:51.594 --> 26:52.929
Younger than me.

26:53.834 --> 26:56.194
- How much younger?
- Quite a lot younger.

27:00.854 --> 27:02.452
What's your diagnosis?

27:02.674 --> 27:05.071
A psychotic with convulsive disorder.

27:08.622 --> 27:10.320
They say I had

27:10.564 --> 27:12.329
childhood schizophrenia.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.634
I thought there were hidden
messages in the colours of cars

27:16.640 --> 27:18.366
passing on the street.

27:18.874 --> 27:22.378
I started communicating with car sounds.

27:22.999 --> 27:25.307
And then the sounds turned into voices.

27:26.384 --> 27:27.899
What kind of voices?

27:28.171 --> 27:29.091
Like...

27:29.868 --> 27:31.139
people, but

27:31.683 --> 27:33.653
just out of hearing.

27:37.969 --> 27:40.474
When I'm bad, I see faces in the mirror.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.445
The risperidone helps.

27:49.117 --> 27:51.114
How long have you been in this place?

27:51.481 --> 27:52.879
Five years.

27:53.474 --> 27:55.360
I was on the news, but

27:55.837 --> 27:57.235
not like you.

27:57.785 --> 27:59.767
It's time to go to your room now, Paul.

28:21.369 --> 28:23.345
12, is the answer to your question.

28:23.367 --> 28:24.594
What?

28:24.643 --> 28:26.091
Mark Bailey's sister.

28:26.291 --> 28:27.545
12 years old.

28:28.222 --> 28:29.859
And he left out the best bit.

28:31.954 --> 28:33.714
After he broke his sister's arm,

28:33.834 --> 28:34.958
he raped her,

28:35.413 --> 28:36.889
then carried her into the street,

28:37.205 --> 28:39.941
threw her into a passing bin
lorry that crushed her to death.

28:42.449 --> 28:44.253
The dregs of humanity.

28:45.434 --> 28:46.699
Sweet dreams.

29:10.676 --> 29:11.874
Anderson.

29:14.277 --> 29:16.891
It's Assistant Chief Constable Burns.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.834
Er, good evening, sir.

29:21.003 --> 29:23.578
I understand you're
seeing Alvarez tomorrow?

29:23.756 --> 29:25.034
Yes, sir.

29:33.977 --> 29:36.829
I thought I might tell you
something about Gortnacull

29:37.194 --> 29:38.627
that might be useful.

29:39.636 --> 29:41.024
Thank you, sir.

29:44.193 --> 29:45.625
I remember...

29:47.123 --> 29:49.847
... when I arrived
there, being struck by how

29:50.058 --> 29:51.739
grand-looking it was.

29:54.303 --> 29:57.161
Lovely gardens, outside pool,

29:57.749 --> 30:00.097
views over Belfast Lough.

30:01.107 --> 30:02.605
Apparently

30:02.966 --> 30:04.360
so much more than the boys

30:04.371 --> 30:06.352
would have been used
to at home in Belfast.

30:09.554 --> 30:11.407
Just off the entrance hall

30:12.123 --> 30:13.926
there was a large dining room.

30:16.796 --> 30:18.965
All the boys we interviewed

30:19.674 --> 30:23.143
told of how they were
taken there every day...

30:25.074 --> 30:26.794
... and made to masturbate

30:27.349 --> 30:29.474
to entertain the staff members.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.038
Masturbate themselves,

30:34.186 --> 30:36.477
masturbate members of staff.

30:40.517 --> 30:43.059
We did fluorescence tests on the carpet.

30:46.466 --> 30:48.336
It was covered in stains.

30:52.403 --> 30:54.396
David Alvarez was there

30:55.106 --> 30:57.365
at the same time as Paul Spector...

30:58.269 --> 30:59.874
as Peter Baldwin.

31:02.434 --> 31:04.184
He would know about that.

31:08.129 --> 31:10.114
He would remember that dining room.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.313
That... that was all.

31:23.810 --> 31:25.034
Just...

31:29.419 --> 31:30.823
That was all.

32:24.834 --> 32:27.134
I just took a call from the DPP, ma'am.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.994
It seems that Sean Healy
has lodged a complaint

32:30.006 --> 32:31.634
against you with the Police Ombudsman.

32:32.678 --> 32:33.674
I see.

32:33.674 --> 32:36.176
Also an abuse of process application.

32:39.252 --> 32:41.010
You'd better give me the details.

32:51.954 --> 32:54.434
This is my client, David Alvarez.

32:54.674 --> 32:57.477
David, this is Detective
Sergeant Tom Anderson

32:57.654 --> 32:59.702
and PC Dani Ferrington.

33:00.568 --> 33:02.571
Thanks very much for
talking to us, David.

33:04.036 --> 33:05.434
I haven't yet.

33:08.552 --> 33:10.239
You understand that it's in connection

33:10.255 --> 33:11.671
with your conviction for murder?

33:13.314 --> 33:15.014
Frazer's explained, yes.

33:15.249 --> 33:16.044
Good.

33:16.678 --> 33:19.001
I wonder, do you recognise this man?

33:19.201 --> 33:20.874
For the purposes of the tape,

33:20.994 --> 33:24.224
I'm showing David a picture
of a male individual.

33:27.443 --> 33:28.651
I do, yes.

33:29.143 --> 33:30.733
What name do you know him by?

33:33.143 --> 33:34.274
Peter Baldwin.

33:34.394 --> 33:35.841
How do you know Peter Baldwin?

33:38.748 --> 33:40.823
We were in Gortnacull House together.

33:41.084 --> 33:42.474
When was that?

33:43.834 --> 33:48.298
Ah, I was there from 1990 to 1994.

33:48.331 --> 33:50.511
- I'm a year younger than him.
- Right.

33:50.689 --> 33:53.794
And when was the last time
that you saw Peter Baldwin?

33:57.026 --> 33:58.594
In 2002.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.627
- Where was that?
- In London.

34:01.537 --> 34:03.551
And what were the
circumstances of that meeting?

34:03.573 --> 34:04.833
Was he there at your invitation?

34:04.844 --> 34:07.463
No, we met by chance. The
last time I'd seen him was

34:07.984 --> 34:09.926
at Gortnacull when I was 12.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.801
At Gortnacull with Father Jensen.

34:14.793 --> 34:18.195
Perhaps we can talk about
the period in your life

34:18.217 --> 34:20.531
before you were first incarcerated.

34:20.754 --> 34:23.793
When you compiled your
own map of Dundalk.

34:27.145 --> 34:28.688
What do you want to know?

34:29.842 --> 34:32.306
When did that behaviour begin for you?

34:33.560 --> 34:34.954
What behaviour?

34:35.003 --> 34:36.373
The voyeurism.

34:38.965 --> 34:40.373
Around that age.

34:40.580 --> 34:41.934
13 or so.

34:42.804 --> 34:45.123
What were you seeking, do you think,

34:45.136 --> 34:46.989
in behaving in that way?

34:48.434 --> 34:49.674
Relief.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.331
From?

34:53.674 --> 34:54.674
Boredom.

34:56.068 --> 34:57.274
Loneliness.

34:58.770 --> 35:00.868
It was exciting that they were...

35:01.711 --> 35:03.554
unsuspecting, unaware.

35:04.934 --> 35:08.120
Because of the possibility
of seeing someone naked,

35:08.780 --> 35:10.068
or disrobing,

35:10.394 --> 35:12.834
or engaging in sexual activity?

35:13.419 --> 35:15.755
No, not just that.

35:17.542 --> 35:18.794
Then what?

35:21.189 --> 35:22.754
Seeing into homes.

35:24.874 --> 35:26.334
Real homes.

35:27.327 --> 35:29.880
Comfortable, warm.

35:31.584 --> 35:32.988
A glimpse into

35:33.537 --> 35:35.274
lives being led.

35:36.245 --> 35:37.834
Full lives.

35:40.441 --> 35:42.793
I'd imagine myself in those homes,

35:43.398 --> 35:46.133
as part of those lives,
at the dinner table...

35:46.994 --> 35:49.607
watching television with the fire on.

35:50.767 --> 35:52.476
How did it make you feel,

35:52.692 --> 35:54.839
being on the outside looking in?

35:56.914 --> 35:58.274
Lonely.

35:59.839 --> 36:00.994
Angry?

36:03.301 --> 36:04.434
Yes.

36:06.126 --> 36:07.514
Aroused?

36:14.700 --> 36:16.714
When did you start breaking in?

36:24.432 --> 36:26.234
When I'd built up the courage.

36:27.922 --> 36:29.453
How did you do that?

36:30.662 --> 36:32.114
I'd get closer to them.

36:33.681 --> 36:34.994
How?

36:37.149 --> 36:38.594
I'd telephone them.

36:39.996 --> 36:42.049
Deliver their newspapers.

36:42.554 --> 36:44.619
Ride with them on the bus.

36:45.152 --> 36:46.623
Once, I even

36:47.072 --> 36:48.937
carried a woman's shopping home for her.

36:51.067 --> 36:54.234
Were the break-ins
spontaneous, or did you plan?

36:55.354 --> 36:57.083
I made extensive,

36:57.394 --> 36:58.981
elaborate plans.

37:02.555 --> 37:04.358
I discovered that it was easy.

37:05.718 --> 37:08.038
For the most part, people feel safe.

37:08.881 --> 37:11.012
They forget to turn the alarm on,

37:11.467 --> 37:13.998
leave windows open, patio doors.

37:15.607 --> 37:17.738
I didn't want anyone to feel safe.

37:19.354 --> 37:21.178
Why should they have that luxury?

37:22.434 --> 37:23.858
We just hung out.

37:24.063 --> 37:25.839
We drank, we took drugs.

37:25.959 --> 37:28.325
- What sort of drugs?
- Coke, mainly.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.674
Where was this?

37:32.314 --> 37:33.885
In Brixton.

37:34.714 --> 37:37.792
We shared a flat in Brixton,

37:37.912 --> 37:39.630
in Coldharbour Lane.

37:44.141 --> 37:46.128
Were you with Paul Spector...

37:46.904 --> 37:48.164
Peter Baldwin...

37:48.746 --> 37:51.599
on the night that Susan
Harper died, David?

37:55.815 --> 37:57.194
We think you were.

37:59.554 --> 38:01.442
I'm producing a laptop

38:01.447 --> 38:05.698
showing CCTV footage of Exhibit NS1.

38:09.554 --> 38:12.906
Taken from Edenvale Road, London, SW9,

38:12.922 --> 38:17.306
on Sunday the 18th of
August 2002 at 1:45am.

38:18.674 --> 38:20.315
We think that's Paul Spector,

38:20.315 --> 38:23.233
leaving the club with you and
Susan on the night that she died.

38:27.754 --> 38:30.036
So your interest in voyeurism

38:30.036 --> 38:31.740
gave way to a desire to

38:32.154 --> 38:34.454
break into the observed space?

38:34.898 --> 38:38.982
To violate those individuals
in a more intimate way?

38:40.954 --> 38:42.556
You're thinking that

38:43.216 --> 38:44.886
the voyeurism was a...

38:46.274 --> 38:48.316
... precursor to more

38:48.876 --> 38:50.802
aggressive sexual deviancies?

38:50.922 --> 38:55.508
No, I'm just trying to
understand the progression of your

38:55.936 --> 38:57.273
criminality.

39:02.911 --> 39:05.269
I thought I'd put it all behind me.

39:05.741 --> 39:08.742
When I married Sally
Ann. When Olivia was born.

39:09.686 --> 39:12.693
I thought that was all in the past,

39:13.370 --> 39:15.129
troubles of my youth.

39:16.172 --> 39:17.859
But now I'm being told that

39:18.802 --> 39:20.194
it was the opposite.

39:21.654 --> 39:24.474
Like an addict, I'd
gone from bad to worse.

39:27.852 --> 39:31.626
In my view, those distortions originate

39:31.698 --> 39:34.354
from a variety of places in childhood.

39:35.577 --> 39:37.696
Childhood victimization.

39:38.661 --> 39:41.253
Faulty family relationships.

39:42.552 --> 39:45.371
General psychological distress.

39:47.136 --> 39:49.154
They are not so easily dealt with.

39:50.642 --> 39:52.114
Not without help.

39:53.556 --> 39:56.513
They are not so easily cast aside.

40:01.601 --> 40:04.387
Did you confess because you
felt guilty about the offence?

40:06.371 --> 40:07.394
Maybe.

40:09.314 --> 40:10.394
Maybe, yes.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.074
Or to protect someone?

40:17.821 --> 40:20.365
You see, David, when I
look at this interview...

40:20.374 --> 40:24.008
like... I can see you've...

40:25.234 --> 40:28.554
... you've no idea how
the murder took place.

40:28.554 --> 40:30.342
You don't even know
if there was a murder.

40:31.207 --> 40:34.323
I can see that you were led
and prompted by the detectives

40:34.336 --> 40:36.462
in a shameful and unprofessional manner.

40:37.926 --> 40:39.813
It's time to tell the truth, David.

40:44.216 --> 40:46.257
I have here the transcript
of that interview,

40:46.274 --> 40:48.394
dated the 22nd of August 2002.

40:48.645 --> 40:52.074
Reese: "Why was there a
washing-up bowl by the bed, David?"

40:52.361 --> 40:53.359
"What?"

40:53.404 --> 40:54.953
"A plastic washing-up bowl."

40:55.450 --> 40:56.471
"I don't know."

40:56.506 --> 40:57.909
"What colour was that bowl?"

40:58.105 --> 40:59.034
"Blue?"

40:59.383 --> 41:01.914
"Were you cleaning up the
scene, washing your hands, what?"

41:01.914 --> 41:03.081
"I was stoned."

41:03.154 --> 41:04.817
"Oh, so now you were stoned?"

41:05.177 --> 41:06.327
"I'd been drinking."

41:06.873 --> 41:08.666
"So what colour was the bowl?"

41:09.465 --> 41:10.593
"Grey?

41:11.099 --> 41:12.196
Green?

41:12.524 --> 41:13.554
Brown?"

41:13.879 --> 41:15.512
"Green, David, yes."

41:25.980 --> 41:28.328
I think I know why that bowl was there.

41:31.102 --> 41:33.224
And it relates to the modus operandi of

41:33.233 --> 41:34.898
Paul Spector, Peter Baldwin.

41:39.514 --> 41:41.703
Are you sure he killed all those girls?

41:42.916 --> 41:44.194
Yes, we are.

41:46.072 --> 41:47.914
Why are you protecting him, David?

41:52.474 --> 41:55.373
No-one has any idea how
bad Gortnacull House was.

41:58.730 --> 42:00.274
Only those that were there.

42:03.223 --> 42:06.418
- I have some idea.
- No, you fucking don't.

42:06.801 --> 42:08.074
Then tell me.

42:09.914 --> 42:11.076
Tell me, David.

42:11.081 --> 42:13.168
Tell me about the dining room.

42:15.042 --> 42:16.707
Was there morning assemblies?

42:22.127 --> 42:23.618
How do you know about that?

42:24.839 --> 42:26.455
One of my colleagues

42:26.478 --> 42:28.350
was the arresting officer who put Jensen

42:28.350 --> 42:29.798
and several others in prison.

42:33.447 --> 42:35.572
And they did forensic tests there,

42:36.105 --> 42:38.564
and they found the carpet in that room

42:38.901 --> 42:41.223
covered in semen stains.

42:46.870 --> 42:47.754
David?

42:50.710 --> 42:52.419
Is that something that happened to you?

42:54.305 --> 42:57.084
Did you have to masturbate
in front of other boys, staff?

43:00.911 --> 43:01.839
Everyone did.

43:02.189 --> 43:04.609
- Peter Baldwin?
- I said, "Everyone did."

43:09.604 --> 43:11.554
Me, Pretty Boy...

43:14.585 --> 43:16.640
... everyone did, at
one time or another.

43:18.034 --> 43:19.184
Pretty Boy?

43:19.792 --> 43:20.920
Jensen's name.

43:20.977 --> 43:22.056
For Spector?

43:24.156 --> 43:26.495
For Baldwin, Spector, whatever.

43:31.148 --> 43:32.794
Jensen always had a favourite.

43:34.691 --> 43:36.782
A boy of about 12 or 13 years of age

43:36.795 --> 43:39.276
that he would single out
for his special attentions.

43:40.542 --> 43:42.433
And the tradition was
that when he was leaving,

43:42.434 --> 43:44.880
a special boy had to
nominate his successor.

43:49.022 --> 43:51.948
So Jensen and Baldwin came
to our dormitory one night.

43:55.282 --> 43:58.362
Peter was due to leave, and
Jensen made Peter choose.

44:05.306 --> 44:07.034
He could have chose me.

44:09.976 --> 44:11.569
He looked straight at me.

44:11.689 --> 44:12.755
Straight at me.

44:13.754 --> 44:15.383
Jensen looked straight at me.

44:16.732 --> 44:18.508
And I knew Jensen wanted me.

44:18.996 --> 44:20.128
I felt it.

44:24.364 --> 44:27.165
But Peter walked straight
past me and chose another boy.

44:28.471 --> 44:30.433
I don't know who, some poor fuck.

44:30.553 --> 44:32.440
I didn't look, I didn't even care.

44:33.554 --> 44:35.365
Just as long as it wasn't me.

44:36.209 --> 44:37.958
Just as long as it wasn't me.

44:42.926 --> 44:45.523
Being Jensen's favourite
was the worst thing...

44:47.121 --> 44:48.905
the worst thing you can imagine.

44:52.771 --> 44:53.917
David...

44:57.566 --> 45:00.429
... are you certain that
Baldwin, Paul Spector,

45:00.865 --> 45:02.354
was Jensen's favourite?

45:05.895 --> 45:07.154
For a full year.

45:10.747 --> 45:12.994
Every night and every
day for a full year.

45:22.041 --> 45:24.651
Do you know why your
mother took her own life?

45:28.114 --> 45:29.406
Hmm...

45:29.754 --> 45:32.038
Because my love wasn't enough for her,

45:32.935 --> 45:34.111
enough to...

45:35.536 --> 45:36.908
keep her alive.

45:40.473 --> 45:42.933
Whenever I was ill, as a child...

45:45.352 --> 45:47.935
... she'd take me into
her bed and care for me.

45:49.315 --> 45:51.274
And Baldwin would sleep in mine.

45:53.008 --> 45:54.841
And when he left, she was...

45:56.368 --> 45:59.494
... so sad that I slept in
there with her, every night.

46:02.748 --> 46:04.253
Just me and her

46:04.582 --> 46:05.705
in the world.

46:08.036 --> 46:09.398
The car lights would

46:09.669 --> 46:11.298
sweep across the ceiling...

46:13.114 --> 46:14.594
... and I'd imagine that...

46:16.376 --> 46:19.363
... we were on a raft
together drifting in the water.

46:22.209 --> 46:23.878
Just me and her

46:24.393 --> 46:26.169
in the world but we had each other.

46:29.804 --> 46:31.337
I still remember her smell,

46:32.184 --> 46:33.685
the smell of her clothes.

46:39.231 --> 46:41.201
On my eighth birthday...

46:43.003 --> 46:44.314
... after he'd left...

46:46.114 --> 46:47.220
she told me that...

46:48.276 --> 46:49.621
he wasn't my father.

46:51.814 --> 46:53.594
That my real father...

46:55.614 --> 46:56.954
... unreal father...

46:58.739 --> 47:00.412
... was a British soldier who

47:00.701 --> 47:02.987
- was gone before I was born.
- Hm.

47:05.918 --> 47:07.090
That was her...

47:08.275 --> 47:09.762
birthday gift to me.

47:12.648 --> 47:14.420
Ten days later, she was dead.

47:18.420 --> 47:20.234
Were you the one to find her?

47:26.428 --> 47:27.834
It was a school day.

47:31.170 --> 47:33.163
She wasn't there at
the gate to pick me up,

47:33.571 --> 47:34.992
so I walked home.

47:36.074 --> 47:37.571
Rang the doorbell,

47:38.868 --> 47:40.133
there was no answer.

47:42.099 --> 47:44.008
But there was a key under the mat, so...

47:45.633 --> 47:46.943
... so I let myself in.

47:50.374 --> 47:52.945
I shouted out, there was no reply.

47:53.398 --> 47:54.840
The radio was on.

47:57.952 --> 47:59.154
I looked around.

48:00.993 --> 48:02.378
I went upstairs...

48:04.575 --> 48:06.422
... pushed against her bedroom.

48:07.256 --> 48:08.117
There was a...

48:08.512 --> 48:10.514
thump against the door.

48:12.979 --> 48:15.114
So I pushed more until I got in.

48:17.521 --> 48:18.498
And...

48:19.084 --> 48:20.740
she was on the back of the door...

48:24.056 --> 48:25.760
... belts around her neck.

48:29.457 --> 48:31.882
I shouted at her, but
there was no response.

48:35.616 --> 48:37.493
I didn't know if she was dead or alive.

48:38.678 --> 48:40.311
I called 999.

48:40.946 --> 48:42.300
The ambulance men came.

48:44.373 --> 48:45.443
They, erm...

48:46.633 --> 48:48.363
... they told me to wait in my room.

48:50.867 --> 48:52.394
I looked out the window and...

48:53.771 --> 48:56.479
... I remember this red
blanket that they used

48:56.519 --> 48:58.099
cover her when they wheeled her out.

49:00.630 --> 49:02.139
All that day, people

49:03.063 --> 49:04.417
came and went and

49:05.584 --> 49:07.525
nobody told me what had happened.

49:09.354 --> 49:10.849
Then later someone said that

49:11.848 --> 49:13.770
she'd "gone to a better place."

49:17.423 --> 49:19.474
I suppose I knew she was dead but...

49:20.504 --> 49:23.021
there was a part of me that
thought maybe she was alive...

49:24.931 --> 49:26.354
... living elsewhere...

49:27.594 --> 49:30.592
... in a better place
because I wasn't there.

49:33.255 --> 49:35.901
The last memory I have
of her, she was very

49:36.371 --> 49:38.502
angry with me, angry for

49:39.239 --> 49:40.589
something I'd done.

49:40.979 --> 49:41.973
I don't know what.

49:46.431 --> 49:50.045
You know you worked on a
suicide helpline for some years?

49:52.548 --> 49:53.594
No.

49:55.474 --> 49:56.699
You did.

49:58.356 --> 50:01.194
And, of course, as a
bereavement counsellor.

50:02.905 --> 50:06.074
Why were you drawn to that
line of work, do you think?

50:11.397 --> 50:13.581
Something morbid in me, I suppose.

50:17.532 --> 50:19.154
After my mother died...

50:21.585 --> 50:23.116
... I had this...

50:23.645 --> 50:24.963
recurring dream.

50:25.793 --> 50:27.396
I was lying in a coffin...

50:29.545 --> 50:31.194
... and I was cut up into...

50:34.028 --> 50:35.586
... small chunks.

50:38.672 --> 50:41.274
But there was a nerve that
ran through every piece

50:42.122 --> 50:43.894
that was connected to my brain.

50:45.314 --> 50:46.344
Hm.

50:47.742 --> 50:49.754
That sounds very frightening.

50:52.404 --> 50:55.394
Why would he take the
blame, David Alvarez?

50:55.631 --> 50:57.474
Why would he do that for Spector?

50:57.746 --> 50:59.794
Beyond the debt of gratitude?

51:01.106 --> 51:02.656
It's clear he felt guilty.

51:02.776 --> 51:04.254
He was part of it, after all.

51:04.778 --> 51:06.802
He wrote long rambling
letters of apology

51:06.806 --> 51:08.653
to Susan Harper's parents from prison.

51:08.773 --> 51:11.161
In his interviews he
seems very vulnerable...

51:11.446 --> 51:12.795
and suggestible.

51:12.849 --> 51:14.882
I guess he's toughened up in prison, but

51:15.002 --> 51:18.825
I wonder if he didn't get off on it

51:18.825 --> 51:20.215
in some way at the time.

51:20.249 --> 51:21.913
He seemed very flattered
by the detectives

51:21.931 --> 51:23.409
"boys will be boys" bullshit.

51:23.676 --> 51:25.595
And, suddenly, he was
the centre of attention,

51:25.715 --> 51:27.632
a kind of celebrity.

51:27.914 --> 51:28.752
Oh.

51:29.156 --> 51:30.767
Have you spoken to Chris George?

51:31.509 --> 51:33.574
Is he going to want a
Met officer to sit in

51:33.587 --> 51:35.954
on any further interviews
regarding the Harper murder?

51:36.037 --> 51:37.760
He's happy for you to represent the Met,

51:37.960 --> 51:39.527
and he said he'll back us

51:39.549 --> 51:41.547
if we reopen the Alvarez investigation.

51:42.208 --> 51:43.669
That's great news.

51:44.535 --> 51:46.861
We're seeing Spector tomorrow
to put the new evidence

51:46.870 --> 51:48.099
from the lock-up to him.

51:48.219 --> 51:49.315
When are you back?

51:49.354 --> 51:50.328
First thing.

51:50.448 --> 51:52.264
I'll go straight to
the Serious Crime Suite.

51:52.308 --> 51:53.484
Good work, Tom.

51:53.994 --> 51:54.984
Let's hope so.

53:11.893 --> 53:13.704
Detective Superintendent Gibson.

54:02.479 --> 54:05.834
This interview is being recorded
at the Down Serious Crime Suite.

54:05.908 --> 54:08.448
The date is the 16th of May 2012

54:08.457 --> 54:11.594
and the time, by my watch, is 1400.

54:11.819 --> 54:13.403
I'm Detective Sergeant Anderson,

54:13.456 --> 54:16.835
and the other police officer present
is Detective Superintendent Gibson.

54:16.955 --> 54:19.114
Can you please state your
full name and date of birth?

54:19.321 --> 54:20.715
Peter Paul Spector,

54:20.941 --> 54:22.992
25th of May 1979.

54:23.804 --> 54:26.792
- And also present is?
- Sean Healy, solicitor.

54:27.675 --> 54:29.842
And at the conclusion of
the interview I'll give

54:30.033 --> 54:32.303
a notice of how you can
obtain a copy of the tapes.

54:33.024 --> 54:34.316
You do not have to say anything,

54:34.345 --> 54:36.738
but I must caution you if you
do not mention when questioned

54:36.752 --> 54:38.226
something you later rely on in court,

54:38.233 --> 54:39.437
it may harm your defence.

54:39.849 --> 54:42.262
If you do say anything, it
may be given in evidence.

54:42.617 --> 54:44.066
Do you understand the caution?

54:44.439 --> 54:45.519
Yes.

54:46.638 --> 54:48.565
We have reason to
believe that you rented

54:48.572 --> 54:50.468
a lock-up as a storage unit

54:50.677 --> 54:53.114
in the name of Peter Baldwin.

54:53.487 --> 54:55.529
I'm showing a lease agreement

54:55.911 --> 54:57.003
for that lock-up.

55:02.935 --> 55:04.626
Is that your signature on the document?

55:10.047 --> 55:11.295
For the benefit of the tape,

55:11.317 --> 55:13.554
Paul Spector has declined
to answer the question.

55:13.866 --> 55:14.953
So, in that lock-up,

55:15.366 --> 55:17.017
along with a car we believe you stole,

55:17.039 --> 55:18.237
we found a number of items

55:18.357 --> 55:19.800
that we'd like you to account for.

55:19.831 --> 55:21.842
Now, we believe that these...

55:22.179 --> 55:25.775
documents, these diaries
or journals, are your work.

55:25.794 --> 55:28.477
I'm showing exhibit ME369,

55:28.704 --> 55:31.261
which is a journal, and also

55:31.926 --> 55:34.430
a copy of the contents of the journal.

55:35.594 --> 55:36.646
Now...

55:37.316 --> 55:40.211
are you able to identify
the subject of this journal,

55:40.233 --> 55:43.322
a woman with the initials RW?

55:48.914 --> 55:50.895
- No.
- This is pointless.

55:51.374 --> 55:53.612
My client is undergoing assessment

55:53.625 --> 55:55.654
because he is suffering
retrograde amnesia

55:55.662 --> 55:58.034
which covers all autobiographical memory

55:58.114 --> 56:00.391
for a period of six years or so.

56:01.554 --> 56:03.794
Then perhaps you recognise this man?

56:04.005 --> 56:06.740
I'm showing a photograph
of a male person.

56:06.913 --> 56:08.120
What's this?

56:08.373 --> 56:11.245
We believe he was with you
in Gortnacull Children's Home

56:11.263 --> 56:14.641
and that you met him again in 2002,

56:14.983 --> 56:15.977
in London,

56:16.718 --> 56:19.305
which is a period that
falls outside the timeframe

56:19.314 --> 56:20.943
of your purported amnesia.

56:21.005 --> 56:23.314
What has this got to do with
the contents of the lock-up?

56:23.381 --> 56:25.364
Before my client answers...

56:26.354 --> 56:28.707
... could you please explain
the relevance of this photograph?

56:29.218 --> 56:32.667
This man is, at present, serving
a life sentence for a murder,

56:32.676 --> 56:34.465
a murder he committed in 2002.

56:34.487 --> 56:35.473
Even then, I'm sorry,

56:35.482 --> 56:37.489
but it falls outside the
scope of this interview.

56:37.528 --> 56:38.665
The murder of this woman.

56:38.674 --> 56:40.930
I'm showing a photograph
of the female victim.

56:44.865 --> 56:49.757
DCI Eastwood has just
entered the room at 14:03.

56:51.314 --> 56:52.464
Paul Spector,

56:53.432 --> 56:55.629
I am further arresting you

56:55.678 --> 56:57.604
for the murder of Susan Harper

56:57.834 --> 57:00.201
at Flat 16 Thornton Rise,

57:00.214 --> 57:05.142
SW16 3CV, on the 18th
of the eighth, 2002.

57:05.825 --> 57:07.903
I must remind you that you
are still under caution.

57:07.934 --> 57:10.003
I insist this interview be suspended.

57:10.017 --> 57:11.527
I must take instruction from Mr Spector.

57:11.562 --> 57:13.314
Do you recognise this
man? Do you know his name?

57:13.314 --> 57:16.076
- David Alvarez.
- This interview stops now.

57:17.968 --> 57:20.188
Interview has been suspended at 14:04

57:20.205 --> 57:22.860
so that Paul Spector can
consult with his solicitor.

57:37.674 --> 57:39.872
Who the fuck is David Alvarez?

57:41.151 --> 57:42.860
Just as they've said,

57:43.632 --> 57:45.190
someone I knew when I was a child

57:45.208 --> 57:47.383
and then again in London in 2002.

57:47.503 --> 57:48.959
A convicted murderer?

57:49.328 --> 57:50.802
Yes.

57:50.837 --> 57:52.143
What is going on?

57:57.421 --> 57:58.994
The police have been clever.

58:01.625 --> 58:02.650
They have something on me

58:02.663 --> 58:04.283
that I can actually remember.
