to the man on the phone.

All right, when they hear
the voice of one of my guys,

31:20.430 --> 31:22.197
they're gonna know
the difference.

31:22.199 --> 31:23.531
How so, Chief?

31:23.533 --> 31:25.233
You want me
to spell it out for you?

31:25.235 --> 31:28.236
They're going to know
the difference

31:28.238 --> 31:31.874
between how a white man talks
and a Negro.

31:31.876 --> 31:33.708

does a black man talk?

31:33.710 --> 31:35.276
TRAPP:
Okay, Ron, what I think

31:35.278 --> 31:36.912
the chief is trying to say...

31:36.914 --> 31:38.647
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak for myself.

31:38.649 --> 31:39.714
- Thank you, Sarge.
- Sure.

31:39.716 --> 31:41.316
You know what
I'm trying to say.

31:41.318 --> 31:43.385
Chief, some of us can speak
King's English.

31:43.387 --> 31:44.887
Others speak jive.

31:44.889 --> 31:47.823
Ron Stallworth here
happens to be fluent in both.

31:47.825 --> 31:49.724
(SIGHS)

31:49.726 --> 31:53.728
Okay, Ron, how do you propose
to make this investigation?

31:53.730 --> 31:56.899
Well, I've established contact
and created some familiarity

31:56.901 --> 31:58.834
with the Klansman
over the phone.

31:58.836 --> 32:01.236
I'll continue in that role,
but I'll need another officer...

32:01.238 --> 32:03.471
surprise, surprise,
a white officer...

32:03.473 --> 32:05.507
to play me
when they meet face-to-face.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.542
See, that's my point exactly.

32:07.544 --> 32:09.644
Chief, black Ron Stallworth
over the phone,

32:09.646 --> 32:10.980
white Ron Stallworth
face-to-face,

32:10.982 --> 32:14.315
so there becomes
a combined Ron Stallworth.

32:14.317 --> 32:16.418
- Can you do that?
- I believe we can.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.355
With the right white man,
we can do anything.

32:19.723 --> 32:22.524
Anything happens
to one of my men,

Well, then you come
to the right place.

41:07.785 --> 41:09.284
Nobody fucks with us.

41:09.286 --> 41:12.056
Now, how much you know
about the history?

41:13.157 --> 41:14.890
Some. I could know more.

41:14.892 --> 41:16.225
We will teach you.

41:16.227 --> 41:19.061
Yeah, this is fixing
to be a big year for us.

41:19.063 --> 41:20.864
How so?

41:26.170 --> 41:27.836
- Boom!
- (CHUCKLING): All right.

41:27.838 --> 41:28.971
We're gonna make fireworks,
aren't we?

41:28.973 --> 41:30.906
All right, all right, Ivanhoe,
shut your dumb mouth.

41:30.908 --> 41:32.841
Ivan, shut the fuck up.

41:32.843 --> 41:34.343
- Burnt ends.
- All right, all right.

41:34.345 --> 41:36.278
That's enough.
Shut your dumb mouth.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.013
Sorry about him.
He drinks too much.

41:38.015 --> 41:39.848
(CHUCKLING):
Doesn't know what he's saying.

41:39.850 --> 41:41.917
Just to be clear, the, uh...

41:41.919 --> 41:44.019
the Organization
is strictly nonviolent.

41:44.021 --> 41:46.488
Oh, nonviolent
like that nigger,

41:46.490 --> 41:48.523

Martin Luther Coon.

41:48.525 --> 41:49.891
Yeah, gotcha.

41:49.893 --> 41:52.227
Ron? You mind coming with me?

41:52.229 --> 41:53.495
Yeah, where to?

41:53.497 --> 41:55.199
You undercover or something?

41:56.934 --> 41:58.894
- You ask too many questions.
- WALTER: All right.

41:59.937 --> 42:01.370
Be friendly, now.

42:01.372 --> 42:04.106

42:04.108 --> 42:05.974
Let's go.

42:05.976 --> 42:08.944
Congrats.
You passed the mustard.

42:08.946 --> 42:11.847
How about we go and get that
membership process started?

42:11.849 --> 42:13.949
- That's it?
- That's it.

42:13.951 --> 42:15.350
Uh, have a seat.

42:15.352 --> 42:17.986
Go ahead and, uh,
fill these out.

42:17.988 --> 42:19.354
Send 'em to the national
headquarters.

42:19.356 --> 42:21.857
Now, once they send you
your membership card,

42:21.859 --> 42:25.327
you'll be able to participate
in all our programs.

$15 chapter fee.

Robes and hoods
are not included.

42:34.638 --> 42:35.937
That's extra.

you brothers enough.

43:02.366 --> 43:03.632

43:03.634 --> 43:05.200
- Who you fucking?
- Double D!

43:05.202 --> 43:07.235
All right, both of you,
give the man some space.

Let him breathe a little.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.038
Ron, let me buy you a beer.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.039
- Okay.
- Come on.

43:11.041 --> 43:13.108
Sorry about these guys.
They're a little, uh,

43:13.110 --> 43:15.110
too friendly sometimes.

43:15.112 --> 43:16.545
They just get excited.

43:21.585 --> 43:24.953

43:24.955 --> 43:28.457
Not exactly
the Beverly Hillbillies.

43:28.459 --> 43:29.991
They liked you.

43:29.993 --> 43:32.294
Except for that Felix guy.

43:32.296 --> 43:34.429
Do not ride his bumper
like that.

43:35.933 --> 43:37.666
You think he got
a good look at my face?

43:37.668 --> 43:39.301
Probably.

43:39.303 --> 43:41.372
You get the papers?

43:42.973 --> 43:44.506
(LAUGHING):
They want you to join.

43:44.508 --> 43:46.141
Uh, technically,
they want you to join.

43:46.143 --> 43:47.709
Yeah.

43:47.711 --> 43:50.312
Yeah, they want a black man
to join the Ku Klux Klan.

43:50.314 --> 43:51.680
I'd say that's
mission impossible.

43:51.682 --> 43:53.415
- Double success.

Slow down.

43:56.954 --> 44:00.522
And exactly how much should we
be worried about them?

44:00.524 --> 44:02.357
Enough that we'd like
to dig deeper.

44:02.359 --> 44:05.127
One of the men discussed plans
for a possible attack, so...

44:05.129 --> 44:07.596
I wouldn't give him
that much credit.

44:07.598 --> 44:09.164
These guys like to boast.

44:09.166 --> 44:10.165
What kind of attack?

44:10.167 --> 44:11.967
Uh, Ivan...

44:11.969 --> 44:14.536
Ivanhoe said "boom," mentioned
something about fireworks.

44:14.538 --> 44:15.971
But personally,
I didn't buy it.

44:15.973 --> 44:17.672
I-I doubt they're even capable.

44:17.674 --> 44:20.275
Either way, at this point,
we're looking for full support

44:20.277 --> 44:21.676
from the department
on this, Sarge.

44:21.678 --> 44:23.478
Let's move on
with the investigation.

44:23.480 --> 44:26.014
Let's try to find out if
they are capable of anything.

44:26.016 --> 44:27.649
Okay.

When we dropped Brother Kwame
off at the airport,

44:34.759 --> 44:37.692
he told me
that the Black Power movement

44:37.694 --> 44:40.195
needed strong sisters like me
to lead the fight

44:40.197 --> 44:41.997

44:41.999 --> 44:44.433
and the politicians and pigs
who perpetuate it.

with these groups.

- David Duke.

Current Grand Wizard
of the Klan.

But he's always in

47:30.300 --> 47:33.234
never seen in a hood
or robe in public,

47:33.236 --> 47:35.236

- New ideas.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.921

I'm planning to step down

01:16:45.923 --> 01:16:48.123

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:51.293
But I would like to make
a nomination.

01:16:51.295 --> 01:16:55.030
Mr. Ron Stallworth
for chapter president.

01:16:55.032 --> 01:16:56.198

Let me ask a question.

01:17:02.339 --> 01:17:04.172
Is there anybody here
who's willing

01:17:04.174 --> 01:17:06.074
to put their neck
on the line for Ron?

01:17:06.076 --> 01:17:07.442
I'll vouch for Ron.

01:17:07.444 --> 01:17:09.644
You know who else
vouches for Ron?

01:17:09.646 --> 01:17:10.645
Mr. Duke.

but I-I can't accept.

what you good men need

- Which one is it, Ron?

01:17:31.368 --> 01:17:33.368

01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:34.569

uh, "are."

01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:38.066

"Are."

Did you ever notice that?

01:18:42.706 --> 01:18:45.140

Thank you for teaching me
this lesson.

If you had not brought it
to my attention,

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.827
I wouldn't have noticed
the difference
