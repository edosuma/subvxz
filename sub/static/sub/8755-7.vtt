WEBVTT

00:10.280 --> 00:12.114
Somebody's bleeding in here.

00:12.216 --> 00:14.983
My back was burning,
and there was a bite mark

00:15.085 --> 00:16.718
on the small of my back.

00:16.804 --> 00:18.186
Oh, my god.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.689
They're hanging on to my [bleep] spine.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.824
He stabs her approximately 50 times.

00:22.926 --> 00:23.892
50 times?

00:23.994 --> 00:25.994
It's like

00:26.096 --> 00:28.764
I think people are gonna
end up getting hurt.

00:28.866 --> 00:32.033
Threatening, "I'm going to get you."

00:32.119 --> 00:34.870
That thing's nasty.

00:34.972 --> 00:37.439
There's a dark presence.

00:37.541 --> 00:39.574
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.643 --> 00:41.576
These things, they're freaking out.

00:41.678 --> 00:42.978
They're from hell.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.079
I see dead people.

00:44.181 --> 00:45.347
They were being hunted.

00:45.449 --> 00:47.115
I speak to dead people.

00:47.198 --> 00:48.998
They were setting people on fire,

00:49.100 --> 00:49.999
burning them alive.

00:50.101 --> 00:51.356
And they speak to me.

00:51.456 --> 00:52.655
Her neck got broken.

00:52.757 --> 00:55.625
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.727 --> 00:57.627
I hear a gunshot.

00:57.729 --> 00:59.195
I rely on my partner.

00:59.297 --> 01:00.813
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.932 --> 01:02.665
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:02.767 --> 01:03.849
Something's not right here.

01:03.935 --> 01:07.236
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.338 --> 01:08.404
It's not safe here.

01:08.506 --> 01:09.472
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.607 --> 01:11.073
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:11.175 --> 01:12.208
They're all buried here.

01:12.310 --> 01:14.393
But Steve and I never speak...

01:14.493 --> 01:16.426
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:16.528 --> 01:17.828
Until the very end...

01:17.930 --> 01:19.096
I can't do it no more.

01:19.231 --> 01:21.164
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.266 --> 01:23.033
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:23.135 --> 01:24.484
Or time to get out.

01:24.603 --> 01:25.969
It does not have a happy ending.

01:26.071 --> 01:28.271
Something kills people here.

01:41.382 --> 01:43.215
I'm up here in North Haven, Connecticut,

01:43.300 --> 01:45.801
right near Yale University.

01:45.886 --> 01:47.719
I got a call from a kid named Anthony.

01:47.855 --> 01:49.221
Now, he just got married

01:49.290 --> 01:52.508
and moved back into his parents'
house with his new husband.

01:52.626 --> 01:55.577
Once he did that, all hell broke loose.

01:55.663 --> 01:58.363
Now he thinks his entire
family's in trouble.

01:58.499 --> 02:01.700
He begged us to come
out here and investigate.

02:01.802 --> 02:06.471
Hopefully, Amy and I can
get to the bottom of this.

02:06.557 --> 02:07.706
Before Amy arrives,

02:07.808 --> 02:10.092
I clear the house of
any leading information,

02:10.211 --> 02:15.247
removing photographs and
covering personal items.

02:15.382 --> 02:18.517
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:27.528 --> 02:29.161
There's this older lady.

02:29.263 --> 02:31.396
She is kind of a leader.

02:31.498 --> 02:33.232
Interesting. Okay.

02:37.004 --> 02:40.589
She's not happy I'm
here, like, not at all.

02:40.674 --> 02:41.807
The old woman,

02:41.892 --> 02:46.912
and two dead elderly men are with her.

02:47.014 --> 02:49.715
She can manipulate them very easily.

02:49.817 --> 02:50.816
She's very physical.

02:50.951 --> 02:52.651
So are her little henchmen.

02:52.753 --> 02:54.987
Their intentions are not good.

03:01.962 --> 03:03.065
So, Anthony, I'm glad I'm here

03:03.165 --> 03:05.482
because you sounded really
desperate on the phone.

03:05.584 --> 03:06.766
Yeah, I'm living in hell.

03:06.885 --> 03:09.002
I'm terrified to come in this house.

03:09.087 --> 03:10.587
We need help.

03:10.689 --> 03:13.623
I can't do this where
I see my mom crying,

03:13.758 --> 03:18.528
and everyone is miserable, and...

03:18.613 --> 03:19.924
Okay. So who else is in the house?

03:20.024 --> 03:22.391
Here is actually my whole family.

03:22.510 --> 03:23.742
Okay. So who's who here?

03:23.844 --> 03:25.894
- This is my brother, Richard.
- Okay.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.696
- That's my mom.
- Okay.

03:27.782 --> 03:29.848
That's my dad. He's actually a cop.

03:29.951 --> 03:31.266
- Your father's a cop?
- Yeah.

03:31.352 --> 03:33.552
And that's my younger brother, Louie.

03:33.638 --> 03:35.988
- Okay.
- And then, that's me.

03:36.073 --> 03:37.439
Now, Anthony, you
mentioned that you think

03:37.558 --> 03:39.325
things got worse when
you and Carlos moved in.

03:39.410 --> 03:40.609
Yeah.

03:40.728 --> 03:42.811
Think that kind of caused
or triggered something?

03:42.897 --> 03:45.424
Seems like it, yeah. It
seems like it made it angry.

03:45.524 --> 03:47.724
Okay. So what kind of
things are we talking about?

03:47.809 --> 03:50.377
We're hearing noises, footsteps,

03:50.462 --> 03:53.029
and things are disappearing, moving.

03:53.115 --> 03:58.535
We're seeing apparitions,
physical attacks, and illnesses.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.903
What kind of illnesses we talking about?

04:00.005 --> 04:04.140
Headaches, blurred
vision, dizziness, nausea.

04:04.209 --> 04:05.625
And recently, I was
actually hospitalized

04:05.711 --> 04:06.927
with a heart condition.

04:07.012 --> 04:08.512
How old are you?

04:08.647 --> 04:09.863
22.

04:09.948 --> 04:11.364
So what was the heart condition about?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.350
I had a really bad chest pain,

04:13.435 --> 04:15.051
and when I was in the hospital,

04:15.137 --> 04:17.303
they couldn't figure out what it was.

04:17.422 --> 04:18.971
Are you doing any kind of
dope, any kind of drugs,

04:19.091 --> 04:20.307
anything like that?

04:20.392 --> 04:21.892
Don't [bleep] with me.
I'm serious about that.

04:21.976 --> 04:22.893
Never.

04:23.028 --> 04:25.011
Okay. Why don't you just move?

04:25.130 --> 04:27.047
This is my childhood home.
I would love to stay here.

04:27.165 --> 04:31.635
But whatever it is, is
ruining us as a family,

04:31.737 --> 04:33.970
and it's, like, tearing us apart,

04:34.056 --> 04:36.273
and we need help.

04:36.358 --> 04:40.293
I think people are gonna
end up getting hurt.

04:40.412 --> 04:42.646
Okay.

04:44.883 --> 04:47.117
Oh, no.

04:47.219 --> 04:51.321
I'm having a heart issue in here.

04:51.406 --> 04:53.857
I think that there's a living male

04:53.992 --> 04:56.309
who's having heart problems.

04:56.428 --> 05:02.032
The elderly group of people
is influencing this person

05:02.134 --> 05:03.700
because they're vulnerable.

05:03.802 --> 05:06.102
He already has medical issues,

05:06.238 --> 05:08.471
and they're taking advantage of that.

05:08.557 --> 05:11.541
It's kind of scary because
they could cause this person

05:11.677 --> 05:13.810
to have a heart attack and die.

05:13.912 --> 05:16.346
They try to get him when he's alone.

05:26.425 --> 05:27.490
Ugh, okay.
I'm...

05:27.559 --> 05:31.077
I'm feeling it a little bit.

05:31.196 --> 05:32.729
He gets panicked and freaked out.

05:32.814 --> 05:35.732
I don't know why they're
trying to kill him.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.306
All right. So what's going on?

05:43.408 --> 05:44.941
I call it the top hat man.

05:45.043 --> 05:47.410
It's just pure black.

05:47.496 --> 05:49.613
It's, like, a silhouette of a man...

05:49.715 --> 05:51.147
- Okay.
- with a top hat.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.515
Any kind of features?

05:52.618 --> 05:53.717
- No.
- Okay.

05:53.852 --> 05:54.868
It's just solid black.

05:54.953 --> 05:56.753
Okay. And you saw that in which bedroom?

05:56.838 --> 05:57.821
- In my bedroom.
- In this one?

05:57.923 --> 05:59.723
Yes.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.825
Just standing there.

06:01.927 --> 06:03.326
Now, is anything else going on?

06:03.412 --> 06:06.896
We've seen blood, actual,
physical blood within the house.

06:07.032 --> 06:08.999
- Where?
- In this hallway,

06:09.101 --> 06:10.483
in the bathroom,

06:10.569 --> 06:13.136
down the stairs and right in
front of the basement door.

06:13.205 --> 06:14.671
All right. So let me get this straight.

06:14.756 --> 06:15.872
We're talking about actual what
you think is physical blood?

06:15.957 --> 06:17.007
Yes.

06:17.092 --> 06:18.623
Now, you got a red
light in the bathroom.

06:18.723 --> 06:19.104
Yes.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.303
You sure it couldn't have been water

06:20.405 --> 06:21.671
that looked like blood
because of the light?

06:21.773 --> 06:22.672
Nope.

06:22.774 --> 06:24.008
You guys have any pets at that time?

06:24.108 --> 06:25.240
We did. We had a dog.

06:25.326 --> 06:28.198
My dad had checked the
whole dog, checked his paws,

06:28.298 --> 06:30.097
- checked everything.
- What did he think?

06:30.233 --> 06:33.167
He tried everything he could
to figure out what it was.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.453
I remember he got my mom's nail polish.

06:35.538 --> 06:36.954
He got her lipstick.

06:37.040 --> 06:42.059
And nothing could match
what was on the floor.

06:42.178 --> 06:43.427
This is some
off-the-wall stuff.

06:43.513 --> 06:44.495
Yeah.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.796
This blood thing's a first

06:45.882 --> 06:47.048
in all these investigations I've done.

06:47.183 --> 06:48.198
I've never heard anything like this.

06:48.298 --> 06:49.680
When I was growing up,
I had seen a lot of stuff

06:49.799 --> 06:51.265
in this house.

06:51.401 --> 06:53.634
But now, it's actually almost
like it's interacting with us,

06:53.720 --> 06:55.803
like, attacking people.

06:57.891 --> 07:02.243
Somebody's bleeding in here.

07:02.345 --> 07:06.681
I'm seeing hands and
blood, blood on the floor.

07:06.783 --> 07:09.951
How much? Where?

07:10.036 --> 07:12.487
Quite a bit.

07:12.589 --> 07:13.905
Definitely goes out the door.

07:14.023 --> 07:16.874
I don't know where it goes, though.

07:23.666 --> 07:24.899
So, Carlos, I understand you and Anthony

07:25.001 --> 07:26.148
moved in here a year ago.

07:26.248 --> 07:27.448
- Yes.
- And I understand

07:27.533 --> 07:29.199
that you've had experiences.

07:29.285 --> 07:31.485
Yes. We were downstairs,
and we were on the couch.

07:31.587 --> 07:33.654
And all the sudden, the
blanket that was on the couch,

07:33.756 --> 07:36.490
just, like, someone picked
it up and dropped it.

07:36.592 --> 07:37.808
Were you guys awake, or...?

07:37.893 --> 07:39.693
Yeah, we were awake.
We were watching TV.

07:39.779 --> 07:41.495
And nobody was in the house
playing games with you guys?

07:41.630 --> 07:43.831
No. We were alone downstairs.

07:43.916 --> 07:46.383
I can't even think what
the hell nonparanormal

07:46.469 --> 07:47.668
that would've caused that.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.169
Anything else like that happen?

07:49.271 --> 07:51.522
Yeah, there was a banging
at the end of the bed.

07:51.640 --> 07:52.740
So we're talking about one of these?

07:52.875 --> 07:54.041
Yeah.

07:54.126 --> 07:55.959
It woke me up.

07:56.045 --> 07:58.729
But I didn't open my
eyes 'cause I was scared

07:58.814 --> 08:00.347
- to see what was there.
- Okay.

08:00.449 --> 08:02.716
So that's happened several times.

08:02.802 --> 08:04.585
And this is when the two of
you guys were in bed together?

08:04.687 --> 08:05.703
Yes.

08:05.821 --> 08:09.023
I've had cases before where dead people

08:09.108 --> 08:10.774
may not approve of your lifestyle.

08:10.860 --> 08:14.344
We've thought of that.
Anthony's mom thinks it's me.

08:14.463 --> 08:16.063
- You?
- Yes.

08:16.165 --> 08:17.481
And why's she think that?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.683
Well, she says that when I
first started coming here,

08:19.769 --> 08:22.119
that's when the activity picked up.

08:22.238 --> 08:23.370
You ever think about just moving?

08:23.456 --> 08:25.739
No. Well, we know that
we love each other,

08:25.841 --> 08:29.043
and we're gonna be together, so
we're gonna fight this together.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.515
There's a living person getting shoved,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.717
but it's against the wall.

08:39.087 --> 08:40.988
Like, they're coming
out, and they're like...

08:41.090 --> 08:42.121
La, la-la-la-la!...

08:42.224 --> 08:43.756
And then just like, "Ow."

08:43.859 --> 08:44.892
Like, you know what I mean?

08:44.994 --> 08:46.844
And this is a male, yeah.

08:46.929 --> 08:48.479
I'm feeling a younger male.

08:48.564 --> 08:52.750
He's kind of metrosexual.

08:52.868 --> 08:56.203
The person being shoved into the walls

08:56.305 --> 09:02.709
is due to the elderly
woman and her henchmen.

09:08.617 --> 09:12.886
I don't know why these
dead people are doing this.

09:12.988 --> 09:15.656
It's causing, like, a breakdown.

09:15.741 --> 09:17.558
It's really horrible.

09:38.359 --> 09:39.752
So, Terry, I
was talking to Anthony.

09:39.852 --> 09:42.352
He thinks that when he
moved in here with Carlos,

09:42.454 --> 09:43.904
that things kind of amped up.

09:44.023 --> 09:45.455
I agree.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.040
Do you think it has to
do with their lifestyle,

09:47.126 --> 09:49.459
or do you think it's because
Carlos is new to the house?

09:49.545 --> 09:52.029
I'm not sure if it's because they're gay

09:52.114 --> 09:54.948
or if it's because we
brought someone new in

09:55.034 --> 09:57.100
and whatever is here didn't want it.

09:57.169 --> 09:59.419
I mean, how did you, if
you don't mind me asking,

09:59.505 --> 10:02.172
take the news that
Anthony was... was gay?

10:02.274 --> 10:04.007
Um, not very well.

10:04.093 --> 10:06.510
It took a while to get through that.

10:06.595 --> 10:08.378
And I struggled with
the fact that I felt

10:08.514 --> 10:10.981
that I was never gonna have
grandchildren or anything.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.282
So, Terry, let's get to you.

10:12.368 --> 10:13.934
What about your
experiences? What's going on?

10:14.053 --> 10:16.703
I've been touched in my sleep.

10:16.789 --> 10:18.221
Okay. In what manner?

10:18.357 --> 10:20.424
Just a push on my shoulder.

10:20.526 --> 10:24.044
First, I thought I was dreaming,
but you know how you come to,

10:24.129 --> 10:25.729
and you realize you're not dreaming?

10:25.814 --> 10:27.297
It terrified me so bad.

10:27.399 --> 10:28.815
My husband was working overnight.

10:28.901 --> 10:30.000
So I called him home,

10:30.102 --> 10:32.069
had him come home and stay with me.

10:32.154 --> 10:33.270
So what else is going on?

10:33.355 --> 10:35.305
I have a really difficult time sleeping.

10:35.391 --> 10:37.808
I have a lot of nightmares.

10:37.893 --> 10:40.510
I wake up terrified,
and I don't know why.

10:40.646 --> 10:43.914
You can't sleep. It's scary to sleep.

10:49.221 --> 10:52.522
Whoa. There's a lot of anxiety up here.

10:52.624 --> 10:55.058
Lots of fear in living people here.

10:55.144 --> 10:56.393
They can't sleep.

10:56.528 --> 10:57.994
They can't eat.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.447
This is really bad. Okay.

11:00.566 --> 11:02.032
The three elderly people

11:02.117 --> 11:05.635
are doing this to the
living people here.

11:05.738 --> 11:09.039
I do feel like a female is
definitely perceiving this.

11:10.876 --> 11:13.994
Not sleeping, I think,
is making them worse.

11:14.079 --> 11:19.649
Like, they're really falling
into a horrible depression.

11:19.785 --> 11:23.687
And it's, like, really nearing,
like, a mental breakdown

11:23.789 --> 11:25.088
because of all of this.

11:25.190 --> 11:29.760
These dead people are totally
taking advantage of that.

11:29.862 --> 11:31.595
Oh, my God.

11:36.335 --> 11:37.601
Okay, so what else is going on?

11:37.703 --> 11:40.854
One night, the whole family was
playing a game in the kitchen,

11:40.973 --> 11:42.556
and we had a water bottle

11:42.641 --> 11:45.142
that went from the kitchen
into the living room.

11:45.227 --> 11:46.543
So where was the bottle?

11:46.628 --> 11:48.161
The bottle was on the floor.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.746
Well, you got a water
bottle here. Can I use this?

11:49.832 --> 11:51.531
Certainly.

11:54.019 --> 11:56.853
As if somebody kicked it,

11:56.939 --> 11:58.355
and it just rolled right
into the living room?

11:58.457 --> 12:00.290
Right. Right into the living room.

12:00.426 --> 12:03.677
Whether that's
paranormal or not, I...

12:03.796 --> 12:05.228
I don't know.

12:05.330 --> 12:06.930
All right. What else
is going on down here?

12:07.015 --> 12:09.116
That same night, when
we were playing the game,

12:09.234 --> 12:12.669
the light was swaying back and forth.

12:12.805 --> 12:13.787
This chandelier here?

12:13.872 --> 12:17.457
Yes.

12:17.576 --> 12:20.477
All right. So this is not stiff. So...

12:20.579 --> 12:21.945
- Right.
- Anybody hit it?

12:22.030 --> 12:23.613
- Nobody hit it.
- Was the door open?

12:23.715 --> 12:25.198
- Was there any wind?
- No.

12:25.317 --> 12:26.583
Was anything else going on in here?

12:26.718 --> 12:28.952
One morning, when everybody
was getting around for work,

12:29.037 --> 12:32.255
they came down, and every
cabinet in here was wide open.

12:32.357 --> 12:34.224
These aren't easy to open.

12:34.326 --> 12:36.960
Right. They were all open.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.512
Nobody playing jokes?

12:38.630 --> 12:41.615
Everybody denies that they
had anything to do with it.

12:46.605 --> 12:49.923
I'm seeing lots of stuff
happening in the kitchen,

12:50.008 --> 12:51.508
physical phenomena.

12:51.577 --> 12:54.311
I'm seeing, like,
these chairs...

12:54.413 --> 12:57.147
They're all nice like this.

12:57.232 --> 12:59.783
Person turns, turns around.

12:59.885 --> 13:02.202
They're all pulled out, all pulled out.

13:02.287 --> 13:05.722
And then, these are open.

13:05.824 --> 13:07.741
Lots of stuff happening in the kitchen,

13:07.860 --> 13:11.878
like, movement of objects.

13:11.964 --> 13:13.263
I already know why.

13:13.365 --> 13:16.967
Person here has P.K. abilities.

13:17.069 --> 13:18.301
Do you see the person?

13:18.403 --> 13:20.303
Female, shorter than me.

13:20.405 --> 13:22.706
She's, like...

13:22.791 --> 13:24.174
maybe, like, 45.

13:24.259 --> 13:26.009
She's got brown hair.

13:26.094 --> 13:29.813
The P.K. manifestation,
it's, like, grumbling

13:29.915 --> 13:33.133
and, like, hissing.

13:33.218 --> 13:38.772
That is a pretty intense personality.

13:38.891 --> 13:40.056
Gets yelling.

13:40.158 --> 13:41.258
How large is it?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.626
Well, right now, it's not so big

13:42.728 --> 13:45.295
because it made itself smaller.

13:45.397 --> 13:49.499
It looks like an inkblot with arms.

13:49.601 --> 13:52.193
And half human?

13:52.263 --> 13:55.147
It can make, like, a
head with eyes and mouth,

13:55.249 --> 13:56.432
but that's it.

13:56.551 --> 14:01.554
It's, like, saying really
negative, bad words to me.

14:01.639 --> 14:03.222
That thing's nasty.

14:10.164 --> 14:12.331
I understand you're
Richard's girlfriend.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.549
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:13.668 --> 14:15.217
And you've spent a lot of time here?

14:15.336 --> 14:16.569
No.

14:16.654 --> 14:17.737
Okay, why not?

14:17.839 --> 14:20.473
I was sleeping one night,
and I felt like someone

14:20.575 --> 14:22.691
was holding the blankets over my head.

14:22.810 --> 14:25.845
I just panicked. I was trying
to move. I couldn't move.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.847
I fought it, and I got
out of the blankets.

14:27.982 --> 14:29.999
I was sweating. I was crying.

14:30.118 --> 14:32.618
Okay. I can see now
you're upset about it.

14:32.754 --> 14:34.336
You sure this wasn't a nightmare?

14:34.455 --> 14:36.355
No, definitely not a nightmare.

14:36.441 --> 14:37.873
I could see the light from the TV.

14:37.992 --> 14:40.926
I could hear Anthony and Carlos
in the other room, talking.

14:41.012 --> 14:42.094
Is anything else going on in here?

14:42.230 --> 14:43.763
I was sleeping one night.

14:43.898 --> 14:45.431
It was about 3:00 in the morning.

14:45.516 --> 14:48.467
And I could see a shadow figure.

14:48.553 --> 14:49.835
I was just terrified.

14:49.921 --> 14:51.871
Can you describe that
shadow figure for me at all?

14:51.956 --> 14:54.790
It was almost like a shadow creature.

14:54.909 --> 14:57.660
Like, its arms were bent
back. Its legs were bent back.

14:57.745 --> 14:58.744
Okay.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.614
Had no eyes, just holes.

15:01.699 --> 15:03.682
How big was this thing?

15:03.751 --> 15:05.084
Size of a pillow.

15:05.186 --> 15:06.786
- Oh, small?
- Yeah.

15:06.888 --> 15:07.987
I was so shaken up.

15:08.089 --> 15:11.040
When we finally got
up, my back was burning.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.759
And I went home,
and there was a...

15:13.845 --> 15:16.061
a bite mark on the small of my back.

15:16.147 --> 15:17.763
Now, do you think that whatever's here

15:17.899 --> 15:20.199
is trying to drive you out
so you're not here anymore?

15:20.284 --> 15:21.400
Yeah.

15:21.536 --> 15:22.952
Every time I'm here,
I just get a feeling

15:23.070 --> 15:24.804
that I shouldn't be here.

15:28.276 --> 15:29.909
Okay, whoever created this thing

15:29.994 --> 15:33.479
has a [bleep] problem with
the person in this room.

15:33.581 --> 15:34.880
Why do you say that?

15:34.982 --> 15:37.233
I feel like it's trying
to bite or scratch.

15:40.021 --> 15:41.153
Burning, scratching,

15:41.289 --> 15:42.888
hitting, pulling hair,
that kind of thing.

15:42.990 --> 15:45.024
Making this person sick.

15:45.109 --> 15:48.427
It's threatening,
threatening this person,

15:48.529 --> 15:50.396
"I'm going to get you."

16:04.033 --> 16:05.857
Look, I always
play devil's advocate

16:05.957 --> 16:08.107
to see if there could be
a nonparanormal explanation

16:08.226 --> 16:10.293
for what my clients are going through.

16:10.378 --> 16:11.944
But I got to thinking
about the stuff Terry's

16:12.030 --> 16:14.213
been seeing moving
around in the kitchen,

16:14.332 --> 16:15.431
and I'm wondering if it had something

16:15.517 --> 16:17.800
to do with the house settling.

16:17.886 --> 16:18.935
I'm heading back there now

16:19.070 --> 16:20.903
to meet up with a couple
of building inspectors

16:20.989 --> 16:23.406
to see if there's any
chance that's the case.

16:27.479 --> 16:29.011
Okay, so this is the
reason I called you guys.

16:29.097 --> 16:30.680
I'm investigating the house,

16:30.765 --> 16:32.415
and there's claims
in the house of things

16:32.550 --> 16:33.850
that make no sense to me.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.452
They're talking about
cabinet doors in the kitchen

16:36.538 --> 16:37.620
all opening up.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.155
Nobody's doing it.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.991
Stuff rolling on the floor on its own.

16:42.093 --> 16:43.576
Have you guys ever seen anything

16:43.661 --> 16:47.029
that would cause that
kind of activity to happen?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.431
- Sure, sure.
- Okay.

16:48.533 --> 16:49.732
- So it's possible?
- Yeah.

16:49.834 --> 16:50.967
We'll take a good look at it.

16:51.069 --> 16:52.602
We'll see what's going
on in the interior.

16:52.670 --> 16:53.736
Then we'll report back to you.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.505
Excellent.

16:55.607 --> 16:59.175
With so much bizarre activity
going on inside Terry's house,

16:59.277 --> 17:02.378
I need to rule out the obvious first.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.082
Then I can focus on what
physical evidence can explain.

17:06.184 --> 17:07.683
All right. So what'd you guys find out?

17:07.769 --> 17:08.851
All right. Basically, we found a couple

17:08.953 --> 17:10.720
of cosmetic stuff on the exterior here.

17:10.805 --> 17:12.888
But the house itself
is... It's sound.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.457
So there's nothing wrong in the house

17:14.592 --> 17:16.759
that would make a bottle
just go across the floor

17:16.844 --> 17:18.094
to the other side?

17:18.229 --> 17:20.061
The floor, it's only off about
a half-inch from end to end.

17:20.131 --> 17:21.263
That's typical for a house.

17:21.348 --> 17:23.299
Cabinet doors opening all
on their own, all of them?

17:23.401 --> 17:25.751
No. There's nothing
that would explain that.

17:25.869 --> 17:28.404
Okay. So now I know
at least what it's not.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.340
Right. There's no problem
with the house itself.

17:34.712 --> 17:36.012
So when I pull the deed to the house,

17:36.097 --> 17:39.131
the first family I came
up with was the Blakesleys.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.250
So I called a local author
to look into it for me.

17:41.336 --> 17:43.853
And he said this family
has a very wild story

17:43.955 --> 17:45.871
that will definitely help my case.

17:51.131 --> 17:52.931
You had mentioned on the
phone there was a wild story

17:53.033 --> 17:54.199
connected with this family.

17:54.301 --> 17:56.351
Yeah, it goes back to
one of the Blakesleys,

17:56.470 --> 17:59.597
a woman named Sylvia,
who was born in 1816.

17:59.678 --> 18:02.279
We were able to find a photo of her.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.581
As you can tell, she's
a very stern woman,

18:04.717 --> 18:07.234
and she was married
to a guy named Alfred,

18:07.353 --> 18:08.836
who was a brickmaker.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.354
- He died.
- Okay.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.239
And she took over the business,

18:12.358 --> 18:15.626
which is actually quite
unusual at that time,

18:15.761 --> 18:17.861
for a woman to take over
a business like that.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.416
She must've been a very
independent, powerful,

18:19.516 --> 18:20.932
and ruthless woman.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.167
Well, what do you mean by ruthless?

18:22.269 --> 18:24.853
In two different cases,
Sylvia actually sued

18:24.972 --> 18:29.140
two close family members over money.

18:29.226 --> 18:31.109
Over money. Okay. Who was the first one?

18:31.211 --> 18:36.151
Her sister and her nephew
both owed her money,

18:36.251 --> 18:38.518
so she sued them to get the money back.

18:38.604 --> 18:42.255
She ended up getting a
judge to go and put a lien

18:42.341 --> 18:43.306
on all of their stuff.

18:43.425 --> 18:44.574
On her sister and her own nephew?

18:44.660 --> 18:45.826
Correct.

18:45.961 --> 18:47.928
She's a real piece of work, this woman.

18:48.013 --> 18:49.096
Okay. So that's the first one.

18:49.181 --> 18:50.263
What was the second one?

18:50.349 --> 18:53.667
Eight years later, her
son and her grandson

18:53.752 --> 18:55.869
both have their own
brickmaking business,

18:55.938 --> 18:59.740
and she sues them when
their business fell under.

18:59.825 --> 19:01.324
And why'd she do that?

19:01.410 --> 19:04.311
Well, because it would
protect her from the debtors.

19:04.446 --> 19:06.747
And I have an article about it.

19:06.832 --> 19:08.849
This is one cold-hearted

19:08.934 --> 19:10.817
Yeah, and that's not all.

19:10.903 --> 19:14.070
She also institutionalized
her own grand-nephew.

19:14.189 --> 19:15.355
Okay. So what's the story with that?

19:15.491 --> 19:17.124
This man's name is Fred Blakesley.

19:17.259 --> 19:18.425
Okay.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.545
And he fell in love with
Sylvia's daughter, Lucy.

19:21.663 --> 19:23.613
Sylvia and her husband did not approve

19:23.732 --> 19:27.434
of Fred Blakesley's obsession with Lucy.

19:27.519 --> 19:30.170
Sylvia filed court papers
to get him committed

19:30.255 --> 19:32.806
into the state insane asylum.

19:32.908 --> 19:35.459
And here's the papers.

19:35.577 --> 19:37.077
Okay. So if she's not suing the family,

19:37.162 --> 19:38.745
she's having them committed.

19:38.831 --> 19:41.047
Just another way to show who's boss.

19:44.720 --> 19:49.055
The old woman, I know she goes way back.

19:49.191 --> 19:50.474
She and her two henchmen

19:50.559 --> 19:55.011
definitely lived here at some point,

19:55.130 --> 19:57.214
and they had a business here.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.800
I feel like one of them was her husband,

19:59.902 --> 20:01.201
and he was, like, the figurehead.

20:01.336 --> 20:03.737
But she was really the one in charge.

20:03.806 --> 20:07.607
She was business.

20:07.709 --> 20:09.476
I think they had a lot of money.

20:09.578 --> 20:12.612
One of these men, I think, was in a camp

20:12.748 --> 20:15.632
at some point, like, a
prison camp or something.

20:15.751 --> 20:16.666
Okay.

20:16.752 --> 20:20.120
He thinks she killed him.

20:20.189 --> 20:22.589
He just... just despises her.

20:28.697 --> 20:29.996
If you need us to investigate

20:30.098 --> 20:31.898
unexplained activity in your home,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.968
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

20:35.070 --> 20:36.570
Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

20:36.655 --> 20:37.704
and we'll help if we can.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.990
So far, I've got
a family living in fear

20:49.090 --> 20:51.991
on a property connected
to a lot of suffering.

20:52.093 --> 20:53.776
But I need to see if there's
anything else that could help

20:53.895 --> 20:55.361
my investigation.

20:55.464 --> 20:58.097
Searching through old records,
I find a gruesome murder

20:58.200 --> 21:01.818
involving an
18-year-old farmhand.

21:01.903 --> 21:03.803
Turns out he fatally stabbed a woman

21:03.905 --> 21:07.340
right next to my client's property.

21:07.442 --> 21:09.809
So I've asked a retired
cop to look into it for me.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.479
He described it as one of
the most savage homicides

21:12.581 --> 21:14.347
in the town's history.

21:18.186 --> 21:20.220
So, Jerry, thanks for meeting
me and helping me out with this.

21:20.305 --> 21:22.272
What'd you find out about the homicide?

21:22.357 --> 21:25.975
July 24, 1853, there was a
guy named Brazila Bradley.

21:26.061 --> 21:27.694
He lived right next to
your clients' property.

21:27.762 --> 21:29.429
Brazila takes his kids to church.

21:29.514 --> 21:32.582
His wife, Esther Bradley, stayed
behind because she was sick.

21:32.701 --> 21:35.168
They had an 18-year-old Irish
farmhand named Michael Jennings

21:35.303 --> 21:36.836
who came there to rob 'em.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.087
He discovered the wife in her house.

21:38.206 --> 21:41.674
And he stabs her approximately 50 times,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.410
cutting off her nose,
stabbing the head, the chest,

21:44.546 --> 21:47.380
and stabbed her once so violently

21:47.516 --> 21:49.532
that the tip of the knife
broke off in her breastbone.

21:49.651 --> 21:50.650
50 times?

21:50.735 --> 21:51.985
50 times. Crime of passion.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.419
- Yeah.
- You and I both know it.

21:53.505 --> 21:55.555
So I got to assume this had
to be a huge to-do back then.

21:55.657 --> 21:56.739
All the papers.

21:56.825 --> 21:59.542
Here's one of the articles.

21:59.661 --> 22:01.661
Okay.

22:01.763 --> 22:02.929
So what happened with him?

22:03.064 --> 22:05.481
He goes on trial. He's
convicted of murder.

22:05.567 --> 22:07.217
They send him up to Newgate Prison,

22:07.302 --> 22:08.868
which is a hell on Earth.

22:08.954 --> 22:11.538
And almost a year later, he's hung

22:11.623 --> 22:15.225
in front of a very large crowd,
estimated at about 400 people.

22:15.343 --> 22:19.662
Here's an article on the
execution of Michael Jennings.

22:19.748 --> 22:21.531
He deserved it.

22:25.687 --> 22:29.355
I'm seeing that guy
bleeding from his hands again,

22:29.457 --> 22:31.207
and it's, like, shock.

22:31.326 --> 22:32.892
He's feeling, "What
the happened?

22:33.028 --> 22:35.511
What the
happened? What's going on?"

22:35.597 --> 22:38.531
Does not have any clue what
the just went down.

22:42.470 --> 22:43.503
I'm dizzy.

22:43.605 --> 22:45.204
I'm having back pain,

22:45.307 --> 22:49.959
specifically here, very, very bad.

22:50.045 --> 22:52.845
Really bad, though, really bad.

22:52.948 --> 22:56.382
It's like like, in your ears,

22:56.518 --> 22:57.850
and you're like, "Ah."

22:57.953 --> 23:00.386
I don't like it.

23:07.329 --> 23:09.696
Pain is following me.

23:09.781 --> 23:12.565
Somebody's crawling on
the ground behind me.

23:12.667 --> 23:15.335
They're hanging onto my spine.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.769
It's the female.

23:16.871 --> 23:18.905
She can hurt you.

23:19.007 --> 23:20.807
She can hurt living people.

23:20.909 --> 23:22.191
I need her the off.

23:22.277 --> 23:23.643
Oh, I don't like this.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.011
I need her off.

23:25.113 --> 23:28.314
Like, now, I'm, like, all creeped out.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.617
Like, maybe she's,
like, from a cemetery,

23:30.719 --> 23:32.885
like, nearby or something?

23:33.021 --> 23:34.220
Are we dealing with, like,

23:34.356 --> 23:36.572
bodies buried here,
and they're pissed off,

23:36.691 --> 23:38.358
and they're, like, wreaking havoc?

23:45.433 --> 23:47.583
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

23:47.702 --> 23:50.903
but the P.K. manifestation
hovering over a living person

23:51.006 --> 23:53.339
has me the most concerned.

23:53.441 --> 23:55.775
It was all black.

23:55.860 --> 24:03.583
It had a human arm and
leg coming out of it.

24:03.668 --> 24:10.056
And then kind of in the
center, was this female.

24:12.427 --> 24:14.394
- It makes you frightened?
- Mm.

24:22.003 --> 24:23.803
Amy, is this what you saw?

24:25.940 --> 24:27.907
Yes, that's what I saw.

24:47.457 --> 24:50.191
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

24:50.293 --> 24:51.476
we're ready to reveal our findings

24:51.594 --> 24:55.029
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

24:55.131 --> 24:56.931
Amy, I'd like you to meet Anthony,

24:57.033 --> 24:59.067
and this is his mom, Terry.

24:59.152 --> 25:00.368
About a year ago,

25:00.470 --> 25:03.187
Anthony moved in here
with his husband, Carlos,

25:03.273 --> 25:05.473
and that's when all hell broke loose.

25:05.608 --> 25:08.543
Now, I want to show you who
else lives in their house.

25:08.645 --> 25:13.264
So this is Rich, Terry's husband.

25:13.383 --> 25:15.550
This is Carlos, who's Anthony's husband.

25:15.685 --> 25:18.019
These are his two
brothers, Louie and Richard.

25:18.121 --> 25:20.722
Now, Anthony thinks
that when he came home,

25:20.824 --> 25:23.958
he triggered something that
puts the whole family in danger.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.993
And that's why he called us in.

25:26.079 --> 25:28.363
Now that Amy knows a
little bit about you guys,

25:28.465 --> 25:30.865
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

25:34.404 --> 25:38.673
One of the first things
that I saw was upstairs,

25:38.775 --> 25:43.594
and I saw blood all over the floor.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.497
And the blood led out of the bathroom

25:46.616 --> 25:48.983
and into the hallway.

25:49.069 --> 25:53.071
I was experiencing it
through the individual

25:53.189 --> 25:55.189
that had the initial experience.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.558
And I saw my hands,

25:57.644 --> 26:00.294
and they were a male's hands,

26:00.397 --> 26:03.264
and they had blood on them.

26:03.349 --> 26:09.937
And the male was feeling very confused.

26:10.039 --> 26:13.408
Just... it's just wow.

26:13.543 --> 26:15.510
We... we found blood.

26:15.612 --> 26:18.079
We were in the basement,
and we had opened the door,

26:18.181 --> 26:19.547
and there was droplets of blood

26:19.649 --> 26:21.365
right in front of the
door of the basement

26:21.484 --> 26:23.651
and up the stairs, into the hallway

26:23.736 --> 26:25.803
and through the closed
door into the bathroom.

26:25.889 --> 26:27.438
Her husband, Rich, is a cop.

26:27.524 --> 26:29.323
He investigated this thoroughly

26:29.409 --> 26:34.145
and couldn't figure out
what the hell this came from.

26:34.264 --> 26:36.531
Now, this is a long shot,

26:36.616 --> 26:38.800
but when you said you saw a
guy acting confused with blood

26:38.902 --> 26:40.218
on his hands,

26:40.336 --> 26:43.004
it made me think about something
I came across in my research.

26:43.527 --> 26:46.195
Now, in 1853, there
was a 43-year-old woman

26:46.280 --> 26:48.697
named Esther Bradley that
lived next to your property.

26:48.799 --> 26:53.202
And her husband and
two kids went to church,

26:53.337 --> 26:55.654
and she wasn't feeling
well and stayed back.

26:55.773 --> 26:59.007
An Irish farmhand that
worked for the family,

26:59.109 --> 27:00.943
18 years old,

27:01.078 --> 27:03.579
went into the house to
rob it and found her there.

27:03.681 --> 27:05.714
He wound up stabbing her to death.

27:05.816 --> 27:08.317
And he stabbed her 50 times.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.986
50 times?

27:11.071 --> 27:13.222
The head, the neck, the chest.

27:13.307 --> 27:15.340
One of the stab wounds was
so bad he actually broke off

27:15.426 --> 27:18.360
the tip of the knife in her chest.

27:18.462 --> 27:22.297
They did catch him at the train
station with blood, the knife.

27:22.399 --> 27:23.515
Stayed in jail for about a year.

27:23.601 --> 27:24.566
And then, they hung him.

27:24.652 --> 27:27.102
Good.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.687
So what else did you see?

27:28.772 --> 27:32.524
There are three
conscious dead people here

27:32.643 --> 27:34.476
that I'm very concerned about.

27:34.612 --> 27:37.746
There are two males and one female,

27:37.831 --> 27:39.448
and they are all elderly.

27:39.533 --> 27:44.102
The female has the two
men attached to her.

27:44.221 --> 27:46.421
She's, like, the boss of these two guys.

27:46.557 --> 27:50.576
The intentions there are
not particularly friendly.

27:52.396 --> 27:57.165
The two men, they're very
physical, very strong.

27:57.251 --> 28:00.235
She's extremely intelligent

28:00.337 --> 28:04.940
and is consistently manipulating them.

28:05.042 --> 28:07.809
One of the men told me,

28:07.912 --> 28:09.695
"She has malicious intentions.

28:09.780 --> 28:12.164
She's forcing us to do this."

28:12.283 --> 28:15.150
So if they have bad intentions,
what... what are they doing?

28:15.286 --> 28:18.070
There was definitely
physical touching and attacks,

28:18.155 --> 28:23.091
pushing, shoving,
pinching, things like that.

28:23.193 --> 28:26.595
I got, like, somebody being
kind of shoved into the walls.

28:29.266 --> 28:31.600
I get dizzy in the stairwell.

28:31.685 --> 28:33.302
Do you ever feel
yourself getting...

28:33.387 --> 28:35.604
like you were getting pushed
into a wall and not realize it?

28:35.706 --> 28:38.373
- Yes.
- Interesting. Okay.

28:38.475 --> 28:40.475
The other thing
that I got...

28:40.611 --> 28:46.982
She was making two
people in the house ill,

28:47.117 --> 28:51.153
and the first one that I got
specifically was a living woman.

28:51.255 --> 28:53.088
I saw her in the master bedroom,

28:53.190 --> 28:57.259
and she was crying and
in a deep depression

28:57.344 --> 29:01.129
and that she was on the
verge of a nervous breakdown.

29:01.231 --> 29:05.033
Oh, my God.

29:05.119 --> 29:07.269
That's me. That's me.

29:07.354 --> 29:10.806
I have been horrible all
over the place, crying.

29:10.891 --> 29:14.276
I don't know if I should be,
like, upset or more than pissed.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.111
- She's affecting two people?
- Yeah.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.514
The second was a living
male having heart pain

29:19.616 --> 29:21.616
- or chest pain.
- Oh, my God.

29:21.719 --> 29:23.852
So significant heart problems.

29:23.937 --> 29:26.288
I didn't know if it
was high blood pressure,

29:26.390 --> 29:28.256
high cholesterol or both.

29:28.342 --> 29:30.592
This person already had this condition,

29:30.694 --> 29:34.079
but the woman and the two guys
with her are making it worse.

29:34.164 --> 29:36.631
And they're really
focused on trying to...

29:36.767 --> 29:38.867
to fatally harm him.

29:39.003 --> 29:40.285
- Oh, my God.
- And I don't know why.

29:40.371 --> 29:42.771
I've had heart issues.

29:42.856 --> 29:45.824
Just when I moved back in last year.

29:45.943 --> 29:47.959
I never had problems before.
Never had a heart issue before.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.544
- I mean...
- Well, how old are you?

29:49.630 --> 29:51.980
22.

29:52.066 --> 29:53.899
How can she do this?

29:53.984 --> 29:56.485
I wish I could just grab her.

29:56.587 --> 29:59.254
I want to strangle the

29:59.339 --> 30:00.475
You ever get an idea of who she was

30:00.575 --> 30:02.041
and who these two guys were,
maybe when they were alive?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.326
This is what I got.

30:03.394 --> 30:06.162
At least one of them,
I believe, lived here.

30:06.264 --> 30:09.198
And the other two might
have lived around or nearby.

30:09.300 --> 30:12.768
I think they owned a business here,

30:12.871 --> 30:15.605
and at least one of them
died here on the land.

30:15.740 --> 30:18.724
The female was able to control these men

30:18.810 --> 30:21.978
when they were alive as well,
so it's not just in death.

30:22.113 --> 30:24.947
I got that, you know,
she was pretty far back.

30:25.049 --> 30:27.783
She was all about business. I
think she had a lot of money.

30:27.919 --> 30:30.152
She made it very clear
that she was the one

30:30.238 --> 30:34.156
who really called all the
shots, especially with finances.

30:34.259 --> 30:37.493
As far as the men, I think at one point,

30:37.595 --> 30:38.761
one of them might have been her husband,

30:38.897 --> 30:40.129
and then, the other guy, I...

30:40.231 --> 30:42.665
The one thing with him was
that he had been in a camp

30:42.750 --> 30:47.119
at some point, like a prison camp.

30:47.205 --> 30:48.504
You talking about a
woman who lived here,

30:48.640 --> 30:51.490
had a lot of money,

30:51.576 --> 30:52.992
and based on some of
the things you said,

30:53.111 --> 30:54.944
was a real piece of work, obviously.

30:55.013 --> 30:56.262
Now, that makes me think of a woman

30:56.381 --> 30:59.282
who did live on that
property, Sylvia Blakesley.

30:59.384 --> 31:03.603
Now, Sylvia married a
guy who died in 1886,

31:03.721 --> 31:06.405
and she took over his
brickmaking business.

31:06.524 --> 31:08.357
Back then, in the 1800s,

31:08.443 --> 31:10.927
a woman didn't take over a
man's business and run it.

31:11.012 --> 31:13.396
She ruled with an iron
fist from what I was told.

31:13.481 --> 31:16.015
She was business-savvy, ruthless.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.650
She sued her own sister

31:17.769 --> 31:20.102
and nephew over a small amount of money.

31:20.238 --> 31:22.872
Next thing she wound up
doing is suing her son

31:22.957 --> 31:25.675
and her grandson because
they went bankrupt,

31:25.760 --> 31:28.811
and she didn't want the
creditors coming after her.

31:28.896 --> 31:30.513
Now, you said something
about one of them guys

31:30.598 --> 31:32.515
being in a prison camp.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.216
In 1895,

31:34.319 --> 31:37.453
her nephew Fred fell in
love with her daughter, Lucy.

31:37.538 --> 31:40.656
So now, Sylvia wasn't too fond
of the fact that her nephew

31:40.758 --> 31:43.592
was trying to get romantically
involved with her daughter.

31:43.728 --> 31:46.946
So she filed papers with the courts

31:47.031 --> 31:49.665
to have him committed
to an insane asylum.

31:49.767 --> 31:51.133
- What?
- God.

31:51.235 --> 31:53.469
Now, I was able to track
down a photo of her.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.456
Now, do you think that
might've been the woman you saw?

31:57.542 --> 31:59.425
Oh, yeah.

31:59.510 --> 32:00.710
I could see it.

32:00.845 --> 32:02.745
Now, you got a face

32:02.830 --> 32:04.997
to what's causing some
of the problems here.

32:05.116 --> 32:06.999
I told you they weren't good. Told you.

32:07.085 --> 32:09.685
You did tell me that.
You did tell me that.

32:11.522 --> 32:13.823
When I...

32:13.958 --> 32:17.176
Okay.

32:17.295 --> 32:23.632
When I went into the kitchen, um...

32:23.768 --> 32:25.134
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:25.269 --> 32:27.803
I'm all right.

32:27.939 --> 32:32.675
What I saw was that you
have a fully developed

32:32.777 --> 32:35.861
P.K. manifestation here.

32:35.980 --> 32:36.946
What does that mean?

32:37.048 --> 32:38.264
More than likely,

32:38.383 --> 32:43.219
somebody within the household
has latent abilities.

32:43.354 --> 32:46.222
And that ability would be
telekinesis, or psychokinesis,

32:46.307 --> 32:48.841
okay, which is the ability
to affect your surroundings

32:48.926 --> 32:50.993
without physical contact.

32:51.079 --> 32:55.464
The initial thing that happens
is a poltergeist will develop.

32:55.566 --> 32:58.234
Oh, my gosh.

32:58.319 --> 33:00.336
What can happen is that
poltergeist lingers,

33:00.421 --> 33:02.705
and it pulls more energy and
more energy and more energy.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.206
And over a lot of time,

33:04.308 --> 33:07.543
it starts to become a
conscious, functioning,

33:07.645 --> 33:09.395
independent entity.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.181
Unfortunately, that's
what's happened here.

33:12.316 --> 33:16.102
It is very aware. It's very nasty.

33:16.187 --> 33:17.853
It has an intense personality.

33:17.955 --> 33:19.972
It was yelling, hissing,
and growling at me.

33:20.091 --> 33:21.557
- Oh, my God.
- It was swearing at me.

33:21.659 --> 33:23.526
It's... it can
be very physical.

33:23.628 --> 33:25.628
And then, I started seeing
the physical phenomena

33:25.713 --> 33:26.829
that was happening in the kitchen,

33:26.964 --> 33:29.665
like, one thing, like,
I was turned around.

33:29.767 --> 33:31.967
And then, I turned back at the table,

33:32.053 --> 33:32.968
and all the chairs had moved.

33:33.104 --> 33:36.589
- Oh, my God.
- And I was like, "Whoa."

33:36.674 --> 33:37.807
And then, I turn around,

33:37.892 --> 33:39.875
and I saw that the cabinets were opened.

33:39.977 --> 33:42.478
Oh, my God.

33:42.613 --> 33:44.914
Okay, all the cabinets
were opened one morning.

33:45.016 --> 33:47.616
- Every single cabinet.
- Every single one.

33:47.702 --> 33:48.918
And the chandelier moved on its own.

33:49.003 --> 33:50.352
The chandelier moved on its own.

33:50.488 --> 33:51.654
Now, when you were telling me

33:51.739 --> 33:52.855
about what was going on in the kitchen,

33:52.990 --> 33:54.423
I had to do my due diligence

33:54.525 --> 33:57.109
and had the house
checked by two inspectors

33:57.228 --> 33:58.961
to see if the house was off.

33:59.097 --> 34:01.297
It's off by a half-inch,
which is pretty common.

34:01.432 --> 34:03.466
You have a tilt coming this way.

34:03.551 --> 34:05.684
But it's not enough to have
cabinets and chandeliers

34:05.803 --> 34:07.937
moving on their own.

34:08.039 --> 34:09.789
The house is structurally sound.

34:09.907 --> 34:11.873
So now, this thing that you're
talking about, this P.K.,

34:11.958 --> 34:13.641
now, is it only in the
kitchen, this thing?

34:13.744 --> 34:18.047
Uh, no. It's extremely active
in several of the bedrooms.

34:18.132 --> 34:21.516
Specifically, I saw it messing
with someone in the bedroom

34:21.601 --> 34:23.052
with the red comforter.

34:23.137 --> 34:26.088
The individual who had
something to do with the creation

34:26.190 --> 34:30.109
of this had a lot of
issues with this person

34:30.194 --> 34:33.094
in this room, and these
are unresolved issues.

34:33.181 --> 34:35.898
The living person in that
room is constantly hearing,

34:35.983 --> 34:38.266
like, whispering.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.870
The thing's, like,
trying to threaten them.

34:40.972 --> 34:43.706
Like, basically, the
overall feeling and vibe

34:43.808 --> 34:45.674
is that it's gonna get them.

34:45.810 --> 34:48.010
Also, what I was
seeing was the...

34:48.146 --> 34:52.114
It getting physical, hitting the bed.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.065
I felt the mattress jolting up.

34:54.185 --> 34:57.953
I saw it trying to bite or
scratch or burn this person

34:58.039 --> 35:03.125
and trying to hit this
person, pulling their hair.

35:03.211 --> 35:06.512
Now, Richard, his girlfriend, Sophie,

35:06.631 --> 35:08.464
- she don't stay here anymore.
- Right.

35:08.549 --> 35:11.617
She won't even come
here when it's dark out.

35:11.736 --> 35:15.070
Would you mind telling Amy about
what happened to her one night?

35:15.206 --> 35:21.544
She was held down in the bed,
and it was scratching her neck,

35:21.646 --> 35:24.263
and something bit her.

35:24.382 --> 35:26.715
Now, you mentioned something
about the bed shaking?

35:26.801 --> 35:28.050
- Yeah.
- Happened to Carlos?

35:28.152 --> 35:29.635
Yes, one time, he woke up,

35:29.720 --> 35:30.803
and there was, like, someone banging

35:30.888 --> 35:33.189
at the foot of the bed.

35:33.291 --> 35:35.291
And someone was, like,
it was almost like they

35:35.393 --> 35:37.626
were punching the bottom of
the bed through the mattress

35:37.728 --> 35:38.961
so it would shake.

35:39.046 --> 35:40.062
Okay.

35:40.164 --> 35:42.815
What I was seeing, it was really weird.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.201
And so I did have a sketch done.

35:48.206 --> 35:53.042
This reminds me of something
that Sophie explained to me.

35:53.127 --> 35:55.127
Oh, my God.

36:03.521 --> 36:08.107
I've seen this face.

36:08.226 --> 36:11.377
Everybody in the house
is seeing shadow figures

36:11.495 --> 36:12.912
in different sizes.

36:12.997 --> 36:16.432
Sophie mentioned to me that
she saw this thing pillow-sized.

36:16.534 --> 36:18.734
Okay, interesting.

36:18.836 --> 36:20.202
It can change its size.

36:20.288 --> 36:23.005
It can be very small, very large.

36:23.107 --> 36:25.891
This is the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

36:25.977 --> 36:27.993
I know from working with her,
what she was saying before,

36:28.079 --> 36:32.615
this P.K. is developed
from a living agent,

36:32.700 --> 36:34.283
usually in the house, correct?

36:34.418 --> 36:35.417
Yeah.

36:35.519 --> 36:38.153
You have any idea who it may be?

36:38.239 --> 36:40.322
What I got about this person

36:40.458 --> 36:45.527
was that the person's
extremely stressed out, female.

36:45.630 --> 36:50.065
And she had brown hair,

36:50.201 --> 36:53.535
about 45 years old, shorter than myself,

36:53.621 --> 36:56.989
going through hormonal changes.

36:57.074 --> 36:59.358
Yep, that's me.

36:59.477 --> 37:02.244
I'm having a little heart pain.

37:08.803 --> 37:10.686
So I caused this?

37:29.252 --> 37:30.123
You okay, buddy?

37:30.223 --> 37:31.172
Yeah. I just needed an...

37:31.257 --> 37:33.858
All right. Just
take a deep breath.

37:33.994 --> 37:35.760
I know. Okay.

37:35.895 --> 37:37.061
Oh, my God.

37:37.147 --> 37:39.731
- Relax.
- I know.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.899
I'm feeling like I
brought all of this...

37:42.002 --> 37:44.652
I know. I don't want
you to feel that way.

37:44.771 --> 37:48.640
It's not like you did this maliciously.

37:48.775 --> 37:50.408
It's all of your stress.

37:50.510 --> 37:53.194
It's all of your pain.
It's all of your fears.

37:53.279 --> 37:55.179
It's all of your anger

37:55.281 --> 38:00.084
and, like, things that you
weren't able to deal with.

38:00.220 --> 38:02.136
And you put 'em all in this little ball,

38:02.255 --> 38:05.156
and it's completely uncontrollable.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.875
And you don't even know you have it,

38:07.994 --> 38:11.312
so you can't do the
things to shut it down.

38:11.431 --> 38:12.730
Listen, I... I
don't want to bring it up,

38:12.832 --> 38:15.083
but I want to make sure we
diagnose this the right way.

38:15.201 --> 38:16.250
You had mentioned to me, with Anthony,

38:16.369 --> 38:18.736
you weren't happy about him being gay.

38:18.838 --> 38:19.771
Mm-hmm.

38:19.873 --> 38:23.474
It was very difficult, yes.

38:23.576 --> 38:24.942
It's not your fault.

38:25.045 --> 38:27.912
Okay, so what's your
relationship like with Sophie?

38:28.014 --> 38:32.383
Richard says I hate
all of his girlfriends.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.819
So I'm wondering if
that's the same situation

38:34.904 --> 38:36.304
because what's happening to Sophie...

38:36.423 --> 38:38.122
- Is happening to him.
- To Carlos.

38:38.224 --> 38:40.007
It could be, yeah.

38:42.562 --> 38:45.129
I just want to know how to stop it.

38:47.867 --> 38:51.185
Well, Anthony, Terry, it's
been a tough night for you guys.

38:51.304 --> 38:54.455
Obviously, you heard things
that you didn't want to hear,

38:54.541 --> 38:55.742
but we don't pull punches.

38:55.842 --> 38:57.175
And that's why you brought us in.

38:57.277 --> 38:59.244
So now, we're gonna
answer your big question...

38:59.379 --> 39:01.913
Can you figure out a way how to get rid

39:02.015 --> 39:02.981
of whatever the hell's here

39:03.083 --> 39:04.382
so that you can live
here with your husband

39:04.518 --> 39:06.551
and with the rest of your family?

39:06.687 --> 39:08.820
So, for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:15.443 --> 39:18.327
So the first thing
that we're gonna address

39:18.462 --> 39:20.596
is the P.K. manifestation.

39:20.698 --> 39:23.899
There are several things that
I would like for you to do.

39:24.001 --> 39:28.487
I want you to get what's
called craniosacral therapy.

39:28.606 --> 39:31.507
What the practitioner will do
is they'll place their hands

39:31.592 --> 39:34.176
on various parts of your body.

39:34.278 --> 39:38.797
And what this does is it's
an energetic form of healing.

39:38.883 --> 39:40.149
Okay.

39:40.234 --> 39:42.851
The other thing is that I would like you

39:42.953 --> 39:45.354
to look up Tibetan monk chanting.

39:45.439 --> 39:47.756
This is another way
that you can release,

39:47.842 --> 39:50.893
physically into the
environment, beauty, okay,

39:50.978 --> 39:55.699
and to, again, balance
your body physiologically,

39:55.799 --> 39:57.198
mentally, emotionally.

39:57.334 --> 39:58.450
Okay.

39:58.535 --> 40:01.186
As far as the P.K. manifestation,

40:01.305 --> 40:03.104
what's gonna happen is
over a period of time,

40:03.190 --> 40:04.472
- it'll dissipate...
- Okay.

40:04.608 --> 40:09.244
Because it will have
nothing to feed off of anymore.

40:09.346 --> 40:12.013
The next thing is to get rid of

40:12.115 --> 40:14.182
the three dead people that we have here.

40:14.318 --> 40:19.204
What I would like is someone
who is a psychic knower

40:19.323 --> 40:23.124
who also practices demonology.

40:23.710 --> 40:25.910
Now, we don't have a demon here,

40:25.995 --> 40:31.282
but we have very,
very nasty dead person.

40:31.367 --> 40:34.135
The demonology part of
it, with their experience,

40:34.220 --> 40:37.455
is that they're gonna
know how to exorcise her.

40:37.540 --> 40:40.641
So I do want an exorcism
performed by this person

40:40.743 --> 40:44.178
to throw her out.

40:44.280 --> 40:48.616
The old men, they're
basically trapped here by her.

40:48.718 --> 40:52.803
Once she's gone, they're
gonna want to leave.

40:52.889 --> 40:54.489
If we come back in a year,

40:54.574 --> 40:56.524
if they follow the advice you gave them,

40:56.609 --> 40:58.326
are we gonna see
a much happier...

40:58.428 --> 41:02.196
Oh, yeah. Oh, it'll be so, so different.

41:02.298 --> 41:04.215
That's what we need.

41:04.334 --> 41:07.535
I'm really rooting for you guys.

41:07.620 --> 41:09.270
There's one other thing
You got to promise me

41:09.355 --> 41:10.938
that you're not gonna beat
yourself up about this.

41:11.024 --> 41:13.107
Well, I... of course I'm
gonna feel a little guilty,

41:13.243 --> 41:17.812
but knowing that I can fix it
will hopefully dissipate that.

41:17.914 --> 41:19.997
Okay. You gonna take Amy's advice?

41:20.116 --> 41:21.282
I'll make it work.

41:21.417 --> 41:22.650
Of course, absolutely.

41:22.785 --> 41:24.685
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

41:24.771 --> 41:26.871
We'll find people as soon as we can.

41:26.956 --> 41:30.091
Thank God we know what is going on now,

41:30.226 --> 41:32.627
and we can get rid of it.

41:32.729 --> 41:36.334
Anthony and Terry have
a difficult road ahead of them
