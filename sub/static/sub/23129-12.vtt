00:02.070 --> 00:02.764
- Previously...

00:02.800 --> 00:04.325
- I've been here before.

00:04.370 --> 00:05.622
Someone got murdered here.

00:05.670 --> 00:06.762
No!

00:06.800 --> 00:08.029
- You sold the house?

00:08.070 --> 00:09.105
- I'll need your keys

00:09.140 --> 00:10.767
by the end of the week.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.630
- You can't go.
- Who are you?

00:12.680 --> 00:13.772
- My name is Ramona.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.608
- Did you live
here with anybody?

00:15.640 --> 00:19.747
- My mom, my dad, Bea.
- Beatrice?

00:19.780 --> 00:22.090
Is that your sister?
- My twin.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.588
- I'm here to talk
about Ramona.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.384
- If you come back
and harass me...

00:25.420 --> 00:28.355
- Oh my God!
- ...I'll have you arrested.

00:28.390 --> 00:31.519
- Please don't leave me. You're
the only thing keeping me safe.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.393
- I can't be the only thing
that keeps you human.

00:34.430 --> 00:37.764
- I wanna live a life. I wanna
have a life, with Astrid.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.537
- Josh!

00:40.570 --> 00:42.402
(Nora): He did
this to protect me.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.102
- Everything's
gonna be OK. T'll clean up.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.131
- Where's Astrid?
- She's dead.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.103
She told Mark
and the rest of them

00:49.150 --> 00:50.345
she was leaving with you.

00:50.380 --> 00:51.643
Mark didn't like that.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.546
- I don't know how
to feel, what to do.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.275
- Leave Boston.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.379
(Gasping)

00:57.420 --> 00:58.785
- Sorry.

00:58.820 --> 01:01.118
- Josh did this to you?

01:04.390 --> 01:08.293
(* Time to Kill
by Gold & Youth *)

01:08.330 --> 01:10.526
(Sighing)

01:16.740 --> 01:22.179
** Poisoned hollowed townies
wallow on the corner *

01:22.210 --> 01:23.848
- It's time.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.442
* Take the
power lines back home... *

01:28.480 --> 01:31.415
You said yourself your
days in Boston are numbered.

01:31.450 --> 01:34.317
And I only want
what's best for you.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.455
- That's all you've ever
wanted, right, Pops?

01:37.490 --> 01:41.256
- A new city, a new name,
a chance to start over

01:41.300 --> 01:44.167
and finally be
whoever you wanna be.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.567
There's a sizeable chunk
of the human population

01:46.600 --> 01:47.863
that would jump at that.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.700
- And I would too,
if I had Astrid.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.606
* This is our time to feel... *

01:57.650 --> 01:58.708
- Look...

01:59.720 --> 02:01.472
I know how it is.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.749
When you're a vampire

02:02.790 --> 02:04.747
that's been around
for as long as I have,

02:04.790 --> 02:07.760
I have had to face this kind
of loss, again and again.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.758
- You're saying
it gets easier with time?

02:09.789 --> 02:11.758
(Sighing)

02:11.790 --> 02:14.191
I'm not gonna run,

02:14.230 --> 02:17.359
not until I'm facing
the one who did this,

02:17.400 --> 02:20.370
looking him in the eye
and ending him.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.165
And you know why
I have to make sure

02:23.210 --> 02:25.201
that her death
does not go unanswered?

02:25.240 --> 02:28.505
- See, Kenny, the thing about
revenge is it's a temporary fix.

02:28.540 --> 02:31.373
I mean, it will fill
that hole inside you, sure,

02:31.410 --> 02:32.514
for the moment.

02:32.550 --> 02:33.620
But then,

02:33.650 --> 02:36.517
it will begin to eat
away at who you are

02:36.550 --> 02:40.384
until there is
so much emptiness

02:40.420 --> 02:45.381
that nothing, no one, will ever
be able to fill you back up.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.853
- That happened
to you, didn't it?

02:47.900 --> 02:49.265
- Yes, Kenny, it did.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.359
It took me the better
part of this century

02:51.400 --> 02:52.663
to crawl my way out of it.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.759
- I guess we
are kind of similar.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.737
We're very loyal to the people
that we actually care about.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.329
- You're my son.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.542
And we'll see
each other again.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.776
We will. That's
how this works.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.384
(Sighing)

03:09.420 --> 03:11.684
I hate to remind you of this,
but it's moving day.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.654
Do you have
the keys to that van?

03:13.690 --> 03:16.557
* Just hardened heads
to realign *

03:16.590 --> 03:17.785
(Sighing)

03:17.830 --> 03:20.527
- It's just things
are changing, aren't they?

03:21.600 --> 03:22.829
- Change can be good.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.497
* This is our time to kill **

03:24.530 --> 03:25.600
You'll see.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.433
The wheels have
officially been secured.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.369
I hope you guys
are done packing.

03:34.410 --> 03:35.707
- Hello, Aidan.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.242
(Chuckling)

03:37.280 --> 03:40.375
- Hi, Ramona. Um,
you're still here.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.720
Anyway, um, we really
gotta get a move on.

03:43.750 --> 03:44.979
The late fee on a van

03:45.020 --> 03:47.717
that belongs to a secret
vampire organization

03:47.760 --> 03:50.457
is just a little bit
steeper than U-Haul.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.322
- But what about me?

03:52.360 --> 03:55.796
You guys can't
just leave me here.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.822
We belong together,
all of us.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.262
- You know what? Um...

04:05.310 --> 04:09.850
We should talk,
as in the adults.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.405
Can you just
give us a minute?

04:11.450 --> 04:12.576
- Just a minute.
- Yeah?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.611
- We have to do something.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.017
- We can't just leave
her alone in the house.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.711
- I know. I'm
meant to help her.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.889
- You've done everything
you could. What else--

04:20.920 --> 04:22.888
- I know what it's like
to be stuck here!

04:22.930 --> 04:24.580
If I never met you guys,

04:24.630 --> 04:26.621
never figured out how
to get out of here...

04:26.660 --> 04:28.025
She's been here for 40 years!

04:28.060 --> 04:29.824
40 years!

04:29.870 --> 04:32.635
And you guys are
all moving on, and--

04:32.670 --> 04:34.490
- No, I'm not--
- Yes, you are!

04:34.540 --> 04:36.907
And I don't have
a life to move on to.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.738
I don't. That's the truth.

04:38.770 --> 04:42.900
Not really, no matter how much
we wish things were different.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.476
So, I'm gonna help her.

04:45.510 --> 04:48.480
- Because at least that
gives me some sort of purpose.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.885
- Ramona is...
I don't know.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.649
There's just
something about her.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.454
I can't put my finger on it.

04:53.490 --> 04:55.379
- Maybe pushing 11
and sporting corduroy.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.728
- Yeah.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.354
- Corduroy is, traditionally,
the mark of the devil.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.051
- The night with the pack,
like, she locked me in the room.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.990
And maybe she was trying
to get me to protect myself,

05:05.030 --> 05:06.338
but it didn't seem--

05:06.370 --> 05:07.633
- That's what she was doing!

05:07.670 --> 05:09.638
I know what
happened was terrible,

05:09.670 --> 05:11.365
but there were guys
coming at you!

05:11.410 --> 05:12.809
- You know what?
Enough of this.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.400
Look, no one is
staying behind, all right?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.374
I'm gonna help her.
I promise.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.378
We'll talk
to Beatrice again,

05:19.420 --> 05:21.946
dig deeper into the family
history, whatever it takes.

05:21.980 --> 05:22.947
- Thank you.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.685
- I can't stay here.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.949
- OK.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.652
- And I can't leave you behind.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.622
- OK, let me talk
to her alone for a sec.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.823
(* Back Together
by Natalie Taylor *)

05:42.540 --> 05:43.564
She's gone!

05:43.610 --> 05:45.704
- Well, then so are we.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.572
** Open the door *

05:47.610 --> 05:48.680
Let's go.

05:50.410 --> 05:51.775
Come on!

05:51.810 --> 05:55.576
* I know that you
were here before *

05:55.620 --> 05:59.853
* Shadows creep in *

05:59.890 --> 06:05.727
* But I still hold on
to where we've been... *

06:05.760 --> 06:08.457
- Why did you stop
writing in it?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.628
- We lifted the curse.
Everything changed.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.668
* I'll put us back together... *

06:13.700 --> 06:16.829
- It used to give
you a sense of control,

06:16.870 --> 06:20.602
writing down how you
felt after a change.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.574
Maybe it could again.

06:22.610 --> 06:25.602
* I'll put us back together *

06:25.650 --> 06:29.746
* When we're breaking down *

06:29.790 --> 06:32.760
- I'm gonna go get
more boxes for my stuff.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.849
- You can just
put it anywhere.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.882
* Down... *

06:37.930 --> 06:39.455
Josh...

06:40.800 --> 06:43.019
- Well, we never
really talked about it.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.823
I didn't wanna assume anything,

06:45.870 --> 06:47.736
you know, about
what happens next.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.465
- Josh...

06:49.510 --> 06:53.401
- What happened with Sally,
the meditation, it--it worked.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.047
I know it.
I know it. I feel it.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.048
I feel different. I know it.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.777
* I'll bring us
back together... *

07:01.820 --> 07:05.450
But still, it's not...
It's not a guarantee.

07:05.490 --> 07:07.458
- What happens next

07:07.490 --> 07:10.721
is that we're moving into
my apartment, together.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.649
* I'll bring us
back together... **

07:12.700 --> 07:15.158
- And we're staring our life
as a married couple...

07:16.700 --> 07:19.761
finally, just
the two of us.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.063
- Are you sure?

07:21.100 --> 07:24.764
- It may take some time,
but we'll get us back.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.472
- (Sally): Well, I've
never been so grateful

07:27.510 --> 07:29.649
for my serious lack
of material possessions.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.944
- Yeah, it's a good thing
that Nora put a rush job

07:31.980 --> 07:34.472
on the Sally's flesh
and bone wardrobe yard sale--

07:34.520 --> 07:35.544
- Wait, what?
- What?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.617
- She did what?
- What?

07:37.650 --> 07:40.210
- If she got rid of my ombr
tights, so help me, God!

07:40.260 --> 07:42.149
- You can't even
wear your ombr tights!

07:42.190 --> 07:44.887
- Yeah, well, I could make
sure they go to good homes.

07:44.930 --> 07:47.228
This is really,
like, a colossal bummer:

07:47.260 --> 07:48.898
leaving our home,

07:48.930 --> 07:53.629
the possible loss of
my ombr tights for eternity.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.832
At least Josh and Nora
are back together.

07:55.870 --> 07:56.860
- Yep.

07:58.940 --> 08:02.808
- You still haven't told me what
you're doing. What's your plan?

08:02.850 --> 08:05.069
- I don't know. I mean,
I have a couple ideas.

08:08.850 --> 08:10.181
I don't know.

08:10.220 --> 08:13.986
I'm just gonna, maybe, live
at Pete's trailer, you know.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.055
It might be good.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.127
I can't hurt
anyone back there.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.128
And then, you know,

08:19.160 --> 08:22.869
you can do your world
traveling thing, right?

08:22.900 --> 08:26.222
Machu Picchu and
the Canary Islands...

08:26.270 --> 08:28.967
- I actually don't
think I'm gonna go far.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.935
I'm sort of past
the wanderlust stage.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.008
I think it's all
the dimension-hopping.

08:36.909 --> 08:37.876
Or...

08:37.909 --> 08:39.275
(Laughing)

08:39.309 --> 08:42.109
Maybe it's the fact that
everything I care about

08:42.150 --> 08:43.845
is right here in Boston.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.251
- All right, absolutely,
yes, OK, look, look, um...

08:51.330 --> 08:52.286
I'm an idiot.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.150
I can establish
that I'm an idiot.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.622
- It's established, yep.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.799
- Great, perfect,
so check this out: Um...

08:59.770 --> 09:02.262
There is plenty of space
in Pete's trailer,

09:02.300 --> 09:05.702
especially for a woman
who literally takes no space.

09:05.740 --> 09:08.778
- Aidan, wait, are you
asking me to move in with you?

09:08.810 --> 09:12.815
- Mmm, technically, I think
I'm asking you to haunt me.

09:15.950 --> 09:19.181
- What about me?
What about me?

09:19.220 --> 09:22.315
What about me?
What about me?

09:22.360 --> 09:25.660
What about me?
What about me?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.796
What about me?
What about me?

09:28.830 --> 09:30.559
What about me?

09:35.970 --> 09:36.937
- Yes!

09:36.970 --> 09:38.267
- ...all of the cookware--

09:38.310 --> 09:40.631
- Your use for these items is?
- My use?

09:40.680 --> 09:43.001
You saw when I found
the setting for blood nuking!

09:43.050 --> 09:44.006
It was awesomel!

09:44.050 --> 09:45.142
- Take the microwave!

09:45.180 --> 09:46.739
- We'll take the microwave!

09:46.780 --> 09:47.747
- Guys, stop!

09:47.780 --> 09:49.248
This is technically my house!

09:49.280 --> 09:50.611
- Yes, it is.

09:50.650 --> 09:52.687
- It's my house, and
what am I leaving with?

09:52.720 --> 09:54.779
Absolutely nothing,
not even my ombr tights!

09:54.820 --> 09:55.958
- Will you
give it a rest?

09:55.990 --> 09:56.957
- Enough, for real!

09:56.990 --> 09:58.651
Also, are you forgetting

09:58.690 --> 10:00.692
that you can't use
or touch, said items?

10:00.730 --> 10:03.222
- Why would you touch the items?
- Is that really--

10:03.270 --> 10:04.897
- I touch them.
- This is art!

10:04.930 --> 10:07.035
It's supposed to
be admired and adored,

10:07.070 --> 10:08.936
not used, in
any traditional sense.

10:08.970 --> 10:11.132
Look at him,
look at him, look at him.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.377
He's just gazing up at us,

10:13.410 --> 10:18.371
all full of love and admiration,
hope, passion, rigidity.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.187
(Whispering, indistinct)

10:25.220 --> 10:26.710
- What are
you talking about?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.353
- Listen...
- Can we talk about this?

10:28.390 --> 10:30.427
- But he needs...
He deserves a good life.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.427
- He does.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.996
- You're building a home.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.896
We're squatting in a trailer.
- Wait!

10:34.930 --> 10:36.091
- We'll provide for him.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.121
- You should take him.
- Really, yeah.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.660
- We gotta talk--
- Aidan!

10:39.700 --> 10:40.997
- Fine, visitation rights.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.996
- Well, yeah.
- OK?

10:42.040 --> 10:43.007
- Naturally.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.435
So, here's my question: Where
are we eating lunch after this?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.141
I'm starving!
- Please!

10:52.210 --> 10:53.280
Please don't go.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.276
Whoever comes next,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.776
they won't be
able to see me.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.811
Who will I play with then?

10:57.850 --> 10:58.885
(Door buzzer)

10:58.920 --> 11:01.287
- Uh... Jus--

11:05.130 --> 11:06.325
Whoa!

11:06.360 --> 11:07.430
- Uh...

11:07.460 --> 11:10.794
- Beatrice! Ramona,
it's your sis--

11:10.830 --> 11:12.264
- (Aidan):
Come on in.

11:13.270 --> 11:16.433
- Oh, are you moving?

11:16.470 --> 11:18.063
- Uh, yeah, we are.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.306
You caught us in
the middle of it, actually.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.241
- Um, you said
you saw my sister,

11:23.280 --> 11:26.375
that Ramona was
still in the house.

11:26.410 --> 11:29.072
Because if that's true,
if it's really true,

11:29.120 --> 11:32.090
then I need to warn you,
I need to warn all of you.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.451
- I'm sorry, warn us?

11:33.490 --> 11:35.788
- Something terrible
happened here.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.481
- My parents,
Carl and Joy Benson,

11:37.530 --> 11:40.158
they moved into this house
before I was born.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.921
They weren't good people.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.092
- Uh...

11:45.130 --> 11:46.359
- Can you
expound on that?

11:46.400 --> 11:47.868
- (Nora): Please.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.766
- One night, at one
of their parties...

11:49.810 --> 11:50.766
- Hmm.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.766
(Sighing)

11:51.810 --> 11:53.835
- ...they made a new friend.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.905
And he persuaded them

11:55.940 --> 12:00.150
to join a group,
a cult, really.

12:01.350 --> 12:02.420
(Sighing)

12:02.450 --> 12:04.384
They worshipped
the demon Paimon.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.411
- Ah!
- Oh, really!

12:06.450 --> 12:07.986
- Paimon?
- I know!

12:08.020 --> 12:09.112
I know it sounds crazy.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.958
It's not exactly
something I lead with

12:10.990 --> 12:12.890
when meeting people
for the first time.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.922
- A demon, like, a vampire?
- (Aidan): No!

12:15.960 --> 12:20.170
- He's one of the kings of hell,
sort of a henchman for Lucifer.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.262
- Lucifer, the devil,
big red guy?

12:24.310 --> 12:25.266
- Uh-huh.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.539
- Sorry, I don't
mean to...

12:26.570 --> 12:28.208
I just... We,
the group of us,

12:28.240 --> 12:29.947
have a very healthy
understanding

12:29.980 --> 12:30.947
of the supernatural.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.243
- Yeah, what he said.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.977
Listen, um, demons,
as we understand it,

12:35.020 --> 12:37.318
they always offer something
to their followers.

12:37.350 --> 12:39.512
They offer riches
or eternal life. What was--

12:39.550 --> 12:41.211
- Pretty solid
recruitment points.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.422
Well, according
to my parents' friend,

12:43.460 --> 12:47.090
Paimon would reveal to them
all the mysteries of the earth.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.120
- Sure, yeah.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.230
- Was that it?

12:49.260 --> 12:52.059
- But he required an offering,

12:52.100 --> 12:53.966
a sacrifice.

12:55.870 --> 12:59.306
Lucky for Carl and Joy,
they were pregnant with twins

12:59.340 --> 13:01.832
when the group
decided to evoke him.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.877
I did lie to you.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.269
I had a sister.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.118
My parents raised me

13:10.150 --> 13:12.312
with everything
a kid could ask for.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.351
Can I go play?

13:14.590 --> 13:16.854
- Eat your broccoli please.

13:16.890 --> 13:19.120
- But they never
accepted my twin.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.120
They kept her upstairs
in a secret room.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.491
They never introduced her
to the world.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.038
<i>1-- I tried to play with her
whenever I could,</i>

13:32.070 --> 13:33.469
whenever they'd let me.

13:33.510 --> 13:36.138
My parents never
even gave her a name,

13:36.180 --> 13:39.309
but I did:
Ramona.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.478
- And what happened to her?

13:42.520 --> 13:43.487
(Sighing)

13:43.520 --> 13:44.919
- When we were about 10,

13:44.950 --> 13:46.440
my parents threw
another party.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.181
A little smoky?

13:49.220 --> 13:50.528
And in the morning,

13:50.560 --> 13:53.996
when I went upstairs
to play with Ramona...

13:55.100 --> 13:56.522
she was gone.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.563
They boarded up her room.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.865
They told me they
gave Ramona away.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.037
They threatened me.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.471
I could never
speak of her again.

14:12.150 --> 14:15.609
- But you know what happened
to her, don't you, Beatrice?

14:15.650 --> 14:17.379
- No! Let me go!

14:17.420 --> 14:20.082
- (All chanting): The blood
of the child revives us!

14:20.120 --> 14:21.212
- No!

14:22.490 --> 14:24.083
- I didn't find out

14:24.130 --> 14:27.623
who my parents and
their friends really were

14:27.660 --> 14:29.492
till many years later.

14:29.530 --> 14:32.989
- What happened to them?
- Things didn't end well.

14:33.040 --> 14:33.836
- Bea!

14:36.100 --> 14:38.467
- Ramona! Ramona!
Now's your chance.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.229
You just have to tell them
what you wanna say to her.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.443
- Ramona! Is that really you?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.039
- Anyone else have a theory

14:46.080 --> 14:48.970
as to why old Bea here
can see ghosts, some ghosts?

14:49.020 --> 14:52.957
- We're twins. Our bond
is stronger than death.

14:52.990 --> 14:56.016
- I had started to forget
what your face looked like.

14:56.060 --> 14:59.121
I'm so sorry.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.021
- You let me die.

15:03.070 --> 15:06.062
- No! No, I...

15:06.100 --> 15:09.035
- Sure, you were happy to have
someone to play dolls with

15:09.070 --> 15:10.435
every other afternoon,

15:10.470 --> 15:12.939
but when that night came,
you let them murder me!

15:12.980 --> 15:15.506
- You gotta listen to her.
That's not what happened.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.349
It's not her fault.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.145
- I didn't know!
I was just a little girl!

15:20.180 --> 15:22.672
- Yeah, she's right, look.
And it was 40 years--

15:22.720 --> 15:24.279
- I know how long it's been!

15:24.320 --> 15:27.017
- Ramona, listen to me.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.687
You just need to
forgive your sister,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.257
That's what's standing
between you and your door.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.497
You just forgive your
sister, and you move on.

15:33.530 --> 15:34.520
I know it, I know it.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.528
(Gasping)

15:36.560 --> 15:39.120
- Oh!
- What are you doing?

15:39.170 --> 15:41.036
- (Aidan):
Ramona, wait!

15:41.070 --> 15:42.435
(Gasping)

15:42.470 --> 15:45.565
- (Josh): Oh my God!
- (Sally): Ramona, no!

15:45.610 --> 15:46.702
Ramona!

15:51.610 --> 15:53.749
- What the hell
did you do?

15:53.780 --> 15:55.339
- She's not part of our game.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.314
- We need to get out of here!
- Now!

15:57.350 --> 15:59.512
- (Aidan): Let's go!
Come on, come on!

16:12.270 --> 16:13.635
- (Man): Hello, Aidan.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.365
(Echoing): Hello, Aidan.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.074
- Josh, where are you?

16:24.110 --> 16:25.600
Where are you guys?

16:27.150 --> 16:28.447
(Gasping)

16:28.480 --> 16:32.212
Thank God you're here!
What's happening to us?

16:32.250 --> 16:34.355
(Water running)

16:37.130 --> 16:38.757
- Hello?

16:49.440 --> 16:51.169
(Gasping)

16:53.410 --> 16:55.105
- Oh my God!

17:01.280 --> 17:02.418
- Henry?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.142
(Exhaling)

17:06.190 --> 17:08.157
You lived through the virus?

17:08.190 --> 17:12.525
Oh my God! It is so
good to see you, Henry!

17:17.599 --> 17:18.829
It's impossible.

17:18.869 --> 17:20.690
No, that's
not possible.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.538
Henry, no,
no, no, no.

17:22.569 --> 17:23.560
Um...

17:23.609 --> 17:28.480
Vampires can't be ghosts.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.408
- You're wrong, Aidan.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.679
I'm finally free.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.086
- Reveal yourself.

17:38.850 --> 17:42.184
OK! Yep, that just happened!

17:42.220 --> 17:46.589
Hi! Keeping it pretty tight
for a history teacher.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.756
- Thanks.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.820
Yes, I can see you.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.840
I've always been able
to see you, Sally.

17:53.870 --> 17:57.306
I just never had a problem
ignoring you until now.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.102
- You c-can't be here.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.272
You couldn't be.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.846
- It's me, Josh.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.439
- You died.

18:08.650 --> 18:12.609
Jules, the night
I watched you go

18:12.650 --> 18:14.482
was the worst night of my life.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.852
- And that's
saying something.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.853
- You got your door.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.449
Tell me what it's like.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.696
- No, you can't
know any of that,

18:23.730 --> 18:26.893
not now, not
until it's your time.

18:26.930 --> 18:30.309
I came back 'cause
I know where you're headed.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.661
I can see everything.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.608
You need to
listen to me.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.199
Lives depend on it.

18:40.350 --> 18:43.342
- Emily, how
did you get in here?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.745
- I needed to talk
to you, alone.

18:47.220 --> 18:48.779
- Of course,
let's talk. What's--

18:48.820 --> 18:49.912
- It's important.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.396
- Are you drinking?

18:53.430 --> 18:54.727
- Rehab didn't quite take,

18:54.760 --> 18:57.468
but they say it's pretty common
the first time around.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.797
- We're here for you.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.231
You know that.
Anything you need.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.204
- You know what
the most intense part

19:03.240 --> 19:05.208
about all of it
is, the dry out?

19:05.240 --> 19:08.232
It's the sheer
volume of therapy.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.545
Talking about
yourself incessantly,

19:11.580 --> 19:13.241
day after day after day.

19:14.550 --> 19:15.870
But I'll admit,

19:15.920 --> 19:18.719
it taught me something about
why I am the way I am.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.759
We were doing OK, the
Levison clan, you know?

19:24.790 --> 19:26.622
Uptight, sure,

19:26.660 --> 19:30.290
perhaps unhealthy preoccupation
with psychoanalysis

19:30.330 --> 19:34.892
around the dinner table every
taco Tuesday, absolutely.

19:34.940 --> 19:38.535
- But Josh started
spinning out of control.

19:38.570 --> 19:40.572
I remember when
I first found this thing...

19:40.610 --> 19:41.839
(Laughing)

19:41.880 --> 19:43.644
I thought he was a headcase,

19:43.680 --> 19:45.409
but nothing
a steady stream

19:45.450 --> 19:47.919
of my dad's psychotropics
wouldn't fix.

19:47.950 --> 19:52.945
- It isn't easy,
being what we are...

19:54.360 --> 19:55.452
but we make it work.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.514
- Please!

19:56.560 --> 19:58.528
Josh hasn't
made it work.

19:58.560 --> 20:03.293
He's done nothing but indulge
his own messed up impulses

20:03.330 --> 20:05.697
and ruin a whole lot of
lives in the process.

20:07.470 --> 20:10.405
First, there was Julia,
then me, my family,

20:10.440 --> 20:12.329
and now you.

20:12.370 --> 20:13.735
- Emily, he's my husband.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.339
- He took your life!

20:15.380 --> 20:17.474
He was selfish,
got too close,

20:17.510 --> 20:19.672
and now, he stole your future.

20:19.710 --> 20:20.916
He's only getting worse.

20:22.850 --> 20:26.343
- We're undead! We
don't have a soul!

20:26.390 --> 20:28.688
- Not in the literal sense.
- No, no!

20:28.720 --> 20:30.859
When a vampire
dies an absolute death,

20:30.890 --> 20:32.358
there is nothing.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.494
It's why we
fight the end

20:33.530 --> 20:34.895
with everything
that we have.

20:34.930 --> 20:37.820
It's why-- It's why I haven't
had the strength to--

20:37.870 --> 20:41.329
- I know, when the virus
first affected me,

20:41.370 --> 20:44.010
I thought about it too, putting
an end to the suffering,

20:44.040 --> 20:45.007
but I couldn't.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.462
- Yeah, right? Exactly.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.729
It's against our nature.
But Henry, I--I don't...

20:48.780 --> 20:52.899
- But now you know that
there is an afterlife,

20:52.950 --> 20:54.918
even for us.

20:54.950 --> 20:57.612
I know how you suffered.

20:57.650 --> 21:00.358
I've watched you
for almost a century.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.625
Aidan, join me.

21:03.660 --> 21:07.528
Prove that you are strong,
and you will be free...

21:09.030 --> 21:10.759
of all of it.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.396
- You could always see me?

21:14.440 --> 21:17.808
- Some humans are more
open-minded than others.

21:17.840 --> 21:21.401
- I'm sorry.
You and Aidan broke up!

21:21.440 --> 21:24.944
- I've always known that
there was something going on

21:24.980 --> 21:26.379
between you two.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.947
- Well, no, there wasn't.

21:28.980 --> 21:32.939
I mean, yeah, there were,
like, feelings, and...

21:32.990 --> 21:33.957
(Chuckling)

21:33.990 --> 21:35.685
There was something, but...

21:35.720 --> 21:39.054
- How do you think this little
love story is gonna turn out?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.957
A zombie and a vampire,
now, that's tricky enough,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.527
but you sort of missed
that brief, corporeal window.

21:47.870 --> 21:50.805
- I know about the wolf,

21:50.840 --> 21:52.808
that he's taken you.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.832
- No. No, that's not true.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.440
I have control
over it now.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.973
- Josh, you gotta stop
lying to yourself,

22:02.020 --> 22:05.581
You murdered a group of
people just a few days ago.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.384
You brutally
eviscerated them!

22:07.420 --> 22:09.411
- You think
I don't remember that?

22:09.460 --> 22:11.724
- I think you don't
care, not really.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.558
I think that there's
no trace left

22:13.600 --> 22:14.999
of the man I fell
in love with.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.727
- I will never forget what
I did to those people.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.864
- I know what it's like,

22:19.900 --> 22:22.562
to see the wolf
take you over.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.602
- No, the eclipse,
that was different.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.007
I couldn't control myself.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.008
- No, you couldn't.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.101
- Tell me, please,
do I hurt someone?

22:32.150 --> 22:34.619
Do I hurt--
Do I hurt Nora?

22:34.650 --> 22:37.540
- I told you,
not until it's time.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.888
- So what do I do?
How do I keep her safe?

22:39.920 --> 22:42.480
- You need to
take your life.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.359
Take it to save hers.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.569
To those people.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.432
- No, you don't understand.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.097
He's got it under control now.

22:57.140 --> 22:59.632
He's working so hard.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.900
- I know you're afraid
of him too. I can feel it.

23:01.940 --> 23:03.476
What if I told you

23:03.510 --> 23:06.707
that you could find out
everything he's really thinking?

23:06.750 --> 23:09.640
Everything he's
hiding from you.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.184
- No, he doesn't
write in there anymore.

23:13.220 --> 23:15.188
He hasn't for a long time.

23:15.220 --> 23:19.020
- Really, 'cause that's
from this week.

23:20.930 --> 23:24.389
You tell me if that sounds
like a man in control.

23:26.930 --> 23:29.695
- You guys can't
even touch each other!

23:31.710 --> 23:35.601
Aidan and I, well, we did
quite a bit of touching.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.177
- As much as I love this
girl talk, I'm just gonna go.

23:39.910 --> 23:43.881
- Aidan told me he'd never been
with anyone like me.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.742
Those kind of feelings
don't just go away.

23:46.790 --> 23:49.009
- What are you
trying to say, Kat?

23:49.060 --> 23:51.654
- He doesn't love you.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.795
Why else would I be
in this house?

24:00.270 --> 24:02.693
- Why are you
doing this, Ramona?

24:05.840 --> 24:07.501
Where are my friends?

24:07.540 --> 24:09.929
What are you doing
with my friends, Ramona?

24:09.980 --> 24:11.903
- He doesn't love you, Sally!

24:11.950 --> 24:13.770
- Ramona!

24:13.820 --> 24:15.777
Ramona, please!

24:15.820 --> 24:18.642
Why are you doing this?
I've been trying to help you!

24:24.090 --> 24:27.025
You think you can pull
this crap on another ghost?

24:28.700 --> 24:30.566
I'm more powerful
than you,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.227
and you know it.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.830
- You still think
I'm a ghost.

24:34.870 --> 24:37.703
You didn't play the game.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.506
All the others
wanted to play.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.847
I thought we were friends.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.144
- Yeah, well, all that
went out the window

24:49.180 --> 24:51.888
when I watched you
kill a blood relative.

24:53.790 --> 24:57.988
- Please, Sally.
Please stay.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.624
- Yeah, not a chance
in hell, kid!

25:00.660 --> 25:02.298
We're all leaving,

25:02.330 --> 25:06.597
especially now with this new
Carol Anne crap you're pulling.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.907
- Doesn't matter,
not really.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.602
None of you
have a choice.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.671
I'm not just in
this house, Sally.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.679
I am this house.

25:27.790 --> 25:30.259
- You have to do this.
You know it's your destiny.

25:30.290 --> 25:33.123
- I can still make
a difference.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.855
- Don't you think it's time

25:34.900 --> 25:37.926
to retire the "reluctant vampire
with a heart of gold" act?

25:37.970 --> 25:39.119
You must know by now

25:39.170 --> 25:41.867
that all you bring
to this world is misery.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.210
- Not to everyone.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.766
- Well, let's see.

25:46.810 --> 25:51.680
To multitudes of strangers,
innocents around the globe,

25:51.710 --> 25:53.815
to your own offspring.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.318
(Sighing)

25:55.350 --> 25:59.082
To every woman you have
claimed you've ever loved.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.054
- I've tried, Henry!

26:01.090 --> 26:03.923
You, of all people,
you know that I've tried!

26:03.960 --> 26:07.157
- And when's the last time
you've slipped up?

26:08.260 --> 26:10.319
Right?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.021
(Crying)

26:12.070 --> 26:15.165
But now you know there's
something beyond this world.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.635
(Chuckling)

26:17.670 --> 26:18.899
That's why I came.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.072
If you could
take it all back,

26:23.110 --> 26:25.044
save them, all of them,
wouldn't you?

26:25.080 --> 26:27.048
- Yes. Yes, I would,
absolutely.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.309
You know that, Henry.

26:28.350 --> 26:30.842
- Then the next best thing
is to save those

26:30.890 --> 26:32.745
who have yet
to die by your hand.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.321
- You think I wanted this?

26:45.370 --> 26:48.192
I had no choice over what
happened to me that night!

26:48.240 --> 26:49.867
- I am dead
because of you.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.302
You destroy everything
and everyone you touch!

26:56.240 --> 26:58.948
But you can change that.

27:08.390 --> 27:11.280
Pick up the knife
and end it, Josh.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.389
Nora will move on.

27:13.430 --> 27:16.957
Pick up the knife
and save her.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.059
(Sighing)

27:35.050 --> 27:37.178
- This isn't my destiny.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.382
Nora is.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.858
No! No!

27:42.890 --> 27:45.257
- "The rage grows everyday.

27:45.290 --> 27:49.727
"I try to push it down and focus
on everything good in my life,

27:49.760 --> 27:55.062
"but there are moments,
too many, where it takes over,

27:55.100 --> 27:57.398
"and I'm not myself.

27:57.440 --> 28:02.435
"I'm only anger, and the urge
to kill becomes a need."

28:02.480 --> 28:04.278
(Whispering): Josh!

28:05.480 --> 28:08.415
No, I can't read any more.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.909
- We need to stop him
from killing again.

28:11.950 --> 28:13.418
- I made a promise.

28:13.450 --> 28:16.420
I signed up for all of it,
for life.

28:16.460 --> 28:20.419
- I love him, too, Nora,
but my brother is a murderer.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.950
Can you honestly tell me

28:22.000 --> 28:24.298
that you feel safe
for a few days,

28:24.330 --> 28:25.798
let alone a lifetime?

28:28.000 --> 28:32.210
And what about what's
growing inside you?

28:32.240 --> 28:35.801
Do you really think
you can protect your baby?

28:35.840 --> 28:38.172
- How did you know?
- It doesn't matter.

28:38.210 --> 28:41.316
But now you understand that
I'm trying to protect you both.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.239
That baby is my family too.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.911
- After you died,
the boys moved in.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.450
(Chuckling)

28:50.490 --> 28:53.357
A vampire and a werewolf,

28:53.390 --> 28:54.789
(Chuckling)

28:54.830 --> 28:56.355
The carnage jackpot.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.791
And the longer they stay,
the more bodies keep piling up.

28:59.830 --> 29:05.530
I mean, this week alone has been
like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

29:05.570 --> 29:10.872
So now you see why
I couldn't just let you leave,

29:10.910 --> 29:13.550
why I had to fight for you.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.242
- You killed my brother.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.248
- I so hate change.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.952
Unfortunately,
I've had to accept

29:20.990 --> 29:23.413
that all good things
must come to an end.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.950
- Because now we're leaving,

29:24.990 --> 29:27.425
and because there's nothing
you can do to stop us.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.500
- I do hope you'll reconsider.

29:31.530 --> 29:34.500
The spectral company
is a comfort,

29:34.540 --> 29:37.908
but the others,

29:37.940 --> 29:41.035
I mean, if they
plan on leaving,

29:41.080 --> 29:44.402
I'll have to take my blood
where I can get it.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.100
- You're gonna
kill them.

29:47.550 --> 29:51.418
- Sally, they're
as good as dead.

29:51.450 --> 29:54.090
(Breathing unevenly)

29:58.260 --> 30:02.493
Um, where you are now,
is it any easier?

30:03.930 --> 30:06.160
- I can feel the sun.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.760
You can be with Sally.

30:15.910 --> 30:19.073
I know how you
feel about her.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.909
This is the only way.

30:23.920 --> 30:28.312
You can be with
Sally forever.

30:40.530 --> 30:41.895
Good.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.931
(Exhaling sharply)

30:45.170 --> 30:47.332
She'll be
waiting for you.

30:47.370 --> 30:48.576
(Exhaling sharply)

30:51.510 --> 30:53.342
- OK.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.413
(Breathing unevenly)

31:05.490 --> 31:08.528
- Josh is gonna love this baby
with all of his heart.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.528
- Then why haven't
you told him?

31:10.560 --> 31:13.097
He essentially killed
your first child.

31:13.130 --> 31:16.236
I don't see why this one
should be any different.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.602
- (Sally): Nora.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.029
- (Whisperi ing): Sally! 9

31:21.080 --> 31:22.229
- She can't help you.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.634
- How long have
you been here?

31:23.680 --> 31:26.342
- Nora, whatever you think
is happening right now,

31:26.380 --> 31:28.474
whatever you think
you see, it's not real.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.340
- Don't listen to her.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.541
- None of it's real.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.957
- She's right.
I have to protect the baby.

31:33.990 --> 31:35.617
- Nora, it's the
house right now.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.924
Nora, listen to me!
It's the house.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.088
It's getting in your head.
- The house?

31:40.130 --> 31:43.020
- You have to believe me.
You need to listen to me.

31:43.060 --> 31:45.666
- No, but Emily...
- Emily is not here!

31:45.700 --> 31:47.099
There's nobody here!

31:47.130 --> 31:48.291
Nora, Look at me. Yeah.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.195
Listen, listen.
Look at me.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.662
Look at Emily.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.930
- Sally, what's going on?

31:54.980 --> 31:56.129
- I know, I know, I know.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.239
Look, you need to
go find Josh right now.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.577
I'm gonna go
find Aidan, OK?

31:59.610 --> 32:01.419
- (Crying): What's
happening to me?

32:01.450 --> 32:03.111
- Now! They need
our help now!

32:03.150 --> 32:04.311
Go! Go!

32:04.350 --> 32:05.511
- OK.

32:05.550 --> 32:06.711
- Go.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.479
(Grunting)

32:08.520 --> 32:10.579
Aidan, stop!

32:10.620 --> 32:12.987
- Don't listen to her.
She's scared.

32:13.030 --> 32:15.397
It's only natural.
She'll get over it.

32:15.430 --> 32:18.730
- This is all for you.
We have a chance now.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.364
- Whatever it is
you think that you heard,

32:21.400 --> 32:24.006
whatever you're thinking,
it's all a lie.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.259
It's all a lie.

32:26.310 --> 32:29.075
I need you, OK? Please!

32:29.110 --> 32:30.475
Please?

32:30.510 --> 32:32.740
(Whispering):
Please don't leave me!

32:32.780 --> 32:35.317
Please don't leave me!

32:42.690 --> 32:44.579
(Sally sighing)

32:51.070 --> 32:54.392
- All right, what the hell
is happening to me?

32:57.500 --> 32:59.207
(Sighing)

33:02.040 --> 33:04.407
(Breathing unevenly)

33:08.550 --> 33:10.416
- (Sobbing): Oh no!

33:11.650 --> 33:15.154
NO, NO, NO, NO!

33:17.690 --> 33:20.751
(Sobbing):
No, no, no...

33:22.760 --> 33:25.320
Oh God! Oh God!

33:25.370 --> 33:27.190
Oh, Nora!

33:32.670 --> 33:34.729
(Whispering): Oh God!

33:34.780 --> 33:36.202
She was right.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.641
All this death,

33:38.680 --> 33:40.444
it was always me.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.812
Oh, I'm so sorry!

33:45.850 --> 33:50.515
I'm O M SO SO S o S
I'm rry s! o Is' O r ry I u r ry !

33:50.560 --> 33:54.190
I'm so sorry, baby!
I love you so much!

33:54.230 --> 33:57.530
I should've done this
a long time ago.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.690
I love you. I love you!

34:01.740 --> 34:03.538
- (Nora): Josh?

34:03.570 --> 34:06.164
Josh, what are you doing?
Stop it!

34:06.210 --> 34:08.268
What's going on?
- No! No! Oh my God!

34:08.310 --> 34:10.699
- Stop! Put the knife down.
- I'm so sorry!

34:10.739 --> 34:14.119
- Don't be sorry! Whatever you
think is happening is not real.

34:14.150 --> 34:15.275
- It's all my fault!

34:15.320 --> 34:16.446
- Put down the knife!

34:16.480 --> 34:18.244
Please look at me!
Look at me!

34:18.290 --> 34:19.746
I'm here!
I'm here!

34:19.790 --> 34:21.382
I'm here! Please!

34:23.460 --> 34:25.428
Please!
It's gonna be OK.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.656
I'm here.
We're gonna be OK.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.523
Just put down
the knife, please.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.789
- You're not a ghost!

34:31.830 --> 34:34.629
- All of us
are gonna be OK.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.138
(Sobbing)

34:36.170 --> 34:37.331
- Josh!

34:37.370 --> 34:38.337
- You OK?

34:38.370 --> 34:39.565
- We gotta go.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.271
- Let's go!

34:41.310 --> 34:44.768
OK, T'll explain that later.
We need to get out of here now!

34:44.810 --> 34:46.277
Come on, everybody.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.744
Aidan, come on!

34:47.780 --> 34:50.545
- (Aidan): Wait!
Just hold on for a second!

34:52.219 --> 34:54.210
(All panting)

34:54.260 --> 34:55.409
- (Nora):
Oh my God!

34:55.460 --> 34:56.859
- Oh, zero improvement!

34:56.889 --> 34:59.484
- What is going on?
- Do you see what's happening?

34:59.530 --> 35:01.851
Every door we go through
leads to the wrong room.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.425
This wall is
now sealed up

35:03.460 --> 35:06.464
after a giant,
sledgehammered hole was in it

35:06.500 --> 35:07.467
10 minutes ago.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.763
It's the house!

35:08.800 --> 35:10.859
- What the hell are
you saying? What?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.608
- Why don't you shut up
and let her explain, Aidan?

35:14.840 --> 35:18.470
- Guys, Ramona's
not a ghost.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.850
She's the evil of
this house, personified,

35:22.880 --> 35:25.781
and she's not
letting us out alive.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.380
- That's the
condensed version,

35:28.420 --> 35:30.354
but I can tell
you all get the gist.

35:30.390 --> 35:32.529
- You know what, Ramona?
You lose, though,

35:32.560 --> 35:34.324
because nobody here
offed themselves,

35:34.360 --> 35:35.521
nobody killed each other.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.358
Our bond is
stronger than you.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.597
So I guess you didn't really
think about that, did you?

35:40.630 --> 35:42.359
- I have time.

35:45.940 --> 35:50.207
Look at that.
Soon enough, I'll have help.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.901
- Aidan?

35:54.350 --> 35:55.442
Aidan, it's me!

35:55.480 --> 35:56.948
- How the hell
did he get in here?

35:56.980 --> 35:58.379
- Open that wall.

35:58.420 --> 35:59.910
You open that wall
right now!

35:59.950 --> 36:01.759
(Wall crackling)

36:01.790 --> 36:03.189
- Wait!

36:03.220 --> 36:05.450
(Scoffing)

36:05.490 --> 36:06.753
Aidan, wait. Don't!

36:06.790 --> 36:09.350
- (Josh):
Hey! No!

36:09.400 --> 36:11.220
No!

36:11.270 --> 36:13.261
(Josh grunting)

36:13.300 --> 36:14.961
- Hey, pal! I said
I'd help you out,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.367
but now is not
exactly the best time.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.506
- Stop it. I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.201
Tell me the truth.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.799
- The truth?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.945
Buddy, I don't
want any secrets.

36:25.980 --> 36:27.948
- Stop lying!

36:29.320 --> 36:30.810
I know Josh killed her,

36:30.850 --> 36:33.342
so stop lying to me for once.

36:33.390 --> 36:36.212
- OK, Kenny, please,
just listen to me for a second.

36:36.260 --> 36:39.525
- What? What could you possibly
say to me right now, huh?

36:39.560 --> 36:40.857
I have been
listening to you.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.551
I followed you,
and I trusted you

36:42.600 --> 36:45.968
and you told me that there was
a special bond between us.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.593
You remember that?

36:47.630 --> 36:49.337
- Yeah, and I meant that.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.805
What happened to Astrid,
I'm heartbroken. I really am.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.502
And I wanted to tell you,
but I was scared.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.599
I was scared of
how you would react.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.301
I was scared of this.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.478
I was scared that
it would come between us.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.319
- Josh is what's between us,

37:02.350 --> 37:04.489
and you choose him
again and again.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.340
- I would never
choose Josh.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.539
Look, what Josh did...

37:07.590 --> 37:08.557
(Sighing)

37:08.590 --> 37:09.853
...that's not who he is.

37:09.890 --> 37:12.621
He regrets it, and he's
gonna carry that guilt

37:12.660 --> 37:14.025
for the rest of his life.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.757
- I don't care. That's not
good enough for Astrid.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.269
- Maybe not.

37:20.600 --> 37:24.707
But what good is gonna
come of this, huh?

37:24.740 --> 37:28.904
Look, I already told you
that revenge is--

37:28.940 --> 37:30.931
- Is what she deserves.
I know.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.474
I loved her.

37:34.520 --> 37:38.548
And unlike you, I honour
the people that I love.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.452
But first I have to kill you,

37:47.490 --> 37:51.996
so I don't have to hear another
lie come out of your mouth.

37:52.030 --> 37:53.520
- You don't wanna do that.

37:53.570 --> 37:55.459
And this is gonna sound crazy,

37:55.500 --> 37:58.504
but I gotta get you out
of this house right now!

37:58.540 --> 38:00.360
- We have to do something.

38:00.410 --> 38:02.799
You should be able
to get out of here, right?

38:02.840 --> 38:05.343
- I can't!
Her control is beyond me.

38:05.380 --> 38:06.541
I can't get in or out.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.639
Why would you do this?

38:08.680 --> 38:12.014
Why would you let Kenny in?
What purpose does he serve?

38:12.050 --> 38:14.849
- You killed Bishop,
got your vengeance.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.051
(Sighing)

38:16.090 --> 38:17.683
Now's my turn.

38:17.720 --> 38:21.395
Circle of life
or something, huh?

38:22.630 --> 38:24.325
- It's happening,

38:24.370 --> 38:26.395
just as it was meant to.

38:26.430 --> 38:30.389
One by one,
you will all fall.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.807
- Aidan!
- Baby, hold on!

38:34.140 --> 38:37.007
- Wait a sec.
Did you call her "baby"?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.805
Ah, we have
something in common.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.818
We both love
dead girls.

38:41.850 --> 38:43.079
- Hold on, hold on!

38:43.120 --> 38:45.088
(Both grunting)

38:45.120 --> 38:46.417
(Aidan groaning)

38:55.560 --> 38:58.325
(Both grunting)

39:00.870 --> 39:04.761
- Admit it! Admit that you were
never a true father to me!

39:04.810 --> 39:06.835
(Groaning)

39:09.710 --> 39:10.905
Admit it!

39:10.940 --> 39:12.044
(Both grunting)

39:16.550 --> 39:18.040
(Aidan groaning)

39:19.950 --> 39:23.079
Don't you see?
This is why I did this!

39:23.120 --> 39:24.656
I did this for you!

39:24.690 --> 39:26.852
I rebuilt this town for you.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.661
(Both grunting)

39:46.610 --> 39:48.544
- (Whispering):
Oh my God!

39:48.580 --> 39:50.674
Hey, no, no, no!
Don't move, don't move!

39:50.720 --> 39:52.085
Look at me, look at me.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.884
Just stay calm.
All right?

39:53.920 --> 39:55.456
(Exhaling sharply)

39:55.490 --> 39:56.685
Um...

39:56.720 --> 39:58.154
- (Whispering):
Oh, this is it.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.487
- No, no, no.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.556
Everything's OK.
Everything's OK.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.160
- No, no.
This is OK.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.431
I was ready for this.
I have been.

40:08.470 --> 40:10.564
- No, no, no.
We're gonna fix this.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.704
Trust me! Trust me!

40:11.740 --> 40:13.105
- Shhh! It's OK.

40:13.140 --> 40:16.110
I mean, I got to live a lot
longer than I was meant to,

40:16.140 --> 40:18.848
and I got to be with
a beautiful girl

40:18.880 --> 40:20.848
even for the
blink of an eye.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.714
But it happened, and it's
always going to have happened.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.980
(Gulping)

40:27.020 --> 40:28.909
- Listen, just don't
move, all right?

40:28.960 --> 40:31.110
I've--I've been
through worse, believe me.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.855
All right?
We're gonna fix this.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.154
- Guess we have something
else in common now.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.929
Sally's gone.

40:39.030 --> 40:41.192
She's gone.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.460
- What?

40:44.510 --> 40:46.205
- Sally's...
- No, she's not.

40:46.240 --> 40:49.870
- No, she is. Sally's gone,
and Josh destroyed her.

40:51.910 --> 40:55.642
He ruined the one good--
the one good thing that you had.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.671
This is what he does.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.109
This is all Josh's fault.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.951
It's all Josh's fault.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.751
- Oh!

41:08.800 --> 41:10.655
(Stake clattering)

41:22.240 --> 41:23.708
(Whimpering)

41:25.250 --> 41:27.901
(Aidan sobbing)

41:30.620 --> 41:32.110
Oh God!

41:32.150 --> 41:33.686
- Guys.

41:38.090 --> 41:40.024
- By all means,
join him.

41:43.260 --> 41:45.820
(Aidan sobbing)

42:01.620 --> 42:03.748
- I lied for you.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.680
- Aidan.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.212
- And now my son is dead.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.150
And Sally!

42:10.190 --> 42:11.726
- Aidan!

42:13.990 --> 42:16.698
- It was the one thing

42:16.730 --> 42:19.028
that gave me any hope!

42:19.070 --> 42:20.822
- (Donna):
When I send you forward,

42:20.870 --> 42:23.840
you may bounce around in time
a little bit first.

42:23.870 --> 42:26.840
- It was the one thing
that gave me any hope!

42:26.870 --> 42:28.304
- Josh! Hey!

42:28.340 --> 42:31.310
- I know you're confused,
but I can explain this, pal.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.603
- This is on you.

42:32.650 --> 42:33.879
- No.

42:33.910 --> 42:35.719
Aidan, no.
Don't do this!

42:35.750 --> 42:37.969
Back up right now!
- I can explain this.

42:38.020 --> 42:39.715
- This is on you.
- STOP!

43:00.770 --> 43:00.838
