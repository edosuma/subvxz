00:15.358 --> 00:16.860
(Dogs yapping)

00:25.493 --> 00:27.245
(Dogs yapping in distance)

00:45.054 --> 00:48.016
(Kublai) Amends must be made
for your father's crime.

00:48.099 --> 00:49.267
(Marco)
I understand.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.189
(Dogs barking)

01:02.613 --> 01:04.572
(Horses whinnying in distance)

01:10.704 --> 01:12.498
(Whinnying continues)

01:38.816 --> 01:40.276
(Clattering)

01:44.113 --> 01:46.824
(Kublai) Left to my vice regent, Yusuf,
or myself,

01:46.908 --> 01:49.743
your father's punishment
would be certain.

01:49.827 --> 01:52.330
His thief heart would now be still.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.252
I know the pain
this would cause you.

02:04.133 --> 02:06.719
(Kublai)
I know compassion.

02:06.802 --> 02:09.597
And you know our customs.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.224
Khagan's law.

02:11.307 --> 02:14.352
You will choose
your father's punishment.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.562
And then you shall find sleep.

02:19.941 --> 02:21.025
(Kublai groans)

02:51.055 --> 02:52.556
(Choking)

02:56.602 --> 02:57.853
(Screaming)

03:14.037 --> 03:15.579
(Coughing weakly)

03:51.907 --> 03:52.991
Don't kill him!

03:53.076 --> 03:55.744
We must find out who he serves.

03:57.288 --> 03:58.497
(Screams)

04:23.106 --> 04:25.108
(Theme music playing)

06:15.676 --> 06:18.053
(Jingim)
How is he?

06:18.136 --> 06:20.013
Poison of the yellow scorpion.

06:20.097 --> 06:23.141
The healers do not know if he
will survive the night.

06:23.226 --> 06:26.770
- How many assassins?
- Three.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.648
Where were his knights?

06:29.732 --> 06:31.525
Many fell this evening, Jingim.

06:31.609 --> 06:33.110
Against three assassins?

06:38.324 --> 06:40.951
I will convene the war assembly.

06:48.125 --> 06:52.421
Our Great Khan wavers
between this life and the next...

06:52.505 --> 06:54.089
and we stand here...

06:54.172 --> 06:57.301
violated within our own walls
and wonder whether we should avenge.

06:57.385 --> 07:00.679
We do not yet know
who violated us.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.807
(Ahmad) Is there anyone here
aside from my friend Yusuf who cannot...

07:03.891 --> 07:07.853
(Yusuf) You overstep your office...
my Minister of Finance.

07:07.936 --> 07:10.481
(Jingim) Our Lord battles
the coward's poison.

07:12.858 --> 07:14.568
I say this...

07:14.652 --> 07:19.114
I shall stand for him...
as he has for each of you.

07:19.197 --> 07:20.616
(Ahmad)
Prince...

07:20.699 --> 07:24.077
we do not know if this
is the tip of Sidao's sword.

07:24.161 --> 07:27.581
At this very moment, his army
could be descending upon us.

07:27.665 --> 07:32.210
(Yusuf) We have received
no notice from our outposts

07:32.295 --> 07:34.713
of any upcoming armies.

07:34.797 --> 07:37.215
Well, perhaps
they have been eliminated.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.634
(Court murmuring assent)

07:41.053 --> 07:45.724
Thousands of imperial guards...
Mongol knights...

07:45.808 --> 07:47.976
a moat, deep and wide,

07:48.060 --> 07:51.188
dogs... walls!

07:51.272 --> 07:55.025
How did this scum
penetrate our defenses?

07:57.194 --> 08:00.489
Walls and guards,
dogs and moats.

08:00.573 --> 08:01.615
Prince...

08:01.699 --> 08:06.244
the answer to the assassins' identity
rests in your question.

08:07.496 --> 08:10.833
They moved underwater
and through walls...

08:10.916 --> 08:14.670
sensed only by the Khan's horses.

08:14.753 --> 08:18.799
Their tools were
climbing hook and shadow.

08:18.882 --> 08:24.096
These demons were trained
by the Old Man in the Mountain.

08:24.179 --> 08:26.223
They were Hashshashin.

08:27.308 --> 08:28.309
(Court murmuring)

08:31.520 --> 08:33.063
The Hashshashin...

08:33.145 --> 08:37.400
were crushed by my uncle Hülegü
long before my birth.

08:37.485 --> 08:38.736
The Old Man and his martyrs

08:38.818 --> 08:42.865
are nothing more than phantoms and fables
told to frighten children!

08:42.948 --> 08:47.370
If they were not Hashshashin,
they were trained in their ways.

08:47.453 --> 08:52.500
Yusuf is correct in his counsel.
These men are mercenaries.

08:52.583 --> 08:56.128
They could have been hired
by anyone for any reason.

08:56.211 --> 09:00.508
Do you advise
I send warriors in search of a myth

09:00.591 --> 09:04.637
when our true and very real enemy
lies in Xiangyang?

09:04.720 --> 09:08.766
I suggest you open your eyes
to the possibility...

09:08.849 --> 09:11.226
as your father would.

09:11.309 --> 09:13.812
How many of our guards were slain?

09:13.896 --> 09:17.274
Can we afford not to search out
such a potent adversary?

09:17.358 --> 09:21.987
We can, blind man...
because the Old Man is dead!

09:22.070 --> 09:24.322
Our demons lie south!

09:24.407 --> 09:26.909
(Marco)
With deference, Prince Jingim...

09:28.243 --> 09:30.328
that may not be true.

09:30.413 --> 09:33.957
Who allowed you access
to this assembly, Latin?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.959
Jingim.

09:39.797 --> 09:41.173
Speak.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.259
On my journey to Cambulac,

09:44.342 --> 09:46.387
I passed a village
two weeks ride from here

09:46.470 --> 09:48.221
named Kochkor.

09:48.305 --> 09:52.184
My guide...
told of a lone way station.

09:52.267 --> 09:55.020
He was clear that those who
speak the name of Hashshashin...

09:55.103 --> 09:57.398
were offering their heads
to these assassins

09:57.481 --> 09:59.733
who are very much alive.

09:59.817 --> 10:01.569
What is your point?

10:01.652 --> 10:05.698
If this was the Hashshashin...
we will find them there.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.452
You say you know
where this place rests?

10:09.535 --> 10:11.161
(Marco)
I do.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.413
Byamba...

10:12.496 --> 10:15.749
you will ride there with a company
under the banner of the Khan.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.001
If Master Polo is correct...

10:18.085 --> 10:21.922
track the assassins and confirm
the Song rebels' complicity.

10:22.005 --> 10:25.468
In this answer,
the scale of war will be balanced.

10:32.516 --> 10:35.393
Steady your heart, Marco.
You are of...

10:43.819 --> 10:45.613
Prince Jingim!

10:48.782 --> 10:51.034
If a band of Mongolian soldiers
travel as they are,

10:51.118 --> 10:53.328
the Hashshashin will see danger...

10:53.411 --> 10:58.291
but... if they ride as escorts
for a merchant searching for poppy,

10:58.375 --> 11:01.795
the flower by which the Hashshashin
are said to draw their strength...

11:01.879 --> 11:03.506
It might play a helpful ruse.

11:03.589 --> 11:07.843
And you, Polo, might get sliced
into fine white meat in the process.

11:08.844 --> 11:10.554
Prepare your horse.

11:10.638 --> 11:12.347
Prince...

11:12.430 --> 11:14.933
the Khan and I came to terms
before the attack.

11:15.017 --> 11:18.812
My father and uncle are to be spared.
I beg you to heed...

11:18.896 --> 11:23.692
Tonight... your father and uncle
are the least of my concerns.

11:23.776 --> 11:26.862
I make no promises for tomorrow.

11:33.536 --> 11:35.871
(Za Bing) An attempt has been made
on the Khan's life.

11:38.081 --> 11:42.377
- Is he alive?
- Some say yes. Some no.

11:42.460 --> 11:46.173
A party rides
to find those responsible.

11:46.256 --> 11:49.760
Master Polo is among them.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.598
(Hundred Eyes) I have taught you
to blend with every attack.

11:54.682 --> 11:56.183
Absorb your opponent.

11:56.266 --> 11:59.562
- When water is poured into a vessel...
- It becomes the vessel.

11:59.645 --> 12:03.607
But the Hashshashin
are not common warriors.

12:03.691 --> 12:09.196
The Old Man trains them to enter
the shadow- self, the demon- self.

12:09.279 --> 12:12.282
That is their art.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.993
How does one
absorb such darkness

12:15.077 --> 12:17.913
and yet return to the light?

12:17.996 --> 12:21.166
Especially one unsure
of his place in the world?

12:22.585 --> 12:28.423
If you seek and find the assassins,
you will need to become the vessel.

12:28.506 --> 12:32.678
If you don't go deep enough,
they will smell you and kill you.

12:33.596 --> 12:35.430
Go too deep...

12:35.513 --> 12:38.892
and you will not return
from Eagle's Teaching.

12:38.976 --> 12:40.352
What marks the balance?

12:40.435 --> 12:43.355
Certainty of self.

12:44.022 --> 12:46.859
I do not go for myself, Sifu.

12:46.942 --> 12:48.235
I go for my father.

12:50.528 --> 12:52.865
Ride beneath the skyline.

12:52.948 --> 12:54.908
The Hashshashin
do not wish to be found.

12:54.992 --> 12:58.328
They will find you.

13:06.461 --> 13:09.547
(Za Bing) Master Marco...
a moment, please.

13:28.025 --> 13:32.821
Byamba will travel with a golden tablet.
All gates will open before you.

13:32.905 --> 13:34.406
Why are you telling me this?

13:34.489 --> 13:37.367
If the Lord Khan dies
while you're gone...

13:37.450 --> 13:39.494
so does your only advocate.

13:39.577 --> 13:42.039
Take this tragedy for what it is.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.833
Opportunity. Run.

14:19.242 --> 14:20.493
(Indistinct murmuring)

14:21.494 --> 14:23.205
(Jia Sidao)
This...

14:24.122 --> 14:27.542
is what happens when
we barter with barbarians.

14:27.625 --> 14:31.129
Cruelty must be met with cruelty.

14:31.213 --> 14:35.425
We must lay waste to their cities,
their women and children.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.847
We must drive them back into
the savage hole from which they slid.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.225
It is time for war.

14:44.893 --> 14:49.147
(Red Brow) The Emperor's army is yours
to do with as you please...

14:49.231 --> 14:51.233
my Chancellor.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.753
(Ahmad) You understand
it takes time to gather the troops,

15:10.836 --> 15:13.881
- to prepare for battle...
- Do you forget who I am?

15:16.133 --> 15:18.635
I humbly ask that you
give the order to mobilize.

15:22.139 --> 15:24.641
If you do not prepare to strike...

15:24.725 --> 15:27.435
worse... prepare to be struck.

15:27.519 --> 15:30.981
The Latin may prove Jia Sidao
innocent of the attempt.

15:38.363 --> 15:40.698
It may.

15:40.783 --> 15:43.493
Do you not find it odd, Prince...

15:43.576 --> 15:47.039
that Master Marco spoke so surely
of the assassins' whereabouts?

15:47.122 --> 15:49.207
So quick to return?

15:49.291 --> 15:51.877
He does so for the sake of
his own father's head.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.046
And that is my point.

15:54.129 --> 15:57.132
What would you not do
to realize the dreams of your father?

15:59.301 --> 16:00.718
Nothing.

16:00.803 --> 16:04.431
The Khan continues to embrace
this boy we know so little about.

16:05.390 --> 16:09.519
The West is not ignorant
to the Khan's designs.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.605
Would we not plant rot
within the foundation of their house

16:12.689 --> 16:14.732
and let it fester
and collapse upon itself?

16:14.817 --> 16:17.986
You think he travels
to cover transgressions?

16:20.322 --> 16:21.907
I don't know.

16:22.825 --> 16:24.910
Perhaps grief
invades my thoughts.

16:48.934 --> 16:53.355
(Byamba) Has anyone thanked you...
for saving my father's life?

16:55.273 --> 16:58.776
(Marco) Had you and Hundred Eyes
not arrived, the Khan would be dead...

16:58.861 --> 17:02.489
as would I.
So... my thanks to you.

17:03.949 --> 17:05.575
Jingim as Khan...

17:07.202 --> 17:11.123
- You believe he is not fit?
- I never said that.

17:11.205 --> 17:12.915
Do you?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.792
This is not my home.
I'm a guest.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.963
It's not my place to judge my host.

17:21.590 --> 17:23.218
(Byamba)
I hated these as a boy.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.929
Rotten, sour.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.597
My mother made me eat them.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.225
She said they kept me healthy.

17:30.308 --> 17:31.434
And now?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.603
A superstition before battle.

17:33.686 --> 17:37.649
Of course, she meant
they were good for my teeth.

17:37.732 --> 17:40.360
Were you close to her?

17:40.443 --> 17:41.819
(Byamba)
I had to be.

17:41.904 --> 17:45.407
Son of a consort
is never fully accepted in court.

17:45.490 --> 17:48.826
Will they let me spill blood
on the battlefield? Yes.

17:51.413 --> 17:52.622
You?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.917
Were you close to your mother?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.252
She died when I was young.

17:57.335 --> 17:59.754
I was raised by my aunt.

17:59.837 --> 18:02.840
I didn't know my father
until three years ago.

18:04.426 --> 18:06.678
Son of an adventurer.

18:08.263 --> 18:11.433
Fathers are destined to disappoint sons,
and sons, their fathers.

18:11.516 --> 18:13.435
The Khan has disappointed you?

18:14.061 --> 18:16.729
I'm able to find the difference
between the Khan and the man.

18:18.065 --> 18:19.524
Didn't know that was allowed.

18:20.442 --> 18:22.194
What is locked behind
the doors of the heart

18:22.277 --> 18:23.987
is no one's business
but one's own.

18:24.071 --> 18:26.448
So, let's talk about the man,
and not the Khan.

18:26.531 --> 18:28.450
Make no mistake...

18:28.533 --> 18:32.204
even if we meet under the Blue Sky,
I will never open those doors to you.

18:33.205 --> 18:35.415
And I would never knock.

18:36.541 --> 18:39.086
You think by doing this,
you can save your father's life?

18:40.963 --> 18:43.340
I avenge the Khan
and hope he shows him favor.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.302
The point of all this was to thank you.

18:47.385 --> 18:50.430
So... thank you.

20:01.376 --> 20:03.878
Ride swift. Sidao must know.

20:03.961 --> 20:07.590
If he does not know that already.
Have you not considered that?

20:10.260 --> 20:13.971
The Mongols will look for spies now,
seek out conspirators.

20:14.056 --> 20:18.226
You must escape.
Deliver this message yourself.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.855
If Sidao did not
give the command...

20:22.939 --> 20:24.982
I must stay.

20:25.067 --> 20:28.320
My daughter lives or dies
by my decision.

20:28.403 --> 20:29.904
I remain.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.526
(Yusuf)
Who hired you to kill the Khan?

21:08.610 --> 21:10.987
I am destined for Paradise.

21:11.071 --> 21:14.574
That is all I know
and all I will ever claim to know.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.086
(Groaning)

21:26.169 --> 21:28.671
You don't want to do that.

21:30.382 --> 21:33.760
If you scream...
you tear your mouth.

21:35.178 --> 21:38.890
And the more you scream...
the more damage you do to yourself.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.769
Who hired you?

21:42.852 --> 21:46.273
I am destined for Paradise.

21:46.356 --> 21:50.860
That is all I know
and all I will ever claim to know.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.279
(Yusuf)
Very well.

21:54.281 --> 21:55.573
(Jingim)
Anything?

21:56.616 --> 21:59.286
(Sighing)
He may know nothing.

22:01.204 --> 22:03.165
May know nothing
or knows nothing?

22:04.081 --> 22:05.292
May.

22:05.375 --> 22:09.879
Then flay the skin from his bones
until you know.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.312
You heard the Prince.

22:25.395 --> 22:30.525
Let us announce to Paradise...
your pending arrival.

22:34.779 --> 22:36.198
(Screaming)

22:36.281 --> 22:38.157
(Screams echoing)

22:39.826 --> 22:41.077
(Door opening)

23:12.900 --> 23:15.695
How did you come to name your son?

23:16.404 --> 23:18.948
I did not name Marco.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.909
His mother had that honor.

23:21.993 --> 23:23.370
Why?

23:25.037 --> 23:27.874
I was not present at his birth.

23:27.957 --> 23:29.041
Where were you?

23:30.377 --> 23:33.045
In the world.

23:35.673 --> 23:39.176
So, you abandoned him
before he was even born?

23:41.220 --> 23:44.181
I was trying to make
a name for my family.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.894
Although I did not know him...

23:47.977 --> 23:50.897
everything I have done in my life
has been for him.

23:51.814 --> 23:55.109
I wanted the world
to know the Polo name.

23:55.192 --> 23:57.111
So, for legacy?

23:57.194 --> 23:59.155
Yes.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.615
(Jingim)
His legacy?

24:02.784 --> 24:04.243
Yes.

24:05.161 --> 24:07.955
Do you think
that is what he wanted?

24:08.039 --> 24:11.000
Do you think that was what
he needed from his father?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.794
Legacy?

24:12.877 --> 24:16.130
Do you know what your son
asked of me just before he left?

24:16.213 --> 24:19.133
"Keep them alive until I return.

24:19.216 --> 24:22.053
Keep them alive."

24:22.136 --> 24:23.930
Even after you
had abandoned him,

24:24.013 --> 24:25.682
after he could have died
for your transgressions,

24:25.765 --> 24:28.059
he was still concerned for you.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.229
What a fool.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.275
(Niccolò gasps)

24:40.905 --> 24:43.450
Never the matter.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.868
Marco will fall
and you with him.

25:31.038 --> 25:35.752
All right, my merchant friend.
Let us go peddle your wares.

25:36.878 --> 25:39.672
We ride below the skyline.

25:39.756 --> 25:43.259
That is not how we attract
the buyers we need.

25:55.772 --> 25:57.524
(Indistinct chatter)

26:08.826 --> 26:10.412
(Chatter ceases)

26:13.039 --> 26:14.331
(Greeting in Arabic)

26:29.847 --> 26:30.973
(Speaking English)
Done.

26:39.356 --> 26:43.152
The Chinese say...
"You can name a price for gold...

26:43.235 --> 26:47.657
but not for the white jade
from the Kingdom of Khotan."

26:49.576 --> 26:53.746
I do not lie when I say
it's the most precious of all gems...

26:53.830 --> 26:57.500
and sought by the imperial court.

26:57.584 --> 27:00.503
What do you wish for this...
white stone?

27:01.504 --> 27:05.341
The flower that
guides the way to Paradise.

27:07.134 --> 27:08.636
I wish to speak with the Old Man.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.316
(Byamba sighs)

27:22.399 --> 27:24.694
I guess we said something wrong.

27:45.715 --> 27:47.133
(Jingim)
Where are you?

27:47.216 --> 27:51.679
Wherever he has gone...
he will return.

28:06.068 --> 28:10.114
I realize now that I had no idea
the pressure one is under...

28:10.197 --> 28:12.408
turning a son into a man.

28:14.536 --> 28:17.914
Forget all the citizens in the realm.

28:17.997 --> 28:21.918
The responsibility parents have
for that one soul.

28:22.919 --> 28:26.005
It is a great challenge...

28:26.088 --> 28:29.091
and... a greater honor.

28:35.598 --> 28:37.684
You are so at peace.

28:39.268 --> 28:43.189
Peace is found
in the heart of the faithful.

28:43.940 --> 28:46.317
How can you be
so sure he will wake?

28:46.400 --> 28:50.530
My faith is rooted in what is next for him
should he not awaken.

28:50.613 --> 28:53.825
I think too much on this life, Mother...

28:53.908 --> 28:56.243
to consider what lies beyond.

29:15.638 --> 29:18.558
(Weeping softly)

29:28.525 --> 29:29.902
May I sit?

29:31.946 --> 29:33.615
If your intent is on trade.

29:33.698 --> 29:38.244
It remains unclaimed.
Perhaps your price is too high.

29:38.327 --> 29:42.081
Everything is open to barter.
What are you offering?

29:42.164 --> 29:44.208
Opportunity.

29:45.126 --> 29:46.127
For?

29:47.128 --> 29:50.297
Leaving through that door
still standing upright.

29:53.676 --> 29:56.012
And here I was
being so gracious.

29:56.095 --> 29:59.431
As am I.
I haven't leaned in yet.

29:59.974 --> 30:01.058
Who are you?

30:01.976 --> 30:04.353
There are two answers to that question.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.147
The first is...

30:06.230 --> 30:08.440
I am the owner of the chair
upon which you sit.

30:10.151 --> 30:11.360
And the second?

30:11.443 --> 30:14.781
The last face you will see
before descending into darkness.

30:18.034 --> 30:19.035
Look around you.

30:25.541 --> 30:26.668
Over the generations,

30:26.751 --> 30:31.088
these eaves have shielded the backs
of every culture known to man...

30:31.172 --> 30:35.134
and as such...
I know man...

30:35.217 --> 30:37.386
the strong and the weak,

30:37.469 --> 30:41.557
the bold and the cowardly,
the keen and the foolish...

30:41.641 --> 30:44.936
and you are strong... bold...

30:45.019 --> 30:49.398
and far from foolish enough
to track this trouble across my floor...

30:49.481 --> 30:53.235
unless you have convinced yourselves
through conditioning...

30:53.319 --> 30:55.529
that no harm will befall you.

30:57.114 --> 30:58.365
Show me.

31:08.584 --> 31:12.004
The Khan of Khans
grants the golden tablet to poppy dealers?

31:12.088 --> 31:13.589
No...

31:13.673 --> 31:16.718
a bureaucrat in the Secretariat
with a liking for hashish.

31:16.801 --> 31:19.095
I do not carry
the product you seek.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.931
(Scoffs)
Then what kind of seller are you?

31:23.099 --> 31:25.517
I am the man in the middle.

31:25.601 --> 31:27.937
We want the Gatekeeper of Paradise.

31:28.855 --> 31:31.023
That man...

31:31.107 --> 31:32.900
is far too deadly.

31:35.236 --> 31:36.570
Let us weigh the stakes.

31:38.447 --> 31:40.366
I misread you.

31:41.658 --> 31:43.327
You are a fool.

32:06.475 --> 32:07.977
(Knock on door)

32:12.398 --> 32:13.941
Continue.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.877
(Jingim)
Sidao slaughtered his ambassadors.

32:33.795 --> 32:34.796
My Prince?

32:34.879 --> 32:38.549
The Song ambassadors
we parleyed with...

32:38.632 --> 32:39.675
the warriors we freed,

32:39.759 --> 32:41.928
they were all butchered
returning to Xiangyang.

32:42.011 --> 32:46.348
Sidao lays the blame at our doorstep.
His army prepares for battle.

32:47.641 --> 32:49.936
Diplomacy is dead.

32:52.146 --> 32:54.523
You negotiated a true peace.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.983
Empress Dowager would've embraced it.

32:56.067 --> 32:59.695
Sidao has rejected our truce
with steel and blood.

33:01.322 --> 33:02.489
This is a good sign.

33:02.573 --> 33:04.033
Find for me the good in this.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.827
We have clarity of the inevitable.

33:05.910 --> 33:08.412
We know now
Xiangyang is divided.

33:08.495 --> 33:12.333
War is how this will end...
and now is a time to strike.

33:12.416 --> 33:15.086
We do not know
if Sidao moved against my father.

33:15.169 --> 33:17.629
We do not know if the Song
mobilize to attack or to defend.

33:17.713 --> 33:19.465
- We know nothing...
- (Ahmad) My Prince!

33:19.548 --> 33:23.677
My brother, yes, we need not march,
but... at least marshal our forces.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.679
We must prepare.

33:25.762 --> 33:28.349
In this, you must not fail.

33:28.432 --> 33:29.892
Gather your generals.

33:29.976 --> 33:31.102
Speak to them as warriors

33:31.185 --> 33:34.105
and they will follow you
past the gates of death.

33:34.188 --> 33:36.107
As they followed me at Wuchang?

33:36.190 --> 33:37.984
The army respects you.

33:38.067 --> 33:40.194
You attacked at Wuchang
against greater numbers.

33:40.277 --> 33:41.737
And I failed.

33:41.821 --> 33:44.781
But only while daring greatly.

33:44.866 --> 33:47.701
You advanced on a larger army
as Genghis would.

33:48.870 --> 33:51.413
Soldiers understand
losing is part of the journey...

33:51.497 --> 33:54.917
so long as their leader
does not believe it the destination.

33:55.001 --> 33:56.543
Your father understands this.

33:57.378 --> 33:58.712
He did not act as if he did.

33:58.795 --> 34:01.132
Would you have him savor defeat?

34:03.092 --> 34:05.511
No...

34:05.594 --> 34:08.097
but to speak as you do...

34:08.179 --> 34:09.473
once.

34:09.556 --> 34:11.808
He feels as I do...

34:11.893 --> 34:14.853
and he would say it now,
had he voice.

34:14.937 --> 34:17.731
Lend him your voice.

34:17.813 --> 34:22.152
Speak for Father now...
and command as Khan.

34:43.925 --> 34:46.717
(Byamba) Who is the
Old Man in the Mountain?

34:46.802 --> 34:49.972
(Sabbah) You certainly
are not fond of your throat, are you?

34:50.056 --> 34:52.474
You will not speak his name...

34:52.558 --> 34:57.313
and once I have taken you to him...
you will never return again.

34:57.396 --> 35:01.984
We have no reason to...
unless we are invited by you.

35:02.068 --> 35:03.485
(Sabbah laughs)

35:03.569 --> 35:05.779
You learn well, Europa.

35:10.284 --> 35:12.036
Which way?

35:12.119 --> 35:14.288
To Eagle's Teaching?

35:15.206 --> 35:18.625
One can only enter through Paradise.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.336
(Eagle screeching)

35:24.798 --> 35:26.550
(Sabbah)
A secret order

35:26.633 --> 35:29.595
formed at the time
of the First Crusade.

35:29.678 --> 35:32.473
The Old Man has
always lived among them...

35:32.556 --> 35:35.267
granting access to Paradise.

35:38.062 --> 35:39.771
Is he a magic man?

35:39.855 --> 35:41.482
He is a holy man.

35:41.565 --> 35:45.236
I think you trade
in black market fables.

35:45.319 --> 35:47.904
That's what I think.

35:47.989 --> 35:52.618
You have a much more genteel personality
than your friend.

35:52.701 --> 35:56.956
It takes time...
but he will soften... eventually.

35:57.039 --> 35:59.000
I will not.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.292
(Chuckles)

36:17.309 --> 36:19.395
Byamba, do you see?

36:26.735 --> 36:29.113
It is not the sun.

36:29.196 --> 36:34.785
It's a... golden passage...
into the heavens.

36:34.868 --> 36:38.205
Marvelous description.

36:50.092 --> 36:52.011
Are they watching us now?

36:52.094 --> 36:55.806
They have been watching you
since before we exchanged names.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.921
You are the Old Man.

40:15.005 --> 40:19.050
Some call me by that name, yes...

40:19.134 --> 40:24.515
but I've lived more lives
than any man under the sun...

40:24.598 --> 40:29.144
and will live many more
beyond this day.

40:29.228 --> 40:33.565
(Marco) And this... is a place
of hidden knowledge?

40:33.649 --> 40:37.444
(Old Man)
This is a place of freedom...

40:37.528 --> 40:42.491
where no one questions who you are,
where you come from,

40:42.574 --> 40:45.244
what tongue you speak.

40:45.327 --> 40:49.373
You are welcome as you are, son.

40:49.456 --> 40:53.084
I can return you to Paradise
if you wish.

40:53.168 --> 40:54.836
What have you done with our men?

40:55.504 --> 40:58.715
It is their choice to stay or leave.

40:58.799 --> 41:01.217
Some prefer to stay.

41:01.302 --> 41:04.430
So, tell me, Marco Polo...

41:04.513 --> 41:06.307
why did you come?

41:06.973 --> 41:09.851
To discover or to destroy?

41:09.935 --> 41:12.396
Give me my men
and I will give you the answer.

41:15.148 --> 41:17.651
Discovery.

41:17.734 --> 41:20.487
I came to learn
who hired your assassins.

41:21.988 --> 41:23.615
Offer me this knowledge...

41:23.699 --> 41:27.536
and you will gain favor
with the most powerful man on earth.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.705
The Great Khan lives, then.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.123
And your disciples do not.

41:34.418 --> 41:36.169
Kill us...

41:37.296 --> 41:41.091
and the Khan will finish
what his ancestors began.

41:41.174 --> 41:43.844
He must find us first.

41:43.927 --> 41:45.721
(Marco)
If I could find you...

41:46.472 --> 41:49.391
the Mongols will find you.

41:49.475 --> 41:53.312
They will rain fire,
black out the sun.

41:53.395 --> 41:56.523
You will have no peace,
no sanctuary...

41:56.607 --> 41:59.985
and my Great Khan
will prove you mortal.

42:00.068 --> 42:05.574
You are precisely
the kind of young man I welcome here.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.370
Clever... spirited...

42:09.453 --> 42:15.000
and deserving of Paradise,
however you define it.

42:22.298 --> 42:27.053
We do not deal in name and faces...

42:28.597 --> 42:31.307
only in coin and anonymity.

42:31.392 --> 42:34.395
And how much coin
did the Song Chancellor give you?

42:35.145 --> 42:40.901
The hand that dropped the purse
lives far closer to home, son.

42:52.413 --> 42:55.081
(Old Man)
Safe journey, Marco Polo.

42:56.332 --> 42:58.126
(Man groaning weakly)

43:13.349 --> 43:16.395
How many more days and nights
will this continue?

43:16.478 --> 43:17.521
(Yusuf sighs)

43:17.604 --> 43:21.733
What do you hope to get from a man...
we know can give you nothing?

43:23.402 --> 43:25.821
Nothing but hope...

43:25.904 --> 43:29.450
that he might give me
anything to use to avoid your war.

43:32.411 --> 43:36.498
You and I are not Mongols.
We are servants.

43:36.582 --> 43:38.083
(Chuckles)
This is not my war.

43:38.166 --> 43:41.002
Yet you fight for it so rabidly.

43:41.086 --> 43:43.338
And you so rabidly against it.

43:43.422 --> 43:44.506
Why?

43:45.424 --> 43:48.844
The rebels have not once
set foot outside Xiangyang...

43:48.927 --> 43:51.179
for any purpose
but trade and travel.

43:51.262 --> 43:52.556
They stage raids

43:52.639 --> 43:54.808
and they attack my collectors
as they ride the realm.

43:54.891 --> 43:59.438
The price of doing business
in a treacherous world.

43:59.521 --> 44:03.775
Their army hides behind walls
for fear of extermination,

44:03.859 --> 44:07.696
a wall that has
defied and denied us for 70 years.

44:07.779 --> 44:10.866
Our men will die for no reason...

44:10.949 --> 44:14.285
save the ego of the man
ordering the breach.

44:15.662 --> 44:17.581
Ego...

44:17.664 --> 44:20.291
not armies, destroys empires.

44:21.752 --> 44:26.089
Our Khan is chased to the wall
by the ghost of Genghis.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.887
Our Khan still breathes.

44:33.304 --> 44:34.806
(Man groaning)

44:37.893 --> 44:40.979
(Yusuf) The man will soon
join his brothers...

44:41.062 --> 44:44.315
and if you have your way, Ahmad...

44:44.399 --> 44:46.485
so shall we all.

44:52.490 --> 44:53.700
(Sighs)

45:07.213 --> 45:10.091
(Jia Sidao)
Word from my sister.

45:10.175 --> 45:13.554
Someone has attempted
to kill the barbarian king.

45:20.351 --> 45:22.979
We're not alone
in our loathing of the Khan.

45:28.026 --> 45:31.529
The devil sleeps soundly tonight.

45:31.613 --> 45:33.114
It displeases me.

45:34.032 --> 45:37.619
But he will survive.
He's fated to do so.

45:45.376 --> 45:49.130
Someone has foolishly
stepped upon my path...

45:49.214 --> 45:52.634
endeavoring to forge a tributary
and force me down it.

45:53.551 --> 45:55.887
The Khan will awaken.

45:55.971 --> 45:58.890
The Mongol horde
will descend upon my wall...

45:58.974 --> 46:00.892
and my blade...

46:00.976 --> 46:04.395
will find its destiny
in the barbarian's heart.

46:09.860 --> 46:12.821
You are the only one
I might speak freely to...

46:12.904 --> 46:15.198
the only one I can trust.

46:19.661 --> 46:22.748
It makes me happy
to know I have this with you.

46:26.793 --> 46:29.004
(Byamba)
This is my father's private quarters.

46:29.087 --> 46:32.215
The traitor
is someone in his service...

46:32.298 --> 46:33.591
someone he trusts.

46:34.509 --> 46:36.637
I may know the hand
that made these marks.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.013
Whose hand?

46:38.764 --> 46:40.974
Someone who has passed on.

46:56.698 --> 46:58.616
Two months to the Hindu Kush.

46:58.700 --> 47:02.120
Up, down, give or take a year
and you're in Venice.

47:02.203 --> 47:05.373
You have time
before the snows fall.

47:05.456 --> 47:07.918
You were killed by the Hashshashin.

47:09.836 --> 47:11.129
You would let me go?

47:11.212 --> 47:13.173
You are a guest
in someone else's home.

47:13.256 --> 47:15.008
You should leave when you wish.

47:15.091 --> 47:18.469
Upon our return, your host may be gone
and you would be friendless.

47:18.553 --> 47:20.681
Are we not now friends, Byamba?

47:20.764 --> 47:23.058
I cannot save you in Cambulac.

47:30.648 --> 47:32.400
Would you defy the Khan?

47:32.483 --> 47:33.651
(Byamba)
No...

47:33.735 --> 47:36.071
but this is my home...

47:36.154 --> 47:39.407
and if someone were keeping me from it,
I would kill to return.

47:42.618 --> 47:43.995
(Sighing)

48:27.205 --> 48:28.623
(Ahmad)
Jingim!

48:28.706 --> 48:30.291
Our father wakes.

48:32.794 --> 48:34.629
Welcome news, brother.

48:35.797 --> 48:37.382
I will join him.

49:12.375 --> 49:14.585
My head is weak.

49:15.837 --> 49:17.547
It will strengthen.

49:18.840 --> 49:21.759
Perhaps it's best if it did not.

49:21.843 --> 49:25.055
My son seems to have
that side well under control.

49:26.472 --> 49:29.767
You could easily have rushed into war.

49:29.851 --> 49:32.687
Few would have questioned the move.

49:32.770 --> 49:34.772
Your control guided you.

49:36.274 --> 49:38.776
I never felt in control, Sire.

49:38.860 --> 49:40.278
(Chuckling)

49:45.992 --> 49:47.828
Curse of the Khanate.

49:49.204 --> 49:51.414
The kingdom must know
that I'm alive and well

49:51.497 --> 49:53.624
before we march into war.

49:53.708 --> 49:55.919
Get me to my throne.

49:57.628 --> 49:58.671
(Grunting)

49:59.881 --> 50:00.966
(Chuckles)

50:36.292 --> 50:38.294
(Horses approaching)

50:58.731 --> 51:00.901
(Byamba) It has details
of your inner chamber

51:00.984 --> 51:03.153
few would know, Lord Khan.

51:03.236 --> 51:06.697
I spend my Khanate
embracing enemy cultures.

51:06.781 --> 51:11.202
Treachery grows well in
the fertile soil of contempt I've tilled.

51:11.286 --> 51:12.703
Who else knows of this map?

51:12.787 --> 51:16.499
No one... but Byamba,
myself, and its creator.

51:16.582 --> 51:18.209
Circle must remain small.

51:18.293 --> 51:19.544
What of Jingim?

51:20.503 --> 51:23.423
I do not wish to burden him as of yet.

51:23.506 --> 51:25.300
You say you recognize the scratch?

51:26.217 --> 51:29.887
I wish to confirm this belief
before I tarnish his name any further.

51:32.390 --> 51:34.725
I trust you both to do so.

51:34.809 --> 51:38.146
Follow the map, where it leads,
under my aegis.

51:38.229 --> 51:40.231
Bring answers back to your Khan.

51:51.159 --> 51:53.036
Hold, Latin.

52:00.418 --> 52:04.880
You defended me courageously...
even in the face of death.

52:05.798 --> 52:07.550
I was one of many...

52:07.633 --> 52:10.345
and it pleases me greatly
to return and find you well.

52:10.428 --> 52:12.138
Mmm.

52:12.222 --> 52:14.349
Have you made your decision...

52:14.432 --> 52:16.684
regarding the fate
of your father and uncle?

52:17.602 --> 52:20.271
No, Lord Kublai.

52:20.355 --> 52:22.940
I thought... I hoped...

52:24.150 --> 52:25.860
you might pardon them.

52:26.569 --> 52:28.363
Is pardon punishment?

52:29.780 --> 52:33.743
I wished... you would spare them.

52:34.577 --> 52:36.412
Why would I do that?

52:40.208 --> 52:41.501
(Maffeo praying in Latin)

53:07.360 --> 53:08.694
(Screaming)

53:11.406 --> 53:13.074
(Whimpering)

53:22.042 --> 53:23.584
(Screaming)

53:31.092 --> 53:32.593
(Niccolò groaning)
