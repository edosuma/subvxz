Never!

For 20 minutes, the sensors
energy...

02:09.137 --> 02:11.637
In prison on the H.I.D.R.A.
Went crazy.

02:11.638 --> 02:14.338

02:14.339 --> 02:16.639
All this concentrated around one man.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.040
Kang.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.041
Wait.
I do not understand...

02:23.042 --> 02:24.942
Without his armor or his ship...

02:24.943 --> 02:27.943
Kang could not do any tricks temporal, right?

02:27.944 --> 02:29.344
So what is happening?

02:49.352 --> 02:51.252
So let's...

03:18.553 --> 03:19.853
Hello, Kang.

03:20.854 --> 03:24.054
The Council of Kangs.
Came to rejoice?

03:24.355 --> 03:27.855
To mock
my arrest at the hands of these primitives?

03:27.856 --> 03:30.856
And this is not exactly what you would do
, Kang?

03:30.857 --> 03:33.357
All of us are you, anyway
.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.858
<i> Withdrawn from other timelines. </ I></i>

03:36.059 --> 03:38.759
Introduce the problem to the Council.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.260
Your timeline
became... dangerous.

03:43.261 --> 03:45.261
What are you talking about?

03:45.262 --> 03:47.062
These Avengers...

03:47.063 --> 03:50.263
We saw them appear in multiple timelines.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.364
Only for disposal.

03:53.065 --> 03:56.565
But in his,
their power is growing.

03:56.566 --> 03:59.166
Over time,
if not held...

03:59.167 --> 04:01.567
These so-called "heroes"...

04:01.568 --> 04:05.968
Could threaten all Kangs,
across the timeline.

04:05.969 --> 04:08.769
They are nothing to me!

04:08.770 --> 04:10.370
Of course not.

04:10.971 --> 04:13.671
You
seems to have things under control.

04:14.672 --> 04:17.272
The Council of Kangs
vowed never interfere...

04:17.273 --> 04:19.273
On a timeline of another Kang.

04:19.274 --> 04:22.274
But because of the danger of its
Avengers...

04:22.275 --> 04:24.775
We made an exception.

04:31.776 --> 04:34.176
Take care of the Avengers, Kang
...

04:34.177 --> 04:35.877
Just like we did.

04:35.878 --> 04:40.478
The world does not need these... heroes.

04:43.479 --> 04:45.079
... Finish it!

04:47.380 --> 04:49.380
Indeed, Thunder.

04:49.781 --> 04:51.381
Let's finish this.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.982
- Wow!
- What happened?!

04:56.983 --> 04:59.683
How did he do it?
He ​​was arrested and then...

04:59.684 --> 05:02.084
Our friends are in danger!
Is all that matters!

05:02.085 --> 05:04.085
Avante, Avengers!

05:21.386 --> 05:23.086
Wait. He fled
?

05:23.087 --> 05:24.987
Kang the Conqueror, fled
?

05:24.988 --> 05:26.388
Not likely, Vespa.

05:26.389 --> 05:27.989
Iron Man,
need to track it.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.990

05:29.991 --> 05:31.291
<i> Pardon me, sir... </ i></i>

<i> An attacker in the reactor chamber

05:35.594 --> 05:38.094
Kang may have gone to my office.

05:57.295 --> 05:59.795
Kang,
move away from my ARC reactor...

05:59.796 --> 06:02.196
- And surrender.
- You heard the man.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.797
Enough!

06:07.998 --> 06:10.498
Avengers,
Hit him with everything!

06:34.999 --> 06:38.499
<i> Notice.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000

06:41.001 --> 06:43.701

Someone holds that reactor!

06:54.802 --> 06:57.902

Get out , birds!

07:26.007 --> 07:28.507
Your buddy will make the neighborhood a bite.

07:30.108 --> 07:32.408
Peanut butter and jelly shelled.

07:32.409 --> 07:33.709
Thanks, Aunt...

07:34.210 --> 07:35.510
May?

07:36.211 --> 07:38.011
This does not look good at all.

07:56.712 --> 07:59.012
Today will be one of those days, huh?

08:02.513 --> 08:05.513
Here is the Bendis.
I need reinforcements in the 5th...

08:12.514 --> 08:16.114
<i> Watashi Iron Fist.
Tatakai takanai. </ I></i>

08:21.115 --> 08:24.115
- What did you say to them?
- Said he did not want to fight.

08:24.116 --> 08:26.116
Do you have serious problems,
guy!

08:26.117 --> 08:29.617
- Will you help me, Cage?
- You have everything under control.

08:29.618 --> 08:32.618
Also, Fist,
no contract, no money.

08:32.619 --> 08:35.119
We are heroes of rent.
No heroes without payment.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.620
Look around you.
The city went crazy.

08:37.621 --> 08:39.221
E has this weird energy.

08:39.222 --> 08:41.522
And I think I saw some cowboys fighting...

08:41.523 --> 08:43.523
With medieval knights
a few blocks away.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.824
We need to do something.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.625
If the problem is so huge...

08:46.626 --> 08:48.926
Then must have someone willing to pay cash.

08:52.627 --> 08:54.627
Okay.
We help.

08:54.628 --> 08:57.628
But it all smacks me
the issue of the Avengers.

08:57.629 --> 08:59.429
Then we send
to account for them.

08:59.430 --> 09:00.730
Is fair.

09:00.731 --> 09:03.031
Since you mentioned it,
where are the Avengers?

09:34.032 --> 09:35.032
5 SECONDS TO REBOOT

09:35.033 --> 09:36.033
SECONDS TO REBOOT  4

09:36.034 --> 09:37.034
3 SECONDS TO REBOOT

09:37.035 --> 09:38.035
2 SECONDS TO REBOOT

09:38.036 --> 09:39.636
Come on! Come on!

09:57.237 --> 09:59.237
Thing, what was that?

09:59.238 --> 10:00.838
What is going on here?

10:00.839 --> 10:03.839
Better not ask,
I think.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.740
For this gala clothing,
Stark?

10:05.741 --> 10:07.241
Tired of old?

10:10.242 --> 10:13.042
Okay.
I think I must be in a parallel universe.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.343
Who are you?

10:14.344 --> 10:17.344
I am the War Machine.
My name is James Rhodes.

10:17.345 --> 10:18.645
Working pro Tony.

10:18.646 --> 10:21.446
And where's the guy?
Where the Avengers?

10:26.847 --> 10:28.947
I do not know.
I can not contact with Tony.

10:28.948 --> 10:31.848
Where is your team?
The Fantastic Four?

10:31.849 --> 10:34.649
A diplomatic mission in another dimension.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.450
I stayed home to watch the game.

10:36.451 --> 10:38.951
The game I'm missing
through it all here!

10:42.752 --> 10:45.452
You can see what the score is
that computer there?

11:07.079 --> 11:09.562
Okay, think,
you can solve this.

11:09.563 --> 11:12.213
Dinosaurs are extinct, so
that are not dinosaurs.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.482
Maybe ghosts dinosaurs,
that's stupid.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.041
Maybe they are time travelers...

11:23.715 --> 11:26.067
Stopped, boy!
Sit! Sit!

11:28.223 --> 11:29.593
Hey, ugly!

11:31.093 --> 11:34.547
Whether  bite someone?
Try me.

11:48.622 --> 11:50.371
Was that really necessary?

11:50.372 --> 11:52.228
You wiped out the dinosaurs.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.864
- Again.
- You're welcome.

11:55.411 --> 11:57.677
Any idea what's going on here?

11:58.225 --> 11:59.669
Where the Avengers?

11:59.670 --> 12:01.307

12:35.277 --> 12:37.988
I'm sure he talked to you, namesake.

12:37.989 --> 12:39.895
Okay,
and what should I do?

12:39.896 --> 12:41.775
No idea what's going on.

12:41.776 --> 12:43.162

12:43.506 --> 12:45.704

12:55.932 --> 12:57.676

12:58.116 --> 12:59.872
Well, I'm
Spider-Man and...

12:59.873 --> 13:01.721
This is my loyal partner,
Wolverine.

13:01.722 --> 13:03.556
Do not force  head web.

13:05.483 --> 13:08.739
Somebody knows why
has time to be breaking?

13:09.134 --> 13:11.270
Struggling with cavemen
the way here.

13:11.271 --> 13:13.584
The computer affected English in my head...

13:13.585 --> 13:15.935
Is saying that such a...
Kang the Conqueror...

13:15.936 --> 13:18.513
Is riding a citadel Century 40 here.

13:18.514 --> 13:21.391
And that's leaving time
and we should stop it.

13:21.754 --> 13:24.091
- Does this make sense to anyone?
- No.

13:24.092 --> 13:27.406
But if Stark has
six of us to save the world...

13:27.407 --> 13:29.565
Then we're in trouble.

13:30.581 --> 13:32.609
Okay, thanks for that.

13:32.989 --> 13:35.730
So...
Avante, Avengers?

13:37.218 --> 13:39.034
This could have been better.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.734
Progress temporal phase:

13:42.566 --> 13:45.047
<i> Transfer Citadel in 82%. </ I></i>

13:45.048 --> 13:47.477
Kang,
even if the future is...

13:47.478 --> 13:49.675
So how many times do I have to beat you?

13:49.973 --> 13:53.394
Move away from the machine now
before we oblige you.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.788
Interesting.

13:55.789 --> 13:58.568
They think they are the New Avengers?

13:58.873 --> 14:03.208
Let me say what history
speaks of his team.

14:03.851 --> 14:05.381
Nothing!

14:05.382 --> 14:08.094
Enough talk!
Let's do this!

14:08.095 --> 14:10.608
- Do not wait, we have...
- What? Are you kidding?

14:10.609 --> 14:13.334
Is a lonely guy,
what will he do?

14:38.042 --> 14:40.657
Sorry, Thing.
Kang, where is he?

14:57.012 --> 14:59.012
Sorry, my fault.

15:15.001 --> 15:19.947
I... do it... to pieces!

15:39.567 --> 15:40.898
What was that?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.860
He ​​treated us like we were nothing.

15:43.322 --> 15:46.007
Spider-Man and Wolverine are still there.

15:46.757 --> 15:48.322
Coming!

15:52.162 --> 15:53.471
Me wide!

15:53.472 --> 15:54.997
get the guy, and you...

15:54.998 --> 15:58.261
Ia same? Wow, yeah,
must be a mutant thing...

15:58.262 --> 16:01.148
But not win a fight
carrying a laser in the face!

16:01.149 --> 16:03.966
Guys, guys!
Look!

16:08.580 --> 16:09.952
What's going on?

16:09.953 --> 16:12.539
Is being replaced.

16:12.540 --> 16:15.064
Kang is bringing his future here.

16:15.446 --> 16:18.947
He has guns, robots, and spaceships
're bringing everything down here.

16:20.090 --> 16:22.010
He will dominate the world.

16:27.752 --> 16:29.657
This is at least possible?

16:30.269 --> 16:32.245
The Q.F. 've seen worse.

16:32.246 --> 16:35.679
So how can we stop it? Defeating Kang
?

16:35.680 --> 16:39.735
Look at it in
defeated without even sweating.

16:39.978 --> 16:41.287
This is with us.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.022
Kang is not invincible.

16:43.023 --> 16:46.130
The Avengers
already defeated and want to know how?

16:46.131 --> 16:48.929
as a team.
There tripping each other.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.978
They worked together and defeated him.

16:50.979 --> 16:52.436
And that's what we'll do.

16:52.437 --> 16:54.336
Now we have to turn off the machine Kang.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.651
I have an idea,
I just need time.

16:58.036 --> 17:00.797
And I need you to take the
Kang from there.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.640
I can do it.

17:06.229 --> 17:09.054
<i> Transfer the Citadel in 93%. </ I></i>

17:17.864 --> 17:20.871
Enough!
Avengers want to be?

17:20.872 --> 17:23.178
Then share their fate!

17:24.560 --> 17:27.020
Pedregoso, as his throwing arm is
?

17:27.021 --> 17:28.968
Can you throw a fastball?

17:28.969 --> 17:30.573
Course.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.907
It's time Dick!

17:42.979 --> 17:45.652
<i> Transfer the Citadel in 96%. </ I></i>

17:45.653 --> 17:47.510
JARVIS, buddy, there is
?

17:47.511 --> 17:48.853
<i> Indeed, Spiderman. </ I></i>

17:48.854 --> 17:50.966
<i>
I am transmitting on the same frequency... </ i></i>

17:50.967 --> 17:53.181
<i> that lets you capture your
spider crawlers. </ I></i>

17:53.182 --> 17:55.986
What? The Ferrinho know about...
Do you know? That can wait!

17:55.987 --> 17:58.614
- Know how to disconnect it?
- No.

17:58.615 --> 18:01.297
What kind of supercomputer butler are you?

18:01.298 --> 18:03.624
<i> Technology is
Kang Century 40. </ I></i>

18:03.625 --> 18:05.913
<i>
operates in a way that does not understand. </ I></i>

18:05.914 --> 18:08.727
<i> seems to be controlled by Kang via
thought. </ i></i>

18:08.728 --> 18:10.556
<i> Or possibly some intuition... </ i></i>

18:10.557 --> 18:12.463
<i>
Iron Man did not notice. </ i></i>

18:13.066 --> 18:16.651
Okay , and if I start to dismantle it all
?

18:17.353 --> 18:19.412
No, no, wait, it seems
energy cells.

18:19.413 --> 18:22.562
- And if you disconnect them?
- I could turn it off.

18:23.049 --> 18:25.099
<i> Or, most likely,
it could explode. </ I></i>

18:25.100 --> 18:27.090
You're pretty boring,
know that?

18:43.271 --> 18:46.010
Okay, tell me all, I have to...

18:46.300 --> 18:48.535
Intuition! My spider sense
!

18:48.536 --> 18:50.425
If you do something that will lead to explosion...

18:50.426 --> 18:51.986
My spider sense will tell me.

18:52.918 --> 18:54.823
Yeah, Spider, no problem.

18:54.824 --> 18:56.175
You can do this.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.940
You can do...

18:58.146 --> 18:59.607
Okay, this is not.

19:08.409 --> 19:10.630
<i> Alert, initiated shutdown. </ I></i>

19:13.614 --> 19:15.265
<i> temporal changes detected. </ I></i>

19:15.266 --> 19:16.598
<i> You want to interfere? </ I></i>

19:16.599 --> 19:18.550
I prefer the term
"meddle".

19:23.965 --> 19:26.612
Your future ends here.

19:41.069 --> 19:43.203
No, no!

19:44.445 --> 19:46.732
Three chances to guess where he went.

19:57.024 --> 19:58.408
Kang!

20:01.531 --> 20:03.511
No!

20:11.805 --> 20:13.942
So, we won?

20:16.965 --> 20:19.739
New Avengers,
it really worked.

20:21.585 --> 20:24.507
Well, Kang went,
who knows where.

20:24.508 --> 20:27.166
As Or.
You're all alive.

20:27.725 --> 20:29.113
We saved the world.

20:29.114 --> 20:31.694
But I think Luke Cage
vai mandar an account for you.

20:31.695 --> 20:33.769
Yes, I've received.

20:33.770 --> 20:36.954
So that's basically it.

20:36.955 --> 20:39.711
I think I can go back to hunting and thieves...

20:40.163 --> 20:42.613
Spider-Man, you did well.
All were well.

20:42.955 --> 20:44.471
The world needs heroes.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.921
All agreed that even as a member only reservation...

20:48.123 --> 20:49.605
We want as an Avenger.

20:51.028 --> 20:53.517
Wow!
I do not know what to say!

20:54.346 --> 20:55.687
Thank you.

20:57.041 --> 21:00.434
So this gives me
off somewhere?

21:01.248 --> 21:03.651
We are sure about that?

21:04.305 --> 21:10.575
