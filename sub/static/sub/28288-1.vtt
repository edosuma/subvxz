00:01.804 --> 00:05.068
Nearly 200 years ago,
9 knights founded our order.

00:05.111 --> 00:06.939
We are the Knights Templar.

00:06.983 --> 00:08.724
We protect the innocent.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.247
We are men of honor.

00:10.290 --> 00:12.945
We fight for the Holy Land.

00:12.989 --> 00:16.079
We fight for the glory of God!

00:17.559 --> 00:20.126
I have a responsibility
to all the brothers.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.321
If you cannot
hold your own...

00:21.345 --> 00:23.608
I hurt my leg
protecting you!

00:23.652 --> 00:25.455
Landry du Lauzon
is sleeping with your wife.

00:25.479 --> 00:26.698
Brother Gawain...

00:26.742 --> 00:28.265
He had relations
with a married woman

00:28.308 --> 00:30.223
who now
carries his child.

00:30.267 --> 00:34.140
The King of France has sent
mercenaries to kill us.

00:34.184 --> 00:37.491
Let these men be in no doubt

00:37.535 --> 00:40.930
that they have chosen
a mighty opponent!

00:40.973 --> 00:45.151
You taught me
use my pain against my enemy.

00:48.154 --> 00:50.722
If you ever loved me,
spare his life.

00:50.766 --> 00:54.117
You want to use my love
to save your love?

00:54.160 --> 00:55.335
Very well.

00:55.379 --> 00:57.163
I'll spare his life...

00:57.207 --> 00:59.862
- No!
- ...and take yours, instead.

00:59.905 --> 01:01.515
The child,
I felt it move.

01:03.169 --> 01:05.345
It's a girl!

Aah!

01:35.767 --> 01:38.465
Philip!

01:38.509 --> 01:39.815
Landry!

02:04.753 --> 02:06.711
You killed Joan!

02:10.019 --> 02:12.499
No, Landry.
You killed her.

02:15.154 --> 02:16.590
You betrayed me.

02:20.029 --> 02:21.378
You betrayed us all.

02:30.822 --> 02:33.390
I'm no longer the novice
I once was.

02:52.452 --> 02:55.107
God has forsaken you.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.661
Shh.

03:29.185 --> 03:32.928
♪ Salve, Regina ♪

03:32.971 --> 03:36.192
♪ Mater misericordiae ♪

03:36.235 --> 03:38.672
♪ Et spes nostra ♪

03:38.716 --> 03:40.326
♪ Salve ♪

03:52.861 --> 03:55.341
Is this truly what you want?

03:55.385 --> 03:57.648
I am an enemy
of King Philip.

03:57.691 --> 03:59.345
She will not be safe
if she stays with me.

03:59.389 --> 04:00.956
But she's
your flesh and blood.

04:00.999 --> 04:03.195
What would you have me do?
Submit her to a life of peril?

04:03.219 --> 04:04.960
I would see her
grow up with her father.

04:05.003 --> 04:06.439
A blessing
you failed to receive.

04:06.483 --> 04:09.660
Tancrede.

04:09.703 --> 04:13.055
Honor my request.

04:13.098 --> 04:15.840
She will grow up in a home
far away from here.

04:15.884 --> 04:17.536
And no one will know
of her location.

04:22.499 --> 04:23.717
What will you do now?

04:23.761 --> 04:25.545
I will go to the Temple
in Chartres,

04:25.589 --> 04:28.026
make amends
with our Templar brothers.

04:28.070 --> 04:30.028
- Do you think that's wise?
- Your meaning?

04:30.072 --> 04:31.682
Many of our brothers
died at Versailles.

04:31.725 --> 04:33.510
Many at Chartres
hold you accountable.

04:33.553 --> 04:35.531
That's all the more reason
I must seek their forgiveness.

04:35.555 --> 04:38.080
Landry, you misunderstand me.
They will not welcome you back.

04:38.123 --> 04:39.908
Of course they will.
I'm a Temple Master.

04:39.951 --> 04:41.561
Of a Temple
that no longer exists.

04:41.605 --> 04:43.172
What am I
if not a Templar?

04:43.215 --> 04:45.174
You're a father.

04:45.217 --> 04:47.132
You're a father.

04:47.176 --> 04:49.613
I am unworthy of her.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.658
I have to
go to Chartres.

04:51.702 --> 04:53.502
I have to make things right
with our brothers.

04:53.530 --> 04:56.011
I have to make things right
with God.

04:56.054 --> 04:58.013
Only then can I make things
right with her.

05:00.537 --> 05:01.843
Then you must go.

05:05.368 --> 05:07.196
Forgive me.

05:07.239 --> 05:09.328
God bless you.

05:09.372 --> 05:11.853
God keep you.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.419
God protect you.

05:20.122 --> 05:21.514
I'll never forget this.

05:21.558 --> 05:24.387
Your daughter...
she will be baptized.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.215
With what name?

05:26.258 --> 05:28.913
Eve.

05:28.957 --> 05:31.742
She will be called Eve.

05:32.961 --> 05:34.614
Come on, Eve.

05:38.575 --> 05:40.055
Hup!

05:40.098 --> 05:41.839
Hup!

05:47.758 --> 05:48.933
Hyah!

06:07.038 --> 06:08.605
Who's there?

06:08.648 --> 06:11.303
Landry du Lauzon,
Master of the Temple at Paris.

06:11.347 --> 06:13.479
Open the gate.

06:13.523 --> 06:15.307
One moment, Master.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.403
You're not welcome here.

06:26.188 --> 06:28.407
- I'm a Temple Master.
- You're nothing.

06:28.451 --> 06:30.366
The Paris Temple fell
because of you.

06:30.409 --> 06:32.020
I will not
see the same happen here!

06:32.063 --> 06:33.543
You are expelled
from the Order.

06:33.586 --> 06:34.979
I'm expelled?

06:35.023 --> 06:36.502
Grandmaster?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.767
Grandmaster, please.

06:46.338 --> 06:48.384
Brothers, please.

07:01.527 --> 07:03.051
You betrayed
the brotherhood.

07:03.094 --> 07:05.705
All rights and claims as
a Templar have been revoked.

07:05.749 --> 07:08.665
And your sentence
is banishment.

07:36.084 --> 07:39.000
Open the gate!
Open it!

07:41.002 --> 07:44.353
We didn't let you in last week.
Or the week before that.

07:44.396 --> 07:47.182
The Grandmaster's made it clear
you're not a Templar anymore.

08:19.953 --> 08:21.694
It's all right.
It's all right.

08:21.738 --> 08:23.870
De Molay's
granted your request.

08:23.914 --> 08:27.483
He will consider your case
for readmittance.

08:27.526 --> 08:28.832
Brother.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.138
Brother.

08:31.574 --> 08:34.097
Aren't we going to
the council chamber?

08:34.142 --> 08:38.015
Only brothers are allowed
inside the Temple.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.756
Why are you
allowing this?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.889
Landry's the fool who left
the gold in the Paris Temple.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.587
He's unworthy
of our consideration.

08:44.630 --> 08:47.155
He is one of
our most capable fighters.

08:59.732 --> 09:02.387
For weeks, you have slept
outside the Temple walls

09:02.431 --> 09:04.520
with little
to eat or drink,

09:04.563 --> 09:07.218
begging to be allowed
back into the brotherhood.

09:07.262 --> 09:08.959
Why?

09:09.002 --> 09:11.614
Because you are my family
and my brothers.

09:11.657 --> 09:15.226
And without you...
I'm nothing.

09:15.270 --> 09:16.662
I have nothing.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.577
I know my mistakes.

09:18.621 --> 09:22.581
I have failed as a Templar
and as a man,

09:22.625 --> 09:26.803
but please, allow me
to atone for my sins

09:26.846 --> 09:30.981
in the eyes of God...
and all of you.

09:31.024 --> 09:34.115
Landry's been corrupted
by the Devil.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.117
He slept
with the king's wife

09:36.160 --> 09:38.293
and sired a child
with her.

09:38.336 --> 09:40.904
That alone is reason
for expulsion.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.167
And, brothers,
have none of you broken a vow?

09:43.211 --> 09:44.995
Not one rule
of our code?

09:45.038 --> 09:47.389
It appears Brother Tancrede
reveals more about himself

09:47.432 --> 09:49.739
than he defends Landry.

09:49.782 --> 09:52.785
Did not King Philip attack us
because of Landry?

09:52.829 --> 09:54.352
Have we forgotten
our duty

09:54.396 --> 09:57.790
to remove the wicked sheep
from the flock, brothers?!

09:57.834 --> 10:00.184
Oh, clearly, Brother Berenger
and Brother Angus

10:00.228 --> 10:01.814
have never made a mistake.

10:01.838 --> 10:03.666
He broke the vows,
Tancrede!

10:03.709 --> 10:05.624
He must pay
for his sins!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.975
Brothers, please.
Brothers.

10:09.019 --> 10:11.369
Have we forgotten
that he is the same man

10:11.413 --> 10:13.545
who fought with us at Acre?

10:13.589 --> 10:17.332
Have we forgotten how many lives
he saved in the Holy Land?

10:17.375 --> 10:19.160
I owe my life to him.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.466
And I know that many of you do,
too.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.033
Now, Landry has made
many mistakes,

10:23.076 --> 10:24.643
and he must atone for them.

10:24.687 --> 10:28.995
But I ask you who are we,
as men of Christ,

10:29.039 --> 10:32.390
if we do not give him
the chance of redemption?

10:32.434 --> 10:35.219
We are men of honor.

10:35.263 --> 10:36.481
And he is not!

10:36.525 --> 10:37.569
You talk of honor?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.096
Silence!

10:43.140 --> 10:44.794
I would not see
our proceedings

10:44.837 --> 10:47.579
devolve
into mindless quarrel.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.625
How do you respond?

10:55.370 --> 10:59.112
I have brought great shame
upon our house.

10:59.156 --> 11:01.419
And I will take any steps
that you will ask of me

11:01.463 --> 11:04.683
to right those wrongs.

11:04.727 --> 11:09.993
Brother Landry speaks
with a penitent heart.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.648
Yet I remain
fixed in my doubt.

11:12.691 --> 11:16.956
I have listened carefully
to your words,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.089
but the true measure
of a man

11:19.132 --> 11:21.352
are his deeds,
not his words.

11:21.396 --> 11:24.050
This man is unworthy
of returning as a Templar.

11:24.094 --> 11:29.839
In fact, I wouldn't even
consider him as an Initiate.

11:29.882 --> 11:32.929
Brother Talus once again
shares his wisdom with us.

11:32.972 --> 11:35.105
Thank you.

11:35.148 --> 11:40.284
We will not vote for
Landry's re-entry as a Templar.

11:40.328 --> 11:43.156
We will vote for his re-entry
as an Initiate.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.506
Grandmaster.

11:44.549 --> 11:46.377
I have made my decision.

11:46.421 --> 11:51.556
Reflect on that before
we reconvene to cast our vote.

12:06.354 --> 12:08.921
De Nogaret,
I hear Landry evades capture?

12:08.965 --> 12:10.967
He does, Your Majesty,

12:11.010 --> 12:13.162
but I have dispatched informants
throughout the kingdom,

12:13.186 --> 12:16.015
and I am confident they will be
able to uncover his location.

12:16.059 --> 12:19.018
The Paris Temple
is mine,

12:19.062 --> 12:21.325
but it is worth nothing to me,
De Nogaret,

12:21.369 --> 12:24.546
unless I seize their Temples at
Arville and Chartres, as well.

12:24.589 --> 12:27.070
That is where
their wealth lies.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.594
Gerard, how long until my army
is ready to attack?

12:29.638 --> 12:31.204
Not long, My Lord.

12:31.248 --> 12:34.120
Do it, Father. They must pay
for their offenses.

12:34.164 --> 12:36.906
If I may,
Your Majesty...

12:36.949 --> 12:39.561
As your Royal Adviser,
I must caution prudence.

12:39.604 --> 12:41.171
Why?

12:41.214 --> 12:43.608
The Templars maintain
Pope Boniface's support.

12:43.652 --> 12:47.133
To attack them would be
to make enemies with Rome,

12:47.177 --> 12:49.068
an act that could threaten
to divide your kingdom

12:49.092 --> 12:51.616
between those that follow
the Vicar of Christ and you.

12:51.660 --> 12:56.621
And possibly incite such action
as a call loan on your debts.

12:58.710 --> 13:01.496
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

13:01.539 --> 13:04.281
Patience
is the only path.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.937
They attacked me,
De Nogaret.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.765
They took up arms
against my army.

13:09.808 --> 13:12.115
And they will
be dealt with.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.247
Please,
grant me a little time.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.250
I believe I can find a way that
fulfills both of your wishes.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.562
Bring him in.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.659
This knight has been
spreading lies about you.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.188
Pascale believes
you killed Queen Joan.

13:46.758 --> 13:49.761
Is this true?

13:49.805 --> 13:51.720
Clearly
you're mistaken

13:51.763 --> 13:53.504
or you would have seen
Landry du Lauzon

13:53.548 --> 13:56.246
drive a sword into
my pregnant wife's belly.

14:00.642 --> 14:03.035
Do you know
what you just did?

14:03.079 --> 14:06.778
You made me relive
the worst day of my life.

14:09.346 --> 14:11.696
Joan was my true love.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.481
She was the mother
of my children

14:13.524 --> 14:17.049
and was carrying
my unborn son.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.533
You must think I'm weak

14:22.577 --> 14:26.145
to spread false rumors
in my house.

14:26.189 --> 14:29.148
In front of
my daughter.

14:29.192 --> 14:32.108
I know what I saw.

14:32.151 --> 14:35.764
Isabella, I think it best
if you leave us.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.897
It's about to become
quite uncomfortable.

14:38.941 --> 14:43.336
I would rather stay and witness
your justice, Father.

14:46.470 --> 14:50.692
I once regarded you as
one of my most trusted knights.

14:50.735 --> 14:54.304
However, the vaunted tales
of your heroism

14:54.347 --> 14:56.437
will slowly fade
from memory...

14:56.480 --> 14:59.483
along with the sound
of your own voice.

14:59.527 --> 15:02.486
No!

15:12.365 --> 15:14.193
See him to the dungeon.

15:34.649 --> 15:37.173
I, for Landry.

15:37.216 --> 15:39.088
Brother Berenger.

15:39.131 --> 15:41.133
I, opposed.

15:41.177 --> 15:43.614
Brother Talus.

15:43.658 --> 15:46.574
I, opposed.

15:46.617 --> 15:48.706
What is the tally,
Brother Angus?

15:48.750 --> 15:52.928
It stands equal with one brother
left to vote... Brother Naimon.

15:52.971 --> 15:56.497
Brother Naimon, you alone
must decide Landry's fate.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.369
May God guide you down
the proper path.

15:59.412 --> 16:03.068
Landry has dishonored
our Order

16:03.112 --> 16:06.028
by bringing shame
to us all.

16:06.071 --> 16:08.900
However,
as Christ has told us,

16:08.944 --> 16:10.728
"He that is without sin
among you,

16:10.772 --> 16:13.252
let him cast a stone
at her."

16:13.296 --> 16:17.561
As none of us are without sin,
I must heed Christ's teaching.

16:17.605 --> 16:20.390
I, for Landry.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.439
Brother Naimon has voted.

16:26.483 --> 16:28.485
As God is our witness,

16:28.529 --> 16:32.533
Landry is welcomed back into
our sacred Order as an Initiate

16:32.576 --> 16:35.666
and will commence training
presently.

16:45.502 --> 16:47.156
Just as Christ
rose from the dead,

16:47.199 --> 16:49.593
so, too,
you must be reborn.

16:49.637 --> 16:51.595
See to
his hair and beard.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.281
God be with you,
brother.

17:25.324 --> 17:26.587
I'm no longer
your brother.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.240
I'm an Initiate now.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.181
Rhone!

17:56.225 --> 17:58.357
God demands you focus
on the task at hand,

17:58.401 --> 17:59.900
not the fallen man
who joins your ranks.

17:59.924 --> 18:01.230
Yes, Initiate Master.

18:01.273 --> 18:02.840
Landry, grab a sack

18:02.884 --> 18:04.886
and get in line with
the rest of the Initiates.

18:04.929 --> 18:06.365
Yes, Initiate Master.

18:06.409 --> 18:08.541
These sacks
carry the same weight

18:08.585 --> 18:10.718
as the armor you will wear
in battle.

18:10.761 --> 18:13.285
Your physical foundation
must be built

18:13.329 --> 18:17.333
so you can protect your fellow
Christians from God's enemies.

18:17.376 --> 18:19.683
You've relinquished your titles
and ranks

18:19.727 --> 18:22.599
and willingly surrendered
your wealth and goods

18:22.643 --> 18:26.690
to join the Templar Order
and become servants of God.

18:26.734 --> 18:28.300
Why?!

18:28.344 --> 18:30.389
The love of God
and devotion to Him

18:30.433 --> 18:31.956
is all man needs
to survive

18:32.000 --> 18:34.089
in this vile and wretched world,
Initiate Master.

18:34.132 --> 18:38.093
Love of God
and devotion to Him!

18:38.136 --> 18:40.704
Two sacred pillars
of our Order.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.839
Raynald, get up.

18:44.882 --> 18:46.710
Get up. Hey.

18:50.322 --> 18:53.586
Each man must earn his own way
into the Temple.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.676
Ponder this
before the cross.

18:55.719 --> 18:59.070
Or defy me,
and be gone forever.

19:35.498 --> 19:38.066
Open the gates!

20:14.363 --> 20:15.363
Louis!

20:21.936 --> 20:24.547
The old lords
send their regards...

20:24.590 --> 20:25.983
while
the newly appointed lords

20:26.027 --> 20:28.681
have sworn their fealty to you,
Father.

20:28.725 --> 20:31.423
There remains
but a few disloyal barons

20:31.467 --> 20:33.382
before the entire kingdom's
under your rule.

20:33.425 --> 20:34.687
You honor me.

20:34.731 --> 20:37.255
I do as instructed.

20:40.128 --> 20:41.694
- Isabella.
- Brother!

20:45.873 --> 20:49.267
Oh, you must tell me
of your adventures.

20:50.878 --> 20:52.198
I wish I could have
gone with you.

20:52.227 --> 20:53.750
The south is no place
for a woman.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.187
Nor is being kept
within these walls.

20:56.231 --> 20:57.667
De Nogaret.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.843
You haven't taken
to slithering yet.

20:59.887 --> 21:01.410
Your father forbids it,
I'm afraid.

21:01.453 --> 21:03.891
Good to see you, old friend.

21:03.934 --> 21:06.589
Oh, De Nogaret, I'd have you
do something for me.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.112
Anything, my Prince.

21:08.156 --> 21:11.812
See that my horse is bathed,
brushed, and reshod.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.255
It's been a long journey, and
I'd see my steed taken care of.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.382
It would be my pleasure,
Prince Louis.

21:17.426 --> 21:18.707
After I've completed
the royal affairs...

21:18.731 --> 21:21.038
Now, De Nogaret.

21:21.082 --> 21:22.300
I'd have it done now.

21:22.344 --> 21:24.520
My Prince.

21:31.048 --> 21:32.920
We must celebrate
Prince Louis' return.

21:32.963 --> 21:36.097
Now you honor me, Father.

21:36.140 --> 21:40.188
Where is she?
Where's Mother?

21:46.498 --> 21:49.588
Tell me Landry's head
is on a pike somewhere.

21:49.632 --> 21:51.242
Tell me
you've retaliated!

21:54.332 --> 21:57.031
Mother's buried in Versailles,
and you've done nothing?!

21:58.597 --> 22:00.643
Father, why have you
not responded?

22:00.686 --> 22:01.707
De Nogaret
cautions patience.

22:01.731 --> 22:03.080
And you listen
to the fool?!

22:03.124 --> 22:05.691
I listen to his counsel.

22:05.735 --> 22:08.259
The Templars are under the
protection of Pope Boniface.

22:08.303 --> 22:10.958
Should I strike against them,
the pope could excommunicate me.

22:11.001 --> 22:13.699
He... He could excommunicate
all of us, all of France.

22:13.743 --> 22:16.311
He could even dispatch
a papal army into my streets.

22:16.354 --> 22:19.618
But she was your wife
and deserves retribution!

22:19.662 --> 22:22.926
She was a whore
who was unfaithful to me...

22:22.970 --> 22:25.973
the King of France!

22:26.016 --> 22:28.758
Your mother
has brought shame on us

22:28.801 --> 22:32.066
and dishonor to my name
and yours.

22:41.249 --> 22:46.297
My mother has trespassed
against you,

22:46.341 --> 22:48.778
and I am sorry for that.

22:50.954 --> 22:54.349
But she was
no common whore

22:54.392 --> 22:56.699
and will not
be regarded as such.

23:03.488 --> 23:06.100
Each one of you came to our
Temple of your own volition.

23:06.143 --> 23:08.189
- Did you not?
- Yes, Initiate Master.

23:08.232 --> 23:10.713
Each one of you came to
our Temple alone, did you not?

23:10.756 --> 23:12.106
Yes, Initiate Master.

23:12.149 --> 23:15.457
Yet when you are born,
you are not alone.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.112
You have a mother and a father
to protect you,

23:18.155 --> 23:20.331
to keep you safe.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.637
Why?

23:21.680 --> 23:24.074
Because
when a man stands alone,

23:24.118 --> 23:28.905
he is vulnerable to a physical
or spiritual attack.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.777
But when he stands
with his brothers,

23:31.821 --> 23:34.476
committed to his purpose,

23:34.519 --> 23:37.044
he is no longer alone.

23:37.087 --> 23:40.482
He is now part of
an impenetrable force.

23:40.525 --> 23:42.484
Fall into
teams of three.

23:53.016 --> 23:53.972
Charge us.

24:09.076 --> 24:11.165
Did I tell you
to stop?!

24:11.208 --> 24:12.993
No, Initiate Master.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.212
Each apple thrown
is the equivalent

24:15.256 --> 24:17.432
of the enemy breaking through
our first line in battle.

24:17.475 --> 24:20.609
Allow that to happen,
and you are dead.

24:20.652 --> 24:24.308
Landry, Rhone, Vasant.
Your turn.

24:24.352 --> 24:25.744
This is
trinity training.

24:25.788 --> 24:27.442
The Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.

24:27.485 --> 24:29.835
So, what do we do?

24:29.879 --> 24:31.228
We form a phalanx.

24:31.272 --> 24:33.535
Overlock our shields,
become one.

24:35.885 --> 24:37.626
Trust me.

24:43.327 --> 24:45.155
Get your head down.
Stay together.

24:45.199 --> 24:46.983
When a Templar
is closely ordered,

24:47.027 --> 24:49.594
an apple thrown in their midst
will not pass between them,

24:49.638 --> 24:52.032
but hit their shields
instead.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.511
Stay with me.
Don't panic.

24:59.517 --> 25:01.389
Ohh!

25:01.432 --> 25:02.912
You're dead.

25:02.955 --> 25:04.827
We had you.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.482
You had nothing.

25:07.525 --> 25:09.005
Line up!

25:11.225 --> 25:14.010
You recognized this
as trinity training,

25:14.054 --> 25:16.926
and you were correct
in forming a phalanx.

25:16.969 --> 25:20.886
But you failed to recognize
this wagon as higher ground...

25:20.930 --> 25:23.846
a sign your connection to God
has been compromised

25:23.889 --> 25:26.544
and proof you've been mentally
and spiritually separated

25:26.588 --> 25:28.329
from the righteous path
of the Templar.

25:28.372 --> 25:31.636
What do you mean, "mentally
and spiritually separated"?

25:31.680 --> 25:35.118
Landry will explain.

25:35.162 --> 25:37.077
Initiate Master?

25:37.120 --> 25:39.688
Recount rule 70
for Raynald.

25:50.351 --> 25:54.094
Rule 70 prohibits
the company of women.

25:55.921 --> 25:58.315
A rule
you failed to observe.

25:58.359 --> 25:59.838
Yes, Initiate Master.

25:59.882 --> 26:02.014
And were banished from the Order
as a result.

26:02.058 --> 26:04.495
Yes, Initiate Master.

26:04.539 --> 26:08.456
Landry stood alone,
apart from God and his brothers.

26:08.499 --> 26:10.849
Look at him and learn
from his mistakes.

26:10.893 --> 26:13.635
Initiate master, how can
a fallen brother like Landry

26:13.678 --> 26:15.463
be allowed back in
as an Initiate?

26:15.506 --> 26:20.120
Some brothers believe Landry
may yet be saved by God's grace.

26:20.163 --> 26:23.079
I am not one of them.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.778
But, Initiate Master,
you're still training him.

26:26.822 --> 26:29.477
That is not
without a purpose.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.957
Landry serves as an example
to us all...

26:32.001 --> 26:33.785
why the Templars
were founded.

26:33.829 --> 26:35.483
A Templar begins
as a simple man,

26:35.526 --> 26:37.180
just as many of
you Initiates do.

26:37.224 --> 26:39.356
But after your sacred training
is complete,

26:39.400 --> 26:42.925
you will be transformed into
Soldiers of Christ.

26:42.968 --> 26:47.190
Men ordained as
God's executioners.

27:00.421 --> 27:01.770
Yeah!

27:01.813 --> 27:04.903
Letholdus, victorious!

27:09.691 --> 27:13.303
And who shall follow up
such a display?

27:13.347 --> 27:18.134
There stand but two men able to
arouse such passion among you.

27:18.178 --> 27:22.617
The first has yet to leave
an opponent alive.

27:22.660 --> 27:25.794
The Bastard of Brittany.
Merek!

27:34.411 --> 27:40.112
But who... But who is man enough
to take on such a beast?

27:40.156 --> 27:42.550
There can be only one.

27:42.593 --> 27:45.509
A former soldier of God

27:45.553 --> 27:49.121
who bathes in the blood
of his opponents.

27:49.165 --> 27:53.300
I give you the Crusader!

28:39.998 --> 28:41.957
Get up, get up, get up!

29:26.958 --> 29:28.351
Move over.

29:28.395 --> 29:29.483
There isn't
enough room.

29:29.526 --> 29:31.963
There is.
Move over.

29:32.007 --> 29:33.661
I will not.

29:33.704 --> 29:35.402
Come on, Kelton.

29:35.445 --> 29:38.448
I have to share with Landry,
as is the rule.

29:38.492 --> 29:40.363
I don't give a shit.

29:40.407 --> 29:43.323
The sinner doesn't sit with us,
and neither do you.

29:43.366 --> 29:46.848
Hey. Come on.

29:46.891 --> 29:49.677
I've done nothing but be paired
in a task with you,

29:49.720 --> 29:51.853
and yet I'm regarded
as the same.

29:51.896 --> 29:53.898
Eat with Rhone.

29:53.942 --> 29:55.509
I'd rather starve
on the floor

29:55.552 --> 29:57.554
than be associated
with you again.

29:57.598 --> 29:58.860
Vasant.

30:17.748 --> 30:20.142
Hey. Eat. Go ahead.

30:20.185 --> 30:21.883
Come on.

30:27.236 --> 30:29.978
Why would you subject yourself
to this training

30:30.021 --> 30:32.023
and humiliation
if you're already a Templar?

30:33.808 --> 30:36.158
Because I must atone
for my sins.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.639
And in doing so,
humble myself before God.

30:41.163 --> 30:42.730
Humble?

30:46.473 --> 30:48.562
God has
turned His back on me

30:48.605 --> 30:51.869
for my offenses
against Him.

30:55.482 --> 30:58.223
Even the most devout,

30:58.267 --> 31:00.617
most pious among us
can become impure.

31:03.272 --> 31:05.622
While even the most vile
can be saved.

31:13.848 --> 31:16.459
Our capital still lies hidden
beneath the Paris Temple.

31:16.503 --> 31:18.243
King Philip has declared us
his enemy.

31:18.287 --> 31:19.636
Which is why
we must retrieve it.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.422
Grandmaster,
we must protect ourselves

31:22.465 --> 31:24.467
and those who have placed
their faith in us.

31:24.511 --> 31:26.251
There are
many men and women

31:26.295 --> 31:29.080
who desperately need our gold
to fund their journeys.

31:29.124 --> 31:30.647
And if our banks
are insolvent

31:30.691 --> 31:32.997
because our wealth
lies tied up in Paris,

31:33.041 --> 31:35.173
then we risk
tarnishing our reputation

31:35.217 --> 31:37.872
and potentially costing
innocent lives.

31:37.915 --> 31:40.309
We will always help
those in need.

31:40.352 --> 31:43.399
But our Paris Temple's been
occupied by the Royal Guard.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.140
The Royal Guard's
relaxed its watch.

31:45.183 --> 31:46.707
Grandmaster,
we need that.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.535
I'm well aware of what we need,
brother.

31:48.578 --> 31:51.668
But we can't ride into Paris
in strength

31:51.712 --> 31:54.192
and risk another conflict
with King Philip.

31:54.236 --> 31:57.718
And what makes you think
he hasn't taken that gold yet?

31:57.761 --> 32:00.460
Because it lies hidden
behind a vault.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.984
Its location known only to a few
brothers who lived there...

32:03.027 --> 32:05.334
Draper, Landry,
and myself.

32:05.377 --> 32:06.657
Now, if I could
take a few men...

32:06.683 --> 32:08.424
No,
it's too dangerous.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.514
There is a tunnel
hidden far beneath the Temple.

32:11.558 --> 32:15.039
Now, we can grab our gold and
leave without risking discovery.

32:15.083 --> 32:18.478
If this tunnel is as hidden
as Tancrede suggests,

32:18.521 --> 32:21.350
it could be worth our going in
and getting it.

32:21.393 --> 32:22.960
You agree with Tancrede?

32:23.004 --> 32:25.441
I agree that our capital
must be retrieved.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.183
But the task does not require
our brothers.

32:28.226 --> 32:29.967
The Initiates can go.

32:30.011 --> 32:32.100
You take men still suckling
at the breast?

32:32.143 --> 32:33.754
The Initiates
are perfectly capable

32:33.797 --> 32:35.320
of hauling gold
out of a tunnel.

32:35.364 --> 32:36.757
Gold we desperately need.

32:36.800 --> 32:41.022
Grandmaster...

32:41.065 --> 32:43.981
I would not
entrust our fortune

32:44.025 --> 32:46.897
to men who have yet to earn
their place among us.

32:46.941 --> 32:48.986
Please.
Let me take a few brothers.

32:49.030 --> 32:51.641
We can be in and out
without anyone seeing us.

32:51.685 --> 32:54.775
When has a mission ever gone
according to plan?

32:54.818 --> 32:57.081
Send the Initiates.
No one knows who they are.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.564
Both of you will go
with the Initiates.

33:01.608 --> 33:05.176
Get the gold
and get out quietly.

33:17.885 --> 33:21.062
Initiates, stand!

33:21.105 --> 33:26.241
Grandmaster De Molay
has requested your presence.

33:26.284 --> 33:28.460
You have prayed as monks.

33:28.504 --> 33:31.899
Now I will see you stand
as soldiers.

33:31.942 --> 33:35.293
The Templar treasury remains
within our Paris Temple.

33:35.337 --> 33:37.600
My Templar brothers
are going to retrieve it.

33:37.644 --> 33:39.863
You're going to accompany them.

33:47.436 --> 33:49.220
God has ordained this mission

33:49.264 --> 33:52.876
and will see that
no one is left behind.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.661
Draper! Move out!

33:54.704 --> 33:56.619
Hyah!

34:07.804 --> 34:08.891
Yes! Yes!

34:13.505 --> 34:15.246
Crusader.

34:18.248 --> 34:20.295
Crusader.

34:20.338 --> 34:21.862
Ooh!

34:21.905 --> 34:23.603
What do you want?

34:23.646 --> 34:27.083
I need a man with your
particular fighting skills.

34:28.259 --> 34:30.348
Leave me alone.

34:30.391 --> 34:33.221
I have money.

34:33.264 --> 34:34.744
I don't fight for money.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.666
If you don't
fight for money,

34:43.710 --> 34:45.407
then what do
you fight for?

35:00.030 --> 35:02.313
All right, we're in
and out before anyone notices.

35:02.337 --> 35:03.425
Come on.

35:59.742 --> 36:01.004
This way.

36:03.311 --> 36:04.573
And the bodies?

36:04.616 --> 36:06.314
Hide them in the vault.

36:15.062 --> 36:16.280
It's behind here.

36:28.292 --> 36:29.598
Torch.

36:40.391 --> 36:42.045
Gather all you can.
Quickly.

36:45.832 --> 36:47.572
That's it.

36:56.233 --> 36:58.409
Intruders!

37:07.244 --> 37:08.289
Guards!

37:11.074 --> 37:12.380
Trinity formation!

37:14.774 --> 37:16.210
Hold!

37:16.253 --> 37:18.342
Berenger, get the gold
out of here!

37:18.386 --> 37:20.301
Hold the line!

37:20.344 --> 37:21.955
This way. Go.
Go.

37:25.523 --> 37:26.916
Raynald!

37:26.960 --> 37:28.526
Keep the line!

37:28.570 --> 37:30.833
No! Raynald!

37:33.705 --> 37:34.794
Landry!

37:34.837 --> 37:37.057
Hold the line!

37:37.100 --> 37:39.146
Attack!

37:42.758 --> 37:45.108
Take it all out of here.
Go, go, go!

37:48.285 --> 37:49.721
Aah!

38:02.169 --> 38:03.735
Raynald!

38:03.779 --> 38:06.347
Kelton, Vasant, cover me.

38:12.353 --> 38:14.137
Hang on, Raynald.

38:22.711 --> 38:23.843
Get out of here! Go!

38:26.976 --> 38:31.415
Rhone, move!
We've got the gold! Let's go!

38:35.202 --> 38:36.681
Naimon!

38:42.209 --> 38:44.037
Rhone!

38:57.050 --> 38:58.790
Thank you.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.314
Initiates, let's go.

39:00.357 --> 39:02.098
Now.

39:02.142 --> 39:03.926
Let's go. Move!

39:27.384 --> 39:29.473
Draper, leave us.

39:36.741 --> 39:41.007
A man can be driven to madness
trying to comprehend God's will.

39:41.050 --> 39:43.444
To see
Brother Naimon fallen

39:43.487 --> 39:45.881
and an Initiate
with such promise,

39:45.925 --> 39:47.839
taken from this world,

39:47.883 --> 39:49.493
while another,

39:49.537 --> 39:52.757
unworthy of God's grace
yet draws breath.

39:52.801 --> 39:55.369
It threatens to
corrupt the mind.

39:55.412 --> 39:57.066
I didn't send them
on that mission,

39:57.110 --> 40:01.201
nor did I clutch the sword
that took them of that life.

40:01.244 --> 40:04.856
You needn't clutch the blade
to bear responsibility.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.076
I commanded you
to fall to formation,

40:07.120 --> 40:09.992
yet you disobeyed
my direct order.

40:10.036 --> 40:11.994
I was trying
to save Raynald.

40:12.038 --> 40:14.431
You were trying to
glorify yourself.

40:14.475 --> 40:17.043
Proof
you're no different

40:17.086 --> 40:19.436
than when you disobeyed
your Templar vows.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.003
I am no longer
that man.

40:21.047 --> 40:24.964
Your actions
speak otherwise.

40:25.007 --> 40:28.141
A Templar's mission is to
glorify God, not himself.

40:28.184 --> 40:31.013
But you have shown yourself
unworthy of being a Templar,

40:31.057 --> 40:34.495
as you are unworthy
of being an Initiate.

40:34.538 --> 40:36.671
The horse
you returned with...

40:36.714 --> 40:38.020
she'll be saddled
with supplies.

40:38.064 --> 40:39.848
Take her and leave.

40:39.891 --> 40:41.545
The Templar life
is not for you.

40:41.589 --> 40:44.287
It's for men committed
to the cause.

40:44.331 --> 40:47.203
Leave us, Landry...

40:47.247 --> 40:50.163
free of our rules,
free of our vows.

40:50.206 --> 40:54.210
Leave us
and never return.

41:29.898 --> 41:32.553
Checkmate.

41:32.596 --> 41:34.163
My apologies, Your Majesty.

41:34.207 --> 41:36.774
The Paris Temple has been
broken into and robbed.

41:36.818 --> 41:40.474
The Templars
entered my city?

41:40.517 --> 41:43.390
We can't prove that,
Your Grace.

41:43.433 --> 41:45.087
Can't we?

42:56.985 --> 43:00.206
What was so urgent you would
awaken my son and I from sleep?

43:00.249 --> 43:01.555
This, Your Majesty.

43:05.559 --> 43:08.605
The Templar defiles her
in life and in death.

43:11.521 --> 43:13.828
Why would he cut her open
like this?

43:13.871 --> 43:16.961
To remove the child.

43:17.005 --> 43:19.181
What would give him cause
to do such a thing?

43:23.751 --> 43:26.710
The baby is alive.

43:29.496 --> 43:32.760
Go away,
or I shall cut you in half!

43:39.158 --> 43:42.117
Ohh, has a more tragic fal
ensued

43:42.161 --> 43:44.206
since Lucifer was
cast out of heaven?

43:44.250 --> 43:47.253
A great and glorious
Knight of the Temple,

43:47.296 --> 43:49.385
perhaps the greatest swordsman
in all of Paris,

43:49.429 --> 43:52.867
reduced to
such a piteous state.

43:54.651 --> 43:56.784
Get out,
or I'll kill you!

43:56.827 --> 43:59.003
I did not come here to die,
Gawain.

43:59.047 --> 44:01.397
I came to offer you
renewed purpose.

44:01.441 --> 44:04.966
What need I of purpose?
Hmm?

44:05.009 --> 44:07.490
Purpose is what
brought me to this.

44:07.534 --> 44:09.884
Sometimes the seeds
of a man's destruction

44:09.927 --> 44:12.365
are also the seeds
of his redemption.

44:12.408 --> 44:15.672
After his fall, did not Lucifer
gain his own throne?

44:17.544 --> 44:19.850
I'm offering you
a second chance, Gawain...

44:19.894 --> 44:23.289
if you are not too far gone
to take it.

44:27.771 --> 44:29.773
I'm not the greatest swordsman
in Paris.

44:35.126 --> 44:39.174
The greatest swordsman
in all of France.
