00:01.335 --> 00:03.962
Previously on "The 100"...

00:09.093 --> 00:10.343
Welcome to
Mount Weather.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.054
Anya?

00:13.263 --> 00:14.764
OK, come on.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.225
There has to be another way.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.727
There isn't!

00:19.937 --> 00:20.937
Thank you.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.691
You killed 300
of my warriors.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.026
I can't show my face
without a prize.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.486
The grounders took them.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.696
The guy
with the one eye.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.406
He's got
Clarke's watch.

00:31.615 --> 00:34.617
Where is the girl who was
wearing this watch?!

00:36.996 --> 00:38.121
Let's get moving.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.664
Are we really going
to do this?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.082
Bring the ark to
the ground?

00:41.291 --> 00:42.500
Godspeed, my friends.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.168
There were multiple
crash sites

00:44.378 --> 00:45.545
over 100 square Miles.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.256
We're ready to go.
It's a missile.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.426
Our ancestors used them
to destroy the world.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.636
We're gonna use one
to get back to it.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.648
Anya, we've been
walking for hours.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.024
Where are we going?

03:12.234 --> 03:14.026
Quiet.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.070
Why not just kill me
and get it over with?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.281
You can tell the commander what
the Mountain men

03:18.448 --> 03:19.448
are doing to us in there.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.535
So let's work together.
We don't have to be enemies.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.163
And unite with someone
as weak as you?

03:25.372 --> 03:27.748
- I have what I need.
- Hey.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.084
We both want
the same thing.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.130
- Get down.
- They found us.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.093
Run.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.811
Everyone, eyes peeled.
We're in grounder territory.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.813
Everything is
grounder territory, all right?

03:51.023 --> 03:53.024
I can't keep running,
all right?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.359
We don't even know if the guy
Finn killed was telling the truth.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.944
Keep moving.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.946
- We can give him a minute.
- No, we can't.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.907
You heard what
that grounder said.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.034
"They'll outlive
their usefulness."

04:03.243 --> 04:05.494
I heard what he said when you had
a gun to his head.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.497
Look, you think I
wanted to do that?

04:08.707 --> 04:10.833
He would have told his people
we're coming,

04:11.043 --> 04:13.419
and by the time we got there,
our people would be dead.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.588
Maybe that's something
you can live with, but I can't!

04:15.797 --> 04:18.257
Hey, you did what you
think you had to do,

04:18.467 --> 04:20.218
but you are not
yourself right now,

04:20.427 --> 04:22.678
and I can't be out here
with another loose Cannon.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.263
Guys.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.858
Fall in.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.824
Where the hell
did they come from?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.203
From the ark.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.170
It's a rough
landing.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.923
There's nothing
we can do for these people.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.884
We got to go.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.638
Did you hear that?

06:32.642 --> 06:35.436
Hey. Hey, someone's
down there.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.605
- Hey!
- Please!

06:37.814 --> 06:39.231
Up here!

06:39.441 --> 06:41.275
Please, help me!

06:41.485 --> 06:42.777
Mel?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.612
Help me!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.322
You know her?
Shut up, Murphy.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.824
She's my friend.
We have to do something.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.161
Help me!

06:52.371 --> 06:54.705
Sterling, please!

06:54.915 --> 06:56.374
We can't stop.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.042
This isn't
a grounder, Finn.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.169
We have a rope.
You saw her.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.171
She'd never be able
to hold on to it.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.131
We'd have to lower
somebody down.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.176
It'll take time
that we don't have.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.470
- I hate this as much as you--
- I know.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.138
I--I know.
OK, I know.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.515
Just hold on!

07:12.724 --> 07:13.974
Just hold on, Mel.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.351
Sterling!

07:15.560 --> 07:17.311
We'll come back
for her.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.021
OK?

07:21.525 --> 07:23.192
Please!

07:23.402 --> 07:24.485
We're movin' out.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.070
Wait! Sterling!
Hey!

07:26.279 --> 07:28.364
I can't hang on!

07:28.573 --> 07:31.409
Well, it looks like we're
taking that break after all, huh?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.416
Man, on radio:
Be advised, the fence is live.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.042
Copy that.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.086
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fence is hot.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.088
Trust me,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.465
you do not want
to go near it.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.553
Careful.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.454
Reyes, there you are.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.038
Yes, sir.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.041
Dr. Griffin
cleared you for work. How's your leg?

08:21.251 --> 08:23.043
It's not a factor.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.421
What's the job?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.339
Need you to build
a radio beacon.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.301
If the other ark stations have
survivors, we need to know it.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.386
I'm on it.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.184
I got it.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.733
OK, report to engineering
and we'll get you started.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.818
Roger that.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.741
Thank you, sir.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.177
Drein Daun.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.762
Drein Daun.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.472
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.475
Hey.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.060
Wait, just a se...

09:27.359 --> 09:28.817
Ah.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.320
Mmm. Ah.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.284
Thank you.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.995
What's your name?

09:43.041 --> 09:45.751
Your name. You.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.379
Zoran.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.798
Zoran.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.300
Good name.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.054
I'm Thelonious.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.557
Thuh-lawn-us.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.601
Yeah.
Thee-lo-noose.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.948
Please,
I mean you no harm.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.491
Strangers are not
welcome here.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.535
Please!
I'm injured! Please!

10:25.000 --> 10:26.709
Quiet.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.544
You can't even walk
in the woods.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.171
If I'm such a burden,
then cut me loose.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.591
Heavy footfalls,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.801
broken branches.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.761
You even smell like them.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.778
Down.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.657
No. Not to drink.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.744
Then why stop?
We should be running.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.123
You reek.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.208
Cover yourself in it.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.806
I'm almost there!

11:23.016 --> 11:24.850
Once I have her,
pull us up!

11:26.728 --> 11:28.312
Well, I'd say he's
heard one too many

11:28.521 --> 11:29.897
of your
motivational speeches.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.565
Shut up, Murphy.

11:42.786 --> 11:46.038
Give me your hand.
It's OK, Mel.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.165
OK.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.250
I got you. All right.
OK.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.752
I got you--

12:01.388 --> 12:03.430
All righty.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.100
I got you, OK? Give me your hand.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.857
You'll be all right.
I got you.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.238
Sterling!
Sterling!

12:19.447 --> 12:22.324
Aah...

12:35.422 --> 12:37.840
Mel! Mel, hold on.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.468
Focus on me.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.720
You can do this.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.221
Oh, no!

12:44.431 --> 12:46.473
Yes, you can.
You're strong.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.642
I'm not strong!

12:48.852 --> 12:50.769
Stubborn, maybe.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.105
So be stubborn
a little longer.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.900
I'm not gonna
let you die, you hear me?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.027
OK.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.367
We're out of rope.
So we make a new one.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.411
If anything happens
to our friends, when we could--

13:07.620 --> 13:09.037
we don't know if we could
save our friends.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.498
For all we know,
they may be dead already.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.333
We've all
thought it.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.503
But what we do know
is we could save this one girl.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.758
Sterling was one of us.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.968
She was his friend.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.845
I'm in.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.056
How do we do it?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.142
We make new rope
from the wreckage.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.728
Go find wires,
seatbelts, anything.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.229
Come on.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.689
Come on.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.818
I hope you're right
about this.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.822
So do I.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.554
You said I wasn't
welcome here.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.892
Zoran's father thought
I should let you stay.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.020
Then I should thank him.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.940
He is gathering
supplies.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.033
You speak English.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.038
I was aiming for the eastern
United States. Did I make it?

14:33.248 --> 14:35.082
This is the dead zone,

14:35.291 --> 14:37.709
on the way to
the city of light.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.839
I am sienna.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.466
You must eat,

14:44.676 --> 14:46.552
then rest.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.995
Good.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.706
Mmm! Thank you.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.626
Is the city of light
your home?

15:19.836 --> 15:21.587
It will be,

15:21.796 --> 15:22.880
if we can find it.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.553
Oh, God.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.849
Zoran!

15:35.393 --> 15:38.353
I--I'm sorry.
He surprised me.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.608
We're used to
the hatred.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.111
I have no room for hate.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.282
What happened to him?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.121
He was born that way.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.457
It happens sometimes.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.001
Radiation.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.045
Fate.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.925
When such
a child is born,

16:08.134 --> 16:09.968
we leave it out,

16:10.178 --> 16:12.346
let nature
reclaim it,

16:12.555 --> 16:15.390
to erase the stain
from the bloodline.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.561
How could you do that?

16:19.771 --> 16:22.648
That is our way.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.818
I knew what was
expected of me.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.407
I could not give up
my child.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.871
We left our home so
that he might live.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.415
You chose to leave
your people?

16:40.625 --> 16:43.126
He is my son.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.190
What the hell are you doing
in here, wrench monkey?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.152
Helium, wick? Really?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.321
Ark welders aren't toys.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.032
Come on, Reyes. You got to enjoy life.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.076
You enjoy enough
for everybody.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.913
So, still dreaming up designs the
rest of us will have to fix?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.915
Hey, my designs
are elegant.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.792
If only they were
realistic.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.504
Well, it's been real,

17:27.714 --> 17:29.548
but I have a beacon
to work on.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.925
In that case,
welcome to my party.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.511
Schematics are over
here on the bench.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.097
You already designed it?

17:37.306 --> 17:39.766
Yep...We're using
parts we salvaged

17:39.976 --> 17:42.144
from the station's debris field.
Obviously.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.187
Oh, also,

17:44.397 --> 17:46.273
I have a little
something for you.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.946
What a piece of crap.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.240
You're welcome?

17:55.450 --> 17:58.243
I can get around
just fine.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.455
What you need to worry about
is countering the Mountain effect.

18:01.664 --> 18:02.706
That's your job.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
Damn engineers.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.877
Damn mechanics.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.186
How are they still
following us?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.438
Because of you.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.690
Time to end this.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.358
Anya, I am stepping
where you step.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.153
I'm covered in mud.
We're not leaving a trail.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.283
They're
following something.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.993
They're not
following us.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.787
They're tracking us.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.038
Search yourself.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.706
If I'm right, it
should feel like a--

18:44.916 --> 18:47.501
a small bump just
under your skin.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.005
Oh.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.175
It's you.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.220
OK, I could remove
it, but you need to untie my hands.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.473
I just need something sharp
and sterile.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.476
Aah!

19:09.607 --> 19:11.566
I will not go
back there.

19:17.532 --> 19:20.075
All right.
Ease it out slowly.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.591
Just hang on.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.635
I'm almost there.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.774
It's OK.
I got you. I got you.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.776
Just put your arms
around me.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.736
I can't.
Yes, you can.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.738
It's OK.
This will hold.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.907
I'll get you up.
I promise.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.910
OK. OK.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.922
I got her!
Pull us up!

20:16.132 --> 20:18.216
Don't you worry, Bellamy.
I won't drop you.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.177
Just pull, Murphy.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.225
Hey.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.769
I'm changing the tone frequency
to 400 hertz.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.272
It'll increase the radiated
modulation depth.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.816
Atmospheric noise will screw us.
So the signal's fainter.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.776
At least they'll know
we're out here.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.820
What's wrong?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.780
The current is not
getting high enough.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.991
We might as well be
shouting into the wind.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.285
We put an insulator between the mast
and capacity top hat.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.995
Already tried that.
Not working.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.789
Then you're
doing it wrong.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.082
Raven.
Don't worry.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.542
I'll fix it.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.960
I always do.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.420
Try my damn brace!

20:55.630 --> 20:57.505
Your damn brace sucks!

20:59.425 --> 21:02.928
Come on, raven.
Elbow grease ain't gonna fix this.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.305
What would you know
about elbow grease?

22:05.866 --> 22:07.659
Hey, come on.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.661
Let's go back to the work room.
We'll think it through.

22:09.870 --> 22:10.954
Leave me alone, wick!

22:11.163 --> 22:12.789
Rrr!

22:25.594 --> 22:28.638
Pull, Murphy!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.056
Aah!

22:31.726 --> 22:34.436
Come on!
A little help!

22:39.650 --> 22:41.985
Oh, no!
Pull! Pull!

22:44.113 --> 22:46.740
What the hell is
happening up there?!

22:46.949 --> 22:48.867
Just hold on!

22:49.076 --> 22:50.869
Grounders!

22:51.078 --> 22:53.121
Cover!

22:53.331 --> 22:54.789
How many are there?

22:54.999 --> 22:57.709
We can't see 'em!
In the trees!

22:57.918 --> 23:00.754
In the trees!
Aim for the trees!

23:04.425 --> 23:06.051
Aah!
No, no, no!

23:06.260 --> 23:07.385
Just hang on.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.766
Aah!

23:12.975 --> 23:14.726
We're gonna need to cut her loose.
We can't do this.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.519
Bellamy, you got
to cut her loose!

23:16.687 --> 23:17.479
No way!

23:17.646 --> 23:19.856
Cut her loose!

23:25.696 --> 23:27.947
Acid fog.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.449
Monroe, get back
on the rope!

23:29.658 --> 23:31.534
Come on!

23:55.851 --> 23:57.310
Thank you.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.020
Thank you.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.613
We have to take
cover from the fog.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.074
Bellamy.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.537
No, we don't.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.124
She blew the horn.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.750
Octavia.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.777
Bring me down, Reyes.

24:49.572 --> 24:53.074
Hey, you know why you're
working on the beacon?

24:53.284 --> 24:55.577
I'm not.

24:55.786 --> 24:56.494
Find someone else.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.122
Because I asked for you.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.874
You're the best
mechanic we got.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.543
Go me. Exactly three mechanics
made it to the ground.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.170
You were top-3
on the ark, too.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.838
I say this even
though you refuse

25:07.047 --> 25:08.798
to acknowledge
the ingenuity of my designs.

25:09.008 --> 25:13.094
Stop.
Or insanity.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.722
Listen, you have
a first-rate mind.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.349
You do. Use it.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.268
Your leg's messed up,

25:20.478 --> 25:21.895
and that blows.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.606
Figure out a way
to work around it.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.235
How do I do that?

25:29.445 --> 25:33.281
You could let your
friends help, for one.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.408
The rest,

25:35.618 --> 25:38.119
it's up to you.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.608
What do you know?

26:53.696 --> 26:55.822
It holds.
Barely.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.408
Oh, whatever! My design worked!
You can admit it!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.994
Whatever. This thing's an offense
to mechanics everywhere.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.579
You're welcome.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.749
Helium.
Argon!

27:06.959 --> 27:07.625
What? Are we not

27:07.793 --> 27:08.418
just tossing out noble gases?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.044
No, you idiot!

27:10.254 --> 27:13.131
I know what we have
to do to raise the beacon.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.065
Zoran.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.362
Zoran, please.
Come on.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.823
Come on.
Please.

27:43.704 --> 27:47.498
And you don't--you don't
need this for me.

28:03.265 --> 28:06.225
I have something
for you.

28:20.449 --> 28:21.783
What is it?

28:21.992 --> 28:24.202
So you do speak
English.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.079
Not to strangers.

28:26.288 --> 28:27.872
It's all right.
Heh!

28:28.082 --> 28:31.376
Well, we're not
strangers anymore.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.753
It's called
a chess piece.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.088
The black knight.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.007
The game teaches
long-term strategy.

28:40.678 --> 28:43.179
Taught my son how to play when
he was about your age.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.016
Where is
your son now?

28:50.312 --> 28:51.646
Dead.

28:55.109 --> 28:57.985
I chose different
from you.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.488
I put my people
first.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.032
Your people must
be very important to you.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.077
So was my son.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.392
Anya, you're
still bleeding.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.145
At least let me bandage it before
it gets infected.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.028
I can find
my way home from here.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.201
Looks like you're
my prisoner now.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.839
You must go!

30:00.048 --> 30:01.841
Quick!

30:02.050 --> 30:05.636
Come with me! Come with me!

30:11.101 --> 30:12.643
There.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.857
Look at the Ridge.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.201
Who are they?
Bad men.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.827
They're coming for you.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.454
No one comes
to the dead zone.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.664
They must have seen you
fall from the sky.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.167
You have to run, now.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.169
If they expect
to find me,

30:38.378 --> 30:40.129
what happens to you if they don't?
Go!

30:40.339 --> 30:43.090
Go before they see you.
We can take care of ourselves.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.026
Thank God you came
when you did.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.237
I was going back to camp
when I heard shots.

31:04.446 --> 31:08.115
Nice foghorn.
What happened to your boyfriend?

31:12.079 --> 31:14.372
He's gone.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.457
All right.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.090
Hey.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.053
I'm sorry, o.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.309
The grounders
will be back,

31:35.519 --> 31:37.270
so we need
to go, now.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.897
Yes, we do.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.984
Octavia says the arrow
might be poisoned.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.735
I have to
take them home.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.821
I know.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.367
I'll meet you
as soon as I can.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.369
I know.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.667
Parting,

31:59.877 --> 32:01.335
such sweet sorrow,
right?

32:01.545 --> 32:03.921
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

32:04.131 --> 32:06.507
Come on.

32:06.717 --> 32:09.176
Bellamy, you know if I go with you,
they'll just lock me up again.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.935
Really?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.737
Watch his back.

32:36.872 --> 32:39.415
I can't get them home
without you.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.542
Of course you can't.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.669
Let's go.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.884
Anya, wait.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.053
Aah!

33:34.262 --> 33:35.179
Aah!

33:35.389 --> 33:36.806
Hey--

33:58.870 --> 34:00.079
aah!

34:01.915 --> 34:03.541
I don't want
to kill you, Anya.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.501
Then you're the one
that's gonna die.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.077
Aah!

35:28.168 --> 35:30.461
You fought well.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.546
Do you see that?

35:34.174 --> 35:36.008
I knew it.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.803
He lied.

35:39.012 --> 35:41.597
My people are
out there.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.566
So the balloon beacon
wasn't a bad idea.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.694
I think the word you're
searching for is "genius."

35:55.904 --> 35:57.321
You should have been
an engineer.

35:57.531 --> 35:58.948
You already have
the arrogance.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.367
Oh, that's what they
teach you. I wondered.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.370
Well,
that's one way to do it.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.373
What the hell
are you doing?

36:07.582 --> 36:09.375
Oh, it's
a radio beacon.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.418
Wrong.
It's a target.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.170
Hey,
wait a second!

36:15.465 --> 36:17.508
We fell from space

36:17.717 --> 36:19.635
in a football stadium;
I think they already know we're here.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.262
Chancellor Kane's out
risking his life

36:21.471 --> 36:23.055
to negotiate
with the grounders.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.682
You better hope he's successful,
because if he isn't,

36:24.891 --> 36:26.350
every grounder
within 50 Miles of here

36:26.560 --> 36:28.978
now knows exactly
where we are!

36:29.187 --> 36:31.272
I expected better,
chief.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.607
All guards
to the wall, now!

36:33.817 --> 36:36.193
You see a grounder,
you're authorized to shoot on sight!

36:36.403 --> 36:38.362
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go!

36:38.572 --> 36:41.115
Cover the perimeter!
Move!

36:49.708 --> 36:52.626
He won't run!
Please! They'll hurt him!

36:52.836 --> 36:55.713
If he runs,
they'll hurt us.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.222
Father?

37:05.223 --> 37:08.184
He brought
the bad man here?

37:09.352 --> 37:10.978
Mother, why are you
doing this?

37:11.396 --> 37:13.439
It's OK, Zoran.
Listen to your mother.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.191
You can still run!

37:15.400 --> 37:16.650
Please!

37:16.860 --> 37:19.278
If I do,

37:19.487 --> 37:22.573
that man will hurt your family,
and I won't let that happen.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.757
There is a bounty
on sky people.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.178
"Sky people"?

37:45.722 --> 37:48.641
We needed the horse to reach
the city of light.

38:00.862 --> 38:04.823
Yeah. To survive,
we do what we must.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.671
I hope you find
your new home.

39:26.072 --> 39:29.575
Look at that.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.577
How many are there?

39:31.786 --> 39:34.204
I don't know.

39:34.414 --> 39:37.291
A lot, I hope.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.426
I'm letting you go.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.803
I'm not weak,

39:50.013 --> 39:51.555
but I'm not
like you.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.557
Our only chance
against Mount Weather

39:53.767 --> 39:55.559
is if we fight
together.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.394
To beat them, we'll
need our technology

39:57.395 --> 40:01.815
and your knowledge
of this world.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.485
I know my people
will help.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.988
The question is,
will yours?

40:14.371 --> 40:17.331
The commander was my second.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.335
I can get an audience.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.593
Please hurry.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.477
Aah!

40:39.270 --> 40:40.437
Anya!

40:41.940 --> 40:42.981
Aah!

40:43.191 --> 40:45.359
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.611
No, no, no, no.

40:47.821 --> 40:51.281
No, no. Hey.
It's OK. No.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.705
No, no, no.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.375
Anya, you're OK.
You're OK.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.094
- Aah!
- Shot two more.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.721
Alpha team's got
two grounders down.
