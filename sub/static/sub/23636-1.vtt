00:33.250 --> 00:35.440
Ever since our island people
could remember,

00:35.550 --> 00:38.710
Bora Bora
had been the home of the gods.

00:40.190 --> 00:43.210
Home of Kanaloa,
King of the Underworld...

00:44.020 --> 00:47.390
of Pele,
the little mother of volcanoes...

00:48.230 --> 00:53.960
of Ta'aora, god of the ocean waters,
god of the winds and the storms,

00:54.070 --> 00:59.370
of Mano the shark, who guided his children
through secret pathways of the sea

00:59.470 --> 01:00.940
when they were lost,

01:01.040 --> 01:03.940
and of great Kane,
father of the universe

01:04.040 --> 01:06.810
and all that lived therein.

01:06.910 --> 01:11.980
And so it remained
until in the days of Kanakoa the King

01:12.080 --> 01:14.310
there came upon the people of this island

01:14.420 --> 01:18.220
the most terrible anguish
that can afflict the spirit of man...

01:18.320 --> 01:21.690
a time when the gods
began to change.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.960
For in that day there arose a new god

01:25.060 --> 01:30.970
whose appetite for human sacrifice
heaped the altars high with his dead...

01:31.070 --> 01:35.870
Oro. Oro whose eyes
were the eyes of death.

01:35.970 --> 01:40.140
So King Kanakoa
called together his people and said,

01:40.250 --> 01:45.380
"This new god, this Oro,
is a god of vengeance and wrath.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.470
Let us run away from him."

01:50.760 --> 01:54.050
The State Canoe of Bora Bora
was the swiftest vessel

01:54.160 --> 01:57.220
in all the oceans of the world.

01:57.330 --> 02:01.100
They filled it with roots and seeds
to plant in a new land

02:01.200 --> 02:05.140
which, legend told them,
lay far to the north.

02:05.240 --> 02:09.610
From its holy place
they took the sacred stone,

02:09.710 --> 02:12.070
the image of gentle Kane,

02:12.180 --> 02:14.610
and guided by Mano the shark,

02:14.710 --> 02:19.310
set out through uncharted seas
towards the unknown,

02:19.420 --> 02:22.580
until at last they approached
the shores of a land

02:22.690 --> 02:29.180
never seen before by the eyes of men,
the glowing land that was Hawaii.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.990
For over 30 generations
they lived in that land,

04:37.090 --> 04:39.250
remote from the rest of the world,

04:39.360 --> 04:44.090
content in the worship of Kane,
until you came,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.390
and my people found themselves
once more in a time

04:47.500 --> 04:49.230
when the gods were changing.

04:52.070 --> 04:55.940
You who have trained
for your ministries here at Yale College,

04:56.040 --> 04:59.070
and only yesterday
received your diplomas,

04:59.180 --> 05:03.270
cannot begin to imagine
what that can do to the human soul.

05:04.380 --> 05:07.510
Even the Reverend Dr. Thorn
finds it unbelievable

05:07.620 --> 05:12.720
that only 43 years ago, when the English
Captain Cook arrived in Hawaii,

05:12.820 --> 05:16.990
my brothers stood for the first time
face to face with a Christian world

05:17.100 --> 05:20.060
whose existence
they had never even dreamt of.

05:21.670 --> 05:25.660
We beheld your weapons,
your tall ships,

05:25.770 --> 05:28.170
your way with books and numbers,

05:28.270 --> 05:31.470
and we could not doubt the greatness
of your Christian God.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.450
In less than one generation
we leveled our temples,

05:37.550 --> 05:39.710
burnt our pagan idols,

05:39.820 --> 05:45.120
and stood like waiting children for
the revelation you promised to send us.

05:46.760 --> 05:51.490
But instead of sending God's words,
you sent adventurers to steal our lands...

05:52.600 --> 05:55.460
pestilence to ravage our countrysides,

05:55.570 --> 05:59.160
strong drink to devour
the manhood of our sons,

05:59.270 --> 06:02.400
and devils in the shape of whalers
to despoil our daughters

06:02.510 --> 06:05.270
and cast them aside
like little wounded animals...

06:06.040 --> 06:10.410
to die in torment of that disease
for which we had no name

06:10.520 --> 06:11.880
until you came.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.650
We hunger for the word of God.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.790
Yet in the four years
I've lived among you,

06:18.890 --> 06:23.120
no one yet has said to me,
"Keoki Kanakoa,

06:23.230 --> 06:27.560
I will go with you to Hawaii
to save the souls of your people."

06:30.840 --> 06:32.830
I am coming, I am coming!

06:38.540 --> 06:40.980
- It's past 3:00.
- I'm sorry, Reverend Thorn.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.780
You said the lists were closing tonight,
and Brother Hale and I

06:43.880 --> 06:47.370
- decided to volunteer for Hawaii.
- You have? Come on in.

06:48.120 --> 06:52.320
Why did you not stand forth with
the others at a more appropriate hour?

06:52.420 --> 06:56.360
I wasn't sure of my worthiness, sir.
I asked Brother Whipple to stay with me

06:56.460 --> 06:57.590
and pray for God's direction.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.960
I assume the Lord
has spoken to you again?

07:00.060 --> 07:01.730
He has, sir.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.630
When Prince Keoki spoke tonight,

07:03.740 --> 07:07.000
I heard the voice of God
commanding me to go to Hawaii

07:07.110 --> 07:08.830
and bring His word to the heathen.

07:08.940 --> 07:11.100
It was clearer
than the personal revelation

07:11.210 --> 07:14.340
I experienced when I was only 15,
that mystical...

07:14.450 --> 07:15.430
Yes, I remember.

07:16.210 --> 07:19.480
I am very pleased that you
are volunteering, Brother John.

07:19.580 --> 07:21.750
I'd always thought that as a doctor

07:21.850 --> 07:24.850
you were more interested
in medicine than in theology.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.360
Tonight I realized I could serve God
in both capacities.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.930
You should hear from the board
of commissioners within the week.

07:32.030 --> 07:34.160
Thank you very much,
Reverend Thorn.

07:34.270 --> 07:36.890
- I promise I will...
- Your case will take longer.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.000
- Why?
- Your teachers tell me

07:40.100 --> 07:42.630
that you were somewhat
proud of your sanctity.

07:42.740 --> 07:46.200
The Lord God Jehovah
is not your uncle, Brother Hale.

07:46.310 --> 07:47.610
He is your Creator.

07:47.710 --> 07:51.080
But every day I repeat
the biblical injunction against pride.

07:51.180 --> 07:55.380
- Proverbs 16:5: "Every one that is proud..."
- Yes, I...

07:55.490 --> 07:57.080
I know the verse.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.120
I presume that like most
of our young volunteers,

08:01.230 --> 08:04.130
you are still confronted
with the problem of finding a wife.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.960
No, sir. My cousin
has agreed to marry me.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.760
- I don't understand.
- You must have a wife.

08:09.870 --> 08:13.060
We do not send young men to live
among the naked savages without wives.

08:14.970 --> 08:18.700
At your age, you probably have
some dedicated female in view.

08:18.810 --> 08:19.830
No, sir.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.510
I haven't.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.210
No one at all?

08:32.490 --> 08:33.549
No, sir.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.490
I'll pray on the matter.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.220
It will require more than prayer,
Brother Hale.

08:42.570 --> 08:45.700
Sir, I beg you to accept me
on this mission.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.830
I promise that if you bestow upon me

08:47.940 --> 08:51.570
the holy privilege of saving
those poor souls in agony,

08:51.680 --> 08:55.700
- it will be a commitment to the...
- You will be hearing from us.

08:55.810 --> 08:58.580
Now, I really must insist
on bidding you good night.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.080
I assure you,
I have heard this call clearly.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.710
Yes, Brother,
you will be hearing from us.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.870
No, no, no, no,
I simply will not have it.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.380
The least you could have done was
consult with us before you wrote Jerusha.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.680
It might not be a bad thing, Abigail.

09:33.790 --> 09:36.120
Jerusha seems willing
to meet the boy, at least.

09:36.220 --> 09:40.680
My dear sister, the fact is
you have a daughter who is 22,

09:40.790 --> 09:44.230
and she grows more confused
and depressed each day.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.760
That's not true!

09:46.400 --> 09:49.960
It's only since Captain Hoxworth
she's had these... depressions.

09:50.070 --> 09:51.190
But that's the point!

09:51.300 --> 09:54.100
All this mooning around over
a damn sailor she hasn't heard from

09:54.210 --> 09:56.040
in almost two years, it's unnatural.

09:56.140 --> 09:59.470
But this Hawaii,
we don't even know where it is.

09:59.580 --> 10:02.980
Charles, are you willing
to send your daughter...

10:03.080 --> 10:05.910
My dear, the only thing I'm not willing
to do is abandon my child

10:06.020 --> 10:09.680
to fits of depression and religious mania
in a small upstairs room!

10:10.690 --> 10:13.160
If she can find love and a rich,
new life in Hawaii,

10:13.260 --> 10:15.560
It's a damn sight
better than she's doing here in Walpole,

10:15.660 --> 10:19.100
wasting away over a sailor
who's long since forgotten her.

10:22.730 --> 10:24.100
Abigail...

10:25.540 --> 10:28.100
Shouldn't we give
the young man a chance?

10:28.840 --> 10:31.500
If she doesn't like him,
she can send him away.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.370
I promise.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.660
Abner! A letter! A letter!

10:48.760 --> 10:52.860
"Dear Brother Hale,
as a result of careful inquiries,

10:52.960 --> 10:55.760
"the American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions

10:55.870 --> 10:58.100
"is happy in the will of God to announce

10:58.200 --> 11:01.690
"that you have been chosen
for mission duty in Hawaii.

11:03.310 --> 11:05.670
"Your acceptance, however,
is provisional,

11:05.780 --> 11:09.770
"since there remains the matter
of obtaining a wife to accompany you.

11:09.880 --> 11:14.750
"To this end, you would be well advised
to present yourself in one month's time

11:14.850 --> 11:19.760
"at the house of Charles and Abigail
Bromley in Walpole, New Hampshire,

11:19.860 --> 11:24.090
"there to meet their daughter,
a Christian girl of 22.

11:25.500 --> 11:29.090
"May I also take the liberty
of suggesting that in the interim

11:29.200 --> 11:34.230
"you work in your father's fields
each day with your hat off.

11:35.370 --> 11:38.210
Yours in Christ, Elifaleth Thorn."

11:38.310 --> 11:41.240
Do you think
she will accept you, Abner?

11:42.210 --> 11:43.680
If God wishes it.

11:44.380 --> 11:46.650
Let us pray together.

11:46.750 --> 11:53.180
Almighty God, look down with pity
on this miserable company of sinners,

11:53.290 --> 11:57.020
conceived in lust, delivered in evil,

11:57.130 --> 12:01.570
and slaves to every loathsome appetite
the flesh is heir to.

12:02.630 --> 12:09.060
We have held fast against atheism,
Romanism, Unitarianism,

12:09.170 --> 12:12.040
and a score of lesser evils.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.740
And we thank Thee
that Thou has chosen one of us

12:15.850 --> 12:20.440
to carry Thy holy word
and the precious light of John Calvin

12:20.550 --> 12:24.250
to the wicked
and benighted heathen of Hawaii.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.810
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:53.050 --> 12:54.380
Welcome to Walpole.

12:54.490 --> 12:56.820
I trust you had
a reasonably pleasant journey.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.980
Yes, yes, indeed.

12:58.090 --> 13:01.080
The Reverend Abner Hale,
Mr. Charles Bromley.

13:01.890 --> 13:04.730
- I'm deeply honored.
- My pleasure, son.

13:04.830 --> 13:06.820
Come on.
I want you to meet the family.

13:06.930 --> 13:09.660
- Yes, but I had...
- I'll take care of your baggage.

13:09.770 --> 13:12.200
- Fine.
- You're a lot browner and tougher

13:12.300 --> 13:15.170
- than I expected you'd be.
- I always was tough, sir.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.740
Reverend Thorn!

13:22.850 --> 13:25.870
A packet of delayed mail
and a letter came for the Bromleys.

13:25.980 --> 13:28.320
- Would you take them along?
- Thank you.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.930
That's him, isn't it?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.560
I think so.

13:46.270 --> 13:51.000
- But he's so tall!
- It's not that he's tall, he's just so skinny!

13:51.110 --> 13:53.940
He's not very handsome, either.
Do you think?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.740
No. He's got an awfully big nose.

13:57.980 --> 13:59.240
They're coming in. Come on.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.190
- Don't push!
- Quiet!

14:04.490 --> 14:06.790
Mommy doesn't look
as if she likes him.

14:06.890 --> 14:09.330
Papa's using his funny voice.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.550
Yes, how do you do, Reverend?

14:23.270 --> 14:25.770
And this is my daughter, Miss Jerusha.

14:28.150 --> 14:30.080
I'm pleased to make your
acquaintance, Reverend Hale.

14:43.430 --> 14:44.450
Oh, dear!

14:49.330 --> 14:50.460
Did I spray?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.670
No, no, no, not at all.

15:02.580 --> 15:04.640
Well, what did you think of him?

15:04.750 --> 15:07.720
- I rather took to the lad myself.
- He is simply dreadful.

15:07.820 --> 15:10.180
- Oh, Abigail.
- And what you are doing is shameful.

15:10.290 --> 15:15.280
If she accepts that scrawny
weed of a man, it will be out of despair.

15:15.390 --> 15:16.950
My dear sister.

15:17.060 --> 15:20.360
We must leave it all
in the hands of the Lord.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.170
Come in.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.600
You have a very kind nature,
Miss Bromley.

15:33.710 --> 15:34.680
Thank you, Reverend Hale.

15:35.780 --> 15:39.440
But then, I have always admired
the character of Jerusha

15:39.550 --> 15:41.350
as set forth in Holy Scripture.

15:42.390 --> 15:47.450
I think particularly on 2 Kings 15:33.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.890
"Five and twenty years old
was Jotham when he began to reign,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.490
"and he reigned 16 years
in Jerusalem.

15:55.600 --> 16:01.200
And his mother's name was Jerusha,
the daughter of Zadok."

16:01.310 --> 16:04.400
- It's a lovely verse.
- Yes, it's beautiful.

16:04.510 --> 16:05.670
Thank you.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.240
Thank you.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.210
I often think...

16:14.650 --> 16:15.620
Save the soup!

16:23.530 --> 16:29.490
Oh, my raggedy, taggedy,
little old scraggedy wishing doll

16:29.600 --> 16:34.130
I'd see two fleecy clouds caress

16:34.240 --> 16:37.640
And they become
a snow white party dress

16:37.740 --> 16:41.300
For my wishing doll

16:41.880 --> 16:45.040
And every rainbow way up there

16:45.150 --> 16:52.850
Becomes a silken ribbon for the hair
of my wishing doll

16:52.960 --> 16:55.190
And then one day...

16:58.230 --> 16:59.250
Reverend Hale.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.960
Are you feeling better?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.770
Oh, very much better, thank you.

17:11.109 --> 17:13.369
Will you stay a week
if it takes that long?

17:13.480 --> 17:16.450
- What takes?
- If you don't ask her, the captain will.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.210
Charity...

17:18.319 --> 17:19.609
All right.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.930
Only this morning as I awakened
and looked out the window,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.160
I thought with...

17:42.810 --> 17:46.170
with Virgil,
"Here is Spring eternal!"

17:49.250 --> 17:50.910
Will you have sugar?

17:51.020 --> 17:52.070
If you please.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.740
Or...

17:55.150 --> 17:59.180
Or with Theocritus,
"It is Spring everywhere,

17:59.290 --> 18:02.560
"and in the pastures
the udders are swelling with milk

18:02.660 --> 18:04.720
and the lambkins are suckling."

18:07.330 --> 18:10.360
- Cream, Reverend Hale?
- Thank you.

18:12.970 --> 18:15.870
One is also reminded
of the divine Milton...

18:18.710 --> 18:20.900
Let... let... let me...

18:33.320 --> 18:34.880
I have no graces.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.850
I'm strange and awkward in... in...

18:38.830 --> 18:40.460
worldly surroundings.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.800
But until now I've always
thought myself at least an honest man.

18:44.570 --> 18:46.630
I have no taste for poetry.

18:46.740 --> 18:50.000
I memorized those lines
to make you think better of me.

18:50.740 --> 18:55.340
I even... Iooked up your name
in my Bible concordance.

19:08.260 --> 19:11.230
My little sister's remark
about a certain captain...

19:12.030 --> 19:15.290
I think I should tell you that
two years ago I fell in love

19:15.400 --> 19:17.920
with a New Bedford man
who came here on a visit.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.630
However, we've not
corresponded since that time.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.110
I'm now quite free.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.880
He was a whaler, a strong man,
somewhat rough in his ways.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.140
Yet also gentle.

19:34.450 --> 19:35.920
And very handsome.

19:42.290 --> 19:43.490
Miss Bromley...

19:45.600 --> 19:47.590
You will find someone else.

19:48.500 --> 19:54.600
When that happens, I pray he'll be
the strongest, gentlest man on Earth.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.810
And the handsomest, too.

20:05.220 --> 20:06.980
I'll be going home tomorrow.

20:11.990 --> 20:15.080
I cannot think it right
for a young woman of your breeding

20:15.190 --> 20:21.500
to travel across 18,000 miles
of stormy seas to a savage land...

20:21.600 --> 20:25.090
I know all about Hawaii.
Prince Keoki lectured at our church.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.760
It is horrible.

20:26.870 --> 20:31.360
My life will be one of work,
poverty, bad food...

20:32.740 --> 20:36.840
living in a grass hut
surrounded by filth and savages.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.850
Why do you try to make Hawaii
seem even worse than it is?

20:46.960 --> 20:51.190
Because I will not spoil your life,
Miss Bromley.

20:51.300 --> 20:55.960
You are so beautiful,
and I am of such little consequence,

20:56.070 --> 20:59.560
that I put the idea of marriage
completely out of mind

20:59.670 --> 21:01.430
the moment I saw you.

21:02.940 --> 21:04.500
Am I so little to you, then?

21:06.980 --> 21:09.280
You are more to me
than anyone can know.

21:09.910 --> 21:13.910
My feelings for you
are of such a deep and tender nature,

21:14.020 --> 21:16.680
so profoundly affectionate,
that l... I...

21:17.350 --> 21:19.020
I dare not mention them.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.620
But you have dared.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.450
And in doing so
you have dishonored me.

21:27.770 --> 21:29.460
But, Miss Bromley!

21:31.300 --> 21:32.430
How?

21:33.400 --> 21:36.340
No gentleman would explain his feelings
so explicitly to a lady

21:36.440 --> 21:39.000
without previous
proposal of marriage.

21:39.110 --> 21:40.130
But I...

21:41.550 --> 21:45.680
You wouldn't think
of going to Hawaii with a man like me.

21:45.780 --> 21:46.910
Would you?

21:47.790 --> 21:49.510
Not if he wasn't my husband.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.380
Goodness!
I certainly didn't mean to imply that!

22:03.630 --> 22:05.660
I would protect you...

22:06.700 --> 22:07.970
and cherish you...

22:09.070 --> 22:11.870
and love you all the years of my life...

22:13.080 --> 22:16.140
if only you could find it in your heart

22:16.250 --> 22:19.040
to... marry me.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.250
It is in my heart.

22:28.060 --> 22:31.490
"There is a prince and a great man
fallen this day in Israel."

22:33.100 --> 22:35.120
I looked your name up, too.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.100
- Mom, he did it!
- Mom!

22:50.510 --> 22:54.470
You have set forth
as one family in Christ.

22:56.420 --> 23:00.220
Everything you possess,
both now and in the future,

23:00.320 --> 23:02.520
belongs to that family.

23:03.230 --> 23:05.630
You will receive no salaries,

23:05.730 --> 23:10.030
neither will you engage
in any enterprise for personal gain.

23:11.070 --> 23:15.900
I have no doubt that you would do
conspicuously well in business,

23:16.010 --> 23:19.570
but you have been called
to serve the Lord,

23:19.680 --> 23:24.940
and it is to this business
that you must attend.

23:25.050 --> 23:29.880
You are directed to accomplish
two divine missions...

23:29.990 --> 23:34.920
to bring the heathen to the Lord
and civilize him.

23:35.030 --> 23:41.120
You will lift up the heathen,
step by step, until he stands with you,

23:41.230 --> 23:47.300
and before you leave the scene,
the pulpits you erect will be filled by him.

23:48.610 --> 23:53.370
You are to spend yourselves
in Christ so generously

23:53.480 --> 23:57.040
that in later years
it may be said of you,

23:57.150 --> 24:01.020
"They came to a nation in darkness,

24:01.120 --> 24:04.020
they left it in light."

24:13.000 --> 24:14.290
Ready, Captain Janders.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.370
Reverend Thorn.
Land the gangplank!

24:17.470 --> 24:20.030
- Let go forward.
- Let go forward, sir!

24:20.140 --> 24:21.700
Let go aft!

24:21.810 --> 24:23.170
Let go aft, sir!

24:23.270 --> 24:27.870
Blest be the tie that binds

24:27.980 --> 24:33.310
Our hearts in Christian love

24:33.420 --> 24:40.520
The fellowship of kindred minds

24:40.620 --> 24:45.650
Is like to that above

24:58.880 --> 25:03.010
And you must submit your will
entirely to God's keeping.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.840
You are correct on that, Reverend.

25:04.950 --> 25:07.710
If you're ready,
I'll be proud to count you the first.

25:07.820 --> 25:11.050
I'm not half ready, Reverend.
I love to hear you nag.

25:11.150 --> 25:13.920
We haven't had such a fine gab
in many a passage.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.960
He's at it again, Captain.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.380
Reverend Hale!

25:19.300 --> 25:21.960
I thought I told you to leave
those men alone.

25:25.170 --> 25:27.600
You forbade me to enter the forecastle.

25:27.700 --> 25:31.940
But you did not forbid me to bring them
the word of God while they are at work.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.140
What word were you bringing
to young Cridland?

25:34.240 --> 25:36.080
He kept the whole watch
awake last night

25:36.180 --> 25:38.980
hollering in his sleep about
hell fire and damnation.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.680
I reminded him briefly of his sins

25:41.790 --> 25:44.450
and read certain passages
from the Holy Bible.

25:44.550 --> 25:48.790
To an ignorant man,
the Bible can be a terrifying book.

25:49.930 --> 25:52.830
More than the profane novels
I observe in your cabin?

25:52.930 --> 25:57.890
Do you think that Smollet and Defoe
and Voltaire are profane?

25:58.000 --> 26:00.700
- They are damnable.
- Have you read them?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.830
Must I commit murder
to judge it a sin?

26:09.010 --> 26:12.500
Why is it with so many
attractive young people on board,

26:12.620 --> 26:16.310
it's always that mangy scarecrow
that's well enough to eat with us?

26:29.870 --> 26:32.560
Raise your spirits,
my dear friends.

26:32.670 --> 26:34.660
We are a full degree
nearer the equator.

26:34.770 --> 26:37.370
When will this dreadful rocking cease?

26:37.470 --> 26:41.430
Come, Brother Quigley.
You'll have your sea legs soon.

26:41.550 --> 26:42.880
Perhaps you'd care to shave.

26:42.980 --> 26:45.500
I can fetch you some hot water
from the galley.

26:45.620 --> 26:48.210
I don't know what we'd do
without your comfort.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.510
We are a family in Christ,
my dear sister.

27:00.700 --> 27:03.690
Would it compose you
if I were to read to you?

27:05.870 --> 27:07.430
Sister Urania?

27:14.810 --> 27:16.680
Abner, no good cheer, I beg you.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.250
Why, Brother John.

27:18.350 --> 27:23.080
I should think you, as a doctor, would be
the first to prescribe a cheerful face.

27:23.190 --> 27:26.780
As a doctor, Brother Abner,
I accept the truth.

27:26.890 --> 27:31.920
And the truth in this case
is that we are, all of us, except you,

27:32.030 --> 27:33.860
fit only for pickling.

27:37.070 --> 27:40.900
- Mrs. Hale?
- Reverend Hale, I'm so sick.

27:42.070 --> 27:45.560
You must pray.
And try to swallow back more firmly.

27:45.680 --> 27:48.610
- I do try.
- I know.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.510
It's Sunday again.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.510
Forgive me.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.520
You must be ready for services.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.420
I can't even raise my arm.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.950
I'll pray while you attend services.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.550
God's word will give you strength.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.570
Also the excellent pork and sea-pie
we are having for dinner.

28:23.580 --> 28:27.540
"Hear, O earth: Behold,

28:27.650 --> 28:33.060
"I will bring evil on these people, because
they have not hearkened unto my words,

28:33.160 --> 28:36.280
nor my law, but rejected it.

28:36.930 --> 28:41.520
I have seen thine adulteries
and neighings."

28:45.970 --> 28:47.870
The Lord has marked your presence,
Brother Quigley.

28:47.970 --> 28:50.440
You may go below to say prayers
with Sister Hale.

28:56.810 --> 28:59.440
"I have seen thine adulteries...

29:02.090 --> 29:03.640
"and neighings...

29:05.960 --> 29:07.860
the lewdness of thy whoredom..."

29:07.960 --> 29:09.550
That sounds like fun, don't it?!

29:12.930 --> 29:14.520
God will punish you for that!

29:16.870 --> 29:18.560
God will punish you for that!

29:19.200 --> 29:20.670
Perhaps at Cape Horn.

29:20.770 --> 29:22.640
We will soon be at the cape.

29:22.740 --> 29:25.140
Is it there
that the day of reckoning will come

29:25.240 --> 29:27.640
for those who refuse
to heed God's word?

29:27.740 --> 29:31.150
Will tides as high
as mountains engulf you

29:31.250 --> 29:35.510
and seawater fill your nostrils
and your lungs?

29:37.550 --> 29:42.390
Will your eyes drop from their sockets
at the bottom of the sea?

29:49.600 --> 29:52.730
Captain Janders,
since you have permitted blasphemy,

29:52.840 --> 29:54.830
I will dispense with the benediction.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.940
We will spend the rest of our Sabbath
in the main cabin,

30:00.040 --> 30:03.410
where Keoki will continue his instructions
in the Hawaiian language.

30:09.150 --> 30:11.020
Dutchmen and Spaniards
have done it.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.490
Some of our own whalers
have managed to get through.

30:13.590 --> 30:14.750
Why is it so difficult?

30:14.860 --> 30:17.490
It isn't, until the end.
See those rocks?

30:17.590 --> 30:18.720
The Four Evangelists?

30:18.830 --> 30:21.760
The Westerlies from the Pacific
pile up tremendous waves

30:21.870 --> 30:23.770
all the way along the exit
from the passage.

30:23.870 --> 30:27.130
In trying to break out,
they throw you onto the Evangels.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.750
Captain Janders!

30:43.850 --> 30:48.550
The Evangels are two points off
the starboard bow!

30:58.070 --> 31:00.870
Mr. Collins,
we're having a go at it!

31:00.970 --> 31:02.270
Aye-aye, sir!

31:02.370 --> 31:05.100
- Steady as she goes.
- Aye-aye, sir.

31:32.700 --> 31:36.900
Help! Reverend Hale!
Your wife!

31:37.010 --> 31:38.030
Mrs. Hale!

31:39.640 --> 31:41.080
- Mrs. Hale.
- We're lost!

31:41.710 --> 31:44.200
Let me die.
Please let me die!

31:44.310 --> 31:46.410
- What are you saying?
- God, let me die!

31:46.520 --> 31:47.810
- Mrs. Hale!
- Let me die!

31:47.920 --> 31:50.320
- You must not blaspheme!
- Please let me die!

31:52.920 --> 31:56.360
I'm afraid, too, my dear wife.
We must not despair.

31:56.460 --> 31:58.150
God is with this ship.

32:45.940 --> 32:48.670
She's slipping, sir!

32:48.780 --> 32:51.750
The Evangels are dead ahead!

32:53.620 --> 32:55.410
Send the gaff topsail!

32:55.520 --> 32:58.280
Loose the gaff topsail!

33:42.030 --> 33:43.860
Haul away!

33:44.070 --> 33:46.730
Haul away!

33:58.850 --> 34:00.480
Keoki!

34:41.020 --> 34:43.020
Help him, God.

34:44.830 --> 34:46.350
Help that man.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.840
Help that man!

35:09.890 --> 35:11.510
Strengthen his hands!

35:28.770 --> 35:30.970
- Haul away!
- Haul away!

36:02.910 --> 36:04.400
He is with us.

36:05.710 --> 36:06.730
He's with us!

36:27.900 --> 36:32.100
The Lord of hosts is with us!

36:33.240 --> 36:35.000
He is with us!

36:45.310 --> 36:47.870
- Are you sleepy?
- No.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.390
Forgive me.

36:50.490 --> 36:52.510
I'm not sleepy.

36:54.260 --> 36:55.660
I'm just relaxed.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.090
I felt so good after my bath, I...

37:01.200 --> 37:03.220
brushed my skin with oil of lilac.

37:04.170 --> 37:05.360
I smelled it.

37:06.570 --> 37:09.130
Moses forbade the use of perfume.

37:11.340 --> 37:15.940
Proverbs say that
"Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart."

37:18.410 --> 37:22.080
Isaiah cursed the woman who used
perfume and abased herself unto hell.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.290
Esther perfumed herself
for a whole year.

37:27.390 --> 37:28.950
She was under compulsion.

37:29.060 --> 37:31.420
I think she just liked
the smell of it on her skin.

37:31.530 --> 37:34.690
Skin is but flesh,
flesh is corruption incarnate.

37:36.330 --> 37:40.500
- The flesh was given us by God, too.
- As a burden, as a temptation.

37:43.740 --> 37:46.730
The temptation you are to me
at this very moment.

37:48.540 --> 37:50.880
That's one of the purposes
of marriage, isn't it?

37:53.620 --> 37:56.350
Not when it drives the thought
of God from the mind.

37:56.450 --> 37:58.610
I begin to feel that...

37:58.720 --> 38:00.620
that I'm utterly depraved.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.030
I think of nothing but your loveliness.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.760
Is it possible for anything to seem lovely
without God having wanted it so?

40:42.320 --> 40:45.720
Get away this ship.
We got too much preacher-man here.

40:52.730 --> 40:54.860
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

40:54.960 --> 40:57.020
He says his daughters
are the best...

40:59.470 --> 41:01.730
Are they his own daughters?

41:03.240 --> 41:04.230
Look!

41:04.340 --> 41:07.670
Look there!
There they are!

42:06.040 --> 42:08.370
- Who are they?
- Keoki's parents.

42:08.470 --> 42:11.200
Lahaina, here,
is the capital of the island of Maui,

42:11.310 --> 42:14.280
and Keoki's father, Kelolo,
is the king's deputy here.

42:14.380 --> 42:18.310
His mother is Malama,
and Alii Nui of all the islands.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.510
Where does the king live?

42:19.620 --> 42:22.180
In Honolulu, on the island of Oahu.
Break out the sling!

42:43.340 --> 42:45.070
Why did you kneel to your mother?

42:45.170 --> 42:47.770
She is the Alii Nui.
She is a sacred person.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.740
It's from her our mana flows.

42:49.850 --> 42:50.970
It is from God,

42:51.080 --> 42:54.680
not from any Alii Nui that you receive
your spiritual consecration.

42:54.780 --> 42:58.240
I understand, and so will they when
they become Christians, Brother Hale.

42:58.350 --> 43:01.980
- I was referring to the old religion.
- I think it would be better

43:02.090 --> 43:06.460
if from now on you referred to me
in the old way, as Reverend Hale.

43:06.560 --> 43:08.500
Abner!

43:08.600 --> 43:11.400
We agreed as a family
that we're all brothers and sisters.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.700
That applied only to ordained ministers
and their wives.

43:22.650 --> 43:25.740
Ordained or not,
I shall always be your sister Jerusha.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.750
Hoist away!

43:37.930 --> 43:41.420
Aloha, aloha!

43:51.610 --> 43:53.510
Aloha!

43:55.740 --> 43:59.270
Gently, gently.
Don't drop her or we'll all be massacred.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.740
Aloha! Aloha!

44:39.590 --> 44:41.890
My mother, Malama, says welcome.

44:41.990 --> 44:44.480
These are the first lhaole women
she has ever seen.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.320
Haole is our word
for people of the white race.

44:50.430 --> 44:54.030
She says that until now you have sent
only sailors and troublemakers.

44:55.870 --> 44:59.710
But since you bring your women,
your intentions must be good.

44:59.810 --> 45:02.300
Please express our thanks
to the Alii Nui.

45:02.410 --> 45:04.170
Tell her that in order to help her people

45:04.280 --> 45:06.710
we intend to establish missionaries
throughout these islands.

45:06.820 --> 45:09.940
I know little bit English already.

45:10.050 --> 45:12.580
How you meaning help my people?

45:12.690 --> 45:15.780
- Help them to know God.
- And reading, too, and writing.

45:15.890 --> 45:19.990
Writing?
This is good. It is our need.

45:20.100 --> 45:23.160
In one month time,
I learn plenty writing.

45:23.270 --> 45:25.060
But first you must learn about God,

45:25.170 --> 45:27.830
without Whose grace
all writing is useless.

45:29.100 --> 45:33.470
First write.
Then maybe I listen your god.

45:46.290 --> 45:48.760
She says you are adorable,
puny women.

45:48.860 --> 45:52.550
Will you tell her that
she and your father are very handsome?

45:52.660 --> 45:55.390
And that Lahaina
seems as lovely as New England,

45:55.500 --> 45:56.930
though in quite a different way.

45:57.030 --> 46:00.260
Alolha nui! Alolha nui!

46:00.370 --> 46:02.800
Alolha nui means love intense.

46:03.870 --> 46:06.770
I like you here.
You stay Lahaina.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.810
She teach me write.

46:08.910 --> 46:11.140
Alii Nui.
I'm not assigned to your island.

46:11.250 --> 46:12.680
My mission is in Honolulu.

46:14.050 --> 46:17.250
Where you go, I not care.
Her stay here.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.480
But Mrs. Hale is my wife.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.490
- She your wife?
- Yes.

46:25.360 --> 46:27.690
I let you stay, too. You come now.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.730
We can trade, Brother Hale.
Jephtha and I can go on to Honolulu.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.200
You and Sister Hale
can stay here in Lahaina.

46:35.300 --> 46:39.260
Her got plenty much mana.
Her one time wife with Kamehameha.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.470
Kamehameha had 21 wives.

46:41.580 --> 46:45.170
My mother is Alii Nui. So she's
entitled to other husbands as well.

46:45.780 --> 46:46.750
You mean...

46:46.850 --> 46:50.220
she was married to Kamehameha
and your father at the same time?

46:50.320 --> 46:53.760
She had to marry my father
because he is her brother.

46:53.860 --> 46:56.420
The Alii Nui may only have children
by her brother,

46:56.530 --> 46:59.120
otherwise her mana
would be profaned by outside blood.

47:00.630 --> 47:03.030
Water!
Please bring water, somebody!

47:34.360 --> 47:37.800
Reverend! Reverend!
Reverend?

47:37.900 --> 47:40.560
My name is Fredericks,
I have a little grog shop here

47:40.670 --> 47:42.260
and a few acres of farm land.

47:42.370 --> 47:44.130
I hope we are going to be friends.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.570
Grog shop?

47:45.670 --> 47:50.240
We'll discuss friendship when you stop
debauching my people with drink.

47:58.890 --> 48:02.120
Just one moment.
Just one moment, please.

48:02.860 --> 48:04.620
I will not permit us to be separated.

48:32.820 --> 48:34.620
Now, teach me write.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.960
Sit here, start teach.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.460
Perhaps we should begin tomorrow.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.290
We begin now!

48:51.870 --> 48:52.860
Well, I...

48:59.110 --> 49:02.640
In English, we have 26 letters.

49:02.750 --> 49:07.450
- But in Hawaiian...
- I need write letter you people, not mine.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.050
Teach English.

49:09.790 --> 49:10.820
English.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.530
Well, we'll start with your name.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.790
Malama.

49:18.730 --> 49:20.070
M...

49:27.510 --> 49:30.540
It is our family shrine.
We call it "heiau."

49:31.450 --> 49:33.280
It's for the Great Chiefs only.

49:33.380 --> 49:36.220
The center stone
comes from a temple in Bora Bora.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.480
It was brought here by my people
over a thousand years ago.

49:39.590 --> 49:41.220
Idolatry!

49:43.830 --> 49:45.890
Reverend Hale!
Reverend Hale!

49:49.970 --> 49:51.060
What is the meaning of this?

49:51.170 --> 49:53.660
- I had to stop you, Reverend Hale.
- No touch!

49:53.770 --> 49:57.830
It's an evil place drenched in blood.
It must be destroyed!

49:57.940 --> 50:00.140
It is not that kind of a temple.

50:00.240 --> 50:02.800
This is the temple of Kane,
a gentle god.

50:02.910 --> 50:04.500
- A god of love and mercy.
- No touch!

50:05.780 --> 50:07.210
This place is an abomination.

50:07.320 --> 50:11.380
It is, but until he understands,
we can't ask him to destroy it.

50:46.090 --> 50:47.920
Who is that naked female?

50:48.020 --> 50:50.750
Her my small, little daughter
named Noelani.

50:50.860 --> 50:54.390
One day she grow big and be
the Alii Nui the time when Malama die.

50:54.500 --> 50:55.990
Then she's Keoki's sister?

50:59.540 --> 51:03.530
One day her marry with Keoki.
Together, they get keikewalhine.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.300
Make one more Alii Nui.

51:08.180 --> 51:10.770
Reverend Hale?
This is my sister Noelani.

51:10.880 --> 51:14.580
Do you realize that your father
expects you to marry this girl

51:14.680 --> 51:15.910
and have children by her?

51:16.020 --> 51:19.450
- I will explain this to her later...
- No, now, make it clear now.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.490
I understand English,
Reverend Hale.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.120
Then you must also understand
that your brother is a Christian

51:25.230 --> 51:28.860
and any lustful union between you
is a damnable sin

51:28.960 --> 51:30.860
and must not take place.

51:42.710 --> 51:45.700
I wish I had been given
a little more time to prepare her.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.720
Could I go now
and come back tomorrow?

51:57.830 --> 52:00.730
No! While we waste time,

52:00.830 --> 52:04.530
lhaoles who know how to write
can steal this island.

52:04.630 --> 52:07.600
I'm sorry, I feel faint.

52:31.930 --> 52:37.130
This one baby
not come for long time yet.

52:37.230 --> 52:40.900
Better you sleep.
I make you work too hard.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.430
Rest, rest, rest.
Oh, rest.

52:50.010 --> 52:54.070
Jerusha is not a strong woman.
She'll not bear up well under pain.

52:54.180 --> 52:55.740
I'll try to be here when the baby comes.

52:55.850 --> 52:58.950
If not, this is the best book
on midwifery in existence.

53:00.360 --> 53:03.420
Keoki says the native midwives
are excellent, use them.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.630
Good bye, Brother Hale.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.000
Well...

54:34.320 --> 54:36.010
I guess we better...

54:51.570 --> 54:53.430
- Abner.
- Yes.

54:53.540 --> 54:54.500
Abner.

55:09.550 --> 55:11.040
What is your name?

55:14.990 --> 55:16.750
Iliki.

55:17.630 --> 55:19.920
You may go home now, Iliki.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.200
Apparently she's been...

55:36.980 --> 55:40.240
given to us by that woman.

55:41.150 --> 55:44.980
Do you suppose they actually
give children away?

55:47.290 --> 55:49.120
I'll ask her tomorrow.

55:51.860 --> 55:53.420
You may stay here if you wish.

56:10.410 --> 56:13.400
She's placed in our care
by the hand of God.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.320
She will become
the first member of my church.

56:20.590 --> 56:22.780
From the utter darkness,

56:22.890 --> 56:25.990
I will lead her into the light.

56:34.970 --> 56:36.490
I've already waited three weeks!

56:37.140 --> 56:38.470
I must see her.

56:48.520 --> 56:51.250
- What is it?
- This baby, she was gonna bury it alive!

56:51.350 --> 56:53.580
Let us through,
please, let us through.

56:57.830 --> 56:59.920
This baby got evil spirit.

57:00.030 --> 57:03.590
It isn't an evil spirit,
it's only a birthmark. Look!

57:03.700 --> 57:05.720
And see how fat and healthy he is!

57:05.830 --> 57:08.030
Bad thing.
More better he die quick.

57:08.140 --> 57:11.110
Does this killing of innocent children
go on all the time?

57:11.210 --> 57:14.000
Only sometime
they little bit sick, like this one.

57:14.110 --> 57:18.270
If such children are not wanted,
we will establish a home for them.

57:18.380 --> 57:20.180
They must not be killed!

57:20.280 --> 57:22.680
A wise Alii Nui
would make that a law.

57:22.780 --> 57:25.080
Too much law make people mad.

57:29.260 --> 57:33.020
She not kill him, Hale walhine.
Only feed him.

57:43.610 --> 57:46.170
We sit down, now.
Make another lesson.

57:46.270 --> 57:49.570
Alii Nui. If I may have a moment,
I've been trying...

57:49.680 --> 57:51.840
I learn English now.
Go away.

57:53.010 --> 57:57.110
It would only take a moment, Alii Nui.
He wants to talk about some land.

57:57.220 --> 58:02.160
- Land? You want land?
- Yes, I must have land in order to...

58:03.560 --> 58:04.890
I beg your pardon?

58:04.990 --> 58:07.390
No land! No like it!

58:07.500 --> 58:12.690
Every lhaole come here want land.
You go now.

58:12.800 --> 58:13.770
Teach.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.740
- If you will only permit me...
- No! Go away!

58:34.990 --> 58:37.250
He doesn't want the land for himself.

58:37.360 --> 58:39.830
And he doesn't want
very much land, either.

58:39.930 --> 58:42.920
Just enough to build a church on.

58:43.030 --> 58:49.230
- You like it, him build this church?
- Yes, I would like it very much.

58:50.940 --> 58:54.740
I tell Kelolo find little bit piece land,

58:54.840 --> 58:58.750
give men,
help build him his church.

58:58.850 --> 59:00.910
Now teach me.

59:34.580 --> 59:35.740
Makua Hale!

59:35.850 --> 59:39.220
Makua Hale, the Kahunas say
you put door bad place.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.950
The Kahunas!

59:41.060 --> 59:43.020
They come for help new kind god.

59:43.390 --> 59:45.720
He's not a new god,
he's the only God!

59:45.830 --> 59:48.350
And the Kahunas have nothing to do
with His church.

59:48.460 --> 59:52.370
They say more better no make wall.
Keep every side open.

59:52.470 --> 59:54.730
This make strong
when whistling wind come.

59:54.840 --> 59:57.500
Whistling wind?
What are you talking about?

59:57.610 --> 59:59.660
The kind wind
come when Alii Nui die.

59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.110
Nonsense.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.750
Makua Hale, I know this place.
Many time I talk with the spirits live here.

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:16.090
We will put the door where I say.
And there will be walls.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.920
Whoever heard
of a church without walls!

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.520
Makua Hale! Makua Hale!

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.360
You come see!

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:27.160
I have something for show you.
You read.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:34.200
"To James Monroe,
President of America in Washington.

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:40.040
"I send you 'AIoha'
from Lahaina on island of Maui.

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:44.590
"Some men from America,
too much do they want land.

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:48.490
"Also too many sickness do they bring.

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:55.390
"I think you like do something about it.
I write this with great love.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.930
Malama, Alii Nui."

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.600
It is a remarkable accomplishment,
Alii Nui.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.370
I think so.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.040
Little one.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:14.640
For thanks
because you teach me write,

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:17.380
I give you nice valley by Waiakoa.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.350
- Got stream with fishes.
- No, you mustn't give away your land.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.530
Makua Hale like land.

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.490
You have already given us this land,

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.360
to build a church for
Almighty God and His flock.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:35.130
We are very grateful for that.
But for ourselves we want nothing.

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:46.740
I think maybe this writing not enough.
Time now for teach me about your god.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.920
I'm pleased that you want to learn.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:53.080
Tomorrow we'll begin.

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:54.990
We begin now!

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:17.840
Tell me, this god,
how he look?

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:21.280
God is a spirit.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.080
He cannot be seen with the eyes.

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:30.390
He's seen only in the heart
of those who have found a state of grace.

01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:33.950
In one month time I find grace!

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.050
No, it cannot be done that way.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.760
To be saved you must first confess
that you are evil, corrupt, and sinful.

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:48.040
I evil, corrupt, sinful.
What is "sinful"? What it mean?

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.040
- It means "bad."
- I bad?

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:56.380
No! They bad, not me!
I am Alii Nui. I cannot be bad.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.850
In the eyes of God,
there is no difference

01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:00.980
between the Alii Nui
and her meanest servant.

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:04.860
God think
they equal to the Alii Nui?

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.890
God doesn't think, He knows.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.290
You have the sin of pride, Alii Nui.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.060
To find grace,
you must become humble.

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:15.900
- Humble?
- Humble.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.570
Are you humble?

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.840
I think maybe you proud, too.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:32.780
You find grace, then I find it!
You show me where right now!

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:35.980
That I cannot do!
Until you stop living

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.320
in incestuous marriage with Kelolo,
you will never find grace.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.490
Why Kelolo?

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.460
Because he is your brother.

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.330
And God forbids you
to live with him as his wife.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.000
But Kelolo is good.
No better men all this island like Kelolo.

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:57.510
No, Makua Hale,
I be too Ionely send him away.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.140
- Reverend Hale, if I may...
- Please.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.950
If you don't give him up,
you will burn throughout all eternity

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:07.180
in the blazing fires
of everlasting hell.

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.460
How hot this hell?

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.860
Hotter than the fires of a thousand
volcanoes. It burns incessantly.

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:22.370
Its pain is horrible
beyond imagining.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.680
Many years before I die.
Of Kelolo we talk another time.

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.120
Up we go.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.900
No! No! Come back!

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:37.110
Mr. Morris! Mr. Morris!

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.300
Yes, sir?

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:39.710
I'll have that one there.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.980
- You...
- No! That one there!

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:48.980
- Over here.
- Mr. Morris, that one definitely, there.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.320
- All right.
- What the hell, Mr. Morris.

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.520
- Send them all to my cabin!
- Yes, sir.

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.120
You want her for yourself?

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.090
Who the hell does he think we are?

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.730
How can you do this
to these innocent children?

01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:40.660
Have you no mothers at home,
no sisters?

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.330
May God in His mercy forgive you.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.970
Come back, Reverend,
I'll buy you a drink!

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.410
Go home, you wicked creature!

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.810
- I no do nothing bad!
- Go home!

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.900
Let that girl go!

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:17.160
Let her go!

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.910
Dillon! Let her go.

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.510
That's enough!
Stop it! That's enough.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:38.180
Stop it now.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.189
Rape is a rotten sport at any time.

01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:45.630
But in Lahaina,
it's a downright waste of energy.

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:49.189
Now get out of here and find yourselves
some cooperative ones.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:57.330
This is the daughter of our Alii Nui.

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:02.340
My compliments to the Alii Nui.
My apologies to you.

01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:03.470
Are you alright?

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:11.080
You bear the responsibility
for the depredations of your men.

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:14.060
I do.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.160
As God's instrument on Earth,

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:20.029
I order you
to take your sailors back to your ship!

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:25.430
My men are not sailors, Reverend.
They're whalers.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.660
And for over three years,
they've been on this voyage

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.569
and they haven't touched land
in eight months.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.939
Now, the females of Lahaina have
got the warmest blood in the Pacific,

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:37.569
and my men have neither the strength
nor the inclination to fight them off,

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.149
neither, might I add, have I.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.620
If you'll excuse me.

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:47.050
- Iliki came in crying...
- Jerusha!

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.870
- Rafer!
- Jerusha Bromley!

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.330
What are you doing here?

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.210
You're supposed to be in Walpole
waiting for me there!

01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:09.940
L... How could I have waited?

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:12.070
- You didn't write, I had no...
- Write?

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.590
I wrote from Canton,
from Manila, from Santiago,

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:17.280
from Honolulu...

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.980
Jerusha,
I've never seen anything so beautiful...

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:22.650
Captain, you may not
behave in that manner!

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.250
Shut up!
I'm speaking to Miss Bromley.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.660
Rafer, I'm married.

01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:28.630
Married!

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:32.230
Oh, my God, not to him!

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.570
What did he do,
pray you into bed?

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.910
For two years now,
I thought of nothing but you,

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:45.140
night and day, on sea and land,
nothing but you!

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:47.380
I'm not going to let you go
a second time.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:49.150
Abner, don't!

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:53.820
Stop it, Rafer!

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:56.490
Rafer, I'm expecting,
I'm with child!

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.330
Go away, go away!
Leave us alone!

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:09.340
I wanted you more
than anything else on this Earth.

01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:13.470
I could have taken you by candlelight
in your father's house, and you know that.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.810
May the Lord strike me dead if I ever
pass up another virgin as long as I live.

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.380
What a damn fool!

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.980
What a God-abandoned fool!

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:36.090
He's right. It's wrong
for the girls to swim out to the ships.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.400
Girls in Boston not swim out?

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.600
- Certainly not!
- Water too damn cold?

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:43.530
Not at all!

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.130
But the Alii of Boston
have made it against the law,

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.740
just as you should make it
against the law here.

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:53.550
I think missionary like stop
everybody have fun.

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.710
There's no fun in the disease
these girls catch from the sailors.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.410
There's only death.

01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:03.160
I think about it one more time.

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.820
To think about it is not enough.

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.900
You must make laws
to protect your people.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.560
Laws against killing,
against rum,

01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:14.330
and laws against
the damnable sin of adultery.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.370
- Adultery?
- Yes.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:19.880
That what he mean.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.340
What kind adultery
you not like too much?

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:23.570
What kind?

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.350
There's only one kind of adultery,
and it is a mortal sin.

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:30.750
Got 23 kind adultery
going on this place all the time.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.620
Married man sleep with
another married walhihe. That one kind.

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:37.820
Married man, he sleep
with wife his brother, that two kind.

01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:39.660
Married man
sleep with wife his son...

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:43.170
If we say there shall be
no adultery without saying which kind,

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:46.330
everyone would think,
"They don't mean our kind of adultery,

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.030
they mean the other 22 kinds."

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:52.510
On the other hand, if we list all 23 kinds,
somebody will surely say,

01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:54.940
"We never heard
that kind before, let's try it."

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.380
Father sleep with daughter,
that 11 kind.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.010
Mother sleep with son,
this 12 kind.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.850
Married walhihe sleep with brother,
this 13 kind.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.820
I think I see the problem.
I'll pray on the matter.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.220
Makua Hale! Makua Hale!

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:20.040
What is it?

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:23.070
Hale walhihe say
you run fast to house.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:24.900
What's the matter?

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:28.450
The baby!
Him wanna come out fast!

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:30.670
Better you make run like hell!

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:52.290
- Have the pains started already?
- Yes.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.100
Brother Whipple isn't due
for another three weeks.

01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.670
I know.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.170
Have you counted the pains?

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.740
- Nine or ten.
- Are they regular?

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.280
No, not yet.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.180
Do they make you
want to bear down?

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:11.250
- Then your water hasn't broken yet.
- No, be careful.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.220
- Then we have plenty of time
- Yes.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:16.350
Try to lie full length this way.

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:21.860
I'll get everything ready.
Tell me when the next pain begins.

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.230
Light the lamp.

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:54.700
Give it to me.

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:57.160
Tie these to the foot of the bed.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.910
Tell me when it's over.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.720
Now.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.620
It's going away.

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:53.950
- Who is it?
- It's Keoki, Reverend Hale.

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.390
I've brought the midwives.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.990
They have medicines
to kill pain and stop bleeding.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.330
Keoki, I do not want them.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:14.870
They have delivered many children,
Reverend Hale.

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.380
I will not surrender my wife
or my child to heathen practices.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.380
Tell them to go away.

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.790
Bring in a basin of boiled water.
Boiled, Iliki!

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.860
Then help Mrs. Hale
into her nightgown.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.840
Don't bear down anymore.

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:01.650
I can't help it.

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:04.190
You must hold back
on the next pain.

01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:08.590
What is it?
Is something wrong with the baby?

01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:10.290
Nothing's wrong with the baby.

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.790
Listen to me carefully.

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.330
It's in the breech position.
You remember what that is.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.030
You must hold back
on the next pain.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:23.110
Pant, breathe
through your mouth, anything!

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:24.400
But hold back!

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:28.610
I can't! I can...

01:18:40.230 --> 01:18:44.590
Listen, listen to me.
Jerusha, listen to me!

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.490
I've got to try
to turn the baby around.

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:53.040
The book said if it is not delivered
within three minutes, it will die.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.270
Do you understand?

01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:56.570
All right.

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.900
All right.
When the next pain comes...

01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:01.380
It's coming now.

01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:03.640
Scream if you want to!

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.010
Hold back!

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.020
No! No, don't push!

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.890
Hold back!

01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:16.150
Iliki, hand me the towels.
Quickly, Iliki!

01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:35.640
It's a boy, Jerusha.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.950
Is it normal?

01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:49.720
He's a strong, healthy boy.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.460
You may go, now.
Sleep.

01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:30.800
You know the kind way Hawaiians do
when baby come out wrong end like that?

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:39.830
Number one midwife, she kill the baby,
then she pull them out.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.550
Go away, Iliki.

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.530
I love you, Jerusha.

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:02.830
I love you.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.100
When I was a boy
and found God,

01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:14.300
I thought I could never love anyone
as dearly as I loved him.

01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:16.710
But I was wrong.

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.780
I love you more than I love God.

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:22.750
I love you.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.150
I love you.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.960
I love you more.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.860
I love you more!

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:03.080
But I always liked the name David.
It's so sweet.

01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:07.660
But Micah is a name strong
in the goodness of the Lord.

01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:11.360
When we are gone,
he will carry on our work here.

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.700
He will need such a name.

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:16.500
All right.

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:31.350
Try to forget
what I said to you last night.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.080
It was blasphemy.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.650
I placed my love for you
above my love of God.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.030
I will spend the rest of my life
seeking His forgiveness.

01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:09.360
Micah. Micah.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:11.990
Micah.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:26.140
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.240
I baptize you Martha Iliki Pupali.

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:34.180
And I receive you
as a member of this church.

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.290
The first fruit of my ministry.

01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:59.980
- Is she going to do it?
- Yes, she is.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.310
At first she threatened to cancel
the whole affair

01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:06.540
unless I allowed her to become
a full member of the church.

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:08.880
- Brother John.
- Very fine sermon, Reverend.

01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:10.680
- Thank you, Captain.
- Mrs. Hale.

01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:12.950
When I mentioned Kelolo

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.220
she had the effrontery to swear
she had sent him away.

01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:19.290
Well, she has.
He lives in another house now.

01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:24.400
Yes, he sneaks back into the palace
every night, she admitted it.

01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:30.810
Her desire for grace
is quite overshadowed...

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:35.540
- by her lust for Kelolo.
- Don't call it lust, Abner.

01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:38.450
It must be terribly hard for her to
understand that a form of marriage

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:41.950
she's always considered holy,
is thought by us to be a deadly sin.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.850
- I find it sad.
- Sad?

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.120
Yes, I find it sad
that after all these years together,

01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:53.690
two people should have to stop
loving each other in order to love God.

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:05.100
This day new laws are made
for us of Maui.

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:08.840
Because these laws
are made for two people,

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:12.350
I speak them in our two tongues,

01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:16.280
English first and then Hawaiian.

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:22.490
First law: In this place,
everyone will serve God.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.820
Everyone will love Jesus.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.830
Next law:
There will be no killing of people.

01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:37.340
No grown people, not children,
no sick babies will be killed.

01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:44.840
Next law:
No more will girls go to the ships.

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:51.610
Next law: When the sun
goes down beneath the water,

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.780
the sailors will go back to the ships.

01:25:55.730 --> 01:26:03.130
Next law: No more will the grog shops
sell the rum to my people.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.640
Next law: There will be no more
sleeping together in mischief

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.300
without getting married.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.520
Next law: Here, Kelolo
will be chief of the policemen.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.680
He will beat with sticks
the breakers of these laws.

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:31.390
He will put them in the jailhouse
here in the fort.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.160
Let us now obey these laws.

01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:40.170
Then no more will people laugh at us
how we live in Lahaina.

01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:44.410
The four of us speak for every ship
in Lahaina harbor, ma'am.

01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:46.740
For over two years my men
have been at sea,

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.710
and they will not be bound
by a curfew.

01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:51.810
We bring lots of custom to this place.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.010
It used to be
the best port in the Pacific.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.350
We live in a small place,
but we change with new times.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.450
You will obey my law.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.430
This afternoon our men are coming
ashore. They will remain ashore tonight.

01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:07.260
There'll be no rape,
but any woman willing to trade her favor

01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:09.770
for a yard of calico
will have the opportunity of doing so.

01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:12.730
If you come, you will be arrested.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.030
Try that and there'll be trouble.

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.130
Then there will be trouble.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.420
You no walk this place,
go more far!

01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:42.690
We're coming ashore.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.060
Touch one of my men
and you'll smart for it.

01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:49.540
You get thrown in the jailhouse,
damn lhaole.

01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:52.400
You're harder to see
than the Empress of China.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.670
A man has to fight
every inch of the way.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:28.700
I love you, Jerusha.

01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:31.200
I love you, I love you.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.650
There are a thousand whales
running off Japan, and I...

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:38.440
I left them and I sailed
half an ocean just to...

01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:42.420
Why, he's made
an old woman of you.

01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.320
No, he hasn't.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.930
But he's made a damn good try.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.330
I'm taking you back
to New Hampshire.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:54.830
Can you imagine Walpole
in the autumn,

01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:59.770
with the leaves beginning to turn?
And the first snowfall on its way?

01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:01.100
Oh, don't, don't!

01:30:01.210 --> 01:30:03.200
And the logs on the hearth?

01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:06.330
But who needs a fire
in this godforsaken place?

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.000
And a piano?
Someone singing?

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.050
- And you, Jerusha.
- I'll never see Walpole again.

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:13.740
Yes, you will, you will.

01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:15.550
You'll see it with me.

01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:19.150
Look, I don't give a damn
about my immortal soul.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.520
But I do care about you.

01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:23.860
One minute with you,
one hour, one day with you.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.930
Now, pack your things.

01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:27.190
Wait! No, no...

01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:31.130
Hale walhihe! Hale walhihe!

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.760
Our nice pretty church house!

01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:35.770
I think them sailor men
gonna burn them all up with fire!

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:40.840
Iliki, stay here,
Micah is asleep.

01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:49.970
Church more better now.

01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:54.880
Burn him big holes in wall.
Let plenty air come inside.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.920
My people,

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:08.480
it is good
that you did not let the church die.

01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:12.620
When you sleep, God will smile.

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:26.140
Now, will the sailors
go back to their ships?

01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:58.330
Jerusha, I promise you.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.210
I won't touch you,
I won't even look at you.

01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:03.910
Please,
please come onboard my ship.

01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:07.470
I'll take you and your child
to Honolulu

01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:09.380
and there I'll ship you both to Boston.

01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:12.620
You'll have an even chance
of staying alive there.

01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:18.230
He'll kill you here, Jerusha.

01:34:18.330 --> 01:34:20.060
He will kill you.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.190
Good-bye, Rafer.

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.630
Good-bye, Jerusha.

01:34:43.850 --> 01:34:45.190
- Morris!
- Yes, sir!

01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:47.480
Gather what men we have left
and get them aboard.

01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:50.030
I want my ships
out of this port by sunrise.

01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:51.420
Right away, sir.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.270
- What are you so mad about?
- Damn lhaole. Him no more good.

01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:03.670
Him try burn
the church house with fire.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.850
Steady, steady.

01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:10.170
Easy!

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.540
Now, tell me.

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:16.280
How would you like to see
the lights along Manila Bay?

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.920
Or Singapore?

01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.120
Or the Irrawadi in Rangoon?

01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:28.520
What that?

01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:31.980
Very good, Luku.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.500
I thought so!

01:36:09.010 --> 01:36:10.700
What the devil do you want?

01:36:10.810 --> 01:36:13.970
I've come for the young woman
named Martha Iliki Pupali

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.640
Who is illegally concealed
aboard this vessel.

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.510
Get off my ship!

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:23.020
I will not leave without Iliki.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.280
Why, you bible-thumping
son of a bitch,

01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:28.150
do you want every female
I lay my eyes on?

01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:39.100
Mr. Morris!

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.600
Next time you let the preacher
aboard this ship I'll hang you.

01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:44.470
Maho. Maho!
Shark! Shark!

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.740
- Maho!
- Shark down there!

01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:50.440
Over here, shark!
Go get him!

01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:03.020
He let him get away.

01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:06.060
He was... a big shark, too!

01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:14.860
Well, everything in these latitudes
is a disappointment.

01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:24.770
- Mr. Morris, we weigh anchor.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.010
Prepare to make way!

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.310
Prepare to make way!

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:18.000
Mele, take this mail to Hale, please?  
 Immediately.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.300
8000 hectares Hawaiian Land acquired by FLAUD

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.100
Very Good!

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:54.400
Fraud is spell with an 'R' not an 'L'

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.300
Make the change and Print it!

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
This is for you..

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.700
And one for you too. Thanks.

01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:25.630
If there be no further discussion,

01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:30.330
we shall now vote on that resolution
calling for the expulsion

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.770
of Brother Abraham Hewlett
from his ministry.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.440
Those in favor will let it be known by
raising their right hands and saying aye.

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:39.810
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.650
Those opposed will raise their right hands
and signify by saying nay.

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.730
- Nay.
- Nay.

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:58.630
Three. The "Ayes" have it,
the motion is carried.

01:41:58.730 --> 01:42:00.170
The minutes of these proceedings

01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:03.400
will be sent to the
Board of Commissioners in Boston,

01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:05.940
and the congregations
will be duly circularized.

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:08.470
Abraham Hewlett...

01:42:10.050 --> 01:42:12.140
it is the judgment of this meeting...

01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:14.980
...that your continued presence
in these islands

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.090
is an embarrassment to the church.

01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:21.350
And it is our decision
that you leave here and live elsewhere.

01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:26.830
It is not within your jurisdiction
to advise me any further.

01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:28.830
I shall live where I wish.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:32.290
You will receive
no sustenance from us!

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.430
What sustenance?

01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:38.440
Those yearly barrels of trash
and cast-off junk

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:42.770
sent to us by the Boston Missionary Board
and disguised as Christian charity?

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.510
My wife has brought me
several thousand acres of prime land.

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.710
I shall work for myself,

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.880
earn my own wage,

01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:57.080
and provide for my family here
on these islands for as long as I choose.

01:42:57.190 --> 01:43:01.600
You love Hawaiians as potential converts,
but you despise them as people.

01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:05.690
Having come
to the opposite conclusion,

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:09.670
I gladly depart from a Ministry
in which love has no place.

01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:19.780
We shall now look to that resolution

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.650
censuring Brother John Whipple
for performing the marriage ceremony

01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:27.480
whereby our lost brother fell into sin.

01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:30.620
I'd say the ceremony was one
whereby he fell out of sin.

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:37.230
As for the vote,
save your time, Brothers.

01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:39.530
I also take my departure.

01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:42.630
Brother John!

01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:52.780
Kelolo has something to say to you,
Makua Hale.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.910
Make you very happy.

01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:01.680
I evil, I corrupt, I sinful.

01:44:03.490 --> 01:44:07.020
You see?
Already has he found grace.

01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:11.570
Does this mean you are prepared
to move out of the palace

01:44:11.670 --> 01:44:14.930
and renounce this carnal union
with your sister?

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:18.630
He will not have to go away,
Makua Hale.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.210
He will be a Christian
and I will be a Christian.

01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:28.910
Many times have you said that marriage
between Christians is sanctified.

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:34.110
A marriage between brother and sister
can never be sanctified.

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:40.060
Then there is no way I can keep Kelolo
without going to hell?

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.490
No way at all.

01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:58.010
I am so filled with sin
that in the wrong way do I love Kelolo.

01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:02.510
Yet also do I love Jesus.

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:06.280
He was such a good young man

01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:08.790
with so much aloha,

01:45:08.890 --> 01:45:14.020
and they hurt him so badly
when they killed him.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:20.430
It will be sad when I die
and not go to Him.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:26.870
On the day you send Kelolo away,
I will accept you into the church,

01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:30.970
and you will see Jesus.

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:33.150
I promise.

01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:41.960
Now will I sleep for a while.

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.490
Aloha, Makua Hale.

01:45:44.590 --> 01:45:48.790
Aloha, Alii Nui.

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.530
So King Tamatoa called together
his people in Bora Bora

01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:10.880
and said, "This new god,
this Oro, I do not like him.

01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:15.990
"He is a god of vengeance and wrath.
Let us run away from him.

01:46:16.090 --> 01:46:18.990
"Let us cross the waters
to another land.

01:46:19.090 --> 01:46:22.790
"There, without fear,
can we worship Kane,

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:26.560
giver of life, Kane the gentle."

01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:30.730
So they did that,
and as they drove the canoe forward,

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.740
this was their chant...

01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:52.620
What's this?
What is it, what's going on?

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.720
It's a chant that tells how our people
sailed from Bora Bora

01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:59.430
to this new land
beneath the Seven Little Eyes,

01:46:59.530 --> 01:47:01.500
guided by Mano the shark.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.600
In a way, it's like the migration
of Abraham in the Bible.

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:08.110
Dismiss the class.

01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:12.640
You are dismissed.

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.660
How dare you compare a bundle of myths
to the Holy Scriptures?

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:45.010
These Kahuna superstitions
are dangerous, Keoki.

01:47:45.110 --> 01:47:47.880
Your task is to spread the word
of Almighty God.

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.110
I have waited eight years
to spread it.

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.920
And you have not ordained me yet.

01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:57.250
How long must I wait,
Reverend Hale?

01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.390
I'll answer you truthfully.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:04.930
For the present I have no plans
for ordaining you at all.

01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:10.640
- What do you hold against me?
- My dear Keoki.

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:12.100
You're too young.

01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:14.540
I'm older than you
when you were ordained.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.480
Yes, but you must remember
that I grew up in a Christian family.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.780
- I was...
- A white man?

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.220
If you wish to put it that way, yes.

01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:33.030
For over a hundred years,

01:48:33.130 --> 01:48:37.330
my ancestors fought that this church
might be established.

01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:39.460
Some of them died for it.

01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:42.590
I cannot wait 100 years,
Reverend Hale.

01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:45.500
I was the highest student
in the mission school in America.

01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:48.270
It was me and my words
that brought you here.

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:55.450
That is correct.

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.710
I've been thinking lately

01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:06.590
that our church is ready
for a board of deacons.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.530
I'm willing to make you
their head, Keoki.

01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:12.130
You would move among
the Hawaiians,

01:49:12.230 --> 01:49:15.400
find out who is smoking,
who has alcohol on his breath,

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.840
who is sleeping with another man's wife,
that sort of thing.

01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:23.810
Then each week you will hand me a list
to be admonished from the pulpit.

01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:28.440
I sought a way to serve my people.

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:31.580
Not to spy upon them.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.650
Your mother will not be pleased that
you have refused the deaconship.

01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.290
My mother is dying.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.900
Your mother is not dying, Keoki.

01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:48.900
I just talked with her.
There's nothing wrong with her.

01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:51.370
She will die.

01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:55.200
And then will come
the whistling wind.

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.570
Who's the young boy?

01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:09.540
King Kamehameha.

01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.980
I could find nothing wrong with her.

01:51:15.090 --> 01:51:18.060
But she is dying,
there's no question of that.

01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:20.990
She would like to see you both.

01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:48.820
Hear me,
for I speak to Kelolo.

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:59.390
Dear brother, dear husband,

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.840
God commands you
to be sent away from me.

01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:07.930
Sent away to a faraway place.

01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:12.970
No more shall I sleep in your arms.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:18.780
No more shall you see me again
in the sunlight.

01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:25.590
I have said it.

01:52:27.130 --> 01:52:28.620
Aloha.

01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:45.140
I will need some water.

01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:49.440
There is water beside me,
Makua Hale.

01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:07.800
Malama Kanakoa,

01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:12.430
having entered into a state of grace,

01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:15.840
seeks baptism
into the Holy Church.

01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:22.780
In the name of the Father,

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.680
the Son,

01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:27.980
and the Holy Spirit,

01:53:28.090 --> 01:53:33.550
I baptize you
Ruth Malama Kanakoa.

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:40.100
Of Ruth it is written,

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:45.370
strength and honor
are her clothing,

01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:49.710
and she shall rejoice
in time to come.

01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:58.140
And Ruth said,
"Wither thou goest, I will go."

01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:02.120
Alolha hui.

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:09.460
Alolha hui.

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:14.700
My adorable little lhaole sister.

01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:29.640
Hear me again,
for I make a kapu.

01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:34.450
If on some distant day,
I shall die,

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.550
let no one cut his skin

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.260
or strike out the teeth
from his mouth

01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:46.970
or pluck out the eyes from his face.

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.700
Obey this law.

01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:56.410
Ae.

01:54:59.050 --> 01:55:00.410
Makua Hale?

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.580
Alii Nui.

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.590
I be too Ionely apart from Kelolo.

01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:13.730
Before he goes,
may I not touch him once more in aloha?

02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:32.180
Stop this abomination!

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:35.180
I forbid it! I forbid it!

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.880
Let me go!

02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:39.950
Go!

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.990
You cannot go through
with this, Keoki.

02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:49.150
You must not interfere with us here,
Reverend Hale.

02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:52.320
Your mother will curse you
from her grave!

02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:55.160
She is not in her grave,
Reverend Hale.

02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:59.000
In her last words to our father,
she said, "For their own good,

02:05:59.110 --> 02:06:01.440
"my people must become Christians,

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:04.810
"so let Makua Hale bury me
in the Christian way as an example.

02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:07.900
"Then dig me up
and hide my bones in the old way,

02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:13.390
so that Kane and Kanaloa and Pele
will know that I love them, too."

02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:15.720
You are lying!

02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:19.920
My mother's bones are hidden
where no one will ever find them.

02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:23.090
And her heart goes
with our father to Bora Bora.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.440
Backslider! Heretics!

02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:36.770
Blasphemers!

02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:39.470
Heathens!

02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:21.540
Oh, God! Bring them low!

02:08:21.650 --> 02:08:22.670
Punish them!

02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:28.420
Send earthquakes! Plagues!
Floods! Pestilence!

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:30.010
Destroy them!

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:33.580
Destroy them utterly!

02:09:14.330 --> 02:09:15.490
Well?

02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.300
The child is terribly deformed.

02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:25.880
It is God's punishment.

02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:29.240
- Abner!
- They have defied God.

02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:33.880
And God has visited his wrath
on them, as I foretold.

02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:36.820
Abner, don't you understand?
The baby is in danger!

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.980
They can't accept
a deformed child as Alii Nui.

02:09:39.090 --> 02:09:40.420
They may even try to kill it!

02:09:40.530 --> 02:09:42.760
Now they will see

02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:46.460
how God rebukes
apostasy and incest.

02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:48.400
All of them will see.

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.060
All of them!

02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:51.870
All of them will see!

02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:00.310
Because Noelani and Keoki

02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:05.550
lusted like rutting beasts in the field
before your very eyes,

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.380
because they broke the commandments
of God and the laws of men,

02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:13.360
now has God punished them.

02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:16.020
Take heed before it is too late.

02:10:16.130 --> 02:10:20.970
Take warning, for the deformed offspring
of that evil union

02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:25.970
was ordained by Almighty God
Himself who has said,

02:10:26.070 --> 02:10:30.980
"I will punish the wicked
for their iniquity.

02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:35.400
"Everyone that is found
shall be thrust through.

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.710
"Their houses shall be spoiled,

02:10:38.650 --> 02:10:40.550
"their wives ravished,

02:10:40.650 --> 02:10:45.320
their children also shall be dashed
to pieces before their eyes."

02:11:14.890 --> 02:11:16.360
He won't see you.

02:11:20.430 --> 02:11:21.760
Noelani?

02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:30.930
- If only I'd had a chance to save it.
- You had that chance.

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:33.270
I mean its soul.

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.800
I mean the child.

02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:54.750
I'm carrying too much whale oil to make
a run back to the whaling grounds,

02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:57.390
and not enough for a trip
to New Bedford.

02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:58.790
That happens.

02:12:00.130 --> 02:12:02.530
Make me a fair offer
and the lot is yours.

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:06.630
Since Doc Whipple joined the business
we've stopped buying odd lots of oil.

02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.070
Why?

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:09.700
We'll store it for you,

02:12:09.810 --> 02:12:12.870
and trans-ship it with other odd lots
when we have a full cargo.

02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:17.140
Charge you a fair fee for the service.
But we won't buy anything.

02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:18.680
It's Doc's idea.

02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:21.150
From now on, we don't own,
we just handle.

02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:23.020
Well, I'll be damned.

02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:24.950
You don't put up
a dollar of your own money,

02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:28.220
and yet you handle anything
that passes in and out of the port.

02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:29.800
For a fee, of course.

02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:32.160
An honest burglar
would use a gun.

02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:34.590
Well, for people
who came here to do good,

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:37.690
you fellows have done pretty well,
don't you think?

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:42.330
I believe the Reverend Hewlett in Honolulu
is going in for the sugar cane business.

02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.380
As a matter of fact,
Doc's going there

02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.740
to open a branch
for us to handle it for him.

02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:48.180
You're worst than locusts.

02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:50.940
- When can I move my whale oil?
- In the morning.

02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:52.310
I'm shorthanded as well.

02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:56.150
I need a cook, seven or eight
healthy kanakas at $5 a head.

02:12:56.260 --> 02:12:59.160
We can supply the cook, but we
don't handle native labor anymore.

02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:00.230
Why not?

02:13:00.330 --> 02:13:03.630
The practical reason,
Hawaiians are becoming too scarce

02:13:03.730 --> 02:13:04.960
to ship from these islands.

02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:09.000
The humanitarian reason,
we won't use force to round them up.

02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:11.560
Dr. Whipple?

02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:20.240
Miss Hale want you come see
what make Micah not feel good.

02:13:21.450 --> 02:13:22.940
I'll be right there.

02:13:23.650 --> 02:13:24.670
Excuse me.

02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:30.080
What we make in handling charges,
we lose in free medical services.

02:13:30.190 --> 02:13:32.660
I'll bet.
What about my deckhands?

02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:35.590
Fredericks operates
the press gang on the island.

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.660
If you must have them,
go and see him.

02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.510
Do we have to wear these again?

02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:01.050
David, you know you do.
Your father told you it's October.

02:14:01.150 --> 02:14:03.680
- But they're too hot.
- I know they are.

02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:07.730
- What seems to be the trouble here?
- Hello, John. Thank you for coming.

02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:09.230
I put Micah to bed.

02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:11.320
I'm not worried about Micah.
I'm worried about you.

02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:13.990
I've told you this before,
and I'll repeat it.

02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:16.130
You are working yourself to death.

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.400
- Lucy, run along and play with David.
- Beans again? And salt pork?

02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:22.440
In a place where fruit ripens
the year round,

02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:25.770
- and fish come fresh from the sea?
- Abner doesn't really like it.

02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:28.370
I'll listen to Abner on religion,
but not on diet.

02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.580
You must go home, Jerusha.

02:14:32.690 --> 02:14:36.180
You must go home for at least a year.
Two would be even better.

02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:38.950
Otherwise, you'll die here,
you'll die young.

02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:41.720
If you don't take it up
with Abner this time, I will.

02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:44.190
Oh, no, John,
I will talk to him, I promise.

02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.160
I've delayed this long because...

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:55.000
Well, about Micah. He's got a fever
and his chest is covered with spots...

02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:56.370
Spots?

02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.750
But measles is a child's disease.
I can't understand...

02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:14.120
To us, it is a child's disease, Abner,
but to the Hawaiians,

02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:17.490
who have developed no resistance
at all, it is a deadly pestilence.

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:19.000
The sailor who brought it ashore

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.900
is bound to have infected dozens
of others besides Micah.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.460
Within three days, this disease
will sweep like a raging plague.

02:15:26.410 --> 02:15:28.170
Their fevers will go high,

02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.070
their deaths are agonizing
beyond all imagination.

02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:34.450
Our children will come through
in good shape.

02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:37.210
We can save a fair percentage
of the Hawaiian children

02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:39.440
if we can separate them
from their parents.

02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:42.110
The adults are another story.

02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:46.490
One month from today,
one third of our population will be dead.

02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:50.150
One out of four of the survivors
will develop consumption.

02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:53.820
One out of 7 will be deaf,
one out of 12 will be blind.

02:15:53.930 --> 02:15:55.870
I need all the help you can give me.

02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:58.490
Captain Hoxworth has offered
to organize a harbor blockade.

02:15:58.610 --> 02:16:01.600
The only trouble
is that many of the sailors have come...

02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:03.010
What of Iliki?

02:16:03.110 --> 02:16:05.010
What have you done with her?

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:09.340
I married her off
to an English consul in Santiago.

02:16:09.450 --> 02:16:13.910
With what you and I together
have taught her, she'll end up a duchess.

02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:15.780
Get out of Lahaina!

02:16:15.890 --> 02:16:19.760
He can't get out of Lahaina, Abner,
he's quarantined like the rest of us.

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.000
We accept your offer, Captain.
And we thank you.

02:17:01.469 --> 02:17:02.870
Get your mother home.

02:17:02.969 --> 02:17:06.170
- John, just give me a minute.
- No argument, Jerusha.

02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:08.070
Get her home and keep her there.

02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:38.100
Everybody go beach.
Make lie-down in the water.

02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:39.969
Try for keep cool.

02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:42.940
That'll kill them.
They'll catch pneumonia and die.

02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:46.080
Rafer, help me.

02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:08.100
Good Lord!

02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:11.469
Go back to your homes,
you must not stay here!

02:18:11.570 --> 02:18:13.799
It'll kill you here,
go back to your homes!

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:15.639
Go back to your homes!

02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:18.440
No, no, too hot, burn like fire.
Get cool in water.

02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:31.120
You must come with me, Keoki.
Let me help you.

02:18:31.219 --> 02:18:33.620
- You need warmth, blankets.
- Leave me alone.

02:18:33.730 --> 02:18:36.860
Please, Keoki,
if you stay here, you will die.

02:18:36.959 --> 02:18:38.590
- Then I will die.
- No!

02:18:38.700 --> 02:18:42.129
Go away.
Can't you even let us die in peace?

02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:45.430
You must not die
without salvation, Keoki.

02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:49.700
God will forgive you your sins.
An all-powerful God can forgive anything.

02:18:49.809 --> 02:18:54.410
- God no longer exists.
- Dear brother, don't blaspheme!

02:18:55.350 --> 02:18:57.370
Not "brother," Reverend Hale.

02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.420
Pray with me, Keoki.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:02.920
God, take thy erring servant Keoki
into Thy bosom...

02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:05.580
I will not stay to hear it.

02:19:30.850 --> 02:19:32.440
There's nothing
you could've done for him.

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:38.980
When Captain Cook discovered
these islands 50 years ago,

02:19:39.090 --> 02:19:40.750
they were a true paradise.

02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:43.420
Infectious disease was unknown.

02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:45.090
They didn't even catch cold.

02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:49.060
There were 400,000 of them,
now there are less than 150,000.

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:54.670
You and I may well live to see
the last Hawaiian lowered into his grave.

02:19:55.940 --> 02:19:58.410
With proper Christian services,
of course.

02:20:58.870 --> 02:21:00.030
We...

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:05.810
We seem to have passed
the peak of the epidemic.

02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:15.910
Keoki is dead... of course.

02:21:17.390 --> 02:21:20.480
He went forth unrepentant into hell.

02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:36.160
They're burning... the bodies.
It goes well.

02:21:39.250 --> 02:21:41.370
Aside from that...

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:48.010
there's nothing but the dead,
and the dying, and those who mourn them.

02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:53.110
I did not mean it.

02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:00.490
No matter what I said,
I did not mean it!

02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:03.800
How could I have known
God would scourge them so terribly?

02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:07.430
God had nothing to do with it.
It's a disease.

02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:12.940
The Bible tells us nothing on this Earth
can happen without God's consent...

02:22:13.050 --> 02:22:16.410
Abner, do you believe
every word in the Bible literally?

02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:19.210
Believe?

02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:23.550
The Bible is God's holy word
written exactly as He commanded,

02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:24.820
and I believe it all.

02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:27.950
I believe in heaven and in hell
and in original sin

02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:31.590
and in God's terrible,
all-consuming wrath.

02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.630
If I did not believe,
I could not call myself a Christian.

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:38.070
Then I will no longer
call myself a Christian.

02:22:39.370 --> 02:22:41.670
I don't believe in your God of wrath.

02:22:41.770 --> 02:22:44.500
I don't believe Keoki's in hell, either.

02:22:44.610 --> 02:22:47.670
I believe he has found God,
and Malama with him, and Kelolo,

02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:49.680
and those who died on the beach.

02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:52.650
It's impossible
for the unbaptized to enter heaven!

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:55.820
I've never seen
a people more generous,

02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:59.360
more loving, more filled
with Christian sweetness than these.

02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:01.620
I will not believe
that God rejected them

02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:04.060
simply because
they haven't been baptized.

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.290
Not even that lost child
whose birth you cursed.

02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:20.940
These things
are God's will... not mine.

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:26.980
What else but God's wrath
has the power to annihilate them?

02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:32.820
Disease, despair,
our lack of love,

02:23:33.730 --> 02:23:35.890
our inability to find them beautiful.

02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:42.100
Our contempt for their ways,
our lust for their land, our greed,

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:44.990
our arrogance.

02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:48.400
That is what kills them, Abner.

02:23:50.410 --> 02:23:52.440
That's what you
must save them from.

02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:55.910
They are already lost.
I failed them.

02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:57.610
I failed these people!

02:23:58.790 --> 02:24:00.010
And God.

02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:06.190
My ministry here is at an end.

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:10.060
Your ministry here is not ended.

02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:15.220
You will stay here in Lahaina
and shelter and protect these people.

02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:19.330
You will win them to a merciful God

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:24.140
with bonds of charity so strong,
they will belong to Him forever.

02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:26.980
How?

02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:31.880
By offering what you've always
valued most and found it hardest to give,

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:34.450
to them and to me...

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.060
your love.

02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:08.180
Watch how you handle that!

02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:11.880
I haven't carried this 16,000 miles
to have you drop it.

02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:17.850
That's the lot.

02:25:19.970 --> 02:25:21.900
Hold it in the pier till I get back.

02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:34.480
Hey, you up there!

02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:40.750
Reverend Hale!

02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:47.580
Go into the church, Micah,
and wait for me there.

02:26:09.780 --> 02:26:11.750
I wanna speak with you.

02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:19.550
That's a house.

02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:22.750
I had it built in New Bedford
and taken down piece by piece.

02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:27.390
- But how can this...
- Shut up.

02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:30.260
Every beam,
board and plank is numbered.

02:26:30.370 --> 02:26:33.770
My ship's carpenter will remain here
till it is put together.

02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:38.170
It's for Jerusha.

02:26:40.380 --> 02:26:41.780
For you, too, I guess.

02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:45.610
I want her out of that grass hut,
I wanna put a decent roof over her head.

02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:48.120
But I'm afraid...

02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:51.350
I will not let her spend the rest of her
life in that pigsty you stuck her in.

02:26:52.430 --> 02:26:54.290
Good God, man,
she's your wife!

02:26:54.930 --> 02:26:57.190
Wouldn't you like to see her
living in comfort?

02:26:57.930 --> 02:26:59.260
Of course I would.

02:26:59.370 --> 02:27:00.590
Good.

02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:04.000
Good, then you accept.
The house is on the pier.

02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:06.260
No, I didn't accept, I can't.

02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:10.300
I should've known better
than to speak to you in the first place!

02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:12.570
Where's Jerusha?

02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.080
Well, where is she?

02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:33.230
How did she die?

02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:36.400
I killed her.

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:42.000
I simply killed her.

02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:00.690
That's enough!
Enough!

02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:02.160
Enough!

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:10.930
Go to your father.

02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:13.540
I'll go for help.

02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:18.870
Father!

02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.880
Father!

02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:24.540
Father!

02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:37.720
He's over here,
Reverend Quigley.

02:28:39.370 --> 02:28:44.270
Why, it's Brother Quigley!
Welcome to Lahaina.

02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:46.400
You should have let me know
you were coming.

02:28:46.510 --> 02:28:49.940
It's only for a short visit.
I'm just recently back from Boston.

02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:52.010
Yes, I saw your grandparents, Micah.

02:28:52.110 --> 02:28:54.710
- Who?
- The Bromleys. They send greetings.

02:28:54.810 --> 02:28:57.810
Micah, take Reverend Quigley's
bag along to the house.

02:28:57.920 --> 02:28:58.880
Thank you, Micah.

02:28:58.990 --> 02:29:00.680
Come, we have much to discuss.

02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:02.750
It's lovely back in Walpole.

02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:05.850
I'd forgotten how beautiful
the autumns can be there.

02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:08.290
Did you get back
in time for the Annual Meeting?

02:29:08.390 --> 02:29:12.520
- Yes, we missed you, Brother Hale.
- Well, I was unable to get away.

02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:16.500
We are engaged in a great
struggle with the sugar planters here.

02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:20.730
- Yes, I've heard reports of it.
- Their lust for land grows every day.

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:24.040
I finished helping my Hawaiians
draft a petition to the king

02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:27.540
that no more land be sold
to the planters or any other foreigner.

02:29:27.650 --> 02:29:28.880
- Indeed?
- Yes.

02:29:28.980 --> 02:29:32.850
And also we are assembling regularly
in meetings of public protest.

02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:35.550
- In your church?
- Yes, of course!

02:29:35.660 --> 02:29:38.450
What purer purpose
can our churches be put to

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:41.290
than to protect the Hawaiians' land?

02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:44.090
Their land is their life,
Brother Quigley.

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:45.820
Malama understood that.

02:29:45.930 --> 02:29:49.230
Every church in the kingdom
must stand forth as a bastion

02:29:49.340 --> 02:29:52.400
against those who would rob
these people of their birthright.

02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:56.370
And the walls are two feet thick.

02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:58.810
As you see, of course.

02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:03.410
I left the windows uncovered, though.
It's cooler that way.

02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:05.710
And the wind...

02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:08.250
can blow through.

02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:15.020
Of course, there is no Alii Nui...
left to die.

02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:21.160
They develop
shocking temperatures.

02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:25.130
That's why it's unhealthy for them
to work in the cane fields.

02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:29.540
I've seen as many as 40 Hawaiians
hitched to ploughs.

02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:31.630
Sugar is a curse on these people.

02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:35.510
We reviewed the whole problem
of sugar at the Annual Meeting.

02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:37.410
Came to some conclusions
about it.

02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:39.510
Very good, excellent!
Tell me.

02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:44.820
It is felt the time has come for
our missions to become self-supporting.

02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:48.550
To that end, we voted
to authorize members of our ministry

02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:51.530
to invest in plantation lands
and sugar mills

02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:54.620
and to operate them also,
if they have the skill.

02:30:57.340 --> 02:30:59.030
But we are a family...

02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:01.400
in Christ.

02:31:02.170 --> 02:31:04.040
Dedicated to poverty.

02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:08.880
It has cost us 20 years
of poverty and sickness

02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:13.150
and sometimes death, to win these people
to Christianity and make them literate.

02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:16.780
If we now desire
a competence for our old age,

02:31:16.890 --> 02:31:20.290
a heritage for our children,
we have every right to earn it.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.730
We are taking the land

02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:37.870
of the people whose souls
we came to save

02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:41.750
while they are dying.

02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:45.650
A whole race is dying
before our eyes.

02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:48.450
I'm afraid that is true.

02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:52.550
But the Lord's ways
are not our ways.

02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:54.490
And the only answer that I can find

02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:57.590
is that perhaps the Lord
intends for these islands

02:31:57.700 --> 02:32:00.130
gradually to pass into other hands.

02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:04.460
May God forgive you!

02:32:10.810 --> 02:32:13.240
There is a feeling

02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:17.370
that you've worn yourself out
in God's service, Brother Hale.

02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:19.470
The church wishes to reward your labors

02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:22.080
with something
more substantial than gratitude.

02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:26.690
But l... reward?

02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:29.590
The Board of Commissioners
has appointed you

02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.890
to the pulpit of Regents Church
in New Surrey, Connecticut.

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:37.530
Forgive me, I don't quite...

02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:40.670
A comfortable residence
adjoins the church,

02:32:40.770 --> 02:32:42.600
and the stipend is quite reasonable.

02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:48.710
You are taking my church...
away from me.

02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:52.810
Not at all! You are simply being called
to a better one in New England.

02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:57.050
Brother R.S. Bonham has been transferred
from Kauai to succeed you here.

02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:03.660
You are taking my church...
away from me.

02:33:05.800 --> 02:33:10.130
Passage on the Bigahtihe Eueka
has been arranged for you and your family.

02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:12.700
She sails
Tuesday afternoon for Boston.

02:33:14.470 --> 02:33:15.840
No.

02:33:16.810 --> 02:33:19.070
I'm afraid
the decision is already made.

02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:24.550
The Annual Meeting
commissioned a tablet

02:33:24.650 --> 02:33:27.640
to be placed in this church
commemorating your ministry.

02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:37.460
My ministry here is not ended.

02:33:38.930 --> 02:33:41.990
If I no longer can preach
in my own church,

02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:45.470
I will preach somewhere else.

02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:48.800
In the streets, if necessary.

02:33:48.910 --> 02:33:51.640
But I will preach.

02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:56.810
You understand, of course,
you'll get no sustenance from us.

02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:59.410
Yes, yes,
I would certainly understand that!

02:34:00.490 --> 02:34:03.610
Very well, I'll arrange passage
for three instead of four.

02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:06.210
- Three?
- The children.

02:34:06.330 --> 02:34:09.450
Since the death of Sister Jerusha, they
must have been a heavy burden for you.

02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:15.460
They are good children.
They comfort me.

02:34:15.570 --> 02:34:19.060
The time has come for them to complete
their education in New England.

02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:24.100
Micah, yes.

02:34:24.210 --> 02:34:26.470
He's well prepared for Yale.

02:34:28.050 --> 02:34:30.410
But David and Lucy...

02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:33.490
No, Brother Quigley,
they're too young.

02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:36.780
Their grandparents in Walpole
have offered them a home.

02:34:36.890 --> 02:34:41.520
They'll get proper shelter, food,
education, a chance for happiness.

02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:44.430
With no support here,
what can you offer them?

02:34:45.430 --> 02:34:46.920
What will happen to them?

02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:55.870
I will pray on the matter,

02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:59.870
Brother Quigley.

02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:34.840
May the Lord go with you, Lucy.

02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:36.970
Good-bye, Father.

02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:42.780
May the Lord go with you, David.

02:35:42.890 --> 02:35:44.360
Bye, Father.

02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:55.830
I don't like to leave you, Father.
Please let me stay.

02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:00.930
When you have been
graduated from Yale,

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.370
you will return here
and take over my ministry.

02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:06.630
God help you, son,

02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:08.710
and guide your steps.

02:36:08.810 --> 02:36:11.150
My hopes go with you.

02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:13.850
Your mother's, too.

02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:17.890
You are so like her.

02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:25.830
Go along, go along.

02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:33.570
I wish you would reconsider,
Brother Hale.

02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:38.340
You'll be alone here,
no church, no support...

02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:40.550
no friends.

02:36:41.610 --> 02:36:45.520
In this place,
I have known God...

02:36:46.650 --> 02:36:48.480
Jerusha Bromley,

02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:53.120
and Ruth Malama Kanakoa.

02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:59.690
Beyond that,
a man needs no friends.

02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:05.060
Good-bye, Brother Hale.

02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:28.630
Don't cry, Lucy.

02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:33.160
Don't cry, little girl.

02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:34.050
- Makua Hale?
- Yes? Who are you? What do you want?

02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:35.960
I'm Jonah Kiimalo.

02:38:36.060 --> 02:38:39.900
I've been going to school in Honolulu.
You probably don't remember me.

02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:42.830
No, I don't.

02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:46.060
I've come to ask
if I can be your assistant.

02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:50.770
That's impossible.
I no longer have a church.

02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:51.840
I know.

02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:54.710
You'd better talk
to the new minister when he comes.

02:38:54.810 --> 02:38:56.040
Reverend Bonham.

02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:59.350
But I want to help in your work,
Makua Hale, not his.

02:38:59.890 --> 02:39:00.910
What do you mean?

02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:06.180
I mean that I want to stay with you
and be of service to you.

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:19.760
You... you're...
Oh, you...

02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:22.030
You are...

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:26.370
I remember...
Of course, I do remember!

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:27.970
I remember!

02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:39.650
Do you remember that little child...

02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:02.250
You remember?
