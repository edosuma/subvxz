00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
[tropical birds singing]

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
[children chattering]

00:45.240 --> 00:48.000
[speaking indistinctly]

00:52.160 --> 00:53.760
[Mike]  My dear Baron...

00:53.840 --> 00:55.080
Come on, boys!

00:55.480 --> 00:57.080
[Mike]  ...my dear fellow members...

00:57.160 --> 00:58.000
[ship's horn blows]

00:58.080 --> 00:59.080
[man] Sir.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.840
[Mike]  ...we're now well into
the first leg of our tour.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.160
At ease.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.680
[whistling]

01:05.200 --> 01:07.880
[Mike]  The Duke and I flew out
and joined the yacht in Mombasa.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.040
-[Philip] How do you do?
-Very good, sir.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.400
[Mike]  From there, we departed for Ceylon
via the heavenly Seychelles.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.160
Then through the beautiful Malayan states
and on to New Guinea.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.560
Because the Duke
isn't much one for ceremony,

01:21.640 --> 01:24.600
preferring sport and competition
to dinners and speeches,

01:24.680 --> 01:26.840
everywhere we've gone,
we've had our own small-scale Olympics.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.880
-Heave!
-[Mike] Come on, boys!

01:29.960 --> 01:31.320
[all grunting]

01:33.640 --> 01:35.600
We have a number
of gifted athletes on board:

01:35.680 --> 01:37.400
runners, rowers, footballers.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.680
And we've pipped the locals pretty much
everywhere we've been.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.280
-[drums playing]
-[cheering]

01:45.360 --> 01:49.440
But in New Guinea, I'm afraid,
we really met our match.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.480
Get up!

01:56.080 --> 01:58.480
[Mike]  Thankfully,
there is always cricket...

01:59.560 --> 02:00.680
[Philip] Come on, Aldrich!

02:01.360 --> 02:03.600
-Hooray!
-[Mike]  ...where we can be relied upon

02:03.680 --> 02:04.960
to get our revenge.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.520
Bowled!

02:09.600 --> 02:10.640
-Howzat!
-Yes!

02:10.720 --> 02:14.600
[Mike]  Mainly because cricket as a sport
has never been seen before in New Guinea.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.800
[chuckles]

02:15.880 --> 02:17.880
At night, the adventures continue.

02:19.360 --> 02:23.120
On royal tours in the past,
when the Queen has been present,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.880
the evenings have been polite occasions,
with everyone on best behavior.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.160
[club members cheering]

02:28.240 --> 02:29.840
"Not this time.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.680
Philip, as you all know,
is a work-hard-play-hard man

02:33.760 --> 02:35.760
who would never stand
in the way of a bit of fun.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.480
-[boisterous laughter]
-And in New Guinea, as it turns out,

02:38.560 --> 02:40.840
there's no such thing as infidelity.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.240
[club members cheering
and thumping tables]

02:42.960 --> 02:45.760
Men are expected to indulge.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.640
[tribeswomen singing]

02:47.720 --> 02:48.920
[Baron]  By the end of this tour,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.800
I think we'll be able to make
a qualitative assessment

02:51.880 --> 02:54.760
about where the finest women
in the world come from.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.880
But now, however, I can tell you

02:57.960 --> 03:00.680
the women of New Guinea
are sweeter than those of Ceylon

03:00.760 --> 03:02.680
and right up there
with those of Malaya!

03:02.760 --> 03:04.320
[club members cheering]

03:05.640 --> 03:08.840
I have shared these secrets
with you in good faith.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.120
The contents must, like all disclosures
of the Thursday Club, remain secret.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.760
Ninety percent of the officers
on board are married

03:15.840 --> 03:18.200
and would kill me if they knew
what I was writing!

03:18.280 --> 03:19.640
[raucous cheering]

03:20.520 --> 03:23.320
Strict non-disclosure policies apply.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.320
What happens on tour stays on tour.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.640
But rest assured, I will keep you updated
on our forthcoming adventures.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.560
[club members] Oh!

03:34.160 --> 03:37.840
I sense this will be a momentous
and eventful tour indeed.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.440
Ever your fellow member, Mike!"

03:40.520 --> 03:42.800
[raucous cheering]

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320
[shouting]

05:10.680 --> 05:15.080
We put our trust in our ruling class.

05:15.160 --> 05:19.240
We put this great country in their hands!

05:19.320 --> 05:20.640
And what do they do?

05:21.560 --> 05:24.760
How do they pay back our trust?

05:25.560 --> 05:32.160
By taking us into an illegal war
under false pretenses!

05:32.240 --> 05:36.640
A shameful, dishonest misadventure!

05:36.720 --> 05:38.040
[cheering]

05:38.120 --> 05:39.520
Murderers!

05:39.600 --> 05:42.440
[man] You! What about that?
Bloody disgrace!

05:42.520 --> 05:45.160
Dragging us all into ruin! Bastard!

05:46.760 --> 05:48.760
[Mountbatten]  The invasion
has been a disaster,

05:49.200 --> 05:51.360
the UN General Assembly's up in arms,

05:51.440 --> 05:52.800
as are the Americans.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.080
As a result,
our Prime Minister has had no option

05:56.680 --> 06:00.600
but to declare
an immediate ceasefire and retreat.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.720
Without taking back the Suez Canal.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.880
-Quite.
-So it's all been for nothing?

06:06.480 --> 06:08.040
No, rather worse than nothing.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.160
Economically, the drain on
our currency reserves has been so ruinous

06:13.240 --> 06:15.840
that we now face a run on sterling.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.200
-The energy situation is just as bad.
-[Queen Mother sighs]

06:19.280 --> 06:22.120
Panic buying has been reported
at petrol stations,

06:22.200 --> 06:27.240
and... we expect fuel rationing to become
necessary as we move into winter.

06:28.560 --> 06:33.640
It is no exaggeration to say this has been
the worst week for the country since 1939.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.760
The peace and consensus left
by your dear father has gone...

06:39.960 --> 06:42.560
and our reputation for decency
and integrity

06:42.640 --> 06:44.520
-in matters of foreign policy
-[footsteps approaching]

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
has been shattered.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.680
What is it?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.680
The Duke of Edinburgh
is on the telephone, Your Majesty.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.200
Hm? Goodness, that's a first. [laughs]

06:54.360 --> 06:56.640
-From New Guinea, ma'am.
-Oh.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.640
-Sorry, do excuse me.
-[Mountbatten] Of course.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.680
-Give him my best.
-Say hello.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.480
[clears throat]

07:07.680 --> 07:08.560
Hello?

07:08.640 --> 07:09.600
[Philip]  Hello?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.600
Hello. Hello, Philip.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.760
[line crackling]

07:12.840 --> 07:14.080
Hello? Can you hear me?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.120
Yes, yes, I can hear you.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.720
I can't hear you.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.800
Can you hear me?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.000
Yes. I can hear you.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.320
-Uh... hello?
-[line crackling]

07:27.400 --> 07:28.320
Elizabeth?

07:30.840 --> 07:31.800
Can you hear me?

07:36.680 --> 07:37.560
Philip.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.360
Oh.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.240
[Mike] Ready for you, sir.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.240
[Philip] Damn telephones.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.840
-Bloody things.
-[Mike] This is why I don't bother.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.760
[both laugh]

07:59.840 --> 08:01.360
[man over PA]  Assemble on deck
for the morning address.

08:08.840 --> 08:09.920
[crew chattering]

08:10.000 --> 08:11.080
At ease, gentlemen.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.120
Well, our adventure is only two weeks old,

08:20.200 --> 08:23.240
and it's already taken us
nearly 20,000 miles

08:23.320 --> 08:27.240
as we travel the far corners
of the world...

08:28.600 --> 08:31.160
in an attempt to repair
the reputation of our country,

08:31.240 --> 08:33.640
currently being ruined by politicians.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
[laughing]

08:36.760 --> 08:40.400
I would like to thank each and every one
of you for your professionalism

08:41.200 --> 08:43.440
and discipline.
You have all been brilliant.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.480
All, that is,
except for the football team...

08:45.560 --> 08:48.760
-[laughing]
-whose shoddy, leaky defense

08:48.840 --> 08:51.320
and absence
of a natural left-sided player,

08:51.400 --> 08:54.200
led to that rather humiliating defeat
by the Seamen's Club,

08:54.280 --> 08:56.440
of all bloody people,
at Port Swettenham.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.400
[laughing]

08:59.560 --> 09:02.640
I should also like to say,
if I may, Admiral...

09:03.120 --> 09:03.960
Yes, sir.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.960
It's been wonderful for me,
on a personal level, to be back at sea.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.240
The Royal Navy has always occupied
a very special place in my life

09:16.320 --> 09:18.880
and, indeed, in my heart.

09:21.680 --> 09:26.000
There are few greater pleasures in life
than serving on a ship such as this.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.960
That's why it's also very difficult
to leave,

09:29.040 --> 09:33.520
but leave I must and fly to Melbourne
to open the Olympics there,

09:33.600 --> 09:36.080
where I must generally behave myself,

09:36.160 --> 09:38.680
-shake a few hands, cut a few ribbons.
-[laughing]

09:38.760 --> 09:41.960
It will be hell, I can assure you.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.560
And I will be counting the minutes
until you come and pick me up again

09:45.640 --> 09:47.520
and we can continue our great adventure.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.400
Now, in the meantime, behave yourselves,

09:50.480 --> 09:51.760
keep fit...

09:52.800 --> 09:54.560
and don't drink all the bloody beer.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.640
[laughing]

09:59.000 --> 10:00.200
[man] Well said, sir.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.000
[Philip] Well done, boys.
Well done, big man.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.680
Good stuff. Thank you very much.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.280
Well done. Well done. Well done.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.600
[speaking indistinctly]

10:08.680 --> 10:10.200
[laughing]

10:14.800 --> 10:17.000
[Philip] It's so depressing,
this Suez business.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.480
Well, don't read about it then.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.720
I can't help myself.
What were they thinking?

10:22.320 --> 10:25.120
-Shall we look at this schedule?
-[Philip] Will that cheer me up?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.840
Probably not, no.

10:26.920 --> 10:30.440
I've been stripping things out wherever
I can, but it's still pretty hectic.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.760
We start with a uranium mine visit
in the Northern Territory.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.120
-Yippee.
-Agricultural parades in Sydney,

10:36.200 --> 10:39.520
then over to a British Empire
Service League conference in Canberra.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.960
And finally garden parties
at Government House.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.080
-[Philip] Joy.
-But...

10:43.160 --> 10:46.560
I've come up with a stock speech
which you can memorize like a mynah bird

10:46.640 --> 10:48.320
and deliver each step of the way.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.440
[Philip]  Australia.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.680
The name itself conjures up
such romantic images

10:55.760 --> 10:58.240
of progress, ambition and possibility.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.720
It is said that the mark
of any great nation is the journey

11:06.800 --> 11:09.640
-it has endured on its path to glory.
-[laughing]

11:12.880 --> 11:14.760
And what a journey Australia has taken.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.360
[Philip] Oh, I see. So that's the smelter.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.800
From those early European explorers
who landed at your shores,

11:24.880 --> 11:26.880
you've endured
great hardship and crisis.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.800
Less independently-minded nations
would've faltered,

11:29.880 --> 11:31.600
sought support from the parent nation...

11:32.640 --> 11:34.800
once so integral to their governance.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.960
But Australia forged onwards.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.360
[cattle lowing]

11:39.440 --> 11:44.000
Like its rugged and, at times,
unforgiving landscape,

11:44.800 --> 11:48.400
Australia showed true strength,
true mettle.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.080
You have admirably

11:54.160 --> 11:57.680
developed every branch of your life
and culture...

12:00.200 --> 12:06.120
and in just 200 years, have grown
into a unique and individual civilization,

12:06.200 --> 12:09.760
which, I am sure, will rank among
the greatest that the world has seen.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.920
[crowd applauding]

12:16.320 --> 12:17.720
Australia!

12:17.800 --> 12:20.600
-Excellent speech.
-Good man.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.440
Her name's Helen King.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.760
Twenty-nine years old,
writes for  The Age,

12:24.840 --> 12:26.840
one of the most prominent
newspapers here.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.640
She's asked to meet you.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.640
Let's meet her.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.400
What for?

12:32.720 --> 12:33.600
An interview.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.080
Oh, I thought we'd decided no interviews.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.320
We did, but in her case, I find myself
moved to make an exception.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.160
-You saw the way she was looking at me?
-Yes.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.160
You don't think I'm being delusional?
Gentleman's radar and all that.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.360
No.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.080
Not to mention the way she's followed us
every step of the tour. No...

12:51.160 --> 12:54.840
I think we can safely assume
this one's a friend, not an enemy.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.840
[laughs]

13:01.640 --> 13:03.200
[cheering and applause on television]

13:03.600 --> 13:06.080
[man on television]  The car
carrying His Royal Highness,

13:06.160 --> 13:07.240
the Duke of Edinburgh,

13:07.320 --> 13:09.600
makes its way out
onto the splendid red track

13:09.680 --> 13:12.560
here on this pleasant afternoon
in Melbourne.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.160
The crowds are ecstatic as they
get their first glimpse of the Duke,

13:17.480 --> 13:20.840
who is reported to be greatly enjoying
his time here in Australia.

13:22.040 --> 13:27.000
And now we're nearly there as the Duke
takes his place in the Royal Box.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.000
[applause on television]

13:30.040 --> 13:33.600
I declare open the Olympic Games
of Melbourne...

13:34.840 --> 13:38.800
celebrating the 16th Olympiad
of the modern era.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.840
[crowd cheering]

13:44.800 --> 13:46.360
[Queen Mother] He looks happy.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.280
For once.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.840
[man on television]  The Duke smiles
as thunderous applause

13:51.920 --> 13:53.880
and thousands of cheers...

13:53.960 --> 13:56.320
-Yes. Very happy.
-...from the excited spectators

13:56.400 --> 13:58.120
reverberates around the crowded stadium.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.600
You can thank me for that.
It was my idea.

14:00.680 --> 14:04.360
I always knew it was a good idea
to let him shine. Alone.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.000
What a magnificent moment.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.400
Yes, thank you, Mommy.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.480
In ancient Greece,
the beginning of the Games

14:17.560 --> 14:20.360
was heralded
by the homing of the pigeons,

14:20.440 --> 14:21.640
and so too today.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.600
Ready?

14:35.680 --> 14:36.880
-[Julie] Yes.
-[Michael] Yes.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.880
-[secretary] Mrs. Parker. This way.
-Yes.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.840
Wait here.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.960
[man] Mrs. Parker. How can I help?

14:47.280 --> 14:50.920
I'd like to separate from my husband.
Better still, divorce.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.600
Do you mind me asking, on what grounds?

14:54.920 --> 14:56.200
The fact I never see him.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.360
Absence isn't a legal ground for divorce.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
Neglect?

15:03.600 --> 15:06.880
Nor that, I'm afraid. You're going to need
one of the big three:

15:06.960 --> 15:09.680
Adultery, unreasonable behavior
or insanity.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
I'm quite sure there has been adultery.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.320
We will need evidence.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.640
That won't be easy.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.400
Because of his job.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.880
-Mike works for the Duke of Edinburgh.
-In what capacity?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.200
His private secretary.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.160
Oh, I see.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.040
He's also his closest friend.
They're virtually inseparable.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.040
Are you really sure about this?

15:35.600 --> 15:39.120
A divorce can leave a woman
quite isolated.

15:39.720 --> 15:44.000
Maybe things will get better
if you stick it out.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.760
I tend to think that's always
the best way for everyone.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.840
Grass is rarely greener.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.400
I will come back when I have evidence.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.880
[door opens]

16:08.240 --> 16:10.000
-[Evans]  You're taking pethidine?
-[Eden]  Yes.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.360
-[Evans] And the pentobarbitone?
-Yes, I'm taking the pentobarbitone,

16:13.440 --> 16:14.800
but it doesn't work.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.840
I need something stronger.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.080
There is nothing stronger.

16:21.840 --> 16:25.480
The fact is, in terms of pharmacology,
we've gone as far as we can.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.400
[Elizabeth]  I have the greatest sympathy
for your condition, Prime Minister.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.520
And I fully understand
the need for rest...

16:41.320 --> 16:44.240
but given the challenges
that are now facing this country,

16:44.840 --> 16:47.040
you don't feel
that you have a responsibility

16:47.120 --> 16:49.480
to execute your duties
just a little longer?

16:49.560 --> 16:53.480
I asked the physician the same question,
ma'am, but he insisted.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.640
He felt that I was at the very limit
of human endurance.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.800
But the country will be in safe hands.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.920
Mr. Butler will take charge in my absence.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.160
Mr. Head will oversee the withdrawal
of our troops from Egypt,

17:15.240 --> 17:20.920
and Mr. Macmillan will oversee
the... economic situation.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.040
Economic crisis.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.319
How long do you imagine you'll be away?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.680
Not long, ma'am.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.040
A few weeks.

17:31.520 --> 17:36.160
Well, I suppose one can always
reach you at short notice.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.880
It's a point I always make
to my private secretaries.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.480
Yes, I'm away, but Windsor
really is just round the corner.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.240
And Norfolk, too.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.920
County Durham, isn't it?

17:49.640 --> 17:50.920
Your family home.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.560
Jamaica, ma'am.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.560
Your family home?

17:57.320 --> 17:59.320
Where the doctor felt I should be going.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.480
He specified Jamaica?

18:01.560 --> 18:04.440
He specified sunshine, tropical sunshine.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.440
He said he felt
my life might depend on it.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.040
What would he prescribe
for the rest of us... do you imagine?

18:18.960 --> 18:19.960
Prime Minister.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.200
Your Majesty.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.960
[bell rings]

18:27.040 --> 18:28.360
[door opens]

18:35.440 --> 18:36.280
[door closes]

18:43.160 --> 18:45.560
[chattering]

18:54.680 --> 18:56.960
[Eileen] Excuse me! Excuse me!

18:57.520 --> 18:59.800
You work in there, don't you?

18:59.880 --> 19:03.000
At the Thursday Club as a waitress?

19:03.080 --> 19:04.960
-Who's asking?
-My name is Eileen.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.160
Do you have a minute?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.600
Uh, what can I do for you?

19:09.720 --> 19:14.120
I'd like you to tell me
what goes on... inside.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.120
-Are you a reporter or something?
-No, no, nothing like that.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.600
Just a wife of one of the members
and mother to his children.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.680
You may know him, his name is Mike.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.440
There are so many gentlemen.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.680
Mike Parker.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.360
You do know him, don't you?

19:33.240 --> 19:37.080
Mike would've made sure of that.
You're just his type.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.960
Look, one day you will be married too,

19:40.040 --> 19:42.480
and I sincerely hope
that you make a good choice.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.920
But if you don't and you meet a man
who makes you unhappy,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.760
then, as a woman, I would wish for you

19:48.840 --> 19:53.120
to be able to leave that man
easily, painlessly.

19:53.680 --> 19:57.680
So if there is anything you can tell me
that might make my leaving easier...

19:57.760 --> 20:01.480
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker,
but I know nothing of your husband.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.160
-Here is my address and telephone number.
-Excuse me. Coming through here.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.640
[Eileen] Just...

20:10.600 --> 20:12.640
If anything should occur to you.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.200
[sighs]

20:24.360 --> 20:26.920
[chattering]

20:27.000 --> 20:29.280
-We need two more martinis.
-All right.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.520
[man laughing]

20:37.720 --> 20:39.680
[man] Lily! Lily! Lily!

20:40.680 --> 20:42.200
[telephone ringing]

20:45.160 --> 20:46.080
[knocks on door]

20:46.400 --> 20:48.720
-Martin.
-Do you have a minute, Michael?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.440
I think it's important.

20:50.840 --> 20:51.680
Come in.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.360
I'm going to ask you
to go through it again.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.840
Yes. The provenance
of this rumor is quite arcane.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.680
-Your sister...
-Sister-in-law.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.080
...had lunch with her aunt,
who had just spent the weekend at...

21:08.160 --> 21:09.320
Cholmondeley Castle.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.240
At which, one of the other guests
was the bridge partner...

21:13.320 --> 21:14.160
Tennis.

21:15.920 --> 21:20.240
...of the solicitor visited
by Eileen Parker.

21:20.760 --> 21:21.920
I think that's it.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.960
That's half Britain already.

21:25.560 --> 21:31.680
And all of these people now know
Mrs. Parker... is seeking a divorce?

21:31.760 --> 21:33.400
-[secretaries chattering]
-Yes.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.640
That's unfortunate.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.960
It'll be hard to contain.

21:40.280 --> 21:44.200
And what are Mrs. Parker's...

21:45.840 --> 21:46.760
grievances?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.600
Neglect, unreasonable behavior...

21:51.480 --> 21:53.840
and... infidelity.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.440
Just a wife's suspicions,
nothing concrete,

21:57.520 --> 22:00.000
but I believe specific mention
was made of a lunch club

22:00.080 --> 22:03.000
where Lieutenant Commander Parker
and the Duke of Edinburgh are--

22:03.080 --> 22:05.320
Don't tell me. Frequent guests.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.600
Actually, founder members.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.800
Keep an eye on this for me, would you?

22:13.640 --> 22:14.520
A close eye.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.320
-[secretary 1] Three carbon copies.
-[secretary 2] Will do.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.200
[secretary 1] Thank you.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.600
-Here we go.
-Madam.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.480
-Mind your step.
-Thank you very much.

22:46.000 --> 22:46.840
[knock on door]

22:48.280 --> 22:49.720
-Ready, sir?
-[Philip] Certainly am.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.120
His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Edinburgh.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.880
-Thank you for seeing me, sir.
-Not at all.

22:57.720 --> 23:02.800
Well, um, just bear with me
while I put my things down and set up.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.280
-Please.
-Thank you.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.520
-I'm just going to put a microphone here.
-Can I help?

23:17.440 --> 23:18.800
No, it's fine, thank you.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.040
[buttons clicking]

23:22.800 --> 23:24.680
Right, I think that's it.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.480
Right, well, I'll, uh...
I'll leave you two to it, then.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.120
Thank you, Michael. Please.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.080
[Helen] Thank you.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.000
Ah. Ready when you are.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.040
Well, we can't really start
without passing comment

23:40.120 --> 23:43.160
on the situation in Egypt
and the international response.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.720
Why?

23:46.120 --> 23:48.560
Huge demonstrations
on the streets of London,

23:49.040 --> 23:52.440
Eden caving in to international pressure
and calling a ceasefire.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.440
You don't think it's a significant moment
for your country?

23:55.520 --> 23:57.800
Perhaps, but I'm not going to
pass comment on that.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.920
-Why not?
-It's not my job.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.440
It's not what members
of the royal family do.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.640
You must have thoughts about it.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.560
Of course, I'm not a vegetable, but...

24:07.640 --> 24:10.880
my thoughts on issues like that
remain a private matter.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.640
One can't help wondering where it leaves

24:15.720 --> 24:18.800
-Britain's place in the world.
-Well, I'm sure Britain will be fine.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.360
The view from over here is that
Britain has been publicly humiliated.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.400
Oh.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.880
As someone
with surprisingly progressive views,

24:27.440 --> 24:28.640
that must concern you.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.680
I have progressive views?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.360
You don't think that you do?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.880
Televising the coronation?

24:34.960 --> 24:36.440
Advocating modernization?

24:36.520 --> 24:37.760
That's just common sense.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.600
If you're a progressive,
one prepared to make changes.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.640
Well, let's just say
that I learned very early on

24:42.720 --> 24:45.280
that it's wise not
to take things for granted.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.880
You're referring to your family.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.480
How they had to leave Greece
in the revolution.

24:50.960 --> 24:54.640
Your grandfather was shot,
your father fled to avoid being shot.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.480
[clears throat] Yes. Correct.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.600
Well, you see, there's so much
that people don't really know about you.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.160
I can assure you
it's all been rather embellished.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.160
-The truth is really quite dull.
-Dull?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.640
How you personally fled Corfu
in an orange crate?

25:15.160 --> 25:17.560
And then a childhood in exile,
always on the move.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.040
"Exile" is too strong a word,
too emotional.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.440
It's just how it was for everyone.
You just got on with it.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.560
But it can't have been easy.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.240
Was the trauma of being in exile
what brought on your mother's illness,

25:33.320 --> 25:34.160
do you think?

25:38.720 --> 25:39.560
What illness?

25:40.920 --> 25:44.680
Well, the information I have
is that she suffered a breakdown.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.240
Things weren't easy for her.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.400
But she got on with it.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.640
But she was taken away, wasn't she?
To an institution.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.200
Then your father promptly abandoned
the family, ran off with his mistress?

26:03.280 --> 26:06.080
I don't know what you've been reading
or who you've been speaking to,

26:06.160 --> 26:08.800
but both my mother and my father
played very active roles

26:08.880 --> 26:10.200
in all their children's lives.

26:10.280 --> 26:13.600
It isn't true you didn't see your father
for the last six years of his life?

26:13.680 --> 26:15.880
If we're to remain friends,
we really should move on.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.520
All right.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.960
May I ask you about your education?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.160
Sir.

26:29.920 --> 26:30.960
Sir.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.680
-What about it?
-That was pretty unusual, too.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.280
I went to boarding school in Britain.
I don't see what's unusual about that.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.760
For a while, but then you were
taken out and sent to school in Germany.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.440
Because my sisters lived there.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.280
-Your Nazi sisters.
-Oh, Christ.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.240
One of whom was married
to a close personal friend of Hitler's.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.400
I was at school in Germany
for less than a year

26:50.480 --> 26:52.320
before I returned to the United Kingdom.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.960
What point are you trying to make here?

26:54.040 --> 26:55.880
I think it's pretty clear
which side I was on.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.880
My record in the war speaks for itself.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.320
I'm simply saying your background

26:59.400 --> 27:02.240
is so much more interesting and complex
than people might imagine.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.080
-Do they imagine anything?
-I think people are curious.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.720
Here is this striking, handsome man,

27:10.280 --> 27:12.880
walking beside the most famous woman
in the world.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.040
Who is he?

27:17.320 --> 27:19.080
Well, I hate to disappoint...

27:21.600 --> 27:24.280
but he really is just a normal man

27:24.360 --> 27:28.160
in what, from the outside,
probably looks like rather a strange life,

27:28.240 --> 27:33.000
but from the inside,
really is no different to anyone else's.

27:35.160 --> 27:38.040
I don't think there's anything about you
that's like anyone else.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.240
From a young age,
you were effectively orphaned,

27:42.320 --> 27:45.920
your favorite sister, Cecile,
also a Nazi, died in a plane crash--

27:46.000 --> 27:47.480
I really think we should move on now.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.640
What kind of impact does that have
on a man?

27:50.280 --> 27:53.280
That's the kind of trauma
that will doubtless have a bearing on how

27:53.360 --> 27:56.320
your own children and the future
King of England are brought up.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.720
That's enough.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.360
I think people have a right
to know about their leaders, don't you?

28:04.440 --> 28:08.120
Especially ones that can't be thrown out
with free and fair elections.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.040
Don't ever let my vanity
get the better of me again.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.280
[thunder rumbling]

28:33.800 --> 28:35.040
[glass shatters]

28:36.640 --> 28:37.480
[Philip] Christ!

28:38.840 --> 28:40.760
-Christ!
-[glass shatters]

29:11.040 --> 29:13.160
[telephone ringing]

29:17.760 --> 29:19.640
Kensington 8953. Hello?

29:24.600 --> 29:25.440
We met...

29:28.240 --> 29:29.240
a few times...

29:31.120 --> 29:34.120
in... various locations.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.200
Afterwards, he'd... tell me about his job.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.680
The company he keeps.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.240
He didn't mention a wife.

29:51.880 --> 29:52.760
Or children.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.680
I'm so sorry.

30:01.480 --> 30:05.520
If you are really sorry
and want to make my life easier...

30:08.360 --> 30:09.280
Of course.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.680
We will need you
to make an official statement

30:13.760 --> 30:15.640
and give evidence in court.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.760
I can't do that.
I would lose my job, my reputation.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.480
-I'm afraid that's what the law requires.
-No!

30:24.040 --> 30:24.880
No.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.600
So you telephoned me and agreed
to come here today for what, precisely?

30:30.280 --> 30:32.360
To put color into my nightmares?

30:33.160 --> 30:34.000
I'm sorry.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.400
[Charteris]  My sources now tell me

30:42.480 --> 30:44.480
Mrs. Parker has gone
as far as bringing a waitress

30:44.560 --> 30:47.360
from the Thursday Lunch Club
to see her divorce lawyer.

30:47.440 --> 30:51.280
I gather the waitress has not provided
hard evidence on this occasion,

30:51.920 --> 30:53.240
just hearsay.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.000
Though we're obviously getting close.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.760
This cannot be allowed to go
one single step further, Martin.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.680
No.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.520
If Mrs. Parker succeeds
in getting her divorce,

31:02.600 --> 31:06.560
the newspapers would make
the not unreasonable assumption

31:06.640 --> 31:10.440
that anything that
Lieutenant Commander Parker has done,

31:10.520 --> 31:12.600
the Duke of Edinburgh has done, too.

31:12.680 --> 31:18.240
We do not want words like "infidelity"
and "divorce" swirling around.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.280
No.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.160
Whether there is any truth
in the allegations or not,

31:22.240 --> 31:24.720
it would shatter the integrity
of the royal marriage...

31:25.720 --> 31:27.560
and jeopardize the entire monarchy.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.480
Any ideas?

31:34.040 --> 31:35.360
[Philip]  Stand easy. Stand easy.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.680
Right, our grown-up duties are done.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.600
The Olympics are officially up
and running, which means, gentlemen,

31:40.680 --> 31:45.040
we can now get on with the important
business at hand: our tour!

31:45.120 --> 31:46.400
[cheering]

31:48.880 --> 31:51.240
We have nine weeks
between now and our arrival home.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.600
In that time, we will be visiting
the remotest parts of the Commonwealth,

31:54.800 --> 31:57.840
but I'm delighted to say
that during that time,

31:57.920 --> 31:59.680
we will be without reporters.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.280
[cheering]

32:01.360 --> 32:04.080
We will be without photographers.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.360
We will be out of the world's eye!

32:08.560 --> 32:10.640
And with that in mind,
Michael's got a suggestion.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.200
Thank you. Right, gentlemen.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.920
Uh, yes, I'd like to propose
something a little unusual,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.280
something I'm fairly sure none of us
has ever participated in before:

32:19.360 --> 32:23.400
-a beard-growing competition!
-[cheering]

32:23.480 --> 32:28.040
Now, special dispensation has been given
to the dozen or so men

32:28.120 --> 32:31.760
who already have beards to shave them off
and they'll act as judges

32:31.840 --> 32:33.680
for the rest of our efforts, all right?

32:33.760 --> 32:34.640
Yes!

32:35.600 --> 32:36.840
-Hip, hip!
-[crew] Hooray!

32:37.400 --> 32:39.080
-Hip, hip!
-[crew] Hooray!

32:39.160 --> 32:42.040
-Hip, hip! Hooray!
-[crew] Hooray!

32:53.520 --> 32:55.360
[man] It's nothing you've not seen before.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.320
We can't see it now, Bill.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.400
[laughing]

33:18.560 --> 33:20.520
[knock on door]

33:22.320 --> 33:24.960
Right, in their infinite wisdom,
the powers that be have decided

33:25.040 --> 33:27.440
they would like you to make
a Christmas speech.

33:27.520 --> 33:30.400
What? To who? The men on board?

33:30.480 --> 33:31.760
Uh, no.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.320
To the half a billion people that make up
the Commonwealth of Nations.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.800
From the Lord Chamberlain's office.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.520
They'd like you to make a companion
Christmas speech to the Queen's.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.800
A thousand words, preferably uplifting
in tone and Christian in sentiment.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.440
With as many references as possible

33:45.520 --> 33:48.680
to the importance of family
and the sanctity of marriage.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.880
What if I don't want to?

33:51.920 --> 33:54.080
I'm afraid no provisions
appear to have been made

33:54.160 --> 33:57.280
for your having an opinion about that
or, indeed, anything else.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.280
[Adeane]  Because of seniority,

34:00.360 --> 34:04.360
your speech will come second,
the usual time, three p.m.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.880
However, on Christmas morning,

34:07.960 --> 34:10.320
the Duke of Edinburgh is expected
to be in Graham Land,

34:10.400 --> 34:13.600
which is in the Antarctic Peninsula,
which is ten hours behind us,

34:13.679 --> 34:16.920
so he'll have to get up
at the crack of dawn to make his speech.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.520
May I ask why he's making a speech?

34:20.320 --> 34:21.440
Ma'am?

34:21.719 --> 34:23.080
Well, it's not usual, is it?

34:24.280 --> 34:27.040
No, it is extraordinary.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.760
Um, I think the feeling was

34:29.840 --> 34:32.520
that with Your Majesty
and His Royal Highness

34:32.600 --> 34:36.639
having not been seen
in public together for so long,

34:36.719 --> 34:39.159
being, at least, heard together--

34:39.239 --> 34:42.120
No, I see. It might reassure people
that all is still well.

34:42.200 --> 34:45.600
-[chuckles] I wouldn't go that far, ma'am.
-Well, I would.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.600
And I think it's a good idea.

34:48.680 --> 34:49.520
Thank you, Michael.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.360
May I just ask...

34:57.880 --> 34:59.440
just out of curiosity...

35:00.720 --> 35:05.320
what's the longest amount of time that you
and Lady Adeane have been separated?

35:05.400 --> 35:06.360
Uh...

35:07.600 --> 35:08.720
Three weeks, I think.

35:09.720 --> 35:14.120
I see. And would you say that you thrive
or suffer from the separation?

35:15.040 --> 35:17.440
Uh, we don't much care for it,
ma'am.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.520
Helen, in particular, believes...

35:21.440 --> 35:23.560
little good comes from
a couple being apart,

35:23.640 --> 35:25.960
that a husband and wife belong together.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.480
Yes, of course.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.040
-Ma'am.
-[Elizabeth clears throat]

36:07.800 --> 36:12.000
[Morse code beeping]

36:19.080 --> 36:20.680
-Brown?
-Yes, sir?

36:22.920 --> 36:25.240
-[Philip] What's up?
-Australian naval patrol boat,

36:25.320 --> 36:27.440
the HMAS Warreen,
has put out a distress call.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.400
They picked up a fishing boat,
out of power, it's drifted for days.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.040
One man left alive,
he nearly drowned trying to fix the hull.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.520
He suffered a broken rib cage,
and his lung may be punctured.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.560
And the Warreen
doesn't have a doctor on board.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.800
-The man is dying.
-Are we the nearest ship?

36:39.880 --> 36:42.040
There's a French freighter
three miles further out.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.640
[Smith] We are the nearest ship.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.840
Set your course.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.960
Bring her about.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.400
[captain] Coming about.

36:49.480 --> 36:50.560
Ninety degrees.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.480
Hoist.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.280
[man] Up, up. He's coming up.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.200
Steady him.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.080
-[beeping]
-[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

37:24.920 --> 37:25.920
[medic] Straps.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.360
At ease.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.640
We fished him out of the water,
floating near his boat.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.280
The rest of his crew must have drowned.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.880
There was no log on board. We don't
know who he is or where he's from.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.320
It doesn't matter who he is
or where he's from.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.640
He was the captain of a ship...
that's all that counts.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.120
-[medic] We'll need a saline drip.
-He's one of us.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.440
[medic] Immediately. Fluids. Now, man.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.480
No, it's out of the question, sir.

37:54.040 --> 37:54.880
Why?

37:54.960 --> 37:57.800
[Smith] We have a strict schedule,
as part of an official tour.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.880
And to take the man back
to wherever he came from

37:59.960 --> 38:02.800
would be to turn back
in entirely the wrong direction.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.280
It'd take days, maybe a whole week,
off our important schedule.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.800
We can make that time up.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.920
The man's fortunate enough
we saved his life.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.680
We'll simply drop him off at the next
destination and that'll be that.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.120
He will be needlessly separated
from his home.

38:16.200 --> 38:20.080
Find himself in a strange country,
with a foreign language,

38:20.160 --> 38:21.320
away from his family.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.080
[Smith] Not my concern.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.280
Another vessel with less important duties
might find time for such...

38:27.080 --> 38:28.400
sentimental charity.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.120
We've done our important duties
and are on the way home.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.960
We're effectively
a glorified pleasure cruiser

38:34.040 --> 38:36.840
with an abundance of fuel
and time to spare.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.640
Sir, my decision as Flag Officer is no.

38:40.720 --> 38:45.080
And my decision
as Admiral of the Fleet is that we do.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.080
[Smith clears throat]

38:51.600 --> 38:56.280
There is only one person
in command of the vessel.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.240
It's the Flag Officer.

39:01.360 --> 39:05.680
If you'd recall your naval training...
you'd remember.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.480
I do recall my naval training,
as it happens.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.160
Manning command posts on destroyers
during the war.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.840
The same war which, I believe,
you spent on shore duty.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.600
I have never abused my privileges,
and I don't intend to start now,

39:18.680 --> 39:20.120
but this is the Royal Yacht.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.080
I am on it representing the Crown,

39:22.160 --> 39:25.520
and I say turn it around
and take this man home.

39:47.920 --> 39:51.240
[Mike]  My dear friends,
after 20 eventful weeks at sea,

39:51.320 --> 39:55.760
visiting five continents
and covering many thousands of miles,

39:56.240 --> 39:59.680
I'm happy to report that we saved
our greatest adventure for last.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.440
As the Royal Yacht Britannia
turned naval rescue

40:04.520 --> 40:07.760
and we fished a shipwrecked mariner
out of the water.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.960
Our brilliant surgeons operated on him,

40:11.040 --> 40:14.640
then we went out of our way to return him
to his home, his family and his people.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.000
[women clamoring]

40:53.560 --> 40:54.840
[Mike]  And what people.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.280
[chattering]

40:57.360 --> 40:58.640
What a family.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.240
What a home.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.640
-[chattering]
-[woman cheering]

41:21.800 --> 41:25.280
[trumpets playing]

41:28.880 --> 41:31.840
[Mike]  Should you Thursday Club members
ever grow tired

41:31.920 --> 41:34.640
of your colorless
and empty lives in London,

41:35.480 --> 41:36.960
I suggest immediate relocation

41:37.040 --> 41:40.240
to the discrete island nations
nestled around Tonga...

41:42.000 --> 41:45.640
surely the closest one can come
to heaven on Earth.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.600
"Never have we received such a welcome,

41:51.240 --> 41:54.280
-or eaten so well.
-[Islanders singing]

41:54.360 --> 41:57.160
Never have I experienced
such a willingness

41:57.240 --> 42:00.600
to set oneself free and enjoy.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.440
[club members cheering]

42:02.520 --> 42:04.440
And nowhere on Earth,

42:04.520 --> 42:09.000
and we have, by this point, traveled
across almost every inch,

42:09.080 --> 42:15.000
have we encountered
such beautiful women."

42:15.080 --> 42:16.360
[club members laughing]

42:21.480 --> 42:23.000
[Philip] Bye!

42:29.760 --> 42:34.160
[Baron]  "These really have been
the most remarkable few days.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.320
And it is with the greatest reluctance,

42:37.400 --> 42:40.880
that after three days here,
we tear ourselves away,

42:41.360 --> 42:47.000
each of us, not a little bit,
but a great deal in love."

42:47.080 --> 42:49.160
[club members cheering]

43:01.000 --> 43:03.080
[Lily] That is your husband's handwriting,
isn't it?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.320
You said you needed evidence.

43:12.680 --> 43:16.800
That's not a royal tour they're on,
it's a five-month stag night.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.520
Whores in every port.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.160
Good luck.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.400
Uh, thank you.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.320
[corgis barking]

44:12.880 --> 44:14.800
-Happy Christmas.
-Happy Christmas, Your Majesty.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.400
-[Queen Mother] Hello. Thank you.
-Oh, thank God.

44:19.880 --> 44:23.000
[chattering]

44:23.800 --> 44:27.240
[chattering]

44:27.320 --> 44:30.680
[sighs] All right, you two.
Good, now...

44:35.160 --> 44:36.360
[Margaret] Thank you.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.280
[Queen Mother gasps]

44:38.800 --> 44:39.880
[Queen Mother] Edward!

44:40.720 --> 44:42.160
Delighted to see you.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.120
[Mike] Written it yet?

44:46.640 --> 44:47.480
No.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.600
I'm waiting for inspiration to strike.

44:53.640 --> 44:58.120
Might I suggest some gung-ho platitudes
about Christmas and the Commonwealth?

44:58.800 --> 45:02.520
That's what they want me to say.
I mean what I want to say.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.600
Right.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.880
Have you got it yet? Home Service.

45:14.960 --> 45:15.920
Nearly there, sir.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.400
[Margaret] Where exactly is Philip?

45:18.920 --> 45:21.680
-Graham Land, last I heard.
-Where's that?

45:26.560 --> 45:29.440
-[Margaret]  Dickie, where's Graham Land?
-[Elizabeth]  Antarctica. Is it?

45:29.960 --> 45:32.560
-Is that north or is that south?
-[Queen Mother] It's north.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.600
-Don't be silly, it's south.
-[Margaret] Does anyone actually know?

45:35.680 --> 45:38.400
Well, yes, because the Arctic is north

45:38.480 --> 45:42.120
and so Antarctica is non-north,
isn't it, Dickie?

45:42.200 --> 45:43.520
What's "non-north"?

45:43.600 --> 45:44.560
[knock on door]

45:44.640 --> 45:45.640
[Philip] Come.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.720
-It's time.
-Good.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.480
-Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses.
-Oh, children.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.880
[man on radio]  Now, a Christmas
announcement from His Royal Highness,

45:54.960 --> 45:56.120
the Duke of Edinburgh.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.360
Good morning.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.000
This is Britannia.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.760
I'm speaking to you from the edge
of the South Pacific.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.840
59 degrees south and 60 degrees west.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.240
You have to turn the globe upside down
to find this place.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.760
Indeed, a few of us aboard the Royal Yacht
feel a little upside-down...

46:15.360 --> 46:16.880
having never been this far from home.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.880
[chuckles]

46:18.960 --> 46:20.280
The remoteness of the location

46:20.360 --> 46:22.800
presents one
with a precious opportunity to think...

46:24.280 --> 46:28.320
about one's own life,
one's own way of living.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.000
We've traveled the world now
and seen all manner of tribes,

46:33.200 --> 46:35.400
societies and cultures.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.120
We've had endless debates about
which places have the best systems

46:39.200 --> 46:42.200
of government or justice
or the most interesting religions.

46:42.720 --> 46:47.160
And we've been amazed, and impressed
by so much of what we have seen.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.960
Naturally, it has led us
to examine our own lives...

46:52.040 --> 46:53.040
and the way we live.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.760
The things we take for granted.

46:56.240 --> 47:00.000
Is that really Philip?
It's not some sort of Philip impersonator?

47:00.680 --> 47:01.520
Why?

47:01.760 --> 47:04.760
He just sounds so odd. So different.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.280
And here I am,
almost 10,000 miles from London...

47:13.080 --> 47:14.880
surrounded by empty water.

47:17.520 --> 47:22.440
It's a fine life on board a ship...
but it can be a solitary one.

47:25.640 --> 47:26.920
We are men together...

47:30.440 --> 47:32.160
but we each stand alone.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.040
[knock on door]

47:52.480 --> 47:55.320
I've been asked to tell you
that they're ready for you.

47:56.760 --> 47:57.600
Right.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.240
Last-minute changes?

48:03.800 --> 48:05.800
-Something like that.
-May I help?

48:06.560 --> 48:08.960
No. Thank you.

48:13.560 --> 48:14.880
[man 1] Signal strength's good.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.840
-[equipment clicks]
-[man 2] Far be it from me to...

48:17.920 --> 48:19.960
Let's see if I can oil the wheels.

48:20.760 --> 48:22.600
[man 2] All clear from Broadcasting House.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.640
[man 2 speaking indistinctly]

48:27.720 --> 48:29.120
We are ready for you, ma'am.

48:30.960 --> 48:31.800
Yes.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.120
Happy Christmas.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.680
-Happy Christmas, Your Majesty.
-Happy Christmas, ma'am.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.280
[tunes radio]

48:44.360 --> 48:47.440
[man on radio]  People of Britain and the
Commonwealth will now listen to the voice

48:47.520 --> 48:49.680
of Her Majesty the Queen.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.680
Thank you. Ma'am.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.720
[equipment whirs]

48:57.680 --> 48:58.840
Once again,

48:58.920 --> 49:02.920
messages of Christmas greeting
have been exchanged around the world...

49:03.800 --> 49:05.760
carried upon the invisible wings...

49:06.720 --> 49:08.320
of 20th-century science.

49:10.360 --> 49:14.600
And of all those many messages
from all corners of the Commonwealth,

49:15.520 --> 49:17.840
none has given us greater pleasure

49:18.480 --> 49:20.760
than hearing those of my husband...

49:22.360 --> 49:25.880
from the remote
and lonely spaces of Antarctica.

49:28.880 --> 49:30.040
To him, I say...

49:31.400 --> 49:35.520
from all the members of your family
gathered here today...

49:37.200 --> 49:40.880
our very best wishes go to you
on board Britannia.

49:43.400 --> 49:47.920
A very large, united family
is waiting for you here...

49:53.800 --> 49:57.920
and will always be waiting for you,
wherever you are.

50:01.320 --> 50:02.920
-Her Majesty.
-Her Majesty.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.720
[Elizabeth]  I would like
to express my gratitude

50:16.200 --> 50:18.640
to those men and women
of the Commonwealth

50:19.280 --> 50:21.440
whose efforts in our great cities...

51:11.080 --> 51:12.160
[Mike] There you are!

51:15.440 --> 51:16.520
[Philip clears throat]

51:21.760 --> 51:22.840
You all right?

51:24.200 --> 51:25.040
Fine.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.880
Her speech.

51:37.080 --> 51:37.920
What about it?

51:39.520 --> 51:43.400
Touching. Unexpectedly touching.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.360
Caught me off guard.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.560
I might even have to confess
to feeling a little...

51:55.600 --> 51:56.760
Homesick?

52:00.440 --> 52:01.280
Yes.

52:04.280 --> 52:05.120
Right.
