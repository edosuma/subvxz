WEBVTT

00:32.543 --> 00:33.690
Go for it.
Yes

00:40.914 --> 00:42.270
Here we go
Good shot

00:54.582 --> 00:55.625
I like it
Let's go

00:57.151 --> 00:57.985
I have the shot

01:02.494 --> 01:03.537
You will not achieve it

01:04.188 --> 01:05.492
Not bad for an old man

01:07.631 --> 01:09.258
Come on Jeff

01:29.051 --> 01:31.553
You beat me, if I did not have this back pain.

01:32.421 --> 01:34.245
We are going to Tj to have a couple of drinks

01:34.637 --> 01:36.013
I do not go

01:36.300 --> 01:38.749
Two glasses will not do you anything.
Which of the two.

01:41.482 --> 01:43.567
I had a heavy day, I want to go home.

01:46.253 --> 01:49.017
I think we'll leave it for another day.
Yes, I also

01:49.818 --> 01:51.539
What's for lunch?
You pay.

01:52.102 --> 01:54.031
You're kidding
It's fine, good night

01:58.765 --> 02:00.381
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

02:05.657 --> 02:07.795
I'm sorry about your back.
It is torture.

02:09.872 --> 02:10.810
How is Diana?

02:12.855 --> 02:13.792
What happened this time

02:15.362 --> 02:20.158
I do not know, you could not talk to her, she does not know
differentiate a cockroach from the Rolling Stones

02:21.308 --> 02:23.394
I thought you were in the jazz roll

02:23.969 --> 02:25.845
Metaphysically speaking Einstein

02:26.376 --> 02:28.096
What was the problem really

02:29.779 --> 02:31.343
Honestly.
Yes, I do not know

02:33.364 --> 02:34.824
I'm tired of dating

02:36.266 --> 02:38.872
The guys will go to Palm Springs the weekend

02:39.864 --> 02:41.428
They will spend the day of thanksgiving

02:42.650 --> 02:43.537
Leave me alone

02:47.833 --> 02:51.742
I thought about inviting the Bronsons to play tennis.
Do you remember the last time?

02:52.488 --> 02:53.375
No no no no...

02:53.955 --> 02:56.145
Watch me when I speak to you.
Do not yell at me

02:57.007 --> 02:58.415
That's what I call love

03:01.188 --> 03:02.387
Tell me about Palm Springs

03:04.642 --> 03:05.528
Filthy whore

03:09.531 --> 03:10.626
Hey, leave her alone!
Do not mess

03:12.419 --> 03:14.242
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Are you okay?

03:15.608 --> 03:16.651
Lev ntate Miranda

03:20.319 --> 03:21.571
Miranda

03:22.583 --> 03:23.574
It's time to go

03:25.907 --> 03:27.888
She will not go anywhere with you

03:31.789 --> 03:34.083
You do not know who you're getting with a friend

03:35.029 --> 03:36.071
We are scared

03:37.554 --> 03:38.805
It would be better to leave

03:47.736 --> 03:48.674
We will leave now

03:50.619 --> 03:51.506
Jeff, let's go!

03:56.958 --> 03:58.710
Let's go
DO NOT

04:01.629 --> 04:04.445
You should think about the consequences.
Leave me alone

04:04.821 --> 04:06.802
You already heard her, she does not want to leave with you

04:09.269 --> 04:10.771
Let's see

04:18.507 --> 04:19.863
I prophesy my brother

04:21.862 --> 04:24.311
That you're going to regret this all your life

04:34.959 --> 04:36.886
Are you okay? he's gone,
everything is over

04:46.202 --> 04:47.328
Thank you

04:49.754 --> 04:50.848
Are they well?

04:52.519 --> 04:54.761
Yes, it was only the skin.
Let me put this on you

04:59.870 --> 05:01.246
It's fine

05:07.083 --> 05:08.178
Who was that guy?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.328
We have a car, do you want us to take you home?
Do not

05:18.439 --> 05:19.639
I'll take care of her

05:57.220 --> 05:59.878
You would care to tell me what it was all about

06:00.434 --> 06:01.893
I prefer not to talk about it

06:05.658 --> 06:06.492
I'm Miranda Reed

06:08.199 --> 06:09.700
Jeff Mills

06:12.717 --> 06:14.906
You do not think you should tell me where you live

06:17.778 --> 06:19.186
Do you want to go home?

06:23.560 --> 06:25.332
I do not have a house anymore, I lived with Otis

06:27.535 --> 06:28.890
With the type of the park?

06:30.126 --> 06:31.377
It's not always so bad

06:35.729 --> 06:36.824
Sometimes it's worse

06:37.983 --> 06:39.859
Already I imagine it

06:48.990 --> 06:50.502
You could take me to a Motel

06:51.986 --> 06:54.958
Look, it's too late, you're sure that
you want to be alone

07:04.876 --> 07:06.909
You can stay at my house ... if you want

07:09.600 --> 07:11.163
Seriously, I'll sleep in the chair

07:26.215 --> 07:27.414
Hi boy, how are you?

07:29.359 --> 07:30.767
This is Goliath
Hello Goliat

07:31.725 --> 07:33.601
That's Davie, excuse the mess

07:40.372 --> 07:43.187
They're upset because I'm late home
Are they?

07:45.177 --> 07:48.408
It looks in his eyes, you might realize
if you pay attention

07:55.099 --> 07:56.851
Tom Scott?
Yes

07:59.103 --> 08:03.326
Can I offer you something? orange juice, beer
something to eat, ice cream. - No thanks

08:06.648 --> 08:09.202
Is it a palenza? - Yes, do you like it?
It's interesting

08:18.196 --> 08:20.230
Oh ... Brian Donelly
I have it years ago

08:22.154 --> 08:24.188
It was the first piece of art that I bought

08:38.451 --> 08:40.275
How do you know so much about L.A. artists?

08:41.135 --> 08:43.898
I grew up here and I always wanted to paint
   Signs?

08:45.192 --> 08:49.154
Well that's what I try ... actually I have some
paintings on the art walk

08:50.587 --> 08:52.203
Really? I'm impressed

09:22.281 --> 09:23.783
You are only

09:25.117 --> 09:26.525
No brothers, no sisters

09:29.191 --> 09:30.182
Your parents died

09:34.077 --> 09:36.215
A traffic accident, you have a scar

09:39.113 --> 09:40.416
They died six years ago

09:47.228 --> 09:49.678
You have to see something with the law,  polic a? ... no

09:52.604 --> 09:54.231
I'm a lawyer

10:00.484 --> 10:03.508
You were never in love and you were not
do you think you are going to be

10:12.786 --> 10:14.298
How do you do that?
It's a gift

10:17.035 --> 10:18.599
I can tell people things

10:22.282 --> 10:23.783
Miranda ...

10:26.500 --> 10:29.836
I would like to thank you for everything
did you do for me tonight

10:30.166 --> 10:32.042
You already thanked me.
I have not done it.

10:32.706 --> 10:33.644
You have a lot of pain.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.456
I suffer from back pain.
I can heal you

11:16.334 --> 11:17.710
Acu state

11:25.795 --> 11:27.172
turn around

11:41.208 --> 11:42.250
I already feel better

13:21.951 --> 13:23.255
God was incredible!

13:25.247 --> 13:26.498
The pain has disappeared

14:07.247 --> 14:08.999
Davie, Goliath

14:35.527 --> 14:37.153
Are you okay?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.253
Yes

14:42.986 --> 14:44.342
I do not like that song

15:21.793 --> 15:23.774
You can stay here today, if you want

15:33.648 --> 15:35.995
I have many movies, good books, music

16:25.486 --> 16:29.916
And then, I took both hands, put them on
in the back and I felt like it burned me

16:32.276 --> 16:36.238
... and after a second it was fine.
So, did you heal yourself from the back?

16:36.527 --> 16:38.039
Completely
It's incredible

16:38.922 --> 16:41.007
Hey Tim, I have a pain here
Yeah sure

16:43.681 --> 16:47.904
Guys that I missed.
A healing story of Jeff's last conquest.

16:49.479 --> 16:51.720
You slept with her after all, did not you?

16:53.604 --> 16:55.169
Okay, yes
That is my friend!

16:56.420 --> 17:00.226
That's all I did
What do you mean, was it all you did?

17:00.571 --> 17:02.916
Jeff, no, I do not think so
Where are you now?

17:03.261 --> 17:05.190
I leave her sleeping
She ... or man

17:05.900 --> 17:08.038
Did you leave this girl alone in your house?
Yes

17:09.027 --> 17:12.155
Take off your music equipment and
of your television, friend

17:13.881 --> 17:15.444
Come on, they do not know what they say

17:16.226 --> 17:20.710
Listen, I have to go but I would like to see your face
when you come home tonight

17:21.098 --> 17:22.349
See you
See you later

17:23.411 --> 17:25.288
Jeff, do not listen to him, he's envious

17:53.049 --> 17:54.040
welcome home

17:57.414 --> 17:58.353
I can not believe it!

18:04.024 --> 18:06.214
You did not have to clean ...
I wanted to do it.

18:09.366 --> 18:11.920
I was wondering if you would be here when I returned

18:12.493 --> 18:14.629
Are you kidding? I could not leave without saying goodbye

20:44.895 --> 20:48.856
You had some pages of Strauss stuck in the room
Impossible

20:50.333 --> 20:52.210
They are in the trash.
Look at it yourself.

20:58.970 --> 20:59.970
For you.

21:06.248 --> 21:07.551
What are we going to do now

21:09.846 --> 21:11.722
Well, I will try to amend my life

21:13.168 --> 21:16.974
I have a friend in Venice and he would not care
give me shelter for a few weeks

21:20.889 --> 21:21.890
   Friend?

21:25.190 --> 21:27.066
You already called him?

21:29.856 --> 21:32.515
No, I thought I'd do it in the morning if you do not mind

21:34.743 --> 21:38.443
Esc chame, I do not want to bother, I can leave this
night after dinner

21:46.942 --> 21:48.193
I do not want you to go

21:49.888 --> 21:51.609
I want you to stay here with me

21:54.647 --> 21:55.898
I do not know

21:57.919 --> 21:59.482
No promises, no commitments

22:01.993 --> 22:03.922
When you start to hate me, you can leave

22:08.578 --> 22:10.194
And if Otis starts looking for me?

22:13.916 --> 22:18.087
I have to admit that that guy is very strange and
intimidating but it's just a guy

22:24.833 --> 22:26.657
You do not know what you're getting into

22:28.023 --> 22:29.535
Unless you're like the

22:31.255 --> 22:33.027
Do not say that, never say it again

22:58.765 --> 23:00.142
Sorry

23:01.827 --> 23:02.922
I'm sorry, are you okay?

23:04.827 --> 23:07.173
But that guy does not know where I live or who I am

23:08.407 --> 23:10.231
For what is man is history

23:13.686 --> 23:17.127
I'll tell you one thing, if that guy shows up here,
I will split your butt

23:18.851 --> 23:20.102
What do you say?

23:22.533 --> 23:24.160
That's a yes?

23:25.990 --> 23:27.241
I think

23:33.839 --> 23:35.716
Are you sure?

23:36.557 --> 23:37.600
Yes

24:42.796 --> 24:43.995
You will like these

24:48.696 --> 24:49.947
Here it is, thanks

26:39.048 --> 26:40.508
He would never have helped you

26:48.741 --> 26:49.784
Nobody ever leaves us

27:15.596 --> 27:20.027
Hey, I do not know how to thank you, it's what
more wonderful that has happened to me

27:20.404 --> 27:24.836
You're welcome Rock - You must be more careful
from now on, I do not want to go back

27:25.143 --> 27:28.428
To get rid of more problems
You are invincible

27:29.023 --> 27:34.392
Yes, it's fine, the next time you receive a package
of UPS, do not assume that the messenger is a terrorist

27:34.627 --> 27:36.921
Oh that to be careful they are everywhere

27:37.214 --> 27:38.569
ROCK
Hey, it's fine

27:39.235 --> 27:43.666
Remember that when the attacker appears
my house will be camouflaged and with sensors

27:44.073 --> 27:47.357
Intruder proof.
They could come and live with me

27:50.496 --> 27:53.780
It's fantastic, Rock.
Yes, meanwhile ... quiet,  ok?

27:55.448 --> 27:56.282
Yes.

28:03.985 --> 28:08.781
You are incredible, you saw the face of the prosecutor when
Would you request that the trial be lost?

28:09.052 --> 28:11.763
You asked, you demanded it
This is to celebrate

28:12.101 --> 28:16.376
It's true, Saturday at night in my house.
Miranda is crazy to know everyone

28:16.636 --> 28:21.536
The last time we had a party at your house
we stay for breakfast, you think Miranda

28:21.803 --> 28:23.159
Are you ready for that?

28:23.725 --> 28:26.019
That was the Harvey Faster party
Yes Yes

28:26.302 --> 28:29.170
I have a feeling that this
will be more civilized

28:35.917 --> 28:37.586
It's wonderful, Jeff and beautiful

28:40.982 --> 28:42.910
Did you see that he did not steal the TV?

28:49.043 --> 28:50.190
Excuse me for a second

28:50.858 --> 28:51.692
Grace, you came

28:54.712 --> 28:58.570
I hate these streets, they all look alike,
but I'm already here, where is it?

29:00.986 --> 29:02.133
One second, Miranda

29:02.975 --> 29:04.904
Come here I want you to meet someone

29:05.724 --> 29:06.923
Excuse me, I come now

29:07.329 --> 29:08.371
Jeff, it's beautiful

29:09.210 --> 29:10.565
Wait until you meet her

29:12.573 --> 29:17.056
Miranda, she's Grace Woods, my secretary,
the second most important woman in my life

29:19.087 --> 29:20.495
Grace, she's Miranda Reed

29:21.317 --> 29:23.819
I've heard a lot about you,
I'm glad you're here

29:25.653 --> 29:27.405
It is a pleasure

29:29.805 --> 29:31.307
Excuse me?

29:32.607 --> 29:34.693
Are you having fun?
Fantastic

29:39.447 --> 29:41.323
What do I give you?
A Pepsi light

29:45.279 --> 29:49.606
I can not believe that this guy has all the
police films that have been made

29:51.443 --> 29:53.193
Hello Dereck

29:53.541 --> 29:56.982
How are you? And the news business?
Violent as always

29:57.240 --> 29:58.283
We are going to eat something

29:59.585 --> 30:01.358
Could you entertain him for a moment?

30:13.916 --> 30:16.471
You love to eat but you never get fat
It is true

30:18.509 --> 30:20.334
You are happily married
Good...

30:23.415 --> 30:24.875
Here you have a friend
Health

30:27.346 --> 30:28.753
Elise, it looks really good
Yes

30:33.160 --> 30:34.672
You are a lucky bastard

30:35.568 --> 30:37.393
I should have taken her to my house

30:38.012 --> 30:39.159
Maybe it was not your day

30:49.435 --> 30:51.833
You are going to lose something
If the bet of soccer

30:53.191 --> 30:56.006
Something important at the next solstice
What is that?

30:57.835 --> 31:01.485
In December, it is the longest night of the year
it's 12 hours of darkness

31:03.456 --> 31:04.707
It is a very sacred night

31:09.549 --> 31:12.208
That's it, if you excuse me
I'm going to check the turkey

31:50.600 --> 31:51.590
Fantastic party

31:53.489 --> 31:54.615
Thank you

31:55.701 --> 31:58.100
I was crazy to meet Jeff's friends

31:59.499 --> 32:02.471
Those things you said about the solstice
they were fascinating

32:03.202 --> 32:05.442
I did not know you were listening
I could not avoid it

32:07.902 --> 32:12.021
I was curious, you said it was a night
sacred, what religion do you mean?

32:13.815 --> 32:15.014
None in particular

32:16.842 --> 32:20.700
It really comes to mind because
I read poems and I am intrigued by cults

32:21.503 --> 32:22.911
It makes me sound more authentic

32:25.022 --> 32:26.378
It is very effective
Thank you

32:28.286 --> 32:30.580
Do you need help?
No, I think I already have it

32:33.151 --> 32:36.227
Where are you from? - from here by L.A.
Oh, native, how weird

32:39.439 --> 32:41.107
Is it your last name?
Yes it is

32:45.256 --> 32:47.289
You know, Jeff has told me a lot about you

32:48.725 --> 32:50.498
But he did not tell me how they met

32:54.003 --> 32:55.202
We present a friend

32:57.912 --> 33:00.624
One night after Jeff
I left to play basketball

33:01.009 --> 33:02.520
Oh, in PG's?
If it was PG's

33:06.808 --> 33:09.571
It's strange how things went for you and Jeff

33:10.359 --> 33:13.331
the way they met, the way they
you moved

33:15.898 --> 33:18.296
He asked me to move
Of course he did

33:20.151 --> 33:22.497
Why do not you spit it out?
What do you want?

33:24.616 --> 33:26.961
I was about to ask you the same question

33:29.113 --> 33:30.521
I came to help you
Thank you

33:34.392 --> 33:36.143
Do not burn yourself

33:46.505 --> 33:49.894
Then I said, what's the matter?
and he tells me: I do not remember where I live

33:52.601 --> 33:55.677
Ladies and gentlemen, this is serious
I want to propose a toast

33:57.926 --> 34:00.115
Miranda for making such a delicious dinner

34:03.072 --> 34:04.376
And also support Jeff

34:06.653 --> 34:08.061
Thanks and welcome
Health

34:09.947 --> 34:12.813
I want to toast for Jeff,
for having such good taste

34:13.871 --> 34:17.206
And I will be honest with you,
I have never seen Jeff so happy

34:18.496 --> 34:19.853
Congratulations you deserve it

34:44.425 --> 34:46.822
That's it, let's finish in the morning

34:50.469 --> 34:52.503
You were fantastic, everyone loves you

34:59.320 --> 35:00.624
Hello?

35:05.902 --> 35:07.205
Hello?

35:10.343 --> 35:11.844
Who was it?

35:12.266 --> 35:13.620
I do not know, there was nobody

35:14.659 --> 35:15.649
Let's go to bed

35:26.700 --> 35:30.610
Then? What do you say?
It was a great party Jeff everyone had a good time

35:31.834 --> 35:34.024
I do not mean the party, but Miranda

35:34.355 --> 35:36.128
I told you that it seems very nice

35:36.410 --> 35:37.409
Come on!

35:38.088 --> 35:42.051
I think it's a good girl, we have
a lot of work today, we better start

35:42.906 --> 35:44.532
You did not like it

35:45.172 --> 35:48.456
Not my problem
But you have good instincts - I do not have them

35:54.575 --> 35:55.951
It's fine

35:56.578 --> 35:57.954
I do not like

35:59.378 --> 36:00.368
I think it's strange

36:05.126 --> 36:06.252
I minted

36:07.426 --> 36:08.927
On what?

36:09.531 --> 36:11.877
He told me they met in PJ's
Is it true?

36:12.604 --> 36:15.836
No, we met in a parking lot,
her boyfriend was hitting her

36:16.876 --> 36:19.952
Maybe I mined you because I was embarrassed
to tell you the truth

36:20.636 --> 36:22.669
She wanted to please you, you must understand

36:24.990 --> 36:27.545
I take the turkey out of the oven
with his hands and do not burn

36:31.703 --> 36:32.642
Come on!
I saw her

36:35.892 --> 36:37.195
Grace  eso is impossible!

36:38.498 --> 36:40.166
That woman is a problem, Jeff

36:44.851 --> 36:46.832
It's fine, I'll take it as a piece of advice

36:47.772 --> 36:51.004
But I want you to understand that Miranda
it's part of my life now

36:51.923 --> 36:53.747
And I want you to get along

36:54.690 --> 36:55.576
No problem

37:00.119 --> 37:01.496
Perd name

37:02.557 --> 37:04.538
Love is blind

37:10.423 --> 37:13.498
What a good party on Saturday, right?
Of course it was

37:13.911 --> 37:18.395
Can you believe it? that woman could be
a movie star. Who is so lucky?

37:19.568 --> 37:21.184
I heard that Grace does not like her

37:22.302 --> 37:24.960
You know what Grace needs.
Stop the elevator

37:35.216 --> 37:36.519
Hello!
Can I help you?

37:37.110 --> 37:39.457
I come to see Mr. Mills,
he is waiting for me

37:40.755 --> 37:44.091
Your secretary has already left,
but let me see if he's in his office

37:47.242 --> 37:50.371
Hello Jeff, here is a woman
that says you're waiting for her

37:51.825 --> 37:53.963
I'm sorry, what's his name?
Mrs. White

37:57.671 --> 38:00.537
It's okay, it can happen
it is the fifth door on your right

38:01.109 --> 38:02.236
Thank you

38:05.490 --> 38:08.618
I know, I know ... one moment, please
Sit down and I'll answer

38:10.070 --> 38:14.136
Listen Sam, it's getting late  because we do not meet
in the morning?  as at 9:45?

38:17.040 --> 38:17.926
No, no, it's fine

38:21.589 --> 38:22.579
At 3:30 then

38:24.422 --> 38:26.091
See you tomorrow, thank you goodbye.

38:28.735 --> 38:32.384
Mrs. White, I'm sorry I do not remember that
try, when did you ask for your appointment?

38:37.765 --> 38:39.517
I did not ask for an appointment

38:42.745 --> 38:44.674
The secretary said that I expected her

38:47.013 --> 38:48.514
Is not that so?

38:52.053 --> 38:54.921
We are not getting anywhere,
What can I do for you?

39:00.534 --> 39:01.734
We want it back

39:06.127 --> 39:07.503
Excuse me?

39:08.485 --> 39:10.570
You have it and we want it back

39:13.457 --> 39:17.002
You must be kidding, what is it about?
Is it a joke?

39:18.651 --> 39:20.319
Take it as a warning

39:22.477 --> 39:24.104
There will be no other

39:39.366 --> 39:40.242
Hello?

39:40.670 --> 39:42.422
Hello It's Me

39:42.726 --> 39:44.227
Does something happen?

39:44.647 --> 39:45.741
It's nothing, just ...

39:47.186 --> 39:48.490
You know one such  Sra. White?

39:51.134 --> 39:52.135
Miranda?

39:53.001 --> 39:54.200
They found us

39:55.137 --> 39:56.805
What do you mean by "us"?

39:57.144 --> 39:57.977
I have to go

41:43.129 --> 41:44.016
Start the game

43:31.687 --> 43:33.147
We warned you Mr. Mills

43:36.298 --> 43:37.862
You must hear us, Mr. Mills

44:05.189 --> 44:06.065
Hello?

44:06.498 --> 44:07.958
Hello  est  Miranda?

44:08.333 --> 44:10.158
Here nobody lives with that name

44:10.420 --> 44:12.558
Sorry, I must have the wrong number

44:25.846 --> 44:27.098
I'm sorry

44:28.336 --> 44:32.245
I'm a friend of Detective Burman, are you here?
Not now, can I help you?

44:32.593 --> 44:36.555
Fantastic, he said he would be here, look
Maybe you can do me a favor

44:37.334 --> 44:40.253
My girlfriend disappeared three days ago,
I try to find it

44:40.706 --> 44:44.928
Fill out this form so we can do
I'm not denouncing lost people

44:45.326 --> 44:47.985
But he said his girlfriend ...
He left voluntarily

44:48.999 --> 44:51.605
I do not want to make a scene, I have a picture of her

44:54.192 --> 44:57.268
Teach her to the police,
behind is my name and my phone

44:59.892 --> 45:03.802
Believe that that's what we do,
To waste time looking for lost girlfriends?

45:09.213 --> 45:11.089
I think you have a problem Mr. Mills

45:21.326 --> 45:24.141
Mr. Mills, I'm sorry to make you wait
I'm Lieutenant Lee

45:25.051 --> 45:26.428
How is it going

45:29.130 --> 45:30.068
What is it about?

45:31.943 --> 45:33.454
Why do not you tell me?

45:34.600 --> 45:39.449
I showed a picture of my girlfriend to the sergeant
of reception and he said he wanted to talk to me

45:39.800 --> 45:41.176
Do you know her?

45:41.602 --> 45:44.418
No. We've never seen it
So what do I do here?

45:48.907 --> 45:51.149
His girlfriend wears a very rare chain
And?

45:53.585 --> 45:55.670
I ask him sometime how did he get it?

45:57.151 --> 46:01.218
I do not know, his mother gave it to him
He said it was a family heirloom or something like that

46:02.403 --> 46:03.550
What does it mean?
Do not

46:10.786 --> 46:14.748
Mr. Mills, it seems that his girlfriend
is involved with very dangerous people

46:17.566 --> 46:18.922
They practice satanic cults

46:24.313 --> 46:28.223
No offense, Lieutenant, but it's the most ridiculous
I've heard in my life

46:28.623 --> 46:30.292
Miranda is not more evil than me

46:31.361 --> 46:36.419
This goes beyond devil worship we believe that
are responsible for a series of murders

46:36.728 --> 46:39.335
And mysterious disappearances in the county of L.A.

46:39.703 --> 46:41.944
Miranda would never get involved in something like that

46:42.248 --> 46:46.106
I honestly do not know if she is involved or not,
but he is wearing his symbol

46:46.400 --> 46:47.964
It's just a piece of jewelry

47:09.938 --> 47:11.138
I want to teach you something

47:24.879 --> 47:26.381
Who was it?

47:27.554 --> 47:29.054
Who knows

47:31.262 --> 47:34.859
That was the last time I talked to her
Yes - how do they do something like that?

47:35.597 --> 47:38.934
By power, sex, money, who knows,
they have a ritual for everything

47:39.603 --> 47:44.085
The most impressive thing is that the bigger it is
the greatest sacrifice is magic

47:44.377 --> 47:46.358
Do you believe in these things?

47:46.655 --> 47:48.272
I just believe what I see, it's all

47:48.667 --> 47:50.544
Lieutenant, the body is complete

47:51.886 --> 47:55.379
I have to go, we will do everything we can
If you need me, call me

47:59.884 --> 48:01.010
Thank you

48:03.013 --> 48:04.264
Lieutenant

48:05.101 --> 48:06.561
What does that symbol mean?

48:07.743 --> 48:08.994
It depends on how you read it

48:10.262 --> 48:11.774
There is a bookstore in Hollywood

48:13.443 --> 48:15.007
Draw your own conclusions

50:28.023 --> 50:29.170
Go, go, go

51:04.515 --> 51:08.425
I do not know, I'd like a big one, like this size
Do you think you like this one?

51:09.027 --> 51:10.403
It's fine

51:11.047 --> 51:13.705
I can cut the branches
to fit in the room

51:20.840 --> 51:23.708
Are not you going to cheer up? It's Christmas
let's buy the tree

51:30.125 --> 51:32.784
Lieutenant?
Mr. Mills, thank you for coming so fast

51:36.460 --> 51:39.796
I just received these photos,
maybe recognize some people

51:42.438 --> 51:45.201
I know her - who is she?
She calls herself Mrs. White

51:49.036 --> 51:51.956
He visited me in the office
before Miranda left

51:52.933 --> 51:54.393
What did he want?
He said...

51:58.373 --> 51:59.833
... that they wanted her back.

52:07.526 --> 52:09.403
Good evening Grace
Goodnight

52:15.995 --> 52:17.746
A hard day?

52:19.662 --> 52:23.259
Yes ... but I think that this client is really innocent
What good!

52:24.373 --> 52:27.553
The only thing you have to do is try it
Right, tomorrow

52:35.253 --> 52:39.580
If there is anything I can do, some form of
make it come back you know it would

52:40.478 --> 52:41.354
I know

52:43.576 --> 52:46.079
Do you want to have dinner? Or that there is a new restaurant

52:47.213 --> 52:50.028
No thanks I'll stay a while,
but thanks for coming

52:51.621 --> 52:53.341
Just go check if you were okay

53:20.278 --> 53:21.153
Hello?

53:22.166 --> 53:25.502
Jeff, I'm Miranda, I'm in trouble,
please come help me.

54:21.134 --> 54:22.760
Are you okay?

54:23.347 --> 54:24.223
Let's go

54:27.861 --> 54:29.373
What is happening?

54:31.164 --> 54:33.719
I'll explain later, let's see
Right now

54:34.616 --> 54:35.607
Why did you leave?

54:37.714 --> 54:41.207
I was scared, they found us,
Jeff, we have to get out of here!

54:42.960 --> 54:44.629
Not until you explain this to me

54:51.429 --> 54:52.472
It's not what you think

54:54.005 --> 54:55.621
I will explain everything to you, but not here!

54:56.421 --> 54:57.933
You have evaded me many times

54:59.399 --> 55:00.493
Well, I'm leaving

55:04.532 --> 55:05.658
  Day it!

55:07.788 --> 55:09.540
Get in the car

55:30.620 --> 55:32.122
I hear you

55:36.678 --> 55:38.294
Do you know what a Coven is?

55:39.871 --> 55:41.227
Yes, it's a group of witches

55:46.386 --> 55:48.002
Well ... my mother is a witch

55:52.745 --> 55:53.996
Continue

55:56.945 --> 56:00.802
Many witches are positive, they practice with
medicinal herbs to cure

56:02.872 --> 56:05.166
But there are others who misuse those powers

56:06.247 --> 56:07.498
They are the ones who persecute me

56:09.649 --> 56:11.057
This is crazy
I know

56:14.455 --> 56:17.114
When I was 10 years old my father died,
my mother changed

56:19.720 --> 56:21.908
We moved from home and made strange friends

56:24.913 --> 56:30.075
They seized everything, our life, our money
all we had was to stop the Aquelarre

56:31.451 --> 56:33.170
I want to teach you something, turn here

56:36.921 --> 56:40.571
They taught me things, like reading the mind,
how to do spells, how to cure

56:50.637 --> 56:54.339
When I was 18, I was allowed to participate
in one of his ceremonies

57:00.134 --> 57:01.698
At first I was excited

57:27.697 --> 57:29.469
I did not know they sacrificed animals

58:48.372 --> 58:49.373
For here

58:59.334 --> 59:00.961
Do you see that house?

59:01.778 --> 59:03.186
My mother used to take me there

59:04.660 --> 59:07.475
It is an evil place
That house? it looks ... so ... -  Normal?

59:10.448 --> 59:12.429
I have seen blood running down its walls

59:14.859 --> 59:19.029
But the worst happens on the beach, just north
from the Ventura County line

59:19.451 --> 59:24.561
The oldest of the Aquelarre meet there
every year on the winter solstice night

59:24.846 --> 59:25.837
Is not that tomorrow?

59:26.967 --> 59:29.991
I will attend that ceremony
for the first time

59:31.982 --> 59:32.972
Why, what happens?

59:34.636 --> 59:38.599
I'm afraid to say it, there's a sacrifice and the
Victim must go voluntarily

59:42.293 --> 59:46.515
At first I thought it was an animal like
in the other ceremonies, but it's not like that

59:47.832 --> 59:49.344
I do not understand
Is a person

59:50.408 --> 59:51.399
They take the heart

59:53.860 --> 59:55.944
We have to go to the police
I can not!

59:57.408 --> 59:59.181
In addition, the police will not believe me

01:00:00.327 --> 01:00:03.038
If they will, I know someone there.
It does not matter

01:00:04.759 --> 01:00:07.573
Those people will not rest
to take revenge on us

01:00:08.551 --> 01:00:09.959
I do not want to live my life like that

01:00:11.551 --> 01:00:12.855
What is the alternative?

01:00:14.643 --> 01:00:18.032
If I could evade them until the solstice ends
I would be free

01:00:18.686 --> 01:00:19.937
What would you achieve with that?

01:00:20.866 --> 01:00:26.184
They believe that whoever wants to break ties with them and
deceive them in the sacred night will break the circle

01:00:27.398 --> 01:00:28.754
Forever, I will be free

01:00:36.082 --> 01:00:39.367
That's why they're trying to catch me now,
They run out of time

01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:44.615
Fuck you!
What do we have ...  24 hours?

01:00:47.341 --> 01:00:50.104
We will hide somewhere,
they will never find us

01:01:05.924 --> 01:01:07.436
Jeff, I'm sorry about all this

01:01:08.336 --> 01:01:11.517
Do not be ridiculous, we'll stay in
a hotel a couple of days

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:16.131
You will hide and I will treat my case and we will be
at home to celebrate Christmas

01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:20.641
The faster we go, the better

01:01:23.206 --> 01:01:24.093
What's up, kid?

01:01:25.601 --> 01:01:26.644
There is someone outside

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.544
Stay here
Jeff, do not go out

01:01:37.412 --> 01:01:38.538
  Goliat!

01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:44.241
Hey,  Goliat!

01:01:47.054 --> 01:01:48.305
There is no one outside

01:01:49.129 --> 01:01:50.954
Surely it was after an animal or something

01:01:51.668 --> 01:01:53.169
But  Jeff!

01:01:55.137 --> 01:01:58.005
Do not worry,
Goliath has escaped before, he will return.

01:02:20.328 --> 01:02:21.684
That's it
Let's see here

01:02:25.999 --> 01:02:27.303
There is someone on the roof

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.859
They found us
Call the police

01:02:33.574 --> 01:02:34.929
They cut the line
What?

01:02:40.846 --> 01:02:42.463
There was a face in the window

01:03:46.668 --> 01:03:48.127
Ok, go to the bedroom

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:50.194
Come on!

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:59.649
There were about 10 of them
in the bedroom window

01:04:00.323 --> 01:04:01.157
They are looking at us

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.820
What the hell was that?

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.521
It's a shield of protection,
It will not last long and they know it

01:05:49.859 --> 01:05:51.787
I'm not that powerful
Let's go from here!

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.241
We can not leave, they are out

01:05:54.925 --> 01:05:57.897
We will be safe inside the circle
Inside the circle?

01:05:59.146 --> 01:06:00.971
Jeff, please, you have to believe me

01:06:28.039 --> 01:06:30.698
That will keep us safe
at least during the night

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:33.709
And if they come back, are you sure it will work?

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:37.171
They will not enter while we both believe in it

01:06:41.175 --> 01:06:42.218
I should obey you

01:07:50.604 --> 01:07:51.490
Let's see here

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.468
Can we enter?
Of course, enter

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:46.121
If I had not seen things like that, I would not believe it
But you believe me -I'm with you but ...

01:08:46.408 --> 01:08:47.504
How are you going to handle it?

01:08:49.095 --> 01:08:50.345
I do not know

01:08:50.984 --> 01:08:55.154
We must leave the city for a couple of days
What do you mean? Miranda must leave

01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:56.953
I will go with her

01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.676
What will happen to Eli's case?
Do not you have an appointment in court today?

01:09:02.107 --> 01:09:06.069
Wait a minute, you've been preparing
two months, you're not going to spoil it

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:10.399
I know you're a good guy but, I will not let you
ruin your career for a ...

01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:17.761
Everything will be fine

01:09:19.966 --> 01:09:21.323
I know what I do

01:09:45.938 --> 01:09:50.055
  Brujas ?,  Brujas! it's the most
ridiculous that I've heard in my life!

01:09:51.015 --> 01:09:54.717
Yes but trust me,  ok?
Do not confide in me, tréeme to those sorcerers

01:09:55.223 --> 01:09:56.787
And I will teach you what is good

01:09:57.191 --> 01:10:00.214
We go where they
We have to go to the office

01:10:00.499 --> 01:10:01.437
Do not worry

01:10:02.634 --> 01:10:06.440
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine, I do not think they go through these walls

01:10:11.398 --> 01:10:13.066
Do you go back?
I'll be back at 5

01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:16.808
At 6 we will be on an airplane and everything will end

01:10:18.731 --> 01:10:19.858
Let's see

01:10:23.143 --> 01:10:25.020
Thanks Rock

01:10:40.183 --> 01:10:42.946
Mr. Conelly will be ready to leave in 10 minutes

01:10:43.279 --> 01:10:45.156
Well thanks

01:10:45.532 --> 01:10:47.304
Also Mrs. White wants to see you

01:10:51.161 --> 01:10:52.256
Okay, what happens

01:11:01.363 --> 01:11:02.822
   Another warning, Mrs. White?

01:11:03.803 --> 01:11:05.304
He already had it

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:10.545
Maybe he comes to congratulate me on last night's victory

01:11:14.423 --> 01:11:16.873
I think he still has something that belongs to us

01:11:18.109 --> 01:11:19.829
Miranda is not yours
of course

01:11:23.515 --> 01:11:24.401
And always will be

01:11:25.746 --> 01:11:27.154
You can not win ... Mr. Mills

01:11:29.529 --> 01:11:30.468
We have it surrounded

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.855
You can not even go to the bathroom
without it we knew

01:11:35.552 --> 01:11:37.794
I've had enough
leave my office

01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:39.977
Go now or call the police

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.623
Please!
Get it!

01:11:43.356 --> 01:11:47.421
I'm sure Miranda will thank you
that he has sent his mother to jail

01:11:48.226 --> 01:11:49.603
Good God!

01:11:52.918 --> 01:11:54.535
We have friends everywhere

01:11:56.193 --> 01:11:57.819
Up in Ohio

01:12:01.393 --> 01:12:02.958
Even in S Condadoneca County

01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:07.640
We unveiled your mother several nights ago

01:12:08.735 --> 01:12:10.142
I used his bones myself

01:12:12.567 --> 01:12:13.944
Get off!

01:12:14.453 --> 01:12:15.288
Get out of here!

01:12:35.482 --> 01:12:36.472
What is happening?

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:41.637
Grace calls security

01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:45.607
Hey!
C llese!

01:12:47.436 --> 01:12:48.427
C maldllese damn it be

01:12:51.007 --> 01:12:52.571
I never come back here, do you hear me?

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:56.256
And get away from my house, do you understand?

01:12:58.126 --> 01:13:02.714
Miranda will never come back with you,
Never!  entendi ? leave it, it's pretending not to touch it

01:13:04.221 --> 01:13:05.264
Stay with us

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.785
Jeez Jeff, what the hell ...
Do not mess

01:13:11.284 --> 01:13:12.786
It's fine

01:13:14.103 --> 01:13:17.961
  Mills! We have cut in 25 minutes, collect
your files and go to my office

01:13:35.026 --> 01:13:36.027
Let's go

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:40.985
Grab the Rock phone

01:13:44.979 --> 01:13:48.629
Mills, where do you think you're going?
I have to go home, I have an emergency

01:13:49.038 --> 01:13:53.104
If you have an emergency call 091
You must go to court right now

01:14:43.024 --> 01:14:44.378
Rock, where is Miranda?

01:14:46.476 --> 01:14:47.571
Rock Where is it?

01:14:53.482 --> 01:14:54.358
Shit

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:16.389
Wait a minute, what are you doing here?
I'm sorry I think I made a mistake

01:18:16.893 --> 01:18:20.646
I must be in the wrong house
  Marilyn! - please stop and I'm leaving

01:18:21.095 --> 01:18:24.797
What is happening? go from my house
before I call the police

01:18:31.323 --> 01:18:32.261
Where is it?

01:18:36.164 --> 01:18:38.354
Answer curse, where is Miranda?

01:18:39.207 --> 01:18:41.969
I'll give it 5 seconds
to get out of here

01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:51.615
What's here
Do not tell him anything, go home

01:18:55.644 --> 01:18:59.137
Miranda, can you hear me? - do something
Stupid son of a bitch - C llese

01:19:35.641 --> 01:19:37.570
Stop, have you heard? stop, stop now

01:20:15.093 --> 01:20:16.552
Go away
Where is it?

01:20:17.274 --> 01:20:19.025
It's too late

01:20:20.696 --> 01:20:22.729
Tell me where it is or I break your arm

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:25.278
C llate Ed

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.539
It's in ... - C llate Ed
On Towers beach.

01:21:22.297 --> 01:21:23.600
I should never leave her alone

01:21:26.497 --> 01:21:29.051
If something happens to him
Do not talk like that, we'll stop them

01:21:32.933 --> 01:21:37.156
Call the policeman you told me about,
He said he would notify the Ventura police

01:21:37.952 --> 01:21:39.828
We agreed to meet at the beach

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:46.288
Lee was right, these people are not sorcerers,
they are Satanists you should have seen that altar

01:21:46.632 --> 01:21:48.258
No thanks

01:21:54.195 --> 01:21:56.228
Do not worry Ace, we will recover it

01:22:15.404 --> 01:22:16.291
This is useless

01:22:19.087 --> 01:22:23.102
We are 3 miles according to the map
that Towers beach should be here

01:22:39.664 --> 01:22:42.427
It's fine, I'll take a look, you see the police

01:22:42.829 --> 01:22:43.976
Wait, get this

01:22:46.725 --> 01:22:49.957
Thanks, I'm counting on you
Do not commit stupidity, I'll be back

01:22:52.228 --> 01:22:53.114
Do not worry

01:24:08.296 --> 01:24:10.048
SAT N GOVERNMENT

01:25:04.446 --> 01:25:06.115
We invoke the power of the wind

01:25:19.975 --> 01:25:21.435
We have the vision of the moon

01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.742
Scan, scan, scan

01:25:48.138 --> 01:25:49.598
Come to us Sat n,
Scan, scan

01:26:08.422 --> 01:26:09.934
Come to us Sat n,
Scan, scan

01:26:32.862 --> 01:26:34.165
welcome to the party

01:26:36.587 --> 01:26:37.734
We were waiting for you

01:26:39.163 --> 01:26:40.518
You're a damn sick man,

01:29:52.442 --> 01:29:55.205
I knew you would come and my life would spread again

01:30:19.418 --> 01:30:22.128
As I told you Ace, if you do not take care of your back,
Who will do it?

01:31:04.022 --> 01:31:05.169
I'll see you in hell

01:31:35.861 --> 01:31:39.510
In this time of mourning, we must remember that
the souls of our loved ones

01:31:42.126 --> 01:31:44.054
That now rest in a better place

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.728
The Lord is my shepherd, nothing is missing,
in places of delicate pasture it will make me lie down

01:31:56.690 --> 01:32:00.444
Comfort my soul, guide me through paths of justice
for love of his name

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:05.571
Although I walk in the valley of the shadows,
I will not fear any evil,

01:32:11.063 --> 01:32:12.314
I'm sorry

01:32:13.517 --> 01:32:15.081
  Dereck Clear?
Lieutenant Lee

01:32:16.645 --> 01:32:18.574
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

01:32:19.616 --> 01:32:21.232
What is the lieutenant problem?

01:32:23.933 --> 01:32:28.312
When was the last time you saw Jeff Mills?
Two weeks ago, before Christmas

01:32:28.719 --> 01:32:33.201
And he has not talked to him anymore?
No, he said he was going on adventures, he would go to Mexico

01:32:34.368 --> 01:32:35.463
With her friend, Miranda

01:32:37.822 --> 01:32:39.490
Were you friends with the deceased?
Do not

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.348
Grace Woods called me after
of Jeff's disappearance

01:32:47.564 --> 01:32:50.275
his accident happened when he was going to see me at my office

01:32:51.848 --> 01:32:55.914
I told Grace before he died that Jeff was
I had gone to Mexico, and I did not believe

01:32:58.936 --> 01:32:59.927
Apparently not.

01:33:01.904 --> 01:33:04.511
Between you and me lieutenant, Grace drank too much

01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:08.932
Maybe that caused his accident,
I'm right?

01:33:10.099 --> 01:33:12.549
They found alcohol in their blood, it is correct

01:33:13.726 --> 01:33:16.229
Well, it's shocking when you discover it

01:33:18.239 --> 01:33:20.585
It's hard when you do not have to contact him

01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:24.870
Do not worry, go back
home sooner or later

01:33:26.449 --> 01:33:28.795
If you excuse me, I have to go back to the office

01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:50.571
I think it will be ready in six months
if there are no problems with the patent

01:33:50.943 --> 01:33:52.559
- That sounds great for my Phil

01:33:52.914 --> 01:33:56.406
Why do not you let me do the legal paperwork?
No, I could not pay you

01:33:57.148 --> 01:34:00.432
I love the idea, you could pay me
when you sell the product

01:34:01.091 --> 01:34:02.186
Okay, thanks

01:34:04.431 --> 01:34:08.184
I wish my parents were alive to see this,
they would be very proud

01:34:08.779 --> 01:34:09.978
Har s what I tell you

01:34:11.455 --> 01:34:13.332
Holy shit

01:34:15.543 --> 01:34:16.742
Stay away from her

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:25.380
Are you okay? - it's fine
You do not know what you're getting into, friend

01:34:30.483 --> 01:34:31.526
Let's see Miranda ...

01:34:34.913 --> 01:34:36.414
Miranda ...
