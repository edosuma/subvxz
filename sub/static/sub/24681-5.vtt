00:06.820 --> 00:09.380
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.456 --> 00:11.515
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.591 --> 00:14.424
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.494 --> 00:16.155
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:17.931 --> 00:20.593
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.830
I'm an important public figure.

00:23.937 --> 00:26.804
Is this what they teach
you in Sunday school?

00:26.873 --> 00:29.603
Kidnapping helpless
women? You hypocrites!

00:30.344 --> 00:34.303
I wish there was a God, so he
could smack you across the face!

00:34.414 --> 00:36.746
Okay,
the other one.

00:38.785 --> 00:41.151
Please, please don't
hurt me. Please, please.

00:44.257 --> 00:47.192
Listen up, fat girl. We're
going to make a tape, okay?

00:47.260 --> 00:50.423
When you feel a tap on your
shoulder, repeat after me,

00:50.497 --> 00:54.797
"Uncle Wayne, it's April.
This is a ransom message. "

00:58.705 --> 01:03.472
"Uncle Wayne, it's April.
This is a ransom message. "

01:05.579 --> 01:07.740
We are one nation under God.

01:07.814 --> 01:09.748
We shouldn't have to re-write
the Pledge of Allegiance

01:09.816 --> 01:11.681
just to appease
a godless minority.

01:11.752 --> 01:14.152
If your mother had been able
to be here today, Reverend,

01:14.221 --> 01:17.884
<i>she'd point out the Pledge
was already rewritten in 1954</i>

01:17.958 --> 01:20.222
to add the words
"under God. "

01:20.460 --> 01:22.155
Well, the fact that
she didn't show up today

01:22.229 --> 01:24.527
speaks more loudly than
anything she would have said.

01:24.631 --> 01:26.622
Thank you,
Reverend Douglas Callaway.

01:26.700 --> 01:27.928
We'll be back
after the break

01:28.001 --> 01:30.435
with calls
from our listeners.

01:32.038 --> 01:34.063
Reverend, you have
a call from your brother.

01:34.141 --> 01:35.836
He says it's
very important.

01:36.977 --> 01:40.936
Good news, Granny. Your son
agreed, no questions asked.

01:42.149 --> 01:44.014
I'm on my way into the
city for the pick-up.

01:44.084 --> 01:45.642
Be ready
when I get back.

01:45.719 --> 01:47.277
Thank you, Detective.

01:47.354 --> 01:48.582
They said not to
call the police!

01:48.655 --> 01:49.815
I can't believe
you called them.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.585
I can't believe
you didn't.

01:52.058 --> 01:54.356
Faster, Garth.
He's in a hurry.

01:56.563 --> 01:57.552
Where's the girl?

01:57.631 --> 01:59.428
You know, she got away, you know?

01:59.499 --> 02:01.558
She had to use the
bathroom, so I untied her.

02:01.635 --> 02:02.829
That's when she
made a run for it.

02:02.903 --> 02:04.598
Where's Mo?
He went on a beer run.

02:04.671 --> 02:07.834
You find him and you
bring him back to the place.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.750 --> 03:27.015
The room was rented two days
ago and pre-paid for two weeks.

03:28.355 --> 03:30.380
Might've been this guy,
the clerk's not sure.

03:30.457 --> 03:32.482
How many perps are we talking about?

03:32.559 --> 03:35.392
The granddaughter, April, thinks
that there were three males.

03:36.196 --> 03:39.256
She was tied to the bed,
blindfolded the whole time.

03:39.332 --> 03:41.630
Latent isn't coming up with any prints.

03:42.035 --> 03:44.299
No fingerprints and
they leave this guy.

03:44.371 --> 03:47.499
No ID.
Nothing in his pockets.

03:47.574 --> 03:51.408
Well, it looks like they were
gonna kill the granddaughter, too.

03:51.478 --> 03:53.139
The plastic on the floor
to catch the fluid

03:53.213 --> 03:55.477
from leaking into
the room downstairs.

03:57.651 --> 04:00.586
You know,
with no maid service,

04:00.654 --> 04:04.420
it'd take a few days for the
decomp to attract attention.

04:04.491 --> 04:06.982
It's recently fired.
Two rounds missing.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.834
GSR. He fired
one of those rounds.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.370
I hope that's
not contagious.

04:19.439 --> 04:20.463
Eczema.

04:22.175 --> 04:25.167
So he probably
shot Mrs. Callaway,

04:25.245 --> 04:27.042
used a pillow to
muffle the sound...

04:29.716 --> 04:34.983
One of his accomplices
took his gun and shot him.

04:35.822 --> 04:38.814
Easier to split 500
grand two ways than three.

04:42.729 --> 04:46.529
I had to use the bathroom,
so one of them untied me...

04:47.300 --> 04:50.667
He was alone, so I shoved
him and I ran out the door.

04:51.137 --> 04:53.071
You took a big risk, running, April.

04:55.508 --> 04:57.601
Those guys
kept hitting me.

04:58.278 --> 05:00.371
I shouldn't have
left my grandma.

05:00.447 --> 05:02.074
That wasn't your fault.

05:02.315 --> 05:06.308
Now, the morning that you were
kidnapped, you were at her house?

05:06.620 --> 05:11.421
I live with her and my Uncle
Wayne, since my mom died.

05:12.258 --> 05:15.523
11:00, was that your usual
time to leave the house?

05:15.829 --> 05:20.630
No. We usually left around
9:00, just after Uncle Wayne,

05:20.700 --> 05:22.964
and we'd go to the
Atheists' Federation.

05:23.470 --> 05:24.960
All three of you worked there?

05:25.038 --> 05:27.199
It's sort of like
a family business.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.007
But Grandma and me
were supposed to be

05:29.075 --> 05:31.066
on the Martha Maxwell
radio show at noon,

05:32.112 --> 05:34.706
with my dad,
he's Reverend Callaway.

05:36.049 --> 05:38.882
The three men who kidnapped
you, did you hear their names?

05:40.787 --> 05:41.811
No.

05:42.656 --> 05:44.453
Could you tell
which one was in charge?

05:44.524 --> 05:46.583
The one who made me make the tape.

05:46.660 --> 05:49.390
Did you notice anything
special about him?

05:49.462 --> 05:50.861
Maybe he had an accent,

05:53.199 --> 05:54.689
unusual smell?

05:55.835 --> 05:57.063
A smell.

05:58.438 --> 06:02.898
His hands smelled like
when they fix a roof.

06:03.877 --> 06:05.367
Tar.
You mean that smell?

06:05.745 --> 06:06.803
Yes.

06:08.014 --> 06:10.312
He's the one
that would hit me.

06:10.383 --> 06:12.010
We'll talk later.
Excuse me.

06:16.823 --> 06:20.987
Tar's an ingredient that's
used in a cream to treat eczema.

06:22.996 --> 06:26.557
So the one who was shot,
that was the man in charge.

06:26.633 --> 06:27.827
Until the ransom
got paid.

06:29.569 --> 06:32.868
Eames. We got a hit on his prints.

06:35.408 --> 06:37.535
His name's
Larry Hastings.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.635
I've never heard of him.
Neither have I.

06:39.779 --> 06:43.306
The kidnappers knew the name
of your organization's bank

06:43.783 --> 06:45.717
and what your financial resources were.

06:45.785 --> 06:47.446
It's all in our annual report.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.782
But this wasn't about money.

06:48.855 --> 06:49.947
This was about silencing our movement.

06:51.091 --> 06:52.752
My mother was the
Atheists' Federation.

06:52.826 --> 06:54.794
Without her,
it doesn't exist.

06:54.861 --> 06:56.385
Fanatics
were behind this.

06:56.863 --> 06:58.831
You suggesting we look at
the Reverend's organization?

06:58.898 --> 07:01.196
I have a ministry,
not an organization.

07:01.267 --> 07:02.734
Anyway, my mother may have been

07:02.802 --> 07:05.168
the region's most
notorious atheist...

07:05.238 --> 07:08.002
The most prominent. She
received dozens of death threats.

07:08.074 --> 07:09.564
She used to
receive hundreds.

07:09.642 --> 07:11.974
Her days as a lightning rod
were over.

07:12.045 --> 07:13.910
When can I see my niece?

07:13.980 --> 07:16.312
The officer
will take you to her.

07:21.855 --> 07:23.345
Reverend, if you want
to see your daughter...

07:23.423 --> 07:25.721
She'll be fine
with my brother.

07:29.529 --> 07:33.056
Reminds me why my parents never
talked religion at the dinner table.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.291
What else do we have on Larry Hastings?

07:35.368 --> 07:37.461
He got out of Elmira
two years ago.

07:37.537 --> 07:39.801
He did four years
for armed robbery.

07:39.873 --> 07:41.238
What about the ransom?

07:41.307 --> 07:44.242
It was wired from the
Federation's bank yesterday

07:44.310 --> 07:45.641
to a Terrence Winter,

07:46.880 --> 07:48.438
care of a coin dealer
in Midtown.

07:49.215 --> 07:52.184
Now, someone matching
Hastings' description

07:53.753 --> 07:56.347
came in flashing a
passport with Winter's name.

07:56.422 --> 07:57.514
Fake passport, probably.

07:59.392 --> 08:03.158
The store paid him in gold
coins. 1,400 Krugerrands.

08:04.164 --> 08:08.362
Larry Hastings has a car registered
to an address in Jackson Heights.

08:31.057 --> 08:32.820
Somebody
burned a passport.

08:32.892 --> 08:36.089
Could be the fake one
Larry used at the coin shop.

08:36.462 --> 08:37.690
Maybe his buddies got rid of it,

08:37.764 --> 08:41.894
so we couldn't trace it back to
the guy who forged their passports.

08:43.535 --> 08:46.699
Buttons from jeans,
shoelace eyelets.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.676
Looks like they dissolved
their clothes in here with lye.

08:50.743 --> 08:54.179
The same clothes that they
wore during the kidnapping.

08:54.247 --> 08:56.579
Smart buddies,
getting rid of evidence

08:56.649 --> 08:59.812
that could tie them to
the kidnapping or to Larry.

09:00.987 --> 09:03.854
We've got 16 eyelets,
six buttons.

09:05.024 --> 09:07.686
One pair of shoes,
one pair of pants.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.853
Maybe only
one smart buddy.

09:12.665 --> 09:16.123
If Larry used his car to pick up
the coins, drive back to the motel,

09:18.504 --> 09:20.062
what are these doing here?

09:21.641 --> 09:24.303
The mud inside
the wells isn't dry.

09:24.744 --> 09:28.043
This car's been driven
off-road in the last 12 hours.

09:28.781 --> 09:34.117
All this stuff, flares, tool
kit, all should be in the trunk.

09:34.787 --> 09:37.585
Somebody moved it,
to make room.

09:42.962 --> 09:44.224
Driver got mud
on his shoes.

09:46.733 --> 09:47.995
Ketchup.

09:50.203 --> 09:51.670
It's still gummy.

09:51.738 --> 09:53.603
Maybe same vintage
as the mud.

10:00.079 --> 10:02.013
Plenty of room
for a buddy.

10:03.216 --> 10:06.811
Well, two buddies left the
motel in Larry's car last night.

10:08.321 --> 10:10.653
Only one buddy
made it back here.

10:10.723 --> 10:13.715
Definitely easier to
split 500 grand one way.

10:16.829 --> 10:18.956
Hey, could you have
someone check the last entry

10:19.032 --> 10:21.023
on the GPS
in the car?

10:21.100 --> 10:22.294
Thanks.

10:24.704 --> 10:27.002
I don't know
any Larry Hastings.

10:27.073 --> 10:30.270
Your fingerprint was found on
a ketchup packet in his car.

10:30.343 --> 10:32.004
Any idea how
it got there?

10:32.078 --> 10:33.978
Maybe we ate at
the same food joint.

10:34.047 --> 10:36.880
Maybe my mitts got on it
when I was getting condiments.

10:36.950 --> 10:39.510
If it's okay to ask, what
did this Larry guy do?

10:39.585 --> 10:41.678
It's okay to ask.
He and his accomplices

10:41.754 --> 10:43.381
kidnapped two women
and killed one of them.

10:44.657 --> 10:46.522
There's nothing flashy
like that on my sheet,

10:46.592 --> 10:47.957
just a credit card beef.

10:48.027 --> 10:49.961
Well, we're not
accusing you of anything.

10:50.029 --> 10:51.690
I guess I ought
to call my lawyer.

10:51.764 --> 10:54.062
He's in White Plains. That's
where I got into trouble.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.158
You guys are so
wrong about this.

10:56.235 --> 10:57.497
I've been at work
all week.

10:57.570 --> 10:58.969
Were you working yesterday?

10:59.038 --> 11:00.630
No, yesterday was my day off.

11:00.707 --> 11:03.835
I did errands.
Great. Disconnected.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.674
Your work,
you're a masseur.

11:06.746 --> 11:07.770
That your table?

11:07.847 --> 11:09.781
I'm a massage therapist.

11:09.849 --> 11:13.285
State certified. At
the VA Hospital on 23rd.

11:14.287 --> 11:16.380
I'm on the
straight and narrow.

11:16.456 --> 11:17.980
Last night, you go out?

11:18.057 --> 11:19.217
No, I was home.

11:19.292 --> 11:23.285
So this receipt for 2:19 a. m. Last
night, it just flew in the window?

11:25.398 --> 11:27.093
I had heartburn, I went out for antacid.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.067
It's the good stuff you
can only get at a drugstore.

11:30.803 --> 11:31.963
Doesn't it say
on the receipt?

11:32.038 --> 11:34.268
No. It doesn't say where it's from.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.865
Well, here's the
stuff right here.

11:37.043 --> 11:40.308
<i>I got it at one of them 24
- hour places they have around here.</i>

11:41.514 --> 11:43.277
Hey, I'll move that.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.382
The downloads from the
GPS in Hastings' car.

11:46.452 --> 11:47.885
The last request
was for directions

11:47.954 --> 11:50.354
from West 242nd at
Van Cortlandt Park

11:50.423 --> 11:53.256
in the Bronx back to Hastings' place.

11:53.326 --> 11:56.124
The request was
made at 1:38 a. m.

11:56.829 --> 11:59.730
If it was Mitch here,
that's cutting it close.

12:00.700 --> 12:05.069
Van Cortlandt Park, it's
still muddy this time of year.

12:06.672 --> 12:08.936
Drag marks led
right to the body.

12:11.110 --> 12:12.873
Strangulation
from behind.

12:13.913 --> 12:15.346
Ligature marks
are well-defined,

12:15.415 --> 12:17.815
except for where
they join at the back.

12:17.884 --> 12:18.942
They're blurred.

12:19.018 --> 12:21.350
It looks like there's
more than one set of marks.

12:21.421 --> 12:25.187
See where the ropes crisscross?
Right hand was on top.

12:25.858 --> 12:28.452
Maybe he didn't have enough
strength with that hand,

12:29.962 --> 12:32.988
so he switched to the left.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.467
Maybe the right hand
was weak or injured...

12:37.370 --> 12:40.066
I didn't notice anything
wrong with Mitch's hand.

12:40.139 --> 12:41.663
Neither did I.

12:45.745 --> 12:47.406
Can I get a picture of this, please?

12:54.420 --> 12:56.445
Between this hand
switch and the timeline,

12:56.522 --> 12:59.082
things are looking
pretty good for Mitch.

12:59.692 --> 13:00.750
It's a shame someone went through

13:00.827 --> 13:02.954
all the trouble of
making him look bad.

13:09.368 --> 13:10.801
The lab
found carpet fibers

13:10.870 --> 13:13.236
from the motel in
his socks and shoes.

13:13.639 --> 13:15.834
Down from three
musketeers to one.

13:15.908 --> 13:18.376
Not that I'm complaining, but I'd
rather hang Eleanor Callaway's murder

13:18.444 --> 13:19.536
on a living suspect.

13:19.612 --> 13:20.806
Mitch Godel isn't it.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.213
Nothing turned up at his apartment
or the crime scenes to connect him.

13:24.283 --> 13:26.945
Print on the pack
of ketchup's a fluke?

13:27.019 --> 13:31.353
Except that Mitch is almost a
perfect suspect, he has a prior...

13:32.592 --> 13:36.688
His personality, it
doesn't inspire confidence.

13:36.762 --> 13:39.629
If he got picked for a
frame-up by our third musketeer,

13:39.699 --> 13:41.860
there's got to be a
connection between them.

13:46.272 --> 13:48.672
Nice fit.
A hand splint.

13:49.775 --> 13:51.640
That's why he
switched hands.

13:51.711 --> 13:53.770
The lab found DNA
on this?

13:53.980 --> 13:55.641
From skin cells.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.745
Oh, we'll need
a call to the Feds.

14:01.254 --> 14:06.419
Mitch works at the VA. The third
guy, he's got an injured hand.

14:06.926 --> 14:09.258
I don't know.
He could be a vet.

14:09.829 --> 14:14.562
The military keeps blood and
DNA records on every recruit.

14:17.870 --> 14:20.430
Oh, yeah. Carpal tunnel syndrome.

14:20.506 --> 14:25.409
He wore a hand splint.
Mo Del-something.

14:25.478 --> 14:27.378
Moses Delgado.

14:27.446 --> 14:30.244
The VA said he came here
for treatment last month.

14:30.316 --> 14:35.447
Not from me. Mo sat at my table
in here a couple times. Nice guy.

14:36.222 --> 14:38.588
Really?
You think so?

14:38.658 --> 14:40.990
Because he, you know, tried
to frame you for kidnapping.

14:43.296 --> 14:45.560
No way. Really?
Yeah.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.764
Well, you're practically
made-to-order there, Mitch,

14:48.834 --> 14:50.199
you know,
being an ex-con.

14:50.269 --> 14:53.238
Now, see, I never told
Mo I was in the joint.

14:53.306 --> 14:55.274
Well, you didn't have to.

14:55.741 --> 14:58.175
Clock face without hands,
it's a classic prison tat.

15:01.547 --> 15:03.742
I can't believe
he'd do that to me.

15:03.816 --> 15:05.784
So what did you two find to talk about?

15:05.851 --> 15:08.513
Baseball.
He didn't like the majors.

15:09.522 --> 15:11.922
He was big on some Triple-A team,

15:11.991 --> 15:13.549
the Red Devils. I never heard of them.

15:13.826 --> 15:18.786
Right. The Diablos Rojos, they're
Mexican League. They're Triple-A.

15:19.232 --> 15:22.224
The accounts office had a
current address for Delgado.

15:24.604 --> 15:27.539
That's Mo. Claude's been
letting him sleep on the couch.

15:27.607 --> 15:29.006
And this
would be Claude?

15:29.075 --> 15:32.567
Oh, boy.
Yeah, that's Claude.

15:34.814 --> 15:36.247
He owed 900
bucks in rent.

15:36.315 --> 15:38.545
When was the last time
you saw Mo?

15:38.618 --> 15:40.483
About a week ago.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.350
The landlord's gonna want to
seize this stuff for payment.

15:43.422 --> 15:46.050
Yeah, well, we got
first dibs. Thanks.

15:51.163 --> 15:55.156
Looks like someone
got some new suitcases

15:55.234 --> 15:57.327
and a hard-shell
golf travel bag.

15:57.403 --> 15:59.496
Mo probably
caught a plane.

16:00.239 --> 16:02.264
Gold coins
weigh about 90 pounds.

16:02.341 --> 16:04.605
Split between three
bags, it's easy to hide.

16:06.012 --> 16:07.877
Gold doesn't set
off metal detectors.

16:07.947 --> 16:11.849
Mo's just another gringo tourist carving
divots out of a Mexican golf course.

16:14.654 --> 16:18.954
My mother didn't believe in heaven
or hell or any sort of afterlife.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.226
She did, however,
believe in life.

16:24.263 --> 16:26.857
In accordance
with her wishes,

16:26.932 --> 16:29.025
we scatter her ashes over her garden.

16:31.871 --> 16:33.736
Oh, Heavenly Father, welcome
your wayward daughter...

16:33.806 --> 16:34.864
Douglas,
shut him up.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.066
Forgive her, her sins.

16:36.142 --> 16:38.235
Open her eyes so that
she may accept your glory.

16:38.311 --> 16:39.801
Daddy, please.

16:41.180 --> 16:44.775
You called them?
This is what you want?

16:44.850 --> 16:46.750
To turn her funeral into a spectacle?

16:50.823 --> 16:53.883
Shame on you, Douglas.
Shame on you!

16:59.365 --> 17:02.528
The Feds are passing Moses' mug
on to Interpol and the Mexicans.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.296
I'm not holding my breath.

17:04.369 --> 17:05.928
With a five-day
lead and an alias,

17:06.005 --> 17:07.665
we better pray
he makes a mistake.

17:07.740 --> 17:09.173
I don't know how Eleanor Callaway would

17:09.241 --> 17:12.836
feel about relying on divine
intervention to catch her killer.

17:13.612 --> 17:16.944
I wonder what kind of
help the kidnappers got.

17:17.016 --> 17:19.382
I mean, there's no record
they did any research

17:19.452 --> 17:22.250
into the finances of
the Atheists' Federation.

17:22.521 --> 17:25.251
Look, the Federation had three accounts,

17:27.059 --> 17:29.254
two at a Manhattan Bank,

17:29.762 --> 17:32.162
and a new one at the New Amsterdam Bank.

17:32.965 --> 17:34.432
But the kidnappers
knew most of the money,

17:34.500 --> 17:36.559
500,000, was at
the Manhattan Bank.

17:37.770 --> 17:39.897
Not many ways they could've found out.

17:39.972 --> 17:41.940
Someone either at the
bank or the Federation.

17:45.778 --> 17:47.871
Maybe we can
narrow it down.

17:48.447 --> 17:50.779
The exact time that April and Eleanor

17:50.850 --> 17:52.943
were on the radio,
it wasn't publicized.

17:54.186 --> 17:57.883
But the kidnappers, they had to
know what time they left the house.

17:57.957 --> 18:00.790
Or else they just staked
out the house that morning.

18:02.361 --> 18:05.125
One side of the street was no parking,

18:05.197 --> 18:09.224
and the other side was
blocked off for construction.

18:09.702 --> 18:11.101
They couldn't stay
there long without

18:11.170 --> 18:14.264
running the risk of
being noticed or ticketed.

18:17.343 --> 18:19.504
I've been meaning to
call Victim Services,

18:19.578 --> 18:21.876
but things have been so busy.

18:21.947 --> 18:24.677
Ma'am, we're sorry
to just pop in on you,

18:25.518 --> 18:29.852
but we need to ask you about
the radio show last Tuesday.

18:31.323 --> 18:34.349
Now, you were supposed
to go on at 12:00.

18:34.427 --> 18:35.826
When was that decided?

18:38.164 --> 18:40.189
That morning.
They called Grandma.

18:40.266 --> 18:41.597
Sounds last-minute.

18:41.667 --> 18:45.034
It was. Grandma said that
Dad was late, you know?

18:45.137 --> 18:48.197
He was stuck crossing the
George Washington Bridge.

18:48.274 --> 18:49.502
The Reverend,

18:49.575 --> 18:52.203
your grandmother was gonna
debate him on the show?

18:52.278 --> 18:55.145
We were all gonna be on together.

18:55.214 --> 18:58.047
But my dad, he kept changing the time.

18:58.117 --> 19:02.713
You know, first it was 10:00, then it
was 11:00, and then finally it was noon...

19:04.957 --> 19:07.050
That was just a motorcycle.

19:10.196 --> 19:13.893
You're worried about the
kidnappers. You know, that's normal.

19:15.167 --> 19:20.867
But two of them have died,
and the third looks like

19:20.940 --> 19:21.929
he left the country.

19:22.007 --> 19:24.134
If you want, we can post a car outside.

19:24.643 --> 19:29.444
No, it's okay, you
know. I'm gonna be fine.

19:30.549 --> 19:35.486
April, how did your dad get
along with your grandmother?

19:35.988 --> 19:40.448
Not good, you know, they were
pretty mean to each other.

19:41.494 --> 19:45.123
The Reverend, he was on the
George Washington Tuesday,

19:46.765 --> 19:48.858
but he lives in the city, doesn't he?

19:49.001 --> 19:51.094
Did he have business in New Jersey?

19:51.370 --> 19:54.601
He was coming back
from visiting a prison.

19:54.907 --> 19:57.467
You know, he has ministries
in a whole bunch of places.

20:00.813 --> 20:04.112
That's probably my
Uncle Wayne, so just...

20:07.553 --> 20:08.850
A prison ministry.

20:08.921 --> 20:12.880
Sounds like a good way to meet
quality people like Larry Hastings.

20:13.526 --> 20:16.427
Well, kidnapping his
own mother and daughter.

20:17.763 --> 20:20.561
Looks like prison
converted the Reverend.

20:25.404 --> 20:28.999
Until last year, I did group
meetings at Elmira Prison,

20:29.542 --> 20:32.602
but unless Mr. Hastings
attended regularly

20:33.646 --> 20:34.943
or did individual prayer
with me,

20:35.014 --> 20:36.276
there's no way
I'd remember him.

20:36.348 --> 20:37.713
Maybe one of your assistants does.

20:37.850 --> 20:39.249
Well, feel free to ask.

20:39.318 --> 20:41.752
In fact, whatever you're
looking for, just please ask.

20:41.820 --> 20:44.220
Well, I have a question.

20:44.323 --> 20:47.383
The morning that your
mother was kidnapped,

20:48.894 --> 20:52.489
you visited a prison
in New Jersey.

20:52.565 --> 20:55.432
You get caught in traffic
on the George Washington?

20:55.501 --> 20:57.332
No, I took the tunnel.

20:57.403 --> 20:58.461
Well, is there
another reason why

20:58.537 --> 21:01.028
you couldn't make it to
the radio station by 10:00?

21:01.106 --> 21:02.698
It wasn't that
I couldn't make it.

21:02.775 --> 21:05.039
I called ahead, they said
it had been changed to 12:00.

21:05.110 --> 21:08.011
They said that was because they got
a message you were stuck in traffic.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.479
Well, they didn't get that from me.

21:09.548 --> 21:10.708
Why does it matter?

21:10.783 --> 21:14.446
Well, I'm thinking that, since
you don't know Larry Hastings,

21:14.520 --> 21:17.080
maybe he hooked up with
someone else in your ministry,

21:17.156 --> 21:18.748
you know,
a real zealot?

21:18.824 --> 21:20.348
We don't have
anyone like that.

21:20.693 --> 21:21.955
Oh, come on, Reverend,

21:22.027 --> 21:24.086
maybe someone overheard you
venting about your mother.

21:24.163 --> 21:27.223
What is it that you
said? I have it in here.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.995
"The most dangerous place
in the world

21:31.070 --> 21:33.698
"is between Eleanor Callaway
and a camera. "

21:34.273 --> 21:36.741
Yes, I said that. And it was true.

21:37.009 --> 21:39.944
When did your mother start
the Atheists' Federation?

21:40.512 --> 21:41.740
How old were you? Ten?

21:41.814 --> 21:44.840
She wanted to stop prayer in
the New York public schools.

21:44.917 --> 21:48.375
And she used you as a prop
in her public appearances.

21:48.721 --> 21:52.555
Well, me and Wayne,
like trained puppies.

21:52.958 --> 21:57.156
And then you got born
again. She disowned you.

21:58.897 --> 22:01.832
What did she call it?
I have it.

22:01.900 --> 22:05.392
A "post-birth abortion. "

22:06.405 --> 22:09.636
Eleanor used vulgarity
to generate publicity.

22:09.942 --> 22:11.603
It worked.
She raked in

22:11.677 --> 22:14.043
hundreds of thousands
of dollars in donations.

22:14.313 --> 22:16.008
You had to cut back on your ministry.

22:16.081 --> 22:19.073
We heard you've gone
from 15 prisons to 7.

22:19.151 --> 22:21.381
It must have ticked him
off. Did that tick you off?

22:21.453 --> 22:23.512
You know, you had to see these heathens

22:23.589 --> 22:25.250
filling up your mother's
collection plate?

22:29.528 --> 22:32.588
Do you think I killed
my mother for her money?

22:33.198 --> 22:35.792
We're pretty sure killing her
was something you didn't plan on.

22:35.868 --> 22:38.234
I didn't plan on any of it.
I would never harm my mother,

22:38.303 --> 22:40.032
let alone my own daughter.

22:40.105 --> 22:41.629
What are these?

22:42.174 --> 22:44.165
Notes for the radio show.

22:44.643 --> 22:45.735
Yeah.

22:45.811 --> 22:48.780
You have questions for your
mother, and some for your brother.

22:50.282 --> 22:52.750
Your brother wasn't scheduled
to be on the radio show.

22:53.852 --> 22:54.841
April was.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.252
April never made
media appearances, ever.

22:57.322 --> 22:58.812
It was always
Eleanor and Wayne.

23:00.192 --> 23:01.784
Except this time.

23:04.963 --> 23:06.396
It was April's idea.

23:06.465 --> 23:09.093
She said my mother and I never
gave her any real responsibility.

23:09.168 --> 23:11.636
So we figured, one radio
appearance, what could it hurt?

23:11.704 --> 23:14.104
Did you tell anybody April
was taking your place?

23:14.173 --> 23:15.606
No, in case she changed her mind.

23:15.674 --> 23:17.437
She has no
self-confidence.

23:17.509 --> 23:19.101
Did your brother know?

23:19.178 --> 23:22.272
How would he? None of us talk
to him. Why all these questions?

23:22.347 --> 23:25.407
We think somebody with
inside knowledge was involved.

23:25.484 --> 23:28.385
Who? Douglas? April? I love my niece,

23:28.454 --> 23:30.547
but she couldn't pull
off a surprise party,

23:30.622 --> 23:33.853
let alone a kidnapping. I'm
a better suspect than she is.

23:33.926 --> 23:35.689
Well, we thought of you.

23:35.761 --> 23:37.729
Just because we're atheists doesn't
mean we don't know right from wrong.

23:37.796 --> 23:38.820
Oh.

23:38.897 --> 23:41.024
And we also know
harassment when we see it.

23:44.403 --> 23:46.871
I don't know how much
longer I can live like this.

23:46.939 --> 23:49.430
You know, any minute he
could just... Hold on.

23:49.908 --> 23:51.569
Your uncle's on Line 3.

23:51.643 --> 23:53.804
Just tell him I can't talk
to him right now, okay?

23:53.879 --> 23:55.107
What are these?

23:55.180 --> 23:58.638
One's a polite kiss-off from
one of our biggest contributors.

23:58.717 --> 24:00.309
And the other's
my resignation.

24:01.620 --> 24:04.487
I'm sorry, April, but
with Eleanor gone...

24:05.124 --> 24:08.855
I got another job starting Monday.

24:11.797 --> 24:15.961
Are you still there? I
really need to see you.

24:23.442 --> 24:24.466
Congratulations.

24:24.543 --> 24:26.977
You've managed to unite
atheists and Christians

24:27.045 --> 24:29.036
in common cause against
police harassment.

24:29.114 --> 24:30.342
We do what we can.

24:30.415 --> 24:33.213
What you seem to be doing
is playing musical suspects,

24:33.285 --> 24:37.085
Reverend Callaway, his brother
Wayne, now his daughter April.

24:37.389 --> 24:40.586
Like it or not, this
is standard police work.

24:41.527 --> 24:45.019
While your detectives work their
way down the Callaway family tree,

24:45.097 --> 24:48.362
the third kidnapper, Mr.
Delgado, remains at large.

24:48.433 --> 24:50.594
You don't need to
remind us.

24:51.236 --> 24:54.103
Tell the counselor what
you have on April Callaway.

24:54.173 --> 24:56.141
After eliminating her
father and her uncle,

24:56.208 --> 24:59.837
she's the only one left with
knowledge of the Federation's finances.

25:01.213 --> 25:04.614
And she insisted on accompanying
Eleanor to the radio show,

25:05.717 --> 25:08.413
but her story about why it was
delayed, it doesn't hold up.

25:08.487 --> 25:11.251
It looks like she tried to
throw suspicion on the Reverend.

25:11.323 --> 25:12.585
And then there's her behavior.

25:12.658 --> 25:16.219
On the one hand, she shows
signs of post-traumatic stress.

25:16.295 --> 25:18.559
On the other,
she won't get help for it.

25:18.630 --> 25:21.428
We know she never
contacted Victim Services.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.934
That hardly means she
conspired in her own kidnapping.

25:26.705 --> 25:32.735
Look, if she's a victim, let's
see if she behaves like one.

25:36.982 --> 25:39.246
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to, April.

25:39.318 --> 25:43.516
We really do need to run through
the details of her escape.

25:44.623 --> 25:47.023
It's okay.
I want to help.

25:48.360 --> 25:52.729
So, now, you told us that
there was only one man in here

25:52.798 --> 25:54.595
with you and
your grandmother.

25:54.666 --> 25:57.635
Now, was that the same man that
had the smell of tar on his hands?

25:57.703 --> 25:58.829
No, it wasn't.

25:58.904 --> 26:01.634
Or maybe he had a
brace on his right hand?

26:01.707 --> 26:03.675
Maybe you felt it
when he grabbed you?

26:03.742 --> 26:08.873
Now, you were on the bed when
you asked to use the bathroom.

26:10.949 --> 26:12.280
How were you positioned?

26:12.351 --> 26:14.512
I was sort of sitting up.

26:16.021 --> 26:19.821
I had a rope around my
hands and at my waist.

26:20.792 --> 26:22.487
And I had a
blindfold on.

26:22.561 --> 26:25.155
It would be better if you
got on the bed and showed us.

26:35.274 --> 26:37.367
I was sitting like this.

26:38.543 --> 26:40.204
You're a real trouper,
April.

26:40.746 --> 26:45.376
I mean, a lot of former hostages,
they couldn't do this. Right?

26:45.450 --> 26:49.113
Oh, yes. They start hyperventilating
just stepping into a place

26:49.187 --> 26:50.176
where they've been kept.

26:51.890 --> 26:57.954
Well, you know, I am starting
to feel a little bit panicky.

27:00.399 --> 27:02.094
Like I can't breathe.

27:04.469 --> 27:06.494
We brought
a therapist with us

27:06.571 --> 27:08.937
from Victim Services,
in case this happened.

27:09.007 --> 27:10.770
She's waiting downstairs in a car.

27:10.842 --> 27:11.831
I don't want her.

27:11.910 --> 27:15.073
Well, you know, she could
help you work out your fear.

27:15.147 --> 27:17.741
It's okay.
I don't need a therapist.

27:19.618 --> 27:20.710
I...

27:23.088 --> 27:24.316
I was...

27:27.459 --> 27:29.427
I was tied up like this.

27:32.364 --> 27:34.832
April, you can
open your eyes now.

27:36.635 --> 27:42.835
Look, we noticed that you've been jumpy.

27:44.309 --> 27:46.800
Is there something that
you wanna talk about?

27:46.878 --> 27:47.936
No.

27:48.013 --> 27:49.537
We hope you're talking
to somebody.

27:50.882 --> 27:52.110
Like who?

27:52.184 --> 27:54.584
You know, a friend,
a boyfriend.

27:55.921 --> 27:57.912
I don't have boyfriends.

27:59.191 --> 28:00.715
I want to go home now.

28:04.262 --> 28:05.286
Ow!

28:05.364 --> 28:07.355
Something
wrong with your legs?

28:07.432 --> 28:11.391
It's just my knees. I
have rheumatoid arthritis,

28:11.470 --> 28:13.131
you know,
because of my weight.

28:13.205 --> 28:14.729
What are you
taking for it?

28:14.806 --> 28:16.933
It's, like,
hydroxy-something.

28:17.609 --> 28:19.804
Well, because, you know,
physical therapy helps.

28:19.878 --> 28:22.711
I know, but I haven't
been in, like, two weeks.

28:25.350 --> 28:27.341
A little panicky, my foot.

28:27.419 --> 28:31.287
I've seen kidnap victims throw up
just talking about their ordeal.

28:31.757 --> 28:34.317
It's not what happened that keeps her
up at night, it's what might happen.

28:34.393 --> 28:38.022
Like going to prison. No wonder
she doesn't want to see a therapist.

28:38.663 --> 28:42.861
She doesn't seem to mind physical
therapy, neither does Moses Delgado.

28:42.934 --> 28:44.959
A lot of people
getting body work.

28:45.037 --> 28:46.129
Or giving it.

28:52.044 --> 28:53.773
Yeah, the insurance company's correct.

28:53.845 --> 28:55.904
We treated April Callaway for arthritis.

28:55.981 --> 28:58.142
She had three sessions
in February.

28:58.216 --> 29:01.049
She told us she was treated
as recently as two weeks ago.

29:01.119 --> 29:02.313
Not by us.

29:02.387 --> 29:04.685
The insurance did
authorize 20 visits, though.

29:05.023 --> 29:06.684
What about
Moses Delgado?

29:06.758 --> 29:08.589
You ever have
him as a patient?

29:10.629 --> 29:11.653
No.

29:12.330 --> 29:14.696
Ms. Callaway's treatments,
did they include massage?

29:14.766 --> 29:16.700
Yes.

29:16.768 --> 29:18.429
A Mitch Godel
ever work here?

29:18.503 --> 29:21.597
Yes, until a year and
a half ago. He resigned.

29:22.007 --> 29:23.770
He resigned.

29:23.842 --> 29:25.104
Well, that's a funny way
to put it.

29:25.444 --> 29:28.140
She could've said "quit. "

29:28.213 --> 29:31.410
I guess people here
are asked to resign.

29:32.717 --> 29:34.651
Is that what happened
with Mitch?

29:35.487 --> 29:36.579
Yes.

29:36.955 --> 29:39.287
We heard he was stealing
patients from the clinic

29:39.357 --> 29:41.450
and giving them
private massages.

29:41.526 --> 29:44.893
Ms. Callaway's three sessions,
who was her masseur?

29:45.397 --> 29:49.026
I don't know why she stopped
coming after three sessions.

29:49.101 --> 29:52.798
One thing I'll say, she was
not comfortable being touched.

29:52.871 --> 29:54.998
Even by you?
Hard to believe.

29:56.108 --> 29:58.599
I'll pretend that
was a compliment.

29:58.944 --> 30:01.936
Some people just don't like
massage. They feel too vulnerable.

30:02.013 --> 30:03.776
Oh, it was her vulnerability, I guess.

30:03.915 --> 30:05.712
That's what stopped
her from coming here?

30:05.784 --> 30:07.376
Maybe there was
some bad touching?

30:07.452 --> 30:08.646
Not by me.

30:12.390 --> 30:17.623
Look, you can't tell the clinic this.

30:18.797 --> 30:19.991
April's last session,

30:20.065 --> 30:23.694
this guy who used to work here, Mitch
Godel, he asked if he could take it.

30:23.768 --> 30:24.928
He stole her
from the clinic,

30:25.003 --> 30:27.198
and kicked you
back a finder's fee?

30:27.272 --> 30:30.070
Yes. Mitch was popular with the ladies.

30:30.142 --> 30:32.975
He could make them feel good
about their bodies, no matter what.

30:33.044 --> 30:39.074
So, what, you told Mitch
about April's vulnerability?

30:39.551 --> 30:42.213
No. I never told him anything about her,

30:42.287 --> 30:44.221
but he seemed to know everything anyway.

30:44.289 --> 30:46.553
Even that she lived
with her grandmother.

30:47.392 --> 30:49.485
Look, I got another session.

30:56.501 --> 30:59.664
Sounds like Mitch was making book
on April even before he met her.

31:01.806 --> 31:03.797
Well, maybe he had a
source close to home.

31:07.712 --> 31:12.979
Eleanor's autopsy, she had
two compressed vertebrae,

31:14.286 --> 31:16.015
probably from
a car accident.

31:18.456 --> 31:20.253
The injuries were
at least a year old.

31:20.325 --> 31:22.759
Whiplash.
You get massage for that.

31:25.330 --> 31:27.730
Eleanor was treated at
the clinic two years ago.

31:27.799 --> 31:30.324
They think she was one of the
patients Mitch cherry-picked.

31:30.402 --> 31:33.371
And from her, he heard all
about her lovelorn granddaughter.

31:34.372 --> 31:37.864
Enough to know that April
was neglected and needy.

31:37.943 --> 31:41.208
He seduced her, talked her
into this kidnapping scheme...

31:41.279 --> 31:44.908
Leaving out the part about killing
her and Eleanor, and everybody else.

31:44.983 --> 31:47.975
Delgado's probably lying
in a ditch somewhere.

31:48.220 --> 31:51.519
Then April's escape created
a substantial problem for him.

31:51.590 --> 31:53.455
She could turn on him. The question is,

31:53.525 --> 31:55.322
why didn't he kill her right then?

31:55.393 --> 31:58.521
Probably because he had too
many other things to do first.

31:58.597 --> 32:00.929
He had to kill the three musketeers,

32:00.999 --> 32:03.559
and make it look like Delgado
got away with the gold.

32:04.169 --> 32:07.627
Once she escaped, she must've
run right into his arms.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.768
He used her to create
an alibi for himself.

32:11.843 --> 32:13.140
The drug store receipt.

32:13.211 --> 32:16.044
Well, that alone isn't
enough to clear Mitch

32:16.114 --> 32:18.207
if April ever
implicated him.

32:21.086 --> 32:26.388
The pack of ketchup. You know, he
planted it to make himself a suspect.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.892
Nice guys that we are,
we cleared him.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.655
We thought Delgado
framed him.

32:30.729 --> 32:32.822
And now it's a part of
police record.

32:32.897 --> 32:35.263
That and the fact that Mr.
Delgado is unaccounted for

32:35.333 --> 32:37.927
is enough to create a reasonable doubt.

32:38.870 --> 32:40.770
Mitch hid in plain sight.

32:40.839 --> 32:44.070
If he's as clever as you think, he
probably hid the ransom money well.

32:44.142 --> 32:45.905
He did time for
credit card fraud,

32:45.977 --> 32:49.469
maybe he used one of his old
tricks to move the money around.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.508
Mitch just manufactured credit cards

32:54.586 --> 32:58.454
with legit numbers and used
them to buy lots of stamps.

32:58.890 --> 32:59.879
How'd he get caught?

32:59.958 --> 33:01.823
Airport security.

33:01.893 --> 33:06.330
He had a card-making machine and
100 blank cards in his carry-on.

33:07.832 --> 33:11.563
Thanks for scaring me
straight!"

33:13.605 --> 33:15.539
Let me take a wild guess.
Mitch?

33:16.841 --> 33:19.537
He knew
when he was beat.

33:19.611 --> 33:22.341
This is solid metal, not plastic.

33:23.581 --> 33:26.880
He got a deal on it from a buddy
in Scarsdale who made trophies.

33:30.655 --> 33:31.917
Hide in plain sight.

33:33.958 --> 33:37.155
Well, April and Mitch haven't
been together for almost two weeks.

33:37.228 --> 33:39.753
Must seem like an eternity to April.

33:40.832 --> 33:43.130
I've already helped
you all that I could.

33:43.201 --> 33:44.998
We're concerned
this guy Delgado

33:45.070 --> 33:46.799
could pop up
back in the city.

33:46.871 --> 33:49.237
I don't even know
anything about him.

33:49.307 --> 33:52.003
Witnesses often don't
know what they know.

33:52.077 --> 33:53.738
Sometimes when we're
looking for someone,

33:53.812 --> 33:57.009
we bring people together who
knew him and get them talking.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.449
I don't want to
talk to anybody.

34:00.518 --> 34:01.883
Well, it wouldn't take very long.

34:01.953 --> 34:03.443
This other person
who knows Delgado

34:03.521 --> 34:04.715
works at the VA Hospital.

34:04.789 --> 34:06.586
Maybe we can catch him
before he goes to work.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.824
He's a friend of Delgado's?

34:10.895 --> 34:14.228
An acquaintance. His
name's Godel, Mitch Godel.

34:16.768 --> 34:19.168
Hey, you know,
if you don't want

34:19.237 --> 34:22.103
to talk to any strangers,
we understand.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.842
Detective Eames. I'm just off to work.

34:31.916 --> 34:33.440
You mind if we come in?

34:33.685 --> 34:35.083
I guess not.

34:36.087 --> 34:37.145
Hey.

34:38.922 --> 34:40.686
Hi. I'm Mitch Godel.

34:40.759 --> 34:45.786
This is April Callaway. She's
the young woman who was kidnapped.

34:45.864 --> 34:49.697
Right.
I heard. I'm sorry.

34:50.534 --> 34:53.402
Mitch, we no longer
think Mo left the country.

34:53.471 --> 34:55.335
And that's a problem for Ms. Callaway.

34:55.407 --> 34:58.342
We thought if we brought the two of
you together, you could talk about Mo,

34:58.410 --> 35:01.777
and maybe some detail might
come up that can help us.

35:03.181 --> 35:07.242
Excuse me, but do you
two know each other?

35:07.986 --> 35:11.046
I think I might have worked on you
one time. Hips and knees, right?

35:11.456 --> 35:13.014
Yes.
Small world.

35:14.325 --> 35:16.190
You work at the VA?

35:16.261 --> 35:17.922
Sometimes I freelance
at clinics.

35:20.865 --> 35:22.423
How did you end
up at his clinic?

35:23.501 --> 35:27.870
My grandmother went there for
her neck from her car accident.

35:28.273 --> 35:29.638
You treated
her grandmother, too?

35:29.707 --> 35:31.538
I might have done
a couple of sessions.

35:31.609 --> 35:33.702
So, I don't know what
I can tell you about Mo.

35:33.778 --> 35:36.508
Well, we pulled up
a list of his relatives,

35:36.581 --> 35:39.072
most of them
are in Florida.

35:39.317 --> 35:41.478
Do you mind if I
get a glass of water?

35:41.553 --> 35:42.645
Help yourself.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.154
Maybe one of the names
came up in conversation.

35:45.223 --> 35:47.589
You look like you're thirsty.
Glasses?

35:47.659 --> 35:48.887
Next to the fridge.

35:50.094 --> 35:52.289
He never mentioned
any of these people.

35:53.598 --> 35:55.657
So, April, how did you know
where he kept the glasses?

35:57.068 --> 35:58.558
Been here before?

35:59.304 --> 36:02.137
Okay, I wasn't
going to say anything,

36:02.474 --> 36:05.932
but I gave April a couple of sessions
here, you know, off-the-books.

36:06.010 --> 36:07.341
Mitch,
you should have...

36:07.412 --> 36:10.313
Said something? I know, but
you guys already suspected me

36:10.381 --> 36:12.975
of having something to do
with that kidnapping, so...

36:13.051 --> 36:14.348
Yeah, you know, I'm thinking, Mitch.

36:14.419 --> 36:17.946
Are you sure you didn't say anything
to Mo about working on April?

36:18.022 --> 36:20.786
You know, it could have given
him the idea about the kidnapping.

36:22.093 --> 36:26.996
Yeah, I might've told
him that I had a client

36:27.599 --> 36:30.625
who was a part of a
famous atheist family.

36:30.702 --> 36:33.193
Well, Mo probably figured
"famous" meant "loaded. "

36:34.873 --> 36:38.775
But he knew too much about
the Federation's finances.

36:39.944 --> 36:42.572
No, it must have
been inside help.

36:47.051 --> 36:48.040
God.

36:48.620 --> 36:50.645
I'm getting out of shape.

36:51.055 --> 36:55.287
These things, they feel like
they weigh more than 10 pounds.

36:58.563 --> 37:02.590
You know, April, a lot
of people thought that

37:03.768 --> 37:07.704
your Uncle Wayne was going
to do the show with Eleanor.

37:10.275 --> 37:14.405
But, last minute, you
insisted on replacing him.

37:14.712 --> 37:16.907
It turns out your dad
never called the station

37:16.981 --> 37:18.915
to say he was
stuck in traffic.

37:19.217 --> 37:21.515
But that's not
what Grandma told me.

37:21.586 --> 37:25.579
You know, the inside
source, April, it's you.

37:27.725 --> 37:30.125
Mo, he got his hooks in you.

37:30.828 --> 37:31.852
No!

37:31.930 --> 37:34.057
He told you that your
family didn't respect you,

37:34.132 --> 37:35.156
they took you for granted.

37:35.233 --> 37:36.723
No, no.

37:36.801 --> 37:38.359
Mo said you could
have your own life,

37:38.436 --> 37:40.666
with him and
half a million bucks.

37:40.738 --> 37:42.205
Mitch, please, tell them.

37:44.309 --> 37:45.799
Tell them what?

37:48.179 --> 37:52.343
Oh, I get it. Now you're
trying to set me up here.

37:53.751 --> 37:55.013
Now, I know you're hurt,

37:55.086 --> 37:59.182
but she got the wrong
idea from the beginning.

37:59.490 --> 38:02.721
Sometimes that happens, on account
of all the touching involved.

38:02.794 --> 38:05.524
She had this whole fantasy
about us.

38:05.964 --> 38:08.091
You two were romantically involved?

38:08.166 --> 38:10.600
No, come on.
What, are you kidding?

38:11.402 --> 38:14.462
I tried to be a gentleman.
I let her down easy.

38:14.539 --> 38:18.532
But she kept calling. And
now she's implicating me.

38:19.077 --> 38:20.874
This is how
she pays me back.

38:20.945 --> 38:23.379
But you know I didn't
have nothing to do with it.

38:23.448 --> 38:25.916
Is that what this is all
about, April? Payback?

38:27.652 --> 38:29.620
You know, pay back your
dad for abandoning you,

38:30.254 --> 38:33.883
pay back your grandmother
for driving him away,

38:33.958 --> 38:36.859
pay back Mitch
for rejecting you?

38:39.731 --> 38:41.961
I wasn't out
to hurt anyone.

38:44.402 --> 38:47.769
I told Mitch what I was going to
do, but he wanted no part of it.

38:49.173 --> 38:52.438
But then everything started
to go wrong, and I got scared.

38:52.510 --> 38:56.708
So, I escaped. I didn't know
what to do, so I called Mitch.

38:57.882 --> 39:00.578
He did not have to
help me, but he did.

39:01.586 --> 39:04.020
And he went to the motel
room to save Grandma,

39:04.088 --> 39:06.556
but he got there too late.

39:07.692 --> 39:10.490
And everybody was dead, and
Mo had run off with the money.

39:11.663 --> 39:13.187
You really must
have magic fingers,

39:13.264 --> 39:15.892
if she's willing to
take the rap for you.

39:15.967 --> 39:18.765
All he's done is
protect me from Mo.

39:20.405 --> 39:21.963
He's been kind to me.

39:23.107 --> 39:24.267
There you go.

39:24.342 --> 39:26.071
April, come on,

39:26.144 --> 39:29.307
if you think this guy
harbors any feelings for you

39:29.847 --> 39:33.544
other than contempt,
you're wrong.

39:34.686 --> 39:38.281
When the two of you met, it wasn't fate.

39:38.623 --> 39:40.090
He targeted you.

39:40.158 --> 39:41.921
He learned all about you
from Eleanor.

39:41.993 --> 39:44.154
He knew
the foundation had money.

39:44.896 --> 39:47.956
He paid off that other
masseur to take your session,

39:48.032 --> 39:49.465
so he could
manipulate you.

39:49.534 --> 39:50.933
He did not.

39:51.602 --> 39:54.628
He encouraged me to
stand up for myself.

39:55.139 --> 39:59.098
Grandma and Uncle Wayne
were taking advantage of me,

39:59.177 --> 40:00.974
hiding things from me.

40:01.045 --> 40:03.878
And Mitch told you that?
Now, how would he know?

40:06.117 --> 40:07.914
When he was massaging Grandma last year,

40:07.985 --> 40:10.112
she was always
on her cell phone,

40:10.188 --> 40:12.213
like he wasn't even there.

40:12.657 --> 40:15.148
Mitch heard her
transfer $100,000

40:15.226 --> 40:17.091
into an account at
the New Amsterdam Bank.

40:17.161 --> 40:20.028
You know, if it wasn't for
Mitch, I never would have known.

40:20.098 --> 40:24.467
So, he told you that he
overheard this last year?

40:25.169 --> 40:26.227
Yes.

40:26.304 --> 40:29.102
April, that account was
opened just two months ago.

40:32.543 --> 40:33.669
I don't understand.

40:34.212 --> 40:36.146
Well, we're starting to.

40:37.248 --> 40:40.649
Mitch knew about the account because
he was still talking to Eleanor.

40:42.286 --> 40:44.015
Weren't you, Mitch?

40:44.555 --> 40:45.954
You guys are
imagining things.

40:46.023 --> 40:47.456
That $100,000,

40:49.227 --> 40:51.957
that was supposed to
be the ransom money.

40:53.498 --> 40:56.831
Reverend Callaway, he was
supposed to take the fall.

40:58.503 --> 41:01.267
Now, your grandmother lied to
you about your father being late.

41:01.339 --> 41:06.003
It was Eleanor. It was
Eleanor's idea, the kidnapping.

41:07.411 --> 41:09.709
You know, a grab for publicity.

41:11.048 --> 41:14.984
To, you know, become
a lightning rod again.

41:15.086 --> 41:17.554
What do you mean?
Grandma wasn't like that.

41:17.622 --> 41:19.180
Well, what was it
your father said?

41:19.257 --> 41:21.384
That the most dangerous
place in the world

41:21.459 --> 41:24.360
was between Eleanor
Callaway and a camera.

41:24.428 --> 41:28.387
Eleanor remembered Mitch,
the upstanding citizen he was.

41:28.466 --> 41:31.993
She offered him $100,000
to stage her kidnapping.

41:32.370 --> 41:34.565
And Mitch smelled
more money.

41:40.778 --> 41:43.941
See, he used you to
double-cross Eleanor.

41:44.415 --> 41:47.350
I don't believe that.
Mitch...

41:48.419 --> 41:50.853
I would never do
nothing to hurt you.

41:50.922 --> 41:53.482
It was Mo, he was going to kill you.

41:53.858 --> 41:55.723
It was all that money,
made him nuts.

41:55.793 --> 41:59.388
It made him nuts? What? What
happened? He got gold fever?

42:00.131 --> 42:01.564
Is that what happened?
Yeah.

42:01.632 --> 42:02.860
I've seen it
happen to people.

42:02.934 --> 42:04.959
Yeah, to people?
You mean you, Mitch?

42:13.578 --> 42:19.107
You see, April? You see now? It's gold.

42:20.852 --> 42:22.547
Mitch had it all along.

42:24.455 --> 42:28.221
Mo is dead.
Mitch killed everyone.

42:30.761 --> 42:35.255
And the first chance he got,
he was gonna kill you, too.

42:37.468 --> 42:39.299
I thought you loved me.

42:40.204 --> 42:43.662
Come on. You ever
look at yourself?

42:45.109 --> 42:46.133
You...

42:47.445 --> 42:48.707
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:48.779 --> 42:51.577
It's all right, Mitch, don't
worry. We'll protect you.

42:51.649 --> 42:54.345
And, by the way,
you're under arrest.

42:54.418 --> 42:59.117
He said that nobody would
get hurt. You promised me!

42:59.624 --> 43:02.058
I promised her.
You believe this chick?

43:09.634 --> 43:13.900
I understand April being
fooled by him, but Eleanor?

43:15.973 --> 43:19.409
Well, she didn't believe
in heaven and hell,

43:19.477 --> 43:22.503
so how would she know the
devil was massaging her neck?
