WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:02.860
Did something happen on Friday?

00:02.860 --> 00:05.500
I think Jonas was with Ingrid.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.060
Why are you lying to me?
-I'm not lying!

00:10.700 --> 00:13.160
Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me!

00:13.160 --> 00:17.520
Last Friday? Yeah.
Yeah I was with Jonas.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.680
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.300
I'll meet William again soon.
There really can be something between us.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.780
Ingrid's brother is a dealer.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.780
I trust you 100%.

00:44.380 --> 00:49.540
First there's Ring Lord
instead of Lord of the Rings.

00:49.540 --> 00:55.200
Then we have The Lion King.
Taking Lion literally, you can have sex in the woods.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.400
I won't!

00:59.400 --> 01:04.420
Or instead of the Hunger Games,
we'll say the Thirst Games.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.640
The Thirst Games!

01:06.680 --> 01:10.500
Because we drink. And we
don't drink Pepsi Max, if you know what I mean.

01:10.660 --> 01:13.520
No? It's about
Smirnoff Light here.

01:13.720 --> 01:19.720
Did you know Diet Coke won in
the Pepsi Max versus Diet Coke test?

01:19.720 --> 01:23.420
So Pepsi Max really
isn't that great. It isn't!

01:24.340 --> 01:25.300
No!

01:26.560 --> 01:29.060
What are you doing on your plate, Vilde?

01:29.820 --> 01:31.900
I'm just sorting my salad.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.540
I don't think you have to sort it anymore.

01:47.060 --> 01:49.680
When should we talk
about what happened at the Halloween party?

01:51.060 --> 01:53.740
That William and Sara hooked up.
-Who are they?

01:54.540 --> 01:56.020
Were you upset?

01:56.320 --> 02:02.760
No, dear god. It was a hook up party. It was completely
normal to hook up at the party. Everyone hooked up with each other.

02:02.760 --> 02:07.280
Penetrator Henrik hooked up with Frida from 1STE.

02:07.340 --> 02:09.940
Borkis hooked up with Elise from 1STB.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.180
Chris hooked up with someone.
And then there's William and Sara.

02:14.180 --> 02:18.720
Chris, who did you hook up with?
No, not this Chris. Penetrator Chris.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.920
Who did he hook up with?

02:27.300 --> 02:30.620
I don't know. I just
heard he hooked up with someone.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.000
Hello.
-Hi.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.960
What are you doing today?
-Thought I'd go skate.

02:47.180 --> 02:48.780
Can I come? And watch?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.120
Yeah... When did you get into that?

02:52.300 --> 02:53.800
I feel like being with you.

02:57.460 --> 03:00.600
But I have to go now.
We'll talk later.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.620
Love you!
-Yeah, you too.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.460
Question.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.160
Is Isak available?

03:20.080 --> 03:21.560
Yeah. Why?

03:21.560 --> 03:25.060
I felt there was some
electric chemistry going on here.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.060
Some really hot vibes between us.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.200
Seriously.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.460
I see it's going
better with you and Jonas.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.600
Yes.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.380
You don't want to say why?

04:47.920 --> 04:51.500
No, we just talked some stuff out.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.080
I fucked up badly.
-What?

05:10.680 --> 05:12.720
What did you do?

05:16.360 --> 05:17.220
Isak.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.040
If I tell you this, you have
to promise not to say anything to Jonas.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.340
Okay, I promise.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.560
Seriously.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.000
Otherwise you could
ruin our relationship.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.140
I'm not gonna tell anyone, okay?
You can trust me.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.120
What did you do?

05:43.060 --> 05:47.240
You know how I thought
there was something between Ingrid and Jonas?

05:47.620 --> 05:48.540
Hm-hm.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.460
So I asked Ingrid if they
had been together.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.320
And they had been.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.620
Seriously?

05:55.620 --> 05:58.840
But there was a reason for it. It was...

06:00.960 --> 06:02.700
But Ingrid didn't tell me that.

06:04.820 --> 06:08.480
So I was really pissed. And sad.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.140
I hooked up with Chris.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.340
You hooked up with Chris?!

06:24.180 --> 06:26.340
The girl who keeps eye fucking me?

06:26.340 --> 06:27.320
No, no!

06:28.160 --> 06:30.300
Chris from the third year. Christoffer.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.520
So you hooked up with a third year?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.320
Fuck! It's really-

06:45.440 --> 06:48.620
It was just hooking up, right?
Nothing more happened?

06:48.860 --> 06:49.920
No, no.

06:56.740 --> 07:00.840
It would been worse
if it wasn't just hooking up.

07:00.840 --> 07:04.920
If it had meant something to you.
But you were just angry.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.780
Yeah...

07:11.500 --> 07:14.560
It feels shitty not
to tell Jonas.

07:15.780 --> 07:18.020
Honestly, Eva...

07:18.640 --> 07:26.280
If I had a girl who had hooked up
with someone else, I wouldn't want to know.

07:26.520 --> 07:33.060
Things like that fuck up a relationship.
You don't have to tell him if it meant nothing.

07:36.800 --> 07:42.520
And it seems like you're more in love with
him now than you were before, right? Maybe it was a good thing?

07:45.720 --> 07:48.200
It was just a little hook up, right?

07:48.640 --> 07:56.020
It'll be okay, but make sure no one knows.
That it won't come from someone else.

07:56.020 --> 07:58.020
Especially from Chris, right?

07:59.820 --> 08:00.920
It'll be okay.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.520
Thanks.

08:12.260 --> 08:13.340
For what?

08:14.960 --> 08:15.920
You know.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.760
Vilde!

08:27.920 --> 08:28.640
Hi!

08:28.640 --> 08:32.520
I have to ask you something.

08:33.360 --> 08:37.840
Yesterday you said Chris
hooked up with someone at the Halloween party.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.100
What do you know about it?

08:42.100 --> 08:44.420
I just heard he
hooked up with someone.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.320
Okay... Who said that?

08:48.060 --> 08:51.440
Or was it Robin who hooked up with someone?
-Robin?

08:51.440 --> 08:54.840
Now that I think about
it, it was Robin. Chris has a girlfriend.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.580
Yeah, okay.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.340
Do you like him?

09:00.820 --> 09:02.160
Huh? No, no!

09:02.160 --> 09:06.140
Think of how perfect it would be if I'm
together with William, and you're with Chris.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.480
Vilde, seriously?!

09:09.320 --> 09:12.120
It was just a suggestion...

09:12.340 --> 09:17.500
You can't walk around in that
sweater thinking you'll be together with William.

09:17.620 --> 09:18.520
Come here.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.080
You see that girl over there?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.540
She has slept with William.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.440
See her over there?

09:25.920 --> 09:28.840
She has also slept with William.
There comes another one.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.900
There, and up there.

09:34.500 --> 09:39.340
You can't know that all those girls slept
with William! There's a lot of guys on their bus.

09:39.340 --> 09:42.080
Vilde, it's marked on the sweater.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.880
The one you've slept
with is marked in red.

09:45.260 --> 09:49.620
You're walking around like some
living trophy now. You have to forget William!

09:50.420 --> 09:54.100
Give him back the sweater,
and take back your integrity!

09:56.200 --> 09:58.420
He's the loser, not you.

10:03.480 --> 10:10.960
You need to know that if a guy doesn't like you
it's not you there's something wrong with. It's him.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.040
But how do you think like that?

10:18.100 --> 10:21.100
I keep thinking it's
me there's something wrong with.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.420
Hi.
Hello.

11:18.580 --> 11:19.800
What are you doing here?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.580
What do you mean by that?

11:25.000 --> 11:25.680
Hi.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.300
Hello.
-Are you okay?

11:28.520 --> 11:32.340
Yeah, I'm fine. What about you?
-Good. I was reading.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.960
Yeah, what?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.280
Elle.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.360
Are you gonna get that, or?

11:42.040 --> 11:42.800
Yeah!

11:46.620 --> 11:47.580
Hallo?

11:47.760 --> 11:50.340
You're such a stalker!

11:51.060 --> 11:56.020
Hi, mom! I can't talk
right now. Someone's visiting.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.840
Mom?! What kind of
sick game are you playing?

12:00.140 --> 12:01.640
I'll call you afterwards, okay?

12:02.460 --> 12:05.840
Okay, my girl! We'll call afterwards.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.600
Okay, bye!
-Wait, one more thing.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.780
Have you done your homework?
-Bye!

12:15.640 --> 12:18.240
Was that your mom?
-Yeah!

12:21.080 --> 12:22.760
"Someone's visiting"?!

12:22.800 --> 12:25.240
<i>[It's REALLY important that you shut up
about what happened on Halloween, okay?]</i>

12:25.280 --> 12:27.260
Have you still not told her we're together?

12:28.460 --> 12:36.140
You know what? You had the chance to meet my
mom but you chose to smoke marijuana with Ingrid's brother.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.300
What?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.580
It's sweet that you call it marijuana.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.580
<i>[I'll keep my mouth shut. No worries.]</i>

12:43.020 --> 12:45.560
What's sweet about it? That's what it's called.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.000
Yeah.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.620
But..
-But?

12:49.620 --> 12:51.900
Only old people say it.

12:52.360 --> 12:57.100
Old people?! I'm a little
older than you. Little smarter.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.680
What do you call drugs?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.200
Drugs...

13:01.460 --> 13:05.040
I don't know. We just
call it greens or something.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.000
But it's the same.
And it's not good for you.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.800
You're really far away now. Do you see me?

13:12.980 --> 13:15.240
I'm perfectly fine.

13:15.860 --> 13:19.800
Then you're an alcoholic.
You've tried drinking alcohol.

13:19.960 --> 13:24.680
You can't compare those!
-That's what you're saying!

13:24.800 --> 13:29.020
Okay, great. So I'm a junkie
for trying it sometimes. -Sometimes?!

13:29.400 --> 13:32.060
How many times?
-I don't know.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.600
Are you awake all night?
-No.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.200
Can't you stop for my sake?

13:46.540 --> 13:48.380
I can do everything for your sake.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.440
Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:15.860 --> 14:19.400
You can't buy pink uggs!
-Uggs in general.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.600
Why not?
-They're super comfortable, though.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.140
They look insanely ugly.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.540
I've decided on what
I'm going to say to William.

14:29.060 --> 14:29.960
Say?

14:30.220 --> 14:32.900
What are you talking about?
-My integrity.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.000
You don't have any. Next subject.

14:36.180 --> 14:37.520
What are you gonna say?

14:37.660 --> 14:41.360
I will say that I will not be
treated like this.

14:41.420 --> 14:41.900
Huh?

14:41.940 --> 14:44.340
And then, I'll return the sweater.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.080
You can't do that.
-Why not?

14:46.200 --> 14:49.880
We're finally in with the Penetrator guys,
and now you're going to fuck everything up?

14:49.920 --> 14:54.000
Says you, who ruined things for
all first years the first time we were invited to a party.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.900
Sana, it's good that Vilde will explain
to William that she will not be treated like crap.

15:00.920 --> 15:05.540
She can't tell him! It won't work.
It's better to be completely cool.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.280
It's possible to be cool and speak up.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.100
There he is.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.200
You're going to say it now?!

15:13.540 --> 15:14.260
Yes.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.940
He's with his friends.
-I don't give a shit who he's with!

15:25.600 --> 15:27.560
Hi.
-Hi?

15:27.720 --> 15:32.960
If you thought I would walk around like
some living trophy, you're terribly wrong.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.660
Don't play dumb!
You know what I mean.

15:36.740 --> 15:38.300
What's your name again?

15:40.220 --> 15:41.360
Vilde.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.800
Okay, Vilde. Take a deep breath.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.160
I think there's a
small miscommunication here.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.940
I'm sure it's my fault.

15:55.460 --> 15:58.880
If you think I look
at you like some trophy, you're wrong.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.840
Because you're not good enough.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.760
What an awesome guy you are!

16:17.860 --> 16:18.820
Who are you?

16:18.920 --> 16:26.240
What happened that made
you have such an inferiority complex...

16:26.300 --> 16:31.140
... that you have to piss on the feelings of
a first year girl to feel cool?

16:31.560 --> 16:34.340
Were you never validated as a child, or?

16:34.640 --> 16:37.280
Did mommy never compliment your drawings?

16:37.600 --> 16:42.480
Or did daddy never come to
any of your graduations?

16:43.120 --> 16:46.820
You didn't have hair on your
dick in 7th grade and you were bullied for it?

16:47.600 --> 16:52.200
Anyway, you have to seriously
get over it and start behaving like a human.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.200
Stop walking around like a fucking cliche.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.280
I have to go to Norwegian.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.220
No...
-I have to!

17:30.780 --> 17:35.220
But seriously, I really have to go.
I've been late way too many times.

17:42.700 --> 17:43.820
We'll talk!

17:50.440 --> 17:53.300
Fucking hell, you
were so awesome yesterday.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.160
Yeah, you were legendary.

17:56.580 --> 18:00.100
Are you doing okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Completely over William.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.480
Good.

18:01.800 --> 18:07.320
Anyway, nobody cares about what happened. Everyone's
talking about that rumor that's going around about Chris.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.740
What rumor about Chris?

18:12.340 --> 18:17.260
Chris hooked up with someone at the Halloween party,
and his girl found out. She went psycho!

18:17.260 --> 18:19.300
But you said it wasn't Chris!

18:19.300 --> 18:22.100
Chris hooked up with
someone at the party. I saw it.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.640
You saw it?

18:23.760 --> 18:26.580
On the staircase.
-Staircase?!

19:12.740 --> 19:14.440
You fucking whore!
