WEBVTT

00:13.714 --> 00:14.315
(laughing)

00:16.684 --> 00:17.585
Dogboy!

00:23.757 --> 00:26.260
* I don't need anyone

00:26.294 --> 00:29.263
* Don't need no mom and dad

00:29.297 --> 00:29.930
Dogboy!

00:29.963 --> 00:31.699
*Don't need pretty face

00:31.732 --> 00:32.833
*Don't need no human race

00:32.866 --> 00:34.535
(barking)

00:34.568 --> 00:36.404
* I got some news for you

00:36.437 --> 00:37.405
(barking)

00:37.438 --> 00:39.107
It's okay. You're free.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.209
* I got my devil machine

00:41.242 --> 00:42.676
We are freeing
these innocent beings

00:42.710 --> 00:44.378
from the depths of hell.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.448
* Sonic reducer,
ain't no loser *

00:49.317 --> 00:52.620
* Got my sonic reducer,
ain't no loser *

00:54.455 --> 00:55.756
MAN: Come on, man. We got to
hurry.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.591
Wait till all the animals
are out of the building

00:57.625 --> 01:00.194
before we set these off.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.664
(barking)

01:04.632 --> 01:06.267
Come on, let's go.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.668
Let's go. Get out. Come on.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.270
*People out on the streets

01:09.303 --> 01:09.970
MAN: Come on!

01:10.003 --> 01:10.838
*They don't know who I am

01:10.871 --> 01:11.572
(barking)

01:11.605 --> 01:14.208
* I watch them from my room

01:14.242 --> 01:16.677
* They all just pass me by

01:16.710 --> 01:18.812
* But I'm not just anyone

01:18.846 --> 01:20.148
That's it. They're free.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.515
*Said I'm not just anyone

01:21.549 --> 01:24.152
* I got my devil machine

01:24.185 --> 01:25.519
*Got my electronic dream

01:25.553 --> 01:27.521
It's me. What's the matter?
Want to go?

01:27.555 --> 01:28.456
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

01:28.489 --> 01:29.190
Come on!

01:29.223 --> 01:30.224
*Sonic reducer, ain't no loser

01:37.498 --> 01:38.832
These animals
are suffering abuse.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.268
They have no freedom,

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
which is their basic right
as living beings.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.579
We're releasing
these healthy animals

01:51.612 --> 01:54.215
before the professors
can inject them with disease

01:54.248 --> 01:56.217
and dope them up with drugs.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.418
* Then I'll be ten feet tall

01:57.451 --> 02:00.854
* And you'll be nothing at all

02:00.888 --> 02:02.756
* I got my devil machine

02:02.790 --> 02:04.425
* I got my electronic dream

02:04.458 --> 02:06.460
Rat guillotine.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.562
Destroy it, man.
Damage the misery machine.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.600
* Sonic reducer,
ain't no loser *

02:12.633 --> 02:14.602
What the hell are you
doing in here?!

02:14.635 --> 02:16.404
We demand you stop
torturing living beings.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.705
You don't know
what you're doing.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.473
Are you insane?!

02:21.609 --> 02:22.376
(glass breaking)

02:22.410 --> 02:23.511
*Sonic reducer

02:23.544 --> 02:24.545
(body thuds on floor)

02:24.578 --> 02:25.513
*Sonic reducer.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.281
(squeaking)

02:30.451 --> 02:32.253
Hey, did you shuffle
these cards enough?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.421
My hand is sucky.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.488
(scoffs)
Blame the dealer.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.856
Classic.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.192
AMITA:
Okay.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.193
I'm in for five.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.962
Me, too. How many?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.297
ALAN:
Okay, get it while

02:43.331 --> 02:44.432
it's still pizza.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.533
- Three.
- Make this the last hand.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.734
We have to eat.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.436
LARRY: Nikki makes a critical
point there.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.304
Persi Diaconis
of Stanford

02:50.338 --> 02:52.506
proved that a minimum
of five shuffles are required

02:52.540 --> 02:54.242
for a deck
to become random.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.476
Of course,
that's random

02:55.509 --> 02:57.311
in the sense
of variation distance

02:57.345 --> 02:59.680
described by Markov chain
mixing time,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.315
but I suppose

03:01.349 --> 03:03.684
in this room, seven shuffles
are sufficient FAPP.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.686
FAPP?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.588
Yeah.
For all practical purposes.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.257
ALAN: Well, for all practical
purposes,

03:09.290 --> 03:10.591
where are Don and Charlie
with the beer?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.626
I don't know.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.895
I'll bet another five.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.464
Well, that's a sizable pot.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.432
Yeah, all right.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.533
I'll see you five.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.270
Yeah. I'll raise you ten.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.274
Thought you had a bad hand.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.010
High stakes.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.312
I'll call.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.646
Well, it's gonna be like that,

03:32.680 --> 03:33.914
you'd better deal me in.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.449
Well played, Betancourt.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.852
What do you mean?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.588
Yeah.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.556
Three queens.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.524
ALAN:
Whoa!

03:43.557 --> 03:45.559
You know, that little trick
only works once.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.694
(laughs)

03:46.727 --> 03:47.861
(phone whistles tune)

03:47.895 --> 03:49.297
CHARLIE:
Hey!

03:49.330 --> 03:50.864
- Who's thirsty?
- ALAN: Hey, finally, huh?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.500
What's going on? Who's winning?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.767
ALAN:
Ah, it's over.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.303
We're teaching Nikki
how to play.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.470
DON:
Yeah, all right.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.272
I'll get in
on some of that. Beer?

03:58.306 --> 03:59.740
Oh, come on. Pizza, pizza.
I made it.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.642
DON: All right, I'll have a
slice.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.345
That was Lorna Ludlow.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.648
Nelson Horowitz has just
been attacked in his lab.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.717
- What?
- Who's that?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.720
He's a biology professor
at CalSci.

04:12.753 --> 04:17.458
Lawrence, I can't
believe this.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.594
Dr. Lorna Ludlow,
this is Don and Charles Eppes.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.363
Lorna's an immunologist
working on Avian Flu.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.665
Yeah. I've seen you across
the room at faculty meetings.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.634
So, you work
in this building?

04:26.667 --> 04:29.570
I do. I'm the first name
on the emergency call list.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.773
A janitor found poor Nelson,
and I came right away.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.642
They've not let me
into his lab,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.044
but I've seen all
the rest of the damage.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.746
What did the attackers do

04:38.779 --> 04:40.013
besides spray-painting
the walls?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.383
LORNA:
Experimental animals

04:42.416 --> 04:45.519
from all the labs on this floor
have been taken or released.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.621
It's a...
It's a devastating blow.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.457
The loss of our animals
is going

04:49.490 --> 04:50.658
to affect our work for years.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.874
(gasps)

05:06.907 --> 05:08.676
Can't we... Can't we get him out
of there?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.514
(camera shutter clicks)

05:14.582 --> 05:16.784
Oh. Nelson.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.952
(gasps)
Oh, no...

05:20.153 --> 05:22.656
(camera shutter clicks)

05:35.769 --> 05:37.738
Professor Nelson
David Horowitz.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.408
Unfortunately, he decided
to work late last night.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.843
Researching the effects
of, uh, stress and PTSD on rats,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.144
trying to find a treatment

05:44.177 --> 05:46.647
for trauma victims
and war veterans.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.115
LIZ: He was immobilized with a
bright light

05:48.148 --> 05:50.818
in his eyes-- exactly
what he did to the rats.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
DAVID: But the coroner only
found superficial wounds

05:52.886 --> 05:53.987
on his body,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.823
so, we think he died of
a heart attack or stroke after

05:55.856 --> 05:56.924
being left in the cage.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.659
Well, he died
during a crime, so...

05:58.692 --> 05:59.660
It-it's murder.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.495
Well, whoever did this
doesn't know he's dead,

06:01.529 --> 06:03.564
so we should probably
try to keep it that way.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.633
If Horowitz was targeted
for his work with animals,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.568
it's not only murder;
it's domestic terrorism.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.604
They also found
an unignited incendiary device

06:10.638 --> 06:11.739
in one of the labs--

06:11.772 --> 06:13.173
a gasoline-filled
plastic milk jug.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.341
LIZ:
I'd guess

06:14.374 --> 06:17.411
the attackers were surprised
by the professor and fled

06:17.445 --> 06:19.046
before they
could set it off.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.814
Or they found a better statement
to make.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.650
NIKKI:
Instructions

06:22.683 --> 06:24.485
on making one
of these little gadgets--

06:24.518 --> 06:27.621
on a Web site
for Animal Rights Rebels.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.922
ARR.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.658
DAVID: Militant group. Uh, they
believe

06:30.691 --> 06:31.959
in animals and arson.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.226
Call themselves ecoterrorists.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.430
They encourage people to release
animals and destroy property.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.966
Underground, anonymous,
worldwide.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.001
Let's see if there's
a local group or something.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.169
No chapters, no cells.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.604
People log on to the ARR

06:43.637 --> 06:45.439
Web site, and they act
on their own.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.807
Can you take that down, please?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.841
He was a colleague.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.810
Come here. Take
a walk with me.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.579
No, it's not necessary.
I'm sorry.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.614
I know I seem
a bit emotional. Um,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.449
I have a very clear plan
on how to help.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.718
Well, Charlie, I need
some coffee. Come on.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.588
Check around, see if anyone
has taken credit, all right?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.457
I'm okay.
I'll all right.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.526
All right, good.
So, what's your plan?

07:05.559 --> 07:07.695
I want to implant
a hidden program

07:07.728 --> 07:09.597
on Web servers
where animal activists meet up.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.532
And we capture relevant data,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.701
like references
to CalSci's animal research,

07:13.734 --> 07:16.103
or finding homes for dogs
that have been released

07:16.136 --> 07:18.171
from labs, or bragging
about caging a man.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.372
What are you
going to do,

07:19.406 --> 07:22.175
eavesdrop on every one of
these groups that's on the Net?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.577
Well, I'm adapting
a new program.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.745
It's called PIR--

07:24.778 --> 07:26.246
Private Information Retrieval.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.181
It's an N-gram analysis.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.750
It's like a keyword
search on steroids.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.951
Mm-hmm.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.721
The pertinent part is something
called oblivious transfer.

07:33.754 --> 07:37.758
So, say I'm looking
for a rare vinyl LP.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.794
A mistaken release
of Bob Dylan's second album,

07:40.828 --> 07:42.262
which has four extra songs

07:42.295 --> 07:45.733
deleted from all other pressings
for being too controversial.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.602
Now, only 30 copies
of this thing exist.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.571
I want the record,
but I don't want

07:50.604 --> 07:52.506
to alert anyone
to its great value,

07:52.540 --> 07:55.609
so I hire secret shoppers
to go to every record store

07:55.643 --> 07:57.277
and buy up every record
they can find.

07:57.310 --> 08:01.682
Then I listen to each one to see
which one has the extra songs.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.084
The secret shoppers don't know
why I want the album;

08:04.117 --> 08:06.186
the stores don't know
that I've been trawling

08:06.219 --> 08:08.021
for a valuable part
of their collection;

08:08.055 --> 08:10.591
and I don't know anything
about their inventory

08:10.624 --> 08:12.693
except precisely
what I'm looking for.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.728
So, we're all oblivious
to each other's information

08:14.762 --> 08:17.130
with one very narrow exception.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.601
One of the rarest records
of all time.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.703
I can only see data
that meets my criteria.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.503
Everything else remains private.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.305
So, the person
who killed Nelson

08:25.338 --> 08:26.807
will never know
we observed him.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.008
Is that legal?

08:28.041 --> 08:29.577
Uh, it's not illegal.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.679
The technology's ahead
of the law.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.014
All right, well,
I'll get working on a warrant.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.684
How well did you know this guy?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.852
We were on a committee together
a few years ago.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.988
He was a funny guy.
He was really funny.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.156
Kind of reminded me of Dad
a little bit.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.658
I'm okay.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.293
You know,
it's just really weird.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.729
My campus is supposed
to be an ivory tower,

08:48.762 --> 08:51.164
but we keep getting invaded
by the outside world.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.570
My organization doesn't support
criminal attacks.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.771
We do not

08:57.805 --> 09:00.641
condone violence against any
animal, human or non-human.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.775
Okay, so who does?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.076
Nobody.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.779
In over 20 years, no one
has been injured or killed

09:05.813 --> 09:06.747
by animal rights people.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.981
Until last night.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.784
This incident has Animal Rights
Rebels written all over it.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.152
(sighs)

09:12.185 --> 09:13.687
They're radical.
They're underground.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.088
They're not us.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.123
LIZ:
Come on.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.325
You must know who's involved
with them locally.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.093
- Give us a name.
- I can't do that.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.129
I don't know who attacked
the university last night.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.230
That's not what
we're asking.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.633
We just want to know
where the local extremists are.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.935
But I'll tell you whoever
did this is an amateur.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.103
If they were really serious
about helping animals,

09:30.137 --> 09:31.772
they'd target factory farms.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.807
That's where the majority
of animals are being tortured.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.943
LIZ: Where do the amateurs hang
out?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.778
DAVID:
Come on.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.713
They already
killed someone,

09:39.747 --> 09:41.715
and they are hurting
your cause.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.784
(sighs)

09:46.319 --> 09:49.890
There's an Internet cafГ©
on Allen Boulevard in Altadena.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.692
Thank you.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.026
Yeah.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.763
Nelson was close
to a new protocol

09:55.796 --> 09:57.364
for posttraumatic
stress syndrome.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.498
Last January,

09:58.531 --> 10:01.001
more active duty soldiers
in Iraq committed suicide

10:01.034 --> 10:02.302
than died in combat.

10:02.335 --> 10:05.773
Now, if Nelson's PTSD work
could prevent a suicide,

10:05.806 --> 10:08.742
is that worth the lives
of 500 rats?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.210
Other researchers

10:10.243 --> 10:13.781
who lost their animals
last night were working on cures

10:13.814 --> 10:16.850
for HIV, malaria,
coronary disease.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.919
And it doesn't
only impact them.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.288
An attack like this would
have a chilling effect

10:21.321 --> 10:22.823
on many researchers.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.925
Well, we need
to figure out bird flu

10:24.958 --> 10:26.293
before it kills
40 million people.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.295
And who's going
to choose to do that

10:28.328 --> 10:30.764
if they risk being murdered
in their own labs?

10:30.798 --> 10:32.900
Lorna, I am concerned
that your name

10:32.933 --> 10:34.902
is listed on the
ARR Web site.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.236
Yeah, they
protested twice

10:36.269 --> 10:37.771
outside my apartment
last year,

10:37.805 --> 10:40.808
screaming, "Lorna Ludlow
tortures animals."

10:40.841 --> 10:42.810
They cracked
the windshield of my car.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.944
I had to move.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.179
You track birds;
you don't kill them.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.749
Nuances are lost
on these people.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.024
Hey, get me a...
mochaccino.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.693
Bathroom in back?

11:05.766 --> 11:08.435
Uh, one latte,
one mochaccino.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.903
Soy milk okay?

11:09.937 --> 11:11.805
We don't use
animal products here.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.206
Sure.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.345
NIKKI: Do you need a password

11:18.378 --> 11:20.280
- to use your Wi-Fi?
- Veganbeat.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.381
One word.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.783
(beeping)

11:42.870 --> 11:45.405
The funny thing is, I...

11:45.438 --> 11:48.842
I don't know where I stand.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.377
I'm pro-research,

11:50.410 --> 11:53.480
but I'm also pro-animal.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.816
Rats show empathy
for another rat in pain.

11:55.849 --> 11:56.850
They're social.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.018
They learn.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.519
Some wild rodents
who mate for life

11:59.552 --> 12:01.955
feel grief when they're
separated from their partner.

12:01.989 --> 12:05.025
Now, knowing all this,
is it still okay

12:05.058 --> 12:08.996
to use them as supplies in a lab
in order to save a human life?

12:09.029 --> 12:13.133
I won't presume to answer
the unanswerable, but...

12:13.166 --> 12:16.937
you know, I really admire you
for your brave,

12:16.970 --> 12:18.939
questioning mind.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.847
Why is the FBI
keeping Nelson's death a secret?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.816
I really don't know.

12:28.849 --> 12:32.786
Assumed it was in order to catch
the culprits more quickly.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.389
It's strange...

12:36.423 --> 12:38.792
for the school not to know yet.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.460
Well, over time,
I have come

12:40.493 --> 12:43.230
to rely on the FBI's instincts.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.834
Distrust my own, I suppose.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.850
Hey.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.851
See this?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.953
- BARISTA: Yeah, I heard.
- MAN: You going?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.554
I'm working.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.022
Too bad.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.023
Latte.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.892
Mochaccino.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.093
Where is he going?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.062
Excuse me?

13:15.095 --> 13:16.296
It sounded like something cool
was happening.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.530
I'm just, uh...

13:17.564 --> 13:18.999
(chuckles) Really?

13:19.032 --> 13:21.334
He's like 17.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.038
Busted.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.948
MAN (over radio):
South hall is secure.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.286
It's odd having

13:39.319 --> 13:40.587
so much security
here at school.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.621
I know.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.956
It will calm down again soon.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.191
All right, I've
got three more

13:44.224 --> 13:45.458
Web sites where
I can implant

13:45.492 --> 13:47.394
- Private Information Retrieval.
- We're already

13:47.427 --> 13:48.962
getting a lot
of alerts, Charlie.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.264
From Animal Rights Rebels?

13:51.298 --> 13:54.634
No, we're getting hits on these
innocuous message boards.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.903
That's weird.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.137
Someone just posted

13:57.170 --> 13:58.538
a video with "CalSci"
in the title.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.542
(dogs barking)

14:02.575 --> 14:06.346
We are freeing these innocent
beings from the depths of hell.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.882
These animals
are suffering abuse.

14:08.916 --> 14:09.883
They have no freedom,

14:09.917 --> 14:12.052
which is their basic right
as living beings.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.154
NELSON: What the hell are you
doing in here?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.890
MAN: We demand you stop
torturing living beings.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.926
See if you can find out
who posted that.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.460
I'm going
to call Don.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.097
(commotion outside)

14:24.131 --> 14:25.032
What is that?

14:25.065 --> 14:27.134
Hey, listen--
so someone posted a video

14:27.167 --> 14:28.168
of the attack
online.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.938
Charlie, there's something
going on out there.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.540
Hold on.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.675
Backup needed
at the southwest courtyard.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.277
(people squawking, whooping)

14:37.310 --> 14:38.411
Oh, my God.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.581
(squawking, whooping)

14:41.614 --> 14:43.416
(cackling)

14:43.450 --> 14:45.986
(clamoring)

14:46.019 --> 14:47.520
- Is this a prank?
- I don't know.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.422
- It could be... or not.
- Hey, listen.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.690
There's a crowd of
people down here.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.692
They're swarming the
biology building.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.095
All right, I'll
call you back.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.396
What is this? What's going on?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.398
MAN (over bullhorn):
Animal liberation!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.167
Animal liberation!
Free the animals!

15:00.200 --> 15:02.002
- Look, this is weird, Charlie.
- There's Larry.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.971
Lock the building.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.605
They're not actually
trying to get in.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.407
(hooting)

15:11.678 --> 15:14.581
(explosion, glass shattering)

15:14.614 --> 15:16.483
(screaming)

15:18.185 --> 15:19.486
- It's okay. You all right?
- Yeah.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.137
(overlapping chatter)

15:37.170 --> 15:39.139
MAN: Make sure we check the
structure...

15:39.172 --> 15:40.273
outside the door.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.641
(sirens blaring)

15:41.674 --> 15:44.277
AMITA:
This was a flash mob.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.379
Yeah, a flash mob
used as a decoy

15:46.413 --> 15:48.448
while someone set fire
to one of the labs.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.350
Did you see anyone
come out of the building?

15:50.383 --> 15:51.384
They're long gone.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.452
You guys all right?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.087
(sighs with relief)

15:55.522 --> 15:57.590
OFFICER:
Sir, apprehended one of them.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
Hey, where do I know you from?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.605
James Arthur, 19,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.241
unemployed.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.608
I'm a student
part-time.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.576
Where?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.379
I'm sitting out a semester.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.480
You're a dropout bum.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.349
Where were you two nights ago?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.352
Hanging out.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.089
We're freeing
these innocent beings...

16:29.122 --> 16:30.523
- Is that you?
- No.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.758
Well, it looks like you.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.526
Same ski mask you
had on last night.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.761
Hey, that could be anybody.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.263
Last night, it was a joke.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.397
It was a flash mob.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.398
And what is that exactly?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.033
A mob of people come together.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.468
They do something weird,
then they disappear.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.402
You organize it?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.537
You know, so someone
could firebomb a lab

16:44.571 --> 16:46.406
while the rest of you
distract campus security?

16:46.439 --> 16:47.474
No way.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.509
No, I saw it on a message board.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.444
- It was just something to do.
- Really?

16:51.478 --> 16:54.481
Yeah, yeah,
on an L.A. vegan forum.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.383
Check it out.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.352
I didn't post it.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.125
Were you at the
cafГ© yesterday?

17:05.158 --> 17:07.060
Sit tight.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.466
NIKKI: Hey, you hearing what I'm
hearing?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.202
Yeah, a flash mob on
a message board.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.002
Yeah.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.737
I'll get online
and check it out.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.239
The geniuses are already on it.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.842
So, someone used
this flash mob as a decoy.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.411
Any idea who?

17:24.444 --> 17:25.645
Well, the screen name
for the person

17:25.678 --> 17:27.480
that posted the notice
is DogBoy88.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.715
Yeah, we traced the server back

17:28.748 --> 17:30.350
to a computer
at the VeganBeat CafГ©.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.252
CHARLIE: Right, but we've
rewritten our filters

17:32.285 --> 17:33.653
for the PIR program.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.522
The Dylan thing you
were telling me about.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.623
That's right.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.092
We tracked DogBoy88
through idiosyncratic phrases

17:39.126 --> 17:39.959
in his e-mail
messages.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.395
Comparing his writing
to the other 231

17:42.429 --> 17:44.531
relevant screen names
we've gathered.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.765
CHARLIE: People have habits of
speech

17:45.798 --> 17:47.767
and writing
that they're unaware of.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.570
Charlie, one screen name
from our list, MacroJL,

17:50.603 --> 17:52.405
is never online
at the same time

17:52.439 --> 17:53.540
as DogBoy88.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.207
All right, well,
scroll down.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.677
CHARLIE: Yeah, MacroJL logs in

17:57.710 --> 18:00.580
within seconds
of DogBoy88 logging off.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.714
It's like Superman
and Clark Kent.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.749
Never at the same place

18:02.782 --> 18:04.384
at the same time.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.485
Same person.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.753
How definite you think it is?

18:06.786 --> 18:07.820
We can work out
some probabilities.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.289
DogBoy88

18:09.322 --> 18:10.757
and MacroJL also share

18:10.790 --> 18:12.091
several key verbal phrases.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.864
CHARLIE: The technical term for
this kind of thing

18:17.897 --> 18:19.632
is "mighty suspicious."

18:19.666 --> 18:20.767
Okay, let's get him, right?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.804
Josh Skinner,
aka DogBoy88.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.473
Nice digs.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.146
Tax records say he's 23.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.681
I guess DogBoy
is staying with the folks.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.151
- Yes?
- FBI, ma'am.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.652
Agent Sinclair--
this is Agent Warner.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.422
We need to talk
with Josh Skinner.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.823
He isn't here.
What's he done now?

18:43.856 --> 18:45.825
What do you mean,
"What's he done?"

18:45.858 --> 18:47.694
My son is off
his meds again.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.896
Off his meds?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.531
Josh is schizophrenic,
Agent Sinclair,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.266
so whatever he's done,
it's because he's sick.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.469
He's not a criminal;
he's a sick child.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.372
What's the trouble this time?

18:59.406 --> 19:02.509
He posted something online,
and we just want to talk to him.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.744
Is, uh... is that Josh

19:04.777 --> 19:05.878
right there?

19:05.912 --> 19:08.548
His father died in 2006.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.882
Josh was diagnosed

19:09.916 --> 19:11.518
nine months later.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.885
Do you know where he is?

19:14.221 --> 19:15.255
Should be in class.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.656
He's an undergrad at CalSci.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.459
(dog barking)

19:22.929 --> 19:26.499
Josh brought this little guy
home last night.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.536
He wants to release him
into the wild.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.740
CHARLIE:
According to his file,

19:33.773 --> 19:36.309
Josh Skinner is in a history
of science lecture right now.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.744
- And where is that?
- It's this way.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.746
Okay, so what's the deal
with this kid?

19:39.779 --> 19:40.813
CHARLIE:
Let's see.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.315
He's a philosophy major

19:42.349 --> 19:43.816
with a minor in...

19:43.850 --> 19:45.585
math.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.287
- What?
- There's been some evidence

19:47.320 --> 19:50.323
to suggest that
mathematical ability

19:50.357 --> 19:52.359
correlates with
schizophrenia.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.626
Really?

19:53.660 --> 19:54.794
The same gene.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.964
People who are predisposed
to higher abstract thinking

19:57.997 --> 20:00.867
are often quite vulnerable
to mental illness.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.236
Like, uh, John Nash
in A Beautiful Mind.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.605
Yeah, and, you know,
Nash hated taking his medication

20:05.638 --> 20:07.640
'cause it prevented him
from doing math.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.842
It's possible that Josh
is facing the same dilemma.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.279
So, uh, the... the meds,
they dull his mind.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.346
Yeah, but
without them,

20:13.380 --> 20:14.914
he won't be able
to grasp reality.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.583
If he called
for a flash mob,

20:16.616 --> 20:18.385
he's got some sense
of what's what.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.521
Well, stress can trigger
unpredictable behavior.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.590
Listen, I would just suggest

20:23.623 --> 20:26.025
approaching him
as calmly as possible.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.894
Okay?

20:27.927 --> 20:30.397
Um... building's open.

20:30.430 --> 20:34.033
Yeah, well, you know,
CalSci is determined

20:34.066 --> 20:35.668
not to buckle
to these attacks.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.604
Lecture hall
is on the first floor.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.706
All right, we'll take it
from here, Charlie.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.816
FEMALE LECTURER: Though Galileo
Galilei conducted research

20:49.849 --> 20:51.984
by using experiments,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.987
he argued his ideas in the form
of pure mathematics,

20:55.021 --> 20:58.057
a daring and creative evolution

20:58.090 --> 20:59.359
of the scientific method.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.960
Galileo gave us math

21:00.993 --> 21:04.664
as proof and predictor
of reality.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.765
(inaudible whisper)

21:05.798 --> 21:07.734
That's it for today.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.702
Next week, Descartes' unfinished

21:09.736 --> 21:11.871
Rules for the Direction
of the Mind.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.706
Excuse me.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.978
(screams)
(screams)

21:19.011 --> 21:20.480
Take it easy. FBI!

21:20.513 --> 21:21.948
FBI!

21:21.981 --> 21:22.982
(panicked shouting)

21:25.017 --> 21:26.653
CLOUD:
Move it! Move it!

21:26.686 --> 21:28.488
I see you.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.822
- You can't hide.
- DAVID: Easy, Josh.

21:29.856 --> 21:30.990
Calm down, buddy.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.392
(echoing):
Just calm down, okay?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.660
Take it easy.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.728
(gunshot, screaming)

21:35.762 --> 21:36.663
Get down!

21:37.864 --> 21:39.799
(students screaming)

21:45.472 --> 21:46.839
(gunshot)

21:46.873 --> 21:47.840
(professor screaming)

21:47.874 --> 21:48.708
CLOUD:
What are you doing?

21:48.741 --> 21:49.842
Stop shooting.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.679
DAVID:
Hey, calm down.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.414
- Don't move!
- Let him go.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.384
- I don't think so.
- Let him go.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.556
Stay back.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.024
JOSH:
Stay back.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.401
Just take it easy,
Josh, okay?

22:14.434 --> 22:15.402
We can work this out.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.703
(screams)
Don't move.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.707
I won't.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.755
Solid core double door.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.824
Single key
with a dead bolt lock.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.429
He got off
two shots.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.863
Four left in that revolver.

22:43.896 --> 22:49.001
Josh, we want a peaceful
outcome here.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.005
DAVID: We don't want anybody to
get hurt.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.510
DAVID:
Okay, how do we do that?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.011
You tried to kill me.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.148
Josh, we came to talk to you.

23:02.181 --> 23:05.418
Right...right, talk to me...

23:05.452 --> 23:07.153
talk to me with guns.

23:09.789 --> 23:10.823
(dialing)

23:14.060 --> 23:16.028
Who's the other kid?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.431
Students ID'd him
as Cloud Jamieson, freshman.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.799
Background check
came up empty.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.068
DON:
So no windows, huh?

23:22.101 --> 23:24.070
No sniper shot. What
about the back room?

23:24.103 --> 23:25.938
What's this along here?

23:25.972 --> 23:26.939
That's a wet wall,

23:26.973 --> 23:29.208
where they run plumbing
and electrical lines.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.743
Great, I can
get in here.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.178
David, listen to me.
I want you to keep them

23:32.211 --> 23:33.212
(over radio): near the door,
okay; we're gonna come in

23:33.245 --> 23:34.481
through the back.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.148
I'll cut my
way in here.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.084
All right, Scotty, Petey,
you go with her.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.088
DAVID:
Josh,

23:42.121 --> 23:44.123
let's work this out.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.958
Okay, buddy, I know
you're scared.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.495
Cloud Jamieson,

23:48.528 --> 23:49.996
how you doing
in there?

23:50.029 --> 23:50.997
I...

23:51.030 --> 23:52.865
Don't talk to him.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.000
I want a camera.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.103
I want a video camera
with a live feed to the media

23:57.136 --> 23:59.506
so that people can see
the atrocity against animals

23:59.539 --> 24:00.640
that's happening
in here.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.941
Don't point
that at me, man.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.210
A video camera--
I can work on that for you.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.579
They want a video camera; all
right, we got one in the truck.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.615
We're gonna give this guy
what he wants?

24:08.648 --> 24:09.782
No, we're gonna

24:09.816 --> 24:10.483
use it as a bargaining chip.
Run and get it, all right?

24:10.517 --> 24:11.317
- DON: Hey.
- CHARLIE: Hey.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.652
So Larry's got Lorna
on the phone.

24:12.685 --> 24:13.653
She's in the room

24:13.686 --> 24:14.954
- behind the lab.
- What?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.689
The office behind
the lab where Josh is.

24:16.723 --> 24:19.225
Okay, here's Don.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.794
Lorna, how you doing?

24:21.828 --> 24:23.062
Okay.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.263
They have
Professor Sharad Varma.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.599
He's... he's bleeding

24:26.633 --> 24:28.200
- but conscious.
- All right,

24:28.234 --> 24:29.235
ju-just try
and stay calm.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.670
Where are they
in the room?

24:30.703 --> 24:32.572
Sharad and the student
with the gun are

24:32.605 --> 24:33.906
on the north side.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.842
Sharad's on the floor.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.644
The other student--
he's moving around.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.278
Okay, Lorna, there is a vent

24:39.311 --> 24:40.847
somewhere on the floor in there.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.083
Okay, you think
you can get down into it?

24:44.116 --> 24:45.184
It's bolted shut.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.753
All right, hang tight.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.287
I'm gonna get someone in there
for you, all right?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.522
Just keep her
on the line.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.857
You know, Amita
and I are going

24:50.890 --> 24:52.191
to go through Josh's
student writing.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.160
We're going to get insight
into how his mind works.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.928
All right, good. Let me know
if there's any triggers

24:55.962 --> 24:57.029
I should avoid all right?

24:57.063 --> 24:57.597
All right.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.565
(garbled radio chatter)

25:04.671 --> 25:06.172
Josh, how is
the professor doing?

25:06.205 --> 25:10.009
Can you tell
me that?

25:10.042 --> 25:12.111
I'm not talking to you.
I'm not talking to you.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.145
I'm not talking to you.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.180
You're an assassin.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.982
I can't let you
into my brain.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.685
(stammering):
Josh, I am working

25:18.718 --> 25:20.620
- on that camera for you.
- Shut up. Shut up.

25:22.221 --> 25:25.291
DON:
Amita.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.158
he's never going
to get his trust.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.027
Give me a crack at him.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.328
- You?
- You ever done this?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.229
No.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.030
What you should do is get me
hooked up

25:31.063 --> 25:32.799
to the phone in there,
all right?

25:32.832 --> 25:34.333
David,

25:34.366 --> 25:36.302
- I want you to stand down.
- DAVID: Roger that.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.704
I'm only agitating him.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.071
DON:
All right, I got it from here.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.241
Liz, how are you doing?

25:44.376 --> 25:46.813
We're almost

25:46.846 --> 25:47.914
in the wall.

25:47.947 --> 25:48.915
Lorna said

25:48.948 --> 25:50.216
he's breaking things.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.654
- There's too many voices.
- Josh,

25:54.687 --> 25:56.589
come on,
we got to figure this out.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.590
This is
out of control.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.725
PROFESSOR:
Don't worry.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.260
Nobody will make you do anything
you don't want to, Josh.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.030
Josh-- why is everyone
saying my name?

26:04.063 --> 26:05.064
Josh, Josh, Josh.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.065
My name...

26:06.098 --> 26:07.867
is Sharad.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.270
Sharad.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.773
JOSH:
What kind of name is that?

26:13.806 --> 26:14.907
Hindu.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.076
- Indian.
- You should revere animals.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.077
I do.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.246
I am a vegetarian.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.982
So you don't eat them,
but torturing them is fine?

26:23.015 --> 26:26.318
No, I don't believe in torture.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.353
You work in
this building.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.354
I've seen you.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.756
Do you experiment with animals?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.025
I take good care of my animals.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.694
You torment them
for a living.

26:34.727 --> 26:35.928
You inject them
with disease,

26:35.962 --> 26:37.930
then you cut them open
to see what you've done.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.298
There's a holocaust going on
in this building,

26:39.331 --> 26:40.299
and I'm gonna stop it.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.868
Josh.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.670
Oh, my, God,
they're going to kill Sharad.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.806
Don't.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.240
- Don't do that, please.
- SHARAD: Lorna,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.209
what are you doing here?

26:53.980 --> 26:54.947
You see her?

26:54.981 --> 26:56.115
Is she really here?

26:57.383 --> 26:59.351
Yeah, man, she's really here.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.389
You can't trick me.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.025
Don, she went in there.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.860
LARRY: She's in there right now.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.362
LORNA: I just want to check on
Professor Varma.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.798
He's bleeding.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.065
Sharad.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.867
SHARAD:
Stop!

27:14.901 --> 27:16.235
Who's in there?
Who else is in there?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.037
You were supposed
to check, man.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.071
I did.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.844
It's empty; she was hiding.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.112
JOSH:
All right, duct-tape the vents

27:26.145 --> 27:28.080
and the doors to make sure they
can't get their cameras in here.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.682
No light.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.283
Everything you do is hidden.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.351
Well, I'm gonna
torture you

27:32.384 --> 27:34.286
like you torture your lab
animals, just like I did

27:34.320 --> 27:35.387
to the old man.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.789
You killed him.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.157
- No, we didn't.
- He died.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.026
He's dead. You killed him!

27:43.930 --> 27:46.766
He deserved it and so do you.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.272
(grunts)

27:57.243 --> 27:59.211
(breathing heavily)

28:01.380 --> 28:03.415
(screams)

28:04.751 --> 28:06.719
Describe your work.

28:06.753 --> 28:10.189
You slice open animal brains?
You sew their eyes open?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.824
What's your
torture?

28:11.858 --> 28:13.726
(phone ringing)

28:18.765 --> 28:20.933
JOSH:
Who is it?

28:20.967 --> 28:23.469
Josh, this is Don Eppes;
I'm with the FBI.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.536
I'd like to work things out
with you here,

28:24.570 --> 28:26.405
and I-I got you that camera
you were asking for.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.506
Is that so?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.141
Does it have a bomb in it?

28:29.175 --> 28:30.342
No, and I can promise you

28:30.376 --> 28:33.846
I won't lie to you, Josh,
but I want to trade the camera

28:33.880 --> 28:36.348
for Professor Varma so we can
get him some medical help.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.149
What about

28:37.183 --> 28:38.150
the live video feed?

28:38.184 --> 28:39.151
I got the camera right now,

28:39.185 --> 28:40.486
so how about we start there?

28:40.519 --> 28:42.354
Let's not.
(line disconnects)

28:42.388 --> 28:43.890
Lie to him.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.357
I mean, fake a live feed.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.393
You never lie to them, Nikki.
That's the first rule.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.797
We get the camera in there,
we can see what's going on.

28:50.830 --> 28:51.530
It seems like a reasonable plan.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.531
Lying's
always worked

28:52.564 --> 28:54.233
- for me.
- Well,

28:54.266 --> 28:55.935
these kind of negotiations
are different.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.103
Why don't you go relieve
David, okay?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.504
Send him back here,
please.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.973
So tell me, what are
the probabilities

29:01.007 --> 29:02.508
everybody walks out alive?

29:04.844 --> 29:07.313
That's the goal, Larry.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.247
Yeah.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.784
(sighs)

29:11.818 --> 29:13.519
All right,
I will check in with Charlie

29:13.552 --> 29:18.490
and see if he's got anything
on this very troubled young man.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.792
What are we doing?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.861
CHARLIE:
You know, his papers are riddled

29:21.894 --> 29:23.195
with inductive
argument fallacies,

29:23.229 --> 29:24.430
but his math is so creative,

29:24.463 --> 29:26.098
so original.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.900
It's just terribly sad
to lose a mind like this

29:27.934 --> 29:29.535
- to mental illness.
- In this one,

29:29.568 --> 29:32.271
he uses reason to prove
that reason is not valuable.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.973
I think there's a
larger intention.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.275
Here is an ecological model
of the prisoner's dilemma

29:36.308 --> 29:38.510
constructed to prove
that altruism in animals exceeds

29:38.544 --> 29:39.578
that of humans.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.280
What do you think
he's getting at?

29:41.313 --> 29:44.416
Schizophrenics often feel

29:44.450 --> 29:46.518
like they have a direct line
to the divine.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.922
Josh Skinner's god seems

29:49.956 --> 29:52.291
to be animals.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.135
I respect animals, you know.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.037
Do you have any pets?

30:06.172 --> 30:08.975
I have a dog.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.176
You shouldn't
own a pet

30:10.209 --> 30:11.844
any more than you
should own a slave.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.846
You're destroying his soul.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.481
(phone ringing)

30:17.884 --> 30:18.851
Hello?

30:18.885 --> 30:19.919
Josh, I'm not even going

30:19.952 --> 30:21.854
to discuss a live feed with you
until you give me

30:21.888 --> 30:23.055
Professor Varma.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.891
No, he has to confess
his crimes first

30:24.924 --> 30:27.894
on camera.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.896
All right,
I'll give you the camera.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.998
You open the door,

30:32.031 --> 30:33.599
I'll give it to you.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.338
Sure.

30:39.371 --> 30:40.639
- Come on in.
- DON: All right, I'm coming.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.108
Let's just stay calm now, Josh.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.614
I'm calm.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.282
You calm?

30:50.316 --> 30:51.951
(overlapping chatter)

30:51.984 --> 30:53.986
I'll get in the door and then
I'll just see the layout.

30:54.020 --> 30:54.987
I won't call it
unless

30:55.021 --> 30:56.288
the situation gets compromised.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.958
(garbled radio transmission)

30:58.991 --> 31:00.492
DAVID:
Liz, how are you doing?

31:00.526 --> 31:01.928
Almost there.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.396
(grunts)

31:19.145 --> 31:20.446
I surrender, man!

31:20.479 --> 31:21.680
I'm non-violent!

31:21.713 --> 31:22.881
Where are you going, man?
They're dangerous.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.151
I didn't mean to kill anybody!
I didn't sign up for this!

31:25.184 --> 31:27.686
Josh, we're coming in now.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.088
Nice and easy.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.222
JOSH:
What are you doing with him?

31:30.256 --> 31:32.258
Don't hurt him.
He's scared.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.960
Okay? We're not
gonna hurt anybody.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.995
Just relax. Here's

31:36.028 --> 31:37.163
the camera, right?

31:37.196 --> 31:38.998
Just like I
promised.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.533
I'd like to get the
professor some help.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.207
Sarah?

31:54.046 --> 31:56.082
What are you doing here?

31:56.115 --> 31:58.650
Hey, Josh.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.619
Hey. How you doing?

32:00.652 --> 32:02.254
Uh, fi... I'm great.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.422
Wait, wait, wait.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.324
How-how did you know
I was here?

32:05.357 --> 32:06.692
Did you see it
on the news?

32:06.725 --> 32:07.994
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.230
Okay, here's the camera.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.733
All right? I'm just
gonna put it down.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.102
Relax.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.369
I'm gonna put it down
right here,

32:17.403 --> 32:21.207
and we're
gonna go, okay?

32:21.240 --> 32:24.143
Okay?

32:24.176 --> 32:26.278
We're going.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.713
Sarah, you're going
to stay, right?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.248
Yeah, sure, I am.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.317
No, she's got to
come with me.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.052
- Sarah stays.
- I can't do that.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.220
NIKKI:
Okay.

32:34.253 --> 32:37.356
Okay. I got this.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.258
Get out!

32:43.695 --> 32:46.032
Close the door.

32:53.439 --> 32:56.675
Let's talk for a minute,
all right?

32:56.708 --> 32:58.210
I can't believe
you came to help me.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.745
All right, so, uh,
who should we kill?

32:59.778 --> 33:01.480
Nobody, Josh.

33:05.251 --> 33:08.154
(echoing):
Let's, uh...

33:08.187 --> 33:09.788
Let's put our guns
down, all right?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.224
You first.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.171
DAVID (over radio):
Heads up, Liz.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.173
Nikki is in the room with them.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.607
What's Nikki doing in there?

33:28.640 --> 33:30.709
Skinner thinks she's someone
named Sarah, which means

33:30.742 --> 33:32.578
he is dangerously out of touch
with reality, okay?

33:32.611 --> 33:33.545
Use extreme caution.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.713
Right.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.182
All right, guys, listen up now.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.383
He's got Lorna here
in the center

33:37.416 --> 33:38.684
with a gun to her head.

33:38.717 --> 33:42.188
He's got the professor here
on the four side.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.256
Now, Nikki is by the door.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.625
Right? So, we're gonna
be going in behind her.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.660
Okay. My access point
is straight into the lab,

33:48.694 --> 33:51.697
but I'm going in blind,
so I wait for your go.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.599
DAVID:
Now, Liz,

33:53.632 --> 33:55.201
you're coming in
behind Skinner, okay?

33:55.234 --> 33:57.103
Nikki may be firing
in your direction.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.270
All right, got it.
I'll stay low.

33:58.304 --> 33:59.605
DON:
So, Liz is gonna be coming in

33:59.638 --> 34:01.573
from here then, right?
There's an access here.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.109
Got it? Let's go.
Move, move.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.111
Should we give Nikki a-a chance
to talk him down?

34:05.144 --> 34:07.279
No way, David.
She's in way over her head.

34:12.151 --> 34:16.588
Josh, hey, let's you
and me get out of here, huh?

34:16.622 --> 34:19.225
I thought you were going
to help me. I can't leave.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.859
I mean, this is the most
important day of my life.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.194
I'm exposing them.

34:22.228 --> 34:22.628
All right, let's go talk
about it.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.163
Talk about what?

34:24.196 --> 34:25.231
Slaughter
in the name of science?

34:25.264 --> 34:26.698
The screams of the animals

34:26.732 --> 34:28.700
- in these labs?
- No. I know.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.703
I just think we should,
you know, take a breath, okay?

34:31.737 --> 34:34.406
Okay, your face
is turning colors

34:34.440 --> 34:36.242
like it always does
when you lie.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.310
Why are you pointing
that gun at me?

34:38.344 --> 34:41.713
Let's put them both down, okay?

34:41.747 --> 34:42.714
They turned you.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.116
Oh, my God.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.484
(sighs)

34:45.517 --> 34:47.486
I thought you were pure
like the animals,

34:47.519 --> 34:49.421
but you're just another
corrupt Homo sapien.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.658
Confess before you pass out.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.560
What kind of work
do you do?

34:54.593 --> 34:56.162
(sighs)

34:56.195 --> 34:59.431
Researching a vaccine for HIV.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.300
On what animals?

35:01.333 --> 35:02.601
Tell me!

35:02.634 --> 35:05.437
I can look it up.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.872
Rhesus macaques.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.375
They have, like, 99%
the same DNA as humans.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.609
How can you
do that?!

35:10.642 --> 35:11.510
Stop, all right?

35:11.543 --> 35:12.778
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.316
I'm not going to let
you kill anybody, Josh.

35:17.349 --> 35:18.517
Traitor.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.252
(sighs)

35:20.286 --> 35:21.553
Are you even really here?

35:21.587 --> 35:24.390
She's really
here, Josh.

35:24.423 --> 35:28.260
Wh... Why should I believe you?

35:28.294 --> 35:30.762
(panting)

35:33.265 --> 35:35.767
So, what's underneath Josh
Skinner's twisted thinking

35:35.801 --> 35:38.404
is belief that animals
have higher spiritual powers

35:38.437 --> 35:39.305
than human beings.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.707
He seems to really despise
human beings

35:41.740 --> 35:42.874
as being inferior
and corrupt.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.476
One might surmise that
from the fact

35:44.510 --> 35:46.278
that he's holding several
of them hostage,

35:46.312 --> 35:47.446
but how does that help us?

35:47.479 --> 35:48.580
He believes
animals are gods.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.582
And what does a believer do
for a god?

35:50.616 --> 35:52.184
Ah! Obey.

35:53.285 --> 35:54.753
JOSH:
Say it. Tell the truth!

35:54.786 --> 35:56.188
LORNA:
I study the migratory

35:56.222 --> 35:57.389
patterns of birds

35:57.423 --> 35:58.824
and outbreaks of avian flu.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.326
- You kill birds!
- No.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.593
I will shoot you.
Tell the truth.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.495
You cut them open.
You kill birds.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.431
- I don't kill birds.
- Liar! Say it.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.266
You cut their beaks off,

36:07.299 --> 36:08.400
you torture them. I hear

36:08.434 --> 36:09.368
their screams in this building.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.736
Lorna.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.471
I am pro-research,
and I am pro-animal.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.772
You can't be both.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.641
(gun chamber clicking)
NIKKI: Josh!

36:15.674 --> 36:17.343
(door opening)

36:26.818 --> 36:27.319
Hey.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.188
Hey, where did you come from?

36:31.423 --> 36:32.591
JOSH:
No!

36:32.624 --> 36:34.226
Arms behind your back.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.462
(mumbles)

36:36.495 --> 36:37.829
Don't hurt the dog!

36:37.863 --> 36:39.565
The dog is safe.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.769
You okay?

36:46.004 --> 36:47.973
Glad to see you.

36:48.006 --> 36:48.874
Yeah. Sure.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.445
Hey, that was close,
but it worked out.

36:53.479 --> 36:54.980
Well, you screwed up.

36:55.013 --> 36:57.449
Look, I was improvising
in a highly dynamic situation.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.251
I don't care. Want to do this,
learn how to do it right.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.460
You all right?

37:08.494 --> 37:10.496
(sighs)

37:10.529 --> 37:12.598
Having the dog come in
was so insightful.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.865
Who thought of it?

37:30.982 --> 37:34.353
LARRY: Well, school is getting
back to normal.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.923
CHARLIE:
Yeah.

37:37.956 --> 37:41.393
LARRY: Certainly was nice to see
you back in your lab.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.431
I'm ready.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.632
Ha ha!

37:46.665 --> 37:48.600
So, you're serious
about this?

37:48.634 --> 37:50.336
Oh, they have no idea
what they're in for.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.837
LARRY:
Amita, tell me.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.639
Do you have
an athletic history?

37:53.672 --> 37:54.906
Yeah, intramurals
in high school.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.308
ALAN:
Well,

37:56.342 --> 37:57.976
that counts. Sort of.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.445
(Amita sighs)

37:59.478 --> 38:00.879
You ready?

38:00.912 --> 38:03.014
You're going to have
to be our secret weapon,

38:03.048 --> 38:05.684
because my better sport
has always been crosswords.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.855
We'll be waiting for you
with ice packs on your return.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.457
Bye.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.025
She's got gumption.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.694
I'll, I'll say that
about her.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.864
She does.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.399
She really does.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.033
Oh, uh, you were talking
about Amita?

38:22.067 --> 38:24.470
Yes, I was.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.406
You and Lorna, huh?

38:27.439 --> 38:29.941
Well, yeah,
she's an impressive woman.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.510
Well, I can see that.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.081
Well, Dad, I'm, uh...
I'm slaughtering you at chess.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.417
Shall we call it a draw
and go grab something to eat?

38:38.450 --> 38:39.585
Yeah, why don't we?

38:39.618 --> 38:40.552
LARRY:
Guess I should warn you.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.521
I am considering vegetarianism.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.455
ALAN:
You are?

38:43.489 --> 38:44.590
Why?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.658
Well, this unnerving event

38:46.692 --> 38:49.928
has inspired in me
ethical considerations

38:49.961 --> 38:52.398
of animal cognition
and experimentation.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.466
And until I know
what my opinion is,

38:54.500 --> 38:56.468
I think I should refrain

38:56.502 --> 38:59.371
from devouring the subject
of my search.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.806
- Fair enough.
- Mm.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.108
It is a complex moral matter.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.910
I mean, virtually
every advance in medicine

39:04.943 --> 39:07.145
for the last century
has been at the expense

39:07.178 --> 39:08.680
of experimental animals,

39:08.714 --> 39:10.482
but where do you
draw the line?

39:10.516 --> 39:11.650
In invertebrates?

39:11.683 --> 39:13.151
Does drosophila
not suffer?

39:13.184 --> 39:14.686
Pity the poor fruit fly.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.921
Is Lorna a vegetarian?

39:15.954 --> 39:17.489
Yes, she is.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.157
So this is really
about lust, then.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.559
Oh!

39:20.592 --> 39:21.727
She is very
impressive.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.562
That's what I thought.

39:23.595 --> 39:29.435
* And in all the spaces

39:29.468 --> 39:32.738
* What kind of life
have you made? *

39:33.872 --> 39:35.707
(grunting)

39:35.741 --> 39:36.675
(groans)

39:36.708 --> 39:38.510
Hey, were you really
going to let that guy

39:38.544 --> 39:40.512
shoot you before you said
what he wanted to hear?

39:40.546 --> 39:41.847
I can be stubborn.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.682
Yeah, I don't know nothing
about that.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.183
Hey, speaking
of hardheaded,

39:45.216 --> 39:47.519
I hear Don's sending you to
hostage negotiation training.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.722
* Ah... well,
you don't need me *

39:50.756 --> 39:51.723
Oh!

39:51.757 --> 39:53.592
Dang! You're on fire, Amita.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.860
(laughs)

39:54.893 --> 39:56.528
I thought we were going to have
to take it easy on the eggheads.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.362
I thought you said you played.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.897
NIKKI:
In a minute, I'm gonna have

39:58.930 --> 40:00.599
to switch partners.

40:00.632 --> 40:01.667
Another set?

40:01.700 --> 40:02.734
Let's go.
