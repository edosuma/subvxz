SELINA: Oh, Kentucky fried Christ!

00:12.222 --> 00:15.556
It's like Satan's humidor out here.
My God!

00:15.558 --> 00:17.692
Flying a thousand miles to Alabama.

00:17.694 --> 00:20.528
I mean, is anyone as shocked
as I am that I'm doing this?

00:20.530 --> 00:22.363
Well, I'm easily shocked, so
probably not the best person to ask.

00:22.365 --> 00:24.832
- So, here we are! My boyhood home.
- What?!

00:24.834 --> 00:26.634
Ma'am, I gotta tell you,
you coming to my birthday

00:26.636 --> 00:28.603
is what gave me the strength to
get through that heart attack...

00:28.605 --> 00:30.037
- You're welcome.
- and when I had my relapse.

00:30.039 --> 00:31.339
You had a relapse?

00:31.341 --> 00:32.973
Oh, I thought you were just being lazy.

00:32.975 --> 00:34.808
Hey, Gary, how come your
family doesn't have

00:34.810 --> 00:37.044
a Mongoloid kid on the
porch playing banjo?

00:37.046 --> 00:38.746
- 'Cause he grew up and moved to DC.
- <i>(DOOR OPENS)</i>

00:38.748 --> 00:42.850
- Ah, Mama!
- Gary Walsh, you get on up here!

00:42.852 --> 00:44.618
It's like he's never
seen his mother before.

00:44.620 --> 00:47.821
Ma'am, Tanz and the other donors
are getting really restless

00:47.823 --> 00:49.790
about this lack of
progress on the library,

00:49.792 --> 00:51.258
so we need to get some new money ASAP

00:51.260 --> 00:52.526
or we have to give back the old money.

00:52.528 --> 00:54.294
- That's a real snatch-22.
- Yeah.

00:54.296 --> 00:56.329
- (BOTH CHEERING)
- AMY: <i> And also, we have another email</i>

00:56.331 --> 00:58.331
<i>from Jaffar in New York.
"I need to see you."</i>

00:58.333 --> 01:00.634
Just email him back a hard no,

01:00.636 --> 01:02.969
but make it sound kind of sexy
so he knows what he's missing.

01:02.971 --> 01:06.506
Why am I asking somebody who has
sex one and a half times a year

01:06.508 --> 01:07.508
to do that?

01:07.509 --> 01:09.042
- SELINA: Hello!
- Mama, okay...

01:09.044 --> 01:11.344
- Oh, you must be Amy.
- This is... yes.

01:11.346 --> 01:14.180
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- And you obviously are Richard.

01:14.182 --> 01:17.150
- 'Cause of the glasses, yeah.
- And, Madam President, it's...

01:17.152 --> 01:17.952
Yes.

01:17.954 --> 01:20.352
It... it's an honor to have
you at our humble home.

01:20.354 --> 01:23.890
It is such a... a treat to
be here in Lynch City.

01:23.892 --> 01:25.424
It's White City. We
couldn't afford Lynch City.

01:25.426 --> 01:26.993
- All right.
- Where's Judge?

01:26.995 --> 01:29.595
- Your dad's a judge?
- (LAUGHING) Oh, no! No.

01:29.597 --> 01:31.330
Judge isn't back yet from his
hunting trip with Stewart.

01:31.332 --> 01:32.698
Stewart? I don't remember Stewart.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.634
- Stewart's the new Bobby.
- Oh!

01:35.636 --> 01:37.236
He's always grooming some new associate

01:37.238 --> 01:38.937
- <i>in his law firm.</i>
- Maybe we can go inside.

01:38.939 --> 01:41.607
He takes his boys real, real seriously.

01:41.609 --> 01:43.475
- SELINA: <i> Hi, honey.</i>
- Happy birthday, Gary!

01:43.477 --> 01:45.444
Catherine and Mr.
Marjorie have been here

01:45.446 --> 01:46.812
and they've been keeping me in stitches!

01:46.814 --> 01:49.014
- Okay, it's a lady.
- Oh.

01:49.016 --> 01:51.649
MIKE: <i> We're finishing up President
Meyer's memoir this week...</i>

01:51.651 --> 01:53.351
- No one is gonna read that.
- and darn it

01:53.353 --> 01:55.687
if I haven't been bitten
by the writing bug.

01:55.689 --> 01:57.923
I wanna write a syndicated humor column

01:57.925 --> 02:00.125
like Dave Barry or Erma.

02:00.127 --> 02:01.960
Mike, do you have any awareness
of what's been happening

02:01.962 --> 02:03.961
with newspapers in the last 10 years?

02:03.963 --> 02:06.397
Not at all. I mean, truth is I
don't even get 'em anymore.

02:06.399 --> 02:07.865
I just read the news on my phone.

02:07.867 --> 02:09.734
It's so much better and it's free.

02:09.735 --> 02:10.967
Yeah, that makes sense.

02:10.970 --> 02:12.670
Let me just give you a little taste

02:12.672 --> 02:14.939
- of the McLintock prose, okay?
- Oh, God.

02:14.941 --> 02:17.174
"The other day, I found
my daughter, Ellen,

02:17.176 --> 02:19.676
sitting in her closet
eating cello bow rosin."

02:19.678 --> 02:22.079
- Creepy.
- "So, I sat her down and we dialogued."

02:22.081 --> 02:24.414
- That's not a word.
- "And we agreed that it was okay

02:24.416 --> 02:26.550
for her to sit in her closet

02:26.552 --> 02:29.754
and it was okay for her to
eat cello bow rosin"...

02:29.756 --> 02:31.521
- It's not.
- "but it was not okay

02:31.523 --> 02:33.523
for her to do both at the same time.

02:33.525 --> 02:38.828
I think we both found that
solution very 'rosinable.'"

02:38.830 --> 02:41.465
(CHUCKLING)

02:41.467 --> 02:43.734
Okay, well, Mike... (CHUCKLES)

02:43.736 --> 02:45.736
if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

02:45.738 --> 02:48.438
Thank you so much, Leon.
I owe you big-time.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.574
And you know what, I'll send
you a couple McLintock morsels

02:50.576 --> 02:51.808
just to whet your appetite.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.376
I do not want you to do that.

02:53.378 --> 02:55.211
- I will.
- Don't.

02:55.213 --> 02:56.312
- I'm gonna.
- No.

02:56.314 --> 02:57.380
GARY: <i>I can't believe</i>

02:57.382 --> 02:58.681
<i>y'all are in my house!</i>

02:58.683 --> 03:00.850
I know, I can't believe it either.

03:00.852 --> 03:03.519
I promise this party is
gonna be so elegant.

03:03.521 --> 03:05.388
- Very "New South."
- Yes.

03:05.390 --> 03:08.724
What does that mean? No butt-fucking Ned
Beatty till the after party, I guess.

03:08.726 --> 03:10.993
No, there is gonna be a raw bar.

03:10.995 --> 03:12.728
- And the very best Southern chef.
- Thank you.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.930
Yes, who hasn't said the
N-word on television.

03:14.932 --> 03:16.465
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.966
Ma'am, I really think
that we need to discuss

03:17.968 --> 03:20.736
my doing something other
than the library.

03:20.738 --> 03:21.472
It's just...

03:21.474 --> 03:23.673
Do you have any social
skills whatsoever?

03:23.675 --> 03:26.275
I mean, my God, Amy, we're
in the middle of visiting

03:26.277 --> 03:28.110
with what's-his-ass's family here.

03:28.112 --> 03:30.445
- Aw, so nice.
- Hey, birthday boy, I need my purse.

03:30.447 --> 03:33.515
- I gotta get my eye drops.
- JUDGE: <i> Well, hello to the house!</i>

03:33.517 --> 03:35.450
- Oh, there he is! Judge is home.
- Hey, honey.

03:36.954 --> 03:39.754
Well, well, well, look at that!

03:39.756 --> 03:41.989
Hey, everybody, not home an hour

03:41.991 --> 03:44.225
and Gary's carrying a Jimmy Choo purse.

03:44.227 --> 03:47.329
- Oh.
- Some things never change, huh?

03:47.331 --> 03:49.364
It's for the president.
The president, Judge.

03:49.366 --> 03:51.032
- Oh, the president!
- GARY: Yes.

03:51.034 --> 03:52.534
Hey, I was just joshing with ya.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.536
- I was joshing with ya.
- Ah! I know, okay.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.170
- Don't tear up, now.
- I'm not.

03:56.172 --> 03:57.405
You'll ruin your mascara.

03:57.407 --> 04:00.107
- Hey! Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Walsh.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.910
I did not vote for you, but
I do respect the office.

04:02.912 --> 04:04.946
Okay, well, you didn't have to say that,

04:04.948 --> 04:06.547
- but thank you very much.
- I understand.

04:06.549 --> 04:08.149
You know what, I saw that Tom James

04:08.151 --> 04:10.484
being interviewed on the
television about the two of you.

04:10.486 --> 04:12.686
- Oh, good. You saw that?
- Yeah, I did.

04:12.688 --> 04:14.322
My God, that's a good-looking man.

04:14.324 --> 04:15.856
Looks like he works out.

04:15.858 --> 04:17.558
- Where are my manners?
- Does he work out?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.593
<i>I'm gonna show you your rooms
so you can freshen up.</i>

04:19.595 --> 04:21.060
And, you two girls, I'm sorry.

04:21.063 --> 04:22.830
You're gonna have to share
that room downstairs.

04:22.832 --> 04:24.931
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, of course. We usually...

04:24.933 --> 04:27.200
Da, da, da, da, da, da. Coming, Mama!

04:27.202 --> 04:30.671
Madam President, the two of you
will be in separate bedrooms

04:30.673 --> 04:32.605
since you're not official yet.

04:32.607 --> 04:33.840
- Mama!
- What?

04:33.842 --> 04:36.142
- Nope, nothing.
- Oh, look at this.

04:36.144 --> 04:38.511
- You kept Gary's crib.
- It's not Gary's.

04:38.513 --> 04:41.348
- It's his brother Bruce's.
- Oh, I didn't know you had a brother.

04:41.350 --> 04:43.283
Brue was his stillborn twin.

04:43.285 --> 04:46.586
- He had a huge heart.
- Missing all its valves, though.

04:46.588 --> 04:48.954
- Here we go again!
- When Gary was in high school,

04:48.956 --> 04:52.525
I used to say Bruce still had a better
chance of making the football team.

04:53.528 --> 04:55.094
Them's fighting words.

04:55.096 --> 04:58.498
Madam President, we're gonna
leave you to get settled.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.132
Oh, Gary, can you stay
behind for a second?

05:00.134 --> 05:02.034
We have some scheduling things.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.203
- I can't sleep in here.
- I know.

05:04.205 --> 05:07.772
- And your father comes off a little...
- Hard on me, I know.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.240
- That, too.
- Mm-hmm.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.009
Wow, no wonder I couldn't
carry the South.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.443
I mean, none of the polling research

05:12.445 --> 05:14.445
mentioned a dead son's ghost crib.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.180
The ghost is gone.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.149
- Hmm?
- I mean, at least we think it's gone.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.318
Sometimes you hear crying, but
that's usually just Mama.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.221
I'm gonna sleep in your mom's
room or your dad's room.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.856
Okay, okay. How did you know
they sleep in separate rooms?

05:25.858 --> 05:27.858
- (CLICKING TONGUE)
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.628
I'll tell you something, if I had a
crib for every baby who died inside me,

05:30.630 --> 05:33.330
- I could open up a Pottery Barn Kids.
- Aha.

05:33.332 --> 05:36.166
The Daylight Savings
Time-loving bureaucrats

05:36.168 --> 05:37.668
have been "punching the clock"

05:37.670 --> 05:40.770
on the taxpayers' dime for too long.

05:40.772 --> 05:43.040
Well, now it's time for
me to punch a clock...

05:44.243 --> 05:45.409
with a hammer.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.313
- (WOMAN GASPS)
- (GRUNTS)

05:49.315 --> 05:50.580
At least while the
government's shut down,

05:50.582 --> 05:52.149
we won't have to pay taxes.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.351
- That's not how it works.
- Oh! (CHUCKLES)

05:54.353 --> 05:55.885
Homeless people...

05:55.887 --> 05:57.787
our very own Dan Egan goes undercover

05:57.789 --> 05:59.489
in our fourth installment of...

05:59.491 --> 06:02.158
"Life on the Streets,
Tears in the Gutter."

06:05.029 --> 06:06.963
We're back in two. Guys, let's talk.

06:06.965 --> 06:09.766
I don't know how to say this to you,
Danny, but the network is not happy.

06:09.768 --> 06:10.771
We need a game changer.

06:10.773 --> 06:13.169
Okay, well, I mean, we
could go back to fucking.

06:13.171 --> 06:15.271
Well, I wanted to wait till
after the wedding, but...

06:15.273 --> 06:17.473
They want you to get an interview
with the head of the Jeffersons.

06:17.475 --> 06:18.907
- I'm not doing it.
- Your job depends on it.

06:18.909 --> 06:21.510
- I'm not doing it.
- 10 seconds.

06:21.512 --> 06:22.911
You are fucking doing it,

06:22.913 --> 06:24.981
because I am not going back
to Yahoo fucking Style!

06:24.983 --> 06:28.084
And up next, a long-lost
letter from WWII

06:28.086 --> 06:31.186
finally delivered, ending
a 60-year marriage.

06:31.188 --> 06:32.521
JUDGE: <i>Good morning, uh...</i>

06:32.523 --> 06:34.089
Amy, Richard, and Madam President.

06:34.091 --> 06:35.491
Amy, Richard, Madam President.

06:35.493 --> 06:37.292
- Good morning...
- Judge and Imogene.

06:37.294 --> 06:38.594
Judge and Imogene.

06:38.596 --> 06:40.261
So, how are the plans coming

06:40.263 --> 06:41.597
- for the, um...
- BOTH: 40th.

06:41.599 --> 06:43.431
- 40th?
- The crystal came in today

06:43.433 --> 06:45.133
and I am just like, ah!

06:45.135 --> 06:46.834
JUDGE: Uh, Gary, if you'll excuse me,

06:46.836 --> 06:48.370
I'm gonna go fetch the papers.

06:48.372 --> 06:49.804
Now, see, look at that.

06:49.806 --> 06:51.606
Look... Madam President,
with all due respect,

06:51.608 --> 06:53.741
the government should get shut down.

06:53.743 --> 06:54.410
Uh-huh.

06:54.412 --> 06:56.411
And that's the kind of
man I could get behind,

06:56.413 --> 06:59.114
but the bowtie makes him look queer.

06:59.116 --> 07:02.050
Um, Mike, when did you get here?

07:02.052 --> 07:03.484
- Just a couple minutes ago, Ma'am.
- Oh.

07:03.486 --> 07:05.586
I got this really cheap flight.

07:05.588 --> 07:07.722
- <i>Had, like, four layovers.</i>
- I'm really sorry I asked that question.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.289
I really got here three hours early

07:09.291 --> 07:11.792
because we had to make an
emergency landing in Birmingham

07:11.794 --> 07:15.763
because some guy took a
poo on the beverage cart.

07:15.765 --> 07:17.231
And, no, it wasn't me.

07:17.233 --> 07:19.333
I'm actually really blocked
up from all the travel.

07:19.335 --> 07:21.768
And by the way, these
biscuits are amazing.

07:21.770 --> 07:24.138
- Oh, thank you, Mike.
- Ma'am, do you think that Mike

07:24.140 --> 07:27.141
- could benefit from closer supervision?
- She's not wrong.

07:27.143 --> 07:30.744
You know what, Amy, you are now in
charge of finishing the book with Mike.

07:30.746 --> 07:33.147
And, Richard, you're in
charge of the library.

07:33.149 --> 07:35.516
- What just happened?
- You're in charge of the library.

07:35.518 --> 07:36.950
- We're still doing that?
- Yeah!

07:36.952 --> 07:38.384
- I better get to work, then.
- Good luck.

07:38.386 --> 07:40.020
- Thanks.
- Well, we should get going.

07:40.022 --> 07:42.088
We're actually doing
a "herstorical" tour

07:42.090 --> 07:43.557
of great Southern female writers.

07:43.559 --> 07:44.958
And where they killed themselves.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.226
Catherine, you know,
everybody just woke up

07:47.228 --> 07:49.663
- and they don't wanna hear about...
- JUDGE: <i> Just get in there!</i>

07:49.665 --> 07:51.330
All right, Madam President,

07:51.332 --> 07:53.399
I found this person of interest
lurking around out there.

07:53.401 --> 07:54.667
- In a Ferrari.
- Yeah.

07:54.669 --> 07:56.635
You're kidding me. What is this?

07:56.637 --> 07:59.472
I tried to explain to him that Birmingham
ranks low on the jihadi to-do list.

07:59.474 --> 08:01.207
Did you tell him your
first name was Mohammad?

08:01.209 --> 08:03.209
- No.
- I can vouch for him for the most part.

08:03.211 --> 08:05.078
- JUDGE: That's fine with me.
- Let's get to work, Mike.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.512
Roll those sleeves up
to your pit stains.

08:06.514 --> 08:07.913
I need to talk to you in private.

08:07.915 --> 08:09.214
- This is so inappropriate.
- Excuse us.

08:09.216 --> 08:10.583
- It's not in here.
- What?

08:10.585 --> 08:12.284
- I don't have my diary.
- Then look harder!

08:12.286 --> 08:13.752
- It's gotta be in there!
- Shit.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.187
Mike, that diary is all you're good for.

08:15.189 --> 08:16.822
The diary should've lost you.

08:16.824 --> 08:19.091
Every detail of every day in the
White House was in that diary.

08:19.093 --> 08:20.926
Where do you think you might've left it?

08:20.928 --> 08:24.162
I did stop to eat at this truck stop
diner driving up from Birmingham.

08:24.164 --> 08:26.698
- No, you just ate breakfast now.
- No, I'm on DC time.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.633
It's an hour's difference! Let's go!

08:28.635 --> 08:31.136
Oh, good, they have great pancakes.
We'll split a stack.

08:31.138 --> 08:34.106
I don't understand. What
are you even doing here?

08:34.107 --> 08:36.274
Your man Richard told me to come down.

08:36.275 --> 08:39.211
I had some business in the Gulf with
Sturges Energy, but I had to see you.

08:39.212 --> 08:41.580
Oh, please, suddenly now
white lives matter?

08:41.582 --> 08:43.815
- I mean, I just...
- I'm sorry for how I behaved,

08:43.817 --> 08:46.050
but everything is different now that
my father's died of colon cancer,

08:46.052 --> 08:47.451
praise be to Allah.

08:47.453 --> 08:48.886
Plus, our family's got a brand-new imam

08:48.888 --> 08:50.054
who's just a lot more chill.

08:50.056 --> 08:51.589
I mean, I can engage in homosexual acts

08:51.591 --> 08:52.924
with the entire writing
staff of Charlie Hebdo

08:52.926 --> 08:54.158
and nobody would say boo.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.193
Well, you're getting me all wet now.

08:56.195 --> 08:58.429
- No, no, I didn't...
- Hey, did you say Sturges Energy?

08:58.431 --> 08:59.014
I did.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.764
Who donated that whole
wing to Hughes's library?

09:00.766 --> 09:02.199
Yeah, Quartie and I are dear friends.

09:02.201 --> 09:04.368
Our houses share a beach
path and a vineyard.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.969
We don't let the public
use it, of course.

09:05.971 --> 09:07.438
(SCOFFS) You had me at beach path.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.440
Yeah, Carly Simon is on the other side.

09:09.442 --> 09:12.843
You know, she has this tree. It just
sort of hangs over the property line.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.211
Could you do me a favor? You
think you could talk to Quartie

09:15.213 --> 09:17.147
about maybe donating a
few mil to my library?

09:17.149 --> 09:18.448
I'll make that call for you.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.450
Mm-mm, I haven't forgiven you yet.

09:20.452 --> 09:22.152
- Why? Come on.
- No. Plus, we're in Gary's house

09:22.154 --> 09:24.655
and this whole place is like a
vortex of sexual confusion.

09:24.657 --> 09:26.723
- I mean, witness. This...
- Oh, my God.

09:26.725 --> 09:28.659
GREG: <i>Hey, Dan, look at my sandwich.</i>

09:28.661 --> 09:29.398
Remind you of Jane?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.261
I really gotta stop
these weekly lunches.

09:31.263 --> 09:32.595
Should've kept the old gray mare.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.364
Your ratings ain't what they used to be.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.132
- I hear your days are numbered, boy-o.
- (PHONE BUZZING)

09:36.134 --> 09:38.868
Oh, this just might be the phone
call that changes all that.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.504
- Hey!
- Hold for Congressman Ryan.

09:41.506 --> 09:43.473
- Lower the capital gains tax.
- MSNBC and Bloomberg are on hold.

09:43.475 --> 09:45.175
Deregulate the financial industry.

09:45.177 --> 09:47.009
Deregulate the... deregulate everything!

09:47.011 --> 09:49.011
- Congressman.
- Thank you.

09:49.013 --> 09:51.814
Dan Egan, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this...

09:51.816 --> 09:54.183
there is no fucking way I
am going on your show!

09:54.185 --> 09:56.351
- Jonah.
- Hold for Congressman Ryan.

09:56.353 --> 09:59.021
Don't budge on the debt ceiling until you
get a private meeting with the president.

09:59.023 --> 10:03.092
You're a freshman congressman who still
uses his mother's Netflix password.

10:03.094 --> 10:05.160
<i>There's no way you're gonna
get a meeting with Montez,</i>

10:05.162 --> 10:07.229
no matter what Fyvush
Fuckhole here says.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.130
Well, Fyvush Fuckhole disagrees.

10:09.132 --> 10:10.465
We're gonna hold out for the meeting.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.000
I'll be in my car getting drunk.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.969
Hi, Danny. I want tickets
to a certain Broadway show

10:14.971 --> 10:17.172
that's impossible to get tickets to...

10:17.174 --> 10:19.074
"SPIDER-MAN: Turn Off the Dark."

10:19.076 --> 10:21.009
That... that show closed years ago.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.986
Hold for the congressman. I
have another offer coming.

10:22.988 --> 10:26.047
No, wait! Jonah, I will give
you the questions in advance.

10:26.049 --> 10:27.582
Fuck!

10:27.584 --> 10:29.417
Four tickets to "Spider-Man:
Turn Off the Dark"?

10:29.419 --> 10:31.753
No problemo. It'll be right
after the interview.

10:31.755 --> 10:34.255
- Best seats in the house.
- Shit! Give... no, no. Hey, Jonah.

10:34.257 --> 10:36.791
<i>Jonah, hang up on him.
Greg is basic cable...</i>

10:36.793 --> 10:38.158
Are these from Trader Joe's?
They're delicious.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.293
Oh, no, they're from Costco.

10:39.295 --> 10:40.628
I get them in a five-gallon bucket.

10:40.630 --> 10:42.029
Look, Jonah, just tell me what you want.

10:42.031 --> 10:43.698
I want you and I to party like we did

10:43.700 --> 10:45.032
back when we were best friends.

10:45.034 --> 10:47.602
Uh, when ex... uh... yes.

10:47.604 --> 10:48.836
Yes! Done-zo!

10:48.838 --> 10:50.705
Well, then, I guess we have a deal.

10:50.707 --> 10:54.307
You said on-air that Bruce Hornsby
was a member of the Grateful Dead.

10:54.309 --> 10:58.011
He was a touring member from '90 to '92.
He never officially joined.

10:58.013 --> 11:00.948
I wonder if we should get married
in the fall or at New Year's.

11:00.950 --> 11:03.016
- Oh, I always thought...
- I was talking to my father.

11:03.018 --> 11:05.452
CANDI: <i> Ma'am, will you be
okay with Congressman Ryan?</i>

11:05.454 --> 11:07.487
- Alone?
- She'll... what? She'll be fine!

11:07.489 --> 11:09.322
Actually, why don't you stay, Candi?

11:09.324 --> 11:11.458
Jesus Christ, it's not like
I'm gonna rape the president.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.326
- Oh!
- I'm sorry, did you just say

11:13.328 --> 11:15.762
you aren't going to rape the president?

11:15.764 --> 11:17.997
Of course I'm not. Why
would I say I would?

11:17.999 --> 11:20.833
- Why would you say you wouldn't?
- Because I wouldn't!

11:20.835 --> 11:22.802
I think maybe your people
should come in, too.

11:22.804 --> 11:24.471
- Gentlemen!
- BEN: <i> What did he do, Ma'am?</i>

11:24.473 --> 11:25.805
Nothing! I didn't do anything!

11:25.807 --> 11:27.974
Well, he threatened to
not rape the president.

11:27.976 --> 11:29.809
Yeah, that's not a threat,
that's a promise.

11:29.811 --> 11:31.177
Okay, Congressman,

11:31.179 --> 11:33.212
first of all, let me congratulate you.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.214
You have accomplished more in one month

11:35.216 --> 11:38.217
than most extremely stupid
people do in a lifetime.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.653
- That's very kind of you to say, Ma'am.
- Shut the fuck up.

11:40.655 --> 11:42.255
<i>This is my final offer, all right?</i>

11:42.257 --> 11:44.256
Tell Tanz he can have his deregulation

11:44.258 --> 11:45.791
of the payday loan industry,

11:45.793 --> 11:48.994
tripling of the private
prison tax incentives...

11:48.996 --> 11:50.629
Nice.

11:50.631 --> 11:52.898
And the sentencing reform
rollbacks for the mentally ill.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.733
And you'll get rid of
Daylight Savings Time?

11:54.735 --> 11:55.967
- <i>Oh, my...</i>
- Saving.

11:55.969 --> 11:56.969
I cannot do that.

11:56.970 --> 11:58.671
That is an impossible request.

11:58.673 --> 12:01.106
- Why, because I'm Jewish?
- Excuse me?

12:01.108 --> 12:03.508
- He's not Jewish yet, Ma'am.
- Yeah, but I only have two months left

12:03.510 --> 12:05.110
<i>of those Jiffy Jew classes.</i>

12:05.112 --> 12:06.577
And after that, it's snip, snip, snip.

12:06.579 --> 12:08.046
- Wow.
- <i>And as an almost-Jew,</i>

12:08.048 --> 12:11.116
I will not stand by with
this anti-almost-Semitism.

12:11.118 --> 12:13.885
Why don't you take it up with
the Anti-Defamation League?

12:13.887 --> 12:16.854
- The fuck is that?
- Wow! Okay.

12:16.856 --> 12:19.056
My offer's not gonna be
on the table for long.

12:19.058 --> 12:20.257
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

12:20.259 --> 12:22.993
- Wow, Gary!
- (GARY LAUGHING)

12:22.995 --> 12:25.763
- What is this crystal?
- I know!

12:25.765 --> 12:27.565
It's Vintage Baccarat.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.233
- It's really gorgeous.
- JAFFAR: <i> Selina.</i>

12:29.235 --> 12:30.802
- Hi.
- Yeah.

12:30.804 --> 12:32.670
- So, I just heard back from Quartie.
- Right, and?

12:32.672 --> 12:35.505
- He was intrigued but reluctant.
- Oh!

12:35.507 --> 12:38.042
- Why? What?
- He's one of those real good ol' boys

12:38.044 --> 12:40.010
and he thinks that you're
a little Upper East Side.

12:40.012 --> 12:41.745
Are you kidding me? Me?

12:41.747 --> 12:44.215
- Yeah. You know, like a snob.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

12:44.217 --> 12:46.616
Well, like Eva Gabor in "Green Acres."

12:46.618 --> 12:48.285
You had "Green Acres" in Qatar?

12:48.287 --> 12:50.487
Oh, yes, but they censored all
the scenes with Arnold Ziffel.

12:50.489 --> 12:52.055
You know, I'm technically
from the South.

12:52.057 --> 12:54.090
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, Maryland had slaves.

12:54.092 --> 12:55.625
They just didn't secede.

12:55.627 --> 12:57.594
- So, they had it both ways?
- Like Gary's dad.

12:57.596 --> 12:59.095
You know what, Gary?

12:59.097 --> 13:01.465
Can we invite Quartie to your party?

13:01.467 --> 13:04.334
- Ooh, that's a good idea.
- Give the good ol' boy a good ol' time?

13:04.336 --> 13:06.970
It's kind of a sit-down dinner, so.

13:06.972 --> 13:09.005
- Yeah, but, I mean...
- Who cares?

13:09.007 --> 13:10.439
- BOTH: Yeah.
- Party on.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.640
- Great!
- Okay!

13:11.642 --> 13:14.344
I'll show that oil-splatted cow-fucker

13:14.346 --> 13:16.212
that I'm open-minded and nonjudgmental.

13:16.214 --> 13:17.680
- I love it.
- (CHUCKLES)

13:17.682 --> 13:19.515
SELINA: <i>Hey, Gary? (CLEARS THROAT)</i>

13:19.517 --> 13:24.052
I'm wondering if a sit-down dinner
is a little stuffy these days.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.721
What? No.

13:25.723 --> 13:28.791
- Well...
- Maybe.

13:28.793 --> 13:30.225
I wanna look at the menu.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.529
And I gotta say I'm not
sure this crystal is right.

13:33.531 --> 13:35.998
- I think it's a little elitist.
- I know!

13:36.000 --> 13:37.933
- But not in a good way.
- Oh.

13:37.935 --> 13:39.401
- Yeah, let's get rid of it.
- Oh.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.870
But make a mental note of
exactly what this pattern is

13:41.872 --> 13:43.838
'cause maybe we'll rent
it for my birthday.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.408
AMY: <i> Do you know that if
30,000 more people in Alabama</i>

13:46.410 --> 13:49.717
had gone to the polls instead of smoking
off-brand cigarettes

13:49.886 --> 13:52.480
off-brand cigarettes through their neck
holes at riverboat casino slot machines,

13:52.482 --> 13:54.449
we would be working at the
White House right now

13:54.451 --> 13:57.652
instead of hunting for your
diary at a fucking truck stop

13:57.654 --> 14:00.054
in which I guarantee we are the
only people who are not here

14:00.056 --> 14:02.023
to score speed or get
their assholes licked.

14:02.025 --> 14:04.426
Well, after I ate, I went
right to the bathroom

14:04.428 --> 14:06.494
because things started
loosening up, you know.

14:06.496 --> 14:08.863
- Whenever I drink coffee, usually...
- I do not need details!

14:08.865 --> 14:10.264
Okay, let's see here.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.900
- <i>Ha ha! (CLAPS HANDS)</i>
- (GASPS)

14:11.902 --> 14:13.968
- Bingo!
- Oh, God, thank you!

14:13.970 --> 14:15.736
Got it. My jacket.

14:15.738 --> 14:17.405
- And?
- And what?

14:17.407 --> 14:19.873
Oh, no diary. Fuck!

14:19.875 --> 14:23.277
Mike, I am going to choke you to
death with your urine-soaked jacket.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.180
It's not urine, okay? It's probably
just water from the urinal.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.881
- Let's go.
- Hang on.

14:27.883 --> 14:30.417
God, Jesus! I can tell you that the
diary is not in your ass crack

14:30.419 --> 14:31.785
because I have had a very good view

14:31.787 --> 14:33.687
of the strawberry fields
for the last hour.

14:33.689 --> 14:34.988
Look, I lost my belt, okay?

14:34.990 --> 14:36.957
When I went through
security at Dulles, I...

14:38.160 --> 14:39.893
I left it at security.

14:39.895 --> 14:41.194
Maybe the diary's there.

14:41.196 --> 14:43.797
Okay, now we're going to Dulles.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.832
- Can we get a quick stack of pancakes?
- No!

14:45.834 --> 14:48.501
What about my look and my makeup?

14:48.503 --> 14:50.603
I was thinking a smoky bronze eye.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.572
Okay, yeah, good.

14:52.574 --> 14:54.341
Well, well, look at you...

14:54.343 --> 14:56.576
big-shot Washington insider

14:56.578 --> 14:58.378
making like an Avon lady.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.813
- Well, the president...
- Don't interrupt me, boy!

15:00.815 --> 15:02.748
Smoky bronze eye?

15:02.750 --> 15:05.918
God, don't you know that
woman needs a pop of color?

15:05.920 --> 15:07.652
Classic red lip.

15:07.654 --> 15:09.387
- That's what she needs.
- Hmm.

15:09.389 --> 15:10.856
- Ma'am.
- How are you?

15:10.858 --> 15:12.457
Mm-hmm.

15:12.459 --> 15:14.826
You can't let your father
talk to you like that.

15:14.828 --> 15:17.863
He's always interrupting
you and insulting you.

15:17.865 --> 15:19.130
You're absolutely right. I've got to...

15:19.132 --> 15:21.533
You have to stand up
for yourself, stupid.

15:21.535 --> 15:23.668
I'm gonna tell you something that
I haven't told anybody but Mama.

15:23.670 --> 15:24.112
Dear Lord.

15:24.113 --> 15:25.436
And I'm gonna tell it
tonight at the party.

15:25.438 --> 15:27.671
When I was a kid, I was a
bit of a tomboy, okay?

15:27.673 --> 15:28.599
What?

15:28.601 --> 15:31.376
All I wanted to do was go
hunting with Judge, that's it.

15:31.378 --> 15:33.511
But he was always off with Teddy,
who was kind of the first Bobby

15:33.513 --> 15:35.713
- and all this kind of stuff.
- Yeah, I think you need to...

15:35.715 --> 15:37.415
But then on my 10th birthday,

15:37.417 --> 15:39.083
he finally took me out hunting.

15:39.085 --> 15:41.619
And then all of a sudden, this
squirrel just popped out.

15:41.621 --> 15:44.755
Wow! I squeezed my eyes
shut, I pulled the trigger.

15:44.757 --> 15:46.824
Well, the recoil just
knocked me out cold.

15:46.826 --> 15:48.225
- Oh.
- When I came to,

15:48.227 --> 15:50.561
the judge was standing
over me with a squirrel.

15:50.563 --> 15:52.630
- You were passed out?
- Yeah.

15:52.632 --> 15:54.865
- And he was standing over you?
- Yeah.

15:56.035 --> 15:57.600
Did you have your pants on?

15:57.602 --> 15:59.702
(CHUCKLES) Of course I did.
What are you talking about?

15:59.704 --> 16:01.804
But listen, what the judge doesn't know

16:01.806 --> 16:03.940
is that when I was lying
down, I kind of saw

16:03.942 --> 16:06.009
that he pulled the squirrel
out of his pocket.

16:06.011 --> 16:07.644
I didn't hit anything.

16:07.646 --> 16:09.179
He just wanted me to feel like a man.

16:09.181 --> 16:11.148
He had a dead animal in his
pocket the whole time?

16:11.150 --> 16:12.382
And you know what I did with it?

16:12.384 --> 16:14.383
I skinned it and I made a fur vest

16:14.385 --> 16:16.252
and matching boots for my G.I. Joe doll.

16:16.254 --> 16:17.820
Bam, sucker!

16:17.822 --> 16:19.055
- Neat.

- Yeah.

16:20.859 --> 16:22.859
Mike and Amy texted that they had to
head up to the National Archives.

16:22.861 --> 16:25.127
Okay. Richard, what do you
know about jug bands?

16:25.129 --> 16:27.496
- Everything.
- Ugh, what would I do without you?

16:27.498 --> 16:29.265
Well, vice versa, Ma'am, so.

16:29.267 --> 16:30.732
I will tell you one thing...

16:30.734 --> 16:32.234
I think Judge was right
about the lip color.

16:32.236 --> 16:33.869
- He always is.
- Yeah.

16:33.871 --> 16:36.138
BEN: <i>Jonah, you have to
take the Montez deal.</i>

16:36.140 --> 16:37.773
I never thought you'd
last more than a week,

16:37.775 --> 16:40.309
but right now, you could piss
on every grave in Arlington

16:40.311 --> 16:42.378
and still get reelected in November.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.213

16:44.215 --> 16:47.983
<i>Just take the deal and you
could be governor or senator</i>

16:47.985 --> 16:50.151

Thank you for your input.
It's very much appreciated.

16:53.090 --> 16:54.823
You can clean out your office.

16:54.825 --> 16:56.658
I don't have an office. I
share a desk with Kent.

16:56.660 --> 16:58.493
Well, then you can clean
out your half-desk.

16:58.495 --> 16:59.995

- You're fired.

16:59.997 --> 17:01.362
- Okay.
- All right.

- Cafferty.

17:04.101 --> 17:05.200
Yeah.

17:06.803 --> 17:09.404
- Am I fired, too, or...?
- No, no.

17:09.406 --> 17:10.771

17:10.772 --> 17:12.373
Quartie's gonna love this. Yeah.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.708
Ma'am, this doesn't seem right.

17:13.710 --> 17:15.310
- GARY: <i> No.</i>
- Yeah, let's lose it.

17:15.311 --> 17:17.744
- All right, losing the flag.
- No, no, no, the birthday sign.

17:17.747 --> 17:19.847
- Oh.
- JAFFAR: <i> Selina, look who I found.</i>

17:19.848 --> 17:21.949
- Who are all these people?
- Your guests!

17:21.951 --> 17:23.217
- Hello!
- Madam President,

17:23.219 --> 17:25.252
let me introduce you to Quartie Sturges.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.553
Quartie, President Meyer.

17:26.555 --> 17:27.954
You need to call me Selina.

17:27.957 --> 17:29.556
- Okay?
- All right, Selina.

17:29.558 --> 17:32.159
It is so nice to see you south
of the Mason-Dixon line

17:32.161 --> 17:34.662
without your campaign bus behind you.

17:34.664 --> 17:36.396

17:36.398 --> 17:40.334
You know, President Hughes said
the nicest things about you.

17:40.336 --> 17:42.769
Oh, my goodness, I wish I
could say the same thing.

17:45.341 --> 17:47.608
- We need a drink.
- (CHUCKLES)

17:47.610 --> 17:50.310
- I'm seven years sober, Ma'am.
- Uh-oh!

17:50.312 --> 17:52.078
You know, my mother was an alcoholic.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.579
She was a real mean drunk.

17:53.581 --> 17:55.348
Are you mean when you drink?

18:00.922 --> 18:03.589
It's only got four wheels and there's
no fucking hot tub in the back.

18:03.591 --> 18:06.693
Just get in the car before
someone sees us, Malcolm No-Sex.

18:06.695 --> 18:07.927
- It's all right, playa.
- Okay, fine.

18:07.929 --> 18:09.328
- Damn.
- Yeah.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.330
We're gonna fuck bitches

Actually, I'm just kidding.
I got engaged.

18:12.767 --> 18:14.367
- Did you hear that?
- Is she a foreigner?

18:14.369 --> 18:15.701
No, just Jewish.

18:15.703 --> 18:18.971
Oh, what's up now? 9-11, bitches!

18:18.973 --> 18:21.641

Okay? I think you keep forgetting that

oil spill of yours in the Gulf.

18:41.896 --> 18:45.363

- Okay, okay. Good, good.

18:45.365 --> 18:48.300

- Mm-hmm.

18:49.403 --> 18:51.002
Hey, Brian. Brian, Beth!

Where you guys going? You're
the only people I know left.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.241
We're just uncomfortable around
so many Confederate flags.

18:56.243 --> 18:58.276
- And the lawn jockeys.
- Sorry.

18:58.278 --> 19:01.278
- BOTH: Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.947
- Gary?
- Yeah?

19:02.949 --> 19:05.116
- Not a lot of vegetarian options.
- I know.

19:05.118 --> 19:06.417
I'm sorry, Marjorie.

Yeah. Hush up, y'all.

19:15.528 --> 19:20.997
I just wanna say a few words for
Gary Walsh's 40th birthday.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.433
- <i>(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)</i>
- Who's Gary?

19:22.435 --> 19:25.302
Like Gary, I, too, was born in the glory

19:25.304 --> 19:28.171
that is the deep south... of Maryland.

19:28.173 --> 19:31.308
So, you know, Gary and I
both have our swimming holes

19:31.310 --> 19:35.411
and our fishing holes and all the
holes you could ever possibly want.

19:35.413 --> 19:37.013
<i>Right, Quartie?</i>

19:37.015 --> 19:40.650
But I wanna tell you this
one particular story

19:40.652 --> 19:43.319
that's one of my favorite
Southern memories.

19:43.321 --> 19:47.490
It's when my daddy first
took me hunting for rabbits.

19:47.492 --> 19:50.627
And I gotta tell you, my
rifle was bigger than I was.

19:50.629 --> 19:52.662
- I was just a tiny, little thing.
- <i>(WOMAN LAUGHING)</i>

19:52.664 --> 19:57.199
But the Second Amendment certainly
did guarantee my right to use it.

19:57.201 --> 19:59.135
- Ho! Damn straight, huh?
- <i>That's right.</i>

19:59.137 --> 20:02.938
So, anyway, I aim my shotgun
at one of those rascals

20:02.940 --> 20:06.976
and, gosh darn it, the recoil
plumb knocked me on my behind.

20:06.978 --> 20:07.595
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:07.596 --> 20:09.444
I'm learning so much
about Selina tonight.

20:09.446 --> 20:11.346
- SELINA: <i>Sure enough, when I came to...</i>
- Me, too.

20:11.348 --> 20:12.815
I should update her Wikipedia page.

20:12.817 --> 20:15.584
Showed me the rabbit that I shot.

20:15.586 --> 20:17.820
<i>But what my daddy didn't know...</i>

20:17.822 --> 20:21.856
and I'm sorry if I get a little
emotional telling this story...

20:21.858 --> 20:26.261
is that I saw him pull that
dead rabbit out of his pocket.

20:26.263 --> 20:27.729
He just wanted to make his little girl

20:27.731 --> 20:31.866
as happy as a hound dog
with a horse's Johnson.

20:31.868 --> 20:33.101

20:33.103 --> 20:35.036
<i>But at any rate, happy birthday, Gary.</i>

20:35.038 --> 20:38.339
And I think the birthday boy
would like to say a few words.

20:38.341 --> 20:40.008
Would you like to say a few words, Gar?

20:40.010 --> 20:41.910
<i>Gary, you wanna come up?</i>

20:41.912 --> 20:44.512
- No.
- No? Oh!

20:44.514 --> 20:46.447
I think he's feeling a little shy,

20:46.449 --> 20:49.517
so, um, thank you all so much,

20:49.519 --> 20:51.786
and y'all enjoy the party
and have a good time.

story in the book.

a photographic memory.

- Yeah.
- Gary, I'm so sorry.

21:16.478 --> 21:18.812
- Yeah, yeah.
- We have run out of bourbon,

21:18.814 --> 21:23.016

your daddy's bourbon from his stash?

I just... I just had... I had one bite.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.833
Scrappiest underdog
in cinematic history.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.233
Congressman Ryan, welcome back.

23:24.235 --> 23:25.935
We painted the green
room green this time

23:25.937 --> 23:27.236
so there wouldn't be any confusion.

23:27.238 --> 23:28.338
Oh, perfect. Thank you, yeah.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.605
Hey, handsome.

23:29.607 --> 23:31.674
Let the record state I
did try to call you.

23:31.676 --> 23:34.344
What is the Host of
Christmas Past doing here?

23:34.346 --> 23:37.880
- Our interview. Checkers, bitch.
- Are you fucking kidding me?!

23:37.882 --> 23:39.115
Dan, you've heard the old saying,

23:39.117 --> 23:40.282
"You gotta keep your friends close

23:40.284 --> 23:41.684
and make your enemies take you out

23:41.686 --> 23:43.285
to Guy Fieri's restaurant
in Times Square."

23:43.287 --> 23:44.887
You're giving her the interview?

23:44.889 --> 23:47.490
I absolutely am because I hate
your stupid, perfect face,

23:47.492 --> 23:49.424
and when I was in high school,
I used to pretend to be sick

23:49.426 --> 23:51.794
to stay home and jerk
off to Jane McCabe.

23:51.796 --> 23:54.363
I just can't hear that story enough.

23:54.365 --> 23:56.031
- Thank you, Congressman.
- You're welcome.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.000
Dan, great to see you.
I had fun last night.

23:58.002 --> 23:59.434
- Congressman.
- It was fun.

23:59.436 --> 24:00.635
- Come on with me.
- Be right with you.

24:00.637 --> 24:02.504
Well, congratulations, Jane.

24:02.506 --> 24:04.373
- Yeah.
- You finally fucked me.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.641
In the face.

24:06.643 --> 24:08.410
AMY: <i>Do you know how expensive it is</i>

24:08.412 --> 24:10.178
to freeze your eggs?

24:10.180 --> 24:11.980
- That's why you should adopt, Amy.
- I'm not adopting.

24:11.982 --> 24:14.916
The other day, Ellen was in her
closet, eating cello bow rosin...

24:14.918 --> 24:16.684
I really don't care, Mike.

24:16.686 --> 24:18.586
- Okay, all right. Never mind.
- Just... I really don't care.

24:18.588 --> 24:21.288
- (BOTH GASP)
- (LAUGHS) Here it is!

24:22.626 --> 24:24.592
Oh, my God, my house keys!

24:24.594 --> 24:26.360
This is the luckiest day ever!

24:26.362 --> 24:28.195
- Did you guys find a belt?
- No belts.

24:28.197 --> 24:32.599
Wait, this is Leon West's diary.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.768
- What?
- (GASPS)

24:34.770 --> 24:37.104
Oh, my God, it is.

24:37.106 --> 24:39.973
So, where's yours?

24:39.975 --> 24:42.709
And the little boy with
the broken roller skates?

24:42.711 --> 24:46.279
He grew up to be Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.

24:46.281 --> 24:48.682
- Who, sadly, was assassinated.
- Mm.

24:48.684 --> 24:50.951
And now it's my pleasure to welcome back

24:50.953 --> 24:53.020
an old, old friend,

24:53.022 --> 24:55.355
<i>senior</i> correspondent Jane McCabe.

24:55.357 --> 24:58.091
If you don't already know
my first guest's name,

24:58.093 --> 25:00.594
- you've been hiding under a rock.
- Uh, it's Jonah Ryan.

25:00.596 --> 25:03.463
- Joining me this morning is Jonah Ryan.
- (STEVIE SNAPS FINGERS)

25:03.465 --> 25:05.432
Thank you, Jane, for having me in.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.300
Breaking news from Washington, DC,

25:07.302 --> 25:11.403
where an agreement has been reached
to end the government shutdown.

25:11.405 --> 25:12.571
I'm sorry, what?

25:12.573 --> 25:14.506
We go live to the White House.

25:14.508 --> 25:15.840
No, we don't. No, we...

25:15.842 --> 25:17.809
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to say

25:17.811 --> 25:20.812
that we found a way to reach
across the partisan divide

25:20.814 --> 25:22.214
and build a bridge.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.816
You've gotta be kidding me!
I did not authorize...

25:24.818 --> 25:27.852
I'd like to thank Congressman
Clarence Clark and his Libertonians.

25:27.854 --> 25:29.487
- I did not approve this!
- Thank you, Congressman.

- JONAH: <i> Start asking questions!</i>
- Oh.

25:35.562 --> 25:37.462
Ooh, beat my wife with a frying pan,

25:37.464 --> 25:39.363
it's even hotter today.

25:39.365 --> 25:41.865
Y'all, I'm sorry that Judge
couldn't be here to say goodbye.

25:41.867 --> 25:43.301
He went off this morning
on a business trip

25:43.303 --> 25:44.668
with Stewart to Key West.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.337
Ooh, I bet he went off to
one of his special holes.

25:46.339 --> 25:48.106
Hey, you two girls, how you doing?

25:48.108 --> 25:50.308
- Yeah, we just cried a lot.
- But we're stronger for it.

25:50.310 --> 25:52.577
Yeah, I'm glad we're going in
separate cars, I can tell you that.

25:52.579 --> 25:53.917
Imogene, thank you so much.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.247
Oh, you take good
care of my Gary, okay?

25:56.249 --> 25:59.349
- I want grandkids.
- Yeah, sure, you do whatever you want.

25:59.351 --> 26:01.051
Ma'am, you got a text
from Ambassador Jaffar.

26:01.053 --> 26:02.953
He said he talked to Quartie,
who said, "He took to you

26:02.955 --> 26:04.855
- like a hog to persimmons."
- Is that a good thing?

26:04.857 --> 26:07.224
- Well, they cause diarrhea in hogs.
- Oh, well...

26:07.226 --> 26:10.260
And Quartie said, "All that
hollering was a hoot,"

26:10.262 --> 26:12.129
and he wants to make a large
donation to the library.

26:12.131 --> 26:14.231
- Oh, that's fantastic!
- IMOGENE: <i> Oh, Gary,</i>

26:14.233 --> 26:16.566
it's just too long between visits.

26:16.568 --> 26:18.968
You got such a hard job.

26:18.970 --> 26:21.938
- There's so much I wanna say to you, Mama.
- Well, we just won't say it.

26:21.940 --> 26:24.073
Gary, it's 100-and-fuck degrees.
Let's go!

26:24.075 --> 26:26.510
- <i>Come on! My God in heaven.</i>
- I love you, Mama.

26:26.512 --> 26:27.810

26:30.015 --> 26:32.115
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO)</i>

26:34.352 --> 26:36.285
Are you still not talking to me?

26:37.421 --> 26:38.788
(SCOFFS)

26:38.790 --> 26:41.457
Because I'm not going
to apologize, you know?

26:41.459 --> 26:45.928
I would if I had something to
apologize for, but I don't.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.796
I certainly don't need to
apologize for anything.

26:47.798 --> 26:50.199
Okay, lookit,

26:50.201 --> 26:53.802
politicians borrow stuff all the time.

26:53.804 --> 26:56.104
- Personal stories?
- Absolutely.

26:56.106 --> 26:58.174
I mean, you should be honored

26:58.176 --> 27:02.645
that I would think your story was special
enough to even consider using it.

27:02.647 --> 27:03.872
Did you really like it?

27:03.874 --> 27:07.015
It's actually... it's like
what my daddy used to say.

27:07.017 --> 27:10.585
He used to say, "If that
story was like a horse,

27:10.587 --> 27:11.820
it'd be a unicorn.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.190
'Cause it was magical."

27:14.191 --> 27:15.657
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

27:15.659 --> 27:18.160
- That's nice.
- I did come all this way.

27:18.162 --> 27:18.895
I know.

27:18.897 --> 27:21.095
You know, like, a thousand
miles or something, so...

27:21.097 --> 27:23.631
- I know.
- I wish you'd be a little more grateful.

27:23.633 --> 27:27.635
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- That's okay. I accept your apology.

27:27.637 --> 27:31.072
- GARY: Ooh.
- What is this?

27:31.074 --> 27:32.607
It's a children's portion, too.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.008
- No.
- Yeah.

27:34.010 --> 27:36.244
No wonder you had a heart
attack when you were 39.

27:38.081 --> 27:41.148
All right, get in there.
Just tear that animal apart!

27:41.150 --> 27:42.850
Oh, my God.

27:42.852 --> 27:43.918
Mmm!

27:43.920 --> 27:46.087
- Mmm.
- Oh, yeah.

27:46.089 --> 27:49.523
- Ooh, it's kind of messy.
- Oh, I'm way ahead of you.

27:49.525 --> 27:51.025
- Mmm.
- Way ahead of you.

27:51.027 --> 27:52.492
- Mmm.
- Look at that.

27:52.494 --> 27:54.294
Thank you.

27:54.296 --> 27:56.563
- Mmm.
- Yep.

27:56.565 --> 27:57.897
There we go.

27:59.568 --> 28:02.202
Mmm.

28:02.204 --> 28:04.438
You've got to admit I
told it better, though.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.206
Yeah, you did. You did.

28:06.208 --> 28:09.343
So, I just told the senator that
that is a non-denial denial

28:09.345 --> 28:11.077
- like in "All the President's Men."

got Robert Redford.

- <i>(BUZZING CONTINUES)</i>
- Nope, not taking that one.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.120
All right, cool.

28:20.122 --> 28:22.789
I'll see you at lunch
or around the office.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.660
Fuck.
