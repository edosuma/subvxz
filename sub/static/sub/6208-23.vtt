WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:03.047
I'll get it

00:08.579 --> 00:10.779
In the name of the elders of Vandor,

00:10.780 --> 00:12.928
- prepare to die!
- What?

00:13.943 --> 00:15.311
Take this Gorgo,

00:15.346 --> 00:16.973
and this!

00:24.962 --> 00:26.710
Wait! No! I'm not Gorgo!

00:26.711 --> 00:28.055
- You're not?
- No!

00:28.088 --> 00:30.260
So this isn't the fortress of Wolfrik.

00:30.654 --> 00:32.597
No, this is one thirty-three Collins road.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.082
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:34.538 --> 00:36.009
Am I embarressed.

00:36.144 --> 00:37.464
So you're not going to kill me?

00:37.575 --> 00:38.666
No, no, no,

00:38.675 --> 00:40.389
there's been a terrible mistake.

00:40.588 --> 00:42.951
We recently merged with another hoard

00:43.457 --> 00:46.789
and interdepartmental
communications has been horrible.

00:47.141 --> 00:48.719
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.111
Oh, that's okay. It was no trouble.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.864
Believe me, I'm going to ream
those guys in despatch.

00:54.074 --> 00:55.752
Hey, you forgot your thingy.

00:57.805 --> 00:58.886
Sorry.

01:02.586 --> 01:05.586

01:24.003 --> 01:26.679
Fuelled by the flames of
vengeance and persecution,

01:26.780 --> 01:29.320
the Salem witch trials lasted a year.

01:29.355 --> 01:32.956
By the end of sixteen ninety-three,
twenty were hanged

01:32.970 --> 01:35.788
and the town had seen it's darkest days.

01:36.351 --> 01:39.434
Okay, two notes on tomorrows
field trip to historic Salem.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.816
The bus will leave Saturday
morning at eight a.m.

01:42.966 --> 01:44.756
Eight a.m. on a Saturday!

01:45.121 --> 01:46.737
That's just wrong.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.330
And pack lightly,

01:48.365 --> 01:50.814
you'll be provided with period
clothing when you arrive.

01:51.049 --> 01:55.572
The idea is for us to fully immerse ourselves
in the repressive culture of the time.

01:56.009 --> 01:57.668
Do you wanna sit next to
me on the trip tomorrow?

01:57.728 --> 01:58.819
I know all the good bus songs.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.864
- I'm not even sure I'm going.
- You're kidding,

02:01.072 --> 02:02.562
don't you wanna see where the witches lived?

02:02.602 --> 02:03.656
Big deal!

02:04.518 --> 02:05.749
Touchy.

02:07.098 --> 02:08.377
- Hey Adam.
- Hey.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.839
He is so into you.

02:15.492 --> 02:17.085
Adam's not the kind of guy who would ask

02:17.290 --> 02:18.156
a girl to do something.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.400
She has to make the first move.

02:19.435 --> 02:20.768
So when are you gonna do it?

02:20.903 --> 02:21.903
In Salem.

02:21.904 --> 02:24.584
It's the perfect exotic setting
to let Adam know I like him.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.460
Have you ever dated a baseball player before?

02:26.575 --> 02:28.850
Oh let's see, football, hockey,
soccer, lacrosse,

02:28.851 --> 02:31.035
badminton... No!

02:33.871 --> 02:35.014
What about Carl,

02:35.029 --> 02:36.069
we could invite him?

02:36.233 --> 02:38.752
Erck! He always wants
to bring his skunk familiar

02:38.995 --> 02:40.239
Hey, what's going on?

02:40.474 --> 02:43.801
We're thinking of having a little Texas
style dinner party tomorrow night.

02:43.882 --> 02:45.861
I had a hankerin' fer a seven witch chilli.

02:45.937 --> 02:47.135
It's good eatin'

02:47.136 --> 02:49.076
We'll save you some for when
you get back from your trip.

02:49.220 --> 02:51.092
Oh, I don't think I can go.

02:51.227 --> 02:52.426
- Why not?
- I'm sick

02:53.155 --> 02:54.065
See?

02:54.959 --> 02:56.099
A bed of nails,

02:56.134 --> 02:57.241
why am I like this?

02:57.276 --> 02:59.097
- Because you're a faker.
- Huh?

02:59.385 --> 03:00.960
You know, an Indian mystic,

03:00.982 --> 03:02.251
a Fakir.

03:03.018 --> 03:05.010
This is a very painful pun aunt Hilda.

03:05.341 --> 03:07.758
The point is, you're not sick.

03:08.718 --> 03:11.722
Aw! Oh! Okay, I'm not
but I've been thinking about it

03:11.735 --> 03:13.653
and Salem sounds like
a dangerous place for a witch.

03:13.664 --> 03:16.846
The Salem witch trials had
nothing to do with real witches

03:16.877 --> 03:18.635
Besides, that was three hundred years ago.

03:18.883 --> 03:20.101
There's nothing to worry about now

03:20.204 --> 03:21.853
except for over priced souvenirs.

03:21.888 --> 03:24.508
- Really?
- Go and have a good time on your field trip.

03:25.476 --> 03:28.169
<i>Eight bottles of beer on the wall,</i>

03:28.236 --> 03:30.006
<i>eight bottles of beer.</i>

03:30.310 --> 03:32.938
<i>You take one down and pass it around,</i>

03:33.131 --> 03:34.992
<i>seven bottles of beer on the wall.</i>

03:35.015 --> 03:36.401
Okay that's enough, we're here.

03:36.636 --> 03:37.921
Can't we finish the song?

03:38.136 --> 03:39.465
We were so close

03:39.479 --> 03:40.978
Sorry Harvey, no more singing,

03:41.137 --> 03:42.537
ye be puritans now.

03:42.663 --> 03:45.533
Okay, I'm going to hand out these envelopes.

03:45.668 --> 03:47.532
Which each contain a card.

03:47.567 --> 03:48.718
Don't open them yet.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.055
On each card is a role
for you to play

03:51.056 --> 03:52.194
while at Salem village.

03:52.282 --> 03:54.054
Most of the cards say 'townsperson'

03:54.089 --> 03:56.329
but one or more may say 'witch

03:56.464 --> 03:57.533
Witch!

03:57.568 --> 03:59.080
If you really play your roles

03:59.215 --> 04:01.102
we can make history come alive

04:01.337 --> 04:02.519
Open your envelopes

04:02.654 --> 04:04.273
but don't reveal your card to anyone.

04:04.538 --> 04:06.068
I'm a townsperson, what are you?

04:06.644 --> 04:07.821
Who cares?

04:07.822 --> 04:09.080
I'm not even looking.

04:17.637 --> 04:18.774
Hi everybody.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.272
What's Mr. Pool doing here?

04:20.582 --> 04:22.055
He must be one of our chaperones.

04:22.483 --> 04:23.981
What wont he do for money?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.620
Jenny, art thou chewing gum?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.353
I... art.

04:30.042 --> 04:31.178
Well, out with it.

04:31.213 --> 04:32.913
Had the puritans known chewing gum

04:32.914 --> 04:35.163
you can bet they would have been against it.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.710
Good morrow townspersons
and welcome to Salem.

04:45.311 --> 04:48.823
Over there is ye olde inn where
ye will eat and sleep

04:48.907 --> 04:51.149
and yonder is the meeting hall,

04:51.150 --> 04:52.762
where we'll discuss the towns issues.

04:52.797 --> 04:55.723
Now before we spread out
I want everyone to pick a buddy.

04:55.758 --> 04:57.429
- Buddy?
- Better be.

04:57.855 --> 04:59.166
Libby, I'll be your buddy.

04:59.179 --> 05:00.318
No, I wanna be your buddy.

05:00.615 --> 05:01.929
Be each others buddies.

05:01.993 --> 05:03.197
I have someone else in mind.

05:04.528 --> 05:05.937
You were my next choice.

05:06.338 --> 05:07.835
- Hey slugger.
- Hey.

05:08.209 --> 05:10.001
Listen Adam, I know you're shy

05:10.002 --> 05:11.424
so I'll make it easy for you.

05:12.005 --> 05:13.063
Will you be my buddy?

05:13.238 --> 05:14.425
Thanks Libby

05:14.759 --> 05:15.954
but I already asked Jenny.

05:16.389 --> 05:18.680
- What, like as a joke?
- No

05:18.756 --> 05:19.813
- Hey buddy.
- Hey.

05:19.855 --> 05:20.929
Hey Libby.

05:21.198 --> 05:22.402
Hey yourself.

05:24.919 --> 05:26.583
So does everyone have a buddy?

05:26.797 --> 05:27.894
Not me.

05:28.129 --> 05:29.784
We can take care of that,

05:30.291 --> 05:32.577
I'll be your buddy Goody Chessler.

05:33.206 --> 05:35.055
I feel like I'm falling down a well.

05:35.249 --> 05:38.460
All right, let's change our clothes
and begin our morning chores.

06:19.977 --> 06:21.066
I'm starving,

06:21.401 --> 06:22.944
I'm glad the puritans had chips.

06:23.079 --> 06:24.150
Me too.

06:24.185 --> 06:26.909
Man those chores were tougher
than baseball practice.

06:26.944 --> 06:29.379
Yeah, I'm really going to feel
that churning tomorrow.

06:29.493 --> 06:31.731
So has anyone been accused
of having a witch card?

06:31.855 --> 06:33.434
No, and I hope no one is.

06:33.469 --> 06:34.956
- Why not?
- Because..

06:35.224 --> 06:36.621
first you start looking for witches,

06:36.656 --> 06:38.355
the next thing you know
it turns into a witch hunt.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.796
Do you mind if I sit with you buddy?

06:42.153 --> 06:44.764
So, are ye all enjoying puritan life?

06:44.999 --> 06:46.270
If I'd wanted to do chores

06:46.271 --> 06:47.842
I would have stayed home this weekend.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.565
Well, life was hard then.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.400
You know it wasn't unusual for
a woman your age to be married

06:51.401 --> 06:52.743
and have a kid.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.171
Hey Jenny, can I talk to you outside?
It's important.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.083
Alone? that's forbidden.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.790
Don't worry, no harm will come of it.

07:03.745 --> 07:05.007
Do you see that!

07:05.042 --> 07:06.417
It's disgusting

07:06.772 --> 07:08.488
I can't stand this,

07:08.523 --> 07:10.548
Jenny is going to be so sorry.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.650
where are you going?

07:11.685 --> 07:14.609
To channel my anger into something productive.

07:17.910 --> 07:19.472
But before I tell you this

07:19.507 --> 07:20.962
you have to promise not to repeat it.

07:20.972 --> 07:22.353
Upon my soul.

07:22.619 --> 07:24.588
I could get put in the stocks for this but

07:24.623 --> 07:26.581
you look really cute in that outfit.

07:26.801 --> 07:28.645
Thanks, so do you.

07:32.124 --> 07:34.865
Ah-a-a-a! unless ye be married
there will be no holding of hands.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.565
eez, ye be really into this.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.144
- What was that?
- It came from the attic.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.901
Libby, what's wrong?

07:45.991 --> 07:47.210
She did this to me!

07:47.245 --> 07:48.968
Jenny's specter flew in through the window

07:49.024 --> 07:50.419
and braided my hair.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.548
- Why?
- To make me look dorky.

07:52.783 --> 07:55.132
Her spirit also threw my shoes out
the window

07:55.167 --> 07:56.382
and I'll prove it.

07:57.371 --> 08:00.172
There! See what Jenny's stupid specter
did to my shoes.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.374
I wasn't lying, that's proof.

08:02.799 --> 08:03.750
Of what?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.605
That Jenny's card says witch.

08:06.097 --> 08:08.111
That's ridiculous, Jenny's not a witch.

08:08.395 --> 08:10.178
True or false, the puritans would have taken

08:10.213 --> 08:11.595
these allegations very seriously.

08:11.663 --> 08:13.382
That's right, so as puritans

08:13.417 --> 08:14.431
you have a choice.

08:14.466 --> 08:16.591
You can either deal with the witch accusation or..

08:17.022 --> 08:18.427
go back to your chores.

08:19.344 --> 08:21.892
- I saw Jenny with the devil!
- I saw Jenny with the devil!

08:21.924 --> 08:23.387
I saw Jenny with the devil!

08:23.452 --> 08:24.980
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

08:25.015 --> 08:26.251
Hey guys, what's going on?

08:26.375 --> 08:27.663
Come on, run.

08:27.698 --> 08:29.106
Witch! Witch!

08:29.141 --> 08:31.564
Witch! Witch! Witch!

08:35.677 --> 08:36.736
What was that all about?

08:36.772 --> 08:37.850
They think you're a witch.

08:38.072 --> 08:39.717
Really? Cool.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.500
Maybe in some circumstances but not right now.

08:44.081 --> 08:46.273
So just tell me, did your card say witch?

08:46.349 --> 08:48.015
Nope, townsperson.

08:48.301 --> 08:50.016
Great. Then you're off the hook, just show it to them.

08:50.693 --> 08:52.552
I can't. I spit my gum out in it.

08:52.687 --> 08:55.310
How could you?
That's what the wrappers for!

08:55.778 --> 08:57.428
Why are you getting so worked up?

08:57.587 --> 08:59.006
Because they're persecuting you

08:59.041 --> 09:00.075
and if they can do this to you,

09:00.101 --> 09:01.370
they could do it to anyone.

09:01.405 --> 09:02.611
It's just a game.

09:02.646 --> 09:05.752
Yeah but what if you were
a witch and this wasn't a game?

09:05.762 --> 09:08.098
Goody Kelly, you're wanted in the meeting house.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.256
It's time for you trial.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.509
Why couldn't we have
just recreated thanksgiving?

09:12.361 --> 09:13.696
Let's begin the trial.

09:13.731 --> 09:15.900
Bring in the accused witch, Jennifer Kelly.

09:16.248 --> 09:18.555
Cold! Cold! She's making me cold!

09:18.635 --> 09:20.197
Cold! Cold!

09:20.780 --> 09:22.325
Oh put a sweater on!

09:23.914 --> 09:25.681
All right. Jennifer Kelly,

09:25.749 --> 09:27.096
you are accused of being a witch.

09:27.177 --> 09:28.797
- Do you confess it?
- No.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.302
But didn't your specter twist Goody Chessler hair

09:31.303 --> 09:32.360
and toss her shoes?

09:32.395 --> 09:35.295
No, I'm pretty sure my specter
was with me the whole time.

09:35.388 --> 09:36.380
Where were you?

09:36.415 --> 09:38.446
You weren't in the dining hall when Libby screamed.

09:38.456 --> 09:39.530
She was with Adam,

09:39.586 --> 09:40.880
unescorted.

09:40.915 --> 09:42.647
How unseemly.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.248
We were just talking.

09:44.283 --> 09:47.500
- About what?
-  I... can't say,

09:47.535 --> 09:49.964
- I've been sworn to secrecy.
- There are no secrets from the court.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.977
Then ask Jill if that's her real nose.

09:52.898 --> 09:55.727
Jill's nose is not on trial here.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.950
You will tell the court what you were discussing Jenny

09:57.985 --> 10:00.037
or be held in contempt.

10:00.072 --> 10:01.219
Do with me what you may,

10:01.254 --> 10:03.165
I will not betray a trust.

10:05.534 --> 10:06.546
That's enough.

10:06.581 --> 10:08.571
I'm really proud of the way you
stood up to everyone Jenny.

10:08.572 --> 10:09.653
Thanks.

10:10.079 --> 10:11.400
Did they find the key yet?

10:11.401 --> 10:12.530
No.

10:12.826 --> 10:14.593
Man, I wish I really was a witch.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.480
I'd zap open these stocks
and broomstick it outa here.

10:18.002 --> 10:19.198
Hey there's Adam.

10:19.533 --> 10:20.680
I'll go talk to him.

10:22.611 --> 10:23.989
Tis a providence you're here.

10:24.767 --> 10:25.449
Where've you been?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.259
Walking in the woods.
What happened to Jenny?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.981
She's been accused of being a witch.

10:29.016 --> 10:30.899
They've put her in the stocks
because she won't tell the court

10:30.900 --> 10:32.000
what you were talking about.

10:32.001 --> 10:33.379
Your secrets safe with me.

10:33.414 --> 10:34.627
I'll tell the court

10:34.662 --> 10:37.267
- ye will not suffer on my account.
- No don't!

10:37.302 --> 10:39.167
Besides, they would have found out Monday.

10:39.471 --> 10:40.300
We have new evidence.

10:40.413 --> 10:41.442
Adam will testify.

10:42.653 --> 10:43.720
What say ye?

10:43.887 --> 10:44.901
Mr. Pool,

10:44.902 --> 10:46.849
today at lunch I did speak with Jenny.

10:46.884 --> 10:48.698
Then what was the nature of your conversation?

10:49.327 --> 10:50.753
This is kinda hard for me but

10:51.157 --> 10:53.132
I've decided to quit baseball.

10:53.983 --> 10:54.540
What!

10:55.082 --> 10:56.484
But you're our best short stop,

10:56.519 --> 10:57.700
why would you do that?

10:57.735 --> 10:59.612
Witchcraft!
Witchcraft!

11:00.505 --> 11:01.883
No, no!

11:01.918 --> 11:03.921
I just wanted to spend more time on my studies.

11:04.056 --> 11:05.074
Jenny has witched him,

11:05.309 --> 11:07.281
she's turned a man against sport.

11:07.516 --> 11:08.420
Don't blame Jenny,

11:08.421 --> 11:10.015
blame coach. He's insane.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.579
Witchcraft! Witchcraft!

11:12.891 --> 11:13.945
Listen to yourselves.

11:13.946 --> 11:15.627
You've no proof Jenny's a witch.

11:15.628 --> 11:17.328
We have no proof she isn't either

11:17.437 --> 11:19.083
and that's good enough for me.

11:19.489 --> 11:22.188
But that's ridiculous you could say
that about anyone in this room.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.259
Aw! She's pinching me! She's pinching me!

11:26.260 --> 11:27.927
Jenny, stop pinching Libby.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.247
Not Jenny, Sabrina.

11:29.541 --> 11:31.036
What! I'm not doing anything!

11:31.071 --> 11:32.306
Yes you are. Aw!

11:36.900 --> 11:38.135
She has a witch card.

11:38.220 --> 11:39.937
Sabrina is a witch!

11:47.157 --> 11:49.405
Me? A witch? That's ridiculous.

11:49.714 --> 11:50.824
So you deny it?

11:51.645 --> 11:52.666
Bem, eu...

11:53.653 --> 11:55.614
Well I... I'm not even gonna to
dignify that with an answer.

11:55.691 --> 11:56.977
Because you're a witch.

11:57.012 --> 11:58.399
- Stop saying that!
- Witch!

11:58.400 --> 11:59.913
- Careful or I'll...
- What?

11:59.948 --> 12:01.336
Hex me? Witch!

12:01.419 --> 12:02.727
Libby, you don't know what you're talking about.

12:02.728 --> 12:04.798
I think right now the only
witch in this room is...You!

12:11.124 --> 12:12.206
What just happened?

12:13.476 --> 12:14.522
I can explain it.

12:14.523 --> 12:15.941
You can? Oh good.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.908
Yes, er I may be wearing funny clothes

12:18.083 --> 12:19.125
but I'm still a science teacher

12:19.424 --> 12:21.514
and what we just saw was ball lightning.

12:21.549 --> 12:23.747
A very rare and unusual phenomenon.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.409
Aren't we lucky?

12:25.868 --> 12:26.590
Lucky?

12:26.956 --> 12:28.227
It almost killed me!

12:28.562 --> 12:29.455
But it didn't.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.156
Let the record show, it didn't.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.797
I think that's enough for today.

12:33.059 --> 12:35.036
Tomorrow there'll be more candle making,

12:35.151 --> 12:37.749
cow milking and the trial of Sabrina.

12:40.992 --> 12:41.873
Hello aunt Zelda!

12:42.030 --> 12:44.109
Oh Sabrina, we were just sitting down to chilli.

12:44.619 --> 12:46.983
Everythingsgoingcrazy,
Idon'tlikeitanymore, youhavetocomegetme!

12:47.038 --> 12:48.140
Sabrina, slow down.

12:48.144 --> 12:50.298
You're hard enough to understand
when you're not agitated.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.665
I want you to come get me.

12:51.700 --> 12:52.744
Don't you like Salem?

12:52.779 --> 12:54.048
No, please come get me.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.528
What's going on?

12:55.841 --> 12:57.207
I'll tell you when you come get me

12:57.315 --> 12:59.180
and don't fly, drive.

12:59.215 --> 13:01.280
You two arriving on vacuums is not gonna help.

13:03.853 --> 13:05.590
We have to go, Sabrina needs us.

13:06.347 --> 13:07.344
Oh, All right.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.799
Sorry guys.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.048
Salem, you're in charge.

13:11.272 --> 13:13.940
Yes! Control, chilli,

13:14.106 --> 13:15.295
I have it all!

13:21.759 --> 13:23.550
I still don't get why you're taking off.

13:23.793 --> 13:25.242
There's just something about this town.

13:25.515 --> 13:26.845
Oh there are my aunts.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.383
Well, it's been fun.

13:28.545 --> 13:29.609
Bye Harvey.

13:31.632 --> 13:32.649
Come on, stay.

13:32.650 --> 13:34.021
I can't, sorry.

13:34.402 --> 13:35.526
See ya Monday.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.262
Hi Sabrina.

13:39.814 --> 13:41.049
We would have been here sooner

13:41.050 --> 13:44.272
but your aunt drives like
an eight hundred year old lady.

13:44.307 --> 13:45.624
Well, let's hit the road.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.087
Not so fast.

13:48.446 --> 13:49.498
What's going on?

13:49.633 --> 13:51.965
Well we've been doing this role playing game.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.149
Well that sounds like fun.

13:53.135 --> 13:54.278
No it's not.

13:54.313 --> 13:55.975
People think I got a witch card,

13:56.010 --> 13:57.990
they've accused me of being a witch.

13:58.509 --> 14:00.567
I tell you, this town needs a disco.

14:01.248 --> 14:03.061
Well do you have the witch card?

14:03.597 --> 14:05.059
I don't know, I didn't even look at mine

14:05.060 --> 14:06.615
and I have no idea where it is.

14:06.650 --> 14:09.199
This is new. mortals have been
accusing each other for centuries

14:09.200 --> 14:12.044
but I think this may be the first time
they actually got a real witch.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.487
It's supposed to be a game
but it doesn't feel like one to me.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.471
They think being a witch is a bad thing.

14:16.549 --> 14:18.048
Oh you know it isn't.

14:18.183 --> 14:20.529
So then why can't
I tell people I am one for real.

14:20.530 --> 14:21.717
It's not a good idea.

14:21.784 --> 14:24.274
Trust me, they won't understand.

14:24.309 --> 14:25.729
Well they almost found out today.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.458
I came this close to blowing my cover

14:27.573 --> 14:28.849
and if I take the stand tomorrow

14:28.950 --> 14:30.453
I can't honestly claim my innocence

14:30.514 --> 14:33.072
- and then what?
- Sabrina, calm down.

14:33.447 --> 14:35.252
There's a lesson to be learned here

14:35.397 --> 14:37.170
and you're going to stay and learn it.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.398
You're not going to take me home?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.200
No.

14:40.201 --> 14:42.204
Can you at least give me
a hint of what the lesson is?

14:42.710 --> 14:44.459
It's about accepting who you are.

14:45.012 --> 14:46.270
I don't know who I am, 

14:46.426 --> 14:47.545
I lost my card.

14:48.036 --> 14:50.250
You don't need a card to tell you who you are.

14:50.459 --> 14:52.261
- That's right.
- What's right?

14:52.333 --> 14:53.407
You know what's right,

14:53.954 --> 14:56.182
and now it's time for us
to go home to our chilli.

14:56.737 --> 14:58.444
And everything will be fine.

14:59.545 --> 15:01.981
So you drove an hour to give
me some vague platitudes?

15:02.430 --> 15:03.689
That's what being a parent is.

15:03.715 --> 15:05.235
You'll thank us when you're forty.

15:05.737 --> 15:07.382
Not if they hang me I wont.

15:10.973 --> 15:12.626
I'm really glad you stayed.

15:13.368 --> 15:16.154
How could I miss doing
chores and standing trial?

15:17.608 --> 15:19.058
Harvey, can I ask you a question?

15:19.134 --> 15:20.533
Is it about my feelings?

15:20.568 --> 15:21.688
Yes.

15:23.115 --> 15:24.289
Okay.

15:24.721 --> 15:26.461
If I were a witch would you still like me?

15:26.998 --> 15:28.586
You got the witch card!

15:28.621 --> 15:29.929
No, forget about the game.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.731
What if I were a real witch?

15:32.207 --> 15:34.393
Would you have supernatural powers?

15:34.462 --> 15:36.427
- Yep.
- How could I not like that?

15:37.050 --> 15:38.998
So, what kinda things would you do?

15:40.333 --> 15:42.263
Hmm! I might turn Libby into a goat,

15:42.298 --> 15:44.196
or change my clothes a lot,

15:44.354 --> 15:45.746
or make a giant flaun.

15:45.762 --> 15:47.016
That's all?

15:47.051 --> 15:48.371
Wouldn't you wanna do cooler stuff?

15:48.383 --> 15:49.490
Like what?

15:49.525 --> 15:52.659
Like, create a big, freaky machine
that could fly,

15:52.694 --> 15:54.616
or make... pizza, or.

15:54.751 --> 15:56.424
See? it's not so easy.

15:56.710 --> 15:57.690
Sabrina...

15:58.198 --> 15:59.668
it's time for your trial.

16:00.804 --> 16:01.959
Wish me luck.

16:02.194 --> 16:03.452
Is my bonnet on straight?

16:04.100 --> 16:05.515
- All set.
- Great.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.087
The cart will be here in a moment.

16:09.214 --> 16:12.303
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

16:17.813 --> 16:19.545
Hey, watch it with the cabbage

16:21.000 --> 16:21.950
 Itchy!

16:21.951 --> 16:23.449
Itchy! She's making us itchy

16:23.450 --> 16:25.926
- Itchy!
- Wearing wool, we're all itchy!

16:27.795 --> 16:30.738
We will continue with
the trial of Goody Spellman.

16:31.128 --> 16:33.191
Goody Chessler has accused
you of being a witch.

16:33.437 --> 16:34.597
Do you confess it?

16:34.632 --> 16:36.186
- Yep.
- You do?

16:37.001 --> 16:39.220
U-hu, I'm a witch but I lost my card,

16:39.357 --> 16:41.745
so I guess I'm not a card carrying witch.

16:42.733 --> 16:43.765
Ha-ha-ha but I am a witch.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.940
All right then er, I guess that's it.

16:46.001 --> 16:48.666
Er, just sign this confession
and we'll begin shunning you.

16:48.701 --> 16:50.633
Wait! What are you saying?

16:50.733 --> 16:51.785
You're not a witch.

16:52.118 --> 16:53.729
That was a false confession.

16:53.764 --> 16:55.998
Harvey, I have no problem
saying I'm a witch.

16:56.175 --> 16:57.618
But I know it's not true.

16:57.653 --> 16:59.787
I mean, look at this face.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.163
Is this the face of a witch?

17:01.462 --> 17:02.283
No

17:02.318 --> 17:04.958
Witches are horrible, ugly things and

17:05.102 --> 17:07.119
they melt when you throw water on them.

17:07.121 --> 17:08.354
Look!

17:09.086 --> 17:10.936
See? She's still there.

17:11.921 --> 17:13.098
Thanks Harvey,

17:13.483 --> 17:15.508
but what you just described is a stereotype.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.098
I mean how do you know witches are ugly,

17:17.099 --> 17:18.515
- have you ever seen one?
- No.

17:18.612 --> 17:21.184
Well maybe you fear witches
because you've never met any.

17:21.593 --> 17:23.098
Yes witches are different from mortals

17:23.099 --> 17:24.617
but different isn't bad.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.898
I mean maybe there are
witches among us right now

17:26.900 --> 17:29.254
but we're so close minded,
they can't tell us who they are

17:29.600 --> 17:31.051
and we're the ones missing out

17:31.311 --> 17:32.764
because if we just accepted witches

17:32.799 --> 17:34.988
maybe there'd be
a big pizza party right now.

17:35.349 --> 17:37.724
So I ask you, can we accept witches?

17:37.762 --> 17:39.847
No!

17:40.401 --> 17:41.789
No! Down with witches.

17:42.024 --> 17:43.476
Aunt Hilda was right.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.198
Order! Order!

17:48.520 --> 17:50.035
That was a lovely speech Sabrina

17:50.114 --> 17:51.719
but the bus will be here soon

17:51.754 --> 17:54.495
and it's time for the group
to pass judgement on you and Jenny.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.885
Please stand before us.

17:58.395 --> 17:59.429
Goody Kelly,

17:59.420 --> 18:00.739
you have been accused of being a witch

18:00.740 --> 18:02.871
and have been given a chance to defend yourself.

18:03.010 --> 18:05.407
Who here believes Jenny has a witch card?

18:08.635 --> 18:09.899
Take that as a yes.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.009
Oh man, is this going on my record?

18:12.500 --> 18:13.469
Goody Spellman,

18:13.470 --> 18:15.099
you have been accused of being a witch

18:15.100 --> 18:16.956
and have been given
a chance to defend yourself.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.950
Who here believes Sabrina has a witch card?

18:22.317 --> 18:23.613
The mob has spoken.

18:23.648 --> 18:25.469
The court finds Jenny guilty of being a witch

18:25.500 --> 18:28.139
but is letting Sabrina off for lack of enthusiasm.

18:29.485 --> 18:30.399
But I confessed,

18:30.400 --> 18:31.437
I confessed!

18:31.955 --> 18:33.552
Nice try Sabrina.

18:33.587 --> 18:35.202
No one can accept you're a witch.

18:35.237 --> 18:37.165
Oh they are never getting a pizza party now.

18:37.861 --> 18:39.353
So how will Jenny be punished?

18:39.473 --> 18:41.307
Libby, we're not going to punish Jenny.

18:41.668 --> 18:43.667
After what her specter put me through?

18:43.938 --> 18:45.749
Well if it makes you feel any better

18:45.750 --> 18:47.004
you can pretend we hanged her.

18:47.261 --> 18:48.486
That's not good enough.

18:48.988 --> 18:50.850
Well shouldn't she
at least have to sit in the stocks

18:50.851 --> 18:52.082
until the bus comes?

18:52.162 --> 18:53.804
I mean she's a witch 

18:53.958 --> 18:55.271
and we hate witches.

18:57.013 --> 18:58.400
Whoo, I'm cold.

18:58.435 --> 18:59.509
I'm really cold.

18:59.623 --> 19:00.875
-  Aren't you guys?
- No.

19:01.133 --> 19:02.450
Maybe I'm a little chilly.

19:04.356 --> 19:05.633
Oh! I just got a wet willy!

19:05.740 --> 19:07.463
This is witchcraft!

19:07.520 --> 19:09.220
Libby, you're taking this too far.

19:09.221 --> 19:10.941
But you have to believe me.

19:13.869 --> 19:15.791
Ahhh! There's a monkey on my shoulder!

19:16.675 --> 19:18.510
There's a monkey on my shoulder!

19:18.545 --> 19:20.037
Get it off me! Get it off me!

19:20.139 --> 19:22.459
Libby, there's no monkey on your shoulder.

19:24.628 --> 19:26.107
Okay look,

19:26.645 --> 19:28.309
I was making it up before

19:28.328 --> 19:30.999
but now I really see a monkey.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.162
Did you hear that? She was making it up.

19:33.603 --> 19:34.799
Of course I was.

19:34.901 --> 19:36.085
So you confess,

19:36.125 --> 19:38.699
you were just pretending
to be cold and itchy and dorky?

19:38.956 --> 19:42.109
Yes! Yes! Now can we please deal

19:42.162 --> 19:43.476
with the monkey on my shoulder?

19:43.561 --> 19:44.642
In a second.

19:44.942 --> 19:47.102
First, given new evidence

19:47.137 --> 19:48.792
that Libby was making stuff up

19:48.827 --> 19:51.006
we will reverse Jenny's conviction.

19:51.037 --> 19:52.719
My specter and I thank you.

19:52.803 --> 19:54.599
And for perjury Libby will spend the day

19:54.600 --> 19:56.700
in the stocks until the bus comes.

20:00.871 --> 20:01.910
Don't you see him?

20:03.059 --> 20:05.777
He's wearing a fez and saying ook! Ook! Ook!

20:11.161 --> 20:13.527
I think my mom really gonna
like this home made butter.

20:13.815 --> 20:15.574
I got a kitchen witch for my aunts.

20:15.709 --> 20:18.239
Oh no, my nose is itchy!

20:18.872 --> 20:20.370
I'll help you out there buddy.

20:21.397 --> 20:23.395
Oh, I just hit the bottom of the well.

20:24.211 --> 20:26.431
I hope you enjoyed your stay at Salem

20:26.861 --> 20:28.131
but before we get on the bus

20:28.678 --> 20:30.227
I wanna let you in an a secret.

20:30.615 --> 20:33.403
What we've been studying is not
just seventeenth century life

20:33.492 --> 20:35.039
but human nature.

20:35.153 --> 20:37.306
The persecution, the hysteria

20:37.341 --> 20:40.627
of three hundred years ago
arose again today

20:40.676 --> 20:43.284
and all it took was an idea planted in your head.

20:43.587 --> 20:46.378
The idea that someone different was among you.

20:46.436 --> 20:47.910
It wasn't just an idea,

20:48.150 --> 20:49.283
I did see a monkey.

20:49.763 --> 20:51.694
And that's what hysteria can do to you.

20:52.658 --> 20:54.698
So who did have the witch cards?

20:54.733 --> 20:56.281
No one had the witch card.

20:56.316 --> 20:58.197
Every single card said 'townsperson'

20:58.886 --> 21:00.232
I didn't create the witches,

21:01.127 --> 21:02.168
you did.

21:03.455 --> 21:05.458
Now think about that on the ride home.

21:06.564 --> 21:09.405
So, should we do the last seven
bottles or go back to ninety-nine?

21:09.440 --> 21:11.460
I don't know. I'm just going
to sleep the whole way back.

21:13.432 --> 21:15.006
So that's where my card went,

21:15.041 --> 21:16.689
my proof was here the whole time.

21:18.423 --> 21:20.070
'WITCH'

21:27.336 --> 21:28.742
A kitchen witch!

21:28.964 --> 21:30.749
Sabrina, thank you,

21:30.750 --> 21:32.034
that was very thoughtful.

21:32.154 --> 21:33.531
We'll hang it over the cauldron.

21:33.562 --> 21:34.768
I thought you'd like it.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.592
So are you glad that you stayed at Salem?

21:36.627 --> 21:39.001
Yeah. It was a pretty freaky weekend though.

21:39.441 --> 21:40.399
but you guys were right.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.212
- I learned a lesson.
- What lesson?

21:42.618 --> 21:43.836
The lesson.

21:44.171 --> 21:45.242
 Oh, that lesson.

21:46.154 --> 21:48.169
- I'll get more pie.
- Wait! don't get up.

21:51.236 --> 21:53.546
It's so good to be home and be myself again.
