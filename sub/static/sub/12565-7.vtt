it doesn't look
like you're hurting today.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.894
- [Moans] It comes, and it goes,
but it is killer.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.396
I mean it--
like someone is stabbing me

11:38.398 --> 11:40.131
from the inside of my neck.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.867
- May I take a look?

11:46.272 --> 11:50.041
[Rustling]

11:50.043 --> 11:52.844
Okay, stick out your tongue.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.423
I wonder if you might have
a foreign body

12:05.425 --> 12:06.925
in your posterior pharynx.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.327
- It's not that kind of place.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.799
- [Stammering] No, I meant, um,
a feather in your throat.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.134
- Oh.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.269
- Is it possible
you may have swallowed one?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.004
- Only every show.
[Laughs]

12:20.006 --> 12:22.240
- Well, I'd like to perform
a flexible laryngoscopy,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.909
to, uh, find and remove
any possible obstruction.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.412
Is there maybe an area here
with more privacy?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.114
- Mm, not really.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.415
- Okay, hope,
the cage is fixed.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.851
- Oh, and I have to get
back to rehearsals.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.753
Um, we have limited time
on the stage.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.121
Can I meet you later
on my lunch break?

12:36.123 --> 12:37.388
- Oh, yeah, yes,
I can come back.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.491
Our lab next door
is undergoing construction,

12:39.493 --> 12:42.260
but we'll--we'll--
we'll find a quiet place there.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.329
- Thank you.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.467
- [Giggles]
- Bye.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.937
He's just as nice
as you said.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.212
- Well, I-I'd better go.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.081
- Mm-hmm.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.221
- I forgot my bag.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.458
- Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.201
- I'm--I'm--

13:23.203 --> 13:24.402
I'm just having trouble
following--

13:24.404 --> 13:25.804
- hey, ev, you wanted
to talk to me?

13:25.806 --> 13:30.175
You're saying I need a c.O.N.
If I am an a.F.C.?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.976
That's what you're saying?

13:31.978 --> 13:34.179
Yeah, you're talking to a guy
who loves acronyms here,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.281
but o.M.F.G., man, this is--

13:36.283 --> 13:39.450
yeah, I got that one.
Thanks a lot.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.188
How important are mris?

13:43.190 --> 13:46.124
- They're up there.
- Yeah.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.093
- So Emma got home
pretty late last night.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.330
Have you met
any of her friends?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.431
- No, why?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.033
- Well, I'm just curious,
you know.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.434
All of a sudden,
she's out every night.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.203
I kind of wonder
what she's doing.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.838
- She's fine.
She's just being a kid.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.106
Remember all the crazy stuff
we got into back then?

14:02.108 --> 14:04.075
We turned out okay.
- "Crazy stuff"?

14:04.077 --> 14:07.312
Like what kind of
crazy stuff?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.080
- Like lots of things.
- Yeah?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.549
Like what?

14:11.551 --> 14:16.421
Um, car-sledding after
the first big storm of the year.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.056
- Oh, yeah.
- That was fun.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.960
- Or Dave schonoveld's party--
we set his oven on fire.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.194
That was awesome.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.864
Oh, remember
Brandon seapley's pool?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.098
- What about it?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.867
- When we went skinny-dipping.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.301
- No, I wasn't there.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.036
- Yes, you were.

14:32.038 --> 14:36.140
He was the only person
we knew who had a pool.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.942
It wasn't nearly warm enough
to go swimming yet,

14:37.944 --> 14:39.577
but his family was gone
for the weekend,

14:39.579 --> 14:41.279
so it was our only shot,
so we went for it.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.915
We jumped the fence.
- Hurry up, before someone sees.

14:43.917 --> 14:48.019
Man, I had the best cannonball,
like, the best.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.055
You taught me everything,
but I far surpassed you.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.892
Mine was the stuff of legend.
All technique.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.593
- Evan, it wasn't me.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.961
- Yes, it was, Henry.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.597
You were totally there.
Trust me.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.466
So we were in there
having a great time,

15:01.468 --> 15:02.567
then Mr. seapley came home.
- Hey!

15:02.569 --> 15:08.039
And we were laughing
our heads off,

15:08.041 --> 15:12.176
even though we were terrified
'cause the guy was crazy.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.679
That was the best day ever.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.315
- It sounds like a great day.
I wasn't there.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.318
- Of course you were.
- No, I wasn't.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.420
- Henry--

15:22.422 --> 15:23.922
whatever.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.190
Anyway, simpler times.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.492
Now I'm dealing
with government bureaucrats

15:27.494 --> 15:30.028
and their mri regulations,

15:30.030 --> 15:32.263
which is kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.198
Uh, it's not totally
what I wanted to talk about,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.334
but it's definitely
adjacent to it.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.503
- Ooh, divya's here, and we got
to get to a follow-up.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.139
Uh, can we talk tonight?
How about dinner, you know?

15:41.141 --> 15:42.473
That way,
we can really talk,

15:42.475 --> 15:45.043
catch up on everything.
- Yeah, sure.

15:45.045 --> 15:48.112
- Okay, great.
I'll see you later.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.190
- Hey, you're just in time
for my frisbee golf game.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.126
- Ah, nice.
I used to love frisbee golf.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.028
- Hey, you want to tee off?
- Uh...

16:04.030 --> 16:06.331
- Remember, we are here
for your follow-up.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.699
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.400
I'm not huge into schedules.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.736
- So all of your tests
were normal.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.438
Have you been able to taste
anything yet?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.573
- Not yet,
but I'm working on it.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.408
Hey, you thirsty?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.576
- I'll wait until happy hour.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.478
- Oh, I thought
it was happy hour.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.413
- No, it's not.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.649
Are you disoriented, or are you
just not big into clocks either?

16:24.651 --> 16:28.586
- Hard to say.
Both?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.688
- Um, can you have
a seat, please?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.290
- Mm.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.292
- Uh, can you hand me
the rapid sodium test?

16:34.294 --> 16:36.194
- Yes.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.696
- Billy, we need to check
the salt levels in your blood.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.532
- I'm getting plenty of salt.
- Yeah, I see that.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.668
Kind of looks like
you're craving it too.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.337
I need your finger, please.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.478
There you go.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.713
And just hold that down.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.115
See, cerebral salt wasting

16:57.117 --> 16:59.384
can be caused
by electrical injuries.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.553
- 124.
Normal is 135.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.057
Yours is dangerously low.
- Doesn't seem that low.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.327
Even a small variation
can be a threat.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.194
- Let's start him
on I.V. Fluids.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.696
May I have your arm?

17:12.699 --> 17:15.733
Okay.
Good.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.469
Thank you.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.704
Right there.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.739
See, the problem is
that water follows salt.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.441
So if you lose the salt
in your body,

17:23.443 --> 17:25.810
you lose the fluid
and become dehydrated.

17:25.811 --> 17:28.346
This solu-cortef should help
your fluid balance.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.481
Sorry. No more drinks
and no more salt.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.051
- [Sighs]
Buzzkill.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.352
- Part of the job description.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.654
- You're helping me out,
and I'm grateful,

17:36.656 --> 17:39.357
but you do have a serious
responsible vibe going on.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.060
- [Laughs]
He's always been like that.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.328
- You should look
into the happiness principle.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.230
- Uh, I'm sorry.
The what?

17:46.232 --> 17:48.366
- Keep an open mind.

17:48.368 --> 17:52.804
- Yeah, we buzzkills
aren't exactly known for that.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.739
- Happiness is the point
of everything.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.340
- Well,
that makes sense to me.

17:56.342 --> 17:59.210
- Didn't always make sense
to me.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.479
I have four older brothers.

18:01.481 --> 18:05.183
And they all used to be
fun, crazy, and happy.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.618
Then they grew up.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.188
One by one, I watched them
become cranky, ulcer-ridden,

18:10.190 --> 18:13.091
serious professionals.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.660
I couldn't do it.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.830
Life is too short.

18:18.832 --> 18:22.667
So I sought happiness instead,
and I found it.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.305
I can play frisbee golf,
though, right?

18:27.307 --> 18:31.642
- We need to restore your sodium
slowly and carefully.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.444
- Yeah, too much too fast
can lead

18:33.446 --> 18:35.580
to central pontine myelinolysis.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.783
- Right. Yeah.
What's that?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.451
- Acute paralysis.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.754
So, Billy,
you need to take this seriously.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.424
- All right.
You got my attention now.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.292
- Good.
Glad to hear it.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.505
- What happened?
- We had a party.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.641
- Everybody came, so there was
a lot of foot traffic out here.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.611
- Out here?
The rug was o-outside?

19:06.613 --> 19:07.912
- It's been out here
for a while--

19:07.914 --> 19:09.614
indoor-outdoor living,
you know?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.482
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.484 --> 19:16.220
Um, you probably didn't realize,
but hand-knotted rugs

19:16.222 --> 19:18.322
can take entire lifetimes
to weave.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.824
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.592
- I remember when
your grandmother bought this

19:21.594 --> 19:23.561
at auction.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.165
It dates back to the latter part
of the reign of shah tahmasp

19:27.167 --> 19:28.766
in 1565.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.334
- That's part of the problem.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.371
Aesthetically,
we're a little more modern,

19:33.373 --> 19:36.507
not that the 1560s
weren't a good time...

19:36.509 --> 19:38.309
Probably.
- [Clears throat]

19:38.311 --> 19:39.777
- Um, was this a gift
from your grandmother?

19:39.779 --> 19:40.912
- In a way.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.747
She died,
and we inherited the rug

19:42.749 --> 19:45.249
and the house,
which is nice for what it is,

19:45.251 --> 19:46.384
but eventually we want
to replace everything

19:46.386 --> 19:47.752
with more
contemporary furniture.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.521
And the rug just won't fit in.
- Mm-hmm.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.757
- I'm sure we can get you
a substantial price for it.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.592
- No, we'll store it.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.261
I just thought
we should repair it first.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.466
- Well, we know
a rug-restoration specialist

20:02.468 --> 20:05.436
whose work is like magic.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.376
- So when the mri gets here,
we've got to get two letters,

20:12.378 --> 20:13.878
one from the architect
and one from the engineer,

20:13.880 --> 20:18.282
So what I was thinking--
- inspector came this morning.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.785
- What?

20:20.787 --> 20:22.486
We got approved
before installation?

20:22.488 --> 20:26.224
- Preapproved.
Don't worry about it.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.860
Look at that.
Already open for business.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.862
- Yeah.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.664
- Do you remember what you were
doing when the pain began?

20:33.666 --> 20:39.270
I was talking to the stage
manager about the cage, and...

20:39.272 --> 20:41.606
Ugh.
It's just so awful.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.974
- I can give you something
for that.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.376
I just need to do
a culture first

20:45.378 --> 20:46.611
to check for infections.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.380
Open wide, please.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.615
- [Coughs]

20:50.617 --> 20:52.583
- All right,
this will ease the pain,

20:52.585 --> 20:55.786
as well as help with
any discomfort from the scope.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.589
[Spraying]

20:58.591 --> 21:00.358
- [Coughs]

21:00.360 --> 21:01.792
[Machine beeps]
- All right.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.362
Chin up towards me
a little bit.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.497
Thank you.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.399
And if you can just try

21:08.401 --> 21:10.001
to breathe normally
through your nose.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.470
[Door opens]

21:15.374 --> 21:18.042
- [Clears throat]
- Oh, hello, divya.

21:18.044 --> 21:21.479
This is hope.
- Nice to meet you, hope.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.381
- I don't see an obstruction.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.915
The cultures will give us
more information,

21:24.917 --> 21:26.484
so I'll let you know
when we get the results.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.020
- Thanks.
Come back next door soon.

21:29.022 --> 21:32.757
They fixed the cage,
so you'll get the full show.

21:37.896 --> 21:40.431
- She seems lovely.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.701
Evan asked me to stop by and
check the progress on the space.

21:43.703 --> 21:47.471

33:48.460 --> 33:51.194
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.196
Oh, okay, good.
She's awake.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.233
Hope.
Hope, are you okay?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.068
- I don't know.

33:58.070 --> 34:01.104
Am I?
- Yes.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.440
Her heart rate
is rebounding.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.810
- [Sighs]

34:06.812 --> 34:09.579
[Applause]

34:18.389 --> 34:20.223
- So, Billy,
your mri confirmed

34:20.225 --> 34:21.625
cervical ascending edema--

34:21.627 --> 34:23.726
swelling working its way
up your spinal cord.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.495
- It was caused
by your electrical shock.

34:25.496 --> 34:30.199
and you should see it resolve
over the next six weeks.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.369
- Okay, time to punch out.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.804
- I can stay.

34:33.806 --> 34:37.373
- No, no, no, I got you covered.
Go.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.208
Bye.
- [Sighs]

34:39.210 --> 34:40.811
- [Sighs]
- This was a close one, right?

34:40.813 --> 34:42.379
- It was a close one.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.081
- [Chuckles]

34:44.083 --> 34:46.817
[Sighs] Maybe I do need
to be more responsible.

34:46.819 --> 34:49.553
- Around electricity?
Yeah, definitely.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.221
- I can feel
that vibe again, huh?

34:51.223 --> 34:53.290
You want to tell me
to grow up?

34:53.292 --> 34:56.293
- Actually, my advice
is don't grow up too fast.

34:56.295 --> 34:59.296
- In fact, maybe I could learn
a thing or two

34:59.298 --> 35:01.198
from your happiness principle.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.666
- [Chuckles]

35:02.668 --> 35:04.234
- So how long do I have
to stay here?

35:04.236 --> 35:05.769
- Uh, three or four nights.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.571
- Uh, five is better.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.207
My next house-sitting gig
doesn't start till next week.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.374
- Ah.
- Oh, hey,

35:11.376 --> 35:14.611
can you throw them under
the planter by the back door?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.779
- Yeah, sure.
Happy to help.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.115
- Excellent.
Thank--whoa.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.549
- Yeah, maybe not.
- Thank you.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.218
- Yep.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.419
- [Crunching]

35:22.421 --> 35:24.654
Hey, I can taste it.

35:24.656 --> 35:27.791
- Nice. Enjoy.

35:30.761 --> 35:32.796
- Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.565
I almost knocked you over.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.200
I'm out of it today.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.368
- Everything all right?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.337
- Yes.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.538
Yes, I'm fine.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.473
I've just got to get home,
see sashi.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.875
I do hate leaving a patient.

35:44.877 --> 35:46.443
- How is the patient?

35:46.445 --> 35:48.612
- Patient's fine.

35:48.614 --> 35:52.749
Hank has it under control.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.218
I--

35:55.220 --> 35:56.620
I am the one out of control.

35:56.622 --> 35:59.356
Completely out of control.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.525
I really thought that going
part-time would give me balance,

36:01.527 --> 36:03.727
but I seem to be scrambling
even more.

36:03.729 --> 36:07.464
I really want to be
a good mom to sashi.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.599
She deserves everything.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.269
But I love my work too.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.237
Three years ago,
this business was my dream,

36:14.239 --> 36:16.206
and I sacrificed
so much for it.

36:16.208 --> 36:19.409
I always give 100%
to everything.

36:19.411 --> 36:24.181
But how do I give 100% to sashi
and my job all at the same time?

36:24.183 --> 36:25.782
I know,
you're going to tell me

36:25.784 --> 36:28.585
that it's
a statistical impossibility.

36:28.587 --> 36:32.722
- No, not in your case.

36:32.724 --> 36:37.594
Your parents thought that
your career would be impossible,

36:37.596 --> 36:40.830
and the doctors said that your
pregnancy would be impossible,

36:40.832 --> 36:44.201
and now you think that
managing it all is impossible.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.336
But I know you.

36:46.338 --> 36:49.839
You can handle this,
all of it.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.712
- Thank you.

36:57.448 --> 37:00.450
I needed that.
- You're welcome.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.823
- [Sighs]

37:22.773 --> 37:25.342
- Hi.
[Truck door closes]

37:25.344 --> 37:27.444
I brought some things
for hope.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.379
How is she?

37:29.381 --> 37:30.447
You can tell me now, right?

37:30.449 --> 37:31.514
She gave you permission.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.516
- Yes,
she'll be all right.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.652
- I still don't quite understand
what happened.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.454
- Hope has
glossopharyngeal neuralgia,

37:37.456 --> 37:40.924
which is caused by, uh,
compression of a nerve.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.525
- The ninth cranial nerve?

37:42.527 --> 37:44.027
- Yes.
Good memory.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.429
The surgeon will
decompress the nerve,

37:46.431 --> 37:48.665
and her pain episodes
will cease.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.735
- So no more neck injections?

37:53.904 --> 37:56.940
[Car alarm beeps]

37:56.942 --> 37:59.376
- Is that your car?

37:59.378 --> 38:00.777
- It's one of them.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.546
The other one
is being serviced.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.715
- Okay.
Wow.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.789
Thanks again.

38:15.393 --> 38:18.461
See you at the restaurant.

38:21.666 --> 38:25.869
- [Inhales sharply]
Viviana.

38:40.584 --> 38:43.653
- I got to go.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.530
So you probably noticed I didn't
say much about the hanklab

38:53.532 --> 38:55.065
at dinner last night.
- Yeah.

38:55.067 --> 38:58.101
- Yeah, that's just
because there isn't much to say.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.703
I'm all over it.
Okay?

38:59.705 --> 39:01.404
It'll be finished
by next week.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.706
You've got nothing
to worry about.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.374
- Sounds great.
I knew I could count on you.

39:04.376 --> 39:05.709
- Cool.
- Listen, I will be right back.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.877
I just got to put these keys
under some planter.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.679
- Now, whoa, wait.

39:09.681 --> 39:13.817
There's no one home?
- No.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.618
- Do they have a pool?

39:15.620 --> 39:16.753
- That's not happening.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.488
- Come on, Henry.

39:18.490 --> 39:22.058
Come on, live a little.
- No, it's a bad idea.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.128
- That's the point.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.635
[Both yelling]

39:34.939 --> 39:37.140
- This is awesome!

39:37.142 --> 39:38.775
- [Laughing]
I told you.

39:38.777 --> 39:39.776
- Whoo!

39:39.778 --> 39:41.544
- Race you to the shallow end?

39:41.546 --> 39:43.079
- Done, son.
- All right.

39:43.081 --> 39:46.716
On your mark, get set--
- yeah, yeah!

39:46.718 --> 39:48.985
- Hey.
That's cheating.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.420
You're a cheater.

39:50.422 --> 39:53.490
- Says the loser,
'cause you're a loser.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.558
- Hey, come on.
That was not fair.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.495
- Is that fair? Is that fair?
- That's called cheating.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.863
You can't even splash well.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.799
[Overlapping chatter]
Both: Whoa.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.167
- I thought the house sitter was
in the hospital.

40:04.169 --> 40:07.937
- Yeah, he is.
- So who turned the lights on?

40:07.939 --> 40:10.039
- Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.040
- Oy!

40:11.042 --> 40:13.476
- Is that Jack Piper?
- Yeah.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.678
- What's going on?
Who are you?

40:15.680 --> 40:18.948
- Uh, I'm Hank.
This is Evan.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.751
If you're not out of there
by the time I get down,

40:21.753 --> 40:23.887
I'm gonna kick
both your heads in.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.422
- Okay, okay.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.056
- Race you to the car?
- Yeah, let's race.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.893
[Indistinct chatter]

40:29.895 --> 40:33.630
- [Yells]
- Go, go, go, go, go.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.032
Go.
- Bye!

40:36.034 --> 40:38.802
- Good to meet you.
- [Shouts]

40:40.638 --> 40:41.871
- You were absolutely right
about ray.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.506
I showed him
the demilune sideboard

40:43.508 --> 40:45.542
with the tambour door,
and he loved it.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.076
- Nice choice.

40:47.078 --> 40:51.114
- It was on the bonham list.
Where's their book?

40:51.116 --> 40:53.216
- It's in my study.
I'll get it in a minute.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.785
- Oh, I'll grab it.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.929
Which one's the study?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.697
- The door on the right.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.099
Don't go digging around
up there--the place is a mess.

41:10.101 --> 41:13.169
- Yeah, I'm calling <i>hoarders.</i>

41:15.139 --> 41:17.073
- You find it?

41:17.075 --> 41:19.776
- Yeah.

41:22.012 --> 41:24.547
[Laughter]

41:24.549 --> 41:25.982
- I still can't believe
you did that.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.817
- I can't believe Jack Piper
has our clothes.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.686
- Where have you two been?

41:29.688 --> 41:31.688
I have been worried sick.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.890
And where are your clothes?

41:33.892 --> 41:35.225
- Oh, no, this is what
we wore out.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.826
This is just
kind of how we dress now.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.528
[Both laughing]
- Awesome.

41:38.530 --> 41:42.198
Um, I'm gonna go and hang out
with some friends.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.868
I assume you want a full
accounting of everyone's names

41:44.870 --> 41:47.937
and ages and 401(K) Plans.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.042
- Actually, no.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.612
I just want you to have fun.
I want you to be a teenager.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.981
- Uh, seriously?

41:57.983 --> 41:59.582
- Seriously.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.518
I mean, I'll still be
waiting up, no matter what.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.119
Look, just take pity on me,
will you?

42:03.121 --> 42:04.153
I can't help myself.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.855
- Okay, I'll consider it.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.957
- Thank you.

42:09.894 --> 42:13.196
- Wow, it's nice being
the older, wiser siblings.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.032
- Yeah, it is nicer.

42:18.702 --> 42:19.969
- So tomorrow we toilet paper
Hamptons heritage.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.237
[Cell phone chimes]
- Yeah, we do.

42:21.239 --> 42:22.906
[Overlapping chatter]

42:22.908 --> 42:25.542
- Race you to the top
of the stairs!
