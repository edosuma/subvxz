00:01.301 --> 00:04.304
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:04.338 --> 00:06.306
Gordon goes to Philadelphia,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.275
the city of brotherly love,

00:08.308 --> 00:10.444
to help a family business
in ruins.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.746
This restaurant's sucking
the life right out of me.

00:12.779 --> 00:13.847
Three sisters

00:13.881 --> 00:15.716
Who are all on the verge
of a breakdown.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.885
We have have no passion
and we have no drive,

00:17.918 --> 00:20.521
and I don't even know
how to get that back.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.122
Their niece may be the chef,

00:22.155 --> 00:23.724
But she wants out.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.158
This is not
a career choice for me.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.393
This close family

00:26.426 --> 00:27.494
is falling apart.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.896
We don't enjoy
each other's company.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.000
Losing customers by the day,

00:30.000 --> 00:30.931
Losing customers by the day,

00:30.964 --> 00:32.833
and losing hope
by the minute.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.967
We need
to pull it together.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.269
I don't know
what else to do.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.703
And when Chef Ramsay arrives,

00:36.737 --> 00:40.274
he is confronted
with a number of problems.
Tastes dreadful.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.109
Is there anything
that we don't freeze here?
No.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.610
You just served me
three-week old

00:43.644 --> 00:44.878
frozen potato skins.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.380
And the one problem

00:46.413 --> 00:47.481
He refuses to put up with

00:47.514 --> 00:48.982
is the owners'
pathetic attitudes.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.384
We don't know anything.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.685
For the first time ever,

00:51.718 --> 00:54.555
Chef Ramsay
chooses to leave.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.758
Goodbye!

00:57.791 --> 00:58.859
Find out exactly why

00:58.892 --> 01:00.000
Chef Ramsay
makes the most dramatic,

01:00.000 --> 01:00.794
Chef Ramsay
makes the most dramatic,

01:00.827 --> 01:01.795
day-one decision

01:01.828 --> 01:02.930
in Kitchen Nightmares
history.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.398
No one cares here.

01:04.431 --> 01:07.000
We're so freakin' buried
and so lost.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.469
Is failure finally
an option in Philly?

01:09.503 --> 01:11.405
This is our last hope.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.073
We're about to find out

01:13.106 --> 01:14.174
on a heart-breaking episode

01:14.207 --> 01:15.976
of Kitchen Nightmares.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.579
I don't want
to close the restaurant.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.599
Philadelphia--

01:39.632 --> 01:41.567
The city of brotherly love,

01:41.601 --> 01:44.070
the birthplace
of American independence,

01:44.103 --> 01:46.639
and home to more
than 1.4 million people.

01:46.672 --> 01:48.407
Two years ago,

01:48.441 --> 01:49.609
sister Claire and Kathryn,

01:49.642 --> 01:51.811
along with their
sister in law, Erin,

01:51.844 --> 01:54.080
decided to open
the Hot Potato Cafe

01:54.113 --> 01:57.250
in their East Philadelphia
community of Fishtown,

01:57.283 --> 01:58.951
where they all grew up.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.000
One day we just kind of
looked at each other

02:00.000 --> 02:01.187
One day we just kind of
looked at each other

02:01.188 --> 02:02.456
and said,
"Somebody should open

02:02.489 --> 02:04.024
a really good restaurant
in Fishtown."

02:04.057 --> 02:05.759
Oh, hi.
Welcome to the Hot Potato.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.427
We thought it would be
a lot of fun.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.062
People would just
walk around the corner

02:09.095 --> 02:10.530
and hang out here.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.698
How've you been?
I haven't seen you in ages.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.734
Our intention
when we opened Hot Potato

02:14.735 --> 02:17.170
was to make this
a very comfortable,

02:17.170 --> 02:19.272
casual,
friendly environment.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.207
We bring a lot
of our friends here.
Oh, thank you.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.742
Anybody new in town, we go,
"Oh, we'll take you

02:22.775 --> 02:24.444
to the new restaurant."
Oh, thank you
so much.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.712
We did the fun things.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.347
Like, oh, we're picking out
salt and pepper

02:27.380 --> 02:28.581
and all that cute stuff.

02:28.614 --> 02:30.000
I don't think you can
even wrap your mind

02:30.000 --> 02:30.149
I don't think you can
even wrap your mind

02:30.183 --> 02:31.884
around how big it is
to open a restaurant.

02:31.918 --> 02:33.386
Oh, my God.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.722
We were open
for about eight months,

02:35.755 --> 02:37.890
and we had a really,
really bad review.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.726
A local paper had come in,

02:39.759 --> 02:41.761
and they wrote an article,

02:41.794 --> 02:44.163
and they called us
spuddy hell.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.565
They ripped us apart.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.934
Like, one stroke of the pen
and you're done.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.035
There we were,

02:49.068 --> 02:50.837
sitting inside, waiting
for customers to come,

02:50.870 --> 02:51.838
and they weren't coming.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.606
That's when we,
you know,

02:53.639 --> 02:56.309
really started scraping
together some money.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.946
It's just overwhelming.

02:59.979 --> 03:00.000
The three of us
all chipped in

03:00.000 --> 03:02.648
The three of us
all chipped in

03:02.649 --> 03:03.983
pretty much
our whole life savings.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.018
Have we paid
insurance lately?

03:06.019 --> 03:09.355
No. We owe 'em, like,
$780 on the insurance.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.859
We knew that we didn't have
the experience

03:12.892 --> 03:14.027
that we needed
in that kitchen,

03:14.060 --> 03:16.062
and we couldn't afford
to hire somebody.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.930
I think it's good.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.999
What is it?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.168
Did this go out?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.402
My niece Danielle

03:22.435 --> 03:24.271
had some back-of-the-house
experience.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.608
Come on, Danielle.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.000
Even though I don't want
to be a chef for a career,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.512
Even though I don't want
to be a chef for a career,

03:32.512 --> 03:34.280
I was willing
to help her out

03:34.313 --> 03:35.648
any way I could.

03:35.681 --> 03:37.583
How's that
New York strip doing?

03:37.584 --> 03:39.052
Charbroil on the outside.
That one.

03:39.085 --> 03:41.454
I don't even know how
to charbroil on the outside.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.756
We doing anything right
around here, or what?

03:43.757 --> 03:46.359
I mean,
it's just not good.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.728
This restaurant has put
tremendous stress on the family.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.063
You know, it's hard.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.298
We don't have a clue
about what we're doing.

03:52.331 --> 03:54.901
Well, we don't.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.969
At times, it feels
like this restaurant's

03:56.970 --> 03:58.204
sucking the life
right out of me.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.171
Out of all of us.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.675
I'm just so frustrated.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.644
Somebody's got to do
something here.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.713
We're dying.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.757
I'm here in Philadelphia,

04:17.790 --> 04:19.258
the city of brotherly love,

04:19.291 --> 04:20.526
to check out a restaurant

04:20.559 --> 04:22.228
that isn't getting much love
from anybody.

04:22.261 --> 04:24.597
Now, according
to a recent review,

04:24.630 --> 04:26.232
they referred
to the Hot Potato Cafe

04:26.265 --> 04:27.733
as spuddy hell.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.000
That doesn't sound
very interesting, does it?

04:30.000 --> 04:30.302
That doesn't sound
very interesting, does it?

04:30.336 --> 04:32.838
Here we go.

04:32.872 --> 04:33.839
Hello.
Hi.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.041
How are you?

04:35.074 --> 04:36.042
Good.
How are you?

04:36.075 --> 04:37.410
Nice to see you.
I'm Claire.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.711
Claire, nice to see you,
darling.

04:38.744 --> 04:39.712
You too.

04:39.745 --> 04:40.913
With Gordon Ramsay here,

04:40.946 --> 04:42.481
it's like winning
the lottery for us.

04:42.515 --> 04:43.916
My sister, Kathy.

04:43.949 --> 04:45.351
Good to see you too.

04:45.384 --> 04:46.352
Hi. I'm Erin.

04:46.385 --> 04:47.787
Erin.
Oh, my God.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.056
Without Chef Ramsay's help,

04:50.089 --> 04:52.124
I don't think
we'd see three months.

04:52.158 --> 04:55.995
Everything that we have
has been depleted.

04:56.028 --> 04:57.063
Philadelphia Weekly

04:57.096 --> 04:58.330
is quite an influential
newspaper.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.000
It closes restaurants
and makes them successful.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.267
It closes restaurants
and makes them successful.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.401
Yeah.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.569
The review, "Spuddy hell..."

05:03.602 --> 05:05.171
It hurt. Yeah,
it hurt us big time.

05:05.204 --> 05:08.841
So what's wrong
with the restaurant?

05:08.874 --> 05:10.676
Huh?

05:10.709 --> 05:12.778
Normally when I ask owners,

05:12.812 --> 05:14.180
"What's wrong
with the restaurant?"

05:14.213 --> 05:16.849
I get some form of response.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.686
I don't feel like when people
come here and eat

05:20.719 --> 05:23.122
we get
really bad complaints.
no.

05:23.155 --> 05:25.357
People walk in, they say,
"Oh, it's really cute in here.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.759
We like the colors.
It's pretty cool."

05:26.792 --> 05:28.727
So it's not the food.
it's not the decor.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.000
We don't know.
Honestly.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.329
We don't know.
Honestly.

05:30.362 --> 05:31.630
We're at a loss.
Yeah.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.466
That makes it
ten times harder for me.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.301
I need to hear the truth.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.269
So who's the head chef?
Our niece Danielle.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.771
And that's your niece?
Yes.

05:38.804 --> 05:39.839
It's all very close knit.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.006
But how old is she?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.109
21.
21?

05:43.142 --> 05:45.678
She hasn't even had
a chance to learn yet.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.349
What's the specialty
of the house?

05:50.382 --> 05:51.383
Crab cakes.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.618
Crab cakes.

05:52.651 --> 05:53.719
Name me another.

05:53.752 --> 05:55.421
Shepherd's pie.
Shepherd's pie.

05:55.454 --> 05:57.289
Perogies.
Perogies.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.858
How weird is that?

05:58.891 --> 05:59.925
Three owners,

05:59.959 --> 06:00.000
not one of you
recommending a potato.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.961
not one of you
recommending a potato.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.367
Did we decide?
Sorry, I didn't
catch your name?

06:08.400 --> 06:09.535
I'm Brian.
Brian,
good to see you.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.036
Nice to meet you.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.938
So, um, let's start off
with the hot potato soup.

06:12.972 --> 06:14.006
All right.

06:14.039 --> 06:15.875
And what kind of
baked potatoes do you have?

06:15.908 --> 06:16.876
Spud skins.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.344
Okay.
And they're all fresh?

06:18.377 --> 06:19.745
They are fresh
when they come in.

06:19.778 --> 06:20.679
We do cut them,

06:20.713 --> 06:22.248
and then we freeze them,

06:22.281 --> 06:23.349
and then
pull them to order.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.851
So they're not fresh,
they're frozen.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.019
Correct.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.521
So the Hot Potato's
frozen potato.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.000
Or lukewarm potato.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.356
Or lukewarm potato.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.058
Depends on what shift
you come in on.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.059
Damn.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.194
That sounds intriguing.

06:35.227 --> 06:36.195
I'll go for that, please.

06:36.228 --> 06:37.763
Okay.

06:37.796 --> 06:40.032
And finally
the shepherd's pie.

06:40.065 --> 06:43.102
Thank you.
Thank you,
Brian.

06:44.603 --> 06:46.705
Oh, wow.
Is that all for him?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.641
Come on, Danielle.
The pressure's on.

06:48.674 --> 06:49.875
Potato soup.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.878
Never ever ever
have I cooked for someone

06:52.912 --> 06:54.446
of such caliber.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.814
I don't even know
what I'm doing.

06:55.848 --> 06:56.882
The hot potato soup.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.417
Hot potato soup.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.000
Thank you.
You're welcome.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.452
Thank you.
You're welcome.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.454
It's thick.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.890
It looks a mess.

07:08.961 --> 07:09.995
That is a mess.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.230
Oh, my God.

07:11.263 --> 07:13.532
He just made the most
God awful face.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.168
Holy mackerel.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.203
It's like lumps of glue.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.637
What a
embarrassment.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.641
How's the soup
there for you?

07:22.675 --> 07:25.311
It's like it's been made
out of leftover mashed potatoes.

07:25.344 --> 07:26.779
Made fresh every day?

07:26.812 --> 07:29.181
They make it probably
every other day.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.000
Every other day.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.182
Every other day.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.283
Definitely not today.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.918
This is crazy.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.053
Crazy.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.688
Thank you, Brian.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.423
Beautiful,
sunny day outside,

07:37.456 --> 07:40.192
and thick,
rich, bland stodge

07:40.226 --> 07:41.460
on the inside.

07:41.493 --> 07:42.528
What a shame.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.298
He didn't like the soup.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.299
He didn't?

07:47.333 --> 07:48.300
Bland.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.402
Bland?
Oh, my God.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.805
How's the, um, skins?

07:52.838 --> 07:55.608
They're fine.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.076
Okay.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.745
These are your
ranch and bacon potatoes.

07:59.778 --> 08:00.000
Okay, great.
Thank you.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.813
Okay, great.
Thank you.

08:00.846 --> 08:03.349
Right.
Hot potato cafe,

08:03.382 --> 08:05.618
baked potatoes.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.319
These are the frozen ones?

08:07.353 --> 08:09.488
They're the frozen ones.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.260
God, they taste dreadful.

08:14.293 --> 08:15.494
When were they baked?

08:15.527 --> 08:17.229
Probably about
three weeks ago.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.330
Three weeks ago?

08:18.364 --> 08:20.399
I know it may sound
like a stupid question,

08:20.432 --> 08:21.900
but if they were baked
three weeks ago,

08:21.934 --> 08:23.002
where's the filling gone?

08:23.035 --> 08:25.804
We use the filling
for the mashed potatoes.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.307
So my potato's
been sold already?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.875
Yes.

08:29.908 --> 08:30.000
This restaurant's called
Hot Potato Cafe.
It is.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.645
This restaurant's called
Hot Potato Cafe.
It is.

08:32.678 --> 08:33.746
Yeah,
and you just served me

08:33.779 --> 08:35.314
three-week old
frozen potato skins

08:35.347 --> 08:37.283
that have no potato inside.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.818
I feel like I'm
a potato organ donor.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.254
Strange.
Now you laugh.

08:42.288 --> 08:43.922
I'm glad you find it funny,
'cause I don't.

08:43.956 --> 08:44.923
I'm sorry.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.158
I don't want you
to be sorry.

08:46.191 --> 08:47.993
I'd be  embarrassed
if I had to serve that.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.094
Anyway. Next.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.330
All right.

08:51.363 --> 08:53.465
I'm gonna go kill myself
in the kitchen.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.701
It's hard to hear sometimes
when somebody comes in here

08:55.734 --> 08:57.169
and tells you how bad
your food sucks.

08:57.202 --> 08:59.338
It's like someone calling
your kid  ugly.

08:59.371 --> 09:00.000
It's hard to hear.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.472
It's hard to hear.

09:00.506 --> 09:01.940
Oh, my God.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.008
What was he saying?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.343
That we should be
embarrassed.

09:04.376 --> 09:06.745
We baked potatoes
three weeks ago,

09:06.779 --> 09:09.081
so he's like, "So somebody
else ate my insides?"

09:09.114 --> 09:11.216
'Cause I said we used 'em
for mashed potatoes.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.818
Oh, my God.

09:12.851 --> 09:14.353
Well, we did.

09:14.386 --> 09:16.455
I know, but when you see
you're broken down like that,

09:16.488 --> 09:18.023
it sounds God awful.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.725
I can only do so much,
you know?

09:19.758 --> 09:21.560
I've been given these recipes,

09:21.593 --> 09:23.495
and I'm just rolling with 'em,

09:23.529 --> 09:25.464
and I'm completely lost
myself.

09:25.497 --> 09:27.733
I'm gonna bring out
the shepherd's pie.

09:27.766 --> 09:30.000
Say a rosary before
you walk out the door.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.503
Say a rosary before
you walk out the door.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.539
And remember
the bowl's hot.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.140
Gotcha.

09:35.174 --> 09:37.109
And we have
the shepherd's pie.

09:37.142 --> 09:39.311
Size of that portion.

09:42.381 --> 09:43.615
I got two thirds mash,

09:43.649 --> 09:46.018
and one third of greasy,
minced lamb.

09:46.051 --> 09:48.721
That's not
the shepherd's pie I know.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.023
I'd like them
to taste that,

09:51.056 --> 09:52.558
'cause each and every
one of those owners

09:52.591 --> 09:53.859
need to know
what kind of 's

09:53.892 --> 09:55.894
being served.
you got it.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.896
My God.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.931
He wants all three of you

09:58.964 --> 10:00.000
to taste the
that you serve people.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.301
to taste the
that you serve people.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.570
All right.
Give me a spoon.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.044
That's like something you get
in the cafeteria at college.

10:12.077 --> 10:13.746
It does suck.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.214
It was like, "Hello?"

10:15.247 --> 10:17.316
I think maybe I have, like,
palate of a five-year-old

10:17.349 --> 10:18.350
or something.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.419
Obviously,
we don't know anything.

10:20.452 --> 10:21.620
After a sampling

10:21.653 --> 10:23.589
Of what has been
referred to as spuddy hell...

10:23.622 --> 10:25.090
Holy.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.193
A disappointed Chef Ramsay
heads to the kitchen

10:28.227 --> 10:30.000
to meet the owners'
21-year-old niece

10:30.000 --> 10:30.095
to meet the owners'
21-year-old niece

10:30.129 --> 10:32.231
and head chef, Danielle.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.233
How are you?
Good.
How are you?

10:34.266 --> 10:35.868
Good to see you.
You're the head chef?
Yeah.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.369
Where did you study?

10:37.403 --> 10:39.738
I actually have
no formal experience.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.640
So you're not even
a trained chef.
No, not at all.

10:43.575 --> 10:45.177
Why did you come here
as the head chef?

10:45.210 --> 10:46.845
Just to help out the family.
That's it.
Just to help out.

10:46.879 --> 10:50.749
This is not
a career choice for me.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.418
Damn.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.752
Is there anything
on that menu

10:53.786 --> 10:55.621
that you've put on
yourself personally,

10:55.654 --> 10:56.688
or is it
the kind of

10:56.722 --> 10:58.023
you inherited
before you came here?

10:58.056 --> 10:59.958
I haven't put anything
on the menu.

10:59.992 --> 11:00.000
Nothing. You just continued
processing that crap?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.728
Nothing. You just continued
processing that crap?

11:02.761 --> 11:04.296
I can't blame you entirely,

11:04.329 --> 11:06.298
because you shouldn't even
be cooking here.

11:06.331 --> 11:09.668
Yet you were forced to,
because of family reasons.

11:09.701 --> 11:11.069
But more importantly,

11:11.103 --> 11:12.604
you haven't even been
given the chance

11:12.638 --> 11:14.840
to cook or to learn how
to cook properly.

11:14.873 --> 11:16.608
He was right about
everything he said.

11:16.609 --> 11:22.047
Um, so hopefully he just
knows how to help us out.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.951
Is there anything
that we don't freeze here?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.121
No.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.122
There's your answer.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.000
The food is.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.357
The food is.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.525
God bless that critic.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.327
"Spuddy hell," right now,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.028
was being very kind,

11:36.062 --> 11:40.633
'cause the food
is dreadful.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.568
Okay.
See you later.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.569
See ya.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.671
I'll be back.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.839
Unbelievable.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.041
Here we've got a situation
with a menu

11:49.075 --> 11:51.844
passed down from a bad chef
to an inexperienced chef,

11:51.878 --> 11:52.845
and all three owners

11:52.879 --> 11:54.247
call it comfort food.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.715
It's frozen food,

11:55.748 --> 11:57.950
and I'm not comfortable
about that at all.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.018
Coming up...

11:59.051 --> 12:00.000
What I saw tonight
was embarrassing.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.753
What I saw tonight
was embarrassing.

12:00.787 --> 12:03.689
It's a Kitchen Nightmares
moment you won't forget.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.491
It's clear
you've given up.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.094
The shocking showdown
that led to this.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.429
I'm done.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.496
I'm out of here.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.764
Gordon.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.800
We're so freakin' buried
and so lost.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.035
I can't help any of you.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.144
Sensing a lack of passion

12:25.178 --> 12:27.046
By everyone in the restaurant,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.614
Gordon returns
to the Hot Potato Cafe...

12:28.648 --> 12:29.949
Aye-yi-yi.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.019
To have some private time
with each of the sisters.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.854
What's the total debt
across the board?

12:34.887 --> 12:37.623
A little over a quarter
of a million dollars.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.993
Claire, it's a  lot
of money you're backed up with.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.061
Yeah, we're never
gonna get out of this.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.363
You've never made money
in two years?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.364
We did not.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.599
We had no clue
what we were doing.

12:46.632 --> 12:47.734
Obviously.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.035
What's it done
to the three of you

12:49.068 --> 12:50.440
in comparison to what
it was like two years ago?

12:50.440 --> 12:51.804
in comparison to what
it was like two years ago?

12:51.838 --> 12:53.439
Well, I guess
two years ago

12:53.473 --> 12:54.841
we had high expectations.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.210
Everybody was happy,
giggly, getting along,

12:57.243 --> 12:58.778
and now it's just,
you know,

12:58.811 --> 13:01.748
it's just so tedious.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.483
And we don't enjoy
each other's company

13:03.516 --> 13:05.184
like we used to.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.619
How do you stay motivated?

13:06.652 --> 13:07.920
I don't think
I am motivated.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.189
I'm just trying to get
through the next day.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.190
Mm-hmm.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.625
Day by day.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.327
And hopefully just enough
to pay the bills,

13:14.360 --> 13:15.995
and enough
to just keep us afloat.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.697
I don't know
what else to do.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.499
I mean, I feel like
if we shut the door,

13:19.532 --> 13:20.440
then we're really screwed.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.467
then we're really screwed.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.769
Okay. Listen to me.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.804
Tonight I need to see

13:24.837 --> 13:26.472
a fight
in this dinner service.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.542
I need to see you
stand strong

13:29.575 --> 13:31.944
and fight for this business
by pulling on the rope.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.580
You need to find
that internal flame first.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.848
Okay.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.717
'cause I can't work
with corpses.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.585
Okay? Promise?
Promise.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.988
Do you care?
I do care.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.556
Have you given up?
Not completely.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.590
No.
Show me tonight.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.591
Okay.
Yes?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.927
All right.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.430
This is our last hope here.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.964
We need to pull it together,

13:51.998 --> 13:53.199
and, frankly,
I don't even know

13:53.232 --> 13:56.302
if we could do that,
but I would try.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.243
We have two, four, five.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.411
News has spread

14:05.445 --> 14:07.113
That Chef Ramsay
is in Philadelphia...

14:07.146 --> 14:09.215
Hi.
Welcome to the Hot Potato.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.451
And the Hot Potato Cafe
is packed.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.452
Ready to order?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.320
I'm gonna do
the crab roast.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.788
I'm gonna get
the beef burger.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.157
How would you
like that done?
Medium rare?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.426
Uh, Claire,
I want to hear you tonight.
All right.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.462
As orders pile into
the kitchen...

14:22.495 --> 14:23.863
All right,
here we go.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.031
Chef Ramsay will be focusing

14:25.064 --> 14:26.666
on the owners'
leadership skills

14:26.699 --> 14:27.667
and their willingness

14:27.700 --> 14:29.368
to fight
for their restaurant.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.837
Whose hot potato soup?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.805
Anybody have a clue?

14:32.839 --> 14:36.476
Oh, that looks like
a sloppy dog mess.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.877
Nice.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.278
Whose soup--
is this your soup?

14:39.312 --> 14:40.279
Mary.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.548
Mary,
here's your soup.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.551
I try to expedite.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.919
I try to help them out.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.554
They look--
they look freakin' raw.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.440
All right,
just give 'em to me.

14:50.440 --> 14:50.523
All right,
just give 'em to me.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.791
I don't know
if I'm doing it right.

14:51.824 --> 14:52.859
This is gonna be three.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.694
Perogies and spring rolls
together.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.695
Wait.
Fried zucchini.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.131
Now take it.
Pay attention.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.799
Got to calm down.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.235
Well, you're confusing
the hell out of us.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.369
Who's in charge?

15:03.402 --> 15:06.506
Danielle calls out
the orders, or--? No?

15:06.539 --> 15:08.908
I don't know
what's going on.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.577
There's no proper
support in there,

15:11.611 --> 15:14.614
and it's  crazy.

15:14.647 --> 15:15.615
Come on.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.885
It's like no one cares.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.253
My aunts are giving up.

15:20.286 --> 15:20.440
Now it's just slipping
through their fingers.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.388
Now it's just slipping
through their fingers.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.423
We're a  mess
back here.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.491
I need table five.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.759
It's ready.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.227
With Claire expediting

15:28.261 --> 15:30.229
Without any standards
for quality control...

15:30.263 --> 15:31.998
Can you drop
those fries in, Kath?

15:32.031 --> 15:34.934
And Kathryn standing by
and doing almost nothing...

15:34.967 --> 15:37.336
Show me you care.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.338
Danielle manages somehow

15:39.372 --> 15:41.240
to get the entrees out
on time.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.409
Hot potato chips.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.981
Ugh. That's horrible.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.440
It really is.

15:50.440 --> 15:50.616
It really is.

15:50.650 --> 15:54.120
It's, like, really doughy
and soft and undercooked.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.454
Is it good?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.724
They taste like
frozen spring rolls.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.759
This is so sad.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.327
I've come to accept it.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.628
It's sad that
I have to accept it,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.030
but it's the only thing
I know here.

16:07.366 --> 16:10.670
No one gives a.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.140
Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.108
What I saw tonight
was embarrassing.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.878
So sad to see no structure,

16:18.911 --> 16:20.440
no togetherness.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.714
no togetherness.

16:21.747 --> 16:25.851
To my amazement,
Danielle kept it together

16:25.885 --> 16:27.320
for her aunts.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.322
She just--head down,
and focused like a chef.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.523
It was really weird,

16:30.556 --> 16:31.991
because she's not even
trained as a chef,

16:32.024 --> 16:33.960
but she just took it in.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.127
Claire, Kathryn,

16:35.161 --> 16:38.064
where's the motivation?

16:38.097 --> 16:40.800
Where's the spirit?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.102
Anybody?

16:45.771 --> 16:47.807
Oh.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.440
He's right.

16:50.440 --> 16:50.776
He's right.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.478
We have no passion
and we have no drive.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.113
Everybody's so tired.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.182
I guess the fire's gone.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.784
I--I don't know
what else to do.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.253
If this was my restaurant,

17:00.286 --> 17:01.520
I'd be fighting.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.955
Every table,
every plate.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.724
You, you, and you,

17:04.757 --> 17:05.858
it's clear
you've given up.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.493
It's on your faces,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.028
in your eyes,

17:09.061 --> 17:10.029
and it's clear.

17:10.062 --> 17:12.665
Not just to me,
but to your customers.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.900
I honestly thought
when Gordon showed up,

17:14.934 --> 17:16.102
Like, he's just
gonna come in

17:16.135 --> 17:17.670
and he's gonna tell us
what's wrong

17:17.703 --> 17:19.305
and he's gonna fix us,

17:19.338 --> 17:20.440
and he's like, "No, that's not
how it's gonna go down."

17:20.440 --> 17:21.941
and he's like, "No, that's not
how it's gonna go down."

17:21.974 --> 17:22.975
I said to you
this morning

17:23.009 --> 17:25.845
one thing I need
to see is the fight,

17:25.878 --> 17:30.016
the determination,
and the grit.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.418
No one gives a.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.887
It's like zombies.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.422
I honestly don't know

17:36.455 --> 17:38.524
if you've got the passion
and the drive

17:38.557 --> 17:41.927
to take it through.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.564
I'm really sorry.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.834
I'm left with no choice.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.440
I'm done.

17:50.440 --> 17:50.803
I'm done.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.010
No. No way.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.178
No chance.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.313
I'm out of here.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.314
Going.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.182
Get the
out of here, will you?

18:03.215 --> 18:04.350
Pick up and  off.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.720
No one cares here.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.623
That.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.225
It is embarrassing.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.293
We're screwed.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.062
I didn't want to fail,

18:16.095 --> 18:19.498
but I feel like we're
way beyond that at this point.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.440
I don't want
to close the restaurant.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.568
I don't want
to close the restaurant.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.603
I can't do it.

18:34.512 --> 18:36.181
No one cares here.

18:36.214 --> 18:38.416
For the first time
in Kitchen Nightmares history,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.151
Just hours after arriving....

18:40.185 --> 18:41.353
I can't do it.

18:41.386 --> 18:44.356
Chef Ramsay has made
a drastic decision,

18:44.389 --> 18:46.658
and has decided to leave.

18:46.691 --> 18:49.895
Can we just
go talk to him?

18:49.928 --> 18:51.596
Erin.

18:56.701 --> 18:59.170
He just
went down the street.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.409
Gordon.

19:00.409 --> 19:00.805
Gordon.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.441
Gordon.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.544
This sucks.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.179
We really need your help.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.781
Can you just help us, please?

19:09.814 --> 19:12.450
Honestly, from, you know,
from my point of view,

19:12.484 --> 19:15.020
no one cares.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.655
No one cares.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.723
If you three don't care,

19:18.757 --> 19:20.992
why should I care?

19:21.026 --> 19:22.260
It's not that we don't care.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.695
I just think we need help.

19:23.728 --> 19:25.530
I don't think...

19:25.563 --> 19:26.731
I mean, we do care.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.333
We care about each other.

19:28.366 --> 19:29.868
We care about this business.

19:29.901 --> 19:30.409
We just feel like we're
so freakin' buried

19:30.409 --> 19:31.770
We just feel like we're
so freakin' buried

19:31.803 --> 19:34.005
and so lost.

19:36.908 --> 19:39.477
Please help us.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.546
It's not normal
to be in this situation

19:41.579 --> 19:45.016
and work with a family
that don't give a.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.451
I can't jump on Danielle.

19:46.484 --> 19:47.986
And she's so heart-broken.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.421
She doesn't want
to disappoint you.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.190
She's a young woman.

19:52.223 --> 19:53.525
If you weren't her aunts,

19:53.558 --> 19:55.560
she would have told you
to  off long ago.

19:55.593 --> 19:57.562
Come on.

19:57.595 --> 19:59.998
Isn't that enough
to see what you're doing?

20:00.031 --> 20:00.409
Food,

20:00.409 --> 20:01.833
Food,

20:01.866 --> 20:04.069
The  complaints...

20:04.102 --> 20:05.470
And it's like
it's all over your head.

20:05.503 --> 20:08.073
There's no feeling left
in any of you.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.575
And where's there's no
passion or heart involved,

20:10.608 --> 20:13.478
I can't give you that.

20:13.511 --> 20:16.114
It's, like, you can't see
a light at the end of a tunnel.

20:16.147 --> 20:17.248
And we weren't
always like this.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.249
We weren't.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.284
We give a.

20:19.317 --> 20:22.520
We do. Honestly.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.022
I don't think
we don't have heart.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.957
I just think we're tired.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.659
And we're frustrated.

20:27.692 --> 20:30.128
And we're out of money
and we're out of ideas,

20:30.161 --> 20:30.409
and we just don't know
what to do anymore.

20:30.409 --> 20:32.597
and we just don't know
what to do anymore.

20:32.630 --> 20:35.133
And we did whatever we could
to make this business work.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.634
We're scrubbing toilets.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.937
I thought that
was passion and heart.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.139
We really care.
We do.

20:41.172 --> 20:43.475
We just need help.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.578
We really need your help.

20:46.611 --> 20:47.746
Please help us.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.181
Don't leave.

20:53.718 --> 20:54.786
Okay.

20:54.819 --> 20:56.921
This is the most open
you've been

20:56.955 --> 20:58.923
in terms of honesty.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.392
I'm not here to blow smoke
up your ass.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.427
You asked me to come here
and help you.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.763
I can't help any of you

21:04.796 --> 21:07.032
if you're not gonna start
helping yourselves.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.567
Philadelphia.
Look at it. Down there.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.202
That city center down there

21:11.236 --> 21:13.471
needs to know
there's a heartbeat

21:13.505 --> 21:16.641
inside the Hot Potato Cafe.

21:16.674 --> 21:18.109
And there's barely a pulse

21:18.143 --> 21:20.245
between all three of you.

21:20.278 --> 21:21.279
Are you committed?

21:21.312 --> 21:22.347
We are.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.581
Yes.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.582
I need to see it.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.885
I need to see it quickly.

21:26.918 --> 21:29.054
You've got to seriously
snap out of it

21:29.087 --> 21:30.409
and fight for this.

21:30.409 --> 21:31.423
and fight for this.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.224
It has to come from us.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.960
It has to come.
You're exactly right.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.029
We'll do whatever it takes.

21:38.063 --> 21:42.734
I am 100% committed
to all three of you.

21:42.767 --> 21:44.169
In return,

21:44.202 --> 21:47.405
you've got to be
200% committed

21:47.439 --> 21:49.474
to what I'm doing.

21:49.507 --> 21:51.676
And tomorrow we turn a page,

21:51.709 --> 21:54.112
and we fight back.

21:54.145 --> 21:55.814
Okay?

21:55.847 --> 21:57.449
I'll see you in the morning.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.450
Thank you.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.251
Good night.
Good night.

22:00.285 --> 22:00.409
Holy.

22:00.409 --> 22:04.055
Holy.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.824
Very, very few people
in the world

22:05.857 --> 22:07.992
Have an opportunity to have
a world-renown chef

22:08.026 --> 22:10.795
walk into their restaurant
in the middle of Fishtown

22:10.829 --> 22:12.964
and offer us help.

22:12.997 --> 22:15.400
And, you know, we need
to pull it together.

22:18.203 --> 22:20.505
With the belief
that the three owners

22:20.538 --> 22:22.540
Are now truly committed
to their restaurant,

22:22.574 --> 22:24.642
Chef Ramsay returns to help.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.810
So, today,

22:25.844 --> 22:27.378
let's start off
with something fresh.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.513
Let's do something new.

22:28.546 --> 22:29.848
Let's do something
together.

22:29.881 --> 22:30.409
And his first order of business

22:30.409 --> 22:31.683
And his first order of business

22:31.716 --> 22:34.085
is to focus on what he thinks
Hot Potato Cafe

22:34.119 --> 22:35.487
should obviously
be known for--

22:35.520 --> 22:36.988
fresh potatoes.

22:37.021 --> 22:39.757
Let's take one potato,
boil it,gratineethem.

22:39.791 --> 22:40.992
Each of you come up
with a filling.

22:41.025 --> 22:42.927
Let's have a taste,
yeah?

22:42.961 --> 22:44.462
The best-tasting potato

22:44.496 --> 22:45.997
goes on the menu tonight.
yeah?

22:46.030 --> 22:47.098
Yes.
Yeah.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.266
Chef, excited?
Yeah.

22:48.299 --> 22:51.469
Good. Excellent.
Okay, let's go.

22:51.503 --> 22:52.904
So there's the potatoes.

22:52.937 --> 22:54.706
Whatever you wish.
Okay.

22:54.739 --> 22:56.074
But let it go, yes?
All right.

22:56.107 --> 22:57.208
Excellent.

22:57.242 --> 22:58.510
The idea behind this
is coming up

22:58.543 --> 22:59.677
with a stunning
hot potato dish

22:59.711 --> 23:00.409
that we can evolve and tweak

23:00.409 --> 23:01.779
that we can evolve and tweak

23:01.813 --> 23:03.348
and go on the menu, yeah?

23:03.381 --> 23:05.750
Why didn't we go
with fresh potatoes?

23:05.783 --> 23:07.785
So simple, so easy,
but so good.

23:07.819 --> 23:09.254
Crazy.

23:09.287 --> 23:12.323
Okay,
into the dining room.

23:12.357 --> 23:13.892
Right. Take them in.
Onto the round table.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.160
Yours looks cute.
Thank you.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.461
Okay.

23:16.494 --> 23:17.629
So what is that?

23:17.662 --> 23:19.297
It's a classic baked potato

23:19.330 --> 23:21.232
topped with butter,
sour cream, and chives.

23:21.266 --> 23:23.234
Nice. What, you served
the potato inside the skin?

23:23.268 --> 23:24.235
I did.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.236
Amazing!

23:25.270 --> 23:26.971
You just served me
three-week old

23:27.005 --> 23:28.039
frozen potato skins

23:28.072 --> 23:29.174
that have no potato inside.

23:29.207 --> 23:30.241
I'd be  embarrassed

23:30.275 --> 23:30.409
If I had to serve that.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.610
If I had to serve that.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.780
Hallelujah!

23:35.813 --> 23:37.815
Thank you very much.
It looks amazing!

23:37.849 --> 23:40.885
I think he was very
impressed by my potato.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.321
And the fact that I used
the same stuffing

23:43.354 --> 23:46.057
in the same potato
on the same day

23:46.090 --> 23:47.859
was like, oh, my God.

23:47.892 --> 23:49.127
Claire,
let's taste yours first,

23:49.160 --> 23:51.629
because one of them
is gonna go on the menu.

23:51.663 --> 23:53.831
So sour cream, chives...

23:53.865 --> 23:55.066
Butter,
salt, pepper, chives.

23:55.099 --> 23:56.834
Mm.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.436
A bit too much
of a plain Jane for me.

23:58.469 --> 23:59.470
Could have done better.
Aw.

23:59.504 --> 24:00.409
So boring.

24:00.409 --> 24:01.239
So boring.

24:01.272 --> 24:02.407
Erin, what's inside there?

24:02.440 --> 24:03.441
I scooped out the potato.

24:03.474 --> 24:04.475
Yep.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.044
I mashed it
with a little butter,

24:06.077 --> 24:07.478
little green onion.

24:07.512 --> 24:09.414
Mm-hmm.
No cheese on there.
No cheese.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.748
Yeah, it's seasoned nicely,

24:10.782 --> 24:12.283
but it just needs
a little bit more.

24:12.317 --> 24:13.718
You know, to take it
to another level.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.019
And this one was made by--?

24:15.053 --> 24:16.087
Kathryn.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.022
Kath.
Now, inside is what?

24:18.056 --> 24:19.324
Parmesan cheese,

24:19.357 --> 24:21.492
heavy cream, salt,
pepper, and garlic.

24:21.526 --> 24:22.727
One problem,
too much garlic.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.395
More, it tastes
more, more, more,

24:24.429 --> 24:25.630
but all of a sudden, bang,

24:25.663 --> 24:27.432
this powerful garlic
flavor's hitting you.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.334
This is Danielle's.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.409
Danielle's. And what's inside
there, Danielle, please?

24:30.409 --> 24:31.603
Danielle's. And what's inside
there, Danielle, please?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.004
We got
the roasted red peppers,

24:33.037 --> 24:34.372
spinach, um, some onions,

24:34.405 --> 24:35.974
and topped
with Parmesan cheese.

24:36.007 --> 24:37.909
That's really good.
Love the crispy skin.

24:37.942 --> 24:39.043
I really like that.

24:39.077 --> 24:40.378
Really good job.
I like that one.

24:40.411 --> 24:41.980
That's good, Danielle.
Thank you.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.348
Danielle's goes on the menu.

24:43.381 --> 24:44.649
Danielle, great job.
Delicious.

24:44.682 --> 24:45.617
Thank you.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.118
Chef Ramsay today

24:47.151 --> 24:49.220
Has definitely ignited
a passion inside of me.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.622
My passion for cooking.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.157
It's definitely brought it
right out of me.

24:53.191 --> 24:56.227
Pulled out
of the woodwork inside.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.295
Coming up,

24:57.328 --> 24:58.930
Danielle gets a chance
to shine.

24:58.963 --> 25:00.409
You're the chef.
Tonight you got to prove it.

25:00.409 --> 25:00.698
You're the chef.
Tonight you got to prove it.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.066
I need shepherd's pie.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.269
I have enough for these three.
That's it.

25:04.302 --> 25:06.804
But will the 21-year-old
head chef

25:06.838 --> 25:07.805
Help or hurt the future

25:07.839 --> 25:09.140
of the Hot Potato?

25:09.173 --> 25:10.508
Danielle,
you need to take control.

25:10.541 --> 25:11.643
I don't know where
you left off.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.810
Oh, my God.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.512
And you won't believe

25:14.545 --> 25:16.514
What Chef Ramsay does
to make her cry.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.023
Aside from the level
of commitment

25:25.056 --> 25:26.925
Chef Ramsay is now
getting from the owners...

25:26.958 --> 25:28.026
Okay.

25:28.059 --> 25:29.394
...He is also
starting to believe

25:29.427 --> 25:30.529
in the talented Danielle.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.164
So before dinner service,

25:32.197 --> 25:33.331
he gives her the secret

25:33.365 --> 25:35.300
of how to make
a great shepherd's pie.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.569
Foremost important part,
yeah?

25:37.602 --> 25:38.703
Minced lamb.

25:38.737 --> 25:39.738
Proper shepherd's pie

25:39.771 --> 25:40.739
has 100% lamb in there.

25:40.772 --> 25:41.907
Chef Ramsay's style,

25:41.940 --> 25:43.108
I mean,
I couldn't tear my eyes

25:43.141 --> 25:44.342
away from what
he was telling me.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.311
Really get some good
color on there, yeah?

25:46.344 --> 25:47.846
So we two thirds mince

25:47.879 --> 25:49.581
and one third vegetables,
yeah?

25:49.614 --> 25:50.419
To cook side by side
with Chef Ramsay,

25:50.419 --> 25:52.450
To cook side by side
with Chef Ramsay,

25:52.484 --> 25:53.652
is the biggest honor

25:53.685 --> 25:55.720
that I've ever had
in my life.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.323
If anyone complains
about that shepherd's pie,

25:58.356 --> 25:59.691
doesn't deserve
to be in here.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.359
Right.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.465
Oh, hi.
Welcome to the Hot Potato.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.801
How's everybody tonight?

26:09.835 --> 26:12.103
Everybody hungry?
Good.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.605
I'm really excited
for tonight.

26:13.638 --> 26:14.639
I feel like there's been

26:14.673 --> 26:16.274
new energy pumped back
into the restaurant,

26:16.308 --> 26:17.909
and we're ready
to give it a go.

26:17.943 --> 26:19.978
Tonight's dinner service menu

26:20.011 --> 26:20.419
Features two specials--

26:20.419 --> 26:21.046
Features two specials--

26:21.079 --> 26:22.581
Danielle's tasty
Potato Florentine,

26:22.614 --> 26:24.115
and the shepherd's pie.

26:26.718 --> 26:27.886
Potato Florentine?

26:27.919 --> 26:30.155
What can I get for you
this evening?

26:30.188 --> 26:31.857
Okay, Danielle.
You're the chef.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.124
Tonight
you got to prove it.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.392
Let's go.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.994
Got Potato Florentine
with spring rolls.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.329
Shepherd's pie.
Two shepherd's pie.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.597
And then two
of our special potato.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.198
How long on
the Potato Florentine?

26:40.232 --> 26:41.366
I got it.
All right.

26:41.399 --> 26:42.367
Here.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.136
Nice. Nice, nice, nice.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.404
This looks good.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.405
Three left.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.406
Wow.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.441
Three shepherd's pie.

26:49.474 --> 26:50.419
How many
Potato Florentine?

26:50.419 --> 26:50.809
How many
Potato Florentine?

26:50.842 --> 26:51.843
Two.
Table 9, table 12.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.112
That's it.
Then we're done.

26:54.145 --> 26:55.046
All right.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.215
This is
the Potato Florentine.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.186
Can't believe how quick
these specials are flying out.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.721
The specials went
like that.

27:02.754 --> 27:05.891
I made something, and, uh,
everyone wanted it.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.359
That's incredible.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.693
It's so fun.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.595
While the specials
have clearly

27:10.629 --> 27:12.063
Struck a chord
with the customers...

27:12.097 --> 27:12.998
I like it.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.866
The old menu
has hit a sour note.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.134
Aah, it's huge!

27:16.167 --> 27:18.570
It's huge.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.419
Is it me, or are
portions humongous?

27:20.419 --> 27:20.639
Is it me, or are
portions humongous?

27:20.672 --> 27:21.940
Portions are very large.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.044
Whatever you don't eat,
I'll wrap.

27:26.077 --> 27:27.946
All right. Yeah.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.081
Pasta looks low.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.383
How is there
not enough pasta?

27:31.416 --> 27:33.351
It's not even
a full bowl.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.154
Danielle's asking me
why is that not enough.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.589
Our portions
are ridiculous.

27:37.622 --> 27:40.058
I don't agree
with them at all.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.426
Way too much food.

27:41.459 --> 27:42.894
Chicken goes
on top of that?

27:42.928 --> 27:43.929
Look at that.

27:43.962 --> 27:44.930
Too much?

27:44.963 --> 27:45.997
Oh, my God.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.799
No one needs
to eat that much.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.000
I feel like
I'm hurting people

27:49.034 --> 27:50.419
putting that much food
onto a plate.

27:50.419 --> 27:50.936
putting that much food
onto a plate.

27:50.969 --> 27:53.004
It's crazy.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.073
You want
to take it home?

27:55.106 --> 27:56.007
Yeah.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.409
Thank you.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.378
You want to wrap it up?
Okay.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.580
It's an hour into
dinner service,

28:02.614 --> 28:04.649
And although many customers
have finished eating...

28:04.683 --> 28:05.650
Don't throw this out.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.718
I have to wrap it.
Thank you.

28:06.751 --> 28:07.752
No, don't throw that away.

28:07.786 --> 28:08.753
You're gonna wrap that to go.

28:08.787 --> 28:09.955
Really?
Surprise, surprise.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.022
...They have not come close

28:11.056 --> 28:12.624
to cleaning their plates.

28:12.657 --> 28:13.625
Come here.
Two seconds.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.627
And Chef Ramsay
wants to demonstrate

28:15.660 --> 28:18.063
how big the leftovers
really are.

28:18.096 --> 28:20.419
Look. That's come back
from the dining room, okay?

28:20.419 --> 28:21.399
Look. That's come back
from the dining room, okay?

28:21.433 --> 28:25.870
Look at that
on a normal-sized plate.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.706
And that's
been asked to go.

28:27.739 --> 28:31.509
That's an entree returned.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.478
So they got two meals
for the price of one.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.347
Our portions were so huge.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.548
Oh, it was such a waste.

28:36.581 --> 28:38.583
It was ridiculous.

28:38.616 --> 28:39.584
How's that?

28:39.617 --> 28:41.219
Okay, that's yours.

28:41.252 --> 28:43.188
I mean, we might as well
change this

28:43.221 --> 28:45.590
As a to-go restaurant.

28:49.861 --> 28:50.419
During tonight's dinner service,

28:50.419 --> 28:51.863
During tonight's dinner service,

28:51.896 --> 28:53.565
There were
some encouraging signs.

28:53.598 --> 28:55.133
Danielle took control
of the kitchen,

28:55.166 --> 28:57.402
and the specials
were well received.

28:57.435 --> 28:59.504
But the Hot Potato Cafe

28:59.537 --> 29:01.906
is not even close
to being out of the woods.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.308
Let's be honest.

29:03.341 --> 29:04.676
The Hot Potato Cafe

29:04.709 --> 29:06.277
needs real, significant
changes, yeah?

29:06.311 --> 29:07.612
Not tweaking the menu.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.147
Hang on a second. Yeah.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.882
Let's--let's start here.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.617
Here we go.

29:21.693 --> 29:25.630
Ten?

29:25.663 --> 29:27.465
This is how many boxes
of food

29:27.499 --> 29:28.867
people took home tonight?

29:28.900 --> 29:30.902
Oh, my God.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.810
We get the point.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.651
That's the exact number

29:46.684 --> 29:49.587
that we gave away tonight.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.419
Appetizers to go,

29:50.419 --> 29:51.356
Appetizers to go,

29:51.389 --> 29:53.291
entrees to go,

29:53.324 --> 29:55.326
and even desserts to go.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.395
And it is embarrassing.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.998
Everything I worked for
is in those boxes,

30:00.031 --> 30:01.332
an it's just
leaving this restaurant.

30:01.366 --> 30:02.667
It's ridiculous.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.370
Not only are your
food costs out of control,

30:05.403 --> 30:06.905
you're giving away double.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.540
Bang.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.509
You must be  mad.

30:11.543 --> 30:15.046
We cannot afford to do business
like this one more day.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.383
So I need all of you
to come with me.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.419
Right now.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.953
Right now.

30:21.986 --> 30:25.256
Yeah, last one out
close the door.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.759
Oh, my God.

30:34.732 --> 30:36.767
I need all of you
to come with me.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.168
Completely outraged

30:38.202 --> 30:40.638
By the amount of leftovers
taken away by customers...

30:40.671 --> 30:42.273
Last one out close the door.

30:42.306 --> 30:43.841
Chef Ramsay decides

30:43.874 --> 30:45.476
To take matters
into his own hands.

30:45.509 --> 30:46.877
Oh, my God.

30:46.910 --> 30:49.713
Tomorrow will be
a make-or-break day.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.915
We are relaunching
this restaurant

30:51.949 --> 30:53.384
like you've never ever
seen before.

30:53.417 --> 30:56.420
As a way to say good-bye
to the old reputation

30:56.453 --> 30:57.421
of the Hot Potato Cafe--

30:57.454 --> 30:58.856
the frozen potatoes,

30:58.889 --> 31:00.391
the oversized portions,

31:00.424 --> 31:03.994
we say good-bye
by doing this.

31:08.132 --> 31:09.500
Don't strain a muscle.

31:09.533 --> 31:10.801
Okay, up in the air.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.303
Goodbye.

31:12.336 --> 31:16.373
One, two, three.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.442
Oh, my God.

31:18.475 --> 31:20.277
Excellent.
Well done.

31:20.311 --> 31:21.679
Well done.
Well done.

31:21.712 --> 31:24.648
There is no need for
a plate to be that big.

31:24.682 --> 31:26.483
I never want to see a plate
like that again

31:26.517 --> 31:28.052
in my life.

31:28.085 --> 31:30.395
Well done.
Well done.

31:30.395 --> 31:32.890
Well done.
Well done.

31:32.923 --> 31:34.525
Just a couple of days ago,

31:34.558 --> 31:36.694
Gordon was ready to walk out.

31:36.727 --> 31:39.063
But now,
feeling a sense of hope,

31:39.096 --> 31:41.065
he, along with his staff,
spend the night

31:41.098 --> 31:43.000
transforming Hot Potato Cafe

31:43.033 --> 31:45.235
into a fun, contemporary,

31:45.269 --> 31:46.970
Philadelphia restaurant.

31:47.004 --> 31:48.172
Ladies, good morning.

31:48.205 --> 31:50.074
Look at our sign!

31:50.107 --> 31:51.075
Wow.

31:51.108 --> 31:52.943
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

31:52.976 --> 31:55.312
Awesome.
We're a restaurant.

31:55.346 --> 31:56.613
We're a restaurant.

31:56.647 --> 31:58.182
Doesn't that
look amazing?

31:58.215 --> 31:59.183
It's gorgeous.

31:59.216 --> 32:00.395
Is it lovely?
I love it.

32:00.395 --> 32:00.417
Is it lovely?
I love it.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.885
Ready to go inside?
Yeah.

32:01.919 --> 32:04.521
Here we go.
Come in, please.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.691
Wow!

32:07.725 --> 32:09.460
Oh, my God!

32:09.493 --> 32:10.861
Wow!
Oh, my God!

32:10.894 --> 32:12.663
A nice lounge area.

32:12.696 --> 32:14.765
Oh, this is gorgeous!

32:14.798 --> 32:16.700
The walls have been
freshly painted, clearly, yes?

32:16.734 --> 32:17.935
So what we needed.

32:17.968 --> 32:19.570
We've got some stunning
artwork on there.

32:19.603 --> 32:21.672
Oh, my God.
The colors are gorgeous.

32:21.705 --> 32:24.575
None of that horrible,
vinyl, greasy stuff.

32:24.608 --> 32:26.677
New wooden table tops.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.445
Yeah, yeah.

32:28.479 --> 32:29.413
And by the way,

32:29.446 --> 32:30.395
webstaurant, the store,

32:30.395 --> 32:31.782
webstaurant, the store,

32:31.815 --> 32:34.818
okay, they've donated
$5,000 worth

32:34.852 --> 32:37.488
of dishes,
pots, pans, China.

32:37.521 --> 32:38.722
Oh, my God.
You name it.
5,000.

32:38.756 --> 32:39.723
Thank you.

32:39.757 --> 32:40.758
It looks amazing.
Yeah.

32:40.791 --> 32:41.759
Doesn't it?

32:41.792 --> 32:45.562
This is potato heaven.

32:45.596 --> 32:46.830
Yes?

32:46.864 --> 32:49.133
I feel overwhelmed.
It's so much to take in.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.667
It's beautiful in here.

32:50.701 --> 32:51.735
I don't think it's anything

32:51.769 --> 32:53.837
I could have ever
imagined for myself.

32:53.871 --> 32:55.439
This is beyond help.

32:55.472 --> 32:56.907
This is so huge.

32:56.940 --> 32:58.308
Really.

32:58.342 --> 32:59.810
The most important change

32:59.843 --> 33:00.395
is the menu.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.245
is the menu.

33:01.278 --> 33:02.813
It oozes potatoes
clearly, yes?

33:02.846 --> 33:05.949
This menu is not a tweak.
It's an overhaul.

33:05.983 --> 33:08.152
So I've brought in

33:08.185 --> 33:10.821
a very successful,
local restaurateur, yeah?

33:10.854 --> 33:12.823
So I want someone
to mentor Danielle.

33:12.856 --> 33:14.992
Please welcome
Richard marsh.

33:15.025 --> 33:17.728
Rich, come in please, sir.

33:17.761 --> 33:19.062
Good to see you.
Come over here. Yeah?

Excellent.

33:20.097 --> 33:21.331
Okay.

33:21.365 --> 33:22.900
I've hired this man
for a month

33:22.933 --> 33:25.369
to mentor you, Danielle,

33:25.402 --> 33:27.538
to stand and support you.

33:27.571 --> 33:28.906
And he seriously,
seriously,

33:28.939 --> 33:30.395
knows his potatoes.

33:30.395 --> 33:31.842
knows his potatoes.

33:31.875 --> 33:32.843
Thank you so much.

33:32.876 --> 33:33.944
Of course.

33:33.977 --> 33:36.246
It's a helping hand.
Yes?

33:36.280 --> 33:39.983
A proper helping hand,
okay?

33:40.017 --> 33:43.420
Okay? So you're not left
in the deep end.

33:43.454 --> 33:45.989
Okay?
'cause you got it.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.224
It is a huge relief.

33:47.257 --> 33:50.828
I finally got someone
that cares.

33:50.861 --> 33:54.031
Someone that's gonna
help me out.

33:54.064 --> 33:55.232
21 years of age.

33:55.265 --> 33:56.867
I'm telling you,
you're so composed.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.303
No one's told you that.
Well done.

33:59.336 --> 34:00.395
I can finally do something.

34:00.395 --> 34:01.104
I can finally do something.

34:01.138 --> 34:04.975
I can learn--
I can learn how to do this.

34:05.008 --> 34:06.276
And do it right.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.545
Mm-hmm.

34:08.579 --> 34:10.781
And it's a great feeling.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.420
Just hours before the relaunch,

34:16.453 --> 34:17.988
Chef Ramsay shows the staff

34:18.021 --> 34:19.723
a sample of all of
the menu items,

34:19.756 --> 34:21.692
which of course
includes a number

34:21.725 --> 34:23.260
of exciting
potato appetizers,

34:23.293 --> 34:25.629
entrees, and side dishes.

34:25.662 --> 34:27.364
Start off

34:41.812 --> 34:43.013
That's it.

34:43.046 --> 34:44.581
Small, exciting,
and vibrant, yeah?

34:44.615 --> 34:45.649
Gorgeous.

34:45.682 --> 34:47.885
I'm really excited
to serve the new menu.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.454
Everything smells fresh,
looks fresh, feels fresh.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.456
It's turned
into potato heaven.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.590
There's one more surprise.

34:53.624 --> 34:55.392
Yeah.

34:55.425 --> 34:56.660
The Idaho Potato Commission

34:56.693 --> 34:59.263
have given you
for the next three months

34:59.296 --> 35:00.395
a free supply of potatoes.

35:00.395 --> 35:01.098
a free supply of potatoes.

35:01.131 --> 35:02.966
Oh, my God.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.336
Guys, come on in.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.504
Oh, my God.

35:07.538 --> 35:10.307
They're gonna save us
so much money.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.342

35:12.376 --> 35:14.011
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

35:14.044 --> 35:16.213
Thank you.
It's our pleasure.
Absolutely brilliant.

35:16.246 --> 35:17.281
For a potato restaurant

35:17.314 --> 35:19.249
with free potatoes
for three months?

35:19.283 --> 35:20.684
It's a new start.

35:24.955 --> 35:26.323
It's relaunch night,

35:26.356 --> 35:28.258
And everyone
is already nervous,

35:28.292 --> 35:30.395
but Chef Ramsay has saved
some startling news

35:30.395 --> 35:30.460
but Chef Ramsay has saved
some startling news

35:30.494 --> 35:33.130
just minutes before the doors
are about to open.

35:33.163 --> 35:34.631
Here's the bombshell.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.667
The man that destroyed
the reputation

35:36.700 --> 35:37.935
of the Hot Potato Cafe,

35:37.968 --> 35:40.237
Mr. spuddy hell himself,
is back.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.338
Oh, my God.

35:41.371 --> 35:43.040
The Philadelphia Weekly
food critic,

35:43.073 --> 35:44.641
he's back in here tonight.

35:44.675 --> 35:48.345
It doesn't get any more
serious than this.

35:48.378 --> 35:50.347
Tonight is where
it all counts.

35:50.380 --> 35:51.848
Yes.

35:51.882 --> 35:54.051
The pressure was on.
It was on all of us.

35:54.084 --> 35:55.552
Our asses are on the line,

35:55.586 --> 35:59.022
and it's unbelievable.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.395
Hi. Welcome to
the Hot Potato.

36:00.395 --> 36:01.291
Hi. Welcome to
the Hot Potato.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.759
Please come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

36:02.793 --> 36:03.760
Place looks really good.

36:03.794 --> 36:04.795
The last time I was in here,

36:04.828 --> 36:06.196
it just didn't look
this nice.

36:06.229 --> 36:07.698
This is a beautiful menu.

36:07.731 --> 36:09.032
It's amazing.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.434
You got it.

36:10.467 --> 36:12.235
All right, dining room's
getting busy.

36:12.269 --> 36:13.637
You're all gonna be
immense pressure,

36:13.670 --> 36:15.038
but if I didn't think
you could do it,

36:15.072 --> 36:16.440
you wouldn't be here.
make it work, yeah?

36:16.473 --> 36:19.343
Vocal, talking, understanding
what's going on, yes?

36:19.376 --> 36:20.744
First ticket
of the relaunch.

36:20.777 --> 36:21.745
Okay, here we go.

36:21.778 --> 36:22.746
Loud and clear.

36:22.779 --> 36:24.114
Perogies.
Good.

36:25.916 --> 36:26.883
Chorizo hash.

36:26.917 --> 36:29.019
Traditional potato,
fish sticks.

36:29.052 --> 36:30.053
That's great.

36:30.087 --> 36:30.395
Nice and vibrant
like that, yeah? Loud.

36:30.395 --> 36:31.388
Nice and vibrant
like that, yeah? Loud.

36:31.421 --> 36:32.889
Got another perogies.

36:32.923 --> 36:34.291
I'm nervous for Danielle
in the kitchen,

36:34.324 --> 36:35.459
but I know how tough she is,

36:35.492 --> 36:36.893
and if anybody
can pull it off,

36:36.927 --> 36:37.894
it's Danielle.

36:37.928 --> 36:38.929
Perogy up.

36:38.962 --> 36:40.163
Good. First ticket.
Well done.

36:40.197 --> 36:41.565
Seven minutes.
We're in business.

36:41.598 --> 36:42.599
Next.
Shepherd's pie.

36:42.633 --> 36:43.700
Can somebody take this?

36:43.734 --> 36:46.503
Table two, perogies.

36:46.536 --> 36:48.438
It's an hour into
dinner service...

36:48.472 --> 36:49.673
Here you go, guys.

36:49.706 --> 36:51.008
And with customers
impressed...

36:51.041 --> 36:52.009
Oh, my God.
That's so good.

36:52.042 --> 36:53.010
Delicious.

36:53.043 --> 36:54.444
These are really on point.

36:54.478 --> 36:56.747
...The night is off
to a solid start.

36:56.780 --> 36:59.449
But the guest who can make
or break the restaurant,

36:59.483 --> 37:00.395
the food critic
from the Philadelphia Weekly,

37:00.395 --> 37:01.618
the food critic
from the Philadelphia Weekly,

37:01.652 --> 37:03.053
has just arrived.

37:03.086 --> 37:05.255
I'm Brian McManus.
I have a reservation.

37:05.288 --> 37:06.657
Yes, you do.

37:06.690 --> 37:09.026
Okay, is the critic
here yet?

37:09.059 --> 37:10.060
He just arrived.

37:10.093 --> 37:11.194
You know how important
this is

37:11.228 --> 37:12.562
with this critic
coming back in here?

37:12.596 --> 37:13.997
Yeah.

37:14.031 --> 37:16.933
They normally never visit
a restaurant, yeah, twice.

37:16.967 --> 37:18.368
Make sure we don't
fuss over him too much

37:18.402 --> 37:20.370
where it becomes obvious,
yes? let's go.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.805
The last time that food critic
was in here,

37:21.838 --> 37:22.973
he trashed
the  out of us.

37:23.006 --> 37:23.974
I'm very grateful

37:24.007 --> 37:25.275
he's giving us
another chance.

37:25.308 --> 37:27.177
It's gonna make
or break us tonight.

37:27.210 --> 37:29.646
Tonight it's your night.
Come on. Yes?

37:29.680 --> 37:30.395
Okay.
Come on.

37:30.395 --> 37:32.049
Okay.
Come on.

37:32.082 --> 37:33.350
How are you
this evening?

37:33.383 --> 37:34.518
How are you?

37:34.551 --> 37:36.153
My name's Brian.
I'll be taking care of you.

37:36.186 --> 37:37.688
I'm gonna get, uh,
potato soup.

37:37.721 --> 37:38.822
I'm gonna get perogy.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.424
Potato soups
and perogies?
Right, right.

37:40.457 --> 37:41.591
I'll be right back
with them.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.060
Thank you.
No problem.

37:43.093 --> 37:45.562
This is gonna try and get out
as soon as possible.

37:45.595 --> 37:46.897
It's the critic's.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.398
I'm like, "Oh, goodness."

37:48.432 --> 37:50.667
I'm nervous,
but I'm confident.

37:50.701 --> 37:52.703
I'm like,
"Well, why can't I do this?

37:52.736 --> 37:54.304
Brian, take this out.

37:54.337 --> 37:57.941
Right here.
This is his.

37:57.974 --> 38:00.395
I have potato soup.
I have your perogies.

38:00.395 --> 38:00.477
I have potato soup.
I have your perogies.

38:00.510 --> 38:01.478
Appreciate it.

38:01.511 --> 38:02.512
Enjoy.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.982
Man, this is so, so,
so very different.

38:18.061 --> 38:19.362
It's relaunch night,

38:19.396 --> 38:21.431
And the food critic
from the Philadelphia Weekly

38:21.464 --> 38:23.466
is about
to take his first bite.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.868
In his last review,

38:24.901 --> 38:26.903
he called the restaurant
"Spuddy hell,"

38:26.936 --> 38:29.105
and ruined the restaurant's
reputation.

38:29.139 --> 38:33.610
Man, this is so, so,
so very different.

38:33.643 --> 38:37.213
Is it chunky?

38:37.247 --> 38:39.983
Or is it creamy?

38:40.016 --> 38:41.951
Very smooth.
It's good.

38:45.455 --> 38:47.724
This is what
we worked so hard for,

38:47.757 --> 38:49.726
and it's not
spuddy hell anymore.

38:49.759 --> 38:52.696
Spuddy heaven.

38:52.729 --> 38:53.863
Ironically,

38:53.897 --> 38:55.799
The man that virtually
destroyed the restaurant

38:55.832 --> 38:58.902
with his review
is now enjoying dish...

38:58.935 --> 39:01.671
After dish.

39:01.705 --> 39:02.706
He said
everything was good.

39:02.739 --> 39:03.973
They ate almost everything.

39:04.007 --> 39:05.342
He said he was full.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.577
The critic is just
loving everything.

39:07.610 --> 39:10.113
Never did I think something
so huge would happen.

39:10.146 --> 39:11.481
Oh, so amazing.

39:11.514 --> 39:13.483
It really is, like,
the greatest feeling.

39:13.516 --> 39:14.392
Yeah.

39:14.392 --> 39:14.551
Yeah.

39:14.584 --> 39:15.719
Yeah!

39:15.752 --> 39:17.287
Oh, my God.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.621
We rocked it.

39:18.655 --> 39:20.790
He can't say anything wrong
about the potato.

39:20.824 --> 39:22.058
Got three tickets left.

39:22.092 --> 39:23.326
Focus, focus, focus.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.361
All the way to the end.
Come on.

39:24.394 --> 39:25.895
Come on!

39:25.929 --> 39:27.263
Seven.
Sloppy and veggie.

39:27.297 --> 39:28.698
Enjoy.
Wow.

39:28.732 --> 39:30.166
You girls
cleared the board.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.835
Okay, Danielle.
Nice.

39:32.802 --> 39:34.871
You guys are done.

39:34.904 --> 39:36.606
I've never served
this many people

39:36.639 --> 39:38.274
in one night ever.

39:38.308 --> 39:39.676
Ever.

39:39.709 --> 39:40.810
In two years.

39:40.844 --> 39:42.345
That's crazy to me.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.180
It's gonna be like this
for a month.

39:44.214 --> 39:44.392
And maybe, God forbid,

39:44.392 --> 39:45.281
And maybe, God forbid,

39:45.315 --> 39:47.250
we might catch up
on our bills.

39:47.283 --> 39:48.485
Oh, my God.

39:48.518 --> 39:50.320
Calm down.
It's okay.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.222
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just blown away.

39:52.255 --> 39:54.824
This is so  amazing.

39:54.858 --> 39:56.593
I can't even describe it.

39:56.626 --> 39:58.561
Like, what's happening
between all of us.

39:58.595 --> 40:00.263
Our relationships
are better.

40:00.296 --> 40:01.731
We're all communicating.

40:01.765 --> 40:05.068
Like, it's crazy.

40:05.101 --> 40:08.538
Holy.

40:08.571 --> 40:11.207
After feeding well over
100 guests,

40:11.241 --> 40:13.209
And having no dishes returned,

40:13.243 --> 40:14.392
Gordon has some final words
for the staff.

40:14.392 --> 40:15.979
Gordon has some final words
for the staff.

40:16.012 --> 40:18.448
When I first arrived,
honestly,

40:18.481 --> 40:20.049
I was looking at a family

40:20.083 --> 40:22.919
that had lost its drive,
passion,

40:22.952 --> 40:24.120
and so fragmented,

40:24.154 --> 40:25.889
I honestly felt,
for the first time

40:25.922 --> 40:27.957
in five years
in Kitchen Nightmares,

40:27.991 --> 40:30.326
I was wasting my time.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.996
But you showed me tonight

40:33.029 --> 40:34.831
that each and every
one of you

40:34.864 --> 40:38.334
has got the capabilities
to turn this around.

40:38.368 --> 40:40.670
But you, madam,

40:40.703 --> 40:43.106
you're gonna explode.

40:43.139 --> 40:44.392
I believe in you.

40:44.392 --> 40:44.474
I believe in you.

40:44.507 --> 40:47.544
Now believe in yourself.

40:47.577 --> 40:49.579
It's incredible
how much has changed

40:49.612 --> 40:50.947
In just a few days.

40:50.980 --> 40:54.617
Cooking wasn't really
a huge aspiration of mine,

40:54.651 --> 40:58.621
but this whole thing has just
changed me around, 360.

40:58.655 --> 41:01.591
I'm really thankful
for everything that's happened.

41:01.624 --> 41:04.494
This is a career that I want.

41:04.527 --> 41:07.664
Great family,
great restaurant,

41:07.697 --> 41:10.967
and honestly,
a great future.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.968
Stick with it.

41:12.001 --> 41:14.392
Thank you. Thank you.

41:14.392 --> 41:14.571
Thank you. Thank you.

41:14.604 --> 41:16.005
I think
Chef Ramsay's amazing.

41:16.039 --> 41:17.040
Take care, darling.

41:17.073 --> 41:19.642
I mean,
times with my family

41:19.676 --> 41:22.078
have been really rough
the last couple years,

41:22.111 --> 41:24.714
but, you know,
having this experience

41:24.747 --> 41:28.518
was probably one of
the best days of our lives.

41:28.551 --> 41:29.853
Good night.

41:29.886 --> 41:33.356
Thank you.

41:33.389 --> 41:34.791
The other night
when I walked out,

41:34.824 --> 41:36.326
I felt really depressed.

41:36.359 --> 41:37.427
And I actually felt

41:37.460 --> 41:39.929
I'd met my match
for the first time.

41:39.963 --> 41:41.364
But on the back of that,

41:41.397 --> 41:42.599
tonight has been
one of the most

41:42.632 --> 41:44.067
gratifying experiences

41:44.100 --> 41:44.392
I've ever had
in Kitchen Nightmares.

41:44.392 --> 41:45.935
I've ever had
in Kitchen Nightmares.

41:45.969 --> 41:47.604
Now the Hot Potato Cafe

41:47.637 --> 41:50.473
is the talk of Philadelphia,
but for me,

41:50.507 --> 41:52.275
it's about
an amazing turnaround

41:52.308 --> 41:53.710
of four women--

41:53.743 --> 41:57.714
three aunts and one niece.

41:57.747 --> 41:59.782
God.

41:59.816 --> 42:03.253
Long live
the power of women.

42:07.557 --> 42:09.859
The turnaround for
the Hot Potato was amazing.

42:09.893 --> 42:11.194
I'm gonna take you back
to a table.

42:11.227 --> 42:12.829
How about that?

42:12.862 --> 42:14.392
And Gordon helped spread
the word on the airwaves...

42:14.392 --> 42:15.565
And Gordon helped spread
the word on the airwaves...

42:15.598 --> 42:17.333
Chef Gordon Ramsay
as you see here,

42:17.367 --> 42:18.401
busy now,
hitting the road

42:18.434 --> 42:19.969
for another show,
Kitchen Nightmares.

42:20.003 --> 42:21.070
From the Hot Potato Cafe,

42:21.104 --> 42:22.272
thank you guys
for coming in.

42:22.305 --> 42:23.273
...And on the streets.

42:23.306 --> 42:24.874
Whoo!

42:24.908 --> 42:28.578
Come to
the Hot Potato Cafe, guys!

42:28.611 --> 42:30.313
The city of Philadelphia
has a new jewel

42:30.346 --> 42:32.882
that has the best potatoes
in town.

42:32.916 --> 42:34.450
Hot potato cafe rocks!

42:34.484 --> 42:37.220
And the Hot Potato
received rave reviews

42:37.253 --> 42:39.255
from the Philadelphia Weekly.

42:39.289 --> 42:41.324
Going from spuddy hell
to new starch.

42:41.357 --> 42:42.926
"Fishtown's
Hot Potato Cafe

42:42.959 --> 42:44.392
went from spud dud
to spud palace overnight."

42:44.392 --> 42:45.695
went from spud dud
to spud palace overnight."

42:45.728 --> 42:46.696
Overnight.

42:46.729 --> 42:48.298
I--I am so happy.

42:48.331 --> 42:50.400
Now I love this place.

42:50.433 --> 42:52.268
There's no where else
I want to be.

42:52.302 --> 42:54.170
Atmosphere--
quaint and homey,

42:54.203 --> 42:56.172
service--
friendly, helpful,

42:56.205 --> 42:58.174
food--outstanding.

42:58.207 --> 42:59.576
I just can't even tell you

42:59.609 --> 43:01.844
How amazing this gift
has been.

43:01.878 --> 43:03.446
People don't
get opportunities

43:03.479 --> 43:05.081
like this in their lifetime.

43:05.081 --> 43:07.772
Oh, I love you.
