FALCO: Yeah.

38:51.757 --> 38:55.258
BULLET: What was
that business with Crowbar?

38:55.293 --> 38:59.863
FALCO: I... went into that Pagans bar.

38:59.898 --> 39:04.234
He was there. It didn't go well.

39:04.269 --> 39:07.604
BULLET: You can't keep stuff
like that from me, Chef.

39:07.639 --> 39:09.472
That could cost us.

39:09.508 --> 39:10.707
(knock on door)

39:10.742 --> 39:12.709
MEREDITH: Bullet?

39:21.420 --> 39:22.619
(door slams)

39:22.654 --> 39:24.387
MEREDITH: What the hell was that?

39:24.423 --> 39:26.556
BULLET: (sighs)
I'd call it a good start.

39:26.591 --> 39:28.458
MEREDITH: That was grounds
for multiple arrests.

39:28.493 --> 39:30.760
BULLET: Well,
they're playing for bigger stakes,

39:30.796 --> 39:33.296
and so are we.

39:33.331 --> 39:37.067
MEREDITH: (breathing heavily)

39:37.102 --> 39:40.904
I'm guessing that was more
than you bargained for.

39:40.939 --> 39:43.506
FALCO: Yeah.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.910
Uh... I saw a lot in the Vagos, but...

39:46.945 --> 39:49.446
nothing like that.

39:49.481 --> 39:51.648
Are you guys sure we're
on the right side,

39:51.683 --> 39:55.118
getting involved with the Outlaws?

39:55.153 --> 39:57.420
BULLET: There's no right side, Chef.

39:57.456 --> 40:00.824
There's us, there's criminals,
there's evidence...

40:00.859 --> 40:03.293
That's it.

40:03.328 --> 40:08.598
FALCO: Yeah, Koz used to say
law enforcement was like chess.

40:08.633 --> 40:10.433
There's no checkmate;
there's only check.

40:10.469 --> 40:11.768
BULLET: (chuckles)

40:11.803 --> 40:15.205
Trust me, there's gonna be
checkmate, alright.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.040
It's just gonna take plenty
of moves to get there,

40:17.075 --> 40:18.341
and if you wanna keep playing,

40:18.376 --> 40:21.511
I'll need your help with the next one.

40:21.546 --> 40:23.046
FALCO: Oh, yeah? What's that?

40:23.081 --> 40:26.216
BULLET: Getting you patched.

40:26.251 --> 40:30.487
FALCO: So go ahead, patch me in.

40:30.522 --> 40:33.823
BULLET: For that,
I'm gonna have to go back to LA.

40:33.859 --> 40:36.993
And I'll need you to come with me.

40:37.028 --> 40:39.329
FALCO: You do know
why I had to leave, right?

40:39.364 --> 40:40.363
BULLET: Club politics.

40:40.398 --> 40:42.799
They're gonna need to vet you.

40:42.834 --> 40:44.701
MEREDITH: Why don't you sleep on it?

40:44.736 --> 40:47.370
You don't have to answer now.

40:47.405 --> 40:52.108
FALCO: Right. Like I'm gonna sleep.

40:54.412 --> 40:58.815
BULLET: Chef?

40:58.850 --> 41:01.518
You did good tonight.
