&lrm;Then, I'd come and save you.

&lrm;You don't get it. I've had enough
&lrm;of being shut up at home.

&lrm;I wanna make friends,

&lrm;[Plagg groans] I think I'm feeling weak.

&lrm;You eating this smelly camembert cheese

02:04.360 --> 02:06.520
&lrm;and that I have to smell like it 24/7.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.800
&lrm;That's strange.

&lrm;If you want to transform into a superhero,

&lrm;to be a superhero like people think?

&lrm;[Adrien] Say you were too late,

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
&lrm;please.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.640
&lrm;How could you say that?
&lrm;You're the Stoneheart.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.000
&lrm;[sarcatic] So I'm the one

03:42.160 --> 03:43.760
&lrm;who broke Sabrina's dad's arm?

03:43.920 --> 03:46.760
&lrm;Just because your footage
&lrm;of those lame heroes was on TV,

03:46.920 --> 03:49.440
&lrm;you don't have to get
&lrm;so high and mighty.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.480
&lrm;Look out, she's angry.

03:53.640 --> 03:57.920
&lrm;She's going to split her underwear
&lrm;and turn into a huge monster.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.520
&lrm;[Adrien] Hey, Chloe.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.000

&lrm;[excited muttering] He's so handsome!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.440
&lrm;I'll handle it.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.960
&lrm;You should tell Mylene how you feel.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.400
&lrm;I don't know what you're talking about.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.720
&lrm;Come on, I saw how you look at her.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.720
&lrm;No, no negative emotions.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.160
&lrm;What I mean is... be positive.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.160
&lrm;I'm sure she likes you too.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.640
&lrm;[whispering] Go talk to her.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.560
&lrm;I'm no good with words.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.560
&lrm;Who needs words?

04:42.720 --> 04:45.920
&lrm;You could draw her a picture,
&lrm;send her flowers...

04:46.080 --> 04:48.000
&lrm;I could write her a song?

04:48.160 --> 04:49.560
&lrm;That's a great idea.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.320
&lrm;Who wouldn't want
&lrm;a love song written for her?

04:52.480 --> 04:54.480
&lrm;Go for it, Ivan, and stay positive.

&lrm;Can I have your autograph?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.320
&lrm;Can I have an autograph? I'm a huge fan.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.480
&lrm;This is your seat, Adrikins.
&lrm;I saved it for you,

05:10.600 --> 05:12.440
&lrm;right in front of me.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.080
&lrm;Thanks, Chloe.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.000
&lrm;Hey... Adrien.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.120
&lrm;[suspiciously] You're friends with Chloe?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.000
&lrm;Hey, what's that all about?

05:24.160 --> 05:27.960
&lrm;The brats who sat here yesterday
&lrm;need some attitude adjustment.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.800
&lrm;I'm just commanding
&lrm;a bit of respect, that's all.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.680
&lrm;Think that's really necessary?

05:32.840 --> 05:36.120
&lrm;You've got a lot to learn
&lrm;about school culture, Adrikins.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.800
&lrm;Watch the master.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.400
&lrm;Alya, wouldn't you like to be a superhero

05:40.520 --> 05:42.880
&lrm;and fight monsters and villains?

05:43.040 --> 05:45.720
&lrm;Totally. I'm not scared of anyone. Why?

05:45.880 --> 05:47.880
&lrm;No reason.

&lrm;OK, I get it.
&lrm;Good job, you 3. Very funny.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.000
&lrm;No, no. I was trying to take it off.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.520
&lrm;Really?

06:09.960 --> 06:12.240
&lrm;You're friends with Chloe, right?

06:12.360 --> 06:14.280
&lrm;Why do people keep saying that?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.880
&lrm;See what I mean about respect?

06:21.200 --> 06:23.720
&lrm;I know I've seen him somewhere before.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.320
&lrm;[gasping] Of course.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.440
&lrm;He's the son of fave' designer,
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste!

06:28.600 --> 06:31.240
&lrm;Daddy's boy,
&lrm;teen supermodel and Chloe's buddy?

06:31.400 --> 06:32.480
&lrm;[scoffing] Forget it.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.440
&lrm;Why not tell her it was Chloe?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.320
&lrm;I've known Chloe since I was a kid.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.280
&lrm;She's not perfect
&lrm;but I can't throw her under the bus.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.600
&lrm;She's my only friend.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.040
&lrm;I'm Nino. It's time for you to make

06:44.160 --> 06:45.560
&lrm;some new friends.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.720
&lrm;I'm going to be late.

&lrm;[she shrieks] Ivan...

06:50.440 --> 06:51.480
&lrm;you scared me.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.280
&lrm;I made this for you.

&lrm;[higher pitch] Be serene...!

07:08.560 --> 07:09.600
&lrm;[evil voice] Yes...

07:10.480 --> 07:14.920
&lrm;I've been waiting for this.
&lrm;You know the way, evil Akuma.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.440
&lrm;Track down your prey.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.720
&lrm;Fly away, and evilise him!

&lrm;This is your 2nd chance,
&lrm;Stoneheart and now you have extra help.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.080
&lrm;No-one will stop you
&lrm;capturing your loved one,

&lrm;Present!

08:13.320 --> 08:15.040
&lrm;Let go of me, Ivan.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.880
&lrm;I'm not Ivan anymore. I'm Stoneheart.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.040
&lrm;Why are you doing this?

08:19.560 --> 08:22.040
&lrm;So you and I can be together, forever!

&lrm;[Chloe whimpers]
&lrm;Daddy, the monster is back.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.880

&lrm;Please, my hair.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.200
&lrm;[Mylene] Put us down, Ivan.

&lrm;Let's follow him.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.200
&lrm;Oh no, you go.
&lrm;I'm finding a place to hide.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.720
&lrm;You're gonna miss Ladybug in action.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.600
&lrm;You and Ladybug will be
&lrm;better off without me.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.160
&lrm;If you say so.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.600
&lrm;Wait, your bag.

&lrm;make it past roll call.

&lrm;the army and the entire cavalry.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.760
&lrm;Don't forget the superheroes!

&lrm;Super-incompetent, you mean.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.600
&lrm;You wanted the cavalry?

&lrm;Here it is!

&lrm;[Mylene] No!

&lrm;We'll be brought together forever.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.200
&lrm;[Alya screams]

10:20.600 --> 10:21.960
&lrm;Let go, you rock-head!

&lrm;Help!

10:38.360 --> 10:40.880
&lrm;-I need Ladybug.
&lrm;-I knew you'd come around.

&lrm;You can't stay here. It's too dangerous.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.080
&lrm;[Ladybug] Sorry I was late.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.360
&lrm;Have I ever told you
&lrm;you turn my world upside down?

11:32.640 --> 11:34.360
&lrm;You're quite a joker.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.640
&lrm;But your timing needs work.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.960
&lrm;We gotta go.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.680
&lrm;Aren't we gonna take care of them?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.320
&lrm;No, if we want to save them all
&lrm;then we go to the source...

11:49.480 --> 11:50.880
&lrm;that one.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.520
&lrm;I demand my daughter's safe return.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.640
&lrm;Daddy!

12:02.840 --> 12:04.720
&lrm;You're welcome to her!

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
&lrm;[she screams]

12:07.320 --> 12:09.560
&lrm;I promise to be nice, be polite and...

12:11.120 --> 12:12.840
&lrm;-I didn't promise.
&lrm;-What?

12:13.320 --> 12:14.720
&lrm;My little princess.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.440
&lrm;We're clear to attack!

12:16.560 --> 12:19.160
&lrm;Wait, don't attack. You'll make it worse.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.720
&lrm;I've a new plan.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.760
&lrm;Leave it to the pros.
&lrm;You already failed once.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.080
&lrm;He's right.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.520
&lrm;Had I captured the Akuma the 1st time,

12:29.680 --> 12:30.960
&lrm;this wouldn't have happened.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.080
&lrm;I knew I wasn't the one for this job.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.240
&lrm;No. He's wrong.
&lrm;Without you, she wouldn't be here.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.360
&lrm;Without us, they won't make it.
&lrm;We'll prove it.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.720
&lrm;Trust me on this, OK?

12:41.880 --> 12:42.960
&lrm;OK.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.640
&lrm;[roaring]

12:44.800 --> 12:48.240
&lrm;[coughing and spluttering]

12:50.360 --> 12:51.480
&lrm;[weak groan]

12:55.080 --> 12:56.480
&lrm;People of Paris,

12:56.600 --> 12:57.880
&lrm;listen carefully...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.720
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.680
&lrm;Hawk moth?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.760
&lrm;[evil voice] Ladybug, Cat Noir,

13:02.880 --> 13:04.000
<i>&lrm;give me</i>

13:04.120 --> 13:06.760
<i>&lrm;the Ladybug earrings and the cat ring now!</i>

13:06.880 --> 13:09.600
&lrm;You've done enough damage
&lrm;to these innocent people.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.240
&lrm;Nice try, but we know who the bad guy is.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.240
&lrm;Let's not reverse the roles.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.400
&lrm;You turned these
&lrm;innocent victims into villains.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.840
&lrm;Hawk Moth, no matter how long it takes,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.400
&lrm;we will find you

13:21.560 --> 13:23.920
&lrm;and you'll hand us your Miraculous!

13:28.880 --> 13:30.680
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

13:31.720 --> 13:33.000
&lrm;[Hawk Moth groans]

13:33.160 --> 13:35.320
&lrm;[Ladybug yells]

13:42.480 --> 13:43.920
&lrm;Let me make this promise.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.600
&lrm;Whoever wants to harm you,

13:45.720 --> 13:48.760
&lrm;Cat Noir and I will do
&lrm;all we can to keep you safe.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.280
&lrm;Yes!

13:58.200 --> 14:00.480
&lrm;Whoever she is beneath that mask

14:00.640 --> 14:01.880
&lrm;I love that girl.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.520
&lrm;That's the problem with superheroes,
&lrm;they're too... heroic!

14:06.640 --> 14:10.040
&lrm;Stoneheart, they're trying to take
&lrm;your loved one away.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.560
&lrm;Snatch their Miraculouses,
&lrm;they'll be powerless against you.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.360
&lrm;OK, Hawk Moth.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.280
&lrm;[Mylene] Help me!

14:18.440 --> 14:20.480
&lrm;You'll never take Mylene from me!

14:22.160 --> 14:24.760
&lrm;[Stoneheart] Come to me, my Stonebeings!

14:26.880 --> 14:28.680
&lrm;We're surrounded.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.520
&lrm;What now? We can't attack him.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.680
&lrm;But we know where the Akuma is.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.680
&lrm;[Cat Noir] In the fist he's got Mylene in.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.480
&lrm;So, he's in love with her...

14:37.640 --> 14:38.720
&lrm;That's it!

14:38.840 --> 14:42.240
&lrm;We don't separate them,
&lrm;we bring them closer together.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.320
&lrm;They're made each other,
&lrm;they just don't know it.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.360
&lrm;I don't get it,
&lrm;but I guess I better trust you.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.640
&lrm;Something tells me
&lrm;this is how it'll be in future.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.520
&lrm;[helicopters hum]

15:03.720 --> 15:05.520
&lrm;Help! I'm scared of heights!

15:05.680 --> 15:07.160
&lrm;It'll be alright!

15:08.040 --> 15:09.560
&lrm;[Stoneheart roars]

15:12.480 --> 15:14.760
&lrm;How will you get them even closer?

15:15.120 --> 15:16.520
&lrm;By using our powers!

15:16.640 --> 15:19.120
&lrm;Lucky charm!

15:24.880 --> 15:27.320
&lrm;A parachute?
&lrm;What do I do with this?

15:27.480 --> 15:28.720
&lrm;[Cat Noir yells]

15:30.160 --> 15:31.840
&lrm;You know what you're doing?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.680
&lrm;We'll find out soon enough.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.920
&lrm;His hand... get ready!

15:42.160 --> 15:43.600
&lrm;[kissing]

15:46.000 --> 15:48.640
&lrm;[she yells]

15:56.480 --> 15:57.520
&lrm;Home run!

15:59.760 --> 16:01.600
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.160
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

16:07.360 --> 16:10.240
&lrm;[he yells]

16:10.360 --> 16:12.000
&lrm;[they yell]

16:15.200 --> 16:16.880
&lrm;Cat Noir, take care of Ivan!

16:18.200 --> 16:19.680
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:32.800 --> 16:34.160
&lrm;Gotcha!

16:35.080 --> 16:36.640
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

16:43.040 --> 16:44.960
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.560
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

16:55.040 --> 16:57.520
&lrm;[Cat noir amazed] Are you seeing this?

16:57.680 --> 17:01.920
&lrm;Yeah, it's beautiful and amazing, it's...

17:02.080 --> 17:03.760
&lrm;miraculous!

17:04.400 --> 17:06.359
&lrm;This is just the beginning, Ladybug.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.359
&lrm;You may have won this battle

17:08.480 --> 17:10.319
&lrm;but I will win the war!

17:10.960 --> 17:14.480
&lrm;I will get your Miraculouses,
&lrm;I will get the absolute power,

17:14.640 --> 17:17.440
&lrm;and then, my secret dream will come true!

17:19.440 --> 17:21.680
&lrm;I think you two need to talk.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.520
&lrm;I...I...

17:24.400 --> 17:27.520
&lrm;It may help if you read
&lrm;the lyrics to Ivan's song.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.160
&lrm;It's beautiful.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.280
&lrm;It's a shame you can't hear them
&lrm;when you scream...

17:34.440 --> 17:35.520
&lrm;I mean sing.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.640
&lrm;It was scary, wasn't it?
&lrm;Is that why you left?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.320
&lrm;I'm sorry. I'll be gentle.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.080
&lrm;They're made for each other.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.320
&lrm;Like us two.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.720
&lrm;[bleeping] See that?

17:49.840 --> 17:52.200
&lrm;Time to split. See you soon, Cat Noir.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.640
&lrm;Can't wait, Milady.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.040
&lrm;By the time I biked to the Eiffel Tower,

18:04.200 --> 18:06.160
&lrm;it was all over. I'm way bummed.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.760
&lrm;You'll get your scoop eventually.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.520
&lrm;You're right. next target,
&lrm;"Ladybug: An Exclusive Interview."

18:12.680 --> 18:14.160
&lrm;Sounds exciting.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.880
&lrm;Oh, wait, even better,

18:16.040 --> 18:18.560
&lrm;"Finding out
&lrm;who's really under that mask!"

18:18.720 --> 18:20.440
&lrm;Good luck with that one.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.400
<i>&lrm;You disobeyed me.</i>

18:22.520 --> 18:24.560
<i>&lrm;You see that school?</i>

18:25.160 --> 18:26.040
&lrm;Yes, Father.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.960
<i>&lrm;You will never,</i>
<i>&lrm;I say never, go back there again,</i>

18:29.320 --> 18:31.320
&lrm;-Father...
&lrm;-<i>&lrm;without your bodyguard.</i>

18:31.480 --> 18:33.040
<i>&lrm;He'll drop you off and pick you up.</i>

18:33.160 --> 18:35.240
<i>&lrm;Nathalie will organise your schedule.</i>

18:35.400 --> 18:38.680
<i>&lrm;You'll continue music, Chinese,</i>
<i>&lrm;fencing and your photo shoots.</i>

18:38.800 --> 18:41.200
&lrm;Thank you, Nathalie,
&lrm;Thank you, father.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.400
&lrm;No, wait.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.600
&lrm;[Chloe] You're in

18:52.720 --> 18:53.760
&lrm;the wrong seat.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.000
&lrm;Go on, get lost.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.320
&lrm;All that's necessary
&lrm;for the triumph of evil

18:57.480 --> 18:59.160
&lrm;is that good people do nothing.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.960
&lrm;What's that supposed to mean?

19:01.080 --> 19:03.320
&lrm;It means I'm not putting up
&lrm;with your crud anymore,

19:03.480 --> 19:05.000
&lrm;neither is anyone else.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.800
&lrm;So take your attitude and go and get lost.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.600
&lrm;[laughing]

19:15.240 --> 19:16.200
&lrm;Good job.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.400
&lrm;You wanna make friends, right?

19:25.560 --> 19:27.480
&lrm;Talk to Marinette about the gum.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.760
&lrm;What should I say?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.400
&lrm;Just be yourself.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.040
&lrm;Hey.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.120
&lrm;[she huffs]

19:44.560 --> 19:45.920
&lrm;I just want you to know

19:46.080 --> 19:48.200
&lrm;I was only trying to get the gum off,

19:48.320 --> 19:49.200
&lrm;I swear.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.720
&lrm;I've never been to school before.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.360
&lrm;I've never had friends.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.640
&lrm;It's all sort of new to me.

19:56.800 --> 20:03.160
&lrm;[romantic music]

20:03.280 --> 20:05.040
&lrm;[thunder rumbles]

20:05.160 --> 20:11.880
&lrm;[romantic music]

20:18.600 --> 20:21.160
&lrm;See you tomorrow.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.000
&lrm;[romantic music]

20:24.160 --> 20:26.520
&lrm;[stammering] See you tomorrow...

20:26.680 --> 20:28.680
&lrm;[chuckling] Why am I stammering?

20:29.160 --> 20:32.200
&lrm;Hey. I think I might have an idea.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.760
&lrm;First day of school
&lrm;and we already have two love-birds.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.040
&lrm;[puffing] Whatever, she's just a friend.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.360
&lrm;A friend.

20:44.240 --> 20:49.080
&lrm;[romantic music]

20:55.840 --> 20:57.600
&lrm;[Waizze] Excellent choice, master.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.320
&lrm;Those two are made for each other.
