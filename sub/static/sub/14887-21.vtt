01:24.250 --> 01:26.853
Okay, Cousin Billy,
nice talking to you.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.155
Um, I tell Cousin Larry,
you're coming.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.825
He's going to be
so happy to see his brother.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.227
Yeah. Huh?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.663
Oh. Ciao to you too, guy.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.568
Lydia, you'll never
guess who just called.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.236
Larry's brother Billy?

01:43.269 --> 01:45.305
Get out of the city!

01:46.272 --> 01:47.841
You read my mind.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.411
You must have PMS.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.316
Thanks, Harriette.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.484
Cousin,
the most wonderful news

01:58.519 --> 02:00.621
your brother Billy called.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.290
Billy? My brother?
My brother Billy called?

02:04.324 --> 02:06.226
Uh, Cousin Billy just called

02:06.259 --> 02:09.229
and h‐he said that tomorrow
he's jetting in from Paris.

02:09.262 --> 02:12.332
And that, uh, he'll only be
in town for a couple of hours

02:12.365 --> 02:15.235
but he was hoping that
we could do lunch.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.639
And I've never done
lunch before so...

02:18.672 --> 02:21.508
...I‐I... He made it sound
so easy, I said, "yes."

02:22.876 --> 02:26.847
Cousin, I'm going
to meet another Appleton.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.282
Let's savor this moment.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.719
Well, I gotta go.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.626
That's the same look
my husband gets when I tell him

02:39.660 --> 02:41.962
my mother's comin' to dinner.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.631
Let me guess, your brother's
a deadbeat, right?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.900
He only shows up
to borrow money?

02:46.933 --> 02:48.268
Worse.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.770
Billy's...

02:49.803 --> 02:51.505
...successful.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.740
Ugh, I hate that.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.410
He owns his own company.
Jets around the world.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.513
Has a villa in Monte Carlo.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.914
He's Mr. Perfect.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.316
And he never
lets me forget it.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.652
Oh, what's the big deal, Larry?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.388
You go to lunch,
you listen to him brag

03:08.421 --> 03:10.190
stick him with the check.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.260
Well, he might
expect me to pay.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.929
See, I got tired
of Billy's bragging

03:15.962 --> 03:18.264
so I did a little
bragging of my own.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.267
About what?

03:22.703 --> 03:23.904
Well, about a lot of things.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.373
About how much money I make,
about what kinda car I drive‐‐

03:27.407 --> 03:29.810
So you exaggerated a little bit.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.378
Well, the most recent thing
I told him was that

03:32.412 --> 03:34.681
I'm city editor
of The Chronicle.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.786
"Oh, what
a tangled web we weave."

03:39.820 --> 03:41.822
I think when Billy gets here,
he'll figure out

03:41.855 --> 03:44.324
you are not the city editor.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.560
When Billy finds out the truth,
he's gonna torture me

03:46.593 --> 03:47.794
for the rest of my life.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.963
Well, "What goes
around comes around."

03:51.464 --> 03:53.900
Well, it hasn't
come around yet.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.536
I mean, I've fooled him
for two years

03:55.569 --> 03:57.771
surely I can fool him
for two hours.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.005
I'll get Balki
to back me up.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.608
We'll just run a bit of bogus
braggadocio by Brother Bill

04:01.642 --> 04:02.943
and by the time Billy
gets back on that Boeing

04:02.976 --> 04:04.978
he'll believe
I'm Ben Bradley.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.651
You're babbling, baby.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.754
Don't break out
the bubbly just yet, Lar.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.722
Balki's not gonna
go along with this.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.991
He is the most,
honest person in the world.

04:47.487 --> 04:48.555
What's so funny?

04:48.589 --> 04:51.925
I was just thinking
of the last time I saw Billy.

04:51.958 --> 04:56.630
He really got me good
playing Appleton Snow Job.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.932
‐ Appleton Snow Job?
‐ Yeah.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.534
What that?

05:00.567 --> 05:02.803
Oh, that's a game
we play in my family.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.971
You make up the biggest story
you can think of

05:05.005 --> 05:07.841
and you try to make
your brother believe it.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.342
Oh!

05:09.375 --> 05:11.477
And today, Billy
and I are gonna play.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.615
Billy and I are
gonna have such fun!

05:14.648 --> 05:15.982
Oh, right.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.085
Cousin, d‐do you suppose
that I could play too?

05:19.119 --> 05:21.888
Oh, Balki, I don't know. It's...

05:26.492 --> 05:28.929
It's hard to play
with more than two players.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.464
Oh, please? I‐I want
to play Appleton Snow Job.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.533
I don't think so‐‐

05:32.566 --> 05:33.734
I wanna play Appleton Snow Job.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
‐ No.
‐ I wanna play...

05:37.838 --> 05:39.773
Oh...

‐ What the heck? You're in.
‐ Okay.

05:42.776 --> 05:46.012
Cousin, I'm going
to play Appleton Snow Job.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.380
How do we play?

05:47.413 --> 05:50.083
First, we have
to make up a story.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.690
Ooh! I know.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.394
What if I tell him
I write a sports column?

06:01.427 --> 06:02.395
No.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.702
Ooh! I know.

06:10.504 --> 06:14.074
What if I tell him I run
the advertising department?

06:14.107 --> 06:15.075
No.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.683
I've got it.

06:22.716 --> 06:27.721
I'll tell Billy I'm
city editor of The Chronicle.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.122
No. Little over the top.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.858
[indistinct chatter]

06:31.892 --> 06:34.027
‐ Balki, Balki.
‐ Very original, though.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.664
City editor
is worth 50 points.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.134
It is?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.104
Wow!

06:45.906 --> 06:49.009
You really are good
at this game.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.677
When it comes to Snow Job

06:50.711 --> 06:53.614
I'm better than you know.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.781
But how're we
gonna pull this off?

06:54.815 --> 06:55.816
Ooh!

06:57.751 --> 06:59.886
I mean, Billy's coming
to the paper for lunch

06:59.920 --> 07:01.922
right from the airport
and we can't exactly ask

07:01.955 --> 07:04.124
Mr. Burns to leave his office?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.161
We don't have to,
cousin, because

07:08.194 --> 07:10.030
Mr. Burns goes to lunch

07:10.063 --> 07:12.232
everyday at exactly
one o'clock.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.735
By golly! You're right.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.670
I hadn't thought of that.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.007
What would convince Billy
I'm city editor?

07:21.041 --> 07:24.044
What if I brought
in a few personal things

07:24.077 --> 07:26.713
just to make the office
look like mine?

07:26.747 --> 07:27.781
Oh, look!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.818
This stuff would be perfect.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.527
Wow!

You are one

Come on, Balki,
Billy's on his way up.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.216
Balki, get
the picture on the wall.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.651
Not that picture!

08:13.794 --> 08:16.763
Cousin, wouldn't it...
Wouldn't it have been easier

08:16.797 --> 08:18.565
to just let Mr. Burns
in on the game?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.801
You can't play with four.
The teams would be uneven.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.237
Psst. He's comin' down the hall.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.806
‐ Well stall him a minute.
‐ Okay.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.708
Wait a minute...

08:27.741 --> 08:29.843
...I thought you said
you couldn't play with four.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.145
But she's not playing.
She's... an alternate.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.023
Mr. Appleton to see you,
Mr. Appleton.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.057

08:44.090 --> 08:45.225

08:50.897 --> 08:52.833
I hope you got the brains.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.105
Mmm‐mm‐mm.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.611
Hey, you look good.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.946
Put on a little weight.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.014
Well, success will do that.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.616
Yeah, don't I know.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.186
You must be Balki.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.255
Cousin Billy!

09:15.288 --> 09:17.157
I'm so glad to meet you.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.826
You know, if there's anything
at all that you need.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.362
Socks, deodorant,
toe‐nail clipper

09:22.395 --> 09:24.798
don't hesitate
to say the word.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.901
Because, any brother
of Cousin Larry's

09:27.934 --> 09:29.870
is a cousin of mine.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.772
Okay.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.040
So, uh,
come on in, sit down.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.776
So, uh, Billy...

09:37.377 --> 09:39.312
What do you think of my office?

09:39.345 --> 09:43.183
It's nice. It's almost as big
as my office in London.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.952
You think this is big,
you should see Cousin Larry's

09:45.986 --> 09:47.287
other office.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.056
It's as big as a basement.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.929
You have two offices?

09:55.962 --> 09:57.898
Well, they treat me,
pretty well.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.199
[Balki]
Pretty well?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.967
Pretty well?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.704
They treat this man as
if he were Prince Valium.

10:05.839 --> 10:10.010
After all, he's the youngest
publisher in Chicago.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.645
Balki...

10:11.678 --> 10:14.648
I‐I thought
you were city editor?

10:14.681 --> 10:15.782
Well, I am, but‐‐

10:15.816 --> 10:18.051
Oh, cousin,
I‐I didn't tell you

10:18.084 --> 10:20.320
while you were having
breakfast with Ted Koppel.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.288
You got a promotion.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.826
But I haven't accepted yet.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.962
Wow. Who is this?

10:28.995 --> 10:30.931
Don't tell me this
is the lady in your life.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.133
Lady in his life?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.902
Lady in his life?

10:35.936 --> 10:38.872
Lady in his life?

10:38.905 --> 10:40.073
Ha!

10:40.106 --> 10:42.676
What was the question?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.845
‐ Who is this?
‐ Oh, that's Jennifer.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.413
She just happens
to be Cousin Larry's fiance

10:47.447 --> 10:49.716
and a former Miss Costa Rica.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.259
Uh, listen, uh,
we're gonna be late.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.062
Uh, my car's in the shop, so
we're gonna have to take a cab.

11:02.095 --> 11:02.963
‐ Okay.
‐ Oh, cousin.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.732
Why don't we just
hop in your helicopter?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.133
Helicopter?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.334
Oh, well, we can't use it.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.204
It's just a two‐seater.

[instrumental music]

11:31.491 --> 11:34.127
Cousin,
what a great game!

11:34.160 --> 11:36.830
You‐you know, you should
really call Parker brothers

11:36.863 --> 11:39.332
and ask them if they wanna make
a home version of Appletons.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.935
‐ No joke.
‐ Balki‐‐

11:41.968 --> 11:43.937
Did you see
Cousin Billy's face

11:43.970 --> 11:45.939
when I told him
that NASA wants you

11:45.972 --> 11:47.908
to be the first journalist
on the moon?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.478
‐ Balki...
‐ Cousin, question.

11:52.513 --> 11:55.949
If Cousin Billy is‐is
on his way to the airport

11:55.982 --> 11:58.785
uh, when are we going
to tell him that we fooled him

11:58.819 --> 12:02.022
so that we can all have
the laugh riot of our lives?

12:07.127 --> 12:07.861
Balki...

12:09.996 --> 12:11.431
...I've gotta tell
you the truth.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.432
What?

12:13.934 --> 12:17.337
There is no such game
as Appleton Snow Job.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.139
I made it all up.

12:22.108 --> 12:25.211
Come on, y‐y‐you crazy,
son of a goat, you.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.148
It's got to be a game.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.816
Otherwise, what is it?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.985
It's just a big pack of lies.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.124
Well, I wouldn't
call it a big pack of lies.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.998
You lied to me.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.502
You lied to Cousin Billy.

12:50.571 --> 12:53.106
You made me lie
to Cousin Billy.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.011
Have I left anything out?

12:58.044 --> 13:01.047
Balki, I'm sorry. I‐I shouldn't
have dragged you into this.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.215
It's just...

13:02.248 --> 13:03.917
...I couldn't let Billy know

13:03.950 --> 13:05.886
I'm not
as successful as he is.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.555
Well, cousin, you just got
to tell Cousin Billy the truth.

13:08.589 --> 13:09.923
‐ And I will.
‐ You will?

13:09.956 --> 13:10.957
‐ I will.
‐ You will?

13:10.991 --> 13:12.358
‐ I will.
‐ When?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.460
The very next time
I see him.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.563
Well, I should hope so.

13:16.597 --> 13:19.099
Unfortunately that
could be two or three years.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.502
Until then I'll just have to
bear the burden of my guilt.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.469
[phone ringing]

13:23.504 --> 13:25.005
Appleton.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.072
What?

13:27.273 --> 13:29.442
Oh‐uh... No, that‐that's
wonderful news.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.845
Wait... Yeah, sure!

13:31.878 --> 13:33.113
Yeah.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.147
Bye‐bye.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.219
‐ Who was that?
‐ Billy.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.088
His flight got cancelled, he's
gonna spend the night with us.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.531
Lucky break, huh?

13:51.397 --> 13:54.367
[instrumental music]

14:01.141 --> 14:02.142
Well...

14:03.143 --> 14:04.110
Did you?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.948
Did you tell
Cousin Billy the truth?

14:07.981 --> 14:12.519
I told Billy everything
he needs to know, and more.

14:12.553 --> 14:14.354
Oh, cousin. Ah!

14:15.421 --> 14:17.958
I'm so proud of you.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.326
‐ Don't you feel good?
‐ Never felt better.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.495
In fact, uh, Billy and I
are gonna go out to dinner

14:22.529 --> 14:24.965
you know,
to tell some more truth.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.035
So, why don't you go over
to Jennifer and Mary Anne's?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.371
I think they
have some fresh pop‐corn.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.540
Larry, does Balki
have a lint brush?

14:33.574 --> 14:35.308
‐ Oh, hi, Balki.
‐ Hi, Cousin Billy.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.177
This is a nice little place
you have here.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.946
‐ Do you have a lint brush?
‐ Uh, yes, in my lint drawer.

14:41.948 --> 14:45.218
Oh, alright, I didn't know.
I should've looked there first.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.120
Listen, I‐I just wanna let you
know how much I appreciate

14:47.153 --> 14:49.422
you puttin' us up, while Larry's
gettin' his townhouse remodeled.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.624
Thanks.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.405
Well, you big, fat liar.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.112
You didn't tell him the truth.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.015
You let me walk around
the block in the cold

15:15.048 --> 15:18.451
freezing my buttocks off
for an hour...

15:18.484 --> 15:22.155
...so that you could tell him
about your alleged townhouse?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.159
What? Is your conscience broken?

15:26.192 --> 15:29.295
If Jiminy Cricket were here,
he'd puke in his hat.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.404
Balki, try to understand.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.042
For the first time, Billy is
treating me with respect.

15:42.075 --> 15:42.976
[spitting]

15:44.545 --> 15:47.981
I'm gonna go tell
Cousin Billy the truth.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.216
‐ You can't.
‐ Why not?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.185
This is between
two brothers and...

15:52.218 --> 15:54.454
...lies between brothers
are... sacred.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.692
Cousin, would you listen
to yourself?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.995
Why are you so afraid to tell
Cousin Billy the truth?

16:02.028 --> 16:03.564
He's just like you.

16:03.597 --> 16:06.099
He puts his pants on
one leg at at a time.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.467
[Billy clearing throat]

16:07.500 --> 16:09.703
Just that he does it
so much more effectively.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.373
Well, I hope
I'm not overdressed.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.781
Oh, darn! I‐I left my tuxedo
at the townhouse.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.149
But, uh, no problem,
we'll just go someplace

16:23.183 --> 16:24.718
that's tuxedo optional.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.619
Bye, Balki.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.721
Wait, wait, wait,
cousin, cousin, cousin.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.489
What's the hurry? Listen.

16:29.523 --> 16:31.525
You don't want to eat
on an empty stomach.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.293
Come and sit down.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.095
Let's have a nice little talk.

16:35.128 --> 16:39.600
You know, on Mypos,
we have a ritual.

16:39.633 --> 16:42.268
When two brothers have not seen
each other for a long time

16:42.302 --> 16:44.104
they have to sit and listen
to the story of

16:44.137 --> 16:45.772
The Brothers of Zockibodbud.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.710
Long, long ago

16:49.743 --> 16:52.779
on an island far, far away

16:52.813 --> 16:55.682
there lived the brothers,
Zockibodbud.

16:55.716 --> 16:57.818
Mookey and Glinkey.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.120
And when they were little boys

17:00.153 --> 17:02.689
they loved each other.

17:02.723 --> 17:04.691
And then, they grew up.

17:04.724 --> 17:09.162
And, uh, Mookey had everything
that a man could want.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.065
He had a fine farm

17:12.098 --> 17:14.400
and wonderful family

17:14.434 --> 17:17.069
and friends that were...

17:17.103 --> 17:19.705
...super.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.743
But, Mookey was sulky,
because his brother Glinkey

17:23.777 --> 17:25.679
had a bigger farm.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.147
And a more wonderful family.

17:28.181 --> 17:32.653
And friends that were
just a little more super...

17:32.686 --> 17:34.688
Well, that story
made me hungry.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.557
‐ Let's go eat.
‐ Okay.

17:36.590 --> 17:40.293
Envy ate at Mookey's heart.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.696
It gnawed and burrowed

17:42.729 --> 17:44.731
like an aphid in a rose bud.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.469
Mookey decided that
he would try to appear

17:49.503 --> 17:51.605
to be better than
Glinkey by lying.

17:52.873 --> 17:55.275
If Glinkey had a ram

17:55.308 --> 17:57.744
Mookey say that he had two rams.

17:57.778 --> 18:00.280
If Glinkey had a fine horse

18:00.313 --> 18:02.516
Mookey said he had a BMW.

18:05.719 --> 18:07.821
This went on for years.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.324
And Mookey piled lie upon lie

18:11.357 --> 18:14.795
and the ditch between them
grew wider and wider.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.565
One day, Mookey looked up...

18:20.466 --> 18:23.770
...and he was old and, lonely.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.373
And he looked into his heart

18:27.407 --> 18:31.144
and, he realized, that what
he wanted most in the world

18:31.177 --> 18:33.146
was a brother to love.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.885
And he told to himself

18:38.919 --> 18:40.787
I will tell Glinkey the truth

18:40.821 --> 18:43.489
and then we can love
each other again.

18:43.524 --> 18:46.827
So he began the long journey
to Glinkey's house.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.362
And it was difficult
for an old man

18:49.395 --> 18:51.665
but he didn't
know this, because

18:51.698 --> 18:55.669
the thought of holding
Glinkey in his arms again

18:55.702 --> 18:58.171
carried him forward.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.206
When he got
to Glinkey's house...

19:01.742 --> 19:03.944
...it was too late.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.646
Glinkey had died.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.716
And Mookey realized that a man

19:09.750 --> 19:13.419
who lives with lies lives alone.

19:18.859 --> 19:19.860
Billy...

19:20.827 --> 19:22.763
I can't take it anymore!

19:27.333 --> 19:29.335
I don't wanna end up
like Mookey.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.242
‐ Billy?
‐ It's lies.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.278
I‐It's all lies.
I don't own a company.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.682
I‐I don't even have a jet.
It's a rented tuxedo.

19:41.715 --> 19:42.983
Cufflinks are mine.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.485
Very nice.
Understated, which I like.

19:47.588 --> 19:49.790
But all the fancy addresses?

19:49.823 --> 19:53.660
Monte Carlo? Rio? Palm Beach?

19:53.694 --> 19:55.461
I'm a travel agent.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.300
I get deals.

20:02.869 --> 20:07.608
You... You mean you've lied
to me all these years?

20:10.010 --> 20:11.978
I know it was wrong.
I'm sorry.

20:12.012 --> 20:14.748
Oh, don't feel bad,
Cousin Billy.

20:16.850 --> 20:17.818
Please.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.392
I think Cousin Larry

20:26.426 --> 20:29.696
has something to say to you.

20:31.031 --> 20:32.999
Don't you, Cousin Larry?

20:33.033 --> 20:35.235
Yes, uh, of course I do.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.237
Billy...

20:39.339 --> 20:40.306
Billy...

20:42.543 --> 20:44.010
...I forgive you.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.319
Thank you.

20:53.887 --> 20:54.855
Thank you.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.929
Cousin...

21:02.963 --> 21:06.332
...don't you have... a little
bit more you want to say?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.572
Billy, look...

21:11.605 --> 21:14.941
...there's nothing
to forgive or be ashamed of.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.713
I've been doing the same thing.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.715
You're a travel agent?

21:25.952 --> 21:29.590
No, no, I mean, I've lied.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.725
I'm not the city editor
at the paper.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.927
I don't own a townhouse.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.462
Jennifer and I aren't engaged.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.431
But she does like me.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.770
Larry, why would you lie to me?

21:43.804 --> 21:45.872
Are you kidding?

21:45.906 --> 21:48.408
All my life I've had
to live up to you.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.110
Billy, the great athlete.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.078
Billy, the most
popular guy at school.

21:52.112 --> 21:54.347
I got tired of mom
and dad always saying

21:54.380 --> 21:56.349
"Why can't you be more like
your brother Billy?"

21:56.382 --> 21:58.418
Well, how do you think I liked
it when they kept saying

21:58.451 --> 21:59.786
"Why can't you be more like
your brother Larry?

21:59.820 --> 22:01.054
Look how good his grades are.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.956
Look how neat
he keeps his room.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.925
Look how well he irons."

22:11.397 --> 22:12.933
Gosh...

22:12.966 --> 22:17.437
All this time we've been
resenting each other, when...

22:17.470 --> 22:19.806
...we should've been
resenting mom and dad.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.650
Look, Larry, let's‐let's just
start all over again, alright?

22:29.683 --> 22:34.655
Let's stop all this lying
and... be good brothers.

22:35.856 --> 22:37.524
I'd like that.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.125
Me too.

22:58.679 --> 23:00.614
[Balki crying]

23:12.593 --> 23:14.528
That was beautiful.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.899
You know, I think someday

23:18.932 --> 23:20.634
you both are going to look back

23:20.667 --> 23:22.168
on this and realize

23:22.202 --> 23:24.805
that this was the moment

23:24.838 --> 23:26.840
you really became brothers.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.143
That this was the moment

23:30.176 --> 23:33.814
you really
stepped in something good.

23:35.516 --> 23:38.484
[instrumental music]

23:43.757 --> 23:46.192
[theme music]
