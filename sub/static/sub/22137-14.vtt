Well
I'm Kevin.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.080

Hi. Hello.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.290
What were
your names again?

27:09.290 --> 27:10.920
Ben.
Ben.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.880
Ben.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.880
Jamin.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.420
Ben and Benjamin...

27:17.420 --> 27:18.880
are our names.

27:18.880 --> 27:19.830
So, you're --
you're Benjamin?

27:19.830 --> 27:21.380
No! What -- Do you --

27:21.380 --> 27:22.380
Do you want to see
the merch or not?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I mean, gah!

27:23.750 --> 27:25.040
What?
We talked about this.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.540
What?
Let the sale come to you,
all right?

27:26.540 --> 27:27.920
You okay?
Yeah.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.790
Scared me a little bit.
That guy.

27:28.790 --> 27:30.040
Yeah.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.040
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.170
Yeah? All right.

27:33.830 --> 27:36.380
Hey, you know what?

27:36.380 --> 27:39.120
Look at the stuff, don't.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.210
It's all good, man.
Yeah.

27:40.210 --> 27:41.670
I could give a wet rat.

27:41.670 --> 27:42.920
-Oh.
-Aah.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.040
-Nope, that's --
-Oh.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.460
-I used to be able to...
-That's all right.

27:45.460 --> 27:46.540
-You can stop.
-You don have to --

27:46.540 --> 27:47.620
-I believe you.
-You don't have to.

27:49.540 --> 27:52.880
Peppi and the Tenderonis!
Wow!

27:52.880 --> 27:54.120
And they're still
in pretty good shape,

27:54.120 --> 27:55.750
considering how old
they are.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.000
Do they work?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.380
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

27:58.380 --> 27:59.500
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
-Yeah.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.540
I mean....no.

28:01.540 --> 28:03.290
Not totally.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.380
I mean, sometimes
the skunk catches on fire.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.250
But, you know,
maybe you want that.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.960
I suppose I could knock off
a few dollars.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.460
No. No, no, no, no, no.

28:11.460 --> 28:13.040
The price stays
exactly the same, all right?

28:13.040 --> 28:15.040
In fact, I think maybe
the price should get knocked up

28:15.040 --> 28:16.330
a little bit because of

28:16.330 --> 28:18.250
the whole interactive
fire element now.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.710
Okay, so, anyway,

28:19.710 --> 28:21.620
if you want them,
they're yours.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.040
Kevin: Okay. Yeah.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.830
I think -- I think
we absolutely do.
Yeah.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.210

There you go.

28:27.210 --> 28:29.000
Yeah.
Okay.

It's all there.

28:30.290 --> 28:31.540

Yeah, we got enough.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.290
Yeah?
What -- What are
you guys gonna do?

28:33.290 --> 28:35.040
We're gonna go to Costa Rica
to visit our friend Ben.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.420
-Oh.
-So -- so, you two guys

28:37.420 --> 28:39.620
named "Ben" have
another friend named Ben?

28:39.620 --> 28:41.040
No.

chill out on the porch here

29:11.170 --> 29:12.290

I promise
I won't bother anybody.

you been all night?

35:55.830 --> 35:57.120
I was stranded.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.620
The engine died, and...

36:00.620 --> 36:01.880
Anyway, it's fine now.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.580
Okay.
Second question.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.670
Yeah?
What did you do to my garage?

36:06.670 --> 36:07.750
I color-coordinated it.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.460
Yes. I noticed.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.830
And now
I can't find anything.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.380
You're welcome.

36:12.380 --> 36:15.460
Hey, that's Marc's bag.
Is he here?

36:15.460 --> 36:17.290
Not anymore.
Came by yesterday.

36:17.290 --> 36:19.210
Wasn't too happy
about being in jail.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.580
Mm-hmm. But lucky for you,
I fixed things.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.210
Convinced him
to call his parents.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.540
And now he's on
a bus back home, so...

36:26.540 --> 36:28.960
You...

36:28.960 --> 36:30.710
you helped him!
Yeah.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.080
Stop. Yes.
Wow!

36:32.080 --> 36:34.420
Oh! Okay.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.000
Yeah. Well, I'm a very
helpful person, Kevin.
Amazing.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.920
And it's all because
I helped you realize

36:39.920 --> 36:42.540
that you needed to help him.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.380
I wanna hit you in the face
with this wrench so bad.

36:45.380 --> 36:46.620
Don't.
Just a tap.

36:46.620 --> 36:47.920
Too -- Hey.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.000
I have a reward for you.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.170
Okay, well, I'm not a dog.

36:50.170 --> 36:51.750
I don't need a reward.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.250
It's not...

36:53.250 --> 36:55.380
Fine.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.540
I mean, you don't want
to help repair any robots...

36:58.540 --> 36:59.540
that's fine.

37:02.170 --> 37:03.460
Robots?

37:03.460 --> 37:05.420
The skunk's got a short.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.250
But I do think that
I could jury-rig something

37:07.250 --> 37:09.040
to make it last
through one performance.

37:09.040 --> 37:09.830
Yvette:
Okay, up a little.

37:09.830 --> 37:11.500

37:11.500 --> 37:13.000
Pull it to your left and up.
Yep.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Okay, good.
Perfect.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.750
Yes. Perfect.
Yeah.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.330
Tyler's gonna melt
like a pad of butter.

37:19.330 --> 37:20.790

you put into this.

nightmares up on stage,

37:25.380 --> 37:26.750
you two will be right back
to the good ol' days.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.790
Yeah.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.960

37:32.960 --> 37:34.250
