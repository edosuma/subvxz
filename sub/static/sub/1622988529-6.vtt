WEBVTT

00:16.265 --> 00:18.519
Two… Two.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.065
What are you doing?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.817
Say, "Working on an aerobics routine."

00:25.901 --> 00:27.611
Or say, "Go fuck yourself."

00:27.694 --> 00:30.280
Nuking popcorn. Come on, man.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.406
What's next? You gonna club a baby seal?

00:32.491 --> 00:35.285
I hear you, Jer,
but don't knock it till you've tried it.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.411
Hot.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.584
-There's butter on this already.
-Yeah. That's how it comes.

00:42.668 --> 00:47.589
Holy shit. What will they think of next?

00:47.673 --> 00:50.384
An actual workable national energy policy?

00:53.428 --> 00:54.513
Yeah.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.307
Don't touch that!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.394
Your hands are greasy.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.814
I just wanted to see
where we are with campaign finance.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.024
Well, I'm happy to tell you.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.235
It just wouldn't make any sense.
It's all in my scrawl.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.653
Well, babe, get this.

01:09.736 --> 01:13.615
Jerry here, of all people,
wants to hire a circus trainer

01:13.699 --> 01:16.910
to come in here and teach me
how to smile for the cameras.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.787
A media consultant, man. Come on.

01:18.871 --> 01:22.749
If we have to do a campaign ad,
we might as well do it right.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.086
-Hire a professional to come in here and--
-Turn me into someone I'm not.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.629
Of course not.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.549
Look, I know guys like Mike Schmidt.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.094
Bear trap jaw, tomato brains.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.346
I used to take orders from them
in the service.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.350
The only way to win is to hit back hard.
Okay?

01:40.434 --> 01:45.022
Hire some pros, make a beautiful ad,
beat them at their own game.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.441
You got the money to spend.
Why not spend it?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.193
Except you don't.

01:49.276 --> 01:53.197
But we're a grassroots campaign.
So, shouldn't this ad reflect that?

01:54.323 --> 01:56.283
What are you even saying?

01:56.783 --> 01:57.784
You wanna slap together

01:57.868 --> 02:01.288
some home movie footage
of the Rubins at the San Diego Zoo?

02:01.371 --> 02:02.789
Call it a day?

02:02.873 --> 02:05.834
No. I'm saying we make
a state-of-the-art video

02:05.918 --> 02:10.797
using the latest video camera technology
that I happen to have access to.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.634
Because my wife

02:14.927 --> 02:18.305
is a stone-cold fox.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.308
I mean, genius.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.144
Don't forget a liar and a thief.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.063
We're talking Betamax, right?

02:33.237 --> 02:34.738
Maya! No, no, not on the road! Maya!

02:34.821 --> 02:36.823
-Okay, Mommy. Hi.
-Hey, hey, hey, Maya.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.075
Hello.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.452
You know not to run on the road.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.797
I owe you an explanation
about the other night.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.842
No, it's all right.
You don't have to tell me. Just…

02:57.219 --> 02:59.388
Are you cheating on Danny?

02:59.471 --> 03:00.973
It's none of my business. But I just--

03:01.056 --> 03:03.308
I don't think I can be friends
with you anymore if you are,

03:03.392 --> 03:05.686
'cause it's not okay to lie like that.

03:05.769 --> 03:09.523
To violate your vows for your own,
whatever, pleasure.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.607
It hurts people.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.526
And maybe you think
that makes me bourgeoise

03:12.609 --> 03:14.111
-or square, or whatever--
-I'm not.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.696
Okay.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.615
So, what were you doing?

03:19.324 --> 03:20.492
I wish you would tell me.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.412
I feel like no one tells me the truth
about anything anymore.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.247
Eating like a pig and throwing up.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.331
Are you really gonna say it?

03:26.415 --> 03:28.625
It's all she'll ever think about
when she sees you, forever.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.085
I have a project.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.089
It's a… exercise tape.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.424
Aerobics.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.633
Something you can do at home

03:36.717 --> 03:40.095
when you can't get childcare
or you just don't want to go to the gym.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.264
And you--
And you can't tell your husband about it?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.850
Just until it's done.
Which it will be soon.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.645
Once he gets a chance to see it,
it'll be different. I think.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.063
-You know how men are.
-Idiots.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.106
-Literal.
-Literal.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.193
Concrete. They only get something
when it's right in front of them.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.653
At least, you know, I hope so.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.157
Yeah. Yeah.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.994
Okay,
so I'm having a color party this weekend.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.748
It's where this woman's gonna come,
and she reads our faces

04:07.831 --> 04:09.082
and tells us what season we are,

04:09.166 --> 04:11.919
and then we know
what shades of makeup look the best on us.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.545
And Ernie doesn't get it either.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.507
But will you come? You-- Will you come?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.425
I'd rather die in a house fire.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.053
I'd love to.

04:21.553 --> 04:25.265
You can't keep doing this.
You can't keep lying.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.976
And you won't.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.938
Just until you have enough.
Until you're done.

04:31.021 --> 04:35.609
One for them, one for you.
And when it's all over, you'll come clean.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.569
Babe, can I talk to you?

04:37.653 --> 04:38.904
I'll be right out.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.656
I'm coming in.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.407
You forgot to lock the fucking door.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.328
You okay?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.830
What? I said I'd be right out.
What's so important?

04:48.914 --> 04:51.208
Is that really what I look like?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.752
In that Mike Schmidt ad?
Like some sloppy little troll.

04:53.836 --> 04:57.089
I mean, how is anyone gonna
take me seriously as a political candidate

04:57.172 --> 04:58.215
if that's what I look like?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.426
Honey, that was a smear campaign.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.053
A lie.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.430
When we make our video,

05:05.514 --> 05:08.433
you're gonna look like
the true hero that you are.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.146
You know, Jerry says
we need to get a pro in here, but…

05:14.690 --> 05:16.400
I think all I need is you.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.236
Just give him what he really wants.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.571
It's been too long.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.781
If you want any freedom at all.

05:22.865 --> 05:24.241
You wanna lock the door?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.202
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.411
Break time.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.748
Yeah. You mean cigarette time.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.918
-Tomato, tomato.
-I don't get it.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.712
-For someone so into fitness…
-You don't have to get it.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.797
-You ever tried to quit?
-I did quit.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.591
And then I started again.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.303
You never kept doing something
you knew you should stop?

06:29.223 --> 06:30.724
Can I ask you something?

06:31.850 --> 06:34.686
Why do you still pretend to like
that husband of yours?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.022
He's not even rich or tall.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.943
He's the most brilliant man
I've ever known.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.112
Yeah. I've never really liked smart dudes.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.948
Smart in the brains, dumb in the dick.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.033
He has some dick smarts.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.869
Mostly, I love what he believes in.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.122
And I do love him, by the way.
I don't pretend.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.834
Can we get back to rehearsing?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.252
We got a whole routine to finish.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.137
I figured if I asked you one question,
you'd clam up.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.685
I'm doing this video for Tyler.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.771
He's all psyched about making
your husband's propaganda video--

07:17.855 --> 07:19.439
-Campaign ad.
-Whatever.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.901
And because I think there's a small chance
it might not be a lame business idea.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.736
I'm not doing this
to be your first gal pal,

07:24.820 --> 07:25.821
so you can relax.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.906
Well, I have a lot of female friends, so.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.034
Found it. I fucking found it.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.703
Perfect location for our shoot.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.829
Sweet-ass natural light,

07:33.912 --> 07:36.456
no mirrors to fuck up my visual jam,
great price.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.418
Nothing. Because that's
all you have to spend. Nothing.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.712
-How much?
-500 bucks.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.173
For two days.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.966
Buddy of mine
is practically giving it away.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.638
Maybe if you open another credit card
just for the month.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.849
Then you pay off the minimum
until some money's come--

07:53.932 --> 07:56.518
Oh, my God. You're such a good friend.
Thank you for coming.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.604
Of course. Are you okay?

07:58.687 --> 08:01.481
No, I did something. It is bad.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.650
Promise not to think I'm a monster?

08:03.734 --> 08:05.527
She thinks she's the monster?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.237
Don't be silly.

08:10.616 --> 08:11.825
They said it was all-natural

08:11.909 --> 08:13.577
and that my face
was going to heal quickly.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.580
And I guess
I just had a bad reaction to the acid.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.665
You dipped your face in acid?

08:18.749 --> 08:21.335
Worse, I paid someone else
to dip my face in acid.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.922
A Russian gal
that some of the girls at the club use.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.925
Okay, so how bad is it?

08:31.470 --> 08:33.263
-It's not that bad.
-Oh, my God.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.892
My face was my one good thing,
and I went and ruined it.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.561
That's not true. You're gorgeous.

08:39.645 --> 08:42.856
You have gorgeous hair,
and you're a gorgeous person.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.066
Inside and out.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.152
And your face will get better.
I mean, isn't that the whole point?

08:47.236 --> 08:49.488
Once it heals,
it's better than it was before?

08:50.572 --> 08:51.573
It's like muscles.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.367
You make them sore,
and then they grow back.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.535
Stronger.

08:55.953 --> 08:56.954
Thanks.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.083
I got Ernie a new video camera.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.127
Steady. Steady eyes. Steady mouth.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.547
Yeah? Is he happy?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.841
No, not really.
He's still mad about the other one.

09:08.924 --> 09:12.886
And I can't understand
how a video camera has sentimental value.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.431
And now I got to host this party
with this face. I just--

09:16.515 --> 09:18.392
The only thing
getting me through it right now

09:18.475 --> 09:20.018
is knowing that you're gonna be there.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.937
And waffles.
If I make waffles, will you have?

09:22.855 --> 09:24.690
You're not getting out of this one.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.774
'Course.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.610
So, one more time.

09:28.694 --> 09:32.781
We can't mention Bunny
or any of the aerobic stuff to my husband.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.908
Okay? That's my business.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.120
Our business. Not his.

09:38.203 --> 09:42.249
So when we're here, we just stick to
campaign video talk, okay?

09:45.669 --> 09:46.670
Mint.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.964
In the salsa.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.717
I've had ten of these in the last week.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.135
No. Fourteen.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.512
Doing a full-on mouth autopsy
on these bad boys

09:55.596 --> 09:57.681
to determine the salsa components.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.183
It's mint. Definitely.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.728
Hey, Tyler.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.814
Did you hear anything I just said?

10:05.898 --> 10:07.191
Won't say a word.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.068
Hence, enormous burrito to occupy mi boca.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.572
You're trusting this ding-dong
with your marriage. Your life.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.699
Tyler has a small crew, lights, sound,

10:15.782 --> 10:18.535
and a very nimble
and portable video camera.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.828
We get the locations for free.

10:19.912 --> 10:23.415
You don't have to worry about money
or anything to get the permits.

10:23.916 --> 10:27.336
And you're sure the video format--
It's okay for television?

10:28.045 --> 10:30.214
-Yeah, broadcast quality.
-Excuse me?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.257
Broadcast quality.

10:32.341 --> 10:35.010
Six-hour shoot,
which we can bring in for our budget.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.637
-How do you know that?
-Research.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.931
Okay, all right. Wow.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.224
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Jerry. That--

10:40.307 --> 10:42.059
-That was really nice…
-It is nice.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.020
-…but I think I'm good now. I'm good.
-You feel good. Tight.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.730
-Thank you, yeah.
-Hey, Jer.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.106
She said stop.

10:48.190 --> 10:51.026
Sorry. I thought she was into it.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.028
No, no, I totally was.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.863
That was really great. Thank you so much.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.658
Yeah, you girls are
just working your butts off.

10:57.741 --> 10:58.825
Just trying to help.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.621
And I would really love it if we could get
the beach in this, like, as much as I can.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.207
And one thing I was thinking about: music.

11:05.290 --> 11:09.253
Yes. Totally. Like drums.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.337
Yes. Exactly.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.257
Like, something with, like,
a really groovy kick-ass drive to it.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.260
-Something progressive.
-Yeah. Funky. Draws people in.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.345
Yeah. You know, something that says,

11:18.428 --> 11:21.473
"This isn't about a campaign.
This is about a movement."

11:21.557 --> 11:24.518
No, no, no. We need to distance you
from the stoner counterculture,

11:24.601 --> 11:25.853
not play into it.

11:25.936 --> 11:29.064
It's time to sand off
those Bohemian edges.

11:29.147 --> 11:32.025
Show these San Diegans
the polished-professional-you,

11:32.109 --> 11:33.777
not the Berkeley-radical-you.

11:33.861 --> 11:37.072
So, what are we saying? Sell me out?

11:37.155 --> 11:40.784
No, sell you smart. Get you in a suit.
Maybe a hard hat.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.744
For a conservation platform?

11:42.828 --> 11:46.039
I am anti-coastal development,
and you want me in a hard hat?

11:46.123 --> 11:48.417
You're a progressive.
You wanna invest in--

11:48.500 --> 11:51.378
in social infrastructure,
schools, health care.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.463
People do love a dude in a hard hat.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.090
Don't know why.

11:55.174 --> 11:59.219
Big heads. Ever see an actor?
Biggest bobbleheads in the world, man.

11:59.303 --> 12:04.433
Okay, I am not putting on a blue suit
like a goddamn FBI goon.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.767
Not blue.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.519
Gray.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.522
Out in the water,
you know who the gray suits are?

12:11.106 --> 12:12.149
The sharks.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.819
Predators. Not prey.

12:16.528 --> 12:20.699
I mean, we could stick to the old Danny
or we could try something different.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.952
Well, what do you think?

12:28.332 --> 12:30.959
I bet the ladies
would love you in a suit, man.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.421
I could drown you
and make it look like an accident.

12:34.505 --> 12:35.964
If that's what it takes.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.427
I suppose we're going to the goddamn mall.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.014
I don't know about this.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.935
I don't know if I'm a suit guy.
I look like a junior rabbi.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.271
Come-- Just come out here. Let me see.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.985
Junior rabbi was pretty dead-on.

12:57.861 --> 12:58.862
Well?

12:59.947 --> 13:04.409
I think you look like a man
ready to take Sacramento by storm.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.537
Really?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.163
With these shoulder pads?

13:08.247 --> 13:10.290
Especially with those shoulder pads.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.918
-I don't know.
-You look sharp.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.294
Doesn't he look sharp?

13:14.878 --> 13:17.422
With the appropriate alterations,
we can get it there.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.258
I can get that pinned up for you.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.176
What's the special occasion?

13:21.260 --> 13:22.761
Attending a wedding? Bar mitzvah?

13:25.222 --> 13:27.015
He's a candidate for State Assembly.

13:27.099 --> 13:30.394
And his name is Danny Rubin,
and he's gonna win.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.605
And are we going to be paying
by personal check or credit?

13:34.356 --> 13:35.357
Credit.

13:37.484 --> 13:43.282
Look at all these dutiful sheep
heeding the capitalist call. You know?

13:45.242 --> 13:47.786
Spending their dwindling
middle-class salaries

13:47.870 --> 13:51.081
on poorly made goods
that they'll throw into a landfill

13:51.164 --> 13:53.917
-when they realize how unsatisfied…
-The garage is down here.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.335
-…they still feel. What?
-Down here.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.670
The garage.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.463
I mean, look at the atrium.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.757
It's like a goddamn church, Sheila.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.470
That's not a coincidence, you know?
Worshipping the almighty dollar.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.140
Well, what the shit is this?

14:10.392 --> 14:11.935
Fucking unbelievable.

14:12.019 --> 14:17.524
Classic cycle of grift and corruption.
Don't know why you're so surprised, man.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.610
It's the shamelessness of it.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.362
It's called the "community room,"
designated that way by the city.

14:22.446 --> 14:26.658
And yet Breem just hands it over
to his goddamn candidate.

14:26.742 --> 14:29.328
You know, legally,
you're entitled to an equal share

14:29.411 --> 14:31.038
of any community space.

14:31.622 --> 14:34.249
-That sounds true.
-It's definitely true.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.710
I know my way around planning codes.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.379
Years of fighting slumlords in Oakland.

14:39.463 --> 14:42.883
Do we even want an office
in that mall anyway?

14:42.966 --> 14:45.427
I mean, you were there for an hour
and you were miserable.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.431
Yes. It's the principle of it.
You know what I think we should do?

14:49.515 --> 14:50.933
I think we should go down there,

14:51.016 --> 14:53.352
and we should confront
this Breem gentleman.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.436
Mano a mano.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.773
One pair of shoulder pads
and he's suddenly John Wayne.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.858
I love this idea.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.194
I mean, full disclosure…

15:03.195 --> 15:06.281
I've had several beers,
and this is my second skunk stick.

15:06.365 --> 15:10.786
But tomorrow we go give that guy
a piece of our mind.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.454
That's enemy territory.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.248
That's not what this campaign is about.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.416
That's not what you're about.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.087
You spend a fair amount of time
in that place, don't you, Sheil?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.882
Is that where you do your jazz dancing
and whatnot?

15:26.385 --> 15:28.595
Is that what you're about, Sheil?

15:29.555 --> 15:31.348
Is he gonna let him talk to you like that?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.432
Jerry…

15:33.308 --> 15:37.271
let me get a hit of that joint.
This day just took it right out of me.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.189
You're damn right, he is.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.615
I'm not some monster
out to chew up the environment

15:48.699 --> 15:50.576
in service to my greed.

15:50.659 --> 15:53.871
I'm a lover of the outdoors,
and of the coastline in particular.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.832
I just don't believe in letting the ocean
call the shots.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.835
Is that what you were going to say
in the debate before Danny shut you down?

16:02.754 --> 16:05.507
Your husband got in a few good lines
at my expense, that's for sure.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.217
I don't know that he's shut me down.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.927
Well, you certainly got the last laugh.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.890
Funding the opposition's campaign ad.
Must have cost you a pretty penny.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.436
It was a worthwhile investment
in the future.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.189
Whose future, exactly?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.066
The future of our community.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.944
And of my company, of course.

16:27.196 --> 16:30.157
I don't have all the money in the world
just sitting around.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.995
Every new project incurs substantial risk,
significant leverage.

16:35.078 --> 16:39.124
I put everything on the line every time
I embark on a new Breem Team experience.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.669
That is the truth.
Contrary to what you may think of me.

16:43.754 --> 16:48.008
I don't think of you, really. At all.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.346
Right.

16:53.889 --> 16:57.100
You came to me about equity
concerning use of the community room.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.810
You were right
to bring that to my attention.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.563
I'm not going to ask
the Schmidt campaign to move,

17:01.647 --> 17:04.398
but I can offer you
access to an alternative space

17:04.483 --> 17:05.526
that's currently vacant.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.609
If it meets your needs.

17:07.819 --> 17:08.819
Follow me.

17:10.489 --> 17:11.490
This way.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.585
This place is perfect for Danny.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.257
But it's even better for you.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.299
Are you guys fucking stoked on this?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.051
Totally fucking stoked.

18:56.512 --> 18:57.638
Hello?

18:57.721 --> 18:59.306
Looking for some feedback over here.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.142
It would be really helpful to know
if you're stoked or bummed.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.604
I put my fucking heart into this.
I'm pretty fucking proud of it.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.898
But if you're bummed, you're bummed.
I mean, it is what it is.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.358
Tyler.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.819
I'm not bummed.

19:14.363 --> 19:16.240
I fucking knew you'd be stoked.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.033
How could you not be?
We fucking nailed it.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.868
-This thing is sick.
-It's sick.

19:19.952 --> 19:22.996
-It's totally sick, babe.
-You're sick, babe.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.124
This calls for a celebration.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.211
Still a couple final sound things
I want to smooth out, but then,

19:29.294 --> 19:32.589
I say we fire up on dupe and distrib.
Get this baby out there.

19:32.673 --> 19:33.882
These new duplicators are out.

19:33.966 --> 19:36.218
Little pricey, but so fucking sweet.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.761
-How pricey?
-Ten grand.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.973
Or we get a post house to do it for us
through my independent film contacts.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.683
-He's talking about porno.
-I know.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.728
It's around five grand a run.
Four if they bro me.

19:46.812 --> 19:49.147
Five grand. Four if they "bro" him.

19:49.857 --> 19:52.192
So you dig a little deeper,
just a little longer.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.694
How many more can you make on this?

19:54.987 --> 19:55.988
Only a few.

19:56.071 --> 19:59.241
But the quality goes down every time.
That's just too painful.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.702
And I can't degrade you girls like that.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.288
Cheers.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.372
Cheers.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.126
Let's watch it again.

20:12.754 --> 20:18.051
Unlocking your best self
comes down to discovering your season.

20:18.135 --> 20:23.515
Learning whether you're an autumn,
winter, fall or spring.

20:23.599 --> 20:27.895
Whether blue is your best friend
or brown is your enemy.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.646
Take Greta here.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.607
This is a beautiful scarf.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.861
Or I'm sure it looked like one
on the rack.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.907
But do you see how it enhances
all the wrong elements in her skin?

20:39.990 --> 20:41.241
Good God.

20:41.825 --> 20:45.996
It was a gift from my sister.
I didn't pick it.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.665
Let's talk about makeup palette.

20:49.208 --> 20:54.671
Greta's got a brownish shade
on her lips and lids.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.758
Egyptian Sunset.
I've been wearing it since high school.

20:57.841 --> 21:01.094
But what you should be wearing
is the exact opposite.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.055
Soft pink.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.681
Really? I didn't know.

21:04.765 --> 21:05.933
I'm so embarrassed.

21:06.016 --> 21:10.437
With the Color Me Alluring system,
you'll receive a personal road map

21:10.521 --> 21:13.440
that takes all the guesswork
out of your color choices.

21:14.024 --> 21:18.320
Who knows?
You might just discover a whole new hue.

21:19.780 --> 21:23.325
But before we start the process,
any questions so far?

21:23.408 --> 21:25.244
You have to. You have to.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.328
I have one.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.541
Is everyone here really buying this?

21:30.624 --> 21:33.502
Sounds like someone
may have hit the sangria a little hard.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.755
Being your personal best
is not about seasonal eye shadow.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.715
It's about what's underneath your clothes.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.342
Underneath your skin.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.720
-Sheila, are you feeling okay?
-I am, actually.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.056
I'm feeling better than I have
in quite some time.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.643
The only way
to truly feel good about yourself

21:49.726 --> 21:51.770
is to stop worrying
about what's on the outside,

21:51.854 --> 21:54.314
and get in touch
with what's on the inside.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.650
And I'm talking about your heart,
your muscles.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.735
I'm talking about getting strong.

21:58.819 --> 22:01.446
And I can tell you all think
that I'm crazy, and maybe I am.

22:01.530 --> 22:06.368
But what if instead of talking about it,
I showed you?

22:08.245 --> 22:09.788
Greta, would you mind?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.523
-Thank you.
-All right.

22:36.607 --> 22:37.816
-Thank you, Sheila.
-Thank you, Vicki.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.067
-Thank you, Maria.
-Thank you.

22:39.151 --> 22:40.152
Well, bye.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.573
That's the last of the copies
that I have on me,

22:44.656 --> 22:46.533
but I'll let you know
when I can mail yours out.

22:46.617 --> 22:47.701
-I have both your numbers.
-Okay.

22:47.784 --> 22:48.785
So thanks, ladies.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.204
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.623
Wow. So exciting.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.421
Well, that's not how I thought
this afternoon was gonna go.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.631
-Me either!
-Yeah.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.883
I guess I sort of ended up taking over.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.635
I hope I-- Vicki wasn't too offended.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.637
I don't know what came over me.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.388
I was just so excited to share the video,

23:08.472 --> 23:11.099
and then when everyone else got excited,
it felt like an opportunity.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.352
Ernie's camera went missing
right after you came over.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.647
It never occurred to me
that you would take it.

23:16.730 --> 23:20.192
But it also never occurred to me
that you'd hijack a tea party. So…

23:22.402 --> 23:23.612
Did you?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.657
Did you take Ernie's camera?

23:28.825 --> 23:31.411
She sees you. She sees what you are.

23:32.788 --> 23:35.707
I don't want to say. I was…

23:35.791 --> 23:39.586
A selfish, stupid, fat liar. A greedy cow.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.840
I was-- It was wrong.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.552
I was wrong. I just--
I just meant to borrow it.

23:46.635 --> 23:47.636
And…

23:48.512 --> 23:51.640
you said Ernie has more gadgets
than he knew what to do with

23:51.723 --> 23:56.144
and I just honestly thought
that no one would even notice.

23:56.228 --> 23:57.604
-It was so--
-Okay, well, he noticed.

23:57.688 --> 24:00.107
And he fired Miriam.
And she has three kids.

24:00.941 --> 24:04.069
Maybe even four.
I know she has a number of children.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.404
I felt really awful.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.949
I really did.
I kept meaning to come clean.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.492
-And--
-But you never did.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.496
Well, I--

24:15.747 --> 24:17.875
There's-- I have a reason.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.835
Okay. What?

24:19.918 --> 24:23.130
You can't tell her about the tape.
It isn't your story to tell.

24:23.213 --> 24:26.175
You are not leaving this driveway
until you tell me what it is.

24:30.012 --> 24:33.140
What, are you gonna try to distract me
with one of your workout tapes? I'm not…

24:33.223 --> 24:36.268
I didn't make this tape. Your husband did.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.314
I don't think it's what you're expecting.
In fact, I know it isn't.

24:40.397 --> 24:41.481
-So I--
-You can go now.

24:41.565 --> 24:42.900
-Greta, please.
-I said go.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.027
Get out.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.203
I gotta admit,
I was worried about the suit.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.663
-But if you fucking squint your eyes…
-Hey. Sorry I'm so late.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.041
-Greta's party ran a little long.
-…I look like a Jewish Kennedy.

24:59.124 --> 25:01.543
-Even I wanna fuck me.
-That's what I'm saying.

25:01.627 --> 25:05.589
-Do you like the ad?
-No, we don't like it, Sheil.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.424
We love it.

25:07.508 --> 25:09.843
I mean, this is a ten-strike.

25:09.927 --> 25:11.637
I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.432
I mean, this is the guy, right here.
Taking names. Owning it.

25:15.516 --> 25:17.184
I'm happy you're happy.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.436
You know, a spot like this
deserves a much bigger ad buy

25:19.520 --> 25:20.562
than what we were planning.

25:21.146 --> 25:23.482
-What are you thinking?
-I don't know. Six, seven thou.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.942
I mean, this is a rocket ship

25:25.025 --> 25:26.109
-to Sacramento, man.
-Yeah.

25:26.902 --> 25:29.154
I'm not sure we've got that
in the budget, but--

25:29.238 --> 25:30.531
No. We definitely have it.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.824
It's here, in your own handwriting.

25:35.244 --> 25:37.746
-Wait, this is my favorite part.
-I love it.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.998
-You were joking about…
-I know, don't…

25:40.832 --> 25:43.460
Knee, punch, kick. Knee, punch, kick.
