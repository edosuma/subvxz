00:06.974 --> 00:10.711
(Mozart's "Requiem Mass"
playing)

00:14.482 --> 00:15.783
(grunting)

00:18.652 --> 00:20.154
(moaning)

00:20.188 --> 00:22.190
(music intensifies)

00:23.524 --> 00:25.459
(man gasping)

00:30.398 --> 00:32.600
(whispering):
I forgive you.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.442
(heart beating rhythmically)

00:41.475 --> 00:42.443
(man gasping)

00:42.476 --> 00:44.812
(music stops)

00:44.845 --> 00:46.480
(whooping, laughter)

00:46.514 --> 00:47.515
You guys
didn't have to do this.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.749
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

00:48.782 --> 00:50.284
You're a
famous author.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.286
I like this.
-Aw, it's just a galley.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.621
DON: The Attraction Equation--

00:53.654 --> 00:55.856
Being Popular Is
As Easy As Pi.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.824
Wait a second,
I thought

00:56.857 --> 00:59.293
the paper you published
had a different title.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.461
No?
AMITA: It did.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.164
It was called,
"A Mathematical Analysis

01:03.197 --> 01:04.232
of Friendship
Dynamics."

01:04.265 --> 01:05.333
Right.
Yeah, but

01:05.366 --> 01:06.467
the publisher thought

01:06.500 --> 01:08.869
that this title had more "zazz."

01:08.902 --> 01:10.204
Cheers.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.272
ALAN:
Oh, hi, guys.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.406
Hey, Alan.
Hey.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.607
What's up?
-Uh, Charlie, Hey.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.576
uh, once again belated
congratulations.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.345
Thank you, Dad.
-Would you like some champagne?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.479
Ooh, yeah.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.248
Actually, no, I can't.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.316
I have another problem set
for Galuski's class.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.784
It's due on Monday.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.553
I'm just auditing
the class

01:25.586 --> 01:26.887
and look at this, uh,
workload of mine.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.256
I mean, how do these kids do it?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.490
They're kids.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.591
Mm...

01:32.493 --> 01:34.128
I don't think I actually
remember us

01:34.162 --> 01:35.429
ever double dating.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.530
LIZ:
What?!

01:36.564 --> 01:38.332
All these years, it must've
happened at least once.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.900
Uh, there was
one time.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.901
Yeah.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.203
I was eight
years old.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.337
I had Michelle
Mazur over...

01:43.371 --> 01:44.438
You took

01:44.472 --> 01:45.773
the babysitter
into the garage--

01:45.806 --> 01:47.341
(phone rings)
That's right, she was cute, too.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.309
I remember her.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.743
How'd you know that
he took the babysitter

01:49.777 --> 01:51.379
in the garage?
Well, I was eight

01:51.412 --> 01:53.381
and I used to spy on my brother
a little bit.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.348
DON:
All right. Right.

01:54.382 --> 01:55.683
We're on our way.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.351
You know what?
We gotta go.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.652
You should probably come
with us.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.356
(helicopter blades whirring)

02:02.390 --> 02:03.857
DAVID:
Victim's name is Peter Guzman,

02:03.891 --> 02:05.193
stock analyst.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.360
Maintenance guys
found him.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.528
He was tortured first.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.663
Coroner thinks
for about 36 hours.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.665
Right, so, same MO
as the first.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.434
Andrew Chang, 39.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.702
Three weeks ago,
he was murdered

02:14.735 --> 02:16.237
in a school gymnasium.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.538
Kids come in for
Monday morning PE,

02:17.571 --> 02:19.507
they find the body.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.342
Score one
for the therapy industry.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.710
(helicopter hovering)

02:29.217 --> 02:31.419
LIZ:
Isaiah, Chapter 53.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.187
The Old Testament.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.588
Similar verse
was found

02:34.622 --> 02:36.324
at the first crime scene.
DON: Yeah,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.459
"He was despised and
rejected by men,"

02:38.492 --> 02:40.461
I-53, as well.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.496
Both times,
killer left a CD playing.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.498
Same piece of music.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.301
("Requiem" begins playing)

02:47.335 --> 02:49.403
LIZ: That's Mozart's "Requiem
Mass."

02:49.437 --> 02:51.439
It's a prayer
for the dead.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.342
Guy kills his victims
with a drug cocktail,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.544
succinylcholine and aconite.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.746
It causes paralysis
and asphyxiation.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.880
Killer also

02:59.913 --> 03:02.483
stuffed this
down the victim's throat.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.319
Looks like a piece
of a phone book, huh?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.488
Yeah. Guzman's name
is circled.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.889
Same as the
first victim.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.558
He's telling us if you're
in the phone book,

03:10.591 --> 03:11.992
you could be next.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.193
What are you thinking,
there, Char?

03:13.227 --> 03:15.829
I don't know-- seems like
it's not just about the numbers.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.631
You know,
the elements

03:17.665 --> 03:19.267
of the design
are just as important.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.237
Uh...

03:23.271 --> 03:24.972
Do you have a picture
of the number grid

03:25.005 --> 03:27.541
from the first
killing?

03:27.575 --> 03:29.477
It's a Fibonacci sequence.
-Yeah?

03:29.510 --> 03:33.347
Yeah, which continues
from this first grid here...

03:33.381 --> 03:36.350
to this second grid
here on the wall.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.385
Uh...

03:41.422 --> 03:43.691
...except for one thing.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.025
What's that?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.861
Between this first
and second grid,

03:47.895 --> 03:50.898
there's a number series
missing.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.600
You, do you
have a... yeah.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.402
Uh...

03:54.435 --> 03:55.369
Five...

03:56.604 --> 03:57.938
There.
DON: That's it?

03:57.971 --> 03:58.939
Yeah.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.275
It's the victim's

04:01.309 --> 04:03.311
cell phone number.
-But the killer did

04:03.344 --> 04:04.578
this first grid
three weeks ago.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.780
Which means he knew
the phone number then.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.482
He had the second victim
already picked out

04:08.516 --> 04:10.351
when he killed the first.
-So, if there's

04:10.384 --> 04:11.585
another grid, then...
The next number

04:11.619 --> 04:13.287
series could be our next victim.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.623
Um... just hold on.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.528
You got it?
There it is, yeah.

04:20.561 --> 04:21.829
David, you get a trace on this.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.931
Got it.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.567
Yeah, this is
David Sinclair.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.601
I need you to
run a trace.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.537
(phone ringing)

04:29.570 --> 04:32.473
("Requiem" playing)

04:32.506 --> 04:35.008
(man groaning in background)

04:35.042 --> 04:37.511
Hello?

04:38.612 --> 04:41.315
(panicked moaning)

04:41.349 --> 04:42.850
(moaning continues)

04:44.985 --> 04:47.755
Number belongs to a
Thad Esmond, he's 34.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.558
Wife reported him missing
12 hours ago.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.526
12 hours-- if the killer
stays true to form,

04:52.560 --> 04:53.661
that gives us about a day.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.878
Thad went for a run
before breakfast yesterday.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.846
Never came back.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.848
And have you noticed
anything odd?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.850
Like a... a strange car
outside the house,

05:16.884 --> 05:18.886
or someone following
you or your husband?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.754
Driving to work last week,

05:20.788 --> 05:22.556
Thad did think someone
was following him.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.558
And did he say
what the car looked like?

05:24.592 --> 05:26.827
Did he tell why he thought
the car might be following him?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.929
Thad's a labor lawyer,

05:28.962 --> 05:30.931
organizing janitors,

05:30.964 --> 05:32.500
hotel workers.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.435
He's, uh, he's dealt
with employer intimidation.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.470
He chalked it up
to that.

05:36.504 --> 05:40.641
I told all of this
to Missing Persons.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.510
You did great.
I-I have all of this here.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.412
I'm just trying to, um...

05:44.445 --> 05:47.014
make sure that I square away
all the facts.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.349
Whatever you're not saying...

05:50.584 --> 05:52.520
...please,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.522
promise me you will find
my husband.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.058
DAVID:
The killer deactivated

05:58.091 --> 05:59.560
Thad Esmond's
cell phone GPS,

05:59.593 --> 06:01.061
but we were able
to trace the call

06:01.094 --> 06:02.863
to a cell tower in
the downtown area.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.031
And the drugs?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.165
Yeah, the cocktail
is specific.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.601
And the I.V. suggests some
kind of medical training.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.036
So, we're checking
into hospitals

06:09.069 --> 06:10.738
for possible theft.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.573
And here's the lab
report on the paint.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.074
It's the real deal--
gold leaf,

06:14.107 --> 06:15.876
the pigment is only
used by restorers.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.945
Only a couple of art stores
actually carry the stuff.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.079
Yeah, all right, well,

06:19.112 --> 06:21.148
why don't you get Colby
to help you.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.584
He's sticking
around?

06:23.617 --> 06:25.553
We'll see.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.993
(man screaming) MEGAN (echoes):
Stop, that's enough.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.928
He'll say anything you want.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.666
This has to stop now!

06:38.699 --> 06:40.701
This is not
what I signed up for.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.002
(screams fading)

06:43.103 --> 06:45.038
Hi, Larry.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.708
Hey, Megan.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.677
You, um...

06:49.710 --> 06:52.446
taking a break
from monastic utopia?

06:52.480 --> 06:54.882
You really don't recall, do you?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.150
We were supposed to meet
for lunch.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.520
Uh... it's, uh...

06:59.553 --> 07:01.789
it's just the case,
it's really, um...

07:01.822 --> 07:02.790
Yes, consuming.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.224
I can see it on your face.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.660
You know, you used
that word utopia--

07:06.694 --> 07:08.796
that's from Greek,
meaning "no place."

07:08.829 --> 07:11.632
Sir Thomas More conceived
utopia as a...

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
rather sardonic joke

07:13.667 --> 07:15.636
meaning, "no place
is a good place."

07:15.669 --> 07:17.905
I'm not sure that I follow.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.741
Well, you and I have agreed

07:20.774 --> 07:23.010
to inhabit
a similarly ambiguous locus--

07:23.043 --> 07:25.012
the land of no place--
and, uh...

07:25.045 --> 07:27.014
well, if you ever need someone
to talk to.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.683
DON:
Hey, Larry.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.519
So?

07:31.552 --> 07:32.753
What do we got?
-Um,

07:32.786 --> 07:33.921
I-I got a blend.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.255
I got a bunch of Bible verses

07:35.288 --> 07:37.257
about rejection,
and self-loathing.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.926
Plus all this imagery
and I'd say

07:38.959 --> 07:40.561
religion was definitely a part
of his upbringing,

07:40.594 --> 07:42.830
and then all the failures
in life and love

07:42.863 --> 07:44.765
come and just pushed him
over the edge.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.033
And his faith

07:46.066 --> 07:47.668
pursued a darker path.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.003
And now he's just daring us
to find him.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.139
And the blend of the religion

07:52.172 --> 07:54.742
and the occult suggest
he might be using some kind

07:54.775 --> 07:55.876
of Bible numerology,

07:55.909 --> 07:58.011
and I'm really hoping
that you can help us with that.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.980
How?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.716
Numerology isn't math.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.785
Numerology is... nonsense.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.754
Well, whatever system

08:06.787 --> 08:08.722
he's using may hold
no meaning for you,

08:08.756 --> 08:10.824
but it certainly
holds meaning for him.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.793
Thanks, Larry. Fine.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.294
I'm gonna have to get
in contact with somebody.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.663
What is the name

08:15.696 --> 08:18.666
of that Religion and Philosophy
professor?

08:18.699 --> 08:19.700
Alex Trowbridge?

08:19.733 --> 08:22.202
Love that name.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.304
Just sounds like
some "Mr. Chips" guy

08:24.337 --> 08:26.306
with the elbow patches

08:26.339 --> 08:27.741
and crumpets.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.848
So, Professor, do you
think you can help us?

08:34.882 --> 08:35.883
Alex.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.751
And I am at your disposal.

08:37.785 --> 08:38.719
Alex.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.788
I read your paper.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.790
And can't wait for the book.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.758
You know, but, frankly,
I find it hard to believe

08:44.792 --> 08:47.595
that you ever had any trouble
making friends.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.562
(chuckles)

08:48.596 --> 08:50.964
Oh, Alex, you didn't know me
when I was 13.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.100
So...

08:53.133 --> 08:55.836
did you get the crime scene
photos I e-mailed to you?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.838
Uh, yeah, I did.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.840
And, uh, I think
that there's merit

08:59.873 --> 09:01.241
to the numerology
theory.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.877
The square grid, the
nature references--

09:03.911 --> 09:05.879
four is the number
of creation--

09:05.913 --> 09:07.347
the four elements,
the four seasons--

09:07.380 --> 09:09.883
and it's the same thing
with the seven numbers.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.586
You know, seven is the number
of spiritual perfection,

09:12.620 --> 09:14.888
seven colors in the spectrum,

09:14.922 --> 09:17.591
and seven days
of the week.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.759
You don't believe
any of this, do you?

09:18.792 --> 09:19.827
What, that numbers
are spiritual

09:19.860 --> 09:20.961
and magical and mystical?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.696
Uh... no.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.764
I'm a mathematician.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.299
What about Fibonacci numbers,
the golden ratio.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.735
No, I mean,
there is evidence

09:27.768 --> 09:30.337
that math occurs spontaneously
in nature

09:30.370 --> 09:31.739
and in art.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.741
And I do acknowledge
that there is some mystery

09:33.774 --> 09:36.009
to that,
some beauty to that, but...

09:36.043 --> 09:38.078
Still you see no reason to
believe that may be evidence

09:38.111 --> 09:39.913
of some higher order?
Yeah...

09:39.947 --> 09:41.248
No.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.716
No, I call it math.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.818
Okay, so,
what does this killer call it?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.221
You asked me to help, Professor.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.223
You're right. I'm sorry.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.959
Okay.
So,

09:51.992 --> 09:52.826
what's your conclusion?

09:52.860 --> 09:56.764
Well, the verses may be
part of a code,

09:56.797 --> 09:58.632
linked by a
key number.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.901
One is the number of unity.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.270
I suggest you start there.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.738
At one.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.206
Mm-hmm.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.409
So, are you going
to say anything?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.378
About what?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.914
Alex Trowbridge.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.048
Well, what's to say?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.751
She's nice,
she's stimulating.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.853
I mean, she's a stimulating
conversationalist.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.122
And hot.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.992
I... I don't...
(laughs nervously)

10:25.025 --> 10:27.828
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.129
No. I'm glad you're here.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.798
Good, hope you
feel the same way

10:30.831 --> 10:32.933
after I ask
what I'm going to ask.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.868
Uh... Galuski's
engineering class.

10:34.902 --> 10:35.936
These thermodynamics
problem sets

10:35.969 --> 10:38.071
are just killing me, Charlie.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.973
All right, why? What is it?
-It's all this about

10:40.007 --> 10:42.976
the effect of freezing water
on bridges, you know, expansion.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.878
Uh-huh.
-Now, from what I can tell,

10:44.912 --> 10:47.247
the equations don't account for
the use of salt on roadways.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.449
Now, I've got 30 years

10:49.482 --> 10:50.851
experience as an urban planner.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.853
This math doesn't make
any sense.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.322
All right,
it's a little crazy right now,

10:55.355 --> 10:59.426
but I can take a look at it
when I can take a look at it.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.161
Okay, thanks.
Uh, ooh...

11:01.194 --> 11:03.163
Don tells me you had a meeting
with Alex Trowbridge, huh?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.398
Right.
-Word on campus is

11:05.432 --> 11:06.900
she's quite a looker.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.168
Dad, we're, you know...
we're working here, so...

11:08.201 --> 11:09.903
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm out of here.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.006
You ever see that
Rodney Dangerfield movie,

11:13.040 --> 11:14.942
Back to School?

11:14.975 --> 11:15.876
No, why?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.177
Forget it.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.280
You know, this "non-math"
is driving me insane.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.050
Seriously, how am I supposed
to find a key number

11:23.083 --> 11:25.052
when I don't even know what
the hell I'm looking for?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.920
I-53.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.257
Didn't Alex tell you
that in numerology,

11:30.290 --> 11:33.226
numbers and letters
are often interchangeable?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.196
Yeah, so I-53 would be,
what, 153?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.767
All right, it's worth a shot.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.902
I can put it in the primary tier
of encryption schema.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.403
CHARLIE: Let's see if we can't
decode

11:43.436 --> 11:44.371
this Bible scripture verse.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.744
It's a Web address.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.812
You're a genius.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.913
And hot, too.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.282
Don't forget that.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.985
Check it out,
the link's giving us a location.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.123
All right, we got ya.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.893
So SWAT will be
here in five.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.029
Killer tortured
his last victim for 36 hours.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.964
We're already 30 hours in.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.133
I say we don't wait
another minute.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.971
(door squeaks)

12:20.473 --> 12:22.042
(bottle clatters)

12:22.075 --> 12:23.977
You hear that?
Yeah.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.952
FBI! Hands up!

12:31.985 --> 12:34.187
I was sleeping, man!
That's all!

12:34.221 --> 12:36.223
I thought you were him.
-Who?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.058
I didn't see him. I hid.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.961
The screams,
they came from up there.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.936
("Requiem" playing in distance)

12:50.037 --> 12:52.472
(music grows louder)

13:15.896 --> 13:18.031
Guy's messing with us.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.536
Matthew, Chapter 28,
the New Testament.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.380
(music continues)

13:38.886 --> 13:40.220
(groans)

13:40.253 --> 13:41.521
What is it?

13:41.554 --> 13:45.158
He left us that head
'cause he took this one.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.931
Charlie says the numbers
are all different;

13:50.964 --> 13:52.365
he doesn't see
any pattern.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.534
He changed his method.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.436
The first two killed
by drug cocktail,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.071
and then Thad Esmond
is beheaded.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.873
Serial killers don't
usually alter their MOs

13:59.907 --> 14:02.242
dramatically.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.211
All right, so what do
you think the reason is?

14:06.313 --> 14:08.181
Oh, I should
be the one.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.084
No, no, no, I'll do it.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.337
(sobbing)

14:34.207 --> 14:37.144
("Requiem" playing)

14:45.252 --> 14:48.388
MEGAN:
"Lo, I am with you always."

14:59.499 --> 15:01.501
(music continues)

15:14.081 --> 15:16.016
(music intensifies)

15:19.219 --> 15:21.688
He's killing his apostles.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.291
Andrew, Peter and Thaddeus--

15:24.324 --> 15:26.293
all the names
of Christ's apostles,

15:26.326 --> 15:28.228
all killed like their namesakes.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.229
Like martyrs.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.232
And most serial killers
get off on playing God.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.367
What, he thinks he is?

15:34.401 --> 15:37.004
"Lo, I am with you always,
even unto the end of the world."

15:37.037 --> 15:38.571
I think he's calling
all of his apostles

15:38.605 --> 15:41.141
to him, for eternity.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.276
But he's also
sending us a message...

15:43.310 --> 15:45.278
that he's going to be around
for a while.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.381
There's three dead,
but there are 12 apostles.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.983
So, what, nine more names.

15:50.017 --> 15:50.950
Nine more victims.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.564
All right, we know what
our killer's up to.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.399
He's searching for names
out of the phone book.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.201
MEGAN:
Apostles' names.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.469
Yeah, and obviously,
there aren't many Judases,

16:09.502 --> 16:12.105
but there are plenty of Matts,
Marks and Lukes, Pauls, Peters.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.441
We're talking tens
of thousands of possible names.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.009
Maybe not so many.

16:16.043 --> 16:19.246
This recurring repetition
of eights, three times...

16:19.279 --> 16:20.380
it's the Trinity.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.714
AMITA:
Yeah, I saw that.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.552
I assume you're assigning
some significance?

16:25.585 --> 16:28.588
Yeah, the number 888
is associated with Christ,

16:28.621 --> 16:31.258
it's arrived at by adding up
the numerical values

16:31.291 --> 16:34.527
of the Greek alphabet letters
that spell "Jesus,"

16:34.561 --> 16:36.496
and their numeric equivalents.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.631
Eight, 200,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.368
70, 400, 200.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.204
Which adds up to 888.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.438
It's called a "gematria."

16:45.472 --> 16:48.175
And people into numerology find
meaning in such digit-sums.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.776
Monkeys at typewriters.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.512
The strong law
of small numbers suggests

16:52.545 --> 16:55.215
that one will always find
meaning where one seeks it.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.084
Well, I also realized that, uh,

16:57.117 --> 17:00.587
all the victims' phone numbers
added up to 26.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.493
Yeah, Alex, I'm not sure
we see the point.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.362
Well, 26 is a gematria
for Jehovah,

17:09.396 --> 17:11.831
which is the Hebrew
name for God.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.635
Look, I'm just saying this may
be part of a gematria system...

17:15.668 --> 17:17.470
Of how the killer

17:17.504 --> 17:20.440
is choosing his victims
out of the phone book?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.175
Yeah, attaching
number values to names,

17:22.209 --> 17:23.343
street addresses, zip codes.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.678
If so, we can apply whatever
gematria system he's using

17:25.712 --> 17:28.281
to an online
phone directory.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.216
What, to data-mine
for other targets?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.352
Yeah, it's classic
enumerative combinatorics.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.321
Go ahead.
It's your idea.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.523
Okay, well,
think of it like, um...

17:36.556 --> 17:38.358
like a coin-sorting machine.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.260
Imagine dumping in
a bucketful of coins.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.695
Now we can set the machine
to sort the coins

17:42.729 --> 17:44.364
by a certain set of criteria,

17:44.397 --> 17:46.333
such as size, mass,
composition.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.268
We can do the same thing
with the algorithm

17:48.301 --> 17:49.769
to isolate a specific group
of entries

17:49.802 --> 17:52.572
which satisfies the
the killer's gematria criteria,

17:52.605 --> 17:55.542
reducing the potential target
list from tens of thousands

17:55.575 --> 17:57.144
to perhaps just
a few hundred.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.313
I'm impressed.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.081
Me, too.

18:05.352 --> 18:08.488
We tracked down the paint
the killer's been using.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.191
Only two art-restoration stores
actually carry the stuff.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.226
Clerk at one of them said
a guy came in recently

18:13.260 --> 18:14.627
and bought a large quantity.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.263
He remembers him because
of his tattoos--

18:16.296 --> 18:18.531
had a crown of thorns
and a cross inked on his neck.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.800
Not the usual look
for an art restorer.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.403
Now, an ATM across the
street got a photo.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.537
Oh, yeah? Any good?

18:24.571 --> 18:25.905
Won't win any awards,

18:25.938 --> 18:27.774
but a tech's trying
to clean it up, get us a face.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.176
All right, keep on it.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.212
CHARLIE:
Check it out.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.380
I isolated the last number

18:33.413 --> 18:35.415
of the killer's
gematria combination.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.849
Yeah, I'm running
the search algorithm right now.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.351
Great.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.187
I see you're all busy.
I'll come back.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.454
Uh, actually, Pop.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.722
I, uh...

18:42.755 --> 18:45.325
I had a few minutes,
so I did your homework.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.594
There it is.
It's all there.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.297
Uh... thanks.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.499
Hi.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.234
What have you got here?

18:54.267 --> 18:57.404
Ah, yes, numerology.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.707
You know, I read that Isaac
Newton used Bible numerology

19:00.740 --> 19:02.542
to calculate the exact date
of the apocalypse.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.478
Yeah, he came
up with 2060.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.881
You ask me, I prefer
my math and my religion

19:08.915 --> 19:10.817
on opposite sides
of the menu.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.885
LARRY: Well, then again, it was
Saint Augustine

19:12.919 --> 19:15.655
who said, that "numbers are
the universal language

19:15.688 --> 19:18.325
"given to us by the deity

19:18.358 --> 19:20.527
as confirmation
of the truth."

19:20.560 --> 19:23.563
The search algorithm just
kicked out a target list.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.532
286 names.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.535
I ran Charlie and Amita's list
against Missing Persons.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.403
I got a hit.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.439
John Lerner, 36, teacher.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.474
Good, all right, good.
-Good, and not.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.742
He's been missing
for three weeks.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.310
No body's shown up.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.745
Don, if the killer's
been holding this guy

19:38.778 --> 19:40.580
somewhere for
three weeks...

19:40.613 --> 19:41.881
John Lerner's wife, she
cancelled

19:41.914 --> 19:43.082
all of his credit cards.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.385
Somebody used one this morning
to buy pharmacy supplies.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.954
Delivered to a squatter's
tenement on skid row.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.222
All right,
good, hit that.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.258
Check in with me later.
-Okay.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.399
Somebody's been camping out.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.406
("Requiem" playing in distance)

20:19.018 --> 20:20.887
LIZ:
Take a look.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.458
(music grows louder)

20:26.893 --> 20:29.729
("Requiem" playing)

20:29.762 --> 20:30.763
Shut it off.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.938
(machine powers down,
music continues to play)

20:43.009 --> 20:44.911
It's our missing guy.
It's John Lerner.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.720
So our guy's in ICU.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.022
Third degree burns
over 80% of his body.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.557
Check this out.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.293
History says the Apostle John

21:00.327 --> 21:02.329
was boiled alive by
his persecutors,

21:02.362 --> 21:03.730
and miraculously
survived.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.565
This guy kept him alive
for three weeks

21:05.598 --> 21:06.999
just to keep cooking him.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.968
All right...

21:09.001 --> 21:11.003
So the kid who delivered
the pharmacy supplies

21:11.037 --> 21:13.306
describes a white male
with religious tattoos:

21:13.340 --> 21:15.908
cross and crown of thorns
on his neck.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.044
Forensics lifted a print
off a receipt.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.412
Jared Parr.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.414
Did time for sexual battery.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.949
COLBY: Yeah, he got fired from
his last job

21:22.982 --> 21:24.384
euthanizing animals
in a shelter.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.553
He got caught stealing drugs.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.488
Succinylcholine and aconite.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.690
Yeah, and the ATM photos
are a match.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.660
(knocking on door)

21:35.762 --> 21:37.664
Janine Parr?
-Yeah. FBI.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.098
We need to talk
to your brother.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.733
Jared's not here.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.402
Mind if we have
a look for ourselves?

21:44.937 --> 21:46.773
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.108
Hey, we've got a runner.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.042
DAVID:
Liz, take the stairs!

22:19.739 --> 22:21.107
*

22:27.880 --> 22:29.716
Jared!
Don't think about it, man!

22:29.749 --> 22:31.418
It's over, Jared.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.685
There's nowhere to go.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.760
Jared, wait!

22:40.793 --> 22:42.128
Father, forgive me.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.463
So I am commanded.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.731
LIZ:
Listen to me, okay?

22:44.764 --> 22:47.099
It's a sin to take
your own life, right?

22:47.133 --> 22:49.869
I don't want to go back
to prison.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.370
You don't want to die, either.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.547
(gunshot)

23:03.215 --> 23:04.617
Shots fired,
lock it down.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.953
Where the hell
did it come from?

23:06.986 --> 23:09.856
Not one of ours. Came from one
of the buildings over here.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.791
Check out his ink.
(distant sirens wailing)

23:11.824 --> 23:13.693
LIZ:
It's Judas.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.462
Another apostle?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.497
Yeah, except this one's
a co-conspirator.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.098
No, more like a follower.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.801
So who is he following?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.813
We searched Jared Parr's room
and found this on a flash drive.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.816
Video shows all the murders.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.852
Tortures, executions, all of it.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.722
So Jared Parr was
a willing participant.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.990
He's not
the one behind it.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.125
Time stamp on this
last part right here

23:46.158 --> 23:47.794
shows that it was
recorded yesterday.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.629
The guy in the video
is Nathaniel Greene.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.597
He's 34,

23:50.630 --> 23:52.799
an architect, went missing
about two days ago.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.967
How does the, um,

23:55.001 --> 23:56.836
the Apostle Nathaniel die?

23:56.869 --> 23:58.505
He was flayed to death
with a whip.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.574
(phone ringing)

24:01.608 --> 24:02.875
Reeves.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.679
Thank you.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.016
Our burn victim just died.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.186
Look at the men that your
brother helped to torture,

24:14.220 --> 24:15.755
Janine.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.989
He murdered them.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.559
Would you look at them?

24:19.592 --> 24:21.027
'Cause this is what your brother

24:21.060 --> 24:23.996
and the sadistic scum that
he partnered up with did.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.667
I don't believe you.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.970
Yeah, you do. Come on.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.104
It's all over your face.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.205
MEGAN: This guy used your
brother

24:33.239 --> 24:35.074
and then he killed him.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.509
And now he's got
another victim,

24:36.543 --> 24:38.210
so you've got
to start talking.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.048
Jared was a screw-up, okay?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.150
A follower.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.218
He met this guy who got
him into all this...

24:46.252 --> 24:48.087
occult stuff,
freaky clubs,

24:48.120 --> 24:49.789
the tattoos.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.925
He did whatever the guy
told him to do.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.160
Who was this guy?
You ever meet him?

24:54.193 --> 24:55.928
No.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.830
Do you know where your brother
got the tattoos?

24:57.864 --> 25:00.600
Some place in the Valley.

25:03.703 --> 25:04.904
CHARLIE:
If there's a pattern

25:04.937 --> 25:06.773
in these last four grids,
I don't see it.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.075
The repetition of zeroes
and ones, that could

25:09.108 --> 25:11.878
represent some form
of binary encoding.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.546
As far as numerological
significance goes,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.147
yeah, I've got nothing.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.515
Great, even the
fluff fails us.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.753
I'm sorry, that just came out.

25:20.787 --> 25:23.022
My skin's thick, but hey,

25:23.055 --> 25:24.323
I was a skeptic
most of my life, too.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.325
Really? What changed your mind?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.961
My last year of pre-med.

25:28.995 --> 25:32.098
My lab partner was diagnosed
with inoperable brain cancer.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.236
For four years we'd talked about
science and chemistry.

25:37.269 --> 25:40.106
But before he died, he asked me,
what did I believe?

25:40.139 --> 25:42.041
Not what did I know.

25:42.074 --> 25:46.846
You know, Stephen Jay Gould's
"non-overlapping magisteria"

25:46.879 --> 25:50.249
posits that science
and religion reside

25:50.282 --> 25:52.018
in separate and discreet realms.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.887
Well, that's
a comfortable arrangement.

25:54.921 --> 25:59.058
Nothing very comfortable
about life, though, is there?

25:59.091 --> 26:01.794
You know, I guess that I came
to the conclusion that,

26:01.828 --> 26:04.597
to understand
why we're here,

26:04.631 --> 26:06.232
it takes more than
scientific inquiry.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.036
Yeah, see--
I can't make that leap.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.237
Really?

26:11.270 --> 26:13.105
Okay, so,

26:13.139 --> 26:15.942
the most basic act
of faith is love.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.044
And I've seen enough of you
and Professor Ramanujan

26:18.077 --> 26:20.312
to suspect that
you're thoroughly leaping.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.749
Perhaps the start
of a longer journey.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.159
What do you see
in there, Charles?

26:33.192 --> 26:34.326
The zeroes and ones

26:34.360 --> 26:37.363
are degrees,
minutes and seconds.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.065
These are latitude
and longitude coordinates.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.033
(typing rapidly)

26:43.202 --> 26:44.403
Charles, that's the
Temple of the Mount.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.339
So this is Jerusalem?

26:47.373 --> 26:50.342
It's the Via Dolorosa--
uh, the "Way of the Cross."

26:50.376 --> 26:52.812
And these are all stops along
Christ's route to crucifixion.

26:52.845 --> 26:53.646
Yeah, but I don't understand

26:53.680 --> 26:55.281
what that has to do
with the killer.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.286
Graphic overlay.
-Graphic overlay.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.788
Really?
Yeah.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.255
You're sure?
-Well, just look at the maps.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.791
Here, this is
the killer's path,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.258
okay, and this is
Christ's route.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.829
Watch how they
overlay almost exactly.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.063
See that?
Yeah.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.865
Now this is the rest
of Christ's route.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.834
If our killer is trying
to create his own

27:14.867 --> 27:17.336
Via Dolorosa here
in Los Angeles,

27:17.369 --> 27:19.271
based on a similar
array of coordinates,

27:19.305 --> 27:21.407
we can then
assign probabilities

27:21.440 --> 27:24.010
to where he will
most likely hit next.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.978
Right, right. -I want you to
think of something.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.413
The killer gave us
six GPS points,

27:27.446 --> 27:30.216
there's only been
five murders.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.419
The additional
location maps

27:33.452 --> 27:37.757
to the start of
Christ's route.

27:37.790 --> 27:41.293
I think the first body
you guys found wasn't

27:41.327 --> 27:42.695
the killer's
first victim.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.697
Right, there's got
to be a Victim Zero.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.904
Jerusalem?

27:51.938 --> 27:54.173
Yeah, the killer
in Don's case

27:54.206 --> 27:57.176
seems to be confusing
his life with that of Christ.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.011
Ugh, Dad...

27:59.045 --> 28:00.246
I'm swamped.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.480
I hope that's not another
problem set.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.249
Well, actually,
it's the same one.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.351
Which I already solved.
Well, that's just it.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.787
How am I gonna learn anything
if you do all the work?

28:07.820 --> 28:10.122
Dad... -Look, I know you're
busy, Charlie...

28:10.156 --> 28:11.357
Yeah, with a murder
investigation.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.992
I just want you
to treat me

28:13.025 --> 28:14.426
like you would any
of your students.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.395
Um...

28:16.428 --> 28:18.130
um, teach me.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.266
Okay.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.068
I will. But not now.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.773
I got to get back to this.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.341
Okay.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.250
Victim Zero?

28:38.284 --> 28:39.752
Mary Velasco, 29.

28:39.786 --> 28:43.089
Found murdered in her apartment
three months ago.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.156
She was tortured.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.458
Words "Magdalene Whore"
were painted on her wall.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.459
Mary Magdalene.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.328
Some people think
she was the 13th Apostle.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.999
Initial suspect was her
boyfriend, Clay Porter.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.400
COLBY:
Former marine.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.002
Neighbors reported
violent arguments,

28:56.035 --> 28:57.436
he accused her
of cheating on him

28:57.469 --> 28:59.005
when he was deployed,
but he was released

28:59.038 --> 29:00.272
for lack of
evidence.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.273
DAVID:
Porter was part

29:01.307 --> 29:04.143
of a unit suspected of torturing
Iraqi detainees.

29:04.176 --> 29:07.179
Killing his girlfriend
could've been the trigger

29:07.213 --> 29:08.147
for revisiting
violent impulses.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.415
He was also described as
an expert marksman.

29:09.448 --> 29:12.819
So the shot that killed Jared
Parr would've been easy for him.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.322
Manager says
he's a model tenant.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.225
Quiet, pays his rent on time.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.194
Yeah, and Son of Sam's
the employee of the month.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.497
You want to ask
the manager

29:25.531 --> 29:27.466
why his model tenant
changed the locks?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.545
Clear.

29:39.578 --> 29:42.281
Yeah, here, too.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.417
COLBY: You know, not to diss his
decorating sense,

29:45.451 --> 29:48.454
but I have definitely
seen obsession done better.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.223
Yeah, we know he loves
his Bible.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.862
(indistinct radio communication)
Yep, and his crime.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.898
Long lens.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.467
He's been watching
his victims.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.938
He doesn't just like watching
his victims.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.374
He likes watching us.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.348
(tires squealing)

30:22.588 --> 30:23.956
(groaning)

30:24.623 --> 30:26.158
You okay?
Yeah.

30:26.192 --> 30:29.095
You all right?
I'm all right, man.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.398
LAPD found Porter's truck,
abandoned, no sign of him.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.100
We tracked down
the tattoo artist

30:34.133 --> 30:35.902
who did the
number grid design

30:35.935 --> 30:36.903
on Jared Parr's arm.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.205
Tomas Barrios.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.907
The tattoo parlor
is right around the corner

30:40.940 --> 30:42.608
from Mary Velasco's apartment.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.243
Also, Jared Parr's sister said

30:44.276 --> 30:46.112
that his religious tattoos
weren't his idea.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.546
Someone talked
him into it.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.215
Clay Porter?

30:49.248 --> 30:52.051
All right, let's talk
to this Tomas guy.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.953
(heavy metal rock music playing)

30:53.986 --> 30:55.487
* Turn your back on me...

30:55.521 --> 30:57.656
Tomas quit on me
a couple of days ago.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.558
Know where
we can find him?

30:59.591 --> 31:02.194
He's got a stable
of girls who put him up.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.429
Recognize this guy?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.199
Tomas did work on him, I think.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.135
All right. What about him?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.871
Can't say I do.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.043
This Tomas's work over here?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.444
Kid's a hell
of an artist.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.645
Da Vinci
with a needle, but

31:19.678 --> 31:22.614
he's a flake.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.184
You see him, you tell
him he owes me rent.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.186
I'm not running
a charity here.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.524
That door out there in the back
leads out to the alley?

31:32.558 --> 31:33.692
Yeah. Why?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.894
Just curious.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.432
(camera shutter clicking)

31:43.102 --> 31:45.537
Show me your hand.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.106
Right now!

31:47.139 --> 31:49.408
Slowly.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.377
On the wheel.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.290
DON: In your apartment, we found
your clippings

32:04.323 --> 32:06.325
and your Bible verses.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.294
We also found these.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.133
It's interesting, huh?

32:14.166 --> 32:16.402
Is it a crime
to take photographs?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.404
Depends on the subject matter.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.139
You like that
feeling, though?

32:20.172 --> 32:22.241
You like the power?
Watching people

32:22.274 --> 32:23.976
beg and plead.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.244
I know your type.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.645
Yeah, what type is that?

32:26.678 --> 32:29.315
Type of man
who doesn't like limits.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.283
Type of man
who knows

32:31.317 --> 32:33.252
exactly how far
you can push

32:33.285 --> 32:35.454
the human spirit
before the body breaks.

32:35.487 --> 32:38.424
You don't know anything.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.394
I know you.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.563
We're giving you a chance here
to avoid death row.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.232
Forensics is going
to come back

32:46.265 --> 32:48.334
from your apartment,
from your truck.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.668
Now, nobody's that careful.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.472
I didn't do anything.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.607
Except watch you guys

32:55.641 --> 32:58.144
and follow the case.

32:58.177 --> 33:01.380
For Mary, I wanted
to see justice done.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.482
DON:
So, that's all

33:03.515 --> 33:05.217
you did, you just watched us?

33:05.251 --> 33:06.685
MEGAN:
We know about Iraq.

33:06.718 --> 33:08.654
That must have
been a rush.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.656
Getting to
decide who lives

33:10.689 --> 33:13.359
and who dies
and who suffers.

33:13.392 --> 33:16.195
You are out of line.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.397
You're going to tell me
you don't see Mary's face

33:18.430 --> 33:20.066
every night begging you to stop?

33:20.099 --> 33:21.667
Are we done here?

33:21.700 --> 33:23.502
Yeah. We're done.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.137
(metal chair scraping
on floor)

33:25.171 --> 33:26.672
Let's go.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.708
DON:
What are you doing?

33:29.741 --> 33:32.244
I mean, are you trying
to blow the whole thing?

33:32.278 --> 33:34.280
You were totally
out of line in there.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.315
I've seen you go at
suspects just as hard.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.017
You want to tell me you
were out of line then?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.426
(footfalls approaching)

33:47.459 --> 33:49.828
So, uh, how's
the case going?

33:49.861 --> 33:52.331
I'm taking a break.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.433
My homework?

33:54.466 --> 33:55.667
What'd you do, make a mistake?

33:55.701 --> 33:57.569
Yeah. I was a lousy teacher.
-No, come on.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.438
Look, Charlie,
you don't have to do this...

33:59.471 --> 34:00.606
No, I do have
to do it,

34:00.639 --> 34:02.141
and believe me, I am busy,

34:02.174 --> 34:03.275
but that's why
I'm making notes for later,

34:03.309 --> 34:06.212
so that, when I have the time,
you and I can sit down

34:06.245 --> 34:07.813
and go through it all.

34:07.846 --> 34:10.082
Thanks.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.619
We didn't get many chances.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.389
Hmm?

34:17.423 --> 34:20.459
The whole parent helping
the kid out

34:20.492 --> 34:22.194
with his homework thing.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.263
I don't know.

34:24.296 --> 34:27.299
I remember, uh,
making some dioramas.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.367
(laughs softly)

34:28.400 --> 34:30.169
Yeah.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.338
I'm not sure Einstein's father
was much help to him, either.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.305
Well, I just
see it now

34:33.339 --> 34:37.243
as a teacher,
that satisfaction comes not

34:37.276 --> 34:38.344
from having all the answers,

34:38.377 --> 34:41.247
but from watching others
find them.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.882
And you missed out on that.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.253
And this is why you're
helping me with my homework?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.420
Yeah.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.822
Don't expect any dioramas.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.362
You know, Smart Charlie,
I've spent 30 years

34:56.395 --> 34:58.197
learning to live with.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.332
Wise Charlie could take
some getting used to.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.237
(chuckles)

35:05.271 --> 35:07.706
DAVID: Who do we have, guy from
the flash drive?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.875
Nope. Tomas Barrios,
our tattoo artist.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.510
Ran his list
of girlfriends.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.678
He'd been staying here.

35:12.711 --> 35:13.912
This girl's a model.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.481
She's been in
Europe since July.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.815
How'd he die?

35:16.848 --> 35:18.717
Multiple stab
wounds, large blade.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.287
Martyred like the
Apostle Thomas.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.455
No bible verse, no
tattoo this time,

35:23.489 --> 35:24.856
but take a look at this.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.525
(grunts)

35:26.558 --> 35:29.528
This guy's been dead
a couple of months.

35:29.561 --> 35:30.662
Now, the tattoo parlor
owner said

35:30.696 --> 35:32.431
he quit a couple
of days ago, right?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.533
Yeah.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.468
He lied.

35:36.502 --> 35:37.903
(glass breaking)

35:40.806 --> 35:42.808
To the right!

35:43.909 --> 35:45.477
MAN:
It's clear!

35:45.511 --> 35:47.479
No, he's gone.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.348
(panting)

35:50.749 --> 35:52.518
And we got a door.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.304
DAVID:
Da Vinci with a needle.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.340
Yeah, he was talking
about himself.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.846
(sobbing)

36:20.879 --> 36:22.914
("Requiem" playing)

36:22.948 --> 36:26.518
Why are you doing this?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.954
You were chosen.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.823
Please...
-We were talking to this guy.

36:31.857 --> 36:35.527
We had him.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.563
(crying)

36:42.734 --> 36:44.436
All-nighter?

36:46.272 --> 36:48.507
I just keep looking for
something that we missed.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.410
Our guy grabbed Nathaniel Greene
48 hours ago

36:51.443 --> 36:52.678
and no body's turned up yet,

36:52.711 --> 36:55.447
so, it's a good
thing, I guess.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.522
I just can't believe
I was so wrong.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.257
Not to pile on,

37:05.291 --> 37:07.759
but a friend of mine pulled
his Pentagon file.

37:07.793 --> 37:11.597
An inquiry found Clay Porter
innocent of charges in Iraq.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.533
Actually, it turns out he was
the guy who blew the whistle.

37:14.566 --> 37:18.637
When I was on assignment
for the DOJ...

37:18.670 --> 37:20.639
you know what I was doing?

37:22.674 --> 37:24.543
I can guess.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.413
CIA recruited shrinks,
behaviorists,

37:27.446 --> 37:29.581
to advise on interrogation
of detainees at GITMO

37:29.615 --> 37:30.649
and other places.

37:32.751 --> 37:36.555
I thought I knew what I was
getting myself into.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.028
I asked Don
if I could come back.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.063
You know, you can lose
your faith around here.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.197
It's pretty easy.

37:46.231 --> 37:49.401
But, uh, I figure the only way
things might get better

37:49.435 --> 37:51.470
is if people like you and I
don't run away.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.975
Hang in there, Megan.

37:57.008 --> 38:00.546
Using the overlay maps, I was
able to generate a hot zone

38:00.579 --> 38:02.648
following Via Dolorosa.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.383
Uh-huh, so what's
the problem?

38:04.416 --> 38:06.585
This-- the latest victim.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.654
Well, well off the chosen path.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.956
He's following
his own Way of the Cross.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.691
To resurrection.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.860
It's the number 153 again.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.563
So, in the Bible, Christ
appears to the disciples

38:17.596 --> 38:18.430
after the resurrection.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.831
He tells them to cast out
their nets

38:19.865 --> 38:22.601
and they catch
153 fish.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.035
And it happened
on the Sea of Tiberias.

38:24.069 --> 38:28.106
Which roughly corresponds to our
latest crime scene. -Yeah.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.575
CHARLIE:
After Christ's resurrection,

38:29.608 --> 38:30.709
what happens next?

38:30.742 --> 38:31.910
ALEX:
It's the Ascension.

38:31.943 --> 38:35.347
Christ ascends into Heaven,
is seated at the right hand.

38:35.381 --> 38:39.551
So, what,
we look to the heavens?

38:39.585 --> 38:40.819
Well, he prefers
abandoned buildings.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.588
Perhaps an office tower?

38:42.621 --> 38:44.556
(typing, computer trilling)

38:44.590 --> 38:46.425
CHARLIE:
Or a church.

38:46.458 --> 38:49.728
You said that the number 888

38:49.761 --> 38:52.698
was associated with Christ.
Mm-hmm.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.900
Yeah, Nathaniel Greene
was our eigth victim.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.635
And eight blocks from
the last crime scene

38:56.668 --> 39:00.071
is the Church of Christ--
it's the Ascension.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.541
If that part of town
is a grid...

39:02.574 --> 39:03.542
X-Y coordinates.

39:03.575 --> 39:04.543
Eighth victim,

39:04.576 --> 39:06.778
8-by-8 square block area.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.647
That completes the Trinity.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.650
Then we should be
looking here...

39:11.683 --> 39:13.619
for an abandoned building.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.861
("Requiem" playing)

39:40.078 --> 39:41.980
All right, John,
take it easy, take it easy.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.849
Take it easy now.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.150
You don't want
to do this, John.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.786
No, no, no, no, no--
you have to leave.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.755
I'm not finished.
It's in the name of God.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.122
DON: We're going to work this
out, okay?

39:51.156 --> 39:54.460
He's your apostle, John.
You don't want to hurt him.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.326
You need to be quiet,
blasphemer.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.862
DON: John, listen, what do you
want?

39:56.895 --> 39:58.497
You want to walk out of here,

39:58.530 --> 40:00.832
you want a car,
you want a plane? Just tell me.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.801
You have nothing that I want.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.438
(gunshot)

40:06.472 --> 40:08.740
What are you doing?!

40:08.774 --> 40:10.676
Roll on your back.

40:10.709 --> 40:14.813
("Requiem" swells in volume)

40:14.846 --> 40:16.782
*

40:22.788 --> 40:23.955
(music fades)

40:23.989 --> 40:25.824
They had to die.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.627
They had to give their lives
to me, like my Judas.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.896
He didn't give you his
life, John, you took it.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.631
What are you
talking about?

40:32.664 --> 40:34.600
I didn't shoot Jared,
you did.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.001
Why are you lying to me?

40:36.034 --> 40:37.503
(gunshot)

40:37.536 --> 40:38.570
Sniper! Sniper!

40:38.604 --> 40:39.905
Side two! Side two!

40:50.916 --> 40:53.752
COLBY: Well... looks like Porter
got his justice.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.722
Yeah, he shot
Jared Parr.

40:56.755 --> 40:57.889
And now Corcoran.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.691
He used us to
find them both.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.666
We checked out
Clay Porter's apartment.

41:07.699 --> 41:08.900
Yeah, the guy's cleared out.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.936
He's probably
in Mexico, right?

41:13.138 --> 41:14.840
Hey, Don.
Hey.

41:14.873 --> 41:17.008
Um, about yesterday...

41:17.042 --> 41:18.977
Hey, don't sweat it.
I mean, I understand.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.946
Seriously.
Actually, come here.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.951
Guys.

41:25.984 --> 41:26.852
Look, uh...

41:26.885 --> 41:30.221
you know, we've
all be through a lot.

41:30.255 --> 41:33.024
Had each other's backs
too long to start

41:33.058 --> 41:34.860
changing things
around now.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.828
And Colby here has
asked to stick around.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.830
I don't really want
to let him go,

41:38.864 --> 41:41.299
so... welcome back, brother.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.536
302s on my desk
by 8:00, all right?

41:47.573 --> 41:50.141
(elevator bell dings)

41:50.175 --> 41:52.110
...is actually
mathematically perfect.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.679
Have you been
there before?

41:53.712 --> 41:55.013
Well, no, but I'd like
to take you there one day.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.848
Be very sweet.
-That is sweet.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.618
Hey, there they are.
-Hey. You guys ready?

41:59.651 --> 42:02.654
Yeah. Let's hope we can actually
make it to dessert this time.

42:02.688 --> 42:06.057
Well, guess what,
dinner's on me.

42:06.091 --> 42:09.027
Because I got my first check
from my publisher.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.962
How about we get to pick
the restaurant then?

42:10.996 --> 42:12.063
Check's not that big.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.999
Actually, I was thinking
that we could do something

42:14.032 --> 42:15.934
more casual, like a
barbeque at the house.

42:15.967 --> 42:16.735
Yeah, yeah, that's sounds good.

42:16.768 --> 42:17.736
Kick back
and have a few beers.

42:17.769 --> 42:20.005
Yeah, all right.
I think that does sound good.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.940
Maybe I'll show you the garage
or something like that.

42:21.973 --> 42:23.942
CHARLIE:
Uh, what?

42:23.975 --> 42:25.243
Actually, sorry,
it's my turn for the garage.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.778
No, no, no, no, no.

42:26.812 --> 42:28.046
All right, well,
how about we flip?

42:28.079 --> 42:29.247
No, it's my turn.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.949
I've been waiting 15
years for that garage.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.250
No way, dude.
We're not going to flip.

42:32.283 --> 42:34.019
Call it.
-That's one of those magic coins

42:34.052 --> 42:36.622
that you used to use when
we were kids-- tails.
