00:00.001 --> 00:04.737
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
Her majesty marie de guise.

00:04.739 --> 00:05.704
Mother.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.239
Marie:
<i>You need France.</i>

00:07.241 --> 00:09.308
Marry its next king
and the protestants

00:09.310 --> 00:11.210
Will scurry into
the darkness.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.312
I saw a woman,
dressed all in white.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.280
She brought me
back to life.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.582
Whatever your grudge
is against bash...

00:16.584 --> 00:18.450
He maimed our brother
and caused his death!

00:18.452 --> 00:20.386
You won't settle it
by ruining his marriage.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.054
Did you poison my father?

00:22.056 --> 00:23.288
It wasn't them.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.490
It was the duke of guise.

00:24.492 --> 00:25.624
Your uncle

00:25.626 --> 00:27.326
Will never betray anyone again.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.731
And so we mourn my brother.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.734
A man who always put
his country first.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.103
Whenever it was
profitable.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.705
And who always
understood his duty.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.373
To himself.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.508
And now, bishop marcombe

00:42.510 --> 00:44.710
Will say a special prayer.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.179
Marcombe:
My lords and ladies, please

00:47.181 --> 00:49.348
Bow your heads in prayer

00:49.350 --> 00:50.516
For our brother who has left...

00:50.518 --> 00:52.718
What beautiful sentiments.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.119
Don't bother.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.487
I know you're as glad to see

00:55.489 --> 00:56.688
The back of him as any of us.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.425
Thank you, by the way,

00:59.427 --> 01:00.793
For keeping his
treachery a secret.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.567
I know that look.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.469
You think I look at
every woman with an aim

01:10.471 --> 01:11.570
Toward getting them in bed.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.639
Oh, it's not the pining look

01:13.641 --> 01:15.274
You get before you
begin an assault.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.276
It's the possessive
look of a man

01:17.278 --> 01:19.478
Who's already
achieved something.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.213
If you're under the
delusion that I've slept...

01:21.215 --> 01:22.281
Ah!

01:22.283 --> 01:23.849
I have my answer.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.352
No sex, but you've
begun turning her heart.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.654
Even better.

01:28.656 --> 01:29.755
And to think
I was giving a party

01:29.757 --> 01:33.292
To improve
valois/bourbon relations.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.794
You're already doing that.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.763
While no man is without sin,
we ask that...

01:37.765 --> 01:39.264
Francis thought
you might object

01:39.266 --> 01:41.366
To our filling
your brother full of arrows.

01:41.368 --> 01:44.336
You knew better, I trust.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.838
It's the one thing all
rulers have in common.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.406
We must stamp out whoever

01:47.408 --> 01:49.341
Would undermine the monarchy.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.709
Nothing can be
allowed to discredit

01:50.711 --> 01:53.645
The lawful cycle of
rule and succession.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.581
Which reminds me.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.782
Daughter?

01:58.551 --> 02:00.385
We need to have a talk.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.863
I was looking for you at
the duke's memorial service.

02:10.865 --> 02:12.564
I have news.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.433
The duke and duchess

02:14.435 --> 02:16.401
Von amsberg are in town nearby.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.337
They're of a wealthy, powerful
branch of the hapsburgs.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.572
Well, I've heard
of them, of course.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.241
They have agreed
to an engagement

02:22.243 --> 02:24.510
Between their infant daughter
and our son.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.612
"an engagement"?

02:26.614 --> 02:28.347
I know that you've been worried
about what john's fate would be

02:28.349 --> 02:29.681
If anything happened to me.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.416
Oh, a safe haven for our child.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.618
More than that.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.652
The hapsburgs are
one of the most

02:33.654 --> 02:35.254
Powerful families in europe.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.322
An excellent
alliance for France.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.790
And john's future is assured.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.193
That's wonderful, francis.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.162
There's one catch.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.264
The duke and duchess
want to meet you.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.799
You mean they want
to pass judgment on me.

02:49.202 --> 02:50.636
What if I don't measure up?

02:50.638 --> 02:52.204
Oh, it's just a formality.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.705
Tomorrow night king
antoine is holding

02:53.707 --> 02:54.773
A gathering to celebrate

02:54.775 --> 02:56.675
Between France and navarre.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.944
I suggested we all meet there.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.612
Just be yourself.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.614
You would impress anyone.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.619
Lady kenna?

03:07.621 --> 03:09.621
Already the room looks brighter.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.822
I can't stay.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.591
I just came to return this.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.226
What's this?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.528
The ruby I found in the
strawberry you left me.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.197
You have something
against gifts?

03:18.199 --> 03:19.798
It's not a gift.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.899
It's an invitation.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.601
One that I can't accept.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.702
I've told you.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.304
I love my husband.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.605
And this flirtation
of yours must stop.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.373
Lovely kenna?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.475
I will respect your wishes,
and stop laying my heart

03:30.477 --> 03:32.311
So inconveniently at your feet.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.479
I mean it.
So do I.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.783
By the way, how do you
like my preparations

03:37.785 --> 03:38.850
For tomorrow night's event?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.719
It's beautiful.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.588
Oh, now you're just being kind.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.323
Usually my wife jeanne would
organize this type of thing.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.791
She's brilliant
at official affairs.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.460
But she's ill
and had to stay in navarre.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.796
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:50.798 --> 03:53.732
Oh, you know the valois court
and those who serve there.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.401
Perhaps you might help me.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.769
Well, I don't think...

03:57.771 --> 03:59.504
Well, I know
exactly what I want.

03:59.506 --> 04:02.241
I want light fixtures hung
with strands of jewels,

04:02.243 --> 04:05.844
Painted tiles in the
foyer bearing the valois

04:05.846 --> 04:08.814
And bourbon crests,
intertwined in friendship.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.816
Well... I do know

04:10.818 --> 04:13.685
A custom tile maker.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.821
I just don't think
my husband is going

04:15.823 --> 04:17.589
To approve of me helping you.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.025
I don't think he's
gonna come to your party.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.729
Well, the whole point of the
event is to bury the past.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.697
To bring our two families
back together.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.267
To ensure peace between
the two royal households.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.801
You won't help me?

04:29.803 --> 04:32.504
Well, I'm such a fool
when it comes to money.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.506
I have no idea
how much to give you.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.842
Well, I didn't say
that I would.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.744
Will 300,000
gold deniers be enough?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.812
You want to give me
300,000 gold deniers?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.614
To go shopping?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.316
Please?

04:46.886 --> 04:47.986
Where is your heir?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.621
I had a feeling.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.523
It's a bit complicated.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.859
By the fact that francis no
longer visits your chambers?

04:53.861 --> 04:55.394
Is that your decision or his?

04:55.396 --> 04:56.728
It's ours.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.063
Or has lola come
between you two?

04:58.065 --> 05:01.433
No, mother,
please don't find fault.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.669
Things have merely
changed between us.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.703
Mary?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.371
You are here to do a job.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.311
I know how it can be.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.981
A continual chore
one comes to dread.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.717
This will help.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.319
What on earth is...?

05:20.321 --> 05:21.787
A herbal concoction.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.988
Mixed by my physician.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.023
Small miracle, really.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.959
Only use a pinch
in your wine before,

05:27.961 --> 05:29.828
And you will be...

05:29.830 --> 05:31.663
At ease.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.832
In an expansive mood.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.100
Darling?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.702
You are never going
to get pregnant again

05:36.704 --> 05:37.969
If you don't try.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.838
And you really need to.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.873
Quickly.
Why?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.775
Your cousin elizabeth
remains unmarried.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.577
People are worried

05:45.579 --> 05:48.413
About the instability
that would follow if she dies.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.116
Her subjects want an heir

05:51.118 --> 05:53.819
From their royal bloodline.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.654
That you can provide.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.489
I'm not sure if I can.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.358
Things have changed
in scotland as well.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.060
Your brother james
is under pressure.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.429
The protestant lords
want you gone.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.864
They want to make scotland

06:05.866 --> 06:07.766
A protectorate of England.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.602
But he insists that you
are the lawful queen.

06:10.604 --> 06:13.605
A stand that protects
his hold on power as well.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.773
You are on the cusp

06:14.775 --> 06:17.442
Of losing your country.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.746
Either you
or elizabeth will rule

06:20.748 --> 06:22.748
Scotland and England.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.883
Make an heir,

06:24.885 --> 06:26.952
And it will be you.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.396
Why didn't you tell your mother
what happened to you?

06:37.398 --> 06:39.831
Every time I talk
about it, I relive it.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.900
I simply didn't want to.
Not with her.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.968
She'll be leaving soon,
at least.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.136
Yes.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.904
She is right.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.739
What?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.842
That we need to conceive
a child without delay?

06:51.944 --> 06:53.745
Mary, it's too soon.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.414
You have heirs

06:55.416 --> 06:56.481
To take your crown
when you're gone.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.749
Your brothers.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.784
I have no one.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.951
And with elizabeth

06:59.953 --> 07:01.086
Becoming more aggressive,

07:01.088 --> 07:02.554
I need to amass support.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.822
I can't believe that you would

07:03.824 --> 07:05.056
Base your choice solely

07:05.058 --> 07:07.192
On international policy.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.995
Once you spoke to me
about the need for love.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.831
And what would
this encounter be?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.066
Are you saying that you're
open to us beginning again?

07:15.068 --> 07:18.737
I'm speaking of our duty.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.173
To our nations,
to each other.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.909
I am asking you to
help me protect myself.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.010
My rule.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.912
I need to think about it.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.780
And I believe
you need to as well.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.519
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to go to a social event

07:34.521 --> 07:35.987
Hosted by a man who knows
I killed his brother.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.956
As I understand it,

07:37.958 --> 07:40.058
Antoine just likes
any excuse to throw a party.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.561
I doubt he'll even notice
if you or I aren't there.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.095
He might notice
if I'm not there.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.031
Seeing as... I'm the one

07:46.033 --> 07:48.033
Helping him give the party.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.067
You're what?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.902
He was having difficulties.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.472
And I thought it would be
good diplomacy.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.040
You know what he wants from you.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.975
It's not hospitality advice.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.944
Bash, I know what a man
like antoine wants.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.645
I'm not a fool.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.481
But I can handle him.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.817
This has given me a chance
to go out and see people.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.819
To do something with my
day besides sit around

08:07.821 --> 08:08.954
And wait for you.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.856
Please, won't you

08:10.858 --> 08:13.625
Just consider attending
the party with me?

08:13.627 --> 08:15.961
Then you can see for yourself
what I've been doing.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.028
I was just about to leave.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.030
(groans)
there's a woman

08:19.032 --> 08:20.131
In the village inspiring fear.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.000
They say that she can
raise the dead.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.969
I need to get out there
and find her

08:23.971 --> 08:25.136
Before this escalates
into a witch hunt.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.539
Here we are again.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.808
You have to run off
and save the world.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.077
How many more battles for you

08:32.079 --> 08:34.079
And lonely nights for me
until it's all done?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.113
Kenna...

08:36.649 --> 08:38.049
I might not be back until late.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.051
(groans)
if you can wait for me here,

08:40.053 --> 08:41.520
We will go
to the party together.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.888
And you can show me

08:42.890 --> 08:46.057
Your handiwork.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.993
So, marie de guise wants you

08:47.995 --> 08:50.962
To get back to the business
of making heirs.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.565
Mary's willing.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.066
Is she, now?

08:56.302 --> 08:58.236
I don't know that she's ready.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.673
She already links me
with the attack.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.075
The man who did it
blamed me outright

09:04.077 --> 09:05.810
Before he...

09:05.812 --> 09:07.746
How do you forget that?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.080
Why now, I wonder?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.949
Have you considered
the possibility

09:10.951 --> 09:12.684
That mary welcomes this push?

09:12.686 --> 09:14.753
It has been months.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.288
You should take
that into account.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.223
A word of advice.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.324
This is her choice.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.760
Follow her lead.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.095
But for the stability
of the realm, a king's visit

09:24.097 --> 09:27.065
To a queen's chambers
must be witnessed.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.100
People know that you've
been living apart.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.936
If mary should find
herself with child,

09:30.938 --> 09:33.138
There must be
no talk from anyone

09:33.140 --> 09:35.240
About whose child this is.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.842
Of course.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.012
Hello.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.814
I'm hoping you can help me.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.150
I'm the king's deputy.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.719
I understand you had
a visit from a healer.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.254
A woman dressed all in white?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.022
"a healer"?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.024
Yeah, well, that's what
she called herself.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.160
My little paul there
had a terrible fever.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.629
Physician said he was dying,
nothing to be done.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.031
I even went to the convent
to ask the nuns to pray for him.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.968
But he just got weaker.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.302
Then this woman came,
said she could help.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.804
And did she?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.639
I can see your son's
still alive.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.808
Oh, yeah. Yeah, she placed
her hands on him.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.710
In two days time, he was running
around, same as ever.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.078
And yet you don't seem thankful.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.147
Paul, mark!
Both of you, come here.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.150
There's always a price,
ain't there?

10:19.152 --> 10:22.187
When we take help
from devils and witches.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.223
I should've known.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.027
He was fine and whole,
till she came.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.196
She blinded my boy.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.165
You find her...
And put a stop to her.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.678
Greer:
Sharlene?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.146
(scoffs)

10:48.148 --> 10:50.415
If you've come to say good-bye,
don't bother.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.717
It's your fault
I couldn't pay my rent.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.152
Your man, that dirty bird

10:54.154 --> 10:56.855
Who chopped my gorgeous hair,
cost me my living.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.757
I know, and-and I'm sorry.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.759
That's why I got
you this wig.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.227
You're serious?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.928
Do you know
how much that's worth?

11:03.930 --> 11:06.297
It's yours. Take it, please.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.670
I'm not sure
it's gonna change much.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.172
I'm not tainted with leper bits,

11:14.174 --> 11:15.874
Like they said,
but I might as well be.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.009
Folks on the street
won't come near me.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.980
Sharlene, there are
other clients

11:21.982 --> 11:23.181
You might make yourself
available to.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.450
Oh, I'm available.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.318
Because I'm a whore, you see,
that's the point.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.888
I meant other venues,

11:29.890 --> 11:31.756
Where one
might meet you.

11:33.325 --> 11:35.326
There's a party I know about,
here in town.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.896
There'll be lots
of rich, drunk men

11:37.898 --> 11:39.130
Mingling about.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.900
Outside, having a smoke

11:41.902 --> 11:44.102
Where you might
say hello.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.704
Oh, you'll need
a different frock, though,

11:45.706 --> 11:46.971
If you're going to blend in.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.174
Come with me.
Oh...

11:59.985 --> 12:01.119
Lola.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.725
Your highness.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.260
I didn't see you
at my brother's funeral.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.229
Were you avoiding me?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.831
Coddling your bastard child?

12:12.833 --> 12:16.101
I deserve your anger, and more,

12:16.103 --> 12:19.304
But I'm afraid just now
there's somewhere I have to be.

12:19.306 --> 12:23.308
Yes. I heard you were
meeting the von amsbergs.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.176
To try to overcome
the perception

12:25.178 --> 12:27.412
That you are just one
of the king's mistresses.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.314
Francis is faithful to mary.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.849
And as for me,

12:30.851 --> 12:32.250
It was when they were apart,

12:32.252 --> 12:33.284
And it was one night.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.086
"one night."

12:35.088 --> 12:38.456
Don't flaunt your
bountiful womb to me.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.825
They may
have been apart,

12:40.827 --> 12:44.763
But you were and
always have been mary's lady,

12:44.765 --> 12:46.297
Since you were
a child.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.433
There were dozens
of little girls

12:48.435 --> 12:51.269
Whose families begged me
for that position.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.871
But I chose you.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.939
Because you played
well together,

12:54.941 --> 12:56.341
Because you didn't hurt
or throw mud at her,

12:56.343 --> 12:57.408
But now you have done both,

12:57.410 --> 12:58.877
As, clearly,

12:58.879 --> 13:00.445
Francis can procreate
with anyone,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.113
They say.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.182
The gossip of his tryst
finds fault with mary.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.184
I know, and I think
it's terrible...

13:06.186 --> 13:08.553
Oh, I know you do.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.356
So warm and frank
in your approach to things.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.791
To mary.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.526
Makes her feel
like a regular girl.

13:14.528 --> 13:17.829
But she is not a regular girl.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.399
Mary is a queen

13:21.401 --> 13:24.235
Who must be seen
as a force of nature.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.070
Anything less endangers her.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.240
And you and your son
make her seem...

13:29.242 --> 13:30.575
Deficient.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.143
Useless.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.411
Disposable.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.214
You know what happens
to disposable queens?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.249
They are disposed of.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.451
Brutally.

13:42.388 --> 13:43.421
If it happens,

13:43.423 --> 13:45.824
Remember your role
in her demise.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.292
I know I will.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.006
(bell ringing)

14:02.008 --> 14:04.876
The sisters know
that I'm a healer.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.512
They believe I am blessed,
and took me in.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.414
How did you find me?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.049
They call you
the woman in white.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.383
I found you
here because

14:12.385 --> 14:13.852
The woman you helped

14:13.854 --> 14:15.353
Mentioned she came
to the convent

14:15.355 --> 14:17.355
And asked the nuns
to pray for her child.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.890
But you do more than pray,
don't you,

14:18.892 --> 14:20.425
Sister delphine?

14:20.427 --> 14:21.626
How did you heal
that woman's son?

14:21.628 --> 14:23.328
I laid hands on him.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.163
And the man risen
from the grave?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.365
The greek worker
who had taken ill?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.867
You mean the man
they buried alive.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.368
I didn't
do anything

14:30.370 --> 14:31.569
But hear his cries.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.371
I don't hurt people.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.373
That's never
my intention.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.276
I'm sorry to hear
that boy's brother went blind.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.112
But there's no certainty
that it was some kind of price.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.947
But this has
happened before.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.216
You save someone at
a cost to another.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.051
Not always.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.454
Many times there are
no consequences.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.356
Even so, I only cure people

14:51.358 --> 14:53.191
I know will die without my help.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.525
So if there
is a price,

14:54.527 --> 14:57.195
Surely it's less
than losing someone you love.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.364
But how do you know
someone is truly dying?

14:59.366 --> 15:00.398
Can you see
the future?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.499
I've known
other visionaries.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.134
I'm not asking to taunt you.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.103
When I touch someone,

15:05.105 --> 15:07.171
I know their pain.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.307
Pain they've experienced

15:09.309 --> 15:13.044
And, yes,
sometimes pain yet to come.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.446
Prove it.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.981
Lay hands on me.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.950
What do you see?

15:25.124 --> 15:26.624
You've been wounded in battle.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.060
That's an easy guess
for a man of my age and station.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.030
I see you on a horse...

15:32.032 --> 15:35.066
Bleeding out,
hands reaching for you.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.501
Did you nearly die
for a brother?

15:36.503 --> 15:37.969
A woman?

15:37.971 --> 15:39.070
Both.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.705
Your heart...

15:40.707 --> 15:43.675
Broken, and then healed...

15:43.677 --> 15:45.643
But it will shatter because...

15:45.645 --> 15:47.078
Go on.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.414
You will lose someone
very close to you.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.050
And soon.
Who?

15:53.385 --> 15:54.619
Tell me who.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.387
I don't know.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.659
(lyrical music playing)

16:01.661 --> 16:05.096
This is terrible!

16:05.098 --> 16:07.165
Your guests have arrived
and I lost track of the time.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.733
Well, everything looks perfect.
What are you worried about?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.568
The party's started.
I'm not even dressed for it.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.237
I'm yet to go back to
the castle to meet my husband.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.006
We're supposed to be
attending together.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.141
Well, you're here now.
Why don't we send a message

16:17.143 --> 16:19.377
For him to join you?
I don't think that would be
such a good idea.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.312
Do you need these,
lady kenna?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.014
But... No, they're all jumbled

16:23.016 --> 16:24.382
And they're supposed
to go on the tables.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.717
Well, people will find
their own seats.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.418
That's how it
works, isn't it?

16:27.420 --> 16:30.421
Lady lola is supposed to be sat
next to the von amsbergs.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.457
I look a mess.
What am I going to do?

16:32.459 --> 16:33.658
Take these upstairs,
sort them out.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.493
I'll have a dress
sent up to you

16:35.495 --> 16:37.562
And a message sent to
sebastian to meet you here.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.263
You have dresses at the ready?

16:39.265 --> 16:40.498
Designers send
collections to my homes

16:40.500 --> 16:42.400
In the hope that my
wife will choose one.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.469
I can't wear a dress
meant for your wife.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.537
That feels wrong.
Kenna, it's
only clothing.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.373
I'm sure you'll find
something that suits you.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.440
And send her up some jewels.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.675
Uh, what do you favor?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.543
Emeralds? Sapphires?

16:55.547 --> 16:57.482
Lady kenna will be
writing a message

16:57.484 --> 16:58.683
To her husband at court.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.119
Make sure she sees
a rider dispatched,

17:01.121 --> 17:03.321
But the message
should never get there.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.693
Lola.
How nice to see you.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.396
Oh, louis!

17:11.398 --> 17:13.731
My son might get engaged
before he can walk.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.500
Isn't that wonderful?
(laughs)

17:15.502 --> 17:17.201
I... I suppose.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.605
Be happy for me, won't you?

17:20.607 --> 17:23.541
Lola, I have to ask...

17:23.543 --> 17:25.376
Are you all right?

17:25.378 --> 17:28.446
Oh, very relaxed.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.482
And usually these
kinds of things make me nervous.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.551
But I had a little drink

17:33.553 --> 17:36.554
Before I came,
to steady my nerves.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.490
Marie de guise does not like me.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.493
You were drinking
with marie de guise?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.595
What were you
drinking, exactly?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.531
Well, I thought it was wine,

17:46.533 --> 17:49.434
But it was bitter

17:49.436 --> 17:51.135
And heavy with resin.

17:51.137 --> 17:54.238
But I gulped it down anyway,
because...

17:54.240 --> 17:56.574
Well, have you met
mary's mother?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.443
She's terrifying.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.477
(gasps)

17:59.479 --> 18:01.179
Marzipan!

18:01.181 --> 18:02.713
Oh...

18:14.393 --> 18:15.593
(door creaks open)

18:26.572 --> 18:27.805
Hi.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.510
I'm all right.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.178
I want to do this.

18:41.353 --> 18:42.687
I-I'm just cold.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.822
Here.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.766
Are you sure
about this?

19:23.562 --> 19:25.596
I'm sorry,
it's your breathing.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.733
As long as
I look at you...

19:45.951 --> 19:47.685
We can't do this.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.720
You shouldn't
do this.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.689
We have to, francis.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.424
Why now, mary?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.526
You talk of an heir,

19:55.528 --> 19:58.229
And yes, a son

19:58.231 --> 19:59.797
Would help both of us

19:59.799 --> 20:02.533
And make you a better
choice than elizabeth,

20:02.535 --> 20:04.735
But what are the odds

20:04.737 --> 20:06.671
That we would
conceive a child--

20:06.673 --> 20:09.307
A son-- this night?

20:11.376 --> 20:12.777
We'll try next month.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.844
I don't want to wait.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.681
Just until
you're ready.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.250
I know that England and
scotland are in chaos,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.285
But is this
really the answer?

20:21.287 --> 20:24.522
Is elizabeth really
so frightening?

20:24.524 --> 20:26.557
Can you trust that
I will defend you?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.792
Defend scotland.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.694
Defend my people.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.996
Are you afraid that
I won't protect you?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.665
Well, what if you turn on me?

20:34.667 --> 20:37.768
What if I do something
to anger you, in the months

20:37.770 --> 20:39.770
And years to come?
I would never hurt you.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.905
You don't know that.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.775
If we live separate lives,

20:44.777 --> 20:46.444
Move on with others...

20:46.446 --> 20:48.646
I don't want to move on
with others, with anyone.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.518
But... But you do?

20:56.455 --> 20:58.456
CondÃ©.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.627
Have things progressed
between you?

21:02.629 --> 21:04.695
We have done nothing.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.963
But he loves you.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.999
You and I both
know that.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.669
Do you love him?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.671
Is that what all
this is about?

21:13.673 --> 21:15.806
Did you come to me because
you're afraid you'll go to him?

21:15.808 --> 21:18.009
Or because you want
to secure your rule

21:18.011 --> 21:20.711
In scotland
before you do?

21:20.713 --> 21:22.046
Mary!
Both.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.948
Is that what you
wanted to hear?

21:23.950 --> 21:26.951
I don't know if I can
love anyone again,

21:26.953 --> 21:29.553
But I know I can't
keep living like this.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.988
A queen but not a queen.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.423
A wife but not a wife.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.758
Then be my wife.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.959
I can't.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.994
We've been over this already.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.496
Too much has passed between us.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.499
Too much you blame me for.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.434
While condÃ© remains
untarnished.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.670
And now you want
to go to him,

21:45.672 --> 21:47.838
Thinking it will erase
your pain.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.873
It won't, mary.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.575
I won't let you do it.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.444
No.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.578
I forbid it.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.826
â™ª the green truck hummed low

22:08.828 --> 22:11.729
â™ª ah, we took only back roads

22:11.731 --> 22:14.799
â™ª we drove miles of country...

22:14.801 --> 22:19.603
Who knew vengeance could
be quite so invigorating?

22:19.605 --> 22:21.605
â™ª sing me, baby, home

22:21.607 --> 22:22.773
â™ª sing me, baby...

22:22.775 --> 22:23.774
Is bash here?

22:23.776 --> 22:24.775
Not yet.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.477
Come.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.947
Let me introduce you
to some very influential people.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.751
Bash:
<i>Where the hell is she?</i>

22:33.753 --> 22:35.553
Is there no sign of lady kenna?

22:35.555 --> 22:36.787
No word?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.622
Nothing, my lord.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.624
I checked with the guards
in the watchtower.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.693
Not even a carriage
on the horizon.

22:57.876 --> 22:58.876
This is your daughter.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.111
Yes.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.912
She took our breath away, too.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.881
She has your nose.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.383
(chuckles)

23:05.385 --> 23:07.818
And your... Eyebrow.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.488
Are those ears?

23:10.490 --> 23:11.922
Why are they so far back?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.091
Ah, lola, I see you've met
the von amsbergs.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.460
And their baby.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.729
Johnnie would have to
be a saint to marry it.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.867
Excuse us
for a moment.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.669
How drunk are you?

23:25.671 --> 23:27.104
Have you ever noticed

23:27.106 --> 23:31.108
How many shimmering soft things
there are in the world?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.810
(chuckles)

23:34.112 --> 23:36.113
Like little
gold ribbons.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.515
(chuckles wearily)

23:37.517 --> 23:38.949
Please stop doing that.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.786
Oh, it's nice
that you're here.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.621
That you were willing
to marry our son

23:43.623 --> 23:47.625
To that ugly baby
because you are a good person.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.826
I'm not a good person.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.828
I wasn't tonight, at least.

23:50.830 --> 23:54.064
But you are.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.066
Let's get you out of here.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.168
Mmm.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.673
What's wrong?

24:02.675 --> 24:04.842
I asked you here
to tell you something.

24:05.777 --> 24:06.911
There will be no heir.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.447
Not for a while,
maybe not ever.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.882
You're being ridiculous.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.452
Couples fight.
It doesn't mean anything.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.787
I was raped.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.722
When the protestants
attacked the castle.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.025
That is why francis and I
have separate bedrooms.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.526
There's more to it, of course.

24:22.528 --> 24:23.894
Are you worried you're pregnant

24:23.896 --> 24:24.929
With your attacker's child?

24:24.931 --> 24:27.865
You still have only one goal--

24:27.867 --> 24:30.000
A child to secure power,

24:30.002 --> 24:32.703
As your child
increased yours.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.039
I just told you that I...

24:35.041 --> 24:39.810
And your first thought
is how long you have to wait

24:39.812 --> 24:43.481
To be sure I am not giving birth
to a rapist's child.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.583
Well...

24:45.585 --> 24:47.051
Are you past it?

24:49.988 --> 24:50.988
Yes,

24:50.990 --> 24:52.790
I am past that fear,

24:52.792 --> 24:54.058
But I face others.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.494
Darling, I am sorry.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.796
But the man who
violated you

24:58.798 --> 25:02.132
Should not succeed in
damaging your aspirations.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.734
Your aspirations,

25:03.736 --> 25:05.569
Not mine.

25:05.571 --> 25:06.971
What am I to you?

25:06.973 --> 25:10.040
As you have never been
a mother to me.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.142
You see me
as a weapon.

25:12.144 --> 25:16.146
A bargaining chip, a vessel
for your dreams of greatness.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.749
You are more than that.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.118
Yes, I am.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.721
I am more than a marker
to hold an alliance,

25:23.723 --> 25:26.524
Or a breeder for the next
generation or the next.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.659
I am my own person.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.662
A woman grown,
and tonight I realize

25:31.664 --> 25:34.565
That I am utterly
and completely alone.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.901
But when I look
at you,

25:36.903 --> 25:38.669
I feel I am better for it.

25:45.243 --> 25:48.112
Lola, stay with me--
the carriage is on its way.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.247
I love your crown.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.949
So kingly.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.951
Yes, well, that's
the point, I suppose.

25:53.953 --> 25:56.754
But sometimes,
when I look at you,

25:56.756 --> 25:59.056
I don't see a king at all.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.625
I see the young man
you were in paris.

26:01.627 --> 26:04.161
Deep pockets and free to roam.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.831
That was the first
time in my life

26:07.833 --> 26:09.099
That I was outside
the castle walls

26:09.101 --> 26:10.768
And no one knew
where I was.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.770
You were so not you.
(chuckles)

26:12.772 --> 26:15.339
And yet, utterly you.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.109
And a marvelous kisser.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.778
Lola...

26:20.780 --> 26:22.313
You know, I've always wanted
to tell you that.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.014
Objectively, as your friend.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.316
(horse neighing)

26:25.318 --> 26:26.584
Here we are.

26:28.987 --> 26:32.623
I really hope things work out
between you and mary.

26:36.127 --> 26:37.895
Lady lola's not
feeling so well.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.263
Oh, but I am.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.131
Have her servants escort her
to her chambers

26:41.133 --> 26:42.366
And stay with her
through the night.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.701
No stops along the way.

26:43.703 --> 26:44.969
Yes, your majesty.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.151
You're early.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.353
Wasn't expecting
anybody to return

27:02.355 --> 27:03.754
For a few more hours.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.989
What's wrong?

27:05.957 --> 27:07.625
It's nothing.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.059
I saw francis at the party

27:09.061 --> 27:10.894
After lola said
he wouldn't be attending.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.731
That he'd be with you.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.767
The whole castle knew
of your plans tonight.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.402
Why didn't he stay with you?

27:18.404 --> 27:21.038
Because it was
a failure.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
I froze, it pained
him, and...

27:23.042 --> 27:24.041
I'm sorry.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.644
Mary, please, be...

27:26.646 --> 27:28.212
Patient with yourself.

27:29.414 --> 27:31.749
Don't take heart
from this, louis.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.417
It's worse than
ever for us.

27:33.419 --> 27:36.754
Francis knows of our feelings
and has forbidden our union.

27:38.189 --> 27:39.790
"our feelings"?
Are you saying that...?

27:39.792 --> 27:42.092
That I care for you,
of course I do.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.228
You know I do.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.897
Why else would your declaration
frighten me so?

27:48.767 --> 27:50.768
I can promise you nothing,

27:50.770 --> 27:52.703
Given who I am
and what I've been through.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.138
It's all right.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.239
I understand.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.842
Was francis harsh with you?

27:58.844 --> 28:01.078
No.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.213
Not half as harsh
as my mother was.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.750
She has been pressing me
mercilessly for an heir.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.085
Even knowing what I've endured.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.156
Mary, has your mother
been acting herself?

28:12.158 --> 28:13.757
Why do you ask?

28:13.759 --> 28:16.193
At the party, lola was...

28:16.195 --> 28:18.128
Well, fairly levitating
after she had something

28:18.130 --> 28:20.864
To drink
of your mother's.
My mother's?

28:20.866 --> 28:23.267
There was clearly
some powerful narcotic in it.
Is lola all right?

28:23.269 --> 28:26.103
She was in better spirits
than I've ever seen.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.337
Much like others
I've encountered

28:27.339 --> 28:29.807
Who have ingested opiates
or other such herbs.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.241
Mother did try
to give me

28:31.243 --> 28:33.243
A miraculous new
medicine she'd found.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.379
Well, the miracle is that
marie can still walk straight,

28:35.381 --> 28:36.880
Much less give you counsel.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.235
(gasps)
bash.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.970
You're here--
I was missing you.

28:59.972 --> 29:03.841
Yes, it looks like you've
been grieving my absence.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.476
Well, you're here now.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.144
May I offer you
some champagne?

29:07.146 --> 29:08.345
What's all this for?

29:08.347 --> 29:10.881
Is it for us to look
past your hatred of us?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.883
Then why seduce my wife?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.485
Why don't we go
for a walk, baron?

29:14.487 --> 29:16.487
Get some air.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.522
Where did you get those?

29:18.524 --> 29:21.158
Bash, please, not now.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.328
Every time I turn around,
he's beside you.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.163
You were supposed
to meet me.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.165
I sent a message
with antoine's page.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.233
Did you not get it?

29:32.170 --> 29:33.437
He never sent the
message, kenna.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.840
Well, I'll have
a word with my page

29:36.842 --> 29:38.275
And see what
happened.
No message?

29:38.277 --> 29:40.978
Are you sure...?

29:43.381 --> 29:45.382
You're a manipulator.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.117
And a liar.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.421
Bash, please,
just talk to me.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.423
Antoine is a liar.
He tricked me.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.026
But it was you who put yourself
in a position to be tricked.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.028
I planned a party.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.497
I am not excusing
antoine's deception.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.200
I'm wondering why it is
so hard for you to trust me.

30:03.202 --> 30:06.069
Look at yourself--
he's all over you.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.205
The gown,
those jewels.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.240
You may not have strayed
explicitly,

30:10.242 --> 30:12.042
But clearly you want
more than you have.

30:12.044 --> 30:16.380
I do-- I want a good life,
and a husband to share it with.

30:16.382 --> 30:20.050
And I'm sick of being judged for
it just because you want less.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.451
Less comfort.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.287
Less responsibility.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.389
Less of me.

30:41.906 --> 30:43.173
You.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.942
How have I offended you now?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.376
One question.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.348
Could sex with you
be simple?

30:51.350 --> 30:52.950
Not scary?

30:52.952 --> 30:54.952
Just two people.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.020
Or is there
something

30:57.022 --> 31:01.158
Unimaginably dirty
or odd involved?

31:05.063 --> 31:06.496
Ow.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.631
Maybe...

31:07.633 --> 31:09.900
I'm ready to find out.

31:11.236 --> 31:12.502
Lola,

31:12.504 --> 31:14.404
I can tell
that you're not

31:14.406 --> 31:16.340
In your right mind
at the moment.

31:16.342 --> 31:19.910
Oh, not you, too.

31:19.912 --> 31:23.347
And though you are
heart-breakingly tempting,

31:23.349 --> 31:27.351
Were we to come together,
I would want the real you.

31:28.386 --> 31:29.653
(snaps fingers twice)

31:31.089 --> 31:33.657
(whispering):
She smells of ointment.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.360
Escort lady lola
to her chambers.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.896
Have the physician
check on her.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.032
Watch over her.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.073
He didn't even
offer me a bath.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.309
And he always
offers a bath.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.248
What are these herbs
you've been taking, mother?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.316
Some kind of opiate?

31:59.318 --> 32:01.418
You nearly poisoned my friend.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.253
My dear, I am sorry

32:03.255 --> 32:06.156
I have been
such an inadequate mother...

32:06.158 --> 32:07.491
Answer the question.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.326
What are you doing

32:09.328 --> 32:11.395
To dull your
ache for power?

32:11.397 --> 32:14.331
Do you really miss sitting
on my throne that much?

32:14.333 --> 32:16.166
I am dying.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.235
And I'm leaving
you alone

32:18.237 --> 32:21.038
To a terribly uncertain future.

32:22.006 --> 32:23.707
But you look...

32:23.709 --> 32:27.411
The physicians say
it originated in my lymph

32:27.413 --> 32:29.346
And lungs.

32:29.348 --> 32:33.383
I've been taking tinctures
in increasing amounts.

32:33.385 --> 32:36.086
I can't go without them
for even a day,

32:36.088 --> 32:37.621
Or the pain is unbearable.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.723
You will stay here, then.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.159
We will take care of you.
Our physicians...

32:42.161 --> 32:45.062
We are past that.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.397
Listen to me.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.232
I must go back.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.401
James is weak,
and I must help him

32:51.403 --> 32:54.705
With the nobles
for as long as I am able.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.106
(sighs)

32:56.108 --> 32:58.742
I wanted the world for you.

32:58.744 --> 33:02.379
I wanted France and England
to fall at your feet.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.315
But I cannot protect you
when I'm gone.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.185
I couldn't even protect you
when you needed it most.

33:08.187 --> 33:11.521
Nobody could.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.023
But I survived.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.558
You are a fighter.

33:16.027 --> 33:20.464
Fight for yourself,
your country,

33:20.466 --> 33:22.199
Your throne.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.301
Have an heir.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.604
Be... Unassailable.

33:28.406 --> 33:31.608
Lay down your burdens, mother,

33:31.610 --> 33:34.311
So I am no longer your worry.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.179
I promise you,

33:36.181 --> 33:38.048
I will let no one--

33:38.050 --> 33:40.784
Not elizabeth, not any usurper--

33:40.786 --> 33:43.353
Take my country from me.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.322
Since I was a babe,

33:45.324 --> 33:48.158
I have been a queen.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.526
Since a child,

33:49.528 --> 33:52.396
I have been alone
on foreign soil.

33:52.398 --> 33:56.366
I know how to keep my life,
my crown,

33:56.368 --> 33:58.301
And I will.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.576
Kenna.
Have you been following me?

34:06.578 --> 34:08.578
Well, I've-I've been
looking for you.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.781
Well, stay away from me.

34:10.783 --> 34:12.716
I sent back your gowns,
your jewels.

34:12.718 --> 34:16.420
I won't be your revenge against
this family, against my husband.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.721
That's not what I want.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.523
(scoffs)

34:19.525 --> 34:21.458
I want you.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.593
You think that because
I was the king's mistress

34:23.595 --> 34:24.761
That I'm easy prey?

34:24.763 --> 34:26.296
I don't want you
to be revenge.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.597
I don't want you
to be my mistress.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.801
I want you to
be my wife.

34:30.803 --> 34:33.270
I'm a man who knows
what he wants.

34:33.272 --> 34:36.339
And I have never wanted anyone
as much as I want you.

34:38.276 --> 34:39.810
You're married.

34:40.778 --> 34:42.646
Jeanne is dying.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.415
They say she won't
live another month.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.751
And it should tell you something
about the state of our union

34:47.753 --> 34:50.187
That she doesn't
want me by her side.

34:50.189 --> 34:53.356
When she's gone,
I'll take another wife.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.325
I'm married.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.294
It was an act of a mad king,

34:57.296 --> 34:58.795
Which even your church
would overturn.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.497
Forgive me,

35:00.499 --> 35:02.165
But I know the facts.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.501
I also know that your husband
occupies a station

35:04.503 --> 35:06.636
That no woman of your upbringing
could be happy with.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.172
And now you insult me.

35:09.174 --> 35:11.174
You don't know
what makes me happy.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.510
I saw you happy yesterday.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.445
And...

35:15.447 --> 35:17.447
If you are less than happy

35:17.449 --> 35:20.283
In your every day, I wonder if
you might entertain a way out.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.451
A life with me.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.652
(scoffs)

35:22.654 --> 35:24.621
A chance to be a queen.

35:27.658 --> 35:31.128
I was going to ask you how
your evening went with mary,

35:31.130 --> 35:32.562
But I think I know.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.197
It's over.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.233
There's no chance
of us having an heir.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.568
If that makes mary
a less attractive rival

35:38.570 --> 35:40.437
For the english throne,
so be it.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.607
I'll find a way
to navigate the politics.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.842
On her behalf and ours.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.751
Francis, look at me.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.254
I'm not surprised
that mary is

35:57.256 --> 35:59.322
Still incapable
of being intimate.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.726
And it's true, you may never
recover what you had.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.528
For mary's sake,
I hope that you do,

36:04.530 --> 36:07.497
But if not, you are my child,

36:07.499 --> 36:10.934
My concern in this moment.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.636
What makes you happy?

36:13.638 --> 36:15.172
Your son?

36:15.174 --> 36:16.406
A family?

36:16.408 --> 36:18.341
You have that right now.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.776
What are you saying?

36:19.778 --> 36:22.679
I have the deepest compassion
for mary.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.314
But you wear the crown.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.750
Without joy or happiness

36:26.752 --> 36:30.554
In this life, its weight will
crush your spirit into dust.

36:30.556 --> 36:34.357
Mary has released me
to take anyone I wish.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.694
I haven't even entertained
the possibility. Not yet.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.969
Whatever you decide,
I support you.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.872
And if someone here at court
should bring you joy,

36:48.874 --> 36:52.309
Let yourself have it.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.750
(laughter nearby)

37:02.220 --> 37:04.454
(sighing happily)

37:04.456 --> 37:05.488
(kisses)

37:05.490 --> 37:07.357
(laughs)
look at his face.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.925
(whoops, laughs)

37:08.927 --> 37:10.827
Will you take him in?

37:19.904 --> 37:22.672
Last night...

37:22.674 --> 37:25.475
I am mortified and so sorry.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.677
I'm surprised you even remember.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.513
Every granular detail.

37:30.515 --> 37:32.482
Oh, francis,
the things I said...

37:32.484 --> 37:33.650
It's all right.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.685
They were nice things to hear.

37:35.687 --> 37:36.953
From a friend.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.522
I did specify that, didn't I?

37:39.524 --> 37:41.324
That I was saying them
in friendship?

37:41.326 --> 37:43.793
You did, absolutely.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.695
You were perhaps less friendly

37:45.697 --> 37:48.031
About the von amsbergs'
baby's ears.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.767
Oh, god, I...

37:50.769 --> 37:52.002
(both laugh)

38:00.945 --> 38:04.814
Two guinea hen pies--
one for you and one for me.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.716
Though I could eat three.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.485
Sharlene, I don't
have any money.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.788
Take a peek.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.024
Made it all in one night,
thanks to you.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.559
That's two months' rent.

38:16.561 --> 38:19.562
That party was swarming
with eager gentlemen.

38:19.564 --> 38:23.400
Tables and tables of food--
roast duck, a whole pig.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.568
You went inside the party?

38:25.570 --> 38:26.936
My new friend invited me.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.571
Found a dark corner.

38:28.573 --> 38:29.806
He was touchy about the cold.

38:33.778 --> 38:35.812
Easiest money
I ever made.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.848
Highborn gentlemen, nothing
particularly nasty asked.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.684
I want to do it again.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.820
Sharlene, I can't risk you being
discovered at these parties.

38:43.822 --> 38:44.821
We'll be hush.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.423
Never saying anything about you.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.425
"we"?
My friends.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.496
All you have to do
is tell us about the parties

38:53.498 --> 38:54.864
And dress us up.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.334
Make us look... Right.

38:57.336 --> 38:58.968
It sounds easy enough,

38:58.970 --> 39:01.104
But that's not the future
I envisioned for myself.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.873
It doesn't have to be
your whole future.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.343
Just the right now future.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.078
There's money in it
for you, greer.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.946
There's money in it
for all of us.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.983
Oh, well,

39:13.985 --> 39:16.353
All right, then.

39:16.355 --> 39:17.887
(laughs)

39:17.889 --> 39:19.089
All right.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.928
The herbs are
to soften the pain,

39:24.930 --> 39:26.463
Because my mother is dying.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.064
Oh, mary.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.766
Is there no hope for recovery?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.634
No.

39:31.636 --> 39:34.003
And if I am to secure my rule
in her absence,

39:34.005 --> 39:36.506
I must take drastic action.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.411
I'm going to return to scotland
to rule in person,

39:41.413 --> 39:42.879
To remind my people

39:42.881 --> 39:44.414
That I am their queen.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.850
You're leaving, permanently?

39:48.386 --> 39:51.121
Francis agrees with this?

39:51.123 --> 39:53.022
No, he is unaware.

39:53.024 --> 39:56.493
Mary, whatever you need,
I will help you.

39:56.495 --> 39:59.028
There is more.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.799
I am done being a vessel

40:02.801 --> 40:05.101
For other people's
wishes and fears.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.604
I will not wait for a child,
or anyone,

40:07.606 --> 40:09.406
To secure my life and future.

40:09.408 --> 40:10.607
I am seizing it.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.842
And in that light,

40:12.844 --> 40:16.646
What I want is so clear.

40:16.648 --> 40:17.947
I want you.

40:17.949 --> 40:21.418
At my side, as you have been
these many months.

40:21.420 --> 40:25.655
I know it is a huge request,
and I urge you to think on it.

40:25.657 --> 40:28.425
Because if you say yes,
you could be risking your life.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.961
Come to scotland with me.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.931
Where we can be together.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.201
A new life for us both.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.546
Antoine.
What are you doing here?

40:49.548 --> 40:52.715
Basking in my triumphs.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.984
You're not this pleased
over a simple party.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.486
(chuckles) hardly.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.655
I'm pleased for
you, brother.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.089
Bravo.

41:01.559 --> 41:04.894
I've had a message
from England.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.630
Queen elizabeth wants
a stronghold in France,

41:07.632 --> 41:11.601
An alliance with a powerful
noble with a famous name.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.103
She wants you.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.939
Do you hear me?

41:15.941 --> 41:17.707
Elizabeth.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.642
No, y-you're lying.
It can't be true.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.244
Elizabeth is inviting
you to court her.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.112
To see if you
will be her king.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.547
I can't.

41:24.549 --> 41:25.982
Why?

41:25.984 --> 41:27.217
Because you want mary?

41:27.219 --> 41:28.952
Because you're waiting
to be beheaded

41:28.954 --> 41:30.887
At the first mention
of adultery?

41:30.889 --> 41:33.723
You could be ruling England
by elizabeth's side.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.792
And after that, France.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.827
Elizabeth is your future.
