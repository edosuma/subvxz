02:13.967 --> 02:18.763
Bread of heaven
Bread of heaven

02:36.281 --> 02:40.868
In this barren wilderness

02:52.714 --> 02:57.844
Song of praises
Song of praises

02:58.053 --> 03:02.932
I will ever give to thee

03:47.853 --> 03:52.982
Be the Lord my righteousness

03:53.609 --> 03:58.863
Song of praises
Song of praises

03:58.947 --> 04:02.783
I will ever give to thee...

04:19.134 --> 04:22.178
Death of death and hell's...

04:29.645 --> 04:34.732
Song of praises
Song of praises

04:34.942 --> 04:46.160
I will ever give to thee

04:47.037 --> 04:51.999
When I tread the verge of Jordan

04:57.547 --> 05:00.174
Song of praises

05:00.759 --> 05:12.061
I will ever give to thee

05:13.230 --> 05:14.313
Amen.

05:14.398 --> 05:18.442
Amen

05:43.218 --> 05:45.052
- Hello, Reverend.
- Mr. Allnut.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.554
- Here's your mail.
- Thank you.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.348
Sorry I'm late, but one thing and another
kept me in Limbasi.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.726
You know how it is. Maybe you don't.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.270
- Good morning, Mr. Allnut.
- Good morning, miss.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.857
Splendid, they've come at last.
My rose trees.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.900
- You'll stay for tea?
- Don't mind if I do.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.695
I sure need something in my condition.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.864
I'm in for a going over
when I get back to the mine.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.824
Them Belgians are calling me
all the names they can think of,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.993
but I don't mind being cussed out
in a foreign language.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.327
They won't fire me.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.455
Ain't nobody in Africa except yours truly

06:12.539 --> 06:16.125
can get up a good head of steam
on the old African Queen.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.466
You take sugar,
I seem to remember, Mr. Allnut?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.927
That's right, miss. Couple of spoonfuls.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.345
And milk?

07:11.348 --> 07:13.057
That's right, miss.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.071
- Bread and butter?
- That's right, miss.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.574
- Brother.
- Thank you.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.961
Just listen to this stomach of mine.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.840
The way it sounds,
you'd think I had a hyena inside me.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.425
Do have some more
bread and butter, Mr. Allnut.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.220
Thanks, miss. I... I don't mind if I do.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.431
Excuse me.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.690
Queer thing, ain't it? What I mean is,

08:02.774 --> 08:05.401
what do you suppose makes
a man's stomach carry on like this?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.695
Try a rock cake, Mr. Allnut.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.656
No, thanks, miss.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.741
Herbie Morton's a bishop.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.913
- Who's that, dear?
- Dear, surely you remember Herbie.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.041
Blond, a bit younger
than I am, ruddy-faced.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.544
He sang a solo
at the commemoration concert.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.254
Holy, Holy, I think it was.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.215
I think I remember. It was so long ago.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.551
- He's a bishop now.
- Splendid.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.928
Yes, I'd say Herbie was
a bit younger than me,

08:33.054 --> 08:36.682
four or five years. Surprising, really.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.683
He wasn't up to much as a student,

08:38.768 --> 08:41.604
didn't have more than his share
of the social graces.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.106
Then, of course, he married well.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.276
Yes. That manufacturer's widow.

08:48.111 --> 08:52.198
What was his name, Griggs?
Briggs. That was it. Alfred Briggs.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.701
Soap flakes, I think. Mrs. Alfred Briggs.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.163
Not to take anything away from Herbie.
I'm delighted for him, naturally.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.664
Of course.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.877
Ain't a thing I can do about it.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.879
Itwas Holy, Holy.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.839
More tea, Mr. Allnut?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.467
Thank you, no, miss.
I reckon I'd better be shoving off

09:11.551 --> 09:14.053
if I'm to get back to the mine
before tomorrow night.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.722
- Don't hurry, Mr. Allnut.
- Do stay for dinner.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.682
Thanks just the same.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.731
I probably won't be coming around
this way for a couple of months.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.858
Really? Well, what about our mail?

09:27.943 --> 09:30.110
Don't look like there's going
to be any mail for a while.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.403
Why not?

09:31.488 --> 09:34.907
- The Germans will hold it up.
- Why, in heaven's name?

09:34.991 --> 09:38.244
- On account of the war.
- War? Where, Mr. Allnut?

09:38.328 --> 09:41.121
- Europe.
- Indeed. Between whom?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.999
Germany, England...

09:44.084 --> 09:45.084
- England?
- England?

09:45.168 --> 09:47.920
- That's right.
- You really mean war?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.922
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.425
Germans claim the British started it,
British claim it was the Germans.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.219
Well, what do you know about it?
What's happened?

09:55.303 --> 09:58.681
Well, let's see. I...
That's all I can remember.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.308
Yes, the French are in it,
and all them little countries.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.436
Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Spain.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.063
I forget who's with who.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.774
- Is that all you can tell us?
- That's all I know.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.818
I'll see what I can find out
when I get to Limbasi.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.028
Well, I'm wondering
what our position will be. Enemy aliens.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.905
What harm could anybody do
the Germans

10:14.990 --> 10:16.991
in this godforsaken place?

10:17.075 --> 10:19.201
God has not forsaken
this place, Mr. Allnut,

10:19.286 --> 10:21.578
as my brother's presence here
bears witness.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.123
- No offense, miss.
- War.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.667
Yeah. Yeah, looks like it.

10:26.751 --> 10:30.546
Well, I'll be shoving off.
Thanks for the tea.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.464
Take care of yourselves.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.302
- Goodbye. Thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. Allnut.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.973
Wretched little man. What indifference.
He's a Canadian.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.309
Doesn't he realize he's in this, too?

10:43.393 --> 10:45.978
Shouldn't we perhaps try
to get to Limbasi while we can?

10:46.062 --> 10:47.855
A good shepherd
doesn't desert his flock

10:47.939 --> 10:50.149
when the wolves are prowling.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.447
We must ask the Almighty
to bless the arms of England

10:56.531 --> 10:59.241
and carry her through her hour of trial.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.047
Rose, go into the house and stay there.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.341
What's the meaning of this outrage?
How dare you!

13:13.626 --> 13:17.337
Samuel!

13:19.382 --> 13:22.426
Dear, here you are.
And without your hat on.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.178
Didn't you hear me calling you?

13:24.262 --> 13:28.432
Yes, but I must get the seeds in now.
It's a bit late. August.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.895
But, dear, you know it doesn't matter
when one plants in Central Africa.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.398
Africa?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.409
Brother, dear, you're not at all well.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.744
Africa?

13:57.420 --> 14:01.715
- I'll help you off with your things.
- Rose.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.499
Brother. Brother. Dear.

14:44.259 --> 14:49.137
Smite the Amalekites, O Lord.
Smite them, hip and thigh.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.847
Amen.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.810
Cold. Foggy.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.312
Where's Rose?

14:57.981 --> 14:59.773
Rose, are you down there in the shop?

14:59.857 --> 15:00.983
I'm here.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.860
Bring me a nice, hot cup of tea.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.196
I'm here, Brother, beside you.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.324
I try so hard, you know, to study.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.579
Hebrew, Greek. I've got no facility.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.959
If I don't pass the examinations,
I shall volunteer as a missionary.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.794
Rose, too.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.590
Not comely among the maidens,
but she, too, can be a servant

15:24.674 --> 15:26.758
in the house of the Lord.

15:26.843 --> 15:30.345
Even for such as she,
God has a goodly purpose.

15:32.390 --> 15:36.685
I'm going to put my books away.
I'm not going to work anymore.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.772
If I don't pass, it'll just mean
that God has other work for me.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.066
Thy will be done.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.531
O Lord, if it be thy will,
let me distinguish myself.

15:50.491 --> 15:54.745
Give me a call here in England at home.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.998
Mother would be so proud.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.462
O Lord, I've tried so hard.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.618
So they been here, too, eh?

17:17.787 --> 17:21.248
After I left here the other day,
the drums started in the forest.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.876
Pretty soon, my boys was moaning
and rolling their eyes.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.963
I asked them what the trouble was,
and they told me the drums said

17:28.047 --> 17:30.090
the soldiers was rounding up
their people

17:30.174 --> 17:32.217
and marching them off
and burning their villages

17:32.301 --> 17:34.720
so they wouldn't have
no homes to come back to.

17:34.804 --> 17:38.181
Sure enough, when I got to the mine,
everything was a shambles.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.435
My boys took one look
and bolted into the forest.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.398
The way I look at it,
they plan to make soldiers of the natives

17:46.482 --> 17:50.235
and take over all Africa.
Where's the Reverend?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.321
He's in there. He's dead.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.035
Well, now, ain't that awful?

17:59.120 --> 18:02.664
If they'd up and shoot a reverend
couldn't do them a bit of harm,

18:02.749 --> 18:06.960
- well, there ain't nobody safe.
- They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnut,

18:07.044 --> 18:09.337
but they may as well have done.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.009
That's certainly too bad, miss.
That's all I can say.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.764
- When'd he die, miss?
- He died early this morning.

18:19.599 --> 18:24.102
Excuse me, miss. What I mean to say
is, what with the climate and all,

18:24.187 --> 18:26.938
the quicker we get him
under the ground, the better.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.609
If you don't mind my saying so.
You got a spade?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.361
Behind the bungalow.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.948
I expect he'd like to be buried
in the shade.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.034
I'll tell you what.
While I'm digging the grave,

18:39.118 --> 18:41.536
you get your things together,
all the things you want to carry,

18:41.621 --> 18:42.954
and then we can clear out of here
in a hurry.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.540
The Germans might come back anytime.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.794
- Why should they?
- They'll be back, all right,

18:48.878 --> 18:50.253
looking for the African Queen.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.714
They'd give a lot to get their hands
on her, you bet.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.049
And what's in her, too.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.135
Blasting gelatin, tinned grub,
cylinders of oxygen and hydrogen,

18:57.220 --> 19:00.722
heaps of things them Germans
could use. You can trust them for that.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.015
The Germans.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.894
See, I figure we could go somewheres
behind an island where it's quiet

19:05.978 --> 19:08.730
- and we can talk about what to do.
- I'll get ready.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.483
Fine. I'll be as quick as I can.

19:31.379 --> 19:34.464
Let's go, miss.
Let's go while the going's good.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.751
Pardon me.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.151
Mind taking the tiller, miss? Come on.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.154
- But I can't steer.
- Come on.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.958
A little to starboard, miss.
No, no, the other way.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.685
So far, so good.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.271
Here we are, safe and sound,
as you might say.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.774
- The question is, what next?
- Quite.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.818
We got heaps of grub here, miss,
so we're all right as far as that goes.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.947
Two thousand cigarettes.
Two cases of gin.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.407
We could stay here for months
if we wanted to.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.035
It's not a bad place to sit out a war,
then, is it, miss?

21:27.161 --> 21:30.455
All the comforts of home,
including running water.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.582
We simply can't remain here
in this backwater

21:32.667 --> 21:34.793
until the war is over, Mr. Allnut.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.504
Can't we, miss? You got the map.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.381
Show me a way out and I'll take it.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.299
The British will certainly
launch an attack.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.635
The only question is,
which way will they come?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.804
Maybe from the sea,
up the railway to Limbasi.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.639
But that would put the Germans
between us and them.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.141
Mightn't our soldiers
come in from British East, Mr. Allnut?

21:50.226 --> 21:52.519
Yeah, they might,
but the war in Europe would be over

21:52.603 --> 21:55.063
before they ever hacked their way
through that forest.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.941
We're in a bit of a fix, miss,
no matter which way you look at it.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.859
There's one thing certain.
They won't come up from the Congo,

21:59.944 --> 22:02.320
not even if they wanted to.
They gotta cross that lake,

22:02.405 --> 22:04.739
and nothing's going to cross that lake
while the Louisa's there.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.325
- The Louisa? What's that?
- A hundred-ton steamer, miss.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.536
The Germans brought her
overland in sections.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.038
She's the boss of the lake
'cause she's got a six-pounder.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.748
A six-pounder? What's that?

22:13.874 --> 22:17.002
A gun, miss.
The biggest gun in Central Africa.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.837
- I see.
- If it wasn't for the Louisa,

22:18.921 --> 22:20.755
there wouldn't be nothing to it.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.551
The Germans wouldn't last a month
if our men could get across the lake,

22:24.635 --> 22:27.512
but all that don't get us
any closer to home, does it, miss?

22:29.098 --> 22:31.516
This river, the Ulanga,
runs into the lake,

22:31.600 --> 22:33.059
doesn't it, Mr. Allnut?

22:33.144 --> 22:35.854
Well, yes, miss, it does,
but if you got any ideas

22:35.938 --> 22:37.689
about going down to the lake
in this launch,

22:37.773 --> 22:40.108
- you better get rid of them.
- Why?

22:41.027 --> 22:43.153
Well, first off, there's Shona.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.363
The Germans have a fort there
overlooking the river.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.366
If we tried to pass under their guns,
they'd blow us right out of the water.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.368
And then after that, miss,
there's the rapids.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.787
A hundred miles of water
like it was coming out of a fire hose.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.832
After that, why,
the river's even got a different name.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.917
It's called the Bora.
That just goes to show you

22:58.002 --> 22:59.461
they didn't even know
it was the same river

22:59.545 --> 23:02.797
- until this fellow Spengler got...
- He got down it, I remember.

23:02.882 --> 23:06.342
Yes, miss, in a dugout canoe.
He had a half a dozen Swahili paddlers.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.428
Map-making, he was.
That was his map you was looking at.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.346
- Mr. Allnut.
- Yes, miss?

23:10.431 --> 23:14.267
What did you say is in these boxes
with the red lines on them?

23:14.727 --> 23:17.395
Well, them, that's blasting gelatin, miss.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.521
Is it dangerous?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.732
Bless you, no, miss.
That's safety stuff, that is.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.400
You can get it wet
and it don't do it any harm.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.235
You set fire to it, and it just burns.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.404
You can hit it with a hammer
and it won't go off.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.239
At least, I don't think it will.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.908
Takes a detonator to set it off.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.534
I'll put it over the side, though,
if it worries you.

23:31.619 --> 23:32.786
No, we may want it.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.704
- Mr. Allnut.
- Yes, miss?

23:34.789 --> 23:39.042
What are these long, round,
torpedo-like things?

23:39.126 --> 23:42.754
Them? Them's oxygen
and hydrogen cylinders, miss.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.632
- Mr. Allnut.
- I'm still right here, miss.

23:45.716 --> 23:49.219
There ain't much of any other place
I could be on a 30-foot boat.

23:49.386 --> 23:53.431
You're a machinist, aren't you? I mean,
wasn't that your position at the mine?

23:53.516 --> 23:57.143
Yes, a kind of a fixer, jack of all trades
and master of none, like they say.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.772
- Could you make a torpedo?
- How's that, miss?

24:01.440 --> 24:04.776
- Could you make a torpedo?
- A torpedo?

24:07.238 --> 24:09.114
Ask me to make a dreadnought,
and do it up right.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.406
A torpedo, miss...

24:10.491 --> 24:12.450
You don't really know
what you're asking.

24:12.535 --> 24:16.371
You see, there ain't nothing so
complicated as the insides of a torpedo.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.457
It's got gyroscopes, compressed
air chambers, compensating...

24:19.542 --> 24:21.668
But all those things,
those gyroscopes and things,

24:21.752 --> 24:24.254
- they're only to make it go, aren't they?
- Yeah.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.422
Yeah, go and hit what it's aimed at.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.301
Well, we've got the African Queen.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.928
How's that, miss?

24:32.012 --> 24:35.849
If we were to fill those cylinders
with that blasting gelatin

24:35.933 --> 24:37.809
and then fix them so that
they would stick out

24:37.893 --> 24:38.893
over the end of the boat,

24:38.978 --> 24:41.312
and then run the boat
against the side of a ship,

24:41.397 --> 24:44.691
they would go off,
just like a torpedo, wouldn't they?

24:44.775 --> 24:46.609
Yeah, yeah, if they had detonators
in the ends.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.528
We could... What do you call it?
Get a good head of steam up,

24:48.612 --> 24:51.489
and then point the launch toward a ship,
and just before she hits,

24:51.574 --> 24:53.658
we could dive off, couldn't we?

24:54.243 --> 24:56.828
Sure, miss, sure. Absolutely.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.330
There's only one little thing wrong
with your idea.

24:59.415 --> 25:03.668
- There ain't nothing to torpedo.
- Yes, there is.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.254
- There's what?
- Something to torpedo.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.840
- What's that?
- The Louisa.

25:08.924 --> 25:12.010
The Louisa? Now, don't talk silly, miss.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.720
You can't do that. Honest, you can't.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.680
I told you before,
we can't get down the Ulanga.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.098
- Spengler did.
- In a canoe, miss...

25:17.183 --> 25:18.766
- lf a German did it, we can, too.
- Not in no launch.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.018
How do you know? You never tried it.

25:20.102 --> 25:23.188
I never tried shooting myself
in the head, neither.

25:23.272 --> 25:28.276
The trouble with you, miss, is you...
You don't know anything about boats.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.321
In other words,
you are refusing to help your country

25:31.405 --> 25:33.740
in her hour of need, Mr. Allnut?

25:35.242 --> 25:37.202
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.913
Just how would you put it, Mr. Allnut?

25:40.873 --> 25:44.375
All right, miss, have it your own way,
but don't blame me for what happens.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.544
Very well, then. Let's get started.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.838
- What, now, miss?
- Yes, now.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.007
There ain't two hours
of daylight left, miss.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.968
We can go a long way
in two hours, Mr. Allnut.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.639
I'll have to get
the old kettle to boiling and...

25:57.723 --> 26:00.308
Well, do so, Mr. Allnut.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.821
"Could you make a torpedo?

26:15.157 --> 26:17.200
"Well, do so, Mr. Allnut."

26:26.335 --> 26:29.837
A little to starboard, miss. That's right.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.298
Hey, you're doing fine, miss.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.552
It's really quite easy, isn't it, Mr. Allnut?

26:36.637 --> 26:40.431
- Well, you gotta learn to read the river.
- Read the river?

26:40.516 --> 26:42.976
Yeah. You see that
long thing over there,

26:43.060 --> 26:47.730
looks kind of like a "V"?
That means a snag.

26:47.815 --> 26:51.442
Now, this choppy water over here,
that means shallow.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.530
The Queen don't draw much water,
so we can go right over them.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.865
Most boats would
get their bottoms tore up.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.371
And when it's smooth and flat
like that over there,

27:03.455 --> 27:07.500
- does that mean a rock, Mr. Allnut?
- Rock or hippo, miss.

27:07.584 --> 27:12.005
But don't go bumping into no hippo.
Makes them awful mad.

27:12.089 --> 27:15.091
This boat's only big enough
for the two of us.

27:38.365 --> 27:42.618
- What was the matter, Mr. Allnut?
- Feed pump's full of scum and rust.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.289
She gets clogged up.
Kicking her starts her to working again.

27:46.373 --> 27:49.375
I gotta act fast, 'cause one of my boys
dropped a screwdriver

27:49.460 --> 27:51.044
down the safety valve.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.880
What would happen
if you didn't kick her?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.758
Whole boiler would blow up.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.094
But if we're going
downstream, Mr. Allnut,

28:00.179 --> 28:02.347
why do we need the engine at all?

28:02.431 --> 28:05.683
Boat's got to go faster than the water
or you can't steer.

28:05.768 --> 28:09.979
If I was to let the engine die
going down the rapids, we'd be goners.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.025
- Mr. Allnut?
- Yes, miss?

28:14.109 --> 28:16.402
Why don't you dismantle
the safety valve

28:16.487 --> 28:18.237
and remove the screwdriver?

28:18.322 --> 28:20.698
You know, I'm going
to do that one of these days.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.617
The only reason I ain't done it up to now

28:22.701 --> 28:26.662
is that I kind of like kicking her.
She's all I've got.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.656
It's kind of hot work, ain't it, miss?

29:02.157 --> 29:04.909
I could do with a drink.
Excuse me, miss.

29:29.852 --> 29:33.521
- You going to have one, miss?
- No.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.317
- What is it?
- Gin, miss.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.537
- Something the matter, miss?
- No.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.791
How'd you like a nice cup of tea?

29:55.169 --> 29:57.044
I'd like a cup of tea.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.315
Course, it'll taste a little rusty,

30:17.399 --> 30:20.193
but then
we can't have everything, can we?

30:22.070 --> 30:24.989
There you are.
I'll get this out of the way.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.370
- Sugar, miss?
- Thank you.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.080
Don't mention it.

30:43.926 --> 30:47.428
- Have a bit of supper, miss?
- It's too hot to eat.

30:55.812 --> 31:00.316
- How long you been out here, miss?
- About 10 years.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.901
And what part of England
do you come from?

31:01.985 --> 31:04.529
- The Midlands.
- It sounds pretty, anyway.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.739
Yes, it is. It's very pretty.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.491
Ever get homesick?

31:09.785 --> 31:13.037
It's Sunday afternoons I think of most.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.873
The peace and the quiet.

31:15.958 --> 31:20.253
On Sunday afternoons,
I was always sleeping one off.

31:22.005 --> 31:26.217
- This is very, very good.
- Yes, it isn't half bad, is it?

31:26.301 --> 31:29.720
- What brought you to Africa, Mr. Allnut?
- The Zambezi Bridge, miss.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.098
A whole boatload of us Canucks
came over to work on it.

31:32.182 --> 31:33.558
Don't know yet
what they wanted a bridge for,

31:33.642 --> 31:38.396
both sides of the river being the same,
but why does a chicken cross the road?

31:39.523 --> 31:42.692
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing, miss.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.822
Sometimes I wish
I was back rubbing elbows, as they say.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.949
You know, there's nothing
like the jostle and the noise

31:50.033 --> 31:53.369
and the music of a Saturday night
for cheering a fellow up.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.497
The rest of the week
I'd be taking orders from somebody.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.792
Out here, I'm my own boss.
Anyway, I was, until...

32:02.087 --> 32:05.339
You didn't see any crocodiles
in this arm, did you, miss?

32:05.465 --> 32:07.008
Crocodiles? No.

32:07.217 --> 32:10.636
There's no shallows for them.
The current's too swift.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.931
I could do with a bath before I turn in.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.058
I'd like a bath myself.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.894
Well, then, I'll just go up in the bow
and hang off the anchor chain.

32:18.979 --> 32:22.940
You can stay back here in the stern
and do whatever you have to.

32:23.525 --> 32:26.819
Just so long as we don't look,
it won't matter, huh?

32:28.488 --> 32:30.489
Well, how about it, miss?

32:32.034 --> 32:34.243
Very well, Mr. Allnut.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.037
That's the ticket.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.194
- Mr. Allnut.
- Right here.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.699
- I can't get back into the boat.
- I'll give you a hand.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.326
Close your eyes, please, Mr. Allnut.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.956
All right. I'm all right. Thank you.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.713
Mr. Allnut!

35:33.048 --> 35:35.800
Hi. Sorry I woke you, miss.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.593
What are you doing?

35:38.637 --> 35:43.891
- I ain't doing nothing, miss.
- Well, get out this instant.

36:09.251 --> 36:13.587
Mr. Allnut.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.924
You may come in out of the rain.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.100
Thank you, miss.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.113
- Miss.
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?

36:40.615 --> 36:45.953
- I'm sorry I gave you such a turn.
- That's quite all right, Mr. Allnut.

36:47.247 --> 36:50.457
- Good night, miss.
- Good night, Mr. Allnut.

37:24.159 --> 37:27.953
- What a frightfully strong smell.
- What smell?

37:28.330 --> 37:33.042
The river. It smells like marigolds.
Stale ones.

37:33.126 --> 37:37.171
It does, huh?
Not a very good smell for a flower.

37:37.881 --> 37:42.301
- They're very pretty, though, marigolds.
- They are, huh?

37:44.054 --> 37:46.597
- Mr. Allnut?
- Yes, miss?

37:46.681 --> 37:51.560
- The current's quite strong here, isn't it?
- Yes. We're getting near the rapids.

37:51.645 --> 37:54.897
- Really? So soon?
- Just around that bend.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.528
Kind of dangerous.
You better let me take over.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.691
Here you are, miss.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.540
- Well, miss?
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?

39:36.624 --> 39:38.208
- How'd you like it?
- Like it?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.878
- White water, rapids?
- I never dreamed.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.964
I don't blame you for being scared, miss,
not one little bit.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.009
Ain't no person in their right mind
ain't scared of white water.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.595
I never dreamed
that any mere physical experience

39:49.679 --> 39:52.431
- could be so stimulating.
- How's that, miss?

39:52.515 --> 39:55.559
I've only known such excitement
a few times before.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.686
A few times
in my dear brother's sermons,

39:57.771 --> 40:00.397
when the spirit was really upon him.

40:00.482 --> 40:02.274
- You mean you want to go on?
- Naturally.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.735
- Miss, you're crazy!
- I beg your pardon?

40:04.819 --> 40:05.903
You know what would have happened

40:05.987 --> 40:07.529
if we'd come up against
one of them rocks?

40:07.614 --> 40:08.739
But we didn't.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.659
I must say, I'm filled with admiration
for your skill, Mr. Allnut.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.746
Do you suppose
after I've practiced steering a bit,

40:15.830 --> 40:19.208
- that someday I might try?
- Miss, let me tell you something.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.335
Them rapids ain't nothing
to what's out in front of us.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.837
On second thoughts,
I wouldn't call them rapids at all.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.673
- I can hardly wait.
- But, miss...

40:26.758 --> 40:28.717
Now that I've had a taste of it,

40:28.802 --> 40:31.720
I don't wonder
you love boating, Mr. Allnut.

40:51.533 --> 40:54.868
Is something the matter, Mr. Allnut?
Tell me.

40:58.081 --> 41:01.208
Nothing. Nothing you'd understand.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.293
I simply can't imagine
what could be the matter.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.797
It's been such a pleasant day.
What is it?

41:06.881 --> 41:11.301
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?
- All this foolish talk about the Louisa,

41:11.386 --> 41:14.429
- going down the river.
- What do you mean?

41:14.514 --> 41:16.557
I mean we ain't going to do
nothing of the sort.

41:16.933 --> 41:19.017
Of course we are. What an absurd idea.

41:19.102 --> 41:22.521
"What an absurd idea.
What an absurd idea."

41:22.605 --> 41:26.233
Lady, you got 10 absurd ideas
for my one.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.322
Just why don't you want
to go on, Mr. Allnut?

41:32.407 --> 41:34.741
- The river and Shona.
- Shona?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.410
You're darn right, Shona.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.079
All it would take would be one bullet
in the blasting gelatin

41:39.164 --> 41:41.957
and we'd be in little bits and pieces.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.835
- Then we'll go by night.
- No, we won't.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.045
After Shona, there's the rapids.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.757
Nobody in their might rind would
tackle the rapids at night.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.009
But then we'll go in the daylight.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.969
We'll go on the far side
of the river from Shona,

41:54.053 --> 41:57.139
- just as fast as ever we can.
- No, we won't.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.810
- You agreed to go.
- I never did.

42:01.895 --> 42:04.271
I never agreed to nothing.

42:04.355 --> 42:09.026
You are a liar, Mr. Allnut,
and what is worse, you are a coward.

42:10.236 --> 42:14.489
Coward yourself.
You ain't no lady. No, miss.

42:14.574 --> 42:17.659
That's what my poor old mother
would say to you.

42:18.119 --> 42:21.246
If my poor old mother were to hear you...

42:21.331 --> 42:22.539
Whose boat is this, anyway?

42:22.624 --> 42:25.042
I asked you on board
'cause I was sorry for you,

42:25.126 --> 42:28.128
on account of you losing
your brother and all.

42:28.630 --> 42:31.798
That's what you get
for feeling sorry for people.

42:32.550 --> 42:37.971
Well, I ain't sorry no more, you crazy,
psalm-singing, skinny old maid!

42:47.815 --> 42:50.776
There was a bold fisherman

42:51.110 --> 42:54.780
Set sail from off Pimlico

42:55.949 --> 42:58.075
And when he got off Pimlico

42:58.159 --> 43:00.702
The winds did begin to blow

43:00.787 --> 43:03.956
And the little boat wibble-wobbled so

43:04.707 --> 43:08.293
That overboard went he

43:08.378 --> 43:12.130
Singing twinkie deedledum

43:14.509 --> 43:16.426
Twinkie deedledee

43:16.511 --> 43:21.139
Was the highly interesting
song that he sung

43:21.224 --> 43:23.475
Twinkie deedledum

43:23.559 --> 43:25.852
Twinkie deedledee...

43:55.049 --> 43:58.885
Miss. Have pity, miss.

44:03.182 --> 44:05.726
You don't know what you're doing, miss.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.437
I'll perish without a hair of the dog.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.230
Miss.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.942
It ain't your property!

44:17.655 --> 44:19.323
What a headache.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.430
There was a bold fisherman

44:43.514 --> 44:45.891
Set sail from off Pimlico

44:46.392 --> 44:47.392
To catch...

44:52.648 --> 44:55.192
But when he got off Pimlico

44:55.735 --> 44:57.110
The one...

44:59.781 --> 45:03.367
It's a great thing
to have a lady aboard with clean habits.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.202
Sets a man a good example.

45:05.286 --> 45:08.413
A man alone,
he gets to living like a hog.

45:09.791 --> 45:12.709
Then, too, with me,
it's always putting things off.

45:12.794 --> 45:16.004
Never do today what you
can put off till tomorrow.

45:17.256 --> 45:21.093
But with you,
business before pleasure, every time.

45:21.177 --> 45:24.596
Do all your personal laundry.
Make yourself spic-and-span,

45:24.680 --> 45:29.184
get all the mending out of the way,
and then, and only then,

45:29.268 --> 45:32.646
sit down for a nice, quiet hour
with the Good Book.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.650
I tell you, it's a model,
like an inspiration.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.986
Why, I ain't had this old engine
so clean in years, inside and out.

45:40.780 --> 45:44.241
Just look at her, miss.
See how she practically sparkles?

45:44.325 --> 45:45.951
Myself, too.

45:46.828 --> 45:48.078
Guess you haven't never
had a look at me

45:48.162 --> 45:50.622
without my whiskers and all cleaned up.

45:50.706 --> 45:51.998
I'll bet you wouldn't hardly recognize me.

45:52.083 --> 45:55.252
Works that much of a change.
Freshens you up, too.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.340
If I only had some clean clothes like you.

46:00.425 --> 46:03.927
Now, you, why, you could be at high tea.

46:04.971 --> 46:08.432
Say, that's an idea, miss.
How's about a nice little cup of tea?

46:08.516 --> 46:11.893
Now, don't you stir.
I'll be glad to make it for you.

46:31.581 --> 46:33.373
How's the book, miss?

46:34.041 --> 46:35.459
Well, not that I ain't read it.
That is to say,

46:35.543 --> 46:38.712
my poor old mom used to read me
stories out of it.

46:39.839 --> 46:42.215
How's about reading it out loud?

46:43.551 --> 46:47.095
I could sure do with a little
spiritual comfort, myself.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.727
And you call yourself a Christian.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.605
Do you hear me?

46:57.231 --> 47:00.442
Don't you?

47:20.379 --> 47:23.173
What you being so mean for, miss?

47:23.257 --> 47:26.134
A man takes a drop too much
once in a while.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.178
It's only human nature.

47:28.262 --> 47:32.432
Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put
in this world to rise above.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.185
Miss.

47:36.437 --> 47:39.356
I'm sorry. I apologize.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.109
What more can a man do
than say he's sorry?

47:45.321 --> 47:47.405
You done paid me back, miss.

47:47.490 --> 47:49.824
You didn't even leave me a drop.

47:51.244 --> 47:53.537
Miss, have a heart. Fair is fair.

47:53.621 --> 47:54.621
You gotta say something.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.915
I don't care what it is,
but you gotta say something.

47:56.999 --> 48:01.127
I'll be honest with you, miss,
I just can't stand no more of this.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.838
I just ain't used to it, that's all.

48:03.923 --> 48:07.217
So you think it was your
nasty drunkenness I minded?

48:07.927 --> 48:11.471
- Well, what else?
- You promised you'd go down the river.

48:11.973 --> 48:16.309
Miss, listen to me and try to understand.

48:17.103 --> 48:20.313
There's death a dozen times over
down the river.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.608
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but don't blame me. Blame the Ulanga.

48:23.693 --> 48:26.861
- You promised.
- Well, I'm taking my promise back!

48:45.006 --> 48:50.135
All right, miss, you win,
as the crocodiles will be glad to hear.

48:50.219 --> 48:52.053
Down the river we go.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.015
Have some breakfast, Mr. Allnut.

48:55.099 --> 48:58.184
Thanks for asking, and I don't mind
if I do, because it'll be my last.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.854
Or, no. Get up steam.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.689
Breakfast can wait.

49:11.073 --> 49:13.408
Waiting for their supper, miss.

49:22.376 --> 49:25.253
Which side of the river is Shona on?

49:25.338 --> 49:26.630
How's that, miss?

49:26.714 --> 49:29.341
Which bank is Shona on?

49:29.425 --> 49:31.343
Over to starboard, miss.

49:31.427 --> 49:34.346
Good. Then the sun will be in their eyes.

49:36.474 --> 49:39.559
I say the sun will be in their eyes.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.787
Don't be worried, Mr. Allnut.

49:58.871 --> 50:00.914
I ain't worried, miss.

50:00.998 --> 50:04.000
Gave myself up for dead
back where we started.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.007
Mr. Allnut.

50:17.223 --> 50:19.099
Better get down, miss.

50:59.014 --> 51:00.432
Come here.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.726
Fire over the ship!

51:09.775 --> 51:11.568
Get down lower, miss.

51:47.521 --> 51:50.148
Nothing to do but let her drift, miss.

53:09.895 --> 53:12.105
Are we going to be all right, Mr. Allnut?

53:12.189 --> 53:14.357
Yes. Everything's all right.

53:14.567 --> 53:16.276
If we can keep the steam up

53:16.360 --> 53:19.362
and the boiler don't bust
and that mend holds.

53:20.072 --> 53:22.615
And we don't pile up on them rocks.

54:59.797 --> 55:02.465
We made it! We made it!

55:02.549 --> 55:04.258
Hip, hip, hooray!

55:04.343 --> 55:06.928
We sure put one over on them
that time, didn't we, miss?

55:07.012 --> 55:08.554
What a curious feeling
to have people shooting at you.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.348
They were that surprised
to see the African Queen,

55:10.432 --> 55:12.016
they didn't start shooting
till we were past.

55:12.101 --> 55:14.394
One knows it's dangerous,
and yet one isn't afraid at all!

55:14.478 --> 55:16.062
They didn't believe
we'd try to go down the gorge!

55:16.146 --> 55:18.481
I suppose it's because the bullets
sound like mosquitoes.

55:18.565 --> 55:19.857
They didn't believe anybody could!

55:19.942 --> 55:21.776
I felt like slapping at them.

55:21.860 --> 55:25.321
Well, we showed them!
Hip, hip, hooray!

55:35.207 --> 55:39.252
Was my handling of the boat all right?

55:39.336 --> 55:42.588
Well, yes, miss.
It was better than all right, miss.

55:43.132 --> 55:48.219
Well, we're running short of fuel.
We better put in someplace.

56:13.037 --> 56:17.206
Well, I guess I better do some pumping.
We'll be swimming pretty soon.

56:17.291 --> 56:18.833
- Let me do that.
- No, miss.

56:18.917 --> 56:21.711
No, please, let me
while you get the fuel.

56:23.547 --> 56:26.924
Hey, easy does it, miss.
Don't wear yourself out.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.634
Picked up a thorn in my foot.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.012
Must have gone right through
the rubber sole.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.597
Let me.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.779
Thank you, miss.

57:42.042 --> 57:47.463
Do you recognize these flowers,
Mr. Allnut?

57:49.842 --> 57:52.051
I've never seen them before.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.889
Well, I can't say as I have, either.

57:56.974 --> 57:59.559
Perhaps no one has.

57:59.643 --> 58:02.270
I don't suppose they even have a name.

58:03.397 --> 58:07.358
Whether they have or not,
they sure are pretty.

59:23.477 --> 59:24.852
Mr. Allnut.

59:27.606 --> 59:28.689
Dear.

59:34.154 --> 59:38.282
Well. Well, now.

59:40.327 --> 59:43.537
This is more like it, breakfast in bed.

59:44.873 --> 59:47.208
Two spoonfuls of sugar is right, isn't it?

59:47.292 --> 59:50.544
Fancy your building the fire and all
while I slept.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.718
Dear, what is your first name?

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:04.350
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:10.106
That's a nice name. Charlie, Charlie.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.732
Give us a kiss.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.407
Charlie. Charlie.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:25.162
You know, the more I look at this place,
the prettier it gets.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:27.915
I expect it's just about
the prettiest place I've ever been to,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.625
and that's saying a lot.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.420
Not that I ain't all for going on
down the river, you understand.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.965
The sooner we blow up
the old Louisa, the better.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.633
What I meant was,

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.387
I'd like to come back here someday.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.472
Then you think we can do it?

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:45.016
Do it? Of course we can do it.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.935
Nothing a man can't do
if he believes in himself.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.313
Never say die, that's my motto.

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:52.565
I've had misgivings.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:55.526
I was beginning to think
that the whole thing was a mistake.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.987
How's that, miss, I mean, Rosie?

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.406
I had a moment of weakness.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.615
Now, if you're feeling weak,

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.160
a day or two more here
won't make any difference.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.912
Oh, no. We'll go on.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:10.750
Thank heaven for your strength, Charlie.

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:38.944
Oh, no!

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.266
Charlie.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.531
Hey, Rosie. Listen.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:11.954
We nearly done it that time,
didn't we, Rosie?

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.873
I wonder how much damage we've done.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.333
Let's get the water out and see.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:33.100
Yeah, better than we could've hoped for.
The skin seems tight enough.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:34.310
No water coming in.

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.313
What was all that clattering
just before we stopped?

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.690
That's what we gotta find out, old girl.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.525
How are you going to do that, dear?

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:44.778
I gotta go down underneath
and take a look.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:47.740
I hope there's no fancy currents
down there.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.203
Well, here goes.

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:16.727
Could you see anything, dear?

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:21.065
Yeah. The shaft's twisted
like a corkscrew

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:24.360
and there's a blade gone off the prop.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:26.529
We'll have to mend it, then.

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:30.282
Mend it? Fat chance.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.077
Why is that, dear?

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:36.539
What should we have to do
before we can go on?

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.040
I'll tell you.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:41.877
I'll tell you what we could do
if we was back in the slip at Limbasi.

01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:45.548
We could pull this old tub out
and take the shaft down

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:49.134
and haul it over to the workshop
and forge it straight again.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.637
Then we could write to the makers
for a new prop.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.013
They might even have one in stock,

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:55.891
on account of how
this boat's only 30 years old.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:05:00.312
Then while we was waiting, we could
clean her bottom and paint her up.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.941
Then we'd put the new
shaft in and the new prop

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:06.402
and go on our way
as if nothing had happened.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.404
But this ain't Limbasi.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:13.993
Couldn't you straighten the shaft
without taking the boat up on shore?

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.787
I don't know. I might.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:20.207
Means working underwater.
Could be done, maybe.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:24.336
If you could get the shaft up on shore,
could you straighten it?

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:29.383
I ain't got no anvil, I ain't got no hearth,
I ain't got no coal, I ain't got nothing.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:34.680
I saw a Masai native working once
using charcoal on a big hollow stone.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.099
He had a boy to fan the charcoal.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.143
Yeah, yeah. I've seen that.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:42.688
I'd use a bellows myself.
Could make one easy enough.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.982
Well, if you think that would be better.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:49.028
Well, lots and lots of firewood
on the bank.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.948
Why don't you try it?

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:58.037
No, no. It ain't no use, Rosie.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.290
I was forgetting the prop.
The blade's gone.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.626
Can't we go on the blades that are left?

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.169
No. The prop would be out of balance.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:08.839
The shaft would be all twisted up
like a corkscrew again.

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:10.799
We'll have to make a new blade, then.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:14.219
There's lots of iron and stuff
that you could use.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.971
Yeah. Tie it on!

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:21.602
Well, if you think that would do,
but wouldn't it be better to weld it on?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:26.106
Isn't that the right word, dear?
Weld it on?

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.320
You're a one, Rosie. Really, you are.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.781
Well, isn't "weld" the right word, dear?

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:34.865
You know what I mean,

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:37.368
- even if it isn't, don't you?
- Yes.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.090
I swallowed half the river that time.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.509
You were down there
an awfully long time. I was scared.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:56.470
The shaft don't seem
to want to come out. It's stuck, like.

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:59.348
Charlie, let me help you.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:00.849
How do you mean?
What do you think you're going to do?

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.851
- I'm going to go down there, too.
- Rosie, are you cracked?

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.978
The currents down there are fierce.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.523
I don't want a drowned woman
on my hands.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.483
What will you be thinking of next?

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.612
Well, here goes.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:38.011
If my old dad had put me to
blacksmithing when I was a kid,

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:41.140
I don't think
I should have ever come to Africa.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.226
I might have...

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:47.187
But then I wouldn't have met you,
Rosie, old girl.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.522
Charlie.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.733
Now.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.026
There.

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:55.237
Yeah, that's about as good
as I can get it.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.030
Didn't take so long, neither.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:08:00.701
The blade will be a different thing.
I gotta make that.

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.313
It turns right enough,
but that don't mean nothing.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:33.233
Question is, will she stand up
under a full head of steam?

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:36.779
Well, we'll get the answer out there,

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.948
but the Lord help us
if it ain't the right one.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.578
Looks like this old river got tired
of all the running and jumping she did

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.247
and decided to lay down
and rest for a while.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:34.377
This must be where the river
changes her name from Ulanga to Bora.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.341
Pinch me, Rosie.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:43.178
Here we are, going down the river

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:46.640
like Antony and Cleopatra
on their barge.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:58.068
If it hadn't been for you, this couldn't be.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:01.280
- Don't you feel proud of yourself?
- Certainly not.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.323
Look at the way
you kept the engine going.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:07.202
Look at how you mended the propeller.
It wasn't me at all.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:09.705
I don't think there's another man alive
who could've done it.

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:12.875
Right you are, Rosie,
'cause no other man alive's got you.

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:15.002
- Charlie.
- I'll never forget the way you looked

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:16.879
going over the falls.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:20.215
Head up, chin out,
hair blowing in the wind.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.718
The living picture of a heroine.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:25.721
Fancy me a heroine.

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.265
Charlie, you've lost your mind.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.685
Lost my heart, too.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.397
Shall we drop the anchor, sweetheart?

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:39.985
If the river needs to rest for a while,
I suppose we do, too.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.502
Rosie, I got a feeling that pretty soon

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.213
we're going to wish we was
back shooting the rapids.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:05.135
This is awful. We gotta get out of here.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:07.471
- We ain't got no steam.
- I'm going in.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:10.599
- I'm going under the water.
- Yeah, that's it.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:13.101
- No.
- But I'm being eaten alive!

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.770
What's that you said
about being eaten alive?

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:16.104
Look at that.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:19.232
Get me out of here, Charlie!
I cannot stand it!

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.864
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.451
Golly! Golly! My! Hurry!

01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:46.468
Charlie!

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:52.391
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:22.629
We got away from them.
You can come out now.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:29.553
I'm ashamed of myself, Charlie,
acting this way,

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.889
but I couldn't help it. I was going mad.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.976
You're so bitten.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:39.730
The bites themselves ain't so bad.
It's having them all around you.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:43.233
I've heard of them driving buffalo
and native cattle stark-staring mad,

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:46.737
so they just run and run
till they fall down dead.

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.574
Will it be that way wherever we tie up?

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:52.159
Probably.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:54.870
What are we going to do, Charlie?

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:58.165
Well, if the river keeps straight
and deep and slow,

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.042
there ain't nothing much can hurt us.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:03.086
I'll let the anchor out a way.
That'll keep us out of trouble.

01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:16.141
How much further do you suppose
it is to the lake, Charlie?

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.185
Well, not so many miles,
as the crow flies.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.270
No telling how many days.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:24.149
All depends on how much
winding around this old river does.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.489
What a time we've had, Rosie.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.283
What a time.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:38.330
We'll never lack for stories
to tell our grandchildren, will we?

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.730
Nothing but grass and papyrus
as far as you can see.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.066
Which is the main channel?

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:08.735
Don't look like there is one.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.155
What are we going to do, Charlie?

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.740
I don't know.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:19.454
We can't just go round
and round here forever.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.958
We can't just go round and round.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:28.004
Well, if we get in there and the grass
closes in back of the stern,

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.965
there's no going back, Rosie.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:34.678
If anything happens, we just sit there
till we go off our heads with fever.

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:36.888
I know it.

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:38.890
All right.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.102
You pays your money
and you takes your choice.

01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:46.064
- That way.
- Put her over.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:51.046
We've come along by steam,
we've paddled and pushed

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:54.090
and pulled this old boat
along with the hook.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:58.887
What we ain't done up to now
is get out and carry her.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.056
Looks like that'll come next.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.308
Hard to breathe, the air is so heavy.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:07.062
Yeah. You can't tell it from the water,

01:16:07.939 --> 01:16:10.774
or the water from the land,
for that matter.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:17.155
All the channels we've lost,
all the twisting and turning we've done.

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:21.576
We may come out back
where we started, if we come out at all.

01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:25.038
We've always followed the current,
what little there is of it.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:27.249
That don't mean nothing with this river.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.627
This river's crazy, crazy as I am.

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:35.465
- Charlie, Charlie.
- Sorry, old girl.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:37.926
Well...

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:43.014
The only thing that'll put the roses
back in our cheeks is to

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.308
get out of these reeds.

01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:57.612
What I said about having to get out
and carry this old boat

01:16:57.697 --> 01:16:59.572
was meant to be a joke.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:02.867
It don't look like a joke now. Well...

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:55.170
The little beggars.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:02.927
Pull them off me.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:05.638
No, no.
The heads stay in, poison your blood.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.932
Salt. Salt, salt.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:22.947
Your legs.

01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:42.050
If there's anything in the world I hate,
it's leeches.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.135
The filthy little devils.

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.189
There.

01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:21.399
There, dear, there, there.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.403
Fine specimen of a man I am, ain't I?

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:28.448
You're the bravest man that ever lived.

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.326
You just overdo, that's all.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:34.037
What you need is a few hours' sleep.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:41.711
There. Now, are you all comfortable?
Go to sleep, dear.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:45.507
When you wake up,
we'll be on our way again.

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:47.717
- Rosie.
- Yes, Charlie.

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:51.137
You want to know the truth, don't you?

01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:54.015
Even if we had all our strength, we...

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:58.269
We'd never get her off this mud.
We're finished.

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:00.605
I know it.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:04.859
But, Rosie, I'm not one bit sorry I came.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:09.280
What I mean is, it was worth it.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.547
Dear Lord,

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:30.510
we've come to the end of our journey.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:34.138
In a little while, we will stand before you.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:38.434
I pray for you to be merciful.

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:43.982
Judge us not for our weakness,
but for our love.

01:21:45.276 --> 01:21:49.320
And open the doors of heaven
for Charlie and me.

01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:14.776
Rosie.

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:16.694
Rosie, dear.

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:19.238
Look. We're on the lake.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.742
The rain did it,

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:27.205
just lifted the old Queen up
and carried her over the mud.

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:30.541
We couldn't have been
100 yards from it last night.

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:32.919
Look. Look, Rosie.

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:41.886
Let's build the fire
and get the engine started

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.221
and go right out into the middle,

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:45.306
away from these reeds
where we can breathe.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:48.476
Sure, sure. We'll be out of here in a jiffy.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:02.031
This air, isn't it wonderful?

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:03.783
Yeah. It's like...

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.328
I know you don't approve,
but it's like a shot of gin.

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:11.040
It makes your blood race,
your face numb and your spirit soar.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.668
I'm sorry I poured that gin out, Charlie.

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:15.336
Forget it, Rosie.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.838
And just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

01:26:16.922 --> 01:26:19.298
I'll make you another cup of tea.

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:28.432
You carry on more over a cup of tea
than I do over a glass of gin.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.271
Is it?

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.566
Yes, it's the Louisa,
and she's coming right toward us.

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.901
She must be doing a good 12 knots.

01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:42.196
We've got to make a run for it,
back to the reeds.

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:45.927
She's coming right toward us.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:01.275
I thought for a minute they'd seen us.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.028
They're going toward that island.

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:09.408
They'll probably anchor there
for the night and leave in the morning.

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:12.995
Don't you worry, they'll be back again.
You know how the Germans are.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.123
They lays down systems
and then they sticks to them.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.084
Monday, they're one place,

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:20.211
Tuesday, someplace else, and

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:23.464
then Wednesday, they'll be back here.

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:26.968
How long will it take
to get the torpedoes ready?

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.719
I don't know.

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:31.013
It depends on the detonators.

01:28:31.098 --> 01:28:33.391
We've got to devise something.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.688
I know what you're thinking, Rosie.

01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:41.440
You're thinking of taking the Queen
out at night

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:44.402
when the Louisa comes back,
ain't you, old girl?

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:47.822
Well, we ought to manage it.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:54.286
There, that ought to work.
When we ram into it,

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:56.497
the ends of these nails
will hit the percussion caps

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:58.499
and shoot the bullets into the gelatin.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.501
Charlie, you're wonderful.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:03.004
Can't put them in the cylinders yet.
They're pretty tricky.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:05.464
We'll put them in
when we're ready to start.

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:07.008
It will be dark by then.

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.467
Do you think that you can do it
in the dark?

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:10.428
It's a case of have to.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.680
You're quite sure
that they will come back

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.515
with the Louisa, aren't you, Charlie?

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.017
Dead sure.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:19.603
Let me see, the lake's 100 miles long,
50 miles wide.

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:22.440
Louisa does about... About 12 knots.

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.943
That's 120 miles a day. Yep.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.280
She'll be back here tomorrow.

01:29:30.741 --> 01:29:33.367
When she comes,
we'll be ready for her.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:44.795
Charlie, let's make the Queen
as clean as we can,

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.423
scrub her decks and polish her brass.

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.717
Sure. She ought to look her best,

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:52.595
representing, as she does,
the Royal Navy.

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:02.772
- You know, Rosie, I've been thinking.
- Yes, Charlie?

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.777
Now, there ain't no use
of us both going to do it.

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:11.072
Now that I've had time to study it,
I can plainly see it's a one-man job.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:13.282
You couldn't be more right,
Charlie dear.

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:15.159
Well now, Rosie,
I'm glad you agree with me.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.369
When the time comes,
I'll put you off on the east shore.

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:19.580
You'll wait there for me
while I attend to the Louisa.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.791
Certainly not.
You're the one to be put ashore.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.000
- Me?
- This whole thing

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:25.878
was my idea, wasn't it?
I'm the logical one to carry it out.

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:28.964
Why, Rosie, I'm surprised at you!
You're a very sensible woman as a rule.

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:30.716
Now, we won't have any more talk
along those lines.

01:30:30.801 --> 01:30:32.802
Now, look here, Charlie Allnut,
I can manage this boat

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:34.553
every bit as well as you can
and you know it.

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:36.597
Rosie, you're cracked.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:39.058
Didn't I steer going down the rapids?

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:41.268
You steer well enough, but you
don't know nothing about the engine.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:43.562
Suppose she broke down on you
out there? Wouldn't you look foolish?

01:30:43.647 --> 01:30:45.606
Now, me,
I'd just walk back from the tiller

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:47.441
and do a thing or two to that old engine.

01:30:47.526 --> 01:30:51.028
You know, spit on her, kick her in the
slats and she'd go right to work again.

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:55.032
She knows who's boss, all right,
you bet that old engine does.

01:30:55.117 --> 01:30:59.036
- I suppose you're right.
- Well, now, that's all settled.

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:01.205
I'll dive off a second before the crash

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.249
and swim over to where
you'll be waiting on the east shore

01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:04.875
and we'll be off to Kenya together.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.837
No, I meant it may be necessary
for you to come along.

01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:09.463
Come along? What do you mean?

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:11.966
Didn't we just agree
this was a one-man job?

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:15.636
But you convinced me that it isn't,
so now it's settled. We'll go together.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.765
No, we won't.
You'll wait for me on the east shore.

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:22.184
Who do you think you are,
ordering me about?

01:31:22.269 --> 01:31:24.353
I'm the captain, that's who.

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:26.647
And I ain't taking you along.
You'd only be in my way.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:29.942
I suppose I was in your way
going down the rapids.

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:33.028
Then what you said to me
back there on the river was a lie

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:36.157
about how you never
could have done it alone

01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:40.077
and how you'd lost your heart
and everything.

01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:41.620
You liar.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:48.085
Charlie, we're having our first quarrel.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.213
Rosie.

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:54.675
It's only that
I just can't bear the thought of...

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.511
Well, what I mean is,
suppose something should happen,

01:31:57.596 --> 01:31:59.221
not that anything will, but...

01:31:59.306 --> 01:32:01.599
Don't you understand, Charlie?

01:32:02.392 --> 01:32:05.603
I wouldn't want to go on to Kenya
without you.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:10.649
Rosie. All right.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.570
It'll be you at the tiller
and me at the engine,

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.072
just like it was from the start.

01:32:20.285 --> 01:32:23.162
And there's the Louisa, right on time.

01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:00.824
It's blowing up a bit.
We'd better get started, all right?

01:34:03.346 --> 01:34:08.058
Charlie. Charlie, I can't steer.
It's hard to steer.

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:11.729
Too much water in the bow.
Screw's out of the water half the time.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:18.902
We've got to get her nose up
or we'll be in trouble.

01:34:47.766 --> 01:34:49.600
Rosie, we're sinking.

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:32.768
Rosie!

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:37.648
Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

01:35:39.526 --> 01:35:40.651
Rosie!

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:45.781
What is your nationality?

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:49.910
French? Belgian? British?

01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:52.704
- Yeah.
- Yes, what?

01:35:54.124 --> 01:35:57.042
- British.
- What were you doing on the island?

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:00.337
Fishing.

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:04.091
You are aware that the punishment
for giving false testimony

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:07.469
before this court is death by hanging?

01:36:07.554 --> 01:36:09.096
Who cares?

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.682
What were you doing on the island?

01:36:12.809 --> 01:36:15.477
- I was fishing.
- How did you get there?

01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:17.938
I swam.

01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:19.690
Do you know that you are in an area

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:22.109
prohibited to all
but members of the forces

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:25.696
of His Imperial Majesty
Kaiser Wilhelm II?

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:26.947
Who cares?

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:29.158
You are accused of being a spy

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:32.244
in the service
of the British Armed Forces.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:37.040
Have you anything to say that might lead
this court to believe otherwise?

01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:39.334
I told you I was fishing.

01:36:57.896 --> 01:36:59.980
The court sentences you
to death by hanging.

01:37:00.064 --> 01:37:02.858
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:22.836
Was there a woman with you?

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:31.803
Rosie. Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

01:37:31.888 --> 01:37:33.931
- Charlie!
- Rosie!

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:37.226
Charlie!

01:37:39.979 --> 01:37:41.605
Who's that woman?

01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:45.943
- I don't know.
- You just called her by name.

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:48.153
I thought she was somebody else.

01:37:48.238 --> 01:37:50.656
I shall hang you twice, I think.

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:58.705
- Charlie, dear.
- Rosie.

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.044
Who are you?

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:07.756
Miss Rose Sayer.

01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:10.801
English?

01:38:11.469 --> 01:38:12.803
Of course.

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:18.392
- What were you doing on the lake?
- I ain't told him nothing, Rosie.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:19.810
Silence!

01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:28.318
- What were you doing on the lake?
- We were boating.

01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:30.612
Last night? In such weather?

01:38:30.697 --> 01:38:33.407
We were not responsible
for the weather.

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:35.742
As your fellow prisoner
has already learned,

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:39.121
the penalty for not
answering this court is death.

01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:44.042
You mean he... Charlie?
Stop that!

01:38:44.127 --> 01:38:45.335
Order.

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:47.254
Are they going to hang you, Charlie?

01:38:47.338 --> 01:38:51.675
Fraulein Sayer, you will come to order
and answer the question of this court.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.302
Very well. Ask your questions.

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:54.928
What were you doing on the lake?

01:38:55.013 --> 01:38:56.722
- We came here to sink this ship.
- Rosie!

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:58.307
- And we would have, too, except...
- Rosie!

01:38:58.391 --> 01:39:00.559
Let's at least have the pleasure
of telling them about it, Charlie.

01:39:00.643 --> 01:39:01.643
Sink this ship?

01:39:01.728 --> 01:39:04.021
Don't you believe her, Your Honor.
She's touched, you know. Fever.

01:39:04.105 --> 01:39:05.939
Stop that, Charlie.
We've been through all that.

01:39:06.024 --> 01:39:09.026
I'm certainly not going to outlive you,
and that's all there is to it.

01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:13.238
And just how, Fraulein, did you propose
to sink the Konigin Louise?

01:39:14.324 --> 01:39:15.907
With torpedoes.

01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:18.368
Torpedoes?

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:22.748
Will you be so good as to tell us exactly

01:39:22.832 --> 01:39:25.959
where and how
you acquired torpedoes?

01:39:26.044 --> 01:39:30.172
- Mr. Allnut made them.
- How very interesting.

01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:32.049
You don't believe me, do you?

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:35.218
Charlie, tell them
how you made the torpedoes.

01:39:36.471 --> 01:39:38.889
Well, I... See, what I did, I...

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:41.725
I took the heads off
two cylinders of oxygen

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.310
and I filled them up with live explosive.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:45.479
You know, about two hundredweight.
That was easy enough.

01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:47.481
It was the detonators
that took some doing.

01:39:47.565 --> 01:39:49.274
And you know what I used?

01:39:49.359 --> 01:39:52.319
Cartridges and nails
and blocks of soft wood.

01:39:52.403 --> 01:39:55.197
Then I took the two cylinders
and I put them in the bows

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:57.658
of the African Queen,
right down near the waterline,

01:39:57.742 --> 01:39:59.951
so when we rammed you...

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:01.662
And where is the African Queen?

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:03.664
She sank in the storm.

01:40:03.748 --> 01:40:05.332
But how did you get onto the lake?

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:09.544
We came down the Ulanga,
the Bora, you call it down here.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:12.798
- That's impossible.
- Nevertheless.

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:15.384
But everyone knows
the river is unnavigable.

01:40:15.468 --> 01:40:16.843
That may be.

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:19.096
We came down it, though,
didn't we, Charlie?

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.181
And in the African Queen.

01:41:01.639 --> 01:41:04.266
Would you hang us together, please?

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:08.478
- Now, wait a minute. Hey, Captain.
- Yes?

01:41:10.148 --> 01:41:13.442
- Will you grant us a last request?
- What is it?

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.486
- Marry us.
- What?

01:41:19.157 --> 01:41:22.826
We want to get married.
Ship captains can do that, can't they?

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:27.205
- Yeah.
- Why, Charlie, what a lovely idea.

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:29.750
What kind of craziness is this?

01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:32.961
Come on, Captain,
it'll only take a minute,

01:41:33.045 --> 01:41:35.589
and it'll mean such a lot to the lady.

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:38.383
Very well, if you wish it absolutely.

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.558
What are the names again?

01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:51.104
- Charles.
- Rosie. Rose.

01:41:52.023 --> 01:41:56.026
Do you, Charles, take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

01:41:57.195 --> 01:41:58.445
Yes, sir.

01:41:58.905 --> 01:42:03.074
Do you, Rose, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:04.409
I do.

01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:12.292
By the authority vested in me
by Kaiser Wilhelm II,

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:16.046
I pronounce you man and wife.
Proceed with the execution.

01:43:35.001 --> 01:43:36.376
Hey, what happened?

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.879
We did it, Charlie! We did it!

01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:40.213
But how?

01:43:44.552 --> 01:43:46.636
Well, what do you think?

01:43:48.514 --> 01:43:50.307
You all right, Mrs. Allnut?

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:54.227
Wonderful. Simply wonderful.
And you, Mr. Allnut?
