free time and with
our very limited budget,

00:27.569 --> 00:30.320
we went and got a nanny,
and then we went
out and took a class

on a very outmoded
and very unnecessary
form of communication

talk about you
in front of you.

what we did.

against the leg of his desk.

Yes, l did.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.014
You should talk
in a higher voice

19:43.098 --> 19:44.682
'cause the camera
makes you sound weird.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.725
Higher, okay?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.269
Recently certain events
have come to my attention...

19:48.395 --> 19:49.353
Higher.

19:49.438 --> 19:53.065

20:08.624 --> 20:10.541
Blowing the roof off!

20:11.752 --> 20:13.711

20:13.921 --> 20:16.505
This is my partner,
Darryl Philbin.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.050

through this entire thing.

20:19.134 --> 20:21.427

20:21.803 --> 20:24.138
Things get real.

Stay in my room,

20:27.768 --> 20:30.978

20:31.480 --> 20:34.649

20:38.153 --> 20:39.695
Wait, what do you mean?
The other man.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.322

Who is it?

20:41.865 --> 20:44.283

20:47.162 --> 20:48.913

20:51.291 --> 20:53.417
Okay, everybody,
let's take this next hill !

20:53.502 --> 20:56.462
Excuse me. Yeah,
I'd appreciate it if
you'd just let me run this.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.589
You know what?
You had your chance,
you're no leader.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.675
Up, out of your seat!
Let's blast!
Don't Iisten to him.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.552
We're approaching
a cool-down,
down a gentle hill.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.305
No! The hill's a trap.
Let's take the dirt
road off to the side.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.224
No, guys, no.
We're just cooling down.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.226
lf they catch us,
they will rape us.

21:10.310 --> 21:14.272
Go for the cliff.
And three, two, one, jump!

21:14.439 --> 21:17.566
No! You're dead,
you're dead, you're dead.
Good jump.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.112
You're barely alive.
Okay, now, nice cool-down.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.196
Check your pulse rate.
