Get out.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.302
We need the cell.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.499
You know him?

03:58.542 --> 04:01.023
He's one that watches
the Guardians.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.372
I mean,
the walkers.

04:02.416 --> 04:06.071
So he knows
where your mother's horde is?

04:06.115 --> 04:08.160
Probably.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.207
You've put us all at risk.We have to find that horde

04:11.251 --> 04:13.209
before it shows up
at our gates.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.819
So you decide for all of us?

04:14.863 --> 04:16.256
Knowing what it could mean?

04:16.299 --> 04:17.648
Doesn't matter anymore.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.391
We still gotta find them.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.875
I'm gonna be
in there with you,

04:26.918 --> 04:29.094
and Siddiq is gonna treat
his wounds first.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.444
He bleeds
until he answers.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.403
That's not your call.
None of this is.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.752
You did what you did,

04:34.796 --> 04:36.493
but I'm not gonna let it go
from bad to worse,

04:36.537 --> 04:38.234
and I think the council
would agree.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.192
Including Michonne.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.375
Come on.
You can stay with me.

04:57.079 --> 05:00.256
You can go on up.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.391
Thanks for having my back
with Gabriel.

05:04.434 --> 05:07.394
It's just the truth.

05:07.437 --> 05:10.179
The Whisperer's not gonnagive it up easy.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.181
If you wanna sit this out,I get it.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.638
Whoa-ho-ho!

05:34.682 --> 05:36.379
Down, boy.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.036
Yeah, good boy.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.086
Come on.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
It's still yours.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.333
This'll help
with the bruises.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.900
I had worse.

06:18.943 --> 06:21.685
Me, too.

06:23.774 --> 06:27.125
The Whisperer, what else
do you know about him?

06:27.169 --> 06:29.476
Only thathe won't betray my mom.

06:29.519 --> 06:33.131
The ones that watch the horde
are loyal.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.612
She gives them
no choice.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.875
Neither will I.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.616
What else?

06:40.661 --> 06:43.577
People will die,
right?

06:45.361 --> 06:48.756
I hate them.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.890
But I know them, too.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.024
Alpha drew a line,

06:56.067 --> 06:58.940
and you need to choose
which side you're on.

07:01.595 --> 07:04.119
I wish I'd left with Henrywhen he asked.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.474
So do I.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.870
My mom twists people.

07:18.568 --> 07:22.529
Gets them to do
what she wants.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.662
Makes them thinkit's what they want.

07:25.706 --> 07:29.927
People obey 'cause they thinkthey have no other choice.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.891
But if
you let him see...

07:36.934 --> 07:39.546
what you have here,

07:39.589 --> 07:46.596
that a place like thiscan survive...

07:46.640 --> 07:51.296
An idea like that
is dangerous.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.821
It would spread.

07:59.783 --> 08:03.831
And there's nothing
my mom could do to stop it.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.457
Don't try anything.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.938
Never.

08:29.247 --> 08:32.033
He's gonna
need stitches.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.862
I know you.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.649
Look.

08:45.699 --> 08:49.485
Dante can take it
from here.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.269
I'm fine.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.010
I'm fine.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.664
Outside.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.361
Now.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.433
Look.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.858
You have bread
every day.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.643
Yeah.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.733
Made fresh this morning.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.823
Got some extra,
if you'd like.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.133
How do your people
make so much?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.569
With flour.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.572
But...every day?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.749
Seems like a lot of peopledoing just that.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.665
As many as needed.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.761
Oh.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.721
From my daughter.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.205
You have children?

10:41.249 --> 10:42.859
Just the one.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.601
About all I can handle.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.690
And there are more?

10:49.213 --> 10:51.607
There are.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.001
Do you...?

10:54.044 --> 10:56.394
Children hold you back.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.744
Make you weak.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.616
What about a family,
then?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.271
Brothers or sisters?

11:09.233 --> 11:11.409
I'm an only child.

11:30.646 --> 11:33.736
Let's get started.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.835
So,
what's it gonna be?

11:45.879 --> 11:48.055
Honey or jam?

11:48.098 --> 11:51.972
Strawberry or apple?

11:57.281 --> 11:59.806
All of it.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.330
Not a problem.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.334
We have plenty here.

12:11.905 --> 12:16.953
For lunch,
I was thinking salted fish.

12:18.302 --> 12:22.480
I like to wrap 'em up
in a fresh piece of lettuce,

12:22.524 --> 12:24.091
add a little --

12:24.134 --> 12:26.571
What do you want?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.400
Well, right now,
we're just gonna talk.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.055
Pass.

12:32.099 --> 12:35.145
Okay.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.934
Then, eat.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.801
Good?

13:31.114 --> 13:33.769
No.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.907
You okay?

13:40.950 --> 13:43.648
Yeah.

13:43.692 --> 13:46.086
Am I okay?

13:46.129 --> 13:47.000
Yep.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.045
Nice and pasty.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.744
Still look good,
though.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.094
Damn right.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.574
I mean,
if it weren't for Gabriel,

13:56.618 --> 13:58.881
I would be
making my move.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.927
Don't let that
stop you.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.668
Man doesn't havea jealous bone in him.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.845
Oh, yeah?

14:05.888 --> 14:07.803
Okay,
scoot over.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.208
I've been thinking...

14:21.251 --> 14:22.600
Mm-hmm.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.994
...about Eugene.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.823
Sorry.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.218
It's your other
other man.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.263
Yeah.

14:33.307 --> 14:37.006
We set a date to talk,and I missed it.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.617
I justdon't want him to think

14:39.661 --> 14:41.881
that I was dissing him
or anything.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.972
He'll be fine.

14:46.015 --> 14:51.847
That guy,
he bounces back.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.937
Not everybody does.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.594
I did, uh, check out
a few of his baby tips.

14:59.637 --> 15:03.859
The poop chart --
that shit was on point.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.992
I mean, literally.

15:06.035 --> 15:09.430
Eugene is
a bona fide shit-ologist.

15:14.043 --> 15:18.047
We have a kid together,
Mami.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.920
Yes, we do.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.838
I didn't think I'd be a mamiin this world.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.971
Try not
to think about it.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.582
Freaks me out
every time.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.454
I just...

15:33.497 --> 15:35.978
wanna do it right.

15:36.022 --> 15:39.112
Wanna be a good dad.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.638
Freaks me outthat you're a dad, too.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.685
Thanks.

15:49.035 --> 15:53.474
No,she's lucky to have you.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.693
We both are.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.314
Here, sit up, sit up.

16:17.541 --> 16:20.196
Okay?
Yeah.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.725
You okay?

16:27.769 --> 16:30.032
Yeah.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.339
Just got
a lot of patients to see

16:32.382 --> 16:35.951
and miles to go
before I sleep.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.909
Okay, come on.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.488
Where's the horde?

17:03.196 --> 17:05.285
Tell me.

17:05.328 --> 17:09.985
Lady,you have the animal in you.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.206
If we were out there,

17:13.249 --> 17:16.992
I would take youlike a bitch in heat.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.359
Unh!

17:47.153 --> 17:50.330
That's enough.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.035
You're all weak.

18:08.174 --> 18:12.265
Gonna start
with your fingers first.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.180
Then both your ears.

18:14.223 --> 18:17.183
Then we'll take
all your teeth.

18:17.226 --> 18:20.360
You lie to yourselves.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.452
To each other.

18:25.495 --> 18:28.411
You fight for what?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.196
Sandwiches?

18:32.198 --> 18:35.201
You ignore the truth

18:35.244 --> 18:39.683
when it's staring youin the face.

18:39.727 --> 18:43.252
I would never
betray Alpha.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.385
She rescued me.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.648
She protects me.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.172
She loves me.

18:50.216 --> 18:53.262
She loves us all.

18:53.306 --> 18:58.267
She sacrificedher own daughter for us.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.490
She killed Lydia?

19:03.533 --> 19:04.882
Oh.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.671
She did.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.891
And I am willing

19:13.935 --> 19:17.068
to give my life
for her.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.558
Stop.

19:28.602 --> 19:31.126
This ends now.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.389
You're not getting Lydia
mixed up in this.

19:33.433 --> 19:36.131
He swallowed every ounceof Alpha's bullshit.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.437
Every ounce.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.048
If he seesthat Lydia's alive and well,

19:40.091 --> 19:42.355
gets it that his great leader
lied to him,

19:42.398 --> 19:45.140
then maybe
that changes something.Please.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.534
That kid's
been through enough.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.321
Let hermake up her own mind.

19:52.365 --> 19:55.194
This is the only way,
and you know it.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.680
That good, huh?

20:03.724 --> 20:07.206
It's a little better
than last time, yeah.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.950
Know how I know
a man's lying?

20:12.994 --> 20:15.692
His lips are moving.

20:17.390 --> 20:21.176
Cheryl,
you're gonna get through this.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.743
Okay?

20:22.786 --> 20:25.963
I'll make sure of it.

20:26.007 --> 20:29.271
Sit down, Doc.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.500
You look
worse than I do.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.459
Close your peepers.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.113
Rest.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.376
Cheryl,
I can't -- I --

20:47.420 --> 20:49.204
Ain't for me.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.599
I made my peace.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.384
But others...

20:55.428 --> 20:59.910
need to haveyour head on straight.

21:21.671 --> 21:24.631
Go ahead.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.504
Yeah.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.775
She's actually
a pretty good rider.

21:38.819 --> 21:42.039
Mostly I think she just
uses it as an excuse

21:42.083 --> 21:44.825
to stay out
with her friends.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.696
Did you ever ride?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.524
Sometimes.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.047
Yeah,
I couldn't get enough.

21:50.091 --> 21:53.181
Find every excuseto stay out as long as I could,

21:53.224 --> 21:56.619
keep going, even if it was just
up and down our street.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.404
As kids,
we'd always try

21:58.447 --> 22:01.320
to take the long way homearound the lake.

22:05.715 --> 22:08.370
Brother or sister?

22:10.503 --> 22:13.680
I'm sorry.
I...

22:13.723 --> 22:16.030
I had a brother.

22:16.073 --> 22:19.686
Yeah, he was a couple years
younger than me.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.122
He, uh...

22:22.602 --> 22:24.473
He loved cars.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.476
Only thing he loved
more than cars was people.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.524
And...they loved him.

22:31.567 --> 22:35.571
And I still think about him
every day.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.313
You know,
I know what it's like

22:38.357 --> 22:39.793
to lose someone
that you love that much,

22:39.836 --> 22:43.318
and I know that it helps
to talk about it.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.494
What you're doing...

22:45.538 --> 22:47.540
these questions...

22:47.583 --> 22:51.413
you know,
digging for intel...

22:53.676 --> 22:55.461
I suppose I should be
doing the same,

22:55.504 --> 22:57.506
but what's the point?

22:58.942 --> 23:01.684
So maybe we just...

23:01.728 --> 23:05.862
talk about nothing
worth reporting, you know?

23:05.906 --> 23:08.430
You know, I can go on and on
about my brother,

23:08.474 --> 23:10.171
and maybe you can --

23:12.434 --> 23:14.567
We walk in darkness,we are free.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.004
We bathe in blood,
we are free...

23:17.047 --> 23:19.441
Whisperer: We walk in darkness,we are free.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.182
We bathe in blood,
we are free...

23:21.225 --> 23:22.531
Gabriel:
I don't know.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.533
We came back,
and he was shaking in pain.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.407
We walk in darkness...

23:28.450 --> 23:30.800
Put your healin' hands on me,
Doc.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.236
I'm burning up here.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.499
What's the problem?

23:33.542 --> 23:34.935
How the hell
should I know?!

23:34.978 --> 23:37.633
Just make it stop!

23:37.677 --> 23:39.461
I'm on this,
Jefe.
No. Come on.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.507
All right,
his breathing's labored.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.639
Pupils dilated,
his muscles are convulsing,

23:43.683 --> 23:45.032
but no signs
of infection.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.381
It doesn't make sense.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.470
Hey, hey!
Easy!

23:48.514 --> 23:50.820
Hold him!

23:50.864 --> 23:54.563
Look, Dante, in my bag,grab the red bark!

23:54.607 --> 23:57.044
Red bark!

23:57.087 --> 23:59.568
Easy.
Hey, hey, easy.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.178
Easy, easy.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.615
Hey.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.666
No, Carol.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.377
This morning...

24:26.421 --> 24:28.423
Did you
give this to him?

24:28.467 --> 24:31.600
Yeah,
for pain and inflammation.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.429
You killed him.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.129
How?

24:40.348 --> 24:42.437
No, that's yarrow.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.919
It's hemlock.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.443
I -- I didn't know.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.966
I -- I didn't know.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.315
I thought, uh --

24:51.359 --> 24:54.188
What?
You thought what?

24:54.231 --> 24:57.321
I never thought hemlock would bein the bag because, um...

24:57.365 --> 24:59.410
Because what,
Dante?

25:02.065 --> 25:04.677
Because you packed it.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.156
One less Guardian
for our horde.

25:56.816 --> 26:00.776
The man
with the metal arm?

26:00.820 --> 26:03.300
Aaron.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.608
He has a daughter.

26:06.652 --> 26:09.742
Is that
all you've learned?

26:12.745 --> 26:15.530
Did you ask...

26:15.574 --> 26:18.315
after your sister's child?

26:18.359 --> 26:21.536
There is nothing
to ask.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.756
He is one of them.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.933
He will slaughter
our kind.

26:26.976 --> 26:30.850
He will search out
your weaknesses.

26:30.893 --> 26:34.244
He will use your sisteragainst you.

26:36.769 --> 26:40.250
Remove your mask.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.541
We are always
being tested.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.459
We must remain strong.

27:26.993 --> 27:30.779
I believe in you.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.390
Never doubt that.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.963
You are my Gamma.

27:42.312 --> 27:45.402
Tell me.

27:45.446 --> 27:48.754
This Aaron...

27:48.797 --> 27:54.194
he tempts you
with his lies.

27:54.237 --> 27:57.066
Do not be seduced.

28:06.989 --> 28:11.037
Gabriel: If people find out,they'll panic.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.214
If Alpha finds out...

28:14.257 --> 28:16.912
She won't.

28:19.262 --> 28:22.222
I'll clean up
the mess.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.832
I'll help.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.792
'Cause it's not your messto clean.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.495
Lydia: We're not going hunting,are we?

28:34.538 --> 28:37.237
You still wanna help?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.673
Yeah.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.631
Good.

28:42.155 --> 28:45.462
Cheryl?

29:12.054 --> 29:14.883
Hey.

29:19.888 --> 29:24.719
I was gonna come try to find youbut, uh...

29:53.400 --> 29:55.881
Siddiq: Cheryl, you're gonna get through this.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.839
It's hemlock. I'll make sure of it.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.493
You killed him.

30:39.315 --> 30:42.362
Open your eyes.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.191
Look.

30:51.066 --> 30:54.069
Look.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.158
Enid!

31:26.667 --> 31:29.888
I heard
what happened.

31:30.758 --> 31:34.022
Don't want
to talk about it.

31:34.066 --> 31:37.025
Go home.
You should be in bed.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.941
No.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.857
Start
or we go back in.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.033
Drown together.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.993
There's nothing to say.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.343
He died
because of my --

31:50.386 --> 31:51.605
Unh-unh.

31:51.648 --> 31:54.608
No,I want the real shit.

31:54.651 --> 31:58.438
Whatever's been eating you up
for weeks -- spill.

32:04.226 --> 32:07.664
It's like
I'm still there...

32:07.708 --> 32:08.970
all the time.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.885
It's like
I never left.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.974
But it's just pieces.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.063
And they're all
jumbled together

32:15.107 --> 32:18.284
like a puzzle
or something.

32:18.327 --> 32:21.678
The screams and...

32:21.722 --> 32:23.985
the smell...

32:24.029 --> 32:26.901
the blood,
everything...

32:30.078 --> 32:32.776
I can't get it
to stop.

32:32.820 --> 32:36.215
People are dying.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.217
Cheryl is already --

32:38.260 --> 32:39.914
Cheryl was sick.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.656
You're doing
everything you can.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.398
You're not alone.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.924
You mean Dante?

32:52.971 --> 32:58.933
Do you know why
he bothers me so much?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.415
Enid.

33:05.548 --> 33:08.464
'Cause when he's there...

33:08.508 --> 33:12.033
I just think about
how much I miss her.

33:13.556 --> 33:16.472
But then, I get to remember
how I failed her, so...

33:17.778 --> 33:20.085
No.

33:20.128 --> 33:23.305
No,this isn't your fault.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.266
What that skin bitch didain't on you.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.355
You weren't there.

33:30.704 --> 33:33.359
Okay? You...

33:35.578 --> 33:38.364
Enid, Tara, the...

33:42.107 --> 33:46.154
People that I love
died right in front of me.

33:46.198 --> 33:51.072
And now I get to watch it
over and over and over.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.248
And I did nothing.

33:54.554 --> 33:55.772
I did nothing!

33:55.816 --> 33:59.776
I just --
I didn't move.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.388
I didn't help.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.392
I just watched.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.265
Now, because of me,
more people...

34:10.309 --> 34:12.963
Look, I'm just --
I'm not smart enough.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.488
Bullshit.

34:15.531 --> 34:18.926
Bullshit.

34:18.969 --> 34:22.190
You have to
pull through.

34:23.626 --> 34:25.846
You have to fight it.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.501
For Coco.

34:28.544 --> 34:30.024
Me.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.506
And everyone else
that loves you.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.769
And you can.

34:35.812 --> 34:37.597
You will.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.557
Because you're not alone.

34:41.601 --> 34:44.734
And you're the smartest personI know.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.608
Except me, of course.

34:57.269 --> 35:00.446
I still can't figure out
why you're sick.

35:05.059 --> 35:08.715
The patients,
you don't live together,

35:08.758 --> 35:10.064
you don't work together,

35:10.108 --> 35:13.198
you don't even eat
the same things.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.984
There's not
a common denominator.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.334
At least not one
that I can...

35:19.378 --> 35:22.337
What?

35:22.381 --> 35:23.599
Nothing.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.471
Go home, okay?

35:25.514 --> 35:27.647
Go home.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.038
Yaah!

36:12.561 --> 36:15.347
Yaah!

36:25.487 --> 36:27.402
No, no.
It's --

36:27.446 --> 36:30.492
That's yours now.
A gift.

36:30.536 --> 36:33.278
I don't want anythingfrom you.

36:33.321 --> 36:36.803
Take it
or I'll burn it.

36:46.813 --> 36:49.250
All right.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.296
No more games.

36:51.339 --> 36:55.604
I ask questions,and you answer, got it?

36:55.648 --> 36:57.171
Don't do this.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.825
This isn't you.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.957
You...

37:01.001 --> 37:04.396
have no idea
who I am.

37:04.439 --> 37:07.616
Now, how many peopledo you have?

37:10.706 --> 37:13.405
Let him go.

37:13.448 --> 37:14.667
Let him go.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.461
No.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.071
No.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.598
No.

37:41.433 --> 37:44.305
Your mother told her people
that she killed you.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.095
You said
you wanted my help.

37:52.139 --> 37:54.228
I did.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.100
You used me.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.885
Lydia, I'm sorry.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.278
You're just like her.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.890
Lydia...

38:07.459 --> 38:10.288
You said you wanted me
to choose a side?

38:10.331 --> 38:11.332
I choose mine.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.552
You can't go out there.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.423
It's too dangerous.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.514
You can't stop me.

38:22.343 --> 38:25.651
Unh! Aah.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.656
Aaron: Wait.

38:30.699 --> 38:33.659
They could be watching.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.018
Dante: Hey.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.325
I know it's late,
but I saw the light on --

39:31.369 --> 39:33.806
Leave me alone.

39:35.155 --> 39:38.506
Just wanna chat
for sec, Jef.

39:38.550 --> 39:41.596
I am not your jef.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.861
Sure you are, Chief.

39:47.559 --> 39:50.344
Mm.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.478
I'll go, but...

39:53.521 --> 39:57.090
not before
saying sorry.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.484
With Eugene gone,
I gotta...

39:59.527 --> 40:02.443
pitch in
with the water.

40:03.575 --> 40:05.011
I haven't
pulled my weight.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.926
Stop.

40:06.969 --> 40:10.016
Stop.
This is my fault.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.019
It's not yours.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.543
It is not
anyone else's.

40:15.587 --> 40:17.371
Yeah.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.418
I know
you want this blame.

40:21.767 --> 40:27.120
For a sec, everything else
makes sense, right?

40:27.163 --> 40:31.037
Well, I'm sorry, bro --
ain't how it works.

40:32.560 --> 40:36.259
Look,
this place is special.

40:36.303 --> 40:39.480
And I got that
right away.

40:39.524 --> 40:44.137
It -- It works
'cause it's a village.

40:44.180 --> 40:49.925
It takes everyone here
to build, grow, and fight,

40:49.969 --> 40:56.192
raise rug rats
and heal people.

40:56.236 --> 40:59.413
Everyone carries
equal weight.

41:03.199 --> 41:08.204
So, when something happens,
it's all our fault, yeah?

41:10.772 --> 41:15.124
And when one of us
is suffering...

41:15.168 --> 41:17.475
we're here to help.

41:17.518 --> 41:21.000
You don't even
know me, man.

41:23.045 --> 41:26.005
Sure do.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.747
You're my friend.

41:36.929 --> 41:40.019
It's gonna be okay.

41:40.062 --> 41:43.239
Yeah.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.893
Yeah.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.036
Look.

42:04.739 --> 42:08.134
Enid!

42:08.177 --> 42:10.397
Look.

42:12.094 --> 42:14.488
Open your eyes.

42:16.011 --> 42:17.970
N-o-o-o!

42:18.013 --> 42:20.799
Open your eyes.

43:03.102 --> 43:05.931
Get off!

43:14.592 --> 43:17.116
I didn't want this!

43:17.159 --> 43:18.639
Not you!

43:18.683 --> 43:20.902
Not like this.

43:32.522 --> 43:35.351
Close your eyes.

43:35.395 --> 43:37.745
Close your eyes.
