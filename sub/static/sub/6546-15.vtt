WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.538
- Previously on Haven.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.581
- Mara's gone for good.

00:04.714 --> 00:07.205
- It's just Audrey now.
- It's me!

00:07.341 --> 00:09.206
- Mara got the last laugh.
She messed with Duke,

00:09.343 --> 00:10.879
turned him into some kind of bomb.

00:12.555 --> 00:13.886
infected people.
- Ow!

00:14.015 --> 00:15.221
- Ah!
- Oh!

00:15.349 --> 00:17.135
- This fog around town
must be someone's Trouble.

00:17.268 --> 00:20.385
No one can get through.
- This mightjust be the beginning.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.228
- Dave's vision led us here, to this.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.393
- His Trouble is what created this barrier.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.938
- We're all trapped in Haven,
with a killer.

00:28.070 --> 00:31.107
- Duke, we can't do it without you.
- I'm sorry, Audrey.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.488
- Duke!

00:36.621 --> 00:38.202
So that's it? No way out?

00:39.373 --> 00:42.080
- This is Dwight Hendrickson.
Haven as we knew it...

00:42.210 --> 00:44.997
is gone.
The Guard will protect you.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.414
The Troubles are real.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.248
- You come from Haven?
Haven, it's the town right behind us,

00:50.384 --> 00:53.626
you couldn't have missed it.
- I never heard of any Haven.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.599
(indistinct chatter)

01:05.316 --> 01:07.147
(Audrey): We'll be heading inside shortly.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.982
If you know your Trouble,

01:09.111 --> 01:12.103
it would be helpful if you could
tell the men at the door.

01:12.823 --> 01:15.485
- Easy, one at a time.

01:15.618 --> 01:18.985
There's enough for every guest
at Hotel Elementary School.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.622
(blows whistle)

01:20.748 --> 01:23.581
- All right, you heard him.
Form up, single file.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.701
We're conserving power, so you each get
a flashlight and three batteries.

01:26.837 --> 01:30.000
Use them wisely. I don't need to tell you
you want them to last.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.748
This new Trouble kills
in complete darkness.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.423
- Easy on the batteries. lt's three each.
There's enough for everyone. Put them back.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.386
- So we lost power in the northwest block?

01:38.516 --> 01:40.552
- Yeah, but I think that
we've got everybody out.

01:40.685 --> 01:41.891
- Any problems?

01:42.728 --> 01:44.719
- Well, there's been a couple fights,

01:44.855 --> 01:49.189
and after two weeks of nonstop Troubles,
I think everybody's starting to lose it.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.058
Hell, l'm barely holding it together.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.526
- It's not showing.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.691
These people will be thanking
you when night falls.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.156
- I guess we need to keep 'em
here to keep 'em safe,

01:57.285 --> 02:00.322
but I just worry that it's only
gonna go from bad to worse.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.780
- Right now, I think it's the best way
to keep people alive.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.623
- Here, let me help you with that.

02:06.752 --> 02:07.912
Okay?

02:08.045 --> 02:09.581
I got it. Yeah.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.875
Okay, do you need water? It's right there.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.388
- Give me some good news.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.472
- Wish I could.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.102
Talked to the group at the docks.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.389
They have no idea who's
causing the darkness Trouble.

02:26.522 --> 02:29.264
- And the Crocker Journal?
- A mention, nothing useful.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.437
- That means the Trouble came from Duke.
He'd be immune if he was here.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.151
- He's not here.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.613
I'm gonna grab Audrey,
search another part of town.

02:37.742 --> 02:40.734
- Ah, I gotta advise against that, man.

02:40.870 --> 02:43.111
Nightfall's coming.
Power in town's been spotty.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.580
Besides, it's not what hides in the dark
we need to worry about.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.951
- Yeah, it's the dark itself.
- Yeah.

02:50.087 --> 02:53.295
Listen, you and Audrey are
pros at solving Troubles.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.630
You'll figure this one out.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.465
- I hope so.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.586
Still haven't figured out
how to bring down that fog wall yet.

03:01.057 --> 03:04.174
- Maybe that's a blessing.
Keep this chaos contained to Haven.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.978
(woman): Hey, put those back.
You can't take more than three batteries.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.937
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

03:11.067 --> 03:12.147
Put those back! Hey!

03:12.276 --> 03:13.607
Come back here with those!

03:13.736 --> 03:15.692
- Matter of time till somebody tried that.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.482
You take the other guy.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.276
Hey!

03:30.628 --> 03:31.788
- Hey!

03:39.136 --> 03:41.001
- I didn't do anything.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.218
- Don't move.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.714
There's not enough light in here.
Come on up, man.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.007
Hey, hey!

03:49.855 --> 03:52.847
Listen to me, we gotta get you out of here.
You'll die if you...

03:52.983 --> 03:55.110
(screams)

04:00.574 --> 04:02.235
...go into the dark.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.036
(somber folk music)

04:34.608 --> 04:34.642
(mellow rock music)

04:34.650 --> 04:37.517
(mellow rock music)

04:41.532 --> 04:43.898
(man on radio): That was the latest
from ln-F/ight Safety.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.117
Well, it looks like we ’re going to have
more nice weather in Halifax today.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.071
- Morning, sir.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.493
- Hey, Crocker.
- Yeah?

04:52.626 --> 04:55.413
- Listen, I'm happy to pay
you under the table,

04:55.546 --> 04:59.038
but what has me a little worried
is why I can't find any information on you.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.962
- Do you care? Right?

05:09.101 --> 05:10.637
- I do if you're a terrorist.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.019
- Well, I'm not.
- Okay, so what are you?

05:14.148 --> 05:16.981
I mean, you're not the usual
ex-con grease monkey on the lam.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.610
I mean, I like them as employees.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.021
Zero attitude.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.440
But I can't find your rap sheet anywhere.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.529
You have bigger problems, don't you?

05:26.577 --> 05:27.657
Why are you working here?

05:27.786 --> 05:31.153
- You know, I just wanted a job
where I could work with my hands.

05:32.374 --> 05:36.413
Turn a wrench, fix things. That's it.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.125
(whistles)

05:40.257 --> 05:42.043
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna...

05:42.176 --> 05:44.167
- You're off fixing now.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.418
(tools clatter)

05:48.390 --> 05:51.598
Go muck out those three bays,
and we'll see if you have a job tomorrow.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.434
- Okeydokey.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.145
(sighs)

06:03.447 --> 06:06.063
(dialing)

06:06.200 --> 06:08.907
(line rings)

06:09.036 --> 06:14.576
Hey, Monty, it's Duke Crocker here.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.825
Listen, I'm in your neck
of the woods, and...

06:17.962 --> 06:22.001
as it turns out, I may need a new job.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.966
You know, something
outdoors, simple, legal.

06:27.471 --> 06:31.305
Thing is, uh, I'm not hustling anymore.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.675
Trying to simplify my life for a while,
if you know what I mean.

06:34.812 --> 06:39.647
Anyways, call me. Thanks.

06:41.986 --> 06:45.023
- ljust got a Trouble, harmless, I hope.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.861
My skin becomes reflective.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.027
- Any clue what triggers it?

06:49.159 --> 06:50.774
- Vanity.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.493
lt's under control,
but I'd love another pillow

06:53.622 --> 06:54.998
for my beauty sleep.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.035
- Sure.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.166
Here you go.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.261
- You helping out?

07:12.391 --> 07:16.259
- Trying. No shortage of things to do.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.852
- Especially when you're
stuck here with no ticket home.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.851
- How long?

07:24.445 --> 07:25.901
- I don't know.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.567
- Do you realize how hard this is?

07:28.699 --> 07:31.736
- What are you gonna do,
turn me into someone else?

07:31.869 --> 07:34.906
- No, I would never do that.
I'm trying to fix things.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.155
- Try to fix the Troubles.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.031
- We've already talked about this.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.126
It's almost impossible to remove a Trouble
without killing someone.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.790
- "Almost" is not absolute.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.662
You have been on this for two weeks.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.414
You must have figured something out.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.382
- Sure, ljust need tools I don't have,

07:49.511 --> 07:51.172
materials that are impossible to get,

07:51.305 --> 07:53.637
and knowledge that might not exist.

07:53.766 --> 07:56.257
- You wouldn't be this
frustrated if you didn't think

07:56.393 --> 07:58.930
maybe you could do it.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.652
- This Club Med looked way better
in the brochure.

08:08.781 --> 08:12.444
- Oh, come on, you don't like the view?

08:14.370 --> 08:16.907
- I like the view.

08:27.716 --> 08:28.922
- Good day at work?

08:29.051 --> 08:30.666
- Yeah.

08:30.803 --> 08:33.294
Ran into the poltergeist Trouble.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.422
Got trapped in a souvenir store.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.263
- Hey, Nathan, Dwight wants you.

08:40.396 --> 08:41.977
- Thanks, Tony.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.893
- What did you do now?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.609
- I think it's about that thief we caught.
Dwight's pissed.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.146
- Okay, yeah.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.534
(electricity crackles)

08:54.660 --> 08:56.525
If we lose power...

08:56.662 --> 08:58.277
- We're all done for.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.165
- Darkness kills.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.159
We need to repair the power plant,

09:06.296 --> 09:09.003
get it back to 100%.

09:09.133 --> 09:11.419
- That's no easy trip.
The plant's across town,

09:11.552 --> 09:14.464
and the number of Troubles
between here and there, it's...

09:15.264 --> 09:16.674
Who's the hero?

09:21.145 --> 09:22.055
Me?

09:23.147 --> 09:24.512
- You're the best we got.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.764
You've been through Trouble alley.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.640
You're the only person who could come back.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.195
- Gonna need a team.
- You got it.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.156
- Sure we're going about this the right way?
- What do you mean?

09:36.285 --> 09:40.073
- We get the power plant working,
sure we got light, but it's just a Band-Aid.

09:40.205 --> 09:43.038
We need to stop this darkness Trouble
and then the rest of them...

09:43.167 --> 09:44.703
- I got to keep people alive.

09:44.835 --> 09:48.168
That's job one,
and I'll do whatever I have to.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.582
- Okay.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.040
Just hope we can keep
everybody under control.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.838
- I'm not relying on hope.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.106
- Any idea what's going on?

10:09.234 --> 10:11.225
- Nope.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.577
- I know these last two weeks
have been rough,

10:22.706 --> 10:25.288
and I'm sure no one enjoyed
leaving their homes,

10:25.417 --> 10:27.908
but every time this town has
been tossed a new challenge,

10:28.045 --> 10:31.253
we've defeated it, when we work together.

10:31.381 --> 10:35.249
However, there's a bad element.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.420
(grunts)

10:36.553 --> 10:38.635
- Let me go!

10:38.764 --> 10:41.927
- Individuals who have
maliciously harmed us,

10:42.059 --> 10:44.926
stealing supplies, including
life-saving batteries...

10:45.062 --> 10:46.802
Well, no more.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.726
Either we pull together, or we fall apart.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.349
- Go ahead, Judge Judy.

10:52.486 --> 10:57.526
- For your repeated crimes against the group,
you will be banished at sunrise.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.195
The Guard will no longer assist you.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.903
- This is insane. They were batteries!

11:05.040 --> 11:07.452
- This is the only way to
keep the rest of us safe.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.165
- Come on, man!

11:09.294 --> 11:11.626
(crowd murmuring)

11:11.755 --> 11:15.623
- If they throw him out...
- The darkness Trouble will kill him.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.639
I'll be fine.
It's just a scenic walk to the power plant.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.433
- Down Trouble alley,
and cell phones don't work.

11:30.566 --> 11:33.979
And with the magnet Trouble
active, cars are risky too.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.773
- It's a good thing I got a crack team.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.396
An engineer to help repair the power plant.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.945
He volunteered
as soon as he found out.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.489
So did Kira Futcher, Tony’s ﬁancee.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.577
She’s plan B.
- Oh, that’s smart.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.915
You got your own Energizer bunny.
You can use her Trouble to power the plant

11:50.043 --> 11:51.954
in case things go sideways.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.502
Dave, I mean, I love him but...

11:54.631 --> 11:57.839
- He wanted to go says he's got blueprints
of the power plant at the Herald

11:57.968 --> 11:59.959
from a recent story they did on a retrofit.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.882
- What in the Sam Hill are you thinking?

12:03.015 --> 12:05.631
Why did you join Nathan's expedition?

12:05.767 --> 12:09.009
- Well, someone has to get him
those blueprints from the Herald.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.809
- A monkey can do that.
What's the real reason?

12:12.941 --> 12:15.023
- The no marks killer's out there.

12:15.152 --> 12:18.519
- And we haven't had a lead in two weeks.

12:18.655 --> 12:22.648
Why are you actually going, Dave?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.988
- Charlotte.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.156
She has answers.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.329
(Audrey): Charlotte... why is she going?

12:33.462 --> 12:35.748
- She's good at science.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.464
And I think, really,
she just wanted to prove to you

12:39.593 --> 12:41.049
she genuinely wants to help.

12:41.178 --> 12:44.545
- Okay, well, whatever the reason,
just keep an eye on her for me, okay?

12:44.681 --> 12:47.058
'Cause she and |, we're not
immune to these new Troubles.

12:47.184 --> 12:50.392
- Yeah, don't worry, I won't let
your mom become Trouble bait.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.057
- Well, it's not just about her being my mom.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.307
I think that she may have figured out
how to end all this.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.650
- She figured something out?

12:58.779 --> 13:01.361
- Maybe, but she's not talking about it.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.526
- Good to know.

13:03.659 --> 13:06.321
- While you're gone,
I'll just keep searching the school

13:06.453 --> 13:09.195
for the person with the darkness Trouble.
People have been coming in all day,

13:09.331 --> 13:10.741
so they could be here by now.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.785
(zips up bag)

13:14.544 --> 13:16.205
Hey, so this is it. Is it time?

13:16.338 --> 13:17.748
- Daylight's burning.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.837
- Just don't let the nighttime burn you.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.332
I need you back here.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.941
(Vince): He stole those batteries
and endangered us all.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.106
There was no other choice, Dwight.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.571
You did what you had to for these people,

13:44.700 --> 13:47.567
and hell, it was better
than just killing the thief.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.819
- Then why do | feel like I'm the criminal?

13:57.879 --> 14:01.371
(phone rings)

14:05.095 --> 14:07.552
- I'll be right there.

14:08.598 --> 14:13.217
- We found him after sunrise.
No marks on him, so we moved him here.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.854
- His eyes?

14:17.107 --> 14:19.393
- Like the others, stained black.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.313
- Then that's three in two weeks.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.858
- And now the serial killer
is in this building.

14:25.741 --> 14:29.484
- Dwight needs to know about this
but no one else.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.155
What's this guy's name?

14:31.288 --> 14:33.449
- Rolf Starr.

14:33.582 --> 14:34.947
- Hey.
- Hmm?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.994
- I don't know what kind of freak

14:37.127 --> 14:41.120
has this killer darkness thing,
but if you need somewhere safe...

14:43.592 --> 14:44.923
- Rain check?

14:49.264 --> 14:53.473
- Uh, I think my husband saw
who you're looking for.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.968
He watched a man walk out
of the dark unharmed.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.480
- Somebody immune to the darkness?

14:57.606 --> 14:58.641
Okay, great.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.685
Can I speak with your husband,
so I can get a description?

15:00.817 --> 15:03.854
- I wish. We got separated
on the move to the gym.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.478
Dwight's looking into it. We'll find him.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.981
- All right, well, I will go ahead
and talk to Dwight.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.233
Do you happen to have
a snapshot of your husband?

15:11.369 --> 15:12.324
-Oh, um...

15:14.915 --> 15:16.496
His name's Rolf.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.616
- Thank you.

15:23.799 --> 15:24.834
- Duke?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.002
- Who's asking?

15:31.139 --> 15:34.347
- l'm Hailie Colton.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.182
Monty's daughter. You left a voice mail.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.176
- Wow. Yeah, Hailie.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.897
You're all... grown up.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.435
- Yeah.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.900
- Where's your old man?

15:49.032 --> 15:51.318
- I don't know. Gone.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.239
Going legit didn't really work out for him,
so he split six months ago.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.074
- Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.664
- Yeah, me too.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.878
- You okay?

16:10.512 --> 16:13.675
- No, not really.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.266
When good old Monty split,

16:18.395 --> 16:21.387
he owed some money
to some not-so-nice people,

16:21.523 --> 16:24.139
so they're looking for me now.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.896
- How much you owe?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.024
-31K.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.740
Yeah, he bet on the Bills.
(chuckles)

16:33.869 --> 16:35.734
Idiot.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.953
- Come back later.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.744
I'll get you the money.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.335
- Thanks.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.420
My dad always said you were a good guy.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.215
- I'm trying.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.062
(Charlotte): Is that your ring?

17:14.743 --> 17:16.324
- It was my father's.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.577
We always assumed Lucy,
one of Mara's personalities,

17:19.706 --> 17:21.617
gave it to him.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.787
I know it matches
the pair you and Audrey have.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.411
- lt belonged to my husband.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.083
- Mara's father.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.672
What happened to him?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.836
- He passed a long time ago.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.051
Mara kept it as a memento.

17:37.724 --> 17:42.468
Thank you, but it's yours now.
Keep it safe.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.819
- So Audrey says you're working
on a way to end the Troubles

17:52.948 --> 17:54.779
without killing everyone.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.366
- There might be,
but if you ask me to explain it,

17:58.495 --> 18:02.488
it'll just seem all the more daunting,
so please don't.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.204
- Great.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.337
Now somebody's Banksy—ing up the place.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.674
- I'm the artist. Put that here last week.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.044
It's a warning: Once we cross that line,

18:17.180 --> 18:21.514
we have to go silent,
or we risk waking up a Trouble.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.059
- What kind of Trouble?

18:36.324 --> 18:39.407
So mouths shut. Walk quietly. Ready?

18:39.536 --> 18:42.152
Let's go.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.054
(clattering)

19:02.684 --> 19:05.175
- It's all good.

19:12.193 --> 19:15.731
(heavy footsteps)

19:15.864 --> 19:17.070
- Run!

19:17.198 --> 19:18.187
(Dave): Where?

19:18.325 --> 19:21.192
lt's invisible!

19:21.328 --> 19:22.363
(Nathan): Come on!

19:25.582 --> 19:29.245
(invisible beast roaring)

19:31.671 --> 19:33.582
Behind the car.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.297
(heavy footsteps continue)

19:36.426 --> 19:37.541
- Ah!

19:37.677 --> 19:39.178
My foot's stuck!

19:41.056 --> 19:42.421
Hurry! It's getting close!

19:42.557 --> 19:44.138
(beast roaring)

19:44.267 --> 19:47.259
- Don't worry.
(grunts)

19:47.395 --> 19:48.475
- It's coming!

19:49.397 --> 19:50.432
(beast roaring)

19:50.565 --> 19:52.647
- Nathan, it's aether.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.482
We need it to cure the Troubles.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.102
If something happens to me,
get Audrey as much as you can.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.900
(beast roaring)

20:07.540 --> 20:09.201
(beast roaring, heavy footsteps)

20:10.668 --> 20:13.796
(Dave): It's coming!
(grunts)

20:13.922 --> 20:16.584
(Nathan): Go!
(grunts)

20:18.134 --> 20:19.340
(gaSDS)
- Oh, jeez!

20:19.469 --> 20:22.677
(roaring and footsteps continue)

20:22.806 --> 20:25.343
Looks like we're not in Kansas anymore.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.431
(heavy footsteps recede)

20:29.437 --> 20:31.974
- What do you mean you can't find it?
You're a bank.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.940
You can't just misplace money.
(man): We don’t, sir,

20:35.068 --> 20:37.684
but we also don ’t even have
a branch in Haven, Maine,

20:37.821 --> 20:39.527
where you claim to have made the deposits.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.362
- Listen to me.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.028
l have got 400 grand in that account.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.869
- Moreover, I can ’t even ﬁnd
a "Haven, Maine, " on a map.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.784
- You're telling me you can't find
a town with 25,000 people?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.454
- Look, as far as we ’re concerned,

20:53.586 --> 20:56.373
Haven, Maine, like your money,
doesn ’t exist.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.497
I’m sorry, we can ’t help you.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.509
- This wasn't caused by Troubles.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.224
- Looters and vandals.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.561
Troubles aren't the only
problem in Haven now.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.523
Grab the blueprints,
then we'll push on to the plant.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.899
- Yeah, be back in two shakes.

21:25.368 --> 21:29.828
- Aether caused the Troubles.
It can end them too?

21:29.956 --> 21:34.575
- It's like uranium... powerful,
and if manipulated correctly,

21:34.711 --> 21:36.372
it could be our salvation.

21:37.881 --> 21:41.248
- Then why didn't we use aether
to end the Troubles from the start?

21:41.384 --> 21:44.751
- Because to do so we'd need a lot of aether,
more than I've ever seen.

21:44.888 --> 21:47.755
- You can't bring more in?
- Not with the thinnies sealed.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.553
- Then we need to find
the stash William left here.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.101
- William left a stash here?

21:54.230 --> 21:56.266
- Mara was looking for it.
She never found it.

21:56.399 --> 21:57.935
- Then how are we going to?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.728
- Maybe this could help.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.273
- Seth's rougarou detector.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.611
How do you have that?

22:03.740 --> 22:07.449
- Well, Gloria brought over a box of stuff
that Duke left at the Gull.

22:07.577 --> 22:10.114
My guess is he got a five-finger discount.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.740
- lt detects aether... if it's close enough.

22:14.876 --> 22:16.457
It could lead us to William's stash.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.248
- Nathan, don't get your hopes too high.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.793
I can't believe that William
had the amount I need, and...

22:22.926 --> 22:24.462
aether's just step one.

22:24.594 --> 22:27.176
We need to get to the power plant.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.467
- What am I looking at?
- Rolf Starr.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.811
A missing person
you're supposed to be tracking down.

22:36.940 --> 22:40.148
He may know who has the darkness Trouble.
- I'll check with McHugh and The Guard.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.436
Thanks.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.771
- You told his wife that you would find him.

22:46.908 --> 22:50.025
I'm working on it.
Try and find another lead.

22:52.121 --> 22:55.454
- Okay, what's going on, Dwight?
First the thief and now this?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.825
- It's easy making choices
from the sidelines,

22:58.962 --> 23:00.668
but sometimes,
things aren't what they seem.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.455
I got a town to protect.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.844
(Nathan): Plant's been abandoned,
so it hasn't been maintained.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.509
- There's our problem,

23:11.641 --> 23:13.427
two out of the four generator
turbines are offline.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.846
- No wonder the plant's working at 50%.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.844
- Then we could still have
a brownout tonight.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.846
Thousands could die.

23:19.983 --> 23:23.896
- You know how to fix it?
- Haven't got a clue.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.609
There's a reason I brought that engineer.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.980
- If we could get a big enough charge,
we could jump-start the turbine's motors.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.654
- And how do we do that?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.868
Guys, I'll try,

23:38.001 --> 23:41.368
but remember, I've never done
anything like this before.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.836
- You can do it. Trust me.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.163
- How?

23:47.844 --> 23:51.382
- There, grab hold.
Do your thing.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.630
- Come on. You can do it.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.052
- Huh.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.470
Simple.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.855
Get mad.

24:05.528 --> 24:07.189
Fat-free yogurt.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.865
The shroud. The Troubles.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.832
- Was that a good whoosh or a bad whoosh?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.050
- Good! The turbines are kicking in.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.379
What's it looking like over there, Dave?

24:34.515 --> 24:35.925
- It's working!

24:36.059 --> 24:38.391
The generator's now operating at 80%.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.931
90%.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.771
Almost 100%!

24:43.900 --> 24:45.060
(grunts)

24:45.193 --> 24:46.774
- We're red-lining! Kira, pull the plug.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.359
We're overloading!
- Cut it, Kira!

24:48.488 --> 24:50.103
- Not like I have a switch!

24:50.239 --> 24:51.365
- Kira, stop!

24:51.491 --> 24:52.526
Let go!

24:55.495 --> 24:59.238
(panting)

24:59.374 --> 25:01.615
(electricity crackles)
(alarm blaring)

25:01.751 --> 25:02.911
- What happened?

25:03.044 --> 25:05.706
(alarm blaring)

25:05.838 --> 25:07.339
(Charlotte): We overloaded the grid.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.462
All of Haven's without power.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.506
(alarm blaring)

25:20.853 --> 25:22.468
- So you don't remember Haven either?

25:22.605 --> 25:27.315
- No, no, I remember you and Dad in Derry

25:27.443 --> 25:30.025
and that one time that we went
go-kart racing in Cleaves Mills

25:30.154 --> 25:32.736
but no, not... not Haven.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.356
(sighs)
- Look, I...

25:37.286 --> 25:40.904
I'm not gonna be able to get you the money.
I'm sorry, I thought I could,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.452
but I don't know,
something's wrong with my bank.

25:43.584 --> 25:47.042
- Well, you can still help me
if you wanted to.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.331
- How's that?

25:48.464 --> 25:53.003
- When I was 12, I heard you and my dad
talking about using my mom on a job,

25:53.136 --> 25:55.673
using her special powers to get stuff.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.261
- So you remember the Troubles?

25:57.390 --> 25:59.255
- "Troubles"?

25:59.392 --> 26:02.054
No, l-l don't remember
calling them that, but...

26:02.186 --> 26:04.563
I remember my mom coming home
with other people's jewelry.

26:04.689 --> 26:07.351
My dad said the ability ran in the family.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.691
What if it's in me?
- Just pray that it's not.

26:10.820 --> 26:14.233
- I want to use it, Duke. I need to.
ljust...

26:15.658 --> 26:17.865
I need to know how.
- No.

26:17.994 --> 26:21.578
- I can't pay for the oil change they
made me get to park here and talk to you.

26:21.706 --> 26:25.244
- Don't worry about the oil change; I got it.
- You can't pay for it either, Duke!

26:25.376 --> 26:28.038
You have no money!
- Hailie, go home.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.583
You don't want anything
to do with that ability.

26:30.715 --> 26:31.750
Trust me.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.135
(Charlotte): We got lucky.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.558
Kira's Trouble triggered
the generator's circuit breaker,

26:48.691 --> 26:50.556
didn't cause any physical damage.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.729
We're making power,
we just gotta get it out.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.147
- So what's the prognosis?

26:54.280 --> 26:57.568
- I don't know. It's all so primitive.
An hour?

26:57.700 --> 27:00.066
- Well, that's just before sundown.

27:00.203 --> 27:01.909
I'll help in any way I can.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.450
- Then I'll get out of your way.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.198
- You have dinner reservations or something?

27:09.587 --> 27:12.294
- I've been getting a blip.
lt's weak, but it's there.

27:12.423 --> 27:15.586
If all goes well, I'll be back
with some aether by sunset.

27:15.718 --> 27:18.630
- It's a fool's errand, Nathan.
Aether's not important now.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.596
- It's better than sitting on my hands.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.931
- What's aether do?

27:25.394 --> 27:27.680
- It could end the Troubles.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.520
- You need help?
- No, they need you here.

27:29.649 --> 27:30.684
- No, they don't.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.853
The turbines are back up and running,

27:32.985 --> 27:36.944
and besides, it's the least
that I can do after...

27:37.073 --> 27:39.314
- Get your pack.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.157
(door opens)

28:01.848 --> 28:04.806
- What the hell is going on, Vince?
- Oh, Audrey.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.640
- That's Peggy's husband, Rolf.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.556
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Really?

28:09.689 --> 28:12.146
Because it looks like you and Dwight
are covering up a murder.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.482
- There's enough panic and fear as is.

28:14.610 --> 28:18.148
We didn't want to activate more Troubles.

28:18.281 --> 28:21.318
- What did him in?
- We don't know.

28:21.450 --> 28:25.659
There are no marks on him
except for... but he's not alone.

28:25.788 --> 28:28.996
Three other deaths in the last two weeks,

28:29.125 --> 28:32.083
and that's not including
Joe Sena and the Colorado kid.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.161
- My son?

28:35.298 --> 28:38.631
The same person murdered
my son 27 years ago?

28:40.303 --> 28:44.091
- We're calling his murderer
"the no marks killer."

28:44.223 --> 28:47.511
- A serial killer?

28:47.643 --> 28:49.634
That's what you're hiding from me?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.516
What else are you keeping from me, Vince?

28:53.649 --> 28:55.310
(sighs)

28:57.528 --> 29:01.362
- Dwight is doing his best
to keep order to enforce the rules,

29:01.490 --> 29:04.527
but he doesn't have it in him to kill.
- Yes, he does.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.823
In this Haven, banishment equals execution.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.627
- Not exactly.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.423
- What the...

29:28.184 --> 29:31.722
- Thanks to our friend there,
we're keeping them in a...

29:31.854 --> 29:33.139
prison of sorts.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.355
- Two weeks ago,
l was hit by a black tendril.

29:37.526 --> 29:41.895
Now the people I touch enter a slumber.

29:42.031 --> 29:45.649
They do not need to eat or drink,

29:45.785 --> 29:48.868
and they cannot hurt anyone.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.078
- lt's humane.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.076
- Are you sure?

29:57.213 --> 29:58.749
What kind of sleep are they experiencing?

29:58.881 --> 30:00.041
- Dreamless sleep.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.418
They're fine.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.047
- Are you?

30:11.560 --> 30:13.892
Did they force you to do this?

30:15.898 --> 30:17.809
Because I can get you out.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.984
- I offered to help.

30:22.113 --> 30:26.732
- Listen, if you change your mind,
just come and find me.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.566
- Thank you.

30:35.084 --> 30:37.450
- People need to know about this,
Vince, all of it.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.292
- And then what happens?

30:39.422 --> 30:41.959
Without the fear of banishments,
we'll have anarchy.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.975
- Not to hurry you, but...

30:56.105 --> 31:00.189
- Sun's about to set, and thousands will die.
Got it.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.353
- Is there anything I can do to help?

31:02.486 --> 31:04.772
Back rubs? Water?

31:05.781 --> 31:08.272
Shutting up?
- You're good.

31:12.288 --> 31:17.328
- Charlotte, if I'm from where you are,

31:17.460 --> 31:19.792
does that make me like you and Audrey?

31:21.297 --> 31:24.664
- Not really. You're a halfling.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.337
- Half human and...
- Half like me.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.051
It happens once in a blue moon.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.178
- Well, ever since I was a child,
l-l've been drawn to thinnies...

31:35.311 --> 31:37.848
and the Void.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.561
Am I just trying to go home?

31:41.317 --> 31:42.682
- I'm not sure.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.568
Very little is known about your kind.

31:47.323 --> 31:50.315
- What about visions? They common?

31:51.702 --> 31:53.988
(electricity crackles)

31:55.498 --> 31:58.035
- The solenoids are charging.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.498
- All four channels!

32:00.419 --> 32:03.536
Yet... we're still
in the red light district.

32:03.672 --> 32:04.878
(alarm blaring)

32:05.007 --> 32:06.213
(typing)

32:06.342 --> 32:07.878
This can't be right.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.298
It says the generator's
only operating at 40%.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.546
- Damn it, the generator must
have dumped its energy reserves

32:13.682 --> 32:15.058
when it overloaded.

32:15.184 --> 32:18.551
- That explains why the power's coming on
in town one block at a time.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.393
- How long between blocks?

32:20.523 --> 32:23.560
- Well, at this rate, five minutes or so.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.557
- How long before power gets to the school?

32:25.694 --> 32:26.900
- Hours.

32:28.197 --> 32:32.361
When the sun goes down, they all die.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.618
So I'm kind of running out of these,

32:43.754 --> 32:46.587
and they're the only thing that
are keeping the darkness from killing us.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.876
- Trust me, I'm not looking
to become Trouble food.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.883
There, I reconfigured
the generator settings

32:58.018 --> 33:02.011
to get power to the town faster,
but... that's the best I can do.

33:02.148 --> 33:05.185
- What about Kira?
Could she help us now?

33:05.317 --> 33:08.434
- She might be able to speed up
recharging the system,

33:08.571 --> 33:10.937
if she and Nathan get back soon.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.109
- They better get back soon.

33:15.286 --> 33:17.447
(people yelling)

33:17.580 --> 33:19.992
- Give me that flashlight!
(people yelling)

33:23.419 --> 33:25.580
(screams)

33:27.339 --> 33:30.797
- It's a powder keg.
We got to do something.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.918
- Hey! All right,
everyone take a deep breath!

33:37.224 --> 33:40.933
Tonight may be our greatest test,

33:42.313 --> 33:47.307
but we will face it...
as friends, as neighbors,

33:47.443 --> 33:49.525
as a town.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.689
The darkness will not take another life.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.985
So help each other.
Crowd around the lamps.

33:55.117 --> 33:58.655
Share supplies. Stay in the light.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.784
(indistinct chatter)

34:02.917 --> 34:05.829
Now we just gotta pull it off
if we want to survive till sunlight.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.123
(woman): Stay by this light.
(man): Come on.

34:09.256 --> 34:10.757
- Maybe.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.962
Maybe not.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.804
You ready for that rain check?

34:22.937 --> 34:24.143
- Yeah, of course.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.431
- Okay.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.189
Hey.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.859
Your blouse is so beautiful,
and your hair...

34:35.991 --> 34:37.527
- You do go on.

34:37.660 --> 34:40.993
- No, it's so soft, and it's silky, and...

34:42.998 --> 34:44.374
Glow.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.167
Wait.

34:51.048 --> 34:53.084
(crowd murmuring)
(chuckles)

34:53.217 --> 34:54.878
(woman): Wow.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.841
(crowd murmuring)

35:07.690 --> 35:10.727
(beeping)

35:13.529 --> 35:16.896
- It says we should be right
on top of the aether.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.899
(rapid beeping)

35:20.035 --> 35:23.277
Come on. Not now.

35:23.414 --> 35:24.870
We're running out of lights.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.042
- Get mad, get mad, get mad.

35:32.381 --> 35:33.370
(grunts)

35:33.507 --> 35:34.917
(panting)

35:35.050 --> 35:37.302
I don't know how long
I can keep doing this.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.132
We have to head back to the plant.

35:41.265 --> 35:44.052
- This was supposed to work.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.968
- It hasn't all been bad.

35:48.105 --> 35:49.845
The cots at the school are comfy.

35:51.358 --> 35:55.067
Besides, if it weren't for the shroud,
I'd be miserable in Venice right now.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.402
- What's in Venice?

35:57.531 --> 35:59.442
- Long story.

35:59.575 --> 36:03.033
I'll put it this way, I'm happier here.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.246
Let's get back?

36:15.215 --> 36:16.466
- Hey.

36:16.592 --> 36:19.254
(wind blowing)

36:21.221 --> 36:23.633
Where's that breeze coming from?

36:23.766 --> 36:27.600
(beeping)

36:33.901 --> 36:36.938
(rapid beeping)

36:51.085 --> 36:52.450
- Now what?

36:52.586 --> 36:54.542
- There's aether down there.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.172
We follow.

37:00.636 --> 37:03.469
(Vince): Okay, let's try this again.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.805
(cheers and applause)

37:17.403 --> 37:20.486
(sighs)

37:22.324 --> 37:24.110
Hi, Tony.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.824
- They're not back.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.284
- No.

37:27.413 --> 37:30.075
- Well, they must be okay.
They got the power back on.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.615
And it's daytime. They can make it back.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.457
- Yes.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.374
- All right, shift change.
I'm worried you're gonna wear out that spot.

37:38.507 --> 37:41.499
- I'd like to take you up on it,
but knowing Dave's timing,

37:41.635 --> 37:43.626
he'd arrive then,
and I'd never hear the end of it.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.502
(chuckles): Yeah.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.630
Kira's the exact opposite.

37:47.766 --> 37:51.725
She'd blow a gasket knowing that all I did
for the last two days was worry.

37:51.854 --> 37:54.516
- Sometimes, that's all we can d...

37:57.818 --> 37:59.649
They're back.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.233
Oh, good work, old man.
You pulled through.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.402
The power's back on stronger than ever.

38:06.535 --> 38:09.402
- I played Watson. Charlotte was the hero.

38:09.538 --> 38:11.654
- Where's my fiancee? Where's Kira?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.701
- And Nathan?
- They're not here?

38:13.834 --> 38:15.119
- No.

38:16.003 --> 38:18.210
- They left us yesterday afternoon.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.715
- And didn't come back.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.214
- What?

38:23.343 --> 38:26.710
What do you mean, they left you?
Where did they go?

38:32.352 --> 38:34.092
- Hello?

38:34.229 --> 38:36.015
- Over here.

38:38.400 --> 38:43.064
- l, uh, got your call.
What's wrong with my car now?

38:43.906 --> 38:45.862
- It's a piece ofjunk.

38:47.910 --> 38:51.903
But work with me...
you'll be able to buy a nice new whip.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.779
(both chuckle)

38:53.916 --> 38:56.999
- Yeah, I don't think so, creep hat.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.086
- Think again.

39:02.049 --> 39:04.040
I heard you got skills
that let you steal stuff.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.632
- I don't.

39:05.761 --> 39:08.298
I should, but I don't.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.297
- Too bad.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.094
You know, I looked you up, Hailie Colton.

39:14.228 --> 39:16.640
Seems you owe money
to some mutual friends of ours.

39:18.690 --> 39:22.933
Get in the damn car now.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.571
(grunts)

39:34.039 --> 39:36.280
(both grunting)

39:36.416 --> 39:37.747
- Bitch.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.331
Ah!
(winces)

39:41.463 --> 39:43.454
- They're not gonna pay you. I'm broke!

39:43.590 --> 39:46.002
- They know. You're an example now.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.090
| get paid for you, dead or alive.

39:49.972 --> 39:52.429
And I'm thinking dead is gonna be easier.

39:55.644 --> 39:58.932
(tires screeching)

40:01.733 --> 40:03.314
(tires screech)

40:07.155 --> 40:08.565
- Get in the truck!

40:09.783 --> 40:11.990
- What...
How the...

40:12.119 --> 40:13.655
The car went through me!

40:13.787 --> 40:15.652
- Well, actually, technically,
you went through it.

40:15.789 --> 40:17.495
- Is that my thing?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.829
You did it!
(laughs)

40:21.962 --> 40:25.625
- I did it to save your life.
Let's just hope it doesn't end it.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.293
Now, come on, get in!

40:27.426 --> 40:29.132
- Yeah, okay.

40:34.016 --> 40:37.179
(tires screeching)

40:49.114 --> 40:50.729
- Can we talk?

40:50.866 --> 40:54.324
- I already heard about Nathan.
I'm going after him.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.865
(gentle music)

40:56.997 --> 40:59.079
Move or I will make you.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.198
- Audrey...
- Let go of me.

41:01.335 --> 41:02.950
Let go!

41:04.671 --> 41:05.751
- Come here.

41:07.007 --> 41:09.089
(sobs)

41:11.845 --> 41:13.346
It's okay.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.093
(sobs)

41:18.226 --> 41:21.514
- It can't be true.
(sobs)

41:21.647 --> 41:24.889
(people murmuring in the distance)

41:25.025 --> 41:26.185
(woman): Hey, Nathan's back!

41:26.318 --> 41:27.433
- Nathan?

41:29.154 --> 41:31.315
Nathan!

41:50.509 --> 41:53.046
(sighs)

41:54.721 --> 41:56.131
- Where's Kira?

41:56.264 --> 41:59.756
- In a minute.
I need to report to Dwight.

41:59.893 --> 42:02.555
- No, not until we get some answers.

42:03.939 --> 42:06.806
Why did you leave the power plant?
That wasn't the mission.

42:06.942 --> 42:08.398
What did you do to Kira?

42:17.869 --> 42:20.121
- We got stuck in the dark.
- What?

42:20.247 --> 42:21.327
- Kira's dead.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.071
(all gasping and murmuring)

42:25.585 --> 42:26.961
- You bastard!

42:27.087 --> 42:29.624
You son of a bitch! This is your fault!

42:29.756 --> 42:31.496
All of it! It's your fault!

42:31.633 --> 42:33.214
You killed her!

42:34.928 --> 42:37.135
(overlapping shouting)

42:59.119 --> 43:01.906
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
