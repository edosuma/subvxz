00:35.921 --> 00:37.121
How's your new boyfriend?

00:37.321 --> 00:39.881
He's been really sweet since
his mother died.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.961
Nice earrings. Where'd you get them?

00:42.161 --> 00:43.401
He gave them to me.

00:48.161 --> 00:50.401
I won't let him touch me any more.

00:50.601 --> 00:52.441
Can you imagine? With a nurse.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.921
They did it at our place.

00:58.721 --> 01:00.161
Jéréme wouldn't do that.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.041
Actually, he hasn't done
anything for months.

01:06.281 --> 01:07.921
I want a tattoo.

01:08.121 --> 01:09.601
Doesn't it hurt?

01:09.801 --> 01:12.281
Sometimes I like that when we fuck.

01:12.481 --> 01:13.361
What do you mean?

01:15.001 --> 01:16.881
You've never been spanked?

01:17.081 --> 01:17.961
On the ass?

01:18.521 --> 01:20.521
That's where it's usually done.

01:20.721 --> 01:22.041
Are you crazy?

01:22.241 --> 01:24.641
My guy'd never do that.
He respects me.

01:24.841 --> 01:26.641
He must not be very good.

01:30.681 --> 01:33.321
I'm so lucky. My new one fucks
me like a rabbit.

01:33.521 --> 01:36.601
I'm all irritated. It's
almost too much.

01:37.921 --> 01:40.281
Do you really want to get a tattoo?

01:40.481 --> 01:41.761
What kind of a tattoo?

01:41.961 --> 01:43.081
Below my belly button.

01:44.001 --> 01:46.201
The word "paradise" or something.

01:46.401 --> 01:48.561
- The usual. - She's nuts.

01:50.561 --> 01:53.361
How about "You're Welcome"?

01:55.601 --> 01:58.041
I want to drive them crazy.

02:01.801 --> 02:02.761
<i>To Cyril Collard</i>

02:02.961 --> 02:04.921
<i>and to all those who still believe</i>

02:05.121 --> 02:06.801
<i>that love means something.</i>

02:35.961 --> 02:37.481
Where do you want to go?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.841
Stop here. This is fine.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.841
- Here? - Yes, please.

02:59.961 --> 03:00.761
Is this ok?

03:01.001 --> 03:02.721
Yeah, wherever. I don't care.

03:37.401 --> 03:39.161
What were you looking for
back at the bar?

03:40.441 --> 03:42.681
A Tupperware container or something.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.161
What for?

03:47.881 --> 03:49.401
For my father's ashes.

03:50.201 --> 03:51.561
You went to a bar

03:52.281 --> 03:54.001
to get a container for his ashes?

03:57.161 --> 04:00.841
I had them in a plastic bag but
it had a hole in it.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.561
My father kept leaving.

04:05.561 --> 04:07.081
Half of him blew away.

04:10.681 --> 04:11.961
Are you allowed

04:12.161 --> 04:14.881
to carry someone's ashes
around like that?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.921
I don't want to leave him in a ditch.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.081
So you stole the...

04:22.000 --> 04:22.721
You can't do that.

04:23.881 --> 04:26.161
He worked his whole life
to provide for me.

04:26.361 --> 04:27.801
It's the least I can do.

04:29.041 --> 04:32.361
He was a painter but
he refused to sell his work.

04:33.401 --> 04:35.121
He was a bodywork repairman.

04:36.001 --> 04:37.641
Ironically,

04:38.441 --> 04:39.841
the paint got to his lungs.

04:42.881 --> 04:45.801
We found out he was sick when
he went to the hospital.

04:47.801 --> 04:49.041
He never came out again.

04:49.361 --> 04:50.441
That's too bad.

04:52.441 --> 04:54.121
I don't know what to say.

04:59.481 --> 05:01.801
You're really gullible, aren't you?

05:02.361 --> 05:03.641
I can't believe you.

05:04.121 --> 05:06.161
The guy spent his life slaving away

05:06.361 --> 05:08.601
and his retirement in a cemetery.

05:09.801 --> 05:10.921
Why are you like that?

05:11.121 --> 05:12.281
Come on, let's go.

05:14.521 --> 05:16.041
Don't you want to kiss me?

05:16.921 --> 05:18.121
Don't you have a boyfriend?

05:18.321 --> 05:20.681
He's a nice guy. He won't beat you up.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.041
Your friend said he'd pay
us every week.

05:23.241 --> 05:27.361
Yes, but you know Maurice.
He said we took our time.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.161
We were only going to redo one room,
not everything.

05:31.361 --> 05:32.601
Yeah, that's true.

05:32.801 --> 05:35.161
So he's two weeks late in paying us.

05:36.001 --> 05:37.601
Chance, wait.

05:39.921 --> 05:40.921
What?

05:59.521 --> 06:02.281
He wasn't very nice but
he'll think about it.

06:02.961 --> 06:04.081
Cool.

06:05.721 --> 06:06.681
No, not cool.

06:23.561 --> 06:25.961
What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

06:27.801 --> 06:30.801
I met a girl, kind of by chance.

06:31.081 --> 06:34.401
Are you blind? Didn't you
see me coming?

06:35.001 --> 06:37.961
You want me to calm down?
Look at my car!

06:38.201 --> 06:39.601
You stink of beer!

06:47.721 --> 06:48.961
Is that your dad?

06:49.801 --> 06:51.081
The louder one is.

06:51.921 --> 06:53.641
It must not always be easy.

06:56.521 --> 06:57.841
Are you a mechanic?

06:58.081 --> 07:00.601
I repair cars. It's not always easy.

07:06.361 --> 07:08.161
We've been together ever since.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.121
It's complicated. Her dad...

07:10.361 --> 07:11.641
I have to pee.

07:13.241 --> 07:14.361
Are you staying here?

07:44.721 --> 07:46.321
Are you looking for me?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.801
What are you playing at?

07:49.281 --> 07:50.601
Don't you like games?

07:55.521 --> 07:57.201
What do you think of my ass?

07:58.081 --> 07:59.121
What are you doing?

07:59.361 --> 08:00.561
Do you like my ass?

08:00.761 --> 08:01.961
What do you think?

08:02.641 --> 08:04.721
How about my breasts?

08:05.961 --> 08:07.681
Of course I like your breasts.

08:12.281 --> 08:13.681
And my nipples?

08:14.881 --> 08:16.761
Do you feel how hard they are?

08:22.721 --> 08:23.641
Stop it.

08:25.041 --> 08:26.201
Touch me.

08:27.801 --> 08:29.001
Touch me.

08:33.321 --> 08:34.760
And my pussy?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.280
Can you feel how wet it is?

08:42.881 --> 08:44.160
I'm gonna fuck you.

08:44.361 --> 08:46.241
If you fuck me, I'll yell.

08:47.521 --> 08:48.561
Touch me...

08:49.241 --> 08:51.241
If you yell, no one will hear you.

08:51.641 --> 08:53.161
Don't you like yelling?

08:53.921 --> 08:55.681
Only when I make girls come.

08:58.481 --> 09:00.161
I don't mind if you touch me.

09:01.921 --> 09:03.561
You can do whatever you want.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.841
But you can't fuck me.

09:07.801 --> 09:10.521
- What if I fuck you anyway?
- You don't get it.

09:11.201 --> 09:12.841
I must be too dumb.

09:19.481 --> 09:20.881
You're too impatient.

09:21.641 --> 09:25.041
Which one do you like better?
My pussy or my ass?

09:29.201 --> 09:30.761
I'm gonna give it to you.

09:41.441 --> 09:42.521
You're not listening.

09:54.641 --> 09:55.961
Am I torturing you?

09:56.401 --> 09:57.521
You poor bitch.

09:58.881 --> 10:01.321
But a bitch you'd like to fuck.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.921
What do you want?

10:04.321 --> 10:06.881
You can't fuck me and think
of someone else.

10:07.601 --> 10:08.841
Will you drive me back?

10:33.401 --> 10:34.481
What are you doing here?

10:34.681 --> 10:35.881
You're out of breath.

10:36.081 --> 10:38.601
Yeah, Alex and I had a problem.

10:41.161 --> 10:43.041
Maurice chased us.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.761
Can we get out of here?

10:46.961 --> 10:48.001
No, we can't.

10:49.321 --> 10:52.161
- What good is your car?
- Not much right now.

10:53.601 --> 10:54.561
Did it break down?

10:58.281 --> 11:01.281
I promised Sonia I would take her
to the Caen funfair.

11:02.321 --> 11:04.081
But my car...

11:04.881 --> 11:07.161
Other than pushing it
or blowing it up,

11:07.361 --> 11:09.401
I don't see how I can make it move.

11:12.441 --> 11:15.521
For an electronic nerd who can
start any kind of car,

11:15.721 --> 11:17.081
you disappoint me.

11:20.521 --> 11:23.401
In case you didn't notice,
my car is a 96 Fiat.

11:24.401 --> 11:27.801
Back then you almost had
to pedal for a PC to work.

11:30.081 --> 11:31.881
Don't you have a date with Cécile?

11:32.081 --> 11:34.001
Oh, shit!

11:50.081 --> 11:51.601
Well, see you soon.

11:51.841 --> 11:52.921
Yeah, whatever.

11:53.561 --> 11:55.401
Come on, don't sulk.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.761
You never know, maybe we'll
fuck some day.

12:08.841 --> 12:10.241
You're such a ladies' man.

12:10.441 --> 12:12.161
You never fucking stop.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.321
Do you always act like a slut?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.481
You're cute.

12:16.761 --> 12:19.081
Don't give up so easily.

12:36.641 --> 12:39.041
- How are you doing?
- It's pretty simple.

12:39.721 --> 12:41.761
Red cards for the sale prices,

12:42.441 --> 12:44.441
blue cards for regular prices.

12:45.161 --> 12:46.201
What do you study?

12:46.401 --> 12:48.801
Political science. I'm not too
good at math.

12:49.521 --> 12:50.881
Will you manage?

12:51.081 --> 12:52.841
Don't worry, Mr. Daniel.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.401
I want to spend more time with you...

13:01.241 --> 13:02.241
all the time.

13:04.081 --> 13:07.441
But just telling you that scares me.

13:07.801 --> 13:09.801
I'm afraid I'll scare you away.

13:12.321 --> 13:15.321
When you leave, I'm afraid I'll
never see you again.

13:17.401 --> 13:20.801
It's horrible to feel how much you
could make me suffer

13:21.481 --> 13:23.441
if you were to disappear.

13:44.561 --> 13:45.921
I love you.

13:47.401 --> 13:49.081
Will you come to my place?

13:50.081 --> 13:51.881
Stop asking me that.

13:52.721 --> 13:55.521
Don't you want to? You've
never come over.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.561
Yeah, I want to, but...

13:59.441 --> 14:01.321
you don't understand what I want.

14:04.961 --> 14:08.801
I'd like to live in a house
with a big garden,

14:09.201 --> 14:11.001
with flowers everywhere

14:11.521 --> 14:12.761
and horses

14:13.641 --> 14:15.321
and lots of children.

14:16.601 --> 14:18.521
- You don't like horses? - I do.

14:20.601 --> 14:22.681
What do you mean she left with a guy?

14:23.161 --> 14:24.481
We had a date.

14:24.721 --> 14:27.601
She wanted to see the sea. Matt,
Big Bernard's son,

14:27.801 --> 14:28.921
offered to take her.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.401
Shit, there's water everywhere here.

14:32.081 --> 14:33.401
She left this.

14:35.961 --> 14:36.841
What is that?

14:37.521 --> 14:39.801
The remnants of her ashtray?
Who knows.

14:40.001 --> 14:42.481
- Wait, don't open it. - What is it?

14:42.721 --> 14:46.001
It's Cécile's... I mean the...
forget it.

14:46.801 --> 14:48.401
Tell her I took her dad home.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.761
Do you mind if I put
this in the trunk?

14:58.641 --> 15:00.601
Just don't leave your shit in there.

15:00.961 --> 15:03.481
It's not mine. Don't joke about it.

15:03.681 --> 15:06.041
Aren't we touchy? Give me a wrench.

15:17.401 --> 15:18.761
Does this thing work?

15:20.441 --> 15:21.521
Yeah, it works.

15:22.281 --> 15:23.881
But when you find money,

15:24.081 --> 15:26.681
the land owner gets half of the cash.

15:27.161 --> 15:29.281
Half of the cash is still cash.

15:30.481 --> 15:34.041
Yeah but it takes ages, and the
equipment is expensive.

15:41.481 --> 15:42.841
What does Sonia think?

15:43.041 --> 15:44.921
I've stopped thinking of her.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.321
That's not what you said 3 months ago.

15:50.921 --> 15:53.121
We shouldn't have moved in together.

15:59.161 --> 16:02.321
Here's your thing back.

16:04.401 --> 16:06.481
I'm staying out of trouble for now.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.361
Did you try it?

16:10.921 --> 16:12.361
No, I didn't have time.

16:12.801 --> 16:15.601
Is that your tool for stealing cars?
Can I try it?

16:19.241 --> 16:21.721
If you can get out of here with it,
go for it.

16:21.921 --> 16:23.121
Where will he go?

16:23.321 --> 16:24.601
I don't know.

16:25.841 --> 16:26.881
Straight up there.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.401
You're not easy to find.

16:49.881 --> 16:51.241
Will you come over?

16:53.601 --> 16:54.681
If you want me to.

17:33.601 --> 17:34.921
You can't sleep?

17:45.241 --> 17:46.401
Do you want some water?

17:50.641 --> 17:51.641
I'm exhausted.

18:00.161 --> 18:03.641
Your mother called me. She
left several messages.

18:06.641 --> 18:08.281
You won't answer her calls.

18:15.081 --> 18:16.001
Stop it.

18:17.121 --> 18:18.081
Why?

18:19.041 --> 18:20.761
I'm not in the mood.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.721
Don't I turn you on any more?

18:23.241 --> 18:24.761
I'd have to be dead.

18:24.961 --> 18:26.241
Don't say that.

18:31.121 --> 18:32.361
You turn me on.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.481
Cécile, please...

18:38.401 --> 18:39.441
Stop.

18:45.761 --> 18:47.761
See how I still turn you on?

18:59.801 --> 19:01.361
Do you want to kill me?

19:09.721 --> 19:10.881
You're mine.

19:38.121 --> 19:40.121
- I'm talking about desire.
- Pleasure?

19:40.321 --> 19:41.281
It's complicated.

19:41.761 --> 19:44.441
There's a difference between
desire and love.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.721
Men are all the same.

19:46.921 --> 19:48.801
Mine doesn't know that I can come.

19:49.001 --> 19:52.121
I slept with a guy who didn't
know what a clit was.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.961
He thought I had a button
between my legs.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.441
Going down on me disgusted him.

19:57.641 --> 19:59.761
When we're single, we bitch about it.

19:59.961 --> 20:02.281
When we're not, we bitch at the guy.

20:02.841 --> 20:04.761
There's something wrong with that.

20:12.401 --> 20:13.401
Where are we going?

20:13.601 --> 20:15.761
To see a guy I know well. Don't worry.

20:17.121 --> 20:18.601
What are you doing?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.241
I don't have the keys.

20:33.001 --> 20:33.841
Shit!

20:34.041 --> 20:35.281
Do you need help, fatso?

20:47.721 --> 20:50.121
- Come over for diner.
- I'm seeing Cécile.

20:52.361 --> 20:53.561
Do you like it?

20:55.081 --> 20:56.441
I don't know.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.121
You said there was no one here.

21:01.321 --> 21:03.401
There's no one in the offices.

21:03.601 --> 21:05.601
Then why are you whispering?

21:05.801 --> 21:08.521
I'm not whispering. Go ahead,

21:09.001 --> 21:10.281
draw me something.

21:30.601 --> 21:32.361
Yesterday Alizée was crazy.

21:33.121 --> 21:37.081
She was dressed all sexy and
glamorous, you know?

21:37.481 --> 21:40.761
I started touching her and
she was into it.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.001
Suddenly, she pushed me away.

21:44.441 --> 21:46.041
Don't try to understand.

21:46.361 --> 21:49.361
Wait, there's more. I was tired
so I went to sleep.

21:49.561 --> 21:52.721
I dreamt that someone was
holding my cock.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.921
I woke up and saw her jerking
me off like crazy.

21:57.401 --> 22:01.281
She just took my cock and
stuck it in her pussy.

22:01.721 --> 22:03.241
It was crazy.

22:04.681 --> 22:06.081
Go on, concentrate.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.601
You fuckers!

22:51.001 --> 22:52.481
<i>Pay up, Maurice</i>

23:18.841 --> 23:20.801
- What are you doing? -
I wanted to see you.

23:21.001 --> 23:23.321
You can't just show up like this.

23:24.081 --> 23:25.641
You can't stay here.

23:26.001 --> 23:27.201
Did you miss me?

23:28.041 --> 23:30.441
- Yes, but you don't understand...
- I do.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.481
I understand that I need you.

23:41.841 --> 23:43.001
Not here.

23:52.721 --> 23:53.761
Alice?

24:02.921 --> 24:03.801
Yes?

24:06.161 --> 24:09.081
Your father wants you
to clean the trash cans.

24:09.561 --> 24:11.801
He asked me to put them in the shed.

24:15.081 --> 24:17.521
He's been a pain lately.

24:19.801 --> 24:21.321
Don't hold it against him.

24:24.121 --> 24:25.281
He's tired.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.241
They're making him work twice as hard

24:30.441 --> 24:33.001
since they laid off half
of his coworkers.

24:33.761 --> 24:35.121
That's awful.

24:36.921 --> 24:38.521
It's not easy for him

24:39.921 --> 24:41.801
after 30 years on the job.

24:43.001 --> 24:44.201
That's for sure.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.121
What are you doing?

24:48.601 --> 24:50.161
Are you making fun of me?

24:56.041 --> 24:58.481
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

24:59.921 --> 25:01.201
Didn't you like it?

25:01.401 --> 25:02.801
That's not the point.

25:05.161 --> 25:06.521
I like you.

25:07.121 --> 25:09.081
You don't know how much.

25:11.281 --> 25:13.281
I can't live without you.

25:16.841 --> 25:18.521
What did you say earlier?

25:18.721 --> 25:19.681
Never mind.

25:20.961 --> 25:23.321
Do you think I shouldn't
have fucked her?

25:29.401 --> 25:30.921
What are you doing with that?

25:31.601 --> 25:33.361
I need a lamp for my house.

25:36.681 --> 25:39.481
Chance, do you think
I shouldn't have fucked her?

25:39.841 --> 25:40.841
Come on.

25:45.041 --> 25:46.041
Tell me.

25:46.241 --> 25:48.721
- Forget it. - Tell me,
I'm your buddy.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.361
You don't want to tell me?

26:04.081 --> 26:05.441
What's wrong?

26:07.521 --> 26:09.561
I'm wondering what you really want.

26:10.201 --> 26:11.361
You, for starters.

26:12.761 --> 26:14.121
Do you want to do me?

26:14.761 --> 26:15.961
Do you want a blow job?

26:16.761 --> 26:18.081
If you want to.

26:36.041 --> 26:37.361
Are you happy?

26:43.961 --> 26:45.161
Does it relax you?

26:46.681 --> 26:47.521
What?

26:49.881 --> 26:52.481
After you come, I can bring
you a beer.

26:52.681 --> 26:53.761
Ok, stop.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.441
What's your problem?

27:25.521 --> 27:26.521
What's wrong?

27:27.321 --> 27:28.361
It's you.

27:29.601 --> 27:30.841
What did I do?

27:33.281 --> 27:35.601
All those women you slept with...

27:36.521 --> 27:37.921
I have nightmares about it.

27:38.121 --> 27:41.241
Don't think about it. It was
a long time ago.

27:41.441 --> 27:43.001
What can I do about it?

27:44.641 --> 27:47.441
It hurts me so much that
I can barely sleep.

28:00.041 --> 28:02.001
I'm crazy about you.

28:02.321 --> 28:04.681
There is only you, you know. Just you.

28:07.601 --> 28:09.481
We're like a big family here.

28:09.841 --> 28:11.601
You're my daughter's age.

28:14.041 --> 28:17.841
I like working with people who are
on the same wavelength.

28:18.041 --> 28:20.401
Call me Maurice. It'll be simpler.

28:21.281 --> 28:21.921
Ok?

28:23.681 --> 28:25.881
Come on, I'll show you the workshop.

28:29.761 --> 28:31.081
You'll like it.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.881
See? We careen boats.

28:35.721 --> 28:38.321
We remove the paint and
we repair them like new.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.641
I told you to get out of here.

28:45.481 --> 28:46.361
Come on.

28:47.041 --> 28:48.521
I like you, you know?

28:48.881 --> 28:50.201
I like you very much.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.761
You're not shy, you know
what you want.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.881
Do you feel your daughter up?

28:57.081 --> 28:58.161
I'm sorry?

28:58.401 --> 29:00.521
Aren't I the same age
as your daughter?

29:00.721 --> 29:01.641
So what?

29:01.841 --> 29:03.001
You're touching me...

29:03.841 --> 29:05.281
I thought you were smart.

29:05.481 --> 29:08.801
I don't find my future
ex-boss too brilliant.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.041
- I don't like your tone.
- I'll explain.

29:12.481 --> 29:14.801
I don't use my body as an elevator,
get it?

29:15.641 --> 29:16.801
Let me make it clear.

29:17.321 --> 29:19.241
If you want the job, lie down.

29:20.161 --> 29:23.161
You piece of shit. Who do you
think you are, asshole?

29:26.521 --> 29:27.801
You better see a doctor.

29:28.401 --> 29:30.001
Nothing to do with your balls.

29:30.241 --> 29:33.161
You need to get all that shit
out of your head!

29:38.681 --> 29:39.921
She was out of control.

29:40.121 --> 29:42.241
I didn't know if I should fuck her.

29:42.441 --> 29:44.761
- Losing her dad turned her on.
- Yeah.

29:44.961 --> 29:48.401
If it has that effect, she should
lose him more often.

29:48.601 --> 29:52.081
- Don't say that, please.
- You guys are weird.

29:52.521 --> 29:56.481
- I've known her since we were 7. - So
have I but we don't fuck.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.281
How old were you the first time, 15?

29:59.641 --> 30:01.361
And two years later,

30:01.561 --> 30:04.401
there was Léonore who made
you all crazy.

30:05.161 --> 30:07.681
I don't want to get attached.
Neither does she.

30:07.881 --> 30:09.641
I could attach her to the bed...

30:09.841 --> 30:10.921
That sounds like love.

30:11.161 --> 30:13.041
Love is two weeks of happiness,

30:13.241 --> 30:16.161
two months of arguing and two
years of recovering.

30:16.361 --> 30:18.361
We hang out when we feel like it.

30:18.881 --> 30:21.801
I don't want to miss out
on all the other chicks.

30:22.641 --> 30:25.121
No jealousy. Shit, it's perfect.

30:26.881 --> 30:28.441
- Shit. - That's what I just said.

30:28.681 --> 30:30.481
Shit, Manu! Run!

30:32.481 --> 30:33.561
Fucked

30:38.881 --> 30:40.081
You son of a bitch!

30:43.281 --> 30:44.401
You little bitch!

31:18.601 --> 31:20.521
Manu, is there any vodka left?

31:20.721 --> 31:22.001
How should I know?

31:22.921 --> 31:25.241
I'm sick of him beating on that thing.

31:26.401 --> 31:28.001
Is something wrong, Manu?

31:28.201 --> 31:30.641
He got beat up by Chance's friends.

31:31.281 --> 31:34.161
Cécile, your boyfriend's
always in trouble.

31:34.361 --> 31:36.281
That's none of my business.

31:36.481 --> 31:39.081
Yesterday he was telling
me about the strike

31:39.281 --> 31:40.801
and I was listening,

31:41.001 --> 31:43.161
when suddenly he lifted up my skirt

31:43.361 --> 31:45.721
and tried to do me.

31:45.921 --> 31:47.121
Can you believe it?

31:47.681 --> 31:49.281
Manu would never dare to do that.

31:49.481 --> 31:51.801
He'd be scared that I'd rip
his balls off.

31:52.001 --> 31:53.641
Go on, show off for them.

31:53.841 --> 31:56.241
I'll take you while you do the dishes,
honey.

31:56.441 --> 31:57.961
I never do the dishes.

31:58.281 --> 32:00.401
You need to clean up soon.

32:00.601 --> 32:03.681
My landlord is after me. I owe
him 3 months' rent.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.041
He's getting pissed.

32:05.241 --> 32:07.441
Next, your boss will fire you.

32:07.641 --> 32:10.681
What's wrong with you? I got
fired three months ago.

32:11.201 --> 32:12.441
I'm glad I have friends.

32:12.641 --> 32:15.241
- I'm sorry. - It's ok, you're drunk.

32:15.561 --> 32:16.561
She's not drunk.

32:16.761 --> 32:18.601
I'm waiting for my corkscrew.

32:20.641 --> 32:22.401
How was the funeral?

32:22.961 --> 32:24.001
It's over.

32:24.561 --> 32:28.401
Shouldn't we do something to get
ourselves out of this shit?

32:29.041 --> 32:31.481
How do we find jobs when
there are none?

32:32.201 --> 32:34.801
We could start a solidarity fund.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.441
That's a good idea but how do
we get money in there?

32:40.961 --> 32:43.681
We have some cards up our sleeves.

32:43.881 --> 32:45.041
- What cards? - I don't know.

32:45.241 --> 32:48.081
Do you think we're gonna sleep
around for money?

32:49.001 --> 32:49.681
Whatever.

32:50.081 --> 32:52.441
Who's coming climbing this weekend?

32:52.641 --> 32:53.561
Climbing onto whom?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.561
Climbing up a cliff.

32:56.761 --> 32:57.921
With ropes.

32:58.121 --> 33:00.201
You'd like that, wouldn't you Cécile?

33:01.121 --> 33:03.521
I know someone who'd love
to tie you up.

33:05.761 --> 33:07.521
I think she'd like that.

33:07.721 --> 33:10.361
I never get attached, sweetie. Never.

33:10.561 --> 33:11.961
I doubt it. Are you sure?

33:14.521 --> 33:15.321
I'm sure.

33:16.801 --> 33:19.321
What if I did it?

33:20.441 --> 33:23.081
- You won't get anywhere with me.
- Shall we try?

33:57.281 --> 33:58.521
Do you like it?

34:04.601 --> 34:06.441
Stop, I feel ashamed.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.641
It's like I'm doing something wrong.

34:14.241 --> 34:16.721
But don't stop, just don't stop.

34:39.561 --> 34:41.440
Is there any beer left?

34:45.001 --> 34:46.360
It sounds scary.

34:48.001 --> 34:50.121
Do you really think it sounds scary?

35:00.841 --> 35:02.161
Is that all you have?

35:03.081 --> 35:05.521
I'll see what I can do.
Come by tomorrow.

35:05.721 --> 35:06.761
Thanks.

35:14.401 --> 35:15.321
Matt?

35:15.681 --> 35:18.041
Have a look at the boy's Fiat.
It's easy.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.321
- Let me just finish this. - Here.

35:20.921 --> 35:22.321
That's all he has.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.041
You can't help people out for nothing.

35:25.241 --> 35:26.961
How will you get ahead like that?

35:27.161 --> 35:30.121
It's no big deal. I'm
expecting clients soon.

35:30.681 --> 35:32.241
Otherwise I'm in big trouble.

35:33.281 --> 35:35.081
Don't worry. It'll be ok.

35:39.761 --> 35:42.041
Shit, he almost got me last time.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.521
Some poor guy will
be stuck repainting it.

35:46.401 --> 35:47.601
Move over.

35:48.801 --> 35:50.441
You and your fucking stories.

35:53.481 --> 35:54.961
I didn't think he'd get you.

35:55.161 --> 35:56.241
You're careless.

35:57.081 --> 35:59.361
Of course you get people into shit.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.801
You're in a bad mood.

36:05.681 --> 36:09.321
When will you realize you have
to get wet to swim?

36:11.641 --> 36:13.481
I didn't think you'd get caught.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.601
- Are you ok? - Yeah.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.441
Are you sure?

36:35.241 --> 36:37.001
I'm fine. It's the booze.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.521
Sonia's not there?

36:44.721 --> 36:47.321
- Do you see her? - Do you
know about tomorrow?

36:48.881 --> 36:52.641
She asked me to help Serge to take
stuff out of his bar.

36:53.481 --> 36:56.041
I don't know where she is.
I don't give a shit.

36:56.241 --> 36:58.521
I got rid of that slut.

36:58.721 --> 37:00.841
She was crying. It was pathetic.

37:02.641 --> 37:04.081
What's up with you?

37:05.361 --> 37:06.721
Girls don't deserve us.

37:10.401 --> 37:14.041
I'll stick a bag over their heads,
that'll teach them.

37:14.401 --> 37:16.081
They'll learn to think twice.

37:17.001 --> 37:18.801
Keep them at home.

37:19.801 --> 37:21.001
No, in the cellar.

37:21.321 --> 37:23.601
That way no one will hear them yell.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.121
We'll pull off their nipples

37:27.161 --> 37:30.081
and burn their pussies if they
fuck the neighbor.

37:31.641 --> 37:33.241
Why are you Saying that?

37:33.921 --> 37:34.801
Forget it.

37:45.201 --> 37:47.161
With the pound losing its value...

37:50.281 --> 37:51.561
We forgot your dad.

37:52.201 --> 37:55.441
- We didn't buy anything for him. -
I'll go back another day.

37:56.681 --> 37:58.601
I'm going to meet the big boss.

37:59.281 --> 38:00.681
I'll bring him brandy next time.

38:01.121 --> 38:03.761
They're paying me 7,500. Then
they'll transfer me.

38:03.961 --> 38:05.601
It doesn't seem right.

38:07.241 --> 38:09.001
Times are tough.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.961
- They could have externalized.
- Of course.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.041
But your job is hard. You
should be paid well.

38:16.241 --> 38:17.761
I clean up. That's the deal.

38:17.961 --> 38:21.081
They pay me according to the results.

38:22.201 --> 38:25.281
I have to give them the
results they need.

38:26.281 --> 38:28.761
I don't know how you can trust them.

38:28.961 --> 38:30.001
I don't get it.

38:30.201 --> 38:31.601
Even if...

38:31.801 --> 38:34.201
even if they shut down the factory,

38:36.441 --> 38:37.841
they've guaranteed...

38:40.201 --> 38:42.081
that I'll get a hefty sum.

38:42.681 --> 38:44.041
- Are you sure? - Yes.

38:48.041 --> 38:49.121
Does that reassure you?

39:09.201 --> 39:10.641
- You know what? - What?

39:11.721 --> 39:13.921
What do you say we go somewhere...

39:14.481 --> 39:15.481
more private?

39:15.681 --> 39:17.641
You don't like it here?

39:18.081 --> 39:20.081
Have you ever had sex on a boat?

39:22.321 --> 39:24.641
I like getting fucked on the open sea.

39:25.721 --> 39:26.961
How about the bathroom?

39:28.841 --> 39:30.241
Isn't that kind of shady?

39:31.081 --> 39:32.761
I'm so horny. Aren't you?

39:34.361 --> 39:35.721
No, not this time.

39:50.361 --> 39:53.401
I'll be home late today,
I have class after work.

39:54.561 --> 39:56.801
Don't worry and tell mom
not to wait up.

40:00.361 --> 40:01.321
I understand.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.921
Do you want a little present?

40:08.001 --> 40:09.721
A very personal present.

40:26.921 --> 40:27.841
You're soaked.

40:31.761 --> 40:32.801
Excuse me.

40:34.001 --> 40:35.281
How are you, Alex?

40:36.561 --> 40:38.441
Yeah, I found it. It's great, huh?

40:40.641 --> 40:42.841
I have to go, we're about to dock.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.241
See you soon.

40:52.681 --> 40:54.641
If you want to call me someday.

41:02.361 --> 41:03.321
I found a great gift.

41:03.641 --> 41:04.441
What is it?

41:04.641 --> 41:08.041
A Stooges record, a first pressing.

41:08.241 --> 41:09.521
He'll love it.

41:09.721 --> 41:11.241
I found a place for the party.

41:11.681 --> 41:13.441
- Holy shit. - I'm sorry.

41:14.961 --> 41:16.921
I can't believe she just left.

41:17.481 --> 41:20.081
Yeah but... she's not bad.

41:20.881 --> 41:22.441
She looks like Matt's girlfriend.

41:22.721 --> 41:25.321
Help me instead of checking
out her ass.

41:28.201 --> 41:29.881
No need to check mine out.

41:30.081 --> 41:31.401
Sorry.

41:31.641 --> 41:32.761
Yeah, enjoy.

42:00.561 --> 42:02.281
Will you walk me to work?

42:03.601 --> 42:05.041
Can I see you tonight?

42:05.241 --> 42:06.441
You never give up.

42:08.361 --> 42:11.241
I want to make love to you for hours.

42:11.681 --> 42:13.681
I want you to scream with pleasure.

42:14.481 --> 42:15.521
Let me go.

42:16.721 --> 42:18.321
You couldn't care less.

42:19.961 --> 42:20.921
I'm touched.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.721
It's just that you think
about it all the time.

42:34.321 --> 42:35.841
What are you doing here?

42:36.361 --> 42:38.721
Mom? We were just going for a walk.

42:38.921 --> 42:41.681
- Good morning. - I thought
you were at work.

42:42.041 --> 42:43.921
- I was on my way there. - Sure.

42:44.401 --> 42:46.441
They have to change the pool water.

42:46.641 --> 42:47.601
What are you wearing?

42:48.281 --> 42:49.401
Stop, mom.

42:49.881 --> 42:52.081
- Let's go home. -
We didn't do anything.

42:52.281 --> 42:54.681
Did you hear me? If your
father knew...

42:55.001 --> 42:57.361
I don't care. I'm tired of...

42:57.601 --> 42:59.001
You're coming with me!

42:59.641 --> 43:00.721
Don't argue with me.

43:02.001 --> 43:03.201
You hit me.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.681
I saw her in the street with a guy.

43:06.881 --> 43:08.241
You can't imagine.

43:09.521 --> 43:12.281
I saw his eyes, the way
he looked at her.

43:16.041 --> 43:17.041
Alice?

43:20.561 --> 43:21.481
Can't you clean up?

43:22.481 --> 43:23.321
I did...

43:23.521 --> 43:26.441
You never listen. That's
why your mom's mad.

43:26.641 --> 43:28.121
I didn't do anything.

43:30.321 --> 43:31.921
Do you remember what I said?

43:41.241 --> 43:42.641
The young men here

43:43.281 --> 43:44.601
waited for the Krauts...

43:44.801 --> 43:45.761
The Germans.

43:46.201 --> 43:47.681
They massacred them.

43:47.961 --> 43:50.281
Your grandfather stood at the window.

43:51.201 --> 43:54.121
The only thing that idiot managed
to do was to be seen.

43:54.321 --> 43:57.561
The Krauts, the Germans, found him
and they took revenge.

43:58.081 --> 44:00.681
They killed him in front
of his pregnant wife.

44:01.561 --> 44:04.361
He was young, not even 25 years old.

44:05.721 --> 44:07.601
But he was an honest man.

44:07.801 --> 44:10.921
He married your grandmother
when she got pregnant.

44:11.121 --> 44:12.161
Dad...

44:17.041 --> 44:19.401
Not all men are like your grandfather.

44:22.481 --> 44:23.401
I know.

44:26.281 --> 44:28.801
How about we find you an apartment?

44:29.721 --> 44:31.361
But promise me something.

44:32.401 --> 44:33.681
Promise you'll call us.

44:34.201 --> 44:35.921
But what will mom say?

44:36.241 --> 44:39.281
You heard her. She's scared for you.

44:39.721 --> 44:42.961
She forgot how she and I used
to meet secretly.

44:44.321 --> 44:47.481
Her parents could never
have stopped us.

44:49.681 --> 44:51.041
- Don't worry. - I do worry.

44:52.401 --> 44:54.321
You know, sweetie,

44:55.921 --> 44:57.761
we don't know what will happen.

45:04.441 --> 45:06.001
What are you doing in the rain?

45:06.201 --> 45:08.081
Nothing. We were about to leave.

45:10.481 --> 45:12.121
I feel like fucking.

45:13.241 --> 45:14.241
Right now?

45:14.441 --> 45:16.961
No, with a guy I met on the
boat from England.

45:17.281 --> 45:19.041
Can I have the joint, Alex?

45:25.921 --> 45:28.161
I'm going to sell the copper.

45:39.961 --> 45:40.721
Touch me.

45:40.961 --> 45:41.841
That's enough.

45:42.881 --> 45:44.561
You and Alex could fuck me.

45:46.081 --> 45:47.561
Don't go too far, ok?

45:47.761 --> 45:49.761
I like it when you're like this.

45:52.281 --> 45:53.521
I'm sorry.

45:54.681 --> 45:55.961
Just take it easy.

45:57.721 --> 45:59.361
What do you expect?

45:59.841 --> 46:01.321
- Of whom? - Of me.

46:01.841 --> 46:02.721
Nothing.

46:05.241 --> 46:07.041
Do I surprise you sometimes?

46:08.121 --> 46:08.761
Never.

46:10.681 --> 46:12.281
You deserve a spanking.

46:12.481 --> 46:15.241
That's exactly what turns me on.
Spank me.

46:18.601 --> 46:19.681
Let's sell the copper.

46:20.641 --> 46:22.001
- Let's go. - Come on.

46:40.361 --> 46:42.801
That girl on the boat was cute.

46:43.361 --> 46:44.721
What girl on the boat?

46:44.921 --> 46:46.441
You know who I mean.

46:47.961 --> 46:49.481
She was really pretty.

46:49.761 --> 46:51.201
I didn't notice.

46:52.161 --> 46:53.881
She was sitting next to us.

46:54.761 --> 46:57.241
When we left the port, she
dropped her bag.

46:57.761 --> 46:58.961
Oh, that one.

47:00.881 --> 47:02.521
She was cute.

47:06.081 --> 47:07.361
Are you going to bed?

47:07.801 --> 47:09.041
I want to watch a movie.

47:10.121 --> 47:11.521
I didn't say "to sleep".

47:14.001 --> 47:15.441
You know I can't.

47:15.641 --> 47:17.481
It's all in your head.

47:20.641 --> 47:21.801
I'm sorry.

47:22.801 --> 47:23.881
Not yet.

47:24.201 --> 47:25.321
I'm not ready yet.

47:31.041 --> 47:31.761
Are you sure?

47:34.201 --> 47:35.441
What if...

47:39.121 --> 47:40.921
I'd fucked her in the bathroom?

47:42.441 --> 47:43.881
You're such a pervert.

47:51.441 --> 47:53.041
Did she turn you on?

47:53.561 --> 47:54.361
Yes.

47:57.401 --> 47:59.161
Do you want to do her?

48:05.721 --> 48:07.041
In front of you.

48:07.241 --> 48:08.361
In front of me?

48:15.761 --> 48:18.641
You'd have to watch her
giving me a blow job.

48:22.841 --> 48:24.721
She'd go down on you.

48:26.241 --> 48:27.361
She'd make you come.

48:28.761 --> 48:31.081
And I'd watch you do her

48:32.961 --> 48:34.041
like a bitch,

48:34.521 --> 48:35.801
on all fours.

48:38.201 --> 48:40.761
I'd take her in the ass, hard.

48:43.721 --> 48:47.361
I'd see your cock disappear
into her ass.

48:52.121 --> 48:53.761
The more she'd scream,

48:54.841 --> 48:56.801
the harder I'd do her.

48:57.321 --> 48:58.601
Until...

48:59.081 --> 49:00.801
until you came.

49:01.561 --> 49:03.441
Until I covered her in cum.

49:26.761 --> 49:28.001
I'm fine.

49:30.081 --> 49:31.201
Let me be.

49:32.801 --> 49:34.041
Please.

49:53.561 --> 49:54.961
It's really nice of you.

49:55.161 --> 49:57.521
It was Cecile's idea to call everyone.

49:57.721 --> 50:00.041
- Of course. - You won't
forget your 26th.

50:01.241 --> 50:02.561
Don't be a bore.

50:03.601 --> 50:05.161
We're really near the water.

50:06.161 --> 50:07.481
Why do you wanna go there?

50:07.681 --> 50:09.001
What are you doing?

50:09.361 --> 50:11.241
- We were waiting for you.
- Very funny.

50:12.561 --> 50:14.201
It's a friend's birthday.

50:14.721 --> 50:16.201
Will you stay with us?

50:16.801 --> 50:18.321
If you stay with me.

50:28.521 --> 50:30.801
Don't take advantage of me. I'm drunk.

50:37.321 --> 50:38.721
And your girlfriend?

50:40.121 --> 50:41.961
What girlfriend? Alice?

50:42.841 --> 50:44.881
She runs off when I touch her.

50:45.081 --> 50:46.881
You're still thinking about her.

50:49.361 --> 50:50.601
I don't know.

50:51.121 --> 50:52.201
I'm lost.

50:55.041 --> 50:57.361
The thing is that you make me hard.

50:57.841 --> 50:59.521
I can't stop thinking of you.

51:00.041 --> 51:01.321
Of my little ass?

51:03.441 --> 51:06.001
- Do you wanna swim? - No,
it's too cold.

51:07.121 --> 51:08.121
How about a swim?

51:08.321 --> 51:10.481
There we go. What was I saying?

51:10.681 --> 51:11.601
Yeah, let's go.

51:15.241 --> 51:16.521
I want you.

51:16.841 --> 51:18.001
- Now? - Yes.

51:18.401 --> 51:20.521
- Right now. - You never stop.

51:22.241 --> 51:25.041
You drive me crazy.
I don't understand.

51:25.761 --> 51:26.961
I can't take it any more.

51:31.801 --> 51:33.401
We're going to swim!

51:41.081 --> 51:42.881
Wait for me. I'll be back.

53:04.361 --> 53:05.361
Come here.

53:17.761 --> 53:18.921
Harder.

53:19.881 --> 53:21.281
Hurt me.

53:25.761 --> 53:27.161
Fuck me hard.

53:29.681 --> 53:30.481
Fuck me!

53:30.721 --> 53:31.841
I'll tear you apart.

53:40.841 --> 53:41.961
Hit me.

53:44.041 --> 53:44.801
Again.

53:46.921 --> 53:47.601
Come on.

53:49.241 --> 53:50.121
Again!

53:50.361 --> 53:51.321
Harder.

54:22.801 --> 54:24.161
I don't feel anything.

55:37.721 --> 55:41.441
Héloise almost said yes
to the pictures.

55:44.001 --> 55:45.681
I really want to see Sonia.

55:45.881 --> 55:49.241
Who cares? I'm sure she
already regrets it.

55:49.441 --> 55:51.081
I want to know where she is.

55:58.881 --> 56:00.841
We do some strange stuff.

56:01.041 --> 56:03.801
This guy called once. He'd
dialed the wrong number.

56:04.001 --> 56:05.561
That always happens to me.

56:05.761 --> 56:09.401
He turned me on because he had
a very sexy voice.

56:09.961 --> 56:10.921
He got you all wet.

56:11.121 --> 56:13.121
Don't be so vulgar.

56:13.321 --> 56:15.121
Leave us alone. Go on.

56:15.321 --> 56:18.201
The first time, we talked for a while

56:18.401 --> 56:22.201
and just before hanging up, he asked
if he could call me back.

56:22.841 --> 56:23.761
You didn't!

56:24.161 --> 56:27.241
I can't believe you. What
about your boyfriend?

56:27.441 --> 56:29.201
He never found out.

56:29.401 --> 56:30.881
He kept calling me

56:31.081 --> 56:33.681
then I started missing him
when he didn't call.

56:33.881 --> 56:35.841
- But I didn't want to call him.
- Why?

56:36.041 --> 56:38.081
I'd rather he called me.

56:38.281 --> 56:39.921
That's what turned me on.

56:41.721 --> 56:45.841
We talked about lots of things,
especially about sex.

56:46.481 --> 56:48.041
You were scammed.

56:48.241 --> 56:49.801
Let her talk.

56:50.001 --> 56:52.241
Tell us what happened.

56:52.441 --> 56:55.241
We planned to meet at that hotel in
front of the station.

56:55.441 --> 56:56.801
The Select Hotel?

56:57.001 --> 56:58.601
I thought it was for whores.

56:58.801 --> 57:00.561
No, it's a decent hotel.

57:01.041 --> 57:03.441
He gave me very precise instructions.

57:03.641 --> 57:08.521
I had to wait for him in bed,
naked and on my stomach.

57:10.441 --> 57:11.401
Did he come?

57:11.601 --> 57:13.041
He was very delicate.

57:13.241 --> 57:14.161
You didn't...

57:14.361 --> 57:15.241
Did you do it?

57:15.441 --> 57:18.721
He took his time, he was so gentle.
He was very good.

57:18.921 --> 57:19.881
It was incredible.

57:20.081 --> 57:23.561
I felt like my body had been needing
that for a long time.

57:23.881 --> 57:27.401
And the fact that I couldn't see him
turned me on even more.

57:27.601 --> 57:29.961
In the end, he took me in the ass.

57:30.441 --> 57:31.441
Didn't it hurt?

57:31.641 --> 57:32.921
That's disgusting.

57:33.121 --> 57:35.361
If the guy wants to, I let him.

57:35.561 --> 57:37.761
They're all secretly gay.

57:38.361 --> 57:40.401
But I liked it. It was different.

57:40.601 --> 57:43.361
The pleasure was more violent
than making love.

57:44.081 --> 57:45.801
Stop, you're turning me on.

57:47.561 --> 57:48.841
So what happened to him?

57:49.041 --> 57:50.641
He never called again.

57:55.601 --> 57:58.121
I'm really confused, Sonia.

57:58.321 --> 57:59.841
We can't go on like this.

58:00.281 --> 58:03.161
We have to talk. Don't you think so?
Hello?

58:03.921 --> 58:05.321
Fucking voice-mail!

58:05.521 --> 58:07.441
I was in class.

58:07.681 --> 58:09.081
Can you wait for me?

58:09.401 --> 58:11.241
Yeah, I know where it is.

58:17.761 --> 58:19.961
I'll fire them and send them a check.

58:20.161 --> 58:22.001
Do you think it'll calm them down?

58:27.441 --> 58:29.201
No, not really.

58:31.361 --> 58:34.121
I'm sitting outside, at a café,
like we planned.

58:36.001 --> 58:37.361
Can you hear me?

58:37.561 --> 58:40.441
I said I'm... I did what you
asked me to do.

58:42.401 --> 58:44.241
I'm not wearing panties.

58:45.921 --> 58:47.361
I can't believe I did that.

58:47.561 --> 58:49.281
Yes, I'm outside. Come over.

58:49.481 --> 58:51.121
You wanted a bottle, right?

58:51.321 --> 58:53.041
I brought some makeup too.

58:54.841 --> 58:57.161
No, not for my pussy. Don't be silly.

58:58.441 --> 58:59.361
Ok.

58:59.761 --> 59:01.841
I've left you 25 messages.

59:02.441 --> 59:03.441
25.

59:03.841 --> 59:05.281
You never answer.

59:06.841 --> 59:08.921
I just want to talk to you.

59:12.561 --> 59:14.921
You can't just leave like that

59:15.521 --> 59:17.401
and not talk to me any more.

59:19.201 --> 59:20.841
It's awful.

59:22.281 --> 59:24.401
We're better than that, Sonia.

59:24.841 --> 59:26.241
You know it.

59:26.921 --> 59:28.721
I'm begging you, call me back.

59:29.001 --> 59:32.161
It's getting worse and worse.

59:32.361 --> 59:33.761
Do you have time to meet up?

59:34.401 --> 59:36.721
No, but they're exhausted.

59:37.801 --> 59:39.041
You can't come?

59:39.241 --> 59:41.001
I'm in front of the café.

59:41.761 --> 59:42.761
Where are you?

59:52.481 --> 59:54.161
You can't keep calling me.

59:54.361 --> 59:55.721
I have to talk to you.

59:55.921 --> 59:56.641
I have to...

59:56.841 --> 59:58.161
All right, but later.

01:00:05.801 --> 01:00:07.401
I have customers. I can't talk.

01:00:07.641 --> 01:00:08.801
You're busy?

01:00:13.481 --> 01:00:15.001
I'd like to see you.

01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:18.081
I have to work. I can't
talk right now.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.841
I have to go, ok? 'Bye.

01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:32.441
Could you take out the Peugeot later?

01:00:32.641 --> 01:00:33.641
No problem.

01:00:35.561 --> 01:00:38.561
No need to come in tomorrow,
there's nothing to do.

01:00:39.121 --> 01:00:41.281
I know but I'll come anyway.

01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:42.561
If you want to.

01:01:03.241 --> 01:01:04.801
- Who is it? - Guess.

01:01:05.641 --> 01:01:08.161
- I don't like riddles. - Too bad.

01:01:08.361 --> 01:01:09.681
I waited all night long.

01:01:09.881 --> 01:01:12.881
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry but
I couldn't make it.

01:01:13.121 --> 01:01:14.161
Why not?

01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:16.081
What's going on?

01:01:17.961 --> 01:01:19.161
Turn around.

01:01:19.361 --> 01:01:20.081
Here?

01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:21.881
I don't care. Turn around.

01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:31.281
You're not doing well.

01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:32.561
Shut up.

01:01:33.841 --> 01:01:34.801
Wait.

01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:37.201
I'll help you.

01:01:58.721 --> 01:02:00.681
Can't you see it's not working?

01:02:30.201 --> 01:02:31.441
Stop, it hurts.

01:02:39.921 --> 01:02:41.441
I don't understand you.

01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:43.001
Can I have your keys?

01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:46.601
What for?

01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:48.041
Don't you want to fuck?

01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:49.601
Not at my place.

01:02:50.001 --> 01:02:51.281
You're complicated.

01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:52.441
What about you?

01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:56.481
You show up and you disappear.

01:02:57.601 --> 01:02:59.801
I was with someone better before you.

01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:01.361
I don't understand you.

01:03:01.601 --> 01:03:03.161
You don't know how to love.

01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:05.601
You've become boring.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.681
I liked you better impotent.

01:03:07.881 --> 01:03:09.041
Leave me alone.

01:03:09.561 --> 01:03:11.001
What's wrong with you?

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:14.281
I got it.

01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:18.241
Your stairs are such a pain.

01:05:18.441 --> 01:05:20.361
I'm sorry but I didn't make them.

01:05:20.561 --> 01:05:21.281
Shit.

01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:25.721
Everyone's nuts, especially the guys.
Did you notice?

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:28.361
It's fear of unemployment.

01:05:29.121 --> 01:05:30.601
You know what?

01:05:31.521 --> 01:05:33.801
I caught mine jerking off in his car.

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:36.521
Mine's become obsessed with sex.

01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:39.441
He wanted to do it in the
hallway of my building.

01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.601
- That's nice. - He just had to fuck.

01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.681
At least he's original.

01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:45.961
Now you show up? Where were you?

01:05:46.161 --> 01:05:48.041
Sorry, I had job interviews.

01:05:48.241 --> 01:05:48.921
There you are.

01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:50.841
Let's hurry, they're watching.

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:54.361
We're not taking the heavy stuff.
Leave it up there.

01:05:54.561 --> 01:05:56.401
I won't leave my landlord anything.

01:05:57.761 --> 01:05:59.881
My guy said this stuff
while we fucked.

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.081
It turned me on.

01:06:01.281 --> 01:06:02.161
What did he say?

01:06:02.361 --> 01:06:03.681
He pretended

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.281
I was getting paid to fuck.

01:06:05.481 --> 01:06:07.641
It wasn't original but
it did the trick.

01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:10.081
It's original for some people.

01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:12.721
No, my ex gave that to me.

01:06:12.961 --> 01:06:13.761
Thanks.

01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:15.001
Which one?

01:06:15.801 --> 01:06:18.521
I hate it. Now I can finally
get rid of it.

01:06:23.161 --> 01:06:25.601
It's the super.

01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:26.921
Quiet.

01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:31.361
Alizée, would you get fucked
in front of your boyfriend?

01:06:31.561 --> 01:06:32.921
C)h, no. I couldn't.

01:06:34.321 --> 01:06:36.801
But I wouldn't mind
doing it for money.

01:06:37.001 --> 01:06:38.401
Guys think up weird stuff.

01:06:38.601 --> 01:06:41.721
Getting paid to fuck is kind
of a boring fantasy.

01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:44.721
Given the situation, I'm
starting to think about it.

01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:46.361
Why not get paid to fuck?

01:06:46.721 --> 01:06:52.041
It's like that unemployed guy in the
movie who becomes a Chippendale.

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.481
Just for one night.

01:06:53.681 --> 01:06:55.041
Does it work in the movie?

01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:56.081
Totally.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:07:00.601
Even if they pay me, I'm sorry but I
get to choose who I fuck.

01:07:00.801 --> 01:07:02.481
And we don't bring the guys.

01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:05.521
- Is the super still there?
- I'll go and see.

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:10.081
- He won't budge. - Can we get
out the window?

01:07:12.321 --> 01:07:15.001
- I don't think so. - That's
not good news.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.921
Anyway, all guys are pigs.

01:09:10.081 --> 01:09:12.881
- You're kind of butch, aren't you?
- So what?

01:09:13.201 --> 01:09:16.361
Guys are very interesting
between ten and midnight.

01:09:16.921 --> 01:09:18.321
They should be gentler.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.321
I like getting tied down.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.281
Tied down with a rope?

01:09:22.481 --> 01:09:23.921
Isn't it humiliating?

01:09:24.121 --> 01:09:25.961
Please! Try it out, you'll see.

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.961
- At least we can't fake it. - True.

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:31.281
- You fake it? - Sometimes
you have to.

01:09:31.481 --> 01:09:35.161
Once, I was so tired I had to fake it
so he'd let me sleep.

01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:38.241
They forget we're not sex machines.

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:41.560
If I don't feel like it,
I kick him out of bed.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:45.560
Now with the strike, they'll
have more time for sex.

01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:50.081
Dream on. All they care about is the
size of their dicks!

01:10:00.681 --> 01:10:01.801
It's just a phone

01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:05.681
but it's also a camera, a laptop, the
internet, everything.

01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:08.321
It's an absolute must-have.

01:10:08.761 --> 01:10:11.521
Are you traveling for
pleasure or for business?

01:10:11.721 --> 01:10:13.241
Do you have a cigarette?

01:10:13.801 --> 01:10:15.161
Do you want to come on deck with me?

01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:17.681
Why can't we stay here?

01:10:18.801 --> 01:10:20.721
You can't smoke on boats any more.

01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:22.921
You can't smoke anywhere any more.

01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:24.081
Ok, wrong answer.

01:10:24.281 --> 01:10:25.521
Excuse me,

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.561
do you have a cigarette?

01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:31.481
I even have a lighter.

01:10:32.681 --> 01:10:35.241
And here's my card.

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.321
You can't smoke here.

01:10:40.521 --> 01:10:44.641
If I only did what's allowed, life
would be sad, wouldn't it?

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.321
- Don't you think so? - I agree.

01:10:52.921 --> 01:10:54.601
How would you like to...

01:10:57.361 --> 01:10:58.561
light...

01:10:59.401 --> 01:11:00.921
my cigarette...

01:11:01.401 --> 01:11:02.561
in the bathroom?

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:05.441
Ok.

01:11:07.321 --> 01:11:09.121
You go first. I'll join you in five.

01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:23.321
There are two possibilities.

01:11:23.681 --> 01:11:25.241
He might realize what we did

01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:27.121
and we'll have 5 min to run.

01:11:28.481 --> 01:11:29.761
If he's madly in love,

01:11:29.961 --> 01:11:32.241
he'll wait until we get to the port.

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.681
I have nothing to do with this.

01:11:34.881 --> 01:11:36.201
Is that so?

01:12:09.001 --> 01:12:09.961
Come in here.

01:12:10.161 --> 01:12:12.601
It's not very cozy but
we'll be left alone.

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:29.721
Do you smoke?

01:12:31.961 --> 01:12:33.921
Do you often go to England?

01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:37.601
I buy clothes there. How's that
for an answer?

01:12:38.201 --> 01:12:39.841
Come on, chill out.

01:12:41.801 --> 01:12:44.881
I hadn't planned on traveling
in the bathroom either.

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.041
Even in very good company.

01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:51.361
What's your deal? You like
to scam people?

01:12:51.561 --> 01:12:53.521
Or do you just like robbing them?

01:12:57.041 --> 01:12:58.361
You're pretty.

01:12:59.201 --> 01:13:01.121
Don't change the subject.

01:13:01.801 --> 01:13:03.921
You just need to get this
ridiculous thing off.

01:13:04.121 --> 01:13:05.121
I can't see.

01:13:05.361 --> 01:13:06.601
Leave me alone.

01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:12.201
You've got two choices.

01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:24.681
Do you ever stop? Do you
like turning men on?

01:13:24.881 --> 01:13:25.961
Why men?

01:13:27.841 --> 01:13:29.481
They're so predictable.

01:13:34.241 --> 01:13:37.321
Haven't you ever wanted to fuck
just like that, for fun?

01:13:37.841 --> 01:13:39.481
No, I never talk about that.

01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:41.881
I don't want to talk about that.

01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:43.241
Not like this.

01:13:49.161 --> 01:13:51.241
Don't you ever think of...

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:53.521
very nasty things,

01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:54.801
dirty things...

01:13:57.641 --> 01:13:59.241
things that turn you on?

01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:04.281
Tell me what you think about.

01:14:06.641 --> 01:14:09.801
We might never see each other again.

01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:15.641
Guys...

01:14:21.561 --> 01:14:23.881
they know exactly how
to explain that...

01:14:25.481 --> 01:14:28.881
pleasure has nothing to do with love.

01:14:30.241 --> 01:14:32.201
- What do you want? - What about you?

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:39.201
Stop.

01:14:41.481 --> 01:14:44.521
I'm sure you're all wet
between your legs.

01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:52.321
Come on, don't worry. I'm
just gonna touch you.

01:14:59.681 --> 01:15:01.041
What are you doing?

01:15:04.201 --> 01:15:06.361
How long have you gone
without fucking?

01:15:06.561 --> 01:15:08.041
Did you caress yourself?

01:15:09.361 --> 01:15:10.361
No.

01:15:14.401 --> 01:15:15.361
Yes.

01:15:16.921 --> 01:15:18.201
I..-

01:15:20.121 --> 01:15:21.521
I touched myself.

01:15:28.841 --> 01:15:30.481
What did you think of?

01:15:32.441 --> 01:15:33.681
I don't know.

01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:44.361
A cock.

01:15:46.761 --> 01:15:48.201
Matt

01:15:49.081 --> 01:15:50.761
making love to me.

01:16:01.321 --> 01:16:02.241
Open your legs.

01:16:03.201 --> 01:16:04.201
No.

01:16:05.001 --> 01:16:06.241
I can't.

01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:08.721
What's stopping you?

01:16:09.801 --> 01:16:11.121
I'm not like that.

01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:38.561
Look. You're beautiful.

01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:41.921
Look.

01:16:50.601 --> 01:16:51.961
Tell me you like it.

01:18:19.641 --> 01:18:20.841
My cell phone!

01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:22.001
You stole my phone.

01:18:22.441 --> 01:18:25.201
You hit on me as soon as I sat down!

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:27.161
Have a look, sir.

01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:28.841
She has an accomplice.

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:30.121
Sure she does...

01:18:30.321 --> 01:18:32.361
I'm sorry, miss. Let's go
to the station.

01:18:33.161 --> 01:18:35.161
- But she... - We'll go and explain.

01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:37.201
But she stole my phone.

01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:40.001
We'll see about that. Come with me.

01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:14.321
Cécile?

01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:16.561
I don't know if you recognize me.

01:19:16.761 --> 01:19:17.801
No.

01:19:18.001 --> 01:19:19.481
Oh, yes.

01:19:20.241 --> 01:19:21.641
I'm sorry to bother you

01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:24.361
but my husband said you'd
be here today.

01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:26.361
What exactly do you want?

01:19:26.921 --> 01:19:29.961
Yves talks a lot about you and I
wanted to see you.

01:19:30.561 --> 01:19:31.801
So?

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:35.121
I know it's stupid.

01:19:35.361 --> 01:19:36.321
I'm sorry, never mind.

01:19:36.521 --> 01:19:38.881
No, wait. Come back.

01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:46.041
It's silly. I haven't seen
anyone in 6 months.

01:19:48.161 --> 01:19:49.961
I'm glad you came.

01:19:51.401 --> 01:19:53.241
He talks about you to me too

01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:55.361
and he's right, you're beautiful.

01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:57.881
So are you.

01:19:59.521 --> 01:20:01.001
I'm happy to see you.

01:20:02.121 --> 01:20:03.161
I love him, you know.

01:20:15.761 --> 01:20:17.681
Mr. Daniel!

01:20:18.761 --> 01:20:20.281
What happened?

01:20:21.161 --> 01:20:23.161
I'm ok. I just need to sit down.

01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:24.921
Are you sure?

01:20:25.481 --> 01:20:26.881
What can I do?

01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:30.561
Please don't mention it.

01:20:30.761 --> 01:20:33.201
You should really see a doctor.

01:20:34.481 --> 01:20:38.121
I'm a toilet cleaner to you, but
I had another life.

01:20:38.321 --> 01:20:40.201
I don't see you like that.

01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:43.161
I had great love stories...

01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:44.801
with women...

01:20:47.201 --> 01:20:48.921
With wonderful women.

01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:52.241
And then, I got married...

01:20:53.521 --> 01:20:55.121
with a woman who was so...

01:20:56.721 --> 01:20:57.841
she was...

01:21:00.601 --> 01:21:01.841
and then when she...

01:21:03.521 --> 01:21:04.961
When she left,

01:21:06.481 --> 01:21:07.961
I knew it was over.

01:21:09.321 --> 01:21:11.441
I haven't touched a woman in...

01:21:14.081 --> 01:21:15.761
in 25 years.

01:22:19.161 --> 01:22:20.481
<i>Permanently Closed</i>

01:22:32.521 --> 01:22:35.721
So, what's the deal? What are
you gonna do exactly?

01:22:35.921 --> 01:22:38.721
I thought we were here
to talk about us.

01:22:39.441 --> 01:22:42.241
- So it's none of my business?
- That depends.

01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:44.441
You girls are weird,

01:22:44.921 --> 01:22:45.881
aren't you?

01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:48.441
So I'm not allowed to join in?

01:22:49.761 --> 01:22:51.641
If you want to pay, why not?

01:22:52.641 --> 01:22:56.601
Let me see if I understand. If
I want to screw you,

01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.161
I have to pay?

01:22:58.361 --> 01:22:59.121
Dream on.

01:22:59.361 --> 01:23:01.321
I didn't say I wanted to fuck you.

01:23:07.121 --> 01:23:09.441
Sonia, I know I messed up.

01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:11.281
Now you realize it?

01:23:14.961 --> 01:23:17.081
I should've taken better care of you.

01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:19.241
I didn't pay enough attention.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.281
Stop it.

01:23:23.201 --> 01:23:24.081
How are you?

01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:25.361
Fine.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.561
I'm surprised you called.

01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:30.401
And I'm surprised you kept that
jerk's cell phone.

01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:35.761
I have a favor to ask you.

01:23:35.961 --> 01:23:37.201
What kind of favor?

01:23:37.641 --> 01:23:39.561
It's kind of strange.

01:23:40.721 --> 01:23:42.441
Not another fantasy...

01:23:43.321 --> 01:23:44.601
I didn't make you come.

01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:45.881
Ok, stop.

01:23:46.081 --> 01:23:47.201
If you want me to.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:55.281
I don't think we should have
met up again.

01:23:57.321 --> 01:23:58.881
Do you want to get out?

01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:09.441
Ok, let's go.

01:24:10.401 --> 01:24:13.161
- I miss you, it's too hard. - Stop.

01:24:14.401 --> 01:24:15.601
Honestly,

01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:19.601
I think about you all the time. I
can't live without you.

01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:22.561
Now you tell me?

01:24:23.121 --> 01:24:24.321
Now you tell me?

01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:27.441
I can't be away from you. Please stop,
Sonia.

01:24:27.641 --> 01:24:29.521
I'll prove my love to you every day.

01:24:29.721 --> 01:24:33.201
What made you realize that? The
fact that I left you?

01:24:48.521 --> 01:24:51.041
- Hi, I'm looking for Alice.
- She's not here.

01:24:51.481 --> 01:24:53.961
- How long ago did she leave?
- I don't know.

01:24:54.161 --> 01:24:56.161
What do you mean you don't know?

01:24:56.361 --> 01:24:58.201
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

01:25:29.241 --> 01:25:30.481
I killed a guy.

01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:31.881
You don't know that.

01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:35.361
He wasn't moving. He was lying
there like a dog.

01:25:36.121 --> 01:25:38.161
What have I done? Shit!

01:25:38.361 --> 01:25:40.161
You have to call the hospital.

01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:43.481
I keep screwing up since
Sonia left me.

01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:45.801
All I do is mess up.

01:25:46.001 --> 01:25:48.721
I stole a car and I hit a guy.
Can you imagine?

01:25:49.601 --> 01:25:50.761
Did you use your tool?

01:25:51.601 --> 01:25:53.401
I stole an amazing car.

01:25:54.601 --> 01:25:55.881
That's all.

01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:59.561
Go back to where it happened.

01:25:59.761 --> 01:26:01.521
Are you crazy? I can't.

01:26:03.961 --> 01:26:06.321
Go home and calm down, ok?

01:26:06.521 --> 01:26:08.281
I'll take care of it, ok?

01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:10.241
Calm down, ok?

01:26:29.521 --> 01:26:32.801
Did you just get hit by a car?
Are you ok?

01:26:33.001 --> 01:26:34.681
Yeah. Leave me alone.

01:26:35.561 --> 01:26:36.801
Let's go to hospital.

01:26:37.001 --> 01:26:38.881
I'm fine.

01:26:39.081 --> 01:26:40.361
I said I'm fine.

01:26:41.441 --> 01:26:43.481
Weren't you at my birthday party?

01:26:44.561 --> 01:26:46.881
You're Cécile's pseudo boyfriend.

01:26:47.081 --> 01:26:48.801
What are you talking about?

01:26:49.081 --> 01:26:52.241
How about you shut up? You're
getting on my nerves.

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:56.361
Right, so your chick doesn't have a
boyfriend either. Jerk.

01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:59.361
You've just been crashed
into by a car.

01:26:59.561 --> 01:27:02.081
That's the only reason
I won't beat you up.

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:06.001
If that's what it's like
to love someone,

01:27:07.441 --> 01:27:09.961
you deserve each other.
You're both jerks.

01:27:15.241 --> 01:27:17.481
I'm taking you to a wonderful place.

01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:26.441
It's a house that was lent to me.

01:27:28.121 --> 01:27:29.401
You'll go in alone.

01:27:30.001 --> 01:27:31.521
I won't go with you.

01:27:36.281 --> 01:27:40.601
You'll take the scarf and the hood
that are on a table in the entrance.

01:27:43.801 --> 01:27:46.521
Someone will come. You will
let her in.

01:27:54.121 --> 01:27:55.321
Is it here?

01:27:56.641 --> 01:27:58.681
You have to wait over there.

01:28:02.001 --> 01:28:03.961
I have to blindfold you.

01:28:04.561 --> 01:28:06.041
Oh right, the blindfold.

01:28:15.961 --> 01:28:18.161
- I have to open the door. - Yes,
of course.

01:28:21.521 --> 01:28:23.441
It's my first time, you know?

01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:26.761
He won't hurt me, will he?

01:28:27.481 --> 01:28:30.121
Could you ask him not to be violent?

01:28:31.801 --> 01:28:34.481
It's the first time I've done
anything like this.

01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:38.201
<i>You will let in the second person
and put the hood on him.</i>

01:28:38.401 --> 01:28:39.441
- Hello. - Hello.

01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:41.601
<i>They can '2' talk to each other.</i>

01:28:41.801 --> 01:28:42.601
Can I come in?

01:28:43.441 --> 01:28:45.961
Yes, but I have to put this on you.

01:28:49.441 --> 01:28:51.601
<i>You'll uncover the woman's breasts.</i>

01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:55.201
<i>Then you'll push the man
towards the woman.</i>

01:29:02.681 --> 01:29:04.801
<i>You'll help them to make love.</i>

01:29:05.001 --> 01:29:06.081
<i>I can't do that.</i>

01:29:06.321 --> 01:29:07.721
You can't or you won't?

01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:10.321
- I couldn't. - I'm not asking
you to fuck.

01:29:12.081 --> 01:29:13.641
- But I can't... - Yes, you are.

01:29:13.841 --> 01:29:15.161
It's like on the boat,

01:29:15.401 --> 01:29:16.881
when you saw me stealing.

01:29:18.481 --> 01:29:19.481
You like taking risks.

01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:21.241
No I don't.

01:29:21.441 --> 01:29:22.441
Didn't you like it

01:29:22.641 --> 01:29:27.081
when they stopped you and you
managed to trick them?

01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:31.081
Why me?

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:37.841
Because I'm sure you can do it.

01:29:42.881 --> 01:29:46.281
I'd bet my tongue on it! Trust me.

01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:24.561
You're awful.

01:30:24.761 --> 01:30:27.201
Why? I just did them a favor.

01:30:27.961 --> 01:30:29.321
She was pushing herself.

01:30:30.681 --> 01:30:33.161
Why are you so aggressive with me?

01:30:34.401 --> 01:30:35.761
I'm sorry.

01:30:36.161 --> 01:30:37.521
You're forgiven.

01:30:38.401 --> 01:30:40.561
What about her husband?

01:30:40.761 --> 01:30:42.481
Don't you get it?

01:30:42.681 --> 01:30:43.481
What?

01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:46.561
The blindfold so they couldn't
see each other...

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:50.081
It was her husband who just
had sex with her.

01:30:51.161 --> 01:30:52.681
Did he know?

01:30:53.361 --> 01:30:54.801
Of course not.

01:30:55.761 --> 01:30:57.121
I don't get it.

01:30:57.801 --> 01:31:00.241
The young woman, Virginie,

01:31:00.641 --> 01:31:03.681
had a bad experience a few months ago

01:31:03.881 --> 01:31:06.041
and she needed to feel pleasure again,

01:31:06.801 --> 01:31:08.441
without feeling guilty.

01:31:10.401 --> 01:31:11.761
I'm sorry.

01:31:14.761 --> 01:31:16.001
Not this time.

01:31:18.401 --> 01:31:21.761
From now on, when you behave badly,
I'll give you a dare.

01:31:25.201 --> 01:31:26.441
Do YOU agree?

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:28.561
Ok?

01:31:29.641 --> 01:31:30.361
Yes.

01:31:31.281 --> 01:31:32.241
Alright.

01:31:32.841 --> 01:31:34.921
You'll go to this address.

01:31:42.321 --> 01:31:43.321
Now.

01:32:17.481 --> 01:32:20.561
<i>You'll undress and you'll
sit on the bed.</i>

01:32:22.441 --> 01:32:24.641
<i>A man will come and
you'll welcome him.</i>

01:32:26.001 --> 01:32:27.961
<i>Yes, I want you to wait for him,</i>

01:32:28.521 --> 01:32:29.921
<i>naked on the bed.</i>

01:32:54.561 --> 01:32:56.121
<i>I don't know if I can.</i>

01:32:57.041 --> 01:32:58.401
Yes, you can.

01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:02.201
Hi, Cécile.

01:33:02.401 --> 01:33:03.881
I have to go.

01:33:04.081 --> 01:33:06.361
So what's this crazy idea?

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:16.041
But still, to make them pay...

01:33:16.921 --> 01:33:19.441
They fuck us as if
we belonged to them.

01:33:19.641 --> 01:33:24.241
They pay and we get to choose.
It's heaven, isn't it?

01:33:24.441 --> 01:33:27.361
And with this money, we can even
help the strikers.

01:33:28.241 --> 01:33:30.241
Yeah, we'll see.

01:33:30.721 --> 01:33:31.721
So, shall we?

01:33:33.201 --> 01:33:35.361
Cécile, you're crazy.

01:33:35.561 --> 01:33:37.921
And so are we, for following you.

01:33:38.841 --> 01:33:40.081
Are you ready?

01:33:41.361 --> 01:33:42.561
They're here,

01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:44.281
they're waiting,

01:33:45.601 --> 01:33:46.921
they've paid.

01:33:47.961 --> 01:33:49.641
Now we have to choose.

01:35:06.921 --> 01:35:08.201
Alice?

01:36:04.961 --> 01:36:07.321
Will you give me a special price?

01:36:08.401 --> 01:36:09.321
No.

01:36:09.881 --> 01:36:11.321
For you, it's free.

01:36:12.401 --> 01:36:15.561
- Are you crazy? - Don't
talk to me like that.

01:36:16.441 --> 01:36:17.521
Come on.

01:36:19.721 --> 01:36:21.361
Can I put on my jacket?

01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:22.641
Come on.

01:36:40.481 --> 01:36:42.321
I have something to show you.

01:36:43.801 --> 01:36:44.801
You're hurting me.

01:36:45.001 --> 01:36:49.361
You're hurting yourself. He's not
coming back, Cécile.

01:36:51.801 --> 01:36:53.121
Go away!

01:36:58.801 --> 01:36:59.841
What about him?

01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:00.721
Drop that.

01:37:00.961 --> 01:37:01.801
Why? You don't care.

01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:04.001
Shut up. Drop it!

01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:05.521
You can't...

01:37:06.081 --> 01:37:06.881
But...

01:37:07.081 --> 01:37:10.121
Who do you think you are? You
can't do that!

01:37:10.361 --> 01:37:11.481
But you can?

01:37:11.681 --> 01:37:14.521
You can take care of others,
but not of yourself.

01:37:15.241 --> 01:37:17.081
Go away.

01:37:17.721 --> 01:37:19.201
Go away.

01:37:26.001 --> 01:37:29.601
Don't you think it's time you bury
your father for good?

01:37:43.641 --> 01:37:44.801
Let's go.

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:48.481
Come on.

01:37:50.001 --> 01:37:50.921
We're not coming back.

01:38:04.881 --> 01:38:05.481
I love you.

01:39:04.001 --> 01:39:05.321
I love you.

01:39:09.521 --> 01:39:11.841
Even if it won't always be easy.
