13:45.326 --> 13:46.660
That's logical.

Happened to me once.

13:48.787 --> 13:49.913
What?

13:50.289 --> 13:51.915
Sandal tracks.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.001
Sandals? Ugh!

13:54.585 --> 13:55.836
You wear sandals.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.297
- Like, never!

You will never find
a more retched hive of scum and villainy,

14:28.869 --> 14:31.121
and the crab cakes aren't bad, either.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.082
Ugh! Gross!

14:33.165 --> 14:34.166
(LAUGHS)

14:34.249 --> 14:36.752
It makes perfect sense you'd come here.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.171
- Uh, I don't think so.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.485
Uh! Freak!

15:04.363 --> 15:06.698
Have you seen him here before?

15:07.449 --> 15:08.450
No.

You?

He's been here before?

19:25.374 --> 19:27.584
Yeah! It was a while ago.

19:27.668 --> 19:31.088

for a long journey, somewhere far.

I don't know.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.007
