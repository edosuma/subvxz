00:02.560 --> 00:05.160
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.160 --> 00:06.560
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.560 --> 00:10.600
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.680
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.680 --> 00:19.640
and I'm drenched 
 in some weird chemical.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.280
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.880
My best friend Ray 
 thinks it's cool.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.040
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.680
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.800
Not even my parents.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.000
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:54.000 --> 00:55.840
and turn me into some experiment.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.320
But you know something?

00:57.320 --> 01:00.600
I guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.800
[Mrs Mack] 
 George, let's go!

01:03.800 --> 01:05.760
We're already late.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.120
Whose wedding is this again?

01:10.120 --> 01:12.640
Maggie's, remember? 
 Your cousin.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.720
- But she got married last year. 
 - She did.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.440
Don't ask.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.560
Later. Whoa!

01:20.560 --> 01:23.720
- Where are you going? 
 - To play minigolf with Ray.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.920
- They're open late on Fridays. 
 - Nice try.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.120
But you're staying home with Annie.

01:29.120 --> 01:33.520
- We want you both safe at home. 
 - Just me and... Annie?

01:33.520 --> 01:35.280
Nobody likes that.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.400
[Mrs Mack] I... I know 
 it's cruel of us but you'll survive.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.680
- Why don't you ask Ray over? 
 - Ooh, Annie.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.160
I almost forgot. 
 You have a letter.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.520
[Mr Mack] 
 Okay, let's go.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.440
You two have fun.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.400
And Annie is in charge, remember.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.200
Bye.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.760
So what did we wind up getting her?

02:01.760 --> 02:04.360
[Alex] 
 Well... see ya.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.960
Uh! Not a chance. 
 Alex, you heard them.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.039
What am I supposed to do here?

02:10.039 --> 02:12.400
Have you considered homework?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.680
On Friday night? 
 I don't think so.

02:15.680 --> 02:20.320
Well, we could sit around here 
 and get to know each other better.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.960
You're making homework 
 sound pretty good.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.280
16 points.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:42.320 --> 02:43.360
What?

02:43.360 --> 02:47.960
First of all, stop floating letters 
 and secondly, "majorly" is not a word.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.280
Yes, it is. 
 I've heard you say it.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.800
That doesn't make it a word.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.960
Let's just forget the whole game. 
 You're just too smart for me.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.760
Whatever.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.520
Do you do that just to annoy me?

03:08.520 --> 03:10.480
Do, I do it because it's easy.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.720
What's that letter you got?

03:13.720 --> 03:18.440
I got accepted to 
 the Phillipsburg Science Academy.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.720
What's that?

03:19.720 --> 03:22.640
One of the top science schools 
 in the country.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.040
Their next term starts 
 in about a month

03:25.040 --> 03:28.520
but I don't think I'm ready 
 to just... go away.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.600
Away?

03:30.600 --> 03:33.240
- The school's away? 
 - Yup.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.960
There's an orientation 
 next weekend.

03:35.960 --> 03:41.000
Sounds great, but... 
 Mmm, I don't think so.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.360
Annie... go! 
 At leas to the orientation.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.440
I mean, think about it. 
 This could be the chance of a lifetime.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.680
For you.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.920
[whirring]

04:34.720 --> 04:36.840
Alex, what are you doing?

04:38.600 --> 04:41.480
We know you love 
 to use your powers

04:41.480 --> 04:43.480
but we'd rather 
 you saved them for fun.

04:43.480 --> 04:48.440
Now that you're our only child 
 your happiness is our first priority.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.720
Okay, but I better do my homework.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.040
Silly girl, your father did it for you.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.440
Great! 
 Can I go play minigolf with Ray?

04:56.440 --> 05:01.080
Invite Ray to play the new 
 minigolf course in the backyard!

05:01.080 --> 05:04.320
My own personal golf course?

05:04.320 --> 05:07.800
We used the money we saved 
 since your sister moved away.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.000
- What was her name again? 
 - It doesn't matter.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.720
What matters is 
 that there is nothing

05:13.720 --> 05:16.720
to distract us from 
 spoiling our only child.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.160
Mmm... 
 Mmm...

05:26.560 --> 05:28.800
I'll help you pack.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.080
Annie, you do realize it's okay 
 if you don't like this place.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.600
I know, I heard you 
 the first hundred times you told me.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.520
There's no reason why 
 you have to leave your family

05:46.520 --> 05:48.160
to get a good education.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.800
But if you really like this place 
 we're behind you 100%.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.960
Yeah, but it's probably some dull

05:53.960 --> 05:56.760
academically uninspired 
 boot camp, anyway.

05:56.760 --> 06:01.200
Yeah, it's very institutional. 
 I bet you everybody's really pale.

06:13.840 --> 06:18.440
Actually... this looks pretty cool.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.000
[sighing]

06:20.000 --> 06:25.880
[woman screaming, 
 gunfire, pig squealing]

06:25.880 --> 06:29.040
This might be the worst 
 movie I've ever seen.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.400
It's like they made it 
 stink on purpose.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.120
Let's find another.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.440
[horses stampeding, gunfire]

06:36.440 --> 06:38.080
This is the life.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.880
Annie's not here 
 to intrude on our fun.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.320
I really think you'd miss Annie 
 if she wasn't around.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.320
I've spent 13 years with her! 
 I think that's plenty.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.720
Once your parents start 
 focusing in on you alone

06:51.720 --> 06:53.760
they'll never get off your back.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.760
I can handle them.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.040
I just fixed that old loose screen

06:59.040 --> 07:01.520
and was about to 
 clean out the gutters

07:01.520 --> 07:04.600
when I realized 
 I was neglecting the two of you.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.720
How about you two 
 helping me out?

07:06.720 --> 07:12.600
Gee, Dad, I'd love to 
 but... we just ate.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.200
Oh, okay. 
 Just thought I'd ask.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.680
- See, I told you I could handle them. 
 - Ah, here's one.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.000
[man screaming, 
 chain saw buzzing]

07:25.000 --> 07:28.080
- Serial-killing grandma. 
 - Works for me.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.880
[chain saw buzzing]

07:53.360 --> 07:56.320
- Are you Anne Mack? 
 - Annie.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.480
- Who are you? 
 - I'm your student host, Bruce Lester.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.680
- Can I show you around? 
 - Uh-huh.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.120
- Hi. 
 - Bruce Lester, student host.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.920
Barbara Mack, mother.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.200
Well... ready?

08:17.520 --> 08:22.560
Student host... huh! 
 They sure don't miss a trick.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.800
Think we're getting older?

08:25.800 --> 08:29.640
That's the first time I ever 
 stopped watching TV on purpose.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.159
- Let's play hide-and-go-seek. 
 - Like when we were seven?

08:33.159 --> 08:37.039
You couldn't morph then. 
 It might be more interesting now.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.919
- Annie would hate it. 
 - Annie isn't here.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.440
Okay, turn around and count to ten.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.040
No going into pipes 
 or anything like that.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.240
It wouldn't be fair.

08:48.360 --> 08:53.360
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

08:53.760 --> 08:55.960
four, three...

08:56.600 --> 08:58.760
[Mr Mack] 
 Alex! Are you in there?

08:58.760 --> 09:02.000
- Where's Alex? 
 - She went to get something.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.640
I thought I'd surprise 
 Alex's mom and do the laundry.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.960
The laundry? 
 You can't do the laundry now.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.440
I certainly can.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.120
I'm in the middle of 
 my second load already.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.880
[birds chirping]

09:23.880 --> 09:27.600
I had no idea you were 
 teaching here, Professor Lake.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.800
I've read just about 
 everything you've written.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.120
Good! I have seven 
 unpublished works

09:33.120 --> 09:35.280
I'd be happy to burden you with.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.520
You have really been 
 an inspiration.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.360
My dear, the road to brilliance 
 is littered with the bodies

09:41.360 --> 09:43.720
of those I've inspired before you.

09:43.720 --> 09:48.560
What you have to do is use 
 my ideas as stepping stones

09:48.560 --> 09:50.920
to attain your own future glories.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.880
I've maintained a 4.0 
 average since preschool.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.600
But the idea of throwing myself 
 into some academic rat race

09:57.600 --> 10:01.240
- doesn't seem so great. 
 - Nonsense!

10:01.240 --> 10:05.320
Phillipsburg is an extremely 
 challenging and positive environment.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.440
You think I would waste 
 my time here otherwise?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.720
I am curious.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.920
Why would a former 
 nobel prize winner like you

10:13.920 --> 10:16.640
spend his time 
 in such a small school?

10:16.640 --> 10:19.720
Annie, size if not 
 an indication of greatness.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.840
Besides, in the last few years

10:21.840 --> 10:25.600
my work has been looked upon 
 by the scientific community

10:25.600 --> 10:28.320
an increasingly eccentric 
 and bizarre.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.600
I'm just hoping that 
 my theories will live on

10:31.600 --> 10:33.440
through the students here.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.000
Well, if I enrolled here

10:35.000 --> 10:38.240
is there any way 
 I could have you as a teacher?

10:38.240 --> 10:40.400
I think I'd have to insist upon it.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.800
Tell you what.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.440
I'll take care of this 
 for you, Mr. Mack.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.000
It's just a matter of 
 turning the dryer on.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.160
Oh, can't forget one of these.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.000
I hate static cling.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.320
- [switches on dryer] 
 - Let's go find Alex.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.240
Shouldn't I stay here 
 and watch the dryer?

11:08.240 --> 11:10.440
The dryer knows what it's doing.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.080
Come on!

11:22.280 --> 11:23.960
Alex!

11:23.960 --> 11:28.600
- Alex, are you all right? 
 - Um... I think so.

11:28.600 --> 11:32.480
Sorry about that. 
 Your dad was all over me.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.280
I almost got caught 
 in the lint trap.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.080
- Do you know what that's like? 
 - Uh...

11:39.080 --> 11:41.520
Not really.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.680
Help me, Ray.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.080
Sorry you can't stay for 
 the chess tournament, Annie.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.520
I'm a lousy player. 
 You'd lose respect for me.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.800
Somehow I don't think so.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.240
So, what are the chances 
 of getting you out here?

11:59.240 --> 12:01.600
Better than they were 
 when I got here.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.040
A lot of the students 
 know about you

12:04.040 --> 12:06.000
and really want you to enroll.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.920
None of them more than me.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.040
Now, I bet this school 
 pays you to be a salesman

12:11.040 --> 12:14.160
- for all the potential students. 
 - No way.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.800
- I pick my spots. 
 - Okay, let's move 'em on out.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.520
- Bye, Bruce. 
 - Bye, Ms. Mack.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.600
Bye, Annie.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.480
Bye. 
 Hope we see each other very soon.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.480
I do, too.

12:28.960 --> 12:29.680
What?!

12:39.000 --> 12:40.600
- Dad. 
 - Hey!

12:40.600 --> 12:42.880
- Alex. 
 - Sleeping?

12:42.880 --> 12:46.160
Uh... no, no, I was just, 
 uh, resting my eyes.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.240
Feel like going to the movies?

12:48.240 --> 12:52.520
Oh, I'd love to, Alex 
 but I'm waiting for Stan to call.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.840
- Why don't you go with Ray? 
 - He's playing basketball.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.480
Want to play scrabble?

12:57.480 --> 13:00.160
- Ah, can't, honey. 
 - [phone ringing]

13:00.160 --> 13:02.240
There's Stan now.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.120
[zapping]

13:05.400 --> 13:07.600
Alex? Alex.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.520
Are you okay?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.360
Yeah, I just got a little dizzy.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.880
It's probably nothing.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.360
Maybe I should take you 
 to the doctor.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.560
The doctor? I don't want 
 to go to the doctor.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.360
It's just Dr. Whiteside.

13:23.360 --> 13:27.560
He'll give you a through exam 
 and figure out what's going on.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.520
I'll call him right now.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.480
- Nice school, huh? 
 - Nice? Are you kidding?

13:35.480 --> 13:39.640
- It was amazing. 
 - Mind if I'm honest with you?

13:39.640 --> 13:41.240
That depends.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.120
I don't think 
 you should go away to school.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.880
Not yet.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.960
Then why did you take me here?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.680
I wanted you 
 to make your own decision.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.440
Yeah, I can see that.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.520
Annie, you have 
 your whole life to be away.

13:56.520 --> 14:00.800
You should enjoy your home and 
 your family while you have them.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.080
It's only for a few 
 more years, anyway.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.320
I think you should think about Alex.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.600
Oh, way to convince me 
 to stay home.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.600
She needs you, Annie.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.280
She's going through that 
 awkward stage right now.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.640
I think you're the only one 
 that understands her.

14:16.640 --> 14:21.560
- But if you really want to go away... 
 - Yeah, then you're behind me 100%.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.640
I want to go to Phillipsburg, Mom.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.360
I thought so.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.280
[Mrs Mack] Doesn't the house look 
 great after you've been away?

14:51.280 --> 14:53.320
It looks like it always does, Mom.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.240
[Alex] 
 Annie! You're back!

15:01.280 --> 15:03.960
Perceptive, aren't we?

15:03.960 --> 15:06.480
I'm really glad to see you.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.280
Really? 
 You must be sick.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.600
She is. 
 I'm taking her to the doctor.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.920
- The doctor?! 
 - The doctor?

15:12.920 --> 15:16.960
- I'm sure she doesn't need one. 
 - How would you know?

15:16.960 --> 15:21.200
I told him about that kid in your 
 class who had the same thing I do--

15:21.200 --> 15:23.040
The dizziness thing.

15:23.040 --> 15:27.800
You're right. He had that. 
 It turned out to be nothing.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.160
But you don't even 
 know her symptoms.

15:30.160 --> 15:34.280
Before you take her to the doctor 
 let me give that guy a call.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.400
His dad's a doctor.

15:36.400 --> 15:41.160
And it's the quickest way to get 
 Alex the care that she needs.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.200
She fell, and I grabbed her. 
 I kept her from...

15:51.000 --> 15:53.240
You got stuck in the dryer?

15:54.480 --> 15:57.440
I don't even want 
 to know the details.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.720
I feel really fuzzy.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.920
What do you think it is?

16:02.920 --> 16:06.520
You're probably dehydrated 
 from just all the hot air.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.000
Thanks for saving me down there.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.520
Back in the saddle, 
 and I haven't even unpacked yet.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.720
What's this?

16:15.720 --> 16:19.160
- The institution? 
 - My new home.

16:19.160 --> 16:23.440
Finally, independence. 
 For both of us.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.920
- You're going? 
 - Yup. All of this will be yours.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.040
- You still fuzzy? 
 - No. No.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.320
Couldn't be better.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.880
- So you're really going? 
 - Is that a problem?

16:38.880 --> 16:41.440
No, of course not.

16:43.040 --> 16:46.960
Annie, I'm just surprised 
 you want to be another genius

16:46.960 --> 16:48.840
in a big sea full of geniuses.

16:48.840 --> 16:52.360
But we totally support 
 any decision you made.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.680
Good, because I'm not changing it.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.400
[Mr Mack panting]

16:56.400 --> 17:01.640
- Is that everything? 
 - Yeah, let me help you pack the car.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.880
- So, this is it. 
 - Yeah.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.960
Finally.

17:11.880 --> 17:15.440
Well, um... so long.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.480
[zapping]

17:28.840 --> 17:32.240
Can't you at least wait 
 until I'm out of the driveway

17:32.240 --> 17:34.600
before you start getting 
 reckless again?

17:34.600 --> 17:38.880
- But I didn't mean to. 
 - I got to go.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.680
[Alex] 
 Wait. Annie.

17:41.680 --> 17:45.320
- I just wanted to tell you that... 
 - [zapping]

17:45.320 --> 17:47.200
Um...

17:47.200 --> 17:50.480
Alex? Alex, stop it!

17:50.480 --> 17:54.160
I can't. I...

17:57.680 --> 18:01.640
Girls, we should be leaving 
 in about ten minutes.

18:01.640 --> 18:06.280
- Where are you going? 
 - Alex and I have to talk.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.480
- [zapping] 
 - [Alex] There goes my big toe.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.480
Alex...

18:15.760 --> 18:19.360
Did Dad use one of these 
 when he threw you in the dryer?

18:19.360 --> 18:22.320
- Those perfumey things? 
 - I think so.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.880
Do you realize the main ingredient 
 in these is hydrophilic polymer?

18:26.880 --> 18:29.080
No, Annie, 
 I did not realize that.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.440
It reacted with 
 your internal GC-161

18:31.440 --> 18:34.520
which naturally causes 
 your morphing frenzy.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.640
Does that mean you can fix it?

18:36.640 --> 18:40.000
I already have enough 
 trouble fitting in at school.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.640
Give me a minute to find a formula.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.680
[churning]

18:50.840 --> 18:52.600
What's in that?

18:52.600 --> 18:56.600
Ask yourself if you really want 
 to know the answer to that.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.160
Annie, what are you 
 girls doing in here?

18:59.160 --> 19:01.920
- Saying good-bye. 
 - Can you give us a minute?

19:01.920 --> 19:04.520
Sure. Of course.

19:06.280 --> 19:10.760
Sorry there's 
 no little paper unbrellas.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.760
Drink.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.680
That's it. I knew it.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.440
- Got to go. 
 - Wait a minute.

19:30.440 --> 19:34.080
- How can you leave? 
 - What do you mean?

19:34.080 --> 19:38.200
You think some school will give you 
 a better science project than me?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.760
No, but I've got to get on 
 with my life.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.760
- Not yet. 
 - You only want me to watch over you.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.150
No.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.040
I'll miss you.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.400
- I'll miss my sister. 
 - I'll miss you, too, Alex.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.520
But you're going to be okay.

19:56.520 --> 20:00.600
I know I'd manage if I had to 
 but I want you to stay because...

20:00.600 --> 20:03.320
we're starting to make 
 a pretty good team.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.440
With me doing all the work.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.640
Oh, admit it, Annie, 
 we have fun.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.960
I may now be 
 the most fun you've had

20:09.960 --> 20:13.160
in your whole brainy life.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.600
Come on, don't go. 
 Not yet.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.480
Wait a few years and then 
 join the circus, or something.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.080
The circus?

20:21.080 --> 20:24.000
You're the one that 
 should join the circus.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.960
Totally freak show.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.120
Okay.

20:33.120 --> 20:37.240
A few more years... 
 and then I'm gone.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.720
Annie.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.360
Really? Finally?

20:53.360 --> 20:54.840
Yeah, to unpack.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.600
Unpack? Are you kidding?

20:57.600 --> 21:01.760
She just couldn't bear 
 the thought of leaving me.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.200
No, really, 
 why aren't you going?

21:04.200 --> 21:06.520
I just realized that 
 I'd feel better

21:06.520 --> 21:10.400
if I stayed and impressed 
 everybody with my 4.0 average.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.720
It's the "big fish, small pond" thing.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.080
I can tell superiority 
 is really important to me.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.000
Well, I don't buy any of it

21:18.000 --> 21:21.280
but I'll take your decision 
 and run with it.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.760
- [both laughing] 
 - Whoa, um...

21:23.760 --> 21:27.040
Dad should be just about 
 finished packing the car.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.240
Who wants to tell him?

21:30.720 --> 21:33.600
- Come on, Mom. 
 - Oh, you cowards.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.960
Come on, 
 you know you want to.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.680
You said your sister 
 was completely average.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.200
She is.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.240
She's the best frisbee 
 player I've ever seen.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.600
- Alex. 
 - [panting]

22:01.320 --> 22:02.880
What's the matter?

22:02.880 --> 22:05.040
Nothing, 
 she's just showing off.

22:05.040 --> 22:08.800
If I could play like that, 
 I think I'd show off, too.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.040
So, you never really told me.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.000
What kept you from coming 
 to Phillipsburg?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.880
I guess I just wasn't ready.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.680
I still have a lot of things 
 to finish here.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.080
You could have brought 
 any on going projects with you.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.840
There is one big project

22:25.840 --> 22:29.400
that I wouldn't have 
 been able to bring.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.440
But, look, I got a stay

22:31.440 --> 22:34.720
and I got you to come here 
 to visit me.

22:37.640 --> 22:41.080
Your sister must be 
 really jealous of you.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.680
I mean, you're pretty 
 you're brilliant.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.600
Alex has her own talents, 
 trust me.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.640
Do you feel like... 
 taking a walk?

22:51.640 --> 22:53.880
Sure.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.920
So your sister finally met a guy.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.840
Yup, another super-brain 
 who's no fun.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.280
They're perfect for each other.
