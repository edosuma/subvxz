Previously on Mech-X4...

00:06.291 --> 00:09.458
This guy built a robot
specifically for a technopath.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.458
-Why?
-To protect Bay City.

00:11.542 --> 00:13.667
(Man) You cannot imagine
the horrors coming your way.

00:13.750 --> 00:16.583
Monsters as big
as a robot, if not bigger.

00:16.667 --> 00:19.709
-(screaming)
-You fascinate me!

00:19.792 --> 00:22.291
I just want to know
more about you.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.875
You have to keep your identity a secret.
If they know you're in there,

00:24.959 --> 00:27.875
these people will strike directly at you
and everyone you know.

00:27.959 --> 00:30.125
I can destroy Mech-X4

00:30.208 --> 00:32.875
and tear that robot apart!

00:32.959 --> 00:36.500
Oh!
So, so gross!

00:36.583 --> 00:38.166
Ow.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.125
(grunting)

00:45.208 --> 00:46.542
(Mark) Come on, Ryan.
Keep your hands up.

00:46.625 --> 00:48.208
-You're getting killed here.
-I'm trying!

00:48.291 --> 00:50.458
Keep moving. Come on!

00:50.542 --> 00:51.917
Where are your hands?
Cover it.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.250
-Up!
-It's over.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.083
-Say your prayers.
-(grunts)

00:59.417 --> 01:01.458
Boom!

01:01.542 --> 01:04.083
Hey, can you make my robot
do a victory dance?

01:04.166 --> 01:06.959
You know,
something like this?

01:07.041 --> 01:10.083
Do you know
what a sore winner is?

01:10.166 --> 01:12.291
Yeah.
It means I'm a winner.

01:12.375 --> 01:15.166
Hoo!

01:15.250 --> 01:18.542
You know, you could have won
if you'd tried a rope-a-dope.

01:18.625 --> 01:20.667
Okay, you put yourself
out there,

01:20.750 --> 01:22.583
make me think
you're defenseless,

01:22.667 --> 01:25.458
draw me in and boom!
Drop a hammer on me.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.458
Dude, you were exercising
my power.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.041
I gotta train you how to fight.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.959
You're the one throwing the punches
out there.

01:34.083 --> 01:38.000
Uh, Harris, I really think
you forgot something.

01:44.125 --> 01:45.834
Oh.

01:45.917 --> 01:47.375
I walked here from home.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.792
That would explain the pointing...

01:49.875 --> 01:52.667
and this cutie's digits!

01:52.750 --> 01:54.583
"Bethany"!

01:54.667 --> 01:56.166
Nice.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.750
What's up
with the strappy socks?

01:58.834 --> 02:00.834
They're called sock garters.

02:00.917 --> 02:03.166
(demonic echoing) They're the footwear
of gentlemen, nimwit.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.667
What did you just call me,
freshman?

02:05.750 --> 02:07.208
(grunting)

02:07.291 --> 02:09.208
That's my arm!

02:09.291 --> 02:12.083
What the heck!
Stop!

02:12.166 --> 02:14.417
-(demonic grunting)
-Mark!

02:14.500 --> 02:15.750
(grunts)

02:18.208 --> 02:20.542
-Ah!
-Harris! Hey!

02:23.792 --> 02:25.083
Please...

02:25.166 --> 02:28.083
(demonic echoing)
help me.

02:29.542 --> 02:32.166
(theme music playing)

02:51.208 --> 02:53.041
(seagulls squawking)

02:53.125 --> 02:55.917
(machine scanning)

02:57.625 --> 02:59.291
Hey, how you feeling?

02:59.375 --> 03:01.000
A little bit better.

03:01.083 --> 03:04.166
So can you tell me exactly
what happened...

03:04.250 --> 03:06.750
-(crashing)
-(Spyder screaming)

03:06.834 --> 03:08.542
What was that?

03:11.125 --> 03:14.959
What? Your text said
"get here ASAP," which I did,

03:15.041 --> 03:18.250
after I looked up "ASAP."

03:18.333 --> 03:19.583
Come on.

03:21.750 --> 03:25.291
This better not be
the microthruster I just fixed.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.458
I was testing it.
And guess what?

03:27.542 --> 03:29.333
It thrusted!

03:29.417 --> 03:31.667
And now it's busted.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.458
Um, hey, congrats!

03:33.542 --> 03:35.583
So you guys thought twice
about bringing me on the team,

03:35.667 --> 03:37.166
but you chose this trainwreck
right away.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.083
-I am standing right here.
-Yeah, don't remind us.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.875
I can fix it, okay?

03:42.959 --> 03:45.291
Just like I fixed
my broken leg. Didn't I?

03:45.375 --> 03:47.500
-You remember that?
-I remember you

03:47.583 --> 03:49.500
trying to fix your leg
in shop class and you fainted

03:49.583 --> 03:51.083
and you had to be rushed
to the hospital.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.458
Yeah, your surgery
was crowd-funded.

03:53.542 --> 03:56.166
I still have the T-shirt.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.250
-(grunting)
-You okay?

03:58.333 --> 03:59.917
No.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.583
I accidentally ate some of that stuff
the monster was made of.

04:02.667 --> 04:05.250
Did it taste disgusting
like cat food

04:05.333 --> 04:07.834
or awesome like dog food?

04:07.917 --> 04:12.417
But the monster ooze... it's turning me
into something not human.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.875
It does look like if I had a sample
of that substance,

04:14.959 --> 04:16.583
I could reverse engineer
an antidote.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.041
(Mark)
Great! So we can cure you.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.250
We can get you some more ooze.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.500
-We just...
-(gurgling)

04:21.583 --> 04:24.458
Um, we'll draw a new monster out
by using Mech-X4 as bait.

04:24.542 --> 04:26.583
You know, or we could just
find that glowy orby thing

04:26.667 --> 04:29.125
-from the first fight.
-Yeah, we can... Wait, what?

04:31.291 --> 04:33.583
And then at the end,
the robot just liquefied that thing.

04:33.667 --> 04:37.667
And I saw it first. If you share this,
you must credit Cassie Park.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.959
Okay, so the whole monster
turned to ooze,

04:41.041 --> 04:44.250
except for that object?

04:44.333 --> 04:46.542
It kind of looks like
the monster's heart.

04:46.625 --> 04:50.333
I watched this video
and didn't notice that orb.

04:50.417 --> 04:51.709
How did you?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.875
Well, I mean,
after the hundredth viewing,

04:53.959 --> 04:55.375
you start to spot stuff.

04:55.458 --> 04:58.542
Like she has 18 tiny wrinkles
when she smiles.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.375
-What?
-One for every month of the year.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.333
So you saw this weird thing
and you didn't think to mention it?

05:04.417 --> 05:06.291
Well, no, I did mention it...

05:06.375 --> 05:07.500
just now.
That counts, right?

05:07.583 --> 05:10.166
(All) No! Not at all.
Why would it?

05:10.250 --> 05:11.959
Hold on, guys.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.834
So from the direction
and apparent speed,

05:13.917 --> 05:17.750
I'd say it landed somewhere
in the woods near Colton Ridge.

05:17.834 --> 05:21.041
(Ryan) There still might be some ooze
on it we can use to cure Harris.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.959
(hawk squawking)

05:39.041 --> 05:42.041
(monitor beeping quickly)

05:43.917 --> 05:47.709
(beeping speed increases)

05:47.792 --> 05:49.208
(beeping stops)

05:50.583 --> 05:52.750
Mud, dirt, twigs.

05:52.834 --> 05:55.542
But the residual goop
is all dried out.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.417
Useless!

05:57.500 --> 05:59.208
Hey, don't worry about it.
We'll find more.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.792
We wouldn't have to

06:01.875 --> 06:04.458
if we had gotten to it
when you saw it.

06:04.542 --> 06:07.000
(demonic echoing)
You know, could you not be you

06:07.083 --> 06:10.417
and try helping just once?

06:11.959 --> 06:13.333
I can help.

06:13.417 --> 06:16.583
I am gonna go
fix this rocket.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.083
And if you need me, I'll...

06:18.166 --> 06:20.625
(demonic echoing)
We won't! Go!

06:27.041 --> 06:29.083
What did I just say?

06:29.166 --> 06:30.875
Exactly what
we were all thinking.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.500
Hey.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.750
I didn't mean that.
That wasn't me talking.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.792
The ooze is causing
all these outbursts.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.208
I can't control them.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.834
Which is why
we need to cure you.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.333
This thing can't help us
at all?

06:44.959 --> 06:47.375
It looks like
there's black dust here.

06:55.083 --> 06:58.083
-(beeping)
-Volcanic rock?

06:58.166 --> 07:00.917
But the only volcano
around here is Mount Hartley.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.041
Let's go check it out.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.792
But Spyder...

07:05.875 --> 07:07.000
Let's get you better.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.000
Seriously, he probably
already forgot about it.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.291
(Spyder) Stupid friends
don't think I can help.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.041
I fixed this thing
with duct tape,

07:13.125 --> 07:14.417
just like I fixed my leg.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.166
Hey, kid, what are you
doing here so late?

07:16.250 --> 07:18.000
And what's in the cart?

07:18.083 --> 07:21.417
Oh! Cassie, what up, girl?
How you livin'?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.125
I'm living way out of your league.

07:23.208 --> 07:26.083
That looks like
it fell off Mech-X4.

07:26.166 --> 07:29.917
Wait! No!
It is a rocket. I built it

07:30.000 --> 07:34.917
to, uh, rocket this shopping cart
across the lake

07:35.000 --> 07:36.750
and break Danny Rotzoll's cart record.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.000
Never heard of him.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.625
Of course not.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.166
I mean, the man doesn't even
want you to know who he is.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.959
He tried to get across the lake,

07:45.041 --> 07:47.125
but he didn't make it.
But I will!

07:47.208 --> 07:49.208
Does anyone else
know you're doing this?

07:49.291 --> 07:50.709
Just you.

07:50.792 --> 07:53.458
An exclusive.

07:53.542 --> 07:57.000
Haven't had one of those
since the first Mech-X4 fight.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.583
Great.
I'll stream your stunt.

07:59.667 --> 08:00.959
Let's go.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.166
-Oh. Oh, like right now?
-Mm-hmm.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.625
No, I gotta get back to my friends.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.458
Gotta hang out, guys' night...

08:07.542 --> 08:11.041
Or you could do that stupid and dangerous
thing you were planning on

08:11.125 --> 08:12.625
and hang out with me.

08:12.709 --> 08:15.041
(echoing) Hang out with me,
hang out with me,

08:15.125 --> 08:16.834
hang out with me.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.000
Yeah. Yeah, that second one.

08:26.208 --> 08:29.083
(robotic whirring)

08:35.709 --> 08:37.709
Is that the stuff that we can make
an antidote with?

08:37.792 --> 08:39.041
Yeah.

08:52.333 --> 08:56.083
(alert beeping on phone)

08:56.166 --> 08:59.125
It's Davage at site alpha.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.709
We've been compromised.

09:00.792 --> 09:02.250
Check your feed, boss.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.041
The volcano?
That robot again!

09:05.125 --> 09:06.959
They found
the Primorphorous gel.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.333
Do we have a monster ready?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.000
We do not!

09:10.083 --> 09:12.291
(Ryan)
All right, then how do I get it out?

09:12.375 --> 09:13.834
Do I just... do I scoop it out?

09:13.917 --> 09:16.166
-(sighs)
-Wait, Mark, get a shovel.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.500
Why do I
have to get the shovel?

09:17.583 --> 09:18.959
How we gonna get it out?

09:19.041 --> 09:21.208
(demonic echoing)
This is taking too long!

09:22.709 --> 09:27.041
-(grunting)
-Whoa! Hey!

09:29.875 --> 09:31.959
Ah!

09:33.458 --> 09:34.875
Stay down, Dingus!

09:34.959 --> 09:37.375
Hey, hey, Harris,
calm down!

09:37.458 --> 09:39.625
(scanning)

09:39.709 --> 09:42.417
-Initiate the fail-safe.
-You're destroying the site?

09:42.500 --> 09:45.208
And burying that robot
in the volcano.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.458
But we need that gel
to build more monsters.

09:47.542 --> 09:51.667
Well, I need that robot
gone more. Now do it!

09:51.750 --> 09:55.291
Unless you want scars
on the other eye.

09:58.041 --> 10:01.291
(explosions detonating)

10:03.083 --> 10:05.041
-Earthquake?
-No, no, no, no, no!

10:05.125 --> 10:06.750
That's an explosion!

10:06.834 --> 10:08.208
Get us out of here!

10:21.750 --> 10:26.125
(grunting)

10:33.500 --> 10:37.208
(Mark) (echoing)
Ry?

10:37.291 --> 10:40.750
Ry? You okay?
Talk to me.

10:40.834 --> 10:43.583
(Ryan grunting)

10:46.250 --> 10:48.792
Why do you have that
"I just went on a date with two girls

10:48.875 --> 10:51.041
and both of them found out" look?

10:51.125 --> 10:53.291
(Mark) We're stuck inside
a huge pit of ooze.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.166
It's clogging all our vents.
We're running out of air.

10:56.250 --> 11:00.333
We have about
17 minutes of oxygen left.

11:00.417 --> 11:02.709
We gotta get out
of this ooze.

11:04.583 --> 11:08.792
Ooze? Harris,
we can cure you with...

11:08.875 --> 11:10.250
Wait, where's Harris?

11:13.083 --> 11:15.083
(demonic growling)

11:15.166 --> 11:17.208
He did that?

11:17.291 --> 11:19.792
He's getting worse?
We have to find him.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.667
After we free ourselves.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.083
Can you rocket-boost us
out of here?

11:24.166 --> 11:26.083
(beeping)

11:26.166 --> 11:28.166
All right,
the thrusters are working,

11:28.250 --> 11:29.959
but we just can't smash
through the rubble.

11:30.041 --> 11:32.875
So we blast it
with the arm cannon.

11:32.959 --> 11:36.417
(Ryan)
Oh no, the arm cannon is busted.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.959
Power cable snapped.

11:38.041 --> 11:41.875
(Mark) The only way to reattach it
is from the outside.

11:41.959 --> 11:44.333
So we're trapped in here
with 17 minutes...

11:44.417 --> 11:47.291
16 minutes to figure out
how to get back online.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.709
And find Harris.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.417
Ryan, he's not the priority.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.667
If we run out of air,
we all die, even Harris.

11:53.750 --> 11:57.375
-We have to get out of here first.
-No, we can do both!

11:57.458 --> 11:59.000
You know what?
I'm gonna find a signal

11:59.083 --> 12:02.000
and I'm gonna text Spyder. He can fix
the arm cannon from the outside.

12:02.083 --> 12:04.125
That guy to the rescue?

12:04.208 --> 12:08.458
My thought is stop signs
are merely suggestions.

12:08.542 --> 12:13.709
And maybe your gums were
meant to bleed when you sneeze.

12:13.792 --> 12:17.500
The question was how old are you?

12:17.583 --> 12:20.959
-We're doomed.
-No, he'll come through for us...

12:21.041 --> 12:23.583
I hope.
Can you just find Harris?

12:25.917 --> 12:29.917
What? What is it?
Is it... is it...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.041
is it Mark Walker?
Is he scared?

12:32.125 --> 12:34.417
-Of Harris?
-Pfft! What?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
Me? No way. No chance.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.792
(deep growling)

12:38.875 --> 12:41.291
But I'm rigging
some sort of protection,

12:41.375 --> 12:43.792
-just in case.
-Yeah.

12:43.875 --> 12:45.792
Come on, Spyder.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.875
(grunting)

12:48.959 --> 12:52.250
-(beeping)
-Come on, Spyder.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.917
(deep growling)

12:56.000 --> 12:58.083
Are you going to talk
about your stunt, or...

12:58.166 --> 13:01.250
Enough small talk. Here,
come sit down with me right here.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.458
Come on.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.041
Do you think
this is a date?

13:05.125 --> 13:07.625
No! No, no, no.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.041
Now it is.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.125
No, it is not!

13:11.208 --> 13:12.709
The lake! Now!

13:18.959 --> 13:21.709
(pinging)

13:21.792 --> 13:24.208
I just did a thermographic scan.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.333
I'm uploading it to your feed.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.542
You'll want to see this.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.792
There are people in it?

13:31.875 --> 13:34.792
It's not automated?
It has pilots?

13:34.875 --> 13:36.667
Who are you?

13:45.667 --> 13:47.166
Ah!

13:47.250 --> 13:49.959
Here, mathlete, mathlete.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.000
(watch whirs)

13:52.083 --> 13:54.000
Only eight minutes of air left.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.125
(deep growling)

13:59.917 --> 14:01.750
(rattling)

14:13.417 --> 14:15.917
(deep rumbling)

14:16.000 --> 14:17.792
(growling)

14:24.000 --> 14:25.083
Ooh!

14:37.041 --> 14:38.834
(coughs)

14:41.000 --> 14:43.333
No signal.
Come on!

14:43.417 --> 14:45.166
(growling)

14:53.667 --> 14:55.625
-(pinging)
-Yes, finally!

14:55.709 --> 14:57.125
Okay, come on, Spyder.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.750
-(growling)
-Harris!

15:11.208 --> 15:13.959
Harris, we can cure you!
We have the ooze. Let me up.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.625
-(gun charging up)
-Ahh!

15:16.709 --> 15:19.709
Found him!
Now run!

15:22.792 --> 15:25.542
(growling)

15:31.583 --> 15:34.125
(Mark) You know, you could
have won if you'd tried a rope-a-dope.

15:34.208 --> 15:36.625
- (echoing) Rope-a-dope, rope-a-dope...
-Rope-a-dope.

15:36.709 --> 15:39.875
Hey! Hey, over here.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.542
-Okay, um...
-(growling)

15:42.625 --> 15:45.709
Draw him in, make him think
you're defenseless...

15:51.208 --> 15:53.041
drop a hammer on him.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.959
Sorry, dude,
but it was for your own good.

16:08.041 --> 16:11.834
-Good move.
-Good advice!

16:14.291 --> 16:16.792
Man, I really hope
my text got through.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.959
All right,
the light is perfect.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.917
The wind is perfect.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.250
-Let's do this.
-(phone beeping)

16:25.250 --> 16:28.375
(sighs)
Flag on the play. I gotta go!

16:28.458 --> 16:30.458
What?

16:30.542 --> 16:32.875
Oh, no,
you're not going anywhere.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.417
I've been listening to you
ramble for hours.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.000
It's been, like, 15 minutes.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.667
Well, it's felt
like hours.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.041
Now are you going
to jump the lake or not?

16:43.542 --> 16:45.500
He's so heavy!

16:47.583 --> 16:50.959
How could someone this small
be that heavy?

16:51.041 --> 16:54.500
He's like a calzone
full of bricks.

16:57.709 --> 17:00.041
All right, it's time for you
to get us out of here.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.125
Come on.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.458
And in case
this doesn't work,

17:12.542 --> 17:14.166
I just want you
to know that...

17:14.250 --> 17:17.750
-I know, I know.
-I'm too popular to die.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.000
Don't mess this up

17:20.083 --> 17:22.542
because people
will miss me.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.709
-Okay.
-More than they would you.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.834
Really? You're using up oxygen
for this?

17:30.792 --> 17:33.291
Friends come first.
So hasta la later!

17:33.375 --> 17:36.792
-(grunting)
-Ahh!

17:36.875 --> 17:40.792
Eh, Spyder! Spyder!

17:40.875 --> 17:43.542
I do not get ditched
by freshmen!

17:43.625 --> 17:48.166
She knows my name!

17:54.625 --> 17:56.709
One minute, buddy.
Get us out of here.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.750
Wait. Wait, I can feel
the cannon arm.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.083
It's coming back online.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.875
(motor sputtering)

18:08.959 --> 18:10.792
Broke my dream girl's heart
for this.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.792
You better appreciate it!

18:13.875 --> 18:16.834
Okay, Spyder's clear.
Mark, are you ready?

18:16.917 --> 18:18.792
Mark?

18:18.875 --> 18:20.792
Hey, Mark?

18:20.875 --> 18:22.250
I'm so tired.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.375
No, no, no!
Mark Walker doesn't get tired.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.583
We need a comeback victory!

18:26.667 --> 18:28.792
Come on!
This is where you live!

18:28.875 --> 18:31.875
I'm on it, Mom!

18:31.959 --> 18:33.959
Close enough.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.750
Now!

18:46.583 --> 18:49.000
(panting)

18:51.458 --> 18:54.166
I'm gonna get everybody
out of here.

19:16.875 --> 19:20.083
(air hissing)

19:20.166 --> 19:23.333
I did it!
I'm gonna live!

19:26.917 --> 19:28.750
Hey.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.709
(muttering)
Not the time. Not the time.

19:35.792 --> 19:36.875
(laughs)

19:36.959 --> 19:38.917
(Mark)
Uh, antidote? Now?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.875
Antidote now.

19:43.417 --> 19:45.375
That is the weirdest
antidote ever.

19:45.458 --> 19:48.083
There's turkey grease,
broccoli and monster ooze.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.291
Oh, gross, man... broccoli.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.083
Listen, Spyder,
what I said back there...

19:54.166 --> 19:55.625
Man, it's already forgotten.

19:55.709 --> 19:57.333
Thanks, dude.
That's really cool of you.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.375
We shouldn't have come down on you
as hard as we did.

19:59.458 --> 20:01.542
Yeah, me too.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.375
You deserve
to be on the team.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.709
You really came through
for us, Spicer... uh, Spyner...

20:06.792 --> 20:08.500
something with an S?

20:08.583 --> 20:13.000
-I'll take it.
-Help me.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.083
What the... No.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.500
Do you really
not know his name?

20:19.208 --> 20:20.792
-That's gross.
-Ugh!

20:20.875 --> 20:23.667
-Tastes good, though.
-(all gagging)

20:25.709 --> 20:28.583
(Mastermind) You lost a huge amount
of my Primorphorous gel

20:28.667 --> 20:30.583
and the robot survived.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.583
Give me a reason why I shouldn't
just have you eliminated.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.917
Because I learned
something valuable.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.709
The robot has pilots... human pilots.

20:42.417 --> 20:46.917
And humans will be
a lot easier to destroy.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.625
You're human.

20:49.709 --> 20:52.125
Keep that in mind
before you fail me again.

20:52.208 --> 20:55.166
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.625
So your little robot
has people inside it.

21:12.709 --> 21:15.125
Who are they?

21:15.208 --> 21:17.208
No clue.

21:17.291 --> 21:20.458
All I know is they're crushing
your monsters.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.000
Aren't they?

21:22.083 --> 21:23.166
Tell me!

21:26.583 --> 21:29.542
(growling)

21:33.250 --> 21:37.250
(theme music playing)
