00:01.702 --> 00:03.073
Previously on "body of proof"...

00:03.074 --> 00:04.035
(Filtered voice)
Couple of air locks...

00:04.036 --> 00:05.335
One here, one here.

00:05.336 --> 00:06.606
Dr. Charlie Stafford,
centers for disease control.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.278
It's said that I don't
play well with others.

00:08.279 --> 00:09.609
Have you met Megan hunt?

00:09.610 --> 00:12.342
You're making a big
mistake. You need our help.

00:12.343 --> 00:14.044
I put my life on the
line to save people.

00:14.045 --> 00:15.385
Then you should take advantage

00:15.386 --> 00:17.117
of what's standing
right in front of you.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.049
(Blows air)

00:19.050 --> 00:20.720
Is that grandpa?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.021
You should have this.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.154
What is this, a suicide note?

00:24.155 --> 00:25.526
You hid this all these years?

00:26.757 --> 00:28.128
What's this?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.629
It's my father's suicide note.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.760
I need you to run
it through the lab.

00:30.761 --> 00:32.202
Why?

00:32.203 --> 00:34.134
Because I don't believe
a word in that note.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.168
My father did not kill himself.

00:38.509 --> 00:39.669
(Elevator bell dings)

00:39.670 --> 00:43.744
(Lightbulb buzzing)

00:50.181 --> 00:51.382
(Sighs)

00:53.454 --> 00:55.655
(Door creaks open)

00:55.656 --> 00:57.788
(Thunks)

01:00.391 --> 01:02.192
Hello.

01:02.193 --> 01:04.063
(Buzzing continues)

01:04.064 --> 01:07.066
Who's there?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.568
(Door creaks)

01:08.569 --> 01:11.102
This isn't funny.

01:13.404 --> 01:15.575
I'm calling the police.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.348
(Moans)

01:19.380 --> 01:21.080
(Panting)

01:21.081 --> 01:22.412
(Growling)

01:22.413 --> 01:24.254
(Whimpers and pants)

01:24.255 --> 01:25.855
(Keys jangling)

01:25.856 --> 01:29.589
(Continues panting)

01:29.590 --> 01:32.192
(Man shouts indistinctly)

01:32.193 --> 01:34.194
(Grunts)

01:34.195 --> 01:35.425
(Groans)

01:35.426 --> 01:36.726
No!

01:36.727 --> 01:38.128
(Growling)

01:38.129 --> 01:39.599
(Shouts indistinctly)

01:39.600 --> 01:40.801
(Growling continues)

01:42.233 --> 01:43.403
(Growling continues)

01:43.404 --> 01:44.574
Aah! (Cries)

01:44.575 --> 01:45.675
(Man shrieks)

01:45.676 --> 01:48.209
No! Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:53.844 --> 01:57.788
(Parts clicking)

02:00.551 --> 02:02.322
That's very impressive.

02:02.323 --> 02:05.325
Hey. I was just gonna call you.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.598
But you decided to service
your weapon instead?

02:08.599 --> 02:12.332
Yeah, sometimes
it's all a guy's got.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.534
(Chuckles) But
something tells me

02:14.535 --> 02:17.867
you came here to talk about
something besides my gun.

02:17.868 --> 02:20.270
(Exhales) I, um...

02:20.271 --> 02:23.213
Was just wondering if you...

02:23.214 --> 02:26.816
Got the handwriting analysis
back on my father's note.

02:26.817 --> 02:28.848
Yep. It came back
this afternoon.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.420
I wanted to follow
up with the guy

02:30.421 --> 02:31.781
before I got with you on it.

02:31.782 --> 02:34.153
Why? What did it say?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.325
(Drops object on paper)

02:35.326 --> 02:36.486
Handwriting was a match.

02:36.487 --> 02:38.758
Your father definitely
wrote the note.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.291
But?

02:41.292 --> 02:43.533
Well, the analyst said
that there were indications

02:43.534 --> 02:45.835
that the note was written...

02:45.836 --> 02:47.637
Under duress.

02:47.638 --> 02:48.798
(Exhales) Now look, Megan...

02:48.799 --> 02:49.899
(Blows air) Okay.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.241
The definition of
someone who's suicidal

02:51.242 --> 02:52.502
means they're under duress.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.304
What about the... the forensics?

02:54.305 --> 02:55.675
I'm gonna push
them as fast as I can.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.207
Tommy, I need to know this. I...

02:57.208 --> 02:58.508
I know. You can count on me.

02:58.509 --> 03:01.781
Okay.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.713
Thanks.

03:03.714 --> 03:06.256
Megan, uh...

03:06.257 --> 03:07.787
The reason I was
gonna call you was,

03:07.788 --> 03:10.790
I scored a couple of tickets
to the flyers game on Friday.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.563
Wanted to know if
you'd like to go with me.

03:13.564 --> 03:16.266
Why would you think I'd
want to go to a hockey game?

03:16.267 --> 03:18.798
Well, it's cold,
there's a lot of blood...

03:18.799 --> 03:20.870
It's right up your alley.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.902
(Laughs) I will pass. Ask Adam.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.904
No, I can't. He's gone to some
bachelor party in Las Vegas.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.308
This isn't about
the hockey game.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.210
I'm asking you out.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.582
(Sighs)

03:32.583 --> 03:34.213
Tommy...

03:34.214 --> 03:35.785
Don't.

03:35.786 --> 03:38.888
'Cause of something that
happened 20 years ago?

03:38.889 --> 03:42.392
No, because...

03:42.393 --> 03:45.225
Uh... you and me?

03:46.927 --> 03:50.831
(Chuckles) Not a good idea.

03:53.864 --> 03:54.835
(Cell phone rings)

03:54.836 --> 03:57.667
(Second cell phone buzzes)

03:57.668 --> 03:59.809
(Cell phones ring and buzz)

03:59.810 --> 04:00.970
(Cell phones beep)

04:00.971 --> 04:03.743
Megan hunt.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.315
Tommy Sullivan.

04:05.316 --> 04:06.546
(Camera shutter clicks,
police radio chatter)

04:06.547 --> 04:07.877
(Woman) Victim's
name is Melanie summer.

04:07.878 --> 04:09.819
She's a preschool
teacher over at little tree.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.821
It looks like she was
torn apart by an animal.

04:11.822 --> 04:13.483
Or a zombie.

04:13.484 --> 04:16.826
I'd say he was all too human.

04:16.827 --> 04:19.258
That's a fingernail.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.830
Had to be on drugs.

04:20.831 --> 04:22.632
Create this level of mayhem,

04:22.633 --> 04:24.294
not even care that your
fingernails were tearing out?

04:24.295 --> 04:25.495
(Ethan) Maybe it was bath salts.

04:25.496 --> 04:26.836
I mean, those things
really screw you up.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.638
Such a waste.

04:28.639 --> 04:30.269
You know, this
level of violence,

04:30.270 --> 04:31.871
the killer would've
been covered in blood,

04:31.872 --> 04:33.443
yet there's none of it
in the hallway outside.

04:33.444 --> 04:34.844
None in any of the
other rooms either.

04:34.845 --> 04:36.646
It's all centered in here.

04:36.647 --> 04:37.907
So how'd he get away?

04:37.908 --> 04:39.278
(Camera shutter clicks)

04:39.279 --> 04:41.581
It's like he vanished
into thin air.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.882
(Tommy) Oh, so he's
a magical zombie?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.053
I never said that.

04:44.054 --> 04:46.055
That window's open.

04:46.056 --> 04:48.818
No way. We're
on the third floor.

04:48.819 --> 04:51.061
(Radio chatter continues,
people speak indistinctly)

04:52.623 --> 04:54.765
That's quite a jump.

04:56.066 --> 04:59.499
(Police radio chatter)

04:59.500 --> 05:01.030
From the blood
smears, looks like

05:01.031 --> 05:03.903
he broke his leg,
dragged it behind him

05:03.904 --> 05:05.835
as he hobbled away.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.777
(Siren wails)

05:07.778 --> 05:10.911
(Radio chatter continues)

05:15.886 --> 05:17.547
(Tommy) Stay on your toes.

05:17.548 --> 05:20.551
(Radio chatter continues)

05:41.341 --> 05:44.874
(Growling)

05:44.875 --> 05:48.378
What the hell is that?

05:48.379 --> 05:50.520
Police!

05:50.521 --> 05:52.982
Show yourself!

05:52.983 --> 05:56.657
Maybe we should
wait for s.W.A.T.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.863
(Clicks up and down)

06:36.897 --> 06:38.828

(Continues grunting)

06:55.646 --> 06:57.116
Aah!

06:57.117 --> 07:00.189
(Grunting)

07:00.190 --> 07:01.551
Ah!

07:01.552 --> 07:02.822
(Thuds)

07:02.823 --> 07:05.595
(Panting)

07:05.596 --> 07:08.598

(Exhales)

07:18.108 --> 07:20.570
Tommy? You all right?

07:20.571 --> 07:22.773
(Panting)

07:24.745 --> 07:28.818
(Continues panting)

07:28.819 --> 07:32.753
♪♪♪

07:37.457 --> 07:38.658
(Indistinct conversations,
police radio chatter)

07:38.659 --> 07:40.890
(Woman) He's the building super.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.562
Name's Seth boylan.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.863
According to neighbors, he
was the nicest guy in the world.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.536
Well, nice guys
don't try to eat people.

07:46.537 --> 07:48.067
See, what did I
tell you? Zombie.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.769
And you got bit so you're next.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.801
Knock it off, Ethan.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.943
Human bites can be
extremely dangerous,

07:53.944 --> 07:57.547
especially from someone
as sick as boylan is.

07:57.548 --> 07:58.748
(Tommy) Did you say "sick"?

07:58.749 --> 08:00.109
I thought he was just on drugs.

08:00.110 --> 08:03.112
See this foam crusted
around his mouth?

08:03.113 --> 08:05.615
It looks like rabies.

08:05.616 --> 08:08.888
The virus causes the
body to overproduce saliva.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.120
It also explains his
extreme aggression

08:11.121 --> 08:13.663
and hallucinatory behavior.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.665
He probably only had
a few days left to live.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.797
Rabies is fatal?

08:17.798 --> 08:18.828
(Huffs)

08:18.829 --> 08:20.269
(Clicks switch)

08:20.270 --> 08:24.073
Rabies is one of the most
fatal viruses in the world,

08:24.074 --> 08:26.706
which means...

08:26.707 --> 08:29.279
You're gonna need some shots.

08:33.684 --> 08:36.686
(Sighs deeply)

08:36.687 --> 08:38.247
(Keyboard keys clicking)

08:38.248 --> 08:40.519
Hey. How you doing?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.521
I gotta ask.
Wh-what was it like?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.724
What was what like?

08:44.725 --> 08:46.726
Being attacked by a zombie.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.698
No, rabies have been around

08:48.699 --> 08:50.830
since the dawn of man, okay?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.732
And many think its symptomology

08:52.733 --> 08:54.033
is what inspired romero

08:54.034 --> 08:55.705
to create "night
of the living dead."

08:55.706 --> 08:58.537
So I figure, what
you went through

08:58.538 --> 09:00.740
was as close to a
real zombie attack

09:00.741 --> 09:03.573
as any of us could
ever hope to experience.

09:03.574 --> 09:07.046
Don't you have any...
Medical stuff to do, or...

09:07.047 --> 09:08.718
You know, many people tell
me that I'd be the first to die

09:08.719 --> 09:10.049
in a zombie outbreak.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.681
It's not true.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.252
They're wrong.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.585
I have exceptional
survival skills,

09:15.586 --> 09:17.857
keen situational
instincts that alert me

09:17.858 --> 09:20.830
to even the slightest
hint of danger.

09:20.831 --> 09:23.764
What do those instincts
tell you right now?

09:26.697 --> 09:28.738
I'm gonna go... Help Curtis

09:28.739 --> 09:30.700
in the exam.

09:30.701 --> 09:32.201
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.844
Ready for your shots?

09:35.746 --> 09:38.207
There are other doctors
in Philly, you know?

09:38.208 --> 09:40.750
Well, you're the
only one I trust.

09:40.751 --> 09:42.752
(Groans)

09:42.753 --> 09:44.213
On second thought...

09:44.214 --> 09:45.715
Oh, don't be such a baby.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.717
Rabies shots used
to go in the stomach

09:47.718 --> 09:49.859
with a 6-inch needle...

09:49.860 --> 09:51.020
23 of them.

09:51.021 --> 09:54.864
Now it's just five
shots over a week.

09:54.865 --> 09:56.696
(People speaking indistinctly)

09:56.697 --> 09:57.968
What?

09:59.870 --> 10:00.930
What do you mean?

10:00.931 --> 10:02.371
It's antibiotics. It
goes in the butt.

10:02.372 --> 10:04.203
You're serious? Mm-hmm.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.836
You know, you wanted
to see my naked butt,

10:06.837 --> 10:08.307
you coulda said yes
to the flyers game.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.840
Why do you pull your pants
down at sporting events?

10:10.841 --> 10:11.911
(Groans)

10:11.912 --> 10:13.743
Sadly, you'll never know...

10:13.744 --> 10:15.384
(Chuckles) Because
I have another date.

10:15.385 --> 10:18.719
Someone who appreciates
my childlike spirit.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.890
(Knock on door)

10:20.891 --> 10:22.391
We've got trouble.

10:22.392 --> 10:24.393
I've been over boylan's
body with a magnifying glass

10:24.394 --> 10:25.995
and can't find a
single bite Mark.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.197
What's the problem?

10:28.198 --> 10:31.060
Because rabies is almost
always transmitted by bite,

10:31.061 --> 10:32.832
especially in humans.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.233
Then how did he get it?

10:34.234 --> 10:36.866
What if the virus has mutated
into a more virulent form?

10:36.867 --> 10:39.408
I mean, this could be passed
as easily as the common cold.

10:39.409 --> 10:41.040
I mean, we could be headed
towards an "I am legend"

10:41.041 --> 10:42.842
post-apocalyptic hell-pocolypse.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.874
Are you on drugs?

10:44.875 --> 10:46.215
Allergy medication.

10:46.216 --> 10:48.377
Ethan, there is no evidence
of that kind of mutation.

10:48.378 --> 10:51.220
Rabies is a fairly
stable zoonotic virus.

10:51.221 --> 10:52.882
But mutation isn't impossible.

10:52.883 --> 10:55.054
Yeah, viruses
mutate all the time.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.286
But if the rabies virus
had already mutated

10:57.287 --> 10:58.858
to become more infectious,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.860
we'd see more victims.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.832
(People speaking indistinctly)

11:02.833 --> 11:05.735
(Door hisses open)

11:05.736 --> 11:07.967
Morning.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.699
Good morning. Hey.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.870
Hey, frank, good morning.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.171
How are you today?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.843
I'd be better if I
was still asleep.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.144
(Grunts) Aah!

11:15.145 --> 11:16.405
Ah!

11:16.406 --> 11:18.347
Whoa! (Growling)

11:18.348 --> 11:20.449
Ah! Ah! Ah! (Panting)

11:20.450 --> 11:22.712
(Grunts) Get him
off! (Hydraulics hiss)

11:22.713 --> 11:23.813
(Revs engine)

11:23.814 --> 11:25.255
Aah! Aah!

11:26.686 --> 11:28.688
(Growling) (Woman screams)

11:30.390 --> 11:31.892
(Woman screams)

11:33.794 --> 11:37.426
(Growling continues)

11:37.427 --> 11:38.768
(Tires squeal)

11:38.769 --> 11:40.169
(Woman screams) Ah!

11:40.170 --> 11:44.174
(Tires squeal)

11:46.837 --> 11:48.707
(Megan) The symptoms
appear identical.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.879
(Kate) Bite marks?

11:49.880 --> 11:50.880
Not that I could see.

11:50.881 --> 11:52.341
We'll know more
after a full exam.

11:52.342 --> 11:53.943
(Kate) We should consider
making a statement.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.845
It's too soon for that.

11:55.846 --> 11:58.017
But not too soon to call the
new health commissioner.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.089
(Laughs) Stafford.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.421
It's good to see
you again, Megan.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.093
Wish it were better
circumstances.

12:04.094 --> 12:05.424
Oh, who are you kidding?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.757
An outbreak is your
favorite kind of circumstance.

12:07.758 --> 12:09.028
Well, Kate's already briefed me

12:09.029 --> 12:10.830
on the possible rabies mutation.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.201
And I'd like to
close the door on it,

12:12.202 --> 12:13.732
but there's a new
strain of the virus

12:13.733 --> 12:15.734
that's being passed
from foxes and skunks.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.866
It's transmitted passively.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.237
Without biting?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.809
Yes.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.040
I-I'm sorry.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.411
Who are you? Oh...

12:22.412 --> 12:24.043
Tommy Sullivan. Philly p.D.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.414
Right.

12:25.415 --> 12:27.847
The man who put the bullet
hole in Mr. Boylan's head.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.879
Was that really necessary?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.220
The guy tore up a girl.

12:31.221 --> 12:32.852
He was gonna do
the same thing to me.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.354
Of course he did.
He was very sick.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.756
He couldn't control his actions.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.228
Well, I'll tell you what. The
next rabid lunatic pops up,

12:39.229 --> 12:40.429
I'll send him your way.

12:40.430 --> 12:41.931
(Kate) Dr. Stafford is here

12:41.932 --> 12:43.262
to prevent the next attack.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.794
So why don't we get
Mr. Chen's autopsy started

12:44.795 --> 12:46.165
so we can pull the brain

12:46.166 --> 12:47.797
and get a section
for you to examine?

12:47.798 --> 12:49.168
That sounds good to me.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.840
I've been stuck
behind a desk too long.

12:50.841 --> 12:52.471
(Laughs) I want to get
back to doing what I love...

12:52.472 --> 12:54.874
Looking at viruses under
a microscope. (Laughs)

12:54.875 --> 12:56.876
Bet that got you
seriously laid in college.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.377
What was that?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.849
The guy thinks I'm insensitive

12:59.850 --> 13:01.550
to the needs of rabid cannibals.

13:01.551 --> 13:03.112
I don't know. Are you?

13:03.113 --> 13:04.283
Megan, who cares?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.514
Tommy, we need this guy.

13:05.515 --> 13:08.087
So zip it up and play nice...

13:08.088 --> 13:09.519
For once.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.566
(Megan) Norman chen,
38-year-old Asian-American male.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.900
Severe blunt-force trauma
to the right lateral chest,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.402
abdomen, and pelvis.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.904
As with Seth boylan,

13:24.905 --> 13:27.536
reportedly exhibited
signs of agitation

13:27.537 --> 13:29.438
and hallucination

13:29.439 --> 13:32.411
similar to the
"furious rabies" virus.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.483
(Stafford) Oh, it's
definitely rabies.

13:34.484 --> 13:38.387
Those bullet-shaped virions
don't look like anything else.

13:38.388 --> 13:41.120
Mm. Hello, beautiful.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.591
You admire them?

13:42.592 --> 13:44.123
(Huffs) Of course I do.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.595
Rabies is the oldest
virus known to man.

13:46.596 --> 13:49.398
Aristotle wrote
about it in 300 b.C.

13:49.399 --> 13:50.599
Totally unique.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.601
Doesn't enter the body
through the bloodstream.

13:52.602 --> 13:54.904
Travels through
the nervous system.

13:54.905 --> 13:56.165
Is that why the incubation times

13:56.166 --> 13:57.336
vary so wildly?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.537
Exactly.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.539
Anywhere from a few
days to several years.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.541
Depends on how close
to the brain the bite is

14:02.542 --> 14:05.514
and how fast the infection
travels through the neurons.

14:05.515 --> 14:06.946
And when it reaches the brain,

14:06.947 --> 14:08.317
it spreads like wildfire.

14:08.318 --> 14:09.578
Yeah.

14:09.579 --> 14:11.620
Aggression redlines,
inhibitions disappear,

14:11.621 --> 14:13.352
salivation increases.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.184
Then comes the hydrophobia.

14:15.185 --> 14:16.325
Fear of water?

14:16.326 --> 14:18.227
(Scoffs) More than just a fear.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.229
At the height of the
infection, a rabies victim

14:20.230 --> 14:23.632
will react violently to the
sight or sound of water.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.365
They vomit, lash out,
they go into convulsions.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.497
At that point, only got
a few days left to live.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.970
Yeah, and those days
are spent in madness,

14:30.971 --> 14:32.972
with the disease
trying to pass itself on

14:32.973 --> 14:35.174
through spasms of
aggression and biting.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.545
So cool.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.608
It's good to have
you back, Stafford.

14:42.082 --> 14:45.655
Yeah, excuse me for a sec.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.020
(People speaking indistinctly)

14:51.021 --> 14:52.421
What are you doing here?

14:52.422 --> 14:54.663
Murray and wasik ran
down the information

14:54.664 --> 14:56.525
you asked for on
the rabies victims.

14:56.526 --> 14:58.527
I volunteered to bring
it over after my shift.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.599
Wanted to check on
you. She's hot, huh?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.571
Excuse me?

15:02.572 --> 15:04.573
You feel responsible
for what happened.

15:04.574 --> 15:06.475
A little.

15:06.476 --> 15:07.606
Don't.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.608
It was my call to split up.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.610
(Exhales)

15:11.611 --> 15:13.282
So what did they
bring in on our Vic?

15:13.283 --> 15:15.084
You think I read their
report on the way over?

15:15.085 --> 15:16.545
So you didn't?

15:16.546 --> 15:19.918
Chen and boylan couldn't
have led more different lives.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.151
There's no single apparent
connection between them,

15:22.152 --> 15:24.393
geographically or socially.

15:24.394 --> 15:26.925
So how the hell'd
they both get infected?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.397
In theory, there's
someone else out there

15:28.398 --> 15:29.628
carrying the disease.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.961
An index case or patient zero.

15:31.962 --> 15:33.562
Chen and boylan got it
from him independently.

15:33.563 --> 15:34.933
Index case?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.405
You're pretty smart for a cop.

15:36.406 --> 15:38.707
Can you say
that a little louder?

15:38.708 --> 15:40.109
(Laughs)

15:40.110 --> 15:41.640
Thanks for bringing this over.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.142
Sure.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.314
(People speak indistinctly)

15:45.315 --> 15:46.546
(Door opens)

15:51.721 --> 15:53.252
What'd she have?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.154
Uh, some info on
chen and boylan.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.655
Apparently they're not related.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.657
I told her there must
be a patient zero

15:58.658 --> 16:00.589
running around out
there somewhere.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.192
Well, there is no patient zero.

16:03.193 --> 16:04.533
The rabies virus
these gentlemen have

16:04.534 --> 16:05.594
is the standard virus.

16:05.595 --> 16:07.136
No mutation whatsoever.

16:07.137 --> 16:08.737
Then how the hell
did he get infected

16:08.738 --> 16:10.099
if he wasn't bitten?

16:10.100 --> 16:11.071
(Stafford) Gonna have
to do some more tests.

16:11.072 --> 16:12.241
Wait, wait.

16:12.242 --> 16:13.742
Hold on.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.174
What is it?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.577
Traces of gauze and
adhesive. I saw it earlier.

16:19.549 --> 16:20.579
An eye patch?

16:20.580 --> 16:21.980
He must have ripped it off

16:21.981 --> 16:24.214
in the throes of the infection.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.256
I believe that Mr. Chen

16:27.257 --> 16:30.359
has had a recent
cornea transplant.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.660
Of course.

16:31.661 --> 16:34.094
What about boylan?

16:35.495 --> 16:36.995
(Instruments clatter)

16:36.996 --> 16:38.497
(Tommy) Wait. What's going on?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.169
Skin graft to protect a burn.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.301
I noted it during autopsy.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.502
That explains everything.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.175
Including the accelerated
incubation period.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.337
Could you guys please tell
me what you're talking about?

16:48.338 --> 16:50.079
We know how both
men contracted rabies...

16:50.080 --> 16:51.710
Diseased donor tissue...

16:51.711 --> 16:54.283
Both boylan's skin graft
and chen's new cornea.

16:54.284 --> 16:57.046
So there's an organ donor
out there who's got rabies?

16:57.047 --> 16:59.088
No. Organ transplants
come from the living.

16:59.089 --> 17:00.549
Tissue transplants
from cadavers...

17:00.550 --> 17:03.422
Things like corneas,
skin, tendons...

17:03.423 --> 17:04.723
Heart valves, veins, even bones.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.425
Yep, all of these are
harvested from bodies

17:06.426 --> 17:07.696
after their dead,

17:07.697 --> 17:09.558
and then transplanted
into living patients.

17:09.559 --> 17:10.699
So instead of patient zero,

17:10.700 --> 17:12.431
we're talking
about cadaver zero.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.732
Right.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.434
And just to be clear,
this is a good thing, right?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.635
Wrong.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.107
A single infected cadaver

17:18.108 --> 17:20.739
could contaminate hundreds
of transplant recipients,

17:20.740 --> 17:22.741
all unaware that they've
just contracted rabies.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.743
Which means there
could be hundreds

17:24.744 --> 17:26.515
of walking time bombs out there,

17:26.516 --> 17:30.049
just... Waiting to go off.

17:37.427 --> 17:40.089
We've issued warnings to
all the local medical facilities.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.590
The problem is,

17:41.591 --> 17:43.432
cadaver zero's infected
tissue could've been shipped

17:43.433 --> 17:45.434
to clinics, hospitals
all over the country.

17:45.435 --> 17:47.766
Is there some kind of oversight
agency that could help?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.298
In theory, it's the f.D.A.

17:49.299 --> 17:50.639
The reality is,

17:50.640 --> 17:53.472
tissue harvesting is a
barely regulated industry.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.803
In order to become
a licensed harvester,

17:54.804 --> 17:57.246
all you have to do is
fill out a form online.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.807
It takes the f.D.A.
Years to check it out,

17:58.808 --> 18:00.349
they're so backed up. Years?

18:00.350 --> 18:03.081
About two million products
derived from human tissue

18:03.082 --> 18:04.383
are sold in the U.S.
alone every year.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.654
Yep, the cash is ridiculous.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.786
You can profit $100,000
on one cadaver.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.558
I'm in the wrong line of work.

18:09.559 --> 18:11.860
We've gotta find a
way to locate that tissue.

18:11.861 --> 18:13.562
Every hour that passes
reduces our chances

18:13.563 --> 18:15.093
of stopping a rabies outbreak.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.095
You know, we
could test the d.N.A.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.727
On the transplanted cornea.

18:18.728 --> 18:21.830
Yeah, cadaver zero's
tissue is still in the transplant.

18:21.831 --> 18:23.502
Exactly, and then
we just have to hope

18:23.503 --> 18:25.304
the d.N.A. Is
already in c.O.D.I.S.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.775
That's brilliant.

18:26.776 --> 18:28.307
(Chuckles) Eh, just a little.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.339
Looks like the doctors
who treated chen and boylan

18:30.340 --> 18:31.740
received their tissue
from the same source...

18:31.741 --> 18:33.812
A company called
bio-gen incorporated.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.185
All right, time for a house
call. You want to come?

18:36.186 --> 18:37.846
No, I'm gonna stick
here with Charlie

18:37.847 --> 18:40.189
and follow up on
that d.N.A. Lead.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.790
Ah, no. He's got plenty
of important stuff to do.

18:41.791 --> 18:44.353
He's got to run a
health department, right?

18:44.354 --> 18:45.524
No.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.825
No, actually, right
here is the, uh,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.757
best place for me right now.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.160
Right. Yeah. (Kate)
Well, you should definitely

18:51.161 --> 18:52.501
have a doctor
with you at bio-gen.

18:52.502 --> 18:54.303
I'm coming along.
I'll get my stuff.

18:54.304 --> 18:55.764
Good luck.

18:55.765 --> 18:57.406
Good hunting.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.669
(Indistinct conversations)

19:01.771 --> 19:03.742
So what's the deal
with Stafford anyway?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.614
What do you mean? He's
the health commissioner.

19:05.615 --> 19:07.616
And you really should try
not to antagonize the guy.

19:07.617 --> 19:09.218
Yeah, but he's kind of a tool.

19:09.219 --> 19:10.749
Why does Megan like him?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.421
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:12.422 --> 19:14.553
Well, she didn't, at first.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.225
They butted heads
when the c.D.C.

19:16.226 --> 19:17.726
Sent him in on the
marburg outbreak.

19:17.727 --> 19:19.758
But I guess working
together bonded 'em.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.232
What do you mean, they bonded?

19:23.463 --> 19:24.793
All right, you know how
Megan always thinks

19:24.794 --> 19:25.934
she's the smartest
person in the room?

19:25.935 --> 19:27.796
Well, Stafford...
Challenges her.

19:27.797 --> 19:29.798
It makes her raise her game.

19:29.799 --> 19:31.770
Women like that.

19:31.771 --> 19:35.474
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

19:35.475 --> 19:37.206
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:37.207 --> 19:38.847
(Stafford) Ooh.

19:38.848 --> 19:41.810
Nice.

19:41.811 --> 19:44.353
So what's the deal
with officer badass?

19:44.354 --> 19:45.854
Tommy?

19:45.855 --> 19:47.716
Um...

19:47.717 --> 19:48.887
(Sets glasses down)

19:48.888 --> 19:50.559
He's a little rough
around the edges, but...

19:50.560 --> 19:51.720
(Closes lid)

19:51.721 --> 19:53.392
He's good at what he does.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.864
Seems a little
trigger-happy to me.

19:55.865 --> 19:58.267
He takes things personally.

19:58.268 --> 20:00.799
It's his weakness
and his strength.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.830
From what I remember,

20:01.831 --> 20:03.832
you take things personally, too.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.305
You saying that
Tommy and I are alike?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.936
No, you're much better looking.

20:07.937 --> 20:09.908
(Chuckles)

20:09.909 --> 20:13.882
Get this to the lab.
They're expecting it.

20:13.883 --> 20:16.885
So how the hell did you
end up health commissioner?

20:16.886 --> 20:19.588
You never struck me
as the bureaucratic type.

20:19.589 --> 20:21.790
Well, a year ago I
would've agreed with you.

20:21.791 --> 20:23.792
Then I realized how
much good I can do

20:23.793 --> 20:27.396
by formulating this
state's health policy.

20:27.397 --> 20:29.558
(Imitates snoring)

20:29.559 --> 20:30.859
Okay, fine. (Chuckles)

20:30.860 --> 20:34.463
It, uh, it has been a
bit of an adjustment...

20:34.464 --> 20:35.804
A big one.

20:35.805 --> 20:38.707
But, um, it's fulfilling.

20:38.708 --> 20:41.239
Although it's been pretty nice

20:41.240 --> 20:43.312
getting back in the trenches...

20:43.313 --> 20:45.375
With you.

20:47.877 --> 20:49.778
(Man) There must
be some mistake.

20:49.779 --> 20:50.919
Our tissue can't
have been the source

20:50.920 --> 20:52.451
of this rabies infection.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.952
Every cadaver that we harvest

20:53.953 --> 20:56.485
has its blood tested
for infectious diseases.

20:56.486 --> 20:58.327
Rabies isn't
present in the blood,

20:58.328 --> 20:59.858
so a blood test is useless.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.860
Well, that is all the
f.D.A. Mandates.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.392
Why don't you tell
that to the parents

21:03.393 --> 21:04.733
of the young woman
who was murdered

21:04.734 --> 21:06.034
because of your infected tissue?

21:06.035 --> 21:07.536
The most important
thing right now

21:07.537 --> 21:08.997
is to make sure that
no one else is infected.

21:08.998 --> 21:11.300
So we need to know exactly
where the rest of that tissue went.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.672
It didn't go anywhere.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.844
Thank god.

21:15.845 --> 21:17.746
Cadaver zero's
tissue is right in here.

21:17.747 --> 21:19.648
We're going to need
to take it with us.

21:19.649 --> 21:21.650
I can get a
warrant if I have to.

21:21.651 --> 21:23.452
That won't be necessary.

21:23.453 --> 21:24.953
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:24.954 --> 21:26.616
(Door closes)

21:30.890 --> 21:32.491
What's she doing?

21:32.492 --> 21:35.794
A body without bones could
be disturbing for the family,

21:35.795 --> 21:37.796
so they replace
'em with p.V.C. Pipe.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.628
That's just so wrong.

21:39.629 --> 21:40.899
Here it is.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.403
Cadaver zero's blood
sample and tissue.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.734
Great.

21:45.735 --> 21:47.806
Now we just need his
name and vital information.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.779
I'm afraid I don't
actually have that.

21:50.780 --> 21:51.940
What the hell do you mean?

21:51.941 --> 21:53.482
You have to understand,

21:53.483 --> 21:55.884
the demand for harvested
tissue is at a record high.

21:55.885 --> 21:58.347
My in-house personnel
are overwhelmed.

21:58.348 --> 21:59.848
So I outsource some
of my harvesting

21:59.849 --> 22:01.820
to subcontractors.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.852
Uh, they hustle
their own cadavers.

22:03.853 --> 22:05.554
They, uh, harvest
the bodies off-site,

22:05.555 --> 22:07.426
then they sell the tissue to me.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.528
C-Cadaver zero was one of those.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.431
And you didn't require
an I.D. For the body?

22:12.432 --> 22:13.932
Of course we did.
There are forms.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.434
But when I pulled the paperwork,

22:15.435 --> 22:16.865
it was incomplete.

22:16.866 --> 22:18.006
(Scoffs) Somebody
should've noticed,

22:18.007 --> 22:19.638
they didn't, and I apologize.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.710
Oh, you apologize?
Three people are dead.

22:21.711 --> 22:23.872
I'm close to bringing
you in as an accessory.

22:23.873 --> 22:25.874
This is a simple clerical error.

22:25.875 --> 22:28.917
I can give you the person
who harvested the body.

22:28.918 --> 22:30.719
His name is Ken dobannis.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.120
There's a copy of
his harvesting license

22:32.121 --> 22:33.622
in my office,

22:33.623 --> 22:34.883
and his address will be on it.

22:34.884 --> 22:37.887
(Sighs)

22:47.537 --> 22:48.797
(Engine turns off)

22:48.798 --> 22:51.771
(Keys jangle)

22:55.104 --> 22:57.846
Clearly the address on
Ken dobannis' license

22:57.847 --> 22:59.878
is a fake.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.451
(Blows air)

23:02.452 --> 23:05.915
I got a bad feeling about this.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.519
We got a problem.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.522
The lab found a match
on cadaver zero's d.N.A.

23:13.523 --> 23:14.993
He's a 21-year-old
college student

23:14.994 --> 23:16.865
named Brian Ellis.

23:16.866 --> 23:17.996
When did he die?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.528
No idea.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.500
What do you mean? It's
a matter of public record.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.702
Brian Ellis is currently
listed as a missing person.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.903
According to police,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.935
he was abducted off the
streets three weeks ago.

23:26.936 --> 23:28.537
Now call me crazy,

23:28.538 --> 23:30.880
but I think this kid
was murdered for parts.

23:44.153 --> 23:47.456
I-I can't believe
he's really dead.

23:47.457 --> 23:49.758
We think he had rabies
when he was abducted.

23:49.759 --> 23:51.059
Were you aware
that he was bitten?

23:51.060 --> 23:54.202
Uh, yeah. A stray dog
a few weeks before...

23:54.203 --> 23:55.864
Mm-hmm. But the bite wasn't bad,

23:55.865 --> 23:58.967
and it's not like he had the
money to go to the doctor.

23:58.968 --> 24:01.840
The police report says
you were both drinking

24:01.841 --> 24:03.672
the night he was taken.

24:03.673 --> 24:04.913
Yeah.

24:04.914 --> 24:06.575
As we were walking
home, Brian thought

24:06.576 --> 24:08.046
we were being
followed by a black car.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.149
It sped off as soon
as I turned around.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.521
(People speaking indistinctly)

24:12.522 --> 24:14.523
Brian said he saw it earlier

24:14.524 --> 24:16.725
on the way to the bar.

24:16.726 --> 24:19.087
We laughed it off as paranoia.

24:19.088 --> 24:21.930
I stopped to throw up, and...

24:21.931 --> 24:24.593
He went on ahead.

24:24.594 --> 24:28.166
Suddenly, he was
screaming my name.

24:28.167 --> 24:32.741
And as I came around
the corner, he was gone.

24:32.742 --> 24:35.244
The black car was speeding away.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.146
Okay, here's what we got...

24:38.147 --> 24:40.208
Brian Ellis was
abducted off the streets

24:40.209 --> 24:42.981
by a black car, make
and model unknown.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.084
Two days later, bio-gen
purchased Ellis' tissue

24:46.085 --> 24:49.017
from a licensed subcontractor
named Ken dobannis.

24:49.018 --> 24:51.089
Now the harvesting
license is real,

24:51.090 --> 24:53.091
but the name and address
used to obtain it are not.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.923
(Woman) So this dobannis
guy kidnapped and killed Ellis

24:54.924 --> 24:56.264
for his tissue?

24:56.265 --> 24:57.796
Plenty of people have
been killed for a lot less

24:57.797 --> 25:00.498
than the $100,000
a body can generate.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.070
Well, a young male like Ellis...

25:02.071 --> 25:04.072
That could generate a
lot more than 100 grand.

25:04.073 --> 25:06.735
Young bodies, they're
harder to come by.

25:06.736 --> 25:08.937
Not if you kill them yourself.

25:08.938 --> 25:10.639
(Kate) But why target Ellis?

25:10.640 --> 25:12.110
I mean, according
to his roommate,

25:12.111 --> 25:13.812
the car had been following
them earlier in the evening,

25:13.813 --> 25:15.283
so he was clearly targeted.

25:15.284 --> 25:17.115
But why not just go after
somebody who's walking alone?

25:17.116 --> 25:18.087
That's a good question.

25:18.088 --> 25:19.247
We've been
picking apart his life

25:19.248 --> 25:20.719
trying to find an
answer to that.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.190
Why Ken dobannis?

25:22.191 --> 25:23.892
What do you mean?

25:23.893 --> 25:25.994
It's a particular name.

25:25.995 --> 25:30.128
Why not Joe Smith
or Tom Jackson?

25:30.129 --> 25:31.660
(Stafford) You think it
has some significance?

25:31.661 --> 25:33.902
Well, he's not stupid enough

25:33.903 --> 25:36.064
to pick a name that
will lead us to him.

25:36.065 --> 25:38.236
He's not stupid. I
think he's very clever.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.269
So clever, he
wants us to know it.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.011
An anagram.

25:43.012 --> 25:45.214
Exactly.

25:57.987 --> 25:59.959
(Chuckles)

26:03.332 --> 26:08.237
"Skin and bone."

26:10.670 --> 26:12.901
How can my department help?

26:12.902 --> 26:15.103
Well, the m.E.'S office
has Ellis' remains.

26:15.104 --> 26:17.045
What are the odds
that this harvester

26:17.046 --> 26:20.078
left some trace evidence
that will lead us back to him?

26:20.079 --> 26:23.151
Well, it's a long shot,
but we'll do our best.

26:23.152 --> 26:24.783
All right. We got work to do.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.116
I got a feeling Brian Ellis
is just the tip of the iceberg.

26:28.117 --> 26:32.120
(Plastic crinkling)

26:32.121 --> 26:36.195
♪♪♪

26:47.376 --> 26:50.640
(Video playing without audio)

27:22.071 --> 27:25.013
(Megan) I found
something anomalous.

27:25.014 --> 27:27.215
Traces of
high-index cavity fluid

27:27.216 --> 27:29.978
on the leg bones
harvested from Brian's body.

27:29.979 --> 27:31.920
Cavity fluid's only
used for embalming.

27:31.921 --> 27:33.081
Exactly.

27:33.082 --> 27:34.152
Any type of formaldehyde

27:34.153 --> 27:36.054
would degrade the
tissue being harvested.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.386
Add to that the fact that
at Brian's abduction site

27:38.387 --> 27:40.188
there was a hearse...

27:40.189 --> 27:42.761
I think this guy harvested
Brian Ellis at a funeral home.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.232
Except Brian Ellis
wasn't the only one

27:44.233 --> 27:46.234
who was harvested there.

27:46.235 --> 27:48.396
Five male college students
in the last two months

27:48.397 --> 27:51.269
in the Philadelphia area
have been reported missing,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.141
including one who
disappeared a week ago

27:53.142 --> 27:54.843
by the name of Michael Finley.

27:54.844 --> 27:56.975
Why didn't the police
make the connection?

27:56.976 --> 27:58.376
There's no
evidence of foul play.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.149
College students aren't known
for being particularly stable.

28:01.150 --> 28:02.781
That's no excuse.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.682
Your failure to
connect those dots

28:04.683 --> 28:07.055
allowed this killer to prey
on young men with impunity.

28:07.056 --> 28:09.057
You believe that,
you're not living in reality.

28:09.058 --> 28:10.188
Okay, boys, knock it off.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.190
You can blame each
other later, okay?

28:12.191 --> 28:13.992
We need to find the funeral home

28:13.993 --> 28:15.293
that this guy's operating out of

28:15.294 --> 28:17.125
before he kills somebody else.

28:17.126 --> 28:18.466
(Curtis) Megan.

28:18.467 --> 28:20.969
The cavity fluid you
turned up is a brand

28:20.970 --> 28:23.171
the f.D.A. Banned
eight years ago.

28:23.172 --> 28:25.433
No active funeral
home is using this stuff.

28:25.434 --> 28:27.976
So maybe he's using
a shuttered facility.

28:27.977 --> 28:29.137
I'll call in for a list.

28:29.138 --> 28:31.009
Slow your roll,
Columbo. I got this.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.842
There's only one closed
funeral home still standing,

28:33.843 --> 28:37.846
and it's less than a mile
from five college campuses.

28:37.847 --> 28:39.187
(Indistinct conversations)

28:39.188 --> 28:41.189
There's no way I can talk
you into staying outside

28:41.190 --> 28:42.891
until we get the
building clear, is there?

28:42.892 --> 28:44.492
Not if the Finley boy
is possibly alive inside.

28:44.493 --> 28:47.996
Listen, Brian Ellis was
harvested after two days.

28:47.997 --> 28:50.358
Michael Finley's
been gone for a week.

28:50.359 --> 28:52.500
(Police radio chatter)

28:52.501 --> 28:54.333
Let's go.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.467
(Hinges squeak)

29:43.552 --> 29:46.856
Oh, god. Finley.

29:52.922 --> 29:56.395
Building's empty.
Harvester must have left.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.201
You knew he was gonna be dead,

30:03.202 --> 30:06.204
right?

30:06.205 --> 30:09.277
But I hoped he wasn't.

30:09.278 --> 30:10.438
Detective.

30:10.439 --> 30:11.809
Yeah?

30:11.810 --> 30:14.482
You need to see what's out back.

30:14.483 --> 30:17.486
(Indistinct conversations)

30:19.388 --> 30:22.391
(Police radio chatter)

30:45.945 --> 30:47.215
(Tommy) So the guy's not
just carving up bodies for cash.

30:47.216 --> 30:49.117
(Indistinct conversations)
He's a serial killer.

30:49.118 --> 30:50.949
He's figured out a way to monetize
his psychopathy. (Machinery whirring)

30:50.950 --> 30:53.521
That's a new one...
Sick and enterprising.

30:53.522 --> 30:55.924
If he was just preying
on college kids for cash,

30:55.925 --> 30:58.456
his victims would
be more diverse.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.589
But these are all young
males, same height, same build,

31:01.590 --> 31:03.932
same hair color.

31:03.933 --> 31:05.163
(Megan) Except for Brian Ellis.

31:05.164 --> 31:07.896
He's got brown hair. All
the others were blond.

31:07.897 --> 31:09.367
Could mean something.
Could mean nothing.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.899
Won't know until we find out

31:10.900 --> 31:12.400
exactly what
makes this guy tick.

31:12.401 --> 31:14.142
Why risk the exposure

31:14.143 --> 31:15.944
by selling the tissue

31:15.945 --> 31:17.305
of your victims?

31:17.306 --> 31:18.977
Well, you said he
thinks he's clever.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.149
He's probably daring
us to try to catch him.

31:21.150 --> 31:22.450
Look what I found.

31:22.451 --> 31:24.282
Gotta be at least
60 grand in here.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.954
Probably money
from his last harvest.

31:25.955 --> 31:28.016
Gonna make it
harder for him to run.

31:28.017 --> 31:29.417
No.

31:29.418 --> 31:31.960
He's probably got multiple
harvesting licenses.

31:31.961 --> 31:34.923
All he's gotta do
to bring in cash...

31:34.924 --> 31:37.095
Harvest another victim.

beautiful about this, doc?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.361
No.

32:13.362 --> 32:15.463
Can I ask you a question?

32:15.464 --> 32:17.435
Sure.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.337
What are you still doing here?

32:19.338 --> 32:21.539
This isn't a health
crisis anymore.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.041
It's a police matter.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.673
I'm invested in the outcome.

32:25.674 --> 32:27.315
What outcome?

32:27.316 --> 32:29.947
The outcome of this case.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.981
What else could I possibly mean?

32:32.982 --> 32:35.683
You're a smart guy, doc.
You can figure that out.

32:35.684 --> 32:38.727
(People speaking indistinctly)

32:40.189 --> 32:42.991
'Cause of death was
the same in every victim...

32:42.992 --> 32:45.133
(Sighs) Exsanguination
due to laceration

32:45.134 --> 32:47.335
of the carotid artery.

32:47.336 --> 32:48.966
So he cut their throats.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.298
They bled out in under a minute.

32:50.299 --> 32:51.569
Yeah, but he didn't
kill them right away.

32:51.570 --> 32:52.700
He tortured them first.

32:52.701 --> 32:54.302
From the bruising
around the neck

32:54.303 --> 32:55.973
and the petechial hemorrhaging,

32:55.974 --> 32:58.006
I'd say that he
manually strangled them

32:58.007 --> 32:59.977
to the point of asphyxiation

32:59.978 --> 33:02.010
multiple times

33:02.011 --> 33:03.681
before ending their lives.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.583
Why in the hell
would he do that?

33:05.584 --> 33:06.754
Make him feel powerful.

33:06.755 --> 33:08.616
Bring 'em to death's
door, spare them...

33:08.617 --> 33:10.988
Literally hold their
lives in his hands.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.320
How long did he keep 'em alive?

33:12.321 --> 33:14.292
Somewhere between
10 and 12 hours.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.394
I got something.

33:16.395 --> 33:17.695
Remember the clean blood sample

33:17.696 --> 33:19.767
that the harvester
sent to bio-gen?

33:19.768 --> 33:21.699
Well, I wondered where
he got it so I started to think,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.631
maybe it was his own blood.

33:23.632 --> 33:25.233
So I ran d.N.A. On it.

33:25.234 --> 33:27.075
Ethan, if you found
this guy, I will kiss you.

33:27.076 --> 33:29.006
Really? 'Cause, uh...

33:29.007 --> 33:30.108
Ethan.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.309
Right, no. It didn't
I.D. The killer.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.640
But it did match
a college student

33:32.641 --> 33:34.182
that went missing
over a year ago

33:34.183 --> 33:35.783
in Arizona.

33:35.784 --> 33:37.645
(Stafford) Arizona?

33:37.646 --> 33:39.587
So what, this guy's
been harvesting bodies

33:39.588 --> 33:40.748
across the country?

33:40.749 --> 33:41.720
Looks like it.

33:41.721 --> 33:43.091
Wait a minute.

33:43.092 --> 33:44.422
I've seen Arizona
somewhere in this case.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.023
Where?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.056
Brian Ellis' roommate
Mason geary.

33:48.057 --> 33:51.029
He transferred here
from a school in Arizona.

33:56.705 --> 33:58.137
(Clinks)

34:00.569 --> 34:02.140
Excuse me.

34:02.141 --> 34:05.313
Can you help me? I-I can't
seem to get this to turn.

34:05.314 --> 34:06.814
Sure.

34:06.815 --> 34:08.817
Thank you.

34:10.219 --> 34:11.549
(Crackles)

34:11.550 --> 34:12.750
(Grunts)

34:12.751 --> 34:14.283
(Grunt)

34:17.726 --> 34:20.158
(Tommy) The victim's
name is Shawn Asher.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.829
He left soccer practice at 7:30.

34:21.830 --> 34:24.061
Never made it back
to his dorm room.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.195
We traced his cell phone
to a garbage can on campus.

34:27.196 --> 34:28.536
Mason must have dumped it

34:28.537 --> 34:30.368
knowing we'd use it to find him.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.769
He fits the profile...

34:31.770 --> 34:34.842
Athletic, blond, young.

34:34.843 --> 34:36.374
Just like the rest
of his victims,

34:36.375 --> 34:37.705
except for Brian Ellis.

34:37.706 --> 34:40.248
Now our assumption is
that Brian started to catch on

34:40.249 --> 34:41.749
to some of his
roommate's activity,

34:41.750 --> 34:43.281
Mason had to kill him.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.712
Set up the abduction scenario.

34:44.713 --> 34:46.654
Made it look as
real as possible.

34:46.655 --> 34:49.086
Any ideas as to why
Mason is so focused

34:49.087 --> 34:50.758
on this type of victim?

34:50.759 --> 34:53.461
Officer Dunn, you know
more about this than I do.

34:53.462 --> 34:54.822
Mason geary was a foster kid

34:54.823 --> 34:57.094
who grew up bouncing
from home to home.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.227
According to social services,

34:59.228 --> 35:00.868
when Mason was 8,

35:00.869 --> 35:03.231
he was regularly brutalized
by the biological son

35:03.232 --> 35:04.802
of his foster parents...

35:04.803 --> 35:06.774
A blond college
athlete living at home

35:06.775 --> 35:08.876
who enjoyed beating
the crap out of Mason.

35:08.877 --> 35:10.578
Part of that abuse

35:10.579 --> 35:13.141
involved strangling him
into unconsciousness.

35:13.142 --> 35:14.642
I see.

35:14.643 --> 35:16.544
Now by the time social
services found out about it

35:16.545 --> 35:17.885
and moved him
to a different home,

35:17.886 --> 35:19.487
the damage had
already been done, so...

35:19.488 --> 35:21.319
How did he learn
about harvesting?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.591
An anatomy class
at Arizona tech.

35:23.592 --> 35:25.653
Harvesting tissue was
part of the curriculum.

35:25.654 --> 35:27.725
That's just great.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.157
Okay.

35:29.158 --> 35:30.898
He's not gonna kill Shawn
and then harvest him.

35:30.899 --> 35:32.600
He's got a ritual.

35:32.601 --> 35:34.602
He'll strangle him repeatedly
before cutting his throat,

35:34.603 --> 35:37.265
and he needs a safe
place to perform that.

35:37.266 --> 35:38.566
I agree.

35:38.567 --> 35:39.907
And the clock already
started ticking on this ritual

35:39.908 --> 35:41.439
two hours ago.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.211
We got a very short
window to figure out

35:43.212 --> 35:45.142
where this safe place is
and to stop Shawn Asher

35:45.143 --> 35:48.176
from becoming the
harvester's next victim.

35:48.177 --> 35:50.248
(People speak indistinctly)

35:50.249 --> 35:51.419
(Man whimpers)

35:51.420 --> 35:53.281
(Chains rattling)

35:53.282 --> 35:55.283
(Pants)

35:55.284 --> 35:58.827
(Grunting)

36:01.790 --> 36:04.161
(Panting)

36:04.162 --> 36:05.864
(Grunts)

36:16.805 --> 36:19.907
Oh, g...

36:19.908 --> 36:22.380
(exhales)

36:22.381 --> 36:25.384
(People speaking indistinctly)

36:27.656 --> 36:28.886
You all right?

36:28.887 --> 36:29.887
No, I'm not.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.890
We need to find
that kid... alive,

36:32.891 --> 36:36.824
'cause I cannot look at
another dead boy today.

36:36.825 --> 36:38.866
(Inhales)

36:38.867 --> 36:40.669
(Exhales deeply)

36:42.301 --> 36:43.831
(Huffs)

36:43.832 --> 36:46.905
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

36:51.940 --> 36:53.341
(Pants)

36:53.342 --> 36:54.682
(Rattles chains)

36:54.683 --> 36:56.213
(Crying)

36:56.214 --> 36:59.747
Now you know how it feels...

36:59.748 --> 37:01.619
To be powerless...

37:01.620 --> 37:02.920
(Continues crying)

37:02.921 --> 37:04.792
And scared.

37:04.793 --> 37:07.796
(Continues crying)

37:11.560 --> 37:13.631
(Coughs)

37:13.632 --> 37:15.803
(Grunts)

37:15.804 --> 37:18.667
(Grunt)

37:29.318 --> 37:30.648
Did you find anything?

37:30.649 --> 37:32.850
Nothing yet.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.023
We're running out of time.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.729
Wait a second.

37:41.730 --> 37:42.860
What is it?

37:42.861 --> 37:44.892
It's a paystub.

37:44.893 --> 37:47.365
Mason had a short-term
job doing night security

37:47.366 --> 37:50.498
at a campus storage facility?

37:50.499 --> 37:52.770
This has gotta be where
he's keeping Shawn Asher.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.342
Come on. Let's go.

37:54.343 --> 37:55.503
(Rattles chains)

37:55.504 --> 37:57.675
(Grunting)

37:57.676 --> 38:00.879
It's time to die now, Shawn.

38:03.552 --> 38:05.613
Don't be sad.

38:05.614 --> 38:08.456
(Crying)

38:08.457 --> 38:10.988
You're about to become

38:10.989 --> 38:13.521
so much more than you are.

38:13.522 --> 38:16.394
(Continues crying)

38:16.395 --> 38:18.726
Drop the scalpel.

38:18.727 --> 38:19.798
(Whimpers)

38:21.630 --> 38:23.471
You're not gonna shoot me.

38:23.472 --> 38:24.832
(Whimpers)

38:24.833 --> 38:26.334
One flick of my wrist,

38:26.335 --> 38:28.706
and Shawn's carotid
artery is severed.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.539
He bleeds out in
seconds. (Crying)

38:31.540 --> 38:34.712
Have you ever heard of the
medulla oblongata, Mason?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.514
(Continues crying)

38:36.515 --> 38:39.687
It's where your spine
connects to your brain stem.

38:39.688 --> 38:41.749
Sniper school, we
call it the apricot.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.951
You clip that with a bullet,

38:43.952 --> 38:46.024
it's lights out.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.798
If you're trying to scare me,

38:50.799 --> 38:53.060
it's not gonna work.

38:53.061 --> 38:55.833
No, I'm not trying to scare you.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.004
I'm just telling you,

38:57.005 --> 38:59.837
the only one who's
gonna bleed out in here...

38:59.838 --> 39:01.810
It's you.

39:04.012 --> 39:06.414
(Whimpers)

39:06.415 --> 39:08.416
(Crying)

39:08.417 --> 39:09.547
(Gunshot)

39:09.548 --> 39:10.678
(Thuds)

39:10.679 --> 39:12.880
You're gonna be
all right, Shawn.

39:12.881 --> 39:16.624
(Continues crying)

39:16.625 --> 39:20.028
(Rattling)

39:21.660 --> 39:23.761
(Continues crying) Okay.
Are you okay, Shawn?

39:23.762 --> 39:25.893
You all right? Okay.

39:25.894 --> 39:27.395
Hold on. Hold on to
me. Hold on to me.

39:27.396 --> 39:29.096
Can you walk? Come on. (Panting)

39:29.097 --> 39:31.369
Try to walk.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.867
(Indistinct conversations)

39:59.868 --> 40:00.928
I spoke to the mayor.

40:00.929 --> 40:02.770
I told him how
impressed I was with you,

40:02.771 --> 40:04.602
your entire staff.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.804
Having you on the job
makes my life a lot easier.

40:06.805 --> 40:07.975
Thank you.

40:07.976 --> 40:09.737
And I hope we can
keep calling on you

40:09.738 --> 40:11.479
whenever we need
an expert virologist.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.140
Yeah, get you out
from behind that desk

40:13.141 --> 40:14.942
that you love so much.

40:14.943 --> 40:17.414
Well, I look forward to that.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.686
Mm. (Elevator bell dings)

40:18.687 --> 40:21.519
Hey, anybody here
drive a blue convertible?

40:21.520 --> 40:22.920
Uh, I do. Why?

40:22.921 --> 40:24.091
It's being towed.

40:24.092 --> 40:26.924
Aw, come on.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.095
(Scoffs) (Dings)

40:28.096 --> 40:30.898
Uh, wait. Hold up, Charlie.

40:30.899 --> 40:33.060
I'll give you a ride
to the impound.

40:33.061 --> 40:34.431
(Stafford) Oh.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.703
(Clicks button)

40:35.704 --> 40:38.435
I'll buy you dinner.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.937
Okay. It's a deal.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.939
(Ding)

40:41.940 --> 40:44.642
Hmm. That didn't work out
quite the way you planned,

40:44.643 --> 40:45.843
did it?

40:45.844 --> 40:47.515
No.

40:47.516 --> 40:49.617
(Indistinct conversations)

40:49.618 --> 40:51.078
It hasn't.

40:51.079 --> 40:52.980
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

40:52.981 --> 40:54.552
(Elevator bell dings)

40:54.553 --> 40:57.556
(Indistinct conversations)

40:59.688 --> 41:01.889
Hey.

41:01.890 --> 41:04.161
That was some
fancy shooting earlier.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.733
Oh, thanks.

41:05.734 --> 41:07.234
Deep down, you're
probably wondering

41:07.235 --> 41:09.697
what would've happened
if I'd missed, right?

41:09.698 --> 41:12.870
No, you don't strike me
as a guy who misses.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.543
You got a first
name, officer Dunn?

41:15.544 --> 41:18.576
Riley.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.748
You like hockey?

41:20.749 --> 41:22.810
Sure. Who doesn't?

41:22.811 --> 41:26.113
'Cause I got two tickets
to a flyers game Friday.

41:26.114 --> 41:29.186
I don't know if
you're interested...

41:29.187 --> 41:31.118
I'd love to. (Chuckles)

41:31.119 --> 41:33.121
(Indistinct
conversations continue)
