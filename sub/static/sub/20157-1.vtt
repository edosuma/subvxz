WEBVTT

00:18.819 --> 00:21.689
(foreboding music)

00:56.924 --> 01:00.161
(car engine revving)

01:05.065 --> 01:07.268
(phone ringing)

01:07.301 --> 01:09.670
- Yeah?
- How it'd go?

01:09.703 --> 01:13.073
- It was a regular
party. What do you think?

01:13.107 --> 01:17.111
- Well did you get 'em?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.946
What do you have for me?

01:18.979 --> 01:22.082
Did you see her?
- It's not worth it.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.488
- He was there.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.801
Did you see inside?

01:42.035 --> 01:45.339
- Think about Boyd.
- Did you see inside?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.542
Jim!
- Everything.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.216
- I'll handle this.
- Roman?

02:41.895 --> 02:44.798
(foreboding music)

03:36.984 --> 03:38.319
- You made it.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.990
- That was the idea right?

03:48.095 --> 03:48.996
- You okay?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.334
- You tell me.

04:03.911 --> 04:08.449
- Showed you everything you
needed to make the score.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.721
- Who said anything went
wrong with the score?

04:14.922 --> 04:20.192
- Then what the fuck are we
having this conversation for?

04:20.226 --> 04:21.629
Let's split it up.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.634
- Is that what you
came here for, partner?

04:30.604 --> 04:33.441
Maybe you should take all of it.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.349
- You offering?
- No.

04:46.153 --> 04:49.923
But then, I didn't offer
you my wife either.

04:51.224 --> 04:55.496
- Easy partner, you and
Annabeth haven't been right

04:55.529 --> 04:59.066
for a long time.
- And that makes it okay?

05:00.334 --> 05:03.337
(ominous music)

05:07.675 --> 05:10.911
- No, I guess it don't.
- I guess not.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.618
(guns firing)
(foreboding music)

05:54.321 --> 05:59.059
(phone ringing)
- [Rod] Yeah?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.861
Boyd, hey your old man.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.370
- Hello?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.039
- I don't have much time.

06:12.072 --> 06:16.143
I'll meet you at the crossroads
where Route 108 dead-ends.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.080
I'll wait as long as I can.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.827
(groaning)

07:46.266 --> 07:47.067
- Fuck.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.346
Son of a bitch.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.906
- [Cop] Hey, what are
you doing out here?

10:11.144 --> 10:14.915
Put your hands on
top of your head.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.117
(mumbling)

10:34.467 --> 10:37.738
(anticipatory music)

11:43.937 --> 11:45.773
- You okay?
- Hmm-mm.

12:37.624 --> 12:41.161
I'm gonna take that out.
- When, next week?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.934
What's going on in there?

12:52.572 --> 12:53.373
- Nothing.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.547
- I gotta go to work.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.683
And you gotta go
out and find some.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.818
- I'm on it.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.654
- I don't wanna distract you.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.756
- Oh you don't wanna
do what you're doing?

13:09.789 --> 13:13.593
- Well, surprise me with
some good news later

13:13.626 --> 13:15.863
and maybe I'll surprise you.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.201
Don't forget to take
that garbage out.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.502
- I got it.

13:22.535 --> 13:26.339
- It's really starting to
smell in here, love you.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.540
- Love you too.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.021
- What do you say there?
- Hey.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.858
- Yeah I know.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.031
Here.
- No.

13:52.032 --> 13:55.102
- No I don't even wanna
hear about that, just,

13:55.135 --> 13:58.638
look, your lady is
working doubles as it is,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.407
what are you gonna do?

14:01.074 --> 14:03.643
- She just moved in.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.313
- Well, it's all about timing.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.615
You be careful there,
that's a woman that knows

14:08.648 --> 14:12.085
what she wants.
- Is that a good thing?

14:12.119 --> 14:14.888
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

14:17.624 --> 14:18.425
- Well...

14:22.195 --> 14:22.996
Ah...

14:24.764 --> 14:25.966
- What?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.972
- Mallick got an early parole.

14:34.774 --> 14:35.976
- When?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.845
- Couple of days ago.
- How?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.514
- It's a drying tap,
everbody's hands are tied.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.783
Department of Corrections
can't afford to house

14:43.816 --> 14:45.885
these sons of bitches.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.889
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.428
Well he'll be back in
before you know it.

14:55.462 --> 14:59.566
You just take your lady
to a movie or something.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.241
- What about you Jim?

15:09.776 --> 15:13.113
When are you gonna
find another woman.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.383
- Well let's just say
that I'm at a point

15:16.416 --> 15:20.287
where I'm not looking
for any new adventures.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.458
- Here, give me two.
- That's the magic number.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.226
Have fun.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.464
- Get on the ground now!

15:32.899 --> 15:36.036
- You fucking dick,
that's not funny.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.071
Hey, so I finally hooked
up with that Venezuelan

15:38.105 --> 15:39.572
chick last night.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.641
- Good for you.
- Yes it was.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.777
- You're beaming, are
you gonna marry her?

15:44.811 --> 15:46.813
- Once was enough
for me, thank you.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.115
- Don't be so cynical.

15:48.148 --> 15:48.982
- I'm not being cynical,
I just don't like dealing

15:49.016 --> 15:50.417
with lawyers.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.053
- I know you don't like
dealing with the law, period.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.954
- Get married and you'll see.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.489
- Hey, can't you
be happy for me?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.225
- I'd be a lot happier for
you if Sloan wasn't such a--

15:58.258 --> 16:00.260
- Don't say it.
- Sorry.

16:03.296 --> 16:08.601
So where is it, there we go,
you need a navigation thing?

16:08.635 --> 16:09.436
- No.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.172
Where did things
go wrong for you?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.541
- Survival is a skill Boyd.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.377
- I do need something
else though.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.612
- [Russell] I'll get
you whatever you want.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.980
- I need a gun.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.918
- And what for?

16:25.952 --> 16:28.821
- I'm sharpening
my survival skills.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.991
- Yeah, all right,
what kind do you want?

16:32.025 --> 16:35.495
- I don't care, just get
it fast, and don't mention

16:35.528 --> 16:37.164
this to Sloan.

16:37.197 --> 16:41.868
- Fine now get outta here
I got business, split.

16:41.901 --> 16:45.538
Hey, how are ya man?
- How are you man?

16:45.572 --> 16:46.739
- How you been?

17:30.016 --> 17:32.051
Relax, relax.
- Fuck.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.087
- It's empty.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.426
How many times I gotta tell
you to deadbolt that door?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.193
- Yeah.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.595
- Here it is.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.768
- Nice.
- Hmm-mm.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.483
- How much?

18:03.516 --> 18:07.787
- For that exceptional piece
of craftsmanship, three bills.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.659
- Three?
- Don't give me this shit man.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.231
- You couldn't find one cheaper?

18:18.265 --> 18:21.534
- [Russell] This
usually goes for 400.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.574
- I don't have it.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.243
- Then what the hell are you
asking me to get you something

18:30.277 --> 18:31.778
you can't afford?

18:32.879 --> 18:33.680
- Hang on.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.675
Help yourself.

19:03.776 --> 19:08.815
- Yeah, be careful with
this thing it's loaded now.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.749
What's this?

19:10.817 --> 19:14.687
- This, is a very rare
Russian wristwatch.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.492
Only a hundred made.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.395
- So it's precious, why
are you showing it to me?

19:22.429 --> 19:24.697
- It's yours, for the gun.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.268
- Give me my shit back.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.939
What do you want this gun for?

19:39.779 --> 19:44.417
You're not gonna do
anything stupid are you?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.619
- That's your department.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.393
- Was this your father's?

19:59.165 --> 20:02.201
Keep it, and you
pay me when you can.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.670
- I will.
- Yeah.

20:05.272 --> 20:09.008
Why don't go out and get
some sun you look like shit.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.678
And your place is
a fucking mess.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.264
- It's like weight pressed
against your chest,

20:31.298 --> 20:33.400
you can't breathe right.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.603
That desperation.

20:40.172 --> 20:44.110
When you know you've
lost something,

20:44.143 --> 20:45.845
money, a woman, time.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.351
A parent or two.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.256
It's good to see you Boyd.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.504
I wanted to offer
my condolences.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.808
I was sorry to hear
about your mother.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.244
Personally, I don't
think your father was

21:18.277 --> 21:21.614
worth offing herself
over, no disrespect.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.286
She always was a
little emotional.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.423
That creates conflict.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.292
Gets you into trouble.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.066
- What gets you into
trouble, murder?

21:45.438 --> 21:47.239
- That night your dad died--

21:47.273 --> 21:49.509
- That night you killed him.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.613
I know what happened.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.616
- Well good, then you can
tell me what you talked about

21:56.649 --> 21:59.886
in that last conversation
you both had.

21:59.919 --> 22:03.255
He'd tell you about
something he had of mine?

22:03.289 --> 22:05.892
- I never said I spoke to him.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.668
- Yeah if you
can't bluff, don't.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.908
What did you do with 'em?

22:21.941 --> 22:25.077
You find a way to sell 'em
or you hide 'em somewhere?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.213
- Why don't you tell me what
it is you think my dad--

22:27.246 --> 22:31.250
(groaning)
(scuffling)

22:31.283 --> 22:33.453
- What did he say to you?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.660
You ready to use that?

22:41.461 --> 22:43.530
- [Boyd] Don't move it.

22:46.065 --> 22:50.403
- That's a pretty woman you
got there Boyd, easy now.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.609
We're like family.
- Boyd!

23:05.251 --> 23:08.488
- [Mallick] You
should listen to her.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.502
- What's going on?

24:43.449 --> 24:46.385
(sad music)

24:46.418 --> 24:48.020
What do we do now?

24:49.756 --> 24:51.591
- I don't know he's
a fucking lunatic.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.492
- And you know for
a fact he did it?

24:53.526 --> 24:55.294
- Yes.
- How do you know?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.229
Maybe Jim owed somebody money.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.766
- He wasn't robbed, it was him.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.303
- All right, what do you
think your father had of his?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.605
- I don't know.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.239
- [Russell] Well if it's
important enough to him maybe

25:07.273 --> 25:08.507
he's willing to pay for it.

25:08.541 --> 25:11.510
- Just shut up Russell, what
are you here for anyway?

25:11.544 --> 25:13.512
- I'm here because Boyd
asked me to be here,

25:13.546 --> 25:15.247
and I've known him a hell
of lot longer than you have.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.050
- Yeah that's his problem,
you gave him a loaded gun

25:18.084 --> 25:19.518
for Christ's sake.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.190
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.058
- Well if it wasn't for that
gun, he might not be standing

25:26.092 --> 25:27.259
here right now.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.962
- You wanna end up dead over
this, just keep talking to him.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.631
- Sloan why don't you
head back to the diner

25:31.664 --> 25:33.399
and we'll call when we
got this all figured out.

25:33.432 --> 25:34.500
- At least I have a job.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.735
- I got jobs.

25:35.768 --> 25:39.305
- Yeah I've heard a lot
about your jobs, what?

25:45.077 --> 25:47.546
- I can't have you arguing
like this right now.

25:47.580 --> 25:51.317
- Then don't involve him
in this. It's our problem.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.352
- I have a plan.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.021
- Is he a part of it?

25:56.889 --> 25:57.690
- Yes.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.459
- Does it also involve that gun?

26:00.492 --> 26:01.193
- Yes.

26:02.729 --> 26:06.165
I need you to trust me, I
need you to trust me on this,

26:06.198 --> 26:07.166
okay, please.

26:18.878 --> 26:19.679
Thank you.

26:26.585 --> 26:27.954
- So what's the deal?

26:27.987 --> 26:29.388
- I wanna go out
and find this thing.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.257
- You know where it is?

26:33.660 --> 26:35.828
- I know where to start.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.935
(ominous music)

26:56.515 --> 26:58.184
Tired?
- Hmm, yeah.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.096
- It's gonna be okay, all right?

27:10.129 --> 27:10.863
- Yeah.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.974
- I'm all right, I'm okay.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.876
- Just focus on the road.
- I got it.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.445
- I got it, what do you need.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.782
- There's some buffalo
jerky in there.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.253
Yeah.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.224
A big piece.

27:41.694 --> 27:44.196
- Don't eat that.
- Close.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.633
- That was the prize inside.
- Hmm-mm, you don't want any?

27:47.666 --> 27:48.400
- No.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.715
(foreboding music)

28:22.434 --> 28:25.704
- That's a powerful one.
- Oh yeah?

28:25.738 --> 28:28.574
- [Storekeeper] For protection.

28:28.607 --> 28:31.710
- I could use some of that.
- I know.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.351
- Buying jewelry?

28:45.324 --> 28:48.194
(foreboding music)

29:06.345 --> 29:07.146
Thanks.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.813
So how much further you think?

29:44.283 --> 29:47.820
- 40 miles, yeah, uh-huh.
- 40, really?

30:09.075 --> 30:13.079
- [Mallick] Oh these
roads just wear you down.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.838
Yours too, huh?
- Yeah.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.549
- Do you mind?

30:55.187 --> 30:55.988
- No.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.857
- Thank you.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.733
- [Boyd] What's the matter?

31:07.766 --> 31:09.868
- Just some weird
dude in the bathroom.

31:09.902 --> 31:13.439
- Birds of a feather.
- A-ha...

31:13.472 --> 31:15.274
- Let's go.
- All right.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.626
Hey buffalo jerky.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.328
- Yep.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.767
- Nice, sweet and
spicy, nice choice.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.935
- Lord.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.009
- Were you checking behind you?

31:50.042 --> 31:52.244
- Ya, didn't see a thing.

31:55.647 --> 31:58.817
- This is where I was supposed
to meet him that night.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.153
- It's a dead end you know.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.597
What the fuck is that?

32:11.630 --> 32:13.832
- [Boyd] It's that thing I
was looking at in the store.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.535
- You bought it?
- I didn't buy it.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.137
- You stole it?
- No.

32:20.139 --> 32:23.309
- [Russell] Well then it looks
like you made a new friend.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.243
- I like it.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.947
- She likes it.
- Of course she does.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.051
All right so how do
you wanna do this?

32:32.084 --> 32:34.353
- [Boyd] Let's spread out.

33:29.908 --> 33:31.577
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:56.902 --> 33:57.703
Watch out.

34:17.688 --> 34:21.393
It's too dark out here, I
can't see a goddamn thing.

34:21.427 --> 34:26.632
- It's okay, let's just do it
first thing in the morning.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.301
- No, we'll be exposed
in the daylight.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.703
- No one's coming out here.

34:35.541 --> 34:39.110
- I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

34:42.813 --> 34:45.451
All right, let's go get Russell.

34:59.265 --> 35:03.135
(pig snorting)
- Oh oh what the fuck is that?

35:03.169 --> 35:04.670
- Russell?
- Yeah?

35:08.607 --> 35:12.311
- We're calling it a night.
- Why, we just got started.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.779
- Are you having too much fun?

35:13.812 --> 35:15.281
- Not as much fun as that
fucking pig that just

35:15.314 --> 35:17.616
scared the shit out of me.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.253
Oh do you hear that,
he's still out there.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.274
Yeah, let's call it a night.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.222
- You hungry?
- No.

35:59.057 --> 35:59.925
- You okay?

36:02.027 --> 36:04.162
- [Russell] I'll be a lot better
when we find whatever it is

36:04.196 --> 36:05.597
we're looking for.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.438
The hell are we looking for?

37:36.855 --> 37:39.558
- Good morning.
- Morning.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.260
- Find anything.
- Nope, thanks.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.333
Thanks.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.352
You guys ready?

38:06.385 --> 38:07.986
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.835
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh my God.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.309
- It's down there.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.348
I got a feeling.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.219
- [Sloan] That's over
a hundred foot drop.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.389
- [Russell] More than that.

38:44.255 --> 38:47.559
- There's no
guarantee it's there.

38:47.593 --> 38:48.326
- And?

38:50.762 --> 38:51.630
- Let's go.

38:55.266 --> 38:58.437
- You still glad you came?
- Are you?

40:26.958 --> 40:31.262
- You guys look over
there, I'ma head this way.

40:31.296 --> 40:34.500
Let's be back here in an hour.
- Okay.

41:29.788 --> 41:33.625
It's fucking hot out here.
- Like desert hot?

41:36.261 --> 41:38.496
Never gotten used to it.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.533
I don't know how you can
live without an ocean.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.702
- You can't miss
what you never had.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.671
- [Sloan] So profound.

41:46.738 --> 41:50.241
Are you looking?
- Yes, I'm looking.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.009
- Right.

41:52.544 --> 41:56.147
- The whole thing is
pretty out there though.

41:56.181 --> 41:59.785
- Jim laying there dead on the
floor was pretty out there.

41:59.818 --> 42:00.518
- Yeah...

42:03.121 --> 42:05.090
- What does he look like?

42:05.123 --> 42:06.858
- Dead.
- No, Mallick.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.030
- Serious?
- Now that's helpful.

42:12.063 --> 42:16.167
- I don't know, blue
eyes, deep voice.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.603
You never met him?

42:41.326 --> 42:44.029
- Well how the hell was I
supposed to know that was him?

42:44.062 --> 42:45.897
You know how many weirdos
hang out in those bathrooms?

42:45.931 --> 42:48.600
- No Russell, how many?
- A lot.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.903
- You should've said something.

42:51.937 --> 42:52.671
- Yeah...

42:55.741 --> 42:57.575
Hey, hey, over here.

43:00.712 --> 43:03.815
(foreboding music)

43:14.192 --> 43:15.994
- Hah, that's disappointing.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.529
- Yeah, what do you
think, think he made it?

43:18.563 --> 43:19.698
- Oh Christ get--

43:19.731 --> 43:21.399
(screaming)
- Oh are you okay?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.334
- Oh, we should get back.

43:23.368 --> 43:24.102
- Yeah.

43:32.577 --> 43:34.880
- [Sloan] Are you okay babe?

43:39.584 --> 43:41.252
- What's going on?

43:47.225 --> 43:49.027
What the hell is this?

43:53.264 --> 43:54.966
Son of a bitch!

43:55.000 --> 43:56.601
- [Sloan] I don't believe it!

43:56.634 --> 43:58.737
- [Russell] Where the hell
did your father get these?

43:58.770 --> 44:00.071
- I'm trying to figure that out.

44:00.105 --> 44:01.639
- Fuck having to
find a new job man,

44:01.673 --> 44:04.743
that's gotta be 400
grand right there.

44:05.744 --> 44:06.912
- Souvenirs?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.015
My dad died over this.

44:10.048 --> 44:11.582
- Well yeah you got 'em
now, he wanted you to have

44:11.616 --> 44:12.784
them damn it.

44:14.820 --> 44:17.989
- Have you forgotten
why we're here?

44:21.526 --> 44:22.327
- No.

44:23.962 --> 44:26.965
- So you're gonna
give 'em to him?

44:29.835 --> 44:32.704
- He'd have to kill me first.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.208
- Russell saw him at the
rest stop last night.

44:37.242 --> 44:39.544
- I thought he was just some
fucking weirdo in a bathroom.

44:39.577 --> 44:42.213
- Never mind, 400,000?
- At least.

44:44.916 --> 44:49.287
And I know a guy who
can fence 'em for us.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.055
- Sloan?

44:54.525 --> 44:55.894
We split it three-ways.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.263
- Oh hey I love three ways.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.636
- [Boyd] I thought you said
nobody followed us out here.

45:38.669 --> 45:41.472
- Nobody did follow us out here.

45:41.506 --> 45:44.675
- Yeah, how do you explain that?

45:44.709 --> 45:46.244
- I can't.
- Guys!

45:53.718 --> 45:55.253
- Be cool.
- Hmm-mm.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.705
- [Sheriff] What's
going on here?

46:14.739 --> 46:17.843
- We went for a
hike and somebody...

46:27.385 --> 46:31.923
- Hell, kids around here don't
have much else better to do.

46:41.199 --> 46:44.635
Mechanic shop next town over,
I'll give you guys a lift,

46:44.669 --> 46:48.206
and I can set you up
with some new tires.

46:55.813 --> 46:56.814
- Great.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.819
(ominous music)

47:58.209 --> 48:02.480
- [Sheriff] Are you looking
for something back there?

48:05.216 --> 48:06.017
- No.

48:11.389 --> 48:14.559
- Where y'all from?
- Near Westbrook.

48:16.694 --> 48:21.232
- [Sheriff] Westbrook, what the
hell you doing way out here?

48:22.833 --> 48:25.870
- Just a little outdoor hike.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.338
- [Sheriff] That spot's
not really known for

48:27.372 --> 48:32.243
its hiking, especially with
them dangerous footings.

48:32.277 --> 48:36.147
Y'all some sort
of thrill-seekers?

48:36.181 --> 48:36.982
- Sorry?

48:38.883 --> 48:42.920
- [Sheriff] Extreme
activities and what have you.

48:42.954 --> 48:46.857
- [Sloan] Well we just
like the outdoors.

48:46.891 --> 48:48.593
- [Sheriff] A-ha...

48:57.802 --> 48:58.970
Here you go.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.616
- Well we're not
buying eight new tires

49:11.649 --> 49:13.184
and going back out there.

49:13.218 --> 49:14.652
- We're just gonna
leave the cars?

49:14.685 --> 49:20.125
- When we cash in on those
rocks we can all buy new ones.

49:20.158 --> 49:23.228
- Yeah, we can't
go back out there.

49:25.130 --> 49:29.100
- Let's get some water
and figure this out.

50:08.906 --> 50:10.841
- [Janet] Next!

50:10.875 --> 50:12.009
Sir, next!

50:19.184 --> 50:23.521
- Where are the waters?
- Closed, where did you go?

50:25.323 --> 50:28.893
- I mailed them to your house.

50:28.926 --> 50:32.097
- What, why the fuck
would you do that?

50:33.431 --> 50:34.965
Why the fuck would you do that?

50:34.999 --> 50:36.501
- [Boyd] He was tailing
us on the ride over here.

50:36.534 --> 50:39.570
- Don't fuck with me, you
definitely saw Mallick?

50:39.604 --> 50:42.573
- It was just for a
moment, but yeah I saw him.

50:42.607 --> 50:44.875
- What does that mean
just for a moment?

50:44.909 --> 50:46.010
- He was there, and
then he was gone.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.278
- Oh you're tripping out man!

50:47.312 --> 50:51.449
- I don't know, we
can't take any chances.

50:51.482 --> 50:53.684
- You just put the
diamonds in the mail.

50:53.718 --> 50:55.220
- Yeah, yeah I did.

50:59.857 --> 51:02.193
- Where the fuck are we?

51:04.762 --> 51:06.564
- I don't know.
- Hey!

51:13.271 --> 51:17.007
- I can get you
about 45 minutes out.

51:17.041 --> 51:18.343
You should be able
to hitch a ride

51:18.376 --> 51:20.578
or catch a bus from there.

51:20.611 --> 51:23.314
- Thanks, we really
appreciate this.

51:23.348 --> 51:26.651
- Oh glad to help, I've been
broken down in the desert

51:26.684 --> 51:31.088
quite a few times myself,
the last one wife and I

51:31.122 --> 51:33.858
had it out for
nearly three hours.

51:33.891 --> 51:38.763
You know that old saying, "Hell
hath no fury like a woman.".

51:38.796 --> 51:41.199
- Like a woman scorned, Clint.

51:43.268 --> 51:46.704
- She's a real keeper,
smart ain't she.

52:06.891 --> 52:09.194
(gun fires)

52:16.100 --> 52:19.170
(ominous music)

52:33.017 --> 52:35.520
- The fucking diamonds,
hand them over.

52:35.553 --> 52:37.788
(gun fires)

52:39.790 --> 52:42.960
Don't make the same
mistake your old man made.

52:42.993 --> 52:43.728
- Don't!

52:49.967 --> 52:51.536
- Be ready to move.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.209
- Got here just in time.

52:59.344 --> 53:01.212
- What the hell's going on?

53:01.246 --> 53:02.580
- Injured folk in there.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.849
(gun fires)

53:09.454 --> 53:13.791
(engine revving)
(gun fires)

53:25.736 --> 53:27.438
- You should've let
me shoot that bastard.

53:27.472 --> 53:28.639
- He would've killed you.

53:28.673 --> 53:31.242
- I don't need
you to protect me.

54:14.819 --> 54:17.021
- Hey, yeah, we gotta talk.

54:20.958 --> 54:21.759
- Here.

54:24.995 --> 54:26.964
I'm sorry about earlier.

54:27.898 --> 54:28.699
- So am I.

54:32.870 --> 54:35.205
- What's that?
- Nothing.

54:35.239 --> 54:36.240
- Who are you on the phone with?

54:36.273 --> 54:37.608
- [Sloan] No one.

54:39.009 --> 54:40.345
- [Boyd] Let me see it.

54:40.378 --> 54:42.613
- I was gonna call
the police all right?

54:42.647 --> 54:45.650
- No, no that's not all right.

54:45.683 --> 54:46.717
Are you crazy?

54:46.751 --> 54:48.218
- Two people were
murdered back there

54:48.252 --> 54:50.355
and one of them was a sheriff,
this is out of control!

54:50.388 --> 54:51.689
- [Boyd] All right, and
having the cops on our asses

54:51.722 --> 54:53.724
is not gonna make this
any better, all right.

54:53.758 --> 54:57.127
- [Russell] You know what, yeah
okay, I'll talk to you then.

54:57.161 --> 54:58.596
- Who are you on the phone with?

54:58.629 --> 55:00.565
- Relax it's Alvarez.
- Who the fuck is Alvarez?

55:00.598 --> 55:01.532
- The guy who's
taking the merchandise

55:01.566 --> 55:03.501
off our hands tomorrow.

55:03.534 --> 55:06.170
- [Boyd] Okay listen, no
more phone calls all right?

55:06.203 --> 55:09.073
- We should get going.
- Yeah let's go.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.406
Well, we made it.

55:45.009 --> 55:49.346
- Our cars are out there,
along with two dead bodies.

55:51.048 --> 55:52.783
- You got a passport?

55:54.852 --> 55:55.753
You?
- Yeah.

56:00.491 --> 56:02.026
- You trust this Alvarez guy?

56:02.059 --> 56:06.130
- No, but I won't let these
go for less than 400,000.

56:07.965 --> 56:10.367
- [Sloan] These diamonds
were worth 500,000 dollars,

56:10.401 --> 56:12.069
seven years ago.

56:12.102 --> 56:13.538
- Armed gunman escapes with

56:13.571 --> 56:16.507
500,000 dollars
worth of diamonds.

56:17.608 --> 56:19.577
Your dad was the man.

56:19.610 --> 56:21.446
- How do you know
it wasn't Mallick?

56:21.479 --> 56:24.314
- It doesn't matter who it
was, clearly they're both

56:24.348 --> 56:28.152
in on it, they were
partners for Christ's sake.

56:30.621 --> 56:34.992
- Yeah, all right well we're
gonna make a little more,

56:35.025 --> 56:37.194
but we're still gonna take a
hit, it's a fast street sale,

56:37.227 --> 56:39.797
I say we go 600,000, 200 each.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.098
- That's it?

56:41.131 --> 56:42.533
- Well you wanna put these
up in an auction house,

56:42.567 --> 56:43.901
let's get real.

56:46.003 --> 56:46.804
So?

56:49.139 --> 56:50.841
Boyd.

56:50.875 --> 56:51.842
- Yeah?
- 600?

56:55.212 --> 56:56.013
- Yeah.

57:01.018 --> 57:04.789
- Hey, yeah we are good
to go for tomorrow.

57:12.362 --> 57:14.732
- You okay with this?

57:14.765 --> 57:17.201
- You okay leaving for good?

57:18.268 --> 57:20.137
- Whatever we gotta do.

57:23.774 --> 57:27.344
You didn't think he
bought 'em did you?

57:27.377 --> 57:30.447
- I knew they were
into some crooked shit,

57:30.481 --> 57:32.149
but nothing like this.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.853
They'd go away for a few
days, my dad would come back

57:35.886 --> 57:40.157
with some money, I didn't
ask, my mom didn't ask either.

57:42.860 --> 57:44.061
- But you knew.

57:46.597 --> 57:48.032
- Yeah, I knew.

57:51.636 --> 57:56.106
I loved him anyway, maybe
that sounds stupid to you.

57:56.140 --> 57:58.709
- No, I wish I could've met him.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.045
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.051
- All set.

58:09.053 --> 58:12.322
What the hell's the
matter with you two.

58:12.356 --> 58:14.258
- Just thinking
about the old man.

58:14.291 --> 58:15.025
- Ah.

58:18.428 --> 58:20.230
Here's to the old man.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.540
(door knocking)

58:33.077 --> 58:35.946
(doorbell ringing)

58:40.450 --> 58:41.652
- Okay.

58:49.259 --> 58:50.060
- Hey.

59:33.437 --> 59:36.073
(phone buzzing)

59:39.076 --> 59:40.577
He's on his way.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:03.300
(door knocking)

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.068
He's here.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.709
(chattering)

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.488
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, wasn't it?

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:26.657
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:28.258
Hey this is Boyd.

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:43.373
- This is big time
for you muchacho.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.692
Where did you get these?

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:05.095
- Inheritance.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:14.404
- Good looking.

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.825
Okay, 375.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:38.662
- They're worth six!

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.197
- You're the not the only
one who has to make money

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.165
off of this.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:45.202
- Well.
- We'll let 'em go for 550.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:53.543
- [Alvarez] Sorry we couldn't
make a deal, maybe next time?

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:54.711
- All right hang
on, why do I feel--

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:55.479
- No, no.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:58.115
550 or walk.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.459
It's what their worth.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:14.398
- But just a minute ago
they were worth 600.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.500
Do you see how that works?

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.803
This is not your thing man
you don't tell me what to pay

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.838
do you understand that?

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:22.506
- Fuck this.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.310
At least the other
guy's offering 450.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:31.148
- [Alvarez] You got an offer
for 450, that's bullshit.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:32.416
- Waste of time.

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:38.755
- Six large? You
high-balling motherfucker.

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.534
500, or you're wasting my time.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:56.874
- That works for me.

01:02:58.575 --> 01:02:59.776
- Okay.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.148
- Wait a minute.

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:09.386
(speaking foreign language)

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:21.798
- What was that?

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:24.668
- What you think I'm
gonna come over here with

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:27.471
half a million dollars?

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:29.539
- Then where is it?

01:03:29.573 --> 01:03:30.307
- Octavio.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.677
- [Russell] That wasn't
part of the deal.

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:37.014
- That is the deal if
you want the money.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:39.783
- Who's Octavio?

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.786
- Later, how long you
been working for him?

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.222
- He's a little more
relaxed now huh?

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:47.357
Hey I can take the
diamonds to him myself,

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.026
come back with your
money in a few hours.

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.528
- No fucking way.
- Boyd easy.

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:52.897
- Yeah easy Boyd.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.569
- Deals don't end
well with this guy.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.271
- Then we don't do it.

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.241
This doesn't sound good.

01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:07.011
- No, we do it.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:13.850
- All right enough
fucking around huh?

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:17.854
(speaking foreign language)

01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:21.625
- No, you're stay here.

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:22.726
- The hell I am.

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:24.028
- He's right you shouldn't go.

01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:24.861
- Oh really Russell--

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.497
(guns firing)

01:06:39.796 --> 01:06:41.865
- Sloan's gone.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:44.668
- [Russell] So is Mallick's car.

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:48.405
- She jumped out the window.

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:52.476
- [Russell] Well maybe
she didn't wanna get shot.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.511
- Then just drives away?

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:58.315
- Look man we got bigger
problems right now.

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:07.524
What?

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:22.572
(phone buzzing)

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.123
I'm sorry man.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.827
We still gotta finish this.

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:23.200
- Finish what?

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.370
- You can't lose it now.

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:31.006
I need you to recognize
the full situation here.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.910
- Full situation, it's fucked!

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.011
- Yeah it's fucked.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:40.116
But we gotta sell
these diamonds and go.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.486
- I'm gonna find her.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:45.788
- What you do after
this is up to you.

01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:50.960
Let's put Alvarez inside.

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:53.263
- Are you sure about that?

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:58.435
- We ain't never
coming back here.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.346
They're gonna be
expecting Alvarez.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.081
- [Boyd] How do we handle them?

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:14.751
- We're gonna tell
'em the truth.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.085
- No way.

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.854
- We don't have another
option, we gotta do this quick,

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:20.122
no haggling and get out, we
gotta be cool if we're gonna

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.058
do this.
- I'm cool.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.193
- All right.

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:01.465
He operates out that building.

01:10:02.332 --> 01:10:05.269
- You've been inside?
- Hell no.

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:17.481
In the back.

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:31.194
(door buzzing)

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.629
- [Octavio] Who are you?

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:35.832
- We're with Alvarez.
- Where's he at?

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:38.435
- Dead.

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.941
(door buzzing)

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:02.191
- [Octavio] What the fuck
you say about Alvarez?

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:03.693
- It's complicated.

01:11:05.529 --> 01:11:08.865
- Well un-fucking-complicate
it homie.

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:12.936
- Somebody else showed
up and tried to jack us.

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:14.571
Alvarez didn't make it, there's
Nothing we can do about it.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:18.174
- [Octavio] Where
is the someone?

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.876
- He's taken care of.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.316
- Couple a tough guys huh?

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.853
Quite a story hombre.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:33.923
Carlos, what do you think
of these fucking white boys.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:35.325
- I'm not sure.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:44.200
- What are you doing here.

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:46.302
- I wanna finish the deal.

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:51.441
- And you quiet one?

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.911
What's your fucking story.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:56.079
- They're mine.

01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:00.384
- Well where are they?

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:03.520
- Where's the money.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:07.857
- Carlos.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.737
Here you go gueros, now
show me what you got.

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:23.873
- It's 500,000?

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.943
- It's possible.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:51.501
Check this out homeboy,
these vatos are high rollers.

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:58.942
(speaking foreign language)

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:19.362
It's a shame about
Alvarez though.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:23.667
(guns firing)
(anticipatory music)

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:51.961
- [Russell] Keep driving.

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:07.343
- [Boyd] (mumbling),
we got both.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:10.046
- Just keep driving.
- We go both.

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:32.268
Are you all right?
- Don't worry about me.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.571
Just go get your passport.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:05.561
- Who shot him?

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:10.133
- Your father used you.

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:15.705
- I loved him anyway, maybe
that sounds stupid to you.

01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:19.042
Where are they?

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:29.352
- I didn't even want them.
- Then give them to me.

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:30.186
Please.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.624
Things got out of hand.

01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:13.663
(guns firing)

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.726
- Keys, keys, keys, keys!

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:47.030
(guns firing)
(car engine revving)

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:07.216
I think we're all clear.

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:14.924
Russell?

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:18.862
Russell?

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:22.398
- Yeah, we're clear.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:27.737
- Fuck.

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:37.213
Tell me how bad it is.

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:44.988
- Eyes on the road, don't
worry about us, we're fine.

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.850
- I'm sorry Boyd.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.229
- You fucked up Sloan.

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:30.299
- Yeah, I did.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.345
- You had me real good.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.413
We'll get you all patched up.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.155
We'll figure it out later.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:51.314
(ominous music)

01:22:30.746 --> 01:22:34.050
(foreboding music)

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:05.734
(upbeat music)
