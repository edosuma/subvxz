WEBVTT

00:43.478 --> 00:45.567
Who's that? He looks familiar.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.047
That is Armie Hammer.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.005
-He starred in <i>Lone Ranger.
-How old is he?</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:50.267
No, not the old one.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.095
This was a remake
just a few years ago.

00:52.139 --> 00:55.185
What was his issue?
Cannibalism, allegedly.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.144
Bite play, stuff like that.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.623
So how was he canceled?

00:58.667 --> 01:01.583
He got dropped from movies,
from the stage.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.411
-His agents dropped him.
-What are we talking about?

01:03.454 --> 01:05.195
-You're late.
-Sorry. I had paperwork.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.111
Well, you just have to listen
and catch up, won't you?

01:08.155 --> 01:09.547
God, are you in a bad mood?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.332
Nope, I just know you're
gonna disagree with me.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.204
Oh, no. Are you serious?
What?

01:14.248 --> 01:15.553
You're gonna clear these guys?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.555
No, they're-they're
not all just guys.

01:17.599 --> 01:18.643
Really? Where are the women?

01:18.687 --> 01:20.384
I got one right here.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.821
I spotted one...
Yep, Henrietta Michaels,

01:22.865 --> 01:25.302
former Professor
at Northwestern.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130
She was fired for using a word

01:27.174 --> 01:29.828
which was misunderstood
by her students.

01:29.872 --> 01:33.093
She wants
to defend herself on TV

01:33.136 --> 01:34.529
so she can get her job back.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.966
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That sounds like good TV.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.534
So four dozen guys accused
of rape and harassment,

01:39.577 --> 01:41.666
-and one woman.
-Oh, come on, Marissa.

01:41.710 --> 01:42.972
People are getting canceled
without a trial,

01:43.015 --> 01:44.408
no evidence
presented against them.

01:44.452 --> 01:45.496
-Because they did it.
-Maybe they did,

01:45.540 --> 01:46.671
maybe they didn't.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.151
or maybe it's more nuanced.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.414
Oh, my God, you sound
like that Canadian guy.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.937
The one who wrote
the book about that thing.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.548
If I knew what that meant,
maybe I'd be offended.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.245
You want to play
cancel-culture cop.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.508
No. I want to play judge.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.249
Oh, my God.
-Think about it.

01:59.293 --> 02:01.991
There are lots of reasons these
accusations never go to trial.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.298
The victims finally get to
accuse the victimizer

02:04.341 --> 02:05.864
face to face.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.866
-What if they don't want to?
-That's their choice.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.999
And the victimizer
gets the court to himself?

02:10.042 --> 02:12.044
To say whatever
bullshit he wants.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.481
This is a bad joke.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.047
-You're undercutting MeToo.
-No, no,

02:15.091 --> 02:17.615
-no, we're giving MeToo teeth.
That's right.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.357
If it relies on mob rule,
it'll exhaust itself.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.185
Okay. All right.
Mom, Dad, please.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.622
I hate when you fight.
Let's get back to work

02:24.666 --> 02:26.146
Who's up first?

02:26.189 --> 02:29.279
-Who's this guy?
-Oh, uh. Joey Battle.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.760
-Stand-up.
-Oh, God, you mean
Louis C.K. Two.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.065
-What'd he do?
He masturbated

02:33.109 --> 02:36.112
in front of two women
in a green room.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.027
To be fair, he did ask
for permission first.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.247
Seriously? If he did,
he didn't wait for a "yes."

02:40.290 --> 02:41.813
But he did not assault anyone.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.729
Oh. Are we really setting
the bar that low?

02:44.773 --> 02:46.340
Let's compromise.
We'll do both.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.734
-Both?
-Yeah, this guy
and, uh, Marissa's idea.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.084
The academic, uh,
Henrietta what's-her-name.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.174
Henrietta Michaels.
-That wasn't my idea.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.914
-When can we start?
You really think

02:55.958 --> 02:57.655
-there's time to do both?
We'll make the time.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.527
-Let's just schedule it.

02:59.570 --> 03:00.745
<i>That's my time, guys.</i>

03:00.789 --> 03:02.791
Thank you very much.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.884
June, you were great.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.582
The drinks are watered down,
so I know you're not drunk.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.236
No. You're funny.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.933
It's just this club sucks.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.109
Is this about Joey Battle?

03:17.153 --> 03:18.850
How'd you know?

03:18.894 --> 03:21.244
Reporters are the only ones
who approach me nowadays.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.811
I'm not a reporter.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.075
The last time I spoke out
about Joey Battle,

03:26.118 --> 03:27.381
this happened to me.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.426
I mean, I was on my way
to a serious career,

03:29.470 --> 03:31.036
and that scumbag derailed me.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.865
Not just off the tracks,
like buried under them.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.259
By testifying,
you'd get the truth out.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.695
Did you say "truth"?

03:37.739 --> 03:40.437
I thought we were talking
about a reality TV show.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.831
Millions of people could see it.

03:42.874 --> 03:45.094
I mean, I don't even know
the whole truth.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.531
When the story about Joey
was about to break,

03:47.575 --> 03:48.793
he reached out to me
on Facebook.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.360
And you know what he said?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.623
He said, "I'm sorry for shoving
you into a closet."

03:52.667 --> 03:54.016
He shoved you into a closet?

03:54.059 --> 03:56.148
No, with me, he just
jacked off into a plant.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.847
I can't help but think, though,
"who did he shove into a closet

03:58.890 --> 04:00.152
and what happened to her?"

04:00.196 --> 04:02.807
So you should
testify against him.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.027
-Bring that out.
-This is just another way
for Battle

04:05.070 --> 04:07.116
to get his career back.
I'm not participating in that.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.552
What if it wasn't?

04:08.596 --> 04:11.251
What if he was actually
confronted with his crime?

04:11.294 --> 04:12.469
It'll never happen.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.558
People like Battle win.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.212
People like me lose.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.171
But, you know what?
This is my consolation prize.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.043
His Wikipedia page.

04:21.086 --> 04:23.524
He's no longer
the comedian saint.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.614
Now he's Mr. Masturbater
in the greenroom.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.581
Who's defending Battle?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.888
The comedian?
David is.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.716
David Cord.
Why?

04:41.759 --> 04:43.326
He's a lawyer.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.937
My guess is he wants to
make an issue of cancel culture.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.200
Then I want to prosecute him.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.419
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.029
I'm gonna rip him a new one.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.467
-David or the comedian?
-Both.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.207
Oh, that's the spirit.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.732
What about the other case--
the, uh, academic lady?

04:57.775 --> 05:00.212
That's different.
She shouldn't have been fired.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.606
No, you want to prosecute one,
you have to prosecute the other.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.392
-Why?
-Because I'm unpredictable.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.436
Haven't you heard?

05:06.480 --> 05:08.264
It's about cancel culture.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.267
-Have to explore all sides.
-I don't want to explore
all sides.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.921
Well, this isn't about
what you want.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.749
Let's go into court.

05:15.576 --> 05:18.796
<i>Nobody move! Get down!
Get down on the ground!</i>

05:18.840 --> 05:21.408
<i>Get down!
This party is a violation</i>

05:21.451 --> 05:23.497
<i>of COVID quarantine rules!</i>

05:23.540 --> 05:24.933
<i>Turn that fucking music off!</i>

05:25.977 --> 05:27.631
Did you see that?

05:27.675 --> 05:29.894
<i>Is something funny here?</i>

05:29.938 --> 05:31.505
<i>What the hell's so funny?</i>

05:31.548 --> 05:33.985
<i>Nobody said anything.
-Come here!</i>

05:34.029 --> 05:36.727
Ms. Farrow, where
was this taken?

05:36.771 --> 05:38.250
At a friend's house party.

05:38.294 --> 05:41.123
It was a great day
until somebody called the cops.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.778
And the cop that
arrived was, uh,

05:43.821 --> 05:45.432
Officer McFinley, yes?

05:45.475 --> 05:47.390
Yes.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.087
<i>Get down. Get down over here!</i>

05:49.131 --> 05:51.742
<i>Ow! Hey, let me go.</i>

05:51.786 --> 05:54.049
<i>-I didn't do anything wrong!
-Get down!</i>

05:54.092 --> 05:56.225
<i>-Ow! Let me go.
-Get the fuck down!</i>

05:56.268 --> 05:58.183
<i>-Ow! Ow, you're hurting me.
-Stay down!</i>

05:58.227 --> 06:01.230
<i>-Ow!
-Get down! Stop resisting.</i>

06:01.273 --> 06:05.800
<i></i>

06:05.843 --> 06:07.236
<i>No...</i>

06:10.500 --> 06:11.936
What happened next?

06:13.285 --> 06:14.983
I ran to her.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.378
She wasn't breathing.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.816
When the paramedics arrived,

06:21.859 --> 06:23.383
she was dead.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.778
You know that Antoinette's
family is suing the Chicago PD

06:27.822 --> 06:29.214
for five million dollars?

06:29.258 --> 06:30.520
Yes.

06:30.564 --> 06:34.089
If it were up to me,
it'd be ten times that.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.575
Thank you, Miss Farrow.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.710
Miss Farrow, I'm-I'm so sorry

06:46.754 --> 06:49.017
for the loss of your friend.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.498
You were good friends,
weren't you?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.108
We were.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.458
So you knew she had a heart
condition? Tachycardia.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.547
-Can you tell us...
-Objection, Your Honor. That has

06:57.591 --> 06:59.419
-Objection. Under the eggsh...
-nothing to do
with what we're...

06:59.462 --> 07:01.899
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're
on the same side, you two.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.991
Your Honor, under the eggshell
doctrine, it is irrelevant

07:07.035 --> 07:08.645
whether Antoinette
had a heart condition.

07:08.689 --> 07:12.432
What does matter is that the
defendant caused the injury.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.346
Your Honor, we would argue
that the stun gun

07:14.390 --> 07:16.218
wasn't the true cause of death.
Her heart condition was.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.307
Okay, well, good for you two.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.396
You both got your statements
out to the jury.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.094
Overruled.
The defense may argue causation.

07:23.138 --> 07:25.183
-Please continue.
-Ms. Farrow,

07:25.227 --> 07:26.576
did Antoinette's heart condition

07:26.620 --> 07:29.187
mean she was supposed
to avoid overexertion?

07:29.231 --> 07:32.060
She had a heart arrhythmia,
but she was careful.

07:32.103 --> 07:35.542
That cop put 50,000 volts
through her.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.717
Right, that cop.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.327
Let's talk about that cop.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.677
Ms. Farrow, this is your
Instagram profile, isn't it?

07:40.721 --> 07:41.983
-Object-Obj...
-Objection.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.550
Okay.
Give me a hint, Counselors.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.421
-Relevance.
-This is inflammatory.
-Okay, okay.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.510
So, what is going on over there?
Do you need separate tables?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.599
-No, Your Honor.
-Just objection.
-You must know what's coming,

07:49.643 --> 07:52.123
because I don't.
Overruled.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.518
On Instagram, you quote
these rap lyrics,

07:55.562 --> 07:58.042
"Fuck the cops like porn stars,

07:58.086 --> 08:00.044
keeping us caged behind bars."

08:00.088 --> 08:01.655
Objection, Your Honor.

08:01.698 --> 08:02.873
It speaks to the witness' bias.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.222
To quote rap lyrics?
No.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.529
No. That shows
the counselor's racism.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.010
Oh, that's right, everything
you don't like is racist.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.360
The Supreme Court ruled
that rap lyrics can be

08:11.403 --> 08:14.058
-considered criminal evidence.
-No, they merely
declined to reverse.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.799
And you're going
one step further

08:15.843 --> 08:17.366
to damn someone
who quotes the lyrics.

08:17.409 --> 08:20.064
-I'm not damning.
-Okay, I'm-I'm gonna talk now.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.632
I don't like this like this line
of reasoning, Counselor.

08:22.676 --> 08:26.506
I have quoted Johnny Cash's song
about shooting a man in Reno.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.769
Does that go to my character?
I hope not.

08:28.812 --> 08:32.033
Sustained.
Let's move on.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.558
Professors expect students
to be respectful.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.299
I don't think
it's too much to expect

08:37.342 --> 08:39.997
that our teachers
be respectful in return.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.434
Okay, got it.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.045
And that irritated you?

08:44.088 --> 08:45.699
It more than irritated me.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.265
I-I found the word offensive.

08:47.309 --> 08:50.486
So you decided to call Professor
Henrietta Michaels out?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.749
Well, I just reported it.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.316
I mean, the word
is self-explanatory.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.188
-It's a triggering word.
-Here's the text of your tweet.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.103
Can you read it for His Honor?

08:59.147 --> 09:02.411
"How does Professor Michaels
think it's okay in 2021

09:02.454 --> 09:04.761
to use a word so similar
to the N-word?"

09:04.805 --> 09:07.372
So, at this point, I think we
need to talk about the word

09:07.416 --> 09:09.549
itself and how we're gonna
continue to refer to it.

09:09.592 --> 09:12.029
Our handy graphics team
at Copy Coop--

09:12.073 --> 09:14.858
20% off on all large orders
until Friday--

09:14.902 --> 09:17.557
has put the word on our display.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.820
That's the word.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.473
I feel like a little duck
should come down.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.866
"You say the magic word,
you collect a $100."

09:24.476 --> 09:26.870
Sorry, millennials,
you can look that one up.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.307
Anyway, from now on,

09:29.351 --> 09:33.398
I think we should refer
to the word as...

09:33.442 --> 09:35.226
um...

09:35.270 --> 09:36.880
I don't know.
Thoughts?

09:36.924 --> 09:39.056
N-word-ly?

09:39.100 --> 09:40.971
-Inelegant, but sure.
Uh, Your Honor,

09:41.015 --> 09:44.801
defense feels that
any euphemism for the word

09:44.845 --> 09:47.195
in question, uh,
biases the court against

09:47.238 --> 09:50.677
my client's honest use
of said word.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.593
"Said word?" Seriously?

09:53.636 --> 09:57.161
-It's powdered-wig time,
my friend.
-Oh, no. Your Honor, really?

09:57.205 --> 10:00.034
No obtuse use
of language or Latin.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.036
You know the penalty.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.299
Thank you, Dean.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.301
Very becoming.
Since I am

10:06.344 --> 10:09.043
the court, I will swear to you,

10:09.086 --> 10:11.175
I will not be biased
by said word.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.700
"N-word-ly" it is.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.484
Go ahead, Prosecutor.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.965
And you found
her use of that word--

10:18.008 --> 10:21.664
-notice I didn't say
"said word."
-Always in awe, Counselor.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.883
You found it offensive?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.798
Yes.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.887
Good.
I think that's it.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.366
No more questions.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.673
<i>-De lege lata.</i> That was a joke.
-I don't care.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.283
-That's why we have two. Dean.
-No, no, no,

10:32.327 --> 10:35.069
-that was a joke, I... No.
-Come on, Marissa.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.201
Now, Camille,
you are aware the word--

10:37.245 --> 10:38.855
-what is it?
-N-word-ly.

10:38.899 --> 10:42.380
N-word-ly-- you are aware
that it simply means "stingy"?

10:42.424 --> 10:44.034
-Right?
Yes.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.862
And that it comes from
an Old Norse word,

10:45.906 --> 10:47.951
"nigla," meaning "poor"

10:47.995 --> 10:52.173
-and it has the same root
as the word "niggle"?
-Yes.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.915
So, if Professor Michaels
had said the word "niggle"

10:54.958 --> 10:57.395
-would you have felt offended?
-No.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.484
-Why not?
-It wouldn't sound like

10:59.528 --> 11:01.704
-the "N-word."
-So it doesn't matter

11:01.748 --> 11:03.445
that the word in question

11:03.488 --> 11:05.577
has no racial connotations
whatsoever?

11:05.621 --> 11:07.884
Given how it sounds,
the word definitely

11:07.928 --> 11:09.494
has racial connotations,

11:09.538 --> 11:11.105
whether you're prepared
to acknowledge that or not.

11:11.148 --> 11:14.195
But the etymology
of the word is non-racial.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.371
I'm not an expert in etymology,

11:16.414 --> 11:19.722
but I do know something about
people using the N-word.

11:20.854 --> 11:24.509
Camille, before you tweeted
about Professor Michaels'

11:24.553 --> 11:26.598
use of N-word-ly,

11:26.642 --> 11:29.253
wasn't there something else
she did that upset you?

11:29.297 --> 11:32.256
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.
Well, you asked her twice

11:32.300 --> 11:34.302
for an extension
on your term paper.

11:37.784 --> 11:38.915
Yeah-huh.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.264
And she said no.

11:40.308 --> 11:43.485
And when you did
turn in the term paper late

11:43.528 --> 11:46.227
anyway, what grade did you get?

11:46.270 --> 11:47.750
-She gave me a C.
And isn't that

11:47.794 --> 11:50.884
really the reason that
you wanted to get her fired?

11:50.927 --> 11:52.276
No.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.756
Can't you object or something?

11:53.800 --> 11:56.716
-This has nothing to do with it.
-Even if she did object,

11:56.759 --> 11:58.195
you'd still have to
answer the question.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.762
This court is bullshit.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.243
You want to clear her
so she can get her job back,

12:02.286 --> 12:04.201
but she knew what she was doing
using that word.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.508
-No, I didn't.
-Come on.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.206
You think college is meant
to be a warm, cuddly place

12:09.250 --> 12:10.730
-where you're not challenged.
-No,

12:10.773 --> 12:13.558
I just don't want to spend
my day being offended.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.778
These are the words that
make up the English language.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.519
They exist.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.869
They don't mean
what you think they mean.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.784
-And that is education.
-No.

12:21.828 --> 12:25.788
An education is living in now,
not in the 16th century.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.486
Okay, good. That was
illuminating.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.706
You can step down now.
Thank you, my dear.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.670
Fuck you.
You're not even trying.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.116
The optics matter.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.813
Racially.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.163
I agree.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.949
Some of the jurors
may react to a woman

12:55.992 --> 12:58.212
interrogating a man, period.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.214
Well, we're both women.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.781
That... that can't be helped.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.522
Some of the jurors
may feel more comfortable

13:04.566 --> 13:06.002
if, um...

13:06.046 --> 13:08.265
if I question the cop.

13:09.745 --> 13:10.833
'Cause you're white?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.749
Yes.
I'm just speaking pragmatically.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.665
They may not think I have
as big a dog in the fight.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.625
And, on the other hand,
some jurors might appreciate

13:20.669 --> 13:23.280
that I <i>do</i> have
a dog in the fight.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.066
Okay. Well, I could
be more dispassionate.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.198
Do we want dispassionate?

13:30.940 --> 13:34.465
Liz, you're shoving me out
of my name partner position

13:34.509 --> 13:36.903
-because of my race.
-I am doing nothing.

13:36.946 --> 13:40.080
You are the one
who got our racist clients

13:40.123 --> 13:41.559
to whine to STR Laurie about us.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.300
Those clients bring in
a great deal of money,

13:43.344 --> 13:44.388
and they are not racists.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.303
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

13:46.347 --> 13:47.827
They have been my clients
for 15 years.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.263
That's what it was about.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.091
Are you saying that-that
if you were being replaced

13:51.134 --> 13:53.571
by another white partner they
would have the same objection?

13:53.615 --> 13:56.226
I'm saying... maybe they
worry about racial grudges.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.359
-Oh, my God.
-I mean, what do you call

13:58.402 --> 14:00.535
pushing me out of a-a...
of a name partnership

14:00.578 --> 14:03.799
-that I worked for?
-That you felt entitled to.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.670
Excuse me?

14:05.714 --> 14:06.846
Really?

14:06.889 --> 14:07.977
That's what you think?

14:08.021 --> 14:09.718
Yeah.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.764
I think that Barbara Kolstad
was shoved out

14:12.808 --> 14:14.854
because you felt entitled
to her position.

14:15.724 --> 14:19.467
Fine. Let's finish this case,

14:19.510 --> 14:22.383
We can't work together
if you don't respect me.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.734
No, we can't work together
if you use race cynically.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.083
Oh, fine.

14:27.127 --> 14:30.043
You cross-examine him,
because this is bullshit.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.435
This is motherfucking bullshit.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.916
You want to come after me,
you come after me

14:33.960 --> 14:37.615
with an honest argument
about my lack of competence,

14:37.659 --> 14:40.401
-my lack of worth.
-Your unworthiness--

14:40.444 --> 14:42.925
which you don't seem
to want to acknowledge--

14:42.969 --> 14:46.842
is you can't be the top dog
in a Black firm.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.239
Wake up.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.942
Ever shoot anybody?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.291
No, ma'am.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.989
Not in 11 years of service.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.905
Other than on the occasion
of Antoinette Lacey's passing,

15:05.948 --> 15:07.297
had you ever used your stun gun?

15:07.341 --> 15:09.560
Never, and...

15:09.604 --> 15:11.693
I hope to God I never do again.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.651
Did anyone tell you

15:13.695 --> 15:15.523
that Antoinette Lacey
had a heart condition?

15:15.566 --> 15:19.135
No. No one did.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.181
I just...

15:30.190 --> 15:32.148
So, other than
killing an unarmed girl,

15:32.192 --> 15:34.977
Object to "killed."
-you never used your stun gun?

15:35.021 --> 15:37.458
-Yeah, Counselor, rephrase.
So, other than using

15:37.501 --> 15:39.764
lethal force on an unarmed girl,

15:39.808 --> 15:42.158
you only faced
disciplinary action

15:42.202 --> 15:43.638
for violent behavior once?

15:43.681 --> 15:45.248
I'm not sure
what you're referring to.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.947
In February, 2019,

15:47.990 --> 15:50.862
did Chicago PD
respond to a report

15:50.906 --> 15:52.560
of a domestic dispute
at your house?

15:52.603 --> 15:54.344
Objection.
Your Honor, Officer McFinley

15:54.388 --> 15:55.955
isn't on trial
for his personal life.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.392
No, he's on trial
for being a violent cop.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.524
Overruled.
The witness may answer.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.136
It wasn't...

16:03.179 --> 16:04.702
It was an argument.

16:04.746 --> 16:05.965
My wife...

16:06.008 --> 16:07.009
My ex-wife...

16:07.053 --> 16:08.706
We had a fight,

16:08.750 --> 16:10.404
not a physical one, verbal.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.276
-So it was
just a noise disturbance?
-Yes.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.887
-Your Honor...
-Uh, Your... Your Honor,

16:15.931 --> 16:18.020
we would like
to call our next witness,

16:18.064 --> 16:19.456
Officer McFinley's ex-wife,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.849
-Vanessa McFinley.
Your Honor,

16:20.892 --> 16:22.590
Ms. McFinley was not
on the witness list.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.505
She doesn't need to be.
She's being used

16:24.548 --> 16:26.898
to rebut
Officer McFinley's testimony.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.205
-The testimony he just swore to.
-I'm sorry, just a moment,

16:29.249 --> 16:31.425
-Ms. McFinley.
Your Honor,
I know that

16:31.468 --> 16:32.904
with your politics you lean

16:32.948 --> 16:34.819
-to the worldview of BLM...
-No, no,

16:34.863 --> 16:36.473
Counselor, please
don't try that.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.649
Then we ask for a recess
to review with our client.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.216
They can review all they want.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.784
It's not gonna change
what's been said on the stand.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.004
Well, still, Ms. Reddick, um...

16:45.047 --> 16:47.528
let's adjourn
to tomorrow morning.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.315
Well, it was a good try
to get her in today.

16:52.359 --> 16:53.882
Yeah, well,
whether we get her in today

16:53.925 --> 16:57.320
or tomorrow, it doesn't matter.
She's a slam dunk.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.197
Nicholas Dupont.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.807
I represent comedians.

17:06.634 --> 17:09.332
I want to help anyone
who's serious about comedy

17:09.376 --> 17:10.638
and his career.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.946
-His career but not her career?
-I... Uh, no, that's-that's not

17:14.990 --> 17:16.948
-what I was trying to say.
-One for

17:16.992 --> 17:19.168
the prosecution, Dean.
No, no, wait.
Now, she didn't

17:19.212 --> 17:21.779
-let me finish my statement.
-Yes, she did, sir.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.739
And you revealed your mindset
with a spontaneous utterance.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.393
Continue, Madame Prosecutor.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.960
-Miss Prosecutor.
-Miss, my apologies.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.398
Your clients
include Joey Battle.
That's right.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.790
He's a very talented man.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.315
One of the funniest men alive.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.753
Did doing your best for Joey
mean silencing

17:38.796 --> 17:40.494
June Barrow
after he victimized her?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.365
Uh, objection to victimized.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.802
You only get three objections
per day in my court, Mr. Cord.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.195
You sure you want to use it now?

17:46.239 --> 17:47.544
Uh...

17:47.588 --> 17:49.285
Objection withdrawn.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.331
I never silenced anyone.

17:51.374 --> 17:55.552
I have here an affidavit from
Steve Brant at the Laugh Farm

17:55.596 --> 17:57.380
saying you explicitly told him

17:57.424 --> 17:59.252
to cancel June's
upcoming booking.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.384
Eh, he hates me.
Uh-huh. And you

18:01.428 --> 18:02.907
-apparently hate him.
-Look,

18:02.951 --> 18:04.648
I might have called her
a loose cannon.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.520
That's a possibilit...

18:06.563 --> 18:08.652
Look, uh...

18:08.696 --> 18:11.655
at the time, I had no idea
there was any truth

18:11.699 --> 18:13.570
-to the allegations about Joey.
-You didn't notice

18:13.614 --> 18:15.572
that June's story
had uncanny similarities

18:15.616 --> 18:17.922
to stories told
by other female comedians?

18:17.966 --> 18:20.099
I heard a rumor that Joey
might have had an affair or two

18:20.142 --> 18:21.665
that went sour, but...

18:21.709 --> 18:25.582
I-I didn't understand
the allegations, exactly.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.106
You never heard
that he had a habit

18:27.149 --> 18:29.064
of inviting women
to his dressing room,

18:29.108 --> 18:31.110
blocking the door,
and then masturbating

18:31.153 --> 18:33.416
-into a potted ficus?
-Absolutely not.

18:33.460 --> 18:36.158
So it's just a coincidence that
at your 2015 holiday party

18:36.202 --> 18:37.855
you made a joke
that people should keep Joey

18:37.899 --> 18:40.075
away from the Christmas tree?

18:43.644 --> 18:47.691
I think this deserves
two slashes, Dean.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.651
Marissa.

18:50.694 --> 18:53.001
Use me however you want.
I'm in.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.176
-Really?
-Yes.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.787
Oh!
Thank you.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.180
Hey.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.617
Where was that passion
in the N-word case?

19:01.749 --> 19:04.969
Oh, I guess I feel like
it's not the N-word.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.319
It is.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.451
It always is.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.484
<i>Witnesses heard the shooter
yell, "That's for Antoinette,"</i>

19:41.528 --> 19:44.226
<i>-an apparent reference
to the ongoing
-Oh, my God.</i>

19:44.270 --> 19:45.836
<i>-civil suit against the officer.
-Diane, turn on the news.</i>

19:45.880 --> 19:47.534
<i>In what is turning into
a season of...</i>

19:49.405 --> 19:53.192
<i>Before two shots
were fired at close range.</i>

19:53.235 --> 19:55.150
<i>The assailant is unknown
and still at large.</i>

19:55.194 --> 19:57.587
<i>Many wonder whether
the ongoing brutality lawsuit</i>

19:57.631 --> 19:59.589
<i>against the city
had something to do with</i>

19:59.633 --> 20:02.113
<i>the patrol officer's murder.</i>

20:02.157 --> 20:03.941
Oh, fuck.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.944
<i>Jesse McFinley was a father
of four and a 15-year veteran</i>

20:06.988 --> 20:09.643
<i>of the Chicago
Police Department.</i>

21:55.096 --> 21:56.619
Do you guys have a minute?

21:56.663 --> 21:57.925
Sure.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.059
Remember how you told me
how much you hate

22:02.103 --> 22:03.409
being Blackopedia
for white people,

22:03.452 --> 22:04.975
explaining what is
or isn't offensive?

22:05.019 --> 22:06.586
Yeah.

22:06.629 --> 22:09.806
I really need to ask you if
something is or isn't offensive.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.723
We love playing this game
with white allies.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.377
You can ask me about Jews
any time you want.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.596
Just go.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.816
I'm prosecuting someone
in Wackner's court

22:19.860 --> 22:21.731
who lost their professorship
for saying a word.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.038
What word?

22:28.521 --> 22:29.652
Niggardly?

22:29.696 --> 22:30.784
As in "stingy"?

22:30.827 --> 22:32.960
Exactly. Is the word offensive?

22:33.003 --> 22:35.615
-No. It means stingy.
-Wait...

22:35.658 --> 22:36.920
It's a medieval word

22:36.964 --> 22:38.879
that no one uses
in casual conversation.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.403
-You really think
it's offensive?
-I think it's a microaggression.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.100
And microaggressions
are like Pringles.

22:43.144 --> 22:45.320
You never have just one.
If you mean "stingy"...

22:45.364 --> 22:47.148
But don't you undercut
the English language

22:47.191 --> 22:49.150
when you reduce the number
of words we can use?

22:49.193 --> 22:50.281
Then create new ones!

22:50.325 --> 22:51.587
That's how language develops.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.894
-Why not do both?
-Okay.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.287
-African Americans aren't
monolithic. I get it.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.072
-No, Carmen is just weird.
-No.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.988
I just don't have the same
thin skin that you do.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.859
-Really? Thin?
Uh-huh.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.905
Not a Black person on earth
would ever let that word slide.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.168
Thank you for supporting
the monolithic argument,

23:07.211 --> 23:09.388
but I think it has nothing
to do with that.

23:10.214 --> 23:13.479
Although I've asked you
to ignore the news,

23:13.522 --> 23:18.005
you've probably heard by now
that Officer McFinley

23:18.048 --> 23:20.442
-was killed last night.

23:20.486 --> 23:23.358
Our deepest sympathies
go out to his family.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.144
Nevertheless, uh,
this case is not against him,

23:27.188 --> 23:29.930
it is against the Chicago PD.

23:29.973 --> 23:34.021
We must do our best
to set aside emotions

23:34.064 --> 23:36.415
and look only at the facts.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.764
But first...

23:37.807 --> 23:40.114
a moment of silence

23:40.157 --> 23:43.465
feels appropriate.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.174
We're fucked.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.309
Thank you for answering
our questions, Ms. McFinley.

24:02.092 --> 24:05.182
Can you tell us about your
ex-husband's violence

24:05.226 --> 24:07.576
and the domestic abuse call?

24:08.751 --> 24:10.971
He was a good man.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.061
When he got stressed out,

24:14.104 --> 24:16.498
it was only 'cause he
was working too hard.

24:16.542 --> 24:20.328
He put his life on the line
every single day.

24:20.371 --> 24:23.113
But he-he, he did hit you?

24:23.157 --> 24:25.725
I'm so sorry, Jess.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.988
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.511
You didn't deserve it.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.913
Mr. McFinley's death,
in the middle of this case,

24:39.956 --> 24:41.741
has clearly prejudiced
this jury.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.003
Why would you think that?

24:43.046 --> 24:44.265
Oh, come on.

24:44.308 --> 24:45.745
Not a great argument, Counselor.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.703
I'm going to need something
more than "Come on."

24:47.747 --> 24:48.835
We're worried that the jury

24:48.878 --> 24:50.358
won't base their decision
on fact.

24:50.401 --> 24:51.925
They're gonna base it on
McFinley being violently killed.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.535
You were never basing this
on the facts.

24:53.579 --> 24:54.928
You were basing this
on the emotions

24:54.971 --> 24:56.233
for that poor Black girl.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.844
-Okay, thank you.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.715
I'm-I'm just gonna keep
talking until somebody listens.

24:59.759 --> 25:02.239
So, I'm just talking, talking.
Words, words, words.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.154
I'm calling a voir dire de novo.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.808
I know. I know.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.331
I've never done this before.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.072
A voir dire, mid-trial,

25:09.116 --> 25:10.987
you can re-question
the jury in chambers.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.902
You can ask them if they're
watching the news

25:12.946 --> 25:14.600
and find out
how they're impacted.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.298
And if they are impacted,
you will declare a mistrial?

25:17.341 --> 25:18.560
I don't know what I'll do.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.606
You can solve this, though.
You know?

25:20.649 --> 25:25.219
You three can come up with some
kind of negotiated settlement.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.263
That's my recommendation.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.570
But what do I know?

25:28.614 --> 25:32.052
Joey invited comedians
to his dressing room for drinks

25:32.095 --> 25:33.793
after shows sometimes.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.055
Hey, Joey.

25:35.098 --> 25:36.970
I was excited
when he invited me.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.233
I thought, finally,
I'm in the inner circle.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.931
I didn't realize
it would just be me and Joey.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.324
Can you tell us
what happened next?

25:43.367 --> 25:46.066
He asked if he could...

25:47.937 --> 25:49.504
jerk off in front of me.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.898
I thought it was a joke,
so I laughed.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.073
But then he did it.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.553
I just stood there.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.903
Like it was some kind
of an initiation.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.600
Did you tell anyone
what happened?

25:58.644 --> 25:59.601
I told everyone,

25:59.645 --> 26:02.038
and they all blamed me.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.562
The men especially.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.998
They just looked at me
like I compelled Joey

26:05.041 --> 26:06.347
to quick masturbate.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.741
My manager told me
to shut my mouth,

26:08.784 --> 26:10.438
-or it would ruin my career.
-And did it?

26:10.481 --> 26:13.310
The first gig I had
as a headliner got canceled.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.052
Things went south after that.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.141
Has your career ever rebounded?

26:18.185 --> 26:19.882
Fuck no. Hmm-mm.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.754
I'm sorry, June.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.104
Nothing further.

26:28.935 --> 26:30.458
Ms. Barrow,

26:30.501 --> 26:35.289
you had a headliner gig
canceled on July 11, 2019?

26:35.332 --> 26:37.639
-Is that right?
-Uh-huh.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.860
I'd like to read a review
from a prior gig on July 10th.

26:40.903 --> 26:44.385
"While June Barrow has been
described as a rising star,

26:44.428 --> 26:47.431
"she proved tonight
how easy it is to mistake

26:47.475 --> 26:49.433
a low-flying satellite
for a distant sun."

26:49.477 --> 26:51.653
Ms. Barrow, your headliner gig

26:51.697 --> 26:53.524
was canceled
because of bad reviews.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.352
-Wasn't it?
-Comics get bad reviews
all the time.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.745
Have you read Joey Battle's?

26:56.789 --> 26:58.617
Well, why don't you show us
your act then?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.053
Let the court see
just how funny you are.

27:00.096 --> 27:01.489
-Objection.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.273
That sounds like a good idea.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.492
It's irrelevant, Your Honor.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.450
This is the wrong venue,
the wrong crowd.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.322
You-You've gotten tons
of laughs in here.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.106
They were spontaneous.
This is different.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.674
Marissa, you're flailing.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.545
You know what you get
when you flail.

27:14.589 --> 27:15.982
I... Your Honor,
I am not flailing.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.810
Put it on, Marissa.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.594
Come on.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.685
Okay, be seated.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.470
Okay, let's hear it.
Tell us some jokes.

27:26.514 --> 27:29.386
-I'm not really a joke comedian.
-What other kind is there?

27:29.430 --> 27:32.694
I tell stories about the frailty
of being human.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.304
Oh, okay. Do that.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.220
Uh...

27:38.308 --> 27:40.789
Ah, okay, uh...

27:40.833 --> 27:44.706
Uh, who came up
with the term "rape fantasy"?

27:44.750 --> 27:48.362
I mean, what was that woman
thinking? She should aim higher.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.190
One day I'm gonna win
an Oscar and cure cancer,

27:50.233 --> 27:52.540
-and then...

27:52.583 --> 27:54.934
I love being a millennial.

27:54.977 --> 27:58.546
I can wake up late and blame
everyone else for everything.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.074
Okay, Dean.

28:08.469 --> 28:11.080
Have a seat in the,
uh, witness box,

28:11.124 --> 28:13.517
Juror Number Two.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.564
So, uh, the attorneys are
gonna ask you some questions

28:16.607 --> 28:19.306
about recent events to see
how you've been affected.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.829
Is that okay?

28:20.873 --> 28:24.485
You posted on Facebook
after the McFinley killing.

28:24.528 --> 28:25.747
-Didn't you?
-I guess.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.836
I talk to my grandkids
every day.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.229
Mm-hmm. You wrote,

28:29.272 --> 28:32.188
"People need to have respect
for what cops do.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.103
A hero was gunned down."

28:34.147 --> 28:35.757
I just think he deserves
a little respect.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.324
The man died.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.282
-Your Honor, we move
to strike for cause.
-Objection.

28:39.326 --> 28:40.762
This is all racial.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.678
It is not. She wrote
in support of McFinley.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.333
Yeah. Yeah, I'll give it to you.
Uh, juror dismissed.

28:46.376 --> 28:47.900
Let's get the next one in here.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.510
Thank you. Thank you.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.688
Didn't three Black students
approach you

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
about not repeating the word
"N-word-ly"?

28:55.777 --> 28:59.259
Oh, they objected to many
of the ways I taught.

28:59.302 --> 29:02.349
And, despite that,
you used the word again,

29:02.392 --> 29:04.351
even though you were told
it made them uncomfortable?

29:04.394 --> 29:06.788
Objection. Unduly argumentative.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.529
She didn't commit murder.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.445
True, but I love a good
Socratic argument. Go for it.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.403
You used "N-word-ly" again,
didn't you, Professor?

29:15.666 --> 29:18.408
I took it as a teaching moment.

29:18.452 --> 29:21.150
I-I explained
what the word meant,

29:21.194 --> 29:24.284
and, uh, I had to use the word
in order to explain it.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.328
Even though
you were asked to stop?

29:25.372 --> 29:26.765
I'm an educator.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.941
Challenging students
is my responsibility.

29:28.984 --> 29:30.377
So you're trying to offend?

29:30.420 --> 29:33.075
No, but I am trying to prepare
my students

29:33.119 --> 29:36.122
for a world that won't kowtow
to their sensitivities.

29:36.165 --> 29:39.778
So you deliberately say things
to trigger students?

29:39.821 --> 29:42.563
School is not a place
to be comforted.

29:42.606 --> 29:43.956
It's a place to be challenged.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.915
Where do you draw the line
between challenged

29:46.959 --> 29:48.177
and triggered?

29:48.221 --> 29:49.352
I don't.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.963
A-a-a class shouldn't be
governed

29:51.006 --> 29:52.878
by the most fragile sensibility,

29:52.921 --> 29:56.882
or, or it would shy away
from every difficult subject.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.928
A history class
has to discuss rape

29:59.972 --> 30:01.669
when talking about war crimes.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.584
But it doesn't have
to describe it in detail.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.674
It does if it wants
the students to sympathize,

30:06.717 --> 30:09.285
to understand
a victim's account.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.984
The only way to honor a victim

30:12.027 --> 30:14.638
might be to relate
to her full account.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.598
Okay, I get that.

30:17.641 --> 30:20.557
But why not use
the word "stingy"

30:20.601 --> 30:24.692
or "miserly"
instead of "N-word-ly"?

30:24.735 --> 30:27.608
Because I like clarity
in language.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.436
I like variety in language.

30:29.479 --> 30:33.527
And, and-and, yes,
maybe I am pushing back a bit.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.876
Then why not use the N-word?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.400
Could we have one questioner
at a time?

30:37.444 --> 30:38.967
No, answer the question.

30:39.011 --> 30:41.404
If you want to push back,
why not use the actual N-word?

30:42.231 --> 30:46.670
Because I'm not teaching the
Civil War or <i>Huckleberry Finn.</i>

30:46.714 --> 30:48.934
And if you were, you might?

30:50.761 --> 30:52.328
Yes.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.114
Juror 14.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.594
Identifies as mixed race.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.205
Works at a food bank.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.946
Probably won't be able
to knock him off.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.512
We're out of options.

31:02.556 --> 31:05.037
We need one more juror
bumped to get our mistrial.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.387
-I've checked. We don't
have anything else.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.476
You need to see this.

31:09.519 --> 31:10.912
Oh, good God. What now?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.218
We're on the news.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.046
On? What does that mean?

31:14.089 --> 31:16.396
<i>Systemic racism.
White privilege.</i>

31:16.439 --> 31:20.226
<i>We hear it from academics
and Hollywood celebrities</i>

31:20.269 --> 31:21.923
<i>and basketball players.</i>

31:21.967 --> 31:24.012
<i>By the way, how many houses
does LeBron James have?</i>

31:24.056 --> 31:27.581
<i>Now add to the list
Marxist slip-and-fall lawyers</i>

31:27.624 --> 31:29.931
-<i>from "Raddick"/
-Lockhart.</i>

31:29.975 --> 31:32.629
<i>You need to hear what one
of these lawyers had to say</i>

31:32.673 --> 31:34.631
about martyred Chicago
police officer

31:34.675 --> 31:36.590
Jesse Patrick McFinley.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.419
Cops have not been held
accountable for far too long,

31:39.462 --> 31:41.508
and now the bill is due.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.337
I made that statement
before McFinley was killed.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.774
A cop gunned down in cold blood.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.776
And to lawyer Diane Lockhart,

31:48.819 --> 31:51.387
-Oh... <i>
-"The bill's come due."</i>

31:51.431 --> 31:53.433
<i>Was that not her finger
on the trigger</i>

31:53.476 --> 31:57.089
as much as whatever thug
held the gun?

31:57.132 --> 31:58.612
<i>I'm asking the question</i>

31:58.655 --> 32:01.397
<i>because that's what we do here.</i>

32:03.443 --> 32:04.966
Maybe we could use this.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.275
With the judge?

32:09.318 --> 32:11.146
He hates Fox News.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.061
Maybe we could start over
again with the jurors.

32:13.105 --> 32:16.586
Well, I'm glad you find
something positive here.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.328
He just called you two
co-assassins.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.765
We need to get you security.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.167
So one more juror.

32:32.211 --> 32:34.126
And we have our mistrial.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.605
That's doable.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.395
Stay close.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.948
All rise.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.649
May we approach, Your Honor?

33:20.563 --> 33:22.652
Uh, sure. Yeah. Let's go ahead.

33:22.696 --> 33:25.394
You may be seated. Thank you.

33:28.354 --> 33:31.444
Your Honor, last night
Ted Willoughby on Fox News...

33:31.487 --> 33:33.011
Yes, I-I know who he is.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.838
He accused the two of us
of being complicit

33:34.882 --> 33:36.884
in the murder
of Officer McFinley...

33:36.927 --> 33:38.799
Was this the first time someone
on Fox was mean to you?

33:38.842 --> 33:41.802
We're concerned about
his influence on the jury.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.586
We'd like to ask the jurors
about it.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.545
Your Honor, we already went
through the jurors.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.590
You ruled no mistrial.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.201
This is new influence.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.941
They just want another bite
at the apple.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.508
They want to get
one more juror bumped.

33:52.552 --> 33:55.076
We want an unbiased jury
just like you do.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.556
Just like His Honor does.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.993
And we don't want
the influence of Fox News.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.647
They're playing
on your bias against Fox.

34:00.690 --> 34:05.565
Okay, uh, voir dire de novo
et doctuse.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.002
That's Latin for "the sequel."

34:09.786 --> 34:12.050
Do you know who
Ted Willoughby is?

34:12.093 --> 34:12.963
I do.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.182
And have you watched his show?

34:14.226 --> 34:15.749
Not has she watched his show,

34:15.792 --> 34:17.707
but has she watched his show
last night?

34:17.751 --> 34:19.100
Okay, I'll ask.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.449
Have you watched
the Ted Willoughby show

34:20.493 --> 34:21.450
in the last two days?

34:21.494 --> 34:22.582
Uh, no, I don't watch it.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.584
Some people from my church have,

34:24.627 --> 34:25.933
but I don't like it.

34:25.976 --> 34:27.587
And has anyone from your church
told you

34:27.630 --> 34:29.110
that Ted Willoughby said
that the two of us

34:29.154 --> 34:30.503
are responsible
for the murder...

34:30.546 --> 34:31.895
She just said she didn't see it.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.114
Don't try to fill her in
and create some bias

34:33.158 --> 34:34.724
where there is none.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.248
We take exception to that
characterization, Your Honor.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.945
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come here. All of you.

34:37.988 --> 34:40.817
Uh, no, sorry. Not you.
Uh, sorry, stay.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.124
Um, Counselors,
you two are pushing it.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.083
You get to ask these jurors
one question.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.085
Have they seen this reporter?
And that's it.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.130
And whether they're intimidated
by the presence of cops

34:49.174 --> 34:50.653
-in the courtroom.
-Your Honor...

34:50.697 --> 34:52.133
No, that's
a reasonable question.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.657
And if we get noes
from the jurors, we move on.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.964
-Understood?
Yes.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.140
That didn't go well.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.620
Okay. What now?

35:00.663 --> 35:02.187
Prepare for trial.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.971
I'll see if the jurors' answers
check out.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.584
This is odd.
The case I didn't care about

35:08.628 --> 35:11.413
is going well, and the one
I do care about is cratering.

35:11.457 --> 35:12.893
-Did you see that guy?
-No.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.548
-What?
-It was Joey Battle.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.423
What was Joey Battle doing here?

35:21.467 --> 35:22.859
He met with David Lee.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.166
He's negotiating a contract
with Del Cooper.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.866
Del Cooper to the stand.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.651
I'm sorry, you want...

35:31.694 --> 35:33.174
Del Cooper.

35:33.218 --> 35:36.134
I know he can hear me,
he's in the control room.

35:37.396 --> 35:38.832
Ah. See? Here he comes.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.442
Hey, Hal, uh, Your Honor,

35:40.486 --> 35:42.618
look, I'm really needed
in the control room right now.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.490
If this is a TV show, yes.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.187
But if this is a court, no.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.016
Step up here, Del.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.764
If I take the stand, then
I'm breaking the fourth wall,

35:57.807 --> 35:59.244
and we don't want to do that.

35:59.287 --> 36:00.984
Nobody's breaking any walls.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.944
Sit down in the chair, and
let her ask whatever she wants.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.209
Mr. Cooper,
you had a conversation

36:08.253 --> 36:10.342
with Judge Wackner
prior to this trial, didn't you?

36:10.385 --> 36:12.648
-Objection.
-You were part of that
conversation, Mr. Cord.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.041
So were you.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.999
Exactly. So we all
have to be honest here.

36:16.043 --> 36:19.307
Mr. Cooper,
you encouraged Judge Wackner

36:19.351 --> 36:21.353
to take this Joey Battle case,
didn't you?

36:21.396 --> 36:22.919
I have to object, Your Honor.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.225
This court is entitled
to adjudicate any dispute...

36:24.269 --> 36:25.879
Where are you going with this,
Marissa?

36:25.922 --> 36:27.533
Mr. Cooper, you hoped
to rehabilitate

36:27.576 --> 36:29.883
Joey Battle's career,
isn't that right?

36:29.926 --> 36:32.320
So you could put him back
on your streaming site

36:32.364 --> 36:35.193
for a stand-up you're recording
in St. Louis in 14 days?

36:36.237 --> 36:37.412
No.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.371
I thought it would be good
for this show.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.068
This show?

36:41.111 --> 36:43.723
This show,
meaning Wackner's court?

36:43.766 --> 36:45.420
-This is a mistake, Marissa.
-Is it?

36:45.464 --> 36:47.901
Aren't we just here to discover
the truth, Your Honor?

36:47.944 --> 36:50.120
You have something to say
to me, just say it.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.775
Have you prejudged this case?

36:54.299 --> 36:56.649
Are you questioning
my integrity?

36:56.692 --> 36:57.867
I'm asking if you pre...

36:57.911 --> 36:59.782
No, goddamn it!

36:59.826 --> 37:04.613
You will answer my question
before you ask me yours.

37:04.657 --> 37:07.094
If you've already decided how
this case will end,

37:07.137 --> 37:09.183
Your Honor, if we're here
to give Del the ending

37:09.227 --> 37:11.359
he wants for his TV show
and to make you rich and famous,

37:11.403 --> 37:13.579
-then, yes, I am questioning
your integrity.
-Put the cameras on.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.495
You pack up your things and you
get the fuck out of here.

37:16.538 --> 37:21.282
The women who have trusted this
court deserve representation.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.849
Well,
you should've thought of that

37:22.892 --> 37:24.285
before you ran off
your fucking mouth.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.374
Now, you get the hell
out of my courtroom!

37:29.159 --> 37:31.161
Wow.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.033
Oh, my God.

38:19.514 --> 38:20.776
It happened last night.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.648
Security doesn't know
how they got in.

38:22.691 --> 38:23.823
Of course they don't.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.564
They suggest we call the cops.

38:25.607 --> 38:27.653
We're gonna have to paint.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.176
I called building maintenance.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.352
-They say we may have to wait.
-What? Why?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.093
'Cause we're cop killers.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.008
Liz, Diane...

38:35.051 --> 38:37.184
I think you might want to see

38:37.227 --> 38:38.664
what Ted Willoughby's
been saying lately.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.796
I think we get the idea, Julius.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.451
No, this is something else.

38:43.495 --> 38:47.063
<i>The man who gave his life
to protect his fellow citizens</i>

38:47.107 --> 38:50.458
<i>is dead, but that's not enough
for the two lawyers</i>

38:50.502 --> 38:52.199
<i>spitting on his grave.</i>

38:52.242 --> 38:54.375
<i>The militant Elizabeth Reddick,</i>

38:54.419 --> 38:57.073
<i>daughter of a disgraced
civil rights leader,</i>

38:57.117 --> 39:00.033
<i>and liberal looney tune
Diane Lockhart.</i>

39:00.076 --> 39:03.036
<i>If the name Diane Lockhart
sounds familiar to you,</i>

39:03.079 --> 39:04.994
<i>that may be
because of my colleague</i>

39:05.038 --> 39:07.040
<i>Duke Roscoe's discovery.</i>

39:07.083 --> 39:11.218
<i>He outed her 11 years ago
as a closeted lesbian.</i>

39:11.261 --> 39:14.439
<i>Diane Lockhart
is technically married,</i>

39:14.482 --> 39:17.616
<i>but to a man we rarely see.
Why is that?</i>

39:17.659 --> 39:20.140
<i>Could it be that she
has something more in common</i>

39:20.183 --> 39:22.534
<i>with someone else?</i>

39:22.577 --> 39:24.144
<i>Someone she works with?</i>

39:24.187 --> 39:27.539
<i>She and Liz Reddick
appear to be inseparable.</i>

39:27.582 --> 39:29.758
<i>Is Liz Reddick
Diane Lockhart's new lover?</i>

39:31.456 --> 39:33.371
<i>I'm just asking questions.
There's no way to know for sure,</i>

39:33.414 --> 39:37.026
<i>because Diane Lockhart
and Liz Reddick won't tell us.</i>

39:38.506 --> 39:40.421
<i>These two lipstick lawyers
want the jury to</i>

39:40.465 --> 39:44.120
<i>believe their eyes when they
look at fuzzy cell phone videos.</i>

39:44.164 --> 39:46.688
<i>Why don't they want us
to believe our eyes</i>

39:46.732 --> 39:48.429
<i>when we look at them?</i>

39:59.701 --> 40:00.876
So...

40:00.920 --> 40:03.313
When do I get to meet your son?

40:05.490 --> 40:06.578
I don't know.

40:06.621 --> 40:07.666
Are we that serious?

40:07.709 --> 40:10.495
I don't know. You tell me.

40:10.538 --> 40:11.931
How's Diane?

40:11.974 --> 40:13.585
Mm-hmm.

40:13.628 --> 40:16.588
So, you're telling me,
I have nothing to worry about?

40:16.631 --> 40:17.763
Okay, Diane and I,

40:17.806 --> 40:19.242
-we go a long way back.
-Mm-hmm.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.244
All right? We didn't
become lovers until after

40:21.288 --> 40:24.247
Trump was elected. It was a very
experimental thing.

40:25.466 --> 40:27.773
Yeah, so, uh...
This is a bit, right?

40:27.816 --> 40:30.253
-Yeah, you'll never know.
-Mm-hmm.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.646
I have ways of making you talk.

40:37.870 --> 40:40.350
Shit.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.309
Yeah, it's me.

40:42.352 --> 40:43.789
No.

40:43.832 --> 40:45.878
No, no, no. You tell him "no."

40:45.921 --> 40:47.619
I-I don't care
if it's contractual.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.622
All right? I'm coming down
right now.

40:50.665 --> 40:51.797
Who was that?

40:51.840 --> 40:53.929
That is my secret lover.

40:53.973 --> 40:56.889
-Huh?
-My, uh, latest reality star.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.152
-Yeah.
-Come here.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.242
Mm.

41:02.285 --> 41:05.680
<i>Are you questioning
my integrity?</i>

41:05.724 --> 41:08.509
<i>-I'm asking if you've pre...
-No, goddamn it!</i>

41:08.553 --> 41:12.644
<i>You will answer my question
before you ask me yours.</i>

41:12.687 --> 41:14.472
<i>If you've already decided</i>

41:14.515 --> 41:16.430
<i>how this case will end,
Your Honor,</i>

41:16.474 --> 41:18.519
<i>if we're here to give Del
the ending he wants</i>

41:18.563 --> 41:20.521
<i>for his TV show,
and to make you rich and famous,</i>

41:20.565 --> 41:23.481
<i>then yes,
I am questioning your integrity.</i>

41:23.524 --> 41:25.657
<i>You pack up your things,
and you get the...</i>

41:25.700 --> 41:27.963
Hey, hey, hey, man.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.399
-Judge.
-Hmm?

41:29.443 --> 41:30.531
Look...

41:30.575 --> 41:32.751
you lost your temper.
Okay?

41:32.794 --> 41:34.796
It's no big deal.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.537
I'm Pol Pot.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.844
-I'm Ceausescu.
No. No.

41:38.887 --> 41:40.454
Man, look.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.457
One of the biggest moments
in reality TV history

41:43.501 --> 41:47.983
was Tyra Banks losing her shit
on <i>America's Top Model.</i>

41:48.027 --> 41:50.464
She had a meltdown.
Meltdowns are good TV.

41:52.205 --> 41:54.381
Pick up, Marissa. Pick up.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.514
Come on. Come on.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.037
Pick up.

42:05.435 --> 42:06.741
I'm here.

42:06.785 --> 42:09.048
Hey...

42:09.091 --> 42:11.006
I want you to come back
to court.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.399
<i>I want you to finish your cases.</i>

42:12.442 --> 42:13.661
Why?

42:13.705 --> 42:15.881
Because I made a mistake.

42:15.924 --> 42:17.578
I was an asshole.

42:17.622 --> 42:18.710
You were right.

42:18.753 --> 42:20.581
<i>Do you want me to apologize?</i>

42:20.625 --> 42:21.843
<i>I will.</i>

42:21.887 --> 42:23.584
Yeah, actually, I do.

42:23.628 --> 42:26.065
I'm sorry.

42:26.108 --> 42:28.023
I was biased.

42:28.067 --> 42:31.200
<i>I won't be when you come back.</i>

42:31.244 --> 42:33.638
I'm taking this seriously,
Your Honor.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.204
I know you are.

42:35.248 --> 42:37.206
That's why I want you back.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.469
You got to finish it.

42:44.649 --> 42:45.911
Thank you. Come in.

42:45.954 --> 42:50.655
Uh, hey.
Thank you for stopping by.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.613
Um...

42:52.657 --> 42:54.528
I...

42:54.572 --> 42:57.575
I've been worried that
I was insensitive,

42:57.618 --> 43:00.186
and I wanted to get
a gut check from both of you.

43:00.229 --> 43:02.318
Sure, Your Honor. What is it?

43:02.362 --> 43:04.190
I've been watching the two
of you throughout the case,

43:04.233 --> 43:06.366
and I realized,
after what I heard last night,

43:06.409 --> 43:09.108
that, uh, your discomfort...

43:09.151 --> 43:11.806
made sense to me.

43:12.677 --> 43:17.290
If my wife and I ever
tried to work together,

43:17.333 --> 43:18.987
our relationship wouldn't last

43:19.031 --> 43:21.468
ten minutes.

43:21.511 --> 43:24.384
So, yeah, more power to you.

43:24.427 --> 43:27.300
I just... I'm a great friend
of the LGBTQ,

43:27.343 --> 43:30.695
uh, plus, you know, community.

43:30.738 --> 43:33.175
Thank you, Your Honor.

43:34.829 --> 43:36.831
Yeah, um...

43:36.875 --> 43:38.528
Yeah, actually, you know what?

43:38.572 --> 43:40.792
Your Honor, there is, there is
something that you could...

43:40.835 --> 43:42.750
could settle for us.

43:42.794 --> 43:44.317
Oh, great. Certainly. Yeah.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.798
One of the jurors, uh,
the one from the church?

43:47.712 --> 43:50.497
Uh, I think she's noticed
how close we are together.

43:50.540 --> 43:51.977
And, uh...

43:52.020 --> 43:53.500
I-I hope you
don't mind me saying this.

43:53.543 --> 43:55.981
No, it's been on my mind
as well. She did...

43:56.024 --> 43:58.070
She did see us
out in the hall...

43:58.113 --> 43:59.506
Yeah.
-...together.

43:59.549 --> 44:01.987
Yeah, and, uh, uh,
we're just worried

44:02.030 --> 44:05.164
that our relationship
may have played into her bias.

44:05.207 --> 44:07.906
It would just be good
to be certain.

44:07.949 --> 44:10.125
Don't you think, darling?

44:14.564 --> 44:16.001
So, you go ahead
and ask your questions.

44:16.044 --> 44:17.567
Show what a terrible
person I am.

44:17.611 --> 44:21.049
I guarantee you, I already know,
so does everyone else.

44:21.093 --> 44:23.356
Yeah, that's
sort of your schtick,

44:23.399 --> 44:25.184
saying how awful you are.

44:25.227 --> 44:27.708
My schtick? No, it's the,
the voices in my head.

44:27.752 --> 44:29.405
No. Oof.

44:29.449 --> 44:31.407
-I'm an asshole. Good one.

44:31.451 --> 44:33.758
Seems like you feel
pretty sorry for yourself.

44:33.801 --> 44:35.411
I do? I'm sorry.

44:35.455 --> 44:39.024
But you don't feel sorry for
how you treat other people.

44:39.067 --> 44:40.852
Is that a question?

44:40.895 --> 44:43.463
<i>You want to make it
in this business? Be ruthless.</i>

44:43.506 --> 44:45.508
<i>The only thing that matters
is your material.</i>

44:45.552 --> 44:47.859
<i>Other people, they're not real.</i>

44:47.902 --> 44:50.949
<i>You can't worry
about their feelings.</i>

44:50.992 --> 44:52.298
<i>The minute you care...</i>

44:52.341 --> 44:54.387
<i>comedy dies.</i>

44:54.430 --> 44:56.519
"Other people are not real."

44:56.563 --> 44:59.435
That was four years ago.
I'm a different person.

44:59.479 --> 45:02.134
Two nights ago,
you did a set at 2:00 a.m.

45:02.177 --> 45:03.613
at The Side Room downtown.

45:03.657 --> 45:06.268
I-I was testing out
some material.

45:06.312 --> 45:08.488
Trying some stuff out.

45:08.531 --> 45:10.185
<i>So there's all these
stupid women out there</i>

45:10.229 --> 45:14.407
<i>who are going around saying,
"Oh, he did awful things to me."</i>

45:14.450 --> 45:17.323
<i>Which just makes it harder,
in this day and age,</i>

45:17.366 --> 45:20.413
<i>for me to convince other women
to let me do awful things</i>

45:20.456 --> 45:21.762
<i>to them,
which I want to do because</i>

45:21.806 --> 45:23.982
<i>-I'm a male human being!</i>

45:24.025 --> 45:25.853
<i>You'd think people would
understand that by now,</i>

45:25.897 --> 45:28.595
<i>but they seem to be completely
hung up on the whole...</i>

45:28.638 --> 45:31.250
<i>"doing awful things" aspect.</i>

45:31.293 --> 45:32.817
Is that the new you?

45:32.860 --> 45:34.079
No.

45:34.122 --> 45:35.428
That is... Look.

45:35.471 --> 45:37.647
Comedy, it's, um...

45:37.691 --> 45:38.910
I do bits.

45:38.953 --> 45:40.781
It's a mercurial, kind of...

45:40.825 --> 45:42.827
They're not real.
It's not, you know, it's...

45:42.870 --> 45:46.178
What you got to look at is
they're just a whatchamacall--

45:46.221 --> 45:47.875
Like a-- Ah.

45:53.446 --> 45:54.926
The time has come.

45:54.969 --> 45:56.275
I am ready to rule.

45:57.232 --> 45:59.321
Henrietta, you were born free,

45:59.365 --> 46:01.628
and I return you
to your natural state.

46:02.977 --> 46:04.065
What does that mean?

46:04.109 --> 46:05.284
It means you may go.

46:05.327 --> 46:07.286
What you did
falls under the category

46:07.329 --> 46:08.940
of "awful but lawful."

46:08.983 --> 46:11.638
And we here at
the Circuit Court of 9 3/4

46:11.681 --> 46:14.684
are not in the business of
regulating manners.

46:14.728 --> 46:15.947
So, goodbye.

46:15.990 --> 46:18.819
Your Honor,
that's actually not what I want.

46:18.863 --> 46:20.386
It isn't?

46:20.429 --> 46:21.648
What does that mean?

46:21.691 --> 46:24.216
It would help me get my job back

46:24.259 --> 46:26.218
if the school knew
I was being punished.

46:26.261 --> 46:27.959
You want to be punished?

46:28.002 --> 46:29.351
Yes, please.

46:29.395 --> 46:32.311
It's the only way
I can be uncanceled.

46:32.354 --> 46:35.096
If they know the canceling
was satisfied.

46:35.140 --> 46:38.056
I have only one word for that...

46:38.099 --> 46:39.448
Oy.

46:39.492 --> 46:43.496
But sure.
I penalize you to, um...

46:43.539 --> 46:45.541
cleaning the school bathrooms
for a week.

46:46.368 --> 46:48.022
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-Anytime.

46:48.066 --> 46:50.285
-Good luck.

46:50.329 --> 46:51.373
And now Joey Battle.

46:51.417 --> 46:53.071
Yes, Your Honor. Yes.

46:53.114 --> 46:56.465
Joey, as you can see, the score
really isn't in your favor.

46:56.509 --> 46:58.206
I understand you want
your career back.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.556
You are a funny man.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.210
It takes hard work to get funny.

47:02.254 --> 47:03.864
Maybe you think that's enough.

47:03.908 --> 47:07.085
But you haven't done anything
for the women you hurt.

47:07.128 --> 47:08.347
You haven't made amends.

47:08.390 --> 47:10.088
Your Honor, I...

47:10.131 --> 47:11.829
I brought my checkbook.

47:11.872 --> 47:13.482
You're a rich man, Joey.
I think everyone here

47:13.526 --> 47:15.006
knows the minute
you go back to work,

47:15.049 --> 47:16.834
you'll earn back your fine
in no time.

47:16.877 --> 47:19.619
Your Honor, everybody deserves
a second chance.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.708
You know the expression,
"doing your time"?

47:21.751 --> 47:24.711
Your Honor, I haven't worked
a major venue in over a year.

47:24.754 --> 47:27.235
How much time
do you want me to take?

47:27.279 --> 47:31.544
Doing time means more than
taking time.

47:31.587 --> 47:33.851
It means serving your sentence.

47:33.894 --> 47:35.200
Going to prison.

47:35.243 --> 47:37.506
You want to come back? Okay.

47:37.550 --> 47:39.944
First, you got to do your time.

47:39.987 --> 47:42.033
Three-week sentence.

47:42.076 --> 47:43.382
June.

47:43.425 --> 47:45.036
-Yes?
-Please.

47:45.079 --> 47:47.560
Come. Here you go.

47:47.603 --> 47:49.040
Go ahead. Cuff him.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.303
Is this some kind of a metaphor
or something?

47:51.346 --> 47:53.044
-Like an adult time-out?
-Yes, Joey.

47:53.087 --> 47:55.655
That's exactly what prison is,
an adult time-out.

47:55.698 --> 47:58.049
You keep saying pri-- Uh,
this is a joke, though, right?

47:58.092 --> 48:01.226
June.
I said cuff him.

48:01.269 --> 48:02.575
Now.

48:02.618 --> 48:04.925
Your Honor,
you can't just send him...

48:04.969 --> 48:07.362
W-What prison
are you talking about?

48:07.406 --> 48:08.537
There is no prison.

48:08.581 --> 48:10.104
Oh, boy, there is.

48:10.148 --> 48:12.933
This court's benefactor
owns a private prison company.

48:12.977 --> 48:16.763
He's offered us a wing in one
of his bankrupted institutions.

48:16.806 --> 48:18.591
Lucky you, Joey.

48:18.634 --> 48:19.940
You're the first person
I'm sending there.

48:19.984 --> 48:21.594
Oh, my God.

48:21.637 --> 48:23.422
June, he harmed you.

48:23.465 --> 48:25.815
Go ahead. Cuff him.

48:29.036 --> 48:31.430
You're going to escort him
to his cell.

48:31.473 --> 48:32.910
In this court, you get to see

48:32.953 --> 48:34.999
the person you're sending away,
eye to eye.

48:35.042 --> 48:36.435
Hey, Your Honor.

48:36.478 --> 48:38.785
Let's, uh...
let's make it two weeks, okay?

48:38.828 --> 48:42.180
I know. You have your
stand-up in St. Louis.

48:42.223 --> 48:43.790
Three weeks.

48:43.833 --> 48:45.313
-Recess,

48:45.357 --> 48:48.316
then we have
the Exxon Mobile case.

49:08.597 --> 49:10.295
This is really happening,
isn't it?

49:10.338 --> 49:11.992
It sure looks like it.

49:27.529 --> 49:29.575
Turn around.

49:37.365 --> 49:40.281
June...

49:40.325 --> 49:41.891
I'm sorry.

49:44.068 --> 49:45.460
You're forgiven.

50:04.697 --> 50:06.960
Good afternoon, ladies.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.441
Thanks for coming in
on short notice.

50:12.096 --> 50:15.969
I hear there's been a lot
of tension between you two.

50:16.752 --> 50:18.711
No, everything's fine.

50:18.754 --> 50:21.192
Oh, good to know.

50:21.235 --> 50:26.762
Well, Human Resources
needs you two to sign these.

50:32.464 --> 50:34.074
A love contract?

50:34.118 --> 50:35.249
Yes.

50:35.293 --> 50:37.773
When employees
embark on a relationship,

50:37.817 --> 50:39.993
it's policy for us to confirm,
in writing,

50:40.037 --> 50:42.561
that the relationship
is consensual.

50:43.823 --> 50:46.869
We in H.R. just want to avoid
problems later.

50:46.913 --> 50:50.656
Sometimes romances
don't work out.

51:03.364 --> 51:04.931
Good.

51:04.974 --> 51:07.412
Good. I hope you two
patch things up.

51:07.455 --> 51:10.371
This is the first step.
