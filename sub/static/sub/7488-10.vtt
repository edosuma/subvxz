00:11.000 --> 00:15.730
Am I dreaming or are you
guys reading a book?

00:15.760 --> 00:17.670
It's the book of world records.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.770
Me and dez are gonna
set a world record.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.540
How about the world's
longest fingernails?

00:23.580 --> 00:24.940
Nah. How could we
ever go bowling?

00:26.740 --> 00:29.650
Here's one... keeping your
eyes open without blinking.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.650
Ooh! Time me!

00:34.920 --> 00:36.950
-Hey. -Shh! Dez is
trying to set the record

00:36.980 --> 00:39.720
For not blinking.
Nobody bother him

00:39.750 --> 00:41.950
For 30 hours and 12 minutes.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.760
I can't go on! I give up.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.590
Ahhh. How long was that?

00:47.630 --> 00:49.630
Eight seconds.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.000
I think ally has a shot

00:52.030 --> 00:54.800
At breaking the
not-blinking record.

00:58.670 --> 01:00.640
Staring at dallas? What?!

01:00.680 --> 01:02.070
No, that's ridiculous.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.780
Just go talk to him.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.680
-It's not that easy.
-Sure it is.

01:06.710 --> 01:08.920
Hey, dallas!

01:13.550 --> 01:15.620
And apparently I'm
gonna talk to him.

01:20.630 --> 01:21.730
Hey, dallas.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.530
Did you see that crazy
story on the news?

01:24.560 --> 01:26.630
What story?

01:26.670 --> 01:29.900
Uh, which one were
you talking about?

01:31.600 --> 01:33.670
I wasn't. You brought it up.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.710
I know, right?

01:37.740 --> 01:39.710
Well, great talking to you.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.650
Wait, ally. I've been wanting to
come by the store and say hi,

01:43.680 --> 01:46.790
I just haven't had time. After
work I always have chores.

01:46.820 --> 01:50.690
Like today I have to mow my lawn.
It's the worst.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.590
I can mow your lawn for you!

01:53.630 --> 01:56.030
Why would I say that?

01:56.060 --> 01:57.960
Really? You'd mow
my lawn for me?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.970
Yep. That's what I
heard myself say.

02:01.970 --> 02:03.670
Thanks!

02:05.770 --> 02:07.940
-How'd it go? -Great.

02:07.970 --> 02:10.509
Can anybody teach me
how to mow a lawn?

02:10.539 --> 02:11.880
There's no time for that, ally.

02:11.910 --> 02:15.610
I'm about to set the record for
the world's biggest brain freeze.

02:15.650 --> 02:17.610
Um, dez, there's no
record for that.

03:22.580 --> 03:26.820
I can't believe you mowed
every lawn on dallas's block.

03:26.850 --> 03:29.650
After I mowed his lawn, it
just looked so much better

03:29.690 --> 03:32.520
Than all the other lawns.
I felt bad for them.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.930
Well, when you say it like
that it makes so much sense.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.590
What's all this stuff?

03:38.630 --> 03:40.600
It's our inventory
for the entire year.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.600
My dad orders everything at once

03:42.630 --> 03:44.670
So he can save like $4.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.000
$4.36.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.600
Ooh, ally,

03:49.640 --> 03:52.010
I need you to carry these
boxes upstairs for me.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.780
- You know I have a bad back.
- There's a lot of boxes.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.750
Can we maybe hire
someone to help?

03:57.780 --> 04:00.580
I'm in-between jobs right now.
I'd love to work here.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.780
-I don't think so.
-Absolutely not.

04:02.820 --> 04:05.650
Why not? I'd be a
great employee.

04:05.690 --> 04:08.960
Trish, you've had 30
jobs in the last month.

04:08.990 --> 04:11.590
You've never even kept
a job for three days.

04:11.630 --> 04:14.560
That hurts. I worked
at a calendar store

04:14.600 --> 04:17.769
For almost a week. And I know
because it was a calendar store.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.940
It wasn't a week.
It was a weekend.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.670
And I know because
you called in sick

04:23.710 --> 04:25.640
And I filled in for
you for both days.

04:27.780 --> 04:30.680
Ally, we can't afford
to hire trish.

04:30.710 --> 04:32.680
We can't afford to hire anyone.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.720
It's just me and you.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.550
Actually, it's just you.

04:37.590 --> 04:39.890
It's free sample time
at the food court. Hee!

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Check it out. Me and
dez are going to set

04:46.030 --> 04:48.800
The world record for spinning
a basketball on our finger.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.570
The old record is 22
hours and 12 minutes.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.000
We are going to demolish it!

04:53.040 --> 04:55.640
What up?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.870
Which one of you doofs is
going to set the record?

04:57.910 --> 05:01.640
- What do you mean? -There can
only be one record holder.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.880
Probably me. I'm getting
pretty good at this.

05:04.910 --> 05:07.520
It's gonna take a lot
more than pretty good

05:07.550 --> 05:10.590
To beat very pretty good.

05:12.990 --> 05:15.660
Oh, it's on!

05:17.900 --> 05:19.860
Okay. It'll be on later.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.670
Hey, ally.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.910
I wanted to thank you
for mowing my lawn.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.940
You don't have to thank me.

05:31.980 --> 05:35.650
I was already mowing
in the neighborhood.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.680
Yeah, Wednesday is
ally's mowing day.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.850
Well, I gotta get back to work.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.890
The boss only gives me
a five-minute break.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.890
You think your job stinks?
You should work here.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.830
Yeah. I'll see you later, ally.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.960
Not if your eyes are closed!

06:01.040 --> 06:03.710
Why am I still laughing?

06:04.910 --> 06:06.710
Not sure.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.650
There's nothing funny about what just
happened between you and dallas.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.590
91, 92,

06:19.630 --> 06:23.560
93, 94...

06:23.600 --> 06:25.930
- What are you doing?
- Strengthening my finger muscles

06:25.960 --> 06:28.600
So I can crush the
basketball spinning record.

06:28.630 --> 06:31.600
Feel the burn, feel the burn!

06:35.540 --> 06:36.940
Am I supposed to be impressed?

06:36.980 --> 06:39.780
This morning I
finger-walked three miles.

06:42.820 --> 06:46.890
Well, I went finger...
finger bungee jumping.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.800
Well, can you spin a
16 pound cinder block

07:00.830 --> 07:02.970
On your finger?

07:05.740 --> 07:07.510
Oh, you amateur.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.510
Spinning something
heavy won't help you.

07:09.540 --> 07:11.680
The key is to spin something
light and delicate.

07:11.710 --> 07:13.810
That's why I brought all
my mom's good china.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.480
Observe.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.780
<i>Hang on.</i>

07:20.790 --> 07:22.620
Hang on.

07:22.660 --> 07:23.820
Hang on.

07:25.590 --> 07:26.860
Hang on.

07:27.860 --> 07:29.760
Hang on.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.830
Hang on.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.800
Hang on.

07:34.840 --> 07:35.970
Hang on.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.780
-Hey, Ally. -Oh, Dallas.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.810
-I'm ready to start work. -Huh?

07:44.850 --> 07:48.550
Yesterday you said, "if you think your
job stinks, you should work here,"

07:48.580 --> 07:51.550
So I quit my job at the
cellphone cart and here I am.

07:51.590 --> 07:53.790
I said that?

07:53.820 --> 07:56.930
You think your job stinks?
You should work here.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.530
I said that!

07:59.560 --> 08:01.960
So now you work here now.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.570
Welcome aboard.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.630
So, what can I do?

08:06.670 --> 08:09.970
Um, you can move this box
up to the storage room.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.610
Real quick. Let's just
say you wanted to get

08:15.640 --> 08:17.640
Your job at the
cellphone cart back...

08:17.680 --> 08:20.610
It's too late. They already
gave my job to somebody else.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.550
Guess who got a job at the
cellphone accessory cart?

08:26.820 --> 08:28.590
What?

08:36.559 --> 08:39.360
I can't believe you hired
dallas and not me.

08:39.390 --> 08:41.230
I didn't hire him on purpose.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.400
Sorry.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.340
You're doing great.

08:48.370 --> 08:50.640
He's a terrible employee.

08:50.670 --> 08:53.680
Then why don't you fire him?

08:53.710 --> 08:57.610
I can't. He quit his other job
to work here because of me.

08:57.650 --> 09:00.620
And now he can't get his job back
because somebody else took it.

09:00.650 --> 09:03.220
Don't blame me.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.290
You can't fire him because you
have a humongous crush on him.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.490
I know, it's just
easier to blame you.

09:10.290 --> 09:11.566
What are you gonna
do about your dad?

09:11.590 --> 09:13.506
- I'm just gonna tell him the truth.
- Hey, ally.

09:13.530 --> 09:16.200
Nobody new works here!

09:16.230 --> 09:19.440
-Huh? -Help me out here.

09:19.470 --> 09:22.500
I can't. I have to
get back to my job

09:22.540 --> 09:25.540
If I'm gonna prove to somebody that
I can keep a job for three days.

09:25.580 --> 09:27.480
By the way, has it
been three days yet?

09:29.210 --> 09:32.650
-It's been two hours. -Man!

09:32.680 --> 09:35.220
How do people do this?

09:38.550 --> 09:40.290
Excuse me, sir?

09:40.320 --> 09:42.660
I just want to say I'm
happy to be onboard.

09:42.690 --> 09:45.590
Ooo-kay?

09:48.530 --> 09:50.600
Onboard? Weird, huh?

09:50.630 --> 09:53.330
That guy thinks he's on a boat.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.340
Aye aye, captain!

10:05.650 --> 10:08.280
Welcome, everybody. You
are about to witness

10:08.320 --> 10:10.550
Record-breaking history!

10:10.590 --> 10:14.220
In less than 24 hours, one of
us will hold the world record

10:14.260 --> 10:15.690
For spinning a basketball.

10:15.730 --> 10:19.600
And by "one of us"
he means "me."

10:19.630 --> 10:23.230
And by "me" he means "me."

10:23.270 --> 10:25.730
"I'm confused."

10:29.310 --> 10:31.510
Anyway,

10:31.540 --> 10:33.440
These official record
book officials

10:33.480 --> 10:36.510
Will be officially recording
our official times.

10:36.550 --> 10:37.710
Officially!

10:41.420 --> 10:43.350
Ready? Go!

10:48.490 --> 10:50.430
I could do this all day.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.460
Me too.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.270
Wait, did you mean spin
the ball or stare?

10:55.300 --> 10:57.570
"I'm confused."

10:59.340 --> 11:01.410
-The ball. -Good,

11:01.440 --> 11:03.470
'cause you know I
stink at staring.

11:10.280 --> 11:14.520
You sure you're not upset I
sold that $500 guitar for $50?

11:14.550 --> 11:16.620
Oh, that's okay.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.530
You didn't see the extra
zero on the price tag.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.360
-There was a price tag? -Wow.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.400
So what can I do now?

11:27.430 --> 11:29.600
I need you to...

11:29.640 --> 11:32.540
Take all these picks
out of the jar,

11:32.570 --> 11:34.540
Separate them by color,

11:34.570 --> 11:37.680
Then mix them up again and
put them back in the jar.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.510
Okay.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.480
-How's it going? -Horrible.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.590
Horrible great or horrible bad?

11:48.590 --> 11:50.720
There's only one
kind of horrible.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.620
Dallas is not the
greatest worker,

11:53.660 --> 11:56.530
So I have to put all these
boxes away by myself.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.660
-We'll help you. -Are you sure

11:58.700 --> 12:01.500
You'll be able to carry boxes
while spinning those balls?

12:01.530 --> 12:03.500
It's easy.

12:06.510 --> 12:09.340
I can carry two boxes.

12:09.370 --> 12:11.680
Three boxes and a birthday cake.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.610
Why do you have a birthday cake?

12:14.650 --> 12:17.380
Uh, because they were
out of wedding cakes.

12:22.660 --> 12:25.320
-Hey, boss. -Boss?

12:25.360 --> 12:28.700
Hey, boss. That's what all the
kids are saying these days.

12:28.730 --> 12:31.500
Hey, boss! What's up, boss?

12:31.530 --> 12:34.330
Nothin'. Just chillin', boss.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.470
Whatever you say, boss.

12:42.380 --> 12:45.240
Sorry, we dropped the boxes.
We were just trying to help.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.650
You know, because the
guy ally hired stinks.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.720
He's not getting any of my cake.

12:53.490 --> 12:57.390
Ally, you want to explain
what's going on?

12:57.420 --> 13:00.290
Well, I kind of

13:00.330 --> 13:02.360
Accidentally hired
dallas to work here

13:02.400 --> 13:05.430
And I know I need to let him go, but I
can't because trish has his old job,

13:05.470 --> 13:07.670
- And even though he's bad
at zeroes, he... look, ally.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.200
This is your mess.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.510
You know we can't afford
another employee.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.240
You have to fire dallas.

13:17.450 --> 13:20.380
I know. You're right.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.390
- Hey, dallas. -I'm almost
done with the picks.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.560
I broke a couple.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.300
How did you...?

13:35.330 --> 13:37.430
That's okay. Listen,

13:37.470 --> 13:39.500
I really enjoy having
you around here, but...

13:39.540 --> 13:42.540
Thanks so much for
giving me this job.

13:42.570 --> 13:45.410
I love it here. And
the best part?

13:45.440 --> 13:47.480
I get to see you every day.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.550
Aw, really?

13:52.580 --> 13:54.720
Aw, really?!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.830
I couldn't fire dallas. I tried,

14:04.860 --> 14:07.800
But he started talking about how
much he likes hanging out with me

14:07.830 --> 14:11.040
And I ended up
giving him a raise.

14:11.070 --> 14:13.570
I like hanging out with you.

14:13.610 --> 14:15.740
I'm not giving you any money.

14:15.770 --> 14:19.040
- Listen, Trish -fine,
I'll fire dallas for you.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.710
That's not what I was gonna ask.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.610
Are you sure? Because
I'd fire him good.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.980
Real good.

14:27.020 --> 14:29.620
No.

14:29.650 --> 14:33.060
I want you to quit your job so we
can get dallas his old job back.

14:33.090 --> 14:34.820
I'm not quitting.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.760
I'll admit at first I was
only keeping this job

14:37.790 --> 14:40.730
To prove a point. But
I actually like it.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.670
I get to talk on
the phone all day,

14:43.700 --> 14:46.700
And it turns out I'm
great at bejeweling.

14:53.110 --> 14:55.880
Wow, you're good at a job?

14:56.950 --> 14:59.650
Oh, what am I gonna do?

15:00.950 --> 15:04.720
Listen, I know this
is hard for you.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.990
If it'll make it
easier, I'll quit.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.960
-Really? -Heh, no.

15:10.690 --> 15:13.730
But I'll tell you what: I'll
teach you how to fire dallas.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.900
I've picked up a few things
from being fired 307 times.

15:19.930 --> 15:21.970
What's up, girls?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.840
I can't believe you guys
haven't messed up yet.

15:24.870 --> 15:27.710
Please. This is the easiest
thing I've ever done.

15:27.740 --> 15:30.940
It's the easier-est
thing I've ever done.

16:00.740 --> 16:02.980
Okay, you wanna fire someone,

16:03.010 --> 16:04.780
You got options.

16:04.810 --> 16:07.680
You need to find out
what works for you.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.890
I like to keep it simple. I
call this "the classic fire."

16:13.960 --> 16:15.760
Dallas? You're fired!

16:15.790 --> 16:17.960
Pack up your stuff and
get out of my face!

16:19.630 --> 16:21.860
That seems a little harsh.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.770
Okay, then there's
"the friendly fire."

16:28.770 --> 16:31.640
dallas, you're fired.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.610
Pack up your stuff and
get out of my face.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.780
That still sounds
a little harsh.

16:42.050 --> 16:44.960
Really? Wow.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.660
Okay, here's this!

16:47.690 --> 16:49.660
"the silent fire."

16:55.700 --> 16:57.900
Fine. Let's try something else.

16:57.940 --> 17:01.040
I'll be dallas. Show
me how you'd fire me.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.910
Hey, ally.

17:07.950 --> 17:10.680
Your hair looks
really nice today.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.849
Really?

17:12.880 --> 17:15.619
'cause I've been using
this new conditioner.

17:15.650 --> 17:17.650
I mean, hey, dallas,

17:17.690 --> 17:19.690
There's something we
need to talk about.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.589
I know, I was late.

17:21.619 --> 17:23.619
I'm sorry. My bike had
a flat tire and...

17:23.660 --> 17:25.730
I can fix it for you!

17:25.760 --> 17:27.960
Ally!

17:28.000 --> 17:30.030
You should just let me fire him.

17:30.070 --> 17:31.830
I know the perfect way.

17:31.870 --> 17:35.910
I call it "the big whammo
public humiliation fire."

17:35.940 --> 17:38.910
I'm gonna need a marching band, a
gospel choir, a juggling bear...

17:38.940 --> 17:40.780
No, I should do it.

17:42.780 --> 17:44.780
Fine. But you're too nice.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.620
You need to be worked
up to fire dallas.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.590
Isn't there anything
that makes you angry?

17:50.620 --> 17:53.060
Well, I really don't
like when people

17:53.090 --> 17:56.590
Talk with food in their mouth.

17:56.630 --> 17:58.060
Oh, and when people
say "liberry"

17:58.100 --> 17:59.900
Instead of "library."

17:59.930 --> 18:03.700
Or what about the noise styrofoam
makes when you rub it together?

18:03.730 --> 18:06.800
I hate that!

18:06.840 --> 18:08.900
Okay, ally. This is good.

18:08.940 --> 18:10.710
Yeah, I can do this.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.010
I'm gonna fire him when he
shows up for work later.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.050
Great! Let's get you worked up.

18:17.820 --> 18:20.950
Liberry, liberry, liberry...

18:26.060 --> 18:29.760
I can't believe we're five minutes
away from breaking the old record.

18:29.790 --> 18:32.860
Soon the new record
will belong to me.

18:32.900 --> 18:35.570
Unless something happens that
makes you drop the ball.

18:41.910 --> 18:45.010
Guys, stop it. What
are you doing?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.840
You're best friends.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.050
Are you really fighting over getting
your name in some stupid book?

18:52.080 --> 18:53.950
Sorry. I'm sure
it's a great book.

18:57.990 --> 19:00.760
Ally's right. We're being silly.

19:00.790 --> 19:02.860
Yeah, I don't even care
if I get the record.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.000
In fact, I hope you get it.

19:05.030 --> 19:08.700
You know what, I'm
gonna let you win.

19:12.570 --> 19:14.540
Wow, thanks, man.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.910
You know what?

19:15.940 --> 19:18.010
I'm gonna let you win.

19:20.980 --> 19:24.650
What are you doing?!
I already lost!

19:24.690 --> 19:28.060
-You were about to set the record.
-Oh man!

19:30.960 --> 19:34.630
- What do you wanna do now? -I
gotta go buy my mom new plates.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.860
Okay, I can do this.

19:39.900 --> 19:43.870
Oh, dallas, I need
to talk to you.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.710
I need to talk to you too.

19:45.740 --> 19:47.040
I have to quit working here.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.080
There's no easy way to
say this but... what?

19:51.910 --> 19:53.750
-You're quitting? -Yeah.

19:53.780 --> 19:56.720
I'm really sorry, but I
got another job and...

19:56.750 --> 19:58.850
Are you kidding?!

19:58.890 --> 20:02.060
You're not gonna work here anymore?
Man!

20:02.090 --> 20:04.790
That's horrible. What happened?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.830
That stinks! Why?

20:06.860 --> 20:08.900
Well, I got a new
job at the <i>liberry.</i>

20:08.930 --> 20:12.600
Ohh, <i>library? Really?</i>

20:12.630 --> 20:14.000
Yeah, my mom's a liberrian...

20:14.040 --> 20:16.900
And she's been trying
to get me to work

20:16.940 --> 20:19.670
At the liberry for a while.

20:19.710 --> 20:23.010
Darn! Darny darn darn.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.780
Let me just take that
last box up before I go

20:30.120 --> 20:31.950
Sorry.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.950
You couldn't do it, could you?

20:35.990 --> 20:38.760
I didn't have to. He quit.

20:38.790 --> 20:41.730
-He got another job. -He quit?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.960
-Uh-oh. -What do you mean uh-oh?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.730
I knew you couldn't go
through with firing him,

20:46.770 --> 20:49.030
So I kinda took matters
into my own hands.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.660
Really? A marching band?

21:13.690 --> 21:15.830
Um, th-there's more.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.760
You're so fired, oooh,
you're so fired

21:18.800 --> 21:22.800
in fact, you were never hired

21:22.840 --> 21:25.640
you're so fired, oooh,
you're so fired

21:25.670 --> 21:28.810
<i>ally wants to fire you because
you stink at what you do</i>

21:28.840 --> 21:32.710
ally wants to fire you because
you stink at what you do

21:32.750 --> 21:34.780
you're fired, oooh.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.960
So that's the big whammo
public humiliation fire

21:51.000 --> 21:52.930
I was telling you about.

21:52.970 --> 21:55.000
Usually ends with
a juggling bear.

21:55.030 --> 21:57.140
Next time.

22:10.820 --> 22:13.050
Oh, dallas,

22:13.090 --> 22:17.920
I am so sorry about the whole
firing-you, marching-band thing.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.730
It's okay, I probably
deserved it.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.730
I wasn't the best employee.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.976
I just... I get so nervous
when I'm around you sometimes.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.730
You get nervous around <i>me?</i>

22:27.770 --> 22:29.840
Around nervous I get you.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.810
-See? -I should
probably get going.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.980
I have to work at the liberry.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.820
So I'm guessing no more crush
since he says liberry?

22:43.850 --> 22:46.820
Actually it's kinda
cute when he says it.

22:46.850 --> 22:49.060
Well, on a more important note,

22:49.090 --> 22:52.990
Guess who kept her job at the
cellphone cart for three whole days?

22:53.030 --> 22:55.830
Not you. It's only
been two days.

22:55.860 --> 22:58.760
What? I just quit!

22:58.800 --> 23:01.900
Aw man. Oh well.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.870
Hey! We've decided to
set new world records.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.010
I'm gonna be the
world's oldest man,

23:09.040 --> 23:10.880
Starting... Now!

23:12.780 --> 23:14.880
Whew, only 107 years to go.

23:16.050 --> 23:18.780
And I'm going to be the
world's best plate spinner.

23:19.850 --> 23:22.050
Starting... Now!

23:23.060 --> 23:24.720
<i>Hang on.</i>

23:26.660 --> 23:27.930
Hang on.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.030
Hang on.

23:31.730 --> 23:33.070
Hang on.
