00:02.003 --> 00:03.243
[man] Previously on Lost:

00:03.337 --> 00:04.998
Can you hear me?

00:05.089 --> 00:08.707
Yes, yes, I can hear you.
Hey, are you on the boat?

00:08.801 --> 00:10.666
- What boat?
- Your boat.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.717
- I’m not on a boat.
- Uh...

00:12.805 --> 00:16.263
- Naomi parachuted.
- Who... who’s Naomi?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.601
I've got it! I've got a signal!

00:17.685 --> 00:21.177
It's gonna work. It's happening.
We're gonna get off this island.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.352
[wet thud]

00:25.443 --> 00:27.604
[Penny] Hello? Is Desmond there?

00:28.404 --> 00:29.439
Penny!

00:29.947 --> 00:31.232
No!

00:33.784 --> 00:37.368
I'm telling you, making that call
is the beginning of the end.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.117
- Who is this?
- [man] Who is this?

00:42.043 --> 00:45.456
I'm one of the survivors
of Oceanic flight 815.

00:46.923 --> 00:50.040
- Can you get a fix on our location?
- Sit tight.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.920
- [chatter]
- We’ll be right there.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.025
[sirens]

01:16.994 --> 01:18.404
[tires screech]

01:20.790 --> 01:25.329
[woman on TV] ...a/most 30 minutes since
the start of this high-speed chase.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.582
Still have no information
about who's driving this vehicle.

01:28.673 --> 01:31.665
Jeff, can you tell us
where the chase started?

01:31.759 --> 01:35.877
[Jeff] We’re hearing reports that the
pursuit began near the La Brea area,

01:35.972 --> 01:39.385
then traveled through a warehouse
district south of the 10 freeway.

01:39.475 --> 01:42.091
[woman] Can you see how many people
are in the car?

01:42.186 --> 01:44.051
[Jeff] It appears to be just the driver.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.478
We’re not sure if that's
the owner of the car.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.352
What you’re seeing here
are pictures of the 10 freeway

01:49.443 --> 01:52.276
- south of downtown.
- [woman] Is that a Camaro, Jeff?

01:52.363 --> 01:55.901
[Jeff] Yes, it looks like a vintage
ear/y ’703 model.

01:55.992 --> 01:56.947
Damn it.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.195
[sirens]

02:05.376 --> 02:08.163
[tires screech]

02:17.513 --> 02:19.219
Show us your hands!

02:20.725 --> 02:22.261
[police radio chatter]

02:22.351 --> 02:24.137
[helicopter]

02:24.228 --> 02:25.809
[panting]

02:25.896 --> 02:29.024
Roll down the window
and show us your hands now!

02:39.160 --> 02:41.367
Slowly open the door
with your left hand.

02:49.045 --> 02:50.080
Get out of the car!

02:51.589 --> 02:53.420
Turn around, slow.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.603
On the ground!

03:10.900 --> 03:11.935
Now!

03:18.616 --> 03:20.231
Stop! Don't you know who I am?

03:20.326 --> 03:24.410
Stop, wait! Don't you know who I am?
I'm one of the Oceanic Six!

03:25.623 --> 03:27.409
I'm one of the Oceanic Six!

03:43.933 --> 03:46.766
[man] So five minutes
before you led ten cruisers

03:46.852 --> 03:48.638
on a chase across the city,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.937
you're minding your own business
in a convenience store?

03:52.650 --> 03:56.142
Until you see something and freak out.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.319
Mr. Reyes, why did you run like that?

03:59.407 --> 04:01.898
Who'd you see in there?

04:02.952 --> 04:05.739
Listen, buddy, I know you saw
somebody in that store

04:05.830 --> 04:09.072
- that made you run away...
- Wasn't running away from anyone.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.908
Do you think I care
that you're a celebrity?

04:12.002 --> 04:14.994
You crashed your Camaro
in the wrong neighborhood.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.330
- I'm not a celebrity.
- [scoffs]

04:18.259 --> 04:21.501
Is that why you kept shouting,
"Hey, I'm one of the Oceanic Six"?

04:22.847 --> 04:25.338
You want to know a funny coincidence?

04:26.016 --> 04:27.005
Sure.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.092
I knew somebody on your plane.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.974
Really?

04:34.316 --> 04:36.568
Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez.

04:37.278 --> 04:40.395
She was my partner
before I made detective.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.231
Dark hair.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.316
Gorgeous.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.570
Maybe you knew her.

04:52.042 --> 04:56.001
Maybe met her on the plane,
before it took off?

04:58.007 --> 04:59.622
Sorry, never met her.

05:05.723 --> 05:08.385
Why don't you watch the tape?

05:09.018 --> 05:10.929
Maybe it'll spark something.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.969
I'm gonna get a doughnut.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.474
You want one?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.732
- No, thanks.
- When I come back,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.151
you're gonna tell me who you ran from.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.558
Hey!

05:53.646 --> 05:54.931
Help!

05:56.982 --> 05:58.518
Help!

05:58.609 --> 06:00.975
Help! Help me, help!

06:01.445 --> 06:03.811
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:03.906 --> 06:06.363
What are you doing, Reyes?

06:06.450 --> 06:08.782
You trying to get tossed
into the nuthouse?

06:08.869 --> 06:12.361
Because if that's what you want I can
make that happen right now, my friend.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.866
You can?

06:14.416 --> 06:15.997
Oh, thank you.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.792
Thank you, thank you.

06:20.965 --> 06:24.583
Jack, you there, dude?
Beach to Jack. Come in, Jack.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.218
- Beach to Jack.
- Right here, Hurley. What's up?

06:28.305 --> 06:31.797
Hey, did you guys make it
to that radio tower thingy yet?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.383
Yeah. And I talked to the people
on the boat.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.764
They're on their way
to pick us up right now.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.141
Seriously? It worked?

06:39.233 --> 06:42.396
Seriously. We're all on the way
back to the beach right now,

06:42.486 --> 06:44.693
so you better pack your bags, buddy.

06:44.780 --> 06:48.398
[laughing] Dude, that's great!

06:48.492 --> 06:50.278
Whoo-hoo!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.582
- Any luck?
- Nothing, no sign of him.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.580
It's like he just disappeared.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.579
Why would Locke kill her?

07:03.674 --> 07:05.915
- He hadn't met her.
- Because he's crazy.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.841
So, what if he comes back?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.465
He comes back, I'm gonna kill him.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.260
I'm gonna get everybody together.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.607
Sooner we get back
to the beach the better.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.484
Are we really going home?

07:27.823 --> 07:29.529
Yeah, we're really going home.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.530
- [Aaron cries]
- [Sun laughs]

07:38.626 --> 07:42.619
I can't believe I'm actually going
to have my baby in a hospital.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.453
Oh, rub it in, why don't you?

07:44.548 --> 07:47.290
- Oh, no...
- You ladies need a hand?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.841
No, we're just
wrapping things up, thanks.

07:51.055 --> 07:55.640
You must be very proud of Bernard.
I hear he's quite the hero.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.809
Everyone up here knows
the real hero is your man, Claire.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.558
If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo

08:01.649 --> 08:04.891
we'd still be getting a busy signal
on that fancy phone.

08:06.403 --> 08:10.817
So you better make sure you treat him
real good when we get back.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.899
- Rose!
- [Rose chuckles]

08:16.080 --> 08:17.695
OK, thanks, I have enough.

08:17.790 --> 08:20.327
I need you to do me a favor.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.332
I need you to take Alex and
get as far from here as possible.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.503
What?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.582
Listen to me,
we don't have time for this.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.840
Everyone who stays here is going to die.

08:32.930 --> 08:35.797
Now get Alex and get away right now.

08:35.891 --> 08:38.177
I don't care where you go, just go.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.884
I will not have my daughter...

08:43.357 --> 08:45.723
She's not your daughter.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.126
Did I ever tell you lwon the lottery?

09:08.257 --> 09:13.001
I got, like, $150 million.
Worst thing that ever happened to me.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.552
Oh, yeah, who needs $150 million?

09:15.639 --> 09:19.427
Now it'll all be gone
'cause they all think I'm dead.

09:20.269 --> 09:23.261
When we get rescued and | go back...

09:24.523 --> 09:26.104
...l'm gonna be free.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.898
I want to do a cannonball.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.987
I've been walking up and down
this beach every day

09:38.078 --> 09:41.616
and looking out at this water,
and I want to do a cannonball.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.041
Hurley, you want to do a cannonball?

09:46.670 --> 09:47.910
Cannonball.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.672
We need to get to Jack. We can't
let him get in touch with that boat.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.721
Easy, Scotty, everything's cool.
The boat's on the way.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.469
What? On the way? No.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.766
- Where's Charlie?
- That woman Naomi lied.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.390
The people on the boat
aren't who they say they are!

10:47.481 --> 10:49.437
- Then who are they?
- Where's Charlie?

10:49.525 --> 10:51.982
I don't know, but we need
to get in touch with Jack now!

10:52.069 --> 10:54.481
- We can call him, we have a walkie.
- Get it!

10:54.571 --> 10:57.608
- What do you mean people aren't who...?
- Where's Charlie?!

11:04.039 --> 11:06.951
I'm... I'm sorry, brother. I...

11:27.437 --> 11:29.177
[sat-phone rings]

11:31.775 --> 11:33.185
That's our ride.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.696
- Hello?
- [man] Hey, Jack.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.238
This is George Minkowski. We’re
trying to get a lock on your signal,

11:40.325 --> 11:42.407
but we’re getting some RF interference.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.531
We’re gonna need to rejigger
some settings on your sat-phone.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.829
Uh, sure. OK,
just tell me what I gotta do.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.907
How about you put Naomi on?

11:50.794 --> 11:53.206
Naomi went to get some firewood.

11:53.297 --> 11:56.084
Can you hold on for a second?
Let me see if I can...

12:10.022 --> 12:11.307
Where is she?

12:14.151 --> 12:15.766
[mutters]

12:21.241 --> 12:22.526
We gotta call the doc.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.034
Did you listen to Desmond?
Charlie wrote on his hand...

12:26.121 --> 12:28.112
Look, I'm sorry he's dead.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.663
But, I don't even know what
"not Penny's boat" means.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.743
- Calling Jack accomplishes nothing.
- It would warn him.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.079
It also warns the people on
the freighter we're suspicious of them.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.540
They're monitoring our communications.
If we call...

12:39.635 --> 12:42.172
You know what?
I got the walkie, I'm making the call.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.843
Hey! Give...

12:49.144 --> 12:51.135
We better get going.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.190
Going where?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.694
I found blood. The girl's trail.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.071
Probably crawled away.

13:07.162 --> 13:11.155
Can't be more than ten minutes ahead
of us. We should go, now, and find her.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.908
- We're taking him with us.
- And why would we do that?

13:15.003 --> 13:17.619
Because I don't trust him
with anybody but me.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.208
All right, listen up.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.634
I need all of you
to head back to the beach.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.097
When these people show up,

13:26.181 --> 13:29.423
we want to make sure
we're real easy for them to find, OK?

13:29.518 --> 13:31.725
- Yeah.
- You look worried, Jack.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.314
The only thing I'm worried about
is missing our ride home.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.773
I found her trail. She's headed west
across the island.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.652
Rousseau already found it.
We're going after her now.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.826
But... Are you sure it's hers?

13:53.917 --> 13:55.953
Unless someone else is bleeding.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.133
- I think we should follow both...
- Kate.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.004
Six hours from now,
we're gonna be sitting on that boat,

14:05.095 --> 14:09.259
laughing about the fact there was
one final thing we couldn't agree upon.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.018
Naomi is hurt. She ran into the jungle.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.593
She's not thinking about
leaving fake trails.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.355
- You're right.
- l'll track her down.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.728
Why don't you get everybody
back to the beach?

14:20.819 --> 14:23.356
- You got it.
- [sighs]

14:30.912 --> 14:32.288
Be careful, OK?

14:32.956 --> 14:33.945
Yeah.

14:45.886 --> 14:49.674
What the hell's gotten into you, Hugo?
They'll all be back in the morning.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.097
- We just wait.
- You don't wait with warnings.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.299
You warn.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.859
Here l was thinking I was gonna get
a good night's sleep.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.583
You almost got me that time.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.582
How about best out of seven?

15:24.549 --> 15:26.665
Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?

15:28.345 --> 15:30.552
By the way, you have a visitor.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.897
Mr. Reyes.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.059
Hello.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.362
My name is Matthew Abbadon.
I'm an attorney for Oceanic Airlines.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.774
Can we talk for a few minutes?

15:55.330 --> 15:56.661
OK.

16:01.211 --> 16:06.251
I'm here, Mr. Reyes, 'cause we heard
about your recent... episode.

16:06.925 --> 16:10.008
Your arrest, your incarceration here.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.678
Frankly, we feel terrible about it.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.299
So, on behalf of Oceanic,

16:17.394 --> 16:20.477
I'd like to extend you an invitation
for a little upgrade.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.226
What kind of upgrade?

16:26.236 --> 16:29.399
To a facility where the paint
isn't peeling off the walls.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.653
Where you'd have your own bathroom.
You can see the ocean...

16:33.743 --> 16:35.529
I don't want to see the ocean.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.657
No problem.

16:41.626 --> 16:45.414
Actually, thanks. I'm fine right here.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.672
Are you fine, Mr. Reyes?

16:50.844 --> 16:51.924
What do you mean?

16:52.637 --> 16:54.298
You're in a mental institution.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.302
Who'd you say you were again?

16:59.394 --> 17:01.851
I'd like to see a business card.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.934
I must have left them at home.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.984
Then we're done, dude.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.240
Are they still alive?

17:19.748 --> 17:21.079
What?

17:22.334 --> 17:23.494
You heard me.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.705
Nurse! Nurse!

17:26.796 --> 17:28.923
Get out of here!
You better get out of here!

17:29.007 --> 17:31.248
Help me! He's after me!
No,no,no!

17:31.343 --> 17:33.629
- That guy's after me. Help me.
- OK, OK.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.937
All right there, Hugo?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.818
Yeah, dude, I'm fine.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.909
- You want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?

17:59.996 --> 18:01.452
Charlie.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.795
I mean, you two were buddies.
| just thought...

18:12.175 --> 18:15.167
We'll probably get to Jack faster
if we don't talk.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.934
I'm gonna head up
and tell them to slow down.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.307
- I can keep up.
- All right, ese.

18:27.399 --> 18:30.812
Just... holler if you need me.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.098
Guys!

19:04.769 --> 19:06.100
Guys!

19:07.355 --> 19:08.686
Guys!

19:13.445 --> 19:14.685
Guys!

19:20.410 --> 19:21.741
Guys!

19:22.704 --> 19:25.411
[wind howling]

19:28.043 --> 19:31.160
[voices whispering]

19:37.302 --> 19:39.133
Uh-oh.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.427
The blood trail ends here.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.386
What do you mean?

19:51.691 --> 19:52.680
It ends.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.233
Are you telling me
she stopped bleeding here?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.608
No. I'm telling you she fooled us
and doubled back.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.564
Better call the boat,

20:00.658 --> 20:03.866
tell them she's getting
a really big bundle of firewood.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.709
Where is it?

20:13.797 --> 20:16.539
OK, I probably should've told you
I saw her take the phone,

20:16.633 --> 20:18.464
but you'd beat me up, Jack.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.710
- I owed you one.
- What are you talking about?

20:21.805 --> 20:24.091
Kate took it when she hugged you.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.935
She found the right trail, too.
You wouldn't listen to her.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.512
So, I guess she's taken matters
into her own hands.

20:32.607 --> 20:36.395
But, look on the bright side, somebody
around here knows what they're doing.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.466
[sat-phone rings]

21:16.734 --> 21:18.816
- Hello?
- [George] Who’s this?

21:20.822 --> 21:23.108
- Uh, his is Kate.
- You with Jack?

21:23.199 --> 21:26.407
- No, he's not here.
- Where’s Naomi?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.077
We're looking for her.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.451
What do you mean,
you’re looking for her?

21:37.172 --> 21:38.787
[gasps]

21:40.842 --> 21:42.457
[grunting, groaning]

21:44.971 --> 21:46.086
Give me the phone.

21:48.558 --> 21:51.220
- Give me the phone.
- Naomi, listen to me.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.223
- You're hurt, let me help you.
- Help me?

21:54.314 --> 21:58.353
| just spent the last three days
trying to get you people rescued,

21:58.443 --> 22:00.479
and you throw this knife in my back.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.435
No, no. That was not us.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.188
- Who?
- His name is John Locke.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.654
- Why?
- He said you weren't who you said.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.906
[sat-phone rings]

22:10.997 --> 22:14.160
I swear to God we would
never hurt you. You know us.

22:14.918 --> 22:17.375
Please. We need your help.
Please help us.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.453
Give me the phone.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.711
George, it's Naomi.

22:27.805 --> 22:31.343
Naomi, where have you been?
What’s going on over there?

22:34.103 --> 22:37.470
I had an accident. l'm hurt.

22:37.565 --> 22:41.149
An accident? What accident?
What happened?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.818
Naomi.

22:44.781 --> 22:45.770
Hello?

22:46.282 --> 22:48.944
- Hello.
- I hit a tree branch...

22:49.786 --> 22:51.447
...when l parachuted in.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.369
Took it through my gut.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.822
Why did they tell me
you were getting ﬁrewood?

22:55.917 --> 22:59.626
I guess they were afraid to tell you
what happened till I could talk to you.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.704
We ’ve lost our signal,
and we can't come get you.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.960
Can you change
your tracking frequency?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.552
Yeah.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.721
Try it now.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.848
Clear as a bell.

23:13.935 --> 23:17.723
Hang on, Naomi, we’ll get you
back here ASAP, OK?

23:17.814 --> 23:20.021
I'm sorry, George.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.608
Just tell my sister that I love her.

23:25.655 --> 23:26.690
[phone beeps]

23:34.163 --> 23:35.323
Hello?

24:02.525 --> 24:04.937
[creaking]

24:16.664 --> 24:18.165
[panting]

24:19.792 --> 24:20.998
Help!

24:21.711 --> 24:23.542
Help!

24:23.630 --> 24:24.915
Help!

24:40.271 --> 24:41.886
There's nothing here.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.391
There's nothing here.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.144
There's nothing here.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.940
There's nothing here!

24:56.245 --> 24:58.577
[screams]

25:00.041 --> 25:01.497
Hello, Hugo.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.540
You've got yourself
good and lost out here, Hugo.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.541
How did you get separated
from the group?

25:15.306 --> 25:16.421
| just...

25:18.309 --> 25:19.845
...fell behind, I guess.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.598
Is that why you were shouting for help?

25:22.689 --> 25:24.350
I got scared.

25:28.236 --> 25:31.194
What Desmond said happened
down in that station,

25:31.989 --> 25:34.196
"Not Penny's boat."

25:34.784 --> 25:37.526
Are you sure that's what
Charlie wrote on his hand?

25:38.121 --> 25:40.362
Jack should never have called
those people.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.321
I couldn't agree more.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.244
It's gonna be hard
to talk him into thinking

25:47.338 --> 25:49.203
they're not coming here to rescue us.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.461
Well, guess we're gonna have
to try our best, Hugo...

25:53.636 --> 25:56.423
...because if we can't talk him
out of it...

25:58.349 --> 26:00.260
...then Charlie died for nothing.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.362
Where the hell have you been,
Hugo?

26:18.453 --> 26:22.571
Sorry. lwasjust, uh... I got lost.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.584
[Sawyer sighs]

26:28.671 --> 26:30.457
What are you doing here?

26:31.841 --> 26:34.082
I came here
for the same reason you did,

26:34.177 --> 26:36.418
to warn Jack about the people
on that boat.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.922
I already gave it a shot,

26:38.014 --> 26:41.632
but... lfigured I might have
better luck with some support.

26:42.393 --> 26:43.849
You want my support?

26:43.936 --> 26:46.769
You can tell me why you destroyed
that submarine.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.144
[guns cock]

26:58.701 --> 27:00.282
[Sun calls to Jin]

27:21.557 --> 27:22.546
[sighs]

27:24.060 --> 27:25.800
Still in one piece.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.476
- Rambo.
- Ow.

Uaughs]

27:28.648 --> 27:30.513
[chatter]

27:40.785 --> 27:42.195
I'll tell her.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.827
[Aaron cries]

28:06.686 --> 28:08.222
He's dead.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.765
Charlie's dead.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.108
No.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.822
[sobs]

28:39.510 --> 28:41.501
I'd watch out if I were you.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.044
What are you talking about, dude?

28:44.140 --> 28:47.303
There's a guy over there,
staring at you.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.476
- What guy?
- That guy.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.064
Hey, man.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.225
Don't run.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.858
Hurley, just...

29:01.949 --> 29:03.485
Just...

29:04.201 --> 29:05.407
Sit down.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.156
I want to talk to you.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.660
Come on.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.754
Don't do what you did in the store, OK?

29:17.006 --> 29:20.339
There's no need to... freak out.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.759
No need to freak out? I'm trying
to buy some jerky and a Slushee,

29:23.846 --> 29:26.258
and suddenly you're
standing over by the Ho Hos.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.431
You're dead.
What do you expect me to do?

29:29.185 --> 29:31.551
Can we just... sit down?

29:32.688 --> 29:35.430
I may be in the mental hospital,
but I know you're dead,

29:35.524 --> 29:38.652
and I'm not having an imaginary
conversation with you.

29:39.904 --> 29:40.939
I am dead.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.695
But I'm also here.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.535
OK, prove it.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.212
OK, OK.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.721
Did you know you were going to die
when you swam out there?

30:21.946 --> 30:23.482
Why didn't you tell me?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.063
Because you would've tried to stop me.

30:27.368 --> 30:31.077
And since I was gonna do it anyway
I thought to spare you all the drama.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.241
And now you have to do something...

30:37.712 --> 30:39.498
...but you're hiding from it.

30:41.048 --> 30:44.666
That's the real reason you ran
when you saw me in the store.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.218
- You knew I was here to tell you.
- I'm not listening to this.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.258
No, 'cause you're not here.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.135
I am here. You're being a baby.

30:52.226 --> 30:54.512
I'm gonna close my eyes,
and count to five.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.855
- When I open them, you'll be gone.
- I am here.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.804
- One... two...
- Don't do this.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.514
- They need you.
- ...three...

31:00.609 --> 31:02.145
- They need you.
- ...four...

31:02.236 --> 31:04.101
- You know they need you.
- ...five!

31:20.337 --> 31:23.079
When? What happened?

31:25.926 --> 31:28.542
I mean, how did he...?

31:31.015 --> 31:33.597
He was trying to help us.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.241
[grunts]

31:55.498 --> 31:58.706
[groans, panting]

32:05.174 --> 32:06.505
[gun cocks]

32:09.553 --> 32:10.633
Jack.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.220
You're not gonna shoot me, Jack...

32:18.395 --> 32:21.011
- ...any more than I was gonna shoot...
- [gun clicks]

32:24.819 --> 32:26.434
It's not loaded.

32:33.536 --> 32:35.948
- Come on, Jack.
- Let go of me!

32:39.333 --> 32:41.790
- Do you know what he did?
- Yes, I know what he did!

32:41.877 --> 32:43.378
[Locke] All I did...

32:44.547 --> 32:47.038
All l have ever done...

32:47.675 --> 32:49.916
...has been in the best interest
of all of us.

32:50.010 --> 32:51.546
Are you insane?

32:56.058 --> 32:58.640
I know,
I have a lot of explaining to do,

32:58.727 --> 33:03.016
but I never did anything
to hurt any of you.

33:03.107 --> 33:06.520
I even risked my life to tell you
that there was a traitor in your midst.

33:06.610 --> 33:07.725
She helped us, John.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.732
All you ever did was blow up
every chance we had

33:10.823 --> 33:12.654
of getting off this island.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.322
You killed Naomi!

33:14.410 --> 33:17.322
Well, technically,
he didn't kill her yet.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.199
[Kate] Yes, he did.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.624
She just died.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.293
She didn't give you up, John.

33:26.380 --> 33:29.964
She covered for us, and she fixed this.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.381
They're on their way.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.131
She didn't cover for anyone.

33:35.222 --> 33:38.680
She wants her people to come here.

33:39.226 --> 33:42.343
And trust me, when they do,
we had better be far away from here.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.646
I'm going to the barracks.
The Others abandoned them.

33:46.734 --> 33:49.601
It's the only place on the island
with any form of security.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.107
lt'll have to do until
I think of something else.

33:53.282 --> 33:55.739
Until then, if you want to live...

33:56.619 --> 33:58.075
...you need to come with me.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.870
No one's going anywhere
with you, John,

34:01.957 --> 34:04.619
- because they're not crazy.
- He's not crazy.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.868
What about Charlie?

34:10.966 --> 34:14.754
Charlie went down to that place
so we could all be rescued.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.805
And whatever he did down there,
it worked.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.394
But then something
must have happened...

34:31.695 --> 34:34.152
...must've heard something before he...

34:39.370 --> 34:42.737
I don't know why,
but he changed his mind.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.629
Because the last thing he did
was to warn us

34:52.716 --> 34:55.708
that the people on that boat
are not who they said they were.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.879
[mouths] Not Penny's boat.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.645
So I'm not listening to you.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.739
I'm listening to my friend.

35:22.496 --> 35:24.202
I'm listening to Charlie.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.138
Anyone else?

35:44.226 --> 35:45.762
There isn't much time.

36:00.576 --> 36:03.739
Jack, with your permission,
I'd like to go with John.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.751
He's all yours.

36:19.595 --> 36:22.086
[quiet chatter]

36:25.601 --> 36:27.512
You said we'd never leave the island.

36:27.603 --> 36:31.516
If you want to go with Locke,
I'll be right behind you.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.394
I'm not going anywhere with that man.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.451
What are you doing?

36:52.127 --> 36:54.709
Same thing I've always done, Kate.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.170
Surviving.

37:02.304 --> 37:06.297
ﬁhundeﬂ

37:18.445 --> 37:21.312
You know where to find us
when you change your mind.

38:07.703 --> 38:08.943
You ever miss?

38:13.625 --> 38:14.614
Jack.

38:15.335 --> 38:19.749
Yeah. I was on my way back
from a consult.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.001
Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit.

38:24.553 --> 38:25.793
Horse?

38:25.888 --> 38:27.298
You're on.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.802
So consult, huh?

38:30.893 --> 38:33.805
Does that mean you're back
doing surgical stuff?

38:33.896 --> 38:34.931
Yeah.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.101
H.

38:43.197 --> 38:44.983
[Hugo] Reporters leaving you alone?

38:48.744 --> 38:49.733
Yeah.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.820
Still have to sign some autographs
when | go out for coffee.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.202
Thinking about growing a beard.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.370
You'd look weird with a beard, dude.

39:02.799 --> 39:03.788
That's H-O.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.754
So...

39:09.223 --> 39:11.384
...what are you really doing here, Jack?

39:15.979 --> 39:19.267
l was just checking on you,
seeing if everything was OK.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.524
You're checking to see if I went nuts,

39:22.611 --> 39:24.693
if I was gonna tell.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.113
Are you?

39:33.080 --> 39:34.286
You're up.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.325
No, you win. I...

39:42.089 --> 39:43.579
I gotta run.

39:46.093 --> 39:47.754
It was great seeing you, Hurley.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.807
I'm sorry.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.811
I'm sorry I went with Locke.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.729
I should've stayed with you.

40:10.701 --> 40:12.817
lt's water under the bridge, man.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.120
I don't think we did
the right thing, Jack.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.620
- I think it wants us to come back.
- Hurley.

40:24.715 --> 40:27.707
- It's gonna do everything it...
- We're never going back!

40:38.604 --> 40:40.265
Never say never, dude.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.085
Are you thinking of Charlie?

41:07.466 --> 41:10.458
Feels like a hundred years ago
we came out here together.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.086
How did this happen?

41:15.182 --> 41:17.218
ﬁhundeﬂ

41:24.232 --> 41:27.065
Thunder's getting louder.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.768
[helicopter whirring]

41:31.448 --> 41:33.063
That's not thunder.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.659
Come on.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.452
Come on.

42:13.115 --> 42:14.525
Are you Jack?
