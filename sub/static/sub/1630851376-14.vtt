00:02.821 --> 00:04.684
After Denise's
bombshell announcement

00:04.784 --> 00:06.687
on Valentine's Day that
she wanted to get pregnant,

00:06.787 --> 00:08.930
everyone in the family
was excited about the idea.

00:09.030 --> 00:11.173
- Aww, they look like
little train conductors.

00:11.273 --> 00:12.294
Choo-choo!

00:12.394 --> 00:14.137
- Everyone except Sarah.

00:14.237 --> 00:16.921
- All aboard the train to baby
town, population: us.

00:17.281 --> 00:18.823
Woo!

00:18.923 --> 00:20.465
- I'll start saving
these outfits for you.

00:20.565 --> 00:21.947
You'll have
an extra pair of everything.

00:22.047 --> 00:23.830
- Yeah, unless you have twins.
[laughs]

00:23.930 --> 00:25.933
Do not have twins.

00:26.734 --> 00:28.036
- I'm sending this to Jojo.

00:28.136 --> 00:29.157
- How's her work trip?

00:29.257 --> 00:30.319
- Great.
Yeah, yeah,

00:30.419 --> 00:31.961
she's like live streaming

00:32.061 --> 00:34.565

sponsored by Lunchables.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.287
Yeah, it was a huge get.

00:36.387 --> 00:38.129
- Oh, I've always
wanted to see one of those.

00:38.229 --> 00:39.852
We should make a list of things
to do before the baby.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.254
- Yeah, like a bucket list.

00:41.354 --> 00:42.856
- We're not dying.
- Oh, right.

00:42.956 --> 00:45.079
No, of course,
nothing like that.

00:45.439 --> 00:49.024
Okay, let's go back to Mommy.
Yeah, here we go.

00:49.124 --> 00:51.127
Good job.

00:51.928 --> 00:55.313
- Hey, you know
those baby on board signs?

00:55.413 --> 00:56.955
- Yeah.
- I'm starting to get the vibe

00:57.055 --> 00:59.799
you're not on board with baby.
- Is it obvious?

00:59.899 --> 01:02.042
I've been fake smiling so much
my face hurts.

01:02.142 --> 01:05.767
- Don't worry, as a writer
I'm more perceptive than most.

01:05.867 --> 01:09.292
It's a gift, but...
it's also very much a curse.

01:09.392 --> 01:11.775
- Well, I never thought that we
would have more kids, you know?

01:11.875 --> 01:13.137
I thought we were good.

01:13.237 --> 01:15.420
But Denise is so excited.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.702
How do you tell
the woman that you love

01:16.802 --> 01:18.224
that she shouldn't have a baby?

01:18.324 --> 01:19.706
I was just
really looking forward

01:19.806 --> 01:21.348
to having some
more time on our hands.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.529
You know,
Kelvin and Shamiah are finally

01:22.609 --> 01:24.112
a little more independent,

01:24.212 --> 01:25.594
and we can
actually go out and do stuff.

- You're preaching
to the choir.

01:27.456 --> 01:29.038
After Marina's pregnancy scare,
I immediately signed up
