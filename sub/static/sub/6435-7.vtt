(knocking on door)

00:06.272 --> 00:07.539
(toilet flushes)

00:09.175 --> 00:12.344
Oh, excuse me, um,
are you the landlord here?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.947
VIC: Uh, yes. Victor Hargrove
at your service.
(humming)

00:14.949 --> 00:17.116
What can I do for you?
I'm looking for a man.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.817
Well, you ain't got
to look no further.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.652
(laughing):
Aren't you cute.

00:20.654 --> 00:24.723
(humming happily)
Well, no, actually, um,
this may sound strange,

00:24.725 --> 00:26.225
but I'm looking
for a homeless man.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.795
He's about 60, so tall,
um, he's usually intoxicated,

00:29.797 --> 00:31.630
and his name is...
Lloyd.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.165
(gasps)
Yes, Lloyd.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.167
Ah, I'm so relieved.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.468
Is he here?

00:36.470 --> 00:37.703
VIC:
How you know Lloyd?
(gasps)

00:37.705 --> 00:38.804
WOMAN:
He's my husband.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.140
I mean... I mean,
my ex-husband.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.642
No, actually...
it's just a little complicated.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.978
You and Lloyd?

00:45.980 --> 00:47.546
Lloyd and you?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.148
I'm so relieved
that he's... Is he here?

00:49.150 --> 00:50.315
Uh, you know what?

00:50.317 --> 00:52.317
Come on in and
have a seat.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.787
Oh, okay, thank you.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.992
Lloyd!

01:01.394 --> 01:04.396
Lloyd! Lloyd!

01:04.398 --> 01:05.731
Vic.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.232
Listen to me carefully.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.701
I want you to go in there,
tell that woman that I'm dead.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.204
VIC: Lloyd, is that
really your wife?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.572
Ex-wife.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.575
Lloyd, the woman
is beautiful, man.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.843
Would you help me out?

01:17.845 --> 01:19.912
Tell her I got killed
in a carjacking.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.448
Tell her that Suge Knight
rolled over my face.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.183
Anything.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.884
WOMAN: Lloyd,
are you in there?

01:25.886 --> 01:27.419
Lloyd, please, just
give me five minutes.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.554
Lloyd is not here!

01:28.556 --> 01:30.889
Lloyd, I can hear you.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.891
Come on, man, you're
being ridiculous.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.626
Come out here and talk
to this woman, Lloyd.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.196
Oh, God, my God, Lloyd!

01:37.198 --> 01:38.864
(Lloyd grunting)

01:38.866 --> 01:40.866
(grunts)
All right, all right.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.734
Stop slobbering
on me, woman.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.337
Oh! (giggles)

02:15.802 --> 02:17.836
Lloyd, you look amazing.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.671
How did you find me, anyway?

02:19.673 --> 02:21.006
Well, I was asking around,

02:21.008 --> 02:23.609
and this guy with a
bad wig and robes on

02:23.611 --> 02:25.477
told me that you
lived here now.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.979
Oh, damn you, Jesus.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.314
All the shit that I ask for,
and this is what you give me.

02:29.316 --> 02:33.085
VIC: Guess I'll, uh, leave and
let you guys work things out.

02:33.087 --> 02:36.155
No, no, no, no, no,
Vic is my boss, my bestie.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.257
Anything you want to say to me,
you can say to Vic.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.258
Okay.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.026
I want you back, Lloyd.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.095
I've been waiting for you
to get your life together,

02:43.097 --> 02:44.163
and you have.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.598
And I am so
proud of you.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.401
No. Now, if you
will excuse me...

02:50.637 --> 02:51.770
VIC: Hey, wait
a minute, Lloyd.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.205
Uh, maybe you should listen

02:53.207 --> 02:54.773
to hear what
the woman got to say.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.341
Before you leave.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.676
Vic, stay out of this.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.011
I need some air.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.181
Whew!

03:02.183 --> 03:04.383
And some Darby.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.617
You need a bath, nigga.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.618
(door slams)

03:06.620 --> 03:07.786
(scoffs)

03:07.788 --> 03:09.121
Maybe I shouldn't
have come.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.455
I still can't
believe it.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.490
You and Lloyd?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.691
Come on, Lloyd?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.359
Well, I'm staying
downtown.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.296
Can I give you my phone number,
in case he changes his mind?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.797
You know what, I'll do you
one better than that.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.499
Why don't you stay for a minute?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.701
'Cause, you never know,
he might come right back.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.336
(chuckles)

03:24.338 --> 03:26.538
TRAYVON: Okay, cheat out to me,
I can't really see your face.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.539
There you go.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.575
(rap music plays)

03:29.577 --> 03:32.010
You know what, playback's
actually messing me up.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.812
Let me turn that off.
There we go.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.181
Man, what you doing, man?
That's banging, baby.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.150
I can't stop banging to that,
baby, you know what I'm saying?

03:38.152 --> 03:39.851
I know, that-that's why--
you don't stop banging,

03:39.853 --> 03:41.486
and that's why I had to
cut it off, all right?

03:41.488 --> 03:43.088
Less grooving, more stirring.
Let's-let's get this, okay?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.089
You don't even know
how to rock shit.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.524
You're from the suburbs, fool.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.925
I Googled it-- I know
exactly what I'm doing.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.694
Hey, man, let me
tell you something, man.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.362
Don't disrespect me, man.
Don't put your...
I'm not disrespecting.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.164
Get your finger out of my face.
Don't disrespect me.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.398
You're my friend, man.
Move your finger outta my face!

03:53.400 --> 03:54.833
Don't disrespect me, man.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.201
JESUS: Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm doing anything
to disrespect you!

03:56.203 --> 03:57.402
JESUS: Cut that out,
cut that out, man.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.537
What's wrong with y'all?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.072
Hey, what's up, Jee?
Look, check it out.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.840
We here, we shooting

04:01.842 --> 04:03.575
You know, for my joint,

04:03.577 --> 04:05.677
Man, we on location

04:05.679 --> 04:07.512
Uh, we gonna be

04:07.514 --> 04:09.948
She gonna be gone all day,
so we gonna be all up

04:09.950 --> 04:11.750

shit up in there.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.085
You know
what I'm saying?

04:13.087 --> 04:14.453
It's gonna crack, right?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.221
(chuckling)
JESUS: Boonie.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.757
All that "bitchity-bitch-bitch"
and "ho, ho, ho" that.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.726
You can't keep
objectifying "womenses"

04:20.728 --> 04:22.461
and lady-girls like that, man.

04:22.463 --> 04:25.097
Everybody can't be Too Short
and Uncle Luke, man.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.633
Hey, man, what we trying to do
is make some legit money.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.534
Which was your idea,
by the way.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.902
And you ain't helping.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.304
TRAYVON: Look, if I
may interject, Jesus.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.605
Tell him the plan we have,
tell him the plan.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.873
Hey, check it out, Jee.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.074
We want you to be in
the video, right?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.276
Know what I'm sayin'?

04:37.278 --> 04:38.543
See, I'm-a get
in this shootout,

04:38.545 --> 04:40.279
and I'm-a be bustin' up
in them (bleep),

04:40.281 --> 04:42.881
and we want you to put your holy
hand in that ass. (laughs)

04:42.883 --> 04:44.716
Think-think like-like...

04:44.718 --> 04:46.551
like Jesus meets
Angel of Death, you know?

04:46.553 --> 04:48.320
BOONIE:
Yeah, man.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.656
That's some
dumb-ass shit, man.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.258
But check this out, y'all go
ahead and handle your business.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.460
'Cause you know what I'm saying,
I'm-a go do my thing.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.996
I got other stuff to do,
like God's work.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.199
You know, we out here helping
the less (bleep) fortunate.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.403
Trayvon.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.239
BOONIE: Hey, man, your face
too big for that hairdo anyway.

05:07.241 --> 05:09.474
Hey, man, I knew he wasn't
gonna do this shit, man.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.076
TRAYVON:
So what do we do?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.744
Act like he better
than us, man.
Hey, man, listen.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.012
We got bitches, right?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.081
"Ladies."
No, we don't have any.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.649
How we gonna do
a video called "Side Bitches"

05:17.651 --> 05:18.950
if we ain't got
no side bitches?

05:18.952 --> 05:21.486
No, I do not want to be
a skank in your video.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.155
Thanks for calling.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.589
BOONIE: Oh, no, Maggs,
it ain't like that.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.759
We got some other stuff
besides "degregation."

05:27.761 --> 05:28.860
Is that the word?
Mm-hmm.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.629
I'm not dressing
like a ho.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.431
Hey, mute it,
mute it, mute it.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.765
What?
Listen, man.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.835
Fully clothed bitches is better
than no bitches and no boot...

05:36.837 --> 05:38.370
The shit called
"Side Bitches."

05:38.372 --> 05:40.038
You're right.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.374
All right, Maggs, you ain't got
to dress all skanky,

05:42.376 --> 05:43.608
but, look, can you find some
bitches

05:43.610 --> 05:45.177
who will dress like hoes?

05:45.179 --> 05:46.845
So Jesus is doing
this with you?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.280
Yeah, Jesus gonna be there.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.382
So you're telling me
that if I bring my girlfriends,

05:50.384 --> 05:51.616
that they're gonna
get to meet Jesus?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.285
Yeah, of course.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.120
He's not gonna be there.
He is gonna be there.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.288
Man, I don't believe you.
Put Tray on the phone.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.723
Tell the bitch
that goddamn Jesus

05:57.725 --> 05:59.191
gonna be there, man.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.559
I told you-- I don't lie;
that's not what I do.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.561
Tray, we need... Tray!
(muffled talking)

06:02.563 --> 06:03.895
Okay, I, um...

06:03.897 --> 06:06.164
Hey, hey, Maggs,
it's Tray.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.833
Yeah, J-Jesus, he'll be here.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.035
Um, and he really wants you
and your friends to come.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.471
All right, he'd better be there.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.473
They'd better have Jesus Christ
there, you know what I'm saying?

06:14.475 --> 06:17.008
Because otherwise it's gonna
make me look stupid.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.010
I don't want
to look stupid.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.546
Not in front of my girls.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.116
Selfie.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.321
So do you work
out every day?

06:29.323 --> 06:31.323
Well, you know,
I try to get my Shaun T on

06:31.325 --> 06:32.491
at least twice a week...
Oh.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.161
Lloyd, we have to talk.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.195
Vic.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.164
Can I have a word
with you, please?

06:44.437 --> 06:46.671
What is she doing
here again today?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.006
She came back, man.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.508
She loves you.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.842
Y'all need to talk, man.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.010
Marriage is sacred.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.012
I want my old life back.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.681
You, me and Darby.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.384
We brought her here, and
we got to get her out.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.186
By "we," I mean you.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.954
Okay.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.856
That's what you really want?
Yes.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.358
All right.
Thank you.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.793
Good man, Vic.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.227
You take care of yourself.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.697
I'm gonna go across town,
running errands.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.566
And I'll be gone
about four or five hours.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.635
VIC: Hey, why don't you take
them cans with you, nigga.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.170
Yeah, all right.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.774
LLOYD:
Ooh, damn... (scoffs)

07:22.776 --> 07:25.644
I don't know why he
doesn't love me anymore.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.880
Maybe it's because I've
gotten so old and ugly.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.882
Oh, no, no, baby,
you got it all wrong.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.250
You ain't old and ugly.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.253
You got to realize that man
drink a lot of alcohol.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.823
(chuckles)
He can't see
what I can see.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.991
Mm.
Mmm...

07:43.796 --> 07:45.030
Mmm.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.313
♪ ♪

08:15.628 --> 08:17.295
TRAYVON: Maggs, thank
you so much for coming.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.297
Yo, yo, where's Jesus?
Um, he-he'll be here soon,

08:19.299 --> 08:20.932
but we got to get rolling,

08:20.934 --> 08:22.634
'cause we got a hard out by
the time Boonie's mom gets in.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.836
Hey, Boonie, my friends can
only stay for a couple hours,

08:24.838 --> 08:26.137
so they have to meet Jesus.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.472
Hey, Jee coming, you know?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.341
And thanks for bringing
the broads through.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.277
Hey, any of them down for some
casting couch action after this?

08:32.279 --> 08:34.613
They're here because
they came to meet Jesus.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.615
That's why we're doing
the video.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.283
Hey, Jee coming! Damn!

08:38.285 --> 08:39.818
Yeah, uh, he--
five minutes and...

08:39.820 --> 08:41.219
but we got to get
rolling, you know?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.554
BOONIE:
All right, so look,

08:42.556 --> 08:44.556
in this, you gonna
be my side bitch,

08:44.558 --> 08:46.791
looking out for my main bitch,
also looking out

08:46.793 --> 08:48.627
for the people you
know I deal drugs to.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.161
Which gonna be played
by my boy right here.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.496
(chuckling): You know
what I'm saying?

08:51.498 --> 08:53.498
So look, Maggs, you
gonna be on deck.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.233
And you gonna have assault
bitches watching your back.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.801
These bitches right here.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.203
You mean these "actresses" here?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.504
Yeah, the gun bitches.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.473
See, you gonna be
my main side bitch,

09:01.475 --> 09:03.475
it's just they gonna have your
back, looking out for you.

09:03.477 --> 09:07.512
Y'all gonna be dancing, looking
all sexy and shit. (chuckles)

09:07.514 --> 09:08.847
I think I get it.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.916
So I'm protecting you,
these girls are my assistants,

09:10.918 --> 09:13.518
I'm in charge of security
for a drug dealer,

09:13.520 --> 09:14.886
and somehow I dance
while doing this.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.022
Th-Th-There's a bit
more to it than that,

09:17.024 --> 09:18.023
but, yeah, pretty much.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.024
Somehow I doubt it.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.325
Where's Jesus?

09:22.161 --> 09:25.163
Hey, baby.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.032
You still here.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.767
So you kicking me out now?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.268
Oh, no, no, not "kicking out."

09:30.270 --> 09:32.170
I mean... I just thought
it would be kind of awkward

09:32.172 --> 09:33.738
if Lloyd was to come back,
you know?

09:34.707 --> 09:36.508
We made a big mistake.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.109
Aw, Vic.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.444
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.912
It wasn't that big of a deal.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.181
You're married;
it was adultery.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.183
We could burn
in Hell for this.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.085
Oh, Vic, relax.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.087
Lloyd's not really
my husband anymore.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.089
Hey, listen, Mama,
listen, hey...

09:51.091 --> 09:54.025
I actually just came back
to pick these papers up.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.393
These papers,
they're around here some...

09:55.395 --> 09:57.395
They're around here somewhere,
these papers.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.030
Oh, man-- here they go,
right here.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.098
Mm.
They're right here.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.132
Yeah, see,
got to pay the bills.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.101
(chuckles)

10:03.103 --> 10:05.437
I love a man who
pays his bills, Vic!

10:07.239 --> 10:08.740
JESUS: Vic,
what's up, playboy?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.442
Hey, what the hell
you doing here?

10:10.444 --> 10:13.111
Man, I just got back from
spreading the Good Word, man.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.246
I was thinking to myself--
I need to go by here

10:15.248 --> 10:16.581
and holla at the homie,
Vic, man,

10:16.583 --> 10:18.450
give him a little support
and reassurance

10:18.452 --> 10:20.118
in his time of...
temptation.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.220
Temptation?

10:22.222 --> 10:24.289
Who the hell told
you that, huh?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.224
You been spying on
me again, nigga?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.226
Vic, man, ain't nobody
in your business, man.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.995
But everybody
in the building has seen

10:29.997 --> 10:31.396
Lloyd's wife
coming and going.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.132
Man, she is some serious
cougar action right there

10:34.134 --> 10:35.934
with major cake, brah.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.136
But look here, man, you know my
father don't get down like that.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.571
You can't be coveting
that woman, man.

10:39.573 --> 10:41.906
You need to mind your business.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.476
And stop pretending you even
know who your father is.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.113
That's disrespectful, Vic.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.815
But you're still one
of my most "favoritest" folks.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.252
Okay, and playback!

Oh, no, we're actually
shooting a video, so...

11:26.953 --> 11:29.521

in the house, please!

11:29.523 --> 11:30.955
God!

11:30.957 --> 11:32.691
So you actually filming a video?

BOONIE: Hey, it's
for my joint,

11:35.996 --> 11:38.196
"Side Bitches."
We getting it in.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.330
Hi, Shalinka.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.465
Don't speak to me, Maggie.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.067
I don't like you.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.334
Please don't speak to me.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.335
Just being nice.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.870
If you want to be nice,

11:45.872 --> 11:47.138
flip your ass off the balcony.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.707
BOONIE: Let me tell
you something.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.009
First off all, Maggie,
that's the fake side bitch.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.079
And these are the real side
bitches right here and, uh,

11:54.081 --> 11:56.581
all this is just entertainment!
That's true...

11:56.583 --> 11:58.917
How come you ain't ask me
to be in it, then?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.385
I didn't know you wanted
to be in the video,

12:00.387 --> 12:01.986
'cause we needed
some bad bitches.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.888
I would, actually.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.157
I want to shoot guns
and be a bad bitch, too.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.659
I ain't doing nothin'.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.327
And I just got my weave done.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.595
I spent all this money
on this bomb weave,

12:10.597 --> 12:13.598
I want to show it off
to the world.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.667
I don't want to be
no side bitch, though.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.570
That's my baby daddy,
I'm gonna be the main bitch!

12:23.776 --> 12:26.845
(laughter and chatter inside,
TV plays indistinctly)

12:26.847 --> 12:28.847
(huffs)

12:28.849 --> 12:30.415
Damn.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.287
Lloyd, what's up?

12:36.289 --> 12:37.555
I'm waiting to come home, Vic.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.124
When's she gonna be gone?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.693
Um... I can't do
that for you, man.

12:41.695 --> 12:42.560
Why?

12:42.562 --> 12:44.963
Vic, you promised me this!

12:44.965 --> 12:47.365
Truth is, Bernadette
is special to me.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.800
But she's flirty.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.568
I've always had
this lingering suspicion

12:50.570 --> 12:52.036
that she was cheating on me.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.938
I was jealous all the time!

12:53.940 --> 12:55.073
I was obsessed.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.207
Then I got depressed

12:56.209 --> 12:57.275
and started drinking again.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.710
Had to let her go.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.812
You understand, don't you, Vic?

13:01.881 --> 13:03.381
Yeah, yeah.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.382
I'll go away.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.984
Give you all the time you need.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.820
Okay? Just call me when
you kick that bitch out.

13:10.322 --> 13:11.322
REV. CLEVELAND:
<i>Well, go ahead, son.</i>

13:11.324 --> 13:13.424
I ain't got all day.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.161
(clears his throat)
Well...

13:16.163 --> 13:18.830
uh, I broke
a commandment.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.567
Uh, I slept with
somebody's wife.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.136
And it wasn't just
anybody's wife.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.405
It was one of
my good friends.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.474
You know, um,
I didn't want to do it,

13:29.476 --> 13:31.576
but, you know,
his wife is beautiful.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.610
She was jumping all over me.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.145
She was throwing it at me.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.413
And she ran off on him.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.815
But she would
never do that to me,

13:36.817 --> 13:39.017
'cause, see,
'cause we are in love.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.085
(laughs)
Jesus Christ, son.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.754
Don't scare me like that.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.622
I thought you killed somebody.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.425
I was about to throw your ass
out of here and call the cops.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.626
So you got some (bleep)--
so what?

13:48.628 --> 13:49.794
That's what I've been wanting

13:49.796 --> 13:51.629
to ask you about,
you know, like,

13:51.631 --> 13:53.431
I've been hearing stuff, rumors.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.933
What, that I (bleep)
a lot of bitches?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.034
All kind of bitches.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.302
Put that on my résumé.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.670
Isn't that sin?

13:58.672 --> 13:59.604
Yeah.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.039
That's why I pay for my (bleep).

14:01.041 --> 14:03.775
Pay? Like, you mean tricking...?

14:03.777 --> 14:05.109
No!

14:05.111 --> 14:07.278
Well... (stammers)

14:07.280 --> 14:08.646
What I meant was

14:08.648 --> 14:10.615
I pay God for my (bleep).

14:10.617 --> 14:13.151
It's just like I tell
the congregation.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.353
God knows we gonna sin.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.455
All he wants is for you
to pay for your sins.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.958
So I pay $250 for some head.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.459
$500 for vaginal sex.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.794
And I throw in
an extra $250

14:22.796 --> 14:25.163
if I run it up the (bleep).

14:25.165 --> 14:26.397
(chuckles)
Wow.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.399
Um...
(clears his throat)

14:28.401 --> 14:31.402
Who do you pay?

14:31.404 --> 14:33.004
The church.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.372
Me, nigga.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.474
And that's exactly
who you gonna pay.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.409
So, pay up.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.644
Okay.
If you can't pay to play,

14:39.646 --> 14:41.579
you ain't got
no business up in there.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.348
You got a point, Reverend.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.384
Always... I gotta
pay to play.

14:49.421 --> 14:50.722
God bless you, son.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.925
Go forth and sin some more.
(laughing)

14:58.497 --> 15:00.665
Where's Jesus?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.100
Uh, ten minutes,
he'll be right here.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.401
Hey, Link, real quick, okay.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.669
So here's the thing--

15:04.671 --> 15:06.037
now, Jason, Boonie, you guys are

15:06.039 --> 15:08.006
gonna come from inside
to outside, okay?

15:08.008 --> 15:10.675
You're gonna be walking home
with the groceries, all right?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.710
You're gonna see a side
up top with a shotgun,

15:12.712 --> 15:14.245
but here's the thing--
you're packing heat, too.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.513
No problems, okay?
The ground bitches,

15:15.515 --> 15:17.181
I mean, the ground sides,

15:17.183 --> 15:18.716
they're gonna be controlling
the ground area.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.951
So you're gonna
drop your groceries,

15:19.953 --> 15:21.419
you're gonna fire back--
bam, bam!

15:21.421 --> 15:22.520
I'll add the gunshots in post.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.621
Everything will be perfect.

15:23.623 --> 15:24.722
All right, you even know

15:24.724 --> 15:25.757
how to work that thing?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.058
Yeah, yeah, um,
hey guys?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.526
We're rolling, okay?

15:28.528 --> 15:30.528
So, le-let's everyone get
to their first position.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.864
All right, here we go.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.600
And... action!

15:35.602 --> 15:37.101
(laughs)
That's perfect.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.469
All these bitches?
Come on!

15:38.471 --> 15:40.538
There we go.
Jason, Boonie,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.874
come outside,
there you go.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.542
Hey, Boonie, Jason,
these are gunshots!

15:44.544 --> 15:46.644
You have to dodge,
you have to dodge!

15:46.646 --> 15:48.546
Dodging!
There we go.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.048
There you go, Maggs.
And cut!

15:50.050 --> 15:51.316
We got it! Moving on.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.317
Good job.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.384
Tray!
Yeah?

15:53.386 --> 15:54.819
Come here.
Mm-hmm.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.055
I want to do it again.
Oh, we...

15:57.057 --> 15:58.289
I think I can do
that part better.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.058
Oh, it was actually
good right here.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.926
No it wasn't; I only killed
two of them bitches.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.429
I can get all of them,
especially the bitch up there.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.596
BOONIE:
Hey, this video ain't about you.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.898
You got this shit looking

16:06.900 --> 16:08.399
like a single mom's documentary.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.834
Listen, it's okay-- we'll do--

16:09.836 --> 16:10.969
we got time for one more, okay?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.170
Is that cool?
Okay. That's cool.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.404
All right, you guys...

16:13.406 --> 16:15.239
And I need to be
the one to say cut.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.574
Oh, you want to direct as well?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.743
Yeah, 'cause you okay,
but you not that good.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.578
Okay.
I done seen a lot of ways

16:20.580 --> 16:22.413

16:22.415 --> 16:24.582
TRAYVON:
I mean, I mean, we-we're,
it's a work in progress.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.519
Hey, baby!

16:28.521 --> 16:30.254
Look, babe, we gonna
have to come clean.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.923
Tell the truth.
Now, I mean, uh,

16:31.925 --> 16:33.992
that's only the way
we gonna ever have

16:33.994 --> 16:36.094
any chance to have
something meaningful.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.428
You really mean it, boo?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.630
Hey, look, Bernadette, I...

16:39.632 --> 16:41.299
I ain't no Tiger Woods
or anything.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.800
I'm a Christian.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.370
And I'm just saying, in
order for us to do this

16:45.372 --> 16:47.805
and not feel ashamed of
ourself, we gotta be honest.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.107
Okay.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.508
Right?
Yeah, yeah.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.377
You cool with that?
I'm cool with that.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.145
Good, 'cause Lloyd is
right outside the door.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.813
I'm getting ready to go
out to get him right now,

16:55.815 --> 16:56.814
tell him exactly
what's going on.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.216
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.951
Don't do that.
Not now.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.185
Uh, tonight.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.187
We'll tell him together.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.555
(chuckles)

17:04.557 --> 17:06.858
Well, yeah, tell
him together.
Yeah, yeah.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.395
Hurry up, Tray.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.630
Jesus is not coming,
is he, Boonie?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.332
I tried to get
Jesus to come.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.868
He didn't like the creative
direction this video was taking.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.136
You know, this is the last time

17:18.138 --> 17:20.872
I bring some hoes over
for your ass.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.740
Guys, listen, okay?
Instead of arguing

17:22.742 --> 17:24.208
and fighting,
why don't we just,

17:24.210 --> 17:26.144
like, pray really hard
and maybe he'll show up.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.479
Hey, might as well, man.
Well, yeah.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.714
Fine.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.519
Dear Jesus,

17:34.521 --> 17:37.822
I'm here at this stupid
(bleep) video shoot

17:37.824 --> 17:39.824
for one of your
asshole disciples,

17:39.826 --> 17:42.160
who promised
that you'd be here.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.828
I rebuke you, bitch.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.063
There are some bitches here

17:45.065 --> 17:47.498
who would really like
to meet you, Jesus,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.567
so please come soon.
Amen.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.869
MEN:
Amen.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.238
What's happening, pimps?
MAGGIE: Jesus!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.574
TRAYVON: It worked! He's here!
BOONIE: He's always on time.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.443
Bernadette!

17:58.445 --> 18:00.244
Vic, you're just in time.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.913
Bernadette!

18:01.915 --> 18:04.382
She couldn't wait to get out
of here-- what did you do?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.917
Bernadette, what about the
conversation with Lloyd?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.785
Uh, we're gonna have
that conversation,

18:07.787 --> 18:09.420
but I just have
to leave and, uh,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.022
take care of some business
right now.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.423
Uh, I'm coming back, baby,
I'm coming back!

18:12.425 --> 18:13.925
I'm coming back!
I didn't get
your number, though.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.626
I didn't get your number!
Bernadette!

18:16.862 --> 18:20.698
LLOYD:
Vic! Let the bitch go!

18:20.700 --> 18:21.899
So what I'm gonna
need y'all to do

18:21.901 --> 18:23.468
is start respecting yourself

18:23.470 --> 18:24.635
and believing in yourself,

18:24.637 --> 18:25.903
because I believe in you.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.105
You understand?
All right, man, hey.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.806
Uh, give the bitches
three minutes,

18:28.808 --> 18:30.141
then let them know it's time
to get back to work, man.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.043
Okay, perfect.
Know what I'm saying? Hey!

18:32.045 --> 18:33.978
Hey!
Hey, where the hell you going?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.547
Girl, don't act like I ain't
got your nudes in my phone!

18:36.549 --> 18:37.715
Hey, what happened?

18:37.717 --> 18:38.749
Don't blame me.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.884
Jesus gave them self-respect.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.486
Are you serious?!

18:41.488 --> 18:44.489
Hey, Jesus, I hate when you give
the bitches self-respect, man!

18:44.491 --> 18:45.890
You need you some, too.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.625
Look at you, man.
You running around here

18:47.627 --> 18:48.926
acting like you're
Yo Gotti or somebody, man.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.162
This is not you.
Knock it off.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.897
How about trying to do something
like making some money off love

18:52.899 --> 18:54.832
and kindness and respect
for women for a change, dawg.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.400
Hey, man, let's shoot
the video the way

18:56.402 --> 18:58.569
we was gonna shoot it before
the bitches even showed up.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.738
Boonie!

19:02.741 --> 19:05.176
You know, I support you, brah.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.811
I'll be in your
little heathenous,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.779
blasphemous-ass video.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.915
That's what I'm talking about!

19:10.917 --> 19:12.283
You gonna be down
with the Boon-Boon!

19:12.285 --> 19:16.187
Be down with
your Boon-Boon, baby!

19:16.189 --> 19:18.723
(laughter)

19:19.691 --> 19:21.692
We did it, buddy.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.494
You're a true friend.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.862
I won't forget this.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.764
No, Lloyd,
I'm not a true friend.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.300
I'm actually
an asshole sometimes.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.369
But I'm glad she left.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.937
You know she didn't cook shit

19:32.939 --> 19:34.772
the whole time
she was here, man.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.174
Then I'm cooking tonight.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.608
Macaroni and cheese.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.343
Ready in two minutes!

19:39.345 --> 19:40.945
(whoops)

19:40.947 --> 19:42.947
All right, so what you're
gonna do is you're gonna

19:42.949 --> 19:44.015
look right here--
that's where, that's where

19:44.017 --> 19:45.449
Boonie is;
Boonie is right here.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.851
No, but Boonie's right there.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.052
No, no, but for
the camera trick,

19:48.054 --> 19:49.287
Boonie's right there.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.955
Okay? And... action.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.158
Dear God, hear a
thug's prayer tonight

19:54.160 --> 19:56.827
for my sins that follow
me home to the crib.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.796
Forgive me for what
I'm about to do

19:58.798 --> 20:01.332
to these bitch-ass niggas.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.833
