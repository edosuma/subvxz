00:27.561 --> 00:29.097
Hi, leave
a detailed message

00:29.163 --> 00:31.865
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I possibly can.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.834
Have a great day.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.736
- James, this is Steven.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.606
Could you please call
me as soon as possible?

00:38.672 --> 00:39.507
Thanks.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.535
- She's asking for you.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.440
- She's asking for you.

01:49.877 --> 01:55.216
That's alright, we're
home and we're together.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.317
I'm happy.

02:00.388 --> 02:05.092
- I left her a message,
maybe she'll call.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.261
- She never has before.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.468
Her Bible, I need her Bible.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.854
Open it to the bookmark.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.696
- Take her Bible, Steven.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.301
Forgive her, and ask
her to forgive us.

02:51.505 --> 02:55.309
- We loved her, Steven,
but we failed her.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.781
Promise me you will
give her the Bible.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.949
Forgive her.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.386
Ask her forgiveness.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.860
- I promise.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.364
- Thank you, Steven.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.301
Please remember that I love you.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.938
I'll be waiting
for you in heaven.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.866
- She's with God now.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.674
- You did the right thing,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.944
bringing her home.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.891
It's James.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.461
- You've called at
a bad time, James.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.663
- I'm sorry I
didn't call sooner.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.432
Miranda and I have
been very, very busy.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.066
- Abigail is gone.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.969
I was hoping Miranda
would come back

05:36.036 --> 05:40.140
to see her before
it was too late.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.709
Now it's too late.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.513
The funeral was this morning.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.181
- I'm so sorry, is
there anything I can do?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.483
- Nothing.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.686
- I'll tell Miranda,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.422
I think it's something
she ought to know.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.024
- Don't you tell her a thing.

05:58.392 --> 06:01.128
Abigail had me promise
to do one thing,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.096
and I'm going to do it.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.236
- That's my business, James.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.038
Look, I wanted you to know

06:11.104 --> 06:13.674
because you were a
comfort to Abigail,

06:13.741 --> 06:17.177
letting us know how
Miranda was doing.

06:17.244 --> 06:21.615
But Abigail is gone now and I
have her wishes to consider.

06:23.684 --> 06:27.320
I will tell Miranda
that Abigail is gone,

06:27.387 --> 06:28.656
to her face.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.057
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:30.123 --> 06:34.928
- It's a terrible
idea, but I promised.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.664
I need your address.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.166
I don't know, Steven.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.268
Listen, I've got to go.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.688
Forgiveness.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.558
It's just not the
same without her.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.505
I will tell Miranda
that Abigail is gone,

11:12.572 --> 11:13.774
to her face.

11:16.176 --> 11:20.180
- Lord, am I doing
the right thing?

11:20.247 --> 11:23.784
I don't know if I can
keep this to myself.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.797
- I'm headed to the office.

13:17.865 --> 13:18.899
- Okay.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.970
You look good.
- Thank you.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.909
- Let's not talk about
dinner right now, okay?

13:28.976 --> 13:32.645
There's something I really
need to talk to you about.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.385
Sit down, please.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.791
You're starting to worry me.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.394
- Please don't be mad at me.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.332
I've been speaking with
Steven for a few months now.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.403
You know I want nothing
to do with them,

13:56.469 --> 13:59.506
and you've been talking to
him for months behind my back?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.741
- I wanted to let them
know that you were alright,

14:01.808 --> 14:05.078
but that's not the
issue right now.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.817
- He called me a few months ago.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.852
Abigail was sick.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.621
Cancer, I'm sorry.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.431
- She passed away
a few days ago.

14:32.172 --> 14:36.809
- Well there's nothing
I can do about that now.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.645
When's the funeral?

14:39.947 --> 14:42.382
- It was earlier this week.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.855
- Well I wouldn't
have gone anyway.

14:48.922 --> 14:49.889
- Wait.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.394
You talk to them for
months behind my back,

14:54.461 --> 14:57.864
and you pick now, after
Abigail's gone, to tell me that?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.132
- I didn't know what else to do.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.302
- James, they lied
to me for years.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.937
I was going to
church every Sunday,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.272
and everybody else knew
they were lying to me.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.975
And now you're lying to me?

15:10.877 --> 15:12.512
- That went well.

15:41.808 --> 15:42.642
- Liars.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.516
And now he's a liar.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.787
Knock knock,
Miranda, are you back there?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.423
- Yeah, come on in.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.999
- Thank you.

16:06.066 --> 16:10.137
I just had to get out of
that house for a minute.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.806
Oh, I'm interrupting you.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.643
- No, no, no, it's fine.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.579
Turns out I needed some company.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.913
- Me too.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.449
Who would think with
doctors and nurses

16:22.515 --> 16:24.284
and therapists barging
around the house all day

16:24.351 --> 16:26.553
I'd need company, but...

16:27.787 --> 16:30.923
I could use a moment of
quiet time with a friend.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.029
- He's getting better every day.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.566
He recognizes me now and
the therapist said that

16:39.632 --> 16:42.602
he should be out of
the wheelchair in
a couple of months.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.839
And the nurses are optimistic
too, but the doctors...

16:46.906 --> 16:48.875
- Don't listen to the doctors.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.110
Doctors are always pessimists,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.379
listen to the therapists
and the nurses.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.014
They're the ones spending
all this time with Michael.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.985
- Yeah, they spend more
time with him than I do.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.289
And with that realization,
I need to get home.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.757
Mike will be
wondering where I am.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.694
- Well, come back any
time, I'll make some tea.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.896
- I took our health and the
lives we had for granted.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.165
Never again.

18:21.834 --> 18:26.406
Why
am I doing this to myself?

18:28.141 --> 18:31.278
Hmm, car's running
a little rough.

18:31.344 --> 18:35.415
I think I'll get off
the interstate for now.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.176
- You were working
late last night.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.178
I tried not to wake you.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.514
- Yeah, I didn't sleep well.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.683
Listen, I'm sorry I went
against your wishes.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.686
- I haven't spoken to
them for years, by choice.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.822
You had no right
to just call them.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.656
- I know.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.326
- And Abigail dying
doesn't change that.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.362
I'm not going back there, ever.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.799
I have a birth mother,
we have a relationship.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.700
That's it.

19:31.271 --> 19:35.408
- I better do something
before he gets here.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.871
I'm pretty good with cars.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.873
- That makes one of us.

20:43.209 --> 20:43.910
Steven.

20:43.976 --> 20:44.811
- Joseph.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.479
- Nice to meet you.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.783
Guess I'll have to
walk back into town.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.320
Gotta be a couple miles.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.122
- I just walked
through that town.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.190
It's nice, but I'm don't think

20:58.257 --> 21:00.827
there's a mechanic
there that can help you.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.029
Not on a Saturday, anyway.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.599
Is it Saturday already?

21:06.666 --> 21:11.938
When you're retired the days
just sorta run together.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.107
- Every day is a gift
from the Lord, Steven.

21:15.174 --> 21:19.546
Trouble is, some people think
he gave us an endless supply.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.518
I think I feel a
loose wire here.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.654
That might've gotten it.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.691
Alright, hop in
and start 'er up.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.080
You're all set to go.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.017
- Los Angeles.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.621
- That'd be great.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.556
- Wonderful, hop in.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.527
You've reached my
cell phone voicemail,

22:07.594 --> 22:10.296
please leave a message.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.632
- I assume you're
already headed this way.

22:12.699 --> 22:17.036
Our address is 407 Valley
View Drive, Sherman Oaks.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.711
In for a penny, in for a pound.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.979
I hope Miranda can
forgive me for this,

22:27.046 --> 22:29.482
I'm keeping this from her too.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.890
- Sure is nice to finally get
away from all that grey sky,

22:37.957 --> 22:39.959
but it's getting colder.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.464
By the way, I have
an extra jacket.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.434
You can borrow it if you want.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.841
Not exactly the
talkative type, are you?

22:56.609 --> 22:59.078
- I'm just enjoying the scenery.

22:59.145 --> 23:02.749
It's a lot to take in
traveling this fast.

23:02.815 --> 23:08.054
You're the first
person who's said I drive fast.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.023
- Well, I've been walking.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.826
- I like driving
these old highways.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.997
You get to see a little bit of
what America used to be like.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.266
You miss a lot driving
the interstates,

23:20.332 --> 23:22.602
and even more when you fly.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.573
- I like this speed just fine,

23:28.675 --> 23:31.511
and the scenery is beautiful.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.750
- The scenery will get
better as we go west.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.552
- Ah, yes, the mountains.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.421
I am looking forward to that.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.257
- Have you ever been
through the Rockies?

23:45.324 --> 23:46.693
- No, not yet.

23:48.495 --> 23:51.230
- Well, you're in
for a real treat.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.965
- Take your time.

23:53.032 --> 23:58.270
I haven't had my fill of
these wide open spaces.

23:58.337 --> 24:02.575
Me, I get tired
of the flat after a while.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.480
- I could never tire of this.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.216
- Maybe you're right.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.153
It does have a sort of
stark beauty about it.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.182
What'd you get?

24:43.249 --> 24:45.618
- Bread and peanut butter.

24:56.295 --> 25:00.700
- Yeah, peanut butter,
the world's perfect food.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.750
- Good sandwich.

25:47.146 --> 25:51.718
- We've gotta stop for the
night, I'm getting too tired.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.922
- We're in Pueblo, Colorado.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.958
I'm gonna get a room.

25:59.025 --> 26:02.461
I'm too old to
bunk with somebody.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.130
- That's fine.

26:04.196 --> 26:07.600
No reason for me to
spend money on a room.

26:07.667 --> 26:12.504
I don't mind sleeping
outside, I like the view.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.106
- Suit yourself.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.430
See you in the morning.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.632
- Alright.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.787
Hey, Joseph!

27:36.756 --> 27:38.657
- Did you decide the
room was too stuffy?

27:38.725 --> 27:40.059
- I decided that
spending the extra money

27:40.126 --> 27:42.962
for another room
wasn't a bad idea.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.531
Besides that, it's gonna
rain, you'll get drenched.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.368
- I guess you're right.

27:49.435 --> 27:53.806
- You got the car running,
it's the least I can do.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.241
Okay, come on.

28:05.517 --> 28:09.956
- Thank you Lord for
providing me a friend

28:10.022 --> 28:12.759
that cared enough
to give me shelter.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.752
I found some tea bags
next to the coffee maker.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.587
Would you care to join
me in a cup of green tea?

29:15.654 --> 29:16.923
- Come on in.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.091
- It'll help you sleep.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.759
- I don't normally need
help getting to sleep,

29:20.827 --> 29:23.529
but a cup of tea sounds nice.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.067
- I don't mean to bother you.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.869
I just enjoy sipping
a cup of green tea

29:29.936 --> 29:33.339
and having intelligent
conversation in the evening,

29:33.405 --> 29:35.774
when the opportunity
presents itself.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.810
- It's a good idea.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.579
I was just going to
do a little reading

29:40.646 --> 29:42.581
before going to sleep.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.451
- That's a fine choice.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.853
What's your favorite book?

29:46.919 --> 29:48.387
- Acts.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.324
I like reading about
action, not just words.

29:53.826 --> 29:57.396
- I remember that
printing, 1970s, I think.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.968
- You've got a great memory.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.937
It was a gift to my daughter.

30:11.443 --> 30:15.114
- That's a long story
and very private.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.852
- I don't mean to pry.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.723
Nice tea by the way.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.158
- It was a good idea,

30:26.225 --> 30:31.663
but we've got all day for
intelligent conversation.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.800
- I can tell you're busy.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.469
I can finish this in my room.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.809
What time are we checking out?

30:43.876 --> 30:47.113
- I'd like to get on the
road by eight o'clock.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.815
- Again, thank you for the room.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.517
It was very nice.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.485
- You're welcome.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.453
Good night.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.036
Good morning, sleep well?

31:11.037 --> 31:13.105
Sure did.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.086
- Just so you know, I
like to stop now and then

31:27.153 --> 31:30.689
and stretch my legs,
and enjoy the scenery.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.764
Boy, I wish Abigail was
here with me to see this.

32:12.831 --> 32:15.201
She would really enjoy it.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.640
Oh, I miss her.

32:42.394 --> 32:45.964
Steven, I'm having
second thoughts about this.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.067
Please give me a call.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.636
- I'm already in Colorado.

32:50.702 --> 32:54.140
I'll be there in
a couple of days.

33:11.090 --> 33:15.127
Come on, Joseph, time
to get back on the road.

33:53.899 --> 33:56.902
Hard to believe it was so
warm just two days ago.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.371
Now we're surrounded by snow.

34:29.501 --> 34:34.306
I have to make a phone call,
gimme about five minutes.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.675
- Well, I'll just wander.

34:57.129 --> 35:00.732
It's Steven,
returning your call.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.067
- Listen, I'm glad you called.

35:02.134 --> 35:03.402
I've really been having
some second thoughts

35:03.469 --> 35:04.970
about you coming out here.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.872
- It's too late for that, James.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.140
I'm already in Colorado.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.708
I'll be there in
a couple of days.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.010
- Well, then, listen, I'm
going to have to tell Miranda.

35:12.077 --> 35:14.813
I just can't have you you
show up unannounced like that.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.215
- I understand.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.417
As a matter of fact,
I insist you tell her.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.919
If she still chooses
not to see me, so be it.

35:20.986 --> 35:24.523
- Either way, you're really
putting me in a bad spot here.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.892
- The middle is
always awkward, James.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.928
You just tell her and I'll
deal with the consequences.

35:29.995 --> 35:34.700
- Alright, listen, see you
soon, have a safe drive.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.235
- Alright, bye.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.840
- Yeah, he'll deal with
the consequences, right.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.713
- I don't know.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.218
- Would you like
to talk about it?

35:52.284 --> 35:55.387
- No, I need some time to think.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.614
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.953
- Everyone was asking about you.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.424
- Every Sunday.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.730
- I don't know.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.271
- Steven's coming
to Los Angeles.

36:48.974 --> 36:52.611
- It's a free country,
LA's a big city.

36:54.112 --> 36:56.482
- I gave him our address.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.219
Strike two.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.629
- I'm chopping vegetables, I
would stand back if I were you.

37:10.696 --> 37:14.266
- Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
I didn't know what to do.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.834
- I don't understand
what's going on here.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.270
I don't understand
what your problem is.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.906
This is my life,
this is my decision.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.875
It took everything I had to
pack my bags and leave Kentucky,

37:23.942 --> 37:25.311
and I'm not going back there.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.145
- I know, but all the
blame, all the hate...

37:27.212 --> 37:28.947
- I don't hate them.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.616
- Then give him a chance.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.618
Let him see you one more
time before he dies.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.820
Is that really too much to ask?

37:34.886 --> 37:35.987
- Yes, it is.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.559
- Well, then, maybe we
should take some time off

37:40.626 --> 37:42.361
and just not be here
when he gets here.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.862
- I don't know.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.301
You've had some time
to think about this.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.036
Let me think about
it for a while.

37:51.102 --> 37:51.937
- Fine.

38:03.081 --> 38:06.585
- Good Lord gave us this
beautiful country to live in,

38:06.652 --> 38:08.487
the Bible to live by,

38:08.554 --> 38:11.189
and delicious peanut
butter sandwiches.

38:11.256 --> 38:14.660
Be greedy to ask
for anything else.

38:14.726 --> 38:18.730
- God gave me a beautiful
wife, a wonderful home,

38:18.797 --> 38:22.334
good health, and
now this journey.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.970
- Traveling with your
daughter's bible.

38:25.036 --> 38:29.040
Sure would like to
know more about that.

38:29.107 --> 38:33.044
- I'm not ready to
talk about that yet.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.647
Wonder what the first
settlers thought

39:41.713 --> 39:44.950
when they saw that
wall of mountains.

39:46.251 --> 39:51.222
- I'd imagine a combination
of awe and discouragement.

39:51.289 --> 39:56.928
- Kinda like the way most
people approach life today.

39:56.995 --> 40:00.832
- I can't tell if that's
profound or just depressing.

40:36.034 --> 40:36.835
- Come on.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.219
- I don't want to
fight with you, James.

41:28.286 --> 41:32.023
- I don't want to
fight with you either.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.327
- How long have you
been talking to Steven?

41:36.394 --> 41:39.164
- For about a year now.

41:40.465 --> 41:41.900
You started this?

41:42.801 --> 41:44.235
- After you told me about them,

41:44.302 --> 41:48.774
I figured I'd call 'em so
they wouldn't worry about you.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.209
- Let me see if I've
got this straight.

41:51.276 --> 41:52.443
You give them a
call after you knew

41:52.510 --> 41:54.145
I didn't want them in our lives,

41:54.212 --> 41:55.413
and then you find
out Abigail is dying,

41:55.480 --> 41:56.582
and you don't tell me?

41:56.648 --> 41:57.583
- I wasn't thinking.

41:57.649 --> 41:58.850
I thought I'd give them a call

41:58.917 --> 42:00.451
just so they could
have some peace.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.155
And then this whole
thing with Abigail...

42:04.222 --> 42:08.627
I thought I would have
to admit the call then.

42:08.694 --> 42:11.997
- And now he's coming out
here, do you know why?

42:12.063 --> 42:14.365
- No, not really, just
to come see you I gather.

42:14.432 --> 42:17.435
- Well tell him not to come,
tell him he's not welcome.

42:17.502 --> 42:19.571
- I did, he's coming anyway.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.707
- That 'cause you
gave him our address.

42:24.142 --> 42:28.213
- I don't need people in
my life that I can't trust.

42:28.279 --> 42:32.117
- Did you ever think
of forgiving them?

42:32.183 --> 42:33.985
- Never crossed my mind.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.554
- Maybe we should go
out of town for a while.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.123
- No, we're staying.

42:38.189 --> 42:39.424
You wanted this,

42:39.490 --> 42:43.094
now you're going to see
what's gonna happen.

43:48.093 --> 43:51.062
- There's a lot of answers
in that book, Steven,

43:51.129 --> 43:55.333
but perhaps not about
your particular situation.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.737
Would you care to
share your story?

44:05.143 --> 44:09.014
- This is something
I've never told anyone.

44:14.285 --> 44:19.590
It was a secret that Abigail
and I protected for many years.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.961
- Maybe it's time
you told someone.

44:24.429 --> 44:26.865
- My wife Abigail
and I were married

44:26.932 --> 44:29.868
for 48 years, she
died last week.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.175
- I'm very sorry to hear that.

44:41.579 --> 44:43.281
- A few years into our marriage

44:43.348 --> 44:48.053
we found out we couldn't
have any children of our own.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.221
Abigail was devastated.

44:53.524 --> 44:57.896
Then after about a year,
she decided we should adopt.

44:59.898 --> 45:03.501
I wasn't sold on the idea,
but Abigail said that

45:03.568 --> 45:07.672
we had an opportunity to
make a child's life better.

45:07.739 --> 45:10.041
Who could argue with that?

45:10.108 --> 45:11.509
- It's a noble
thing to wanna make

45:11.576 --> 45:13.344
someone else's life better.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.581
- That's what Abigail said.

45:16.647 --> 45:18.649
So we went to an adoption agency

45:18.716 --> 45:20.418
and found a little angel.

45:21.853 --> 45:25.623
She was three years
old and her name was,

45:25.690 --> 45:26.825
is Miranda.

45:29.594 --> 45:33.965
This is the Bible we gave
her when she came to us.

45:36.968 --> 45:38.736
We wanted to raise her right,

45:38.804 --> 45:42.707
see to it that she went
to church every Sunday.

45:42.774 --> 45:45.310
She grew up loving the Lord.

45:46.611 --> 45:51.316
The day she was baptized is
a day I will never forget.

45:51.382 --> 45:52.951
Then she turned 18.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.790
Abigail and I had
discussed it for years,

46:00.158 --> 46:03.594
but we decided it was finally
time to tell her the truth,

46:03.661 --> 46:05.396
that she was adopted.

46:07.198 --> 46:09.935
- And I'm assuming that
didn't go very well.

46:10.001 --> 46:13.905
- Worse than you could
have ever imagined.

46:15.573 --> 46:17.909
She called us liars.

46:17.976 --> 46:20.078
Said that she hated us,

46:23.514 --> 46:26.184
that her whole life
had been a lie.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.919
She said she'd been the brunt

46:27.986 --> 46:31.189
of a 15 years practical joke,
everyone else was in on it,

46:31.256 --> 46:35.793
that the whole parish was
laughing at her behind her back.

46:37.996 --> 46:39.797
She said she hated us,

46:39.865 --> 46:43.969
she never wanted to see
us again, and she left.

46:46.004 --> 46:48.039
That was 25 years ago.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.544
- And you haven't
seen her since?

46:53.611 --> 46:56.381
- No calls, no letters, nothing.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.888
We figured the worst, of course.

47:04.589 --> 47:07.592
But then, about a year ago,

47:07.658 --> 47:12.097
we got a call from a
man in Los Angeles.

47:12.163 --> 47:16.467
Said he was Miranda's
husband, James.

47:16.534 --> 47:20.238
Said he'd looked us
up on the Internet,

47:20.305 --> 47:23.841
I still don't know
how that's legal.

47:23.909 --> 47:26.811
Anyway, he gave
us his cell phone

47:26.878 --> 47:30.115
and we talked to
him now and then.

47:33.151 --> 47:36.721
- That was nice of him
to reach out to you.

47:36.787 --> 47:38.256
- Yes, it was.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.928
But he didn't tell Miranda.

47:45.530 --> 47:48.566
He said that she
hadn't changed her mind

47:48.633 --> 47:52.137
and it was unlikely
that she would.

47:53.738 --> 47:55.773
- Then your wife got sick.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.075
- Yes.

47:58.944 --> 48:04.115
I told James that Abigail
wanted to see Miranda.

48:04.182 --> 48:07.085
But he either didn't tell her,

48:08.819 --> 48:10.221
or she was unmoved.

48:11.789 --> 48:16.161
Either way, Abigail died without
ever seeing Miranda again.

48:18.029 --> 48:23.268
Abigail's dying wish was
that I take this Bible

48:23.334 --> 48:26.471
to Miranda and ask
her forgiveness,

48:27.973 --> 48:31.009
and tell her that
we forgive her.

48:31.076 --> 48:32.510
- I trust Abigail's true wish

48:32.577 --> 48:35.680
is for Miranda to
turn back to the Lord.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.549
- Mothers only want what's
best for their children,

48:38.616 --> 48:41.619
even if we aren't
flesh and blood.

48:53.731 --> 48:57.202
- Thank you for
sharing that, Steven.

49:01.706 --> 49:05.176
- It's good to
finally tell somebody.

50:33.264 --> 50:36.234
- What if she
still won't see me?

50:39.036 --> 50:42.107
- Perhaps her
heart has softened.

50:42.173 --> 50:46.043
- That would be
wonderful, but I doubt it.

50:49.013 --> 50:51.282
- Let's ask God for help,

50:52.450 --> 50:54.952
and hopefully your
daughter will welcome you

50:55.019 --> 50:57.522
with open arms when we arrive.

51:00.024 --> 51:01.292
- Absolutely.

51:12.137 --> 51:13.138
- Amen.

51:14.505 --> 51:17.142
- Now let's get going, you've
got a Bible to deliver.

51:17.208 --> 51:18.243
- Yes.

51:30.288 --> 51:34.659
- I'm gonna take the pup
for a walk in a few, but...

51:36.394 --> 51:38.229
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

51:38.296 --> 51:39.764
It's important.

51:42.300 --> 51:44.034
- It's okay, James,
I forgive you.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.002
It's gonna work out, okay?

51:45.069 --> 51:46.437
Let's just forget about it.

51:46.504 --> 51:48.373
- I can't forget about it.

51:48.439 --> 51:51.576
It's something I have to say.

51:51.642 --> 51:52.910
Listen--

51:52.977 --> 51:55.480
- You sure you wanna poke
the bear again, really?

51:55.546 --> 51:59.284
- Let me start by saying
that I love you very much.

51:59.350 --> 52:03.454
These have been the best
five years of my life.

52:03.521 --> 52:05.790
And I'll be the
first to say that

52:05.856 --> 52:08.626
I probably have no idea
what I'm talking about.

52:08.693 --> 52:13.931
I have great parents, I
had a wonderful childhood,

52:13.998 --> 52:17.868
and it's helped to make me
the man that I am today.

52:17.935 --> 52:20.104
- Well so far you haven't
said anything to make me mad,

52:20.171 --> 52:21.406
so go on.

52:23.274 --> 52:24.742
- Here goes.

52:24.809 --> 52:27.144
I'm only basing this on
what you've told me, okay?

52:27.212 --> 52:29.414
I don't have any
information from Abigail,

52:29.480 --> 52:31.449
or Steven, or anyone.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.655
You gotta get over yourself.

52:39.123 --> 52:40.891
- You have two people
who loved you enough

52:40.958 --> 52:44.862
to give you a home, feed
you, clothe you, educate you,

52:44.929 --> 52:47.832
teach you about God,
and respected the Bible.

52:47.898 --> 52:50.301
And this is how you repay
'em for all their love?

52:50.368 --> 52:51.302
- They lied to me!

52:51.369 --> 52:52.603
- To protect you!

52:52.670 --> 52:54.071
What, do you think
they were running

52:54.138 --> 52:55.740
some big scam on
you or something?

52:55.806 --> 52:57.842
That's ridic--
- They owed me the truth.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.444
- They owed you nothing.

52:59.510 --> 53:02.547
They gave of themselves,
freely, they loved you.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.649
And now you can't make
amends with your mother.

53:04.715 --> 53:08.152
That's right, I said
it, your mother.

53:08.219 --> 53:09.854
And now your father's
coming out here,

53:09.920 --> 53:12.056
and you have a big
choice to make.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.424
A big choice.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.361
Make a decision.

53:51.962 --> 53:53.798
- Black Dragon Canyon.

53:57.302 --> 54:01.038
- You know, Steven, I'm
in no particular hurry,

54:01.105 --> 54:04.141
but if we keep stopping at
every point of interest,

54:04.208 --> 54:07.678
we'll never make
it to Los Angeles.

54:07.745 --> 54:11.482
- Okay, I get what
you're saying, let's go.

55:05.503 --> 55:07.372
- I was thinking,

55:07.438 --> 55:10.207
if we're gonna be driving
through Las Vegas,

55:10.274 --> 55:12.910
maybe you could
just drop me off.

55:12.977 --> 55:14.479
- Well we're headed
in that direction,

55:14.545 --> 55:17.415
but I wasn't planning
on stopping there.

55:17.482 --> 55:20.485
No reason to stop in Las Vegas.

55:23.388 --> 55:27.091
What's so important
in Las Vegas?

55:27.157 --> 55:28.426
- I just remembered
I got some business

55:28.493 --> 55:30.628
that I have to take care of.

55:33.431 --> 55:35.666
- I'm fairly certain
I can catch a ride.

55:35.733 --> 55:39.404
No shortage of people
going back and forth.

55:39.470 --> 55:42.540
- Well, if that's what you want.

55:43.574 --> 55:46.343
Where should I drop you?

55:46.411 --> 55:48.345
- Middle of the Strip.

55:48.413 --> 55:49.414
That's where the action is.

55:51.281 --> 55:52.883
- Not even close.

55:54.585 --> 55:58.423
There are some people
there that need me.

56:03.160 --> 56:04.462
- Well, if it's that
important to you,

56:04.529 --> 56:07.498
that's where I'll drop you off.

57:15.099 --> 57:17.535
- Only a few miles out now.

57:20.538 --> 57:24.008
I get the feeling don't
like Las Vegas much.

57:25.375 --> 57:28.245
Gambling, drunkenness,
prostitution?

57:28.312 --> 57:30.581
And that's what they promote.

57:30.648 --> 57:34.418
- A modern day
Sodom and Gomorrah.

57:34.485 --> 57:37.454
- Yeah, with a
big electric bill.

57:37.522 --> 57:38.989
- That's right.

57:41.559 --> 57:44.829
You can just drop me
off and keep driving.

57:44.895 --> 57:48.933
- What is so important
about Las Vegas anyway?

57:50.901 --> 57:53.303
- Let's just say I
have some work to do

57:53.370 --> 57:55.873
and leave it at that, alright?

57:58.342 --> 57:59.544
- I guess we both have things

57:59.610 --> 58:02.379
we'd rather not talk about.

58:02.446 --> 58:03.914
- I suppose so.

58:05.249 --> 58:06.751
Let's go.

58:40.918 --> 58:43.120
- The New Testament
tells us that often Jesus

58:43.187 --> 58:47.992
and his apostles spent
time among sinners.

58:48.058 --> 58:49.994
- Well, if they were
going to spread his word,

58:50.060 --> 58:52.830
that's where they needed to be.

58:55.700 --> 58:59.536
- Which is why I need
to go to Las Vegas.

59:00.905 --> 59:03.641
- Is that why you're
hitchhiking across country?

59:03.708 --> 59:05.643
To spread the Word?

59:09.013 --> 59:11.548
- I have a light to shine
in the darkness, Steven.

59:11.616 --> 59:14.785
- Then, why don't
you let me help you?

59:18.723 --> 59:21.659
- You have your
own path to walk.

59:37.407 --> 59:41.979
Kinda puts a bit of perspective
on our problems, doesn't it?

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:08.432
- Might as well
hold onto that coat.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:12.970
I hear it gets cold in Las
Vegas, especially at night.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:28.485
Are you sure you
want to do this?

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:29.386
- I am.

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:35.225
- Well, seeing as we'll
be parting company,

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.195
there's something else
I want to tell you.

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:46.303
- When James called to
tell us Miranda was okay,

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.739
Abigail wanted to leave
right there and then,

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:51.976
to go to Los Angeles,
but I refused.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:01.051
- I was being prideful.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.689
I told Abigail if
Amanda wanted to see us,

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:07.424
she knew where we lived.

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:12.429
We weren't going to be
the ones who gave in.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:17.067
Shortly after that, Abigail
was too sick to travel.

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:24.008
I had denied Abigail a
chance to see Miranda again.

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:28.745
She died shortly after that.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:38.622
- Well at least you're
fulfilling her last wish now.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.391
Abigail would be proud of you.

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.528
- I do.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:49.867
And I know one day you'll
be united in heaven.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.718
Thank you for the ride, Steven.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.587
- You be careful here now.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.656
- Thank you, be careful driving.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.991
- Oh, I will.

01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:16.393
I guess this is goodbye.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.930
- Goodbye for now, I'm
sure we'll meet again.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:21.398
- Perhaps.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.633
- Good luck to you.

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.768
- Thank you.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.314
Boy I'm tired.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.885
I think I'm gonna pull
over and take a little nap.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.369
Not ideal, but it'll have to do.

01:05:26.991 --> 01:05:30.194
- Let me get that,
it could be work.

01:05:50.214 --> 01:05:51.881
- Hello, James, it's Steven.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.051
- Hello, it's good
to hear from you.

01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:55.419
Where are you?

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.589
- I'm at Baker, I'll be
there in about three hours.

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:00.824
- That's just fine.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.858
Do you know how to get here?

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:03.127
- I've got a map.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:05.929
If I have any
trouble, I'll call.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:08.232
- Alright, see you
in a few hours.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.401
- James, do you
think she'll see me?

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:14.971
I don't know
if she wants to see you,

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:16.573
but she's not going anywhere.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.843
- I suppose that'll
have to be good enough.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.011
See you soon.

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:22.112
- Bye.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:30.920
- I spoke to Steven.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:34.124
He's gonna be here
in a few hours.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.762
- Listen, maybe I can make
us all something for lunch.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.030
- That'd be great.

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:41.298
Listen, I gotta
go to the office.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:44.168
I'll be back in a
few hours, okay?

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:45.569
- Don't be late.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:46.736
Okay.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.612
- Well, this is nice.

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:44.128
Here I go.

01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:11.988
- Did you forget your
keys again, James?

01:08:12.055 --> 01:08:13.223
- Hi, Pumpkin.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.332
- Hi, Dad.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.103
You wanna come in?

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.305
I made some iced tea.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.073
- I'd love that.

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.341
- You look great.

01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:07.411
- Thanks.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:13.317
I guess we have a
lot to talk about.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:17.754
- I didn't come here to talk
about the last 25 years.

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.363
- To bring you this.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:39.309
- It's my Bible
from Sunday School.

01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:46.450
- Before she died, your
mother wanted me to bring this

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.419
and to ask for your forgiveness.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:09:59.496
- We made a mistake.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:05.068
Your mother wanted
you to know that,

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:07.471
and to bring you that Bible.

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:14.744
- All of this time I've been
so angry at the both of you,

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.016
and I'm just
beginning to realize

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:22.752
I had nothing to be angry about.

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.855
And now she's gone

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:33.597
and I didn't get the chance
to tell her that I was wrong,

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:36.400
and ask for her forgiveness.

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:42.972
- She forgives you, and
one day you'll know that,

01:10:44.508 --> 01:10:47.344
because God forgives you too.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:53.883
- I don't pray, I
don't go to church.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:57.387
- Don't you think
it's time to start?

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:16.105
- I forgive you Dad,
do you forgive me?

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:20.744
- I just drove over 2,000 miles
to tell this to your face.

01:11:22.546 --> 01:11:23.613
I forgive you.

01:11:37.361 --> 01:11:39.563
Now tell me about James.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:02.519
Lord, please
help me make a difference.

01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:09.526
- Hi, Hon.
- Hey.

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:12.929
- This is my husband.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.364
- You must be James.

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.733
Honey, this is my
father, Steven Campbell.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.867
- It's nice to
finally meet you, sir.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:19.235
- You too.

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:20.837
And thanks for helping
make this happen.

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:22.171
- You got it.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:24.874
- You were supposed
to be home sooner.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.710
- I know, I saw you two
talking on the porch

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:30.447
and I figured to give
you a little time alone.

01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:32.782
- Thank you, we needed it.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.384
- Oh, we did.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.352
- I'm going to take
my Bible inside.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.354
Would you like something
to drink, some iced tea?

01:12:38.422 --> 01:12:39.589
- Yes, please.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.058
What a sweetheart.

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:47.196
- It looks like you guys had
a pretty good conversation.

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:50.166
- It took a while, but
we found a good place.

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:51.901
And it's all thanks to you.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:54.237
- Well, I just couldn't
see her carrying around

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:55.972
all that anger and pity.

01:12:56.039 --> 01:13:00.376
It was really affecting her,
spiritually, emotionally.

01:13:00.444 --> 01:13:01.878
- She told me she would take

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:05.148
her Bible with her
to church on Sunday.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:07.383
- That makes me very happy.

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:09.719
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:13:09.786 --> 01:13:13.289
- So, if you don't have
any plans for this evening,

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:14.891
then how about I cook us dinner?

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:18.027
And of course you're
staying with us.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.328
- I appreciate the offer,

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.398
but I've already
checked into a hotel

01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:24.167
and I have plans for later.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:28.572
- Abigail and I always
wanted to watch the sunset

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:33.142
over the Pacific Ocean, but
never had a chance to do that.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:35.144
I'm gonna do that this evening.

01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:36.079
- We can come with you.

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.447
- Yeah.

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:40.416
- No, this is something
I'd rather do by myself.

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:43.720
- The nearest beach.

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:46.222
Sunset's in a couple of hours,

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.591
I think I'd better get going.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:52.228
I've experienced LA
traffic first hand.

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:53.963
- Alright, let's go.

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:03.473
- Tell you what, let
me take you both out

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.141
for breakfast in the morning,

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:07.010
then tomorrow night
I'll take you up

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:08.745
on that dinner invitation.

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:10.914
- That sounds fine.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.551
- Thanks again for
making this happen.

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.725
- Be safe, take care.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:49.813
- There it is, Abigail,
just like you imagined.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:57.954
- It's a beautiful sunset,
isn't it old friend?

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:02.358
- Joseph, what are
you doing here?

01:16:02.425 --> 01:16:03.660
- Let me tell you a story

01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:06.562
as we watch the
light fade together.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.031
About a beloved wife,

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:10.066
who asked for her husband
to join her in heaven

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:14.771
after he finished his final
task of saving your daughter.

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:16.305
Are you an angel?

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:19.342
- I was sent here to
accompany you on your journey,

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:23.780
and asked to bring you home
when you were finished.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.985
It's time to go home Steven.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:36.025
* Embracing all the questions
nestled in your head

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:40.363
* Right and wrong are concepts
of something you just said

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:45.401
* Forgiveness is an idea
you won't give a chance

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:49.839
* Your life's a random
series of lonely circumstance

01:16:52.008 --> 01:16:56.379
* Then something
marvelous occurred

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:04.153
* You were guided by the word

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:08.825
* From a voice you always heard

01:17:08.892 --> 01:17:13.462
* Letters, numbers on a page

01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:18.334
* Released you from that cage

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:22.739
* You were guided by the word

01:17:22.806 --> 01:17:26.776
* Where forgiveness and love

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:32.081
* Were passed down from above

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:37.620
* Yes, something
marvelous occurred

01:17:37.687 --> 01:17:41.925
* You were guided by the word

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:55.071
* Questions now seek answers,
no longer on your mind

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:59.508
* Right and wrong are concrete
when truth is what you find

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:04.380
* Forgiveness is conviction
you hold near your heart

01:18:04.447 --> 01:18:08.818
* No longer to be seeking
for those you drove apart

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:15.925
* Then something
marvelous occurred

01:18:18.762 --> 01:18:23.066
* You were guided by the word

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:28.004
* From a voice you always heard

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:32.008
* Letters, numbers on a page

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:37.713
* Released you from that cage

01:18:37.781 --> 01:18:42.118
* You were guided by the word

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:46.122
* Where forgiveness and love

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:51.127
* Were passed down from above

01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:56.900
* Yes, something
marvelous occurred

01:18:56.966 --> 01:19:01.004
* You were guided by the word

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:08.177
* You were guided by the word

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:13.016
* Letters, numbers on a page

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:18.287
* Released you from that cage

01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:23.459
* But something
marvelous occurred

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:27.363
* You were guided by the word

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:34.187
