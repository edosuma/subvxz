00:06.807 --> 00:08.509
Hi, Charlie.
Teddy here.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.810
And Ivy.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.046
So you're
11 months old now

00:12.080 --> 00:14.148
and something really big
is about to happen to you.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.317
You're about to take
your very first steps.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.818
( both scream )

00:17.851 --> 00:20.154
This is your
biggest milestone

00:20.188 --> 00:21.822
since your first
solid poop.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.357
Eww.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.593
Okay, relax.
I didn't get it on video.

00:25.626 --> 00:29.163
Okay, you're my best
friend again.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.832
Anyways, I wanted to capture
your first steps on tape

00:31.865 --> 00:33.834
but every time I put
the camera on you,

00:33.867 --> 00:36.070
all I see is this.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.840
Wait.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.842
Wait.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.611
- Wait.
- ( Charlie coos )

00:43.644 --> 00:45.446
And nothing.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.815
Same thing happened
with the poop.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.250
( rock music playing )

00:49.283 --> 00:50.851
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

00:50.884 --> 00:52.386
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

00:52.420 --> 00:55.189
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

00:55.223 --> 00:57.191
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

00:57.225 --> 00:59.193
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

00:59.227 --> 01:01.562
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

01:01.595 --> 01:04.865
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

01:04.898 --> 01:08.269
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

01:08.302 --> 01:10.404
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:10.438 --> 01:12.206
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

01:12.240 --> 01:15.109
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

01:15.143 --> 01:16.877
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:16.910 --> 01:18.546
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

01:18.579 --> 01:21.482
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

01:21.515 --> 01:24.152
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

01:24.185 --> 01:27.355
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

01:27.388 --> 01:31.425
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

01:33.161 --> 01:35.463
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.539
( crowd cheering on TV )

01:45.573 --> 01:48.142
GIRLS, GIRLS, COME HERE.
CHECK IT OUT.

01:48.176 --> 01:51.679
IT'S AN OLD VIDEO
OF ME.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.681
LOTS OF VIDEOTAPING
IN THIS FAMILY.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.883
YOU GUYS SURE DO
LIKE YOURSELVES.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.919
IT'S FROM MY OLD GLORY DAYS
BACK AT SOUTH HIGH.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.289
NO WAY, MRS. D.
YOU WENT TO OUR SCHOOL?

02:01.322 --> 02:04.425
NO, YOU'RE GOING
TO MY SCHOOL.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.428
WHOA WHOA, THERE I AM--

02:07.461 --> 02:09.663
THE SCHOOL MASCOT.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.565
YOU WERE THAT
BIG SHEEP THING?

02:11.599 --> 02:14.168
NOT A SHEEP.
A RAM.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.703
RAMMY THE WAMMY.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.638
HERE IT IS--

02:17.671 --> 02:20.341
MY FAMOUS WAMMY WIGGLE.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.614
LISTEN TO THE CROWD.
THEY LOVE ME.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.482
WELL, SURE.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.651
EVERYBODY LOVES
A DANCING SHEEP.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.720
AGAIN,

02:32.753 --> 02:35.323
IT'S A RAM.
IT HAS HORNS.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.459
IT SURE LOOKS LIKE
A LOT OF FUN, MOM.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.494
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

02:40.528 --> 02:42.663
YEAH YEAH.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.665
DO YOU THINK I'D SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:44.698 --> 02:47.735
JUST TO HUMOR YOU?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.737
I'M SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT

02:49.770 --> 02:52.273
BECAUSE THEY'RE HOLDING
MASCOT TRYOUTS THIS WEEK.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.208
BUT, MOM, YOU'VE ALREADY
BEEN WAMMY.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.543
WHY WOULD YOU
TRY OUT AGAIN?

02:55.576 --> 02:57.545
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.680
PLEASE TELL ME
"YOU" IS IVY.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.682
THINK ABOUT IT, TEDDY.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.718
YOU WOULD BE THE FIRST EVER
SECOND-GENERATION WAMMY.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.688
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS
SINCE YOU WERE BORN.

03:07.721 --> 03:11.659
ACCORDING TO THE INTERNET,
SHEEP CAN HAVE HORNS.

03:11.692 --> 03:15.396
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO PUT
ANY PRESSURE ON YOU.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.765
IT'S YOUR DECISION.
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
DO THIS FOR ME.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.767
- I DON'T?
- NO.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.270
YOU'LL DO IT FOR US.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.273
( mouths )

03:28.809 --> 03:31.011
( crowd cheering
on TV )

03:31.044 --> 03:34.548
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:34.582 --> 03:37.518
WATCHING ALL MY OLD
WAMMY VIDEOS WITH TEDDY.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.420
TEDDY?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.755
YOU'RE MISSING
ALL THE GOOD PARTS.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.558
WHAT AM I SAYING?
THEY'RE ALL GOOD PARTS.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.660
EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.462
REMEMBER THIS, BOB?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.464
OH, HOW CAN I FORGET?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.733
THE NIGHT
THE NORTH HIGH BARBARIAN
TOOK YOU DOWN.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.005
OH!

03:58.038 --> 04:00.007
I HATED THAT GUY.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.644
EVEN FOR A BARBARIAN,
HE WAS A JERK.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.380
Bob:
YOU REMEMBER THE TIME
THOSE GOONS FROM NORTH HIGH

04:06.414 --> 04:08.382
GRABBED YOU, TOOK YOU
ON A LITTLE JOYRIDE?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.818
Amy:
EVERY WAMMY'S
WORST NIGHTMARE.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.820
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T EVEN WATCH IT.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.688
IT'S TOO PAINFUL
EVEN NOW.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.690
OH, WAIT,
THIS IS A GOOD PART.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.427
COME HERE, KIDS.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.429
Bob:
RECOGNIZE THAT GUY?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.564
Gabe:
IS THAT P.J.?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.433
NOPE, THAT'S ME.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.670
YOU MEAN THAT THIN GUY
WITH A FULL HEAD OF HEAR
IS YOU?

04:29.703 --> 04:30.771
YEP.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.773
SO THAT MEANS

04:32.806 --> 04:34.808
I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE YOU
WHEN I GET OLD.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.445
OH, I STOPPED LOOKING
LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS 25.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.313
BUT THAT'S ONLY
EIGHT YEARS FROM NOW.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.715
ENJOY IT
WHILE YOU GOT IT.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.551
( laughs )

04:43.584 --> 04:45.819
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D MARRY YOUNG.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.591
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

04:50.624 --> 04:53.861
NOT BEING OUT THERE.
WHAT TAPE IS SHE UP TO?

04:53.894 --> 04:58.499
VOLUME THREE,
"WAMMY BEHIND THE MASK."

04:58.532 --> 05:01.469
DAD, SHE WANTS ME
TO TRY OUT.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.837
OH, BOY. I KNEW
THIS DAY WAS COMING.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.839
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE A MASCOT.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.709
I'LL BE THE BIGGEST
DORK IN SCHOOL.
YOU GOTTA HELP ME OUT HERE.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.078
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- CAN'T YOU TALK TO HER?

05:11.111 --> 05:13.481
( laughs )
YEAH, OKAY.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.483
I'LL DO THAT, HONEY,
RIGHT AFTER I MENTION

05:15.516 --> 05:17.451
THAT HER FAVORITE PANTS
MAKE HER LOOK FAT.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.820
- WHO LOOKS FAT?
- MY MOTHER.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.924
( playing loudly )

05:25.893 --> 05:26.727
( laughs )

05:26.760 --> 05:29.897
HEY, WE ALMOST ENDED
AT THE SAME TIME.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.600
ONLY BECAUSE I DROPPED
ONE OF MY STICKS.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.369
DID YOU SEE CHARLIE?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.371
SHE WAS TOTALLY
ROCKING OUT.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.907
- IS SHE AMAZING OR WHAT?
- SHE'S OKAY.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.142
OKAY? WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.144
YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS
GOING ON AND ON

05:44.177 --> 05:46.480
ABOUT WHAT A SUPER BABY
CHARLIE IS.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.782
MAN, I GOT A NEPHEW MASON.
NOW THAT'S A BABY.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.484
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT MASON?

05:50.518 --> 05:54.588
WELL, FOR ONE THING
HE'S A STUD AT PEEK-A-BOO.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.857
COME ON, CHARLIE
CAN PLAY PEEK-A-BOO
WITH HER EYES CLOSED.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.493
THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY
PEEK-A-BOO.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.762
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

06:01.795 --> 06:04.632
WELL, MASON'S AN INCREDIBLY
FAST CRAWLER.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.667
NOT AS FAST AS CHARLIE.
SHE'S LIKE A CAT.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.736
MASON SLEEPS AT NIGHT
WITH A RABBIT--

06:08.769 --> 06:10.938
NOT A STUFFED ONE,
ONE THAT HE CAUGHT.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.807
SO YOU THINK
MASON'S FASTER.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.543
I THINK CHARLIE'S
FASTER.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.545
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO SETTLE THIS.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.547
WE CHALLENGE YOU
TO A BABY RACE.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.914
OH, IT IS ON.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.785
AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE SORRY

06:24.818 --> 06:28.556
BECAUSE MASON
RHYMES WITH RACIN'.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.558
WE'LL TAKE OUR CHANCES.

06:30.591 --> 06:34.194
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE
A GOOD LOOK AT THIS,

06:34.227 --> 06:37.431
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL
YOU AND MASON ARE
GONNA BE SEEING.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.839
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE TRYING OUT FOR WAMMY.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.208
THE WHOLE IDEA
BEHIND THIS FRIENDSHIP

06:48.241 --> 06:50.210
WAS FOR YOU TO MAKE ME
MORE POPULAR,

06:50.243 --> 06:52.846
NOT LESS POPULAR.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.583
OKAY, RELAX.
I SAID I HAD TO TRY OUT.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.951
I DIDN'T SAY
I HAD TO DO WELL.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.854
( blows whistle )

07:00.888 --> 07:03.691
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.
TIME FOR WAMMY TRYOUTS.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.594
- FIRST UP, TEDDY DUNCAN.
- I'M TEDDY.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.596
DAUGHTER OF AMY DUNCAN,

07:08.629 --> 07:10.998
THE SECOND FINEST WAMMY
THIS SCHOOL HAS EVER SEEN.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.767
- WHO WAS THE FIRST?
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT HER.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.939
LET'S DO THIS THING!

07:18.972 --> 07:21.208
ALL RIGHT, DUNCAN,
LET ME SET THE SCENE FOR YOU.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.776
THE TEAM IS DOWN
BY EIGHT.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.613
YOU NEED TO GET
THAT CROWD JAZZED UP.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.048
NOW GIVE ME
WHAT YOU GOT!

07:29.917 --> 07:33.621
COME ON, CROWD,
JAZZ UP.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.624
I AM NOT FEELING THAT.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.759
MOVING ON.
HOW'S YOUR DANCING?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.794
YOU TELL ME.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.734
AHH!

07:51.271 --> 07:53.674
AHH! AHH!

07:58.712 --> 08:00.047
WHAT WAS THAT?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.516
THAT WAS
INTERPRETIVE DANCING.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.518
THAT PIECE WAS CALLED
"SPRING DAY."

08:04.552 --> 08:06.720
I CAN ALSO SHOW YOU
"GLOBAL WARMING"

08:06.754 --> 08:08.722
OR "DOGS WOW!"

08:08.756 --> 08:10.624
DANCING--
QUESTION MARK.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.792
QUESTION MARK?

08:11.825 --> 08:15.829
THAT STUCK,
EXCLAMATION POINT!

08:15.863 --> 08:17.831
ALL RIGHT, DUNCAN,
ONE MORE THING.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.068
TAKE THAT FLAG THERE
AND FIRE UP THAT CROWD.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.911
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT FLAG.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.280
( whistles )
DUNCAN, THAT WAS

08:33.313 --> 08:35.683
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE,
ALL OF IT.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.551
IT'S OKAY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.052
CONGRATULATIONS, WAMMY.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.888
BUT I WAS AWFUL.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.923
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE WHO TRIED OUT.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.925
SEE YOU AT THE BIG GAME.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.961
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.664
WELL, IN HINDSIGHT,

08:50.698 --> 08:52.666
I GUESS WE SHOULD
HAVE NOTICED

08:52.700 --> 08:55.669
THAT NOBODY ELSE
WAS HERE.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.708
HEY, GABE,
DO ME A FAVOR.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.710
CHECK THE BACK
OF MY HEAD.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.712
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M GOING BALD?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.847
WELL, IT'S TEMPTING
TO SAY YES,

09:06.880 --> 09:09.617
SO YES.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.718
SERIOUSLY?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.586
NO.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.322
YOUR HAIR IS AS FULL
AND STUPID-LOOKING AS EVER.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.758
THANK YOU.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.960
YOU'RE A GOOD BROTHER.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.095
IS THIS WHY YOU WANTED ME
TO COME DOWN HERE?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.097
NO, IT IS TIME

09:24.131 --> 09:25.966
TO TRAIN CHARLIE
FOR THE BABY RACE.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.768
CHARLIE?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.003
I THOUGHT THE BABY RACE
WAS GONNA BE

09:30.037 --> 09:32.005
YOU AND EMMETT
IN DIAPERS.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.808
NOW I'VE LOST
INTEREST.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.877
OKAY, TURBO BABY,

09:36.910 --> 09:39.647
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.682
HA!

09:44.785 --> 09:47.621
( giggling )

09:47.655 --> 09:49.990
LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT
A LITTLE WORK TO DO.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.059
( upbeat music playing )

10:39.072 --> 10:42.075
THERE SHE IS.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.911
HI, MOM.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.814
HI, WAMMY.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.784
OH, DID MISS COVINGTON
CALL YOU?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.853
NO, IT'S ON THE SCHOOL
WEBSITE.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.823
ALREADY?
THERE'S NOT A PICTURE UP
OF ME, IS THERE?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.825
THERE IS NOW.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.694
I JUST SENT ONE IN.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.796
AND I'VE GOT
A BIG SURPRISE FOR YOU.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.198
TA-DAH!

11:05.232 --> 11:07.134
I KEPT IT AT THE END
OF MY LAST SEASON.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.969
IT'S BEEN SITTING
IN THE BACK OF THE SHED

11:09.002 --> 11:10.838
FOR THE LAST
20 YEARS.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.106
THEN I CAN'T WAIT
TO PUT IT ON MY HEAD.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.108
COME ON.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.779
GET IT ON THERE, GIRL.
WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO.

11:18.812 --> 11:22.115
TEDDY, YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.

11:22.149 --> 11:25.118
SMELLS LIKE ARMPIT
IN HERE.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.487
I KNOW.
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.489
OKAY, I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU

11:29.522 --> 11:31.491
SOME OF MY SIGNATURE
WAMMY MOVES.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.761
( dance music playing )

11:35.796 --> 11:37.965
YOU GOTTA
HIT IT HARD, GIRL.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.903
NOW YOU GOTTA
KEEP IN RHYTHM.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.806
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
IS WITH THE WAMMY WIGGLE.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.175
A-FIVE, SIX,
SEVEN, EIGHT!

11:53.881 --> 11:56.884
NOW WE'RE GONNA BUILD
ON THAT MOVE.
YOU READY?

11:56.917 --> 11:59.286
WE'RE GONNA
GET OUR STEAM UP.
IT GOES LIKE THIS.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.989
WHOO, AH-WHOO,
AH-WHOO.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.025
NO NO, SWEETHEART.
YOU LOST YOUR WIGGLE.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.094
IF YOU TRY
TO GET YOUR STEAM UP
WITHOUT THE WIGGLE,

12:07.127 --> 12:09.029
YOU'LL JUST LOOK
LIKE A FOOL OUT THERE.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.966
SURE WOULDN'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.235
NEXT I WANT YOU
TO JUMP UP IN THE AIR

12:15.268 --> 12:17.237
AND YOU GOTTA LAND
WITH YOUR ARMS FORMING

12:17.270 --> 12:20.941
A BIG "W".

12:20.974 --> 12:22.943
( chuckles )
THAT'S REALLY CUTE.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.945
NO NO NO, TEDDY.
IT'S ALL IN THE ELBOWS.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.880
YOU'RE NOT VAMMY.
YOU'RE NOT HAMMY.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.215
YOU'RE WAMMY!

12:29.850 --> 12:31.819
OKAY, GIRL, YOU DO IT.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.121
NOW DIG DEEP
AND LET YOUR FIRE FLY!

12:34.154 --> 12:36.323
I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.059
SURE YOU CAN.
YOU JUST GOTTA PRACTICE.
WAMMY WASN'T BUILT IN A DAY.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.261
( turns off music )
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.195
WHAT?

12:42.229 --> 12:45.933
I DON'T WANT TO BE HAMMY
OR VAMMY OR WAMMY!

12:45.966 --> 12:48.235
I QUIT.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.924
( knocks )
HEY, WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR MOTHER?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.860
I TOLD HER I DIDN'T
WANT TO BE A WAMMY.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.027
I WAS JUST BEING HONEST
WITH HER.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.230
HONEST?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

13:17.264 --> 13:19.199
HOW'S SHE TAKING IT?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.968
NOT WELL.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.970
SHE'S LYING IN BED
WITH HER WAMMY HEAD ON,

13:23.003 --> 13:24.938
STUFFING TISSUES
UP HER SNOUT.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.173
I DON'T KNOW.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.976
MAYBE BEING WAMMY
WAS COOL WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE IN SCHOOL--

13:29.009 --> 13:31.044
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IT WAS NEVER COOL.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.380
YOUR MOM JUST
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.916
HOW COULD SHE
NOT KNOW THAT?

13:35.949 --> 13:38.085
DID SHE SPEND
ALL FOUR YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL
WEARING THAT GIANT HEAD?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.220
IT WAS HER
YEARBOOK PICTURE.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.593
LOOK, TEDDY, IF YOU DON'T
GO TO THAT BIG GAME

13:46.626 --> 13:48.595
THERE'S GONNA BE
NO WAMMY,

13:48.628 --> 13:51.264
AND THAT IS GONNA BREAK
YOUR MOTHER'S HEART.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.867
DAD, I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOOK STUPID.

13:53.901 --> 13:57.070
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA LET YOUR MOM
AND EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL DOWN

13:57.104 --> 13:59.072
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
OF LOOKING STUPID?

13:59.106 --> 14:01.975
YES, THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

14:02.009 --> 14:06.079
HONEY, I'M NOT GONNA
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.981
BUT JUST REMEMBER,

14:08.015 --> 14:09.983
SOMETIMES
THE RIGHT DECISION

14:10.017 --> 14:12.285
CAN FEEL LIKE
THE WRONG DECISION.

14:12.319 --> 14:15.222
AND THE HARD DECISION
CAN BE THE BEST DECISION.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.090
BUT THE GOOD DECISION--

14:17.124 --> 14:21.028
OH, COME ON,
PLEASE JUST BE WAMMY!

14:31.071 --> 14:33.340
HEY, WAMMY.
GOING SOMEWHERE?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.177
EVER BEEN TO NORTH HIGH?
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING

14:37.210 --> 14:39.279
WE COULD ALL TAKE
A LITTLE TRIP.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.983
IT'S ABOUT TO CHARGE.
GET IT!

14:45.052 --> 14:48.088
OH, THIS IS
THE GREATEST PRANK EVER!

14:56.997 --> 14:59.933
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT NERD IS WEARING
THE COSTUME THIS YEAR.

15:04.304 --> 15:08.008
DUDE, WAMMY'S OLD.

15:08.041 --> 15:12.145
WAMMY IS NOT OLD.
WAMMY HAD FOUR KIDS.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.187
( crowd cheering )

15:20.220 --> 15:22.289
I DIDN'T SEE HER.
YOUR MOM'S NOT IN THERE.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.291
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.493
SHE'S THE ONLY REASON
I'M DOING THIS STUPID THING.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.361
WELL, LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE.

15:28.395 --> 15:32.132
DUNCAN, THE GYM'S
THIS WAY.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.202
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.971
NOT YOU-- WAMMY.
PUT ON THE HEAD.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.010
OH, YOU LOOK SO MUCH
LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.012
( whistle blows )

15:45.045 --> 15:47.114
SHOWTIME!

15:47.147 --> 15:50.083
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU, T.
GOT YOUR BACK.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.553
( crowd cheering )

16:05.165 --> 16:08.568
GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR BABIES.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.439
GO!

16:17.410 --> 16:18.511
AND THEY'RE OFF!

16:18.545 --> 16:21.114
OH, LOOK, MASON.
YUMMY YUMMY.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.117
COME TO THE PEACHES.

16:24.151 --> 16:28.255
COME TO MOMMY.
COME TO MOMMY.

16:28.288 --> 16:33.026
MASON GOT THE EARLY LEAD.
CHARLIE'S BRINGING UP
THE REAR.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.263
LOOK AT MY BOY GO.
HE'S BARELY BREAKING
A SWEAT.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.298
AT THE HALFWAY MARK IT'S MASON,
FOLLOWED BY CHARLIE.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.568
COME ON, CHARLIE.
YOU CAN DO IT.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.271
COMING DOWN THE HOME STRETCH.
IT'S STILL MASON IN THE LEAD.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.274
COME ON, CHARLIE.
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.048
AND THE WINNER IS...

16:55.082 --> 16:57.450
CHARLIE!

17:06.493 --> 17:10.130
OH MY GOSH.
CHARLIE, YOU JUST TOOK
YOUR FIRST STEPS.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.199
NOT YOUR BEST DAY,
MASON.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.235
WHAT WENT WRONG
OUT THERE?

17:15.268 --> 17:18.271
WE'LL BE BACK
WHEN WE LEARN HOW TO WALK.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.149
CAN YOU PLEASE
TAKE ME BACK TO THE GYM?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.584
NO WAY.
NOT TILL THE GAME'S OVER.

17:31.618 --> 17:35.255
OKAY, CAN YOU
TAKE ME HOME THEN?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.257
I DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT THE GAME, GUYS.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.492
NORTH HIGH, SOUTH HIGH--
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

17:39.526 --> 17:42.095
ONLY ONE THING--

17:42.129 --> 17:44.397
- NORTH HIGH RULES!
- YEAH!

17:44.431 --> 17:46.399
YEAH, BABY!
WHOO!

17:46.433 --> 17:48.368
OKAY, WHATEVER.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.370
LOOK, IF WE'RE GONNA
DRIVE AROUND IN CIRCLES
FOR HOURS,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.505
- CAN I AT LEAST
USE THE BATHROOM?
- CAN'T YOU HOLD IT?

17:52.539 --> 17:55.375
I'VE HAD FOUR KIDS.
I PEE WHEN I SNEEZE.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.510
GROSS.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.146
PULL OVER.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.150
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.128
AGH!

18:15.162 --> 18:17.630
SOUTH HIGH RULES!

18:19.166 --> 18:21.168
( laughs )

18:23.703 --> 18:25.705
SAFETY FIRST.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.577
RAM ON THE LAM!

18:32.545 --> 18:34.547
- ( whistle blows )
- ( crowd groans )

18:36.949 --> 18:38.651
STARING AT MY BALDNESS

18:38.685 --> 18:40.520
AIN'T GONNA STOP
YOUR BALDNESS.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.590
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.592
WOULD YOU STOP FOCUSING
ON THE NEGATIVES?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.595
- THINK ABOUT THE POSITIVES.
- LIKE WHAT?

18:48.628 --> 18:52.232
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LARGE
BASEBALL CAP COLLECTION.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.667
YOU'RE GONNA SAVE
ON SHAMPOO.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.536
AND WITH THE MONEY
YOU SAVE ON SHAMPOO

18:56.569 --> 18:59.172
YOU CAN BUY
MORE BASEBALL CAPS.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.509
HERE COMES TEDDY.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.611
( dance music playing,
crowd cheering )

19:34.541 --> 19:36.776
( crowd booing )

20:37.604 --> 20:39.639
THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.475
WAMMY'S MY BEST
FRIEND.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.546
- WHOO! YEAH!
- WHOO!

20:46.579 --> 20:49.349
( crowd chanting )
WAMMY! WAMMY! WAMMY!

20:57.557 --> 21:00.793
Well, Charlie, looks like
we both took baby steps today.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.495
You walked
for the first time

21:02.529 --> 21:05.665
and I did something
and wound up liking it.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.700
And I hope
you like it too

21:07.734 --> 21:10.703
because you're already
on your way.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.038
Yeah!

21:12.071 --> 21:14.807
Wammy jammy!

21:14.841 --> 21:17.477
Whoo!
Good luck, Charlie.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.617
Teddy:
COME ON, P.J.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.454
GET DOWN HERE.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.056
ALL RIGHT, COMING.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.692
CHILAX.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.729
OH, NO.

21:36.763 --> 21:39.566
OH, NO.
IT'S HAPPENING.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.402
NO, I'M NOT READY.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.870
NO!

21:43.903 --> 21:45.905
NO-O-O-O!

21:47.840 --> 21:49.676
( sighs )

21:49.709 --> 21:51.711
- BAD DREAM?
- YEAH.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.647
OH, HEY,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.849
HERE'S THE FIRST ONE
MY DAD GAVE ME.
