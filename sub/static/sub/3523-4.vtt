01:08:58.057 --> 01:09:01.254
- The guinea welcome wagon.
- This is for you.

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:05.894
Carmela's bringing something nice to
the housewarming for Ginny.

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:12.126
This is the Great Room.
I don't see what's so great.

01:09:12.377 --> 01:09:16.165
It's mediocre. We got a
living room right over there.

01:09:18.057 --> 01:09:20.127
I didn't know you were moving.

01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:25.286
Ginny wanted to be near her sisters,
you know and the schools out here.

01:09:25.897 --> 01:09:29.606
We were with Carmine.
You never mentioned this place.

01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:31.933
It's not his favorite subject.

01:09:32.176 --> 01:09:35.886
It's what, half an hour,
40 minutes over the bridge?

01:09:36.497 --> 01:09:38.727
Why didn't you say you were moving?

01:09:38.977 --> 01:09:41.332
- Why?
- I gotta find out second hand?

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.250
You care?
You working in a tollbooth?

01:09:44.457 --> 01:09:47.926
Besides, I already got
the condo in Point Pleasant.

01:09:48.577 --> 01:09:51.455
- You should have told me.
- I'm telling you now.

01:09:51.657 --> 01:09:56.128
This is a place to live. I got no
intention of sticking my beak in.

01:09:56.337 --> 01:10:00.649
I mean, there's our family
and then there's the Soprano family.

01:10:02.057 --> 01:10:04.525
Don't I get to see the rest of this?

01:10:04.737 --> 01:10:07.376
You can help me unstick
this rain bird.

01:10:07.577 --> 01:10:11.172
I'm a stranger in
a strange land out here.

01:10:22.297 --> 01:10:25.016
Look at this pair.

01:10:25.377 --> 01:10:28.449
How many Neapolitans
to screw in a light bulb?

01:10:28.697 --> 01:10:33.771
There's only candles in Naples.
The cardinal controls that racket.

01:10:33.977 --> 01:10:36.013
That's a good one.

01:10:36.257 --> 01:10:38.213
Use it on your paesans.

01:10:38.417 --> 01:10:41.170
We don't have those bulb jokes.
They don't translate.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.055
Oh.

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:46.370
Tony, I go get a cappuccino.

Two thousand of that is mine.

Sand monkey on 17 is
holding out on us.

01:10:52.097 --> 01:10:55.931
- So you put his brother in an ambulance?
- He said a bad word.

01:10:56.177 --> 01:11:00.090
Why would you take Jackie's kid
on something like that?

01:11:00.297 --> 01:11:03.812
He's got to know how it works.
Kid's got a chip.

01:11:04.017 --> 01:11:06.167
23 and still living at home?

01:11:06.377 --> 01:11:10.336
So he can keep an eye on
the prick that's banging his mom.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:14.168
No matter how nice I am,
he still hates me.

01:11:14.377 --> 01:11:17.687
I got a daughter that age.
It's all a mystery.

01:11:17.897 --> 01:11:18.932
Amen.

01:11:19.177 --> 01:11:22.294
Being a parent,
that's the hardest job.

01:11:22.497 --> 01:11:24.647
It's harder than this other shit.

01:11:24.857 --> 01:11:30.648
- Like my first marriage and my kid...
- I got news you're not gonna like.

01:11:30.857 --> 01:11:34.816
- I'm putting him in as captain.
- What?

01:11:37.497 --> 01:11:39.647
No.

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:45.328
- Fucking Gigi, are you shitting me?
- I'm sorry.

01:11:46.297 --> 01:11:51.007
This shit with the Arab?
I went too far. I'll take care of it.

01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:52.616
This isn't the first.

01:11:52.817 --> 01:11:58.016
At least tell the truth. You want your
own there to spy on the Aprile crew.

01:11:58.217 --> 01:12:00.447
Yeah. But I shouldn't have to.

01:12:01.097 --> 01:12:04.885
You got bad tendencies.
I sympathize because I do too.

01:12:05.097 --> 01:12:08.806
You partnering with
Joe Brooklyn on shit at the port.

01:12:09.017 --> 01:12:10.166
A bum decision.

The bottom line speaks.
I'm earning my ass.

01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:15.613

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:38.053
I've been thinking about
your course of therapy.

01:12:38.257 --> 01:12:40.407
You're the doctor.

01:12:41.977 --> 01:12:45.856
You're ready to move on to
behavior modification therapy.

01:12:46.257 --> 01:12:49.408
What's that mean?
Talk to somebody else?

01:12:50.217 --> 01:12:54.005
Is this because of what
happened last time?

01:12:55.377 --> 01:13:00.326
Look, I'm sorry. But like you said,
it's hard to think about that stuff.

01:13:00.537 --> 01:13:03.927
- It took how long to even remember?
- I realize that.

01:13:04.137 --> 01:13:08.528
You know, you're unbelievable.
I ask you to get serious in here.

When it gets hard,
you pawn me off on somebody else.

I'm just introducing the idea.
Something for you to think about.

Yes, he was here earlier today.

01:13:32.457 --> 01:13:36.416
Yes, we talked about
behavior mod, but...

01:13:36.617 --> 01:13:39.609
Maybe you could.

01:13:40.057 --> 01:13:43.015
Listen, I told you
I would discharge him...

01:13:43.217 --> 01:13:47.608
...and I will, in my own good time.

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:52.567

01:37:53.097 --> 01:37:57.648
- Was Richard anywhere in all this?
- No.

01:37:58.417 --> 01:38:00.772
Oh, my God. The dog.

01:38:01.017 --> 01:38:03.167
- What?
- A rottweiler, Elliot.

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:06.050
Big head. Massive shoulders.

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:11.007
Descendent of the dog used by
the Roman armies to guard their camps.

01:38:11.217 --> 01:38:13.094
- I didn't know that.
- Digging?

01:38:13.297 --> 01:38:16.687
Who do I dig with?
And who's dangerous?

01:38:16.897 --> 01:38:22.096
Who could I sic on that son of a bitch
to tear him to shreds?

01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:26.690
- Oh.
- Let me tell you something.

01:38:26.937 --> 01:38:32.136
No feeling has ever been so sweet
as to see that pig beg...

01:38:32.537 --> 01:38:34.687
...and plead and scream for life.

01:38:34.937 --> 01:38:39.488
Because the justice system
is fucked up, Elliot.

01:38:39.737 --> 01:38:43.286
Richard's attorney is
in this at $300 an hour.

01:38:43.537 --> 01:38:47.052
Meanwhile, that
employee of the month cocksucker...

01:38:47.257 --> 01:38:51.853
...is back on the street,
and who's gonna stop him? You?

01:38:52.937 --> 01:38:54.848
Jennifer...

01:38:56.537 --> 01:39:00.576
- Civilization...
- Don't worry.

01:39:00.817 --> 01:39:03.809
I'm not going to break
the social compact.

01:39:04.337 --> 01:39:08.888
But that's not saying there's not a
certain satisfaction in knowing...

01:39:09.097 --> 01:39:13.488
...that I could have that asshole
squashed like a bug.

01:39:13.737 --> 01:39:15.216
If I wanted.

01:39:26.017 --> 01:39:28.053
What happened?

01:39:30.457 --> 01:39:32.129
Janice?

01:39:34.137 --> 01:39:38.176
I can't drive.
And they broke three ribs.

01:39:38.377 --> 01:39:43.576
What did I tell you? I told you
not to mess with those people.

01:39:43.817 --> 01:39:46.809
I was supposed to be married
at this point.

01:39:47.017 --> 01:39:49.690
- Yeah? So?
- The man I loved died.

01:39:49.897 --> 01:39:51.535
[RATTLING]

01:39:55.537 --> 01:39:59.246
This is all I fucking need.
Thanks, Janice.

01:40:00.177 --> 01:40:01.735
- What?
- What do you mean?

01:40:01.937 --> 01:40:04.167
- They slapped my sister around.
- Oh.

01:40:04.377 --> 01:40:07.449
I have to get payback.
It's always something.

01:40:07.657 --> 01:40:11.445
Every time I hear your voice,
I know it's gonna cost me.

01:40:11.657 --> 01:40:16.333
Time. Money. You never do anything
to simplify my life.

01:40:16.537 --> 01:40:22.487
I stole a woman's prosthetic leg.
When did I get like this?

01:40:22.697 --> 01:40:26.292
- You really wanna know?
- When Richie died.

01:40:26.497 --> 01:40:30.854
Till that time, I was functioning
at a very high level.

01:40:32.657 --> 01:40:35.376
There's only one trajectory for me.

01:40:36.537 --> 01:40:38.050
Really?

01:40:38.857 --> 01:40:42.645
- God.
- You see what I mean?

01:40:42.857 --> 01:40:46.293
All this soul-searching,
it's always on my dime.

01:40:46.497 --> 01:40:49.250
I've hit bottom, Tony.

01:40:50.337 --> 01:40:55.536
But it's odd because
I feel born again in the Lord.

01:40:57.697 --> 01:41:02.248
- Hm.
- And I prayed to God and I asked him...

01:41:02.457 --> 01:41:07.247
...to forgive Svetlana
for what she's done.

01:41:08.257 --> 01:41:13.126
We've been here before. With Vishnu
and Richard-fucking-Alpert...

01:41:13.337 --> 01:41:17.091
...and the Coyote Spirit.
You know what it always spells?

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:21.967
Trouble for the rest of us.
So put your fucking clothes on.

01:41:22.217 --> 01:41:25.368
Seriously. I gotta get out of here.

01:41:25.617 --> 01:41:30.816
I give myself up utterly
and totally to God.

01:41:31.657 --> 01:41:34.046
If this is the bottom.

01:41:34.257 --> 01:41:35.485
If not...

01:41:36.497 --> 01:41:37.646
You can go now.

01:41:37.857 --> 01:41:41.088
Billing needs to see you.
Follow the blue line.

01:41:52.657 --> 01:41:54.648
Carmela.

01:41:55.737 --> 01:41:58.456
- Gorgeous as ever.
- My God, this house.

01:41:58.697 --> 01:41:59.812
You got one.

01:42:03.097 --> 01:42:07.329
Move to Jersey, but maybe take
a little bit of a halfway step?

01:42:07.537 --> 01:42:10.051
Fucking wife of mine.

01:42:16.177 --> 01:42:17.496
Gentlemen.

01:42:17.737 --> 01:42:22.288
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

01:42:22.497 --> 01:42:24.613
He's obsessed with Gladiator.

01:42:24.817 --> 01:42:29.493
Come on, it's a great fucking film.
"Strength and honor."

01:42:29.737 --> 01:42:33.696
Scotch and soda. Long as you're
on the way to the bar.

01:42:33.937 --> 01:42:35.290
Ball breaker.

01:42:35.537 --> 01:42:37.368
J & B, right, Ton?

01:42:37.617 --> 01:42:40.654
T, what do you think
a place like this...

01:42:40.857 --> 01:42:43.530
...set John back?
- Who gives a shit?

01:42:43.737 --> 01:42:46.410
Landscape alone's gotta be
100, 150 G's.

01:42:46.617 --> 01:42:50.246
- To keep up this lawn...
- Property taxes. Gotta pay those.

01:42:50.457 --> 01:42:51.446
SILVIO:
Taxes.

01:42:51.657 --> 01:42:54.569
Use the money to
fix air traffic control?

01:42:54.817 --> 01:42:56.614
GIGl:
We should fight terrorism.

01:42:56.817 --> 01:43:00.446
How about that stampede in
Zimbabwe? Soccer game.

01:43:00.657 --> 01:43:04.252
GIGl:
No assigned seating. Always a problem.

01:43:20.137 --> 01:43:23.447
You're not using the cane anymore.

01:43:29.697 --> 01:43:34.646
Been making my list.

01:43:35.537 --> 01:43:40.452
Even bought a little notebook.

01:43:41.097 --> 01:43:43.657
Good. That's good.

01:43:44.977 --> 01:43:50.005
I've been thinking about your behavior
therapy idea. You got a point.

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:55.167
I could use some help with a few
things. If they can help me there...

01:43:55.377 --> 01:43:56.969
...I should go there.

01:43:57.177 --> 01:43:58.166
No.

01:43:58.617 --> 01:44:02.496
You sure about that?
Because the last couple of times...

01:44:02.737 --> 01:44:07.253
...I've been getting the feeling
that you're giving me the boot.

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:19.248
What's the matter?

01:44:19.457 --> 01:44:21.652
Hey, come on.

01:44:21.857 --> 01:44:23.848
What did I do?

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:26.252
Come on, huh?

01:44:26.617 --> 01:44:28.812
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:44:28.977 --> 01:44:30.854
Come on.

01:44:32.657 --> 01:44:36.570
Now, what did I do? What's the matter?

01:44:36.817 --> 01:44:38.887
Tell me. What's the matter?

01:44:39.137 --> 01:44:40.775
Go sit over there.

01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:43.531
We'll do this.

01:44:43.737 --> 01:44:45.250
Go.

01:44:47.137 --> 01:44:50.846
It's just my knee.

01:45:01.857 --> 01:45:04.246
It's okay. Go on.

01:45:07.137 --> 01:45:08.650
What?

01:45:09.657 --> 01:45:12.649
I mean, you wanna say something?

01:45:19.497 --> 01:45:20.646
No.
