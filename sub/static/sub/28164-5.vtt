00:11.803 --> 00:14.514
[chanting] <i>One of us, one of us!</i>
<i>One of us, one of us!</i>

00:14.597 --> 00:17.225
<i>One of us, one of us!</i>
<i>One of us, one of us!</i>

00:17.308 --> 00:19.602
One of us, one of us!

00:19.686 --> 00:21.688
-[can crackles]
-[Lilith cheers]

00:21.771 --> 00:23.773
Long is the road and short is the life.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.026
Jack Morton, welcome home.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.695
Now, let's kick evil's ass!

00:28.778 --> 00:31.364
[all cheer]

00:50.967 --> 00:52.135
Hey.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.386
Shh.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.598
-I thought we were going to fight evil?
-[Randall] And we will.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.184
When there's evil to fight.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.729
Until then, will you all please shut up
so I can work on my essay?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.522
What are you writing about?

01:05.106 --> 01:07.984
The feminist metaphor
of Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:10.820
Let me guess. The monster's a clitoris.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.282
Yes.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.452
So, what? We're just gonna sit around?
It's already been a week.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.954
Jack, we can't go all "Justice League"

01:20.038 --> 01:22.040
until our Spidey-senses tingle.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.374
[Hamish] No. I told you once.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.419
-You can't mix DC and Marvel.
-DC and Marvel. Yeah.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.005
Shouldn't we at least go out
and look for evil doers?

01:31.674 --> 01:33.760
You did not just say "evil doers."

01:33.843 --> 01:36.805
Look, Jack, being a Knight
is a sacred duty.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.139
[Randall] Doody.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.810
And I know you're anxious to get in
on the game, but waiting is part of--

01:41.893 --> 01:45.313
-[ringing sounds]
-Finally!

01:47.315 --> 01:49.234
We're not going to check that out?

01:49.317 --> 01:51.444
It's probably just your friend
stealing another pizza.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.780
Or maybe it's something evil
killing people?

01:53.863 --> 01:56.991
-Guys, I made my decision.
-Oh, come on, Lame-ish.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.077
Once around the campus.
What harm can it do?

01:59.494 --> 02:01.287
Anything to shut him up.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.123
[Jack groans]

02:04.707 --> 02:05.542
Where you going?

02:05.625 --> 02:07.502
Ah, is Little Jackie shy?

02:07.585 --> 02:08.962
I'm an only child!

02:09.754 --> 02:11.422
-[muted laughs]
-[door bangs shut]

02:11.548 --> 02:14.384
-[sound of thunder]
-[sound of rain]

02:14.467 --> 02:17.428
-[woman's soft moaning]
-[kissing]

02:18.721 --> 02:21.516
[sound of running feet]

02:21.599 --> 02:23.601
[woman's soft moaning]

02:24.310 --> 02:25.645
[low snarling]

02:26.479 --> 02:28.731
-[woman's moaning]
-[man's muffled yells]

02:28.815 --> 02:31.317
-[man's yells]
-[ripping of flesh]

02:31.401 --> 02:34.696
-[woman's soft snarling]
-[sound of thunder]

02:34.779 --> 02:35.864
[breaking glass]

02:35.947 --> 02:37.824
[woman's demonic scream]

02:38.032 --> 02:42.162
[snarling]

02:50.253 --> 02:53.131
[Edward] You know, I've been thinking
about our place in the world,

02:53.965 --> 02:56.759
and I see us as so lucky

02:57.969 --> 03:01.306
that it makes me wonder,
maybe we should be giving back more.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.518
Hell, we all want something.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.730
Maybe it's control of a corporation,

03:09.272 --> 03:10.398
maybe it's sex...

03:10.481 --> 03:11.691
[muted laughter]

03:12.025 --> 03:12.859
fame,

03:13.735 --> 03:14.652
power.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.073
Professional respect.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.536
Or maybe it's just
good old-fashioned revenge.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.080
The point is,

03:26.873 --> 03:30.293
I think we can have it all
and serve the greater good

03:31.085 --> 03:32.337
and ourselves,

03:32.962 --> 03:34.714
because I have found the way.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.969
The Vade Maecum Infernal.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.890
With all due respect, Magus,

03:43.973 --> 03:46.476
The Vade Maecum Infernal
is incredibly dangerous.

03:46.601 --> 03:50.521
Every practitioner who's gone
looking for it has wound up...

03:51.105 --> 03:51.981
disappeared,

03:52.482 --> 03:53.691
dismembered...

03:54.901 --> 03:55.735
dead.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.280
[man's voice] If the Grand Magus seeks
to resurrect The Vade Maecum,

03:59.822 --> 04:03.576
then a Temple Magus has no place
questioning his ambition.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.579
[Vera] I am merely suggesting
a little restraint.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.833
Once you start down this road,
there is no turning back.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.502
Then we move forward.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.629
There are two sections left.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.341
This order will find both of them,
and together

04:18.925 --> 04:21.469
we will build a world
like you've never seen.

04:23.304 --> 04:28.142
<i>"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings.</i>

04:28.768 --> 04:32.939
<i>Look on my works,</i>
<i>ye mighty, and despair."</i>

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
That's... that's you.
That's how you sound.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.653
Renée.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.905
Long time no see.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.032
Not long enough. [coughs]

04:44.409 --> 04:45.535
Oh, Eddie.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.120
Don't be coy.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.455
You knew this day would come.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.584
Or should I cut open
one of your wax figures...

04:54.836 --> 04:56.212
and show you the future?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.464
Necromancy is forbidden here.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.634
You know the rules,
we wrote them because of you.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.677
Now, get out.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.221
Oh, lighten up, Sour Patch.
Where's your school spirit?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.472
It's homecoming.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.849
Go, Timber Wolves.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.351
Grand Magus, we can't allow this...

05:12.228 --> 05:13.896
creature to stay.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.816
Surprise, surprise.
Professor Hemmings has an opinion.

05:16.899 --> 05:20.695
[Prof Hemmings] You and your sister's
perverted ambitions defiled The Order.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.741
You nearly started a war. We should
have killed you when we had the chance.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.825
[Renée] Oh.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.744
I'd like to see you try.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.370
[soft ringing]

05:29.454 --> 05:30.955
[low boom]

05:32.749 --> 05:34.125
[Prof Hemmings gasps]

05:36.502 --> 05:42.175
[Prof Hemmings softly snorting]

05:43.051 --> 05:44.969
Renée, that's enough.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.972
-[Prof Hemmings chokes]
-[thuds]

05:49.557 --> 05:50.475
What do you want?

05:52.977 --> 05:54.103
Oh, sweetness.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.272
Don't ask me what I want.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.900
Ask what I'm prepared to give.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.740
[Jack] Lilith, you killed that girl!

06:05.823 --> 06:08.284
Girl? She was barely human.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.496
-Oh, look, they're fighting.
-Guys.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.373
No. Stop.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.917
There are ways to do this
without killing everyone.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.752
What part of "werewolf"
don't you understand?

06:17.877 --> 06:22.215
Honestly? I don't know why we spell it
like "were," but pronounce it like "wear."

06:22.298 --> 06:24.634
What if that girl was possessed?
Maybe she was like Clarke.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.885
Maybe we could have saved her.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.261
Look, fine.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.015
Sometimes we can wear out a spell
and not kill anyone and that's great.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.768
But if it comes down to me
or some monster bitch

06:33.851 --> 06:35.603
who ate a guy's face off,
I'm getting mine.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.731
And how many innocent people have died
so you can get your rocks off?

06:38.856 --> 06:41.567
-You're not in charge here.
-No, I am.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.694
You, stop trying to call the shots.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.239
You, stop trying to kill everybody.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.533
[door bangs]

06:58.793 --> 07:00.169
I'm dying, Eddie.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.679
Are you sure?

07:10.221 --> 07:11.514
Oh, it's cancer.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.142
Doctor certified.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.271
You know, it turns out
death is a lot less fun

07:18.354 --> 07:19.897
if I'm not the one causing it.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.862
Well, you of all people know
the future isn't written in stone.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.865
Yeah, well, it depends
on whose future you're looking at.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.658
Then why are you here?

07:32.368 --> 07:34.537
'Cause you're gonna save my life,
dumb-dumb.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.707
I'm a little busy, Renée.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.750
Ah, yes.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.587
Hunting The Vade Maecum Infernal.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.841
And you have two pieces left.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.471
But the only ones who know where they are
have been dead for a long...

07:52.221 --> 07:53.306
long time.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.935
What if you could talk to the dead?

07:59.687 --> 08:01.355
What if you could simply...

08:01.981 --> 08:05.318
ask where it all was...

08:06.611 --> 08:08.613
and they had to tell you the truth?

08:10.406 --> 08:12.408
We both know that's not possible.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.287
Not unless you have...

08:17.580 --> 08:18.498
the Necrophone.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.003
It's practically a legend.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.256
So am I.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.180
I cure your cancer,
you give me the device.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.349
You've always been a clever boy.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.435
It's dangerous magic.

08:40.436 --> 08:41.604
Unpredictable.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.234
I already know you're going to say yes.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.654
That's why I came.

08:52.406 --> 08:53.824
Don't waste too much time.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.916
You should go home to your cats, Vera.
They're missing you.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.421
-I don't have cats.
-Oh, you will.

09:11.759 --> 09:15.346
You're not really thinking
of helping her,<i> </i>are you?

09:16.764 --> 09:20.017
We do an Elemental Transference,
like we did with Keith Richards.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.771
It's high risk, but saving her life
puts us years ahead of schedule.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.731
You'd be better off letting her die.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.527
Since when do I take orders
from a Temple Magus?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.030
We will do everything in our power
to save her.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.034
-And if she dies, it's no great loss.
-[Vera] Mm.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.371
Try telling that to the blood-soaked
hellion she calls her sister.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.211
You fail this spell

09:47.962 --> 09:50.339
and that's exactly what you'll be doing.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.558
[Jack] Alyssa! Alyssa!

10:02.435 --> 10:03.978
Hey. Oh!

10:04.061 --> 10:04.895
[Alyssa] Hey.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.941
-So, listen.
-You get a new tutor?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.402
What? Oh, yeah, Selena.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.237
She's not as good as you.

10:14.739 --> 10:18.284
She is if she can stop you
from performing unsanctioned magic.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.411
Look, last week

10:20.745 --> 10:23.414
we talked and then we kissed.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.292
Mm-hm. I know. I was there.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.461
-What's your point?
-It was great.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.379
-Fun and--
-[Alyssa] Fun?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.590
-That's what you're gonna go with?
-No!

10:33.257 --> 10:37.345
Look, my first crush was on the girl robot
in Wall-E, so when I met you...

10:37.637 --> 10:39.764
Oh, my God, Jack. Stop.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.937
I almost died.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.690
-Because the kiss was so good?
-No. Forget the kiss.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.150
I'd rather not.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.487
Remember how the Grand Magus recruited me
or that project?

10:55.613 --> 10:59.867
Well, I helped him do this insane spell

10:59.950 --> 11:02.578
and things got way out of hand.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.539
-And he almost killed you?
-No. Edward saved my life.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.582
Edward?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.584
What does he have to do with us?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.419
Jack...

11:12.088 --> 11:13.798
he made me realize what I want.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.717
And that's what?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.345
-To be the Grand Magus.
-Alyssa, hey.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.765
I'm glad I caught you. Morton,
you might as well hear this, too.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.934
There's gonna be an incantation
this Friday,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.103
and I happen to know
it's going to be huge.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.897
It's not another destabilize
the Argentinian economy thing, is it?

11:29.980 --> 11:30.981
No, no.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.776
It's way bigger than that.
Like, life and death type shit.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.278
I'd never even heard of it before.
It's called...

11:36.570 --> 11:38.698
-an elemental something...
-An Elemental Transference?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.282
Yeah. That's it. That's it.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.493
What the hell
is an Elemental Transference?

11:42.576 --> 11:45.246
[Jack] That's what I asked.
It's not in any of the basic spell books.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.456
Alyssa said it's super-rare.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.084
But trust me, if Coventry ordered it,
it can't be good.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.920
I've done it twice already. Go to the bar.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.381
I don't want to go. It's too crowded.
Come on.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.175
I want to go on record
that I am completely opposed to this.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.719
[Hamish] You want to go to the bar?

12:00.761 --> 12:02.263
Yeah, no.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.764
Come on.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.349
Come on.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.939
<i>Anaplerosi.</i>

12:14.692 --> 12:16.777
[awed sigh]

12:16.986 --> 12:19.989
-[R] Wait, why is there no ringing?
-[H] Maybe because he's a Knight.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.032
-[Randall] So cool.
-[Lilith] So not cool.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.577
Look, we have to figure out
what this  Elemental Transference is

12:24.660 --> 12:25.995
and why they want it.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.247
No. We need to stop them.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.875
You can't just storm the temple
on this one.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.252
The place is defended
with a fuck-ton of magic spells.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.921
That's ten shit-tons. Impressive.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.759
-I suppose you have a better idea?
-I'm behind enemy lines.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.303
Okay, I can sabotage the spell
from the inside,

12:42.386 --> 12:44.889
and stall for time while you guys
research what it does.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.141
-Sounds good.
-Sounds stupid.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.184
Guys.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.603
We're supposed to be
the Knights of Saint Christopher,

12:50.686 --> 12:52.563
not the Nerds of Saint Christopher.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.441
-[R] And what if he gets caught?
-They'll probably just kill him.

12:55.524 --> 12:56.400
Wait, what?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.527
Hey, this is your idea.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.447
When he screws up and dies,
we go with my plan.

13:01.697 --> 13:02.531
Deal.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.366
[chink of glasses]

13:04.450 --> 13:09.455
[faint crackle of flame]

13:16.253 --> 13:18.005
[man's voice] Hey, watch the lines, bro.

13:18.088 --> 13:23.928
[crackle of flame]

13:27.389 --> 13:28.224
[Alyssa] Jack.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.975
Kyle, watch this.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.728
If that's mineral salt,
it goes to the reliquary for now.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.065
All this for one incantation?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.318
It's not for an incantation.
It's for the benefit of the entire Order.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.237
You mean for Coventry.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.864
-Reliquary. Go.
-Yes, Medicum.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.368
[smacking sound]

13:47.910 --> 13:49.703
Watch where you're going, Morton.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.580
Be careful.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.708
We spill any of this Quicksilver,
we're gonna be in deep shit.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.380
Now.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.090
[rising sounds]

14:01.173 --> 14:06.762
[low bubbling]

14:06.846 --> 14:08.597
-[Kyle] Oh.
-[squeak of metal]

14:08.681 --> 14:09.932
Holy shit.

14:13.102 --> 14:13.936
Okay.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.232
[faint click]

14:18.858 --> 14:19.984
<i>Anaplerosi.</i>

14:21.443 --> 14:24.363
-[bubbling sound]
-[woman's voice] Oh, no!

14:24.446 --> 14:26.740
[Vera] Two days of preparation ruined.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.159
And I'd like to know who's responsible.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.497
Hm?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.754
[Alyssa] It was me.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.759
The transference chains
were my responsibility.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.763
I asked Kyle to take over while...

14:51.682 --> 14:53.309
I checked on something else.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.894
Ms. Drake.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.439
This kind of failure is unacceptable.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.819
You're banned from temple
until we've completed the transference.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.659
Yes, Magus.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.975
How's it going?

15:36.769 --> 15:37.603
Slow.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.608
Hey.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.526
Accidents happen.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.655
I don't need a pep talk.
It was my responsibility

15:47.738 --> 15:49.573
and I screwed up.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.492
I let them down.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.495
I let <i>him</i> down.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.830
Edward?

15:58.415 --> 16:01.126
This spell is so important to him.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.675
So, that's all?

16:09.885 --> 16:12.513
I don't see how
that's any of your business.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.640
Then... go talk to him.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.226
-Explain the situation.
-No. This is my problem.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.853
The Order helps those
who help themselves.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.105
Is that what they do?

16:21.981 --> 16:25.567
From where I'm sitting,
it sounds more like a pyramid scheme.

16:25.901 --> 16:26.860
We do all the work,

16:26.944 --> 16:30.072
and maybe someday we'll get someone else
to do all the work for us.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.742
Oh, is that what you think?
After all your years of experience?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.040
[Alyssa sighs]

16:41.250 --> 16:42.292
I'm not hungry.

16:43.127 --> 16:43.961
Here.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.508
Alyssa?

16:58.684 --> 16:59.601
Look,

17:00.269 --> 17:01.895
I really am sorry.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.732
Why? It's not your fault.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.526
Even if it was,
there's nothing you can do.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.381
[faint sound of dogs barking]

17:34.636 --> 17:35.846
[crash]

17:38.724 --> 17:40.309
[child's voice] Can I help you?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.731
-Are you all right?
-What?

17:46.231 --> 17:47.232
Oh, yeah.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.235
I'm looking for Edward Coventry?
Is this his house?

17:51.862 --> 17:54.406
I hope so. Otherwise, I'm trespassing.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.533
[Edward] Maddox, let's go, buddy!

17:57.701 --> 17:59.703
[Edward panting]

18:00.913 --> 18:01.914
I know you.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.750
I'm Jack Morton from Belgrave University.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.168
Met you at the...

18:07.086 --> 18:09.129
the thing with the, the stuff?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.673
-You killed the golem?
-[Edward] Maddox, shh.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.633
[Edward laughs]

18:12.716 --> 18:14.134
-Sick.
-[Edward] All right.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.345
Why don't you get inside?
I'll kick your ass later.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.347
-No, you won't. Nice meeting you, Jack!
-Go on.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.142
Well, this is highly unusual,
you being here.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.062
It's about Alyssa Drake.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.527
[cell phone beeps]

18:31.610 --> 18:32.820
[gates click open]

18:35.656 --> 18:36.740
Mr. Morton.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.744
You know, don't take this the wrong way,
but what are you doing at my house?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.081
Look, the whole mess at the temple,

18:44.581 --> 18:45.958
it wasn't Alyssa's fault.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.377
I ruined your spell.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.548
I mean, I didn't do it on purpose.
It was an accident.

18:56.093 --> 18:56.927
Jack,

18:57.469 --> 18:58.512
relax.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.514
Nothing's ruined.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.141
We're right on schedule.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.102
The way Chancellor Stone reacted...

19:05.185 --> 19:07.521
The Magus runs the temple
the way she likes.

19:08.188 --> 19:11.358
As for the spell, look, it has to succeed.
It's important to me.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.486
Then why kick Alyssa off the team?

19:15.028 --> 19:18.073
She is the best you've got.
And she deserves to be there.

19:18.157 --> 19:18.991
Jack.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.368
Do you understand what we do?

19:21.660 --> 19:24.121
We create order...

19:24.872 --> 19:25.914
from chaos.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.585
We have the power to change the world.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.130
And yeah, we demand a lot of you.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.090
And it's not always fair.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.801
But The Order's not about fairness.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.220
The Order...

19:40.304 --> 19:43.932
[faint ringing starts]

19:44.016 --> 19:47.352
-it's about...
-[splashing and crackling]

19:47.811 --> 19:49.771
It's about rising to your potential.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.898
Great advice.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.482
[rising sound]

19:52.566 --> 19:54.568
-[slashing sound]
-[Edward yells]

19:54.651 --> 19:56.904
[Edward groans]

19:56.987 --> 19:59.656
[roaring]

19:59.823 --> 20:01.825
[sound of blood squelching]

20:02.534 --> 20:04.661
[roaring fades]

20:04.745 --> 20:06.955
The Order is about rising
to your potential.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.626
[Jack panting faintly]

20:13.503 --> 20:15.380
I see a lot of myself in you, Jack.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.014
We both grew up poor,
we both rose from nothing.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.976
And best of all,
we are both honest men.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.272
It takes balls to do what you did.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.359
But most importantly,
you did it for The Order.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.783
I have an assignment for you,
if you're up to it.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.285
Of course, whatever you need.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.079
And Alyssa?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.705
Don't worry, son.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.916
I'll take care of Alyssa.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.167
[gates click open]

21:12.312 --> 21:14.356
[Hamish]
Rub all you want, it won't come out.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.485
If I was trying to rub one out,
you'd know.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.196
[Hamish] What are you doing?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.574
Waiting for Morton to fuck up.

21:25.075 --> 21:25.909
You?

21:27.035 --> 21:28.078
Extra credit.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.093
Anything interesting in this one?

21:44.720 --> 21:47.389
-Depends. Can you read Sumerian?
-No.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.268
Yes.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.692
How do I know Sumerian?

21:58.775 --> 22:00.360
Because Timber knows it.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.489
Jack's right. There's a lot we don't know
about our powers.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.743
You should read this.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.996
It's the diary of a Knight from the 1800s.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.708
She talks about the hides, their powers.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.169
You might learn something.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.634
I know everything I need.

22:36.938 --> 22:39.941
I remember the night you said the oath.
After Cassie, after sh--

22:41.985 --> 22:42.903
[sighs]

22:45.989 --> 22:48.075
You, me, and Randall got drunk.

22:50.077 --> 22:54.247
We crashed out and you spent all night
down here carving your name on that trunk.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.709
I was so mad at you for defacing it.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.631
But then I figured, Cassie's dead.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.966
It's hers now.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.345
Let her do what she wants.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.182
That's what everyone does anyway.

23:12.265 --> 23:14.142
I'm saying not all change is bad.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.817
[Lilith]
We never should have taken Jack in.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.236
He doesn't need this.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.238
Not like we do.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.659
No one needs this, Lil.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.454
I need this!

23:35.705 --> 23:37.999
I don't even know who I was before this.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.628
I gave my life to the cause.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.841
And what the fuck am I supposed to do
if the cause won't take it?

23:47.008 --> 23:47.968
Keep living.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.726
-Where are you going?
-Out.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.318
[sound of traffic nearby]

24:06.403 --> 24:08.113
[faint squeak of brakes]

24:08.196 --> 24:09.364
[engine stops]

24:09.448 --> 24:10.699
[horn blares]

24:11.074 --> 24:12.284
[Kyle] Get in, townie.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.711
[door slams]

24:22.794 --> 24:24.546
[engine starts]

24:49.196 --> 24:50.572
[faint squeak of brakes]

24:50.655 --> 24:51.948
[keys rattle]

24:52.032 --> 24:53.366
[female voice] Subjects are ready.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.494
What are you waiting for?
Open the back, load them up.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.412
-Go!
-[male voice] At once.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.876
[female voice]
Let's go. Let's go, come on!

25:03.460 --> 25:05.962
-[female] Let's go, let's go.
-[male] Bags on your head. Let's go.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.048
Come on, bags on your head. Move!

25:09.549 --> 25:10.467
[female] Hurry up.

25:11.259 --> 25:12.177
Get in there.

25:13.970 --> 25:14.971
[Jack] What is this?

25:15.514 --> 25:18.183
I don't recall giving you permission
to ask questions.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.062
[male voice] It's okay, kid.
Don't sweat it. I'm an element.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.688
An element?

25:24.439 --> 25:25.273
What does that even mean?

25:25.357 --> 25:28.360
It means everybody needs to get in
the van! Like now! Hurry up!

25:29.152 --> 25:30.695
[male voice] You heard him. Let's go!

25:30.779 --> 25:33.198
-Are we kidnapping these people?
-What does it look like?

25:33.281 --> 25:36.785
-It looks like we're kidnapping these pe--
-They're volunteers! Okay?

25:36.868 --> 25:38.245
So, just relax.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.665
The transference only works
with willing participants anyways.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.877
[male in van] Yeah, it's fine.
You're paying my family a hundred grand.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.047
Plus you're giving my granddaughter
a full scholarship.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.466
-See?
-What are they volunteering for?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.802
And why are we paying their families
and not them?

25:53.927 --> 25:57.097
[male in van, laughing]
Because we're all gonna die, stupid.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.390
[doors slam]

25:58.473 --> 25:59.933
[female] All right. Let's go.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.562
Congratulations, Morton. You're about
to pop your sacrifice cherry.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.814
[chuckles]

26:05.981 --> 26:07.357
Ah.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.275
[loud bang]

26:08.358 --> 26:09.859
[sound of metal creaking]

26:09.943 --> 26:11.486
[engine revs]

26:11.570 --> 26:13.613
[wheels spinning]

26:14.364 --> 26:17.701
-[male] Try putting it in gear?
-Try shutting up, bag of bones.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.828
[male chuckles]

26:20.620 --> 26:22.747
-Right, whatever you're doing, cut it out.
-It's not me.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.874
[wheels scream, spinning]

26:24.958 --> 26:28.920
[engine revving]

26:29.588 --> 26:30.422
[snarls]

26:30.505 --> 26:32.215
Oh, shit. Kyle, cut the engine.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.758
Kyle! Cut the fucking engine!

26:33.842 --> 26:36.720
[wheels screaming]

26:36.803 --> 26:38.471
-[engine roars]
-[crash]

26:38.555 --> 26:39.931
[sound of glass smashing]

26:44.811 --> 26:45.729
[Jack gasps]

26:48.607 --> 26:50.692
You want to explain yourself, asshole?

26:52.152 --> 26:54.237
-This isn't what it looks like.
-Really?

26:54.321 --> 26:57.240
'Cause it looks like you're driving
five people to their slaughter.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.409
-I didn't know that!
-[Lilith] Now, you do.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.119
-And we're gonna stop it.
-No.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.039
The Grand Magus is after something.
I need to know what.

27:04.998 --> 27:05.957
You can't stop it.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.667
I won't let you.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.962
You think I can't take you?

27:11.588 --> 27:13.298
You think you can take Silverback?

27:23.975 --> 27:24.851
Wake up!

27:25.226 --> 27:27.437
[Kyle grunts]

27:28.813 --> 27:30.315
Hang on, old man.

27:30.398 --> 27:31.941
[male] Gad, go fuck yourself!

27:36.404 --> 27:38.114
[Lilith] You fucking hypocrite!

27:38.198 --> 27:40.283
Okay, let's take a breath.

27:40.367 --> 27:44.037
You have the nerve to give me shit
about eating some monster's heart,

27:44.120 --> 27:46.790
but you turn around and drive a van
full of people to their death!

27:46.873 --> 27:49.250
-You what?
-It's the Elemental Transference.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.711
The spell needs willing sacrifices.
Five of them.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.713
You're supposed to be sabotaging it.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.924
-Not helping.
-I did sabotage it!

27:56.007 --> 27:58.259
Okay? And we were up and running again
in twelve hours.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.512
[Randall] Dude... we're your "we."

28:01.513 --> 28:02.472
[Lilith] So you failed.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.807
-You admit it.
-No.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.559
Look, I talked to Coventry.
I saw it in his eyes.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.396
He’s so desperate for this spell,
he'll do anything.

28:09.562 --> 28:12.065
He'll risk the entire Order,
and we need to know why.

28:12.148 --> 28:12.982
We know why.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.946
This spell cures sickness
by passing it on to other people.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.865
And they don't just die.
The disease has to kill them,

28:20.949 --> 28:24.160
or else the whole thing reverses.
It's torture, Jack.

28:24.994 --> 28:26.287
When did I learn Latin?

28:26.705 --> 28:29.207
Look, no! If he's doing this spell,
he's doing it for a reason.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.959
There'll be something big
at the end of it.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.963
If we play it smart, I can figure out
what Coventry's after, what his plan is,

28:35.046 --> 28:37.590
-and then at the right moment--
-The moment is now!

28:38.133 --> 28:41.344
-This is the reason we became Knights!
-What if we make it worse?

28:41.678 --> 28:44.639
What if we save these five people,
and then he kills a thousand?

28:44.723 --> 28:47.225
-I won't let that happen.
-[Jack] He lit his hand on fire

28:47.308 --> 28:51.062
as a parlor trick. You go at him,
he's gonna put you down.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.814
And then none of this is gonna matter.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.900
-It's gonna matter to those five people.
-Oh, whatever, "Kill-ith."

28:57.068 --> 29:01.156
Okay, I love that nickname,
but this is still wrong.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.287
Randall, you wanted an inside man.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.165
Let me do my job as a Knight.

29:12.584 --> 29:17.088
Hamish, no one can save those people,
but we can stop Edward Coventry for good.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.549
You see a chance to stop this spell,
you take it.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.926
-I promise I will.
-Then go.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.603
[sound of church bells]

29:36.816 --> 29:43.031
[silently mouthing words]

29:46.117 --> 29:49.996
Oh, for God's sake,
I can smell your lust.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.956
Get out of my sight, you dripping sheep.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.208
[door rattles]

29:54.042 --> 29:55.043
Go.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.548
[door closes]

30:02.550 --> 30:03.384
[Edward sighs]

30:03.468 --> 30:06.596
-This is your last chance to back out.
-Now why would I ever do that?

30:06.679 --> 30:08.431
Because if the spell
doesn't go as planned...

30:08.515 --> 30:11.935
Oh, Eddie Munster, you really do care
about me, don't you?

30:15.104 --> 30:16.314
I care about the deal.

30:17.106 --> 30:17.982
Fuck the deal.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.194
You know, you'd be a lot happier
without it.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.655
This is my life's work.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.075
Do you know why The Order
kicked me out, Eddie?

30:27.784 --> 30:30.829
Because you and your sister
almost killed half the coven.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.706
They kicked me out

30:34.457 --> 30:36.167
because I saw the future.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.546
I saw what The Order becomes.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.464
I saw what you become.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.843
And it scared the shit out of them.

30:45.635 --> 30:48.471
Your ambition, it comes with a price.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.765
And you know that.

30:52.475 --> 30:55.311
Or do you really think your wife's death
was an accident?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.399
Leave Sophie out of this.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.776
I'm not blaming you, Eddie.

31:02.318 --> 31:04.654
Just merely reminding you

31:05.280 --> 31:07.031
that fate...

31:08.199 --> 31:09.409
like everything else...

31:11.578 --> 31:12.745
is negotiable.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.346
Maybe you should think about quitting.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.313
You first.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.868
[door bangs shut]

31:55.413 --> 31:57.498
-[bang]
-I've read your stupid book.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.876
This Knight? She wore your hide.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.210
She was a leader.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.631
She listened to people,
she trusted their instincts.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.258
-She believed in the cause.
-So do I.

32:07.675 --> 32:08.843
We can't just sit here.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.889
-I have to stop that spell.
-We can't fight The Order head on.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.391
I get it, Hamish.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.019
-You're old, and you want to live.
-I'm not old.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.020
And duh!

32:19.103 --> 32:21.898
But the price those people are paying
is on us.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.191
Jack won't save them.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.526
-He can't even save himself.
-Jack's one of us.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.819
He'll do the right thing.

32:26.903 --> 32:30.073
[ringing starts]

32:30.156 --> 32:33.743
-[ringing]
-[Lilith sighs]

32:33.826 --> 32:35.328
This is it, Hamish.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.413
It's happening.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.792
So, you need to decide.
What kind of leader are you?

32:44.003 --> 32:46.005
The kind that knows what he's doing.

32:46.506 --> 32:47.924
Now, stand down.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.513
[Lilith stamping]

32:55.139 --> 32:56.349
[door slams]

32:56.432 --> 33:01.854
[chanting in Latin]

33:01.938 --> 33:08.736
[Latin chant continues]

33:18.329 --> 33:19.414
Hm.

33:19.497 --> 33:26.254
[Latin chant continues]

33:34.929 --> 33:38.850
[Latin chant continues]

33:38.933 --> 33:42.270

[ringing sound]

34:04.834 --> 34:06.836
[Latin chant continues]

34:14.427 --> 34:15.636
[Latin chant finishes]

[sounds fade]

35:16.280 --> 35:17.532

35:25.123 --> 35:26.082
[sighs]

35:27.917 --> 35:30.169
[faint groaning]

35:30.253 --> 35:36.551
[laughs]

35:39.679 --> 35:40.680
[sighs]

35:49.564 --> 35:50.481
Eddie...

35:51.440 --> 35:53.901
that was a miracle.

35:55.778 --> 35:56.779
You look good.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.782
I look amazing and you know it.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.204
I have some people ready to take you home.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.623
When you're ready.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.043
I was hoping you might tuck me in.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.588
Now, you know that's not going to happen.

36:14.046 --> 36:17.967
You said it yourself, Eddie,
the future's not set in stone.

36:20.386 --> 36:23.014
It's all twisty and turny...

36:24.307 --> 36:26.309
like your intestinal organs.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.064
Once you're home,
give my people the device.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.319
After all we've been through
and you still don't trust me?

36:43.576 --> 36:44.410
[kissing]

36:47.163 --> 36:48.539
Not on your life.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.428
[exhales]

37:06.641 --> 37:08.559
[Lilith] Jack said he would come back.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.686
He fucked us. It's over.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.231
No. We can still stop it.

37:13.606 --> 37:14.440
How?

37:14.523 --> 37:17.526
The book said the sacrifices have to die
from the disease.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.445
And what happens if they don't?

37:19.695 --> 37:20.571
We win.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.323
Follow my lead.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.076
About fucking time.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.287
[Renée] Would you kids like a drink?

37:28.371 --> 37:31.499
Some hard drugs?<i> </i>An orgy?

37:32.541 --> 37:33.376
Er...

37:34.293 --> 37:36.003
We should probably get going.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.839
How disappointing. The case...

37:40.216 --> 37:43.135
for Edward, with my compliments.

37:43.219 --> 37:46.055
-Is there anything we need to tell him?
-Oh, is there ever?

37:51.060 --> 37:52.144
Okay, so...

37:53.813 --> 37:57.316
I guess... Is that it? We just leave?

37:58.067 --> 38:00.319
How are we supposed to get home?
She has the car.

38:02.029 --> 38:05.783
-Let's worry about that in the morning.
-No, I don't wanna stay here.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.868
No, we'll get a hotel room. My treat.

38:08.786 --> 38:09.662
Together?

38:11.414 --> 38:13.958
Relax. You can sleep on the couch.

38:18.963 --> 38:23.509
[muted sound of voices and beeping
in background]

38:23.592 --> 38:25.845
[message alert swoosh]

38:27.805 --> 38:28.723

38:55.333 --> 38:57.335
[sound of a bell]

38:57.418 --> 38:58.377
Who's there?

39:00.129 --> 39:06.886
[beeping continues]

39:09.930 --> 39:16.187
-[beeping]
-[creaking of floorboards]

39:16.270 --> 39:17.146
[door creaks]

39:18.522 --> 39:19.357
Hey. What's up?

39:20.316 --> 39:22.693
-Who are you? What are you doing here?
-Where are my friends?

39:22.777 --> 39:23.986
Yeah, where are your--

39:24.070 --> 39:27.698
-[screaming]
-[snarling]

39:27.782 --> 39:31.077
[snarling]

39:33.829 --> 39:38.125
-[beeping sounds]
-[man sighing]

39:38.209 --> 39:40.961
-[man groans]
-[Lilith] Why would anyone agree to this?

39:42.546 --> 39:44.382
Because they were already dying.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.304
Weren't you, old man?

39:53.766 --> 39:55.059
Fucking cirrhosis.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.105
[Hamish]
The spell said "willing sacrifices."

40:00.564 --> 40:02.108
Who else would be willing to die?

40:02.566 --> 40:03.484
[man] Please.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.069
It hurts.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.655
Just kill me.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.156
Just kill me.

40:09.615 --> 40:10.991
That's why you sided with Jack.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.661
Are you ready?

40:15.538 --> 40:16.997
I'm not sure I can do this.

40:17.915 --> 40:18.791
Call it mercy.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.720
-[bang]
-[snarling]

40:31.804 --> 40:35.182
-[snarling]

[bell rings]

40:41.939 --> 40:44.567
[sound of traffic outside]

40:53.951 --> 40:57.329
See? There's your couch,
and there's my bed.

40:57.496 --> 40:58.789
[Jack] Hm.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.707
[laughs]

41:06.797 --> 41:07.923
Those people...

41:09.258 --> 41:10.134
that spell...

41:11.552 --> 41:14.472
I just hope whatever is in that case
is worth all that suffering.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.227
They were dying
before we ever touched them.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.606
At least this way, their families
are taken care of and...

41:24.023 --> 41:26.233
This case, Edward's plan,

41:26.442 --> 41:28.402
we're going to help so many people.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.113
We're going to change the world.

41:32.907 --> 41:33.741
[sighs]

41:37.453 --> 41:39.079
He told me what you did.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.290
That you went to see him.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.544
He said that you were chivalrous.

41:51.008 --> 41:51.884
My knight.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.691
[Alyssa] I... I guess I'll...

42:09.068 --> 42:10.444
see you in the morning.

42:12.404 --> 42:13.239
Yeah.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.372
[door clicks]

42:22.206 --> 42:23.040
[sighs]

43:12.881 --> 43:13.799
[door clicks]

43:17.886 --> 43:18.721
Er...

43:21.015 --> 43:21.932
I couldn't sleep.

43:22.808 --> 43:23.684
[laughs]

43:24.560 --> 43:25.519
Me neither.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.482
Do you want to not sleep together?

43:35.321 --> 43:36.363
Absolutely.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.100
[exhales slowly]

44:56.819 --> 44:57.986
[sound of a drip]

45:10.541 --> 45:13.669
[sound of water]

45:13.752 --> 45:17.089
[bubbling sound]

45:17.172 --> 45:18.340
Oh, fuck!

45:18.757 --> 45:20.467
[bubbling and hissing]

45:20.551 --> 45:22.928
[screams]
