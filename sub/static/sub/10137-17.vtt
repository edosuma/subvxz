In Greece, someone

04:28.060 --> 04:29.770
Kimmy is the most

irritating person

04:29.811 --> 04:31.271
in the entire world.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.607
Welcome to our side.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.443
You know, she wore those

04:33.648 --> 04:36.443
sunglasses all day in school

04:36.484 --> 04:37.861
even in gym.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.320
What's wrong with that?

04:39.362 --> 04:40.655
We were swimming.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.452
I mean, she knew

04:43.117 --> 04:45.452
I wanted those glasses.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.079
And she knew I wouldn't wear

04:45.493 --> 04:47.079
'em if she had 'em

04:47.121 --> 04:48.580
but she bought 'em anyway.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.041
You know, this sounds

04:48.622 --> 04:51.041
like a fight

04:51.083 --> 04:54.128
that two men

04:51.083 --> 04:54.128
in my village had.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.379
Nikos bought his wife

04:56.421 --> 04:59.967
a beautiful pair

04:56.421 --> 04:59.967
of pink ox-hair slippers.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.010
Andreas found out about it

05:02.052 --> 05:04.429
and then he bought

05:02.052 --> 05:04.429
the very same slippers.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.515
Well, maybe his wife

05:04.471 --> 05:07.515
had cold feet.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.392
Deej, Deej,

05:07.557 --> 05:09.392
you're missing the point.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.728
have a lesson, okay?

05:11.770 --> 05:14.148
And he's passing down the wisdom

05:11.770 --> 05:14.148
of our Greek ancestors.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.315
So you gotta listen okay?

05:15.356 --> 05:16.608
This story is not just

05:16.650 --> 05:18.026
about ox-hair slippers.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.987
It's about..

...uh, well,

05:20.028 --> 05:21.529
this, this particular story..

05:21.571 --> 05:23.323
What's the story

05:21.571 --> 05:23.323
about,<i> Papouli?</i>

It's about time

you shut up

05:24.658 --> 05:25.909
and let me

05:24.658 --> 05:25.909
finish the story.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.077
Right.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.830
The point is

05:29.871 --> 05:32.833
that Andreas

05:29.871 --> 05:32.833
wasn't even married.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.084
He bought the slippers

05:34.126 --> 05:36.377
because Nikos

05:34.126 --> 05:36.377
had the slippers.

05:36.419 --> 05:40.841
Well, he walked all around town

05:36.419 --> 05:40.841
in those slippers.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.676
'Course, he had

05:40.882 --> 05:42.676
the legs to carry it off.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.224
- Anyway.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.768
Uh, Nikos was

05:49.266 --> 05:51.768
so mad at Andreas

05:51.810 --> 05:53.603
he never spoke

05:51.810 --> 05:53.603
to him again.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.063
See. See, Deej?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.398
Words to live by

05:55.105 --> 05:57.398

05:57.440 --> 05:58.900
Now you know

05:57.440 --> 05:58.900
what he's talking about?

05:58.942 --> 06:02.321
Mm-hmm. Andreas was a jerk

05:58.942 --> 06:02.321
just like Kimmy.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.823
Well, yes.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.823
Yes, that's right.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.365
Is that,

06:04.865 --> 06:06.365
is that right,<i> Papoul?</i>

06:06.407 --> 06:07.951
- Not right.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.951
- That's not right, Deej.

06:09.368 --> 06:12.747
Wow.

06:09.368 --> 06:12.747
We got flour everywhere.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.249
Don't worry.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.043
When we got flour

06:14.291 --> 06:16.043
on our hands

06:16.084 --> 06:17.418
where do we wipe them off?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.630
- On a towel?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.630
- No, my little Michelle.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.757
On our nose.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.924
Happy new year.

[Greek music]

07:25.486 --> 07:27.406
Alright.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.368
Uncle Jesse,<i> Papoulis'</i> teaching

07:27.447 --> 07:31.368
me how to do a Greek dance.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.995
Come on, Jesse.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.995
We show her a couple steps, huh?

07:34.037 --> 07:36.290
No, no, thanks,<i> paupoli.</i>

07:34.037 --> 07:36.290
I really don't dance.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.127
You're Greek.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.127
You dance.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.004
<i>Papouli,</i> am I Greek?

07:43.046 --> 07:45.840
Of course, you are,

07:43.046 --> 07:45.840
my little Michelle.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.467
I don't feel Greek.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.845
Well, to feel Greek

07:50.887 --> 07:52.306
you must be proud.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.974
Proud of your ancestors

07:54.015 --> 07:57.311
the great authors

07:54.015 --> 07:57.311
and thinkers.

07:57.352 --> 08:01.022
Of course, you should enjoy

07:57.352 --> 08:01.022
life a little bit, too.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.316
That's why we dance

08:02.357 --> 08:05.068
because we cannot

08:02.357 --> 08:05.068
contain our happiness.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.903
Right, Jesse?

08:06.945 --> 08:07.904
Listen, my heart is Greek.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.115
It just my feet

08:07.946 --> 08:10.115
don't know it.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.866
Listen, you guys have fun.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.866
Dance.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.535
I'm gonna go clean up the little

08:11.908 --> 08:14.535
celebration in the kitchen.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.956
- You're doing great, Michelle.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.956
- Thank you.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.709
<i>Papouli,</i> it's share time

08:17.998 --> 08:21.709
at school next Monday.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.171
Could you come and teach

08:21.751 --> 08:24.171
my class a Greek dance?

08:24.212 --> 08:27.466
Of course, I can,

08:24.212 --> 08:27.466
my sweet little Michelle.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.009
I love you,<i> Papouli.</i>

08:29.050 --> 08:30.510
And I love you, too.

[instrumental music]

08:41.229 --> 08:44.191
[slow instrumental music]

08:48.736 --> 08:51.198
It's like a..

08:51.239 --> 08:52.532
...a bad dream or something.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.245
I know.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.080

But you know

09:02.083 --> 09:04.752
at least<i> Papouli</i> died

09:02.083 --> 09:04.752
peacefully in his sleep

09:04.794 --> 09:06.380
you know?

09:08.798 --> 09:12.427
We know how much he

09:08.798 --> 09:12.427
meant to you, Jess.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.761
He meant a lot to us, too.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.893
We're all gonna miss him.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.565
It's just..

09:25.606 --> 09:28.235
So helpless, it's like,

09:25.606 --> 09:28.235
if I could have been there

09:28.276 --> 09:29.444
I could have done something.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.987
You know,

09:29.486 --> 09:30.987
I could've helped him. I--

09:31.029 --> 09:34.157
Jesse, honey.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.157
Honey, honey.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.576
There was nothing

09:34.199 --> 09:36.576
that you could do.

09:38.786 --> 09:42.040
There was nothing

09:38.786 --> 09:42.040
that any of us could do.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.375
You know.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.960
You're right.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.430
It's just that he was

09:52.759 --> 09:56.430
such a beautiful man.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.224
Just so full of

09:56.471 --> 09:59.224
love and life.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.811
Now he's gone.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.109
Uncle Jesse..

10:09.150 --> 10:10.360
...you okay?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.907
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
I'm fine. No, I-I

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
don't have time for this.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.828
I got so many things to do,

10:17.992 --> 10:20.828
make the arrangements--

10:20.870 --> 10:22.330
We want to help.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.831
Yeah, Jess, we-we can

10:22.372 --> 10:23.831
take care of all that.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.377
No. You know what,

10:23.873 --> 10:27.377
it's-it's my responsibility.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.463
I'm just..

10:29.504 --> 10:31.672
I'm sorry, guys.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.672
I'll-I'll-I'll take care of it.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.427
Why won't Uncle Jesse

10:33.633 --> 10:35.427
let us help him?

10:37.387 --> 10:39.598
Oh, honey, it's just his way

10:39.639 --> 10:41.891
of dealing with the pain,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.891
you know, by keeping busy.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.645

It was great.

Where is he?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.913

11:08.668 --> 11:09.919
It's okay.

Uh, sweetheart,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.469
this is, uh

11:17.511 --> 11:19.846
this is not easy

11:17.511 --> 11:19.846
to say to you.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.764
Uh..

11:21.806 --> 11:24.559
This morning after

11:21.806 --> 11:24.559
you went to school

11:24.601 --> 11:26.561
we went

11:24.601 --> 11:26.561
to wake up<i> Papouli.</i>

11:29.772 --> 11:31.732
Michelle, he died

11:29.772 --> 11:31.732
in his sleep last night.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.110
What?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.153
He was, he was just..

11:35.195 --> 11:36.279
He was very old

11:36.321 --> 11:38.532
and his heart gave out.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.740
No, he's not dead.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.385
- Michelle.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.385
- Why did<i> Papouli</i> have to die?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.970
It's not fair.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.263
I know.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.058
It's a part of life, sweetie.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.479
And<i> Papouli</i> led

12:06.601 --> 12:09.479
a long and full life.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.606
It makes me so mad.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.360
It's okay to feel mad.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.987
You lost somebody

12:15.402 --> 12:17.987
that you love

12:18.029 --> 12:19.573
but we're a family, right?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.948
So, we're gonna help pull

12:19.614 --> 12:20.948
each other through this.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.158
Okay?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.577
Okay.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.746
Is there anything

12:25.078 --> 12:27.746
you want to ask me?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.832
No.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.377
Okay, well, if you do

12:32.419 --> 12:34.003
I'm here for you.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.130
So if you have any questions

12:34.045 --> 12:36.130
about what you're feeling

12:36.172 --> 12:39.008
or about what happened,

12:36.172 --> 12:39.008
you just come talk to me, okay?

12:39.050 --> 12:40.343
Okay.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.136
Okay.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.431
I love you.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.205
- Hey, Michelle.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.205
- 'Hi.'

13:09.247 --> 13:12.375
- How you doin'?

13:09.247 --> 13:12.375
- I feel like crying.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.543
Me, too.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.006
But we can't do that

13:16.463 --> 13:19.006
in front of Uncle Jesse.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.925
Why not?

13:20.967 --> 13:24.095
'Cause if he saw us crying..

13:24.137 --> 13:25.764
...he might start

13:24.137 --> 13:25.764
to cry again, too.

13:25.804 --> 13:29.016
Uncle Jesse

13:25.804 --> 13:29.016
was crying?

13:29.058 --> 13:30.893
He started to.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.396
He didn't want me to see,

13:30.935 --> 13:33.396
but I did.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.234
Michelle, we gotta be

13:35.148 --> 13:38.234
brave for Uncle Jesse.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.529
And not let him know

13:38.276 --> 13:41.529
that we're sad, too.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.531
I don't know

13:41.571 --> 13:43.531
if I can do that.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.949
You have to.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.035
But how can I stop

13:44.991 --> 13:48.035
myself from crying?

13:48.077 --> 13:50.538
Just think of

13:48.077 --> 13:50.538
something funny

13:50.580 --> 13:54.833
like, uh, when Joey stuffs a

13:50.580 --> 13:54.833
whole doughnut in his mouth.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.295
Yeah, that always

13:54.875 --> 13:57.295
makes me laugh.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.716
Alright, Aunt Elaine.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.841
I'll be there in a few days.

14:08.807 --> 14:09.890
Yeah.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.519
You alright, Michelle?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.483
What are you doin'?

14:18.525 --> 14:19.693
Thinking about Joey stuffing

14:19.734 --> 14:21.486
a whole doughnut in his mouth.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.115
Oh.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.659
Alright.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.661
Now, you girls

14:27.701 --> 14:29.661
hang in there.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.287
Just talked to

14:29.703 --> 14:31.287
the relatives.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.873
Looks like I'm going back

14:31.329 --> 14:33.873

14:50.056 --> 14:52.266
Ahoy, matey.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.310
Whoa.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.603
Danny, where'd you

14:54.352 --> 14:55.603
get the boat?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.814
What boat?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.858
Oh, I, I bought it.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.694
Danny, you went and bought

14:59.899 --> 15:02.694
a boat, just like that?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.404
It took you six months

15:02.736 --> 15:04.404
to decide between

15:04.445 --> 15:06.823
liquid or powder bleach.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.825
Yeah, but, this is,

15:06.865 --> 15:08.825
this is different.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.785
This is something

15:08.867 --> 15:10.785
we always dreamed about.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.161
Isn't that right,

little buddy?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.124
Aye-aye, captain.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.627
I hear exactly

15:17.166 --> 15:19.627
what you're saying.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.295
You know, after everything

15:19.669 --> 15:21.295
that's happened this week

15:21.337 --> 15:23.882
it makes you realize

15:21.337 --> 15:23.882
that your life's really short.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.466
You should go for your dreams

15:25.508 --> 15:27.343
or you got no reason

15:25.508 --> 15:27.343
to wake up in the morning

15:27.385 --> 15:28.553
and scratch yourself.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.080
You know, I gotta..

15:56.122 --> 15:57.373
I'm gonna get back

15:56.122 --> 15:57.373
on the phones

15:57.415 --> 16:00.167
and...make a bunch of calls.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.796
You know,

16:01.461 --> 16:02.796
you need to slow down

16:02.837 --> 16:04.255

16:02.837 --> 16:04.255
for yourself.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.465
Beck, I'll be fine.

I just wanna

call the airlines

16:06.800 --> 16:07.801
and confirm that I,

I don't want

16:07.842 --> 16:09.969
to end up

16:07.842 --> 16:09.969
in Athens, Georgia.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.978
Hey, Beavis and Boat-head.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.441
Look, Joey,

16:21.898 --> 16:23.441
we caught our first fish

16:23.483 --> 16:24.734
the bigmouth Gibbler.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.988
Too bad we can't

16:27.654 --> 16:28.988
throw it back.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.785
Guys, can we

16:31.616 --> 16:33.785
have a minute?

16:33.827 --> 16:34.994
Oh, sure.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.541
Hi, Kimmy.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.710
Hey, Deej.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.879
Steve told me about

16:42.752 --> 16:44.879
your great-grandpa.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.256
I'm really sorry.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.258
Thanks.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.093
Listen, about

16:49.300 --> 16:51.093
the sunglasses--

16:51.135 --> 16:54.388
You know what,

16:51.135 --> 16:54.388
forget about the sunglasses.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.267
You know, I missed the whole

16:54.430 --> 16:58.267
point to<i> Papouli's</i> story.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.061
Yeah, Andreas was wrong,

16:58.309 --> 17:01.061
but Nikos was wrong, too.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.524
Andreas and Nikos?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.985
Have you been hanging out with

17:04.565 --> 17:06.985
those Irish exchange students?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.531
No, Kimmy.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.908
You know, we shouldn't break up

17:11.572 --> 17:13.908
a lifelong friendship

17:13.950 --> 17:16.410
over something as stupid

17:13.950 --> 17:16.410
as a pair of sunglasses.

17:18.621 --> 17:19.956
Yeah, you're right.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.208
A sweater, maybe, but..

17:24.168 --> 17:25.419
Friends again?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.462
You got it.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.014
How's Michelle?

17:33.469 --> 17:36.014
She's fine.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.641
What do you mean

17:36.055 --> 17:38.641
she's not at school?

17:38.683 --> 17:42.269
I saw her leave for school

17:38.683 --> 17:42.269
this morning.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.902
'Oh.'

17:48.943 --> 17:52.363
Boy, I sure had a big lunch

17:52.405 --> 17:55.282
but I got this one

17:52.405 --> 17:55.282
pudding cup left.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.659
What to do? What..

17:56.701 --> 17:58.786
You know, I'll just..

17:58.828 --> 18:00.955
I'll put it up here on the boat

17:58.828 --> 18:00.955
next to the other one

18:00.997 --> 18:03.374
and come back

18:00.997 --> 18:03.374
and get it later.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.292
Well, I'm off.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.255
Gotcha.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.301
That was cold.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.930
Michelle, what are you doing

18:14.343 --> 18:16.930
home from school?

18:16.971 --> 18:18.806
I..

18:18.848 --> 18:21.308
...couldn't find

18:18.848 --> 18:21.308
my backpack.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.102
What's that?

18:23.895 --> 18:25.688
Oh, it's in the boat.

18:25.730 --> 18:29.567
- It's in the boat.

18:25.730 --> 18:29.567
- The one place I didn't look.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.570
Hey, hey, shorty.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.198
Hold on a second.

18:32.612 --> 18:36.198
Come here.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.910
Come on, shorty, level with me.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.703
What's really going on?

18:40.745 --> 18:42.622
I can't tell you.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.791
You can't tell me?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.042
We tell each other

18:44.832 --> 18:46.042
everything.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.836
- Everything?

18:46.084 --> 18:48.836
- Yeah.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.129
Well..

18:51.631 --> 18:54.092
I never told you this,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.092
but, uh..

18:55.885 --> 18:59.305
I once bought

18:55.885 --> 18:59.305
a Kathie Lee Gifford CD.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.848
Oh, boy,

18:59.346 --> 19:00.848
does that feel good

19:00.890 --> 19:02.976
to get that

19:00.890 --> 19:02.976
out in the open.

19:03.017 --> 19:06.562
Alright, go ahead.

19:03.017 --> 19:06.562
It's your turn.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.565
<i>Papouli</i> was supposed to

19:06.604 --> 19:09.565
come to school today

19:09.607 --> 19:12.151
to teach my class

19:09.607 --> 19:12.151
a Greek dance.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.697
I'm sorry, kiddo.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.699
I was afraid

19:16.739 --> 19:18.699
if I went to school

19:18.741 --> 19:20.660
and<i> Papouli</i> wasn't there

19:20.701 --> 19:23.663
It felt sad.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.999
Well, Michelle,

19:23.704 --> 19:25.999
it's okay to feel sad.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.127
But if I felt sad,

19:26.040 --> 19:29.127
I might cry.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.920
Then I can't be brave..

19:30.962 --> 19:32.171
...for you.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.179
Michelle..

19:41.931 --> 19:43.057
...where'd you get the idea

19:43.099 --> 19:44.851
that you had to

19:43.099 --> 19:44.851
be brave for me?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.602
From Stephanie.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.021
She said that you were so sad

19:48.062 --> 19:49.939
we shouldn't make you worse.

19:51.649 --> 19:52.942
Oh, sweetheart..

19:53.985 --> 19:55.361
Stephanie..

19:55.402 --> 19:56.946
She probably thought

19:55.402 --> 19:56.946
she was telling you

19:56.988 --> 20:00.199
the right thing to do,

19:56.988 --> 20:00.199
but she was wrong.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.369
'I'm going to talk

20:00.240 --> 20:03.369
to her about that.'

20:03.410 --> 20:05.496
Michelle, we should..

20:05.538 --> 20:07.331
we should always share

20:05.538 --> 20:07.331
our feelings with each other.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.210
That's what makes us

20:08.958 --> 20:11.210
a family.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.508
I really loved<i> Papouli.</i>

20:17.550 --> 20:20.011
I was his little Michelle.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.224
I was his little Jesse.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.564
He used to always

20:30.188 --> 20:31.564
take care of me.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.984
Now he comes to visit me

20:35.026 --> 20:36.235
and I can't even

20:35.026 --> 20:36.235
take care of him.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.701
It's not your fault.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.037
His heart was old.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.874
I know, Michelle,

20:47.371 --> 20:49.874
but it still hurts.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.962
It's okay to be sad.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.757
I know I heard that

20:55.004 --> 20:57.757
somewhere before.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.092
Uncle Jesse?

20:59.133 --> 21:00.134
Hmm?

21:00.176 --> 21:02.595
Is it okay to cry?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.018
You bet.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.276
[crying]

21:29.080 --> 21:30.372
Thank you, Denise.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.417
That was very informative.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.170
Are you gonna be okay?

21:36.212 --> 21:37.379
Yeah.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.505
Alright.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.093
- Hi, Michelle.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.093
- Hi.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.428
Do you have something

21:42.135 --> 21:44.428
for share time today?

21:46.180 --> 21:49.475
Well...my great-grandpa<i> Papouli</i>

21:49.516 --> 21:51.852
was supposed to come

21:49.516 --> 21:51.852
to school today

to teach us

21:51.894 --> 21:54.480

21:54.521 --> 21:57.733

21:57.775 --> 22:01.737
Oh. Well, we're all

21:57.775 --> 22:01.737
very sorry, Michelle.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.030
He taught me some of it

22:03.072 --> 22:05.699
but I'm not sure

22:03.072 --> 22:05.699
if I can remember.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.078
Well, I'm sure we'd all really

22:05.741 --> 22:09.078
like it if you tried.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.538
- Yeah.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.752
Okay, I brought the tape.
