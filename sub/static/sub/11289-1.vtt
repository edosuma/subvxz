00:02.866 --> 00:05.100
I just can't believe
that Synclaire

00:05.166 --> 00:06.366
is the first one
to get married.

00:06.433 --> 00:07.966
I always thought
it would be Regine.

00:08.032 --> 00:09.166
Me too.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.300
My firm is opening up
offices in London

00:13.366 --> 00:16.033
and they have asked me
to head 'em up.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.366
Good luck on your new job.

One more time, sugar buns.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.800
[laughing]

00:42.866 --> 00:47.433
Hey, well, I, um,
suppose I could be persuaded..

00:47.500 --> 00:50.266
...if you just let me hear
those three magic words.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.433
Yeah.

00:53.733 --> 00:54.733
Again?

00:54.800 --> 00:56.266
Uh‐huh.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.633

have a heart.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.040

feel so tired?

01:06.406 --> 01:08.773
‐ Mm.

‐ Alright, shorty.

Don't keep me in suspense.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.580
Are you going
to London or what?

Oh, man, I am more confused
than ever. Come on.

Why did Max have to
utter those wicked words

02:46.346 --> 02:47.646

02:47.713 --> 02:49.380
Sometimes people
are just crazy that way.

02:49.446 --> 02:51.280
They actually say
what they feel.

02:52.713 --> 02:54.413

I got 24 hours

to make the most important
decision of my life.

02:57.146 --> 02:58.780
And either way it goes,
I wind up leaving

something I really care about,
you know?

03:00.686 --> 03:01.753
Yup, you could always take

03:01.820 --> 03:03.986
the bane of your existence
with you.

Mm, that's right.

But look here, now,
if you wanna hang with me

03:23.653 --> 03:25.086
you'd want to come back
state side

03:25.153 --> 03:27.286
'cause I pick up accents
all too easily

03:27.353 --> 03:28.586

‐ Our winged chariot awaits.
‐ Alright, here we go.

03:36.820 --> 03:38.520
‐ I got the bags here, alright.
‐ Alright, here we go. We're up.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.586
[speaking gibberish]

03:39.653 --> 03:40.886

‐ So long.
‐ Bye‐bye.

'Farewell.'

Oh man, what is happening

03:45.286 --> 03:46.553
with this world, Kyle?

03:46.620 --> 03:50.853
Synclaire is married. Max
is telling people she loves 'em.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.886
Life just doesn't
make sense anymore.

03:52.953 --> 03:55.186
Oh, boo, you still got Regine.

03:55.253 --> 03:57.186

Damn, I need a drink.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.760
Where's the lounge?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.593
I'll be right with you.
Order me a pint of beer though.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.626
‐ Room temperature.
‐ Room temp..

04:06.693 --> 04:07.893
Yeah, I'm just,
you know, practicing

04:07.960 --> 04:09.060
for my new hood, you know.

<i>Can I have a pint, eh?</i>

04:11.426 --> 04:12.360

04:14.426 --> 04:15.593
‐ Hello.
‐ Hi.

04:15.660 --> 04:19.026
I have a first class ticket
on flight 462

04:19.093 --> 04:21.760
tomorrow to London, and I'd like
to purchase a second ticket

04:21.826 --> 04:23.293
for a very special companion.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.093
I'd be happy to check
the availability for you, sir.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.326
Mm, thank you.

04:27.393 --> 04:30.093
Oh, you're in luck. We only have
one seat left in first class..

04:30.160 --> 04:33.293
...at, uh, $4168.

04:35.026 --> 04:36.959

04:38.493 --> 04:40.426
Why don't you check on coach?

04:46.226 --> 04:47.593
What's up with the boxes?

04:47.660 --> 04:51.060
Well, I‐I went up to Synclaire's
room and I started to reminisce

04:51.126 --> 04:52.760
about all the good times
that we'd had

04:52.826 --> 04:55.860
and I see now her precious
little things still there

04:55.926 --> 04:57.293
which was just too painful.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.226
Help me move this crap
to the basement.

05:00.326 --> 05:02.066
Now, hold up, now,
you must have an agenda

05:02.133 --> 05:03.566

05:03.633 --> 05:05.566
Hi‐hi.

Khadijah, this is Candice,
our new roommate.

05:11.133 --> 05:15.900
Candice, the one
I told you about.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.000
Charmed.

05:19.066 --> 05:21.866
‐ Hate the decor, love the room.
‐ Oh.

05:21.933 --> 05:24.166
Isn't she adorable?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.433
[giggles]

05:27.500 --> 05:29.166
‐ Candy girl, give us a minute.
‐ Sure.

05:29.233 --> 05:30.333
In the kitchen.

05:31.133 --> 05:32.233
Kisses.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.733
No. No, no.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.100
But you just met her.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.900
And yet I feel like I've
known her too many damn years.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.466
Khadijah, now she needs us.

05:48.533 --> 05:52.600
I..
She considers me her mentor.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.100
Clearly the girl has issues.

05:55.666 --> 05:58.366
Alright, fine. But from where
I stand you've got two choices.

05:58.433 --> 05:59.866
You either come up
with a new roommate

05:59.933 --> 06:01.973
by tomorrow,
or you pay 2/3 of the rent

06:02.040 --> 06:05.240
because I am not dippin'
into my Chanel budget.

06:05.306 --> 06:06.473
Look, Coco.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.440
Now I don't wanna live
alone with you.

06:08.506 --> 06:11.840
But this new roommate is gonna
be somebody we both agree on.

06:11.906 --> 06:13.840
Quick question, ladies.

06:13.906 --> 06:16.840
Are we married to that tacky,
little writing desk?

06:18.306 --> 06:21.373
"Give us a minute." What part
of that does she not understand?

06:24.606 --> 06:27.973
That right, there is Lanai,
the pineapple island.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.473
Over here is Maui,
the valley island

06:30.540 --> 06:34.473
and over here, well, I don't
know what that island is

06:34.540 --> 06:37.573
but got a lot of red dirt
and goats on that thing.

06:39.706 --> 06:42.206
Oh, Obie, this whole trip
is like destiny.

06:42.273 --> 06:44.440
What could, what could possible
compare to this?

06:44.506 --> 06:46.606
We've got the beautiful
tropical islands.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.506
Look at all this clear blue
water. Oh.

06:49.573 --> 06:50.906
Oh, and you.

06:50.973 --> 06:53.906
The man I will someday
share a walker with.

06:53.973 --> 06:55.740
Well, um, hop along over here

06:55.806 --> 06:57.373
and plant one on me, mama.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.646
‐ Okay, here come that.
‐ Alright, don't trip yourself.

07:00.713 --> 07:01.646

07:02.546 --> 07:04.046

07:05.946 --> 07:08.580
Shuffle board starts
at exactly ten minutes

07:08.646 --> 07:11.546
and I will not have my perfect
attendance record sullied

07:11.613 --> 07:14.480
by a couple of horny slackers.

07:14.546 --> 07:16.280
Who are you?

07:16.346 --> 07:17.580
Agnes Finch.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.646
Your jovial social director.

07:20.713 --> 07:23.913
Hence, your highly evolved
social skills.

07:25.346 --> 07:27.513
Oh, I'm gonna be watchin' you,
pretty boy.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.613
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.513
‐ Mm‐mm‐mm.
‐ So, Maxine.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.746
‐ Mm?
‐ I have a surprise for you.

07:34.813 --> 07:36.513
Oh no. Uh‐uh.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.246
Please, that last time
was a surprise, Kyle.

07:38.313 --> 07:39.480
[laughing]

07:50.546 --> 07:52.646
Is this what I think it is?

07:52.713 --> 07:56.780
I believe it is a one way ticket
to London, yes.

07:56.846 --> 07:59.620
Oh!
You beautiful man!

08:00.853 --> 08:04.486
Oh, my God, you're actually
going to stay for me.

08:04.553 --> 08:05.786
Oh, man!

08:05.853 --> 08:07.920
Hey, w‐what‐what‐what‐what
should we do with your ticket?

08:07.986 --> 08:09.286
Uh, we, should we, uh,
pop it in the oven

08:09.353 --> 08:10.786
and turn it
into London broil, huh?

08:10.853 --> 08:11.786
‐ Max.
‐ Just rip this.

08:11.853 --> 08:13.586
[growling]

08:13.653 --> 08:15.286
Ma‐Ma‐Max, Max, Max.

08:15.353 --> 08:17.886
This isn't my ticket.
It's for you.

08:17.953 --> 08:20.820
What are you talkin' about?

08:20.886 --> 08:24.186
I want you to come to London,
with me, to live.

08:24.253 --> 08:27.320
Are you out of
your mind, man?

08:27.386 --> 08:28.353
Excuse me?

08:28.420 --> 08:31.586
What did you expect me,
to pick up and go?

08:31.653 --> 08:33.953
Leave my career, my friends

08:34.020 --> 08:37.785
to hop across the pond
and be your little chippy?

08:39.419 --> 08:42.653
Okay, not quite the reaction
I expected.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.886
Um, Maxine, it's a chance for us
to have a new start.

08:45.953 --> 08:47.253
Oh, no, it's not.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.886
It's a chance for you to move up
the corporate ladder

08:49.953 --> 08:53.686
while <i>I sit in your flat,</i>
<i>watching the telly.</i>

08:53.753 --> 08:56.253
How selfishly you.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.853
Maxine, I thought that
you were ready to commit.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.893
‐ I thought you were.
‐ Baby, I am committed.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.626
This ticket is
non‐refundable.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.660
You said,
"I love you."

09:06.726 --> 09:10.260
Well, "I love you" was supposed
to keep your ass here.

09:13.226 --> 09:16.026
Alright, Maxine,
the plane leaves

09:16.093 --> 09:18.526
tomorrow evening, huh?

09:18.593 --> 09:23.026
I suggest you take the remaining
time to think about

09:23.093 --> 09:26.993
what you will be missing
if you do not go.

09:33.326 --> 09:36.093
And I suggest

09:36.160 --> 09:38.260
you think about

09:38.326 --> 09:40.626
what you'll be missing

09:40.693 --> 09:44.060
if...you..

09:44.126 --> 09:45.393
...do.

09:53.726 --> 09:54.693
[glass shattering]

10:07.500 --> 10:08.633
Max!

10:08.700 --> 10:11.200
Max, what the hell
are you doing?

10:11.266 --> 10:12.400
Freak him.

10:12.466 --> 10:15.300
Freak him, freak him.

10:16.900 --> 10:17.833
What..

10:17.900 --> 10:18.866
[screams]
Ah!

10:21.500 --> 10:23.700
If you wanna live

10:23.766 --> 10:25.433
put the bunny down.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.566
Down!

10:33.433 --> 10:35.733
If you're my girls, you'll go
through the fire with me.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.633
Come on, help me
pick up this sofa.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.000
‐ Lift it up, let's go!
‐ No, don't.

10:40.066 --> 10:41.733
[grunting]

10:41.800 --> 10:43.866
Come on, now.

10:43.933 --> 10:45.700
Sit your narrow butt down
and tell us

10:45.766 --> 10:47.233
what's going on
with you and Kyle.

10:49.133 --> 10:50.400
Freak him.

10:52.066 --> 10:53.533
Freak that

10:53.600 --> 10:55.433
freakity freakity frack.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.506
Okay, well, that can
only mean one thing.

11:00.573 --> 11:03.040
Kyle is moving to London
and leaving you.

11:03.106 --> 11:06.073
So much for your
interpretation skills.

11:06.140 --> 11:08.573
He wants me to go with him.

11:10.206 --> 11:11.473
For real?

11:14.173 --> 11:16.773
He thinks that we should
live together.

11:17.973 --> 11:20.740
Like some sort of...couple.

11:22.106 --> 11:23.673
[babbles]

11:23.740 --> 11:26.273
Come on, Max,
why is that such a bad thing?

11:26.340 --> 11:29.473
I mean, three years ago I would
have thought this was crazy.

11:29.540 --> 11:33.140
But it's obvious you guys
can't stay away from each other.

11:33.206 --> 11:35.273
So, I‐I mean,
wh‐what am I supposed to do?

11:35.340 --> 11:39.706
Just follow him like some sort
of 50's housewife?

11:39.773 --> 11:42.806
G‐g‐give up everything
I've worked for?

11:42.873 --> 11:43.840
Oh!

11:43.906 --> 11:44.840
Oh.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.073
Okay, um, Max.

11:51.140 --> 11:55.173
Now, this may sound like
I'm dumping on you

11:55.240 --> 11:57.906
but it‐it‐it comes
from the heart.

11:59.506 --> 12:00.813
You got nothing.

12:04.213 --> 12:05.513
[groaning]

12:05.580 --> 12:06.513
[screams]

12:06.580 --> 12:07.946
Open up the window.

12:08.013 --> 12:09.613
This diva is cleared
for take‐off.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.613
[screams]

12:15.813 --> 12:16.946
No, wait a minute.

12:17.013 --> 12:20.246
I'm trying to help you
out, Max.

12:20.313 --> 12:24.580
Success is nothing,
without someone you love

12:24.646 --> 12:26.046
to share it with.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.346
Would you stop
quoting "Mahogany?"

12:29.413 --> 12:30.580
And tell me wh‐what do you know?

12:30.646 --> 12:33.446
What do you know
about heartbreak?

12:33.513 --> 12:36.746
What do I know
about heartbreak?

12:36.813 --> 12:40.180
What do I know
about heartbreak?

12:40.246 --> 12:41.880
Okay.

12:41.946 --> 12:43.613
Wrap this up.
Y'all gettin' me dizzy.

12:45.446 --> 12:49.880
At the wedding, Desmond Howard,
he‐he pulled me into his web

12:49.946 --> 12:51.746
and then he cast me
off, right?

12:51.813 --> 12:56.146
Because I reminded him too much
of his <i>ex‐girlfriend.</i>

12:56.213 --> 12:58.313
And what do you think
he gave me

12:58.380 --> 13:00.853
to wipe away my tears?

13:00.920 --> 13:03.520
His stank autograph.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.753
You picked up that man
last night.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.320
I lived and breathed Kyle Barker

13:14.386 --> 13:16.186
for three years.

13:16.253 --> 13:19.020
I gave Desmond
my real phone number.

13:20.753 --> 13:23.586
I told Kyle I loved him.

13:23.653 --> 13:25.920
‐ You didn't.
‐ Yes, she did.

13:27.686 --> 13:30.853
‐ Ooh, girl, aw, I'm sorry, oh.
‐ Oh.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.386
‐ Oh, you need some love, oh.
‐ Oh, yes, I do.

13:35.786 --> 13:37.720
I got a grey hair.

13:38.686 --> 13:41.086
I'm not old enough
for grey hair.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.986
I'm too young
to be old.

13:44.053 --> 13:47.020
It's always about you,
isn't it, Khadijah?

13:47.086 --> 13:50.920
Max and I are trying
to weather a man crisis

13:50.986 --> 13:52.753
and all you can think about

13:52.820 --> 13:56.453
is your stupid grey hair.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.953
By the way, you got two.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.626
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Uh‐huh.

14:03.693 --> 14:04.726
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Yeah, see that?

14:04.793 --> 14:06.026
[laughing]

14:06.093 --> 14:07.460
‐ That's what I'm talkin' about.
‐ Yeah, see?

14:07.526 --> 14:08.960
Them handy man callouses

14:09.026 --> 14:10.193
kinda stimulate
the skin, now, don't they?

14:10.260 --> 14:12.093
Yes, they do.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.126
You go. You..

14:13.193 --> 14:14.193
Move it, move it, move it.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.393
Let's go, let's go.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.393
Come on now.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:17.460 --> 14:18.960
Move it, move it.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.260
I am not getting
any younger.

14:28.026 --> 14:29.560
The Jones'.

14:29.626 --> 14:33.860
I spotted your names on the
roster for tonight's <i>luau.</i>

14:33.926 --> 14:36.493
I assume you've been
briefed on the rules.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.226
Rules? For a <i>luau?</i>

14:38.293 --> 14:42.193
We depart at exactly
1900 hours.

14:42.260 --> 14:43.760
No latecomers.

14:43.826 --> 14:45.626
We land on a remote beach

14:45.693 --> 14:48.193
accessible only by sea.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.160
There will be no straggling

14:50.226 --> 14:52.426
from the designated
luau perimeters

14:52.493 --> 14:53.860
which are clearly marked

14:53.926 --> 14:56.726
by plastic Tiki torches.

14:56.793 --> 14:58.593
All seating

14:58.660 --> 15:01.300
is pre‐assigned.

15:01.366 --> 15:04.500
Well, we‐we‐we‐we
are together, right?

15:04.566 --> 15:06.700
That information is on
a need to know basis.

15:08.633 --> 15:12.300
With all due respect, Ms. Finch,
you, uh, turnin' our honeymoon

15:12.366 --> 15:14.500
into some kind of
floatin' boot camp.

15:15.766 --> 15:18.000
Well, if you're having
a problem

15:18.066 --> 15:19.733
with my methods

15:19.800 --> 15:20.866
you're more than welcome

15:20.933 --> 15:23.366
to speak to the captain
about it.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.000
But I wouldn't get
my hopes up.

15:26.066 --> 15:27.733
He's scared to death
of me.

15:29.066 --> 15:30.333
<i>Mahalo.</i>

15:35.100 --> 15:37.100
I wonder how big a splash
she'd make.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.833
Right, and if you take the room

15:40.900 --> 15:42.566
you will have
full run of the house.

15:42.633 --> 15:46.000
We'll even unlock
the 9‐7‐6 numbers.

15:46.066 --> 15:47.200
Ah.

15:47.266 --> 15:48.866
[sighs]

15:48.933 --> 15:50.566
Come on, nana.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.833
Please?

15:54.900 --> 15:56.333
Alright.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.766
Peace out.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.840
Yo, yo.

16:00.906 --> 16:02.140
Yo, yo, Russ, man‐man,
wh‐wh‐what

16:02.206 --> 16:03.273
what's up with this?

16:03.340 --> 16:05.406
"It's been a party,
now get the hell out."

16:06.973 --> 16:08.973
Yeah, man, that's your
eviction notice.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.306
Trip, you were only supposed to
crash in my couch for a week.

16:12.373 --> 16:15.773
Now you're nestin'.
Toodaloo.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.773
What? Whoa.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.506
Russ, Russ.

16:18.573 --> 16:21.340
Bruh, come on, man, I thought
we were tighter than that.

16:21.406 --> 16:23.040
I mean I cook, I clean

16:23.106 --> 16:25.906
I hook you up
with all those video babes.

16:25.973 --> 16:30.140
For which I curse you every time
I pass the free clinic.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.806
Hey, listen, now, hey, hey,
I warned you about those twins.

16:32.873 --> 16:34.606
Trip, Trip, you know what?

16:34.673 --> 16:36.740
I think this is your
lucky day.

16:36.806 --> 16:37.806
I'm desperate.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.440
Khadijah, are you
hittin' on me?

16:40.506 --> 16:43.040
I said desperate,
not drunk.

16:43.106 --> 16:44.840
Now, look,
Synclaire moved out

16:44.906 --> 16:46.473
and I gotta fill her spot.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.173
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
ho‐ho‐hold up.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.873
Are you sayin' that
I would get my own room

16:50.940 --> 16:52.073
and I wouldn't
have to worry about

16:52.140 --> 16:54.173
watching Jamaican soap operas
every mornin'?

16:54.240 --> 16:56.573
Khadijah, if you
give me that spot

16:56.640 --> 16:59.513
I will give you
a pedicure every day.

17:00.846 --> 17:04.246
Sorry, but nobody touch
these toes but my man.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.780
Well, when I had a man.

17:07.846 --> 17:10.713
Damn it, I don't got no man.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.846
‐ Anyway, look, there's a catch.
‐ What's up?

17:12.913 --> 17:15.413
‐ We got to run this by Regine.
‐ Regine?

17:15.480 --> 17:17.246
A man? Living here?

17:17.313 --> 17:19.313
‐ Not gonna happen.
‐ Oh, come on, now.

17:19.380 --> 17:20.980
It's not like he's
a stranger.

17:21.046 --> 17:22.613
I interviewed him twice
for 'Flavor.'

17:22.680 --> 17:25.613
‐ Didn't you read the articles?
‐ Was I in them?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.946
Come on, Regine,
I've known him for a while.

17:29.013 --> 17:32.913
‐ He's a friend of Russell's.
‐ Oh, strike one.

17:35.046 --> 17:38.646
Khadijah, you are missing
the big picture.

17:38.713 --> 17:41.413
Any man, livin'
under this roof

17:41.480 --> 17:43.380
is bound to fall

17:43.446 --> 17:46.146
in love with me.

17:46.213 --> 17:49.880
Regine, you are being crazy.

17:49.946 --> 17:51.980
Oh, you know that.
No, no.

17:52.046 --> 17:53.713
You know that I'm right.

17:53.780 --> 17:56.413
If‐if Max had two percent
more testosterone

17:56.480 --> 17:57.580
she'd be hittin' on me.

17:57.646 --> 17:58.880
Oh.

18:00.386 --> 18:02.320
[knocking on door]

18:05.053 --> 18:06.520
‐ Trip.
‐ Hey, wassup, baby girl?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.520
Hi.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.686
Now, this is a nice crib.

18:11.753 --> 18:12.920
And you must be Regine.

18:12.986 --> 18:14.520
Enough of the niceties.

18:14.586 --> 18:17.453
Let the interview begin.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.620
(Regine)
'Sit, don't flop.'

18:20.986 --> 18:23.386
First of all..

18:23.453 --> 18:26.286
...what the hell
kind of name is Trip?

18:26.353 --> 18:29.353
Oh, it's, uh, it's short for
Ira Lee Williams the Third.

18:29.420 --> 18:30.620
[chuckles]

18:30.686 --> 18:32.786
Y‐you know, the Third?

18:33.953 --> 18:35.220
Triple?

18:36.553 --> 18:37.820
Trip?

18:42.086 --> 18:44.220
How very country.

18:47.086 --> 18:48.253
Well, I'll tell you what,
for now

18:48.320 --> 18:51.786
we're just gonna go with Ira.

18:51.853 --> 18:53.386
'Career ambitions?'

18:53.453 --> 18:55.786
Oh, oh, to, um..

18:55.853 --> 18:59.153
...to write a song
that‐that makes women weep

18:59.220 --> 19:01.260
that makes wanna men
wanna comfort them and

19:01.326 --> 19:02.793
that puts a Jag
in my driveway.

19:02.860 --> 19:05.793
[laughing]

19:10.660 --> 19:13.160
Oh, this is just delightful,
a starving artist.

19:13.226 --> 19:14.660
This interview is over.

19:14.726 --> 19:16.093
Well, well, no, no, no,
no, no, oh, no.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.393
Hold‐hold up, hold up.
I mean, I got a steady gig.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.560
I mean, y‐you're lookin' at
the brother behind

19:20.626 --> 19:23.326
Eastman Brown's
top advertising jingles.

19:23.393 --> 19:25.626
Check it out, check it out,
ahem, ahem, ahem.

19:25.693 --> 19:29.526
♪ Oh she's a woman ♪

19:29.593 --> 19:32.293
♪ A pretty woman ♪

19:32.360 --> 19:35.060
♪ There's beauty in a bottle ♪

19:35.126 --> 19:40.093

19:40.160 --> 19:41.926
Now in a convenient
value‐sized pump.

19:41.993 --> 19:42.960
Ah.

19:45.593 --> 19:46.593
'Okay, you're losing her.'

19:46.660 --> 19:47.760
You better show
your list of references

19:47.826 --> 19:49.093
before you flat line.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.526
Oh, well, she's not interested
in what Quincy Jones

19:52.593 --> 19:56.026
R. Kelly
and Babyface had to say.

19:59.260 --> 20:02.266
I'm not impressed with your
little name droppin'.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.700
Unless, of course, you have
their home phone numbers.

20:04.766 --> 20:07.033
Home phone, car phone
and for R. Kelly

20:07.100 --> 20:08.266
a shower phone.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.866
Now if a woman answers
you might wanna hang up.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.100
And you might wanna
use a mobile

20:11.166 --> 20:13.433
just in case they got
star 69 or something.

20:17.866 --> 20:19.500
‐ Approved.
‐ Alright.

20:19.566 --> 20:22.433
But on a probationary basis.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.666
If you commit
even a single infraction

20:25.733 --> 20:29.566
you and your bag of jingles
will be out on the street.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.766
Well, ladies.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.266
I think we got a family here.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.600
[laughs]

20:35.666 --> 20:38.600
[insects chirping]

20:42.866 --> 20:47.500
Well, baby, we, uh, definitely
made our mark on this island.

20:47.566 --> 20:49.866
Although I wished we had stayed
at the luau a little longer.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.966
You know, I've always wanted to
see a man in a loincloth

20:52.033 --> 20:54.466
shake his groove thing
over a fire.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.873
‐ The night's still young, baby.
‐ Yes, it is.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.473
[foghorn blowing]

21:01.540 --> 21:05.773
Um. That's the sound I've never
got out of you before.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.973
Obie, I think that was
our ship leaving.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.106
Oh, no, baby, that's just
a little warning

21:10.173 --> 21:12.140
to get everybody back on board,
that's all.

21:12.206 --> 21:13.306
[foghorn blowing]

21:14.706 --> 21:17.040
A theory which fails
to explain

21:17.106 --> 21:19.140
why our ship
is headed out to sea.

21:19.206 --> 21:20.140
God.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.406
O‐Obie, you‐you mean
we're stranded?

21:23.473 --> 21:25.440
On a deserted island?

21:25.506 --> 21:27.340
Well, technically, baby

21:27.406 --> 21:30.573
it won't be deserted
until we're dead.

21:42.473 --> 21:45.340
Look, Coco, now.

21:45.406 --> 21:47.706
I don't wanna live alone
with you either, okay?

21:47.773 --> 21:50.273
But this new ra..

21:50.340 --> 21:52.473
Now, look, Coco.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.973
Okay? I don't wanna live alone
with you easer.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.740
‐ Eas..
‐ What? What did you say?

21:56.806 --> 21:58.073
What did you say? What?

21:58.140 --> 21:59.880
Coco.

21:59.946 --> 22:01.846
Now I don't feel like living
alone with you either.

22:01.913 --> 22:04.046
But we both have to agree upon
the next roommate

22:04.113 --> 22:06.080
because therefore, after that,
and furthermore‐‐

22:06.146 --> 22:08.280
Oh, God!

22:08.346 --> 22:10.680
Can't get that line out.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.813
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo.</i>

22:11.880 --> 22:12.813
[giggles]

22:12.880 --> 22:15.813
[instrumental music]
