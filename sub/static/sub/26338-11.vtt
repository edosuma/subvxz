WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:05.744
Three, two, one. Vegas! Ah!Vegas!

00:05.788 --> 00:07.442
Hold on. Let me try that again.No, no. It's a good one.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.010
Let me see it.It's a keeper. Trust me.

00:10.053 --> 00:13.361
And with that, the seven-year
Manniversary trip to Sin City

00:13.404 --> 00:15.145
is officially underway!

00:15.189 --> 00:16.886
Congratulations.Yeah.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.801
I don't mean
to dampen your mood, but

00:18.844 --> 00:21.673
pretty sure I met you seven
and a halfyears ago, 'cause...

00:21.717 --> 00:23.414
Yeah, but the Manniversary
doesn't commemorate

00:23.458 --> 00:24.807
the first time we met, dude.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.417
It's commemorates

00:26.461 --> 00:28.724
the first time you stopped being
annoying, remember? 'Cause,

00:28.767 --> 00:30.769
like, for the first six months,
I wanted to kick your ass.

00:30.813 --> 00:31.944
Like, I really wanted
to choke you out.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.381
Remember?I'm glad you clarified that.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.296
Anytime. Now,
straighten your tie.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.341
Let's go get a lint roller
going or something.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.560
I don't know what's
going on here.

00:38.603 --> 00:39.865
And where's your hat?

00:39.909 --> 00:41.258
I thought we were doing
the Rat Pack thing.

00:41.302 --> 00:42.607
Let's go.I don't know about the hat.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.870
But I do dig the Rat Pack vibe.
I love the suits.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.003
But why are we already
wearing them?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.179
'Cause we want to
show up in style.

00:49.223 --> 00:52.095
Like real men. That's what real
men do when they go to Vegas.

00:52.139 --> 00:55.185
Show that we mean business the
minute our feet hit the Strip.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.100
Real men show up
in wrinkled suits?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.538
I brought a
portable steamer.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.975
Oh.
Yeah, I got it
all covered.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.891
All you have to do
is sit back, relax,

01:05.935 --> 01:08.111
and enjoy some
well-deserved time off.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.026
Yeah, until Matty calls us in
for another mission.

01:10.070 --> 01:10.983
I got that
covered, too.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.637
All I had to do was explain

01:12.681 --> 01:13.943
the sacred nature
of the Manniversary,

01:13.986 --> 01:15.292
and she promised me

01:15.336 --> 01:16.641
she wouldn't call us
unless we're the only ones

01:16.685 --> 01:18.121
standing in the way
of the apocalypse.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.122
I don't mean
like the end of the world.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.863
I mean the zombie
apocalypse.

01:20.906 --> 01:21.951
The real one.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.083
Oh.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.041
Get fired up.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.956
All right.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.176
Vegas!

01:29.219 --> 01:31.221
Baby, let's go.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.919
♪ Bright light city
gonna set my soul... ♪

01:33.963 --> 01:36.705
JACK: First, we're gonna
check in at the Excalibur,

01:36.748 --> 01:39.055
where I've reserved the
much-coveted Lancelot Suite.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.101
Then we begin our tour

01:41.144 --> 01:43.320
of the best buffets
on the Strip.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.148
Spoiler alert:
there's eight of 'em.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.019
Followed up by a ride

01:47.063 --> 01:49.196
on the fastest roller
coaster in Las Vegas.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.155
Wait, wait. Y-You want
to ride a roller coaster

01:52.199 --> 01:53.765
after we've eaten
at eight buffets?

01:53.809 --> 01:55.332
Mm, I love a
good challenge.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.813
Then we put that
big brain of yours

01:57.856 --> 01:59.293
to work on the
blackjack table.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.338
Nope. We talked about this.
Counting cards is cheating.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.253
If you get caught.
We're not gonna get caught.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.429
Stop interrupting. So, after
we win big on the table,

02:05.473 --> 02:08.128
we're gonna celebrate
with a 32-ounce

02:08.171 --> 02:10.260
bone-in, tomahawk porterhouse.

02:10.304 --> 02:14.134
Yeah, and finally, ending
our first night with

02:14.177 --> 02:16.223
a show, a show
of your choosing.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.398
What?

02:17.441 --> 02:18.921
Mm-hmm.
I get a choice?

02:18.964 --> 02:21.053
Yeah, as long as it's the
Legends of Metal tribute

02:21.097 --> 02:22.664
or the Blue Man Group,
which, really,

02:22.707 --> 02:24.100
I think there is
no choice there.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.754
It's Legends of Metal
the whole way, right?

02:25.797 --> 02:28.670
No argument there.
Nice.

02:28.713 --> 02:32.326
Does this itinerary involve
any pool time

02:32.369 --> 02:34.850
I'd like to do some actual
relaxing on this trip.

02:34.893 --> 02:37.809
JACK: Ah, Mac, we're from SoCal.
We can relax,

02:37.853 --> 02:40.247
soaking up rays
by the pool anytime.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.814
This is Las Vegas, baby.
We got to turn it up!

02:42.858 --> 02:44.164
Except we never do any of that,

02:44.207 --> 02:45.904
'cause anytime
we try to relax...

02:48.342 --> 02:51.127
♪

03:13.280 --> 03:15.499
All right.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.674
Right this way.
Watch your step.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.546
Okay.Uh-huh.

03:18.589 --> 03:21.113
Okay. Open 'em.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.857
I thought we were
going to lunch.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.817
Just a little detour. I wanted
to get your opinion on this

03:28.860 --> 03:30.862
move-in-ready, one bedroom
with covered parking,

03:30.906 --> 03:33.996
coin-operated laundry,
in a very walkable neighborhood.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.563
Are you moving out of Mac's?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.739
Just tell me
what you think.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.524
I mean,

03:40.568 --> 03:41.917
uh...

03:41.960 --> 03:45.181
it's great natural light.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.357
Oh.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.533
But if you're seriously thinking
of moving in here, babe,

03:49.577 --> 03:51.753
there needs to be new
paint, new baseboards.

03:51.796 --> 03:52.884
It needs work.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.104
All easily done.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.889
And I'm seriously
thinking about moving in.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.457
But only
on one condition.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.113
You move in with me.

04:05.506 --> 04:08.639
I've never felt this way
about anyone, Leanna.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.816
And I'm ready to take us
to the next level.

04:11.860 --> 04:12.774
Are you?

04:12.817 --> 04:15.690
Well, uh...

04:15.733 --> 04:17.735
"Well."

04:17.779 --> 04:20.434
Not exactlywhat I was
hoping to hear.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.307
It's a big step, Bozer,

04:24.351 --> 04:27.267
and, uh, you know
I'm not an impulsive woman.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.704
You just caught me
by surprise, so...

04:29.747 --> 04:32.054
I need time to think about it.

04:32.097 --> 04:35.100
Go. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah...

04:35.144 --> 04:37.886
Like five minutes?
Ten

04:40.323 --> 04:42.151
Matty needs us.

04:42.194 --> 04:45.067
Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.247
Sorry. We were just...

04:51.291 --> 04:53.293
Not now, Bozer.
With Mac and Jack

04:53.336 --> 04:55.120
off to Vegas, I'm
sending you three on

04:55.164 --> 04:56.426
a time

04:56.470 --> 04:59.342
This is Naveed Bin Dajani,

04:59.386 --> 05:01.518
member of the royal
Bahraini family

05:01.562 --> 05:04.173
and a suspected terrorist
leader, thought to have

05:04.216 --> 05:05.653
over a dozen cells
around the globe.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.132
Phoenix just
intercepted intel

05:07.176 --> 05:09.091
that he's been transporting data

05:09.134 --> 05:11.049
detailing his network's
illicit finances

05:11.093 --> 05:13.269
to bankers in Western Europe.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.271
Bin Dajani won't get caught

05:15.315 --> 05:16.664
with this data himself,
so his niece,

05:16.707 --> 05:19.710
Princess Zahra,
has agreed to play courier.

05:19.754 --> 05:22.887
Everything we need to crush
his network is in her hands,

05:22.931 --> 05:23.888
or rather,

05:23.932 --> 05:25.934
shall I say, around her neck.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.849
Interesting place
for a hard drive.

05:27.892 --> 05:31.287
The data isn't on a hard drive.
It's been encoded onto this.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.942
Her diamond necklace?
That's a seriously huge rock.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.291
6.4 carats.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.945
Worth 200 grand

05:36.988 --> 05:38.773
to any jeweler,
but priceless to us

05:38.816 --> 05:40.383
because Bin Dajani used
a new technology

05:40.427 --> 05:42.167
to encode

05:42.211 --> 05:44.082
his network's data
onto the gem.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.693
How is that even possible?

05:45.736 --> 05:49.436
Colored lasers negatively charge
tiny defects in the--

05:49.479 --> 05:51.263
You know what?
Ask Mac when he's back.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.482
The bottom line is

05:52.526 --> 05:54.397
the tech works,
and the data

05:54.441 --> 05:57.095
in her possession
needs to be in ours.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.183
LEANNA:
Okay, so what's the plan?

05:58.227 --> 05:59.446
The princess is meeting

05:59.489 --> 06:01.535
with her uncle's bankers
in Zurich

06:01.578 --> 06:03.450
in 72 hours, but as a cover,

06:03.493 --> 06:06.366
her trip starts with a two-day
shopping spree in Milan.

06:06.409 --> 06:09.543
The princess booked a hotel
suite where couture designers

06:09.586 --> 06:12.415
will privately show her
their latest collections.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.591
You three will infiltrate
the suite,

06:14.635 --> 06:15.897
copy the data off the diamond,

06:15.940 --> 06:17.899
and then permanently erase it
off the stone.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.161
So we're stealing
the information

06:19.204 --> 06:21.032
without anyone ever
knowing what happened.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.817
Yup.And we're going undercover

06:22.860 --> 06:24.645
as what, fashionistas?

06:24.688 --> 06:25.994
BOZER:
Hell yeah!

06:26.037 --> 06:27.996
Sounds like a trip
to Rodeo Drive is in order.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.998
Gonna need some new clothes
to blend in with all the...

06:30.041 --> 06:31.347
All you'll need

06:31.391 --> 06:33.480
are black polyester pants
and a matching vest.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.090
You'll be working as

06:35.133 --> 06:37.353
hotel caterers during the
princess's private showings.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.528
RILEY:
And how exactly

06:38.572 --> 06:40.008
are we doing this
copying and erasing?

06:40.051 --> 06:41.488
Our lab techs specially designed

06:41.531 --> 06:44.316
this diamond scanner
and degausser.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.406
So just connect
the diamond,

06:46.449 --> 06:48.625
plug your USB into a tablet,

06:48.669 --> 06:50.453
and the encoded data
will be uploaded

06:50.497 --> 06:52.586
to a Phoenix server,
and then permanently

06:52.629 --> 06:54.892
erased off the stone.
Okay.

06:54.936 --> 06:55.850
Wheels up in 20.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.895
Ciao, bellas.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.463
That means bye-bye.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.465
[clanking, high-pitched
electrical whirring]

07:19.264 --> 07:20.875
Jack.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.920
Jack!

07:22.964 --> 07:24.748
Jack.

07:26.141 --> 07:29.144
You okay?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.102
I don't know.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.756
I don't know.
I think so.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.758
What the hell
is this place?

07:34.802 --> 07:36.020
Some sort of prison?

07:38.370 --> 07:39.894
Or worse.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.339
It's no use.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.472
The shackles are
a carbon alloy.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.648
They're what?They're really, really strong.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.214
So I can't break 'em?

07:56.258 --> 07:57.433
Well, you could've
mentioned that

07:57.477 --> 07:58.608
before I wore myself out.
Thanks a lot.

08:00.392 --> 08:03.265
You know, I'm feeling
really woozy here.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.658
You know,
like I got a hangover.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.789
You feel like
you got a hangover?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.008
What is that?Yeah.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.705
My head is throbbing, and...Yeah.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.577
...judging by the taste
in my mouth...

08:12.056 --> 08:13.493
...pretty sure

08:13.536 --> 08:15.930
the filters in these gas masks
were dipped in ketamine.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.409
So they drugged us?

08:17.453 --> 08:18.759
There you go.
That makes sense.

08:18.802 --> 08:19.760
That's how they knocked us out

08:19.803 --> 08:21.675
for transport right there.
Oh, boy.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.720
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this one, buddy.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.418
I'm telling you, man, somebody
really planned this out.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.290
Jack.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.947
They took our belts,
they took our socks,

08:32.990 --> 08:34.644
they took our shoes;
why would they leave you that?

08:34.688 --> 08:36.951
It doesn't make sense.
Whoever did this,
No.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.126
if they wanted us dead,
they could've killed us.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.041
Shot us.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.564
If they wanted intel,
they could've chained us

08:41.608 --> 08:43.958
to a chair and interrogated us,
not have us shackled

08:44.001 --> 08:46.569
in whatever the hell
this place is.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.790
You know what
this reminds me of?

08:49.833 --> 08:52.227
That movie, Saw.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.837
Remember that one?

08:53.881 --> 08:56.057
Like, at any time,
I feel like

08:56.100 --> 08:58.102
that creepy clown's gonna come
riding in here

08:58.146 --> 09:01.366
on a tricycle and ask us
if we want to play a game.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.804
Probably not, but

09:03.847 --> 09:05.936
I say we get out of here
before we find out.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.372
In case you hadn't noticed...

09:12.290 --> 09:14.379
Yup, just what
I thought.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.946
We...

09:15.990 --> 09:17.034
We can't even reach
the door, bro.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.427
All right, first
things first.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.733
We ditch these chains.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.908
Great.

09:31.222 --> 09:34.095
Hey, uh, Jack.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.967
Hmm?Come here.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.927
The vent.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.807
There's a camera in there.Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm trying to say.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.287
And so, how do you want
to play this?

09:52.330 --> 09:53.810
We act like
we don't see it, or...?

09:53.854 --> 09:55.203
Hey, hey,
whosever watching!

09:55.246 --> 09:56.857
Ha, ha, ha, we get it.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.598
Very funny. Joke's on us.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.991
I tell you what. Come in here,
and we'll have a little chat.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.776
Okay? We can
work this out like adults.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.951
This is ridiculous!

10:03.994 --> 10:06.214
I'm glad
we talked that out first.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.476
Uh, it's worth a try.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.347
Debatable.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.566
Come on!

10:15.702 --> 10:18.139
Wait a second.
I know what this is.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.444
This is an underground
fallout shelter,

10:19.488 --> 10:20.968
which means we're still
in the United States.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.231
Yeah, but where in the U.S.?
And that's not the only

10:23.274 --> 10:24.667
unanswered question.
I'd kind of like to know

10:24.711 --> 10:26.321
why someone would do
this to us, huh?

10:26.364 --> 10:29.193
Whoever it was went to great
lengths to set this all up.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.589
Oh.

10:33.633 --> 10:38.028
Well, this is definitely not the
five-star buffet at the Luxor.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.247
Tell you that much.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.688
Hey, Mac.

10:45.732 --> 10:49.953
Why would there be
an Indonesian food delicacy

10:49.997 --> 10:52.129
in an old, dirty
U.S. bomb shelter?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.740
I mean, correct me
if I'm wrong, but

10:53.783 --> 10:55.785
aren't these sago worms
right here?

10:56.873 --> 10:58.048
Sago worms?Yeah, whatever.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.050
When's the last time
you saw a bowl of these?

11:00.094 --> 11:02.052
Huh?
Uh, Jakarta.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.230
Wait a minute.

11:07.884 --> 11:11.540
You don't think this is somehow
about my first DXS mission,

11:11.583 --> 11:12.672
do you?

11:12.715 --> 11:15.936
This point,
nothing would surprise me.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa, my man.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.592
There must be some sort of
mix-up, because we didn't order

11:20.636 --> 11:22.159
any barbecue worms
at this table.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.074
WAITER: Your friend
sent them over.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.120
My friend?

11:26.163 --> 11:29.863
HADLEY :
Eat up, Jacky boy.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.952
Oh, oh.
Thanks a lot, Hadley.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.128
One of you, uh, DXS wimps
is gonna be the first

11:34.171 --> 11:35.477
to try the sago worm.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.479
My apologies on behalf
of my partner.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.263
His sense of humor is... unique.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.612
MacGYVER:
Believe it or not, Griggs,

11:40.656 --> 11:41.962
I can relate.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.224
HADLEY:
Ten bucks says Dalton's

11:43.267 --> 11:44.312
too scared to try them.

11:44.355 --> 11:45.443
JACK:
No, I'm not scared, Hadley.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.315
I'm just saving 'em
for you.

11:47.358 --> 11:51.145
The CIA's most un-dynamic duo
in history is gonna want

11:51.188 --> 11:52.450
to have a little something
to celebrate

11:52.494 --> 11:54.714
once me and my boy
slap the cuffs on the target.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.237
Ain't that right?HADLEY: You know, at first,

11:56.280 --> 11:58.282
I was excited to do a joint op

11:58.326 --> 11:59.762
with the DXS, but now

11:59.806 --> 12:01.764
I'm starting to wonder
about you black budget boys.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.592
One of you's too scared
to try the local chow.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.289
The other's too scared
to carry a gun?

12:05.333 --> 12:06.856
GRIGGS:
Take it easy, man.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.119
It's the kid's first op.
Let's see what he can do.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.339
But Hadley's right
about one thing, MacGyver.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.993
When you sit down
with a terrorist,

12:13.036 --> 12:15.256
you should be packing
more than a pocket knife.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.475
All right, relax.
It may be the kid's first

12:17.519 --> 12:18.781
clandestine operation,

12:18.825 --> 12:20.043
but it's not
his first op.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.958
You weren't there with us
in Afghanistan.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.395
And when the sago worms
hit the fan, which they...

12:24.439 --> 12:26.658
often do,

12:26.702 --> 12:28.791
our best weapon's gonna be
right between his ears.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.314
Trust me.WALLER: Cut the chatter.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.186
Samrozi's gonna be here
any minute.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.275
Once MacGyver's verified
that that HQ-16

12:34.318 --> 12:37.408
missile system is legit,
Dalton, you get Samrozi

12:37.452 --> 12:39.193
to give up the location
of that weapon.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.064
And then Griggs
and Hadley will move in

12:41.108 --> 12:42.500
and take him down.

12:42.544 --> 12:45.286
And no mistakes.
We got a lot riding on this.

12:45.329 --> 12:48.202
That HQ-16 could take down
a commercial airliner.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.378
Oh. Okay. Here we go, boys.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.163
Elvis has just entered
the building.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.471
Selamat siang,
Samrozi.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.125
Selamat siang, Nigel.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.909
Apa kabar?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.171
Me? Oh, I'm doing great.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.477
Yeah. Thanks.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.826
Uh, let me introduce you

13:03.870 --> 13:06.133
to my associate,
Mr. Derek Smalls.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.702
And this is Yovan.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.096
Hey. Have a seat. Relax.
Boys, have a seat.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.012
So...

13:16.056 --> 13:19.102
Okay. You're just gonna--
Oh, boy.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.931
Sammy, you're just gonna
dive right in there on those.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.672
You got a little something
for us or you just gonna

13:23.715 --> 13:25.065
sit here
and gross us out?

13:29.504 --> 13:31.462
YOVAN:
Manufactured in 2011.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.160
Four HE-frag warheads.

13:33.203 --> 13:36.337
40-kilometer range.
Fully functioning. No damage.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.342
Way to go, Sammy.
So, what's next?

13:41.385 --> 13:44.345
A little in-person look-see
at the merchandise?

13:44.388 --> 13:46.086
You guys could text
us the address.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.174
We'll meet you there.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.698
First, a question.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.833
What have you been doing
since last we met?

13:53.876 --> 13:57.662
Me? Oh, I've been kicking ass
down in South America, baby.

13:57.706 --> 13:58.968
Yeah.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.535
You know, things got a
little slow around here.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.624
We like to go
where the action is.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.017
You know? Ha.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.550
Shooter!

14:20.947 --> 14:22.992
WALLER: Griggs, Hadley,
do you have eyes on Samrozi?

14:24.472 --> 14:25.821
Got him.Let's go!

14:45.014 --> 14:47.364
Nice takedown, Mac.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.628
Yovan's in custody,
all thanks to the, uh,

14:50.672 --> 14:52.108
kid with no experience.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.718
Do we have Samrozi?GRIGGS: Negative.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.764
We lost him
in the crowd.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.114
You know?

14:58.158 --> 15:00.073
Like, we never
caught Samrozi.

15:00.116 --> 15:03.163
So you think ol' Sammy's
trying to get back revenge,

15:03.206 --> 15:04.729
seven years later?

15:04.773 --> 15:07.732
I mean, worms aren't exactly
incriminating evidence, but...

15:07.776 --> 15:09.343
Ah, you know what?
Hey, hey. Samrozi?

15:09.386 --> 15:11.954
This is enough. Come out from
behind the camera and face us.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.303
Be a man. Don't be a coward.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.131
Okay? This-this is stupid.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.481
: Hey, hey.I got it.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.961
Well, no, no.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.397
Do it closer
to the lens.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.921
All right, all right.
Yeah, yeah.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.793
Listen, Samrozi,

15:24.836 --> 15:26.447
I want you to listen to me now.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.188
You are a dirty little man.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.406
No, no, you're a dirty,

15:29.450 --> 15:33.106
ugly, gold-tooth-wearing
little boy!

15:33.149 --> 15:35.760
And I want you to come down here
so I can thank you personally

15:35.804 --> 15:37.153
for throwing me
in here.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.850
I'm gonna start by breaking
every one of your fingers.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.852
Then I'm gonna move up
to your arms, your nose,

15:40.896 --> 15:42.332
your jaw. You're gonna be
sucking soup through a straw

15:42.376 --> 15:43.986
for three weeks, you hear me?

15:44.030 --> 15:46.162
["Mambo Bacan"
by Anna Maria Kaufmann playing]

15:57.173 --> 16:00.742
MARCO: Ah, gorgeous,
Princess. Simply...

16:00.785 --> 16:01.961
gorgeous.You've said that

16:02.004 --> 16:03.788
about all your designs, Marco.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.573
That's only because
you wear them so well.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.967
Mm.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.799
So, what were y'all
talking about?

16:14.843 --> 16:17.106
Uh, the op.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.935
I thought maybe she was asking
your advice about us moving in.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.806
Bozer,

16:21.850 --> 16:23.199
I don't know
what her plans are,

16:23.243 --> 16:25.985
but I'm friends
with the both of you,

16:26.028 --> 16:27.551
so please don't make this weird.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.772
Sorry, Riley. It's just...
you know how I feel about her.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.208
Yeah, I do.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.036
But this is a big step.
You got to give her some time.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.084
So, how are we gonna get
the diamond into the degausser

16:38.127 --> 16:40.651
if Zahra never takes off
her necklace?

16:40.695 --> 16:43.219
No clue.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.875
You there. American expat.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.097
Uh... canapé, Princess?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.533
They're delicious.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.361
You have an opinion
about this dress.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.232
What? No.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.191
Well, you just looked
at me and shook your head.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.106
Everyone here tells
me what they think

17:00.149 --> 17:02.412
I want to hear.
What I want is truth.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.545
So, this dress--

17:04.588 --> 17:06.634
yes or no?

17:07.809 --> 17:09.202
Uh...

17:14.294 --> 17:16.252
It's a hard no.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.124
Yeah, I mean, the
beadwork's amazing,

17:18.167 --> 17:19.864
but the color palette?
I mean, are you going

17:19.908 --> 17:22.128
to a tea party for fairies
and unicorns? Uh, mm-mm.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.826
Well, finally, I hear truth.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.349
Thank you, Marco.
You're dismissed.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.829
Pack everything.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.092
We're leaving. Yeah, great job, Bozer.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
You just convinced her
to cut her trip short.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.182
Now what are we gonna do?

17:33.226 --> 17:34.401
LEANNA: I'll take
out the guards.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.576
One of you grab the necklace.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.621
Uh... wait.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.797
Excuse me?

17:39.841 --> 17:42.713
Uh, actually, Your Highness,
I'm a designer myself.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.063
I only moved to Milan
to pursue fashion.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.586
I do these gigs
to pay the bills

17:45.629 --> 17:48.023
until I land my first
runway show. My friends,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.025
they're models. I'd love
to show you my designs.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.809
I think you'll be blown away.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.985
Can you have them here
in an hour?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.901
The earliest I can bring them
is tomorrow.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.816
But... it'll be worth the wait.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.650
Why not?

18:06.694 --> 18:08.783
We're staying.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.222
:
Oh.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.138
Double-O-Boze
from way downtown.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.661
I just bought us another day.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.924
By promising a fashion show?

18:19.968 --> 18:22.013
How we gonna pull this off?

18:22.057 --> 18:25.495
Didn't I just say
Double

18:25.539 --> 18:27.062
It's in the bow tie.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.896
So, come on down here and
take your beating like a man,

18:34.939 --> 18:36.158
'cause we both know,

18:36.202 --> 18:38.465
in your case, it'll be
a major improvement.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.423
: Hey, Jack.
Ready. Come on.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.083
What are you
cooking there, Mac?Home-brew thermite.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.825
And it'll burn through chains.
Let's do it.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.914
And maybe our feet.Our feet? Come on, dude.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.699
I need my feet.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.963
How we gonna... run out of here
without our feet?

19:06.971 --> 19:08.016
That does not
sound good.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.720
What's that hissing sound?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.075
What is it?It's tear gas.

19:32.997 --> 19:37.001
:
One lives, one dies.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.786
One lives...

19:39.439 --> 19:41.223
...one dies.

19:48.665 --> 19:51.190
What is it

19:53.409 --> 19:55.237
I told you
this is a horror movie.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.639
Mac,

20:05.682 --> 20:07.249
you've been staring
at that door for hours, man.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.642
What are you looking for?

20:08.685 --> 20:10.383
I don't know. I
haven't found it yet.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.472
You know,

20:12.515 --> 20:15.562
I am so hungry.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.999
It's not hunger.What is it?

20:18.042 --> 20:20.393
It's dehydration.Ah.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.742
How long do you think
we've been in here?

20:21.785 --> 20:24.701
I don't know. Like, uh...

20:24.745 --> 20:27.095
36 hours, give or take.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.619
You use facial hair
to tell time?

20:29.663 --> 20:31.273
It's a little trick
I learned in...

20:31.317 --> 20:33.275
sniper school.
It works, actually.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.451
No kidding.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.061
That's genius.

Hey, if you're taking requests,

20:53.295 --> 20:55.166
a little Ozzy
might... be nice.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.255
Maybe some Motorhead.
I don't know.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.343
He's trying to keep us awake.

20:57.386 --> 20:58.518
Yeah, I know.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.084
I went through this
in SERE training.

21:00.128 --> 21:03.000
He's trying to break
us. Question is why.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.306
Why?

21:05.873 --> 21:07.831
One lives, one dies.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.790
He thinks if he...

21:09.833 --> 21:12.793
keeps us in here long enough,
that we'll...

21:12.836 --> 21:14.969
We'll what?

21:15.012 --> 21:16.318
We'll what?

One of us is gonna
shoot the other one?

21:18.364 --> 21:21.062
Mac, come on.
That's insane.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.629
The fatigue
that you're feeling right now

21:22.672 --> 21:24.761
is only gonna get worse.
The longer we go

21:24.805 --> 21:27.764

without sleep,

21:27.808 --> 21:29.810
the more
our-our cognitive function

I actually don't think
that Samrozi's behind all this.

21:52.354 --> 21:55.139
But what about the worms
in Jakarta...?No, I agree,

21:55.183 --> 21:56.445
this is about Jakarta, but...

21:57.490 --> 21:59.405
...all of this,
this is straight

21:59.448 --> 22:02.625
out of the CIA's enhanced
interrogation playbook.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.455
Do you remember
what happened after the cafe?

22:06.499 --> 22:08.849
I'm gonna have to introduce you
to Nikki when we get back.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.503
She's a real egghead,
just like you are.

Why aren't you in there
working on Yovan right now?

22:26.475 --> 22:29.086
Waller pulled rank,
kicked us out.Did what?

22:29.130 --> 22:30.566
Nine years we've been
doing this together.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.046
First time
anyone's ever

22:32.089 --> 22:33.439
said we weren't fast enough.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.571
I'm thinking about
calling Ops Command.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.486
Hey, man, you know I
always got your back,

22:37.530 --> 22:39.401
but I'm not sure this
guy's worth crossing.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.579
You can make this stop anytime!

22:44.972 --> 22:46.103
Hey, Waller...

22:46.147 --> 22:48.497
Just tell me
where to find Samrozi.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.152
Is this normal?Not at all. Waller!

22:51.195 --> 22:53.807
Waller! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

22:53.850 --> 22:56.113
He's playing games.
Okay.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.160
GRIGGS: Look, we all
want the same thing.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.291
This isn't the way to do it.You're right.

23:00.335 --> 23:03.164
We need an answer... now.Oh. Waller.

23:03.207 --> 23:05.253
Put the piece away. I don't know!

23:05.296 --> 23:07.516
Where is Samrozi's warehouse?Waller, put the
piece away, man!

23:07.560 --> 23:08.604
YOVAN:
I don't know where!

23:08.648 --> 23:10.345
Tell me now!I don't know!

23:10.389 --> 23:12.739
All right,
I've had enough of this.You are useless to me.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.784
No. This is over.
You hear me? It's over!

23:14.828 --> 23:16.003
Get your hands off of me!Stop it.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.831
I outrank you!
That is an order.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.223
You can file it under
"Jack don't care."

23:19.267 --> 23:21.487
Give me the gun.
Let go!

23:22.531 --> 23:23.619
Get out.

23:26.579 --> 23:30.887
Our after-action report
was what kicked off the inquiry

23:30.931 --> 23:32.976
that got Waller booted
from the CIA.

23:33.020 --> 23:36.850
Oh, I agree that Waller
became unhinged on that op,

23:36.893 --> 23:39.461
but if this is revenge,
why now, like this?

23:39.505 --> 23:40.854
I-I don't get it.

23:47.513 --> 23:50.211
Hear that?

23:50.254 --> 23:52.779
JACK: What is it?There's power running
through one of those pipes.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.085
Probably a topside generator
for the HVAC system

23:55.129 --> 23:56.870
that's pumping air
into this room.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.438
That helps us how?It's probably gonna get
us through that door.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.091
Oh. That's awesome.

24:01.135 --> 24:03.354
Yeah, but what's not
awesome is the next part.

24:03.398 --> 24:04.791
In order for this to
work, I'm gonna have to

24:04.834 --> 24:06.532
cut power to the HVAC,
which means this room is

24:06.575 --> 24:08.838
going to get
really, really hot.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.624
A trip to the sauna was on
day two of the itinerary anyway.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.887
What do I care?
Just go for it, Mac. Do it.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.454
That's the spirit.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.804
Okay, big dude one and two,
use your big muscles

24:17.847 --> 24:19.240
and move these chairs
out of the way, okay?

24:19.283 --> 24:20.241
I got a show to do.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.332
All right, I got to do
some final touches,

24:24.375 --> 24:26.073
and I'll be right back.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.340
LEANNA: Bozer, when
Matty finds out

24:32.383 --> 24:34.908
you spent 70 grand
on the company card...

24:34.951 --> 24:36.387
her head's gonna explode.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.215
More like the intensity
of her gaze...

24:38.259 --> 24:40.391
will make his head explode.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.872
She's only gonna get mad
if this doesn't work.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.874
And if it doesn't, you'll come
visit me at the Burger Shack

24:44.918 --> 24:46.006
when I'm pulling
the midnight shift

24:46.049 --> 24:47.224
to pay back Phoenix, right?

24:47.268 --> 24:48.574
Maybe.

24:49.618 --> 24:53.274
Or... maybe...

24:53.317 --> 24:56.364
I'll be at our
apartment...

24:56.407 --> 24:58.192
in my PJs...

30:43.102 --> 30:44.843
are taking a lot of heat
out there.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.583
I'm gonna go
and provide support, ASAP.

30:46.627 --> 30:47.758
Negative, Dalton.
Stay with MacGyver.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.195
This op means nothing

30:49.238 --> 30:50.457
if we don't neutralize
that weapon.Yeah, but...

30:53.547 --> 30:54.635
Okay, Griggs, Hadley,
Mac's almost done.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.898
Time to wrap things up.
Let's go.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.900
GRIGGS: Aw, but we finally
have them on the run.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.597
How we doing here?Yeah, done.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.861
WALLER: Copy.
Exfil chopper two minutes out.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.166
All right, Hadley,
Griggs, fall back.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.689
We're getting the hell
out of here right now.

31:05.733 --> 31:06.821
GRIGGS:
Copy that. Falling...

31:10.956 --> 31:12.696
Respond. Fellas,
can you hear me?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.089
Guys, you there

31:14.133 --> 31:15.830
WALLER: Dalton, you've got
more bogeys inbound.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.572
Get out now.Nah, we're not leaving
without Griggs and Hadley.

31:18.615 --> 31:19.878
Yeah, we don't have
the whole family

31:19.921 --> 31:21.140
in the van yet there, boss.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.489
Griggs and Hadley are dead.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.794
Your position is
about to be overrun.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.100
Get to exfil.

31:25.144 --> 31:26.145
No way. We're not
leaving without them.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.450
No!WALLER: That is an order!

31:32.891 --> 31:35.371
JACK:
Griggs and Hadley.

31:35.415 --> 31:39.375
Okay, so-so obviously someone
blames us for their death.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.116
But that means it
can't be Waller,

31:41.160 --> 31:42.639
because we wanted
to save them.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.206
He ordered us out
of the building.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.774
In his mind, this is a friend
of theirs

31:46.817 --> 31:48.732
What?

31:48.776 --> 31:51.735
Figure that out, maybe we
can get that door to open.

31:53.128 --> 31:54.913
I've had enough of this.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.788
Open!

32:06.185 --> 32:07.621
Here we go. Okay,
come here, Mac.

32:07.664 --> 32:08.709
Look, look, look,
this-this has...

32:08.752 --> 32:10.319
got to be
something, right?

32:10.363 --> 32:12.234
You can make something
out of this. A

32:14.497 --> 32:16.369
Unfortunately, after
40-plus years down here,

32:16.412 --> 32:18.414
it's empty.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.723
But it is 50 pounds
of solid steel.

32:24.159 --> 32:28.207
Come on, Mac, I can see
your wheels spinning, bro.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.296
I know you got something.
Just let me know how I can help.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.167
Just tell me.Okay.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.952
All I've got is a Hail Mary.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.171
Whether or not it works

32:36.215 --> 32:38.652
depends entirely... on you.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.572
: Could you please
check up on my necklace?

32:47.878 --> 32:50.359
LEANNA: Riley, are you done

32:50.403 --> 32:51.621
'Cause you're about
to have company.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.540
Where is the necklace?

32:57.584 --> 32:59.412
It's right there.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.153
No.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.632
Yeah.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.460
The diamond pendant.

33:04.504 --> 33:05.635
What is this?

33:08.769 --> 33:09.857
Riley, was that a thump?

33:09.900 --> 33:12.207
Uh, yes. Yes, it was.

33:12.251 --> 33:14.427
And, uh, keep stalling.
Gonna need more time.

33:14.470 --> 33:15.732
Well, hurry, 'cause there's only

33:15.776 --> 33:17.430
so many accessories
we can give her.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.736
Telling you now, Meghan Markle
will be calling you

33:19.780 --> 33:21.042
asking how you look so good.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.652
She'd be like,
"How you look so good?"

33:22.696 --> 33:25.046
You'd have to say,
"Because, girl, I just do."

33:25.090 --> 33:28.006
Just a little longer
to finish erasing the diamond.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.181
ZAHRA:
Okay. Okay.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.183
I've seen this dress
in every light,

33:31.226 --> 33:32.619
from every angle,
with every accoutrement.

33:32.662 --> 33:33.924
I'm taking it off.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.404
But I want to show you
some clutch purses...

33:35.448 --> 33:37.015
Oh, oh, don't worry.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.407
I'm buying it.

33:38.451 --> 33:39.539
Excellent.

33:48.243 --> 33:50.115
Let me help you change,
Princess.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.333
ZAHRA:
Where is Ahmed?

33:52.856 --> 33:54.075
He was supposed
to get my necklace.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.076
RILEY:
He's in the bathroom.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.991
Too many, uh, canapés.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.175
Where is my necklace?

34:07.219 --> 34:08.959
Oh, it's right there.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.747
No, it's not here.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.401
It's not here.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.620
It's not here.
It's not here.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.535
My uncle will kill me
if I lost it.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.758
Oh, my gosh.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.153
It was right here.
He must have dropped it.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.765
BOZER:
Princess Zahra,

34:31.808 --> 34:33.071
it's been a honor.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.202
I don't want to take up
any more of your time,

34:34.246 --> 34:35.856
so thank you again
for this opportunity.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.771
We're gonna go.
Uh, you've been nothing

34:37.814 --> 34:39.207
but a blessing
and a pleasure.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.775
I wish you nothing
but the best in life.

34:41.818 --> 34:42.950
You're most welcome.

34:42.993 --> 34:45.387
Hey.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.389
Ah, we're leaving.

34:47.433 --> 34:48.999
RILEY:
I'll take this off your hands.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.653
All right.ZAHRA: Wait.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.103
For the dress.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.757
Of course.

35:07.801 --> 35:10.891
You know, I got a feeling
that one day soon,

35:10.934 --> 35:13.111
the whole world's gonna be
talking about you.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.895
ZAHRA:
Thank you.

35:14.938 --> 35:16.766
Bye.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.769
Yeah. When she finally gets
outed as a terrorist.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.207
At least she'll be heading
to a black site in style.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.991
Double-O-Boze.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.691
It's working.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.607
Again.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.917
You know, it's actually
kinetic energy

35:36.960 --> 35:39.093
stored in the metal limbs of the
crossbow that fires the bolt,

35:39.137 --> 35:40.921
not the elasticity of the wires.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.618
Mac, will you stop?

35:42.662 --> 35:44.925
Please, just stop.

35:44.968 --> 35:48.233
I-I'm too exhausted
for a science lesson right now.

35:48.276 --> 35:49.712
Okay, bro?

35:54.891 --> 35:55.849
It's working.Slowly.

35:55.892 --> 35:57.459
But, yeah.
Here, bring it back.

36:00.767 --> 36:01.855
Yeah.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.514
Jack!

36:11.256 --> 36:12.953
I can't breathe.

36:15.912 --> 36:20.308
I think the impact broke some of
your ribs, maybe your sternum.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.223
I got a punctured lung.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.574
Yeah, uh, yeah, actually,
I think, I think it's...

36:25.618 --> 36:27.315
I think it's worse than that.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.230
From what I'm hearing,
it sounds like

36:29.274 --> 36:30.884
you may have
lacerated your aorta.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.886
What's that mean?
What's that mean?

36:32.929 --> 36:35.802
It means that your lungs

36:35.845 --> 36:38.892
are gonna start filling up with
blood, and you're gonna drown.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.981
You can fix me.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.374
I'm gonna be right back.Fix me.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.636
I'll be right back.Come back.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.428
Okay. I got to make
a bore needle.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.301
No? No. No, uh, needle.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.128
Maybe I can, uh,

36:58.172 --> 37:00.348
use my knife to open your chest.: No.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.916
No. I'm not gonna do that.Ow!

37:02.959 --> 37:05.745
Idiot! There's nothing here!
Damn it!

37:05.788 --> 37:07.007
Mac, please.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.445
I know...
I know what you can use.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.794
What?

37:11.838 --> 37:14.580
You can use that.
You can use that.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.062
Please.

37:23.066 --> 37:24.807
Absolutely not.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.069
One lives, one dies.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.810
Come on.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.159
Mac, I-I'm dying.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.253
You can't expect me to do that.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.255
Bet you could.
Come on, man.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.734
:
Do this for me, please.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.910
Please.

37:55.490 --> 37:58.450
♪

38:18.905 --> 38:21.342
♪

38:30.960 --> 38:32.919
I'm so sorry.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.315
Do it!

38:46.715 --> 38:49.501
♪

38:50.676 --> 38:54.375
You got what you wanted!
Now open the door!

38:54.419 --> 38:56.421
One dies!

39:00.512 --> 39:02.601
I'm unarmed
and I can barely stand,

39:02.644 --> 39:05.125
and you can't even face me?

39:05.168 --> 39:07.301
Guy I knew years ago
wasn't such a coward.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.652
Now open the door, Griggs.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.195
You're not completely unarmed.

39:33.327 --> 39:34.415
What about that knife of yours?

39:37.505 --> 39:38.506
Mm.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.554
How'd you know it was me?

39:42.597 --> 39:45.078
Only you would've left me
with a knife.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.646
Why all this?

39:47.689 --> 39:49.082
You and Dalton,

39:49.125 --> 39:50.866
you abandoned me and
Hadley in Jakarta.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.128
You ran away.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.521
What are you talking about?

39:53.565 --> 39:54.783
We were told that you were
killed in the explosion.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.176
I'm sure that's what
you told yourself

39:56.219 --> 39:57.743
so you could sleep at night.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.397
Dying...

39:59.440 --> 40:02.225
that would have been easier.

40:02.269 --> 40:05.054
The blast only wounded us.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.795
Samrozi's men grabbed us.

40:06.839 --> 40:09.972
The bastard nursed
us back to health

40:10.016 --> 40:11.496
just so he could torture us

40:11.539 --> 40:14.412
for intel on the Agency.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.501
We were locked in
a concrete box,

40:16.544 --> 40:19.242
kept awake for days,

40:19.286 --> 40:21.723
starved, beaten.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.421
You and Dalton
only got a taste,

40:23.464 --> 40:26.119
but for me...

40:26.162 --> 40:28.861
it lasted years.

40:28.904 --> 40:31.298
And only
after I gave up hope

40:31.341 --> 40:33.343
did Samrozi
offer a way out.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.476
One lives, one dies.Mm-hmm.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.392
I thought I could be
strong, but I broke.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.134
And I shot Hadley.

40:41.177 --> 40:44.180
I killed my best friend
so that I could live.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.227
And now, so have you.

40:49.185 --> 40:51.057
So now you understand.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.451
What now?

40:54.495 --> 40:56.366
You die.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.027
Dalton.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.072
Griggsy.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.600
MacGYVER: Okay, I know
what you're thinking.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.472
How did we pull this off?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.648
Zip guns have been around
for decades.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.432
Compress a bed spring
and a pipe.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.436
You set a pin,
and then add a projectile,

41:22.480 --> 41:25.004
like the lead slug
from a bullet,

41:25.047 --> 41:27.223
which, once you've removed it
from the shell,

41:27.267 --> 41:29.443
leaves you with a blank
for a pistol.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.489
But making a squib?
Honestly, asking Jack

41:31.532 --> 41:33.578
to bleed into a bag
was the hardest part.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.231
The takeaway?

41:35.275 --> 41:36.406
It's amazing
how creative you can be

41:36.450 --> 41:37.712
when facing certain death.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.801
Next time, we're faking
your death, pal,

41:39.845 --> 41:41.411
'cause getting killed hurts.

41:41.455 --> 41:42.717
It hurts a lot.

41:42.761 --> 41:44.371
Amen.

41:44.414 --> 41:45.503
I would, but I don't know

41:45.546 --> 41:47.026
if I could do any better
than you did.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.288
Well, thank you.

41:48.331 --> 41:49.550
But I could probably use
some acting lessons.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.291
You know, playing
dead's not nearly

41:51.334 --> 41:52.814
as easy as it sounds.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.599
Griggs is still alive.

41:54.642 --> 41:56.078
There you go.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.297
You know, we only got a sample
of what he went through.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.908
That still don't make it right.

41:59.952 --> 42:02.868
Hmm. What-what do you
want to do with him?

42:02.911 --> 42:06.262
We could leave him down here
in this hole to rot.

42:06.306 --> 42:08.787
Kidding.

42:08.830 --> 42:09.875
Kind of.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.837
You know, what happened
to him and Hadley

42:15.881 --> 42:16.969
could've happened to us.

42:17.012 --> 42:18.927
Any op can go bad.

42:18.971 --> 42:21.713
Don't I know it.

42:24.759 --> 42:26.761
See this is exactly
why our yearly trips

42:26.805 --> 42:28.589
to Las Vegas
are so important.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.069
I mean, in this
line of work,

42:30.112 --> 42:31.853
you got to celebrate
while you can.

42:38.033 --> 42:39.469

42:39.513 --> 42:42.298
