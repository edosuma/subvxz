00:03.581 --> 00:07.407
Ok, only on the table, and
no decorating the store items.

00:07.407 --> 00:08.781
Mommy sees any glitter on the wall,

00:08.785 --> 00:11.300
- She's gonna be very bummed. 
- I know, mom.

00:12.274 --> 00:14.193
Thank you for hanging
out while I do inventory.

00:14.227 --> 00:16.693
Now remember, if anybody
comes to the door...

00:16.727 --> 00:19.083
Don't answer it, just
scream really loud.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.366
Ok, you don't have to scare them.

00:20.366 --> 00:21.974
Just let me know that somebody's here.

00:21.974 --> 00:25.353
Ok? I'm going to be downstairs
for just a few minutes.

00:27.488 --> 00:29.345
Aiden. Glitter.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:38.758 --> 00:40.103
Aiden?

00:51.447 --> 00:53.093
Aiden?

00:53.438 --> 00:55.266
Is that you?

00:56.472 --> 00:58.153
Aiden?

01:09.999 --> 01:11.199
Ok.

01:11.199 --> 01:12.213
Aiden!

01:12.641 --> 01:13.726
Mom?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.478
You scared me.

01:17.931 --> 01:19.781
You were calling me.

01:20.082 --> 01:21.796
Well, how long have you been down here?

01:21.796 --> 01:24.826
Just now. Is something wrong?

01:24.860 --> 01:26.094
No. No, nothing.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.366
I just...I thought somebody was here.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.104
Someone was here.

01:31.534 --> 01:33.206
Who was here?

01:33.206 --> 01:34.028
Someone.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.472
But I didn't scream, because
they weren't at the door.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.743
Ok, where were they?

01:37.743 --> 01:40.784
I don't know. I guess they're gone now.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.757
All right. Come on. Let's go upstairs.

01:51.135 --> 01:52.812
Balloon. Is this yours?

01:54.284 --> 01:56.089
Can we go now?

01:56.446 --> 01:57.078
Yeah.

01:57.078 --> 02:00.217
I mean, home. Can we go home?

02:00.596 --> 02:01.678
Yes.

02:01.678 --> 02:03.719
We can go home. Come on.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.949
Not again with the covers.

02:09.949 --> 02:11.190
He's always kicking them off.

02:11.190 --> 02:13.068
So he can climb into
our bed and get warm.

02:13.103 --> 02:14.303
You're ruining his alibi.

02:14.338 --> 02:16.140
Hey, when are you coming home?

02:16.174 --> 02:18.204
When my shift is over. Promise.

02:18.204 --> 02:20.812
You said it was quiet.
Can't you get out early?

02:20.812 --> 02:21.998
What's going on?

02:21.998 --> 02:24.320
Oh, I just wish you were here.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.881
Miss you, and...

02:26.571 --> 02:27.754
What else?

02:29.391 --> 02:31.726
I just get this strange feeling

02:31.761 --> 02:34.865
that somebody's... watching me.

02:34.899 --> 02:36.766
You mean like a dead someone?

02:36.766 --> 02:37.677
Yeah.

02:37.677 --> 02:39.496
And Aiden, he's felt it, too.

02:39.496 --> 02:41.146
It's just...

02:43.603 --> 02:46.113
The house just feels
kinda creepy tonight.

02:46.113 --> 02:49.018
That's strange. Nothing creeps you out.

02:55.237 --> 02:57.150
That's not entirely true.

02:57.150 --> 03:00.000
Mel. Mel.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.946
- Clowns do. 
- Are you ok?

03:06.980 --> 03:08.681
I'll call you back.

03:10.017 --> 03:11.885
Who are you?

03:14.456 --> 03:17.926
You don't remember.

03:17.961 --> 03:20.330
Do you know how you got here?

04:30.100 --> 04:32.100
- Aiden get to school ok? 
- Yeah.

04:32.134 --> 04:34.035
He just felt so bad for missing the bus.

04:34.069 --> 04:35.840
I told him I'm the one who overslept.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.069
More clown nightmares?

04:37.069 --> 04:38.315
I wish they were nightmares.

04:38.315 --> 04:40.443
- It was real. 
- A real ghost?

04:40.443 --> 04:42.428
Yeah, I guess a real clown.

04:42.428 --> 04:44.737
Well, while you were
gone, I got on the web,

04:44.737 --> 04:46.597
And, um, as far as I can see,

04:46.597 --> 04:47.945
There's nothing about a dead clown.

04:47.979 --> 04:49.680
I mean, not in the
vicinity and not recently.

04:49.714 --> 04:50.612
Well, how not recent?

04:50.612 --> 04:52.161
I mean, maybe he died a while ago.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.237
As far as I can tell,

04:53.237 --> 04:56.124
There has never once been a clown
who has dropped dead in Grandview.

04:56.124 --> 04:57.961
Well, this town has that going for it.

04:57.961 --> 05:00.154
Hey, maybe your ghost was just
passing through, like the circus.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.621
So the circus in town?

05:01.621 --> 05:02.634
'cause he might be attached...

05:02.634 --> 05:05.059
No circus, sorry. Hey.

05:05.093 --> 05:06.460
Given your feeling about clowns,

05:06.495 --> 05:07.629
maybe you should just let this one go.

05:07.663 --> 05:09.765
Not a chance, given my
feelings about clowns.

05:09.799 --> 05:12.161
And he came into our home.

05:12.161 --> 05:14.937
With his creepy face
paint and orange hair.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.387
Maybe he's just attached to something
I brought home from the store.

05:18.387 --> 05:19.422
Well, good luck finding that,

05:19.422 --> 05:21.190
'cause the house is filled
with stuff from your store.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.386
Speaking of which, I just
had Aiden's tired patched.

05:23.386 --> 05:25.580
Well, I'm here if you
need an extra set of hands.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.071
No.

05:30.071 --> 05:31.586
I did not just do that.

05:32.894 --> 05:35.328
- Where did that come from? 
- Where do you think?

05:41.034 --> 05:44.158
This is why you stayed
on earth, seriously?

05:44.158 --> 05:46.349
I don't know why I did that.

05:46.349 --> 05:48.124
I don't understand any of this.

05:48.124 --> 05:49.674
"this," meaning your death?

05:49.708 --> 05:50.942
This.

05:51.460 --> 05:52.910
This isn't me.

05:52.944 --> 05:54.211
You're not a clown?

05:54.501 --> 05:57.874
You don't remember ever being a clown?

05:59.077 --> 06:00.573
No.

06:00.573 --> 06:02.241
Ok, well, do you remember anything,

06:02.241 --> 06:06.059
Like your name or how you died?

06:06.571 --> 06:09.307
Someone make you feel like a fool?

06:12.495 --> 06:13.561
Sorry.

06:13.561 --> 06:16.270
I'm sorry. I...I didn't mean to do that.

06:17.420 --> 06:20.099
Did that ghost just make water?

06:20.283 --> 06:21.557
Yeah.

06:21.557 --> 06:24.067
The old flower gag.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.998
So not a metaphorical clown?

06:27.998 --> 06:29.387
But don't you say ghosts sometimes

06:29.387 --> 06:31.458
appears the way they
felt when they died?

06:31.458 --> 06:32.643
Oh, I wish.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.794
It's your coulrophobia.

06:34.794 --> 06:37.236
Your fear of clowns. A lot
of people have that phobia.

06:37.236 --> 06:39.774
You know, it's creepy
make-up, the weird costumes.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.580
It makes you think
they're hiding something.

06:42.450 --> 06:45.023
Or lurking. There he is.

06:45.023 --> 06:47.387
He's hanging around some woman.

06:48.522 --> 06:51.415
Why do I always look where you
look when I know I can't see ghosts?

06:51.415 --> 06:52.858
I fall for it, too, every time.

06:52.892 --> 06:54.232
It's like the old fake flower gag.

06:54.232 --> 06:55.963
He's just staring at her,
this woman with red hair.

06:55.963 --> 06:57.726
Maybe she knows who he is.

06:57.726 --> 06:58.945
Sorry. Wait one second.

06:58.945 --> 07:00.899
You just need to go
forward! She's leaving!

07:00.933 --> 07:02.052
Your leg is right in there, it's jammed.

07:02.134 --> 07:03.434
Eli, she's going to leave! Just move!

07:03.469 --> 07:05.498
Eli, why do you always
sit on the outside?

07:05.498 --> 07:07.181
Because of this, exactly this.

07:07.181 --> 07:09.041
I'm scared of being trapped.

07:12.884 --> 07:13.804
Oh, god!

07:13.804 --> 07:14.947
She's gone now.

07:14.947 --> 07:16.600
I mean, how am I supposed
to cross over a ghost

07:16.600 --> 07:18.523
who has no idea who he was?

07:18.523 --> 07:20.017
Well, you do it all the time.

07:20.017 --> 07:22.189
Except most ghosts don't
even want to remember.

07:22.189 --> 07:24.084
'cause they've done something horrible.

07:24.118 --> 07:26.214
Maybe that's why he's hiding
behind the grease paint.

07:26.777 --> 07:29.231
I am never going to sleep tonight.

07:29.737 --> 07:31.999
So you're sure the redhead
was someone he knew?

07:31.999 --> 07:33.523
Well, he was totally fixated on her.

07:33.523 --> 07:34.881
I thought at least she'd be a start.

07:34.881 --> 07:36.603
He didn't seem to
remember anything else.

07:36.603 --> 07:37.691
Why do they come to you?

07:37.691 --> 07:40.156
I mean, what does he want?

07:40.156 --> 07:41.259
Maybe he's lost.

07:41.259 --> 07:43.447
Yeah, and somehow he found you.

07:43.447 --> 07:46.374
All right, so the thing
that he's attached to,

07:46.374 --> 07:47.846
it's something from the store, right?

07:47.846 --> 07:50.841
It's gotta be. I mean, he didn't
even seem to know how he got here.

07:50.841 --> 07:52.840
If I could just figure out what it was.

07:52.874 --> 07:55.690
Right. Well, I got about a half an
hour of patient's notes to finish,

07:55.690 --> 07:57.577
Then I can help you go
through all this stuff.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.978
Oh, that would be great. I
have more boxes downstairs.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.914
All right.

08:13.624 --> 08:16.442
Jim, can you check the fuse?

08:23.230 --> 08:25.357
Who are you?

08:26.571 --> 08:28.600
What do you want?

08:30.603 --> 08:33.203
Why...why are you staring at me?

08:34.067 --> 08:35.840
Please just...

08:35.874 --> 08:38.643
Please get me out of here, please!

08:38.677 --> 08:41.215
What do you want from
me, stop staring at me!

08:41.215 --> 08:42.746
Say something!

08:42.780 --> 08:43.980
Just...

08:44.015 --> 08:46.682
Get me out of here, stop looking at me.

08:46.717 --> 08:47.850
Who are you? Please!

08:47.884 --> 08:49.852
Please just stop staring at me!

08:51.154 --> 08:52.654
A 15 minute counseling session occurred

08:52.688 --> 08:54.756
when I explained the
mild drop in hemoglobin

08:54.790 --> 08:58.125
was entirely consistent with
an iron deficiency anemia...

08:58.915 --> 09:00.577
Did you hear me?

09:00.917 --> 09:02.189
Hear what?

09:02.189 --> 09:03.873
I was screaming.

09:05.733 --> 09:06.800
Or at least I thought I was.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.909
Maybe I was just having a vision.

09:07.909 --> 09:10.328
Hey, I'm sorry. What kind of vision?

09:10.328 --> 09:12.124
People were staring at me.

09:12.124 --> 09:13.988
The usual ghosts?

09:14.430 --> 09:16.101
Strangers.

09:16.532 --> 09:18.949
It was like I was in a
fishbowl or something.

09:19.209 --> 09:22.545
Hey, you know what, maybe
your ghost was a clown

09:22.579 --> 09:24.846
who just didn't like his audience, huh?

09:25.848 --> 09:27.616
What?

09:28.738 --> 09:30.119
I gave this to you.

09:30.119 --> 09:32.089
Yeah, to record my patient notes.

09:32.089 --> 09:33.180
You gave it to me...

09:33.180 --> 09:34.524
Yesterday.

09:35.498 --> 09:37.481
Yeah, the box that I
brought in from the landlord,

09:37.481 --> 09:40.977
She said that her tenant
had left things behind.

09:40.977 --> 09:43.064
What if he left it
behind because he died?

09:43.064 --> 09:44.580
I thought we were
talking about your vision.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.069
I'm just trying to figure out any reason

09:46.069 --> 09:47.671
why this ghost would be in our home,

09:47.671 --> 09:49.644
And this is the only
new thing from the store.

09:49.644 --> 09:51.615
Why would a ghost use a tape recorder?

09:51.615 --> 09:53.636
I mean, don't they usually
just sort of mime things?

09:53.671 --> 09:54.804
Look.

09:54.838 --> 09:56.633
The mild drop in hemoglobin

09:56.633 --> 09:59.920
was entirely consistent with
an iron deficiency anemia...

10:00.519 --> 10:02.065
Did you use both sides?

10:06.781 --> 10:08.581
Seated in the booth

10:08.616 --> 10:11.551
near the window. That's pretty carefree.

10:11.585 --> 10:12.785
Waitress gives 2 menus.

10:12.819 --> 10:15.119
But wait, now she's taking one.

10:15.154 --> 10:17.489
Who's that?

10:18.420 --> 10:21.026
Leaving work at lunch,
third time this week.

10:21.094 --> 10:23.560
Both less than an hour.

10:24.339 --> 10:25.530
That's him.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.993
That's the clown's
voice, I'm sure of it.

10:28.815 --> 10:32.435
Subject checking his cell
phone. Come on, make a move.

10:32.435 --> 10:35.062
Leaving work at lunch,
third time this week.

10:35.062 --> 10:37.016
Subject, what was he, a cop?

10:37.396 --> 10:38.769
Play it one more time.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.178
Waitress gives 2 menus,

10:40.178 --> 10:42.324
But wait, now she's taking one.

10:42.324 --> 10:44.551
Damn, more wasted hours.

10:44.551 --> 10:46.778
Client's gonna be
pissed, and I'm starving.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.157
Oh, wait, 12:42. Lunch date has arrived.

10:50.157 --> 10:53.074
Little kiss hello.
That's innocent enough.

10:53.074 --> 10:54.124
Talking.

10:54.124 --> 10:55.818
More talking.

10:55.818 --> 10:56.776
Ah, come on.

10:56.776 --> 10:58.333
Somebody bust a move here.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.301
Client.

11:01.335 --> 11:02.869
He said client.

11:02.904 --> 11:04.818
Yeah, if that belonged to your clown...

11:05.079 --> 11:06.041
No.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.141
He wasn't a clown.

11:09.188 --> 11:11.811
He was a private detective.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.737
Yep, here he is, Charles
Hammond Investigations.

11:23.771 --> 11:25.755
A ghost P.I.

11:25.755 --> 11:27.758
Do you think that explains
your feelings of being watched?

11:27.758 --> 11:29.922
I'm not sure why I needed
the whole crowd staring at me,

11:29.922 --> 11:31.318
But I guess so.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.637
You sure the clown
get-up was a disguise

11:32.638 --> 11:33.805
and not some kind of fetish?

11:34.100 --> 11:37.353
I mean, maybe he's just mortified
they found him in his private wear

11:37.353 --> 11:38.439
and that's why he's been hanging around.

11:38.439 --> 11:40.170
He died last week at a birthday party.

11:40.205 --> 11:41.572
Ok, this just gets creepier.

11:41.606 --> 11:43.040
He was hanging around kids

11:43.075 --> 11:45.780
as a fake clown at a party?

11:45.780 --> 11:47.462
The party was
for a 15-year-old.

11:47.462 --> 11:49.380
What 15-year-old wants
a clown at her party?

11:49.414 --> 11:50.624
Brittany Cabot, apparently.

11:50.624 --> 11:51.472
How do you know all this?

11:51.472 --> 11:52.916
I thought there were no
dead clowns in Grandview.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.335
There was one in the emergency room.

11:54.335 --> 11:55.430
Jim asked around.

11:55.430 --> 11:57.964
Charles Hammond was dead on arrival,

11:57.964 --> 12:01.222
And he choked on a balloon at the party.

12:01.256 --> 12:02.689
Rookie mistake.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.767
That's why they have
clown school, you know?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.819
Anyway, Brittany's father, Alex,

12:06.819 --> 12:08.777
He didn't want any weird publicity.

12:09.259 --> 12:10.431
I guess he has an in with the paper.

12:10.431 --> 12:12.009
He owns all these electronics stores.

12:12.009 --> 12:14.115
So that's why they didn't mention
that the guy was dressed as a clown.

12:14.115 --> 12:17.001
Yeah, or the fact that there was
a P.I. snooping around his house.

12:17.035 --> 12:19.670
Is that who he was investigating,
the electronics king?

12:19.704 --> 12:21.860
For all we know, he could have
been working for Alex Cabot.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.808
What about the tapes, the
surveillance notes that Charlie took?

12:24.842 --> 12:26.509
Is there anything about
the party or Cabot?

12:26.543 --> 12:29.607
Tape. They only found one in all
these boxes from Charlie's office.

12:29.607 --> 12:30.665
And?

12:30.889 --> 12:33.050
Well, he likes to use people's initials.

12:33.288 --> 12:35.418
He was talking about some guy, A.C.

12:35.418 --> 12:36.690
That's Alex Cabot.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.646
Yeah, but it was like he was
working on more than one case,

12:38.646 --> 12:40.934
'cause there was this
woman's initials, S.P.,

12:40.934 --> 12:43.321
But I couldn't tell whether he was
following her or working for her.

12:43.321 --> 12:44.517
Now what?

12:44.517 --> 12:45.741
We have to talk to the king.

12:45.741 --> 12:47.065
Find out what he knows about our P.I.,

12:47.065 --> 12:48.970
and if he knows anything
about the woman in the square.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.055
The redhead.

12:50.055 --> 12:51.859
Please don't.

12:52.809 --> 12:54.843
Charles.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.095
That's your name, isn't it?

12:57.095 --> 12:59.478
Look, you don't have to
run away from who you are.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.071
Whatever you did, whatever you need,

13:02.815 --> 13:04.366
We can help you.

13:04.656 --> 13:06.355
I still don't understand.

13:06.355 --> 13:08.433
That's probably because
you died so suddenly.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.943
And whatever you were doing,
you wanted to forget about it.

13:10.943 --> 13:12.401
We can help you work through it;

13:12.401 --> 13:13.903
Help you find peace.

13:14.205 --> 13:15.681
I hardly remember anything.

13:15.716 --> 13:17.648
I...

13:21.753 --> 13:23.960
Maybe there's a good reason for that.

13:24.908 --> 13:26.292
Charles?

13:26.292 --> 13:28.789
I think people called me Charlie.

13:29.839 --> 13:31.836
Wow, so this is you.

13:32.821 --> 13:34.557
Do you feel better now?

13:34.557 --> 13:37.129
You were a private
investigator, not a clown.

13:37.368 --> 13:38.842
Yeah.

13:38.842 --> 13:40.649
Yeah, that makes sense.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.995
So what were you doing at the Cabot's?

13:44.871 --> 13:46.229
I don't know.

13:46.229 --> 13:48.612
Who's the redhead you were watching?

13:50.709 --> 13:53.063
I...I know secrets,

13:53.063 --> 13:54.799
other people's secrets.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.283
That's why they pay me.

13:56.283 --> 13:58.701
Ok, so is that what's keeping you here?

13:59.605 --> 14:01.687
Maybe their secrets should die with me.

14:02.086 --> 14:03.987
Hello? Is anybody here?

14:04.562 --> 14:06.544
Yeah, just a second.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.746
It's you!

14:16.746 --> 14:18.925
- Excuse me? 
- Oh, my god.

14:19.475 --> 14:21.377
We...we have a customer!

14:21.377 --> 14:23.701
- That's great! 
- Awesome!

14:23.701 --> 14:25.449
- Fantastic! 
- Great.

14:25.449 --> 14:29.190
Well, good! It's...good to be here.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.387
Are you Melinda?

14:30.387 --> 14:32.369
Yeah. Yes. And you are?

14:32.369 --> 14:33.508
Sherry.

14:33.508 --> 14:35.540
I'm...I'm looking for some things

14:35.540 --> 14:38.199
that belonged to a friend of
mine, named Charlie Hammond.

14:38.199 --> 14:39.959
Of course you are.

14:39.959 --> 14:41.561
I think.

14:41.561 --> 14:44.246
So what is that you're
specifically looking for?

14:44.246 --> 14:46.087
Uh, everything his landlord gave you.

14:47.075 --> 14:49.566
I guess you were a
really good friend of his.

14:50.593 --> 14:51.855
He was a really good guy.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.957
How did you know Charlie, exactly?

14:54.451 --> 14:55.913
I'm sorry.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.171
Why does that matter, exactly?

14:58.700 --> 15:00.829
Well, it's just that
everything that came in

15:00.863 --> 15:03.131
from his landlord was from his work.

15:03.165 --> 15:06.965
And his parents have already gone
through his personal effects, so...

15:07.836 --> 15:09.437
Maybe they missed something.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.323
I'm sure that they were pretty upset.

15:11.323 --> 15:13.506
Do you know what
Charlie did for a living?

15:13.540 --> 15:15.741
He was a private detective.

15:16.506 --> 15:18.243
So that's how you got to know
Charlie, through his work?

15:19.436 --> 15:20.438
Uh, no.

15:20.438 --> 15:23.101
We both did Tai Chi in
the park every morning.

15:23.101 --> 15:25.701
Boy, you guys ask a lot of questions.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.685
I'm sorry. I was just
wondering. You know, 'cause,

15:29.305 --> 15:33.893
His work belongings, you
know, they might be private.

15:34.389 --> 15:39.294
Well, then, you wouldn't want to
sell it to just anyone, would you?

15:40.497 --> 15:43.841
Look, I'm... I'm looking for
anything of sentimental value;

15:43.841 --> 15:45.065
Things that his family overlooked.

15:45.065 --> 15:48.042
I'll pay you double whatever
you paid for the stuff.

15:48.042 --> 15:50.129
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
have to catalog it first,

15:50.129 --> 15:52.838
but if you want to leave
a number, I can call you.

15:52.873 --> 15:54.640
And, Sherry, could you
just put your last name,

15:54.674 --> 15:56.541
Please, for my records.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.910
Parks. Sherry Parks.

16:02.232 --> 16:03.892
Are you from here originally?

16:03.892 --> 16:04.762
Nope.

16:04.762 --> 16:05.893
Thanks.

16:05.893 --> 16:07.810
Sherry, just one more question,

16:07.810 --> 16:09.652
Since you were really
good friends with Charlie.

16:09.687 --> 16:13.447
Did he ever talk to you
about a guy named Alex Cabot?

16:14.857 --> 16:18.426
Alex Cabot, that's my boyfriend.

16:19.081 --> 16:20.480
Why do you ask?

16:21.079 --> 16:23.507
We've just... we've seen you with him.

16:23.507 --> 16:25.732
You know, small town.

16:26.547 --> 16:27.667
Guess so.

16:33.103 --> 16:34.571
We just met S.P.

16:34.571 --> 16:35.899
- Sherry Parks. 
- Yeah!

16:35.899 --> 16:38.008
The girl that Charlie
mentioned on the tape.

16:38.042 --> 16:40.610
Is that why she came here,
for surveillance notes?

16:41.007 --> 16:43.472
Wait, you're thinking Charlie
was tailing the redhead.

16:43.472 --> 16:45.747
or up to something with
A.C., her boyfriend.

16:45.781 --> 16:48.621
You mean someone else hired
Charlie to keep an eye on them,

16:48.621 --> 16:51.125
At the Cabot's house,
dressed as a clown.

16:51.455 --> 16:53.698
Maybe it was the only disguise
he could get on such short notice.

16:53.698 --> 16:55.356
Nope. He had plenty.

16:55.356 --> 16:56.801
You're an 11, right?

16:57.070 --> 16:57.859
What are you doing?

16:57.859 --> 17:00.960
I am helping you find out what
happened to the clown at the party.

17:00.994 --> 17:02.561
Ding dong.

17:09.421 --> 17:11.676
I have a delivery for a Sherry Parks.

17:11.676 --> 17:13.133
Here?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.499
You gotta be kidding me.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.115
Sorry. Wrong address?

17:16.115 --> 17:18.396
No. I mean, yes, but no.

17:18.396 --> 17:20.079
She doesn't live here. Yet.

17:20.488 --> 17:21.646
Do you have a king suite?

17:21.682 --> 17:22.647
Dad.

17:22.683 --> 17:24.240
Do you have an ultra king suite?

17:24.240 --> 17:26.499
Are there any room descriptions with
the word "ultra" in front of them,

17:26.499 --> 17:28.169
'cause I'm bringing somebody
special, I want the best.

17:28.169 --> 17:29.083
Dad!

17:29.841 --> 17:31.712
It's a delivery. Handle it.

17:32.024 --> 17:36.003
Let me guess, something
else fit for a queen.

17:36.003 --> 17:37.027
Where do I sign?

17:40.522 --> 17:41.759
You know, the last time I was here,

17:41.759 --> 17:43.447
there was a big party going on.

17:43.447 --> 17:44.651
I think it was your birthday.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.623
A clown even came to the door. Nice guy.

17:48.623 --> 17:49.851
I never really met him.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.869
He was sort of a sad
clown, 'cause he died.

17:52.869 --> 17:55.894
What?! That's awful,
but I gotta ask you.

17:55.894 --> 17:58.630
You know, I mean, you seem a little
old to have a clown at your party.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.841
Who hired him? Was it your dad?

18:00.841 --> 18:04.230
I wanted the clown. It
was supposed to be ironic.

18:04.698 --> 18:05.671
I don't get that.

18:05.671 --> 18:07.623
So you want to give me the package?

18:07.623 --> 18:09.214
You said Ms. Parks doesn't live here.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.771
She's my dad's girlfriend.

18:10.771 --> 18:12.357
You don't seem too happy about that.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.388
Can you tell me what's
in there? In the box?

18:17.388 --> 18:19.258
It's insured, it's from New York City.

18:19.258 --> 18:21.869
It's probably from some
fancy jewelry store.

18:21.869 --> 18:22.875
I think it is.

18:23.042 --> 18:25.637
Ooh, Ingleman's. Yeah.
Hmm. It's a good one.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.155
Here we go again. Idiot.

18:28.155 --> 18:29.879
He's an idiot for buying
his girlfriend jewelry?

18:29.879 --> 18:32.434
Expensive jewelry she's
just going to trade in,

18:32.434 --> 18:34.560
take the cash and replace with fakes.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.276
Well, that's a pretty
specific assumption.

18:36.276 --> 18:38.133
He got her these diamond stud earrings.

18:38.133 --> 18:40.150
She swapped them with cubic zirconia.

18:40.150 --> 18:41.419
That's low!

18:41.419 --> 18:43.210
- Did you tell your dad this? 
- Yep.

18:43.210 --> 18:44.139
Did he believe you?

18:44.139 --> 18:46.266
He's still ordering her expensive crap,

18:46.323 --> 18:48.193
So what do you think?

18:48.193 --> 18:52.244
He's, like, blinded by
love or lust or whatever.

18:52.244 --> 18:54.066
I've never seen him work
this hard for a girl,

18:54.066 --> 18:55.902
And believe me, there's been plenty.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.397
Brittany, what are you doing
out there? Did you sign?

18:58.579 --> 19:01.460
Give it to me. If I don't have the
receipt, I won't have any proof.

19:04.771 --> 19:08.628
Oh, I love angry
teenagers. Total Paydirt.

19:08.628 --> 19:09.921
I don't know what they're
going to think about

19:09.921 --> 19:11.314
that chinese vase I packed, but...

19:12.306 --> 19:14.940
Not the blue one, from my store.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.197
I had to bring something.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.819
Why, was it expensive?

19:18.345 --> 19:20.141
Go on. I'm breathing deeply.

19:20.141 --> 19:21.250
At least you got your foot in the door.

19:21.284 --> 19:23.614
Ok, I still don't
know who hired Charlie,

19:23.614 --> 19:26.521
But I think I know who he's
investigating... Sherry Parks.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.303
The daughter thinks
she's a total scammer,

19:28.303 --> 19:29.614
Just after her dad's money.

19:29.614 --> 19:31.542
Does anyone else think
this? Does the father?

19:31.542 --> 19:32.593
It's possible.

19:32.593 --> 19:34.684
She told her dad about her suspicions.

19:34.684 --> 19:36.451
Ok, so maybe he hired Charlie.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.031
I wouldn't rule out the daughter.

19:38.031 --> 19:39.334
She's 15.

19:39.334 --> 19:41.125
- You haven't met her. 
- Ok.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.501
Look, whoever Charlie was working for,

19:42.535 --> 19:44.217
why is he still hanging around?

19:44.217 --> 19:45.403
What is he trying to find out?

19:45.437 --> 19:47.491
Or hide?

20:10.105 --> 20:12.606
Keep your nose out of my business.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.863
You're a clown again.

20:18.863 --> 20:20.216
I need you to hear me.

20:20.216 --> 20:22.367
By threatening me? Why?

20:22.367 --> 20:24.331
Is this about that woman?

20:24.331 --> 20:25.661
Sherry? 'cause...

20:27.328 --> 20:28.382
I can help you.

20:28.382 --> 20:31.502
Help me? No, you're the
one that ruined everything.

20:31.502 --> 20:34.137
She's gonna run again, and
then it's going to be too late.

20:34.137 --> 20:36.074
Too late for what?

20:50.558 --> 20:52.155
You're saying he warned
you to keep your nose

20:52.155 --> 20:54.245
out of his business
by removing your nose?

20:54.245 --> 20:56.140
That's a little
literal, don't you think?

20:56.140 --> 20:57.403
I guess. Why?

20:57.403 --> 20:59.510
His other warning was
so cryptic, you know?

20:59.510 --> 21:00.735
The whole fishbowl thing.

21:00.735 --> 21:02.314
I don't know, I got something out of it.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.031
Your nose?

21:04.031 --> 21:06.648
Look, the best clue was when he said
that Sherry was going to run again,

21:06.648 --> 21:08.154
Meaning she's run before.

21:08.154 --> 21:10.355
- I wonder what from. 
- Or from who?

21:10.389 --> 21:13.118
So these are all these case files?

21:13.118 --> 21:16.641
Files would mean an
attempt at organization.

21:16.641 --> 21:17.894
Yeah.

21:18.435 --> 21:20.409
I'm thinking that he does
a lot of divorce work.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.103
Yeah, except Sherry's not married,

21:22.103 --> 21:24.202
And her boyfriend's
been divorced for years.

21:24.202 --> 21:25.502
Maybe she was married before.

21:25.502 --> 21:26.797
You know, I looked her up.

21:26.797 --> 21:29.305
Do you have any idea how
common the name Sherry Parks is?

21:29.305 --> 21:31.800
And I'm guessing not a lot of
those files had photos in them?

21:31.800 --> 21:32.891
You got it.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.800
Alex's daughter told Eli
that she was a gold digger;

21:35.800 --> 21:38.245
That she sold the diamonds right
out of the earrings he gave her.

21:38.311 --> 21:39.733
Maybe there was a guy
before Alex, you know,

21:39.733 --> 21:41.248
Someone she ripped off before.

21:41.282 --> 21:42.725
And who's still out
there looking for her.

21:43.884 --> 21:45.958
I believe that these are Aiden's,

21:45.958 --> 21:49.486
or else your P.I. has infiltrated
a stolen homework ring.

21:49.521 --> 21:52.062
You know, can you explain to me
how he takes 6 apples out of 20

21:52.062 --> 21:54.356
and gets an 8 million number?

21:55.825 --> 21:58.224
Wow, he really does love
that number, doesn't he?

21:58.224 --> 22:00.277
Yeah. You know, it's
like father, like son.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.298
I was like this with your number.

22:02.330 --> 22:03.571
I wrote it down everywhere.

22:03.571 --> 22:04.877
I was really worried
that I would forget it.

22:04.877 --> 22:06.696
I put it on milk cartons, banana peels,

22:06.696 --> 22:07.798
my buddy's dashboard.

22:07.798 --> 22:09.170
That's sweet.

22:09.971 --> 22:11.740
Phone number.

22:11.740 --> 22:12.784
What?

22:13.292 --> 22:14.691
Todd Lieber.

22:14.691 --> 22:15.614
Who's Todd Lieber?

22:15.614 --> 22:17.863
Maybe a client of
Charlie's, but look at this.

22:17.863 --> 22:20.345
He's in Weston, that's
only a couple towns away.

22:20.379 --> 22:21.725
What, Sherry was from Weston?

22:21.725 --> 22:23.637
I don't know, but look,
this was dated 10 days ago.

22:23.637 --> 22:25.361
That's the most recent
thing in these files.

22:25.361 --> 22:27.818
This must have been the case
he was working on when he died.

22:28.953 --> 22:32.197
Wait a minute, you think maybe Sherry
pulled her gold digger act on Todd,

22:32.197 --> 22:34.255
took all his money, and
then Todd hired Charlie

22:34.290 --> 22:35.223
to go and look for her.

22:35.256 --> 22:36.423
Well, if Todd is willing to talk to me,

22:36.457 --> 22:37.657
I'm going to find out. Aiden!

22:37.692 --> 22:40.107
Let's go, school!

22:40.107 --> 22:42.108
Ok. Here.

22:42.108 --> 22:43.225
I got it, mom.

22:43.225 --> 22:44.702
Are you sure, you don't want any help?

22:44.702 --> 22:46.763
- I'm fine. 
- Great.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.681
Aiden...

22:52.929 --> 22:55.431
What did you put in this backpack?

22:55.735 --> 22:59.043
Did you pack rocks again for share day?

23:00.102 --> 23:01.417
What's the matter?

23:01.417 --> 23:03.779
Someone's inside the car.

23:03.888 --> 23:04.940
Where?

23:05.346 --> 23:09.550
I don't... I don't see
anyone. Is it a ghost in there?

23:09.871 --> 23:11.718
Can't you feel it?

23:11.888 --> 23:14.091
Someone's watching us again.

23:15.846 --> 23:16.436
Ok.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.463
Can you... can you tell me who?

23:18.817 --> 23:20.627
I can't see them.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.843
I just feel them nearby.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.129
You know what?

23:27.638 --> 23:29.376
I'll go check it out, ok?

23:35.220 --> 23:36.372
Charlie?

23:36.788 --> 23:38.793
If this is you, knock it off, Ok?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.913
I'm just trying to help you.

23:43.383 --> 23:45.524
It's all clear, baby.

23:57.512 --> 23:59.331
You sure this is the right address?

23:59.331 --> 24:01.068
Yep, it's what the invoice says.

24:01.068 --> 24:02.786
Well, then, as far as gold diggers go,

24:02.786 --> 24:04.921
this Sherry's not the
sharpest pick axe in the shed.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.772
Yeah, well, maybe she is, and
this is what she left the guy.

24:08.790 --> 24:10.706
Don't give that woman my number.

24:11.047 --> 24:13.249
Todd? Lieber?

24:13.249 --> 24:14.638
In the flesh.

24:14.638 --> 24:16.388
What can I do you for?

24:18.379 --> 24:21.096
You don't know a woman named
Sherry, by any chance, do you?

24:21.096 --> 24:23.748
Sherry...my Sherry?

24:23.748 --> 24:25.395
Oh, my god.

24:25.395 --> 24:27.352
You found her.

24:27.783 --> 24:29.964
I'm really sorry to hear about Charlie.

24:29.964 --> 24:31.256
How long have you worked with him?

24:31.290 --> 24:33.908
Not very long. We're just
contacting all of his clients

24:33.908 --> 24:35.692
to make sure they've been debriefed.

24:36.937 --> 24:39.433
What? What is it?

24:40.052 --> 24:42.875
I messed up so bad.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.831
We've been a couple since high school.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.278
And I guess everyone
thought, me included,

24:47.278 --> 24:48.652
that would never change.

24:48.652 --> 24:50.121
And Sherry felt differently?

24:50.121 --> 24:52.423
Well, she must have, because she left.

24:52.423 --> 24:53.916
But you never would have known it.

24:53.916 --> 24:57.083
All she did since we got out of
school was bug me to marry her.

24:57.083 --> 25:00.992
Every time she'd ask, I'd
say, sure, yeah, sounds great.

25:00.992 --> 25:04.890
But, you know, let's wait till
all our ducks are in a row.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.117
What ducks were those?

25:06.428 --> 25:07.919
Well, you know,

25:07.919 --> 25:10.641
Like...me.

25:10.641 --> 25:12.523
- You? 
- I mean, come on.

25:12.557 --> 25:14.224
Marriage is for grown ups.

25:14.259 --> 25:16.093
For people who get out
of bed in the morning

25:16.127 --> 25:17.861
and take a lot of showers.

25:17.895 --> 25:19.795
It's for people who
balance their checkbooks

25:19.830 --> 25:22.518
and know how to, you
know, use their stoves.

25:22.518 --> 25:25.192
And it's not like I don't shower. I do.

25:25.192 --> 25:27.222
But not if I don't really need to.

25:27.222 --> 25:28.536
And I guess I thought

25:28.570 --> 25:30.327
getting married is like showering.

25:30.327 --> 25:32.406
Why do it if you don't really need to?

25:32.440 --> 25:34.458
And that went over big with Sherry, huh?

25:34.458 --> 25:36.289
For the first 8 years, she was fine.

25:36.289 --> 25:37.635
8 years?

25:37.635 --> 25:38.969
Yeah.

25:38.969 --> 25:42.138
We were great. Really great.

25:42.138 --> 25:44.519
But then suddenly she
started acting all weird,

25:44.519 --> 25:46.154
All kind of secretive.

25:46.154 --> 25:48.016
I asked her if she met another guy,

25:48.016 --> 25:49.720
she swore she hadn't.

25:49.754 --> 25:51.955
So I started wondering,

25:51.990 --> 25:53.923
what other secret could there be

25:53.958 --> 25:56.031
that she would have to keep from me.

25:56.031 --> 25:58.262
Then whammo.

25:58.262 --> 26:00.124
What if she's pregnant?

26:00.124 --> 26:03.496
What if she's pregnant, and she
doesn't think I'm ready to be a dad.

26:03.496 --> 26:04.306
Pregnant?

26:04.306 --> 26:05.889
I know, right?

26:05.889 --> 26:09.303
So I thought about being a
dad, how important that was.

26:09.337 --> 26:11.738
And I made up my mind.

26:12.045 --> 26:14.060
It was time to grow up.

26:14.387 --> 26:17.088
So one day, while it was still morning,

26:17.088 --> 26:18.632
I got out of bed,

26:18.632 --> 26:21.463
and I showered and I put on a shirt

26:21.463 --> 26:23.048
and I asked her to marry me.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.582
And what'd she say?

26:25.195 --> 26:26.593
Nothing.

26:26.593 --> 26:28.641
She just started crying.

26:28.641 --> 26:31.366
Like those were the worst
words I could possibly say.

26:31.366 --> 26:32.965
Then what happened?

26:32.965 --> 26:34.888
The next day, she was gone.

26:34.888 --> 26:36.199
Did you call the police?

26:36.199 --> 26:37.299
No.

26:37.299 --> 26:40.287
She left a note. I knew
she wasn't kidnapped.

26:40.287 --> 26:42.020
But I had to find her.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.810
I had to know what I did wrong.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.693
Plus, if she really was
pregnant with our baby, then...

26:46.693 --> 26:48.617
Ok, so how did you find Charlie?

26:48.617 --> 26:50.304
A parking ticket from Grandview

26:50.338 --> 26:53.043
showed up in the mailbox
3 weeks after Sherry left.

26:53.043 --> 26:55.531
I just looked in the phonebook,
and that's how I found him.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.144
I had to sell my truck
to come up with his fee.

26:58.178 --> 27:00.012
But it's good.

27:00.046 --> 27:02.434
I'm walking much more.
I've lost 10 pounds already.

27:02.434 --> 27:04.629
Well, what did Charlie
say? Did he find anything?

27:04.629 --> 27:07.031
He got some leads early on, yeah.

27:07.031 --> 27:09.653
But then he made it
sound like he'd lost her.

27:09.687 --> 27:10.920
Made it sound like? What do you mean?

27:10.955 --> 27:14.056
After a while, he kinda
stopped taking my checks.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.357
or my calls.

27:15.392 --> 27:16.692
I just figured he was a busy guy

27:16.726 --> 27:19.494
and he didn't have anything
else he could tell me.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.744
Why? Was there something
else he found out?

27:22.744 --> 27:24.331
We would have to check his files,

27:24.365 --> 27:26.867
but if we find anything,
we'll definitely let you know.

27:26.901 --> 27:28.468
We better get going.

27:28.502 --> 27:30.553
Call me as soon as
you hear anything, ok?

27:30.553 --> 27:31.968
You've got my number and address.

27:31.968 --> 27:34.024
Oh, just one more question...

27:34.024 --> 27:37.344
8351, does that mean anything to you?

27:38.590 --> 27:41.134
That was Sherry's parents
street address here in Weston.

27:41.134 --> 27:43.146
Ok, we'll be in touch.

27:44.815 --> 27:46.648
8351, what was that about?

27:46.683 --> 27:50.018
Maybe nothing. Maybe something.

27:51.654 --> 27:54.988
She took off the moment
he asked her to marry him.

27:54.988 --> 27:55.884
Yep.

27:55.884 --> 27:59.418
After 8 years of bugging him for a ring.

27:59.893 --> 28:01.486
And you said this guy, he's not rich?

28:01.486 --> 28:03.945
Well, he had to sell
his car to hire a P.I.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.664
All right, now am I
missing something here,

28:05.698 --> 28:09.234
or is Sherry not the gold digging
gold digger that everyone says she is?

28:09.268 --> 28:10.835
She's kind of the opposite.

28:13.041 --> 28:14.447
What's so interesting?

28:14.447 --> 28:16.046
The number that Aiden wrote,

28:16.046 --> 28:18.443
it's a combination of Todd
and Sherry's street addresses,

28:18.443 --> 28:20.444
624, 8351.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.032
You think he picked
them up from the ghost.

28:22.032 --> 28:23.170
Probably.

28:23.170 --> 28:24.289
Charlie's been hanging around.

28:24.289 --> 28:26.664
Aiden said he felt
like he was watching us.

28:27.717 --> 28:29.635
Aiden wouldn't be seeing these numbers

28:29.635 --> 28:31.730
unless it was something
important to the ghost.

28:31.730 --> 28:33.246
But why would it be important?

28:33.246 --> 28:35.204
It's just a couple of street addresses.

28:35.753 --> 28:37.459
Maybe it's more.

28:37.459 --> 28:40.358
Like what? And how am
I supposed to find it?

28:40.750 --> 28:43.553
Asks the woman who practically
spends her life on the internet?

28:43.553 --> 28:45.121
Good point.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.300
Congratulations, you have
one the lotta lottery!

28:53.335 --> 28:55.502
Oh, my god.

28:55.537 --> 28:59.004
It's a lottery number. A winning one.

28:59.004 --> 29:00.496
A big winning one?

29:00.496 --> 29:03.477
Sherry doesn't need anybody's gold.

29:03.781 --> 29:05.869
She's a multimillionaire.

29:11.000 --> 29:11.986
Are you sure?

29:11.986 --> 29:14.077
I thought you said her name
wasn't listed in the article.

29:14.077 --> 29:17.022
Well, the story said that the
winner wanted to remain anonymous.

29:17.022 --> 29:19.920
But they described her as a
25-year-old female from Weston.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.862
Ok, so when did she win?

29:21.862 --> 29:23.456
4 days before she left town.

29:23.456 --> 29:26.884
And 3 days before he suddenly
lost his cold feet and proposed?

29:26.884 --> 29:28.650
Look, he said he was
afraid she was pregnant,

29:28.650 --> 29:29.920
and so he asked her to marry him.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.782
Ok, or maybe she told him
that she won the lottery,

29:33.782 --> 29:36.704
hence his sudden conversion to marriage.

29:36.704 --> 29:38.925
Or maybe he found out and, you know,

29:38.925 --> 29:40.667
needed to pretend 'cause
he didn't want her to think

29:40.667 --> 29:42.120
that he married her for money.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.219
And maybe she saw through his act,

29:44.219 --> 29:45.628
and that's why she skipped town.

29:45.628 --> 29:47.286
Unless they bought the tickets together,

29:47.320 --> 29:49.142
and then she went running
away with his winnings.

29:49.142 --> 29:51.429
Right. But in that case,
they would both be liars,

29:51.429 --> 29:53.574
because he didn't mention
the lottery to you.

29:53.574 --> 29:57.184
Money like that brings
out the worst in everyone.

29:57.184 --> 29:58.407
Charlie.

29:58.407 --> 30:01.348
Oh, now you show up.
Where have you been?

30:01.348 --> 30:02.694
He's been around.

30:02.694 --> 30:05.635
Yeah, that's right. Skulking and spying

30:05.669 --> 30:07.824
and scaring everybody I
know while you're at it.

30:07.824 --> 30:09.680
Sorry about that. Old habits.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.911
I know why you wanted
me off Sherry's case.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.951
You were trying to
keep her money a secret.

30:13.951 --> 30:16.101
I saw what happened
when people found out.

30:16.101 --> 30:17.277
You mean Todd.

30:17.312 --> 30:18.674
What did he do?

30:18.674 --> 30:20.158
He broke Sherry's heart.

30:20.159 --> 30:22.360
That about face proposal?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.217
I mean, how dumb was he
thinking she wouldn't know

30:24.217 --> 30:26.598
why he changed his
mind about the marriage?

30:26.598 --> 30:28.844
She told you about his proposal?

30:28.844 --> 30:31.062
I guess you guys had
gotten pretty close.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.898
Well, I'm good at my job.

30:32.898 --> 30:33.951
What can I say?

30:33.951 --> 30:35.412
Why would you care if she ran?

30:35.412 --> 30:36.692
I mean, it got her away from Todd.

30:36.692 --> 30:40.105
All she wanted was someone to
love her for who she really is.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.010
She needs someone she can trust.

30:42.452 --> 30:43.957
What did he say?

30:44.503 --> 30:46.968
He was trying to help her find
somebody that she could trust.

30:47.003 --> 30:48.962
Oh, really? Like you,

30:48.962 --> 30:51.241
who never mentioned to
her why the two of you met,

30:51.241 --> 30:53.759
or you, who pretended not to
know that she won the lottery?

30:53.759 --> 30:56.564
Or you, who pretended you were a clown.

30:58.346 --> 31:01.211
So that you could spy on her boyfriend?

31:02.279 --> 31:04.068
Yeah, I'm a creep

31:04.068 --> 31:06.910
who wears costumes to sneak
around following people.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.853
And half the time, I
work for the bad guys.

31:08.853 --> 31:10.275
But sometimes,

31:10.275 --> 31:11.433
I dig up more than dirt.

31:11.433 --> 31:14.275
Sometimes, I dig up something good.

31:14.275 --> 31:17.092
Or someone, which is why
you were watching Sherry

31:17.126 --> 31:19.661
even though you told
Todd that you'd lost her.

31:20.314 --> 31:23.062
Look, here's this girl who
has millions of dollars,

31:23.062 --> 31:24.999
and she spends it like water.

31:24.999 --> 31:27.497
But guess how much
she spends on herself?

31:27.702 --> 31:28.950
Not one dime.

31:28.950 --> 31:30.609
Ok, so what does she spend it on?

31:30.609 --> 31:31.959
Charity.

31:31.959 --> 31:35.898
Every hopeless lost cause,
three-legged puppy she could find,

31:35.898 --> 31:37.680
And all anonymous.

31:38.083 --> 31:39.457
Sounds pretty special.

31:39.457 --> 31:41.713
Well, she deserves a lot
better than some lazy bum

31:41.747 --> 31:43.835
Looking to take a free
ride on the lotto train.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.947
It still doesn't explain
why you spied on Alex.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.084
He doesn't need a free ride.

31:47.084 --> 31:48.363
He's got plenty of money on his own.

31:48.363 --> 31:51.388
Yeah, well, sometimes these
rich guys like to play the field.

31:51.388 --> 31:54.019
So you were watching him to see
if he was dating anyone else.

31:55.543 --> 31:57.890
I wanted to know if
he was right for her.

31:59.226 --> 32:01.716
And I still do.

32:04.517 --> 32:06.531
How many millions?

32:06.531 --> 32:09.055
That's more zeroes than
I have actual dollars.

32:09.055 --> 32:11.603
Remember when I said not
to give Sherry my number?

32:11.638 --> 32:13.672
Yeah, I'm reappraising that.

32:13.706 --> 32:15.047
Uh-oh, gotta go.

32:15.047 --> 32:16.451
Hey, I know you.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.312
Where's your uniform?

32:20.346 --> 32:22.747
It's, um, uh, it's my day off.

32:23.752 --> 32:27.229
Why does your bag have
a Rockland U. ID on it?

32:27.229 --> 32:28.979
Professor James.

32:29.655 --> 32:31.996
It's my brother. My twin brother.

32:31.996 --> 32:34.798
Teaches psychology.
He's extremely talented.

32:35.372 --> 32:37.494
Man, I could use a shrink right now.

32:37.494 --> 32:38.504
Really?

32:38.955 --> 32:42.128
I want to strangle my dad for
giving away my wedding ring.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.714
It's so oedipal!

32:43.714 --> 32:46.056
Actually, that sounds a little
bit more like Electra than Oedipus.

32:46.723 --> 32:48.433
I'm sure my twin brother would say.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.112
So your dad gave your ring away?

32:50.112 --> 32:52.109
I just knew he was
going to marry goldie.

32:52.143 --> 32:54.911
He gave away my grandma's ring,
it was supposed to be mine!

32:54.946 --> 32:56.112
Goldie?

32:56.147 --> 32:58.399
I call her goldie because
she's a gold digger.

32:58.399 --> 33:00.407
I knew she'd pawn the
ring the second she got it,

33:00.407 --> 33:02.385
so I wanted to make sure
it was worth something.

33:02.910 --> 33:05.335
She did it before it
was even on her finger.

33:06.342 --> 33:08.152
Is that what the jeweler just told you?

33:08.152 --> 33:10.735
She pulled the same stunt
she did with the earrings.

33:10.735 --> 33:13.661
Now there's 2 carets of cubic
z where the diamond used to be.

33:13.661 --> 33:16.037
Really? What do you think
she did with the money?

33:16.037 --> 33:18.259
Bought drugs, I hope.

33:18.259 --> 33:20.912
At least then my father
will see she's not worth it.

33:20.912 --> 33:21.955
As if he'd listen.

33:21.955 --> 33:23.580
'cause when you told
him about the earrings,

33:23.580 --> 33:24.860
he didn't even blink.

33:24.860 --> 33:25.983
Which is insane!

33:25.983 --> 33:27.222
And I googled her.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.926
Parks isn't even her last name.

33:29.926 --> 33:31.704
And when I told him, guess what he did.

33:31.704 --> 33:33.774
He got online and
researched her himself.

33:33.774 --> 33:35.511
After that, he was full steam ahead.

33:35.511 --> 33:36.914
He fell even more in love with her.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.278
How dumb does he have to be to do that?

33:39.632 --> 33:41.185
That's a good question.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.247
Ok, thanks, Tom.

33:45.282 --> 33:48.316
I promise I won't breathe a
word about how I heard. Bye.

33:48.351 --> 33:50.339
Well, this confirms Eli's hunch.

33:50.339 --> 33:52.502
Sherry's new boyfriend
is basically broke.

33:52.502 --> 33:54.883
How? I mean, he owns all those stores.

33:54.883 --> 33:56.916
Yeah, and mortgaged beyond the hilt.

33:56.916 --> 33:59.242
And this is not a good
time to be over-extended.

33:59.242 --> 34:01.324
So Alex must have found out
that Sherry won the lottery

34:01.324 --> 34:02.901
And that's why he started
giving her jewelry.

34:02.901 --> 34:04.789
To make it look like he
didn't need her millions.

34:04.789 --> 34:07.164
And it cost him nothing because
he pawned off the diamonds

34:07.164 --> 34:08.299
to stave off the creditors.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.650
So how did Brittany know that
her father was going to propose?

34:10.650 --> 34:13.004
He's been planning a special trip.

34:13.004 --> 34:16.210
Yeah, him and Sherry. To Las Vegas.

34:16.210 --> 34:17.608
He's such a romantic.

34:17.608 --> 34:20.212
He keeps dropping hints that he
wants Elvis to be the best man.

34:20.212 --> 34:20.984
Oh, boy.

34:20.984 --> 34:22.396
- It gets worse. 
- How?

34:22.396 --> 34:24.157
There's a limo outside
their house right now.

34:24.157 --> 34:25.625
They're leaving for the airport.

34:25.625 --> 34:27.835
- What? 
- Sherry's being taken for a ride.

34:27.835 --> 34:29.522
We need to stop them.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.043
You ready to go, babe?

34:43.043 --> 34:44.868
Um, yeah, sure.

34:44.902 --> 34:47.002
Can't wait.

34:59.664 --> 35:00.856
Sherry!

35:01.379 --> 35:02.597
Are you here?

35:02.597 --> 35:04.185
Sherry!

35:05.505 --> 35:06.852
Thank god we're not too late.

35:06.852 --> 35:07.808
Excuse me.

35:07.871 --> 35:09.737
I hate to be rude, but
we have a plane to catch.

35:09.737 --> 35:10.891
I know you.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.825
You're from the antique store.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.393
What are you doing here?

35:14.427 --> 35:16.249
I'm here to look after you,

35:16.249 --> 35:19.048
because Charlie Hammond
can't do that anymore.

35:19.048 --> 35:20.741
Baby, we gotta hit the road.

35:20.741 --> 35:23.155
Whatever it is, I'll
call you when I get back.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.769
Get in that car now,
and it'll be too late.

35:25.803 --> 35:28.972
- Too late for what? 
- He knows.

35:29.006 --> 35:31.107
Alex knows that you're rich.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.587
What are you talking about?

35:33.587 --> 35:34.608
Sherry, we have to go.

35:34.608 --> 35:36.544
In just a minute. I want to hear this.

35:37.311 --> 35:39.814
What is it that you think you know?

35:39.814 --> 35:41.183
You didn't even know Charlie.

35:41.183 --> 35:42.614
No, I didn't.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.000
Not when he was alive.

35:44.034 --> 35:46.269
But I've talked to him since,

35:46.303 --> 35:48.320
and I can explain. I will.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.872
Look, I don't know who
you two people are, but...

35:49.906 --> 35:53.541
There's a reason that he was at
the party that day when he died.

35:55.110 --> 35:57.415
Was he working for you?

35:57.992 --> 36:00.338
Is that why you've been pushing
to take this trip so hard?

36:00.338 --> 36:01.748
All the marriage talk?

36:01.748 --> 36:03.483
Are we talking about
the poor, dead clown...

36:03.517 --> 36:04.650
See, I've been wondering
who hired Charlie,

36:04.685 --> 36:06.485
what he was doing here at the party

36:06.519 --> 36:08.853
ever since I read his obit
and saw that he was a P.I.

36:08.887 --> 36:11.252
Charlie was never working for Alex.

36:11.252 --> 36:14.418
At that point, he was really
just looking after you.

36:14.418 --> 36:17.047
But when Alex found out that
a P.I. had died in his house,

36:17.047 --> 36:18.744
he decided to cover up the story.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.426
Look, I want you people out
of my house, off my property.

36:21.426 --> 36:22.500
Cover it up, why?

36:22.500 --> 36:24.174
Because he thought that
Charlie was snooping around,

36:24.174 --> 36:25.645
and if people were
snooping around Charlie,

36:25.645 --> 36:26.838
then they'd find out your secret.

36:26.838 --> 36:28.674
And if everyone knew that
you had won the lottery...

36:28.674 --> 36:30.406
Then he couldn't pretend
to not know himself.

36:30.406 --> 36:32.512
Why would I need to not know anything?

36:32.512 --> 36:35.526
Because you're a gold digging
scum sucker.That's why.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.856
Todd?!

36:36.856 --> 36:38.645
Who's the homeless guy?

36:49.121 --> 36:53.926
The benevolent electronics king
isn't going to press any charges.

36:53.926 --> 36:56.013
He doesn't need the
extra publicity right now,

36:56.013 --> 36:58.068
especially not this kind.

36:58.846 --> 37:01.030
Are you sure that you're ok?

37:01.064 --> 37:02.731
You look terrible.

37:02.766 --> 37:04.587
I just spent the night
in the woods, is all.

37:04.587 --> 37:07.602
Wait, you tracked us from
Weston to Grandview on foot?

37:07.602 --> 37:09.632
I could tell you had
something on Sherry.

37:09.632 --> 37:10.498
No offense,

37:10.498 --> 37:12.319
but you guys don't look much like P.I.s.

37:12.319 --> 37:14.408
None taken, I'm sure.

37:15.577 --> 37:19.680
So I, uh, guess you
were pretty desperate

37:19.714 --> 37:21.481
not to lose me and my money.

37:21.515 --> 37:24.362
I didn't sell my ride
just to find you, girl.

37:24.362 --> 37:26.465
I got 9 grand for that quad cab.

37:26.465 --> 37:28.389
Four went to that P.I. Charlie,

37:28.389 --> 37:30.912
and the other five I socked
away for college for T-Bone.

37:30.912 --> 37:32.024
T-Bone?

37:32.024 --> 37:34.224
I always dreamed I'd name my firstborn

37:34.259 --> 37:35.743
for my favorite blues man.

37:35.743 --> 37:38.015
- But if it's a girl... 
- Your firstborn?

37:38.015 --> 37:41.431
Well, ours, actually.

37:42.346 --> 37:44.567
I thought you were pregnant.

37:44.602 --> 37:46.669
But you're not, are you?

37:47.648 --> 37:49.074
No.

37:51.068 --> 37:53.091
You just ran because
you didn't trust me.

37:53.525 --> 37:57.027
You expect me to believe that you
had no idea I'd won the lottery?

37:57.027 --> 38:00.240
Babe, when's the last time
you saw me touch a newspaper?

38:00.274 --> 38:03.139
I just... I don't know.

38:03.173 --> 38:06.095
You don't know if you trust me?

38:06.707 --> 38:09.002
Or if I'm who you want to be with now?

38:09.484 --> 38:11.321
So much has happened.

38:13.275 --> 38:15.634
I can't figure out what's right.

38:16.371 --> 38:19.442
Well... whatever you do,

38:19.442 --> 38:20.658
I'm ok.

38:20.658 --> 38:21.638
You know?

38:21.638 --> 38:23.061
What do you mean?

38:23.061 --> 38:24.763
When I thought I was going to be a dad,

38:24.763 --> 38:27.494
I realized I had to stop
seeing myself as a loser.

38:27.494 --> 38:29.900
Because someone else, my kid,

38:29.900 --> 38:32.278
was going to see me as
this awesome grown-up,

38:32.278 --> 38:34.404
no matter what I really am.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.459
Plus, which...

38:36.459 --> 38:38.747
you were with me a really long time,

38:38.747 --> 38:40.491
and wanting to marry me.

38:40.491 --> 38:44.340
And that means you must
have seen something in me.

38:44.375 --> 38:46.042
So...

38:46.560 --> 38:49.678
If I'm ever lucky enough to
find someone like you again...

39:00.163 --> 39:01.773
I'll sign a pre-nup.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.686
I'll bunk in the trailer
behind your new mansion.

39:03.686 --> 39:05.630
Will you shut up?

39:08.387 --> 39:10.028
You tell them I'm sorry.

39:10.028 --> 39:12.074
I didn't mean to keep them apart.

39:12.074 --> 39:14.890
They'll understand. It's
your job not to trust people.

39:14.890 --> 39:16.307
Yeah. You didn't even trust me.

39:16.307 --> 39:17.586
I mean, you gave me all those visions

39:17.586 --> 39:19.306
even though you knew
I was trying to help.

39:19.306 --> 39:20.346
What visions?

39:20.346 --> 39:22.599
The whole fishbowl
thing in my living room?

39:22.599 --> 39:24.258
People staring at me.

39:24.258 --> 39:25.899
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:25.899 --> 39:27.831
Is Charlie here?

39:30.346 --> 39:33.380
Will you tell him thanks
for looking out for me?

39:34.175 --> 39:37.934
Should I tell her the real
reason you've hung in for so long?

39:37.934 --> 39:40.720
I probably won't get another chance.

39:44.399 --> 39:45.920
Ask Todd.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.261
Sherry's the kind of girl, the
more time you spend with her,

39:48.261 --> 39:49.947
the crazier things you'll do.

39:50.476 --> 39:52.324
Sleep in the woods,

39:52.324 --> 39:54.232
jog across the county,

39:54.800 --> 39:57.435
even dress up as a clown.

39:57.469 --> 40:00.204
Not even death could slow you down.

40:00.238 --> 40:01.939
No.

40:08.045 --> 40:09.878
But that might.

40:09.913 --> 40:12.514
You see the light?

40:12.548 --> 40:13.879
Yeah.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.808
It's filled with people.

40:15.808 --> 40:17.892
You know how I feel about people.

40:17.892 --> 40:19.317
Yeah.

40:19.317 --> 40:22.223
But Charlie, this place is different.

40:22.707 --> 40:25.234
I can feel it.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.118
Feel what?

40:28.229 --> 40:30.529
Trust.

40:31.865 --> 40:34.466
Blind, senseless,

40:34.501 --> 40:36.735
bottomless trust.

40:37.348 --> 40:39.295
Not so bad, is it?

40:43.596 --> 40:46.145
Will you tell Sherry what I said?

40:46.180 --> 40:47.852
Trust me.

41:03.663 --> 41:06.210
I just kissed our
sleeping son good night.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.126
How long does it take
to get him to go down?

41:09.126 --> 41:11.369
Even longer than usual.

41:13.672 --> 41:16.428
Is he still thinking
somebody's watching him?

41:17.630 --> 41:18.696
I don't get it.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.656
Didn't that private
eye go into the light?

41:21.034 --> 41:22.656
I don't think it's that ghost.

41:22.656 --> 41:25.288
What is it? Is it a shadow

41:25.288 --> 41:27.775
or a shiny or another ghost?

41:28.068 --> 41:30.402
He says it's something different.

41:31.469 --> 41:32.578
That's good.

41:36.483 --> 41:39.017
Ok, I gotta go...

41:39.051 --> 41:42.340
Transcribe some patient
notes downstairs.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.137
- Good night. 
- Good night.

41:47.971 --> 41:50.028
Bedford.

41:50.460 --> 41:52.063
What are you doing here?

41:53.864 --> 41:56.189
You should listen to your son.

41:57.485 --> 42:00.350
What are you talking
about? What do you want?

42:00.350 --> 42:02.552
It was never about what I want.

42:02.552 --> 42:05.036
But it could be about what you want.

42:05.664 --> 42:06.988
What do you mean?

42:09.135 --> 42:10.807
You want to live.

42:11.422 --> 42:13.463
Come on, you can do better than that.

42:13.895 --> 42:16.836
You owe me, especially after
what you almost did to my friends.

42:16.836 --> 42:18.708
Owe you?

42:18.708 --> 42:22.286
I've given up my life and my mother's,

42:22.286 --> 42:24.906
and I'm still not done paying.

42:32.410 --> 42:33.972
What's happening?

42:34.372 --> 42:36.259
Remember this...

42:36.259 --> 42:38.440
Nothing is what it seems.

42:39.191 --> 42:41.110
Nothing and no one.

42:42.324 --> 42:44.226
I don't understand.

42:44.226 --> 42:47.717
Trust nothing and no one.
