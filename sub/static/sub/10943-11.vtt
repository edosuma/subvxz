WEBVTT

00:01.624 --> 00:03.125
<i>I wanna work with him.</i>

00:03.192 --> 00:05.360
Why? He's crazy
and dangerous.

00:08.897 --> 00:10.865
<i>- All right, dad,</i>
<i>- I just wanted to say</i>

00:10.933 --> 00:12.366
I've been thinking about
what you said about,

00:12.434 --> 00:14.335
uh, seeing
the grand canyon?

00:14.402 --> 00:15.536
Yeah.

00:15.604 --> 00:17.238
Maybe we could do that
one day.

00:17.305 --> 00:19.640
Any idea when that day
might be?

00:19.707 --> 00:21.542
- <i>- Wade? What're you doing here?</i>

00:21.610 --> 00:23.244
I thought maybe
by paying your tuition,

00:23.311 --> 00:25.446
we could just balance the bad
with some good.

00:25.514 --> 00:27.114
I don't want your money,
I don't need your money,

00:27.181 --> 00:28.914
and I don't want you
around here!

00:28.982 --> 00:31.817
You want to hang out
with Wade?

00:31.885 --> 00:33.186
Fine.

00:33.254 --> 00:34.954
But then you gotta leave me
out of your life.

00:35.022 --> 00:37.657
Hey, Lily, what's up?

00:37.724 --> 00:39.925
Maybe it's time we could
all put the past behind us.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.164
Hey, Alcatraz.

00:46.533 --> 00:49.034
Are you gonna be
a good boy?

00:53.273 --> 00:55.040
It's okay...
It's okay...

01:01.680 --> 01:02.746
All right.

01:10.422 --> 01:11.489
Good boy...

01:18.696 --> 01:21.130
- Ungh! Agh!

01:22.900 --> 01:24.467
Fine! Be that way!

01:27.605 --> 01:29.138
Hello.

01:29.207 --> 01:30.707
Hey, where are you?

01:30.774 --> 01:33.141
Uh, I'm...
I'm just heading out the door.

01:33.210 --> 01:34.677
You're still at the field,
aren't you?

01:34.744 --> 01:37.079
I'm sorry, I just totally
lost track of time!

01:37.146 --> 01:39.715
<i>I'm really making some</i>
<i>good progress with Alcatraz.</i>

01:39.782 --> 01:41.650
Well, that's great, okay,
but she's gonna be here soon.

01:41.718 --> 01:43.051
Can you hurry up?

01:43.119 --> 01:44.186
- Okay. I'm on my way.
- I know.

01:44.254 --> 01:45.521
- <i>- 'Kay.</i>

01:45.589 --> 01:46.988
Oh my God!

01:48.190 --> 01:49.591
Agh! Damn!

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.268 --> 02:02.537
All right, I'm here
and I brought the flowers.

02:02.605 --> 02:03.770
Oh! Thank you so much.

02:03.838 --> 02:04.971
This looks great.

02:05.039 --> 02:06.906
Yeah, I guess.

02:06.974 --> 02:08.609
Except I overcooked
the pasta,

02:08.675 --> 02:10.175
and I used canned
tomato sauce.

02:10.245 --> 02:11.311
I should've bought
the stuff in the jar,

02:11.379 --> 02:12.812
but it's just,
it's expensive.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.180
It just tastes way better,
but...

02:14.249 --> 02:16.216
I like the canned sauce.

02:16.284 --> 02:18.918
Uh, when did you put
the dressing on the salad?

02:18.986 --> 02:20.720
A while ago. Why?

02:20.787 --> 02:23.289
It just gets a little soggy,
that's all.

02:23.357 --> 02:24.490
Oh, here. Here.
No. It'll be fine. Ty!

02:24.558 --> 02:25.824
No, no, no.
I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

02:25.892 --> 02:28.861
She's not coming here
for a gourmet meal, okay?

02:28.928 --> 02:29.895
She's coming to see you.

02:29.963 --> 02:32.798
No, I know.
It's just...

02:32.866 --> 02:34.300
Last time she was here,
everything sucked,

02:34.368 --> 02:35.833
and I just want it
to be right this time.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.875
You go. I got this.
Okay, okay.

02:45.678 --> 02:46.944
Hey, Ty!

02:47.012 --> 02:48.246
Hey, mom.

02:48.314 --> 02:50.615
Oh... oh... mm!

02:53.151 --> 02:54.418
Every time I see you

02:54.486 --> 02:57.187
I can't get over
how grown up you are.

02:57.255 --> 02:58.589
Oh, and so handsome.

02:58.657 --> 02:59.790
Okay, okay...

02:59.857 --> 03:01.224
I'm sorry.
I'm embarrassing you.

03:01.293 --> 03:04.027
How often do I get
to do that?

03:04.095 --> 03:05.429
Hi, Lily.
Hi!

03:05.497 --> 03:07.030
Oh!

03:07.098 --> 03:08.164
Amy.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.203
Hello, my little pumpkin!
My pumpkin!

03:14.271 --> 03:17.173
Mmmuah!
I missed you so much!

03:17.240 --> 03:19.375
You would not believe
the day I had.

03:19.443 --> 03:20.543
I'd love to talk about it,

03:20.611 --> 03:22.312
but I was off the clock
two hours ago.

03:22.379 --> 03:24.313
I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

03:24.380 --> 03:25.747
I do have a life,
you know.

03:25.815 --> 03:27.416
I mean, I may not have
a boyfriend

03:27.483 --> 03:29.484
or an invite to Jamie's
stupid pool party,

03:29.552 --> 03:31.420
but still,
you could have called.

03:31.487 --> 03:33.388
I tried.
I really, really did,

03:33.456 --> 03:34.889
but it was just such
a crazy day.

03:34.957 --> 03:38.026
I was just cleaning up
one mess after the other.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.694
Oh...

03:39.761 --> 03:42.963
Looks like you're just in time
to clean up another mess.

03:43.031 --> 03:44.097
Bye.

03:46.901 --> 03:48.068
Whew! Stinky!

03:50.472 --> 03:51.305
Well, can I get you
anything else?

03:51.373 --> 03:52.740
There's lots more inside.

03:52.808 --> 03:53.874
No. No, thank you,
I'm stuffed.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.075
Okay.

03:55.143 --> 03:56.976
When did you become
such a good cook?

03:57.044 --> 03:58.778
It wasn't really that good,
I...

03:58.846 --> 04:00.980
Yes, it was.
Everything was perfect.

04:01.048 --> 04:02.248
It was perfect.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.918
I loved the salad dressing.

04:05.986 --> 04:07.354
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>look at you...</i>

04:07.421 --> 04:08.888
Going to school,
you got your own place,

04:08.956 --> 04:11.324
and a beautiful girlfriend.

04:11.391 --> 04:12.358
Okay...

04:12.425 --> 04:13.892
Thanks, mom.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.026
How 'bout I clear
some of this?

04:15.094 --> 04:16.728
Here. Please let me
give you a hand.

04:16.796 --> 04:19.096
Oh, Lily,
you just... stay and...

04:19.165 --> 04:20.798
You guys have a lot
of catching up to do, right?

04:21.868 --> 04:23.268
Thank you.

04:32.177 --> 04:34.412
Why don't I show you
around?

04:34.480 --> 04:37.214
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd like that very much.

04:42.087 --> 04:45.188
This is such
a lovely spot.

04:45.256 --> 04:47.323
Yeah, I like it here.

04:47.392 --> 04:48.792
It's nice to have
my own place,

04:48.860 --> 04:50.994
even if it's just a trailer.

04:51.061 --> 04:52.562
Plus, the rent's cheap.

05:02.639 --> 05:03.739
Mom?

05:05.842 --> 05:07.943
Is everything all right?

05:08.879 --> 05:10.212
<i>You okay?</i>

05:12.181 --> 05:15.050
Ty, I need to tell you
something.

05:15.118 --> 05:16.851
You didn't just come here
for a visit, did you?

05:16.919 --> 05:19.086
No, I'm afraid not.

05:21.624 --> 05:22.891
It's about your dad.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.025
Is he in jail?

05:24.092 --> 05:25.259
No, it's not that.

05:25.327 --> 05:26.694
Did you lend him
some money then?

05:26.762 --> 05:27.829
Ty...

05:28.764 --> 05:30.532
Your dad's...

05:31.466 --> 05:33.400
He's gone.

05:33.468 --> 05:34.735
He passed away.

05:55.388 --> 06:02.361
♪ and at the break of day
you sank into your dream ♪

06:02.429 --> 06:03.662
♪ you dreamer ♪

06:03.729 --> 06:06.598
♪ oh, oh, oh... ♪

06:06.666 --> 06:08.700
♪ you dreamer ♪

06:10.770 --> 06:15.474
♪ you dreamer ♪

06:22.547 --> 06:23.747
Let me give you a hand
with that.

06:23.815 --> 06:25.049
That's all right.
I got it.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.650
You should be catching up
with your mom.

06:26.718 --> 06:28.752
Uh, we're all caught up.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.887
Here.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.657
Well...
Is everything okay?

06:34.559 --> 06:36.759
Would you mind keeping
my mom company?

06:36.827 --> 06:39.296
I'll be out in a second.

06:39.364 --> 06:40.397
Yup.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.937
So I hope you've saved room
for dessert

06:48.006 --> 06:52.174
because Lou has invited us over
for some tea and pie.

06:52.242 --> 06:54.377
Sounds nice.
How's Ty?

06:54.444 --> 06:56.979
Oh, he's...
Washing the dishes.

06:57.914 --> 07:00.682
He didn't tell you
did he?

07:00.750 --> 07:01.884
What?

07:03.553 --> 07:06.622
Brad had a heart attack.
He passed away.

07:19.235 --> 07:20.701
Oh, dammit!

07:25.373 --> 07:26.907
What happened?

07:26.974 --> 07:28.509
- Nothing.
- I'm just...

07:28.576 --> 07:29.843
<i>I'm just clumsy.</i>

07:29.911 --> 07:31.345
Careful, careful.
You'll cut yourself.

07:31.413 --> 07:32.479
- No, it's okay!
- It's okay, I got it, mom.

07:32.547 --> 07:33.980
Don't worry about it,
I got it.

07:34.049 --> 07:35.416
It's okay,
I've got a broom.

07:35.483 --> 07:37.484
- Look, look, it's okay!
- Okay, guys?

07:37.552 --> 07:38.885
I'll clean up later
when I get back, okay?

07:38.953 --> 07:41.054
Let's just...
Let's go to the ranch.

07:41.121 --> 07:43.122
We're going to be late.

07:54.834 --> 07:57.670
<i>Hey, you two,</i>
<i>how'd the big dinner go?</i>

07:57.737 --> 07:59.071
It was fine, grandpa.

07:59.138 --> 08:00.405
Uh, Ty and I are just gonna go
for a quick walk.

08:00.473 --> 08:03.308
<i>Do you mind saving us</i>
<i>some pie?</i>

08:03.376 --> 08:04.843
Lily!

08:04.911 --> 08:06.410
<i>Good to see you!</i>

08:06.478 --> 08:07.745
Hi, Jack.

08:07.813 --> 08:08.780
Welcome back.

08:08.847 --> 08:10.414
Thank you.

08:10.482 --> 08:12.083
Oh, you know,
driving in here,

08:12.150 --> 08:13.517
I forgot
how beautiful it is.

08:13.586 --> 08:15.620
It's like a little piece
of heaven.

08:15.688 --> 08:17.655
Well,
speaking of heaven,

08:17.723 --> 08:19.891
wait till you taste
Lou's lemon meringue pie.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.092
You're gonna love
that too.

08:21.159 --> 08:22.626
Come on in.

08:24.562 --> 08:26.797
So what happens now?

08:26.864 --> 08:29.265
Is there going to be
a funeral?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.734
I don't know.

08:31.903 --> 08:34.437
I don't why
she just didn't phone.

08:34.505 --> 08:36.873
Didn't have to come
all the way out here.

08:36.941 --> 08:38.140
I guess this is
the kind of news

08:38.207 --> 08:40.977
that you tell someone
in person.

08:42.212 --> 08:45.948
I just wanted to have
a normal visit with her.

08:46.016 --> 08:48.150
I guess we're not normal.

08:49.352 --> 08:51.087
You know, Ty, um...

08:51.154 --> 08:53.722
She's probably really
upset about this.

08:53.789 --> 08:55.389
Yeah,

08:55.457 --> 08:56.958
it's always a crisis
with my mom.

08:57.026 --> 08:58.559
He was her husband.

08:58.628 --> 09:00.061
Yeah, he was.

09:01.030 --> 09:02.998
They haven't been together
for over 15 years.

09:05.234 --> 09:08.637
I don't know why she's making
such a big deal out of it.

09:08.704 --> 09:11.739
She should've just
stayed home.

09:18.546 --> 09:20.080
Oh...

09:20.148 --> 09:22.182
She is so precious, Lou.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.251
I mean it,
she's perfect.

09:24.318 --> 09:26.719
- Who, this little monster?
- Yeah...

09:26.787 --> 09:28.487
We say thank you!

09:29.389 --> 09:31.958
So, how are things going for you
in Vancouver, Lily?

09:32.026 --> 09:34.761
- Oh, really good.
- Really good.

09:34.828 --> 09:38.230
I know I was a bit of a mess
when you saw me last,

09:38.298 --> 09:39.565
but moving back
to the coast,

09:39.633 --> 09:40.900
it was the best thing
I could have done.

09:40.968 --> 09:44.836
I have a really good job
and my own place...

09:44.904 --> 09:47.773
Well, you might think
I'm a bit of a flake,

09:47.840 --> 09:49.207
but I've been seeing
this therapist

09:49.275 --> 09:52.678
and it's completely
changed my life.

09:52.745 --> 09:55.380
Well, we all need someone
to talk to.

09:55.447 --> 09:57.348
<i>For the first
time</i> <i>in a long time,</i>

09:57.416 --> 09:58.749
I feel like I've got
a handle on things...

09:58.817 --> 10:01.318
like I'm in the driver's seat,
you know?

10:01.386 --> 10:03.620
Good for you, Lily.
That's great.

10:03.689 --> 10:06.791
And my only regret is
not coming to visit sooner.

10:06.858 --> 10:08.793
Well, we're sure glad
you're here.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.861
Now let's have
some of this pie.

10:10.929 --> 10:14.030
Jack, before you do that,

10:14.098 --> 10:16.632
there's something
I need to tell you...

10:16.701 --> 10:18.068
About Ty's dad.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.143
You gonna be okay
in here?

10:27.211 --> 10:28.377
It gets kinda cold
at night.

10:28.445 --> 10:29.712
I'll be fine.

10:29.779 --> 10:33.381
It's nice, actually.
It's kinda cozy.

10:33.449 --> 10:34.717
Well, I'll let you
get some rest.

10:34.784 --> 10:35.951
You must be
pretty exhausted.

10:36.019 --> 10:37.452
Ty, wait.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.190
There's something
we need to discuss.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.526
Brad told the Chaplin
at the hospital

10:44.594 --> 10:48.395
he wanted his surviving family
to spread his ashes.

10:48.463 --> 10:50.832
I thought maybe tomorrow
we could find a spot...

10:50.899 --> 10:54.102
wait, wait, wait,
wait, mom.

10:54.169 --> 10:57.071
You brought his ashes here?

10:57.139 --> 10:59.473
It's what he wanted.

10:59.541 --> 11:02.475
Ty,
we're his only family.

11:02.543 --> 11:05.912
You don't treat family
the way he treated us.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.513
You're right.

11:07.581 --> 11:09.750
He made a lot of mistakes.

11:09.817 --> 11:10.917
Mistakes?

11:12.019 --> 11:13.787
That's a pretty kind way
to put it.

11:13.855 --> 11:15.756
Well,
it doesn't matter now.

11:15.823 --> 11:17.257
He's gone.

11:18.191 --> 11:19.491
Look, Ty,
we need to forgive him.

11:19.559 --> 11:20.726
We gotta move on.

11:20.794 --> 11:23.562
What other choice
is there?

11:25.665 --> 11:26.866
So when you come by
tomorrow,

11:26.933 --> 11:31.170
we'll just talk
about a place, okay?

11:31.238 --> 11:33.639
Some place peaceful.

11:35.407 --> 11:36.941
Your dad didn't have
a lot of that in his life.

11:37.009 --> 11:39.911
Maybe we can help him
find it now.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.026
You sure you don't want me
to come in with you?

11:56.094 --> 11:57.394
Yeah,
I'm pretty beat.

11:57.461 --> 12:00.463
I'm just gonna hit
the hay.

12:00.531 --> 12:03.066
Maybe you shouldn't be
alone tonight.

12:03.134 --> 12:04.868
No... it's okay.

12:05.936 --> 12:06.869
I'll call you
in the morning, okay?

12:08.071 --> 12:09.571
Okay.

13:29.327 --> 13:30.161
Hey! Hey...

13:33.265 --> 13:35.399
No, no,
I'm at the ranch.

13:37.502 --> 13:39.735
No. Of course
I haven't told Ty yet.

13:39.804 --> 13:41.504
Well, now's not a good time.

13:44.775 --> 13:47.210
<i>I have to go.</i>

13:47.278 --> 13:49.112
I am so sorry.

13:49.180 --> 13:50.446
It's so early

13:50.514 --> 13:53.116
and I should've turned
the ringer off.

13:53.184 --> 13:54.917
<i>I was just getting</i>
<i>a glass of water.</i>

13:54.984 --> 13:56.952
Yeah, me too.
I think I'll do the same.

13:59.555 --> 14:01.523
<i>You know, Lily,</i>

14:01.590 --> 14:04.192
I only met Ty's dad
the once...

14:06.561 --> 14:09.263
and I don't mean to speak ill
of the dead...

14:09.331 --> 14:13.067
but I can't say he left
a good impression.

14:13.135 --> 14:15.036
I heard he stole money
from you.

14:15.103 --> 14:17.771
It wasn't so much the money.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.208
Uh... it was more the secrets
he was keeping from Ty.

14:21.275 --> 14:23.743
You know, I'm sure that Brad
probably thought

14:23.811 --> 14:26.612
he was protecting his son,
but...

14:26.680 --> 14:29.983
In the end,
Ty's the one that got hurt.

14:30.051 --> 14:33.653
That's the thing about secrets,
you just...

14:33.721 --> 14:36.488
Well, nothing ever good
comes of them.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.595
I'm gonna try and get
a few more winks.

14:57.009 --> 14:58.309
Good morning.

14:59.211 --> 15:00.879
Morning.

15:00.946 --> 15:02.180
You're up early.

15:02.248 --> 15:04.182
Yeah, I gotta run
into the city today.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.384
I got some errands
to run on campus.

15:06.451 --> 15:07.751
Today?

15:07.818 --> 15:09.152
What about your mom?

15:09.220 --> 15:10.787
Well, I shouldn't be
too long,

15:10.855 --> 15:12.956
unless there's a lineup
at the bookstore.

15:13.024 --> 15:15.492
<i>Hey, do you mind maybe just</i>
<i>hanging out with my mom today,</i>

15:15.559 --> 15:16.894
just till I get back?

15:17.828 --> 15:19.829
Um... yeah, I guess.

15:19.898 --> 15:22.132
I just never know
what to say to her.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.366
Well, you don't have
to say anything,

15:23.433 --> 15:25.434
you just keep her busy.

15:26.770 --> 15:27.836
All right.

15:41.050 --> 15:43.818
This... isn't
what it looks like.

15:43.886 --> 15:45.353
Really.

15:45.421 --> 15:48.589
'Cause it looks like
you spent the night at Ty's.

15:48.657 --> 15:49.824
Okay, it is
what it looks like,

15:49.892 --> 15:51.192
but it's not
what you think.

15:51.260 --> 15:52.327
You don't have
to explain.

15:52.395 --> 15:54.796
Lily told us everything
last night.

15:54.863 --> 15:56.030
How is Ty?

15:56.965 --> 15:58.865
I wish I knew.

15:58.934 --> 16:00.801
You know, just when I think
we're getting close,

16:00.868 --> 16:03.203
he shuts me out again.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.706
Probably gonna up
and down a few times.

16:06.774 --> 16:10.044
All you can do
is be there, right?

16:10.111 --> 16:11.177
Yeah.

16:17.717 --> 16:19.685
What're you doing here, Lou?
Shouldn't you be at work?

16:19.753 --> 16:20.987
Yeah, I'm on my way.

16:21.055 --> 16:24.824
I just wanted to drop
this off for you.

16:26.293 --> 16:28.093
You didn't have to do that.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.561
Well, I hope you
like pineapple.

16:32.565 --> 16:35.334
Ty, I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

16:36.269 --> 16:37.336
Thanks.

16:38.671 --> 16:40.138
Your mom was asking
about you.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.573
She was wondering

16:41.640 --> 16:43.040
if you were going to come
by the ranch today.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.711
Well, I'll try,
but...

16:47.779 --> 16:48.946
I gotta make some headway
on this shed

16:49.014 --> 16:50.747
or it's not gonna get done
before winter.

16:50.815 --> 16:52.683
You should come by
for dinner then.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.918
That sounds great,
but uh...

16:54.987 --> 16:56.587
I'm not sure I'll be done
by then, so...

16:59.290 --> 17:01.724
You know, Lily seems to be doing
really well.

17:01.792 --> 17:04.660
I mean, despite the news
about your dad.

17:04.728 --> 17:06.997
<i>She said something about</i>
<i>talking to a therapist.</i>

17:07.064 --> 17:08.131
A therapist...

17:09.233 --> 17:11.334
Yeah?
What else is new?

17:11.402 --> 17:12.667
Group therapy,
twelve steps,

17:12.736 --> 17:15.404
<i>reiki, acupuncture,</i>
<i>hypnotism.</i>

17:15.472 --> 17:17.606
You name it,
my mom's done it.

17:17.673 --> 17:18.607
At least she's trying,
right?

17:18.674 --> 17:19.907
Yeah, I guess.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.779
Okay.

17:24.847 --> 17:26.848
I should get to work.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.783
Okay.

17:28.851 --> 17:29.784
Thanks for
the fruit basket.

17:29.852 --> 17:30.919
Yeah.

17:34.589 --> 17:37.225
Ty, I'm gonna set you
a place for dinner.

17:39.495 --> 17:42.897
Just in case
you change your mind.

17:48.602 --> 17:49.769
Hey, Amy,

17:49.837 --> 17:51.104
you don't know where Ty is,
do you?

17:51.172 --> 17:52.239
He's not answering
his phone.

17:52.306 --> 17:53.706
Um, he just had to run
into the city,

17:53.774 --> 17:56.676
but he shouldn't be
too much longer.

17:56.744 --> 17:58.412
Okay. Thanks.

17:59.347 --> 18:00.414
Hey, Lily,

18:00.481 --> 18:01.814
um, if you're not
doing anything,

18:01.882 --> 18:05.117
I could use your help
with a horse I'm working with.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.852
How can I
possibly help you?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.421
I don't know anything
about horses.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.621
It doesn't matter,

18:09.689 --> 18:11.524
just as long as you
follow my direction

18:11.591 --> 18:16.328
'cause Alcatraz can be
a little bit unpredictable.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.533
<i>He's really
come</i> <i>a long way.</i>

18:21.600 --> 18:23.268
When I first brought him
to the ranch,

18:23.335 --> 18:25.002
he was so angry.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.871
<i>You know, he even tried</i>
<i>to charge me in the stall.</i>

18:26.939 --> 18:28.306
Oh my God.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.642
Why did he do that?

18:31.710 --> 18:34.645
Well... well, he was abused
by the people who stole him.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.313
All he knows is that
people hurt him,

18:36.381 --> 18:39.550
<i>so he doesn't trust anyone.</i>

18:39.617 --> 18:41.185
I don't blame him.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.023
Whoa.
It's okay.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.293
He just has
to get used to you.

18:50.595 --> 18:51.860
- <i>- Here, you know what?</i>

18:51.928 --> 18:53.229
<i>Why don't you take</i>
<i>a handful of oats...</i>

18:53.297 --> 18:54.763
it's okay...

18:56.100 --> 18:58.167
<i>and just hold it out</i>
<i>to him.</i>

18:58.235 --> 18:59.302
Okay.

19:05.041 --> 19:07.809
Are you sure
I'm the right person for this?

19:07.876 --> 19:09.377
You know what?
Let's try something else.

19:09.445 --> 19:10.812
Why don't you just sprinkle
the oats on the ground

19:10.879 --> 19:12.280
in front of you...

19:13.382 --> 19:14.983
Yeah.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.084
<i>There.</i>

19:18.687 --> 19:21.889
And if he comes to you,
just stand perfectly still,

19:21.957 --> 19:23.157
and he'll learn that
you're not a threat.

19:27.362 --> 19:28.629
So much for that.

19:29.797 --> 19:30.864
I'm not very good
at this.

19:30.932 --> 19:32.566
These things take
some time.

19:32.634 --> 19:35.035
We just started.

19:35.103 --> 19:37.004
- <i>- What do we do next?</i>

19:37.071 --> 19:38.572
Well, we wait.

19:39.507 --> 19:42.375
<i>He'll come over</i>
<i>when he's ready.</i>

19:46.813 --> 19:48.581
Did you bring me
a fruit basket too?

19:48.649 --> 19:50.783
What's that?

19:50.851 --> 19:52.519
Lou was here
earlier.

19:52.586 --> 19:55.087
Can I offer you
a banana or a plum?

19:55.155 --> 19:58.089
No, thanks. I can't stay.
I just uh...

19:58.158 --> 20:00.725
Well, I wanted to stop by
and offer my condolences.

20:00.793 --> 20:03.828
Well, I appreciate that, Jack,
but it's not really necessary.

20:04.897 --> 20:06.097
The only good thing
about having a father

20:06.166 --> 20:08.433
who's always leaving is...

20:08.501 --> 20:11.136
You learn not to waste much time
missing him.

20:11.203 --> 20:14.605
Well, still,
it can't be easy to accept.

20:16.642 --> 20:19.443
That's for the road.
Thanks for stopping by.

20:21.746 --> 20:24.549
Well, I see you're adding on
to that old shed.

20:24.616 --> 20:25.783
Yeah.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.417
Why don't I give you
a hand then.

20:27.485 --> 20:29.553
I thought you said
you had to go?

20:29.620 --> 20:32.088
Well, I got a few minutes.

20:32.156 --> 20:33.890
A project like this
always goes better

20:33.957 --> 20:35.559
with two sets of hands.

20:35.626 --> 20:36.626
Actually, Jack,
this is something

20:36.694 --> 20:38.094
I sorta wanted to do
on my own.

20:38.162 --> 20:39.596
Oh, what's the point of that?

20:39.664 --> 20:41.631
You know, I've built a dozen
sheds in my lifetime,

20:41.699 --> 20:44.700
never did one of 'em
all by myself.

20:55.111 --> 20:57.680
Are you always this patient?

20:57.747 --> 20:59.314
- <i>- I have to be.</i>

20:59.381 --> 21:02.983
Horses are sorta on
their own schedule.

21:03.051 --> 21:04.051
I guess that's
how you've managed

21:04.119 --> 21:07.154
to stay with my son
for so long.

21:08.224 --> 21:10.191
I know from experience.

21:10.259 --> 21:12.694
The bordens aren't exactly
easy to love.

21:14.863 --> 21:17.931
You're good for him,
I can tell.

21:27.908 --> 21:28.975
What should we do?

21:32.846 --> 21:35.248
Grab a handful
of oats...

21:38.452 --> 21:41.053
<i>And walk up to him,</i>
<i>slowly,</i>

21:41.121 --> 21:43.256
<i>with your hand out.</i>

21:52.197 --> 21:55.267
<i>Lily, it's okay.</i>
<i>He's not gonna hurt you.</i>

21:56.935 --> 21:59.137
<i>He's not gonna hurt you.</i>

22:03.075 --> 22:05.409
- Good boy.
- Good boy, Alcatraz.

22:05.477 --> 22:06.510
Good boy.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.817
Hello!

22:13.885 --> 22:14.918
Hey!

22:14.986 --> 22:17.621
I am so sorry I'm late.

22:17.689 --> 22:18.955
Where's Mallory?

22:19.023 --> 22:20.456
She left hours ago.

22:20.524 --> 22:22.759
She said something about
how you take her for granted

22:22.826 --> 22:24.594
and she refuses to work
anymore overtime,

22:24.662 --> 22:26.663
especially if you're not even
gonna call her.

22:26.730 --> 22:28.197
Uh, that was the edited version.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.032
The original had
a little more sarcasm.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.034
And a whole lot
of fast talking.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.569
And don't forget
the door slam.

22:33.637 --> 22:35.771
- Ugh! Okay, I get it.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

22:35.838 --> 22:38.573
It's just been so brutal
at work.

22:38.641 --> 22:39.775
We're trying to woo
this new client

22:39.842 --> 22:41.410
and he's playing hard to get.

22:41.477 --> 22:43.111
And I'm pretty sure
if we don't land this client,

22:43.179 --> 22:44.680
my job is on the line.

22:44.747 --> 22:46.348
But to add insult
to injury,

22:46.416 --> 22:47.849
by the time
I got to the seafood market,

22:47.917 --> 22:48.850
it was closed.

22:48.918 --> 22:50.084
Don't worry.

22:50.152 --> 22:51.385
We've got dinner
completely under control.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.287
Hey, your favorite!
Mac and cheese.

22:53.355 --> 22:54.822
And we didn't have
the boxed kind,

22:54.889 --> 22:56.390
so we made it
from scratch.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.257
I hope that's okay.

22:57.326 --> 22:58.693
Are you kidding me?

22:58.760 --> 23:00.795
Comfort food is exactly
what I need right now.

23:00.862 --> 23:03.897
Just, um, make sure you guys
set a place for Ty.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.399
He said he might be coming by
for dinner.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.801
You saw Ty?

23:06.868 --> 23:09.035
Yeah, I stopped by the trailer
this morning.

23:09.102 --> 23:10.937
He said he was gonna be
at the campus today.

23:11.004 --> 23:12.271
Well, I saw him
this afternoon.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.106
<i>He was still at home</i>
<i>then too.</i>

23:19.880 --> 23:22.615
I thought I was going
to see you at the ranch.

23:22.683 --> 23:23.949
Are you here to give me
another speech?

23:24.016 --> 23:25.250
'Cause I'd rather
you didn't.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.120
Nope. No speeches.

23:31.157 --> 23:33.225
Actually,
I came to give you this,

23:35.228 --> 23:37.396
in case you were hungry.

23:38.898 --> 23:41.632
Mac and cheese
with hot dogs.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.301
<i>I haven't had this</i>
<i>in a while.</i>

23:45.237 --> 23:46.571
Oh,

23:46.638 --> 23:49.273
and even though
it turns my stomach...

23:51.677 --> 23:53.811
Ketchup.
All right.

23:57.415 --> 23:58.982
What's this?

24:00.017 --> 24:01.818
Just some stuff
dad gave me.

24:01.886 --> 24:03.286
Hey...
Oh, sorry.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.520
May I?

24:12.562 --> 24:13.629
Wow...

24:15.031 --> 24:16.131
You kept all this?

24:17.300 --> 24:18.634
It's just a bunch
of old letters.

24:21.036 --> 24:21.969
We were supposed to go
on a road trip

24:22.037 --> 24:24.071
to the grand canyon.

24:24.139 --> 24:27.008
Just another promise
he didn't keep.

24:27.943 --> 24:30.144
Would you have gone?

24:40.488 --> 24:42.188
Eagle lake...
I remember.

24:42.256 --> 24:44.425
Our first big
family trip.

24:44.492 --> 24:46.894
And our last big trip.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.262
I remember thinking
that rock

24:49.330 --> 24:51.431
was the coolest thing
in the world,

24:51.498 --> 24:54.667
and he said
it was priceless.

24:54.735 --> 24:56.769
And I grew up
and found out it was worthless.

24:56.837 --> 24:58.704
Just fool's gold.

24:58.772 --> 25:00.072
Your dad gave you this

25:00.140 --> 25:03.342
so that you would
always remember eagle lake.

25:03.410 --> 25:06.479
So, in a way,
it is kinda priceless.

25:07.481 --> 25:11.150
I think you smiled
the whole time we were there.

25:11.217 --> 25:13.618
Oh... no. No.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.721
Except for when Brad
caught the fish.

25:16.789 --> 25:19.992
You cried.
You cried...

25:20.060 --> 25:22.995
You cried until he agreed
to release it.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.195
Do you remember that?

25:24.263 --> 25:26.164
Yeah, I remember that.

25:27.333 --> 25:30.001
We were a real family
that weekend.

25:30.069 --> 25:31.169
Hey.

25:33.005 --> 25:36.640
Except after that trip,
he left us, mom.

25:37.609 --> 25:38.776
He abandoned
his own fam...

25:43.147 --> 25:44.247
I know.

25:49.854 --> 25:52.755
Believe me,
I haven't forgotten.

25:53.691 --> 25:56.092
But I had to let it go.

25:56.159 --> 25:58.827
I had to forgive him,
Ty,

25:58.895 --> 25:59.895
and I hope
for your own sake

25:59.963 --> 26:03.165
that one day
you can do that too.

26:08.338 --> 26:11.273
Look, I'm gonna spread
your dad's ashes tomorrow,

26:11.341 --> 26:13.108
and I'm gonna do it
with or without you,

26:13.175 --> 26:15.410
but I hope you come.

26:17.046 --> 26:18.713
But in case you don't come,

26:18.780 --> 26:20.115
I want you to know
something.

26:20.182 --> 26:22.450
In his own way,
your dad loved you

26:22.518 --> 26:25.586
more than anyone
in the world.

27:24.130 --> 27:26.064
- <i>- You're leaving.</i>

27:26.132 --> 27:27.966
Yeah.

27:28.033 --> 27:29.201
Gotta run an errand

27:29.268 --> 27:30.435
and then I'm gonna
head on home.

27:30.503 --> 27:32.404
You just got here.

27:32.472 --> 27:33.738
I tried my best with Ty,

27:33.806 --> 27:35.673
I just can't seem
to get through to him.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.608
He's still so angry
at his dad.

27:37.675 --> 27:39.676
Don't give up on him,
please.

27:39.744 --> 27:41.579
I don't think
I'm as patient as you are.

27:41.646 --> 27:43.481
He'll come around.

27:43.548 --> 27:45.716
Just stay
for a little while.

27:45.783 --> 27:47.551
Besides, we've still got
a long way to go with Alcatraz,

27:47.619 --> 27:49.153
and I need your help.

27:49.221 --> 27:50.787
Right...

27:50.855 --> 27:53.056
Like you need my help.

27:53.957 --> 27:55.057
All right.

27:56.193 --> 27:57.293
You win.

28:00.331 --> 28:03.099
Mallory, I am so sorry
about yesterday

28:03.167 --> 28:05.368
and I promise to call
if I'm going to be late again.

28:05.436 --> 28:06.369
I'm over it.

28:06.437 --> 28:07.837
You are?

28:07.904 --> 28:09.071
Just like you're gonna
get over

28:09.139 --> 28:10.872
what I'm about to tell you.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.374
I can't babysit today.

28:12.442 --> 28:13.708
What did you say?

28:13.776 --> 28:14.809
I'm unavailable.

28:14.877 --> 28:16.044
Mallory,
that's not possible.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.446
Look, I have appointments,
I have meetings.

28:17.514 --> 28:18.680
So do I.

28:18.748 --> 28:19.615
I have an optometrist
appointment,

28:19.682 --> 28:21.082
a hair appointment,

28:21.151 --> 28:22.317
and my mom's taking me
for driving lessons...

28:22.385 --> 28:23.585
all the things
I didn't get done

28:23.653 --> 28:24.919
because I was here
waiting for you

28:24.987 --> 28:26.187
to get home from work.

28:26.255 --> 28:27.421
Well, why didn't you
call me earlier?

28:27.489 --> 28:29.056
I mean, you could've
told me this yesterday.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.558
You mean just like
how you could've phoned me

28:30.626 --> 28:32.760
to tell me you were gonna
be late from work?

28:32.827 --> 28:34.362
Mallory, I understand
what you're doing,

28:34.429 --> 28:35.563
I do, I get it,

28:35.631 --> 28:37.465
and like I said,
I'm very sorry,

28:37.533 --> 28:39.367
but you can't do this
to me.

28:39.434 --> 28:40.701
You can't...

28:40.769 --> 28:42.869
Mallory...
Mallory!

28:42.936 --> 28:43.903
You...

28:46.374 --> 28:48.208
I don't believe this.

28:50.944 --> 28:52.646
Okay, okay, okay...

28:56.250 --> 28:57.349
Wow... wow!

28:59.386 --> 29:01.787
Whssst!

29:03.856 --> 29:05.691
Sssst!

29:15.401 --> 29:18.603
Is that it?
Is that the join-up?

29:18.671 --> 29:20.572
Not even close.

29:20.639 --> 29:22.674
He's supposed to come to me,
not walk away.

29:22.741 --> 29:23.908
Well, don't take it so hard.

29:23.975 --> 29:24.842
People have been
walking away from me

29:24.910 --> 29:26.644
my whole life.

29:26.712 --> 29:29.080
Just be glad Alcatraz
didn't leave with your wallet

29:29.147 --> 29:30.614
and your dignity.

29:33.685 --> 29:36.753
So are we gonna do this
join-up thing again?

29:36.821 --> 29:38.888
You know, actually,
I wanna try something else.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.725
Good boy, Alcatraz.

29:41.792 --> 29:44.060
I know,
you're a very good boy.

29:44.128 --> 29:46.895
You're gonna like this bath.

29:46.963 --> 29:48.331
Grab a brush.

29:50.867 --> 29:51.900
Good boy...

29:53.670 --> 29:54.970
<i>That's a good boy.</i>

29:57.608 --> 29:59.875
- Whoa, Alcatraz.
- Whoa...

30:01.544 --> 30:03.211
It's okay...
It's okay.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.812
I know.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.147
Maybe that wasn't
such a good idea.

30:07.816 --> 30:10.917
I don't think
we should use the brushes.

30:10.985 --> 30:12.419
He's really sensitive
on his neck.

30:12.487 --> 30:13.820
After he was stolen,

30:13.888 --> 30:15.589
<i>they injected him</i>
<i>with amphetamines.</i>

30:15.657 --> 30:17.157
Oh my God.

30:17.225 --> 30:19.593
Well, no wonder
he's a basket case.

30:19.661 --> 30:22.696
I'm just gonna try
with my hands.

30:22.764 --> 30:25.798
You're all right.
Good boy.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.067
<i>Good boy.</i>

30:28.135 --> 30:29.769
- There you go...
- Good boy.

30:29.836 --> 30:31.170
I think he'll be okay.

30:31.238 --> 30:32.272
Why don't you come try?

30:32.339 --> 30:33.839
No, I better not.
He might...

30:33.907 --> 30:34.974
He might blow up again.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.609
He won't.

30:36.677 --> 30:38.344
How do you know that?

30:38.412 --> 30:40.812
Well, I don't,
but if he's gonna trust us,

30:40.880 --> 30:42.648
we have to trust him.

30:45.251 --> 30:46.285
<i>Good boy...</i>

30:47.253 --> 30:49.454
<i>Just be nice and gentle.</i>

30:50.390 --> 30:51.456
Okay.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.880
I hope you're not planning
on pitching

32:27.947 --> 32:29.749
Hubbard financial
to me too.

32:29.816 --> 32:32.950
Uh, no, I'm Jack Bartlett.
I own this ranch.

32:33.018 --> 32:35.520
<i>Grandpa, I see
you've met</i> <i>Mr. Walker.</i>

32:35.588 --> 32:38.857
Mr. Walker is a client -
potential client.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.025
I thought it would be
a good idea

32:41.093 --> 32:43.160
to invite him out here
for our meeting.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.530
After all, Hubbard financial
is a family company,

32:45.598 --> 32:49.232
so we treat all our clients
just like family.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.602
When you've got a few
million dollars on the table,

32:51.669 --> 32:54.605
suddenly everybody wants you
to be part of the family.

32:54.672 --> 32:57.073
You know, the last company
that tried to win me over,

32:57.141 --> 32:59.710
they sent me tickets
to the Stanley cup playoffs.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.244
That was awesome.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.447
Awesome,
but not very original.

33:03.515 --> 33:04.514
At Hubbard financial,

33:04.581 --> 33:06.482
we like to think
outside the box.

33:06.550 --> 33:07.817
What, by dragging me
out to the country?

33:07.885 --> 33:09.585
I mean,
seems a little desperate,

33:09.653 --> 33:11.053
if you ask me.

33:11.121 --> 33:13.222
I mean, it is a very nice
piece of real estate.

33:13.290 --> 33:14.557
How old is this place
anyway?

33:14.625 --> 33:16.292
Six generations.

33:16.359 --> 33:17.393
My great grandfather...

33:17.461 --> 33:18.795
dug the well,
built the fireplace,

33:18.862 --> 33:20.429
and I think we're
all caught up now.

33:20.496 --> 33:24.098
Grandpa, did you have
somewhere you needed to be?

33:24.166 --> 33:25.467
What on earth
is that smell?

33:25.535 --> 33:27.402
Oh, just a little something
I threw in the oven.

33:27.470 --> 33:30.038
Nothing like the smell
of fresh baked cinnamon buns.

33:32.642 --> 33:34.976
That doesn't smell
like cinnamon buns to me.

33:35.044 --> 33:36.110
Hey!

33:38.346 --> 33:40.347
I'm so sorry.

33:40.415 --> 33:41.849
Grandpa...
Ahem.

33:41.917 --> 33:45.719
Do you think you could
do me a huge favor?

33:45.787 --> 33:46.954
I would love to, Lou,

33:47.021 --> 33:49.790
but don't I have
somewhere to be?

33:52.693 --> 33:53.993
Okay, then.

33:54.061 --> 33:56.262
Mr. Walker,
we'll be right back.

33:56.330 --> 33:58.230
Just don't move.

34:03.838 --> 34:05.271
Honey,

34:05.339 --> 34:07.740
I am so sorry
you have to spend the day

34:07.808 --> 34:09.608
with mean Mr. Walker.

34:11.243 --> 34:12.610
Mommy didn't get her mba

34:12.679 --> 34:15.112
so she could make
cinnamon buns

34:15.181 --> 34:18.049
for some stuck-up
hotel tycoon.

34:18.117 --> 34:20.118
Oh, I don't like him either.

34:20.186 --> 34:22.621
He's just a big
poo-poo head.

34:23.857 --> 34:25.556
<i>What's that, Katie?</i>

34:25.623 --> 34:28.860
<i>Where can he shove</i>
<i>those cinnamon buns?</i>

34:28.927 --> 34:32.530
<i>He can shove them</i>
<i>where the sun don't shine.</i>

34:32.598 --> 34:35.065
Isn't that right?
Yes, it is.

34:36.167 --> 34:38.369
Oh no.

34:50.447 --> 34:51.614
Perfect.

34:51.681 --> 34:53.884
So, at what point
in our meeting

34:53.951 --> 34:56.784
do you plan shoving those up
where the sun don't shine?

35:01.525 --> 35:04.326
I can't believe
what a good boy he's been.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.929
He's like a completely
different horse.

35:06.997 --> 35:09.598
Well, maybe there's some hope
for Alcatraz after all.

35:09.666 --> 35:11.199
Yeah.

35:11.267 --> 35:13.334
Maybe there is.
Hmm?

35:13.402 --> 35:15.236
I'm gonna go throw him
back in his stall.

35:15.303 --> 35:16.370
Come on, boy.

35:21.276 --> 35:22.877
Hey.

35:22.945 --> 35:24.012
Hi.

35:25.814 --> 35:27.715
Sorry, I didn't
come earlier.

35:27.783 --> 35:29.650
Well, you're here now.

35:33.688 --> 35:35.255
I've been thinking about
eagle lake,

35:35.322 --> 35:36.990
and uh...

35:37.058 --> 35:38.959
I wish there were more weekends
like that.

35:41.395 --> 35:42.663
So do I.

35:44.398 --> 35:46.198
I'd like to, uh,
help spread dad's ashes,

35:46.266 --> 35:48.500
if I'm not too late.

35:50.470 --> 35:52.504
It's not too late.

35:58.158 --> 35:59.491
<i>Stupid! Stupid!</i>

36:04.363 --> 36:05.497
Aghhh! Stupid!

36:08.567 --> 36:09.967
<i>Well, I don't have to tell
you</i> <i>the biggest rule of them.</i>

36:10.035 --> 36:12.437
<i>Always match the hatch.</i>

36:12.505 --> 36:13.605
- <i>- You got that right.</i>

36:15.640 --> 36:17.808
Well, they're...
Pretty simple really,

36:17.875 --> 36:19.943
but they sure do
the trick.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.612
Oh, that is some
nice work, Jack.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.746
Yeah...

36:23.815 --> 36:25.816
Hi, Lou.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.150
Just showing Jim here
some of the flies

36:27.218 --> 36:29.052
I've been using
this season.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.087
Turns out
he's a real fishing buff.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.156
<i>You know,</i>
<i>there's a stretch of river</i>

36:33.224 --> 36:34.357
not too far from here

36:34.425 --> 36:35.826
that has never
let me down.

36:35.893 --> 36:36.860
It's too bad
you're leaving.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.093
Otherwise,
I'd say...

36:38.161 --> 36:39.661
<i>Let's head out</i>
<i>and drop a line.</i>

36:39.729 --> 36:41.363
- <i>- Really?</i>

36:41.431 --> 36:42.965
-  <i>Sure.
- I got some gear</i> <i>you can use.</i>

36:43.033 --> 36:44.700
All right,
you're on.

36:44.767 --> 36:45.968
Okay!

36:53.643 --> 36:57.511
So I guess he rides
shotgun with you?

36:57.579 --> 36:58.612
Maybe, just for now,

36:58.680 --> 37:00.581
you can leave him
in the trunk.

37:00.649 --> 37:01.716
Done.

37:09.424 --> 37:12.492
This was a really weird
conversation.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.900
Do you have a place
in mind?

37:19.968 --> 37:21.301
Uh, yeah.

37:23.137 --> 37:24.938
There's a mountain creek
not far from here,

37:25.006 --> 37:27.539
and it's pretty nice
this time of year, so...

37:27.607 --> 37:28.574
That sounds perfect.

37:28.641 --> 37:30.776
Yeah.

37:30.844 --> 37:32.345
When's the last time

37:32.412 --> 37:35.714
the three of us were all in
the same car together?

37:37.351 --> 37:38.351
Do you know that we drove
all the way here

37:38.418 --> 37:39.385
and we didn't argue once!

37:39.452 --> 37:40.552
Mom!

37:40.620 --> 37:42.387
What? Too soon?

37:44.590 --> 37:46.691
<i>So what do you say?</i>

37:46.759 --> 37:49.494
One last family
road trip?

37:51.530 --> 37:52.931
All right.

37:56.702 --> 37:57.968
Hold that thought,
I'm gonna be right back.

37:58.036 --> 37:58.969
Okay.

37:59.037 --> 38:00.737
Forgot my phone.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.094
Thank goodness.

38:25.162 --> 38:26.963
I'm always forgetting
where I leave that darn thing.

38:27.031 --> 38:29.498
Why is Wade calling you?

38:30.433 --> 38:32.367
Are you back with him?

38:32.435 --> 38:33.335
Okay, Ty...

38:33.403 --> 38:34.803
Yes or no?!

38:36.806 --> 38:38.173
Yes.
Yes.

38:38.241 --> 38:39.841
I was gonna tell you
sooner,

38:39.909 --> 38:41.643
and then your dad
passed away.

38:41.710 --> 38:42.877
How long?

38:43.779 --> 38:45.047
A month.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.647
He called me
out of the blue,

38:46.714 --> 38:47.848
and he told me

38:47.916 --> 38:49.317
he tried to help you
with your tuition.

38:49.384 --> 38:50.617
The only person Wade
is trying to help is himself.

38:50.685 --> 38:52.753
No, no.
He's not like that anymore.

38:52.821 --> 38:56.090
Yes, he is!
He's exactly the same!

38:56.158 --> 38:58.359
And you and me,
we're exactly the same.

38:58.427 --> 38:59.893
We keep having
this conversation

38:59.962 --> 39:01.662
over and over again.

39:01.729 --> 39:02.829
I had to forgive him,
Ty,

39:02.896 --> 39:04.630
just like I had
to forgive your dad.

39:04.698 --> 39:08.068
That's not forgiveness!
That is insanity!

39:09.036 --> 39:10.470
You can go to all
the shrinks you want,

39:10.537 --> 39:11.871
but you're still as messed up
as you always were.

39:11.939 --> 39:13.139
No, I'm not.

39:13.207 --> 39:14.474
I'm coming at this
from a different angle.

39:14.541 --> 39:15.741
Shut up!

39:16.777 --> 39:18.577
Shut up, okay?!

39:20.680 --> 39:24.316
I'm trying to move forward
with my life.

39:24.384 --> 39:28.720
You're not moving forward,
you're moving backwards.

39:40.894 --> 39:43.028
<i>Uh, I packed you
up</i> <i>some sandwiches,</i>

39:43.096 --> 39:45.998
so you should be
good to go.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.201
You know, um...

39:48.268 --> 39:49.502
I hope you don't think

39:49.570 --> 39:50.670
that just because
I'm going fishing with Jack

39:50.737 --> 39:52.404
that you sold me
on your company.

39:52.471 --> 39:53.638
No, I don't.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.873
And to be honest,

39:55.941 --> 39:57.275
the only reason I asked you
to come here today

39:57.343 --> 40:01.012
was because my babysitter
left me high and dry.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.682
But that doesn't matter now,
Mr. Walker.

40:03.749 --> 40:06.718
What matters is that my team
has gone through your books

40:06.785 --> 40:08.086
and we've discovered
the potential

40:08.153 --> 40:10.354
for seven figure
tax savings.

40:10.422 --> 40:12.590
Yes, I need your business,
Mr. Walker,

40:12.657 --> 40:15.693
but frankly,
you need me more.

40:15.760 --> 40:16.860
So when you get back,

40:16.928 --> 40:20.564
what do you say
we sit down and talk?

40:21.499 --> 40:24.167
You know, um...

40:24.235 --> 40:26.536
I've been called many things
over the years,

40:26.604 --> 40:29.239
but never a poo-poo head.

40:29.306 --> 40:31.207
I was out of line.

40:32.109 --> 40:34.244
Well, we'll see.

40:34.311 --> 40:36.579
You know if the fish
are still biting,

40:36.647 --> 40:38.180
I just might be
in a good mood

40:38.249 --> 40:39.315
when I come back.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.421
Did you try talking to her?

40:46.489 --> 40:48.757
She made her choice.

40:48.824 --> 40:50.459
I can't protect my mom
forever.

40:53.162 --> 40:54.996
What if she's right
about Wade?

40:55.064 --> 40:57.565
What if he has changed?

40:58.667 --> 41:00.534
Just playing
devil's advocate here.

41:00.602 --> 41:02.703
He did help us
when cisco was stolen.

41:02.771 --> 41:04.071
If it wasn't for him,

41:04.139 --> 41:07.275
my dad's horse could have
ended up like Alcatraz.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.542
That's gotta count
for something.

41:08.610 --> 41:09.877
The only reason
Wade helped us

41:09.944 --> 41:11.312
was to get to my mom,

41:11.380 --> 41:13.313
and that's exactly
what he got.

41:15.983 --> 41:19.386
Are you at least
gonna say goodbye?

41:26.694 --> 41:28.427
Hey, Alcatraz.

41:29.763 --> 41:30.696
I'm leaving now.

41:30.764 --> 41:32.898
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

41:38.638 --> 41:41.540
One step forward
and two steps back, huh?

41:41.608 --> 41:44.409
Yeah. There's a lot of that
going around lately.

41:44.476 --> 41:45.943
Just when you think
you made some progress,

41:46.011 --> 41:48.879
you end up right back
where you started.

41:51.950 --> 41:55.687
Do you think that horse
can really change?

41:55.754 --> 41:57.789
- <i>- I don't know.</i>

41:58.791 --> 42:02.225
Do you wanna help me
try something?

42:04.762 --> 42:07.030
<i>All right,</i>
<i>you gotta keep him moving.</i>

42:07.097 --> 42:10.033
<i>Keep him moving.</i>

42:10.100 --> 42:11.601
<i>Nicely done.</i>

42:11.669 --> 42:12.836
There you go.

42:12.903 --> 42:13.870
<i>Good job.</i>

42:16.406 --> 42:20.343
<i>Now, when you're ready,</i>
<i>take the pressure off.</i>

42:20.410 --> 42:21.910
<i>Now turn in.</i>

42:41.731 --> 42:43.598
Good boy, Alcatraz.

42:46.068 --> 42:48.135
You're a good boy.

43:19.599 --> 43:22.501
Please don't go
back to him.

43:42.421 --> 43:46.756
I hope you can find
a peaceful place for him.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.304
Eagle lake.
