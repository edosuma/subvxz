MAC DAVIS:
Back a few months ago,

00:09.677 --> 00:12.280
I was headlinin'
a great big nightclub,

00:14.782 --> 00:17.051
and they put me up
a couple days early.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.852
I came in a couple days early,

00:18.886 --> 00:20.888
and they put me up in what
they call the "Star Suite."

00:22.423 --> 00:23.991
Now here I am,

00:24.024 --> 00:26.194
headlinin' in one
of the biggest nightclubs

00:26.227 --> 00:27.428
in the country,

00:27.461 --> 00:28.662
and I wake up
at 8:00 in the morning

00:28.696 --> 00:30.064
in this "Star Suite"

00:31.432 --> 00:32.866
all by myself.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.335
AUDIENCE: Aw!

00:34.368 --> 00:37.238
DAVIS: Yeah,
that's what I said, "Aw."

00:37.271 --> 00:39.073
But I did
what I've always done, man,

00:39.107 --> 00:40.174
to cheer myself up,

00:40.208 --> 00:41.609
I picked up my guitar,

00:41.642 --> 00:43.944
I sat down,
and I wrote me a little song.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.614
Now this is how it feels

00:46.647 --> 00:48.282
to be alone
at the top of the hill,

00:48.316 --> 00:49.883
tryin' to figure out why.

00:51.319 --> 00:56.190
* Oh, Lord, it's hard
to be humble *

00:56.224 --> 01:00.128
* When you're perfect
in every way *

01:00.161 --> 01:04.598
* I can't wait to look
in the mirror *

01:04.632 --> 01:07.901

01:09.002 --> 01:12.140

01:13.841 --> 01:16.277

* Oh, Lord, it's hard
to be humble *

01:22.250 --> 01:25.419
* But I'm doin' the best
that I can *

01:26.420 --> 01:28.256
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:31.292 --> 01:35.296
* I used to have
a girlfriend *

01:35.329 --> 01:39.667
* But I guess she just
couldn't compete *

01:39.700 --> 01:43.637
* With all these
love-starved women *

01:43.671 --> 01:48.008
* Who keep clamoring
at my feet *

01:48.041 --> 01:52.613
* Well, I prob'ly could
find me another *

01:52.646 --> 01:56.850
* But I guess they're all
in awe of me *

01:56.884 --> 02:01.021
* Who cares
I never get lonesome *

02:01.054 --> 02:04.225

03:07.255 --> 03:08.622
Don't stop! Oh, Emmit!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.731
On the sofa, I thought,

03:17.765 --> 03:20.534
unless you're attached to
a more classic bed narrative.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.736
Non-descript, though,
you know, the furnishings,

03:22.770 --> 03:24.004
so they can't tie it to us.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.540
That's...
I think you solved it.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.877
We can keep you in a shirt,
hiding your difference.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.879
Maybe in a cowgirl,
or a doggy scenario,

03:31.912 --> 03:33.781
favoring our rears,
in other words,

03:33.814 --> 03:35.583
keeping our faces
slightly absurd.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.918
"Obscured."

03:37.951 --> 03:39.320
What did I say?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.189
I'm glad we're
doing this, babe.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.691
Taking control.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.093
This whole time,
we've been playing to draw.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.561
It's time
we start playing to win.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.130
I know, but blackmail...

03:50.163 --> 03:52.933
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip. Gone.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.068
I know, and I'm so sorry.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.237
It's not your fault.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.939
A day like you had,

03:58.972 --> 04:00.608
I would have stopped
for a sidecar, too.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.042
I just lost track...

04:02.075 --> 04:03.644
I know.

04:03.677 --> 04:07.080
This thing with your brother
has got us both upset.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.950
To deprive
a man of his career,

04:09.983 --> 04:11.319
endanger his female...

04:11.352 --> 04:13.053
I panicked.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.755
You're too hard on yourself.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.124
You rallied,
didn't you, in the end?

04:18.359 --> 04:20.428
You're here. We're together.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.230
Maybe I can call the guy,
the high roller,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.632
-and say...
-What? Really?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.133
'Cause you lost your job
at the parole board

04:26.166 --> 04:27.935

banging your clients?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.971
No, because I fell in love.

04:36.644 --> 04:40.548
That's sweet. You're sweet.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.109
I just love you so much.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.645
No. For Pete's sake,
I'm wearing a hooker wig!

05:11.679 --> 05:13.481
-Just hold on.
-Sorry.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.517
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.

05:18.018 --> 05:21.188
Okay. Now, go.

05:21.221 --> 05:25.393
Babe, you're my everything.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.660
I want we should spend

05:26.694 --> 05:28.061

will you marry me?

Which part of what I just said
is giving you trouble?

08:41.555 --> 08:43.223
This is my office.

08:45.125 --> 08:49.697
A fat woman is
inherently untrustworthy

08:49.730 --> 08:54.267
as she is a sensualist
who sees no real difference

08:54.301 --> 08:59.172
between a pastrami sandwich
and a dick in the mouth.

08:59.206 --> 09:03.777
There's no call for
that kind of language.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.046
No.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.849
A female Jew is
especially vulnerable

09:08.882 --> 09:13.220

of the forbidden,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.088

-What?
-A chicken.

09:32.439 --> 09:36.076
Do you know what a chicken is?

09:36.109 --> 09:41.414
A chicken is an egg's way
of making another egg.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.194
You see, it's all
a matter of perspective.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.731

You may have,
during the course of the day,

11:49.209 --> 11:52.179
a strong impulse to act.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.948

15:27.027 --> 15:29.262
My husband made his first
million in mortuaries.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.497
SY: Hmm.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.799
"Everybody dies, Ruby,"
he told me,

15:32.832 --> 15:34.767
"You can't just
leave them on the sofa."

15:34.801 --> 15:36.236
(SY LAUGHS)

15:36.269 --> 15:38.105
One night, he was eating
a three-pound lobster

15:38.138 --> 15:41.508
and he had a stroke,
and with it, a revelation.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.444
Self-storage,
that was the future.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.114
The two businesses
are surprisingly similar

15:47.147 --> 15:48.648
when you think about it,

15:48.681 --> 15:51.551
a place to put the things
you'll never use again.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.754
He died last year.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.924
Complications from polio.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.661
For six months, I wore black
and tore my sleeves.

16:01.694 --> 16:05.465
And then,
I had a revelation of my own.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.534
Parking lots.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.303
The final piece to
the storage triptych.

16:10.337 --> 16:14.174
People are always going
to need a place to park.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.308
Amen.

16:17.510 --> 16:21.014
I'll be honest with you,
Mr. Feltz.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.817
At my age, I'm not
looking for a partner.

16:24.851 --> 16:28.121
My preference
would be to acquire

16:28.155 --> 16:31.291
the entire company,
Stussy Lots Ltd.,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.327
and I would be happy
to let you keep

16:34.361 --> 16:37.897
the name intact
if that worries you.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.201
A second choice would be

16:41.234 --> 16:44.404
to buy several
lots independently

16:44.437 --> 16:47.507
and build
the business that way,

16:47.540 --> 16:50.410
but let's be honest.

16:50.443 --> 16:54.681
That would make me
your competitor,

16:56.683 --> 17:01.354
and, as my late
husband always used to say,

17:01.388 --> 17:07.094
"You don't want
a Goldfarb for an enemy."

17:07.127 --> 17:09.062
-I'm sure that's true.
-Mmm.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.734
It's interesting that you
should come to us now.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.203
Problems?

17:16.236 --> 17:18.205
No, not problems.

17:18.238 --> 17:22.008
More of a softening
of the will.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.278
You see, Emmit Stussy,
whom you'll meet,

17:25.312 --> 17:27.414
is a great man,

17:27.447 --> 17:30.049
a philanthropist, a leader,

17:30.083 --> 17:31.551
and, of late,

17:31.584 --> 17:33.220
he's been talking
with increased regularity

17:33.253 --> 17:35.188
about dedicating
himself in total

17:35.222 --> 17:36.589
to his good works,

17:36.623 --> 17:40.693
i.e.,
the betterment of mankind.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.395
Now, I suggested
he take a step back

17:42.429 --> 17:44.063
and allow me to
run the day-to-day,

17:44.097 --> 17:46.533
but he seems adamant
that we stick together.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.568
Pre-schools in Mumbai,

17:48.601 --> 17:51.438
health clinics
in Inner Mongolia,

17:51.471 --> 17:54.274
better access to
veterinary care.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.542
And after all,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.110
how much money
does one man need?

17:57.144 --> 18:00.913
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.984
And you'd be okay with that,

18:05.017 --> 18:07.887
selling a business that you
worked so hard to build?

42:54.272 --> 42:56.742
You made a withdrawal
in the amount

42:56.775 --> 42:59.210
of $10,000 cash
earlier this week.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.712
-(WHISPERS) Motherfucker.
-Excuse me?

43:00.746 --> 43:02.447
-What?
-You said?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.282
Since when was it
a crime for a citizen,

43:04.315 --> 43:07.385
a tax paying citizen to use
their own money? (LAUGHS)

43:07.418 --> 43:10.055
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.990
But, uh, any transaction,

43:12.023 --> 43:17.062
deposit or withdrawal
greater than $9,999.99,

43:17.095 --> 43:18.496
it triggers an alarm with us.

43:18.529 --> 43:19.931
An alarm?

43:19.965 --> 43:22.100
Not an actual alarm

43:22.133 --> 43:24.169
like at a fire station,
that would be funny.

43:24.202 --> 43:25.971
Spinning light,
maybe get a pole.

43:26.004 --> 43:28.807
No, it's more of an alert,
a computer alert.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.644
So, I've been dispatched by HQ
to ask a few questions.

43:32.678 --> 43:34.112
They're simple questions.

43:34.145 --> 43:35.513
Maybe take a look
at your books.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.816
My books?

43:38.717 --> 43:40.285
Think of it like...

43:41.820 --> 43:43.221
You been to the airport?

43:46.291 --> 43:47.926
Recently?

43:47.959 --> 43:50.662
In life, I'm saying
you've been to an airport?

43:50.696 --> 43:51.830
Yes.

43:51.863 --> 43:53.164
Well, sometimes
at the airport,

43:53.198 --> 43:54.833
when you go
through the detector,

43:54.866 --> 43:58.469
the metal detector,
or the radiographic scan,

43:58.503 --> 44:00.005
you get selected
for additional screening,

44:00.038 --> 44:01.539
a pat down.

44:01.572 --> 44:04.009
Maybe they swab your hands
for explosives residue.

44:04.042 --> 44:05.777
-What?
-Residue.

44:05.811 --> 44:07.312
To make sure you haven't been,
you know, building a bomb.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.814
What are we
talking about here?

44:08.847 --> 44:10.648
Nobody's been building any...

44:10.682 --> 44:13.484
No, of course not. (CHUCKLES)
That's what I'm saying.

44:13.518 --> 44:15.453
But because
of your withdrawal,

44:15.486 --> 44:17.222
which I am required
by law to question,

44:17.255 --> 44:19.624
you've been selected
for additional review.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.994
Screening, minimally invasive,
day surgery,

44:23.028 --> 44:26.097
versus, say,
having your colon removed.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.399
Little IRS humor.

44:28.433 --> 44:29.500
Isn't this... Uh...

44:31.536 --> 44:33.304
Don't you need
a warrant for this?

44:33.338 --> 44:35.173
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.042
Uh, this is more
of an informal

44:37.075 --> 44:38.810

44:38.844 --> 44:40.311
so that we can
avert an actual audit.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.980
An audit?

44:42.013 --> 44:43.815
Are you crazy?

44:43.849 --> 44:44.883

44:44.916 --> 44:47.018

44:47.052 --> 44:48.653
-I'm sorry.
-Sure.

44:48.686 --> 44:53.324
Our records are pristine,
our books.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.326

44:55.360 --> 44:57.395

44:59.130 --> 45:01.532
And that other gentleman
in the next office,

45:01.566 --> 45:02.968
that would be Mr., uh...

45:08.606 --> 45:09.640
Feltz?

45:10.742 --> 45:12.610
It might be.

45:12.643 --> 45:14.412
Sir?

45:17.082 --> 45:21.586
No. Uh, Mr. Feltz
is off today.

45:21.619 --> 45:23.855

45:23.889 --> 45:25.290
Oh, I see.

45:25.323 --> 45:27.558

to talk to him as well,

45:27.592 --> 45:30.428

of your staff.

this is just a baby step.

45:39.270 --> 45:41.272

45:41.306 --> 45:43.641

45:43.674 --> 45:45.110
maybe look over your books.

45:45.143 --> 45:46.244

45:46.277 --> 45:47.645
Exactly.
