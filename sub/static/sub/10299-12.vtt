01:14.868 --> 01:16.099
All the other parents

01:16.133 --> 01:17.834
are throwing a party
for my soccer team.

01:17.868 --> 01:19.900
All my friends are
having a graduation party.

01:19.934 --> 01:22.433
I deserve it. I graduated.
My soccer team says you suck.

01:22.467 --> 01:24.433
I want a party, now!
I want a party too!

01:24.467 --> 01:28.234
Money, money,
money, money, money!

01:28.767 --> 01:31.934
Mom, Daddy's
gone away again.

01:31.968 --> 01:36.400
Ah, he's just visiting
his retirement property.

01:36.434 --> 01:38.867
Well, how are we supposed
to know? He's always a veg.

01:38.901 --> 01:40.033
It's just as well.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.468
I'm sick of lookin'
at him anyway.

01:50.167 --> 01:52.633
Oh!

01:52.667 --> 01:55.368
Oh, Peg, not you.

01:56.334 --> 01:57.867
I was in a hammock,

01:57.901 --> 02:01.533
mourning the anniversary
of your passing.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.200
Where were we,
Daddy?

02:03.234 --> 02:04.966
See, kids,
it was a dream.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.800
You were replaced
by two six-packs

02:06.834 --> 02:08.934
in the refrigerator.

02:10.701 --> 02:13.166
Well,
weren't we cold?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.368
I was.
You were empty.

02:17.234 --> 02:18.600
Oh, Al,

02:18.634 --> 02:21.166
it's gonna take you 20 years
to pay off that property.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.066
And once it's paid off, I'm
never gonna let you go there.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.300
Come on, honey,

02:25.334 --> 02:27.400
take this "How well do
you know your mate?" quiz.

02:27.434 --> 02:28.700
No,
I hate those tests.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.266
They're designed
to bury men.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.533
I'm not playing.

02:32.567 --> 02:33.767
Question one.

02:33.801 --> 02:36.266
Okay, you have to close
your eyes for this one.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.301
What color is my hair?

02:41.501 --> 02:43.001
Red.

02:43.901 --> 02:45.500
Well, good!

02:46.767 --> 02:47.934
Question two:

02:47.968 --> 02:49.966
"Who would you rather
spend the night with?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.800
A, your wife,
or B-- "

02:51.834 --> 02:53.500
B.

03:00.067 --> 03:03.133
Peggy,
I need some advice.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.468
Can we have
some privacy?

03:09.367 --> 03:11.533
Open up, babe.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.099
Tell us
what you got.

03:14.133 --> 03:15.800
We're here for you.

03:16.634 --> 03:20.400
Well...I went to
a banking seminar this weekend.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.999
And I guess
the whole world knows

03:22.033 --> 03:25.033
no one parties
like a banker.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.733
Anyway, all I know is,

03:27.767 --> 03:30.567
I woke up this morning
with a man in my bed.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.200
I don't even know
who he is!

03:32.234 --> 03:33.800
Well, that's easy.
He slept with you.

03:33.834 --> 03:36.167
He's the stupidest man
on Earth.

03:39.534 --> 03:41.700
Al, we're talking
about sex.

03:41.734 --> 03:45.401
Leave it to those
who do it.

03:46.234 --> 03:47.867
Now, Marcie,
this is serious.

03:47.901 --> 03:50.966
I want you to steady yourself
and concentrate.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.300
Was he any good?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.867
I don't know.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.433
I don't even know
what he looks like.

03:56.467 --> 03:59.167
All right!

03:59.801 --> 04:01.033
Well,
when I woke up,

04:01.067 --> 04:02.667
his head was buried
in the pillow.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.467
But I do know one thing:

04:05.501 --> 04:07.966
Apparently,
I married him.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.133
You got married?

04:09.167 --> 04:10.266
Oh, let's not panic.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.200
If you married
everybody you slept with,

04:12.234 --> 04:15.633
you'd be Mrs. Paperboy,
Mrs. Insurance Man, Mrs. Navy.

04:18.334 --> 04:20.934
No, idiot.
Ireallymarried him.

04:20.968 --> 04:22.233
Look at this ring.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.266
And then there's this:

04:24.300 --> 04:28.166
"I went to Clyde's No Blood Test
Needed Wedding Chapel

04:28.200 --> 04:32.401
And all I got was
this lousy T-shirt."

04:32.901 --> 04:36.633
Oh, God,
it's my husband!

04:36.667 --> 04:37.834
Don't tell him
I'm here.

04:37.868 --> 04:40.800
She's here!
Come on in!

04:51.133 --> 04:53.900
I- I saw a woman
come over here.

04:53.934 --> 04:56.234
Are-- ? Are one of you
my wife?

05:04.367 --> 05:06.966
All right!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.267
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go back to bed.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.001
Bye, Daddy.

05:12.701 --> 05:13.700
No, no, no, no.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.700
You've made a mistake.

05:15.734 --> 05:17.999
I'm your wife!

05:18.033 --> 05:20.567
Now we can go
back to bed.

05:20.601 --> 05:22.500
Oh, shut up.

05:22.534 --> 05:24.867
It's me! It's me!

05:24.901 --> 05:25.934
You?

05:25.968 --> 05:28.767
Oh, yeah!
I remember you now.

05:28.801 --> 05:30.200
You were the one on top

05:30.234 --> 05:33.166
of the all-girl
banker pyramid.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.366
By the way,
my name is Jefferson.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.966
I'm Marcie.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.300
Yeah, I'm Al.

05:38.334 --> 05:40.433
So now that the Beatles
have been reunited,

05:40.467 --> 05:42.834
you can get the hell
out of here.

05:42.868 --> 05:44.767
You know, despite
our rocky beginning,

05:44.801 --> 05:47.500
I've got a really good feeling
about our marriage.

05:47.534 --> 05:49.567
What'd you say
your name was again?

05:54.501 --> 05:56.800
Peggy,
can I talk to you?

05:56.834 --> 05:59.001
Bud,
come here.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.099
We have enough
information

06:02.133 --> 06:04.433
to tell the neighbors now,
don't we?

06:04.467 --> 06:06.800
Tosellthe neighbors.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.600
Do you do nothing
for free?

06:12.067 --> 06:13.867
Peggy, I'm worried.

06:13.901 --> 06:17.133
I don't know
my husband.

06:17.167 --> 06:20.467
Who does,
and who wants to?

06:20.501 --> 06:21.667
Face it, Marcie,

06:21.701 --> 06:23.633
the average
man-woman relationship

06:23.667 --> 06:26.233
has, tops, three weeks
of happiness.

06:26.267 --> 06:28.166
You know,
it's the happiness you feel

06:28.200 --> 06:30.266
when he still turns
away from you to burp,

06:30.300 --> 06:32.333
rather than turning
towards you and saying,

06:32.367 --> 06:34.401
"Pull my finger."

06:35.901 --> 06:40.166
It's when he at least tries
to hit the toilet.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.533
And when during sex,
you're not lying there thinking,

06:43.567 --> 06:46.166
"What the hell
is he doing?"

06:46.200 --> 06:47.667
You know, you're lucky.

06:47.701 --> 06:50.700
Your three weeks of happiness
are ahead of you.

06:50.734 --> 06:52.567
Who cares who he is?

06:52.601 --> 06:55.099
Look at him.
He's gorgeous.

06:55.133 --> 06:58.099
I say, saddle up, ride.

06:58.133 --> 07:01.667
And if he breaks a leg,
shoot him.

07:01.701 --> 07:03.733
Now, Jeff,
all kidding aside...

07:03.767 --> 07:05.934
run.

07:05.968 --> 07:10.133
Run hard, run now,
run silent, run deep.

07:10.167 --> 07:13.166
Run like Mexican water
through a first-time tourist,

07:13.200 --> 07:17.133
but the key word here
is"run."

07:17.167 --> 07:19.999
Don't you think
she's cute, Al?

07:20.033 --> 07:22.733
Run.

07:22.767 --> 07:26.200
It's just that I can hardly
believe I'm now Mrs...

07:26.234 --> 07:28.300
Darling?

07:28.334 --> 07:29.867
What's your last name?

07:29.901 --> 07:32.134
D'Arcy.

07:39.801 --> 07:42.834
Marcie D'Arcy?

07:42.868 --> 07:46.166
I'm now Marcie D'Arcy?
What have I done?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.667
Maybe I should
start wearing

07:47.701 --> 07:50.700
little dresses
with dots on them.

07:50.734 --> 07:53.099
Oh, what's the matter, Marcie?

07:53.133 --> 07:55.099
Well,
aside from the fact

07:55.133 --> 07:58.567
that I now have the name
of a cartoon character,

07:58.601 --> 08:01.600
I'm married and I don't
even remember the wedding.

08:01.634 --> 08:04.834
You remember this,
don't you?

08:12.167 --> 08:13.999
Oh, Al.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.767
Mmm.

08:19.901 --> 08:21.867
Oh, Al!

08:22.501 --> 08:24.934
Oh, Al!

08:24.968 --> 08:26.433
Oh, please.
They're two drunks

08:26.467 --> 08:28.966
who haven't brushed
their teeth yet.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.066
Cut that out you two.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.232
We don't do that
in our house.

08:33.267 --> 08:34.600
I refuse to let strangers

08:34.634 --> 08:37.533
lay their vile customs
at our doorstep.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.667
And the Yankees
take the field.

08:41.701 --> 08:43.767
You know what
I was just thinking?

08:43.801 --> 08:46.266
That hangovers
do come true?

08:46.300 --> 08:47.867
No, actually, I was thinking

08:47.901 --> 08:50.366
if you wanna have a wedding
to remember, let's have one.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.667
Let's have the grandest wedding
we can afford.

08:52.701 --> 08:54.033
Yes, let's!

08:54.067 --> 08:55.767
I have $2,000 saved.

08:55.801 --> 09:00.066
Okay. And, uh, let's see, that
brings us to a total of, uh...

09:00.100 --> 09:02.900
$2,040.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.333
We can book a hall.

09:24.367 --> 09:25.934
Oh, no.
You can't book a hall.

09:25.968 --> 09:28.099
I won't hear of that.
How impersonal.

09:28.133 --> 09:30.867
You'll have your wedding
in God's cathedral:

09:30.901 --> 09:32.667
our backyard.

09:32.701 --> 09:36.333
Your backyard
is Buck's toilet.

09:36.367 --> 09:40.966
No,yourbackyard
is Buck's toilet.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.066
Now, what do you say?

09:42.100 --> 09:43.834
I don't know.

09:43.868 --> 09:45.300
Do you think
we can trust them?

09:45.334 --> 09:47.567
Of course.
They look...

09:50.968 --> 09:54.033
Perfectly trustworthy to me,
and besides,

09:54.067 --> 09:56.600
it's a closer trip
to the honeymoon suite.

09:56.634 --> 09:58.468
Come on,
let's pace it off now.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.600
Two thousand dollars
buys a lot of dreams, eh, babe?

10:11.968 --> 10:14.834
<i>Oil you up again, ma'am?</i>

10:14.868 --> 10:17.233
<i>I'm sorry your husband
fell into that volcano</i>

10:17.267 --> 10:20.500
<i>so he couldn't enjoy Hawaii.</i>

10:25.434 --> 10:28.600
<i>They sure are a-bitin',
eh, Mr. Bundy?</i>

10:28.634 --> 10:32.700
<i>Too bad the wife
did a header into that quarry.</i>

10:32.734 --> 10:36.567
<i>She sure would have loved
your retirement property.</i>

10:38.234 --> 10:40.033
Oh, Al.

10:40.067 --> 10:42.734
Oh, Peg.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.400
Yeah, I want to cater
a wedding.

10:48.434 --> 10:50.233
Um, I'm expecting
about 60 people,

10:50.267 --> 10:53.733
so I'll need about
two pounds of cold cuts.

10:53.767 --> 10:56.467
Yeah,
what's your cheapest price?

10:56.501 --> 10:58.934
Uh-huh.

10:58.968 --> 11:03.400
And what kind of animal
would that be?

11:03.434 --> 11:06.800
Well, at 12 cents a pound,
it's pretty steep.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.368
Anyway, could you throw
in some beaks and claws?

11:10.701 --> 11:12.834
You got a deal.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.066
Hi, Al.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.033
Did you know there's
a little rain cloud

11:21.067 --> 11:23.133
that only hangs
over your house?

11:23.167 --> 11:27.166
Yeah, it showed up
after the kids were born.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.400
What can I do for you?

11:28.434 --> 11:31.999
Listen, Al, if Marcie should
come by asking for me,

11:32.033 --> 11:34.166
would you tell her I went out
to buy her a gift, okay?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.767
You're running, huh?

11:35.801 --> 11:38.834
It's never quite the same
when you're sober, is it?

11:38.868 --> 11:40.999
No, that's not it, Al.
You see,

11:41.033 --> 11:44.600
I just haven't found a way yet
to tell Marcie that...

11:44.634 --> 11:47.401
Well, I have to see
my parole officer.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.867
You mean, like,

11:50.901 --> 11:52.966
"If there's only a bucket
of beaks at the wedding,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.567
you'll go crazy
and start slashing"

11:54.601 --> 11:55.966
kind of parole officer?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.900
No, I don't want you
to get the wrong idea, Al.

11:57.934 --> 11:58.934
I'm not a bad guy,
okay?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.767
I... I just, uh...

12:00.801 --> 12:02.633
You know...

12:02.667 --> 12:05.266
I stole a bunch of money
from people who trusted me.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.900
That's all.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.066
You're not gonna tell
anybody, are you, Al?

12:10.100 --> 12:12.166
It's not something
I'm real proud of.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.500
Especially since
I got caught.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.233
Well...

12:16.267 --> 12:17.700
Jeff,
I'll tell you something.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.767
Telling Al Bundy
is just like telling the wind.

12:19.801 --> 12:21.467
Well, thanks, Al.
I appreciate it.

12:21.501 --> 12:22.667
That's all right.
See ya.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.301
Go ahead.
Take care.

12:25.868 --> 12:26.900
Peg!

12:26.934 --> 12:28.533
Peg!

12:30.667 --> 12:33.834
* I know a secret *

12:33.868 --> 12:35.533
What? What?

12:35.567 --> 12:37.567
Guess who's been
mighty careful

12:37.601 --> 12:39.467
not to drop anything
in the shower

12:39.501 --> 12:41.300
the last couple
of years?

12:41.334 --> 12:43.999
Who? Who?

12:44.033 --> 12:46.033
Don't tell me!
Don't tell me!

12:46.067 --> 12:49.334
Charades!

12:52.534 --> 12:54.200
All right.

12:54.234 --> 12:56.133
This is about...

12:56.167 --> 12:58.900
our new neighbor...
Jefferson.

12:58.934 --> 13:02.900
Jefferson!
Right!

13:02.934 --> 13:07.500
Now, the second part
is about...

13:07.534 --> 13:12.366
where he was
before he met Marcie.

13:12.400 --> 13:17.266
Okay, now,
sounds like...

13:17.300 --> 13:18.934
"Hisson."

13:18.968 --> 13:20.966
Hisson...

13:21.000 --> 13:22.400
Misson...

13:22.434 --> 13:24.033
Kisson...

13:24.067 --> 13:25.433
Disson...

13:25.467 --> 13:27.733
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.567
All right,
now try this.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.201
Two syllables.
First word.

13:33.834 --> 13:37.033
What do Jefferson,
Pete Rose,

13:37.067 --> 13:39.700
and your cousin
all have in common?

13:39.734 --> 13:40.867
Prison!

13:40.901 --> 13:42.733
Jefferson
was in prison!

13:42.767 --> 13:44.468
Yes!

13:49.334 --> 13:51.233
Gee, that's great.

13:51.267 --> 13:52.433
Does Marcie know?

13:52.467 --> 13:54.099
No, and we're not gonna
tell her either

13:54.133 --> 13:55.867
because then she'll
cancel the wedding,

13:55.901 --> 13:58.266
and I won't get to pay off
my retirement property.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.934
You mean our trip
to Hawaii.

13:59.968 --> 14:01.867
Yeah.

14:01.901 --> 14:03.733
Yeah.
That's what I meant.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.467
Oh, kiss me, you fool.

14:06.501 --> 14:08.001
Mmm-mwah.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.633
Get your rice!

14:14.300 --> 14:16.267
Get your wedding rice
here!

14:18.601 --> 14:19.800
Get your rice!

14:19.834 --> 14:20.900
Al.

14:20.934 --> 14:22.834
Honey, what is Bud's
soccer team

14:22.868 --> 14:25.099
and Kelly's model friends
doing here at the wedding?

14:25.133 --> 14:27.400
Oh, I had to cut a deal
with the damn kids.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.800
They said they'd
spill the beans

14:28.834 --> 14:30.333
if I didn't
give 'em a party.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.500
They blackmailed me, Peg.

14:32.534 --> 14:34.867
This lack of ethics,

14:34.901 --> 14:35.867
where does it come from?

14:35.901 --> 14:38.600
Well, I blame it
on TV myself.

14:38.634 --> 14:41.999
You don't think this is gonna
cut into our profit, do you?

14:42.033 --> 14:45.867
That's why I eliminated
some of Marcie's guests.

14:45.901 --> 14:47.500
Where's my mother?

14:49.133 --> 14:50.900
She won't be here,

14:50.934 --> 14:52.567
and you should hear this
from a friend:

14:52.601 --> 14:53.934
She doesn't love you
anymore.

14:53.968 --> 14:55.999
Get your red hots here!

14:56.033 --> 14:57.266
Well,
and where's Aunt Mary?

14:57.300 --> 14:58.867
Mary, Mary, Mary...

14:58.901 --> 14:59.999
Oh, she got got snowed in.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.233
She lives in Phoenix.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.166
Oh, yeah. that was Ida
who got snowed in.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.834
No, Mary's the one
who, uh...

15:04.868 --> 15:05.834
Who died.

15:05.868 --> 15:08.700
Get your wedding pretzels!

15:13.234 --> 15:14.966
Welcome to my wedding.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.267
Are you a friend
of the groom's?

15:18.167 --> 15:22.700
Al, I think Marcie's
getting suspicious.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.099
We better get
the show on the road

15:24.133 --> 15:25.567
and get me to Hawaii.

15:25.601 --> 15:27.733
I wanna be there
for the running of the Samoans.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.368
Okey-dokey.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.667
Well, what's that?

15:32.701 --> 15:34.999
That's the reverend.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.633
That's Captain Hank.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.333
See, a lot of these
Church-affiliated,

15:38.367 --> 15:39.467
land-lovin' reverends

15:39.501 --> 15:41.633
want money to perform
a wedding ceremony.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.867
But not old Captain Hank.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.934
<i>You give him a bottle
of redeye and a Playboy,</i>

15:44.968 --> 15:47.101
and he'll marry
your mother to a cow.

15:50.734 --> 15:55.467
<i>Retirement Property One
to Garbage Scow Toxica.</i>

15:55.501 --> 15:57.368
Come in.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.166
<i>Toxica here, Al.</i>

16:00.200 --> 16:01.467
<i>We're heading
into a squall.</i>

16:01.501 --> 16:03.166
<i>Let's kick this wedding
into gear, huh?</i>

16:03.200 --> 16:05.366
All right, everybody?
Take your places.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.900
Places, everybody.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.900
Where's Reverend Applebee?

16:10.934 --> 16:13.934
Uh, he had an exorcism
in Akron. Let's go!

16:13.968 --> 16:15.600
Let's go!

16:15.634 --> 16:18.033
Daddy, this is
the bestest graduation party

16:18.067 --> 16:19.467
a girl ever had.

16:19.501 --> 16:21.034
Thank you.

16:22.267 --> 16:26.600
She's so dumb she doesn't
even know she's at a wedding.

16:26.634 --> 16:28.700
Are you sure you spent

16:28.734 --> 16:30.600
the whole $2,000
on the wedding?

16:30.634 --> 16:31.633
You can look at all this

16:31.667 --> 16:34.267
and ask me a question
like that?

16:35.100 --> 16:37.301
Well, the bridesmaid's
in place.

16:46.534 --> 16:49.033
That's not my sister.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.567
Hey, unlike your sister,

16:50.601 --> 16:52.366
at least he cares enough
to be here.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.001
Now, bring on
the orchestra!

17:00.701 --> 17:02.401
* Fun *

17:05.267 --> 17:07.567
Honey,
enough of the music now.

17:08.767 --> 17:10.633
Jefferson, Jeff--
Come this way.

17:10.666 --> 17:14.101
You two approach
the speaker.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.834
Captain Hank,
you still there?

17:18.032 --> 17:20.633
<i>Yeah, but we're
takin' on water here.</i>

17:20.666 --> 17:22.032
<i>Have the couple join hands.</i>

17:22.067 --> 17:25.300
They're already
joined, Hank.

17:25.334 --> 17:27.532
<i>Do you take this woman
to be your wife?</i>

17:27.567 --> 17:28.900
I- I do.

17:28.934 --> 17:29.900
<i>I can't hear ya.</i>

17:29.934 --> 17:31.600
He did, Hank!

17:31.634 --> 17:33.800
<i>Now the broad.
Do you take-- ?</i>

17:33.834 --> 17:37.368
I would now like to read
a poem I wrote to my love.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.966
<i>Jefferson
My sudden love</i>

17:41.000 --> 17:42.867
<i>My love so true
My shining--</i>

17:42.901 --> 17:44.366
<i>Can't hear ya, hon!</i>

17:44.400 --> 17:45.900
I do!

17:46.234 --> 17:47.400
<i>I now pronounce you--</i>

17:47.434 --> 17:49.033
<i>Damn it, we just hit
a speedboat.</i>

17:49.067 --> 17:51.233
<i>You're now
husband and wife.</i>

17:51.267 --> 17:54.034
<i>Full astern.
Let's get outta here!</i>

18:01.267 --> 18:03.033
You may now
kiss the bride.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.567
I may now
kill the host.

18:05.601 --> 18:07.333
This is the worst day
of my life!

18:07.367 --> 18:09.600
Where are my guests?
Where's the photographer?

18:09.634 --> 18:13.234
I-- I did better than that.
I got a wedding artist. Bud.

18:24.701 --> 18:27.700
Copies will take
a couple of weeks.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.467
Al Bundy,
you will pay for this!

18:31.501 --> 18:32.966
You're a cheat,
a thief and a liar!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.266
Well, now...

18:34.300 --> 18:35.700
Would it make you
feel any better

18:35.734 --> 18:37.066
if I gave you
a wedding present?

18:37.100 --> 18:39.834
Well, it's a start.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.667
Okay.

18:41.701 --> 18:44.101
Your husband
was in prison.

18:49.801 --> 18:53.099
You were in prison,
and you didn't tell me?

18:53.133 --> 18:55.533
Well, I think it's time
to go to the airport.

18:55.567 --> 18:59.234
Kids, turn on the sprinklers.
Wedding's over.

19:02.534 --> 19:04.067
Son!

19:05.334 --> 19:09.533
You're looking at
the official owner of lot 31,

19:09.567 --> 19:10.733
right across the highway

19:10.767 --> 19:14.034
from a view of
Lake Chicamocomico.

19:14.934 --> 19:15.966
Cool, Dad.
Where's Mom?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.166
She's at the airport.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.366
Oh, don't worry,
she can earn enough to get home.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.500
She took her accordion
with her.

19:23.868 --> 19:25.266
Where's your sister?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.567
Oh. She went to Wisconsin
with the bikers.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.967
Okay.

19:30.033 --> 19:30.999
Al?

19:31.033 --> 19:32.467
Hey, Jefferson.

19:32.501 --> 19:33.900
Where's the blushing bride?

19:33.934 --> 19:35.266
She's jabbing a fork

19:35.300 --> 19:36.900
into the eyes
of the little groom

19:36.934 --> 19:39.133
that was on top
of our wedding Twinkie.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.133
Ah.

19:40.167 --> 19:43.033
Good. Good, good, good.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.999
Son, now look here.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.099
These giant
redwood trees?

19:47.133 --> 19:48.633
They're over
a thousand years old.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.266
I'm gonna cut me
one of these down,

19:50.300 --> 19:52.667
use it for the base
of my satellite dish.

19:52.701 --> 19:55.166
Listen, Al, I just stopped by
to thank you

19:55.200 --> 19:57.467
for utterly betraying
my trust.

19:57.501 --> 19:58.834
It was malicious
and foul,

19:58.868 --> 20:01.066
but I think it's gonna turn out
to be a blessing.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.800
I mean, it helps
get our marriage off

20:02.834 --> 20:05.400
to a honest, healthy,
harmonious start.

20:05.434 --> 20:07.033
Jefferson D'Arcy,

20:07.067 --> 20:11.633
get your lying,
inmate ass over here now!

20:16.901 --> 20:18.266
Oh, no.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.333
You know, in prison
I could have had her silenced

20:20.367 --> 20:22.133
for three cigarettes.

20:22.167 --> 20:23.233
Oh, well.

20:23.267 --> 20:24.700
Wait. By the way,
Mr. D'Arcy,

20:24.734 --> 20:25.966
What were you in for,
anyway?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.233
Nothing big.

20:28.267 --> 20:32.433
Just a scam to sell plots around
this toxic little waste pond

20:32.467 --> 20:34.500
called Lake Chicamocomico.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.800
The place
is so contaminated

20:42.834 --> 20:44.366
it won't be safe
for habitation

20:44.400 --> 20:46.301
till the year
5 million.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.934
Now, it hit the news
four years ago.

20:49.968 --> 20:51.233
Would you believe it?

20:51.267 --> 20:54.267
Some of the truly stupid are
still sending in payments.

20:55.934 --> 20:57.533
Ah, stupid.

21:20.734 --> 21:23.834
Well, it beats going to Hawaii
with your mother.

21:26.734 --> 21:29.533
And what's 5 million years
in the, uh...

21:29.567 --> 21:32.567
scheme of the life
of one man?

21:32.601 --> 21:34.333
Well, Dad,

21:34.367 --> 21:35.867
you always got
your dreams.

21:35.901 --> 21:37.867
Yeah, right.
