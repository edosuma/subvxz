WEBVTT

00:08.946 --> 00:12.034
You've been flagged for
recent expense patterns.

00:12.035 --> 00:14.163
I'm having dinner and drinks
with important people.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.125
You need to start living
within your means.

00:16.126 --> 00:19.508
There is a chain of command
in which decisions are made.

00:19.509 --> 00:21.804
Your boss has yet
to learn this lesson.

00:21.805 --> 00:24.475
Can you tell us what happened
a few months ago

00:24.476 --> 00:25.520
with your Palm Pilot?

00:25.521 --> 00:27.691
"Qimma" means mountaintop.

00:27.692 --> 00:29.528
But it also means summit.
A summit meeting.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.657
- In Malaysia.
- I'll get the

00:31.658 --> 00:33.786
Malaysian Special Branch
on this immediately.

00:33.787 --> 00:36.040
We're gonna need eyes
and ears in Kuala Lumpur.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.420
You've built an operation
based outside this country.

00:38.421 --> 00:40.717
Southeast Asia.

00:40.718 --> 00:42.344
What exactly do
you want from me?

00:42.345 --> 00:44.933
I definitely want us
to be more than buddies.

00:44.934 --> 00:45.935
Okay, then.

00:45.936 --> 00:47.523
Walla?

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.532 --> 02:16.659
Shit.

02:39.789 --> 02:41.207
AIQaeda?

02:41.208 --> 02:42.961
Please do not rush
to conclusions.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.463
What is the death toll?

02:44.464 --> 02:46.593
Ten so far.
The search continues.

02:46.594 --> 02:48.597
Please order a
patrol boat for me.

02:48.598 --> 02:50.476
Not safe. I can't allow it.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.651
Later today.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.613
Once we secure the harbor.

02:56.614 --> 02:58.701
I hope she doesn't sink.

02:58.702 --> 03:01.330
I'm sure every measure has
been taken to save her.

03:01.331 --> 03:03.919
You understand
our own FBI agents

03:03.920 --> 03:05.506
will have to investigate.

03:05.507 --> 03:07.467
Foreign law enforcement
in Yemen is forbidden.

03:07.468 --> 03:09.138
And nonnegotiable.

03:09.139 --> 03:11.142
There are dead Americans.

03:11.143 --> 03:14.189
If alQaeda did this,
it is an act of war.

03:14.190 --> 03:15.735
The enemy of peace is the enemy

03:15.736 --> 03:18.114
of all Islam, Ambassador Bodine.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.035
You have my word

03:20.036 --> 03:21.663
the FBI will collaborate
with the Yemen government

03:21.664 --> 03:23.835
and make as small
a footprint as possible.

03:38.948 --> 03:40.367
Don't tell me how it ends.

03:40.368 --> 03:43.122
I didn't know you were Yeah.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.337
On and off since I was a kid.
More on lately.

03:46.338 --> 03:49.093
Just... can't escape it.

03:49.094 --> 03:51.682
Can't run if it's inside you.

03:51.683 --> 03:54.228
You sure as shit
can't outrun a Jesuit.

03:54.229 --> 03:56.065
But it helps.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.694
Sometimes.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.448
I grew up in Beirut, boss.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.330
God was the fuel and the flame.

04:05.919 --> 04:08.882
Why now for you?

04:08.883 --> 04:11.429
Lot of pressure. I

04:11.430 --> 04:12.599
I need this one.

04:14.269 --> 04:16.189
Need it to go well.

06:27.786 --> 06:29.496
What the

06:29.497 --> 06:31.334
I told them you're a general.

07:00.935 --> 07:04.108
Welcome to Yemen,
General O'Neill.

07:24.482 --> 07:26.443
What's going on?

07:26.444 --> 07:29.449
We've been ordered to
relinquish our long guns, boss.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.828
Sa'adit al Jiniral.

07:30.829 --> 07:32.372
Is forbidden for the long guns.

07:32.373 --> 07:34.126
Who the fuck's in charge here?

07:34.127 --> 07:35.796
I am.

07:35.797 --> 07:38.134
Are you my point person
on the ground?

07:38.135 --> 07:40.806
Actually, no.
I'm Ambassador Barbara Bodine

07:40.807 --> 07:42.977
of the United States
Foreign Service.

07:42.978 --> 07:45.566
I am a guest of the Yemenis,

07:45.567 --> 07:47.277
and you are my guest.

07:47.278 --> 07:48.697
Here's how this will go.

07:48.698 --> 07:50.868
Your men will not
leave the hotel walls

07:50.869 --> 07:53.455
without one of their men
who speaks Arabic

07:53.456 --> 07:56.128
and understands
the culture and laws.

07:56.129 --> 07:59.342
Keep your handguns holstered
unless absolutely necessary

07:59.343 --> 08:02.265
for your safety. Who are you?

08:02.266 --> 08:05.354
John O'Neill, FBI.
Well, Agent O'Neill,

08:05.355 --> 08:07.903
please hand over your
long guns as requested.

08:23.058 --> 08:25.562
Around 11:18 local time,

08:25.563 --> 08:29.152
08:18 Universal
Coordinated Time,

08:29.153 --> 08:31.448
a small boat containing
an estimated

08:31.449 --> 08:34.246
400 to 700 pounds of explosives

08:34.246 --> 08:37.836
approached the port side of
the destroyer and exploded.

08:37.837 --> 08:41.510
17 dead sailors
have been identified.

08:41.511 --> 08:45.059
Kenneth Eugene Clodfelter, 21,

08:45.060 --> 08:47.731
Hull Maintenance Technician.

08:47.732 --> 08:50.862
Richard Costelow, 35,

08:50.863 --> 08:53.284
Chief Petty Officer.

08:53.285 --> 08:56.583
Lakeina Monique Francis, 19,

08:56.584 --> 08:59.170
Mess Management Specialist.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.928
Timothy Lee Gauna, 21.

09:02.929 --> 09:05.851
Information Systems Technician.

09:05.852 --> 09:07.897
Patrick Howard Roy.

09:16.582 --> 09:18.668
You're the case agent?

09:18.669 --> 09:20.797
When were you at
Quantico, Soufan?

09:20.798 --> 09:23.595
'97, sir.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.016
A lot of sailors
died on this ship.

09:26.017 --> 09:28.980
He's young, but he's good.

09:28.981 --> 09:32.195
Goddamn skiff the size
of my bass boat back home.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.698
I don't envy your job.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.913
Commander, 23MC on the bitchbox.

09:36.914 --> 09:38.918
'Scuse me.

09:45.347 --> 09:47.601
What's the population here?

09:47.602 --> 09:49.980
Million, million two.

09:49.981 --> 09:52.528
Like picking fly shit
out of pepper.

09:52.529 --> 09:54.824
That's if they're still here.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.744
They're still here.

09:56.745 --> 09:59.626
Looking at us right now.

10:09.437 --> 10:11.189
Sa'adit al Jiniral O'Neill?

10:11.190 --> 10:13.277
Yes, he is General O'Neill.

10:13.278 --> 10:15.949
Special Agent Ali Soufan.

10:15.950 --> 10:17.745
I am General Ghaleb AIQamish.

10:17.746 --> 10:20.040
I would like to escort you
to headquarters.

10:20.041 --> 10:21.376
We're fine, General.

10:21.377 --> 10:22.921
We got some leads
we want to pursue.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.424
Please, General.

10:24.425 --> 10:26.554
It won't be safe for you
and your colleague

10:26.555 --> 10:28.223
if you're just walking about.

10:28.224 --> 10:30.145
Please.

10:42.127 --> 10:44.422
You are married,
Sa'adit al Jiniral?

10:44.423 --> 10:46.218
Yeah. You?

10:46.219 --> 10:48.556
Yes, of course.

10:48.557 --> 10:51.646
And you, young Mr. Ali?

10:51.647 --> 10:53.650
No.

10:53.651 --> 10:55.988
You must marry.
It is Allah's will.

11:20.245 --> 11:22.833
Captain Amin of our Aden Police.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.168
He's our top guy.

11:24.169 --> 11:26.550
I leave you now with good hands.

11:30.432 --> 11:33.103
Our SAC, John O'Neill.

11:37.404 --> 11:39.032
Soufan, that's a Yemeni name.

11:39.033 --> 11:42.414
Lubnan.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.320
He asks you want sugar?

11:58.321 --> 12:01.869
Why you speak Arabic but live
in America, the beautiful?

12:01.870 --> 12:03.665
The FBI gave you job

12:03.666 --> 12:06.921
because you know
about secrets of our people?

12:06.922 --> 12:09.008
Maybe you have a blonde
American wife

12:09.009 --> 12:11.347
like Christina Aguilera?

12:13.309 --> 12:16.816
Why not married?

12:16.817 --> 12:20.030
So you won't speak Arabic to me?

12:20.031 --> 12:21.659
No.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.163
I don't trust you.

12:24.164 --> 12:26.085
Tell me about the boat trailer.

12:27.421 --> 12:28.923
Trailer?

12:28.924 --> 12:30.719
Trailers are usually by lakes,

12:30.720 --> 12:34.392
or where water freezes.
Not warm harbors.

12:34.393 --> 12:35.645
I don't know the trailer.

12:35.646 --> 12:38.568
In the back, behind the fence.

12:38.569 --> 12:41.574
I'll ask.

12:41.575 --> 12:43.745
Can you ask now?

12:43.746 --> 12:45.623
The man is not here today.

12:45.624 --> 12:48.254
When will the man be here?

12:51.260 --> 12:55.310
We make good advance on
the investigation for you.

12:55.978 --> 12:57.773
You see?

12:57.774 --> 13:00.152
All are held on suspicion.

13:00.153 --> 13:02.574
Suspicion of what?

13:02.575 --> 13:04.621
Suspicion,.

13:06.290 --> 13:07.793
Suspicion.

13:07.794 --> 13:10.005
We'd like to speak to them.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.216
Who?

13:11.217 --> 13:14.055
All of them.

13:14.056 --> 13:15.809
You must have a reason.

13:15.810 --> 13:20.735
Dead American sailors
is a reason.

13:20.736 --> 13:22.864
I'll tell you.

13:22.865 --> 13:25.410
The men you want to speak,
they are dead.

13:25.411 --> 13:28.041
Dead when the boat
they drive hit your boat.

13:28.042 --> 13:32.466
We'd still like to speak
to all these men.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.807
Sa'adit al Jiniral, please.

13:35.808 --> 13:38.478
We have our policy.

13:38.479 --> 13:41.192
We hold these men for a reason.

13:41.193 --> 13:43.865
You must bring me legal basis,

13:43.866 --> 13:45.785
or a good reason to interview.

13:45.786 --> 13:50.086
Then we decide, kaza,
kaza, kaza, who you talk.

14:08.665 --> 14:11.002
I wish I had one of those.

14:11.003 --> 14:13.007
You have several of us, boss.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.158
Where's your wife?

14:28.245 --> 14:30.708
With her mother, who is ill.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.760
I like you, General.

14:35.761 --> 14:37.889
And I will forgive
you did not understand

14:37.890 --> 14:40.771
never to ask about a man's wife.

14:42.190 --> 14:44.276
Sorry. You asked
if I was married.

14:47.868 --> 14:50.999
I was enquiring about
the character of a man.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.378
You were seeking the location
of a woman, you see?

14:53.379 --> 14:56.009
That's a subtle difference.

14:56.010 --> 14:58.180
I take no offence.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.185
It is a pleasure
to have the opportunity

15:01.186 --> 15:03.398
to sit with a friend
from beyond the borders

15:03.399 --> 15:04.818
of my little country.

15:04.819 --> 15:07.322
Perhaps together,
we can make decisions

15:07.323 --> 15:09.703
that will change the world
for the better.

15:09.704 --> 15:11.247
All before midnight.

15:17.511 --> 15:19.305
Hey.

15:19.306 --> 15:21.059
Never finished this in college.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.354
I read them all. Many twice.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.736
You're a better man than I.

15:30.119 --> 15:31.747
In the Arab world today,

15:31.748 --> 15:34.836
it is difficult to find
books written in English.

15:34.837 --> 15:38.426
All we have available
is Holy Qur'an,

15:38.427 --> 15:41.975
or Hadith, you see?

15:41.976 --> 15:44.480
The mind is closing.

15:44.481 --> 15:46.485
That makes me very sad.

15:49.826 --> 15:51.369
You play chess?

15:51.370 --> 15:53.081
No.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.418
Not really.

15:55.419 --> 15:58.383
Because I think you are
playing chess with me now.

15:58.384 --> 16:01.641
The compliments,
the late night visits.

16:04.814 --> 16:07.193
We do have a favor to ask.

16:10.909 --> 16:12.745
Please.

16:12.746 --> 16:15.458
The police have a boat
trailer frozen out back.

16:15.459 --> 16:18.507
We need the name and address
on the registration.

16:18.508 --> 16:20.385
Amin won't supply it.

16:20.386 --> 16:22.139
Yes, of course.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.519
Bring the official license
plate number to my office.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.272
Actually...

16:26.273 --> 16:28.862
can you do it now?

16:34.624 --> 16:38.088
You are pushy, Mr. Soufan.

16:39.382 --> 16:42.095
I am sad to see
you did not retain

16:42.096 --> 16:44.476
the polite manner
of our Arab people.

18:22.715 --> 18:24.175
Clear.

18:39.582 --> 18:42.003
See? Looking right at us.

19:19.662 --> 19:22.583
Hi, how's it going?

19:22.584 --> 19:24.838
Well, the Yemenis
provided a dredger,

19:24.839 --> 19:26.675
so we're searching
beneath the Cole,

19:26.676 --> 19:29.346
and Forensics ships what we
find to Dubai for analysis.

19:29.347 --> 19:31.433
It's a mess. You?

19:31.434 --> 19:33.856
Ever hear
the name Jamal alBadawi?

19:33.857 --> 19:36.403
The boat was registered to him.

21:24.494 --> 21:26.288
I've worked hard
in the state of Texas

21:26.289 --> 21:30.756
to make sure our institutions
arereflect the state,

21:30.757 --> 21:33.260
with good, smart policy.

21:33.261 --> 21:35.849
Policy that rejects quotas.
I don't like quotas.

21:35.850 --> 21:38.437
Quotas tend to pit one group
of people against another.

21:38.438 --> 21:40.024
Anything?

21:40.025 --> 21:42.988
That's not the way
America's all about.

21:42.989 --> 21:45.536
Kids.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.706
Can you believe this crap?

21:47.707 --> 21:49.794
Nobody mentioned terrorism.

21:49.795 --> 21:52.090
I mean, do these candidates
even know we're here?

21:52.091 --> 21:54.136
Or why?

21:54.137 --> 21:55.931
Both Republicans and
Democrats to pass a law

21:55.932 --> 21:57.560
that said if you come
in the top 10%

21:57.561 --> 21:59.187
of your high school class,

21:59.188 --> 22:02.153
you're automatically
admitted to one of our

22:04.282 --> 22:06.828
Ali?

22:06.829 --> 22:08.624
I'm still here.

22:10.002 --> 22:11.796
Are you?

22:11.797 --> 22:13.258
Yeah.

22:15.095 --> 22:16.557
What's going on?

22:20.314 --> 22:23.612
I saw these boys tonight.

22:23.613 --> 22:26.201
They were...

22:28.288 --> 22:34.717
Like my friends back in Beirut
when I was a kid

22:34.718 --> 22:36.221
when...

22:41.147 --> 22:42.608
What was that?

22:42.609 --> 22:45.030
It's nothing. Nothing.

22:50.457 --> 22:52.670
The kids that I work with,

22:52.671 --> 22:57.011
you know, the ones
that want to heal,

22:57.012 --> 23:01.270
they find a way
to tell their story.

23:01.271 --> 23:03.358
Saying it out loud helps.

23:05.362 --> 23:07.658
So you sit with them?

23:07.659 --> 23:09.411
Yeah.

23:09.412 --> 23:12.501
Yeah.

23:12.502 --> 23:15.006
It's nice to be
with someone, isn't it?

23:15.007 --> 23:18.013
It can be.

23:20.142 --> 23:23.064
I know that's gunfire.

23:28.743 --> 23:32.498
It is. It's nonstop here.

23:32.499 --> 23:35.547
Please be careful.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.677
I will.

24:06.527 --> 24:08.989
He says his boat was stolen.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.593
The boat and trailer are
registered to him

24:19.594 --> 24:22.098
in a house at
AISafarat District.

24:22.099 --> 24:24.855
The men who bombed the Cole
were living in that house.

24:46.314 --> 24:48.192
I told him about you.

24:48.193 --> 24:50.237
That you are
a human lie detector.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.292
Finish now.

26:20.293 --> 26:22.840
No work at prayer time. No work.

26:30.815 --> 26:33.194
I had him. Fuck!

26:39.206 --> 26:41.334
Amin shriveled up
when he heard Quso

26:41.335 --> 26:42.963
and the longnamed guy.

26:42.964 --> 26:45.885
Walid Mohammed Saleh bin
Roshayed bin Attash.

26:45.886 --> 26:47.054
I assume that's Quso.

26:47.055 --> 26:48.473
No. See, I didn't get that.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.269
Badawi's going up
the chain of command.

26:50.270 --> 26:51.772
Quso is next.

26:51.773 --> 26:54.654
Then long name guy.

27:18.786 --> 27:20.538
Quso owns the house?

27:20.539 --> 27:22.709
I don't think
we know who owns it.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.796
I don't think he knows.

27:24.797 --> 27:27.720
They keep the cells small.
Five or six at the most.

27:29.389 --> 27:32.186
He's saying that if you want
to know about the house,

27:32.187 --> 27:36.988
talk to Quso, or...
long name guy.

27:41.413 --> 27:43.543
Not possible,
Sa'adit al Jiniral.

27:43.544 --> 27:44.920
What's wrong with him?

27:44.921 --> 27:46.632
Quso is on your list.

27:46.633 --> 27:48.553
Again, I tell you
we have a system.

27:48.554 --> 27:50.222
Material witness
offers the name Quso.

27:50.223 --> 27:52.476
In our system, that would
justify bringing him in,

27:52.477 --> 27:54.063
or at least a knock
and talk visit.

27:54.064 --> 27:56.694
Mr. Ali tricked Badawi
with the lie detector.

27:56.695 --> 27:57.988
It's a joke, right?

27:57.989 --> 27:59.783
If he says Britney Spear,

27:59.784 --> 28:02.789
I can't bring you Britney Spear
here to talk for you.

28:02.790 --> 28:05.377
Britney Spear
is not on your list, man.

28:05.378 --> 28:07.966
The men you want are all dead.

28:07.967 --> 28:10.470
I'm gonna go above
your pay grade.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.642
Sa'adit al Jiniral,

28:12.643 --> 28:15.983
you give me reason,
I give you Quso.

28:19.616 --> 28:22.537
Hey.

28:22.538 --> 28:26.295
What are you afraid of, Amin?

28:29.051 --> 28:31.973
Not you, America Mr. Ali.

29:05.833 --> 29:08.253
Hotel bar remnants
from a better day.

29:08.254 --> 29:10.173
You shouldn't have.

29:10.174 --> 29:12.637
I wanted to.

29:12.638 --> 29:14.558
What is it?

29:14.559 --> 29:18.022
We can't make progress this way.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.903
Did you recently make the
great sociological discovery

29:20.904 --> 29:23.784
that far away foreign cultures
don't operate the same way

29:23.785 --> 29:25.830
mob thugs in Flushing do?

29:25.831 --> 29:28.126
17 dead American sailors
and their families

29:28.127 --> 29:30.923
want justice served.
Every one of those families

29:30.924 --> 29:32.552
would rather
live in a peaceful world.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.806
I need you to clear
a path for us.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.769
Yeah, I don't like
your hostility.

29:36.770 --> 29:38.774
Sit.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.745
We need Yemen!

29:45.746 --> 29:47.206
It borders Saudi Arabia,

29:47.207 --> 29:49.836
our most vital ally
in the Arab world.

29:49.837 --> 29:53.092
Every move you have made
since you've arrived

29:53.093 --> 29:55.013
has offended every man, woman,
and organization

29:55.014 --> 29:57.059
you've come in contact with.

29:57.060 --> 30:00.398
You make enemies, not progress
here in my country.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.944
You're confused.

30:01.945 --> 30:04.365
Isn't your country
the United States?

30:04.366 --> 30:07.496
We're citizens of a country
that offers so much,

30:07.497 --> 30:10.168
the rest of the world either
wants to be us or kill us.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.715
And my goal is to make sure
Yemen is the former.

30:12.716 --> 30:14.719
17 dead Americans!

30:14.720 --> 30:16.849
Their blood's gonna be
on your hands.

30:16.850 --> 30:18.978
After my initial tour
of the Cole,

30:18.979 --> 30:20.648
my clothes were covered
in blood.

30:20.649 --> 30:22.694
I could've gone to change
before my meeting

30:22.695 --> 30:26.158
with President Abdullah Saleh,
but I wanted him to see it.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.620
Don't talk to me about.

30:27.621 --> 30:30.084
Make the fucking
phone call, Bodine.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.385
Diplomacy will recover.

30:35.386 --> 30:37.975
Those sailors are gone forever.

30:44.279 --> 30:45.574
Please.

31:15.466 --> 31:17.762
Is this man in custody or what?

31:17.763 --> 31:20.852
You want to talk, so talk.

32:17.173 --> 32:19.219
If he's alQaeda,
just arrest him.

32:48.736 --> 32:51.534
He said he filmed the Cole.

33:56.706 --> 33:59.878
Usama's very
disappointed in you.

34:09.523 --> 34:11.483
He says he overslept.

34:20.377 --> 34:22.380
Are these men alQaeda?

34:32.318 --> 34:34.029
Say what you want from this man.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.032
Shh!

34:48.183 --> 34:53.860
$36,000 USA cash.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.910
He says the cash
was for a new leg.

36:41.911 --> 36:45.124
A new leg? A peg leg?

36:45.125 --> 36:47.756
Ask him if it's for
a guy named Khallad.

37:24.370 --> 37:26.164
I don't get it.

37:26.165 --> 37:29.295
The money's moving away
from an operation.

37:29.296 --> 37:31.467
Maybe it moves towards one.

37:36.060 --> 37:37.813
I need anything about Malaysia.

37:37.814 --> 37:42.614
Kuala Lumpur, a meeting.
Any of our suspects.

37:42.615 --> 37:43.992
Fahd alQuso,

37:43.993 --> 37:48.000
Khallad or Walid,

37:48.001 --> 37:49.754
Mohammed,

37:49.755 --> 37:54.262
Saleh bin Roshayed bin Attash.

37:54.263 --> 37:57.144
I don't have anything.
I'll check.

38:13.218 --> 38:14.845
We have another request.

38:14.846 --> 38:17.811
Play and talk first.

38:19.480 --> 38:23.362
Then I do a favor for you,
friend, a brother.

38:23.363 --> 38:25.407
Tric troc. I win.

38:25.408 --> 38:26.911
Did you cheat?

38:26.912 --> 38:29.917
I don't need to when I play you.

38:29.918 --> 38:32.088
You are ruthless.

38:32.089 --> 38:35.303
I'm a man of peace
in a military uniform.

38:36.430 --> 38:38.308
And you?

38:38.309 --> 38:39.980
You're a man of peace?

38:41.274 --> 38:44.697
I'm a man of justice.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.951
I'm sorry to say in this case
of the Cole

38:46.952 --> 38:49.205
the bad guys are all dead.

38:49.206 --> 38:53.005
AIQaeda's behind it.

38:53.006 --> 38:56.262
They're still watching us.
Planning more.

38:57.724 --> 39:00.979
My investigators told me
there were three men

39:00.980 --> 39:02.858
on the skiff.

39:02.859 --> 39:08.536
One, a young boy,
maybe 12 years old.

39:08.537 --> 39:13.295
This boy was likely born
in a bin Laden camp.

39:13.296 --> 39:16.092
And educated where they teach

39:16.093 --> 39:20.894
the Holy Qur'an,

39:20.895 --> 39:23.816
a book I sincerely doubt

39:23.817 --> 39:27.950
any alQaeda member
has ever read.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.287
In their version of this book,

39:30.288 --> 39:33.085
there are two forces
in the universe.

39:33.086 --> 39:38.095
Allah, good, and everything
else, evil.

39:38.096 --> 39:40.391
What does
President Clinton think

39:40.392 --> 39:43.898
when he puts this battleship
rising up in our harbor,

39:43.899 --> 39:45.359
like the devil himself,

39:45.360 --> 39:47.238
in a country where
there is only Allah

39:47.239 --> 39:49.409
and notAllah?

39:49.410 --> 39:52.123
If one squints at the mast,

39:52.124 --> 39:55.337
with American flag,
from the devil himself.

39:55.338 --> 39:56.841
You made your point.

39:56.842 --> 39:59.555
Killing is not the
appropriate response.

39:59.556 --> 40:01.309
I agree.

40:06.485 --> 40:08.699
I'm not trying to convert you.

40:15.796 --> 40:19.928
This is the only English
language book I have with me.

40:19.929 --> 40:22.141
John...

40:22.142 --> 40:26.024
mine is not a curious country
in these times.

40:26.025 --> 40:29.531
This book...
is seen as a threat.

40:29.532 --> 40:35.292
But I have always dreamed of
reading the Holy Bible.

40:35.293 --> 40:36.546
Thank you.

40:39.009 --> 40:41.847
That book has helped me often.

40:41.848 --> 40:44.143
I fear I have not been
thoughtful as you

40:44.144 --> 40:46.439
to bring a gift.
It's not necessary.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.115
I'd like for you to have this.

40:51.283 --> 40:54.414
Subhah, Islamic prayer beads.

40:54.415 --> 40:56.418
It belonged to my father.

40:56.419 --> 40:59.257
No, those belong to your
family. They're special.

40:59.258 --> 41:02.514
And the Holy Bible you gave me?

41:02.515 --> 41:05.437
Fair enough, from my
childhood, but...

41:07.065 --> 41:09.152
You insult me
if you don't accept.

41:09.153 --> 41:10.698
Please.

41:16.083 --> 41:17.544
Shukran.

41:17.545 --> 41:19.173
Afwan.

41:23.264 --> 41:25.978
And now, for the request.

41:27.230 --> 41:30.319
I need to speak to a Khallad.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.742
Is he alQaeda?

41:36.958 --> 41:39.756
I ask for you
but make no promise.

41:44.223 --> 41:46.142
Malaysia was
an operational issue.

41:46.143 --> 41:48.063
Intelligence. Not criminal.

41:48.064 --> 41:50.359
It is foreign soil
in the Pacific region.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.238
Not the domain of the FBI.

41:52.239 --> 41:54.408
The $36,000 originated offshore

41:54.409 --> 41:55.410
and was delivered offshore.

41:55.411 --> 41:57.875
CIA business.

44:10.014 --> 44:11.642
Ambassador Bodine.

44:11.643 --> 44:13.061
Special Agent O'Neill.

44:13.062 --> 44:14.480
I'd like to update you
on our progress.

44:14.481 --> 44:16.693
I'm listening.
Dredging for evidence

44:16.694 --> 44:17.987
beneath the Cole
has been completed,

44:17.988 --> 44:19.574
shipped for analysis.

44:19.575 --> 44:21.452
The Quso interrogation,
which you arranged,

44:21.453 --> 44:24.250
led to a name we believe is
the mastermind of the attack.

44:24.251 --> 44:26.087
Khallad.

44:26.088 --> 44:27.632
Thank you.

44:27.633 --> 44:30.096
Are we okay? You and I?

44:32.768 --> 44:35.022
As we ever were.

44:36.358 --> 44:38.152
What do you have
for me, Colonel?

44:38.153 --> 44:41.535
We have a heavy lift ship
moving South from Europe.

44:41.536 --> 44:43.413
Are bending to political
pressure

44:43.414 --> 44:45.500
by easing standards for
considering

44:45.501 --> 44:47.045
whether a ballot counts.

44:47.046 --> 44:49.049
The board had been
throwing out ballots

44:49.050 --> 44:52.306
that did not have two corners
poked out of the chad.

44:52.307 --> 44:53.392
The b.

44:55.689 --> 44:57.942
Give me the FBI office
in New York.

44:57.943 --> 44:59.947
Right away.

45:05.667 --> 45:07.336
Ambassador Bodine.

45:07.337 --> 45:09.341
Yes, thank you.

45:10.802 --> 45:13.641
It... is a difficult time.

45:13.642 --> 45:17.064
Listen, I'm having a bit
of a problem here

45:17.065 --> 45:19.069
with one of your guys.

45:25.331 --> 45:27.627
Maybe they need you back home.

45:27.628 --> 45:30.508
Nah, it's a different play.
I'm getting jerked by Sanchez.

45:30.509 --> 45:32.469
Just wish me luck. All right.

45:32.470 --> 45:34.474
General!

45:40.403 --> 45:43.324
I found about the man you want.

45:43.325 --> 45:45.329
Khallad.

45:48.377 --> 45:52.678
A better gift than old prayer
beads, agree?

45:55.642 --> 45:56.935
Thank you.

45:56.936 --> 45:58.397
Shukran, shukran.

46:00.192 --> 46:02.947
I'm not a general anymore.

46:02.948 --> 46:04.158
Salam.

46:04.159 --> 46:06.163
Salam.

46:11.173 --> 46:13.093
Salam, brother John.
