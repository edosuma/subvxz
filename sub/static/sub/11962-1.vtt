00:39.240 --> 00:41.038
Look at her smile, see, like

00:41.033 --> 00:44.412
- her dimples stick out.
- The Lord is my shepherd.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.253
Know what I mean?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.295
I shall not want.

00:48.290 --> 00:51.510
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

00:52.962 --> 00:55.590
He leads me beside still waters.

00:57.007 --> 00:58.634
He restores my soul.

01:00.135 --> 01:04.265
He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's...

01:14.191 --> 01:16.444
The story of Cheryl Dempsey and what she became

01:16.443 --> 01:19.413
is truly one of the strangest, most disturbing things

01:19.405 --> 01:23.501
I've ever come across in the history of serial murder.

01:24.868 --> 01:28.714
I've been doing this for close to 25 years now.

03:01.131 --> 03:03.350
I had a tenant in this house here

03:03.342 --> 03:05.891
who was a very terrible person.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.891
This is the house where they found the Poughkeepsie tapes.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.892
Before we got our hands on the Poughkeepsie tapes,

03:11.892 --> 03:13.610
we thought...

03:13.602 --> 03:15.024
Well, we knew there had been some killings

03:15.020 --> 03:16.897
and we were aware that some of them appeared

03:16.897 --> 03:18.899
as though they were being carried out

03:18.899 --> 03:20.446
in an organized fashion,

03:20.442 --> 03:23.321
but until we got our hands on those tapes,

03:23.320 --> 03:26.699
we had no idea what we were dealing with.

03:28.492 --> 03:29.584
No idea.

03:29.576 --> 03:32.796
It was my job to watch and log all 2,400 hours

03:32.788 --> 03:34.415
of the Poughkeepsie tapes.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.507
In the first month alone,

03:35.499 --> 03:39.049
I couldn't sleep for more than an hour or two at night.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.762
I still have nightmares about them.

03:40.754 --> 03:44.804
I think torturing and murdering turn him on.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.349
And I think these tapes are something

03:47.344 --> 03:50.598
of a homemade porn film or a memento

03:50.597 --> 03:53.396
that he can savor long after the murder.

03:53.392 --> 03:54.735
He has definitely stalled

03:54.726 --> 03:58.606
halfway through many a killing to switch tapes.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.867
I remember one night,

04:01.859 --> 04:03.827
I brought some of the tapes home with me

04:03.819 --> 04:07.699
to keep working, and unbeknownst to me,

04:07.698 --> 04:11.248
my wife watched about half an hour of one of the tapes

04:11.243 --> 04:15.373
and it took her a year before she let me touch her again.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.418
That's what's on those tapes.

04:21.378 --> 04:24.006
They found the tapes in this closet.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.931
And down here, you know.

04:30.220 --> 04:34.066
When we searched the yard we found the bodies of two women

04:34.057 --> 04:35.434
there, and there.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.779
We found a deep hole here where there was buried

04:38.770 --> 04:41.523
a young couple and their 10-month-old baby.

04:41.523 --> 04:43.696
There was a body of a man there,

04:43.692 --> 04:47.822
and four more women there, there, there, and there.

04:50.574 --> 04:53.043
And it was obvious that they'd all

04:53.035 --> 04:55.709
been killed in a horrific manner.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.595
Beside me here is one complete set of the tapes.

05:02.586 --> 05:06.386
And just to give you a sense, from about here,

05:15.974 --> 05:19.899
to here, are all about Cheryl Dempsey.

05:19.895 --> 05:21.317
When people think of serial killers

05:21.313 --> 05:23.156
they think of four or five people.

05:23.148 --> 05:26.869
You know, Ted Bundy, Dahmer, Gacy, et cetera.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.118
But what most people don't realize

05:30.113 --> 05:32.332
is how many more there are.

05:33.575 --> 05:35.998
At any given time, there are somewhere between

05:35.994 --> 05:40.044
25 and 50 active serial killers in America alone.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.838
It is really a much bigger problem than most people realize.

05:46.755 --> 05:50.055
There are probably hours and hours of these tapes

05:50.050 --> 05:52.348
that nobody's watched except me.

05:52.344 --> 05:55.974
Like, for example, there's over 100 hours

05:55.973 --> 05:59.102
of weird balloon stuff on these tapes.

06:05.524 --> 06:07.367
Like this?

06:07.359 --> 06:08.235
Yes.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.418
Like this?

06:24.418 --> 06:25.294
Yes.

06:29.673 --> 06:30.925
Now pop it.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.471
What?

06:32.467 --> 06:33.593
Pop it!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.574
If I've learned one thing

06:47.566 --> 06:50.661
from teaching this class, it's this.

06:50.652 --> 06:53.781
After what we're gonna see here today,

06:53.780 --> 06:56.499
three of you will go home tonight

06:56.491 --> 07:01.088
and decide that this is not what you want with your life.

07:01.079 --> 07:04.174
You know, there are some terrible people in this world

07:04.166 --> 07:07.136
who do unbelievably terrible things.

07:09.129 --> 07:13.350
So it's important that each of you ask yourself,

07:13.342 --> 07:17.688
do I really wanna surround myself with these terrible things

07:17.679 --> 07:20.728
for the rest of my professional life?

07:23.602 --> 07:25.730
And it's okay if you don't.

07:25.729 --> 07:29.279
I would guess something happened in his life at that time.

07:29.274 --> 07:33.654
He got in a fight, lost a job, got left by his wife,

07:33.654 --> 07:37.284
something like that, and went out in his car

07:37.282 --> 07:39.956
and at some point said,

07:39.951 --> 07:43.330
the next vulnerable person I see is dead.

08:49.855 --> 08:50.651
Hi.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.703
I like your dolls.

08:59.781 --> 09:01.909
I said, I like your dolls.

09:02.868 --> 09:04.211
What's that one's name?

09:04.202 --> 09:05.249
Susie.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.374
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.168
Well, you're not supposed

09:11.168 --> 09:13.387
to have bad manners either.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.224
You know, if I was the Big Bad Wolf

09:18.216 --> 09:21.186
there's nothing you can do about it.

09:24.014 --> 09:26.517
You wanna say something to the camera?

09:26.516 --> 09:27.483
Like what?

09:28.351 --> 09:29.193
I don't know.

09:29.186 --> 09:31.314
Maybe you could say, I am,

09:33.356 --> 09:36.030
I am a happy, pretty little girl.

09:37.486 --> 09:38.282
No.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.618
You wanna see what it looks like through the camera?

09:43.617 --> 09:44.413
No.

09:45.368 --> 09:46.335
Here.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.757
On first inspection, it looked like

10:35.752 --> 10:39.598
she had been hit in the head with a blunt object.

10:39.589 --> 10:42.513
We found there was a missing girl, Jennifer Gorman,

10:42.509 --> 10:46.264
eight years old, from Putnam County, about 50 miles away,

10:46.263 --> 10:50.439
fitting the description, last seen in similar clothes.

11:00.986 --> 11:01.828
I think something bad

11:01.820 --> 11:02.867
has happened to my daughter.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.910
I think somebody took her.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.327
- Like who?
- I don't know who!

11:05.323 --> 11:06.165
Out of the yard!

11:06.157 --> 11:08.034
There's blood out there, please, do something.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.126
Do something, do something!

11:09.119 --> 11:09.961
- Somebody took her!
- If it's a missing person

11:09.953 --> 11:11.250
- we have to wait 24 hours.
- No!

11:11.246 --> 11:13.465
There is blood, there is blood out there.

11:13.456 --> 11:15.174
Send the police now!

11:22.173 --> 11:24.517
Obviously, you don't ever get over something like this.

11:24.509 --> 11:27.729
You think the pain will subside, and...

11:32.684 --> 11:33.901
And get better.

11:36.521 --> 11:37.989
But it doesn't.

11:37.981 --> 11:39.028
Not at all.

11:40.275 --> 11:44.280
What kind of a sick bastard rapes a little girl.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.077
She was just a child.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.325
She was barely eight.

11:48.325 --> 11:49.372
I'm so sorry.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.845
This is nothing.

11:59.836 --> 12:02.589
He doesn't even know what he's doing yet.

12:10.805 --> 12:11.806
Hey, having a little car problem?

12:11.806 --> 12:13.524
Yeah, this old thing

12:13.516 --> 12:16.235
isn't even worth driving some days.

12:16.227 --> 12:18.355
Could I get a lift into the next town?

12:18.355 --> 12:19.197
Yeah, no problem.

12:19.189 --> 12:19.985
Hop in.

12:29.658 --> 12:31.126
Do you mind if I film this?

12:31.117 --> 12:34.963
I'm making a little movie about my trip.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.878
Knock yourself out.

12:36.873 --> 12:39.922
Look Hon, we're gonna be movie stars.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.844
So what's your name?

12:44.839 --> 12:45.635
Ed.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.559
Ed, I'm Frank, this is Jeanette.

12:48.551 --> 12:49.347
Hi.

12:55.016 --> 12:57.314
If you take this exit up here,

12:57.310 --> 13:00.154
you can drop me off at the little gas station.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.363
Okay.

13:12.909 --> 13:14.582
It's to the right here,

13:14.577 --> 13:17.000
just a couple miles off the freeway.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.466
All right.

13:19.457 --> 13:21.505
You from around here?

13:21.501 --> 13:22.969
Not really.

13:25.130 --> 13:26.848
Where are you from?

13:28.174 --> 13:32.304
I think the gas station's right around the bend.

13:56.745 --> 13:59.168
Oh my god!

13:59.164 --> 14:00.336
Oh my god!

14:23.396 --> 14:25.945
A Poughkeepsie couple vanished over the weekend,

14:25.940 --> 14:27.817
seemingly without a trace.

14:27.817 --> 14:29.319
Family members say they haven't heard

14:29.319 --> 14:30.866
from Frank or Jeanette Anderson

14:30.862 --> 14:33.035
since they left Pittsburgh last Friday.

14:33.031 --> 14:34.658
Authorities still have no leads

14:34.657 --> 14:36.284
as to the couple's whereabouts.

14:36.284 --> 14:40.460
This homicide announces a completely new kind of killer.

14:40.455 --> 14:42.924
There is almost nothing left of the impulsiveness

14:42.916 --> 14:45.886
that he displayed with Jennifer Gorman.

14:45.877 --> 14:50.599
Here is a man who's figured out he's good at something.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.184
Imagine what it would take to do this.

14:53.176 --> 14:55.725
From the seat behind her he takes a rag

14:55.720 --> 14:58.394
with some sort of chemical agent with his right hand,

14:58.389 --> 15:01.188
and he places it over her mouth.

15:01.184 --> 15:02.936
And with his left hand holding the camera

15:02.936 --> 15:05.109
he's reaching it out and holding it

15:05.105 --> 15:08.154
in front of her face like this.

15:08.149 --> 15:11.574
This isn't the kind of thing that just happens.

15:11.569 --> 15:14.869
He must've practiced this motion thoroughly to get it right.

15:14.864 --> 15:17.708
I mean, his car's parked alongside the road.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.579
He knows where the next gas station is,

15:20.578 --> 15:23.457
he knows it's only a mile or two off the freeway,

15:23.456 --> 15:25.800
and he knows that it's a desolate area

15:25.792 --> 15:28.887
between the freeway and the gas station.

15:28.878 --> 15:31.757
In fact, this station is abandoned,

15:32.799 --> 15:35.848
and I bet he knows that too.

15:35.844 --> 15:39.644
And he had a ready-made excuse for the camera.

15:40.932 --> 15:44.482
This man is what we call a mixed killer.

15:44.477 --> 15:48.277
He plots and hides his crimes in an organized manner,

15:48.273 --> 15:52.403
but he mutilates and does, well, let's say similar things

15:53.486 --> 15:57.616
with the bodies that a disorganized killer would do.

16:04.372 --> 16:05.589
Wake up.

16:06.875 --> 16:07.671
Wake up.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.295
Come on, wake up.

16:11.754 --> 16:15.634
Come on, wake up, I have a surprise for you.

16:15.633 --> 16:17.886
Wake up.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.724
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up.

16:22.974 --> 16:23.725
Wake up.

16:25.143 --> 16:25.939
Wake up.

16:27.187 --> 16:27.983
Wake up.

16:29.439 --> 16:30.235
Wake up.

16:34.235 --> 16:36.203
You're gonna love this.

16:58.676 --> 16:59.893
Yeah, I know.

17:02.472 --> 17:04.348
Today the search for a missing Poughkeepsie couple

17:04.348 --> 17:07.193
ends tragically, this when human remains are found

17:07.185 --> 17:10.155
buried in a wooded area of rural Pennsylvania.

17:10.146 --> 17:11.522
They brought a woman's body in

17:11.521 --> 17:13.900
that was very badly mutilated.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.403
The corpse had a head placed in its abdomen

17:16.402 --> 17:19.781
in a kind of strange, ceremonial fashion.

17:19.781 --> 17:21.782
I took one look at the skull,

17:21.782 --> 17:24.252
the upper edges of the eye orbits were smooth,

17:24.243 --> 17:26.087
and the cranial vault was rigid,

17:26.079 --> 17:28.423
and showed heavy muscular markings.

17:28.414 --> 17:31.543
I said, this is a man's head in a woman's body.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.965
This is two murders, not one.

17:33.962 --> 17:35.839
After talking to their friends and families,

17:35.838 --> 17:38.307
we were able to ascertain that the Andersons

17:38.299 --> 17:40.267
were coming back from Pittsburgh

17:40.260 --> 17:42.854
to Poughkeepsie where they lived.

17:42.845 --> 17:47.146
That distance winds up being about 350 miles or so.

17:47.141 --> 17:49.894
The nice thing about this route,

17:49.894 --> 17:51.988
is that there are really only a couple

17:51.980 --> 17:54.403
of logical ways to drive it.

17:54.399 --> 17:56.777
Under the best conditions, that particular make of car

17:56.776 --> 17:59.199
can only go about 200 miles to the tank,

17:59.195 --> 18:00.742
more likely about 150.

18:00.738 --> 18:03.958
So we went from that point on the freeway,

18:03.950 --> 18:06.248
200 miles in both directions,

18:06.244 --> 18:09.168
and we went to every gas station along the route

18:09.163 --> 18:11.541
and asked to see their surveillance tapes

18:11.541 --> 18:13.589
from that particular day.

18:14.711 --> 18:17.681
That took some doing, but we did manage to get

18:17.672 --> 18:21.802
our first video image of the killer in this manner.

18:34.105 --> 18:36.107
What's he doing with his hand?

18:36.107 --> 18:37.984
He's signing.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.452
That's right.

18:39.444 --> 18:41.617
Anybody know what he's saying?

18:41.612 --> 18:42.579
Red house.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.619
Good.

18:46.117 --> 18:48.666
Right, we found the second body in the woods

18:48.661 --> 18:51.790
behind a place called the Red House Tavern

18:51.789 --> 18:54.042
about three miles away.

18:54.042 --> 18:57.216
But the thing to keep in mind is this.

18:57.211 --> 19:01.182
He signed this before he even met the Andersons.

19:03.301 --> 19:06.180
Timeliness is of the essence in any investigation,

19:06.179 --> 19:08.523
but especially a murder.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.141
If we find a fresh crime scene,

19:10.141 --> 19:13.315
there's just a lot more information to work with

19:13.311 --> 19:15.029
than say, a skeleton.

19:16.731 --> 19:19.951
Often, the serial killers who avoid detection and capture

19:19.942 --> 19:24.413
are the ones who are especially good at disposing of bodies.

19:24.405 --> 19:28.251
The killer documented on the Poughkeepsie tapes

19:28.242 --> 19:30.995
is very, very good at it.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.544
Not only does he know how to dispose of bodies,

19:33.539 --> 19:37.715
he knows how to dispose of bodies in many different ways.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.509
Elizabeth Jackson was abducted in Hanson County,

19:40.505 --> 19:42.849
which is about 100 miles from the location

19:42.840 --> 19:45.184
we later found the tapes in.

19:45.176 --> 19:46.894
The killer then took a circular saw,

19:46.886 --> 19:49.355
cut off her head and hands.

19:49.347 --> 19:52.726
He then dumped her torso in Putnam County,

19:52.725 --> 19:55.069
and her head and hands in Broome County.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.029
When someone's disposed of like this,

19:57.021 --> 19:59.649
it's almost impossible to put it all together

19:59.649 --> 20:03.244
because even if the various counties did talk,

20:03.236 --> 20:05.989
and they don't, but even if they did,

20:05.988 --> 20:10.084
there may be a five year gap between finding the head

20:11.577 --> 20:14.171
and the torso of a body like this.

20:14.163 --> 20:16.382
I see this and I say, okay,

20:17.542 --> 20:20.216
here's a killer who understands bureaucracy.

20:26.092 --> 20:27.719
Usually a killer won't think through

20:27.718 --> 20:29.595
their first dismembering,

20:29.595 --> 20:31.188
and they have a dead body in the house

20:31.180 --> 20:32.807
and they need to take it apart.

20:32.807 --> 20:34.855
So they go out to the garage and get a saw

20:34.851 --> 20:38.651
and take some hours to get the head off.

20:38.646 --> 20:41.445
So the next time, they'll go and get a better saw

20:41.441 --> 20:44.320
before they kill someone, and that makes it a little better,

20:44.318 --> 20:48.118
but if they really wanna get into the killing,

20:50.825 --> 20:53.795
they'll often go and get a real saw.

20:55.037 --> 20:58.587
Something that cuts through quick and easy.

21:00.168 --> 21:03.342
And at that point, they'll never go back to a handsaw.

21:03.337 --> 21:06.807
Except this guy, he did it repeatedly.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.303
Sometimes he uses a circular saw, sometimes a handsaw.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.520
It's part of the reason that we never

21:11.512 --> 21:13.981
grouped his killings together.

21:14.891 --> 21:17.519
It's probably why he did it.

21:17.518 --> 21:20.146
But after all that effort to mask his killings,

21:20.146 --> 21:24.492
He shows us each and every disassembly in his tapes.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.033
I guess he just wanted someone to appreciate

21:27.028 --> 21:30.032
how good he is at this, and the thought that maybe

21:30.031 --> 21:33.661
we'd be strangely sort of impressed with it.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.170
Are you?

21:36.162 --> 21:37.334
No.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.583
After seeing what he did to Cheryl Dempsey,

21:39.582 --> 21:43.212
I could feel nothing but loathing for this guy.

22:17.995 --> 22:20.248
It was so sweet.

22:20.248 --> 22:22.671
Should've gone with you.

22:23.459 --> 22:24.301
Cow's gone on her trip.

22:24.293 --> 22:27.137
My mom was being such a bitch.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.255
How long are they gone for?

22:28.256 --> 22:30.008
Like a week.

22:30.007 --> 22:31.680
Like Wednesday, right?

22:31.676 --> 22:32.973
Yeah.

22:37.723 --> 22:38.599
No.

22:39.767 --> 22:40.768
Tim?

22:40.768 --> 22:42.111
Yeah?

22:42.103 --> 22:45.903
Do you ever get a feeling?

22:45.898 --> 22:47.070
What do you mean?

22:47.066 --> 22:51.572
Like feeling like something's going to happen?

22:51.571 --> 22:53.369
Sometimes, why?

22:53.364 --> 22:54.365
It's weird.

22:54.365 --> 22:56.538
Everything's been so good lately.

22:56.534 --> 22:59.629
Everybody seems to be happy, and everything's just like,

22:59.620 --> 23:01.497
too good, you know?

25:40.698 --> 25:42.075
Hello?

25:43.033 --> 25:44.000
Is that you?

25:45.578 --> 25:46.374
Tim?

26:01.469 --> 26:02.345
Hello?

26:02.344 --> 26:03.220
Hello?

26:03.220 --> 26:04.346
Is that you?

26:04.346 --> 26:06.269
Hey, you mind if I grab something to eat?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.266
Yeah, go ahead.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.643
Can you grab some ice cream while you're down there?

26:08.642 --> 26:09.689
Sure.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.574
Will you grab me a towel?

26:15.483 --> 26:18.077
I know you're still there.

26:18.068 --> 26:20.617
Come on, you're not scaring me.

26:28.037 --> 26:29.880
Hey, what kind of ice cream did you want?

26:29.872 --> 26:31.465
Whatever, chocolate?

26:31.457 --> 26:32.504
Done.

27:20.297 --> 27:21.549
You scared me.

27:21.549 --> 27:23.176
You shouldn't jump out at somebody like that.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.472
Sorry.

27:24.468 --> 27:27.267
I brought you ice cream, and beer.

27:27.263 --> 27:28.059
Thanks.

27:29.056 --> 27:31.400
Why did you move my clothes?

27:31.392 --> 27:32.769
I didn't.

27:33.727 --> 27:36.276
They were all over the place.

27:40.901 --> 27:42.027
Come here.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.279
Why?

27:43.279 --> 27:44.155
You'll see.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.375
Let's just go watch a movie.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.040
Like what?

27:50.035 --> 27:52.413
I rented a couple.

27:53.289 --> 27:57.294
You wanna stay here for a while?

27:57.293 --> 27:59.466
Maybe for a little while.

29:24.338 --> 29:25.590
Hey.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.967
We're starting to fall asleep.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.095
You wanna go to bed?

29:30.094 --> 29:31.687
Yeah, yeah okay.

29:31.679 --> 29:32.976
You're staying over tonight, right?

29:32.972 --> 29:34.269
Yeah.

29:34.264 --> 29:35.231
Cool.

29:35.224 --> 29:37.818
I get a little scared here by myself.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.812
I think I might too.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.485
Do you mind putting this stuff in the sink?

29:41.480 --> 29:43.232
I just wanna pee and brush my teeth.

29:43.232 --> 29:44.449
No, it's fine.

29:44.441 --> 29:46.159
Thank you.

31:06.648 --> 31:09.447
This weekend ends in tragedy for one family.

31:09.443 --> 31:11.821
Victoria and James Dempsey returned home

31:11.820 --> 31:13.663
after leaving their 19-year-old daughter,

31:13.655 --> 31:16.329
Cheryl Dempsey, home alone for the weekend.

31:16.325 --> 31:18.703
Now when they returned they found Cheryl missing,

31:18.702 --> 31:23.082
and her boyfriend, Tim Surrey, brutally murdered.

31:23.082 --> 31:27.633
I remember maybe three days before Cheryl's abduction

31:27.628 --> 31:32.099
she asked me, do you ever feel like someone's watching you?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.889
I said not really.

31:33.884 --> 31:35.886
And she told me, sometimes I feel like

31:35.886 --> 31:39.186
maybe someone's following me around.

31:39.181 --> 31:41.354
I said, you know, you're probably just being paranoid.

31:41.350 --> 31:43.444
And she said, yeah, maybe.

31:44.353 --> 31:47.277
You know, hindsight's 20/20.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.204
What's happening?

31:53.195 --> 31:54.071
Where am I?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.085
Stay away from me!

32:00.077 --> 32:00.873
Stay away!

32:01.870 --> 32:04.623
Why are you doing this to me?

32:08.752 --> 32:10.504
Please don't hurt me.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.974
I'll do whatever you want.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.183
I know you will.

32:16.051 --> 32:16.847
Shut up!

32:21.014 --> 32:22.982
What is your name?

32:22.975 --> 32:24.147
Cheryl Dempsey.

32:24.143 --> 32:24.939
Wrong!

32:28.063 --> 32:29.610
Your name is slave.

32:34.111 --> 32:35.579
What is your name?

32:36.822 --> 32:37.994
Cheryl.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.128
Your name is slave!

32:46.748 --> 32:48.000
What is your name?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.092
My name is slave!

32:49.084 --> 32:50.210
What is your name?

32:50.210 --> 32:51.712
Slave!

32:51.712 --> 32:53.339
What is your name?

32:53.338 --> 32:54.134
Slave!

33:00.053 --> 33:01.145
Good.

33:15.444 --> 33:18.869
Because of the gruesome condition of Tim's body,

33:18.864 --> 33:21.242
we had very little hope of finding Cheryl alive.

33:21.241 --> 33:24.370
His head had been crushed in, kind of like this.

33:24.369 --> 33:29.341
And he had been cut from his anus up to his throat,

33:29.333 --> 33:32.086
and his intestines had been pulled out

33:32.085 --> 33:35.715
and strewn around like they were Christmas tree lights.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.888
And his genitals had been removed and they were placed

33:38.884 --> 33:42.605
in the sock drawer in the master bedroom.

33:42.596 --> 33:44.018
Our basic thinking was that the killer

33:44.014 --> 33:47.439
had lost all control of his faculties,

33:47.434 --> 33:50.529
and again, judging from the condition of the body,

33:50.520 --> 33:54.024
that he had probably killed her here,

33:54.024 --> 33:57.995
and then probably dumped her body in the woods.

33:57.986 --> 33:59.488
We took one look at the scene and wrote it off

33:59.488 --> 34:02.037
as the work of a disorganized killer.

34:02.032 --> 34:04.251
The truth we later learned from the Poughkeepsie tapes

34:04.243 --> 34:06.666
was that this killer had carefully crafted

34:06.662 --> 34:08.710
the murder site to mislead us.

34:08.705 --> 34:09.831
And it worked.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.379
Funny thing is, to be able to murder and mutilate a body

34:14.378 --> 34:18.757
in such a way and to maintain composure while doing so,

34:18.757 --> 34:21.886
coupled with his bizarre sense of theatricality,

34:21.885 --> 34:26.014
you know, the masks and costumes and whatnot,

34:26.014 --> 34:29.813
shows that this man is extremely mentally ill.

34:29.810 --> 34:31.777
Comedia del arte is a form of theater

34:31.770 --> 34:34.523
that dates back to 16th century Italy.

34:34.523 --> 34:36.321
They actually had to pass a law prohibiting

34:36.315 --> 34:39.034
carrying weapons while wearing a mask,

34:39.027 --> 34:41.871
because people stopped being responsible for their actions

34:41.862 --> 34:43.331
the moment they put one on.

34:43.322 --> 34:45.542
I think the costumes serve two functions.

34:45.534 --> 34:49.083
First, they let him draw out the act of killing.

34:49.079 --> 34:52.333
And second, they help him to alleviate any sense of guilt

34:52.331 --> 34:55.632
or regret he may have for the horrible things he's doing.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.176
This character went out of fashion hundreds of years ago.

34:58.171 --> 35:01.721
It's the character Dottore Peste.

35:01.717 --> 35:03.765
The Doctor of the Plague.

35:11.768 --> 35:13.896
Why are you crying?

35:15.439 --> 35:17.316
'Cause I want my mom.

35:18.358 --> 35:20.156
I want my mom.

35:20.152 --> 35:23.031
Didn't I tell you?

35:23.030 --> 35:23.872
What?

35:23.864 --> 35:26.492
I killed your mom.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.710
I killed your whole family.

35:30.078 --> 35:31.830
I'm all you have left.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.457
No, no you didn't.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.130
You tell me!

35:37.419 --> 35:41.344
Tell me you're happy I killed your family.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.466
No!

35:45.010 --> 35:45.977
What?

35:46.887 --> 35:48.013
No.

35:49.097 --> 35:49.973
No!

35:50.807 --> 35:51.603
No!

36:04.154 --> 36:04.950
Say it!

36:09.034 --> 36:09.910
Say it!

36:09.910 --> 36:10.752
What?

36:10.744 --> 36:11.836
What?

36:11.828 --> 36:14.877
You're happy I killed your parents!

36:22.381 --> 36:23.177
Say it!

36:26.468 --> 36:27.264
What?

36:28.470 --> 36:30.063
I'm happy you killed my parents.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.057
Say it again.

36:32.057 --> 36:34.105
I'm happy you killed my parents.

36:34.101 --> 36:36.820
You don't have parents.

36:36.812 --> 36:38.155
You're a slave.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.192
I'll say it.

36:43.193 --> 36:44.410
Those people.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.033
I'm happy that you killed them.

36:49.032 --> 36:49.828
Why?

36:51.576 --> 36:52.623
Why?

36:52.619 --> 36:53.620
Why!

36:55.747 --> 36:58.045
Because I don't like them!

37:09.761 --> 37:12.310
Who do you like?

37:12.305 --> 37:13.522
You.

37:14.558 --> 37:15.434
Who?

37:16.435 --> 37:18.062
Only you.

37:22.023 --> 37:22.899
Why?

37:24.526 --> 37:26.620
Because you're the master,

37:26.611 --> 37:29.080
and it please me to serve you.

37:32.909 --> 37:34.911
Did you want me to kill those people.

37:34.911 --> 37:36.538
Yes.

37:36.538 --> 37:37.505
I don't know.

37:37.497 --> 37:38.339
Yes!

37:38.331 --> 37:39.173
I don't know!

37:39.166 --> 37:40.008
Yes!

37:40.000 --> 37:42.002
That's why I did it.

37:42.002 --> 37:43.925
I did it because of you.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.968
Thank you Master!

37:45.964 --> 37:46.760
Thank you!

37:48.008 --> 37:49.681
Say it.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.303
You're the master.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.022
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

37:57.851 --> 38:01.606
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

38:05.358 --> 38:06.780
You're the master...

38:09.613 --> 38:11.911
People have come from as far away as Lancaster County

38:11.907 --> 38:15.332
to search the wooded area around the Dempsey residence.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.421
This in hopes of finding any clues

38:17.412 --> 38:19.540
in the disappearance of their daughter Cheryl.

38:19.539 --> 38:24.386
I'd just like to say to the person who's done this,

38:24.377 --> 38:27.221
please bring my daughter back home.

38:39.351 --> 38:43.481
If there's anything I can do to help,

38:43.480 --> 38:45.027
please let me know.

38:46.233 --> 38:47.029
Thanks.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.160
Wait.

38:55.867 --> 38:56.663
Wait.

38:58.119 --> 38:58.961
Oh my god.

38:58.954 --> 39:02.333
Oh my god.

39:03.291 --> 39:07.421
I play that moment in my head over and over again.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.467
I knew it was him, and I didn't stop him

39:11.466 --> 39:13.059
because I was scared.

39:26.815 --> 39:30.410
Are you through screaming?

39:30.402 --> 39:31.870
Do you need water?

39:51.089 --> 39:55.219
If I take the gag off, will you do something for me?

40:11.735 --> 40:13.863
I want you to put this on.

40:28.918 --> 40:33.048
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

40:34.341 --> 40:37.015
Pleases me to serve you.

40:37.010 --> 40:40.184
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

40:59.532 --> 41:02.160
By the summer of '93, the area was really

41:02.160 --> 41:05.505
starting to feel the effects of this man's work.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.875
Most killers getting this much media attention

41:07.874 --> 41:09.842
will do one of three things.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.836
One, they will realize it's not safe

41:11.836 --> 41:15.557
for a serial killer to work that town anymore and leave.

41:15.548 --> 41:17.721
Two, they will give it a rest for a little while

41:17.717 --> 41:19.845
and let it cool off.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.562
Or three, they'll just keep doing it,

41:21.554 --> 41:23.648
maybe even speed of the rate of their killings,

41:23.640 --> 41:25.517
until they get caught.

41:25.517 --> 41:29.192
But this killer did something quite unique,

41:29.187 --> 41:31.736
he kept killing, but changed his MO.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.445
A third body was found here today.

41:36.444 --> 41:38.196
We're standing on the west bank

41:38.196 --> 41:39.994
of the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie,

41:39.989 --> 41:41.616
police believe this to be another killing

41:41.616 --> 41:44.495
by the man some are calling the Water Street Butcher.

41:44.494 --> 41:45.495
Sixth killing believed to be the work

41:45.495 --> 41:47.213
of the Water Street Butcher.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.878
Police are warning local prostitutes

41:48.873 --> 41:50.841
to stay off the streets.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.107
Wasn't me!

42:14.315 --> 42:16.738
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.079
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.162
You're the master and it pleases...

42:23.158 --> 42:24.705
This ain't right.

42:24.701 --> 42:27.204
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

42:27.203 --> 42:28.876
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

42:30.915 --> 42:33.464
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

42:37.422 --> 42:38.594
At around the same time we started

42:38.590 --> 42:42.311
getting word from the prostitutes that worked that area

42:42.302 --> 42:44.179
that girls are getting arrested

42:44.179 --> 42:46.352
and never being heard from again.

42:46.347 --> 42:47.815
You can't just arrest me!

42:47.807 --> 42:49.275
You can't arrest me!

42:53.855 --> 42:55.072
Will you help me?

42:55.064 --> 42:56.407
No.

42:56.399 --> 42:58.493
Please, I, come on!

42:58.485 --> 43:01.409
No, no, he won't like it.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.657
If I'm with you, he can't stop you.

43:03.656 --> 43:04.498
He won't like it.

43:05.325 --> 43:06.702
No, no, no, no!

43:08.912 --> 43:09.708
No!

43:16.961 --> 43:18.508
No, no, no, please!

43:19.464 --> 43:20.340
Please no!

43:20.340 --> 43:21.136
No, no!

43:24.385 --> 43:25.682
Please no!

43:25.678 --> 43:27.055
Oh no, oh no, no!

43:32.477 --> 43:33.444
Now you.

43:33.436 --> 43:34.858
No, she was trying to escape...

43:38.775 --> 43:39.822
No I didn't!

43:39.818 --> 43:40.614
I didn't!

43:49.619 --> 43:50.916
Okay.

43:50.912 --> 43:52.880
This is your punishment.

44:24.946 --> 44:27.745
All of the victim's bodies had been mutilated.

44:27.740 --> 44:31.290
In part to cover up the bite marks on them.

44:32.871 --> 44:36.717
They all had been sliced from mouth to ear,

44:36.708 --> 44:39.928
and they had been raped postmortem.

44:39.919 --> 44:44.049
And we found matching sperm on four of the bodies.

44:45.508 --> 44:48.808
Years ago, I was granted the dubious honor

44:48.803 --> 44:52.478
of interviewing Theodore Robert Bundy

44:52.473 --> 44:55.067
in connection with another case.

44:55.059 --> 44:59.189
But the insight that I gained there is relevant here.

45:00.899 --> 45:03.869
I remember the first question he asked me was, did he...

45:03.860 --> 45:04.736
Rape her?

45:05.820 --> 45:08.289
Ah, yes he did.

45:08.281 --> 45:09.749
Before or after?

45:11.993 --> 45:14.212
Before or after what?

45:14.203 --> 45:16.171
You know, killing her.

45:18.291 --> 45:19.793
After.

45:19.792 --> 45:23.922
You see Mike, I think that's an important distinction.

45:24.923 --> 45:28.143
This might all sound a little weird but

45:29.427 --> 45:31.646
the kill and rape variety,

45:31.638 --> 45:34.482
these guys will continue to have sex with the body

45:34.474 --> 45:38.900
way past the point where we thought possible.

45:38.895 --> 45:43.321
Mild decomposition, even maggots and things,

45:43.316 --> 45:45.785
may just serve to turn him on.

45:47.028 --> 45:50.658
Next time you find a fresh dump site,

45:50.657 --> 45:52.500
keep quiet about it.

45:52.492 --> 45:53.539
Stake it out.

45:54.786 --> 45:56.754
Your guy'll come back to it.

45:56.746 --> 46:00.546
Unfortunately, we have never found a fresh enough body.

46:00.541 --> 46:03.294
But there was evidence that he had

46:03.294 --> 46:07.424
in fact been returning to them, for sexual reasons.

46:29.237 --> 46:31.660
Hi, we're selling cookies.

46:31.656 --> 46:33.499
Would you like to buy some?

46:33.491 --> 46:34.458
Uh...

46:35.952 --> 46:37.545
Sure.

46:37.537 --> 46:39.790
Sure, why don't you come in.

46:41.624 --> 46:44.343
Um, we're not really supposed to.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.429
Well that's smart.

46:46.421 --> 46:49.015
You know, there's a lot of weirdos out there,

46:49.007 --> 46:51.806
but I'm a policeman, so it's okay.

46:53.553 --> 46:54.395
Okay.

46:54.387 --> 46:55.639
Okay.

46:55.638 --> 46:56.730
Come on in.

47:06.774 --> 47:08.401
Just sit right there.

47:08.401 --> 47:09.527
Okay.

47:15.575 --> 47:16.872
Okay.

47:16.868 --> 47:18.745
Hey, you girls want some Cokes?

47:18.745 --> 47:19.667
Sure.

47:19.662 --> 47:20.914
- Yeah?
- Okay.

47:20.913 --> 47:21.880
Okay.

47:28.421 --> 47:29.388
Thank you.

47:36.179 --> 47:39.900
Hey, did you ride your bikes here today?

47:39.891 --> 47:42.440
No, I live over on Dupont.

47:42.435 --> 47:44.813
Oh, so you live in the neighborhood?

47:44.812 --> 47:45.563
Yeah.

47:47.023 --> 47:47.945
I don't.

47:47.940 --> 47:50.659
I live over by Central.

47:50.651 --> 47:52.449
Well, before you leave,

47:52.445 --> 47:55.574
do you tell your parents where you go?

47:56.699 --> 47:57.791
Sometimes.

47:57.784 --> 47:58.785
Yeah.

47:58.785 --> 47:59.752
Yeah.

48:04.791 --> 48:06.464
What's that?

48:06.459 --> 48:07.426
What?

48:08.544 --> 48:10.262
I thought I heard something.

48:10.254 --> 48:14.134
Oh, well I left the TV on in the basement.

48:14.133 --> 48:15.601
Oh.

48:18.554 --> 48:20.181
You know, it sounds like I'm not

48:20.181 --> 48:23.355
going to be able to get cookies today.

48:23.351 --> 48:26.776
You know, I get a raccoon in the basement sometimes.

48:26.771 --> 48:29.945
There's no raccoons around here.

48:29.941 --> 48:31.989
Sure there are.

48:31.984 --> 48:36.785
Hey, do you wanna see the raccoon I got in the basement?

48:36.781 --> 48:37.577
Sure.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.827
He's awful mean.

48:40.827 --> 48:42.625
I don't believe you.

48:43.538 --> 48:44.585
I wanna go.

48:47.333 --> 48:50.382
You know I'll have to get cookies some other day.

48:50.378 --> 48:53.097
Why don't you let yourselves out?

48:58.136 --> 48:59.934
Mark him off.

49:15.611 --> 49:18.160
Sounds like something got loose down there.

49:18.156 --> 49:20.250
I'm sorry Master, I thought that it was tight.

49:20.241 --> 49:22.289
You felt pity for it.

49:22.285 --> 49:23.582
You tried to let it go.

49:23.578 --> 49:24.921
No, no Master.

49:24.912 --> 49:26.380
I would never betray you.

49:26.372 --> 49:28.420
This is your fault.

49:28.416 --> 49:29.633
No.

49:47.268 --> 49:49.362
Suddenly, we had 10 bodies.

49:49.353 --> 49:53.859
Six of whom had matching samples of semen on them.

49:53.858 --> 49:55.576
Then we had a breakthrough.

49:55.568 --> 49:57.195
At one of the victim's apartments,

49:57.195 --> 50:00.870
we found an unwashed glass of water.

50:00.865 --> 50:04.586
It had a fingerprint and DNA from the saliva.

50:05.745 --> 50:08.669
We ran the prints we found on the glass of water.

50:08.664 --> 50:11.508
It came back with a match.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.174
It matched my partner, Jim Foley.

50:15.254 --> 50:18.258
They placed him under arrest and started building a case.

50:18.257 --> 50:20.476
He had been in town for all those killings,

50:20.468 --> 50:22.721
and there were three killings in Pennsylvania

50:22.720 --> 50:24.097
that matched the same MO,

50:24.096 --> 50:28.351
and he had been in Pennsylvania on family vacation.

50:28.351 --> 50:31.821
He had no substantiated alibi for any of the murders.

50:31.812 --> 50:33.564
We searched his car and his house

50:33.564 --> 50:38.035
and found jewelry and bloodstains that matched the victims.

50:38.027 --> 50:40.906
That point, we knew we had our man.

50:57.296 --> 50:59.924
When they came and arrested my dad

50:59.924 --> 51:02.803
as the Water street Butcher, it was devastating.

51:02.802 --> 51:06.147
I couldn't sleep, I dropped out of school,

51:06.138 --> 51:09.392
I became a freak even to my own friends.

51:09.392 --> 51:11.645
Everything changed in one second.

51:11.644 --> 51:13.988
Foley had no alibi for these murders

51:13.980 --> 51:17.359
because he was a cop who rode in an unmarked cruiser

51:17.358 --> 51:19.486
by himself most of the time.

51:19.485 --> 51:23.115
There was plenty of time for him to commit these crimes.

51:23.114 --> 51:26.163
Secondly, he had a history of getting prostitutes.

51:26.158 --> 51:30.254
Apparently Mr. Foley was a fairly regular customer.

51:30.246 --> 51:33.591
One of the prostitutes, Cindy Jackson, took the stand

51:33.582 --> 51:35.004
and placed him in the neighborhood

51:35.001 --> 51:38.631
at the time of three of the abductions.

51:38.629 --> 51:40.427
As defense, my hands were really tied

51:40.423 --> 51:43.597
because he kept refusing a plea bargain of any kind.

51:43.592 --> 51:45.265
I kept telling him, Jim,

51:45.261 --> 51:48.140
they're gonna kill you if you don't cop a plea.

51:48.139 --> 51:50.392
He kept telling me that he'd fire me

51:50.391 --> 51:53.736
and defend himself if I didn't shut up about it.

51:53.728 --> 51:56.072
It was really quite frustrating.

52:08.159 --> 52:09.706
He was my father.

52:12.455 --> 52:16.005
Now it's over and he needs to be punished.

52:23.716 --> 52:25.935
But I think that your life should be spared,

52:25.926 --> 52:28.429
because we are not like you.

52:35.561 --> 52:37.780
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

52:37.772 --> 52:39.945
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

52:42.068 --> 52:44.116
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

52:46.405 --> 52:48.874
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

52:50.785 --> 52:52.879
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

52:54.830 --> 52:57.208
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

52:59.210 --> 53:00.837
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

53:02.380 --> 53:04.132
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

53:06.008 --> 53:08.602
You're the master and it pleases me to serve you.

53:08.594 --> 53:10.767
The governor has not granted reprieve,

53:10.763 --> 53:14.484
James Foley will be executed within the hour.

53:44.547 --> 53:46.015
Two members of the execution team

53:46.006 --> 53:48.725
are preparing their injections.

53:48.717 --> 53:50.594
A third is standing by.

53:59.728 --> 54:01.696
The superintendent will now give the condemned

54:01.689 --> 54:04.738
the opportunity to make a last statement.

54:04.733 --> 54:07.828
He has declined to make a last statement.

54:14.368 --> 54:18.339
He's afforded the opportunity for prayer.

54:18.330 --> 54:21.049
The condemned has declined this also.

54:36.557 --> 54:40.687
We have now completed the first phase of the execution.

54:42.688 --> 54:46.818
We have now completed the second phase of the execution.

54:48.319 --> 54:49.571
We have now completed the third

54:49.570 --> 54:52.289
and final phase of the execution.

54:57.244 --> 55:01.715
One of the physicians is now making his examination.

55:01.707 --> 55:04.711
Now the second is making his check.

55:04.710 --> 55:08.806
Now the third and final physician is making his check.

55:08.797 --> 55:10.799
Examination is completed.

55:10.799 --> 55:12.801
The superintendent has advised the witnesses

55:12.801 --> 55:16.601
that death did occur at 12:24 on this date.

55:40.079 --> 55:43.959
When I got home, I found a map in my mailbox.

55:45.167 --> 55:48.262
There was a mark on it that said, "Missed one."

55:48.254 --> 55:49.756
And then my phone rang.

55:49.755 --> 55:52.349
They said you gotta get down here and see this.

55:52.341 --> 55:53.638
It was another body.

55:53.634 --> 55:55.307
I knew right away.

55:55.302 --> 55:58.476
Death by lethal injection.

55:58.472 --> 56:00.315
After three stays of execution,

56:00.307 --> 56:02.355
the death warrant has now been issued,

56:02.351 --> 56:05.901
and James Foley will be put to death within the hour.

56:05.896 --> 56:09.617
In 1996, a jury convicted and sentenced Foley to death

56:09.608 --> 56:11.030
for the brutal murders of four women

56:11.026 --> 56:13.449
in Pennsylvania and Upstate New York.

56:13.445 --> 56:16.289
Authorities believe the death toll to be much higher.

56:16.282 --> 56:18.876
We need to stop killing everyone.

56:18.867 --> 56:20.460
And if the government sanctions it

56:20.452 --> 56:23.456
it just gives everyone a taste for blood.

56:23.455 --> 56:25.924
Pennsylvania's third execution in 25 years.

56:25.916 --> 56:27.714
Right after I go work,

56:27.710 --> 56:31.556
police come in and handing me DNA sample,

56:31.547 --> 56:34.346
and demanding I do immediate.

56:34.341 --> 56:36.639
I was very stressful.

56:36.635 --> 56:40.765
And it turn out same as Water Street Butcher, James Foley.

56:41.932 --> 56:43.434
We're still not sure.

56:43.434 --> 56:45.186
Apparently he had gone to a fertility clinic

56:45.185 --> 56:49.782
some years before, we think maybe that's how.

56:49.773 --> 56:51.650
But we're still not sure.

56:51.650 --> 56:54.699
Three days after my dad's execution,

56:54.695 --> 56:57.915
they realize that he had been innocent.

56:57.906 --> 57:00.204
They were gonna put out a thing in the paper the next day,

57:00.200 --> 57:03.124
and then 9/11 happened.

57:03.120 --> 57:07.250
So, the article on clad gets bumped down to page six.

57:08.584 --> 57:12.384
Former cop cleared of charges after execution.

57:13.339 --> 57:16.593
People still jokingly when I say my name they'll ask,

57:16.592 --> 57:19.596
any relation to the Water Street Butcher?

57:19.595 --> 57:23.520
And I tell them, Jim Foley wasn't the Water Street Butcher.

57:23.515 --> 57:27.645
Nobody heard that they found him innocent, 'cause of 9/11.

57:28.896 --> 57:30.773
Any other week in American history

57:30.773 --> 57:33.401
and this would've been a serious national sensation.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.121
Serial killer kills cop using justice system.

57:38.739 --> 57:40.207
Come on.

57:40.199 --> 57:42.543
But then September 11th happened,

57:42.534 --> 57:46.414
and no one gave a shit about anything else.

57:46.413 --> 57:48.211
You know, after 10 or more years

57:48.207 --> 57:51.711
of planning and executing what I considered to be

57:51.710 --> 57:56.056
the crime of the century, nobody even heard about it.

57:56.048 --> 58:00.178
See, when people read there's a serial killer in town,

58:01.178 --> 58:04.808
their guards go up, which was happening.

58:04.807 --> 58:06.400
But then when they read the serial killer

58:06.392 --> 58:10.363
only preys on prostitutes, if you're not a prostitute,

58:10.354 --> 58:13.153
your defenses are going to go back down.

58:13.148 --> 58:16.994
So he created this Water Street Butcher persona

58:16.985 --> 58:21.081
to assuage people's fears about this unknown killer.

58:21.073 --> 58:25.203
So that he could continue to prey on everyone else.

58:28.455 --> 58:29.297
- Hi.
- Hi,

58:29.289 --> 58:30.211
you having some car trouble?

58:30.207 --> 58:32.460
Oh yeah, my car just died.

58:32.459 --> 58:33.551
I don't know what's wrong with it.

58:33.544 --> 58:35.421
Oh, you need me to call you a tow truck?

58:35.421 --> 58:36.923
Oh, Officer, thank you.

58:36.922 --> 58:38.640
That would be great.

58:38.632 --> 58:40.054
I've been stuck here for over an hour.

58:40.050 --> 58:41.927
You know, you really shouldn't be out here

58:41.927 --> 58:43.645
by yourself with that Water Street Butcher

58:43.637 --> 58:45.355
on the loose and all.

58:47.850 --> 58:49.852
I thought he just attacked prostitutes?

58:49.852 --> 58:51.149
Hey, look, there's a gas station

58:51.145 --> 58:53.193
a mile down where you'll be safe.

58:53.188 --> 58:54.360
Let me drop you there,

58:54.356 --> 58:57.075
then you won't have to wait out here alone.

58:57.067 --> 58:58.819
You wouldn't mind?

58:58.819 --> 58:59.786
Not at all.

58:59.778 --> 59:01.906
Oh, thank you, okay.

59:01.905 --> 59:03.657
I have a lot of stuff up here,

59:03.657 --> 59:06.877
would you mind jumping into the back?

59:06.869 --> 59:08.667
Sure, sure, why not.

59:15.919 --> 59:16.715
Thank you.

59:21.341 --> 59:24.436
This is what it looks like to be arrested, huh?

59:24.428 --> 59:26.351
Hey, you ever been arrested?

59:28.515 --> 59:31.860
Not that I care to admit to.

59:31.852 --> 59:35.948
I once got arrested for drinking underage, but that's it.

59:47.117 --> 59:49.586
Wow, I've had such a long day.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:05.053
I think, I think that was the exit to the gas station.

01:00:05.052 --> 01:00:09.353
Excuse me, wasn't that the exit to the gas station?

01:00:09.348 --> 01:00:11.146
I guess it was.

01:00:15.354 --> 01:00:16.526
Perhaps you better turn around.

01:00:16.522 --> 01:00:20.026
You know, can I ask you something?

01:00:20.025 --> 01:00:20.947
What?

01:00:20.943 --> 01:00:22.160
Would you please turn around?

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:24.120
Why did you call me Officer?

01:00:24.112 --> 01:00:25.238
Sorry, what do you mean?

01:00:25.239 --> 01:00:26.707
Well, before you got into the car,

01:00:26.698 --> 01:00:29.326
you called me Officer.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.499
Why did you call me that?

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:35.216
I thought police liked it when you called them that.

01:00:35.207 --> 01:00:36.800
Well, they do.

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:38.089
But I'm not cop.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:42.005
You're not?

01:00:42.923 --> 01:00:43.719
No.

01:00:46.301 --> 01:00:48.770
That's not very funny.

01:00:48.762 --> 01:00:51.561
Well, I'm not trying to be.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.776
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

01:01:02.776 --> 01:01:04.244
What are you then?

01:01:05.279 --> 01:01:06.997
I'm a butcher.

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:25.344
That's not funny.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.263
Yeah, no, it's not.

01:01:27.259 --> 01:01:30.433
You shouldn't get into stranger's cars.

01:01:34.308 --> 01:01:35.651
You're not a cop?

01:01:35.642 --> 01:01:37.895
Didn't you learn about assumptions?

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:40.273
They make an ass of u and me.

01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:48.530
Where are you going?

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.998
You'll see.

01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:00.209
Please don't do this.

01:02:00.208 --> 01:02:01.050
Sir?

01:02:01.043 --> 01:02:02.169
Please don't hurt me.

01:02:02.169 --> 01:02:03.341
I'm...

01:02:03.337 --> 01:02:05.931
I'm, I'm a good person, I have a family,

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:07.766
and they'll tell someone I'm missing.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:10.602
I'm so sorry, perhaps I made you want to do this...

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:12.141
Well how about this, I'll make you a deal.

01:02:12.137 --> 01:02:12.979
Yeah?

01:02:12.971 --> 01:02:16.191
We'll pull over, and I'm gonna rape you.

01:02:16.183 --> 01:02:19.813
But then, then if you've been good,

01:02:19.811 --> 01:02:23.941
and you haven't done anything stupid, I won't kill you.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:28.407
Okay.

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:32.495
You think I'd fall for that?

01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:34.869
You're not just gonna let me rape you.

01:02:34.868 --> 01:02:35.869
Yes I am.

01:02:35.869 --> 01:02:38.088
I don't believe you.

01:02:39.831 --> 01:02:40.627
Why?

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.930
You know, to be perfectly honest,

01:02:50.926 --> 01:02:53.304
I don't think either of us are gonna want you alive

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:56.432
for the things I'm going to do to you.

01:03:05.732 --> 01:03:07.109
I'm so sorry!

01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:08.110
Please, let me...

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:09.657
Obviously I wouldn't

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.701
leave handles on the doors.

01:03:24.543 --> 01:03:26.887
Somebody help me!

01:03:26.878 --> 01:03:27.674
Help me!

01:03:31.091 --> 01:03:33.344
Oh my god, somebody help me!

01:03:37.055 --> 01:03:37.851
No!

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:47.240
Help me!

01:03:47.232 --> 01:03:48.905
Somebody help me!

01:05:52.732 --> 01:05:56.612
This killer knows how to play the profile

01:05:56.611 --> 01:05:59.740
in exactly the way he wants,

01:05:59.739 --> 01:06:02.083
just like a really good actor

01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:06.922
can make you think they're really crying, or laughing.

01:06:06.913 --> 01:06:08.881
To give you an example of what I mean,

01:06:08.874 --> 01:06:12.003
let me read a couple of these profiles.

01:06:14.212 --> 01:06:17.762
Suspect is a white male, age 18 to 25.

01:06:17.757 --> 01:06:20.135
White male, age 25 to 35.

01:06:20.135 --> 01:06:22.763
Black male, age 25 to 30.

01:06:22.762 --> 01:06:24.605
Disorganized, highly organized.

01:06:24.598 --> 01:06:27.272
Serial killer, most likely his first time killing.

01:06:27.267 --> 01:06:29.861
First killing, definitely not his first killing.

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:32.402
Lives alone, probably in a very messy house.

01:06:32.397 --> 01:06:34.274
His home will be clean and kempt.

01:06:34.274 --> 01:06:36.572
Sadist, sadistic, sadist.

01:06:36.568 --> 01:06:38.491
Has most likely been institutionalized

01:06:38.486 --> 01:06:40.284
for a good portion of his life.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.783
Highly functional, may have limited faculties.

01:06:42.782 --> 01:06:45.205
Highly intelligent, probably highly educated.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:46.670
Most likely never finished high school.

01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:49.005
Most likely works in law enforcement,

01:06:48.997 --> 01:06:51.796
possibly a police officer or a security guard.

01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:54.214
Probably lives off some sort of disability.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.633
Most likely cannot hold a job.

01:06:55.629 --> 01:07:00.351
Knows profiling, and may be employed as an FBI profiler.

01:07:12.354 --> 01:07:15.107
I went back to the map that the killer had sent me.

01:07:15.106 --> 01:07:17.734
It was made online using MapQuest.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:19.202
So I put in a call to the FBI

01:07:19.194 --> 01:07:21.447
to see what we could get from this.

01:07:21.446 --> 01:07:23.699
They got the records from MapQuest,

01:07:23.698 --> 01:07:25.621
and only one download was made

01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:29.793
from that exact map during the month in question.

01:07:29.788 --> 01:07:32.132
My name is Captain Harvey Scroggs.

01:07:32.123 --> 01:07:33.875
I lead the assault on the house.

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:38.005
As I like to say, we dropped the whole hammer on him.

01:07:39.172 --> 01:07:43.143
Helicopters, SWAT, clogs, bomb squad, everything.

01:07:45.136 --> 01:07:46.183
Just in case.

01:08:05.407 --> 01:08:06.249
It's clear!

01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:07.083
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:08:07.075 --> 01:08:08.543
Clear.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:13.752
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:08:13.748 --> 01:08:14.715
All clear.

01:08:14.708 --> 01:08:17.426
People ask me how we found him,

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.970
and I say, first, we didn't find him.

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:23.261
Just this house.

01:08:23.258 --> 01:08:27.229
And second, we didn't find it, he gave it to us.

01:08:28.763 --> 01:08:31.185
He wanted us to find it.

01:08:31.182 --> 01:08:34.106
And that's further evidenced by the fact that there

01:08:34.102 --> 01:08:38.232
was not one single fingerprint in the entire house.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:43.825
Over here on the wall, got a little bit of blood here.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.915
And here, point the camera down Sean, point it down.

01:08:46.906 --> 01:08:50.331
Got one, two, three, four, five boxes of videotapes

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:51.920
numbered sequentially...

01:08:51.911 --> 01:08:53.037
Hey guys.

01:08:53.037 --> 01:08:54.631
Hey guys, come here.

01:08:54.622 --> 01:08:56.249
Come on.

01:08:58.292 --> 01:08:59.510
Whoa.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.046
Get in here Sean.

01:09:02.046 --> 01:09:03.390
Get over here.

01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:04.176
Over here.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.551
Ready?

01:09:06.551 --> 01:09:07.346
Go.

01:09:10.471 --> 01:09:11.268
My god.

01:09:12.474 --> 01:09:14.522
Is she alive?

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.779
Oh my god she is.

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:18.647
We need a medic in here.

01:09:18.645 --> 01:09:20.694
Get a medic in here now!

01:09:27.988 --> 01:09:29.582
Oh, people kept trying to tell me

01:09:29.573 --> 01:09:33.374
all those years that Cheryl was probably dead.

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:36.670
That I should probably start to move on.

01:09:38.124 --> 01:09:39.966
But I wouldn't.

01:09:39.959 --> 01:09:44.089
I kept telling everyone, I have to keep hope until I know.

01:09:46.758 --> 01:09:49.352
But then I got the call.

01:09:49.344 --> 01:09:52.644
The officer said, we found your daughter.

01:09:52.639 --> 01:09:55.267
And I thought he meant her body.

01:09:58.144 --> 01:10:01.193
I have never seen a human being

01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:04.409
born and raised in the United States

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:07.405
show evidence of this kind of torture.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.406
She had been burned, cut,

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:14.253
she had five teeth removed by pliers or a hammer.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:15.917
She had multiple broken bones.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:18.916
Not only that none of them have been allowed to heal,

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:21.134
some have been further aggravated

01:10:21.126 --> 01:10:24.630
by some sort of tightening apparatus.

01:10:24.629 --> 01:10:28.759
She had also been extremely malnourished,

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:32.854
and her organs were in really bad shape as a result.

01:10:32.846 --> 01:10:35.895
There also was severe sexual torture.

01:10:37.183 --> 01:10:41.438
Including things like electrocution of genitals,

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:45.443
and things that are too horrible to say out loud.

01:10:53.158 --> 01:10:55.081
While she was in the hospital,

01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:58.000
a lot of her injuries seemed to get worse instead of better,

01:10:57.996 --> 01:11:00.294
and we couldn't figure it out.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:03.965
Then I realized that pain, not just pain, but brutal pain,

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.213
had been such a huge part of her life for so long

01:11:06.212 --> 01:11:08.510
she didn't know how to exist without it.

01:11:08.506 --> 01:11:11.134
She no longer knew how to exist in the world

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:13.728
if not through horrific pain.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.441
She was torturing herself when nobody was looking.

01:11:17.432 --> 01:11:21.562
It was very strange, seeing Cheryl after all that time.

01:11:23.021 --> 01:11:24.443
You know, the time that she was missing,

01:11:24.439 --> 01:11:26.737
I went from being a carefree college girl

01:11:26.733 --> 01:11:29.202
to having two girls of my own.

01:11:30.778 --> 01:11:32.746
It was hard to see the girl that I loved

01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:34.662
and the girl that came back.

01:12:00.725 --> 01:12:02.773
I don't know.

01:12:02.769 --> 01:12:06.649
I don't know what you want me to say.

01:12:06.648 --> 01:12:10.778
Talk about what it's like being home again.

01:12:11.653 --> 01:12:13.655
I don't know.

01:12:13.655 --> 01:12:15.874
What do you want me to say?

01:12:17.075 --> 01:12:17.917
It had to be nice

01:12:17.909 --> 01:12:19.536
seeing your mom again after all that time.

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:20.332
Yeah.

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:23.456
Maybe.

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:29.046
I don't know what you want me to say.

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:29.887
What was the man

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:32.849
you lived with all these years like?

01:12:38.263 --> 01:12:39.264
I don't know.

01:12:39.264 --> 01:12:42.234
I don't think that I want to do this anymore.

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:43.772
Why?

01:12:43.768 --> 01:12:47.818
'Cause I don't know what you want me to say.

01:12:47.814 --> 01:12:51.614
You can say anything you want.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:55.029
He loved me.

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:59.785
Nobody ever lets me say it, but it's true.

01:12:59.784 --> 01:13:00.751
He loved me.

01:13:02.287 --> 01:13:04.915
He didn't mean to leave me.

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:08.418
And someday he's gonna come back to me.

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:10.716
And he's gonna take me away.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:51.757
Well, another tragedy for this small family in Reading,

01:13:51.753 --> 01:13:53.426
Take a look here at the crime scene.

01:13:53.421 --> 01:13:55.594
The recently buried body of Cheryl Dempsey

01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:57.137
was stolen from her grave.

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:59.886
It happened here last night at Woodlawn Cemetery.

01:13:59.886 --> 01:14:02.014
The only thing left behind a broken casket.

01:14:02.013 --> 01:14:03.481
As you can see, a real mess.

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:05.521
Police are now investigating a possible link

01:14:05.516 --> 01:14:08.269
between this demented crime and a serial killer

01:14:08.269 --> 01:14:10.363
who has been tormenting the East Coast

01:14:10.355 --> 01:14:12.449
known as the Water Street Butcher.

01:14:20.615 --> 01:14:24.085
My feeling is that he's moved somewhere else.

01:14:24.077 --> 01:14:27.832
I doubt very strongly that he's stopped killing.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:32.461
I doubt very strongly that anyone even knows he's there.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.679
But in some town out there,

01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:39.768
the disappearance and murder rates are rising,

01:14:39.759 --> 01:14:44.515
and somewhere out there he's responsible for it.

01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:46.391
Something I find interesting about these tapes

01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:47.813
is that they're numbered sequentially,

01:14:47.809 --> 01:14:51.939
but there were 27 tapes missing when we found them.

01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:57.823
I wonder what was on those tapes.

01:14:57.819 --> 01:14:59.321
I wonder if they were just too private

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.448
for him to let anyone see.

01:15:03.074 --> 01:15:05.577
Or if his face was visible in those,

01:15:05.576 --> 01:15:09.206
or if they revealed just too much about him.

01:15:11.249 --> 01:15:15.595
Or maybe they were worse than anything that we've seen.

01:15:15.586 --> 01:15:18.180
I'll tell you one place we'll be watching.

01:15:18.172 --> 01:15:20.015
If this documentary thing you're making

01:15:20.007 --> 01:15:22.351
ever gets to the theaters,

01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:25.438
he won't be able to help himself.

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:29.151
He'll see this movie as many times as he can.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.312
We'll keep an eye on as many screenings as we can,

01:15:32.311 --> 01:15:34.188
because he'll be there.

01:20:24.603 --> 01:20:26.697
I'll make you a deal.

01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:30.284
You can live as long as you don't blink.
