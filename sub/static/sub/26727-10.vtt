WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:03.670
-Vanquish the vampires!
-Vanquish the vampires!

00:14.264 --> 00:15.098
Are you okay?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.600
At least carry some sedatives with you.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.893
I searched for you.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.562
Remember me?

00:20.937 --> 00:23.064
You barged into my research lab
at the university

00:23.314 --> 00:25.734
and beat me until the bones
in my face shattered.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.697
I'm happy to run into you.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.033
What do you want?

00:33.324 --> 00:34.409
Stop playing innocent!

00:34.659 --> 00:37.537
Do you know much I've suffered since then?

00:37.954 --> 00:40.457
They fired me from the university,
then I got divorced.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.417
My ex-wife cleaned me out
in child support payments.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.920
And finally, a student posted
private information about me.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.466
You started this nightmare that day.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.802
My life was ruined from that day on.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.346
I'm a failure as far as society
is concerned.

00:55.597 --> 00:56.765
And it's all your fault.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.477
I don't care. I never wanted
to see your face again.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.812
Is that because you and I are the same?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.022
What?

01:04.147 --> 01:05.899
I did my research on vampires.

01:06.608 --> 01:10.320
Seems like your bloodlust
and sexual lust come together.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.239
You transformed back then.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.619
You couldn't hide it
even if you tried, you pervert!

01:17.702 --> 01:22.123
It turned you on, didn't it?
Seeing Tsukasa Taira naked with me and...

03:03.141 --> 03:05.977
So, what's the meaning
of this transformation?

03:06.185 --> 03:07.937
Is it because you remembered Taira naked?

03:08.354 --> 03:11.107
Or could it be because of this blood?

03:11.774 --> 03:16.154
Don't tell me my blood turns you on!
That's nasty!

03:16.321 --> 03:17.906
Are you hard?

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
You can't even look at a guy's nosebleed?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.368
You vampires really are pathetic!

03:24.704 --> 03:27.707
I feel like I've heard this before.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.586
You even get excited when you see
my blood? I'm just an old man!

03:31.669 --> 03:33.379
Vampires really are pathetic!

03:33.755 --> 03:35.798
This is just ketchup!

03:36.341 --> 03:39.677
Looks like I got your mind off it.
You stopped changing.

03:40.136 --> 03:44.474
I guess you only change
when you're lusting after Tsukasa.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.644
I've beaten a guy once and he bled a lot.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.230
Then an urge hit me.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.901
I lost my sense of reasoning,
and drank the blood of the guy I hated.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.738
The last time I hit this dumbass,

03:59.405 --> 04:01.032
I didn't get the urge!

04:01.574 --> 04:05.453
Do you have someone
whom you would do anything to protect?

04:05.995 --> 04:07.997
You'll never understand how I feel!

04:08.539 --> 04:10.458
Blood is just a little factor.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.294
The biggest reason
for my transformations is...

04:14.629 --> 04:15.797
What's wrong with this guy?

04:16.047 --> 04:17.548
He just calmed down.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.970
What's with my eyes? Why am I calm inside?

04:23.304 --> 04:25.598
I don't really get what's going on,
but don't spoil the party.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.934
You mean you weren't turned on
by my blood?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.185
I wasn't.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.022
Tabuse, open the door to the next car
and wait inside. I'll be right there.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.024
You're going to use it now?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.318
If not now, then when?

04:37.485 --> 04:38.569
What the hell are you doing?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.947
Something more exciting!

04:44.242 --> 04:45.660
It smells good, doesn't it?

04:47.662 --> 04:50.415
The vigilantes came up with this
and called it a "blood ball."

04:50.832 --> 04:52.250
They have real blood inside.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.085
These are works of art.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.129
You got two of them. You should be happy!

04:56.504 --> 04:59.382
For a second, I was so close...

04:59.882 --> 05:03.636
I almost found peace
to stabilize my transformation.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.266
Damn it. My body is so hot.
I'm losing control.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.769
After that, did the two of you do it?

05:12.186 --> 05:15.231
When vampires have sex with humans,
do they suck their blood the whole time?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.650
Don't tell me you screwed her to death!

05:18.318 --> 05:21.112
If things were going to end like this,
I should have just had her

05:21.446 --> 05:24.574
and you could've had my leftovers!

05:27.452 --> 05:28.995
That's crazy!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.249
Let's get out of here!

05:36.294 --> 05:37.128
Hold the door!

05:37.211 --> 05:38.838
-What is that?
-A vampire is on a train!

05:38.921 --> 05:39.922
That's scary!

05:40.339 --> 05:41.174
It's Anzai?

05:41.632 --> 05:42.467
Somebody...

05:43.092 --> 05:47.138
Close all the doors. Open only the doors
to the fifth car, where the vampire is!

05:53.394 --> 05:54.312
Somebody...

05:57.899 --> 05:58.733
Somebody...

05:59.358 --> 06:00.443
Somebody, take me...

06:07.617 --> 06:09.535
I made it in time.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.039
Take me into the light.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.635
The person who uploaded that video

06:25.885 --> 06:30.139
was the professor who tried
to harass Ms. Taira and was fired.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.188
All vampire employees
are banned from investigations.

06:37.939 --> 06:42.110
Squad F's vampires are also banned
from going outside unsupervised, right?

06:42.652 --> 06:46.030
And now, one has transformed
on public transportation,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.324
and there's even video evidence
all over the Internet.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.828
We'll hand down the punishment
in due time,

06:52.161 --> 06:54.789
but don't think it'll end
with just a house arrest for that officer.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.293
Also, Sawazaki, weren't you relieved
of your duties as squad leader?

06:59.627 --> 07:00.628
What happened to Ishimaru?

07:01.879 --> 07:04.423
Isn't this crazy? I can't believe it.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.176
-Vanquish the vampires!
-Vanquish the vampires!

07:07.260 --> 07:12.432
-Vanquish the vampires!
-Vanquish the vampires!

07:16.227 --> 07:17.228
Ishimaru.

07:17.603 --> 07:23.401
So, there's someone on the vigilante corps
who has a grudge against you.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.361
I didn't expect that.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.196
What's going to happen to me?

07:27.447 --> 07:31.784
Internally, I suppose you'll be given
the most merciful penalty possible.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.786
In any case, we took the position

07:33.870 --> 07:37.832
that you weren't on duty,
and that it was just a case of bad timing.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.919
If we hadn't, what happened
could have cost you your job.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.424
The higher-ups are pretty upset
about the uploaded video,

07:47.008 --> 07:50.678
but it was a blessing
that you didn't hurt the guy.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.891
This is an interesting image.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.395
Look. You've seen blood
and are starting to transform,

07:59.479 --> 08:00.980
but even so, you're calm.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.986
You should strip, too.
Things are going to get dirty.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.155
What are you doing?

08:10.531 --> 08:14.785
As your boss, I feel I should know
the extent of your abilities.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.665
Vampires are strong.

08:19.999 --> 08:23.169
Their basic physical strength
is way ahead of humans.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.881
You had enough room to strike me then.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.883
Please don't hold back.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.009
I can't.

08:30.551 --> 08:34.055
When I transform, I have no idea
how much I can control it.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.474
That's why I would like to conduct
an experiment.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.394
What are you thinking? Stop!

08:40.561 --> 08:42.104
Right now, it's just you and me.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.898
Your girlfriend's not here.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.735
Even if you go crazy,
I'll be able to stop you.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.028
Stop this.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.490
-Why do you want to...
-You, of all people, should be able to.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.659
Good morning.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.786
Good morning.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.705
Where's Mr. Anzai?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.250
He went off somewhere with Ishimaru.

09:04.752 --> 09:05.836
Anzai.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.506
Don't worry.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.757
Come at me.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.093
Stop screwing around!

09:12.468 --> 09:14.470
I read all of your entries.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.432
You fear your transformed self.

09:18.641 --> 09:23.145
But, you have a strong desire
to control yourself.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.901
Hit me once.

09:30.027 --> 09:30.861
Hurry up!

09:32.029 --> 09:32.863
I got...

09:34.031 --> 09:35.116
See? You're faster.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.205
Stay alert.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.167
You haven't realized it, have you?
You're controlling yourself.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.461
Didn't the same thing happen yesterday?

09:49.171 --> 09:50.923
Could it be?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.550
You see, don't you?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.636
I honestly wasn't able to avoid that hit.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.430
There's your answer.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.725
You've transformed, but you're still calm.

10:01.350 --> 10:05.563
Your body is now experiencing
a benign transformative reaction.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.442
Your senses are heightened,
your reflexes improved,

10:09.525 --> 10:11.444
and your muscular strength is at its peak.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.237
It's nearly 100 percent.

10:13.654 --> 10:17.158
And you're using logic
to control yourself.

10:18.034 --> 10:22.204
That's the hidden potential inside you
that you haven't realized.

10:22.913 --> 10:23.998
Potential?

10:25.082 --> 10:27.460
It may be that the sight of blood

10:27.543 --> 10:30.963
isn't what really triggers
your transformations.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.548
Could it be that you're...

10:33.299 --> 10:34.967
Who the heck are you?

10:35.843 --> 10:38.346
You're fast! Can you see my movements?

10:39.263 --> 10:41.265
Answer me! Why do you know
all of this about me?

10:41.349 --> 10:43.017
At the very least, I'm not your enemy!

10:45.186 --> 10:47.938
Time for the next stage. Drink some blood.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.441
I'll be okay.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.943
I can protect myself.

10:53.444 --> 10:56.614
Don't you want to learn more
about that potential of yours?

10:56.947 --> 10:58.532
My potential?

11:00.701 --> 11:01.619
Ms. Taira!

11:02.912 --> 11:03.996
Mr. Anzai?

11:04.914 --> 11:05.915
Here goes.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.382
Wait!

11:15.299 --> 11:17.093
That's not necessary.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.804
He's able to control himself.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.270
I didn't want to show Tsukasa
my transformed self.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.440
Don't worry.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.360
It seems like that guy knows
a lot about vampires.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.614
I've always liked vampires.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.827
One of my childhood friends was one.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.579
Because of that, I started
learning more about them.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.001
You do know what will happen
if you make him transform, right?

11:51.210 --> 11:54.630
I know about how much he transforms
and how it happens.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.090
As well as how to deal with it.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.383
That's not what I mean.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.719
I'm asking if you understand how a human
forced to transform would feel.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.600
My apologies.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.444
It's no good. I can't access it.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.445
What does that mean?

12:17.862 --> 12:20.364
The computer at the hideout
isn't connected to the Internet.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.824
That means I can't hack it.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.325
Is it usually offline?

12:23.409 --> 12:26.287
No, they might have taken it offline
to prevent it from being hacked.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.833
Only Zero-Two or Zero-Six
would have thought of that.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.586
Are these numbers ranked
in order of importance?

12:34.044 --> 12:37.798
Zero-Two is the leader,
but the rest are random, I think.

12:37.965 --> 12:38.966
Who's number one?

12:39.425 --> 12:42.178
The investor, but I'm not sure who it is.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.305
Then who are the others?

12:44.555 --> 12:45.848
That, well...

12:46.098 --> 12:47.516
Why are you hesitating?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.435
What do you mean they don't exist?

12:49.935 --> 12:52.688
I've never met them at the hideout
or heard them mentioned,

12:52.938 --> 12:54.273
so I guess those numbers were skipped.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.525
But I don't have any proof.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.237
So 13 isn't "Thirteen," but "Jason"?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.072
I don't know.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.075
I know they exist,
but I don't know their name.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.327
This is bad.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.245
You don't have proof of the missing ones.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.416
If you looked at the list, you could see
which ones are missing.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.879
To get the list, we might have
to enter their hideout.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.883
I wish we could ask other squads
for help, but there could be a spy.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.344
Unfortunately, it might just be us.

13:23.719 --> 13:24.887
You may be right.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.976
Have you solved your hatred for vampires?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.395
I'll put it on hold for now.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.191
Are you angry with me?

13:37.691 --> 13:40.152
For putting a hole through your chest.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.030
Angry? About being shot?

13:43.572 --> 13:44.490
Mr. Anzai.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.492
Forget about me. Apologize to Tsukasa!

13:47.243 --> 13:51.413
When you broke the window,
a piece of glass cut her face open!

13:52.915 --> 13:56.544
Oh, I'm not that concerned about it.
In fact, I kind of...

13:56.669 --> 13:58.212
Hole in your chest?

13:58.504 --> 13:59.505
What are you doing?

13:59.630 --> 14:01.298
This is the first I'm hearing about this.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.300
-That kind of wound--
-Stop it!

14:04.468 --> 14:05.761
Isn't your healing a bit fast?

14:06.011 --> 14:08.097
A 7.62mm bullet passed through you!

14:08.973 --> 14:11.475
That's right. Back then, you were...

14:11.600 --> 14:13.310
Stop talking about that.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.771
You'll lose your heads.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.773
Kano.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.191
What's that?

14:19.733 --> 14:21.068
Why would you say that?

14:21.610 --> 14:25.281
Anyway, almost everyone here
already knows about Anzai's injury.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.658
Keep this to yourselves.

14:27.908 --> 14:32.746
There was a detective who knew vampires
could heal by drinking human blood.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.874
Was he dismissed?

14:35.374 --> 14:38.711
Technically speaking,
he was transferred from fieldwork.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.379
It was effectively a demotion and he quit.

14:41.171 --> 14:45.759
Even in the medical industry,
blood treatment is classified information.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.679
Looks like this guy already knew.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.431
Why is it classified?

14:50.806 --> 14:53.976
Because vampires might attack humans
just to heal themselves?

14:54.226 --> 14:55.144
Most likely.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.313
We wouldn't do such a thing.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.899
Generally speaking,
vampires aren't trusted.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.276
Especially those who have transformed.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.404
Then if we know, aren't we in danger?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.157
That's why this secret
doesn't leave this room.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.869
I don't think I should lose
my subordinates over such a thing.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.748
Sawazaki, report to me
regarding the status of this injury.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.041
Understood.

15:17.207 --> 15:20.044
Okay. The rest of you, take a break.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.296
Do you have a minute?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.342
Actually, I have something for you.

15:27.301 --> 15:32.056
New restraints. There are instructions
inside, so knock yourself out.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.516
So?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.353
When I transform, I remember things.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.773
I'm a child, and there's a man by my side.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.524
A man you know?

15:42.733 --> 15:43.984
Kirio Kikuhara.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.153
An officer of Public Safety Division 5.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.821
What's the matter?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.783
I feel like that name
has passed my lips before.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.327
Are you sure you haven't met him before?

15:53.786 --> 15:54.620
I haven't.

15:54.703 --> 15:59.458
You might have repressed it
like a bad memory.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.710
It's a form of self-preservation.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.837
If that's the case,
it's better you don't recall it.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.633
This is different from a self-analysis
that's for the sake of knowing yourself.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.426
There are things
you're better off not knowing.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.304
Did you think you wanted to remember?

16:12.763 --> 16:15.933
I thought I might understand
something important if I did.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.645
Underground, there are a lot
of scary vampires,

16:20.187 --> 16:21.939
and I was told I was one of them.

16:22.856 --> 16:27.027
The reason why I dislike vampires
might lie in my memory of Kikuhara.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.488
You didn't like vampires, did you?

16:29.738 --> 16:30.572
Oh, no.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.074
I'm not blaming you.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.535
Everyone has dislikes and prejudices.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.037
Pretending you don't
doesn't help anything.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.915
I believe I told you
to understand yourself.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.585
"People and vampires
should live separately,

16:44.294 --> 16:46.463
because vampires are dangerous,"
or so I had always thought.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.967
I could never remember why I thought that.

16:50.968 --> 16:55.139
That's why I couldn't get angry
at Zero-Seven even if she hates vampires.

16:55.889 --> 16:59.810
Deliberation continues today at the Diet
over the vampire regulation bill.

17:00.519 --> 17:04.273
The rush in public interest
has ignited a debate between parties.

17:04.732 --> 17:08.318
Kikuhara might be the reason
behind my hatred for vampires.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.363
To think that it might be a memory
so horrible that I repressed it.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.366
What could have happened to me?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.828
But I was only a kid at the time.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.832
If I remembered it now,
I might be able to handle it.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.127
Oh, you're awake!

17:25.627 --> 17:26.795
I was reading some papers.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.672
You can't sleep?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.925
I got thirsty, so I'm making tea.
Do you want some?

17:33.510 --> 17:34.344
Sure.

17:35.888 --> 17:36.805
Well...

17:37.014 --> 17:37.848
What is it?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.516
The other day, on the train...

17:41.477 --> 17:43.062
If you're talking about that guy,
don't worry.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.898
They arrested him,
so he's out of our hair.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.901
There's no reason for you
to feel responsible, either.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.027
Thank you.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.862
Also, about today.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.575
The thing with Ishimaru,
I'm sorry if I shocked you.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.746
Don't worry.
I was a little surprised, but I'm fine.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.792
Lee said Ishimaru knows
a lot about vampires.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.379
He said he was doing it for your sake.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.008
But honestly, I was a little jealous.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.554
I really wish I could give you my blood,

18:18.430 --> 18:20.516
if it would help you.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.309
Tsukasa.

18:22.726 --> 18:23.894
I still feel that way.

18:24.812 --> 18:29.149
Why can't I be the one to feed you blood?

18:29.483 --> 18:30.400
It's silly, I know.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.362
Sorry.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.114
It's pretty childish of me.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.281
I'm embarrassed.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.659
You're amazing.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.452
Absolutely full of surprises.

18:40.911 --> 18:44.081
How can you say
your true feelings that easily?

18:46.542 --> 18:49.878
I think your honesty brought me this far.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.381
Mr. Anzai.

18:52.673 --> 18:57.678
Ishimaru referred to my transformation
as a "benign transformative reaction."

18:57.970 --> 18:58.804
Benign?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.597
If blood was the factor,

19:01.014 --> 19:03.100
I would be able to control
my feelings and calm myself.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.644
If that were the case,

19:06.019 --> 19:06.854
then someday,

19:07.146 --> 19:10.023
I would be able to live peacefully
without fearing vampires.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.109
Someday.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.864
I hope that day comes soon.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.535
But right now, I still...

19:23.120 --> 19:24.121
Don't worry.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.291
I promise not to give you my blood!

19:30.043 --> 19:33.589
If there's anything else I can do,
just tell me.

19:34.047 --> 19:34.882
Yes.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.675
I've been thinking about it lately.

19:36.967 --> 19:41.471
I wonder if there's anything I can do
for you and the other vampires.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.640
I think there's something.

19:43.849 --> 19:48.687
Something neither you nor Sawazaki
and the police are doing.

19:49.062 --> 19:49.897
Tsukasa.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.066
Sawazaki checking in.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.986
There has been a fire in Taito Ward,
Squad G's jurisdiction.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.530
The fire seems to have come
from a vampire rights activist's house.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.158
The owner is a businessman,
Shiraki Souzou.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.118
Even if it's not official,

20:03.452 --> 20:05.537
he is a renowned supporter
of vampire rights.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.706
It's not yet clear at the moment,

20:07.915 --> 20:10.292
but it's possible anti-vampire groups
are using him to warn others.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.299
I'm part of an investigation

20:17.382 --> 20:20.385
looking for suspected vampire
mass murderer, Tamaki Anzai.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.641
Kikuhara!

20:25.974 --> 20:28.644
-Anzai, you can't go off by--
-Come with me!

20:29.061 --> 20:32.272
"Vampire mass murderer, Tamaki Anzai?"

20:34.107 --> 20:35.359
Can I help you?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.570
If I remember correctly,
aren't you suspended?

20:39.112 --> 20:40.948
You met me long ago, didn't you?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.326
I already told you,
it was the new staff ceremony.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.745
No, over ten years ago.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.791
The vampire mass murderer, Tamaki Anzai.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.919
He doesn't have any memory of it?

20:54.378 --> 20:55.629
I can't believe it.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.051
Go home.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.970
You're in the way of the investigation.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.596
Kirio Kikuhara.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.682
Who are you?

21:08.767 --> 21:10.435
And who the hell are you?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.231
Someone who doesn't remember
what happened that day

21:14.314 --> 21:16.191
has no right to ask me who I am.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.820
I remember everything
that has happened to me.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.863
No matter how painful.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.283
They all belong to me.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.037
Excuse me.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.836
Did I want to remember?

23:16.853 --> 23:18.105
Reporting.

23:18.730 --> 23:19.898
You're late,

23:20.398 --> 23:21.566
Jason.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.746
Devils' Line.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.456
Line 11.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.833
Ouroboros.
